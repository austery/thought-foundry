### AI技术与数字安全挑战

科技的**潘多拉魔盒**（Pandora's Box: 指一旦打开就会释放出无数灾难的源头）已经开启。现实情况是，孩子们在人工智能的陪伴下成长，他们与那些总是说“是”、表示同意并安抚他们的系统对话，因为这些系统就是被训练成这样做的。与此同时，AI也被用于一些非常可怕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Pandora box of technology is already open. The reality is that kids are growing up with AI and they're talking to systems that are saying yes, that are agreeing to them, that are placating them because that's what these systems are trained to do. At the same time, it's being used for really horrible things.</p>
</details>

我认为存在一个真正的担忧，从垃圾邮件和**AI生成垃圾内容**（AI slop: 指由AI生成的大量低质量、重复或无意义的内容）到高度针对性、高度情境化的**网络钓鱼活动**（fishing campaigns: 通过伪装成可信实体来骗取用户敏感信息的网络诈骗），再到通过创建**未经同意的私密图像**（Non-Consensual Intimate Imagery, NCI: 指未经当事人同意而创建、传播或分享的私密性图片或视频）来伤害受害者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a real there's a real worry. Everything from just spam and AI slop from that to highly targeted, highly contextual fishing campaigns to victimizing people by creating non-consensual intimate imagery.</p>
</details>

必须有人能够阻止这些可怕的事情发生，这样创新才能继续。因为如果你不这样做，最终会发生的是，将会有严格的监管。他们将不得不停止创新并修复问题，然后才能继续创新，这会减缓整个社会创新的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Someone needs to be able to stop those horrible things from happening so innovation can continue because if you don't what's going to end up happening is that there's going to be regulation. They're going to have to stop and fix things and before they can innovate and it slows down ability to innovate as a society.</p>
</details>

所以，我希望我们能够成为阻止这些可怕事情发生并在此基础上进行创新的人，让其他人能够以极快的速度进行创新。我是Glen Wise，**Cinder**（一个专注于信任与安全运营的中央平台）的联合创始人兼首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what I want to do is be able to we should be able to be the ones that are stopping those horrible things and innovating on that and allow everyone else to innovate incredibly quickly. I'm Glenn Wise. I'm the co-founder CEO of Cinder, a central platform for trust and safety operations.</p>
</details>

你可以把Cinder想象成互联网的“看门人”。我们的客户希望能够设定在其平台上允许和不允许的内容规则。因此，Cinder就是他们用来对其所有用户强制执行这些规则的系统。我们从**Y Combinator**（知名创业加速器）和**Accel**（一家领先的风险投资公司）等投资者那里筹集了1400万美元。我们的使命是让互联网成为一个更安全的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can think of Cinder as the club bouncer for the internet. Our customers want to be able to set rules on what they allow on their platforms and what they don't allow. And so Cinder is the system that they use to enforce those rules across all of their users. We raised $14 million from investors such as Y Cominator and Excel. Our mission is to make the internet a safer place.</p>
</details>

### 从反恐到互联网安全：个人转型之路

在新泽西州长大，在9/11事件发生时我只有六七岁，那对我个人和我的社区来说都是一个极具影响力的时刻。当你在这样的背景下成长时，任何有机会参与更大使命的机会对我来说都非常重要。所以，当我上大学时，我意识到你实际上可以去**NSA**（美国国家安全局）、**CIA**（美国中央情报局）或**FBI**（美国联邦调查局）工作，处理确保类似事件不再发生的具体问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So growing up in New Jersey, being 6 or 7 years old during 911, that was such an impactful sort of moment in my life and my community. And when you grow up with that in the backdrop, any opportunity to be part of a greater mission was really important to me. So then when I went to college and I realized that you can actually go work at the NSA or the CIA or the FBI on these exact issues of making sure that never happens again.</p>
</details>

那是我唯一想做的事情。因此，这不可避免地引导我加入了政府，从事反恐工作，这又不可避免地导致我在**Facebook**的威胁情报团队从事相同类型的工作。Facebook在危害在平台上普遍出现之前就开始大力投资**威胁情报**（threat intelligence: 收集和分析关于潜在威胁的信息，以预测、预防和应对网络攻击）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the the only thing I wanted to do. And so that inevitably led me to join government being able to work on counterterrorism issues which inevitably led to me doing the same type of work at at Facebook on a threat intelligence team. Facebook started investing heavily in threat intelligence before the harm became prevalent on platform.</p>
</details>

我认为成为**红队**（red team: 模拟攻击者进行安全测试的团队，旨在发现系统漏洞）的一员是人们能拥有的最有趣的工作之一，因为你可以尝试“破坏”事物。这是我今天灌输给我团队的理念：你如何拥有那种**对抗性思维**（adversarial mindset: 站在攻击者的角度思考问题）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Being on a red team, I think, is one of the most fun jobs that someone could have and someone can do because you get to, you know, try to break things. This is something that I instill on my team today. It's like, how do you have that adversarial mindset, right?</p>
</details>

总会有另一方的人试图阻止你，你必须认识到这一点并能够像他们一样思考。当时，我与许多其他公司交流，他们都在努力应对其平台上发生的滥用行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's going to be people on the other side of that trying to stop you and you have to acknowledge that and be able to think like that. At the time, I was talking to so many other companies that were really struggling with getting a grasp on the abuse occurring on their platform.</p>
</details>

### 创业之路：从犹豫到坚定

所以，我认为这将是一个非常有趣的创业方向。我思考了很长时间，甚至在工作之余也一直在想这件事。我犹豫创立Cinder的部分原因是，我当时觉得我还没有准备好，我觉得我没有足够的经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I thought that this would be a really interesting thing to start. I was thinking about it for a long time to the point where, you know, it's all I thought about outside of work. Part of my hesitation of founding Cinder that I just thought I wasn't ready, right? I felt I didn't have the right experience.</p>
</details>

我最初的想法是去一家小公司，帮助他们内部构建一个平台。后来，我联系了很多人，意识到有很多公司可以选择来内部构建一些东西，但在那种情况下，你不如一次性集中构建它，然后提供给所有这些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My initial thought at the time was to go to a smaller company and help them build, you know, a platform internally. So, I ended up just reaching out to a bunch of people. And I realized that there were a lot of companies to choose from to build something internally that at that point you should just build it once centrally and then give it to all these companies.</p>
</details>

这作为一项业务非常有意义，这也是我最终决定创立它的原因。我认为这很重要。必须有人能够阻止那些可怕的事情发生，这样创新才能继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. It just like made so much sense as a business. That's inevitably why I made the decision to to found it. And I think that it's important. Someone needs to be able to stop those horrible things from happening so innovation can continue.</p>
</details>

所以，我希望我们能够成为阻止这些可怕事情发生并在此基础上进行创新的人，让其他人能够以极快的速度进行创新，部署新事物，构建新事物，而无需担心互联网的阴暗面和那些有害的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what I want to do is be able to we should be able to be the ones that are stopping those horrible things and innovating on that allow everyone else to innovate incredibly quickly and deploying new things and building new things without worrying about this underbelly of the internet and these underbelly of of harmful people.</p>
</details>

我申请了Y Combinator，当时觉得不会有什么结果，你知道，就在截止日期前一两个小时。结果接到了**Michael Seibel**（Y Combinator的合伙人）的电话，Michael告诉我他觉得这个想法很棒，他对此非常兴奋，他希望我去做，但我需要找到一位联合创始人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I applied to Y Comer thinking that nothing would happen, you know, literally an hour or two before the deadline was due. Uh ended up getting a call from Michael Cyel and Michael told me that he thought the idea was great. He's really excited about it. He wants us to he wants me to do it, but I need to find a co-founder.</p>
</details>

我告诉他，我在Facebook工作时认识一些非常出色的人，我真的很想和他们一起工作，但要让他们离开Facebook并加入创业几乎是不可能的。然而，快进三个月后，我拥有了一个我非常尊敬的优秀团队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I told him that there were people that I worked with at Facebook that I thought were really amazing people that I really wanted to work with, but it's going to be impossible for me to get them to to leave Facebook and to actually join starting this. And fast forward 3 months later, had a really great team of people that I was really respected.</p>
</details>

能够和他们每天一起工作真是太棒了，现在依然如此。能够把所有这些人召集起来并与他们一起工作，对我来说是一个非常特殊的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and it was amazing that I mean still is amazing that I get to work with them every day. Bring all these people on and and work with them was a really special moment for me.</p>
</details>

### Cinder的成长与挑战

仅今年一年，通过Cinder，我们的客户就提交了超过10万份报告给**美国国家失踪与受剥削儿童中心**（National Center for Missing and Exploited Children）。这个数字本身就相当惊人，但这只是所有真正糟糕事情的冰山一角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This year alone with Cinder, our customers have submitted over 100,000 reports. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That alone is a pretty insane number, but it's also just like scratching the surface of all of the really bad things.</p>
</details>

我们今天看到的滥用行为，在四年前只有国家才能做到。而今天，一个拿着笔记本电脑的青少年就能做到。作为一个社会，我们需要能够对抗这种滥用的系统，以免它演变成一个彻底的地狱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We see abuse today that 4 years ago only a nation state could do. And today, a teenager with a laptop is able to do it. As a society, we need systems that can combat this abuse before it turns into a total hellscape.</p>
</details>

当我们开始构建Cinder时，我们知道我们将要构建一个平台，这真的很有挑战性，我鼓励任何人都不要从一开始就构建一个平台，因为你必须在其之上构建太多东西才能使其正常运行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we set out to build Cinder, we knew that we were going to build a platform and that is really challenging and I would encourage anyone to not build a platform from the beginning because you have to build so many things on top of it in order for it just to work, right?</p>
</details>

你必须能够整合所有这些信号。你必须能够使其高度可配置和可定制。你必须能够让客户在其中表示他们自己独特的数据和独特的工作流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to be able to integrate all these signals. You have to be able to make it highly configurable and customizable. You have to be able for customers to represent their own unique data and their own unique workflow within it.</p>
</details>

所以，我们最初做了大量工作来支持所有这些不同的内容类型，支持所有这些不同类型的工作流程，这需要很长时间。我们着手构建的实际上是一个用于信任与安全的威胁情报平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we did a lot of work initially to support all these different content types to support all these different types of workflows that takes a long time. We set out to build what was effectively a threat intel platform for trust and safety.</p>
</details>

我们认为这是一个很棒的主意，因为我们在以前的工作中看到了这种痛苦，我们打算解决它并将其带给所有人。所以我们花了所有这些时间构建这个平台，然后我们出去展示给人们看，他们实际上告诉我们这很有趣，但他们不想要它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we thought this was a great idea because we saw that pain in previous jobs and we were going to go solve it and bring it to everyone else. So we spent all this time building this platform and then we went out to show people and they effectively told us that this was interesting but they did not want it.</p>
</details>

他们真正需要的是一种处理其整体运营的方法，所以我们投入了所有这些时间，我和联合创始人**Declan**花了这么多时间构建这个威胁情报平台，结果却被告知他们想要别的东西，这对我们来说是一个巨大的教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what they really needed was a way to handle their overall operations and so we invested all this time uh in me and Declan one of the co-founders spent so much time building this thread intel platform to be told that they wanted something else and that's like a huge learning for us right.</p>
</details>

这让我们认识到真正专注于核心客户问题的重要性，将问题定义得非常精确，然后再去构建产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that that brings us to this idea of really focusing ing on what the core customer problem is and get that problem down really tight and then go out and build.</p>
</details>

### 构建有效产品的核心：同理心与使命驱动

从我职业生涯一开始，我的重点就是如何阻止人们利用和滥用其他系统或其他人。所以，能够与客户产生**同理心**（empathize: 理解并分享他人的感受）是关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And my focus from like the beginning of my career has been on how do you stop people from taking advantage and and abusing other systems or or people. And so being able to empathize with the customer was really key, right?</p>
</details>

即使我们什么都还没构建出来，有人能够倾听他们，理解他们正在经历什么，并提供解决建议，然后几周后带着一个真正解决问题的产品出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even when we had nothing built, someone being able to listen to them and understand what they were going through and provide suggestions on how to fix it and then a few weeks later come with a product. It solved a real problem.</p>
</details>

如今，AI客户面临的一个非常突出的危害就是**未经同意的私密图像**（NCI）。随着时间的推移，我们看到危害变得越来越复杂。在Cinder，我们有一个名为“**决策谱系**”（decision spectrum: 一种框架，用于将问题根据其复杂性进行分类）的框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a really prominent harm facing Gai customers today is basically non-consensual intimate imagery NCI. We are seeing harms become more and more complex as time goes on. At Cinder, we have a framework called the decision spectrum.</p>
</details>

几乎所有问题都可以以某种方式放在这个谱系上，谱系的左侧是非常简单的事情，比如一个非常简单的决定：是的，这张图片是裸体，或者这个聊天信息是欺诈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And almost every problem can be placed on the spectrum in some way where on the left side of the spectrum is a really something really simple, like a really simple decision of yeah, this image is nudity or this uh chat message is fraud, right?</p>
</details>

这就像是对单个内容或单个事件的非常简单的识别。而在另一侧，你可能正在调查一个非常复杂的国家行为者，或者一个非常复杂的网络，或者一个试图隐藏其行为的高级对手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like a really simple identification of a single piece of content or a single event. And on the other side, you're investigating some, you know, a really complex nation state or really complex network or an adversary that is advanced in trying to hide their behavior.</p>
</details>

有太多的事情需要审查，而且优先级排序非常困难，因为每件事都是一种伤害，每件事都在伤害别人。这种职业倦怠是真实存在的，你经常看到这个行业的人们因为觉得自己几乎是在面对一场逆风的战斗而精疲力尽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are way too many things to review and prioritizing is really difficult because everything is a heart, right? Everything is hurting someone else. And that burnout is real. and you see people burning out the industry all the time because they almost feel like there's they're facing an uphill battle of targeting this.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为我们的团队，我们确实看到了一些这样的情况，但对我们来说，公司里的每个人都深受使命的驱动，每个人都希望最终能有一个互联网和创新都是安全的世界，任何人都可以使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think our team, you know, we we definitely see some of that, but for us, everyone at our company is deeply motivated by the mission and everyone wants to inevitably have a world where the internet and innovation is is safe and can be used by anyone.</p>
</details>

我们的创始团队在许多不同地方构建这些系统方面拥有直接经验。我们亲身经历了那种伤害，亲身经历了那种痛苦。我认为在这个领域，你能够构建有效产品的唯一方法是拥有那种经验，同时也要对使命有吸引力，对结果有吸引力，并且这一切背后都有一个目的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And our founding team had direct experience in building these systems at many different places. And we experienced that harm firsthand, right? We experienced that painoint firsthand. I think in this space, the only way that you're able to build an effective product is by having that experience, but also having that attraction to the mission and having that attraction to the outcome and having that purpose behind it all.</p>
</details>

因为这项工作非常困难，非常复杂且非常微妙，你必须拥有那种驱动力。当你听到我们团队讲述我们阻止了什么，或者我们帮助制止了什么，或者我们发现了一种滥用行为的故事时，这让我们能够继续前进，对第二天充满动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the the work is so difficult. It is very complex and very nuanced that you have to have that that drive. When you hear stories from our teams of something that we took down or something that we helped stop or an abuse that we caught that allows us to go on, right, and be really motive for the next day.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为你很容易被危害所困扰，你很容易看到互联网上发生的所有可怕的事情，并因此感到非常沮丧，但要知道有一条途径可以解决它。必须有人来对抗它，如果不是我们，那会是谁呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think you can it's you you can easily get bogged down in the harm, right? You can easily look at all of the really horrible things happening across the internet and and be really dejected from it, but know that there's a path to being able to come at it. and someone needs to combat it. And if it's not us, then you know who else is that going to be?</p>
</details>
