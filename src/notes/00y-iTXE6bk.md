<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm Nicola Tangan, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm in really good company with Emma Wsley, the CEO of GSK, one of the global leaders in pharmaceuticals.</p>
</details>

我们持有GSK 1.7%的股份，价值13亿美元。Emma，很高兴您能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we own 1.7% of GSK valued at$ 1.3 billion US. Emma, great to have you here.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 非常荣幸能来到这里，谢谢您的邀请。我相信这是您人生中第二次参加播客节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wonderful to be here. Thanks for having and I believe this is the second podcast ever in your life.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 第二次！哇。我非常期待这次对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second ever. Wow. Looking forward very much to the conversation. Very good.</p>
</details>

### GSK的研发前沿与创新

**Nicola Tangan:** 那么，目前哪些研究领域最让您感到兴奋呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, which areas of research excites you the most just now?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，我对于科学和技术在研究方面的进步感到非常兴奋，特别是这两者结合在一起的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, well, I'm excited about a lot of the ways that research both in science and technology are advancing and particularly those two things together.</p>
</details>

我们的公司宗旨就是创新，这也是我们大部分资本的投入方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it is literally the point of our company is to innovate and that's where we allocate most of our capital.</p>
</details>

事实上，自从我担任这个职位以来，我们的**R&D**（Research & Development: 研发）支出几乎翻了一番，这都是通过内部增长实现的，当然我们也通过外部合作和业务发展来补充我们的产品线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in fact since I've been in this job I think we've nearly doubled our R&D spend uh organically and then of course opened up huge amounts of partnerships that we do externally and business development to supplement the pipeline.</p>
</details>

最让我兴奋的是，我们能够以一种对全球患者产生真正大规模影响的方式进行创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What excites me most uh is when we can innovate in a way that has real impact at scale for patients around the world.</p>
</details>

因此，我非常期待今年将获得五种新药和疫苗的批准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm incredibly excited about five new approvals for new drugs and vaccines that we're expecting to get this year.</p>
</details>

目前已经有一个获得批准，还有四个即将到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One down and another four uh to go.</p>
</details>

这是我们预计在本十年内推出的14种大规模药物和疫苗中的第一批，每种都有潜力带来超过20亿英镑的销售额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the first wave of a cohort of we think 14 scale medicines and vaccines each with the potential of more than two billion pounds worth of sales that we expect to launch this decade and that includes uh in areas of oncology in infectious diseases in respiratory uh immunology in HIV and you know some of these what's really exciting is when you have totally new technology platforms in pharmaceuticals.</p>
</details>

这包括肿瘤学、传染病、呼吸免疫学和**HIV**（Human Immunodeficiency Virus: 人类免疫缺陷病毒）等领域。真正令人兴奋的是，当你在制药领域拥有全新的技术平台时，会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that includes uh in areas of oncology in infectious diseases in respiratory uh immunology in HIV and you know some of these what's really exciting is when you have totally new technology platforms in pharmaceuticals.</p>
</details>

例如，在**多发性骨髓瘤**（Multiple Myeloma: 一种血癌）这种非常恶性的血癌领域，每年有18万新诊断病例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example um in multiple myoma uh very nasty blood cancer that uh where there are 180,000 new diagnoses every year.</p>
</details>

我们拥有一个名为**抗体药物偶联物**（Antibody-Drug Conjugates, ADC: 一种靶向治疗药物，结合了抗体和化疗药物）的新技术平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a new technology platform something called antibbody drug conjugates and you have to think of these as like kind of biological missiles that have precision targeting for cancer which means they can bring greater efficacy uh but also with less side effects.</p>
</details>

您可以将其视为具有精确靶向性的生物导弹，这意味着它们能带来更高的疗效，同时副作用更少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a new technology platform something called antibbody drug conjugates and you have to think of these as like kind of biological missiles that have precision targeting for cancer which means they can bring greater efficacy uh but also with less side effects.</p>
</details>

我们有望推出一种新的多发性骨髓瘤药物，其数据显示能将预期寿命延长三年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we hopefully have a new multiple myoma drug uh that has data that proves it extends life expectancy by 3 years.</p>
</details>

这对于这些患者的整体生存率来说意义重大，这是这项新技术平台带来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a very big deal for these um uh patients in terms of uh overall survival uh in that new uh platform technology.</p>
</details>

另一个新兴科学领域中全新事物的例子是**寡核苷酸**（Oligonucleotides: 一种短链核酸分子，用于基因治疗）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um another example of something totally new in emerging science is in a field called oligoucleotides.</p>
</details>

您可以将它们视为**RNA**（Ribonucleic Acid: 核糖核酸）表达的“拼写检查”，用于纠正疾病发展的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you have to think of these as a kind of spell check for RNA expression to correct the way uh disease develops and there we may have a new functional cure for a horrible disease hepatitis B um which impacts 250 million people around the world.</p>
</details>

在这个领域，我们可能会为一种可怕的疾病——**乙型肝炎**（Hepatitis B: 一种病毒性肝炎）找到新的功能性治愈方法，这种疾病影响着全球2.5亿人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you have to think of these as a kind of spell check for RNA expression to correct the way uh disease develops and there we may have a new functional cure for a horrible disease hepatitis B um which impacts 250 million people around the world.</p>
</details>

这些都是近期新资产的例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these are examples of new nearterm assets.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您同时涉足疫苗和药物领域，这两个领域是如何相互补充的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You are both in vaccines and in medicines and how do these areas complement each other?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 疫苗从根本上是为了在疾病发生之前进行预防。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, vaccines are there fundamentally uh to prevent disease before it starts.</p>
</details>

在GSK，我们说我们结合科学、技术和人才来领先于疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, at GSK, we say we combine science, tech, and talent to get ahead of disease.</p>
</details>

疫苗技术带来的投资回报是无与伦比的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there is no better return on investment uh than vaccine technology.</p>
</details>

事实上，在医疗保健领域，除了清洁水，它确实是一个非常强大的解决方案，主要用于传染病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, in healthcare perhaps except for clean water, um it's really is, you know, a very powerful uh solution uh mainly in infectious diseases.</p>
</details>

但您谈到令人兴奋的新科学正在涌现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you talk about what's exciting and new science coming through.</p>
</details>

几周前，我在牛津大学与我们的一个合作伙伴一起研究**癌前细胞生物学**（Precancer Cell Biology），这在长期来看，是令人兴奋的科学领域，可以想象癌症疫苗能带来什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A couple of weeks ago, I was in Oxford looking um with some part in a partnership we've uh developed there to look at precancer cell um biology and that is potentially we're really looking on long-term horizons in terms of exciting science here to imagine what cancer vaccines uh could bring.</p>
</details>

当您谈到互补性时，这非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you know that's very uh exciting science when you talk about um uh the complimentarity.</p>
</details>

显然，在药物领域，您更倾向于治疗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously when you're in medicines you tend to be more in the treatment space.</p>
</details>

但这也可以是疾病的早期干预，以改变其病程，因为社会和医疗保健系统花费金钱的地方是住院和病人治疗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but that can also be earlier intervention in disease to change its course because what costs money for society and health care systems is hospitalization and spending on people being sick.</p>
</details>

因此，早期干预非常重要，这可以通过长效药物实现，让人们无需住院。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So intervening earlier um is really important and that can be with long acting medicines that keep people out of hospital and we have lots in our pipeline uh be it in HIV or respiratory that's looking at that too.</p>
</details>

我们在HIV或呼吸道疾病领域的产品线中有很多这样的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So intervening earlier um is really important and that can be with long acting medicines that keep people out of hospital and we have lots in our pipeline uh be it in HIV or respiratory that's looking at that too.</p>
</details>

### GSK的畅销产品与核心业务

**Nicola Tangan:** 对于不了解GSK的人来说，您最畅销的三种产品是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For the people who don't know GSK what are your three bestselling products?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，我们目前最大的销售额来自HIV、呼吸系统药物和疫苗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well our biggest sellers uh are um in uh HIV in respiratory drugs uh and in uh vaccines today.</p>
</details>

在呼吸系统领域，如果您看一下名为**Trilogy**的药物，它同时用于哮喘和**COPD**（Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: 慢性阻塞性肺疾病）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh in respiratory if you look at a drug called trilogy and that's for both asthma and COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p>
</details>

也许很多人没有听说过它，但它是全球第三大死因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Perhaps many haven't heard of it but it's the third leading cause of death in the world.</p>
</details>

我想有3亿人患有这种疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's the I think 300 million people living with that.</p>
</details>

所以我们有一种日常吸入剂，同时用于COPD和哮喘，名为Trilogy，因为它含有三种药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we have an everyday inhaler for both COPD and a asthma called trilogy because it's got three drugs in it.</p>
</details>

这是一个巨大的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a huge one.</p>
</details>

在HIV领域，我们有两种药物方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In HIV we have two drug regimens.</p>
</details>

请记住，以前HIV诊断曾是死刑宣判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, remember, you know, I an HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence.</p>
</details>

现在，它是一种可以作为慢性病来管理的疾病，因为我们有这些出色的药物，人们可以服用它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it's something that you can uh live with as a chronic disease because we have these fantastic uh drugs that that um uh that people can take and integr have have been pioneering in long acting solutions in HIV.</p>
</details>

我们一直在HIV长效解决方案方面处于领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it's something that you can uh live with as a chronic disease because we have these fantastic uh drugs that that um uh that people can take and integr have have been pioneering in long acting solutions in HIV.</p>
</details>

这意味着每年只需注射六次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that means an injection you can take six times a year.</p>
</details>

我们现在正在研究每年四次，最终目标是每年两次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're now looking at it being four times a year and eventually a couple of times a year.</p>
</details>

这是一个非凡的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's an extraordinary uh uh solution.</p>
</details>

在疫苗方面，我们凭借一种极其有效的**带状疱疹**（Shingles: 由水痘-带状疱疹病毒引起的疾病）疫苗取得了突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in in vaccines, we really pioneered with an incredibly effective shingles vaccine.</p>
</details>

这在今天是一项价值数十亿美元的资产，能提供至少11年90%的保护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a multi-billion asset uh today. Uh gives 90% protection for at least 11 years.</p>
</details>

你知道，我们三人中就有一个人会患上带状疱疹——你的摄影师，你，或者我，我们都会在某个阶段面对带状疱疹，它非常痛苦，而我们有高效的疫苗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, one in three of us. Uh so your camera woman or you or me, we're going to deal with uh shingles um uh at some stage incredibly painful and we have a highly effective vaccines there.</p>
</details>

另一个例子是，我们去年推出了全球首个**RSV**（Respiratory Syncytial Virus: 呼吸道合胞病毒）疫苗，目前仍处于全球普及的早期阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then another example would be we had the world's first RSV vaccine uh uh that we launched last year still only in its very early stage of of global penetration.</p>
</details>

所以这些是目前的大产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So those are the big ones today.</p>
</details>

但对于未来，我认为我们将越来越多地关注癌症药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But for the future, I think we're looking more and more towards cancer uh drugs as well.</p>
</details>

### 研发策略的重大变革

**Nicola Tangan:** 自您担任首席执行官以来，您似乎对研发方法进行了重大改革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've kind of overseen a major overhaul of your R&D uh approach since you became the CEO.</p>
</details>

那么，您对这个过程做出了哪些最大的改变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what are the biggest changes you made to that process?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，我认为这个过程总是在不断进行中，因为正如我一开始所说，我们公司的宗旨是创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think these this process is always uh uh ongoing because as I said at the beginning, you know, the purpose of our company is to innovate and we're one of the only industries that has to literally replace itself every decade um because of the patent model um which is in place.</p>
</details>

我们是少数几个每十年都必须彻底更新自己的行业之一，这是因为现有的**专利模式**（Patent Model: 保护创新药物的知识产权制度）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think these this process is always uh uh ongoing because as I said at the beginning, you know, the purpose of our company is to innovate and we're one of the only industries that has to literally replace itself every decade um because of the patent model um which is in place.</p>
</details>

首先要做的就是明确表示我们要优先考虑研发，并组织起来，优先将资本分配给研发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know the first thing to do was simply to say we want to prioritize it and put really uh organize ourselves to prioritize the allocation of capital to R&D.</p>
</details>

我们对我们想要进入的关键疾病领域进行了彻底的改革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had um a radical overhaul of the key uh disease areas that we wanted to go into.</p>
</details>

因此，我们明确表示，我们将优先发展专业药物和疫苗组合中的关键治疗领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we explicitly said we're going to prioritize specialty medicines and uh vaccines within the port uh portfolio and within that are key therapy areas.</p>
</details>

我们通过业务发展、收购、许可和自主创新，大力投入癌症领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We bet back big in cancer both through business development um acquisitions in licensing and homegrown innovation as well.</p>
</details>

我很高兴看到这项业务去年增长了一倍多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been really excited to see that business more than double last year.</p>
</details>

它仍在发展中，但我想当我们展望即将到来的产品线时，无论是我们希望今年获得批准的多发性骨髓瘤药物，还是全新的**抗体药物偶联物**（ADCs: Antibody-Drug Conjugates）组合，我们认为这将为新的癌症领域提供解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is still emerging but I think when we look forward to the pipeline that's coming next um uh be it the multiple myoma approval we hope to get this year or a whole new portfolio of uh ADCs these antibbody uh body drug conjugates which we think will open up solutions to new areas of cancer I mean this is as you know and you very kindly brought um you very kindly brought forward this recording because I'm going from this meeting to the funeral of a friend who died of pancreatic cancer.</p>
</details>

你知道，你非常友善地提前了这次录音，因为我将从这次会议直接去参加一位朋友的葬礼，她死于胰腺癌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean this is as you know and you very kindly brought um you very kindly brought forward this recording because I'm going from this meeting to the funeral of a friend who died of pancreatic cancer.</p>
</details>

她五十出头，是三个孩子的母亲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She was in her early 50s, mom of three.</p>
</details>

我们越来越多地看到年轻人被诊断出患有癌症。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More and more we're seeing uh diagnosis in younger people um uh uh for cancer.</p>
</details>

尽管科学在这里发展得如此之快，出现了新的治疗方式，但我们仍然面临肺癌等疾病，即使是全球最强大的药物也只对20%的人群有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And although the science is advancing so fast here uh with new uh modalities, we've still got diseases like lung cancer where even the biggest drugs in the world are only effective on 20% of of the population.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为还有很多工作要做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um I think you know there's a lot lot more work uh to do there.</p>
</details>

这是我们产品组合中的一个领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's one of our areas of our portfolio.</p>
</details>

另一个正在给研发、我们行业乃至整个医疗保健行业带来巨大变革的是技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other incredible transformation that is coming to R&D and our industry and frankly the healthcare industry writ large is what's going to be done with technology.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 没错。您还是微软的董事会成员，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. And that's and you are and you are on the board of Microsoft correct privilege that that is and have been for six years.</p>
</details>

您已经担任了六年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've been for six years.</p>
</details>

您从微软那里学到了什么并将其应用到您的流程中？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are you taking from Microsoft into the processes?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，首先，我重申一下，我的核心职责和责任是作为GSK的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, um, just to reiterate, obviously my core job in accountability is as the CEO of GSK.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 但我的意思是，通常当人们在董事会任职时，我有点怀疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I mean I mean, normally I I'm a bit skeptical when people are on on boards, right?</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 这非常有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is hugely useful.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，正是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, exactly.</p>
</details>

所以在这里你可以看到，它应该真正让你能够引入新技术，保持绝对的尖端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here you can just see it, right? It should really enable you to bring in new technologies and be totally cutting edge.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 我相信我们都应该在微软的董事会任职。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I believe we should all be on the board of Microsoft.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 我也希望如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wish I wish I were.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 我很乐意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would love to.</p>

### AI与技术在医药研发中的应用

**Emma Walmsley:** 首先，交叉领域非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">F first of all uh it's very interesting the uh crossovers what are what are just let's just before you get into the obvious relevance of the fact that technology AI now gen AI are going to change every industry and society and it's the most exciting time we can possibly imagine especially when you consider a third of the world's data is related to healthcare and healthcare is one of the biggest challenges in terms of its sustainability its affordability and the enormous amount of unmet need there is out there when you think about aging populations and the rest in fact there isn't a single tech company that doesn't think that the best case study for the the possibilities of technology and its positive contribution to society is healthcare writ large what is most exciting for GSK is our biggest challenge is the productivity of R&D it is really really hard to uh discuss cover and develop a drug.</p>
</details>

在谈到技术、AI以及现在的生成式AI将改变每个行业和社会这一显而易见的相关性之前，我们正处于一个我们能想象到的最激动人心的时代，特别是当你考虑到全球三分之一的数据与医疗保健相关时。

通过能够进行更精确的患者**表型分析**（Phenotyping: 对患者的临床特征进行分类），我们能够设计临床试验，以显示对较小患者群体的巨大影响，而不是所有患者，这样你就可以达到我们所说的功能性治愈，即人们可以更正常地生活。

<p class="english-text">Another would be when you look at the biomarkers around um different cancer types.</p>

在结直肠癌中，我们从子宫内膜癌的经验中了解到，我们观察了一个特定的基因标记，称为**DMMR**（Deficient Mismatch Repair: 错配修复缺陷，一种与癌症相关的基因标记），这使我们能够更精确地靶向癌症，然后在早期阶段的试验中取得了100%的成功率，这使我们能够进入高风险的三期试验。

<details>

<p class="english-text">let's remember vaccines by definition are being given to healthy children or adults it is preventative care so you wake up in the morning you're I I can remember I'm I'm a mom of four I remember taking my brand new babies by the which were born in I have experience of three different countries of giving giving birth and you have different vaccine policies or it felt like you did and you have these questions I've got this precious newborn what is this what am I giving them what's it mean um and you want to have information then I think obviously we went through the global experience of COVID which engendered um you know huge pressure on the health care systems you know a lot of national protectionism tremendous energy around vaccines and a focus on some brand new technologies that had never been developed in vaccines before and people had questions about that.</p>

嗯，我们的答案一直都是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, our answer is is what it has always been.</p>
</details>

那就是，如果你有责任，就像我们今天通过全球项目和新疫苗产品线为全球40%的儿童接种疫苗一样，你需要认真倾听人们的问题，透明地沟通，以100%致力于质量、安全和对我们产品的信任来支撑一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, which is you start off by saying if you have the responsibility of as we do today, frankly, vaccinating 40% of the world's children through our global programs and a a pipeline of new vaccines, of listening hard to people's questions, communicating transparently, underpinning everything with a 100% commitment to quality and safety and trust in our products.</p>
</details>

记住，大声喊着“相信我们”——坦率地说，作为一家对股东负有责任并必须从中盈利的上市公司，这不是最有效的方式。

我给您举个例子，我们的RSV疫苗，我们现在知道它是一种季节性呼吸道感染。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'll give you the example our RSV vaccine we now know has that's a seasonal um uh respiratory infection.</p>
</details>

我们知道它能提供至少三年的保护，也许会延长到五年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We know we have protection probably it will at least three years maybe it will go up to five.</p>
</details>

而流感显然每年都会变异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So and flu tends to be something that mutates obviously every single year.</p>
</details>

所以，当你提供一种每年或更长时间所需的解决方案时，你需要考虑组合方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know you you have to think about what the combinations would be when you're providing a solution that is required on an annual basis or you know more extended like that.</p>
</details>

所以这有点复杂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's it's a bit more complicated.</p>
</details>

我认为有一些新的技术平台可能会允许更多的组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are new technology platforms that will um allow more combinations potentially.</p>
</details>

所以**mRNA**（Messenger RNA: 信使RNA，一种基因信息载体）是我们和其他公司正在研究的一种。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So mRNA is one that that we and others are are looking at.</p>
</details>

但这里的科学相当复杂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh but the science here is quite complex.</p>
</details>

再说一次，你希望在考虑疗效和反应原性的同时，看看这种组合是否会是一种有效的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and again you want to be in a place where you're looking at both efficacy and reacttogenicity as well to see whether that combination is is is is um is going to be an effective solution.</p>
</details>

但这绝对是即将到来的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But definitely something that's on the horizon.</p>

### 企业文化与领导力

**Nicola Tangan:** 稍微换个话题，您带着彻底改变GSK的使命来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on a bit, you came into uh GSK with a remmit of uh dramatically change.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 是的，改变公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. The company.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

您做出了哪些重大的改变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are what are some of the dramatic changes you've you've done?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，我不知道“重大”这个词是否是我想要用来形容的，但肯定在集团战略、结构、资本配置、资产负债表方面发生了非常显著的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't know whe the dramatic is the word that I'd want to um uh use to describe it, but certainly uh very significant change in uh group strategy, structure, capital allocation, um balance sheet, which was a major challenge when we when we came in, which is part of the reason why we did the de merger of Halen.</p>
</details>

当我们刚来时，资产负债表是一个巨大的挑战，这也是我们对**Haleon**（赫力昂: GSK分拆出来的消费者健康业务公司）进行**脱并**（Demerger: 公司分拆）的部分原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't know whe the dramatic is the word that I'd want to um uh use to describe it, but certainly uh very significant change in uh group strategy, structure, capital allocation, um balance sheet, which was a major challenge when we when we came in, which is part of the reason why we did the de merger of Halen.</p>
</details>

我最初加入时，我的背景是消费品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I'd originally joined. Yeah.</p>
</details>

我从中国搬到伦敦，负责建立GSK的消费品部门，我们经历了两次大规模的全球合资企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean my my background was in consumer goods. I moved from China to London to uh build the consumer division of GSK and we went through two massive global joint ventures.</p>
</details>

首先是与诺华（**Novartis**）的投资组合整合，然后是与辉瑞（**Pfizer**）的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firstly with Novartis' portfolio and integrations frankly uh and then with Fisers and and then you know when I was CEO it became very very obvious that um to me that to solve that that a business that we built up from I don't know four to 10 billion in sales um was never going to be the primary uh recipient of capital allocation and it was sort of locked up division inside GSK that I never got a single question on at quarterly results and so it would be much better to set that business free and I'm delighted to see how brilliantly they're doing with that but also use that to reset the balance sheet and uh uh of GSK and frankly enable this fueling of growth and a step change in growth.</p>
</details>

然后，当我担任首席执行官时，对我来说非常明显的是，要解决这个问题，一个我们从40亿美元发展到100亿美元销售额的业务，永远不会是资本配置的主要接收者，它就像GSK内部一个被锁定的部门，我在季度业绩会议上从未收到过一个关于它的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firstly with Novartis' portfolio and integrations frankly uh and then with Fisers and and then you know when I was CEO it became very very obvious that um to me that to solve that that a business that we built up from I don't know four to 10 billion in sales um was never going to be the primary uh recipient of capital allocation and it was sort of locked up division inside GSK that I never got a single question on at quarterly results and so it would be much better to set that business free and I'm delighted to see how brilliantly they're doing with that but also use that to reset the balance sheet and uh uh of GSK and frankly enable this fueling of growth and a step change in growth.</p>
</details>

所以，最好是让这项业务自由发展，我很高兴看到他们做得如此出色，同时也利用这一点来重置GSK的资产负债表，坦率地说，这促进了增长，实现了增长的质变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firstly with Novartis' portfolio and integrations frankly uh and then with Fisers and and then you know when I was CEO it became very very obvious that um to me that to solve that that a business that we built up from I don't know four to 10 billion in sales um was never going to be the primary uh recipient of capital allocation and it was sort of locked up division inside GSK that I never got a single question on at quarterly results and so it would be much better to set that business free and I'm delighted to see how brilliantly they're doing with that but also use that to reset the balance sheet and uh uh of GSK and frankly enable this fueling of growth and a step change in growth.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您现在在您的变革计划中进展到什么程度了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How far how far are you into the into your change plan now?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，你知道，我很高兴在今年年初第二次上调了我们2031年的展望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well um you know I was really pleased at the beginning of this year to upgrade our 2031 outlook for the second times and that's you know we've added another seven billion to the outlook just in four years.</p>
</details>

这意味着我们仅仅在四年内就为展望增加了70亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That means we'll grow 17 billion this decade in sales which you know when I started we were only just over 20.</p>
</details>

这意味着我们将在本十年内实现170亿美元的销售额增长，而我刚开始时，销售额才刚刚超过200亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That means we'll grow 17 billion this decade in sales which you know when I started we were only just over 20.</p>
</details>

所以，我对进展非常满意，但这项工作永远不会结束，因为正如我所说，在我们的行业中，由于滚动专利，我们每十年都必须重塑自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm really pleased with the prog progress but the work is never ever done um on this because as I said you know in our industry we have to reinvent ourselves every decade because of the rolling patent.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您最大的心态转变是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the biggest what's the biggest mentality change you have?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 哦，这是我最喜欢的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh well this is my favorite question.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 我也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well mine too you see.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 所以，我们应该删除播客的其余部分，从这里开始，因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we should we should delete the rest of this podcast and just start here because it's um I like the way you said mentality by the way because you if you say what was the radical change that I wanted to drive for I think culture is is you know definitely one of the things that we've been uh working hard to change what was the culture or what was the country in the past?</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我喜欢您说“心态”的方式，因为如果您问我想要推动的根本性变革是什么，我认为文化无疑是我们一直在努力改变的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like the way you said mentality by the way because you if you say what was the radical change that I wanted to drive for I think culture is is you know definitely one of the things that we've been uh working hard to change what was the culture or what was the country in the past?</p>
</details>

过去的文化或公司是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what was the culture or what was the country in the past?</p>
</details>

嗯，这是一家以各种形式存在了300多年的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a company that's been around for over 300 years in a whole variety of forms.</p>
</details>

所以，它有着悠久而光荣的历史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so it's got a long and proud history.</p>
</details>

但当我被要求开始时，是为了改变公司的业绩轨迹，同时保留一些长期以来使其非常特别的东西，包括对全球健康的承诺，包括一种深度协作的文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but when I was asked to start it was to change the performance trajectory of the company whilst retaining some things that have made it very special for a long time including a commitment to global health including a deeply collaborative culture.</p>
</details>

因为这是一个合作和意外发现很重要的行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um because this is an industry where partnership and and serendipity um uh matter.</p>
</details>

因为它很困难，而且你知道，它是思想和想法的碰撞，以及创造性的摩擦，可以创造出美好的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um because it's hard and because you know it's the clash of brains and ideas um and creative friction uh that can create uh good things but I think we'd become for all the pride in our purpose to change the course of disease and to provide access to medicines and we'd lost our way in terms of performance edge in terms of looking outside the company.</p>
</details>

但我认为，尽管我们为改变疾病进程和提供药物可及性的宗旨感到自豪，但我们在业绩优势方面，在向公司外部看方面，迷失了方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think we'd become for all the pride in our purpose to change the course of disease and to provide access to medicines and we'd lost our way in terms of performance edge in terms of looking outside the company.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，这在许多大公司都会发生，你会变得高度矩阵化，你认为一天的工作就是开好会议，你不够敏捷，你开始认为所有好的科学都在公司内部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This happens in a lot of big companies by the way that you get heavily matrixed, you spend you think a day at work is doing good meeting and you don't you're not agile enough um and you start to think that all good science is inside whereas so how do you change this?</p>
</details>

那么，你如何改变这一点呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how do you change this?</p>
</details>

首先，你要说这非常重要，并将其作为公司的既定优先事项之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is first of all you say it's really important and you make it one of the stated priorities for the company.</p>
</details>

所以我从一开始就非常积极地表示，我们有三个优先事项：创新、绩效和信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I've been very aggressive since I started to say look we got three priorities which are innovation, performance and trust.</p>
</details>

当然，我们会在我们工作的治疗领域和专业药物及疫苗中确定我们的战略方向，但我们以文化为基础并推动它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um writ large obviously we take our strategic direction in the therapy areas we're going to work in and you know specialty medicines and vaccines but we underpin that and we power that by culture so you say culture is the it's not an HR issue it's not something we write on the wall it is literally the job of the leadership of the company CEO first by the way and I think that is the secret source of everything because when you're running a company of you know in the beginning it was 100 thousand people we're now 70 or so um you you know you can't you you have to set an environment that doesn't need constant oversight or inspection.</p>
</details>

所以你说文化是……它不是一个**HR**（Human Resources: 人力资源）问题，也不是我们写在墙上的东西，它实际上是公司领导层的工作，顺便说一句，首席执行官是第一位的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you say culture is the it's not an HR issue it's not something we write on the wall it is literally the job of the leadership of the company CEO first by the way and I think that is the secret source of everything because when you're running a company of you know in the beginning it was 100 thousand people we're now 70 or so um you you know you can't you you have to set an environment that doesn't need constant oversight or inspection.</p>
</details>

我认为这就是一切的秘诀，因为当你管理一家公司时，你知道，一开始是10万人，现在大约7万人，你不能……你必须创造一个不需要持续监督或检查的环境。

<p class="english-text">so you say culture is the it's not an HR issue it's not something we write on the wall it is literally the job of the leadership of the company CEO first by the way and I think that is the secret source of everything because when you're running a company of you know in the beginning it was 100 thousand people we're now 70 or so um you you know you can't you you have to set an environment that doesn't need constant oversight or inspection.</p>
</details>

这只是我们的工作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just the way we work.</p>
</details>

所以我们花了很多时间在领导层层面定义我们想要的文化，我们说了三件简单的事情：对患者有抱负，因为这是所有事情的重点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we we we spent a lot of time defining what we wanted that culture to be at a leadership level and we say three simple things. Ambitious for patients because that's the point of everything.</p>
</details>

其中包含抱负的概念，即更好更快地交付重要成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's a notion of ambition in there which is delivering what matters better and faster.</p>
</details>

对我们的影响负责，这关乎结果而非过程，我们需要改变这种有点像政府部门做事的方式，更多地强调个人责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh accountable for our impact and that is about results not process which we needed to shift being a bit government department in the way we do things a lot more individual accountability um but in the spirit of uh um clear ownership and I think that's what sometimes goes wrong in collaborative organizations is that there's a bit too much by committee I'm a big believer in single point accountable decision-making so clear ownership and a positive mindset of support to succeed and then doing the right Absolutely.</p>
</details>

但本着明确所有权的精神，我认为在协作组织中，有时问题在于委员会决策过多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in the spirit of uh um clear ownership and I think that's what sometimes goes wrong in collaborative organizations is that there's a bit too much by committee I'm a big believer in single point accountable decision-making so clear ownership and a positive mindset of support to succeed and then doing the right Absolutely.</p>

我非常相信单点负责的决策，所以要明确所有权，并以积极的心态支持成功，然后做正确的事情。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is all very good.</p>

这是您所说的，也是您的领导团队所说的。

<details>

但您如何将其贯彻下去？

</details>

你定义它，你刚刚也说了。

</details>

我花了很多时间研究继任计划。

<p class="english-text">I spent a lot of time looking at succession planning.</p>

你提倡它，也因此解雇人。

<details>

顺便说一句，你还需要记住另一件事：如果你在招聘，如果你看看你的员工队伍，如果其中三分之一是在过去三年内新加入的，不要以为你在上次全体会议上说的话已经被听到了。

我可以在说“谢谢”和“做得好”方面做得更好，因为我有一个习惯，我相信这深深植根于我的童年，就是总是向上看，看我们还有多少事情要做，而不是偶尔享受一下眼前的风景。

**Nicola Tangan:** 但您说过，我在某个地方听您说过，您需要有非常坚韧的皮肤，才能作为首席执行官生存下来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But um you said um I heard um somewhere you said that you need to have a really hard skin, a tough skin to survive as a CEO.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，我认为，是的，我认为没有什么比首席执行官说他们生活艰难更令人讨厌的了，因为这是一种疯狂的特权和机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think yeah, I think there's nothing more obnoxious than CEOs saying they have a hard life because it's like it's an insane um privilege and opportunity and especially at this time in the world which is you know volatile and uncertain as we all here and and know but it is extremely exciting and science and tech are advancing and there's just so much talent out there with um ambition and creativity.</p>
</details>

尤其是在这个动荡不安、充满不确定性的世界里，正如我们都听到和知道的那样，但它也极其令人兴奋，科学和技术正在进步，有如此多的有抱负和创造力的人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's what kind of things get under your skin.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 听着，我认为像所有人类一样，如果你的组织被事实上不准确的公共报道所干扰，那会很烦人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think like all human beings, if you if your organization is being distracted by public reporting that is factually incorrect, that is annoying.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I think um you know my job is to keep the organization alongside my leadership team because by the way I'm really don't agree with the kind of CEO as superhero notion.</p>

顺便说一句，我真的不认同“首席执行官是超级英雄”的观念。

<p class="english-text">I don't know if you've read it, but it's brilliant.</p>
</details>

绝对非凡，而且在与《**David Copperfield**》（大卫·科波菲尔）的契合度方面非常巧妙。

我偶尔会在健身房锻炼时听一些东西。

<p class="english-text">I listen to things when I'm exercising badly in the gym occasionally.</p>
</details>

我喜欢……我的意思是，我最初是文学专业的学生，所以我喜欢诗歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I'm I love I mean I mean I'm originally a literature student, so I like I like poetry.</p>
</details>

老实说，我没有足够的时间阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't get enough time to read to be honest.</p>
</details>

如果我能有一个……我本来想说一个坏习惯，但这不是一个坏习惯。

<p class="english-text">It's one of the things if I if I could have a I was going to say a bad habit, but it's not a bad habit.</p>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您和**Satya Nadella**（萨蒂亚·纳德拉，微软首席执行官）在诗歌方面有共同之处。

他实际上是我们播客系列中唯一一个读诗或谈论读诗的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's actually the only one we've had on the podcast series who reads poetry or who talks about reading poetry.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，你知道，所以是你们两个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, so it's the two of you.</p>
</details>

所以，我知道我得问他这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I know that I'll have to ask her about it.</p>
</details>

我肯定不能和他谈论板球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I definitely can't talk to him about cricket.</p>
</details>

所以我应该问他那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I should ask him about that.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您早上什么时候起床？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When do you wake up in the morning?</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 很早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Early.</p>
</details>

我是个早起的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm an early morning person.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，因为我经常旅行，我不知道现在是早上还是晚上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, by the way, because I travel so much, I don't know whether it's morning or night.</p>
</details>

我很擅长睡觉，但通常我的闹钟定在五点。

**Nicola Tangan:** 您对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your advice to young people?</p>
</details>

最后一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last question.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 嗯，首先，如果你回答这个问题，我也会回答。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I will answer that question if you answer it.</p>
</details>

我想说三件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would say uh three things.</p>
</details>

首先，不要过多听取老年人的建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, don't listen to the advice of old people too much.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 其次，你知道，当孩子们还小的时候，我们发明了一个家庭座右铭，对我们来说就是……这可能只是我们试图简化父母认为我们应该做的事情，那就是：善良、勇敢、诚实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um second of all, um you know, we we invented a sort of family motto when the kids were little, which for us was be was and this is probably us just trying to shorthand what parents thought we should do, which would was which which was be kind, be brave, and be truthful.</p>
</details>

我仍然坚持这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I still stand by that.</p>
</details>

可能会加上“保持好奇心”，因为我认为我担心当今年轻人所承受的压力，他们似乎都在担心如何规划自己的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">probably add um be curious because I think I think to I worry about the pressure that's on young people today who all seem to be worrying about strategizing their careers.</p>
</details>

我不知道您规划了多少职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know how much strategizing your career did.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 我说一点都没有，简直是零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said none like literally none.</p>
</details>

**Emma Walmsley:** 我认为我大学毕业后所有的工作经验就是做服务员，然后我只是努力工作，做我认为真正有趣的事情，机会就出现了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think my entire work experience was waitressing when I left university and then I just worked really hard at things I thought were really interesting and opportunities arose.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，运气占了很大一部分，但我认为他们给自己施加了太大的压力，他们应该真正地对学习这个激动人心的世界中的一切保持疯狂的好奇心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean like luck was a huge part of it, but I think they put too much pressure on themselves and and and should genuinely be just crazy curious to learn as much as they can in this exciting world at the moment.</p>
</details>

然后我想说的最后一件事是，我认为您播客的标题非常棒，我现在将非常热情地收听所有过去的剧集。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the last thing I would say is I think the title of your podcast, which I'm now going to be very enthusiastic about listening to all the past episodes of, is brilliant.</p>
</details>

因为生活中重要的是你所处的公司（**In Good Company**）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um because what matters in life is the company you keep.</p>
</details>

所以，无论是个人还是职业上，都要与那些能教你很多东西、让你开怀大笑、在你跌倒时帮助你重新站起来、并激励你做得比你想象的更多的不凡之人交往。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So whether it's personally or professionally, hang out with extraordinary people who teach you a lot and make you laugh, uh, help you get up again when you fall over, um, and stretch you to do more than you ever thought you could do.</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 好的，艾玛女爵士，您无疑是一个了不起的人，非常感谢您的到来。

但您呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what about you?</p>
</details>

您必须自己告诉我最后一个答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You got to tell me the last answer yourself.</p>
</details>

您对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>

</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 另一个播客。
