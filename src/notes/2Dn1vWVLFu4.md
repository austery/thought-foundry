### 开场致辞与幽默开场

非常感谢，殿下，哈康王储。非常感谢。我期待稍后与您会面，顺便感谢您个人对气候问题的承诺，这非常重要。感谢挪威银行行长兼主席埃达·瓦尔登博奇和尼古拉·坦根，感谢尼古拉邀请我。我很荣幸来到这里，尤其荣幸能与克里斯蒂娜·拉加德同台。那真是一场精彩的演讲，真的非常出色。克里斯蒂娜，多年来我们已成为非常亲密的朋友，能和您在这里感到非常荣幸。克里斯滕·哈尔沃森，非常感谢，期待在这些发言之后与您进行对话。

<p class="english-text">Thank you very much, your royal highness, crown prince Hulkon. Thank you very much. I look forward to meeting with you later and thank you by the way for your own personal commitment on the climate issue. It's quite important to Eda Waldenbotch the governor and chair of Georgia Bank Nikolai Tangen. Thank you for inviting me Nikolai. I am honored to be here especially it is an honor to share the stage with Christine Lagard. That was a brilliant speech really and truly it was out outstanding and Sher Christine we have become very very close friends over the years and it's an honor to be here with you and Kristen Halverson thank you very much look forward to the conversation after these remarks.</p>

很高兴回到奥斯陆。我在这里待了三天，遇到的朋友们问我的第一个问题就是关于唐纳德·特朗普的。我今天不打算谈论唐纳德·特朗普，但我遇到了一位在美国做生意的挪威商人朋友，我问他如何看待特朗普的政策和决定。他说：“我感觉很好。”他说话的方式让我想起了一个我四十年前听过的故事。我来自田纳西州纳什维尔，那是乡村音乐和**大奥普里**（Grand Ole Opry: 美国著名的乡村音乐表演场地）的故乡。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's a great pleasure to be back here in Oslo. I've been here for three days and one of the first questions I've received from friends that I meet here is about Donald Trump. I don't intend to talk about Donald Trump today, but I met with a friend who is a Norwegian businessman who does business in the United States, and I asked him how he felt about Trump's policies and decisions. And he said, "I feel fine." And there was something about the way he said it that reminded me of a story that I heard actually 40 years ago. I come from Nashville, Tennessee. the home of country music and the Grand Old Opry.</p>
</details>

那时，有一位名叫**卡曾·米妮·珀尔**（Cousin Minnie Pearl: 美国乡村音乐喜剧演员）的喜剧演员，她穿着印花棉布裙，戴着一顶草帽，帽子上还挂着价格标签。她的幽默是质朴的乡村风格。她讲了一个故事：作为一名年轻的国会议员，我在参加了一天的市政厅会议后开车回农场。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And back in those days, they had a comedian named Cousin Mini Pearl who wore a calico dress and a straw hat with the price tag still hanging from the hat. And she she had homespun rural humor. And she told a story. I was driving back to my farm after a day of town hall meetings as a young congressman.</p>
</details>

她讲述了一个农民卷入事故后起诉另一位司机索赔的故事。当另一位司机的律师有机会交叉询问这位农民时，他问道：“难道不是在事故发生后，你立刻就说‘我感觉很好’吗？”农民说：“嗯，没那么简单。你看，我当时正开着卡车把我的牛运到城里，这个人突然从公路中央开了过来。”律师说：“我反对，法官大人。我们不想听冗长复杂的故事。请只回答是或否。事故发生后，你是否立刻说了‘我感觉很好’？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">and she told about a farmer who was involved in an accident and he sued the other driver for damages. And when the other driver's lawyer had the chance to cross-examine this farmer, he said, "Now, isn't it true that immediately after this accident, you said, "I feel fine." And the farmer said, "Well, it's not that simple. You see, I was driving my cow to town in the back of my truck, and this fell came driving across the center of the highway, and the lawyer said, "I object, your honor. We don't want to hear a long involved story. Just answer the question, yes or no. Did you or did you not say immediately after the accident, I feel fine."</p>
</details>

农民说：“嗯，我正要说到那儿。你看，我当时正开着卡车把我的牛运到城里，这个人突然从中央线开了过来，直接撞上了我的卡车，把它撞翻了，把我甩了出去，也把牛甩了出去。我在这边，牛在那边。警察走过来，看了一眼那头牛，说：‘它正在受苦。’然后他掏出枪，一枪打在牛的两眼之间。”

<p class="english-text">Farmer said, "Well, I was leading up to that.

I was on one side and the cow was on the other and the policeman came up and took one look at that cow and said, "She is suffering." Pulled out his gun and shot her right between the eyes.</p>

### 全球可持续转型：关键时刻与政治阻力

毫无疑问，我们正处于全球可持续转型的一个关键时刻，它始终面临着巨大的逆风。但正如拉加德总裁所雄辩地指出的那样，这些逆风变得更加强劲，每个人都知道这一点。在我的投资公司**世代投资管理公司**（Generation Investment Manager: 一家专注于可持续投资的资产管理公司），我们每年都会发布一份可持续发展趋势报告。这是第九年了。我们找不到一个能把所有信息整合在一起的地方，所以我们每年都尝试这样做。我们今年的主要发现是，虽然有一些停滞，但也有一些值得乐观的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there's no doubt that we're at a a critical moment in the global sustainability transition and it's always faced significant headwinds. But as President Lagarde has very eloquently said, those headwinds have become stronger and everybody knows it. At at my investment firm, Generation Investment Manager, we do an annual sustainability trends report. This is the ninth year. We couldn't find any place where it was all put together and so we've tried to do it each year. A and our our key findings this year are that there is some pause but there's also reason for some good feelings.</p>
</details>

十年前，预测是全球气温将升高3.6°C。现在这个数字已经降到了2.7°C。所以我们已经减少了近1%，但这远远不够。自2001年以来，我们或多或少地停滞在这个水平。根据目前的国家政策，预计的气温上升在四年内没有变化。我们都知道原因。存在巨大的政治阻力，使得各国越来越难以通过新政策并提高其气候雄心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know 10 years ago the projections were that we would reach a 3.6° C increase in temperatures. That has now been cut down to 2.7. So we've shaved off nearly 1% but it's not nearly enough. And since 2001 we have more or less stalled out at that level. The estimated temperature rise under current national policies has not moved in four years. And we all know the reasons. There is a huge political push back that has made it harder and harder for countries to adopt new policies and improve their climate ambition.</p>

### 创新、既得利益与化石燃料行业

上周，瑞典诺贝尔委员会颁发了今年的经济学奖给三位杰出的经济学家。一半奖金给了乔尔·莫尔，另一半给了他的两位同事。我认为这值得反思，因为他们因发现的成果而受此殊荣，在我看来，这是近几十年来更具影响力的奖项之一。莫尔几十年来一直坚持一种叙事，他指出创新是经济繁荣和增长的关键。但他的两位同事指出，扼杀创新的因素之一是当强大的既得利益产业，由于害怕创新带来的变化，可能已经积累了过多的政治权力，结果能够阻止创新的引入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, last week the Swedish Nobel Committee award I by the way much prefer the Norwegian Nobel Committee. But the Swedish committee awarded its economics prize this year to three distinguished economists. Half to Joel Moer and half to two of his colleagues. And I think it's worth reflecting because on what they are honored for finding because it's one of the more consequential awards in the last several decades in my opinion. Mocher who has had a narrative throughine for decades makes the point that innovation is the real key to economic prosperity and growth. But his two colleagues have pointed out that one of the factors that stifles innovation is when powerful incumbent industries that have a reason to fear the changes that come with innovation might have gathered too much political power and as a result are able to stop the introduction of innovations.</p>
</details>

化石燃料行业在“俘获”政治家方面，比在“捕获”排放物方面效率高得多。因此，他们利用积累的政治权力来阻挠和削弱世界迫切需要的进展。我们每天仍向**对流层**（Troposphere: 大气层的最低层，地球上所有天气现象都发生在此层）排放1.75亿吨人为的全球变暖污染物。这些污染物不断累积，目前每天额外捕获的热量相当于每24小时有75万枚第一代原子弹在地球表面爆炸所释放的热量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fossil fuel industry is significantly more efficient at capturing politicians than capturing emissions. And as a result, they have used the accumulated political power to push back and to blunt the progress that the world needs very seriously. We are continuing to put 175 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the troposphere every day. And it accumulates to the point where it presently traps as much extra heat each day as would be released by 750,000 first generation atomic bombs exploding on the earth's surface every 24 hours.</p>
</details>

这正在导致水循环的大规模中断，并造成日益恶化的大规模后果。当我们寻求重新启动2021年停滞的进展时，我们也面临着一波右翼民粹主义浪潮，这至少使世界各地的政治变得复杂。我们经历了动荡的几年，俄罗斯对乌克兰的入侵令人痛心，天然气供应中断，正如拉加德总裁所雄辩描述的，还有我们希望尽快忘记的疫情，但它确实在许多方面影响了全球政治。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is causing a massive disruption of the water cycle. it is creating massive consequences that are getting worse by the day. And as we seek to restart the progress that stalled out in 2021, we also confront a wave of right-wing populism that has at best complicated politics around the world. And we have seen a tumultuous few years with the sadistic invasion of Ukraine by Russia, with the interruption of gas supplies, as President Lagarde has eloquently described, the pandemic, which we want to forget quickly, but really royal politics in quite a significant number of ways.</p>
</details>

我们不要忘记，我们仍在应对中国加入**WTO**（World Trade Organization: 世界贸易组织）后出现的超全球化，许多高薪工作离心式地重新分配到世界各地的低工资地区，以及日益加剧的超级不平等，这导致了许多不满，并影响着每个国家的政治。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And lest we forget, we are still coping with the hyper globalization that followed China's admission to the WTO with the centrifugal redistribution of many higher wage jobs to low-wage venues around the world and an increase in hyper inequality that has caused a lot of dissatisfaction that infects the politics of every nation.</p>
</details>

### COP 30、美国的角色与挪威的领导力

因此，缺乏进展是今年如此关键的原因。不到一个月后，世界各国将在巴西举行**COP 30**（Conference of the Parties: 联合国气候变化大会的第30次缔约方会议），即联合国主导的年度国际气候谈判。十年前在巴黎，195个国家同意到2050年实现**净零排放**（Net Zero: 指在特定时期内，通过各种方式抵消所有温室气体排放，使净排放量为零）。只有一个国家退出了。我很不好意思地提醒大家，那就是我的国家。但我也想指出一个重要的数学等式，有些人似乎会周期性地忘记：195减1不等于零。其他国家正在加紧努力，填补这一空白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that lack of progress is why this year is so critical. And in less than a month, the nations of the world will meet in Brazil for COP 30, the annual UNled international climate negotiations. And 10 years ago in Paris, 195 countries agreed to get to net zero by 2050. Only one nation has withdrawn. I'm embarrassed to remind you that it's my nation. But I also want to note a significant mathematical equation that some people seem to forget episodically. 195 minus one does not equal zero. Other nations are stepping up and filling the gap.</p>
</details>

欧盟正在发挥领导作用，而且没有哪个国家像挪威一样提供如此多的真正领导力。不幸的是，特朗普总统的当选使这个问题变得相当复杂，他的行动也影响了一些其他国家，这些国家放慢了自身的进展。但没有其他国家退出。我们正在看到新的国家计划出台。到目前为止，这些计划比实际需要弱得多。这些计划的弱点令人担忧，但并非完全出乎意料，因为如果历史上最大的全球变暖污染物排放国不参与解决这个集体问题，那么这可能会损害其他国家自行解决问题的动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the European European Union is playing a leadership role and no nation is providing as much leadership truly as Norway is providing. Um and unfortunately the election of President Trump has complicated this quite significantly but of course and his actions are influencing some other nations which have slowed down their own progress. But no other nation has withdrawn. We are seeing new national plans come out. So far they are much weaker than they need to be. And the weakness of these plans is worrisome but not entirely surprising because if the largest emitter of global warming pollution in history is not participating in solving this collective problem, then that can damage the motivation of other countries to tackle it themselves.</p>
</details>

但挪威是有望扭转我所认为的短暂倒退趋势的国家之一。在COP 30之前提交新的气候计划，挪威表明行动仍在议程上。当然，细节决定成败。但我想赞扬挪威在帮助发展中国家适应无法再避免的变化方面所做的坚定不移的承诺。事实上，挪威在海外发展援助和其他援助方面的记录确实非常出色。你们通常将超过1%的国民收入用于这些目的。我所知道的没有其他国家能达到这一记录。我的国家接近四分之一百分点。这还是在现任政府开始削减对外援助之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Norway is one of the nations poised to usher in a reversal of what I believe is destined to be a short-lived trend of backsliding. In submitting a new climate plan ahead of COP 30, Norway has indicated that action is still on the agenda. And of course, as always, the devil is in the details. But I want to applaud Norway's robust and ongoing commitment to helping developing nations adapt to the changes that can no longer be avoided. In fact, Norway's track record of overseas development assistance and other aid is truly remarkable. You've routinely committed more than 1% of your national income to these purposes. No other country I'm aware of can match that record. My own country is closer to a quarter of a percentage point. And that's before the current administration started slashing foreign aid.</p>
</details>

挪威已承诺到2026年将其气候融资比2020年增加一倍，并且在过去两年中已经实现了这一目标。挪威还在拯救世界热带雨林方面发挥了坚定的作用，为此贡献了相当于数十亿美元的资金。然而，重要的是要认识到，政府间援助尽管必不可少，但与为能源转型提供资金所需的私人资本相比，仍显得微不足道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Norway has committed to doubling its climate finance by 2026 compared with the 2020 figure and has already achieved this goal for the past two years. Norway has also played a stalwart role in saving helping to save the world's tropical forests contributing the equivalent of many billions of US dollars to that cause. It is important to recognize, however, that government-to-government aid, as essential as it is, pales in comparison to the needed access to private capital in order to finance the energy transition.</p>
</details>

### 私人资本与发展中国家的不平等

过去几年中最有希望和最乐观的趋势之一是，例如去年，如果你看看全球各地所有新安装的发电量，许多人会惊讶地发现，可再生能源所占的比例达到了93%。国际能源署预测，未来几年，这一比例将超过95%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the most hopeful and optimistic trends of the last few years, last year for example, if you look at all of the new electricity generation installed worldwide everywhere in the world, many are surprised to hear that the percentage represented by renewable energy was 93%. And the International Energy Agency has projected that in the years ahead, it's going to exceed 95% renewable energy.</p>
</details>

但是，安装这93%的可再生能源的资金来自哪里呢？85%的资金来自私人资本，只有15%来自政府支持。然而，资本获取存在不平等的分配。经济学家称之为**本土偏好**（Home Bias: 投资者倾向于投资本国资产而非外国资产的现象）。投资者和贷款人也不愿向发展中国家注入资本，因为这些国家存在货币估值突然变化的明显风险，这可能导致他们蒙受损失。当然，他们会担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But where did the money come from to install that 93% renewable energy? 85% of the money came from private capital, only 15% from government to support. However, there is an unequal malistribution of access to capital. There is what the economists call a home bias. And there is also a reluctance on the part of investors and lenders to commit to capital in infusions into developing countries where there is a noticeable risk of currency valuation on a sudden basis which might cause them to lose their money. Of course, they're going to be concerned.</p>
</details>

合同执行的法院可及性、政府的连续性以及某些地区的腐败。所有这些因素都使得发展中国家的利率比挪威或美国高出两到三倍。因此，它们被剥夺了获得资本的权利。以非洲为例。非洲拥有全世界60%的优质太阳能潜力。但非洲安装的太阳能电池板比美国佛罗里达州一个州还要少。这是对当前全球资本分配体系的耻辱性评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Access to courts for the enforcement of contracts, continuity of government, continuity of government, corruption in some areas. All of these factors have raised the interest rates for developing countries two to three times higher than what Norway or the United States would pay. And as a result, they have been deprived of access to capital. Take Africa for example. Africa has 60% of the prime solar energy potential of the entire world. But Africa has fewer solar panels installed than the single US state of Florida. That is a disgraceful commentary on the current system for the allocation of capital around the world.</p>
</details>

发展中国家作为一个整体，在为能源转型和更广泛的可持续发展转型提供资金方面，只获得了极小一部分所需资本。它们获得了43%的新化石燃料开发投资，其中几乎所有都是为了将化石燃料资源从发展中国家出口到富裕国家。我在发展中国家活动家社区的朋友们称之为**化石燃料殖民主义**（Fossil Fuel Colonialism: 指富裕国家通过投资发展中国家的化石燃料开采，以满足自身能源需求，同时将环境和社会成本转嫁给发展中国家，从而形成的一种新形式的剥削）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Developing countries as a whole are getting a tiny share of the capital necessary to finance the energy transition and the larger sustainability transition. They are getting 43% of the new investment in fossil fuel development, virtually all of it for exporting fossil fuel resources from developing countries to the wealthy countries. My friends in the activist community in developing countries call it fossil fuel colonialism.</p>
</details>

当然，尼日利亚等国家所经历的**资源诅咒**（Resource Curse: 指拥有丰富自然资源的国家，反而可能出现经济增长缓慢、政治腐败等负面现象）应该避免，尤其是在我们现在拥有太阳能和风能这两种更优越的可再生能源的情况下。太阳能和风能的成本持续以令人印象深刻的速度下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, the resource curse that countries like Nigeria have experienced is to be avoided, especially now that we have a superior source of energy in renewable energy, both solar and wind. and the cost of solar and wind continue to go down very very impressively.</p>
</details>

### 可再生能源的崛起与中国的角色

正如我所说，挪威在所有这些方面都是一个令人印象深刻的领导者，挪威的电力部门已经是世界上最清洁的之一。挪威98%的电力容量是无碳的，当然你们有很多水力发电，但你们做出了正确的选择，我们正在看到一个拐点，特别是太阳能的成本达到了前所未有的低水平。以巴基斯坦为例。他们正在以创纪录的速度安装廉价的中国太阳能电池板。在巴基斯坦的一些地区，现在新娘的**嫁妆**（Dowy: 嫁妆，在此指新娘家庭提供的财物）包括三块太阳能电池板和一个逆变器已经不罕见。这是一个真实的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this nation has been as I've said a very impressive leader in all of these matters and Norway's power sector is already one of the cleanest in the world. 98% of Norway's electricity capacity is carbonf free and of course you have a lot of hydro power but you've made the right choices and and we are seeing an inflection point as the cost of solar in particular reaches unprecedented low levels. Take Pakistan for example. They are installing cheap Chinese solar panels at a record rate. In some areas of Pakistan, it is now not uncommon for a bride's dowy to be three panels and an inverter. Uh and that's a true story.</p>
</details>

我们看到这在许多国家迅速发展。太阳能电池板的进口量不仅在非洲的发展中国家，而且在东南亚和世界其他地区都增长得非常快。当太阳能电池板与电池结合时，真正的变革就开始了。在我的国家，加利福尼亚电网在傍晚时分20%的电力来自白天用阳光充电的电池。我从澳大利亚飞到这里，南澳大利亚在傍晚时分30%的电力来自电池。他们的目标是达到100%。专家们相信他们肯定会实现这个目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we are seeing this take off in so many countries. Imports of solar panels are rising very quickly not only in the developing countries of Africa but in Southeast Asia and elsewhere in the world. And when solar panels are coupled with batteries, then the transformation really begins to take hold. In my nation, the California grid is getting 20% of its power in the early evening from batteries charged with sunshine earlier in the day. I flew here from Australia and South Australia gets 30% of its power from batteries in the early evening. Their goal is to reach 100%. And the experts believe they definitely will reach that goal.</p>
</details>

继发电之后，化石燃料的第二大市场是交通运输。今年全球电动汽车销量增长了30%以上。到2025年，电动汽车销量很可能占全球汽车总销量的四分之一。挪威再次成为全球领导者。插电式汽车多年来已占据市场90%以上的份额。九月份的数据刚刚公布。挪威所有新车销量中有98.3%是电动汽车。所以我想你们可以打勾了。挪威，非常感谢你们的领导。你们的国家车队已经有三分之一是电动汽车，正朝着100%的目标迈进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the second largest market for fossil fuels after electricity generation is transportation. And worldwide the sales volume of electric cars is up more than 30% this year. Will likely be a quarter of all cars sold worldwide in 2025. And Norway once again is the global leader. Cars with plugs have been nor more than 90% of the market for years already. And the figures for the month of September just came in. 98.3% of all new car sales in Norway are electric. So I think you can check that box. Norway, thank you very much for your leadership. Your national fleet is already one-third electric on its way toward 100%.</p>
</details>

我们其他人现在可以环顾挪威，开始看到一个后石油时代的未来。但太阳能、电池和电动交通的蓬勃发展都伴随着巨大的地缘政治挑战。中国做出的决定使其在所有这些以可持续发展为重点的未来产业中占据主导地位。今年五月，中国每天新增的太阳能发电能力相当于每天开放三座1吉瓦核电站，连续30天。很难想象其他任何国家能做到这一点，而且在所有相关领域，他们都做出了积极行动以主导这些行业的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the rest of us can look around Norway right now and begin to see the start of a post oil future. But there is a huge geopolitical challenge associated with both the solar boom, the battery boom and the electric transportation boom. China has made decisions that have allowed it to dominate the market in all of these sustainability focused industries in the future. During the month of May this year, China installed as much new solar electric capacity every day as would have been provided by opening three 1 gawatt nuclear plants every day, 30 days in a row. It's difficult to imagine any other country accomplishing that and in every one of the related fields they have made an in a decision to move aggressively to dominate those industries.</p>
</details>

所以我们必须应对这个挑战。中国似乎认为他们真的会让21世纪成为中国的世纪，并为全世界提供领导力，也许在地缘政治领域也是如此。我不认为他们能做到。我不认为世界会追随中国，因为总的来说，世界不认同中国的价值观。我们珍视自由，尽管有时它似乎受到攻击。但我也想指出，对中国动机的怀疑很可能在许多方面都是有道理的，包括他们对**北约**（NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization，北大西洋公约组织）国家和更广泛的欧洲国家构成的安全风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we must respond to that challenge. China seems to think that they really will make the 21st century a Chinese century and provide leadership for the entire world perhaps in the geopolitical sphere as well. I don't think they can. I don't think the world will follow China because the world does not generally speaking agree with the values of China. We value freedom even though it seems at times to be under assault. But let me also made make the point that suspicion of Chinese motives might well be warranted on many fronts including the security risks that they pose to NATO countries and European countries more generally.</p>
</details>

中国经济本身距离清洁还有很长的路要走。但我们必须认识到他们在能源转型方面所取得的成就。挪威正在激励世界各国。我们必须应对并管理中国在这些技术方面的主导地位。然而，我们也需要认识到，自巴黎协定以来，世界经济的走向已经明确。希望继续在全球市场竞争的公司，必须将可持续发展作为其业务运营的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Chinese economy is itself a long way from clean. But we have to recognize that what they have accomplished with the energy transition. Norway is inspiring countries around the world. We have to respond and ma to and manage China's dominance of these technologies. And yet we also need to recognize that since Paris, the direction of travel for the world economy has been clear. Companies that want to continue to compete for global markets will have to make sustainability central to their business operations.</p>
</details>

美国没有以应有的方式参与。但我确实相信我的国家也会发生变化。因此，尽管目前存在政治困难，我们不能让对一个更美好世界的雄心在我们这一代人手中消逝。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The United States is not participating in the way that it should. But I do believe that change is coming in my country as well. So despite the political difficulties of the moment, we cannot let the ambition for a better world wither away on our watch.</p>

### 呼吁行动与政治意愿

最后，让我引用挪威著名剧作家亨利克·易卜生的名言。我没有克里斯蒂娜那么勇敢，甚至不敢尝试用挪威语说出来。天哪，克里斯蒂娜。

在一个我们看到各种机构，特别是金融机构，纷纷背离其早期气候承诺的时代，我想起了易卜生的《**营造大师**》（The Master Builder: 亨利克·易卜生创作的戏剧）中的一句话：“空中楼阁，它们是如此容易躲避，也如此容易建造。”但我想提醒我们另一段话，对我来说，它展示了我们共同的任务。来自《**曼登**》（Manden: 亨利克·易卜生作品，此处可能为转述或误记，但按原文保留）。他写道：“千言万语难留痕，一举一动定乾坤。”

<p class="english-text">At a time when we've seen institutions of all kinds, but particularly financial institutions, back away from their earlier climate commitments, I'm reminded of Ipsson's The Master Builder and the quote, "Castles in the air. They are so easy to take refuge in and so easy to build, too." But I'd like to remind us of another passage which to me demonstrates our collective task. from Manden. He wrote, "A thousand words can't make the mark. A single deed will leave."</p>

所以，我们所有人都应该振作起来，忽略批评者，将我们的言语转化为行动，共同守护人类文明的未来。我们拥有一切所需。国际能源署告诉我们，现有技术可以帮助我们实现65%的净零排放目标。成熟的商业模式已经为人所知。我们对另外35%的路径也清晰可见。

<p class="english-text">So, the time has come for all of us to summon our strength and ignore our critics, turn our words into deeds that will collectively safeguard the future of human civilization. We have everything we need. The International Energy Agency tells us the technologies are there for 65% of the way to reducing to net zero. Proven business models are already known. We have clear line of sight to the other 35%.</p>

人类所面临的每一个基于道德的挑战都经历过倡导者感到绝望的时期。废除奴隶制、妇女选举权、结束南非的种族隔离。有时似乎不可能，正如已故的纳尔逊·曼德拉曾经说过的，在完成之前，一切似乎都是不可能的。当争论的枝节被清除，核心问题被揭示为对错的选择时，那么在非常深层面上，结果就已注定。

<p class="english-text">Every morallybased challenge that humanity has faced has gone through periods when the advocates felt despair. the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, ending apartheid in South Africa. It seemed at times impossible, as the late man Nelson Mandela once said, it always seems impossible until it's done. And when the underbrush of argumentation is cleared away and the central issue is revealed to be a choice between right and wrong, then at a very deep level, the outcome becomes forordained.</p>

有些人认为我们唯一缺乏的是政治意愿。但请永远记住，政治意愿本身就是一种可再生资源。谢谢大家。
