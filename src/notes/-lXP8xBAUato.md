### 《鱿鱼游戏》：债务危机下的生存困境

The third season of "Squid Game" ushered in a dark finale, sparking heated discussions among global audiences. Today, SuperY is about to delve into an analysis of the "Squid Game" series.
《鱿鱼游戏》第三季迎来了一个黑暗的结局，在全球观众中引发了热烈讨论。今天，超级歪将带你进入《鱿鱼游戏》系列的哲学解析。

The story of "Squid Game" originated from a male protagonist, Gi-hun, who lived a difficult life, long-term depending on his mother's income and using her money to gamble on horse racing.
《鱿鱼游戏》的故事起源于一个生活窘迫的男主角奇勋，他长期依赖母亲养家糊口，甚至用母亲的钱赌马。

After the protagonist wins a sum of money, he is immediately chased by a debt collection group. In a moment of despair, he is invited to participate in "Squid Game."
主角赢了一笔钱后，立刻被讨债集团追赶。在绝望之际，他受邀参加“鱿鱼游戏”。

"Sir, you can make a lot of money just by playing for a few days. Would you like to give it a try?"
“先生，您只需玩几天就能赚大钱，要不要试试看？”

Upon arriving at the game site, a total of 456 people competed. These people seemed to have very different backgrounds, but in fact, they were all deeply in debt or struggling to survive, hoping to turn their lives around through this game.
到达游戏现场后，共有456人参赛。这些人背景看似迥异，但实际上都是负债累累或生存困难，希望通过这场游戏翻身的人。

No. 107, Kim Mi-ok, owes 540 million won; No. 118, Oh Young-wook, owes 1.12 billion won; No. 322, Jung Min-tae, owes 880 million won.
107号金美玉欠款5.4亿韩元；118号吴永旭欠款11.2亿韩元；322号郑珉泰欠款8.8亿韩元。

By showcasing the common dilemmas of these players, "Squid Game" highlights the severe debt problems in South Korean society.
通过展现这些玩家的共同困境，《鱿鱼游戏》凸显了韩国社会严重的债务问题。

In 2025, South Korea ranks second in the world in household debt, with a ratio of up to 92% of GDP. Many young people cannot even repay loans from their jobs, leading to high suicide rates among them.
2025年，韩国的家庭债务占GDP的比例高达92%，位居世界第二。许多年轻人甚至无法通过工作偿还贷款，导致年轻人自杀率居高不下。

Taiwan's household debt-to-GDP ratio is second only to South Korea's, with many Taiwanese families having to pay large mortgages to buy a house. The debt problem has become a common phenomenon in capitalism today.
台湾的家庭债务占GDP的比例也仅次于韩国，许多台湾家庭不得不支付巨额房贷来购房。债务问题已成为当今资本主义的普遍现象。

### 资本主义的“负债人”：道德与控制

The philosopher Maurizio Lazzarato pointed out that since the 1980s, capitalism has shifted to **financialization** (Financialization: an economic system where financial markets and institutions play an increasing role in the economy). The market is no longer just about producing goods; the system is also maintained by producing "indebted man."
哲学家莫里奇奥·拉扎拉托指出，自1980年代以来，资本主义已转向**金融化**（Financialization: 金融市场和机构在经济中扮演越来越重要角色的经济体系）。市场不再仅仅是生产商品，该体系也通过制造“负债人”来维持。

It lets people apply for credit cards, car loans, mortgages, and loan investments, allowing low-wage people to maintain high consumption, buy cars, and houses.
它让人们申请信用卡、汽车贷款、抵押贷款和贷款投资，使得低薪人群也能维持高消费、购买汽车和房屋。

Once you owe debts, you have a moral responsibility to pay them back. You must work hard to make money and pay off debts to keep your promises.
一旦你负债，你就有了偿还债务的道德责任。你必须努力赚钱，偿还债务以信守承诺。

Debtors who can't pay back are not just facing financial failure; it is a moral failure. Debt (Schulden) and guilt (Schuld) have the same etymology in German.
无法偿还债务的**负债人**（Indebted Man: 莫里奇奥·拉扎拉托提出的概念，指个人生活日益被债务定义）不仅仅是经济上的失败，更是道德上的失败。在德语中，“债务”（Schulden）和“罪责”（Schuld）拥有相同的词源。

This moral discipline makes people feel that they must make themselves valuable and productive individuals, which allows capitalism to control people's future life plans.
这种道德规训让人们觉得必须使自己成为有价值、有生产力的人，这使得资本主义能够控制人们未来的生活计划。

For example, American universities deliberately design high tuition fees that are difficult to pay, letting students owe a lot of debt before they enter the workplace.
例如，美国大学故意设计高昂且难以支付的学费，让学生在进入职场前就背负大量债务。

So that when they go out into society, in order to pay off debts, they will voluntarily become slaves and accept low-paying jobs.
这样一来，当他们步入社会时，为了偿还债务，就会自愿成为奴隶，接受低薪工作。

And in "Squid Game," we also see that many people become debtors and had to participate in this fighting game.
而在《鱿鱼游戏》中，我们也看到许多人因为负债累累，不得不参与这场搏命游戏。

"Now I give you another chance to choose. Will you go back and live the rest of your life like garbage being collected by creditors, or should we seize the last chance we are given?"
“现在我再给你们一次选择的机会。你们是回去像被债主追讨的垃圾一样度过余生，还是抓住我们给予的最后机会？”

### 结构性支配：是自愿还是被迫？

If these players are in debt and have no choice but to agree to join the game, is this voluntary consent really voluntary?
如果这些玩家负债累累，别无选择只能同意加入游戏，这种自愿同意真的是自愿的吗？

Proponents of capitalism believe that capitalism is different from slavery because workers are free to contract with capitalists. No one will force you, and workers are also free to leave their jobs, unlike slaves, who are threatened by force.
资本主义的拥护者认为，资本主义与奴隶制不同，因为工人可以自由地与资本家签订合同。没有人会强迫你，工人也可以自由辞职，不像奴隶那样受到武力威胁。

We see many people shouting to leave, and after the majority of the votes, the owner really let everyone leave. This mode of operation is exactly what the capitalists promise.
我们看到许多人高喊要离开，在多数人投票后，老板也确实让所有人离开了。这种运作模式正是资本家所承诺的。

This mechanism appears to be liberal and democratic; everyone can leave voluntarily.
这种机制看似自由民主，每个人都可以自愿离开。

But after the players return to reality, we see people start receiving debt repayment notices. The main character's mother needs medical expenses due to a serious illness. Migrant workers are owed wages by companies. Some people are also surrounded by debt collection groups.
但玩家回到现实后，我们看到人们开始收到还款通知。男主角的母亲因重病需要医疗费用，外籍劳工被公司拖欠工资，有些人还被讨债集团围堵。

Everyone strives to survive. Finally, they had to voluntarily return to "Squid Game."
每个人都在为生存挣扎。最终，他们不得不“自愿”回到《鱿鱼游戏》。

Here, we see what the philosopher Alex Gourevitch calls **structural domination** (Structural Domination: a concept by Alex Gourevitch, describing how systemic power imbalances compel individuals to act in certain ways).
在这里，我们看到了哲学家亚历克斯·古雷维奇（Alex Gourevitch）所称的**结构性支配**（Structural Domination: 亚历克斯·古雷维奇提出的概念，描述系统性的权力不平衡如何迫使个体采取特定行动）。

In a capitalist society, people seem to have freedom of contract; you can decide whether to join a business or not. But this freedom is not real freedom at all.
在资本社会中，人们看似拥有契约自由，可以决定是否加入一家企业。但这种自由根本不是真正的自由。

Because capital is in the hands of a few, workers must rely on job opportunities provided by their employers to survive.
因为资本掌握在少数人手中，工人必须依赖雇主提供的工作机会才能生存。

This kind of structural domination forces workers to agree to work for the enterprise.
这种结构性支配迫使工人同意为企业工作。

If there were some alternatives to work in society, for example, the government canceled debt or provided universal basic income, these players would not be in debt, basic survival could be maintained, and there would be no need to join "Squid Game" at all.
如果社会上存在一些工作替代方案，例如政府取消债务或提供全民基本收入，这些玩家就不会负债，基本生存就能维持，根本不需要加入《鱿鱼游戏》。

It is because the structural domination of capitalist society has created a group of poor people that people will join the game, making forced obedience seem voluntary.
正是因为资本社会的结构性支配制造了一群穷人，人们才会加入游戏，使得被迫的服从看似自愿。

This brings players back to reality first. The whole story reveals a more important moral: "If you go out anyway, you'll live in hell, damn it. I'm homeless anyway. I have at least hope here. If I go out, I have nothing."
这首先让玩家回到现实。整个故事揭示了一个更重要的道理：“反正出去也活在地狱，他妈的。我反正也是无家可归。我在这里至少还有希望。如果我出去，我什么都没有。”

Real-world capitalism is actually the scarier "Squid Game." Coming back to the game gives you a better chance of turning over.
现实世界的资本主义其实是更可怕的《鱿鱼游戏》。回到游戏反而能给你更好的翻身机会。

### 劳动游戏化：资本主义的诱惑与异化

"All participants are equal in this game. Participants will compete fairly on the same terms. We are the ones who suffer unequal treatment and discrimination from the outside world. This is our last chance to win fair competition."
“所有参与者在这场游戏中都是平等的。参与者将在相同的条件下公平竞争。我们才是遭受外界不平等待遇和歧视的人。这是赢得公平竞争的最后机会。”

What the master said here is actually the promise of capitalism from the beginning: compete through a fair market, and the most capable deserve the most compensation. But such myths are long shattered today.
主人在这里所说的，其实是资本主义从一开始就许下的承诺：通过公平市场竞争，最有能力的人理应获得最多的报酬。但如今，这样的神话早已破灭。

No matter how hard the poor try, they can't turn over. Instead, in "Squid Game," we see the protagonist break through all the way. As you play the game, you get deeper, and the higher the bonus, the higher it accumulates.
穷人再怎么努力，也无法翻身。反而在《鱿鱼游戏》中，我们看到主角一路过关斩将。随着游戏的深入，奖金也越积越高。

Players who were unwilling to participate actually started defending the legitimacy of the game. This points to a key problem with capitalism: why do many workers voluntarily participate in the game of capitalism, still enjoying it?
原本不愿参与的玩家，竟然开始为游戏的合法性辩护。这指出了资本主义的一个关键问题：为什么许多工人自愿参与资本主义的游戏，甚至乐在其中？

"Squid Game" provides us with an answer: because when capitalism turns work into a game competition, you won't feel like you're being enslaved.
《鱿鱼游戏》为我们提供了一个答案：因为当资本主义将工作变成一场游戏竞争时，你不会觉得自己被奴役。

Sociologist Michael Burawoy found that many companies use competitions and rewards to let employees play rush games, **gamify** (Gamification of Labor: applying game-design elements and game principles in work contexts) the work process, and see who performs better.
社会学家迈克尔·布洛维（Michael Burawoy）发现，许多公司通过竞赛和奖励，让员工玩抢时游戏，将工作过程**游戏化**（Gamification of Labor: 在工作环境中应用游戏设计元素和游戏原则），看谁表现得更好。

This can stimulate the fighting spirit of employees, letting them not get bored at work. As long as superiors reward employees with good performance, employees will get a sense of psychological satisfaction and feel like they won the game.
这可以激发员工的斗志，让他们在工作中不觉得无聊。只要上级奖励表现好的员工，员工就会获得心理上的满足感，觉得自己赢得了游戏。

Workers who are unwilling to work will become voluntary obedience and be willing to keep playing, because one cannot play a game at the same time but also question the rules of the game.
原本不愿工作的工人，就会变得自愿服从，并愿意继续玩下去，因为一个人不可能一边玩游戏，一边又质疑游戏的规则。

Although many people had to join a company at first, as the game gets deeper, people will slowly agree with the rules of the game.
虽然许多人一开始是不得不加入公司，但随着游戏的深入，人们会慢慢认同游戏的规则。

They will even tell others to follow the rules of the game that were agreed upon, accusing others of cheating. "Those people took it twice! I saw it!"
他们甚至会告诉别人要遵守大家约定好的游戏规则，指责别人作弊。“那些人拿了两次！我看到了！”

"I forgot that I didn't agree with the game at all." People who want to escape from the game may even be seen as problematic people.
“我忘了我根本不认同这个游戏。”想要逃离游戏的人，甚至可能被视为有问题的人。

"Do you really have the confidence to go back to that kind of life? If you have a way, stand up immediately! Get up and go outside!"
“你真的有信心回到那种生活吗？如果你有办法，立刻站起来！起身到外面去！”

### 阶级斗争的掩盖：内讧与分化

Michael Burawoy believes that gamification of labor has another consequence that benefits employers: it can allow workers to compete with each other and create conflict.
迈克尔·布洛维认为，劳动游戏化还有一个有利于雇主的后果：它可以让工人彼此竞争，制造冲突。

"This is ridiculous! Then you deceive me! Is taking my marbles like words?"
“这太荒谬了！那你欺骗我！拿走我的弹珠算什么话？”

"Squid Game" was designed to be a zero-sum game from the beginning. The more I win alone, it means that others win less. As if it were the personal interest of the worker, it will be detrimental to the collective interests of workers.
《鱿鱼游戏》从一开始就被设计成一个零和游戏。我一个人赢越多，就意味着别人赢越少。仿佛是为了工人个人利益，就会损害工人的集体利益。

The organizers may even obstruct this, provoking infighting. They deliberately give little food, causing disputes, and before the next game starts, get rid of the weaker ones.
主办方甚至会从中作梗，挑拨内讧。他们故意少给食物，引发争执，并在下一场游戏开始前，淘汰掉那些较弱的人。

"It's part of the game."
“这是游戏的一部分。”

There is also the voting process for "Squid Game," deliberately designed to be open instead of a secret ballot. This can create an opposition between the two parties.
《鱿鱼游戏》中还有投票过程，被故意设计成公开而非秘密投票。这可以制造双方的对立。

In the second season, after the male protagonist returns to the game, he finds that the owner changed the game, causing the protagonist's statement to be not trusted by others.
在第二季中，男主角回到游戏后，发现主人改变了游戏，导致男主角的说法不被他人信任。

"You look like you know very well. Everyone believes your nonsense, what should we do now? Are you responsible?"
“你看起来很懂。大家相信你的胡言乱语，现在我们该怎么办？你要负责吗？”

Whenever you see someone breaking the rules of the game, you are punished, there will be a sense of victory, so that people don't realize that they belong to the same class.
每当看到有人破坏游戏规则受到惩罚时，就会产生一种胜利感，以至于人们没有意识到他们属于同一个阶级。

Everyone gets into the game because of the debtor class. Games obscure real social relationships, making people feel like they're playing a different role.
每个人都因为负债阶层而进入游戏。游戏模糊了真实的社会关系，让人觉得自己扮演着不同的角色。

Players who have lost their sense of class fight each other. Even my own childhood sweetheart, mistress, biological flesh and blood—they can all become enemies.
失去阶级意识的玩家们彼此厮杀。即使是自己的青梅竹马、情妇、亲生骨肉，他们都可以成为敌人。

"What are you doing? What do you think? Play games."
“你在做什么？你以为呢？玩游戏。”

### 现实中的游戏化资本主义

This gamified capitalism has long been our reality. Many large companies today use gamification to manage their employees.
这种游戏化的资本主义，早已是我们的现实。如今许多大型企业都用游戏化来管理自己的员工。

For example, Amazon will score delivery people for a limited time; you have to compete with your colleagues to see who ships faster. Uber rewards you through tasks to induce the driver to drive more times. Barclays Bank uses a computerized monitoring system to monitor employees at all times to prevent them from being lazy.
例如，亚马逊会限时给送货员打分，你必须跟同事竞争看谁出货更快。优步通过任务奖励来诱导司机多跑趟数。巴克莱银行则使用电脑监控系统，随时监控员工，防止他们偷懒。

Like "Red Light, Green Light" in "Squid Game," employees are checked by the detection system every time they have passed. Those caught by the detection system will be punished.
就像《鱿鱼游戏》中的“123木头人”一样，员工每次经过都会被侦测系统检查。那些被侦测系统抓到的人就会受到惩罚。

These gamified designs claim to make capitalism more efficient. But game designer **Adrian Hon** (Adrian Hon: a British game designer and writer, known for his work on gamification) found out that the results of the experiment were mixed.
这些游戏化设计声称能让资本主义更有效率。但游戏设计师**艾德里安·洪**（Adrian Hon: 英国游戏设计师和作家，以其在游戏化方面的作品而闻名）发现，实验结果喜忧参半。

Many employees don't find their work fun. On the contrary, "I feel that being forced to do one more thing is more troublesome. I feel like my boss is treating me like a guinea pig experiment. I hate work even more."
许多员工并不觉得工作有趣。相反，“我觉得被迫多做一件事反而更麻烦。我觉得我的老板把我当成小白鼠实验。我更讨厌工作了。”

### 游戏的本质：欲望、贪婪与景观社会

This brings us to the essential question of "Squid Game": what was the purpose of designing these games? On the man in the suit, the person in charge, and the founder, we found different answers.
这把我们带到了《鱿鱼游戏》的本质问题：设计这些游戏的目的是什么？从西装男、负责人和创始人身上，我们找到了不同的答案。

#### 西装男：魔法式自愿主义

At the beginning of the second season, we see the man in the suit in the park scratching cards and offering bread for the poor. He found that most people chose scratch cards, and only one person chose bread.
在第二季的开头，我们看到西装男在公园里给穷人发刮刮卡和面包。他发现大多数人选择了刮刮卡，只有一个人选择了面包。

"I gave you a chance, and it was your choice. I didn't lose these breads; you lost it."
“我给了你机会，那是你的选择。我没有输掉这些面包；是你输掉了。”

This experiment seems to reflect the greed of human nature. But what really stands out is the ideology of capitalism, as if a person's situation is like this, it all depends on one's free will, regardless of the systemic problems in my environment.
这个实验似乎反映了人性的贪婪。但真正突出的是资本主义的意识形态，仿佛一个人的处境之所以如此，都取决于他自己的自由意志，而与我所处的系统性问题无关。

Cultural critic **Mark Fisher** (Mark Fisher: a British cultural theorist and writer, known for his critiques of capitalism and popular culture) called this **magical voluntarism** (Magical Voluntarism: a term coined by Mark Fisher, describing the belief that individual willpower can overcome systemic problems).
文化评论家**马克·费舍尔**（Mark Fisher: 英国文化理论家和作家，以其对资本主义和流行文化的批判而闻名）将这称为**魔法式自愿主义**（Magical Voluntarism: 马克·费舍尔提出的术语，描述了认为个人意志能够克服系统性问题的信念）。

If a person feels depressed and unhappy in the workplace, that is the person who has a problem with the perspective of things. Change your perception is fine; it is not because there is something wrong with the social system.
如果一个人在职场中感到沮丧和不快乐，那是这个人看事情的角度有问题。改变你的看法就好了；这并不是因为社会系统出了问题。

If a person chooses a scratch card and does not succeed in winning the prize, he will starve himself. This is also a matter of individuality. "Who told you to这么 greedy?"
如果一个人选择刮刮卡而没有成功中奖，他就会饿死。这同样是个体的问题。“谁叫你这么贪婪？”

This magical voluntarism places the blame on the individual, confusing "spontaneous humanity" with "humanity distorted by circumstances."
这种魔法式自愿主义将责任归咎于个体，混淆了“自发的人性”与“被境况扭曲的人性”。

The reason why many "Squid Game" contestants keep playing is because you have to pay off your debts; it's not because individuals are too greedy. It proves that the capitalist system is too greedy.
许多《鱿鱼游戏》参赛者之所以继续玩下去，是因为你必须偿还债务；这并不是因为个体太贪婪。它证明了资本主义系统太贪婪。

People are being killed to pay their debts, taking their lives as a price.
人们为了偿还债务而被杀，以生命为代价。

#### 负责人：拉康的欲望理论

And on the person in charge of the game, we see Lacan's theory of desire on his desk. This turns the essence of the game to the question of desire.
而在游戏的负责人身上，我们看到他桌上摆放着拉康的欲望理论。这使得游戏的本质转向了欲望的问题。

**Lacanian psychology** (Lacanian psychology: a school of psychoanalysis based on the work of Jacques Lacan) believes everyone is born into a game, a game called the **Great Other** (The Great Other: a concept in Lacanian psychology, referring to the symbolic order of language, culture, and social rules that pre-exists and shapes the individual).
**拉康心理学**（Lacanian psychology: 基于雅克·拉康著作的精神分析学派）认为，每个人都生来就进入一个游戏，一个被称为**大他者**（The Great Other: 拉康心理学中的概念，指先于个体存在并塑造个体的语言、文化和社会规则的象征秩序）的游戏。

It is the linguistic, social, cultural, and legal rules that were established before I was born. If a person wants to express his desires, you must participate in this game.
它是先于我出生就已建立的语言、社会、文化和法律规则。如果一个人想要表达自己的欲望，就必须参与这个游戏。

But once the rules of the game are accepted, people will feel that their desires have been distorted, because this game was not designed for me at all.
但一旦接受了游戏的规则，人们就会觉得自己的欲望被扭曲了，因为这个游戏根本不是为我设计的。

This sense of alienation of existence is the fundamental situation of human desire. It's like when you meet a bandit, you have to decide whether you want money or your life.
这种存在的异化感是人类欲望的根本处境。这就像你遇到一个土匪，你必须决定你是要钱还是要命。

This may seem like a dilemma, but there is only one choice, because no matter how you choose, you will lose money.
这看似是一个两难的选择，但其实只有一个选择，因为无论你怎么选，你都会失去钱。

In "Squid Game," this dilemma also arises after each game: the player has to decide again if you want money, or if you still want to die.
在《鱿鱼游戏》中，这种两难也出现在每场游戏之后：玩家必须再次决定你是要钱，还是仍然想死。

Players seem to have a choice, but not at all. Because when you choose money, if you keep playing, you will die, and you will not be able to realize your desires.
玩家看似有选择，但根本没有。因为当你选择钱时，如果你继续玩下去，你就会死，你就无法实现你的欲望。

But if you choose to leave alive, no money can satisfy one's desires.
但如果你选择活着离开，没有钱也无法满足自己的欲望。

This highlights the fundamental situation of people in capitalist society: it seems that people can only constantly alienate themselves in order to make money to follow the game, but the more money you make, the more you become alienated from your original desires.
这凸显了资本社会中人们的根本处境：人们似乎只能不断异化自己，为了赚钱而追随游戏，但你赚的钱越多，你就越是与你最初的欲望疏远。

#### 创始人：富人的无聊与景观社会

The richer the person, the less they know what they want. And this is exactly the original intention of the founder to design "Squid Game."
越有钱的人，越不知道自己想要什么。而这正是创始人设计《鱿鱼游戏》的初衷。

"If you have a lot of money, no matter what you buy or use to satisfy your desires, eventually, it becomes boring. That's why we are all together. I thought about it a lot, what exactly should be done? Only then can we have a little fun. The fun? You are for fun? Let's do that?"
“如果你有很多钱，无论你买什么或用什么来满足你的欲望，最终都会变得无聊。这就是为什么我们都在一起。我考虑了很久，到底该怎么做？只有这样我们才能有点乐趣。乐趣？你是为了乐趣？我们这样做？”

Here we hear the confession of the founder. So, the whole "Squid Game" is nothing more than an entertainment pastime enjoyed by wealthy customers who spend money on it.
在这里我们听到了创始人的自白。所以，整个《鱿鱼游戏》无非是富裕客户花钱享受的娱乐消遣。

When capitalism reaches this new stage, it is no longer about producing goods for consumption, because for the rich, only goods can no longer satisfy desires.
当资本主义达到这个新阶段时，它不再是为了消费而生产商品，因为对于富人来说，仅仅商品已经无法满足欲望。

Instead, we turned to what the philosopher Guy Debord called a "**spectacle society**" (Spectacle Society: a concept by Guy Debord, where social relations are mediated by images and appearances, turning life into a passive consumption of spectacles).
相反，我们转向了哲学家居伊·德波（Guy Debord）所称的“**景观社会**”（Spectacle Society: 居伊·德波提出的概念，指社会关系由图像和表象所中介，将生活变成对景观的被动消费）。

Capitalism produces a bunch of landscapes to surround our living spaces: pop-up events, reality shows, inspiring pictures. Even the perimeter of "Squid Game" itself is a kind of landscape.
资本主义生产了一堆景观来包围我们的生活空间：快闪活动、真人秀、励志图片。甚至《鱿鱼游戏》本身的场景也是一种景观。

Even Duolingo uses "Squid Game" as a gimmick. These are landscapes that earn click-through traffic; it is the key to the operation of contemporary capitalism.
甚至多邻国也以《鱿鱼游戏》作为噱头。这些都是赚取点击流量的景观；它是当代资本主义运作的关键。

"I'm serious, although the screen at home is big, but no matter how big the screen is, it is not as good as watching it with your own eyes."
“说真的，虽然家里的屏幕很大，但再大的屏幕也不如亲眼所见。”

The rich regard the suffering of laborers as a spectacle of entertainment. These people who play games are commodities in themselves. What is sold is the landscape of the struggle for survival.
富人将劳动者的苦难视为娱乐的奇观。这些玩游戏的人本身就是商品。被贩卖的是生存挣扎的景观。

"You like horse racing, right? You are horses. Horses at the racetrack."
“你喜欢赛马，对吧？你们是马。赛马场上的马。”

By the end of the first season, the person in charge finally revealed that it turns out that the players of "Squid Game" are not the main body at all. The real body of the game is to be a VIP member who observes and places bets.
到了第一季末，负责人终于揭露，原来《鱿鱼游戏》的玩家根本不是主体。游戏的真正主体是观察和下注的VIP会员。

It's not so much that people are playing games; it's better to say they're being played.
与其说人们在玩游戏，不如说他们是被玩弄的对象。

Compared to the scene of players fighting each other on stage, these VIPs in the audience get along happily.
与舞台上玩家们彼此厮杀的场景相比，台下这些VIP们却其乐融融。

Just as capitalism is monopolized by a few corporations today, these businesses have no competitors. You can stay out of the situation, stand at a distance, and watch employees fight each other.
正如当今资本主义被少数企业垄断一样，这些企业没有竞争对手。你可以置身事外，站在远处，看着员工们彼此竞争。

"Oh my God, it's getting more and more exciting."
“哦，天哪，越来越精彩了。”

On the one hand, it allows workers to compete under more pressure; on the other hand, it allows yourself to avoid competition. Capitalism is such a pathological game.
一方面，它让工人承受更大的压力进行竞争；另一方面，它让自己避免竞争。资本主义就是这样一种病态的游戏。

"Wait a minute, if capitalism has become a pathological game, why do we keep playing?"
“等等，如果资本主义已经成为一个病态的游戏，我们为什么还要继续玩下去？”

### 反抗的第三条路：参与以颠覆

Capitalism promises the masses on the one hand that if you keep playing, you will have a chance to turn around. But "Squid Game" revealed that there is no win-win situation at all.
资本主义一方面向大众承诺，只要你继续玩下去，你就有机会翻身。但《鱿鱼游戏》揭示，根本没有双赢的局面。

The "survival of the fittest" competitive game is to play with people as dogs and horses. The landscape is used as entertainment by the rich, which has resulted in a violation of human nature.
适者生存的竞争游戏，就是把人当成狗马玩弄。景观被富人当作娱乐，这导致了对人性的践踏。

So how should we face this game? "Killing me won't change anything. Someone will take my place. The game will be held tomorrow."
那么我们该如何面对这个游戏呢？“杀了我什么也改变不了。会有人取代我的。游戏明天会继续进行。”

At this moment when the protagonist has a chance for revenge, "Squid Game" exposes fundamental problems in sociology: even if the individual who executes the structure dies, it will still be replaced by other individuals, keeping the structure working. How can we change the structure?
在主角有复仇机会的这一刻，《鱿鱼游戏》揭示了社会学中的根本问题：即使执行结构的个体死了，也会有其他个体取代，让结构继续运作。我们该如何改变这个结构？

Japanese cultural critic **Tsunehiro Uno** (Tsunehiro Uno: a Japanese cultural critic, known for his analysis of anime, manga, and popular culture) discovered that since the 1990s, there is a new **Attack on Elimination mode** (Attack on Elimination mode: a term coined by Tsunehiro Uno, describing a narrative trend where characters must eliminate those around them rather than defeat a singular 'big evil') that is starting to sweep anime and movie stories.
日本文化评论家**宇野常宽**（Tsunehiro Uno: 日本文化评论家，以其对动漫、漫画和流行文化的分析而闻名）发现，自1990年代以来，一种新的**淘汰赛模式**（Attack on Elimination mode: 宇野常宽提出的术语，描述了一种叙事趋势，即角色必须淘汰周围的人，而不是打败单一的“大魔王”）开始席卷动漫和电影故事。

Stories are no longer about working with others to defeat the Great Demon King together. Instead, you must defeat those around you and participate in a **battle royale** (Battle Royale: a genre where many participants fight until only one or a few remain).
故事不再是与他人合作，共同打败大魔王。相反，你必须击败周围的人，参与一场**大逃杀**（Battle Royale: 一种众多参与者互相战斗直至只剩一人或少数人存活的类型）。

The goal of survival in a game is to keep yourself alive. This survivor game reflects a shift in societal values.
游戏中的生存目标是让自己活下去。这种生存游戏反映了社会价值观的转变。

In the past, the passing mode was to defeat a big demon king, which means that society has a clear goal and value proposition. But there is no great demon king in the world of battle royale; instead, all men fight against each other.
过去，闯关模式是打败一个大魔王，这意味着社会有一个明确的目标和价值主张。但大逃杀的世界里没有大魔王，而是所有人彼此厮杀。

There is no longer a clear end goal; the game is designed to make no sense. It reflects that we live in a world where we don't know what to do right.
不再有明确的最终目标；游戏被设计成毫无意义。它反映了我们生活在一个不知所措的世界里。

People's struggle for survival no longer has intrinsic meaning; it is merely entertainment for people to watch plays.
人们为生存而挣扎不再具有内在意义；它仅仅是供人看戏的娱乐。

In "Neon Genesis Evangelion" and "Death Note," we see two ways of responding to this collapse of the value of existence.
在《新世纪福音战士》和《死亡笔记》中，我们看到了两种应对这种存在价值崩溃的方式。

Shinji Ikari doesn't want to drive the EVA; he doesn't want to use violence or join the real game. The result is to act like a weakling, and you will only become a loser.
碇真嗣不想驾驶EVA；他不想使用暴力或加入真实的游戏。结果是表现得像个弱者，你只会成为一个失败者。

Light Yagami believes that reality needs to be changed; you have to find a way to live. You must participate in the game of killing, aiming to be a winner. Only then can you make your worth recognized and become a god of the new world.
夜神月认为现实需要改变；你必须找到一种生活方式。你必须参与杀戮游戏，目标是成为赢家。只有这样，你才能让自己的价值被认可，成为新世界的神。

But the results of "Death Note" are revealed: even if we become people like Light Yagami to fight, in the end, it is impossible to create a new order and stop the battle royale. The world after Light Yagami's death has not changed at all.
但《死亡笔记》的结果揭示：即使我们成为夜神月那样的人去战斗，最终也不可能创造新的秩序，阻止大逃杀。夜神月死后的世界根本没有改变。

This is where our reality lies today: retreat like Shinji, refuse to participate in the real game, it can't stop a player like Light Yagami.
这就是我们今天的现实：像真嗣一样退缩，拒绝参与真实的游戏，它无法阻止像夜神月那样的玩家。

But if you fight like Light Yagami, make yourself a strong man in the system, it can't stop this world of battle royale.
但如果你像夜神月一样战斗，让自己成为系统中的强者，它也无法阻止这个大逃杀的世界。

In this dilemma, "Squid Game" shows us a third possibility: stop the game by participating in the game.
在这种两难中，《鱿鱼游戏》向我们展示了第三种可能性：通过参与游戏来阻止游戏。

"Let me go back to the game. Didn't you ask me to stop the game a second ago? If I go back to the game, the rich people you serve will definitely find it interesting."
“让我回到游戏。你刚才不是叫我阻止游戏吗？如果我回到游戏，你所服务的那些富人肯定会觉得很有趣。”

As the winner of the first season game, not only did the protagonist not fly away with the prize money, instead, he chose to return to the game again.
作为第一季游戏的赢家，男主角不仅没有带着奖金远走高飞，反而选择再次回到游戏。

Privately organize a police force, attempting to raid from the outside. Although this plan was intercepted by the game from the beginning, however, the protagonist still tries to cooperate with other players, planning armed operations.
私下组织了一支警察部队，试图从外部突袭。尽管这个计划从一开始就被游戏截获，然而，男主角仍然试图与其他玩家合作，策划武装行动。

This is not the first time the protagonist has planned a rebellion. Years ago, the protagonist participated in a strike. "My colleagues and I were the same then. Take turns on night shifts to guard the factory. I don't know when the police will break in."
这并非男主角第一次策划反抗。多年前，男主角曾参与罢工。“我和我的同事那时也是一样。轮流上夜班守着工厂。我不知道警察什么时候会闯进来。”

Director **Hwang Dong-hyuk** (Hwang Dong-hyuk: South Korean film director and screenwriter, creator of "Squid Game") once revealed this backstory: the 2009 SsangYong Motors strike in South Korea.
导演**黄东赫**（Hwang Dong-hyuk: 韩国电影导演和编剧，《鱿鱼游戏》的创作者）曾揭示了这个背景故事：2009年韩国双龙汽车罢工事件。

The company went bankrupt due to the financial crisis, announced layoffs of 37% of the workforce, and the employees then launched a 77-day occupation campaign.
该公司因金融危机破产，宣布裁员37%的员工，随后员工发起了长达77天的占领行动。

So the protagonist's counterattack in the game is like launching a strike action. But the difference is, this time the protagonist is familiar with the operation of the game.
所以男主角在游戏中的反击，就像是发起了一场罢工行动。但不同的是，这次男主角熟悉了游戏的运作。

He knows that infighting will occur when the lights are turned off at night, and also knows the moment when soldiers will come in to suppress. Therefore, it is possible to wait for an opportunity to lie in ambush.
他知道夜晚关灯时会发生内讧，也知道士兵何时会进来镇压。因此，可以伺机埋伏。

"Start now! We are going to the headquarters of the masked man! Catch the person who kidnapped us! End the game!"
“现在开始！我们要去蒙面人的总部！抓住绑架我们的人！结束游戏！”

The protagonist is familiar with the rules of the game, able to navigate the system with ease, and knows how to catch the flaws in the game.
男主角熟悉游戏的规则，能够轻松驾驭系统，并知道如何抓住游戏的漏洞。

This armed revolution failed because of hidden stakes, but it points out what sociologist **Pierre Bourdieu** (Pierre Bourdieu: a French sociologist, anthropologist, and philosopher) calls "**illusio**" (Illusio: a concept by Pierre Bourdieu, referring to the collective belief or investment in the stakes and rules of a particular social game or field).
这场武装革命因为隐藏的赌注而失败，但它指出了社会学家**皮埃尔·布尔迪厄**（Pierre Bourdieu: 法国社会学家、人类学家和哲学家）所称的“**幻象**”（Illusio: 皮埃尔·布尔迪厄提出的概念，指对特定社会游戏或场域中赌注和规则的集体信念或投入）。

Various competitions and competitions in human society, in fact, they are all man-made illusions. But the most successful player, the most good player, it happens to be the one who falls into the deepest illusion.
人类社会中的各种竞争和比赛，其实都是人造的幻象。但最成功的玩家、最优秀的玩家，恰恰是那些陷入最深幻象的人。

Those who want to change the game cannot stay out of it. Instead, we need to see the structure of the game, understand how to play this game from practice, and internalize the rules of the game from experience.
那些想要改变游戏的人不能置身事外。相反，我们需要看清游戏的结构，从实践中理解如何玩这个游戏，并从经验中内化游戏的规则。

People who want to change society cannot be independent outside, and it happens to be in the illusion.
想要改变社会的人不能独立于外部，而恰恰身处幻象之中。

In the movie "The Hunger Games," we see people who can change the game, it just so happens to be the player who is most caught up in the illusion of the game.
在电影《饥饿游戏》中，我们看到能够改变游戏的人，恰恰是那个最深陷游戏幻象的玩家。

"Seneka, why do you think we design a winner? If we just want to intimidate the people of the districts, why not randomly select 24 people and execute them all at once? Hope? Hope? Hope is the only thing more powerful than fear."
“塞内卡，你觉得我们为什么要设计一个赢家？如果只是想恐吓各个区的居民，为什么不随机挑选24人，然后一次性全部处决？希望？希望？希望是唯一比恐惧更强大的东西。”

It happens to be because the protagonist knows that the organizers want to take advantage of it. At least one player has the illusion of victory, wanting to create a spectacle of one person stepping on another person's corpse to win.
恰恰是因为主角知道主办方想要利用它。至少有一名玩家拥有胜利的幻象，想要制造一个人踩着另一个人尸体获胜的奇观。

So I deliberately chose the strategy of dying together to challenge the logic of the game, revealing the illusion in front of everyone that there is no hope of witnessing this game.
所以我故意选择了同归于尽的策略，来挑战游戏的逻辑，在所有人面前揭露这个游戏根本没有希望的幻象。

The result was that the organizers had to change the rules of the game. "Pause! Ladies and gentlemen, let's announce the winner of the seventy-fourth edition of The Hunger Games."
结果是主办方不得不改变游戏的规则。“暂停！女士们先生们，让我们宣布第七十四届饥饿游戏的赢家。”

And in "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," the heroine is also familiar with the conductive effect that occurs regularly in games. Only one blow can break through the artificial barrier, destroying the illusion of the game from the inside of the game, letting the end of the illusion reveal a glimmer of light.
而在《饥饿游戏：星火燎原》中，女主角也熟悉游戏中定期出现的导电效应。只需一击就能突破人工屏障，从游戏内部摧毁游戏的幻象，让幻象的终结显露出一线曙光。

The same, at the final level of "Squid Game," the story cleverly arranges the elements of the baby. It symbolizes the inevitable participation of the next generation in the competitive game of reality.
同样，在《鱿鱼游戏》的最终关卡，故事巧妙地安排了婴儿的元素。它象征着下一代不可避免地要参与到现实的竞争游戏中。

The protagonist is finally forced to face a choice between one or the other, but it is no longer the original cost of money or death, and became: continue to be the horse that has been bet, let the next generation live like individuals.
男主角最终被迫面临二选一的抉择，但不再是最初的金钱或死亡的代价，而变成了：继续做那个被押注的马，让下一代活得像个人。

"We are not horses, we are human. Human nature is..."
“我们不是马，我们是人。人性是……”

If the gamers are all horse racers, when the horses are played to death, the game won't go on. It also destroys the entertainment nature of the game from within.
如果玩家都是赛马，当马被玩死时，游戏就不会继续。它也从内部摧毁了游戏的娱乐性质。

The protagonist's actions become a declaration of refusal to continue participating in the game. When reinforcements arrive at the arena from outside, the entire game was terminated.
男主角的行为变成了拒绝继续参与游戏的宣言。当援兵从外部抵达竞技场时，整个游戏被终止。

"Must self-destruct."
“必须自毁。”

The domination of the game is no longer passed on to the next generation. Although the protagonist eventually becomes a loser, but it makes the next generation a winner, ended a sick game.
游戏的支配不再传递给下一代。尽管男主角最终成为了一个失败者，但它让下一代成为了赢家，结束了一场病态的游戏。

"Etc. Is there really an end to the game?"
“等等。游戏真的有终结吗？”
