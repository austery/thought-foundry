title: 生孩子能缓解死亡焦虑吗？中国家庭中的投射与控制：孩子如何替父母承受了创伤？
summary: 本文探讨了中国家庭中常见的“恩情”观念，指出其量化、单向的本质如何让孩子背负亏欠感。文章强调，真正有价值的资源是父母与孩子间非排他性的情感协调。深挖父母如何无意识地将孩子作为工具，投射未整合的自我，或缓解死亡焦虑，导致孩子承受创伤，牺牲自我认同。最终揭示在不健康的家庭关系中，孩子并非单向接受者，而是长期承担父母心理功能的工具。

### 恩情：一种可量化的单向交易？

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。今天的视频，我们试图提出另一个视角来探讨，为什么恩情并不存在？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, I'm Anthony. Welcome to my channel. Today's video, we try to propose another perspective to explore why kindness does not exist?</p>
</details>

在之前的视频中，我们提到许多中国父母习惯于强调他们对孩子的恩情。这体现在为孩子提供一系列资源或资本上，例如送孩子上学、报名各种兴趣班、购买各种有形或无形的产品，或是为孩子付出的工作时间，比如为孩子做饭和做家务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the previous video, we said many Chinese parents are accustomed to emphasizing my kindness to my children. This is reflected in the provision of a series of resources for children or above capital. For example, sending children to school, signed up for various interest classes, purchased various tangible or intangible products, or working time for the children. For example, cooking for children and doing housework.</p>
</details>

这些付出的共同点是它们可量化、排他且守恒。也就是说，一份资本或劳动时间，要么属于父母，要么属于孩子。父母给了孩子一份，自己就少了一份。由于孩子出生后无法工作，也无法创造财富，即使孩子非常努力，也不太可能给父母带来可见的、可计算的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The commonality of these efforts is that they are quantifiable, exclusive and conservative. That is to say, a capital or labor time either belongs to the parents or belongs to the child. Parents gave their children a, I'm missing one. Since a child has been, none of them work and cannot create wealth. Even if the child works very hard, but it is unlikely to give parents a visual, calculated returns.</p>
</details>

因此，孩子会觉得自己一出生就是一个不断膨胀的亏空黑洞，感到越来越羞愧和内疚，觉得自己占用了父母太多的资源。所以，他唯一能回报父母的方式就是通过满足父母的期望，这为父母提供了情感价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the child feels that he has been born, it's a black hole of ever-expanding deficits. He felt increasingly ashamed and guilty, feeling that you are taking up too many of your parents' resources. So the only thing he could offer his parents was by meeting parents' expectations. This provides parents with an emotional value.</p>
</details>

在上一段视频中，我们也提到这种恩情的逻辑是无效的。因为对于一个人心智能力的发展来说，最重要的不是物质资源或身体照料，那只能确保一个人的身体能够存活。然而，仅仅身体的存活，并不意味着一个人的个性真正存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was in the last video. We also mentioned, the logic of this favor is not valid. Because for the development of a person's mental abilities, the most important thing is not the material resources or physical care. That only ensures that a person's body can survive. However, mere physical survival, it does not mean that a person's personality really exists.</p>
</details>

真正重要的资源是父母与孩子之间良好的情感协调。这种协调让孩子学会如何理解他人，如何建立亲密关系。甚至可以说，一个人的全部心智能力，例如自我效能感、读心能力、语言表达能力和情感协调能力，都是在这个熔炉中孕育和锻造的，并且可以滋养一个人的一生。这是最有价值的无形资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Really important resources, good emotional coordination between parents and children. This attunement allows children to learn how to understand others, how to build intimacy. It can even be said, a person's total mental capacity, such as self-efficacy, the ability to read minds, ability to express language and emotional attunement, all are conceived and forged in this furnace. And it can nourish the person throughout his life. This is the most valuable intangible resource.</p>
</details>

这种情感资源，虽然也是父母给予孩子的，但它是非排他且非守恒的，可以相互激发并不断增值。当我爱一个人时，我表达我的爱，我已经感到某种满足。我并没有因为把某种爱给了对方，就觉得自己缺少了爱，反而我觉得自己更被爱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Such an emotional resource, although it is also given by parents to their children, but it is non-exclusive and non-conservative. Can stimulate each other and continuously increase value. When I love someone, I am expressing my love, I already feel a certain satisfaction. I didn't give the other person some kind of love, I feel like I'm missing love. Instead, I feel more loved.</p>
</details>

同样，当我向孩子表达信任和宽容，而孩子因为我的信任表现得更好时，我就会更确定，我的信任是有价值的。因此，好的教育只能建立在两个主体之间的情感互动上，而不是主体对客体进行单向灌输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same, when I express trust and tolerance to my children, and the child performs better because of my trust, then I will be more certain, your trust is valuable. Therefore, good education can only be built on emotional interaction between two subjects, rather than a subject to an object, one-way indoctrination.</p>
</details>

### 情感缺失家庭中的隐性回报与机会成本

到目前为止，我们主要讨论了那种运作良好的亲子关系是如何运作的。这当然是一种理想状态。在许多中国家庭中，这种情感的循环和互动并未建立。所以今天的视频，我们主要讨论在情感互动缺失的家庭中，为什么说恩情并不存在，以及父母从孩子那里获得了哪些隐性回报？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far we have mainly discussed that kind of well-functioning parent-child relationship, how it works. This is of course an ideal state. In many Chinese families, this cycle and interaction of emotions, it was not established. So today's video, we mainly discussed in families where emotional interaction is absent, why is it said that kindness does not exist? as well as what hidden rewards do parents get from their children?</p>
</details>

在视频开始前，我先说一下，我会把这个视频放到“心理学与教育”的列表中。如果你有任何想和我讨论的话题，可以通过我的邮箱预约。那么，我们回到今天的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before the video starts, let me say, I will post this video, put it in the list of "Psychology and Education". if, Do you have any topics you want to discuss with me? You can contact my email to make an appointment. So let's get back to today's topic.</p>
</details>

首先，我们说，在恩情的逻辑中，父母给予孩子的资源通常是可见且可量化的。但实际上，孩子提供给父母的资源也是可量化的。但这种给予，并非孩子主动自觉的给予，而是父母将孩子作为功能性工具，或利用孩子弱势地位进行剥削的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, let’s say, in that logic of kindness, resources for Parents to Give to Children, Usually visual and quantifiable. But in fact, the resources children provide to their parents are also quantifiable. But this kind of giving, it is not something that children give actively and consciously. Rather, parents treat their children as functional tools, or taking advantage of a child's vulnerable position, the result of exploitation.</p>
</details>

当我们把父母从孩子那里获得的量化成金钱时，我们会发现，这个金额可能非常高，其价值远远超出了父母为孩子购买的产品和付出的劳动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we take what parents get from children, quantify into money, we will find, this amount may be very high. Its value, it goes far beyond the products that parents buy for their children, and the labor.</p>
</details>

更重要的是，在功能失调的家庭中，尽管父母强调他们只是单方面付出和牺牲，期望孩子将来回报他们的投资，但实际上，他们从生孩子中获得了许多。而且这种回报实际上很早就开始了。如果他们没有孩子，或者因为疾病导致不育，那么他们确实不需要为孩子花钱和牺牲。这看起来像是节省了一大笔开支。但他们的生活会变得更好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More importantly, in dysfunctional families, although parents emphasized, I just give and sacrifice unilaterally, expecting children to repay their investment in the future. But in fact, they have gained a lot from having children. And this kind of return has actually started a long time ago. If they don't have children, or because of a disease that makes you infertile, so, they really don't need to spend money and sacrifice for their children. Seems like a huge cost saving. But will their lives get better?</p>
</details>

正如我们去年12月15日的视频中提到的关于自我认同的内容，**机会成本**（Opportunity Cost: 指为了得到某种东西而所要放弃的另一种东西的最大价值）的概念告诉我们，在现实生活中，无论是选择职业、买房还是租房，每一个选择都有隐藏的成本。我们需要留意那些未选择的道路可能带来的潜在损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As we mentioned in our December 15th last year, what is said in the video about self-identity, the concept of “opportunity cost” tells us, in real life, whether choosing a career, buying or renting a house, every choice has a hidden cost. We need to be mindful of potential losses from paths not taken.</p>
</details>

对于许多喜欢谈论恩情的父母来说，如果他们没有孩子，他们并不会把钱省下来用于自我发展。恰恰相反，他们将孩子作为唯一项目进行投资的原因，正是因为他们的生命路径很早就受到了限制。如果他们没有孩子，他们会失去更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For many parents who like to talk about kindness, if they don't have children, they won't save the money. Use it to develop yourself. Quite the opposite, the reason why they invest in their children as their only project is, it is precisely because their life paths were restricted early on. If they don't have children, you will lose more.</p>
</details>

从机会成本的角度来看，我们不能说他们对孩子的投入是一种“纯粹的牺牲”，而应该说，那是他们在放弃了生活中其他可能性之后，最不费力的选择。他们对孩子的投资，并没有放弃其他更高价值的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the perspective of opportunity cost, we can't say they are devoted to their children, it's a "pure sacrifice". Rather, it should be said, that's after they gave up other possibilities in life, the least laborious choice. Their investment in their children, no other options of higher value are given up.</p>
</details>

那么，他们从孩子那里获得了哪些隐性好处呢？我认为，首先是孩子无条件的依恋给父母带来的情感体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then they learn from the children, what invisible benefits have been gained? I think, First, there is the unconditional attachment of children. The emotional experience it brings to parents.</p>
</details>

### 孩子无条件的依恋：情感的即时回报

婴儿对父母的依恋是无条件且全然的，甚至可以说是一种情感上的崇拜。当婴儿看着父母时，嘴角上扬，眼睛跟随，用柔和的声音呼唤“爸爸妈妈”，这些行为不仅对孩子的生存很重要，也给父母带来了巨大的愉悦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The baby's attachment to his parents is unconditional and total. It can even be said to be an emotional worship. When babies look at their parents, the corners of the mouth are raised, the eyes follow, call mom and dad in a soft voice, these behaviors are not only important for children's survival, it also brings great pleasure to parents.</p>
</details>

在这个过程中，父母的**催产素**（Oxytocin: 一种由下丘脑分泌的神经肽激素，在社交、亲密关系和母婴结合中发挥重要作用）水平迅速升高，**多巴胺**通路（Dopamine: 一种神经递质，与奖赏、动机和愉悦感相关）被激活。这是一种非常真实的喜悦和亲密感，也是一种及时且持续的情感回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this process, parents' oxytocin levels rise rapidly, dopamine pathways are activated. It's a very real feeling of joy and intimacy. It is also a timely and continuous emotional return.</p>
</details>

我们这样说，并不是要贬低人类拥有的这种美好情感，而是强调，抚养幼小的孩子并回应他们的需求，这不是一种额外的或高尚的恩惠，也不应该被神圣化为某种牺牲和奉献。这是一种人类本能和基本的伦理标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say this, it is not to depreciate what humans have, this beautiful emotion. But emphasizing, raising young children and responding to their needs, this is not an extra or noble favor. Nor should it be sanctified as some kind of sacrifice and dedication. It's a human instinct and basic ethical standards.</p>
</details>

另一方面，如果父母不喂养和照顾孩子，对婴儿的需求完全漠不关心，那是不符合本能和不自然的。他们也将遭受广泛的批评和社会压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the other hand, if a parent does not feed and care for their child, complete indifference to the baby's needs, that's uninstinct and unnatural. And they will also suffer widespread criticism and social pressure.</p>
</details>

因为看到孩子可爱，然后想去照料和喂养，这并不直接等同于爱孩子。我们经常听到父母说，孩子小时候挺可爱的，长大了就难管了，不如小时候可爱。这恰恰说明，孩子曾给予父母巨大的情感价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because I see a child is cute, and then want to care for and feed, this does not directly equate to loving the child. We often hear parents say, the child was quite cute when he was young, it's hard to manage when it grows up. Not as cute as a child. This precisely illustrates, children have given their parents a great deal of emotional value.</p>
</details>

然而，一旦孩子有了自己的意志，开始自主探索世界，学习新事物，当精神需求超越生理层面出现时，有些父母就无法再从照料和喂养孩子中获得满足感了。或者他们可能没有能力让孩子继续依恋自己，所以感到非常失落。然而，对孩子真正的爱，是能够超越暂时和偶然的心情，并能持续稳定地促进孩子的自主性和探索能力。那才是真正值得感恩的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, once the child has his own will, start exploring the world on your own, learn new things, when spiritual needs arise beyond the physical level, some parents can no longer care for and feed their children, get satisfaction. Or they may not have, let children continue to be attached to their own abilities. So I feel very lost. However, the true expression of love for children, it is able to transcend temporary and accidental moods, and can continuously and stably promote children's autonomy and ability to explore. That's something to be truly thankful for.</p>
</details>

### 投射异化的自我：孩子成为创伤的容器

我们说，许多喜欢强调恩情的父母，从孩子那里获得的第二个好处，就是无意识地将孩子作为投射自己异化自我的容器。当父母经历过某些创伤，体验过无力、愤怒和被忽视的感觉时，他不想让这些糟糕的感觉与自己联系在一起，但又无法有效地接纳和整合这些感受。那么，这些负面感受就会变得与你格格不入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We say that many parents who like to express gratitude, the second benefit from children, unconsciously, the child as a container for projecting one's alienated self. When parents go through some trauma, experienced feelings of powerlessness, anger, and neglect, he doesn't want these bad feelings to be associated with himself. But I can't accept it effectively and integrating these feelings. then, These negative feelings will become alien to you.</p>
</details>

正如**温尼科特**（D.W. Winnicott: 英国儿科医生和精神分析学家，以其客体关系理论和“足够好的母亲”概念而闻名）所说，如果婴儿无法在母亲的心智中找到自己，那么他只能找到他的母亲。婴儿只能被迫接受父母的心智，吸收并内化为自我的一部分。但这些内化的东西，最终是异己的、异化的，它无法与自我的其他部分连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As Winnicott said, if the baby cannot be in the mother's mind, find himself, then he can only find his mother. Babies can only be forced to accept their parents' minds, absorb and internalize as part of the self. But these internalized things, ultimately, it is alien, alienated. It cannot be connected to other parts of the self.</p>
</details>

所以当个体长大后，由于异化的自我与真实的自我紧密缠绕、嵌套包裹，导致真正的核心冲突当事人难以察觉。那么，他就无法清晰地分辨自己的真实自我和异化自我是什么。他会无意识地将这些异化的自我投射出去，外化出去，并在他人身上看到这些被抛弃的自我。通过这种外化行为，他感到一种满足感，一种自我统一和整合的感觉。但由于这种满足只是暂时的，那么个体就需要不断地使用**投射性认同**（Projective Identification: 一种心理防御机制，个体将自身不被接受的部分投射到他人身上，并促使他人表现出被投射的特质）。这往往表现为关系中的操控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when the individual grows up, because of the alienated self and the true self, closely intertwined, nesting and wrapping, leading to the real core conflict, it is difficult for the parties involved to realize. then, He cannot clearly distinguish his true self, what are alienated selves? He will unconsciously project these alienated selves, externalize. And see these discarded selves in others. Through this externalized behavior, he felt a sense of satisfaction, feeling of self as unified and integrated. But since this satisfaction is only temporary, then individuals need to constantly use projective identification. This often manifests as manipulation in relationships.</p>
</details>

我们有许多喜欢强调恩情的父母，大家都可以看到这一点。例如，一个在重男轻女氛围中长大的女性，从小受到父母严重的歧视和贬低。所以当她成为母亲后，生了一儿一女，她就会经常对女儿充满挑剔和批判。例如，她嫌弃女儿不够勤快、不够懂事。同时，她又非常溺爱儿子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have many parents who like to emphasize gratitude. Everyone can see this, for example, a woman who grew up in an atmosphere where boys are favored over girls, I have been severely discriminated against and belittled by my parents since I was a child. So when she became a mother, after giving birth to a boy and a girl, she would often full of picky and critical. For example, she dislikes her daughter for not being diligent and sensible enough. At the same time, she dotes on boys very much.</p>
</details>

这种对女儿的厌恶和不满，往往来自于一种莫名的冲动。我们说这是她成长过程中，那种无力、羞耻和被贬低女性形象内化的结果。她认同了自己这个异化的部分，也认同了那些攻击性的声音。但这个异化的自我总是折磨着她，令人难以承受。所以她让女儿成为了这个异化自我的载体，并通过贬低、羞辱和控制这个载体，从而觉得自己是完整的、成功的、美好的。她越是攻击和贬低女儿，就越是说明她的创伤有多严重，她被异化得有多深。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This kind of disgust and dissatisfaction with my daughter, often it comes from an inexplicable impulse. We say this is her growing up, such a powerless, shameful, and the result of internalizing a devalued image of women. She identified with this alienated part of herself. I also agree with those offensive voices. But this alienated self is always tormenting, unbearable. So she asked her daughter, became the carrier of this alienated self. And by degrading, humiliating and controlling this vector, then feel that you are complete, successful, and beautiful. The more she attacked and belittled her daughter, the more it shows how serious her trauma is. How profoundly has she been alienated?</p>
</details>

尽管母亲反复强调，她为女儿付出了多少金钱，付出了多少家务劳动，并将其折算成市场价格。但她从女儿那里获得的，实际上要多得多。例如，女儿作为她创伤经历的容器和宣泄口，常年无偿地倾听母亲的情绪宣泄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Although the mother repeatedly emphasized, how much did you spend on your daughter? How much housework did you put in? and convert it into market price. But what she gained from her daughter, actually, there are many more than these. For example, my daughter, serving as a vessel and outlet for her traumatic experiences. Constantly listening to my mother vent her emotions. A free listener all year round.</p>
</details>

同时，女儿被迫接受了母亲投射的糟糕自我，以自我认同被撕裂为代价，防止母亲的心理结构崩溃。这相当于单方面地长期担任心理分析师的工作。此外，女儿还为母亲提供了身份认同。母亲可以在亲戚、朋友和邻居面前，反复讲述自己付出了多少，通过不断强调“养育之恩”，来塑造一个无私的形象。这种社会角色的确认和认可，是母亲人格结构中非常重要的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at the same time, The daughter was forced to accept the terrible self projected by the mother. At the cost of having one's own self-identity torn apart, prevent the mother's psychological structure from collapsing. This is equivalent to unilateral, long-term work as a psychoanalyst. In addition, the daughter also provides identity for the mother. The mother can be in front of relatives, friends and neighbors, repeatedly telling how much I have paid. By constantly emphasizing the "grace of raising me", to create a selfless image. Confirmation and recognition of this social role, it is a very important part of the mother's personality structure.</p>
</details>

如果没有孩子，她就无法建构自己受害者的身份，也难以获得外界的认可和赞扬。所以当母亲用市场价格来衡量自己的付出时，如果我们把这位母亲从孩子那里获得的利益也采用市场化外包的方式，那将是一笔非常高的成本，而且几乎不可能实现，但它显然远远高于她的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If there are no children, she couldn't construct her own identity as a victim. It is also difficult to gain external recognition and praise. So when the mother uses the market price, to measure your own efforts, if we take this mother, benefits from children, market-oriented outsourcing is also adopted, that would be a very high cost. And it's almost impossible to achieve. But it is obviously far higher than my investment.</p>
</details>

### 缓解死亡焦虑：孩子成为生命延续的工具

一个更常见的情况是，父母无意识地将孩子作为缓解死亡焦虑的工具。这在经历过极端环境的群体中很常见。例如，在中国，许多战争、饥荒和政治运动的幸存者，他们会深刻感受到命运的无常，并对自己的存在随时可能被巨大力量抹去感到严重的焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A more common situation is, parents unconsciously using children as a tool to alleviate death anxiety. Common in groups that have experienced extreme environments. For example, in China, many survivors of war, famine, and political movements, they will deeply feel the impermanence of fate. And for their own existence, may be wiped out by a huge force at any time, feeling severe anxiety.</p>
</details>

为了避免这种赤裸裸的死亡焦虑，个体很容易发展出一种策略，就是麻痹自己，封闭感受，拒绝思考。这会降低自我的独特性，就像抹去自己一样。自然也就不需要担心被他人抹去。这听起来荒谬，但仔细思考却很有道理，而且很常见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In order to avoid this naked anxiety about death, individuals can easily develop a strategy. It's to numb yourself, block out feelings and refuse to think. This reduces the uniqueness of the self. It's like erasing yourself. Naturally, there is no need to worry about being erased by others. This sounds ridiculous. But if you think about it carefully, it makes perfect sense, and common.</p>
</details>

但这毕竟是一种消极的自我保护手段。积极的手段是生孩子。正如**马克思**（Karl Marx: 德国哲学家、经济学家、社会学家，其理论深刻影响了社会科学和政治思想）所说，动物与他的生命活动是直接同一的，动物不把自己同自己的生命活动区别开来，它就是自己的生命活动。人则使自己的生命活动本身成为自己的意志和意识的对象。正是在改造对象世界中，人才真正证明自己是类存在物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but, This is, after all, a passive means of self-protection. The positive means is to have children. As Marx said, the animal and his life activities are directly identical. animal, Not distinguishing oneself from one's own life activities. It is its own life activity. Man makes his life activities themselves, become the object of one's own will and consciousness. It is in the transformation of the object world, talents truly prove themselves to be species beings.</p>
</details>

这句话的意思是，人类如何拓展自己，就是自由自觉地进行创造。这并非为了生存，而是自我表达和自我超越的冲动。人们想在对象上打上自己的烙印，从而在自己创造的对象中直观自身，证明自己的存在是普遍且被认可的，它超越了感性的生与死。例如个人的作品、思想、成就等，这些都是这个人存在于世的痕迹和意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This sentence means that, how humans expand themselves, it is to create freely and consciously. This isn't about survival. It's the impulse of self-expression and self-transcendence. People want to put their own mark on the object. Thus, in the objects you create, intuition itself. Proving his existence, is universal and recognized. It transcends the birth and death of sensibility. Such as personal works, thoughts, achievements, etc. These are all traces and meanings of this person's existence in the world.</p>
</details>

然而，当一个人经历创伤事件时，他可能对体制、机构，对整个社会都深感不信任。通过创造、思考、表达等所有高级路径都失去了信心，转而采取一种最低层次的方式来缓解死亡焦虑，那就是生育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, when a person experiences a traumatic event, he may be dissatisfied with the system, the institution. There is a deep distrust of society as a whole. Through creation, thinking, expression, lose confidence in all advanced paths. Instead, it turned to a lowest level approach, to alleviate death anxiety. It's reproduction.</p>
</details>

他们觉得，自我的延续和拓展是不稳定、不可控的，唯一能控制的就是生孩子。然而，这并不能真正缓解焦虑。因为死亡焦虑的本质并非身体的终结，而是自己精神存在的湮灭，是一个人对自己在世界上的位置毫无痕迹、毫无意义的恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They feel, the continuation and expansion of the self is unstable, uncontrollable. The only thing you can control is having children. However, this doesn't really relieve the anxiety. because, The essence of death anxiety is not the end of the body. It is the annihilation of one's spiritual being. A person's understanding of his or her position in the world. Terror without a trace and without meaning.</p>
</details>

这种精神存在，只有通过主体进行创造和言说，将自己的精神外化为现实的作品，例如写一本书、搭建一个模型、制作一个视频，或者写一篇文章，或者与他人进行真实的情感连接和碰撞，他才感到自己与对方真正看到了彼此。而通过生孩子这种物理方式，并不能自动解决这一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This spiritual existence, only through the subject's creation and speech. Works that externalize one's spirit into reality. For example, writing a book, build a model, or make a video, or write an article, or have real emotional connections and collisions with others. He feels himself and the other, really saw each other. And using the physical method of giving birth to a child, it won't solve all of this automatically.</p>
</details>

因为孩子是另一个人，他总有自己的信念，表现出失控的倾向。一旦孩子逐渐变得不像自己，当事人就会感到自己受到了严重的威胁。所以，试图通过生孩子来缓解死亡焦虑和孤独感，就必然会指向对孩子更多的控制和干预。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the child is another person. He always has his own beliefs. Shows a tendency to lose control. Once the child gradually becomes unlike himself, the parties will feel, I have been seriously threatened. So I tried to have a child, to alleviate anxiety about death and loneliness, it will inevitably points to more control and intervention over children.</p>
</details>

### 结语：孩子并非单向接受者，而是长期承担者

所以，如果我们从金钱投资的角度来看，父母对孩子的投资确实需要很长时间才能获得回报。但从心理学的角度来看，那么孩子回报给父母的，很多时候是即时发生的。甚至孩子无法拒绝。孩子无偿且无意识地承担了父母所缺乏的心理功能，代价是自我的不完整和碎片化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if we look at it from the perspective of money investment, parents' investment in their children, it really takes a long time to get a return. But from a psychological perspective, then the children give back to their parents, many times it happens in time. Even children can't refuse.
