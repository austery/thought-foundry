### 本周市场展望

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场前瞻。朋友们，我们正在直播。今天是周日，距离股市开盘还有14分钟。感谢大家的到来，我们有很多内容要讨论。希望大家周末过得愉快，是时候开启新一周的市场了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market futures. We are live folks. It is Sunday. We've got 14 minutes until once again the stock market opens up. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to discuss. We got a lot to get into. Hope everyone had a good weekend. It's time to open up the markets.</p>
</details>

天啊，这48小时真漫长。我已经有些紧张了，准备好重返市场。上周真是漫长的一周，情绪上起伏不定，不仅是情绪上的波动，还有财务上的起落。但我很兴奋，很高兴能重新投入其中。这将是有趣的一周。希望会是有趣的，我不知道是喜悦的泪水还是幸福的泪水，但总会有一些泪水，我们最终会以某种方式一笑置之。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dude, it's been a long 48 hours. I have got the jitters. I am ready to get back into these markets. It was a long week last week in terms of all the emotionals up and down. little not only the the emotional up and downs, but the uh actual financial up and downs. But I'm excited. I'm excited to get back into it. This is going to be a fun week. Uh hopefully it's going to be well it'll be fun. I don't know if it'll be uh you know tears of joy or tears of happiness, but there's going to be some tears that eventually we'll we'll laugh about in some way.</p>
</details>

本周将有特斯拉和Netflix的财报，所以我们会讨论这个，这将是本周的大事。这正式拉开了大型科技公司财报季的序幕。上周，台积电（TSM）的财报非常出色，虽然不是所有科技公司，但它是公布财报的科技公司之一，还有ASML。此外，所有银行和非必需消费品公司的财报几乎都很好，除了一两家地区性银行。我们稍后会详细讨论，但周五公布财报的其他地区性银行表现也相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we've got Tesla and Netflix earnings. So, we'll talk about that. That's going to be big this week. It officially starts off big tech. last week had a great earnings for for uh well not for tech but for TSM which was one of the tech companies that reported ASML and uh all the banks and consumer discretionary companies pretty much good across the board except a couple of the regionals we'll talk more about that but the other regionals on Friday were pretty good</p>
</details>

所以，本周我们将继续关注科技股财报，从特斯拉和Netflix开始。周五我们将迎来**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者物价指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）数据。政府仍然处于关门状态，所以我不知道CPI的发布流程会是怎样，但除了CPI，我们不会得到任何其他的宏观数据，所以周五的数据将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we're going to continue tech earnings into this week with Tesla and Netflix we got CPI on Friday again the government is still shut down so I don't know what the CPI process is going to look like but we're not going to get any other macro data outside of CPI so that'll be important on Friday</p>
</details>

然后，特朗普和习近平将在10月底、11月初在韩国会面。所以，我想本周你可能会得到更多关于这些谈判将如何进行的最新消息。中国在周末表现得相当友好。我的意思是，他们说了一些你意想不到的话，但他们希望表现出超级敌对的态度，而特朗普在周五的一些评论中也做出了类似的回应。所以我认为我们会得到更多关于谈判的进展或更深入的理解。我们会看到一些财报，以及CPI这一宏观数据，并希望政府关门问题也能有一些谈判进展。我们拭目以待，但希望情况不会太糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and then Trump and Xi are going to be meeting towards the end of October, early November in South Korea. So, uh I think this week you're probably going to get a bit more of an update in terms of what those negotiations are going to look like. China over the weekend pretty friendly. I mean, they said some stuff that you wouldn't think would would uh entail, but they want to be super hostile and Trump kind of reciprocated with some of his comments that he made on Friday as well. So, I think we'll get more negotiations or more understanding of what the negotiations look like. we will get some of these earnings and uh we'll get some macro data with CPI and hopefully a little bit of negotiation for the shutdown. We'll see how that plays out, but hopefully it's not too bad.</p>
</details>

### 三项重要公告

在进入正题之前，我有三件事要宣布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Two announcements logistically and then we'll keep actually three and then uh then we'll get started with everything that we got going on.</p>
</details>

第一，我们正式扩大了AK Media团队，并全职聘用了一位新成员——Cactus Jack。每天在聊天室里的朋友们可能都认识Cactus Jack。他现在是AK Media的全职员工。Cactus Jack基本上就是我们个人的彭博终端。当我说“我们”时，我指的是整个聊天室，因为他为我们提供股市动态和新闻更新的速度和奉献精神非常了不起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number one, and they might not be in the chat right now, but they probably will be in the chat. Market open, market close. Uh, folks, we have officially extended the AK media team and brought someone on fulltime. Cactus Jack. Those of you who are in the chat every day probably recognize Cactus Jack. If you're listening every day, you you probably don't um know who he is because you don't keep up with chat. He is now full-time with AK Media. So, Cactus Jack is essentially our personal Bloomberg terminal. And when I say hour, I mean the entire chat because the level of speed that he has dedicated to getting us updates and news about what's going on in the stock market, every single market, open, market, close has been remarkable.</p>
</details>

一周前，我问他：“兄弟，你为什么每天都这么做？”他说：“我就是喜欢这里，喜欢你建立的社区。”我说：“好吧，你每天免费做这些让我觉得很过意不去。而且我觉得我们不妨把这种关系正式化，既然你反正每天都在这里。”他同意了。所以，Cactus现在正式成为团队的一员。如果你看到Cactus发布的消息，无论是财报、特朗普的推文还是新闻头条，都极有可能是准确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh you know, a week ago, I mean, I've seen him for like two years in the chat. A week ago, I'm just like, "Bro, like why are you doing this every day?" And he was just like, "Wow, I just love being here. I love the community you built." And I'm like, "Okay, well, I feel bad that you're doing this every single day for free. Uh, and I also think we might as well formalize this relationship if you're going to be here anyway." There he is. There's Mr. Cactus Jack. And, uh, he said, "Let's do it." So, Cactus is officially part of the team. If you ever see a post from Cactus, uh, it is most more likely than not accurate, whether it's earnings, Trump tweets, headlines, whatever it is.</p>
</details>

现在他的全职工作就是研究市场，获取最新动态。这真的能帮助我更好地完成我的工作，也就是实时传达所有信息和更新。有一个我可以信赖的可靠来源，确保我们能实时传达所有发生的事情，这非常重要，因为很多人在交易时是根据新闻头条来做决策的。所以，Cactus将全职加入我们。我为他感到非常兴奋，也为团队的进一步扩大感到高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you see him in the chat, think of him as our our personal Bloomberg terminal. At this point, his full-time job now is to just research, get updates on the market. And it it really is going to help me do my job better, which is communicating all the information and finding all the updates in real time. And uh having a trusted source that I can rely on and make sure that we can convey everything that's happening in real time, which, you know, for a lot of people, you make decisions based on the headlines that come up when you're trading. That's really important. And so, Cactus uh will be full-time with us. So, very excited for him and uh excited to expand the team a bit further.</p>
</details>

第二项更新。我告诉过大家，在迈阿密见面会之后，我真的想在2026年更认真地对待见面会，包括策划、后勤、基础设施、安保等等。基本上，举办这些见面会最初只是我脑中的一个有趣想法。这个有趣的想法后来演变成了一个真正的社区建设活动，从纽约的50人到迈阿密的350人。我突然意识到，如果我们要继续做下去，就应该认真地做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second update. So, I told you guys post Miami that I really want to take the meetups more seriously in 2026 in terms of planning, logistics, infrastructure, security, all this stuff. Like basically, it was a fun idea in my head to do these meetups. The fun idea manifested into like a real community building event from 50 people in New York to 350 people in Miami. And it kind of dawned on me that if we're going to do this, we should do this.</p>
</details>

昨天我与一家公关管理机构开了一次会，会议非常成功。我真的很喜欢昨天见到的人。目前还没有确认正式的协议。他们11月会来新泽西，届时我会和他们当面会谈。我做决定很多时候是凭直觉。Cactus Jack就是一个凭直觉的决定，而我的直觉最终是正确的。根据昨天的会议，我对此非常期待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a meeting yesterday with a PRmanagement agency and uh it was a very good meeting. Like it was a it was a one of those meetings where it's like it's clicking on all cylinders and I really like the people that I met yesterday. No confirmed official deal. They're going to be in Jersey in November and then I'm gonna meet them in person. I I make decisions a lot of times based on intuition. Cactus Jack was an intuitive decision and my intuition ended up being right because he immediately was like, "Yes, let's do it." And based on the meeting I had yesterday, uh very very excited for it.</p>
</details>

这次会议最酷的地方在于，这不是某个超级大的管理或艺人经纪公司。而是一个在那家机构工作了10年的人，现在她正在创办自己的公司。这正是我兴奋的原因，因为我不会只是他们管理的其他众多客户中的一员。老实说，我甚至不知道她是否还有其他客户。她五周前才辞职，所以我可能就是她的第一个客户，这意味着她会非常有动力去完成工作，并真正将这件事提升到一个新的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and the cool thing about the meeting I had yesterday is this is not some super super big like management talent agency yada yada. This is one person who spent 10 years working at that agency and now she's starting her own firm. And that's what really got me excited because I would not just be one client that's part of like the cog in the machine of all these other people that the agency manages. I would be like one of honestly I don't even know if she has any other clients. I mean, she literally quit five weeks ago. So, like I think I might be her first client, which means she would be very motivated to get the job done and really take this to the next level.</p>
</details>

我们已经举办了五次见面会：多伦多、波士顿、迈阿密、加利福尼亚和纽约，这表明了需求的存在，但现在我们需要把它结构化。所以我对此非常非常兴奋。如果一切按计划进行，明年一月的第一次活动很可能在纽约举行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the first five meetups we've done Toronto, Boston, Miami, California and New York showed that there is demand for this but now we got to make it structured and so I am very very excited for that. Again, we don't have an official deal yet, but uh I think if we can get that deal done by the end of the year, then the planning of venues across the world is going to get a lot easier. And it'll be pretty cool to make this happen. So, should be fun. Should be very fun. The first location I can I think I've already said this before, but the first location, likely will be New York in January. Likely will be New York. So, um hopefully if all goes as planned, the New York happens in January. And if it does, then I'd be very excited to kick off New York again.</p>
</details>

第三个更新。天啊，是关于Substack的。你们的支持简直太棒了。我想我正在爱上写作。这东西太酷了。我通常周六会休息，不去想股票和市场之类的事情。但我已经开始着手准备下两篇深度分析了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yes, the third update. Dude, the substack. You guys have been absolutely like just it's it's been I think I'm falling in love with writing, dude. Like this thing is cool. I you know, usually I take Saturdays off to like just like not think about stocks and the market and stuff. I already started working on the next two deep dives. I have already started working on the next two deep dives.</p>
</details>

我从来不是一个作家，但真正坐下来，不是说出而是写下你的想法，这个过程虽然有点烦人，有点难，我并不像喜欢说话那样喜欢它。但这是一个新的挑战，而且坦白说，我真的很想拥抱这个挑战。所以，非常非常感谢所有订阅的人。如果你还没订阅，我会把链接放在聊天区。没有付费墙，所以任何想阅读深度分析的人，随时都可以阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've never been a writer, but the the the process of really sitting down with your thoughts and not speaking them, but writing them out, it's annoying. It's hard. I like don't love it as much as I love talking. But it's a new challenge and and quite frankly, I I really am wanting to embrace this challenge. So, deeply deeply appreciate anyone who subscribed. If you didn't, I'll put the link in the chat. There was no payw wall. So for anyone who wants to read the deep dives, you can uh read it whenever you want and whatever future content comes out on the substack, feel free to read it.</p>
</details>

我也在考虑很多其他的想法，比如Palantir的第三季度财报。通常我会为此制作一个视频，我也会继续这样做。但我也想写下我对Palantir财报的看法。Robin Hood也即将发布财报，我也想写下我的想法。就是写作这个过程。真的，这个周末，周六，我在这里准备下两篇深度分析，开始研究和打字，我心想，天啊，我不知道我会这么喜欢它，但其中有些东西我真的非常享受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm thinking of so many other ideas, too, like Palanteer's Q3 earnings. Like usually I make a video on that. I'll continue to make a video on that. But I also would want to write out my thoughts on Palunteers's earnings. Robin Hood has earnings up coming. I want to write out my thoughts on Robin Hood. like just the process of writing. Like literally this weekend, bro, on Saturday, I'm over here getting ready on the next two deep dives and I'm starting to research and type and I'm like, damn, bro. I didn't know I would like it this much, but there's something about it that I really do freaking enjoy.</p>

### 隔夜市场开盘快照

好了，我们还有两分钟开盘，然后有一堆新闻要谈。对于那些没看到的人，股指期货是绿色的。非常期待看到市场如何开盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so we got two minutes and then we got a bunch of headlines. We'll get into those headlines. Futures are green for those that didn't see it. Uh very excited to see how this market opens.</p>
</details>

好了，让我们开始吧。隔夜市场开盘了。Robin Hood 132美元。出现了一根绿色蜡烛图，上涨了2%。它曾一度跌至127美元。不，周五凌晨2点跌到了122美元。Palantir现在是178美元，上涨了约三分之一。特斯拉，我们有一些关于特斯拉的更新要讨论，现在是440.80美元。我们有特斯拉的财报，所以这也很重要。英伟达是绿色的，上涨了约0.8%。标普也是绿色的。AMD也涨了一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get into it. Overnight markets are open hoodie 132. There's a green candle. That's up 2%. Fell all the way down to 127. No, it fell to 122 Friday at 2 am. Palanteer right here at 178. That's green by about a third of a percent. Tesla, we got some updates on Tesla. We got to talk about that. 440.80. Uh, we do have earnings on Tesla, so that's going to matter as well. Nvidia, that's green, up about 08%. S&P, that's green. AMD, that's up a little bit.</p>
</details>

SoFi，26.83美元。好了，SoFi今天上涨了1%。Grab是5.71美元，也是绿色的。谷歌253美元，绿色。Reddit上涨。亚马逊上涨。Meta持平。Salesforce上涨。基本上全线飘绿。PayPal是绿色的。苹果是绿色的。SMCI是绿色的。BMR应该是52美元左右吧？BMR 52.04美元。所以我们在这只股票上也是绿色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SoFi, 2683. All right, we're up 1% of the day on SoFi. Grabby Grab 571, that's green. Google 253, that's green. Reddit, that's up. Amazon, that's up. Meta, that's flat. Salesforce is up. You pretty much got green across the board. PayPal's green. Apple's green. SMCI is green. BMR should be like 52, right? BMR 5204. 5204 for BMR. So, we are green on that as well.</p>
</details>

我不知道Amkor是否在隔夜交易。哦，不。它确实动了，32.30美元。成交量可能很低，但从31美元涨到了32.38美元。黄仁勋（Jensen）今天在他做的一个采访中确实提到了AMC。所以我们会播放那个采访并讨论它。但即使以这个价格，市销率为1.15倍，我认为如果他们能继续执行，还是有上涨空间的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I don't know if Amcore trades overnight. Oh, no. Well, it got to move 3230. It's probably very low volume but up from 31 to 3238. Jensen literally mentioned AMC in an interview that he did today. So we'll we'll play the interview and we'll talk about it. But uh I I I you know even at this price trading at 1.15 time sales I I think there is some upside there if they can keep executing.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达的美国制造里程碑与黄仁勋的愿景

好了，让我们来看一些头条新闻。我想我们从黄仁勋开始。黄仁勋今天早上接受了福克斯的采访。非常棒的采访，说了很多我认为非常重要的事情。英伟达的大新闻是，周五，也就是收盘后，英伟达和台积电宣布，他们有史以来第一次在美国开发出了用于Blackwell芯片的晶圆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right cool. Let's get into some headlines. I think we'll start off with Jensen, dude. Jensen did an interview on Fox this morning. Great interview. Uh said a lot of stuff that I think is really important. The big headline for uh Nvidia is that on Friday, this was after the market closed. I think right when the market close ended, we shared the headline. Uh Nvidia and TSMC have officially developed the wafer for the Blackwell chip in America for the first time ever.</p>
</details>

以下是黄仁勋对此的看法，以及他如何进一步阐述美国半导体的再工业化。

> **主持人：** 当特朗普总统今年早些时候首次宣布关税时，你的公司受到了相当大的冲击。但上周五，你宣布将在美国开始生产AI芯片的晶圆。能告诉我们更多关于你的计划吗？
>
> **黄仁勋：** 是的，上周是历史性的一周。我们首次在美国，在世界上最先进的晶圆厂里，制造出了世界上最先进的AI芯片。所有这一切都始于特朗普总统希望重振美国工业。他的关税是促成此事以我们目前的速度成为可能的推动剂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is what Jensen had to say about that and how he went further into the re-industrialization of America for semiconductors. >> So when President Trump first announced tariffs earlier this year, your company was hit pretty hard. On Friday, though, you announced that you're going to start making the wafers for AI chips in the United States. Can you tell us more about what your plan is? Yeah, this last week was a historic week. Uh we manufactured the most advanced AI chips in the world in the most advanced fab in the world here in America for the first time. Uh all of this started with President Trump wanting to reindustrialize the United States. His terrorist was a pressing uh agent in making this possible at this at the at the speed that we're doing.</p>
</details>

黄仁勋刚刚说，特朗普的关税是促成此事的推动剂。所以，黄仁勋在这里给了特朗普很多赞誉，说关税是我们能够做到这一点的原因。这可能是特朗普想听到的。对他来说，以这种方式保持一致对英伟达的股东是好事。显然，对于美国半导体的再工业化项目，黄仁勋正在引领潮流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen just said his tariffs were a pressing agent in making this happen. So you got Jensen giving Trump a lot of credit right there saying the tariffs are the reason why we're able to do this. That's probably what Trump wants to hear. It's, you know, good for Nvidia shareholders for him kind of staying aligned that way. And obviously for the American re-industrialization project around semiconductors, Jensen is leading the way.</p>
</details>

> **黄仁勋：** 在不到一年的时间里，我们现在正在美国制造用于AI的最先进芯片。这仅仅是个开始。通过与台湾供应链的合作，台积电是美国一个不可思议的战略合作伙伴，将最关键技术领域的制造业带到美国。这只是一个起点，之后，与富士康、Amkor、Spill、纬创以及我们许多其他合作伙伴一起，我们将把整个构建AI基础设施的供应链带回美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now at uh uh just in shortly after less than a year, we're now manufacturing the most advanced chips for AI here in the United States. This is just the beginning of it. Uh with the partnership of the supply chain in Taiwan, TSMC is in incredible partner in a strategic partner for United States and in bringing manufacturing of the most in most critical sector of technology here to to United States. Uh this is just the starting point where after that with Foxcon, Amcor, Spill, uh Wistron, so many of our other partners, we're going to bring the entire</p>
</details>

他提到了Amkor。这是少数几家能在美国进行封装的公司之一，与台积电合作非常紧密。市销率仅为1.15倍。我不知道它是否会成功，但黄仁勋在这些采访中并没有提及太多70亿美元市值的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Amcore mention. We got the Amcore mention. One of the only companies that can do packaging in the United States, works very closely with TSM. Trades at 1.15 time sales. I don't know if it's going to work out, but Jensen's not mentioning that many seven billion dollar companies in these interviews.</p>
</details>

> **黄仁勋：** 我们正处于这场工业革命的开端。思考AI的方式是，为了生产AI，你需要一个工厂。那个工厂需要能源。这是特朗普总统为美国科技产业做的最重要的事情之一，就是认识到能源对于这个产业的增长是必需的。特朗普总统的亲能源倡议使我们能够维持增长。我们正处于这段旅程的最初阶段。在未来十年，我们有数万亿美元的AI基础设施需要建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We're actually at the beginning of this industrial revolution. The way to think about AI is that in order for AI to be produced, you need a factory. That factory takes energy. This is one of the most important things that President Trump did for the technology industry here in the United States is to recognize that energy is necessary for this industry to grow. President Trump's pro-energy initiatives has made it possible for us to sustain our growth. We're about hundred couple hundred billion dollars into this journey. We have trillions of dollars of AI infrastructure to build throughout the next decade. And so this is a just in the very very beginning part of that journey.</p>
</details>

### 关于中国的辩论：黄仁勋 vs. Shyam Sankar

显然，黄仁勋对这场AI革命非常看好。他还能说什么呢？他也是在为自己的公司站台。但英伟达正在用增长来证明这一点，这就是为什么这比不相信更有说服力。然而，有一个支持英伟达可能无法实现那种增长的论点，那就是无法在中国销售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I mean look, you've got Jensen obviously very bullish on this AI revolution. You know what else is he going to say? He's he's also talking his book. But Nvidia is putting up the growth to be able to justify that which is, you know, why it is more believable than not. Now, one argument to support, not the bubble argument, but rather the argument that maybe Nvidia is not going to be able to put up that growth is the lack of selling in China.</p>
</details>

几天前，黄仁勋谈到了中国。显然，他对美国非常看好，他所说的关于就业、制造业的一切都正中特朗普下怀。但这一次，他采取了一种稍微不同的方式，含蓄地批评了英伟达应该能够向中国销售的观点。

> **黄仁勋：** 我们希望能够创造出世界赖以构建的美国技术。嗯，很多AI研究人员都在中国。你知道，中国拥有全球约50%的AI研究人员。我认为，不让那些研究人员在第一性原理上基于美国技术构建AI是一个错误。所以问题在于，你如何平衡在保持领先的同时，确保世界建立在美国的技术堆栈之上。这就是平衡。为了平衡，你需要有细微的差别。目前，我们100%退出了中国市场。所以中国市场占我们业务的0%。我们从95%的市场份额降到了0%。我无法想象任何决策者会认为这是一个好主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what Jensen said a couple days ago uh about China. Obviously, he's super bullish for America, and what he's saying about jobs, manufacturing, all of that is music to Trump's ears. But this was when he took a little bit of a different approach uh implicitly criticizing that Nvidia should be able to sell into China. >> We hope that we could create American technology that the world's built upon. Well, a lot of the AI researchers are in China. You know, China has about 50% of the world's AI researchers. I think it's a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology on first principles. I think that's a mistake. And so the question is how how do you balance winning staying ahead on the other hand ensuring that the world builds on American tech stack that's the balance and in order to balance you have to have nuance. at the moment uh we are 100% out of China and so China is 0% of we went from 95% market share to 0%. and so I can't imagine any policy maker thinking that that's a good idea</p>

现在，Palantir的首席技术官Shyam Sankar周五写了一篇文章，标题是《为什么中国鸽派是错的》。最初的标题是《为什么黄仁勋对中国的看法是错的》。如果你读了这篇文章，它并不是对黄仁勋本人的批评。Shyam在发表文章后澄清了他的想法，说英伟达是一家伟大的美国公司。问题在于，我们正处在一个与中国的关键时刻，如果我们不解决这个问题，也就是创造我们生存所需的一切，首先是半导体，然后是药品，以及不能被外包并破坏美国就业的劳动力。所有这些都非常重要。

<p class="english-text">Now Sham Sanker CTO of Palunteer he wrote an article uh on Friday and the title is why the China dubs are wrong. the original title why it was Jensen Huang is wrong about China. If you read the article? It's not really a critique of Jensen per se. Sham clarified his thoughts after he posted the article saying Nvidia is a great you know American company. It's rather the question of dude this is not a joke like we are in a moment with China that if we don't figure out how to resolve it aka create all of the stuff that we need to we need to create for ourselves to survive which is semiconductors first and foremost pharmaceuticals labor that can't be outsourced and ruin American jobs. All of that stuff is super super important.</p>

### 特朗普对中美贸易的最新表态

今天早上，特朗普谈到了中国以及他对这次谈判的想法。

> **主持人：** 我想知道中国现在在想什么。习近平是否就和平协议的成功向你表示祝贺？
>
> **特朗普：** 嗯，我听说他祝贺了。有一份声明发布了。
>
> **主持人：** 因为在他与你会晤期间，他通过收紧稀土矿产的出口管制来挤压美国。
>
> **特朗普：** 他确实这么做了，而我在他们已经支付的关税基础上，将我们的关税提高到了100%，这要糟糕得多。我们会看看中国会发生什么。你知道，我一直和他们关系很好，但他们总是在寻找优势。

<p class="english-text">Here was Trump this morning about China and what he's thinking going into this negotiation. >> I'm wondering what China is thinking right now. Did Xi Jinping congratulate you about the success of the peace deal? >> Well, I heard he did. There was a statement put out, but >> because in the middle of >> a meeting with him, >> he squeezed the US by tightening the export controls on rare earth minerals. >> He did. and I raised our tariffs to 100% uh on top of what they're already paying, which is far worse. Far worse. We'll see what happens with China. I've always had a great relationship with them, as you know, but uh they're always looking for an edge.</p>

就在几分钟前，我们得到了一些特朗普在空军一号上对记者发表的言论。

> **特朗普关于关税：** 我们可以降低中国需要支付的关税，但中国也必须为我们做些事情。
>
> **特朗普关于大豆：** 对与中国达成大豆协议充满信心。
>
> **特朗普关于稀土：** 不希望中国和我们玩稀土游戏。

<p class="english-text">Okay, we got a lot of quotes. All right, here we go. You guys can see this. All right. Uh, Trump says US is considering buying beef from Argentina. Trump will announce Colombia tariff rate tomorrow. Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One. Okay, that's what I thought on the plane. Trump says we can lower what China has to pay in tariffs, but China has to do things for us, too. Aka, we're willing to negotiate. That's bullish. Trump confident of reaching soybean deal with China.</p>
</details>

这些言论让标普指数立刻转绿。英伟达、特斯拉、Palantir、Robin Hood都上涨了。

### 市场分析：震荡行情与高杠杆

我认为本周的剧本将会是震荡的。我称之为“震荡十月”（Choptober）。原因有二：首先，十月通常波动较大，而且我们经历了八月和九月两个非常好的月份，所以我们应该会迎来一些震荡。其次，我们需要更多的好消息开始汇集和交织，才能让市场兴奋起来，推动标普指数达到7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the the playbook for this week is I mean, let's do a poll right here in the chat. But, um, I think it's gonna be choppy, dude. Instead of October, I think we're having Choptober. I think we are having Choptober. And the reason for that is because a October tends to be volatile and we had two really good months, August, September. So we're kind of due for some choppiness. And then b it's like we need a lot more good news to start of culminating and intersecting with each other for the uh excitement I think that it would take for us to get to 7,000 on the S&P.</p>
</details>

我认为我们现在最缺少的一件事就是财报。我们需要非常好的财报。在得到这些财报之前，我不知道我们是否真的有机会扩大市盈率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the number one thing we're missing right now, we need earnings, bro. We need earnings. We need really good earnings. And until we get those earnings, I don't know if we're necessarily going to even have a chance to expand the multiple.</p>
</details>

与此同时，杠杆ETF的数量达到了历史新高。美国保证金债务也达到了1.13万亿美元的新高，远高于2021年的9000亿美元。这为什么重要？如果市场开始下跌，人们接到追加保证金通知，他们将不得不出售股票来弥补保证金，这会引发更多的抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">leveraged ETFs. We talked about this last week. Leverage ETFs continue to grow massively. Uh we are at an all-time high on the number of leveraged equity ETFs that are out there. So, US margin debt has hit 1.13 trillion, which is a new all-time high. In 2021, it was 900 billion. So, we are well above the 2021 highs of margin debt. Now, why does this matter? Well, if things start going down and people get margin called, they will have to sell equities to cover their margin and that creates an onslaught of more selling.</p>

然而，根据美国银行的数据，上周投资者对科技股的资金流入量是最大的。这不仅仅是散户在抄底，机构基金经理的现金水平也处于历史最低点，为3.8%。正如Tom Lee所说，78%的基金经理尚未达到他们的基准，他们将不得不追赶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">take a look at what Bank of America showed, investors had their largest inflow last week in technology stocks last week. Take a look at institutional fund manager cash levels. So this is not just retail that's buying the dip. It is not just retail that's plowing in money. It is at the lowest level in history. 3.8%. 22% of fund managers have yet to have only met their benchmark. Aka there's uh 78% of fund managers have not met their benchmark. So is that right? They're going to have to chase. They're going to probably have to chase, right?</p>

### 财报前瞻：对特斯拉的期待

我们周三将迎来特斯拉的财报。特斯拉的股价今年迄今为止表现滞后，直到上个月才有所起色，目前仅上涨了15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we've got earnings coming up on Wednesday. Tesla's stock year to date was lagging heavily until the past month. It is now only up 15% year-to- date.</p>
</details>

首先，我终于将我的**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 全自动驾驶，特斯拉开发的先进驾驶辅助系统）更新到了13.2.9版本。我想说，一直以来我最大的抱怨——系统的唠叨提示——开始变得好多了。在以前的版本里，你甚至不能瞥一眼手机，现在我可以拿起手机查看短信、换歌，而不会收到巨大的警告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, I finally updated to 13.2.9 on FSD, um, which is not 14, but I don't have 14 available yet. Hopefully, I get FSD 14 soon. I will say, uh, the nagging, which has been my biggest gripe with FSD for the past couple of weeks, really past couple months, quite frankly, is starting to get way better. I mean, and I don't know if it was just me, but on the previous version, you couldn't even glance at your phone. and now I actually pick up my phone, I can check a text message, I can change the song when I'm looking at music or I can look outside if there's some scenery and when I, you know, look back at the road, I don't have this massive warning telling me to pay attention. It's gotten a lot better.</p>
</details>

但这会影响财报吗？可能不会。我认为影响财报的是交付量。他们交付了近50万辆汽车，好于预期，但市场普遍认为这已经计入预期。华尔街预计本季度盈利将再次出现同比负增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now does that actually affect the earnings? Probably not because you know FSD is not something that they're selling like hotcakes yet. Uh I think what's going to affect the earnings is the is the delivery. So they delivered basically 500,000 cars, 497,000 um and that was better than expected. The problem is I think everyone has already baked those into their estimates. So the street for this earnings is expecting negative growth year-over-year again.</p>
</details>

我不想对特斯拉过于悲观，我只是不知道埃隆·马斯克能说些什么来真正推动股价上涨。薪酬方案将获得投票并通过，他购买了10亿美元的股票，以及49.7万的交付量——我认为这三件事都已经被市场消化了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to be super bearish Tesla. I just don't know if anything Elon can say will be enough to actually get this to move. The fact that the compensation package is going to be voted on and likely go in Elon's favor. The fact that he bought a billion dollars worth of stock. I mean, I think those two things and then the fact that they had 497,000 deliveries because of the EV credit going away and so they really took advantage of that. I think all three of those things are priced in</p>
</details>

特斯拉公司在周三能做些什么来让股价飙升呢？除非是关于Optimus机器人。我一直像个复读机一样说，埃隆需要宣布一份**LOI**（Letter of Intent: 意向书，表示一方有意与另一方进行商业交易的非约束性文件），比如与沃尔玛达成协议，准备购买10万台Optimus。哪怕只是宣布一下，都会很令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What can Tesla the company do on Wednesday that will actually get the stock to blast into the I don't know 470s 480s? Yes, optimist. And I've been I've been saying like this like a broken record over the past couple of at this point I would say five quarters that Elon needs to announce an LOI, a letter of an intent, a letter of intent with a Walmart that is ready to buy 100,000 Optimus. Just even the announcement of a Walmart or a Marta Libre or any of these major companies in their factories are ready to to to you know buy hundreds of thousands of optimism. I mean it doesn't even have to be revenue. could just be a little email that the CEO of Marta Libre sends Elon like, "Hey, if you if you get it ready for us, we're ready to buy it because they would be ready to buy it."</p>
</details>

我不认为股价需要暴跌，因为一切都已计入预期。但股价需要暴涨吗？我不知道公司能做什么来让它暴涨，除非埃隆在财报电话会议上让人们感觉良好，他每次都这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think the stock has to tank because everything's baked in. So if they have negative earnings growth, it's like, okay, we already knew they were going to be negative. But does the stock have to explode? I don't know what would the company do that could possibly get it to explode outside of Elon making people feel happy while he's talking during the earnings call, which he does every time.</p>
</details>

### 总结

总结一下隔夜市场的情况：特朗普就中美关系释放了非常积极的信号，表示不愿陷入大规模关税战，这利好市场。日经指数可能因为美国市场对这些中国评论的积极反应而上涨。黄仁勋接受了重要采访，宣布首批Blackwell芯片晶圆已在美国制造，市场对此反应积极，认为美国制造业正在回归。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, cool. So the summary for the overnight markets are as follows. Trump signaling really good stuff with China in regards to not getting into a massive tariff war. That's bullish. The Nikkay likely up because the US is up based on these China comments. Jensen did a big interview uh first wafer for the blackwell chip was created in the United States over the weekend was the announcement. Markets really like that that is official and American manufacturing is coming back.</p>
</details>

宏观数据方面，杠杆率高，保证金债务高，机构现金配置低，期权交易量持续走高。所有这些因素是利好还是利空，将取决于财报。本周我们将迎来特斯拉和Netflix的财报。如果这些公司能够实现增长，那么标普500指数的市盈率就有可能在年底前继续维持并扩大。我们只需要看看增长是否真的存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in terms of the macro stats, leverage is high, margin debt is high, cash allocation is low institutionally and option volumes continue to go higher. All of those things will either be bullish or bearish based on earnings. And this week we get Tesla and Netflix. We had a bunch of other companies, but Tesla and Netflix are the most important ones. And then the week after that is really when we have our Super Bowl. And if those companies can execute, then I think this multiple for the S&P can continue to sustain itself and expand towards the end of the year. If the earnings growth is really there, we just have to see if that growth can be there.</p>
</details>

总结就是：风险偏好开启。我们正在降息，而盈利状况良好。除非信贷市场出现大规模的结构性变化，否则降息和盈利增长应该是推动市场势头的良方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Summary is risk on. That is correct. I mean, we're cutting rates and earnings are good. We're cutting rates and earnings are good. Unless there's a massive structural change like in the credit markets, and you know, based on the research I've done on regionals, it doesn't seem like it's that big of a deal. We'll see how it plays out over the coming weeks, but rates are down, earnings are up. That should be the recipe to to get some momentum.</p>
