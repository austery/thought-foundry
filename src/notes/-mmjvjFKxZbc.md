### 头条新闻

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, October 9th. Here's what we're covering.

这里是《纽约时报》头条新闻，我是特蕾西·芒福德。今天是10月9日星期四，以下是我们将报道的内容。

### 加沙人质协议取得突破

>> Joining us now live on the phone is the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Mr. President, wow, congratulations, sir. Can you—

>> 现在通过电话连线的是美国总统唐纳德·J·特朗普。总统先生，哇，恭喜您。您能——

Last night in an interview on Fox News, President Trump said that Israel and **Hamas** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动组织) have agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, a breakthrough that comes just days after the war in **Gaza** (Gaza: 中东地区的一个地带，位于以色列和埃及之间) passed the 2-year mark.

在昨晚福克斯新闻的一次采访中，特朗普总统表示，以色列和哈马斯已就一项和平计划的第一阶段达成协议，这一突破性的进展发生在加沙战争两周年纪念日后的几天。

>> The whole world came together, to be honest. So many countries that you wouldn't have even thought of, and they came together. The world has come together around this deal.

>> 老实说，全世界都团结起来了。许多你甚至不曾想到的国家，它们都汇聚在一起。全世界都围绕着这项协议团结起来了。

Under the agreement, which was pushed by Trump and negotiated via Qatari mediators in Egypt, Hamas will release all of the remaining living hostages as soon as this weekend.

根据这项由特朗普推动并通过卡塔尔调解人在埃及谈判达成的协议，哈马斯将于本周末释放所有剩余的在世人质。

They're believed to still be holding about 20 people.

据信他们仍扣押着大约20人。

In exchange, Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and will pull back its troops in Gaza to an agreed upon line.

作为交换，以色列将释放近2000名巴勒斯坦囚犯和被拘留者，并将加沙境内的部队撤回到商定的防线。

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he'll convene his cabinet today to sign off on the deal.

以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡表示，他将于今天召集内阁会议，批准这项协议。

But some of the most contentious issues between Israel and Hamas seem to have been left up to future negotiations, including whether Israeli forces will eventually leave the territory entirely, whether Hamas will give up its weapons, and who will rule a post-war Gaza.

但以色列和哈马斯之间一些最具争议的问题似乎留待未来谈判，包括以色列军队是否最终会完全撤离该地区，哈马斯是否会放弃武器，以及战后的加沙将由谁来统治。

Still, the initial breakthrough after months of deadlocked negotiations sparked hope across the region.

尽管如此，经过数月僵持谈判后的初步突破，仍在该地区燃起了希望。

What do you guys have to say to President Trump?

你们对特朗普总统有什么想说的吗？

In a brief phone call, some of the family members of the Israeli hostages thanked President Trump personally for his involvement in the negotiations.

在一次简短的电话通话中，一些以色列人质的家属亲自感谢特朗普总统参与了谈判。

And in Gaza, where more than 67,000 people have been killed and more than 90% of homes have been destroyed, Palestinians told the Times that they were eagerly awaiting a possible end to the fighting.

而在加沙，已有超过67000人丧生，90%以上的房屋被毁，巴勒斯坦人告诉《泰晤士报》，他们正焦急地等待战斗可能结束。

One English teacher there said he was feeling a mix of joy and sadness with optimism that the war might soon be over, but sorrow for everything we've lost.

当地一位英语老师说，他感到喜忧参半，既乐观地认为战争可能很快结束，又为我们失去的一切感到悲伤。

### 美国政府在加勒比海动武引发争议

On **Capitol Hill** (Capitol Hill: 美国国会所在地) yesterday, **Senate Democrats** (Senate Democrats: 民主党参议员) tried to block President Trump from using military force against boats in the Caribbean, but their effort failed as nearly all Republican senators voted against the measure.

昨天在国会山，民主党参议员试图阻止特朗普总统在加勒比海对船只使用军事力量，但由于几乎所有共和党参议员都投票反对该议案，他们的努力失败了。

>> These strikes were not authorized by Congress. Congress has not been shown the evidence of who exactly was on board these ships. Such strikes are not legal.

>> 这些打击行动未经国会授权。国会尚未获得关于这些船只上到底有谁的证据。此类打击行动是不合法的。

>> On this vote, the yays are 48, the nays are 51, and the motion is not agreed to.

>> 在这次投票中，赞成48票，反对51票，该动议未获通过。

Since early September, the **Trump administration** (Trump administration: 特朗普政府) says it's blown up four boats and killed over 20 people who it claims were smuggling drugs into the US from Venezuela.

自9月初以来，特朗普政府表示已炸毁四艘船只，并打死了20多人，声称这些人是从委内瑞拉向美国走私毒品的。

Trump recently said he determined that the US is in a formal armed conflict with **drug cartels** (drug cartels: 贩毒集团).

特朗普最近表示，他认定美国与贩毒集团处于正式武装冲突状态。

But the strikes on boats have largely been seen by experts in military law as illegal and the attacks have drawn intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers who said that the **White House** (White House: 美国总统的官邸和主要办公场所) has offered no credible evidence that would justify the strikes.

但军事法律专家普遍认为对船只的打击是非法的，这些袭击也招致了民主党议员的强烈批评，他们表示白宫没有提供任何可信的证据来证明这些打击行动是正当的。

Meanwhile, the president of Colombia yesterday said one of the boats the US bombed was from his country, not Venezuela.

与此同时，哥伦比亚总统昨天表示，美国轰炸的一艘船来自他的国家，而非委内瑞拉。

He said Colombian citizens had been killed.

他说有哥伦比亚公民遇难。

Two American officials also told the Times that Colombians were on board at least one of the boats the US destroyed.

两名美国官员也告诉《泰晤士报》，美国摧毁的至少一艘船上载有哥伦比亚人。

The White House dismissed the Colombian president's comments as baseless and reprehensible.

白宫驳斥了哥伦比亚总统的言论，称其为“毫无根据且应受谴责的”。

### 特朗普向美国城市部署军队计划面临法律挑战

Today, federal judges will hear arguments in two separate legal cases over President Trump's plans to deploy troops in US cities.

今天，联邦法官将审理两起独立的法律案件，涉及特朗普总统在美国城市部署军队的计划。

First up, Portland.

首先是波特兰。

Trump has tried to send in **National Guardsmen** (National Guardsmen: 美国各州军事力量，在州长指挥下执行任务，也可联邦化), saying the city is burning to the ground.

特朗普曾试图派遣国民警卫队，声称这座城市正在被夷为平地。

A federal judge blocked that effort over the weekend, calling Trump's assessment simply untethered to the facts.

一名联邦法官于周末阻止了这一努力，称特朗普的评估“完全脱离事实”。

But the government appealed and now a panel of judges will hear more arguments today.

但政府提出了上诉，现在一个法官小组将于今天听取更多论点。

The president's assessment of Portland is at odds with descriptions from federal officers on the ground there.

总统对波特兰的评估与当地联邦官员的描述不符。

On the same day, Trump called the city under siege from mobs protesting **ICE** (ICE: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 负责执行美国移民和海关法律的联邦机构).

同一天，特朗普称这座城市正遭受抗议移民及海关执法局（ICE）的暴徒围攻。

Officers at an ICE facility described the protests as low energy in internal reports seen by the Times.

《泰晤士报》看到的内部报告显示，ICE设施的官员将这些抗议活动描述为“低能量”的。

Local officials said this week though that the small demonstrations have grown more intense since the president posted about Portland on social media.

然而，当地官员本周表示，自从总统在社交媒体上发布有关波特兰的消息以来，小规模的示威活动变得更加激烈。

And in Illinois, a federal judge will hear arguments about whether to stop the deployments of National Guard troops there after several hundred were sent to the state from Texas this week.

在伊利诺伊州，一名联邦法官将听取关于是否停止在该州部署国民警卫队部队的辩论，此前本周已有数百名士兵从得克萨斯州被派往该州。

The Trump administration has said the troops are necessary for safety, citing crime rates and rising tensions around immigration enforcement operations.

特朗普政府表示，这些部队对于安全是必要的，理由是犯罪率和围绕移民执法行动日益紧张的局势。

But state officials have objected and Governor JB Pritsker described it as an invasion.

但州官员表示反对，州长JB·普利茨克将其描述为“入侵”。

Yesterday, Trump doubled down, claiming Pritsker, who is a Democrat, should be in jail for what Trump described as failing to protect ICE officers.

昨天，特朗普变本加厉，声称作为民主党人的普利茨克应该入狱，因为他“未能保护ICE官员”。

>> Out. He said he was going to jail Gavin Newsome. He says he's going to jail me. He says he's going to jail the mayor of the city of Chicago.

>> 他说他要把加文·纽森送进监狱。他说他要把我送进监狱。他说他要把芝加哥市长送进监狱。

Pritsker dismissed Trump's threat.

普利茨克不屑一顾地回应了特朗普的威胁。

>> Come and get me. Come and get me. This week, the governor claimed Trump's ultimate goal is to normalize military patrols in American cities, potentially to even intimidate voters in future elections, saying, "He wants us all in big cities to get used to the idea that it's okay to have military on the streets. You're going to see soldiers outside your polling place. That's going to intimidate a lot of people."

>> 来抓我啊。来抓我啊。本周，州长声称特朗普的最终目标是使美国城市的军事巡逻常态化，甚至可能恐吓未来选举中的选民，他说：“他想让我们所有大城市的人都习惯街上有军队的想法。你会在投票站外看到士兵。那会恐吓很多人。”

### 洛杉矶致命野火嫌犯被捕

>> After more than eight months of tireless, meticulous work, I stand here with our partners, proud to announce an arrest in connection to the devastating **Palisade fires** (Palisade fires: 发生在美国洛杉矶帕利塞德斯地区的一场毁灭性野火) that claimed lives, destroyed homes, and shook this community to its core.

>> 经过八个多月不懈而细致的工作，我与我们的合作伙伴站在这里，自豪地宣布，我们已逮捕一名与毁灭性的帕利塞德斯大火有关的嫌疑人，这场大火夺走了生命，摧毁了家园，并从根本上动摇了这个社区。

In Los Angeles yesterday, officials announced they've arrested a 29-year-old man, saying he was responsible for the wildfire in January that killed 12 people and burned thousands of buildings.

昨天在洛杉矶，官员们宣布逮捕了一名29岁的男子，称他对一月份导致12人死亡、数千座建筑物被烧毁的野火负有责任。

Geolocation data showed that he was standing above the fire in a clearing merely 30 feet from the blaze as it rapidly grew.

地理定位数据显示，当大火迅速蔓延时，他正站在火灾上方的一片空地上，距离火场仅30英尺。

The authorities said that about a week before the Palisades blaze, the man, who was an **Uber driver** (Uber driver: 优步司机) and former resident of the neighborhood, intentionally set a small fire on a hiking trail nearby.

当局表示，在帕利塞德斯大火发生大约一周前，这名男子（一名优步司机，也是该社区的前居民）故意在附近的一条徒步小径上点燃了一小堆火。

Within hours, that fire was extinguished, but smoldering embers were left over that eventually roared back to life.

几小时内，那场火被扑灭了，但留下的闷燃余烬最终又死灰复燃。

Officials said that the suspect appeared to have been obsessed with fire and that before lighting it, he was listening to a song on YouTube featuring a character setting things on fire.

官员们表示，嫌疑人似乎对火着迷，在点火之前，他正在YouTube上听一首歌曲，其中一个角色正在放火。

Hours after his arrest was announced, the LA Fire Department released an internal review, calling the blaze a perfect storm, fueled by dry conditions and hurricane force winds, and made worse by staffing shortages.

在他被捕的消息公布数小时后，洛杉矶消防局发布了一份内部审查报告，称这场大火是一场“完美风暴”，由干燥天气和飓风级大风助长，并因人员短缺而变得更加糟糕。

Many survivors of the fire have since sued, saying that emergency responders were negligent and hadn't properly prepared for the extreme conditions.

许多火灾幸存者此后提起诉讼，称应急响应人员玩忽职守，没有为极端条件做好充分准备。

One Palisades resident who lost his home told the Times, "I'm angry that an individual would be so depraved. It doesn't take away my sense of frustration and anger with government."

一位在帕利塞德斯大火中失去家园的居民告诉《泰晤士报》：“我对一个人如此堕落感到愤怒。但这并没有消除我对政府的沮丧和愤怒。”

### 多莉·帕顿健康传闻澄清

And finally, **Dolly Parton** (Dolly Parton: 美国乡村音乐传奇人物) wants to let people know she's not dead yet.

最后，多莉·帕顿想让大家知道她还活着。

>> I wanted to say I know lately everybody thinks that I am sicker than I am. Do I look sick to you? I'm working hard here.

>> 我想说，我知道最近每个人都觉得我病得比实际要重。你看我像病人吗？我在这里努力工作呢。

Fans of the 79-year-old country legend have been in a frenzy since Parton postponed her **Las Vegas residency** (Las Vegas residency: 拉斯维加斯驻场演出) last month, citing medical issues.

这位79岁的乡村传奇人物的粉丝们一直处于狂热状态，因为帕顿上个月以健康问题为由推迟了她在拉斯维加斯的驻场演出。

Add in some **AI created videos** (AI created videos: 人工智能生成视频) that made the rounds on social media and rumors about her health have been running rampant.

再加上一些在社交媒体上流传的人工智能生成视频，关于她健康的谣言甚嚣尘上。

Things hit a whole new level this week when her younger sister asked people to pray for Dolly.

本周，当她的妹妹请求人们为多莉祈祷时，事态达到了一个新的高度。

>> But I figured if you heard it from me, you'd know that I was okay. Parton released a video to reassure her fans, saying she's still working hard.

>> 但我想如果你们从我这里听到，你们就会知道我没事。帕顿发布了一段视频以安抚她的粉丝，说她仍在努力工作。

A little reminder of how hard she can work.

一个小小的提醒，她能有多努力。

She is credited with writing the hits **Jolene and I Will Always Love You** (Jolene and I Will Always Love You: 多莉·帕顿的著名歌曲) on the same day.

她被认为是同一天创作出热门歌曲《乔琳》和《我将永远爱你》的。

Those are the headlines today on the daily.

以上是今天的每日头条新闻。

The **Supreme Court** (Supreme Court: 美国联邦司法系统的最高法院) is kicking off its term this week with a case about **conversion therapy** (conversion therapy: 一种试图改变个人性取向或性别认同的治疗方法，通常被主流医学和心理学组织认为无效且有害) and the question of whether mental health professionals are legally allowed to try and change a child's sexual orientation or gender identity.

本周，最高法院将以一个关于转化疗法的案件开启其会期，该案件涉及心理健康专业人士是否被法律允许尝试改变儿童的性取向或性别认同。

You can listen to that in the New York Times app or wherever you get your podcasts.
