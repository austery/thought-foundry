### 经济成就与药物降价

At this moment, I think we just cracked $18 trillion in commitments and investments in our country.
此刻，我认为我国的承诺和投资总额刚刚突破了18万亿美元。

As an example, the last administration was far less than $1 trillion for four years. We're at plus $18 trillion for eight months.
举例来说，上届政府四年任期内的投资远不到1万亿美元。而我们八个月内就达到了18万亿美元以上。

There's never been anything like it in history, in any country anywhere in the world. So that's great.
这在历史上、在世界上任何国家都是前所未有的。所以这很棒。

But maybe for purposes of this, more importantly, we're going to bring drug prices down at numbers that nobody ever thought possible. Done.
但也许就今天而言，更重要的是，我们将把药价降到前所未有的水平。这已经完成了。

I think nobody ever even thought it was possible. So, we're going to be doing a lot of business, but we're going to be also numbers that when you're two, three, four, five hundred percent less.
我想没有人曾认为这是可能的。所以，我们将做很多生意，但同时也会让价格低两、三百、四五百个百分点。

I just noticed one of them over here: 654% discount.
我刚注意到其中一个：654%的折扣。

The laggard is 98%.
即使是最慢的也有98%。

Right. Nine is that what? Wow. It's 96, 96, 230%, but 654.
对。九是多少？哇。是96、96、230%，但也有654%。

And we have some that top that by a lot. So it's really going to be incredible. And that's going to be so good for **Medicaid** (Medicaid: 美国联邦和州政府联合资助的医疗保健计划，为低收入和资源有限的个人提供医疗服务) and **Medicare** (Medicare: 美国联邦政府为65岁及以上老年人以及符合特定条件的年轻残疾人提供的医疗保险计划) and everything, frankly, for your life. It's going to be so good.
我们还有很多远远超过这个数字。所以这真的会令人难以置信。坦白说，这对医疗补助、医疗保险以及你们的生活中的方方面面都会非常好。

So nobody ever thought they were going to see. And don't let Democrats take the credit because you know they'll try.
所以没有人会想到会看到这样的结果。不要让民主党人抢走功劳，因为他们会尝试的。

They'll say, "Oh, we worked so hard," and they didn't work hard. They obstructed; they actually did the opposite.
他们会说，“哦，我们工作很努力”，但他们并没有努力工作。他们是在阻挠，他们实际上做了相反的事情。

So that's really more important than even the tremendous investments being made in our country.
所以这比我们国家正在进行的巨大投资甚至更重要。

But think of it, we cracked $18 trillion and frankly $1 trillion for four years wasn't that bad. He did less than a trillion, but we did that in a period of eight months.
但想想看，我们突破了18万亿美元，坦白说，四年1万亿美元也不是那么糟。他做的不到1万亿美元，而我们在八个月内就做到了。

So it's pretty record shattering by many trillions of dollars. Any country, no matter what country you're talking about, nobody's done numbers like that.
所以这以数万亿美元计，相当于是打破了纪录。任何国家，无论你谈论的是哪个国家，都没有人做出过这样的数字。

So, thank you all for being here. Do you want to have a couple of questions? Yeah, please.
所以，感谢大家前来。你们想提几个问题吗？好的，请。

### 关税策略与制药合作

**Reporter:** Mr. President, one on this if I could, one on China if I may. First on this, could you have brought these pharmaceutical companies to the table without that 100% tariff that you imposed?
**记者:** 总统先生，如果可以的话，我想问一个关于这个问题和一个关于中国的问题。首先关于这个问题，如果没有你施加的100%**关税** (tariffs: 政府对进口或出口商品征收的税，旨在保护国内产业或增加收入)，你是否能让这些制药公司参与谈判？

Well, it's not 100%. You're talking about China might be...
嗯，那不是100%。你说的可能是中国……

**Reporter:** I'm talking about the 100% you imposed on pharmaceuticals for that section.
**记者:** 我说的是你对该部分药品征收的100%关税。

I would never have been able to bring them. Now, I'm not sure that Pascal would like to say, but behind the scenes, he did say tariffs were a big reason he came here.
我绝不可能把他们带来。现在，我不确定帕斯卡是否愿意这么说，但在幕后，他确实说过关税是他来这里的一大原因。

And also the fact he loved Virginia, he liked this guy. He liked me. I think the November 5th election was a very important date. We had a good election. And that was important.
还有他喜欢弗吉尼亚州的事实，他喜欢这个人。他喜欢我。我认为11月5日的选举是一个非常重要的日子。我们进行了一场很好的选举。这很重要。

But yeah, he's here. A lot of, I can speak for almost everybody that's here, most of them are here because of tariffs.
但是，是的，他在这里。在场的很多人，我几乎可以代表所有在场的人说，他们中的大多数人都是因为关税而来的。

Because you have to understand he has no tariffs. If you build in this country, there are no tariffs.
因为你必须明白，他没有关税。如果你在这个国家建厂，就没有关税。

### 中美关系与出口管制

**Reporter:** Let me ask you about China if I could. Just want to confirm, have you canceled your meeting with President Xi?
**记者:** 如果可以，我想问你关于中国的问题。只是想确认一下，你是否已经取消了与习主席的会面？

No, I haven't canceled, but I don't know that we're going to have it, but I'm going to be there regardless. So, I would assume we might have it.
不，我没有取消，但我不知道我们是否会举行，但无论如何我都会在那里。所以，我猜我们可能会举行。

But, you know, they hit the world with something that really is not anything that people are going to do. And it was shocking.
但是，你知道，他们用一种人们根本不会做的事情打击了全世界。这令人震惊。

And I can tell you Howard and I and Todd, we all, we all, Scott were all speaking about it before and it was we said, "Where did that come from?"
我可以告诉你，霍华德、我还有托德，我们所有人，斯科特，我们之前都在谈论这件事，我们说：“这从何而来？”

It was just, that was out of the blue, right? Out of the blue, they came up with this whole import export concept and nobody, nobody knew anything about it.
那完全是突如其来的，对吧？毫无征兆地，他们提出了这个整体的进出口概念，而且没有人，没有人知道任何关于它的事情。

**Reporter:** So if they roll back their export controls, the new announcement, would you roll back?
**记者:** 那么如果他们撤销了新的出口管制，你会撤销吗？

Look, we're going to have to see what happens. That's why I made it November 1st. We'll see what happens. Yeah.
看，我们得看看会发生什么。这就是我把日期定在11月1日的原因。我们会看看会发生什么。好的。

**Reporter:** Mr. President, the last time, Mr. President, go ahead, please.
**记者:** 总统先生，上次，总统先生，请继续。

What else besides software could be on the table in terms of export control?
除了软件，在出口管制方面还有什么可能被摆上台面？

A lot more, a lot more. I mean, you have, you have, you have a lot more. We have airplanes. We have airplane parts.
还有很多，很多。我的意思是，你还有很多。我们有飞机。我们有飞机零件。

You remember that from last time? And we were just surprised that China, I have a very good relationship with President Xi, and they did that.
你还记得上次的事吗？我们只是很惊讶中国，我和习主席关系非常好，而他们却做了那件事。

This is not something that I, you know, instigated. This was just a response to something that they did.
这不是我，你知道，煽动的事情。这只是对他们所做之事的回应。

And they didn't really aim it at us. They aimed it at the whole world. The whole world is subject to it.
他们并不是真的针对我们。他们是针对全世界。全世界都受其影响。

So I thought it was very, very bad. But we have many things including a big thing is airplane.
所以我认为这非常非常糟糕。但我们有很多牌可打，其中一项重要的事情就是飞机。

They have a lot of Boeing planes and they need parts and lots of things like that.
他们有很多波音飞机，他们需要零件以及许多类似的东西。

### 加沙协议与中东和平

**Reporter:** Steve, how did you persuade Israeli Prime Minister to accept the Gaza deal and what will be your message to the commencements when you speak to him?
**记者:** 史蒂夫，你是如何说服以色列总理接受加沙协议的？当你和他对话时，你会向开端的人们传达什么信息？

Well, he wanted it. You know, it's been a long time. He's been fighting a long time. He's been fighting hard. He wanted it.
嗯，他想要这个。你知道，这已经很长时间了。他已经战斗了很长时间。他一直在努力战斗。他想要这个。

It's a great deal for Israel, but it's a great deal for everybody, for Arabs, for Muslims, for everybody, for the world.
这对以色列来说是笔大买卖，但对所有人，对阿拉伯人，对穆斯林，对每个人，对全世界来说，都是笔大买卖。

And as you know, on Monday, the hostages come back. They're getting them now.
而且你知道，周一，人质会回来。他们现在正在营救他们。

I mean, they're getting them now. They're in some pretty rough places under Earth.
我的意思是，他们现在正在把人质救出来。他们在地底的一些相当艰苦的地方。

They're in some pretty rough places where only a few people know where they are in some cases. So, they're getting them.
他们位于一些非常艰苦的地方，在某些情况下只有少数人知道他们的位置。所以，他们正在把人质救出来。

And they're also getting the bodies, approximately 28 bodies, and some of those bodies are being unearthed right now as we speak.
他们也正在找回尸体，大约有28具尸体，其中一些尸体在我们说话的此刻正在被挖掘出来。

I mean, they're working on it right now as we speak. It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy. No, he was very happy with it.
我的意思是，我们说话的此刻他们正在进行这项工作。这是一个悲剧。这是一个悲剧。不，他对这个结果非常满意。

And I can tell you that I saw Israel dancing in the streets, but they were dancing in Qatar and Saudi Arabia and UAE and many, many countries.
我可以告诉你，我看到以色列人在街上跳舞，但卡塔尔、沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋以及许多许多国家的人也在跳舞。

I saw Egypt, they were dancing. I'll be going to Israel. I'll be speaking at the **Knesset** (Knesset: 以色列的立法机关，即以色列议会) early on, and then I'm also going to Egypt.
我看到埃及人也在跳舞。我将前往以色列。我会在早期在以色列议会发表演讲，然后我也会去埃及。

They were terrific. But all of the countries were great. Indonesia was great. Jordan was great.
他们表现出色。所有这些国家都很棒。印度尼西亚很棒。约旦很棒。

They're all great. Everybody, everybody wants this deal to happen.
他们都很棒。每个人，每个人都希望这项协议能够实现。

**Reporter:** The day after the hostage release. What happens there then?
**记者:** 人质获释的第二天。那时会发生什么？

Well, hopefully you're going to have great success for, I call it, everlasting success. I think you will, too.
嗯，希望你们会取得巨大的成功，我称之为“永恒的成功”。我想你们也会。

I think you're going to have tremendous success and Gaza is going to be rebuilt and you have some very wealthy countries, as you know, over there.
我认为你们将取得巨大的成功，加沙将会重建，而且你知道，那里有一些非常富裕的国家。

And it would take a small fraction of their wealth to do that, but and I think they want to do it.
这只需要他们财富的一小部分就可以完成，而且我认为他们愿意这么做。

And we're also setting up, as you know, a board of peace. It's called the board of peace. I don't know if that's the final name, but the word peace is definitely in there.
而且我们也在组建，你知道，一个和平委员会。它叫做和平委员会。我不知道这是否是最终名称，但“和平”这个词肯定在里面。

And they asked me if I chair it. We'll make sure things go well.
他们问我是否愿意担任主席。我们会确保事情顺利进行。

### 停火信心与地区支持

**Reporter:** And how confident are you that the ceasefire will hold?
**记者:** 你对停火协议的持久性有多大信心？

I think it'll hold. Yeah, I think it'll hold. They're all tired of the fighting.
我想它会持续下去。是的，我想它会持续下去。他们都厌倦了战争。

Don't forget you had October 7th, which was a horrible day. 1,200 people killed.
别忘了，10月7日是一个可怕的日子。有1200人被杀。

But **Hamas** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰主义政治和军事组织，目前控制加沙地带) has lost 58,000 people. That's big retribution. That's big retribution.
但哈马斯已经损失了58000人。这是巨大的报应。这是巨大的报应。

People understand that. So, no, I think they're all tired of fighting and this really gives the whole Middle East, this is beyond Gaza.
人们明白这一点。所以，不，我认为他们都厌倦了战斗，而这确实给了整个中东，这超越了加沙。

Gaza is very important, but this is beyond Gaza. This is peace in the Middle East. And it is a beautiful thing.
加沙非常重要，但这超越了加沙。这是中东的和平。这是一件美好的事情。

You know, it's a term that you and I have been hearing since we were very young, right? And now we have a chance of really having that.
你知道，这是你我从小就听到的一个词，对吧？现在我们真的有机会实现它了。

And as you know, most of the countries have passed all these resolutions. Every country is there. Iran came in. And I was very happy to see that.
而且你知道，大多数国家都通过了这些决议。每个国家都在那里。伊朗也参与了。我很高兴看到这一点。

I was very honored that Iran came in. They said they support it. Russia came in. President Putin, he supports it fully. Very fully.
伊朗的加入让我感到非常荣幸。他们表示支持。俄罗斯也加入了。普京总统完全支持。非常完全地支持。

So I was happy to see even countries that weren't necessarily involved in the process. They all support it.
所以我很高兴看到甚至那些不一定参与到这个过程中的国家，都支持它。

I don't know of anybody that doesn't. And I've never seen happier people than many of these places, not just Israel.
我不知道有谁不支持。而且我从未见过比这些地方的人们更快乐的，不只是以色列。

Many of these places. They're all dancing in the streets. I've never seen anything like it.
很多这些地方。他们都在街上跳舞。我从未见过这样的情景。

### 哈马斯的态度与和平前景

**记者:** 总统先生，后面那位请。谢谢。你给了哈马斯什么保证，说服他们以色列在人质交换后不会重启轰炸行动？

What did I do with respect to them?
我针对他们做了什么？

Well, you know, I spoke a little bit tough and that's what would happen. I mean, you have to speak tough.
嗯，你知道，我话说得有点强硬，而这正是会发生的情况。我的意思是，你必须说得强硬。

It's a, that's a tough world. That's a tough, as they say, neighborhood. And they're tough people.
那是一个艰难的世界。那是一个艰难的，他们常说的，社区。而且他们是强硬的人。

They're very tough people and they're smart people. They're good negotiators.
他们是非常强硬的人，也是聪明的人。他们是很好的谈判者。

You know, they have a lot of things going. They put that to good use. They're going to be very, very successful.
你知道，他们有很多事情在进行。他们很好地利用了这一点。他们将会非常非常成功。

But, they knew the retribution would be tremendous, unsustainable.
但是，他们知道报复将是巨大的，是不可持续的。

It would have been unsustainable. Would have been, it would have been complete obliteration.
那将是不可持续的。那将是，那将是彻底的毁灭。

And they didn't want that. And nobody wants it at this point. They want to get on with, you know, rebuilding the entire Middle East.
他们不想要那样。此刻没有人想要那样。他们想继续，你知道，重建整个中东。

It's not only Gaza, it's going to be the entire Middle East. They're going to be able to live in peace.
不仅仅是加沙，将是整个中东。他们将能够生活在和平之中。

Now, we have some little hot spots, but they're very small. You know the ones I'm talking about. They're very small.
现在，我们有一些小小的热点地区，但它们非常小。你知道我指的是哪些。它们非常小。

They'll be very easy to put out. Those fires are going to be put out very quickly. Yes, ma'am.
它们将非常容易被扑灭。那些火将很快被扑灭。是的，女士。

### 和平计划的共识与后续

**Reporter:** Thank you, Mr. President. Talking about the Middle East, still going to the phases that come after this first phase. Is there consensus on the additional points in your plan or are the details still being fine tuned?
**记者:** 谢谢你，总统先生。谈到中东，关于第一阶段之后即将到来的阶段。您的计划中的其他要点是否已经达成共识，还是细节仍在微调中？

I think there is consensus on most of it and some of the details like anything else will be worked out because you'll find out that when you're sitting in a beautiful room in Egypt, you know, it's easier to work something out, but then sometimes it doesn't work from a practical standpoint.
我认为大部分已经达成共识，而一些细节，就像其他任何事情一样，将会解决，因为你会发现，当你在埃及的一个漂亮的房间里坐着时，你知道，事情更容易解决，但有时从实际角度来看却行不通。

So certain little things but for the most part there's consensus. Yes.
所以有些小事情是这样，但大部分都已达成共识。是的。

**Reporter:** Do you intend to hash that out when you're in Egypt?
**记者:** 你打算在埃及的时候把这些事情敲定吗？

I might. Yeah. I mean I'll be there because I'll be going to, I think we'll I'll go to Cairo.
我可能会。是的。我的意思是，我会在那里，因为我将去，我想我会去开罗。

I think that's where we're going as opposed to the place of the signing and we have a lot of leaders from all over the world coming to, you know, they've been invited and then I'm coming back.
我认为我们要去的是开罗，而不是签署地点，而且我们有很多来自世界各地的领导人会来，你知道，他们都受到了邀请，然后我就会回来。

I believe it's Tuesday night for Charlie Kirk, a friend of mine, a friend of all of ours in front of a lot of the people right here and we're giving him the **Presidential Medal of Freedom** (Presidential Medal of Freedom: 美国最高平民荣誉，授予那些为美国国家利益、世界和平、文化或其他重要公共或私人事业做出杰出贡献的人士), which is the highest honor you get outside of the **Congressional Medal of Honor** (Congressional Medal of Honor: 美国最高军事荣誉，授予在作战中表现出超乎寻常的英勇行为的军人).
我相信是在周二晚上，为了查理·柯克，我的一个朋友，也是我们大家的朋友，当着这里很多人的面，我们将授予他总统自由勋章，这是除了国会荣誉勋章之外你能获得的最高荣誉。

One's military, one's civilian, but it's, it's the greatest honor. And Erica's beautiful wife is going to be here, and a lot of people are going to be here.
一个是军事荣誉，一个是平民荣誉，但它，它是最伟大的荣誉。艾丽卡美丽的妻子也会在这里，很多人都会在这里。

So, you know, it's not easy for me to get back. It's, it's a very quick trip, but I'll be making two major stops, and then I'll be on the plane trying to get back in time for Charlie.
所以，你知道，我回去并不容易。这是一次非常快的旅行，但我会进行两次重要的停留，然后我会搭飞机赶回去，争取及时赶上查理。

They're going to have a great celebration at the White House in the East Room of the White House.
他们将在白宫东厅举行盛大的庆祝活动。

### 政府裁员与移民政策

**Reporter:** Mr. President, um Russell Vog said the reductions in force have begun related to this shutdown. How many layoffs have you authorized for this first round and from which agencies?
**记者:** 总统先生，呃，拉塞尔·沃格说，与这次停摆相关的裁员已经开始。你批准了第一轮多少裁员，以及来自哪些机构？

And it'll be Democrat oriented because we figure, you know, they started this thing so they should be Democrat oriented. It'll be a lot and we'll announce the numbers over the next couple of days, but it'll be a lot of people all because of the Democrats.
这将是针对民主党人的，因为我们认为，你知道，他们挑起了这件事，所以应该针对民主党人。人数会很多，我们会在未来几天公布具体数字，但很多人被裁都是因为民主党人。

I mean they want to give $1.5 trillion dollars to people that came into the country illegally.
我的意思是，他们想把1.5万亿美元给那些非法入境的人。

More important than that because we all have a big heart. We want people to be taken care of.
比这更重要的是，我们都有颗善良的心。我们希望人们得到照顾。

But you know, we have zero people coming in. You know that, Glenn, right? That's, that's a pretty impressive number even for a successful governor.
但是你知道，我们现在没有非法入境的人了。格伦，你知道吧？即使对于一个成功的州长来说，这也是一个相当令人印象深刻的数字。

But we've had for the last four months zero people coming in illegally. They're coming in, but they're coming in legally.
但在过去四个月里，我们没有一个非法入境的人。他们进来了，但他们是合法入境的。

They're coming in through a process that's really a really good process right now because we want people to come in, but they have to come in legally.
他们通过一个目前确实非常好的程序入境，因为我们希望人们进来，但他们必须合法入境。

So what we're doing is as these different groups come due, we're going to make a determination. Do we want them to allow?
所以我们正在做的是，随着这些不同的群体到期，我们将做出决定。我们是否允许他们留下？

And I must tell you, a lot of them happen to be Democrat oriented.
我必须告诉你，他们中很多人恰好是偏向民主党的。

These are people that the Democrats wanted that in many cases were not appropriate. We fought them at the time and it was ultimately signed in.
这些人是民主党想要的，但在很多情况下并不合适。我们当时与他们对抗，但最终还是签署了。

And some of these people, these are largely people that the Democrats want. Many of them will be fired. Yes, please. Behind.
而这些人，他们大多是民主党想要的人。他们中的许多人将被解雇。是的，请。后面那位。

### 诺贝尔和平奖与外交成就

Which one?
哪一个？

**Reporter:** The Nobel Peace Prize. You want your thoughts?
**记者:** 诺贝尔和平奖。你想发表看法吗？

Look, I, including a very big one. And I'm not sure, you know, when you say big, it's certainly, I think, to the mind of most, the most important deal ever made in terms of peace.
看，我，包括一个非常大的。而且我不确定，你知道，当你说“大”的时候，这当然是，我认为，在大多数人看来，在和平方面有史以来最重要的协议。

But the one we just signed, it's been signed, sealed, and it's going to start taking place now. It's already started.
但我们刚刚签署的这份协议，它已经签署，盖章，现在即将开始实施。它已经开始了。

Monday is going to be a very big day when the hostages come back. But I made eight deals, transactions of wars.
周一将是一个非常重要的日子，人质将返回。但我达成了八项协议，解决了战争问题。

One was 31 years going on. 10 million people were killed. One was 34 years, one was 36, 37.
其中一场持续了31年。1000万人丧生。一场持续了34年，一场36年，一场37年。

One was 10. One was just starting. Two were just starting actually, but they were well on their way.
一场是10年。一场刚刚开始。实际上有两场刚刚开始，但它们进展顺利。

In the case of India and Pakistan, seven planes were shot down. It was, it was a bad one.
在印度和巴基斯坦的案例中，七架飞机被击落。那是一次很糟糕的事件。

And I, I did it largely through trade. I mean that one numerous of them. I talked tariffs.
我，我主要是通过贸易来解决的。我的意思是，那其中有许多案例。我谈到了关税。

I said, "Look, if you're going to do that, we're going to put very big tariffs on your country," and they were both great.
我说：“听着，如果你要那样做，我们就会对你们国家征收非常高的关税。”他们两国都表现得很棒。

They, they stopped fighting and they were two nuclear powers. So you know, they're all big.
他们，他们停止了战斗，而且他们是两个核大国。所以你知道，他们都很重要。

There every one of them big. You take, if you take a look at the Congo, you take a look at the Congo and Rwanda, 10 million people killed over a long period of time. Got that one solved.
每一个都很重要。你看看刚果，你看看刚果和卢旺达，长期以来有1000万人丧生。我们解决了那个问题。

We, we did a total of eight as of this two days ago. I would have said seven, which I did say, but the other one was signed up, sealed as you know.
我们，截至两天前总共解决了八个问题。我之前会说是七个，我确实是这么说的，但你知道，另一个已经签署并盖章了。

The Israel signed it just now. They signed it and they approved it today, their parliament.
以色列刚刚签署了。他们今天签署并由他们的议会批准了。

And it's a great honor to be involved with so many, so the person who actually got the Nobel Prize called today, called me and said that I'm accepting this in honor of you because you really deserved it.
能参与到这么多事情中是莫大的荣幸，所以今天实际获得诺贝尔奖的人打电话给我，说他代表我接受这份荣誉，因为我才是真正值得获得的人。

That a very nice thing to do. I, I didn't, I didn't say then give it to me though because I think she might have. She was very nice and I've been, you know, I've been helping her along the way.
那是一件非常好的事情。我，我当时没有说把它给我，因为我想她可能会给。她人很好，而且我一直，你知道，一直在帮助她。

She, they've, they need a lot of help in Venezuela. It's a basic disaster.
她，他们，委内瑞拉需要很多帮助。那简直是一场灾难。

So and you could also say it was given out for '24 and I was running for office in '24.
所以你也可以说那是为2024年颁发的，而我在2024年正在竞选公职。

You know all of the transactions that we did in terms of closing, but there are those that say we did so much that they should have done it.
你知道我们完成了所有的交易，但有人说我们做得太多，他们本应该这样做的。

But I don't take, I'm happy because I saved millions of lives. Many millions of lives.
但我并没有，我很高兴因为我拯救了数百万人的生命。很多很多人的生命。

And speaking of somebody that saves lives, don't ever play golf with it because Keegan Bradley just walked in.
说到拯救生命的人，永远不要和他打高尔夫球，因为基根·布拉德利刚刚走了进来。

One of the greatest golfers in the world, the captain of the Ryder Cup.
他是世界上最伟大的高尔夫球手之一，莱德杯的队长。

And man, I'll tell you, you did a good job. You almost came back.
伙计，我告诉你，你做得很好。你差点就逆转了。

I turned on, I said, you know, I sort of turned off. It wasn't looking good. And then a little while later, I turned on.
我打开电视，我说，你知道，我有点关掉了。情况看起来不太好。然后过了一会儿，我又打开了。

I said, "You guys might make that," that would have been the miracle. What a great job.
我说：“你们可能做到，”那将是一个奇迹。干得真棒。

He's respected by those golfers like nobody. And I just want to compliment you, Keegan. There's an incredible job.
他受到了那些高尔夫球手前所未有的尊重。我只想赞扬你，基根。这真是不可思议的工作。

Right here, we have a lot of unfriendly fake news media. But and he's not used to that.
就在这里，我们有很多不友善的假新闻媒体。但他不习惯那样。

He's used to getting only good publicity. I think Harry, these are all golfers, but you're some golfer.
他习惯于只获得好的宣传。我想哈利，这些人都是高尔夫球手，但你是个很棒的高尔夫球手。

I'll tell you that. And some, some leader. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
我告诉你。还有，一个很棒的领导者。非常感谢。干得好。谢谢。

**Reporter:** Mr. on China.
**记者:** 先生，关于中国。

### 国内治安与功绩制度

**Reporter:** On immigration, ICE are making arrests, targeted arrests at courthouses in New York City and around the country.
**记者:** 关于移民问题，**ICE** (ICE: Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国国土安全部下属的执法机构，主要负责边境安全和移民执法)正在纽约市和全国各地的法院进行有针对性的逮捕。

Arresting criminals. That's right. Yeah. Go ahead.
逮捕罪犯。没错。是的。请继续。

I'm, I'm happy about it. I want them to arrest criminals.
我，我对此很高兴。我希望他们逮捕罪犯。

And if you take a look at DC, a year ago, DC was this, our great capital was a very unsafe place.
如果你看看华盛顿特区，一年前，华盛顿特区，我们伟大的首都，是一个非常不安全的地方。

You know that some of you were mugged and talk openly about it. Some of the media was mugged.
你们中有些人被抢劫过，而且公开谈论过。一些媒体人员也被抢劫过。

But right now DC is one of the safest places in the whole country.
但现在华盛顿特区是全国最安全的地方之一。

The restaurants are booming. They're opening up new restaurants. The restaurants were all closing.
餐馆生意兴隆。他们正在开新餐馆。以前餐馆都关门了。

Now you can't get into a restaurant. They're opening up new restaurants.
现在你连餐馆都进不去。他们正在开新餐馆。

It took 12 days for us. We sent in not politically correct military. We sent them in based on merit.
我们花了12天时间。我们派出了不是“政治正确”的军队。我们是根据**功绩制度** (Merit system: 一种基于个人能力、技能和成就而非政治关系或个人偏好来选拔和晋升的制度)派遣他们的。

You know, we won the case in the Supreme Court. Everything now is based on merit.
你知道，我们在最高法院赢得了这个案子。现在一切都基于功绩。

Our country was founded on things based on merit. Like Keegan Bradley is not going to be playing golf if he wasn't a great player.
我们的国家是建立在功绩基础上的。就像基根·布拉德利如果不是一个伟大的球员，他就不会打高尔夫球。

If he shoots lower scores, it's boy, there's no more merit system than that one. Keegan, right?
如果他打出更低的杆数，那就是，伙计，没有比这更功绩的系统了。基根，对吧？

You, if you miss a putt, you, they don't say, "Oh, that's okay, let's take it again," do they? No, it's based on merit.
你，如果你错失了一个推杆，他们不会说：“哦，没关系，再来一次”，对吧？不，那也是根据功绩来的。

Everything's based on merit. And we're back to the merit system.
一切都基于功绩。我们回到了功绩制度。

And when they saw that military, that military is all about merit, they're big, strong people that want to, they're patriots too.
当他们看到那支军队时，那支军队完全是关于功绩的，他们是高大强壮的人，他们想要，他们也是爱国者。

And you take a look at DC and now we're in Memphis and Memphis was really crime ridden.
你看看华盛顿特区，现在我们在孟菲斯，孟菲斯以前真的罪犯横行。

It was terrible. A lot of people being killed. And they say in 12 days, they can't even believe how much better it is.
情况很糟糕。很多人被杀。他们说，在12天内，他们简直不敢相信情况好转了多少。

And it'll take probably a month over there. And we're heading to Chicago because we want to save Chicago.
而且那里大概需要一个月的时间。我们正前往芝加哥，因为我们想拯救芝加哥。

Do you know they had over 4,000 people killed in Chicago over a short 4,000 people?
你知道吗，芝加哥在短时间内有超过4000人被杀？4000人？

And I have to watch this slob of a governor stand up and say that, "Well, everything's okay. We've got it under control."
我却不得不看着这位邋遢的州长站起来说：“嗯，一切都好。我们已经控制住了。”

They had 4,000 people murdered over a very short period of time.
在很短的时间内，有4000人被谋杀。

That's there's not a city in the world I don't believe that can claim, you know, you hear so much about different I won't, you know, embarrass anybody like by saying Mexico City or by saying anywhere in Afghanistan.
我相信世界上没有哪个城市能声称，你知道，你听到了很多关于不同的，我不会，你知道，通过提到墨西哥城或阿富汗任何地方来让任何人难堪。

There's no place like that. And then I have to listen to the mayor who's got a 5% approval rate, maybe less.
没有那样的地方。然后我不得不听市长的话，他的支持率只有5%，甚至更低。

He's an incompetent man. And the governor is an incompetent guy.
他是个无能的人。而州长也是个无能的家伙。

He's a guy that was thrown out of his family business like a dog. And it's I know his family very well.
他是个像狗一样被家族企业踢出来的人。而且我非常了解他的家人。

And now he's a governor. And when I watch him trying to say that it's okay, we have crime under control.
现在他成了州长。当我看到他试图说没关系，我们已经控制住犯罪时。

Lost 4,000 people over a very short period of time. Over, I believe it's like six, 7,000 people were shot but didn't die.
在很短的时间内失去了4000人。我相信大约有六七千人中枪但没有死亡。

But 4,000 people died. And then he gets up and talks about how it's not a problem. Or Portland, Oregon.
但有4000人死亡。然后他站起来谈论这根本不是问题。或者俄勒冈州的波特兰。

I mean, every time I look at that place, the place is burning down. There's fires all over the place.
我的意思是，每次我看到那个地方，它都在燃烧。到处都是火。

When a store owner, there are very few of them left, but when a store owner rebuilds a store, they build it out of plywood.
当一个店主（现在剩下的很少了）重建一家店时，他们用胶合板来建造。

And they don't put up storefronts anymore. They just put wood up because they know it's going to be ripped down.
他们不再安装店面。他们只是把木板钉上去，因为他们知道很快就会被拆掉。

And then I hear how wonderful it is. It's not wonderful. It's a disaster. That's almost an insurrection, that place.
然后我听到人们说它有多么美妙。一点也不美妙。那是一场灾难。那个地方几乎就是一场叛乱。

So, we put our people in there and they do the job. And they've really done the job.
所以，我们派我们的人去了那里，他们完成了任务。而且他们确实做到了。

And the beautiful thing is we've done it 12 days, we had this place safe and now it's, I would say within a month it was beautiful and it continues to be that was 3 months ago.
而美妙之处在于我们只用了12天，就让这个地方安全了，现在，我想说在一个月内它变得很美，而且持续至今，那已经是三个月前的事了。

I, I'll tell you DC now is one of the hottest places just like this country.
我，我告诉你，现在的华盛顿特区就像这个国家一样，是最热门的地方之一。

We were a dead country and you've heard me say it a hundred times. We're a dead country.
我们曾是一个死气沉沉的国家，你听我说了上百次。我们是一个死气沉沉的国家。

King of Saudi Arabia said it. Others say the Amir of Qatar said it. Many UAE said it, the leader, great leader, UAE, all great leaders, they said effectively the same thing.
沙特阿拉伯国王说过。其他人说卡塔尔埃米尔也说过。阿联酋很多人都说过，那位伟大的领导人，阿联酋，所有伟大的领导人都说过同样的话。

One year ago, we had a dead country. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world.
一年前，我们是一个死气沉沉的国家。现在我们是世界上最热门的国家。

### 国家复兴与阿斯利康投资

What a company you've built. You've been there a long time and done some job. It's an honor to have you.
你们建立了一家多么棒的公司。你们在那里工作了很长时间，并取得了一些成就。能有你们在场是我的荣幸。

I, I assume you're going to build so it's 4.5 billion for a plant. That's a pretty big plant, isn't it?
我，我猜你们会建造，所以一个工厂是45亿美元。那是个相当大的工厂，不是吗？

I was going to say, "Could he make it a little bit more?" Well, we have a couple of them where they're going to spend 65 billion on one plant.
我本来想说，“他能再多一点吗？”嗯，我们有几个项目，他们将在一个工厂上花费650亿美元。

You know, like **AI** (AI: Artificial Intelligence: 计算机科学领域，旨在创建能够模拟、甚至超越人类智能的机器), all I know is it's, you know, AI is based on information.
你知道，就像人工智能一样，我只知道，你知道，人工智能是基于信息的。

I hope they're right about information. I don't know. You got to make a lot of money to there's got to be a lot of information out there, but that seems to be pretty hot.
我希望他们在信息方面是正确的。我不知道。你必须赚很多钱，必须有大量信息在那里，但那看起来相当热门。

But we have a lot. We're, we're leading the world on information, on AI, as you know, by a lot. It's not even close.
但我们有很多。我们，我们知道，在信息和人工智能方面遥遥领先世界。根本没有接近的。

So, we're doing a job. And I want to thank everybody, but in particular, Pascal, thank you very much. It's a great honor. Thank you.
所以，我们正在努力。我想要感谢所有人，特别是帕斯卡，非常感谢你。这是巨大的荣幸。谢谢你。

Thank you everybody. Have a good time.
