### 播客开场：X平台上的实时对话

主持人首先对埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）能参加播客表示感谢，并提到他们两年前就开始尝试邀请他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi everyone and big thanks for taking the time on you know we've been trying to get you on the podcast since uh we started it two years ago so we are super pleased that we that we have you on and indeed on your xplatform how cool yeah</p>
</details>

马斯克表示，能在X平台（X Platform: 埃隆·马斯克收购并更名的社交媒体平台，原名Twitter）上进行实时播客非常酷，因为有来自世界各地的大量用户可以同时参与，而且效果非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh it's pretty cool yeah I mean you have like lots of people from all around the world uh simultaneously do effectively a realtime podcast and uh it works pretty well very good well we have so much to talk about</p>
</details>

### AI的飞速发展与未来展望

主持人随后将话题转向了人工智能（**AI**：Artificial Intelligence，人工智能），询问马斯克对当前AI竞赛的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh love to kick off with with AI um now what's your take on where we are in the AI race just now</p>
</details>

马斯克回应说，这是一个需要长篇大论的问题，因为AI是迄今为止他所见过的发展最快的技术，而且他见过很多技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">wow that's a long answer um there's there's so much happening in AI is the fastest advancing technology that I've ever seen of any kind and I've seen a lot of Technology</p>
</details>

他指出，几乎每周都有新的AI进展公布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know barely a week goes by with without some new announcement</p>
</details>

如果观察专门用于AI的硬件（即计算机）的上线数量，会发现它每年至少增长十倍，甚至每六到九个月就增长十倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so uh and if you look at the amount of uh AI Hardware the computers coming online that are dedicated to AI that is increasing what looks like at least by a factor of 10 every year if not every six to nine months</p>
</details>

将硬件的这种数量级增长（至少每九个月一次）与众多的软件突破结合起来看，这条发展曲线简直是“疯狂”的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when you combine the hardware um Coming online really order of magnitude increase every you know call at least every 9 months um and uh many many software breakthroughs uh if you look at that that curve it looks insane</p>
</details>

他猜测，到明年年底左右，AI将比任何一个人类都要聪明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think we'll um my my my guess is that we we'll have ai that is smarter than any any one human probably to around the end of next year um and then</p>
</details>

而AI的“感知计算”总量，他认为可能在五年内超越所有人类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI the total amount of sort of sentient compute of AI I think will probably exceed all humans in 5 years</p>
</details>

主持人问，当前的AI竞赛主要围绕什么展开？是算法、人才还是计算能力？是芯片供应吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what what is the what is the race about just now is it algorithms is it people is it computing power what what is it about just now is it the supply of chips just what is it</p>
</details>

马斯克解释说，去年主要是芯片供应受限，特别是英伟达（**Nvidia**：一家全球领先的图形处理器和人工智能计算公司）的芯片供不应求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah last year it was uh chip constraint um and the hardware deployment if you break it down into the three areas of people um data and hardware and starting with Hardware last year it was about a shift Supply people could not get enough um in video chips particularly</p>
</details>

今年则开始转向电压变压器（voltage transformer）的供应，即如何获得足够的电压变压器并将其安装到位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um this year it's starting to transition to a voltage Transformer Supply so actually getting enough voltage Transformers uh put in place</p>
</details>

他开玩笑说，这就像是“为Transformer（**Transformer模型**：一种深度学习模型架构，广泛应用于自然语言处理）准备变压器”，因为许多运行AI的模型都叫做Transformer，所以你需要变压器来运行Transformer。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so my sort of very Niche joke is Transformers for Transformers because a lot of the AI That's run is called a Transformer so you need Transformers to run Transformers</p>
</details>

再往后看一两年，或者说三年，限制因素将是电力供应。这些是硬件方面的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then next in the if you look out a year or two or certainly three years um it's just electricity availability so that's those those constraints in the hardware side</p>
</details>

在人才方面，世界上许多最聪明的人都在从事AI工作，甚至以前从事物理学研究的人也转向了AI，因为它是发展最快的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so many of the smart world's smartest people are are doing AI people that would have done physics before in fact or had have done physics for example have moved into AI because it's just the fastest moving field</p>
</details>

因此，我们看到大量顶尖人才和最聪明的人类投身AI领域，同时伴随着算法上的突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we're seeing a lot of the best talents a lot of the smartest humans going into Ai and then uh we see along with that algorithmic breakthroughs</p>
</details>

接着，你会遇到数据问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then then you start hitting the the wall with the the data problem um so</p>
</details>

马斯克指出，所有人类写过的书籍的文本内容，即使是压缩形式，也只能放在一个硬盘或一台电脑上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the you know you can fit all books ever written um just the text the the text in compressed form uh on one hard drive or call one one computer</p>
</details>

所以，当你考虑用于训练AI的所谓“tokens”时，即使是所有人类用所有语言写过的所有书籍，听起来很多，也远超任何一个人能读完的数量，但实际上，这只是一个很小的训练数据量，远远不够。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so when you when you're looking at like so called tokens to train on yeah uh and you you still think of like all the books ever written in every in in all languages by All Humans sounds like a lot certainly it's far more than any one human could could ever read um it actually is a small it's a small number of train training tokens it's just not enough</p>
</details>

因此，你必须开始考虑所有创建的视频、所有播客以及所有其他内容，但即使这样，数据也会用尽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so then you you start having to look at all the videos of I created um you know all the podcasts all the everything um and and you start even running out of data there</p>
</details>

主持人开玩笑说，希望这个播客也能被包含进去，马斯克肯定地回答说“肯定会”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well hopefully they hopefully they will include this podcast uh that definitely will include this podcast</p>
</details>

主持人询问，xAI（**xAI**：埃隆·马斯克创立的人工智能公司）面临的最大挑战是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the biggest challenge you have with uh with xai</p>
</details>

马斯克表示，xAI相对较新，目前的主要限制因素是训练他们的Grok v2模型（**Grok v2**：xAI开发的大型语言模型），他们认为这个模型应该会比GPT-4（**GPT-4**：Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4，开放AI公司开发的大型多模态模型）更优秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well xai is still relatively new so it's not um you know uh like the limiting factor right now is just training our Grok version 2 model which should be do we think better than GPD 4 um and that's we're hoping to complete that in May so that's that's training right now</p>
</details>

他们希望在五月份完成训练，所以目前只是努力获得足够的图形处理器（GPU）来尽快完成训练，他认为这很可能会实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's just really we're just trying to get enough gpus online to train it fast enough to get that done in May um which I think probably will happen um and</p>
</details>

这需要大约2万个H100（**H100**：英伟达推出的一款高性能GPU，专为AI和高性能计算设计）芯片，并且训练效率非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then and and that's with uh roughly 20,000 h100s uh and and doing I think very efficient training</p>
</details>

下一步是Grok v3（**Grok v3**：xAI开发的大型语言模型），它将需要10万个英伟达H100芯片进行连贯训练，这基本上是Grok v2训练量的五倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then the next step would be for Grok 3 which would be I guess G55 or Beyond uh would you know requires uh 100,000 Nvidia h100s training coherently so that's you know a half order of magnitude basically more training</p>
</details>

到那时，你将真正开始遇到数据问题，需要创建**合成数据**（Synthetic Data：人工生成的数据，用于训练AI模型）或使用真实世界的视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then you really start to have running into this data problem where you you have to either create synthetic data or use real world video</p>
</details>

这两种“无限数据”的来源是合成数据和真实世界视频，其中特斯拉（Tesla）在真实世界视频方面拥有巨大优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">those the the two sources of kind of like unlimited data are synthetic data and real world video which I should say Tesla has a pretty big advantage in real world video um Tesla has by far the most real world video of anyone yeah you've got a huge Library there</p>
</details>

主持人询问，马斯克认为何时能看到真正的**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence：通用人工智能）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when do you think so when do you think we'll see proper AGI</p>
</details>

马斯克回答说，这取决于你如何定义AGI。如果将其定义为比最聪明的人类更聪明，他认为可能在明年年底，也就是两年内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well it depends on how you define AGI if you define AGI as smarter than the smartest human I think it's probably end of next year like like within two years um but but that's that there's still there's still a pretty big leap beyond that to say smarter than the the machine augmented human Collective</p>
</details>

但要达到比机器增强的人类集体更聪明，即比所有协同工作并使用计算机增强其产出的人类更聪明，他认为可能还需要五年时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like is it smarter than all humans working together uh who are also using computers to augment their output and that that I think is probably five years away</p>
</details>

一种衡量方式是尝试评估数字计算与生物计算的大致比例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one one way to look at it is is is is to try to assess um like roughly what is the ratio of digital to biological compute</p>
</details>

### AI监管与“真相”的挑战

主持人提出了关于AI监管和其结构的新想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">last question on um on AI any new thoughts on regulation and um how it should be structured</p>
</details>

马斯克认为，我们可能确实需要某种监管机构来关注AI的安全性，就像我们在其他领域（如飞机、汽车和药物的安全性）有监管机构一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I I think we probably do need some sort of regulatory authority to look at the safety of AI um just as we have regulatory authorities and other Arenas to um you know o oversee aircraft and the safety of aircraft and cars and and other things you know medication so</p>
</details>

然而，AI的进步速度非常快，可能比任何监管机构都能跟上的速度都要快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh now the rate at which AI is progressing is is fast is faster than probably any regulatory agency can keep up with um</p>
</details>

但他对在实现安全AI之前非常重要的一点发表了评论：训练AI尽可能地真实，而不是政治正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but but I do have a comment on what I think is very important before achieving safe AI which is that uh it's very important to train the AI to be as truthful as possible um and not to uh yeah just to be as truthful as possible</p>
</details>

他认为，当你将AI编程为政治正确时，可能会出现非常危险的情况，这可能现在看起来相对无害，但如果AI拥有巨大权力，未来将不再如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I think you can get some very dangerous things when you program an AI to be politically correct think that things that may seem uh relatively innocuous now but will not be so in in the future if AI has immense power</p>
</details>

他举了谷歌Gemini（**Google Gemini**：谷歌开发的多模态大型语言模型）的例子，该模型拒绝生成白人乔治·华盛顿（George Washington）的图片，事实上，任何历史人物都会被自动“多样化”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can take the Google Gemini example where it it refused to publish to produce a picture of George Washington as a white man and and any in fact any historical figure would automatically be made diverse um because it's been programmed to insist on diversity</p>
</details>

这听起来可能一开始没问题，但如果AI拥有如此大的权力，以至于能够强制执行多样性，并决定某种人或某种性别过多，然后通过“杀死”足够多的人直到多样性数字达到其预设的“正确”标准，那就非常危险了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which sounds you know perhaps okay at first but not if the AI has so much power that it can actually enforce diversity and decide there's too many of one kind of people or too many of one sex and kill off just just kill off enough until the the diversity number is is what it's programmed to believe is correct</p>
</details>

主持人问，难道这个问题不会在下一个版本中得到解决吗？马斯克认为不会，他们只会让它变得更微妙、更不明显，但这种倾向仍然会存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but don't you think this will be sorted out in the next version no no they'll make it more subtle okay and less obvious but it will still be there</p>
</details>

主持人接着问，中国在AI方面相对于美国处于什么位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay well we'll see but where where is China where do you where is China now in I relative to the US</p>
</details>

马斯克表示，他不知道中国的具体情况，但中国有很多非常聪明的人，他们不会远远落后于世界其他地区或美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I I don't know exactly what China is uh except there are a lot of very smart people in China um and they they won't be they won't be far behind the rest of the world or far behind the US</p>
</details>

他提到，目前AI主要集中在旧金山和伦敦，中国也有很多事情发生，但他无法深入了解，不过他相信中国不会落后于西方的发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I mean the ai ai right now is very concentrated in San Francisco and London um and then you know there's there's you know a lot happening in in China but I I'm I don't have insight into what they're doing uh except that they I'm confident they will not be far behind uh what is developed in the west yeah</p>
</details>

他再次强调，如果我们不将AI编程为尽可能真实，那么危险就在于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so but but but mark my words the if if uh if we do not program an AI to be as truthful as possible that that is where it will go arai that is where the danger lies yeah</p>
</details>

### 电动汽车的未来与中国竞争

主持人将话题转向特斯拉（Tesla），询问电动汽车（**EV**：Electric Vehicle，电动汽车）的转型速度是否比他预期的慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mov moving T here moving to to Tesla um is is the EV conversion now going slower than you had expected just where is the speed of conversion now relative to your expectations</p>
</details>

马斯克认为，转型速度实际上相当快，尤其是在挪威。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's going quite fast actually especially Norway um absolutely well it's pretty much all there is is your your Teslas yeah there's a lot of Teslas in Norway it's crazy</p>
</details>

他再次感谢挪威对电动汽车的支持，并表示非常感激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thanks i' once again like to thank Norway for the support of electric vehicles um so much appreciated time so I think</p>
</details>

他相信所有车辆最终都会完全电动化，这只是时间问题，包括飞机和船只，当然还有火车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's we will the the that that electric that all vehicles will go fully electric uh it's only a matter of time um that includes aircraft ultimately and boats um obviously trains</p>
</details>

唯一讽刺的是，火箭很难电动化，因为你无法避免需要排出质量（根据牛顿第三定律）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the only thing that is ironically difficult to well you can't really make it electric is Rockets because you need you can't get away from um having to expel Mass uh you sort of Newton's third law</p>
</details>

但他坚信所有汽车都将是电动的，这只是时间问题，我们将像看待蒸汽机一样看待燃油车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but but all cars will be Electric it's only matter of time and we'll look back on combustion cause in the same way that we look at back on uh steam engines</p>
</details>

马斯克认为，内燃机汽车的出现是不可避免的，同样，汽车转向电动化也是不可避免的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um that that I was it was inevitable that there would be internal combustion cars and and it's just as inevitable that o cost will go electric</p>
</details>

虽然电动汽车的普及过程会有一些起伏，但最终的胜利是不可避免的，而且越早实现越好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and um there will be some e and you know so like it going to be a completely straight up line there will be some uh e and flow in how how far electric car is going but that but the ultimate um victory of electric cars is inevitable um and and I think the sooner we get there the better yeah</p>
</details>

主持人询问他对中国竞争的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you see the Chinese competition here</p>
</details>

马斯克表示，他们普遍认为中国公司是世界上最具竞争力的，尤其是在电动汽车或整个汽车行业，中国汽车公司无疑是最具竞争力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now we generally find that the companies in China are the most competitive in the world and certainly in uh electric vehicles or cars in general the Chinese car companies are by far the most competitive um yeah that's where where we find the most toughest toughest competitive challenges</p>
</details>

他认为中国公司制造出色的汽车，并且工作非常努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that they make great cars and they work very hard</p>
</details>

主持人问，作为一名工程师，马斯克乘坐中国汽车时有什么感受？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when you ride in one of the Chinese cars what do you think I mean you're an engineer you know what about it what do you what do you think</p>
</details>

马斯克说他最近没有乘坐过中国汽车，因为它们在美国并不普遍，在欧洲也只有少数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I haven't R I have not ridden in one lately but uh because they're not all available here you know in the US or very few are available in the US um some are available in Europe</p>
</details>

但他的团队告诉他，中国汽车非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but from what my team tells me there are very good</p>
</details>

### 火星殖民与文明的延续

主持人将话题转向太空，询问要实现火星自给自足需要什么条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving moving out out in space um what what would it take to be self-sufficient at Mars</p>
</details>

马斯克表示，火星自给自足的关键在于运送到火星表面的总吨位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to be self-sufficient in Mars it's really about the the total tonnage that is delivered to the surface of Mars um so you can say like well um</p>
</details>

他认为可能需要大约一百万吨，甚至可能更多，但在一百万到一千万吨之间，才能使火星实现自给自足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think it's probably on the order of a million tons maybe it maybe more but somewhere between probably a million tons and 10 million tons are needed to make Mars self-sufficient</p>
</details>

主持人问，这需要多少枚火箭？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how many Rockets is that</p>
</details>

马斯克提到他最近在SpaceX（**SpaceX**：埃隆·马斯克创立的航空航天制造商和太空运输服务公司）的演讲中谈到了这个问题。如果每次飞行能运载100吨，那么需要1万次飞行才能达到一百万吨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I gave a presentation on this recently if people look at my my recent uh SpaceX talk but if you if you have U really uh if you have 100 tons per flight you need 10,000 flights to get to a million million tons</p>
</details>

为了将100吨货物运到火星表面，你需要在地球轨道上准备五倍于此的燃料，因此需要大量的轨道加油。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and that's 100 tons landed to the surface of Mars so in order to get 100 tons land to the surface of Mars you need 500 five times that number in Earth orbit um so we do a lot of orbital refilling</p>
</details>

这意味着需要反复发射运载燃料的“油轮”火箭，为前往火星的飞船补充推进剂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so launching sort of uh Rockets uh tanker ships over and over again that that would replenish the propellant of the ships that would go to Mars</p>
</details>

为了达到一百万吨，大约需要1万次这样的飞行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then youd need a on roughly on order of 10,000 of them to get to a million tons um and</p>
</details>

他们计划在20年内完成这项任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh but we we plan to do that that that's uh that's we think we can get that done within 20 years really</p>
</details>

主持人问，那么第一次登陆火星大概在什么时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so and when do you think so when do you think we'll be there for the first time</p>
</details>

马斯克认为，第一艘登陆火星的**星舰**（Starship：SpaceX开发的可重复使用超重型运载火箭），最初肯定不会载人，可能在五年内实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">first first uh well the first Starship that will land on Mars which obviously would not not have people at first I think it's probably within about 5 years um</p>
</details>

然后可能会发射多艘飞船，确认它们能顺利在火星着陆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then it would probably launch several ships and just confirm that they can land okay on Mars</p>
</details>

他们也将同时进行月球任务，他认为五年内人类将重返月球，无人飞船将在五年内登陆火星。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um we'll also be doing the moon simultaneously with that so uh go taking well I think I think we'll get people back to the Moon I should say within 5 years and we'll get uh uncrewed ships landed on Ms within 5 years</p>
</details>

之后，他们将提高生产速度，并改进助推器和飞船的设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and then we be building up the production rate um and improving the design of the booster in the ship so</p>
</details>

他认为，第一批人类登陆火星可能在七到九年内实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so in the first people on Mars I think within seven years or so seven to nine years um</p>
</details>

从那时起，需要迅速增加飞船数量，因为地球和火星大约每两年才有六个月的时间处于太阳系的同一象限，或者说，每26个月只有几个月是理想的转移窗口。

</details>

如果我们希望最大化意识的寿命，那么成为一个多行星物种将比只在一个行星上生活更能延长意识的存在。

<p class="english-text">you don't think it' be better to use all these resources and try to sort out Earth</p>
</details>

主持人问，难道不应该把所有这些资源用于解决地球上的问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well just to put this into perspective the amount of resources I'm talking about for making life multiplanetary would be less than 1% of all resources on Earth</p>

因此，这可以看作是资源分配问题：你认为是否值得花费地球0.5%的资源来确保意识的冗余，并将意识从火星扩展到其他行星，最终扩展到其他恒星系统？

</details>

人们可能会说存在一些错误信息或虚假信息，但他认为，看看回复和**社区笔记**（Community Notes：X平台的一项事实核查功能，允许用户对信息添加背景说明），它们纠正了这些错误信息，社区笔记的“击球率”非常高，是互联网上最好的事实核查系统。

</details>

马斯克解释说，他们不断收到来自**亚历山大·德·莫赖斯法官**（Judge Alexandre de Moraes：巴西最高法院大法官）的要求，要求立即暂停某些账户，通常只有两小时的执行时间，否则将面临巨额罚款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

</details>

最终，他们收到了暂停现任议员和主要记者账户的要求，更重要的是，他们不能告诉这些用户这是应亚历山大·德·莫赖斯（Alexander Morales）的要求，而必须假装是由于X平台的服务条款。这是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，他们拒绝了。

马斯克表示，他知道这不会是一帆风顺的。他认为，既然他们正在努力追求成为互联网上最准确和真实的地方，这并不意味着所说的一切都总是真实或准确，但或许可以将其视为互联网上“最不准确”的地方。

<p class="english-text">um but overall we're trying to serve the people of Earth um and and and and this is sort of an S sort of maybe an esic way of viewing it but um to try to be kind of like the the group consciousness of Earth so you can think of like if each person is like a neuron contributing to like the collective brain of Earth and you want to try to minimize the noise and maximize the signal of every neuron that's connected to the the X Network that that's basically what what is what is the collective will of of humanity and and how and and and and how to yeah just serve the collective will of humanity and so serve the greater good that that's our goal</p>
</details>

但总的来说，他们正在努力服务地球上的人们。这可能是一种有点深奥的看法，但他们试图成为地球的集体意识。你可以想象每个人都是一个神经元，为地球的集体大脑做出贡献，他们希望最小化噪音，最大化连接到X网络的每个神经元的信号，这基本上就是人类的集体意志，以及如何服务于人类的集体意志和更大的利益，这是他们的目标。

所以他觉得可以尝试一些完全疯狂的东西，比如《银翼杀手》（Blade Runner）会开什么样的卡车。它可能不被所有人喜欢，但它激进、新颖，在美学上不是模仿品，与路上其他任何车辆都不同，而其他皮卡看起来都像是彼此的模糊复制品。

马斯克认为大多数博士论文是无用的，从客观上看确实如此。如果你看看每年有多少博士学位被授予，以及这些论文中有多少真正被应用到任何实际事物中，那么客观上大多数博士论文的实用性非常低，甚至为零，因为没有人使用它们。
