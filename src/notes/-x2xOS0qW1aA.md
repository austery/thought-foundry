### 集会现场：选民心声

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

So, what I am staring at is a line of people waiting to get inside Zohran Mamdani’s campaign rally here in Washington Heights. It’s now 6:00 p.m. on Monday night, October 13th. It’s hard to explain just how big this line is. It literally spans three and a half blocks and it is dense. And we are going to talk to people in this line and inside this rally about what Mamdani means to them.

我眼前是一长队人，正排队进入卓兰·马姆达尼在华盛顿高地举行的竞选集会。现在是10月13日星期一晚上6点。这条队伍有多长很难解释清楚，它绵延了足足三个半街区，而且非常密集。我们将采访队伍中的人们和集会内部的参与者，了解马姆达尼对他们意味着什么。

**Speaker:** Let's go.

**发言人:** 我们走。

**Michael Barbaro:** We’re from the show called The Daily.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我们是《每日》节目的记者。

**Speaker:** Oh, hello.

**发言人:** 哦，你好。

**Michael Barbaro:** Hi. And we’re just going to ask people in a word what Mamdani means to you, what he represents.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 嗨。我们想简单问问大家，用一个词来形容，马姆达尼对你意味着什么，他代表着什么？

**Speaker:** One word.

**发言人:** 一个词？

**Michael Barbaro:** Yeah, why not?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 是啊，为什么不呢？

**Speaker:** Compassion. Honest person.

**发言人:** 同情心。正直的人。

**Speaker:** He’s real.

**发言人:** 他很真实。

**Speaker:** He’s brown and I’m brown.

**发言人:** 他是棕色人种，我也是棕色人种。

**Speaker:** That simple.

**发言人:** 就这么简单。

**Speaker:** That simple.

**发言人:** 就这么简单。

**Speaker:** Yeah.

**发言人:** 是的。

**Speaker:** Hope.

**发言人:** 希望。

**Speaker:** Hope. My first choice would be hope and then the future.

**发言人:** 希望。我的首选是希望，其次是未来。

**Speaker:** I think he is a fresh and actual change in the party.

**发言人:** 我认为他是党内一股新鲜而真正的变革力量。

**Speaker:** I’m 16 years old and from what I’ve heard, I’ve been volunteering under Zohran, and apparently, according to adults, it’s really rare to be happy or excited about a politician. So, this is kind of a once-in-a-lifetime thing.

**发言人:** 我16岁了，据我所知，我一直在卓兰手下做志愿者。显然，据大人们说，对一个政客感到高兴或兴奋是很少见的。所以，这有点像一生一次的经历。

**Speaker:** I’m here because my son actually introduced me to him. I didn’t know anything about him. I was talking to him one day and I said, you know, I may just vote for Cuomo because I thought it was Cuomo and Adams. He’s like, “You didn’t hear about Zohran?” And I said, “No.” He sent me a couple of videos, and I liked what he had to offer.

**发言人:** 我来这里是因为我儿子把我介绍给他的。我之前对他一无所知。有一天我和儿子聊天，我说，你知道吗，我可能只会投票给科莫，因为我以为只有科莫和亚当斯可选。他说：“你没听说过卓兰吗？”我说：“没有。”他给我发了一些视频，我喜欢他提出的东西。

**Michael Barbaro:** So much so that you’re here at his rally.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 以至于你现在来参加他的集会了。

**Speaker:** Yes, and I’ve been canvassing for him for the past three weeks.

**发言人:** 是的，实际上过去三周我一直在为他拉票。

**Speaker:** We’re also very excited about his position on Palestine and what’s going on. I’m an **反犹太复国主义者** (anti-Zionist: 批评或反对犹太复国主义意识形态的个体或群体) Jewish girl, and I think it’s really important that people see that perspective, right?

**发言人:** 我们也对他在巴勒斯坦问题上的立场和当前的局势感到非常兴奋。我是一名反犹太复国主义的犹太女孩，我认为人们看到这种观点非常重要，对吧？

**Speaker:** Finally, some movement away from centrist pandering to oligarchic fascists. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I just feel like it’s very necessary for us to have places in this country that are very openly progressive and are not bending to the will of what the president wants and what he represents.

**发言人:** 终于，我们看到了摆脱中间派对寡头法西斯主义者谄媚的趋势。毫不夸张地说，我只是觉得我们这个国家非常需要一些公开进步、不屈服于总统意愿和其所代表价值观的地方。

**Speaker:** As a working-class person, this is a very exciting moment for us. Someone is thinking about us, someone is committed to working for us.

**发言人:** 作为工薪阶层，这对我们来说是一个非常激动人心的时刻。有人在为我们着想，有人致力于为我们工作。

**Speaker:** We’re about to raise a family. We don’t want to be priced out. I mean, I don’t want to be presumptuous, but free childcare for all.

**发言人:** 我们即将组建家庭。我们不想被高价逼走。我的意思是，我不想妄加猜测，但希望所有人都能享有免费托儿服务。

**Michael Barbaro:** You’re pregnant.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 你怀孕了。

**Speaker:** Very much so.

**发言人:** 是的，非常。

**Michael Barbaro:** How many months?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 几个月了？

**Speaker:** Eight.

**发言人:** 八个月。

**Michael Barbaro:** We were just talking about that to you as well.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我们刚才也在和你谈论这个问题。

**Speaker:** It very much is. Yeah.

**发言人:** 确实如此。是的。

**Speaker:** Zohran will help us freeze the rent, faster buses, free buses, cheaper groceries, and childcare, and help families.

**发言人:** 卓兰会帮助我们冻结租金，加快公交速度，实现公交免费，降低食品杂货价格，提供托儿服务，并帮助家庭。

**Michael Barbaro:** All right. Wow. Thank you for your help.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 好的。哇。谢谢你的帮助。

**Speaker:** People know this platform like they know the back of their hands.

**发言人:** 人们对这个纲领了如指掌。

**Speaker:** Ladies and gentlemen, come on down. Come on in. And now we go to security. They’ll check you in.

**发言人:** 女士们先生们，请下来，请进来。现在我们去安检。他们会为你们办理手续。

**Michael Barbaro:** So, we’re inside this auditorium now, which has a capacity of about 3,500 people, and it very much feels like it’s at capacity.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我们现在身处这个礼堂，它大约能容纳3500人，感觉已经座无虚席了。

**Speaker:** I need to introduce the next mayor of the city of New York, Zohran.

**发言人:** 我要介绍一下下一任纽约市市长，卓兰。

**Michael Barbaro:** After a very long wind-up and a bunch of introductory speeches, Mamdani is now finally taking the stage.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 在漫长的铺垫和一系列介绍性演讲之后，马姆达尼终于登上了舞台。

[Applause]

[掌声]

**Zohran Mamdani:** Billionaires like **比尔·阿克曼** (Bill Ackman: 美国对冲基金经理) and Ronald Lauder have poured millions of dollars into this race because they say that we pose an existential threat. And I am here to admit something: they are right. Fundamental change only comes from the courage to turn your back on the old formulas, the courage to invent the future together. That is exactly what we have done. Because for all those who say our time is coming, my friends, our time is now.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 像比尔·阿克曼和罗纳德·劳德这样的亿万富翁已经为这场竞选投入了数百万美元，因为他们说我们构成了生存威胁。我在这里承认一件事：他们是对的。根本性的改变，只有通过勇敢地背弃旧模式、勇敢地共同创造未来才能实现。这正是我们所做的。因为对于所有说我们时代将至的人，我的朋友们，我们的时代就是现在。

### 马姆达尼的政治身份与理念

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Okay, so the rally is now over. The crowd is spilling out onto the streets of Washington Heights and the next stop for us is Mamdani’s campaign headquarters in Manhattan where we are going to sit down with him for an interview. From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, Zohran Mamdani on the movement he’s created in New York City, his critique of the Democratic Party, his courtship of those he has alienated with his campaign so far, and his plans to stand up to Donald Trump. It’s Thursday, October 16th.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 好的，集会现在结束了。人群正涌向华盛顿高地的街道，我们的下一站是曼哈顿的马姆达尼竞选总部，我们将在那里与他进行一次采访。我是《纽约时报》的迈克尔·巴巴罗。这里是《每日》节目。今天，我们将探讨卓兰·马姆达尼在纽约市发起的运动、他对民主党的批判、他如何争取那些迄今为止被他的竞选活动疏远的人，以及他对抗唐纳德·特朗普的计划。今天是10月16日星期四。

**Michael Barbaro:** Hello.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 你好。

**Speaker:** Hey, we’re here to go to the Mamdani campaign headquarters. How’s this going? Can they come?

**发言人:** 嘿，我们来马姆达尼竞选总部了。进展如何？他们能来吗？

**Speaker:** Yeah.

**发言人:** 可以。

**Speaker:** Oh, they’ll come pick us up. Okay, I’ll text them. You’re welcome.

**发言人:** 哦，他们会来接我们。好的，我发短信给他们。不客气。

**Speaker:** Oh, there’s Assemblyman Mamdani.

**发言人:** 哦，那是州议员马姆达尼。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Hello. How are you?

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 你好。你好吗？

**Michael Barbaro:** Hello. How’s it going? Pleasure to meet you. It’s such a pleasure.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 你好。一切顺利吗？很高兴见到你。真是荣幸。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Hi.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 嗨。

**Speaker:** Nice to meet you.

**发言人:** 很高兴见到你。

**Speaker:** Do you mind helping me? The third floor, which we sometimes stop at, has these Halloween decorations that always take you a little bit back.

**发言人:** 你介意帮我一下吗？我们有时会停在三楼，那里有万圣节装饰，总是让人有点吃惊。

**Michael Barbaro:** Is this your office?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 这是你的办公室吗？

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yeah.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的。

**Michael Barbaro:** Okay.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 好的。

**Michael Barbaro:** Oh, wow.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 哦，哇。

**Zohran Mamdani:** To call it modest would be an injustice to the word modest.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 如果说它“简朴”，那简直是对“简朴”这个词的侮辱。

**Michael Barbaro:** Modest is...

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 简朴是……

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yeah, you can sit in that chair. The recliner.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的，你可以坐那把椅子。那把躺椅。

**Michael Barbaro:** Okay, we’re going. Assemblyman, do people call you Assemblyman?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 好的，我们开始吧。议员先生，人们都叫你议员吗？

**Zohran Mamdani:** Some people do. You can call me Zohran.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 有些人会。你可以叫我卓兰。

**Michael Barbaro:** That’s a little familiar. Assemblyman Mamdani, thank you for making time for us and thank you for inviting us to your rally last night.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 那有点太亲近了。议员马姆达尼，感谢您抽出时间接受我们的采访，也感谢您昨晚邀请我们参加您的集会。

**Zohran Mamdani:** You’re very welcome. It’s a pleasure to be here.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 非常欢迎。很高兴来到这里。

**Michael Barbaro:** So, you sit, according to the polls, including our own at The Times, on the cusp of a historic political victory, because at the age of, well, you’re now 33, but you’ll be 34 just a couple days after this runs. You would be the youngest mayor in a century. You’d be New York City’s first Muslim mayor. You’d be its first Democratic Socialist mayor.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 那么，根据包括我们《泰晤士报》在内的民意调查，您正处于一场历史性政治胜利的边缘，因为您现在33岁，但几天后就会满34岁。您将成为一个世纪以来最年轻的市长。您将是纽约市第一位穆斯林市长。您也将是第一位民主社会主义市长。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Well, I wouldn’t actually be the first Democratic socialist mayor.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 嗯，实际上我不会是第一位民主社会主义市长。

**Michael Barbaro:** Who would it be? David Dinkins was also a member of the Democratic Socialists. A co-member of the Democratic Party on the right. Is that it?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 那会是谁？大卫·丁金斯也是民主社会主义者的一员。是民主党右翼的共同成员吗？是这样吗？

**Zohran Mamdani:** Well, he was a member of **DSA** (Democratic Socialists of America: 美国民主社会主义者组织), identified also as a Democratic Socialist.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 嗯，他是美国民主社会主义者组织（DSA）的成员，也自认为是民主社会主义者。

**Michael Barbaro:** Interesting. Thank you for the correction. Unaware.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 有趣。谢谢您的纠正。我不知道。

**Michael Barbaro:** You’d be the second Democratic Socialist mayor after David Dinkins. And I’d like for this conversation to trace the arc of how you got to this moment, the forces, the ideas that made you the candidate that first got into this race, the style of the campaign that transformed you from being, I think it’s safe to say, virtually unknown into the winner of the primary for the Democratic nomination, and the way since that you have tried to broaden your appeal, answer your skeptics in this general election, and finally, of course, what it will look like if you do become mayor. And somehow we’re going to do that in an hour.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您将是大卫·丁金斯之后第二位民主社会主义市长。我希望这次对话能追溯您是如何走到这一步的，塑造您成为最初参选人的力量和思想，以及将您从一个可以说几乎无人知晓的人物，转变为民主党初选获胜者的竞选风格。此外，还有您自那时以来如何努力扩大吸引力，在这次大选中回应质疑者，当然，最后是如果您真的成为市长，情况会是怎样。而我们将在一个小时内完成这一切。

**Michael Barbaro:** You grew up the son of a well-known filmmaker. Your mother directed Denzel Washington, even *Mississippi Masala*. Your father was a college professor who studied, among other things, apartheid and genocide. As a young man, you became a college activist. You’re focused on progressive politics. And when you graduate from college and start your career in the progressive world, you start to identify not as a Democrat, but as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. And given your bio, being a Democrat feels like it would have been a pretty natural home. So just let me start by asking about what went into that decision, what you were embracing and what you were rejecting in that identification.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您成长于一位知名电影制作人的家庭。您的母亲曾执导丹泽尔·华盛顿出演的电影，甚至包括《密西西比马萨拉》。您的父亲是一位大学教授，研究过种族隔离和种族灭绝等议题。年轻时，您成为一名大学活动家，专注于进步政治。大学毕业后，您在进步领域开启职业生涯，开始将自己定位为美国民主社会主义者组织的成员，而非仅仅是民主党人。鉴于您的个人背景，成为一名民主党人似乎是个非常自然的归宿。那么，请允许我先问问，做出这个决定时，您考虑了什么，您拥抱了什么，又拒绝了什么？

**Zohran Mamdani:** So I wouldn’t describe those two identities as mutually exclusive. I think that one can live within the other, meaning that I am both a democratic socialist and I’m also a Democrat. One is a description of my political ideology. The other is a description of the party that I belong to.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我不会将这两种身份描述为相互排斥的。我认为它们可以并存，也就是说，我既是民主社会主义者，也是民主党人。一种是描述我的政治意识形态，另一种是描述我所属的政党。

**Michael Barbaro:** **DSA** being the ideology,

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 美国民主社会主义者组织是意识形态，

**Zohran Mamdani:** **民主社会主义** (Democratic Socialism: 一种政治意识形态，主张通过民主手段实现社会主义目标，通常强调社会福利、平等和公共服务) being the ideology, DSA being an organization, the Democratic Party being the party. And it was Bernie Sanders’s run in 2016 that gave me the language of democratic socialism to describe my own politics. It took what I had thought were disparate ideas and cohered them and gave me an understanding of what that politics was and also what a larger movement looked like of people who also were animated by that same focus on dignity, on the unacceptable nature of income inequality across this country.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 民主社会主义是意识形态，美国民主社会主义者组织是一个组织，民主党是一个政党。正是伯尼·桑德斯在2016年的竞选，给了我民主社会主义的语言来描述我自己的政治。它将我原以为是互不相关的想法整合起来，让我理解了这种政治是什么，以及一个更宏大的运动是怎样的——这个运动中的人们也同样关注尊严，关注这个国家不可接受的收入不平等。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And to me, what democratic socialism means is a belief that it is government’s job to ensure that every person is living a life of dignity. And dignity is not the things that you’d like. It’s not the things that you’d want. It’s the things that you need. And there’s a general common sense around many of those things. You know, in New York City, in this country, we’d say that every child deserves public education that’s free point of service of K through 12. But we also think that it’s okay to be priced out of the education you need prior to that, childcare.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 对我来说，民主社会主义意味着一种信念，即政府的职责是确保每个人都能过上有尊严的生活。而尊严并非你喜欢的东西，也非你想要的东西，而是你必需的东西。对于许多这些必需品，社会上存在普遍的共识。你知道，在纽约市，在这个国家，我们会说每个孩子都应该获得从幼儿园到高中免费的公共教育。但我们也认为，在那之前的学前教育和托儿服务，即使被高价排除在外也无妨。

**Michael Barbaro:** And for some reason, there’s a point at which you should deserve education. Then there’s a point before that at which it depends on your family’s ability to pay.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 而出于某种原因，在某个时间点，你理应获得教育。但在那之前，它却取决于你的家庭是否有能力支付。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Right. And it’s somewhat arbitrary. Yes. And the ability to pay is not a nominal amount. We’re talking about an average generally of $22,500 a year for a 3-year-old or a 4-year-old or a 2-year-old. And so to me, what democratic socialism is the fulfillment of the ideal that underpins things that already exist within our society but are currently being applied in either a partial manner or not at all. So democratic socialism gives you a vocabulary to identify those injustices, those inequities and say they don’t need to be. And it teaches me that the way I feel about housing and the way I feel about public transit and the way I feel about childcare, these are not different opinions necessarily. They are in fact rooted in the same understanding of the world we should be living in.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 对。而且这多少有些随意。是的。而支付能力并非一个象征性的数字。我们谈论的是一个普遍平均每年22500美元的费用，针对一个3岁、4岁或2岁的孩子。因此，对我来说，民主社会主义是实现我们社会中已经存在但目前只被部分应用或根本未被应用的理想。所以民主社会主义为你提供了一套词汇，去识别那些不公和不平等，并指出它们并非必然存在。它告诉我，我对住房、公共交通和托儿服务的看法，不一定只是不同的观点。实际上，它们都植根于我们应该生活的这个世界的相同理解。

### 对传统民主党的批判：以科莫为例

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Democrats talk about many of the things that you just identified have for quite some time, right? Childcare, healthcare, affordability. And I think it’s fair to say that, and this I think was on display at your rally last night, that you have some real objections to the way traditional Democrats have operated. And I want to get to the heart of that where you think the distinction lies between the problems you’re identifying and want to solve, the vision for solving it, and what the existing Democratic Party’s view of those things are, because you don’t mince words about old ways, old formulas and a kind of sclerotic Democratic Party that you see your movement as not just changing but maybe fully replacing.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 民主党人谈论您刚才提到的许多问题已经有一段时间了，对吧？托儿服务、医疗保健、可负担性。我认为公平地说，而且这在您昨晚的集会上也得到了体现，您对传统民主党人的运作方式确实存在一些异议。我想深入探讨这一点，您认为您所识别并希望解决的问题、解决问题的愿景，以及现有民主党对这些问题的看法之间的区别在哪里，因为您毫不讳言地谈论旧方式、旧模式，以及您认为您的运动不仅要改变，甚至可能完全取代的某种僵化的民主党。

**Zohran Mamdani:** You know, in this race right now, it’s easy to view one of my opponents, Andrew Cuomo, through the caricature that he is creating of himself. But prior to this moment, he was considered by many to be a leader in the Democratic Party, one of the most prominent Democrats to emerge from this state, at a point someone that people were speaking about as a politician who should run for president of this country.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 你知道，在这次竞选中，现在很容易通过安德鲁·科莫自己塑造的讽刺形象来看待他这位对手。但在此时之前，他被许多人认为是民主党内的领导者，是该州涌现出的最杰出的民主党人之一，甚至一度有人说他应该竞选美国总统。

**Michael Barbaro:** I remember.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我记得。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And he is an example of so much of what has disappointed so many about our party because for all that he is today, there have been examples of this in years past. And these were the very things that we would overlook or we would simply see as parts of what politics had to be.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 他就是我们党让许多人失望的众多事例之一，因为尽管他如今声名狼藉，但过去几年里已经有类似的例子。而这些正是我们过去常常忽视，或者简单地认为是政治必然组成部分的事情。

**Michael Barbaro:** Get specific about it if you don’t mind, because I think there are plenty of New Yorkers who see an Andrew Cuomo—putting aside, which for many is impossible, the allegations of sexual misconduct—a governor who used his platform to remake **拉瓜迪亚机场** (LaGuardia Airport: 纽约市三大机场之一), to build **莫伊尼汉车站** (Moynihan Station: 纽约市的一个火车站), and to pass gay marriage, who used the Democratic Party and its values to create pretty substantial change.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 如果您不介意，请具体说说，因为我认为有很多纽约人，撇开对许多人来说难以做到的性行为不端指控不谈，他们看到的是一位利用其平台改造拉瓜迪亚机场、建造莫伊尼汉车站、通过同性婚姻的州长，他利用民主党及其价值观带来了相当大的改变。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And he’s the same governor who ensured that there would be Republican power in Albany such that the only progress that would be made was that which he was willing to accept. Many of the same achievements that are accredited to him are the ones that he was initially an obstacle towards before becoming seen as the architect of. Thinking about this as the same person who cut funding for a program called **优势计划** (Advantage Program: 旨在帮助无家可归者获得住房的纽约州项目) that was providing millions of dollars in connecting homeless New Yorkers with apartments that they could live in. And I actually met a woman right here in New York City who had just been approved to that program right before the funding was cut. And the cutting of that funding was one that then pushed her out of the apartment that she was able to rent.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 他也是那位确保奥尔巴尼会有共和党势力的州长，这样一来，唯一能取得的进展就是他愿意接受的。许多归功于他的成就，在他被视为“设计师”之前，他最初是其障碍。想想看，正是这个人削减了一个名为“优势计划”的项目的资金，该计划曾投入数百万美元，帮助无家可归的纽约人获得住房。我实际上在纽约市遇到一位女士，她刚刚获得该项目的批准，资金就被削减了。而正是这次资金削减，将她赶出了她原本能够租住的公寓。

**Zohran Mamdani:** This is the same governor who gave Elon Musk $959 million in tax credits in New York.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 这位州长还曾给予埃隆·马斯克在纽约9.59亿美元的税收抵免。

**Michael Barbaro:** In New York.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 在纽约。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I say these things because sometimes it’s tempting to think that all that is wrong in this moment is from Donald Trump. But it’s important that the very same people that we have villainized and thought of solely through the prism of Trump existed prior to him and in fact were some of the very people that were uplifted by these kinds of leaders within the Democratic Party. If you want to understand why so many have come to associate politics with an extended play of diminishing faith and trust, then we also have to understand who the politicians have been that have been leading these very parties and that many of these issues are not exclusive to the Republican Party. They are in fact endemic within our own party. And if we want to truly move beyond Donald Trump, we also have to understand the systems that allowed for the flourishing of someone like Donald Trump and that many of those systems and styles of politics are also within our own party, Andrew Cuomo being an example of the fusion of these things.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我说这些是因为有时人们很容易认为当前所有的问题都源于唐纳德·特朗普。但重要的是，我们妖魔化并仅仅通过特朗普棱镜来看待的那些人，在他之前就已存在，实际上，他们正是民主党内部这类领导人所推崇的人。如果你想理解为什么这么多人会将政治与不断消减的信仰和信任联系起来，那么我们也必须了解一直领导这些政党的政客是谁，以及这些问题中的许多并非共和党独有。事实上，它们在我们自己的党内也普遍存在。如果我们真的想超越唐纳德·特朗普，我们也必须理解那些允许像唐纳德·特朗普这样的人繁荣发展的制度，以及许多这类制度和政治风格也存在于我们自己的党内，安德鲁·科莫就是这些因素融合的一个例子。

**Michael Barbaro:** So just to distill this critique, Democrats like Cuomo make big progressive promises. When the rubber meets the road, in your mind, they will cave to the other side, to the elites, to the donor class. They ultimately disappoint on questions like affordability, and you’re saying you will not do that. You will not disappoint.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 那么，总结一下这个批判，像科莫这样的民主党人会做出宏大的进步承诺。但在您看来，当真正需要行动时，他们会向对方妥协，向精英阶层妥协，向捐助阶层妥协。他们在可负担性等问题上最终令人失望，而您说您不会那样做。您不会让人失望。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yes.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的。

**Michael Barbaro:** That’s the idea.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 想法就是这样。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yes.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的。

**Michael Barbaro:** Why do you think that they make compromises that you, not yet mayor, not governor, and not having to work with the other side, are so certain you will never make?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您为什么认为他们会做出妥协，而您——一个尚未成为市长或州长，也无需与对方合作的人——却如此确信自己永远不会做出这种妥协？

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’ve heard about these pauses.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我听说过这些停顿。

**Michael Barbaro:** It’s interesting. Well, you think…

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 有趣。嗯，你认为……

**Zohran Mamdani:** It’s interesting to hear you say the word “the other side.” Part of my point is that Andrew Cuomo created the other side in Albany. He took what would have otherwise been a **民主党三连冠** (democratic trifecta: 指一个政党同时控制州长办公室、州参议院和州众议院) 的局面——民主党控制州长办公室、州众议院和州参议院——并确保参议院中存在一个拥有权力的共和党少数派。我们谈论的有点内部化了，但在纽约，安德鲁·科莫几乎需要、想要、并受益于一种权力分散，这种分散制约了纽约的民主党人，坦率地说也制约了进步派。

**Michael Barbaro:** Exactly. And I share this example. It’s almost like you spent some time in Albany. As inside baseball as it is, but I think that’s clearly because he feared an unchecked left or a left that would actually be able to deliver. And God forbid an unchecked left that was able to fulfill the aspirations of working people. And I say this because governing will necessitate compromise. There’s no question about that. Some of the compromises that have been made, however, are not the ones that are actually innate to these positions and to this politics. Some of them have actually been created as a means by which to ensure that we could never fulfill the ideals that have brought so many to politics. And the reason I am confident in my ability to deliver on what we have campaigned on is because of the fact that we have campaigned on a very specific set of commitments. I would argue that far more than many other campaigns, New Yorkers know exactly what it is that I’m running on. I’ll have people stop me in the street and just shout, “Fast and free buses!” or “Universal childcare!” or “Freeze the rent!”

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 没错。我分享这个例子。这几乎就像你在奥尔巴尼待过一段时间一样。虽然这有点像行话，但我认为这显然是因为他害怕一个不受制约的左派，或者一个真正能够兑现承诺的左派。天哪，一个不受制约的左派竟然能够实现劳动人民的愿望。我之所以这么说，是因为执政必然需要妥协。这一点毋庸置疑。然而，一些妥协并非这些职位和这种政治固有的。其中一些实际上是为了确保我们永远无法实现那些将如此多人带入政治的理想而创造出来的。我之所以对兑现我们竞选时的承诺充满信心，是因为我们竞选时提出了一系列非常具体的承诺。我认为，与许多其他竞选活动相比，纽约人非常清楚我竞选的纲领是什么。人们会在街上拦住我，大喊“快速免费公交！”或者“全民托儿！”或者“冻结租金！”

**Zohran Mamdani:** And that means that we’re building a movement not around an individual but rather around these policy commitments. And that is what we will be held to account for. And that is something that I want because in order to bring people back to politics, in order to bring people’s faith back to the idea that government could actually make their lives easier, we have to be honest about what it is we’re fighting for, who we’re fighting for, and then to deliver on those very things.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 这意味着我们正在围绕这些政策承诺，而不是围绕个人，来建立一场运动。这就是我们将要为此负责的。这也是我想要的，因为为了让人们重新关注政治，为了让人们重新相信政府真的能让他们的生活更轻松，我们必须诚实地说明我们为何而战，为谁而战，然后去实现这些目标。

### 政策立场与务实主义

**Michael Barbaro:** I want to go back for just a moment to a timeline when you’re kind of working your way from progressive causes into politics. Clearly, you’re inspired at this phase by Senator Bernie Sanders, this movement, this campaign he’s created. You run for state assembly in 2020, a really big year in American civil discourse, politics, and I wonder if you’d agree with this. It feels to me, looking back at that period, that you’re very much straddling the line still between an activist and a political candidate. People who may someday run for mayor of New York City, for instance, tend not to go on social media and write things. And you know this tweet, and I know it gets brought up. I think it’s fair game when you wrote in 2020, “We don’t need an investigation to know that the **纽约市警察局** (NYPD: New York City Police Department: 纽约市的警务部门) is racist, anti-queer, a major threat to public safety.” You call for **削减纽约市警察局经费** (defunding the NYPD: 减少警察部门的预算，并将资金重新分配给其他社区服务)。人们会认为您是一个反锡安主义者。过去，这些言论可能会被视为不合格的。但在您这个案例中显然没有发生。但我很好奇，当时是什么促使您表达这些观点，特别是关于警方的？

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我想暂时回到您从进步事业逐步迈入政坛的时间线。显然，在这个阶段，您受到了参议员伯尼·桑德斯及其所创建的运动和竞选的启发。您在2020年竞选州议员，那是美国民事话语和政治领域非常重要的一年，我不知道您是否同意这一点。在我看来，回顾那个时期，您仍然非常游走于活动家和政治候选人之间。例如，那些将来可能竞选纽约市市长的人，通常不会在社交媒体上写下这样的言论。您知道这条推文，我也知道它经常被提及。我认为您在2020年写道：“我们不需要调查就知道纽约市警察局是种族主义的、反同性恋的，是对公共安全的主要威胁。”您呼吁削减纽约市警察局的经费，我认为这是合理的。那些认为自己将来可能竞选市长的人，通常不会将自己描述为反犹太复国主义者。过去，这些言论可能会被视为不合格的。但在您这个案例中显然没有发生。但我很好奇，当时是什么促使您表达这些观点，特别是关于警方的？

**Zohran Mamdani:** You know, I moved to New York City when I was 7 years old. This is where I grew up. And one of the things that I would think about often was the necessity of safety and justice. And growing up meant learning about the moments in which the chasm between those things felt as if it was only continuing to expand. Learning about the **中央公园五人案** (Central Park 5: 五名被错误定罪的青少年，后被无罪释放，成为司法不公的象征), growing up in the city and reading about the wrongly convicted, alleged exonerated five. Growing up and reading about Sean Bell, Eric Garner—these are victims of police brutality in the city. Reading about Michael Brown. And then in 2020, in the year that the tweet is written, the murder of George Floyd. And feeling like this chasm was at the largest I’d seen it in my own life and struggling with how far apart it felt.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我7岁时搬到纽约市。我在这里长大。我经常思考的一件事就是安全和正义的必要性。长大意味着了解那些时刻，那时安全与正义之间的鸿沟似乎只会不断扩大。在城市里长大，了解中央公园五人案，阅读那些被错误定罪、据称后来被平反的五名青少年的故事。长大后阅读肖恩·贝尔、埃里克·加纳的故事——这些都是纽约市警察暴力的受害者。阅读迈克尔·布朗的故事。然后在2020年，也就是那条推文写成的年份，乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀。我感觉这条鸿沟在我生命中达到了前所未有的宽度，并为它如此遥远而感到挣扎。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And in the time since then, becoming an assembly member representing about 130,000 people in northwest Queens, Astoria, and Long Island City, and learning that to deliver that justice doesn’t mean to do so in isolation. It means to still fulfill these twin necessities of safety and justice. And doing so means working with police officers who put their lives on the line every single day, representing Muslim New Yorkers in the district that I represent who were illegally surveilled on the basis of their faith, going so far as even to be watched when they played soccer. And the Black and brown New Yorkers who’ve been victims of police brutality. It means representing all of the 8 and a half million people of this city and understanding the necessities of doing so while delivering safety and justice and understanding that no one thing can be or should be pursued without the other.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 从那时起，我成为一名州议员，代表皇后区西北部、阿斯托利亚和长岛市约13万居民。我了解到，实现正义并非孤立行动。这意味着仍然要同时满足安全和正义这两个必要条件。而做到这一点，就意味着要与每天冒着生命危险的警官合作；代表我所代表选区内的穆斯林纽约人，他们曾因信仰被非法监视，甚至连踢足球时也被监视；以及那些遭受警察暴力的黑人和棕色人种的纽约人。这意味着要代表这座城市所有850万居民，并理解在实现安全和正义的同时，做到这些的必要性，理解任何一件事都不能或不应在没有另一件事的情况下进行。

**Michael Barbaro:** Let me fast forward a little bit to June, the primary, where you blow everyone away, all your opponents. And it seems like even on the night of that victory, you start to confront those who are skeptical of you and who you want to win over. And since we were just talking about police, let’s talk about what you have said since the primary victory. I think it was actually at The Times where my colleagues asked you about how you’re going to be thinking about the police, and I was struck that you said you were prepared to apologize to the NYPD for some of the things you had said: “defund,” the allegation that the department is racist. Given what you just said about the experiences you recollect, why issue that apology and what would the apology even be?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 让我们快进到6月的初选，您在那次选举中击败了所有对手，令所有人大吃一惊。似乎即使在那场胜利之夜，您也开始面对那些对您持怀疑态度，但您希望争取的人。既然我们刚才谈到了警察，那我们来谈谈您在初选胜利后所说的话。我想实际上是在《泰晤士报》采访中，我的同事问您将如何看待警察问题，让我印象深刻的是，您说您准备向纽约市警察局道歉，为之前说过的某些话：“削减经费”，以及指控该部门存在种族主义。鉴于您刚才回忆的那些经历，为什么要发出那样的道歉，以及道歉的内容会是什么？

**Zohran Mamdani:** The issuing of it is to reckon with the fact that it’s language that I’m applying to officers when in fact what I’m speaking about are specific practices. And when I’ve met officers, not only over the course of being an assembly person, but also running for mayor, understanding that behind every caricature, behind every headline is a New Yorker trying to do their best. And those meetings, those conversations, those are some of the ones I’ve appreciated the most where I’ve shared an apology for the language that I’ve used and a desire to continue to fulfill those same ideals of safety and of justice and to do so together.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 道歉是为了正视这样一个事实：我使用的语言是针对警官的，而实际上我谈论的是具体的做法。当我遇到警官时，不仅是在担任州议员期间，而且在竞选市长时，我明白每个漫画形象背后，每个头条新闻背后，都是一个努力做到最好的纽约人。这些会面和对话，是我最珍视的一些经历，我在其中为我曾使用的语言表示歉意，并表达了继续共同实现安全和正义这些理想的愿望。

**Michael Barbaro:** Are you apologizing for the language or for the thinking behind it? And I’m not trying to be academic about this, but do you still think that the NYPD as an institution is racist?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您是在为措辞道歉，还是为措辞背后的思想道歉？我并不是想咬文嚼字，但您是否仍然认为纽约市警察局作为一个机构是种族主义的？

**Zohran Mamdani:** No. And what I’m apologizing for is the language that I’ve used, and also doing so as someone who is clear-eyed about the necessity of still fulfilling those two things.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 不。我道歉的是我使用的措辞，同时，我也清醒地认识到仍然需要实现这两件事。

### 财政与经济政策

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Let me turn to the rest of your outreach, which has been really striking. I mean, let’s turn to developers and to, frankly, the super-rich in New York and business leaders. You’ve been openly skeptical of the role of developers. For example, you have said you don’t think billionaires should exist. Last night at your rally, you said that your movement is an existential threat to billionaires who think that they can buy an election.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 让我们谈谈您的其他外联工作，这确实引人注目。我的意思是，让我们转向开发商，坦率地说，还有纽约的超级富豪和商界领袖。您一直公开质疑开发商的角色。例如，您曾说过您认为不应该存在亿万富翁。昨晚在您的集会上，您说您的运动对那些认为自己可以买下选举的亿万富翁构成了生存威胁。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Full quote.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 原话是。

**Michael Barbaro:** You’re right. You can’t do the accurately. That’s what I wrote down. Maybe I missed the full sense. And you would like to increase taxes on those making over a million dollars a year to pay for things like the three big promises by 2%. And yet you’re meeting with many of these people at their offices, at their homes in some cases. What have you said to those leaders in your meetings with them? And what have they said to you?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您说得对。您不能准确地做到这一点。这就是我记下来的。也许我没有完全理解。您希望对年收入超过一百万美元的人增税2%，以支付三大承诺的费用。然而，您却与其中许多人在他们的办公室，有时甚至在他们家里会面。在与他们的会面中，您对这些领导人说了什么？他们又对您说了什么？

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’ve said many of the same things that I’m saying at these rallies, out on the street, in these conversations, which is that I continue to believe that two of the most straightforward and productive ways to raise revenue to fund a significant part of our affordability agenda and the need to **抵御特朗普** (Trump-proof: 指采取措施以防止或减轻特朗普政府政策可能带来的负面影响) the city are by, as you said, increasing personal income taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers—New Yorkers make a million dollars a year or more—by 2%. And by increasing the state’s top corporate tax rate from 7.25% to match that of New Jersey, 11.5%.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我在这些集会、街头和对话中说的许多话都是一样的，那就是我仍然相信，为我们的可负担性议程和城市抵御特朗普的需求筹集资金，最直接和有效的方法有二：正如您所说，将纽约市收入最高1%（年收入一百万美元或更多）的居民的个人所得税提高2%；并将州最高企业税率从7.25%提高到与新泽西州相同的11.5%。

**Michael Barbaro:** The socialist utopia of New Jersey.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 新泽西的社会主义乌托邦。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Socialist utopia of New Jersey. Yes.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 新泽西的社会主义乌托邦。是的。

**Michael Barbaro:** You were joking about that, just to be clear.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 澄清一下，您是在开玩笑。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And what I’ve appreciated about these conversations is that everyone knows exactly where I stand on these fiscal policies. And I’m looking to have a conversation both about why I believe in these fiscal policies, but also that a disagreement on those policies should not preclude us from looking for agreements elsewhere.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我很欣赏这些对话，因为每个人都清楚我在这些财政政策上的立场。我希望进行一场对话，不仅是为了解释我为何相信这些财政政策，也是为了表明，在这些政策上的分歧不应妨碍我们在其他方面寻求共识。

**Michael Barbaro:** I mean, it feels like what you’re saying to these business leaders is, look, I’m going to be making changes to the system, but I’m not turning New York City, this center of American capitalism, into a socialist utopia. If I’m kind of hearing you correctly.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我的意思是，您对这些商界领袖说的话听起来像是：“听着，我将改变这个体系，但我不会把纽约市，这个美国资本主义的中心，变成一个社会主义乌托邦。”如果我理解得没错的话。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’m and I’m…

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我是，我……

**Michael Barbaro:** Let me just get specific about a particular policy, and I want to understand your fidelity to it. The idea of what is being called a millionaire’s tax, a 2% tax on income over a million dollars, which feels very central to your agenda, felt very integral to the campaign in the primary. Since the primary, my sense, please correct me if I’m wrong, is that you’ve expressed an openness—and I don’t know if this flowed from your conversations with business leaders—to fund your agenda outside of that kind of tax. And you know this, and our listeners may not as well, New York and New York City are funky. The governor and the state legislature control all taxes, but property tax. And the two taxes you just mentioned therefore require the participation of the governor who says she does not want to participate in these so far and the state legislature. So you seem to now be saying it doesn’t necessarily matter where the money comes from. But for democratic socialists and for this agenda that you are an avatar of, isn’t taxing the rich more as a principle important? Isn’t the method here important or are you being more pragmatic about it?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 让我具体谈谈一项特定政策，我想了解您对它的忠诚度。所谓的“富人税”，即对超过一百万美元的收入征收2%的税，这在您的议程中显得非常核心，在初选竞选中也显得非常重要。自初选以来，我的感觉是，如果您认为我错了请纠正我，您已经表达了一种开放态度——我不知道这是否源于您与商界领袖的对话——即在那种税收之外为您的议程筹集资金。您知道这一点，我们的听众可能也知道，纽约州和纽约市有些特殊。除了房产税，州长和州议会控制着所有税收。因此，您刚才提到的两种税收需要州长的参与，而州长迄今为止表示她不愿参与，也需要州议会的参与。所以您现在似乎在说，钱从哪里来并不一定重要。但对于民主社会主义者和您所代表的这个议程来说，对富人多征税作为一项原则难道不重要吗？这里的方法不重要吗？还是您对此更加务实？

**Zohran Mamdani:** If you look at the chronology of the campaign, the first thing we speak about is what we are looking to fund. October 23rd, when we launched the campaign, we talk about freezing the rent for rent-stabilized tenants, making buses fast and free, delivering universal childcare. The most important thing is always the policies themselves. And I continue to believe as a principle that it’s important to have a fair system of taxation. And I do not think the one that we have is an example of that. And to me, it is always and has always been the case that far more important than the means by which you fund something is the fact that you are in fact funding it. And so I still think that these two tax proposals are the most straightforward and productive ways to do so. There are other revenue proposals that also exist that have been put forward. There’s also the fact that I have sat in Albany year after year and watched as we’ve been told the receipts we estimated, they’re actually going to be bigger this year than we thought. And if there is a proposal that the $4 billion we would raise from one of these taxes from the personal income tax increase can be found elsewhere, I’m not going to fight to bring it back to the original means that I suggested. I’m going to fight to ensure that that $4 billion is then used to fund a significant portion of universal childcare. And I think that always has to be what drives us, that we are funding the affordability agenda, not the question of how. And I do believe these are the two most straightforward ways to do so.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 如果您看看竞选活动的时间线，我们首先谈论的是我们希望资助什么。10月23日，当我们启动竞选活动时，我们谈到了为租金稳定化的租户冻结租金，让公交车快速免费，提供全民托儿服务。最重要的是政策本身。我原则上仍然认为，拥有一个公平的税收体系很重要。我认为我们目前的体系并非典范。对我来说，一直以来，资助某事的手段远不如实际资助它这个事实重要。因此，我仍然认为这两项税收提案是实现目标最直接和有效的方式。也存在其他已提出的收入提案。此外，我还年复一年地坐在奥尔巴尼，看着我们被告知预估的收入，实际上今年会比我们想象的更多。如果有一项提案，能从其他地方找到我们通过个人所得税增加而筹集的40亿美元，我不会争论要把它带回我最初建议的原始方式。我将努力确保这40亿美元被用于资助全民托儿服务的重要部分。我认为这必须始终是我们前进的动力，即我们正在资助可负担性议程，而不是如何资助的问题。我确实认为这是实现目标的两个最直接方式。

**Michael Barbaro:** Right. So the method does matter, but it doesn’t have to be this method that gets there. I mean, it does strike me that you’re already starting to confront some of the challenges that when you talk about Cuomo, you found distasteful, which is, you know, you’re dealing with a Democratic governor who isn’t on the same page with you. And that’s an immediate kind of like old versus DSA Mamdani.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 没错。所以方法确实重要，但不必非得是这种方法才能实现。我的意思是，我确实觉得您已经开始面对一些挑战，当您谈论科莫时，您觉得那些挑战令人厌恶，那就是，您正在与一位与您意见不合的民主党州长打交道。这立刻就形成了一种老派民主党与美国民主社会主义者组织马姆达尼之间的对抗。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I would contrast Governor Hochul with Governor Cuomo in that Cuomo almost made it his mission to go to war with New York City. He would cut so much of what he could find in what the state was funding across these five boroughs. And when Bill de Blasio ran on a promise of universal pre-K and the necessity of working with Albany to find the funding for that program, Governor Cuomo was one of the chief obstacles to it.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我会将霍楚尔州长与科莫州长进行对比，因为科莫几乎把与纽约市开战作为他的使命。他会削减州政府在纽约市五个行政区资助的许多项目。当比尔·白思豪以普及学前教育的承诺以及与奥尔巴尼合作寻找该项目资金的必要性竞选时，科莫州长是主要障碍之一。

**Michael Barbaro:** Right.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 没错。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And what I found is that though Governor Hochul and I have a disagreement as to the necessity of taxing the wealthiest New Yorkers, the most profitable corporations, we have a clear agreement on the importance of universal childcare. And to me that is the kind of agreement that was missing under the previous leader of the state because so often he was the obstacle to any affirmative vision of what government could be doing for working people.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我发现，尽管霍楚尔州长和我在向最富有的纽约人、最赚钱的公司征税的必要性上存在分歧，但我们在普及托儿服务的重要性上有着明确的共识。对我来说，这种共识正是前任州领导人执政期间所缺乏的，因为他常常是政府为工薪阶层服务的任何积极愿景的障碍。

### 以色列-巴勒斯坦问题上的立场

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Then there’s the Jewish community as we kind of tick through the folks that you have been meeting with, and you end up in rooms where people have been challenging you directly, sometimes emotionally, is my sense. I’m thinking about Dr. Albert Bourla, CEO of **辉瑞** (Pfizer: 一家美国跨国制药和生物技术公司)。我们的同事报道了您与他的谈话。他是大屠杀幸存者的儿子，他恳求您停止将加沙迄今为止发生的事情（现在已经停火）称为“**种族灭绝** (genocide: 蓄意和系统地消灭一个民族、种族、宗教或族裔群体的行为)”，而这正是您所用的词。他还推动您谴责“**全球圣战** (globalizing intifada: 将巴勒斯坦起义扩大到全球范围的呼吁，常被视为煽动对犹太人暴力)”这个说法，因为在他看来，这会引发针对犹太人的暴力幽灵。我的感觉是，在这些对话中，您在“全球圣战”这类事情上做出了一些让步，但在“种族灭绝”上没有。我很好奇您对像布尔拉博士这样的人以及纽约的犹太人普遍持有的观点有了怎样的理解，他们就像警察一样，可能正在努力理解您对他们所说的话，也在努力理解您谈论以色列的方式。

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 接着是犹太社区，当我们逐一列举您会见过的那些人时，您会发现自己身处一些场合，人们在那里直接挑战您，有时甚至带着情绪，这是我的感觉。我想到的是辉瑞公司的首席执行官艾伯乐博士。我们的同事报道了您与他的谈话。他是大屠杀幸存者的儿子，他恳求您停止将加沙迄今为止发生的事情（现在已经停火）称为“种族灭绝”，而这正是您所用的词。他还推动您谴责“全球圣战”这个说法，因为在他看来，这会引发针对犹太人的暴力幽灵。我的感觉是，在这些对话中，您在“全球圣战”这类事情上做出了一些让步，但在“种族灭绝”上没有。我很好奇您对像布尔拉博士这样的人以及纽约的犹太人普遍持有的观点有了怎样的理解，他们就像警察一样，可能正在努力理解您对他们所说的话，也在努力理解您谈论以色列的方式。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I would distinguish one piece in that my use of the term genocide is not a personal opinion; rather, it’s a reflection of findings by institutions, even of genocide scholars themselves, institutions like the United Nations. And it is a word that reflects what has been happening in Gaza. And these conversations that I’ve been having, both since the primary, but also frankly prior to the primary, have been illuminating for me in both having an opportunity to meet many New Yorkers, especially Jewish New Yorkers, for whom their only impression of me was through a caricature, whether it be a caricature…

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我想区分一点，我使用“种族灭绝”这个词并非个人意见；相反，它反映了包括联合国在内的机构，甚至是研究种族灭绝的学者们自己的发现。它是一个反映加沙正在发生的事情的词。而我所进行的这些对话，无论是初选之后，还是坦率地说，初选之前，都对我很有启发。它让我有机会见到许多纽约人，特别是犹太裔纽约人，他们对我的唯一印象是通过漫画形象形成的，无论是哪种漫画形象……

**Michael Barbaro:** What was that caricature, do you think?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您认为那是什么样的漫画形象？

**Zohran Mamdani:** Well, you know, I had the distinct pleasure of having around $30 million spent against me in the primary, and it was $30 million that was spent in mailers, in TV ads. There was a mailer sent by Andrew Cuomo **超级政治行动委员会** (Super PAC: 一种美国政治组织，可以无限制地筹集和支出资金，但不能直接与候选人竞选活动协调) that artificially lengthened my beard. And there was another mailer sent by another candidate that specifically chose to feature a photo of me in a kurta. And there was another mailer sent by another candidate that implied I was going to kill Jewish New Yorkers.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 嗯，你知道，我荣幸地在初选中被投入了大约3000万美元来反对我，这3000万美元花在了邮件广告和电视广告上。安德鲁·科莫的超级政治行动委员会寄出了一封邮件，人为地拉长了我的胡子。还有另一位候选人寄出的邮件，特意选择了一张我穿着库尔塔（kurta）的照片。还有另一位候选人寄出的邮件，暗示我要杀害纽约的犹太人。

**Michael Barbaro:** Part of the earlier conversation we were having about the Democratic Party. These are mailers that were sent in a Democratic primary. And so if you’re a Jewish New Yorker and you’re receiving these kinds of mailers, you’re opening an article that you’re reading and you’re reading this kind of a caricature of me. I do not begrudge skepticism. I do not begrudge concern. And what I’ve appreciated about these conversations is an opportunity to share who I am and the opinions and thoughts and commitments that may be in disagreement with those on the other end of the table, but at the very least can show that these are thoughts that are built on a belief in a universal system of human rights. It’s the opportunity to make clear that, you know, I’ve had a number of Jewish New Yorkers ask me, “You’ve said you recognize Israel’s right to exist, but you won’t recognize its right to exist as a Jewish state. Would that be the case for Saudi Arabia?” And I’ve said, absolutely, it would be, because my belief…

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 这是我们之前关于民主党讨论的一部分。这些是民主党初选期间发出的邮件。所以，如果你是纽约的犹太人，收到这类邮件，打开一篇文章阅读，读到这种对我的漫画形象。我不会对怀疑心怀不满，也不会对担忧心怀不满。而我欣赏这些对话的原因是，它们提供了一个机会，让我分享我是谁，以及我的观点、想法和承诺，这些可能与桌子另一端的人存在分歧，但至少可以表明，这些想法是建立在对普遍人权体系的信念之上的。这是一个澄清的机会，你知道，我有很多犹太裔纽约人问我：“你说你承认以色列的生存权，但你不承认它作为犹太国家的生存权。沙特阿拉伯也会是这样吗？”我说，绝对是这样，因为我的信念……

**Michael Barbaro:** So your objections remain equal. Yes. For any Saudi Arabia, UAE, as they do to Israel. For any state, I’m not going to recognize its right to be a state with a hierarchy of citizenship on the basis, whether it be of religion or race. And part of that is because especially as an American, thinking of the importance of a state which enshrines equal rights within it, and to make clear that my critiques of Israel are critiques that I would hold for any other state violating any one of these other international laws. And the focus that I and many other New Yorkers have had on the question specifically of Israel’s violations of these international human rights is also in part because of our unique complicity as Americans in those violations. You mean because of the American funding of the war in Gaza and prior to that, and the nature of sending, you know, $4 billion a year, every year prior to this.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 所以您的反对意见依然平等。是的。对于沙特阿拉伯、阿联酋，就像对以色列一样。对于任何国家，我不会承认它有权成为一个基于宗教或种族而存在公民等级制度的国家。部分原因在于，尤其作为一名美国人，我考虑到一个国家在其内部保障平等权利的重要性，并明确指出，我对以色列的批评，同样适用于任何其他违反这些国际法的国家。而我以及许多其他纽约人之所以特别关注以色列违反这些国际人权的问题，部分原因也在于我们美国人在这些侵犯行为中独特的共谋关系。您的意思是，因为美国资助了加沙战争，在此之前，每年还提供40亿美元的资金，每年都是如此。

**Michael Barbaro:** One of your critiques of the Democratic Party, it feels worth mentioning this here, is **进步派，巴勒斯坦除外** (Progressive Except for Palestine - PEP: 指一些自称进步派但不支持巴勒斯坦权利或对以色列政策持批判态度的个人或群体)。我认为，鉴于您刚才的回答，我理解了其中的论点，即在您看来，民主党民选官员将巴勒斯坦人排除在全球普遍正义的范畴之外。

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您对民主党的一个批评，我认为在这里值得一提，就是“进步派，巴勒斯坦除外”。我想，鉴于您刚才的回答，我理解了其中的论点，即在您看来，民主党民选官员将巴勒斯坦人排除在全球普遍正义的范畴之外。

**Michael Barbaro:** You well understand that previous mayors to you have not put the same emphasis on Palestinian rights and have, I’m thinking in the case of Mike Bloomberg, personally donated tremendous amounts of money to social services in Israel, or in the case of Mayor Adams, visited Israel. Mayor Adams ran in 2021 with a promise that he would retire in the Golden Heights occupied. He not only visited Israel, he met with settlement leaders and came back promising to increase cooperation with them.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您很清楚，在您之前的市长们并没有对巴勒斯坦权利给予同样的重视。我想到的是迈克·布隆伯格，他个人向以色列的社会服务机构捐赠了巨额资金；或者市长亚当斯，他访问了以色列。亚当斯市长在2021年竞选时承诺，他将在被占领的戈兰高地退休。他不仅访问了以色列，还与定居点领导人会面，回来后承诺加强与他们的合作。

**Michael Barbaro:** Well, we’re at this really interesting moment. There’s now a ceasefire, potentially a peace process. And because of that history of the way New York City mayors have treated Israel, because I take the critique of journalists when people say he’s running for mayor, not for leader of the free world, not for envoy to the Middle East. But I am curious, since you raised it and since Jewish New Yorkers ask you, including at Temple Beth Ethohim, I think on Sunday, which version of Israel you can support because of your profound critique of Israel. I am curious if you can be a little specific because we are now in that moment where potentially a new Middle East may be born. Is there a version of Israel that you could be comfortable with and maybe even, as almost all mayors have in the past, visit?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 嗯，我们正处于一个非常有趣的时刻。现在已经停火，可能正在进行和平进程。鉴于纽约市市长们过去对待以色列的方式，以及我接受记者们的批评——人们说他竞选的是市长，而不是自由世界的领袖，也不是中东特使。但我很好奇，既然您提到了，而且犹太裔纽约人也问您，包括周日在Temple Beth Ethohim，鉴于您对以色列的深刻批判，您能支持哪种版本的以色列。我好奇您能否具体说明一下，因为我们正处于一个可能诞生新中东的时刻。有没有一个您能接受的以色列版本，甚至像过去几乎所有市长那样，去访问它？

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’ve said and I continue to believe that one need not visit Israel to stand up for Jewish New Yorkers. And I’ve also said, in the question of visiting countries outside of ours, that my focus is going to be on New York City. And my belief, whether it be for Israel and Palestine or anywhere across the world, is the importance of equal rights as part of any future that we’re fighting for. And as you said, I am running to be the mayor of the city. And I also know, to your point, that there are millions of New Yorkers, myself included, who care deeply about Israel and Palestine. And my desire is to be a mayor who is both clear in my belief in universal human rights, the necessity of extending those beliefs of freedom and safety and justice and equality to all people, and that that must also include Palestinians, and that my job in leading the city is to embody that shared sense of humanity.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我说过，并且我仍然相信，一个人不必访问以色列就能为纽约的犹太人仗义执言。我也说过，在访问我们国家以外的国家的问题上，我的重点将放在纽约市。而我的信念，无论是对以色列和巴勒斯坦，还是世界任何地方，都是平等权利作为我们为之奋斗的任何未来的一部分的重要性。正如您所说，我正在竞选纽约市市长。我也知道，就您而言，有数百万纽约人，包括我自己，深切关心以色列和巴勒斯坦。我希望成为一名市长，既要明确我坚信普世人权，坚信必须将这些自由、安全、正义和平等的信念扩展到所有人民，这其中也必须包括巴勒斯坦人，而且我领导这座城市的工作就是体现这种共同的人道精神。

**Michael Barbaro:** I’m hearing you say an injustice anywhere is essentially an injustice to everywhere, to everything.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我听起来您的意思是，任何地方的不公本质上都是对所有地方、对一切事物的不公。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yes, I would say that that’s correct. And I think what’s been troubling to many in this city has been the ability to be blind to certain injustices. We have a mayor right now who has often been blind to the suffering of many in this city, especially I would say Palestinian New Yorkers. I met a Palestinian New Yorker from Bay Ridge about two weeks ago. It’s an older man, walked with a cane. We were having chai in Astoria, and he told me how he’d lived in this city for decades. He’s from Gaza, and for decades he worked to save up to build a house in Gaza. And he built that house, and it was the pride and joy of his life. And the Israeli military destroyed that house in one minute. And in the rubble of that house lay the dreams that he had held for decades. And how his son and his grandkids were in Gaza, continue to be in Gaza today. And he told me about how his son called him the other week and said, “Listen, listen to my son.” He gave the phone over to this man’s grandchild, and the grandchild said, “I’m hungry. Can you send me anything?” And this man had to grapple with the fact that there was nothing more he could send. There was no way he could reach out. This is a New Yorker.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的，我认为这是正确的。而且我认为，这座城市中许多人感到困扰的是，他们对某些不公视而不见的能力。我们现在有一位市长，他常常对这座城市中许多人的苦难视而不见，尤其是巴勒斯坦裔纽约人。大约两周前，我在贝里奇遇到一位巴勒斯坦裔纽约人。他是一位拄着拐杖的老人。我们在阿斯托利亚喝茶，他告诉我他在这座城市生活了几十年。他来自加沙，几十年来努力攒钱在加沙盖了一栋房子。他盖了那栋房子，那是他一生的骄傲和喜悦。但以色列军队在一分钟内摧毁了那栋房子。在那栋房子的瓦砾中，埋藏着他几十年来怀抱的梦想。他的儿子和孙子们当时在加沙，今天也仍然在加沙。他告诉我，他的儿子上周给他打电话说：“听着，听我儿子说。”他把电话递给了这位老人的孙子，孙子说：“我饿了。你能给我寄点什么吗？”而这位老人不得不面对一个事实，那就是他再也无法寄送任何东西了。他无法伸出援手。这是一个纽约人。

**Michael Barbaro:** I’m just noting the emotion in your voice here because I think there’s no other way to respond to this kind of despair and to hold this despair and say that as the mayor of your city, I see what you are struggling through, and the very least you deserve as someone who looks at you with the full humanity you deserve. And that’s what I want to bring, as a real belief in a shared sense of humanity for all, because for far too long there have been exceptions that have been carved out.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我只是注意到您声音中的情感，因为我认为除了这样回应这种绝望，并承受这种绝望，然后说，作为你们城市的市长，我看到了你们正在经历的挣扎，你们至少应该得到我以完全的人性看待你们的尊重，别无他法。而这正是我想要带来的，一种对所有人共享人性的真正信念，因为长期以来，一直存在着被刻意划分出的例外。

### 应对特朗普的挑战

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Even if you’re able to convince all these constituencies that you are the right candidate to be mayor in this general election—a safe candidate, more than safe, desirable—the argument can be made that there is, because of President Trump, something profoundly unsafe in theory about your election, entirely out of your control, which is that if you’re elected, and Trump said this, he’ll target New York, he’ll target you. The pretense might be crime. It might be illegal immigration. I think you’ve used this word. It’s an inevitability if you become elected. Can you understand why that might be a complicating factor in people’s decision to vote for you? As unfair as it would be to you, what I’ve described as inevitability is Donald Trump’s desire to send the **国民警卫队** (National Guard: 美国武装力量的一部分，由各州管理，可在国内紧急情况和联邦任务中服役) to New York City. And what I would say to those who would say this argument, whomever they may be, wherever they may be, whatever former governor, whoever, you know, Andrew Cuomo living in Westchester may be, is that Donald Trump is not waiting for me to be the mayor to enact this kind of political retribution. He had arguably the most collaborative mayor he could find in Eric Adams. And even with that mayor, he pulled $80 million out of a city bank account. He suspended $50 million in funding because the city refused to give up, but kept the National Guard at bay. Yes. While looking to suspend $18 billion in federal infrastructure funding in no small part because of Democrats at the national level refusing to allow him to throw 4 million Americans off of their healthcare. My point being that retribution is not something that will only appear in this city by virtue of my being mayor. It’s already a feature of what it looks like to live on in Donald Trump’s America.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 即使您能够说服所有这些选民，您是这次大选中担任市长的合适人选——一个安全的候选人，甚至不止是安全，而是令人向往的——但有一种说法是，由于特朗普总统的存在，您的当选在理论上存在某种深远的不安全性，这完全超出了您的控制范围。那就是，如果您当选，特朗普曾说过，他会针对纽约，针对您。借口可能是犯罪，也可能是非法移民。我想您用过这个词。如果您当选，这是一种必然。您能理解为什么这可能会成为人们投票给您的一个复杂因素吗？尽管这对您不公平，但我所说的“必然性”是指唐纳德·特朗普希望将国民警卫队派往纽约市。而对于那些持这种论点的人，无论他们是谁，无论他们身在何处，无论他们是前州长，还是住在威彻斯特的安德鲁·科莫，我想说的是，唐纳德·特朗普不会等到我成为市长才实施这种政治报复。他可以说找到了埃里克·亚当斯这样最合作的市长。但即使有这样的市长，他还是从市银行账户中抽走了8000万美元。他暂停了5000万美元的资金，因为市政府拒绝放弃，但仍将国民警卫队拒之门外。是的。同时，他还试图暂停180亿美元的联邦基础设施资金，这很大程度上是因为国家层面的民主党人拒绝让他将400万美国人从他们的医疗保健中剔除。我的意思是，报复并非仅仅因为我成为市长才出现在这座城市。它已经是生活在唐纳德·特朗普治下的美国的一个特征。

**Zohran Mamdani:** And what we’ve seen, whether it be in his first administration or now in his second administration, is that Donald Trump, if you want to stand up to him, the first thing you have to do is be able to actually be willing to fight him. And what we have in this moment is not just my campaign, but Andrew Cuomo’s, which is one that is so unable to stand up to him in large part because of the fact that he knows his narrow path to city hall is paved by the very donors who gave us Donald Trump’s second term, which is why there’s overlap. When he was asked would he condemn Donald Trump for the weaponization of justice in the prosecution of Attorney General Tish James, he said, “Condemn him for what?” He released a statement on the weaponization that refused to name either Donald Trump or Tish James. And so my point being, there already exists retribution here in this city, the likes of which that has immense consequences. We have a candidate who is running on the promise of being able to stand up to Trump while he can’t even name him. And what I will do is no doubt face these kinds of threats, including those that have been made about deporting me, arresting me, denaturalizing me.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我们看到，无论是他的第一任政府还是现在的第二任政府，唐纳德·特朗普，如果你想对抗他，首先你必须真正愿意与他抗争。而我们此刻拥有的不仅仅是我的竞选，还有安德鲁·科莫的竞选，后者之所以无法对抗他，很大程度上是因为他知道自己通往市政厅的狭窄道路是由那些为唐纳德·特朗普带来第二任期的捐助者铺就的，这就是为什么两者之间存在重叠。当他被问及是否会谴责唐纳德·特朗普在起诉司法部长蒂什·詹姆斯时将司法武器化，他说：“谴责他什么？”他发布了一份关于武器化的声明，却拒绝提及唐纳德·特朗普或蒂什·詹姆斯。所以我的意思是，这座城市已经存在报复，其后果极其严重。我们有一位候选人，他承诺能够对抗特朗普，却连他的名字都无法说出口。而我将毫无疑问地面对这些威胁，包括那些关于驱逐我、逮捕我、取消我公民身份的威胁。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I will face them knowing that just by virtue of Donald Trump saying something, it doesn’t make it law. What actually makes it law is when we go through the court system. And what we’ve seen is an approach in California where the attorney general, the mayor of LA, the governor of the state came together to file a lawsuit where a federal judge recently found in their favor: the deployment of the National Guard was illegal. And also an attorney general who found that for every dollar that they spent on legal fees, they were able to recover more than $30,000 in federal funds that would have otherwise been stripped of them.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我将直面这些挑战，因为我知道唐纳德·特朗普仅仅说些什么并不能使其成为法律。真正使其成为法律的是我们通过法院系统时。我们看到加州采取了一种做法，州检察长、洛杉矶市长和州长共同提起诉讼，联邦法官最近裁定他们胜诉：国民警卫队的部署是非法的。此外，一位检察长还发现，他们每花费一美元的法律费用，就能收回超过三万美元的联邦资金，否则这些资金就会被剥夺。

**Michael Barbaro:** Ultimately, a major reason why Trump might intervene in New York would be part of an **美国移民及海关执法局** (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement - ICE: 美国国土安全部下属的执法机构，负责移民法执行和边境安全) campaign to round up and deport undocumented immigrants. That’s been an argument pretense he’s made in several places where the National Guard eventually comes. There are an estimated 400,000 undocumented immigrants in New York. And as you found as you ran this primary that was so successful and you met with many Trump-supporting New Yorkers who have turned around and supported you, is that their viewpoint on these issues is complicated, and many of them have serious objections to the level of undocumented immigration in a place like New York City. But I don’t hear from your campaign that you’re going to be participating in any Trump-led effort to detain, deport undocumented immigrants. Why not?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 最终，特朗普可能干预纽约的一个主要原因将是美国移民及海关执法局（ICE）旨在围捕和驱逐无证移民的行动的一部分。这是他曾在几个国民警卫队最终进驻的地方提出的借口。纽约约有40万无证移民。正如您在这次成功的初选中发现的，以及您会见的许多转而支持您的特朗普支持者，他们对这些问题的看法是复杂的，其中许多人对纽约市的无证移民数量持严重异议。但我没有从您的竞选活动中听到，您将参与任何由特朗普主导的拘留、驱逐无证移民的行动。为什么不呢？

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’m not looking to assist Donald Trump in his attempt to fulfill his campaign promise to create the single largest deportation force in American history. I’m not looking to do so because even if you know that some of your—maybe perhaps many of your supporters—do want illegal immigration to be treated differently than it has. What I’ve heard from my supporters and what I’ve heard from New Yorkers, frankly, is a desire for dignity. And in looking at what ICE’s presence has been in New York City, what it has meant for our city, seeing at the very least an absence of that, and in fact an attack not only on the question of dignity, by the very fabric of the city, right? Where there are New Yorkers I know of who took down the numbers on every apartment on their floor so that ICE wouldn’t know where anyone lived.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我不打算协助唐纳德·特朗普实现他竞选承诺中建立美国历史上最大规模驱逐部队的企图。我不打算这样做，因为即使您知道您的某些支持者——甚至可能是许多支持者——确实希望非法移民问题得到不同于以往的处理。坦率地说，我从我的支持者和纽约人那里听到的是对尊严的渴望。审视美国移民及海关执法局在纽约市的存在意味着什么，它对我们的城市意味着什么，至少是它的缺席，实际上是对尊严的攻击，也是对城市肌理的攻击，对吗？我认识一些纽约人，他们把他们楼层每间公寓的门牌号都拆掉了，这样美国移民及海关执法局就不会知道任何人的住处。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I spoke to a Dominican barbershop owner in Harlem who told me that all of his barbers have legal status, and they are terrified of coming to work. A general sense of the hollowing out of the immigrant hubs of this city. And no, I’m not going to help Donald Trump in doing so. I’m in fact going to fight Donald Trump when he looks to tear families apart. And I’m going to do so because I know what the stakes are. When he detains a 6-year-old girl from Queens and deports her, I know that her principal is writing a letter to ICE saying, “Please don’t do this.”

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我和哈莱姆区一位多米尼加理发店老板聊过，他告诉我，他所有的理发师都有合法身份，但他们都害怕来上班。这座城市的移民聚居地普遍存在空心化的感觉。不，我不会帮助唐纳德·特朗普这样做。事实上，当他试图拆散家庭时，我将对抗他。我这样做是因为我知道利害关系。当他拘留并驱逐一名来自皇后区的六岁女孩时，我知道她的校长正在写信给美国移民及海关执法局说：“请不要这样做。”

**Michael Barbaro:** I mean, here you’re saying the method can’t be separated from the goal, and you’re rejecting the method because you’re rejecting the goal. I mean, that’s very clear.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我的意思是，您在这里说方法不能与目标分离，您拒绝这种方法是因为您拒绝这个目标。我的意思是，这非常清楚。

**Zohran Mamdani:** I think also I reject the goal. It’s not just the manner in which this detention is happening. It’s the fact that the goal here is cruelty. The goal is to rip these families apart, and the goal is to attack so much of what is the foundation of this city as an immigrant city.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 我认为我也拒绝这个目标。这不仅仅是这种拘留发生的方式。事实是，这里的目标是残忍。目标是拆散这些家庭，目标是攻击作为移民城市，这座城市的许多基础。

**Michael Barbaro:** Would you ever meet with President Trump in the hope that you could defang this person, this president who may have ill will toward you, but frankly doesn’t really know you at all?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 您是否会与特朗普总统会面，希望能够削弱这位可能对您怀有恶意，但坦率地说，根本不了解您的总统？

**Zohran Mamdani:** Absolutely. I will meet with President Trump. I think it’s incumbent upon any mayor of this city to meet with the president of the country. What I won’t do is work with President Trump at the expense of the city. That’s the critique that I’ve made of Andrew Cuomo and of Eric Adams, is that their conversations with Trump have more to do with themselves than to do with the people of the city. It’s not that they’re talking, it’s that who are they talking to him about.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 当然。我会和特朗普总统会面。我认为任何这座城市的市长都有责任与国家总统会面。我不会做的是以牺牲城市利益为代价与特朗普总统合作。这是我对安德鲁·科莫和埃里克·亚当斯的批评，即他们与特朗普的对话更多是关于他们自己，而不是关于这座城市的人民。问题不在于他们是否对话，而在于他们与他谈论的是谁。

### 建立运动与兑现承诺

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** I want to end this conversation on the movement that you’ve quite clearly created in New York City. It’s a movement we saw on vivid display last night that argues that the democratic politics of the modern era, the old formulas, that word resonated last night when you said it, have failed and that you can replace it with something new. And in your speech at this rally we all went to, you likened it to the great movements of American history: the civil rights movement, the movement for labor rights that created the modern weekend where workers can take a break, the **罗斯福新政** (New Deal: 20世纪30年代美国总统罗斯福为应对大萧条而推出的一系列经济和社会改革计划) and the birth of the social safety net.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 我想用您在纽约市明确创建的这场运动来结束这次对话。我们昨晚清晰地看到了这场运动，它主张现代民主政治的旧模式（您昨晚说这个词时引起了共鸣）已经失败，而您可以将其替换为新的东西。在我们在座各位都参加的集会演讲中，您将其比作美国历史上的伟大运动：民权运动，创建了现代周末让工人得以休息的劳工权利运动，罗斯福新政以及社会安全网的诞生。

**Michael Barbaro:** That sets expectations pretty high. I’m not sure you can get much higher, and there’s nobility in that, and there’s real risk in that. And so do you worry that it will be hard to deliver on those expectations? You’re pretty new to management on this scale. And if it’s impossible or even really difficult to deliver, what does it do to this movement?

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 这将期望值定得很高。我不确定还能更高，这其中有高尚之处，也有真正的风险。那么，您是否担心难以实现这些期望？您在如此大规模的管理方面还是个新手。如果无法实现，甚至非常难以实现，那对这场运动会造成什么影响？

**Zohran Mamdani:** I’m glad I won’t have to answer the hypothetical because I fully intend to deliver, and we have to. We came to these policies, to these commitments not because of a poll that we commissioned or a consultant that we sat with. In fact, the polls said that you should focus on public safety. Not also had me tied with someone else. Literally, anybody else, and I beat that guy. But I say this to say that it’s New Yorkers who told us it was housing. It’s New Yorkers who told us it was childcare. It’s New Yorkers who told us it was the slowest buses in America. And the necessity of fulfilling these commitments are also to ensure that those New Yorkers stay New Yorkers. They continue to see themselves in this city. And the only way we can do so is if they see their struggles in our politics. And there are many politicians who will tell you that the best life could ever be is the one that you’re living in right now. And those are also the ones who have paved the way for the politics we’ve seen of Donald Trump because you have to be able to reckon with the material needs of working people and the fact that so many of them are going unmet.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 很高兴我不需要回答这个假设性问题，因为我完全打算兑现承诺，而且我们必须这样做。我们提出这些政策和承诺，并非因为我们委托的民意调查或我们咨询过的顾问。事实上，民意调查曾说我应该关注公共安全。民调也曾显示我与其他人不相上下。确实，是任何其他人，而我击败了他们。但我说这些是为了表明，是纽约人告诉我们住房问题很重要。是纽约人告诉我们托儿服务很重要。是纽约人告诉我们，美国的公交车速度最慢。而履行这些承诺的必要性，也是为了确保这些纽约人继续留在纽约。他们继续在这座城市中看到自己的身影。而我们能做到这一点的唯一方式，就是让他们在我们的政治中看到他们的挣扎。有许多政客会告诉你，最好的生活就是你现在过的生活。而这些人也正是为我们所见的唐纳德·特朗普政治铺平道路的人，因为你必须能够正视劳动人民的物质需求，以及他们中许多人的需求未能得到满足的事实。

**Michael Barbaro:** Right. Sounds like you’re saying, “I know what I believe. I’m not going to compromise on my values, and my administration will not compromise on my values, and that will be enough.” This is like my translator.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 没错。听起来您在说：“我知道我的信念。我不会在我的价值观上妥协，我的政府也不会在我的价值观上妥协，这就足够了。”这就像我的翻译器一样。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Perhaps it will be enough.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 也许会足够。

**Michael Barbaro:** Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, thank you very much for your time.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 州议员卓兰·马姆达尼，非常感谢您抽出时间。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Thank you very much. It’s a pleasure.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 非常感谢。很高兴。

**Michael Barbaro:** Good luck to you.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 祝您好运。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Thank you. Same to you.

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 谢谢。也祝您好运。

**Michael Barbaro:** Oh, yes. Well, we’re doing a quick interview photo.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 哦，是的。我们快速拍一张采访照片。

**Zohran Mamdani:** Yes. Should we do one of those politician handshakes or no?

**卓兰·马姆达尼:** 是的。我们要不要来个政客式的握手？还是不用？

**Michael Barbaro:** No, no, no, no. Later tonight, Zohran Mamdani will participate in the first general election debate of the mayor’s race, where he’ll face off against Andrew Cuomo, now running as an independent, and Curtis Sliwa, a Republican. The debate begins at 7:00 p.m.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 不，不，不，不。今晚晚些时候，卓兰·马姆达尼将参加市长竞选的第一场大选辩论，他将与目前作为独立候选人参选的安德鲁·科莫以及共和党人柯蒂斯·斯利瓦对决。辩论将于晚上7点开始。

### 每日新闻速览

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

**Michael Barbaro:** Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the Trump administration has secretly authorized the CIA to conduct covert action in Venezuela, a major escalation in its campaign against the country’s authoritarian leader, Nicholas Maduro. The U.S. military has already been destroying boats off Venezuela’s coast that it claims are transporting drugs. And in private conversations, U.S. officials are now making it clear that their end goal is to drive Maduro from power.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 以下是您今天还需要了解的其他新闻。《泰晤士报》报道称，特朗普政府已秘密授权中央情报局在委内瑞拉进行秘密行动，这是其针对该国威权领导人尼古拉斯·马杜罗的行动的重大升级。美国军方已经摧毁了委内瑞拉海岸附近一些据称运送毒品的船只。在私人对话中，美国官员现在明确表示，他们的最终目标是将马杜罗赶下台。

**Michael Barbaro:** And in oral arguments on Wednesday, the Supreme Court’s conservative majority appeared ready to challenge a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by prohibiting state lawmakers from using race as a factor in drawing election maps. If the court decides that race may not be used in such maps, it could allow Republican legislators to eliminate at least a dozen Democratic-held House seats across the South.

**迈克尔·巴巴罗:** 在周三的口头辩论中，最高法院的保守派多数似乎准备挑战1965年《选举权法案》的一项关键条款，即禁止州立法者在划分选举区时将种族作为考量因素。如果法院裁定在此类地图中不得使用种族因素，这可能允许共和党立法者在南方各地取消至少十几个民主党控制的众议院席位。

**Michael Barbaro:** Today’s episode was produced by OA Cherved, Mary Wilson, Jessica Chung, and Mujade. It was edited by Paige Cowat and Brendan Clinkenberg.
