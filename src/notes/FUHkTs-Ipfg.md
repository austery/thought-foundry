### 1982年SAT的“送命题”

1982年，一道**SAT**（Scholastic Assessment Test: 学术能力评估测试）数学题让所有考生都答错了。题目如下：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1982, there was one SAT question that every single student got wrong. Here it is.</p>
</details>

上图中，圆A的半径是圆B半径的1/3。从图中所示位置开始，圆A绕着圆B滚动。圆A的圆心首次回到起始点时，圆A转动了多少圈？选项是A, 3/2；B, 3；C, 6；D, 9/2；或E, 9。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the figure above, the radius of circle A is 1/3 the radius of circle B. Starting from the position shown in the figure, circle A rolls around circle B. At the end of how many revolutions of circle A will the center of the circle first reach its starting point. Is it A, 3/2, B, three, C, six, D, 9/2, or E, nine?</p>
</details>

SAT题目设计旨在快速解答，这场考试给学生30分钟解决25道题，平均每题大约一分钟。所以请随意暂停视频，尝试解答。你的答案是什么？我现在就可以告诉你，选项B，也就是三，是不正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SAT Questions are designed to be quick. This exam gave students 30 minutes to solve 25 problems, so about a minute each. So feel free to pause the video here and try to solve it. What is your answer? I'll tell you right now that option B, or three, is not correct.</p>
</details>

我第一次看到这道题时，直觉答案就是B，因为圆的周长是2πr，既然圆B的半径是圆A半径的三倍，那么圆B的周长也必然是圆A周长的三倍。所以从逻辑上讲，圆A应该绕着圆B转动三整圈。因此我的答案是三。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I first saw this problem, my intuitive answer was B, because the circumference of a circle is just two pi r, and since the radius of circle B is three times the radius of circle A, the circumference of circle B must also be three times the circumference of circle A. So logically, it should take three full rotations of circle A to roll around circle B. So my answer was three.</p>
</details>

这是错误的，但答案A、C、D和E也都是错的。第17题无人答对的原因是，出题人自己也答错了。他们也认为答案是三。所以实际的正确答案并没有作为选项列在试卷上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is wrong, but so are answers A, C, D, and E. The reason no one got question 17 correct is that the test writers themselves got it wrong. They also thought the answer was three. So the actual correct answer was not listed as an option on the test.</p>
</details>

像这样的错误本不该在SAT上发生。几十年来，它是每个美国大学生都必须参加的考试，以决定人们的整个未来而闻名。正如当时一份报纸所说：“如果你在SAT考试中搞砸了，你就可以忘了它。你作为一个有生产力的公民的生涯就结束了。放弃吧，孩子。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mistakes like this aren't supposed to happen on the SAT. For decades, it was the one exam every student had to take to go to college in the US. It had a reputation for determining people's entire futures. As a newspaper from the time stated, "If you mess up on your SAT tests, you can forget it. Your life as a productive citizen is over. Hang it up, son."</p>
</details>

### 学生们的挑战与硬币旋转悖论

在30万考生中，只有三名学生——Shivan Kartha、Bruce Taub和Doug Jungreis——就这个错误写信给了负责管理SAT的**美国大学理事会**（College Board: 负责管理SAT等标准化考试的非营利组织）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of 300,000 test takers, just three students wrote about the error to the College Board, the company that administers the SAT, Shivan Kartha, Bruce Taub, and Doug Jungreis.</p>
</details>

Shivan Kartha回忆道：“我年轻时做了很多数学竞赛题。我可能做了几千道数学题，我读了这道题，很惊讶它的措辞有多糟糕。我只是写下了三，我想他们就是想要这个答案。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- I did a lot of math problems when I was young for the competitions. I probably did thousands of math problems and I read it and I was amazed how badly it's worded. I just put three down. I figured that's what they wanted.</p>
</details>

这三名学生确信所有列出的答案都不正确，他们的信件也表明了这一点。正如考试服务中心的一位主管回忆，他们没有说他们提出了可能的替代答案，或者说我们可能错了。他们直截了当地说：“你们错了”，而且他们证明了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- The three students were confident none of the listed answers were correct, and their letters showed it. As a director at the testing service recalled, they didn't say they had come up with possible alternative answers or that maybe we were wrong. They said flat out, "You're wrong," and they proved it.</p>
</details>

Doug Jungreis说：“我和其他一些人讨论过，我说，我觉得有个错误，他们大多说，‘没人关心。’我给**美国教育考试服务中心**（Educational Testing Service, ETS: 负责开发和管理SAT等考试）写了一封信。过了一会儿他们给我们打电话，说我是对的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- I discussed it with some other people and said, I think there was a mistake, and they mostly said, "No one cares." I wrote a letter to the Educational Testing Service. It was a little while later they called us and said I was correct.</p>
</details>

这是他们的论点。这个问题的最简单版本是使用两枚相同的硬币。它们的周长完全相同。所以根据我们最初的逻辑，这枚硬币绕着另一枚硬币滚动时应该只旋转一次。所以我们来试试看。好的。但是等等，我们可以看到它在滚到一半时就已经正面朝上了。所以如果我们完成它绕着另一枚硬币的滚动，它将旋转两次，而不是一次。即使硬币大小完全相同，这里也没有任何花招，你可以自己试试看，我会再慢慢做一遍。这是一次，两次。这就是所谓的**硬币旋转悖论**（Coin Rotation Paradox: 一种几何悖论，指当一个圆围绕另一个相同大小的圆滚动时，外圆的旋转次数会比预期多一次）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Here is their argument. The simplest version of this problem is with two identical coins. These have the exact same circumference. So by our initial logic, this coin should rotate exactly once as it rolls around the other. So let's try it. Okay. But wait, we can see it's already right side up at the halfway point. So if we finish rolling it around the other coin, it'll have rotated not once, but twice. Even though the coins are the exact same size There are no tricks here, you can try it for yourself, and I'll do it again slowly. That's one, two. This is known as the coin rotation paradox.</p>
</details>

这个悖论也适用于第17题。我制作了一个按比例缩小的模型。标准化考试的一个有用技巧是，尽管他们说图片不按比例，但它们几乎总是按比例的。所以当我们让圆A绕着圆B滚动时，我们可以看到它总共旋转了一次、两次、三次和四次。所以这道题的正确答案实际上是四。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This paradox also applies to question 17. I've made a to scale model of the problem. One useful tip for standardized tests, even though they say their images are not to scale, they almost always are. So when we roll circle A around circle B, we can see that it rotates once, twice, three times, and four times in total. So the correct answer to this question is actually four.</p>
</details>

再次强调，圆比我们预期的多旋转了一次。为了理解这一点，我们用一些彩带包裹这个大圆，并使其长度与周长相同，然后我将其固定在桌子上，形成一条直线。我在这里加了一些纸，以便它可以在上面滚动。现在它滚动了一次、两次、三次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once again, the circle rotates one more time than we expected. To understand this, let's wrap this larger circle in some ribbon And I'll make it the same length as the circumference, and then I will stick it down to the table as a straight line. I'm adding some paper here so there's something for this to roll on. And now it rolls one, two, three times.</p>
</details>

当我们把这条直线路径变成圆形路径时，发生的情况是圆A现在滚动了周长长度，并且它正在绕着一个圆移动。圆形路径本身的形状使得圆A额外旋转了一次，以回到其起始点。所以这是这个问题的通用解法。找到圆B和圆A周长之间的比率，然后加上一次旋转，以解释所走的圆形路径。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's happening when we turn this straight path into a circular one is that circle A is now rolling the length of the circumference and it's going around a circle. The shape of the circular path itself makes circle A do an additional rotation to return to its starting point. So this is the general solution to the problem. Find the ratio between the circumferences of circle B and circle A and then add one rotation to account for the circular path traveled.</p>
</details>

### 多种视角与天文学应用

但有一种方法可以正确地得到三。让我们从圆B向外看圆A的角度来计算圆A的旋转次数。我们可以看到圆A旋转了一次、两次、三次。而且无论你从哪个圆看，对圆A来说，它也旋转了三次才能回到绕着圆B的起始位置。同样，从硬币的角度来看，我们可以看到外层硬币在绕着内层硬币滚动时只旋转了一次。使用圆的角度就像把圆的周长变成一条直线。只有作为外部观察者，我们才能真正看到外圆沿着圆形路径回到其起始点，从而给我们带来额外的一次旋转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there is a way to correctly get three. Let's count the rotations of circle A from the perspective of circle B looking out at A. We can see circle A rotates one, two, three times. And it doesn't matter which circle you are looking from, to circle A, it also rotates three times to come back to its starting position around circle B. Similarly, from the perspective of the coins, we can see that the outer coin only rotates once as it rolls around the inner coin. Using the perspective of a circle is just like turning the circle's circumference into a straight line. It's only as external observers that we actually see the outer circle travel a circular path back to its starting point, giving us the one extra rotation.</p>
</details>

但甚至还有另一个答案。如果你仔细看第17题，它问圆A绕着圆B回到起始点时，圆A转动了多少“revolutions”。在天文学中，“revolution”的定义是精确的。它是一个物体围绕另一个物体完成的完整轨道。地球绕着太阳“revolves”，这与它绕着自己的轴“rotates”是不同的。所以根据天文学对“revolution”的定义，圆A只绕着圆B“revolves”一次。它绕了一圈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there's even another answer. If you look closely at question 17, it asks how many revolutions circle A makes as it rolls around circle B back to its starting point. Now, in astronomy, the definition of a revolution is precise. It's a complete orbit around another body. The earth revolves around the sun, which is different from it rotating about its axis. So by the astronomical definition of a revolution, circle A only revolves around circle B once. It goes around one time.</p>
</details>

现在，其他关于“revolution”的定义确实包括物体绕自身轴旋转的运动。所以“一”并不是一个明确的答案，但如果能证明至少三种不同的解决方案，这道题的措辞就极其模糊了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, other definitions of a revolution do include the motion of an object rotating about its own axis. So one isn't a definitive answer, but the wording of this question is extremely ambiguous if you can justify at least three different solutions.</p>
</details>

在审查了学生们的信件后，**美国大学理事会**几周后公开承认了他们的错误，并取消了所有考生的这道题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After reviewing the letters from the students, the College Board publicly admitted their mistake a few weeks later and nullified the question for all test takers.</p>
</details>

Doug Jungreis回忆道：“他们说他们要作废这道题，他们要告诉新闻媒体，他们认为我们应该被告知新闻可能会联系我们。我做了很多电话采访，NBC新闻也来到了我的学校。他们说我是对的，他们作废了这道题。所以那很棒。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- They said they were discounting the problem and they were calling us because they were gonna tell the news and they thought that we should be warned that the news might contact us. I did a bunch of phone interviews and NBC News, they came to my school. They said I was right and they were discounting it. So that was great.</p>
</details>

但解释远不止于此。一位数学家说：“很容易得到一个直观的理由，但要正式证明答案是四真的很难。如果你想，我可以给你一些证明。”主持人说：“嗯，那太棒了。我想那肯定会，我们肯定会很感激。”数学家说：“我有一块白板，因为我是一名数学家，所以我碰巧这里有一块白板。等等。你能看到吗？”主持人回答：“是的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- But there's more to the explanation. - It's easy to get an intuitive reason, but it's really hard to formally prove that the answer is four. I could give you some proofs if you want. - Well, that would be wonderful. I think that would be, we'd appreciate that for sure. - I have a whiteboard because I'm a mathematician, so I just happen to have a whiteboard here. Hold on. Can you see that? - Yep.</p>
</details>

事实证明，小圆的旋转量总是与圆心移动的距离相同。那么，为什么会这样呢？假设你有一台摄像机，并且摄像机总是指向圆心。那么在你的影片中，圆心看起来没有移动。在现实世界中，圆心正在绕着圆移动。假设它以某个速度V移动。这个点的速度是多少？它是零，那是因为它是无滑动滚动的。如果它有任何方向的分量，那就是滑动。我的意思是，我认为他们应该在问题中明确说明这一点，但当你改变参考系时，相对速度不会改变。在影片中，圆心始终具有零速度。所以这个点必须具有负V的速度。这意味着它转动的速度与圆心移动的速度相同。所以如果它们总是以相同的速度移动，它们就必须走相同的总距离。它转动的总距离必须与圆心移动的总距离相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- It turns out that the amount the small circle rotates is always the same as the distance the center travels. All right, so why is this true? Suppose you had a camera and the camera was always pointed at the center. So in your movie, it looks like the center doesn't move. In the real world, the center is going around the circle. Let's say it's going at some speed V. What's the velocity of this point? It's zero, and that's because it's rolling without slipping. If it had any component in that direction, that's what slipping would be. I mean, this is something I think they should have spelled out in the problem, but when you change your frame of reference, the relative velocities don't change. In the movee, the center always has velocity zero. So this point would have to have velocity negative V. So that means the speed that this is turning is the same as the speed the center is moving. So if they always have the same speed, they have to go the same total distance. The total distance this turns has to be the same as the total distance the center moves.</p>
</details>

在这个问题中，小圆的圆心绕着一个半径为4的圆移动。所以圆心移动的总距离是8π。小圆旋转了四次，它的周长是2π。这是相同的数字。如果它无滑动滚动，圆心移动的总距离与它转动的总量相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this problem, the center of the small circle goes around a circle of radius four. So the total distance that the center moves is eight pi. What's the total amount that the small circle rotates? It rotates four times, and its circumference is two pi. It's the same number. If it rolls without slipping, the total distance the center travels is the same as the total amount it turns.</p>
</details>

这总是正确的。一个圆在任何表面上无滑动滚动，无论是多边形还是不规则形状，在外部还是内部，圆心移动的距离都等于圆旋转的量。所以，只需找到这个距离并除以圆的周长，即可得到它旋转了多少次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- And this is always true. Take a circle rolling without slipping on any surface from a polygon to a blob, on the outside or the inside, the distance traveled by the center of the circle is equal to the amount the circle has rotated. So, just find this distance and divide it by the circle circumference to get how many rotations it's made.</p>
</details>

这是一个比我们对硬币悖论的答案（我们称之为N，然后加一）更通用的解决方案，它揭示了这个捷径的来源。如果一个圆在一个形状周围连续滚动，圆心会绕着外部移动，其移动距离恰好增加了圆的一个周长，所以圆心移动的距离就是形状的周长加上圆的周长。当我们最终将其除以圆的周长以获得总旋转次数时，我们得到N加一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is an even more general solution than our answer to the coin paradox where we just took our expected answer, which we'll call N, and added one, and it reveals where this shortcut comes from. If a circle is rolling continuously around a shape, the circle center goes around the outside, increasing its distance traveled by exactly one circumference of the circle so the distance traveled by the circle center is just the perimeter of the shape plus the circle's circumference. When we ultimately divide this by the circle circumference to get the total number of rotations, we get N plus one.</p>
</details>

如果一个圆在一个形状内部连续滚动，圆心移动的距离会减少一个圆的周长，使得总旋转次数为N减一。如果圆在一条直线上滚动，圆心移动的距离等于线的长度，除以圆的周长，就只是N。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If a circle is rolling continuously within a shape, the distance travel by the circle center decreases by one circumference of the circle, making the total number of rotations N minus one. If the circle is rolling along a flat line, the distance travel by the circle center is equal to the length of the line which, divided by the circle circumference, is just N.</p>
</details>

这个普遍原则远远超出了一个数学趣事。事实上，它在天文学中对于精确计时至关重要。当我们计算一年中过去了365天（精确地说是365.24天）时，我们说我们只是在计算地球绕太阳公转一周所做的自转次数。但这并不那么简单。所有这些计数都是从你在地球上的角度进行的。对于一个外部观察者来说，他们会看到地球额外自转一次，以解释它绕太阳的圆形路径。所以，当我们计算一年有365.24个太阳日时，他们计算一年有366.24个**恒星年**（Sidereal year: 地球相对于遥远恒星绕太阳公转一周所需的时间）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This general principle extends far beyond a mathematical fun fact. In fact, it's essential in astronomy for accurate timekeeping. When we count 365 days going by in a year, 365.24, to be precise, we say we're just counting how many rotations the earth makes in one orbit around the sun. But it's not that simple. All this counting is done from the perspective of you on earth. To an external observer, they'll see the earth do one extra rotation to account for its circular path around the sun. So while we count 365.24 days in a year, they count 366.24 days in a year. This is called a Sidereal year, Sidereal meaning with respect to the stars where an external observer would be.</p>
</details>

那么，多出来的那一天去哪里了呢？一个正常的**太阳日**（Solar day: 太阳两次经过地球上同一子午线所需的时间）是太阳再次直接在你上方所需的时间。但地球不只是自转，它同时也在绕太阳公转。所以在24小时的太阳日中，地球实际上必须自转超过360度才能再次使太阳直接位于头顶。但地球的轨道对于遥远的恒星来说是微不足道的。要再次看到一颗星直接位于头顶，地球只需精确自转360度。所以，虽然太阳需要整整24小时才能再次直接位于你上方，但夜晚的一颗星只需23小时56分钟零4秒就能再次位于你上方。那就是一个**恒星日**（Sidereal day: 地球相对于遥远恒星自转一周所需的时间）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what happens to that one extra day? A normal solar day is the time it takes the sun to be directly above you again on earth. But the earth isn't just rotating, it's orbiting the sun at the same time. So in a 24-hour solar day, earth actually has to rotate more than 360 degrees in order to bring the sun directly overhead again. But Earth's orbit is negligible to distant stars. To see a star directly overhead again, Earth just needs to rotate exactly 360 degrees. So while it takes the sun exactly 24 hours to be directly above you again, a star at night takes only 23 hours, 56 minutes, and four seconds to be above you again. That's a Sidereal day.</p>
</details>

这解释了恒星年中多出来的那一天去了哪里。如果我们同时开始一个太阳日和一个恒星日，我们会看到它们在一年中慢慢偏离。六个月后，恒星日会比太阳日提前12小时，这意味着中午会变成午夜，并且它会一直移动，直到最终比太阳日提前整整一天，此时新的一年和轨道开始。365.24个每个24小时的日等于366.24个每个23小时56分钟零4秒的日。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This explains where the extra day goes in the Sidereal year. If we start a solar day and a Sidereal day at the same time, we'd see them slowly diverge throughout the year. After six months, the Sidereal day would be 12 hours ahead of the solar day, meaning that noon would be midnight, and it would keep moving up until it's finally one full day ahead of the solar day, at which point a new year and orbit begins. 365.24 days that are each 24 hours long are equal to 366.24 days that are each 23 hours, 56 minutes, and four seconds long.</p>
</details>

所以在地球上使用恒星时没有意义，因为六个月后，白天和黑夜会完全颠倒。但同样，在追踪太空物体时使用太阳时也毫无用处，因为你观察的区域会在比如今晚10点和明晚10点之间发生变化。所以天文学家使用恒星时来确保他们的望远镜每晚都指向同一片太空区域。所有**地球同步卫星**（Geostationary satellites: 轨道周期与地球自转周期相同，相对地球表面保持静止的卫星），比如用于通信或导航的卫星，都使用恒星时来保持它们的轨道与地球自转同步。所以硬币悖论实际上解释了我们如何在地球上计时以及如何在宇宙中计时之间的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it makes no sense to use Sidereal time on earth, because six months down the line, day and night would be completely swapped. But equally, it's useless to use solar time while tracking objects in space, because the region you're observing would shift between say, 10:00 PM one night and 10:00 PM the next night. So instead, astronomers use Sidereal time for their telescopes to ensure that they're looking at the same region of space each night. And all geostationary satellites, like those used for communication or navigation, they use Sidereal time to keep their orbits locked with the Earth's rotation. So the coin paradox actually explains the difference between how we track time on earth and how we track time in the universe.</p>

### SAT错误的后续影响与标准化考试的未来

1982年SAT的重新计分并非全是好消息。由于第17题被取消，学生的成绩在没有这道题的情况下进行了调整，最终结果上下浮动了800分中的10分。虽然这看起来不多，但一些大学和奖学金会设定严格的最低考试分数线。正如一位招生专家所说：“有些情况下，即使我们认为不合理，10分也可能影响一个人的教育机会。它可能不会让某人进不了法学院，但可能会影响他能去哪所法学院。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The rescoring of the 1982 SAT wasn't all good news. With question 17 scrapped, students' scores were scaled without it, moving their final result up or down by 10 points out of 800. Now, while that doesn't seem like much, some universities and scholarships use strict minimum test score cutoffs. And as one admissions expert put it, "There are instances, even if we do not consider them justified, in which 10 points can have an impact on a person's educational opportunities. It might not keep someone out of law school, but it might affect which one he could go to."</p>
</details>

这个错误不仅导致考试分数受损。据考试服务中心称，“重新计分将花费他们超过10万美元，这笔钱来自考生。第17题的圆周问题远不是SAT上的最后一个错误。但错误很可能是他们目前最不关心的问题。我的意思是，SAT正在慢慢成为过去。COVID-19之后，美国近80%的本科院校不再要求任何标准化考试。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This mistake didn't only cost points off the exam. According to the testing service, "Rescoring would cost them over $100,000, money that came outta the pockets of test takers. The question 17 circle problem was far from the last error on the SAT. But errors are likely the least of their concerns these days. I mean, the SAT is slowly becoming a thing of the past. After COVID-19, nearly 80% of undergraduate colleges in the US no longer require any standardized testing.</p>
</details>

而1982年的那场考试，对某些人来说结果还不错。主持人问：“如果你不介意我问，你的SAT数学考了多少分？”那位数学家回答：“我得了800分。甚至在那之前，我就很清楚我要学数学。我参加了数学竞赛。我真的很喜欢数学。”主持人又问：“你现在还会写数学题吗？”数学家说：“前一阵子我为一场数学竞赛写过题目。”主持人追问：“你写的时候对措辞小心吗？”数学家说：“我希望如此。我努力了。”

<p class="english-text">And that 1982 exam, well, it didn't turn out too badly for some. How did you do on your math SAT, if I can ask? - I got an 800.

I really liked math. - Do you end up writing any math questions these days? - A while back I wrote problems for a math competition. - And were you careful with how you wrote them, the wording? - I hope so.
