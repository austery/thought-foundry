### 中东停火与人质交换

Nathan Hager: Good morning. I'm Nathan Hager.

Nathan Hager: 早上好，我是内森·黑格。

Karen Moscow: And I'm Karen Moscow. Here are the stories we're following today.

Karen Moscow: 我是凯伦·莫斯科。以下是我们今天关注的头条新闻。

Nathan Hager: Karen, we begin in the Middle East where **Hamas** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动组织) has released all 20 living Israeli hostages from the **Gaza Strip** (Gaza Strip: 位于地中海东岸的巴勒斯坦地区) after two years of war.

Nathan Hager: 凯伦，我们从中东开始。在长达两年的战争之后，**哈马斯**已经释放了**加沙地带**中所有20名活着的以色列人质。

Nathan Hager: The release comes as President Donald Trump has arrived in Israel on a Middle East trip to celebrate the ceasefire deal.

Nathan Hager: 此次释放正值唐纳德·特朗普总统抵达以色列，开启中东之行以庆祝停火协议。

Nathan Hager: Now from Bloomberg Middle East correspondent Juman Bersete.

Nathan Hager: 接下来听彭博社中东记者朱曼·伯赛特的报道。

Juman Bersete: President Trump has been saying that this is the end of the war and the beginning of peace, and the expectation is that this is the message he would like to hammer home.

Juman Bersete: 特朗普总统一直表示，这是战争的结束，也是和平的开始，因此，人们预期他希望强调的正是这一信息。

Juman Bersete: The fact is that this really is a turning point for the region, and he has been the only U.S. president able to bring about this development.

Juman Bersete: 事实上，这确实是该地区的一个转折点，而他一直是唯一一位能够促成这一进展的美国总统。

Juman Bersete: The war has been going on for two years now, with multiple failed attempts at negotiations and shuttle diplomacy.

Juman Bersete: 这场战争已经持续了两年，期间多次谈判和穿梭外交尝试均告失败。

Juman Bersete: Things were looking a little hairy a month ago after that DHA attack, when Israel went after senior Hamas officials and negotiators operating in Doha.

Juman Bersete: 一个月前，在以色列追捕在多哈活动的哈马斯高级官员和谈判代表之后，局势一度变得有些紧张。

Juman Bersete: But since then, there's really been a renewed optimism, a renewed push out of the Trump administration to bring about this breakthrough, and all of that came to fruition just in the last couple of days.

Juman Bersete: 但自那时起，特朗普政府重新燃起了乐观情绪，并再次推动实现这一突破，所有这些都在过去几天内得以实现。

Karen Moscow: Bloomberg's Juman Bersete says under the terms of the agreement, once the hostages are freed, Israel is obliged to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and has also agreed to allow much more aid into the devastated Mediterranean territory.

Karen Moscow: 彭博社的朱曼·伯赛特表示，根据协议条款，人质获释后，以色列有义务释放近2000名巴勒斯坦囚犯，并已同意允许更多援助进入这个遭受破坏的地中海地区。

Karen Moscow: Al Jazeera is reporting a group of Palestinian prisoners is now on buses on their way to the West Bank as part of that exchange.

Karen Moscow: 半岛电视台报道称，作为交换的一部分，一群巴勒斯坦囚犯目前正在乘坐巴士前往约旦河西岸。

### 中美贸易关系与政府停摆

Karen Moscow: Nathan, there are new developments on the trade front, and that has stock futures rallying following Friday's selloff on Wall Street.

Karen Moscow: 内森，贸易方面有新的进展，华尔街周五抛售之后，股指期货正在上涨。

Karen Moscow: Right now, **S&P futures** (S&P futures: 标准普尔500指数的期货合约) are up 1.4%.

Karen Moscow: 目前，**标普期货**上涨了1.4%。

Karen Moscow: The White House is signaling it's open to doing a deal with China to calm fresh trade tensions days after announcing new 100% **tariffs** (tariffs: 对进口商品征收的税费) effective November 1st.

Karen Moscow: 白宫表示，在美国宣布自11月1日起实施新的100%**关税**几天后，它对与中国达成协议以平息新的贸易紧张关系持开放态度。

Karen Moscow: The relationship soured last week when China announced new export controls on **rare earths** (rare earths: 一组具有特殊性质的17种金属元素).

Karen Moscow: 上周，中国宣布对**稀土**实施新的出口管制后，两国关系恶化。

Karen Moscow: Speaking to reporters on board **Air Force One** (Air Force One: 美国总统的专机), the president expressed some optimism.

Karen Moscow: 总统在**空军一号**上对记者表示了一些乐观情绪。

President Trump: I think we're going to be fine with China. Look, I have a great relationship with President Xi. He's a very tough man, he's a very smart man. He's a great leader for their country, he's a great leader, and I have a great relationship with him.

President Trump: 我认为我们与中国会相处得很好。你看，我与习主席关系非常好。他是一个非常强硬的人，一个非常聪明的人。他是他们国家一位伟大的领导人，他是一位伟大的领导人，我与他关系很好。

President Trump: I think we'll get it set. I know what happened. I really understand what happened, and I'm not even saying he's wrong, but then we met him with something much tougher than what he did to us.

President Trump: 我想我们会搞定的。我知道发生了什么。我真的明白发生了什么，我甚至不认为他错了，但我们以比他对待我们更强硬的方式回应了他。

Karen Moscow: And President Trump also posted on social media, quote, "Don't worry about China. It will all be fine."

Karen Moscow: 特朗普总统还在社交媒体上发帖称：“别担心中国。一切都会好起来的。”

Nathan Hager: Karen, there's no end to the spending standoff in Washington. This is day 13 of the federal **government shutdown** (government shutdown: 美国政府因预算僵局而部分或全部关闭), and both sides are hardening their positions after the White House ordered the first round of permanent layoffs on Friday.

Nathan Hager: 凯伦，华盛顿的开支僵局没有尽头。这是联邦**政府停摆**的第13天，在白宫周五下令进行第一轮永久性裁员后，双方都强化了立场。

Nathan Hager: Vice President JD Vance is pinning the blame on Democrats.

Nathan Hager: 副总统JD·万斯将责任归咎于民主党。

JD Vance: We're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low-income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security.

JD Vance: 我们正在尽一切努力，确保低收入妇女和儿童获得他们所需的食品服务。我们正在努力确保支付我们军队的薪水，因为这关乎国家安全。

JD Vance: We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused.

JD Vance: 我们也希望我们的人民能拿到他们的薪水。这是我们一直关注的焦点。

JD Vance: And unfortunately, what that does mean, Margaret, is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off.

JD Vance: 玛格丽特，不幸的是，这意味着一些联邦公务员将不得不被解雇。

Nathan Hager: Vice President JD Vance discussed the shutdown with Margaret Brennan on CBS's Face the Nation, as heard on Bloomberg radio.

Nathan Hager: 正如彭博广播电台所报道，副总统JD·万斯在哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的《面对全国》节目中与玛格丽特·布伦南讨论了政府停摆问题。

Nathan Hager: But Democrats are sticking to their demand that Republicans negotiate an extension of healthcare subsidies before they'll agree to a stop-gap spending bill.

Nathan Hager: 但民主党坚持要求共和党在同意一项临时支出法案之前，必须就延长医疗保健补贴进行谈判。

Nathan Hager: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries addressed that on Fox News Sunday, also heard on Bloomberg Radio.

Nathan Hager: 众议院少数党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯在福克斯新闻周日节目中谈到了这一点，该节目也在彭博广播电台播出。

Hakeem Jeffries: Open enrollment starts on November 1st. Tens of millions of Americans are receiving notices right now that their premiums, co-pays, and deductibles are about to explode, which is why we need to address it.

Hakeem Jeffries: 公开注册将于11月1日开始。数千万美国人现在正收到通知，他们的保费、自付额和免赔额即将飙升，这就是我们需要解决这个问题的原因。

Hakeem Jeffries: Even Marjorie Taylor Greene agrees that we have to address this health insurance crisis right now.

Hakeem Jeffries: 甚至马乔里·泰勒·格林也同意，我们必须立即解决这场医疗保险危机。

Karen Moscow: House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. And as the shutdown continues, military service members are set to miss their first paychecks on Wednesday.

Karen Moscow: 众议院民主党领袖哈基姆·杰弗里斯。随着政府停摆的继续，军方服役人员将于周三错过他们的第一笔薪水。

Karen Moscow: President Trump says his administration has found the funds to pay them, but it's not clear if they'll receive full paychecks or whether the president has the legal authority to deliver them.

Karen Moscow: 特朗普总统表示，他的政府已找到资金支付他们，但尚不清楚他们是否会收到全额薪水，或者总统是否有法律授权发放这些款项。

### 欧洲政治与美国天气警报

Nathan Hager: Let's go to Europe now, Karen. And President Macron has announced a new French cabinet, including his last prime minister, Sebastian Leornneu.

Nathan Hager: 凯伦，现在我们转向欧洲。马克龙总统已经宣布了新的法国内阁名单，其中包括他上一任总理塞巴斯蒂安·勒科尔尼。

Nathan Hager: The announcement comes amidst growing pressure to prevent a political crisis and pass a budget.

Nathan Hager: 此次宣布正值阻止政治危机和通过预算的压力日益增大之际。

Nathan Hager: And Bloomberg's Caroline Conan has more from Paris.

Nathan Hager: 彭博社的卡罗琳·科南从巴黎带来更多报道。

Caroline Conan: I don't know if you know the movie "Groundhog Day", but it feels like this in France at the moment, kind of living the same day again and again.

Caroline Conan: 我不知道你是否看过电影《土拨鼠之日》，但目前法国的感觉就像这样，一遍又一遍地重复着同一天。

Caroline Conan: So, after he resigned last Monday, Leornneu was appointed again on Friday night around 10 p.m. French time, saying he accepted the mission out of duty, that his only mission would be to pass a budget.

Caroline Conan: 因此，在上周一辞职后，勒科尔尼于法国时间周五晚上10点左右再次被任命，他表示接受这项任务是出于职责，而他唯一的任务将是通过预算。

Caroline Conan: And Bloomberg's Caroline Conan says it all leaves Leornneu tasked with getting a budget approved before the end of the year, as well as fending off a no-confidence vote later this week.

Caroline Conan: 彭博社的卡罗琳·科南表示，这一切都使得勒科尔尼的任务是在年底前获得预算批准，并抵御本周晚些时候的不信任投票。

Nathan Hager: And back here in the U.S., Karen, a **nor'easter** (nor'easter: 在美国东北部和加拿大东部形成的一种强风暴) is churning up the East Coast, prompting declarations of a state of emergency in New Jersey and parts of New York State.

Nathan Hager: 凯伦，回到美国，一场**东北风暴**正在东海岸肆虐，促使新泽西州和纽约州部分地区宣布进入紧急状态。

Nathan Hager: Let's get the very latest from Bloomberg meteorologist Rob Carolyn. Good morning, Rob.

Nathan Hager: 让我们听听彭博社气象学家罗布·卡罗琳的最新报道。罗布，早上好。

Rob Carolyn: Good morning, Nathan. We have an area of low pressure this morning which is east of Atlantic City.

Rob Carolyn: 早上好，内森。今天早上，在大西洋城以东有一个低压区。

Rob Carolyn: It's producing rain from southern New England across the New York City area down the coast all the way to Washington.

Rob Carolyn: 它正在给新英格兰南部、纽约市地区，沿着海岸一直到华盛顿带来降雨。

Rob Carolyn: This storm system is going to be moving very, very slowly, so it looks like more rain and wind throughout the day from the Boston area through New York City and on into Washington.

Rob Carolyn: 这个风暴系统将非常缓慢地移动，因此从波士顿地区经过纽约市一直到华盛顿，全天都将有更多的降雨和大风。

Rob Carolyn: We'll see coastal areas seeing winds at times over 30 mph.

Rob Carolyn: 沿海地区有时会看到风速超过每小时30英里。

Rob Carolyn: The New York City area is under a wind advisory through 6 p.m. Eastern.

Rob Carolyn: 纽约市地区在东部时间下午6点前处于大风警报之下。

Rob Carolyn: Long Island, it's a high wind warning through 2:00 p.m. this afternoon.

Rob Carolyn: 长岛今天下午2点前处于强风警告之下。

Karen Moscow: Rob, when do you expect all this to end then?

Karen Moscow: 罗布，你预计这一切什么时候结束呢？

Rob Carolyn: It looks like the rain will come to an end as showers tonight, Nathan, in the district and also in the New York City area.

Rob Carolyn: 内森，今晚该地区和纽约市的降雨似乎会以阵雨的形式结束。

Rob Carolyn: But rain is likely to linger across Boston right on in through Tuesday evening. I'm Rob Carolyn, Bloomberg Radio.

Rob Carolyn: 但波士顿地区的降雨可能会一直持续到周二晚上。我是罗布·卡罗琳，彭博广播电台。

Nathan Hager: All right, Rob, thank you.

Nathan Hager: 好的，罗布，谢谢你。

John Tucker: 但经济学家们也预计，今年的就业增长将放缓至平均每月仅6万人。

John Tucker: The job growth has slowed markedly in recent months, and that's a trend that prompted the **Fed** (Fed: 美联储，美国中央银行系统) to lower interest rates in September.

John Tucker: 近几个月来，就业增长显著放缓，这一趋势促使**美联储**在9月份降低了利率。

John Stashour: 谢谢，凯伦。**美联冠军赛**正在多伦多进行，西雅图在该系列赛中的第一球就被多伦多的乔治·斯普林格打出全垒打。

John Stashour: But the Blue Jays only had one hit the rest of the way, and the Mariners won game one, three to one.

Nathan Hager: Good morning. I'm Nathan Hager.

Nathan Hager: 早上好，我是内森·黑格。

Nathan Hager: "A great and beautiful day, a new beginning." That was the message from President Trump as he arrived in Israel to celebrate the ceasefire in Gaza, which he says he is confident will hold.

Nathan Hager: “美好的一天，新的开始。”这是特朗普总统抵达以色列庆祝加沙停火时的信息，他表示对停火能够持续抱有信心。

President Trump: Everybody is happy, whether it's Jewish or Muslim or the Arab countries. Every country is dancing in the streets, and it's a point in time I don't think you'd ever see it again.

President Trump: 每个人都很高兴，无论是犹太人、穆斯林还是阿拉伯国家。每个国家都在街上欢庆，这是一个我认为你再也看不到的时刻。

Nathan Hager: That was President Trump aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel, where he is now due to address the **Knesset** (Knesset: 以色列的立法机关).

Nathan Hager: 那是特朗普总统在前往以色列的空军一号上所说的话，他现在将在那里向**以色列议会**发表讲话。

Nathan Hager: Joining us this morning from Tel Aviv is Bloomberg News Israel Bureau Chief Ethan Bronner.

Nathan Hager: 今天早上从特拉维夫连线我们的是彭博新闻社以色列分社社长伊桑·布朗纳。

Nathan Hager: And Ethan, as we await those comments from President Trump, get us up to speed on where we are in the ceasefire, in the implementation.

Nathan Hager: 伊桑，在我们等待特朗普总统的评论之际，请向我们介绍一下停火进展和实施情况的最新信息。

Nathan Hager: What is the latest? Good morning.

Nathan Hager: 最新情况如何？早上好。

Ethan Bronner: Morning, Nathan. So, yes, the ceasefire has been holding for several days.

Ethan Bronner: 早上好，内森。是的，停火已经持续了几天。

Ethan Bronner: 20 Israeli hostages, all of those who were still alive, are out of captivity.

Ethan Bronner: 20名以色列人质，所有幸存者都已脱离囚禁。

Ethan Bronner: And the seven that have already arrived in Israel, the 13 others are on their way.

Ethan Bronner: 其中七人已抵达以色列，其余13人正在途中。

Ethan Bronner: They look healthier than many had feared. They're on their feet, they're speaking.

Ethan Bronner: 他们看起来比许多人担心的要健康。他们能站立，能说话。

Ethan Bronner: And Israel is beginning the process of freeing some 2,000, just under 2,000, Palestinian prisoners.

Ethan Bronner: 以色列正在开始释放约2000名（略低于2000名）巴勒斯坦囚犯的进程。

Ethan Bronner: At the same time, President Trump is here. He's about to address the parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem.

Ethan Bronner: 同时，特朗普总统也在这里。他即将向耶路撒冷的议会，即以色列议会发表演讲。

Ethan Bronner: He's just met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the announcement is now that in addition to all these Western and Arab countries and President Trump going to Egypt, Prime Minister Netanyahu is also going to go to that ceremony.

Ethan Bronner: 他刚刚会见了内塔尼亚胡总理，现在宣布的是，除了所有这些西方和阿拉伯国家以及特朗普总统将前往埃及外，内塔尼亚胡总理也将出席那场仪式。

Ethan Bronner: It was not originally planned, and there's also going to be a Palestinian leader there, Mahmoud Abbas. So what's going to come of this? We shall have to see.

Ethan Bronner: 这原本不在计划之中，而且届时还将有一位巴勒斯坦领导人马哈茂德·阿巴斯出席。那么，这会带来什么结果呢？我们拭目以待。

Nathan Hager: While we wait to see, what are you watching for in terms of whether this ceasefire continues to hold?

Nathan Hager: 在我们等待结果的同时，您在关注哪些方面来判断停火能否继续维持？

Ethan Bronner: Well, the first thing to know is that the goal of Israel, and in theory both of the United States and all of those who declared, who signed on to the so-called New York declaration at the U.N. General Assembly, is to remove Hamas from power in Gaza.

Ethan Bronner: 首先要知道的是，以色列的目标，理论上也是美国以及所有在联合国大会上签署所谓纽约宣言的国家的目标，是将哈马斯从加沙的权力中移除。

Ethan Bronner: But within minutes of the ceasefire beginning in Gaza, Hamas operatives, well armed with Kalashnikovs, took over the streets of Gaza City and of much of Gaza.

Ethan Bronner: 但在加沙停火开始的几分钟内，全副武装的哈马斯武装分子就控制了加沙市和加沙大部分地区的街道。

Ethan Bronner: And they are also now in the process of clashing with some of the clans that had said they were opposed to Hamas.

Ethan Bronner: 他们现在也正在与一些曾表示反对哈马斯的部族发生冲突。

Ethan Bronner: So it feels like the ability to remove Hamas from power is not going to be simple, and that's going to be a major issue going forward.

Ethan Bronner: 因此，将哈马斯从权力中移除的能力似乎不会那么简单，这将是未来一个主要问题。

Nathan Hager: On his way to Israel aboard Air Force One, we heard President Trump say the war is over.

Nathan Hager: 在前往以色列的空军一号上，我们听到特朗普总统说战争已经结束了。

Nathan Hager: What will you be watching for in terms of whether we get to that point where we can actually say this is more than just an open-ended ceasefire?

Nathan Hager: 您将关注哪些方面，来判断我们是否能达到那个阶段，真正地说这不仅仅是一个不设期限的停火？

Ethan Bronner: I think that they're either going to have to adjust their goals of what the war end means, that is to say, leave Hamas in some position relating to the Palestinian Authority or some multinational thing.

Ethan Bronner: 我认为他们要么必须调整他们对战争结束意味着什么的目标，也就是说，让哈马斯在与巴勒斯坦权力机构或某个多国实体相关的某种位置上。

Ethan Bronner: We don't know, but from Israel's perspective, until now, this has not been acceptable.

Ethan Bronner: 我们不知道，但从以色列的角度来看，到目前为止，这是不可接受的。

Ethan Bronner: Now, will it be possible that Israel will be told, "Just hold off for a while while we internationalize this, and we're going to rebuild the Gaza Strip and so on"?

Ethan Bronner: 那么，以色列是否有可能被告知：“在我们使此事国际化期间，暂时搁置一下，我们将重建加沙地带等等”？

Ethan Bronner: Possibly. I mean, one of the reasons Prime Minister Netanyahu did not want to go to Egypt is he did not want to take part in this kind of ceremony.

Ethan Bronner: 有可能。我的意思是，内塔尼亚胡总理不想去埃及的原因之一是，他不想参加这种仪式。

Ethan Bronner: He's always opposed internationalizing the conflict, but now that is changing with perhaps the help of President Trump.

Ethan Bronner: 他一直反对冲突国际化，但现在，在特朗普总统的帮助下，这种情况正在改变。
