### 进化在行动：抗生素抗性与长期实验的序章

这些细菌正在不断适应浓度越来越高的抗生素环境。当它们遇到第一条抗生素带时，细菌停止生长，但随后出现了一个能够在抗生素中存活的突变体。接着，又发生了另一次突变，现在这些细菌能够承受十倍浓度的抗生素，然后是一百倍，最终，在仅仅11天的进化之后，这些细菌能够存活于比最初能杀死它们的抗生素强一千倍的环境中。你正在亲眼目睹进化的过程。

<p class="english-text">These are bacteria growing into increasingly concentrated antibiotics. The bacteria stop growing when they hit the first antibiotic strip, but then a mutant appears capable of surviving in the antibiotic. Then another mutation occurs and now the bacteria can survive 10 times the concentration, then a hundred times, and finally, after just 11 days of evolution, these bacteria can survive antibiotics a thousand times stronger than what would have killed them at the start. You're watching evolution in action.</p>

### 伦斯基实验：33年的大肠杆菌进化之旅

这位是理查德·伦斯基（Richard Lenski）。他于33年前启动了这个实验，并与他的同事团队一起，从那时起即使在周末也一直维持着实验的进行。在这个实验室里，有12个装有活体**大肠杆菌**（E. coli: 一种常见的肠道细菌）的培养瓶。它们是少数幸运儿，是在实验室中经历了三十多年进化的幸存者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is Richard Lenski. He started the experiment 33 years ago, and along with a team of colleagues, he has kept it going even on weekends ever since. In this lab are 12 flasks of live E. coli bacteria. They are the lucky few, the ones that have survived over three decades of evolution in a lab.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “所以，我们有12条长期演化谱系。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there are 12 long-term lines.</p>
</details>

1988年，一个共同的祖先产生了这12个独立的菌群。从那天起，它们就独立地生长和分裂。那么，它们是如何进化的呢？还有其他长期运行的进化实验，例如自1896年以来，伊利诺伊大学（University of Illinois）的科学家们一直在选择性地培育玉米，但它们每年只经历一代。而这些细菌每天会经历六到七代。因此，在33年之后，这些培养瓶中的细菌已经达到了第74,500代。如果这些是人类的世代，那将代表150万年的人科动物进化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1988, a single common ancestor spawned these 12 separate populations. And ever since that day, they have been growing and dividing independently. So how have they evolved? There are other long running evolution experiments like since 1896, scientists at the University of Illinois have selectively bred corn, but they get only one generation per year, whereas these bacteria go through six or seven generations a day. So after 33 years, the bacteria in these flasks are generation 74,500. If those were human generations, it would represent 1.5 million years of hominid evolution.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “我们开始实验的做法是，将大量的细菌稀释到**培养皿**（Petri dish: 用于微生物培养的扁圆形玻璃或塑料容器）中，每个独立的细胞都会形成一个菌落。然后我们从一个菌落中取一点来开始一个菌群，从另一个菌落中取一点来开始另一个菌群，但实际上它们都始于单个细胞。这一点很重要，因为这意味着如果我们看到在重复的菌群中发生相同的事情，那并不是因为它们最初具有相同的遗传变异，也不是自然选择只是反复地筛选出相同的东西。实际上，你必须有独立的突变，才能产生这些竞争优势，无论它是什么，才能在12个重复菌群中产生这种可重复性。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we do to start the experiment is we dilute a large population of bacteria onto a Petri dish and each individual cell makes a colony. And so then we take a little bit from one colony to start one population, a little bit from another colony to start another population, but effectively they all started from individual cells. And that's important because it means if we see the same thing happening in replicate populations, it's not because they started out with the same genetic variants and natural selection just fished out the same thing over and over. You actually had to have independent mutations that would give rise to these competitive advantages, whatever it might be that would produce the repeatability across the 12 replicate populations.</p>
</details>

实验室环境与细菌通常所处的环境非常不同。它简单得多，没有其他生物存在，它们被保持在37摄氏度，并生活在相同的溶液中，这种溶液是葡萄糖、磷酸钾、**柠檬酸盐**（citrate: 柠檬酸的盐类，常用于螯合金属离子）以及其他一些物质的混合物。它们唯一的碳源是有限的葡萄糖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The lab environment is very different from the one the bacteria are used to. It's much simpler, there are no other organisms present, they're kept at 37 degrees Celsius, and they live in the same solution, a mixture including glucose, potassium phosphate, citrate, and a few other things. Their only carbon source is glucose, which is limited.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “最重要的是，消耗葡萄糖并将其转化为后代，尽可能快地复制，这基本上就是我们似乎一直在选择的目标。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Above all else, consuming that glucose and converting it to offspring, replicating as fast as possible has been essentially what we seem to be selecting for.</p>
</details>

### 实验的日常操作与突变的力量

每天，在每个培养瓶中，细菌分裂六到七次，使其数量增加一百倍。通常我们认为世代受时间限制，但对于这些细菌来说，它们受可用资源的限制。如果它们有十倍的溶液，它们的数量会额外增加十倍。然后，在过去33年的几乎每一天，这个转移过程都在进行。每个培养瓶中0.1毫升或1%的溶液被转移到一个含有相同溶液的无菌新培养瓶中。这实际上将细菌稀释了一百倍。这为它们提供了生长和再次分裂所需的空间和资源，使其数量增加一百倍，然后第二天重复相同的过程。之后每天如此，甚至在周末，这个过程已经持续了三十多年。那些没有被转移到新培养瓶中的细菌，即99%的细菌，会发生什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every day in each flask the bacteria divide six or seven times, which increases their numbers a hundred fold. Normally we think of generations as being limited by the time that has elapsed, but in the case of these bacteria, they're limited by the resources available to them. If they had 10 times the solution, they would increase their numbers an additional 10 times. Then almost every day for the past 33 years this transfer process has taken place. 0.1 milliliters or 1% of the solution from each flask is transferred to a sterile new flask containing the same solution. It essentially dilutes the bacteria a hundred fold. This gives them the space and resources they need to grow and divide again, increasing their population a hundred times before this same process is repeated the next day. And then the day after that and the day after that, even on weekends, this process has been going on for over three decades. What happens to bacteria that are not transferred to the new flasks, the 99%?</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “那是高压灭菌室。”

<p class="english-text">Is this like a bacterial crematorium?</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “是的，是的，没错。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</p>
</details>

你可以想象，如果科学家们不这样做，而是每天给所有细菌一百倍的溶液来生长，那么实验很快就会变得无法管理。第二天，你需要一立方米的溶液，但到第13天，实验的体积将是地球的十倍。到第42天，实验将充满整个可观测宇宙。对我来说，遗传学的整个理念似乎是让它们保持不变，并且突变是罕见的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can imagine if the scientists didn't do this, but instead gave all the bacteria a hundred times more solution to grow on every day, well, the experiment would soon become unmanageable. On day two, you would need a cubic meter of solution, but by day 13 the experiment would be 10 times the volume of earth. And by day 42, the experiment would fill up the entire observable universe. To me it seems like the whole idea of genetics is for them to stay constant and for mutations to be rare.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “是的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

然而在你的实验中，它们似乎并不罕见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yet in your experiment it seems they're not rare.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “我们估计，在我们的细菌中，大约只有百分之一或千分之一的细胞会发生哪怕一个突变。所以这并不多。相比之下，在人类中，据估计我们的每个后代可能有10、20、50个新的突变。所以细菌是极其保守的，但即使在一个小小的培养瓶中，它们也有数十亿个。因此，如果你有千分之一的突变机会，并且有十亿个个体，那么每天在这些培养瓶中的一个里，我们可能会有一百万个新的突变。所以这是自然选择可以作用的大量变异。也许其中一半的突变对细菌在特定环境中生长和繁衍的能力没有任何影响。它们可能是那些在野外环境中会产生影响的突变，但这是一个非常简单的环境，也许这些基因甚至没有表达。另一半的突变，非常粗略地说，可能实际上是有害突变。它们使细菌成为一个较差的竞争者，但在每天发生的一百万个突变中，也许有10个，也许有100个，也许有1000个突变实际上改变了细胞中的某些东西，使细菌比它们的祖先具有竞争优势。然后这些突变在一天之内生长。然后每天99%的菌群被淘汰。幸运的1%得以存活，如果这幸运的1%中包括前一天生长速度比其他细菌快10%的个体，那么它对下一个培养瓶、第二天的新培养基的贡献概率就会更高，它将继续以10%的速度更快地生长，这通过指数过程复合。所以突变在它们第一次发生时确实非常罕见，其中许多会丢失，但一旦它们变得普遍，如果它们具有竞争优势，它们就会席卷整个菌群。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we estimate that in our bacteria only about one out of maybe a hundred or one out of a thousand cells will have even a single mutation. So that's not very much. By contrast, in humans it's estimated that each one of our offspring has perhaps 10, 20, 50 new mutations. So the bacteria are extremely conservative, but they're also billions of them and even a tiny flask. And so if you have a chance in a thousand of mutating and you have a billion individuals, then every day in one of these flasks we might have a million new mutations. So that's a lot of variation on which natural selection can act. Maybe half of those mutations have no effect whatsoever on the bacteria's ability to grow and thrive in that particular environment. They might be mutations that would matter out in the great outdoors, but this was a very simple environment, maybe those genes aren't even expressed. Another half of the mutations speaking very, very roughly might actually be deleterious mutations. They make the bacteria an inferior competitor, but there's maybe out of those million mutations that occur every day, maybe there's 10, maybe there's a hundred, maybe there's a thousand of them that actually change something in the cell that gives the bacteria a competitive advantage over their progenitors. And those then grow over the course of that day. Then every day 99% of the population is eliminated. It's lucky 1% prevails, and if those lucky 1% include one of the guys from the previous day that was growing at 10% faster than the other guys, it has a higher probability of contributing to that next flask, the next day's flask and in the fresh medium, and it will continue to grow faster at a 10% clip, and that compounds by an exponential process. So the mutations, y'know, are really rare when they first occur and many of them are lost, but once they get common if they have that competitive advantage, they'll just sweep through the population.</p>

### 衡量适应性：“时间旅行”与细菌格斗俱乐部

但是，你如何知道细菌确实具有竞争优势呢？我的意思是，你如何判断它们是否越来越适应其环境？这就是细菌独特特性之一发挥作用的地方。它们可以长时间冷冻，然后复活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But how do you know that the bacteria actually have a competitive advantage? I mean, how can you tell that they're getting better suited to their environment? Well, this is where one of the unique properties of bacteria come in. They can be frozen for long periods of time and then revived.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “所以它们在这里以**悬浮动画**（suspended animation: 一种生命活动暂时停止的状态）的形式储存。这些是存放来自不同世代细菌冷冻样本的架子。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so they're stored in suspended animation here. So these are the racks that contain the frozen samples of the bacteria from the various generations.</p>
</details>

每隔500代，大约75天，他们就会冷冻每个菌群的一个样本。通过冷冻前几代，伦斯基和他的团队拥有了一个冷冻的化石记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every 500 generations, roughly 75 days, they freeze a sample of each population. By freezing previous generations, Lenski and his team have a frozen fossil record.</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “所以我们三十多年前的样本仍然完全存活。这使我们能够做到我喜欢称之为‘时间旅行’的事情。我们真的可以比较生活在不同时间点的生物。所以我们可以让第70,000代的细菌与它们的祖先进行竞争。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So our samples from over 30 years ago remain perfectly viable. And so that gives us an ability to do what I like to call time travel. We can literally compare organisms that lived at different points in time. So we can compete bacteria from generation 70,000 against their ancestor.</p>
</details>

没错。他们衡量适应性的方式是让当前一代细菌与老一代细菌竞争。这就像一个奇怪的细菌格斗俱乐部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. The way they measure fitness is by competing the current generation of bacteria against older generations. It's like a strange bacteria fight club.</p>
</details>

他们解冻老一代，将其与当前一代混合在一个培养瓶中，然后将溶液样本接种到平板上，以查看两种菌群在开始时的相对丰度。然后他们将培养瓶孵育一天，再重新接种。关键是比较它们的相对生长速率，哪一代能更好地利用葡萄糖并更快地分裂？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They thaw out the old generation, mix it into a flask with the current generation, and then plate out a sample of the solution to see the relative abundances of the two populations at the start. Then they incubate the flask for a day, and then plate them out again. And the point is to compare their relative growth rates, which generation was better able to utilize the glucose and divide faster?</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “那么，你到底如何区分进化的细菌和它的祖先呢？它们会向你挥舞小旗子说：‘嘿，我是进化的家伙’吗？当然不会。但我们有这个嵌入实验中的颜色标记。所以我们的六个菌群在某种**琼脂平板**（agar plate: 含有琼脂的培养基平板，用于微生物培养）上会形成红色菌落，另外六个会形成白色菌落。我们有一个红色菌落的祖先版本和一个白色菌落的祖先版本。我们可以让一个红色进化的菌群与白色祖先竞争，或者一个白色进化的菌群与红色祖先竞争，这样我们就可以区分它们。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, how the heck do you tell the evolve bacterium from its ancestor? Do they wave little flags at you and say, "Hey, I'm the evolved guy." And of course they don't. But what we have is this color marker embedded in the experiment. So six of our populations on a certain kind of agar plate make red colonies and six of them make white colonies. And we have one version of the ancestor that makes red colonies and one that makes white colonies. We can compete one of the red evolved populations against the white ancestor, or one of the white evolved populations against the red ancestor and we can distinguish them.</p>
</details>

在这种情况下，很明显，进化的红色菌群胜过了它们的白色祖先。现在，为了确定胜者，所有的菌落都由人工计数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this case, it's clear that the evolved red population outcompeted their white ancestor. Now, to determine the winner, all of the colonies are counted by hand.</p>

### 突破性发现：柠檬酸盐代谢与超变异性

那么，这个实验最早的重大发现是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what was the earliest sort of big findings from the experiment?</p>
</details>

Richard Lenski: “我们发现的第一件事，虽然对此没有任何疑问，但它是你能想象到的，对达尔文自然选择适应性最直接的证明之一。是的，它们随着时间的推移变得更具竞争力。在其他进化实验中，这是一个普遍的观察结果，即在新环境中的进化会有一个迅猛的开始，然后随着时间的推移趋于减缓。所以我们重复了这一观察结果，我曾设想长期谱系最终会趋于平稳。我甚至考虑过停止实验，但我从同事和我的妻子玛德琳（Madeline）那里得到了明智的建议，‘让我们继续下去’。所以我同意了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing we found, not that there was any doubt about it, but it's one of the most direct demonstrations of Darwinian adaptation by natural selection, you can imagine. Yes, they're getting to be better competitors over time. It's a common observation in other evolution experiments that evolution in a new environment gets off to a rip-roaring start and then tends to slow down over time. And so we repeated that observation and I imagined that the longterm lines would actually sort of flat line at some point. And I actually thought about stopping the experiment, but I got wise advice from colleagues and from my wife, Madeline, let's keep it going. And so I agreed to that.</p>

</details>

Richard Lenski: “12个谱系中的一个突然开始消耗第二种碳源——柠檬酸盐，这种物质在整个实验过程中一直存在于我们的培养基中。它在培养基中作为一种**螯合剂**（chelating agent: 能与金属离子结合形成螯合物的物质），用于结合培养基中的金属。但**大肠杆菌**（E. coli）根据其原始物种定义是无法做到这一点的。但有一天我们发现其中一个培养瓶的**浊度**（turbidity: 液体中悬浮颗粒的量度，使其变得浑浊）增加了。我以为我们可能混入了污染物。一些细菌进入了其中，能够食用柠檬酸盐，从而增加了浊度。我们回到冷冻库，重新启动了进化过程。我们还开始检查这些细菌，看它们是否真的是**大肠杆菌**。是的，它们是**大肠杆菌**。它们真的是来自祖先菌株的**大肠杆菌**吗？是的。所以我们开始对其进行遗传学研究。非常清楚的是，我们的一个细菌谱系基本上，我喜欢说，有一天醒来，吃掉了葡萄糖，并且不像任何其他谱系那样，发现还有这种美味的柠檬甜点，它们开始消耗它，并获得了第二种碳和能量来源。扎克（Zack）对为什么进化出这种能力花了这么长时间，以及为什么只有一个菌群进化出这种能力的问题很感兴趣。他回到冷冻库，从最终进化出这种能力的谱系中挑选了细菌个体或克隆。然后他尝试从不同的时间点重新进化这种能力。所以从某种意义上说，这几乎就像，嗯，就像倒带一样，让我们回到电影的第五分钟。让我们回到电影的第十分钟，第二十分钟，看看结果是否会根据我们何时进行而改变，因为这种柠檬酸盐**表型**（phenotype: 生物体可观察到的特征）的进化，基本上有两种相互竞争的解释，解释了为什么它如此难以进化。一种是它只是一个非常罕见的突变。它不像那种只改变一个字母的突变。它可能需要翻转一段特定的DNA，并且必须有精确的断裂点和精确的另一个断裂点。那是唯一的方法。所以这是一个罕见的事件，但它可能在任何时间点发生。另一种假设是，发生了一系列事件，使得一些原本普通的事情变得可能，而这在开始时是不可能的，因为一个突变只有在生物体的其他方面发生变化后才会产生这种效果。长话短说，事实证明，这是一个如此难以进化的性状，因为这两种假设都是正确的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the 12 lineages suddenly began to consume a second carbon source, citrate, which had been present in our medium throughout the experiment. It's in the medium is what's called a chelating agent to bind metals in the medium. But E. coli going back to its original definition as a species is incapable of that. But one day we found one of our flasks had more turbidity. I thought we probably had a contaminant in there. Some bacterium had gotten in there that could eat the citrate and, therefore, had raised the turbidity. We went back into the freezer and restarted evolution. We also started checking those bacteria to see whether they really were E. coli. Yep, they were E. Coli. Were the really E. coli that had come from the ancestral strain? Yep. So we started doing genetics on it. It was very clear that one of our bacteria lineages had essentially I like to say sort of woken up one day, eaten the glucose, and unlike any of the other lineages discovered that there was this nice lemony dessert, and they'd begun consuming that and getting a second source of carbon and energy. Zack was interested in the question of why did it take so long to evolve this and has only one population evolve that ability? He went into the freezer and he picked bacterial individuals or clones from that lineage that eventually evolved that ability. And then he tried to evolve that ability again starting from different points. So in a sense, it's almost like, well, it's like rewinding the tape and starting let's go back to the minute five of the movie. Let's go back to a minute 10 of the movie, minute 20 of the movie and see if the result changes depending on when we did it, because this citrate phenotype there were essentially two competing explanations for why it was so difficult to evolve. One was that it was just a really rare mutation. It wasn't like one of these just change one letter. It was something where maybe you had to flip a certain segment of DNA and you had to have exactly this break point and exactly that break point. And that was the only way to do it. So it was a rare event, but it could have happened at any point in time. The alternative hypothesis is that, well, what happened was a series of events that made something perfectly ordinary become possible that wasn't possible at the beginning because a mutation would only have this effect once other aspects of the organism had changed. To make a long story short, it turns out it's such a difficult trait to evolve because both of those hypotheses are true.</p>
</details>

这个实验还揭示了其他令人惊讶的发现。例如，细菌的数量并没有随着时间增加，反而减少了，但每个个体细菌都变大了。12个菌群中有六个进化出了**超变异性**（hypermutability: 基因突变率远高于正常水平的现象），其突变率比它们的祖先高一百倍，但这些菌群随后又获得了额外的突变，使突变率回落。我的意思是，能够比其他生物更快地进化是有利的，但如果突变率过高，那么后代就会有太多的有害突变。但也许最令人惊讶的发现是那些没有发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The experiment uncovered other surprising findings. Like instead of the bacteria getting more numerous over time, they actually decreased in number, but each individual bacterium got larger. Six of the 12 populations evolved hypermutability, mutation rates a hundred times higher than their ancestors, but these populations subsequently acquired additional mutations that brought the mutation rate back down. I mean, it's advantageous to be able to evolve faster than others, but if the mutation rate is too high, then offspring have too many deleterious mutations. But maybe the most surprising finding of all is what didn't happen.</p>
</details>

### 幂律模型与永无止境的进化

Richard Lenski: “我曾认为它们会趋于平稳的观点被证明是完全错误的。我曾设想了一个非常简单的数学模型。你可以创建一个所谓的**直角双曲线**（rectangular hyperbola: 一种特殊的双曲线，其渐近线互相垂直），它有一个初始的高斜率，然后达到一个**渐近线**（asymptote: 曲线无限接近但永不相交的直线），但也有同样简单的模型。还有一个只有两个参数的模型，称为**幂律模型**（power law model: 描述一个量与另一个量的幂次关系的模型），它说事情会减慢，但没有上限。它说，永远持续下去，事情只会变得更快，但进一步改进的速度会越来越慢。事实证明，这个模型比我最初设想的模型更适合我们的数据。而且它不仅更适合，你会说统计学、科学、曲线拟合，它实际上预测了未来。这才是真正酷的地方，因为原始模型，如果你只给它5000代我们的适应性数据，并要求它预测未来，它会说渐近线在这里。但当我们获得更多数据时，不！细菌在这里。它们已经超过了那个渐近线。而这个**幂律模型**，它说事情正在减慢，但永远不会达到渐近线？我们只给它过去数据的十分之一，它就能非常准确地预测到50,000甚至60,000代，这是我们上次查看时的结果。它预测了进化轨迹的未来进程。对我来说，这有点深刻，它改变了我看待这个实验的方式，甚至一点点改变了我看待地球生命的方式。我的意思是，地球上的生命不会停止进化。我们知道这一点。我们知道这一点，但我们认为那是因为有小行星撞击。那是因为有人类影响。那是因为有病毒攻击它们的宿主，而且共同进化导致进化永不停止。世界总是在变化。所以，进化当然永不停止。这100%是真的。但我们的实验表明，即使在没有环境变化的情况下，也有如此多越来越小的机会可以继续取得进展，事实上，即使在恒定环境中，进展也可能永远不会停止。对我来说，这是继续这个实验的原因之一。这个模型是否继续预测未来适应性轨迹的展开？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This view I had that they were flat lining turned out to be quite false. I had sort of imagined a very simple mathematical model. You can create something called a rectangular hyperbola, I guess, which has an initial high slope and then reaches an asymptote, but they're equally simple models. There's a model that also has just two parameters called a power law model that says things slow down, but it doesn't have an upper bound. It says, just keep going for time immemorial, and things will just keep going faster, but at a slower and slower rate of further improvement. And it turned out that model actually fits our data better than that original model I had imagined. And not only does it fit it better, okay, you say statistics, science, fitting curves, it actually predicts the future. And that's what's really cool because the original model, if you give it say just 5,000 generations worth of our fitness data and ask it to predict into the future, it says the asymptote is here. But then when we get more data, no! The bacteria are up here. They've passed that asymptote. Whereas this power law model, which says things are slowing down, but never reaching an asymptote? We give it just 1/10 of our data from the past and it projects very accurately out to 50,000 and even 60,000 generations when we last looked. It predicts sort of the future course of the evolutionary trajectory. And to me, that's kind of profound and it's sort of changed the way I look at this experiment, and even a little bit how I look at life on earth. I mean, life on earth doesn't stop evolving. We know that. And we know that, but we think that's, oh, that's because they're asteroid impacts. That's because of human impacts. That's because they're viruses that are attacking their hosts and that the co-evolution is causing evolution is causing evolution to never stop. The world is always changing. So of course, evolution never stops. And that is 100% true. But what our experiment suggests is that even in the absence of environmental change, there are so many opportunities of smaller and smaller magnitude to continue to make progress that, in fact, progress probably would never stop even in a constant environment. To me, it's one of the reasons to keep this experiment going. Does this model continue to predict the unfolding of the future fitness trajectory?</p>

好的。现在是实验的结论部分，我将用这个紫外线手电筒寻找那些荧光粉。那么，我们关灯吧。哇。这里有很多荧光粉。显然水槽里有很多，但水龙头这里也有，看起来有人擦过把手和水龙头。哦，看看洗碗机。是的，把手上也有。这是一种很好的方式来可视化洗碗布是如何将细菌传播到整个房子里的。什么？看起来像指纹。作为一名父亲，我遇到过很多大麻烦，比如粘乎乎的手和黏糊糊的脸。所以当我的厨房里有脏乱或溢洒时，我选择用Bounty来清理。所以我要感谢Bounty赞助这个视频，也要感谢您的观看。

<p class="english-text">Okay. Now the conclusion of the experiment where I look for that fluorescent powder using this UV torch. So let's hit the lights. (laughs) Whoa. There is a lot of fluorescent powder around here. Obviously there's a lot in the sink, but also here on the tap, it looks like someone wiped down the handle and the faucet. Oh, check out the dishwasher. Yeah, and on the handle. This is a great way of visualizing how dishcloths can spread bacteria around the house. What? (laughs) It looks like finger marks. As a dad, I encounter lots of big messes and sticky hands and slimy faces. So when there is a mess or spill in my kitchen I choose to clean it up with Bounty So I wanna thank Bounty for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.</p>
