### 优质投资的核心：高进入壁垒

大家好，我是尼古拉·坦根（Nikolai Tangan），今天我们请到了一位堪称史上最杰出的投资者之一——克里斯·霍恩（Chris Horn）。他的基金 TCI 不仅是欧洲有史以来最优秀、最成功的基金之一，其同名慈善机构如今也位列全球规模最大的慈善组织之林。克里斯，你持续地为世界带来巨大的积极影响，感谢你的到来。

让我们从投资界开始吧。什么才是一项好的投资？我认为很多人都弄错了这一点，他们常常认为关键在于增长，或者是一些新颖的东西。但在我们看来，这两者本身都无关紧要。最重要的一点，也是我们这类投资不可或缺的，就是高进入壁垒，也就是沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）所说的**护城河**（Moat：指企业抵御竞争对手的持久优势）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm Nikolai Tangan and today we are joined by one of the best investors of all time actually. So Chris Horn, not only is this fund TCI one of the best and most successful funds that Europe has ever seen, but also the charity is one now one of the largest in the world. So uh Chris, you continue to have a immense positive impact on the world. Thanks for coming. Good luck.</p>
<p class="english-text">Let's start with um the investment world. What makes a good investment? I think this is uh something a lot of people uh get wrong. They that's they think it's about growth often. Okay. Or something new. Neither of them those things in themselves are to us um uh matter by themselves. The most important thing and without which it's um in in um for the let's say the types of investing that we do is high barriers to entry the moes that Warren Buffett has talked about.</p>
</details>

当然，在我们深入探讨之前，一个不良资产，比如一块因清算而半价出售的房地产，也能成为一笔好的投资吗？是的。那么，廉价的普通资产是否也有其价值？是的，我们可以称之为以远低于重置成本的价格交易的低质量资产。这种投资方式是可行的，我过去也曾做过，投资于廉价的普通企业或廉价的差劲企业。但我感觉自己对这类投资没有任何信心，因为那些普通企业的盈利能力是不可预测的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now can before we dig into that the can a distressed asset of a you know a piece of real estate that selling at half price because of a liquidation also be a good investment? Yes.</p>
<p class="english-text">So, can there be a role for cheap average assets? Yeah, let's call them lowquality assets which are trading at big discounts to replacement cost. Yes, that that's the that's the type of investing that can work. Yeah. That I've I've done in my time. Yeah. Cheap average businesses or cheap bad businesses. But I'm I don't feel that I can have any confidence in that type of investing. um because the um the earnings power of those averages businesses is unpredictable.</p>
</details>

### 可持续护城河的多种形态

那么，什么是好的护城河呢？最重要的答案是那些可持续的护城河。理想情况下，你希望拥有多重护城河，即多重防御。护城河有很多种形式，它基本上意味着这个业务难以被替代，难以与之竞争。这涉及两个风险：替代风险和竞争风险。从长远来看，这两点变得非常困难，因为竞争会扼杀利润，就这么简单；而替代则会直接消灭你的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so what are good modes? The most important answer is ones that are sustainable. Okay, a lot of people uh and ideally you would have multiple moes, multiple ar pieces of defense and there are many ways is is basically something that means that the business is difficult to replace. Yeah. uh difficult to compete with. Yes. And replace two two substitution risk and competition risk. Y those long-term become different very difficult because why is it so important? Competition kills profits. Yep. That's as simple as that. Substitution eliminates your business.</p>
</details>

我们关注多种多样的护城河。其中一种是大多数投资者，有趣的是，他们实际上并不真正关注的：不可替代的实体资产。我们身处一个人们只看收益，不看资产价值或实体资产的世界。因此，我们相当喜欢基础设施。例如机场，我们的一项投资是西班牙的机场集团 Aena，当时政府将其私有化了。你永远无法在马德里或其他任何地方建造第二个机场。这些都是天然的垄断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we look at um um there there are many many modes. one which most people don't look at uh most investors don't really look at actually interestingly is irreplaceable physical assets. Okay, we're in a world where people uh just look at earnings. They don't look at uh asset value or physical assets and and and uh um and so we like quite a bit of infrastructure. Um airports for example um one of our investments which uh has been um the airport group in Spain where the government privatized. Yes. Ayena and um you just can never they'll never build a second airport at Madrid or any other places. These are, you know, natural monopolies.</p>
</details>

这也适用于收费公路、铁路和电信塔。基础设施有多种形式，比如输电塔，它们很难被竞争，因为它们是天然垄断。当然，其中一些也可能被过度建设，比如有线电视。所以，虽然它是一种基础设施，但你通常需要逐案分析具体细节。想要获得规划许可去建第二个机场是非常罕见的，这在经济上也不成立。我记得希思罗机场为了增加一条跑道挣扎了多久。所以，规划许可正是关键。对于公路来说，建造第二条路没有经济理由，或者你根本没有土地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um so but that also applies to toll roads and railroads and um telecom towers. Um so uh there are many forms of infrastructure transmission towers that um um are hard to compete with because they're natural monopolies where um where um of course some of these things can be overbuilt like cable. So there's a form of infrastructure but it it's it's it's it's usually you have to look at the details of case by case very unusual to try to and usually go and get the planning uh to build a second airport. No economic case to it. I mean I can't remember how long they struggled to get a an extra runway at Heathro. Right. So planning exactly planning and then uh roads there's no economic case to build a second road or you don't have the land. for different uh literally no.</p>
</details>

所以，基础设施，即实体资产，是第一种护城河。第二种是**知识产权**（Intellectual Property, IP），那些非常先进以至于难以复制的知识产权。我们喜欢的一个领域是飞机发动机。这是一个非常复杂的产品，因为材料的复杂性，发动机在极高的温度下运行，以至于金属都会熔化，许多不同的部件必须协同工作，成千上万个复杂的零件。这是一个在窄体发动机领域只有两个玩家，宽体发动机领域也只有两个玩家的行业，并且在过去 50 多年里没有新的进入者。这本身就说明了问题。这是一个巨大的产业，但极其复杂，进入门槛极高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so infrastructure is physical assets is one a second is IP intellectual property that's right and uh which is so advanced okay that it's very difficult to replicate well so what kind of intellectual property are you thinking um one space we like is aircraft engines Um and uh there it is a very complicated product because the um materials complexity the the the the engines run at such high temperatures that metals melt and so many different things have to come together. Yeah. Thousands and thousands of complex parts. So that's one where that's a business where there are only two players in narrow body engines and two in widebody and there have been no new entrance for more than 50 years. The last new entrance was DE and so that tells you something. Yeah, it's a big industry but it's so complex very hard to enter.</p>
</details>

另一个进入壁垒是已安装基础（installed base）。这也适用于飞机发动机业务。一旦这些发动机安装到位，出于各种原因，你就能获得其备件业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another uh barrier to entry is um uh installed base. Okay, which applies to the aircraft engine business. Once those engines are there, they um for various reasons, you get the spare parts business on it.</p>
</details>

规模是另一个进入壁垒，尽管它并不能保证竞争优势。网络效应是另一个重要的进入壁垒，你可以在像 Visa、Meta 这样的资产中看到这一点。品牌是又一个进入壁垒，但我并不是说每个品牌都很强大。但你想想麦当劳，它确实有价值。有些品牌强大且可持续，但并非全部如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um uh another um of uh barriers to entry is scale, although that's that's not a uh a guarantee of of uh um of uh competitive uh moat. Um network effects is another important barrier to entry. You can see this in assets like Visa, Meta. Yeah, two examples of um network effects and brands are another barrier to entry. But I'm not saying every brand is is powerful. But you know, you think about a McDonald's, it's a it has a value. There are some brands which are powerful and sustainable, but not all.</p>
</details>

我再提一个护城河：客户转换成本。以关键任务软件为例，一旦安装，公司会非常不愿意去动它和更换它，因为其复杂性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'll mention one more uh moat which is customer switching costs. Take missionritical software once it's installed. Uh companies are very reluctant to to mess with it and and and switch because of the complexity.</p>
</details>

### 增长的误区与定价权的力量

经常性收入流对你来说有多重要？它很重要，但其重复出现的可预测性并非如此。对我们来说，更重要的是一些稍微不同的东西，那就是“必需的产品或服务”。我们不喜欢那些可有可无的东西。我们长期投资的一个领域是评级机构。这些人基本上是为不同类型的债券提供评级，告诉投资者它是好是坏，是投资级还是非投资级。发行人需要为评级付费，但他们不一定非要在某一年为其债券进行再融资。他们可以推迟，但最终债务必须进行再融资和评级。所以我认为，“必需性”是更重要的一点。不过，我们投资的公司通常确实拥有必需产品的经常性且可预测的收入流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important are recurring revenue streams for you when you look at businesses? It's it is important. Um but the predictability of when they recur is not okay. Let me give you an example. So what's most important for us is something slightly different which is essential product or service. We don't like things which are discretionary. Okay. So one space we've invested in for a long time is rating agencies and here these are the these are the people who basically give kind of character to different type of yeah they say is it good or bad? Yeah. Yeah. To people who invest in bonds, uh they say is it investment grade, non-investment grade, give for research and uh if you like, bless it. And uh there you can actually defer an issuer pays for the rating, but they don't have to um refinance their bonds, which is a big part of it in any given year. M they can delay and defer but eventually the debt has to be refinanced and and and and rated and so there's a there's a and so I think essential need is is is is uh the the the bigger point but uh usually our companies have uh yeah recurring and predictable revenue streams of essential products I yeah.</p>
</details>

那么它们必须增长吗？这取决于估值，不一定，或者说不一定需要高速增长。增长可以来自两个方面：销量和价格。你必须把它分解来看。为什么增长不像投资者通常认为的那么重要？因为你可能会有“无利润的增长”。航空业在过去一百年里增长了很多，航空旅行以每年 5% 的速度持续增长。但作为一个行业，航空公司的累计和集体利润几乎微乎其微。尽管有增长，但进入壁垒非常低。所以，我会说，没有进入壁垒的增长不是你想要的组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so do they have to grow depending on valuation not necessarily um and uh or not not necessarily at a fast rate. Okay? And you and growth can come from two forms, volume and price. So you have to break it down. Now why isn't growth as important as people investors usually assume it to be um because you can have profitless growth. The airline industry over a hundred years has had a lot of growth. Airline travel has grown at 5% a year. Yep. Continues to grow uh consistently. But airlines as a business cumulatively and collectively have made almost you know minimal profits. Yeah. Despite growth because the very low barriers to entry and so um so I I I would say growth without barriers to entry is is not a combination that you you want.</p>
</details>

其中一些业务资本密集度很高，比如建一个机场并不便宜。这对你来说重要吗？嗯，你必须像看待所有事情一样，深入细节。所有机场的起降费都受到监管，但有些机场的非起降费是不受监管的，比如商店、广告、贵宾休息室、停车场。这就是所谓的“双柜台”监管（dual till regulation）：一个柜台受监管，一个不受。那些不受监管的业务资本密集度非常低，资本回报率很高。它们会增长，因为旅行需求越来越大。所以，资本密集度本身只是等式的一部分。但真正压倒一切的，仍然是进入壁垒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of these businesses are quite uh capital intensive like it's not cheap to build an airport. Yeah. Does that matter for you? Well, you have to look at like everything into the detail and some airports uh are um well all airports have regulation on landing charges but some the non-landing charges are unregulated. the shops, the advertising, the the VIP lounges, the parking. Yep. And um the so-called dual till regulation. One till is regulated, one till is unregulated. And those are very low capital in in in in intensity. Yep. It's it's it's uh in effect. Yep. And uh and high returns on capital. They grow um because there's more and more demand for travel. And uh so um so and again capital intensity by itself it's part of the equation. Okay. But it's still um um um and it it it it tells you how valuable growth is. Okay. But what trumps, if you don't mind that expression, what trumps the uh the all of this? Still, it's still a valid expression, don't Yes. What trumps all of this is the the the the the Barry century. Okay.</p>
</details>

我想回到增长可以来自价格和销量这一点。大多数公司没有定价权，他们最多只能按通胀率定价。这就是为什么人们不关注它，他们甚至不看增长来自哪里，只是假设它是销量加通胀。但有一类特殊的超级公司，它们的定价可以超过通货膨胀。正如巴菲特所教导的，这是检验你是否拥有护城河的标准。这种超越通胀的实际定价权可能非常有价值，因为如果你能比通胀高出 1% 的价格，并且你的利润率是 20%，那么你的利润增长将比收入增长快 5%。人们不去深入研究或分析它，因为拥有这种能力的公司太少了。但这是我们很多投资都具备的特点。因为增量定价几乎全是利润，非常有效。这就是为什么你问增长有多重要，如果只是销量增长，但同时我有很强的定价增长，那后者实际上更重要，因为它没有相关的成本，具有杠杆效应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to go back to the the point about growth can come from two forms, price and volume. Okay. And most companies don't have pricing power. They can only price if they're lucky at inflation. And that's why people don't focus on it. They don't even look at where growth comes from. They just assume it's volume plus inflation. But there is a special group of super companies that can price above inflation. And that's as Buffett taught the test of whether you have the moat. Okay. And this real pricing power above inflation can be very valuable because if you can price 1% above inflation and and you have a 20% profit margin, your profits will grow 5% faster than revenue. And um people don't go into it or analyze it because there's so few companies that that have it. But but um this is something we have a you know a lot of our investments have this because incremental pricing is pretty much all profits. That's right. And it's very potent if you have the lower your margin is. So this is why you asked about growth and is it how important if it's if you're asking about volume growth but I and I have low volume growth but I have a lot of pricing growth that's actually more important because of the leveraged effect of there's no cost associated with it.</p>
</details>

### 监管、竞争与理想的商业模式

你投资了很多受监管的业务，比如机场和电力传输公司。这其实是一个普遍的风险。如果你的壁垒太低，竞争或替代会消灭你的业务和投资。如果壁垒太高，监管机构可能会找上门来。每种情况都不同。理想的情况是，存在竞争，但是是弱竞争和“表面竞争”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M regulation. Yes. Um you have been in a lot of regulated businesses. So you mentioned airports, but you've been in Red Electric, which is like electricity transmission company. You have done quite a few of these things. Yes, I have. And actually, it's a general risk. Um because if you have barriers too low, competition or substitution eliminates your business and your investment. Barriers too high, regulators may come knocking on your door. Yep. M every case is different. Yeah. And um the ideal case is you that there is competition but weak competition. And apparent competition. Okay.</p>
</details>

什么是表面竞争？它其实就是弱竞争和理性竞争。举个例子，普惠公司（Pratt and Whitney）与通用电气（GE）和赛峰集团（Safran）竞争，它在新订单中占有 25% 的份额。它有产品，但远不如对手。它有 35% 的发动机停飞，存在多种技术问题，已经失去了很多信任。但它就在那里竞争。在这个行业，价格不是最重要的，可靠性才是。当它挣扎时，它不得不提高价格，因为它面临很多困难。有时，即使存在竞争，竞争对手也会选择不竞争，采取理性的、非价格竞争的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So tell me what is apparent competition? Yeah. Well it it's really weak competition and rational competition. Okay. So the um take some water examples um um uh Pratt and Whitney competes with GE and Saffron. It has a 25% share of new orders. It's it it can as a product, but it's not nearly as as as good. Yeah. It's it's got 35% of its engines grounded, multiple technical problems. just has lost a lot of trust, but it's it's there competing um and uh um a and uh for new engines. Yeah. But price isn't the most important thing in this industry. Reliability is. Yeah. And so you um and so and as it struggles it has to raise prices because it's got to you know lots of difficulties and sometimes where there is competition that competition chooses uh not to compete you know generally speaking not a specific industry um decides to be rational yeah and and and and compete on you know non-pricbased uh uh approach. Okay.</p>
</details>

细节很重要。你可能看到希思罗机场，觉得它完全受监管，所以机场业务不好。但如果你深入研究 Aena，就会发现它是另一回事。它有一部分受监管，但更大的一部分——可能占其价值的 70% 甚至更多——是不受监管的。受监管的业务可能会给你带来类似债券的 7% 的回报，但不受监管的业务会给你带来高得多的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the detail matters. So you might have looked at Heathrow airport and see oh that airport is fully regulated. Airports can't be good. But if you look into the detail of Aena it's a different animal. It has a piece that's regulated and and and a much bigger piece 70% of the value maybe more which is unregulated. Yeah. And so uh maybe the unregulated business the regulated business will give you a bond-like return 7% but the unregulated give you a much higher return.</p>
</details>

你还曾大量投资于证券交易所。以德意志交易所（Deutsche Börse）为例，它有一个名为 Eurex 的衍生品业务，这是一个天然垄断。这是网络效应的进入壁垒，即交易欧洲债券期货的市场流动性。在最流动的市场中获得最佳价格的网络效应，意味着它成为了所谓的“赢家通吃”或天然垄断。一旦你拥有了这种流动性，就很难将人们吸引走。伦敦证券交易所的 LCH Clearnet 清算业务也是如此。所以，当一个交易所能够通过先发优势建立这种天然垄断时，它们可以非常出色。但当然，它们现在已经变了。伦敦证券交易所现在涉足许多不同业务，销售数据，其一半的收益来自数据，而且是转售非专有数据，这使其在那部分业务上存在脆弱性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do do you see now the other group of businesses you've been uh very big in has been the stock exchanges you know you both do stock exchange and so on in the past. Yes. Yes. Why are they why were they so good? In the case of uh Deutsche Borsa starting with that they had a derivative business called Eur which was a natural monopoly. It was a network effect. This was the barrier to entry that liquidity uh of a marketplace um for uh trading bond futures European bond futures. it the the the network effect of getting best prices in in in the most uh liquid market meant it became what it's termed a winner takes all or natural monopoly and once you have that liquidity very hard to move people away price you can never compete on best price and London stock exchange has that for LCH clearet business a clearing business and So where an exchange can CME has it on US uh futures establish this natural monopoly by being the first mover. Okay, the winner takes all. Then the these exchanges can be be very good. But of course they've changed now. London stock exchanges in many different businesses sells data and half their earnings are from data and that's non-proprietary data reselling non-proprietary data. So it has a vulnerability on that piece. They're no longer just what they used to be.</p>
</details>

### 避之不及的“糟糕”行业

你永远不会投资哪些类型的公司或行业？我们有一长串不投资的公司名单，我们称之为“有风险和糟糕的行业”。我过去也投资过其中一些，但我学到了教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the type of companies you would never invest in? Type of industries. Yeah, that's a good question. We have a long list of companies we don't invest in. We're very focused and we call them the risky and bad industries. Uh and that's and I have invested in some of these in the past, but I've learned</p>
</details>

银行。我们不喜欢银行。为什么？因为它们的盈利质量低，杠杆率非常高，比人们想象的要高得多。它们不透明，你无法看透它们。我记得在金融危机前，我研究过瑞士信贷（Credit Suisse），和当时的 CEO 布雷迪·杜根（Brady Dugan）坐下来，把他的资产负债表放在他面前说：“你们有数万亿美元的资产负-债表，我们能逐项过一遍吗？因为我看不懂。”他说：“我也看不懂。”他是个非常诚实的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">banks. Sorry for that. There's a bank. We are not the banks. We hate the central bank. Central bank. Central bank is good. Yes, central banking can be good. But uh we don't like banks. We don't like banks. And why not? Why not? Why not the low quality of earnings? Because they're very leveraged. Um and um uh uh much more than people think, you know, because people look at oh equity to risk weighted assets, but equity to total assets. Many banks have been have run it a hundred times and and so two they're opaque ah you can't look into them you can't yeah you can't uh I remember um prefinancial crisis I had a look at credit Swiss and I sat down with the the then CEO Brady Dugan and and said put his balance sheet in front of him from the the the annual accounts and said you have uh multi- trillion uh dollar balance sheet. Can we walk through the line items cuz I don't understand it. He said I don't either. He was a very honest guy. I really like very yeah very honest and</p>
</details>

不喜欢银行的另一个重要原因是，你迟早会发现某个不那么聪明的人来管理它们，那就会变得有毒。人们追求增长，比如安格鲁爱尔兰银行（Anglo Irish Bank），他们可以通过获取奖金来摧毁股东价值。杠杆、不透明以及利益不一致，这些都是问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay so banks you don't do it. What else do you do? And the other reason for banks is very important. You know that sooner or later you may find someone without a lot of intelligence comes to run them and then it can be toxic. Yeah. People going for growth. AngloIrish bank if you remember that one. Yeah. Of course. And they just uh can destroy the shareholders. Yeah. uh by getting uh bonuses, you know, bare sterns, you know, and non-alignment of interests with leverage and uh opacity and uh and uh</p>
</details>

还有很多其他行业：汽车行业显然是大宗商品；零售业；保险业；大宗商品；大宗商品制造业；烟草业。事实上，大多数制造业都不行。所以，大多数行业都是糟糕的行业。这确实没有留下太大的投资范围。我们认为，大约有 200 家公司可以被认为是高质量且值得投资的。我再列举几个：传统资产管理公司，糟糕的业务；化石燃料公用事业，糟糕的业务；航空公司，糟糕的业务；无线电信，糟糕的业务。我们认为媒体业也很糟糕，广告代理公司也是。这个名单很长。为什么？因为它们面临现有参与者和新技术的激烈竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what are the other others? Oh. Oh. Many the auto industry is obviously a commodity, retail, you know, um insurance, um the um commodities, the uh commodity manufacturing, tobacco, the the truth is uh yeah, anything in in in most things in manufacturing. Okay. So So most industries most industries are bad industries. Yeah. So Chris, it doesn't leave it doesn't leave a big universe. Correct. We say maybe there's 200 companies that we consider to be um high quality and investable. Um and um I mean I'll list you a couple more. Traditional asset managers, bad businesses. Yeah, speaking as one. Um uh fossil fuel utilities, bad businesses. Airlines, bad businesses. Um wireless telecom, bad businesses. We think media is bad. um advertising agencies, you know, it's a very long list. Why? Because it's competitive and with existing players and new technologies.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头的护城河与AI带来的颠覆

我在投资生涯中学到的一个重要教训是，投资者低估了竞争和颠覆的力量，因为他们只看眼前。也许有一家新公司有先发优势，但随后竞争和替代就会出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the one important thing that um I've learned in my time in investing is investors underestimate the forces of competition and disruption because they just look today. Maybe there's a new company which has a first mover advantage but then competition comes in. Yeah. substitution and and uh um</p>
</details>

那么，美国的大型科技公司现在处于什么位置？它们拥有强大的在位优势。以微软为例，我们投资了这家公司。它们的进入壁垒之一是捆绑销售，或者说这创造了客户转换成本。我们都熟悉的 Office 套件包含许多产品：应用程序、文字处理、Excel、电子邮件、安全等等。他们将其作为捆绑包销售，而不是分开销售。当一个新产品或潜在竞争对手出现时，他们可以将其添加到捆绑包中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where does it where does it leave the big US tech companies now? Yeah. So there's a lot of power of incumbency. This is another important point. So let's take a company um Microsoft. Okay. Which we've invested in um and uh one of their barriers to entry is um bundling. Okay. or the or or or maybe because of it's it's it's it it um it creates a customer switching cost. What what do I mean by this? So, the office franchise which we're all familiar with has many um products in it, you know, your your applications, word processing, Excel, your email, um security, different things. And they and they sell it as a bundle. Yep. they don't disagregate it. And when a new um product or a potential competitor enters um they can add it to the bundle.</p>
</details>

比如 Zoom 推出了视频会议，它本有可能将微软所做的所有事情都添加到其产品中。所以微软必须做出回应，他们推出了 Teams，并能够通过捆绑包免费分发给每个人。尽管有些人认为 Zoom 的产品过去或现在都更好，但微软赢得了这场战斗，因为他们拥有我们之前谈到的已安装基础、在位优势和高转换成本。因为一旦人们开始使用他们的 Office 软件，他们就不想更换了。所以人们开始使用 Teams，因为它是免费提供给你的，它足够好，不一定非得是最好的。

<p class="english-text">So Zoom came out with video conferencing and they could have potentially you know added all the things Microsoft does to that. So, Microsoft had to respond and they launched Teams and they were able to distribute it through the bundle. Yeah. free to everybody. And even though Zoom some people believe it was a better product or is a better product, Microsoft won that battle because they had the installed base, the incumbency which we talked about and high switching costs for um because once people are using their their office software, they don't want to switch and so people started using Teams. Okay. something given to you free. Why? Because it was good enough. Yeah. It didn't have to be the best if I if it's free. Yeah.</p>

我们也在 Alphabet 持有头寸，这可能是我们风险最高的投资之一，因此也是我们最小的投资之一。公司显然存在风险，但我们也有一定程度的保护，因为像 YouTube 和他们的云业务这样的业务，加上现金和其他资产，如今已占其市值的一半。所以并非全部依赖搜索，但搜索至关重要。他们能否在创新上超越竞争对手？随着竞争者的进入，搜索业务存在碎片化的风险。这是一个未知数。我们认为他们拥有数据优势，可以提供更高质量的搜索结果，但竞争正在加剧。

<p class="english-text">What about the other tech companies? We have a a position in Alphabet and uh which is um maybe our most risky investment um um where there clearly the company it's just one of our smallest investments as a result. It's it's um and where we have some level of protection because it there are businesses like YouTube and and and their cloud business which represent half the market cap today and the cash and and other things. So um it isn't all search but search is is critical and uh and so can they out innovate um competition? Yeah there's a risk of search fragmenting you know as competitors come in uh and try to but um it's a question mark. Yeah we don't think so. We think they have a lot of advantages of their data to have to uh offer higher quality um search results and um but competition is increasing.</p>

说到这里，你认为人工智能（AI）将如何改变投资格局？它将以我们甚至无法预测的方式加剧颠覆。像呼叫中心这样的行业将会全部破产。另一个领域是印度的外包公司，他们从事编码等工作，对这些服务的需求可能会崩溃，因为 AI 可以用一半的人力完成编码。但 AI 将提高所有公司的生产力并降低其成本基础。所以，如果你拥有一家有进入壁垒的公司，我认为它会变得更有价值。对于竞争激烈的企业，如果你不领先，就可能变得没有竞争力而被颠覆。

<p class="english-text">Talking of which how do you think AI will change the investment landscape here? It's going to increase uh disruption in in in in ways we can't even predict. But there are uh things like call centers un will will all go bankrupt. And uh another segment is Indian outsourcing companies. Yep. Who do coding and and and and uh things like that. um demand for those services could collapse because AI can do coding you know at at w with half the people. Yeah. Mhm. Yep. So, so there are but AI will will increase the productivity and lower the cost base of all all companies and so if you have a company with these barriers to entry it's going to be worth more I think uh for generally competitive businesses if you don't lead you could become uncompetitive and be disrupted. Yeah.</p>

### 估值、长期主义与投资纪律

当我们确定了一家这样的公司，比如 Aena、劳斯莱斯或微软，你如何为它们估值？在你对公司的壁垒足够强大，确信它能长期存在之前，我们甚至不会去看估值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now um we have identified one of these companies let's say I don't know Ayena or Rolls-Royce or Microsoft. How do you value these companies? What what is your valuation tool? Are you we don't even look at that until we get comfortable that the barriers are so strong it will be around now. Okay.</p>
</details>

好的，壁垒很强，我们认为它会长期存在。我们会对相关人士进行背景调查，看看是否遗漏了什么。例如，当我们考虑投资飞机发动机时，我们与一家竞争公司的前 CEO 进行了交谈，他证实了我们的论点，并实际上表示利润率应该高得多。这是尽职调查的一部分。我们会评估管理层，我认为这很重要，但如果你拥有正确的资产，它就不是最关键的。我们还会与竞争对手交谈，了解他们的看法，研究公司的过往记录。通常你无法了解所有事情，而且发现的往往是坏消息。我们会在团队中讨论，希望听到不同的意见。我们团队中有些成员天生就比较悲观，他们很适合用来检验悲观情景。我们总是想知道技术会如何颠覆，竞争会如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So barriers fine we think it will be around. Yeah. We think it'll be around. We think there will continue to be an airport in Madrid. Right. We'll do reference checks on um relevant people. Okay. So, and see if we're missing something. So, we when we were looking at investing in aircraft engines with uh we spoke to the a CEO of a former CEO of one of the the the competitive companies and he confirmed their thesis and and and and actually said the margins should be much much higher. Okay. Okay. And over time they they will go there. So that that's uh one of the pieces of diligence. Um we will assess management where I think it's important but not critical if you have the right assets. Um through ideally through through meeting them um uh the the uh talk to competitors get their view. Um and um um look at competitive companies, look at the track record of the company and usually you don't understand everything and usually the things you find out are are bad things and um I think we'll discuss it with our team and we want to hear competing views. Yeah, we have some members of team are just inherently bearish. Yeah. And they're they're good for testing the bare case. We always want to hear how could technology disrupt. Yeah. And and just what competition and um</p>
</details>

你使用什么样的估值指标？市盈率、现金流、DCF？是的，所有这些都会用到，但不会做成 50 页的电子表格。我们学到的一个非常重要的点是，我们可以通过长期主义获得优势。机构投资者持有一只股票的平均时间不到一年。而我们当前投资组合的平均持有期是八年。这并不是上限，有些我们持有了 13 年，有些新投资比如 GE 航空航天是两年，但加权平均持有期是八年。它可能是 10 年，也可能是 20 年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are you a bearish guy? Um not particularly. No, I I've um Yeah. What but what kind of valuation metrics do you do you look at PS cash flows? Do you do DCFS? So you have like 50 page spreadsheets, all of those, right? All of those, but not 50 pages, you know, that's that's uh uh but a very But really honestly um one of the things we learned is there's a really important point is that we can have an advantage through long- termism. Mhm. Okay. Which is the average stock is held by an institutional investor by under a year or the stock market in the US. How long do you hold it? Average holding period of our port current portfolio is eight years. Eight years. Yeah. That's Yeah. Eight years. I'm not saying that's the limit. It's just uh the we've on average some we've held for 13 years. Some new investments like G aerospace two years but the average weighted average holding period is eight years. Yeah. So but it could be 10, it could be 20.</p>
</details>

你如何将这种长期思维灌输到你的组织中？我们采取一种私募股权的投资方法，即我们必须永远持有这家公司，因为当你需要卖出时，股市的价格可能非常糟糕。我们真正喜欢的一种长期估值方法是**DCF**（Discounted Cash Flow：现金流折现法，一种通过预测未来现金流并将其折现到当前价值来评估投资的方法）。你看得越远，如果你拥有一家伟大的公司，其价值就越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I love long term, right? But how do you install that type of thinking into your organization? I mean we don't straight out of business school out of business school. You want to hey I mean you know went to Harvard like you did or whatever. It's just like hey let's do some stuff. Come on let's do some stuff. Yeah. And it's just like, hey, okay, let's buy something and hold it for 8 years, right? You come home to your partner every day. It's just like they do nothing. Then you we really um you know, if you are in the private equity world, that's normal. Yeah. A private equity fund would hold an investment for their 10-year life funds normally. Yeah. Or longer. 12 years. Yeah. As as you know. And so and so we we it's a it's an overused expression for some or misused. We take a private equity approach i.e. that we have to hold the company forever because you you the stock market maybe at at very uh bad prices when you want to sell. Yeah. if you need to sell and and and so I really think you you need to have that approach and um and so the way we we really like a long-term valuation is DCF the most important things and here's the thing DCF you take the cash flow and you discount it today. Yeah. But here's the thing is is and the the um the longer you can look out if you've got a great company the more valuable value there is.</p>

以我们持有的穆迪公司（Moody's）为例，这是一家评级机构，已经存在了 100 年。在这 100 年里，它的平均收入增长率是多少？10%。这是一个在很长时期内非常不寻常的数字。所以投资者总是低估它的价值，包括我自己。我在金融危机期间以 10 倍市盈率买入，后来在 20 倍市盈率时卖掉了，以为自己很聪明。但它的盈利持续复合增长。我在 150 美元时又买了回来，最近它涨到了 500 美元，现在是 400 美元。这是因为内在价值的复合增长比股价更重要。如果你有一家伟大的公司，它的内在价值就会增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take a company we own Moody's. Moody's a rating a rating agency. So it's been around 100 years. What do you think the average I can ask you a question. Make it fun. What do you think the average revenue growth over that 100 years has been? Uh I'm going to look like a total fool, but uh 100 years is long time. 7%. 10. Wow. Yeah. You know, a very that's a very unusual number over a very long time period. And so investors have always underestimated his value, including myself. Yeah. And um I bought the stock during the financial crisis at 10 times earnings and then and then I even bought shares Warren Buffett was selling a and reduced his stake from 25% to I think he's got 15% and um butcher and uh the are you kind of are you kind of secretly pleased having bought something cheap from Warren Buffett? Yeah, but then I sold it. I doubled I doubled my money. I went from 10 times earnings to 20 and I and I sold it. uh at $100, bought it at 50, sold at 100. I thought I was clever and then but the earnings kept compounding. So you buy back I bought it back at $150. So now it's recently $500, now $400. So it's it's it's because actually the intrinsic value compounding matters more than the stock price. If you have a great company, it will grow intrinsic value. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

从长远来看，估值倍数的重要性不如增长。但大多数投资者不愿意或无法进行长期投资，因为他们要么不知道自己在做什么——这又回到了沃伦·巴菲特被问及风险的定义时所说的：“不知道自己在做什么。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the multiple here's the thing about the multiples. they matter less than the growth when you look at it over a longer period. But most investors are unwilling or unable to invest on a long-term time horizon because either they don't know what they're doing, which interestingly goes uh back to what War they think it's risky, which goes back to what Warren Buffett was when he was asked what the definition of risk was. You know what he said? not knowing what you're doing.</p>
</details>

所以，这里的核心思想是，如果你买了一家真正优秀的公司，你付出的价格在某种程度上并不那么重要，因为它会增长。更准确地说，如果一家公司的内在价值以一个良好的速度增长，而你只看短期，你就会低估它。如果你愿意长期持有并获取内在价值的增长，那么它对你的价值将超过对其他人的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So really good nugget here is that if you buy something which is really good, it doesn't quite matter what you pay for it because it will grow and secondary over a long uh well I say the let's just say it like this the multiple to a point. Yeah. Whether you buy buy it at if it's growing it's all maths. Yep. You've got to look at the growth rate the terminal multiple the all the mult things. But if it's increasing intrinsic value at a at a at a at a good rate, you will undervalue it if you look at it over a short horizon. Yep. I can be saying it like that. And if you're if you're willing to hold it for a long term and extract that intrinsic value growth, it'll be worth to me more to you than other people.</p>

### 公开市场 vs. 私募股权

我听说你曾说过，公开市场上的好公司比私募市场多。是的。因为被卖给私募股权公司的通常不是那么好的公司。我碰巧认为，在一个行业中，大公司更有可能击败小公司。它们有更多的钱用于竞争、研发和规模扩张。我们之前谈到过规模和在位优势是关键。一家发明了新东西的小公司，比如 Zoom，很容易被一家大公司击垮。大公司可以复制。而大公司通常对私募股权来说太大了，他们买不起 Visa。此外，如果一家上市公司向私募股权出售资产，通常不会卖掉他们最好的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've heard you say that there are more good companies in the public market than in the private market. Yes. Why do you say that? because the companies that that um that are sold by to private equity are the ones that aren't as good. Yeah. People Are you sure? I mean, how do you how do you what do you base what you say? Not that I don't Let's dig into it. Let's dig into it. I know it upsets people who are private equity at all. I mean, we actually uh I'm pretty pragmatic about this, but why do you where do you get back? I happen to think that large companies are more likely to beat small companies in an industry. They have more money to compete. Y and um a a and um in R&D. Yep. And scale. We talked earlier about scale being key and incumbency being key um a and switching costs. So um yeah, we we we we think it's an a small company that invents something new. We talked about Zoom. I it it can be crushed by a large company reasonably easily. They can copy and large companies are usually, you know, too big for private equity. private equity can't buy Visa, you know, they they they it's too big for them. Yep. So that that's size excludes private equity from large companies. Um and um and if a public company is selling something to private equity, usually they're not selling their best businesses. Yep.</p>

### “维权投资者”的演变

你什么时候会卖出一家公司？当它的内在价值前景不如其他投资标的时，这不仅包括价值，还包括“信念”（conviction）。我们的投资哲学有两个组成部分：内在价值和信念。价格必须低于或等于内在价值，但第二点，也是许多投资者不关注的，就是信念。你需要始终对你的投资抱有信念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When do you sell a company? When it's a view of intrinsic value is not as good as uh other things including including not just value but conviction. So our philosophy There are two components to it if you like intrinsic value. Yeah. So the price still has to be at or above at or below intrinsic value. But there's a second point which isn't um really um focused on by many investors which is conviction. So you so you lose faith you lose faith in them. No, I'm saying you need to have conviction when you invest in something at all times. Yeah.</p>
</details>

这意味着什么？你可以称之为信心。但你可能会错。我最早的投资之一是一家意大利媒体公司，一家黄页公司。当我最初投资时，互联网还不存在，人们认为黄页是垄断。但最终它归零了。重点是，你可能会错，而在某些行业，你犯错的风险更高，科技就是其中之一。但如果我拥有一家机场或一条不受管制的收费公路，我犯错的可能性就比拥有一家零售商要小，因为我有实体资产支持，替代风险低，投资逻辑更清晰。所以，信念这个概念非常重要。一位投资者曾对我说，他必须能够晚上睡得着觉，投资必须足够显而易见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what does that mean? You could call it confidence. What does that word mean? Because there there's a saying talk is cheap. You can say um the this uh and you can be wrong. Okay. And so my one of my first investments uh when I worked in New York for a hedge fund before starting TCI was in an Italian media company and uh Bane Capital bought control. It was like a billion euro valuation and it went to a 50 billion euro valuation and then went to zero. It was a yellow pages company which say it. Yeah, you remember it. And uh the the and when I first invested the internet didn't exist and uh people thought yellow pages were a monopoly and and and and they were a and so the point is you can be wrong and certain industries your risk of being wrong are higher. M technology is one of those areas. Absolutely. But if I own an airport y that is or a toll road, let's take a toll roads in that are unregulated which there there are there are uh some that we own. I'm less likely to be wrong than if I own a retailer. Yeah. My my chances of being wrong be are are less because I have physical asset backing substitution risk. So um the thesis is much more obvious. Yeah. Because so the um and so this uh this concept of conviction is is very important. One investor Yeah. Yeah. said to me, I have to be able to sleep at night. It has to be so sufficiently obvious.</p>
</details>

你曾被认为是一名**维权投资者**（Activist Investor：通过持有上市公司大量股份来影响公司决策的投资者）。这其实是一个谱系，从强硬地更换董事会和 CEO、要求出售公司，到所谓的“软性维权”，即尝试与公司建立关系和对话。如今，我们与公司的关系通常非常具有建设性。但过去并非总是如此。我学到了一点，那就是硬核的维权并不是一件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on a bit. Uh so you are uh or you were you know perhaps more considered an activist investor. Yes. So what in your in your view what is an activist investor doing? It's it's a spectrum uh and from fullblown hardcore removing boards and CEOs and uh and uh demanding the sale of a company to um um call it uh soft activism, softer activism of trying to have relationship and dialogue with the company at a professional level a a and where you understand their their mindset and their thinking of the business. So so and um uh and engage okay and that could mean many things. It doesn't uh you know uh I'd say today our relationships are very uh generally very constructive with companies. So but it wasn't always that way. Yeah, it wasn't. We I I learned you've gone kind of from having been an aggressive tiger to becoming a bit more of a Yeah. you know big uh lion.</p>
</details>

为什么？因为很难成功。如今的投资者基础大部分是被动投资者，让他们投票支持某件事非常困难。主动管理正在消亡。我刚开始时，指数化投资还很少，所以有一个更积极参与的股东基础。现在指数化限制了股东的权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Though no one thought like that when we started the fund and when we named it the children's investment fund. We thought how are we going to compete with Tiger and Viking and more aggressive named funds. But um yeah it is true. I've learned that actually activism, hardcore activism is not a a a great thing. Uh why not? Yeah, it's very difficult to succeed because the vast proponents of today's investor base are you passive who don't actually uh to get them to vote for something is very difficult and uh um and all the power you know the and and and so active management is dying and so when I started there was very little indexation and so there was a more engaged active share base and now indexation has um limited the power of of of shareholders.</p>
</details>

我过去常常在糟糕的企业里进行维权。比如荷兰银行（ABN AMRO），我们通过股东大会提案迫使其出售，赚了十亿美元。但实际上，这家公司一文不值，却被三家后来都破产的公司以千亿价格收购。所以，他们不知道自己在做什么，我们也不知道。那是一场疯狂。最终，业务本身总是会胜出。在一家糟糕的企业里当维权投资者是毫无意义的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I mean you were one of the most fared people in Europe. Yeah. But I was buying bad businesses uh long ago like ABN AMRO putting up for sale uh through putting on the AGM of Oats to sell the company and we made a lot of money. who made a billion dollars forcing the sale of it. But in truth, the company was worthless, but was bought for hundred billion from three companies who all went bankrupt. Royal Bank of Scotland, Foris, and Onventtor. So, they didn't know what we they were doing. We didn't know what we were doing. And it was all um uh you know, a madness. It was a but it it made money. But for those who sold um but in truth the fundamentals were were were were would trump everything. So a lot of activists end up being activists in in in in bad businesses. Yeah. But are you have you stopped being an activist because you are more attracted to good companies or because you can't take control? The business always wins. Yeah. Okay.</p>

几年前，我们持有的赛峰集团（Safran）宣布要收购 Zodiac 公司。我们认为价格高得离谱，于是发起了一场非常激进的运动，威胁要提起诉讼。最终，赛峰集团将收购价减半并以现金支付。但我们被卖方起诉，索赔一亿欧元。所以，这种事不适合胆小的人。我现在不再喜欢与人争斗了。我们现在的做法是像所有者一样行事。我们感兴趣，我们参与，我们认为我们有权任命董事。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So it's pointless being an activist in a in a B be B business and um that said uh we we we we still engage in it in in in hardcore activism. We we're an investment where we we we went on the board and um you know pushed out you know chairman and some directors and and and and and uh the and and and the company's doing much better now. And um but that's an exception and uh I'd say that was as a result of of of a disastrous case in the company where they we weren't on the board and they they couldn't appoint a CEO. The board was divided and it it it was a real mess. What kind of personal toll does it take on you to be in these fights? Yeah. Let me give you an example. A few years ago, we I don't know it was six years or or so, we own shares in Saffron, uh where we still own them. We've held them for 13 years. And um it's a great company, Aircraft Engines and uh joint venture with G Aerospace. And they announced they were buying a company called Zodiac. And we thought, French aerospace company, we thought the price was ridiculous, 10 billion euros. and they wanted to pay in shares and we thought that we we believe the shares were half price. So they were paying four or five times the the the intrinsic value and we undertook a very aggressive campaign and um threatened the litigation and demanded a vote. And in the in the end the company the target was adding multiple profit warnings and it became clear that we were right and Saffron went to Zodiac and said we have to cut the price in half and pay in cash because TCI are forcing us. Okay. And so and that's what happened. the stocks doubled and um a and but we were sued by the seller for a hundred million euros both me and my general counsel separately. He said Chris I'm not really sleeping much at night. Well, you can afford it. I I I I I can't. And uh so yeah, I went into a Paris court and you it's not for the faint-hearted to do this. And do you enjoy a good argument? No, I don't really enjoy fighting people any anymore. I never really did. It was it was a um it was a something we began with Deutsche Borsa and and now really I'd say what people call activism is a is really an exception to us. So it's like why did we get involved in that zodiac? We were already a shareholder and something bad came out of the blue. It's like you walk home and someone attacks you. Yeah. To try to take your your wallet and you fight back. And I say, "Do you enjoy a fight, Nikolai?" No, but I'm not so sure I would fight back. Should you choose to I would ask you that question is you you you would say, "No, I don't enjoy fighting. It's just I had no choice. I was fighting for my life." Yeah. So, I put it like this. We act as owners. We always act as owners. What does that mean? We we we're interested. We're engaged. We think we have a right to um appoint directors. We're a legal right to it. And and we'll Yeah. And so we teach, one thing we have learned is governance does matter.</p>

### 做空Wirecard：洞察力与独立思考

我们曾**做空**（Shorting：一种投资策略，投资者借入股票并卖出，希望在股价下跌后以更低价格买回以赚取差价）过 Wirecard。我们从中学到，做空不是一个好生意，因为你可能判断正确，但无法承受损失或为亏损提供资金。如果你做空，股价上涨，你的下行风险是无限的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which brings us to kind of the opposite wild card. Mhm. It's a bad company which you shorted. And shorting uh just for those people who don't know it's uh you borrow shares you sell it uh the goal is that the share price should go down and you buy them back cheaper and hand them back right and make a profit. So what's the what was I mean in a in a few words wild card what there is a very long and complicated high level we learned that shorting isn't a great business because you can be right but not be able to hold it or fund the losses. Okay. So, um, but wire card was because if you are short and the shepherd goes up, you basically unlimited downside. Yeah. And you have to fund the losses. This is what people don't realize. You're going to be eventually, right?</p>
</details>

我们研究了 Wirecard 和它所有的会计把戏，然后《金融时报》发表了所有这些文章。我给那位记者打电话，他说：“一切都是真的。”你可以从报纸上直接读到这些信息。但整个德国的权势集团都站出来支持这家公司。这其中有一点模式识别的成分。我在哈佛商学院的会计课上学到过一些危险信号：小审计师、没有现金流、他们在亚洲的办公室是空的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the first guy to short Wire Guard 20 years ago was a guy from Bronte Capital. And the stock went up 20 30 times and went to zero. But he was when that happened, he was interviewed by the media and they said, "Congratulations, you you were right." But he said, "No, I had to covid-19 years ago. I couldn't afford to to to to to fund those losses." And so it's you have to understand investor psychology. Yeah, it's tough. Very tough. And uh I had a dinner once with Warren Buffett and he said he and Charlie looked at shorting. Yeah. They studied it and they just said it was too hard because of that point of understanding investor psychology and the um asymmetric risk and reward and and and and um so it's an exceptional thing but uh we we we we looked at Wire Card and uh and all the accounting games and and then the Financial Times came out with all these articles. Yeah. And I called the journalist, uh, good guy, and I said, "You're writing all this stuff." And, uh, he said, "It's all true." I said, "No one will listen to you." He said, "Everything's true. We stand by every word." And and and you just you could literally read it in the paper. And well, the whole German establishment went in and supported the company. That's right. That's right. In fact, the the the the the chairman was a former CFO of Deutsche Bulser and uh um in in but there was a bit of pattern recognition where I remember uh at Harvard Business School an accounting course I took and there were red flags. Yeah. When you do this small auditor. Yeah. Um uh no cash flow. Yeah. Um and uh things like all their Asian businesses the office was empty. Yeah. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

我认为，要成为一个好的投资者，你需要有某种思想上的独立性。欺诈就摆在眼前。我派了两个团队成员去见 CEO，他们回来后对那些可怜的技术演示感到难以置信。我认为人们过于相信权威了。他们相信德国的权势集团，相信董事会里都是些大人物，却不愿意相信记者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So but I think to be a good investor you need a certain independence of thought. Totally. And probably to be a good journalist as well. And and that's why um the funny thing is that the fraud was there in plain sight. And I think um I learned to be an independent investor and uh the and so we went to see the CEO. Actually, I sent two of my team to meet him and uh and they came back incredulous at this like pathetic demonstrations of technology and uh that they were shown. And interestingly there there was a a potential catalyst which was the the the the the report about their accounting and uh in the end they just said it's it's garbage and uh and then the stock went up a lot and uh so actually I tried to take um uh become an activist in this position. and I filed a a a a a a formal criminal complaint for fraud in in in the uh at the Munich prosecutor's office because uh they said if I didn't wasn't public about it would be viewed as market manipulation. So we're transparent about it and um that created chaos but it forced some actions. Yeah. you you you know when it falls eventually an investigation and uh and so um because I didn't want to be like Bronty Capital where it just ran and ran and so at some point it really became obvious and it became a confidence game. I think that um people trust authority too much. Okay, that sounds a strange thing, but they trusted the German establishment. Yeah. That you had a a board with the the great and the good and and and and they weren't willing to believe the the the the journalist.</p>

### 优秀投资者的特质：从基本面到直觉

是什么让你成为一个好的投资者？我认为谦逊很重要。我总是愿意关注公司的基本面，而不是试图猜测股市走向、宏观经济或交易。我始终是基本面投资者。大多数投资者不是，他们积极交易，关注数据点，寻找催化剂，却不真正了解公司是做什么的。所以，基本面方法是关键，长期主义是关键，集中投资也是关键。我们只持有少数几只股票，比如 10 到 15 只，而不是 100 只。

<p class="english-text">Let's move on to from uh companies to investors. Uh and in terms of what makes a good investor, why are you a good investor? Well, I it's your words. Um it's important to have humility. Um but um there was uh someone I knew who took me aside once and he said, "Chris, you and I, he he did reasonably well." He said, "We weren't the best investors. we just took the most risk. So I just uh which is which is not true actually. Yeah, it was he was uh it was an interesting comment that makes you sometimes when people say a joke you or something you you wonder is it true? But uh um I was always willing to look at the company fundamentals and not the try to guess the stock market. Okay. and um and and focus on macro or trading. Yeah. So I was always fundamental. Most investors are not fundamental. They trade actively. They look at data points. They say what's the catalyst. They don't really know what the the company does. So I think the fundamental approach has been key. Long-termism is key. Okay. Uh um uh another thing we've done is concentration. We've owned a few things. Yeah. We may have 10% type holdings, 10 10 stocks, you know, 15 stocks. We don't own a 100 things.</p>

另一个关键点是直觉。我们凭直觉工作，这让一些人觉得奇怪。直觉被定义为“不经思考的思考”。很多人不理解什么是直觉，它在某种程度上是智力的对立面，是模式识别，是你以前见过的情景。当然，我们也会做分析，但直觉是一种比纯粹智力更高层次的智能。它关乎一切：一个人是否值得信赖，情境，模式。

<p class="english-text">And I think another key point is intuition. We work with intuition, which is something that is uh people find strange. How do you use intuition? It's uh it's been defined as thinking without thinking which is um the Buddhists would call a coan something that just doesn't make sense. We will come back to your Buddhist thoughts later on but it's a lot of people don't understand what intuition is. It's it's it's sort of uh well opposite I have I happen to have written my master's dissertation on this exact topic but so you're you're one who does then it's sort of the opposite of intellect and uh so well pattern recognition in a way you've seen it before. Yeah that's there's a word for it knowing. Okay it's it's it's all the opposite of intellect. Of course, we'll do analysis, but but then um it's a higher level of intelligence than just intellect. But do you what do you have intuition about? Do you have the intuition about the people, the situation? What is it? All of it. Okay. All of it. Is someone trustworthy or not trustworthy? And uh the the the patterns patterns are another thing.</p>

成为一名优秀的投资者是可以训练的。其中有判断的成分，但我认为绝对可以训练。一位精神导师曾说过一句话，也适用于投资：“重要的事情很少，而大多数事情根本不重要。”在投资中也是如此，你需要摆脱噪音，只关注少数几件重要的事情。

<p class="english-text">Is it talent or can it be trained to become a good investor? I think it can be trained. Yeah. There's a judgment element of it. I think it can be trained um for for for sure. No, we have we both have taken inspiration from some of the same people, right? One of them is John who I worked with. Yes. I love John. I love John. He's I consider him a friend. Yeah. When I was just starting out, he he really uh he's a great investor and he took me under his wing a little bit and uh cuz I didn't know anything and uh we we had the same couple of same stocks. The energy group was one and I I I I I I didn't have the experience to know. and say you you would probably say you know that knowing and intuition comes with experience to to but um yeah and uh so yeah I'm I'm a fan of John's. Yeah because most of the things I know about investments I learned from him and his partner Bill Bullinger. So we have some of the we have some of the same teachers here. uh</p>

### TCI的企业文化与慈善事业的根源

TCI 的企业文化是怎样的？我们的投资团队很小，只有七八个人。我们希望保持小规模，氛围是学院式的。我们彼此认识很久，建立了一种无形的信任。为什么不雇佣一百个基金经理？因为我最优秀的人才不会留下来，那会变得太没有人情味。工作的最好的人不是为了钱，他们来是因为喜欢这里的环境。所以我们如何对待员工，每个人如何对待彼此，都非常重要。

<p class="english-text">moving on to corporate culture at TCI. What is a corporate culture like in TCI? How many people are you? You know in the investment team it it's it's it's you know seven eight people. We have a large back office but um how do you work together? The we want small very small and uh it's collegiate. Yeah. We've known each other a long time and there's something that we've built which is an intangible trust. Why don't you have a hundred fund managers? Good question. Firstly, my best people, you know, they would never stay. They just they don't want to um it would be too impersonal. There's a human aspect to work. Yeah. People don't come to work, you know, the best people for money. they come to because they they they enjoy the environment. And so it's really important how we treat people, how everyone treats each other.</p>

你招聘时看重什么？我们会要求应聘者做一个案例研究，很快就能看出你是否懂行，是否认同我们的理念。但仅仅成为一个好的投资者是不够的，你还必须愿意在团队中工作，并且能够与人相处，对自己的错误持开放态度，不能太教条。所以，个性非常重要。

<p class="english-text">And I'll never hire someone without the the the the the blessing of my my my senior team. Um and because we we we could destroy the the culture. And so I mean ice hockey teams are five and football teams are 11. And is there something magic with seven? No, but it's small enough. Yeah, it would above 10 it would be too too big. What do you look for when you hire? So now I'm I'm applying for a job. Everybody you meet everybody. I'm applying for a job at TCI. I'm here. You share the philosophy. You share the philosophy. What kind of questions you ask me? Yeah. What makes a good business? All the things you talked about it. It becomes Yeah. We we we ask for a case study, right, or two. And it becomes immediately obvious whether you know what you're doing. Yeah. Whether you share the philosophy, but also it's not enough just to be a good investor or you have to want to work in a team. Yeah. Not everybody wants that. And you have to be able to get on with with people in in in a way where you have to be open-minded to being wrong. You can't be too dog dogmatic because um so the personality does matter a lot.</p>

公司利润的很大一部分会进入慈善基金会。实际上，我把钱捐给慈善机构，很多慈善事业是我直接做的，有时也捐给基金会或与他们共同投资。我把我赚的所有钱都捐出去了，除了能帮助别人，我并不在乎钱。

<p class="english-text">Now uh you have a big share of the profit of the firm goes to the charitable foundation right? Yes. How well actually I I give it to charities. A lot of philanthropy I do directly often I give it to the foundation um uh or co-invest with them. So yeah one way or another it goes to charity. Do you think it's important for your colleagues that you guys fund all this well charitable? No, I think they make a lot of money too. Or do you think it's irritating that you give away all the money? They they they they also earn uh you know good money and uh it's probably a positive thing. I I I I I I don't know definitively. I um and um the um and um the but I can't you'd have to ask them. Uh I I can't say definitively. Um but I um I I I I I yeah I I give away everything I earn. I I don't really care about money for uh because other than its value in helping people.</p>

我最终明白，驱动我做慈善的是一种灵魂的冲动。我们真正的本质不是个性或肉体，而是灵魂或意识。而灵魂的根本属性是服务，是帮助人类的渴望。它与生俱来，存在于每个人心中。但人们之所以不这么做，是因为他们认同自己的个性，而个性的基本冲动是欲望、财产、权力和金钱。迟早，人们会意识到这些并不能带来真正的目标和意义。对我来说，除了服务，我找不到人生的任何目标或意义。

<p class="english-text">When did when did you learn about philanthropy? Who taught you? When I was in New York working for a hedge fund uh one point after about three or four years it made I don't know two or three million. and they I had done well and they said, "You're going to get a $10 million bonus." And I just, this is in intuition, said, "I don't want it. I I want to just give it to charity." And I created a a US foundation and gave it to it. Um, and I didn't really understand it what was driving me for 50 years. I would uh meet with Bill Gates, did a lot of charitable work with him over the years and he would ask me and I I I couldn't answer the question and uh eventually I did understand it and uh better late than never as a as a soul urge that there's essence who we really are what we really are isn't the personality or the physical body but you know soul or consciousness and and that um some would call it life. Yep. That's something that gives us life and uh that um and will. Yep. Gave you, you know, in in the same way you uh Nikolai had a a desire, a will, a will to do something more with your life. Yeah. Than than than than just make money. And uh and that uh and that in the fundamental nature of that uh that that uh uh that's uh the soul is is service desire to help to to to help ultimately humanity and u where did that come from? It's innate within everyone that but the Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Everyone So if it's inate with everyone why why don't more people do it? Because they're um they identify with their personality a and less with the consider that like a unit as a user interface of the soul and uh and the personality's basic uh urge is desire, possessions, glamour like power and money and other things like that. And um and uh sooner or later people realize that that doesn't really um give you know um some would say happiness but actually there's more important things in the world in life than happiness. uh purpose and meaning but not but you say that sooner or later people but I mean people don't I'm not saying in in in in one life they may need you know many lives and that may be a strange thing for you to hear to uh to realize yeah I don't believe this is the only time we we we we we we're um we here and um eventually we'll learn that the the um what we are and can be as a result of some crisis in your life. Yeah. And death, disease or or or um or in my case the third D, divorce. And uh the um and it's then that they look inward and and and and ask well what is their life about? What is there a purpose? Is there a meaning? And for me, I could never find any purpose or meaning in my life except service. And uh and that is clearly uh you know something you could say it comes from within. Yep. And uh and so that's my origins of my my philanthropy.</p>

### 慈善事业的重点：气候变化与儿童健康

我的基金会现在是世界上最大的基金会之一，拥有约 65 亿美元。我们每年捐赠超过 5 亿美元。主要有两个领域：气候变化，以及非洲和印度的儿童健康。在健康方面，我们关注基础性问题，如避孕、严重急性营养不良和被忽视的热带病。用很少的钱，比如 10 美元、40 美元、50 美元，你就可以拯救一条生命或阻止某人失明。

<p class="english-text">Tell me about the foundation. What are the main priorities of the foundation? Now first you said so it is now one of the largest foundations in the world. Right. We have uh about $6.5 billion dollars and uh in the foundation and uh I also do philanthropy outside of that and so between us we're giving away over $500 million a year. two main areas, climate change and uh children's health in Africa and India. On the um health side, we focus on foundational issues. Um uh contraception is one. You know, we can't get development or lifting people out of poverty if the the women are having which far more children than they want. you know in Africa fertility is nearly seven and in many cases that's not applicable they they they they don't have access um a and agency women don't have access or agency to to to to contraception and so for $10 cost for a voided uh a pregnancy you can help a poor woman have one less pregnancy if she wants. Yep. And that's a remarkably low return on invest high return on investment. Yeah. There's almost nothing. Um another area is um severe acute malnutrition. Um where um I I I I funded the creation of a a company and I and I buy product for um um for $40 a case you can of therapeutic food. Think of it as a fortified uh uh power uh bar or it's it's uh you can save a child's life and there's 100 million children with severe or acute malnutrition nearly half of all child deaths under under five. Um neglected tropical diseases like traoma. I fund traoma surgeries where just a it's not for $50 you can um do fund a surgery which stops someone going blind irreversibly. Yeah. And there's you know millions of people with with this. So with so little money Yeah. $10, $40, $50, you you can save a life. Yeah. Or or or or stop something going blind. It it it's remarkably you know you know what what you know when you go to go out for dinner you might pay $40 for a bottle of wine you wouldn't think oh I could save someone's life with this but that's the reality and so um the um um HIV AIDS um we're very involved in as Well, uh</p>

在气候方面，我们一直致力于为气候运动创建基础设施，倡导监管，因为如果没有监管，任何问题都无法解决。我们资助环境诉讼，所以从某种意义上说，那里也有维权行动。

<p class="english-text">so um uh and on the climate side, what are the main areas that we've been trying to create infrastructure for the climate movement um and uh uh reg regulation advocacy because nothing's going to be fixed if there isn't regulation. um we fund um uh then that's across the board and that's and also technical assistance to governments who want to change but don't know how we're very active in Asia where where if you don't operate in in in India and China you that's where and and and and you know Vietnam and all these countries that's where all the emissions are growing tax is another thing because if if we're not advantaging through tax uh new technologies and and and and we're subsidizing fossil fuels, which is what happens. We'll never change. Um um a and uh methane is another one. We're a fun of the methane hub and methane satellites and just many things uh litigation, environmental litigation. We fund that. So, in a sense, there's activism there.</p>

你如何看待金融市场中对**ESG**（Environmental, Social, and Governance：环境、社会和公司治理，一种关注企业可持续性和社会影响的投资方法）的抵制？我从未真正参与过 S（社会）和 G（治理），只关注 E（环境）。我认为现在正在发生一件非常黑暗的事情，有些人实际上在说：“只要我们今天能赚钱，就烧掉这个星球吧。”我们不关心子孙后代，不关心贫穷国家的人民死去，我们只关心自己的国家和今天能赚多少钱。这其实回到了我所说的灵魂与个性之间的区别，这是一个意识问题。如果我们不改变意识水平，我们就永远无法解决气候、贫困或战争等任何问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And um so given all this, how do you read the backlash against ESG in financial markets? Well, I never really got involved in in in in the S and the G. I just the E. And so here I I I I think is a very dark uh um thing that's going on where people are saying some people are saying in in effect burn down the planet as long as we can make money today and uh we don't care about future generations. We don't care about poor people in poor countries dying off. We only care about our country. Yep. And and making money as much money as we can today to hell with the consequences. And it's really back to what I was talking about this distinction between soul and personality that if um it's a consciousness problem and uh and actually we'll never solve any of these problems whether it's climate or poverty or war if there isn't a change in the level of consciousness.</p>

### 对年轻人的精神建议

你对年轻人有什么建议？走上一条精神之路。我想说，精神世界是真实的。灵魂是真实存在的。有很多途径可以与之连接，你可以有意识地与之连接。无论你走的是长路还是短路，是易路还是难路，通过苦难，你最终会认识到，精神世界不仅是真实的，而且是全部。那是真正目标、意义和喜悦的唯一来源，而这正是世界所需要的。如果你解决了这个问题，其他一切都会变得容易。

<p class="english-text">So given that and in order to finish off on a slightly more uplifting note um What is your what is your advice to young people on a kind of spiritual Yeah. Go on a spiritual um path. Go on a study a and I would say the spiritual world is real. soul is uh when I first mentioned this to my son I think he was uh 20 he said dad the soul is a myth he doesn't think that now is it not he doesn't think that now it's definitely not and there are many paths to connect to it and uh you can connect consciously to it and um and uh whether you go the long way the short way the easy way the the hard way through suffering you eventually come to to to to learn that it the spiritual world is not just real but it's the the whole thing and and so the um and that's the only source of real purpose and meaning and and and and joy which the world needs. Yep. And and and I think that uh um if you crack that then everything else is easy.</p>
