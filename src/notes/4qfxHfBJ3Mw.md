### 引言：揭开“读心术”的神秘面纱

**Oz Pearlman:** 我花了三十年时间逆向工程人类思维，向你展示如何利用它来了解别人在见到你时在想什么，或者判断某人是在说真话还是在撒谎。我们来做点有趣的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've spent three decades reverse engineering the human mind to show you how you can use it to know what somebody's thinking when they meet you or if somebody was telling you the truth or lying. So, let's do something fun.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 想象一下，你面前有一副无形的扑克牌。把它们在你面前摊开。我希望你伸出手，想象自己随机抓起一张牌。现在，看着它，再看着我。好的，闭上眼睛，请伸出你的手。在你睁开眼睛告诉我们那张牌是什么之前……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Imagine that in front of you was an invisible deck of cards. Spread them out in front of you. And I want you to reach down and imagine you just grab a card at random. Now, look at it. Look at me. Okay, close your eyes. Hold your hand out, please. Now, before you open your eyes and tell us what was that card,</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** 方块三。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> three of diamonds.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 睁开你的眼睛，看一看。这不是魔术，我也无法教会你这个。但这些秘密，这些习惯，它们贯穿于生活的方方面面。相信我，你不会想错过接下来的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> open your eyes. Take a look. And it's not magic. I can't teach you this. And these secrets, these habits, they're applicable all throughout life. Trust me, you don't want to miss the rest of this.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** Oz Pearlman 离开了华尔街，成为世界顶尖的**读心术师**（Mentalist: 一种表演艺术，表演者利用敏锐的观察力、心理学技巧和误导等方法，营造出能够读取他人思想或进行超自然预测的假象），解锁了我们解读他人、赢得信任、识破谎言和影响任何人的所需技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> O Pearlman walked away from Wall Street to become the world's leading mentalist, unlocking the skills we need to read people, win trust, spot a liar, and influence anyone.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我的全部工作就是让你相信我能读懂你的思想。但说实话，那是不可能的。我是通过微小的细节来解读人的。例如，我们几千年来的本能是，如果我用双眼直视你，会产生恐惧感；而如果我稍微侧身，用一只眼睛接近你，一只眼睛带来的危险感就小得多。所以，一切都在于最细微的差别。比如，想一个人，想他/她的名字。我猜到了，是五个字母，对吗？告诉大家他/她的名字是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> My whole job is to make you believe that I can read minds. But here is the honest truth. That's impossible. But I read people through small, minute details. For example, we're hardwired from thousands of years that if I approach you directly with two eyes, it can create fear versus if I turn ever so slightly and approach you with one eye. That one eye is less danger. So, it's all about the smallest little nuances. Like, think of someone, think of their first name. I got it. Five letters, isn't it? Tell us all what is their first name.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** Jules。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Jules.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 当你向老板要求加薪，或者约某人出去约会时，这会是一个巨大的战术优势。我会向你解释该怎么做，以及如何养成习惯，消除对拒绝的恐惧，还有获得自信的捷径。接下来是关于如何提高记忆力，这是成功的巨大秘诀。我有一个技巧，我重新利用了洗发水瓶上的说明。而第一步，正是我们 95% 的人都会做错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is a huge tactical advantage when you ask your boss for a raise or when you ask someone out on a date. And I'll explain to you what to do as well as how you form habits, eliminating that fear of rejection, and also the fast track for confidence. But the next thing is how to improve your memory, which is a huge secret to success. And I have a tip. I've repurposed the instructions on a shampoo bottle. And the first step is what 95% of us do wrong.</p>
</details>

### “读人”而非“读心”：核心理念

**Steven Bartlett:** Oz Pearlman，你是个显然能读懂别人心思的人。事实上，你刚写的书就叫《读懂你的思想：世界最伟大读心术师的成功习惯》。对于那些不熟悉你工作的人，你为什么把书命名为《读懂你的思想》？你能读懂我的思想吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">O Pman, you're a guy who can apparently read people's minds. In fact, the book you've just written is called Read Your Mind: Proven Habits for Success from the World's Greatest Mentalist. So, for anyone that isn't familiar with your work and what you do, why did you name your book Read Your Mind? And can you read my mind?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 这就是症结所在。我的全部工作就是让你相信我能读懂思想。但说实话，我并不能。我希望我能，但那是不可能的。我解读的是人，这是一项非常不同的技能。我所做的是建立在魔术世界的基础之上：误导、影响、暗示。了解人们的思维方式，能向我揭示他们在想什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, therein lies the dilemma. My whole job is to make you believe that I can read minds. But here is the honest truth. I can't read minds. I wish I could read minds. That's impossible. I read people. Very different skill. This is built on the world of magic. What I do. Misdirection, influence, suggestion. Knowing how people think indicates to me what they think. Right?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我花了三十年时间逆向工程人类思维。我教给你的是成功的习惯，因为我有效解读他人、走进房间掌控局势、影响他们的技能，所有这些围绕着娱乐表演的技巧，都适用于每一个人。如果你能运用这些秘密和习惯，它们将引导你在个人生活、职业生涯和人际关系中取得成功。我想，如果我运用同样的方法，而不是成为一个读心术师，我在任何领域都能成功。这些技巧在生活中无处不在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've spent three decades reverse engineering the human mind. I'm teaching you habits for success because the skills that I have at reading people effectively, walking into a room, taking charge, influencing them. All of the things surrounding the entertainment portion are things that apply to everyone. If you can use these secrets, these habits, they're going to lead you to success in your personal life, in your professional life, in your relationships. And that's what I've done. I think that if I had done this same playbook and not been a mentalist, I'd be successful at any field. They're applicable all throughout life.</p>
</details>

### 第一印象的心理战术

**Steven Bartlett:** 你认为普通人不知道而你知道的关于人性的东西是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is it that you think you know that the average person doesn't know about the human condition?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我知道人们是如何思考的。我认为我在某个阶段学到的，是人生成功的技能。让我解释一下，对拒绝的恐惧，我认为是失败与成功之间的头号因素。大多数人不去尝试实现目标，是因为他们害怕失败会发生什么，或者他们为自己设定了失败而非成功的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I know how people think. So, I think what I learned at a certain point were skills that are for success in life. Let me explain to you. The fear of rejection is something that I think is the number one factor between failure and success is the fear. Most people don't try to achieve their goals because they're fearful of what will happen if they fail or they set themselves up for failure instead of for success.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我 14 岁时，会走进一家餐厅，说服他们给我一份表演的工作，因为我从 13 岁就开始玩魔术了。我通过不断迭代来学习：当我走近人们时，什么让他们感到舒适，什么让他们感到不自在。我开始学习人们的思维方式，这涉及到最微小的细节。我学到，如果我直接走向你，就像动物看到两只眼睛会害怕一样；但如果我稍微侧身，从一个角度接近你的桌子，你只看到一只眼睛。我们经过成千上万年躲避捕食者的进化，已经形成了本能：一只眼睛意味着更少的危险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do I mean by that? When I was 14, I'd walk up to a restaurant. I talked my way into getting a restaurant gig because I've been doing magic trick tricks since I was 13. And I started learning by iterating what makes people when I walk up to them comfortable with me, what makes them uncomfortable. I started learning how people think. And it's down to the smallest little nuances. I learned that if I approach you directly, the same way that animals fear you when they see two eyes versus if I turn ever so slightly and approach your table at an angle, you only see one eye. We're hardwired from thousands and thousands of years of avoiding predators. That one eye is less danger.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我走上前，会设定时间限制。我很快就发现，当我走过去时，别人首先想到的是：“天啊，他会在这里待很久吗？” 接着是：“他们知道这孩子在这里工作吗？他行不行啊？天啊，我需要钱，我得给他小费吗？我没带现金。” 所有这些在你脑海中闪过的念头，被称为**启发法**（Heuristics: 人们在做决策时依赖的心理捷径或经验法则）。如果你能知道别人在想什么——不是为了表演读心术，而是在他们见到你时，在你向老板要求加薪时，或者在你约男/女孩出去约会时——了解这些会给你带来巨大的战术优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I walk up to you, I create time limits. I learned quickly that if I walk up, the first thing someone thinks is, "Oh my god, is he going to be here long?" The next thing is, "Do they even know this kid's working here? Is he any good at this? Oh god, I need money. Do I have to tip him? I didn't bring cash. All of these thoughts that go through your minds. They're known as heruristics. It's how we deal with our life every day. And if you can know what somebody's thinking, not to perform a mentalist trick, but know what they're thinking when they meet you or when you ask your boss for a raise or when you ask a girl or a guy out on a date, you knowing that is a huge tactical advantage.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** 具体来说，你会怎么做？你会说什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And specifically, how would you do that? What would you say?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 作为一个读心术师，我做得最多的就是准备。我提前为可能成功、可能失败以及其间所有可能出现的问题做好准备，从 A 计划一直到 Z 计划。在那种情况下，我侧着身走过去，这样他们就知道我可能很快就会离开。我一只脚在里，一只脚在外。然后我会对你说：“你听说今晚有什么活动吗？这是你的幸运日。” 这立刻就不同了，这会带来一次**多巴胺冲击**（Dopamine hit: 指大脑中多巴胺神经递质的突然释放，通常与愉悦感和奖励机制相关），就像你的手机振动时一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I would say is in my mind as a mentalist, what I do most is prepare. I prepare in advance for what will work, what won't work, and all the troubleshoots in between. Plan A, B, C, D, all the way to Z. So in that situation, I walk at an angle so they know I might be leaving soon. I'm one foot in, I'm one foot out. I would then say to you, did you hear what's going on tonight? It's your lucky day. Right away, that's a different thing. That's a dopamine hit. That's the same way when your phone buzzes.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我向你提出的问题暗示着积极的能量，而且不是“是”或“否”的回答。你没有办法阻止我。如果我说：“嘿，想看我变魔术吗？” “不，走开。” 砰，我们就结束了。向人们提出开放式、本质上积极的问题，几乎总能得到很好的回应。“你听说为什么今晚是你的幸运之夜了吗？” “哦，为什么是我的幸运之夜？” 我会说：“老板请我来，作为特别款待，为你表演一些精彩的东西。” 现在听好了：“老板”，他们就知道我在这里工作；“请我来”，说明我认识老板，这是一种社交价值；“作为特别款待”，意味着你不需要付钱；“精彩的东西”，我没有给你任何说“不”的理由。我希望在不到 10 秒的时间里完成这一切。这就是开场白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By me saying to you a question that denotes positive energy without a yes or no. You don't have a way to stop me. If I said, "Hey, do you want to see me do magic?" No. Get out of here. Boom. We're done. Asking people questions that are open-ended, that are inherently positive, almost always generates a great response. Did you hear why it's your lucky night? Oh, why is it my lucky night? And I say, "The owner brought me in as a special treat to do something amazing for you." So now listen to this. The owner, they know I'm working there. The owner brought me in. I know the owner. Social value, social currency, as a special treat. That means you don't need to pay me money. They've paid the bill. Amazing. And then to show you something amazing. So I've given you no point at which to say no. I've given you very few angles to think anything but positive. And I've done this all in hopefully less than 10 seconds. That's the intro.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** 我从中学到的是，你创造了一个积极的好奇心缺口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what I what I heard there was you you created this like positive curiosity gap.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 是的，就像 Mr. Beast 在他视频开头做的那样，瞬间抓住你的注意力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. the hook instantly.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** 是的，一个积极的好奇心缺口，让你迫切地想知道答案。你说：“他们请我来的。你听说今晚发生什么了吗？太棒了。他们请我来作为款待，做一些精彩的事情。” 我立刻就需要知道这是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I hate it's like a positive curiosity gap where you you need that gap closed. And you said in that case, they brought me in. Have you heard what's happening tonight? It's amazing. You've brought me in as a treat to do something amazing. Immediately I need to know what this is.</p>
</details>

### 如何识别谎言：建立行为基准

**Oz Pearlman:** 对很多人来说，他们想知道一个核心问题：某人是否感兴趣？是或否？某人是否在说谎？是或否？如果你能知道这两件事，我认为会开启一个充满可能性的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a lot of people, they want to know a core thing. Is someone interested? Yes or no? And is someone lying? Yes or no? If you could know those two things, I think that opens up a world of possibilities.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 学习判断某人是否对你说谎的最好方法是了解他们的基准。让我解释一下这是什么意思。只见过某人一次，很难了解他们。一次性交易，你无法真正衡量他们是什么样的人。但你生活中只见过一次的人有多少？很少。你遇到的大多数人都会经常见面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The best way to learn if somebody's lying to you is learning their benchmarks. Let me explain to you what that means. Meeting somebody one time, it's very hard to know things about them. One-time transactions, you can't really gauge who they are as a person. But how many people in your life do you meet once? Few most of the people you meet you meet often.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 测谎仪的工作方式是，他们必须事先问你一些问题来设定你的基准。他们会检查并观察，让你说一个诚实的答案。“你的名字是 Steven Bartlett 吗？” “是。” 他们观察你的各项指标，看看诚实是什么样子的。然后他们会让你说一个谎言，并试图比较两者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a lie detector machine, the way they work is they have to ask you questions beforehand to set your your your benchmarks. They have to check and they see tell me an honest answer. Is your name Steven Bartlett? Yes. They look at your indicators to see what honesty looks like. And then they look to see tell me a lie. And now they try to compare the two to each other.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 所以，当我观察人们时，我试图看他们说真话时是什么样子。你可以在家试试这些有趣的事情。当某人给你讲故事时，看看他们插入了多少细节？他们的语速是怎样的？如果你经常观察他们，你通常能分辨出他们是否在说谎。他们会添加更多细节吗？你可以尝试找一些善意的谎言，看看他们说谎时和说真话时有什么不同，然后开始更相信你的直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what I do when I watch people and observe is I try to see what do they look like when they're telling me the truth. And these are fun things you could try at home. See when somebody tells you a story, how many details do they insert? What's their cadence, right? How do they speak? You can tell when people are lying more often than not if you observe them often. You can see it. Do they add more details? So you can try to find fun ways that seem to be white lies to see what do they do when they lie versus what do they do when they tell the truth and then start to trust your instincts more.</p>
</details>

### 销售与说服的秘诀：永远关注对方

**Steven Bartlett:** 假设我正在向你推销东西。我是一家营销机构的老板，我想让你购买我的营销活动。你能告诉我一些我应该考虑或做的事情，来让你购买我想要你买的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Say I was trying to sell you something. I'm a marketing agency owner and I would like you to buy this marketing campaign from me um instead of this one or no campaign. Sure. So, what are some things you could tell me that I should be thinking about or doing if I'm selling to you to make you buy what I would like you to buy?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 第一条规则，我称之为“引导你内心的读心术师”：重点不在于你，而永远在于他们。这是我成功的首要秘诀。我不应该能上各种不同的电视网络表演。我在 CNBC（美国全国广播公司财经频道）上过几十次，那是个财经频道。有多少其他魔术师或读心术师上过那个频道？零。这不合逻辑。那是个严肃的频道，他们做金融。他们为什么请我上节目？因为我根据观众的需求量身定制我的表演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Number one rule, I call this channeling your inner mentalist. It's not about you. It's always about them. That's been the number one secret to my success. I shouldn't have been I've been on all different networks doing what I do on CNBC. I've been on there dozens of times. That's the financial network. How many other magicians or mentalists have ever been on that network? zero. It doesn't make sense. That's a serious network. They do finance. Why are they bringing me on? Because I tailor my presentations to the viewer.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我不考虑自己。一个扑克牌戏法是关于我的。而我做一些与股票、债券、股息和利率相关的事情，则能吸引正在观看的人。同样，如果我走进一个有足球运动员的房间，我会把一切都围绕足球来构建。所以我挑战你，当你做那样的演示时，你只是在考虑自己，还是在思考如何突出这个人缺少什么？他们的现状有什么问题？倾听你的消费者，倾听你的客户，倾听你的观众。他们会告诉你答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think about myself. A card trick is about me. Me doing something related to stocks and bonds and and dividends and interest rates. That is fascinating the person watching. The same way if I go into a room with football players, I make everything structured on football. So I challenge you that when you make a presentation like that, are you just thinking about you or where can you highlight the attributes of what is this person missing? What's wrong with what their status quo is? What are you missing? Listen to your listen to your consumer. Listen to your client. Listen to your audience. They will tell you. They will give you the answers to what you need to give back to them.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 太多人接触别人时，都是带着这样的心态：“我有多棒？我的产品有多棒？” 一切都是关于我、我、我。这需要转变为以利益为导向的语言。所有的一切都应该是关于“你”。我想让你的生活更轻松。我想让我们平台的迁移过程无缝衔接。你目前有什么困扰？我想知道所有让你产生抗拒的因素。是什么阻碍你说“是”？每当你告诉我一个，我都希望准备好去解决它。你要像读心术师一样，预测他们会说什么。但在这种情况下，你不是在猜牌、数字或名字，你是在猜测是什么想法让他们不买你的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So many people when they approach someone else, they approach with the following. How great am I? How great is my product? Bum bum bum. It's all about me, me, me. This needs to be benefitsoriented language. All of it should be you. I want to make your life easier. I want to make this migration to our platform seamless. What's currently bothering you? I want to know all the things that you that are your moments of resistance. What's resisting you from saying yes? And every time you tell me one, I want to be prepared to check that off. You want to anticipate what they're going to say the same way a mentalist does. But in this case, you're not guessing cards or numbers or names. You're guessing the thoughts of what's keeping them from buying your product.</p>
</details>

### 信息就是力量：记忆的惊人回报

**Steven Bartlett:** 如果我要向你和 Uber 的 CEO 推销，你会写下或思考你正在应对的反驳意见或那个人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> if I was pitching to you and you're the CEO of Uber and I want you to work with my agency. Before I go into that meeting, do you write down or just think about the rebuttals or the person that you're you're contending with and then try and tailor the presentation to a set of sort of ideological ego factors that that that you believe that person's coming into the room with.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我会写下所有东西。书里有一章专门讲记笔记如何改变了我的生活。在每一场表演和与人交往中，我都会写下我所做的一切，我遇到的每一个人，以及我记得的关于他们的事情。我会在表演一结束就立刻做这件事。信息就是力量。人们最关心的是他们自己、他们的家人、朋友和事业。我们每个人都是自己电影里的主角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right? So I write down everything. Literally at one chapter in that book is all about how taking notes has changed my life. So at every show and through every interaction that I ever have with somebody, I will write down everything that I did, everybody that I met, things that I remember about them. And I will do this immediately when I finish the show. information is power. And the number one thing that people care about is themselves, their family, their friends, their career, right? All of us are the star of our own movie.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 如果你能记住关于那个人的事情，不是那种令人毛骨悚然的方式，而是他们告诉你的事情。昨晚我遇到一个人，她有两个孩子，三岁和五岁。她的大儿子特别喜欢某个 YouTube 明星。我知道他们住在哪。她和我分享了很多细节，在她看来这些细节就像 Snapchat 一样，转瞬即逝。但对我来说不是。现在我把这些写下来了，我可能一个月、一年或十年后会再见到她。你知道当别人记得你告诉他们的事情时，那种感觉有多棒吗？就像中了彩票一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, think of it this way. If you can remember things about that person, not creepy. What if they told you something? Last night I met somebody. She has two children. They're three and five. Her oldest son absolutely loves this one YouTube star. They live I know where they live. Like she just shared a lot of details with me that in her mind are kind of like Snapchats. They vanished. They didn't vanish to me. So now that I've written those down, I might see her in a month, in a year, in a decade. Do you know how great that feeling is to somebody when you remember things they told you? It's like winning the lottery.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我没有超常的记忆力。书的另一部分是关于如何提高记忆力，我认为这也是人们没有意识到的生活中成功的巨大秘诀。我见到他时会对他说：“John，我真希望你把那个 6124 的密码改了。” 他会大吃一惊。Steven，你明白吗？那不是一个戏法。我只是把它写下来了。我所做的只是在去之前花时间回顾了一下，让他感觉很特别。你知道他会怎么做吗？他会在未来的岁月里谈论那个时刻。我创造了一个记忆。如果你能为他人创造难忘的时刻，他们会记住你，并向他人传播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't have a supernatural memory. Another part of the book is how to improve your memory, which I think is also a huge secret to success in life that people don't realize. And I say to him, I go, "John, I sure hope you change that pin code from 6124." He is blown away. Stephen, do you understand? That's not a trick. I wrote it down. All I did was take the time to review it before I got there and made him feel special. And do you know what he's going to do? He's going to talk about that moment for years to come. I've created a memory. If you can create memorable moments for others, they will remember you and they will spread the word to others.</p>
</details>

### 快速建立自信的两种心法

**Oz Pearlman:** 另一个巨大的因素就是自信。人们如何建立自信？我 14 岁开始做这个的时候，我是一个极度自信的少年吗？不。我的父母刚离婚，我的生活相当动荡。我认为我做这个是为了逃避所有的创伤和悲伤。自信是随着时间建立起来的。那么，有什么更好的方法来加速这个过程呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Another huge one is just confidence. How do people build confidence? When I was 14 and I started doing this, was I this hyperconfident teenager? No. My folks just got divorced. My life was pretty tumultuous. I think I did this as a way to not have to deal with all of the trauma and kind of sadness. And confidence gets built over time. So, what's a better way to fasttrack that?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 对很多人来说，走进一个房间，要做一个演讲。你是不是紧张得要死？我想大多数人会说是。我脑子里有个小技巧，我会问自己：“明天我对此会有什么感觉？” 如果我能把我的感觉快进到明天会怎么样？现在就试试。听众朋友，有什么你不想做的事？你不想打电话给某人，不想传达坏消息。你现在就去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a lot of people, you walk into a room, you have to give a presentation. Are you nervous as hell? I think most people would say yes. I have this little trick in my mind where what I do is I ask myself, what will I feel like tomorrow about this? What if I could fast forward my feelings to tomorrow? And instead of just, you know, up in the air, try it right now. What's something that you, the listener, don't want to do? You don't want to call someone. You don't want to deliver bad news. You're avoiding it at all costs. Do it now.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 在打电话前，你可能会感到 8 到 10 分的恐惧。第二天闹钟响时，问问自己：“我感觉如何？” 大多数时候你什么都感觉不到，可能只有 2 或 3 分。眼不见，心不烦。那么，如果你能欺骗自己的大脑，就像我欺骗你让你认为你的眼球运动与此有关一样呢？欺骗你自己的大脑，看看你一天后的感觉。你什么都感觉不到。所以，如果你能开始对自己这样做，重新连接你的大脑，对自己说：“一天后我就什么都感觉不到了。管他呢，我现在就做。” 仅仅是这个克服拖延症的技巧，就能建立起巨大的自信。

<p class="english-text">Right when you finish the call, you're going to feel in the dread before you're going to feel an 8 n 10 of dread. The next day when the alarm goes off, ask yourself, "How do I feel?" Most of the time you feel nothing. Two or three. It's out of sight, out of mind. So, what if you could trick your brain the same way I tricked you to think your eye movements have anything to do with it? Trick your own brain to see how you feel a day from now. You feel nothing. So, what if you can just start doing that to yourself? Rewire your brain and say, "I'm going to feel nothing in a day. Screw it. I'm going to do it now." And just that trick of getting over procrastination builds a tremendous amount of confidence.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 另一个方法是，我会在脑海中创造出两个独立的人格。一个是表演者 Oz，魔术师 Oz，现在的读心术师 Oz。另一个是 Oz Pearlman。他们不认识真实的我，那是另一个人。所以当我走到一张桌子前被拒绝或粗鲁地对待时，我不会自己感受到那种痛苦，而是把它推到别处。我会想：“你知道吗？他们不喜欢的是那个表演者。那是另一个人，不是我。” 如果你能在自己的头脑中做到这一点，就像我用我的技巧欺骗你的头脑一样，欺骗你自己的头脑，那将消除那种刺痛感。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Another one is I would walk up to tables and people would kick me out. So what I did is I created in my mind some way where I have two separate personalities. This guy was O's the entertainer, O's the magician, now O's the mentalist. This guy was O's Pearlman. They don't know the real me. That's a different guy. So when I walked up to a table and got turned down or rudely rejected, instead of me feeling that pain in myself, I pushed it somewhere else. And I go, you know what? They didn't like the entertainer. That's a different guy. That's not me. If you can do that in your own mind, the same way that I use my tricks to trick your mind, trick your own mind, that will take away the sting.</p>

### 沟通的关键：成为最感兴趣的人

**Steven Bartlett:** 关于倾听的技巧，你是否有一个系统或框架来成为一个出色的倾听者？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the skill of listening, which I I think is also so important to what you're saying there about being likable and winning people over. Do you have a system or a framework for being a great listener?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 当然。我给 Steven Spielberg 的父亲办过一个 99 岁的生日派对。那是一个相当私密的场合。表演结束后，他走过来感谢我，我准备好了。但我一个问题都没能问 Steven Spielberg。你知道为什么吗？他一直在跟我说话。他不停地向我提问，关于我的生活，关于我的动力。我只想一直说：“暂停一下，我有问题要问你。你是斯皮尔伯格啊。” 他把一切都围绕着我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sure. So, I did a party for Steven Spielberg. Um, it was his father's 99th birthday. It was pretty intimate affair. So, at the end of the show, he comes up to thank me and I'm I'm ready. I was able to ask Steven Spielberg zero questions. Do you know why? He talked to me the whole time. He kept asking me questions rapid fire, this and about my life and about what drove me and this. And I just wanted to keep being like, "Pause. I got questions for you. You're Steen Spielber. He made it all about me. All about me.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 那天我学到，倾听是一种更强大的力量。一个房间里最有趣的人，往往是那个对别人最感兴趣的人。我见过的一些最成功、最真诚的人，他们会看着你的眼睛，锁定你，不会环顾四周看别人。他们会给你 100% 的专注。他们会问你一些别人没问过你的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I learned it that day that that it's a greater power to listen. And that the most interesting person in a room tends to be the most interested person in the room. And that some of the people I've seen that are the most successful, the most authentic and genuine, they will look you in the eye. They will lock in. They will not be looking around at other people. And they will give you their 100% undivided attention. And they will ask you questions that other people haven't asked you before.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我挑战你，不要只问那些常规问题。当你遇到某人时，不要问：“哦，你是做什么的？” 当我们这么做的时候，我们就会进入自动驾驶模式。挑战自己，成为那个例外，想一个能让他们脱离自动驾驶模式的问题，让他们思考：“哇，我以前没真正想过这个问题。” 问一些非“是”或“否”的问题也很棒。问一些能让他们探索自我的问题。我认为这是积极倾听的重要部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I challenge you, don't just do the normal question when you meet somebody. Oh, what do you do for a living? Oh, what? We as soon as we do that, we go into autopilot. challenge yourself to be the outlier and think of a question you can ask someone if you have time to think of it in advance or in the moment that throws them out of autopilot that makes them think, "Wow, I haven't really thought of that before." Asking questions that are not yes or no questions are also great. Ask questions that let them explore who they are. I think that's a big part of active listening.</p>

### 提升记忆力的实用技巧：洗发水法则

**Steven Bartlett:** 你在书里谈到如何提高记忆力。为什么提高记忆力很重要？它如何帮助我与他人建立联系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and in the book in page 166 you talk about improving one's memory. yes. what do I need to know why does it matter to improve my memory and in what way does improving my memory help me to connect with other people</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我们已经到了不需要记忆力的地步。很多人不知道怎么开车去隔壁城市，如果 GPS 失灵了，祝你好运。你记不住任何人的电话号码。我认为记忆力是一种超能力，因为现在没人指望你拥有它了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we've gotten to the point where we don't need our memory right a lot of people don't know how to drive to a place a city next door they literally with if GPS went out good luck right you don't know anyone's phone numbers how many people's phone numbers do you have memorized. I think memory is a superpower because no one expects you to have it anymore.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我有一个适用于特定情况的技巧，我重新利用了洗发水瓶上的说明，这样它就能留在你脑海里。洗发水瓶背面有三个词：揉搓、冲洗、重复（Lather, rinse, repeat）。我把它描述为：倾听、重复、回应（Listen, repeat, reply）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I have a a a trick, a tip for that specific situation, as well as others for memory, but I've repurposed the instructions on a shampoo bottle so it sticks in your head. Shampoo bottles have three words on the back. Lather, rinse, repeat. Right? I will describe it as this. Listen, repeat, reply. Listen, repeat, reply. So easy.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 第一步听起来很傻，但这是我们 95% 的人都会做错的：我们没有真正地倾听。当你听到那个人的名字时，这不是记忆问题，你从一开始就没记住那个名字。因为当你走近他们时，就像电脑一样，很难同时进行读和写。你当时在想别的事情，很可能是在想你要对他们说什么。所以，那一刻，最重要的事情就是真正地倾听，让你的头脑安静下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first step sounds silly. It's comical. Why am I even saying this? The first step is what 95% of us do wrong. We don't actually listen. When you hear that person's name, it's not a memory issue. You never even knew the name to begin with. Because right when you walked up to them, just like a computer, read, write. Very hard to read and write at the same time for our brains. You were thinking of something else. you were thinking of what you were going to say back to them in most instances. So at that moment, the number one thing to do is actually listen, quiet your mind.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 当我走近你时，我会确保我听到了你的名字，因为我会立刻重复两次。“Stephen，是叫 Steve 还是 Steven？” 我想确认一下。我已经说了三次你的名字了，你忘记它的几率大大降低了。最后一步是“回应”，也就是使用以下三种策略之一：你可以学习如何拼写它；如果名字不适合拼写，比如 Jacob，我会评论说：“Jacob，我喜欢那件衬衫。” 我创造了一个视觉挂钩；第三种是，你可以把它和你认识的其他人联系起来。这整个过程在 5 秒钟内完成。你绝对不会在派对剩下的时间里忘记那个人的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right when I walk up to you, I make sure that I've heard your name because I instantly repeat it twice. Stephen, is it Steve or Steven? I want to make sure I've just said your name three times already. Your chance of forgetting it have gone down dramatically. The last one is reply, which is use one of the three following tactics. one, you could learn how to spell it. You have a name that can be spelled. So I go, is it Steven with a V or a PH. If it's not a name like that, if it's, you know, Jacob, you're not going to spell that. I'm going to say to you, I might comment. I go, Jacob, I love that shirt. The V-neck. Jacob, really sharp. So now I've created a visual hook. You're Jacob with the V-neck shirt. Third one is is if you want you can do something that's a connector to someone else you know. That happens in 5 seconds what I just said. You will not forget that person's name for the rest of the party. I promise you.</p>

### 故事的力量：重塑他人的记忆

**Steven Bartlett:** 为什么故事很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> why why a story?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 因为故事会被记住。故事交织在我们的 DNA 中。我们每个人都有一个故事要讲。我认为一个很重要的事情是决定什么让你变得难忘。你越能让别人记住你，人们就越会谈论你，这无论你在生活中做什么都会对你有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because stories are remembered. Stories are interwoven into our DNA. Each of us have a story to tell. I think such a big one is deciding what makes you memorable. The more that you can become memorable to others, the more people talk about you, it benefits you no matter what you do in life.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我十几岁的时候常做一个纸牌戏法，他们把签名的牌放回去，我把整副牌扔向天花板，牌掉下来，但他们签名的那张牌会粘在天花板上。但当他们向别人描述这个过程时，他们会漏掉我扔牌的部分。为什么他们会忘记这么重要的细节？我意识到，我把注意力放在哪里，他们的注意力就放在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a trick I used to do when I was a teenager where I would have somebody pick a card. It was a card trick. They would put the card back in. They would sign it. I would throw it on the ceiling. The deck would fall down, but their signed card stayed stuck on the ceiling. But when they described the procedure back to someone else, they would leave out the part with me throwing the deck. Why did they forget such an important detail? I realized what it was. What I put my attention on, they put their attention on.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我扔牌的时候，有时自己并不抬头看，而是接住掉下来的牌。这个微小的细节意味着，我接住了牌，没人知道发生了什么。我让他们自己抬头发现那张牌，而不是由我来指出来。不知何故，在他们的大脑中，他们删除了我扔牌的那个细节。现在，我创造了一个奇迹。从那时起，这改变了我的思维方式。我对自己说，我做什么不重要，重要的是人们记住了什么，以及他们会向别人讲述什么样的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I when I threw the deck up, sometimes wouldn't look up with it. I would throw the deck up. I wouldn't look and then I'd catch it. Such a small minute detail. But me doing that meant I caught the deck. No one knew what happened. And I let them look up and discover the card themselves rather than me do it. Somehow in that in their brain, they deleted that one detail of me throwing the deck. And now I had a miracle. And that changed my way of thinking from there on out. Which I said to myself, it doesn't matter what I do. It matters what people remember. And what's the story they tell others?</p>
</details>

### 成功的代价与痴迷的力量

**Steven Bartlett:** 你认为痴迷对于达到顶峰有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm I'm wondering how important you think obsession is to get to the very top.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 这是一种恩赐。如果有人能找到一种痴迷，那就是一种恩赐。你已经到达了一个很少有人能到达顶峰的行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's a blessing. It's a blessing. If somebody can find an obsession, you've got to the top of an industry where very few people get to the top of.</p>
</details>

**Steven Bartlett:** 考虑到你成功的特质，对于这个孩子来说，痴迷显然是其中很大一部分，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, thinking about the characteristics of your success, um, for this kid, it was obviously obsession was a huge part of that, right?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 是的。激情。那些让我最兴奋、最敬佩的人，总是充满激情。我不在乎那是什么。即使你是一个清洁工，而你的痴迷是垃圾，一些我从未想过的事情。我遇到过很多人，他们谈论的话题对我来说毫无意义，但一旦我开始和他们交谈，他们的兴奋程度，他们如此投入的感觉，也让我感到投入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. Passion. The people that excite me the most to be around in my life. The people that I look up to and I'm on the edge of my seat always have a passion. I don't care what that's for. I don't care if you are uh you know a trash man and your obsession is is trash. Like something that I would never think about. I've met so many people where they have a topic that meant nothing to me at the moment, but once I start speaking to them, their level of excitement, their their feeling like the fact that they're so invested makes me feel invested.</p>
</details>

### 结语：从激发好奇到采取行动

**Oz Pearlman:** 成功有其陷阱。如果你把自尊建立在别人能给你的东西上，比如名声、金钱，那些无形且可能被夺走的东西，而不是通过内在的动力、与自己竞争、设定自己的目标来定义自我价值，那么它是短暂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think being very busy and success has its pitfalls. If you assign your self-esteem to something others can give you, be it fame, be it money, be it things that are intangible and that can be taken away and you don't define your self worth by something internal like your own drive, competing against yourself, creating your own goals, then it's fleeting.</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我挑战你，现在就给自己设定一个目标。如果你能从这次播客中学到一件事，那就是决定一件你想为之奋斗的事情。定义它。不要做那些不切实际的事情。可实现的目标必须是可量化的。决定它是什么，并让明天成为你追求它的第一天。创造所有能帮助你成功而不是失败的条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I challenge you right now to assign yourself a goal right now. If you get one thing out of this podcast, decide one thing that you want to strive for. Define it. Define it. Don't do these pie in the sky things. Goals that are achievable have to be quantifiable. Be it a number, be it something achievable. Decide what it is and make tomorrow the first day you go after it. And create all of the things that will help you succeed, not fail.</p>

**Steven Bartlett:** 如果你能永生，你会选择吗？为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you could live forever, would you? And why or why not?</p>
</details>

**Oz Pearlman:** 我想我会的。我从小就痴迷于科幻小说。我读过很多关于不朽的书。看到身边的人一个个离去，那种悲伤，然后你会怎么做？因为在某个时刻，你会感到空虚。但同时，死亡是每个人都无法回避的深渊。我想我会愿意永生，但我敢打赌，一旦我真的永生了，它就会开始变成一种诅咒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I would. I think I would. Uh, an obsession of mine growing up has been science fiction. My favorite books to read, the ones that just capture my imagination. And there are so many books I've read about immortality. And just what would it be like to see all the people around you pass away and the sadness and then what would you do? Because at some point, you'd feel empty. But at the same time, death is just that abyss that everyone, no matter how much we avoid thinking about it, talking about it, you're going to die. I think I would love to live forever, but I bet you once I live forever, it would start to be a curse.</p>
