### 市场开盘概览：多重因素交织的一周

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是 10 月 30 日，星期四，上午 8:47。这周真是疯狂，很难相信今天才周四。但昨天无疑是 2025 年股市中最重要的日子之一，我们有很多内容要讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Thursday, October 30th, 8:47 a.m. What a week it has been. It's hard to even believe that it's Thursday given how crazy this week has been, but yesterday was one of the most important days in the stock market for 2025. And we have got a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

我们有科技巨头的财报，包括 Meta、微软和谷歌。这三家公司都极其重要。其中一家表现非常出色，另外两家表现尚可。一家股价在下跌，另一家实际上在上涨，还有一家持平。具体来说，Meta 在下跌，谷歌在上涨，微软持平。我们稍后会详细讨论。昨天美联储降息了，这是一件大事，降了 25 个**基点**（Basis Points, bips: 金融领域用于描述利率或债券收益率变化的单位，1个基点等于0.01%）。但基于鲍威尔的一些评论，市场似乎并不太在意。我认为这与其说是鲍威尔的评论，不如说是降息的利好大部分已经被市场提前消化了。我们已经处于历史高位交易，即使盘前市场是红色的，我们基本上仍然在历史高点。所以，我们会谈谈这次降息的潜在影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've got big tech earnings, Meta, Microsoft, and Google. All three of these companies incredibly important. One of them did really good. The other two did okay. One of them's dumping. The other one's actually going up. The other one's flat. Meta's dumping. Google's up. Microsoft's flat. So, we'll talk about it. We got the Fed rate cut yesterday. That was a big deal. We got those 25 bips. Market kind of didn't care based on some of the comments JPAL made. I think it was less about the comments JPAL made. I think it was more about the fact that a lot of it was already priced in. We were already trading at all time highs. We're basically already still at alltime highs even though we are red in the pre-markets. And so we will talk about kind of the implications of that rate cut.</p>
</details>

然后昨晚发生了两件大事，几乎是同时发生的。第一，Palantir 的股价在一夜之间达到了 200 美元，这有点疯狂，但它昨晚确实一度站上了 200 美元大关。今天也许能回去，也许不能。无论如何，能看到 Palantir 达到这个位置已经非常感激了。我想很多人昨晚看到这种势头和潜力都会感到欣慰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then yesterday last night we had two major thing happened, two two major things kind of take place at the same time. Number one is you had this guy hit $200 overnight, which is kind of crazy, but Palanteer has a two-handle in front of it or it had a two-handle in front of it last night. Maybe we get it back today, maybe we don't. Either way, very grateful for Palanteer to even be in this position. And I think a lot of people were grateful to see the momentum and potential of that momentum last night.</p>
</details>

第二，特朗普和习近平就他们据称达成的协议进行了沟通。现在很多人都在问，等等，为什么盘前市场是红色的？到底发生了什么？特朗普和习真的正式签署协议了吗？这就是我们节目今天要开始讨论的话题。协议是达成了，但没有正式签署。我认为问题就出在这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then number two, you also had Trump and Xi communicate on the deal that they supposedly make. Now, a lot of people are asking right now, wait a second, why are are we red in the pre-market? Like, what's going on right here? Have Trump and G officially signed a deal? And this is what we're going to start off with for the show, and we'll kind of talk about what's going on. But a deal was made, but a deal was not officially signed. And I think that's the issue.</p>
</details>

在韩国一个私人军事会议室里经过大约一个半小时的谈判后，特朗普和习走出来，但并没有真正对媒体发表讲话，没有开新闻发布会，也没有正式说明具体情况。特朗普随后在“空军一号”上谈了许多关于协议可能包含的内容。Bessant（财政部长）早上澄清了一些事情，这就是你现在看到盘前市场出现红色势头的原因。我真的认为这是因为市场还没有完全相信我们已经达成了协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">aka after the two hours of negotiating, it was about an hour and a half in this private military room in South Korea, Trump and Xi came out and they didn't really address the media. They didn't have a press conference. They didn't officially say exactly what's going on. Trump on Air Force One then said a bunch of different things for what the deal would entail. Bass clarified some stuff in the morning and that's why you're getting some of the red momentum you're seeing in the pre-markets right here. I genuinely think it's because the market doesn't fully believe we have a deal yet.</p>
</details>

标普指数现在是 684 点，下跌了 0.5%。昨天我们还在 689 点。所以这并不是什么可怕的下跌。我们得等到 9:30 开盘看看会发生什么。但英伟达从 212 跌到 203，Palantir 从 200 跌到 197，Robinhood 从 147 跌到 141，特斯拉从 465 跌到 455。很明显，市场上普遍出现了红色蜡烛图。唯一没怎么跌的股票是谷歌，因为它的季度业绩堪称完美，所以谷歌上涨了 8%。但市场对这个中美协议的解读方式确实很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know S&P is at 684. It's down half a percent. We were at 689 yesterday. Like this is not some horrendous red. We'll see at 930 what happens. But Nvidia 212 to 203. Palanteer 200 to 197. Robin Nood 147 to 141. Tessy 465 to 455. I mean you definitely have red candles across the board. One of the only stocks that's not really red is Google because I mean it was just a perfect quarter and that's why Google's up 8% right here. But it it is quite fascinating how the market is interpreting this shiny deal.</p>
</details>

市场似乎在说，我们不会再像过去几个月那样，因为你告诉我们有协议就上当了，我们要等到协议真正官宣才会相信。尽管特朗普确实给出了一些你想象中必须经过谈判才能确定的具体细节，但由于没有美国大使馆的官方声明，也没有中国外交部的官方声明，市场就表现出“我们不信”的态度。所以我认为这就是我们盘前下跌的原因。我们会讨论那个协议的影响，但这是我对我们下跌原因的最佳逻辑解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Almost like the market's saying we are not going to fall prey to what has happened over the past couple months when you told us there was a deal and we're going to wait until it's actually official. Even if even though Trump did give some specific details that you would imagine had to be negotiated, but because there is no official statement from the US embassy, no official statement from the Chinese foreign ministry, the market's kind of just like we don't believe it. And so I think that's why we're red.</p>
</details>

那么，为什么加密货币也下跌了？我不知道。如果有人能向我解释为什么比特币和以太坊这两个资产无法吸引买盘，我很想听听。比特币回到了 108K，周一还是 116K。降息了，不在乎。中美合作了，不在乎。我感觉比特币和加密货币领域可能正在发生一些更深层次的事情，但我们会讨论并看看情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll talk about the implications of that deal, but that's my best kind of logic for why we're red. Now, why is crypto red? I don't know, dude. Crypto cryptos I if someone else can explain to me why these two assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, cannot catch a bid, I would love to hear. Bitcoin back to 108. It was 116 on Monday. Back to 108. Rate cut, don't care. China cooperation, don't care. I mean, I feel like something deeper is going on with Bitcoin and in crypto, but we'll talk about it and we'll see kind of what's going on.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头财报深度解析

好的，我们先来谈谈科技巨头的财报，然后再讨论中国问题，因为我看到这里有很多关于 Meta 的问题。首先，非常感谢大家来到这里，也感谢那些昨天坚持了 9 小时 45 分钟的朋友们。那是一次有趣的经历。我妈妈给我发短信说：“你直播了九个小时？”我说：“是的，那是相当疯狂的一天。”我爸爸打电话给我，他很生气，说：“你吃东西了吗？你为什么要直播那么久？”我说：“爸爸，昨天是重要的一天。”他说：“你吃了吗？”我说：“是的，我吃了。”只要你吃了，印度父母就开心了。我吃了街边的鸡肉和西兰花。但我很感谢所有留下来的人，那是非常愉快的一天。感觉不像九个小时，因为事情太多了，就像和朋友们一起玩了九个小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, all right. So, let's get into the China deal and we'll get into it. First of all, real quick, we're going to talk a lot about Meta, but what's going on with Meta? The the simple thing for Meta right here, actually, why don't we start with Meta? Let's do big tech earnings, then we'll do China because I see a lot of questions right here about Meta. And so, let's get into it. And again, thank you everybody for being here. Thank you for those who stayed for the uh nine hours and 45 minutes yesterday. It was a fun experience. My mom texted me. She was like, "Were you were you live for nine hours?" And I was like, "Yeah, it was it was a pretty wild day." My dad called me. He was like, he was he was upset. He's like, "Did you eat anything?" Like, "What's going why are you live?" I was like, "Dad, like it was a big day." He's like, "Did you eat?" I was like, "Yes, I ate." As as long as you eat, Indian parents are like, "If you eat, they're happy. That's all that like as long as you eat, they're okay." I was like, "Yes, I ate. I had some chicken and broccoli on the street. I ate." But uh yeah, no, I appreciate everyone who stayed. It was a really fun day. And uh it didn't even feel like nine hours to be honest with there was so much going on that it kind of just it felt like it was it was it was hanging out with your friends for nine hours. So it's a good time and thank you everybody for being here. We'll probably do it again in the future if we have those crazy days um where we have to cover everything for the markets.</p>
</details>

#### Meta：一次性税费与激进资本支出引发股价震荡

好了，我们开始吧。Meta 怎么了？Meta 下跌基本上有两个原因。第一，他们计提了一笔 150 亿美元的一次性税收费用。我认为这是一个愚蠢的下跌理由，所以我昨天逢低买入了。我在 750 美元买了一些，为了好玩买了五股，算是为财报投入点资金。然后昨天它跌到 684 美元左右时我又买了一点，考虑到它后来反弹到 750 美元，我觉得这个价格还不错。现在又回到了 672 美元，所以显然下跌还在继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Meta, what's going on with Meta? Meta basically there there's two reasons why Meta's down. Number one is that they took a onetime $15 billion tax charge. Uh I thought that was a stupid reason for Meta to fall. So I bought the dip yesterday. So, I bought at 750, bought five shares for the hell of it. Say, let's have some skin in the game for earnings. And then I bought a little bit more at around 684 when it dropped yesterday, which I I thought was a decent price given that it rebounded all the way to 75. Now, it's back to 672. So, obviously, the dip keeps dipping. And I think a lot of you guys in the chat from what we were talking about also uh bought the dip.</p>
</details>

这笔近 160 亿美元的税收费用让华尔街感到恼火。我不知道为什么，因为公司终究要交税。你可以因为他们交税而打压股价，但这又不是他们不交税，那才是打压股价的另一个理由。这导致了**每股收益**（Earnings Per Share, EPS: 公司利润除以流通股数，是衡量盈利能力的重要指标）未达预期。因此，该股每股收益为 1.06 美元，而预期为 6.60 美元，华尔街对此非常不满。如果没有那 160 亿美元的税收费用，他们的每股收益本应达到 7.25 美元左右，会超出预期 10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's two reasons. The six this basically $16 billion tax charge was something that the street was annoyed with. Uh I don't know why because at the end of the day, companies have to pay their taxes. So, it's like I mean you can take the stock down for them paying their taxes, but it's not like, you know, it's not like they're not paying their taxes, which would be a different reason to take the stock down. So, that uh caused an EPS miss. And as a result of that EPS miss, um the stock put up a dollar six a share versus 660. And the street got pretty upset about that. If they didn't have that $16 billion tax charge, they would have beat by 720 or they would have beat by 10% because the EPS would have been about 725.</p>
</details>

第二个让华尔街不满的是，扎克伯格基本上表示，对于 2026 财年，他们将在**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure, capex: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）上投入得更激进，华尔街非常不喜欢这一点。我有点困惑。华尔街希望他们花更多的钱。谷歌也说他们要增加资本支出，从 850 亿增加到 930 亿。为什么华尔街对谷歌不生气？当然，谷歌的季度报告中其他部分表现非常好，但这几乎就像他们在惩罚 Meta 增加资本支出，因为他们不相信这会对公司的运营指标产生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that was the first thing the street was upset about. The second thing the street was upset about is that Zucks basically said for fiscal year 2026, yeah, diluted EPS was great. For fiscal year 2026, they are spending more aggressively on capex and the street really didn't like that. And I am a bit confused. We have a couple of analysts that that have put some thoughts out on beta that that we'll talk about in a second, but I was a bit confused by that because the street wants them to spend more. I mean, Google said they're going to spend more on capex. They went from 85 billion to 93 billion. Why is the street not upset about the gooks? Now granted, Google had other parts of its quarter that were really good, but it's almost like they're punishing Meta for spending more on capex because it's like they don't believe that it's having an impact on their operating metrics.</p>
</details>

但当你查看运营指标时，收入增长了 26%。这是一家市值 2 万亿美元的公司。谷歌的增长率都没有 26%。Meta 的增长几乎像早期的 SaaS 公司一样，这令人印象深刻。营业收入增长 18%，日活跃用户增长 8%。我不知道他们怎么能不断找到更多人来使用这个平台。他们的核心指标广告展示量增长了 14%，每个广告的价格上涨了 10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then when you look at the operating metrics, revenue is up 26%. This is a $2 trillion company. Google's not growing at 26%. You know, Meta Meta is growing almost like a like a SAS company in the early days, which is impressive. Operating income is up 18%. Daily active people is up 8%. I don't know how they keep finding more people to use this platform. Ad impressions, their core metric is up 14%. And their price per ad is up 10%.</p>
</details>

谷歌的季度业绩确实令人难以置信，但市场似乎认为人工智能对谷歌的影响更大。有一些指标可以支持这种分析，比如 Gemini 的使用率、API 使用率等等。所以这很公平，谷歌理应获得他们现在得到的溢价和势头。坦白说，如果他们在开盘后突破 300 美元，我一点也不会惊讶。但市场似乎就是不喜欢 Meta 在人工智能方面的做法，他们不认为这会产生像谷歌从人工智能中获得的那种影响。此外，Meta 没有云业务。而谷歌有一个非常赚钱的云业务，将其营业利润率从 17% 提高到 23%，这并不容易，并且保持了 34% 的增长率。所以，也许这就是区别所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, Google had an incredible quarter, but it's almost like the market is thinking that AI is having a bigger impact on Google. And there are some metrics to to make that analysis with Gemini usage, API usage, all that stuff. So, so that's fair and Google deserves their premium uh and their momentum that they're getting right here. And quite frankly, it would not surprise me if they break 300 in the in the market open. But it's almost like the streets just doesn't like what Meta is doing with AI and they don't think that it's going to have the type of impact that Google is getting from AI. Also, Meta doesn't have a cloud business. And you know, Google has a very juicy cloud business that increased their operating margins from 17% to 23%. Not easy to do and kept the growth rate at at 34%. And so, and so maybe that's the difference.</p>
</details>

我对此的总体看法是，一年后我们回过头来看，如果 Meta 的人工智能实力产生了任何有意义的影响，那么我认为人们会觉得今天的反应很可笑。不过，过去几天我确实说过我担心 Meta，因为扎克伯格花钱如流水，华尔街可能会对此感到不满。是的，华尔街确实不满了。但并不是说他疯狂花钱影响了收益。这就是 Meta 在表面上遇到的典型问题。你会想：“哦，扎克伯格花钱如流水。除了能提升广告效果外，没有大规模的人工智能护城河。所以华尔街可能会不高兴。”但当你看到数据时，数据是惊人的。即使他仍在疯狂花钱，也意味着他们能够承受所有这些疯狂的支出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh my overall thought on this is that I think a year from now we're going to look back and if Meta has any meaningful impact from their AI prowess, then I think this will be something that people look back and laugh at. I did say over the past couple days though that I was worried about Meta simply because Zux is spending like crazy and the street could get upset about that. And yeah, the street is upset about that. But it's not like him spending like crazy affected the earnings. And and and you know, and this is kind of the the typical issue with Meta on on the on the sort of like base surface level. You're like, "Oh, Zux is spending like crazy. There's no massive AI moat outside of the AI increasing the advertising. So maybe the street gets upset." But when you look at the numbers, the the numbers are phenomenal. Even if he's still spending like crazy, which means they're able to stomach all the crazy spend.</p>
</details>

但这一次，华尔街就是不高兴。我认为这可能是因为他们对税收费用的看法，以及他在财报电话会议上回答问题的方式，让人们觉得他在人工智能故事方面可能没有完全准备好。再说一次，我认为一年后回看会觉得这很愚蠢。Meta 现在的市盈率是 2026 财年盈利的 21 倍。我们谈论的是一家数万亿美元的公司，市盈率只有 21 倍。我认为它必须是“科技七巨头”中最便宜的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh but but but this time the street just wasn't happy about it. And I think it's maybe because of the perception of not only the tax charge they took, but then the way he answered questions on the earnings call that just made them feel like maybe he doesn't have everything together in regards to an AI story, which again, I think in a year from now, it's going to be stupid. Meta is now trading at 21 times fiscal year 2026 earnings. We're talking about Meta. We're talking about a multi-t trillion dollar company trading at 21 time. I mean, I I think it has to be the cheapest Mac 7. When the market opens, we'll look at the multiples, but I don't know. It feels rather attractive.</p>
</details>

我很好奇他们会把 Meta 的股价打压到多低。每股收益下降 84% 确实不好看。但再次强调，他们的每股收益实际上并没有下降 84%，他们只是必须支付税款。所以我宁愿一家公司支付税款而不是不支付。在某个时候，你必须支付。这是一次性费用。这就是为什么我最初看到这些数字时，觉得这不可能是真的。但当你深入了解会计细节后，就会发现，好吧，他们必须交税。所以我不认为税收费用是华尔街将其股价打压 10% 的原因。我认为这里有更深层次的问题，关乎对扎克伯格和人工智能的信任，因为华尔街足够聪明，不会因为一笔税收费用而纠结，但无论如何，你现在看到了 Meta 正在承受的痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am curious to see how bad they're going to take Meta down. EPS down 84% is not good. Again, their EPS is not actually down 84%. They had to pay their taxes. So, I would rather a company pay their taxes than not pay their taxes. And at some point, you have to pay it. It's a a one-time charge. You know, that's why when I saw the numbers originally, I was like, this can't be real. But then when you look behind the hood in the accounting, it's like, okay, so they have to pay their taxes. So, I don't think the taxes the tax charge is why the street is taking it down 10%. I think there's something deeper here around the trust around Zucks and AI because the street's smart enough to move on from a tax charge, but nonetheless, you're seeing the pain that you're getting right here on Meta.</p>
</details>

我们来看看一些分析师的看法。美国银行将他们的目标价从 900 美元下调至 810 美元。这再次印证了华尔街并不完全满意，但他们仍然维持买入评级。他们表示：“我们预计 Meta 股票将备受争议，因为 2026 年的**每股收益**（EPS）增长前景有限，且自由现金流面临同比压力。然而，我们认为 Meta 处于强势地位，拥有庞大的用户网络，并有机会在未来几年整合引人注目的人工智能产品。我们相信，关于支出的坏消息现在大部分已经反映在股价中，而产品催化剂，包括新的**大型语言模型**（Large Language Model, LLM: 一种基于海量文本数据训练的人工智能模型）和内容创作工具，可以推动 26 年的参与度和收入增长。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so let's read some of the analysts and what they had to say. So, uh, Bank of America, they lowered their price target from 900 to 810. Again, going to this argument that the street is not exactly the happiest, but they still have a buy target. We expect Meta stock to be controversial giving an a limited EPS growth outlook in a year-over-year free cash flow pressure in 2026. However, we see Meta in a position of strength with a massive user network and the opportunity to integrate compelling AI products over the next few years. We believe the bad news on expenses is now mostly in the stock while product catalyst including a new large language model and content creation tools can drive upside engagement and revenue in 26.</p>
</details>

Rosenblat 则表示他们的目标价是 1117 美元。“Meta 的 2025 年第三季度业绩非常出色。第四季度销售额同比增长 2024% 的高端指引比预期高出 3%。因此，他们在指引上超出了预期。收盘后的担忧来自支出。Meta 建议预计资本支出为 720 亿美元，高于此前的 660 亿美元。他们在 2026 年的资本支出将‘显著’增加，这是扎克伯格使用的原话。但我们综合考虑后，仍然上调了第四季度和 2026 年的 **EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）和调整后每股收益的预期，从而将我们的目标价上调了 3%。这些人工智能投资的顶级回报似乎支持了这笔支出。我们维持买入评级。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rosenblat says hey uh 1117 is our price target. Meta's 3Q 20225 was great. The guidance for the high end of 2024% year-over-year growth in fourth quarter sales is 3% above estimates. So they beat on guidance. Consternation postc close comes from spending. Meta advised of expectations to spend 72 billion on capex up from 66 billion. So their increase in capex to absorb expenses this year of 118 billion. In 2026 capex spend is up to notably larger that was the exact word Zux used notably in dollar terms while 2026 expenses are set to grow at a significantly faster rate rate but we net it out and still end up raising IBIDA and adjusted EPS estimates for fourth quarter in 2026 driving our price target up 3%. The topline ROI on these AI investments appears to support the spend. We maintain our buy rating and raise our price to 3%.</p>
</details>

所以你有两种不同的观点。一种观点是，嘿，它很便宜，但我们不会给它一个超高的目标价，因为我们担心开支。另一种观点是，嘿，即使有这些开支，它也很便宜，我们要给它一个很高的目标价，因为它的增长和其他任何科技公司一样强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have two different perspectives. One perspective is hey it's cheap but we're not going to give it a super big price target because we're afraid of expenses. The other argument is hey it's cheap even with the expenses we're going to give it a high price target because the growth is as strong as any other tech company that's out there.</p>
</details>

另一个担忧是扎克伯格在眼镜和 Reality Labs 上的投入太多，而 Reality Labs 持续亏损。我个人也不看好眼镜和元宇宙。但即使考虑到所有这些因素，如果 Meta 能够实现这种盈利增长，它仍然是便宜的。现在，如果他们的人工智能除了广告之外做不了任何事情——这也是我们过去几周一直在思考的担忧，它只是广告，没有像谷歌、亚马逊、微软那样的云服务商，也没有像 Llama 那样被广泛使用的 LLM，Gemini 的月活跃用户刚刚达到 6.5 亿。除了 Facebook 和 Instagram，没有任何消费产品在日常基础上使用 AI。如果除了广告什么都没有，那么所有的花费都去哪儿了？我想这也是很多人在思考的问题。

<p class="english-text">Well, that's another concern. Zux is spending on the glasses and Reality Labs continues to lose money. So, that's also not the best thing in the world for Meta. I'm not a big fan of the glasses. I'm not a big fan of Reality Labs, the metaverse thing. I don't know why he keeps working on it. But again, when you look at the numbers, even if you take all that into consideration, Meta still becomes cheap if they're able to put up this earnings growth. Now, if their AI is not able to do anything other than advertising, which has been the concern I think a lot of us have been thinking about over the past couple weeks, that it's just ads. There's no cloud provider like Google, Amazon, Microsoft. Amazon and Apple do have earnings today, so that's going to be important. There's no uh LLM like Llama is not something that people use. Gemini just hit 650 million monthly activives. There's not really any of this of a consumer product outside of Facebook and Instagram that is using AI on a daily basis, although they have like their meta AI. If there's nothing else besides ads, then it's like where exactly is all the spend going to? And I think that's what a lot of people are thinking about as well.</p>

#### 谷歌：完美财报推动股价逆市上扬

现在我们来谈谈谷歌。首先，如果你重仓持有谷歌，你应该为自己感到骄傲。这只股票从一月到八月，直到它最终开始上涨，确实需要相当大的信念才能坚持下来。在不到四个月的时间里，谷歌的市值几乎翻了一番，对于一家现在价值近 3.5 万亿美元的公司来说，这简直令人难以置信。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, Google. Let's talk about the googs. First of all, if you own googs and you're heavy into googs, uh you got to give yourself a pat on the back. I mean, this stock did take a bit of hardcore conviction to stick through uh in the months basically from January till call it August until it finally started making a move. Google has basically doubled in less than four months for a company that is now worth almost 3.5 trillion. I mean it is just incredible to see.</p>
</details>

那么 Sundar Pichai 交出了怎样的成绩单呢？他们每分钟处理 70 亿个 token。Gemini 的月活跃用户从 4.5 亿增长到 6.5 亿。云业务同比增长 34%，首次实现季度收入百亿，积压订单达 1550 亿美元，Google One 和 YouTube 的付费订阅用户达到 3 亿。就连埃隆·马斯克看到这些财报后都不得不说：“干得不错。”我认为这是一个完美的季度。我们昨天听了财报电话会议，会议非常精彩。Sundar 状态极佳，基本上解释了他们正在构建的生态系统以及它如何开始奏效，并且你真的开始看到广告业务的成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what did Sunder put up? Well, they're doing 7 billion tokens per minute. They have 650 million monthly activives up from 450 million in uh Gemini. 34% year-over-year cloud first hundred billion revenue quarter $155 billion backlog and $300 million paid subscriptions across Google One and YouTube. I mean, even Elon had to say, "Nice work." After seeing those earnings, I thought this was a perfect quarter. I mean, I we listened to the call yesterday. Call was incredible. Sundar was on top of his game. Basically explained how they are building the ecosystem that they're building and how it's starting to work and you're really starting to see the advertising result.</p>
</details>

从视觉上看，毛利润为 610 亿美元。搜索业务同比增长 15%，比上一季度的 12% 有所加速。YouTube 收入 100 亿，Google Play 121 亿，谷歌云 152 亿。总体净利润方面，谷歌每赚一美元，就有 35 美分进入净收入，利润高达 350 亿美元。这太不可思议了。谷歌当之无愧。我认为这只股票会涨到 300 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what it looks like on a visual basis. Gross profit was 61 billion. Search, by the way, up 12% year-over-year. Search is not slowing down. Or actually, sorry, search is up 15% year-over-year. Last quarter was 12%. So, it actually accelerated quarter over quarter. YouTube's at 10 billion. Uh Google Play is at 12.1, Google Cloud at 15.2. And then overall net profit, Google, basically every dollar that came into the business, 35 cents of those dollars came into the net income. 35 billion in profits. It's incredible. It's absolutely incredible. Google deserves it. I think this one's going to 300. Seems pretty obvious right here that it has a shot to get there.</p>
</details>

事实上，由于中美关系问题，盘前市场普遍下跌，但谷歌却上涨了。我不确定谷歌能否保持涨势，但它逆整个市场而行，表明市场对它有多么兴奋。高盛将目标价上调至 330 美元，并表示谷歌云是业绩的亮点。此外，你还有 Waymo 和量子计算。Waymo 正在增长，Sundar 表示明年将进入东京和伦敦。然后是量子计算，无论它未来会变成什么，谷歌都在那里取得进展。所以，谷歌有很多令人兴奋的元素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that Google Here's the other thing. The fact that we're red in the pre-markets because of this China stuff that we're about to talk about and Google's green. I don't know if Google can hold the green, but the fact that Google is going the opposite of the entire market and saying, "Nope, we are not letting this one fall away." Uh, you're seeing a lot more excitement with how the tree is thinking about it. Here is what uh Goldman said. They raised their price target to 330 and they said uh Google cloud was the highlight of the results with our in our view 34% revenue growth 79% revenue backlog growth a change of 2025 capex guidance from 85 billion to 93 billion... You've also got Whimo and Quantum, right? You've got Whimo that is starting to grow. Uh Sundar said it's going to to Tokyo and London next year. And then you got quantum, whatever that could turn into, Google's making progress there. So, you just got a lot of different elements to Google to be excited about. And I mean, I don't think it's it's something people would be scared of selling right here.</p>

#### 微软：业绩稳健但增长指引略逊预期

最后我们来谈谈微软。微软股价 525 美元，下跌了 3%。他们下跌有两个原因。第一，根据重组计划，他们承担了 31 亿美元的 OpenAI 冲击。顺便说一句，路透社昨晚报道，OpenAI 计划在 2027 年以一万亿美元的估值上市。微软将拥有那万亿美元 IPO 的约 30%，这对微软是利好，但他们确实承担了 30 亿美元的冲击，并且未来几个季度将调整收入预期，因为 OpenAI 将不再并表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Microsoft, last one we'll talk about, then we'll get into China and all the earnings that we got this morning. Uh Microsoft 525, that's down 3%. Microsoft, the reason they're down is for two reasons. Number one, they took a $3.1 billion OpenAI hit uh as per the restructuring. By the way, OpenAI reported last night, well, Reuters reported that they're trying to go public in 2027 at a trillion dollar valuation. Microsoft would own about 30% of that trillion dollar IPO. So that is bullish for Microsoft, but they did take a $3 billion hit and they're going to be adjusting their revenue estimates going over the next coming quarters because OpenAI is not going to be included anymore.</p>
</details>

微软下跌的另一个原因是，Azure 第四季度的“悄悄话数字”（whisper number，即非官方的市场普遍预期）略高于微软报告的官方指引。因此，尽管 Azure 第四季度增长了 40%，但华尔街期望更高，他们给出的数字略低。微软很可能最终会超过这个数字，但在短期内，如果你不能满足华尔街的期望，他们就会打压股价。我认为微软的情况完全不成问题，远比 Meta 的情况要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other reason that Microsoft is down is because the whisper number on Azure was slightly higher than what Microsoft reported for guidance for Q4. And as a result, although Azure grew 40% for Q4, Street was expecting a little bit higher, they came a little bit lower. Microsoft's probably going to beat that number anyway. But in the short term, until you give the street what they want, you know, they're going to hurt the stock. And so Microsoft is up 30% year to date. We saw it go to 550 on that opening ideal a couple days ago. I think this one is absolutely a nothing burger. This one is way more of a nothing burger than Meta because Meta, you know, Meta had to take that tax charge in the streets, not really believing their AI story as much as Microsoft, but Microsoft did get hit.</p>
</details>

对这三家科技公司的真正总结是，他们都交出了所需的业绩，为标普 500 指数可能达到 7000 点提供了理由。也许不是明天，也许不是这个月，甚至不是十一月，但如果你谈论的是一个基于公司持续报告良好业绩而可能获得更高市盈率的标普指数，那么 Meta、微软和谷歌都没有让人失望。这三家科技巨头都在营收和利润上实现了双双超预期，这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the the real summary of all three of these tech companies is that they put up the results they needed to put up to justify the S&P 500 potentially getting to 7,000. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this month, uh, you know, maybe not even in November, but if you're talking about an S&P that could get an exact a increased multiple based on companies continuing to report, Meta, Microsoft, and Google did not disappoint. Maybe Meta disappointed a bit with this tax thing, but if you look past that, you've got a beat on the top and the bottom line consistent with a lot of other companies, the big three companies in tech put up a beat on the top and the bottom line, which is very important.</p>
</details>

### 其他关键公司财报扫描

盘前财报方面，万事达卡营收和利润双双超预期。Roblox 也是双超预期，但股价却下跌了 7%，可能是指引或电话会议上的某些内容不佳。消费品公司 Crocs 和好时（Hershey's）也实现了双超预期。雅诗兰黛（Estee Lauder）业绩惊人，每股收益超出预期 78%。大型制药公司礼来（Eli Lilly）和默克（Merck）也公布了强劲的业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, earnings in the pre-market. Let's look at that real quick and then we'll get into what happened with China last night. So, we had a bunch of different companies. Uh, first off, Mastercard beat on the top and the bottom. Then you had Roblox. They lost 37 cents a share versus 51 cents. They beat by 27%. Another beat on the top and the bottom. Roblox right now down 7%. All right. So although you had a top and the bottom beat, looks like something in guidance or something in the call maybe not going the best and that's why the street took them down. Crocs consumer company beat by 24% on EPS. Again, another beat on the top and the bottom. Uh you had Hershey's, another consumer company, beat on the top and the bottom. One of my favorite companies, Estee Lau, dude, beat by 78%. Big Pharma, Eli Liy top and the bottom beat. Then you had Merc more big pharma up 10% EPS or a beat by 10%.</p>
</details>

我们在整个市场看到的是，这些利润率的提高导致了每股收益的超预期，或者说许多公司整体运营结构更好了。看到近 80% 的标普 500 公司盈利超预期，很难说经济存在巨大的结构性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think what we're seeing across the entire market are these margin efficiencies that are causing these EPS or just overall better operating structure from a lot of these companies that need to continue inching out a profit. I mean, it's hard to see almost 80% of the S&P 500 beat on earnings and say there's a massive structural problem in the economy.</p>
</details>

昨晚另一家值得关注的公司是 Chipotle。我不知道 Chipotle 发生了什么，但它下跌了 18%。CEO 基本上说，年收入低于 10 万美元的消费者不再光顾他们的店了。这与麦当劳的说法类似，所以我们需要关注这个问题。是这些面向中低收入人群的消费品公司因为需求问题而客流量下降，还是他们的食物本身有问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other company that we should talk about that had earnings last night and then we'll get into this China stuff is Chipotle. I don't know what's going on with Chipotle, but it's down 18%. We listened to the CEO a little bit and basically he said that um the consumer that makes less than $100,000 is not showing up to our store. McDonald's did say the same thing. So it's something we have to keep track of. Are these consumer companies that are catering towards people in that 100,000 or less income bracket? Are they not seeing the type of foot traffic because there's a demand issue and like people can't afford to eat Chipotle, McDonald's, etc. Or does the food just suck?</p>

### 中美协议迷雾：市场为何不买账？

好了，我们来谈谈中国，谈谈美国和中国。我知道很多人对我们在所谓的与中国达成协议后，现在市场为何是红色的感到困惑。这是特朗普和习四年来首次会面。握手很坚定，但人们观察肢体语言后发现，特朗普没有像往常一样把对方拉向自己，这被解读为一种尊重的表示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's talk about China. Let's talk about the US and China. I know a lot of people are confused about why we're red right now after the uh supposed deal that we got with China, but let's uh let's talk a little bit more about kind of what's going on right here. So, this was them meeting for the first time in about four years. The handshake was strong, but it's not, you know, people were observing the body language and they were like Trump didn't like legit pull him into uh you know, Trump usually pulls somebody into when you're doing the the handshake, so it wasn't as aggressive, which people were saying was a sign of like respect or whatever.</p>
</details>

会后，特朗普在“空军一号”上表示，他们在许多非常重要的点上达成了共识，并将很快公布。他提到，大量的大豆和其他农产品将立即开始采购。在芬太尼问题上，他们同意中方将努力阻止其流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then this was Trump on Air Force One basically talking about the meeting afterwards even though they didn't have a press conference. "We've come to conclusion on many very important points and we'll be handing that to you in a little while. We're in agreement on so many elements. Tremendous amounts of the soybeans and other farm products are going to be purchased immediately, starting immediately. We on fentinol, we agreed that he was going to work very hard to stop the flow."</p>
</details>

根据特朗普在“空军一号”上的讲话，协议成果大致如下：美中将在乌克兰问题上合作；特朗普将于 2026 年 4 月访华，习将很快访美；中国将开始购买大豆并恢复稀土出口。关于英伟达，他说美中将继续深入讨论芯片限制，但他特别提到不确定 Blackwell 芯片的情况。总体而言，对华关税将从 57% 降至 47%，芬太尼关税将大幅削减至 10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The US and China will collaborate on Ukraine. Trump will visit China in April of 2026 and Xi will visit the US soon. China will begin buying soy soybeans and resume rare earth exports. On Nvidia, he did say the US and China will continue to further discuss Nvidia chip restrictions. He specifically said, I don't know about Blackwell, but we will still discuss chip restrictions. Which is discouraging if you're an Nvidia investor because, you know, if Blackwell can't be shipped, you know, the Chinese probably don't care. And then overall, China tariffs are going to be cut from 57% to 47%. And then fentinel tariffs will be slashed to 10% and China is going to be working on the stop of the spread for for China.</p>
</details>

问题在于，我们没有看到任何双方的联合新闻发布会。你可能会想，经过这样一次策划已久的会晤和谈判，他们应该会有一个双边新闻发布会。也许是出于后勤考虑，他们觉得需要贸易代表进行更深入的技术性讨论。又或者，根本就没有真正的协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is we didn't get any joint press conference with with both of them and you would think after a deal I mean it's not like these guys can easily just go on a plane and meet each other like this was trip was planned for a long time. You would think after the negotiations they would have a dual press conference and have a conversation. Maybe logistically they felt that the trade representatives like Jameson Greer and Bent and Lee from China need to have a deeper discussion after Trump and Xi met in person and it was kind of a formality for Trump to meet Xi and for them to just like handshake agree on the stuff and then afterwards their trade representatives would come to a deeper technical conclusion on what the specifics of the deal would be like. Maybe that's what's playing out or maybe there's no freaking deal.</p>
</details>

我认为市场下跌有两个原因。第一，市场不认为这是一个合法的协议，在正式签署之前，市场不会在意。第二，我们昨天处于历史高位。所以，自然会有人获利了结。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the market, there's two reasons why the market's red right here. Even after an amazing big tech earnings and after this China stuff is number one, the market doesn't think there is a legit deal. And until it's signed, the market's not going to care. And then number two, we were at all-time highs yesterday. So, I mean, you know, we were pushing 690 on the S&P. You're probably going to have some people take profits.</p>
</details>

### 市场情绪与宏观观察

哦，天哪，他们真的把 Meta 打压到 650 美元了。如果 Meta 存在叙事上的压力，比如扎克伯格花费过多，那么短期内股价可能难以恢复。我们看到 2022 年发生了什么。我不是说它会再次跌得那么低，但这可能是短期内不易恢复的一个因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Oh, they're really taking Meta down to 650. Dude, goodness. If there is a narrative overhang on Meta, which is something to not ignore because we've seen stocks that get a stupid narrative overhang... I mean, we saw what happened back in 2022. I'm not saying that it would go that low again, but it could be something that is just not the easiest for the stock to recover from in the short term.</p>
</details>

顺便一提，Meta 宣布将进行 250 亿美元的六部分债券发售。这看起来是新的消息。我认为这才是股价受到重创的真正原因。华尔街不希望看到通过债务来为资本支出融资。Meta 是继甲骨文之后，第一家真正利用债务市场的公司。这让他们的总债务负担达到 700 亿美元。这可能是 Meta 股价下跌的更深层次原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, folks, I think this is actually the reason why Meta is taking a deeper hit. Let's get some coverage on this. Oh, that changes the story. 25 billion in debt is a little different. Guys, this looks new. This looks new. Meta is doing a six-part bond sale seeking to raise 25 billion ranging from 5 to 40 years. These are corporate bonds uh at a premium of 1.4% above treasuries. That okay, that that that that is actually why I think the stock is getting hit. The street does not want to see capex finance through debt. And Meta is the first company outside of Oracle to legitimately tap the debt markets. Their new total to debt load is 70 billion. In 2021 they had 14. Yeah that's actually that I mean that's probably the deeper reason why Meta is red.</p>
</details>

昨天鲍威尔也发表了讲话，他对当前科技行业的状况相当看好。他认为，现在的情况与“.com”泡沫时期不同，因为这些高市值的公司确实有盈利和商业模式。他承认，对设备和数据中心的投资是经济增长的重要来源之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last thing before the market opens, this is what JPAL said yesterday. He was pretty bullish on the state of tech right now. This is different in the sense that these companies that are so highly valued actually have earnings and stuff like that. So if you go back to the '9s and the dotcom, they were these are ideas rather than companies and you know we're we're so there's a clear bubble there whereas the you know the I won't go into particular names but they actually have earnings and you know it it looks like they have business models and uh and profits and that kind of thing. So it's it's really a different thing. The investment we're getting in um equipment and in all those things that go into creating data centers and and feeding the AI it's clearly part one of the big sources of growth in the economy.</p>
</details>

市场开盘了。Meta 股价跌至 665 美元。那笔债券发售确实改变了 Meta 的叙事。他们正在举债 250 亿美元，支付比美国国债高 1.4% 的利率。我认为这就是你看到其股价疲软的原因。Meta 市值蒸发了约 3000 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">9:30 a.m. Thank you everybody for being here. The stock market is now open. Meta 665. 665. that bond sale that definitely changes a bit more of the narrative on Meta if they are taking on debt for those that are just joining 25 billion in corporate bonds they are raising paying about 1.4% above a US Treasury note and as a result I think that's why you're seeing some weakness right there Meta 11% down 87 market cap just lost about 300 billion for Meta.</p>
</details>

市场一片血红，但苹果却上涨了。苹果市值远超 4 万亿美元。英伟达仍在 5 万亿，Meta 在 4.04 万亿，微软在 3.9 万亿。微软股价在 532 美元，下跌 2% 对微软来说不算什么。真正受重创的是 Meta。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apple, wow, 273. Markets bloody red and Apple goes up. Apple well above a $4 trillion market cap. Nvidia's at five still. Meta's at 4.04. And then Microsoft's at 3.9. Where is Microsoft stock right here? Microsoft is at 532. I mean, this is a nothing for Microsoft. I mean, down 2% is nothing. Meta is the one that's really getting hit.</p>
</details>

我认为，市场下跌的另一个原因，尽管很奇怪，是鲍威尔昨天在电话会议开始时说，我们不会确认 12 月是否会降息。虽然没人相信他真的不会在 12 月降息，但由于他昨天的强调，这可能让市场在走高前变得更加犹豫。再加上中美协议尚未正式确认，这些都可能是导致市场承压的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the reasons the market could be down as well, which again I think is a really weird reason. But yesterday pal started off the call by saying we are not going to confirm the validity of a December rate cut. No one believes it, but because Powell was stressing it yesterday, that could be another thing that's making the market a little bit more hesitant before going higher. And you could see that as a reason along with the fact that China US deal is not officially confirmed.</p>
</details>
