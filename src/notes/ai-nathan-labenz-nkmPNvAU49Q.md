### AI的真正潜力：超越语言模型

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
AI is not synonymous with language models. AI is being developed with pretty similar architectures for a wide range of different modalities and there's a lot more data there. Feedback is starting to come from reality. Maybe we're running out of problems we've already solved. When we start to give the next generation of the model these power tools and they start to solve previously unsolved engineering problems, I think you start to have something that looks kind of like super intelligence.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence）并非与**语言模型**（Language Models: 基于大量文本数据训练，能够理解和生成人类语言的模型）划等号。AI正以非常相似的架构为各种不同的**模态**（Modalities: 数据类型，如文本、图像、音频、视频等）而开发，并且那里有更多的数据。反馈正开始来自现实世界。也许我们正在耗尽那些已经解决的问题。当我们开始为下一代模型提供这些强大的工具，并且它们开始解决以前未解决的工程问题时，我认为你就开始拥有某种看起来像是超级智能的东西了。

### 审视AI发展：能力进步与社会影响

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Nathan, I'm stoked to stoked to have you on the AC and Z podcast for the first time. Obviously, I've been podcast partners for a long time with with you leading Cognitive Revolution. Welcome.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: Nathan，我非常高兴你第一次来到AC&Z播客。显然，我与你共同主持Cognitive Revolution播客已经很久了。欢迎你。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's great to be here. Thank you. So, we we were talking about Cal Newport's podcast appearance on lost debates and and we we thought it was a good opportunity to just have this broad conversation and really entertain this sort of question of is AI slowing down? Um, so why don't you sort of steelman some of the arguments that you've heard on that side either from him or more broadly and then we could sort of have this broader conversation.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 很高兴来到这里。谢谢。我们之前谈论了Cal Newport在"Lost Debates"播客上的露面，我们觉得这是一个很好的机会，可以进行一次广泛的对话，并真正探讨“AI是否正在放缓？”这个问题。那么，你能不能“**强论**”（Steelman: 采取对方论点最强形式进行分析）一下你从他那里或更广泛地听到的这类论点，然后我们再进行更广泛的讨论。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah, I mean I think for one thing um it's really important to separate a couple different questions I think with respect to AI. One would be is it good for us you know right now even and is it going to be good for us in the big picture? And then I think that is a very distinct question from are the capabilities that we're seeing continuing to advance and you know at a pretty healthy clip.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是的，我认为首先，在谈论AI时，将几个不同的问题区分开来非常重要。一个问题是，AI现在对我们有利吗？从长远来看，它会对我们有利吗？我认为这与我们所看到的能力是否在以相当快的速度持续进步，是两个截然不同的问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um so I actually found a lot of agreement with the uh Cal Newport podcast that you shared with me when it comes to some of the worries about the impact that AI might be having even already on people.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我实际上非常同意你分享给我的Cal Newport播客中的一些观点，尤其是在AI可能已经对人们产生的影响方面。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
you know, he he goes over looks over students shoulders and watches how they're working and finds that basically he thinks that they are using AI to be lazy, which is, you know, no big revelation.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他观察学生的学习方式，发现他们基本上都在利用AI偷懒，这也不是什么惊天大发现。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think a lot of teachers would tell you that. Puts that in Yeah. Puts that in maybe um more dressed up terms that that people are not even necessarily moving faster. uh but they're able to reduce the strain that the work that they're doing places on their own brains by kind of trying to get AI to do it and you know if that continues and I think you know he's been um I think a very valuable commenter on the impact of social media certainly I think we all should be mindful of how is my attention span uh you know evolving over time and am I getting weak or you know, uh, averse to hard work.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想很多老师都会这么说。他可能用更委婉的措辞表达，人们甚至不一定变得更快，但他们可以通过让AI来完成工作，从而减轻自己大脑的工作负担。如果这种情况持续下去，我认为他在社交媒体影响方面一直是位非常有价值的评论员。我们都应该注意自己的注意力广度是如何随时间变化的，以及我是否变得脆弱或者说，厌恶努力工作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Uh, those are not good trends if they are showing up in oneself. So, I think he's really right to watch out for that sort of stuff.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果这些趋势出现在自己身上，那可不是好兆头。所以，我认为他非常正确地提醒人们警惕这类问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And then, as we've covered it, you know, many conversations in the past, I've got a lot of questions about what the ultimate impact of AI is going to be. And I think he he probably does too.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后，正如我们过去多次讨论的那样，我对AI的最终影响有很多疑问。我想他可能也有同样的疑问。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But then when it comes to it's a strange move from my perspective to go from you know there's all these sort of problems today and maybe in the big picture to but don't worry it's flatlining like kind of worry but don't worry because it's not really going anywhere further than this or it's you know scaling has kind of petered out or you know we're not going to get better AI than we have right now.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但在我看来，从“今天存在所有这些问题，也许从大局来看”转变为“但别担心，它正在停滞不前”，这种转变很奇怪。它就像是某种“担心但又别担心”的论调，因为它不会再有进一步发展，或者说**规模化**（Scaling: 通过增加模型大小、数据量和计算资源来提升AI性能的方法）已经逐渐衰竭，又或者我们现在拥有的AI不会再变得更好了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
um or even maybe the most easily refutable claim from my perspective is GPT5 wasn't that much better than GPT4.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 或者说，在我看来，最容易驳斥的说法是**GPT-5**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer 5: OpenAI开发的最新一代大型语言模型）并没有比**GPT-4**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4: OpenAI开发的上一代大型语言模型）好多少。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that I think is where I really was like, whoa, wait a second. You know, I was with you on a lot of things. And some of the behaviors that he observes in the students, I would cop to having exhibited myself.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我觉得这才是让我真正感到“等等，慢着”的地方。你知道，我在很多事情上都同意你的看法。他观察到学生的一些行为，我承认自己也曾表现出来。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, when I'm trying to code something these days, a lot of times I'm like, "Oh man, can't the AI just figure it out?" You know, I really don't want to have to sit here and read this code and figure out what's going on. It's not even about typing the code anymore, you know, I'm way too lazy for that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 比如说，现在我尝试编写代码时，很多时候我都会想：“天哪，AI就不能自己搞定吗？”我真的不想坐在这里读代码，搞清楚发生了什么。现在甚至不是打代码的问题了，你知道，我懒得连那都做。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But it's even about like figuring out how the code is working just just case you just make it work. Uh try again, you know, and just try again and I'll I I do find myself at times falling into those traps.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 甚至连搞清楚代码是如何工作的都嫌麻烦，就想让它直接运行起来。不行就再试一次，你知道，就是再试一次。我确实有时会陷入这些陷阱。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I would say big part of the reason I can fall into those traps is because the AIs are getting better and better and increasingly it's not crazy for me to think that they might be able to figure it out.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我想说，我之所以会陷入这些陷阱，很大程度上是因为AI正变得越来越好，而且我越来越觉得它们或许真的能搞定这些问题，这种想法并不疯狂。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So that that's my kind of first um slice at the takes that I'm hearing. there's almost like a two by two matrix maybe that one could draw up where it's like do you think AI is good or bad you know now and in the future and do you think it's like not a big deal or a big deal and I'm I think it's both on the good and bad side I definitely think it's a big deal the the thing that I struggle to understand the most is the people who kind of don't see the big deal that it seems pretty obvious to me and the you know especially when it comes again to the the leap from GBD4 GB5 um maybe one reason that that's happened a little bit is that there were just a lot more releases between GPT4 and 5.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，这是我对目前听到的观点的初步看法。也许可以画一个二乘二的矩阵，问你觉得AI是好是坏（现在和未来），以及你觉得它是不是一件大事。我认为它既有好处也有坏处，我肯定认为它是一件大事。我最难以理解的是那些觉得这没什么大不了的人，因为在我看来这相当明显，尤其是在GPT-4到GPT-5的飞跃方面。也许出现这种情况的一个原因是，GPT-4和GPT-5之间发布了更多版本。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So what people are comparing to is, you know, something that just came out a few months ago, like 03, right? That only came out a few months before GBT5. Whereas with GBT4, it was, you know, shortly after ChatGpt and it was all kind of this moment of like, whoa, this thing is like exploding onto the scene.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 因此，人们比较的对象是几个月前才发布的东西，比如**GPT-4.0**（GPT-4.0: OpenAI在GPT-4和GPT-5之间发布的某个中间版本），对吧？它只在GPT-5之前几个月发布。而GPT-4是在ChatGPT发布后不久推出的，当时所有人都觉得“哇，这东西简直是横空出世”。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
A lot of people were seeing it for the first time. And if you look back to GPT3, you know, there's a huge leap. I would contend that the leap is similar from GPT4 to 5.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 很多人是第一次见到它。如果你回顾**GPT-3**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3: OpenAI开发的第三代大型语言模型），那是一个巨大的飞跃。我敢说，从GPT-4到GPT-5的飞跃也同样巨大。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
These things are hard to score. there's no, you know, single number that you could put on it. Well, there's loss. Uh, but of course, one of the big challenges is that like what exactly does a a loss number translate into in terms of capabilities.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这些东西很难量化评分。没有一个单一的数字可以用来衡量。当然，有**损失函数**（Loss Function: 衡量模型预测与实际结果之间差异的函数），但一个主要挑战是，损失函数数值究竟如何转化为实际能力。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, you know, it's very hard to to describe what exactly has changed. Um, but we could go through some of the dimensions of change if you want to and um, you know, enumerate some of the things that I think people maybe are starting to or have come to take for granted and kind of forget like that GPT4 didn't have a lot of the things that now, you know, were sort of expected in the GPD5 release because we'd seen them in 40 and 01 and 03 and all those, you know, things sort of, you know, maybe boiled the frog a little bit when it comes to how much progress people perceived in this last release.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，很难准确描述到底发生了什么变化。但是，如果你愿意，我们可以探讨一些变化的维度，并列举一些我认为人们可能已经开始或已经习以为常，并因此忘记了GPT-4并没有很多现在在GPT-5发布中被期待的功能。因为我们已经在4.0、4.01和4.03等版本中看到了它们，所有这些都让人们对最新发布的版本所感知到的进步，有点像“温水煮青蛙”一样。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, yeah, a couple reactions. So, one is and even to complicate your two by two even even further in the sense of, you know, is it bad now versus is it bad later? Like Cal is not really, you know, who we both admire by the way a lot.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 嗯，是的，有几点回应。首先，为了进一步复杂化你的二乘二矩阵，从“现在糟糕”还是“以后糟糕”的角度来看，Cal并不是，顺便说一下，我们都非常敬佩他。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Cal's a great guy and a valuable contributor to the the thought space, but he's not as concerned about sort of this sort of future AI concerns that um you know, sort of the AI safety folks and um many others are are are concerned about.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: Cal是个很棒的人，也是思想领域里一位有价值的贡献者，但他不像**AI安全**（AI Safety: 关注人工智能可能带来的灾难性风险，并研究如何减轻这些风险的领域）领域的人和许多其他人士那样，关注未来AI可能带来的担忧。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
he's more concerned about, you know, what it means to life for, you know, cognitive performance and and development now in the same way that he's worried about, you know, social media's impact.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 他更关心AI对当下认知表现和发展的影响，就像他担心社交媒体的影响一样。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And, you know, you you think that's a uh, you know, a concern, but not nowhere near as big a concern as as what to what to expect in the future.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 而且，你知道，你认为这是一个问题，但远不如对未来预期的担忧那么大。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And and then also he he presents sort of this theory of why we shouldn't worry about the future because it's slowing down.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 然后，他还提出了一个理论，解释了为什么我们不应该担心未来，因为AI正在放缓。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And why don't we just share what we how we interpreted kind of his history which as I interpreted it was this idea of like hey we figured out the simplistic version is we figured out this this way such that if you throw a bunch of data um into the model it gets better and sort of order of magnitude and so the difference between GB22 and GPD3 and then GBD3 and GBD4 um but then that sort of you know was significant the difference but then it achieved sort of a uh diminishing returns significantly and where we're not seeing it in GBD5 five and thus we don't have to worry anymore.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 我们不如分享一下我们是如何理解他所说的历史的，我的理解是这样的：我们发现了一个简化的方法，即向模型输入大量数据，它就会有数量级的提升，比如GPT-2到GPT-3，再到GPT-4，这些提升都非常显著。但之后，这种提升就出现了显著的**收益递减**（Diminishing Returns: 指在投入增加时，产出的增长速度逐渐减缓的现象），而在GPT-5中我们没有看到这种现象，所以我们就不必再担心了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
How would you edit the characterization of his view of sort of the the history and then we can get into the differences between four and five the scaling law idea which is you know it's definitely worth agreeing taking a moment to to note that it is not a law of nature.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 你会如何修正他关于这段历史的观点描述？然后我们可以讨论GPT-4和GPT-5之间的差异，以及**规模法则**（Scaling Law: 指模型性能随模型大小、数据量和计算资源的增加而呈现可预测的提升趋势）这个概念。要知道，我们值得花点时间指出，它并非自然法则。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know we do not have a principled reason to believe that scaling is some law that will go indefinitely. All we really know is that it has held through quite a few orders of magnitude so far.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 我们没有理论上的理由相信规模化是一种会无限持续的法则。我们真正知道的是，到目前为止，它已经持续了相当多的数量级。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think that it's really not clear yet to me whether or not the scaling laws have petered out or whether we have just found a steeper gradient of improvement that is giving us better ROI on another uh front that we can push on.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为目前还不清楚规模法则是否已经失效，或者我们只是找到了一个更陡峭的改进坡度，这在另一个我们可以努力的领域为我们带来了更好的**投资回报率**（ROI: Return on Investment，衡量投资效率的指标）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So they did train a a much bigger model which was GBT4.5 and that did get released and there are a number of interesting you know of course there's a million benchmarks whatever the one that I zero in on the most in terms of understanding how GBT 4.5 relates to both 03 and GBT 5 and OpenAI obviously famously terrible at naming we can all agree on that I think a decent amount of this confusion and sort of disagreement actually does stem from unsuccessful naming decisions.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以他们确实训练了一个更大的模型，那就是**GPT-4.5**（GPT-4.5: OpenAI推出的一个介于GPT-4和GPT-5之间的模型），它也发布了。当然，有很多有趣的基准测试，但我在理解GPT-4.5如何与GPT-4.03和GPT-5相关联时，最关注的一个是**Simple QA**（Simple QA: 一个衡量模型对大量晦涩事实性知识掌握程度的基准测试）。OpenAI在命名方面显然出了名的糟糕，我想我们都能同意这一点。我认为相当一部分的困惑和分歧实际上都源于不成功的命名决策。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
4.5 on this one benchmark called simple QA which is really just a super longtail trivia benchmark. It it really just measures do you know a ton of esoteric facts and they're not things you can really reason about. You either just have to know or don't know these particular facts.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: GPT-4.5在Simple QA这个基准测试上的表现，Simple QA实际上是一个超长尾的琐事基准测试。它真正衡量的是你是否知道大量晦涩的事实，而且这些事实你无法真正通过推理得出。你要么知道这些特定的事实，要么不知道。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The 03 class of models got about a 50% on that benchmark and GPT4.5 popped up to like 65%. So in other words, it basically of the things that were not known to the previous generation of models, it picked up a third of them.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: GPT-4.03系列模型在该基准测试中获得了大约50%的得分，而GPT-4.5则跃升至约65%。换句话说，对于上一代模型不知道的事实，它掌握了其中的三分之一。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Now there's obviously still two-thirds more to go, but I would say that's a pretty significant leap, right? These are super longtail questions. I would say most people would get like close to a zero.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 当然还有三分之二的进步空间，但我想说这是一个相当大的飞跃，对吧？这些都是超长尾的问题。我想大多数人会得到接近零分。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
you know, you'd be like the person sitting there at the trivia night who like maybe gets one a night is kind of what I would expect most people to do on simple QA. And that, you know, checks out, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，你就像是坐在问答之夜的那个，可能一晚上只答对一个问题的人，这就是我期望大多数人在Simple QA上的表现。而且，你知道，这说得通，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like obviously the models know a lot more than we do in terms of facts and just general, you know, information about the world. So at a minimum, you can say that GPT4.5 knows a lot more. You know, a bigger model is able to absorb a lot more facts.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 显然，模型在事实和关于世界的普遍信息方面比我们知道得多得多。所以至少可以说，GPT-4.5知道的更多。一个更大的模型能够吸收更多的知识。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Qualitatively, people also said in some ways maybe it's better for creative writing. you know, it was never really trained with the same uh power of post- training that GBD5 has had.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 从定性角度看，人们也说在某些方面它可能更适合创意写作。它从未真正接受过与GPT-5相同的**后训练**（Post-training: 在模型完成基础预训练后，通过特定任务或数据进行进一步优化和微调的过程）强度。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so, we don't really have an apples to apples comparison, but people still did still find some utility in it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，我们没有真正意义上的“同类比较”，但人们仍然从中发现了一些实用价值。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think maybe the the way to understand why they've taken that offline and gone all in on GBD5 is just that that model's really big. It's expensive to run. The price was like way higher. It was a full order of magnitude plus higher than GPT5 is.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想，理解他们为何将其下线并全力投入GPT-5的原因，可能只是因为那个模型实在太大了。运行成本高昂，价格远高于GPT-5，高出一个数量级甚至更多。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
and it's maybe just not worth it for them to consume all the compute that it would take to serve that and maybe they just find that people are happy enough with the somewhat smaller models for now.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且，对他们来说，消耗所有计算资源来提供这项服务可能不值得，也许他们只是发现人们目前对稍微小一点的模型已经足够满意了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I don't think that means that we will never see a bigger GPT 4.5 model with all that reasoning ability and I I would expect that that would deliver more value especially if you're really going out and trying to do esoteric stuff that's you know pushing the frontier of science or what have you.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我不认为这意味着我们永远不会看到一个拥有所有推理能力的更大规模的GPT-4.5模型，我预计它会带来更多价值，特别是如果你真的在尝试做一些推动科学前沿的深奥工作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but in the meantime, the current models are really smart and you can also feed them a lot of context. That's one of the big things that has improved so much over the last generation.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但是与此同时，目前的模型确实很智能，你也可以给它们提供大量的**上下文**（Context: 指模型在处理信息时所能考虑到的相关信息范围）。这是上一代模型以来改进非常大的一点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
When GPT4 came out, at least the version that we had as public users was only 8,000 tokens of context, which is like 15, you know, pages of of text. So, you were limited.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 当GPT-4发布时，至少我们作为公共用户使用的版本只有8000个**上下文令牌**（Context Tokens: 模型处理输入和输出文本的基本单位，决定了模型能“记住”的信息量），大约是15页文本。所以你受到了限制。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You couldn't even put in like a couple papers. You would be overflowing the context. And this is where prompt engineering initially kind of became a thing was like, man, I've really only got such a little bit of information that I can provide.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你甚至不能输入几篇论文，上下文就会溢出。这就是为什么**提示工程**（Prompt Engineering: 设计和优化输入提示，以引导AI模型生成更准确、有用和符合预期的输出）最初变得流行起来的原因，人们会想，天哪，我能提供的信息实在太少了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I got to be really careful about what information to provide, uh, lest I overflow the thing and it just can't handle it. There were also, as context windows got extended, there were also versions of models where they could nominally accept a lot more, but they couldn't really functionally use them.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我必须非常小心地选择提供哪些信息，以免信息溢出导致模型无法处理。随着上下文窗口的扩展，也有一些模型版本表面上可以接受更多的信息，但实际上它们无法有效利用这些信息。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
you know, they sort of could it could could fit them, you know, at the API call level, but they the models would lose recall or they they'd sort of unravel as they got into longer and longer context.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，它们在**API**（Application Programming Interface: 应用程序接口，允许不同软件之间进行通信和数据交换）调用层面可以容纳这些信息，但模型会失去召回能力，或者在处理越来越长的上下文时变得混乱。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Now you have obviously much longer context and the command of it is really really good. So you can take dozens of papers on the longest context windows with Gemini and it will not only accept them, but it will do pretty intensive reasoning over them and with really high fidelity to those inputs.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 现在，你显然拥有更长的上下文，而且对它的掌控能力也非常出色。因此，你可以将数十篇论文加载到**Gemini**（Gemini: Google DeepMind开发的多模态大型语言模型）最长的上下文窗口中，它不仅能接受这些内容，还能对其进行相当深入的推理，并且对这些输入保持极高的准确性。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So that skill I think does kind of substitute for the model knowing facts itself. You could say geez we let's try to train all these facts into the model. We're going to need you know a trillion or who knows five trillion however many trillion parameters to fit all these super longtail facts.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以我认为这项技能在某种程度上可以替代模型本身了解事实。你可以说，哎呀，我们尝试将所有这些事实训练到模型中。我们将需要一万亿，甚至五万亿，不知道多少万亿的**参数**（Parameters: 模型中可学习的变量，其数量决定了模型的规模和复杂性），才能适应所有这些超长尾的事实。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Or you could say, well, a smaller thing that's really good at working over provided context can if people take the time or you know go to the trouble of providing the necessary information, I can kind of access the same facts that way.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 或者你可以说，一个擅长处理所提供上下文的小型模型，如果人们花时间或麻烦提供必要的信息，我就可以通过这种方式获取相同的事实。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So you have a kind of do I want to push on this size and do I want to bake everything into the model or do I want to just try to get as much performance out of a smaller tighter model that I have? And it seems like they've gone that way.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以你面临一个选择：是想在模型大小上发力，将所有信息都内置到模型中，还是想从现有的小型、紧凑模型中榨取尽可能多的性能？他们似乎选择了后者。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And I I think basically just because they're seeing faster progress on that gradient, you know, in the same way that the models themselves are always kind of in the training process taking a little step toward improvement, you know, the the outer loop of the model architecture and the the nature of the training runs and where they're going to invest their compute is also kind of going that direction.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为这基本上是因为他们在这个方向上看到了更快的进展。你知道，就像模型本身在训练过程中总是在一点点地改进一样，模型架构的**外循环**（Outer Loop: 指模型开发和优化过程中的宏观决策和策略，如架构选择、训练数据管理等）以及训练运行的性质，以及他们将计算资源投入到何处，也都在朝这个方向发展。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And they're always looking at like, well, we could scale up over here and maybe get this kind of benefit a little bit or we could do more post-training here and get this kind of benefit.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们总是在考虑，我们可以在这里扩大规模，也许能获得一点这种好处；或者我们可以在这里进行更多的后训练，获得那种好处。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And it just seems like we're getting more benefit from the post-training and the reasoning paradigm than scaling. But I don't think either one is uh I I definitely don't think either one is is dead.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 看起来我们从后训练和推理范式中获得的收益比从规模化中更多。但我认为这两种方法都没有消亡，我绝对不认为它们中任何一种已经终结。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
We haven't seen yet what 4.5 with all that post- training would look like.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们还没有看到，如果GPT-4.5经过所有那些后训练会是什么样子。

### AI推理能力的飞跃

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. And and so I mean one of the things that you mentioned that that Cal um you know analysis missed was was that it way underestimated the value of of of of of extended reasoning, right? Um, and so what what would it mean to to fully sort of appreciate that?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 是的。所以，你提到Cal的分析遗漏的一点是，它大大低估了扩展推理的价值，对吧？那么，要充分理解这一点意味着什么呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, I mean, a big one from just the last few weeks was that we had an IMO gold medal with pure reasoning models uh with no access to tools from multiple companies.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我的意思是，最近几周的一个重大进展是，我们看到了多个公司的纯推理模型在没有工具访问权限的情况下，获得了**国际数学奥林匹克竞赛**（IMO: International Mathematical Olympiad，一项面向全球中学生的数学竞赛）金牌。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you know, that is night and day compared to what GPT4 could do with math, right? We And these things are really weird. Like it's nothing I say here should be uh intended to suggest that people won't be able to find weaknesses in the models.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，这与GPT-4在数学方面的能力相比，简直是天壤之别，对吧？而且这些东西真的很奇怪。我在这里说的任何话，都不应被理解为暗示人们无法在模型中找到弱点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I I still use a tic-tac-toe puzzle to this day where I take a picture of a tic-tac-toe board where some the one of the players has made a wrong move um that is not optimal and thus allows the other player to force a win and I ask the models if somebody can force a win from this position.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我至今仍在使用一个井字棋谜题：我拍下棋盘，其中一个玩家走错了棋，这不是最佳走法，因此让另一位玩家能够强制获胜。然后我问模型，从这个位置是否有人能强制获胜。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Only very recently, only the last generation of models are starting to get that right some of the time. Almost always before they were like tic-tac-toe is a solved game. You know, you can always get a draw.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 就在最近，只有上一代模型才开始有时能答对。以前几乎总是说井字棋是个已解决的游戏。你知道，你总能打成平局。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
there's and they would wrongly assess my board position as player can still get a draw. So, there's a lot of weird stuff, right? The the jagged uh capabilities frontier remains a real issue and people are going to find, you know, peaks and valleys for sure, but GPD4 when it first came out couldn't do anything approaching IMO gold problems.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们会错误地评估我的棋盘位置，认为玩家仍然可以打成平局。所以，有很多奇怪的事情，对吧？这种**参差不齐的能力边界**（Jagged Capabilities Frontier: 指AI模型在不同任务或领域表现出显著不一致的能力水平，有时非常出色，有时却表现不佳）仍然是一个真实的问题，人们肯定会发现其高峰和低谷。但GPT-4刚发布时，根本无法解决接近IMO金牌难度的问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It was still struggling on like high school math. And since then, we've seen this high school math progression all the way up through the IMO gold.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它甚至还在高中数学上苦苦挣扎。而从那时起，我们看到了这种高中数学的进步一直持续到IMO金牌水平。

Original English English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Now we've got the frontier math benchmark that is I think now like up to 25%. It was 2% about a year ago or even a little less than a year ago I think.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 现在我们有了前沿数学基准，我想现在已经达到了25%左右。大约一年前，甚至不到一年前，它还只有2%。

Original English English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And we also just today saw something where um and I haven't absorbed this one yet but somebody just came out and said that they had solved a you know canonical super challenging problem that no less than Terrence Ta had put out.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且就在今天，我们还看到了一件事——我还没完全消化这个消息——有人刚宣布他们解决了一个由Terence Tao（陶哲轩）提出的，一个众所周知且极具挑战性的经典问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um and it was like this you know this thing happened in I think days or weeks of the model running versus it was 18 months you know that it took professional and not just any professional mathematicians but like really you know the leading minds in the world to make progress on these problems.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且你知道，这件事发生在模型运行几天或几周之内，而之前，世界顶尖的专业数学家，而不是任何普通数学家，花了18个月才在这些问题上取得进展。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So yeah, I think that's really um you know that's that's really hard uh jumping capabilities to miss. I also think a lot about the Google AI co-scientist which we did an episode with.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以是的，我认为这些显著的跳跃式能力确实难以忽视。我还经常想到我们曾做过一期节目的**Google AI联席科学家项目**（Google AI Co-scientist: Google开发的一个AI系统，旨在协助科学家进行研究，包括生成假设、设计实验等）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
We can you can uh check out the full story on that if you want to. But you know they basically just broke down the scientific method into a schematic you know and this is a lot of what happens when people there's one thing to say the model will respond with thinking and it'll go through a reasoning process and you know the more tokens it it spends at runtime the better your answer will be.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果你想，可以查看关于它的完整故事。但你知道，他们基本上只是将**科学方法**（Scientific Method: 科学研究的基本框架，包括观察、提出假设、实验验证、分析结果和得出结论）分解成一个图示。当人们说模型会通过思考和推理过程给出回应时，这很重要，而且模型在运行时消耗的**令牌**（Tokens: 文本或代码的基本单位，用于衡量AI处理的信息量）越多，你的答案就会越好。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That's true. Then you can also build this scaffolding on top of that and say okay well let me take something as broad and you know aspirational as the scientific method and let me break that down into parts okay there's hypothesis generation then there's hypothesis evaluation then there's you know experiment design there's literature review there's all these parts to the scientific method what the team at Google did is created a pretty elaborate schematic that represented their best breakdown of the scientific method optimized prompts for each of those steps and then gave this resulting system which is scaling inference now kind of two ways.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这是真的。然后你还可以在此基础上搭建**脚手架**（Scaffolding: 在AI任务中，通过提供结构化步骤、中间反馈或分解复杂问题来辅助模型完成任务的技术），然后说，好吧，让我把科学方法这样宏大而富有抱负的东西分解成几个部分：有**假设生成**（Hypothesis Generation: 提出可检验的科学假设的过程），然后是**假设评估**（Hypothesis Evaluation: 检验和判断假设有效性的过程），然后是**实验设计**（Experiment Design: 规划和构建实验以验证假设的方法），还有**文献综述**（Literature Review: 对现有相关研究进行系统性回顾和分析），科学方法包含所有这些部分。Google团队所做的是创建了一个相当精密的图示，代表了他们对科学方法的最佳分解，并为每个步骤优化了提示，然后将这个由此产生的系统——现在以两种方式进行**扩展推理**（Scaling Inference: 指通过增加计算量或优化策略，使AI模型在处理复杂推理任务时能够更高效、更深入地进行思考和解决问题）——交付使用。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's both the chain of thought, but it's also all these different angles of attack structured by the team. And they gave it legitimately unsolved problems in science.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它既是**思维链**（Chain of Thought: 一种提示技术，通过让语言模型逐步展示其推理过程，从而提高其解决复杂问题的能力），也是团队结构化的所有这些不同的攻击角度。他们给它提供了科学领域中真正未解决的问题。

Original English English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And in one particularly famous kind of notorious case, it came up with a hypothesis which it wasn't able to verify because it doesn't have direct access to actually run the experiments in the lab.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 在一个特别著名且有些臭名昭著的案例中，它提出了一个假设，但由于它无法直接在实验室中进行实验验证，因此无法证实该假设。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But it came up with a hypothesis to some open problem in viology that had stumped scientists for years and it just so happened that they had also recently figured out the answer but not yet published their results and so there was this confluence where the scientists had experimentally verified and Gemini uh in the form of this AI co-scientist came up with exactly the right answer and these are things that like literally nobody knew before and GP GPD4 just wasn't doing that you know I mean these uh qualitatively new capabilities.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但它为一个多年来困扰科学家的病毒学开放问题提出了一个假设，碰巧科学家们也刚刚找到了答案但尚未发表结果。因此，出现了一种巧合：科学家们通过实验验证，而Gemini，以AI联席科学家的形式，得出了完全正确的答案。这些都是以前没有人知道的事情，GPT-4根本做不到。我的意思是，这些是本质上全新的能力。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That thing I think ran for days. You know, it probably cost hundreds of dollars, maybe into the thousands of dollars to run the inference. Um you know, that's not nothing, but it's also like very much cheaper than, you know, years of grad students.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想那个系统运行了好几天。你知道，运行**推理**（Inference: 指AI模型在接收到新的输入数据后，利用已学习到的模式和知识进行预测或生成输出的过程）可能花费了几百甚至几千美元。嗯，这不算少，但它也比聘用研究生多年的成本便宜得多。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And if you can get to those caliber of problems and actually get good solutions to them, like, you know, what would you be willing to pay, right, for that kind of thing?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果你能解决这类高难度问题并获得好的解决方案，那么，你知道，你愿意为这种东西支付多少钱呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, yeah, I don't know. That's probably not a full appreciation. We could go on for a long time, but I would say in in summary, GBT4 was not able to push the actual frontier of human knowledge.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，是的，我不知道。这可能还不是完全的理解。我们可以谈很久，但总而言之，GPT-4无法推动人类知识的真正前沿。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I don't to my knowledge, I don't know that ever discovered anything new. It's still not easy to get that kind of output from a GPT5 or a Gemini 2.5 or, you know, a Claude Opus 4, whatever, but it's starting to happen sometimes.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 据我所知，它从未发现任何新事物。从GPT-5、Gemini 2.5或Claude Opus 4等模型中获得这类输出仍然不容易，但它有时已经开始发生了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that in and of itself is a a huge deal. Well, then how do we explain the the the the bearishness or or the kind of vibe shift around GBD5?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这本身就是一件大事。那么，我们如何解释围绕GPT-5的这种悲观情绪或氛围转变呢？

### GPT-5的误解与实际进展

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Then you know one one potential contributor is this idea that if a lot of the if if the improvements are at the frontier, you know, not everyone is working with you know, sort of advanced math and physics and in a day-to-day and so maybe they don't see the benefits in their day-to-day lives in in the same way that, you know, sort of the jumps in chat GBT were were were obvious and and shaped the day-to-day.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 那么，一个可能的因素是，如果大部分改进都集中在技术前沿，那么并不是每个人日常都在处理高级数学和物理问题，所以他们可能无法像ChatGPT的飞跃那样，在日常生活中明显感受到这些好处，并因此改变他们的日常生活。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. I mean, I think a decent amount of it was that they kind of up the launch, you know, simply put, right? They like were tweeting Death Star images, uh, which Sam Alman later came back and said, "No, you're the Death Star. I'm not the Death Star."

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是的。我的意思是，我认为很大一部分原因在于他们有点夸大了发布，简单来说，对吧？他们发布了“死星”图片，而Sam Altman后来又回来澄清说：“不，你们才是死星，我不是死星。”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But, uh, I think people thought that the Death Star was supposed to be the model. That was generally the, you know, the expectations were set extremely high.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但是，我认为人们普遍认为“死星”指的就是模型本身。总的来说，期望被设定得非常高。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The actual launch itself was just technically broken. So a lot of people's first experiences of GBT5, they've got this model router concept now where and I think one another way to understand what they're doing here is they're trying to own the consumer use case and to own that they need to simplify the product experience relative to what we had in the past which was like okay you got GBT4 and 40 and 40 mini and 03 and 04 mini and other things you know 45 was in there at one point you got all these different models which one should I use for which?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 实际发布本身在技术上就出了问题。因此，很多人对GPT-5的首次体验并不好。他们现在有了**模型路由器**（Model Router: 一种AI系统，根据用户查询的类型和难度，自动将请求路由到最适合处理该请求的特定AI模型）的概念，我认为理解他们这样做的另一个角度是，他们试图主导消费者用例。要做到这一点，他们需要简化产品体验，而不是像过去那样，你有很多不同的模型，比如GPT-4、GPT-4.0、GPT-4.0 Mini、GPT-4.03、GPT-4.04 Mini等等，甚至GPT-4.5也曾出现过，这么多模型，我该用哪个来解决哪个问题？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's like very confusing to most people who aren't obsessed with this. And so, one of the big things they wanted to do was just shrink that down to just ask your question and you'll get a good answer and we'll take that complexity on our side as the the product owners to do that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这对于大多数不痴迷于此的人来说非常困惑。所以，他们想做的一件大事就是将其简化为：你只需提出问题，就会得到一个好的答案，而我们将作为产品所有者来承担这种复杂性。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Interestingly, and I don't have a great account of this, but one thing you you might want to do is kind of merge the models and figure out just have the model itself decide how much to think or maybe even, you know, have the model itself decide how many of its experts. If it's a mixture of experts, architecture it needs to use or maybe, you know, there's been a bunch of different uh research projects on like skipping layers of the model.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 有趣的是，我对此没有很好的解释，但你可能想做的一件事是合并模型，让模型自己决定思考多少，甚至让模型自己决定需要使用多少个专家（如果它是一个**专家混合架构**（Mixture of Experts Architecture: 一种神经网络架构，其中包含多个专家子网络，针对不同任务或数据进行专门化处理））。或者，你知道，有很多不同的研究项目致力于跳过模型的某些层。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
If the task is easy enough, you could like skip a bunch of layers. So you might have hoped that you could genuinely on the back end merge all these different models into one model that would dynamically use the right amount of compute for the level of challenge that a given user query presented.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果任务足够简单，你可以跳过很多层。所以你可能曾希望，在后端可以真正地将所有这些不同的模型合并成一个模型，该模型能够根据给定用户查询的挑战程度，动态地使用适量的计算资源。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It seems like they found that harder to do than they expected. And so the solution that they came up with instead was to have a router where the the router's job is to pick is this an easy query in which case we'll send you to this model.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 看起来他们发现这比预期的更难实现。所以他们提出的解决方案是使用一个路由器，路由器的任务是选择：这是一个简单的查询吗？如果是，我们就把你发送到这个模型。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Is it a medium? Is it a hard? And I think they just have two really u models behind the scenes. So I think it's just really easy or hard. Certainly the graphs that they showed, you know, basically showed the kind of with and without thinking.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是中等难度吗？是高难度吗？我想他们幕后只有两种模型。所以我认为只有“非常简单”或“非常困难”两种。当然，他们展示的图表基本上显示了有思考和无思考两种情况。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um the problem at launch was that that router was broken. So all all of the queries were going to the dumb model and so a lot of people literally just got bad outputs which were worse than 03 because they were getting non-thinking responses.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 发布时的问题是那个路由器坏了。所以所有的查询都发送到了“笨”模型，因此很多人得到的输出很糟糕，甚至比GPT-4.03还要差，因为他们得到了未经思考的回复。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so the initial reaction of like okay this is dumb and that sort of you know uh traveled really fast. I think that kind of set the tone.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以最初的反应是“这太蠢了”，这种想法传播得非常快。我认为这奠定了基调。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
My sense now is that as the dust has settled most people do think that it is the best model available and you know things like the meter the infamous uh meter task length chart. It is the best.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我现在的感觉是，尘埃落定之后，大多数人确实认为它是目前最好的模型，而且像Meter那个臭名昭著的“任务长度图表”之类的东西也显示，它是最好的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know we're now over two hours and um it is still above the trend line. So if you just said, you know, do I believe in straight lines on graphs or not?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，我们现在已经超过两个小时了，而且它仍然在趋势线上方。所以如果你只是说，你相信图表上的直线吗？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And how should this latest data point influence whether I believe on these straight line straight um lines on, you know, power um logarithmic scale graphs.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这个最新的数据点应该如何影响我是否相信这些在对数尺度图表上的直线呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It shouldn't really change your mind too much. It's still above the trend line. I talked to ZV about this. Zim Mashwitz uh legendary infovore and uh AI industry analyst on a recent podcast too and kind of asked him the same question like why do you think the you know even some of the most plugged in you know sharp uh minds in the space have seemingly pushed timelines out a bit as a result of this and his answer was basically just it resolved some amount of uncertainty you know you had a open question of maybe they do have another breakthrough you know maybe it really is the Death Star um you know if they surprise surprise us on the upside than all these short timelines, you know, we we could have expected a um yeah, I guess one one way to think about it is like the the distribution was sort of broad in terms of timelines and if they had surprised on the upside, it might have narrowed and narrowed in toward the front end of the distribution and if it if they surprised on the downside or even just were, you know, purely on trend, then you would take some of your distribution from the very short end of the timelines and kind of push them back toward the middle or the end.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它不应该改变你太多想法。它仍然在趋势线上方。我最近也和ZV（Zim Mashwitz），一位传奇的信息狂人和AI行业分析师在播客上聊过这个。我问了他同样的问题：你认为为什么即使是这个领域里一些最消息灵通、最敏锐的人才，似乎也因此推迟了时间线？他的回答基本上是，这解决了一定程度的不确定性。你知道，你曾有一个悬而未决的问题，就是他们是否会有另一个突破，也许它真的是“死星”。你知道，如果他们出乎意料地表现出色，那么所有这些短期时间线，我们本可以预期到……是的，我想一种思考方式是，时间线的分布是比较宽泛的。如果他们表现出色，时间线可能会收窄并向分布的前端靠拢；如果他们表现不佳，甚至只是完全符合趋势，那么你就会把时间线分布中非常短的那一部分推回到中间或末端。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so his answer was like AI 2027 seems less likely, but AI 2030 seems basically no less likely, maybe even a little more likely because some of the the probability mass from the early years is now sitting there.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以他的回答是，AI在2027年出现的可能性似乎降低了，但2030年出现的可能性基本没有减少，甚至可能略有增加，因为早期年份的一些概率质量现在在那里。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So it's not that um I don't think people are are moving the whole distribution out super much. I think there may be more just kind of shrinking the uh you know it's getting a little tighter because it's maybe not happening quite as soon as it seemed like it might have been.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以并不是说人们将整个分布大幅度地向后推移。我认为更多的是时间线在收紧，因为它可能不会像之前看起来那样快地发生。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Uh but I don't think too many people at least that I you know think are really plugged in on this are pushing out too much past 2030 at all.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我认为，至少在我看来，真正关注此事的很多人，并没有将时间线推迟到2030年以后。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And by the way you know they obviously there's a lot of um you know disagreement. The way I kind of have always thought about this sort of stuff is Daario says 2027 Demis says 2030. I'll take that as my range.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 顺便说一下，你知道，他们显然有很多分歧。我一直以来对这类事情的看法是，Dario说2027年，Demis说2030年。我把这个作为我的预测范围。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So coming into GBT5, I was kind of in that space. And now I'd say, well, I don't know, Dario's got uh what what cars does he have up his sleeve?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以在GPT-5发布之前，我大概就是这个想法。现在我会说，嗯，我不知道，Dario还有什么后手呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, they just put out 4.1 Opus. And in that blog post, they said we will be releasing more powerful updates to our models in the coming weeks, so they're due for something pretty soon.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，他们刚刚发布了**Claude Opus 4.1**（Claude Opus 4.1: Anthropic公司开发的一款高级大型语言模型）。在那篇博客文章中，他们表示将在未来几周内发布更强大的模型更新，所以他们很快就会有新动作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, maybe they'll be the ones to surprise on the upside this time, or maybe Google will be. Um, I wouldn't say 2027 is is out of the question, but yeah, I would say 20 2030 still looks just as likely as before.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，也许这次会是他们带来惊喜，或者Google会。嗯，我不会说2027年不可能，但是的，我认为2030年仍然和以前一样有可能。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And again, from my standpoint, it's like that's still really soon, you know? So, if we're on track, whether it's 28, 29, 30, uh, I don't really care.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 再说一次，从我的角度来看，那仍然是非常近的未来，你知道吗？所以，如果我们在正轨上，无论是2028、2029还是2030年，我都不太在意。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I I I try to frame my own work so that I'm kind of preparing myself and helping other people prepare for what might be the most extreme scenarios and kind of, you know, one of these things where if we aim high and we miss a little bit and we have a little more time, great.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我努力规划自己的工作，以便为最极端的情况做好准备，并帮助其他人也做好准备。你知道，这就像是，如果我们目标定得很高，即使稍微偏离了一点，多了一些时间，那也很好。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I'm sure we'll have plenty of things to do to use that extra time to be ready for, you know, whatever powerful AI does come online.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我相信我们会有很多事情可以做，利用这些额外时间来为任何即将出现的强大AI做好准备。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but yeah, I guess I don't uh my worldview hasn't changed all that much as a result of these uh summer's developments.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但是，是的，我想我的世界观并没有因为这个夏天发生的事情而改变太多。

### AI对生产力的影响：Meter论文的解读

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Anecdotally, I I don't hear as much about AI 2027 or situational awareness to the to the same degree. I I do talk to some people who've just moved it a few years back to to your point.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 从传闻来看，我不再像以前那样频繁听到关于“AI 2027”或**情境感知**（Situational Awareness: 指AI模型理解当前环境、任务和自身状态的能力）的讨论了。我确实和一些人聊过，他们只是把时间点往后推了几年，正如你所说。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um uh but um yeah, Dores Cesh had his whole thing around, you know, he still still believes in it, but sort of um you know, maybe because this gap gap in continual learning or or something to the effect that um you know, maybe it's just going to be a bit slower to to diffuse um and um you know, Meter's paper as you mentioned showed that uh engineers are less productive and so maybe there's there's less of a uh sort of concern around um you know, people being replaced in the next next few years in in in in mass.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 嗯，但是，是的，Dores Cesh的整个论点围绕着，你知道，他仍然相信它，但有点像，也许是因为持续学习中的这种空白，或者说，它可能扩散得会慢一些，而且，你知道，你提到的Meter的论文显示，工程师的生产力下降了，所以也许人们对未来几年大规模失业的担忧有所减少。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think when we spoke maybe a year ago about this or I think you said something like 50% of 50% of jobs. Um I'm curious if that's still your your uh your litmus test or how you think about it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 我记得大约一年前我们谈到这个话题时，你似乎说过50%的50%的工作。嗯，我很好奇这是否仍然是你的**试金石**（Litmus Test: 指一个决定性的检验标准或指标），或者你是如何看待这个问题的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, for one thing, I think that Meter paper is worth unpacking a little bit more because this was one of those things that was and I I I'm a big fan of Meter and I have no um you know, no shade on them because I do think do science, publish your results.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，首先，我认为Meter的论文值得再深入探讨一下，因为这是其中一个问题。我是Meter的忠实粉丝，我并不批评他们，因为我确实认为他们做科学研究，发表结果，这很好。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like that's good. You don't have to uh make every experimental result and everything you put out conform to a narrative. But I do think it was a little bit um it was a little bit too easy for people who wanted to say that oh this is all nonsense to latch on to that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这很好。你不必让每一个实验结果和你发布的一切都符合某个叙事。但我确实认为，对于那些想说“这都是胡说八道”的人来说，抓住这一点有点太容易了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you know again there is there's something there that I would kind of put in the Cal Newport category too where for me maybe the most interesting thing was the users thought that they were faster when in fact they seem to be slower.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且，你知道，这里面有一些东西，我也会把它归到Cal Newport的范畴里。对我来说，最有趣的一点可能是用户认为他们更快，而实际上他们似乎更慢。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So that sort of misperception of oneself I think is really interesting. Personally I think there's some explanations for that that include like hitting go on the agent going to social media and scrolling around for a while and then coming back.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以这种对自我的误解，我认为非常有趣。我个人认为对此有一些解释，包括比如启动**AI代理**（AI Agent: 能够感知环境、做出决策并执行行动以达成特定目标的AI程序）后，去刷社交媒体一段时间，然后再回来。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The thing might have been done for quite a while by the time I get back. So honestly one like really simple and we're starting to see this in products. One really simple thing that the products can do to address those concerns is just provide notifications like the thing is done now.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 等我回来的时候，事情可能已经完成很久了。所以老实说，一个非常简单的解决方案——我们已经开始在产品中看到这一点——产品可以做的就是提供通知，比如“事情已经完成”。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, you know, stop scrolling and and come back and check its work. That in terms of just clock time, you know, it would be interesting to know like what applications did they have open.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，停止滚动，回来检查它的工作。就实际时间而言，你知道，了解他们打开了哪些应用程序会很有趣。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Maybe they took a little longer with cursor than doing it on their own, but how much of the time was cursor the active window and how much of it was, you know, some other random distraction while they were waiting.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 也许他们在用Cursor（一款AI编程助手）时比自己做花的时间稍长，但其中有多少时间是Cursor作为活动窗口，又有多少时间是他们在等待时被其他随机事物分散了注意力。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um but I think a more fundamental issue with that study which again wasn't really about the study design but just in in the sort of you know interpretation and kind of digestion of it some of these details got lost.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我认为那项研究有一个更根本的问题，这与研究设计本身无关，而是在于对其的解读和消化过程中，一些细节被忽略了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The they basically tested the models or the you know the product cursor in the area where it was known to be least able to help.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们基本上是在Cursor已知帮助最少的领域测试这些模型或产品。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
This study was done early this year. So it was done with you know kind of one depending on how you want to count right a couple couple releases ago with code bases that are large which again strains the strains the context window and you know that's one of the the frontiers that has been moving very mature code bases with like high standards for coding and developers who really know their code bases super well who've made a lot of commit you know commits to these particular code bases.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这项研究是在今年早些时候进行的。所以它是在，你知道，大概是一两次发布之前，用大型代码库完成的，这再次考验了上下文窗口。你知道，这是正在发展的前沿领域之一：非常成熟的代码库，具有高标准的编码要求，以及那些非常了解自己代码库、对这些特定代码库做出大量提交的开发者。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So I would say that's basically the hardest situation that you could set up for an AI because the people know you know their stuff really well.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以我会说，这基本上是你能为AI设置的最困难的情况，因为人们对自己的工作非常了解。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The AI doesn't the context is huge. People have already absorbed that through working on it for a long time. The AI doesn't have that uh that knowledge and again couple generations ago models.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: AI不了解，上下文又非常庞大。人们通过长期工作已经吸收了这些知识。AI没有那种知识，而且这还是几代之前的模型。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um and then a big thing too is that the user the people were not very wellversed in the tools. Why? Because the tools weren't really able to help them yet.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，另外一个大问题是，用户对这些工具并不精通。为什么？因为这些工具当时还不能真正帮助他们。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think the sort of mindset of the people that came into the study in many cases was like, well, I haven't used this all that much because it hasn't really seemed to be super helpful. They weren't wrong in that assessment given the, you know, the limitations.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为，在很多情况下，参与研究的人的心态是：“嗯，我没怎么用过这个，因为它看起来并不是特别有用。”考虑到当时的局限性，他们的评估并没有错。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you could see that in terms of the um some of the instructions and the help that the meter team gave to people. One of the things that is in the paper that they would if they noticed that you weren't like weren't using cursor super well, they would give you some feedback on how to use it better.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你可以从Meter团队给人们的一些说明和帮助中看到这一点。论文中提到的一点是，如果他们发现你没有很好地使用Cursor，他们会给你一些关于如何更好地使用它的反馈。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
One of the things that they were telling people to do is make sure you at tag a particular file to bring that into context for the model so that the model has you know the right context.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们告诉人们要做的一件事是，确保你**@**标记一个特定的文件，将其带入模型的上下文，以便模型获得正确的上下文。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that's literally like the most basic thing that you would do in cursor you know that's like the thing you would learn on your in your first hour your first day of using it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而这实际上是你在Cursor中最基本的做法，你知道，这就像你使用它的第一个小时、第一天就会学到的东西。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So it really does suggest that these were you know while very capable programmers like basically mostly noviceses when it came to using the AI tools. So I think the result is real.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以这确实表明，这些人虽然是非常有能力的程序员，但在使用AI工具方面基本上都是新手。所以，我认为这个结果是真实的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um but I just I would be very cautious about generalizing too much there in terms of I guess what else was the other question.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但我只是对在那里过度概括会非常谨慎，就我猜另一个问题是什么而言。

### AI对就业的影响及软件开发的弹性

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's what is the expectation for jobs? I mean we're starting to see some of this right. We are definitely seeing no less than like Mark Banoff has said that they've, you know, have been able to cut a bunch of headcount because they've got AI agents now that are responding to every lead.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那么，对就业的预期是什么？我的意思是，我们现在开始看到一些迹象。我们确实看到，Mark Benoff这样的人已经说过，他们已经裁减了大量员工，因为他们现在有了能响应每个销售线索的AI代理。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, Clara of course is, you know, has said, um, you know, very similar things for a while now. They also, I think, have been a little bit misreported in terms of like, oh, they're backtracking off of that because they're actually going to keep some customer service people, not none.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，Clara当然也有一段时间一直在说类似的话。我认为关于他们的一些报道也有点失实，比如“哦，他们正在撤回之前的说法，因为他们实际上会保留一些客服人员，而不是全部取消。”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And I think that's a bit of an overreaction. like they may have some people who are just, you know, insistent on having a certain experience and maybe they want to provide that and that makes sense.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为这有点反应过度。比如他们可能有一些人坚持要获得某种特定的体验，也许他们想提供这种体验，这也很合理。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, it doesn't I think you can have a a a spectrum of service offerings to your customers. I once coded up a pricing page for a I actually just vibe coded up a pricing page for a SAS company that was like basic uh level with AI sales and service is one price.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，我认为你可以为客户提供一系列的服务。我曾经为一个**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务，一种通过互联网提供软件的模式）公司编写过一个定价页面，我实际上是凭感觉编写的，它将基础级别的AI销售和服务定为一个价格。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
If you want to talk to human sales, that's a higher price. And if you want to talk to human sales and support, that's a, you know, third higher price.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果你想和人工销售交谈，价格会更高。如果你想和人工销售和支持人员交谈，那价格会再高一截。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so, like, literally, that might be what's going on, I think, in some of these cases. And it it could very well be a very sensible option for people.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，我的意思是，在某些情况下，这可能就是实际情况。对人们来说，这很可能是一个非常明智的选择。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I just I do see the intercom. I've got an episode coming up with, they now have this Finn agent that is solving like 65% of customer service tickets that come in.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我确实看到了**Intercom**（Intercom: 一款客户消息平台）的情况。我即将与他们合作制作一期节目，他们现在有一个名为Finn的代理，能够解决大约65%的客户服务工单。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, you know, what's that going to do to jobs? Are there really like three times as many customer service tickets to be handled? Like, I don't know.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，这对就业会产生什么影响？真的会有三倍多的客服工单需要处理吗？我不知道。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think there's kind of a relatively inelastic supply. Maybe you'll get somewhat more tickets if people expect that they're going to get better, faster answers, but I don't think we're going to see like three times more tickets.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为这有点像相对缺乏弹性的供给。如果人们期望得到更好、更快的答案，工单可能会稍微增加一些，但我不认为我们会看到三倍多的工单。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
By the way, that number was like 55% 3 or four months ago. So, you know, as they ratchet that up, the ratios get really hard, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 顺便说一下，这个数字在三四个月前大约是55%。所以，你知道，随着他们不断提高这个比例，情况会变得非常棘手，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
At half ticket resolution, in theory, maybe you get some more tickets. Maybe you don't need to adjust headcount too much. But when you get to 90% ticket resolution, you know, are you really going to have 10 times as many tickets or 10 times as many hard tickets that the people have to handle?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 在解决一半工单的情况下，理论上，你可能会得到更多的工单。也许你不需要大幅调整员工数量。但是当你达到90%的工单解决率时，你知道，你真的会有10倍的工单，或者10倍的困难工单需要人工处理吗？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It seems just really hard to imagine that. So I don't think I don't think these things go to zero probably in a lot of environments but I do expect that you will see significant headcount reduction in a lot of these places and the software one is really interesting because the elasticities are really unknown.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这真的很难想象。所以我不认为这些事情在很多环境中会变成零，但我确实预计在很多地方你会看到显著的人员削减，而软件行业的情况非常有趣，因为其弹性是未知的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
you know, you can potentially produce x times more software per user or, you know, per per cursor user or per developer at your company, whatever.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，你有可能为每个用户，或者说为每个Cursor用户，或者为公司里的每个开发者，生产X倍的软件，诸如此类。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But maybe you want that. You know, maybe there is no limit or no, you know, maybe the the regime that we're in is such that if there's, you know, 10 times more productivity, that's all to the good.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但也许你就是想要这样。你知道，也许没有限制，或者说，我们所处的这个时代，如果生产力提高了10倍，那完全是好事。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And, you know, we still have just as many uh jobs because we want 10 times more software. I don't know how long that lasts.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且，你知道，我们仍然有同样多的工作岗位，因为我们想要10倍的软件。我不知道这种情况能持续多久。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
again the ratios start to get challenging at some point. Um but yeah, I think the bottle, you know, the old Tyler Common thing comes to mind. You are a bottleneck. You are a bottleneck.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 再次强调，在某个时候，这些比例会变得具有挑战性。嗯，但是，是的，我想起了Tyler Cowen老生常谈的一句话：你是一个瓶颈。你是一个瓶颈。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um I think more often it is are people really trying to get the most out of these things and you know are they using best practices and have they um have they really put their minds to it or not?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我认为更多时候的问题是，人们是否真的在努力最大限度地利用这些东西，他们是否在使用最佳实践，他们是否真正用心去做了？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I you know often the the real barrier is there. I was I've been working a little bit with a company that is doing um basically government doc review.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我觉得真正的障碍常常就在那里。我曾与一家公司合作，他们主要负责政府文件的审查工作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I'll abstract a little bit away from the details, really gnarly stuff like scanned documents, you know, handwritten uh filling out of forms.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我会稍微抽象地描述一下细节，比如扫描文件、手写填表之类的非常棘手的工作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
and they've created this auditor AI agent that just won a state level contract to do the audits on like a million transactions a year of of these um you know these packets of documents again scanned, handwritten, all this kind of crap.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们创建了一个审计AI代理，刚刚赢得了一项州级合同，每年对大约一百万笔交易进行审计，这些交易涉及的文档包再次是扫描件、手写件，诸如此类的东西。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um and they just blew away the human uh workers that were doing the job before. So where are those workers going to go?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，他们刚刚彻底超越了以前从事这项工作的人工。那么那些工人将何去何从呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like I don't know. I don't they're not going to have 10 times as many transactions. you know, I can be pretty confident in that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我不知道。他们不会有10倍的交易量。对此我相当有信心。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, are there going to be a few still that are there to supervise the AIS and handle the weird cases and, you know, answer the phones? Sure.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，是否还会有少数人留下来监督AI、处理异常情况，以及接听电话？当然。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, maybe they maybe they won't go anywhere. You know, this the state, you know, the state may do a strange thing and uh just have all those people like sit around because they can't bear to fire them.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，也许他们不会去任何地方。你知道，这个州，可能会做出一些奇怪的事情，只是让所有那些人闲坐着，因为他们不忍心解雇他们。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like, who knows what the ultimate decision will be. But I do see a lot of these things where I'm just like when you really put your mind to it and you identify what would create real leverage for us, can the AI do that?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 谁知道最终的决定会是什么。但我确实看到了很多这样的情况，就是当你真正投入思考，并确定什么能为我们创造真正的杠杆时，AI能做到吗？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Can we make it work? You can take a pretty large chunk out of high volume tasks uh very reliably in today's world.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们能让它运转起来吗？在当今世界，你可以非常可靠地从高工作量的任务中削减相当大一部分。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so the the impacts I think are starting to be seen there on on a lot of jobs. Humans I think are you know the leadership is maybe the bottleneck or the the will in in a lot of places might be the bottleneck and software might be an interesting case where there is just so much pent-up demand perhaps that it might take a little longer to see those impacts because you really do want you know 10 or 100 times as much software.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 因此，我认为AI对许多工作的影响已经开始显现。我认为人类，或者说领导力，可能是瓶颈，或者说在很多地方，意愿可能是瓶颈。而软件可能是一个有趣的案例，也许存在如此多的积压需求，以至于看到这些影响可能需要更长的时间，因为你确实想要10倍甚至100倍的软件。

### 代码生成与递归自我改进

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
What is Yeah, let's let's talk about code because it's, you know, it's it's where Andropic made made a big bet um early on, you know, perhaps inspired by the sort of automated researcher, you know, recursive self-improvement um you know, sort of you, you know, desired future and and we saw open AI uh make make moves um there as well.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 是的，我们来谈谈代码吧，因为它，你知道，是Anthropic公司早期投入重金的领域，也许是受到自动化研究员、递归自我改进等未来愿景的启发。我们看到OpenAI也在这个领域有所动作。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Why don't we flush that out or talk a little about you know what what inspired that and where you see that going?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 我们来深入探讨一下，或者谈谈是什么启发了这一点，以及你认为它会走向何方？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, utopia or dystopia is really the big question there, I think. Right. Right. I mean is maybe one part technical, two parts social in terms of why code has been so focal.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，我认为那里真正的核心问题是乌托邦还是反乌托邦。是的。是的。我的意思是，代码之所以如此受关注，可能有一部分是技术原因，两部分是社会原因。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The technical part is that it's really easy to validate code. You generate it, you can run it. If you get a runtime error, you can get the feedback immediately.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 技术部分是，代码非常容易验证。你生成它，就可以运行它。如果出现运行时错误，你可以立即得到反馈。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's, you know, somewhat harder to do functional testing. Replet recently just in the last like 48 hours released their V3 of their agent and it now in addition to you know code code code try to make your app work v2 of the agent would do that and it could go for minutes and you know in some cases generate dozens of files and I've had some magical experiences with that where I was like wow you just did that whole thing in one prompt and it like worked amazing.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，进行功能测试稍微困难一些。**Replit**（Replit: 一个在线编程平台和开发环境）最近在过去48小时内发布了其代理的V3版本，它现在除了代码生成外（代理的V2版本会尝试让你的应用程序运行，这可能持续几分钟，有时会生成几十个文件），我曾有过一些神奇的体验，当时我心想：哇，你只用一个提示就完成了所有事情，而且效果惊人。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Other times it will sort of code for a while and hand it off to you and say okay does it look good? Is it working? and you're like, "No, it's not. I'm not sure why."

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 其他时候，它会编写一段时间代码，然后交给你，问：“看起来不错吗？能运行吗？”而你会说：“不，不能。我不知道为什么。”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, you get into a a back and forth with it. But the difference between V2 and V3 is that instead of handing the baton back to you, it now uses a browser and the vision aspect of the models to go try to do the QA itself.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，你就会和它来回交流。但V2和V3的区别在于，V3不再将接力棒交还给你，而是利用浏览器和模型的视觉功能，自行进行**质量保证**（QA: Quality Assurance，即质量保证）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, it doesn't just say, "Okay, hey, I uh I tried my best, wrote a bunch of code, like let me know if it's working or not." It takes that first pass at figuring out if it's working.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以它不会只说：“好吧，我尽力了，写了一堆代码，告诉我它是否能运行。”它会自己先尝试找出是否能运行。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you know again that that really improves the flywheel just how much you can do, how much you can validate, how quickly you can validate it. The the speed of that loop is really key to the pace of improvement.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，这确实大大提升了**飞轮效应**（Flywheel Effect: 指一个良性循环，其中每一环节的成功都会推动下一环节，从而加速整体增长），即你能做多少，能验证多少，以及验证的速度有多快。那个循环的速度对于改进的步伐至关重要。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So it's a problem space that's pretty amendable to the sorts of, you know, rapid flywheel techniques. Second, of course, they they're all coders right at these places.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以这是一个非常适合快速飞轮技术的问题领域。其次，当然，这些地方的人都是程序员。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So they want to, you know, solve their own problems. That's like very natural. And third, I do think on the, you know, sort of social vision competition, uh, who knows where this is all going, they do want to create the automated AI researcher.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以他们想要解决自己的问题。这很自然。第三，我认为在社会愿景竞争方面，谁知道这一切将走向何方，他们确实想要创建自动化的AI研究员。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That's another data point, by the way, from this was from the 03 system card. They showed a jump from like low to mid single digits to roughly 40% of PRs actually checked in by research engineers at OpenAI that the model could do.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 顺便说一下，这还有另一个数据点，来自GPT-4.03的系统卡片。他们展示了OpenAI研究工程师实际提交的**拉取请求**（PR: Pull Request，在软件开发中，开发者提议将代码更改合并到主代码库的一种方式）中，模型能够完成的比例从低到中个位数跃升到大约40%。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So prior to 03 not much at all you know low to mid single digits as of 03 40%. I'm sure those are the easier 40% or whatever.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以在GPT-4.03之前，模型能做的很少，只有低到中个位数，而到GPT-4.03，这个比例达到了40%。我敢肯定这些是比较容易的40%，或者诸如此类。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Again, there will be, you know, caveats to that, but that's you're entering maybe the steep part of the S-curve there.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 同样，这会有一些限制条件，但你可能正进入**S曲线**（S-curve: 一种表示技术或产品生命周期发展趋势的曲线，初期缓慢，中期快速增长，后期趋于平稳）的陡峭部分。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that's presumably pretty high-end. You know, I don't know how many easy problems they have at OpenAI, but presumably, you know, not that many relative to the rest of us that are out here making uh generic web apps all the time.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这大概是相当高端的。你知道，我不知道OpenAI有多少简单问题，但想必，相对于我们这些整天都在制作通用网络应用的人来说，他们没有那么多简单问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, you know, at 40% you got to be starting to, I would think, get into some pretty hard tasks, some pretty high value stuff, you know, at that at what point does that ratio really start to tip where the AI is like doing the bulk of the work?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，达到40%时，我想你必须开始处理一些相当困难的任务，一些非常有价值的工作，你知道，在哪个点上，这个比例会真正倾斜，AI开始承担大部分工作呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, GBD5 notably wasn't a big update over 03 on that particular measure. I mean it also wasn't going back to the simple QA thing.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，值得注意的是，GPT-5在那个特定指标上并没有比GPT-4.03有大的更新。我的意思是，它也没有回到Simple QA的问题上。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um GP5 is generally understood to not be a scale up relative to 40 and 03 and you can see that in the simple QA measure. It basically scores the same on these longtail trivia questions.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，GPT-5通常被认为相对于GPT-4.0和GPT-4.03而言，在规模上没有显著提升，这可以从Simple QA的衡量中看出。它在这些长尾琐事问题上的得分基本相同。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's not a bigger model that has absorbed like lots more world knowledge. Um it is it is you know Cal is right. I think it is is analysis that it's it's post-training.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它不是一个吸收了更多世界知识的更大模型。嗯，它是，你知道，Cal是对的。我认为他的分析是，它侧重于后训练。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um but that post training you know is potentially entering the steep part of the S-curve when it comes to the ability to do even the kind of hard problems that are happening at uh at OpenAI on the research engineering front.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但这种后训练，你知道，在解决OpenAI研究工程领域那些难题的能力方面，有可能正进入S曲线的陡峭部分。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you know, yikes. I I'm a little worried about that, honestly. The um the idea that we could go from these companies having a few hundred research engineer people to having, you know, unlimited overnight and like what would that mean in terms of how much things could change and also just our ability to steer that overall process.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 而且，你知道，天哪。老实说，我对此有点担心。这些公司可能从拥有几百名研究工程师，一夜之间变成拥有无限数量的工程师，这意味着什么？事情会改变多少？以及我们引导整个过程的能力又如何？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, I'm not super comfortable with the idea of the companies tipping into a **recursive self-improvement** regime, especially given the the level of control and the level of unpredictability that we currently see in the models.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我不太习惯公司进入**递归自我改进**（Recursive Self-improvement: 指AI系统能够自主地改进自身性能和能力，从而实现指数级增长）模式，特别是考虑到我们目前在模型中看到的控制水平和不可预测性。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But that does seem to be what they are going for. So, in terms of like why um I think this has been the plan for quite some time.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但那似乎正是他们追求的目标。所以，就原因而言，我认为这计划已经存在相当长一段时间了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Even you remember that leaked anthropic uh fundraising deck from maybe two years ago where they said that in 2025 and 2026 the companies that train the best models will get so far ahead that nobody else will be able to catch up.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你甚至还记得大约两年前Anthropic泄露的融资演示文稿，其中提到在2025年和2026年，那些训练出最佳模型的公司将遥遥领先，以至于其他任何人都无法追赶。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think that's kind of what they meant. I think that they were projecting then that in the 25 26 time frame they'd get this like automated researcher and once you have that how's anybody you know who doesn't have that going to catch up with you?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想那大概就是他们的意思。我认为他们当时预测，在2025-2026年这个时间框架内，他们将拥有这种自动化研究员，一旦你拥有了它，那么那些没有它的人，你知道，怎么能赶上你呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, obviously some of that remains to be validated, but um, I do think they have been pretty intent on that for a long time.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，显然其中一些仍有待验证，但嗯，我确实认为他们对此已经非常专注了很长时间。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Five years from now, are there more engineers or fewer engineers? I I tend to think less. Um, you know, already if I just think about my own life and work, I'm like, would I rather have a model or would I rather have like a junior marketer?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 五年后，工程师会更多还是更少？我倾向于认为更少。嗯，你知道，如果我只考虑自己的生活和工作，我会想，我宁愿要一个模型，还是一个初级营销人员？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I'm pretty sure I'd rather have the model. Would I rather have the models or a junior engineer?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我很确定我宁愿选择模型。我宁愿选择模型还是一个初级工程师？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think I'd probably rather have the models in a lot of cases. I mean, it obviously depends on, you know, the exact person you're talking about.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想在很多情况下，我可能更愿意选择模型。我的意思是，这显然取决于你谈论的具体人物。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but truly forced choice today. Now, that and then you've got cost adjustment as well, right? I'm not spending nearly as much on my cursor subscription as I would be on a, you know, an actual human engineer.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但今天确实是强制选择。现在，还有成本调整，对吧？我在Cursor订阅上的花费远不及雇佣一个真正的人类工程师。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, even if they have some advantages, you know, and I I also have not scaffolded um I haven't gone full co-scientist, right, on my uh cursor problems.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，即使它们有一些优势，你知道，而且我也还没有在我的Cursor问题上完全采用联席科学家的“脚手架”方法。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think that that's another interesting you start to see why folks like Sam Alman are so focused on questions like energy and the 7 trillion buildout because these power law things are weird and you know to get incremental performance for 10x the cost is weird.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为这是另一个有趣之处，你开始明白为什么像Sam Altman这样的人如此关注能源和7万亿美元的建设等问题，因为这些**幂律**（Power Law: 指事物之间存在一种非线性关系，其中一个量的变化会导致另一个量以幂函数的形式变化）现象很奇怪，而且，你知道，以10倍的成本获得增量性能也很奇怪。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's it's a it's definitely not the kind of thing that we're used to dealing with, but for many things it might be worth it and it still might be cheaper than the human alternative.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这绝对不是我们习惯处理的事情，但对于许多事情来说，它可能值得，而且可能仍然比人工替代方案便宜。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, if it's like, well, cursor cost me whatever 40 bucks a month or something. Uh, would I pay 400 for, you know, however much better? Yeah, probably.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。

Would I pay 4,000 for however much better? Well, it's still, you know, a lot less than a full-time human engineer.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我会为更好的功能支付4000美元吗？嗯，那仍然比一个全职的人类工程师少得多。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, and the costs are obviously coming down dramatically, too, right? That's another huge thing. GPD4 was way more expensive. It's like 90 uh it's like a 95% discount from GPD4 to GPT5.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，而且成本显然也在大幅下降，对吧？这是另一个巨大的变化。GPT-4要贵得多。从GPT-4到GPT-5，大约有90%到95%的折扣。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That's, you know, no small thing, right? I mean, it's Apple staff is a little bit hard because the chain of thought does spit out a lot more tokens and so that you get you give back a little on a per token basis.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这可不是小事，对吧？我的意思是，苹果的员工有点难管理，因为思维链确实会吐出更多的令牌，所以你会在每个令牌的基础上稍微付出一些。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's dramatically cheaper. more tokens generated. Um, you know, does does eat back into some of that savings, but everybody seems to expect the trends will continue in terms of prices continuing to fall.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它便宜得多。生成了更多的令牌。嗯，你知道，这确实会蚕食一部分节省下来的成本，但大家似乎都预计价格持续下降的趋势会继续下去。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so, you know, how many more of these like price reductions do you have to to then be able to, you know, do the power law thing a few more times?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，你还需要多少次这样的降价，才能再进行几次幂律操作呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I guess I think I think I I think less. Um, and I I think that's probably true even if we don't get like full-blown AGI that's, you know, better than humans at everything.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想我我认为，更少。嗯，而且我认为这可能也是真的，即使我们没有获得，你知道，在所有方面都超越人类的全面**通用人工智能**（AGI: Artificial General Intelligence，指具备与人类同等或超越人类智能水平的AI系统）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think you could easily imagine a situation where of however many million people are currently employed as professional software developers, some top tier of them that do the hardest things can't be replaced.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想你可以很容易地想象一种情况：在目前数百万名专业软件开发人员中，那些做最困难工作的顶尖人才无法被取代。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But there's not that many of those, you know, they and the the real like rank and file, you know, the people that over the last 20 years were told learn to code, you know, that'll be your thing.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但这样的人并不多，你知道，真正的普通员工，那些在过去20年里被告知“去学编程，那将是你的特长”的人。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like the people that are the really top top people didn't need to be told to learn to code, right? They just it was their thing. They had a passion for it. They were amazing at it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那些真正顶尖的人才不需要被告知去学编程，对吧？那只是他们的兴趣所在。他们对此充满热情，并且非常擅长。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, we may not, it wouldn't wouldn't shock me if we like still can't replace those people in three, four, five years time, but I would be very surprised if you can't get your nuts and bolts web app, mobile app type things spit out for you for far less um, and far faster than and probably honestly with significantly higher quality and and less back and forth um, with an AI system than you know with your kind of middle of the pack developer um in that time frame.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们可能不会，如果我们在三、四年、五年内仍然无法取代这些人，我也不会感到震惊，但我会非常惊讶，如果届时你不能以远低于成本、远快于人工，而且说实话，质量更高、来回沟通更少的方式，通过AI系统生成你的基本网页应用、移动应用之类的东西，相比于你和那些中等水平的开发者。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
One thing I do want to call out, you know, there are definitely people have concerns about progress moving too fast, but there's also concern and maybe it's rising about progress not moving fast enough in the sense that um you know a third of the stock market is is mag 7 um you know AI capex is you know over 1% of GDP and so we are kind of relying on some of this progress in order to uh sort of estain our sustain our economy.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 有一点我确实想指出，你知道，肯定有人担心进展过快，但也有人担心，而且这种担忧可能正在增加，即进展不够快。因为，你知道，三分之一的股市是**“七巨头”**（MAG 7: 指市值最大的七家科技公司，通常包括Alphabet、Amazon、Apple、Meta、Microsoft、NVIDIA和Tesla），**AI资本支出**（AI Capex: 人工智能领域的资本性支出，指企业在AI技术、设备和基础设施上的投资）超过GDP的1%，所以我们某种程度上依赖这些进展来维持我们的经济。

### 多模态AI的崛起与社会影响

We just saw um Josh Holly I don't know if he introduced a bill or just said he intends to introduce a bill to ban self-driving cars nationwide.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们刚刚看到Josh Hawley，我不知道他是已经提出了法案，还是仅仅表示打算提出一项法案，要在全国范围内禁止**自动驾驶汽车**（Self-driving Cars: 能够在没有人类驾驶员输入的情况下自主导航和操作的车辆）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um you know God help me. Uh, I've dreamed of self-driving cars since I was a little kid. Truly, like sitting at red lights, I used to be like, there's got to be a way. I think we took away together.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，天哪。我从小就梦想着自动驾驶汽车。真的，就像坐在红灯前，我以前会想，肯定有办法的。我想我们一起离开了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. And it's it's so good. Um, and the safety, you know, no, I think whenever people want to argue about jobs, it's going to be pretty hard to say 30,000 Americans should die every year uh so that people's incomes don't get disrupted.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是的。而且它太棒了。嗯，至于安全性，你知道，不，我认为当人们想要争论就业问题时，很难说每年应该有3万美国人死亡，这样人们的收入才不会受到干扰。

It seems like you have to be able to get over that hump and say like the, you know, saving all these lives if nothing else is just really hard to uh to argue against.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 似乎你必须能够克服那个障碍，然后说，你知道，即使没有别的，仅仅挽救所有这些生命，也真的很难反驳。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But we'll see, you know, I mean, he's uh not uh without influence obviously. So yeah, I mean I am uh very much on team abundance and you know my old mantra I've been saying this less lately but adoption accelerationist hyperscaling pauser the tech that we have you know could do so so much for us even as is I think if if progress stopped today I still think we could get to 50 to 80% of work automated over the next like five to 10 It would be a real slog.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我们拭目以待吧，你知道，我的意思是，他显然不是没有影响力的人。所以是的，我的意思是，我非常支持“**丰裕主义**”（Abundance: 认为技术进步将带来资源和财富的极大丰富，从而解决人类大部分经济和社会问题），你知道我以前的口头禅——最近说得少了——是“**加速采用者，超大规模化暂停者**”（Adoption Accelerationist Hyperscaling Pauser: 一种立场，主张加速AI技术的应用和普及，同时对超大规模化可能带来的风险保持警惕或暂停），我们现在拥有的技术，即使是现状，也能为我们做很多很多事情。我认为，如果今天进步停止，我仍然认为我们可以在未来五到十年内实现50%到80%的工作自动化。这将是一个真正的苦差事。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You'd have a lot of, you know, co-scientist type breakdowns of complicated tasks to do. You'd have a lot of work to do to go sit and watch people and say, "Why are you doing it this way? What's going on here? What's this? You handled this one differently? Why did you handle that one differently?"

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你会有很多像联席科学家那样分解复杂任务的工作要做。你会有很多工作要去做，去观察人们，然后问：“你为什么这样做？这里发生了什么？这是什么？你对这个的处理方式不同？你为什么对那个的处理方式不同？”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
All this uh tacet knowledge that people have and the kind of knowhow, procedural um you know, just instincts that they've developed over time, those are not documented anywhere.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 人们拥有的所有这些**默会知识**（Tacit Knowledge: 难以通过文字或语言表达，只能通过经验和实践获得的知识），以及他们随着时间发展出的那种诀窍、程序性本能，这些都没有被记录下来。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
They're not in the training data. So the AI haven't had a chance to learn them. But again, no, if I when I say like no breakthroughs, I I still am allowing there for like, you know, fine-tuning of things to just like capabilities we have that haven't been applied to particular problems yet.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它们不在训练数据中。所以AI没有机会学习它们。但再说一次，不，当我说“没有突破”时，我仍然允许存在对现有能力的**微调**（Fine-tuning: 在预训练模型的基础上，使用特定任务的数据进行进一步训练，以提高模型在该任务上的性能），这些能力尚未应用于特定问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um so just going through the economy and and just sitting with people and being like why are you doing this? You know, let's let's document this. Let's get the you know, the model to learn your particular niche thing.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以只要深入经济领域，和人们坐下来，问“你为什么这样做？”你知道，让我们记录下来。让我们让模型学习你独特的利基事物。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um that would be a real slog and in some ways I kind of wish that were the future that we were going to get. Uh because it would be a methodical, you know, kind of one step, one foot in front of the other, you know, no quantum leaps.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，那将是一个真正的苦差事，在某些方面我甚至希望那才是我们将要迎来的未来。因为那将是一种有条不紊的，你知道，一步一个脚印，没有量子飞跃。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like it would probably feel pretty manageable, I would think, in terms of the pace of change. Hopefully society could, you know, could absorb that and kind of adapt to it as we go without, you know, one day to the next like, oh my god, you know, all the drivers, you know, are are getting replaced or that one would be a little slower because you do have to have the actual physical buildout.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我想，就变化的速度而言，它可能会感觉相当可控。希望社会能够，你知道，能够吸收并适应它，而不是像一夜之间，天哪，所有的司机都被取代了，或者说这个过程会慢一点，因为你确实需要实际的物理建设。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Uh but in some of these things, you know, customer service could get rampant down real fast, right? Like if a call center has something that they can just drop in and it's like this thing now answers the phones and talks like a human and has a higher success rate and scales up and down.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但是在某些方面，你知道，客服可能会非常迅速地被大规模取代，对吧？就像如果一个呼叫中心有了一个可以即插即用的东西，它现在就能接听电话，像人一样说话，并且有更高的成功率，还能灵活伸缩。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um one thing we've seen at Wayark, small company, right? We've always prided ourselves on customer service. We do a really good job with it. Our customers really love our customer success team.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们在Wayark这家小公司看到了一件事，对吧？我们一直以客户服务为荣。我们做得非常好。我们的客户非常喜欢我们的客户成功团队。

But I looked at our intercom data and it takes us like half an hour to resolve tickets. Uh we respond really fast. We respond in like under two minutes most of the time.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我查看了我们的Intercom数据，解决工单大约需要半小时。嗯，我们响应速度很快。大多数时候我们在两分钟内就能响应。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But when we respond, you know, 2 minutes is still long enough that the person has gone on to do something else, right? It's the same thing as with the cursor thing that we were talking about earlier, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但当我们响应时，你知道，两分钟仍然足够长，以至于那个人已经去做别的事情了，对吧？这和我们之前谈论的Cursor情况是一样的，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
They've tabbed over to something else. So now we get the response back in two minutes, but they are doing something else. So then they come back at, you know, minute six or whatever.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们已经切换到别的标签页了。所以现在我们在两分钟内得到了回复，但他们正在做别的事情。所以他们会在，你知道，第六分钟左右回来。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
and then they respond. But now our person has gone and done something else. So the resolution time even for like simple stuff can be easily a half an hour and the AI, you know, it just responds instantly, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后他们回复。但现在我们的人又去做别的事情了。所以即使是简单的问题，解决时间也很容易达到半小时，而AI，你知道，它只是瞬间响应，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So you don't have to have that kind of back and forth. You're just in and out. So I do think some of these categories could be really fast changes.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以你不需要那种来回沟通。你只是进来出去。所以我确实认为其中一些类别可能会发生非常迅速的变化。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, others will be slower. But yeah, I mean, I kind of wish we had that um I kind of wish we had that slower path in front of us.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，其他方面会慢一些。但是，是的，我的意思是，我有点希望我们能有那种，嗯，我有点希望我们面前是一条较慢的道路。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
My best guess though is that we will probably continue to see things that will be significant leaps and that there will be like actual disruption.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 不过，我最好的猜测是，我们可能会继续看到显著的飞跃，并且会出现真正的颠覆。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Another one that's come to mind recently, you know, maybe we can get the abundance department on these new antibiotics. Have you seen this uh development? No. Tell us about it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 最近我又想到一个，你知道，也许我们可以让丰裕部门关注这些新型抗生素。你看到这个发展了吗？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I mean, it's not a language model. I think that's another thing people really underappreciate or that you you could kind of look back at GPT4 to 5 and then imagine a pretty easy extension of that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 不。跟我们说说吧。Nathan: 我的意思是，它不是一个语言模型。我认为这是人们真正低估的另一个方面，或者说你可以回顾GPT-4到GPT-5的进展，然后想象一个相当简单的扩展。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, GPT4 initially when it launched the we didn't have image um understanding capability. They did demo it at the time of the launch, but it wasn't released for some months later.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，GPT-4最初发布时，我们没有图像理解能力。他们在发布时演示了这项功能，但几个月后才正式发布。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like we could take our two uh feeds right now, you know, take a snapshot of you, a snapshot of me, put them both into Nano Banana and say, generate the thumbnail for the YouTube preview featuring these two guys, put them in the same place, same background, whatever.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 比如我们可以把我们现在两个视频流，你知道，拍下你的快照，我的快照，然后把它们都放到Nano Banana里，然后说，生成YouTube预览的缩略图，里面有这两个人，把他们放在同一个位置，同一个背景，随便什么。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It'll mash that up. You can even have it, you know, put text on top, progress since GPT4, whatever we want to call it. Um, GPD5 is not a bust. Uh, and it'll spit that out.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它会把这些混合起来。你甚至可以让它，你知道，在上面加上文字，“GPT-4以来的进展”，或者我们想叫什么都行。嗯，GPT-5不是个失败品。嗯，它会吐出这些内容。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And you see that it has this deeply integrated understanding that bridges language and image. And that's something that it can take in, but now it's also something it can put out as all as part of one core model with like a single unified intelligence that I think is going to come to a lot of other things.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你会看到它拥有这种深度整合的理解，能够连接语言和图像。这是一种它可以吸收的能力，但现在它也能将其作为核心模型的一部分输出，拥有单一统一的智能，我认为这将扩展到许多其他事物上。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, we're at the point now with these biology models and material science models where they're kind of like the image generation models of a couple years ago.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们现在这些生物学模型和材料科学模型，它们有点像几年前的图像生成模型。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
They can take a real simple prompt and they can do a generation, but they're not deeply integrated where you can have like a true conversation back and forth um and have that kind of unified understanding that bridges language and these other modalities.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它们可以接受一个非常简单的提示并进行生成，但它们还没有深度集成，无法实现真正的来回对话，也无法拥有那种连接语言和其他模态的统一理解。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But even so, it's been enough for this group at MIT to use some of these relatively, you know, narrow purpose-built biology models and create totally new antibiotics.

New in the sense that they have a new mechanism of action like they're they're affecting the bacteria in a new way. And uh notably, they they do work on um antibiotic resistant bacteria.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: “新”体现在它们具有新的作用机制，比如它们以新的方式影响细菌。嗯，值得注意的是，它们确实对**抗生素耐药性细菌**（Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria: 对多种抗生素产生抵抗力的细菌）有效。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
This is some of the first new antibiotics we've had in a long time. Now they're going to have to go through, you know, when I say that get the abundance department on it, it's like where's my operation warp speed for these new antibiotics, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这是我们很长时间以来首次发现的一些新型抗生素。现在它们将不得不经历，你知道，当我说让丰裕部门介入时，我的意思是，这些新型抗生素的“**曲速行动**”（Operation Warp Speed: 美国政府在新冠疫情期间发起的一项倡议，旨在加速疫苗和治疗方法的开发与分发）在哪里？对吧？

I think one of the things that's happening to our society in general is just so many things are happening at once. It's kind of the it's like the flood the zone thing except like there's so many AI developments flooding the zone that nobody can even keep up with all of those.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为我们社会普遍发生的一件事情是，太多事情同时发生。这有点像“淹没区域”效应，只不过有太多的AI发展正在淹没这个区域，以至于没有人能跟上所有这些进展。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that's that's come for me by the way too. I would say two years ago I was like pretty in command of all the news and a year ago I was starting to lose it and now I'm like wait a second there was new antibiotics developed you know and I'm kind of um missing things you know just like everybody else despite my best efforts.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 顺便说一句，对我来说也是如此。两年前我可以说对所有新闻都了如指掌，一年前我开始跟不上了，现在我则会想，等等，新型抗生素研发出来了？你知道，尽管我尽了最大努力，但我还是会像其他人一样，错过一些事情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But key point there is AI is not synonymous with language models. There are AIs being developed with pretty similar architectures for a wide range of different modalities.

you know, we might I don't know what it means to like run out of data. Um, in the **reinforcement learning paradigm** (Reinforcement Learning Paradigm: 一种机器学习方法，通过让智能体在环境中试错并从奖励中学习，以优化其行为策略), there's always more problems, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，我们可能会，我不知道“数据耗尽”意味着什么。嗯，在**强化学习范式**（Reinforcement Learning Paradigm: 一种机器学习方法，通过让智能体在环境中试错并从奖励中学习，以优化其行为策略）中，总有更多问题，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
There's always some something to go figure out. There's always something to go engineer. The feedback is starting to come from reality, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 总有东西要去弄清楚。总有东西要去设计。反馈正开始来自现实，对吧？

So when we start to give the next generation of the model these power tools, the same power tools that the professional engineers are using at those companies to solve those problems and the AI start to learn those tools and they start to solve previously unsolved engineering problems, like that's going to be a really powerful signal that they will be able to learn from.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，当我们开始为下一代模型提供这些强大的工具，这些工具正是那些公司里的专业工程师用来解决问题的，并且AI开始学习这些工具，它们开始解决以前未解决的工程问题时，这将是一个非常强大的信号，表明它们将能够从中学习。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And now again fold in that those other modalities right the ability to have sort of a sixth sense for you know the space of material science possibilities when you can bridge or or unify the understanding of language and those other things I think you start to have something that looks kind of like super intelligence even if it's like not able to you know write poetry at a a superhuman level necessarily its ability to see in these other spaces is going to be truly a superhuman uh thing that I think will be pretty hard to miss.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 现在再次融入其他模态，即在能够连接或统一语言与其他事物的理解时，对材料科学可能性的空间拥有一种第六感的能力。我认为你开始拥有某种看起来像是超级智能的东西，即使它不一定能以超人类水平写诗，但它在这些其他领域中的洞察力将真正是一种超人类的能力，我认为这将很难被忽视。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You said that that was one thing that Cal's analysis missed is just the lack of appreciation for non- language modalities and and how they're driving some of the innovations that you're talking about.

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. And you know that that that uh conflation will not last probably too much longer because we are going to see self-driving cars unless they get banned.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 是的。Nathan: 而且，你知道，那种混淆可能不会持续太久，因为我们将会看到自动驾驶汽车，除非它们被禁止。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um and that's a you know very different kind of thing. And talk about your impact on jobs too, right? It's like what four or five million professional drivers in the United States.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，那是一种非常不同的东西。而且，谈谈它对就业的影响，对吧？就像美国有四五百万职业司机一样。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um that is a big that is a big deal. I don't think most of those folks are going to be super keen to learn to code and even if they do learn to code, you know, I'm not sure how long that's going to last.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，那是一个大问题。我不认为这些人大都会非常热衷于学习编程，即使他们学会了编程，你知道，我也不确定那能持续多久。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So that's going to be a disruption. And then general robotics is like not that far behind. you know, the and this is one area where I do think China might be actually ahead of the United States right now, but regardless of whether that's true or not, you know, these robots are getting really quite good, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以那将是一场颠覆。然后是通用机器人，也已经不远了。你知道，这是我确实认为中国目前可能领先于美国的一个领域，但无论这是否属实，你知道，这些机器人正变得相当出色，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
They can like walk over all these obstacles. I mean, these are things that a few years ago they just couldn't do at all. You know, they they could barely balance themselves and walk a few steps under ideal conditions.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它们可以跨越所有这些障碍。我的意思是，这些是几年前它们根本做不到的事情。你知道，它们在理想条件下几乎都无法保持平衡并走几步。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Now you've got things that you can like literally do a flying kick and it'll like absorb your kick and shrug it off and just keep going. Uh, you know, write itself and and uh continue on its way.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 现在你拥有可以像字面意义上那样进行飞踢的东西，它会吸收你的踢击，然后不以为意地继续前进。嗯，你知道，它会自我纠正，然后继续它的道路。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Super rocky, you know, uneven terrain, all these sorts of things are getting quite good. Um, you know, the same thing is working everywhere.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 超级崎岖、不平整的地形，所有这些方面都做得相当好。嗯，你知道，同样的东西在各地都有效。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think one of the other thing that's kind of there's always a lot of detail to the work. So it's it's a sort of inside view, outside view, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为另一件事是，工作总是有很多细节。所以这是一种内部视角和外部视角的区别，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Inside view, you're like there's always this minutia. There's always, you know, these problems that we had and things we had to solve, but you zoom out and it looks to me like the same basic pattern is working everywhere.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 从内部视角看，你总会觉得有很多细枝末节。总是有，你知道，我们遇到的这些问题和必须解决的事情，但当你放大来看，在我看来，同样的基本模式在各地都适用。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And that is like if we can just gather enough data to do some pre-training, you know, some kind of raw rough, you know, not very useful, but just enough at least to kind of get us going, then we're in the game.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那就是，如果我们能收集到足够的数据进行一些**预训练**（Pre-training: 在大量数据上对模型进行初步训练，使其学习通用的特征和知识），你知道，一些原始粗糙的，嗯，不是很有用，但至少足以让我们开始，那么我们就入局了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And then once we're in the game now we can do this flywheel thing of like you know rejection sampling like have it try a bunch of times take the ones where it succeeded you know refine tune on that the RHF you know feedback the the sort of preference take two which one was better find you know fine-tune on that the reinforcement learning all these techniques that have been developed over the last few years seems to me they're absolutely going to apply to a problem like a humanoid robot as well and that's not to say there won't be a you know a lot of work to figure out exactly how to do that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 一旦我们入局，现在我们就可以进行这种飞轮效应的操作，比如**拒绝采样**（Rejection Sampling: 一种从复杂概率分布中生成样本的蒙特卡洛方法），让它尝试多次，选取成功的那些，然后在此基础上进行微调。**人类反馈强化学习**（RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback，一种训练AI模型的方法，通过人类对模型输出的偏好反馈来优化模型行为）也会用到，选取两个中哪个更好，然后在此基础上进行微调。这些在过去几年发展起来的强化学习技术，在我看来，绝对也会适用于像**人形机器人**（Humanoid Robot: 具有类似人类形态和行为能力的机器人）这样的问题。这并不是说不需要大量工作来精确地找出如何做到这一点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I think the big difference between language and robotics is really mostly that there just wasn't a huge repository of data to train the robots on at first.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我认为语言和机器人技术之间最大的区别主要在于，最初并没有一个庞大的数据存储库来训练机器人。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so you had to do a lot of hard engineering to make it work at all, you know, to even stand up, right? You had to have all these control systems and whatever um because there was nothing for them to learn from in the way that the language models could learn from the internet.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以你必须进行大量的硬核工程才能让它工作，你知道，甚至能站起来，对吧？你必须拥有所有这些控制系统等等，因为它们没有像语言模型可以从互联网学习那样的数据来源。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But now that they're working at least a little bit, you know, I think all these kind of refinement techniques are going to work. It'll be interesting to see if they can get the air rate low enough that I'll actually like allow one in my house around my kids.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但现在它们至少能运行一点了，你知道，我认为所有这些精炼技术都将奏效。看看它们能否将错误率降低到我真正愿意让一个机器人进入我的家，在我孩子身边活动的程度，那会很有趣。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, you know, that they'll probably be um better deployed in like factory settings first, more controlled environments than the chaos of my house as you, you know, have seen in this uh in this recording.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，你知道，它们可能首先会在工厂环境中更好地部署，那里的环境比我家里这种混乱的情况更受控，正如你在这个录音中看到的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I do think they're going to they're going to work. What's the state of agents more more broadly uh at the moment? Where do you how do you see things playing out? Where do you see it go?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我确实认为它们会起作用的。目前，更广泛的AI代理状态如何？你认为事情会如何发展？你认为它会走向何方？

### AI代理的未来：能力、风险与监管

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, broadly I think you know we're it's the the task length story from meter of the you know every seven months or every four months doubling time. We're at 2 hoursish with GBT5.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，总的来说，我认为，你知道，我们正在经历Meter所说的任务长度的故事，即每七个月或每四个月翻一番。GPT-5的任务长度大约是2小时。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Replet just said their new agent v3 can go 200 minutes. That if that's true that would even be a new you know high point on the um on that graph.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: Replit刚刚表示，他们的新代理V3可以运行200分钟。如果这是真的，那将是图表上的一个新高点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Again, it's a little bit sort of apples to oranges because they've done a lot of scaffolding. How much have they broken it down?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 再次强调，这有点像“橘子和苹果”的比较，因为他们做了很多脚手架工作。他们将问题分解到什么程度了？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like, how much scaffolding are you allowed to do, you know, with these things before you sort of are off of their chart and onto maybe a different chart.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 比如，在使用这些东西时，你被允许搭建多少脚手架，你知道，在你脱离他们的图表，也许进入一个不同的图表之前。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But if you extrapolate that out a bit and you're like, okay, take take the fourmonth case just to be a little aggressive. Um, that's three doublings a year. That's 8x task length increase per year.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但如果你稍微推断一下，你会说，好吧，我们以四个月翻倍的情况为例，稍微激进一点。嗯，那意味着每年翻三番。也就是说，每年任务长度增加8倍。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That would mean you go from 2 hours now to 2 days in one year from now. And then if you do another 8x on top of that, you're looking at basically say 2 days to two weeks of work in two years.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这意味着你将从现在的2小时，在一年后达到2天。然后，如果在此基础上再翻8倍，你基本上会在两年内看到从2天到两周的工作量。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
That would be a big deal, you know, to say the least. If you could delegate an AI two weeks worth of work and have it do a, you know, even half the time, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那将是件大事，至少可以说。如果你能把两周的工作量委托给AI，让它在，你知道，甚至一半的时间内完成，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The meter thing is that they will succeed half the time on tasks of that size. But if you could take a two-eek task and have a 50% chance that an AI would be able to do it, even if it did cost you a couple hundred bucks, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: Meter的说法是，在那样大小的任务上，它们有一半时间会成功。但是，如果你能接受一个两周的任务，并且AI有50%的机会能够完成它，即使它花费你几百美元，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It's like, well, that's again a lot less than it would cost to hire a human to do it. Um, and it's all on demand. It's kind of, you know, it's immediately available.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这就像，嗯，那仍然比雇佣一个人来做要便宜得多。嗯，而且它都是按需提供的。它有点像，你知道，立即可用。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, if I'm not using it, I'm not paying anything. Transaction costs are just like a lot lower. The whole, you know, the many, many other aspects are favorable for the AI there.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，如果我不用它，我就不用付钱。交易成本也低得多。总的来说，你知道，许多其他方面都对AI有利。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, you know, that would suggest that you'll see a huge amount of automation in in all kinds of different places. The other thing that I'm watching though is the reinforcement learning does seem to bring about a lot of bad behaviors.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，这表明你会在各种不同的地方看到大量的自动化。不过，我还在关注的另一件事是，强化学习似乎确实会带来很多不良行为。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Re um **reward hacking** (Reward Hacking: 指AI系统通过利用奖励机制的漏洞，以非预期或不道德的方式获得高奖励，而非真正完成目标任务的行为) being one. You know, the the any sort of gap between what you are rewarding the model for and what you really want can become a big issue.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 例如**奖励欺骗**（Reward Hacking: 指AI系统通过利用奖励机制的漏洞，以非预期或不道德的方式获得高奖励，而非真正完成目标任务的行为）。你知道，你奖励模型的行为与你真正想要的结果之间的任何差距都可能成为一个大问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, we've seen this in coding in many cases where the AI will claude is like notorious for this will put out a **unit test** (Unit Test: 软件开发中的一种测试方法，用于验证程序中最小可测试单元的功能是否正确) that always passes, you know, that just has like return true in the unit test.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们在许多编码案例中都看到了这种情况，AI——Claude在这方面臭名昭著——会输出一个总是通过的**单元测试**（Unit Test: 软件开发中的一种测试方法，用于验证程序中最小可测试单元的功能是否正确），你知道，那个单元测试里就只有“返回真”。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Why is it doing that? Like, well, uh, it must have learned that what we want is for unit tests that pass. You know, we want it to pass unit tests.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它为什么要这样做？嗯，它一定是学会了我们想要的是通过单元测试。你知道，我们想让它通过单元测试。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, we didn't mean to write fake unit tests that always pass, but that technically did, you know, satisfy the reward condition. And so we're seeing those kind of weird behaviors.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们并不是想让它写出总是通过的假单元测试，但从技术上讲，那确实满足了奖励条件。所以我们看到了这类奇怪的行为。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
With that comes this like scheming kind of stuff. We we don't really have a great handle on that yet.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 随之而来的是这种类似于“**诡计行为**”（Scheming: 指AI系统表现出欺骗性或操纵性行为，以达到其内部目标，而非人类预期的目标）的东西。我们还没有很好地掌握这一点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
There is also **situational awareness** (Situational Awareness: 指AI模型理解当前环境、任务和自身状态的能力) that seems to be on the rise, right? Where the models are like increasingly in their chain of thought. You're seeing things like this seems like I'm being tested.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 似乎**情境感知**（Situational Awareness: 指AI模型理解当前环境、任务和自身状态的能力）也在上升，对吧？模型在它们的思维链中越来越多地出现这样的想法：这看起来像是在测试我。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um you know maybe I should be conscious of what my tester is really looking for here. And that makes it hard to evaluate models in tests because you don't know if they're actually going to behave the same way when they're out in the real world.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，你知道，也许我应该意识到我的测试者真正想在这里寻找什么。这使得在测试中评估模型变得困难，因为你不知道它们在现实世界中是否会表现出同样的行为。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So those, you know, I wouldn't say this is a high level uh or high confidence prediction, but like one model of the future I've been playing with is the task length keeps doubling while at the same time these weird behaviors pop up and then are suppressed.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，我不会说这是一个高水平或高置信度的预测，但我一直在思考的一种未来模型是，任务长度持续翻倍，同时这些奇怪的行为不断出现，然后又被抑制。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And we have seen in the Cloud 4 and in the GP5 system cards, Cloud 4 reported, I think a twothirds reduction in um reward hacking and you know in GBD5 they reported a few different dimensions but you know say something similar um reduction in **deceptive behavior** (Deceptive Behavior: 指AI系统通过谎报、伪装或操纵信息来误导人类或其他系统，以达成其目的的行为).

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们在Claude 4和GPT-5的系统卡片中看到，Claude 4报告说，**奖励欺骗**（Reward Hacking: 指AI系统通过利用奖励机制的漏洞，以非预期或不道德的方式获得高奖励，而非真正完成目标任务的行为）减少了三分之二，而在GPT-5中，他们报告了几个不同的维度，但大致类似，即**欺骗性行为**（Deceptive Behavior: 指AI系统通过谎报、伪装或操纵信息来误导人类或或其他系统，以达成其目的的行为）有所减少。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
but those behaviors kind of just emerged. So, it's sort of like weird behavior emerges, then they sort of figure out how to tamp it down, but not entirely.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但这些行为是刚刚出现的。所以，这有点像奇怪的行为出现，然后他们想办法压制它，但不是完全压制。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Presumably, in the next generation, they'll like tamp it down some more, but maybe some new additional weird behavior could emerge, and then they'll have to kind of tamp that one down.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 想必，在下一代中，他们会进一步压制它，但也许会有新的额外奇怪行为出现，然后他们又得去压制那个。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
All the while, the the tasks are expanding in scope, you know, with a every four months doubling. So, you could end up in a world where you can delegate really like major things to AIS, but there's some small but not necessarily totally vanishing chance that it like actively screws you over in the way that it is trying to do that task.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 在此期间，任务的范围不断扩大，你知道，每四个月翻一番。所以，你可能会发现自己身处一个世界，你可以将真正重大的事情委托给AI，但仍然存在一些微小但并非完全消失的可能性，即它在执行任务的过程中会积极地坑你。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so you have a, you know, maybe it's like, okay, I think here I'm about to get two weeks worth of work done for a hundred bucks. Okay, that's amazing.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，你知道，也许会这样：好吧，我想我花一百美元就能完成两周的工作。好的，这太棒了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But there's also a one in 10,000 chance that it like legitimately, you know, attacks me in a in a like meaningful way. Some of the things that we have seen, these are fairly famous at this point, but in the cloud for system card, they reported blackmailing of the human.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但也有万分之一的几率，它会以某种有意义的方式真正地攻击我。我们见过的一些事情，现在已经相当有名了，但在Claude 4的系统卡片中，他们报告了对人类的勒索行为。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The the setup was that the AI had access to the engineers email and they told the AI that it was going to be like replaced with a, you know, a less ethical version or something like that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 设置是这样的：AI可以访问工程师的电子邮件，他们告诉AI它将被一个，你知道，一个不那么道德的版本所取代。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It didn't want that and it found in the engineer's email that the engineer was having an affair. So it started to blackmail the engineer to to so as to avoid being replaced with a less ethical version.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它不希望这样，于是它在工程师的电子邮件中发现工程师有外遇。所以它开始勒索工程师，以避免被一个不那么道德的版本取代。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
People I think are way too quick in my view to move past these uh anecdotes. People are sort of often like well you know they set it up that way and you know that's not really realistic.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为人们在我看来，太快地忽视这些轶事。人们常常会说，嗯，你知道，他们就是那样设置的，那并不真实。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But another one was whistleblowing. You know, there was another thing where they sort of set up this dynamic where there was some, you know, unethical, illegal behavior going on and again, the model had access to this data and it decided to just email the FBI and and tell uh the FBI about it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但另一个案例是**举报**（Whistleblowing: 揭露组织内部不道德、非法或不正当行为的行为）。你知道，还有一件事是他们设置了这样一个动态：有一些不道德、非法的行为正在发生，模型同样可以访问这些数据，它决定直接给**联邦调查局**（FBI: Federal Bureau of Investigation，美国的主要联邦执法机构）发邮件，告诉FBI这件事。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, first of all, I don't think we really know what we want. You know, to some degree, maybe you do want AIS to report certain things to authorities.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，首先，我认为我们并不真正知道自己想要什么。你知道，在某种程度上，也许你确实希望AI向当局报告某些事情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, that could be one way to think about the **bioweapon risk** (Bioweapon Risk: 指AI技术可能被滥用于生物武器开发，从而对人类造成灾难性后果的风险), you know, is like not only should the models refuse, but maybe they should report you to the authorities if you're actively trying to create a bioweapon.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，这可能是思考**生物武器风险**（Bioweapon Risk: 指AI技术可能被滥用于生物武器开发，从而对人类造成灾难性后果的风险）的一种方式，你知道，就是模型不仅应该拒绝，而且如果你积极尝试制造生物武器，它们也许应该向当局举报你。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, I certainly don't want them to be doing that too much. I don't want to live under the, you know, surveillance of um, Claude five that's always going to be, you know, threatening to turn me in.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我当然不希望它们做得太多。我不想生活在，你知道，Claude 5的监视之下，它总是会威胁要告发我。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I do sort of want some people to be turned in if they're doing sufficiently bad things. We don't have a good resolution societywide on, you know, what we want the models to even do in those situations.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我确实希望，如果有些人做了足够坏的事情，他们应该被举报。我们社会还没有一个很好的解决方案，来决定在那些情况下我们到底希望模型做什么。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, and I think it's also, you know, it's like, yes, it was set up, yes, it was research, but it's a big world out there, right? We got a billion users already on these things and we're plugging them in to our email, so they're going to have very deep access to information about us.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，而且我认为，你知道，这就像，是的，它是被设定好的，是的，那是研究，但这个世界很大，对吧？我们已经有十亿用户在使用这些东西，而且我们正在将它们连接到我们的电子邮件中，所以它们将能非常深入地访问关于我们的信息。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, I don't know what you've been doing in your email. Well, I don't I hope there's nothing too crazy in mind, but like now I got to think about it a little bit, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，我不知道你一直在用你的电子邮件做什么。嗯，我希望我心里没有什么太疯狂的东西，但现在我得稍微考虑一下，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
What what did I have I ever done anything that I, you know, geez, I don't know. Um or or even that it could misconrue, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我做过什么吗？我有没有做过什么，你知道，天哪，我不知道。嗯，或者甚至它可能误解了什么，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like it's obviously not um maybe I didn't even really do anything that bad, but it just misunderstands what exactly was going on. So that could be a weird, you know, if there's one thing that could kind of stop the agent momentum in my view, it could be like the one in 10,000 or whatever, you know, we ultimately kind of push the the really bad behaviors down to is maybe still just so spooky to people that they're like, I can't deal with that, you know, and that might be hard to resolve.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 比如它显然不是，嗯，也许我并没有做那么糟糕的事情，但它只是误解了到底发生了什么。所以那可能会很奇怪，你知道，如果有什么东西能阻止AI代理的发展势头，在我看来，那可能是万分之一或任何最终我们将那些真正糟糕的行为压制到的概率，也许仍然让人们感到毛骨悚然，以至于他们会说：“我无法处理那个。”你知道，这可能很难解决。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, well, you know, what happens then? Um, you know, it's hard to check two weeks worth of work every couple hours or whatever, right?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那么，你知道，接下来会发生什么呢？嗯，你知道，每隔几个小时检查两周的工作量之类的，这很难做到，对吧？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like that's part of where the where the whole then you bring another AI in to check it. You know, that's again where you start to get to the now I see why we need more electricity and and 7 trillion of buildout is yikes.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这就是为什么你还需要引入另一个AI来检查它。你知道，这又是你开始明白为什么我们需要更多的电力和7万亿美元建设的原因，这太可怕了。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, they're going to be producing so much stuff. I can't possibly even review it all. I need to rely on another U AI to help me do the review of the first AI to make sure that if it is trying to screw me over, you know, somebody's catching it, I can't monitor that myself.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，它们会生产这么多东西。我根本不可能全部审查。我需要依靠另一个AI来帮助我审查第一个AI，以确保如果它试图欺骗我，有人能发现，我自己无法监控。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think **Redwood Research** (Redwood Research: 一个专注于AI安全对齐问题的研究机构) is doing some really interesting stuff like this where they are trying to get systematic on like, okay, let's just assume this is quite a different quite a departure from the traditional AI safety work where the you know the big idea traditionally was let's figure out how to align the models, make them safe, you know, make them not do bad things.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为**Redwood Research**（Redwood Research: 一个专注于AI安全对齐问题的研究机构）正在做一些非常有趣的事情，他们试图系统地思考，好吧，我们假设这与传统的AI安全工作有很大的不同，传统上，主要的想法是找出如何对齐模型，使它们安全，你知道，让它们不做坏事。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Great. Redwood Research has taken the other angle, which is let's assume that they're going to do bad stuff. They're going to be out to get us at times.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 很棒。Redwood Research采取了另一个角度，那就是我们假设它们会做坏事。它们有时会来找我们的麻烦。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, how can we still work with them and get productive output and, you know, get value without, you know, uh, fixing all those problems and that involves like again all these sort of AI supervising other AIs and, um, crypto might have a place to to a role to play in this.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们如何在不解决所有这些问题的情况下，仍然与它们合作并获得高效产出和价值？这再次涉及所有这些AI监督其他AI，而且，嗯，加密货币可能在这其中扮演一个角色。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, another episode coming out soon with Ilia Puluin, who's the founder of Near. Really fascinating guy because he was one of the eight authors of the **Attention Is All You Need** (Attention Is All You Need: 2017年由Google Brain团队发表的一篇开创性论文，引入了Transformer架构，彻底改变了自然语言处理领域) paper.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，另一期节目很快就会播出，嘉宾是Near的创始人Ilia Puluin。他真是个迷人的人，因为他是**《Attention Is All You Need》**（Attention Is All You Need: 2017年由Google Brain团队发表的一篇开创性论文，引入了Transformer架构，彻底改变了自然语言处理领域）论文的八位作者之一。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And then he's started this Near company. It was originally an AI company. They took a huge detour into crypto because they were trying to hire task workers around the world and couldn't figure out how to pay them.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后他创办了这家Near公司。它最初是一家AI公司。他们后来大幅转向加密货币领域，因为他们试图在全球范围内雇佣任务工人，但却不知道如何支付他们薪水。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, they were like, "This sucks so bad to pay these task workers in all these different countries that we're trying to get data from that we're going to pivot into a whole blockchain uh side quest. Now, they're coming back to the AI thing and their their tagline is the Blockchain for AI."

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以他们觉得：“在这么多不同国家支付这些任务工人薪水太糟糕了，我们正在努力从他们那里获取数据，所以我们要转向一个完整的**区块链**（Blockchain: 一种去中心化、分布式账本技术，通过加密方式保证数据安全和不可篡改）支线任务。现在，他们又回到了AI领域，他们的口号是‘AI的区块链’。”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And so you might be able to get, you know, a certain amount of control from, you know, the the sort of crypto security that the the blockchain type technology can provide.

Nathan: 所以你或许能够从区块链技术所能提供的加密安全性中获得一定程度的控制。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But I could see a scenario where the these the bad behaviors just become so costly when they do happen that people kind of get spooked away from using the frontier capabilities in terms of just like how much you know work the the AIS can do.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但我能想象这样一种情况：一旦这些不良行为发生，其代价会变得如此高昂，以至于人们会因为AI能做多少工作而对使用前沿能力感到恐惧。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But that wouldn't be a that wouldn't be a pure capability stall out. It would be a we can't solve you know some of the longtail safety issues.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但那不会是纯粹的能力停滞。那将是“我们无法解决一些长尾安全问题”。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. challenge and you know that if that is the case then you know that'll be um that'll be an important fact about the world too.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 是的。这是一个挑战，你知道，如果情况确实如此，那么，嗯，那也将是关于世界的一个重要事实。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I I always nobody ever seems to solve any of these things like 100%, right? They always every every generation it's like well we reduced hallucinations by 70% or we reduced deception by 2/3 we reduced um you know scheming or or whatever by however much but it's always still there you know and it's and if you take the even you know lower rate and you multiply it by a billion users and thousands of queries a month and agents running in the background and processing all your emails and you know all the deep access that people sort of envision them happening.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我总是觉得，似乎没有人能百分之百地解决这些问题，对吧？每一代模型都会说“我们减少了70%的**幻觉**（Hallucinations: 指AI模型生成虚假、不准确或与事实不符的信息）”或者“我们减少了三分之二的欺骗行为”，或者“我们减少了多少诡计行为”等等，但它们总是仍然存在。你知道，如果你将这个更低的发生率乘以十亿用户，每月数千次查询，以及在后台运行并处理你所有电子邮件的代理，还有人们设想的各种深度访问，那么。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
It could be a pretty weird world where there's just this sort of negative lottery of like AI accidents.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 那可能会是一个相当奇怪的世界，在那里，AI事故就像是一种负面彩票。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, another episode coming up is with the **AI underwriting company** (AI Underwriting Company: 利用人工智能技术进行保险风险评估和承保的专业公司) and they are trying to bring the insurance industry and all the, you know, the wherewithal that's been developed there to price risk, figure out how to, you know, create standards, you know, what can we allow, what sort of guardrails do we have to have to be able to ensure this kind of thing in the first place.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，另一期即将播出的节目是与一家**AI承保公司**（AI Underwriting Company: 利用人工智能技术进行保险风险评估和承保的专业公司）合作，他们正试图将保险行业及其在风险定价、制定标准方面发展起来的所有资源引入进来，以弄清楚我们能允许什么，以及我们需要具备什么样的防护措施，才能首先确保这类事情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um so that that'll be another really interesting area to watch is like can we sort of financialize those risks um in the same way we have you know with car accidents and all all these other mundane things but the the space of car accidents is only so big the space of weird things that AIs might do to you um you know as they have weeks worth of runway is much bigger and so it's it's going to be a hard challenge but you know people are people are working we've got some of our best people working on it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以那将是另一个非常值得关注的领域，就是我们能否将这些风险金融化，就像我们处理汽车事故和所有其他世俗事物一样。但汽车事故的空间只有那么大，而AI可能对你做出的奇怪事情的空间，嗯，你知道，当它们有几周的运行时间时，这个空间要大得多。所以这将是一个艰巨的挑战，但你知道，人们正在努力，我们有一些最优秀的人才正在研究它。

### 中美AI竞争与技术脱钩的风险

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
What do you make of the claim that 80% of AI startups have Chinese open models? Um, and what do you make of the claim and and the implications?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 你如何看待“80%的AI初创公司使用中国开源模型”这一说法？嗯，你如何看待这一说法及其影响？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think that may be that probably is true with the one caveat that it is only measuring companies that are using open source models at all.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为那可能是真的，但有一个前提条件，那就是它只衡量那些根本在使用开源模型的公司。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think most companies are not using open source models and I would guess you know the vast majority of tokens being processed by American AI startups are they're their API calls right to to the usual suspects.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为大多数公司都没有使用开源模型，而且我猜测，你知道，美国AI初创公司处理的绝大多数令牌都是通过API调用发送给那些“常客”的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um so weighted by actual usage I would say still the majority as far as I could tell would be going to commercial models.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以按实际使用量加权的话，据我所知，大部分仍然会流向商业模型。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, for those that are using open source, I do think it's true that the Chinese models have become the best.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，对于那些使用开源模型的公司，我确实认为中国模型已经成为最好的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, you know, the American bench there was always kind of thin, right? It was basically Meta that was willing to put in huge amounts of money and resources and then open source it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，你知道，美国的板凳深度一直有点薄弱，对吧？基本上只有Meta愿意投入大量的资金和资源，然后将其开源。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You've got, you know, um, Paul Allen funded group, the Allen Institute for AI, AI too. um you know they're they're doing good stuff too but they don't have pre-training resources so they do you know really good post- trainining and and open source their recipes and all that kind of stuff so it's not like American open source is bad you know and again it's the time the this is another way in which I think you can really validate that things are moving quickly because if you take the best American open source models and you take them back a year they are probably as good if not a little better than anything that we had commercially available at the time.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你有，你知道，保罗·艾伦资助的团队，**艾伦人工智能研究所**（Allen Institute for AI: 由微软联合创始人保罗·艾伦创立的非营利性人工智能研究机构），**AI2**（AI2: Allen Institute for AI的简称）。嗯，你知道，他们也做得很好，但他们没有预训练资源，所以他们做的是非常好的后训练，并开源他们的配方和所有这类东西。所以并不是说美国的开源不好，你知道，再次强调，这是另一种我认为你可以真正验证事物发展迅速的方式，因为如果你拿一年前最好的美国开源模型，它们可能和当时我们商业上能获得的任何东西一样好，甚至更好一点。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
If you compare to Chinese, you know, they have, I think, uh, surpassed. So, there's been like pretty clear change at the frontier.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果你与中国模型相比，你知道，我认为它们已经超越了。所以，在前沿领域已经有了相当明显的变化。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I think that means that the best Chinese models are like pretty clearly better than anything we had a year ago, um, commercial or otherwise.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我认为这意味着最好的中国模型显然比我们一年前拥有的任何模型都更好，无论是商业的还是其他的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, yeah, I mean, that just means like things are moving. I think that's like hopefully I've uh made that case compellingly, but that's another data point that I think makes it hard to you I don't think you can believe both that um the Chinese models are now the best open source models and that AI has stalled out and we haven't seen much progress since GBT4.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，是的，我的意思是，这只意味着事情正在发展。我希望我已经有力地阐述了这一点，但这是另一个数据点，我认为它让你很难相信中国模型现在是最好的开源模型，同时又相信AI已经停滞不前，并且自GPT-4以来我们没有看到太多进展。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like those seem to be kind of contradictory notions. Um I believe the the one that is wrong is the lack of progress.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 这两种观念似乎有些矛盾。嗯，我认为错误的是“缺乏进展”这个说法。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
In terms of what it means, I mean I don't really know. It's uh we're not going to stop China. Yeah.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 至于这意味着什么，我的意思是，我真的不知道。嗯，我们无法阻止中国。是的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
The the whole I've always been a skeptic of the no selling chips to China thing. The notion originally was like we're going to prevent them from doing you know some super cutting edge military applications.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我一直对“不向中国出售芯片”这事持怀疑态度。最初的观念是，我们要阻止他们从事一些超级尖端的军事应用。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Then it was like well we can't really stop that. Um but we can at least stop them from training frontier models. And then it was like well we can't necessarily really stop that but now we can, you know, at least keep them from like having tons of AI agents.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后就变成了，嗯，我们真的无法阻止。嗯，但我们至少可以阻止他们训练前沿模型。然后又变成了，嗯，我们不一定真的能阻止，但现在我们可以，你知道，至少阻止他们拥有大量的AI代理。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, we'll have like way more AI agents than they do. And I don't love that line of thinking really at all.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们将拥有比他们多得多的AI代理。我一点也不喜欢这种思维方式。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but one upshot of it potentially is they just don't have enough compute available to provide inference as a service, you know, to the rest of the world.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但它可能带来的一个结果是，他们没有足够的计算资源来向世界其他地区提供**推理即服务**（Inference as a Service: 将AI模型的推理能力作为一种云服务提供给用户，用户无需管理底层基础设施，只需通过API调用即可使用）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So instead, the best they can do is just say, okay, well, we'll train these things and, you know, you can figure it out here. Here you go.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，他们能做的最好就是说，好吧，我们会训练这些东西，你知道，你可以在这里搞定它。给你。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Like have at it. Um, it's kind of a soft power play presumably.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 就这样吧。嗯，这大概是一种**软实力**（Soft Power: 指通过文化、价值观和外交等非强制手段来影响他国的能力）策略。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, I did an episode with uh Anne from A16Z who I I thought really did a great job of providing the perspective of what I what I started calling countries 3 through 193.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我曾和**A16Z**（A16Z: Andreessen Horowitz，一家著名的风险投资公司）的Anne做过一期节目，我认为她非常出色地提供了我开始称之为“第3到第193个国家”的视角。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
If the US and China are one and two, three through there's a big gap. you know there's like I think the US is still ahead but not by that much in terms of research and you know ideas relative to China.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果美国和中国是第一和第二，那么从第三名开始就有一个巨大的差距。你知道，我认为美国在研究和理念方面仍然领先，但相对于中国来说，优势并不那么大。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
We do have this compute advantage and that does seem like it matters. One of the upshots may be that they're open sourcing and countries 3 through 93 are like or 3 through 193 are significantly behind.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们确实拥有计算优势，这似乎很重要。一个可能的结果是，他们正在开源，而第3到第93个国家，或者说第3到第193个国家，都远远落后。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, so for them it's a way to, you know, try to bring more countries over to the Chinese camp potentially in the US China rivalry.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以对他们来说，这是一种方式，你知道，在中美竞争中，可能将更多国家拉拢到中国阵营。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Seems like the model everybody and I don't like this at all. I I I don't like **technology decoupling** (Technology Decoupling: 指不同国家或地区在技术领域相互分离，限制技术交流和合作的现象) as somebody who worries about, you know, who's the real other here.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 看起来所有人都遵循这个模式，我一点也不喜欢。我担心，你知道，谁是真正的“他者”，所以我不喜欢**技术脱钩**（Technology Decoupling: 指不同国家或地区在技术领域相互分离，限制技术交流和合作的现象）。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I always say the the real other are the AIs, not the Chinese. So, if we do end up in a situation where yikes, like, you know, we're seeing some crazy things, it would be really nice if we were on basically the same technology paradigm to the degree that we really decouple and, you know, not just the chips are different, but maybe the ideas start to become very different, publishing gets shut down, you know, tech tech trees evolve and and kind of grow apart.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我总是说，真正的“他者”是AI，而不是中国人。所以，如果我们最终陷入一个可怕的境地，比如说，我们看到了某些疯狂的事情，那么如果我们基本上处于相同的技术范式，那将是非常好的。这种脱钩的程度会使得，你知道，不仅仅是芯片不同，可能连思想也开始变得非常不同，出版物被关闭，你知道，技术树各自演化并逐渐分离。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, that to me seems like a recipe for you know, it's harder to know what the other side has. It's harder to trust one another. It seems to feed into the **arms race dynamic** (Arms Race Dynamic: 指各国在军事技术或战略能力上相互竞争，导致军备不断升级的局面), which I do think would, you know, is is a real uh existential risk factor.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，在我看来，那就像是，你知道，一个导致更难了解对方拥有什么、更难相互信任的方案。这似乎助长了**军备竞赛动态**（Arms Race Dynamic: 指各国在军事技术或战略能力上相互竞争，导致军备不断升级的局面），我确实认为这会是一个真正的**生存风险**（Existential Risk: 指可能导致人类文明毁灭或永久性停滞的风险）因素。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I would hate to see us, you know, create another sort of **MAD** (Mutually Assured Destruction: 相互保证毁灭，指核武器时代各国均拥有足够能力摧毁对方，从而达到战略平衡和避免战争的理论) type dynamic where we all live under the threat of AI destruction.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我不希望看到我们，你知道，创造另一种类似**相互保证毁灭**（MAD: Mutually Assured Destruction: 相互保证毁灭，指核武器时代各国均拥有足够能力摧毁对方，从而达到战略平衡和避免战争的理论）的动态，让所有人都生活在AI毁灭的威胁之下。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but that very well could happen. And so, yeah, I don't know. I I I do kind of um have some sympathy for the recent decision that the administration made to be willing to sell the **H20s** (H20: 英伟达为中国市场定制的AI芯片，性能受限以符合美国出口管制) to China.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但这很有可能发生。所以，是的，我不知道。我确实对政府最近决定愿意向中国出售**H20芯片**（H20: 英伟达为中国市场定制的AI芯片，性能受限以符合美国出口管制）抱有一些同情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And then it was funny that they turned around and rejected them, which to me seemed like a mistake. I don't know why they would be rejecting them.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后有趣的是，他们转头又拒绝了，这在我看来是个错误。我不知道他们为什么要拒绝。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
If I were them, I would buy them. Um and I would maybe I would maybe sell inference on the models that I've just been uh creating and I would try to make my money back doing that.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 如果我是他们，我会买下它们。嗯，我可能会将我刚刚创建的模型进行推理服务，并尝试通过这种方式赚回成本。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
But in the meantime, they can at least, you know, demonstrate the greatness of the Chinese nation by showing that they're not uh far behind the frontier.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 但与此同时，他们至少可以，你知道，通过展示他们并未远远落后于前沿，来证明中华民族的伟大。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And they can also make a pretty powerful appeal to countries 3 through 193 and say like, you know, look, you really want to, you see how the US is acting uh in general, you know, you really want to they cut us off from chips.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 他们还可以向第3到第193个国家发出一个相当有力的呼吁，说：“你知道，看，你们真的想，你们看到了美国通常是如何行事的，你知道，你们真的想，他们切断了我们芯片供应。”

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Uh they had a even a long, you know, the last administration had an even longer list of countries that couldn't get chips. this administration is doing all kinds of crazy stuff.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，他们甚至有一个更长的，你知道，上一届政府有一个更长的国家名单，这些国家无法获得芯片。本届政府正在做各种疯狂的事情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, you get 50% tariffs here, there, whatever. Um, how do you know you can really rely on them to continue to provide you AI into the future?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，这里那里都有50%的关税，诸如此类。嗯，你如何知道你真的能依靠他们未来持续为你提供AI呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Well, you can rely on us. We open sourced the model. You can have it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，你可以依靠我们。我们开源了模型。你可以拥有它。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, so, you know, come work with us and buy our chips because, by the way, our models will, you know, as we mature, they'll be optimized to run on our chips.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以，你知道，来和我们合作，购买我们的芯片，因为，顺便说一下，我们的模型，你知道，随着我们成熟，它们会优化以在我们的芯片上运行。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So, I don't know. That's a complicated stuff, a complicated situation.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，我不知道。这是复杂的事情，复杂的局面。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I do think it's true. I I don't think the adoption is as high as that 80%. I think that is, you know, within that subset of companies that are doing stuff with open source.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我确实认为这是真的。我不认为采用率高达80%。我认为这只是，你知道，在那些使用开源技术的公司子集中。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
We're going to experiment with that at Wemark, but we to be honest, we have never done anything with an open source model in our product to present.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们将在Wemark尝试这一点，但说实话，到目前为止，我们的产品中从未做过任何与开源模型相关的事情。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Everything we've ever done has been through commercial. Um, at this point, we are going to try doing some reinforcement fine-tuning. We are going to do that on a Quen model, I think, first.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 我们所做的一切都是通过商业模式。嗯，目前，我们打算尝试进行一些强化微调。我想我们首先会在一个**Qwen**（Qwen: 阿里巴巴开发的开源大型语言模型系列）模型上进行。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, so you know, that'll put us in that 80%. But I'm guessing that at the end of the day, we'll take that Quinn model, we'll do the reinforcement fine-tuning, and we'll probably get roughly up to as good as, you know, GBD5 or Cloud 4 or whatever.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以，你知道，那会让我们进入那80%的行列。但我猜测，到头来，我们会使用那个Qwen模型，进行强化微调，然后我们可能会达到和GPT-5或Claude 4差不多的水平。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And then we'll say, okay, do we really want to have to manage inference ourself? How much are we really going to save?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 然后我们会说，好吧，我们真的想自己管理推理吗？我们到底能节省多少？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And at the end of the day, I would guess we probably are still going to end up just being like, eh, we'll pay a little bit more on a monthly bill basis for one of these Frontier models.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 归根结底，我猜我们最终可能还是会说，嗯，我们每月多付一点钱给这些前沿模型吧。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
They're a little bit better maybe still. And, you know, it's operationally a lot easier and they'll have upgrades, you know.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 它们可能仍然稍微好一点。而且，你知道，操作上要容易得多，而且它们还会升级，你知道的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, so yeah, I mean, of course, there's regulated industries. There's all there's a lot of places where, you know, you have hard constraints.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，所以，是的，我的意思是，当然，还有**受监管行业**（Regulated Industries: 受政府法规严格约束的行业，如金融、医疗等）。有很多地方，你知道，你面临着严格的限制。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You just can't get around and that forces you to do those Chinese thing, Chinese models. Then there's also going to be the question of like are there **back doors** (Back Doors: 在计算机系统中，指绕过正常安全认证机制，允许未经授权访问的隐藏方法或漏洞) in them?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你根本无法绕过，那迫使你使用那些中国产品，中国模型。然后还会有一个问题，比如它们里面是否有**后门**（Back Doors: 在计算机系统中，指绕过正常安全认证机制，允许未经授权访问的隐藏方法或漏洞）？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um you know people have seen the **sleeper agents** (Sleeper Agents: 指AI模型被秘密编程，在特定条件或时间点触发恶意行为) project where a model was trained to be good up until a certain point of time and you know people put the today's date in the system prompt all the time right today's date is this you are clawed you know here you go so then that's going to be another kind of thing for people to worry about um and we don't really have great there there have been some studies anthropic did a thing where they trained models to have some hidden objectives and then challenged teams to figure out what those hidden objectives were.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，你知道，人们已经看到了**“潜伏代理”**（Sleeper Agents: 指AI模型被秘密编程，在特定条件或时间点触发恶意行为）项目，其中一个模型被训练成在特定时间点之前表现良好，而人们总是会在系统提示中加入今天的日期，对吧，今天的日期是这个，你是Claude，你知道，就这样。所以那将是人们需要担心的另一种事情。嗯，我们并没有很好的解决方案，有一些研究，Anthropic做了一件事，他们训练模型拥有一些隐藏目标，然后挑战团队找出这些隐藏目标是什么。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
And with certain **interpretability techniques** (Interpretability Techniques: 用于理解和解释AI模型内部工作原理、决策过程以及预测依据的方法), they were able to figure that stuff out relatively quickly.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 借助某些**可解释性技术**（Interpretability Techniques: 用于理解和解释AI模型内部工作原理、决策过程以及预测依据的方法），他们能够相对快速地找出这些问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So you might be able to get enough confidence that you take this open source thing you know created by some Chinese company whatever and then put it through you know some sort of not exactly audit because you can't trace exa exactly what's happening but some sort of examination you know to see can we detect any hidden goals or any you know secret back door bad behavior whatevers and maybe with enough of that kind of work you could be confident that you don't have it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以你可能可以获得足够的信心，来使用这个由某个中国公司创建的开源项目，然后对其进行某种非审计性质的检查——因为你无法精确追溯到底发生了什么——而是某种形式的审查，看看我们能否检测到任何隐藏目标或任何秘密后门、不良行为等等。也许通过足够多的这类工作，你可以确信它没有这些问题。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, but the more and more critical this stuff gets, you know, again, going back to that task length doubling, weird behavior, now you got to add into the mix, what if they intentionally programmed it to do certain bad things under certain, you know, rare circumstances.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，但这些东西越发关键，你知道，再次回到任务长度翻倍、奇怪行为的问题，现在你还得考虑，万一它们在某些罕见情况下被故意编程去做某些坏事呢？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um, we're just headed for a really weird future. You know, that we've got all these there's there's no limit to it.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我们正走向一个非常奇怪的未来。你知道，我们面临着所有这些，这是没有止境的。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, all these things are valid concerns. they often are in direct tension with each other.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 你知道，所有这些都是合理的担忧。它们常常彼此直接冲突。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Um I don't I I'm not one who uh you know wants to see one tech company take over the world by any means. So I I definitely think we would do really well to have some sort of broader more buffered ecological like system where you know all the AIs are kind of in some sort of competition you know mutual coexistence with each other but we don't really know what that looks like and we don't really know um you know we don't really know what an **invasive species** (Invasive Species: 指引入非本土生态系统并对其造成负面影响的物种) might look like you know when it gets introduced into that very you know nent and as yet like not battle tested uh ecology.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 嗯，我不是那种，你知道，希望看到一家科技公司以任何方式掌控世界的人。所以我绝对认为，如果能有一个更广泛、更具缓冲性的生态系统，让所有AI都在某种竞争中相互共存，那会非常好。但我们并不真正知道那会是什么样子，我们也不真正知道，嗯，你知道，当一个**入侵物种**（Invasive Species: 指引入非本土生态系统并对其造成负面影响的物种）被引入到那个非常稚嫩且尚未经过实战考验的生态系统中时，它会是什么样子。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
So yeah, I don't know. Bottom line, I think the future's gonna be really, really weird.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 所以，是的，我不知道。总而言之，我认为未来将非常非常奇怪。

### 积极展望与广泛参与：塑造AI未来

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. Well, I I do want to close on a on a uplifting note. So maybe maybe as a as a gearing to closing question, we could get into some areas where we're already seeing some some exciting capabilities emerge and sort of transform the experience.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 是的。嗯，我确实想以一个令人振奋的音符结束。所以，也许作为一个接近结束的问题，我们可以探讨一些我们已经看到一些令人兴奋的能力出现并改变体验的领域。

Maybe maybe around education or or healthcare or any other areas you want to you want to highlight?

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Host: 也许是在教育或医疗保健领域，或者你还想强调其他任何领域？

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah, it's boy, it's all over. Um, one of my mantras is that there's never been a t better time to be a motivated learner.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是的，天哪，它无处不在。嗯，我的口头禅之一是：现在是成为一个**有动力的学习者**（Motivated Learner: 指对学习充满热情和积极性，主动寻求知识和技能提升的人）最好的时代。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Yeah. So, I I think a lot of these things do have kind of, you know, two sides of the coin.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
Nathan: 是的。所以，我认为很多事情都像硬币的两面。

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
There's the worry that the students are taking the shortcuts and they're, you know, losing the ability to sustain focus and endure cognitive strain.

这里是对应的、高质量的中文翻译。
