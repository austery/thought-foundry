### 技术浪潮的序幕

当你将技术民主化，并将其交到几乎每个人手中时，你就赋予了每个人力量。人工智能将是这十年中最重大的事件。我想说，我们在以各种方式利用机器学习与世界连接方面，才刚刚起步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you democratize technology and you put it in the hands of almost everybody, you empower everyone. AI is going to be the biggest thing in this decade. I would say we are at the very, very beginning of using machine learning really in every way in which we connect with the world.</p>
</details>

我从事半导体行业超过30年，曾经有一段时间，没人知道半导体是什么。但今天，我想每个人至少都认识到，半导体和芯片可以为无数事物提供动力。我认为这只是赛前热身。我们才刚刚进入更有趣的阶段，技术将在推动世界前进中扮演更重要的角色。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I've been in the semiconductor industry over 30 years and there were times when nobody knew what a semiconductor was. But today I think everybody at least appreciates that semiconductors and chips can help power numerous things. I think it's just a pregame show. I think we're just getting to the more interesting part where technology is going to have a much bigger role in progressing the world forward.</p>
</details>

人工智能的潜在价值在于能够加速我们的学习周期，在某种程度上就是加速研发。例如，Willow 芯片能够在不到5分钟内处理一项计算，而这项计算在当今地球上最好的超级计算机上需要10的22次方年才能完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The potential value of AI is to be able to accelerate our learning cycle. So in some way accelerate R&D. So the willow chip is able to handle a computation in less than 5 minutes that previously on the best supercomputers on the planet today would take 10 septillion years.</p>
</details>

云的本质是让各种规模、各种类型的公司都能以一种感觉上无限且无特定地点的方式运行其所有基础设施。我知道一个事实，那就是不存在所谓的“特许经营价值”。这意味着你每天都必须起床，并希望你所做的事情在明天依然有意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the cloud is essentially the ability for companies of all sizes, all types to run all their infrastructure in a way that feels infinite and like it has no specific place. I know that for a fact that there's no such thing as a franchise value. And so that means every day you have to get up and hopefully you're doing things that are going to be relevant tomorrow.</p>
</details>

我们正在努力的方向是看技术将我们引向何方，将其部署到世界中，以真正了解人们如何使用它，风险在哪里，益处在哪里，人们想要什么，他们希望它如何演变，然后让技术与社会共同进化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we're trying to do is see where the technology takes us, deploy it into the world to actually understand how people are using it, where the risks are, where the benefits are, what people want, how they'd like it to evolve, and then sort of co-evolve the technology with society.</p>
</details>

</details>

作为一家投资公司，我们看到技术与投资之间的界限正变得越来越模糊，越来越一体化，这给了我们很多机会。所以今天，我们将谈谈我们正在做的一些事情，并与大家分享。之后会有一个社交活动，以便我们能更好地相互了解。再次热烈欢迎各位的到来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We see that as an investment firm that lines between technology and investments are becoming more and more blurred, more and more integrated and that gives us a lot of opportunities. So today we are going to talk a bit about what we are doing and sharing with you and then we're going to have a social event afterwards so we can get to know each other. So again warm welcome to all of you.</p>

### 从外包到云原生：NBIM 的技术转型之旅

在 NBIM，技术是一个关键的焦点领域，它不仅仅是员工的支持功能，更是一个战略性的赋能者。我们一直在探索技术如何能改善我们投资团队的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At MBIM, technology is a key area of focus, not just as a support function for our employees, but as a strategic enabler. We are constantly looking at how technology can improve the experiences for our investment teams.</p>
</details>

多年来，NBIM 经历了一段重大的技术旅程，从完全外包的运营模式转变为现代化的**云原生**（Cloud-native: 一种在云环境中构建和运行应用程序的方法）环境。在接下来的几分钟里，我将带大家回顾这段旅程，正是这段旅程使我们今晚将要看到的一切成为可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MBIM has been through over the years a significant technology journey from fully outsourced operations to a modern cloudnative environment. In the next few moments, I'm going to take you through this journey, a journey that made it possible to do all the stuff that you're going to see this evening.</p>
</details>

在2017年之前，我们所有的技术都是完全外包的。我们在阿姆斯特丹有两个数据中心。之所以有两个，纯粹是为了冗余，以防其中一个宕机。但这种设置给我们带来了一些挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before 2017, all of our technology was fully outsourced. We had two data centers in Amsterdam. And the reason why we had two was simply because of redundancy in case of one of them went down. But this setup did give us some challenges.</p>
</details>

我们甚至有过这样的故事：一位顾问不得不亲自飞到阿姆斯特丹，连接到宕机的驱动器上，才能让它们重新启动。这意味着我们必须自己维护一切，从数据中心之间的复制到维护，再到发生停机时的修复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had we had even a story about a consultant that had to physically go to Amsterdam and connect to the drivers when they were down to get them back up again. So that meant that we had to maintain everything ourselves from replication between the data centers to maintenance and when maintenance and fixed when downtime occurred.</p>
</details>

采购也有问题。像更换磁盘这样简单的事情，由于供应链的延误可能会花费数月时间。简而言之，我们必须自己处理基础设施的方方面面，从运营的角度来看，这远非理想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Procurement also had its problems. Something as simple as replacing discs could take months due to delays in the supply chain. So in short, we had to handle every aspect of the infrastructure on our ourselves and this from an operational standpoint was far from ideal.</p>
</details>

因此，在2017年，我们启动了 ISAC 项目，这是我们技术征程中的一个重要项目。它聚焦于四大支柱：
1.  **内部化 (Insourcing)**：我们希望将最优秀的人才留在内部，并建立内部专业知识，而不是严重依赖顾问。
2.  **安全 (Security)**：我们专注于加强我们的安全态势，这是整个组织的重中之重。
3.  **自动化 (Automation)**：由于内部开发人员比顾问少，我们知道自动化至关重要。因此，**基础设施即代码**（Infrastructure as Code: 使用代码来管理和配置基础设施）成为提高效率的核心部分。
4.  **云 (Cloud)**：我们全力投入云端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in 2017 we launched the ISAC project a project that was significant in our technology journey. It focused on four key pillars. Insourcing we wanted the best talent inhouse and build internal expertise rather than relying on heavily on consultants. security. We focused on strengthening our security posture which was top priority across the entire organization. Automation with fewer in-house developers than consultants. We knew that automation was essential. So infrastructure as code became a core part of increasing efficiency. Lastly, cloud. We went all in on the cloud.</p>
</details>

强大的内部支持最终让我们选择了 **AWS**（Amazon Web Services：亚马逊提供的云计算服务）作为我们的云提供商。我们于2018年开始向 AWS 迁移，到2019年，这一转型宣告完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Strong internal support ended up with us choosing AWS as our cloud provider and we started our migration to AWS in 2018 and by 2019 this transformation was complete.</p>
</details>

从2017年到现在，NBIM 已经建立了一个现代化的开发环境。这个环境使我们的开发人员能够快速、高效地为我们的投资团队交付功能。我们的设置赋予了开发人员所需的工具、自主权和支持，让他们能够在不牺牲质量和安全的前提下快速行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So between 2017 and now MBM has built a modern development environment. An environment that allows our developers to deliver features to our investment teams quickly and efficiently. We have a setup that gives developers the tools, the autonomy, and the support they need to do this fast without compromising quality and security.</p>
</details>

至关重要的是，所有这一切都离不开我们领导团队的强力支持。在他们推动“云优先”战略下，我们现在已经为创新奠定了基础。这使我们能够测试像人工智能这样的新型先进技术。我们正在将人工智能融入我们的日常工作中，以简化流程、提高生产力并做出更明智的决策。所以今天，你们将看到我们因此能够构建出的所有酷炫的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Crucially, all of this has only been possible due to strong support from our leadership group. With their push on a cloud first strategy, we now have created foundation for innovation. This has made it possible for us to test new advanced technologies such as AI. We are integrating AI in our daily life to streamline processes to boost our productivity and to make smarter decision. So today you will see all the cool stuff that we have been able to build as a result of this.</p>
</details>

### Pilates 平台：驾驭万亿资金的复杂性

我们利用这个平台所做的一件事就是构建了这个内部投资平台。我们的原则是，能买则买，但必须自建时，我们就会自建——当我们的需求是如此特定和独特，以至于没有人能为我们提供所需的软件时。这也是我大部分时间都在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the things that we have used this platform for is to build this internal investment platform. So we buy when we can we buy software when we can but we build when we have to when our requirements are so specific and unique that nobody can deliver us the software that we need. So this is also what I spend most of my time on.</p>
</details>

现在，为了展示这个系统，我们将请我们的 **UX/UI**（User Experience/User Interface：用户体验/用户界面）设计师 Helena Stavo 来介绍我们的内部系统，她的演讲题目是“通过巨额数字的负担来管理复杂性”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now to present this we will have our UX UI designer Helena Stavo present our internal system in a presentation she has she has called managing complexity through the burden of really big numbers. Helena</p>
</details>

大家好，很高兴见到你们。我一直很兴奋能告诉你们我整天都在做什么，每天都在想什么，甚至晚上睡觉时都在思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hello everyone. So nice to see all of you. I've been really excited to tell you about what I'm working on all day, every day, thinking about when I sleep at night and all of that.</p>
</details>

1996年，发生了两件非常重要的事情。我出生了，以及第一笔19亿挪威克朗的存款存入了基金账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1996, two very important things happened. I was born and the first first deposit was made into the account of 1.9 billion Norwegian croners.</p>
</details>

大家都知道，今天这个数字已经非常庞大。它实际上是……有人能读出这个数字吗？举手。在我第一次来这里面试之前，我坐下来研究了这个数字，因为我想“万一他们问我这个数字是多少呢？” 这个数字是19万亿挪威克朗。这个数字太大了，你很难真正理解它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As you all know that number is huge today. It is so much more. It is actually Can you read this? Can anybody read this? Hands up. I actually before I had my first interview here, I sat down and studied this number because I was like what if they ask me what this number is? So this is 19,000 billion Norwegian croners. which is so huge that you can't really understand it.</p>
</details>

所以我做了一些小的可视化来帮助大家理解。如果我们用挪威的1克朗硬币铺满整个地面会怎样？假设我们卖掉所有资产，拥有19万亿挪威克朗的硬币铺在地上。那么你走到哪里，脚下踩的都是钱。这片区域的面积，差不多可以让你从奥斯陆走到卑尔根，一路都走在钱上。这很蠢，所以我想我们不会这么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I've made some small visualizations here to maybe make you understand it. What if we were to cover the entire ground with Norwegian one croners? So we were to sell all of our assets and have 19,000 billion Norwegian croners on the ground. So everywhere you walked you would step on money basically. That would cover this area. So, you could almost work to walk to Bergen from Oslo and walk on money, which is pretty stupid. So, I don't think we're gonna do that.</p>
</details>

或者，我们可以把这些钱堆叠起来，也许能赢得太空竞赛。如果我们爬到这堆钱的顶上，它将带我们进入太空3300万公里，超越金星，这也相当疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or we could stack this money on top of each other and maybe win the space race if we were to climb on top of this money because that would take us 33 million kilometers into space reaching beyond Venus, which is also pretty crazy.</p>
</details>

数字本身很大，但这里的日常运营规模也同样巨大。每天，NBIM 内部的交易额达到4.5亿克朗。这比奥斯陆证券交易所每天的交易额还多，相当于我们每天处理国家预算的四分之一。太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the number itself is big but the daily operations here are also incredibly enormous in size. So each day we have transactions going through the walls at embim of 450 million croners. That is more than is traded at version every single day and it is a fourth of the state budget that we handle here every single day. Crazy.</p>
</details>

让事情更复杂的是，大多数投资公司只专注于一个投资组合，但 NBIM 作为一个整体就是一个投资组合。我们希望 NBIM 内部的所有子投资组合都表现出色。NBIM 被划分为许多不同的投资组合，原因有几个：我们有不同的投资和资产类别，我们有不同的行业希望表现良好等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What makes this even more complex is that some or most investment firms focus on one portfolio but NBIM as a whole is one portfolio. We want all sub portfolios at NBIM to be doing or performing great. So NBIM is divided into a lot of different portfolios for several reasons. We have different investment and asset classes. we have different sectors we want to be performing well in etc.</p>
</details>

为了追踪这一切，拥有一个全局概览，了解每个人都在哪里投资，变得非常重要。这意味着，如果我是一个投资组合经理，想买入 Rose 公司的股票，我会先在内部查询是否有 NBIM 的其他人想卖出 Rose 公司的股票。这种情况经常发生。我们在这里有不同的职责，有时你想卖出某样东西，而你的同事却想买入。拥有这种全局概览实际上为我们节省了大量资金，我们说的是数十亿。这使得 NBIM 成为你从未听说过的最大市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to try to keep track of this it's very important to have an overview of where everybody is investing. This can mean that if I was a portfolio manager for example wanting to buy stocks in Rose Company Co. Then I would check internally first if there was somebody else in NVIM wanting to sell something in Rose Company Co. because this happens a lot. We have different responsibilities here that sometimes you would want to sell something when your colleague would want to buy something. Doing this and having an overview of this actually saves us a lot of money. We're speaking billions here. We usually are speaking billions here but and it makes NBIM the biggest marketplace that you have never heard of.</p>
</details>

所有这些我们都必须在某个地方进行管理，其中一个地方就是 **Pilates**。Pilates 是我每天都在工作的项目，它是 NBIM 用于投资组合管理和交易的主要平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of this we have to manage somewhere and one of the places we are managing this is in Pulis. Pulis is what I work on every day and that is NBIM's main platform for portfolio management and trading.</p>
</details>

在有 Pilates 之前，我们有大量的不同工具。在 NBIM 工作非常酷的一点是，每个人都非常聪明。开始在这里工作时，意识到每个人对所有事情都了解很多，这有点令人望而生畏，但这真的很酷。我们有不少投资组合经理和交易员自己会编程，制作支持性应用程序。结果就是，我们有很多不同的应用程序需要维护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we had Pilates, we had a ton of different tools. What is really, really cool about working here at MBIM is that everyone is incredibly smart. It's kind of daunting to start working here and realizing that everybody knows a lot about everything, which is really cool. So, we have quite a few portfolio managers and traders that code themselves and make supporting applications. And we have in return, we have a lot of different applications that needs to be maintained.</p>
</details>

NBIM 的另一个特别之处在于，我们的人数并没有你想象的那么多。我们管理着巨额资金，但实际管理的人并不多。结果就是，每个人都有非常、非常具体的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is also very particular about MBM is that we are not that many people that you might think. So we have a lot of money but there are not that many people that actually manage this. So what ends up happening is that each person has very, very very specific needs.</p>
</details>

那么，我们如何将所有这些不同的应用程序整合到一个平台中，同时为每个使用它的人保持速度和灵活性呢？速度是这里的关键词，因为一次点击就价值不菲。如果你花太多时间到达某个地方，那可能是一件非常糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how do we take all of these different applications and consolidate them into one platform while still keeping the speed and agility for each person that uses it? And speed is the key word here because one click again is worth a lot of money. So, if you spend too much time getting somewhere then that might be a very bad thing.</p>
</details>

这就是 Pilates。Pilates 不仅仅是你所看到的，它背后还有大量的工作。Pilates 包含一个后端，允许开发人员直接在后端构建自己的节点和端点，以便在一个通用的协作平台上构建前端应用程序或报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. So, this is Pilates. Pilates is not just what you see, but it is a lot of work that lies behind the application that I will of course show you afterwards. Pilates consists of a backend that lets developers build their own nodes and endpoints directly into the back end to build front-end applications and or reports directly into one common and collaborative platform.</p>
</details>

这对用户的一个关键好处是，我们将所有核心系统都整合到同一个后端，这反过来又让我们的用户使用起来容易得多，因为他们不再需要进入多个不同的应用程序来执行日常操作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is a really key user benefit for this is that we pull all core systems into the same backend which again in return makes it a lot easier for our users to use because they no longer have to go into several different applications to perform everyday actions.</p>
</details>

然后，在此之上，我们有应用程序本身，它是利用用户体验和业务知识构建的，这对于可扩展性来说非常非常重要。如果我们向前看，并尝试将平台视为一个整体，那么拥有一个能够持续多年的平台就会容易得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then on top of that we have the application itself which is built using UX and business knowledge which again is very, very important for scalability reasons. If we think ahead and try to look at the platform as a whole it's a lot easier to have a platform that will live on for many years to come.</p>
</details>

我们所有东西都是内部构建的，这一点非常非常重要。我们不像任何其他投资公司。能够控制整个过程至关重要，在这里我们实际上控制着一切。所以左上角的关闭图标可以是一个笑脸，也许是一个悲伤的笑脸，表示“你现在要关闭我了吗？” 是的，我们控制着一切，这让我们能做很多很酷的事情。Pilates 的主要特点是灵活性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are building everything inhouse and that is very, very, very important. We are not like any other investment firm. It's super important that we can control the entire process and here we actually control absolutely everything. So the close icon in the top left corner could be a smiley face, maybe a sad smiley face. Are you closing me now? Um yes. So we are controlling absolutely everything and that lets us do a lot of cool things. The main feature of Pilates is flexibility.</p>
</details>

使用 Pilates 的每个人，我们都和他们很熟。所以我确切地知道每个人想要什么，他们也能在 Pilates 中得到他们想要的东西。以前我们有很多静态表格等，但现在他们能够构建自己的用户界面，并拖入他们可以根据自己喜好重新排列的组件，在需要时准确地看到他们需要的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Each person that uses Pilates we're on firstname basis with everyone really. So I know exactly what each person wants and they are able to get exactly that in Pilates. Previously we had a lot of static tables etc. But now they're able to build their own user interface and pull in components that they can then rearrange as they would like and see exactly what they need when they need it.</p>
</details>

所有这些组件都监听一个数据通道，我们在这里预先筛选他们看到的数据。这使得我们为他们提供一个稳定可靠的平台变得容易得多，因为我们不会预先给他们所有东西。我们对 Pilates 平台进行了一次重构，以前加载最大的投资组合非常困难，会完全卡住。这并不奇怪，因为主投资组合有超过15,000行。所以加载所有这些数据很困难是有道理的。但现在我们能够筛选数据，从而提供一些速度和灵活性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of these components then listen into a data channel where we prefilter the data that they see. This makes it a lot easier for them to actually have a stable and reliable platform or for us to give them a stable and reliable platform because we don't give them everything up front. We have had a rework of the prolitus platform and previously it was very difficult to load the biggest portfolios. It would stop completely and it's not that weird because the main portfolio has over 15,000 rows. So that sort of makes sense that it's difficult to load all of that data. But now we're able to filter that out and provide some speed and agility there.</p>
</details>

但不仅是布局本身是灵活的，我们还使数据本身变得灵活，这样用户就可以构建自己的报告，并根据自己的喜好混合和匹配列和数据。以前，这是一个非常手动的过程，开发人员必须介入为投资组合经理和交易员构建表格、图表或其他任何东西。而现在，很快他们将能够自己完成所有事情，并根据自己的喜好拖放数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's not only the layout itself that is flexible. We are also making the data itself flexible so that users can build their own reports and mix and match columns and data as they would like. before. Now we've had a very manual process where a developer would have to go in and build a table or a graph or whatever it may be for the for the portfolio managers and traders. Whereas now very soon they will be able to do absolutely everything themselves and pull and drag and drop data as they would like as well.</p>
</details>

我将给你们一个非常快速的演示，展示一个普通的投资组合经理如何在 Pilates 中度过他们的时间。这是一个草图，因为不幸的是，我现在不能向你们展示真实的东西。所以不要根据这个来做投资，因为你会非常失望的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to give you a very quick demo of how a normal person or a normal portfolio manager would spend their time in Pilates. This is a sketch because I'm not allowed to show you the real deal from right now unfortunately. So don't base your investments on this because you will be very disappointed.</p>
</details>

这是一个投资组合表格概览。这是我们为投资组合经理制作的一个预设。大多数人使用它是为了清楚地了解自己的持仓情况。所以，它们今天在哪里？与基准相比如何？因为这是每个人都在关注的。我离基准是近还是远？

<p class="english-text">Okay. So, this is the portfolio table overview. It's a preset that we have made for the portfolio managers. And what most of them use this for is to get a good grip of what are my holdings. So, where are they today? Um where is it opposed to the benchmark because that's what everybody is looking towards. Am I close or far away from the benchmark?</p>
</details>

现在，这里有基准列，显示为100，然后是持仓列，显示为97。所以我们是-3，我希望把它变成0。所以我要在模拟列中输入0，然后它会自动填充下面的模拟数据。非常酷的是，它还会模拟你投资组合的其余部分。因此，投资组合经理能够建立自己的交易计划，并使用所有这些反馈回来的数据，观察这将如何改变整个投资组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, right here, this is why I have to stand up here. Now we have the benchmark column it says 100 and then we have the holdings column says 97. So we are minus3 and I want that to get to a zero. So I'm going to write zero in the in the simulations column and then it automatically populates the simulations beneath. And what is really cool about this is that it then also simulates the rest of your portfolio. So portfolio managers are able to build up their own trade programs and see how this changes the portfolio as a whole using these data that is all sent back.</p>
</details>

总结一下，我们如何管理复杂性？首先，我们必须确保我们构建的东西对每个人都适用，同时又能提供一定程度的定制化。但最重要的是，我们必须确保它是稳定和可靠的。如果用户不能信任平台或数据，我们就已经失败了。因此，拥有正确的数据结构和架构对于拥有一个能够处理所有这些复杂性的良好工作软件至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to summarize, how do we manage complexity? First and foremost, we have to make sure that we are building something that works for everyone while still being able to be a bit more customizable. But most importantly, we have to make sure that it is stable and reliable. If the users cannot trust the platform or trust the data, we have already failed. So having the correct data structure in place and architecture in place is detrimental to have a good working software to be able to handle all of this complexity.</p>
</details>

最后，是提供灵活性和可扩展性。在我们的案例中，这意味着让他们有可能基本上将 Pilates 作为一个构建模块，来创建他们自己心目中完美的投资组合和交易工具。其次，要制定原则，确保最终效果不会太差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then lastly is to be able to provide flexibility and scalability. So that would mean in our case giving them the possibility to basically use politis as a building block to create their own perfect idea of what a portfolio and trading tool should be and secondly to have principles in place for them to make it not look bad.</p>

### 巅峰对话：AI 如何重塑组织与个人

人工智能已经开始。我一生都在思考人工智能，想知道它有多难？我们如何才能实现它？现在，这种加速发展实际上让我感到惊讶。我认为它会让每个人都更富有，但我认为它对穷人的积极影响最大。对于智能的民主化尤其如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI has started. AI is the one that I've been thinking about my whole life and wondering, okay, how hard is it? How are we going to get this? Now, it's actually surprised me that we have this acceleration. I think it's going to make everybody richer, but I think it impacts positively impacts poor people the most. It should be particularly true for the democratization of intelligence.</p>
</details>

我对这一代人工智能的全部信心始于我看到从 GPT-3 到 3.5 的演变，以及它在 GitHub 中的实现。现在，ChatGPT 无疑是世界上有史以来最好的单一软件产品。这是地球上最容易使用的产品，任何人都可以使用它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My entire confidence in this generation of AI started when I started seeing from GPD 3 to 35 and that implementation in GitHub. Now, ChatGpt is unquestionably the single best software product the world's ever made. This is the easiest product to use on the planet. anybody's anybody could use it.</p>
</details>

好的，现在我们将进行一场关于人工智能的小组辩论。我们打算从几个不同的角度来讨论这个问题。我们将从组织层面开始，然后深入到个人层面。希望我们也能讨论一下，或者比较一下 NBIM 的努力和我们的历程与其他人的做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, now we're going to have a quick panel debate about AI and we thought we're going to discuss this from a couple of different angles. So, we're going to discuss this from an organizational level and then bring it down to the individual level afterwards. And hopefully also we can discuss a bit or or compare what MBM has done our efforts and our voyage to what other have done.</p>
</details>

为了帮助我们，我们邀请了我们的高层技术管理人员，以及几位外部专家。让我们快速介绍一下他们。我们有来自 Grit AI Studio 的 Alexandre Stansp。近二十年来，Alexander 一直在领导数字化转型，但现在他专注于使人工智能变得可及和实用。他正在用热情和决心为现实世界的问题构建真正的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And to help us with that we have invited our top technology management and also a couple of external experts to to help us with this. So let's introduce them quickly. So we have uh Alexandre Stansp. He is from grit AI studio and for nearly two decades Alexander has been leading digital transformations but now Alexander is focusing on making AI accessible and practical. So he's building real solutions to real world problems and he does that with passion and determinations which I guess is why you call the company grit.</p>
</details>

我们还有 Robert Angels 博士。他负责凯捷（Capgemini）的全球人工智能实验室。他拥有人工智能博士学位，实际上在手机出现之前就已经在从事人工智能工作了。甚至在互联网出现之前。是的，所以很久了，也比 Helena 出生得早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then we have also with us Dr. Robert Angels. He is he runs Capgeemini's global AI lab. He has a PhD in AI and he has actually worked with AI since before we had cell phones. So definitely I look forward to hear before the internet even. Yes, definitely. So a long time and before Helena was born.</p>
</details>

然后我们有 Brigittita。她是首席技术与运营官。她负责监督使我们能够管理世界上最大投资组合之一的技术基础设施。她在多家大型金融机构拥有丰富的服务技术领导经验。但这并不是 Brigittita 在这里的唯一工作。她还有另一个重要角色。她是 NBIM 的摇滚之声。当她不管理我们的技术和运营时，她是我们内部乐队 Reputational Risk 的主唱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we have Bilit here. Uh Brigittita is a chief technology and operations officer. Uh so she oversees the technology infrastructure that enables us to manage one of the largest portfolios in the world and she has solid experience from service technology leadership from various large financial institutions. But that's not the only job that Brigittita has here. She has another important role. She is the rock and roll voice of NBIM. So when she's not managing our tech and operations, she is the lead singer of our internal house band called Reputational Risk.</p>
</details>

最后但同样重要的是，我们有 Nicolai。我想五六年前，除非你对艺术或筒仓非常感兴趣，否则你可能没听说过他。但现在，作为 NBIM 的首席执行官和《In Good Company》播客的主持人，我不确定他是否真的需要介绍。你可能不知道的是，Nicolai 也是一个严肃的美食家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great. And uh last but not least, we have Nikolai. I think five six years ago, you would have to be very interested in art or silos if you had heard about him. But uh but no, I'm not sure if he really needs an introduction as the CEO of NBIM and host of the In Good Company podcast. What you might not know about uh Nikolai is that he's also a serious foodie.</p>
</details>

在第一部分，我们将更多地从组织层面来看待这个问题。让我们从离我们最近的地方开始，向你提问，Brigittita。你一直在领导我们的人工智能采纳工作。从你的职位——同时监督技术和运营——来看，你向我们组织引入人工智能工具和能力的方法是什么？也许你也可以谈谈你认为哪些方面做得很好，哪些让你感到惊讶，以及是否遇到了任何阻力或挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So in this first part um we're going to look at this more from an organizational level and uh let's start close to home with a question to you Brigittita. So you've been leading our AI adoption efforts uh but from where you sit so overseeing both technology and operations. What has been your approach to introducing a tools and capability to our organization? And also maybe you can touch upon what you think has worked well. Uh what surprised you and if you've kind of encountered any resistance or any challenges.</p>
</details>

Brigittita 回答道：总的来说，我想说在 NBIM，我们在采纳新技术方面有一种非常强大的自下而上的草根运动。所以我们总是有一些人会奔向新的机会。但是当人工智能出现时，我们意识到这东西特别强大，将带来非常大的变革。所以我们决定这次可能需要采取一些不同的做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I generally I would just say that uh in MBIM we have this like very powerful grassroot movement when it comes to adopting new technology. So we always have had people that are running uh towards new opportunities. But uh when AI came uh we kind of understood that this is particularly powerful. This is going to really make a big big change. So we decided that we probably need to do it a bit differently this time.</p>
</details>

因此，我们引入了一种更全面的自上而下的方法。我们做了很多事情。首先，我们成立了一个人工智能团队。我们认为在组织中设立一个卓越中心会很好，一个可以探索所有不断涌现的新模型的地方。我们还希望确保他们有一个好的平台，以便我们能很好地监督所有这些事情。人们可以来找他们提问，他们是推动许多倡议向前发展的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh uh we uh introduced more like a comprehensive top-down approach uh when we we started to to look at this and we've done many things. So the first thing we did was to establish an AI team and we really thought that it would be good to have a center excellence uh in the organization and a place that could explore all the new models that are coming in uh and they change all the time. uh we also wanted to make sure they had a good platform uh so that we could oversee all these things in a good way uh and and people come to them and and ask questions and they are the ones that are you know driving uh a lot of the initiatives uh forward.</p>
</details>

其次，我们决定需要一些强制性课程。所以我们制作了内部的七个模块课程，每个人都必须参加。我们相信这对组织来说非常有效，我们知道每个人至少都达到了某个最低水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um secondly we decide that we need some mandatory courses. So we've made internal uh seven module courses that everybody had to participate on uh and uh we believe that that has been very powerful for the organization and we know that everybody at least is at at some sort of level minimum level.</p>
</details>

我们还认为，组织中需要更多的人来帮助推动这项工作。因此，我们引入了一支由人工智能大使组成的队伍，他们接受了比其他人更多的培训。所以他们就像内部的顾问，可以在各个团队中提供帮助，以确保我们有足够的人员支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um we also uh thought that we need more people in the organization that can help you know drive this as a big force. So we introduced an AI ambassador force of people uh and they received more training than the others. So they are like uh inhouse consultants, smaller consultants that can help out in the various teams to make sure that we have enough people to support.</p>
</details>

我们设定了一些大胆的目标。目前，我们的目标应该是提高20%的效率。我想组织中的每个人都知道这一点，他们将自己的绩效与这个目标联系起来。所以每个人都必须做些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we set some uh bold statements on on where what we want to achieve. So currently our our um achievement should be uh 20% more efficiency uh and I think everybody knows that in the organization and they link their own performance to this goal. So everybody has to do something.</p>
</details>

我们确保与外部供应商，如 OpenAI 和 Anthropic，进行大量交流。我们引进了像 Alexander 这样的外部专家，他帮了我们很多。总而言之，我们努力确保每个人都能接触到这项技术。其中一件非常重要的事情是，我们让工具变得易于获取。我们称之为“3C”，即 Claude，一个任何人都可以使用的提示引擎，无需任何编程或类似技能。然后我们为那些需要更深入、更高级工具的开发人员使用 Cursor。当然，还有微软的 Copilot。这就是“3C”，我们一直在推动人们使用它们，我们一直在谈论它，我的意思是，一直在谈论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um we uh make sure that we talk to uh external vendors a lot like uh open AAI and anthropic. uh we have brought in external expertise like Alexander here he has helped us a lot uh so uh all in all I mean we have tried to just make sure that this is available for for everyone and one of those things that's also super important is that we make tools available easy availability to the people and for us we have called it the three C's which is a claude uh prompting uh engine that anyone can use without any kind of uh programming or um that kind of skills from before. Uh and then we use cursor for those that are more indepth developers that need more more tools uh more extravant tools and then of course uh Microsoft core pilot. So these are threec's and we really push people to use it all the time and we talk about it like all the time and I mean like all the time. I mean we are talking all the time all the time.</p>
</details>

主持人提问：Robert，通过你在凯捷的工作，你接触了欧洲各行各业的组织。刚才描述的关于人工智能采纳的情况，与你所看到的有多大的一致性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then would you talk about challenges? Um you can think about that a bit. We get them get back to you. So uh so Robert uh through your work at Capgeemini you meet with organizations across all industries across Europe. Uh how does what just described about AI adoption alignment? What do you see?</p>
</details>

Robert 回答道：情况比那更糟一点，因为我们是全球性的，所以不仅仅是欧洲。我认为我们的大多数客户也都在你们的投资名单上。我理解你说的自上而下、知识普及和赋能。这很好。但如果你看看我们服务的大型组织中那些真正成功的，这种自上而下的方式当然很重要。你需要一个真正参与、真正使用它的高层管理团队。你也需要一个不天真的高层管理团队，因为这是有风险的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a bit worse than that because we're global. So not only Europe even. Yeah. And I think most of our clients are also on your list of investments. So um but but yeah. No. So I I empathize with what we're talking English. Yeah. Yeah, I empathize with you on top down and knowledge and enablement. So that's very good. But if you look at the the big organizations that we that we serve that are really successful, uh this top down is of course important. You need a top management that is really engaged that is really using it. You also need the top management that is not naive. I mean but because this is risky business.</p>
</details>

用AI实现1%和2%的改进是很容易的。但10%、20%、30%的提升也会增加你所面临的风险状况，并非世界上所有行业都能应对。比如我们有制造飞机的公司。我可不想坐在一架基于AI提升了20%效率而制造的飞机上，至少目前不想。我就是不想。你希望飞机有两个相似的翅膀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean the one and 2% improvements they are easily to reach with AI. uh but but the 10 20 30% also increases the risk profile that you're running and not all sectors in the world actually tackle that. I mean we have companies making airplanes. Uh I don't want to sit in an airplane that is built with 20% more efficiency based on an AI at the moment. I just don't want to do that. Uh I mean you want to have two wings that are similar.</p>
</details>

问题在于它存在风险。我从互联网出现之前就开始研究人工智能，从88年开始研究认知心理学和人工智能。我一直在尝试把这个卖给像你们这样的人。然后得到的回答总是：“哦，这是科幻小说。明年再来吧。”现在情况反过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um the the thing is that that there is a risk profile on it. And when we look at it, I mean like uh like you said in the introduction, I've been working with AI really from before the internet. I started in 88 with cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence. And I've been always trying to sell this to people like you. And then the answer was like, oh, this is science fiction. Come back next year. And now it is the other way around.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，这确实是一项非常酷和有趣的技术，但我们发现有两件事做得特别好。在目前，如果你看看所有 ChatGPT 之后上市的东西，有两件事做得非常好，那就是**多模态**（Multimodality）。我一生中从未见过多模态能像现在这样好用。图片、文本、数字、声音，把它们结合起来，扔在一起。我们尝试了几十年，从未成功。现在它做得很好。我印象深刻。分析师报告、图表，把它们和文本放在一起，从中得出一些意义。这很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the the interesting thing is really that um it is a a very cool and interesting technology but we found out that there's two things that are really working well and there's at the moment I mean if you look at all this after chat GPT stuff that comes on the market there's two things that really work well and and they really work well and that is multimodality. I've never seen multimodality working in my life so good as it does now. So, pictures, text, numbers, sound, combine it, throw it together. We've tried it for decades. We never managed. It's It's working well now. I'm impressed. Analysts, reports, graphs, put them together with the text, make some sense out of it. It's good.</p>
</details>

还有**多语言性**（Multilinguality）。我从来没有一个系统能处理我的语言，因为我每天说四种语言。我有一个德国妻子，我住在挪威，我本来是荷兰人。我的孩子们说的是 TikTok 英语。所有这些语言都混在一起，而且我有很多印度同事。所以我有来自其他文化的影响，而这些模型仍然能理解我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Multilinguality. I mean, I've never had a system that could tackle my my language because I speak four languages every day. I have a German wife. I live in Norway. I'm originally Dutch. My children speak Tik Tok English. I mean, you got all these languages blended and and I have a lot of English um Indian colleagues. So, I got all these influences from other cultures and these these models still understand me.</p>
</details>

但有两件事做得不好，表现不佳，无论 Sam Altman 或 Elon 怎么说，那就是**抽象**和**逻辑推理**。它根本不存在，这些模型中没有证据表明它存在。另一件事是**上下文**和**情境感知**。只要我从事AI工作，一旦你训练好模型，并把它们放到现实世界中，一个我们人类也生活在其中的、有物理事物和效应的真实世界情境中，这些模型就无法维持足以让它们良好工作的世界模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The two things that don't work well that are underperforming no matter what some Alman or Elen are saying is really abstraction and logical reasoning it's not there there is no evidence that's in these models show me the contrary and the other thing is really context and contextual awareness I mean as long as I worked with AI as soon as you train the model and you got models read as soon as you put them in the real world in a real world context where we people are also living and there is some physical things and effects these models are not maintaining world models that let them actually work well enough.</p>
</details>

主持人提问：Alexander，从你的角度来看，你直接与组织合作，专注于这些实用的人工智能解决方案。你认为决定人工智能采纳是否能真正带来成果，而不仅仅是昂贵的试点项目的关键因素是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe I should just No, I just have wanted to bring Alexandros into this. So from your perspective working directly with organizations Alexander, so you're focusing on these practical AI solutions just getting things to work. So what's your take on this? Uh what are you seeing as the key factors that uh you know determines whether air adoption actually delivers results and not just like expensive pilot projects? Yeah,</p>
</details>

Alexander 回答道：我认为，首先，做点什么总比持观望态度要好。不幸的是，很多公司仍然抱着坐山观虎斗的心态。我担心我们会因为关于“它还没有达到我们想要的推理水平”的定义和讨论而偏离轨道。我的意思是，一年前，当我们看模型性能时，我们还处于石器时代。所以，忘了它吧。今天你不需要有神经网络的博士学位才能使用人工智能。这是与去年相比的关键区别。现在任何人都可以使用人工智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's a good question. I think uh first and foremost, I think doing something is better than having this wait and see mentality. Unfortunately, a lot of companies still have this sitting on the fence mentality. And I I'm I'm worried that we get derailed from definitions and discussions about uh well, it's not yet performing reasoning to the level that we want. I mean, a year ago, we were comparably at the stone ages when we look at the model performances. So, forget about it. You don't need a PhD in uh neural networks to use AI today. That's the key difference compared to last year. Now anyone can use AI.</p>
</details>

那么谁会成功呢？我认为，这始于解决真正的业务问题。不仅仅是说“让我们做人工智能”。它需要是战略性的。CEO 去找 IT 总监说“我们在人工智能方面做了什么？” IT 总监回答“哦，我们已经开启了 Copilot”，然后打勾了事，这没有帮助。解决“周一早上”的问题，这才是真正的价值所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So who succeeds? I think it starts with solving real business problems. It's not just saying let's do AI. It needs to be strategic. Doesn't help that the CEO goes to the IT director and say what are we doing about a AI? And the IT director says uh well uh we've turned on co-pilot. Tick the box. No. Solving Monday morning problems. That's what the real value is about, right?</p>
</details>

我认为很多失败的试点项目，是因为它们试图实现太多。所以老实说，我认为很简单。尝试快速交付，做出“足够好”的解决方案，从用户那里获得真实反馈，然后在此基础上进行迭代。我认为这样你才能得到能转化为生产力的成功试点项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think a lot of pilots that fail, they fail because they try to achieve too much. So So honestly, I think it's simple. Try to ship fast, do good enough solutions, get real feedback from users, and then iterate from there. I think that's where you get successful pilots that turn into production.</p>
</details>

主持人提问：Nicolai，在你的角色中，你会见来自世界各地的商业领袖，你认为采纳人工智能最重要的因素是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Right. Nikolai, so in your role, you you meet with business leaders from across the world, what what is your uh what do you think are the most important factors for uh adoption of AI?</p>
</details>

Nicolai 回答道：不，你需要在顶层有一个彻头彻尾的狂人。我是认真的。这是我们作为人类将经历的最重大的事情。现在发生的事情令人难以置信，因为世界上从来没有一个时期，一家公司能通过恰当部署这项技术，在一年内对另一家公司获得20%的优势，然后再一个20%，再一个20%。当你在竞争中获得50%到100%的优势时，他们将永远追不上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, you need to have a a total maniac at the top and you need to I'm I'm serious. This is just the biggest thing that we will ever experience as human beings. It's unbelievable what's going on now because I have there has never been a time in the world where one company who deploy this properly gain a 20% advantage on the other company in one year and another 20 and another 20 and you know when you have like gained 50 to 100% advantage on your competition they will never catch up.</p>
</details>

你赢，他们死。这些公司会倒闭。这可能在三年内发生。所以你不能等待任何事情。你需要在顶层成为狂人。你需要将它全面实施到你所做的一切中。你需要有大使渗透到你的公司，你需要不停地举办活动，并且是强制性的，让每个人都行动起来。这事关生死存亡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You win they die. You know these companies are out of business. And it can happen on in a threeyear time span now. So you can't wait for anything.

我最近几乎睡不着觉，因为我非常渴望我们能领先于其他人。你需要有这种心态。我上上周在加州，和比尔·盖茨聊了一个小时。他刚花了一整周时间和所有重要人物交谈，比如哈萨比斯、奥特曼，所有这些人。他只是觉得，这完全令人难以置信。我一生都在研究这个，从未见过这样的事情。速度还在不断加快。

</details>

主持人提问：如果我们把焦点从组织转向个人层面，我相信观众中很多人都在想人工智能将如何塑造他们的职业未来。回到你这里，Brigittita，作为一个同时管理技术和运营的人，人工智能正在如何改变你团队所需的技能和能力？

<details>

So as someone who manages them both technology and operations, how is AI changing the skill set and capabilities that you need in your teams?</p>
</details>

Brigittita 回答道：我想我会从改变和适应新事物的能力开始。我认为这是最重要的事情。正如 Nicolai 所说，你可以想象他从加州回来后办公室里的情景。但改变的能力，以及理解你昨天可能投入大量精力做的事情，今天可能就没有那么大价值了，我认为这是最重要的事情之一。当然，拥有一些技术背景的教育是有益的，绝对是，至少对我们这个基金来说是这样。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think I would start by saying the ability to change and adopt to something new.

<p class="english-text">I think that we will need developers. Uh of course absolutely I think that we need uh uh developers. We need data scientists. We need uh also in people that are good in investments. I mean it's just like the collaboration between the various skill sets that's important for the future. But again you have to be willing to change. You always have to be willing to embrace what's new and what's coming and that it might or will definitely impact your daily work.</p>

主持人提问：Alexander，你曾说过人工智能将把我们的表现或潜力放大10倍甚至100倍。我们应该如何准备，以确保在两三年后仍然具有相关性？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Alexander, you have uh said that AI will amplify our performance or of potential by 10 to maybe even 100 times. How should we prepare uh us here? Uh how should we prepare for being relevant in two three years from now?</p>
</details>

Alexander 回答道：我认为这非常令人兴奋，因为它关乎于赋能那些以前无法开发或解决自己问题的人。现在任何人都可以解决自己的问题了。但这并不意味着我们不需要开发人员。我认为机会空间正在急剧扩大，这意味着我们可以保持相同数量的开发人员，或者我们可以加倍，同时解决一千倍更多的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think I I I would agree with Big Git there. This is to me very exciting because it's it's about enabling and empowering people that could not develop or solve their own problems before and now anyone can solve their own problems, right? But that doesn't mean that we don't need developers. So I think like the opportunity space is just growing dramatically which means that we could keep the same number of developers or we could double and solve a thousand times more problems at the same time.</p>
</details>

但我认为，认为我们作为开发人员的工作在几年后会和现在一样，是天真的。老实说，我认为这很愚蠢。但我认为，那些拥抱它的人将有潜力成为他们自己的10倍甚至100倍版本。我们将看到更小的团队能够与那些固守传统工作方式的大团队竞争。未来的10倍开发者是那些拥抱人工智能、精通人工智能、与人工智能协作的人。他们可能部分是工程师，部分是产品思考者，部分是人工智能低语者。我认为这就是未来的超级开发者。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I think it's really naive and I know this room is probably divided. There are those that hate AI assisted coding and think it's just the worst thing that have ever happened and then others have jumped on. But I think it's naive to think that our job as developers will be the same a few years from now. I I think that's that's just stupid to be honest with you. But I think, you know, those that embrace it will have the potential to be 10x or even 100x versions of themselves. And I think we'll see that smaller teams will be able to compete with large teams that are stuck in legacy ways of working. And I think yeah, the future 10x version of a developer are those that embrace AI and become AI prolific, that collaborate with AI and uh yeah, maybe they're a part engineer, a part product thinker, and a part AI whisperer. I think that's the that's the future uh super developers.</p>

主持人提问：Robert，为什么现在有了人工智能，数据工程变得如此重要？我们一直听到数据质量和数据工程变得更加重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robert, um uh so so why is data engineering so much more important now with AI? Uh we keep hearing that right that data quality and data engineering becomes more</p>
</details>

Robert 回答道：数据工程一直都很重要。在 ChatGPT 之前，你在自己的数据上构建数据模型，然后将它们投入生产。现在我们有了全球性的基础模型，它们基本上是建立在万维网上所有可用数据之上的。如果你不知道如何很好地使用这些基础模型，并且不注入你自己的数据，那么使用它们就没有竞争优势。所以，数据工程将变得极其重要。这是你唯一的竞争优势，因为每个人都可以用相同的基础模型、相同的策略和相同的提示技巧做成千上万的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so data engineering has always been important. I mean before CH GPT you built data models on your own data and you put them in production. Now we get global foundation models that are built on basically all data that's available on the world on the worldwide web. So there's no competitive advantage in using that if you don't know how to use these foundational models well and not inject your own data into it. So to your point I mean data engineering will be extremely important. It's your only competitive advantage because everybody can do 1000 and thousand ticks with the same foundational models with the same strategies and know how to prompt.</p>
</details>

所以你需要增加额外的价值。拥有自己的数据，能够注入它，用它在自己的基础设施中构建自己的模型，这绝对是我们看到正在发生巨大且快速变化的领域。正如我们多次说过的，现在总有新事物出现，我们从 ChatGPT 到 RAG，再到 Graph RAG 等等。现在我们谈论的是**生成式AI**（Agentic AI），无论那可能意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you need to add that extra. So I and you see that so India is actually trying to build models they have 22 official languages and they're building models for most of them so that they can enable all their smart people in all these regions in their own languages. Other things are available to everybody. So having your own data available, being able to inject that, build your own models in your own infrastructures with it, that is definitely a thing that we see changing a lot and very fast at the moment and like we've said several times. So at the moment there is new things coming up all the time and we went from chat GPT to rack to graph rack to whatever. Now we're talking about the gentic AI uh whatever that might mean.</p>

主持人提问：Nicolai，我有一个有点棘手的问题要问你。这是房间里的大象：人们会因为人工智能而失业吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Nicolola, I have a bit of a tough question for you also on this. So, bring it on. Yeah. So, this is the elephant in the room. Will people lose their jobs to AI?</p>
</details>

Nicolai 回答道：当然，那些不使用人工智能的人会失业。我希望如此。在 NBIM，如果你不使用人工智能，你将永远不会被提升。因为你会远远落后于其他人。所以，你会失业吗？短期内肯定不会，我认为这都是关于提高效率等等。但在长期内，有些类型的工作将受到挑战，比如律师、会计师、工程师，所有这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, for sure the people who don't use AI will lose their jobs. I hope so. I mean, here at MBM, if you don't use uh AI, you'll be you will never be promoted, right? Uh because you will you will lag so much behind everybody else. So, um so will you lose your jobs? Um well um for sure not in the short term I think it's all about uh you know making the efficiency uh better and so on but you know in the longer term there are some uh type of jobs that will be um challenged right uh lawyers accountants uh engineers all these kind of things</p>
</details>

我认为，当我们审视我们所处的时代，白领领域将有许多类型的工作受到挑战。但同时，随着人形机器人等在明年及以后以数万、数十万计的数量进入，我们在蓝领方面也将面临挑战。所以，我们正处在一个极其有趣的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think that's that's when you look at the time we are at now you'll have uh many type of jobs which will be challenged in the white color space, but at the same time, you know, with the humanoids and so on coming in in the tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands next year and the year beyond, you know, we'll have we have challenges on the white on the blue collar side, too. So, we are um at an incredibly interesting time.</p>
</details>

主持人提问：你认为我们很快会在 NBIM 看到完全自主的数字投资组合经理吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think we'll see like here in MBM, do you think we'll see like fully autonomous digital portfolio managers anytime soon?</p>
</details>

Nicolai 回答道：不，我们从来没有任何东西是直接从人工智能到执行或交易的。中间总有一个人。所以这里所有的投资决策都是由我们做出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, we are very So, we we never have anything that goes straight from AI to execution or trade, right? there's always a human uh in between and so all the investment decisions here are being taken are being taken by us.</p>
</details>

主持人提问：关于人工智能的采纳，你们是否看到代际差异？是只有年轻人这样做，还是贯穿整个职业生涯？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just also a question to the panel about AI maybe adoption. Do you see, you know, generational differences in how people are adopting tools? Is it, you know, just the younger people who are doing this or is it throughout their careers? What's what do you panel think?</p>
</details>

Alexander 回答道：我认为年龄显然起着重要作用。我认为更多的是关于他们如何使用它。Z世代超过50%的人把它当作生活伴侣，用于任何决策，几乎不做任何决定前都会先咨询 ChatGPT。而千禧一代或婴儿潮一代可能更多地是用来改进他们确认派对的演讲稿之类的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think age has uh obviously plays a big role. I think there have been uh some surveys and statistics about this as well. I think it's maybe more about how they use it, right? So I think uh Gen C more than 50% are using it as a sort of a life partner for any decision and it's almost like they're not making any decisions without first uh uh conferring with chat GPT and I think maybe the uh the millennials and or baby boomers maybe are more in the category of uh impro starting out with improving the speech for their uh their confirmation party or something like that.</p>
</details>

Nicolai 补充道：发生的事情真的很酷。如果你想想过去十年。十年前，工作场所的英雄是谁？像我这样的老家伙。老年人是领军人物。五年前，谁是领军人物？是年轻人，那些会编程的，因为如果你会写 Python，你就像个英雄。然后所有老年人都觉得自己是失败者，而年轻人则觉得自己是英雄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's really cool what's happened. If you if if you just think about the last 10 years, 10 years ago, who were the heroes in the workplace? The old farts like me, right? The the old people. They were they were really the leading stars. Then five years ago, who were the leading stars? Well, they were the young people, right? Who could code because you needed if you could code Python, you were like a hero. So then all the other people, all the old people felt like losers and the young people, they felt like heroes.</p>
</details>

然后 ChatGPT 出现了。突然之间，情况又变了。像我这样的老年人，我们也能编程了。我们不再需要那些年轻人了。所以整个事情都颠倒了。基本上，年龄被中和了，这真的很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then Chhatt comes along. Then suddenly it's changing again. No, the old people like me, we can code, right? We don't need we don't need these people anymore. And so it's like it's upside down the whole thing. So basically age has been neutralized which is really cool.</p>
</details>

这意味着另一件事，关于中层管理者。过去，这意味着你把高层说的话传达给组织下层。现在，你也像一个根系系统。你从组织的其他地方吸收技术，并将其传递给高层。所以，中层管理者的角色在过去三年里完全改变了。你的职能完全变了。这真的很有趣。我们正在经历企业生活中的一些彻底的革命。这太有趣了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It means another thing being mid mid-level managers. In the old days it meant that you took whatever the guys at the top said and you transmitted it down through the organization. Right now you also function as a root system. You suck up the technology from uh you know from elsewhere in the organization and you transmit it to the top. So being a mid-level manager has totally changed over the last three years. I would say your function has totally changed. It's really fascinating. I mean we are living through some total revolutions now in corporate life. I mean it's so much fun.</p>

</details>

Nicolai：它正在改变你的生活。它把一切都颠倒了。投入进去，把你所有的时间都花在上面。如果你认为你没有时间真正地在人工智能上教育自己，那你就完全没搞懂。因为，你知道，我现在走进房间就说，放下你手头的一切。你现在做的事情完全不重要。去训练自己，因为现在用人工智能学习和训练自己会变得高效得多，也容易得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's start with you, Nicola. Ah, it's changing your life. It's uh upside down. It's just get in there and spend all your time on it. And and if you don't think you got time to really educate yourself on AI, you are just totally not getting it because uh you know, just leave I I come into rooms now leave everything you do. You know, it doesn't matter. It is totally unimportant what you're doing now. just train yourself because you're going to become so much more efficient and so much easier to to learn and train yourself with AI now.</p>
</details>

Robert：这可能更有趣，因为我认为你目前不需要理解人工智能，也不需要学习它。如果我看我与客户的讨论，过去四五个月我都没有讨论过技术。我们现在讨论的，特别是关于这种生成式AI，实际上是“好吧，我可以给你无限数量的员工，那么你打算做什么？你打算解决什么问题？你真正的计划是什么？”所以现在甚至不是一个人工智能战略，而是你的战略是什么，因为公司现在需要重新思考他们的整个战略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. What's your answer? Yeah, this is probably even more interesting because um I don't think you need to understand AI at the moment and you don't need to learn it and if I see my discussions with my clients, I haven't been discussing technology for last four or five months. I think what we're discussing especially with this agentic AI what we're discussing now is really okay I can give you an unlimited amount of employees so what what are you going to do what what are you going to solve what is actually your plan so now it's not even an AI strategy it is what is your strategy because companies need to rethink their whole strategy now and that that is this top- down thinking that needs to come.</p>
</details>

Alexander：我认为 NBIM 有一句话说得很好：“人工智能不会抢走你的工作，使用人工智能的人会。” 我认为这恰好点明了心态。所以，如果你现在处于职业生涯的早期，这是唯一的建议。投身其中，学会精通人工智能。我一直告诉我的孩子们，运用你的语言，那是你最大的资产。学会如何与人工智能沟通和协作，然后你将超越那些不这样做的人十年。所以这个差距只会越来越大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">How about you, Alexander? What's your I think you have a saying in NBIM AI won't take your job. Someone using AI will. And I think that's spot on the mentality.

That's your biggest asset. learn how to to communicate and collaborate with AI and then you'll leaprog 10 years uh for those who don't. So that that gap will just increase.</p>

### AI 赋能安全：自动化网络响应

接下来是安全。我想你可以想象，NBIM 对网络犯罪分子来说是一个有吸引力的目标。这意味着我们需要完全控制安全方面。幸运的是，我们拥有世界上最好的安全团队。他们中的两位今天将为你们演讲。那就是 Selena 和 Johanses，他们将谈谈我们如何运营我们的安全业务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Next up is security. And I guess you can imagine that um NBIM is an attractive um target for cyber criminals. Uh so that means that we need to have full control of the security aspect. And luckily we have the best security team in the world. And two of them are going to present for you today. That's Selena and Johanses who going to talk a little bit about how we run our security operations. Please.</p>
</details>

如果在不牺牲控制和洞察力的情况下，能够收回用于手动网络调查的时间，会怎么样？这是我们在 NBIM 提出的一个问题。今天，我和 Yan 将向你们展示人工智能如何帮助我们使这一愿景成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What if ma what if the hours used on manual cyber investigations could be reclaimed without sacrificing control and insight? This is a question that we have asked in EMBIB and today Yan and I are going to show you how AI has helped us make this vision a real reality.</p>
</details>

在 NBIM，我们有一个网络响应团队，负责运营一个24/7的安全运营中心。这意味着我们不断地监控、分析和响应威胁。这在实践中意味着什么？嗯，你可能正处于深度睡眠中，手机却因高优先级警报而嗡嗡作响。这种警报可能会让你觉得石油基金刚刚消失了。而且，我们被期望能极快地醒来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In MBIM, we have a cyber response team that run a 247 security and operation center. This means that we are constantly monitoring, analyzing, and responding to threats. What does this mean in practice? Well, you can be in deep deep deep REM sleep when your phone buzzes with a high priority alarm. This is a type of alarm that can that can make it look like the oil fund has just vanished. And let's just say it is expected that we wake up extremely fast.</p>
</details>

但有趣的地方在于，正如前面提到的，在 NBIM，我们越来越多地将人工智能引入流程中。在网络响应方面，我们不仅使用人工智能来发出警报，还用它来为警报提供上下文。那是什么意思呢？让我带你经历一个事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here is where it gets interesting because as mentioned in in MBIM we are bringing AI more and more into the loop and in cyber response we aren't just using AI to raise alarms but to contextualize them. And what does that mean? Well, let me take you through an incident.</p>
</details>

现在是周日凌晨2点，你被手机的嗡嗡声吵醒。一个高优先级的警报刚刚进入我们的监控平台。这种电话能让你的心率在你还没反应过来之前就飙升到180，但你立刻知道可能发生了不好的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is 2:00 a.m. on a Sunday and you wake up from your phone buzzing. A high priority alarm has just come in to our monitoring platform. This is the type of call that spikes your heart rate to 180 before you can even process what's going on, but you immediately know that something bad might be happening.</p>
</details>

然而，没有时间浪费。我们起床，穿好衣服，几秒钟内就到了办公桌前。我们登录，启动我们的监控平台，警报就在那里：在一部设备上检测到恶意软件。它很模糊，但又有点严重。什么恶意软件？什么设备？是横向移动吗？这只是一个误报吗？在那一刻，一切皆有可能，而我们的工作就是快速找出真相。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, no time to waste. We get up, we get dressed, and we are by our desk within seconds. We log in, we launch our monitoring platform, and there it is. Malware detected on a device. It's vague, but kind of heavy. What malware? What device? Is it a lateral movement? Is this just false alarm? In that moment, everything is a possibility and it's our job to find out fast.</p>
</details>

当我们的思绪在各种可能性中穿梭，双手在执行常规的分类步骤时，有东西正在后台工作——我们集成的 AI 机器人。这就是我们监控平台 Sentinel 中的警报。它显示“检测到恶意软件”，在右侧，你看到一个文本框，里面有一些被遮盖的信息。它包含了关键信息：发生了什么？哪个系统触发了警报？在这个案例中，它告知一份文档含有恶意代码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So while our mind goes through all the possibilities and our hands are going through the usual triage steps, something is working in the background. Our integrated AI bot. So this is the alarm in our monitoring platform Sentinel. Malware detected and on your right hand side you see a text block with some info covered over. It is not expected that you read it all but it do hold key information. What has happened? Which system has triggered and in this case it informs about a document containing malicious code.</p>
</details>

这就是我们集成的 AI 机器人发挥作用的地方。它不是给我们原始数据，而是创建一个关于它认为发生了什么的高管级别摘要。这给了我们一个叙述，一个故事情节，一些可操作的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is where our integrated AI bot comes into play. Instead of giving us raw data, it creates a executive level summary of what it believes has happened. This gives us a narrative. It gives gives us a storyline, something that's actionable.</p>
</details>

然后它会进行更深入的分析。它进行用户分析：用户是谁？用户是否被攻破？这类用户处理这类文件是否正常？接着它会查看文档：何时创建的？最后修改时间？谁在何时访问过它？它将所有这些信息生成一个导致警报发生的时间线。然后它提供调查指导：根据以往案例，推荐的下一步是什么？最后，它给出一个初步结论：它认为这是威胁还是误报？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then it goes deeper. It does a user analysis. Who is the user? Is the user compromised? Is it expected that this type of user work with this type of documents? Then it looks at the document. When was it created? When was it last modified? Who has access it and when? And it takes all of this information and generates a timeline leading up to the alarm. Then it gives investigation guidance. What are the next steps or recommended next steps based on previous cases? And lastly, it gives a tentative conclusion. Does he believe this is a threat or a false alarm?</p>
</text>

所以，我们不是从零开始，而是领先几步，有了上下文、方向和对警报更清晰的了解。但我们能相信这些信息吗？简短的回答是：可以，但在人工监督下。重要的是要记住，人工智能只是一个工具，不是最终决策者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So instead of starting from zero, we start several steps ahead with context, with direction, and a bit more clarity about the alarm. But can we trust the information? The short answer, yes, but with oversight, with human oversight. It is important to remember that an AI is just a tool. It is not a final decision maker.</p>
</details>

那么，我们的 AI 机器人到底是如何工作的呢？我会把它分解成几个关键组成部分，我认为这些是当今大多数高级 AI 应用的动力来源。首先，也许最重要的一点是所谓的 **React 循环**（React Loop）。React 循环是一个五阶段过程，大多数能够做事并对事物做出反应的 AI 工作流都遵循这个过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that is a very interesting question and I'm going to try and and break it down into a couple of key components that I would argue powers most advanced AI applications uh these days. The first and maybe the the most important thing to know about is something called the React Loop. The react loop is sort of a five-stage process that most AI workflows that are able to do stuff and can react to things follow.</p>
</details>

这个过程基本上是这样的：你有一个问题，比如“这台机器访问了哪些网站？”或者“这个用户和哪些URL通信了？”这是初始输入。然后，AI 有一系列可用的工具，它可以推理应该使用哪个工具来解决这个任务。接着，它执行其中一个工具，得到反馈，然后触发一个新的提示来分析反馈。然后它又回到思考步骤，再次迭代：“我应该调用一个新工具吗？我现在完成了吗？”它就这样迭代，直到解决任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is basically a process where you have some sort of question say what websites did this machine visit or what uh URLs did this user talk to and then that is the initial input. Then the AI has a series of tools available to it and it can reason about which one should I use, what will be helpful to try to solve this task. Then it executes one of those tools. It gets feedback and then a new prompt is triggered to basically analyze the feedback and then it flows back to the thought step again where it again sort of iterates should I call a new tool? Am I now finished? And then it basically iterates like that until it has solved the task.</p>
</details>

此外，这个 React 循环对于简单的任务效果很好，但当事情变得更复杂时，它就有问题了，尤其像安全事件。你可能开始挖掘，但可能什么也找不到。这是一个有点模糊的问题。这时 AI 往往会陷入一个死胡同，一事无成。因此，除了在 React 循环中运行，我们还有一个所谓的**多智能体架构**（multi-agent architecture）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition, this react loop works quite well for simple tasks, but it has a problem when stuff starts becoming more complex, especially for example like security incidents. They can be sort of like you start digging at stuff, but there might not really be anything to find. It's a bit of a diffuse problem. And then AI has a tendency to sort of just get stuck in a rabbit hole and not really achieve anything. So in addition to running stuff in an React loop, we also have what's called a multi- aent architecture.</p>
</details>

这基本上是我们有一堆不同的智能体，它们有自己的指令集和解决不同问题的秘诀，独立运作。然后我们有一个顶层的管理者智能体，负责生成任务并分配给子智能体。子智能体可能专门分析威胁情报，比如查看恶意域名或IP地址；或者专门查看我们的日志数据、用户或机器等等。你基本上是分而治之，每个子智能体在自己的 React 循环中运行任务，并有设定的资源使用限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is basically where we have a bunch of different agents with their own set of instructions and their own set of basically recipes on how to solve different problems operate independently. And then we have basically a top level manager agent that is tasked with generating up tasks and diving them up until to to the sub agents. And the sub aents might be for example an agent that specializes in analyzing threat intelligence stuff. So looking at like bad domains or IP addresses and other kinds of stuff. Or it might be an agent that specializes in looking at for example our log data or looking at our users or looking at machines and so on and so forth. So you basically divide and conquer the task and each of those sub aents run their task in their own react loop with sort of a set of limit of how much they are allowed to use.</p>
</details>

### 数据民主化：用自然语言探索数据丛林

我将从一个引述开始。这是一位高级管理成员告诉我的，为了保护隐私，我隐去了他的名字。他说，如果他需要数据，他会向首席投资官请求。首席投资官会把任务交给他的主管，主管会指示一位既懂数据又懂 SQL 的分析师。这位分析师会从我们的分析平台 Snowflake 中提取数据，导出到 Excel，然后通过同样的链条传回去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to start off with a quote. Uh and this is anonymized for Utron so no one will kind of recognize you based on this. But a senior management member uh told me um that if uh if he needs data he would request it from the chief investment officer. Uh the CIO will task their head. uh they will direct an analyst who knows the data and SQL uh who will uh actually extract the data from Snowflake our analytical platform who will export it into Excel uh and then send it back through the same chain.</p>
</details>

这个过程效率不高。如果他忘记了某一列、某个维度或某个筛选条件，整个循环就得重来一遍。这不是因为这位管理者不懂数据或 SQL，而是因为我们在 **Snowflake**（一个基于云的数据仓库平台）中有海量的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and this is kind of not very fast. Um and if Tron has forgotten a column or dimension or filter, it's the whole loop again. Um so and and this is not because uh Tron is not like competent within data or SQL or anything uh but it's uh due to the fact that we have immense uh amounts of data in snowflake.</p>
</details>

我们从数百个来源（API、数据库、文件、数据供应商等）提取数据。我们使用 Fivetran 将数据导入 Snowflake，在那里我们托管我们的分析平台。我们在那里存储原始数据，包括历史和实时数据。然后我们广泛使用 **DBT**（Data Build Tool：一个数据转换工具）来连接各个点，将原始数据转换为模型化数据，这些数据再被下游的 Tableau、Python、Streamlit 等多种工具消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and to put this uh in the context of our data platform we are ingesting hundreds of sources uh from APIs from uh databases from files from data vendors etc etc. Um and we use Fivetran to ingest that data into Snowflake where we host our uh analytical platform. Uh and there we store it as uh raw data both historical and live data. uh and then we use DBT extensively to connect the the dots um and transform that uh that raw data into model data uh which is then again consumed downstream by uh different tools like Tableau uh Python streaml and many more</p>
</details>

总的来说，这相当于数百个来源，数千 TB 的数据，数十万个对象。所以 Snowflake 基本上就像一个数据丛林，很难找到方向。然而，我们顶层有一个“狂人”，这很棒。我们还有一个了不起的人工智能团队，他们引入了“3C”工具，这完美地填补了数据与业务之间的鸿沟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and uh this like in in total this amounts to as I mentioned hundreds of sources we have thousands of terabytes of data uh we have hundreds of thousands of of objects. Uh so Snowflake is pretty much like a data jungle. Uh it's really difficult to kind of know your your way around. Uh however we we have like a madman on top uh which is great um and we have an amazing uh AI team who have onboarded the three C's as uh as big mentioned previously uh which is like a perfect fit for this purpose uh like closing the gap between data uh and the business.</p>

但 Claude 和这些大语言模型（LLM）有一个局限，那就是它们是基于公开可用的、过时的信息训练的。今年冬天，Anthropic 推出了**模型上下文协议**（Model Context Protocol, MCP）的概念，这实际上只是一个将 LLM 与你想要的任何东西连接起来的框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh however limitation for claude and these LMS are as you probably know uh they are trained on publicly available information and like outdated information based on which models you're using for example. Um and then as Yuan mentioned previously uh uh anthropic launched uh this winter the the concept of model context protocol which is in practice just a framework for connecting the LMS with whatever you would like.</p>
</details>

我们已经用 Python 构建了自己的 MCP 服务器，它们可以与 Snowflake、DBT、GitHub 或任何 API 对话。如果你能用 Python 做到，你就能把它做成一个 MCP。这为使用 Claude 或 Cursor 等工具开启了一个新的维度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so we have built our own MCPS uh MCP servers model context protocol uh in Python and they can speak to for example Snowflake uh DBT GitHub whatever API or if if you can do it in Python you can have it as an MCP pretty much uh and this kind of unleashes a new uh dimension of of using for example claw or cursor.</p>
</details>

现在，那位管理者可以做什么呢？他可以输入类似“我在哪里可以找到关于我们持仓数据的信息？”这样的问题，甚至不需要知道 Snowflake 是什么。然后你可以看到 LLM 开始工作，从所有这些 MCP 和工具中获取数据，收集、抽象，做 LLM 最擅长的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh this is going to be uh a bit small for you uh in the back um but I'll narrow it as we go. Uh and it's going to go a bit fast. We'll rewind as well. This is the user interface of a project in claude. Uh so uh this is the snowflake data catalog project we have with a predefined set of instructions uh and context. Uh and this is available to everyone and everyone knows how to use it thanks to the AI modules and training we we've had internally. Uh so what th could do here uh is writing something uh like where can I find information about our holding data without knowing like to be honest without knowing even what snowflake is. And then you can see uh the LMS working uh with this response um fetching data from all of these MCPS and tools uh and collecting it uh abstracting it doing what LM do best.</p>
</details>

它会提供一些发现或建议。它会发现这是一个使用 Snowflake MCP 的好案例，然后编写一些 SQL 查询，推送到 Snowflake，获取响应，并根据响应创建新的查询，如此迭代直到满意为止。然后，它还会利用这些信息发现这是 DBT 模型，于是从 DBT API 中获取一些质量指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and then it will uh as a as a main response here provide you with some findings or suggestions in a in a sense. Um if we jump like back to the top so so we can see what's actually going on here. uh is that straight after it gets the question it will uh find out that oh this is a good use case for the snowflake MCP uh and then it writes some some queries SQL uh pushes it down to snowflake gets responses based on that response it will create new queries push down to snowflake and then it will kind of iterate until until it's satisfied with its findings uh and then it will also uh use that information to find out that hey oh this is DBT models uh Let's let's find some some quality metrics from uh the DVT API uh which we've also integrated</p>
</details>

最后，它将所有这些来自 Snowflake 和 DBT 的信息连接成一个响应，这是一种**检索增强生成**（Retrieval Augmented Generation, RAG）技术。它会向你展示一系列模型、表格，包含关键质量指标、负责人、敏感度等。这样，即使不知道 Snowflake 是什么，你也不需要懂 SQL，就能很快找到我们有什么数据以及在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and then it uses all of these information from Snowflake and DBT and connects it into a response like a retrieval augmented generation uh where it will present you with a number of models uh tables with uh key quality metrics responsibles uh sensitivity etc. Uh and then this like from without even knowing what snowflake is uh you don't have to know SQL or anything you can pretty fast find out uh what we have and where we have it.</p>

### 全员加速：NBIM 的 AI 采纳与培训之道

我们所有人都需要利用人工智能，否则就会落后。人工智能现在是 NBIM 所有部门的焦点。工具已经为每个人准备好了，但如果没人使用，这些工具就毫无价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. So, it's all up to each and uh one of us to leverage on uh AI uh or else you will fall behind as we heard earlier today and uh AI is a focus in all of MBIM right now. Yes, I a focus in all of them. The tools are available for everyone and these tools are of no value uh if no one is using them.</p>
</details>

几个月前，Nicolai 给了我们一个任务：将效率提高20%。他不太确定他具体指什么，因为他做的事情和我做的、或者和交易员、投资组合经理、分析师、开发人员做的事情都不一样。所以我们需要用一种有点学术性的方法来处理这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A few months ago, U Nikolai gave us the task of becoming 20% more efficient. Uh he was not really sure what he meant as he said the stuff I do. Uh because the stuff he does is not the same as I do, nor is it lean or a trader, a portfolio manager, an analyst, a developer. So uh I'm not exactly sure what he does all the time. So um um not sure what any of us do all the time but I'll get back to that. So we need to try and approach this a bit academic.</p>
</details>

我们求助于沃顿商学院的 Ethan Molik 教授，他对于我们应如何将人工智能融入工作和日常生活有一些很好的想法。我们尝试采纳他的工作，并将其分解为四个关键领域：工具、项目、流程和习惯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with a good methology we turn to a professor at Wharton Eton Mollik and he has some good thoughts on how we all should adopt AI into our work and also into our daily life. So we tried to take uh Eton's work adapted to our own and broke it down into four key areas. Tools, project, processes and habits.</p>
</details>

首先，我们需要工具来让每个人都变得高效。我们选择了 Claude 作为我们的聊天客户端，Cursor 用于开发，Copilot for Office 用于所有与 Office 相关的工作。我们称之为我们的“3C”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first of all, as we have been discussed today, we need tools to get everyone uh productive. We selected Claude as our chat client. We selected curser for development, copilot for office for everything office related, transcribing, meeting etc. And we call these our three C's.</p>
</details>

其次是项目。对任何人来说，最好的学习方式就是亲手尝试。我们使用了 Claude 项目。它们是尝试新事物、改进它们并进行概念验证的好地方，而无需任何开发资源。截至目前，我们在 Claude 中有超过27,000个不同的项目。请记住，我们只有700名员工。所以对我们来说，这是个很大的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the easiest way for anyone to learn is to try the things out for yourself. And there we used claw projects. And I even showed you one of these and they're a great place to actually just try out new things, improve them and do your P uh PC proof of concept before you take it anywhere further. You don't need any developer resources or anything like that. As of now, we have more than 27,000 different project in CL and keep in mind we are only 700 employees. So to us that is a lot.</p>
</details>

第三是流程。我们如何工作？作为一个公共机构，我们不幸地相当官僚。我们如何使流程更高效？我们是否有因人工智能的引入而变得不合理的政策？例如，我们有成千上万页的合规文件，这些文件由人们精心创建，但之后却很少有人阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the next thing is processes. How do we do our work? As we are a public institution, we are unfortunately pretty bureaucratic. So how can we make our processes more efficient? Do you have policies in place which do not make sense with the introduction of AI? So we uh as an example have thousands and thousands of pages in complence which is thoughtfully created by people but hardly read later on</p>
</details>

最后是习惯。如果我们要提高效率，就需要改变我们的工作方式。如果我们不改变工作方式，我们就一无所获。但习惯真的很难改变。人们喜欢来上班，做和昨天一样的事情，因为那很舒服。改变习惯对每个人来说都是不舒服的。但那已经行不通了。你需要把人工智能带到你所做的每一件事中，无时无刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally, the habits. If we are to improve efficiency, we need to change the way we are working. We if we do not change the way we work, we haven't gained anything. But habits are really really hard to change. People like to come in and do the same things they did yesterday because that's comfortable. Changing habit is uncomfortable for everyone. So that doesn't cut it anymore. You need to bring AI to the table in everything you do all the time.</p>
</details>

那么，我们是如何开展这项工作的呢？首先，与人工智能团队、技术部门和我们的人力发展团队密切合作非常重要。在2025年，我们迎来了“技术年”，我们正在加速对人工智能的关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how did we work on this uh is well first of all it's really important with the close collaboration with the AI team and technology and uh our team people development uh where we work with pedagogical principles and behavioral models to to get adoption going and training and learning. uh and uh in 2025 we have tech year and we are focusing and accelerating our focus on AI</p>
</details>

毫无疑问，高层定下了非常强烈的基调。这是一种紧迫感，基金里的每个人在绩效管理流程中都会被评估人工智能的使用情况。正如 Nicolai 所说，如果你不使用或采纳人工智能，别人就会超越你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's no doubt right there's a really strong tone from the top. It's a sense of urgency and everyone in the fund is measured on AI in the performance management uh processes. And as Nikolai says um if you don't use or adopt AI, someone else uh will surpass you as he as he said earlier.</p>
</details>

那么，在“技术年”里，我们具体做了什么？我们启动了一个全面的人工智能大使计划，现在有40位大使。我们举办了“技术日”，这些是充满灵感的日子。我们还为开发人员提供了关于 MCP 和 RAG 的培训。我们刚刚完成了我们的“AI 技能提升”计划，夏天过后，我们还将进行 Vibe 编码的培训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But diving into techare, what do we actually do? So as you can see here, it's quite packed with activities. Uh but uh to highlight a few, we started off with a comprehensive AI ambassadors program. uh and uh we have now 40 uh ambassadors and we have done training uh in two rounds. So one completed and one is ongoing at the moment. Uh and then we have uh tech days uh that's inspirational days, the one in the orange with the star. Uh so we just had one super um exciting with different types of inspirational speeches but also really hands-on where you learn and really get your fingers dirty. Then we also have had AI developers training uh with uh as you've heard about MCPS and RAG um and we will uh we just finished our AI upskill program and after summer we will also have a um training for uh in vibe coding.</p>
</details>

“AI 技能提升”计划包含七个模块，是强制性的。每个人都必须参加。这是关于我们“3C”工具的培训：Claude、Cursor 和 Copilot。这本质上是关于改变习惯。我们的目标是提高效率，并理解如何开始，以降低改变习惯的障碍。这些课程是小型的，每隔一周30分钟，并且非常注重实践。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's dive into AI upskill. Uh and this contains of seven modules. Uh it's mandatory. So everyone needs to take these modules. And it's training on our three C's. So now you probably know them. It's cloth, cursor, and co-let. And this is essentially about changing habits. Um and that's a consistent theme throughout. Um and we are really trying to take it down removing all the bus and reaching that was what's in it for me mentality or dimension and the goal is to become more efficient um and understand how to get going to lower those barrier that the was talking about in terms of changing the habits and these uh sessions are bitsized uh meaning 30 minutes every other week and really hands-on</p>
</details>

那么效果如何？我们成功了吗？我们看到了什么？嗯，在培训或学习与发展方面，你并不总能看到行为或习惯的改变，但在这个项目中，我们实际上可以追踪到。我们看到每个模块之后都有非常清晰的联系。Cursor 或 Claude 的活动都创下了历史新高。我们现在有250名活跃的 Cursor 用户，他们用它来编码，这真的很了不起。到目前为止，我们估计已经节省了1.5亿个工作小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so what about the effect? What are we are we succeeding and what are we seeing so far? Um well working with training or learning and development it's not always that you see uh a change in behavior or a habit necessarily but in this initiative we can actually track it. So we see a really clear connection after each module. It's a all-time high activity in uh cursor or claude and we have now 250 active uh users in cursor who um uh is using it for coding which is really amazing and we have estimated so far that we have saved 150 million in work hours.</p>
</details>

展望未来，我们需要保持步伐。人工智能公司之间的竞争异常激烈，他们不断推出新东西，我们与人工智能一起发展。我相信我们几个月前就已经达到了20%的效率目标。Nicolai 和领导层的支持至关重要。但目标在演变。正如 Nicolai 多次说过的，这是一个“石油时刻”，一生一次的机会。人工智能将彻底改变我们的工作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um looking ahead well um we need to keep up the pace right uh it's an extreme race between the AI companies they uh they deliver new things all the time and uh we evolve alongside uh of AI and with any new technology as we all know uh it will be hiccups it will be setbacks uh but when something doesn't work 100% you don't abandon it. You try again uh and you find new ways. Yes. So we I believe we hit the 20% efficiency months ago and the Nikolai and the leadership backing for that has been crucial. But goals evolve as Nikolai has said a couple of time this is an oil moment once in a lifetime opportunity. AI will totally change how we work.</p>
</details>

历史告诉我们，真正的效率提升只有在我们停止做某件事或完全不做某项任务时才会出现。洗衣机并没有将洗衣效率提高20%，它解放了时间。洗碗机消除了手洗。计算器终结了手动计算。现在，机器人可以打扫你的房子，洗碗，为你做饭。所以你解放了更多的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So history shows us that real efficiency gains are only come when we stop doing something or doing the task entirely. So the washing machine didn't improve laundry by 20%, it freed up time, right? Dishwasher element eliminated hand washing. Calculators killed manual calculation. Uh now the robot X1 nail can uh clean up your house, do your dishes and cook for you. So you have freed up even more time.</p>
</details>

对我们来说，同样的原则也适用。我们需要从根本上重新思考工作本身。我们做的很多事情都是“伪工作”（sudo work），这些任务的存在仅仅是因为我们的工作结构，而不是因为它们本身创造了价值。我们填写表格来喂养其他表格。我们参加会议来计划会议。我们创建没人读的报告。效率不是做更多的工作，而是做正确的工作。让人类做人类擅长的事，把其他一切都交给人工智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for us the same principle applies. We need to radically think different about work itself. Much of what we do is sudo work, a task that exists only because of how our work is structured, not because they create value themsel. We fill out forms that feed other forms. We attend meetings to plan meetings. Uh we create reports that nobody reads. Uh, efficiency isn't about doing more work. It's about doing the right work. Let humans do what humans excel at. Trust AI with everything else. Thank you.</p>
