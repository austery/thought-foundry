### 市场概览：标普500指数创下历史新高

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘直播。今天股市动态纷呈，有许多头条新闻值得我们探讨。此外，盘后还有一些财报公布，其中半导体领域的消息尤为重要。我们一起来看看，并继续跟进。从目前的情况来看，今天将以一个上涨日收官。标普指数在过去30分钟的表现令人惊叹，不仅突破了6840点，更是达到了6849点，几乎触及6850点。真是不可思议的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. We got a bunch of different things going on in regards to the equity markets. A lot of different headlines. We got to talk about some of these headlines that just came in. Also, we've got some earnings after the bell. Some of them in the semiconductor space, which is going to be really important as well. So, we're going to take a look at that and keep going from there. I mean, so far, folks, based on what we're seeing, looks like we're going to end out on a green day. Looks like we're going to end out on a Wow, I didn't even see S&P for the past 30 minutes. Not only did I not see it hit 684. It's at 68490. It almost touched 685. Wow, what a day. I did not see that, but there you go.</p>
</details>

个股方面，谷歌表现出色，股价一度接近270美元，目前在269.74美元。特斯拉也曾触及460美元，随后有所回落，目前在440美元。Palantir 表现稳健，收盘价高于189美元就非常不错了，日内上涨2.8%。Robin Hood 同样表现强劲，股价达到149美元，接近150美元。Grab 实现了小幅突破，上涨4%，达到6.10美元。AMD 上涨2.2%。高通曾一度大涨20%，后回吐了一半涨幅，目前上涨10%。这源于他们发布了一款可能对AMD和英伟达构成威胁的新芯片。但市场似乎在公告后冷静下来，认为威胁可能没有那么大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did see Google get to 270. Right now, it's just or get close to 270. It's at 26974, just below that at 26902. So, Google having a great day. Tesla got to 460 at one point before a little bit of a sell-off right there. Tesla right now at 440. Palantir here. Hopefully we get that 190 close even if we don't above 189 is very nice. That's up 2.8% on the day. Robin Hood great day got to 149 almost back to 150 147. Grab a little bit of a breakout up 4%. You got 610 on Grab. AMD up 2.2%. Qualcomm which was up more at one point gave back 50% of the gains. It was up 20%. Now it's up 10% based on them unveiling a a new chip that potentially could be a threat to AMD and Nvidia. It's almost like the market woke up after the announcement and said, "Hey, maybe it's not that big of a threat."</p>
</details>

尽管高通有所回落，但整体市场表现依然良好。苹果上涨4%，Circle 上涨0.5%，Pinterest、NHS、微软、Palo Alto Networks 均录得上涨。以太坊触及4200美元后小幅转跌。Bit Mine 终于突破50美元关口，从上周的47美元涨至54.30美元，希望未来几天能收于55至56美元区间。SMCI 也从上周10%的跌幅中反弹。比特币则在115,000美元下方。总体而言，今天市场表现相当不错，各板块并未出现明显疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, so that one gave back some of the gains, but still pretty good day across the board. Apple's up 4%, Circle's up half a percent, Pinterest is up, NHS is up, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Ethereum 4,200, just went slightly red on the day, but still touched 42. You got Bit Mine right there 5430. Bit mine finally breaking above that 50 level. It was at 47 last week. So, nice to see it into the mid-50s and hopefully we can get a close uh into that 55 56 range over the coming days. SMCI up from the 10% decline that it had last week. Bitcoin right there just below 115. I mean, overall, it's been a pretty decent day across the entire board and you're not seeing that much weakness across some of these different sectors.</p>
</details>

当然也有少数股票下跌，例如 HIMS。今天下跌的股票名单很短，大部分股票都在上涨。Rocket Lab 上涨1.3%。Mike Alfred 新建仓的 ASST 大涨54%。如果你在130-140美元区间买入，现在应该有不错的收益。然而，今天受到冲击的一个板块是稀土股。TMQ 下跌15%，MP 下跌7%，US Critical Metals 下跌15%。这主要是因为市场预期中美紧张关系可能不会像之前想象的那么糟糕，从而降低了对美国国内供应商的需求。即使供应链，特别是半导体和电子产品领域的供应链仍然至关重要，但市场认为其规模可能不及预期。这种叙事的转变导致了这些股票的下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is HIMS? Hims, okay, HIMS is showing some weakness. That one's down. Again, there's a short list of stocks that actually are red today. A lot of the other stocks are green. Rocket Lab is green. That's up 1.3%. ASST. This was the new name that Mike Alfred took a position in. That's up 54% on the day. So, if you got in it, I mean, you're probably up if you didn't buy anywhere near the 180s right now at 169. It was kind of hovering around 130, 140 for the majority of the day. So, a bit of a breakout right there. And that one continues to go green. The one sector that is getting hit today is unfortunately these rare earth stocks. TMQ down 15, MP down seven, US down eight, critical metals down 15. Uh a lot of this due to the fact that if tensions with China are not going to be as bad as we thought, the domestic demand for suppliers in the United States is not going to be as large. And even if it is going to be super important for the broader industry of supply chains, particularly around semiconductors and electronics, it might not be as massive as what the market had expected. And so that narrative has shifted a bit and that's why you have a bit of decline on those names.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报前瞻

距离今天收盘还有11分钟，其他股票基本都处于上涨状态，连 Dutch Bros 也转绿，上涨了5.7%。我认为我们大多数人都会关注的几家关键财报包括：Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)，这是一家非常重要的公司；Celestica (CLS)；还有软件公司 Confluent (CFLT)，该公司今年已下跌21%。此外，Amcor (AMKR) 今天也有财报，过去几周我们讨论过它，股价从28.50美元涨到了33美元。最后，NXPI 也是一个值得关注的大公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everything else pretty much green on the day. So you're seeing some momentum. Yeah, even Dutch Bros. Even Dutch Bros picking up on the green. Now, let's get into the first story. We've got 11 minutes until the market closes today. Dutch Bros right there at 5.7%. The key earnings that I think most of us are going to be looking at are uh Cadence, Cadence Design Systems, that's a very important one. Celestica, they have earnings. Uh Confluent, if I'm not wrong, do they have earnings? Yes, Confluent, that's a software name, they have earnings. They're down 21% for the year. Uh Cadence, another big company, CDNS. And then Amcor, uh they also have earnings today. So that's one that a decent chunk of us are interested in. Talked about that over the past couple weeks. up from 2850 to 33. So, we're going to see what their earnings turn out to today. Cadence right there up 18% on the day. Yes. And then NXPI. NXPI as well. That one is uh also a big one that we should look at.</p>
</details>

We're going to stick around if you are interested and we'll have a little bit of a giveaway and some fun uh after the market close. Steve will be on around 4:30. So, we'll get some people on. We'll do some fun stuff and uh yeah, we'll celebrate the day. SoFi tomorrow, that's also important. We'll talk with Steve about some of his thoughts on SoFi going into tomorrow.</p>

### 焦点新闻：亚马逊计划裁员三万引发市场讨论

在收盘之际，最大的新闻是关于亚马逊的。据报道，亚马逊正在缩减规模，计划裁减30,000个公司职位。坦白说，如果这是由人工智能（AI）驱动的，那还挺吓人的。但这可能更多地是出于组织重组的需要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the big headline uh as we get into the close is Amazon, folks. Apparently, Amazon is uh well, they're downsizing. Report says they are highlighting 30,000 corporate jobs being cut. And this might not be due necessarily to AI because if it is that's kind of scary to be honest. Uh but it might be more due to just organizational restructuring. A little bit of coverage on this and then uh then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

这在很大程度上是亚马逊审视其劳动力，寻找提高效率空间的结果。在当前这个人人都在讨论AI是否能取代工作的时刻，发生了一件有趣的事情。各大公司都在审视自己的业务，思考哪些地方或许只需要两名员工而不是五名，并决定在这些领域进行裁员。他们也把AI当作借口，当某些业务部门表现不佳需要裁员时，他们会说：“我们正在研究如何利用AI来提高效率”，而实际上他们本来就需要裁员。我不是说亚马逊的情况完全如此，但我确实认为这符合当前经济中许多公司的趋势：要么放缓招聘，要么裁减员工，并可能暗示这是AI的原因，就像 Jassy 在他今年早些时候的信中所做的那样。但当你仔细审视时，你并不会看到工作岗位被一对一地自动化取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is largely Amazon taking a look at its workforce and seeing where it can be more efficient. You know, something interesting has happened with this moment where everybody's talking about whether AI can replace jobs. Companies by and large have looked and they've said, "Where are the places where we might need maybe two employees working instead of five?" And they've decided to cut there. They've also used AI as an excuse uh as a excuse for when they're suffering or not doing great in certain business units and need to um cut down. And they say they say, "Well, we're going to look at AI to make us more efficient." Uh where they just needed to do layoffs anyway. I'm not saying that's exactly what's happening with Amazon, but I do think that this is following a trend of many companies within the economy, either slowering hiring or cutting workforce and, you know, maybe winking at the fact that it's AI like Jasse might have done with his uh letter uh that he wrote earlier this year. Um where when you look at it, you don't see onetoone automation of jobs.</p>
</details>

作为亚马逊的股东，裁员意味着削减成本和开支，这对净利润率、营业利润率以及每股收益（EPS）的增长显然是好事。亚马逊今天上涨了1.3%。但我很好奇他们为什么要裁掉30,000个职位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for me, so what do we think folks? I mean, look, as an Amazon shareholder, obviously it, you know, if you cut jobs, you cut costs, you cut expenses, that's good for, uh, net income margins, good for operating income margins, obviously good for EPS growth. Amazon right there up 1.3% on the day. But I am curious why exactly they are trying to go for 30,000 jobs.</p>
</details>

### 多头主导市场，苹果逼近四万亿市值

看看苹果，这可能是标普指数上涨的另一个原因。苹果股价达到268美元，标普指数则突破了685点。天哪，685点！多头正在获胜，就这么简单。他们在10月10日经历了一次小挫折，一次价值200亿美元的加密货币清算事件，但多头随后逢低买入。美国银行表示，10月10日（周五）是历史上第五大单只股票资金流入日。他们确实在逢低买入，当天交易了6800万份看涨期权，其中大部分可能是在下跌势头中买入的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow, look at Apple. This is probably another reason why the S&P is moving. Apple right there 268, S&P 685. Oh my goodness. 685. Dude, the Bulls are winning. It's just that simple. The Bulls are winning. They had a little bit of a hiccup on October 10th. A little bit of a $20 billion crypto liquidation hiccup. But then what did the Bulls do? They bought the dip. Bank of America said Friday, October 10th was the fifth largest inflow for single stocks in history. I mean, they bought the dip. 68 million calls were traded that day. A lot of those likely on the buy side as um as we had any momentum to the downside.</p>
</details>

标普500指数达到685点，距离690点仅差5点，距离7000点不到2%。这绝对是不可思议的。苹果公司对此功不可没，股价可能正冲向270美元，目前为268.40美元，日内又上涨了2%。苹果是一家大公司，2%的涨幅意义重大。特斯拉股价为452美元，AMD上涨2.3%，SoFi则试图收于30美元。纳斯达克100指数（QQQ）创下历史新高，达到628点，上涨1.8%，继续攀升。谷歌股价非常接近270美元。谷歌和苹果都是标普500指数的重要组成部分，还有英伟达，它上涨了3%，达到191.42美元。在高通发布消息后，英伟达曾出现小幅波动，但市场并未过分在意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So 685 right there on the S&P 500. My goodness, that's five bucks away from 690. Less than 2% away from 7,000 on the S&P. Absolutely incredible. You got Apple right here helping to contribute. Apple potentially going for 270. 26840. That's up another 2% of the day. Apple's a big company, so 2% on Apple really does matter. Tesla right here 452. AMD that's up 2.3. And then SoFi trying to get that $30 close. The Q's 628 alltime high on the Q's up 1.8% continuing to make a move. You got Google. Are we touching 270 yet? On the Googs, we are very close to touching 270, but Google and Apple moving. Both of them big parts of the S&P 500 along with Nvidia. I mean, Nvidia's up 3%. 19142. Had a bit of a hiccup after that Qualcomm news came out, but markets didn't care too much. And that's why you got Nvidia right there at 191.</p>
</details>

苹果的市值达到4万亿美元了吗？非常接近了，股价可能只差40美分就能达到4万亿美元。目前市值为3.984万亿美元。如果在2025年我们能看到两家市值4万亿美元的公司，那对投资者来说将是一个非凡的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is Apple at 4 trillion? Is Apple at 4 trillion? Apple's really close, guys. It's probably what, 40 cents away. Not even a full dollar away in terms of share price to getting to 4 trillion. 3.984 trillion. Dude, if we see uh two4 trillion companies in 2025, I mean, what a remarkable period to live through as investors. What a remarkable period to live through as investors.</p>
</details>

保险类股也有所回升，Lemonade 当日大涨11%，Oscar 也上涨了2%。或许是市场对政府关门的担忧有所缓解，刺激了这些股票。UNH 早上还是下跌的，最终也转为上涨。**Fear & Greed Index**（恐惧与贪婪指数: 由CNNMoney开发，通过综合七个不同的市场指标来衡量投资者情绪的工具）现在在哪里？我们仍然处于“恐惧”区域。市场创下历史新高，而且是大幅度的，之前的历史高点是673.95点，我们现在是685点，但指数仍然显示恐惧。那么“贪婪”会是什么样子？是7100点还是7200点？如果是这样，那我们还有很长的路要走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tim Apple, baby. Tim Apple lemonade. Is that moving? Lemonade is green. Wow. 11% on the day. Look at that. Some of the insurance names picking up a little bit. Oscar right there. That's also up 2%. Maybe some capitulation on the shutdown, which is getting some of these names excited. UNH was red in the morning. UNH ended up going green. UNH ended up going green. Where is the fear and greed index? That's a good question. Fear and greed right here. Wow. We are still at fear. We are still at fear. All-time highs on the market by a pretty wide margin. It's not just the small all-time high. The previous alltime high was 673.95. We are at 685 and still have fear. I mean what does greed look like? Is greed gonna be 7100 7200 or something? Because if that's the case, we got a long way to go folks. We have got a long way to go to see how this plays out.</p>
</details>

数据中心相关的股票也在上涨。Nebius 上涨8%，达到125美元。CoreWeave 上涨2%，达到135美元。并非所有比特币矿商今天都上涨，Terawolf、Hive、Bit Farms 和 Cipher 下跌了，但 Clean Spark、IREN、Marathon、Riot 和 Galaxy 仍在上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even Nebus making a move. Nebius, Cory, a lot of these data center names. Look at that. Nebas right there. 125. That's up 8% on the day. Cororeeve that's up 2% 135. IN uh also doing well up 3%. Not all the Bitcoin miners went green today. You got Terowolf, Hive, Bit Farms, and Cipher that went down, but Clean Spark's up. I ran is up. Marathon's up. Riots's up. Galaxy ups. So, you got a lot of these names that are still going green as well, which is not is not too bad.</p>
</details>

过去几周的主线一直是财报进展，周三我们将迎来更多财报。银行股表现出色，消费品公司也表现强劲，餐饮业也不差。如果这种势头能持续下去，市场就有更多理由扩大其估值倍数。更不用说，我们很快就会迎来降息，就在周三。我认为市场也在为这次降息做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I think the story of the past couple weeks really has been earnings progression, and we're going to get a lot more earnings on Wednesday, and we're going to see how the story plays out. But the banks have crushed it, consumer companies have crushed it, uh restaurants have not been too bad. So, if that can continue, that is more of a reason for the market to expand its multiple. Not to mention the fact we've got a rate cut coming up pretty soon. That's going to be on Wednesday. And I think the markets are also getting ready for what that rate cut is going to look like.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与展望

今天的大新闻是亚马逊裁员30,000人，而且这些都是公司白领职位，而非工厂或仓库工人。这意味着亚马逊正在对其组织进行全面重组。另外，巨鲸投资者今天以及过去几周购买了数百万美元的特斯拉看涨期权，目标是2025年11月525至550美元的行权价，以及2026年6月560美元的行权价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the big story of the day was Amazon and that 30,000 uh job cut. We're going to get more details on that probably over the coming weeks. But you do, and these are corporate jobs. These aren't people in the factories in the warehouses. So these are more so like white collar jobs that Amazon is thinking of getting rid of, which again would be a total restructuring of their organization. Tesla, by the way, Wales bought millions worth of calls today and over the past couple weeks. We've been eyeing that 525 to 550 strike for November 2025. A lot more of the 560s were bought today for June 2026. So you've got a decent amount of people buying up those Tesla calls.</p>
</details>

尽管特斯拉的财报不是最好的，但最终，没有多少方式能像特斯拉那样让你接触到人工智能。华尔街似乎并不在乎。此外，即使在财报公布后，特斯拉获得的评级也普遍看涨。今天，Canaccord 将其目标价从385美元上调至510美元。越来越多的人表示，他们不在乎数字不好看，不在乎盈利负增长，只在乎这个故事会按照他们预想的方式发展，并愿意用今天的利润缺失来换取未来指数级的利润增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, Tesla earnings wasn't the best, but at the end of the day, there's not that many ways to get exposure to AI in the way that Tesla gives you exposure. And it seems like the street doesn't care. Also, the upgrades that Tesla's been getting even after those earnings have been relatively bullish across the board. They got upgraded by Caner today to 510 from 385. So, you're getting a lot more people just saying, "Look, we really don't care that the numbers are not that good. We don't care that there's negative earnings growth. just care that this story is going to play out the way we think it's going to play out and we're willing to subsidize the story with a lack of profits today for exponentially more profits in the future.</p>
</details>

这就是特斯拉上涨的原因。AMD 股价260美元，标普500指数685.42点，基本是日内高点。距离收盘还有三分钟，标普指数正在全力冲刺。AMD 股价260美元，这是一个历史新高。如果收盘价在260美元，那将是AMD的历史新高。苹果股价268.88美元，市值达到3.991万亿美元。如果不是今天，那很可能就是本周，只要财报良好，苹果市值将达到4万亿美元。微软也不甘落后，市值为3.954万亿美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's why Tesla's green AMD right there 260 S&P 68542 basically high of day. We got three minutes left until the market closes. S&P is really going for it right now. Absolutely incredible. AMD 260. We did hit uh two Oh, no. That's an alltime high. I thought, why did I think we were Oh, I was thinking of Google. Above 260. Wow. That's an all-time high for AMD. If it closes at 260, it's at 259.80 right here. That is an all-time high for AMD. My Some of these stocks, it's hard to keep up with their all-time highs. Apple right there 268.88. Is Apple at 4 trillion yet? Apple is at 3.984. Apple still below. No, no, Apple 3.991. If it's not today, it's probably going to be this week. as long as they can have a good earnings. Apple's going to four trill. Microsoft as well. Yeah. 3.954. Microsoft's not uh not that far behind.</p>
</details>

今天真是疯狂的一天，可能让很多在过去几天里挣扎的投资组合都回了本。苹果股价正试图冲击269美元。我们正在目睹全面的价格发现。甲骨文股价281美元，当天小幅下跌。英伟达仍上涨2.83%。我们关注的财报名单包括 Cadence 和 NXP。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Wow. What a day, guys. What a freaking day. My It's one of those days that probably recouped a lot of portfolios that were struggling over the past couple days. Apple right there trying to hit 269. It did hit 269 and you're continuing to see this move. Yeah, price discovery across the board is also something that we're seeing. Oracle right there 281. That's slightly down on the day. Nvidia still up 2.83. So the earnings watch list we have is Cadence. That's going to be a big one. And then NXP.</p>
</details>

今天盘后财报关注的公司有 Cadence (CDNS)、NXPI、Confluent (CLT) 和 Amcor。感谢大家来到这里，也感谢所有的生日祝福。收盘后我们会做一些有趣的生日活动，Steve 也会来到节目中。非常感谢每一位观众。今天真是不可思议的一天，很高兴在经历了过去几周的痛苦之后，看到市场出现这样的势头。看起来，今天可能就是痛苦过后收获的日子。

### 收盘总结与盘后动态

好的，10月27日星期一，股市现已收盘。Palantir 未能收于190美元，但盘中一度达到192.83美元，收盘价为189美元，我已经很满意了。Palantir 与波兰国防部签署了意向书，Lumen 合同价值2亿美元，过去几周有很多催化剂推动其股价上涨。Palantir 收于189.14美元，当日上涨2.44%。Robin Hood 收盘上涨4%，接近149美元，收于146美元。特斯拉表现出色，上涨4%至452美元。英伟达重回190美元区间，上涨2.8%。标普500指数收于685点上方。

<p class="english-text">Yes, Celestica as well. We'll look at Celestea and we'll put that on the list for the earnings that we got. All right, here we go. Thank everybody for being here. Monday, October 27th. I am now 28 years old and the stock market is now closed. All right, there you go. We are done for the day. Paler did not give us the 190 close, but we got to 192 at one point. 19283. Closed at 189. I'll take it. I will take it. Again, pounder signed that letter of intent with the defense ministry of Poland. Lumen contract was $200 million. So you had a lot of different catalysts going the right direction for pounder over the past couple weeks. 18914 on pounder. That's up 2.44% on the day. Robin Hood ends out the day at 4% almost was at 149 closed at 146. Tessy great day 4% 452. Nvidia back into the 190s 2.8%. S&P 500 closes above 685.</p>

如果你一直看空，面对所有看空的理由，却看到标普500指数不仅创下历史新高，而且是大幅超越前期高点，这确实很难理解。更何况美联储即将降息，财报季也即将到来。本周，占标普500指数43%的公司将公布财报，而最重要的“七巨头”将在两天后公布。如果它们的财报良好，谁知道市场会怎么走呢？也许7000点并不遥远。

<p class="english-text">Again, if I if you've been bearish, it's really hard to see that with all the bearish arguments one could make to see the S&P go not only at an all-time high, but a, you know, a real uh degree of magnitude of above alltime highs or at least above the previous all-time highs. It's quite incredible. And then you've got the Fed cutting rates and earnings coming up. The most important companies in the S&P 500, 43% of them are reporting earnings this week. But the most important ones, aka the MAX 7, are reporting in two days. If they deliver good earnings, I mean, who knows, dude. Who knows? Maybe that 7,000 is not that far away as you've got rate cuts coming down the corner and then you got earnings growth potentially leading to more momentum.</p>

NXPI is flat. And then Cadence is slightly flat. Uh Celestica is another one we have. Let me see if I can get these numbers. Oh, we have Whirlpool today. Okay, I'll put that on the list as well. Uh, that'll be important for the consumer.</p>
</details>

Cadence 的财报出来了。每股收益1.93美元，同比增长17%，超出预期。营收13.9亿美元，也超出预期。营收同比增长10%，每股收益同比增长18%。这是一家重要的芯片设计公司，市值950亿美元。尽管业绩超预期，但盘后股价小幅下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Cadence. I got Cadence. Here we go. Cadence beat EPS 193, up from 17% on a beat year-over-year. And then revenue 1.39 billion. Cadence looks like they beat on the top and the bottom. Uh, this one is slightly flat after hours to red. It's a very slight red. Nothing too crazy, but that is great. But that is a beat on the top and the bottom. Beat by 8% and then beat by 1%. 193 versus 179. 1.3 versus 1.32 billion. Revenue is up 10% year-over-year. EPS is up 18% year-over-year. These guys do chip design. It's an important company. Market cap is 200 or 95 billion. Um, so you know, $100 billion company, not a small company by any means, but that one is slightly up.</p>
</details>

Amcor 的财报显示，净销售额19.9亿美元，毛利润2.84亿美元，营业利润1.59亿美元，净利润1.27亿美元，每股收益51美分，基本符合预期。股价基本持平。Confluent 盘后上涨7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I have this. Okay. Net income or net sales 1.99 billion. Gross profit 284 million. Operating income 159. Net income 127. EPS of 51 cents. I think that came in line with expectations. EBID of 340 million. stock is basically flat 3215 not really seeing a big move up or down. Confluent that's up 7%. I'll get more on those results in a second, but Amcor being relatively flat.</p>
</details>

Amcor 实现了双重超预期。CEO表示，第三季度营收达到19亿美元，同比增长31%，主要受先进封装需求推动，该业务创下新的营收记录。公司在亚利桑那州的新先进封装和测试园区也已破土动工。尽管业绩亮眼，但股价波动不大，基本持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Amcore got a double beat. CEO says Amcor delivered third quarter revenue of 1.9 billion up 31% fueled by demand for advanced packaging which set a new revenue record. This quarter, we executed steep production ramps, achieved record revenue in our communications and computing and markets, and broke ground on our new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona, reinforcing our commitment to enable our customers technology roadmaps and strengthen US semiconductor manufacturing. Uh CEO will also be going through a succession plan. So, it looks like they're going to be putting someone else in the CEO position. But you got to beat on the top and the bottom. Stock is up and down, up and down. Not really making a big move. Basically flat. I mean, it was at 33 the whole day. Now it's at 33 after hours. But you do have a pretty big beat.</p>
</details>

F5 Networks 也公布了财报，每股收益4.39美元，超出预期的3.97美元，营收同比增长8%。这是一家云应用安全和在线欺诈预防公司，市值170亿美元，今年以来股价上涨了15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh F5, they also had earnings today, 439 versus 397. That's a beat by 11%. And then revenue is up 8% uh on the year. I'm actually not too familiar with this company. F5 FFIV. This stock year-to date 17 billion company's up 15%. Cloud application security online fraud pre prevention. Okay, maybe a sub branch of cyber security, but that stock up 15%. That stock up 15%. Network plus cyber. All right. Well, that one moving a little bit after hours with a bit of a beat on the top and the bottom.</p>
</details>

Galaxy Digital 宣布发行10亿美元的可转换优先票据，股价盘后下跌。对于一家今年已经上涨了150%的公司来说，利用高股价进行融资是明智之举，尽管对股东来说可能不是最友好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Galaxy just offered a billion dollars in exchangeable notes. Is that stock tanking or is the market okay with it? Galaxy, it's down. Not down like crazy, but it's down. Galaxy is down 3.3%. Legend doesn't show you, but on Weeble it shows down 3.3%. A billion in equity. Didn't these guys already do a capital raise? Galaxy Digital offer a billion of exchangeable senior notes due May 1st, 2031. Option for initial purchasers to buy an additional 150 million proceeds to fund business growth, general corporate purposes, and potential repayment of 2026 notes. Okay. So, I mean, look, if the demand is as strong as it is for data centers, then diluting by a billion shouldn't necessarily affect shareholders that much, but that stock is down a bit uh a bit after hours. I think this one gets eaten up. I mean, I don't know if the street gets that upset about this. We saw Iran do this a couple weeks ago. We saw Bit Farms do this literally last week. They did a $300 million convertible note. Now, that Bit Farms hasn't been able to recover since then, but Galaxy is a bit more advanced than Bit Farms. That one is slightly down.</p>
</details>

Rambus 的财报不及预期，每股收益为44美分，低于预期的51美分，导致股价下跌。而 Amcor 的每股收益为51美分，远超华尔街预期的43美分，但市场反应平淡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Rambus is down. Rambus is an American technology company that develops and licensed chip interface technologies and architectures that are used in digital electronic products. I didn't even know they had earnings, but let's take a look at them. Oh boy. Yeah, there you go. You're getting a bit of a beating right there. Let me pull up those numbers and see if they missed it. Rambus right here, they missed by 14% on EPS. 44 cents versus 51 cents expected. 178 versus 175 million revenue. They beat by 2%. Okay, so Rambus did not have a double meep. This one's getting hit. And yeah, an Amcor Street wanted 1.932. They came in at 1.9 EPS. I mean, dude, the street wanted 43 cents. They came in at 51. It's a decent beat. It's a decent beat. I mean, if you own the stock, you're probably not too upset at the earnings. It's just the street's not overly enthusiastic.</p>
</details>

Whirlpool 的财报非常亮眼。营收达到40.3亿美元，超出预期的39.2亿美元。调整后每股收益为2.90美元，远超预期的1.43美元。尽管公司面临关税的不利影响，但这仍然是一个非常不错的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whirlpool, this will tell us a little bit more about the consumer. I don't see their earnings yet. That one I am definitely interested in. Lots of dishes and washing machines is what you would see. Oh my, that's a hell of a beat. Wow. Whirlpool 3.92 billion. They came in at 4.03. So they beat on revenue. They achieved 50 million in quarterly cost reductions. Uh adjusted EPS was $29 versus a $143 expected. I mean, dude, that is not a bad quarter, especially because they are also prone to tariffs. The stock is already down 35% year-to date. So, any piece of good news would be good for them. Again, a lot of the tariffs probably are affecting their cost of goods across the world, especially in China. Those are some pretty deep numbers. Those are some pretty pretty good numbers.</p>
</details>

NXPI 的财报显示，每股收益为3.11美元，同比下降9%，略低于预期的3.12美元。营收为30.17亿美元，同比下降7.2%，但略高于预期。市场对此反应平淡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">NXPI is up. Okay, NXPI. Let's see. This is another semiconductor company. $55 billion market cap. That one is also flat. That one is also flat. Looks like earnings EPS is $311. That's down 9% year-over-year. Revenue, they missed as well. 3.017 billion, down 7.2%. Okay, so you got a miss on the top and the bottom it looks like for NXP. markets not giving them too much hate for that. Actually, no. They beat on revenue. It's a very slight beat on revenue, but they did beat on revenue. They did miss on EPS. EPS, they missed 311 versus 312. Again, also a slight miss. That's not a crazy miss. And then revenue 3.1 versus 3.16. EPS is down 10%. Year-over-year revenue is down 2%. Market's not caring too much.</p>
</details>

Celestica 盘后大涨，这家加拿大公司今年以来已经上涨了224%。其财报非常出色，每股收益1.58美元，超出预期的1.49美元，同比增长50%。营收31.9亿美元，超出预期的30.4亿美元，同比增长28%。

Most most companies in Canada that most most of us know are like the Shopifies of the world. There you go. Okay, let me see their beat on the top and the bottom. Uh, wow.

### 市场花絮与展望

有消息称，众议员 Dan Newhouse 在8月17日首次购买了AMD股票，他恰好在能源拨款小组委员会任职。而今天，美国能源部宣布与AMD达成10亿美元的合作协议，建造两台超级计算机。这再次引发了关于政客股票交易的讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of politicians, here's an update as well. Dan New House bought AMD on August 17th, his first ever buy of AMD. He serves on the House Appropriation Subcommittee on Energy. Today, the Department of Energy announced a $1 billion partnership with AMD to build two supercomputers. So again, we're not saying he knew that the Department of Energy would give AMD a billion dollar partnership even if he serves on the House Appropriations of Subcommittee on Energy. We're just saying he's a phenomenal stock picker. And you know that that is the implication from when you see this type of stuff. So shout out to Mr. Dan New House for knowing his [ __ ] when it comes to picking stocks.</p>

Robin Hood 平台新增了封闭式基金。此外，历史数据显示，10月28日是一年中最为看涨的一天，自1950年以来，标普500指数在这一天的平均涨幅为0.5%。今天，标普500指数上涨了1.12%。如果历史趋势得以延续，我们可能会向7000点迈进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, Robin Hood brought closedend funds to the platform. I'm going to be honest, I don't know that much about closed-end funds. Uh but you can now invest in 400 of them. I have to do more research on what exactly a CF is, but Robin's bringing them to the platform. If you are someone who invests in closed-end funds, then you've, you know, been waiting for this. Oh, take a look at this chart right here. This this I thought was pretty cool. October 28th is the most bullish day of the year. On average, the S&P 500 since 1950 has been up half a percent. The S&P 500 was up 1.12% today. If we go up another half a percent, we are going to be inching towards 7,000 if the historical trend of October 28th actually uh stays intact.</p>
</details>

最后，关于亚马逊的裁员，有分析认为，在财报前宣布裁员可能是一个“黄旗”信号，暗示季度业绩可能不佳。公司可能想通过裁员来转移视线。但也有可能业绩很好，公司希望通过宣布节省开支的消息让业绩看起来更好。长期来看，华尔街会为AI驱动的效率提升而欢呼，但短期内，这则消息的时机确实引人深思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, what do you think about the Amazon layoff? Someone said on CBC it's a yellow flag right before earnings. You know, let's get a little bit more coverage on that. I'm not fully sure what to make of it. It It was a bit weird for them to do 30,000 right before the quarter. It's almost them saying, "Hey, the quarter is going to suck, but look, we cut 30,000 jobs, so don't get mad at us if the uh if the earnings aren't the best, which, you know, that is a little bit of a yellow flag, but maybe the earnings are good and they want to make the earnings even better by saying we're going to save a bunch of money." So, we got to kind of see how it plays out. In the long run, I do think that Wall Street will cheer for efficiency driven by AI that we will undoubtedly see not just at the MAG7 companies, but across every company in America, but in the short term, I think there's a different question, which is hearing about layoffs this close to earnings for me is a little bit of a yellow flag because politically it's hard to talk about doing layoffs and then have a monster earnings quarter. you know, it's easier to kind of get past that quarter and then maybe do it in a few weeks. Now, maybe this news wasn't intended to get out right now. Obviously, it had been rumored for a few weeks, but that's something that I'm thinking about just in the immediate term is does this sort of point to maybe a rougher quarter for Amazon here in a couple of days.</p>
</details>

Waste Management 的财报不及预期，营收和每股收益双双未达标，导致股价下跌。这可能更多是公司内部运营效率问题，而非垃圾回收需求问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But waste management, folks. There you go. You got your revenue. Uh looks like it's a miss. Stocks down 5% right here. 6.4 came in at 6 point or 6.531. It came in at 6.4. EPS 198 versus 204. Uh it got a bit of a miss on waste management. This stock has it's not really been doing the best this year. It's up six%. It's not supposed to move like crazy. You know, it pays a consistent dividend, but uh every opportunity it's had to really break out. It's it's just not delivered the best earnings. This is very similar to the miss they had last quarter. So, you got a double miss on waste management. I I don't think there's a demand problem for picking up trash. I think this might be more operational efficiencies inside of the company that led to these bad margins and that's why you're getting some pain right there. So there you go. Waste management. That one is slightly down.</p>

Amit: 好了，既然你们都在这里，首先，谢谢你们的到来。非常感谢。Tanner，我们明天有个大日子。你认为 SoFi 会大涨吗？明天是 SoFi 重新评级的一天吗？
Tanner: 我想这将是激动人心的一天。我只是不知道有多少利好已经被提前消化了。财报前股价到30美元，这是我们历史上从未见过的。话虽如此，如果我们新增一百万会员，我认为股价会更高。我非常兴奋。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay. Anyway, well, while I got you guys here, first of all, thank you guys for being here. Deeply appreciate it. Tanner, we're going to be doing a podcast at 9:30 anyway, so uh we'll be talking. Um, dude, we got a big day tomorrow. I mean, you think you think we're going to really make a run for it? Is tomorrow the day SoFi gets rerated?
Tanner: Uh, it's going to be an exciting day, I think. I just don't know how much of this is sort of pulled forward a little bit. Um, $30 going into earnings. I mean, we've never seen this before, ever in history. Uh that said, if we get a million new members, um I think uh this the stock's going to head higher. I'm pretty excited. And you're excited. I mean, you actually bought into this company.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我必须得买，兄弟，因为如果这支股票大涨，其他人都玩得很开心，我可不想在场边无聊。所以我说，你知道吗？我宁愿被套牢也不愿错过乐趣。而且我从基本面上也认为，他们应该会有一个好季度，尤其是在降息即将到来的情况下。
Tanner: Amit 联系我说，“Tanner，我该买这个吗？”当时股价大概26美元。他说，“我该买这家公司吗？”我说，“嗯，如果你不在乎它，可能不该买，我们永远不知道财报会怎样。所以，买一些你真正信服的东西吧。”然后他说，“好的，我买一千股。”然后就这样了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I did. I kind of had to, bro, because if this thing runs and everyone else is having fun, I'm going to be bored on the sidelines. So said, you know what? I'd rather bag hold than miss out on the fun. I also do fundamentally think like they should be setting up for a good quarter especially with rate cuts coming. So
Tanner: admit uh you know reached out and he said uh Tanner should I buy this? It was like around 26 bucks or something. He goes should I buy this company? And I was like well if you don't care about it like probably not like we never know what's going to happen on earnings. So like you know buy something that you're actually convinced on. Then he said okay I'll buy a thousand shares and then that was it.</p>
</details>

Steve: 我听说在 SoFi 周刊上，你对 SoFi 的看法偏向悲观而非乐观。你认为明天真的会是一个好季度吗？
Steve: 是的，我的意思是，它能成为一个好季度吗？是的。它会很快涨到45美元吗？我仍然持怀疑态度，但如果他们明天能新增一百万会员，我想这会很快改变我的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: I I heard on the SoFi Weekly you were a little bit more bearish than bullish. So, do do you think tomorrow can really be a good quarter?
Steve: Yeah, I mean, look, can it be a good quarter? Yes. Um, is it going to 45 anytime soon? I am still skeptical, but if they blow out a million members tomorrow, I mean, I think that's going to change my opinion pretty quickly. And when they did the dilution, Tanner and I were pretty bullish about it, even though a bunch of people on X weren't. So, I do think they're going to have the ability to put up a good quarter. And I'm very interested in what the commentary is around rate cuts and what they're seeing in the housing market. So, we'll see what happens.</p>

Tanner: 我认为到周四，我们将看到超过四分之一的标普500公司财报更新，仅 Meta、谷歌、亚马逊、苹果和微软这五家公司就占了标普500总权重的24.6%。所以如果它们都表现出色，我们可能会看到爆炸性的反弹。我确实认为到年底我们会看到指数超过7000点。所以我保持看涨，我的所有筹码都已入场。

<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. So I'll ask you guys one question then I'll let you guys leave. again. Really appreciate you guys even hopping on to the show. Um, first of all, let's just let's just do a straight up market question. We'll go around the room. Alltime highs on the S&P still moving after hours basically 686 68595. Tanner, we'll start with you. Just reaction to the Oh, there you go. 686. Reaction to the market doing what it's been doing.
Tanner: I think uh you know by Thursday we're going to see more than a quarter of the S&P 500 earnings be updated just in those five names Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That's 24.6% of the total waitings of the S&P 500. So if they all shine, if if everything goes through as expected, then we could see an explosive rally. And I do actually think that we're going to see north of 7,000 by the end of the year. So I remain bullish and um yeah, all my chips are on the table. I mean, I can't find any cash anymore.</p>

Steve: 我在年初就预测7000点，整个过程一直都是7000点。我不会下调，也不会上调。我就坚持7000点。
Roy: 一切都非常看涨。当然，有一些远期因素不一定如此，但市场有真正的潜在动力。如果财报良好，没有什么能阻止牛市继续攀升。
Matt: 我不相信现金。我通常是满仓的。我觉得我们有点累了，但还不足以见顶。我认为我们还有5%到10%的上涨空间才会真正转向。这意味着市场可能还有500点的上涨空间，所以我认为在真正出现大幅回调之前，我们可能会达到7250点。

<p class="english-text">Steve: Okay, there you go. It's going I mean, look, how can I change my opinion, right? I was at 7,000 the beginning of the year. I've been 7,000 the whole time. I'm not revising it down. I'm not revising up. I'm just sticking at 7,000.
Roy: I mean, pretty much everything is very bullish. There are, you know, some things further on the horizon that are not necessarily, but there are some that are sitting heavy in cash or all cash. Um, I'm like Tanner. I I have very little cash left. Uh, probably 1% cash at this point and it's probably going to be deployed this week. Um, you know, we we're the a roller coaster is still in full operation. So, there will be times where on again, off again hits with tariff stuff, but there's real underlying momentum in the market. Uh, of course the the tariffs of being resolved. Uh, if you know it's it's not permanent yet, but if that's actually the case, there's not much in the term of worry uh to prevent the bull market from continuing to climb as long as earnings are good. Tander said it best there. Um, and so this week I think really tells us that rate cuts also very good for the markets too. So it's a good time to be invested and uh glad that all I think all of us are pretty much fully invested. So,
Matt: Yeah, I don't I don't believe in cash. Um, so somebody said cash uh in the chat. I agree with that. I I generally don't don't believe that I'm normally fully invested and every paycheck that I get, I I generally put all that as much as I can feasibly into the into the markets. But I mean, I do feel like we're getting a little tired here, but I don't think that it's tired enough where we're going to see it top out. I I do think that we still have another 5 to 10% to go before we really turn over. So, I feel that that means that we have another uh potentially uh 500 points potentially to go in the market. So, I can see us getting to 7250 um before we really start to see some sort of large retracement. Um you know, we started to see some efficiency gains. You just saw Amazon potentially announce 30,000 potential layoffs. Um, actually just like 10 15 minutes ago, an article, I think it was from Reuters, uh, released about potential 30,000 people laid off. So, I think people are really trying to find where that next dollar is coming from to hit the bottom line. And, um, you know, that coupled with efficiencies gained from AI, uh, I don't think that we're done here. And these companies, believe it or not, even though everyone's thinking the S&P 500's expensive, I mean, Steve went over it in a really good fashion yesterday on his uh big tech earnings kind of preview, these companies are growing at a pretty expansive rate. And um when you look at it on a forward, you know, 2026 2027 basis, if they hit the numbers, they're actually not that expensive. Um and and these are premium businesses that are going to continue to deliver. So, uh, but that being said, they're running out of capex. So, um, to an extent. So, unless they grow massively, uh, I do think that you'll start to see some growth slowdown. But before we do that, I think we have another, uh, 5 10% to go easily, um, before we, we see some, uh, retracement.</p>

Amit: 我同意，但我们刚刚经历了3%的回调。所以，也许那就是疲惫的顶峰，市场需要清除一些泡沫。
Roy: 我们还在恐惧区，37点。
Amit: 是啊，这是关于这个市场最有趣的事情。今天感觉像恐惧吗？不。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. And I think, you know, when you said we are getting a little tired here, I I would agree, but it's also like we just had that 3% draw down. So, you know, may maybe that was like peak tiredness and markets needed to get some of the froth wiped out of everything. You know, SoFi got to stupid prices. A lot of these companies just got to dumb prices and uh now we're getting a bit of recovery and it doesn't mean we have to go back to alltime highs, but you're starting to see some of the more quality names get back to the juice they were having before. And if they can follow up with good earnings, you know, maybe that's what really can keep this this rally going on.
Roy: Yeah, we're still at fear.
Amit: 37.
Roy: Yeah, that that's the funniest saying about this market right now is does today feel like fear? No. There there's a lot that goes into this, but yeah.</p>
