### 市场概览：普涨行情与盘后财报预告

大家好，欢迎回到本期的市场收盘分析直播。今天股市动态纷呈，有许多头条新闻值得我们探讨。此外，盘后将有多家公司发布财报，其中一些半导体公司的业绩尤其值得关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. We got a bunch of different things going on in regards to the equity markets. A lot of different headlines. We got to talk about some of these headlines that just came in. Also, we've got some earnings after the bell. Some of them in the semiconductor space, which is going to be really important as well. So, we're going to take a look at that and keep going from there.</p>
</details>

从目前的情况来看，今天将以一个上涨日收官。我刚才有30分钟没看盘，没想到**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500 Index: 标准普尔500指数，衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票的市值加权指数）不仅突破了684点，甚至达到了684.90点，几乎触及685点。真是令人惊叹的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, so far, folks, based on what we're seeing, looks like we're going to end out on a green day. I didn't even see S&P for the past 30 minutes. Not only did I not see it hit 684. It's at 684.90. It almost touched 685. Wow, what a day. I did not see that, but there you go.</p>
</details>

### 个股表现亮点

个股方面，谷歌表现出色，股价一度接近270美元，目前在269.02美元。特斯拉也曾触及460美元，随后有所回落，目前股价为440美元。Palantir表现稳健，收盘价高于189美元就非常不错了，日内涨幅达到2.8%。Robinhood同样表现强劲，股价一度达到149美元，接近150美元。Grab实现了小幅突破，上涨4%，股价达到6.10美元。AMD上涨2.2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did see Google get to 270. Right now, it's just or get close to 270. It's at 269.74, just below that at 269.02. So, Google having a great day. Tesla got to 460 at one point before a little bit of a sell-off right there. Tesla right now at 440. Palantir, hopefully we get that 190 close, even if we don't, above 189 is very nice. That's up 2.8% on the day. Robin Hood, great day, got to 149, almost back to 150, 147. Grab a little bit of a breakout up 4%. You got 610 on Grab. AMD up 2.2%.</p>
</details>

高通今天发布了一款可能对AMD和英伟达构成威胁的新芯片，股价一度大涨20%，但随后回吐了一半涨幅，目前上涨10%。市场似乎在消息公布后冷静下来，认为其威胁可能没有那么大。尽管如此，今天整体市场表现依然相当不错。苹果上涨4%，Circle上涨0.5%，Pinterest、NHS、微软、Palo Alto Networks均录得上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Qualcomm, which was up more at one point, gave back 50% of the gains. It was up 20%. Now it's up 10% based on them unveiling a new chip that potentially could be a threat to AMD and Nvidia. It's almost like the market woke up after the announcement and said, "Hey, maybe it's not that big of a threat." So that one gave back some of the gains, but still a pretty good day across the board. Apple's up 4%, Circle's up half a percent, Pinterest is up, NHS is up, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks.</p>
</details>

加密货币方面，以太坊在触及4200美元后日内小幅转跌。Bit Mine终于突破50美元关口，从上周的47美元涨至54.30美元，希望未来几天能收于55至56美元区间。SMCI也从上周10%的跌幅中反弹。比特币价格略低于115,000美元。总体而言，今天整个市场表现相当不错，各板块并未出现明显疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum 4,200, just went slightly red on the day, but still touched 42. You got Bit Mine right there 5430. Bit mine finally breaking above that 50 level. It was at 47 last week. So, nice to see it into the mid-50s and hopefully we can get a close into that 55-56 range over the coming days. SMCI up from the 10% decline that it had last week. Bitcoin right there just below 115. I mean, overall, it's been a pretty decent day across the entire board and you're not seeing that much weakness across some of these different sectors.</p>
</details>

今天下跌的股票为数不多，HIMS是其中之一。大部分股票都收涨，例如Rocket Lab上涨1.3%。Mike Alfred新持仓的ASST更是大涨54%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is HIMS? Hims, okay, HIMS is showing some weakness. That one's down. Again, there's a short list of stocks that actually are red today. A lot of the other stocks are green. Rocket Lab is green. That's up 1.3%. ASST. This was the new name that Mike Alfred took a position in. That's up 54% on the day. So, if you got in it, I mean, you're probably up if you didn't buy anywhere near the 180s right now at 169. It was kind of hovering around 130, 140 for the majority of the day. So, a bit of a breakout right there.</p>
</details>

### 行业动态：稀土板块承压

今天唯一受到冲击的板块是稀土股。TMQ下跌15%，MP下跌7%，US Critical Metals下跌15%。这主要是因为市场预期中美紧张关系可能不会像之前想象的那么糟糕，从而降低了对美国国内供应商的需求。尽管稀土对于半导体和电子产品等行业的供应链至关重要，但其需求规模可能没有市场预期的那么大。这种叙事的转变导致了相关股票的下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one sector that is getting hit today is unfortunately these rare earth stocks. TMQ down 15, MP down seven, US down eight, critical metals down 15. A lot of this due to the fact that if tensions with China are not going to be as bad as we thought, the domestic demand for suppliers in the United States is not going to be as large. And even if it is going to be super important for the broader industry of supply chains, particularly around semiconductors and electronics, it might not be as massive as what the market had expected. And so that narrative has shifted a bit and that's why you have a bit of a decline on those names.</p>
</details>

### 财报前瞻：半导体与软件公司即将发布业绩

除稀土股外，其他板块几乎全线上涨，市场势头良好，连Dutch Bros也加入了上涨行列。距离今天收盘还有11分钟，我们关注的几家关键财报包括：Cadence Design Systems（CDNS），这是一家非常重要的公司；Celestica；软件公司Confluent，其股价今年已下跌21%；还有Amcor，这家公司我们过去几周也讨论过，股价从28.50美元涨到了33美元。此外，NXP（NXPI）也是一家值得关注的大公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everything else pretty much green on the day. So you're seeing some momentum. Yeah, even Dutch Bros. Even Dutch Bros picking up on the green. Now, let's get into the first story. We've got 11 minutes until the market closes today. The key earnings that I think most of us are going to be looking at are Cadence, Cadence Design Systems, that's a very important one. Celestica, they have earnings. Confluent, if I'm not wrong, do they have earnings? Yes, Confluent, that's a software name, they have earnings. They're down 21% for the year. Cadence, another big company, CDNS. And then Amcor, they also have earnings today. So that's one that a decent chunk of us are interested in. Talked about that over the past couple weeks. up from 28.50 to 33. So, we're going to see what their earnings turn out to today. And then NXPI. NXPI as well. That one is also a big one that we should look at.</p>
</details>

### 焦点新闻：亚马逊计划裁员三万，AI是推手还是借口？

今天收盘前的一大头条新闻是关于亚马逊的。据报道，亚马逊正在缩减规模，计划裁减3万个企业职位。这未必是直接由人工智能（AI）导致的，如果是的话，那确实有点吓人。这更可能与组织重组有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the big headline as we get into the close is Amazon, folks. Apparently, Amazon is downsizing. Report says they are highlighting 30,000 corporate jobs being cut. And this might not be due necessarily to AI because if it is that's kind of scary to be honest. But it might be more due to just organizational restructuring.</p>
</details>

这在很大程度上是亚马逊在审视其劳动力，寻找提高效率的方法。在当前人人都在讨论AI是否会取代工作的背景下，发生了一件有趣的事情。各大公司都在审视自己的业务，思考哪些地方或许只需要两名员工而不是五名，并决定在这些领域进行裁员。他们还把AI当作借口，当某些业务部门表现不佳需要裁员时，他们会说：“我们正考虑利用AI来提高效率”，而实际上他们本来就需要裁员。我不是说亚马逊的情况完全如此，但我确实认为这符合当前经济中许多公司的趋势：要么放缓招聘，要么裁减员工，并可能暗示这是AI的原因，就像（亚马逊CEO）Jassy在今年早些时候的信中所做的那样。但当你仔细研究时，并不会看到工作被一对一地自动化取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is largely Amazon taking a look at its workforce and seeing where it can be more efficient. You know, something interesting has happened with this moment where everybody's talking about whether AI can replace jobs. Companies by and large have looked and they've said, "Where are the places where we might need maybe two employees working instead of five?" And they've decided to cut there. They've also used AI as an excuse for when they're suffering or not doing great in certain business units and need to cut down. And they say, "Well, we're going to look at AI to make us more efficient," where they just needed to do layoffs anyway. I'm not saying that's exactly what's happening with Amazon, but I do think that this is following a trend of many companies within the economy, either slowing hiring or cutting workforce and, you know, maybe winking at the fact that it's AI like Jassy might have done with his letter that he wrote earlier this year. Um where when you look at it, you don't see one-to-one automation of jobs.</p>
</details>

作为亚马逊的股东，裁员意味着削减成本和开支，这显然有利于净利润率、营业利润率以及**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，衡量公司盈利能力的重要指标）的增长。但我很好奇他们为什么要裁减3万个职位。这些是企业职位，不是工厂或仓库的工人，而是白领工作岗位。这表明亚马逊正在对其组织进行一次彻底的重组。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As an Amazon shareholder, obviously, if you cut jobs, you cut costs, you cut expenses, that's good for net income margins, good for operating income margins, obviously good for EPS growth. But I am curious why exactly they are trying to go for 30,000 jobs. And these are corporate jobs. These aren't people in the factories in the warehouses. So these are more so like white collar jobs that Amazon is thinking of getting rid of, which again would be a total restructuring of their organization.</p>
</details>

### 市场脉搏：牛市势不可挡，苹果冲击四万亿市值

看看苹果的走势，这可能是标普指数上涨的另一个原因。苹果股价268美元，标普指数685点。多头正在获胜，就这么简单。他们在10月10日经历了一次小挫折，一次价值200亿美元的加密货币清算事件，但多头随后逢低买入。美国银行表示，10月10日（周五）是历史上第五大单只股票资金流入日。当天交易了6800万份看涨期权，其中大部分可能是买盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow, look at Apple. This is probably another reason why the S&P is moving. Apple right there 268, S&P 685. Oh my goodness. 685. The Bulls are winning. It's just that simple. They had a little bit of a hiccup on October 10th. A little bit of a $20 billion crypto liquidation hiccup. But then what did the Bulls do? They bought the dip. Bank of America said Friday, October 10th was the fifth largest inflow for single stocks in history. I mean, they bought the dip. 68 million calls were traded that day. A lot of those likely on the buy side as we had any momentum to the downside.</p>
</details>

标普500指数达到685点，距离690点仅差5美元，距离7000点不到2%。这绝对是惊人的。苹果公司对此贡献巨大，股价可能冲向270美元。苹果是一家大公司，2%的涨幅意义重大。特斯拉股价452美元，AMD上涨2.3%。**The Q's**（QQQ: 一种追踪纳斯达克100指数的交易所交易基金ETF）也创下历史新高，达到628点，上涨1.8%。谷歌股价非常接近270美元。谷歌和苹果都是标普500指数的重要组成部分，还有英伟达，其股价上涨了3%，达到191.42美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So 685 right there on the S&P 500. My goodness, that's five bucks away from 690. Less than 2% away from 7,000 on the S&P. Absolutely incredible. You got Apple right here helping to contribute. Apple potentially going for 270. Apple's a big company, so 2% on Apple really does matter. Tesla right here 452. AMD that's up 2.3. The Q's 628 all-time high on the Q's up 1.8% continuing to make a move. You got Google. Are we touching 270 yet? On the Googs, we are very close to touching 270, but Google and Apple moving. Both of them big parts of the S&P 500 along with Nvidia. I mean, Nvidia's up 3%.</p>
</details>

苹果的市值达到4万亿美元了吗？非常接近了，大概3.984万亿美元。如果我们在2025年看到两家市值4万亿美元的公司，那对投资者来说将是一个非凡的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is Apple at 4 trillion? Apple's really close, guys. It's probably what, 40 cents away. Not even a full dollar away in terms of share price to getting to 4 trillion. 3.984 trillion. Dude, if we see two 4 trillion companies in 2025, I mean, what a remarkable period to live through as investors.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，尽管市场创下历史新高，而且是大幅超越前期高点（前期高点为673.95，现在是685），但恐惧与贪婪指数仍然显示为“恐惧”。如果这还算恐惧，那贪婪会是什么样子？是7100点还是7200点？如果是这样，那我们还有很长的路要走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is the fear and greed index? Wow. We are still at fear. All-time highs on the market by a pretty wide margin. It's not just a small all-time high. The previous all-time high was 673.95. We are at 685 and still have fear. I mean what does greed look like? Is greed gonna be 7100, 7200 or something? Because if that's the case, we got a long way to go folks.</p>
</details>

过去几周的主线一直是财报进展。本周三将有更多财报公布。到目前为止，银行业、消费品公司和餐饮业的业绩都相当不错。如果这一趋势能够持续，市场就有更多理由扩大其估值倍数。更不用说，周三即将迎来降息，市场也正在为此做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I think the story of the past couple weeks really has been earnings progression, and we're going to get a lot more earnings on Wednesday, and we're going to see how the story plays out. But the banks have crushed it, consumer companies have crushed it, uh restaurants have not been too bad. So, if that can continue, that is more of a reason for the market to expand its multiple. Not to mention the fact we've got a rate cut coming up pretty soon. That's going to be on Wednesday. And I think the markets are also getting ready for what that rate cut is going to look like.</p>
</details>

### 收盘总结

市场现已收盘。Palantir收于189.14美元，日内上涨2.44%。Robinhood收涨4%，报146美元。特斯拉表现出色，上涨4%至452美元。英伟达重回190美元区间，上涨2.8%。标普500指数收于685点上方，创下真正意义上的历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The stock market is now closed. Palantir did not give us the 190 close, but we got to 192 at one point. Closed at 189.14 on Palantir. That's up 2.44% on the day. Robin Hood ends out the day at 4% almost was at 149 closed at 146. Tesla great day 4% 452. Nvidia back into the 190s 2.8%. S&P 500 closes above 685. Again, if you've been bearish, it's really hard to see the S&P go not only at an all-time high, but a real degree of magnitude above the previous all-time highs.</p>
</details>

考虑到即将到来的美联储降息和财报季，前景依然乐观。本周，占标普500指数43%的公司将公布财报，其中最重要的“七巨头”（Magnificent Seven）将在两天后发布业绩。如果它们的财报表现良好，再加上降息预期，7000点的目标或许并不遥远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you've got the Fed cutting rates and earnings coming up. The most important companies in the S&P 500, 43% of them are reporting earnings this week. But the most important ones, aka the MAX 7, are reporting in two days. If they deliver good earnings, I mean, who knows, dude. Who knows? Maybe that 7,000 is not that far away as you've got rate cuts coming down the corner and then you got earnings growth potentially leading to more momentum.</p>
</details>

AMD收于历史高点附近，上涨2.68%至259美元。SoFi成功收于30美元。谷歌收于268.95美元。Grab收于6.11美元，从上周的5.40美元大幅反弹。亚马逊上涨1.3%，Meta上涨1.6%。苹果收于268.78美元，基本是收盘价的历史新高。**VIX**（CBOE Volatility Index: 芝加哥期权交易所波动率指数，常被称为“恐慌指数”）当日下跌4%，对股市利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD closes at an all-time high or just below an all-time high at 2.68% 259. SoFi got the $30 close not too bad finally $30 close for SoFi. Google 268.95 just below 269. Grab got that 611. Grab was at 540 last week. So again like a lot of names it was on sale and for those that took advantage of it not too bad. Amazon's up 1.3%. Meta was up 1.6. Apple 268.78 basically an all-time high on the close. The VIX was down 4% on the day. Very good for equities.</p>

### 盘后财报深度解析

现在我们来看看盘后的财报情况。

**Cadence (CDNS):** 业绩超预期。EPS为1.93美元，同比增长17%；营收13.9亿美元。营收同比增长10%，EPS同比增长18%。这是一家重要的芯片设计公司，市值950亿美元。尽管业绩超预期，但盘后股价基本持平，略有下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Cadence. I got Cadence. Here we go. Cadence beat EPS 193, up from 17% on a beat year-over-year. And then revenue 1.39 billion. Cadence looks like they beat on the top and the bottom. This one is slightly flat after hours to red. Revenue is up 10% year-over-year. EPS is up 18% year-over-year. These guys do chip design. It's an important company. Market cap is 95 billion. Um, so you know, $100 billion company, not a small company by any means, but that one is slightly up.</p>
</details>

**Amcor (AMKR):** 实现双重超预期（double beat）。CEO表示，第三季度营收达19亿美元，同比增长31%，主要受先进封装需求推动，该业务创下新的营收记录。公司在亚利桑那州的新先进封装和测试园区已破土动工。尽管业绩强劲，但盘后股价波动不大，基本持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Amcore got a double beat. CEO says Amcor delivered third quarter revenue of 1.9 billion up 31% fueled by demand for advanced packaging which set a new revenue record. This quarter, we executed steep production ramps, achieved record revenue in our communications and computing and markets, and broke ground on our new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona, reinforcing our commitment to enable our customers technology roadmaps and strengthen US semiconductor manufacturing. You got to beat on the top and the bottom. Stock is up and down, up and down. Not really making a big move. Basically flat.</p>
</details>

**Confluent (CFLT):** 盘后上涨9%。这是一家软件公司，今年早些时候曾有被收购的传闻。财报显示，Confluent Cloud营收同比增长24%，剩余履约义务同比增长43%，增速加快。云营收为1.61亿美元，同比增长24%。市场对这些数据反应积极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Confluent that's up 9% that one moving. This is another software name that potentially was going to be acquired earlier this year, but it looks like that's holding on. Confluent delivered a strong quarter with 24% year-over-year growth in Confluent cloud revenue and 43% year-over-year growth and acceleration for remaining performance obligations. We're also seeing accelerating adoption of DSP components of our platform said the CEO. Cloud revenue was 161 million up 24% year-over-year. Our strong third quarter performance highlights the momentum of our data streaming platform and our diversified growth strategy. Looks like the street is liking these numbers as well.</p>
</details>

**Whirlpool (WHR):** 业绩和营收均好于预期，并上调了全年指引。公司表示正在应对关税带来的短期不利影响，特别是来自亚洲竞争对手的库存积压。盘后股价上涨约1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whirlpool earnings are out and it's a big beat on earnings. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Company also raising guidance for the full year, saying it is navigating the near-term unfavorable effects of tariffs. In particular, saying it's being impacted by inventory loading from Asian competitors. You can see those shares are up about 1% right now.</p>
</details>

**Celestica (CLS):** 盘后股价大涨，一度上涨10%。这家加拿大公司今年迄今已上涨224%。财报显示，EPS为1.58美元，超出预期的1.49美元，同比增长50%；营收为31.9亿美元，超出预期的30.4亿美元，同比增长28%。业绩非常强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Celestica is down 10%. Okay, so this is your big mover after hours. Year to date, Celestica is up 224%. They're a Canadian multinational design manufacturing hardware platform. Wow. Pretty big beat. 158 versus 149. 6% EPS beat. EPS is up 50% year-over-year. Revenue 3.19 versus 3.04. Revenues beat by 5%. Revenues up almost 30%, 28% year-over-year. Look at that. Up 9%.</p>
</details>

**NXP Semiconductors (NXPI):** 营收略微超出预期，但EPS未达标。EPS为3.11美元，同比下降9%；营收为30.17亿美元，同比下降7.2%。市场对此反应平淡，股价基本持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, NXPI. This is another semiconductor company. EPS is $311. That's down 9% year-over-year. Revenue, they missed as well. 3.017 billion, down 7.2%. Okay, so you got a miss on the top and the bottom it looks like for NXP. markets not giving them too much hate for that. Actually, no. They beat on revenue. It's a very slight beat on revenue, but they did beat on revenue. They did miss on EPS. EPS, they missed 311 versus 312. Again, also a slight miss.</p>
</details>

**Rambus (RMBS):** EPS未达预期，为44美分，低于预期的51美分，降幅14%。营收为1.78亿美元，超出预期的1.75亿美元，增幅2%。由于EPS未达标，该股受到冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rambus right here, they missed by 14% on EPS. 44 cents versus 51 cents expected. 178 versus 175 million revenue. They beat by 2%. Okay, so Rambus did not have a double beat. This one's getting hit.</p>
</details>

**Galaxy Digital (GLXY):** 宣布发行10亿美元的可转换优先票据后，股价下跌。对于这类已经大幅上涨的股票，公司进行融资是很明智的。虽然对股东不一定最友好，但考虑到该股今年已上涨150%，公司需要利用这一涨势来筹集资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Galaxy just offered a billion dollars in exchangeable notes. Is that stock tanking or is the market okay with it? Galaxy, it's down 8% on the offering. That's the other thing about these stocks that have run a lot. I mean, you cannot blame them for doing an offering because to them, they're like, "Hey, we're up 150%. If someone's upset about 150% thinking that's not shareholder friendly or that we don't care about shareholder returns, then essentially they're going to say screw you." Right? Like the stock's up 150% for the year. You just can't be that upset. So to them, they're like, "All right, we need to take advantage of this 150% move and we need to raise some capital." It it's very smart for these companies to do.</p>

### 华盛顿动态：议员精准投资AMD引发关注

最后一条值得关注的新闻：众议员Dan New House在8月17日首次购买了AMD股票。他任职于众议院能源拨款小组委员会。今天，美国能源部宣布与AMD达成一项价值10亿美元的合作协议，共同建造两台超级计算机。我们并不是说他提前知晓此事，只是说他是一位非常出色的选股人。

<p class="english-text">Speaking of politicians, here's an update as well. Dan New House bought AMD on August 17th, his first ever buy of AMD. He serves on the House Appropriation Subcommittee on Energy. Today, the Department of Energy announced a $1 billion partnership with AMD to build two supercomputers. So again, we're not saying he knew that the Department of Energy would give AMD a billion dollar partnership even if he serves on the House Appropriations of Subcommittee on Energy. We're just saying he's a phenomenal stock picker. And you know that that is the implication from when you see this type of stuff.</p>

### 市场展望：多位分析师预测后市走向

*   **Tanner:** 到本周四，我们将看到超过四分之一的标普500指数权重公司（Meta、谷歌、亚马逊、苹果和微软）更新财报。如果它们都表现出色，我们可能会看到一轮爆发性的上涨。我确实认为到年底我们将看到指数突破7000点。我仍然看涨，我的所有筹码都已在桌上。
*   **Steve:** 我还能怎么改变我的看法呢？我年初就预测7000点，整个过程都坚持这个观点。我不会下调，也不会上调，就坚持7000点。
*   **Roy:** 目前几乎所有因素都非常利好。当然，远期也存在一些不确定性。但我像Tanner一样，现金仓位很低，可能只剩1%，而且这周可能就会全部投出去。市场的过山车仍在全速运行。只要财报良好，就没有太多因素能阻止牛市继续攀升。本周的财报将告诉我们很多信息，降息对市场也非常有利。现在是投资的好时机。
*   **Matt:** 我不相信现金。我通常是满仓投资，每次拿到薪水都会尽可能多地投入市场。我确实觉得市场有些疲态，但还没到见顶的程度。我认为在真正转向之前，我们还有5%到10%的上涨空间。这意味着市场可能还有500点的上涨潜力，我可以看到我们达到7250点，然后才会出现较大规模的回调。

<p class="english-text">Tanner: I think by Thursday we're going to see more than a quarter of the S&P 500 earnings be updated just in those five names Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That's 24.6% of the total waitings of the S&P 500. So if they all shine, if everything goes through as expected, then we could see an explosive rally. And I do actually think that we're going to see north of 7,000 by the end of the year. So I remain bullish and all my chips are on the table. I mean, I can't find any cash anymore.<br><br>Steve: It's going I mean, look, how can I change my opinion, right? I was at 7,000 the beginning of the year. I've been 7,000 the whole time. I'm not revising it down. I'm not revising up. I'm just sticking at 7,000.<br><br>Roy: I mean, pretty much everything is very bullish. I'm like Tanner. I have very little cash left. Uh, probably 1% cash at this point and it's probably going to be deployed this week. The roller coaster is still in full operation. There's real underlying momentum in the market. As long as earnings are good, Tander said it best there. And so this week I think really tells us that rate cuts also very good for the markets too. So it's a good time to be invested.<br><br>Matt: Yeah, I don't I don't believe in cash. I'm normally fully invested and every paycheck that I get, I generally put all that as much as I can feasibly into the markets. But I mean, I do feel like we're getting a little tired here, but I don't think that it's tired enough where we're going to see it top out. I do think that we still have another 5 to 10% to go before we really turn over. So, I feel that that means that we have another potentially 500 points potentially to go in the market. So, I can see us getting to 7250 before we really start to see some sort of large retracement.</p>
