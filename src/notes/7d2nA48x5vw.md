### 市场概览：标普500指数创历史新高

好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》直播节目。今天股市发生了很多事情，有很多不同的头条新闻，我们必须谈谈其中一些刚刚出炉的消息。此外，盘后还有一些财报公布，其中一些来自半导体领域，这也将非常重要。所以，我们将关注这些动态并继续分析。到目前为止，朋友们，根据我们所看到的情况，今天似乎将以一个上涨日结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. Uh we got a bunch of different things going on in regards to the equity markets. A lot of different headlines. We got to talk about some of these headlines that just came in. Also, we've got some earnings after the belt. Some of them in the semiconductor space, which is going to be really important as well. Uh so, we're going to take a look at that and keep going from there. I mean, so far, folks, based on what we're seeing, looks like we're going to end out on a green day.</p>
</details>

看起来我们将以……哇，我过去30分钟都没看标普指数。我不仅没看到它触及684点，它现在是684.90点，几乎触及了685点。哇，真是了不起的一天。我完全没预料到，但事实就是如此。我确实看到谷歌股价达到了270美元，或者说接近270美元。现在是269.74美元，略低于那个价位，在269.02美元。所以，谷歌今天表现出色。特斯拉一度达到460美元，之后出现了一些抛售。目前特斯拉股价为440美元。Palantir，希望我们能收在190美元，即使没有，收在189美元以上也非常好，日内上涨了2.8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Looks like we're going to end out on a Wow, I didn't even see S&P for the past 30 minutes. Not only did I not see it hit 684. It's at 68490. It almost touched 685. Wow, what a day. I did not see that, but there you go. I did see Google get to 270. Right now, it's just or get close to 270. It's at 26974, just below that at 26902. So, Google having a great day. Tessy got to 460 at one point before a little bit of a sell-off right there. Tesla right now at 440 pound here. Hopefully we get that 190 close even if we don't above 189 is very nice. That's up 2.8% on the day.</p>
</details>

Robin Hood 今天表现不错，股价一度达到149美元，几乎回到150美元，现在是147美元。Grab 有所突破，上涨了4%，股价达到6.10美元。AMD 上涨2.2%。高通一度涨幅更大，但回吐了50%的涨幅。它曾上涨20%，现在上涨10%，原因是他们发布了一款可能对AMD和英伟达构成威胁的新芯片。市场似乎在消息公布后清醒过来，觉得“嘿，也许威胁没那么大。”所以它回吐了一些涨幅，但总的来说，今天市场整体表现相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood great day got to 149 almost back to 150 147. Grab a little bit of a breakout up 4%. You got 610 on Grab. AMD up 2.2%. Qualcomm which was up more at one point gave back 50% of the gains. It was up 20%. Now it's up 10% based on them unveiling a new chip that potentially could be a threat to AMD and Nvidia. It's almost like the market woke up after the announcement and said, "Hey, maybe it's not that big of a threat." Uh, so that one gave back some of the gains, but still pretty good day across the board.</p>
</details>

苹果上涨4%，Circle上涨0.5%，Pinterest、NHS、微软、Palo Alto Networks 都在上涨。以太坊达到4200美元，日内曾小幅下跌，但仍然触及了4200。Bitmain 股价为54.30美元，终于突破了50美元的水平，上周还在47美元。很高兴看到它进入50美元区间的中部，希望未来几天能收在55到56美元的范围内。SMCI 从上周10%的跌幅中反弹。比特币略低于115,000美元。总的来说，今天整个市场表现相当不错，在这些不同板块中没有看到太多疲软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apples up 4%, Circle's up half a percent, Pinterest is up, NHS is up, Microsoft, PaloAlto Networks, Ethereum 4,200, just went slightly red on the day, but still touched 42. You got Bit Mine right there 5430. Bit mine finally breaking above that 50 level. It was at 47 last week. So, nice to see it into the mid-50s and hopefully we can get a close uh into that 55 56 range over the coming days. SMCI up from the 10% decline that it had last week. Bitcoin right there just below 115. I mean, overall, it's been a pretty decent day across the entire board and you're not seeing that much weakness across some of these different sectors.</p>
</details>

HIMS 在哪里？Hims，好的，HIMS 表现出一些疲软，股价下跌。今天下跌的股票名单很短，其他很多股票都在上涨。Rocket Lab 是绿色的，上涨了1.3%。ASST，这是 Mike Alfred 新建仓的股票，今天上涨了54%。所以如果你买入了，只要不是在180美元附近买的，你可能都赚钱了。它现在是169美元，今天大部分时间都在130到140美元之间徘徊。所以这里出现了一些突破，并且继续上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is HIMS? Hims, okay, HIMS is showing some weakness. That one's down. Again, there's a short list of stocks that actually are red today. A lot of the other stocks are green. Rocket Lab is green. That's up 1.3%. ASST. This was the new name that Mike Alfred took a position in. That's up 54% on the day. So, if you got in it, I mean, you're probably up if you didn't buy anywhere near the 180s right now at 169. It was kind of hovering around 130, 140 for the majority of the day. So, a bit of a breakout right there. And that one continues to go green.</p>
</details>

### 焦点板块：稀土股承压

今天受到冲击的一个板块不幸的是这些稀土股。TMQ 下跌15%，MP 下跌7%，US Critical Metals 下跌15%。这很大程度上是因为，如果与中国的紧张关系不像我们想象的那么糟糕，那么美国国内对供应商的需求就不会那么大。即使它对更广泛的供应链行业，特别是半导体和电子产品领域仍然至关重要，但可能不会像市场预期的那么巨大。所以这种叙事发生了一些转变，这就是为什么这些股票出现了一些下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one sector that is getting hit today is unfortunately these rare earth stocks. TMQ down 15, MP down seven, US down eight, critical metals down 15. Uh a lot of this due to the fact that if tensions with China are not going to be as bad as we thought, the domestic demand for suppliers in the United States is not going to be as large. And even if it is going to be super important for the broader industry of supply chains, particularly around semiconductors and electronics, it might not be as massive as what the market had expected. And so that narrative has shifted a bit and that's why you have a bit of decline on those names.</p>
</details>

其他所有股票今天基本上都是上涨的，所以你看到了一些势头。是的，甚至 Dutch Bros 也在上涨。现在，让我们来看第一个故事。距离今天收盘还有11分钟。Dutch Bros 上涨了5.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everything else pretty much green on the day. So you're seeing some momentum. Yeah, even Dutch Bros. Even Dutch Bros picking up on the green. Now, let's get into the first story. We've got 11 minutes until the market closes today. Dutch Bros right there at 5.7%.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报前瞻

我认为我们大多数人都会关注的关键财报是 Cadence Design Systems，这是一个非常重要的公司。Celestica 也有财报。如果我没记错的话，Confluent 也有财报？是的，Confluent，这是一家软件公司，他们有财报，今年以来下跌了21%。Cadence，另一家大公司，股票代码 CDNS。然后是 Amcor，他们今天也有财报。这是我们相当一部分人感兴趣的公司。过去几周我们一直在谈论它，股价从28.50美元涨到了33美元。所以，我们将看看他们今天的财报结果如何。Cadence 今天上涨了18%。是的，还有 NXPI。NXPI 也很重要，我们也应该关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The key earnings that I think most of us are going to be looking at are uh Cadence, Cadence Design Systems, that's a very important one. Celestica, they have earnings. Uh Confluent, if I'm not wrong, do they have earnings? Yes, Confluent, that's a software name, they have earnings. They're down 21% for the year. Uh Cadence, another big company, CDNS. And then Amcor, uh they also have earnings today. So that's one that a decent chunk of us are interested in. Talked about that over the past couple weeks. up from 2850 to 33. So, we're going to see what their earnings turn out to today. Cadence right there up 18% on the day. Yes. And then NXPI. NXPI as well. That one is uh also a big one that we should look at.</p>
</details>

感谢大家的生日祝福，非常感谢。我会在节目快结束时再回复超级留言。如果你感兴趣，我们会留下来，在收盘后会有一个小小的赠品活动和一些有趣的环节。Steve 大约会在4:30上线。所以我们会邀请一些人上来，做一些有趣的事情，庆祝一下。SoFi 明天发布财报，那也很重要。我们会和 Steve 聊聊他对 SoFi 明天财报的一些看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you everybody for the happy birthday wishes. Appreciate it a ton. I'll get to the super chats again near the end of the show. We're going to stick around if you are interested and we'll have a little bit of a giveaway and some fun uh after the market close. Steve will be on around 4:30. So, we'll get some people on. We'll do some fun stuff and uh yeah, we'll celebrate the day. SoFi tomorrow, that's also important. We'll talk with Steve about some of his thoughts on SoFi going into tomorrow.</p>
</details>

### 重大新闻：亚马逊计划裁员三万名企业员工

现在，在我们接近收盘时，最大的头条新闻是亚马逊。显然，亚马逊正在缩减规模。报道称，他们强调将裁减3万个企业职位。这可能不一定是因为人工智能，因为如果是的话，老实说有点吓人。但这可能更多是由于组织重组。我们来简单报道一下，然后继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the big headline uh as we get into the close is Amazon, folks. Apparently, Amazon is uh well, they're downsizing. Report says they are highlighting 30,000 corporate jobs being cut. And this might not be due to necessarily to AI because if it is that's kind of scary to be honest. Uh but it might be more due to just organizational restructuring. A little bit of coverage on this and then uh then we'll keep going from there</p>
</details>

> 在未来几个月内。那是 Steve Leeman，现在加入我们的是 Intelligent Alpha 的 Doug Clinton，他将带来更多反应。这主要是亚马逊在审视其员工队伍，看看哪里可以提高效率。你知道，在这个人人都在讨论人工智能是否能取代工作的时刻，发生了一件有趣的事情。各大公司都在审视并说：“哪些地方我们可能只需要两名员工而不是五名？”然后他们决定在这些地方裁员。他们还把人工智能当作借口，当他们在某些业务部门遇到困难或表现不佳需要裁员时，他们会说：“嗯，我们将利用人工智能来提高效率。”而实际上他们无论如何都需要裁员。我不是说这正是亚马逊正在发生的事情，但我确实认为这遵循了经济中许多公司的趋势，要么放缓招聘，要么裁减员工，并且，你知道，可能会对这是人工智能的原因使个眼色，就像 Jassy 在他今年早些时候写的信中所做的那样。当你仔细看时，你并没有看到工作被一对一地自动化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> too in in coming months. That's that's Steve Leeman for joining us now with more reaction. Intelligent Alpha's Doug Clinton. This is largely Amazon taking a look at its workforce and seeing where it can be more efficient. You know, something interesting has happened with this moment where everybody's talking about whether AI can replace jobs. Companies by and large have looked and they've said, "Where are the places where we might need maybe two employees working instead of five?" And they've decided to cut there. They've also used AI as an excuse uh as a excuse for when they're suffering or not doing great in certain business units and need to um cut down. And they say they say, "Well, we're going to look at AI to make us more efficient." Uh where they just needed to do layoffs anyway. I'm not saying that's exactly what's happening with Amazon, but I do think that this is following a trend of many companies within the economy, either slowering hiring or cutting workforce and, you know, maybe winking at the fact that it's AI like Jasse might have done with his uh letter uh that he wrote earlier this year. Um where when you look at it, you don't see onetoone automation of jobs. So for me,</p>
</details>

那么，大家怎么看？作为亚马逊的股东，显然，如果你削减工作岗位，就削减了成本和开支，这对净利润率和营业利润率都有好处，显然也对 **EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）增长有好处。亚马逊今天股价上涨了1.3%。但我很好奇他们究竟为什么要裁掉3万个职位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so what do we think folks? I mean, look, as an Amazon shareholder, obviously it, you know, if you cut jobs, you cut costs, you cut expenses, that's good for, uh, net income margins, good for operating income margins, obviously good for EPS growth. Amazon right there up 1.3% on the day. But I am curious why exactly they are trying to go for 30,000 jobs.</p>
</details>

### 多头主导市场，苹果市值逼近四万亿

哇，看看苹果。这可能是标普指数上涨的另一个原因。苹果股价268美元，标普指数685点。天哪，685点。朋友们，多头正在获胜，就这么简单。他们在10月10日遇到了一点小挫折，一个价值200亿美元的加密货币清算小插曲。但多头做了什么？他们逢低买入。美国银行表示，10月10日星期五是历史上第五大单只股票流入日。他们确实逢低买入了。当天交易了6800万份看涨期权，其中很多可能是在下跌势头中买入的。所以标普500指数达到了685点。天哪，离690点只差5美元，离7000点不到2%。绝对令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow, look at Apple. This is probably another reason why the S&P is moving. Apple right there 268, S&P 685. Oh my goodness. 685. Dude, the Bulls are winning. It's just that simple. The Bulls are winning. They had a little bit of a hiccup on October 10th. A little bit of a $20 billion crypto liquidation hiccup. But then what did the Bulls do? They bought the dip. Bank of America said Friday, October 10th was the fifth largest inflow for single stocks in history. I mean, they bought the dip. 68 million calls were traded that day. A lot of those likely on the buy side as um as we had any momentum to the downside. So 685 right there on the S&P 500. My goodness, that's five bucks away from 690. Less than 2% away from 7,000 on the S&P. Absolutely incredible.</p>
</details>

苹果在这里也做出了贡献，股价可能要冲向270美元，现在是268.40美元，日内又上涨了2%。苹果是一家大公司，所以2%的涨幅确实很重要。特斯拉股价452美元。AMD上涨2.3%。SoFi正试图收于30美元。纳斯达克100指数（QQQ）达到628点，创历史新高，上涨1.8%，继续攀升。谷歌，我们触及270美元了吗？非常接近270美元，但谷歌和苹果都在上涨。它们都是标普500指数的重要组成部分，还有英伟达。英伟达上涨了3%，股价191.42美元。在高通消息出来后有点小波折，但市场不太在意。所以英伟达股价在191美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You got Apple right here helping to contribute. Apple potentially going for 270. 26840. That's up another 2% of the day. Apple's a big company, so 2% on Apple really does matter. Tesla right here 452. AMD that's up 2.3. And then SoFi trying to get that $30 close. The Q's 628 alltime high on the Q's up 1.8% continuing to make a move. You got Google. Are we touching 270 yet? On the Googs, we are very close to touching 270, but Google and Apple moving. Both of them big parts of the S&P 500 along with Nvidia. I mean, Nvidia's up 3%. 19142. Had a bit of a hiccup after that Qualcomm news came out, but markets didn't care too much. And that's why you got Nvidia right there at 191.</p>
</details>

苹果市值达到4万亿美元了吗？苹果非常接近了，朋友们。可能股价只差40美分，不到一美元就能达到4万亿美元。市值3.984万亿美元。朋友们，如果我们在2025年看到两家4万亿美元的公司，作为投资者，我们正经历一个多么非凡的时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is Apple at 4 trillion? Is Apple at 4 trillion? Apple's really close, guys. It's probably what, 40 cents away. Not even a full dollar away in terms of share price to getting to 4 trillion. 3.984 trillion. Dude, if we see uh two4 trillion companies in 2025, I mean, what a remarkable period to live through as investors. What a remarkable period to live through as investors.</p>
</details>

Tim Apple，宝贝。Lemonade 在动吗？Lemonade 是绿色的。哇，今天上涨了11%。看，一些保险股有所回升。Oscar 也上涨了2%。也许是对政府关门的担忧有所缓解，这让这些股票兴奋起来。UNH 早上还是红的，最终转绿了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tim Apple, baby. Tim Apple lemonade. Is that moving? Lemonade is green. Wow. 11% on the day. Look at that. Some of the insurance names picking up a little bit. Oscar right there. That's also up 2%. Maybe some capitulation on the shutdown, which is getting some of these names excited. UNH was red in the morning. UNH ended up going green. UNH ended up going green.</p>
</details>

**恐惧与贪婪指数**（Fear & Greed Index: 一种衡量市场情绪的指标）在哪里？这是个好问题。恐惧与贪婪指数在这里。哇，我们仍然处于恐惧状态。我们仍然处于恐惧状态。市场创下历史新高，而且幅度相当大。这不仅仅是一个小小的历史新高。之前的历史高点是673.95点，我们现在是685点，但市场情绪仍然是恐惧。那么贪婪会是什么样子？贪婪会是7100点、7200点还是什么？如果是这样，那我们还有很长的路要走，朋友们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is the fear and greed index? That's a good question. Fear and greed right here. Wow. We are still at fear. We are still at fear. All-time highs on the market by a pretty wide margin. It's not just the small all-time high. The previous alltime high was 673.95. We are at 685 and still have fear. I mean what does greed look like? Is greed gonna be 7100 7200 or something? Because if that's the case, we got a long way to go folks. We have got a long way to go to see how this plays out.</p>
</details>

甚至 Nebius 也在上涨。Nebius、CoreWeave，很多这些数据中心公司。看，Nebius 股价125美元，日内上涨8%。CoreWeave 上涨2%，股价135美元。IN 也表现不错，上涨3%。并非所有比特币矿商今天都上涨了。Terawolf、Hive、Bit Farms 和 Cipher 下跌了，但 CleanSpark、IREN、Marathon、Riot、Galaxy 都在上涨。所以你有很多这些公司仍在上涨，这还不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even Nebus making a move. Nebius, Cory, a lot of these data center names. Look at that. Nebas right there. 125. That's up 8% on the day. Cororeeve that's up 2% 135. IN uh also doing well up 3%. Not all the Bitcoin miners went green today. You got Terowolf, Hive, Bit Farms, and Cipher that went down, but Clean Spark's up. I ran is up. Marathon's up. Riots's up. Galaxy ups. So, you got a lot of these names that are still going green as well, which is not is not too bad.</p>
</details>

我认为过去几周的故事确实是财报的进展，我们将在周三看到更多财报，我们将看看故事如何发展。但银行股表现出色，消费品公司也表现出色，餐厅业也不算太差。如果这种情况能持续下去，市场就有更多理由扩大其市盈率。更不用说我们很快就要迎来降息了，那将在周三发生。我认为市场也在为这次降息做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I think the story of the past couple weeks really has been earnings progression, and we're going to get a lot more earnings on Wednesday, and we're going to see how the story plays out. But the banks have crushed it, consumer companies have crushed it, uh restaurants have not been too bad. So, if that can continue, that is more of a reason for the market to expand its multiple. Not to mention the fact we've got a rate cut coming up pretty soon. That's going to be on Wednesday. And I think the markets are also getting ready for what that rate cut is going to look like.</p>
</details>

今天的大新闻是亚马逊裁员3万。我们可能会在未来几周获得更多细节。但这些是企业职位，不是工厂或仓库里的人。所以这些更像是亚马逊正在考虑裁掉的白领工作，这将是他们组织的一次彻底重组。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the big story of the day was Amazon and that 30,000 uh job cut. We're going to get more details on that probably over the coming weeks. But you do, and these are corporate jobs. These aren't people in the factories in the warehouses. So these are more so like white collar jobs that Amazon is thinking of getting rid of, which again would be a total restructuring of their organization.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，特斯拉，巨鲸们今天以及过去几周购买了价值数百万美元的看涨期权。我们一直在关注2025年11月到期的525至550美元行权价的期权。今天有更多2026年6月到期的560美元行权价的期权被买入。所以有相当多的人在买入那些特斯拉看涨期权。特斯拉的财报不是最好的，但归根结底，没有太多方法能像特斯拉那样让你接触到人工智能。而且华尔街似乎并不在乎。此外，即使在财报发布后，特斯拉获得的评级上调也普遍看涨。今天 Canaccord Genuity 将其评级从385美元上调至510美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tesla, by the way, Wales bought millions worth of calls today and over the past couple weeks. We've been eyeing that 525 to 550 strike for November 2025. A lot more of the 560s were bought today for June 2026. So you've got a decent amount of people buying up those Tesla calls. Now again, Tesla earnings wasn't the best, but at the end of the day, there's not that many ways to get exposure to AI in the way that Tesla gives you exposure. And it seems like the street doesn't care. Also, the upgrades that Tesla's been getting even after those earnings have been relatively bullish across the board. They got upgraded by Caner today to 510 from 385.</p>
</details>

所以，越来越多的人只是说：“看，我们真的不在乎数字不是那么好。我们不在乎有负的盈利增长。我们只在乎这个故事会按照我们认为的方式发展，我们愿意用今天的利润缺失来补贴这个故事，以换取未来指数级的更多利润。”这就是为什么特斯拉上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're getting a lot more people just saying, "Look, we really don't care that the numbers are not that good. We don't care that there's negative earnings growth. just care that this story is going to play out the way we think it's going to play out and we're willing to subsidize the story with a lack of profits today for exponentially more profits in the future. And that's why Tesla's green</p>
</details>

AMD 股价260美元，标普指数685.42点，基本上是日内高点。距离收盘还有三分钟，标普指数现在真的在发力，绝对令人难以置信。AMD 260美元，我们确实达到了……哦不，那是历史新高。我怎么会以为……哦，我想到的是谷歌。超过260美元，哇，那是AMD的历史新高。如果它收在260美元，现在是259.80美元。那是AMD的历史新高。天哪，有些股票的历史高点很难跟上。苹果股价268.88美元。苹果市值到4万亿了吗？苹果是3.984万亿。不，不，苹果是3.991万亿。如果不是今天，那可能就是这周了，只要他们财报好。苹果将达到4万亿。微软也一样，是的，3.954万亿。微软也没落后多少。

Apple's going to four trill. Microsoft as well. Yeah. 3.954. Microsoft's not uh not that far behind.</p>

哇，真是了不起的一天，伙计们。真是太棒了。这可能是那种让很多在过去几天里挣扎的投资组合恢复元气的日子。苹果股价正试图冲击269美元，它确实达到了269美元，并且你看到这股势头在继续。是的，我们也在看到全面的价格发现。甲骨文股价281美元，日内小幅下跌。英伟达仍然上涨2.83%。

Apple right there trying to hit 269. It did hit 269 and you're continuing to see this move. Yeah, price discovery across the board is also something that we're seeing. Oracle right there 281. That's slightly down on the day. Nvidia still up 2.83.</p>

好了，我们开始吧。再次感谢大家来到这里。也感谢所有的生日祝福。我们将在收盘后做一些有趣的生日活动。我们会请 Steve 上节目。但深深地感谢在座的每一位。今天非常非常不可思议，看到这么多市场势头真是太好了，尤其是在过去几周我们都感受到了痛苦，经历了痛苦才换来了收益。看起来今天可能就是那个在几周痛苦之后的收益日。

<p class="english-text">All right, here we go. Thank you everybody for being here again. Thank you for all the birthday wishes as well. We'll uh do some fun birthday stuff after we get through the close. We'll have Steve on to the show. But deeply deeply appreciate everyone that's here. Uh pretty pretty incredible day and it is very very nice to see a lot of this market momentum after the past couple weeks we had where all of us felt the pain and got to go through some of the pain to get the gains. And it looks like today might be that day for gains after a couple weeks of pain. So there we go.</p>
</details>

是的，还有 Celestica。我们会关注 Celestica，并把它加入我们的财报名单。好了，我们开始吧。感谢大家来到这里。10月27日，星期一。我现在28岁了，股市现在收盘了。

<p class="english-text">Yes, Celestica as well. We'll look at Celestea and we'll put that on the list for the earnings that we got. All right, here we go. Thank everybody for being here. Monday, October 27th. I am now 28 years old and the stock market is now closed.</p>
</details>

好了，今天就这样结束了。Palantir 没能收在190美元，但我们一度达到192.83美元，收盘价是189美元。我接受这个结果。Palantir 与波兰国防部签署了意向书，Lumen 合同价值2亿美元。所以在过去几周，Palantir 有很多不同的催化剂朝着正确的方向发展。Palantir 收盘价189.14美元，日内上涨2.44%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, there you go. We are done for the day. Paler did not give us the 190 close, but we got to 192 at one point. 19283. Closed at 189. I'll take it. I will take it. Again, pounder signed that letter of intent with the defense ministry of Poland. Lumen contract was $200 million. So you had a lot of different catalysts going the right direction for pounder over the past couple weeks. 18914 on pounder. That's up 2.44% on the day.</p>
</details>

Robin Hood 收盘上涨4%，一度接近149美元，收于146美元。特斯拉今天表现出色，上涨4%，收于452美元。英伟达回到190美元区间，上涨2.8%。标普500指数收于685点以上。如果你一直看空，真的很难理解，在所有可以提出的看空论点下，看到标普指数不仅创下历史新高，而且是大幅超越之前的历史高点。这相当令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin Hood ends out the day at 4% almost was at 149 closed at 146. Tessy great day 4% 452. Nvidia back into the 190s 2.8%. S&P 500 closes above 685. Again, if I if you've been bearish, it's really hard to see that with all the bearish arguments one could make to see the S&P go not only at an all-time high, but a, you know, a real uh degree of magnitude of above alltime highs or at least above the previous all-time highs. It's quite incredible.</p>
</details>

然后你还有美联储降息和即将到来的财报。标普500指数中最重要的公司，其中43%将在本周公布财报。但最重要的那些，也就是所谓的“七巨头”，将在两天后公布。如果他们交出好的财报，天知道会发生什么。也许7000点并不遥远，因为降息即将到来，然后你还有可能带来更多动力的盈利增长。

<p class="english-text">And then you've got the Fed cutting rates and earnings coming up. The most important companies in the S&P 500, 43% of them are reporting earnings this week.

Maybe that 7,000 is not that far away as you've got rate cuts coming down the corner and then you got earnings growth potentially leading to more momentum.</p>

AMD 收盘价创历史新高，或略低于历史新高，上涨2.68%，报259美元。SoFi 终于收在了30美元，还不错。谷歌收于268.95美元，略低于269美元。Grab 收于6.11美元，上周还在5.40美元。所以和很多股票一样，它之前在打折，对于那些抓住机会的人来说还不错。Reddit 上涨2.3%。亚马逊上涨1.3%。Meta 上涨1.6%，三个月来首次达到750美元。ELF 上涨2.74%。苹果收于268.78美元，基本上是收盘历史新高。

SMCI 也上涨了7%。BMR 我们到54美元了吗？BMR 收于53.60美元，上涨6.32%，还不错。IREN 上涨3%。辉瑞小幅上涨。阿里巴巴上涨2.4%。VIX 指数今天下跌4%，对股市非常有利。Lyft 上涨0.5%。黄金早上是下跌的，现在仍然下跌，日内基本下跌3%，报39.91美元。白银报46.78美元。这就是今天的情况。

### 财报深度解析：Cadence、Amcor 与 Whirlpool

好了，财报。我们来看看。Amcor 盘后小幅上涨，我还没有拿到财报结果。Confluent 下跌了。NXPI 持平。然后 Cadence 也基本持平。Celestica 是我们关注的另一家公司。让我看看能不能拿到这些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, earnings. Let's get into it. What do we got? What do we have on earnings? Let's get into it. Amcor getting a little bit of green after hours. I don't have the results yet. Confluent is up or Confluent's down. NXPI is flat. And then Cadence is slightly flat. Uh Celestica is another one we have. Let me see if I can get these numbers.</p>
</details>

哦，今天还有惠而浦（Whirlpool）的财报。好的，我也会把它加到名单上。这对消费领域很重要。Amcor 正试图冲向34美元。我还没有数据，但让我马上找一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, we have Whirlpool today. Okay, I'll put that on the list as well. Uh, that'll be important for the consumer. Amcore trying to push 34 right here. Don't have the numbers, but let me get them in a second and see what we've got.</p>
</details>

好的，Cadence。我拿到 Cadence 的数据了。每股收益1.93美元，同比增长17%，超出预期。营收13.9亿美元。Cadence 看起来营收和利润都超出了预期。盘后股价小幅持平转跌，跌幅非常小，没什么大不了的。但这是一个营收和利润双双超预期的财报。利润超出预期8%，营收超出1%。每股收益1.93美元对1.79美元，营收13.9亿对13.2亿美元。营收同比增长10%，每股收益同比增长18%。他们做芯片设计，是一家重要的公司，市值950亿美元。所以这是一家百亿级公司，绝不是小公司，但股价小幅上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Cadence. I got Cadence. Here we go. Cadence beat EPS 193, up from 17% on a beat year-over-year. And then revenue 1.39 billion. Cadence looks like they beat on the top and the bottom. Uh, this one is slightly flat after hours to red. It's a very slight red. Nothing too crazy, but that is great. But that is a beat on the top and the bottom. Beat by 8% and then beat by 1%. 193 versus 179. 1.3 versus 1.32 billion. Revenue is up 10% year-over-year. EPS is up 18% year-over-year. These guys do chip design. It's an important company. Market cap is 200 or 95 billion. Um, so you know, $100 billion company, not a small company by any means, but that one is slightly up.</p>
</details>

我拿到了 Amcor 的数据。净销售额19.9亿美元，毛利润2.84亿美元，营业利润1.59亿美元，净利润1.27亿美元，每股收益51美分。我认为这符合预期。**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）为3.4亿美元。股价基本持平，报32.15美元，没有大的波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I have this. Okay. Net income or net sales 1.99 billion. Gross profit 284 million. Operating income 159. Net income 127. EPS of 51 cents. I think that came in line with expectations. EBID of 340 million. stock is basically flat 3215 not really seeing a big move up or down.</p>
</details>

Confluent 上涨了7%。我稍后会提供更多关于这些财报的信息，但 Amcor 相对平稳。Confluent 上涨9%，那只股票在动。惠而浦也小幅上涨。CLS Celestica 也在动。然后 NXPI 也上涨了0.5%。是的，Amcor 实现了双重超预期。CEO 表示，Amcor 第三季度营收达到19亿美元，增长31%，受先进封装需求推动，该业务创下新的营收记录。本季度，我们执行了陡峭的产能爬坡，在通信和计算终端市场实现了创纪录的营收，并在亚利桑那州的新先进封装和测试园区破土动工，加强了我们为客户技术路线图赋能和巩固美国半导体制造业的承诺。CEO 也将进行继任计划。所以看起来他们将任命其他人担任CEO职位。但营收和利润都超出了预期。股价上下波动，没有大的变动，基本持平。它全天都在33美元，盘后也是33美元。但确实有相当大的超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Confluent that's up 7%. I'll get more on those results in a second, but Amcor being relatively flat. Confluent that's up 9% that one moving. Royal pool that's up a little bit. CLS Celestica is moving as well. And then NXPI that is also up half%. Yeah, Amcore got a double beat. CEO says Amcor delivered third quarter revenue of 1.9 billion up 31% fueled by demand for advanced packaging which set a new revenue record. This quarter, we executed steep production ramps, achieved record revenue in our communications and computing and markets, and broke ground on our new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona, reinforcing our commitment to enable our customers technology roadmaps and strengthen US semiconductor manufacturing. Uh CEO will also be going through a succession plan. So, it looks like they're going to be putting someone else in the CEO position. But you got to beat on the top and the bottom. Stock is up and down, up and down. Not really making a big move. Basically flat. I mean, it was at 33 the whole day. Now it's at 33 after hours. But you do have a pretty big beat.</p>
</details>

Rambus，他们每股收益未达预期14%，为44美分，预期为51美分。营收1.78亿美元，预期1.75亿美元，超出2%。所以 Rambus 没有实现双重超预期，这只股票受到了打击。是的，Amcor，华尔街预期19.32亿美元，他们实现了19亿美元。每股收益，华尔街预期43美分，他们实现了51美分。这是一个不错的超预期。如果你持有这只股票，你可能对财报不会太失望，只是华尔街没有过分热情。另外，这只股票流动性不大，交易量也不大。所以现实情况是，他们只需要继续执行，最终数字会赶上股价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rambus right here, they missed by 14% on EPS. 44 cents versus 51 cents expected. 178 versus 175 million revenue. They beat by 2%. Okay, so Rambus did not have a double meep. This one's getting hit. And yeah, an Amcor Street wanted 1.932. They came in at 1.9 EPS. I mean, dude, the street wanted 43 cents. They came in at 51. It's a decent beat. It's a decent beat. I mean, if you own the stock, you're probably not too upset at the earnings. It's just the street's not overly enthusiastic. Also, this name doesn't have a ton of liquidity. It doesn't have a ton of volume. So realistically, it's more so them just having to keep executing and eventually the numbers catch up with the with the with the stock price as well.</p>
</details>

惠而浦，这将告诉我们更多关于消费者的信息。我还没看到他们的财报。我对那个肯定很感兴趣。你会看到很多洗碗机和洗衣机。天哪，那是个惊人的超预期。哇，惠而浦营收预期39.2亿美元，他们实现了40.3亿美元。所以他们营收超预期。他们实现了5000万美元的季度成本削减。调整后每股收益为2.29美元，而预期为1.43美元。朋友们，那是个不错的季度，特别是因为他们也容易受到关税的影响。该股票年初至今已经下跌了35%。所以任何好消息对他们来说都是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whirlpool, this will tell us a little bit more about the consumer. I don't see their earnings yet. That one I am definitely interested in. Lots of dishes and washing machines is what you would see. Oh my, that's a hell of a beat. Wow. Whirlpool 3.92 billion. They came in at 4.03. So they beat on revenue. They achieved 50 million in quarterly cost reductions. Uh adjusted EPS was $29 versus a $143 expected. I mean, dude, that is not a bad quarter, especially because they are also prone to tariffs. The stock is already down 35% year-to date. So, any piece of good news would be good for them.</p>
</details>

> 惠而浦财报出炉，盈利大幅超出预期。营收也高于预期。公司还上调了全年指引，称正在应对关税带来的短期不利影响。特别是，它表示正受到亚洲竞争对手库存加载的影响。你可以看到那些股票现在上涨了约1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Whirlpool earnings are out and it's a big beat on earnings. Revenue also coming in better than expected. Company also raising guidance for the full year, saying it is navigating the near-term unfavorable effects of tariffs. In particular, saying it's being impacted by inventory loading from Asian competitors. You can see those shares are up about 1% right now.</p>
</details>

Welltower，他们业绩相当差。我其实不知道这家公司是做什么的。每股收益41美分，预期51美分，未达预期20%。营收未达预期1%。他们营收27亿美元。所以我想这是一家相关公司，市值1220亿美元。投资于医疗基础设施的**REIT**（Real Estate Investment Trust: 房地产投资信托基金）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, also missed, this is another company. Let me pull this up. Uh, Well, Tower, they missed pretty badly. I actually don't know what this company does. 41 cents versus 51 cents. That's a miss by 20%. Revenue missed by 1%. They're doing 2.7 billion in revenue. So, I would imagine this is a relevant company. $122 billion market cap. Real estate investment trusts that invest in healthcare infrastructure.</p>
</details>

Celestica，那只股票刚刚在动吗？Celestica，我想那只股票在动。好的，砰。你刚刚在盘后看到 Celestica 动了5%。我想他们的财报刚刚出来。所以，Celestica 给你带来了一些波动，但其他一切都相对平稳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Celestica, is that one moving just now? Celestea, I think that one's moving. Okay. Boom. You're just getting a move right now after hours on Celestica 5%. I think their earnings just came out. So, Celestea giving you a bit of a move, but everything else been relatively flat.</p>
</details>

哇，相当大的超预期。每股收益1.58美元，预期1.49美元，超出6%。每股收益同比增长50%。营收31.9亿美元，预期30.4亿美元。营收超出5%。营收同比增长近30%，为28%。为多伦多争光，给我们带来了一些财报动力。看那个，上涨了9%。该股票已经上涨了225%。我觉得我们从来不谈论 Celestica。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, wow. Pretty big beat. 158 versus 149. 6% EPS beat. EPS is up 50% year-over-year. Revenue 3.19 versus 3.04. Revenues beat by 5%. Revenues up almost 30%, 28% year-over-year. Shout out to T Dot giving us some earnings momentum. Look at that. Up 9%. The stock was already up 225. I feel like we never talk about Celestica.</p>

### 市场动态与政治影响

顺便说一句，南希·佩洛西今天卖掉了一些她的苹果股票，但她并没有真正卖掉。她像是把它赠予了某个大学之类的。她仍然持有价值约3000万美元的苹果股票，但她今天卖掉了大约25万美元。所以，如果你看到标题说她卖了，她确实卖了，但也不完全是那种意义上的卖出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Nancy Pelosi sold some of her Apple today, but she didn't really sell. She kind of like gifted it to some university or something. She still owns like $30 million worth of Apple, but she sold like 250,000 of it today. So, if you're seeing a headline saying that she sold, she kind of did, but she also didn't necessarily sell in that way.</p>
</details>

说到政治家，这里还有一个更新。丹·纽豪斯在8月17日买入了AMD，这是他有史以来第一次购买AMD。他在众议院能源拨款小组委员会任职。今天，能源部宣布与AMD达成一项10亿美元的合作，建造两台超级计算机。所以，我们不是说他知道能源部会给AMD一个10亿美元的合作项目，即使他在众议院能源拨款小组委员会任职。我们只是说他是一个非常出色的选股人。你知道，当你看到这种事情时，这就是其中的暗示。所以，向丹·纽豪斯先生致敬，因为他在选股方面确实有一套。AMD今天达到历史新高260美元，盘后报259.75美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, speaking of politicians, here's an update as well. Dan New House bought AMD on August 17th, his first ever buy of AMD. He serves on the House Appropriation Subcommittee on Energy. Today, the Department of Energy announced a $1 billion partnership with AMD to build two supercomputers. So again, we're not saying he knew that the Department of Energy would give AMD a billion dollar partnership even if he serves on the House Appropriations of Subcommittee on Energy. We're just saying he's a phenomenal stock picker. And you know that that is the implication from when you see this type of stuff. So shout out to Mr. Dan New House for knowing his [ __ ] when it comes to picking stocks. AMD reaching that all-time high at 260 today, 25975 after hours.</p>
</details>

Confluent，营收2.98亿美元，订阅收入2.86亿美元，GAAP每股净亏损19美分，我认为这比预期的要好。Confluent CEO表示：“Confluent本季度表现强劲，Confluent云收入同比增长24%，剩余履约义务同比增长43%并加速增长。我们也看到我们平台的数据流处理（DSP）组件的采用正在加速。”云收入为1.61亿美元，同比增长24%。“我们强劲的第三季度业绩突显了我们数据流平台的势头和我们多元化的增长战略。我们稳健的营收增长、稳定的基于美元的净留存率以及持续的利润率扩张，证明了我们有能力在长期内推动持久且盈利的增长。”看起来华尔街也喜欢这些数字。

Looks like the street is liking these numbers as well.</p>
</details>

Waste Management，财报出来了。看起来营收未达预期。股价下跌了5%。预期65.31亿美元，实际为64亿美元。每股收益1.98美元，预期2.04美元。Waste Management 的业绩未达预期。这家公司今年表现并不算最好，上涨了6%。它不应该有剧烈波动，你知道，它支付稳定的股息，但每次有机会真正突破时，它都没有交出最好的财报。这与他们上个季度的未达预期非常相似。所以 Waste Management 营收和利润双双未达预期。我不认为收垃圾存在需求问题，我认为这可能更多是公司内部的运营效率问题导致了这些糟糕的利润率，这就是你看到股价下跌的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But waste management, folks. There you go. You got your revenue. Uh looks like it's a miss. Stocks down 5% right here. 6.4 came in at 6 point or 6.531. It came in at 6.4. EPS 198 versus 204. Uh it got a bit of a miss on waste management. This stock has it's not really been doing the best this year. It's up six%. It's not supposed to move like crazy. You know, it pays a consistent dividend, but uh every opportunity it's had to really break out. It's it's just not delivered the best earnings. This is very similar to the miss they had last quarter. So, you got a double miss on waste management. I I don't think there's a demand problem for picking up trash. I think this might be more operational efficiencies inside of the company that led to these bad margins and that's why you're getting some pain right there.</p>

Steve: 是的，我的意思是，看，它会是一个好季度吗？是的。它会很快涨到45美元吗？我仍然持怀疑态度，但如果他们明天公布一百万新增会员，我想那会很快改变我的看法。当他们进行稀释时，Tanner 和我对此都非常看好，尽管 X 上的很多人不这么认为。所以我确实认为他们有能力交出一份好的季度报告。而且我非常感兴趣的是关于降息以及他们在房地产市场看到的评论。所以，我们拭目以待。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, look, can it be a good quarter? Yes. Um, is it going to go to 45 anytime soon? I am still skeptical, but if they blow out a million members tomorrow, I mean, I think that's going to change my opinion pretty quickly. And when they did the dilution, Tanner and I were pretty bullish about it, even though a bunch of people on X weren't. So, I do think they're going to have the ability to put up a good quarter. And I'm very interested in what the commentary is around rate cuts and what they're seeing in the housing market. So, we'll see what happens.</p>

Amit: 好了，我问你们一个问题，然后就让你们走。再次，非常感谢你们能上节目。首先，我们直接问一个市场问题。我们轮流回答。标普指数创历史新高，盘后仍在上涨，基本上是686点，685.95点。Tanner，我们从你开始。对市场最近的表现有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So I'll ask you guys one question then I'll let you guys leave. again. Really appreciate you guys even hopping on to the show. Um, first of all, let's just let's just do a straight up market question. We'll go around the room. Alltime highs on the S&P still moving after hours basically 686 68595. Tanner, we'll start with you. Just reaction to the Oh, there you go. 686. Reaction to the market doing what it's been doing.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我认为到周四，我们将看到超过四分之一的标普500公司财报更新，仅仅是 Meta、谷歌、亚马逊、苹果和微软这五家公司。这占标普500总权重的24.6%。所以如果它们都表现出色，如果一切都如预期进行，那么我们可能会看到爆炸性的上涨。我确实认为到年底我们会看到指数超过7000点。所以我保持看涨，我的所有筹码都已入场。我的意思是，我再也找不到任何现金了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think uh you know by Thursday we're going to see more than a quarter of the S&P 500 earnings be updated just in those five names Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That's 24.6% of the total waitings of the S&P 500. So if they all shine, if if everything goes through as expected, then we could see an explosive rally. And I do actually think that we're going to see north of 7,000 by the end of the year. So I remain bullish and um yeah, all my chips are on the table. I mean, I can't find any cash anymore.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的。Steve，你在4800点时就预测7000点。我们现在非常接近了。你对这个市场有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Uh Steve, you are calling 7,000 at 4,800. We are awfully close. What are you thinking about this market?</p>
</details>

Steve: 我的意思是，看，我怎么能改变我的观点呢，对吧？我年初就看7000点，一直都是7000点。我不会下调，也不会上调。我就坚持7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, there you go. It's going I mean, look, how can I change my opinion, right? I was at 7,000 the beginning of the year. I've been 7,000 the whole time. I'm not revising it down. I'm not revising up. I'm just sticking at 7,000.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，Roy，你对降息、财报以及市场创历史新高的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, Roy, your thoughts on rate cuts, earnings, and the market hitting alltime highs.</p>
</details>

Roy: 我的意思是，几乎所有事情都非常看涨。当然，未来还有一些不确定的事情，但有些人持有大量现金或全部是现金。我和 Tanner 一样，我剩下的现金很少了，大概只有1%，而且可能这周就会投出去。过山车仍在全速运行。所以会有时开关关，受关税问题影响，但市场有真正的潜在动力。当然，关税问题得到解决，虽然还不是永久性的，但如果真是这样，只要财报好，就没有太多担忧能阻止牛市继续攀升。Tanner 说得最好。所以这周我认为真的告诉我们，降息对市场也非常好。所以现在是投资的好时机，很高兴我们所有人都几乎满仓了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I mean, pretty much everything is very bullish. There are, you know, some things further on the horizon that are not necessarily, but there are some that are sitting heavy in cash or all cash. Um, I'm like Tanner. I I have very little cash left. Uh, probably 1% cash at this point and it's probably going to be deployed this week. Um, you know, we we're the roller coaster is still in full operation. So, there will be times where on again, off again hits with tariff stuff, but there's real underlying momentum in the market. Uh, of course the the tariffs of being resolved. Uh, if you know it's it's not permanent yet, but if that's actually the case, there's not much in the term of worry uh to prevent the bull market from continuing to climb as long as earnings are good. Tander said it best there. Um, and so this week I think really tells us that rate cuts also very good for the markets too. So it's a good time to be invested and uh glad that all I think all of us are pretty much fully invested. So,</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，我喜欢。Matt Money，你觉得呢？我们会继续走高吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> all right. I love it. Matt money, what do you think? We're going higher.</p>
</details>

Matt: 是的，我不相信现金。所以聊天里有人说现金，我同意。我通常不相信现金，我通常是满仓的，每拿到一份薪水，我通常会尽可能多地投入市场。但我确实觉得我们在这里有点累了，但我不认为累到我们会见顶。我确实认为我们还有5%到10%的上涨空间，然后才会真正转向。所以，我觉得这意味着市场可能还有500点的上涨空间。所以我可以看到我们达到7250点，然后才会真正开始看到某种大的回调。我们开始看到一些效率提升。你刚看到亚马逊可能宣布裁员3万人。实际上，就在10到15分钟前，路透社的一篇文章发布了关于可能裁员3万人的消息。所以我认为人们正在努力寻找下一个能增加利润的来源。而且，再加上人工智能带来的效率提升，我认为我们还没有结束。这些公司，信不信由你，尽管每个人都认为标普500很贵，但 Steve 昨天在他的大型科技公司财报预览中以一种很好的方式阐述了，这些公司正在以相当快的速度增长。当你从2026年、2027年的远期来看，如果他们达到那些数字，他们实际上并不那么贵。而且这些都是将继续交付业绩的优质企业。所以，话虽如此，他们的资本支出快用完了。所以，在某种程度上，除非他们大规模增长，否则我确实认为你会开始看到一些增长放缓。但在我们做到这一点之前，我认为我们还有5%到10%的上涨空间，很容易，在我们看到一些回调之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I don't I don't believe in cash. Um, so somebody said cash uh in the chat. I agree with that. I I generally don't don't believe that I'm normally fully invested and every paycheck that I get, I I generally put all that as much as I can feasibly into the into the markets. But I mean, I do feel like we're getting a little tired here, but I don't think that it's tired enough where we're going to see it top out. I I do think that we still have another 5 to 10% to go before we really turn over. So, I feel that that means that we have another uh potentially uh 500 points potentially to go in the market. So, I can see us getting to 7250 um before we really start to see some sort of large retracement. Um you know, we started to see some efficiency gains. You just saw Amazon potentially announce 30,000 potential layoffs. Um, actually just like 10 15 minutes ago, an article, I think it was from Reuters, uh, released about potential 30,000 people laid off. So, I think people are really trying to find where that next dollar is coming from to hit the bottom line. And, um, you know, that coupled with efficiencies gained from AI, uh, I don't think that we're done here. And these companies, believe it or not, even though everyone's thinking the S&P 500's expensive, I mean, Steve went over it in a really good fashion yesterday on his uh big tech earnings kind of preview, these companies are growing at a pretty expansive rate. And um when you look at it on a forward, you know, 2026 2027 basis, if they hit the numbers, they're actually not that expensive. Um and and these are premium businesses that are going to continue to deliver. So, uh, but that being said, they're running out of capex. So, um, to an extent. So, unless they grow massively, uh, I do think that you'll start to see some growth slowdown. But before we do that, I think we have another, uh, 5 10% to go easily, um, before we, we see some, uh, retracement.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，我认为，当你说我们在这里有点累了，我同意，但这也像是我们刚刚经历了3%的回调。所以，你知道，也许那是疲劳的顶峰，市场需要把一些泡沫挤掉。你知道，SoFi 涨到了愚蠢的价格，很多这些公司都涨到了离谱的价格，现在我们看到了一些复苏，这并不意味着我们必须回到历史高点，但你开始看到一些更优质的公司回到了他们之前的活力。如果他们能跟上好的财报，你知道，也许那才是真正能让这次反弹持续下去的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And I think, you know, when you said we are getting a little tired here, I I would agree, but it's also like we just had that 3% draw down. So, you know, may maybe that was like peak tiredness and markets needed to get some of the froth wiped out of everything. You know, SoFi got to stupid prices. A lot of these companies just got to dumb prices and uh now we're getting a bit of recovery and it doesn't mean we have to go back to alltime highs, but you're starting to see some of the more quality names get back to the juice they were having before. And if they can follow up with good earnings, you know, maybe that's what really can keep this this rally going on.</p>
