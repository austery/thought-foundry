### 引言：政治生涯的回顾

<p class="english-text">Do Ontario's former premers still stand by the policies they became known for? The Premier Files explores all of that and much more.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我，道尔顿·麦金蒂，宣誓我将忠实、勤勉地，并尽我所能和所知，执行作为安大略省省长、执行委员会主席以及省际关系部长的权力和信托。愿上帝助我。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I, Dalton McGinty, swear that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my skill and knowledge, execute the powers and trusts proposed in me as Premier and President of the Executive Council and Minister of Intergovernmental Relations of the Province of Ontario. So help me God.</p>
</details>

### 重返政坛旧地

主持人: 道尔顿·麦金蒂在2003年带领**自由党**（Liberal Party: 加拿大主要政党之一，通常持中左翼立场）重掌政权，成为安大略省第24任省长。他连续赢得了三届选举，使他成为一个多世纪以来最成功的自由党省长。他的执政方式是：不骄不躁，始终如一，只是坚持不懈。我们在这里的**女王公园**（Queens Park: 安大略省议会大楼所在地）与他进行了交谈。麦金蒂省长，我很好奇，在这么多年之后，今天再次走进这座大楼，感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Daltton McGinty brought the Liberals back to power in 2003, becoming Ontario's 24th premier. He won three straight elections, making him the most successful liberal premier in more than a century. His approach, never too high, never too low, just relentless. We spoke here at Queens Park. Premier McGinty, I'm curious as to what it was like walking back into this building today after so many years?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，我遇到了一些能干、友善、乐于助人的安保人员，他们把我当成了普通路人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I was met by um capable, friendly, accommodating security personnel who wouldn't know me from any other passer by.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您真的认为他们不认识您吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You really think they didn't know you?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 他们不认识我。不，不。但时间在流逝，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did not know me. No. No. But time marches on, right? And</p>
</details>

主持人: 您卸任省长已经12年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's been 12 years since you were premier.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 12年了。但是，我对这座大楼充满了美好的回忆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">12 years. And uh but I have all kinds of warm memories uh from this building.</p>
</details>

### 大家庭的成长岁月

主持人: 好的，让我们回到过去，我们最终会谈到这座大楼，但我确实想从头开始。我想从您长大的家庭开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's go back because we're going to go we'll eventually get to this building, but I do want to start at the beginning. And I want to start with the home you grew up in.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 父母和十个孩子。那是不是像听起来那么混乱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With two parents and 10 kids. Was that the mayhem? It sounds like</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我认为那是一种有组织的混乱。我的父母，我想，他们提供了一个舒适的环境，让我们能够像孩子一样疯狂。但也有一些我们必须遵守的规则。你知道，我父亲的一个习惯——如果你想知道的话——他是一位大学教授。靠学术薪水养活十个孩子很难。所以他非常有创业精神，做了各种各样的事情。但他做的一件事是教暑期课程和夜校。所以他会在晚饭时回家和我们在一起，然后晚饭后他会立刻躺在**懒人椅**（Lazy-Boy Chair: 一种带可调节靠背和脚凳的舒适躺椅）上，用报纸盖住自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it was kind of organized mayhem. Uh there was there was my my parents I think it allowed for a comfortable accommodation so that we could be kids and crazy. Uh but there were also some some rules uh that we had to um to to stick by. You know, one of one of my dad's routines uh if you want to he was a university professor. It's hard to feed 10 kids on an academic salary. So he was very entrepreneurial and he did all kinds of things. But one of the things he did is he taught summer courses and he taught evening school. So he'd come home to be with us during dinner and then he'd stretch out immediately after dinner on a lazy boy chair and just cover himself with the newspaper.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我们会像吃了冰淇淋的傻瓜一样跑来跑去，那些冰淇淋是按两加仑桶买的。如果我们太吵，他就会发出一声嚎叫或尖叫，把我们吓得魂飞魄散。我们知道我们必须收敛一下我们的玩乐。所以我们有很多乐趣，但也有很多纪律和很多期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We would run around like idiots high on ice cream that we bought by the two gallon barrels and uh and if we got too loud uh he'd let out a a howl or a shriek that would scare the you know what out of us. and we knew we had to kind of temper our our our fun. So there were there we had a lot of fun, but there was also a lot of discipline and a lot of um expectation.</p>
</details>

### 从家庭到政坛：领导力的早期磨练

主持人: 那么，作为年龄较大的孩子之一，您是否被期望成为弟妹们的“共同父母”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Were you expected though as one of the older kids to be a kind of a co-parent to the younger ones?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的，有一种沉重的期望。不过，史蒂夫，当时我并没有觉得那很沉重。那只是我成长的方式，是我所知道的。我是六个男孩中最大的一个，所以我的父母期望我树立一个好榜样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there was a um a heavy expectation. It's not something that I felt at the time though, Steve, that was heavy. It was just how I was growing up. It was what I knew. I was the oldest of uh six boys and uh um so my job was to my mother and father expected me to set a good example.</p>
</details>

主持人: 这里有很多多任务处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of multitasking here.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 很多多任务处理。是的。当然，在这种大家庭环境中你学到的另一件事是如何管理不同个性的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of multitasking. Yeah. And the other thing of course you learn in this large uh big family environment is um how to manage different personalities.</p>
</details>

主持人: 当您拥有一个由70多名成员组成的**核心小组**（Caucus: 议会中同一政党的议员群体）时，这会有帮助吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does that come in helpful when you've got a caucus of absolutely 70 plus people?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 绝对有帮助。绝对有。我喜欢说核心小组就像一支完全由四分卫组成的橄榄球队。他们都想指挥比赛，他们都以自己的方式成为领导者。他们是领导者，并且在各自的社区中也被视为领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely it does. Absolutely. I like to say a caucus is a football team consisting entirely of quarterbacks. Um they all want to call the play and they are all leaders in their own right. They are leaders and have been seen as such in their communities.</p>
</details>

### 投身公共服务的内在驱动

主持人: 所以，我知道我们可能会找时间回到这些事情上。但我从领导力中学到的一件事是，它有一个简单的公式：找到最优秀的人，发挥他们最大的潜力。这并没有复杂多少。省级政治很大程度上关乎医疗保健和教育。您的母亲是一名护士，您的父亲在高等教育领域工作。我的意思是，原因就在那里。我是否可以假设您投身公共生活很大程度上是因为他们树立的榜样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I'm sure we might find some time to come back to these kinds of things. But one of the things I've learned about leadership is it's there's kind of a simple formula. Get the best people. Get the best out of them. Not much more complicated than that. Provincial politics is so much about healthcare and education. And your mom was a nurse. your dad was in the post-secary world. I mean, there it is right there. Do I assume that a large part of the reason why you went into public life is because of the example they set?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，你知道，我从未真正那样想过，事实上，从未。但是我认为有一种期望，主要是不成文的。仅仅长大、找份工作、纳税是远远不够的。每个人都这样做。那只是一种最低限度的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, not, you know, I've never really thought of it that way, in fact, ever. Um, but I think there was just an expectation, um, mostly unwritten. It's never going to be good enough to grow up, get a job, and pay taxes. Everybody does that. That's kind of the minimum expectation.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 他们也会传达，我们所享受的生活质量非同寻常，这不是凭空而来的。而是前几代人做了一些事情，我将使用一个我们今天很少使用的词：他们为了年轻一代而牺牲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They would also would have conveyed that the quality of life that we enjoyed is nothing short of extraordinary and it didn't just happen. But um previous generations did something and I'm going to use a word we rarely use today. They sacrificed right for the younger generations.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，而且，我们得到了许多美好的东西，比如优秀的学校、优质的医疗保健、安全强大的社区以及安全清洁的环境，这些都是唾手可得的。所有这些美好的事物并非凭空出现。因此，我们每个人都有责任以自己的方式做出贡献。您是什么时候第一次萌生了在人生某个阶段考虑从政的念头？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and uh handed handed down to us on a silver platter. Um wonderful things like great schools and great health care and safe and strong communities and a safe and clean environment. All those kinds of things didn't just happen. Um so there was an expectation we would find a way each in our own way to make a contribution. When did you first get the notion that maybe going into politics at some point in your life was a consideration?</p>
</details>

### 父亲的离世与政治召唤

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，我有点，嗯，先是接近它，然后又远离它，然后又回到了它。所以，我们年轻的时候，我一开始就接触了政治。你知道，我父亲是**约翰·特纳**（John Turner: 加拿大前总理）的写作协会主席，我们甚至在那之前就参与了竞选活动。我们会带着五六个孩子的小团队出现。我们会塞信封，嗯，长大一点后会打一些电话，挨家挨户敲门，觉得竞选活动很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I kind of um um approached it, then pulled away from it, and then came back to it. So, I approached it at the outset uh when we were younger. You know, my dad was John Turner's writing association president, and we worked on campaigns even be before then. We'd show up with a modest crew of five or six kids. Uh we would stuff envelopes, um make some calls when we got a little bit older, knock on doors and came to see campaigning as as a lot of fun.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，然后，嗯，后来我父亲也从政了。嗯，我能看到他觉得这很有挑战性。他想进入内阁。他从未进入内阁。嗯，我能看到长时间的工作，以及离开家人的时间。你被要求调和那些不可调和的矛盾。有时很难取得进展。有挫折，也有玩世不恭。有时这可能是一个有毒的环境。所以那让我对它产生了排斥。然后他去世了。然后我想，你知道，是时候挺身而出了。我想回到您生命中最糟糕的夜晚之一，1990年3月16日。您的父亲正在车道上铲雪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then um um later on my dad got into politics. Um he I could see that he found it very challenging. He wanted to be in cabinet. He never got into cabinet. Uh I could see the the long hours, the time away from family. You're called upon to reconcile the irreconcilable. It's so difficult at times to make progress. There are frustrations and there's cynicism. It can be a toxic environment at time. So that kind of repelled me from it. And then he passed away. And then I thought, you know, hey, time to step up. I want to go back to one of the worst nights of your life, the 16th of March, 1990. and your father is shoveling the snow on the driveway.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您对那个晚上有什么记忆？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you remember about that evening?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我接到了我母亲的电话，我妈妈是一个非常冷静沉着的人。所以她说：“米奇，你最好过来一趟。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I got a call from my mother and my mom's a very uh calm and collected uh was a cal and collected uh person. So, she said, "Mickey, you better get over here."</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以我想，“好吧，没问题。我会花点时间，你知道，把一些事情整理好，确保孩子们都好等等。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I thought, "Okay, all right. I'll take some time and uh you know pull some things together, make sure the kids are good and all that.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 然后三分钟后，我弟弟迈克尔打电话来说：“杰米，快点过来！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then 3 minutes later, my brother Michael phones and he says, "Jamie, get the hell over here."</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以我知道出事了。我上了车。我父母家只有五六分钟的路程。我尽可能快地开车过去。我到那里时，发现我妈妈正在给我爸爸做人工呼吸。所以，嗯……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I knew something was up. So I u get in the car. My mom and dad's place was only like five or six minutes away. Drove as quickly as I could. I get there and found my mom giving my dad uh melt mouth resuscitation. So, um</p>
</details>

主持人: 在户外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">outdoors.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 在户外。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Outdoors. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 冬天在地上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the ground in the winter.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 在地上。是的。是的。所以，嗯，我接手了，她继续，她是一名护士，给他做胸外按压，但是太晚了。嗯，太晚了。所以我们等救护车来。他们把他送到了医院。我们紧随其后，但是，嗯，太晚了。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the ground. Yeah. Yeah. So, um I took over uh and she proceeded, she was a nurse to give him chest compressions and um but it was too late. Uh it was too late. So, we waited for the u uh ambulance to come. and they took him to the hospital. We followed immediately behind and uh but it was it was uh it was too late. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 63岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">63</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 63岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">63 years of age.</p>
</details>

### 名字背后的故事

主持人: 让我回到您刚才说的一件事，就是您母亲叫您麦克。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me circle back to something you said a moment ago, which is your mother called you Mac.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 米克。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mick.</p>
</details>

主持人: 米克。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mick.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您有个兄弟叫您杰米。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you had a brother call you Jamie.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您的名字是小道尔顿·詹姆斯·帕特里克·麦金蒂。您和您父亲同名。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your name's Daltton James Patrick McGinty Jr. You're the same name as your dad.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 大家叫您的名字怎么这么多？嗯，这有点复杂。首先，嗯，是的，嗯，我从小就被称为杰米，我的家人现在仍然叫我杰米。道尔顿是我父亲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's with all the different names that everybody calls you? So well this is a bit complicated. Uh first of all um yeah so um um I was known as Jamie uh growing up and my family still calls me Jamie. Dalton was my father.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 然后后来我的父母，嗯，给我起了个绰号叫米克。那成了我的昵称。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then later on my parents um christristened me uh Mick. That became my nickname.</p>
</details>

### 初入政坛：逆流而上的胜利

主持人: 明白了。除了对您的家庭来说是一场个人悲剧之外，他的去世，我的意思是，现实是，他当时是一名民选议员，他的去世意味着将举行一次**补选**（Bi-election: 因某个席位空缺而举行的选举）来接替他在立法机关的席位，对吗？您的家人花了多长时间才坐下来开始考虑是否有一个孩子会接替他参选？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Gotcha. His death besides being a personal tragedy for your family. I mean, I guess the reality is he's an elected member at the time and his death means there's going to be a bi-election to replace him in the legislature, right? How long did it take before your family kind of sat down and started to think about whether one of the kids would run in hisstead?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，**大卫·彼得森**（David Peterson: 安大略省前省长）在我父亲的葬礼上致了悼词，然后我们在我妈妈家举行了一次聚会。我记得大卫对我和我的兄弟们说：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, David um Peterson delivered the eulogy at my dad's funeral and then we hosted uh a gathering at my mom's house afterwargs. And I remember David saying to me and my brothers,</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: “你们谁要去竞选？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Which one of you is going to run?"</p>
</details>

主持人: 他就是那样说的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He put it like that.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以当时就有一种期望，会是家族中的某个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the expectation was it was going to be somebody from the family.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。当时确实有这种期望。我想即使他没有那样说，我们大家也都会认真考虑。我当时感到一种渴望，想要现在就投入其中。我以前开的玩笑是：“好吧，你看，我的名字已经印在牌子上了，所以我们有一个支持我参选的财务理由。”总之，葬礼两周后，我对**特里**（Terry: Dalton McGuinty的妻子）说：“我想我，嗯，我想我必须参选。”她说：“我们有四个八岁以下的孩子。你不能参选。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. There was kind of an expectation there. And I think even had he not said that, I think we'd all seriously considered it. And I I felt a yearning something to get to get at this now. And um and the joke I used to make was, "Well, look, my name's already on the signs, so we've got a a financial argument in favor of my candidacy." Anyway, two weeks after the funeral, I said to Terry, "I think I uh I think I got to run." She says, "We have four kids under eight. You're not running."</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我说：“这太明智了。”嗯，但对我来说，就像我所有在政治上追求的事情一样，史蒂夫，它总是更多地关乎内心而非头脑。有人说，心有其理，理性本身永远无法知晓。我感到了一种召唤。我感到有责任接替我父亲未竟的事业。这就是事情的始末。我是如何进入政坛的。1990年大选来临，您是女王公园唯一的新自由党人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said, "That is so sensible." Um, but for me, as for everything that I have ever pursued in politics, it was always much more, Steve, an affair of the heart than the head. It's been said that the heart has its reasons. Reason alone will never know. And I felt a calling. I felt a responsibility to pick up where my dad had left off. And that's the long and the short of it. How I got in. The 1990 election comes and you are the one liberal who's new at Queens Park.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我是1990届的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am the class of 1990.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您是1990届的自由党人。在那次选举中，59名自由党**省议员**（MPP: Member of Provincial Parliament，省议会成员）失去了席位。那是**鲍勃·雷**（Bob Ray: 安大略省前省长，新民主党领袖）以令人震惊的冷门获胜的选举。您认为您是如何抵挡住那股席卷全省，让自由党人纷纷落败的浪潮的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You are the liberal class of 1990. 59 Liberal MPPPs lost their seats in that election. This was the election Bob Ray won in a shocking upset. How do you think you managed to withstand the tide that was slaying liberals all over the province?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，纯粹是因为我参选的素质。但说真的，各位，嗯，我认为我父亲享有极好的声誉。我认为这毫无疑问。我认为当时，嗯，有一种“给这个孩子一个机会”的想法，对吧？他父亲在任。嗯，他是一位正直的社区生活贡献者。让我们给这个孩子一个机会。所以我认为毫无疑问存在一些同情。嗯，我喜欢想的另一件事是，我们进行了一场出色的竞选，嗯，我们进行了一场诚实的竞选。你知道，我做的一件事，我想我甚至把它写进了我的书里，你知道，就像我挨家挨户敲门三天后，我发现**布鲁姆**（Bloom: 可能是指当时自由党领袖David Peterson，因其在1990年选举中的表现不佳）真的从自由党的名单上消失了。所以我回到竞选总部。我说：“我们必须撤掉所有我领导人的海报。必须把它们从我的宣传册中拿掉。”你知道，有些人可能会认为这是异端邪说。但我认为我对我的领导人最重要的义务是赢得我的席位。赢得我的席位。所以，嗯，我就是这样做的，我非常努力，并且成功赢得了选举。我知道我们党遭受了重创，我记得我们在这座大楼里的第一次会议，史蒂夫。我是唯一一位新当选的省议员，当时所有参加那次选举并失败的省议员都聚集在一起。所以我感觉自己像坐在守灵会上。我想，“搞什么鬼？我刚赢了这场选举。我正乘风破浪呢。”我很高兴能来到这里，并感谢这个机会，但当然我不得不，你知道，咬紧牙关，感受我的同事们正在经历的现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the sheer quality of my candidacy. But seriously, folks, um I think that um my dad had an excellent reputation. I think there's no doubt about that. I think that there was um um some let's give this kid a shot, right? His dad was in office. Um he was an upstanding contributor to our community life. Let's give the kid a shot. So I think there's there's undoubtly some sympathy there associated with that. Um and the other thing I like to think was we we ran a good campaign and um uh we ran an honest campaign. I you know one of the things I did I think I even put this in my book you know like three days after I've been knocking on doors I had discovered that Bloom had really come off the liberal roles. So came back to campaign headquarters. I said, "We have to remove all posters of my leader. Have to take them out of my pamphlets." You know, some people might consider this heretical. But I figured the single most important um obligation I owed to my leader was win my seat. Win my seat. So um that's what I did and worked very hard and was able to uh win. And I know that our party took a kicking and I recall our first meeting in this building, Steve. I was the only newly elected MPP and at the time it was a gathering of all the the u the MPPPs who had run in that election and lost and lost. So I felt like I was sitting in on a wake. I thought, "What the hell? I just won this thing. This is I'm I'm I'm riding a wave here." I was excited to be here and u grateful uh for the opportunity but of course I had to you know bite my tongue and feel the the reality of what was being experienced by my colleagues.</p>

### 初露锋芒：领导党派的抱负

主持人: 您肯定不记得了，但我从未忘记。您赢得席位后不久，我和您共进午餐，因为我想我必须见见这位新当选的自由党省议员，了解他的一切。所以，我们在大楼的地下室共进午餐，在午餐过程中，当我问您，您对这里有什么计划时，您不知怎么地提到了：“嗯，我想有一天能领导这个党。”您说这话的时候，可能还不知道这座大楼的洗手间在哪里。您真的，是什么给了您勇气，让您开始思考，鉴于您的党刚刚经历了一场血洗，而您是一个全新的面孔，您竟然可以成为这个党的领袖？

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's no way you will remember this but I have never forgotten it. you and I had a lunch not too long after you won your seat because I thought I got to meet this one new Liberal MPP and find out what he's all about. So, we had lunch in the basement of this building and somehow during the course of that lunch, you mentioned to me when I asked you, you know, what are your plans for around here? You said, "Well, I think I'd like to lead this party someday." You said that having probably no idea where the bathrooms in this building even were yet. Did you really what what gave you the hutzbah to start thinking you could be the leader of this party given the blood bath your party just been through and you're a brand new person here?</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。嗯，当时我可能只是充满了**勇气**（Blie: 可能为“bravado”或“chutzpah”的口语化表达，指大胆、自信）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um I was probably just full of blie uh at the time.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我喜欢您没有否认这个故事。所以可能只是充满了勇气。嗯，但我认为我直到很久以后才真正认真考虑过。嗯，但我当时想，你知道，也许我能带来一些与众不同的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I love that you're not denying the story. So probably just full of blie. Um, but I think that I didn't give it really serious consideration until um, much later.

### 竞选党魁：重振旗鼓的决心

主持人: 您和我午餐时谈话的疯狂之处在于，六年之后，您竞选党魁并获胜了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The crazy thing about the conversation you and I had over lunch is that six years later, you ran for the leadership and won.</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

主持人: 是什么让您在1996年，41岁的时候，认为您真的已经准备好成为党的领袖了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What made you think at the age of 41 years old in 1996 that you were ready actually to be the leader of the party?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 对。嗯，我觉得我们需要重振这个党，对吧？它当时**萎靡不振**（Languishing: 长期处于衰弱或停滞状态），嗯，我们大概50年才赢了一次。嗯，我想我能带来一些新的方式、新的想法、新的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Well, I felt we needed to kickstart a party, right? It was um languishing and uh we had won one in 50 years, I guess it was. Um and I thought I could bring forward some um some new ways, some new ideas, some new um methods.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，我想，管他呢，试试看吧。嗯，我，你知道，当时并没有什么全省范围内的“推举道尔顿”运动，我可以向您保证。嗯，而且，当您告诉妻子您想竞选党魁时，家里又是一场挣扎。

<details>

### 出人意料的党魁选举胜利

主持人: 我们坐在这里，在2025年6月，距离您参加那次领导人大会已经快30年了，您在**枫叶花园**（Maple Leaf Gardens: 多伦多一个历史悠久的体育场馆，曾举办过许多重大活动）召集了所有支持者，第一轮投票结果出来后，您排在第四位。

主持人: 那时您觉得自己的机会如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did you think of your chances at that point?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我想，你知道吗，我并没有因此而气馁，因为我的目标是成为每个人最喜欢的第二选择。我知道，在这场选举中，我们当时是六个人还是七个人，我不记得了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought I thought you know what I wasn't I wasn't put out by that because um my ambition was to be everybody's favorite second choice. I knew that in this I think were there six of us or seven of us I can't recall</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，相当多的领导人候选人，总共有七个。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh a fair number of of leadership candidates seven all told. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，嗯，我曾努力做到，那是一场老式的**代表大会**（Delegated Convention: 政党通过选举代表来投票选出领导人或提名候选人的会议），最好的那种。您说对了。所以您会认识这些代表。所以我特意在大会前亲自给每一位代表打电话。

<p class="english-text">So um I had made an effort to it was a it was an old-fashioned delegated convention. the best the best kind. You got that right. And so you get to know who the delegates are. So I made a point of phoning every single one before that convention personally.</p>
</details>

主持人: 5000名代表。全部打电话。电话的目的只是为了说，我知道您支持某某。太棒了。某某是一位优秀的候选人。但是，如果他或她退出投票，我很荣幸能得到您的支持。就是这样一种温和的推销，对吧？所以，嗯，我的目标是成为每个人最喜欢的第二选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">5,000 delegates. Phone them all. And the purpose of the call was simply to say, I see you're supporting so and so. Fabulous. So and so's an an excellent candidate. However, should he or she drop off the ballot, I'd be honored to have your support. Just a soft cell like that, right? So, um that was my objective to be everybody's favorite um uh second choice.</p>
</details>

主持人: 然而，当第二轮投票结果出来时，您仍然排在第四位，而且是更糟糕的第四位。那么，那时您是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Except when the results of the second ballot came in, you were still in fourth and a worse fourth. So, what did you think at that point?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

主持人: 传统观点认为，当您在第二轮投票中排名更差的第四位时，您就应该退出并去支持另一位候选人，对吗？您考虑过那样做吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The conventional wisdom says when you come a worse fourth on the second ballot, you drop out and you go Yeah. you go endorse another candidate, right? Did you consider that?</p>

<p class="english-text">No. No. I think there were still people behind me at that time.</p>

<p class="english-text">Well, that was the crazy thing. The people behind you who dropped off didn't go to one of the top three candidates. They went to you.</p>

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

主持人: 折衷的候选人，对吧？我没问题。您必须完成工作。对。所以，嗯，事情就是这样发展的。这是一次非凡的大会，因为它不仅始于一天，结束于另一天。它始于一个月，结束于另一个月。对。那是11月30日到12月1日。

<p class="english-text">Did you talk to Joe personally in between the fourth and fifth ballots in order to try to secure his delegates?</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，我真的是孤身一人。总之，当乔过来的时候，我很高兴，嗯，然后我记得，史蒂夫，他们，嗯，大会的组织者做了什么，他们，嗯，他们派了一些人悄悄地告诉我们结果是什么。所以最后投票的是我和**乔里·肯尼迪**（Jory Kennedy: 可能是指另一位政治人物）。是的。所以我转向特里说：“亲爱的，我们赢了。”

<p class="english-text">You then become the leader of the official opposition at Queens Park.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。让我给您讲一个故事。当然，我花了一段时间才适应这个职位。所以，嗯，我不得不在凌晨4点30分，当没有人想听任何事情的时候，走到讲台，离开我的座位，不管怎样，走下去，嗯，走到舞台上，嗯，到处都是人，你知道，还有很多媒体等等。在某个时候，有人说，嗯，退后，给领袖让路。所以我退后了，当时还没有习惯自己是领袖这个概念。所以我走上前去，发表了一些简短的讲话，然后，嗯，我想，很疯狂的是，第二天早上有早餐会，我必须在早餐会上发表演讲，然后，嗯，派对就结束了，所有人都回家了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Let me just tell you one story. So sure, it took me a while to kind of grow into the job. So, um, I had to at 4:30 in the morning when nobody wanted to hear anything, go to the make my way to the podium, get leave my, uh, set of seats, whatever, up uh, and and walk down and, uh, make my way to the, uh, to the stage and, uh, there's people everywhere, you know, and lots of media and all that stuff. And at some point, somebody says, um, stand back and make room for the leader. So I stood back yet to grow accustomed to the notion that somehow I was a leader. So I went up there, gave some modest remarks and then uh I think crazily there was a a breakfast the next morning and I had to give a speech at breakfast and then uh then the party was over and everybody went home</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 特里和孩子们上了飞机回家了。然后我记得我精疲力尽地独自走在央街上，心想：“我到底把自己卷入了什么？”我感受到的不是职位的重压，而是期望的重压。我如何才能不辜负我党的期望？我如何才能把他们团结起来？我如何才能组建一个像样的反对党？我如何才能激发安大略省人民的信心？我如何才能在这一切中让我的家人紧密团结并安全？所以，那就是我当时真实的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Terry and the kids got on a plane and went back home. And then I recall I was exhausted walking up Young Street on my own thinking, "What the hell have I gotten myself into?" And I was feeling the weight of not of office, of expectation. How am I going to live up to my party's expectations? How am I going to pull them together? How am I going to form a a decent opposition? How am I going to inspire the confidence of Ontarians? How am I going to um keep my family tight and safe throughout all of this? So, that's that's what I was feeling honestly at at that time.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那可真不少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a lot.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>

</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 一天一天地过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Day at a time.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 就一天一天地过。嗯，我记得我第一次走进这座大楼时，我有一个办公室，上面有一个安全按钮，嗯，我按了一下。什么也没发生。我心想，欢迎来到反对党领袖的无力感。但我只是，只是，一天一天地过。就一天一天地过。你知道，我的个人座右铭一直是：不骄不躁，始终如一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just a day at a time. And uh I recall I recall when I first got into this building and I had um I got an office, it had a um a security button on it and um I pressed it. Nothing happened. And I thought to myself, welcome to the powerlessness of leader of the opposition. And but I just took it just took it one day at a time. Just take it one day at a time. And you know, my personal mantra has always been never too high, never too low, just relentless.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 您必须，嗯，会有更聪明的人。会有，嗯，嗯，在不同方面能力更强的人。但我总是告诉自己，没有人会比我更努力。我将继续做我需要做的事情，以成长、学习、理解，并变得更强大、更有能力满足安大略省人民的需求。他们说，担任反对党领袖是公共生活中最糟糕的工作。确实如此。

But I always told myself, nobody will outwork me. I will keep doing what I need to do to grow and to learn, to understand, and to become stronger and more capable of meeting the needs of Ontarians. They say being the leader of the opposition is the worst job in public life. It is.</p>
</details>

### 与对手的交锋：政治哲学与个人修养

主持人: 嗯，另一方面，**迈克·哈里斯**（Mike Harris: 安大略省前省长，进步保守党领袖）当时是省长。所以您有一个对手，他在安大略省的政治史上是一个极具争议的人物。这是否让您的工作更有活力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, on the other hand, Mike Harris was the premier. So, you had a guy to oppose who was an incredibly polarizing figure in Ontario political history. Did that make the job more invigorating for you?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，在某些方面，他是一个强大的对手，对吧？在**鲍勃·雷**时代之后，他，嗯，触及了安大略省的一个脉搏，人们，嗯，当然一开始更倾向于认为最好的政府是最小的政府。也许如果您只是让我们保留更多的税款，并让我们自己谋生，嗯，那就是我们现在正在寻找的。我有一种不同的哲学、意识形态，嗯，而且，嗯，基于我们齐心协力时才能做到最好的理念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, in some ways he was a formidable folk, right? He had um tapped into um a vein in Ontario post um the Bob Ray years and people were um certainly at the outset were more of the view that maybe the best government is the least government. Maybe if you just allow us to keep more of our tax money and make our own way in life um that's what we're looking for right now. I had a different philosophy, ideology, um, and, um, based on the notion that we're at our best when we do things together.</p>
</details>

主持人: 在一次特别艰难的质询期间，他对您说了一些话。我必须说，我想您的父亲会为看到您日复一日地站在泥沼中，毁掉您父亲和您的声誉而感到羞愧。您是如何接受的？不太好。您之后和他谈过这件事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He said something to you during one particularly tough exchange during question period. I have to say this. I think your father would be embarrassed to see you stand here day after day after day in the gutter ruining ruining the reputation of your father and your How did you take that? Not well. Did you ever talk to him about it afterwards?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 不，我从未谈过。我只是让它过去了。**尤利乌斯·凯撒**（Julius Caesar: 古罗马军事统帅和政治家）在2000年前曾说过：“没有人能同时成功地咨询他们的理性和激情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I never did. I just let it I let it pass by. Julius Caesar 2,000 years ago once said, "Nobody has ever successfully consulted their reason and their passion at the same time."</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 或者就像我母亲会说的：“你不能又聪明又生气，米克。你想成为哪一个？”好的。所以，嗯，我努力做到聪明，对吧？并努力不被这些个人争斗所诱惑。这并不总是成功的，嗯，而且随着时间的推移，我可能甚至自己也发起了一些，嗯，我后来会后悔的。我认为当我们屈尊做那种事情时，我们就不再是最好的自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or as my mother would say, "You can't be smart and angry, Mick. Which one do you want to be?" Okay. So, um I tried to be smart, right? And tried not to get uh lured into these um personal combats. It wasn't always successful uh and probably over time I may have even launched a few of my own uh which I would have subsequently regretted. I think we are at less than our best when we stoop to those kinds of things.</p>
</details>

### 1999年大选：失败中的成长与信念

主持人: 您作为领袖的第一次选举是1999年，我想起来，那很像我们国家刚刚举行的上次联邦选举。您获得了40%的选票，这在大多数情况下足以赢得多数政府。他们针对您投放广告，说您不胜任这份工作。是的。他们说对了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your first election as leader is 1999 and as I think about it it was a lot like the last federal election we just had in this country. You got 40% of the vote which on most days of the week is enough to win a majority government. They ran ads against you saying he's not up to the job. Yep. Were they right?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，我当然为我作为领袖的第二次省级选举做好了更充分的准备。我当时，嗯，边学边做。有些日子我觉得自己只是勉强支撑。嗯，但是，嗯，你知道，在辩论之后，我感觉我度过了难关，我觉得我表现得不是特别好，但史蒂夫，我感到一种奇怪的解脱。我想我现在没有什么可失去的了。然后我从那次失败中学到的最大教训是，在选举中，就像在公共生活中一样，信念很重要。不要再试图告诉人们您认为他们想听什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I was certainly much better prepared for my second provincial election as leader. I was um learning on the fly. Some days I felt like I was just hanging on. Uh but uh you know where I kind of felt I turned the corner after the debate which I felt I did not do particularly well in but I felt Steve oddly liberated. I thought I have nothing to lose now. And then my big learning from that loss was that in an election, as in public life generally, conviction counts. Stop trying to tell people what you think they want to hear.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 作为一名领导者，告诉他们您认为他们需要听什么。他们可能喜欢，也可能不喜欢。重要的是您对他们诚实。我喜欢说，您必须关心人们对您的看法，但您更要关心您对自己的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Act as a leader and tell them what you think they need to hear. They may like it and they may not like it. What's important is that you are honest with them.

### 2003年大选：走向省长之位

主持人: 嗯，2002年，他辞职了。**厄尼·埃夫斯**（Ernie Eves: 安大略省前省长，进步保守党领袖）接任，并宣布在2003年10月2日举行选举。此时您已经担任省议员13年了。您已经担任党领袖7年了。您对那次竞选感觉如何？

<p class="english-text">Uh 2002, he steps down. Ernie Ees takes over, calls an election for October 2nd, 2003. You have been an MPP at this point for 13 years. You have been the leader of your party for seven. How are you feeling going into that campaign?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 感觉很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Feeling good.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 感觉很好。嗯，不仅是我觉得自己作为竞选者会更强大，史蒂夫，我觉得我已经积累了大量的好主意，而且我花了很多时间，你知道，担任反对党领袖是一项糟糕的工作，正如您所提到的。嗯，但它也让您有时间去思考。我曾去爱尔兰考察**凯尔特之虎**（Celtic Tiger: 指1990年代中期至2000年代末爱尔兰经济快速增长的时期），即爱尔兰经济奇迹般的转变。那到底是怎么回事？他们做了什么以及是如何做到的？然后我去了英国，考察了**托尼·布莱尔**（Tony Blair: 英国前首相）和他们正在做的事情，以及为什么会如此成功。然后我看了看，你知道，互联网终于开始普及了。我还考察了世界各地的其他经验。所以，我觉得我带着一些伟大的计划和对安大略省未来强烈的愿景来到了谈判桌前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Feeling good. uh not only in terms of how I felt I was going to be stronger as a campaigner, Steve, I felt I had um amassed an arsenal of really good ideas and I had spent you know the the the um being leader of the opposition is a terrible job as you mentioned. Uh but it also affords you the luxury of taking time. I had traveled to Ireland to look at the the uh the Celtic tiger, the Irish economic turnaround miracle. What the hell was that all about? What did they do and how'd they do it? And then I went to the UK and looked at u Tony Blair and what they were doing and why that was working so well. And then I looked at, you know, the internet was finally kicking around. Looked at other other um experiences across the world. So, I felt I was coming to the table with um um some great plans and a and a strong vision for what Ontario could be.</p>
</details>

主持人: 在竞选期间，有一个时刻，**进步保守党**（PC Party: Progressive Conservative Party，加拿大主要政党之一，通常持中右翼立场）发布了一份新闻稿，称您是来自另一个星球的邪恶爬行动物小猫食者。您现在笑了，但您的竞选团队在新闻稿发布后愤怒地回应了。您是如何回应的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a moment in the campaign when the PC party put out a press release calling you an evil reptilian kitten eater from another planet. You're laughing now, but your campaign reacted with fury when that came out. How did you react to it?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我觉得，我觉得那很有趣。我觉得那很有趣。你知道我做了什么吗？我，我，我没有在事发后不久在一个农场里发泄。我在一个谷仓里。

</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 有一只流浪小猫走了过来。我想：“我该不该抱起它？万一它抓伤我的脸怎么办？”对吧？这里有点风险。总之，我抱起了那只小猫。它非常可爱，我给它拍了一张照片，嗯，这张照片在安大略省的安大略人中广为流传。所以，是的，你知道，这些事情发生了。这很愚蠢。我把它看作是，嗯，他们给了我一个机会，对吧？那是一个如此愚蠢的批评。嗯，然后那只小猫出现了。所以，我有点，我能够把它包装一下。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There was a stray kitten making its way across. I thought, "Do I pick this thing up? What if it scratches my face?" Right? There's a bit of risk here.

</details>

主持人: 顺便说一句，您没有吃那只猫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for the record, you did not eat the cat.</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 我没有吃那只猫。我拍了拍它，然后放下了。

<p class="english-text">Just checking. Okay.</p>

<p class="english-text">What do you remember from election night when you won 46% of the total vote, 72 seats, and the first Liberal majority government since 1987?</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, just feeling really good, very proud. I felt very grateful. And but, you know, because it's kind of the McGinty way, this is the way my dad used to react to these kinds of things. I also began thinking immediately now we got to deliver.</p>

### 艰难的税收决策：承诺与现实的权衡

主持人: 您担任省长期间第一个真正艰难的时刻，嗯，是当您意识到，如果您要兑现所有关于医疗保健和教育以及重新投资系统的承诺，您就必须违背不增税的誓言，而您曾对着镜头著名地说道：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first really tough moment in your premiership uh came when you realized that if you were going to keep all the promises you made about healthcare and education and reinvesting in the system, you were going to have to break your pledge not to raise taxes, which you had famously looked into the camera and said,</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: “我告诉安大略省的家庭，在自由党政府执政期间，他们的税收明天或任何一天都不会增加。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I'm telling Ontario families that their taxes will not go up tomorrow or any day under Liberal government."</p>
</details>

主持人: 请告诉我们您和您的团队是如何权衡这些选择的，是违背关于重新投资医疗保健和教育系统的承诺，还是违背不增税的承诺，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">give us some sense about how you and your team weighed those options about whether to break the health and education promises about reinvesting in the system or do I break my promise not to raise taxes, right?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。好的，让我们暂时退一步。所以，嗯，**安大略省纳税人联合会**（Ontario Taxpayers Federation: 一个倡导减税和政府问责的非营利组织），我想是它，嗯，希望我签署一份承诺，而您也签了。我在电视上大张旗鼓地签了一份大承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay, let's just back off for a moment. So, the uh Ontario Taxpayers Federation, I think it was, uh wanted me to sign a pledge, and you did. And I did in a flourish a big it was a big pledge on TV.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 当然，在我这样做之前，我问我的团队，我们是否确定我们有足够的经济能力进行我们想要进行的投资，以恢复我们的公共服务，即医疗保健和教育的健康和活力。他们说：“没问题。我们已经全面掌握了。我们已经请独立经济学家对此进行了研究。一切都很好。”我说：“好的，太棒了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now before I did that, of course, uh I said to my team, are we sure um that we can we're going to have the um economic wherewithal to make the kinds of investments that we want to make to restore health and vitality to our public services, i.e. healthcare and education. They said, "No worries. We're all over this. We've had independent economists take a look at this. It's all good." I said, "Okay, great.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以我上任政府几天后，嗯，高级官员说，省长，我们需要告诉您一些事情。我说，是的，那是什么？嗯，您正面临着近60亿美元的赤字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I get in the government couple days later the uh u senior bureaucrats say premier we need we need to let you in on something. I said yeah what is that? Well you're running close to a $6 billion deficit.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，你知道，我有点震惊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I kind of went into a shock.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我现在可以反驳一下吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I push back on that right now?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 因为您有一位非常聪明的财政评论员，名叫**杰里·菲利普斯**（Jerry Phillips），他过去常常撰写关于该省财政状况的通讯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because you had a very smart finance critic named Jerry Phillips who used to write his own newsletter about the state of the province's finances.</p>
</details>

主持人: 而且在那份通讯中，是的。他预测了55亿到60亿美元的赤字。所以您告诉我您很震惊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in that newsletter Yeah. He forecast a five and a half to6 billion dollar deficit. So you tell me you were in shock.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 他没有。好的。为什么您会震惊？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He wasn't. Okay. Why were you?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，我不记得杰里的预测，但我确实记得独立经济学家告诉我们我们会没事的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't recall Jerry's um uh prediction, but I do recall independent economists telling us we were going to be okay.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，嗯，我学到了，所以我不得不应对这个巨大的挑战，它教会了我一些事情。第一，嗯，如果您必须吞下一只蟾蜍，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, I've learn so I kind of I had to grapple with this, you know, this um um huge challenge and and and it taught me a few things. One is um if you have to swallow a toad,</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 不要盯着它太久。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">don't stare at it for too long.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 好的。你知道，一次性把它做完。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. It's, you know, do it all at once.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您必须，是的。政治中的另一个说法是，如果您知道您会去那里，那就去那里。不要被拖着，踢着喊着。以一种坚定您认为在这种情况下我们需要做的事情的方式去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're going to have to Yeah. If the other expression in politics is if you know you're going to go there, go there. Don't get dragged there kicking and screaming. do what you have to do in a way that is assertive of what you believe we need to do under the circumstances.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以我的选择是，要么违背我投资医疗保健和教育的承诺，要么违背我不增税的承诺。我决定选择增税，我做到了。我们称之为“健康保费”。那是一次增税。嗯，我们，嗯，公平地将所有这些钱用于医疗保健，并且在接下来的四年里，我们对医疗保健和教育进行了大规模投资。现在，我可能也给了我的，嗯，嗯，反对党和媒体一根2x4的木棍，让他们在接下来的四年里可以敲打我的头和肩膀，他们也乐此不疲地这样做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So my choices were to um reneg on my promise to invest in healthcare and education or reneg on my promise not to raise taxes. I decided to go with uh raising taxes which I did. We called it a uh health premium. It was a tax hike. Um, and we uh dedicate all that money to health care in fairness and we made um massive investments in healthcare and education over the next four years. Now, I might as well have given my um um opposition and the media a 2x4 so that they could hit me about the head and shoulders for the next four years, which they happily did.</p>
</details>

主持人: 他们做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They did.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 然后我再次获得了多数席位。如果您做某事是出于正确的理由，并且您真诚地相信它是正确的理由，对吧，而且它并不容易，也不方便，甚至可能不受欢迎。如果您花时间解释清楚，而我们在接下来的三四年里也这样做了，那么您就会发现人们比您想象的更理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I got another majority. If you're doing something for the right reason that you honestly believe is the right reason, right, and it's not easy and it's not convenient and it may not even be popular. If you take the time to explain that, and we did that over the ensuing uh, you know, three or four years, then you will um discover that people are more understanding than you might otherwise have thought.</p>
</details>

### 2007年大选：对手失误与信念的力量

主持人: 只是为了好玩，我要稍微反驳一下，因为我记得2007年6月9日，您和您未来的对手，当时领导进步保守党的**约翰·托利**（John Tory: 加拿大政治家，曾任多伦多市长），在民意调查中不分上下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just for fun, I'm going to push back a little bit on this because I recall June 9th, 2007, you and your future opponent, John Tory, who was leading the PC party at the time, were dead even in the polls.</p>
</details>

主持人: 然后他提出了**信仰资助**（Faith-based funding: 政府向宗教学校或其他信仰机构提供资金）的承诺，向所有信仰，而不仅仅是天主教信仰，提供公共资金用于其教育系统，对吗？然后民意调查就变成了那样，您就领先了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he came out with the faith-based funding promise to give public money to all faiths, not just the Catholic faith, for their education systems, right? And that's when the polls went like that and you pulled ahead.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以，是的，您坚持了自己的信念。您对人们直言不讳。您对您认为需要违背增税承诺的方式很诚实。您也真的很幸运。有人做出了一个不明智的承诺，您很幸运。这样说公平吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yes, you stuck with your conviction. You were blunt with people. You're honest about the way you thought you needed to go back on the tax hike promise. You got really lucky, too. Somebody made an ill-advised promise and you got lucky. Is that fair to say?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。是的。我想，史蒂夫，这确实有一些道理，但我也认为，在安大略省人民眼中，在选民眼中，我并没有因为违背那个承诺而犯下致命的错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. Yeah. I think there's sure there's there's some truth to that. Uh, Steve, but I also think that um I wasn't in the eyes of Ontarians, in the eyes of the electorate, fatally flawed for having broken that uh promiser.</p>
</details>

### 创建绿带：为子孙后代留下的遗产

主持人: 您的政府创建了**绿带**（Greenbelt: 旨在保护自然区域免受城市扩张影响的土地规划政策）。所以，我想问几个关于这个问题的问题。这是一片从多伦多以北的**奥克里奇冰碛**（Oak Ridges Moraine: 安大略省南部的一个重要地理特征，也是重要的生态区域）一直延伸到尼亚加拉大瀑布的土地，环绕着**金马蹄地区**（Golden Horseshoe: 安大略省南部的一个高人口密度和工业化的地区）。那是一个历史性的决定。为什么要做这件事，明知您会因此与许多开发商和潜在购房者惹上大麻烦，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your government created the green belt. So, I want to ask a couple of questions about that. This is the swath of land all the way from the Oakg's marine just north of Toronto around the Golden Horseshoe all the way to Niagara Falls. It was an historic decision of the time. Why do it knowing that you were going to get into a whole heap of trouble with a lot of developers and home potential home buyers, right,</p>
</details>

主持人: 他们想在那片土地上建造和购买房屋，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">who wanted to build and buy homes on that land, right?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 如果您去伦敦、巴黎、马德里和纽约这样的地方，那里没有人抱怨前几代人预留了太多的绿地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you visit places like London and Paris and Madrid and New York, nobody there is complaining that previous generations set aside too much green space.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以我想我感到对子孙后代负有某种责任，我认为我们需要大胆。我们需要为子孙后代雄心勃勃，以便他们在未来的日子里能有一些绿地可以享受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think I felt a certain accountability to generations yet to come and I thought we need to be bold. We need be need to be ambitious uh on behalf of of future generations so that they'll have some green space to enjoy um in days in days to come.</p>
</details>

主持人: 但是当那些经常给您的党捐款的富裕开发商来找您说：“把我的地从绿带里拿出来。我想在那里盖房子。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when the rich developers who often gave money to your party came to you and said, "Get my bloody land out of the green belt. I want to build there."</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您是如何反击的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did you push back on that?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我明白。不，我理解。而且，你知道，总会有紧迫的即时财务需求，而领导者的责任就是权衡这些需求与其他责任和问责制。所以我们建立了这个。它是世界上最大的城市绿带。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I get it. No, I understand it. and and you know there are are um there are always going to be pressing immediate financial imperatives and the responsibility of leadership is to weigh those against um other responsibilities and other accountabilities. So we set this up. It's the biggest urban greens green belt um in the world.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 他们最初来找我，说：“这里有一个60万英亩的提案。”我说：“我们现在来看看这个，然后咨询一些人，看看我们如何能把它做得更大。”我们把它扩大到了180万英亩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They came to me originally and said, "Here's a proposal for 600,000 acres." And I said, "Let's take a look at this now and let's let's consult some people and see how we might make it bigger." And we we we got it to 1.8 million acres.</p>
</details>

### 信仰资助争议与教育理念

主持人: 好的。让我回到2007年的选举。现在，我们谈到了约翰·托利和信仰资助的承诺。当那个承诺出来时，正如我所说，当那个承诺出来时，你们两个在民意调查中不分上下，然后你知道，对他来说，事情就变得一团糟了。似乎唯一有影响的问题是信仰资助，最终约翰·托利退缩了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Let me circle back to the 2007 election. Now, we talked about John Tori and the faith-based funding promise. When that promise came out, and as I say, you two were tied in the polls when that promise came out, and then the you know what hit the fan for him. The only issue with any traction, it seemed, was faith-based funding, and eventually John Tory backed off.</p>
</details>

主持人: 他们说这比我想象的更具分裂性。嗯，感情的深度非常强烈，所以我听取了人民的意见。您是否立刻明白这对您来说是一个机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They said it turned out to be more divisive than I thought. Uh, the depth of feelings was very strong and so I listened to the people. Did you immediately understand that that was an opening for you?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 一开始可能没有。我当时的担忧是，当我思考这个问题时，公立教育背后的理论是，我们将所有来自不同背景、不同社会经济状况、不同宗教的孩子聚集在一起，以便他们可以互相学习，共同成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Probably not at the outset. The concern I had was as I thought about it is that the theory behind publicly funded education is that uh we bring all our kids from all backgrounds, all socioeconomic circumstances, all religions together so that they can learn from each other and grow together.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我记得您在那次竞选期间发表演讲，您小时候是在天主教学校系统上学的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember you making speeches during that campaign and you went to a Catholic, you know, school system when you were a kid.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的。我的意思是，当这些话从您口中说出时，您是否意识到自己听起来有点虚伪？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Did you I mean when the words came out of your mouth, did you realize I might be sounding a bit hypocritical here?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，那是我们的宪法现实。嗯，如果我们今天必须从头开始重建安大略省的教育系统，我们会重建一个双轨学校系统吗？我不知道我们是否会。我想我们不会，但那是我们的现实。但我可以说，根据我对今天天主教学校的了解，您会发现各种各样的人现在都进入了我们的天主教学校。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's our constitutional reality. Um would we rebuild a um two school system for our Ontario education um if we had to do it over from scratch today? I I I don't know if we would. I I don't think we would, but it's our reality. But I can say that knowing what I know of the Catholic schools today, you're going to find all kinds of face now going to into our Catholic schools. </p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

### 连任成功与团队力量

主持人: 您在2007年10月10日赢得了第二次连续多数政府。您当时知道自己是70年来第一位连续赢得多数席位的自由党省长吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You won a second consecutive majority government on the 10th of October 2007. Did you know at the time you were the first Liberal premier in 70 years to win back-to-back majorities?</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 不，我没有考虑那些事情。

<details>

Dalton McGuinty: 您可能就是那个告诉我这件事的人，因为您关注这些事情。嗯，我认为这很棒，对吧？我为我的团队感到高兴，嗯，是的，当然，你知道，嗯，我是党的领袖，我是政府的首脑。嗯，但您的能力取决于您的团队。

Dalton McGuinty: 我有一个强大的团队，我努力从我的团队中获得最好的表现。嗯，回顾一下，你知道，早年生活经历之一，你知道，我父亲，身高6英尺4英寸，体重240磅，拥有博士学位，有点，你知道，在餐桌上高高在上。他会给我们讲的一个教训是：“孩子们，我想让你们记住一件事。这里没有人比我们所有人加起来更强大。这里没有人比我们所有人加起来更聪明。所以，我们今天在这里，我们谈论了很多关于我的领导力和我的省长任期，嗯，以及我做了什么，但事实是，我这样说并不是为了，你知道，过分谦虚，我有一个伟大的团队，我站在他们的肩膀上，你知道，如果我曾经想过，例如，嗯，我正在我的办公室里会见外国政要，我有一瞬间认为，我可能是这个房间里目前在这个问题上最优秀的人。我心想，安大略省现在陷入了大麻烦，因为他们只依靠我一个人的大脑。”

And one of one of the lessons he would offer, he says, "Kids, I want you to remember something. Nobody here is as strong as all of us. Nobody here's as smart as all of us. So, we're here today and we're talking a lot about my leadership and my premiership uh and what I did, but the truth of the matter is, and I'm not saying this to be, you know, uh unduly, um modest modest, I had a great team and I stood on their shoulders and you know, if I ever thought, for example, that um I was I was meeting with foreign dignitaries maybe here in my office and I thought for a moment, I may be the best vers on this subject right now in this room. I thought to myself, Ontarians are now in deep trouble because they're relying on this brain alone."</p>

### 2011年大选：少数政府的挑战

主持人: 您的第三次选举，2011年10月6日，在某些方面是最引人入胜的一次，因为您只差一个席位就能获得第三次连续多数政府。我想知道，当时的省长会在什么时候停止问自己这个问题：该死，如果我们能再赢一个席位，第三个任期会有多大的不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Your third election, October 6, 2011, was in some respects the most fascinating one because of course you came one seat short of a third consecutive majority government. And I wonder at what point does the premier of the day stop asking himself the question, damn it all, if only we could have won one more seat, how different that third term might have been.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 是的，这太令人惊讶了。史蒂夫，这太令人惊讶了。我记得和**史蒂芬·哈珀**（Steven Harper: 加拿大前总理）谈过。他说：“可惜您没有先经历少数政府。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's amazing. It's amazing, Steve. And I recall talking to um Steven Harper. He said, "Too bad you didn't have the minority first."</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't understand how challenging I didn't really understand how challenging a minority government was going to be.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您从未参与过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You'd never been part of one.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我从未参与过。对。有雷时代、哈里斯时代，我的前两届政府。就像，你知道，轻松自在，一帆风顺，对吧？您想要什么，然后就能完成。我们有足够的票数。

<p class="english-text">I'd never been part of one. Right. There was the Ray years, the Harris years, my first two governments. It was like, you know, easy breezy, smooth sailing here, right? You want something, then you get it done. We got the numbers.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，嗯，说到当头一棒。嗯，我很快就明白了，这不仅仅是议会规则的问题，而是反对党已经厌倦了我。他们厌倦了我。我已经在位很久了。他们连续赢得了两次，两次大比分的多数席位。他们认为，好吧，你知道，是时候改变了，对吧？是时候让我坐在那里，而麦金蒂最好坐在别处，离开这个地方了。所以，嗯，是的，我们没有最好的情感基础来建立温暖和模糊的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, talk about a cold shower. Um, I quickly came to understand how and it was not just the the um uh the the um the the parliamentary rules, but the opposition was sick of me. They were sick of me. I'd been around. They had won two in a row, two big majorities in a row. They thought, okay, you know, it's time for a change up here, right? It's time for me to sit over there and McGinty to sit ideally elsewhere outside of this place. So um yeah, we didn't have the best um kind of a emotional platform upon which to build um warm and fuzzy relationships.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我也喜欢在历史上指出，通过连续赢得三届选举，您是自19世纪**奥利弗·莫瓦特**（Oliver Mowat: 19世纪安大略省省长，自由党领袖，曾长期执政）以来最成功的自由党省长。是的。您当时也知道这一点吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I I like to note in history as well that by winning three in a row, you're the most successful liberal premier since Oliver Mitt in the 19th century. Yeah. Did you know that as well at the time?</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 是您告诉我的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，只差一个席位就达到多数意味着什么呢？就您在议会中推行任何您想要的计划的能力而言。那简直是地狱。简直是地狱。从预算到委员会，对吧？这意味着反对党基本上掌控着局面，我们想要取得任何进展都需要得到对方的支持。所以这变得缓慢而令人沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did one seat short of a majority mean though in terms of your ability to get whatever program you wanted to through the house? It was hell. It was hell. Like from budgets to committees, right? It meant that the opposition was by and large in charge and any progress we wanted to make uh required the support of somebody on the other side. So it became uh slow and frustrating.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 有很多敌意。嗯，我们当时，你知道，我想公平地说，作为一个群体，所有省议员，我们在为安大略省人民取得进展方面做得不够好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was um a lot of animosity. Um we were at you know I think I would say in fairness as a group all all the members of provincial parliament we were at less than our best in terms of making progress uh for Ontarians.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，所以，你知道，那是我的现实，所以我们只是尽力寻找方法，你知道，我们一开始通过了一项预算。我想，为了获得**新民主党**（NDP: New Democratic Party，加拿大主要政党之一，通常持左翼立场）的支持，他们期望对安大略省最富有的人征税，我们照做了。嗯，然后这有点像，你知道，一种按需定制的方式，看看您能在议会中提出什么，通过委员会，然后最终成为法律。所以工作量很大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and um so I I you know that that was my reality and so we just worked as hard as we could to find a way to you know we got a budget through at the outset.

Uh and then it was kind of a um you know uh kind of an a an asis basis to see what you could get tabled in the house pass through committee and then eventually become you know law.

<p class="english-text">You will be disappointed if I don't raise a few of the difficult times that you had.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No not yet. Not yet. got comfortable. In fact, because I do want to put a few of them on the record here.</p>
</details>

主持人: 围绕着**电子健康**（e-health: 指利用信息技术改进医疗保健服务和管理）出现了一个问题，为了创建一个数字化健康记录系统，某些环节被简化了。您的卫生部长因此辞职了。还有**橙色空中救护车**（Orange Air Ambulance: 安大略省的空中医疗运输服务，曾因财务管理问题引发争议）问题，他们涉嫌从事一些可疑的开支和商业行为。您最不愿提及的无疑是您最终取消了在奥克维尔和密西沙加的两个**燃气发电厂**（Gas plants: 使用天然气发电的设施），但其合同最终不得不支付，因此这些发电厂的取消花费了相当大的代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a problem around e- health where certain corners were cut in order to create a digitized health record system. Your health minister resigned over that one. There was the orange air ambulance problem where they were engaging in some questionable spending and business practices. Your favorite without question was the two gas plants that you ended up cancelling in Oakville and Missaga, but whose contracts</p>
</details>

主持人: 最终，嗯，不得不支付，因此这些工厂的取消花费了相当大的代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ultimately um had to be paid out and therefore at considerable expense those plants were cancelled.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我不想重新审理所有这些问题，并逐章逐句地讨论。但我对一个更大的问题感兴趣，那就是当一位省长身陷丑闻之中，每天他或她上班时，报纸都很糟糕，反对党也很糟糕，您无法摆脱它。在这种情况下取得成功，人们能从中吸取什么教训？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I don't want to relitigate all those issues and go through chapter and verse. But I but I am interested in the bigger question which is when a premier is in the midst of scandal and every day he or she comes to office the papers are awful, the opposition is awful, you can't get away from it. What are the lessons one takes away from succeeding under those circumstances?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，嗯，有几千个机构、委员会和委员会，所有党派的政府都对此负责。如果您对这些事情掉以轻心，嗯，它们可能会反过来咬您一口。这就是**电子健康**（e-health）、**橙色空中救护车**（Orange Air Ambulance）以及**安大略电力局**（OPA: Ontario Power Authority，安大略省的电力规划和采购机构）在选址燃气发电厂时发生的情况。我是否对此负责？当然。我们的民主就是这样运作的。这些委员会最终对我、我的政府、我们的内阁负责。所以，是的，挑战在于您有太多的事情要处理，嗯，这只是时间问题。我不在乎您是谁，嗯，您的政治立场是什么，在某个时候，总会出差错。我认为问题不在于是否会出差错，而在于您在出差错时如何反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um there are a few thousand agencies, boards and commissions for which governments of all stripes are responsible. If you take your eye off those things, uh they can come back and bite you. And that's what happened with e- health uh and with orange and with the OPA when it came to locating gas plants. Do I bear responsibility for those? Of course. That's how our democracy works. those boards are ultimately accountable to me, my government, our cabinet. So, yeah, that's the challenge though is you've got so many you got so many balls in the air uh that it's just a matter of time. I don't care who you are uh what your political stripe is, at some point in time there's going to be a slip. And I think the issue is not whether there's going to be a slip, it's how you react uh when there is that slip.</p>
</details>

主持人: 让我问一下。您有没有一天走进办公室，看着您的团队，也许是在燃气发电厂丑闻的第87天，然后说，你知道，伙计们，我们到底在这里做什么？我们能不能把事情做好？您有没有对团队发火？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask about that. Did you ever come into the office one day and look at your team on maybe day 87 of the gas plant scandal and say, you know, guys, what the hell are we doing here? Can we please get our act together? And like, did you lose your you know what with the with the team?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我不是一个爱吼叫的人。史蒂夫，我不是一个爱吼叫的人。你知道，嗯，我可能，你知道，嗯，毫无疑问地召集了我的高级团队，然后说：“嘿，你知道，我们会不会永远淹没在这件事里？我的意思是，嗯，这里有人看到陆地了吗？我们能从这片水域中出来，在某个时候擦干身体吗？这些事情来来去去。嗯，我并不是想贬低它们的重要性。嗯，但它们是健康、充满活力、动态民主的一部分。嗯，嗯，而且人们，反对党有权利，确实也有义务指出缺点。没有政府会把事情做得完美无缺。理想情况下，他们会做一些好事。嗯，公众有权看到，嗯，你知道，政府被追究责任。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not a screamer. I'm not a screamer, Steve. You know, um I might have, you know, um undoubtedly pulled together my senior team and said, "Hey, you know, are we are we going to are we going to drown in this forever? I mean, uh is there any Does anybody here see land? Are we are we gonna get out of this body of water and dry off at some point in time? These things come and go. Um and I'm not trying to diminish their importance. Uh but they are part of a healthy, vibrant, dynamic democracy. And um uh and people the opposition has right and indeed the obligation to point out shortcomings. No government is going to do things perfectly. Ideally, they're going to do some good things. uh and the public uh is entitled to see um you know the government being held to account."</p>
</details>

主持人: 然而，当您无法摆脱它时，首席部长每天是如何上班的？报纸上总是报道。人们大概在抗议和示威中对您大喊大叫，对吧？在这种情况下，您是如何保持理智的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does though how does the first minister show up for work every day when you can't get away from it? It's in the papers all the time.

Dalton McGuinty: 嗯，对我来说，这只是强烈的责任感。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um for me, it's just a strong sense of duty.</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 这是您的工作。您为此签约了。会有轻松的日子。会有艰难的日子。嗯，您不能只签下阳光。偶尔会有风暴。史蒂夫，我认为另一件事是，嗯，我也为我们所取得的成就感到非常自豪。嗯，我们被认为是**经合组织**（OECD: 经济合作与发展组织，一个由38个市场经济国家组成的国际组织）中拥有最好学校的国家。我们从加拿大最长的医疗等待时间变成了最短的医疗等待时间。我们为120万更多的安大略省居民找到了家庭医生。我们采用了**统一销售税**（HST: Harmonized Sales Tax，一种结合了联邦商品及服务税和省级销售税的税种），对吧？那曾被称为“第三轨”。麦金蒂，您碰了那个，您就完了。

<p class="english-text">It's your job. You signed on for it. There going to be some easy days. There going to be some hard days. Uh you can't just sign on for sunshine. They're going to be there going to be storms on occasion. And I think the other thing, Steve, is um I also took a lot of pride in um what we were able to achieve. Um we we were said to have the best schools in the OECD. We had we've gone we went from Canada's longest healthc care way times to its shortest healthcare way times. We found family doctors for 1.2 million more Ontarians. We adopted the HST, right? That was that was said to be the third rail. You touched that one, McGinty, you're dead.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我想，您是唯一一个推行了那种税制改革并赢得了下一次选举的人。其他人全都输了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're the only guy, I think, who brought in that kind of tax reform and won the next election. Everybody else lost, right?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 而且它至今仍在为安大略省的企业每年节省超过50亿美元。你知道，我们谈论燃煤电厂。史蒂夫，在我离开时，最糟糕的时候，安大略省南部每年有52个雾霾天。自从我们关闭最后一个燃煤电厂以来，我们有零个雾霾天。

When I left when at their worst, Steve, we had 52 smog days a year in southern Ontario. Since we shut down the last one, we've had zero.</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 所以，嗯，每个政府都会时不时地犯错。问题不在于您是否犯错，而在于您是否承认并采取措施确保它不再发生。例如，回到我改变主意并在2003年增税，在我说过我不会这样做之后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, every government is going to screw up from time to time. It's not whether you do, it's whether you acknowledge it and take steps to ensure it doesn't recur.

</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我们在安大略省通过了一项法律，规定在每次选举前，账目必须透明。这项法律被其他所有省份和联邦政府采纳了，对吧？所以您可以从这些事情中吸取教训，并采取措施确保它们不再发生。你知道，有人问我，你知道，您最自豪的倡议是什么？

You know, somebody asked me, you know, of which um initiative are you most proud?</p>
</details>

Dalton McGuinty: 我想可能是**全日制幼儿园**（Full day kindergarten: 一种学前教育项目，为儿童提供全天的教育和照护）。自从我们实施以来，每年有25万名儿童受益于早期教育。当我回想我作为党领袖的17年，**雅克**（Jacquu: 可能是指某位历史学家或评论员）说我是当今在世的任期最长的党领袖。

<p class="english-text">One question I've always wanted to ask you is that there has been a kind of a post-political life that many people who've enjoyed the kind of success you've had in politics take, which is you usually get enscconced at a very big law firm as a senior counsel and then you go sit on you know whatever a dozen different boards of directors and so on and you get rich frankly</p>

<p class="english-text">And so I didn't I didn't add I'm I'm a fellow at a couple universities as well. So I get to hang around young people, get to understand a world that I never grew up in. uh and they help teach me things so I can bring those to bear in decision-m that I may be making elsewhere. You got to, you know, life is short and you better do you better spend it doing things that um you really enjoy.</p>

<p class="english-text">When does a premier stop relitigating or rethinking all of the decisions that he or she made and think, you know, if only I'd done this, I should have done that. Why didn't I do it this way? Or do you still do that in your own head? You don't do that.</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 我接受我所做的一切。我从中吸取教训。理想情况下，我能够将这些传授给他人。我时不时地谈论领导力，例如，尤其是在我与年轻人一起工作时。我指导年轻人，还有一些商业领袖。所以不，我不会带着深深的遗憾回顾我在政治上的任何时光。我本可以做得更好吗？绝对可以。在任何努力中，谁又不能呢？但我认为，总的来说，我只是感到非常感激。我的意思是，嗯，安大略省现在有多少人？1600万？1500万人，随便多少。只有一个人能担任省长。我做了10年。

<p class="english-text">I I live with what I have done. I draw what lessons I I might from those. And ideally, I'm able to um impart that to others. I speak about leadership from time to time, for example, especially when I'm I'm uh working with uh young people. I mentor young people, a few business leaders as well. So no, I don't look back on my any of my time in politics with deep regret. Could I have done some things better? Absolutely. Who couldn't in any endeavor? But I think that uh on the whole I just I feel very grateful. I mean um what are there 16 million people in Ontario now? 15 million people, whatever the heck it is. One gets to serve as premier. I got to do that for 10 years.</p>

Dalton McGuinty: 因为，一分钟后，因为，你知道，能够处于一个位置，嗯，你知道政府真正的特权是什么。您可以定义公共利益。那是令人兴奋的事情。您认为对我们所有人来说什么是最好的？能够定义它，然后充实它，赋予它形状，并制定政策，对我来说，史蒂夫，在我们的学校、医疗保健、空气质量和经济实力方面做出改变，真是非常有意义。嗯，您还能在哪里做这些事情呢？你知道，我想**戴维斯**（Davis: 可能是指**比尔·戴维斯** Bill Davis，安大略省前省长）说过，嗯，比尔·戴维斯说过，私营部门最好的一天也无法与担任省长最糟糕的一天相比。只是，我的意思是，当您身居那个职位时，世界就是您的牡蛎，您可以做出如此多的改变。

<p class="english-text">because in a minute because it's you know to be in a position to um you know you know what the real privilege of of government is. You get to define the public interest. That's heady stuff. What do you think is the best for all of us? And to be in a position to define that and then flesh that out and lend shape to it and put in place policies to me it was so Steve it's just so exceptionally rewarding to have made differences in our schools and in our healthcare and the quality of our air and the strength of our economy. Um that's where else can you do that stuff? It's, you know, I think Davis said, um, Bill Davis said the best day in the private sector can't compare to the worst day as premier. It's just there's so I mean the world is your oyster when you're in that office and you can make so many changes.</p>
