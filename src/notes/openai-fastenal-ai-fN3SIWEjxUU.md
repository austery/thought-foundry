### OpenAI与博通的定制芯片合作

Bloomberg: A big market story today is the surge in semiconductors, led by Broadcom, whose stock jumped after OpenAI agreed to buy the company's custom chips and networking equipment in a multi-year deal, part of an ambitious plan by the startup to add AI infrastructure. We wanted to dig a little deeper into it, as we're certainly seeing it play out in the market. We're joined now by Bloomberg Intelligence Global Head of Technology Research, Mandep Singh, here in the studio. Mandep, walk us through this deal because it feels like every other day **OpenAI** (人工智能研究实验室: 一家致力于推广和开发友善人工智能的美国研究机构) has a new agreement with some chip manufacturer, and the terms are slightly different, whether it's an ownership stake or directly buying chips. What's the significance of this **Broadcom** (博通: 一家全球领先的半导体和基础设施软件解决方案供应商) pact?

**OpenAI** (人工智能研究实验室): 今天市场上的一个重要新闻是半导体板块的飙升，其中以博通领涨。**博通** (Broadcom: 一家全球领先的半导体和基础设施软件解决方案供应商) 的股价在OpenAI同意通过一项多年期协议购买其定制芯片和网络设备后大涨，这是这家初创公司增加人工智能基础设施雄心计划的一部分。我们想深入探讨一下，因为我们确实看到它正在市场上发挥作用。现在，彭博情报全球技术研究主管Mandep Singh来到了我们的演播室。Mandep，请为我们解读这项交易，因为感觉OpenAI几乎每天都会与某个芯片制造商达成新协议，而且条款略有不同，有时是股权，有时是直接购买芯片。这次与博通的协议有何意义？

Mandep: They are really pursuing data center capacity right now, and they're doing it by diversifying their supplier base. So, it's not just relying on Nvidia, which everyone does for compute, but also leveraging Broadcom, which is a **custom silicon** (定制芯片: 专为特定应用或工作负载设计和优化的集成电路) maker. Think of Nvidia giving you a generic chip where you can run various **AI workloads** (人工智能工作负载: 指训练或推理AI模型所需的计算任务), whether it's training or inferencing. Custom silicon is used specifically for the unique workflow that OpenAI needs to run for its proprietary model. No one else benefits from using a custom silicon because OpenAI isn't looking to sell its own chips to compete with Nvidia; it's using these chips for its own applications developed in-house. Google is a prime example of custom silicon with its own **TPUs** (Tensor Processing Units: 谷歌开发的专用集成电路，用于加速机器学习任务), which are more customized than **Nvidia GPUs** (图形处理器: 专门处理图像输出的芯片，也可用于并行计算加速AI) and do a terrific job running YouTube or other AI workloads Google wants to run. That's what OpenAI is doing, and it offers a tremendous cost advantage, costing much less than Nvidia's average $30,000 price tag for a GPU.

Mandep: 他们现在确实在追逐数据中心容量，而且他们通过多元化供应商基础来实现这一点。因此，他们不仅仅依赖目前所有人都用来进行计算的英伟达，还在利用博通，它是一家定制芯片制造商。可以这样理解：英伟达提供的是通用芯片，你可以在上面运行各种人工智能工作负载，无论是训练还是推理。而定制芯片则专门用于OpenAI为运行其专有模型所需的特定工作流程。其他公司使用定制芯片没有任何好处，因为OpenAI并不是想出售自己的芯片来与英伟达竞争；它寻求使用这些芯片来运行自己内部开发的芯片应用或任何其他定制应用。谷歌就是定制芯片的一个典型例子，他们有自己的TPU，与英伟达的GPU相比，它们在本质上更具定制性，但在运行YouTube或谷歌希望在其芯片上运行的任何其他人工智能工作负载方面表现出色。这就是OpenAI正在做的事情。而且它具有巨大的成本优势，因为它的成本远低于英伟达GPU平均3万美元的价格。

Bloomberg: What's interesting is that there's a trend to get chips that maybe don't cost as much, don't use as much power, but do exactly what's needed. Is that a fair assessment?

Bloomberg: 有趣的是，我确实觉得有一种趋势，就是获取那些成本可能不高、功耗可能不大，但却能精确满足我们需求的芯片。这种说法准确吗？

### 芯片成本、功耗与OpenAI的供应链策略

Mandep: One gigawatt requires up to 500,000 to 600,000 accelerator chips. So, for a one-gigawatt data center, we're talking about 0.5 to 0.6 million chips. Imagine the cost savings if you can save up to $5,000 per chip. The real constraint right now is power. It's not just about getting a cheaper chip; you still need performance per watt, which is why Nvidia is so good, offering 5 to 10 times more performance per watt than its nearest competitor.

Mandep: 一吉瓦 (gigawatt) 需要多达50万到60万个加速芯片。所以，对于一个一吉瓦的数据中心，我们谈论的是50万到60万个芯片。想象一下，如果你每个芯片能节省高达5000美元，那成本节约会是多么巨大。目前真正的制约是电力。并不是说你得到一个更便宜的芯片就万事大吉了。你仍然需要每瓦特的性能，这就是为什么英伟达如此出色，因为它比最接近的竞争对手提供了5到10倍的每瓦特性能。

Bloomberg: Exactly. We have a graphic showing OpenAI and all the companies they're striking deals with. In less than a month, from late September to mid-October, they've made deals with Nvidia, Oracle, Coreweave, AMD, and now Broadcom. Is this simply about giving them a smarter **supply chain** (供应链: 产品从原材料到最终消费者手中的整个过程所涉及的网络和系统) and access to what they need? Is it that simple?

Bloomberg: 没错。我们有一张图表，展示了OpenAI以及他们正在与之合作的所有公司。不到一个月的时间，从9月底到10月中旬，他们已经与英伟达、甲骨文、Coreweave、AMD以及现在的博通达成了协议。这是否仅仅是为了给他们提供一个更智能的供应链，并让他们能够获得所需的一切？有这么简单吗？

Mandep: It's not that simple because they're going across the stack. Consider how AI applications are deployed: you need the chip, the infrastructure, and the cloud, as that's where you perform your inferencing. So, they've struck deals with different parts of this stack—not just chip makers or power providers, but also cloud companies like Coreweave. From that perspective, they are aggressively adding more capacity than they probably need because they believe that by gaining market share and getting companies or users to adopt their product, they'll be able to monetize it and potentially drive some competitors out due to the sheer scale involved.

Mandep: 没那么简单，因为他们正在横跨整个技术栈。想想人工智能应用是如何部署的：你需要芯片、基础设施，还需要云服务，因为那正是你进行推理的地方。所以，他们已经与这个技术栈的不同部分达成了协议，不只是芯片制造商，不只是电力供应商，还有像Coreweave这样的云服务商。从这个角度看，他们正在积极地增加可能超出其需求的容量，因为他们认为，如果能获得市场份额，让公司或用户使用他们的产品，他们就能实现盈利，并可能由于所涉及的规模，将一些竞争公司挤出市场。

Bloomberg: Are XAI and Anthropic striking similar deals, or is this primarily an OpenAI initiative?

Bloomberg: 那么，XAI和Anthropic是否也在达成类似的交易，还是这只是OpenAI的独角戏？

Mandep: I think XAI is certainly considering this; they are pursuing a $20 billion deal with some private financing. But when OpenAI announces a 10-gigawatt deal, we're talking about $500 billion, not $20 billion anymore. The numbers are just getting bigger and bigger.

Mandep: 我想XAI肯定在考虑这一点；他们正在通过一些私人融资寻求一笔200亿美元的交易。但你看，当OpenAI宣布一笔10吉瓦的交易时，我们谈论的是5000亿美元，而不是200亿美元了。这些数字正在变得越来越大。

### OpenAI的盈利能力与基础设施投入

Bloomberg: So, as of October 13th, is OpenAI the most important company in the world right now?

Bloomberg: 那么，在此时此刻，10月13日，OpenAI是世界上最重要的公司吗？

Mandep: Well, when I look at the **Magnificent Seven** (七巨头: 指美国股市中市值最大的七家科技公司：苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、英伟达、特斯拉和Meta), Broadcom is not among them, yet it's a $1.6 trillion company. OpenAI, while its partners' stocks are up 10% because of these deals (though the entire sector sold off on Friday), isn't even public or profitable, as far as we know, right?

Mandep: 嗯，当我提到**七巨头** (Magnificent Seven: 指美国股市中市值最大的七家科技公司：苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、英伟达、特斯拉和Meta) 时，博通并不在其中，但它是一家1.6万亿美元的公司。OpenAI，其合作伙伴的股价因此上涨了10%（尽管上周五整个板块都有所下跌），但据我们所知，它甚至没有上市，也没有盈利，对吧？

Mandep: No, if you factor in their training costs, their gross margins would currently be negative. In terms of inferencing, yes, they are making some money, but if you include everything and compare it with Google, Google has an annual cost of revenue of around $100 billion that powers all their apps—Google, YouTube, everything they run. OpenAI's compute costs are probably over $20 billion right now. If they're adding 26 gigawatts more capacity, we're talking about compute costs multiplying at least 25-fold. From that perspective, you have to ask yourself how much incremental revenue you need to see from OpenAI to justify this potentially $1 trillion in compute infrastructure spending. This is where Google's infrastructure is so efficient, as less than 5 gigawatts of compute generates over $400 billion in revenue.

Mandep: 不，如果把他们的训练成本考虑进去，他们目前的毛利率将是负数。就推理而言，是的，他们确实赚了一些钱，但如果把所有费用都算进去，并与谷歌进行比较，谷歌的年收入成本约为1000亿美元，这支撑着他们所有的应用，包括谷歌、YouTube以及他们运营的一切。OpenAI目前的计算成本可能超过200亿美元。如果他们再增加26吉瓦的容量，我们谈论的是计算成本至少会增加25倍。从这个角度来看，你必须问自己，OpenAI需要产生多少增量收入才能证明这笔可能高达1万亿美元的计算基础设施支出是合理的。这就是谷歌基础设施效率如此之高的原因，因为不到5吉瓦的计算量就能带来超过4000亿美元的收入。

### Fastenal财报与工业经济活动分析

Bloomberg: That's pretty cool, to say the least, in non-financial analysis terminology. Mandep, thank you. Always a gem. Mandep Singh, Bloomberg Intelligence Global Head of Technology Research. AI spending and infrastructure buildout provide one perspective on the US economy, particularly the tech economy. Now, for another key indicator of US economic activity, we turn to the industrial supplier **Fastenal** (快扣: 一家工业和建筑用品分销商), which reported earnings earlier this morning. Its shares were, at one point, the worst-performing in the **S&P 500** (标准普尔500指数: 包含美国500家市值最大上市公司股票的指数), currently down about 6%. Keep in mind, this is a $50 billion company, no small player in the industrial space. It's one of the first reports we get each earnings season, and it broadly missed Wall Street expectations. So, what's driving that? Let's ask CEO Daniel Florness, Chief Executive Officer of Fastenal, who joins us from Winona, Minnesota. Dan, it's great to have you back. Talk to us about the quarter, because analysts noted that pricing during the quarter was weaker than expected, marking the second straight quarter of softer pricing, which might explain the stock decline. What do you want to tell investors?

Bloomberg: 至少从非金融分析的术语来看，这相当了不起。Mandep，谢谢你。你总是那么出色。彭博情报全球技术研究主管Mandep Singh。人工智能支出和基础设施建设是解读美国经济，特别是科技经济的一个视角。现在，我们转向另一个关于美国经济活动的重要读数，那就是工业供应商**快扣** (Fastenal: 一家工业和建筑用品分销商) 公司，它在今天早上早些时候公布了财报。它的股价一度是**标准普尔500指数** (S&P 500: 包含美国500家市值最大上市公司股票的指数) 中表现最差的，目前下跌了约6%。请记住，这是一家500亿美元的公司，在工业领域绝非小角色。这是我们每个季度财报季最早获得的信息之一，它普遍低于华尔街的预期。那么，是什么导致了这种情况呢？我们来问问首席执行官Daniel Florness，他是快扣公司的首席执行官，他从明尼苏达州维诺纳市加入我们。Dan，很高兴你再次回来。请告诉我们关于这个季度的情况，因为分析师们注意到这个季度的定价弱于预期，这标志着连续第二个季度定价疲软，也许这就是我们看到股价下跌的原因。你想对投资者说些什么？

Dan: Part of the reason our stock is down is that it's been priced to perfection, considering its year-to-date performance and where its multiple has gone. However, we had a really good quarter, achieving double-digit growth, which we hadn't seen for a couple of years. We are pleased with the outcome. One of the challenges this year was the fluidity around **tariffs** (关税: 国家对进出口商品征收的税费) and their implications for pricing. We will raise prices to address costs in our customer supply chain. We really don't want to raise prices more than that because we believe it impairs our ability to grow as fast as we'd like. Coming into the quarter, our estimated impact of pricing came in a little less than expected. We lowered our outlook for the fourth quarter, but the most important aspect is that on a price-cost basis, we are neutral, and that's what we aspire to be. We'd rather just focus on growth.

Dan: 我们的股价下跌部分原因是，考虑到它今年迄今的表现以及市盈率的走势，它已被定价到极致。然而，我们度过了一个非常好的季度，实现了两位数的增长，这是我们几年未见的。我们对结果感到满意。今年我们面临的一个挑战是**关税** (Tariffs: 国家对进出口商品征收的税费) 的不确定性以及它对定价的影响。我们将提高价格以应对客户供应链中的成本。我们真的不想提高更多，因为我们认为这会损害我们实现预期增长速度的能力。进入本季度时，我们对定价影响的估计略低于实际情况。我们下调了第四季度的预期，但最重要的是，在价格-成本基础上，我们是中性的，这也是我们所追求的目标。我们宁愿只专注于增长。

Bloomberg: And Dan, to your point, Fastenal, even with today's pullback, has returned 22% year-to-date, outperforming the S&P 500 and comparable industrial stocks. Just one more question on pricing expectations: would you want to raise pricing? Do you get the sense that consumers and customers would push back, especially given your shift towards bigger customers who spend much more money?

Bloomberg: Dan，根据你的观点，即使今天有所回调，快扣今年迄今的回报率仍达到22%，跑赢了标准普尔500指数和工业领域的同类股票。关于定价预期，我还有一个问题：你们会希望提高定价吗？鉴于你们一直在转向消费更多资金的大客户，你是否觉得消费者和客户会因此抵制？

### 客户抵制与关税压力

Dan: Yes, customers always push back on pricing, regardless of their size. We are having conversations with our customers and will implement some price increases in Q4. I suspect we'll continue with some price increases as we move into 2026. But again, our initial discussion with the customer—they understand it and are willing to negotiate on price. Our first discussion is always about alternatives for this product that might mean we don't have to raise your prices by 5%; perhaps it only needs to be 2%, and we'd rather aim for 2% because that's what a supply chain partner does.

Dan: 是的，客户总是会就定价问题进行抵制，无论客户规模大小。我们正在与客户进行沟通，并将在第四季度进行一些价格上涨。我预计进入2026年我们也会进行一些价格上涨。但再次强调，我们与客户的首次讨论——他们理解并愿意在价格上进行调整。我们首次讨论的总是关于该产品的替代方案，这可能意味着我们不必将你的价格提高5%；也许只需要提高2%，我们宁愿选择2%，因为这就是供应链合作伙伴所做的。

Bloomberg: Dan, how do tariffs factor into this? Analysts across the street suggest that for certain industries, tariffs will start appearing in third-quarter guidance related to 2026. What are you observing, and how are you addressing any pressures from tariffs?

Bloomberg: Dan，关税是如何融入这一切的呢？鉴于华尔街分析师认为，当我们审视某些行业时，现在正是关税开始在第三季度财报指引中体现出来的时候，这与2026年有关。你看到了什么，以及你如何应对或处理关税带来的任何压力？

Dan: For us, tariffs have been part of the equation since early in the second quarter, and a bit in the first quarter. Historically, the individual handling pricing would provide us with a monthly update. By July, he was not only providing updates but had produced 14 videos for the field, guiding them on what we were observing in our supply chain. So, we've been adjusting prices throughout the year, and these have been discussions with customers. I hope that answers your question.

Dan: 对我们来说，关税自第二季度初，甚至第一季度末，就已经纳入考量。负责定价的同事，以前每月会给我们提供一次更新。到七月，他不仅提供更新，还为现场团队制作了14个视频，指导他们了解我们在供应链中观察到的情况。因此，我们今年一直在调整价格，并且这些都是与客户讨论的结果。我希望这能回答你的问题。

Bloomberg: I think it does. But the main question is: are you mitigating the impact of tariffs? Are you shifting your supply chain? Is there an expectation of a knock-on effect on pricing if we continue to see threats from the President targeting countries like China or others? We're going to speak with a member of Levi's management team, and they've indicated they had to increase their expectations for the impact of tariffs from other countries. So, how is that impacting your supply chain and the potential for pricing impacts in 2026?

Bloomberg: 我认为是的。但关键问题是：你们是否正在减轻关税的影响？你们是否正在调整供应链？如果总统继续威胁针对中国或其他国家，是否预期会对定价产生某种连锁反应？我们将与Levi’s管理团队的一名成员交谈，他们表示不得不提高对其他国家关税影响的预期。那么，当你审视自己的供应链以及2026年可能出现的定价影响时，这会产生怎样的影响？

### 全球供应链多元化与物流调整

Dan: We've been actively shifting our supply chain around the globe since the 2017-2018 timeframe. As our name implies, we sell a lot of fasteners, and most fasteners in North America traditionally come from mainland China or Taiwan. The automotive industry moved production there back in the 50s and 60s, initially to Japan and South Korea, and then it migrated from there. Looking at our resources, we now have sourcing teams in Shanghai, Bangkok, and northern India. We've worked to diversify our supplier base globally, and a bit more in North America, to ensure supply diversity so we're not caught off guard by price or tariff changes. In addition, we've rerouted supply chains that traditionally entered North America through the US West Coast for redistribution. Now, products are brought directly into the west coast of Canada or Mexico, as these two countries represent about 14% of our revenue. This allows us to bypass tariffs. While it's more expensive to break down shipments in Asia and bring them in this way, it's significantly less costly than paying tariffs.

Dan: 自2017-2018年以来，我们一直在全球范围内积极调整供应链。顾名思义，我们销售大量紧固件，而北美大部分紧固件传统上来自中国大陆或台湾。汽车行业在五六十年代将生产转移到那里，实际上是先转移到日本和韩国，然后从那里再迁移。看看我们的资源，我们现在在上海、曼谷和印度北部都设有采购团队。我们致力于在全球范围内，以及在北美地区进一步多元化我们的供应商基础，以确保供应的多样性，这样就不会因为价格或关税变化而措手不及。除此之外，我们还调整了进入北美的供应链，这些供应链传统上通过美国西海岸进入，然后我们再从那里进行再分配。现在，产品直接运往加拿大西海岸或墨西哥西海岸，因为这两个国家约占我们收入的14%。这样就可以避开关税。虽然在亚洲拆分货物并以这种方式运入成本更高，但这比关税要便宜得多。

### 降低对中国市场的依赖与工业环境的低迷

Bloomberg: Dan, you're talking about supply chains. Is the ultimate goal largely reducing your exposure to China, which has been quite significant?

Bloomberg: Dan，你谈到了供应链。最终目标是否主要是减少你们对中国的敞口，因为这个敞口一直相当大？

Dan: It's about reducing our customers' exposure to any market—in this case, China and/or Taiwan—but to any market that is susceptible to political shifts and creates an unstable supply base for our customers. Currently, it happens to be China. Next month it might be a different country; next year, another. It's about diversifying your supply chain so your eggs aren't all in one basket. You have to be ready for whatever direction the winds blow, for the customer.

Dan: 这是为了减少我们客户对任何市场的风险敞口，在这种情况下是中国和/或台湾，但也是针对任何受到政治风向影响并为我们的客户造成不稳定供应基础的市场。现在恰好是中国。下个月可能是一个不同的国家；明年也可能是一个不同的国家。这是为了使你的供应链多元化，这样你就不会把所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里。必须做好准备，无论风向如何变化，都要为客户提供服务。

Bloomberg: Speaking broadly about today's earnings update, you mentioned the industrial environment is still sluggish. We've heard similar comments about this persistent sluggishness from other manufacturers, as well as caution regarding project delays. At what point does this become more worrying than just sluggishness?

Bloomberg: 广泛地谈谈今天的财报更新，你提到工业环境仍然低迷。我们从其他制造商那里也听到了关于这种持续低迷的类似评论，以及对项目延迟的担忧。在什么情况下，这种情况会变得比仅仅是低迷更令人担忧？

Dan: For us, it's been sluggish since November 2022. We closely monitor the **PMI index** (采购经理人指数: 衡量制造业和服务业经济活动的指标) released by the Institute for Supply Management. This index has been below 50, which significantly impacts our customer base. Except for January and February of this year, it has remained below 50 since November 2022. So, from our perspective, we've been in a sluggish economy for a long time. Beyond experiencing the initial phase where customers were downshifting, our growth is now shining through differently. First, I believe we're executing at a higher level. Second, once you get past that downshifting period, even if your customers are operating at a subdued level, you can still achieve growth in such an environment, and that's what our current numbers reflect.

Dan: 对我们来说，自2022年11月以来，经济一直低迷。我们非常关注美国供应管理协会发布的**采购经理人指数** (PMI index: 衡量制造业和服务业经济活动的指标)。除了今年1月和2月，该指数自2022年11月以来一直低于50，这对我们的客户基础产生了实际影响。因此，从我们的角度来看，我们长期处于一个低迷的经济环境中。除了经历最初客户需求下降的阶段，现在我们的增长以不同的方式显现出来。首先，我认为我们的执行力达到了更高的水平。其次，一旦度过了需求下降期，即使客户处于低迷状态，你也能在这种环境下实现增长，这正是我们目前数据所反映的。

### 人工智能对Fastenal业务的影响

Bloomberg: One thing I want to ask you: I don't know how pervasive AI is in your world, but it's a non-stop conversation for us, especially regarding activity and market impact. To what extent is AI potentially "sucking up the oxygen" in the economy? Are you seeing any signs of that, or will your world still need what you supply, regardless of AI spending and enthusiasm?

Bloomberg: 有一件事我想问你：我不知道人工智能在你的世界里有多普遍，但对我们来说，它是一个永无止境的话题，尤其是在活动和市场影响方面。人工智能在多大程度上可能“吸走了经济中的氧气”？你是否看到了任何迹象，或者无论人工智能支出和热情如何，你们的世界仍然需要你们供应的产品？

Dan: First off, we've seen a meaningful improvement in our revenue related to areas like data centers. We serve a wide range of customer and end-market needs, whether it's the actual construction—I've visited many data centers under construction where we have people on-site. After construction, we supply those facilities with items like air handling and maintenance equipment. For customers selling into that sector, that's currently a strong business for us. Furthermore, as an organization, we're increasingly utilizing AI in our own business, in our market approach, and in helping our employees be more efficient.

Dan: 首先，我们在数据中心等相关领域的收入有了显著增长。我们服务于广泛的客户需求和终端市场需求，无论是实际建设——我参观过许多正在建设的数据中心，我们都有人员在现场。建成后，我们为这些设施提供空气处理和维护设备等物品。对于那些向该领域销售产品的客户来说，这实际上是我们目前一项强劲的业务。此外，作为一个组织，我们正越来越多地在自己的业务中、在我们的市场推广方式中，以及在帮助员工提高工作效率方面，利用人工智能。

Bloomberg: Dan, with about 45 seconds left, considering data center construction, where are those products sourced from? Are they also heavily sourced from China and exposed to tariffs, or do they come from entirely different supply chains?

Bloomberg: Dan，还剩下大约45秒，考虑到数据中心建设，这些产品是从哪里采购的？它们是否也大量来自中国并受到关税影响，还是完全不同的供应链？

Dan: They mostly come from different supply sources. However, it depends on the component; if they are facility maintenance products, they can come from anywhere globally and are subject to the same issues any product would face. But for many components, I know many manufacturers we sell to—I visited one about a year ago in Michigan—were purposely avoiding China and selling directly into data centers.

Dan: 它们大多来自不同的供应源。但这取决于组件；如果是设施维护类的产品，它们可能来自全球任何地方，因此会面临任何产品都可能遇到的问题。但对于许多组件，我知道我们销售给的许多制造商——我大约一年前在密歇根州拜访过一家——他们特意避开中国，直接向数据中心销售。

Bloomberg: You've been at Fastenal for a long time and have seen different cycles. How would you describe this current one, very quickly, in about 20 seconds?

Bloomberg: 你在快扣工作了很长时间，也经历过不同的经济周期。你如何描述当前的这个周期，请非常简要地在20秒内说明？

Dan: It's odd, similar to what we saw in 2018, but it's particularly strange due to its extreme fluidity. So many things occur week to week, month to month, that are outside the norm, yet the fundamentals still work.

Dan: 这是一个奇怪的周期，与我们2018年看到的情况类似，但不同之处在于它极度不稳定。每周、每月都有许多超出常规的事情发生，但基本面依然有效。

Bloomberg: All right. Serve your customer at a high level, and you grow your business. Love talking with you, Dan Florness, the CEO of Fastenal.

Bloomberg: 好的。高水平地服务你的客户，你就能发展你的业务。很高兴与你交谈，快扣公司的首席执行官Dan Florness。
