title: 挪威财政规则：石油财富的跨代管理与经济稳定之道
summary: 本文探讨了挪威如何通过其独特的“支出规则”（财政规则）有效管理庞大的石油和天然气收入。该规则旨在确保跨代公平，将所有石油收入注入主权财富基金，每年仅支出其金融回报的3%，从而稳定经济并避免“荷兰病”。文章还讨论了该规则在实现政治共识和应对市场波动方面的成功与挑战，强调了规则公信力的重要性。

### 挪威支出规则的诞生与运作

挪威有一项被称为**支出规则**（håndlingsregel: 挪威管理石油财富的财政规则）的制度，这项规则规定了挪威**主权财富基金**（Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund: 挪威政府管理石油收入的基金）每年可以有多少资金用于支持国家预算，它确实成为了挪威经济规划的基石。

<p class="english-text">In Norway, we have something called the spending rule, or 'håndlingsregel', which you, as a brilliant student of Economics, worked on, and then as a Minister of Finance and Prime Minister. It's a rule which tells how much of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund can be spent every year to support the budget, and it has truly been a cornerstone in the economic planning of this country.</p>
</details>

这项规则的设立目的实际上是双重的：其一是为了确保不仅我们这一代，而且子孙后代都能受益于我们在**挪威大陆架**（Norwegian continental shelf: 挪威沿海的海洋区域，富含石油和天然气）上发现的石油和天然气资源——这是一种长远的视角。设立财政规则和养老基金的另一个原因是稳定挪威经济，将收入与支出分开，并防止经济过热。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The purpose was actually twofold: one was to ensure that not only our generation but also future generations would benefit from the oil and gas resources we found on the Norwegian continental shelf – that's the long-term perspective. The other reason to establish the fiscal rule and the pension fund was to stabilize the Norwegian economy, to separate earnings from spending, and to prevent the economy from overheating.</p>
</details>

那么，是什么促使您制定这项规则呢？当时我们认识到，挪威将从石油和天然气中获得比预期多得多的收入。因此，当我于2000年担任首相时，我们获得净石油收入才仅仅几年；第一笔净石油收入于1996年进入挪威，最初数额很小。那时，我们显然需要一种方式来决定可以支出多少，并且非常担心我们所说的**荷兰病**（Dutch Disease: 因自然资源出口导致本币升值，损害其他产业竞争力的经济现象），即支出过多。因此，我们启动了一场部分是学术性、部分是政治性的讨论，探讨如何建立一项财政规则来决定我们可以支出多少石油收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What inspired the creation of this rule was the understanding that Norway was going to receive much larger oil and gas revenues than we had expected. Therefore, when I was Prime Minister in 2000, we had only had net oil revenues for a few years; the first net oil revenues came to Norway in 1996, and initially they were quite small. It then became obvious that we needed a way to decide how much we could spend, and we were very afraid of what we referred to as Dutch disease, meaning spending too much. Consequently, we initiated both an academic and a political discussion on how to establish a fiscal rule for how much of the oil revenues we could spend.</p>
</details>

因此，我们设立了一个养老基金，第一笔资金于1996年拨入该基金。但同样重要的或许是这项财政规则，我们决定所有石油和天然气收入都将进入挪威养老基金，而我们唯一会支出的，是其金融回报，我们估计平均每年收益率为3%。因此，这项财政规则规定，我们平均每年只应支出估计为3%的财政回报，而这已为挪威带来了巨大的益处。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Therefore, we established a pension fund, and the first money was allocated to it in 1996. But perhaps equally important was this fiscal rule, where we decided that all oil and gas revenues would go into the Norwegian pension fund, and that the only thing we would spend was the financial return, which we estimate to be an average of 3% in yield terms per year. Thus, the fiscal rule states that we should only spend, on average, the estimated 3% fiscal return, and that has served Norway very well.</p>
</details>

### 规则的成功与挑战

围绕如此庞大资源的支出达成政治共识，这本身就是一项了不起的成就，也可能是该基金的主要成功之一。这项规则的运作甚至比预期更好，部分原因是该基金因多种原因变得比我们预期的要大得多：挪威大陆架的石油和天然气产量更高，价格也更高，而且由于像您这样的人能够出色地管理基金，我们也获得了良好的投资。因此，所有这些因素的结合使得基金规模大增，从而也使财政规则变得更加重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's quite a feat to manage to get political consensus around the spending of such vast resources, and it's probably one of the main successes of the fund. Has it worked the way you thought? Yes, and if anything, it has worked even better, partly because the fund has become much bigger than we expected for many reasons: oil and gas production on the Norwegian continental shelf has been greater, prices have been higher, and we've also had good investments because people like you have been able to manage the fund very well. So, the combination of all these things has made the fund much bigger and, therefore, the fiscal rule even more important.</p>
</details>

如果，在制定财政规则时，也制定了一项规则，规定该基金总共可以贡献预算的百分之多少，您认为这个百分比会是多少？我认为会低于目前的百分比，现在大约是25%，或者说挪威国家支出或国家预算的近四分之一是由石油基金的回报资助的。我无法给您一个确切的数字，但我认为重要的是要理解存在一些担忧，我谨慎地不深入探讨那个辩论，因为那是一个非常挪威化的辩论，而且我谨慎地不就我近年来没有密切关注的问题发表过于具体的意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If, at the time the fiscal rule was made, you had also created a rule for how much, in total, the fund could contribute as a percentage of the budget, what do you think that percentage would have been? I think it would have been lower than the current percentage, which I believe is now around 25%, or roughly almost one-quarter of the Norwegian state expenditure or state budget, financed by the return from the oil fund. So, instead of 25%, what do you think it would have been? I'm not able to give you an exact number, but I think it's important to understand that there are concerns, and I'm careful not to delve too much into that debate because it's a very Norwegian debate, and I'm careful about being too specific on issues I haven't worked closely with in recent years.</p>
</details>

但早在2000年我们制定财政规则时的想法是，这项规则可以永远持续下去，因为从某种意义上说，挪威从未动用过石油收入的本金；我们所支出的只是石油收入的财政回报。当然，只要我们有投资，这种模式就可以永远持续下去。挑战在于，我们现在有如此多的财富投资于股票市场，这意味着可能会出现巨大的波动，这可能对挪威经济产生影响。这是我们以前从未面临过的新风险，至少不是以同样的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the idea back in 2000, when we made the fiscal rule, was that it could last forever because, in a way, Norway has spent zero of the oil revenues; the only thing we have spent is the fiscal return on the oil revenues. And of course, that can last forever, as long as we have the investment. The challenge, and you know that better than anyone else, is that we now have so much of our wealth in the stock market, which means there can be big fluctuations that can impact the Norwegian economy. That's a new risk we didn't face, at least not in the same way, before.</p>

### 公信力与政治智慧

因此，我总是对频繁修改这类财政规则持谨慎态度，因为那会损害其公信力。或许，拥有一条虽不完美但可信的规则，胜过总是追求一条更完美的却不断被修改的规则。这是因为这是一项自我施加的限制，而最大的成功在于，挪威这样一个民主社会，能够处理如此巨额的现金而没有将其挥霍掉。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I'm always a bit careful about changing these kinds of fiscal rules too often, because that will undermine their credibility. Perhaps it's better to have an imperfect rule that is credible than to always try to strive for a more perfect rule that is constantly changed. This is because it is a self-imposed restriction, and the biggest success, in a way, is that a democratic society like Norway has been able to handle this enormous amount of cash without spending it.</p>
</details>

我记得在1990年代，当我们进行这场讨论并开始投资股票，首次向养老基金拨款时，许多专家，包括我的经济学家同事，都说这不可能实现。他们认为，民主机构和政治家一旦拿到钱就会花掉。因此，他们实际上主张减少石油和天然气产量，将财富留在大陆架。事实上，**挪威中央银行**（Norwegian Central Bank: 挪威的中央银行，负责货币政策和金融稳定）前行长**班克·哈尔·斯坎**（Bank Har Scan）曾领导一个专家小组，他们也表示这行不通；政治家一旦拿到钱就会花掉。我们已经证明他们错了，这正是最大的成功。但再次强调，如果您开始过于频繁地修改这些规则，您可能会在某种程度上破坏“沙线”（Line in the Sand: 指不可逾越的界限或原则）的魔力，而这正是财政规则的精髓。我想我们可以说：“挪威的政治家们做得好！”以及“财政部长和**挪威银行投资管理公司**（Norges Bank Investment Management: 负责管理挪威主权财富基金的机构）的管理层做得好！”，他们都尽职尽责。

<p class="english-text">I remember back in the 1990s, when we had this discussion and started to invest in equities and made the first allocation to the pension fund, many experts, including economist colleagues of mine, said this could not happen. They argued that democratic institutions and politicians would spend the money if they got it. So, they were actually in favor of reducing oil and gas production to keep the wealth in the continental shelf. In fact, the former Governor of the Norwegian Central Bank, Bank Har Scan, led an expert group, and they said it cannot work; politicians will spend if they get the money. We have proven them wrong, and that's the biggest success. But again, if you start to change these rules too often, you may undermine, in a way, the magic of the 'Line in the Sand,' which is the fiscal rule. I think we can say, 'Well done, Norwegian politicians,' and 'Well done, the Minister of Finance and the management of Norges Bank Investment Management,' who have all been responsible.</p>
