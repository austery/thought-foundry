### 引言：网络安全的重要性与Palo Alto Networks

大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金（**Norges Bank Investment Management**: 挪威央行投资管理公司，负责管理挪威政府全球养老基金）的首席执行官Nikola Tangen，今天我非常荣幸能与Palo Alto Networks的首席执行官Nikesh Arora进行一次愉快的对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm Nicolola Tangan, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm in really good company with Nikesh Aurora, the CEO of Palo Alto Networks.</p>
</details>

Palo Alto Networks是网络安全领域的全球领导者，其重要性在当今时代前所未有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palo Alto Networks is the world leader within cyber security which has never been more important than today.</p>
</details>

我们持有该公司1.2%的股份，价值超过10亿美元。非常感谢Nikesh抽出时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We own 1.2% of the company translating into more than $1 billion. Thank you so much Dash for taking the time.</p>
</details>

谢谢你，Nikola。很高兴再次见到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you Nikolai. Lovely to see you again.</p>
</details>

现在，我们从基础开始。你们公司是做什么的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, uh let's uh start off with the basics. What do you guys do?</p>
</details>

这是一个好问题。随着世界的数字化，随着我们所有人采用技术，无论是在我们的智能手机上，还是公司向所有人提供应用程序，不良行为者进入公司系统或我们个人系统的可能性都在增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a good question. Look, as the world has digitized, as we've all adopted technology, whether it's on our smartphones or as companies make applications available to everyone, um the possibilities of bad actors getting into company systems or our personal systems goes up and our job is to protect that technology infrastructure from bad actors.</p>
</details>

因此，我们从事网络安全业务，旨在保护我们的企业客户、政府和个人免受不良行为者的攻击、入侵或胁迫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we are in the business of cyber security which is to protect our enterprise customers, governments and individuals from being hacked or attacked or coerced by bad actors.</p>
</details>

### 网络安全：不断扩大的攻击面与AI的挑战

现在的问题是，如今一切都已数字化，对吧？你的汽车、街灯等等。那么，整个攻击面（**Attack Surface**: 指一个系统或网络中所有可能被未授权访问或攻击的入口点）正在发生什么变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the thing is that everything is digital these days right your car uh you know street lights uh so what's kind of happening with the whole attack surface.</p>
</details>

这是一个非常好的评论，Nikola，因为你说得很对。我们称之为“攻击面”，而这个攻击面正在不断扩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well it's a great great comment Nikolai because uh you said it right. We call this the attack surface and the attack surface is expanding and I think we're not done.</p>
</details>

我认为我们还没有结束，正如你所说，如果你在旧金山驾驶一辆**Waymo**（Waymo: 谷歌母公司Alphabet旗下的自动驾驶技术公司）汽车，那是你的车，但它现在完全连接到一个中央神经系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as you said you know if you drive around in San Francisco in a Whimo that's your car but the car is now fully connected to some central nervous system and if a bad actor could get their hands on that control systems to your car they can control your car.</p>
</details>

如果一个不良行为者能够控制你的汽车的控制系统，他们就能控制你的汽车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if a bad actor could get their hands on that control systems to your car they can control your car.</p>
</details>

因此，随着我们创造越来越多的技术，越来越多的互联互通，我们也在为不良行为者创造机会，让他们介入并开始干扰或接管这个攻击面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as we create more and more technology, more and more interconnectivity, we are creating the opportunity for bad actors to get involved and start to interfere or start to take over this attack surface.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，攻击面正在从根本上爆炸式增长，并将继续爆炸式增长，这使得我们必须更快、更实时地保护这些情况变得越来越重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yes, the attack surface is fundamentally exploding but continue to explode which makes it more and more important for us to make sure that we are able to protect those situations faster and faster and faster and more real time as we can.</p>
</details>

你们工作中最困难的部分是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the most difficult part of what you do?</p>
</details>

最困难的部分是，局面被不公平地堆叠起来了。不良行为者只需要做对一次，而我们必须百分之百的时间都做对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">The most difficult part is the the the tables are unfairly stacked. The bad actor has to be right once and we have to be right 100% of the time.</p>
</details>

这很难做到。你们是如何做到的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's hard to do. How do you do it?</p>
</details>

通过越来越多的技术。我们都在谈论人工智能（**AI**: Artificial Intelligence），我相信我们也会谈到它，但我们必须能够在事情发生时识别它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh more and more technology. You know, uh we all talk about AI and I'm sure we'll talk about it, but uh we have to be able to identify things as they're happening.</p>
</details>

我们必须能够在干草堆里寻找那根针。而今天，随着世界上漂浮的数据量，以及我们谈到的互联互通的程度，唯一能够高效、有效地实时做到这一点的方法，就是使用相同的技术来保护我们自己免受网络威胁，就像我们用它来方便我们的生活一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have to be able to look for the needle in the haststack. And today with the amount of data that's floating around in the world, the amount of connectivity as we talked about that is going on, the only way to do it efficiently, effectively, and in real time is to use the same technology to protect ourselves against cyber threats that we are using to make our lives convenient.</p>
</details>

人工智能如何改变了你们的工作方式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How has AI changed the way you work?</p>
</details>

我认为人工智能将改变一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I think AI is going to change everything.</p>
</details>

我们几乎每周都能看到人工智能的新化身，它变得越来越智能。我将其比作拥有一个非常聪明的人为你工作，这个人不会忘记任何事情，知道世界上发生的一切，并且知道如何识别模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it's almost as we you know we beginning to see every week there's a net new incarnation of AI and you can see it keeps getting smarter and the way I way I sort of correlate this is like AI is like having a really smart person that you can have work for you this person doesn't forget anything this person knows everything that's ever happened in the world this person knows how to recognize patterns and what's happening is that that person is over time going to become smarter than the average employee and be able to either assist the current employees in the task and possibly take over their tasks.</p>
</details>

随着时间的推移，这个人将变得比普通员工更聪明，能够协助现有员工完成任务，甚至可能接管他们的任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's happening is that that person is over time going to become smarter than the average employee and be able to either assist the current employees in the task and possibly take over their tasks.</p>
</details>

这同样适用于网络安全，对吧？如果你能拥有一个拥有无限记忆、无限模式识别能力的人，那么问题是，我能否用我的信息来训练它，使其对我们更有效、更有帮助？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that also applies to cyber security, right? If you can have somebody has infinite memory, infinite pattern recognition, then the question is, can I train it with my information to make be more effective and helpful for me?</p>
</details>

我认为这只是第一阶段。我认为第二阶段，它将拥有博士级别的大脑，能够思考意想不到的场景，从未被思考过的事情，它能够推理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's just phase one. I think phase two, this thing's going to have a brain of a PhD where it can think of unintended scenarios, things that have never been thought about. It can reason.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为我们正走在一条非常有趣的人工智能道路上。我们正处于非常早期的阶段。它在两方面都有好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think we're on to a very interesting road with AI. We're in the very early stages. uh it has benefits on both sides.</p>
</details>

再一次，每一项技术都可以被不良行为者和良好行为者使用。希望良好行为者能胜过不良行为者，我们正在与人工智能合作，看看能否利用这些“大脑”成为更好的安全分析师，更快地解决安全问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once again, every piece of technology can be used by bad actors and good actors. Hopefully, the good actors outweigh the bad actors and we're working with AI to see if we can use those brains to become better security analysts, solve security problems faster.</p>
</details>

你们如何确保自己拥有比他们更多的计算能力和更好的算法等等？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you make sure that you have more compute than they have and better algorithms and so on.</p>
</details>

老实说，你不需要比不良行为者拥有更多的计算能力。如果不良行为者最终拥有更多的计算能力，那我们将面临一个真正的问题，因为如果他们拥有更多计算能力，世界将变得黑暗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, honestly, uh you don't need more compute than bad actors. the day the day bad actors end up with more comput we'll have a real problem because if they had more compute then the world is a dark place.</p>
</details>

但我认为，即使是现有的计算能力，也可以被有效利用。不幸的是，从不良行为者的角度来看，计算能力正被用于创造一个越来越快、越来越聪明的大脑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think even with the compute that's out there uh it can be leveraged effectively unfortunately from a bad actor perspective the compute is really being used for to create a faster and faster brain a smarter and smarter brain.</p>
</details>

一旦这个大脑存在，希望我们能找到技术和方法，将其部署在边缘设备上，比如你的手机，在许多不同的地方加以利用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once the brain exists hopefully we'll find technologies and techniques where they can be deployed at the edge on your phone in many different places to be able to leverage it.</p>
</details>

所以我认为真正的风险在于，这项技术在“黑暗面”被利用的可能性是无限的，就像它在“光明面”一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think the real risk risk is that uh there is infinite possibility for this technology to be used in in sort of the dark side as much as it can be on the right side.</p>
</details>

因此，我们必须确保在部署、启用和使其无处不在时，我们采取了正确的防护措施和控制系统。否则，我们将不得不面对，而且很难将“魔鬼”放回瓶子里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have to make sure as we deploy it as we enable it, as we make it more omnipresent, we do that with the right guard rails and the right control systems in place. Otherwise, we're going to have to go and it's very hard to put the genie back in the bottle.</p>
</details>

### 网络威胁的演变：从个人到国家级攻击

Nikesh，谁是那些“坏人”？“黑暗面”在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nash, who are the bad guys? Where is the dark side?</p>
</details>

“黑暗面”很有趣，它一直在演变。我认为15年前，那些“坏人”是坐在父母地下室里玩游戏的人，他们精通技术，通过入侵他人或证明一个观点来获得一种成就感，就像赢得一个奖杯一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the dark side is interesting. It's been an evolution. Uh I think 15 years ago, it was people who sat, you know, playing games in their parents' basements and who were great at technology and sort of uh hacking somebody or proving a point was a was kind of like getting a trophy.</p>
</details>

他们会说：“看，我多聪明，我能入侵系统X、系统Y，我证明了我能做到。”但很快，随着世界变得越来越互联，它开始有了经济上的驱动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like, you know, look, look at me. I'm so smart. I can hack into the system X, the system Y, and look, I showed that I can do it. But very quickly as the world became more and more interconnected it started getting an sort of economic legs.</p>
</details>

人们开始说：“等等，如果我这样做，我实际上可以找到一种方法来变现，并从中获取金钱，无论是从公司还是个人那里。”我们看到了很多这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People said wait if I do that I can actually find a way to monetize it and find a way of getting money for it whether from the companies or individuals.</p>
</details>

有很多勒索软件（**Ransomware**: 一种恶意软件，通过加密受害者文件并要求支付赎金来恢复访问）活动，很多活动是人们被恐吓，不得不与不良行为者分享经济利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're seeing a lot of that. There's a lot of ransomware activity a lot of activity where people are are scared into sharing economics with bad actors.</p>
</details>

我认为我们已经超越了那个阶段。我认为民族国家（**Nation States**: 指拥有主权和独立政府的国家）已经开始以一种强大的方式建立这种能力，因为我认为未来的战争将在数字战场和物理战场上同时进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're at we're past that too. I think nation states have started building that capability in a robust way because uh I think the future wars will be fought both in the digital war sort of battlefield as well as a physical battlefield.</p>
</details>

从伤亡角度来看，数字战场要便宜得多。如果你能更具体地谈谈国家，我认为某些国家拥有巨大的攻击能力并不是国家机密，即使是美国也拥有强大的攻击能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Digital battlefield is a lot less expensive from a from a you know situation where from a casualty perspective if you were a bit more specific about the countries look I don't think it's a state secret that there are countries which have tremendous offensive capability even the US has great offensive capability.</p>
</details>

但有些人花更多时间建立攻击能力而不是防御能力，因为他们觉得这种能力在对抗情境中会得到极好的利用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">But there are there are people out there who spend more time building offensive capability than defensive capability because they feel that that capability would be extremely well leveraged in a adversarial situation and you know we have bad actors we We've seen groups in North Korea.</p>
</details>

我们看到了朝鲜的团体，中国的团体，俄罗斯的团体，东欧的各个地区，中东的一些地区。所以，你有一些团体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've seen groups in China. You've seen groups in Russia, various parts of Eastern Europe, some parts of the Middle East.</p>
</details>

这并不意味着整个国家都是坏的。那里居住着一些人，因为他们可以获得资源，而且很难从信托角度对他们造成某种后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have you have groups of people. Now that doesn't mean the whole country is bad. There are people who are resident there because they have access to resources. They have there's hard to create sort of you know some consequence from a fiduciary perspective against those.</p>
</details>

所以他们就在那里。你们能通过他们的攻击方式识别他们吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's where they are. Could you recognize them by the way they attack?</p>
</details>

是的。那么，告诉我有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Uh so tell me what's the difference?</p>
</details>

好的，现在我坐在Palo Alto Networks，我们看到一些红灯在闪烁，我怎么能看出是俄罗斯人而不是朝鲜人？我怎么能看出来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, hey, so now I'm uh I'm uh sitting in uh in Polo Alto Networks. Uh we get some uh red lights flashing and uh how can I see that it's some Russian guys rather than some North Korean guys. What how do I how can I see that?</p>
</details>

嗯，有一些攻击技术带有“签名”。人们为自己的工作感到自豪，他们会在工作中嵌入签名。所以你可以识别签名。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there are attack techniques which have been have sort of signatures in there. People are proud of their work. They embed signatures in their work. So, you can recognize signatures.</p>
</details>

你可以识别出过去人们使用过的各种变体。你可以从使用的IP地址中获得一些线索。你可以看到流量来自哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can recognize that there are variants of things that people have used in the past. you can get some sense from the IP addresses that are being used. You can see where the traffic is coming from.</p>
</details>

所以你总能得到一些线索，但并不总是准确的，因为有办法规避这些。所以这是一种三角测量练习，介于使用的技术、使用的恶意软件、流量来源、流量规模和攻击规模之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you get some sense always not always accurate because there's ways to circumvent that. So it's a it's sort of a triangulation exercise between the technique used, the malware used, the where the traffic's coming from, the scale of the traffic, the scale of the attack.</p>
</details>

有时你会看到只有民族国家才拥有计算能力来实施的拒绝服务攻击（**DOS Attacks**: Denial-of-Service Attacks，通过使目标服务器或网络资源过载，从而阻止合法用户访问）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes you see DOS attacks which only nation states have the compute capability to go uh exercise.</p>
</details>

你总是可以从目标是谁、对手可能是谁来理解。你知道，当乌克兰战争开始时，乌克兰的系统受到攻击，很明显它们是被某些特定的人攻击的，对吧？你理解其中有动机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you can always understand from uh who the target is, who the adversary might be. You know, it was non it was pretty obvious when the Ukraine war started that the systems in Ukraine that were being attacked, they were being attacked by a certain set of people, right? That you understood there was motive.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，通过三角测量动机、恶意软件技术以及地址和位置，你可以得到一个相当不错的判断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think triangulating motive, malware techniques and and addresses and location gives you a reasonably good idea.</p>
</details>

攻击目标的类型正在改变吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is the type of targets changing?</p>
</details>

是的，它已经改变了。这是一个很好的问题。攻击目标的类型已经从个人转向单个公司，现在我们正处于供应链（**Supply Chain**: 供应链，指产品从原材料到最终消费者手中的整个过程）的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it has. Yes, that's a great question. the type of targets have migrated from individuals to individual companies and now we're in the world of supply chain and what I mean by that is you know if you want to go uh find out what an activist is doing in their email you try and attack the activist trying to get access to their username password so you can see what they're doing which would be a very targeted attack to whether it's an individual or a company but then he says then said look I'm going to need this capability for a very long time why don't I go attack the backbone of the email system.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，如果你想知道一个活动家在他们的电子邮件中做了什么，你会尝试攻击这个活动家，试图获取他们的用户名和密码，这样你就能看到他们在做什么。这是一种针对个人或公司的非常有针对性的攻击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I mean by that is you know if you want to go uh find out what an activist is doing in their email you try and attack the activist trying to get access to their username password so you can see what they're doing which would be a very targeted attack to whether it's an individual or a company.</p>
</details>

但后来他说：“看，我将长期需要这种能力，为什么我不去攻击电子邮件系统的骨干呢？”一旦我进入那里，我就可以查看任何人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then he says then said look I'm going to need this capability for a very long time why don't I go attack the backbone of the email system. So once I have end there, I can go look at anyone.</p>
</details>

或者，为什么不攻击一个被1万家公司部署的硬件呢？一旦我知道如何攻破一个，我就可以随意攻破其他9999个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or why don't attack a piece of hardware that is deployed by 10,000 companies once I know how to break into one, I can break into the other 9,999 at will.</p>
</details>

所以你开始看到越来越多的供应链攻击，这有效地让不良行为者能够随着时间的推移，扩大他们的目标范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're beginning to see a lot more supply chain attacks, which effectively allow bad actors to go amplify their their sort of, you know, targets over time where they want to go.</p>
</details>

这有点像我们在行业内开玩笑说的，有一些团体提供“勒索软件即服务”（**Ransomware as a Service**: 一种商业模式，勒索软件的开发者将其恶意软件出租给其他网络犯罪分子）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's kind of like we we joke about this in the industry. Uh it's kind of like you know there's groups that do ransomware as a service.</p>
</details>

他们会利用已知的漏洞，在成千上万的设备中驻留，并向那些出于金钱原因想要利用它的人提供这种能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They'll go become resident in tens of thousands of pieces of equipment based on known vulnerabilities and offer that capability to people who want to go uh exploit it uh for their own monetary reasons.</p>
</details>

这个行业有多少钱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much money in this industry?</p>
</details>

数十亿美元。不幸的是，它是最赚钱的行业之一，因为据上次统计，勒索软件和在线诈骗（这是另一种网络行为）之间有近180亿美元的资金流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean billions. Billions. Look, it's it's unfortunately one of the most profitable industries out there because I think by last count there was close to $18 billion uh between ransomware and scams, online scams, which are another form of cyber sort of behavior.</p>
</details>

挑战在于，Nikola，在这些案件中，起诉这些人非常困难，因为最终你的线索会止步于某个第三世界国家或某个遥远的国家，你没有能力跨越五个不同国家或多个大洲进行调查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the challenge, Nikolai, is that in each of these cases, it's very hard to prosecute people because eventually your your lead ends up in some third world country or in some other country which is very far away and you don't have the capability to go investigate all the way across five different nations or multiple continents.</p>
</details>

除非这些事情性质重大，否则很难起诉他们。对吧？如果有人让你将1万美元转账到非洲的一个银行账户，很难起诉并追回这笔钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very hard to go prosecute them unless these are things of significance in nature. Right? If somebody made you transfer $10,000 to a bank account in in Africa, it's very hard to prosecute that. and reverse that.</p>
</details>

现在，如果你受到勒索攻击，或者你将破坏关键基础设施，你将堵塞一条管道。是的，在这种情况下可以进行起诉，因为它不仅仅是金钱影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you are going to get ransom attacked or you're going to bring down critical infrastructure, you're going to block a pipeline. Yes, there is prosecution that can happen in that situation because it's bigger than just monetary impact.</p>
</details>

这是一种“天哪，有人试图在某个基础设施能力或某个公用事业能力中制造混乱”的情况。那时人们才会参与进来。但我认为，有很长的尾部效应，在这些情况下很难进行起诉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of oh my god, somebody's trying to, you know, so chaos in some infrastructure capability or some utility capability. That's when people do get engaged and get involved. But I think there's a very long tale where it's very hard to go prosecute these situations.</p>
</details>

为什么基础设施项目越来越多地受到攻击？我们看到水厂、电信网络、电网等都受到了攻击。为什么黑客会攻击这些东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why are um infrastructure projects increasingly under attacks? I mean we're seeing it in water plants, telco networks, power grids and so on. Why are the hackers going after these things?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为首先，这更容易，因为通常这些东西大部分都拥有相对老旧的基础设施，因为它们的工作是提供电力、水和能源等。它们有时在技术上不像你希望的那样先进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think it's uh first of all, it's easier because typically those things are, you know, they have relatively older infrastructure for the most part because their job is to provide electricity and provide water and power etc. They're not sometimes technologically as advanced as you'd like them to be.</p>
</details>

但我们还发现，尽管它们的基础设施老旧，为了易用性和便利性，我们正在安装一些“创可贴”系统，可以连接到这些东西。

所以，如果你能通过物联网（**IoT**: Internet of Things，物联网）或运营技术（**Operational Technology**: 运营技术，用于监控和控制物理过程的硬件和软件）连接电网的每个部分，远程管理电网会容易得多。

我认为另一方面，你可以寻找的是，我称之为“基本卫生”。你知道，通常网络安全就像水一样，它遵循阻力最小的路径。

<p class="english-text">I think on the flip side what you can look for is uh I say basic hygiene You know typically cyber security is like water it follows the path of least resistance.</p>

所以最脆弱的公司将面临最多的问题。因此，要求一定水平的质量，一定水平的网络安全“卫生”变得很重要。

但我并不担心。系统中有足够的细分，有足够的断路器，我认为今天我们说，当你考虑网络安全时，要考虑网络韧性（**Cyber Resilience**: 网络韧性，指组织在面对网络攻击、故障或变化时，能够持续提供预期服务的能力）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I I I'm not worried.

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now um compared to other uh sectors within technology the um cyber sub sector is uh is quite fragmented. Why is it not more consolidated?</p>
</details>

这是一个很好的问题，我认为，如果你看看技术，那是我们七年前的论点。当我来到这里时，我们的论点是，这是一个每年2000亿美元收入的行业，而我们只有1.5%的市场份额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a great question and I think uh if you look at technology uh that was our thesis 7 years ago uh when I came here our thesis was it's about a $200 billion revenue industry annually and we were at one and a half% market share.</p>
</details>

我们是市场上排名前三的参与者之一。所以，正如你所说，它分散在小公司中。我认为你可以追溯到，首先，记住网络安全是技术领域最新的子行业之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we were one of the top three players in the market. So that's that is like you said fragmented in the small and I think you can go back and trace it first of all remember cyber security is one of the newest subsectors of technology.</p>
</details>

对吧？1989年我上大学时，还没有“互联网连接”这种东西。所以这个行业不到30年历史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right in 1989 when I went to university there's nothing called internet connectivity right so this thing is less than 30 years old.</p>
</details>

真正的广泛连接是在过去20年才出现的，当时手机流行起来，人们开始在手机上使用应用程序，因为现在每家公司、每个企业都必须为你的银行账户或你选择的与公司或电子商务相关的活动敞开大门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And true widespread connectivity really came about for all consumers and mobile phones were sort of popular and people started using apps on their phones because now every company any enterprise had to open doors for your bank account or you pick your favorite activity with your company or e-commerce.

但我的观点是，这个行业子行业只有20年历史。是的。那时它才开始。所以它还没有时间真正整合到某种平台中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But my point is this this industry subsector is 20 years old. Yeah. That's when it started. So it hasn't had time to actually consolidate in some sort of platform.</p>

如果你看看工作流管理、客户关系管理（**CRM**: Customer Relationship Management，客户关系管理）或IT管理，这些东西已经存在了30、40或50年，你已经看到了平台化（**Platformization**: 平台化，指将多个独立产品或服务整合到一个统一平台上的战略）或我喜欢称之为将这种分散整合为更有意义的技术提供商。

</details>

我们的论点和赌注是，随着时间的推移，网络安全也将走上同样的道路。我们很幸运，现在我们占据了大约4%到5%的市场份额，产品市场份额可能达到8%，这比1.5%要好。

<p class="english-text">You can see at Google there were so many products when I worked there which had a zero zero monetization and possibly even today things like Google Maps or the Chrome browser.</p>

我建立了一些关于行业如何运作以及需要发生什么的论点。我的“尤里卡时刻”是，你知道，在Google工作过之后，我说，从技术角度来看，最重要的两件事是云计算（**Cloud**: Cloud Computing，云计算）和人工智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And my plastics moment was you know having been at Google I said look the two most important things from a technology perspective would be cloud and AI.</p>
</details>

这是我们在七年前说的，当时人工智能还不流行，云计算才刚刚开始流行。所以我们调整了公司方向，我们烧掉了我们的数据中心，我们没有数据中心，我们所有的东西都在公共云上运行。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This is something we said seven years ago when AI was not in fashion cloud was beginning to get into fashion and so we pivoted our company we burned down our data centers we don't have data centers we run everything in the public cloud.</p>
</details>

我们围绕云安全建立了一整套实践，我们使用机器学习（**Machine Learning**: 机器学习，人工智能的一个分支，使计算机系统能够从数据中学习并改进性能）构建了整个安全管理堆栈，这是七年前人工智能的通用名称。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh we built a whole practice around cloud security uh we built our entire security management stack using machine learning which was the the the normal name for AI at that point in time seven years ago.</p>

但我们花了七年时间才打造出了一款伟大的产品，我们很高兴，因为我们七年前做的一些投资现在正在开花结果，让我们能够像现在这样取得成功。

<p class="english-text">Now he acts as a technology consiliary both for our management team as well as our customers. So he'll go out meet customers talk about the security stack work with them as to what should be the greatest outcome for them.</p>

</details>

看，我前几天读到微软一位杰出人士的文章，他是在Internet Explorer的背景下说的。他说，你通常可以在一个转折点（**Tipping Point**: 转折点，指一个系统或情境发生根本性改变的关键时刻）变得普遍和显而易见之前三四年看到它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh look, uh I read something the other day from a distinguished person at Microsoft and uh he was saying it in the context of I think internet explorer. He said you can see a tipping point typically three or four years before it is going to become widespread and fundamentally obvious right.</p>
</details>

关键是，当你审视技术趋势时，你必须说：“我刚刚看到了什么？它将如何从根本上改变事物？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the key is when you look at technological trends you have to say what is it that I just saw and how's that going to fundamentally change things.</p>
</details>

所以，以人工智能为例，现在围绕人工智能有很多炒作，人们实际上坐在那里说：“天哪，这个人工智能将是惊人的。”你可以看到Nvidia，你可以看到基础设施，人们想花5000亿美元建造大型数据集群、数据中心。

</details>

问题是，洞察力是什么？它将做什么？现在，你可以看到它。很清楚。每个人都清楚，人工智能将发生一些事情，从现在起四到五年，一些事情将发生根本性的不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The question is, but what's the insight? What is that going to do? Now, you can see it. It's pretty clear. Everybody's clear that something's going to happen with AI and something's going to be fundamentally different four to five years from now.</p>

问题是，从现在起五到十年，它会多么激进？你必须坐下来定义你的原则。

<p class="english-text">The question is how radical is it going to be 5 to 10 years from now? You have to sit down and define your principles.</p>

比如，我从根本上相信产品开发将彻底颠覆。今天，你知道，50%的技术都部署在科技公司的产品开发中。你不需要做那么多，因为科技公司的产品开发就是我们设计一种与数据和机器对话的方式。这就是我们所做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I fundamentally believe product development will go flip on its head. Today, you know, 50% of technologies are deployed in product development across technology companies. you won't need to do it as much because product development in technology companies is us designing a way to talk to data and machines. That's what we do.</p>
</details>

产品开发人员说：“让我把所有这些都简化。”就像你在booking.com上预订机票一样。那个用户界面（**UI**: User Interface，用户界面）就叫做产品开发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Product development people say let me take all this make it simple. It's like you booking your airline ticket on booking.com. That UI is called product development.</p>
</details>

但是，如果我可以直接与它对话，说“帮我订一张票，帮我做这些事情”，这是一个非常简单的例子。无论是DoorDash还是Instacart，你都不需要从产品开发的视角构建所有这些惊人的用户界面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if I can just talk to it and say book me a ticket and do this stuff for me and this is a fundamentally easy example. Whether it's say Door Dash or Instacart, you don't need to build all this amazing UI that sits in front from a product development perspective.</p>
</details>

你可以开始与数据和机器对话，因为它们会像另一个人一样理解你，这就是你的互动方式。如果你相信这就是十年后的未来，那么一切都将发生根本性的改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can start talking to data and machines because they understand you as another human would and that's how your interaction becomes. If you believe that's the future 10 years from now, everything fundamentally changes.</p>
</details>

那么下一个问题是，你如何在这个未来中定位自己？你是否应该追逐诸如撰写更好的法律摘要或投资那些正在进行边际增量改进的公司，或者你是否应该从根本上重新思考这将如何影响技术？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then the next question is how do you position yourself in that future? Uh should you be chasing things like you know writing better legal briefs or you know and investing in companies which are making marginal incremental improvements or should be fundamentally rethinking how that's going to impact technology.</p>
</details>

我们必须思考，就像我们认为人工智能的未来将更具代理性（**Agentic**: 代理性，指系统或AI能够自主地感知环境、做出决策并采取行动）一样。我们正在思考，如果那个世界实现了，我们如何构建安全保护，以防止代理失控。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have to think right like we think their future of the future of AI is going to be more agentic in nature. We're sitting saying if that world transpires how do we build security protection where agents don't don't run a mock.</p>
</details>

所以我们正在努力在脑海中构建一个完整的代理幻想世界，然后我们必须说，我们如何保护那个幻想世界中的代理。所以我们有一个二阶导数问题，而不仅仅是一阶导数问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we're trying to build a whole fantasy world of agents in our head and then we have to say how do we protect that fancy world of agents. So we have we have like a second derivative problem not just first derative problem.</p>
</details>

那么，如果你将这种思维应用于科技行业，你现在应该把赌注押在哪里？

<p class="english-text">So if you apply this thinking to the technology sector, where should you place your bets now?</p>

任何依赖席位（**Seats**: 指软件许可或用户数量）、依赖人类以及人类使用更多软件的软件企业，都必须从根本上重新思考其战略，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Any software business that relies on seats, that relies on humans and humans using more software has to fundamentally rethink their strategy, right?</p>
</details>

因为如果你相信这波人工智能浪潮将成为现实，我们将变得更加高效，我们将在企业环境和创业环境中从根本上以不同的方式使用人类，你将用更少的人完成更多的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if you believe this wave of AI is going to be true, we're going to be much more efficient and we're going to be using humans fundamentally differently in the enterprise environment and the entrepreneurial environment and you'll get a lot more done with a lot less.</p>
</details>

如果这是真的，那么你必须关注“更多”会是什么，因为从人员角度来看，你将拥有“更少”。所以我认为重新思考这一点会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If that's true, then you have to focus on what the lot more is going to be because you're going to have a lot less from a people perspective. So I think rethinking that would be interesting.</p>

我认为会出现一些市场错位。我昨晚和某人聊天时谈到，通常市场一开始不会意识到，直到它受到冲击，但当它受到冲击时，它会过度地向相反方向摆动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there will be some market dislocations. I was chatting with somebody last night and we talked about look typically the market first doesn't realize uh until it gets hit but when it gets hit it swings too hard in the opposite direction.</p>
</details>

所以几年后，当市场开始看到这场“灾难”来临时，市场上会出现价值机会。短期内，市场并没有意识到随着时间的推移，这种趋势将获得更多动力，因为事情变得越来越高效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there'll be value opportunities in the market in a few years when market begins to see this uh catastrophe coming in the short term the market is not realizing that this thing is going to start taking more momentum over time as things get more and more efficient.</p>
</details>

所以我认为企业方面将对基于席位的业务进行重新思考，你可以看到所有这些业务都非常专注于人工智能，并用人工智能创造更多价值，并找出如何交付人工智能代理而不是人类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think there's going to be a rethinking on the enterprise side uh for seedbased based businesses and you can see all of them are very focused on AI and creating more value with AI and figuring out how to deliver AI agents instead of humans and that's kind of an smart thing and interesting thing.</p>

有些会成功，有些不会。我认为在消费者方面，我以前说过，我在这里再说一遍，我认为设备上应用程序的整个概念将不得不被重新思考。

从来没有更容易过。你只需要帮助人们克服他们的异议，克服他们的挑战，并说这对你来说是一个更好的结果。

<p class="english-text">It never was easier. You just have to work people through their objections and through their capabil through their challenges and say this is a much better outcome for you.</p>

<p class="english-text">Oh uh I grew up in India. I got an electrical engineering degree and um I wanted to go to business school and I applied to a few in the United States.</p>

那时去美国读商学院非常困难，因为有外汇管制。你无法真正支付学费。所以所有这些障碍，我们都克服了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh at that time it was very hard to get to the US for business school because there was foreign exchange regulations. You couldn't really pay. So all that stuff you know we we overcame those hurdles.</p>

我很荣幸能获得东北大学（**Northeastern University**: 位于美国波士顿的一所私立研究型大学）的一个名额，如果我教授计算机科学，他们就愿意支付我的学费。

当时这是一个非常新兴的领域，当时还没有。所以实际上1989年，我说是87、88年，印度才开始将计算机科学作为专业。我当时实际上是一名电气工程师，甚至不是计算机科学工程师。所以我花了一个夏天恶补计算机科学，这样我就可以来教它了。我就是这样来到东北大学读商学院的。

为什么印度裔首席执行官在科技领域如此成功？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why are Indian CEOs so successful in technology?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为存在选择偏差。我们正在看，你知道，我们占世界人口的16%。所以，这并不是一个糟糕的开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think there's a selection bias. We're looking at, you know, we're 16% of the world's population. So, that's not a bad start.</p>

但我想，如果你看看30年前，我们来到美国唯一的途径是，我们必须通过重要的教育障碍才能成功，比如如果你在你的领域没有出色的学术成就，你就不能获得美国的签证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but I think if you look 30 years ago the only way for us to be here in the US was we had to go through significant let's say educational hurdles to make it like you weren't allowed a visa in the United States if you weren't uh academically brilliant in your in your field.</p>
</details>

鉴于印度和这里之间的经济差距，我们很多人选择寻找更好的机会，然后来到了这里。所以你有一个庞大的全球培训的工程人才库可供选择。

<p class="english-text">And uh given the economic disparity between India and here a lot of us chose to look for greener pastures and we came here so you had a lot of large pool you have a large pool from a globally trained engineering population to choose from.</p>

我认为从那时起，就像达尔文主义一样，我们中的一些人不断地通过组织的各种层级，最终，你知道，印度人必须懂得如何编程，所以我们很多人都在科技领域。

<details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh I think uh I'd say even the technology sector really has grown tremendously in the last 30 years is where all the opportunity was so I think it's a it's a confluence of uh circumstances that allowed us all of us to be here.</p>
</details>

可能还有我们韧性、我们的，嗯，走工程和学术道路的一些特质。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's uh what's the Indian leadership style like what are the commonalities.</p>
</details>

看，我们都伴随着稀缺而成长。我认为，所以足智多谋对我们来说是天生的，因为如果我看看我行业中的一些朋友和同行，我了解他们中许多人的背景，我们都有相似的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look um remember we all grew up with scarcity I think uh so being resourceful has to come naturally to us because uh if I look at some of my friends and peers in the industry I know the backgrounds of many of them and we all share similar backgrounds.</p>
</details>

我们都曾在印度的某个工程学院学习。我们都来自中下层或中产阶级家庭。如果你放眼整个行业，我正在思考我们行业中我认识的八到十位现在是传奇首席执行官的人，他们都有相似的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We all went to some sort of engineering school in India. We all came from lower middle class or middle- class families. If you look across the board and I'm just thinking of eight or 10 of the people I know in our sector who are legendary CEOs right now, they all have similar backgrounds.</p>
</details>

所以我们都具有一定程度的足智多谋，一定程度的，你知道，也许是那种拼搏精神。它伴随着非常强烈的职业道德，因为如果你没有埋头苦干的能力，你就无法在一个拥有超过十亿人口的国家生存。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we all have some degree of resourcefulness, some degree of uh you know scrappiness perhaps that comes with it. uh it is a comes with a very strong work ethic because you can't survive in a country with one plus billion people at that point in time if you don't have the ability to put your head down and work hard.</p>
</details>

我上工程学院时，我认为有10万人参加了考试，而我们想去的五所学校只招收了2000人。所以你有2%的机会被录取。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh when I went to engineering school I think 100,000 people took the exam and chose 2,000 people to go to those five schools that we wanted to go to. So there's a 2% chance that you get in.</p>
</details>

所以要进入那里，不仅仅是靠运气。它需要大量的努力和奉献。我认为我们每个人都经历过这些。所以有职业道德，有足智多谋的一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to get there it was not just going to be pure luck. It was going to be a lot of hard work and dedications. I think every one of us went through that. So there's a work ethic, there's a resourcefulness aspect.</p>
</details>

我认为还有不断学习的一面。你知道，我们没有人像你说的，伴随着人工智能长大。我们没有人伴随着云计算长大，但不知何故我们都设法学会了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a constant learning aspect to it. You know, none of us grew up with AI like you said. None of us grew up with the cloud, but somehow we've all managed to learn it.</p>

我没有伴随着网络安全长大。我们都设法学会了它。所以那里存在一定程度的持续学习算法。

<p class="english-text">I didn't grow up with cyber security. We all managed to learn it. So there is some degree of a constant learning um sort of algorithm in there.</p>

你如何保持谦逊，嗯，在所有这些成功面前？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you stay humble um with all that success?</p>
</details>

哦，回家和家人在一起。他们会立刻让你回到现实。你知道，无论你在工作中多么成功，你仍然是家庭单位的一部分。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Oh uh go home to the family. They'll they'll set you right in a heartbeat. You know it doesn't matter how successful you're at work. you're still part of a family unit.</p>
</details>

我认为这始终如一，我认识一些我提到的这些人，以及他们的配偶，你知道，他们让我们脚踏实地，让我们专注于正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think I think it's consistent and I know some of these people I said and their spouses and you know they keep us grounded they keep us focused on the right things.</p>
</details>

我昨晚和某人聊天，你知道，我仍然和高中时的朋友出去玩，你知道，我做什么工作并不重要，他们大部分时间也不在乎我做什么工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I was chatting with somebody last night you know I still hang out with my friends I knew in high school you know it doesn't matter what I do for a living and they don't really care what I do for a living for the most part.</p>
</details>

所以你只需要回家，和家人朋友在一起，他们会让你脚踏实地。正如你所知，这并不总是，你知道，嗯，每天都充满玫瑰和爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you just go back stay with your family and your friends and they'll keep you grounded and as you know it's it's it's not not sort of you know um roses and and and and tons of love every day.</p>
</details>

成功需要大量的磨砺。需要大量的，你知道，回到“盐矿”（**Salt Mine**: 盐矿，比喻艰苦乏味的工作），并从第一性原理中找出问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's a lot of grinding that is required to be successful what you do. There's a lot of, you know, going back to the salt mine and and and sort of figuring out things from first principles.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这让你每天都保持谦逊，尤其是在企业世界中，你不断地向人们推销，或者告诉他们你错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think that keeps you keeps you humble uh on a day-to-day basis and especially with the enterprise world, you're constantly selling to people or telling you you're wrong.</p>

你认为人们低估了在你的行业中取得成功所需的条件吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think people underestimate what it takes to be successful in your business?</p>

我认为每个角色、每份工作，我总是试图说，你知道，没有可比性。你的挑战和我的挑战。这不是一场竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think uh every role, every job, and I always try and say that, you know, there's no comparison. your challenges and my challenges. It's not a competition.</p>

我们应对挑战的能力和享受成功的能力是不同的。我相信医生有他自己的一套挑战和成功的机会。我相信首席执行官也有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's our ability to cope with challenges and our ability to enjoy successes is different. And I'm sure a doctor has his own set of challenges and opportunities to succeed. And I'm sure a CEO has them.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这更多是人性，而不是你所做的事情。也许问题是，你如何应对它？你如何处理它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's more human than than what you do. Perhaps the question is how do you cope with it? How can you handle it?</p>
</details>

有些人比其他人更能应对。随着时间的推移，你会发现那些成功并被这些事情吸引的人，拥有能够在高压的首席执行官工作和，你知道，在不工作时保持清醒之间找到正确平衡的个性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some people can cope with it better than the others.

我可以说，在大流行病之前，我非常专注于学习行业，理解行业，为公司制定一个出色的战略，因为我们必须找到一种方法，不成为网络安全公司正常衰落的一部分。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'd say pre- pandemic I was very focused on learning the industry, understanding the industry, building a brilliant strategy for the company because we had to find a way of not becoming part of the normal decline of a cyber security company.</p>

<p class="english-text">What became important is how do you survive a global crisis of that proportion and I'd say I lucked into it. I met this person um who we brought in literally in the first month to come speak to us and our team.</p>

他说，你知道，你必须思考的根本问题不是你的网络安全战略是什么，而是与你一起工作的人们的心理状态。

在那时，他们只关心确定性和可预测性，而你作为领导者的工作就是创造这种确定性。你的工作不是谈论你将如何获胜，你的工作是创造那种“我被照顾着”的舒适感和确定性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">At that point in time all they care about is certainty and predictability and your job as a leader is to create that your job is not to talk about how you're going to win your job is to create that comfort and certainty that I am taking care of.</p>
