### 经济学家的视角：泰勒法则与货币政策的演变

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Okay. I never talk about the Nobel Prize in economics. It's like bad luck. And I'm not doing that with somebody qualified to get the call from Scandinavia."

我从不谈论诺贝尔经济学奖。这有点像不吉利，而我现在也不能对那些有资格接到斯堪的纳维亚电话的人（指诺贝尔奖得主）这样做。

"But I want to go back. This is really important. Richard Clar there can be like in 1980 I've had the honor of talking to Joe Stiglets about Grossman Stiglets which in 1980 I'm kid not kidding folks it was like a four-page paper it was small it was focused and then with you and you know I don't want to get into you know this or that there's Clarita G um Geler and Galdi okay up at Brown University when you make a paper like that that is treasured by this is on DSG folks it's treasured by all of economics how do you get that paper done that ends up being like hey should they win a Nobel Prize what was the process of doing you know name the paper but I'll go clar Geler the science of monetary policy is just one example"

但我想回到过去。这真的很重要。理查德·克拉（Richard Clar）在1980年，我有幸与约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨（Joe Stiglitz）谈论格罗斯曼-斯蒂格利茨（Grossman-Stiglitz）的研究，那是在1980年，我没开玩笑，各位，那只是一篇四页的论文，篇幅很小，很集中。然后，和你在一起，你知道，我不想深入探讨这个或那个，有克拉丽塔·G·格勒（Clarita G. Geler）和加尔迪（Galdi），在布朗大学。当你写出这样一篇被经济学界珍视的论文时，它被经济学界所珍视。你是如何完成这篇论文的，最终变成了“嘿，他们应该获得诺贝尔奖”？这其中的过程是怎样的？请说出论文的名字，但我会引用克拉·格勒（Clar Geler）的“货币政策的科学”，这只是一个例子。

"Well, it was an interesting time because uh the authors, Mark Girtler, Jordy Galley and I were were sort of uh either early or or or late, but we felt there was a a vacuum in academic economics in that it treated monetary policy as a black box. And we thought these guys are trying to do something sensible. So, we actually worked out essentially a forward-looking tailor rule to describe actual monetary policy. And it turned out that it actually did a good job and it made a lot more sense than the black box. But when we wrote that paper, I don't think we had any idea that it would have the impact that it would. We thought it could get ignored."

那是一个有趣的时期，因为作者马克·格特勒（Mark Girtler）、乔迪·加利（Jordy Galley）和我，要么是早了，要么是晚了，但我们觉得学术经济学存在一个真空，它将货币政策视为一个黑箱。我们认为这些人正试图做一些有意义的事情。所以，我们实际上设计了一个前瞻性的泰勒法则来描述实际的货币政策。结果证明，它确实做得很好，而且比黑箱模型更有意义。但当我们写那篇论文时，我并不认为我们会想到它会产生如此大的影响，我们觉得它可能会被忽视。

"Okay. away from you in a modern economics there's a 19th century what's called plug and chug which is you have an equation folks and you fill in the little blanks of the algebraic equation the Taylor rule you can't do that cuz you don't know where the output gap is right now is Jerome Powell flying blind uh well he he's certainly uh flying uh with an obscured uh vision uh out the cockpit uh for sure and I think there's always some uncertainty about things like what is our star or what's the full natural rate of unemployment? But it's probably elevated uh now and the stakes, let's be honest. I guess let me cut to the punchline. The stakes are higher now because of the fact that for the last four years inflation's been above target. And of course in 2021 and 2022 it surged and was not transitory. And so I would argue the stakes are higher now for the Fed than they have been really going back to Paul Vulkar uh 40 years ago."

好了，我们换个话题。在现代经济学中，有一种19世纪的“填空题”模式，即你有一个方程，各位，然后你填入代数方程中的小空，就像泰勒法则一样。你做不到这一点，因为你不知道现在的产出缺口在哪里。杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）现在是在盲飞吗？嗯，他当然是在“飞行”，但视野确实被遮挡了，这一点是肯定的。而且我认为，关于“我们的星辰”（our star，可能指潜在产出）或者“充分就业的自然失业率”这类事情，总存在一些不确定性。但现在可能已经很高了。我们得说实话，让我直奔主题吧。现在的风险更高，因为过去四年通胀一直高于目标。当然，在2021年和2022年，通胀飙升并且并非暂时性。因此，我认为现在美联储面临的风险比40年前保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker）时期还要高。

### 政府停摆对美联储政策的影响

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Does the government shutdown impact the Fed's ability to manage its mandate here in terms of managing interest rates?"

政府停摆是否会影响美联储在此方面管理其任务的能力，即管理利率？

"The longer it goes on, the more that becomes a factor uh in particular because a lot of the data comes from the government including you know inflation data and the labor market uh data. Now the Fed like many other organizations and and in the private sector looks at a wide range of high frequency data. you get ADP, you get a lot of different indicators of the labor uh market. But yes, the longer this goes on uh the more challenging it is to determine exactly where the economy is."

它持续的时间越长，就越成为一个因素，特别是因为很多数据都来自政府，包括通胀数据和劳动力市场数据。现在，美联储和其他许多组织以及私营部门一样，会关注广泛的高频数据。例如，有ADP（美国自动数据处理公司）的数据，还有许多不同的劳动力市场指标。但是，是的，这种情况持续得越久，就越难准确判断经济的走向。

### 美联储面临的双重风险：就业与通胀

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"What do you think is the bigger risk for this economy? Is it from the Fed's perspective? Is it the labor market? Is it inflation? Are they evenly balanced here? What do you think the bigger risk is?"

你认为对这个经济体来说，更大的风险是什么？从美联储的角度来看，是劳动力市场还是通胀？它们是否在此处于平衡状态？你认为更大的风险是什么？

"Well, that was what was important about the September meeting because up until September, uh, JPAL and many on the committee had said, "Look, we have dual mandate employment and inflation and they seem to be roughly imbalance." And at the September meeting, they said, "We're now more concerned about the balance of risk in the labor uh market, and I respect that. But the reality is inflation now, using the Fed's preferred measure, is 2.9%. That's where it was 18 months ago. It's well above two. Um and so there is a risk to both sides. There's a risk if you don't cut rates the unemployment rate goes up a lot. There is a risk that if you do cut rates a year from now inflation stuck in the threes."

嗯，这就是9月份会议的重要性所在，因为在9月份之前，JP Morgan（可能是指鲍威尔）和委员会的许多成员都曾说过：“看，我们有双重使命：就业和通胀，它们似乎大致处于平衡状态。”而在9月份的会议上，他们表示：“我们现在更担心的是劳动力市场的风险平衡。”我对此表示尊重。但现实是，根据美联储偏好的衡量标准，目前的通胀率为2.9%。这和18个月前一样。它远高于2%。因此，两方面都存在风险。如果你不降息，失业率可能会大幅上升。如果你降息，一年后通胀可能会停留在3%的区间。

### AI驱动的生产力增长与潜在的经济颠覆

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Well, I I I think you're 100% uh right. You know, the term in economics um you know, is is it labor augmenting technical change? And I think the answer is yes, but more labor is augmented and other labor over time may be substituted for. And I think that is really the potential disruption from AI is not only does it lift output per hour, but it also could result in at some point in some displacement as as as well. So I think it's too soon to tell, but the minimum we know it's not evenly distributed."

我百分之百同意你的观点。在经济学中，我们称之为“劳动力增强的技术变革”，我认为答案是肯定的。但它增强了部分劳动力，而随着时间的推移，可能也会替代另一部分劳动力。我认为这才是AI真正潜在的颠覆性之处，它不仅能提高每小时产出，还可能在某个时候导致一些劳动力被取代。所以，现在下结论还为时过早，但我们至少知道的是，这种影响并非均匀分布。

### AI投资驱动的经济新格局：资本支出与旧经济的融合

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Well, the interesting point is, you remember a couple decades ago, uh, the talk in the US was about the weightless economy that we could get all this GDP without bricks and mortar. And it turns out that at least for this part of the new economy, you need a lot of bricks, a lot of mortar, a lot of servers, and a lot of power generation. So, in some ways to get to the very new economy, you real you need old economy capital spending."

有趣的一点是，你记得几十年前，在美国，人们谈论的是“无形经济”，即我们可以在没有实体建筑的情况下获得所有GDP。事实证明，至少对于新经济的这个部分来说，你需要大量的实体建筑、大量的服务器以及大量的电力供应。所以，在某种程度上，要实现真正的新经济，你需要旧经济的资本支出。

"And that's that's a pretty interesting period to be in. We think it's going to go on for 5 10 years, but it's a different economy than we we're used to thinking about in the last 20 years. You strip out the AI spend. A lot of folks will tell you this economy is not that strong. The capital spending is not that uh good."

这是一个非常有趣的时期。我们认为这种趋势将持续5到10年，但它与我们过去20年习惯思考的经济模式是不同的。如果你剔除AI的支出，很多人会告诉你，现在的经济并不那么强劲，资本支出也并不那么好。

"Arithmetically, that's correct. You know, in the first half of the year, GDP growth was about 1.6 1.7. If you if you strip out tech investment, then it was somewhere between zero and half of of that. you have to adjust for imports, but but clearly in the first half of the year, it's really been an AIdriven uh capex economy."

算术上来说，这是正确的。今年上半年，GDP增长约为1.6%-1.7%。如果你剔除科技投资，那么增长率就在0%到0.5%之间。你还需要根据进口进行调整，但很明显，今年上半年，经济增长确实是由AI驱动的资本支出所拉动的。

### 关税的影响：韧性、吸收与价格调整

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"So, one of the issues out there that I guess has gotten pushed to the background a little bit, maybe just because of fatigue, is tariffs and the impact on the economy. We have not necessarily seen meaningful inflation resulting from the tariffs. Um growth seems to be kind of hanging in every strong GDP print a few weeks ago. Um how do you think tariffs will impact the economy if at all?"

那么，目前存在的一个问题，可能因为疲劳而被稍微推到了背景，那就是关税及其对经济的影响。我们尚未看到因关税而导致的明显通胀。经济增长似乎还算稳健，几周前公布的GDP数据也很强劲。你认为关税会对经济产生什么影响，如果有的话？

"The economy has been uh refreshingly um and and surprisingly uh resilient. Um I don't think there's any doubt about that. Certainly at PIMCO we've revised up our uh outlook. You know, Atlanta Fed is now saying Q3 could come in at north of three%. So I actually think it actually in part is because of at the same time we've had the tariff uh hit to the economy, we've also had a justifiable optimism about about tech and and capital spending. So that that's been an important feature. I think the other important feature uh is that um you know, some of the tariffs have been absorbed either by the profits of US companies that had a lot of profits to absorb or foreign uh exporters. And then the third piece is we're probably not yet at the at the end point of of tariffs. They will continue to show up in the inflation data at least for um a while. But I think increasingly I and the Fed are of the view and that the Fed's what's important that this is really not going to be an inflationary story. It's a price level adjustment that we're sort of in the middle innings of getting through."

经济一直表现得令人耳目一新，而且出人意料地具有韧性。我认为这一点毋庸置疑。当然，在PIMCO，我们已经上调了我们的展望。你知道，亚特兰大联储现在预计第三季度的GDP增长可能超过3%。所以我其实认为，这在一定程度上是因为，与此同时，我们既受到了关税对经济的冲击，也对科技和资本支出抱有合理的乐观情绪。所以这是一个重要的特征。我认为另一个重要特征是，你知道，一些关税已经被吸收了，要么是美国公司利润丰厚，足以吸收这些关税，要么是外国出口商吸收了。第三点是，我们可能还没有达到关税的终点。至少在一段时间内，它们仍将体现在通胀数据中。但我认为，我以及美联储的观点越来越一致，重要的是，这真的不会成为一个通胀故事，而是一个我们正在经历中的价格水平调整。

### 日本经济的挑战：疲软的日元与通胀压力

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Explain to America what Xavier Salah Martin or Robert Mandel the Giant would say about how screwed up, messed up Japan is with weak yen log convex interest rates moving higher. The real rage chart published out of Tokyo today by Bloomberg is grim. Explain why our listeners and viewers should care about the fragility of Japan."

向美国人解释一下，泽维尔·萨拉·马丁（Xavier Salah Martin）或罗伯特·曼德尔（Robert Mandel）这位巨人会怎么说日本的混乱状况，以及日元疲软、对数凸性利率走高。彭博社今天公布的东京真实愤怒图表（real rage chart）令人沮丧。解释一下为什么我们的听众和观众应该关心日本的脆弱性。

"Well, because Japan is obviously a major economy, but it's also an even bigger part of, you know, international financial system with the yen an important currency, especially in riskoff episodes. Somebody has to hold all the JGBs that the government has been uh issuing. And so what happens in Japan also spills over into US uh capital markets and the global economy. And I think what's important for the listeners to understand now is that markets and investors have had sort of a rule of thumb about Japan which is it sort of goes off on its own. It's got deflation. Eventually they'll figure out their fiscal situation. And now Japan has broken out of deflation. They now have inflation. They have positive interest rates. and they're now very much a player in the global financial system."

因为日本显然是一个主要经济体，而且它在国际金融体系中占有更重要的地位，日元是一种重要的货币，尤其是在风险规避的情况下。有人必须持有政府一直在发行的所有日本国债。因此，日本发生的事情也会波及到美国的资本市场和全球经济。我认为听众现在需要理解的是，市场和投资者对日本有一个不成文的规定，那就是它似乎总是独立发展。它曾经面临通货紧缩。最终他们会解决财政问题。而现在，日本已经摆脱了通货紧缩。他们现在有了通胀，有了正利率，并且已经成为全球金融体系中一个重要的参与者。

"Is there but is there any precedent for a successful reflation? I don't see it in the literature. It's original to Japan, isn't it?"

但成功的再通胀是否有先例？我没有在文献中看到过。这在日本是独一无二的，不是吗？

"Well, Japan was went through about a two decade period where they had deflation. Now, it wasn't a spiral, but prices were negative. I think to me, Tom, one of the interesting things about Japan is although the BOJ was trying to reflate the economy, the politicians in the public actually didn't get a vote. They actually like deflation. You know, if you've got you've got your savings in yen under the mattress, you know, deflation is is good for you. So, I think a challenge right now in Japan is they finally after 25 years achieve the positive 2 or 3% inflation, but it's creating substantial political tension as well."

日本经历了大约二十年的通货紧缩。当然，那不是螺旋式下降，但物价是负的。对我来说，汤姆，日本有趣的一点是，尽管日本央行试图刺激经济，但政治家和公众实际上并没有投票权。他们实际上喜欢通货紧缩。你知道，如果你把日元储蓄藏在床垫下，那么通货紧缩对你是有利的。所以，我认为日本目前面临的挑战是，经过25年后，他们终于实现了2%或3%的正通胀，但这同时也造成了巨大的政治紧张。

### Z世代的价值观与职场挑战：一项开创性研究

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"My essay of the year is on the generational divide that we live every single day. Paul's limited. I'm living. Tucker, do you have offspring? Yeah. Okay. Off as well. Joining us now with my essay of the year. This was out of the Wall Street Journal uh a number of days ago and she's made a huge splash with it is Professor Susie Welch of NYU. Is Gen Z unemployable? It has created a firestorm of comment and I have to go to this because the last time Susie I think I saw you was with a guy named Jack Welch. When did you decide to go into the dark cavern of academics at NYU? What was the path? You didn't have to do this?"

我今年的最佳文章是关于我们每天都经历的代际鸿沟。保罗的（生活）有限。我的（生活）也有限。塔克，你有孩子吗？是的。好的。也有孩子。现在加入我们的是我今年的最佳文章。这几天发表在《华尔街日报》上，引起了巨大轰动，她是纽约大学的苏茜·韦尔奇（Susie Welch）教授。《Z世代是否无法就业？》这篇文章引起了轩然大波。我必须谈谈这个，因为上次我见到苏茜，我记得是和杰克·韦尔奇（Jack Welch）在一起。你是什么时候决定进入纽约大学学术界这个黑暗洞穴的？你的道路是什么？你本来不必这样做的。

"Yes, I'm proud to say that it is. I mean, it was conducted by myself and my team, which includes all the usual suspects of psychometricians and data analysts and so forth. So, we the research I think is um I'm really proud of it. It's rock solid. 40,000 people, 7,000 plus Gen Z types."

是的，我很自豪地说，它是。我的意思是，这是由我和我的团队进行的，其中包括了所有通常的心理测量学家和数据分析师等人员。所以，我认为这项研究……我对此非常自豪。它非常扎实。涉及40,000人，其中7,000多人是Z世代。

"Well, there's a bunch of, you know, look, I teach Gen Z every single day. I mean, every semester I hundreds of students. So, my shock was perhaps less than the rest of the team because I'm in the room with them. Now, NYU students are not quite um as uh representative of Gen Z as outside of NYU. These are MBA, so they tend to have a little bit more gr. Um uh I think that when we saw the 2% number which uh we can get to um we were all like we we checked it about 35 times because we thought that is much find that number get to that."

好吧，有很多原因……你看，我每天都教Z世代。我的意思是，每个学期我都有几百名学生。所以，我的震惊可能不如团队里的其他人那么大，因为我每天都和他们在一起。当然，纽约大学的学生并不能完全代表Z世代，尤其是在纽约大学之外。他们是MBA学生，所以他们往往更有毅力。我想当我们看到那个2%的数字时，我们都像……我们检查了大约35次，因为我们觉得那个数字太不可思议了，一定要弄清楚。

"So what we did is, we have a tool called the values bridge, which we developed in the uh in our labs and what it does is it ranks your values from 1 to 16 your personal values from 1 to 16. Um and so we um now 75,000 people have taken this test but at the time we did the research it was 45,000 people and we were able to cut it by generation and we were able to see Gen Z's values ranked from 1 to 16 and their number one value is something we call udemonia which is encompasses self-care recreation leisure funemployment you know just sounds like John Tucker Paul I think we all know somebody udimonia is their number one value number two was authentic self-expression voice as we call it and number three was um the desire to organize their life around helping other people, which is very admirable, I would say. Um, but after I saw those top three values, I thought, I wonder what hiring managers are looking for because my students are going out into the world to get hired. I have four adult children uh who are fighting out there in the world every day. So we did a separate uh study and we replicated it twice um after that um to uh to say okay um here are the definitions of all the values hiring managers in in knowledge industries mainly business it was tech it was uh it was accounting finance and so forth the consulting what values are you looking for and lo and behold they were looking for the number one value of achievement the desire to have success that other people can see number two was a desire for learning stimulation and growth and the third value was work centrism the desire to work um hard and uh when you cross uh reference those two data sets, it ends up that um it's just 2% of Gen Z that have the values that uh hiring managers are looking for."

所以我们做的是，我们有一个叫做“价值观桥梁”（values bridge）的工具，这是我们在实验室开发的，它可以对你的价值观进行1到16的排名，你的个人价值观从1到16。现在有75,000人参加了这个测试，但在我们进行研究时是45,000人，我们可以按代际进行细分，可以看到Z世代的价值观排名从1到16。他们的第一价值观是我们称之为“eudaimonia”的，它包括自我关怀、娱乐、休闲、有趣的就业……你知道，这听起来就像约翰·塔克（John Tucker），保罗，我想我们都认识这样的人，“eudaimonia”是他们的第一价值观。第二是“真实的自我表达”（authentic self-expression），我们称之为“声音”。第三是……渴望围绕帮助他人来组织生活，这是非常值得称赞的。但是，在我看到这前三项价值观之后，我想，不知道招聘经理们在寻找什么？因为我的学生们正走向社会去寻找工作。我有四个成年子女，他们每天都在这个世界上奋斗。所以我们做了另一项独立研究，并重复了两次，然后说，好了，这里是所有价值观的定义。招聘经理在知识型产业（主要是商业、科技、会计、金融、咨询等）中寻找哪些价值观？结果令我们大吃一惊，他们寻找的第一价值观是“成就”（achievement），即渴望获得其他人可以看到的成功。第二是渴望学习、获得刺激和成长。第三个价值观是“工作中心主义”（work centrism），即努力工作的渴望。当你交叉引用这两组数据时，结果是，只有2%的Z世代拥有招聘经理正在寻找的价值观。

"Yeah. I think they don't want to buy into a deal that their parents bought into that didn't work out for a lot of their parents. I mean, you can you can come up with a hundred reasons why they have these values and they're entitled to them. I think that the problem is values have consequences and so some of them also have affluence as a top value and then they are very frustrated and and frustrated to the point of kind of anger that they don't get to have uh affluence also as an output if you have the value self-care number one so they can have their val I don't you know how they came by their values I get it there's a million reasons I mean their parents might be to blame I mean with the torrent of letters that came to the letters to the editor after the article ran a lot of people had a lot of people they wanted to blame for this phenomenon"

是的。我认为他们不想接受他们父母曾经接受但最终并未奏效的交易。我的意思是，你可以找出100个理由来解释他们为什么持有这些价值观，而且他们有权持有。我认为问题在于，价值观是有后果的。所以，他们中的一些人还将“富裕”作为首要价值观，然后他们非常沮丧，沮丧到愤怒的地步，因为他们无法同时拥有“富裕”作为结果，如果他们的首要价值观是“自我关怀”，这样他们就能拥有他们的……我不知道他们是如何获得这些价值观的，我理解，有无数的原因，他们的父母可能也要负责。我的意思是，文章发表后，收到的读者来信雪片般飞来，很多人都想为这种现象找个替罪羊。

### 企业应对Z世代价值观的策略：争夺与适应

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"This is the million-dollar question. So, I've talked to a lot of business leaders since the piece came out. And so, the companies with brand equity who can go higher, the 2% are out looking for them earlier. And they, one executive said to me, 'This is a cage match. We're willing to fight.' All right. They're going to go find that 2%. They're going to go get them earlier and they're going to lock them down. And then uh other companies are going to have to figure out what to do about the fact that they're not going to be hiring young people who share their company values and do they accommodate them or do they try to slowly move them over to a different way of thinking. It's very hard to talk people out of their values."

这是价值百万美元的问题。这篇文章出来后，我与许多企业领导者进行了交谈。那些拥有品牌价值、能够提供更高平台的公司，会更早地去寻找那2%的人才。一位高管告诉我：“这是一场笼斗，我们愿意去争夺。”好的。他们会找到那2%。他们会更早地争取到他们，并把他们牢牢留住。而其他公司则不得不弄清楚如何应对这样一个事实：他们将无法招聘到认同公司价值观的年轻人，那么他们是迁就他们，还是试图慢慢地让他们转向另一种思维方式？非常难让人改变价值观。

"However, what do you find in the NBA program? Because you said um those people kind of self- select. they've we they want to achieve presumably, but again, I would suspect you see some of that in your classroom."

但是，你在MBA项目中发现什么？因为你说，那些人似乎会自我选择。他们希望取得成就，我想，但同样，我怀疑你在课堂上也能看到一些这种情况。

"I mean, I see a preponderance of udeonia, self-care being a top value. I do have MBAs, okay? And so, um, and in particular, the MBAs who are majoring in finance, those they have a lot of the values that companies are looking for, and they're picked off pretty early. Um, but I don't think this is true in colleges in general, and I think there's a few, and this is what I mean, is that companies are going to figure out where the 2% are, and they're going to come get them, and they're going to get them early. So, how about for these these kids though? I mean, do they do they recognize that maybe they are in fact different from certain maybe their parents and maybe their grandparents and others and they they're defiant and they're okay with that?"

我的意思是，我看到“eudaimonia”（自我关怀）是首要价值观的比例很高。我的确有MBA学生，好吗？所以，特别是那些主修金融的MBA学生，他们拥有许多公司正在寻找的价值观，而且他们被很早就挖走了。但是，我认为这在大学里并不普遍。而且我认为有少数人……这就是我的意思，公司将找出那2%的人在哪里，然后去争取他们，并尽早争取。那么，这些孩子呢？他们是否认识到，他们可能确实与他们的父母、祖父母以及其他人不同，而且他们是桀骜不驯的，并且对此感到满意？

"No, they're defiant. I mean, they're not just okay. Uh they're they're they're defiant. They're like you I mean what the letters from Gen Z that I got, the emails were like, 'Hey, shut up over there, lady, because um you ruined the world. You boomer people ruined the world.' And our response is this. And why would we want your values? Look what you did to us with climate change and terrorism and school shootings. You created this world. Why would we buy your version of events?"

不，他们是桀骜不驯的。我的意思是，他们不仅仅是满意。他们是桀骜不驯的。他们就像你一样。我的意思是，我收到的Z世代的来信，邮件中写着：“嘿，那边闭嘴吧，女士，因为你们毁了世界。你们这些婴儿潮一代毁了世界。”而我们的回应是这个。为什么我们要接受你们的价值观？看看你们给我们带来了什么——气候变化、恐怖主义、校园枪击。是你们创造了这个世界。为什么我们要接受你们的叙事？

### 价值观的根源与变化：代际差异的成因

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"Values generally don't change. Okay. All right. Values are generally set by the time we're 25 years old because a lot of things go into that stew. What changes is how much we express them or repress them. So I think what will happen is Jenzie will keep these values because unless you have a seismic event, your values generally stay the same your whole life. Um the seismic event may be not getting a job and then therefore they'll repress certain values or there they'll suppress them not happily."

价值观通常不会改变。好吧。价值观通常在我们25岁时就基本定型了，因为很多因素都会进入这个“大杂烩”。改变的是我们表达或压抑这些价值观的程度。所以，我认为将会发生的是，Z世代会保留这些价值观，因为除非发生某种剧变，否则你的价值观通常会伴随你一生。这种剧变可能是找不到工作，然后他们就会压抑某些价值观，或者他们会不情愿地抑制它们。

"Are you do you see that as again you're the one of the top NBA programs in the world here? Um my first sponsor first people to step up. My my point is half of Global Wall Street came out of the Stern program. They're everywhere. Absolutely true. Absolutely true. Um I mean, has the student body changed there, do you think? Um uh and my students who I don't want to make generalizations, but my students who are first generation generally are in that 2%. So they're not changing anything. They're like they've got their parents' values and they're there to win and they are uh clearly already there. I don't see the change yet. Right now I just see uh shock, you know."

你认为会这样吗？再次强调，你是世界上顶尖的MBA项目之一。我的第一个赞助商，第一个支持者。我的观点是，全球华尔街有一半人都出自斯特恩项目，他们无处不在。绝对正确。绝对正确。你认为那里的学生群体有变化吗？我的学生中，我不做笼统的概括，但我的第一代学生通常属于那2%。所以他们没有改变任何东西。他们拥有他们父母的价值观，他们来这里是为了赢，而且他们显然已经做到了。我还没看到变化。目前我只看到了震惊。

### AI时代下的教育与未来：对Z世代的挑战与机遇

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

这是否是净积极影响？比如，你班里的孩子们是否觉得这是一件净积极的事情？AI可能充斥着你与学生打交道的日常问题。从长远来看，科技是净积极还是净消极？

"This is I I don't know the answer. Sometimes I think it's a real net negative and in what it's done to how much we talk to each other.

我不知道答案。有时我觉得它是一个真正的净负面影响，在于它对我们彼此交流的方式造成的影响。但我要说的是，我的学生们因为AI而感到恐惧，比如AI正在抢走他们本可以做的工作。AI……你知道，一个一年级的顾问或分析师，他们就像受惊的鹿一样，想着“还有什么工作留给我们？我们的切入点在哪里？”这就是为什么……这就是为什么科技令人恐惧。现在，至于在家庭作业中使用AI，那是完全不同的……

"What is your experience? What do you what do you see? Uh when it first came out they were using it a lot and then as teachers we got very savvy about how to phrase the homework you know from your personal experience. Um and then I look at my students I say, you know, it's against the rules to use this on exams and I'm asking you personally for reasons of integrity do not use AI and generally they"

你的经历是什么？你看到了什么？它刚出现时，他们用得很多，然后作为老师，我们变得非常精明，知道如何措辞家庭作业，你知道，从你的个人经验来看。然后我看着我的学生说：“你知道，考试时使用它是违反规则的，我个人请求你们，出于诚信，不要使用AI。”一般来说，他们……

"Um that's a good point. I think that AI does the thinking for them with the cliffnotes usually you would then go into a classroom and you would be forced to discuss issues, but AI, right, you know, does the thinking and the talking. Explain to me what I also see particularly when I'm giving speeches between the American Gen Z. Yeah. And the hungry for is a stereotype. The hungry for kids, recent immigrants second. They're not buying the Gen Z thing. They're focused and they're killing it in differential equations. It's stern."

我认为AI替他们思考了。而精读笔记通常需要你进入课堂，被迫讨论问题，但AI，你看，它替你思考和说话。向我解释一下，尤其是我在做演讲时，我看到的美国Z世代。是的。以及……“渴望者”是一个刻板印象。那些“渴望者”的孩子，近期移民的第二代，他们不认同Z世代的说法。他们专注，他们在微分方程方面做得非常出色。这是斯特恩（商学院）。

"All right. So, this is what I want to say to that. Um and I want to wait till the data comes in but we are currently running the exact same study in three different places. one with first generation immigrants as part of the Gen Z and then we are uh attempting in a collaboration with a different school um to do it for this exact study in India and I don't know if we'll be able to do it but in China and I think that has uh implications for American competitiveness because if it comes back then in India uh 82% of Gen Z has uh hiring managers um values right"

好了，这就是我想说的。我将等待数据出来，但我们目前正在三个不同的地方进行完全相同的研究。一个是在Z世代中，研究第一代移民。然后，我们正在与其他学校合作，尝试在印度进行这项确切的研究。我不知道我们是否能做到，但在中国。我认为这对美国的竞争力有影响，因为如果数据显示，在印度，82%的Z世代拥有招聘经理所看重的价值观，那……

"Well, I think that uh they can't do what they would need to do, which is promise long-term employment. I mean, people feel loyal when they feel like, okay, I'm investing my time in a company and I'm going to be here in two or three years and my boss is going to be here. Full disclosure, Bloomberg LP every day. It's a privilege. I mean, that's where we come from, the three of us in this room, right? Well, you got probably a sense that look, this company is healthy and it's thriving and we're all going to be here and I'm willing to give myself to this organization and to work the extra hours because we're all going to be here together. And but for most people going into organizations, there's this constant sense of fragility and we may not be here. I could be gone tomorrow. Why would you invest in yourself in that? And so that contract is pretty much over."

我认为他们无法做到他们需要做的事情，那就是承诺长期就业。我的意思是，当人们感到“好吧，我正在投入时间和精力在一家公司，我将在两三年后在这里工作，我的老板也将在这里”时，他们才会感到忠诚。完全披露一下，彭博社LP（彭博有限合伙公司）的每一天，都是一种荣幸。我的意思是，我们三个人都来自那里，对吧？你可能会感觉到，看，这家公司很健康，它蓬勃发展，我们都将留在这里，我愿意为这个组织奉献自己，并加班加点工作，因为我们将一起在这里。但对于大多数进入组织的人来说，总有一种不安全感，我们可能不在这里。我明天就可能走了。你为什么要在这种情况下投资自己呢？所以，那种契约基本上已经结束了。

### Z世代的未来：价值观的坚守与演变

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.

"No, they're defiant. I mean, they're not just okay. Uh they're they're they're defiant. They're like you I mean what the letters from Gen Z that I got, the emails were like, 'Hey, shut up over there, lady, because um you ruined the world. You boomer people ruined the world.' And our response is this. And why would we want your values? Look what you did to us with climate change and terrorism and school shootings. You created this world. Why would we buy your version of events?"

不，他们是桀骜不驯的。我的意思是，他们不仅仅是满意。他们是桀骜不驯的。他们就像你一样。我的意思是，我收到的Z世代的来信，邮件中写着：“嘿，那边闭嘴吧，女士，因为你们毁了世界。你们这些婴儿潮一代毁了世界。”而我们的回应是这个。为什么我们要接受你们的价值观？看看你们给我们带来了什么——气候变化、恐怖主义、校园枪击。是你们创造了这个世界。为什么我们要接受你们的叙事？

"Values generally don't change. Okay. All right. Values are generally set by the time we're 25 years old because a lot of things go into that stew. What changes is how much we express them or repress them. So I think what will happen is Jenzie will keep these values because unless you have a seismic event, your values generally stay the same your whole life. Um the seismic event may be not getting a job and then therefore they'll repress certain values or there they'll suppress them not happily."

价值观通常不会改变。好吧。价值观通常在我们25岁时就基本定型了，因为很多因素都会进入这个“大杂烩”。改变的是我们表达或压抑这些价值观的程度。所以，我认为将会发生的是，Z世代会保留这些价值观，因为除非发生某种剧变，否则你的价值观通常会伴随你一生。这种剧变可能是找不到工作，然后他们就会压抑某些价值观，或者他们会不情愿地抑制它们。
