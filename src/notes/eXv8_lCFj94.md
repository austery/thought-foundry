title: “完美独裁”的裂痕：论“墙国”公民的翻墙自救与精神觉醒
summary: 本文深入探讨了中国“防火长城”背后的“完美独裁”体制。文章引用了学者斯坦·林根的“管控专制”概念，剖析了该体制如何通过信息控制实现自我维系。文章区分了“身在奴役”与“心在奴役”两种状态，强调“翻墙”不仅是技术突破，更是追求思想自由、摆脱精神奴役的自救行为。最后，文章借用莱昂纳德·科恩的名言“万物皆有裂痕，光才能照进来”，指出即使在严密的控制下，裂痕依然存在，为希望和改变提供了可能。

### 围墙的建立：隔绝与控制
大家好。最近，很多人反映党的网络“翻墙”工具多次失效，许多梯子都找不到了。翻墙变得时断时续，因为技术总是在进行道高一尺、魔高一丈的博弈。一旦翻墙软件被封堵，你就无法访问外部世界。建墙是一种悠久的传统和统治术。从中国的秦始皇，到明朝，都曾修建物理的城墙。而当互联网世界来临时，中国建立了一道被称为**防火长城**（Great Firewall: 指中国政府对其互联网边界审查系统（包括相关行政审查系统）的统称）的数字高墙。这道网络上的“墙”将中国与世界隔绝开来，使中国的互联网变成了一个巨大的局域网。中国人如果想了解真实的世界，就必须“翻墙”。

<p class="english-text">Everyone. Recently, many people have found that the party's online circumvention tools have failed many times, and many VPNs can't be found. Circumventing the firewall has become intermittent because the technology is always in a cat-and-mouse game. Once the circumvention software is blocked, you can't get out. Building walls is an ancient tradition and a technique of governance. From China's Qin Shihuang to the Ming Dynasty, physical walls were built. When the internet age arrived, China built a digital wall called the Great Firewall. This online "wall" isolates China from the world, turning China's internet into a giant intranet. If Chinese people want to see the real world, they must "climb the wall."</p>

上周我们介绍了周有光先生，他说过信息是阻挡不住的，就像水一样，总会流动的。水从高处往低处流，信息也像水一样，会从信息密集的地方流向信息稀疏的地方。在互联网时代，为什么要耗费巨大的人力物力去建一堵墙呢？为什么要将中国与世界隔绝开来？答案很简单：中国是一个专制国家。为了维持其统治，它必须通过愚民政策来延续其合法性。只有让人民持续看到被筛选过的单一信息，他们才不会产生独立的思考，从而继续忍受并服从统治。

<p class="english-text">Last week, we introduced Mr. Zhou Youguang, who said that information cannot be stopped, just like water, it will always flow. Water flows from high to low places, and information, like water, flows from information-rich areas to information-poor ones. In the internet age, why spend enormous human and material resources to build a wall? Why isolate China from the world? The simple answer is: China is an autocratic state. To maintain its rule, it must rely on a policy of keeping the people ignorant to sustain its legitimacy. Only by keeping the people exposed to a single, filtered stream of information can they be prevented from thinking independently, thus continuing to endure and obey.</p>
</details>

### “身奴”与“心奴”：墙内与墙民
世界上的政权已经很清楚，它们是通过人民的授权、由人民选举产生的。它们在多大程度上是善政，并非由其自我标榜决定，而是由人民评判。而中国建立的这堵墙，是一道囚禁之墙，是愚民之墙。它把一个国家变成了“墙国”，把国民变成了“墙民”。“墙国”是当今中国的现实。那些翻墙出来的人，是为了获得信息，是为了呼吸自由的空气，是为了了解真相，是为了不被愚弄。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Governments around the world have made it clear that they derive their authority from the consent of the governed, elected by the people. The extent to which they are good governments is not determined by self-proclamation but by the judgment of the people. The wall China has built is a wall of imprisonment, a wall to keep people ignorant. It turns a country into a "walled country" and its citizens into "wall citizens." The "walled country" is the reality of China today. Those who climb the wall do so to get information, to breathe the air of freedom, to learn the truth, and to avoid being fooled.</p>
</details>

这其中存在一种可悲与可鄙的区别。一个人，如果身处某个地方，生在一个国家，这是无法选择的。作为一个中国人，出生在这片土地上，这是与生俱来的身份，这个人本身是无辜的。但如果一个人，长期习惯了被圈养的生活，并认为这种生活天经地义，甚至主动去维护这堵墙，去充当“五毛”，那么这个人就是可鄙的。这就是“奴在身者，其人可怜；奴在心者，其人可鄙”。我们不应该做一个甘于被圈养的墙民，而是应该做一个拥有自由思想的公民。

<p class="english-text">There is a distinction between being pitiable and being contemptible. A person's birthplace, the country they are born into, is not a matter of choice. Being born Chinese on this land is an innate identity, and the person is innocent in this regard. However, if a person gets used to a life of being penned in, considers it natural and right, and even actively defends the wall and acts as a "wumao" (a government-paid internet commentator), then that person is contemptible. This is the meaning behind "those enslaved in body are pitiable; those enslaved in mind are contemptible." We should not be content as "wall citizens" but strive to be citizens with free minds.</p>

### “完美独裁”与“管控专制”
“墙国”可以说是一个很好的意象。牛津大学一位名叫斯坦·林根（Stein Ringen）的挪威裔教授，写了一本书，名为《完美的独裁：21世纪的中国》。许多西方学者在研究中国时，认为传统的“专制”（autocracy）一词已经不足以形容其统治模式的精细和深入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Walled country" is a very fitting metaphor. A professor at Oxford University named Stein Ringen, who is of Norwegian descent, wrote a book titled "The Perfect Dictatorship: China in the 21st Century." Many Western scholars studying China believe that the traditional term "autocracy" is no longer sufficient to describe the sophistication and depth of its ruling model.</p>
</details>

为了更准确地描述，林根创造了一个新词：**管控专制**（Controlocracy: 由 control 和 -cracy 结合而成，指一种政府对社会和个人生活进行无孔不入的精细化控制的统治形态）。在这种体制下，政府对人民的控制无处不在。这种统治之所以被称为“完美”，是因为它在某种意义上是独特的。它之所以独特，并非因为政府单方面施加控制，而是因为它成功地让一部分民众参与到这种控制之中，实现了自我审查和互相监督。少数人的声音尚未发出就可能被压制，而许多甘愿做“墙民”的人，则会主动维护这堵墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To describe it more accurately, Ringen coined a new term: "Controlocracy." Under this system, the government's control over the people is omnipresent. This form of rule is called "perfect" because it is unique in a sense. Its uniqueness lies not just in the government imposing control unilaterally, but in its success at getting a portion of the populace to participate in this control, achieving self-censorship and mutual surveillance. The voices of the few can be suppressed before they are even heard, and many who are willing to be "wall citizens" will actively defend this wall.</p>
</details>

### 翻墙的意义：从被动接受到主动探索
然而，中国并非孤立的存在。世界上还有欧洲、韩国等许多国家和地区。那里的人民拥有自由，可以接触到未经审查的世界。中国的这种全面控制模式，试图将亿万人民长期置于一个信息茧房之中，让他们保持思想上的统一和纯洁。这种做法在短期内或许有效，但从长远来看，在一个开放和互联的世界里，试图完全隔绝信息流动是徒劳的。一个封闭的系统，其权力无法长期维持，最终会因内部的僵化和外部的冲击而崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, China is not an isolated entity. There are Europe, South Korea, and many other countries and regions in the world. The people there have freedom and access to an uncensored world. China's model of total control attempts to keep billions of people in an information cocoon long-term, maintaining their ideological unity and purity. This may be effective in the short term, but in the long run, in an open and interconnected world, it is futile to try to completely block the flow of information. A closed system cannot sustain its power indefinitely; it will eventually collapse due to internal rigidity and external pressures.</p>
</details>

那些身处“墙国”但内心强大、思想独立的人，他们虽然身在压抑的环境中，但他们的思想并未被禁锢。他们会努力寻找真相，思考国家的未来。对于“墙民”来说，无论统治者如何强大，他们依然可以仰望星空。如果我们用周有光先生的视角来看待“墙民”的状态，就会豁然开朗。一个封闭的系统虽然可以阻挡信息，但它无法控制甚至影响那些内心强大、拥有自我驱动力的人。他们的文化、价值观是开放的，能够辨别是非，最终会走向正确的道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those who live in the "walled country" but are strong-willed and independent in thought may be in a repressive environment, but their minds are not imprisoned. They will strive to seek the truth and contemplate the future of the country. For the "wall citizens," no matter how powerful the rulers are, they can still look up at the stars. If we view the state of "wall citizens" from Mr. Zhou Youguang's perspective, it becomes quite clear. A closed system can block information, but it cannot control or even influence those who are mentally strong and self-motivated. Their culture and values are open; they can distinguish right from wrong and will ultimately find the right path.</p>
</details>

现在，越来越多不甘为“墙民”的人，有了强烈的翻墙需求。每一次成功的翻墙，都是对这堵墙的冲击。翻墙出来的人，能够获得更广阔的视野，用批判性的眼光审视自己的国家，从而看清问题，做出正确的判断。翻墙是获得真相的第一步，它让你看到被掩盖的事实，接触到新的思想，从而成为一个真正意义上的人。翻墙，走向广阔的世界，意味着你相信自己有权利去获取未经审查的信息，有能力用自己的头脑去思考和判断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, more and more people who are unwilling to be "wall citizens" have a strong need to climb the wall. Every successful act of circumvention is an assault on this wall. People who get out can gain a broader perspective, look at their country with a critical eye, see the problems clearly, and make correct judgments. Climbing the wall is the first step to getting the truth. It allows you to see concealed facts, encounter new ideas, and become a person in the truest sense. To climb the wall and reach the wider world means you believe you have the right to access uncensored information and the ability to think and judge with your own mind.</p>
</details>

### 万物皆有裂痕，那是光照进来的地方
每一次成功的翻墙，都是向自由迈出的一步。这需要勇气，也需要能力。回顾过去几十年，现代文明国家的核心是法治、自由和人权。这些目标能否实现？答案并非必然。现代化的过程并非坦途，许多国家在追求现代化的过程中步入歧途。但至少，在一个正常的社会里，人们拥有基本的权利和尊严。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every successful act of climbing the wall is a step towards freedom. It requires courage and ability. Looking back at the past few decades, the core of modern civilized nations is the rule of law, freedom, and human rights. Can these goals be achieved? The answer is not necessarily yes. The path to modernization is not smooth, and many countries have gone astray in its pursuit. But at least in a normal society, people have basic rights and dignity.</p>
</details>

人们渴望和平、安宁和幸福，这是普世的愿望。加拿大传奇歌手莱昂纳德·科恩（Leonard Cohen）在他的歌曲《颂歌》（Anthem）中写道：“万物皆有裂痕，那是光照进来的地方。”（There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.）这句歌词充满了深刻的哲理。在“墙”上，我们应该去寻找那些裂痕。统治者希望墙是完美的，但裂痕总会存在。

<p class="english-text">People long for peace, tranquility, and happiness; this is a universal desire. The legendary Canadian singer Leonard Cohen wrote in his song "Anthem": "There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in." This lyric is full of profound philosophy. On the "wall," we should look for those cracks. The rulers want the wall to be perfect, but cracks will always exist.</p>
</details>

对于“墙民”来说，首先要找到裂缝，然后走出去。中国的许多人，在现实的压迫下，展现出一种“跪着求生”的姿态。但在任何时代，普通人的第一要务是拯救自己，然后帮助身边的人。当一个人能够帮助他人，让他们睁开眼睛、清洁思想、摆脱蒙昧时，他就是在履行自己的责任。自救不是自私，而是承担责任的开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For the "wall citizens," the first step is to find the cracks and then get out. Many people in China, under the pressure of reality, exhibit a posture of "kneeling to survive." But in any era, the first duty of an ordinary person is to save themselves, and then to help those around them. When a person can help others—to open their eyes, clear their minds, and escape from ignorance—they are fulfilling their responsibility. Self-rescue is not selfishness; it is the beginning of taking responsibility.</p>
</details>

中国社会的一个大问题是，许多人只是跪着，不敢寻求改变。他们每天想的只是如何保全自己。然而，无论是现实世界还是精神世界，都存在着被现代文明之光照亮的道路。莱昂纳德·科恩说，万物皆有裂痕。这堵墙虽然强大，但并非无懈可击。我们应该去寻找那些裂痕，让光照进来，照亮自己，也照亮他人。

<p class="english-text">A major problem in Chinese society is that many people just kneel and dare not seek change. All they think about every day is how to protect themselves. However, in both the physical and spiritual worlds, there are paths illuminated by the light of modern civilization. Leonard Cohen said there is a crack in everything. This wall, though strong, is not impenetrable. We should look for those cracks, let the light in, to illuminate ourselves and others.</p>
