### 加拿大科技行业的增长困境

加拿大科技公司在获取资金和留住人才方面可能面临挑战。那么，我们能做些什么来帮助创始人在本土建立公司呢？**DMZ**（一家位于多伦多都会大学的科技孵化器）的执行董事Abdullah Nobar和**Monarch**（一个领导力发展平台）的首席执行官Kelsey Han与我坐下来解释了这些问题。

<p class="english-text">Canadian tech firms can face challenges getting capital and keeping talent. So, what can we do to help founders build companies here at home? Abdullah Nobar, the executive director of DMZ, a tech incubator at Toronto Metropolitan University, and Kelsey Han, the CEO of Monarch, a leadership development platform, sat down with me to explain.</p>
</details>

[音乐] Abdullah，Kelsey，非常感谢你们加入我们的节目。Kelsey，我想先问你，在加拿大，更大的问题是吸引人们开始创业，还是扩大现有公司的规模？

<details>

<p class="english-text">[Music] Abdullah, Kelsey, thank you so much for joining us on the rundown. Um, I'm gonna start with you, Kelsey. Which is the bigger problem in Canada? Enticing people to begin startups or increasing the size of existing ones?</p>
</details>

### 加拿大创业生态的挑战

Kelsey: 我认为对我来说，我可能会选择吸引人们开始创业。我认为加拿大目前面临着一定的创业挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: I think for me um there I would probably go with um enticing people to start companies. I you know I think part of what we have in Canada right now is a bit of an entrepreneurship challenge.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 这个国家是建立在企业家精神之上的。如果你仔细想想，我们大多数人距离那些移居到这个国家并创办自己事业的父母或祖父母，也只有一两代人的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um this country was built on entrepreneurs. If you think about it, we are only most of us are only one or two generations removed from parents or grandparents that moved to this country uh and started their own businesses.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 在过去的20年里，我们看到创业率一直在下降。与20年前相比，我们大约少了10万名创业者。然而在同一时期，我们的人口却大幅增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: And I, you know, what we've seen over the last 20 years is entrepreneurship rates have been lowering. Um and so we have approximately um 100,000 less than we did 20 years ago. And yet over that same period, our population has increased drastically.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 我认为，在某些方面，创业会带有一些污名。你知道，在美国，我们颂扬企业家，创业更像是一种荣誉和经验的象征，我们甚至庆祝失败。但在加拿大，我可以代表自己说，当我第一次想到创业时，我脑海中第一个念头就是，如果我失败了，我可能不得不搬走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um and so I think you know there's there's a little bit of um stigma in some ways that comes with entrepreneurship. You know in the US we celebrate entrepreneurs and it looks a little bit more like a badge of honor and experience and we celebrate failure and in Canada um you know I can speak for myself but the you know the first thing I thought when starting a company was oh I'm going to have to move away if I fail</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 因为我可能会失去所有的社交网络和人脉。所以，是的，我认为对我来说，这更多是关于创业的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: um because I would lose you know all my networks and contacts. So yeah, I think for me it's it's more of the entrepreneurship piece.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 老实说，这两者是如此紧密相连，以至于很难只指出其中一个。但我确实同意Kelsey的观点。在一个需要建立正确激励机制来帮助企业家在加拿大启动想法和创办公司的市场中，要看到所需的活力正变得越来越具有挑战性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: they're so intertwined to be honest with you that it's hard to kind of pinpoint on one. I do agree with Kelsey though. It is becoming a bigger challenge for you know to see the the energy that you need in a market that needs to build the right incentives to to help entrepreneurs kind of start an idea and start a company here in Canada.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 说实话，一旦人们创办了公司，我认为他们很快就会意识到在加拿大扩大规模是多么困难，这不仅仅是因为我们是一个小国家，更是因为尚未创造出能让企业家充分利用加拿大所能提供的一切的条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Truth be told, once people build a company, I think they quickly realize how difficult it is to scale uh uh in in Canada, not because we're in a small country only, but because the conditions haven't been created in a way that would allow an entrepreneur to really leverage the full extent of what Canada has to offer.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 我们知道可以谈论很多这些问题，但我们今天确实确定了三个主要挑战领域。首先是，如何将**IP**（Intellectual Property: 知识产权）转化为商业化？这实际上回到了一个问题：我们如何才能真正建立起有潜力在未来成为十亿美元级企业的优秀公司，通过利用我们国家投入到研究中的巨额资金，但却未能真正建立起激励机制，将这些研究转化为商业现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Um, and I know we could talk a lot about these things, but three areas that we really uh identified as big challenges today. Uh, number one is, you know, how do you take IP to commercialization? And that really gets back to the question of how do you really build really good companies that have the potential to become billion-dollar businesses in the future uh by leveraging the in insane amount of dollars that we're putting into research here in this country, but uh and not able to really build the incentives to get that research to commercial uh uh reality.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 第二部分是关于**VC**（Venture Capital: 风险投资）和风险资本的资金，能够支持公司增长的资金在很多方面是有限的。我不会说它不存在，因为那不真实，但它非常有限，无法真正满足初创企业在整个需求漏斗中的所有需求，尤其是在加拿大拥有大量人才的情况下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: The second part is around VC and just venture capital dollars and the amount of money that can be supporting the company's growth in many ways limited. I won't say non-existent because that's not true, but it's very limited um in a way that doesn't really feed the entire funnel of of of of need uh from a startup perspective, especially with the amount of talent that we have uh in Canada.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 最后，我认为政府实际上在这方面扮演着重要角色，能够让许多本地和全球受支持的企业家和创始人受到关注。但这更深入到采购，甚至购买加拿大产品和优先考虑加拿大人的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: And then finally, I think the government uh plays a big role in this actually and being able to shine a light on a lot of the entrepreneurs and the founders that are being supported uh locally and globally. Uh but then it goes deeper into things like procurement uh and even uh into buying Canadian and putting Canadians first.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大科技公司为何“南下”？

Kelsey，有一些加拿大公司会去美国。我们是否知道有多少加拿大科技公司选择“南下”寻求更好的发展机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey, there are some companies, Canadian companies that go to the US. uh do we have an idea of how many uh Canadian tech firms are deciding to go south of the border for maybe greener pastures?</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 是的，你看，我认为每个加拿大创始人在创办公司时，可能听到的第一条建议就是把你的产品推向美国。这几乎是标准策略：如果你能在加拿大境内建立公司和培养人才，就尽快到加拿大境外获取收入。在我们的国界之外验证你的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Yeah, I mean look, I think every Canadian founder starts their company and probably one of the first pieces of advice they hear is get your product to the US. I mean that is the playbook. build if you can build your company, build your talent inside of Canada and go get your revenue outside of Canada as soon as possible. Validate beyond our borders.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，我认为这有利有弊，但这主要是市场规模的问题。我们显然知道这一点。那里有更多的机会。但我认为，这又回到了我关于生产力的观点：那里也更愿意更快地采纳技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, and I think, you know, there's some pros and cons to that, but um, it's it's largely an issue of market size. Um, we know that obviously. Um, there's just much more opportunity there. But I think when it comes to, it kind of goes back to my point around productivity. there's also just a willingness to adopt technology faster.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 因此，你会听到一些加拿大公司的故事，比如卡尔加里有一家公司，其90%以上的客户来自美国，但他们却有100多名员工总部设在艾伯塔省。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, and so, you know, you hear of these stories where Canadian companies, you know, there's one in Calgary that has um I think over 90% of their customer base comes from the US, but they have over 100 employees headquartered in Alberta.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，这对于许多加拿大初创公司来说是一个常见的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, and so that that's a common story for many many Canadian startups.</p>
</details>

Abdullah，你身处孵化领域。有一些非常渴望创造事物的人，我想你也许可以接着Kelsey刚才说的，去美国是他们的“策略”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah, you are in the incubation space. there are some very, you know, eager people to build something and I imagine maybe if you can pick up on the point what Kelsey said is the playbook to go to the US.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 看，是的，我们没有创新问题。我们没有人才问题。我们当然也没有雄心问题。我们今天已经建立了伟大的公司。加拿大在许多方面都曾是创新的领导者，我们拥有令人难以置信的过去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Look, yeah, we we don't have an innovation problem. We don't have a talent problem. Uh we certainly don't have an ambition problem in Canada. We have we've built great companies today. We've had an an an incredible uh uh past where Canada has been a leader on innovation in many ways.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 我们所缺乏的是正确的**基础设施**和适当的激励措施，以允许人们在加拿大境内充分发挥其潜力。我的意思是，当有人想要扩张和发展他们的公司时，他们不会考虑从安大略省去艾伯塔省，或者去不列颠哥伦比亚省，或者去魁北克省。他们会考虑南下，因为跨省发展实际上会遇到很多障碍和繁文缛节，而我们没有意识到这是一种错失的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: what we don't have is the right infrastructure and the right incentives in place to allow uh people to really again build for to their full extent while being here in Canada. And what I mean by that when someone's looking to expand and build their company, they don't think about going from Ontario to Alberta or to BC or to Quebec. They think about going south because it actually is uh a lot of hurdles and red tape that they have to encounter by going interprovincial uh that we don't realize is a lost opportunity.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 这是创始人必须面对的现实的一部分。当你创办一家公司时，那是你的生计。你会不惜一切代价让公司生存下去。如果这意味着南下，你就会那样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: And this is part of the reality that founders have to face. And when you're building a company, it's your livelihood. You will do whatever it takes to keep that company alive. And if it means going south, that's what you do.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 但加拿大人在这里所能做的，肯定不缺乏雄心壮志。坦率地说，创业的必要性必须始终从全球角度考虑。我们目前面临的挑战是，加拿大人有时会离开本国到国外发展。情况不一定非要如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Uh but there certainly isn't a lack of of of of ambition in what Canadians can do here. And and quite quite frankly, the need to to build a business has to always be thought of globally. uh where our challenges come to come to come to set right now is that Canadians are leaving sometimes the country to go build abroad. That doesn't need to be the case.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: Kelsey就是一个很好的例子，她可以继续留在加拿大，在自己的家乡，建立全球业务，招聘全球人才，但将公司总部设在加拿大。这应该是我们未来继续构建的故事线。否则，我们真的会失去它。这是一个我们能够掌控的故事，叙事应该对我们有利，但我们却没有建立正确的基石来朝着那个方向前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Uh Kelsey as is a good example of that can continue being in Canada, being in her home, building a global business, hiring global talent, uh but focusing her HQ here right here in Canada. That needs to be the story line that we continue building moving forward. Otherwise, it's really it's ours to lose. It's a story that we have control of. the narrative should be in our favor, but you know, we're not building the right blocks to to to to go in that direction.</p>
</details>

好的，我想继续和Kelsey聊聊。Abdullah，你提到了省际贸易壁垒。Kelsey，你身在加拿大。我很好奇，有哪些障碍？那些国际壁垒可能阻止你在美国发展，如果那是你想要做的事情的话？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, I want to pick up with Kelsey. Uh Abdullah, you talked about interprovincial trade barriers. Uh Kelsey, you are based in Canada. Um I am curious, what are the barriers? What are those international barriers that are maybe perhaps permit uh you know stopping you from building in the US if that is something that you want to do?</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 是的。老实说，我们是一家基于**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）的公司，我们做的一件事就是提供一个领导力智能产品。我们分析领导者及其直接下属的实时会议数据。然后我们将这些数据转化为绩效洞察，帮助他们更轻松地管理工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Yeah. So uh honestly we're an AI based uh company and so one of the things we do is we we have a leadership intelligence product. So we analyze real-time meeting data from leaders and their direct reports. Um and then we turn that into performance insights to help them manage their lives more easily.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 当然，我们最大的挑战之一是安全风险合规性，以及欧洲、英国和美国等地的各种不同标准，这些标准因地区而异。比如，关于记录者的规则、可以保留何种数据、数据存储在哪里以及如何使用这些数据，都存在很大差异。因此，对于**AI**公司来说，在跨越这些边界时，这将是最大的挑战之一，我认为这可能是一个紧迫的问题。我相信在未来几年内，所有这些问题都将迅速浮出水面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um and so one of our biggest challenges of course is security risk compliance um and all of the different standards you know across Europe, the UK and the US um which which vary right um based on where you are the you know the rules of notetakers what kind of data you can keep where it is stored um how you use that data highly varies. So that would be one of the biggest challenges as AI companies navigate those borders which I think you know I think that's probably an acute problem. I think we're going to see that all catch up rapidly over the next um couple of years.</p>
</details>

### AI时代下的融资与人才

Kelsey，我想继续和你聊聊，我们来谈谈钱。如果你把公司搬到美国，你认为你能筹集到多少资金？如果我没记错的话，卡尔加里是不是403区号？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to stick with you Kelsey because I want to talk a little bit of uh let's talk dollars. Um how much money do you think you could raise if you moved your company to the US? Because correct me if I'm wrong. Is it a is it a 403 area code in Calgary?</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

当我们谈论投资者时，当他们看到403区号，而不是美国南部的区号时，是否存在一些歧视？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is is there does there is there a little discrimination when uh we're talking investors when they see maybe a 403 area code versus uh maybe area code south of the border?</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 哦，哦，是的。我认为这在投资中肯定是一个方面。但在销售中也毫无疑问，我们显然收到了大量来自加拿大公司的咨询，而且有一种因素是“我们得确保他们不会觉得我们太加拿大化了”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Oh. Oh yeah. I mean I think that's one piece in investing for sure. Um but no question as well in selling I think um we get obviously tons of inbound from Canadian companies and um there is an element of let's make sure they don't see we're too Canadian</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，因为这可能暗示我们行动较慢，团队规模较小，或者在美国没有客户。你知道，这只会发出你不想让客户因此而无法进入下一轮会议阶段的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: um because that would signal maybe we move slower, maybe we're a smaller team, um maybe we don't have clients in the US. it, you know, and it just signals the things that you don't want a client to not get you to that next meeting stage.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 是的，我有一些创始人朋友，他们会特意购买和使用不同区号的号码，以确保他们在进行陌生电话销售时，不会显得是来自加拿大的号码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, yeah, and I have friends that, um, have you founder friends that purposely buy and use different area code numbers to make sure that when they're cold calling and doing their sales calls, um, it doesn't appear that they're coming from a Canadian number.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 所以，是的，许多加拿大初创公司都了解一些这些行业的小窍门，以确保在销售或投资过程中消除一些偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: And so yeah, lots of Canadian startups know a little bit of those tricks of the trade um to make sure that you know we take some of that bias out of either the sales or the investment process.</p>
</details>

很好。Abdullah，Kelsey提到了**AI**，那我们也来谈谈这个。如果加拿大科技公司的业务没有利用**AI**，它们现在获得融资的难度有多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very good. Abdullah, um Kelsey talked AI, so let's talk a little bit about that. How much harder is it for Canadian tech firms to find funding right now if their business is not leveraged by AI?</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 是的，你看，我们现在正处在一个**AI**（人工智能）、**生成式AI**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）无处不在的时代，对吧？所以，很多公司的创始人都已经将他们的业务转型，要么被称为原生**AI**公司，要么是**AI**赋能的企业。这确实是一种趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Yeah, look, we're in a moment now where AI, generative AI is everything, right? So, you know, a lot of the founders in the companies have now shifted their businesses to be called either native AI companies or AI enabled businesses. It really is the movement.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 但是，你看，**AI**需要以某种方式融入。那些正在构建深度技术并真正思考未来和即将到来的事物的公司，自然而然地会将**AI**融入到他们的初创企业中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Um, but um, look, it I I it needs to be incorporated in some way, shape or form. uh and companies that are building deep technologies and really thinking about the future and what's what's to come are naturally just incorporating AI into into their into their startup.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 所以，这不再是是否融入的问题，而是**AI**在业务中实际融入的深度，以及你如何利用它来创造差异化产品的问题。因此，如果没有经过深思熟虑的整合，想要获得风险投资的资金肯定会很困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: So it's not uh you know it's no longer a matter of is is it incorporated it's a matter of how how deep into the business actually is it layered in and what are you doing with it to create a differentiated product. So it it would certainly be difficult to you know capture the the VC dollars if you will uh without having that well thought out.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 但是，加拿大一直处于这个领域的前沿，我们应该为我们帮助建立了世界上一些最强大的**AI**能力而感到自豪，而且我们在加拿大本土就拥有如此强大的实力和严谨性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Um uh and but again Canada is has always been you know at the forefront of this space and you know um something that we should take pride in the fact that we've helped build some of the biggest capabilities in the world from an AI perspective and something that we have such strength and and and uh and rigor with and right here in our backyard in Canada.</p>
</details>

我们知道**AI**编程与传统编码不同。Kelsey，我们是否有足够的**AI**毕业生或经验丰富的程序员来应对目前的需求？你现在正在招聘吗？你是否在寻找程序员和编码员？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A AI programming we know is is different than traditional coding. Kelsey, do we have enough AI graduates or experienced coders who could handle um the demand that is out there right now? Are you hiring right now? Are you looking for uh some programmers and coders?</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 是的。不，我的意思是，我们一直在招聘**AI**人才，并努力留住他们。我认为我们很幸运能在加拿大，这是一个很棒的居住地，可以组建家庭，拥有令人难以置信的工作与生活平衡。这里显然仍然相对负担得起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Yeah. No, I mean always hiring AI talent and trying to keep them with us. You know, I think we we are lucky in Canada in that is an amazing place to live, build a family, incredible work life balance. It's still obviously relatively affordable</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，你知道，政治稳定。所以我们确实有其他因素可以吸引人们来这里安家落户。我认为对于许多初创公司来说，我们正紧紧抓住这一点，因为如果我们的人才南下，我们将无法在薪资和加元贬值方面进行竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: um you know, politically stable. And so we do have other factors that can attract um people to come and set up their lives. And I think for many startups, we're holding on to that because if our talent went south, we would not be able to compete on the salaries and the drop of our dollar.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 因此，我们的竞争力正在变得越来越弱。我是否认为我们这里有人才？我是否认为我们能够继续吸引人才？绝对是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: And so, we're just becoming less and less competitive. Do I think that we have the the talent here? And do I think we can continue to attract the talent? Absolutely.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 但是，你知道，**AI**开发者，我认为和其他开发者和工程师一样，他们都想为那些有魄力的大型创新公司工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um but you know AI developers and I think no different than other developers and engineers they want to work for big innovative companies that have gumption.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，所以，你知道，这更像是我的行动呼吁，就是我们需要支持这些大公司，就像Abdullah所说的那样，帮助它们度过或进入增长阶段，因为他们渴望激动人心、有深度、具有挑战性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um and so you know that would be more of my call to action is like we need to support these big companies to Abdullah's point like getting past that or into that growth stage um because they want exciting meaty challenging problems.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 他们渴望解决这些问题。他们充满求知欲，非常好奇，我们需要把这些人才留在这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um they want to solve them. They're hungry. They're very curious and we need to keep that talent here.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大科技行业发展的激励与解决方案

那么，Abdullah，我们来谈谈激励措施。雇主可以提供哪些激励措施来留住加拿大的人才？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's talk incentives, Abdullah. What incentives uh can employers uh put out there to keep people here in Canada?</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 嗯，你看，从我的角度来看，很多问题归结为，对于特定的初创公司，要想让它们留在加拿大并继续发展壮大，你需要建立我们所知的美国南方做得最好的两件事：速度，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Well, look, a lot of it comes down to from my side, I'm talking about particular startups, you know, to keep startups here in Canada and want them to kind of continue to grow and scale their businesses. You need to build maybe the two of the biggest things that we know in the in the south in the US that they've done really well is speed,</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 规模，以及实际获得政府合同的能力。如果我们能够找到一种模式，推动这里的市场开始成为先行者，而不是总是在美国做什么以及如何做方面充当追随者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: scale, and the ability to actually procure government contracts. Um, if we're able to figure out a model that would push uh the the the market here to start being first to move as opposed to always be a follow a follower in terms of what the US is doing and how the US is doing things.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 能够真正消除一些繁文缛节和壁垒，让加拿大人能够在自己的“后院”——从一个省到另一个省，从一个市场到另一个市场——实现规模化发展，特别是针对政府。想象一下，如果有一天我们能够为创始人解锁这个国家最大的客户，让他们真正加以利用，这样当他们走向国际并开始发展公司、招聘最优秀的人才时，他们就可以从这样一个优势地位出发：我们世界上最大的客户之一是加拿大政府，或者是安大略省、艾伯塔省、不列颠哥伦比亚省、魁北克省的省政府。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: uh the ability to actually uh remove some red tape and the barriers uh uh that would allow Canadians to scale within their own uh backyard uh from province to province to province from market and then in particular to government um and imagine for a day that we're able to unlock the biggest customer in the country for founders to actually leverage so that when they go abroad and start to to grow their companies and hire the best talent they can start with the position that our biggest customer or one of our biggest customers in the world is the Canadian government or the provincial government of Ontario of Alberta, BC of Quebec.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 这本身就具有巨大的分量，而我们尚未能够攻克。所以我认为这些是一些重要的激励措施，超越了Kelsey提到的安全、生活水平和稳定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: Uh that in itself holds so much weight that we haven't been able to crack yet. So I I think those are some of the big incentives that will beyond what uh what you know Kelsey mentioned around safety and standard of living and stability.</p>
</details>

Abdullah: 你知道，需要再次有一个完整的、有凝聚力的市场开放，让公司能够看到自己能够建立一个真正成长和扩展的业务。而且这必须超越加拿大人非常擅长获得的非稀释性资金和赠款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Abdullah: You know there needs to be again an entire uh uh cohesive market that's opening up that allows companies to see themselves being able to build a business that would actually grow and scale. And it has to go beyond the non-dilutive funding the grants that Canadians are so well equipped to get.</p>

Abdullah: 但是，这本身并不能使我们在建设我们想要建设的方面成为最具竞争力的国家。我们需要创建一个具有速度的市场，一个能够思考跨越边界、跨越省份、跨越国家进行规模化发展的市场，然后从政府的角度来看待采购。

<p class="english-text">Abdullah: uh but um that in itself won't make us the most competitive nation uh in building what we want to build. We need to create a market that's that know that has speed that's able to uh think about scale across borders across uh provinces across countries and then looking at procurement from a government perspective.</p>

Kelsey，最后一个问题给你。有哪些潜在的解决方案可以吸引科技公司将总部留在加拿大？天哪，太多了。我的意思是，我认为税收优惠当然有帮助。

<p class="english-text">Kelsey, last question to you. What are some of those potential solutions to entice, you know, tech firms to remain headquartered in Canada? Oh gosh, so many. I mean, I think of course tax incentives help.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 当然，加拿大政府为研发提供激励的**SHRED**（Scientific Research and Experimental Development: 科学研究与实验开发）计划非常棒，我们需要更多类似的激励措施来支持加拿大企业，例如Abdullah提到的政府合同，以及购买加拿大科技产品。

<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Of course, the scientific research uh the shred program that the Canadian government incentivizes for R&D is incredible and we need more incentives like that for Canadian businesses around, you know, Abdullah mentioned it, government contracts around buying Canadian tech.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，所以，税收抵免、鼓励采纳的激励措施、试点项目。嗯，你知道，我认为作为加拿大人，我们必须面对一个事实：我们天生不喜欢风险。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, so tax credits, incentives to encourage adoption, pilots. Um, you know, I think we have to face it as Canadians. We do not we inherently don't like risk.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，这很不幸，对吧？我们总是有一种文化信念，认为我们不够好。我们不如美国，也许我们的产品也不如他们，但这绝对不是真的。我们的产品同样优秀，甚至更好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um, which is unfortunate, right? We're we're kind of we always have this cultural belief that just we aren't good enough. We aren't as good as the US and maybe our products aren't as good, which is absolutely not true. Our products are as good, if not better.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 因此，我们总是在寻求外部验证，我认为我们需要成为我们自己的企业家的拥护者。我们需要深入挖掘这个国家的起源。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um and so we're always looking for that external validation and um I think we need to be the champion of our own entrepreneurs. We need to dig in to what started this country.</p>
</details>

Kelsey: 嗯，我们需要倡导和支持我们正在这里建设的那些令人难以置信的想法和创新生态系统。这不仅仅是科技本身。它超越了科技的边界，对吧？就像Abdullah所说的，这包括大学、生态系统合作伙伴、政府和私营企业，以及加拿大其他中小型企业。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Kelsey: Um and we need to champion and support the incredible ideas and innovation ecosystem that we are building here. Um and that is not just tech in and of itself. It goes beyond the tech borders. Right? That's to to Abdullah's point from uh universities, ecosystem partners, government and private businesses, other small tomedium enterprises in Canada.</p>
