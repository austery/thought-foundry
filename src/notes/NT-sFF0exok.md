### 市场全线反弹，标普500逼近历史高点

大家好，欢迎回到本期的市场收盘分析。今天市场有很多值得讨论的话题。标普500指数在收盘时试图冲击历史新高，我们基本上回到了两周前的位置，这很令人欣慰。标普500指数目前报67194点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. I'm sorry I'm late. Literally before going live, the camera was being stupid. I know that's a dog ate my homework excuse, but like three, four times this week, the camera's been done. But we are back. We are live. We got a lot of stuff to talk about, folks. We got the S&P 500 that's trying to get to alltime highs on the close, which is well, I mean, we are basically back to where we were from two weeks ago, which is nice to see. 67194 right here on the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

我们看到的不仅仅是标普指数的反弹，特斯拉也试图冲击448美元，而今天早上该股还在418美元。Palantir目前上涨了3%。Robin Hood今天表现非常出色，报134.87美元。标普500指数今天上涨了0.6%。SoFi上涨4%，Grab涨至5.70美元，谷歌上涨0.5%，AMD上涨1.6%。就连亚马逊今天也突破了220美元，达到221美元。Meta回到了735美元。可以说，今天是非常不可思议的一天。SMCI则表现不佳，下跌了约9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you've got a rebound, not just on the S&P, but Tessy trying to go for 448. The stock was at 418 this morning. Palanteer up 3% right now. We got the Karp interview on Fox News that we'll take a look at. Robin Hood 13487. Big big day for Robin Hood. You got the S&P 500 again up 6% on the day. SoFi's up 4%. Grab got to 570. Google's up half a percent. AMD up 1.6. Even Amazon breaking 220 on the day at 221. Meta back at 735. I mean, it's been a pretty incredible day. SMCI a little bit more of an ugly day down about 9%.</p>
</details>

就连比特币表现也不差。今天早上比特币价格为106,000美元，现在回到了110,000美元。所以整个市场都出现了明显的反弹。Coreweave上涨2%，Rocket Lab上涨5%，ASML当天持平，但比几天前要好。其他高质量成长股，如CrowdStrike报519美元，当天上涨4%。Coinbase上涨1.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and even Bitcoin not doing too bad. Bitcoin was at 106 this morning. now back at 110. So you've seen a obvious rebound across the entire market. Coreweave up 2%, Rocket Lab up 5%, AS flat on the day, but not as bad as it was a couple of days ago. Uh obviously you've got all the other names in terms of high quality growth like a crowd strike 519 that's up 4% of the day. Coinbase is up 1.4%.</p>
</details>

### 市场上涨背后的多重驱动力

那么，这一切为什么会发生呢？我们实际上有一系列不同的新闻头条来解释整个市场的上涨。我认为首要原因是卖家和空头可能已经有些筋疲力尽了。过去两周，整个市场都在经历艰难的抛售，特别是对于高动能股票，也包括像Meta、苹果、谷歌等大型科技股。现在我们开始看到一些反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the reason is why is this happening? The reason is why is this happening? And we actually have a bunch of different headlines to talk about uh for why this is happening across the entire board. I think the number one reason is the sellers and the shorts probably got a bit exhausted. It has been a rough two weeks of selling across the board. Definitely for high driven momentum stocks also just random names like uh your average Meta, Apple, Google, right? All the big tech names that got hit and you're starting to see a little bit of rebound.</p>
</details>

其次，特朗普发表了一些看起来相对乐观的言论。大约一小时前，他确认了将于10月30日与习近平主席举行面对面会晤。这次会晤的正式确认也为市场注入了更多动力。他宣布消息后，市场立刻表现出积极反应，可以想见市场会喜欢这种进展，因为它乐于看到谈判顺利进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is Trump is saying a bunch of stuff that seems relatively bullish. So the first thing he said about an hour ago was that he confirmed the October 30th meeting in person with President Xi. October 30th meeting with President Xi. As a result of that meeting officially being confirmed, that is why you're also seeing some more momentum. Uh the market as soon as he announced that started to really like it and you would imagine the market would like that because you know the market enjoys that uh the negotiations are going well.</p>
</details>

这是第一点。特朗普目前正在直播，发表了很多言论。我们会尽量获取一些他的讲话内容。他刚刚提到的一件事是，他接到了英伟达黄仁勋关于旧金山的电话。稍后我会提供更多相关背景信息，但他现在确实在发表讲话。最重要的一点是，中美会晤定于10月30日举行，这恰好在**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会，负责制定美国货币政策）会议后一天，也早于他与世界其他官员（可能包括金正恩）的会晤。因此，下周的这次会晤将非常及时且重要，我们需要关注它可能带来的实际影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was the first thing. Trump's live right now. He's saying a bunch of things. We'll try to get a bunch of those quotes. One of the quotes he just said was he got a call from Nvidia's Jensen Hang about San Francisco. I'll get some more context on those quotes in a second, but he is he is saying a bunch of things right now. One of the number one things is that the China meetings are set to go for October 30th, which is a day after the FOMC meeting and a day before uh he continues to have meetings with other officials across the world, potentially even Kim Jong-un. So that meeting is going to be very timely next week and very important in terms of seeing what that could actually do.</p>
</details>

### 市场情绪与资金流向

今天，**货币市场基金**（Money Market Funds: 投资于短期、低风险债务工具的共同基金，提供类似现金的流动性和安全性）的数据也公布了。上周货币市场基金减少了150亿美元，而本周的数据显示，货币市场基金增加了300亿美元，总额达到7.4万亿美元。这表明仍有大量资金处于观望状态。人们仍然希望获得无风险的回报，这就是为什么这些货币市场基金的规模能达到如此高的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, money market funds. We have the results. Uh let's put in the chat before I say it. Increase or decrease? What do you think? Last week we had a decrease in money market funds by 15 billion. We have the updated numbers here. And I will uh show you guys what those numbers are. And let's just say there's still a lot of money on the sidelines. There is still a lot of freaking money on the sidelines. Decrease, decrease, increase, decrease. The answer is officially increased. Money market funds increase by 30 billion as you can see right there to 7.4 trillion. 7.44 trillion is what we have on these money market funds. So I mean look it it shows that people still want a return that is not going to be uh you know risking any and as a result of that return not risking anything that is why you have these money market funds getting to these levels 7.4 trillion 30.37 billion is what you are uh seeing right there.</p>
</details>

### 盘后焦点：英特尔与福特财报解析

收盘后，我们迎来了英特尔和福特的财报，这两份财报都非常重要。华尔街对英特尔的期望并不高，预计每股收益为1美分，营收为131.4亿美元。所以任何超出这个数字的业绩都会被视为利好。英特尔在大约五个季度前取消了股息，所以问题就在于他们这次能交出什么样的成绩单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what do we have after the bell? We have Intel and Ford. Intel and Ford. Those are going to be very, very important earnings. Let me know in the chat if anyone owns those names. We'll actually do a poll right here on Intel and Ford. Now, the street, it doesn't have the highest expectations for Intel. Uh, let me just pull up the numbers right here. Ford, you know, tends to be not as volatile. Intel, I believe, is a 5% move up or down baked into it. Intel Street wants 1 cent per share and 13.14 billion in revenue. So, they're not expecting too much. Anything above that would be good. Intel again did get rid of their dividend about five quarters ago. So, question is just going to be what they can put up on these results.</p>
</details>

英特尔今年迄今为止的股价涨幅可观，今天上涨了2%，年初至今上涨了87%。他们确实没有多少犯错的空间。但另一方面，美国政府向他们注资了90亿美元。所以，谁知道呢？如果他们能拿出任何有意义的业绩，可能会让华尔街兴奋，股价或许会被重新评级至43到45美元的区间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Intel right here is up a decent chunk year to date. It's up 2% on the day. So, you're getting a pre- action move as we get into it. And it's up, yeah, 87% year-to date. I mean, they don't really have room to mess up. But then again, the US government pumped 9 billion into them. So, I mean, who knows? Maybe this gets rerated into the 43s, 45s now that the government's backing them. If they can put up any level of meaningful results, that would get the street excited. But that's what you got right there on Intel. 78% of you think Intel outperforms Ford.</p>
</details>

### 英特尔财报：震惊市场的20倍盈利超越

英特尔的财报出来了，这简直是巨大的惊喜。他们公布的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，衡量公司盈利能力的关键指标）是23美分，而市场预期仅为1美分，盈利超出预期2000%。营收方面，他们实现了136亿美元，也超过了预期的131.4亿美元。这看起来是真实的数据，多个消息来源都证实了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, wow. Okay. Hold on. Is this accurate? Before I say it, I want to make sure it's accurate. Are you guys seeing the same thing I'm seeing on EPS? If this is accurate, this stock's going to 40. I feel like it's going to 40. This is the number I have. This is not a confirmed number. I want to confirm it with multiple sources, but what I'm looking at is they beat EPS by 2,000%. 23 cents versus 1 cent expected. 13.6 billion versus 13.14. Trying to confirm if they actually did con. Yeah, that looks like the number. It looks like the number. That looks I have two sources, three sources now confirming it. It looks like they beat by two,000%. Well, we know why Donny T invested now. We know why Donny T invested now. I have three sources I'm looking at saying this is the number. It doesn't look fake. I mean, the stock's not reacting like it's fake. Dude, that's a big beat. 23 cents a share. Are you kidding me? When the street was expecting 1 cent. That's a big beat.</p>
</details>

更多细节显示，英特尔第三季度的毛利率为40%，远高于预期的36%，这是一个高达4%的超越。对于一个硬件业务来说，挤出利润并不容易。第四季度营收指引为128亿至138亿美元。数据中心业务营收为41.2亿美元，超过预期的39.7亿美元；客户端计算业务营收为84亿美元，超过预期的81亿美元。不过，**Foundry**（Foundry: 晶圆代工，指专门从事半导体晶圆制造，而不进行设计的公司）业务营收为42亿美元，低于预期的45亿美元。尽管Foundry业务未达标，但客户端计算和数据中心业务的强劲表现足以弥补，股价应声上涨至40美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some more results. Uh gross margins 40% on Intel in the third quarter versus 36% expected. That's a hell of a beat by 4%. Again, Intel's a hardware business, not easy to squeak out a margin. Uh, that's a 4% beat. They see their third quarter revenue 13.65 billion. That's up against expectations. Fourth quarter revenue, they're guiding for 12.8 to 13.8. Data center revenue 4.12 versus 3.97. That's a beat. Client computing revenue 8.4 versus 8.1. That's a beat. Foundry revenue 4.2 versus 4.5. That's a miss. They missed on Foundry. They beat on client computing. They beat on data center. There. There. There it goes. 40. There you go. 40 bucks. As soon as I saw the EPS beat, and I think as soon as you guys saw it, it was pretty obvious this one was going to fly. This one was going to fly. There it is. 40 bucks on Intel. 5.7% now 6.3% on the day.</p>
</details>

CNBC的报道指出，英特尔CFO戴夫·津斯纳表示，由于数据中心更新换代的速度“快于预期”，他们目前面临供应短缺。他预计这种供应紧张状况可能会持续到明年第一、第二甚至第三季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I caught up with Intel CFO Dave Zner just moments ago and he told me that they are pretty short on supply because the data center refresh is happening quote faster than anticipated. They met demand with inventory on hand and he's saying that they're going to be behind in Q1, probably Q2, maybe even Q3 because of this supply crunch. He said they're also doing a good job shoring up cash on their balance sheet. Of course, we know why. The US government's cash injection. They also got money from selling a 51% stake in Alterara.</p>
</details>

### 福特与其他公司财报表现

福特的财报也出炉了。他们在每股收益和营收上都超出了预期。EPS为45美分，高于预期的36美分；营收也超出7%。尽管业绩超预期，但该股却下跌了4%。这可能是因为他们下调了调整后自由现金流的预期，从35-40亿美元下调至20-30亿美元，并且对2026财年的调整后EBITDA预期也低于华尔街的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ford, uh, I think we have a beat on Ford, folks. Ford is down 4%. Ford, yeah, beat by 25% on EPS, beat by 7% on revenue, 45 cents versus 36 cents. Regardless of what the stock is doing, we as investors care that companies are beating earnings because that can continue to say that the multiple on the S&P is not overstretched. So, it's nice to see a beat on the top and the bottom on Intel and Ford beat by 7% on revenue, 25% on EPS. Stock is down 4% right here. A little bit of reverse. Uh they see their adjusted free cash flow two to three billion instead of 3.5 to four. So I guess that's a little lower than expected. And then Street wanted 7.5 billion of adjusted Ebida for fiscal year 26. They're coming at 6.5 billion. Again, not the worst miss, but nonetheless, that's probably explaining why Ford is getting hit right there.</p>
</details>

其他公司方面，Deckers的业绩也超出了预期，但股价同样下跌。Digital Realty Trust (DLR) 的EPS超出预期510%，这是一家市值600亿美元的公司，业绩非常惊人。这些公司普遍超出EPS预期的现象表明，它们的利润率可能正在改善，好于华尔街的预期。利润率的提升很可能归功于两个字母：A和I。如果这个趋势在整个财报季得到证实，那么AI正在创造利润改善，这也为标普500指数估值的扩张提供了合理解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Deckers is down not as aggressively. Deckers. Well, now down 4%. Let me see if I can get those numbers there for deck. Deckers. Wow. Top and the bottom beat by 15%. EPS is up 14% year-over-year. Digital Realy. Wow. $510% EPS beat. Oh my goodness. This is a $60 billion company, guys. The the quick takeaway real quick from all these companies that are beating on EPS is that their margins are probably getting better. Better than what the street thought, which is why they're able to beat these numbers, margins getting better is likely because of two letters, A and I. And if that is true, and we hear a lot of that commentary throughout this earning cycle on these calls, then AI is creating margin improvement, aka it should be expanding the overall multiple on the S&P or at least make sense of why the multiple on the S&P is getting extended.</p>

### 科技巨头动态：亚马逊、英伟达与谷歌的新合作

亚马逊发布了用于司机的AI眼镜以及仓库机器人。该公司周三公布了一套雄心勃勃的AI技术，旨在彻底改变其配送业务和仓库自动化。这与前几天传出的亚马逊计划在未来几年裁员60万人的消息相吻合。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amazon debuting their AI glasses for drivers along with warehouse robots. Amazon unveiled on Wednesday an ambitious suite of AI powered technologies designed to revolutionize both delivery operations and warehouse automation, including smart glasses for drivers and advanced robotic systems that could reshape the company's workforce. You know, you had that big headline the other day that Amazon is trying to get rid of 600,000 people over the next couple years.</p>
</details>

此外，英伟达和优步宣布合作推进自动驾驶汽车的开发。双方将利用优步庞大的真实世界驾驶数据，在英伟达的Cosmos平台上进行训练，结合合成数据与真实世界数据，以提高模拟的准确性、安全性和性能。

<details>

Cosmos is using their synthetic data in combination with real world data, improving simulation accuracy, safety, and performance in complex real world conditions.</p>
</details>

盘后最大的新闻之一是，Anthropic确认了与谷歌云的交易。Anthropic将扩大使用谷歌云的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌为加速机器学习工作负载而设计的专用集成电路）。Anthropic表示，该交易价值“数百亿美元”，计划使用多达100万个TPU。这一消息证实了之前的传闻，推动谷歌股价在盘后上涨。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Anthropic, they confirmed the deal. They confirmed the deal. Anthropic confirms Google Cloud deal. Anthropic to expand use of Google Cloud TPUs. Anthropic said deal is worth tens of billions of dollars. That is what we got. Wow. Two seconds ago. Anthropic confirming the rumor. Now, Google hit 258 last time that happened. Maybe Google gets back up there. Anthropic will train and serve clawed models with plans to access up to 1 million TPUs worth tens of billions of dollars. In total, Anthropic will have access to well over a gigawatt of capacity coming online in 2026.</p>
</details>

### Palantir CEO 专访：与 Lumen 达成战略合作

Palantir首席执行官Alex Karp在接受福克斯新闻采访时，谈到了与Lumen新达成的多年期、数百万美元的合作关系。Karp表示，虽然不评论具体交易金额，但这笔交易对Palantir而言具有“形成性”意义，是一项非常重要的合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alex, uh, this is a reported $200 million deal. Am we am I right on that? You know, we don't really comment on the specifics of deals. What I would say is um it is a formative deal for us. We are very very happy to be partnered with you.</p>
</details>

他解释说，Lumen拥有可以成为美国每个AI用例骨干的电信基础设施，而Palantir的产品将帮助Lumen在一年内（而非五年）完成业务转型，以支持AI带来的网络负担。转型之后，Palantir的平台将帮助Lumen利用实时数据创造价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She I mean she's what basically is happening is you have a business that if it can be transformed in in a couple in a in a year as opposed to 5 years could be the backbone of essentially every AI use case in the country. you have these somewhat older uh telco infrastructures that really can't support the burden that AI places on on the network and in her leadership they have a team that is just extremely aggressive in how do you transform this from A to B and there obviously our products are quite useful. So after you've transformed it, then you have you know after you can use the data in real time at scale given the ai load that's going to come then the question is what do you do with the data and then we're ideally suited for that.</p>
</details>

当被问及关于暂停开发超越人类认知能力的AI系统的呼吁时，Karp表示，他认为这是一场“军备竞赛”。要么我们拥有AI并制定规则，要么我们的对手拥有它并由他们来决定规则。因此，他认为像与Lumen合作这样的基础设施项目至关重要，Palantir正全力以赴支持能够巩固美国基础设施和国防能力的客户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, now we're moving into the portion that's just me and I don't like I like to I don't want to be but um the there's basically the way they look at it and the way I look at it which is my view uh not not anyone else's which is we're in a we're in a we're in an arms race here. This is that's all academic super academic. It's like we're going to either have AI and and determine the rules or our adversaries will have it and they'll determine the rules. And it and so this is why these infrastructure things are crazy important because in order to make it work, what do you need? You need infrastructure that can actually run the models, get the data there in a secure and cheap enough way. You need to make the models actually useful. You need ontology to do that. Meaning you have to deploy them where they're useful and where they're not and and orchestrate them. And if you start putting impediments on this, de facto, what's going to happen is our adversaries will build it and we will be buying everything from them, including our ideas of how to run our country. And so like my personal version, Palanteer, what we represent at Palanteer, what we do not impose on anyone else is we're running. We're running like hell and we're going to support anybody, especially people on the front line who can like galvanize this infrastructure and then our clients in the DoD especially and help make the American war fighter the most lethal in the world.</p>
</details>

### 宏观动态与市场情绪

在其他新闻方面，甲骨文公司（Oracle）即将完成一笔创纪录的380亿美元债务出售，用于资助其在德克萨斯州和威斯康星州的数据中心建设。这笔巨额融资再次凸显了市场对AI基础设施的巨大需求，也解释了为什么像Cipher和Bitfarms这样的数据中心概念股在盘后出现上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Record $ 38 billion debt sale near for Oracle data centers. Oh, I think that might be it. I think that might be it. That's why all the that that's actually why the Bitcoin miners are running. That's actually why uh record 38 billion. Wow. Yeah. Two minutes ago. 38 billion debt sale near. Wow. Did they actually sell 38 billion worth of corporate bonds? Did they actually sell almost 40 billion of corporate debt? Who the hell bought all their debt? Yeah, that's super bullish. Ian, Nebia, Cipher, Cororee, because that signals that if Oracle can get 40 billion of debt financed for guess what data centers, then all these other smaller companies that are not as big as Oracle are probably going to catch a bid for data centers.</p>
</details>

与此同时，零售巨头塔吉特（Target）宣布将在公司层面裁员1800人，约占其公司员工总数的8%。即将上任的CEO表示，此举旨在消除组织复杂性，让公司更快地重回增长轨道。这一消息引发了关于裁员是由于需求疲软还是AI提高效率的讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Target is going to be laying off about 1,800 people. Seeing that headline right here.

In the memo, he said, "The truth is the complexity we've created over time has been holding us back. Too many layers and overlapping work has slowed decisions, making it harder to bring ideas to life."</p>
