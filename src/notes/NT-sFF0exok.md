### 市场全面反弹，标普500逼近历史高位

大家好，欢迎回到市场收盘节目。我们有很多内容要谈。标普500指数正试图在收盘时达到历史最高点，我们基本上回到了两周前的位置，这很令人欣慰。标普500指数目前在67194点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We got a lot of stuff to talk about, folks. We got the S&P 500 that's trying to get to all-time highs on the close. We are basically back to where we were from two weeks ago, which is nice to see. 67194 right here on the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

你看到的不仅仅是标普指数的反弹，特斯拉也试图冲击448美元，而该股今早还在418美元。Palantir目前上涨3%。Robin Hood股价达到134.87美元，这对它来说是重要的一天。标普500指数当天上涨了6%。SoFi上涨4%，Grab达到5.70美元，谷歌上涨0.5%，AMD上涨1.6%，甚至亚马逊当天也突破220美元，达到221美元。Meta回到了735美元。这确实是相当不可思议的一天。SMCI的日子则比较难看，下跌了约9%。就连比特币表现也不差，今早还在106美元，现在回到了110美元。所以整个市场都出现了明显的反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you've got a rebound, not just on the S&P, but Tesla trying to go for 448. The stock was at 418 this morning. Palantir up 3% right now. Robin Hood 134.87. Big big day for Robin Hood. You got the S&P 500 again up 6% on the day. SoFi's up 4%. Grab got to 570. Google's up half a percent. AMD up 1.6. Even Amazon breaking 220 on the day at 221. Meta back at 735. I mean, it's been a pretty incredible day. SMCI a little bit more of an ugly day down about 9%. And even Bitcoin not doing too bad. Bitcoin was at 106 this morning, now back at 110. So you've seen an obvious rebound across the entire market.</p>
</details>

其他高质量成长股也表现不俗，比如CrowdStrike上涨4%，达到519美元；Coinbase上涨1.4%。那么，这一切发生的原因是什么呢？我们有一些头条新闻可以解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've got all the other names in terms of high quality growth like a CrowdStrike 519 that's up 4% of the day. Coinbase is up 1.4%. So the reason is why is this happening? And we actually have a bunch of different headlines to talk about for why this is happening across the entire board.</p>
</details>

我认为首要原因是卖家和空头可能已经有些筋疲力尽了。过去两周，整个市场都经历了艰难的抛售，尤其是高动能股，也包括像Meta、苹果、谷歌这样的大型科技股。现在你开始看到一些反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the number one reason is the sellers and the shorts probably got a bit exhausted. It has been a rough two weeks of selling across the board. Definitely for high driven momentum stocks also just random names like your average Meta, Apple, Google, right? All the big tech names that got hit and you're starting to see a little bit of rebound.</p>
</details>

其次，特朗普说了一些听起来相对乐观的话。大约一小时前，他确认了将于10月30日与习近平主席举行面对面会晤。这次会晤的正式确认也为市场注入了更多动力。他一宣布这个消息，市场就开始非常喜欢它，因为市场乐于看到谈判进展顺利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two is Trump is saying a bunch of stuff that seems relatively bullish. So the first thing he said about an hour ago was that he confirmed the October 30th meeting in person with President Xi. As a result of that meeting officially being confirmed, that is why you're also seeing some more momentum. The market as soon as he announced that started to really like it and you would imagine the market would like that because the market enjoys that the negotiations are going well.</p>
</details>

特朗普现在正在直播，他谈到了很多事情。他刚提到的其中一件事是，他接到了英伟达的黄仁勋关于旧金山的电话。中国会议定于10月30日举行，这恰好在联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议的后一天，也正好在他与世界其他官员（甚至可能包括金正恩）会晤的前一天。因此，下周的这次会晤将非常及时且重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was the first thing. Trump's live right now. He's saying a bunch of things. One of the quotes he just said was he got a call from Nvidia's Jensen Huang about San Francisco. One of the number one things is that the China meetings are set to go for October 30th, which is a day after the FOMC meeting and a day before he continues to have meetings with other officials across the world, potentially even Kim Jong-un. So that meeting is going to be very timely next week and very important in terms of seeing what that could actually do.</p>

### 市场热点追踪：量子计算与加密货币

量子计算概念股今天上午经历了一个有趣的行情。这些股票在盘前大幅上涨，但现在涨幅有所回落。D-Wave盘前曾上涨20%，现在涨幅为13%。雅虎财经的一篇报道称，美国政府并未与这些量子公司进行过对话，导致股价下跌。随后，Rigetti向CNBC表示：“我们正在进行对话”，并补充说，如果美国不投资我们，其他国家就会，美国将被甩在后面。接着，彭博社报道称，政府确实在与这些公司进行实质性对话。所以，没人确切知道发生了什么，但市场并没有给予它们盘前那么高的溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Quantum names have had a pretty interesting morning. So again, these guys were up a lot in the pre-markets. They're not up as much. D-Wave was up 20%, now it's up 13%. There was a report that came out by Yahoo Finance that said the United States government did not have conversations with these quantum companies. And so that's when they started falling. Then Rigetti gave a quote to CNBC and said, "We are having conversations and they added, by the way, if the US doesn't invest in us, then someone else will and the US is going to be left behind, which is not a good thing." And then you had Bloomberg report 20 minutes ago that no, no, they actually are legit having conversations with a bunch of these companies. So, I don't think anyone necessarily knows exactly what is happening for sure, but the market is not giving them the massive premium they had in the pre-market.</p>
</details>

与此同时，那些从比特币矿工转型为数据中心的公司表现出色。Cipher上涨5%，Riot也上涨了7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you have the Bitcoin miners turn data centers. Cipher's up 5%. Riot up 7% as well. And that's kind of what you got as we get into this market close.</p>
</details>

在我们等待收盘之际，值得关注的是盘后将公布财报的英特尔和福特。这两份财报将非常非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what do we have after the bell? We have Intel and Ford. Those are going to be very, very important earnings. Let me know in the chat if anyone owns those names.</p>
</details>

华尔街对英特尔的期望并不高，他们预计每股收益为1美分，营收为131.4亿美元。所以，任何高于这个数字的结果都会是好消息。英特尔大约在五个季度前取消了股息。该公司今年迄今已上涨了87%，所以他们搞砸的空间不大。但话又说回来，美国政府向他们注资了90亿美元。所以，谁知道呢？如果他们能拿出任何有意义的业绩，都可能让华尔街兴奋起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the street, it doesn't have the highest expectations for Intel. Intel Street wants 1 cent per share and 13.14 billion in revenue. So, they're not expecting too much. Anything above that would be good. Intel again did get rid of their dividend about five quarters ago. So, question is just going to be what they can put up on these results. It's up, yeah, 87% year-to date. I mean, they don't really have room to mess up. But then again, the US government pumped 9 billion into them. So, I mean, who knows? If they can put up any level of meaningful results, that would get the street excited.</p>
</details>

另外一个数据点是**货币市场基金**（Money Market Funds: 投资于短期、低风险债务工具的共同基金）。上周我们看到资金减少了150亿美元，而本周的数据显示，货币市场基金规模增加了300亿美元，总额达到7.4万亿美元。这表明仍有大量资金处于观望状态，人们仍然希望获得无风险的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, money market funds. We have the results. Last week we had a decrease in money market funds by 15 billion. We have the updated numbers here. The answer is officially increased. Money market funds increase by 30 billion as you can see right there to 7.4 trillion. It shows that people still want a return that is not going to be risking anything and as a result of that return not risking anything that is why you have these money market funds getting to these levels 7.4 trillion.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头动态：亚马逊、英伟达与谷歌的新动向

在收盘前，我们还有几条科技新闻。亚马逊推出了面向司机的AI眼镜和仓库机器人。周三，亚马逊发布了一套雄心勃勃的AI技术，旨在彻底改变其配送业务和仓库自动化，包括为司机配备的智能眼镜和可能重塑公司劳动力的先进机器人系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon debuting their AI glasses for drivers along with warehouse robots. Amazon unveiled on Wednesday an ambitious suite of AI powered technologies designed to revolutionize both delivery operations and warehouse automation, including smart glasses for drivers and advanced robotic systems that could reshape the company's workforce.</p>
</details>

此外，英伟达和优步宣布将合作推进自动驾驶汽车的开发。双方将利用优步庞大的真实世界驾驶数据，在英伟达的Cosmos平台上进行训练。Cosmos平台结合了合成数据与真实世界数据，旨在提高模拟的准确性、安全性和在复杂真实世界条件下的性能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, Nvidia and Uber, I should say, announced that they are working together to advance autonomous vehicle development. The two are using Uber's large real-world driving data to post train on Nvidia's Cosmos platform. Cosmos is using their synthetic data in combination with real world data, improving simulation accuracy, safety, and performance in complex real world conditions.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报速递：英特尔惊艳全场，福特喜忧参半

收盘了，标普指数收于67160点，这是一个非常好的收盘价。现在我们来看看英特尔的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, there we go. We are done for the day. S&P 67160. Great close. Great great close after a really choppy first few days of this week getting back into the 670s and actually closing above 670. Very nice to see. All right, Intel earnings. I think we're going to get them.</p>
</details>

哇！英特尔的业绩太惊人了。他们每股收益（EPS）超出预期2000%！具体数字是23美分，而预期仅为1美分。营收为136亿美元，也高于131.4亿美元的预期。这看起来是真实的数据，多家信源都在确认。这真是一个巨大的胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, wow. Okay. Hold on. Is this accurate? What I'm looking at is they beat EPS by 2,000%. 23 cents versus 1 cent expected. 13.6 billion versus 13.14. Trying to confirm if they actually did. Yeah, that looks like the number. It looks like they beat by 2,000%. Dude, that's a big beat. 23 cents a share. Are you kidding me? When the street was expecting 1 cent. That's a big beat.</p>
</details>

更多细节显示，英特尔第三季度毛利率为40%，高于预期的36%。数据中心业务营收为41.2亿美元，高于预期的39.7亿美元；客户端计算业务营收为84亿美元，高于预期的81亿美元。不过，**晶圆代工**（Foundry: 指专门从事半导体晶圆制造，接受其他公司委托制造芯片的业务模式）业务营收为42亿美元，低于预期的45亿美元。尽管如此，股价还是应声上涨，突破了40美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh gross margins 40% on Intel in the third quarter versus 36% expected. That's a hell of a beat by 4%. Fourth quarter revenue, they're guiding for 12.8 to 13.8. Data center revenue 4.12 versus 3.97. That's a beat. Client computing revenue 8.4 versus 8.1. That's a beat. Foundry revenue 4.2 versus 4.5. That's a miss. They missed on Foundry. They beat on client computing. They beat on data center. There it goes. 40. There you go. 40 bucks.</p>
</details>

CNBC的报道中，英特尔首席财务官Dave Zinsner提到，由于数据中心更新换代的速度“快于预期”，他们目前面临供应短缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I caught up with Intel CFO Dave Zinsner just moments ago and he told me that they are pretty short on supply because the data center refresh is happening quote faster than anticipated. They met demand with inventory on hand and he's saying that they're going to be behind in Q1, probably Q2, maybe even Q3 because of this supply crunch.</p>
</details>

接下来是福特的财报。福特每股收益超出预期25%，营收超出7%，业绩不错。然而，尽管业绩超预期，其股价却下跌了4%。原因是他们下调了调整后自由现金流的指引，并且对2026财年的调整后EBITDA预期也低于华尔街的预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ford, uh, I think we have a beat on Ford, folks. Ford is down 4%. Ford, yeah, beat by 25% on EPS, beat by 7% on revenue, 45 cents versus 36 cents. Stock is down 4% right here. Uh they see their adjusted free cash flow two to three billion instead of 3.5 to four. So I guess that's a little lower than expected. And then Street wanted 7.5 billion of adjusted Ebida for fiscal year 26. They're coming at 6.5 billion. Again, not the worst miss, but nonetheless, that's probably explaining why Ford is getting hit right there.</p>
</details>

其他公司的财报也纷纷出炉，Deckers、Newmont和Digital Realty Trust (DLR) 都实现了超预期的业绩，其中DLR的每股收益更是惊人地超出了510%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Deckers is down. Top and the bottom beat by 15%. Pneumont that one is up after hours. Wow, another double beat. 19% EPS 5% revenue beat. Digital Realy Trust, that's up 3.82%. Wow. $510% EPS beat.</p>
</details>

从这些公司普遍超出预期的EPS来看，一个快速的结论是它们的利润率可能正在改善，好于华尔街的预期。利润率的改善很可能归功于两个字母：A和I（人工智能）。如果这个趋势在整个财报季持续，那就意味着AI正在创造利润改善，这或许能解释为什么标普500指数的估值正在扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the quick takeaway real quick from all these companies that are beating on EPS is that their margins are probably getting better. Better than what the street thought, which is why they're able to beat these numbers, margins getting better is likely because of two letters, A and I. And if that is true, and we hear a lot of that commentary throughout this earning cycle on these calls, then AI is creating margin improvement, aka it should be expanding the overall multiple on the S&P or at least make sense of why the multiple on the S&P is getting extended.</p>
</details>

盘后又传来重磅消息：Anthropic确认了与谷歌云的交易。Anthropic将扩大使用谷歌云的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌为加速机器学习计算而设计的专用集成电路）。Anthropic表示，该交易价值“数百亿美元”。消息传出后，谷歌股价在盘后进一步上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthropic, they confirmed the deal. Anthropic confirms Google Cloud deal. Anthropic to expand use of Google Cloud TPUs. Anthropic said deal is worth tens of billions of dollars. That is what we got. Wow. Anthropic will train and serve Claude models with plans to access up to 1 million TPUs worth tens of billions of dollars. Google now moving a little bit more.</p>
</details>

### Palantir CEO 专访：解读与 Lumen 的战略合作

Palantir首席执行官Alex Karp和Lumen总裁兼首席执行官Kate Johnson接受了采访，讨论了双方新宣布的多年期、数百万美元的合作。他们将部署Palantir的AI平台，以加速和增强Lumen的数字网络基础设施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palantir CEO Alex Karp and he is here with Kate Johnson, president and CEO of Lumen. Palantir and Lumen just announced an expanded multi-year multi-million dollar partnership to deploy Palantir's AI to fast-track and enhance Lumen's digital networking infrastructure.</p>
</details>

当被问及这笔交易是否价值2亿美元时，Karp没有正面评论具体数字，但他表示：“这对我们来说是一笔具有里程碑意义的交易。我们非常高兴能与你们合作。”他解释说，Lumen的业务如果能在一年内而不是五年内完成转型，就有可能成为美国每个AI用例的支柱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alex, uh, this is a reported $200 million deal. Am I right on that? You know, we don't really comment on the specifics of deals. What I would say is it is a formative deal for us. We are very very happy to be partnered with you. She basically is happening is you have a business that if it can be transformed in a in a couple in a in a year as opposed to 5 years could be the backbone of essentially every AI use case in the country.</p>
</details>

Karp进一步阐述了Palantir的价值，尤其是在AI时代。他提到了**本体**（Ontology: 在 Palantir 的语境中，这是一个数字孪生模型，能将组织的各类数据、逻辑和操作整合在一起，形成一个统一的决策基础）的重要性，认为你需要本体和芯片来让AI发挥作用。他还强调了美国在AI领域的领导地位，认为这是一场“军备竞赛”，要么我们制定规则，要么我们的对手来制定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We believe you need ontology and uh and and chips to make this work. We supply the ontology. There's basically the way they look at it and the way I look at it which is we're in a we're in an arms race here. It's like we're going to either have AI and and determine the rules or our adversaries will have it and they'll determine the rules. And so this is why these infrastructure things are crazy important.</p>
</details>

### 尾声：甲骨文巨额发债引爆数据中心板块

在节目尾声，一条重磅新闻引爆了市场：甲骨文（Oracle）即将完成一笔创纪录的380亿美元债务出售，用于资助其数据中心建设。这笔资金将用于在德克萨斯州和威斯康星州建设由Vantage Data Centers开发的数据中心，这些数据中心同时为甲骨文和OpenAI服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Record $38 billion debt sale near for Oracle data centers. Oh, I think that might be it. That's why all the Bitcoin miners are running. record 38 billion. Wow. Yeah. Two minutes ago. 38 billion debt sale near. Vantage Data Centers is developing both data centers which are used by Oracle and OpenAI.</p>
</details>

这则消息极大地提振了市场对数据中心领域的信心。如果像甲骨文这样的巨头能够为其数据中心项目融资近400亿美元，那么所有其他规模较小、专注于数据中心的公司也可能会受到追捧。消息公布后，与数据中心相关的股票，包括那些从比特币挖矿转型的公司，如Cipher和Bitfarms，股价在盘后大幅上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's super bullish. Ian, Nebia, Cipher, Cororee, because that signals that if Oracle can get 40 billion of debt financed for guess what data centers, then all these other smaller companies that are not as big as Oracle are probably going to catch a bid for data centers.</p>
</details>
