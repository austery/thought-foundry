### 乐高：激发未来建造者的品牌使命

大家好。今天，我们将探索世界上最受欢迎的品牌之一——**乐高**（LEGO: 一家丹麦玩具公司，以其塑料拼搭积木闻名）的基石。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everyone. Today we are exploring the building blocks of one of the world's most beloved brands, LEGO.</p>
</details>

我与自2017年起领导乐高的尼尔斯·B·克里斯蒂安森（Niels B. Christiansen）在此。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm here with Nils Christianen who's led LEGO since 2017.</p>
</details>

我们将了解他们卓越的商业模式以及这家公司如此特别的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we are going to learn about their remarkable business model and what makes this company so special.</p>
</details>

热烈欢迎尼尔森。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So warm welcome Nilson.</p>
</details>

非常感谢。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you very much.</p>
</details>

上周末，我乘坐火车从挪威山区下来，碰巧坐在一位女士旁边。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I was on I was on the train last weekend down from the Norwegian mountains and I happened to sit next to this lady</p>
</details>

我当时正在为这次播客做准备，于是问她：“嘿，你有什么想问乐高CEO的问题吗？”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was preparing for this for this podcast and I asked her, "Hey, what would you what do you want to ask the CEO of Lego?"</p>
</details>

她听后完全沉默了，然后说：“如果你见到乐高CEO，你一定要感谢他，因为他让我的16岁儿子对工程学产生了兴趣。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then she went completely silent and she said, "If you meet the CEO of Lego, you have to thank him for having made my 16-year-old son interested in engineering."</p>
</details>

太棒了。所以，我代表她和数百万其他人，感谢您所做的一切。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fantastic. So on behalf of her and millions of others, you know, thank you for what you have done.</p>
</details>

这真是不可思议。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's incredible.</p>
</details>

那么，我们从头开始吧。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's just start at the top.</p>
</details>

您所说的“激励和培养未来的建造者”究竟意味着什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does it really mean to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow because that's what you say you're doing.</p>
</details>

是的，这当然始于儿童，我们相信儿童是我们的榜样，他们以创造性的方式探索世界。我们知道，我们提供的产品确实能帮助儿童获得在社会中生活所需的一些基本技能，这些技能比我们在学校教授的更为基础。我认为我们多年来学到的东西不仅适用于儿童，也适用于我们所有人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it of course takes the outset in children and we believe that children are our role models in the way they do the creative way they attack the world and we know that we actually provide something that helps children acquire some of the skills they need to live in society more basic skills that what we actually teach children in school and I think what we learned over the years that's very applicable to children but it's applicable to all of us.</p>
</details>

为什么他们喜欢建造东西？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do they love building things?</p>
</details>

嗯，是的，我想这关乎我们人类与生俱来的创造力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I guess it's about this in it's about the creativity I think that's built into us people.</p>
</details>

我认为，从五千年前我们用石头制作锤子开始，人类就有了这种创造事物的渴望和动力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think everything from when we back 5,000 years ago we were making a hammer out of stone where this desire and drive to create things.</p>
</details>

我认为这正是乐高积木所提供的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this is what legal bricks provide.</p>
</details>

今天我在你们工厂参观时学到了一个新词。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I learned a new expression today when I walked around in your factory.</p>
</details>

**咬合力**（Clutch power: 乐高积木之间连接的强度）。是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Clutch power. Yes.</p>
</details>

积木以这种方式连接在一起，这种咬合力一定非常令人满意。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The way that bricks kind of fit together, there must be something very satisfactory with the clutch power.</p>
</details>

父母的影响有多重要？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is the parents influence?</p>
</details>

我们的成长伴随着积木，这种影响是如何代代相传的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean we were brought up with bricks just in what way does it go in generations?</p>
</details>

是的，这对于孩子来说很重要，但对于成年人来说则不那么重要，因为我们现在也向所有消费者销售产品。但对于孩子而言，成年人通常是最好的“大使”，他们会带来第一套乐高积木。我们知道，成年人和孩子一起拼搭对双方都非常有益且令人兴奋。因此，很明显，在一些国家，比如你和我作为斯堪的纳维亚人，童年时都有幸玩过乐高积木，这带来了巨大的优势。但在亚洲，尤其是在中国和印度，情况并非如此。所以，在某些地区，父母几乎是天然的品牌大使，而在其他地区，我们则需要逐步建立品牌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it is important for the kids part, it's less important for the adult part because we do sell to all consumers today. But for kids, adults are typically the best ambassador to bring the first legal brick set in. We know that building together adult and kid is very developing and very exciting actually for both parties. So obviously, following that, there is a big advantage in the countries where, I mean, I guess you and I being Scandinavians have had the pleasure of playing with Lego bricks when we were children. That's not the case everywhere, particularly in Asia, in China, in India, it wasn't necessarily like that. So in some parts, you almost have parents as a natural ambassador. In other parts, we are building the brand as we go.</p>
</details>

嗯，所以这其中存在差异，但它极其重要。你提到旁边那位女士的故事很有趣，我可能是收到最多来自孩子和家长邮件和信件的CEO之一。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there's a difference there, but it's super important. It's interesting when you said the lady you were sitting next to, I am probably one of the CEOs who gets most emails and letters from kids and parents.</p>
</details>

就在过去24小时内，我收到了三封感谢信，感谢我们所做的一切，他们回忆起自己童年时的经历，并告诉我这对他们的孩子或孙辈来说是多么棒。这真的非常令人欣慰。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just within the last 24 hours, I've had three thanking me for what we do, reminding them of what they did as kids and telling me how that has been fantastic for their children or grandchildren, and it's super rewarding.</p>
</details>

乐高品牌意味着什么？它涵盖了什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does a brand What does a Lego brand mean? What does it encompass?</p>
</details>

是的，它在某种意义上涵盖了我们的价值观。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean it encompasses our values in a sense.</p>
</details>

所以，它包含了很多创造力、想象力，还有一种媒介，你可以用它来表达你想做的一切，或者以不同的方式表达自己。它几乎就像写作一样，你可以用乐高积木来做你想做的事情，你创造的作品就是你的作品。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a lot of creativity, there's imagination, there's kind of this, yeah, I consider it a medium with which you can impress everything you want to do or express yourself in a different way, or it's almost like something, it's like writing in a sense, you can use the Lego bricks for what you want to do and the creation you make is your creation.</p>
</details>

从这个意义上说，它不是乐高公司创造的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not a Lego creation in that sense.</p>
</details>

所以我认为它允许这种自由，品牌也涵盖了所有这些。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it allows for that and the brand encompasses all that.</p>
</details>

世界上现在有多少块乐高积木？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many Lego bricks are there in the world now?</p>
</details>

哦，这是个好问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, that's a good question.</p>
</details>

我想大概在5000亿到10000亿块之间。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Somewhere I think between 500 billion and a thousand billion.</p>
</details>

这是个庞大的数字。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a big number.</p>
</details>

是的，这是个庞大的数字。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's a big number.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，当你得到一套新积木时，你总能把它和你已有的积木结合起来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fun thing is when you get a new set, you kind of add on what you already have.</p>
</details>

所以，在某种程度上，它就像一个飞轮或者一个平台。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have this kind of, you know, in a way it's a flywheel or kind of a platform.</p>
</details>

是的，没错。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly.</p>
</details>

它就是一个平台。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a platform.</p>
</details>

我认为乐高积木实际上是终极平台或终极模块化系统。我的意思是，每家公司都在讨论如何将事物平台化以提高效率。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I consider Lego bricks actually being the ultimate platform or the ultimate modular system, and I mean every company talking about how can we platformize things to make those more efficient.</p>
</details>

他们总是用乐高积木作为这方面的例子。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They always use the Lego bricks as the example for that.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这深深植根于我们的理念中，即我们所做的一切最好都能从模块化的角度进行优化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that that sits very deeply in our roots, of course, that everything we do better be optimized from a modularity point of view.</p>
</details>

### 数字时代的挑战与机遇

是的。现在，孩子们玩耍的方式变了。这种数字成瘾如何影响你们的业务？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Now kids change the way they spend their time. Just how does this digital addiction impact your business?</p>
</details>

嗯，我的意思是，这使得保持相关性变得更加困难，因为归根结底，我们实际上是在争夺孩子们的时间。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's I mean it makes it harder to stay relevant because at the end of the day we are actually we consider ourselves competing for children's time.</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

不仅仅是作为玩具竞争。你说得对，我的意思是，全球许多国家的孩子花更多时间在学校，放学后他们通常会玩平板电脑或电脑。所以，要在这方面保持相关性，游戏变得更难了。我们知道，当孩子们真正投入其中时，他们会非常兴奋。我们知道家长们喜欢它，我们也知道所有重要的发展标准。你需要协调地运用大脑和双手来建造，这些隐喻性的技能能更早地在大脑中建立正确的连接。我们知道这一点，我认为我们正是实现这一目标的最佳工具。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More than just competing as a toy. And you're right. I mean children actually in many countries around the globe they spend more time on school. They spend time on after school whenever they're off that they're typically on a tablet or a computer and so so it's it's it's just a harder game to stay relevant on that. We know then when kids really get into it they get super excited. We know parents like it and we know all the important development criteria. You have to use your brain and your hand in a coordinated way to build that these methorical skills to build the right connections in the brain earlier on. We know that and I think we are we're just a prime tool for doing that.</p>
</details>

那么，您认为孩子们的幻想和想象力有所改变吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, do you think something has changed with children's fantasy and imagination?</p>
</details>

到目前为止？没有，没有太大变化。我认为这是一个积极的方面，而且我也认为我们必须承认，使用数字屏幕并非坏事。它只是不能成为你唯一做的事情。我们通常会发现，如果你像我之前说的那样，把一大桶乐高积木倒在地板上，孩子们会像你我当年那样去拼搭。这并没有太大不同，我认为这相当令人鼓舞。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far? Not not a lot. Which is a positive I think and and I also think we have to we have to also have to say that being on digital screens is not bad. It just cannot be the only thing you do. We typically see if you do do what you said before, you take this big bin of Lego bricks, you throw them on the on the floor, kids will build like you and I would build back then. It's not that different, which I think is quite encouraging.</p>
</details>

是的。但你们也通过数字世界进行互动。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But you also interact via the digital world.</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

通过你们的乐高产品，对吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With your legal products, right?</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

你们都做些什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What kind of things do you do?</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，如果你考虑到争夺时间，你希望保持相关性。你不能只做一个乐高品牌，然后说我们只存在于实体世界，因为那已经过时了。所以你必须出现在孩子们和消费者所在的地方。我们有游戏，我们有乐高玩乐社交媒体平台，我们有很多**IP**（Intellectual Property: 知识产权）合作伙伴，我们也在数字领域进行大量合作，因为孩子们需要这些。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's if you think about competing for time, you want to be relevant. You cannot kind of be a Lego brand and then say we are only in the physical world because that that's over. So you want to be where kids are and where where consumers are. So we have we have games, we have we have a Lego play social media platforms, we have a lot of IP partners where we also work very heavily into digital because kids want that.</p>
</details>

但他们当然期望乐高品牌在数字世界中的呈现是真实的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they expect of course and representation in digital of the LEGO brand that is authentic to what it is.</p>
</details>

这就是我们的挑战，确保我们以正确的方式、秉持正确的价值观出现，无论是在数字世界还是实体世界。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's our challenge to make sure we show up the right way with the right values no matter whether it's in digital or or physical.</p>
</details>

### 创意驱动：产品开发与设计文化

在你们自己的产品开发中，你们如何培养创造力？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In your own product development. How do you foster creativity?</p>
</details>

这总是让我笑容满面，因为我们是一家极具创造力的公司。如果你有机会和我们乐高设计师部门的人一起走走，我的意思是……
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That brings a smile to my face all the time because we are a super creative company. And if there's something if you get the opportunity to walk alongside the department we have of Lego designers. I mean</p>
</details>

你们有多少人？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many people do you have?</p>
</details>

我们有大约600名设计师。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have I think we have around 600 designers.</p>
</details>

哦，哇。他们是如何决定要做什么的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh wow. And how do they how do they how do they go about figuring out what to make?</p>
</details>

是的，我的意思是方法非常多样，因为我们有各种各样的人，从受过专业训练的设计师到建筑师再到工程师。成为乐高设计师几乎是每个人都渴望的目标，你真的愿意为此投入，人们会为此努力多年以达到这种技能水平。如果你是一名乐高设计师，你就会在这个小镇工作。所以你会在丹麦日德兰半岛中部这个地方工作，因为我们没有其他地方的乐高设计师。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean very different approaches because you would have everything from designers or trained designers to architects to engineers, all kinds of people. It's almost like it's I mean a Lego designer that's something you really want to be and you are really willing to lean into that and people work for years to to to get to that skill and if you're Lego designer you work in this town. So you work in this place in the middle of Jutland in Denmark because we have liquid designers nowhere else.</p>
</details>

因为这个小镇是比隆（Billund）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because this town is billand.</p>
</details>

在丹麦中部。你们有多少居民？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the middle middle of Denmark. And how many citizens have you got?</p>
</details>

镇上大概有1万人，其中6000人为我们工作。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Probably 10,000 in the town and 6,000 people working for us.</p>
</details>

不，我的意思是，我们把设计师们聚集在一起。这样你就能真正创造出一种极具创造力的氛围，他们可以相互协作，我们也能以最好的方式支持他们。我的意思是，他们每天都能接触到现有的每一块乐高积木，每一种颜色。他们拥有各种支持系统，以及这种极具创造力的环境，让他们能够发挥创造力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, but the point is just we have we have the designers together. So you really create this super creative atmosphere where they can work up along each other where we can support them in the best possible way. I mean they have access every day to every single Lego brick that exists in every single color. They have all kinds of systems supporting and they have this very creative environment that that allows them to to to be creative.</p>
</details>

你们如何创造这种环境？需要什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you how do you create that environment? What does it take?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这其中有一部分是物理建筑，它需要令人兴奋，这也是我们正在进一步发展的领域。但更重要的是你给予他们的自由。所以，如果你找到了合适的人，并允许他们在工作中发挥创造力，我们并不会过多地控制他们。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean there's a there's a physical building part to that that needs to be need needs to be exciting and that's an area we're actually even moving further on. But it's that also the freedom you give them. So you if you get the right type of people and you allow them to be creative in what they do. So we don't control them much. We I mean</p>
</details>

那是一个真正的游乐场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a play it's a proper playground.</p>
</details>

是的，每两周他们有一天可以完全按照自己的意愿行事，不受任何项目限制。我们确实需要推出产品，但我们需要让他们随时都能产生并表达自己的想法。所以，这是一个非常令人兴奋的领域，它非常具有创造性，公司里有很多非常有创造力的人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is every two weeks they have a day where they can do exactly what they want to outside any program. We do get have to get products out the door, but we need to allow them to all the time have their ideas come up and come out and so it's it's quite an exciting area to be in and it's it's yeah it is very creative and there's a lot of very creative people in the company and</p>
</details>

生活中好的想法通常从何而来？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where do where do good ideas come from generally in life?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，它们可以来自很多地方，但我认为它们受到自身热情或自身建造技术的启发。是的。也可以受到我们对世界趋势的观察的启发。我的意思是，**一级方程式**（Formula 1: 国际汽车大奖赛）——我们与一级方程式有战略合作关系。是的，我们一直有车辆系列，但现在突然间，这为一些设计师或孩子们打开了一个世界，如果你对这些感兴趣。你可以围绕一个主题进行创作，但你也可以自由创作。桌上的花朵，我的意思是，那是一个开放式的创作。我第一次看到它时，甚至不确定那是否是个好主意。但是，它就是出自一位设计师之手。他们尝试了一下，我们说：“好吧，让我们试试看，如果成功了，我们就多做一些；如果不行，我们就会停止。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean they can come from many many places but I think they get inspired by by their own passions or their own type of building technique. Yeah. Can also be inspired by us looking into what are the trends in the world. I mean Formula 1, we have a strategic partnership with Formula 1. Yes, we've been in vehicles, but now suddenly that opens up a world for some designers or animals for for kids if you know you're into that. You can you can be a creative around a theme, but you can also be openly creative. And the flowers we see on the table, I mean, that's an open creation. The first time I saw that, I wasn't even certain whether that would be a good idea or not. But but that just came out of a designer. They tried it out and we said, "Okay, let's try it and if it works, we'll do more and if it doesn't, we would we would stop this in this case."</p>
</details>

是的。我能说的是，去看看你们这里的花卉创作吧，因为我正在考虑把一些放在我的办公室里，而不是鲜花。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. What I can say is that check out the floral creations you had here cuz I'm thinking about putting some in my office instead of flowers.</p>
</details>

非常酷。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very cool.</p>
</details>

嗯，现在您个人也参与其中，并批准产品等等。整个过程是如何运作的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um now you personally are involved and you are approving products and so on. this how how does how does this whole process work?</p>
</details>

是的，这很有趣，因为你谈到，我的意思是，我先说一下，我们每年会更换50%的产品线。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's because it's interesting when you talk I mean you and maybe I start with saying every year we change 50% of our product line.</p>
</details>

是的。那有多少？几百个？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And that's how many that's how many hundreds.</p>
</details>

那大概是每年400或450种产品。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's that would be around 400 now or 450 products that have to come every year.</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

而且，没有多少公司每两年就更换一次产品系列。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And not many companies change their product range every two years.</p>
</details>

没有。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No.</p>
</details>

没有。所以你可以说，我们任何时候的竞争力都取决于我们现在所展现的创造力。所以，我们谈到了创造性的一面，以及我们为让他们能够极具创造力所做的一些事情，但如果你从想法到产品的角度来看，创造性过程也相当结构化。我们有我们称之为P会议的会议。所以我们全年会有一系列P会议，我们召集很多人一起，试图弄清楚我们现有的想法和概念如何与世界趋势相契合？是一级方程式有吸引力吗？是今年上映新电影的《星球大战》吗？是什么会真正吸引注意力？是**宝可梦**（Pokémon: 日本任天堂公司开发的跨媒体系列）吗？是**超级马力欧**（Super Mario: 任天堂公司开发的经典电子游戏系列）吗？哪些是热门的IP，或者未来一两年会成为热门IP？

<p class="english-text">No. So you can say we we're no better at any point in time than the creativity we are coming out with right now. So we talked about the creative side and kind of some of the things we do to to allow them to be super creative but the creative process if you look at it from the idea to the product is also quite structured. So we have we call them P meetings. So we have a series of P meetings throughout the year where we bring a lot of people together trying to figure out how does how do the ideas we have and the and the concepts we have how do this play up against what are the trends in the world? What's is it Formula Formula 1 that's attractive? Is it Star Wars this year that's coming out with a new movie? What is it that would really drive attention? Is it Pokémon? Is it Super Mario? What are the things that are hot IPs or will be hot IPs one or two years out?</p>

你们会和孩子们确认吗？

<p class="english-text">Do you check with kids?</p>
</details>

我们和孩子们确认。我们和孩子们做了很多确认。我们也和成年人确认。然后当然，鉴于品牌的实力，我们与许多品牌和IP有着非常强大的合作关系。这也给了我们洞察未来趋势的特权。所以，如果你知道未来一两年会有哪些电影上映，你就能更有机会在优先级上做出正确的选择。
<details>

<p class="english-text">We check with kids. We check a lot with kids. We check with adults. And then of course we have given the strength of the brand, we have very strong cooperations with a lot of brands and IPs out there. And that gives us also the privilege of having insights into what is coming. So if you know what the movie slates are that will be there in the next year or two, you have a much better chance of hitting hitting right on your prioritization.</p>

有没有一些你们会永远保留的模型？你们有常青款吗？
<details>

<p class="english-text">Are there some models you keep forever? Do you have some evergreens?</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

是的。它们是什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. What are they?</p>
</details>

我举个例子，比如**泰坦尼克号**（Titanic: 乐高积木套装）。我们有泰坦尼克号。你需要用几千块积木来建造它。你把里面的一切都建造好，然后把它合上，只有你知道里面有什么。它大概有这么大。
<details>

<p class="english-text">I take a an example would be Titanic. So we have the Titanic. You build that from several thousand bricks. You build everything in there and you close it down so only you know what's inside. It's kind of this size.</p>
</details>

所以这是一个很大的套装。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's a it's a big set.</p>
</details>

超过一米。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More than a meter.</p>
</details>

是的。那是一个常青款，会存在很长时间。我不会说它永远不会过时，但它不是那种在一两年内就会进进出出的产品，不像大多数产品那样。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And that's something that that I mean that's that's an evergreen that will stay for a long long time. I won't say it would ever not ever go out, but it's not something that goes in and out in a year or two as most products would do.</p>
</details>

你们最复杂的套装是什么？有多少块积木？
<details>

哇。你提到了《星球大战》城市什么的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. You said the Star Wars city or something.</p>
</details>

是的，那会是一个巨大的。不，**《星球大战》千年隼号**（Star Wars Millennium Falcon: 乐高积木套装）会是一个大套装。**罗马斗兽场**（Colosseum: 乐高积木套装）会是一个大套装。**埃菲尔铁塔**（Eiffel Tower: 乐高积木套装）是一个非常大的套装。泰坦尼克号也是一个大套装。所以这些都会像你说的，有一米或一米半高，是非常大的建筑，里面有很多积木。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it would be a huge No, it would be a Star Wars Millennium Falcon would be a big one. The Colosum would be a big one. The Eiffel Tower is a very big one.

以前，男孩比女孩更喜欢乐高。现在你们设法改变了一点。

<p class="english-text">In the old days more boys than girls were into Lego. Now that you have managed to change that a bit.</p>
</details>

是的。现在我们非常注重成为一个适合所有人的品牌。所以，它既适合男孩也适合女孩，也适合青少年和成年人。但你说得对，今天我们在男孩和女孩之间的平衡性要好得多。

### 家族企业文化与领导力

谈到所有权和文化。乐高是一家家族企业。这如何影响你们的工作方式？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to ownership and culture. So, uh, LEGO is a family-owned company. How does that impact the way you work?</p>
</details>

是的，没错。我们作为家族企业已经有93年了。同一个家族，第一代。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Right. We've been familyowned for for 90 93 years. Same family, first generation.</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

嗯，它让我们有机会以更长远的视角做出决策。所以我们可以推行一些投资项目，有时也可以承受季度中一些小的波动或挫折。我的意思是，如果你想非常有创造力，你就会想冒险，并不是所有的尝试都会成功，如果发生这种情况，你不应该恐慌。你需要能够坚持下去。我认为我们在这方面有很多很好的例子，我们通过在某些计划中采取相当长远的视角来利用这一点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, it um uh it gives us an opportunity to take decisions with a slightly longer perspective. So we can carry through some investment programs and we can also sometimes carry through uh smaller smaller blips or hiccups in a quarter. So I mean if you want to be very creative, you want to take some chances and not everything pays out and you shouldn't panic if that happens. You need to be able to stand through that. I think I think we've had good examples of uh of doing that and we we are using that by actually also having quite quite a long perspective in some of our plans.</p>
</details>

是的。因为我们可以与家族所有者签订一些长期协议。我认为这是最大的优势。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. because we can sign up we can sign up with an owner family um for the longer term on some of those things. I think that's been the biggest uh biggest advantage.</p>
</details>

是的。不过你们确实经历了一段比较艰难的时期。那时发生了什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You did go through a period though where you which was a bit more rocky. What happened then?</p>
</details>

不，我认为，我的意思是，我们谈到了创造性的一面。你可以想象，有这么多有创造力的人四处奔波，如果你不小心，在很短的时间内就会产生很多复杂性。我认为我们经历过一些时期，复杂性增长过快，这当然使得以正确的方式执行和控制所有事情变得更加困难。所以，这是我们一直在做的事情之一，它也占据了我很多精力，需要在保持创造性的同时，也要非常结构化地运用运营模式，使我们能够每年生产出数十亿块积木，并确保所有这些套装、所有这些发布都能恰到好处。这实际上是两者之间的平衡，如果这种平衡被打破，通常就会给我们带来问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I think the um I mean we talked about the creative side. You can imagine with so many creative people running around you can create a lot of complexity in very short term if you're not if you if you're not careful. And I think we've had periods where where the complexity had grown too much and and that of course makes it more difficult to execute in the right way and and to control all things. So that's one of the things that we are that we all the time or it also takes a lot of my focus balancing between being creative but also being very structured with an operating model that allows us to execute these many billions of of of bricks that we need to get out and that all of these sets every year all these launches that they hit just right and do that that actually is a balance between the two things and if that gets out of balance that typically creates problem for us.</p>
</details>

是的。你们经历了多少年的问题？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. How many years did you have problems for?</p>
</details>

我们在2000年左右，我认为有一段五、六、七年的时期，在2016、17年左右，我们经历了大约两年的时期，失去了发展势头，然后才恢复过来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had in the around year 2000 I think there was a period of five or six or seven years around 16 17 it was kind of a two year a 2-year period where we lost momentum before we came we came back.</p>
</details>

现在你们真的强势回归了，对吧？所以过去几年你们的增长率接近15%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now you have really come back with a vengeance right so you've been growing close to 15% for the last few years.</p>
</details>

是的，在一个相当平稳的行业中，这是一个非常非常高的增长率，对吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's a very very high growth rate in a pretty flat industry, right?</p>
</details>

是的，没错。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, exactly.</p>
</details>

一家公司能以多快的速度增长？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How how what do you think is the fastest a company could grow?</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

以一种合理的方式。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh in a in a kind of sensible way.</p>
</details>

是的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

嗯，这是一个非常好的问题，因为这有点像你问题中问到的上限，即增长速度是否有合理的限制。另一方面，也有一个下限，因为在我们这样的业务中，它实际上是一个势头业务。如果我们能以适当的速度增长，我们就能负担得起所有那些前瞻性投资，这些投资将再次推动增长。我曾经请一位顾问进来，对哪些项目推动增长进行了更分析性的研究。高增长的最佳预测指标是我们在前一年也实现了快速增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's it's a super good question because that's kind of that's kind of the upper limit your question asking there is there a limit to how fast it makes sense to grow. On the other side, there's also a lower limit in the sense that in a business like ours, it's really a momentum business. If we can grow at a decent pace, we can afford to make all the forward-looking investments that will drive that that again. I actually once made a had a consultant come in making more of an analytical exercise on what projects the growth. The best projector of high growth is that we grew fast the year before.</p>
</details>

对，对。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right.</p>
</details>

这很有趣，因为势头会产生势头。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is interesting in the sense that momentum yields momentum. So,</p>
</details>

嗯，我们谈到了一级方程式，舒马赫说过，你知道，对于完美的机器来说，速度是一种统一的力量，或者类似的话。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we're talking about Formula 1, Schumacher said that, uh, you know, for the perfect machine, uh, speed is a unifying force or something along those lines.</p>
</details>

这其中有些道理，我意识到这实际上让我渴望保持良好的增长速度。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there's something to that and I'm aware that actually puts that I'm I'm eager to have the growth being at a good pace,</p>
</details>

但我当然会担心，如果增长速度过高。所以，你提到的15%可能是我认为我们这样的公司能够长期维持的极限。请记住，我们所有的产品都是自己生产的。所以，我们不能只是从别人那里采购更多东西。这意味着工厂、配送中心，这意味着一个相当庞大的体系，如果增长速度超过这个，我认为……
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course, I'm nervous if that growth gets to the point that gets too high. So, probably the 15 you mentioned should it's probably at the limit that I think a company like ours can sustain for the long term. And and remember we I mean we built all our products ourselves. So so it's not like we can just source something more from somebody. It means factories. It means distribution centers. It means a setup that's that's quite quite big and growing faster than that. I think</p>
</details>

过快增长的风险是什么？风险来自哪里？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the risk what's the risk to growing faster? Where where does the risk come in?</p>
</details>

我认为它来自于复杂性增长过快，或者我们无法提供足够的产能来跟上。因为你需要每年建造相当多的制造厂房面积来维持15%的增长以及随之而来的一切。而且，这很难，也许你可以在一年内做到，但不能年复一年地做到。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it comes from complexity growing too fast or us not being able to deliver the capacity to follow because you you need to build quite some square meters in in manufacturing every year to sustain the 15% and everything that goes with it and and it's it's it's hard maybe you can do it in a single year but not year after year I think.</p>
</details>

扩大文化规模的挑战是什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the challenges to scaling the culture?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为我们正在学习的是，我的意思是，我们现在都坐在比隆的乐高园区里。我们这里有很多员工，其中许多人已经在这里工作了20、30、40年。所以，在这个地区招聘，我们明天就可以招聘一千人，我很有信心他们会很快融入公司文化。现在我们还做了什么呢，我们还在世界各地建立了中心，我们希望在那里发展新的能力。一个例子是哥本哈根。所以我们开始在那里开设了一个办公室，并招募了三到四百名数字专家到这样的办公室。这需要更长的时间，因为你不能把他们和我们现有的文化传承者混在一起。所以这需要更大的努力。同样地，当我们在越南建立一家工厂时，从零开始招聘，我们非常重视如何做到这一点？我们如何引入那些能够传承文化的人，以及我们如何在这方面做到非常精准？但这是一个持续的重点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think what we're learning is that um that uh I mean we sit in billon together here we sit in our liquor on campus. We have a lot of employees here and we have many who have been here for 20, 30, 40 years. So recruiting into this area, we could take a thousand people tomorrow and I would feel pretty certain that very fast they would get into the culture. Now what we've also done is we created hubs in parts of the world where we wanted to put on new capabilities. An example is in Copenhagen. So we started out open an office and got between three and 400 digital experts into an office like that. that takes a little bit longer because you cannot mix them up with with culture carriers that we have. So that takes a much stronger effort to do that. Similarly, when we start a factory in Vietnam, just green field and we start by recruiting that and we have a lot of we actually have a lot of emphasis on how do we do that? How do we bring people in who carries the culture and how can we be very precise on that? But it's an it's an ongoing focus.</p>
</details>

嗯，确保这种情况发生，因为拥有强大的文化只有在整个公司都具备时才真正有价值。如果你只在某些部门拥有它，那么我不确定它是否那么有价值。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh to make sure that that happens because having a strong culture is only really valuable if you have it throughout. If you only have it in pockets then I'm not sure it's so valuable.</p>

你们如何处理失败？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you deal with failure?</p>
</details>

嗯，我的意思是，当我们像现在这样富有创造力时，我们也在创造“失败”。嗯，如果你称之为失败的话，我尽量不称之为失败，因为……
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I mean when you are as creative as we are we are creating failures. Um if you call it failure I try not to call it failure in the sense because there's there's a</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you call it? failure it</p>
</details>

我没有一个好名字，但我们非常努力地不把失败看作一件非常负面的事情。所以，我们称之为**AAR**（After-Action Review: 事后复盘），我们试图从中吸取教训。所以，这是一种你不想重复的失败，至少你想从失败中获得学习。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't have a good name for that but we try very hard to not kind of um make the failure thing a very negative thing so so we uh we call it a AAR so the afteraction review where we try to take the learnings out so uh so it's the kind of a failure you don't want to repeat the failure and at least you want to get out of the failure with a learning.</p>

嗯，我的意思是，我们基本上，围绕一个特定的项目，会有一份你需要参与这次复盘的人员名单，你必须描述发生了什么，并且非常具体地说明我们为什么会陷入这种境地，我们从中吸取了什么教训，以便我们能够将其应用到各个方面。我的意思是，有时从失败中，你实际上可以调整一些东西，或者做一些稍微不同的事情，或者进行调整，然后你可以把它重新带回正轨；或者从中你完全关闭它，然后得出结论，我再也不会那样做了，然后你继续做其他事情。

<p class="english-text">What are some of the things you have learned uh let's say last over the last year?</p>
</details>

哦，那有很多，我的意思是，很多不同的事情。我们有关于产品的。嗯，我们一直在推出新主题，回到增强现实的时代。所以，两三四年前，我们推出了一个名为**Hidden Sight**（Hidden Sight: 乐高积木套装主题）的新系列，它非常奇特。你拿着手机，你可以让这个建筑突然活起来，有幽灵飞来飞去，你可以在周围创造一些东西。它很复杂。我们从未真正成功地使其大获成功。不一定是因为想法不好，而是我们没有成功，我们不得不坐下来讨论，这里有哪些元素是错误的，或者我们没有做对，以及我们是否能从中吸取任何积极的教训。或者如果你谈到可持续发展，我们一直在测试600种材料，以寻找二氧化碳排放更少、化石燃料更少、混合度更高的材料。在某个时候，我们实际上证明了我们的**PET**（Polyethylene terephthalate: 聚对苯二甲酸乙二醇酯，一种常见的塑料材料），也就是来自PET瓶的回收PET，可以用于乐高积木，并且可以部分或完全满足我们非常严格的公差和要求。然而，在实际操作时，我们发现它并没有降低二氧化碳排放。它带来了许多其他问题，而且在积木的质量、声音等方面有太多的妥协。所以我们决定不这样做。嗯，那被认为是，我的意思是，我不得不与许多记者解释为什么这是一个正确的决定，但我认为我们从中变得更强大，今天处于更好的境地，因为我们实际上，是的，我们把它一直推进到终点线，尽管我们最终决定不这样做。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, that's that's there's many um uh I mean many different things. We have those on products. Uh we have been it's typically things that will go on for a while. So we I mean we've been launching new themes back in the days of augmented reality. So uh two or three or four years back we we launched a new set called Hidden Sight and it was it was quite fancy. You had a you had your mobile phone, you could uh you could have this building and suddenly you could bring it alive with ghosts that were flying and you can make things around that. It was complicated. We never really managed to bring that to big success. Not because necessarily the idea was not good but we we were not successful with that and we had to sit down and say what are the elements here that were were wrong or we didn't do right and and is there also any positive learning we can take out of that or if you take sustainability we have been um we were testing 600 materials to find materials that had less uh less CO2 less fertile fuel and were more more more mixed and uh and at one point we actually proved that uh our pet so uh so um recycled PET from PET bottles and so could could be used into Lego bricks and could partly or could fulfill some of the very strong tolerances and the requirements we had. Now getting towards the actually doing it, we figured out it did not lower CO2. It brought a lot of other problems uh with it uh and uh and there were too many compromises on the quality of the brick or the sound of the brick or whatever. So we decided not to do it. Um that was uh that was considered I mean I had to deal with a lot of journalists around explaining why was that the right decision to do but I think we came out of it stronger and in a better situation today because we actually we yeah we do it we d bring it all the way to the finish line although we decided not to do it at the end.</p>

<p class="english-text">Yes. I And for that I actually think we are the we're one of the best uses of plastic. Yeah. You can think of for that reason. You you can have a brick for for 40 years. Uh and and it it keep it keeps getting in in in in play. You give it to your grandchildren or your children and it brings on and one of the requirements on our side is that we ensure this backward compatibility. So you can buy a set tomorrow and you can bring it together with the set your grandparents bought and has probably been in the bathtub or outside in the sun and whatever. And the clutch power you talked about it still works.</p>

### 可持续发展：塑料积木的独特价值

你们如何尝试重新配制塑料，使其更环保？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How are you trying to reformulate the plastic to make it more environmentally friendly?</p>
</details>

是的，我的意思是我们在做两件事。我认为出发点是真正确保人们理解乐高塑料的耐用性。话虽如此，有两个重点。一是我们希望尽可能多地使用可持续和回收材料来制造它。其次，我们希望确保它不会最终成为垃圾。现在它不会，但考虑到我们之前谈到的数十亿块积木。如果有人想把积木还回来，它不应该被浪费或扔进垃圾桶，那么我们就要确保提供一个系统来回收它。我们现在在很多市场都有回收解决方案。但我认为这很重要。这不是什么大问题，因为正如你所说，人们不想这样做。但我不想出现有人想回收而我们却无法做到的情况。现在第三件事是，如果你使用耐用塑料，并且你想提出你刚才在问题中提出的论点，那么就不要使用一次性塑料。所以我们已经进行了一项重大举措，确保作为一家公司，无论对外还是对内，我们都淘汰了一次性塑料。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean we're doing two things. I think the starting point is really making sure people understand the durability of the Lego plastic. That being said, there are two things that's in focus. One is that we would like to make it from more and more sustainable and recycled materials to the extent that is possible. And secondly, we would like to make sure that it doesn't end up in waste. Now it doesn't today, but with the billions we talked about before of bricks out there. If there are people that wants to give the brick bags, the bricks back, it should not go to waste or in the garbage bin, then we would want to make sure we provide a system to bring that back. And we are having takeback solutions in in quite a few markets today. But I think that's important. It's not a big deal because as you said, people don't want to do that. But but I don't want a situation where somebody wants to and we cannot uh we cannot do it. Now the third thing is really that if you are into durable plastic and you want to run the argument that you just put forward uh in in your question then don't have single-use plastic around. So we have had a big undertaking to make sure that as a company externally and internally we got rid of single-use plastic.</p>
</details>

因为否则，耐用塑料的故事就不那么有说服力了。

你们是首批将奖金与排放挂钩的公司之一。这是如何运作的？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you were one of the first companies to tie bonuses to emissions. How does this work?</p>
</details>

嗯，我的意思是，正如你所知，奖金就像你希望激励一个组织去做好的事情，但你也希望它尽可能可控。我的意思是，你我都不喜欢我们无法影响的奖金。所以，我认为这才是更大的问题。所以我们主要关注**范围一和范围二排放**（Scope one and two emissions: 范围一指企业直接排放，范围二指企业购买电力、热力等产生的间接排放）。所以，这些是公司自身控制范围内的事务，我们还检查了那些对员工观点也很重要的事务。你是否选择电动汽车作为公司用车？我们在内部也做出了哪些选择？所以目前大部分奖金都与这些事情有关。现在我们有一个雄心，很快就会转向更广泛的范围。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it's uh, as you know with bonuses, it's like you would like to incentivize an organization on what's good, what we want to, but you also would like to keep it as controllable as possible. It's not I mean you and I don't like a bonus that we cannot influence obviously. So I think that's been the bigger the bigger uh the bigger problem here. So we focused in on mainly scope one and two. So uh things that are in the company's own control and and we we checked on things that also had or measure on things that also matters from employees point of view. Are are you choosing your company car to be an electric vehicle or not? What choices are we also making internally? So most of the bonus at this point in time are on those kind of things. Now we have an ambition to very soon move to a broader.</p>

<p class="english-text">Now let's um travel from Bon to uh to Asia. Um how important is China for LEGO's future?</p>
</details>

嗯，我的意思是，如果你有一个让产品触达世界上每个孩子或尽可能多孩子的基本使命，那么中国和印度都是非常重要的市场。所以，它很重要，如果从纯商业角度看，它可能在使命和目标方面比今天更重要。嗯，这部分与我们之前提到的一些内容有关，即我们正在建立品牌，我们正在创造分销和零售覆盖范围，同时我们也开始进行制造。所以，为了实现这一点，我们在中国进行了大量投资，所以它很重要，我们现在在中国相当成功，而且在过去15年里，我想说，我们取得了显著的增长。但如果你的问题是印度有多重要，那么我会说，我们在印度的旅程可能落后了10年，我们必须开始做所有这些事情。我们正在一个不习惯玩乐高积木的国家建立品牌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's uh I mean if you have a basic mission of getting to every child in the world or getting to as many children in the world as possible then China and India for that sake are very important markets. So so it's important it's probably more important purpose and missionwise than it is in pure commercials if you look at it today. Uh and that's part to some of what we touched on before that we are building a brand we are creating uh distribution and retail uh reach uh while uh while we also starting manufacturing uh so so there's a lot of investments in into China to make that happen so it it is important and we are quite successful uh in China right now and we've been added for the last 15 years I would say uh significantly but if your question went on to say how important is India then I would say then we're probably 10 years back on that journey and we have to start to do all these things. We're building a brand in a country that was not used to playing with Lego bricks.</p>

<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

嗯，我们，我们开始时可能和许多公司没什么不同，但我们确实专注于大都市区。所以，像北京、上海，也许还有一些中国更大的城市。同时，我们开始进行更传统的品牌宣传活动。然后我们开设了零售店。所以我们实际上在中国有很多零售店，这些店里只有乐高品牌，因为这个机会……
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we uh we started out probably not unlike many companies, but we did focus on the bigger metropolitan areas. So, it's like Beijing, it's Shanghai, maybe Hao, some of the bigger places in China. and really uh at the same time started in more traditional brand campaign type thing. Uh a and then we opened retail stores. So we actually have quite a few retail stores in China that only only has the Lego brand in them because this opportunity.</p>
</details>

嗯，能够进入商店，进入乐高世界，并亲身体验，这是一种非常重要的方式，它比单纯的品牌宣传活动效果更好。所以，我认为你必须同时在多个维度进行投资。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh to get into a store and get into the Lego universe and see that has been a very important way and it does better than a than a branding campaign for that sake. So you have to I think invest along several dimensions at the same time.</p>
</details>

这也许是作为家族企业的好处，因为，我的意思是，如果你能今天投资品牌建设，明天投资零售店，后天投资产品组合，那会更好，但你必须同时做所有这些才能让它们融合并真正奏效。所以，这就是我们在中国所做的，然后我们已经把这个模式从大城市复制到二线、三线、四线城市。
<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's maybe an area where it's good to be familyowned because that uh I mean it would be nicer if you could invest in brand building today and retail stores tomorrow and then product portfolio the day after but you kind of do have to do it all for that to gel and actually work out. So um so that's what we've done in China and and then we have kind of taken it from the bigger cities now to tier two to tier three to tier four cities and that model have we've replicated throughout.</p>

### 领导力哲学与职业发展建议

嗯，关于数字化转型，人工智能对你们有什么好处？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What uh on the digital transformation just uh AI, how do you benefit from that?</p>
</details>

是的，我想我只会诚实地说，人工智能是我们谈论很多的话题。真正从中获益还处于早期阶段。我们实际上从两个不同的方面思考人工智能，一方面是我们可以如何实现某种变革性的东西，如果你看看我们的业务，变革性的东西就是，我的意思是，我们能否用它来促进创造力，或者至少帮助我们的设计师将更多时间花在创造力上。我认为这是一种，你能想象一个应用程序能立即为你建造一个乐高城堡，并为你提供建造方案和建造说明之类的东西吗？现在这可能有点遥远，但我们能否有办法利用我们的技术，让设计师更有效率。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I guess I'll just be honest to say AI is something we talk a lot about. It's still early days in really reaping benefits. We we actually think about AI in in two different ways where on the one side it's kind of where can we make something more transformational and if you look at our business transformational is around I mean can we use it to foster creativity or to at least help our designers to spend even more of their time on creativity. I think that's something I can you imagine an app that immediately uh build me a Lego castle and it will give you a proposal for how to do that and the building instruction or whatever. Now that's probably a little bit out but could could we have ways of using our technology to make designers more effective.</p>
</details>

我们可以像其他人一样编写代码。所以我们拥有的许多软件工程师可以更快地编写代码。这些都是你可以说能带来真正巨大提升的事情。另一个是所有人的日常生产力。而且，我认为我们可能和许多其他公司一样，我相信随着时间的推移，我们需要看到从中产生的生产力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can code like everybody else. So the the many software engineers we have they can code faster. Those are things where you can say here you get a real a real big increase. The other one is really day-to-day productivity for all of us. And uh and I think we are we're probably like many other companies in that that I believe over time we need to see productivity coming from that.</p>
</details>

我们正在努力弄清楚如何通过投资其中一些方面，在更广泛的范围内实现这一点。我们一直非常注重保护我们的数据和信息，确保我们没有在乐高模型或乐高特定数据上训练的模型。所以从这个意义上说，我们一直在努力确保我们对围绕此的安全、IP和商标事宜有很好的控制，然后我们才开始涉足我谈到的那些事情。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're trying to figure out how do we do that in the in the broader scale by investing behind behind some of this. We've been we've been we've been quite focused on protecting our our data and our information that that we don't have models out there trained on legal on on legal models or legal specific data. So in that sense we've been uh we've been trying to make sure we were well in control of the kind of security and the IP and trademark things around that before we are now venturing into the things I talked about.</p>

</details>

我想我处于某种中间地带，也许这是一种很好的结合，我处于两个方面之间。我受过工程师培训。所以，我的意思是，我过去常常发明技术性质的东西。所以我有一种创造性的一面，而且，我对此非常兴奋，但我也有一种观念，除非它真正以某种方式实现并得到执行，并且有流程支持，否则它毫无价值。所以我有点像两面派。我喜欢让人们有空间去创造，也让他们自己做决定。所以，作为一名领导者，我努力在护栏或我们试图实现的总方向上保持相当清晰。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess I'm somewhere and maybe that's like that's a good mix of I'm I'm somewhere on two sides. I'm an engineer by training. So I uh I mean I used to in invent stuff of technical nature. So I I I have kind of the creative side to me and and the and the uh I can get really excited about that, but I also have this kind of that it is not worth anything unless it really gets to fruition in a way and gets executed and and there's processes behind and that. So I'm a little bit of uh of both sides. I I I like to I like to allow people the space to both be creative but also to make their own make their own decisions. So, so as a leader I try to I try to be quite clear on the on the guard rails or the overall direction of what is we are trying to achieve.</p>
</details>

嗯，总的来说，这样就能有一定程度的，我的意思是，如果总体方向非常明确，那么组织内会有更多的人或领导者会感到自在地做出自己的决定，因为他们知道我们正在努力实现什么，我相信这种决策权力，如果它存在的话，而且我认为只有当框架清晰时它才真正存在。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh in total so that there is a certain I mean if there's good clarity on the overall direction then more people or more leaders within the organization would feel comfortable making their own decision because they know what we're trying to achieve and I believe in that decision power if it's there uh and and I think it's only really there if the frames are clear I.</p>

嗯，但是，我的意思是，如果我只是放开手，说“好吧，我授权每个人做他们想做的事情”，那么我可以向你保证，像我们这样的组织会朝着一百万个不同的方向发展，因为我们有这么多有创造力的人。所以，这有点像你如何引导创造力？你如何引导许多人的决策朝着你试图实现的方向发展，通过在你的立场上保持非常一致的路线？所以，我认为组织会认为我在战略清晰度方面非常投入，以及我们在做什么方面非常投入，确保在那些我们不能朝着许多不同方向发展的领域，运营模式非常非常清晰，并且我们确实按照它来执行。而在这里，在创造性方面，我的意思是，他们每个星期五都可以做他们想做的事情，或者，我的意思是，有不同的事情，不同的方式来做，平衡这些。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and uh but uh but of course if you just and that's my point if you just open up and say okay I I empower everybody to do whatever they they want to then I can guarantee you an organization like this can run in a million different directions because we have so many creative people. So it's kind of this how do you steer creativity? How do you steer also decision making from many in the direction that you're trying to achieve by having a very similar um line on where you are? So I think I think the or will see me as very involved in strategic clarity and uh and what we do very involved in making sure that the operating model in the areas where we cannot go in many different directions is super super clear and that we actually execute along it. while over here on the creative side I mean every Friday they can do whatever they want or I mean there's just different things different ways of doing that and balancing that.</p>

是的，我们最初是三年，如果你做三年，感觉你一直身处其中。如果你做五年，感觉第五年太遥远了，你不知道会发生什么。所以，我不知道四年是否好得多。但事实证明四年对我们来说效果很好。它也像，你知道，我们的产品开发周期。我的意思是，几个月后，我们将批准2027年的产品组合。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we started out with three and if you do it three, it feels like you're in it all the time. If you do five, it feels like the fifth year is so far out, you don't know what happens. So, I don't know that four is much better. But it turned out that four works pretty well for us. It also is like, you know, our product development cycle. I mean, in a couple of months, we will approve the 2027 product portfolio.</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个两年的周期，四年让我们可以在一个时期内有两次机会。嗯，所以四年对我们来说效果很好，但我认为它必须足够长，以便你可以启动一些倡议并开始看到一些结果。它需要足够短，而不是一个长期的愿景。我们的长期愿景延伸到2032年，甚至2039年，届时我们最活跃的所有者将年满60岁。所以我们思考品牌，品牌在2039年应该是什么样子？我们如何确保它像今天一样强大？这就是为什么我们需要在数字领域变得更强大等等。所以，我们有不同的时间范围，但四年时间范围是一个经过深思熟虑且非常可操作的时间范围，这可能就是为什么它不应该太长。
<details>

<p class="english-text">So, it's a 2-year horizon and four years is allows us two roles if you want uh within within a a period. Um, so 4 years works well for us, but I think it has to be long enough that you can start initiatives and start to see some of the results. It needs to be short enough that it's not just a long-term vision. Our long-term vision goes to 2032 or even 2039 where our most active owner turns 60 years old. So we think about the brand, how should the brand look in 2039? How do we make sure it is as strong as today? That's why we need to get in digital stronger and stuff. So, so we have different horizons, but the four-year horizon is a pretty is a pretty well thought through, very u also operationalized horizon, and that's probably why it shouldn't be too long.</p>

你如何选择它们？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you choose them?</p>
</details>

嗯，是的，我想我选择它们是基于创造我们刚才谈到的这种环境所需的一切，无论是战略是否清晰，或者，我的意思是，如果某个领域没有进展，或者你知道，有时在一个组织中可能会出现摩擦，也许有些部门对需要发生的事情没有完全相同的意见，有时它可能会陷入循环，这时就需要把它提出来。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Um yeah, I I I guess I choose them from from everything it takes to create this surrounding we just talked about whether the strategy is clear or or I um I I mean if there's an area that doesn't move or you know sometimes in an organization there can be churn that maybe there are departments that are not exactly the the same opinion of needs to happen and it can just cycle in circles sometimes that needs to be brought up.</p>

速度有多重要？

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is speed?</p>
</details>

它很重要。嗯，我认为它相当重要，但它有点像，有时我们说，慢下来才能快起来是有道理的。所以速度不应该被误解为你不应该正确规划，或者你不能在背后建立一些结构。嗯，但有时你就是必须快速行动，但有时为了我们四年后能走得更远，也许我们应该非常非常清楚我们需要做什么。我从一些事情中得到的教训和经验是，如果你只是跳进去，然后只是跑，如果六个月后你发现你所做的事情并没有真正进展，那么你就没有取得什么成就。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is important. Uh it's um I think it's quite important, but it's kind of um sometimes we say it makes sense to go slow to go fast. So speed should not be misunderstood in the way that you shouldn't plan right or you you cannot build some structure behind it. Uh but sometimes you just have to move fast but sometimes in order for us to be far four years from now maybe we should be very very clear on what we what we need to do. One of my learnings and experiences over something if you just jump into it and you just run if 6 months later you sit with something that doesn't really move then you haven't accomplished.</p>
</details>

很多。所以，它不是单一的追求速度，但当然速度很重要。世界变化真的很快。

执行力的关键是什么？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the key to execution power?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为很大一部分是清晰度，然后，我认为，嗯，你能说坚定不移吗？即使作为CEO，当事情不那么有趣时，你也要不断追问，并确保我们坚持下去。嗯，你可能会惊讶，像我们这样一家非常有创造力的公司，我们非常专注于每年提高生产力。我们称之为“生产力伙伴计划”，这是一个全球性的项目，我们每年都会大幅提高生产力并节省丹麦克朗。而且，我认为现在每个人都知道，生产力是为我们能够做的所有那些超级令人兴奋的事情买单的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I I think it's a lot of it is clarity and then and then uh I think just uh can you say steadfast the way you even as a CEO when it's not interesting you keep asking to it and you keep making sure that we're staying at it. Um and uh you probably be surprised that uh that a company like us that are very creative we are quite we quite focused on getting productivity out every year. We call it partner for productivity. is a global program and we crunch out significant significant productivity and Danish croner every year and uh and uh I think everybody by now knows that productivity is what's paying for all the super exciting things we can do over and above.</p>
</details>

没有这个，就没有那个，那很难，那是一些，我的意思是，我认为你非常清楚并且坚持不懈，我认为这对于执行部分很重要。另一个当然是清晰度。我的意思是，我们在工厂有一个运营模式，你今天有机会看到了。我可以告诉你，我们现在在全球有六家工厂。它们看起来完全一样。它们的运作方式完全一样。所以你可以把这里的一个操作员带到捷克共和国或越南，他们明天就可以在那里工作。我认为这种刚性也赋予了你执行力，因为对于要做什么几乎没有疑问，或者几乎没有改变那个过程的自由。

<p class="english-text">And without this not that and that is uh that's difficult and that's something that uh I mean I think that that that you're very clear and you stay on I think that's important for the um uh for the um execution part. The other one is of course the clarity. I mean we have an operating model in the factory that you've had an opportunity to see to see today. I can tell you we have we have six factories right now around the globe. They look exactly the same. They operate exactly the same. So you can take an operator from here and bring the person to Czech Republic or Vietnam and they can work there tomorrow. And that kind of rigidity in I think that gives you executional power as well that there is very little doubt about what to do or there's very little freedom to change that process.</p>

这是一个，这是一个小插曲，从我刚开始的时候，你知道，我的意思是，我来到乐高公司这个品牌时也超级谦逊，你如何，你如何做到这一点？我来了，我想在来这里之前，这已经是将近8年前的事了，在来这里之前，我以为我对它会是什么样子，以及应该改变什么有想法。但来到这里一个月后，我站在市政厅里，我真的谈到了我们会议太多，会议里的人太多，嗯，在做出决定之前会议太多，我的意思是，你可能会说，啊，这难道是一个新CEO能给公司带来的最重要的事情吗？但我认为这对我们来说超级超级重要，我现在正在推动这一点，我的意思是，通常一个领导团队会坐在一起，他们会有很多事情要处理，他们会每月举行例会等等，我们已经改变了这一点，我们已经创建了甚至是我们领导团队的子小组，我们进行授权，我们现在有所谓的商业三角，它是首席商务官、首席运营官和首席营销官，他们在一起，我们授权他们做出所有决策，让日常工作顺利进行，只有当他们完全意见不合或不知道该怎么做时，他们才能上报，这在所有层面都适用。这实际上意味着我们作为一个领导团队，每月只开一个小时或一个半小时的会，然后每年四次，每次三天，仅此而已。其余的工作都在小团队中完成，并且已经达到了下一个层次，他们也进行了授权。现在当然，这意味着你需要相互告知。这也意味着他们必须非常清楚总体上我们正在努力实现什么？但如果你能简化这一点，让更少的人参与所有事情，并且有更清晰的认识，那么你就能获得速度。

<p class="english-text">It's a it's it's a little have an anecdote from when I started you know when um I mean I was also super humble coming into the Lego company this brand and how can you how can you do that and I came in and I I I think before arriving here this is now almost 8 years ago and uh before arriving here I thought I had ideas to what would it be and what should change and a month into being here I stood in the town hall and I literally talked about us having too many meetings too many people in the meetings too uh too many meetings before there was a decision I mean things that you would say ah is that now the most important thing a new CEO can bring to a company but I think it was just super super important for us and I I'm I'm pushing this now that we um I mean normally a leadership team would be sitting and they would have a lot of things on their agenda they would meet every month in dayong meetings and stuff like that and we've changed that we've kind of created subgroups of even I leadership team that we delegate we have now what we call commercial triangle it's the it's the chief commercial officer the chief operating officer and the chief marketing officer there together they are we've delegated to them to make all the decisions to make the the wheel go every day on that and only if they totally disagree or they don't know what to do they can escalate that goes down on all levels it actually means that we as a leadership team we meet one hour or one and a half hour every month and then four times a year for 3 days that's it. The rest is being done in smaller teams and that has gone to the next level and they have they have also delegated in that sense. Now of course it means that you need to keep each other informed. It also means that they have to be pretty clear on overall what are we trying to move up against? But if you can simplify that and have many or have fewer people involved in everything and more clarity around it, then you you just gain speed.</p>

嗯，如果我们需要改变或做一些事情来保持相关性，那么我们就会去做。然后我们会继续确保，仅仅因为我们成功并赚了很多钱，这实际上是一个很大的危险，因为你很容易变得自满，或者在所有流程中变得过于高效，让太多人参与到所有事情中。这是我们需要积极对抗的事情，因为我们秉持着关怀和协作的价值观，我的意思是，我为什么不邀请另外10个人参加会议呢？这样他们也知道这件事，而且，他们会对此感觉良好。这不是我们想要的，而且，我认为作为一个领导团队，我们需要不断努力，因为存在一种惯性，想要让这种情况发生，我们需要摆脱这种惯性。

So, so I so I think for that sense it's around following following the interest or passions and and uh and and trying to trying to look for the next exciting opportunity or challenge within that and trying it out and and learning from that. Uh you know I think we are I think we're better versions of of ourselves if we work with something that we are fundamentally interested in.</p>

嗯，这样做你往往会表现得更好。你可能会得到下一个挑战，你可以继续下去。我认为，我认为这就是前进的方向，而且，如果我们将职业生涯的视角也考虑进去，你该怎么做呢？那么我会说，确保你尝试不同的事情，这并不是一场竞赛。我认为很少有人最终成为CEO是走了一条直线。我的意思是，路上会有一些机会，如果你抓住它们，它们会很有趣，而且从这个意义上说，它从来都不是一条直线。对我来说也不是。我没有计划它。但是，我，我抓住了一些我认为非常有趣，并且符合我需要做的事情。我认为，所以这就是我会做的。在职业规划上放松一点，但更专注于什么令人兴奋，然后我认为它就会到来。

It wasn't for me. I didn't plan it. Uh but I uh I I jumped on some things that I thought was super interesting that fitted what I needed to do.
