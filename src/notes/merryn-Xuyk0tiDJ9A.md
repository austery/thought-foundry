### 介绍：激进投资的复苏

Welcome to Merryn Talks Money, the podcast in which people who know the markets explain the markets. I'm Merryn Somerset Webb.
欢迎收听《Merryn谈钱》，这个播客里懂市场的人会为你解读市场。我是Merryn Somerset Webb。

This week, we are talking about activist investing, why it's seeing a resurgence, and what that means for the investment landscape and possibly for your portfolio.
本周，我们将讨论**激进投资** (Activist Investing: 寻求在公司中获得足够影响力以推动变革，从而提高公司价值的投资策略)，它为何会卷土重来，以及这对投资格局和你的投资组合可能意味着什么。

I'm speaking with Joe Bowen, CEO and CIO at Asset Value Investors and the manager of AVI Global Trust as well as AVI Japan Opportunity Trust.
我正在与**Asset Value Investors (AVI)** (资产价值投资者：一家专注于发现被低估资产并积极参与公司治理以释放价值的投资公司)的首席执行官兼**CIO** (Chief Investment Officer: 首席投资官) Joe Bowen 对话，他同时管理着**AVI Global Trust** (AVI全球信托)和**AVI Japan Opportunity Trust** (AVI日本机会信托)。

AVI Asset Value Investors is a UK-based active investor open to private investors. That means the group targets quality companies trading at discounts, often family-controlled **holding companies** (控股公司: 通过持有其他公司的股权来控制这些公司的公司), and tries to unlock their value through active engagement.
AVI资产价值投资者是一家总部位于英国的活跃投资者，对个人投资者开放。这意味着该集团的目标是那些以折价交易的优质公司，通常是家族控制的控股公司，并通过积极参与来释放其价值。

So we talked to Joe about the strategy behind AVI Global Trust, how his strategy works, and what mistakes he's made along the way, as well as the opportunities he now sees abroad in both Japan and in Korea. Joe, welcome to Merryn Talks Money.
因此，我们与乔讨论了AVI全球信托背后的策略、他的策略如何运作、他一路走来犯了哪些错误，以及他现在在日本和韩国看到的海外机会。乔，欢迎来到《Merryn谈钱》。

Joe: Thanks for having me. It's good to be here. All right. I know you've got quite a lot of fans among our audience, but you may also have some listeners with us today who don't know much about you and what you do. So, I wonder if you could just set us up by telling us about how you invest and why.
Joe: 谢谢邀请。很高兴来到这里。好的。我知道你在我们的听众中有很多粉丝，但今天也可能有一些听众对你和你的工作不太了解。所以，我想请你先介绍一下你是如何投资的，以及原因。

### AVI的投资理念：市场低效与价值释放

Joe: The starting point for everything we do at AVI is the idea that **stock markets aren't always efficient** (股票市场并非总是有效的: 指市场价格不能总是完全反映所有可用信息，从而存在被低估或高估的资产). We're all told that stock markets are efficient, and I think that's only really true about certain parts of it, typically the largest, liquid, most well-researched and covered names.
Joe: 我们AVI所有工作的出发点都是“股票市场并非总是有效的”这一理念。我们都被告知股票市场是有效的，但我认为这只在某些部分是真实的，通常是那些最大、流动性最好、研究最充分、覆盖面最广的股票。

Yeah, they're quite efficient, but they're always parts of the stock market that are neglected, overlooked, under-researched, and that gives rise to inefficiencies. And that's generally the parts of the stock market that we are interested.
是的，它们确实很有效率，但总有一些股票市场的部分被忽视、遗漏、研究不足，这就会导致**低效** (Inefficiencies: 指市场价格未能准确反映资产真实价值的情况)。而这正是我们通常感兴趣的股票市场部分。

And on top of that, we particularly like the idea about being able to buy into good quality businesses that are trading below the value of their assets or their businesses. The two are actually linked. The discount arises simply because the fact that price discovery isn't working.
此外，我们特别喜欢能够买入那些交易价格低于其资产或业务价值的优质企业。这两者实际上是相互关联的。折价的出现仅仅是因为价格发现机制没有发挥作用。

That philosophy or process permeates everything we do. And then I think the third angle of our approach is it's great to buy something that when it's cheap. It's great to buy good business that you think is going to go up in value, but hope is not a strategy.
这种理念或流程渗透到我们所做的每一件事中。然后我认为我们方法的第三个角度是，在价格便宜时买入东西很棒。买入你认为会升值的优质企业很棒，但“希望”不是一种策略。

And the third element of our approach really is working as an engaged shareholder to try and address and remedy that mispricing, that **undervaluation** (估值过低: 指资产的市场价格低于其内在价值). So in some cases it could be **shareholder activism** (股东积极主义: 股东通过直接或间接行动影响公司管理层决策，以提升公司价值的行为). In some cases it's a softer **shareholder engagement** (股东参与: 股东与公司管理层进行沟通和对话，以影响公司决策和策略的过程) process. But it's always about trying to do something to unlock value.
我们方法的第三个要素是，作为一个积极参与的股东，努力解决和纠正这种错误定价、这种估值过低的情况。因此，在某些情况下，它可能是股东积极主义。在某些情况下，它是一个更温和的股东参与过程。但其核心始终是尝试做一些事情来释放价值。

Merryn: Okay, so here's the difference. If I talk to any fund manager I talk to is going to say roughly what you have said to me, it may be in a slightly different way. They're all going to say that they are finding value where other people are not. That anything they buy is going to be mispriced by the rest of the market.
Merryn: 好的，所以区别在这里。如果我与任何基金经理交谈，他们都会大致说你告诉我的这些话，可能方式略有不同。他们都会说他们在别人看不到的地方发现了价值。他们买入的任何东西都会被市场其他部分错误定价。

That's if you call yourself growth, you call yourself value, whatever you call yourself. When you are an active investor and you buy a share, you believe you have seen something that the rest of the market has not seen. But the difference here between what you are saying and other people say is that you are attempting yourself to create the catalyst to bring out the value.
无论是自称成长型投资者、价值型投资者，还是其他任何称谓。当你是一个积极投资者并购买股票时，你相信你看到了市场其他部分没有看到的东西。但你所说的与其他人所说的区别在于，你正在尝试自己创造催化剂来释放价值。

Joe: There's another angle as well and that is that yeah of course every analyst, every fund manager has got a model and they're going to have a target price or target valuation. What's interesting about many of the companies that we invest in is that they own assets and businesses that could be liquidated today for a pound and they're trading at 60, 70.
Joe: 还有另一个角度，那就是，当然，每个分析师、每个基金经理都有一个模型，他们会有一个目标价格或目标估值。我们投资的许多公司有趣之处在于，它们拥有的资产和业务今天就可以按一英镑的价格清算，而它们却以60、70便士的价格交易。

These aren't **blue sky valuations** (蓝天估值: 基于未来高度乐观预期而非当前实际资产的估值). These are actual **liquidation values** (清算价值: 公司资产在被出售以偿还债务时的估计价值). And I guess the most extreme example of that is what we see in Japan and have seen in Japan for many years. And that is many companies in Japan holding huge amounts of surplus net cash on their balance sheets. And in the most extreme cases, the value of that cash and sometimes other listed securities is well above the market cap of the company.
这些不是**蓝天估值** (Blue Sky Valuations: 基于未来高度乐观预期而非当前实际资产的估值)，而是实际的**清算价值** (Liquidation Values: 公司资产在被出售以偿还债务时的估计价值)。我想最极端的例子就是我们在日本看到的，并且多年来一直在日本看到的情况。那就是日本许多公司在资产负债表上持有大量盈余净现金。在最极端的情况下，这些现金以及有时其他上市证券的价值远高于公司的市值。

### 日本市场的变革：从现金囤积到股东利益

Merryn: And that was an extraordinary thing. I mean, you'd started your Japan-only strategy. There are two trusts here just for those who don't know the AVI global and then another AVI trust that specializes in Japan. You started that about seven years ago. And even before you had started that, I had been writing for years about exactly that kind of value.
Merryn: 那真是件非凡的事情。我是说，你启动了你的日本专属策略。这里有两个信托，对于那些不了解的人来说，一个是AVI全球信托，另一个是专门投资日本的AVI信托。你大约在七年前启动了后者。甚至在你启动之前，我就已经写了好几年关于那种价值的文章了。

And there it was. There's cash. It's just sitting there. These companies, some of them with more cash on the balance sheet than their market capitalization. But nonetheless, year after year, the market simply ignored that. And then something changed.
它就在那里。有现金。它就摆在那里。这些公司，其中一些资产负债表上的现金甚至超过了它们的市值。但尽管如此，年复一年，市场却对此视而不见。然后，情况发生了变化。

Joe: That's right. For many years, the mantra in Japan was we need to have cash for a rainy day. And uh in fact, when you spoke to companies in Japan, it became clear that that they were told employees were told that if a shareholder asks for the money back, you tell them it doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the company. You know, a very subtle but important difference.
Joe: 没错。多年来，日本的口头禅是“我们需要为不时之需储备现金”。事实上，当你与日本公司交流时，你会发现员工被告知，如果股东要求返还资金，你告诉他们这不属于他们，而是属于公司。你知道，这是一个非常微妙但重要的区别。

But all of it changed around 10 years ago with the introduction under the late prime minister Abe of the **corporate governance code** (公司治理准则: 旨在规范公司董事会、管理层与股东之间关系，确保公司透明、负责运营的指导原则) and the **stewardship code** (尽责管理准则: 鼓励机构投资者积极履行其作为股东的职责，与被投资公司进行有效沟通的准则) which really attempted to change the psychology of businesses of companies in Japan and promote the interests of shareholders which for so long had been really knocked back and companies had been run primarily for employees, society, pensioners but not for shareholders and that really has changed in the last decade.
但这一切在大约十年前发生了变化，随着已故首相安倍晋三引入了**公司治理准则** (Corporate Governance Code: 旨在规范公司董事会、管理层与股东之间关系，确保公司透明、负责运营的指导原则)和**尽责管理准则** (Stewardship Code: 鼓励机构投资者积极履行其作为股东的职责，与被投资公司进行有效沟通的准则)。这些准则真正试图改变日本企业的心理，并促进股东的利益。长期以来，股东利益一直被压制，公司主要为员工、社会和养老金领取者运营，而不是为股东。这种情况在过去十年中确实发生了改变。

It's taken a long time, but we're seeing companies focused a lot more on their share price. They are more conscious of **capital efficiency** (资本效率: 公司利用其资本产生收入和利润的效率), not blindly accumulating cash and doing nothing with it, but buying back shares, investing in their business, returning it in other ways to shareholders.
这花了很多时间，但我们看到公司更加关注股价。他们更注重**资本效率** (Capital Efficiency: 公司利用其资本产生收入和利润的效率)，不再盲目囤积现金无所作为，而是回购股票、投资业务，以及通过其他方式向股东返还资金。

We see many companies in Japan, they're bothered today about their share price. They want to know what they can do to achieve a higher share price. And if a shareholder comes and and has a constructive answer to that dilemma, then unlike many years ago, they want to hear. You know, in the past, they didn't want to speak to us, now they do.
我们看到日本的许多公司，现在都关心自己的股价。他们想知道能做些什么来提高股价。如果股东带着建设性的解决方案来应对这个困境，那么与多年前不同，他们现在愿意倾听。你知道，过去他们不想和我们说话，现在他们愿意了。

### 日本市场的持续机会与私募股权的影响

Merryn: And are you still finding lots of opportunities in Japan? I mean, it's been a good run, right? And your performance has been extremely good in Japan. So, are you looking around now and going there, well, you know, that was great, but maybe it's time to move on.
Merryn: 你在日本还发现很多机会吗？我是说，那段时期表现很好，对吧？你们在日本的业绩非常出色。所以，你现在是不是在环顾四周，然后觉得，嗯，那很棒，但也许是时候继续前进了？

Joe: Yeah, we are seeing many, many opportunities today. The opportunity set has evolved. Clearly the extreme valuations we identified seven, eight years ago have moderated to an extent, but what has changed is is the catalyst.
Joe: 是的，我们今天看到了很多很多机会。机会集合已经演变。显然，我们七八年前发现的极端估值已经有所缓和，但改变的是催化剂。

So seven or eight years ago, you had to work really hard to get companies to talk to you, to listen to you, to try and do some of the things that we were suggesting. Today they are much more willing and the door is much more open than it was seven or eight years ago.
所以七八年前，你必须非常努力才能让公司和你交谈，听取你的意见，并尝试做我们建议的一些事情。今天他们更愿意了，门也比七八年前敞开得多。

So in that in that sense, there's still discounted valuations and the catalyst is is much more likely to arrive. And the other change that's happened over the last seven or eight years is the presence of **private equity** (私募股权: 投资于非上市公司股权或对上市公司进行私有化投资的资金) in Japan.
所以从这个意义上说，仍然存在折价估值，而且催化剂更有可能出现。过去七八年发生的另一个变化是**私募股权** (Private Equity: 投资于非上市公司股权或对上市公司进行私有化投资的资金)在日本的存在。

So Japan has notoriously been a market in which **hostile takeover** (恶意收购: 未经目标公司董事会同意，通过直接向股东购买股票等方式强行收购公司控制权的行为) activity hasn't worked where companies are desperate to stay listed to not be taken over by vultures, particularly foreign vulture private equity funds.
所以日本市场一直以来都以恶意收购活动难以成功而闻名，公司不惜一切代价保持上市，以避免被秃鹫，尤其是外国秃鹫私募股权基金收购。

But the presence of of private equity has been growing over the last seven years, both the domestic sector and also the global sector. And whilst we've been making the lives of the listed companies a little bit more challenging by being an activist shareholder, on the other side of the table, private equity has been the nice guy.
但在过去七年里，私募股权的存在一直在增长，无论是国内还是全球领域。虽然我们作为激进股东，让上市公司过得稍微有些挑战，但在谈判桌的另一边，私募股权一直扮演着“好人”的角色。

It's been playing golf, taking them to restaurants and trying to tell them that life as a private company could be good for them, could be good for our employees, could be good for society. And so we're seeing a big pickup and the double effect I suppose of more activist shareholders, more willing management teams and the threat of um change of **corporate control** (公司控制权: 拥有对公司运营和战略决策施加影响或控制的能力) is really driving leading to a a big increase in change of corporate control uh market and that's really helping compress the discounts.
他们打高尔夫、请吃饭，试图告诉这些公司，作为一家私营企业可能对他们有好处，对他们的员工有好处，对社会也有好处。所以我们看到了一个巨大的增长，我认为是更多的激进股东、更愿意合作的管理团队以及公司控制权变更的威胁，这三者的双重效应正在真正推动公司控制权市场的大幅增长，这确实有助于压缩折价。

Merryn: I'd say when I was last in Japan about a year ago and I was talking to a lot of people about private equity and quite a lot of the private equity players were finding it to be a very different market to the one they were used to and much more difficult to operate in.
Merryn: 我想说，大约一年前我上次去日本时，我与很多人谈论私募股权，很多私募股权参与者发现这是一个与他们习惯的市场截然不同的市场，操作起来要困难得多。

Joe: Much more difficult to operate in. Anecdotally, what I've seen is there's still a resistance to hostile takeover activity. But what's helped has been in a sense the evolution of activist shareholders on registers.
Joe: 操作起来困难得多。根据我的经验，我看到的是对**恶意收购** (Hostile Takeover: 未经目标公司董事会同意，通过直接向股东购买股票等方式强行收购公司控制权的行为)活动仍然存在抵制。但有所帮助的是，从某种意义上说，登记在册的激进股东的演变。

So you now found when you look at our portfolio for example, there's a handful of situations where 30 to 40% of the shares are held by two or three different activist shareholders and that's quite an interesting development from private equity perspective it means that rather than approach a company not having any shares not having any support on the register, you could now approach a company with 30 to 40% support and you could say this is what we want to do and then it almost becomes a **fetto complete** (既成事实: 一个法语短语，指已经发生且无法改变的事情) not always but it makes life very difficult for management if such a large proportion of their register want to see some kind of change of corporate control.
所以你现在会发现，例如，当我们查看我们的投资组合时，有少数情况下，30%到40%的股份由两三个不同的激进股东持有，这从私募股权的角度来看是一个非常有趣的发展。这意味着，私募股权不再是接近一家没有股份、没有注册支持的公司，而是可以带着30%到40%的支持去接近一家公司，并说出我们想做的事情，这样一来，这几乎就成为了一个**既成事实** (Fetto Complete: 一个法语短语，指已经发生且无法改变的事情)。虽然并非总是如此，但如果如此大比例的股东希望看到某种公司控制权的改变，那么管理层的工作就会变得非常困难。

### 日本的具体投资案例：三菱物流

Merryn: Okay. Interesting. And what have you most recently bought in Japan?
Merryn: 好的，有意思。你最近在日本买了什么？

Joe: We've been buying **Mitsubishi Logistics** (三菱物流: 日本一家大型物流公司), which is a a a very large logistics company. Very very interesting valuation in in the sense that not only is a very profitable operating business. Not only does it own its uh warehouses, distribution centers on its balance sheet, but it also owns a large chunk of investment property assets as well.
Joe: 我们一直在买入**三菱物流** (Mitsubishi Logistics: 日本一家大型物流公司)，这是一家非常大的物流公司。它的估值非常非常有趣，因为它不仅是一家非常盈利的运营企业，不仅在资产负债表上拥有自己的仓库、配送中心，还拥有一大块投资性房地产资产。

And the combined value of those real estate assets is about twice the current share price. So trading at a very substantial discount, private equity has been very active uh within the logistics space. Mishia logistics trades well below **book value** (账面价值: 公司资产减去负债后的净值，通常指每股净资产) and there's a lot of pressure on companies in Japan to achieve at a minimum one times.
而且这些房地产资产的总价值大约是当前股价的两倍。因此，它以非常大的折价交易，私募股权在物流领域一直非常活跃。三菱物流的交易价格远低于**账面价值** (Book Value: 公司资产减去负债后的净值，通常指每股净资产)，日本公司面临着很大的压力，要求至少达到一倍账面价值。

one of its close peers uh has attracted interest from a a value activist investor and has seen its shares re-rate in response to that to well north of one, one and a half times in fact and so there's pressure building on management of that company to to address their undervaluation.
它的一家紧密竞争对手吸引了价值激进投资者的兴趣，其股价因此重新定价，实际上达到了账面价值的一倍半以上，因此该公司管理层面临着解决其估值过低问题的压力。

We are uh you know intensely engaging with the company. It's all private and constructive at this stage u and we think we we know which direction we're traveling in. I know you're very bottom up, but in Japan, do you worry at all about the political environment or indeed the fiscal environment?
我们正在与该公司进行深入接触。现阶段，所有接触都是私下且建设性的，我们认为我们知道前进的方向。我知道你们是非常**自下而上** (Bottom-up: 一种投资策略，侧重于对单个公司进行深入分析，而不是基于宏观经济或行业趋势)的，但在日本，你是否担心政治环境或财政环境？

Joe: We think about it, but as you say, from our perspective, it's much more about individual companies, the **idiosyncratic source of return** (特质性回报来源: 来源于特定公司或证券而非市场整体的投资回报) that we can generate, which will be positive really regardless of what's going on with the political or fiscal situation.
Joe: 我们会考虑这些，但正如你所说，从我们的角度来看，更多是关于个别公司，以及我们能够产生的**特质性回报来源** (Idiosyncratic Source of Return: 来源于特定公司或证券而非市场整体的投资回报)，这实际上无论政治或财政状况如何，都将是积极的。

Of course, no company operates in a vacuum. They exist in Japan. They're selling into Japan in many cases, but the businesses that that we tend to invest in have got good market positions. They're very profitable. They've got very strong balance sheets and they're trading extremely cheaply.
当然，没有公司是在真空中运作的。它们存在于日本，在许多情况下也在日本销售。但我们倾向于投资的企业拥有良好的市场地位，利润非常丰厚，资产负债表非常强劲，而且交易价格极低。

And uh notwithstanding those those other risks and other factors, there is very substantial upside from a series of self-help measures that we encourage companies to take.
而且，尽管存在其他风险和因素，通过我们鼓励公司采取的一系列自救措施，仍有非常大的上涨空间。

### 全球投资组合：为何美国权重低？

Merryn: Right. Should we go a bit more global? When we look at your global portfolio, one of the things that you tend to focus on is more in the way of **closed-end funds** (封闭式基金: 发行固定数量的股票，并在证券交易所上市交易的投资基金). So in the UK **investment trust** (投资信托: 英国的一种封闭式基金，通常投资于股票、债券或其他资产), **holding companies** (控股公司: 通过持有其他公司的股权来控制这些公司的公司), etc.
Merryn: 好的。我们是不是应该更全球化一点？当我们看你的全球投资组合时，你倾向于关注更多**封闭式基金** (Closed-end Funds: 发行固定数量的股票，并在证券交易所上市交易的投资基金)。所以在英国有**投资信托** (Investment Trust: 英国的一种封闭式基金，通常投资于股票、债券或其他资产)、**控股公司** (Holding Companies: 通过持有其他公司的股权来控制这些公司的公司)等。

When I look at the portfolio, which is quite small, but what is it in the global fund? About 40, 40 holdings. It's quite concentrated.
当我查看投资组合时，它规模很小，但全球基金中有什么呢？大约40个持仓。它相当集中。

Joe: Yeah. Probably 20 core names. Really? 20 core names. 20, 25 core names.
Joe: 是的。大概20个核心名称。真的吗？20个核心名称。20到25个核心名称。

Merryn: All right. If you look at it geographically, you've got much less in the US than pretty much any global trust I look at. You've got more in Europe, more in Japan, more in the UK than most, and very little emerging markets, etc.
Merryn: 好的。如果你从地理上看，你在美国的投资比我看到的大多数全球信托都要少得多。你在欧洲、日本和英国的投资都比大多数信托要多，而在新兴市场等地的投资则非常少。

So, should we just look briefly at why it is that you hold so little in the US relative to the index and relative to other global funds? I know relativity is not your thing at all, but nonetheless, I think it would be interesting for for listeners to to hear a little more about that.
那么，我们能否简单地看看，为什么相对于指数和全球其他基金，你在美国的持仓如此之少？我知道相对论根本不是你的风格，但尽管如此，我认为听众会很乐意多听一些这方面的内容。

Joe: Well, you know, AVI Global is a **benchmark agnostic** (不参考基准: 一种投资策略，不以特定市场指数作为投资组合构建或业绩衡量的基准) trust and we take that claim seriously. So many others would say benchmark agnostic, but when you look at them, they seem to have very similar allocations to the US than the benchmark.
Joe: 嗯，你知道，AVI全球信托是一个**不参考基准** (Benchmark Agnostic: 一种投资策略，不以特定市场指数作为投资组合构建或业绩衡量的基准)的信托，我们认真对待这一说法。许多其他基金会说自己不参考基准，但当你查看它们时，你会发现它们在美国的配置与基准非常相似。

The other factor is that we are bottom up and we can invest where we see the most compelling undervaluations and the most attractive upside. In recent years, that has really led us away from the US and to other places. When you think about it, the starting point I said was always that markets are inefficient.
另一个因素是，我们是自下而上的投资者，我们可以在我们看到最具吸引力的低估值和最大上涨空间的地方进行投资。近年来，这确实使我们远离了美国，转向了其他地方。当你思考这个问题时，我所说的起点始终是市场是低效的。

But when you think about the US market, it is the most popular, largest market in the world. It's the most well-researched market. And the kind of companies that we're looking for, good quality businesses on discounted valuations. So in the US buying a dollar of assets for 50, 60 cents, they're not that common.
但当你想到美国市场时，它是世界上最受欢迎、最大的市场。它是研究最充分的市场。而我们正在寻找的那种公司，是估值被低估的优质企业。所以在美国，以50、60美分的价格购买一美元的资产，这种情况并不常见。

The **price discovery mechanism** (价格发现机制: 市场通过买卖双方的互动来确定资产公允价格的过程), the **sellside research** (卖方研究: 投资银行或经纪公司为客户提供的研究报告和分析，旨在促进交易), the **private equity arbitrage** (私募股权套利: 私募股权基金利用市场定价效率低下，通过收购低估值公司并重组提升价值来获利的行为) taking over, taking advantage of mispriced opportunities that has worked to a great extent whereas other markets really don't have that those uh those factors working in their favor and so we're able to find more value.
**价格发现机制** (Price Discovery Mechanism: 市场通过买卖双方的互动来确定资产公允价格的过程)、**卖方研究** (Sellside Research: 投资银行或经纪公司为客户提供的研究报告和分析，旨在促进交易)、**私募股权套利** (Private Equity Arbitrage: 私募股权基金利用市场定价效率低下，通过收购低估值公司并重组提升价值来获利的行为)等机制，在很大程度上发挥了作用，利用了错误定价的机会，而其他市场却没有这些有利因素，因此我们能够找到更多的价值。

Merryn: So does that make the US a very efficient market or a hideously overpriced market? It's probably got got a little bit of both. But interestingly, um we are seeing more opportunities uh in the US have been the last couple of years. It's not in the popular places. It's not amongst the high growth tech companies.
Merryn: 那么这是否意味着美国是一个非常有效的市场，还是一个价格高得离谱的市场？可能两者兼而有之。但有趣的是，过去几年我们确实在美国看到了更多的机会。这些机会不在热门领域，不在高增长科技公司中。

It tends to be amongst smaller companies. Companies that have the kind of characteristics that you said we favor **investment companies** (投资公司: 专门从事投资各种证券的公司) owning a variety of different businesses trading at a discount to some of the parts.
它往往出现在较小的公司中。这些公司具有你所说的我们偏爱的特征，即拥有各种不同业务的**投资公司** (Investment Companies: 专门从事投资各种证券的公司)，其交易价格低于其部分资产的总和。

But the one thing that works in favor of of the US market is that even in those situations, management is much more focused on the share price. So at the other extreme, Japan management haven't been focused on the share price. They don't care. They don't own shares.
但美国市场的一个有利因素是，即使在这些情况下，管理层也更关注股价。因此，在另一个极端，日本的管理层一直不关注股价。他们不在乎。他们不持有股份。

In the US, what you find is management are very savvy, financially savvy, and if they can see a discount, they will exploit it for their shareholders benefit and hopefully for theirs as well.
在美国，你会发现管理层非常精明，金融知识丰富，如果他们看到折价，他们会利用它为股东谋利，也希望为自己谋利。

### 美国市场的新机会：新闻集团案例

Merryn: Can you give us an example of the kind of thing you've been finding in the US recently? You say you're finding more value there now.
Merryn: 你能给我们举个你最近在美国发现的例子吗？你说你现在在那里找到了更多价值。

Joe: Our largest holding in in is a US listed company which is **News Corporation** (新闻集团: 一家全球性的媒体和信息服务公司), assets more global I would say but News Corp is interesting. It's controlled by the Rupert Murdoch and his family. It has two key assets within the holding company.
Joe: 我们最大的持股是一家在美国上市的公司，即**新闻集团** (News Corporation: 一家全球性的媒体和信息服务公司)，其资产在全球范围内分布更广，但我认为新闻集团很有趣。它由鲁珀特·默多克及其家族控制。这家控股公司旗下有两项关键资产。

The first is an Australian listed business called **REA Group** (REA集团: 澳大利亚一家领先的房地产网站运营商) of which News Corp own around 60 odd percent. It's a very successful business. It's the equivalent of what we have in the UK. Rightmove and it's got a very dominant market share, very profitable and as I say a very successful investment for the group.
第一个是澳大利亚上市的**REA集团** (REA Group: 澳大利亚一家领先的房地产网站运营商)，新闻集团拥有其约60%的股份。这是一家非常成功的企业。它相当于我们在英国的Rightmove，拥有非常主导的市场份额，利润丰厚，正如我所说，是该集团非常成功的投资。

So we know what the value of that is. It trades on the stock market and so we can extract that from the market price of News Corp and look at what the implied value of the other assets are. And there is really only one key asset to think about here and that is the 100% ownership of the **Dow Jones Group** (道琼斯集团: 新闻集团旗下的一个出版部门，拥有《华尔街日报》等). The Dow Jones Group owns the Wall Street Journal.
所以我们知道它的价值是多少。它在股票市场上交易，因此我们可以从新闻集团的市场价格中提取这部分价值，然后看看其他资产的隐含价值是多少。这里实际上只有一个关键资产需要考虑，那就是对**道琼斯集团** (Dow Jones Group: 新闻集团旗下的一个出版部门，拥有《华尔街日报》等)的100%所有权。道琼斯集团拥有《华尔街日报》。

Merryn: Obviously a well-known business, not only a successful newspaper, but also a very successful online online business. But along with the Wall Street Journal, they also own a business called **Opus** (Opus: 一家专注于大宗商品市场的数据提供商), which is a data provider primarily for the um commodities business, oil trading and commodities business.
Merryn: 显然，这是一项众所周知的业务，不仅是一份成功的报纸，也是一项非常成功的在线业务。但除了《华尔街日报》，他们还拥有一个名为**Opus** (Opus: 一家专注于大宗商品市场的数据提供商)的业务，它主要为大宗商品业务、石油交易和商品业务提供数据。

Not too dissimilar to what Bloomberg does, say for equities and bonds, but more focused on the commodities business. Now the implied value when you strip out the market price of REA Group of the Dow Jones business is around four times earnings, four maybe five times earnings. It's certainly worth a lot more than that.
这与彭博社为股票和债券所做的工作不无相似之处，但更侧重于大宗商品业务。现在，当你剔除REA集团和道琼斯业务的市场价格后，其隐含价值约为盈利的四倍，可能是五倍。这当然比那个价值高得多。

If you look at its closest listed peer, the closest listed pier to the Wall Street Journal is the **New York Times** (纽约时报: 美国一家著名报纸和数字新闻机构) which trades at somewhere around 15 to 17 times earnings. So a massive gap.
如果你看看它最接近的上市同行，与《华尔街日报》最接近的上市同行是**《纽约时报》** (New York Times: 美国一家著名报纸和数字新闻机构)，其交易价格约为盈利的15到17倍。所以差距巨大。

Now clearly there are question marks about the family ownership there the alignment of interest the importance in their mind of minority shareholders but I think we focus on what evidence there is out there in the public domain and what's really been interesting about News Corp is the recent comments coming out from the **CEO** (Chief Executive Officer: 首席执行官) who's not a member of the family talking about the undervaluation talking about the discount talking about the strategic review that's ongoing at the board to think about how to address that undervaluation talking about no sacred cows, no holds barred strategic review.
现在，显然，关于家族所有权、利益一致性以及少数股东在他们心目中的重要性都存在疑问。但我认为我们关注的是公开领域存在的证据，而新闻集团真正有趣的是，其非家族成员的**首席执行官** (CEO: Chief Executive Officer)最近发表的评论，谈到了估值过低、折价以及董事会正在进行的战略审查，以思考如何解决这种估值过低的问题，并提到“没有神圣不可侵犯的领域，没有限制的战略审查”。

And probably the the dispute that's been going on in the family has held some of that restructuring back. And hopefully now that that's behind um we can look forward to perhaps some restructuring. But notwithstanding that, and this is really key of what we're looking for across our portfolio, you've got two very good quality businesses within News Corp that are growing in value, that are growing in profitability year in year out.
而且，家族内部持续的争议可能阻碍了部分重组。希望现在这些都已成为过去，我们可以期待一些重组。但尽管如此，这也是我们整个投资组合中寻找的关键：新闻集团内部有两项非常优质的业务，它们年复一年地增值，盈利能力也在增长。

So the **NAV** (Net Asset Value: 资产净值) side of things is growing. The discount is wide. It's 45%. It's extremely wide. And we think the discount will be addressed. We can't determine when that is going to be addressed. But the key whilst we're waiting at least is to have that pound of value increasing rather than be stuck in a **value trap** (价值陷阱: 指一只股票看起来便宜，但其价格却持续下跌，因为它所投资的资产价值正在缩水) where you own a pound of assets that's going south and it becomes a race against time to monetize that discount.
因此，**资产净值** (NAV: Net Asset Value)方面正在增长。折价幅度很大，达到45%，非常之大。我们认为折价问题会得到解决。我们无法确定何时能解决。但在等待期间，关键至少是让这一英镑的价值不断增长，而不是陷入**价值陷阱** (Value Trap: 指一只股票看起来便宜，但其价格却持续下跌，因为它所投资的资产价值正在缩水)，即你持有的资产价值不断缩水，从而变成一场与时间赛跑以变现折价的竞赛。

Merryn: Yeah. But this is an example, this kind of investment. This is a company where you as a firm can't really create the catalyst yourself.
Merryn: 是的。但这种投资就是一个例子。这是一家你们公司无法真正自行创造催化剂的公司。

Joe: Correct.
Joe: 没错。

Merryn: You have to stand back and wait for it to happen.
Merryn: 你必须退后一步，等待它的发生。

Joe: Yeah. And in those kind of situations, what we're looking for is the belief that something is going to happen. And it's more than just a belief that something is going to happen because it's the right thing to do. It's looking for those explicit indicators from management that they are doing a strategic review, that they're bothered about the discount, that actually something is going to happen.
Joe: 是的。在这种情况下，我们寻找的是相信会发生一些事情。而且这不仅仅是相信会发生一些事情，因为这是正确的事情。它是在寻找管理层明确的指示，表明他们正在进行战略审查，他们对折价感到困扰，实际上会有一些事情发生。

Because otherwise you're just left with hope and that's not good enough. And the exciting thing from about our opportunity set today is that there are so many companies trading on wide discounts where there is something happening. We don't know exactly the timing in all situations but we know that something is happening which is a big turnaround from I don't know 15 years ago when there was a lot of value on offer but um it wasn't clear it wasn't apparent what was going to happen to unlock that value.
因为否则你就只剩下希望，那是不够的。而我们今天机会集合中令人兴奋的一点是，有如此多的公司以大幅折价交易，而且正在发生一些事情。我们不确定所有情况下的确切时机，但我们知道有事情正在发生，这与15年前相比是一个巨大的转变，那时有很多价值可供选择，但却不清楚，不明显会发生什么来释放这些价值。

### 私募股权投资信托：利用折价与积极参与

Merryn: Can we talk speaking of unlocking value about the private equity exposure in the portfolio? So that's an an area where there's lots of private equity investment trust in the UK trading on slightly lower or higher lower discounts than they were previously but nonetheless there's a lot about and you hold quite a lot in the portfolio that has private equity exposure right
Merryn: 谈到释放价值，我们能谈谈投资组合中的私募股权风险敞口吗？这是一个英国有很多私募股权投资信托的领域，它们的交易折价幅度比以前略低或略高，但无论如何，这个领域有很多机会，而且你的投资组合中持有相当多的私募股权风险敞口，对吗？

Joe: yeah we became more interested I would say in the private equity trusts probably two or three years ago at a time when interest rates started going up you started seeing share prices come down and you started seeing discounts widen and what was interesting to us at a point in time was discounts were in some cases 40 to 50%.
Joe: 是的，我想说，我们大约在两三年前开始对私募股权信托更感兴趣，当时利率开始上升，股价开始下跌，折价幅度也开始扩大。当时我们觉得有趣的是，在某些情况下，折价幅度高达40%到50%。

And there was obviously a debate about what the NAVs were but we could see when looking at the **secondaries market** (二级市场: 指已发行证券进行交易的市场，此处特指私募股权基金份额的二级交易市场). So the secondary market provides good pricing evidence of what investors are buying in some cases some of those very same underlying funds that the private equity funds themselves own.
显然，关于**资产净值** (NAV: Net Asset Value)是什么存在争议，但当我们观察**二级市场** (Secondaries Market: 指已发行证券进行交易的市场，此处特指私募股权基金份额的二级交易市场)时，我们能看到情况。二级市场提供了很好的定价证据，表明投资者在购买什么，在某些情况下，正是私募股权基金本身所拥有的那些相同的底层基金。

And they were trading probably at 5 to 10 percent discounts to reported Navs. So in our mind we could see quite a dislocation between how the market was pricing the private equity funds themselves and what was really going on by in some cases in quite sophisticated investors.
它们当时的交易价格可能比报告的资产净值低5%到10%。所以在我们看来，市场对私募股权基金本身的定价，与在某些情况下非常成熟的投资者实际操作之间，存在相当大的脱节。

So that gave us some confidence that the NAVs weren't as unrealistic as perhaps some investors had feared. And then for us the question is we're not asset allocating. We're not just picking up stakes in in listed private equity funds for the sake of it. We want to add some value for our shareholders.
这给了我们一些信心，认为资产净值可能不像一些投资者担心的那样不切实际。然后对我们来说，问题是，我们不是在进行资产配置。我们不是为了持有而持有上市私募股权基金的股份。我们希望为我们的股东增加一些价值。

And typically the value we add to our shareholders whenever we we invest in other investment trusts is some form of shareholder engagement, some form of shareholder activism. And that typically arises when we can be a large dominant shareholder, if not the largest than let's just say a top three shareholder.
通常，每当我们投资其他投资信托时，我们为股东增加的价值是某种形式的股东参与，某种形式的股东积极主义。这种情况通常发生在我们能够成为一个主要的控股股东时，如果不是最大的，至少也是前三大股东。

And so what we've seen and I think we we've played our part in this is a sector that's now more aware of **capital allocations** (资本配置: 公司决定如何将可用资金分配到各种投资和运营活动中的过程). You're seeing more and more private equity funds doing **share buybacks** (股票回购: 公司从市场上购回自身股票的行为，通常旨在减少流通股数量，提升每股收益和股价).
因此，我们所看到的，我认为我们在这其中发挥了作用，是一个现在更了解**资本配置** (Capital Allocations: 公司决定如何将可用资金分配到各种投资和运营活动中的过程)的行业。你看到越来越多的私募股权基金进行**股票回购** (Share Buybacks: 公司从市场上购回自身股票的行为，通常旨在减少流通股数量，提升每股收益和股价)。

We are pressing companies to take advantage of those discounts by rather than make new investments by their own portfolios on very steep discounts which is a positive risk-free return that's hard to beat elsewhere. And we're still seeing a number of attractive opportunities.
我们正在敦促公司利用这些折价，而不是通过自己的投资组合进行新的投资，而是以非常大的折价回购自己的股票，这是一种积极的无风险回报，在其他地方很难超越。我们仍然看到许多有吸引力的机会。

Merryn: Okay. In private equity business as a whole, the sector seems to be in some degree of trouble. Exits increasingly difficult. **IPO market** (首次公开募股市场: 公司首次向公众发行股票以筹集资金的市场) still jammed up. So when you look at the sector as a whole, you might think, well, it's not really somewhere I want to be, but you're happy with it because you're buying on such big discounts.
Merryn: 好的。就整个私募股权业务而言，这个行业似乎在某种程度上陷入困境。退出越来越困难，**首次公开募股市场** (IPO Market: 公司首次向公众发行股票以筹集资金的市场)仍然停滞不前。所以当你审视整个行业时，你可能会觉得，嗯，这不是我真正想进入的领域，但你却乐在其中，因为你正在以如此大的折价买入。

Joe: We're happy buying either trusts that own you know relative concentrated portfolios of businesses that we can analyze and comfortable with the valuations of those businesses. So something like **Oakley Capital** (奥克利资本: 一家私募股权投资公司) for example, a fairly transparent portfolio, an excellent track record and attractive valuation as well.
Joe: 我们乐于购买那些拥有相对集中业务组合的信托，这些业务我们可以分析并对其估值感到满意。例如，像**奥克利资本** (Oakley Capital: 一家私募股权投资公司)这样的公司，其投资组合相当透明，业绩记录出色，估值也很有吸引力。

or some of the more diversified listed private equity funds where the discounts are very wide. And it's really up to us to engage with the board to do more to take advantage of those wide discounts by buying back shares, but be more shareholder friendly, more focused on the share price and take action on that.
或者一些更分散的上市私募股权基金，它们的折价非常大。我们确实需要与董事会接触，促使他们采取更多行动，通过回购股票来利用这些巨大的折价，并更加注重股东利益，更关注股价，并对此采取行动。

Merryn: And how do the boards of those investment trusts enjoy that interaction with you?
Merryn: 那些投资信托的董事会如何看待与你们的这种互动呢？

Joe: Obviously, it's mixed. You know, I think for us though, the starting point is we never want to be an aggressive bully. It always works best to be polite, to be constructive, and that is helped by the fact that we typically like the portfolios we own. We typically like the underlying businesses.
Joe: 显然，情况好坏参半。你知道，不过我认为对我们来说，出发点是我们绝不想成为一个咄咄逼人的恶霸。礼貌和建设性总是最好的方式，而这得益于我们通常喜欢我们持有的投资组合。我们通常喜欢这些基础业务。

And it's not a case of a pound of assets that's going south very quickly, which would make us which would force us really to be aggressive. It's more we can be patient. We just want to see companies start to do more of the right thing.
而且，这并非是资产价值迅速缩水的情况，那会迫使我们变得激进。更多的是我们可以保持耐心。我们只是希望看到公司开始做更多正确的事情。

Merryn: Okay.
Merryn: 好的。

Joe: Clearly, the investment trust space generally has suffered an **exodus of shareholders** (股东流失: 大量股东退出某项投资或某个行业). It's why we see so many discounts. There's in some cases there's a lack of buyers, you could say. But what's interesting is that more investors, more shareholders alongside us are becoming engaged as well.
Joe: 显然，投资信托领域普遍经历了**股东流失** (Exodus of Shareholders: 大量股东退出某项投资或某个行业)。这就是我们看到这么多折价的原因。在某些情况下，可以说缺乏买家。但有趣的是，越来越多的投资者、越来越多的股东与我们一起积极参与。

They found their voice and they're recognizing that their **remit** (职责范围) to their own stakeholders is to be proactive, not just to be accepting of wide discounts. And one of the things we we do is get together with other shareholders, write joint letters to boards.
他们找到了自己的声音，并且认识到他们对自身利益相关者的**职责范围** (Remit)是积极主动，而不仅仅是接受大额折价。我们所做的一件事就是与其他股东一起，向董事会发出联名信。

It just makes obviously life a little bit more challenging for boards, but it makes it more a more constructive dialogue. It was never this bad in in the UK, but in Japan, for example, whenever you had a go or you criticized management, they'd always say, "You're the only shareholder who's not happy. All my other shareholders tell me they love me." Doing things together with other shareholders can be very powerful.
这显然会给董事会带来一些挑战，但它能促成更具建设性的对话。在英国，情况从未如此糟糕，但在日本，例如，每当你尝试或批评管理层时，他们总是会说：“你是不开心的唯一股东。我所有其他股东都告诉我他们爱我。”与其他股东一起行动会非常强大。

### 英国投资信托的未来：机构与散户

Merryn: Let's stick with investment trust for a minute because a lot of our listeners are investment trust investors. What happens to the investment trust sector as a whole in the UK? Does it just shrink right back until we have a much smaller sector focused mainly on a liquid assets or is there another route for it?
Merryn: 让我们暂时停留在投资信托上，因为我们的很多听众都是投资信托的投资者。英国的投资信托行业整体会发生什么？它会一直萎缩，直到我们拥有一个主要专注于流动性资产的小得多的行业，还是有其他的出路？

Joe: No, I think I'm more positive than that. I think it plays a very important role and we're going through a shift clearly in order to be relevant, funds have to be of a certain size and probably the days of the very small trusts trading on very wide discounts that they might find their days numbered.
Joe: 不，我认为我比那更积极。我认为它扮演着非常重要的角色，我们正在经历一个明显的转变，为了保持相关性，基金必须达到一定的规模，而那些交易折价非常大的小型信托的日子可能屈指可数了。

Merryn: Can I just pick up on on that? We've been saying this for ages, haven't we? That to be relevant in investment trust now has to be much bigger than it used to be. And we used to say, well, it has to be 400 million pounds to be relevant. Then that has to be close to a billion to be relevant etc etc but that assumes that the audience for investment trust is quite **institutional** (机构投资者: 如养老基金、保险公司、共同基金等大型专业投资者).
Merryn: 我能就这一点插一句吗？我们早就这么说了，不是吗？现在的投资信托若想保持相关性，其规模必须比以前大得多。我们以前常说，它必须达到4亿英镑才能有相关性。然后又说必须接近10亿英镑才能有相关性等等，但这假设投资信托的受众主要是**机构投资者** (Institutional: 如养老基金、保险公司、共同基金等大型专业投资者)。

If you assume that there's a shift underway in this sector and in fact the market for investment trust is much more the ordinary man in the street the **retail investor** (散户投资者: 个人投资者，通常资金量较小，非专业投资机构) then it doesn't have to be a particular size. You can be a£100 million and still be very attractive to the retail investor.
如果你认为这个行业正在发生转变，实际上投资信托的市场更多是普通大众，即**散户投资者** (Retail Investor: 个人投资者，通常资金量较小，非专业投资机构)，那么它就不必达到特定的规模。你可以是1亿英镑的规模，但对散户投资者仍然非常有吸引力。

You only have to be big if you have large **wealth managers** (财富管理经理: 为高净值个人或家庭提供综合金融服务和投资建议的专业人士) wanting to be invested in you which increasingly doesn't seem to be the case anyway.
你只有在有大型**财富管理经理** (Wealth Managers: 为高净值个人或家庭提供综合金融服务和投资建议的专业人士)希望投资你时才需要做大，但现在看来这种情况越来越少见了。

Joe: Yes, that's true. But the question then becomes, how does the sector as a whole attract that person on the street, that retail investor?
Joe: 是的，这是真的。但问题随之而来，整个行业如何吸引街上的那个人，那个散户投资者呢？

Merryn: Sorry, Tik Tok.
Merryn: 抱歉，抖音。

Joe: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. The younger generation of investor today, one has to reach them in different ways to the ways of even 10 years ago, five, even five years ago. They are in many ways confused about investment trusts because they're more comfortable with the **open-ended world** (开放式基金: 一种可以随时申购和赎回份额的投资基金，其份额数量不固定) where something is worth a pound and you buy it for a pound and then you sell it for a pound.
Joe: 是的。没错。没错。今天的年轻一代投资者，必须以不同于十年前、五年前甚至仅仅五年前的方式接触他们。他们在很多方面对投资信托感到困惑，因为他们更习惯于**开放式基金** (Open-ended World: 一种可以随时申购和赎回份额的投资基金，其份额数量不固定)的世界，在那里，某物值一英镑，你以一英镑买入，再以一英镑卖出。

This whole idea that it's worth a pound and I can buy it for 90p but when I want to sell it it's 80p that's just weird fun though. It is great fun and but the problem is that the investors who like it and find it fun and the one who you know the ones who don't care whether something is 50 million or 500 million they're getting old and then they're taking their money out of the sector or it's disappearing in other ways.
这种“它值一英镑，我可以用90便士买，但我想卖的时候却只值80便士”的想法，虽然奇怪，但也有趣。确实很有趣，但问题是，喜欢它并觉得有趣的投资者，以及那些不在乎是5000万还是5亿的投资者，他们正在变老，然后他们将资金撤出这个行业，或者资金通过其他方式消失了。

So you do have to attract the retail investor. The retail investor is key and the sector as a whole has to do more to appeal to those retail investors. The wealth managers. Yeah, the problem is being relevant to the wealth managers, but even there we're seeing some shifts.
所以你确实必须吸引散户投资者。散户投资者是关键，整个行业必须做更多工作来吸引这些散户投资者。财富管理经理。是的，问题在于对财富管理经理保持相关性，但即使在那方面，我们也看到了一些转变。

So, the consolidation in the ret in the wealth management sector has meant that most trusts aren't relevant. If you're running 50 billion or 100 billion, even a billion pound trust is not going to solve your problem of how to allocate to global equities say.
因此，财富管理行业的整合意味着大多数信托不再具有相关性。如果你管理着500亿或1000亿英镑的资产，即使是一个10亿英镑的信托也无法解决你如何配置全球股票的问题。

But the whole centralization that's going on there and again the whole focus on open-ended funds within those wealth managers has meant that many individual wealth managers are leaving. They're going to more **boutique type firms** (精品型公司: 规模较小但专注于特定领域或提供定制化服务的公司). Exactly. To take advantage of the kind of situations that you say.
但那里正在发生的整个集中化，以及财富管理经理对开放式基金的整体关注，意味着许多个人财富管理经理正在离职。他们转向了更多的**精品型公司** (Boutique Type Firms: 规模较小但专注于特定领域或提供定制化服务的公司)。没错。正是为了利用你所说的那种情况。

Merryn: That's some good news. Thank you for that. Let's move on to another bit of good news, which is your shift towards **Korea** (韩国). I know you've recently been on a trip and I'm wondering if you're looking at Korea now and seeing the same kind of opportunities that you might have seen in Japan a few years back.
Merryn: 那是些好消息。谢谢你。让我们转向另一个好消息，那就是你转向**韩国** (Korea)。我知道你最近去旅行了，我想知道你现在看韩国，是否看到了几年前在日本可能看到的那种机会。

### 韩国市场：新政府推动的变革与投资机遇

Joe: Yeah, we're we're very excited about Korea. It's a market we've been looking at for a few years. It's looked very cheap for a very long time, but like Japan 10 years ago, it lacked a catalyst. Nothing ever changed except that prices got cheaper.
Joe: 是的，我们对韩国非常兴奋。这是一个我们已经关注了几年的市场。它看起来非常便宜很长时间了，但就像十年前的日本一样，它缺乏一个催化剂。除了价格变得更便宜之外，什么都没有改变。

And we've now actually put around 8% of the global trust in into Korean names. We own seven or eight different businesses there. And the reason why we've done that is because the new government in Korea has brought into place a number of laws and regulations and intends to do more in order to promote stock market ownership in order to limit the power of **controlling shareholders** (控股股东: 持有公司大部分股权，能够对公司决策施加重大影响的股东) which has been a big negative of the market and has weighed on share prices and to address undervaluation of companies on the stock market as well.
我们现在实际上已经将全球信托约8%的资金投入到韩国股票中。我们在那里拥有七八家不同的企业。我们这样做的原因是，韩国新政府已经出台了一系列法律法规，并打算做更多工作，以促进股市所有权，限制**控股股东** (Controlling Shareholders: 持有公司大部分股权，能够对公司决策施加重大影响的股东)的权力，后者一直是市场的一大负面因素，并对股价造成压力，同时解决股市公司估值过低的问题。

Interestingly, the new president came in on a platform of of **Cosby 5000** (韩国综合股价指数5000点: 指韩国股市主要指数达到5000点的目标), aiming to to get the Cosby to double from when the point when he came into power within 5 years, which is remarkable.
有趣的是，新总统上任时提出了**韩国综合股价指数5000点** (COSPI 5000: 指韩国股市主要指数达到5000点的目标)的政纲，目标是在他上任五年内，将韩国综合股价指数翻一番，这非常了不起。

Merryn: Yeah.
Merryn: 是的。

Joe: And they're pursuing a **carrot and stick approach** (胡萝卜加大棒政策: 结合奖励和惩罚的策略来促使行为改变) to regulations. So, there'll be some things like **tax incentives** (税收优惠: 政府为鼓励特定行为而提供的税收减免或优惠) to pay out **dividends** (股息: 公司向股东支付的利润份额). That's a carrot. The stick would be forcing companies to cancel sh cancel **treasury shares** (库存股: 公司购回但尚未注销的自身股票) as opposed to letting them blindly accumulate.
Joe: 他们正在对法规采取**胡萝卜加大棒政策** (Carrot and Stick Approach: 结合奖励和惩罚的策略来促使行为改变)。因此，会有一些措施，比如支付**股息** (Dividends: 公司向股东支付的利润份额)的**税收优惠** (Tax Incentives: 政府为鼓励特定行为而提供的税收减免或优惠)。这是胡萝卜。而大棒则是强制公司注销**库存股** (Treasury Shares: 公司购回但尚未注销的自身股票)，而不是任由它们盲目积累。

Merryn: Okay. Will there be a dedicated Korean trust from you given that that seems to be the signal?
Merryn: 好的。鉴于这似乎是个信号，你会推出一个专门的韩国信托吗？

Joe: No plans as yet, but you're not the first person to ask about that.
Joe: 目前还没有计划，但你不是第一个问这个问题的人。

Merryn: God, you can't say that. It makes me feel small when you say I'm not the first person to ask the question.
Merryn: 天哪，你不能这么说。你说我不是第一个问这个问题的人，这让我觉得自己很渺小。

Joe: Uh, well, we haven't spoken for a while, so otherwise I would have told you.
Joe: 嗯，我们有一段时间没说话了，不然我早就告诉你了。

Merryn: Okay, fair enough. Tell us about some of the specific companies that you've been picking up in Korea.
Merryn: 好的，很公平。告诉我们你最近在韩国挑选的一些具体公司。

Joe: Yeah, well, we own one company called **Amore Pacific** (爱茉莉太平洋: 韩国一家大型化妆品集团), which is a holding company controlled by a family and its main asset. So there's a Moria Pacific Holdings and there's a Moria Pacific Corporation which is the main asset which is a lead in cosmetics business in Korea and Korean cosmetics and skincare generally I'm told is extremely popular.
Joe: 是的，我们拥有一家名为**爱茉莉太平洋** (Amore Pacific: 韩国一家大型化妆品集团)的公司，它是一家由家族控制的控股公司，其主要资产是爱茉莉太平洋控股公司和爱茉莉太平洋公司，后者是韩国化妆品业务的领导者，据说韩国化妆品和护肤品普遍非常受欢迎。

Merryn: Oh it is Joe. It is extremely popular. It is extremely popular. A lot of our listeners I know they all have brilliance. Again they'll be using Korean products.
Merryn: 哦，它确实很受欢迎，乔。它非常受欢迎。我知道我们的许多听众都很聪明。他们也会使用韩国产品。

Joe: They will. So again the operating business is listed. So the holding company trades at about a 40% discount to the value of its operating business which it controls and this is typical in in Korea. There's a lot of family controlled holding businesses. Obviously the the large Samsung and LG and SK the large **chables** (财阀: 韩国特有的大型家族式企业集团) are well known this is perhaps a less well-known company but the idea of family ownership and um yeah the issue in Korea is that in many cases families see these businesses even though they're listed as their own personal thiefts and they don't care about minority shareholders and a lot of the regulation that's coming in is designed to address that.
Joe: 他们会的。所以，运营业务再次上市。因此，这家控股公司的交易价格比其控制的运营业务的价值低约40%，这在韩国很常见。韩国有很多家族控制的控股企业。显然，大型的三星、LG和SK等**财阀** (Chaebols: 韩国特有的大型家族式企业集团)众所周知，这可能是一家不太知名的公司，但家族所有权以及在韩国，许多情况下，家族即使这些企业已上市，仍将其视为自己的私人领地，他们不关心少数股东，而许多即将出台的法规就是为了解决这个问题。

So encouraging something like a Moro Pacific to pay more dividends to reduce cash on the balance sheet, to cancel **treasury shares** (库存股: 公司购回但尚未注销的自身股票), and just to promote the interest of minority shareholders. There's a law that's being passed in Korea recently that restricts the votes of any shareholder to 3% when it comes to voting for **independent independent directors** (独立董事: 不受公司管理层或控股股东控制，独立于公司执行层面的董事) and **independent auditors** (独立审计师: 对公司财务报表进行独立审查，确保其真实性和准确性的专业人士) on the board.
因此，鼓励像爱茉莉太平洋这样的公司支付更多股息，减少资产负债表上的现金，注销**库存股** (Treasury Shares: 公司购回但尚未注销的自身股票)，以及仅仅是为了促进少数股东的利益。韩国最近通过了一项法律，规定在投票选举董事会的**独立董事** (Independent Directors: 不受公司管理层或控股股东控制，独立于公司执行层面的董事)和**独立审计师** (Independent Auditors: 对公司财务报表进行独立审查，确保其真实性和准确性的专业人士)时，任何股东的投票权不得超过3%。

So that is a direct response to the perception that large family controlled companies are only run for the families and not minority shareholders. So it doesn't address everything but it's a very clear signal and clear step in the right direction.
这直接回应了人们认为大型家族控制公司只为家族利益而非少数股东利益服务的看法。所以它不能解决所有问题，但它是一个非常明确的信号，也是朝着正确方向迈出的明确一步。

Merryn: And what about your activist tendencies? How do you engage with Korean companies?
Merryn: 那么你的激进主义倾向呢？你如何与韩国公司互动？

Joe: Well, the activism element of it is key as well utilizing the support of the new laws and new regulations that are coming into place. It empowers those conversations and makes them direct and much more realistic.
Joe: 嗯，激进主义元素也至关重要，它利用了即将生效的新法律和新法规的支持。这赋予了这些对话力量，使其更直接、更现实。

The reason we see a lot of parallels to Japan is that change takes time. Companies don't change overnight. Families don't change their attitudes immediately. There are some things that they will have to change if the law tells them to, but other things they'll have to be persuaded that it's the right thing to do. Yeah. So dialogue with these companies is very much on the agenda.
我们之所以看到与日本有许多相似之处，是因为改变需要时间。公司不会一夜之间改变。家族也不会立即改变他们的态度。有些事情，如果法律要求他们改变，他们就必须改变，但其他事情，他们必须被说服这是正确的事情。是的。所以与这些公司的对话非常重要。

We are very early days in that respect but we've met a number of different companies and the dialogue starts.
在这方面我们还处于非常早期的阶段，但我们已经与多家不同的公司进行了会面，对话已经开始。

### 英国投资：价值何在？

Merryn: Good. All right. Let's talk about an economy and where the regulation is going or normally goes only in the other direction the UK where you do have again a slightly higher exposure than most global funds. You're what 10 11% at the moment. Where's the value here?
Merryn: 好的。那么，我们来谈谈一个经济体，以及监管的方向，或者通常只是向另一个方向发展的英国。在那里，你们的风险敞口再次略高于大多数全球基金。目前大约是10%到11%。这里的价值在哪里？

Joe: Well again for it's very much a bottom up case for us.
Joe: 嗯，对我们来说，这又是一个非常自下而上的案例。

Merryn: Mhm.
Merryn: 嗯。

Joe: We've had some investments in the property listed property sector, property fund sector where we've seen and continue to see some consolidation and pressure on companies to either merge, take over others, or liquidate assets and return cash to shareholders.
Joe: 我们在上市房地产板块、房地产基金板块进行了一些投资，在那里我们看到并将继续看到一些整合，以及公司面临合并、收购其他公司，或清算资产并将现金返还给股东的压力。

We have a stake in a family-backed UK business uh the retailer **Frasers** (弗雷泽斯: 英国一家零售集团) which has obviously a well-known retail operation but also substantial asset backing in the form of a growing real estate portfolio and stakes in other businesses. Uh and we have a stake in uh **Entain** (恩泰因: 英国一家在线博彩公司) the online gambling company which is listed in the UK.
我们持有一家由家族支持的英国企业——零售商**弗雷泽斯** (Frasers: 英国一家零售集团)的股份，它显然拥有知名的零售业务，但也拥有以不断增长的房地产投资组合和对其他业务的持股形式的实质性资产支持。此外，我们还持有在英国上市的在线博彩公司**恩泰因** (Entain: 英国一家在线博彩公司)的股份。

Merryn: And do you have concerns? I know I asked you this about Japan but I do have to ask you about the UK as well. political, the fiscal environment, the inflation, all these things don't seem to create a great environment for corporate improvement. Do you worry about that? Where are your concerns?
Merryn: 你有顾虑吗？我知道我问过你关于日本的问题，但我也不得不问你关于英国的问题。政治、财政环境、通货膨胀，所有这些似乎都没有为企业改善创造一个良好的环境。你担心这些吗？你的顾虑在哪里？

Joe: Yeah, I live in the UK, so I'm desperately worried about it. And yeah, it's a big worry. What's interesting about the UK market though is that despite the big picture concerns and in some cases quite negative headwinds, there is still a very active market for **corporate control** (公司控制权: 拥有对公司运营和战略决策施加影响或控制的能力).
Joe: 是的，我住在英国，所以我非常担心。是的，这是一个很大的担忧。不过，英国市场有趣的是，尽管存在宏观层面的担忧，在某些情况下也面临相当不利的逆风，但**公司控制权** (Corporate Control: 拥有对公司运营和战略决策施加影响或控制的能力)的市场仍然非常活跃。

You're seeing private equity getting quite involved trying to take advantage of situations and that that's quite positive. That's what we haven't seen in in in other parts of the world necessarily and that gives one confidence that if you can buy good quality assets on a discount then maybe something will happen to address that. So that's the one positive I would say.
你看到私募股权非常积极地参与进来，试图利用这些情况，这相当积极。这不一定是我们世界其他地方所看到的，它让人有信心，如果你能以折价买入优质资产，那么也许会发生一些事情来解决这个问题。所以这是我能说的一个积极因素。

### 投资组合的防御性与风险考量

Merryn: Okay. Yeah. I'm afraid that's quite a vague positive in the round in the round. So we've talked a lot about the positive feelings you have things that might work why it's all working. You've had wonderful performance. When you look at your portfolio in the round, what is it that you're nervous about? What worries you?
Merryn: 好的。是的。恐怕这在整体上是一个相当模糊的积极因素。我们谈了很多你积极的感受，可能会奏效的事情，以及为什么一切都奏效。你的表现非常出色。当你全面审视你的投资组合时，你有什么感到不安的？你担心什么？

If there were, for example, if it were to transpire that there is, for example, a bubble in in AI in the US and perhaps more globally and that were to collapse, for example, what would happen to your portfolio? How defensive is this portfolio? It's not jammed with gold, but how defensive is it for an investor at the moment who is worried, as I think all our listeners are right now, very worried about all the things that they see around them.
例如，如果美国乃至全球的AI领域出现泡沫并破裂，你的投资组合会怎样？这个投资组合的防御性如何？它没有塞满黄金，但对于目前担心地缘政治、美国风险、AI过度曝光、估值等问题的投资者来说，它的防御性如何？我相信我们所有的听众现在都很担心他们周围看到的一切。

They're worried about geopolitics. They're worried about their US exposure. They're worried about AI overexposure. They're worried about valuations. There's a long list out there.
他们担心地缘政治。他们担心他们在美国的风险敞口。他们担心AI过度暴露。他们担心估值。那里有一长串清单。

Joe: Yeah, it's a it's a good question. And I think the point is that we are an **equity portfolio** (股票投资组合: 由多种股票组成的投资组合) and we are fully invested in equities. We would argue that our equities are much cheaper than certain parts of the market. But I think it would be naive to assume that the very expensive tech companies for example would correct and our portfolio would be unaffected by that.
Joe: 是的，这是个好问题。我认为关键在于我们是一个**股票投资组合** (Equity Portfolio: 由多种股票组成的投资组合)，我们完全投资于股票。我们会辩称，我们的股票比市场某些部分便宜得多。但我认为，如果假设那些非常昂贵的科技公司会回调，而我们的投资组合不会受到影响，那将是天真的。

So clearly there's a there's an element of **beta** (贝塔系数: 衡量股票或投资组合相对于市场整体波动性的指标) market exposure and we would probably suffer some declines in that eventuality as well. Whether they'd be greater or not or less is really hard to say. The things that give me some confidence are the fact that when you look at our portfolio and we measure the discount on each of our companies and so we have a picture of what the **weighted average discount** (加权平均折价: 投资组合中所有资产折价率的加权平均值) on our portfolio is now compared to what it is over time and where it's at at the moment is around 37, 38% but to put that into some historical context it's rarely pierced that 40% level and it's been as narrow as 10% and for a few weeks during the co sell off it for a few days rather it touched 45 but if you look back at the **financial crisis** (金融危机: 指2008年全球金融危机) and the **euro crisis** (欧元区危机: 指2010年代初期欧元区主权债务危机) it rarely went below beyond the 40% level and what that says is that discounts are already pretty wide.
所以显然存在**贝塔系数** (Beta: 衡量股票或投资组合相对于市场整体波动性的指标)的市场敞口，在这种情况下，我们可能也会遭受一些下跌。至于跌幅是更大还是更小，真的很难说。让我有信心的是，当你查看我们的投资组合，我们衡量每家公司的折价，从而了解我们投资组合当前的**加权平均折价** (Weighted Average Discount: 投资组合中所有资产折价率的加权平均值)与历史水平相比如何。目前大约是37%到38%，但从历史背景来看，它很少突破40%的水平，曾窄至10%，在疫情抛售的几天里曾触及45%，但如果你回顾**金融危机** (Financial Crisis: 指2008年全球金融危机)和**欧元区危机** (Euro Crisis: 指2010年代初期欧元区主权债务危机)时期，它也很少超过40%的水平，这说明折价已经相当大了。

And coupled with underlying valuations that I think are reasonable and not stretched at all what I think could happen is you might see in the eventuality of a big market correction yes discounts could widen temporarily and our share prices could fall.
再结合我认为合理且完全没有被高估的内在估值，我认为可能会发生的情况是，在市场大幅回调的情况下，折价可能会暂时扩大，我们的股价也可能下跌。

But they're more likely to bounce back pretty quickly because they're they are already at extreme undervaluations. And the reason why it never really goes beyond 40% is at those kind of levels, you start seeing quite attractive entry points and people start taking advantage of that. So I think if our portfolio was trading on a 10% weighted average discount, I'd be much more worried.
但它们很可能会很快反弹，因为它们已经处于极度低估的状态。而它从未真正突破40%的原因是，在那种水平上，你会开始看到非常有吸引力的买入点，人们会开始利用这一点。所以我想，如果我们的投资组合以10%的加权平均折价交易，我会更担心。

### 黄金与比特币：非核心策略

Merryn: Good. Very reassuring. One thing that a lot of our listeners do hold a lot of and it's not in this portfolio though is gold. I know and not necessarily your remit. But how do you feel about the gold sector at the moment? It's been a wonderful run. Hopefully all our listeners are doing extremely well out of that which is a bad thing by the way.
Merryn: 好的。非常令人安心。我们的许多听众都持有大量黄金，但这不在你的投资组合中。我知道这不一定是你的职责范围。但你目前对黄金板块有何看法？它一直表现出色。希望我们所有的听众都从中获利丰厚，顺便说一句，这不是好事。

You don't want gold to go up. It tells you terrible things. But nonetheless, should they worry about that now? It's gone too far. Should they buy more mining companies? Maybe they should swap into silver. I don't know. What do you think?
你不会希望黄金上涨。它会告诉你一些可怕的事情。但尽管如此，他们现在应该担心吗？它涨得太高了。他们应该购买更多的矿业公司吗？也许他们应该换成白银。我不知道。你觉得呢？

Joe: Uh, you know more about it than I do. It looks like gold mining companies are cheap.
Joe: 嗯，你比我更了解它。看起来黄金矿业公司很便宜。

Merryn: Would you buy them though?
Merryn: 但你会买它们吗？

Joe: I wouldn't buy them for AVI Global, though.
Joe: 不过，我不会为AVI全球信托购买它们。

Merryn: Would you buy some Bitcoin for AVI Global?
Merryn: 你会为AVI全球信托购买一些比特币吗？

Joe: Oh, that's definitely not. But it's a sore point in my household.
Joe: 哦，那绝对不会。但这在我们家里是一个痛处。

Merryn: Why?
Merryn: 为什么？

Joe: Oh, because I've been long warning everybody in my family not to touch it and it's going to crash. And a couple of members did buy a little bit of Bitcoin some years ago and they're laughing. Well, they're not cuz they didn't buy enough cuz they didn't. They didn't buy enough.
Joe: 哦，因为我一直警告我家里所有人不要碰它，它会崩溃的。几年前有几个家庭成员确实买了一点比特币，他们现在在笑。嗯，他们没有笑，因为他们没有买够。他们没有买够。

Merryn: Exactly. I mean, I'm always smug on this podcast because I have some Bitcoin and John doesn't have any Bitcoin. But what I very rarely admit is just how little Bitcoin I have. I can I'm smug about it, but it's tiny. But at least it's something. It's something. Whatever happen whatever happens next. Joe, is there anything we've missed? Anything that you must tell us that I have not asked you? Please show up my inadequacies as an interviewer by pointing out you want to know.
Merryn: 没错。我是说，我在这个播客上总是沾沾自喜，因为我有一些比特币，而约翰没有任何比特币。但我很少承认的是我拥有的比特币是多么的少。我可以为此沾沾自喜，但它微不足道。但至少它聊胜于无。聊胜于无。无论接下来发生什么。乔，我们有没有漏掉什么？有什么你必须告诉我们但我没有问你的吗？请指出你希望知道的，以揭示我作为采访者的不足。

Joe: Really good. Really good.
Joe: 真的很好。真的很好。

Merryn: Joe, thank you so much for being with us today. Hugely appreciate it. That was fascinating.
Merryn: 乔，非常感谢你今天和我们在一起。非常感谢。那真是太精彩了。
