### 烹饪制作人的角色与日常

I think if you watch The Bear, it makes sense that there is such a thing as a **culinary producer** (Culinary Producer: a professional responsible for all food-related scenes and production in film and television works, ensuring authenticity and visual effects). But maybe if you didn't watch The Bear, you wouldn't even know it was a job. I actually didn't know it was a job either, which makes three of us. What is it? That's a fair question, as a culinary producer deals with both macro and micro issues of the show.

我想，如果你看了《熊家餐馆》，你就会明白为什么会有一种叫做**烹饪制作人**（Culinary Producer: 负责影视作品中所有与食物相关的场景和制作，确保真实性和视觉效果）的职位。但也许如果你没看过《熊家餐馆》，你甚至不会知道有这份工作。我其实也不知道有这份工作，这样算起来我们有三个人不知道。这是什么呢？这是一个很好的问题，因为烹饪制作人处理着剧集的宏观和微观问题。

So I work very closely with Christopher, who is the creator of The Bear, also my brother. And I, along with the writing team, help inform some of the character development based on my own personal experience. Every day on the show, I'm there working hand-in-hand with my culinary team. We prepare all the food and cook it ourselves; we don't have food stylists. So everything you see on the show, we run it like an actual restaurant.

我与《熊家餐馆》的创作者，也就是我兄弟克里斯托弗密切合作。我与编剧团队一起，根据我自己的个人经验，为一些角色发展提供信息。每天在片场，我都和我的烹饪团队并肩工作。我们自己准备和烹饪所有食物；我们没有美食造型师。所以你在节目中看到的一切，我们都像经营一家真正的餐厅一样运作。

We have a full team, but I'm also there to help work with the film department, set decoration, and props to ensure we are as accurate as possible. I wear a lot of different hats, so wherever they need me, I go. I definitely use the script to inform the direction of the food, and then I'm responsible for working with the cast to bring those things to life. As you see on the show, these actors are actually cooking; we don't use hand doubles. They are truly doing it themselves, even though hand doubles are a common practice in cooking scenes.

我们有一个完整的团队，但我也会与电影部门、布景装饰和道具部门合作，以确保我们尽可能地精确。我身兼数职，所以无论他们需要我到哪里，我就去哪里。我肯定会根据剧本指导食物的制作方向，然后我负责与演员们合作，将这些呈现在屏幕上。正如你在剧中所看到的，这些演员是真的在烹饪；我们不使用替手。他们是亲自操作的，尽管在烹饪场景中使用替手是常见的做法。

### 厨房工作的挑战与真实性

The food itself feels like the main character, even though the actors on the show are incredible. So, how hard is it to do what you do? It's actually challenging, but very fun, especially since I come from the real restaurant world. I'm a chef and have been in the restaurant world here in Los Angeles for many years. I've been in the restaurant world forever.

尽管剧中的演员们表现出色，但食物本身感觉就像是主角。那么，做你这份工作有多难呢？这实际上很有挑战性，但也非常有趣，特别是考虑到我来自真实的餐饮界。我是一名厨师，在洛杉矶的餐饮界工作多年，可以说一直都在这个行业里。

Bringing these things to life requires a wealth of knowledge from all the restaurants I've worked in. Doing it on camera means it not only has to look great but also be time and temperature sensitive, as we shoot very, very fast. So it really is a team effort to decide, "This is the dish," and get everyone in the loop on how and when to shoot it when it's perfect, especially considering things like melting or wilting. It's a precise process.

将这些东西搬上荧幕，需要我从所有曾工作过的餐厅中汲取大量知识。在镜头前呈现，意味着它不仅要看起来很棒，还要对时间和温度敏感，因为我们的拍摄速度非常快。所以，这确实是一个团队合作，来决定“这就是这道菜”，并让每个人都了解如何以及何时在完美状态下拍摄它，特别是要考虑到融化或枯萎之类的问题。这是一个非常精确的过程。

### 演员的烹饪训练与技能提升

You have a background as a chef, in culinary training. Yes, and **Matty Matheson** (Matty Matheson: 著名加拿大厨师、餐饮老板和作家，也出演《熊家餐馆》) is an actual chef. Jeremy Allen White also undertook a couple of weeks of culinary training with me. Yes, Liza Colón-Zayas, and they all spent time with me directly here in Los Angeles, in my kitchen, my catering kitchen, where we trained to work on some specifics for the show that would be done on camera.

你拥有厨师背景和烹饪培训经验。是的，而且**马蒂·马西森**（Matty Matheson: 著名加拿大厨师、餐饮老板和作家，也出演《熊家餐馆》）本身就是一位真正的厨师。杰瑞米·艾伦·怀特也和我一起进行了几周的烹饪训练。是的，丽莎·科隆-萨亚斯也一样，他们都在洛杉矶我的厨房、我的餐饮厨房里，直接和我一起训练，学习一些要在镜头前展示的特定技能。

For example, Tina's character is shown preparing a **Bronzino** (Bronzino: a common Mediterranean sea bass) in culinary school, and she's left-handed. The way we filmed that scene and how she had to practice it meant applying these skills so they would look authentic on camera. This experience, including culinary school, working with chefs, and **staging** (Staging: an industry practice where chefs work unpaid in other restaurants to learn new skills and gain experience) in restaurants, was incredibly helpful for their own journey, allowing them to truly get it right on camera.

例如，蒂娜的角色在烹饪学校里处理**海鲈鱼**（Bronzino: 一种常见的地中海鲈鱼），而且她是左撇子。我们拍摄那个场景的方式以及她必须练习的方式，都意味着要运用这些技能，才能在镜头前看起来真实可信。这种经历，包括烹饪学校的学习、与厨师合作，以及在餐厅**实习**（Staging: 厨师在其他餐厅无偿工作，以学习新技能和经验的行业惯例），对他们自身的成长非常有帮助，让他们能够在镜头前真正做到位。

What were they like at the beginning? I think everyone—well, they all have a passion for food, which certainly helps. Jeremy Allen White, Lionel Boyce, and Liza Colón-Zayas all love food. They were eager to get it right. They've come a long way and I see the effort they put in each season. Remember, we're now going into our fifth season, and we practice before filming each year, so they're continually building their skills.

他们一开始怎么样？我想每个人——嗯，他们都对食物充满热情，这当然很有帮助。杰瑞米·艾伦·怀特、莱昂内尔·博伊斯和丽莎·科隆-萨亚斯都热爱美食。他们渴望把事情做好。他们进步了很多，我看到了他们每一季付出的努力。请记住，我们现在要进入第五季了，我们每年拍摄前都会进行练习，所以他们的技能也在不断提升。

My wife worked in kitchens, and she would watch the show with me and remark on its authenticity—things like the masking tape and labeling, and how we actually drank out of those to-go containers, which we call **delis** (Deli containers: plastic containers commonly used in delis or takeout restaurants). "That's what it's like," she'd say. "I worked at Taco Bell, so I have no idea what's important. It's not like this at all." After watching a few episodes of the first season, I thought, "Who would want to do this?" The pressure is crazy; you're getting paid a fraction. It's like the pressure of being a brain surgeon without any of the pay, and the hours are worse. That's a really good question.

我妻子以前在厨房工作，她会和我一起看剧，并评论剧中的真实性——比如美纹纸胶带和标签的使用，以及我们如何真的用那种外带容器喝水，我们称之为**熟食店容器**（Deli containers: 通常用于熟食店或外卖餐厅的塑料容器）。她会说：“就是那样子的。”“我在塔可钟工作过，所以我不知道什么重要。但它完全不是这样的。”看了第一季的几集后，我心想：“谁会想干这个？”压力太大了；你拿的工资却微乎其微。这就像是脑外科医生的压力，却没有那份薪水，而且工作时间更长。这是一个非常好的问题。

### 厨房生活的磨砺与团队精神

I think what the show does a really good job at is showing some of the difficulties and some of the wonderful things. There is so much camaraderie, chemistry, and teamwork in kitchens that keeps you coming back every day. I learn so much about who I am as an individual through the challenge of running restaurants and line cooking.

我认为这部剧做得非常出色的一点是，它展现了一些困难，也展现了一些美好的事物。厨房里有那么多的友情、默契和团队合作，让你每天都想回来。我通过经营餐厅和在生产线上烹饪的挑战，学到了很多关于我作为一个个体是怎样的人。

Not only do I develop my skills as a chef, but I think, as a person, I've learned so much from every single person I've been in a kitchen with, from the porters to the dishwashers, to the front-of-house host, to the head chef. There is always something to learn in kitchens. It's fine, actually quite fun, though it is stressful. Yes, but there's a reason people come back every day.

我不仅提升了作为厨师的技能，我认为，作为一个人，我从厨房里遇到的每一个人身上都学到了很多，从搬运工到洗碗工，从前厅经理到主厨。在厨房里总能学到东西。这很好，其实相当有趣，尽管压力很大。是的，但人们每天都回来工作是有原因的。

### 拍摄过程中的精益求精

Tell us, does something get burned a lot on the show? Well, when you're working against the clock, timing is crucial. Of course, there's a lot of setting each other up for success. And I have to say, without my culinary team, we very diligently work to make the best use of everyone's time who is working alongside us. There's also a huge, incredible camera department, and we're mindful of them holding heavy cameras and needing to get it right.

告诉我们，剧里是不是经常有东西烧焦？嗯，当你争分夺秒工作时，时机至关重要。当然，我们很多人都在互相帮助，为成功创造条件。我必须说，没有我的烹饪团队，我们非常勤奋地工作，以充分利用与我们并肩工作的每个人的时间。还有一个庞大而优秀的摄影部门，我们很清楚他们举着沉重的摄像机，需要把镜头拍好。

So we practice a lot before we actually shoot. There's a lot of work on the **preproduction** (Preproduction: all planning and preparation work done before the start of film, TV show, etc., production) side before cameras start rolling. It's really important that we bring our **A-game** (A-game: referring to performing at one's highest level in a competition or task) because we don't want things to burn. Of course, we sometimes have to redo dishes if ice cream melts or something similar, but we make sure we're prepared to set everyone up for success first, just like you said, everyone brings their A-game. We treat it like a dinner service.

所以我们在实际拍摄前会进行大量练习。在摄像机开始拍摄之前，**前期制作**（Preproduction: 电影、电视节目等制作开始前所进行的所有规划和准备工作）方面有很多工作。我们带着**最佳状态**（A-game: 指在比赛或工作中发挥出最高水平）来非常重要，因为我们不希望任何东西烧焦。当然，如果冰淇淋融化或类似情况发生，我们有时需要重做菜肴，但我们确保首先做好准备，让每个人都能成功，就像你说的，每个人都拿出自己的最佳状态。我们把它当作一次正餐服务来对待。

You want to change your job? No, I don't think it's in my DNA. I think you'd be surprised, though. Some of my best cooks have never cut anything in their life. Really? So there's hope for everyone. If you've got passion, I can teach you.

你想换工作吗？不，我认为这不是我的天性。不过，你可能会感到惊讶。我手下一些最棒的厨师，在他们的生活中从未拿过刀。真的吗？所以，对每个人来说都有希望。如果你有热情，我就能教你。
