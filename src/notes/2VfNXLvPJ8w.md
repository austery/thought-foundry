### 欢迎与“不可能”同行

挪威银行投资管理公司（Norges Bank Investment Management）的采访者热情欢迎了Vinod Khosla，称他为“最成功的企业家和风险投资家之一”。Khosla于1982年联合创立了**Sun Microsystems**（一家曾是全球领先的计算机硬件和软件公司），并于2004年创立了**Khosla Ventures**（一家专注于技术领域的风险投资公司），该公司在通过技术盈利的同时，也致力于为社会带来积极影响。

<p class="english-text">hi everybody today we are in really good company with one of the most successful entrepreneurs and Venture Capital investors over time, Vinod Khosla. Vinod um co-founded Sun Microsystems back in 1982 and Khosla Ventures in 2004, and Khosla Ventures is uh making money in technology whilst also doing good stuff for society, so uh warm welcome Vinod.</p>
</details>

### 专家意见的局限性与“不可能”的重要性

Khosla被问及他所说的“只有不可能的事情才重要”是什么意思。他解释说，这直接关系到他对专家意见的看法：专家非常擅长预测过去的延伸，而不是对未来提出新的愿景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">great to be here you say that it is only the improbable which is important what do you mean by that most in this goes immediately into my views on expert opinion it's very good at predicting the an extrapolation of the past as opposed to a new kind of vision for the future.</p>
</details>

他指出，预测和预报只有在世界发生变化时才重要，就像天气从今天到明天会变化一样。然而，当俄罗斯入侵乌克兰时，专家们预测两天内就会结束，但事实并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when you look at forecast and predictions only time they're important if the world changes if the weather changes from today to tomorrow but if you look at expert opinion when Russia invaded Ukraine experts were this will be over in two days.</p>
</details>

几乎所有重大的变革都是如此，专家们随后会修正他们的预测以适应过去。Khosla认为，正是企业家们创造了他们想要的未来，并创造了那些看似“不可能”的场景。他引用了美国能源部在2010年对2035年电动汽车数量的预测，但**Elon Musk**和**Tesla**在2016年就超越了这一预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the same is true of almost all large changes uh then the experts revised their forecast to expolit the Past uh it's entrepreneurs specifically who invent the future they want and create unlikely scenarios uh the studies like Ukraine I site are when uh the Department of energy in the United States forecast the number of electric cars in the US in 2010 they made a 25-year later forecast for 2035 and Elon Musk and Tesla exceeded that forecast in 2016.</p>
</details>

他强调，企业家们努力实现他们不同的愿景，这正是推动变革的原因，而这些愿景在某种意义上是“不可能”的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so Ur trying to make a different future their Vision happen is what drives change and they're improbable in that sense.</p>
</details>

### 如何识别专家完全错误的“不可能”情境

Khosla认为，精确识别这些情境非常困难。他举例说，**Khosla Ventures**在2018年决定投资**OpenAI**时，很难预测AI何时会取得突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you identify these situations where experts are totally wrong I think it's very hard to identify precisely these situations when we invested in open AI in 2018 is when we made the commitment to invest it was hard to say when they would be a breakthrough in AI.</p>
</details>

然而，可预测的是趋势线呈指数级增长，当时他们正处于指数曲线的平坦部分，即早期变化阶段。随后，突破发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what was predictable was the trend line was an exponential it was very likely we were in the F flat part of the curve of an exponential the early changes uh and then the Breakthrough happened.</p>
</details>

2017年的一篇论文对AI的进步至关重要，因此AI能力突然腾飞。Khosla称之为“不可能”，因为当时没有人预测到这一点，但**Sam Altman**和他的**OpenAI**团队使其成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so there was a particular paper in 2017 that turned out to be quite important for AI progress and because of that suddenly AI capability took off uh I would call that improbable because nobody else was predicting it but it took Sam Alman and his team at openi to make that a reality.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，这篇论文并非由**OpenAI**撰写，而是由**Google**研究人员撰写。但**OpenAI**相信它，并将其规模化，使其成为现实，就像**Elon Musk**相信电动汽车并创造了**Tesla**一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in fact the paper wasn't written by Google by open AI it was written by Google researchers and then it became important and they scaled it they believed in it they scaled it they made it happen just like Elon Musk believed in electric cars and made Tesla happen.</p>
</details>

重大的变革几乎总是以这种方式驱动的。例如，目前没有一家传统汽车制造商在开发最先进的自动驾驶汽车，而是**Google**，一家与汽车行业看似无关的公司。这就是Khosla所说的“不可能”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and so Lord changes are almost always driven that way there's not a single Automotive player who's developing really state-ofthe-art self-driving cars it's not the Volkswagens of the world it's Google which has no business being in automotive and that's what I mean by improbable.</p>
</details>

当**Amazon**刚起步时，Khosla是其早期投资者，当时也没有人认为他们能与**Walmart**竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when Amazon started you were early investor in Amazon it was the same nobody thought they took take on Walmart.</p>
</details>

### 识别颠覆性机遇的关键因素

Khosla解释说，识别这些机遇涉及多个因素。首先，机遇本身必须是正确的。大多数人，尤其是任何领域的专家，在面对根本性变革时，往往会告诉你为什么它“不可能”实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you find these situations do you is that people coming to you is it people you know is it things you read how do you get across them well more than there's multiple factors first the opportunity has to be right so you have to uh you know most people especially most experts in in any area when you look at radical change they tell you why it can't be done.</p>
</details>

然而，有一类企业家会问“为什么不呢？”如果存在一条可行的路径，并且企业家愿意通过坚持不懈使其实现，这就是他们所寻找的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's a breed of people that are entrepren that say why not if there's a plausible path for why it could be done and ENT is ready to make it happen through persistence um I think uh that's what you look for it's the right personality in the right environment the timing is right for a lar change.</p>
</details>

这意味着在正确的时机，在正确的环境中，拥有正确个性的人。此外，变革的理由必须合乎逻辑，并且有技术突破作为支撑。例如，当移动电话出现时，**Uber**和**Airbnb**才成为可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um the rationale makes sense there's a technology breakthrough when mobile f phones came for example Uber was possible um or Airbnb was possible in and then they make that happen.</p>
</details>

他以**Steve Jobs**的手机愿景为例，这个愿景最初受到很多批评，因为人们无法想象没有拨号按键的手机。当时**Nokia**和**Motorola**是两大手机巨头，但他们没有设想这样的未来。**Steve Jobs**的愿景是关于一个主要不用于通话的设备，这在当时是难以置信的。这也是一个非常重大的“不可能”事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so take take the examples of cell phones Steve Jobs had a vision which is very much criticized because people said a phone without a button without buttons for dialing you're old enough to remember when Nokia and others Motorola were the two big cell phone players but they didn't imagine this future uh Steve had a different vision and um was really about a device that would not mostly be used for talking but it was a phone it was an adity that was hard to believe so that's another very large improbable.</p>
</details>

### 最佳投资与创新者的特质

Khosla被问及他最好的投资。他提到，投资是团队合作的结果，并强调了另一个“不可能”的例子，这对于理解指数级增长的本质非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what have been your best investments I mean you've been invested in quite a few of the names you mentioned here already but what kind of stand out well first we invest as a team but uh mention another improvable because I think it's very important in the nature of these exponentials.</p>
</details>

1996年，他们投资了一家名为**Juniper**的公司，该公司预测**TCP/IP**（Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol: 互联网上最基本的通信协议，定义了数据如何在网络中传输）将成为互联网的协议。当时，没有一家电信公司（如**AT&T**、**Verizon**）预测到这一点，它们都有自己的技术原因选择其他协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in 1996 we invested in a company called Juniper that said tcpip would be the protocol for the internet there was not a single Telco player AT&T Verizon they had different names them before their mergers and all that that predicted tcpip would be the protocol for the internet and they had other more technical reasons for going with other protocols.</p>
</details>

他们只是押注了**TCP/IP**，结果在五年内获得了2500倍的投资回报。当时他在**Kleiner Perkins**（一家著名的风险投资公司），他们用300万美元的投资赚了70亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh we just bet on that uh we got a 2500x investment over about five years I was at kleinet Perkins then we made $7 billion on a $3 million investment uh uh that was very nice.</p>
</details>

成功的原因是他们进入了一个既重要（**TCP/IP**被证明是重要的通信协议）又潜力巨大，且没有人押注的领域。像**Nokia**、**Alcatel-Lucent**等大公司都押注了其他协议，而他们作为一家初创公司押注了**TCP/IP**并取得了胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it was because we stepped into an area which was both important tcpip turned out to be important as a protocol for communications um and it was very large U and nobody else was betting on it so Nokia L Alcatel Lucent for all the big names that bet on other protocols and we bet as a startup on this and we won I was at K Perkins at that point.</p>
</details>

他们还在**Google**还是几个“古怪的博士生”时就投资了它。尽管他们当时不知道**Google**会有多大的影响，但这些学生有真正的决心，他们的想法也很有意义。当时，很难想象1996年两个谈论“组织世界信息”的孩子，会改变世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we also invested in Google when was a couple of flaky PhD students uh in but they had real resolve in the ideas made sense and you didn't know how large it would be how important the improvable would be when they were talking about organizing the world's information it was hard to extrapolate 1996 from two kids talking about that to it will change the world in many many ways so those are all improbables.</p>
</details>

这些都是“不可能”的例子，其共同特征是：拥有决心、毅力、低概率高影响力的赌注，以及适合他们立足并发展的环境。这些是他们作为投资者所寻找的特质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">characteristics of people with the resolve and determination with persistence with low probability high impact bets and the environment being right for them to find a tow hold and then explain from there those are characteristics we look for from an investment point of view.</p>
</details>

### 筛选创新者：快速学习与第一性原理

当一个“古怪的博士生”带着改变世界的计划来到办公室时，Khosla会如何筛选？他说，他们会评估这个人有多么坚韧不拔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so now I'm I'm a flaky PhD student uh I come into your office what kind of things do you ask me I say hey I got a super plan I'm going to change the world we see that all the time and we have to judge how persistent will they be.</p>
</details>

通过与他们交流一两个月，通常可以判断他们学习和适应不确定情境的速度。快速学习比经验更重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you're talking to them about the investment for a month or two you can usually tell how fast they will learn how F fast they will change and adapt in uncertain scenarios fast learning is more important than experience uh and we can come back to that.</p>
</details>

事实上，经验在这些环境中很少有帮助，经验往往是一系列偏见，导致人们推断过去，而不是追求一个截然不同的未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">experience seldom helps in these environments in fact experience is a set of biases which causes you to extrapolate the past and not go after a radically different future.</p>
</details>

如何筛选出快速学习者？可以通过观察他们如何回答问题，以及在受到挑战时如何回应。他们是否从**第一性原理**（First Principles Thinking: 一种思考方式，通过将问题分解到最基本的真理，而不是基于类比或假设来解决问题）出发，审视自己的假设？还是被动地回应“我知道这是真的”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you screen for false learning how how can you figure out whether I'm a f learning you can watch somebody and see how well they answer questions uh if you challenge them how they respond are they thinking from first principles uh and saying let me examine this assumption or are they being reactive I know this to be true which is very common in experiened business people.</p>
</details>

“我们一直都是这样做的”、“这总是有效的”、“我已经做了30年了”——这些对于创业者来说都是不好的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we've always done it this way we've uh had the world this is always worked I've done this for 30 years those are all bad signs for an entrepreneurial person.</p>
</details>

Khosla承认，如何避免自己陷入这种陷阱是他所做的最困难的事情之一。他认为，最困难的是如何保持与新思维和新领域的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you've done it for 30 years and more so how do you make sure that you that you don't fall into that trap and that's one of the hardest things I do I I I think the hardest thing I do is decide how I stay relevant to Fresh thinking and fresh areas.</p>
</details>

他再次以投资**Juniper**为例，当时很难说他们能赢，但有一个理想化的愿景，说明为什么它会比其他专家所说的更优越。通过从**第一性原理**审视它，问“为什么它不会发生？”当人们给出**ABC**等理由时，如果能够挑战这些理由，那么它就可能发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know when I invested in Juniper which was the at protocol for the internet it was very hard to say we could win but there was an idealized vision of why it would be superior to what others much more experts expert opinion was saying would be would happen and examining it from first principles like why won't it happen and people will tell you because ABC and then you say if I can challenge ABC then in fight in fact Happ happen.</p>
</details>

因此，**第一性原理**思维和快速改变想法的意愿至关重要。伟大的创新者总是能从实践中快速学习。Khosla认为，重大的变革并非总是可计划的，但它们可以通过一系列迭代步骤和智慧的思考来“发现”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's this first principles thinking and then being willing to change people's your mind mind rapidly that great Aros always learn rapidly from being in the field I always say LGE changes are not always planable but they are discoverable and series of iterative steps by smart thinking.</p>
</details>

### 科技驱动的未来：12大趋势

Khosla在一次**Ted Talk**中分享了对未来的12个趋势预测。他指出，这些趋势的共同点是它们都由技术驱动。技术引发了变革，然后寻找能够推动这种变革发生的企业家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's um utilize some of your smart thinking now and let's try to predict the future which you have done in a in a fantastic Ted talk so you have identify 12 trends for the future and I'd love to dive into each one of them if you don't mind but just uh before that just what these Trends what do they have in what do they have in common what are they about my particular area of expertise and I hate to even call it expertise it's more specul smart speculation or I call them intelligent gats of what might be possible uh is technology driven so technology causes the change which causes a change of in um and then you sort of say with that is there an entrepreneur who can drive that change to happen.</p>
</details>

他再次以**Elon Musk**使电动汽车成为可能为例，而**General Motors**等传统巨头在**Musk**之前也曾投入巨资尝试，但未能成功。这些变革是技术驱动的，并改变了我们对事物的假设，使得过去的推断变得无效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">somebody like Nan musk make electric cars possible when General Motors couldn't and they attempted that and spent quite a lot of money before Elan must did on electric cars it's technology driven change and a change in assumptions which make the exporation of the past somewhat invalid if if you could make the New Vision happen.</p>
</details>

当然，世界其他地方通常不相信这种快速变化。没有人相信**Airbnb**，认为人们会允许陌生人进入他们的家；也没有人相信**Uber**会成为一个大生意；或者在互联网上建立零售业，不需要像**Walmart**这样的大型零售店。这些在发生之前都是激进的假设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of course the rest of the world generally doesn't believe this rapid change nobody believes in Airbnb as people would let strangers into their house or that Uber would be a large business or that you could build retailing on the internet e-commerce and not have retail stores like major retailers like Walmart these are all radical assumptions before they happen and that people would be happy to buy.</p>
</details>

#### 预测一：专业知识将免费

Khosla的第一个激进预测是：专业知识将免费。**AI**发展如此迅速，我们很快就会达到**AI**在大多数领域与普通人一样好的地步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's dive into some of these radical predictions you have first one expertise will be free AI is moving so rapidly we are very close to the point where AI is as good as the median person in most areas.</p>
</details>

无论是肿瘤学家、初级保健医生、教师、结构工程师还是矿产资源勘探工程师，**AI**都将变得足够好，能够极大地提升现有专业人士的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so whether you're looking at an oncologist a primary care doctor a teacher a structural engineer a minerals engineer doing minerals resource Discovery AI is getting good enough to be huge leverage on today's people with expertise in that area.</p>
</details>

他认为，很快在所有这些领域，更准确地说，在大多数专业领域，**AI**将超越人类。由于**AI**只是计算，它可以无限复制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think very very soon in all these areas and all areas of expertise more accurately I should say in most areas of expertise AI will be better than the human and then because it's computation only it can be replicated infinitely.</p>
</details>

例如，美国有数百万医生，但如果能拥有10倍的专业知识，那将几乎是免费的。我们可以以极低的成本提供更多的初级保健服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's a million doctors in the US couple of hundred thousand Primary Care doctors and then specialists in various areas but if you could have 10 times the amount of expertise it would be near free uh and we could provide a lot more Primary Care without much cost or maybe even substantially lower cost.</p>
</details>

免费的专业知识将带来什么影响？Khosla认为世界将变得非常**通货紧缩**（Deflationary: 指物价普遍持续下降的经济现象），但这是“好”的通货紧缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a good example what are the implications of uh free expertise what will it do to the world I'm starting to think through the implications I think that world will be quite deflationary but deflationary in a good way.</p>
</details>

当然，也会有一些负面影响，比如工作岗位可能被取代，无论是销售人员被**AI**销售人员取代，还是结构工程师被**AI**取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there will be some bad side effects that job may be replaced whether it's a sales person being replaced by a AI sales person which is being developed AI replaced by a structural engineer or uh or structural engineer replaced by an AI.</p>
</details>

如果美国每年在医生工资上花费的3000亿或4000亿美元中，90%可以节省下来，那必然会带来通货紧缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know if you take the 300 billion or 400 billion we spend on physician salaries in the US and say 90% of it will go away uh that has to be deflationary.</p>
</details>

这是否会使世界更公平、更平等？Khosla坚信是的。他认为我们有机会，并且正在努力使世界更公平、更普及。他一直主张像印度这样的国家应该提供免费的**AI**初级保健服务，就像他们提供免费支付服务一样，没有**Visa**和**MasterCard**对所有交易征税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">will it make the world a fairer and more equal place you think I'm absolutely certain uh we have an opportunity and I use the word opportunity carefully to make the world fairer more accessible I do believe and I've been arguing that a country like India should offer free Primary Care AI uh just like they offer free payments there's no visa and MasterCard in India with their tax on all transactions uh that is possible.</p>
</details>

同样，每个孩子都可以拥有免费的**AI**导师。Khosla的妻子运营的一个非营利组织就有一个**AI**系统，可以比人类更快、更准确地评估学生的优缺点，然后针对性地进行教学。这种教育精度将几乎免费提供，实际上**ck12**网站已经免费提供，他们希望在全球推广。这只涉及到计算成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and free teachers for free AI tutors for every child um we have ai in fact my wife runs a nonprofit that has an AI um that can assess a student in their weak strengths and weaknesses faster than a human can and more accurately and then teach to their weakness that level of Education Precision will come for almost free in fact that's offered for free on the ck12 website um today um and we want to scale it globally uh and it only cost the cost of computing.</p>
</details>

#### 预测二：劳动力将免费

Khosla认为劳动力也将免费。他预测，在未来五年内，我们几乎肯定会开发出**双足机器人**（Bipedal Robots: 能够用两条腿行走，模仿人类移动方式的机器人），它们拥有两条腿和两条手臂，能够完成人类可以完成的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you also say that you think labor will be free I do think uh and this is a little harder to project today but uh almost certainly over the next five years we will develop bipi robots that means robots that have two legs and two arms that can do the kind of work humans can.</p>
</details>

制造这种机器人的硬件相对容易。他相信这个行业在25年内将比整个汽车行业还要大，但目前没有人为此做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh the the hardware for that is quite easy and by the way I believe that industry will be larger than all of the Auto industry in 25 years and nobody's planning for that large a change um but nobody's planning for expertise being free uh a free PhD in every area you want but it's cell biology or Material Science.</p>
</details>

如果真的能实现，他认为在未来五年内，甚至可能更早，这些机器人将作为工厂工人出现，拥有人类的敏捷性、手指（用于组装工作）、力量和外形，能够适应现有环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if we get to that which I think very very likely we will in the next five years possibly sooner uh and many people including Elon Musk are promising it sooner as Factory workers that are robots um that are that have the agility of humans the human fingers for assembly work F work uh human strength human form factor fit into the current environments because they designed to be be the form factor of humans.</p>
</details>

这些机器人将几乎免费且可无限复制。如果能有十亿个这样的机器人，它们可以做比今天所有人类劳动力更多的工作，因为它们可以24小时工作，无论是农场工人、装配线工人还是家务劳动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that can be near free and infinitely replicable if you had a billion such robots and we do have a lot of cars so I always compare it to the Auto industry because it's a physical thing uh they could do more work because they can work 24-hour shifts um then all the human labor today whether it's Farm Workers whether it's assembly line workers or other tasks household tasks for example.</p>
</details>

#### 预测三：计算能力将免费/极低廉

Khosla认为计算能力的增长是自然趋势，并将持续下去。计算作为每单位成本正在迅速下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what about uh the growth of Compu in power which you also talk about I think that's growing naturally I think it will continue growing I think we are already on that trend line and so Computing as a cost per unit of computing is declining very very rapidly.</p>
</details>

过去非常昂贵的是编程这些计算机，而且大多数人不会编程。但他认为，我们将进入一个可以用语音和自然语言编程计算机的世界，无论是印地语、英语还是日语，都无所谓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what has been very expensive is programming these computers and most people can't program a computer I do think we will get to a world where you can program it with voice in natural language whether you're speaking Hindi or English or Japanese doesn't matter you program these computers in human language and you can use them much more effectively.</p>
</details>

这将极大地扩展计算机的使用范围，因为这本质上是一个**AI**计算机程序员。这将使那些迅速变得廉价的硅芯片硬件更容易被使用，几乎是透明的。就像今天我们不考虑电力一样，Khosla认为计算将成为像电力一样的后台活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the range of uses could expand dramatically because what I'm talking about is essentially an AI computer programmer and that makes all the hardware that's getting very cheap very quickly in Silicon chips make much more accessible and You' use it almost transparently you know today we don't think of electricity I think Computing will be like a background activity like electricity.</p>
</details>

当计算像电力和水一样免费或极其廉价时，它会改变什么？显而易见的微小变化包括家庭建筑效率，例如知道房间里有人时自动关灯、调节温度，了解你的日程安排等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when Computing is free or you know extremely cheap as electricity and water is now what what will it change for example you know the obvious small things are like B building efficiency in your home watching you knowing who's in the room turning off the lights turning down the things knowing your calendar knowing when to turn the heat up or the heat down all those kind of things but those are my minor.</p>
</details>

但他认为这些都是次要的。你将能够编程几乎任何任务。地球上有70亿人，每个人可以拥有10个**代理**（Agents: 在人工智能中，指能够感知环境、进行决策并采取行动以实现特定目标的智能实体）。想象一下700亿个**代理**在互联网上运行，为计算机执行任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you will be able to program almost any task there's s billion humans each could have 10 agents so imagine 70 billion agents running around the internet doing tasks for computers.</p>
</details>

今天你需要打电话叫**Uber**，将来你可能只需简单地说：“我10点有个会议，让我准时到达。”这意味着**代理**首先要知道会议地点，查看你的日历，确定去旧金山某个特定地址，检查交通，计算所需时间，确定何时出发，并叫**Uber**确保准时到达。所有这些任务都可以由**代理**为你完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">today you have to go call an Uber you might say something as simple as I have a meeting at 10:00 there get me there on time and that means first knowing where that is looking up my calend saying I have to get to San Francisco to to to this particular address checking traffic how long will it take determining when I should leave calling me in Uber to make sure it shows up on time uh all those are tasks that an agent could do for me.</p>
</details>

或者，它可以像“我想要一个个性化的锻炼计划，为我设计一个”这样简单。谁将拥有这些**代理**？Khosla认为将是独立的私人公司。他提到昨天看到一家公司，正在为人们设计个性化的健身计划。他们最初由物理教练设计，每位教练可以支持10到20个客户。现在，每位教练可以支持150人，因为**AI**在物理教练的监督下完成了大部分训练计划的设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um or it could be be as simple as uh I want a personalized exercise program design one for me who would own this agent I think it's independent companies I saw a company yesterday that's designing physical programs for people individually they started by having physical trainers who are experts in their area design individual programs and you could support 10 or 20 consumers per trainer doing an hour of training a week or something now they're up to 150 people per trainer why because AI starts to do much of the training program design under the supervision of the physical trainer.</p>
</details>

在未来十年，我们将看到很多这样的情况。想象一个作为高级程序员实习生的软件程序，或者一个作为专家**AI**医生实习生的**AI**医生。因此，在未来五到十年，我们将看到**AI**在人类监督下逐步发布。然后，这些**AI**将变得足够好，更重要的是，人类对它们的能力更有信心，我们将允许它们做越来越多的事情。这将是一个在人类监督下逐步引入的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and for the next decade we will see a lot of this imagine a software program that's an intern to a senior programmer imagine a physician AI intern that's a pH intern to a to an expert AI doctor and so we will see this supervised release of AI for the next decade maybe five years and then these start to be good enough and more importantly us humans have more confidence in their capability and we let them do more and more so I think it'll be a gradual introduction of these under human supervision.</p>
</details>

Khosla还提到，这些能力将是可实现的，但有些社会会反对它们。就像纺织机引入时人们反对一样，大多数新技术都曾遭到反对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also mentioned one other thing I use the word probable um are capable we will have these capabilities but some societies will oppose them when the Looms for textile U making textiles was were introduced people oppos them um most new technology has been opposed.</p>
</details>

既得利益者，那些短期内会受到伤害（比如工作被机器人取代）的人，是否会允许这些发生，将是决定变革速度（五年、十年还是二十五年）的关键因素。一些社会将更快地引入这些技术，从而更快地取得经济进步。而另一些社会将专注于“保住工作”，Khosla认为这将是一场失败的战斗，这些国家将因为更高的成本结构而输掉经济竞赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and whether the incumbents who get short-term harm like a job replaced by a robot let that happen or not uh is going to be a major determinant of the pace whether this takes five years 10 years or 25 years to happen some societies will introduce them faster than others and they will make economic progress faster than others others will focus on we have to preserve jobs which I think will be a losing battle and countries that do that will lose uh the economic race uh because our higher cost structure.</p>
</details>

他认为政策将是引入速度的最大决定因素，政府、民主进程和长期愿景都将发挥作用。Khosla甚至担心中国可能会采取一种非常不同的“天安门广场式”方法来引入这些技术，而其他国家可能会有更民主的进程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it'll be an important issue how Society introduces I think policy will be the single biggest determinant of the rate of introduction of these so governments will matter democ atic process will matter long-term views will matter I in fact worry China may have a very different tanaman Square type approach to introducing these Technologies um and other countries may have much more of a democratic process.</p>
</details>

他举例说，最近好莱坞的**美国演员工会**（Screen Actors Guild）反对使用**AI**生成内容。这正是一个例子，他们没有选择利用**AI**作为创意工具来扩展能力，而是选择反对，因为这关系到短期工作。Khosla对那些受到颠覆影响的人表示同情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where we recently saw the Screen Actors Guild in Hollywood oppose the use of AI generated content that's a good example in instead of saying we will leverage that content we'll be the we'll use it as a creative tool to expand what we can do and expand infinitely entertainment available to people uh they chose to oppose it because it was short-term jobs it's a real concern I I'm pretty empathetic to the people who are disrupted whenever you're trying to disrupt the world.</p>
</details>

#### 预测四：AI将在娱乐和设计中扮演更大角色

Khosla认为**AI**几乎肯定会在娱乐和设计中扮演更大的角色。他提到一位艺术家在**Twitter**上说，他用**AI**来完成他的音乐，因为他有90%的音乐未完成。现在**AI**可以帮助他完成并发布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you say that you think AI will will play a larger role in entertainment and design almost certainly I saw a tweet yesterday two days ago by an artist who said oh I just use AI to finish my music I have so much unfinished music 90% of my music is music I didn't finish now ai can help me finish it and release it.</p>
</details>

音乐可以变得互动。他以视频游戏为例，20年前它们只是好莱坞和传统电影、音乐的一小部分，现在已经比音乐产业大得多，因为它们更具互动性，而人类喜欢互动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">music for example can become interactive you know take a simple entertainment area like video games they've grown a lot they were tiny fraction 20 years ago compared to Hollywood or film and traditional video um and audio music uh they've become much larger than music as an industry why because it's much more interactive and humans like interactive.</p>
</details>

音乐能否变得互动，让每个人根据自己的喜好混合自己的音乐？Khosla认为绝对可以。我们可以回顾过去并抵制变革，或者扩展可能性。事实上，今天的音乐制作方式与90年代早期没有数字音乐、没有音轨、没有可混合音乐时大不相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">could music become interactive where every person mixes their own music to their preference absolutely so we can be Lites about it and look retrospectively and resist change or expand the repor in fact most music today is produced very differently than it was in the early 90s when we didn't have digital music we didn't have stems we didn't have music to mix uh you know what's happened in music is the same that's happened in software open source contributions that people can mix and match and create new music out of or even build their own Library so every song isn't a fresh song.</p>
</details>

他认为这将是更好的音乐，更多样化的音乐，迎合更广泛的用户，并服务于特定目的。例如，如果一个人准备参加奥运会，他想要充满活力的音乐；如果只是在周日早上放松冥想，他会想要不同的音乐。我们将拥有个性化的音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it'll be better music it'll be more diverse music cater to a larger range range of users and for particular purpose you know if I'm getting ready to compete in the Olympics and I want to get all energized it'll be different music I want than if on a Sunday morning I just want to relax and meditate I'll have personal music.</p>
</details>

他甚至提到，音乐将能够读取大脑信号，判断何种音乐能让人平静下来。他自己每晚睡前都会使用一个设备，测量大脑活动，然后根据基线刺激大脑10分钟，以产生更好的睡眠所需的**theta波**（Theta Waves: 一种慢波脑电波，通常与放松、冥想和睡眠有关）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and in fact it'll be able to read my brain signals and say uh what what kind of music would calm me down uh I use this every night last night before going to bed I use a device that actually measures my brain activity and says based on this Baseline I'm going to stimulate your brain for 10 minutes it's it's like brushing your teeth I brush my brain too and it stimulates my brain for the theta waves the low frequency waves that result in better sleep and so when I brush my brain this way with electrical measurement and stimulation and for 10 minutes before I go to bed I sleep better.</p>
</details>

因此，音乐也可以做到这一点，我们将为每个人生成个性化的音乐。同时，我们仍然会有像**Taylor Swift**这样的明星，以及更多样化的古典音乐选择，人们将有更多的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so music can do the same we'll have personalized music generated for each person and we will still have Kayla Swift and the celebrities of the world then we'll still have even more diverse range of what is classical music people will have a lot more Choice.</p>
</details>

#### 预测五：个性化定制医疗

Khosla认为医疗科学也在发生变化，我们已经在进行个性化定制。癌症是一个世界性的健康问题，但有效的解决方案很少，我们只能稍微延迟死亡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what about the tailor making of medicine you talk about the signs of medicine changing as well we are already doing it you know cancer is a large uh problem in the world of course in human health um with very few really effect Ive Solutions we can delay death a little bit.</p>
</details>

但如果能为每个人的癌症量身定制蛋白质来干扰它，而不是批准一种适用于全球70亿人的药物（这是目前药物批准的方式），那将是巨大的进步。因为每个癌症都不同，每个人的疾病和基因也不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if you could tailor design a protein to interfere with that cancer one person's cancer not a drug approved for all seven billion people on the planet which is how we approve drugs and each cancer is different each person's disease and genetics are different uh we will be able to custom design it.</p>
</details>

他提到一家名为**N1 Bio**的公司，其理念是针对药物的目标人群规模为“一个人”（N=1）。这已经开始发生。他预计药物研发需要更长时间，所以可能需要10到15年才能成为主流范式。但**AI**绝对能让我们可预测地为每个人的癌症设计药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in fact we have a come uh company called N1 bio the idea is the population side for the Target drugs is one person N1 n equal to one so it's starting to happen I think drugs take longer so I expect it'll be 10 15 years before that becomes more of a paradigm but absolutely AI will let us design drugs predictably for one person's cancer.</p>
</details>

#### 预测六：食物生产将更清洁

**AI**对食物的影响是什么？我们吃的食物不会改变，但我们能否用更少的化学品生产它们？Khosla认为绝对可以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what about food what will you do to food the food we eat will be the food we eat but can we produce it with a lot less chemicals for example absolutely.</p>
</details>

因为机器人可以从树上摘虫子，而不是用杀虫剂或除草剂轰炸它们。他们已经在温室里用机器人种植草莓和其他作物，机器人可以精确控制每株植物的温度和肥料，生产出更甜的草莓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because uh robots can pick bugs off trees instead of bombarding them with pesticides or herbicides um so we are already doing it we are doing strawberries and other things in green houses completely done with robots uh that can control it and precisely control temperature fertilizer for each plant produce much sweeter strawberries.</p>
</details>

有一种特殊的韩国草莓，因为需要精细护理而价格昂贵，几乎从不种植，但他们现在正在常规生产。Khosla认为**AI**对农业的影响会小一些，但他举了一些例子。他们有一家公司，**John Deere**（一家大型农业机械制造商）曾驾驶机器穿过田地，通过摄像头读取每株植物的图像，识别出杂草后，对每株杂草进行定制喷洒除草剂，而不是喷洒整个田地。杀虫剂也同样适用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh so there's a particular class of Korean strawberries that are almost never grown because they're too expensive to grow because they need detail care we are routinely producing them I do think AI will have less an impact on agriculture but I've just given you some examples we had a company that John Deere B that drove through fields and custom sprayed herbicide on each weed after reading each plant with an IM as through a camera saying this identifying it as the weed and killing it one weed at a time instead of spraying the field with P herbicides and the same applies to pesticides.</p>
</details>

当然，也可以对每株植物单独施肥，因为它们的需求可能不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a good example of how you change agriculture of course you can fertilize individually also each plant because their needs may be different.</p>
</details>

#### 预测七：城市将实现个性化公共交通

Khosla认为汽车是人类的伟大发明，但大多数城市过于拥堵。目前全球4000个需要公共交通的城市中，只有约200个拥有公共交通。原因在于公共交通的资本支出非常高，对用户不便，使用率越低，为了经济效益，班次就越少，导致人们更不愿意使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">will we have a cars in our cities I believe cars were a great addition to humanity most cities are too congested and today only about 200 of the 4,000 cities on the planet that should have public transit have public transit why because it's very expensive on capex very inconvenient for the user and the less the usage the less frequent the schedule to make the economics work and then people don't want to use it.</p>
</details>

他相信**自动驾驶**将引入两人座的公共交通工具，即点对点的个性化公共交通。它不会因为其他人下车而停车，因为你不需要共享车辆，并且避免了司机的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do believe self-driving will introduce two person public transit Vehicles sort of personalized public transit going point to point so it never stops where other people have to get off because you're not sharing the vehicle and you avoided the cost of the driver.</p>
</details>

传统的交通方式从面包车到巴士，再到双层巴士、轻轨、重轨，都是因为有司机驾驶，需要聚合更多的人，导致沿途停靠更多，交通时间更慢，班次不便。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we go from a van to a bus to a double decker bus to light rail to heavy rail because there's a person driving the vehicle and so we go to larger and larger aggregation which results in more stops along the way because there's more people on our train and slower Transit time less convenient schedules.</p>
</details>

他们正在加利福尼亚州的四个不同城市设计一个系统，作为一家初创公司赢得了建造公共交通的合同。其理念是点对点，像**Uber**一样，沿途不停靠，甚至不停车等红灯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we are designing a system now in state California in fact in four different cities we have won contracts to build public transit as a startup where the idea is it will be point to point like an Uber and it won't stop anywhere along the way not even traffic lights.</p>
</details>

这将比有司机的汽车更快，因为它不会堵车，也不会停红灯。如果你凌晨1点下班，它会像私人车辆一样准时到达，把你送到目的地，中间不停靠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it will be faster than a chauffeur driven car because it won't be in congestion it won't stop at stop lights it'll go point to point if you get off your restaurant job at 1:00 a.m. it it will be there for you far as a personal vehicle to take you to the stop where you want to go without stopping anywhere else.</p>
</details>

Khosla对此非常兴奋，他认为一旦证明可行，在未来五年内，将有足够的系统实施，每个城市都会采纳这种理念，城市中的汽车数量将减少。他打赌到2050年左右，大多数城市中超过50%的汽车将被淘汰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I'm very excited about this I think at some point once we prove this out and I think we'll in the next five years we will have enough systems implemented that every city will go to this kind of an idea and cars in cities will decline of course there'll be cars but my bet is most cars greater than 50% in most cities will be eliminated by 2050 or so.</p>
</details>

#### 预测八：飞行速度将大幅提升

Khosla认为我们将飞得更快。在**协和飞机**（Concorde: 一种超音速客机，曾用于跨大西洋商业飞行，后因事故和经济原因退役）之后，我们放弃了更快的飞行，音速成为了大多数飞机的限制，除了军用特种飞机和高超音速导弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to say I have very good throughput with my electric scooter which I Ed to to work every day but hey but on AG but what about what about fly agregate if everybody was using the scooter the througho per hour or the streets you drive would be lower than if you had a public transit system doing self-driving uh little pods if you might imagine that yeah yeah now I can see that what about flying you think we'll fly a lot faster yeah you know after the Concord we gave up flying faster and this speed of sound was the limit for most aircraft fly other than specialty aircraft for the military and Hypersonic missiles and things like that.</p>
</details>

他相信我们将实现超音速飞行，尽管这可能与**AI**关系不大，但**AI**将在材料科学和材料设计方面提供帮助。他认为这可以通过非常传统的工程技术实现，只是没有人接受这个挑战，说我们可以以5马赫（每小时4000英里或6000公里）的速度飞行。这将是令人兴奋的，它将使世界变得更小，你可以从伦敦去纽约吃午饭再回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we will get there and I think we're working on that U that probably doesn't have a lot to do with AI but AI will help in Material Science design of materials I think it can be done with very traditional engineering today and it just nobody has taken on that challenge to say we can fly at Mark 5 4,000 mil hour or 6,000 kilometers per hour uh that's that'd be exciting it make the world a shorter place you could go from London to New York for lunch and back.</p>
</details>

#### 预测九：清洁能源将普及

Khosla也是**核聚变**（Nuclear Fusion: 两个或多个原子核结合形成一个更重的原子核，同时释放巨大能量的过程，被视为未来清洁能源的潜力来源）的坚定支持者。他认为**核聚变**之所以未能成功，是因为没有人真正投入工作。**ITER**项目（国际热核聚变实验堆）最初预计需要20年，涉及多个国家协调，是一个庞大的官僚机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">clean power you are also a strong believer in nuclear fusion um how do you see this Well Fusion hasn't worked because no Ono has worked we've had the itar project and started with the assumption it would take 20 years and 25 years coordinated between a lot of Nations a huge bureaucracy.</p>
</details>

然而，自2018年以来，情况发生了变化。2018年，他们决定投资**OpenAI**，同时也决定投资**Commonwealth Fusion**（一家致力于核聚变能源的初创公司），这使得**核聚变**成为现实。现在有十几家可信的**核聚变**初创公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what has happened since 2018 and it is interesting in 2018 we decide to invest in open ey and we also decide to invest in Commonwealth fusion and it made Fusion real now there's a dozen startups that are credible startups in Fusion so I'm very optimistic.</p>
</details>

Khosla非常乐观，认为在未来五年内，没有人会怀疑**核聚变**是一种可行的技术，然后我们将在30年代和40年代将其规模化，规模化会快得多。他希望**核聚变**能用于现有发电厂，用**核聚变**锅炉取代燃煤和天然气锅炉。这可能还需要更换涡轮机，但可以改造旧电厂，用**核聚变**提供清洁、更便宜、更可扩展的电力，因为它不需要更多的煤炭或天然气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in the next 5 years no will doubt that Fusion is a viable technology and then we'll have the 30s and 40s to scale it up and scaling up is much faster My Hope for Fusion is we use current power plants but replace coal boilers and natural gas boilers with Fusion boilers we may need to replace the turbine too but retrofit old plants with Fusion clean power much cheaper much cleaner and of course much more scalable because you're not needing more coal or more natural gas has very little input.</p>
</details>

那么能源也会免费吗？Khosla希望如此。他指出，在印度，如果你有一个大型太阳能设施，你可以以每千瓦时1.7美分的价格获得电力合同，这已经非常接近免费了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so then energy will be free too basically you're free I hope well energy is interesting already if you have a large solar facility in India you can get a contract for $1.7 per kilowatt cents per kilowatt hour of electricity per unit of electricity that's pretty close frame um you know in many parts of the world they're paying 10 times that today.</p>
</details>

当然，太阳能不可靠，不可调度。我们需要在需要时观看比赛，而不是在阳光普照或风吹时。所以我们需要稳定能源。Khosla非常乐观，认为**核聚变**将解决这个问题。电池储能可以帮助太阳能和风能规模化，他还相信**超热地热**（Super Hot Geothermal: 一种利用地下极高温地热资源发电的技术，具有稳定、低成本的潜力）是另一个我们尚未充分开发，但能提供极低成本、可持续可再生能源的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now solar power is not reliable or dispatchable you want to watch the game when the game is on not when the Sun's shining or the wind's blowing so we need to stabilize energy I'm pretty optimistic that Fusion will solve that problem battery storage can help solar and wind scale and I do believe geothermal super hot geothermal is another area we've not done enough working in that will provide very low cost sustainable Renewable Power.</p>
</details>

#### 预测十：资源将丰富，碳排放将得到解决

Khosla预测资源将丰富，碳排放将找到解决方案。他提到1960年代人们预测石油将达到峰值，但事实是，在合适的油价下，人们寻找石油，并发现了比想象中更多的石油。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh and more uh optimistic predictions resources will be plentiful and carbon will find Solutions you predicted peak oil in the 1960s and what happened is at the right price of oil people W looking for oil and we discovered a lot more oil than we imagined.</p>
</details>

我们现在在锂、铜、钴等矿物方面，就像1960年代的石油一样。我们只在表面以非常传统的方式寻找过。Khosla不认为我们已经开发出能够深入地下1到2公里的传感器，但这完全是可能的。他认为我们还没有使用**AI**来寻找矿物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we are in minerals like lithium copper Cobalt where we were in 1960 SE in oil we've only looked on the surface in very traditional ways I don't believe we've developed the sensors to go look a kilometer or two under the Earth but those are entirely possible I don't think we've used AI to start looking for minerals.</p>
</details>

他打赌在未来五到七年内，我们将开发出寻找矿物的工具，然后我们将发现更多的矿物。一旦我们有了更好的工具来寻找它们，就不会有短缺。我们还将以不寻常的方式学习回收。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so my bet is the next five seven years is about developing the tools to go look and then we will discover more minerals uh once we have the tools to find them much better and there won't be a shortage.</p>
</details>

Khosla非常乐观，认为在20年内，我们认为会短缺的铜、锂等资源，我们将学会更好地利用它们。通过**AI**，你可以进行结构设计，使用更少的钢和铜。但我们也会发现更多的矿物。他相信在20年内，我们将不再谈论矿物短缺，而是矿物过剩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we'll also learn recycling in unusual ways uh and so I'm pretty optimistic that if I look in 20 years the things we think will be short copper lithium high and over of course um one we will learn to use them much much better with AI you can do structural design that's much using much less steel um much less um copper but we will discover more minerals and I don't believe in 20 years we'll be talking about a mineral shortage we will be talking about a mineral glut.</p>
</details>

### 社会影响与挑战：政策与“不可能”的哲学

Khosla描绘了一个非常积极的世界图景，但也提到了可能阻碍这些趋势实现的因素。他认为这些事情相对不可预测。他回到“不可能”的观点，认为任何一个特定地点或国家都极不可能成为唯一的受益者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you paint um a very positive uh picture of the world here and you mentioned earlier some of the things which could hold this uh back from happening um which part of the world is going to benefit most from these Trends and where will there be the biggest uh obstacles for achieving these things so the one thing to keep in mind is these things are relatively unpredictable I go back to the improbable I'd say any one location if you ask me about a country uh that it is extremely improbable it'd be that country.</p>
</details>

但他总是说，我们不知道哪个“不可能”是重要的，但在成千上万个“不可能”中，总有一些“不可能”会变得非常可能。我们犯的错误是只看一件事，说它是“不可能”的，而没有意识到有成千上万种可能性，其中一种会成为改变世界的“可能”之事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I always say we don't know which improbable is important but among a thousand improbable some improbable is very probable and so the mistake we made in looking at one thing and saying that's improbable is not realizing there's a thousand possibilities thousand improbables one of which will become the probable thing that changes the world.</p>
</details>

例如，矿物会在喜马拉雅山被发现吗？可能，但他无法预测。它可能在海底，也可能在加利福尼亚的沙漠中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so will minerals be discovered in the Himalayas uh possible but I couldn't predict that it could be under the ocean it could be in in the deserts in California uh so.</p>
</details>

这就是他如此关注“不可能”的原因，并致力于创造更多“不可能”的机会。用曲棍球或足球术语来说，就是“射门次数越多，其中一个不可能的射门就会得分”。这才是我们应该采取的方法，而不是专家们所说的“证明这条路径在某个特定地方或国家存在”的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is the reason I focus so much on the improbable and creating many more improbables in in haky terms more shots on goal or soccer any any sport if you have more shots on goal one of those improvable shots will score for you and that is the approach we have to take not the approach experts say prove to me the path exists in a particular place or a country.</p>
</details>

这对于理解为什么大多数创新来自**硅谷**非常重要。这是一种将“不可能”变为可能，然后变为必然，最终使其实现的态度。这是一个从高度不确定性到高度确定性的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and this is very important in realizing why most of the innovation has come from Silicon Valley it's an attitude towards making the improbable happen taking the improbable making it possible then probable and then making it happen it's this journey from high uncertainty to high certainty.</p>
</details>

没有人想象过**Google**的世界，或者像**YouTube**、**Twitter**、**Meta**这样的媒体公司。传统广播公司在关注媒体时，甚至不知道它们在媒体业务中，但它们现在是市场价值上的主导媒体公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know nobody imagined the world of Google or the media companies you know YouTube Twitter mattera they weren't didn't even know they were in the media business when traditional broadcasters were looking at media but they are the dominant media companies now at least by market cap.</p>
</details>

这就是我们必须思考发明和创新的方式，允许许多事情失败。Khosla喜欢说，他不在乎一个项目有90%的失败几率，只要有10%的机会能改变世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this is how one has to take think about this world of invention and Innovation and allowing lots of things to fail I like to say I don't mind a 90% chance of failure on a project if there's a 10% % chance I change the world.</p>

### 给年轻人的建议：追求激情，拥抱丰裕

在这个世界里，Khosla给年轻人的建议是什么？他认为每个人都不同。20年后，他会告诉他们“追求你的激情”。他过去常说“只要你能谋生，就追求你的激情”，但他现在会去掉“只要你能谋生”这句话。

<p class="english-text">and in this world what is your advice to young people look each person's different 20 years from now I'll be telling them pursue your passions I used to say pursue your passions as long as you can make a living at it I'll drop the as long as you can make a living at it.</p>

因为他认为社会将有足够的丰裕，能够为每个人提供最低生活水平，无论他们是否有工作。六岁的孩子将不再被教导为了找工作而学习，而是为了探索兴趣或追求激情而学习。他认为这将是一个不同的世界。

<p class="english-text">because I think there'll be enough abundance in society for societies to support uh a minimum level of living for everybody independent of the job people kids at six years old won't be taught to study so they can get a job it'll be study so you can explore your interests or pursue your passions I think it'll be a different kind of world that's my advice to young people.</p>

对于今天这一代年轻人过去的那一代人，他们将面临艰难的过渡，因为工作岗位会流失和转型。这种颠覆是艰难的。

<p class="english-text">uh one generation past the generation of young people today these people in the middle will have a hard transition as we lose jobs as Jobs transition um it'll be hard the disruption is hard.</p>

Khosla认为，这种颠覆及其对人们的影响，可能会减缓变革的速度。但如果能将**GDP**增长从2%提高到5%或6%，那么在50年内将有足够的丰裕。我们可以计算出在这些**GDP**增长率和人均收入增长率下的情况。

<p class="english-text">um the rate of change will my bet slow down because of this disruption and how disruptive it can be on people who but abundance if he can change the world from 2% GDP growth to five or 6% there will be enough abundance in 50 years and we can do the math for GDP growth rates at those and per capita income growth rates at those levels.</p>

这将是一个美好的世界。过渡期会很艰难，会很困难，并将取决于政府政策。但在民主社会中，这些政策将由选民决定。Khosla认为我们将需要**全民基本收入**（Universal Basic Income: 一种政府定期向所有公民无条件支付固定金额的社会福利制度），并且我们将有资源负担得起。

<p class="english-text">It's a Wonderful World we can be in the transition will be hard it'll be difficult it'll depend on government policies but in democracy those policies will be determined by uh by voters and I think we will need things like Universal basic income in other things and we will have the resources to afford them.</p>

今天很难想象，也很“不可能”想象任何社会都能负担得起**全民基本收入**，但他认为这将是可能的。
