### 股市异动报告概述

The Stock Movers Report, your roundup of companies making moves in the stock market, harnessing the power of Bloomberg data.

《股市异动报告》，为您汇总利用彭博数据，在股市中有所表现的公司。

>> I'm Carol Master along with Isabelle Lee. Let's get to some stocks on the move. Bloomberg News equities reporter Natalyia Kiny Javich is here in the studio, and we've got to talk about the big banks.

我是卡罗尔·马斯特，和伊莎贝尔·李一起。让我们来看看一些活跃的股票。彭博新闻股票记者娜塔莉亚·金雅维奇在演播室，我们得谈谈那些大银行。

### 银行股表现：富国银行与摩根大通

They were definitely moving—some good, some bad. It is an interesting earnings season. So, let's start with Wells Fargo (ticker: WFC), the best performer in the **S&P 500** (Standard & Poor's 500: an index of 500 large U.S. companies). The stock is up by 7%.

它们确实在波动——有好有坏。这是一个有趣的财报季。所以，我们从富国银行（股票代码：WFC）开始，它是**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500: 衡量美国500家大型公司表现的指数）中表现最好的公司。该股上涨了7%。

Of course, this came after the bank raised its key profitability metric, the target for **return on tangible common equity** (ROTCE: a financial ratio that measures how efficiently a bank generates profit from its core capital), to a range between 17% and 18% from a previous level of 15%.

当然，这发生在银行将其关键盈利能力指标——**有形普通股权益回报率**（ROTCE: 衡量银行核心资本产生利润效率的财务比率）的目标区间从之前的15%上调至17%到18%之后。

Of course, it also came after the **Federal Reserve** (the central banking system of the United States) removed an **asset cap** (a regulatory limit on the total amount of assets a bank can hold) in June, as Wells Fargo was previously restricted from expanding its asset size. So now, this is a big development.

当然，这还得益于**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行系统）在6月解除了**资产上限**（asset cap: 对银行可持有资产总额的监管限制），因为我们知道富国银行曾被限制扩大其资产规模。因此，现在这是一个重大进展。

However, on the earnings side itself, we saw that **net interest income** (NII: the difference between the revenue generated from a bank's interest-bearing assets and the expenses associated with its interest-bearing liabilities) came below expectations. **EPS** (Earnings Per Share: a company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock) and revenue were in line.

然而，就盈利方面而言，我们看到**净利息收入**（NII: 银行生息资产收入与生息负债支出之间的差额）低于预期。**每股收益**（EPS: 公司利润除以其普通股流通股数）和营收则符合预期。

Another big bank we are watching is, of course, JP Morgan (ticker: JPM). The stock finished the trading session down by almost 2%.

另一家我们关注的大银行当然是摩根大通（股票代码：JPM）。该股收盘时下跌了近2%。

A couple of highlights: revenue was driven by **investment banking** (a specialized division of banking that helps individuals or organizations raise capital and provide financial advisory services) fees. For me, it's specifically interesting because I cover the **IPO market** (Initial Public Offering: the process of offering shares of a private corporation to the public in a new stock issuance) as well. We saw a recovery, but of course, CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted softness in the economy and labor market. This is kind of a "cockroach" or a "cockroach."

几个亮点：营收主要由**投资银行**（investment banking: 银行中帮助个人或组织筹集资金并提供金融咨询服务的专业部门）费用推动。对我来说，这特别有趣，因为我也关注**首次公开募股市场**（IPO market: 私人公司首次向公众发行新股的过程）。我们看到了复苏，但当然，首席执行官杰米·戴蒙也强调了经济和劳动力市场的疲软。这有点像“蟑螂”或“蟑螂”。

>> It can only happen in the U.S.

这只能发生在美国。

>> Got to love it. If you don't know who we're talking about, just check out the story at Bloomberg.com.

真是让人喜欢。如果你不知道我们在谈论谁，只需在Bloomberg.com上查看相关报道。

### 沃尔玛携手OpenAI：零售业新机遇

>> What about Walmart? This is also a really big American...

沃尔玛怎么样？这也是一个非常大的美国...

>> It is a big story. Just yesterday, right, we spoke about who else wanted to collaborate with OpenAI, and here we are.

这是一个大新闻。就在昨天，我们还在讨论还有谁想与OpenAI合作，现在就有了。

We have Walmart (ticker: WMT). The stock is up by almost 5%. This came after the announcement that the company will team up with **OpenAI** (an artificial intelligence research laboratory) and enable shoppers to browse and buy products on **ChatGPT** (a large language model developed by OpenAI). Of course, this is a big push.

我们有沃尔玛（股票代码：WMT）。该股上涨了近5%。这当然是公司宣布将与**OpenAI**（OpenAI: 一家人工智能研究实验室）合作，并使购物者能够在**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: 由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）上浏览和购买产品之后。当然，这是一个很大的推动。

Analysts are pretty excited about that; they see "significant opportunities." Specifically, UBS analysts are saying that, and D.A. Davidson analysts are saying that it is actually making the case for Walmart to be a winner among all **traditional retailers** (retail companies that operate physical stores, as opposed to purely online e-commerce businesses) in this kind of...

分析师们对此非常兴奋。他们看到了“重大机遇”。具体来说，瑞银分析师和D.A.戴维森分析师都表示，这实际上使沃尔玛在这种情况下，成为所有**传统零售商**（traditional retailers: 经营实体店而非纯粹在线电商业务的零售公司）中的赢家。

>> Doesn't it beg the question, "Who's next?" Do we now all of a sudden get a ton of buy buttons from everybody? I don't know.

这难道不引人深思吗，下一个是谁？我们现在是不是突然会收到来自所有人的大量购买按钮？我不知道。

>> Yes, you're right. This is something I didn't see coming, actually. But if you think about it, it kind of makes sense. Of course, you'd want AI to help you with whatever your shopping list is. And Matt earlier from TV made the case that he even uses ChatGPT for recipes.

是的，你说得对。这确实是我没有预料到的。但如果你仔细想想，这确实有点道理。当然，你会希望人工智能能帮助你处理购物清单上的任何事情。而且，早些时候电视上的马特还举例说，他甚至用ChatGPT来制作食谱。

>> He uses it for... Yeah, he totally does. Tim does the same thing. He'll be like, "Here's what's in my fridge," and so on and so forth. "What can I do with it?" I love it. I love playing with it. I've used it a little bit for work and stuff, but it's kind of fun.

他用它来……是的，他确实这么做。蒂姆也做同样的事情。他会说：“我的冰箱里有什么什么，等等等等。我能用它做什么？”我喜欢它。我喜欢玩它。我工作时也用过一点，但它挺有趣的。

### Atai生命科学：精神健康药物与市场前景

All right. There's a company I'm not familiar with, but it definitely was on the move today.

好的。有一家公司我不太熟悉，但它今天确实很活跃。

Yes, it is an interesting story. The company is called **Atai Life Sciences** (ticker: ATI).

是的，这是一个有趣的故事。这家公司叫做**Atai生命科学**（股票代码：ATI）。

The stock jumped by 11% today. This is a **clinical trial stage biopharmaceutical company** (a company that develops drugs and therapies, currently undergoing human testing before market approval). It was among the biggest movers today in the pharmaceutical space, alongside other **psychedelic stocks** (shares of companies involved in the research, development, or commercialization of psychedelic substances for therapeutic uses).

该股今天上涨了11%。这是一家处于**临床试验阶段的生物制药公司**（clinical trial stage biopharmaceutical company: 一家正在开发药物和疗法，目前正进行人体试验以获得市场批准的公司）。它今天在制药领域，与其他**致幻剂股票**（psychedelic stocks: 涉及致幻物质研究、开发或商业化用于治疗用途的公司的股票）一起，是涨幅最大的公司之一。

This came after a Republican state senator in North Carolina said that the state could "lead the nation in expanding military veterans' access to mental health drugs," because this company specifically develops treatments for mental health diseases.

这发生在一个北卡罗来纳州的共和党州参议员表示，该州可以在“扩大退伍军人获得精神健康药物的途径方面引领全国”之后，因为这家公司专门开发精神健康疾病的治疗方法。

This is according to a report from a publication called Marijuana Moment. So we do see that these stocks are on the move today.

这是根据一份名为《大麻时刻》的出版物的报道。所以我们确实看到这些股票今天都在上涨。

And Nēm initiated coverage of the company with a recommendation of "buy" and a price target of $12.

而且，Nēm公司开始覆盖该公司，给予“买入”评级，目标价为12美元。

>> Yeah. Not a company.

是的。不是一家公司。

>> Almost doubling today's price. By the way, the stock finished at six.

几乎是今天价格的两倍。顺便说一下，该股收盘价为6美元。

>> 351% higher this year.

今年上涨了351%。

>> Is that crazy?

这太疯狂了吧？

>> I feel like these companies, they can...

我觉得这些公司，它们可以...

>> ...we forget about them, and then when a big announcement comes, *bam*!

……我们就会把它们忘了，然后当一个重大消息传来时，砰！
