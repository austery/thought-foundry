### 特朗普与普京通话，战斧导弹交易生变

Today at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will meet with President Trump.
今天，乌克兰总统弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基将在白宫会见特朗普总统。

The two are expected to talk about a big thing on Zelenskyy's wish list: Tomahawk missiles.
两人预计将讨论泽连斯基愿望清单上的一件大事：**战斧导弹** (Tomahawk missiles: 一种远程巡航导弹)。

Ukraine is eager to buy them from the US because they have a range of more than a thousand miles, allowing the country to strike even deeper into Russia.
乌克兰渴望从美国购买这些导弹，因为它们的射程超过一千英里，能让乌克兰深入打击俄罗斯境内目标。

Lately, it's been ramping up its campaign to cause as much damage as possible to Russian targets, like oil refineries, as a way to bring Russia to the negotiating table.
最近，乌克兰一直在加大力度，尽可能多地破坏俄罗斯目标，例如炼油厂，以此迫使俄罗斯回到谈判桌。

The Tomahawks would be the longest-range weapons the US has ever provided to Ukraine.
战斧导弹将是美国有史以来向乌克兰提供的射程最远的武器。

And Trump said earlier this week he was open to making the sale.
特朗普本周早些时候表示，他对此项军售持开放态度。

The Pentagon drew up plans to transfer the missiles, awaiting Trump's order.
**五角大楼** (Pentagon: 美国国防部所在地，代指美国国防部) 已经制定了移交导弹的计划，只待特朗普的命令。

But yesterday, Trump got on the phone with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
但昨天，特朗普与俄罗斯领导人弗拉基米尔·普京通了电话。

After speaking with him for two hours, Trump abruptly changed his tone on the weapons.
在与普京通话两小时后，特朗普突然改变了对这些武器的态度。

"We have a lot of them, but we need them. I mean, we can't deplete for our country. So, you know, they're very vital. They're very powerful."
“我们有很多，但我们也需要它们。我的意思是，我们不能为了其他国家而耗尽自己的库存。所以，你知道，它们非常重要，非常强大。”

He suggested he might hold them back if Putin is willing to negotiate an end to the war.
他暗示，如果普京愿意谈判结束战争，他可能会扣留这些导弹。

"Right. But did President Putin try to dissuade you from selling Tomahawk missiles?"
“好的。但是普京总统有没有试图劝阻您不要出售战斧导弹？”

"Well, of course. What do you think he's going to say? Please sell Tomahawks."
“嗯，当然了。你觉得他会说什么？‘请出售战斧导弹’吗？”

Trump's apparent pivot on the missiles is part of a pattern of how he's dealt with Putin.
特朗普在导弹问题上的明显转变，是他处理与普京关系模式的一部分。

Multiple times this year, Trump has been on the brink of putting new sanctions on Russia or giving new military aid to Ukraine, only to have a conversation with Putin and come out of it pushing for more talks instead.
今年多次，特朗普都曾濒临对俄罗斯实施新**制裁** (sanctions: 一国为政治或经济目的对另一国施加的限制) 或向乌克兰提供新的军事援助，但每次与普京通话后，他都会转而推动更多谈判。

Each time, Putin has then continued the Russian assault on Ukraine.
而每次，普京都会继续俄罗斯对乌克兰的攻击。

Critics say it's a trap that Trump has fallen into again.
批评人士称，这是特朗普再次陷入的陷阱。

Trump says he plans to meet with Putin face to face in the next two weeks at a summit in Hungary.
特朗普表示，他计划在未来两周内于匈牙利的一次峰会上与普京面对面会晤。

### 前国家安全顾问约翰·博尔顿被起诉

On Thursday, John Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, was indicted for mishandling classified information.
周四，特朗普总统的前**国家安全顾问** (National Security Adviser: 总统在国家安全事务上的高级幕僚) 约翰·博尔顿因不当处理机密信息而被起诉。

He's facing 18 counts that could send him to prison for the rest of his life.
他面临18项指控，可能导致他终身监禁。

Prosecutors say that when Bolton was serving in Trump's first term, he sent more than a thousand pages of notes about his day-to-day activities, which included top secret defense information, to his family members.
检察官表示，博尔顿在特朗普第一任期内任职时，曾向家人发送了上千页关于他日常活动的笔记，其中包括绝密国防信息。

Those notes sometimes came from his AOL or Gmail accounts.
这些笔记有时来自他的美国在线（AOL）或Gmail账户。

At one point, prosecutors say Bolton followed one of them up with a message saying, "None of which we talked about."
检察官称，有一次博尔顿在发送其中一份笔记后，又发了一条消息说：“我们什么都没谈过。”

The person responded, "Sh."
对方回复“嘘”。

Making matters worse, Bolton's emails were later hacked by someone associated with the government of Iran.
更糟糕的是，博尔顿的电子邮件后来被与伊朗政府有关联的人入侵。

Bolton's relationship with Trump eventually imploded, and Bolton went on to publish a highly critical behind-the-scenes book about the administration.
博尔顿与特朗普的关系最终破裂，博尔顿随后出版了一本对该政府持高度批评态度的幕后书籍。

Now, he's the latest in a string of Trump's perceived enemies to be charged by the Justice Department.
现在，他是司法部起诉的特朗普一系列“假想敌”中的最新一位。

But my colleague Devlin Barrett, who covers the DOJ, says it is different from the recent indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.
但我的同事德夫林·巴雷特（Devlin Barrett）负责报道**司法部** (DOJ: Department of Justice: 负责执行法律、维护司法公正的美国联邦政府部门)，他说这与最近对前**联邦调查局局长** (FBI Director: Federal Bureau of Investigation: 美国联邦政府的主要调查机构负责人) 詹姆斯·科米和纽约州**总检察长** (Attorney General: 负责州或联邦政府法律事务的最高官员) 莱蒂西亚·詹姆斯的起诉有所不同。

For those cases, Trump installed his former personal lawyer, who had no prosecutorial experience, to bring the charges.
在那些案件中，特朗普任命了他没有检察经验的前私人律师来提起指控。

For one thing, the prosecutors who have handled this case are the career prosecutors inside the Justice Department who normally handle national security cases, and they're the ones that brought this case to the grand jury and got the indictment.
首先，处理此案的检察官是司法部内通常处理国家安全案件的职业检察官，正是他们将此案提交给**大陪审团** (Grand Jury: 在美国法律体系中，负责决定是否有足够证据对某人提起刑事诉讼的陪审团) 并获得了起诉。

It's also different because this investigation, which sort of began in the first Trump administration, really gained new momentum during the Biden years and was investigated and taken seriously during the period of time in which Joe Biden was the president and his attorney general was running the Justice Department.
此外，此案的不同之处在于，这项调查虽然在特朗普第一任期内就开始了，但在拜登执政期间获得了新的动力，并在乔·拜登担任总统、其司法部长领导司法部期间得到了认真调查和对待。

So, it's not the same procedure, the same alarming procedure that you saw in some of these other cases involving people that Trump has publicly criticized.
因此，这与你在其他一些涉及特朗普公开批评的人的案件中看到的、令人担忧的程序不同。

Bolton is expected to make his first court appearance later today in Maryland.
博尔顿预计将于今天晚些时候在马里兰州首次出庭。

In a statement, he said his indictment was part of an intimidation campaign against critics of President Trump, writing, "I look forward to the fight to defend my lawful conduct and to expose his abuse of power."
他在一份声明中表示，他的起诉是针对特朗普总统批评者的恐吓运动的一部分，他写道：“我期待着为我的合法行为辩护，并揭露他滥用权力。”

### 特朗普政府的其他更新：海军上将离职与体外受精倡议

Now, two other updates on the Trump administration.
现在，关于特朗普政府的另外两项最新消息。

The US military commander, who oversees all operations in Central and South America, where the US has been carrying out strikes on boats it says were smuggling drugs, is stepping down.
负责监督美国在中南美洲所有军事行动的指挥官即将卸任。美国一直在该地区对涉嫌走私毒品的船只进行打击。

Admiral Alvin Holsey is leaving the position suddenly, less than a year into what's typically a three-year job.
海军上将阿尔文·霍尔西（Alvin Holsey）突然离职，而这个职位通常任期三年，他上任还不到一年。

It's unclear why, but one current US official and one former one told the Times that Holsey had raised concerns about the recent boat attacks.
原因尚不清楚，但一位现任和一位前任美国官员告诉《泰晤士报》，霍尔西曾对最近的船只袭击表示担忧。

The administration has said the strikes were necessary to prevent dangerous drugs from entering the US, though many experts in military law have questioned the administration's claim that it can lawfully kill people suspected of drug trafficking instead of arresting them.
政府表示，这些袭击是为了阻止危险毒品进入美国所必需的，尽管许多军事法律专家质疑政府声称可以合法杀死涉嫌贩毒者而非逮捕他们的说法。

With Holsey's departure, there was no public mention of any friction over that issue.
霍尔西离职时，没有公开提及与该问题相关的任何摩擦。

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth thanked the admiral for his service on social media, and Holsey in a statement urged those in his command to "keep charging."
国防部长皮特·赫格塞斯（Pete Hegseth）在社交媒体上感谢了这位海军上将的服务，霍尔西也在一份声明中敦促他的下属“继续冲锋”。

Also, "the initiatives I've just announced are the boldest and most significant actions ever taken by any president to bring the miracle of life into more American homes."
此外，“我刚刚宣布的这些举措是任何总统为将生命的奇迹带入更多美国家庭所采取的最为大胆和重要的行动。”

In the Oval Office yesterday, President Trump announced an initiative to make **in vitro fertilization** (IVF: 体外受精: 一种辅助生殖技术，将卵子和精子在体外结合，再将胚胎植入子宫) more accessible for Americans.
昨天在椭圆形办公室，特朗普总统宣布了一项倡议，旨在让美国人更容易获得体外受精（IVF）服务。

He said the goal is to reduce the cost of the drugs necessary for IVF and to encourage more employers to offer coverage for it just like they do dental or vision.
他说，目标是降低IVF所需药物的成本，并鼓励更多雇主像提供牙科或视力保险一样，为IVF提供保险。

At the moment, it's unclear how much the plan will lower the price, which can hit $15,000 or $20,000 for a single IVF cycle, or if companies will get on board.
目前尚不清楚这项计划能将单次IVF周期的费用（可能高达1.5万或2万美元）降低多少，也不确定公司是否会参与。

The announcement is one of Trump's clearest efforts yet to embrace the **pro-Natalist movement** (鼓励生育运动: 旨在提高出生率的社会或政治运动), which is aimed at raising the US birth rate.
这项声明是特朗普迄今为止最明确地支持鼓励生育运动的努力之一，该运动旨在提高美国的出生率。

Dr. Mehmet Oz, who joined the administration in April, said at the event, "I know what you're all thinking, and you're probably right. There are going to be a lot of Trump babies."
今年4月加入政府的穆罕默德·奥兹博士在活动中说：“我知道你们都在想什么，你们可能猜对了。将会有很多‘特朗普宝宝’。”

Notably, the president stopped short of requiring employers to cover IVF, potentially in deference to some Christian conservatives in his base who are staunchly against the procedure, saying they have ethical concerns with IVF because it can involve discarding human embryos.
值得注意的是，总统并未强制要求雇主覆盖IVF费用，这可能是为了尊重其支持者中一些坚决反对该程序的基督教保守派，他们表示对IVF存在伦理担忧，因为它可能涉及丢弃人类胚胎。

### 伊朗推广性别转换手术作为医疗旅游

And finally, "Welcome to Iran, a land of breathtaking beauty and world-class healthcare."
最后，“欢迎来到伊朗，一个拥有令人惊叹的美景和世界级医疗服务的国家。”

The Times has been covering how in Iran, with the country's economy crippled by war and sanctions, the government is trying to promote medical tourism as a way to bring in outside cash.
《泰晤士报》一直在报道伊朗的情况：由于战争和制裁导致国家经济瘫痪，政府正试图推广医疗旅游，以此引入外部资金。

"Imagine receiving the highest quality of care in cutting-edge medical facilities all while experiencing the warmth and hospitality of Iran."
“想象一下，在尖端医疗设施中获得最高质量的护理，同时体验伊朗的温暖和热情。”

They've been pushing the country as a destination for hair transplants, nose jobs, and also for **gender transition surgeries** (性别转换手术: 旨在改变个体身体特征以符合其性别认同的外科手术) for **transgender** (跨性别: 指个体性别认同与出生时被指定的性别不一致) foreigners.
他们一直在将该国推广为植发、隆鼻以及为跨性别外国人提供性别转换手术的目的地。

For 40 years, Iran has performed more gender transition surgeries than many other countries in the world.
四十年来，伊朗进行的性别转换手术数量超过世界上许多其他国家。

But it's not because the country has embraced trans rights.
但这并非因为该国接受了跨性别者的权利。

It's because they have extremely strict views on gender norms.
而是因为他们对性别规范持有极其严格的看法。

My colleague Pranav Bhasin has been reporting on transition surgeries in Iran.
我的同事普拉纳夫·巴辛（Pranav Bhasin）一直在报道伊朗的转换手术。

He says that for years the conservative Iranian government has forced **gender non-conforming** (性别不符合者: 指其性别表达或性别认同与社会对性别的刻板印象不符的人) people to undergo transition surgeries.
他说，多年来，保守的伊朗政府一直强迫性别不符合者接受转换手术。

For example, a transman might be pressured into having a mastectomy.
例如，一名跨性别男性可能会被迫进行乳房切除术。

People who don't submit to them can face extreme punishments like public flogging or even the death penalty.
不服从者可能面临严厉惩罚，如公开鞭刑甚至死刑。

Under that system, Iranian doctors perform, by some estimates, thousands of transition surgeries every year, giving them extensive experience in those procedures.
在这种制度下，据估计，伊朗医生每年进行数千例转换手术，这使他们在这些手术方面积累了丰富的经验。

And Pranav says they're charging foreigners a lot less than they would pay elsewhere.
普拉纳夫说，他们向外国人收取的费用比其他地方要低得多。

For example, a surgery that could cost $45,000 in the United States could go for 10 times cheaper in Iran.
例如，在美国可能花费4.5万美元的手术，在伊朗可能便宜10倍。

You know, we found that those cut-rate prices are drawing transgender individuals from as far away as Australia, the United States, Britain, and Europe.
我们发现，这些低廉的价格吸引了来自澳大利亚、美国、英国和欧洲等地的跨性别者。

But even as Iran is becoming more widely advertised as the destination for gender transition surgery, there's firstly concerns about safety.
但即使伊朗作为性别转换手术目的地被广泛宣传，首先仍存在安全担忧。

Some activists have likened the country's gender clinics to butcher shops.
一些活动家将该国的性别诊所比作屠宰场。

And according to some reports, there have been complications like bleeding and infection associated with the surgeries.
根据一些报道，这些手术伴随着出血和感染等并发症。

And adding to the risks are questions about whether there will be rush timelines.
此外，风险还包括手术时间表是否会过于仓促。

For operations that experts say typically involve months of planning and post-operative care, medical tourism groups are marketing timelines as quick as 7 to 9 days.
专家称通常需要数月规划和术后护理的手术，医疗旅游团体却将其宣传为7到9天即可完成。

At the same time, many trans foreigners traveling to Iran for transition surgery who we spoke to described a tension and conflict that they were navigating because they were glad that there was a place that they could go to to get access to this sort of medical care that they saw as life-saving.
与此同时，我们采访的许多前往伊朗进行转换手术的跨性别外国人描述了他们所面临的紧张和冲突，因为他们很高兴能有一个地方获得他们视为救命的医疗服务。

But they were also troubled that the place that they had to go to had such a long history of targeting and persecuting **LGBTQ** (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer: 女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别者、酷儿: 指性少数群体) people.
但他们也感到困扰，因为他们不得不前往的这个地方，长期以来一直针对和迫害性少数群体。

现在是问答时间。每周我们都会问你几个关于《泰晤士报》报道过的新闻故事的问题。你能全部答对吗？

Okay, first up. "It's not doing anything. Not doing anything."
好的，第一个。“它什么也没做。什么也没做。”

"In recent weeks, there have been tense confrontations between federal agents and protesters across the country as crowds have gathered to push back on the government's escalating immigration operations."
“最近几周，随着人群聚集起来抵制政府不断升级的移民行动，全国各地联邦特工与抗议者之间发生了紧张的对抗。”

"In one city, some of those protests have had an unusual look with demonstrators dressed as frogs, unicorns, raccoons, pickles. We're in costumes to show just how ridiculous that is. It's not a war zone."
“在一个城市，一些抗议活动呈现出不同寻常的景象，示威者打扮成青蛙、独角兽、浣熊、泡菜。我们穿着服装是为了展示这有多么荒谬。这不是战区。”

"People even stood by an **ICE facility** (Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民和海关执法局) there this past week in a coordinated naked bike ride."
“上周，人们甚至在那里的一处移民和海关执法局（ICE）设施旁，进行了一场有组织的裸体自行车骑行活动。”

"We're here representing peace. We're here representing love."
“我们在这里代表和平。我们在这里代表爱。”

Your question, what city is this happening in?
你的问题是，这发生在哪个城市？

The answer, Portland, Oregon.
答案是俄勒冈州波特兰。

Those big jiggling inflatable costumes have become particularly popular at the protests there, giving some otherwise intense scenes with arrests and tear gas a sort of surreal look.
那些巨大的摇晃充气服装在当地的抗议活动中特别受欢迎，给原本紧张的逮捕和催泪瓦斯场景带来了一种超现实的色彩。

A man who's been wearing a chicken onesie to protests told the Times, "It just makes it seem sillier when they come after us."
一名穿着鸡形连体衣参加抗议的男子告诉《泰晤士报》：“当他们追捕我们时，这只会让事情显得更荒谬。”

Okay, next question. In the US, the government shutdown has now stretched into a third week.
好的，下一个问题。在美国，政府停摆现在已经进入第三周。

Flights have been delayed. Workers are furloughed. Some national parks have closed. And in DC, anyone hoping to enjoy DC's beloved museums is now out of luck.
航班延误。工人被强制休假。一些国家公园关闭。在华盛顿特区，任何希望享受华盛顿特区备受喜爱的博物馆的人现在都运气不佳。

"The **Smithsonian museums** (史密森尼博物馆群: 位于美国华盛顿特区，由多个博物馆和研究中心组成的综合体) have shut."
“史密森尼博物馆群已关闭。”

"Came here for an exhibit, so just a little disappointed. Of course,"
“来这里看展览的，所以有点失望。当然，”

"that means tourists are being turned away from some of the most popular destinations in the city where millions of people go every year to see the collections."
“这意味着游客被拒之门外，无法进入这座城市每年吸引数百万人参观藏品的一些最受欢迎的目的地。”

We're going to ask you if you can identify three of the most iconic objects the Smithsonian has in its possession.
我们将问你是否能识别出史密森尼博物馆收藏的三件最具标志性的物品。

We'll give you a little audio clues. Ready? Here's the first one. It's some very famous footwear.
我们会给你一些音频线索。准备好了吗？这是第一个。这是一双非常著名的鞋子。

"Give them back to me. Give them back."
“还给我。还给我。”

"Keep tight inside of them. Their magic must be very powerful or she wouldn't want them so badly."
“紧紧地穿着它们。它们的魔力一定非常强大，否则她不会如此渴望它们。”

"You stay on this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well."
“你给我老实点，格林达，否则我也要收拾你。”

The answer, a set of ruby slippers that Judy Garland wore when she played Dorothy in the **Wizard of Oz** (绿野仙踪: 一部经典的美国奇幻电影).
答案是朱迪·加兰在电影《绿野仙踪》中扮演多萝西时穿的那双红宝石鞋。

"There's no place like home. There's no place like home."
“没有地方比得上家。没有地方比得上家。”

Okay, next one. It is the object that inspired this pretty famous song.
好的，下一个。它就是这首相当著名的歌曲的灵感来源。

What object is that an Ode to?
那首歌是献给哪个物品的？

The answer. The Smithsonian has the actual **Star-Spangled Banner** (星条旗: 美国国歌的名称，也指美国国旗), the slightly tattered American flag that flew over the ramparts at **Fort McHenry** (麦克亨利堡: 位于美国马里兰州巴尔的摩，是1812年战争中的重要防御工事) in the rockets' red glare and all that during the **War of 1812** (1812年战争: 美国与英国及其盟友之间的一场冲突).
答案是。史密森尼博物馆收藏着真正的《星条旗》，那面在1812年战争期间，火箭的红色火光中飘扬在麦克亨利堡城墙上，略显破旧的美国国旗。

And your last object is some important gear from an athlete who Sports Illustrated called the sportsman of the 20th century.
你的最后一个物品是一位运动员的重要装备，他被《体育画报》评为20世纪最伟大的运动员。

"I have wrestled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. Out and handcuffed lightning, throw thunder in jail."
“我曾与鳄鱼搏斗。我曾与鲸鱼缠斗。我曾制服闪电，将雷霆投入监狱。”

Name that athlete and his gear that is at the Smithsonian.
说出这位运动员的名字以及他在史密森尼博物馆的装备。

A little hint, you would not want to be on the receiving end of it.
一个小提示，你不会想成为它的承受者。

The answer, **Muhammad Ali**'s (穆罕默德·阿里: 20世纪最伟大的拳击手之一) boxing gloves.
答案是穆罕默德·阿里的拳击手套。

"Only last week I murdered a rock. Angela Stone,"
“就在上周，我谋杀了一块石头。安吉拉·斯通，”

known for his boxing more than his humility. When Ali donated them to the Smithsonian, he predicted the gloves would become "the most famous thing in this building."
他以拳击而非谦逊闻名。当阿里将它们捐赠给史密森尼博物馆时，他预言这副手套将成为“这座建筑里最著名的东西”。

And final question, in Chicago last year, "So you had to come and see for yourself, huh?"
最后一个问题，去年在芝加哥，“所以你不得不亲自来看看，是吗？”

"I couldn't believe it until I saw with my own eyes."
“我亲眼看到之前都不敢相信。”

"A segment of the sidewalk became one of the city's most unexpected landmarks and an internet sensation."
“一段人行道成为了这座城市最意想不到的地标之一，并在互联网上引起轰动。”

"It's not our favorite distinction in the city of Chicago being known as the rattiest city. This is not helping."
“芝加哥被称为‘老鼠最多的城市’，这并不是我们最喜欢的称号。这无济于事。”

Nicknamed the **Chicago rat hole** (芝加哥老鼠洞: 芝加哥人行道上一个形似老鼠印记的凹陷), or Splatouille.
它被称为“芝加哥老鼠洞”或“鼠来宝”。

It was a mark where something seemed to have fallen into the cement while it was still wet, leaving a pretty cartoony impression, complete with what looks like little outstretched arms.
这是一个印记，似乎有什么东西在水泥还湿的时候掉进了里面，留下了一个相当卡通的印记，甚至还有看起来像是伸展的小手臂。

But this week, a team of researchers announced the findings of an investigation they'd done, saying, "We can affirmatively conclude that this imprint was not created by a rat."
但本周，一个研究团队公布了他们调查的结果，称：“我们可以肯定地得出结论，这个印记并非由老鼠造成。”

So, your question, what did they find created it? I'm going to give you four options. A, a child's toy. B, a squirrel. C, a prankster who drew it into the cement. D, an unlucky frog.
所以，你的问题是，他们发现是什么造成的？我给你四个选项。A，一个儿童玩具。B，一只松鼠。C，一个恶作剧者把它画进了水泥里。D，一只倒霉的青蛙。

Again, those options are toy, squirrel, artistic human, or frog.
再说一遍，这些选项是玩具、松鼠、有艺术天赋的人，或者青蛙。

The answer, the scientists said they are 99% certain it was either an **eastern gray squirrel** (东部灰松鼠: 一种常见于北美洲东部的松鼠) or a **fox squirrel** (狐松鼠: 北美洲体型最大的树松鼠之一).
答案是，科学家们表示，他们有99%的把握，那是一只东部灰松鼠或一只狐松鼠。

Now, to be fair, there were some rat hole truthers out there all along,
公平地说，一直以来都有一些“老鼠洞真相论者”，

"but I just don't believe that a rat like hops in the air and belly flaps straight down."
“但我就是不相信一只老鼠会像那样跳到空中，然后肚子朝下直接拍下去。”

The theory goes that the squirrel fell out of a tree onto the wet cement, immortalizing itself.
理论认为，那只松鼠从树上掉到了湿水泥上，从而使自己永垂不朽。

The scientists say squirrels actually fall a lot. My question, since there are definitely no little footprints leading away from the rat hole squirrel dent, what happened to it?
科学家说松鼠实际上经常摔倒。我的问题是，既然“老鼠洞松鼠印”周围肯定没有小脚印，那它后来怎么样了？

No, that is it for the news quiz. Our email, as always, is theheadlines@nytimes.com.
好了，新闻问答就到这里。我们的电子邮件一如既往是theheadlines@nytimes.com。

If you want to send us your score, tell us how you did. Tell us where that squirrel is now.
如果你想把你的分数发给我们，告诉我们你做得怎么样。告诉我们那只松鼠现在在哪里。

I'm Tracy Mumford. The headlines will be back on Monday.
我是特蕾西·芒福德。《头条新闻》周一再见。
