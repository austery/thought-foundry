### 法西斯主義的敏感性與定義挑戰

Taiwanese politics often slaps labels on political opponents, calling them Nazis or fascists.

台灣政治中，常有人給政敵貼標籤，稱他們為納粹或法西斯。

In the 1994 Taipei mayoral candidate debate, Chu Li-lun's analogy of judicial investigation to "Nazis" sparked protests.

在1994年的台北市長候選人辯論中，朱立倫將司法調查比喻為「納粹」引發了抗議。

Recent controversial remarks have drawn attention from the European Economic and Trade Office in Taiwan, with many people calling it a disgrace to the country.

近期一些爭議性言論引發了歐洲經貿辦事處在台灣的關注，許多人稱之為國恥。

In Taiwanese society, people often imitate Hitler and the Nazis as a joke. The Guangfu High School students' Nazi parade sparked controversy and was slammed as ignorant. Song Jianliang wore a Nazi armband while being questioned, leading netizens to rage: "KMT is disgracing Taiwan." The initiator of Green Recall dressed as a Nazi, which the German Representative in Taiwan strongly condemned as a "shameless act," as reported by TVBS News.

在台灣社會中，人們常把模仿希特勒和納粹當作玩笑。光復高中學生扮納粹遊行引發爭議，被批無知。宋健樑戴納粹臂章應訊，網友怒批：「國民黨丟台灣的臉。」綠色罷免發起人扮納粹，德國在台協會強烈譴責其「無恥行徑」，TVBS新聞報導。

Why is "fascist" such a sensitive label internationally? And how do you identify people or political parties with fascist tendencies? Is it possible for fascism to make a comeback in the 21st century? In today's video, we're going to talk about what exactly fascism is.

為什麼「法西斯」在國際上是一個如此敏感的標籤？你又該如何辨識具有法西斯傾向的人或政黨？在21世紀，法西斯主義有可能捲土重來嗎？在今天的影片中，我們將探討法西斯主義究竟是什麼。

Historically, various fascist groups have been some conservative, some radical, making it not easy to find a universal definition. However, scholars believe that fascism has several distinct characteristics.

歷史上，各種法西斯群體有的保守，有的激進，這使得找到一個普世定義並不容易。然而，學者們認為法西斯主義有幾個鮮明的特徵。

### 法西斯主義的五大核心特徵

First, it is a **totalitarian state system** (Totalitarian State System: 一種政府形式，其中國家對公共和私人生活實行絕對控制), with a single party under one person.

首先，它是一個**極權國家體制**，由一人領導的單一政黨統治。

Second, it usually has a **charismatic leader** (Charismatic Leader: 憑藉個人魅力和說服力來激發追隨者忠誠的領導人) ruling dictatorially, whose words can even outweigh scientific authority. For example, Hitler said, "Science is only useful when it benefits the nation."

第二，它通常有一個**魅力型領袖**獨裁統治，這位獨裁者的言論甚至可以凌駕於科學權威之上。例如，希特勒曾說：「科學只有在為民族利益服務時才有意義。」

Third, fascism is inherently an **exclusionary nationalism** (Exclusionary Nationalism: 強調國家身份排他性，常伴隨對外來者的敵意) and **racism** (Racism: 認為一個種族優於另一個種族，並基於種族差異進行歧視的信念). For example, the eugenics promoted by the **Nazis** (Nazis: 德國國家社會主義工人黨成員) is an extreme case.

第三，法西斯主義本質上是一種**排他性民族主義**和**種族主義**。例如，納粹所推崇的優生學就是一個極端案例。

Fourth, fascism has a **crisis narrative** (Crisis Narrative: 透過宣揚國家面臨威脅來煽動民眾情緒的故事或論述) that incites voters, and it is passionate about promoting **national rejuvenation** (National Rejuvenation: 旨在恢復國家昔日榮耀和強盛的運動或目標).

第四，法西斯主義擁有一種煽動選民的**危機敘事**，並且熱衷於推動**民族復興**。

Fifth, **fascism** (Fascism: 一種極權主義的民族主義政治意識形態) is essentially **reactionary** (Reactionary: 反對社會進步，主張回歸過去傳統秩序的政治觀點), believing that social progress brought about by liberal democracy, the left, and feminism are all harming their interests.

第五，法西斯主義本質上是**反動**的，它認為自由民主、左派和女性主義帶來的社會進步都在損害他們的利益。

### 法西斯思想的早期原型

The best way to understand fascism is to look at the environment in which it emerged. In the late 19th century, in the salt marshes on the Mediterranean coast of France, rumor had it that three French workers were killed by Italian migrant workers. Police began detaining Italians, and French society was filled with an atmosphere of hostility towards foreign migrant workers.

了解法西斯主義最好的方式，就是看看它誕生的環境。19世紀末，法國地中海沿岸的鹽沼地區，有傳聞稱三名法國工人被義大利移工殺害。警方開始拘捕義大利人，法國社會瀰漫著對外籍移工的敵意氛圍。

Maurice Barrès, a French writer hailed as the father of fascism at the time, pointed out that national identity originates from the history, traditions, and myths of a land. He argued that because French farmers have always grown up on this land, they are a naturally formed community with the land and have more legitimacy to govern society, stating that foreign immigrants can never replace true French people.

當時被譽為法西斯主義之父的法國作家莫里斯·巴雷斯指出，民族認同源於一片土地的歷史、傳統和神話。他認為，由於法國農民一直在這片土地上生長，他們與這片土地形成了一個自然共同體，因此擁有治理社會的更高合法性，並聲稱外國移民永遠無法取代真正的法國人。

In 1889, Barrès further used local anti-Semitic sentiment to run for office. In this case, we see the prototype of fascist thought: a form of **xenophobic right-wing nationalism** (Xenophobic Right-Wing Nationalism: 結合排外情緒與右翼民族主義思想的政治立場).

1889年，巴雷斯進一步利用當地反猶太情緒競選公職。在這個案例中，我們看到了法西斯思想的原型：一種**排外右翼民族主義**。

### 民族主義的演變與異化

Actually, from the 19th to the early 20th century, nationalism was originally a relatively progressive left-wing ideology. At that time, many colonized people would use the idea of **national self-determination** (National Self-Determination: 各民族有權自由決定自己的政治地位和發展道路的原則) to challenge the empires of the time. However, in order to challenge foreign colonial regimes, nationalism often appealed to some kind of romanticized indigenous roots.

實際上，從19世紀到20世紀初，民族主義最初是一種相對進步的左翼意識形態。當時，許多被殖民的人民會利用**民族自決**的思想來挑戰當時的帝國。然而，為了挑戰外來殖民政權，民族主義往往訴諸某種浪漫化的本土根源。

For example, when Italy was first unified into a nation-state in the 19th century, it was the Italian revolutionary Mazzini who promoted nationalism for national liberation, believing that the people shared a common cultural origin, and therefore the divided small states on the Italian peninsula could be merged into one country.

例如，19世紀義大利首次統一為民族國家時，正是義大利革命家馬志尼提倡民族主義以實現民族解放，他認為人民擁有共同的文化淵源，因此義大利半島上分裂的小國可以合併成一個國家。

When a country is first created, certain national myths often emerge to maintain the community, which in itself is not a problem. The problem is that national myths were transformed into national superiority by the far right at that time, becoming weapons for them to fight for power.

當一個國家初創時，某些民族神話常會出現以維繫社群，這本身並不是問題。問題在於，民族神話在當時被極右翼轉化為民族優越感，成為他們爭奪權力的武器。

For example, after the German unification in 1870, many Germans felt that Germany wasn't truly unified because the population within its borders wasn't a unified ethnicity.

例如，1870年德國統一後，許多德國人覺得德國並未真正統一，因為其境內人口並非單一民族。

German Romantic philosopher Julius Langbehn, in his book 'Rembrandt as Educator,' proposed a **Volkish philosophy** (Volkish Philosophy: 德國浪漫主義思想，強調民族血統、文化和土地的統一性), arguing that nationalism is built on the unity of ethnic identity, a group with consistent moral values, clearly defined by bloodline and culture, a natural community, different from those who immigrate later.

德國浪漫主義哲學家尤利烏斯·朗貝恩在其著作《倫勃朗作為教育家》中提出了一種**民族主義哲學**，主張民族主義建立在民族身份的統一性上，這是一個具有一致道德價值觀、由血統和文化明確定義的自然共同體，與後來的移民不同。

He praised Rembrandt of the Netherlands and Goethe of Germany as heroes of the Germanic people, advocating for the revival of Germanic virility, while claiming Jews were the poison of society. This book immediately became a bestseller after its publication and later became the ideological foundation of Nazism.

他讚揚荷蘭的倫勃朗和德國的歌德為日耳曼民族的英雄，倡導復興日耳曼人的陽剛之氣，同時聲稱猶太人是社會的毒瘤。這本書出版後立即成為暢銷書，後來成為納粹主義的意識形態基礎。

### 危機敘事與群眾心理操控

But how did this kind of exclusionary ethnocentric superiority arise? One school of thought believes it's because 19th-century European society underwent rapid capitalist modernization, which disrupted traditional order and widened the wealth gap. Many local farmers and laborers became losers in modernization, but the ruling class said this was historical progress.

但這種排他性的民族中心優越感是如何產生的呢？有一種觀點認為，這是因為19世紀歐洲社會經歷了快速的資本主義現代化，傳統秩序被顛覆，貧富差距擴大。許多當地農民和勞工成為現代化的失敗者，但統治階級卻稱這是歷史進步。

At this time, the far right took the opportunity to seize power and incite the masses, providing emotionally charged explanations, saying that "our country is facing a crisis and heading for decline. The culprit is that group of foreign forces controlling the homeland."

此時，極右翼趁機奪權並煽動群眾，提供情緒化的解釋，聲稱「我們的國家正處於危機之中，走向衰落。罪魁禍首是那群控制祖國的外來勢力。」

The far right promised the public to "make the country great again," restoring its former glory, portraying themselves as spokespersons for national liberation, and allowing the masses to emotionally identify with them.

極右翼向公眾承諾「讓國家再次偉大」，恢復昔日榮耀，將自己描繪成民族解放的代言人，讓群眾從情感上認同他們。

Starting in the 1880s, various anti-Semitic conspiracy theories circulated in Europe. The Jewish Rothschild family was seen as the embodiment of controlling global capitalism. The French far-right boycotted Jewish-owned department stores in Paris. Russia's Black Hundreds even promoted the conspiracy theory that Jews wanted to overthrow the Tsar, demonstrating in the streets and killing hundreds of Jews. These far-right tactics later became common strategies for fascists.

從19世紀80年代開始，各種反猶太陰謀論在歐洲流傳。猶太羅斯柴爾德家族被視為控制全球資本主義的象徵。法國極右翼抵制巴黎猶太人經營的百貨公司。俄羅斯黑百人團甚至宣傳猶太人想推翻沙皇的陰謀論，在街頭示威並殺害了數百名猶太人。這些極右翼策略後來成為法西斯主義者的常用手段。

The psychologist Le Bon observed that European politics in the late 19th century had already shifted from the elite politics of the past to mass politics. He noted that whoever controls the emotions of the masses can control the votes, and that the truth doesn't matter to the masses; what matters is providing them with the illusion they crave. Fascism grasped this principle.

心理學家勒龐觀察到，19世紀末的歐洲政治已經從過去的精英政治轉變為大眾政治。他指出，誰控制了群眾的情緒，誰就能控制選票，而真相對群眾來說並不重要；重要的是提供群眾渴望的幻覺。法西斯主義抓住了這一原則。

The rise of Mussolini and Hitler both occurred when they emerged during social unrest and said, "Our country is declining and on the verge of collapse." They used this to stir up patriotic sentiments and mobilize society's losers, using an external enemy to strengthen internal identity, but in reality, it was to destroy the enemy within the country in order to achieve political power.

墨索里尼和希特勒的崛起都發生在他們於社會動盪中出現，並宣稱「我們的國家正在衰落，瀕臨崩潰」之時。他們利用這一點來煽動愛國情緒，動員社會上的失敗者，利用外部敵人來強化內部認同，但實際上，這是為了消滅國內的敵人，以獲取政治權力。

So the philosopher Adorno called the psychological manipulation techniques of fascists "**displaced aggression** (Displaced Aggression: 將對某個對象的敵意或不滿轉移到另一個較安全的對象上)," transferring the aggression generated by the public's dissatisfaction with society onto a group of scapegoats, saying "it's all the Jews' fault," or attributing it to "the intervention of some foreign power."

因此，哲學家阿多諾將法西斯主義者的心理操控技術稱為「**轉移性攻擊**」，將公眾對社會不滿產生的攻擊性轉移到一群替罪羊身上，聲稱「這都是猶太人的錯」，或是歸咎於「某些外國勢力的干預」。

"If the people elect me to power, I will expel all these people." That's how fascists can gain popular support, because it satisfied the psychological need for emotional release.

「如果人民選我上台，我就會驅逐所有這些人。」這就是法西斯主義者能夠獲得民眾支持的方式，因為它滿足了情感宣洩的心理需求。

### 大蕭條與法西斯主義的崛起

During the Great Depression of 1929, fascists propagated the idea that it was a conspiracy of Jews and Freemasons. But these claims only led to the rise of fascism in Europe and not in the United States. Even though the Great Depression was most severe in the US, why is that?

在1929年大蕭條期間，法西斯主義者宣揚這是一場猶太人和共濟會的陰謀。但這些說法只導致了法西斯主義在歐洲的崛起，而不是在美國。儘管大蕭條在美國最為嚴重，這是為什麼呢？

Because the American New Deal quickly solved the problems and successfully quelled social discontent, it's not the case that extreme fascism automatically arises simply from widespread poverty and hardship.

因為美國的羅斯福新政迅速解決了問題，並成功平息了社會不滿，所以極端法西斯主義並非單純由普遍的貧困和困境自動產生。

Because throughout human history, periods of widespread poverty and hardship have been everywhere, but only at certain times did fascist regimes emerge. So, to understand fascism more deeply, we should understand it through exemplary cases, that is, to understand the most typical fascists: post-World War I Italy and Nazi Germany.

因為縱觀人類歷史，普遍貧困和困境的時期無處不在，但只有在某些特定時期才出現了法西斯政權。因此，要更深入地理解法西斯主義，我們應該透過典型案例來理解它，也就是了解第一次世界大戰後的義大利和納粹德國這兩個最典型的法西斯國家。

### 義大利法西斯主義的興起

After World War I ended in 1919, although Italy was one of the victors, it didn't get much in the way of benefits or territory. Italians felt this was a "**mutilated victory** (Vittoria Mutilata: 第一次世界大戰後義大利對其戰果不滿的說法)."

1919年第一次世界大戰結束後，儘管義大利是戰勝國之一，但並未獲得多少實質利益或領土。義大利人認為這是一場「**被閹割的勝利**」。

Mussolini rose to power amidst this wave of discontent, presenting himself as a representative of the working people, and more capable of controlling the country and creating a new Italy.

墨索里尼正是在這股不滿浪潮中崛起，他將自己塑造成勞動人民的代表，並聲稱自己更有能力控制國家並創造一個新義大利。

He organized the "**Fascist Fighting Leagues** (Fasci di Combattimento: 墨索里尼創建的準軍事組織)." The word Fascis originally meant "bundle of rods," that is, a bunch of wooden rods tied together, a symbol of authority in ancient Rome. Mussolini used this word to symbolize power concentrated in the hands of the state. He quickly won the support of small farmers because these people all felt the government was incompetent.

他組織了「**法西斯戰鬥隊**」。Fascis這個詞最初的意思是「一捆棍棒」，也就是一束捆綁在一起的木棍，它是古羅馬的權力象徵。墨索里尼用這個詞來象徵國家權力集中。他很快贏得了小農的支持，因為這些人都覺得政府無能。

By 1922, Mussolini's Fascist Party already had 250,000 members. He organized the "**March on Rome** (March on Rome: 1922年義大利法西斯黨發動的政變行動)" to pressure the ruling party with a demonstration, and finally successfully launched a coup.

到1922年，墨索里尼的法西斯黨已經擁有25萬名成員。他發起了「**向羅馬進軍**」，透過示威向執政黨施壓，最終成功發動了政變。

After Mussolini was elected Prime Minister of Italy, he attacked the left wing, amended the election law, and restricted freedom of the press so that members of the Fascist Party could obtain a majority of seats in Congress.

墨索里尼當選義大利總理後，他攻擊左翼，修改選舉法，並限制新聞自由，使得法西斯黨成員得以在國會中獲得多數席位。

During the election, political opponent Giacomo Matteotti exposed election fraud. As a result, Mussolini actually sent people to kidnap and murder Matteotti, which caused a public outcry in Italy.

在選舉期間，政治對手賈科莫·馬泰奧蒂揭露了選舉舞弊。結果，墨索里尼竟然派人綁架並謀殺了馬泰奧蒂，這在義大利引起了公憤。

The fascist rule implemented by Mussolini after taking office wasn't actually based on any complete ideology, but simply to seize power and eliminate political enemies. It was later systematized into a complete ideology by Giovanni Gentile, Mussolini's personal philosopher.

墨索里尼上任後實施的法西斯統治，實際上並非基於任何完整的意識形態，而僅僅是為了奪取權力並剷除政治敵人。它後來才由墨索里尼的私人哲學家喬瓦尼·詹蒂萊將其系統化為一套完整的意識形態。

Gentile said, "When we Italians close our eyes, we can feel our Italian soul in our bones. This Italian soul is inherited from the ancient Roman culture of thousands of years ago."

詹蒂萊說：「當我們義大利人閉上眼睛時，我們能感覺到義大利靈魂在我們的骨子裡。這個義大利靈魂繼承自數千年前的古羅馬文化。」

Therefore, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, in order to make Italy's economy independent of imports, Mussolini promoted "nationalism of the Roman spirit." He encouraged the Italian people to eat more domestic rice and support local farmers, and not to eat imported pasta, because pasta is a modern invention and ancient Romans ate bread. He claimed that relying on pasta as the main food would not restore the glory of ancient Roman civilization. This kind of nationalism is the ideology that fascists developed to consolidate power when faced with economic crises.

因此，在1930年代大蕭條期間，為了讓義大利經濟擺脫對進口的依賴，墨索里尼推動了「羅馬精神的民族主義」。他鼓勵義大利人民多吃國產稻米，支持當地農民，不要吃進口義大利麵，因為義大利麵是現代發明，古羅馬人吃的是麵包。他聲稱，依賴義大利麵作為主食，將無法恢復古羅馬文明的榮耀。這種民族主義正是法西斯主義者在面臨經濟危機時，為鞏固權力而發展出的意識形態。

### 納粹德國：極端種族主義與生存空間

We can see a similar trajectory in the example of Nazi Germany. After World War I, Germany was a defeated nation, bearing huge reparations. Added to that was the Great Depression of 1929, with severe inflation and six million people unemployed in Germany.

在納粹德國的例子中，我們可以看到類似的軌跡。第一次世界大戰後，德國作為戰敗國，背負著巨額賠款。再加上1929年的大蕭條，德國面臨嚴重的通貨膨脹和六百萬人失業。

Hitler claimed to be inspired by Mussolini, packaging himself as a representative of the masses, claiming that if the Nazi Party came to power, it could restore discipline and order to Germany. In the short term, he gained a lot of support from farmers.

希特勒聲稱受到墨索里尼的啟發，將自己包裝成群眾的代表，宣稱如果納粹黨上台，就能恢復德國的紀律和秩序。短期內，他獲得了農民的大量支持。

In 1932, a quarter of German workers voted for the Nazis. Finally, in 1933, Germany signed the "**Enabling Act** (Enabling Act: 1933年德國通過的法案，賦予希特勒無需議會批准即可立法的權力)," stating that bills announced by the Chancellor, even if unconstitutional, did not need parliamentary confirmation. This was equivalent to ending the rule of law in Germany and turning the country into one commanded by the will of the leader.

1932年，四分之一的德國工人投票支持納粹。最終，1933年德國簽署了「**授權法案**」，規定總理宣布的法案，即使違憲，也無需議會確認。這相當於終結了德國的法治，將國家變成了由領袖意志指揮的國家。

After gaining dictatorial rule, the Nazis quickly froze freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and banned trade unions. Even the selection of civil servants depended on loyalty to the party.

獲得獨裁統治權後，納粹迅速凍結了新聞自由、集會自由，並禁止工會。甚至公務員的選拔也取決於對黨的忠誠度。

But the Nazis had a key difference from other fascist groups: it wasn't just xenophobic patriotism; it developed into a unique form of racism, emphasizing the need to sacrifice other races to achieve the prosperity of the German Aryans. This was the Nazis' guiding principle.

但納粹與其他法西斯團體有一個關鍵區別：它不只是排外愛國主義；它發展成一種獨特的種族主義形式，強調需要犧牲其他種族來實現德意志雅利安人的繁榮。這是納粹的指導原則。

A set of eugenics listed which races were inferior and detrimental to the prosperity of the German nation, such as Jews, homosexuals, and people with physical and mental disabilities. These weak individuals had to be sterilized in order to improve the quality of the German population. At the same time, women were encouraged to marry and have children to increase the nation's population, because to the state, this was equivalent to raising future soldiers.

一套優生學列出了哪些種族是劣等的，對德意志民族的繁榮有害，例如猶太人、同性戀者以及身心障礙者。這些弱勢個體必須被絕育，以提高德國人口的素質。同時，女性被鼓勵結婚生育以增加國家人口，因為對國家而言，這等同於培養未來的士兵。

A key concept in Nazi eugenics was "**Lebensraum** (Lebensraum: 納粹德國主張擴張領土以供「雅利安人」生存和繁衍的理論)" (living space), believing that Aryans were the master race. The master race reproduces and multiplies endlessly, which would naturally cause overpopulation. Therefore, it was "inevitable" to expand their territory outwards, even if it meant sacrificing inferior races in other regions. This concept of Lebensraum was used by the Nazis to justify the colonization of various places.

納粹優生學中的一個關鍵概念是「**生存空間**」，認為雅利安人是主宰民族。主宰民族不斷繁殖和增長，自然會導致人口過剩。因此，向外擴張領土是「不可避免的」，即使這意味著犧牲其他地區的劣等民族。納粹利用這種生存空間的概念來為其在各地殖民辯護。

### 中國國民黨的法西斯化歷史

But to expand outwards, you need various arms and strategic materials, and the country with the richest mines at that time was the Republic of China. So Nazi Germany actually had a little-known diplomatic partnership with the Chinese Nationalist Party.

但要向外擴張，你需要各種武器和戰略物資，而當時礦產最豐富的國家就是中華民國。所以納粹德國實際上與中國國民黨有著鮮為人知的外交夥伴關係。

In the 1930s, during the **Sino-German cooperation period** (Sino-German Cooperation Period: 1930年代中華民國與納粹德國在軍事、經濟上的合作階段), the Nazis sent General Hans von Seeckt to China as a military advisor to assist the Nationalist Party in military modernization and control military power. Chiang Kai-shek sent his adopted son Chiang Wei-kuo to Nazi Germany to study and join the Wehrmacht. Chiang Kai-shek and Hitler often exchanged congratulatory telegrams.

在1930年代的**中德合作時期**，納粹派漢斯·馮·塞克特將軍到中國擔任軍事顧問，協助國民黨進行軍事現代化並控制軍權。蔣介石將其養子蔣緯國送往納粹德國留學並加入德國國防軍。蔣介石和希特勒經常互致賀電。

Because it was during the Chinese Civil War and the Japanese invasion of China, the Chinese people had a strong sense of national crisis. After seeing Mussolini and the Nazis come to power, and their dictatorial rule quickly address national crises, a view became popular among the Chinese people that democratic politics are inefficient and dictatorial rule is truly powerful.

由於當時正值中國內戰和日本侵華，中國人民有著強烈的民族危機感。在看到墨索里尼和納粹上台，以及他們的獨裁統治迅速解決了國家危機後，中國人民中流行一種觀點，認為民主政治效率低下，而獨裁統治才是真正強大的。

In 1932, Chiang Kai-shek imitated Mussolini's Blackshirts. He created a secret organization called the "**Blue Shirts Society** (Blue Shirts Society: 中國國民黨內的一個秘密組織，模仿法西斯模式)," also known as the "**Three People's Principles Vigorously Practiced Society** (Three People's Principles Vigorously Practiced Society: 藍衣社的正式名稱)." Most of its members were graduates of the **Whampoa Military Academy** (Whampoa Military Academy: 中國國民黨的軍事院校，培養了大量軍官). They hoped to learn from the Fascist model to make the Kuomintang's rule stronger and to support Chiang Kai-shek as the supreme authority and core belief in the hearts of the people.

1932年，蔣介石模仿墨索里尼的黑衫軍，創建了一個名為「**藍衣社**」的秘密組織，又稱「**三民主義力行社**」。其大部分成員都是**黃埔軍校**的畢業生。他們希望學習法西斯模式，以強化國民黨的統治，並將蔣介石塑造成人民心中的最高權威和核心信仰。

This organization, within six years, rapidly grew to a scale of 500,000 people. Chiang Kai-shek sent people to Germany and Italy many times to study the Fascist operating model.

這個組織在六年內迅速發展到50萬人的規模。蔣介石多次派人到德國和義大利考察法西斯的運作模式。

One of the inspectors, Hu Gui, saw that the Germans under Nazi rule lived in an orderly manner. After returning to China, he suggested to Chiang Kai-shek that to save China from its impending doom, it was necessary to launch a national revival movement, like Germany and Italy, to restore the glory of ancient Rome. He proposed that China should also revive the traditional Confucian virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor, changing the street names of the Republic of China to those of ancient sages and worthies, and advocating militarized life education. This is the **New Life Movement** (New Life Movement: 蔣介石在中國推行的一項社會改革運動，旨在提升國民道德和紀律) promoted by Chiang Kai-shek.

其中一位考察員胡軌，看到納粹統治下的德國人生活秩序井然。回國後，他向蔣介石建議，要挽救中國於危亡，必須發起一場民族復興運動，像德國和義大利一樣，恢復古羅馬的榮耀。他提議中國也應復興傳統儒家禮義廉恥的美德，將中華民國的街道名稱改為古代聖賢，並提倡軍事化的生活教育。這就是蔣介石推動的**新生活運動**。

This historical moment shows Chiang Kai-shek promoting the New Life Movement, preparing China for a total war of resistance. That's why Harvard historian William Kirby said that China's modernization process, starting in the 1930s, was a hybrid combination of fascism and traditional Confucian culture. He argued that the golden decade of China's modernization was actually rooted in the KMT's history of fascisizing China.

這個歷史時刻顯示，蔣介石推動新生活運動，為中國的全面抗戰做準備。這就是哈佛歷史學家柯偉林所說的，中國自1930年代開始的現代化進程，是法西斯主義與傳統儒家文化的混合體。他認為，中國現代化的黃金十年，實際上根植於國民黨的中國法西斯化歷史。

And after the KMT fled to Taiwan in 1949, it essentially brought fascist dictatorship to Taiwan, establishing a highly militarized police state. Therefore, Taiwan's democratization movement is not just about fighting against dictatorship; behind it is also a struggle against a certain Chinese-style fascism.

而國民黨在1949年逃到台灣後，實質上將法西斯獨裁帶到了台灣，建立了一個高度軍事化的警察國家。因此，台灣的民主化運動，不僅僅是反抗獨裁統治；其背後也是一場反抗某種中國式法西斯主義的鬥爭。

### 當代社會如何辨識法西斯傾向：階級視角

Now that we've introduced the classic examples of fascism, how do we identify whether contemporary society or political parties have fascist tendencies? Because fascism has now become a term of abuse, no political party would call itself fascist. But we can examine whether an individual or group has fascist tendencies from three perspectives: race, gender, and class.

既然我們已經介紹了法西斯主義的經典案例，那麼我們該如何辨識當代社會或政黨是否具有法西斯傾向呢？因為法西斯主義現在已經成為一個罵人的詞，沒有任何政黨會自稱法西斯。但我們可以從種族、性別和階級三個角度來檢視個人或團體是否具有法西斯傾向。

First, on the issue of class. Many fascists, like Mussolini and Hitler, would call themselves "**National Socialists** (National Socialists: 德國納粹黨員的自稱，與國際社會主義相對)." This title was in opposition to the then "**International Socialism** (International Socialism: 馬克思主義思想，主張世界工人階級團結，不分國界)," which is what Marx believed, that workers have no country and should unite all over the world to fight against capitalism.

首先，從階級問題來看。許多法西斯主義者，像墨索里尼和希特勒，都會自稱「**國家社會主義者**」。這個稱謂是為了對抗當時的「**國際社會主義**」，也就是馬克思所主張的，工人沒有祖國，全世界工人應該團結起來反對資本主義。

But National Socialism believes, "No. Of course, workers have a country. The labor movement should prioritize native-born locals. Domestic workers and capitalists should tolerate each other for the sake of national interests. If capitalists can treat local workers well, then they will not unite with foreign workers to rebel. Everyone will become more patriotic, building a harmonious nation, instead of engaging in class struggle as Marx said."

但國家社會主義者認為：「不。工人當然有祖國。勞工運動應該優先考慮本土的當地人。國內的工人和資本家為了國家利益應該相互容忍。如果資本家能善待當地工人，那麼他們就不會與外國工人聯合起來反叛。每個人都會變得更加愛國，建立一個和諧的國家，而不是像馬克思所說的那樣搞階級鬥爭。」

Hitler told the German masses, "Workers must return to the bosom of the fatherland and fight against those who destroy the nation," which meant uniting with German capitalists to fight against Jewish capitalists. So, fascism doesn't essentially challenge the capitalist system; it just makes capital also obey the interests of the state. Because the fascist regime would help capitalists destroy the left-wing labor movement, big businesses supported the Nazis after they came to power. This way, the state could say to the workers, "See, now everyone, regardless of class, is striving for the country. We've become more patriotic."

希特勒告訴德國群眾：「工人必須回到祖國的懷抱，並與那些破壞國家的人作鬥爭」，這意味著與德國資本家團結起來對抗猶太資本家。所以，法西斯主義本質上不挑戰資本主義制度；它只是讓資本也服從國家利益。因為法西斯政權會幫助資本家摧毀左翼勞工運動，所以大企業在納粹上台後支持了他們。這樣一來，國家就可以對工人說：「看，現在每個人，不論階級，都在為國家奮鬥。我們變得更加愛國了。」

### 當代社會如何辨識法西斯傾向：種族視角

Next is the fascist attitude towards race. Starting in the late 19th century, the far right viewed Jews as a race, rather than a religion, thereby regarding them as an unassimilable foreign element.

接下來是法西斯主義對種族的態度。從19世紀末開始，極右翼將猶太人視為一個種族，而非一種宗教，從而將他們視為無法同化的外來元素。

Because the view of European progressives at the time was that as long as a person lives in a country for a long time, they will be assimilated as a member, possessing similar language, culture, and values. Therefore, this person should be given equal civil rights; what race you are is not the question.

因為當時歐洲進步派的觀點是，一個人只要在一個國家長期生活，就會被同化為其中一員，擁有相似的語言、文化和價值觀。因此，這個人應該被賦予平等的公民權利；你的種族是什麼並不是問題。

But the controversy lies in: how much time does it take to assimilate into a member of society? The fascist writer Barrès believed that it takes centuries of living on French soil to cultivate a French national character.

但爭議在於：需要多長時間才能同化為社會成員？法西斯作家巴雷斯認為，需要數百年生活在法國土地上，才能培養出法國民族性格。

Hitler, on the other hand, believed that survival of the fittest is the struggle for existence between races, and every race wants to control and dominate. They all pursue racial purity and prevent infiltration by foreign races. He argued that it was because too many Jews were equal citizens that the racial interests of the Aryans were violated.

另一方面，希特勒認為適者生存是種族間的生存鬥爭，每個種族都想控制和主宰。他們都追求種族純潔，防止外來種族滲透。他認為，正是因為太多猶太人成為平等公民，才侵犯了雅利安人的種族利益。

For example, Hitler said that the sex industry was invented by Jews to spread venereal diseases and exterminate white people. In order to maintain racial purity, the Nazis issued a series of policies prohibiting marriage between Jews and Aryans, implementing sterilization policies for people with **hereditary diseases** (Hereditary Diseases: 由基因異常引起的疾病，可從父母傳給子女), and ultimately systematically exterminating Jews. These are all due to fascist racism.

例如，希特勒說性產業是猶太人發明的，旨在傳播性病並消滅白人。為了維持種族純潔，納粹頒布了一系列政策，禁止猶太人與雅利安人通婚，對患有**遺傳性疾病**的人實施絕育政策，最終系統性地滅絕猶太人。這些都源於法西斯種族主義。

After World War II, racial equality was universally recognized as a universal human right. So in contemporary political debates, even far-right anti-immigration groups will deny being racist. Instead, they argue that opening up to immigration is actually racial discrimination against native people because it infringes on the rights of local white people.

第二次世界大戰後，種族平等被普遍認為是普世人權。所以在當代政治辯論中，即使是極右翼的反移民團體也會否認自己是種族主義者。相反，他們辯稱開放移民實際上是對本土人民的種族歧視，因為這侵犯了當地白人的權利。

Like the recent right-wing rhetoric popular in Europe, saying "if we open up to Muslim immigrants, and they have more and more children in Europe, eventually white people will become a minority population in Europe. That is racial oppression against white people." They use this to advocate for restricting immigration or repatriating illegal immigrants. So, on racial issues, to identify whether someone has fascist tendencies, you can look at their arguments to see if they incite hatred against certain races.

就像最近在歐洲流行的右翼言論，聲稱「如果我們對穆斯林移民開放，而他們在歐洲生下越來越多的孩子，最終白人將成為歐洲的少數民族。那便是對白人的種族壓迫。」他們利用這一點來主張限制移民或遣返非法移民。因此，在種族問題上，要辨識一個人是否具有法西斯傾向，你可以觀察他們的論點，看他們是否煽動對某些種族的仇恨。

For example, saying that all Muslims are terrorists, or that all Indians are rapists, and that "if we allow these people to immigrate, our country will be doomed." These xenophobic remarks with racial discrimination carry a fascist tone.

例如，聲稱所有穆斯林都是恐怖分子，或者所有印度人都是強姦犯，以及「如果我們允許這些人移民，我們的國家將會滅亡」。這些帶有種族歧視的排外言論都帶有法西斯色彩。

### 當代社會如何辨識法西斯傾向：性別視角

Lastly, fascism also had its own view on gender issues. Fascists abhorred feminists and gender equality, and advocated for 'separate but equal' roles for men and women. They believed a woman's natural duty was to take care of the family and have children, and thought true equality meant women doing what they were suited for.

最後，法西斯主義對性別問題也有自己的看法。法西斯主義者厭惡女性主義和性別平等，主張男女「分而平等」的角色。他們認為女性的天職是照顧家庭和生育子女，並認為真正的平等意味著女性做她們適合做的事情。

However, during the two World Wars, men were all at the front lines fighting. Women in the rear actually dominated city life, taking on positions that were originally held by men. Many women's groups sprung up like mushrooms after rain. This development made Fascists at the time feel that women could compete with men for the same positions, and that becoming like men meant they were no longer women.

然而，在兩次世界大戰期間，男性都在前線作戰。後方的女性實際上主導了城市生活，承擔了原本由男性擔任的職位。許多女性團體如雨後春筍般湧現。這一發展讓當時的法西斯主義者覺得，女性可以與男性競爭相同的職位，而變得像男性意味著她們不再是女性。

For example, French Fascist novelist Pierre Drieu La Rochelle lamented: "This civilization will henceforth be without gender." He believed women being able to do men's jobs was a symbol of civilizational decline. And the Romanian Fascist organization Iron Guard declared that educated women would leave society barren. They wanted to restrict women's access to education and keep women at home, because a woman's mission was to reproduce for the white race.

例如，法國法西斯小說家皮埃爾·德里厄·拉羅歇爾感嘆：「這種文明從此將沒有性別。」他認為女性能夠從事男性工作是文明衰落的象徵。而羅馬尼亞法西斯組織「鐵衛團」則宣稱，受過教育的女性會讓社會變得貧瘠。他們希望限制女性受教育的機會，並讓女性待在家中，因為女性的使命是為白人種族繁衍後代。

Because the two World Wars caused Europeans to die on the battlefield, the population plummeted, and society expected women to help have more children to replenish the population. So, on the one hand, Fascists hated women; on the other hand, they wanted women to become perfect mothers. You might think, how could women possibly support this view?

因為兩次世界大戰導致歐洲人在戰場上喪生，人口銳減，社會期望女性能幫助生育更多孩子來補充人口。因此，一方面，法西斯主義者憎恨女性；另一方面，他們又希望女性成為完美的母親。你可能會想，女性怎麼可能支持這種觀點呢？

But after the Nazis took power, there were 2 million female members, because the Fascists knew very well that to mobilize women for the nation, they had to give them some benefits. For example, allowing women to work as medical staff, teachers, and social workers, giving them the feeling of contributing to the country. At the same time, the Fascists would also implement some social welfare policies, making women feel that the demands of the women's movement were being realized. In this way, women would voluntarily take on the role of being a good mother.

但納粹上台後，卻有200萬女性成員，因為法西斯主義者很清楚，要動員女性為國家服務，就必須給予她們一些好處。例如，允許女性擔任醫務人員、教師和社工，讓她們感覺自己在為國家做貢獻。同時，法西斯主義者也會實施一些社會福利政策，讓女性覺得女性運動的要求正在實現。這樣，女性就會自願扮演好母親的角色。

For example, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, the Nazi women's leader, had 11 children herself, leading the way as a good mother.

例如，納粹女性領袖格特魯德·朔爾茨-克林克自己生育了11個孩子，以身作則扮演好母親。

Fascism doesn't just make demands of women; it also makes demands of men. For example, the Nazis emulated the samurai code of **Bushido** (Bushido: 日本武士階層的道德規範) and the **Teutonic Knights'** (Teutonic Knights: 中世紀歐洲的一個軍事修會) military ethos, considering this a model for demonstrating masculinity. They believed homosexuals, lacking masculinity, violated the distinction between men and women. So the Nazi regime also cracked down on homosexuality, forcing them to undergo treatment. Tens of thousands of homosexuals were sent to concentration camps and executed.

法西斯主義不僅對女性提出要求，也對男性提出要求。例如，納粹模仿**武士道**的武士行為準則和**條頓騎士團**的軍事精神，將其視為展現男子氣概的典範。他們認為同性戀者缺乏男子氣概，違反了男女之間的區別。因此，納粹政權也打擊同性戀，強迫他們接受治療。數萬名同性戀者被送往集中營處決。

Some scholars believe this is actually because strong same-sex friendships easily develop within highly masculine fascist groups, so homosexual desires must be deliberately suppressed. They suggest some homophobic fascists are actually deeply closeted. For example, Ernst Rohm, a pioneer of the Nazi **Sturmabteilung** (Sturmabteilung: 納粹黨的準軍事組織，又稱褐衫軍), was a typical masculine soldier, but he was secretly gay.

一些學者認為，這實際上是因為在高度男性化的法西斯團體中，很容易發展出強烈的同性友誼，因此必須刻意壓制同性戀慾望。他們認為一些恐同的法西斯主義者實際上是深櫃。例如，納粹**衝鋒隊**的先驅恩斯特·羅姆就是一個典型的陽剛士兵，但他卻是個秘密的同性戀者。

So, on gender issues, to identify whether someone has fascist tendencies, you can look at how they discuss gender equality. People with fascist tendencies will say that feminism, homosexuality, and transgenderism will cause human civilization to collapse. Fascist parties will order that schools cannot teach feminism or gender equality, because these gender "progressive" and "equal" ideas will lead the country to ruin. They believe it is necessary to return to a certain past gender order to restore society to normal.

因此，在性別問題上，要辨識一個人是否具有法西斯傾向，你可以觀察他們如何討論性別平等。具有法西斯傾向的人會說，女性主義、同性戀和跨性別會導致人類文明崩潰。法西斯政黨會下令學校不能教授女性主義或性別平等，因為這些性別「進步」和「平等」的思想會導致國家走向毀滅。他們認為，有必要回到某種過去的性別秩序，才能讓社會恢復正常。

### 法西斯主義的當代警示：美國案例

We might think fascism is a thing of the past, something far removed from us. But many scholars studying fascism today point out that the United States after Trump's inauguration has gradually become fascist.

我們可能會認為法西斯主義已是過去式，離我們很遙遠。但許多研究法西斯主義的學者指出，川普上任後的美國，已逐漸法西斯化。

"Fascism is what the current Trump administration is doing. For the past decade, we've been debating whether this is fascism. People argue about whether it's authoritarianism or fascism. My view now is that we shouldn't waste time continuing to argue about it."

「法西斯主義就是當前川普政府正在做的事情。在過去十年中，我們一直在爭論這是否是法西斯主義。人們爭論這到底是威權主義還是法西斯主義。我現在的看法是，我們不應該繼續浪費時間爭論這個問題。」

Let's review the characteristics of fascism. Fascism skillfully uses a crisis narrative to incite voters. It tells you, "our country is being invaded by some external force, like immigrants, feminism, the left, the elite class, those out-of-touch media elites, [and] political elites." They claim that "those elites, these forces, under the guise of equality and progress, have infiltrated the national media, campuses, and government agencies. There may be a crisis of national extinction."

讓我們回顧法西斯主義的特徵。法西斯主義巧妙地利用危機敘事來煽動選民。它告訴你，「我們的國家正受到某種外部勢力的入侵，比如移民、女性主義、左派、精英階層、那些脫離現實的媒體精英，以及政治精英。」他們聲稱，「這些精英，這些勢力，打著平等和進步的幌子，已經滲透到國家媒體、校園和政府機構。國家可能面臨滅絕危機。」

After spreading this crisis narrative, fascist leaders will claim that their own people's race is superior. "We will make the country great again. We Americans are stronger, tougher, crazier, and smarter. Just elect me, and I can handle this crisis. I am your voice. I alone can fix today's crisis." This allows fascists to transform the country into a totalitarian government through democratic elections.

在散布這種危機敘事後，法西斯領導人會聲稱自己民族的種族優越。「我們將讓國家再次偉大。我們美國人更強壯、更堅韌、更瘋狂、更聰明。只要選我，我就能處理這個危機。我是你們的聲音。我一個人就能解決今天的危機。」這讓法西斯主義者能夠透過民主選舉將國家轉變為極權政府。

Recently, Elon Musk directly gave a Nazi salute at Trump's inauguration, causing an uproar among netizens. "I just want to say thank you for making this happen. Thank you. My heart is with you."

最近，伊隆·馬斯克在川普的就職典禮上直接行了納粹禮，引起了網友的軒然大波。「我只想說謝謝你們讓這一切發生。謝謝你們。我的心與你們同在。」

After Trump took office, he carried out a massive deportation of Venezuelan immigrants, even though a federal judge had ruled the deportation illegal. Trump did not comply with the judicial ruling and committed **contempt of court** (Contempt of Court: 違反法庭命令或對法庭權威不敬的行為), claiming that the president alone is above the law.

川普上任後，對委內瑞拉移民進行了大規模驅逐，儘管一位聯邦法官已裁定驅逐非法。川普不遵守司法裁決，構成了**藐視法庭**，聲稱總統一人凌駕於法律之上。

Next is restricting people's freedom of speech, such as freezing Harvard University's $2.2 billion budget and forbidding Americans from protesting Israel's slaughter of Palestinians. This led Harvard University to sue the Trump administration.

接下來是限制人民的言論自由，例如凍結哈佛大學22億美元的預算，並禁止美國人抗議以色列屠殺巴勒斯坦人。這導致哈佛大學起訴川普政府。

More than 150 American university presidents jointly signed a statement, stating that the Trump administration is interfering with American universities' academic freedom and freedom of speech, and that the president's will overrides the scientific community. Many American scholars feel censored and unable to conduct academic research. Therefore, recently three American Yale University authorities on fascism studies, Jason Stanley, Marci Shore, and Timothy Snyder, decided to leave the United States.

超過150位美國大學校長聯合簽署了一份聲明，指出川普政府正在干預美國大學的學術自由和言論自由，並且總統的意志凌駕於科學界之上。許多美國學者感到受到審查，無法進行學術研究。因此，最近三位美國耶魯大學法西斯主義研究權威——賈森·史丹利、瑪西·肖爾和蒂莫西·斯奈德——決定離開美國。

They issued a warning to the world after leaving the United States, stating that the United States is gradually becoming fascist. The lesson we learned from 1933 is: "You better get out early, or it will be too late. I've spent a lot of time in the past decade trying to get people to prepare if Trump got elected, let alone twice. You know you're living in a fascist society when you constantly think: Am I safe right now? The country we want is one where nobody has to worry about their safety."

他們在離開美國後向世界發出警告，聲稱美國正逐漸法西斯化。我們從1933年學到的教訓是：「你最好早點離開，否則就太遲了。在過去十年中，我花了很多時間試圖讓人們做好準備，如果川普當選，更別說連任了。當你不斷地想：我現在安全嗎？你就知道你生活在一個法西斯社會裡。我們想要的國家是沒有人需要擔心自己安全的國家。」
