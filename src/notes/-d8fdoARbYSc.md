### 《鬼灭之刃：无限城篇》的哲学深思

Today we're going to dive into the movie analysis of "Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Arc".

今天我们将深入分析电影《鬼灭之刃：无限城篇》。

"The Infinity Castle Arc" unfolds with three battles: Butterflies Shinobu vs Upper Rank Two Doma, Zenitsu vs Upper Rank Six Gyutaro, Tanjiro and Giyu vs Upper Rank Three Akaza.

《无限城篇》主要围绕三场战役展开：蝴蝶忍对战上弦之贰童磨，善逸对战上弦之陆妓夫太郎，以及炭治郎和富冈义勇对战上弦之叁猗窝座。

These three scenes touch on a key theme of Demon Slayer: What does a demon actually mean?

这三场战斗都触及了《鬼灭之刃》的一个关键主题：恶鬼究竟意味着什么？

### 恶鬼的本质与历史演变

Demon Slayer is set in Japan's Taisho era, and Muzan is at least 1,000 years old.

《鬼灭之刃》的故事背景设定在**大正时代** (Taisho era: 日本历史时期，1912-1926年)，而鬼舞辻无惨至少有1000岁。

Back-calculating puts his origin around the 10th century AD.

回溯计算，他的起源大约在公元10世纪。

Muzan had already become Japan's first demon in history.

彼时，无惨已成为日本历史上第一个恶鬼。

That period was Japan's Heian era.

那个时期正是日本的**平安时代** (Heian era: 日本历史时期，794-1185年)。

It coincides with when ancient texts began recording people being eaten by demons.

这与古籍开始记载人类被恶鬼吞食的时间点不谋而合。

At the very beginning, people believed in demons, but there was no concept of demon slaying.

最初，人们相信有恶鬼的存在，但并没有“斩鬼”的概念。

Because they didn't even know what a demon truly was.

因为他们甚至不清楚恶鬼究竟是什么。

Demons symbolize humanity's helplessness when facing unknown forces.

恶鬼象征着人类面对未知力量时的无助。

At that time, onmyoji could only teach people how to avoid demons, but they couldn't actually exorcise or kill demons.

那时，**阴阳师** (Onmyoji: 古代日本负责占卜、祭祀的官员) 只能教导人们如何规避恶鬼，却无法真正驱魔或斩杀恶鬼。

They were more like weather forecasters, informing people that disaster was coming but unable to stop the disaster.

他们更像是天气预报员，告知人们灾难将至，却无力阻止灾难的发生。

In the final battle of Infinity Castle, Muzan said the following to Tanjiro: What Muzan symbolizes is a destructive force beyond human comprehension.

在无限城的最终决战中，无惨对炭治郎说了这样一番话：无惨所象征的，是一种超越人类理解的破坏力量。

Like natural disasters, viruses, plagues, people cannot avoid it nor easily trace its origin.

如同自然灾害、病毒、瘟疫，人们无法规避，也难以追溯其起源。

However, up until the 14th century Muromachi period, Japanese demons were no longer just unknown entities, but began to appear in various forms.

然而，直到14世纪的**室町时代** (Muromachi period: 日本历史时期，1336-1573年)，日本的恶鬼不再仅仅是未知的存在，而是开始以各种具体形式出现。

And also began to develop demon-slaying stories that humans could confront.

并且也开始发展出人类可以对抗的斩鬼故事。

In the three battles of Infinity Castle, they happen to each answer the question of what a demon is.

在无限城的三场战斗中，它们恰好各自回答了“恶鬼是什么”这个问题。

### 蝴蝶忍的愤怒与女性的反抗

In the first battle, Butterfly Ninja faces Douma.

在第一场战斗中，蝴蝶忍对战童磨。

Butterfly Ninja discovers that Douma is actually the enemy who killed her sister.

蝴蝶忍发现童磨正是杀害她姐姐的仇人。

Her sister, before dying, told her not to avenge her.

她的姐姐在临死前告诉她，不要为自己报仇。

She hoped Butterfly Ninja could have happiness like an ordinary girl, live until she becomes an old woman.

她希望蝴蝶忍能像一个普通女孩一样获得幸福，活到老去。

But why specifically emphasize “like a girl” achieving happiness?

但为什么特别强调“像女孩一样”获得幸福呢？

Because in ancient Japan, men could directly seek revenge, but women were bound by family and husbands.

因为在古代日本，男性可以直接寻仇报复，但女性却受制于家庭和丈夫。

They had to endure and could not directly take revenge on outsiders.

她们必须忍耐，不能直接向外人复仇。

These unresolved grudges eventually become vengeful spirits.

这些未被解决的怨恨，最终会化为复仇的亡灵。

For example, The Tale of Heike tells the story of “**Ujibashi-hime** (宇治桥姬: 日本民间传说中的复仇女鬼)”.

例如，《平家物语》中就讲述了“**宇治桥姬**”的故事。

She was abandoned by her husband, because of resentment she turned into a ghost.

她被丈夫抛弃，因怨恨而化为恶鬼。

The so-called “female ghost,” in fact, it is the repressed anger of a patriarchal society and a hidden ghost story.

所谓的“女鬼”，其实是父权社会下被压抑的愤怒，一个隐晦的鬼故事。

Thus, in the Heian-period novel “**Dai Chuu Nagon Monogatari** (大中纳言物语: 日本平安时代的物语文学作品)” it mentions: “Ghosts and women both possess aspects that humans cannot see”.

因此，在平安时代的物语小说《**大中纳言物语**》中提到：“恶鬼与女人都拥有人类无法看见的一面。”

Japanese female ghosts also have another origin.

日本的女鬼还有另一个起源。

According to legend, when the Japanese emperor conquered frontier regions, he discovered that some places actually had female tribal leaders, queens.

根据传说，当日本天皇征服边境地区时，他发现有些地方竟然有女性部落首领，也就是女王。

If these places were pacified or chose to side with the royal family, they would be praised and named “**wise women** (sakasime) (贤女: 古代日本对有智慧女性的称谓)”.

如果这些地方被平定，或者选择与皇室站在一起，她们就会被赞扬并被称为“**贤女**”。

However, women who defied the emperor’s orders, such as **Goma-hime** (护摩姬: 日本传说中反抗天皇的女性), would be regarded as evil and wayward.

然而，那些违抗天皇命令的女性，例如**护摩姬**，则会被视为邪恶和任性。

In historical records they would be despised as **earth spiders** (土蜘蛛: 日本神话中对不服从朝廷的异族或妖怪的蔑称), considered monsters that must be eliminated.

在历史记载中，她们会被蔑称为**土蜘蛛**，被认为是必须清除的妖怪。

Because the Japanese court did not recognize that women could hold power.

因为日本朝廷不承认女性可以拥有权力。

Even today, some regions in Japan, the locals worship earth spiders.

即使在今天，日本的一些地区，当地人仍然崇拜土蜘蛛。

Here, we see a a contradiction: When outrageous injustice occurs, if women become too angry, too powerful, they will be demonized by those in power as monsters.

在这里，我们看到一个矛盾：当发生离谱的不公时，如果女性变得过于愤怒，过于强大，她们就会被当权者妖魔化为怪物。

But if they suppress their anger too much and harbor deep resentment, women will eventually become monsters themselves.

但如果她们过度压抑愤怒，心怀深重怨恨，女性最终也会变成怪物。

Shinobu the Butterfly is like a being living within this contradiction.

蝴蝶忍就像一个生活在这种矛盾中的存在。

Shinobu has always been suppressing her anger so no one can see it.

蝴蝶忍一直压抑着她的愤怒，不让任何人看到。

Even when facing demons, she always wears a smile.

即使面对恶鬼，她也总是带着微笑。

Only Tanjiro noticed Shinobu has been continually suppressing her anger.

只有炭治郎注意到蝴蝶忍一直在不断压抑着她的愤怒。

Are you angry? You always exude the scent of anger. Even though you always keep a smile.

你生气了吗？你总是散发出愤怒的气味。尽管你总是保持微笑。

That's true. I might have been angry all along. Since my beloved sister was brutally killed by a demon.

确实如此。我可能一直都很愤怒。自从我心爱的姐姐被恶鬼残忍杀害后。

So what should we do with this power of anger?

那么，我们应该如何处理这种愤怒的力量呢？

American civil rights activist **Audre Lorde** (奥德丽·洛德: 美国著名黑人女权主义者、作家和民权活动家) pointed out: Anger actually helps our personal growth.

美国民权活动家**奥德丽·洛德**指出：愤怒实际上有助于我们的个人成长。

Knowing that we have inner strength, being able to use that power to transform society, identifying what oppression exists in society and who the oppressors are.

知道我们拥有内在力量，能够利用这种力量来改变社会，识别社会中存在的压迫以及压迫者是谁。

Shinobu asked the demon about its characteristics before her sister died so that her anger could find the correct target for revenge.

蝴蝶忍在姐姐死前询问恶鬼的特征，这样她的愤怒就能找到正确的复仇目标。

She discovered that Douma was the enemy who killed her sister.

她发现童磨正是杀害她姐姐的仇人。

Anger opened the part that humans cannot see, those injustices hidden by society.

愤怒揭示了人类无法看见的部分，那些被社会隐藏的不公。

### 善逸与阴影的融合：自我成长之路

In the second showdown, we saw another side of the demon.

在第二场对决中，我们看到了恶鬼的另一面。

**Kuyue** (獪岳: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的角色，善逸的师兄) was originally Zenitsu's senior.

**獪岳**原本是善逸的师兄。

Zenitsu regarded him as a role model for learning.

善逸将他视为学习的榜样。

Because both of them are orphans, they had no family to rely on since childhood.

因为他们两人都是孤儿，从小就没有家人可以依靠。

Their starting points are very similar.

他们的起点非常相似。

Grandfather has always treated both of them equally.

爷爷一直对他们两人一视同仁。

He hopes they will both become heirs of the **Thunder Breathing** (雷之呼吸: 《鬼灭之刃》中的一种剑术流派) style.

他希望他们都能成为**雷之呼吸**的继承人。

Because Zenitsu only knows the **First Form: Thunderclap and Flash** (壹之型 霹雳一闪: 雷之呼吸的第一招), but Kuyue has learned other forms, yet he never mastered the First Form.

因为善逸只懂得**壹之型 霹雳一闪**，但獪岳学过其他招式，却从未掌握第一招。

However, the two with similar starting points ultimately took completely opposite paths.

然而，这两个起点相似的人，最终却走向了完全相反的道路。

In the match between Kuyue and Zenitsu, we see the relationship **Jung** (荣格: 瑞士心理学家，分析心理学的创始人) described as “**self and shadow** (自我与阴影: 荣格心理学中的概念，指被压抑的无意识部分)”.

在獪岳和善逸的对决中，我们看到了**荣格**所描述的“**自我与阴影**”的关系。

Jung believes that the parts of self-awareness that are rejected and repressed do not disappear, but instead form shadows in the subconscious, becoming an unknown part of ourselves.

荣格认为，那些被自我意识拒绝和压抑的部分并不会消失，而是会在潜意识中形成阴影，成为我们自身未知的一部分。

The self and the shadow are like twin siblings; they complement each other, yet oppose each other.

自我与阴影就像一对双胞胎兄弟，它们既互补又对立。

When we find someone extremely annoying, it is likely because we project our own shadow onto others.

当我们觉得某个人极度令人讨厌时，很可能是因为我们把自己的阴影投射到了别人身上。

For example, Jung discovered Americans often project their inferior personalities onto Black people and Indigenous peoples, considering them inferior.

例如，荣格发现美国人常常将自己的劣势人格投射到黑人和原住民身上，认为他们是低等的。

It appears as racial discrimination that belittles others, but actually it's projecting one's own inner darkness onto others.

这表现为贬低他人的种族歧视，但实际上是将自己内心的阴暗面投射到了别人身上。

The same, the phenomena of gods and demons are also a projection of shadows.

同样，神与恶鬼的现象也是阴影的投射。

Humans project their idealized perfect image onto others, calling them gods and goddesses.

人类将自己理想化的完美形象投射到他人身上，称他们为神明。

Or projecting the shadows they resist onto others, calling them demons.

或者将他们抗拒的阴影投射到他人身上，称他们为恶鬼。

This explains the hostility between 獪岳 and 善逸, because they see their own shadows in each other, the parts they lack and try to suppress.

这解释了獪岳和善逸之间的敌意，因为他们从彼此身上看到了自己的阴影，那些他们所缺乏并试图压抑的部分。

Zenitsu is kind and knows how to give, but often shows a cowardly side, causing 獪岳 to recall the childhood memories he tried to suppress, the version of himself lacking strength and only running away.

善逸善良且懂得付出，却常常表现出懦弱的一面，这让獪岳回想起他试图压抑的童年记忆，那个缺乏力量只知道逃跑的自己。

獪岳, on the other hand, fears death, is selfish, and only wants to take, as if a box with a hole, never able to be filled.

獪岳则相反，他惧怕死亡，自私自利，只知道索取，仿佛一个有漏洞的盒子，永远无法被填满。

To gain more power, 獪岳 ultimately chose to join the demons, believing that demon power can perfect the Thunder Breathing.

为了获得更多力量，獪岳最终选择加入恶鬼，认为恶鬼的力量能够完善雷之呼吸。

He was originally a senior disciple envied by Zenitsu and considered a model to learn from.

他原本是善逸羡慕并视为学习榜样的师兄。

Now he has become a demon, transforming the Thunder Breathing into a kind of evil demon technique.

现在他变成了恶鬼，将雷之呼吸转化成了一种邪恶的鬼术。

Doesn't this mean that Zenitsu, who also inherits Thunder Breathing, has become a kindred using the same breathing as demons?

这难道不意味着同样继承雷之呼吸的善逸，也变成了使用与恶鬼相同呼吸法的同类吗？

The demon that should have been eradicated by the Demon Slayer Corps suddenly becomes very close, as if it's a duplicate of oneself.

本应被鬼杀队歼灭的恶鬼，突然变得非常亲近，仿佛是自己的一个复制品。

This makes Zenitsu try to deny and suppress this shadow.

这使得善逸试图否认和压抑这个阴影。

Encountering the demon Koyou in the Infinity Castle, it is like meeting one's own shadow in the infinite space of the subconscious.

在无限城中遭遇恶鬼獪岳，就像在潜意识的无限空间里遇见了自己的阴影。

Thus the duel between Zenitsu and Koyou is actually the problem of how the self integrates the shadow.

因此，善逸和獪岳的决斗，实际上是自我如何整合阴影的问题。

In this duel, both are familiar with the Thunder Breathing.

在这场决斗中，两人都熟悉雷之呼吸。

It's as if the same breathing technique is fighting each other within a web.

仿佛是同样的呼吸法在蛛网中相互搏斗。

The opposition between self and shadow becomes an endless conflict.

自我与阴影的对立变成了一场无休止的冲突。

Jung believed that when the opposition between self and shadow is too intense, to transcend this opposition, one must create new symbolic forms in the mental space, to possibly break away from the original conflict pattern.

荣格认为，当自我与阴影的对立过于强烈时，要超越这种对立，就必须在精神空间中创造出新的象征形式，才有可能摆脱原有的冲突模式。

And this is precisely why Zenitsu ultimately triumphs, no longer entangled with the shadow, but creates a form that belongs to himself: Seventh Form: Fire Thunder God.

而这正是善逸最终取胜的原因，他不再纠缠于阴影，而是创造出了一种属于自己的招式：柒之型 火雷神。

Precisely because the "black shadow" of Koyou exists, that allows Zenitsu's newly created Thunder Form to appear particularly "bright," no longer just remains at the level of only knowing the First Form.

正是因为獪岳这个“黑影”的存在，才让善逸新创的雷之型显得格外“明亮”，不再只停留在只懂壹之型的层面。

The shadow is not the opposite of the self, but a presence that lets the self stand out.

阴影并非自我的对立面，而是一个让自我得以突显的存在。

### 猗窝座与被社会排斥的边缘人

And in the third duel, the demon is no longer just an individual shadow, but an existence that society attempts to collectively exclude and suppress.

而在第三场对决中，恶鬼不再仅仅是个体的阴影，而是社会试图集体排斥和压抑的存在。

Yorozaza was born into a poor family.

猗窝座出生在一个贫困家庭。

To treat his father's illness, he had to resort to theft to obtain money.

为了治疗父亲的疾病，他不得不通过偷窃来获取钱财。

Later, after being caught, he was tattooed on his body to mark his crimes.

后来，被捕后，他的身体被纹身以标记罪行。

In classical Japanese literature, there are frequent records of thieves being considered demons.

在古典日本文学中，经常记载小偷被视为恶鬼的现象。

For example, it is said that the two-faced Sukuna with four arms and four legs would rob everywhere.

例如，据说有两张脸、四条手臂、四条腿的宿傩会四处抢劫。

And the prototype of Yorozaza may be the demon **Kidonmaru** (鬼童丸: 日本传说中的妖怪，擅长盗窃和复仇) in the collection "**Kokon Chomonshu** (古今著闻集: 日本镰仓时代的一部佛教故事集)".

而猗窝座的原型，可能就是《**古今著闻集**》中那个恶鬼**鬼童丸**。

It is said that he had teeth from birth, just like Komahachi, who was born with a pair of fangs.

据说他天生就有牙齿，就像生来就有一对獠牙的狛治。

When he grew up, he also sought revenge for his father.

长大后，他也为父亲报仇。

In the end, he was exiled due to his many crimes.

最终，他因罪行累累而被流放。

Similarly, **Upper Moon Four: Half Tengu** (半天狗: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的上弦之肆) also habitually stole in life, later becoming a demon.

同样，**上弦之肆·半天狗**在生前也惯于偷窃，后来成为了恶鬼。

But why were thieves considered demons?

但为什么小偷会被认为是恶鬼呢？

In ancient Japan, people who did not submit to the Emperor were regarded by the court as dark entities.

在古代日本，不服从天皇的人，会被朝廷视为黑暗的存在。

Those in power would dehumanize these people into demons.

当权者会将这些人去人化，把他们描绘成恶鬼。

Thus they could dispatch troops to subjugate them.

这样他们就可以派兵征服他们。

Many stories of slaying monsters and demons were used to reinforce the legitimacy of the samurai class.

许多斩妖除魔的故事被用来强化武士阶级的合法性。

For example, people from Hokkaido were called "**Ezo** (虾夷: 古代日本对北海道及东北地区原住民的称呼)".

例如，北海道的人被称为“**虾夷**”。

Or during World War II, Japanese were referred to by the US military as "**kijuku** (鬼畜: 日本二战时期对敌人的蔑称，意为“魔鬼野兽”)", portraying them as evil demons that threaten the world.

或者在二战期间，日军被美军称为“**鬼畜**”，将其描绘成威胁世界的邪恶恶鬼。

This way we don't need to treat them humanely.

这样我们就无需人道地对待他们。

This is precisely the treatment Koma received during his life.

这正是狛治生前所受到的待遇。

### 鬼杀队：边缘人的集结与“山民”身份

If we compare, we will find that the people in the Demon Slayer Corps, in fact, most of them are also marginalized individuals excluded from society's framework, and they all have tragic pasts.

如果我们进行比较，就会发现鬼杀队中的人，实际上大部分也是被社会框架排斥的边缘人物，他们都有着悲惨的过去。

Tanjiro's family are rural villagers who sell charcoal.

炭治郎的家人是卖炭的乡村村民。

Zenitsu and Inosuke are both abandoned children.

善逸和伊之助都是弃儿。

The **Stone Pillar** (岩柱: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的悲鸣屿行冥) is blind.

**岩柱**是盲人。

Butterfly Ninja, when she was young, saw her sister being killed by Douma.

蝴蝶忍在年幼时亲眼目睹姐姐被童磨杀害。

**Muichiro** (时透无一郎: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的霞柱) lost both parents in his childhood.

**时透无一郎**在童年时期失去双亲。

His older brother was then attacked by demons.

他的哥哥随后被恶鬼袭击。

The Demon Slayer Corps formed by these marginalized people is an underground organization not recognized by the government.

由这些边缘人组成的鬼杀队，是一个不被政府承认的地下组织。

After joining the Demon Slayer Corps, you have to constantly move between mountains and villages.

加入鬼杀队后，你必须不断地在山间和村落之间移动。

This was actually quite unusual in Japan at that time.

这在当时的日本实际上是相当不寻常的。

Ordinary people spend their whole lives living settled lives.

普通人一生都过着定居的生活。

Why do members of the Demon Slayer Corps have to keep moving through the mountains and forests?

为什么鬼杀队的成员必须不断穿梭于山林之间呢？

If demons are symbols of natural disasters and plagues, then wherever demons go, the Demon Slayer Corps must go there to dispel the disaster, to deal with bodies discarded in the mountainous regions.

如果恶鬼是自然灾害和瘟疫的象征，那么无论恶鬼去到哪里，鬼杀队都必须前往那里驱散灾难，处理那些被遗弃在山区的尸体。

This mobile nature suggests that they are like a homeless group roaming the mountains.

这种流动性表明，他们就像一群流浪于山间的无家可归者。

This type of population living in the mountains without household registration is called “**mountain dwellers (サンカ)** (山民: 日本历史上居住在山区、没有户籍的流动人群)”.

这种居住在山区、没有户籍的人群被称为“**山民**”。

According to estimates, during the Meiji period, mountain dwellers numbered at least 200,000.

据估计，在明治时期，山民的人数至少有20万。

Folklorist **Yanagita Kunio** (柳田国男: 日本著名民俗学家) believed that Japan has a type of mountain people living in the hills; they are actually Japan's true indigenous people.

民俗学家**柳田国男**认为，日本有一种居住在山区的山民；他们实际上是日本真正的原住民。

Originally lived on the plains, but were later driven out and moved to the mountains, leading a hunting-and-gathering lifestyle.

他们最初居住在平原，但后来被驱逐，搬到了山区，过着狩猎采集的生活。

This was the inspiration Yanagita Kunio got after reading material on Taiwan's indigenous peoples.

这是柳田国男阅读了台湾原住民的资料后获得的灵感。

The ancient Han–indigenous conflicts that occurred in Taiwan, which caused indigenous people to move to the mountains.

台湾古代发生的汉原冲突，导致原住民迁往山区。

Similar events may have also occurred in ancient Japan.

类似事件可能也发生在古代日本。

When lowland people encountered mountain people, they described them as **yokai** (妖怪: 日本民间传说中的各种神怪) resembling **tengu** (天狗: 日本神话中的一种妖怪), and even believed they possessed supernatural powers beyond those of ordinary humans.

当平地人遇到山民时，他们将山民描述成类似**天狗**的**妖怪**，甚至认为他们拥有超越常人的超自然力量。

This leads us to an interesting conclusion: In the eyes of lowland people, the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons they kill are not separate entities.

这使我们得出一个有趣的结论：在平地人眼中，鬼杀队和他们所杀的恶鬼并非泾渭分明。

Instead they are seen as the same kind of being, both are mountain people who have left lowland society, both are outcasts excluded from social order.

相反，他们被视为同一类存在，都是离开了平地社会的山民，都是被社会秩序排斥的弃儿。

The pairing of Tanjiro and **Nezuko** (祢豆子: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的女主角，炭治郎的妹妹) are people who were almost turned into demons.

炭治郎和**祢豆子**这对兄妹，是差点变成恶鬼的人。

I was lucky enough to keep my human body. If we were unlucky, both of us might have become demons.

我很幸运地保住了人类的身体。如果我们运气不好，我们两个可能都会变成恶鬼。

In the Entertainment District arc, the demon formed by the sibling duo **Jifutarō and Daki** (妓夫太郎和堕姬: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的上弦之陆兄妹), just like the mirror image of Tanjiro and Nezuko, reflecting the fate they could have originally taken.

在游郭篇中，由兄妹组合**妓夫太郎和堕姬**形成的恶鬼，就像炭治郎和祢豆子的镜像，映照出他们原本可能走向的命运。

Thus, the story of Demon Slayer becomes a battle between two groups of outcasts not recognized by society.

因此，《鬼灭之刃》的故事变成了一场不被社会承认的两个边缘人群体之间的战斗。

Both sides share tragic pasts.

双方都拥有悲惨的过去。

Some choose to join the Demon Slayer Corps, but some choose to join the Twelve Kizuki, as if it's the hidden dark side of Japanese history, a history belonging to demons.

有些人选择加入鬼杀队，但有些人则选择加入十二鬼月，仿佛这是日本历史中隐藏的黑暗面，一段属于恶鬼的历史。

### 猗窝座的强者至上论与社会达尔文主义

Wait, so what exactly is a demon?

等等，那么恶鬼到底是什么？

I’ll tell you why you’re missing that final step and can’t reach the highest realm. Because you are human. Because you will age, because you will die. Become a demon then, Kyojuro. In that case, whether it’s a hundred years or two hundred years, you can keep training and become stronger.

我来告诉你，你为什么会缺少那最后一步，无法达到至高之境。因为你是人类。因为你会衰老，因为你会死亡。那就变成恶鬼吧，炼狱杏寿郎。那样的话，无论是百年还是两百年，你都能一直锻炼，变得更强。

In this confrontation with the Flame Pillar Kyojuro, Akaza pointed out the biggest difference between humans and demons.

在与炎柱炼狱杏寿郎的对峙中，猗窝座指出了人类与恶鬼最大的不同。

Humans, unlike demons, don't die.

人类不像恶鬼那样不死。

Demons can have hundreds of years to train, continuously improving their abilities.

恶鬼可以有数百年的时间来训练，不断提升自己的能力。

For Akaza, the duty of the strong is to become stronger.

对猗窝座而言，强者的职责就是变得更强。

And becoming a demon is the ultimate means to become stronger.

而成为恶鬼，就是变得更强的终极手段。

Likewise, before **Kokushibo** (黑死牟: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的上弦之壹) became a demon, he was originally an outstanding swordsman from the Warring States period.

同样，**黑死牟**在成为恶鬼之前，原本是战国时期一位杰出的剑士。

But he felt inferior because he could not defeat his younger brother.

但他因为无法战胜自己的弟弟而感到自卑。

He wanted to become the strongest samurai, he longed to reach the highest level.

他渴望成为最强的武士，渴望达到至高境界。

Thus, he accepted **Muzan** (鬼舞辻无惨: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的最终大反派)'s proposal and became a demon, hoping to become a being that surpasses humanity.

因此，他接受了**无惨**的提议，成为了恶鬼，希望能成为超越人类的存在。

For Akaza and Kokushibo, in order to become stronger, they can even abandon their humanity.

对于猗窝座和黑死牟来说，为了变得更强，他们甚至可以放弃自己的人性。

This strength-first value system reflects the late 19th century, a major challenge faced by Japanese society, which was the need to keep up with the prevailing international values of the time: **Social Darwinism** (社会达尔文主义: 一种将达尔文进化论应用于人类社会的思想，强调适者生存).

这种力量至上的价值观，反映了19世纪末日本社会面临的一大挑战，那就是需要跟上当时盛行的国际价值观：**社会达尔文主义**。

It stems from the ideology of survival struggle promoted by the British philosopher **Spencer** (斯宾塞: 英国哲学家，社会达尔文主义的代表人物).

它源于英国哲学家**斯宾塞**所倡导的生存竞争思想。

Using Darwin's theory of evolution to promote survival of the fittest, the unfit are eliminated.

利用达尔文的进化论来宣扬适者生存，不适者淘汰。

Because that’s how natural law works.

因为这就是自然法则的运作方式。

This is exactly the principle that Yewaza and Black Death believe.

这正是猗窝座和黑死牟所信奉的原则。

Yewaza, if you’re not convinced, then propose a deadly battle to change the rankings.

猗窝座，如果你不服，那就提出死斗，改变排名。

What the winner says is justice.

胜利者说的话就是正义。

Power is the principle.

力量就是原则。

Relations between nations are just an amplified version of relationships between individuals.

国家之间的关系，只是个人之间关系的放大版。

Japan wants to join the ranks of the strong, so it must conquer outward, win the **Russo-Japanese War** (日俄战争: 1904-1905年日本与俄国为争夺朝鲜半岛和中国东北而爆发的战争), colonize Korea and Taiwan, so it won’t be seen as weak or a loser internationally.

日本想要跻身强国之列，就必须对外征服，打赢**日俄战争**，殖民朝鲜和台湾，这样才不会在国际上被视为弱者或失败者。

This philosophy of eliminating the unfit swept Japan in the late 19th century.

这种淘汰不适者的哲学，在19世纪末席卷了日本。

Spence’s work became a bestseller at the time.

斯宾塞的著作在当时成为畅销书。

Japanese intellectuals even debated whether Japanese should intermarry with white people to obtain the blood of a higher race, so they could become stronger and more superior.

日本知识分子甚至争论，日本人是否应该与白人通婚，以获得更高种族的血液，从而变得更强大、更优秀。

Diplomat **Kaneko Kentarō** (金子坚太郎: 日本明治、大正时期的政治家、外交官) and Prime Minister **Itō Hirobumi** (伊藤博文: 日本明治维新后的首任首相) both consulted Spence, hoping to use **eugenics** (优生学: 一种旨在通过选择性繁殖改善人类遗传素质的社会哲学) to turn the Japanese into a dominant race.

外交官**金子坚太郎**和首相**伊藤博文**都曾咨询斯宾塞，希望通过**优生学**将日本人变成一个优势种族。

This is exactly what in Demon Slayer, some people choose to become demons, obtain the blood of a powerful group, and become stronger.

这正是《鬼灭之刃》中，有些人选择成为恶鬼，获得强大群体的血液，变得更强。

Thus, demons become the desire of humans to surpass human abilities.

因此，恶鬼成为了人类超越自身能力的一种渴望。

### 炼狱杏寿郎：生命的短暂之美与强者之责

But in the **Flame Pillar** (炎柱炼狱杏寿郎: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的角色), we see a counter to Akaza’s “the strong are supreme” doctrine.

但在**炎柱炼狱杏寿郎**身上，我们看到了对猗窝座“强者至上”论的反驳。

Decaying, aging, moving toward death. It is the brevity of human life that brings beauty. Precisely because humans age, because humans die, only then are people so lovely, so noble.

衰老、衰败，走向死亡。正是人类生命的短暂，才带来了美丽。正因为人会衰老，正因为人会死亡，人们才如此可爱，如此高贵。

Humans are fleeting and fragile beings.

人类是转瞬即逝、脆弱的存在。

But this is not a flaw of humanity.

但这并非人类的缺陷。

Indeed, because of human finiteness, therefore everyone has someone they must protect.

事实上，正因为人类的有限性，所以每个人都有自己必须保护的人。

The strong have a duty to protect the weak.

强者有责任保护弱者。

The strength of the strong becomes meaningful.

强者的力量才变得有意义。

Helping the weak anytime, anywhere is your duty as someone born strong.

随时随地帮助弱者，是你作为生来强大者的职责。

In the clash with Akaza, the Flame Pillar acted to consider Tanjiro, the weak one, and became distracted during the fight, ultimately losing to Akaza.

在与猗窝座的冲突中，炎柱为了顾及弱小的炭治郎，在战斗中分心，最终败给了猗窝座。

After being wounded, the Flame Pillar could not recover, because he is a flesh-and-blood human.

受伤后，炎柱无法恢复，因为他是血肉之躯。

But Akaza, being a demon, can continuously regenerate, without worrying about birth, aging, illness, or death.

但猗窝座作为恶鬼，可以不断再生，无需担忧生老病死。

### 炭治郎的互助论：人类社会延续的基石

And when fighting Akaza in the Infinity Castle, Tanjiro presented a rebuttal argument different from Kyojuro's.

而在无限城中与猗窝座战斗时，炭治郎提出了一个与炼狱杏寿郎不同的反驳论点。

The strong should support the weak.

强者应该扶持弱者。

Because no one can grow up alone without needing others' care.

因为没有人可以独自长大，不需要别人的照顾。

Everyone is a baby at birth.

每个人出生时都是婴儿。

In the eyes of adults, they are all weak.

在成年人眼中，他们都是弱小的。

They must be cared for by others in order to gradually grow and become strong.

他们必须得到他人的照顾，才能逐渐成长变强。

If we follow Akaza's “survival of the unfit” logic, then we should let all infants fend for themselves.

如果我们遵循猗窝座“优胜劣汰”的逻辑，那么我们就应该让所有婴儿自生自灭。

This would cause human societies to be unable to continue.

这将导致人类社会无法延续。

The reason human societies can continue is because the strong are willing to help the weak.

人类社会之所以能够延续，是因为强者愿意帮助弱者。

Akaza firmly believes in the superiority of the strong, precisely because he has forgotten that when he was vulnerable, he too was someone who needed to be cared for.

猗窝座坚信强者至上，正是因为他忘记了，当他脆弱时，他也曾是需要被照顾的人。

That allowed him to survive to today.

那让他得以存活至今。

His existence is proof that the strong should protect the weak.

他的存在证明了强者应该保护弱者。

Tanjiro's mutual aid theory, in the eyes of modern people, might be seen as too naive, too simple.

炭治郎的互助理论，在现代人看来，或许会觉得过于天真、过于简单。

But in the Taisho era setting of Demon Slayer, it was actually a once-popular social trend.

但在《鬼灭之刃》的大正时代背景下，它实际上曾是一种流行的社会思潮。

Especially in rural areas, mutual aid remains a common traditional virtue.

尤其是在农村地区，互助仍然是一种普遍的传统美德。

The Russian thinker **Lev Mechnikov** (列夫·梅契尼科夫: 俄国社会学家、地理学家和无政府主义者), when he visited Japan in 1874, found that the rural environment was harsh.

俄国思想家**列夫·梅契尼科夫**在1874年访问日本时，发现农村环境恶劣。

Frequent encounters with natural disasters and anomalies, farmers must cooperate to survive together.

频繁遭遇自然灾害和异常情况，农民必须合作才能共同生存。

Otherwise there is only a dead end.

否则只有死路一条。

This scene of mutual aid makes him reconsider another possibility of humanity.

这种互助的景象让他重新思考了人类的另一种可能性。

The progress of human civilization is not about the strong surviving and the weak being eliminated, but building a community of collective mutual aid.

人类文明的进步并非强者生存、弱者淘汰，而是建立一个集体互助的共同体。

Both the strong and the weak can contribute.

强者和弱者都能做出贡献。

Historian **Koshihara Sho** (越原彰: 日本历史学家) calls this Japanese rural spirit “**Cooperatism** (合作主义: 一种强调集体合作和社会互助的社会理论或运动)”.

历史学家**越原彰**将这种日本农村精神称为“**合作主义**”。

Just like **Rintaki Sakonji** (鳞泷左近次: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中炭治郎的师父) said: Although each person is just a small gear in society, but when placed together, they can set the gears of fate in motion.

就像**鳞泷左近次**所说：虽然每个人都只是社会中的一个小齿轮，但当它们被放置在一起时，就能启动命运的齿轮。

Propelling human history forward.

推动人类历史前进。

Every person's life is brief and fragile.

每个人的生命都是短暂而脆弱的。

But even if a single demon hunter dies, the will to slay demons will be passed on to the collective.

但即使一名鬼杀队员死去，斩鬼的意志也会传承给集体。

Allowing this gear system to keep turning.

让这个齿轮系统持续运转。

One does not need to become a demon and can achieve the “eternity” that Muzan dreamed of.

一个人无需变成恶鬼，也能实现无惨所梦想的“永恒”。

Because humanity can pass its will down through generations.

因为人类可以通过世代相传延续其意志。

Humanity's will is eternal.

人类的意志是永恒的。

After Lev Mechnikov returned to Russia, he wrote a book on Japan's cooperatism.

列夫·梅契尼科夫回到俄国后，写了一本关于日本合作主义的书。

Inspiring an entire generation of Russian intellectuals.

启发了整整一代俄国知识分子。

From **Tolstoy** (托尔斯泰: 俄国著名作家、思想家) to the anarchist father **Kropotkin** (克鲁泡特金: 俄国著名无政府主义理论家), all were deeply inspired.

从**托尔斯泰**到无政府主义之父**克鲁泡特金**，都深受启发。

Later, Kropotkin even teamed up with the famous Taishō-era Japanese novelist **Takeo Arishima** (有岛武郎: 日本大正时期著名小说家) They organized a transnational network.

后来，克鲁泡特金甚至与著名的大正时代日本小说家**有岛武郎**合作，他们组织了一个跨国网络。

Practicing this grassroots mutual aid through action to improve the lives of Japanese farmers.

通过行动实践这种草根互助，以改善日本农民的生活。

Arishima Gorō converted his land in Hokkaido into a shared farm, open free to all tenant farmers for cultivation.

有岛武郎将他在北海道的土地改造成一个共享农场，免费开放给所有佃农耕种。

Advocating the union to share all land.

倡导联合起来共享所有土地。

Arishima Gorō wrote the four characters “mutual assistance” on a local monument.

有岛武郎在一座当地纪念碑上写下了“互相扶助”四个大字。

This spirit is precisely the mutual aid theory that Tanjiro believes in.

这种精神正是炭治郎所信奉的互助理论。

### 无我之境：炭治郎的最终解答

etc. But people inevitably distinguish between you and me.

等等。但人们不可避免地会区分你我。

Isn’t this mutual aid theory an overly naive ideal?

难道这种互助理论不是一个过于天真的理想吗？

On this issue, Tanjiro gave us the final answer.

在这个问题上，炭治郎给了我们最终的答案。

The “mutual aid theory” must be paired with the sudden enlightenment of “selflessness”.

“互助理论”必须与“无我”的顿悟相结合。

In the climax of the showdown with Akaza, Tanjiro recalled his father’s words: Control your breathing, close specific bloodlines, breathe with your body.

在与猗窝座决战的高潮时刻，炭治郎回忆起父亲的话：控制你的呼吸，关闭特定的血脉，用你的身体呼吸。

Your mind becomes transparent, you will see the “clear world” and enter a selfless state.

你的心变得透明，你将看到“通透世界”，进入无我之境。

In **Vipassana meditation** (内观禅修: 一种佛教禅修方法，通过观察身心现象来洞察实相), there is a technique called **body scanning** (身体扫描: 内观禅修中的一种技巧，系统地关注身体各部位的感觉).

在**内观禅修**中，有一种被称为**身体扫描**的技巧。

It can lead a person into a similar state.

它可以引导一个人进入类似的状态。

The so-called “inner observation” is to see clearly the nature of reality.

所谓的“内观”，就是清晰地看到实相的本质。

What is the nature of reality?

实相的本质是什么？

It is that the self does not exist.

那就是“自我”并不存在。

We all assume that whatever arises in the mind must be my thoughts and feelings.

我们都假设，心中出现的任何事物都必定是我的思想和感受。

But why do we think the mind is the boundary of the self?

但我们为什么会认为心灵是自我的边界呢？

When we become overly immersed in a movie's plot, we unconsciously place ourselves into the characters, as if the protagonist's emotions are “mine”.

当我们过度沉浸在电影情节中时，我们会不自觉地将自己代入角色，仿佛主角的情绪就是“我的”。

Similarly, our mind is actually like a little inner theater.

同样，我们的心其实就像一个小小的内在剧场。

Many thoughts and feelings aren't actually yours, they just happen to appear in your mind, seeking to capture your attention, making you think they are your own thoughts and feelings.

许多思想和感受并非真正属于你，它们只是碰巧出现在你的心中，试图抓住你的注意力，让你以为它们是自己的思想和感受。

The “body scan” in insight meditation trains people to focus their attention on the breath instead of on thoughts or feelings.

内观禅修中的“身体扫描”训练人们将注意力集中在呼吸上，而不是思想或感受上。

Pay attention to the air of your breathing as it flows freely between the various boundaries of the body.

注意你的呼吸，当它在身体的各个边界之间自由流动时。

Visualize the pain leaving the body with each breath.

想象每一次呼吸都将痛苦带离身体。

This kind of body scan is like the breathing technique in Demon Slayer.

这种身体扫描，就像《鬼灭之刃》中的呼吸法。

Even if pain exists in the body, you can remain indifferent to it and not feel the pain.

即使身体存在疼痛，你也可以对其保持漠然，不感受疼痛。

Because one's own feelings are themselves an illusion.

因为自己的感受本身就是一种幻觉。

The pain is not mine.

痛苦不是我的。

Thus a person can eliminate his own fighting spirit.

因此一个人可以消除自己的斗志。

Because the fighting spirit is not mine.

因为斗志不是我的。

Tanjiro likens this state to a “plant”.

炭治郎将这种状态比作“植物”。

When the mind enters a transparent world, it becomes like a plant.

当心进入通透世界时，它变得像一株植物。

1963, Vietnamese monk **Thich Guangde** (释广德: 越南佛教僧侣，1963年为抗议政府迫害佛教徒而自焚) publicly protested the government's persecution of Buddhists.

1963年，越南僧侣**释广德**公开抗议政府对佛教徒的迫害。

He set himself on fire with gasoline on a Saigon street.

他在西贡街头用汽油自焚。

According to a reporter who witnessed it on site, Thich Guangde did not twitch a single muscle.

据一位在现场目睹的记者描述，释广德没有抽动任何一块肌肉。

He was unusually calm, as if nothing had happened.

他异常平静，仿佛什么都没有发生。

It was as if a plant was sitting there.

就好像一株植物坐在那里。

Perhaps at the moment of his death, like Tanjiro, entered a selfless transparent world.

或许在他临死的那一刻，就像炭治郎一样，进入了一个无我的通透世界。

This selfless realm not only allowed Tanjiro to defeat Akaza, but also let the boundaries between self and others gradually disappear.

这种无我之境，不仅让炭治郎击败了猗窝座，也让自我与他人之间的界限逐渐消失。

You helped me, so you are already a part of me. I will fight in your place.

你帮助了我，所以你已经是我的一部分。我会替你战斗。

Selflessness instead makes one feel a new connection with fellow humans.

无我反而让人与同类之间产生了一种新的联结。

It can be said to be the philosophical foundation of Tanjiro's mutual aid theory.

可以说，它是炭治郎互助理论的哲学基础。

### 恶鬼：重复强迫与被遗忘的记忆

At the end of the Infinity Castle showdown, Tanjiro's theory of mutual aid awakens Akaza's forgotten past.

在无限城对决的最后，炭治郎的互助理论唤醒了猗窝座被遗忘的过去。

When the memories slowly surface, **Rinsetsu** (恋雪: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中猗窝座生前的未婚妻) asks back: Why are you so obsessed with becoming stronger?

当记忆慢慢浮现时，**恋雪**反问：你为什么如此执着于变强？

At that moment, Akaza finally recalls his past memories.

那一刻，猗窝座终于回忆起了他过去的记忆。

In this respect, Akaza is very similar to **Muichiro Tokito** (时透无一郎: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的霞柱).

在这方面，猗窝座与**时透无一郎**非常相似。

Both have lost their past memories, and they hold a belief in the superiority of the strong.

两人都失去了过去的记忆，并且都抱持着强者至上的信念。

Even if you save an immature swordsmith apprentice, it's useless.

即使你救了一个不成熟的刀匠学徒，那也是没用的。

Helping others, in the end, it will also help yourself.

帮助别人，到头来，也会帮助到自己。

It wasn't until Tanjiro emphasized the importance of mutual assistance that Muichiro slowly recalled his past memories.

直到炭治郎强调互助的重要性，时透无一郎才慢慢回忆起他过去的记忆。

When Muichiro was trapped in the **Water Prison bowl** (水之牢笼: 上弦之伍玉壶的血鬼术) by the **jade vessel** (玉壶: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的上弦之伍), when he was on the brink of death, the swordsmith, originally considered weak, instead gave Muichiro more oxygen, allowing him to use his breathing technique again.

当无一郎被**玉壶**的**水之牢笼**困住，濒临死亡时，原本被认为是弱者的刀匠，反而给了无一郎更多氧气，让他得以重新使用呼吸法。

Eventually, Muichiro finally awakened his forgotten memories.

最终，无一郎终于唤醒了他被遗忘的记忆。

It turns out Tanjiro's mutual aid theory is the belief he himself held in his childhood.

原来炭治郎的互助理论，是他自己童年时所持有的信念。

Acting to help others, in the end, it will also help yourself. Dad has said it before.

行助他人之事，到头来，也会帮助到自己。爸爸以前说过。

Similarly, Akaza's desire to become a stronger version of himself, it is to facilitate theft so he can help his seriously ill father.

同样，猗窝座渴望成为更强大的自己，是为了方便偷窃，以便帮助他重病的父亲。

It is also to protect the one he loves.

也是为了保护他所爱的人。

Because he had already promised Ren Xue on the night of the fireworks, he will protect her for a lifetime.

因为他已经在烟花之夜向恋雪承诺过，他会保护她一生。

Akaza wants to become strong, in fact, it is precisely to protect the weak around him.

猗窝座想要变强，事实上，正是为了保护他身边那些弱小的人。

In this way, Akaza is no longer Tanjiro's opposite, and it happens to embody the idea of the strong protecting the weak.

这样一来，猗窝座不再是炭治郎的对立面，反而恰好体现了强者保护弱者的理念。

Just because he forgot why he fights, that leads him to become the opposite of Tanjiro.

仅仅因为他忘记了自己为何而战，这才导致他成为炭治郎的对立面。

This type of memory-losing demon also appears in the “**Natagumo Mountain** (那田蜘蛛山: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的篇章)” arc.

这种失去记忆的恶鬼，在那田蜘蛛山篇中也出现过。

Even after becoming a demon, **Rui** (累: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中的下弦之伍) remains attached to the family bonds from his life.

即使在成为恶鬼之后，**累**仍然执着于生前的家庭羁绊。

He demands that the demons he controls pretend to be his family.

他要求他控制的恶鬼假扮成他的家人。

Yet he himself does not know why he does this.

然而他自己却不知道为什么这样做。

The original desire has been forgotten, yet the subject still enacts this desire.

最初的欲望已被遗忘，但主体仍然在执行这个欲望。

In the examples of Akaza and Rui, we see what psychoanalysis calls the “**repetition compulsion** (重复强迫: 精神分析学中的概念，指个体无意识地重复过去创伤性经验的行为模式)”.

在猗窝座和累的例子中，我们看到了精神分析学中所谓的“**重复强迫**”。

When a person experiences overly stimulating or traumatic events, the past memories cannot enter the conscious system.

当一个人经历过度刺激或创伤性事件时，过去的记忆无法进入意识系统。

The person cannot recall what happened in the past.

这个人无法回忆起过去发生了什么。

Yet the body continuously repeats past behavioral patterns.

然而身体却不断重复过去的行为模式。

Because the memory has not actually disappeared, but is retained in the subconscious, driving the body to constantly repeat the past.

因为记忆并没有真正消失，而是保留在潜意识中，驱使身体不断重复过去。

But I don’t even know what I’m repeating.

但我甚至不知道我在重复什么。

Whenever Akaza recruits strong individuals to join the demons, in fact, it’s just repeating helping my master’s dojo recruit newcomers.

每当猗窝座招募强者加入恶鬼，实际上，那只是重复着帮助师父的道场招募新人的行为。

Whenever Akaza launches a fireworks-like attack, it reenacts the night of fireworks when I made a promise with Renkyu.

每当猗窝座发动烟花般的攻击，那是在重演我与恋雪约定时的烟花之夜。

Whenever Akaza attacks the weak whom I disdain, it repeats the attack on the weak who slipped poison into the dojo that day.

每当猗窝座攻击他所不屑的弱者，那是在重复攻击那天在道场下毒的弱者。

Whenever Akaza uses the Compass perception, it recalls once more the hair accessory on Renkyu’s head.

每当猗窝座使用罗盘感知，那是在再一次回忆恋雪头上的发饰。

Akaza’s Compass can sense everything, but it cannot sense the memories hidden in its own subconscious.

猗窝座的罗盘可以感知一切，但它无法感知隐藏在自己潜意识中的记忆。

### 鬼杀队：一场集体性的精神分析疗程

Thus, the existence of demons takes on a completely different meaning.

因此，恶鬼的存在呈现出完全不同的意义。

Demons are actually people who have lost their memories and keep repeating the past.

恶鬼实际上是失去记忆、不断重复过去的人。

Because their memories have been replaced by **Muzan’s cellular memory** (无惨的细胞记忆: 漫画《鬼灭之刃》中，鬼被无惨的血液改造后，会继承其记忆).

因为他们的记忆被**无惨的细胞记忆**所取代。

When they recall, they see Muzan’s memories, not their own memories.

当他们回忆时，他们看到的是无惨的记忆，而不是自己的记忆。

Demons are no longer beings that must be defeated, but rather existences yearning to alleviate their symptoms and attain redemption.

恶鬼不再是必须被击败的存在，而更是渴望缓解症状并获得救赎的存在。

Tanjiro’s job is not just killing demons.

炭治郎的工作不仅仅是斩杀恶鬼。

It is more like that of a psychoanalyst, helping demons retrieve their memories from when they were alive.

它更像是一位精神分析师，帮助恶鬼找回他们生前的记忆。

Recall the past.

回忆过去。

Express the regrets they never had time to voice while alive.

表达他们生前未及说出口的遗憾。

In the moment of confronting the past, the ghost turned back into a human.

在面对过去的那一刻，恶鬼变回了人类。

The ghost is no longer a being different from humans.

恶鬼不再是与人类不同的存在。

Because anyone could unknowingly become a ghost.

因为任何人都有可能在不知不觉中变成恶鬼。

Only yearning to constantly become stronger, obsessively clinging to a certain path, a certain destination.

只是一味地渴望不断变强，执着于某条道路，某个目的地。

Yet forgetting what they are fighting for, why we have come to today.

却忘记了自己为何而战，为什么会走到今天。

Demon Slayer is like a collective psychoanalysis therapy.

《鬼灭之刃》就像一场集体性的精神分析疗程。

Let the amnesiac modern people recall a hundred years ago the mutual humanity people once possessed.

让失忆的现代人，回忆起一百年前人们曾拥有的互助人性。

That makes the modern society constantly yearning to become richer and stronger.

那让不断渴望变得更富裕、更强大的现代社会。

Before we are about to lose ourselves, able to pause and ask ourselves what it all is for.

在我们即将迷失自我之前，能够停下来问问自己，这一切究竟是为了什么。
