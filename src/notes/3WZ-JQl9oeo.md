### 疯狂的一天：市场在剧烈波动中收涨

好的，大家好。欢迎回到新一期的收盘速递。我们正在直播，今天真是疯狂的一天。不仅是今天，整个星期都非常疯狂。但今天尤其狂野。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live and what a crazy day it has been. Not only a crazy day, but a crazy week. Um, but today has been pretty wild, folks.</p>
</details>

首先，我们有很多头条新闻要谈，有很多事情要讨论。Tom Lee 接受了 CBC 的采访，我们会了解他对当前局势的看法。Steve 大约会在 4:30 上线，我们也会听听他的观点。但总的来说，股市看起来将以绿色收盘。没错，我们似乎将以绿色收盘。过去的24小时相当狂野。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It looks like, first of all, we got a lot of headlines to talk about. We got a lot of stuff to discuss. We had Tom Lee on CBC. We'll get his thoughts on what's going on. Steve will be on at about 4:30 and we'll hear from him. But overall, equities look like they're going to end out green. It looks like we are going to end out green. It has been a pretty wild uh 24 hours.</p>
</details>

主要是因为如果你在凌晨两点半、三点还醒着，你会看到股市急剧下跌。标普500指数一度接近655点。而现在，我们是664点。早上市场波动非常剧烈。我认为标普500指数在红绿之间来回切换了50次，在盘中高点和低点之间也切换了近25次。这可以说是史上最震荡的一天了。而我们最终似乎要上涨0.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Primarily because if you happen to be awake at 2:30, 3:00 a.m., you saw stocks really take a a nose dive. S&P 500 was closer to 655. Right now, we're at 664. In the morning, you really had a bunch of chop. I think we had 50 different um green versus red movements, teetering and tottering on that green or red on the S&P 500. We almost had 25 different intraday highs versus intraday lows. I mean, it's the most choppiest it's ever been. And it looks like we're ending out up 0.5%.</p>
</details>

如果我们最终收于664点，那么本周标普500指数实际上将上涨6%。我们本周开盘于660点，可能会收于664点。所以，即使在所有这些波动中，**VIX**（Volatility Index: 衡量市场波动性的指数，常被称为“恐慌指数”）昨天飙升至25以上收盘，现在已经回落到21.48，下跌了约15%。如果你在23、24左右买了一些VIX的**看跌期权**（Puts: 赋予持有者在特定日期以特定价格卖出资产的权利的金融合约），那么这些交易应该有不错的收益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we do end out at 664 on the S&P 500, we'll actually be up 6% for the week. We started at 660. We might end at 664. So even in the midst of all the volatility, the VIX, which spiked up all the way to 25, closed above 25 yesterday, right now at 2148, down about 15%. If you did buy some puts on the VIX around that 23 24 time frame, those are working out.</p>
</details>

这导致了部分波动性的下降。很多波动性来自地区性银行，也有一部分来自中国。我们有关于这些情况的一些更新。但无论如何，有人可能会说，今天市场全面创造了一个买入机会。如果你买了任何东西，请在聊天中告诉我，你很可能获得了一些上涨动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh that has led to some of this volatility coming down. A lot of that volatility coming from the regional banks. A lot of that volatility coming from China. We have some updates on all that stuff. But nonetheless, one could argue it did create a buying opportunity today across the board. And if you bought anything and let me know in the chat if anyone bought anything, you were likely getting a little bit of momentum.</p>
</details>

Palantir 股价178。Robin Hood 一度跌至125.60，现在是130。Nvidia 跌至179，现在是183。SoFi，我们有一些关于 SoFi 的更新，股价26.69，今天曾跌至26。Grab 一度跌至5.54，当天仍未翻绿，但现在是5.64，所以有所回升。Reddit 当日下跌2%。亚马逊仍在212，一度跌至211。我的意思是，并非所有股票都恢复了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pounder right there 178. Robin Hood got all the way down to 12560. That's at 130. Nvidia got down to 179. That's at 183. SoFi, we got some updates on SoFi. 2669 that got down to 26 today. Grab got all the way to 554. Still not green on the day, but 564. So that is up. read it right there. 2% on the day down. Amazon still down to 212. That got all the way to 211. I mean, not every stock recovered.</p>
</details>

例如，比特币曾跌至103，现在回到106是好事，但并未像几天前那样恢复到110的水平。它当时在110、112。以太坊也一样，仅在3800。Bitmine 一度跌至47。我在49.50买了一点点，真的只是一点点，不多。现在价格是50.81。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin, for example, got to 103. It's nice that it's at 106, but it's not necessarily recovering back into the 110s like it was in a couple days ago. It was at 110, 112. Ethereum, as well, just at 3,800. Bit mine got all the way down to 47. I did buy a little bit at 4,950. Just a little bit. Not a crazy amount. Just a little bit. 4950. Took a little bit of a nibble, but that's it. Uh, and now we're at 50.81.</p>
</details>

看，这东西会跌破45吗？是的。这很大程度上取决于以太坊。我认为以太坊在这里触底了吗？我不知道。但我确实认为3700-3800这个区间可能不会轻易跌破，除非宏观层面发生其他事情。因此，BMR 至少回到了50以上，还算不错。当天仍然是红色的，但只下跌了0.5%，而不是在47的水平。Coinbase 当天收绿。Coreweave 下跌4%，这只股票从129反弹到136，所以比在129时要好，但仍低于140。纳斯达克上涨了约7%。CrowdStrike 当日上涨0.54%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I mean, look, could this thing collapse down below 45? Yes. It would really depend on ETH. Do I think ETH is bottoming here? I don't know. But I do think 37 3,800 is kind of where it's probably going to not necessarily fall through unless you have something else happen in the macro. But, as of as a result of that, you got BMR at least above 50, which is not too bad. Again, still red on the day, but only red by half a percent versus being down at the 47s. Coinbase green on the day. Coreweave down 4%. This one did bounce off 129 at 136. So it's, you know, better than them being at 129, but still down from 140. You got the NASDAQ right there up about 7%. Then you got Crowd Strike, that's a 0.54% on the day.</p>
</details>

### 多空因素交织：地区银行、中美关系与特朗普言论

这真是疯狂的一周，疯狂的一天。Nebas 从110反弹至114，虽然没有回到早上的120，但考虑到曾跌至110，这也不算最差。稀土股当天仍然收红，只有CRML最终转绿。其余的本周和本日都收红。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just a crazy week and a crazy day. Nebas bounced off 110. It's at 114, not at 120 like it was in the morning, but still not the worst given it's at 110. In terms of the rare earths, these stocks still red for the day. CRML is the only one that ended up going green. The rest of them are red for the week, red for the day.</p>
</details>

地区性银行股全部收绿。它们之所以收绿，我必须强调，今天所有公布财报的地区性银行，包括 Truist Financial，都表示其信贷损失准备金比华尔街预期低了约5000万到1亿美元。这对于确保我们国家没有信贷问题来说是个非常好的消息。Key Bank 和 Western Alliance 昨天出现了一些问题，但有人可能会说这些是孤立事件。当然，也许不是。我认为数据还不够充分，但根据我们今天从地区性银行获得的数据来看，情况可能没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regional banks are all green. And the reason regional banks are green, and you know, I can't stress this enough, every single regional bank that reported today, including Truist Financial, said their credit per their their provision for credit losses were lower by about 50 to $100 million than what Wall Street expected, which is really good to make sure we don't have a credit problem in this country. Key Bank and Western Alliance had some issues yesterday, but one could argue that those are isolated issues. Now, maybe they're not. I don't think there's enough data, but based on the data we got from the regional banks today, it might not be the worst thing in the world.</p>
</details>

所以，地区性银行股因为从昨天的恐慌中反弹而全线收绿。而那些从比特币矿商转型为数据中心的公司，几乎全部收红。它们有所恢复，但幅度不大。Farms 几乎没有恢复，它在4.68处反弹，但仍在5美元以下。Iren 至少不在54，现在是60，但仍低于早上的74。当然还有Oklo，这只股票似乎总是绿的。所以Oklo今天依然收绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you got the regionals that are all green because they're kind of rebounding from the fears that we had yesterday. And then the Bitcoin miners turn data centers, those are all red, pretty much all red. I mean, they're recovering a little bit. Farm's not really recovering at all. That one, I mean, it bounced at 468, but still below $5. I ran, at least it's not at 54. It's at 60, but still down from 74 where it was in the morning. Uh, and then Oaklo, of course, this stock is just always green. So Oaklo still green on the day.</p>
</details>

今天就是这样的一天，甚至没有太多解释。你听到了一些特朗普的言论，他与泽连斯基举行了会晤，我们会看一些相关片段。还有地区银行危机，每个人都发表了看法，看起来问题不大。然后早上，关于中国的言论基本上缓和了与中国的紧张局势。甚至特朗普今天早上也谈到中国，明确表示他不会对中国征收100%的关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so it was just one of those days. It was one of those days. There's not even that much explanation for it. You got some quotes from Trump. He had a meeting with Zinsky. We'll watch some clips of that. You have the regional crisis. Everyone gave their thoughts on that. It doesn't look like it's going to be that big of a deal. And then you had Bent in the morning talk about China and basically deescalate the situation with China. Even Trump talked about China this morning and said that he's not going to put 100% tariffs on China. Explicitly. He said that.</p>
</details>

但随后在乌克兰会议的问答环节，他又说他保留在11月1日之前更快实施关税的权利。这几乎就像他现在只是为了获得筹码而放话。这可能不是他真正想做的事。我认为所有这些头条新闻，加上八月和九月市场表现非常好，进入十月后季节性地会出现一些波动，这是在连续两个月大幅上涨后的喘息。现在看来，情况就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then when he was taking Q&A during the Ukraine meeting, he said uh he reserves the right to implement the tariffs quicker than on November 1st. Again, it's almost like he's just saying things now to try to gain leverage. And you know, it might not necessarily be something he actually wants to do, but I think you have all those headlines running around along with the fact that September and August were really good and you're probably going to get a bit of volatility going into October seasonally and after you have those massive runs for two months in a row. They're taking a bit of a breather and it seems like that's what we've got going here.</p>
</details>

### 财报季前瞻：盈利增长是关键

Ra 说：“这种波动性让我更加看涨，因为这只是人为的操纵，试图在创纪录的财报季之前洗掉意志不坚定的投资者。”是的，我认为这是另一个非常合理的论点。我们即将进入财报季，实际上我们已经看到了创纪录的盈利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ra says, "This volatility makes me all the more bullish because it's just manufacturer manipulation trying to shake out the weak hands before record earnings." Yeah, I mean look, that's another argument that I think is very fair. We are going to get into a week. I mean, we've already had record earnings.</p>
</details>

这里有一个非常有趣的数据分享给大家。从2024年至今，标普500指数在价格基础上上涨了0.1%，不是股价，而是市盈率基础上的价格。而实际的盈利增长是11%。所以，市盈率只变动了1%，而盈利的同比增长率，我想大概是从270增长到295，接近11%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's a stat for you guys that's really interesting. The S&P 500 on a price basis is up 0.1% uh over the not not the stock price, but the actual price to earnings basis uh over the past over the past what is this over the past year from 2024. The actual earnings growth is 11%. So, you have a 1% movement on the PE and you have an earnings growth like the actual percentage of the growth year-over-year. I think it's like from 270 to 295 or something closer to 11%.</p>
</details>

因此，标普500指数的扩张并非主要由股价上涨驱动，而是盈利倍数的扩张，因为盈利本身足够好，足以支撑这种扩张。如果这种情况持续到年底，我认为这将非常令人兴奋。我们只需要看第三季度的财报是否能证实这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, all of the expansion on the S&P 500 has not been primarily just the the price of the S&P 500 going up. It really has been earnings multiples expanding because the earnings have been good enough to justify the expansion. And if that continues going into the end of the year, I think that's going to be exciting. That's going to be very, very exciting. We just have to see if that is what we get going to Q3.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普谈乌克兰与普京会晤

BMR现在略微下跌，跌破50。谷歌61，Grab上涨1.28%，Palantir当天持平，特斯拉上涨2.2%，股价438.47。标普500指数再次回到664。这是特朗普今天在与泽连斯基会晤时就乌克兰问题发表的言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BMR right there getting a little bit of a dip right now below 50. You got Google61, Grab 1.28%, pounder going flat on the day and then Tesla 2.2% 43847 on the day. S&P 500 again 664. This is what Trump had to say on Zalinsky and Ukraine during the meeting today.</p>
</details>

>> 我们没有人员损失。美国没有……我们没有人员损失。我们没有花钱。我们为送往欧盟、北约的弹药、导弹和其他一切东西收到了钱，但如果你看看这些国家，情况非常相似。我的意思是，非常相似。我们刚刚与欧盟达成了一项非常公平的贸易协议，得到了我们想要的，我们也与北约达成了一项非常好的协议。你知道，他们为这一切付了钱。但我们参与其中不是为了这个。我们是为了每周拯救成千上万的生命。成千上万的生命。这就是我们参与的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We're not losing people. The United States is not We're not losing people. We're not spending money. We're getting paid for the, you know, ammunition and missiles and everything else that we're sending to the European European Union, but to NATO, but it's very similar if you look at the countries. I mean, it's very similar. And we just made a very fair trade deal with the European Union and what we wanted and we made a very good deal with NATO, too. You know, they pay for all of this. That's not what we're in this for. We're in it to save thousands of lives every week. thousands and thousands of lives. That's why we're in it.</p>
</details>

>> 接着，这是特朗普谈到他与普京会晤时说的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then this is what Trump said about his meeting with Putin.</p>
</details>

>> 待定，但我想说很可能会是一次双边会晤。会是一次双边会晤，但我们会让泽连斯基总统保持联系。两位总统之间有很多宿怨，我这么说并非信口开河。这是一个非常困难的局面。你知道，我们刚刚解决了持续了数千年的战争。我想人们会说，从500年到3000年不等。我曾和一些领导人同处一室，你们也看到了，因为你们当时和我在一起。上周，很多领导人彼此不喜欢，但他们能够和睦相处。这两位领导人彼此不喜欢，我们希望让每个人都感到舒适。所以，无论如何，我们会以三方形式参与，但也可能会分开进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> To be determined, but I would say most likely it's going to be uh a double meeting. It'll be a double meeting, but we will have uh the president Zalinski uh in touch. There's a lot of blood bad blood with the two presidents, and I'm not speaking out of turn when I say it. It's very a very difficult situation. You know, we just settled the war in after thousands of years. I guess people say anywhere from 500 to 3,000 years. And I I was in rooms as you saw because you were with me. A lot of you were with me last week with leaders that didn't like each other, but they were able to get along. Uh these two leaders do not like each other and we want to make it comfortable for everybody. So, one way or the other will be involved in threes, but it may be separated to be.</p>
</details>

>> 这是最后一个片段，特朗普说出了那个词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then this is the last clip right here where uh Trump ended up letting uh letting one of those words out.</p>
</details>

>> 马杜罗提供了他国家的一切，所有的自然资源。他甚至最近用英语给你录了一段信息，提议调解。我们能做些什么来阻止这一切？
>> 他提供了一切。他提供了一切。你说得对。你知道为什么吗？因为他不想跟美国瞎搞。谢谢大家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Maduro offered everything in it in his country, all the natural resources. He even recorded a message to you in English recently uh offering mediation. What could we do in order to stop that?
>> He has offered everything. He's offered everything. You're right. You know why? Because he doesn't want to [ __ ] around with the United States. Thank you, everybody.</p>
</details>

>> 上次特朗普用这个词是在谈论以色列冲突时，他说：“这些家伙根本不知道他们在干什么。”所以你可以看出，这个情况显然让他情绪激动。但总的来说，那场新闻发布会对市场并没有产生太大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The last time Trump used that word was when he was talking about the Israel conflict and he said, "These guys don't know what the f they're doing." So, you could tell that uh this situation is obviously making him passionate. But that overall press conference didn't necessarily have that much of an impact on the market.</p>
</details>

根据他所说的和他回答问题的方式，市场并不太在意。所以总的来说，无论人们今天预期的与特朗普讲话、期权到期等相关的波动事件如何，你确实看到了来回的震荡，但标普500指数看起来仍然会收涨约0.56%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean based on what he said and based on how he answered the questions, markets didn't care that much. So overall, whatever volatile events people expected today in regards to Trump talking, options expiring, etc. I mean, he got the chop back and forth, but you do have the S&P 500 that looks like it still will close up about 0.56% on the day.</p>
</details>

### 季节性因素与市场疲态

这里有另一个需要理解的重要数据，或者说不是数据，而是数据背后的逻辑。我们都听说过，历史上第四季度通常会有4.7%的反弹。我今天听到的一些话让我对此有了新的思考，这可能看涨也可能看跌，取决于你如何解读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another stat that's really important to understand, or maybe not really a stat, but more so the the logic underlying the statistic. All of us have heard that Q4 historically you tend to get a 4.7% rally. A 4.7% rally uh every time you know Q I mean historically Q4 tends to average out almost a 5% gain. Something I heard today kind of kind of made me think about this and I mean this could be bearish or this could be bullish the way you interpret it.</p>
</details>

第四季度表现如此好的原因之一是八月和九月通常表现很差。那么今年发生了什么？八月和九月并没有表现差。这让你不禁思考，第四季度表现好的原因是因为它通常是在糟糕的八、九月之后迎来反弹，然后资金在年底涌入，推动市场创下历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But one of the reasons Q4 tends to be so good is because August and September tend to suck. So what happened this year? August and September didn't suck. And so it makes you wonder a little bit. Okay, the reason Q4 ends to be it tends to be so good is because it it kind of gets a setup from a crappy August and September and then you get a rally into alltime highs and you get all this money piling in towards the end of the year.</p>
</details>

如果历史新高已经达到，或者说我们在历史上本应疲软的两个月里已经非常接近了。有人可能会说，因为我们在四月份经历了30%的回调，所以四月和九月表现强劲。也许第四季度就不必有和过去一样的季节性回报了。归根结底，这取决于盈利增长。我认为这将是根本问题。如果盈利增长无法否认，那么我们很可能会达到那些历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the all-time high has already been hit or really we got close to it in two months where historically it's supposed to be weak. Now, one could argue that because we had that 30% draw down in April, that's why April and September were strong. Maybe Q4 doesn't have to have the same seasonal return that you've had uh in in the past. And really, it comes down to earnings growth. I think that's going to be the fundamental question. If that can't be denied, then we probably will get to those alltime highs.</p>
</details>

但我确实认为市场已经精疲力尽了。真的。我认为加密货币市场精疲力尽，整个市场都精疲力尽了。说到精疲力尽，黄金简直是筋疲力尽。看看今天的黄金，当日低点下跌1.58%。它一度跌破4200，所以还不算在当日最低点。白银下跌了约4%。我认为 Robin Hood 已经精疲力尽，Nebus 也精疲力尽。我认为很多这些股票都已精疲力尽，而这种疲态可能为很多人提供了绝佳的买入机会，或者可能还有更多的疲态会显现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I do think the market's exhausted. I really do. I think crypto's exhausted. The market's exhausted. I mean, speaking of exhausting, gold is freaking exhausted. Take a look at gold today. Lows of the day 1.58%. It actually got below 4200 at one point, so it's not exactly at the lows of the day. Then silver down about 4%. I think Hood is exhausted. I think Nebus is exhausted. I think a lot of these stocks are exhausted and the exhaustion potentially is giving a lot of people a great buying opportunity or you know there might be some more exhaustion left.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，我认为“疲惫”是本周市场的主题，就像“韧性”是过去几周市场的主题一样，这没什么。我不认为这是世界上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless, I think exhaustion is the theme of the market this week just like resiliency was the theme of the market for the past couple of weeks and that's okay. I don't think that's the worst in the world.</p>
</details>

### 焦点个股动态：医药股重挫，SoFi与星巴克迎新进展

HIMS 在哪里？这只股票今天表现相当糟糕。哇，15%。我过去两个小时都没看 HIMS。上次我们看它的时候是54。这真的全是因为CEO抛售股票的事情惹恼了大家吗？不，肯定是因为特朗普关于 Ozenmpic 的言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where is HIMS? This one had a pretty rough day. Wow. 15%. I have not looked at him for the past two hours. Last time we looked at it was at 54. Is this really all because of the CEO selling thing that's pissing people off? No, it has to be because of Trump and what he said about Ozenmpic.</p>
</details>

礼来公司（Eli Lilly）的情况也一样吗？礼来下跌了2%。诺和诺德（Novo Nordisk）下跌了3%。我的意思是，所有在**GLP**（Glucagon-like peptide-1: 一类用于治疗糖尿病和肥胖症的药物）领域的制药公司都在下跌，但Hims简直是崩盘了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is Lily in the same situation? Lily is down 2%. Novo, that's a stale boner. Yeah, that might be a st Novo right here down 3%. I mean, all the pharmaceuticals in that GLP space are down, but Hims is just wrecked. Wrecked.</p>
</details>

我不认为这是因为CEO抛售股票和我们在早上谈到的整个推特争议，但再说一次，这看起来确实不好。可能有些人对此感到不满，但我感觉这不足以解释为什么会出现那样的抛售。英伟达（Nvidia）股价183，今天表现不错，上涨了约1%，这很好。AMD 下跌约0.5%。博通（Broadcom）也下跌了约1.2%，但在340处反弹，还算不错。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I don't think it's because of the CEO selling and the whole Twitter controversy we talked about in the morning, but again, I don't think it's a good look. And you might have some people that are pissed off about it, but I feel like I just don't know if that's enough of a reason for why you're seeing that sell off. Nvidia right there, 183. Nvidia actually being a good performer today, up about 1%, which is nice to see. AMD right there, that's down about half a percent. Broadcom, that also is down about 1.2, but it bounced at 340, which is not too bad.</p>

几条快讯，然后是收盘，再然后我们会听听Tom Lee的看法。SoFi 的国际汇款业务上线了。加入我们等候名单的SoFi会员将开始可以直接从他们的SoFi支票和储蓄账户向墨西哥汇款，未来还将支持更多国家。没有多少银行能让你如此迅速地进行全球汇款。很高兴看到SoFi在即将公布财报的前几天发布了大量新闻稿。

<details>

<p class="english-text">A couple quick headlines, then we got the market close and then we'll hear what we have from Tom Lee. SoFi uh international money uh uh transfers are live. SoFi members who joined our wait list will start gaining access to send money to Mexico directly from their SoFi checkings and savings account with more countries on the way. Uh not many banks allow you to have the ability to send cash that quickly with worldwide money transfers. So it's nice to see SoFi update a ton of different press releases over the past couple of days in anticipation of the earnings that are going to be coming up soon.</p>
</details>

看起来这就是SoFi在下周财报发布前所做的。我认为这也很不错。然后是星巴克（Starbucks）可能考虑出售其中国业务。我认为这是不可避免的。毕竟，中国对星巴克来说是一个巨大的市场，但竞争也异常激烈。所以他们现在正在接受报价，可能以约100亿美元的价格出售中国业务。星巴克当天上涨了约1%。这不会是最坏的主意，但我们得看看最终会如何发展。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And it looks like that's what you got from SoFi as we get into their earnings that is going to be happening next week. So I thought that I thought that was also nice to see. And then Starbucks is potentially thinking of selling off their China business. I thought this was inevitable. I mean at the end of the day, you know, China is a big market for Starbucks, but it's also super competitive in China. So they are taking offers right now to the tune of about 10 billion dollars potentially to sell off that China business. Starbucks up about 1% on the day. wouldn't be the worst idea, but we got to see if that is how this ends up playing out.</p>

是的，也许他们会卖给瑞幸咖啡（Luckin Coffee）。也许他们会这么做。好了，各位。这是一个疯狂的一周，情绪化的一周。但归根结底，如果你是一个投资者，你的资本在市场中复利增长，这才是最重要的。我们大多数人今年迄今的收益仍然很高。我们也会在收盘时计算年初至今的百分比。但无论如何，我们又挺过了一周。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, maybe they sell it to luck and coffee. Maybe that's what they do. All right, folks. There we go. It has been a wild week, emotional week across the board. At the end of the day, if you're an investor and you have capital that is compounding in the markets, that is what matters. And most of us are still up a lot year to date. We'll do year-to- date percentages as well uh at the close. But nonetheless, we survived another week.</p>

好了，标普500指数当天上涨0.5%，报664点。还不错。本周基本上涨了0.5%。英伟达上涨1%，特斯拉上涨2.5%。Palantir 当天持平。Robin Hood 收于130。SoFi 26.58。AMD 232。谷歌253。Grab 收于5.63。Reddit 下跌2%。亚马逊本周遭受重创，收于213。我本周买入了更多亚马逊股票，我们将看看他们的财报表现。Salesforce 下跌1%。Meta 收于716。PayPal 当天实际上涨了2%，在他们稳定币出现300万亿美元的错误后，表现还不错。

Lemonade 今天也上了头条，他们声称将为特斯拉的**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 完全自动驾驶）提供所有保险。有些人认为这是个笑话，有些人则认为这是个很酷的想法。Lemonade 是一家保险公司，我想他们的CEO发推说，他们愿意免费承保所有在Lemonade下的特斯拉FSD行驶里程。我不太完全明白他到底在说什么，但这只股票今天上涨了1.3%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lemonade which Lemonade made some headlines today saying they would license or they would cover all the insurance for Tesla FSD some people thought of it as a joke some people thought of it as a Cool idea.

I don't fully understand exactly what he was saying, but uh that stock right here up 1.3% on the day.</p>
</details>

好了，让我们来看看年初至今的收益。这几周真是疯狂。我年初至今的收益率现在是142.79%。如果你还记得，两周前是208%。所以从208%一路下跌到142%。显然，我也受到了冲击，但在同样的情况下，这仍然是142%的收益。你知道，你不能对此太沮丧，即使相比几周前这是一个难看的下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's do it. Year to dates. Year to dates, what do we got? Year to dates. It has been a wild couple of weeks. My year to date is now 142.79%. 142.79. If you remember two weeks ago, it was at 208%. So that 208 drops all the way down to 142. Obviously, uh, you know, I'm taking it on the chin as well, but in the same context, it's 142%. You know, it's like it's just you can't be that upset about it, even if it's an ugly decline from where it was a couple weeks ago.</p>
</details>

我认为这是很多人现在需要有的心态。是的，我看到很多人仍然有超过40%的收益。Zokold 是160%。Moon 是130%。我看到76%。Investing with Jeremy 177%。Cotis 28%。Muhammad 30%。Shirant 78%。Lee 50%，Daniel 44%，David 111%，Chris Miller 41%，Bobic 107%，Samish 160%。我的意思是，这些收益仍然非常惊人。标普指数是10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's the perspective that a lot of people have to have right here. Yeah, I'm still seeing above 40% for a decent chunk of people. Zokold's at 160. Moon's at 130. I see 76. Investing with Jeremy 177. Cotis 28. Muhammad's at 30. Shirant's at 78. Um, Lee is at 50, Daniel's at 44, David 111, Chris Miller 41, Bobic 107, Samish 160. I mean, dude, these are still phenomenal. The S&P is at 10.</p>
</details>

我知道这不像几周前那么有趣，但我也想说，就像我早上告诉我表弟的那样，当时确实很有趣，但当事情变得那么有趣时，有时也就不那么真实了。有时那也带有一点狂热。我认为过去几周我已经很坦诚了，我说：“看，我喜欢我的投资组合里 Robin Hood 股价在150，但我实际上不认为他们的盈利能支撑到那个水平。但如果市场愿意给一个高估值，那也行，我不会在那个价位买入。”然后它回落到现实水平。事情就是这样。但我不认为看到一些股票稍作喘息是件疯狂的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I know it's not as fun as it was a couple weeks ago, but also, and this I was telling my cousin this in the morning. It's like it was really fun, but when it gets that fun, sometimes it's also not that real. Sometimes that is also a bit euphoric. And you know, I think I've been pretty transparent over the past couple of weeks saying, "Look, I like Robin Hood at 150 for my portfolio, but I don't actually think they put up the earnings to justify getting there yet. But if the street wants to pay a multiple, cool, that's fine. But I'm not going to buy it there." And so it came back down to reality. It is what it is. But I don't think it's crazy to see some of these stocks take a little bit more of a breather.</p>

标普指数年初至今上涨了13.6%。所以，如果你超过了13.6%，基本上是14%，你就做得不错了。大多数人仍然表现出色，对吧？这让我们有了正确的视角。如果你不像世界上99.9%不真正投资的人那样，让你的资产增值超过14%，那么上周上涨200%或300%或80%，现在上涨65%是一回事。是的，这是一个显著的下降，但你仍然以很大的优势跑赢了标普500指数，即使你现在的涨幅不如上周。我认为在这样的日子里，拥有这种视角非常重要。而且，最终回到历史高点也是健康的，因为如果你一直垂直上涨，那么最终的下跌往往会更猛烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P is 10% year to date, I think. So, let me confirm. S&P year to date 13.6. So, if you're beating 13.6, six basically 14%. You are doing okay. George is at 228. Brock's at 161. Christine Miller's at 91. Dman's at 71. I mean, most people are still crushing it, right? And it puts it into perspective. If you are not someone who has compounded your assets above 14%, like 99.9% of the world that doesn't really invest, it it's one thing to be up 200% or 300% last week or 80% last week and now you're up 65%. Yes, that is a meaningful decline, but you've beat the S&P 500 by a delta of a lot if you're still up uh even if you're not as up as much as much as you were last week. And I think that is the perspective that's very important to have on days like this. And it's also healthy to eventually get back to those all-time highs because if you just go straight up in a in a line that's vertical, you know, it tends to be a much more aggressive fall at the end.</p>

### Tom Lee展望：私营信贷风险不改年末上涨趋势

好了，这就是我们周五的情况。让我们听听Tom Lee先生的看法。Steve将在大约25分钟后上线，让我们看看Tom Lee对过去一周发生的一切有什么看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, that's what we got. That's what we got for Friday. Let's listen to Mr. Tom Lee get his thoughts. Steve will be on in about 25 minutes and uh let's see what Tom Lee has to say about everything that has gone on over the past week.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我听了早些时候的节目，我确实认为我更倾向于杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）的阵营，你知道，以及史蒂夫·利斯曼（Steve Liesman）的观点，即**私营信贷**（Private Credit: 指非公开交易的债务融资，通常由非银行机构提供给企业）领域存在不透明性，这是投资者将在一段时间内努力解决的问题。我认为，再加上贸易紧张局势和VIX指数的飙升，是投资者有些谨慎的原因。但我认为这不会改变市场在年底前仍有许多利好因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh well, I I heard the earlier segment, Scott, and I I do think I'm kind of more in the Jamie Diamond camp, you know, that uh the in Steve Leeman's point that there's opacity in private credit and that's the problem that investors are going to grapple with for some time. And I think that along with the trade tensions and you know, the VIX spike is the reason investors are a little cautious. But I I don't think that's going to change that markets still have a lot of tailwinds into year end.</p>
</details>

>> 部分原因在于人工智能，我认为那里的需求正在加速。我们知道投资者手握大量现金，而机构投资者的今年表现非常糟糕。只有22%的人跑赢了基准。所以我认为会有一点追涨行情，而且市场情绪已经转为负面，这总是一个反向买入信号。所以，我认为尽管面临包括政府关门在内的重重忧虑，但这为我们年底前一波相当不错的反弹奠定了基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And part of it is AI is like um I I think demand is accelerating there and we know that investors are sitting on a lot of cash and institutional investors are really having a terrible year. Only 22% are beating the benchmark. So I think there's a bit of a chase and then sentiment has flipped negative which is always a contrarian buy signal. So, you know, I think despite this mounting wall of worries, including the shutdown, I think it sets us up for a pretty good rally into the end of the year.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我的意思是，斯科特，我唯一不知道的是，这需要多少个章节才能演完。因为，你知道，存在不透明性，这是吓到人们的地方，但还有真正的信贷恶化，我不认为那是正在发生的事情。我认为这就是为什么亚当和所有那些人都称之为特异性事件。我有点倾向于那个阵营，因为高收益债券的利差表现良好。所以我认为这更多的是资本流动的问题，因为我认为另类投资中最大的配置之一就是私人信贷。这会让投资者停下来思考，也许这个市场并不像看起来那么容易获得回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, Scott, that might the only thing that I don't know um is how many chapters it's going to take to play out because, you know, I mean, there's that, you know, there's opacity, which is what is scaring people, but then there's real credit deterioration, which I don't think that that's what's happening. And I think that's why uh Adam and all those had called it idiosyncratic. I'm kind of in that camp because high yield spreads have behaved. So I think it's more of a is the flow of capital because I think one of the biggest sort of allocations for alternatives has been private credit. It's going to make investors pause that you know maybe this market is it's not as easy a return as it looks.</p>
</details>

>> 斯科特，我的意思是，5%只是从1950年到2024年第四季度的平均水平。但我们在经历了长时间的暂停后，美联储正在放松政策。所以那是1998年和2024年。所以我认为5%可能是基本情况。我敢打赌，最终可能会达到7%或8%，甚至可能10%。所以我认为7000点……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Scott? I mean, 5% is just an average fourth quarter from 1950 to 2024. Um, but we have the Fed easing after an extended pause. So that's 1998 and 2024. So I I think that 5% might be the base case. I I I bet you it's going to end up being more like 7 or 8% or even possibly 10%. So I think 7,000</p>
</details>

>> 也就是 Tom Lee 仍然认为到年底我们会超过7000点，如果从现在开始有10%的回报，那将是显著高于7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> aka Tom Lee still thinks we're above 7,000 by I mean meaningfully above if we get a 10% return from here by the end of the year.</p>
</details>

>> 是我们今年可能结束的最低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Is the low of what we can end the year at.</p>
</details>

>> 盈利会很重要，但这是一个好的开始。我们才刚刚进入财报季。银行的业绩一直很好。82%的公司超出了预期。需求的可预见性更高了，对关税的担忧也减少了，因为我们正在逐步解决这个问题。所以公司对未来12个月有了更好的可见性。我认为前景会很好，这将有助于股市。而且我认为市盈率仍有很大的扩张空间。所以，我不认为这个市场要求很高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh I mean earnings are going to matter but you know this it's been a good start. I mean we're barely into earnings season. The banks have been good. 82% of companies are beating. There's a lot more visibility of demand and then less concerns about tariffs because we're kind of working our way through it. So companies have a better sort of visibility over the next 12 months. I think the outlooks are going to be good and and I think that's going to help stocks and you know I I think there's a lot of room for multiples to still expand. So, I I don't think this market's that demanding.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，斯科特，你知道，我知道人们对2023年有很多肌肉记忆，那是因为利率发生了巨大变化，确实让很多银行在商业模式上措手不及。这并不意味着这次的危机，也就是承销是否做得恰当，应该有同样的问题。所以我认为，在地区性银行和小盘股上，存在着“把孩子和洗澡水一起倒掉”的情况。所以是的，我认为尽管罗素指数本周表现不佳，但我认为它们将真正成为受益者之一。即使从盈利基础上看，小盘股的盈利在第三季度将增长48%，这比标普指数大四到五倍。所以我认为那里还有很大的增长空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I mean, Scott, you know, I know there's a lot of uh muscle memory for people from 2023 and u and that was because of of a big change in rates that really caught a lot of banks offsite just in their business model. The that that doesn't mean that this crisis, which is really is underwriting being done properly, um should have the same issue. So I I think that there has been a throw the baby with the bathwater out on the regional banks and the small cap. So yes, I I think despite the fact that the Russell had a rough week, I think they're really going to be one of the beneficiaries. I mean, even on earnings basis, small cap earnings are going to grow 48%. In the third quarter, that's like four times five times bigger than the S&P. So I think there's still a lot of growth left there.</p>
</details>

所以 Tom 仍然在力挺 IWM 和 KRE。IWM 是小盘股，KRE 是地区性银行。现在 KRE 实际上是 IWM 的一个重要组成部分，这就是为什么 IWM 在过去几天受到打击，因为 KRE 受到了冲击。但 Tom 说不存在信贷问题，或者他不一定这么说。他说信贷问题可能不像人们想象的那么结构化。根据今天地区性银行板块公布财报的公司来看，对他来说这是逢低买入的机会，而且问题可能仅限于几家不同的银行。如果情况如此，那么考虑到它们可能带来的盈利增长，地区性银行和小盘股确实可能提供更具不对称性的上行机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Tom still banging the table on IWM and KRE. IWM being small caps, KRE being regional banks. Now KRE is actually a big part of IWM, which is why IWM has taken a hit over the past couple of days because KRE got hit. But uh Tom's saying there's not a credit problem or he's he's not necessarily saying that. He's saying there might not be as structural of a credit problem as people think. And based on the a couple different banks. And if that is the case, then maybe regionals do present a more asymmetric upside opportunity along with small caps given the earnings growth they could deliver against the S&P.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为有几个因素。一是上周有一次大规模的去杠杆化，因为VIX指数的飙升和关税的头条新闻引发了加密货币历史上最大规模的清算和去杠杆化。所以我认为人们还在舔舐伤口。而且我认为也有一点对黄金的嫉妒，因为如你所知，黄金今年的表现非常出色。事实上，你知道，有人排队买黄金。所以我认为有一点“我宁愿拥有黄金也不愿拥有加密货币”的情绪。所以我认为这并不是加密货币周期的顶部，但我认为加密货币的杠杆多头接近历史低点。所以我认为我们更像是处于底部，正在努力回升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I think there's a couple of things. One is there was a big deleveraging last week because that VIX spike and the tariff headlines triggered the biggest liquidation and deleveraging in crypto ever in history. So I think that people are still licking their wounds. And I think that there's also a bit of gold envy because as you know gold has been a huge performer this year. Um in fact you know there's people waiting in line to buy gold. So I I think that there is a bit of like I'd rather own gold than crypto. So I I think this is not the the top of the crypto cycle, but I think leveraging I mean leverage longs in crypto are near record lows. So I think it's kind of like more the we're at the basement and working our way back up.</p>
</details>

### 嘉宾对谈：当前市场情绪与投资策略

看，Tom 的论点和他过去几个月一直提出的一样。我不认为他说的有任何过分之处。我们早上在他发推文时也讨论过。如果我们试图从第一性原理出发思考，现实地看，本周股市下跌的主要原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So I mean look, same argument that Tom has been making for the past couple of months now. Look, I I I I don't think he's saying anything egregious by any sense of the imagination. And we talked about this when he tweeted it in the morning. Like, if we're trying to think from first principles, like realistically from first principles, what is the major reason the stock market took a dip this week?</p>
</details>

我把它归结为 Tom Lee 所说的，市场有点疲惫，想喘口气。中国的事情，也许在认知层面上是个问题，但实际上不是问题，因为中国说他们不想与美国脱钩，美国也不想与中国脱钩。他上周谈到的加密货币去杠杆化，实际上是比特币和以太坊可能下跌的原因。我不认为是人们不再相信比特币和以太坊，只是在不到24小时内有200亿美元被清算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I I chalk it up to what Tom Lee says, which is markets are a bit exhausted and they wanted to take a breather. The China stuff, maybe that's an issue on a perception basis, not really an issue because China says they don't want to decouple from the US. US doesn't want to decouple with China deleveraging what he talked about last week in crypto. That's actually the reason why Bitcoin and Ethereum are probably down. I I I don't think it's people stopped believing in Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's just that 20 billion dollars got liquidated in the span of less than 24 hours.</p>
</details>

你可能有一些人现在有点害怕重新入场。这种情况很可能会随着时间改变，但这可能是压低加密货币市场的原因。杰米·戴蒙一直在谈论的私营信贷的“蟑螂”恐慌可能不像人们想象的那么结构化。然后我过去几周分享了多个图表，显示十月是一年中最波动的月份之一，尤其是在九月和八月对我们如此友好之后，你会遇到一些疲软。当像 Oklo 这样的股票无缘无故地每天上涨5%时，是的，可能会有一点回调。我不认为这是世界上最糟糕的事情。这是一种波动性洗盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, you probably got some people that are a little bit scared to get back in it right now. And that will likely change over time, but that could be what's depressing crypto markets. The cockroach fears from private credit that JB Diamond has been talking about might not be as structur structural as people think. And then I've shared multiple charts over the past couple of weeks around October being one of the most volatile months of the year, especially after September and August have been so good to us that you're going to get a bit of weakness. And when you have an oak low running up 5% every day for no reason, like yeah, probably is going to get a little bit of a pullback. And I don't think that's the worst thing in the world. It's a volatility shakeout. A bit of a volatility shakeout.</p>

Amit：是的，我有点同意Tom的看法。我能理解人们的想法。但这很有趣，因为你感觉自己……我不知道。我一直对加密货币会达到某种高峰持谨慎态度。我不认为我们已经到了那个地步。所以在这方面我同意Tom的看法，但与此同时，你看到加密货币市场情绪低落，但同时你仍然看到很多人想涌入像BMR之类的东西。我认为从长远来看，这些都是很好的机会。我个人是置身事外，因为我确实认为我们正在进入加密货币牛市周期的后端。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah, that's fun. Very good. Yeah, man. It's It's crazy. Uh I'm I'm kind of with Tom, man. I I can kind of understand where people are coming from. It's so interesting though because you feel like you're on the I don't know. I've been cautious about we're going to hit some sort of peak in crypto. I don't think we're there. So, I'm with Tom in that respect, but at the same time, you're seeing this low sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, but at the same time, you're still seeing so many people wanting to pile into things like BMR and and things alike. And and I think that those would be great opportunities long term. I I personally am am staying out because I do think we're entering kind of the the back end of of sort of a a crypto um crypto cycle, bullish cycle, I mean.</p>
</details>

Amit：好的。那么你对我们过去一周看到的震荡有什么总体看法？上周五我们下跌了3%，周一几乎全部收复，现在我们又全部回吐了。加密货币市场……你对我们失去动力的合理解释是什么？你认为失去动力会阻止第四季度的反弹吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So what are your overall thoughts on the choppiness that we've seen over the past week? So last Friday we took a 3% draw down. We recovered pretty much all of it by Monday. I mean we're less than 0.5% away and now we gave it all back. I mean how is the crypto markets what is your rationalization for why we lost that momentum and do you think the loss of that momentum stops a Q4 rally towards?</p>
</details>

Matt Money：我认为进入第四季度仍然会有很多动力，但我认为在一些没有收入的公司里，轻松赚钱的阶段已经过去了，我认为人们需要谨慎。这是我几周来在《Cash Flow Chronicles》中一直在谈论的事情。我很高兴人们在赚钱，我理解人们的处境。我认为我们处于一个非常相似的位置。不完全等同于2021年，但在很多方面很可比，有很多很酷的公司正在涌现，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that there's still going to be a lot of momentum going into the fourth quarter, but I think where the easy money has been made in some of these nonrevenue producing companies, I think people need to be cautious. Uh, and and that's been something I've been talking about in Cash Flow Chronicles for a couple of weeks now. You know, I'm I'm I'm happy that people making money and I I understand where people are at. I think we're in a very similar place. Not exactly analogous to 2021, but very comparable in the respect that there's a lot of cool companies that are coming out, right?</p>
</details>

我觉得你在核能、量子计算和其他一些领域会看到很多类似的情况。这并不是说它们是坏公司。其中一些公司最终会像Palantir一样。它们会像凤凰一样浴火重生，最终实现巨大的市值，并超越今天的估值。但我认为不幸的是，有很多公司只是在搭乘这股势头，而它们并不值得。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I feel like you're going to see a lot of that in Nuclear, Quantum, and a few others. It's not to say that they're bad companies.

They'll be a phoenix that rises through um on the other side and and eventually does come out with uh with great market cap realization and and ends up growing beyond what where their valuations are even today. But I think that there's unfortunately a lot of companies out there that are just riding onto the momentum that just don't warrant it.</p>

### 深入探讨：AI资本支出与亚马逊的长期价值

Amit：Nvidia和台积电刚刚在台积电的亚利桑那工厂推出了首款美国制造的Blackwell芯片。看到这个消息确实非常令人兴奋。这是来自Axiovidia的黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）说的，他称之为“在美国本土建立世界人工智能工厂的开始”。这是黄仁勋的官方引述。所以很高兴看到一些美国半导体生态系统的制造在美国进行。Matt，你对这个人工智能**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）的论点有什么看法？OpenAI与AMD和博通合作，以及Nvidia和台积电的财报？你认为这有点太激进了，还是认为资本支出不会放缓？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Nvidia and TSM just unveiled the first US-made Blackwell chip at TSMC's Arizona's plant. That's actually very exciting to see. That's from Axiovidia's Jensen Huang called it the start of building the world's AI factories right here in America. That's an official quote by Jensen. So very nice to see some American manufacturing for the semiconductor ecosystem happening in America. Matt, what are your thoughts about this AI capex thesis open AI with AMD and Broadcom and Nvidia TSM earnings? I mean do you think this is a little too aggressive or do you think capex is not slowing down?</p>
</details>

Matt Money：嗯，这里情况有点复杂。因为如果你看看股票回购和许多这些公司的运营现金流总额，它们的空间开始耗尽了。如果你看到很多这些公司在过去5到10年里能够在资产负债表上增加如此多的现金，因为它们是利润率非常高的业务。像谷歌这样的公司一直在进行600亿、700亿美元的股票回购，而他们每年的运营现金流有一千多亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh this is where it gets a little bit boggy. uh because if you look at the share buybacks and you look at the total cash flow from operations from a lot of these companies, they're starting to run out of headroom. So if you saw where a lot of these companies were able to add so much cash to the balance sheet over the past 5 to 10 years because they're just such great margin businesses they a lot of these companies like the Googles of the world have been doing 60 billion7 billion share buybacks and they're making a hundred and some billion dollars a year in in cash flow from operations.</p>
</details>

所以他们能够持续增长他们的资本支出，甚至可能开始分红，比如谷歌。现在他们开始说，好吧，你现在有点达到顶峰了。你不能永远扩大你的股票回购。你不能永远扩大你的资本支出。你不能永远扩大你的股息。现在你也无法食言，对吧？想象一下谷歌明年出来说，实际上，我们今年只做500亿的回购。人们会说，这到底是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they've continued to be able to grow their capex capex capex and and and potentially even start dividends in the case of say Google. And now they're starting to say, okay, well, you're kind of hitting a peak now. You can't expand your share buybacks forever. You can't expand your capex forever. You can't expand your dividends forever. And now you can't go back on your word either, right? I mean, imagine Google coming out next year and being like, actually, we're only going to do 50 billion in buybacks this year. People are going to be like, what the hell's going on? Right?</p>
</details>

所以我觉得很多公司不幸地把自己逼到了一个角落。我不认为你会看到资本支出的大规模削减，但你可能会看到增长速度的放缓，特别是在那个领域的增长速度。所以，这并不是说像英伟达这样的公司会突然出现50%的收入下降之类的情况，但你不会看到……我认为部分是因为大数法则，其次是因为我认为人们的运营现金流中用于持续以过去两三年那样的增长率扩张的额外预算已经用完了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there I feel like a lot of companies unfortunately are are kind of putting themselves in a corner. Uh I don't like I said I don't think that you're going to see this massive capital expenditure cut but you might see a slowdown particularly on how much growth is happening in that area. So, it's not to say that the Nvidia of the world are going to massively just like hit a 50% sort of revenue decrease or anything like that, but you're not going to see I don't think just one partly because of the rule of large numbers and then two because I think people are running out of the additional budget within their cash flow from operations to continuously expand at the growth rates that we've had over the past say two to three years.</p>
</details>

Amit：说到七巨头，Matt，跟我谈谈这个名字，因为我最近才开始投资它。你买亚马逊已经好多年了，我敢肯定你在这只股票上有很重的仓位。你目前对亚马逊这只股票的走势有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, speaking of the Mac 7, Matt, talk to me about this name because I recently got into it. You've been buying Amazon for god knows how many years, and I'm pretty sure you have a pretty heavy position in this name. What are your current thoughts on the trajectory of Amazon, the stock?</p>
</details>

Matt Money：是的，Steve和我不时聊过这个。我想我们都同意。我想你在最近的一次市场收盘节目中提到过。亚马逊将在未来五年内成为一家万亿美元收入的公司。所以这就像，好吧，这有点像为什么不买一些必然会发生的事情，对吧？如果你想确保你在市场上赚钱，并且你有这样的机会，你可以把钱放在一个安全的地方，为什么不把它放在像亚马逊这样的地方，你知道它是安全的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean Steve and I have chatted about this on and off. I think we both are in agreement. Uh I think you me mentioned it on a previous market close recently. Amazon will be a trillion dollar revenue company within the next five years. And so it's like okay, it's kind of like just why buy something that's inev why not buy something that's inevitable, right? If you want to make sure that you're going to be making money in the market and you have a a kind of opportunity like this and you can kind of put somewhere money somewhere safe, why not put it in something like an Amazon where you know uh that it's going to be safe.</p>
</details>

它的市值不到2.5万亿美元。它产生的实际现金流几乎和谷歌一样多。而谷歌的市值实际上比亚马逊高出20%。但我认为亚马逊之所以受到冲击，是因为有太多的基础设施，太多的仓储等等，不幸的是，当你从每股收益（EPS）的角度看，你会看到大量的折旧被计入其中。你必须折旧你的仓库，你必须折旧所有的车辆，你必须折旧。所以当你从EPS的角度看，净收入实际上受到了很大的冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's less than a $2 half trillion dollar market cap. It makes almost about as much in terms of actual cash flow as Google. And so Google's actually priced I think 20% higher in terms of a market capitalization of Amazon. But the reason why I think Amazon takes a hit is because there's so much infrastructure there's so much warehousing etc that there's unfortunately when you look at the EPS on a gap basis you have a lot of depreciation that gets fed into that you have to depreciate your warehouses you have to appreciate all the vehicles you have to depreciate and so when it looks when you look at it on an EPS basis you're actually having a pretty big hit in terms of the actual net income and so</p>
</details>

如果你从现金流的角度看，它的估值真的应该更接近谷歌的估值。不仅如此，如果你想一想，如果这家公司真的要成为一个万亿美元收入的企业，那么在未来大约10年左右，它没有理由不成为一个10万亿美元的公司。考虑到他们在AWS业务中获得的利润率，他们在AWS业务中持续的增长，他们现在实际上是美国以及欧洲和其他地方人们购物的主要基础设施，如果他们能够真正专注于提高利润率，它实际上开始赚钱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you look at it on a cash flow basis it really should be valued closer up to to what uh Google's valued at. And not only that, but if you think about it, if this company really is going to be a trillion dollar revenue business, there's really no reason why eventually in the next probably 10 years or so, it shouldn't be a 10 trillion dollar company. just with respect to the margins that they're getting in their AWS business, the continued growth they're getting in their AWS business, they're actually now that they're really the the main infrastructure of really how people shop in the United States and also abroad in Europe and and other places. It's actually starting to generate money if they're able to really hone in and get those margins up.</p>
</details>

你想想，在一万亿美元的收入上，利润率提高一两个百分点，就是100到200亿美元的净收入。你给它一个市盈率倍数，比如说10或20倍，你说的就是2000到4000亿美元，这还只是一两个百分点的利润率增长，甚至还没包括顶线的潜在增长。所以你开始思考这些事情，对我来说，很容易看出亚马逊最终会成为一家10万亿美元的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You think about one or two percent um on a trillion dollars of just margin improvement is 10 to 20 billion dollars in net income to the bottom line. You throw you throw a multiple on that right of you know let's just say 10 or 20 uh times you're talking about 200 to400 billion and that's just a one or two percentage increase on margins and that's not even including potential growth on the top line. So you start to think about some of these things um and it's easy to see for me that Amazon will eventually be a $10 trillion company.</p>

### 科技前沿：英伟达国产芯片与Anduril的未来科技

Steve：我得告诉你，他们正在建造的东西令人难以置信。如果这家公司很快上市，它会比洛克希德·马丁更大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I gotta tell you what they're building is incredible. And if this company goes public anytime soon, I got it's gonna be bigger than LED.</p>

Amit：你刚才说 Led 吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Did you just say Led?</p>
</details>

Steve：它会比他们更大。它会比波音更大。我的意思是，这可能会成为一家半万亿美元的公司。我甚至不知道该说什么。那东西太疯狂了。简直是《使命召唤》里的玩意儿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Been a long day. Um, it'll be bigger than them. It would be bigger than Boeing. I mean, this will probably be half a trillion dollar company. I I don't even know what to say. That shit's wild. It's some Call of Duty [ __ ]</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，他们会成为军方所有这些新技术的独家供应商。然后当你加上，你知道，他们正在与Palantir合作。我的意思是，这对Palantir最终将产生巨大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, they're going to get like they're going to be the sole supplier for the military with all this new tech. And then when you add, you know, they're working with Palunteer. I mean, this is going to have huge implications for Palanteer eventually.</p>
</details>

Matt Money：我不知道估值如何。那可能有点难。也许会买一点，只是因为他们在做的事情，我支持它。你知道，有点像Palantir，对吧？我支持这个使命。我支持这个愿景。所以，我的意思是，我觉得在这方面，即使它亏钱，你知道，如果你考虑市值无关紧要，那么我觉得我至少得以某种方式参与进来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't know about regardless of valuation. That might be tough. Um maybe a little just just because of what they're doing and I support it. Um you know, kind of like with Palunteer, right? I support the mission. I support the vision. So, I mean, I feel like in that respect, I feel like even if it loses money, quote unquote, you know, if you're thinking about market cap irrelevancy, then I feel like I have to at least get involved somehow.</p>
</details>

### 尾声：对未来几周财报季的展望

Steve：我想你会看到Azure、AWS和Google Cloud无法满足需求。我想你会看到巨大的资本支出。我想你会看到大量的运营现金流。我想你会看到苹果有一个非常强劲的第一季度。我认为人们低估了iPhone的周期。我认为大型科技公司正在为好事情做准备。我真的这么认为。而且我认为英伟达会出来说他们的净收入达到了300亿美元。你跟不上。不是说他们跟不上需求，而是基本上每一块芯片都有人要了。在看过台积电的报告后，没有理由不对这些公司超级看好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I think that you're going to see Azure AWS and Google Cloud not be able to keep up with demands. I think you're going to see big capex spending. I think you're going to see a lot of cash from operations. I think you're going to see Apple have a very strong Q1. I think people are underestimating the iPhone cycle. I think big tech setting up for good things. I really do. And I think Nvidia is going to come out saying that they hit 30 billion in net income. You can't keep up. Not that they can't keep up with demand, but every chip is basically accounted for. I just I'm not seeing any after the I after going through TSM report. if there's no reason not to be super bullish on those companies.</p>
</details>

Matt Money：我认为谷歌和亚马逊在月底报告，对吧？所以他们大概在29号和30号报告。我认为谷歌可能会有最多的……我不知道，英伟达可能会带来惊喜，但我觉得英伟达现在的位置，他们的利润率不幸地会受到一点冲击，因为他们需要吸引人们花更多的钱。所以我感觉他们将不得不削减一点利润率，使其更实惠。所以我认为谷歌，因为他们的云业务带来的运营利润率扩张，并且与他们其余的业务，你知道，他们的搜索业务和YouTube业务等相比，它的增长速度惊人，我认为这将对他们的底线产生巨大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I think Google and Amazon report at the end of the month, right? So, they report on the 29th and 30th, I believe. Um, I'm I think Google uh will probably have the most uh I don't know, Nvidia might come up with a surprise, but I feel like Nvidia with where they're at now, I think they're unfortunately their margins are going to get hit a little bit because um they need to entice people to spend more. So, I feel like they're going to have to uh to cut margins a little bit to to be able to make it a little bit more affordable. So I think Google because of their operating margin expansion associated with the cloud business and it's growing at such an alarming rate comparatively to the rest of their you know their search business and and YouTube business etc. I think that that's really going to help play a huge impact to their bottom line and so um</p>
</details>

你可能不会看到一个大的顶线增长数字。我仍然认为你会看到云业务超过20%的增长。但作为一个集团，我不认为你会看到20%的增长范围，但我相信因为云业务的巨大扩张性利润率，它将大幅拉高整个集团的净利润率。所以，现在你在过去18到24个月里，云业务的运营现金流已经转正，这真的只是，你知道，尽可能多地获得收入，与亚马逊和微软相比，不是说他们处于糟糕的状况，我只是觉得他们在云领域更成熟，他们的业务已经处于那个周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you might not see a large topline growth number associated with it. I still think you'll see north of 20% growth from cloud. Um, but as a group, I don't think you'll see, you know, in the 20% range, but I believe because of the the uh the large expansive uh margins that you have in the cloud business, it'll drag the net income margin up substantially for the entirety of the group. So, uh, now that you've over the past 18, 24 months really hit ops cashache positive on the cloud business, it's really just, um, you know, getting as much in, uh, revenue as you can versus Amazon and Microsoft, not that they're in bad, uh, you know, bad shape or anything of the like, I just feel like they're they're more mature on the cloud space and their businesses have already kind of been on that cycle.</p>
</details>

Steve：我不知道。我的意思是，我认为英伟达会大获全胜，但我有一个你可能不喜欢的看法。我认为微软会有一个非常棒的季度。我真的这么认为。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I don't know. I mean, I think Nvidia is going to crush, but I I got something that you're not going to like. I think Microsoft's going to have a great freaking quarter. I really do.</p>
</details>

Amit：我认为微软，因为他们开始披露AWS的运行率。这并不容易做到，特别是对于一个从未这样做的公司。我的意思是，他们如此自信地这样做，还有这些初创公司，我不知道你们多关注初创公司的新闻，但今天有一家公司筹集了1.35亿美元的种子轮融资。不是A轮，不是B轮，是种子轮，他们是一家基础模型公司。他们不是与anthropic竞争，但他们是那些基础模型公司之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, look, I think Microsoft because they freaking uh started disclosing AWS run rates. That's not easy to do, especially for a company that never did. I mean, the fact that they were so comfortable doing that and all these dude, some of these startups, I I don't know how much you guys keep up with the startup news, but there was a company today that raised a $135 million seed round. Not series A, not series B, seed round, and they're a foundation model company. They're not competing with like anthropic, but they're one of these foundation model companies that's out there.</p>
</details>

Steve：回到你的观点，关于这些私营公司，当他们从风险投资公司筹集数亿美元时，你猜他们会去哪里？亚马逊、谷歌和微软，来运行他们的人工智能工作负载。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> no, but going back to your point, Steve, on this private stuff, like all these private companies, when they raise hundreds of millions of dollars from VCs, guess where they're going to? Amazon, Google, and Microsoft to run their AI workloads.</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，而且那笔钱实际上正在被花费，因为那是他们筹集的资本。所以这不像虚幻的资本。现在，那些公司是否真的能生存下来是另一回事，但这对于微软来说无关紧要。他们仍然在付钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And that money is get actually getting spent because it's freaking capital they're raising. So, it's not like it's phantom capital. Now, if those companies actually survive is a different story, but that doesn't matter for freaking Microsoft. They're still paying.</p>
