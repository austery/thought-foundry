<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, I'm Nicolola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sover and Wealth Fund and in today we are in really good company with Amanda Blanc, the CEO of Britain's leading insurance company, Aviva.</p>
</details>

安盛是一家为您的房屋、汽车提供保险，并帮助您为退休储蓄的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is the kind of company that ensures your home, your car, and helps you save for retirement.</p>
</details>

他们在全球服务2500万人，仅在英国就服务2100万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They serve 25 million people globally and 21 million people in the UK alone.</p>
</details>

Amanda于2020年7月上任，并领导了一场被描述为“彻底转型”的变革，我们即将详细了解这一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amanda took over in July 2020 and has led what is described as a complete transformation and we're going to hear all about it.</p>
</details>

Amanda，非常高兴您能来到我们的节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so Amanda, wonderful to have you on the broadcast.</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 谢谢Nicolai，很高兴见到您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now thanks Nikolai, really great to see you.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 在我们开始之前，简单介绍一下，安盛（Aviva）究竟是做什么的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just briefly before we start, what does Aviva actually do in short?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 好的，简而言之，我们主要保护人们和企业免受可能发生的坏事影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. In short, well, I mean, basically, it protects people. It protects businesses um from bad things that can happen.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还在人们需要帮助时，以及当他们想要退休时，提供支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also, it looks after people in their hour of need and when they want to do things like retire.</p>
</details>

所以，我们常说“今天与您同行，共创美好明天”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, we we say with you today for a better tomorrow.</p>
</details>

这就是我们的宗旨，我想这概括了我们所做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's our purpose. And I suppose that encapsulates everything that we do.</p>
</details>

### 保险公司与主要投资者的双重角色

**Nicolai Tangen:** 您既是保险公司，也是主要投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you're both an insurer and a major investor.</p>
</details>

您能解释一下这种双重角色吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How could you explain that dual role?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 是的，作为一家保险公司，我们拥有庞大的**资产负债表**（Balance Sheet: 反映公司在特定时间点资产、负债和所有者权益的财务报表），超过4000亿英镑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. So, so obviously um as an insurer we have a big balance sheet so over 400 billion pounds and so we need to put those assets to really really good use and we do that by investing.</p>
</details>

因此，我们需要将这些资产充分利用，我们通过投资来实现这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're a big investor in the UK so you know we're we're a big believer in the UK so we invest in UK infrastructure in UK guilts I mean also in private assets but we also invest in in corporate debt and and in other things.</p>
</details>

我们是英国的重要投资者，坚信英国市场，因此我们投资于英国基础设施、**英国国债**（UK Gilts: 英国政府发行的债券）以及**私募资产**（Private Assets: 不在公开市场交易的资产，如私募股权、房地产等）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's about getting the best return over a very long period for our shareholders and obviously also for our customers.</p>
</details>

我们还投资于公司债券和其他领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's about getting the best return over a very long period for our shareholders and obviously also for our customers.</p>
</details>

我认为这关乎在非常长的时间内为我们的股东和客户获取最佳回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's about getting the best return over a very long period for our shareholders and obviously also for our customers.</p>
</details>

### 安盛的独特之处与转型之路

**Nicolai Tangen:** 将安盛与其他保险公司进行比较，您认为是什么让你们与众不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you compare Aviva with other insurance companies, what is it that make you special?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，对于我们来说，是什么让我们与众不同呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think for for us, what makes us special?</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 当然，除了拥有一位出色的首席执行官之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apart apart, of course, from having a wonderful CEO.</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 哦，不不不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh no, no, no, no.</p>
</details>

但我认为，这确实与为安盛工作的员工有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">But I I mean I think it is about the people that work for Aviva. They make a really big difference.</p>
</details>

他们带来了巨大的不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you think about an insurance company, it doesn't really sell anything tangible like a handbag or a pair of shoes.</p>
</details>

如果您考虑一家保险公司，它实际上并不销售手提包或鞋子之类的有形商品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

它基本上出售的是一个支付的承诺，所以我认为这使我们与众不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

但如果真正思考我们的**独特卖点**（USP: Unique Selling Proposition，指产品或服务独有的、能吸引顾客的特点），那就是我们的多元化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

我们基本上可以从您很小的时候的**青少年个人储蓄账户**（Junior ISA: 英国为儿童提供的免税储蓄和投资账户）开始，一直到您晚年考虑的**房屋净值抵押贷款**（Equity Release Mortgage: 允许老年房主将房屋净值转换为现金的贷款），以及介于两者之间的所有服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

在英国，没有其他保险公司能做到这一点，在全球范围内，现在也很少有保险公司能做到这一点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 您和我在各自的岗位上工作的时间几乎完全相同，都是五年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you and I we've been in the jobs for pretty much exactly the same time 5 years now you've totally transformed Aviva what are the key decisions that you have made</p>
</details>

您彻底改变了安盛，您做出了哪些关键决策？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you and I we've been in the jobs for pretty much exactly the same time 5 years now you've totally transformed Aviva what are the key decisions that you have made</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我认为关键决策实际上是在上任的第一个月内做出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think the key decisions came with actually within the first month so I was in the fortunate position of being on the board for six months before I became the CEO and really the the big decision was around focusing the portfolio if I looked at Aviva and you know we had positions all across the world but we didn't have scale positions and coming from the background of working at for much of my career working with h onre dcast.</p>
</details>

我很幸运，在成为首席执行官之前，已经在董事会任职了六个月。

</details>

真正重要的决定是关于聚焦投资组合。

</details>

当我审视安盛时，我们虽然在全球各地都有业务，但并没有形成规模优势。

<details>

</details>

我职业生涯的大部分时间都在与**Henri de Castries**（法国安盛集团前首席执行官）共事，他的一大信条是，你必须在所处的市场中位列前三，才能产生影响力并获得规模效益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, one of his big mantras was you you need to be top three in the market that you're in in a in order to be able to influence and to get the benefits of scale in that market.</p>
</details>

所以，我们很早就决定聚焦投资组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we took decisions very early on about focusing the portfolio.</p>
</details>

在最初的12到24个月内，我们出售了八项业务，总计80亿英镑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We sold eight businesses for8 billion pounds within the first sort of 12 to 24 months and by doing that we were able to meet our second objective which is about delevering the organization also returning some money to shareholders and actually what was good was by by selling off those businesses where we didn't have scale positions we basically showed the strength of the core business in the UK Ireland and Canada and and all you know all the real benefits of being scale players in our market really started to shine M</p>
</details>

通过这样做，我们实现了第二个目标，即对公司进行**去杠杆化**（Delevering: 减少负债，降低财务杠杆），并向股东返还部分资金。

<details>

<p class="english-text">We sold eight businesses for8 billion pounds within the first sort of 12 to 24 months and by doing that we were able to meet our second objective which is about delevering the organization also returning some money to shareholders and actually what was good was by by selling off those businesses where we didn't have scale positions we basically showed the strength of the core business in the UK Ireland and Canada and and all you know all the real benefits of being scale players in our market really started to shine M</p>
</details>

实际上，通过出售那些我们不具备规模优势的业务，我们展示了在英国、爱尔兰和加拿大核心业务的实力，并真正开始显现出作为市场规模参与者的所有真正优势。

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** Amanda，在您接任首席执行官之前，能在董事会任职六个月，这确实是一种奢侈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amanda, it's quite a luxury to be on the board 6 months before you take over SEO.</p>
</details>

您当时是否拿着一张纸，想着“我要改变这个，我要改变那个”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, were you sitting there with a piece of paper? It's just like I'm going to change this, I'm going to change that.</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 不，不，完全不是那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I mean, no, it it wasn't like it wasn't like that at all.</p>
</details>

我是在2019年12月开始任职的，然后我们很快就进入了疫情时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I started in the December 2019 and um obviously then we went straight into into co and the uh you know we we appointed a new chair and and then you know that the CEO stepped down and so there was a real opportunity and of course as you're sitting on the board you and as a pre and I'd been an executive for a long time before that you're always looking at it with an angle of you know what would I do what could I do differently um and you know I really felt that by making some real decisive decisions around the portfolio that to me was obvious, you know, everything in my DNA was telling me that that was the right thing to do.</p>
</details>

我们任命了一位新的主席，然后首席执行官辞职了，所以这是一个真正的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I started in the December 2019 and um obviously then we went straight into into co and the uh you know we we appointed a new chair and and then you know that the CEO stepped down and so there was a real opportunity and of course as you're sitting on the board you and as a pre and I'd been an executive for a long time before that you're always looking at it with an angle of you know what would I do what could I do differently um and you know I really felt that by making some real decisive decisions around the portfolio that to me was obvious, you know, everything in my DNA was telling me that that was the right thing to do.</p>
</details>

当然，当您作为董事会成员，并且在此之前长期担任高管时，您总是会从“我会怎么做？我能做些什么不同？”的角度来看待问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I started in the December 2019 and um obviously then we went straight into into co and the uh you know we we appointed a new chair and and then you know that the CEO stepped down and so there was a real opportunity and of course as you're sitting on the board you and as a pre and I'd been an executive for a long time before that you're always looking at it with an angle of you know what would I do what could I do differently um and you know I really felt that by making some real decisive decisions around the portfolio that to me was obvious, you know, everything in my DNA was telling me that that was the right thing to do.</p>
</details>

我真的觉得，通过围绕投资组合做出一些真正果断的决定，对我来说是显而易见的，我骨子里的一切都在告诉我那是正确的做法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um so I started in the December 2019 and um obviously then we went straight into into co and the uh you know we we appointed a new chair and and then you know that the CEO stepped down and so there was a real opportunity and of course as you're sitting on the board you and as a pre and I'd been an executive for a long time before that you're always looking at it with an angle of you know what would I do what could I do differently um and you know I really felt that by making some real decisive decisions around the portfolio that to me was obvious, you know, everything in my DNA was telling me that that was the right thing to do.</p>
</details>

然后，您看到了连接所有客户利益的真正机会，我感觉这非常引人注目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you saw the sort of, you know, 20 20 million customers or probably wasn't as many at that point. The real opportunity to sort of connect all of the benefits through the customer proposition and I felt that that was something really compelling, but yet it was it's always very frustrating, isn't it, when you haven't got your hands on something you want to sort of be able to do.</p>
</details>

但当你无法亲自动手做你想做的事情时，总是会感到非常沮丧，不是吗？

</details>

### 转型中的挑战：疫情、文化与投资者信心

**Nicolai Tangen:** 这次转型中最大的挑战是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was the biggest challenge in this transformation?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，**新冠疫情**（COVID: 由新型冠状病毒引起的全球性传染病）是一个巨大的挑战，因为很明显，我当时基本上是在运营一个只有我们几个人在圣海伦斯老办公楼里做决策、使用Teams通话等一切操作的部门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I I mean COVID was a big challenge because obviously you know effectively I was running the operation where there were a few of us in the our old building in St. Helens in in in the city basically you know making making decisions and using teams calls and everything else.</p>
</details>

所以，这既是福也是祸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was a blessing and a curse.</p>
</details>

困难在于我喜欢深入业务，喜欢了解正在发生的事情，但同时，这也意味着你可以真正集中精力，把事情做好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it was difficult in that I like to be out in the business. You like to see what's going on but at the same time it also meant you could really focus your attention. You could really get things done.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为那是一个挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that was a challenge.</p>
</details>

当然，还有组织文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then of course there's the culture of the organization.</p>
</details>

人们习惯了决策过程相当缓慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know pe people were used it was quite slow in terms of its decision making.</p>
</details>

所以，需要加快节奏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know there was sort of you know increasing the pace.</p>
</details>

第三，坦白说，感谢您成为安盛的股东，投资者信心也是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then look I think thirdly being absolutely honest and by the way thank you for being a shareholder uh in in Aviva. You know it was it was the investor confidence.</p>
</details>

当我与投资者交谈时，他们基本上会说：“安盛一直令人非常失望。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know when I was speaking to investors they were basically saying really you know Aviva's been a big disappointment.</p>
</details>

“我们在2010年至2020年间经历了三次股息削减，我们为什么要投资？有什么不同？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um we've sort we've sort of had three dividend cuts between 2010 and 2020 why would we invest you know what you know what's different and so it was really you know m making sure that we were able to tell that equity story</p>
</details>

所以，这确实是关于确保我们能够讲述好这个股权故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um we've sort we've sort of had three dividend cuts between 2010 and 2020 why would we invest you know what you know what's different and so it was really you know m making sure that we were able to tell that equity story</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 我总觉得在疫情期间做出改变比没有疫情时更容易，因为人们不总是在办公室，他们不能总和所有同事交谈，所以在企业文化方面，我可能觉得改变起来更容易一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know I I somehow think it's easy it was easier to make change during covid than if co hadn't been there because you know people were not uh in the office all the time they couldn't talk to all their colleagues all the time and so in terms of corporate culture I probably think it was a bit easier to change but</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，我认为这并非不实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I I I I I don't think that's untrue.</p>
</details>

问题在于，如果你喜欢亲自与人坐在一起，倾听他们，了解情况，而我就是这样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that the problem was if you're if you like to physically sort of sit with people and listen to them and understand what's going on, which I do.</p>
</details>

我必须找到新的方式来做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I I had to find new ways of doing that.</p>
</details>

所以，通过Teams通话，举办虚拟全体会议，以这种方式了解组织情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, jumping into teams calls, doing sort of virtual town halls, getting a sense of the organization that way.</p>
</details>

在某种程度上，你必须相信一种不同的直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In a way, you had to trust a different instinct.</p>
</details>

所以我确实真诚地认为，在决策方面，疫情绝对是有益的，因为你可以真正快速推进事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I do genuinely think that in terms of decision making co was definitely beneficial because you could really just crack through things particularly if you think about selling businesses you know previously you'd have had to jump on planes go and meet people whereas this in this instance you were basically having team meetings moving on getting documents agreed getting decisions taken that was definitely easier.</p>
</details>

特别是如果你考虑出售业务，以前你必须乘坐飞机去见人，而现在，你基本上可以通过团队会议，推进工作，达成文件协议，做出决策，这绝对更容易。

谈到决策，您以37亿英镑收购了**Direct Line**（英国一家大型保险公司）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talking about decisions, you um bought direct line for3.7 billion pounds.</p>
</details>

为什么这对您来说很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why was that important for you to do?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 是的，我认为当我们审视我们在英国的地位时，我们在大多数产品线都拥有规模优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think look when we looked at our position in the UK we had scale positions across you know most of our product lines but we looked at the opportunity as a customer focused business for uh in in the retail home and motor book and we really thought actually when we looked at direct line genuinely we felt that we could run that business better because we had scale because we had the ability to invest in technology because we had the ability to use digital and you know the the the AI transformation that we'd already undertaken, we could reuse that.</p>
</details>

但我们看到了作为一家以客户为中心的零售家庭和汽车保险业务的机会，我们真的认为，当我们审视Direct Line时，我们真诚地觉得我们可以更好地运营这项业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think look when we looked at our position in the UK we had scale positions across you know most of our product lines but we looked at the opportunity as a customer focused business for uh in in the retail home and motor book and we really thought actually when we looked at direct line genuinely we felt that we could run that business better because we had scale because we had the ability to invest in technology because we had the ability to use digital and you know the the the AI transformation that we'd already undertaken, we could reuse that.</p>
</details>

因为我们有规模，因为我们有能力投资技术，因为我们有能力利用数字化以及我们已经进行的**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，模拟人类智能进行学习、推理和解决问题的技术）转型，我们可以重复利用这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think look when we looked at our position in the UK we had scale positions across you know most of our product lines but we looked at the opportunity as a customer focused business for uh in in the retail home and motor book and we really thought actually when we looked at direct line genuinely we felt that we could run that business better because we had scale because we had the ability to invest in technology because we had the ability to use digital and you know the the the AI transformation that we'd already undertaken, we could reuse that.</p>
</details>

我们觉得我们可以通过自己运营这项业务，为股东带来更好的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We felt that we actually could deliver a better return for shareholders by running that business um ourselves.</p>
</details>

所以，正如您所料，我们当时也考虑了其他一些替代方案，但费用协同效应、资本协同效应和客户利益的实际优势都汇聚在一起，这真的成了一个无需多言的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, as as you would expect, we did look at a number of other alternatives at the time, but the actual benefits of the expense synergies, the capital synergies, and the customer benefits, they sort of all came together and it became a no-brainer really.</p>
</details>

因此，去年11月、12月，我们提出了收购要约，并于今年7月1日完成了交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, yeah, last last November, December, um we made the bid and and we completed the deal in the 1 of July this year.</p>
</details>

### 多元化业务的优势

**Nicolai Tangen:** 一些保险公司专注于单一产品线，而您覆盖了整个产品范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M some insurance companies focus in on one product line whilst you cover the whole spectrum. What are the advantages of doing that?</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M some insurance companies focus in on one product line whilst you cover the whole spectrum. What are the advantages of doing that?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我记得在2020年，很多人对我说，单一产品线业务是未来的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think in 2020 a lot of people said to me um you know a monoline businesses are the way forward.</p>
</details>

他们认为安盛试图做太多事情，多元化业务不再奏效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know effectively Aviva is trying to do too much diversified businesses you know they they don't work anymore.</p>
</details>

我对此持非常不同的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I felt very differently from that.</p>
</details>

首先，拥有所有客户数据，并在客户的整个生命周期中陪伴他们，对我来说很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, for for one thing, having all of the customer data and having the customer through their life cycle felt to me important, but genuinely the diversification benefits for capital are significant when you have various lines of business.</p>
</details>

但真正重要的是，当你拥有多种业务线时，多元化对资本的益处是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, for for one thing, having all of the customer data and having the customer through their life cycle felt to me important, but genuinely the diversification benefits for capital are significant when you have various lines of business.</p>
</details>

我认为在过去五年中，我们看到多元化业务实际上表现更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think what we have seen over the last five years is diversified businesses have actually done better.</p>
</details>

如果您考虑投资，例如**生成式人工智能**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能模型）带来的投资，能够将其分散到20条产品线，而不仅仅是投资于一两条产品线，这无疑会带来巨大的不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you think about investment, so if we think about the investment that will come with generative AI, you know, being able to spread that across 20 product lines and not just have to invest it in one or two definitely makes a big difference.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为今天人们对多元化业务的看法与五年前可能大不相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know, I I I think that people think very differently today about diversified businesses than they did maybe five years ago.</p>
</details>

### 职业生涯中的学习与领导力

**Nicolai Tangen:** 您在其他保险公司也有经验，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you have experiences from other insurance companies too, right?</p>
</details>

在安盛之前，您曾在**苏黎世**（Zurich: 瑞士苏黎世保险集团）和**安盛**（AXA: 法国安盛集团）工作过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You've been at Zurich and and AXA before Aviva.</p>
</details>

您从这些公司中学到了什么，并带到了安盛？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you taken from those companies into Aviva?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我认为，您肯定会从您工作过的每个组织中学到一些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think I mean you definitely take something from every organization that you work in.</p>
</details>

实际上，安盛对我来说情感上更特殊，因为我最初是在**商业联合保险公司**（Commercial Union: 安盛的创始公司之一）开始职业生涯的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean actually aviva is quite an emotional one for me because I actually started in commercial union which was a founding company of Aviva.</p>
</details>

所以，在很多方面，我最终回到了我开始的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know in many respects it's I ended it up in the same company as I started with but I worked for most of my career if if we count it in year terms with AXA you know in two for two different periods and I learned a huge amount from that you know the business the benefit of running a global business a diversified business and I think the opportunity to work with I think what one one of the best leaders which was on Dash I mean he certainly was he transformed AXA you know he made that into a really huge company and then Thomas has obviously taken it from strength to strength.</p>
</details>

但我的职业生涯大部分时间是在**安盛**（AXA: 法国安盛集团）度过的，分为两个不同的时期，我从中学到了很多，包括运营全球化、多元化业务的经验。

<details>

他确实改变了安盛，将其打造成一家非常庞大的公司，而**Thomas Buberl**（法国安盛集团现任首席执行官）显然使其更上一层楼。

但我认为，能够与伟大的领导者合作，了解他们如何让一个组织变得伟大，这对我来说非常重要。

<details>

</details>

我的意思是，我知道首席执行官们不常说这样的话，但如果我们考虑到**审慎监管局**（PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority，英国负责审慎监管金融机构的机构）、**金融行为监管局**（FCA: Financial Conduct Authority，英国负责消费者保护和市场行为监管的机构）和**竞争与市场管理局**（CMA: Competition and Markets Authority，英国负责促进竞争和防止垄断的机构），能够在六个月内获得这三个机构的批准，这确实是一项成就。

### 鼓励退休储蓄与AI对保险业的影响

**Nicolai Tangen:** 您如何让人们为退休储蓄更多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you get people to save more for retirement?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，我认为有几件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think there's a number of things.</p>
</details>

首先，在学校里，人们需要明白，如果你今天退休，你将不会有**确定给付型养老金**（Defined Benefit Pension: 退休金金额由公式确定，与投资表现无关）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think f first of all, understanding in schools that people need to understand that, you know, you're today if you are going to retire, you're not going to have a defined benefit pension.</p>
</details>

你只会拥有**确定缴费型养老金**（Defined Contribution Pension: 退休金金额取决于缴费和投资表现）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're only going to have a defined contribution pension.</p>
</details>

在英国，有1500万人将无法安享退休。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in the UK, 15 million people will not be able to retire well.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这种教育需要从小开始，然后贯穿他们的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think getting that education, it needs to start young and then I think it needs to carry on through um through their working life.</p>
</details>

我认为政府可以提供帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the government can help with that.</p>
</details>

从技术角度看，如果我们考虑像**自动加入养老金计划**（Auto-enrollment: 英国一项强制雇主为符合条件的员工自动加入养老金计划的政策）的年龄，将其从22岁降到18岁，并把缴费比例从目前的8%提高到12%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">technical eye if I think about you know things like autoenrollment age bring the age down from 22 to 18 where you start saving and increase the contribution from what it is today at 8% to 12%.</p>
</details>

这些都是我们知道会带来改变的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are things that we know will make a difference.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这是个人责任、雇主在教育方面的帮助，以及政府在政策方面的帮助的结合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so I think it's a combination of taking individual responsibility, employers can help with education, definitely, you know, the government can help with policy.</p>
</details>

我认为这是所有这些因素的结合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so I think it's a combination of all of those things.</p>
</details>

然后，我认为鼓励投资者不仅要选择默认的养老基金，只投资最安全的资产，还要考虑投资像**私募资产**（Private Assets: 不在公开市场交易的资产，如私募股权、房地产等）这样的东西，从长远来看，它们会带来更好的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I think encouraging investors to think about not just sort of taking the default pension fund and just investing in the safest assets, but thinking about investing in things like private assets that over the longer term will give a better return.</p>
</details>

谈到我们现在看到的一些变化，人工智能（AI）正在如何改变保险业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to some of the changes we're seeing just now. How is AI changing the insurance business?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 哦，天哪，变化巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my gosh, massively.</p>
</details>

如果我想到安盛，我们大约有150个人工智能用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if I think about Aviva, um, you know, we we've got about 150 use cases on on AI.</p>
</details>

我们是人工智能的重度用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, look, we are very big users of AI.</p>
</details>

例如，我们的汽车定价，我们使用人工智能和**机器学习**（Machine Learning: 人工智能的一个分支，使计算机系统能够从数据中学习并改进性能）已经超过10年了，我们零售产品的98%都是通过人工智能定价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if we think about our motor pricing, we've been using AI for over 10 years, machine learning, and like 98% of our retail products are priced using AI.</p>
</details>

所以，举例来说，如果我18岁，买了一辆新的法拉利，我敢打赌我会支付高价，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for instance, if I'm 18 years old and I buy a new Ferrari, I bet I pay a high price, right?</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我的意思是，Nicolai，你可能很难为那辆车投保。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you you probably would struggle to ensure that, Nikolai.</p>
</details>

一个18岁的年轻人开法拉利，这真的负责任吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think an 18year-old driving a Ferrari, I mean, is that really responsible?</p>
</details>

我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know, you know.</p>
</details>

但我们确实长期以来一直在使用所有数据和机器学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but yeah, I mean, we we've been using all of data and machine learning for a very very long time.</p>
</details>

如果你想到英国市场的竞争和活力，我们所有人都在不断使用不同的模型来获得最佳定价点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you think about how how competitive and dynamic the UK market is, we we everybody's sort of constantly using different models to get to your best pricing point.</p>
</details>

但如果我想到一些更令人兴奋的事情，比如在我们的理赔领域，以前客户会打电话给我们查询理赔进度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if I think about some of the more exciting things, you know, in our claims world, for example, um, previously a customer would have been on calling us to check where a claim is in the process.</p>
</details>

他们会联系到一位处理人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They'd have got through to a handler.</p>
</details>

处理人员会从他们那里获取详细信息，然后查看所有不同系统上的所有屏幕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A handler would have taken details from them, looked through all the screens of all the different systems.</p>
</details>

今天，我们基本上使用了人工智能模型来预测客户打电话的可能原因，这样当客户接通电话时，他们基本上是在与一位处理人员交谈，这位处理人员可以说“我能看到您的理赔进度”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today we've we've we've basically used AI models to basic to to to predict the likely reason why the customer is calling so that when the customer gets through on the call they b they're basically speaking to a handler who can say I can see where you are in the claims process.</p>
</details>

他们已经使用人工智能模型完成了所有欺诈检查，他们基本上可以帮助客户处理理赔，而不是在电话的前5到10分钟花费时间获取所有详细信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know they've done all the fraud checks using AI models and they can basically help the customer with the claim rather than spending the first 5 10 minutes of the call taking all of the details.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这个用例可以应用于很多产品，因此，我认为保险业非常适合充分利用人工智能的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that that use case can apply to very many products and so that combination I think insurance is perfectly set to take real advantage of AI.</p>
</details>

### 气候变化对保险业的影响

**Nicolai Tangen:** 气候变化正在如何改变保险业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is climate changing the insurance business?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，我认为**David Attenborough**（英国著名自然历史学家和电视节目主持人）最近说过，气候正在向世界发出求救信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I mean look I think um I think David Atenburgh has recently said something that the climate is sending out distress signals to to the world and if we think about our business in Canada last year we had you know six cat events within about four weeks.</p>
</details>

如果我们想到去年我们在加拿大的业务，我们在大约四周内发生了六次**巨灾事件**（Catastrophe Event: 造成大规模损失的自然灾害或人为事件）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I mean look I think um I think David Atenburgh has recently said something that the climate is sending out distress signals to to the world and if we think about our business in Canada last year we had you know six cat events within about four weeks.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 巨灾事件，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">cat event being catastrophe, right?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 抱歉，是巨灾事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry, but being a catastrophe event.</p>
</details>

抱歉，我用我的保险行业术语说话了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry, talking in my insurance job and um good good that you knew.</p>
</details>

太好了，您知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fantastic.</p>
</details>

嗯，基本上，在四周内，你经历了野火、冰雹风暴和洪水。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know, so so essentially you had you had wildfires, you had hail storms, you had flooding all within, you know, the period of four weeks.</p>
</details>

这显然会影响保险公司，因为我们必须为此定价，必须能够建模，必须管理我们的风险敞口，并且必须真正考虑我们可以在哪些区域承保以及承保的容量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that obviously affects insurers because we have to price for that and we have to be able to model that. We have to manage our exposures and we have to really think about the zones in which we can underwrite and the capacity to which we can underwite.</p>
</details>

所以，气候对我们来说非常重要，缓解一些气候变化确实是我们工作的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So effectively it matters a lot to us. Climate is really really important to us and you know mitigating some of that climate change is really part of of what we do.</p>
</details>

然后，如果我们把自己看作一个投资者，我们在安盛投资者业务中拥有气候科技基金，这关乎为这些公司提供投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then if we think of us as an investor we have you know climate tech funds in our Aviva investors business that's about offering I guess investment to those companies.</p>
</details>

我们正在努力帮助缓解气候变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're trying to help with mitigating that.</p>

所以，气候科技投资。

</details>

我认为这很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it matter it matters a lot.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 然而，世界上有些地方的政治家不认为气候变化正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yet politicians in part of the world don't think it's happening.</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 不，不，我理解这一点，我也理解也许转型会以一种不同于我们2019年、2020年预期的那样发生，那时我认为每个人都非常积极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No no I appreciate I appreciate that and I appreciate also that you know maybe the transition is going to happen in a different way than perhaps we anticipated it would in 2019 2020 when I think everybody was incredibly gung-ho.</p>
</details>

人们不开车，不坐飞机，因为疫情，所以每个人都认为转型会非常快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know people were not driving, people were not flying because of COVID and therefore everybody thought the transition was going to be extremely quick right now.</p>
</details>

我认为现在我们有不同的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think now we have a different view.</p>
</details>

我们更加关注能源安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have much more focus on energy security.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，转型总会在某个时候发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But irrespective the transition will happen at some point.</p>
</details>

我认为问题只是何时，以及如何确保公司、国家、企业和个人开始思考如何减轻气候变化对他们的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the question is just when and the question is ensuring that you know companies, countries, businesses, people do start thinking about how they can mitigate some of the impacts of climate change on them.</p>
</details>

我认为这不会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that changes</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 哪些类型的风险您将不再承保？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what are the type of risks you will you will no longer insure</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 因为气候原因？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because because of the climate</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，我认为在某种程度上，英国一直受到洪水的困扰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think to some extent the UK has struggled with flooding.</p>
</details>

例如，如果我们考虑洪水，这在10到15年前是英国的一个问题，发生了大量的洪水事件，人们发现他们无法获得保险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example um if we think about about flooding and this was a 10 15 year ago issue in the UK lots and lots of flooding events and people were finding that they could not get insurance and that is because houses were being built on flood planes or being built in areas where biodiversity had been sort of you know trees had been taken away so rivers were flooding so so I think that flooding is some of the areas where we struggle in certain areas because of the almost inevitability of flooding happening to be able to ensure that and you know so in the in in the UK we have a scheme called flood which is a sort of insurer governmentbacked scheme to provide insurance for those areas but not interestingly for houses built after I can't remember the exact date I think it's 2001 because then at that point it was known so I think those are the areas where you have to really think about that and then you have to obviously manage your exposure in other areas to say you know for some risks you know we're not going to insure the first 100,000 if you think it's a business or something like in certain areas is so that customers take some of that risk themselves.</p>
</details>

这是因为房屋建在**洪泛区**（Flood Plains: 河流或湖泊附近，在洪水期间可能被淹没的平坦区域），或者建在**生物多样性**（Biodiversity: 地球上生命的多样性，包括物种、基因和生态系统的多样性）被破坏的区域，例如树木被砍伐，导致河流泛滥。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example um if we think about about flooding and this was a 10 15 year ago issue in the UK lots and lots of flooding events and people were finding that they could not get insurance and that is because houses were being built on flood planes or being built in areas where biodiversity had been sort of you know trees had been taken away so rivers were flooding so so I think that flooding is some of the areas where we struggle in certain areas because of the almost inevitability of flooding happening to be able to ensure that and you know so in the in in the UK we have a scheme called flood which is a sort of insurer governmentbacked scheme to provide insurance for those areas but not interestingly for houses built after I can't remember the exact date I think it's 2001 because then at that point it was known so I think those are the areas where you have to really think about that and then you have to obviously manage your exposure in other areas to say you know for some risks you know we're not going to insure the first 100,000 if you think it's a business or something like in certain areas is so that customers take some of that risk themselves.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为洪水是我们难以在某些区域承保的领域之一，因为洪水发生的几乎必然性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example um if we think about about flooding and this was a 10 15 year ago issue in the UK lots and lots of flooding events and people were finding that they could not get insurance and that is because houses were being built on flood planes or being built in areas where biodiversity had been sort of you know trees had been taken away so rivers were flooding so so I think that flooding is some of the areas where we struggle in certain areas because of the almost inevitability of flooding happening to be able to ensure that and you know so in the in in the UK we have a scheme called flood which is a sort of insurer governmentbacked scheme to provide insurance for those areas but not interestingly for houses built after I can't remember the exact date I think it's 2001 because then at that point it was known so I think those are the areas where you have to really think about that and then you have to obviously manage your exposure in other areas to say you know for some risks you know we're not going to insure the first 100,000 if you think it's a business or something like in certain areas is so that customers take some of that risk themselves.</p>
</details>

在英国，我们有一个名为**Flood Re**（英国政府支持的洪水保险计划: 旨在帮助高风险地区居民获得可负担的洪水保险）的计划，这是一个由保险公司和政府共同支持的计划，为这些区域提供保险，但有趣的是，不包括2001年（我记不清确切日期了，我想是2001年）之后建造的房屋，因为那时洪水风险已经为人所知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example um if we think about about flooding and this was a 10 15 year ago issue in the UK lots and lots of flooding events and people were finding that they could not get insurance and that is because houses were being built on flood planes or being built in areas where biodiversity had been sort of you know trees had been taken away so rivers were flooding so so I think that flooding is some of the areas where we struggle in certain areas because of the almost inevitability of flooding happening to be able to ensure that and you know so in the in in the UK we have a scheme called flood which is a sort of insurer governmentbacked scheme to provide insurance for those areas but not interestingly for houses built after I can't remember the exact date I think it's 2001 because then at that point it was known so I think those are the areas where you have to really think about that and then you have to obviously manage your exposure in other areas to say you know for some risks you know we're not going to insure the first 100,000 if you think it's a business or something like in certain areas is so that customers take some of that risk themselves.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这些是你必须真正考虑的领域，然后你必须在其他领域管理你的风险敞口，例如对于某些风险，我们不会承保前10万英镑，这样客户自己承担一部分风险。

我们有很多客户在那里，人们会重建他们的房屋，他们会第三次重建厨房，但他们仍然会铺错地板，仍然会安装木制橱柜，仍然会在地板上安装插座。

**Amanda Blanc:** 很多时候，您会看到——我不知道您是否也经常看到——您会听到领导力演讲，听到各种策略，人们会说：“我有一个很棒的策略。”

<p class="english-text">So, so many times you see um I I don't know about you, you must see it all the time. You hear leadership presentations and you hear strategies and people say, "I've got this great strategy."</p>

<p class="english-text">And then, you know, you sort of look back five years later and go, I wonder what happened with that.</p>

我认为策略很棒，但执行更重要。

<p class="english-text">You know, and um and I I think strategy is great, execution is better.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你能很好地执行一个80%完善的策略，你可能会比拥有一个100%完美的策略但未能贯彻执行做得更好。

<p class="english-text">Um, so you know I think you can if you execute well on a sort of 80% there strategy you would probably do better than you have you have a 100% brilliant strategy and don't follow through on the execution.</p>

<p class="english-text">I think that's really important, too.</p>
</details>

我曾经看到一项研究说，如果你被授予爵士或女爵士头衔，公司的业绩会随后恶化，因为人们更多地考虑社会，更多地将自己视为国家公务员，因此在解雇员工等方面会更加犹豫。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I saw a piece of research once which said that if you were kned or appointed a dame uh the results of the company uh deteriorated afterwards because people thought more because people thought more about society and uh uh saw themselves a bit more as a state person and therefore were more hesitant for instance to lay off people.</p>
</details>

您认为这其中有道理吗？

</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 不，我没有。

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** 没错。

成为威尔士人意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does it mean what does it mean to be Welsh?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我为自己是威尔士人感到无比自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I I mean I'm incredibly proud uh of being Welsh.</p>
</details>

威尔士是一个非常小的国家，人口340万。

<p class="english-text">Um so you know Wales is a very small country um you know 34 million people.</p>

<details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 我认为这种驱动力是来自那种背景，看到那个社区发生了什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think the drive I think what is the driving force is that coming from that background and seeing what happened to that community.</p>

当我看到那里很多人所经历的一切时，这绝对是一种驱动力，即使是今天，我的妈妈仍然住在**朗达谷**（Rhonnda Valley: 位于南威尔士的一个历史悠久的煤矿谷地），我经常回去，你会看到那里仍然没有恢复，这绝对是一种驱动力。

您年轻时演奏过很多乐器。

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，好的。

<p class="english-text">I mean, so I played the piano and the clarinet and of course like all good Welsh people, I sang in in the local chapel and in the choir.</p>

我认为音乐只是一种真正的解脱。

我喜欢各种音乐。

我爱它。

在很多方面，它是一种平衡器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

一些最有才华的音乐家，他们拥有真正的天赋，尽管我没有真正的天赋，我必须努力练习。

### 社交媒体与阅读习惯

**Nicolai Tangen:** 您有一个关于鞋子的社交媒体频道。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You have a social media channel about your shoes.</p>
</details>

那是关于什么的？

<details>

</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 那与我无关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was nothing to do with me.</p>
</details>

我得说，大约10到12年前，我们在曼彻斯特有一个名为**Biba**（英国保险经纪人协会的年度会议）的保险会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to say there was about 10 12 years ago and we had there's a insurance conference in Manchester called Bieber and um we we were on our way to this conference and I like wearing different types of shoes and one of my team when I was at Access said I think we should create a we should create um a social media account for your shoes Amanda and I was like oh right yeah okay next thing I knew they had this account and it would basically follow my shoes around the conference you know the different shoes and then of course it became a bit of a thing um but yes It's uh it's just a bit of fun.</p>
</details>

我们当时正要去参加这个会议，我喜欢穿不同类型的鞋子，我当时在安盛（AXA）的一个团队成员说：“Amanda，我想我们应该为你的鞋子创建一个社交媒体账户。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I have to say there was about 10 12 years ago and we had there's a insurance conference in Manchester called Bieber and um we we were on our way to this conference and I like wearing different types of shoes and one of my team when I was at Access said I think we should create a we should create um a social media account for your shoes Amanda and I was like oh right yeah okay next thing I knew they had this account and it would basically follow my shoes around the conference you know the different shoes and then of course it became a bit of a thing um but yes It's uh it's just a bit of fun.</p>

您读些什么？

<p class="english-text">What do you read?</p>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，以前我读很多小说和商业书籍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so look, I used to read loads and loads of novels, business books.</p>
</details>

今天我更多的是播客听众，我不得不说，包括您自己的优秀播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

我现在肯定听了大约15到20个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I must have listened now to about 15 or 20 20 of them.</p>
</details>

但我认为听播客是一种了解正在发生什么的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I I think that listening to the podcast, it's a way of sort of, you know, finding out what's going on.</p>
</details>

比如**《政治的余波》**（The Rest Is Politics: 英国的一个政治播客）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So rest is politics.</p>
</details>

我真的很喜欢那种，你一边听着辩论，一边可以做其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I I I I really like that where you're sort of listening, you're listening to the debates.</p>
</details>

我可以在**跑步机**（Treadmill: 健身器材，用于室内跑步或步行）上，或者骑自行车，或者做其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um at the at the same time as you can sometimes be doing something else. I can be on the treadmill or I can be on my bike or doing something else.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这是一种非常高效的时间利用方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think it's quite an efficient use of time.</p>

### 给年轻人的建议

**Nicolai Tangen:** 最后，我们有成千上万的年轻听众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lastly, we got um many thousand young listeners.</p>
</details>

您对年轻人最好的建议是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your best advice to young people?</p>
</details>

**Amanda Blanc:** 嗯，首先，我认为要培养你的韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well well first of all I think um build up your resilience.</p>
</details>

我认为今天的年轻人很艰难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's tough for young people today.</p>
</details>

如果我们想到他们成长的环境，社交媒体，持续的反馈，无论是气候还是转型，劳动力变化，**生成式人工智能**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能模型），我认为他们需要非常强的韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we think about, you know, the environment in which they're they're they're growing up in social media, you know, the constant feedback, um the, you know, whether it's climate or the transition, the change in workforce regenerative AI, I think they're going to need to be really resilient.</p>
</details>

所以，他们应该真正思考如何培养自己的韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, they should really think about things that they can do to build their resilience.</p>
</details>

其次，我想说的是，抓住摆在您面前的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the second thing I would say is like take the opportunities that are given to you.</p>
</details>

很多人会过度思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's so many times that people overthink things.</p>
</details>

你知道，有时事情会成功，有时不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, sometimes things will work out and sometimes they will not.</p>
</details>

但要抓住机会，因为你永远不知道它们会把你带向何方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But take opportunities because you just never know where they're going to end up.</p>
</details>

所以，无论是在学校，参加不同的俱乐部，尝试唱歌，尝试乐器，尝试不同的运动，只要抓住这些真正的机会，你永远不知道会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So whether that's at school, go to different clubs, try singing, try musical instruments, try different sports, just take those real opportunities and you just never know what might happen.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai Tangen:** Amanda，您是抓住所有机会并从中取得巨大成就的绝佳典范。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Amato, you're a wonderful example of somebody who's taken all the opportunities and really uh made so much out of it.</p>
