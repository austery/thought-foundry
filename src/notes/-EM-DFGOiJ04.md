### 市场回顾：逢低买入者归来

About two minutes away from the end of the trading day, Katie Grifeld and Matt Miller in for Roma Bosik, and here to help take us through the closing bell, we're joined by a global simulcast, Carol Masser and Bailey Lipult, he's in for Tim Stenovic, bringing together all of our audiences, Carol Masser to parse through the most crucial moments of this trading day on this Monday. And the **dip buyers** (Dip Buyers: 投资者在资产价格下跌后进行购买), they're back.

距离交易日结束还有大约两分钟，Katie Grifeld和Matt Miller代班Roma Bosik，我们与全球联播的Carol Masser和代班Tim Stenovic的Bailey Lipult一同回顾收盘时刻，汇聚所有观众，Carol Masser将分析本周一交易日最关键的时刻。而那些**逢低买入者**，他们回来了。

Yeah, right. What a different tone from Friday. But, you know, also we got to write a love letter to OpenAI and Broadcom because the **semiconductors** (Semiconductors: 导电性介于导体和绝缘体之间的材料) really some outperformance up about 5%. A lot of it, you know, barely had to do with Broadcom today.

没错，和周五相比，今天的市场情绪截然不同。我们还得向**OpenAI** (OpenAI: 一家专注于人工智能研究和部署的美国人工智能研究实验室) 和**博通** (Broadcom Inc.: 一家全球领先的基础设施技术公司) 致敬，因为**半导体**板块表现出色，上涨了大约5%。其中很多涨幅，你知道，今天几乎都与博通有关。

And who even cares about a **government shutdown** (Government Shutdown: 指政府因缺乏资金而停止提供非必要服务的情况) in a market like this? Yes, we've barely talked about it today.

在这样的市场中，谁还会关心**政府停摆**呢？是的，我们今天几乎没有谈论过它。

Didn't even mention it. Didn't even cross our minds. And yet, the major averages are up almost 2%, S&P up more than 1.5%. And Katie and Matt, guys, the bond market's closed, but stocks are partying.

我们甚至都没提过，它根本没在我们的考虑范围之内。然而，主要平均指数上涨了近2%，**标普500** (S&P 500: Standard & Poor's 500 Index，一个包含500家美国大型上市公司股票的市值加权指数) 上涨超过1.5%。Katie和Matt，各位，债券市场休市了，但股市却在狂欢。

Yeah, I think to some extent the administration took the teeth out of that shutdown by agreeing to pay or finding the money to pay the military at least on Wednesday when the next check is due. But I think it's really interesting that we've gone so far so fast. You know, BTI was out with a note yesterday saying that we're still above the **50-day moving average** (Moving Average: 一种平滑价格数据以识别趋势的技术指标) and have been for 113 days. That's the third longest stretch since 1990. That's before Bailey and Katie were even born.

是的，我认为在某种程度上，政府同意支付或找到了资金来支付军费，至少在下周三下一笔款项到期时，这削弱了停摆的影响。但我觉得我们如此迅速地走得这么远，这真的很有趣。你知道，BTI昨天发布了一份报告说，我们仍然高于**50日移动平均线**，并且已经持续了113天。这是自1990年以来第三长的持续时间。那是在Bailey和Katie出生之前。

That might be true actually. But I mean it's a good point that we have been so strong for so long and we really haven't seen a dip to buy in quite a long time. So of course a lot of this is OpenAI, but a lot of this is just folks seizing on a sale right now.

这可能确实是真的。但我的意思是，我们长期以来一直如此强势，而且我们确实很久没有看到可以逢低买入的机会了，这是一个很好的观点。所以当然，这很大程度上是OpenAI的功劳，但也有很多是人们抓住当前销售机会的结果。

And that's definitely was the story of this market action on this Monday. You can see the S&P 500 looks like we're going to finish about 1.5% higher. You take a look at the **NASDAQ** (NASDAQ: National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations，一个全球电子证券交易市场) doing even better. That's a lot of that chip influence coming through there. The NASDAQ finishing 2.2% higher on the day. We show the **Dow Jones** (Dow Jones Industrial Average: 道琼斯工业平均指数，一个由30家美国知名公司组成的股票市场指数) here. I wouldn't. It's not my favorite index, but we'll do it. It's up about 1.3%.

这无疑是本周一市场走势的主旋律。你可以看到标普500指数看起来将收涨约1.5%。再看看**纳斯达克**指数，表现甚至更好。这其中很大一部分是芯片板块的影响。纳斯达克指数当天收涨2.2%。我们这里展示**道琼斯指数**。我不会。它不是我最喜欢的指数，但我们还是会展示它。它上涨了大约1.3%。

Carol Masser. I know what's wrong with the Dow. She likes the small caps. The thing is it's a price weighted index. How much of a signal can you get from that?

Carol Masser。我知道道琼斯指数的问题。她喜欢小盘股。问题在于它是一个价格加权指数。你能从中获得多少信号呢？

Matt, remember way back when we only used to like talk largely about the Dow?

Matt，你还记得很久以前我们主要只谈论道琼斯指数的时候吗？

I remember Dow 6000. I know. All right, let's go to the S&P 500. We'll put the Dow aside for a moment. Most names in the index higher, guys, today. 359 gaining ground, 142 to the downside. Matt, two unchanged.

我记得道琼斯指数6000点的时候。我知道。好吧，让我们转向标普500指数。我们暂时把道琼斯指数放一边。各位，今天指数中大多数股票都上涨了。359只上涨，142只下跌。Matt，有两只未变。

### 行业表现与个股亮点

Take a look at the industry groups moving higher and you'll see pretty much all of them that aren't defensive did. So, you've got **consumer staples** (Consumer Staples: 必需消费品，指消费者无论经济状况如何都需要购买的产品和服务) down. And if you look at the S&P, which is, I think Katie agrees, you know, much better yard stick. It's the index you can see that you had a lot of consumer staples on the downside, Proctor and Gamble, Philip Morris at one point one of the biggest losers on the index. Altria Group also these are things that you either need to buy again every month or you're just addicted to so you have no choice. But for the most part you had every other group rising healthcare you see down but really just unchanged.

看看上涨的行业板块，你会发现除了防御性板块，几乎所有板块都上涨了。所以，**必需消费品**板块下跌。如果你看标普指数，我认为Katie也同意，它是一个更好的衡量标准。从这个指数你可以看到，有很多必需消费品公司下跌，宝洁、菲利普莫里斯一度是指数中跌幅最大的公司之一。奥驰亚集团也是。这些都是你每个月都需要再次购买，或者你已经上瘾了所以别无选择的产品。但总的来说，其他所有板块都在上涨，医疗保健板块看起来下跌，但实际上只是持平。

All right guys, let's get to some of the individual gainers. No surprise I'm going to talk about Broadcom. Of course, ticker AVGO up as much as almost 11% finishing the day with a gain of just shy of 10%. Number two gainer in the S&P 500, number one gainer in the NASDAQ 100. No, number two, forgive me. But nonetheless, really just pushed the whole semis sector higher in today's session. This as OpenAI signed a multi-year agreement with Broadcom to collaborate on custom chips and networking equipment. So, it's the latest step in OpenAI's ambitious plan to add computing infrastructure, but it really gave some juice to Broadcom.

好的各位，我们来看看一些个股的涨幅。毫无疑问，我要谈谈博通。当然，股票代码AVGO一度上涨近11%，收盘时涨幅略低于10%。它是标普500指数的第二大涨幅股，纳斯达克100指数的第一大涨幅股。不，是第二大，请原谅我。但尽管如此，它确实推动了整个半导体板块在今天的交易中走高。此前，OpenAI与博通签署了一项多年协议，将在定制芯片和网络设备方面进行合作。这是OpenAI雄心勃勃的增加计算基础设施计划的最新一步，但它确实给博通带来了动力。

All right. The other thing that was kind of a broader story today was when you look at **rare earth and critical mineral** (Critical Minerals: 对现代技术至关重要的原材料，稀土元素是其中一类) stocks rising following strong gains among Asian peers, fresh tensions between Beijing and Washington over China's exports of critical minerals, fueling bets on alternative suppliers. So, two names I just want to show. Critical Metals up almost 55% in today's session. And then MP Materials up just about 21%. Remember MP Materials is the one that the US government has taken a stake in along with some other investments in raw materials companies.

好的。今天另一个更广泛的故事是，当我们看到**稀土和关键矿物**股票上涨，此前亚洲同行也录得强劲涨幅，这源于北京和华盛顿之间因中国关键矿物出口问题而产生的新一轮紧张关系，从而推动了对替代供应商的押注。所以，我想展示两个名字。关键金属公司在今天的交易中上涨了近55%。而MP Materials上涨了大约21%。请记住，MP Materials是美国政府以及其他对原材料公司的投资中持有股份的公司。

And then I got to mention Warner Brothers up almost 4% here. This as the company according to reports that cited people familiar with the matter rejected Paramount SkyDance's initial takeover approach for being too low.

然后我必须提到华纳兄弟在这里上涨了近4%。据报道，知情人士透露，该公司拒绝了派拉蒙Skydance最初的收购提议，理由是报价过低。

Can I just go ahead, can I just interject with a little bit of an editorial comment?

我能插一句编辑性评论吗？

This is very Roma of you. So go ahead.

这很像Roma的风格。所以请继续。

I know I'm like what? I thought I could get through it and then just pass the baton. No, because Carol, because you and Tim were there at Screen Time last week and Lucas Shaw's conversation with David Ellison was amazing.

我知道我像什么？我以为我可以讲完，然后把接力棒传下去。不，因为Carol，因为你和Tim上周在Screen Time节目上，Lucas Shaw与David Ellison的对话非常精彩。

It was amazing.

非常精彩。

I understand so much more about the company, about the industry, about their aim.

我对公司、行业以及他们的目标有了更多的了解。

That's funny because Laura Martin of Needham said, she goes, "I don't feel like David Ellison has really laid out his strategy that he keeps making these acquisitions but not kind of saying what the overall strategy is." I'm just just sharing you cuz she talked with us at Screen Time.

这很有趣，因为Needham的Laura Martin说，“我觉得David Ellison并没有真正阐明他的策略，他一直在进行这些收购，但却没有说明整体策略是什么。”我只是分享给你，因为她和我们在Screen Time谈过。

I just thought it was good. So good. Go back and listen to it if you haven't. Or buy tickets for next year. Bailey, there were stocks that fell today.

我只是觉得很好。非常好。如果你还没听过，回去听听。或者买明年的票。Bailey，今天也有股票下跌。

### 市场输家与特殊事件

There are stocks that fell today and the worst performer in the S&P 500 is not in the Dow Jones Industrials. Katie, that is Fastenal, ticker FAS, falling the most since March 2020. This came after earnings. CEO told Carol and I that their stock was actually priced to perfection and that's why they were down. But analysts called out some soft pricing overshadowing results that at the top line actually weren't that bad.

今天有股票下跌，标普500指数中表现最差的股票不在道琼斯工业平均指数中。Katie，那是Fastenal，股票代码FAS，自2020年3月以来跌幅最大。这发生在财报发布后。CEO告诉Carol和我，他们的股票实际上已经完美定价，这就是他们下跌的原因。但分析师指出，一些疲软的定价掩盖了营收方面实际上还不错的业绩。

And I want to call out this second and third worst performers in the S&P 500 casino stocks. We saw both Las Vegas Sands and Win Resorts under pressure each falling more than 6%. Not because people aren't going to Las Vegas, but there's a holiday on the other side of the world and that's **Golden Week** (Golden Week: 黄金周，指中国的一个全国性假期，通常持续七天). And we saw Macau data disappointing. So investors really selling down those two stocks. Again, Las Vegas Sands ticker LVS down more than 6% worst drop since earlier in the month, but closing at the lowest level since June.

我想指出标普500指数中第二和第三差的股票是赌场股。我们看到拉斯维加斯金沙和永利度假村都面临压力，各自下跌超过6%。这并不是因为人们不去拉斯维加斯，而是因为世界另一端有一个假期，那就是**黄金周**。我们看到澳门的数据令人失望。因此投资者大量抛售这两只股票。再次强调，拉斯维加斯金沙（股票代码LVS）下跌超过6%，是本月初以来的最大跌幅，但收盘价为六月以来的最低水平。

And guys, I just want to wrap up with one of my favorite stocks to cover. **Beyond Meat** (Beyond Meat: 一家生产植物性肉类替代品的美国公司), ticker BN.

各位，我想以我最喜欢报道的股票之一来结束。**Beyond Meat**，股票代码BN。

Is that cuz you like to eat it?

那是因为你喜欢吃它吗？

I do not like to eat it. I'm questioning it. It's a little concerning how it bleeds, but it was at one point one of the best stocks to **IPO** (Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股，指一家公司首次向公众发行股票) ever.

我不喜欢吃它。我对此表示怀疑。它“流血”的方式有点令人担忧，但它曾一度是史上表现最好的**首次公开募股**股票之一。

Very real. It was, it was, it was, you know, it's a very logical fundamental argument at least when the stock was trading for whatever number it was, but closing at a record low losing about half its value. This came after debt investors swapped their notes for shares diluting investors. So it does seem like a slow burn to the end for Beyond Meat.

非常真实。它曾是，你知道，一个非常符合逻辑的基本面论点，至少在股票交易到某个数字的时候是这样，但现在却以历史新低收盘，市值损失了大约一半。此前，债务投资者将其票据转换为股票，稀释了投资者权益。所以Beyond Meat似乎正在缓慢走向终结。

Yeah, pour out some beet juice for Beyond Meat. The bond market was closed today. It was one of those weird days where equities were open, bonds were closed. I want to take a look at **TLT** (TLT: iShares 20+ 年期美国国债ETF，追踪长期美国国债表现的交易所交易基金) here though. This of course tracks 20-year treasuries and beyond. And you can see that it's just about flat on the day. It opened up lower. That would have meant that yields were higher, but you can see it finished just about unchanged. So that sets us up.

是的，为Beyond Meat倒一些甜菜汁吧（意为哀悼）。今天债券市场休市。这是那些奇怪的日子之一，股市开盘，债券市场却关闭了。不过我想看看这里的**TLT**。这当然追踪的是20年期及更长期国债。你可以看到它在当天基本持平。它开盘时走低。那意味着收益率会更高，但你可以看到它收盘时几乎没有变化。所以这为我们奠定了基础。

### 财富转移与泰勒·斯威夫特效应

Well, shall we talk about Taylor Swift though because she did have an impact in the stock market here. I wonder if Carol if you know the way that Katie talks about Taylor Swift and her impact or her importance respectfully.

那么，我们是不是该谈谈泰勒·斯威夫特了？因为她确实在这里对股市产生了一些影响。Carol，我想知道你是否知道Katie是如何尊敬地谈论泰勒·斯威夫特以及她的影响或重要性的。

Um, yeah, I call her what do you say? I call her the Bob Dylan of our generation, the millennial generation for millennial women. And I'm willing to back that up. I'm not the biggest Taylor Swift fan out there, Carol. I am a huge fan. But just in terms of her impact, I think that that's a pretty fair characterization.

嗯，是的，我称她为什么？我称她为我们这一代人的鲍勃·迪伦，千禧一代女性的鲍勃·迪伦。我愿意支持这个说法。Carol，我不是泰勒·斯威夫特最大的粉丝。我是一个忠实粉丝。但就她的影响力而言，我认为这是一个相当公正的描述。

Well, you know what's interesting? You talk about impact and you know some of it is just what she does up on stage fighting for rights in terms of owning your own material if you will, but she's also become pretty wealthy and with money comes influence and I just want to mention I know we're going to go back to Taylor but there's an interesting story on the Bloomberg about how kind of Wall Street's been getting ready for this incredible wealth transfer of like 105 trillion to pass from elderly parents to children but Bailey there's actually a different kind of wealth transfer already underway and we're talking about women who are actually becoming billionaires after the death of their spouses.

你知道什么有趣吗？你谈到影响力，你知道其中一部分是她在舞台上为拥有自己的作品而奋斗，但她也变得非常富有，而金钱带来了影响力。我只想提一下，我知道我们还要回到泰勒，但彭博社有一篇有趣的文章，讲的是华尔街如何为这笔高达105万亿美元的惊人财富转移做准备，这笔财富将从年迈的父母传给子女。但Bailey，实际上还有另一种财富转移正在进行中，我们谈论的是那些在配偶去世后成为亿万富翁的女性。

Yeah. Bloomberg reporting that more than a dozen women in the world's 500 richest people have become billionaires because of that overseeing fortunes totaling 365 billion dollars. That's a lot of money to be.

是的。彭博社报道称，全球500位最富有的人中，有十几位女性因此成为了亿万富翁，她们管理的财富总计达3650亿美元。这是一大笔钱。

Yeah. And it means a lot of influence whether it's, you know, philanthropy, finance, consumer goods, get like a lot of things. So now we go back to Taylor who is pretty wealthy and she's influential. You know Katie and I we used to co-anchor a show called Bloomberg Open Interest.

是的。这意味着巨大的影响力，无论是慈善、金融、消费品，还是其他很多方面。所以现在我们回到泰勒，她非常富有，也很有影响力。你知道，Katie和我以前共同主持过一个节目叫《彭博开放兴趣》。

It still airs I'm told 9 to 11 weekdays. Tune in. We talked to Sally Krawcheck on that program if you recall and she said that we're going to see like I think massive numbers like 35 or 40 trillion dollars shifted in this silver tsunami. Maybe it was even more. But the lion's share of that is going to shift from the control of men to the control of women. So that's going to be...

我听说它仍然在工作日的上午9点到11点播出。请收看。如果你还记得，我们在那个节目中采访了Sally Krawcheck，她说我们将会看到，我认为是巨大的数字，比如35万亿或40万亿美元，在这场“银发海啸”中转移。也许甚至更多。但这其中大部分将从男性的控制转移到女性的控制。所以那将会是……

As it should.

理应如此。

It's really interesting too. You think about all the different ripple effects there. One of them being what does this mean for the financial advisor community. There are a lot of things that we'll have to adjust to sort of accommodate what that new phase of wealth looks like.

这真的很有趣。你想到所有不同的连锁反应。其中之一就是这对金融顾问群体意味着什么。我们需要调整很多东西来适应这种新的财富阶段。

I heard Carol and Tim talking to April Rudin about this last week.

我上周听到Carol和Tim和April Rudin谈论这件事。

Oh my God, I'm so God, I'm just warmed. He's your biggest fan.

哦我的天哪，我真是太感动了。他是你最大的粉丝。

I thought we were going to talk about the docu series. Like she's going to make she's going to make a six-part docu series about the Eras Tour, which regardless of how you feel about her music, even if you think that she only had one good album in her entire catalog, the one about the cardigan and...

我以为我们要谈论纪录片系列。比如她将制作一个关于Eras巡演的六集纪录片系列，无论你对她的音乐感觉如何，即使你认为她整个音乐生涯中只有一张好专辑，就是关于那件羊毛衫的专辑，还有……

Folklore.

《Folklore》。

Exactly. 1989. But sure, you still can't deny the impact that her Eras tour had on, you know, the global economy. Really?

没错。《1989》。但是当然，你仍然不能否认她的Eras巡演对全球经济产生的影响。真的吗？

I saw it in Toronto and let me tell you that was a production.

我在多伦多看过，我跟你说那真是一场盛大的制作。
