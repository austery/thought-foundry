### 欢迎与生日祝福

大家好，欢迎回到本频道。我们又回到了每日回顾的节目。感谢大家的收看。今天是周一，全新一周的开始。首先，我只想感谢所有今天向我送上生日祝福的朋友们，这对我意义重大。我们庆祝了开盘和收盘，并在收盘时进行了一次赠品活动，非常有趣。是的，我在开盘和收盘时花了很多时间谈论它，但我只是深深地、深深地、深深地、深深地感激我目前在生活中的位置。随着我年龄的增长，28岁了，我开始更多地反思生活中发生的一切，以及过去几年我们建立的社区，它对我来说真的意味着一切。所以，我非常感谢所有联系我的人。感谢大家的生日祝福。你们的男孩28岁了，离“而立之年”只剩两年。我知道很多观众可能比28岁大得多，但你们基本上见证了我过去五年的成长，希望未来也能继续见证我的成长。

<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. Thank you everybody for being here. It is officially Monday, brand new start to the week. First of all, I just want to say thank you to everyone who reached out and said happy birthday today. Uh really means a ton. We got to celebrate it on the market open, market close, did a giveaway on the close and that was really fun and yeah, I spent a lot of time talking about it on the open and the close, but uh just deeply deeply deeply deeply appreciate the position that I'm in in life. And you know, as I get older, 20 years old, uh start to reflect a lot more on what has been happening in life and uh you know, the community we built over the past couple years, it it it truly means everything to me. So, I just really appreciate everyone that reached out. Thank you all for the birthday wishes. Your boy is 28. Two years from the dirty 30s. I know a lot of people watching are probably much older than 28, but uh you know, you guys have basically seen me grow up over the next five years, and hopefully we'll continue to see me grow up coming into the future.</p>

今天我们有很多事情要谈。**Palantir**（Palantir Technologies: 一家大数据分析公司）获得了一份新的大合同，一份巨额合同。此外，Palantir的股价也创下了历史新高。这真是一份非常棒的生日礼物。所以，谢谢你，Palantir。接下来，我们将讨论Palantir的最新情况。**特斯拉**（Tesla: 一家电动汽车及清洁能源公司）在市场上获得了一些评级上调。市场对自动驾驶汽车的未来发展越来越兴奋，这就是为什么你看到特斯拉今天股价上涨了约5%。此外，一些半导体公司正在崭露头角，并可能挑战该领域的一些现有巨头。所以，我们稍后会详细讨论这一点。然后是更广泛的宏观经济。我的意思是，**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）创下了历史新高，当天上涨了1%。今天几乎所有股票都相对上涨。今天市场中也有一些下跌的板块，但总体而言，市场表现相当强劲。我们将更多地讨论宏观经济，以及它对年底的影响，还有我对当前牛市性质的总体看法。再次感谢大家的收看。再次感谢大家的生日祝福。让我们开始吧。

<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about today. Palanteer, big new contract, massive contract. Also, new all-time highs on Palunteer. It was a very nice birthday present. So, thank you, Palanteer. Uh, so we'll talk about what's going on with Palanteer. Tassy got some upgrades on the street. Street's getting a lot more excited about where autonomous vehicles are going, and that's why you saw Tesla get a bit of a 5% move today. Uh, some semiconductor companies are starting to pop up and potentially challenge some of the other incumbents in the space. So, we'll talk a bit more about that. And then the broader macro. I mean, we have all-time highs on the S&P 500, up 1% on the day. Pretty much every stock has been relatively green today. There were some pockets of the market today that were red, but overall, it was a pretty strong green day for the markets. And we're going to talk a little bit more about macro and what that means going into the end of the year and kind of my overall thoughts on the nature of this bull market. So, thank you everybody for being here. Thank you again for the happy birthday wishes. Let's get into it.</p>

### Palantir：新合同与西方操作系统愿景

好的，我们先从Palantir开始，然后进入宏观经济和当前的市场动态。首先，Palantir今天表现非常出色。恭喜各位股东。我今天能有这样的地位，其中一个原因就是Palantir，以及在我选择分析这家公司时，它还是一家小公司。显然，它彻底改变了我的生活，也改变了我们许多人的生活。今天Palantir的表现相当强劲。它的股价一度达到19.28美元，这相当惊人。最终没有收于19.2美元，而是收于18.9美元。那么，为什么今天会发生这种情况呢？嗯，有几个原因。首先，我们上周谈过。**Palantir**首席执行官卡普（Karp）在**Fox Business**（福克斯商业频道）上接受了新的采访，他们与**Lumen**（Lumen Technologies: 一家美国电信公司）达成了2亿美元的合作关系，这非常重要。显然，Lumen在政府领域是一家大型公司，他们与Palantir合作的合同已经开始真正影响Palantir的市场进入策略，特别是在与一些第三方公司合作，为许多不同合同提供服务、充当供应商和分销商方面。从Palantir的角度来看，数据分析对这些供应商和分销商至关重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, let's start off with Palunteer and then we'll get into the macro and what's kind of going on. First of all, Palanteer, massive day. Congratulations shareholders. One of the reasons why I am even in the uh the position I'm in today is because of Palanteer uh and choosing to analyze this company when it was a much smaller company and obviously it has completely changed my life, changed so many of our lives and you got Palanteer that had a pretty strong day. Now it hit 1928 at one point which is pretty incredible. Didn't close at 192, closed at 189. Uh now why did that happen today? Well there's a couple reasons. Number one, we talked about this last week. Karp did a new interview on Fox Business and they had a $200 million partnership with Lumen which was very very important. Obviously Lumen is a massive company in the government space and the contracts that they've been able to work on with Palare has started to really influence the way that Pounder thinks of their go to market particularly with working with some of these other thirdparty companies when it comes to servicing and being a vendor and distributor for a lot of different contracts. And you know from Pounders perspective the data analytics play for those vendor and distributors.</p>
</details>

今天，他们与**波兰国防部**签署了一项新协议。以下是Palantir的声明：“Palantir致力于与波兰合作，并很荣幸能深化我们与国防部的伙伴关系。今天的协议为Palantir的**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）赋能国防技术迅速支持波兰武装部队铺平了道路，帮助他们在日益复杂的威胁环境中走在创新前沿，并巩固波兰作为国防领域主权领导者的地位。”所以，这是一份与波兰国防部合作的意向书。我们看到Palantir已经开始真正扩大与世界各国政府的合作。英国国防部在9月底、10月初刚刚给了他们一份价值10亿美元的合同。所以，这非常令人欣喜。显然，Palantir与美国政府的合作也持续积极扩张，因为他们与政府合作的项目越来越多地被政府认可，并表示：“嘿，我们需要购买这个软件来合作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today they signed a new agreement with Poland's Ministry of Defense. Here's what Pounder said. Pouchers committed to Poland and proud to deepen our partnership with the Ministry of Defense. Today's agreement paves the way for Poucher's AI enabled defense technology to begin rapidly supporting the country's armed forces as they innovate at the forefront of an increasingly complex threat environment and strengthen Poland's position as a sovereign leader in defense. So, this was a letter of intent to work with Poland's defense ministry. We've seen that pound started to really expand their work with the international governments across the world. The UK just gave them a billion dollar contract, the Ministry of Defense back in end of September, early October. So, that was very good to see. And obviously Palers's work with the government in the United States has continued to expand aggressively as more and more of what they're doing with the government becomes something that the government says, "Hey, you know, we need to be able to buy the software to uh work with."</p>
</details>

俄罗斯和乌克兰的局势显然导致许多其他国家认识到，也许是时候考虑一下，如果他们受到入侵或主权受到威胁，他们会怎么做？波兰副总理今天表示，因为那些威胁波兰的人知道我们拥有最好的数据处理系统，他们会在采取下一步行动之前三思。我认为这非常重要，因为归根结底，我对Palantir的看涨理由之一是，他们将成为西方的操作系统。他们不仅捍卫西方价值观，而且在捍卫西方价值观方面毫不妥协，这就是为什么Palantir从不向俄罗斯和中国出售产品。20年后，不与俄罗斯和中国合作似乎是明智之举，因为现在如果你与俄罗斯和中国合作，你会被视为一种负担，但Palantir一直是西方的坚定支持者，他们支持西方的思想、价值观和理念。因此，波兰只是Palantir理念的又一个延伸，即希望与那些主权可能受到威胁的国家合作，我认为这很有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Russia, Ukraine, obviously everything that's been going on has led to a lot of these other countries recognizing maybe it's time for us to potentially wonder if we were to get invaded or if our sovereignty was threatened, what would we do? And the Poland deputy prime minister today said because those who threaten Poland know that we have the best data processing system, they will think twice before taking the next step. I think this is really important because at the end of the day, one of my bull cases for Pounder was that they're going to become the operating system of the West. Not only do they defend Western values, not only are they unapologetic on the defense of Western values, which is why Palanteer is never sold to Russian China. 20 years later kind of made sense to not work with Russia and China because now if you work with Russia and China you're seen as a liability but Palanteer has been a a staunch supporter of of uh of the West and they've supported the ideas and values and concepts of the West. So Poland is just another extension of Palanter's philosophy in terms of wanting to work with countries that potentially could have their sovereignty threatened and I think it makes a lot of sense.</p>
</details>

我们知道Palantir显然一直在与他们在乌克兰、立陶宛所做的一切合作，卡普也提到了过去几年与许多亚洲政府的合作。特别是日本政府可能已经开始对Palantir的软件越来越感兴趣。我认为政府业务将继续增长，并且随着政府业务的持续增长，国际商业领域的扩张也将随之而来，顺便说一句，在英国，他们许多国际商业客户最初都是通过与国防部合作而获得的。我的意思是，如果你与一个国家的政府合作，那么向客户推销一笔交易确实会更容易。所以，我认为这更有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've known that Palanter has been obviously working with everything they've done in Ukraine, Lithuania, Kart mentioned, a lot of the Asian governments over the past couple years. The Japanese government in particular potentially has started to get more curious about Palanteer software. I think the government business is going to keep growing and as a result of the government business keep that that continues to grow. The international expansion into the commercial sector, which by the way in the United Kingdom, a lot of their international commercial customers came from beginning to work with the Ministry of Defense. I mean, it really is easier to, you know, sell a customer on a deal if you're working with the country's government. And so, I think that makes a lot more sense.</p>
</details>

现在，就股票而言，我一直在171、173美元买入，甚至在180美元也买入了。我从没想过我会说我在这些水平买入，但我只是在心里计算他们将实现的增长率。稍后我会做一期更深入的季度预览节目。嗯，我认为他们将增长超过50%。我认为他们将提高业绩指引。我认为营业利润率将继续增长。至少可以说，卡普对他们的增长方式和增长轨迹听起来相当兴奋。我并非对估值过高这一事实免疫。我明白这一点，我也明白我正在买入一家昂贵的公司，而且股价可能会下跌，这就是现实。但鉴于我持股已久，我也有相当不错的安全边际，坦率地说，有时你最好的投资想法就是你早期介入的那些。所以，我明白市值很高，但我也认为，在他们能够发布爆炸性财报之后，股价涨到200美元并非不可能，特别是因为这将继续向市场验证。没有其他软件公司能以超过50%的速度增长。没有其他利用AI的软件公司能以50%的速度增长，并拥有Palantir这样的利润率。顺便说一句，他们的收入具有粘性，这与市场背景无关，但一旦他们锁定你，他们就会锁定你，并且这种效应会持续复合。所以，根据“80法则”（Rule of 80: 衡量软件公司增长和盈利能力的指标，通常指营收增长率与自由现金流利润率之和），我认为这将是一个不错的季度。我不知道这只股票会发生什么。我上周确实逢低买入了，是的，恭喜大家。Palantir创下历史新高，下周财报公布时，我们将继续关注这个故事如何发展。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, in terms of the stock, look, I've been buying at 171, 173, even at 180 I bought. I I I never thought I I would say I'm buying at these levels, but I'm kind of just doing the math in my head on the growth rate that they're going to put up. And I'll do a more in-depth counter preview episode later. Um, I think they're going to grow more than 50%. I think they're going to increase guidance. I think operating margins are going to continue to grow. Karp has sounded pretty excited to say the least about how they're growing and where their trajectory of growth is. I am not immune to the fact that the valuation is aggressive. I understand that and I understand I'm buying into an expensive company and that the stock could fall and it is what it is. But I also have a pretty nice margin of safety given I've been in the stock for a long time and quite frankly sometimes your best ideas are the ideas that you got into early. And so I understand the market cap is elevated, but I also think that a run to 200 is not crazy after a bombastic earnings that they can deliver, especially because it will continue to validate to the street. There is no other software company that is growing more than 50%. There's no other software company utilizing AI that's growing 50% with the margins that Paltor has. By the way, sticky revenue, not really contextual to the market, but once they lock you in, they lock you in and that continues to compound. So with a rule of 80, I think this is going to be a good quarter. I don't know what happens to the stock. I did buy the dip last week and yeah, congratulations to everyone. Alltime highs on pounder and we will get to continue seeing how the story unfolds as we get into earnings going into next week.</p>

### 宏观市场：贸易协议、降息与市场健康

好的，我们来谈谈宏观经济，因为宏观世界正在发生很多事情。首先，过去24小时我们看到的市场大涨是由什么引起的？这个问题的答案在于**珍妮特·耶伦**（Janet Yellen: 美国财政部长）周末的讲话。美国财政部长珍妮特·耶伦说了什么？嗯，她在马来西亚与中国贸易部长李（Li）及其代表举行了会议。会谈进行得非常好。我的意思是，除了稀土矿物和金属之外，我们没有得到太多关于会谈的具体细节。顺便说一句，今天这些股票下跌的原因是，中美之间的紧张关系似乎没有那么激烈。所以，讽刺的是，稀土公司的国内生产商并没有那么稀有。因此，如果我们继续从中国进口，那么至少在短期内，对于像**MP Materials**（MP Materials Corp: 一家美国稀土生产商）或**USA Rare Earth**等公司的高估值，我们可能不会有那么大的需求。所以，在出口管制和贸易谈判方面，出口不再是那么大的问题。耶伦表示，我们有一个有意义的框架能够与中方进行接触，并且正在安排11月1日**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）和**习近平**（Xi Jinping: 中国国家主席）在韩国的会晤。如果这次会晤进展顺利，那么市场可能会对贸易协议进行定价。所以，我认为这就是为什么过去24小时我们过得如此愉快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's talk macro because we got a lot of stuff going on in the world of macro. First of all, what caused the bright green that we saw uh over the past 24 hours? And the answer to that question lies in what Scott Bent said over the weekend. What does Scott Bent say, the US Treasury Secretary? Well, he was in Malaysia with a meeting uh with President uh not the president but the prime minister of trade in and their representative Lee in China or from China. And the conversations were really good. I mean we didn't get that many specifics on the conversations outside of the fact that the rare earth minerals and metals which by the way the reason why those stocks declined today is because it looks like the China tensions are not that aggressive. So the domestic producers of the rare earth companies are not that rare ironically. And so uh if we're going to keep exporting from China then you know we might not have that much demand at least in the short term for the elevated valuations for some of those other companies like an MP or a US AR etc. So uh the exports is not that big of a deal anymore in terms of export controls trade negotiations. Bas said we have a meaningful framework to be able to engage with the Chinese and it is setting up the November 1st meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea and if that meeting goes well then the markets are potentially going to be pricing at a trade deal. So, I think this is why we've had some fun over the past 24 hours.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，**S&P 500**指数再次下跌，10月10日我们下跌3%的原因是特朗普关于中国的推文。坦率地说，在过去24小时我一直在思考，我认为这并非真正因为那条推文。我认为市场需要一个催化剂。而那个催化剂最终就是那条推文。由于那条推文，股票终于得到了喘息的机会，而在8月份它们并没有喘息。9月份也没有。整个夏天都没有。上一次它们真正喘息是在4月份，当时我们经历了2%的下跌。直到10月10日，我们才经历了那次下跌，这中间隔了五个月。那么，这对更广泛的市场意味着什么呢？周三将有降息。周三我几乎会全天直播，所以那将是重要的一天。嗯，我们不知道是否会降息，但有大约97%的可能性会降息。周三还有盈利增长。我们还有**微软**（Microsoft: 一家科技巨头）、**谷歌**（Google: 一家科技巨头）和**Meta**（Meta Platforms: Facebook的母公司）。我不知道我们如何在收盘时处理这些，但我们有所有这些公司的财报。所以，我们会关注这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the S&P 500 again, the reason we took that 3% draw down on October 10th is because of the Trump China tweet. And quite frankly, as I've been thinking about it over the past 24 hours, I think it's not really because of that tweet. I think the market needed a catalyst. And that catalyst ended up being that tweet. And as a result of that tweet, you had the windfall of stocks finally taking a breather, which in August they didn't take a breather. In September, they didn't take a breather. In the summer, they didn't take a breather. The last time they took a breather literally was April when we had a 2% down day. It was five months until we had that draw down until October 10th. Now, what does this mean for the broader market? You've got rate cuts coming up on Wednesday. I'll be live pretty much all day on Wednesday, so that's going to be a massive day. Um, we don't know if we're getting rate cuts, but there's like a 97% chance we're getting rate cuts. You have earnings growth Wednesday. We also have Microsoft, Google, and Meta. I don't know how we're going to manage that on the market close, but we've got all those earnings. So, we'll be taking a look at that.</p>
</details>

嗯，所以大型科技公司即将公布盈利增长。到目前为止，整体财报表现都相当不错。我们上周谈过这一点。你有即将到来的降息，然后还有数万亿美元的场外资金。如果财报继续表现良好，这些资金很可能会希望在股市中获得一些敞口。更不用说，**S&P 500**指数也曾下跌3%。所以，个股遭受了10%到15%的打击。但那只是像**Robinhood**（Robinhood Markets: 一家美国金融服务公司）和**Nuvei**（Nuvei: 一家全球支付技术公司）这样的好公司，它们已经开始很好地复苏。那些基本面不太稳健的公司。我并不是说它们是坏公司。我只是客观地说，当你没有任何盈利和收入，却获得了200亿到300亿美元的市值时，问题是为什么？到底是什么创造了所有这些势头，所有这些资本流入公司本身？是炒作吗？是一个故事吗？还是说，未来会有巨大的盈利增长预期？市场希望将这种预期提前，顺便说一句，市场对特斯拉就是这样做的。只是特斯拉也有千亿美元的收入和400亿美元的现金。市场对**苹果**（Apple: 一家科技巨头）也是如此。只是苹果回购了1000亿美元的股票，而且它是苹果。它是这个星球上最重要的公司之一。所以看到这些小公司获得如此高的估值，然后又经历了相当大的回调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, so you got earnings growth that's coming up from the big tech companies. So far, earnings have been pretty good across the board. We talked about that last week. You've got rate cuts coming and then you got trillions of dollars on the sideline. That is likely going to want to get some exposure to what's going on in the stock market if the earnings continue to do well. Not to mention, you also had a draw down of 3% on the S&P 500. So, individual names took, you know, a 10 to 15% hit. But that was just the good companies like a Robin and a Nebius, which have started to recover very well. the companies that aren't as fundamentally sound. And I'm not saying they're bad companies. I'm not saying they're they're piles of I I am just saying objectively like when you don't have any earnings and revenue and you're getting a, you know, 20 30 billion dollar market cap. The question is why? Like really, what is out there that's creating all this momentum, all this capital flowing into the the company itself, is it hype? Is it a narrative? Or is it the idea that there will be projected massive earnings growth in the future? And the street wants to pull that forward, which by the way, the street does that on Tesla. It's just Tesla also does hundred billion dollars in revenue and has 40 billion in cash. The street does that with Apple. It's just that Apple buys back $100 billion dollars of stock and it's Apple. It's one of the most important companies on the planet. So seeing these smaller companies get these multiples and then get a draw down that has been pretty aggressive.</p>
</details>

我上周说过，我并不是想听起来像一个希望这些公司失败的人。我没有做空。我没有买入看跌期权。诸如此类都没有。这些公司下跌并不会让我的生活变得更好。我只是认为，作为一个广泛的市场参与者，看到一些股票失去一些泡沫是健康的，而且我认为很多人都同意这一点，因为当泡沫存在于系统中时，问题在于它会扰乱整个市场。现在，这可能不会对**英伟达**（Nvidia: 一家图形处理器和AI芯片公司）、**亚马逊**（Amazon: 一家电商和云计算巨头）以及所有其他公司产生影响，但问题是当市场出现如此多的狂热和兴奋时，我们在过去一百年的股市中一次又一次地看到，往往会出现大规模的回调。当过多的资金追逐过多的投机时，这种投机就会导致灾难。所以，我认为过去几周发生的事情，实际上是非常健康的，那就是很多投机行为都被冲走了。其中一些股票可能永远无法回到历史高点。有些可能会。还有一些正在复苏。比如**Okta**（Okta: 一家身份管理公司），股价一度跌至118美元。我认为它今天收于137美元。它的历史高点是195美元。即使在137美元，它今年迄今仍上涨了500%。所以，除非你在195美元的高点或短期高点买入，否则我想没有人会抱怨持有Okta。这就是那种你买入价格非常高的情况。**MP Materials**也是一样，对吧？如果你在95美元买入一家稀土公司，现在它跌到60美元，这就像，你有点追涨了，这种势头出现回调是可以接受的。

<p class="english-text">I said it last week and I I I don't mean to sound like someone who wants these companies to fail. I have no shorts. I have no puts. Nothing like that. It doesn't really make my life better if these companies go down. I just think as a as as a broad market participant, it is healthy and I think many people agree with this to see some of these names lose some of the froth because when that froth is in the system, the problem is it messes up the entire market. Now, it likely won't have an impact on Nvidia and Amazon and all these other companies, but the problem is when there's that much euphoria and excitement, we've seen this happen over and over again over the past hundred years in the stock market, you tend to get massive drawdowns. As too much money finds too much speculation, that speculation leads to disaster. So, what I think has happened over the past couple weeks, which is actually very healthy, is that a lot of that speculation came down the drain. Some of those stocks might never get back to all-time highs. Some of them might. And some of them are recovering. Like Oaklo, for example, went all the way down to 118. I think it closed today at 137. Its all-time high was 195. And at 137, it's still up 500% year to date. So, it's not like I think anyone's complaining about the fact that they're an Oaklo unless you bought at 195, which is, you know, if you bought at the top or at the short-term top. It's just one of those things where, you know, you bought really high. Same thing with MP Materials, right? If you bought a rare earth company at 95 bucks and now it's at 60, it's like, you know, you kind of bought into the momentum and it is okay for that momentum to have a draw down.</p>
</details>

**S&P 500**指数回到了历史高点。谷歌也创下了历史新高。亚马逊正试图冲向历史新高。许多股票已经复苏，但对我来说，这种“并非完全复苏”的状态对更广泛的市场，即牛市可以健康持续的理念来说是非常健康的，因为你看到泡沫正在被挤出。这没关系。再次强调，这并不是说这些公司不好。也不是说这些公司未来不会成功。只是说这些公司还没有实现盈利增长。不幸的是，如果它们不继续实现盈利增长（我们即将迎来财报季），而且如果你没有看到这些公司中的任何一家有真正良好稳健的盈利，我认为市场现在处于一种“嘿，我们不会容忍这种模式”的状态。比如，这些公司可能什么都拿不出来，只是说：“嘿，再给我们几个季度，它就来了”，市场对此也无所谓。但我认为市场也会想，老兄，谷歌有1150亿美元的利润，但它的**市盈率**（P/E: Price-to-Earnings Ratio，股价与每股收益之比）仍然没有达到30倍。谷歌今天确实创下了历史新高。我们为什么要买那些只承诺未来收入的公司呢？坦率地说，市场并没有买账。很多散户正在买入这些股票，但很多散户可能会开始意识到，为什么我不买英伟达、Palantir和特斯拉这些公司呢？你知道，即使这些公司可以说估值很高，但它们是真实、合法的公司，正在实现盈利。我可以不同意它们的估值倍数，但我不能不同意它们不值得拥有一个估值倍数的事实。

<p class="english-text">Fact that the S&P 500 is back to all-time highs. Google's at all-time highs. Amazon's trying to push all-time highs. And they've got a lot of these names that have recovered but not really recovered to me is very healthy for the broader for the broader like idea that the bull market can be healthy and continue because you're seeing that froth get taken out. And that is okay. And again, it's not to say these are bad companies. It's not to say these companies can't succeed in the future. It's just to say these companies haven't put up the earnings growth. And unfortunately, if they don't continue to put up any earnings growth, which we have earnings coming up, and you know, if you just don't see really good solid earnings from any of these companies, I think the market is now in this, hey, we're not going to tolerate this type of mode. Like, maybe these companies can put up nothing and just say, hey, give us another couple quarters, it's coming, and the market's okay with that. But I think the market's also like, dude, Google's doing 115 billion of profits and Google still doesn't trade at a 30 times PE. Google did hit an all-time high today. Why are we buying this that is promising us revenue in the future? And quite frankly, the market's not buying this. It's a lot of retail that's buying this, but a lot of retail might start to recognize, why am I not buying Nvidia, Palenteer, and Tesla, and these, you know, even though those companies, you could say, have aggressive multiples, they are real, legit companies that are putting up earnings. I can disagree with the multiple, but I can't disagree with the fact that they don't deserve a multiple.</p>

所以我认为我们目前所处的市场状况是：如果美联储即将降息，我们有盈利增长，中美紧张关系可能正在解决，世界各地有更多的地缘政治稳定，并且很多投机动能已经被清除。再次强调，我之所以反复强调这一点，是因为理解2021年出现了一个**迷因股ETF**（Meme Stock ETF: 投资于社交媒体上热门投机股票的交易所交易基金），那正是市场的顶峰，非常非常高的顶峰，非常重要。然后到2023年中期，在2022年熊市**S&P 500**指数下跌19%之后，那个迷因股ETF就消失了。几周前发生的事情让你们很多人感到恐慌。迷因股ETF又回来了。这也让我感到恐慌，因为作为一个关心牛市健康的人，我心想，兄弟，如果有一个真正的ETF可以交易迷因股，并且它获得了大量的交易量，这意味着有很多人准备追逐越来越多的股票。我的意思是，字面上看，股票代码**ASST**今天上涨了50%，因为一个拥有20万粉丝的人在推特上提到了它。再次，当市场中发生这些事情时，我认为大多数至少在过去五年里经历过一个周期的人都知道，这不是世界上最好的迹象。所以，看到这些泡沫消退，市场继续创下历史新高，我认为这令人难以置信。如果那些公司能拿出好的财报，它们可能会再次获得高估值，或者通过增长来配得上它们的估值，因为它们值得。如果它们做不到，那它们就不会得到，这没关系。如果英伟达没有实现增长，英伟达也不会获得高估值，股市就应该这样。如果你不能增长，如果像我喜欢并认为明年能涨到10美元的**Grab**（Grab Holdings: 一家东南亚科技公司）不能实现盈利增长，它们就不应该获得高估值。

<p class="english-text">And so I think the state of the markets that we're in right now is that if we have Fed cuts coming, we have earnings growth, we have China tensions that are potentially getting resolved, we have more geopolitical stability across the world, and we have a lot of the momentum that has been taken out. Again, the reason I'm harping on this point, it's very important to understand in 2021, we had a meme stock ETF come out that was the top. It was the tippy top. And then by the end of uh or by mid 2023 after the 2022 uh bare market 19% draw down on the S&P that meme stock ETF went away. What happened a couple weeks ago that freaked a lot of you guys out. The meme stock ETF came back. And it freaked me out too because you know as someone who cares about the health of the bull market I'm just like bro like if if there's a literal ETF where you could trade meme stocks and it's getting a ton of trading volume that means there's a lot of people ready to chase more and more names. I mean, literally, ticker symbol ASST went up 50% today because someone with 200,000 followers tweeted about it. Again, when you have those things happening in the market, and I think most people that have been around at least for the past five years, even if you've only been through one cycle, you you you you know that's not the best sign in the world. So, to see that froth come away and come down and the market continue to make a new all-time high, I think is incredible. And if those names put up good earnings, they will probably get their multiples again or grow into their multiples because they deserve it. they don't then they won't which is fine if Nvidia doesn't put up the growth Nvidia doesn't get a multiple either and and that's how it should be in the stock market if you can't grow if Grab which I love and I think can break out to $10 by next year if they can't put up the earnings growth they should not get a multiple</p>
</details>

所以我认为我们正处于一个相对健康的市场中，我知道很多听众中的看空者可能会因为我这样说而生气，但我确实认为，动能的回调以及人们被迫自问“我为什么持有这些股票？”（无论你持有哪只股票，每个人都必须这样做，下跌会迫使你思考这是否是一家值得持有的基本面公司）——这就是过去几周发生的事情。经历了这些痛苦之后，你现在能够看到一些收益。所以我认为过去两周是一个相对强劲的周期。11月平均而言往往是全年表现最好的月份，到年底平均上涨约4.5%。所以我认为我们正在进入一个好时期，如果能有这些财报和降息，只会继续推动牛市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think we're in a market that is relatively healthy and you know a lot of the bears that are listening to this are probably going to get mad at me for saying this but I do think that the draw down of momentum and people forcing themselves to ask themselves why do I own these names which everyone has to do regardless of whatever name you own like it forces you in a draw down to say is this a fundamental company I deserve to own that is what's been happening over the past couple weeks and as a result of going through those pains where you're able to now see some gains and so I think it has been a relatively strong cycle over the past two weeks November tends to be the best month of the year on average up about four and a half% going into the end of the year so I think we are entering into a good time and if we can get these earnings and rate cuts that should only continue to propel the bull market</p>

### 特斯拉：自动驾驶与AI实体化

好的，特斯拉，我们来谈谈特斯拉。我们收到了一些关于特斯拉的相当不错的更新。**Canaccord Genuity**（Canaccord Genuity: 一家全球性金融服务公司）将目标股价上调至510美元。以下是他们的说法：“特斯拉披露，其**CyberCab**（特斯拉自动驾驶出租车项目）、**Semi**（特斯拉电动卡车）和**Mega Pack 3**（特斯拉大型储能系统）的批量生产都按计划在2026财年进行，我们认为这意义重大。最后，特斯拉还披露，预计明年**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，资本性支出，指用于购买、改进或维护固定资产的费用）将大幅增加。总体而言，我们对特斯拉的中长期前景保持乐观，并继续看到能源存储和部署、**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 特斯拉完全自动驾驶系统）、**RoboTaxi**（自动驾驶出租车）、CyberCab、Semi以及**Optimus Bots**（特斯拉人形机器人）带来的巨大未来上行空间。我们维持增持评级，并将目标股价从355美元上调至510美元。”这是Canaccord Genuity相当大的一个评级上调。他们基本上是在押注RoboTaxi和FSD的故事将在2026年开始实现，我认为他们会是对的。我不知道这会对盈利产生多大影响，但我们可能会看到更多实际交易等方面的进展，即使盈利催化剂要到2027年才出现。所以，这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay Tessy let's talk about Tessy We got some pretty good updates in the world of Tesla. Caner Fitzgerald raised the price target to 510. Here's what they said. Tesla disclosed that volume production of its Cyber Cap, Semi and Mega Pack 3 are all on track for fiscal year 2026, which we see is significant. Lastly, Tesla also disclosed that it expects a significant increase in capex for next year. Overall, we remain bullish on Tesla over the medium to long-term, and we continue to see meaningful future upside from energy storage and deployment, FSD, RoboCap, Cyber, Robo Taxi, CyberCab, Semis, and Optimus Bots. We maintained our overweight rating and recently increased our price target from 355 to 510. That's a pretty big upgrade from Cancer Fitzgerald. They're basically betting on the robo taxis and FSD story starting to materialize in 2026, which I think they're going to be right about. I don't know how much that impacts earnings, but we will see some like more probably progress on like actual deals and things of that nature even if the earnings catalyst is in uh 2027. So, that's really important.</p>
</details>

然后是**摩根士丹利**（Morgan Stanley: 一家全球性金融服务公司）的**亚当·乔纳斯**（Adam Jonas），他长期以来一直是特斯拉的分析师，他说：“我敢断言，自动驾驶汽车问题已解决。我指的是小数点后六七个‘九’吗？不是。完美？永无止境。但足以在大城市大规模取消安全驾驶员。”以下是他的说法：“根据我们与特斯拉的讨论，似乎唯一阻止特斯拉取消驾驶员的是其自身过度的谨慎。我们的理解是，在德克萨斯州取消驾驶员不需要明确的监管批准。一个纯被动光学**自动驾驶**（AV: Autonomous Vehicle，自动驾驶车辆）系统将严重挑战RoboTaxi社区中许多人的传统思维。特斯拉坚信雷达和激光雷达并不能使其汽车更安全。我们长期以来的观点是，如果你解决了汽车的自动驾驶问题，你就解决了许多其他AI赋能机器人形态的自动驾驶问题。”所以，很多华尔街人士都出来说：“看，我们知道盈利并不那么令人印象深刻。我们知道他们同比负增长30%，但特斯拉是机器人和FSD领域物理AI的体现。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you've got um Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas who's been a Tesla analyst for a long time saying, "I'm calling it. Autonomous cars are solved. Do I mean six or seven nines to the right of the decimal? No. Perfection? Never. But enough to pull the safety driver at scale in major metros." Here's what he said. From our discussions with Tesla, it appears the only thing preventing Tesla from pulling a driver in its own abundance of caution. Our understanding is that there is no explicit regulatory approval required to pull drivers in Texas. A passive optical only AV system would seriously challenge the conventional thinking of many in the robo taxi community. Tesla truly believes that the radar and ligard do not make its cars any safer. It is our long-standing opinion that if you solve autonomy for cars, you solve autonomy for many of the other form factors of AI enabled robotics.</p>
</details>

我还没有尝试过FSD14。我确实需要下载它。我知道**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk: 特斯拉首席执行官）说过现在任何人都有机会使用和下载它。所以，我很期待使用它。但是，我的意思是，FSD真的非常棒。我目前使用的13.2.9版本似乎没有变得更糟。所以，嗯，我认为这个论点从这个角度来看确实很有道理。如果你真的解决了自动驾驶问题，你可能也就解决了AI更广泛的含义，这些问题最终需要在物理AI的其他方面，比如人形机器人方面得到解决。那么特斯拉的问题就变成了：盈利能力从何而来？我不认为明年会是能源业务，除非特斯拉真的表现得非常出色。但再说一次，这并不是盈利增长的重要组成部分。我不认为会是FSD，除非他们卖出大量的汽车。我知道利率正在下降，但问题是，如果电动汽车补贴消失了，这是否足以让人们购买汽车，从而让他们有机会选择FSD？所以，然后我也不认为2026年是Optimus。那么问题就变成了RoboTaxi，正如亚当·乔纳斯所说，如果他们能在奥斯汀取消驾驶员，那将非常有帮助，因为现在它就像一个合法的RoboTaxi网络。如果他们能扩展到加利福尼亚、内华达、纽约等地，那将是一件大事，就像**Waymo**（Waymo: 谷歌旗下的自动驾驶技术公司）正在扩张一样。只是特斯拉的扩张以及与竞争对手相比拥有差异化的FSD形式的能力将非常重要。所以我认为这实际上是2026年的催化剂。如果你对特斯拉感到兴奋，你真的需要RoboTaxi开始规模化，也许2026年还不是时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you've got a lot of these Wall Street guys coming out and saying, "Look, we know the earnings aren't that impressive. We know they're growing negative 30% year-over-year, but Tesla is the manifestation of physical AI when it comes to robots and FSD. I haven't tried FSD14 yet. I do have to download it. I know Elon said anyone has the chance now to use it and download it. So, I'm excited to use it. But, I mean, FSD is pretty damn good. 13.2.9 that I'm on doesn't seem like it's getting any worse. And so, uh I think the argument actually makes a lot of sense from this perspective. If you do solve autonomy, you probably solve the broader implications around AI that uh eventually are going to need to be solved in regards to things like, you know, other elements of physical AI like humanoid robotics. The question then becomes for Tesla. Where does the earnings power come from? And I don't think it's energy next year unless Tesla really blows it out the water. But again, that's just not a significant part of the earnings growth. I don't think it's FSD unless they sell a ton of cars. And I know rates are coming down, but you know, the question is if that EV incentive is gone, is that going to be enough to get people to buy the cars which will allow them to even have a chance to opt into FSD? So then the real and then I don't think it's optimist in 26. So then the question becomes robo taxi and as Adam Jonas says if they can get rid of the driver in Austin then that really becomes helpful because now it's like a legit robo taxi network. If they can expand to California, Nevada, New York, etc. that would be a big deal like Whimo's expanding. It's just the Tesla expansion along with the ability to have a differentiated form of FSD compared to some of the competitors would be very important. So I think that's actually the catalyst for 2026. If you're excited about Tesla, you really need robo taxi to begin to scale and maybe 26 is not the year.</p>
</details>

但看起来，你知道，即使根据今天RoboTaxi或特斯拉股价跳空高开的走势，盘后交易中达到了455美元。我的意思是，我认为它之所以这样做，即使在财报日它曾触及418美元，仅仅是基于市场知道这是至少在物理领域获得AI敞口的最佳方式。你知道，你有英伟达，你有资本支出建设，你有谷歌、亚马逊等等。特斯拉正在追求“登月计划”（moonshot），如果他们能成功执行这个计划，而且埃隆·马斯克非常有动力，因为如果他成功了，他将获得一万亿美元，这对特斯拉来说并非最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it looks like and you know even based on the price action with robo taxi or with Tesla gapping up today, look at that 455 in the after hours. I mean I think the reason it's doing that even it touched 418 back on the earnings day is simply based on the idea that the street knows this is the best way to get exposure to AI at least in the physical realm. You know you got Nvidia, you got the capex build out, you got Google, Amazon, etc. Tesla is going for the moonshot and if they can execute on the moonshot and Elon's very incentivized because he'll get a trillion dollars if he does that would not be the worst thing in the world for Tesla.</p>
</details>

### 公司更新：Robinhood、Google与Qualcomm

好的，最后三项更新，然后我们今天就结束了。首先，**Compass Point**（Compass Point Research & Trading: 一家金融服务公司）将**Robinhood**的评级从105美元上调至161美元。这与过去几周它获得的许多其他评级上调非常相似，都进入了140到160美元的区间。分析师基本上表示，我们对第三季度**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 息税折旧摊销前利润）的预测比市场预期高出6%，并且我们正在上调2026年的**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share）。他们承认Robinhood的交易价格存在溢价。他们的论点是，如果Robinhood能继续超出预期，那么这种溢价就是合理的，因此他们继续上调目标股价。Robinhood几乎回到了150美元。今天收于146美元。曾达到149美元。所以再次，这又回到了我关于像Robinhood这样优质公司从150美元跌到120美元的观点。它们经历了一次动能回调，这是好事。我不认为Robinhood真的值得在一周半内涨到150美元，我这样说，是因为我持有超过1万股Robinhood的股票。我热爱这家公司，但从健康的角度来看，我知道这必须在催化剂和盈利增长的推动下自然发生，而不仅仅是为了好玩，因为那样它就会变成一个迷因。我对投资迷因股不感兴趣。我五年前做过，结果亏了钱。我相信很多人也有同感。我希望它能更自然地发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, last three updates right here and then we will be done for the day. First of all, Robin got an upgrade from uh 105 to 161 by Compass Point. Very similar to a lot of the other upgrades it's been getting over the past couple weeks into that 140 to 160 range. And essentially the analyst said our 3Qbida forecast is 6% above the street and we are raising our 2026 EPS. They acknowledge that Robin Hood trades at a premium. Their argument is if Robin Hood can continue beating expectations, then that premium is justified and as a result, they continue to raise their price target. Robin Hood almost back to 150. It closed at 146 today. Got to 149. So again, this goes back to my point about quality companies like the Hood from 150 to 120. They had a momentum shakeddown which was good. I don't think Robin Hood really deserved to get to 150 in a week, which is, you know, it would be a week and a half, which again, I say this as someone who has more than 10,000 shares of Robin Hood. I I I love the company, but I also know from a health perspective, this thing needs to happen naturally with catalyst, with earnings growth, not just for the hell of it, because then it becomes a meme. And I'm not interested in investing in memes. I did that 5 years ago, got burned. I'm sure a lot of people feel the same. I want it to actually be more natural.</p>
</details>

所以Robinhood跌到120美元，让很多因为错误原因进入市场的“弱手”出局，并吸引真正的逢低买家入场，同时有更多的催化剂，比如**S&P 500**指数继续表现良好，加密货币继续表现良好，然后临近财报季。这样更多的人就会关注他们实际能拿出什么样的数字。这就是为什么它值得回到历史高点。然后，如果他们能交出亮眼的财报，他们就值得继续扩大估值倍数。但他们必须拿出亮眼的财报。他们必须展示出来。我认为那也将是最重要的事情。**Nuvei**也是一样，它从140美元跌到96美元，现在又回升到125美元。许多受打击的公司正在卷土重来，但它们是带着报复性地回来。它们不仅仅是为了回来而回来。而那些真正受到重创的公司，虽然有所回升，但如果没有基本面支撑，它们可能不会持续回升。所以，Robinhood的这次评级上调非常好。我认为我们会看到更多这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so Robin Hood falling to 120, getting a lot of the weak hands out of the system that you know got into it for the wrong reasons and getting actual dip buyers to come in and having more of a catalyst aka S&P 500 continuing to do well, crypto continuing to do well and then getting closer to earnings. So more people are, you know, looking at what numbers they could actually put up. That is why it deserves to get back to alltime highs. And then if they can crush earnings, they deserve to continue expanding their multiple. But they got to crush earnings. They've got to show it off. And I I think that's going to be the most important thing as well. Same thing for Nebius, which fell from 140 to 96, now recovering back to 125. A lot of these companies that got hit are starting to come back, but they're coming back with a vengeance. They're not just coming back for the hell of coming back. And the companies that really got hit badly uh are coming back a little bit, but if there's no fundamentals, they might not continue to come back. So, that was a really good upgrade on Robin. I think we'll see more of them.</p>
</details>

谷歌的目标股价被上调至300美元。嗯，**Anthropic**（Anthropic: 一家AI安全和研究公司）将购买一百万个**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌开发的用于机器学习的专用集成电路），这是谷歌的定制芯片。我的意思是，谷歌现在是一家3.1万亿美元的公司。对于那些在今年150美元买入并忽略了市场噪音的人，请给自己一个赞。我的意思是，你绝对值得这些收益。而且谷歌看起来并没有放缓脚步。如果到年底它的股价能达到300美元，那将是四个月内从150美元到300美元的翻倍。所以，谷歌仍然是“七巨头”（Magnificent Seven）中表现最好的公司之一。它是表现第二好的“七巨头”股票，今年迄今上涨37%，较4月低点上涨80%。并且它继续获得市场的评级上调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google got upgraded to 300. Uh Anthropic is going to be buying a million more TPUs, which are Google's custom chips. I mean, Google now $3.1 trillion company. For those that bought at 150 during the year and you ignored the noise, give yourself a pat on the back. I mean, you absolutely deserve the gains. And Google doesn't look like they're slowing down. If this thing has a three handle on it by the end of the year, it would uh be essentially a double from 150 to 300 in four months. So, Google continues to be one of the best Mac 7 names. It is the second best Mac performing name, up 37% year-to date and 80% from the April lows. and it continues to get upgraded by the street.</p>
</details>

嗯，最后两项更新，关于谷歌的最后一件事。谷歌正式购买核电。**彭博社**（Bloomberg: 一家全球性商业、金融信息和新闻公司）今天报道称，**NextEra Energy**（NextEra Energy: 一家美国能源公司，股票代码NE）计划重启爱荷华州的一座核电站，而谷歌正在竞标购买该核电。所以，再次强调，数据中心能源股。我们将在年底前对能源股进行更多深入研究，但我确实认为2026年将是一个以能源为主题的年份。谷歌看起来将开始购买更多核电。他们开始在印度投资150亿美元。上周他们表示，对于数据中心来说，能源肯定会是重点。现在有很多能源股在我看来有点贵。所以我正在努力寻找能源股中的真正价值。**Enphase Energy**（Enphase Energy: 一家能源技术公司）也是我认为很多人应该关注的股票。嗯，我前段时间在Twitter Spaces上讨论过它。我会把音频版本放在描述里，供想听的人收听。但那家公司更多是做电池生产的。对能源来说仍然很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, last two updates, one last thing on Google. Google's officially purchasing nuclear power. Bloomberg is reporting today that Next Era Energy, NE, ticker symbol, plans to restart a nuclear power plant in Iowa, and Google is uh competing to be the bidder for that nuclear power. So, again, the data center energy names. We're going to do a lot more of deep dives into energy stocks going into the end of the year, but I do think that 2026 will be an energy fuel theme. And Google looks like they're going to start to buy more nuclear power. They started investing $15 billion in India. Last week they said for data centers definitely looks like energy is going to be there. Now there's a lot of energy names that are a bit expensive in my opinion. So I'm trying to look for the real value in the energy names. ENS is a the stock that I think a lot of people should look at as well. Uh I did a Twitter spaces on that a while ago. I'll put that in the description for those that want to hear the audio version of it. But that one's more in battery production. Still important for energy.</p>
</details>

最后一项更新。**高通**（Qualcomm: 一家半导体和电信设备公司）长期来看有空间产生可观的**AI推理**（AI Inference: 人工智能推理，指AI模型利用已学习到的知识对新数据进行预测或决策的过程）相关收入。**Rosenblatt**（Rosenblatt Securities: 一家独立股票研究和交易公司）给予其225美元的买入目标价。高通是很多人都听说过的公司之一，但如果你今天在市场开盘时关注，你会看到这只股票跳空高开20%。最终收盘时仅上涨11%。从205美元跌至187美元。基本上，他们推出了几款新芯片，人们认为它们是英伟达和**AMD**（Advanced Micro Devices: 一家半导体公司）的竞争对手。Rosenblatt表示：“我们认为今天的公告对高通股票的长期发展是积极的。多年来，管理层的策略一直是实现终端市场多元化，同时提高智能手机市场份额。与**Human**（Human: 一家公司或项目）达成200兆瓦的部署协议是非常好的一步。这发生在沙特阿拉伯。在AI推理数据中心领域，这是一个新的增长方向。提醒一下，今年5月，AMD和Human宣布了一项价值100亿美元的500兆瓦部署协议。尽管尚未提供收入细节，但我们预计高通与Human的部署可能产生20亿美元的收入。部署预计将于2026年开始。到2030年，推理阶段的AI市场预计将达到2500亿美元，并以每年20%的速度增长。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Final update right here. There is room for Qualcomm to generate significant AI inference related revenue longterm. Rosenlat gives them a buy target at 225. Now Qualcomm is one of those names that I'm sure a lot of people have heard about, but today if you were live in the market open, you saw this bad boy gap up 20%. End of the day up only 11%. Went from 205 to 187. Essentially, they introduced a couple new chips and people thought they were competitors to Nvidia and AMD. Uh Rosenlat said, "We view today's announcement as a positive for the Qualcomm shares for the longer term. For years, management strategy has been to diversify its end markets while growing its smartphone market share. Landing a 200 megawatt deployment with Human is a very good step. This is in Saudi Arabia. In a new growth vector in AI inference data centers, as a reminder, in May this year, AMD and Human announced a 500 megawatt deployment worth 10 billion. While revenue details have not been provided, we expect Qualcomm's deployment with human to generate potentially two billion in revenue. Deployment is expected to start in 26. Inference stage AI market is expected to be 250 billion by 2030 and growing 20% annually.</p>
</details>

我会尝试更深入地研究高通到底发生了什么，但看起来这些新芯片确实引发了一些问题，比如：它们能否从AMD和英伟达那里夺取一些市场份额？我认为老牌公司有巨大的生存市场，但你可能有一个Rosenblatt看好的新玩家。其他一些半导体分析师则认为，这并不能真正取代**MI450**（AMD Instinct MI450: AMD的AI加速器产品线中的一个型号）或**Blackwell**（Nvidia Blackwell: 英伟达下一代GPU架构）。嗯，但很高兴看到越来越多的半导体公司加入竞争，并继续证明AI资本支出建设并未放缓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to try to dig a little deeper into what the heck's going on with Qualcomm, but it does seem like, you know, these new chips bring up some questions of, hey, can they potentially take some market share from the AMDs, Nvidas of the world? I think there's a massive market for old companies to survive, but you potentially have a new player that Rosenlat is bullish on. Some of the other semiconductor analysts are like, well, this is not really replacing the MI450 or Blackwell. Uh, but it's nice to see more and more semiconductor companies getting into the mix and continuing to prove that the AI capex buildout is not slowing down.</p>
</details>

### 结语
