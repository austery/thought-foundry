### 公司业绩与市场反应

Bloomberg: All right, folks. Levi Strauss shares are trading slightly lower today after dropping as much as 14% on Friday. This is after the company's upgraded earnings guidance still fell short of higher investor expectations following the stock's more than 40% rally heading into that earnings print. Now, one key disappointment, at least according to analysts out on the street, is earnings growth failing to match the pace of sales expansion due to **tariffs** (Tariffs: 国家对进出口商品征收的税费) and distribution costs. Meanwhile, I've got to say Bailey, TD Cowen raised its price target on the stock to $26 from $22 a share, and they've got their buy rating.

Bloomberg: 各位观众，好。李维斯 (Levi Strauss) 股价今天小幅走低，此前周五曾下跌高达 14%。这是因为该公司上调后的盈利指引仍未能达到投资者更高的预期，此前该股在财报发布前已上涨超过 40%。目前，至少根据市场分析师的说法，一个主要的失望点是，由于**关税**（Tariffs: 国家对进出口商品征收的税费）和分销成本，盈利增长未能与销售扩张的速度相匹配。与此同时，贝利，我不得不说，TD Cowen 将其对该股票的目标价从每股 22 美元上调至 26 美元，并维持买入评级。

Bailey: Yeah, staying bullish, and you look at the street, 13 analysts, 10 of them are buys. So, is it a sell-the-news event, priced to perfection?

Bailey: 是的，市场情绪依然看涨，你看分析师们，13 位中有 10 位给出买入评级。那么，这是否是一个“利好出尽”的事件，或者说股价已经“完美定价”了呢？

Bloomberg: We'll see. It's a really good point. So, let's see what one of the company's **C-suite** (C-suite: 指公司最高管理层，如CEO、CFO等) members has to say. Harmit Singh is with us, **Chief Financial and Growth Officer** (Chief Financial and Growth Officer: 负责公司财务管理和增长战略的高级管理人员) at Levi Strauss. He joins us from our San Francisco bureau. Harmit, it's so good to have you here with us. How are you and how is the consumer doing?

Bloomberg: 我们拭目以待。这是一个非常好的观点。那么，我们来听听公司一位**高管**（C-suite: 指公司最高管理层，如CEO、CFO等）的看法。李维斯（Levi Strauss）的**首席财务兼增长官**（Chief Financial and Growth Officer: 负责公司财务管理和增长战略的高级管理人员）Harmit Singh 正在我们这里。他从我们旧金山办事处连线。Harmit，很高兴您能和我们在一起。您好吗？消费者情况如何？

### 消费者韧性与产品细分

Harmit Singh: Well, thanks for having me, Carolyn and Bailey. It's great to be here again. We had a really strong quarter, four consecutive quarters of high single-digit growth and record **gross margins** (Gross Margins: 销售收入减去销售成本后的利润率，衡量公司盈利能力), as well as the fact that we were able to raise our full-year guidance and gross margin and **EPS** (Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，衡量公司盈利能力的指标) expectations. Overall, as a company, we're a stronger and higher-performing company, defined by accelerated growth, expanding margins, and higher return on invested capital. To your question about the consumer, the consumer is largely being resilient. Our products are really well segmented. We have **Blue Tab** (Levi's 高端产品线: 李维斯的高端产品线，通常代表更优质的材料和设计), which is our premium, high-pinnacle product, and that's doing well. We've introduced that in the US, and so far, so good. We have a **Red Tab** (Levi's 主流产品线: 李维斯的主流产品线，面向更广泛的消费者群体) product that is basically marketed to consumers who earn between $100,000 and over. Based on our results, that's really done well. And then we have a **Signature** (Levi's 经济型产品线: 李维斯的经济型产品线，通常通过零售商如沃尔玛销售，面向中低收入消费者) product sold through Walmart that again had a banner quarter, and that's for lower-income consumers. So, consumer strength is really strong; that's why we were able to raise the full-year guidance, and our product pipeline has never been stronger. Now, if you go outside the US, our international business was up in the high single digits. Asia had a strong quarter with strong consumer demand. Europe had a decent quarter with consumers in a better place, and so is Latin America.

Harmit Singh: 好的，谢谢卡罗琳和贝利邀请我。很高兴再次来到这里。我们度过了一个非常强劲的季度，连续四个季度实现了高个位数增长和创纪录的**毛利率**（Gross Margins: 销售收入减去销售成本后的利润率，衡量公司盈利能力）。此外，我们还上调了全年业绩指引以及毛利率和**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share，衡量公司盈利能力的指标）预期。总的来说，作为一家公司，我们变得更强大、业绩更好，这体现在加速增长、利润率扩大和更高的投资资本回报率。至于您关于消费者的问题，消费者总体上表现出韧性。我们的产品细分做得非常好。我们有**Blue Tab**（Levi's 高端产品线: 李维斯的高端产品线，通常代表更优质的材料和设计），这是我们的高端旗舰产品，表现良好。我们已在美国推出，目前为止进展顺利。我们有一款**Red Tab**（Levi's 主流产品线: 李维斯的主流产品线，面向更广泛的消费者群体）产品，主要面向年收入 10 万美元及以上的消费者。根据我们的业绩，这款产品表现非常出色。然后，我们还有通过沃尔玛销售的**Signature**（Levi's 经济型产品线: 李维斯的经济型产品线，通常通过零售商如沃尔玛销售，面向中低收入消费者）产品，该产品再次实现了创纪录的季度表现，面向的是低收入消费者。因此，消费者实力非常强劲，这也是我们能够上调全年业绩指引的原因，而且我们的产品线从未如此强大。现在，如果看看美国以外的市场，我们的国际业务实现了高个位数增长。亚洲市场表现强劲，消费者需求旺盛。欧洲市场表现良好，消费者状况有所改善，拉丁美洲也是如此。

### 关税影响与供应链多元化

Bloomberg: Well, I'm just going to lay it out for you. I think I bought my first pair of Levi's in a long time just a couple of months ago, and my daughter, who's 22, much younger than me, has been buying Levi's for a while. So, Bailey, I mean, they're back. I go into the store downtown in the village, and it's packed.

Bloomberg: 好的，我就直说了。我觉得我很久以来第一次买李维斯牛仔裤就是几个月前，而我 22 岁的女儿，比我年轻得多，已经买李维斯好一阵子了。所以，贝利，我的意思是，它们又回来了。我走进市中心村里的店，店里挤满了人。

Bailey: Well, you've got a partnership with Beyoncé. All the marketing you're spending is targeting both young and older generations. But Harmit, I want to ask about tariffs. So, Levi expects tariffs from China to be about 30%, but increased expectations to 20% from the rest of the world. Where are you sourcing your denim materials? Are you more exposed to that doubling in terms of getting materials from Vietnam instead of China?

Bailey: 你们与碧昂丝合作。你们在营销上投入了大量资金，旨在吸引年轻和年长两代人。但 Harmit，我想问一下关税问题。李维斯预计来自中国的关税约为 30%，但将来自世界其他地区的预期提高到 20%。你们的牛仔布材料是从哪里采购的？你们是否更多地受到这种关税翻倍的影响，比如从越南而不是中国采购材料？

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So, overall, we're taking a holistic approach as we are able to offset the tariff impact. As you think about this year, we raised guidance in the top line, the bottom line, and gross margin, so we've been able to withstand that. To your specific question, Bailey, we import about 1% into the US from China, and a little over a percent from India. Vietnam is in the mid to high single digits. So, most of our imports are from Southeast Asian countries, think Bangladesh, think Pakistan, and the rest of Asia. The way we think about our supply chain, it's fairly well diversified. We import from about 20 countries into the US. 60% of our business is outside the US. And so, we're well positioned to mitigate and offset tariffs. And the way we're thinking about the holistic approach, given that volume is driving a big piece of our revenue momentum and we have tenured vendor relationships, we're working with our vendors. We're looking at different cost efficiencies across our organization, as well as being very thoughtful about pricing.

Harmit Singh: 是的。所以，总的来说，我们正在采取一种全面的方法来抵消关税影响。考虑到今年，我们上调了营收、利润和毛利率的指引，因此我们能够承受住这种影响。针对您具体的问题，贝利，我们从中国进口到美国的商品约占 1%，从印度进口的略高于 1%。越南的比例在中高个位数。因此，我们的大部分进口来自东南亚国家，比如孟加拉国、巴基斯坦以及亚洲其他地区。我们对供应链的看法是，它相当多元化。我们从大约 20 个国家进口商品到美国。我们 60% 的业务在美国以外。因此，我们有能力减轻和抵消关税。考虑到销量是我们营收增长势头的重要驱动力，并且我们拥有长期的供应商关系，我们正在与供应商合作，在整个组织内寻求不同的成本效率，同时也在定价方面非常谨慎。

Bloomberg: So, let me just ask you though, you mentioned you raised your full-year outlook. You did warn that tariffs are starting to bite profitability, though gross margins improved. So, these are good things, but again, tariffs are starting to bite. Harmit, can you tell us what that means? What is the "bite" of tariffs, how much, any color around that?

Bloomberg: 那么，我只想问您，您提到上调了全年展望。但您确实警告说，关税开始侵蚀盈利能力，尽管毛利率有所改善。所以，这些都是好消息，但关税又开始产生影响了。Harmit，您能告诉我们这意味着什么吗？关税的“侵蚀”具体指什么，影响有多大，能提供一些细节吗？

Harmit Singh: Sure. So, overall, we were able to raise top-line and bottom-line guidance despite absorbing tariffs, and so we are able to mitigate it. To the question about tariffs, tariffs were introduced on Liberation Day. We normally buy our products six months in advance, and so we are working through our efforts, and we've got different levers to position it. So, you take Quarter 3, the quarter we just reported, gross margins are record. So, we're able to offset tariffs because we have other things working for us, as we grow our women's business, our **direct-to-consumer** (DTC: 品牌直接向消费者销售产品或服务，不经过第三方零售商) business, and international business, all of which are accretive to gross margins and allow us to mitigate and offset some of the tariff exposure. For Quarter 4, we did guide gross margins to be slightly down versus a year ago, and had it not been for tariffs, we would have grown gross margins. But overall, as we think about the year, we'll report another year of record gross margins, so we're working on levers for 2026. The good news is we'll end the year stronger, and we believe we're well positioned to have another strong year in 2026.

Harmit Singh: 当然。所以，总的来说，尽管吸收了关税影响，我们仍能上调营收和利润指引，因此我们有能力缓解这种影响。关于关税的问题，关税是在解放日引入的。我们通常提前六个月采购产品，因此我们正在努力应对，并有不同的杠杆来调整定位。就第三季度而言，也就是我们刚刚公布的季度，毛利率创下了纪录。所以我们能够抵消关税，因为我们有其他因素在起作用，例如我们的女装业务、**直销业务**（Direct-to-Consumer, DTC: 品牌直接向消费者销售产品或服务，不经过第三方零售商）和国际业务都在增长，所有这些都对毛利率有增益作用，并使我们能够减轻和抵消部分关税风险。对于第四季度，我们确实预计毛利率将比一年前略有下降，如果不是关税，我们的毛利率本会增长。但总的来说，考虑到全年情况，我们将再次报告一个创纪录毛利率的年份，所以我们正在为 2026 年寻找新的杠杆。好消息是，我们将在更强的势头下结束本年度，并且我们相信我们已做好充分准备，在 2026 年再创佳绩。

### 定价策略与产品创新

Bloomberg: And Carol, we've talked with our good friend Peter Atwater for quite some time about a **K-shaped recovery** (K型复苏: 经济复苏模式，指不同群体或行业经济表现差异巨大，一部分快速增长，另一部分则停滞或衰退), where people who are well-off thrive, while those in the bottom quintile struggle. When you look at your goods and your ability to raise prices due to the impact of tariffs, which products are you able to more easily raise prices on without seeing consumers push away? And how are you thinking about that strategy as it relates to, say, the jeans that you sell through Walmart, where you don't have that gross margin going direct to consumer, and you likely have a consumer who's broadly speaking feeling a pinch of inflation, at least when we look at the data?

Bloomberg: 还有卡罗琳，我们和老朋友彼得·阿特沃特（Peter Atwater）谈论**K 型复苏**（K-shaped recovery: 经济复苏模式，指不同群体或行业经济表现差异巨大，一部分快速增长，另一部分则停滞或衰退）已经有一段时间了，在这种复苏中，富裕人群表现良好，而处于最低五分之一收入群体的人则举步维艰。当您审视您的商品以及在关税影响下提高价格的能力时，哪些产品您能更容易地提价，而不会导致消费者流失？您如何考虑这种策略，特别是对于那些通过沃尔玛销售的牛仔裤，在那里您没有**直销业务**（DTC: Direct-to-Consumer，品牌直接向消费者销售产品或服务，不经过第三方零售商）带来的高毛利率，而且至少从数据来看，那里的消费者普遍感受到通货膨胀的压力？

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And so, the first thing, Bailey, to your question is that our products are well segmented depending on the income profile of different consumers. I talked about Blue Tab, Red Tab, and Signature. Signature is what's sold to lower-income consumers. We've been very thoughtful about pricing. We're leading with product innovation rather than price. And so, we're doing what we can to maintain a price point. It was evident in Quarter 3. Signature, for example, I think is up in the low double digits for the year. As we think about our other products, the good news for us is our product pipeline has never been stronger. We're leading with loose and baggy styles while at the same time selling a lot of slim and skinny. Both for him and her. We've got wonderful waist-up products like trucker jackets, linen shirts, etc. And so, as a company, we're making this pivot to be more of a **denim lifestyle retailer** (Denim Lifestyle Retailer: 不仅销售牛仔服装，还提供与牛仔文化相关的全方位生活方式产品和体验的零售商) going forward. Our past was all about denim; our future is going to be about denim lifestyle.

Harmit Singh: 是的。贝利，首先回答您的问题，我们的产品根据不同消费者的收入情况进行了很好的细分。我提到了 Blue Tab、Red Tab 和 Signature。Signature 产品是面向低收入消费者的。我们在定价方面非常谨慎。我们以产品创新而非价格作为主导。因此，我们正在尽力维持一个价格点。这在第三季度表现得很明显。例如，Signature 系列本年度的增长我认为达到了两位数低端。当我们考虑其他产品时，对我们来说的好消息是，我们的产品线从未如此强大。我们以宽松和阔腿款式为主导，同时也在销售大量修身和紧身款式，男女皆有。我们还有很棒的上身产品，比如牛仔夹克、亚麻衬衫等等。因此，作为一家公司，我们正在进行这种转型，未来将更多地成为一个**牛仔生活方式零售商**（Denim Lifestyle Retailer: 不仅销售牛仔服装，还提供与牛仔文化相关的全方位生活方式产品和体验的零售商）。我们的过去是关于牛仔布的，而我们的未来将是关于牛仔生活方式的。

### 长期目标与市场领导地位

Bloomberg: I just want to know, do you really have a pair of baggy barrel jeans? I can't get my head around them. I'm trying, I'm trying, but I haven't done it. Harmit, what I do want to ask you too is, you guys have had a mission or a goal to get to $10 billion in sales by 2027. I think you may have adjusted a little bit. I also think a 15% **EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes: 息税前利润，衡量公司经营业绩的指标) margin. Could you reach 15% in the next few years even if sales have not hit that $10 billion? Talk to us a little bit about that mission.

Bloomberg: 我只是想知道，你真的有一条宽松的桶形牛仔裤吗？我还是不太能接受那种款式。我正在尝试，我正在尝试，但我还没穿过。Harmit，我还想问您，你们曾有一个目标，即到 2027 年实现 100 亿美元的销售额。我想你们可能已经做了一些调整。我也认为 15% 的**息税前利润率**（EBIT: Earnings Before Interest and Taxes，衡量公司经营业绩的指标）。即使销售额没有达到 100 亿美元，你们能在未来几年内达到 15% 吗？请您谈谈这个目标。

Harmit Singh: Yeah. No, we gave out the expectation of $10 billion and 15% on our investor day in the middle of June 2022. Since then, there's been a lot of change and a lot of uncertainty. As a company, we've navigated our way through uncertainty. We haven't given our new date on the $10 billion and the 15%. What we are thinking is we'll probably do that sometime next year. But to your question, the company that we are building and the company that has the foundation, given where we are ending this year: in 2025, we'll end at about 6% organic growth. Last year it was 3%; the year before that it was flat. If you think in EBIT margins, this year we'll end about mid-11s. Last year it was in the mid-10s; the previous year it was about 9%. So, we've seen steady progress, and our view is we'll probably get to the 15% faster than we get to the $10 billion. But really, we are a company that is steadily delivering mid-single-digit growth in a category that probably grows a little south of that. So, our view is that we are market leaders now in the US, number one in men's, number one in women's, and really resonating with the youth. And so, the question is, if we are able to stay at and implement our strategies, our view is we can continue to be market leaders and probably pick up a little bit of share, especially because the denim category is accelerating. We've seen the acceleration in the US. We've seen the acceleration outside, and that's largely driven by the world becoming more casual.

Harmit Singh: 是的。我们在 2022 年 6 月中旬的投资者日上公布了 100 亿美元销售额和 15% 利润率的预期。自那以后，发生了许多变化，也充满了不确定性。作为一家公司，我们已经成功地应对了这些不确定性。我们尚未公布实现 100 亿美元和 15% 利润率的新日期。我们正在考虑可能在明年某个时候公布。但回到您的问题，考虑到我们今年的收尾情况，我们正在建设的公司和已打下基础的公司：2025 年，我们将实现约 6% 的有机增长。去年是 3%；前年是持平。如果从息税前利润率来看，今年我们将达到 11% 左右的中段水平。去年是 10% 左右的中段水平；前年约为 9%。因此，我们看到了稳步的进展，我们的观点是，我们可能会比达到 100 亿美元销售额更快地实现 15% 的利润率。但实际上，我们是一家在牛仔品类中稳步实现中个位数增长的公司，而这个品类本身的增长速度可能略低于此。因此，我们的观点是，我们现在是美国市场的领导者，在男装和女装领域都排名第一，并且深受年轻人的喜爱。所以问题是，如果我们能够坚持并执行我们的战略，我们的观点是，我们可以继续保持市场领导地位，并可能获得一些市场份额，特别是因为牛仔品类正在加速发展。我们已经看到了美国市场和海外市场的加速增长，这主要得益于全球变得越来越休闲化。

### 中国市场与产品趋势

Bloomberg: Yeah, I have more jeans in my wardrobe than I've ever had since high school. It's really kind of wild. Anyway, Bailey, I know you've got another question.

Bloomberg: 是的，我衣柜里的牛仔裤比我高中以来任何时候都多。这真的很疯狂。无论如何，贝利，我知道您还有其他问题。

Bailey: Well, I was just going to ask in terms of geographic expansion, when you think about China, what's going on with China? And also, what products do Chinese consumers want? Is it high-end goods, or is it more of a bargain purchase?

Bailey: 好的，我只是想问一下地理扩张方面的问题，当您考虑中国市场时，中国现在情况如何？另外，中国消费者想要什么样的产品？是高端产品还是更倾向于购买特价商品？

Harmit Singh: Yeah. So, China for us is still underpenetrated. China represents about 2% or 3% of our business. Our business in China has been slow and soft. The Chinese consumer right now is going through a bit of a macro uncertain climate. But the good news for us is they love the brand. Our brand equity scores are really solid. We think China can be a business that grows double-digit over the long term. But to your specific question, the Chinese consumer is fairly discerning about the brands he or she gravitates to. There is a high-end consumer as well as a mid-market consumer, what we call the core product. So, if you think about our Asia strategy, our products are relevant for the mid-market consumer, while we also offer products for the higher premium end consumer. 30% of the Asian denim category is premium, and for example, our highest pinnacle product largely features Japanese fabric, Japanese denim, and is inspired by **selvage** (Selvage Denim: 一种传统织法制作的牛仔布，边缘有独特的织边，通常被认为是高品质牛仔布的标志). So, that's what we are selling, and I think over time we'll be able to start growing our China business back into the low double-digit range.

Harmit Singh: 是的。对我们来说，中国市场仍然渗透不足。中国业务约占我们总业务的 2% 或 3%。我们在中国的业务一直缓慢而疲软。目前，中国消费者正经历一个宏观不确定的时期。但对我们来说好消息是他们喜爱这个品牌。我们的品牌资产得分非常稳固。我们认为中国可以成为一个长期实现两位数增长的市场。但针对您具体的问题，中国消费者对他们倾向的品牌相当有辨识度。既有高端消费者，也有中端市场的消费者，我们称之为核心产品。所以，如果您考虑我们的亚洲战略，我们的产品既适用于中端市场消费者，也为高端消费者提供产品。亚洲牛仔品类中 30% 是高端产品，例如，我们最顶级的旗舰产品主要采用日本面料、日本牛仔布，并受到**赤耳牛仔布**（Selvage Denim: 一种传统织法制作的牛仔布，边缘有独特的织边，通常被认为是高品质牛仔布的标志）的启发。所以，这就是我们正在销售的产品，我认为随着时间的推移，我们将能够使我们的中国业务恢复到两位数低端的增长范围。

Bailey: Yeah, interesting. I will say, Carol, I know you mentioned you have more jeans than ever. I have been buying the sherpa jackets, the denim jackets like crazy. I don't know why I have three of them in different colors.

Bailey: 是的，很有趣。卡罗琳，我想说，我知道您提到您拥有的牛仔裤比以往任何时候都多。我一直在疯狂地买羊羔绒夹克和牛仔夹克。我不知道为什么我有三件不同颜色的。

Bloomberg: I bought a bunch of denim jackets.

Bloomberg: 我也买了很多牛仔夹克。

Bailey: That's what I'm into. I don't wear jeans; I wear chinos, but I wear the denim jackets like crazy.

Bailey: 我就是这样。我不穿牛仔裤；我穿卡其裤，但我却疯狂地穿牛仔夹克。

Bloomberg: I know. I just, I don't know, I love it. I love it. Ask everybody I work with, I wear jeans every morning.

Bloomberg: 我知道。我只是，我不知道，我喜欢它。我喜欢它。问问我所有的同事，我每天早上都穿着牛仔裤。

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And Bailey and Carol, now we've got the Blue Tab. It's a fuller jacket. You can definitely wear it to the office depending on the dress environment at Bloomberg. I walked in here fairly casual. So, it's something that we are now beginning to offer which should make its way into your wardrobe at some stage.

Harmit Singh: 是的。贝利和卡罗琳，现在我们有了 Blue Tab 系列。它是一款更宽松的夹克。您绝对可以穿着它去办公室，这取决于彭博社的着装环境。我今天来这里穿得就很休闲。所以，这是我们现在开始提供的一些产品，应该会在某个阶段进入您的衣橱。

### 业务势头与未来展望

Bloomberg: Hey, one last question. Does it feel like, gosh, it's been a crazy year, and a lot of stuff is coming at everybody, investors, the world at large? Does it feel like things are starting to calm down, on a day when we've talked about what seems like progress in a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas?

Bloomberg: 嘿，最后一个问题。您觉得，天哪，今年真是疯狂的一年，各种事情都向所有人、投资者以及整个世界袭来吗？您觉得事情开始平静下来了吗？在今天我们讨论以色列和哈马斯停火似乎取得进展的时候？

Harmit Singh: Yeah, as I mentioned earlier, we have lived through uncertainty. The good news for us is the category is strong. We have real business momentum. The brand has never been stronger, and we have a product pipeline that has never been fuller, especially as we head towards the holidays. Our focus right now is making sure our product is on the floor, because what we have seen, Carol, is consumers gravitate to newness and gravitate to what's relevant. And our view is if we can offer the right product and build a brand experience, that's why we've got real focus on our **direct-to-consumer** (DTC: 品牌直接向消费者销售产品或服务，不经过第三方零售商) business while complementing growth with our **wholesale business** (批发业务: 产品通过第三方零售商或分销商进行销售的商业模式). So, this quarter, both DTC and wholesale were up. We had five consecutive quarters of high growth in the US, and it's fueled by both channels.

Harmit Singh: 是的，正如我之前提到的，我们已经经历了不确定性。对我们来说好消息是这个品类很强大。我们有真正的业务发展势头。品牌从未如此强大，我们的产品线也从未如此丰富，尤其是在我们走向假日季的时候。我们目前的重点是确保我们的产品及时上架，因为卡罗琳，我们看到消费者倾向于新颖性和相关性。我们的观点是，如果我们能提供正确的产品并建立品牌体验，这就是为什么我们非常关注我们的**直销业务**（DTC: Direct-to-Consumer，品牌直接向消费者销售产品或服务，不经过第三方零售商），同时通过**批发业务**（Wholesale Business: 产品通过第三方零售商或分销商进行销售的商业模式）来补充增长。所以，本季度，DTC 和批发业务都实现了增长。我们在美国连续五个季度实现了高增长，这得益于这两个渠道。

Bloomberg: All right. Well, Harmit, when you talk with your design team, I like high-waist buttons, kind of slim through the legs, and then a little flare. I'm just going to put it out there. A little stretch in there too is kind of my favorite. My favorite, my favorite.

Bloomberg: 好的。Harmit，当您和您的设计团队交流时，我喜欢高腰纽扣款，腿部修身，然后有一点微喇。我就直说了。带点弹力也是我的最爱。我的最爱，我的最爱。

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And I'll take that feedback, Carolyn. You know, I sincerely believe feedback is a gift, and getting feedback from consumers like yourself is something that I'll take upon myself to relay to our designers.

Harmit Singh: 是的。我会采纳这个反馈的，卡罗琳。你知道，我真诚地相信反馈是一种礼物，收到像您这样的消费者的反馈，我会亲自转达给我们的设计师。

Bloomberg: All right, I'm going to hold you to it. All right, good stuff. Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer over at Levi Strauss, joining us from our bureau in San Francisco.

Bloomberg: 好的，我记住了。好的，很棒。Harmit Singh，李维斯（Levi Strauss）的首席财务兼增长官，从我们旧金山办事处连线。
