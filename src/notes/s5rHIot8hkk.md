### 迪士尼的魔力与百年传承

**Nicola Tangan:** 大家好，我是**挪威银行投资管理公司**（Norges Bank Investment Management: 挪威主权财富基金的管理机构）的首席执行官尼古拉·坦根。今天，我们将深入探讨迪士尼这个神奇的世界，我们很荣幸能持有该公司超过1%的股份。我身边这位是鲍勃·艾格，这位富有远见的领导者将迪士尼转型为全球娱乐巨头，主导了**皮克斯**（Pixar: 著名动画工作室）、**漫威**（Marvel: 知名漫画与电影公司）和**21世纪福克斯**（21st Century Fox: 曾是美国主要媒体公司，后大部分资产被迪士尼收购）等大胆的收购。鲍勃，热烈欢迎！

<p class="english-text">hi everyone I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of Noras Bank investment management and today we're diving into the Magical World of Disney a company where we are the lucky owner or more than 1% and I'm here with Bob Iger the Visionary leader who transformed Disney into a global entertainment Powerhouse leading Bold Acquisitions like Pixar marel and 21st century FKS Bob warm welcome thank you</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 非常感谢，很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very much nice to be here</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 没有任何一家公司能在一百多年里让如此多的人爱过、哭过。那么，在您看来，是什么让迪士尼如此特别？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no I think no other company has made so many people love and cry over more than a hundred years so in your mind what is it that makes Disney so special</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我认为首先，正如您所说，我们一百多年来一直触动着人们的心弦，这意义非凡。因为当你讲述的故事能对人们产生我们故事所带来的那种影响时，它们就会变得令人难忘，成为人们生活结构的一部分。而且这些故事也经常被与他人分享，所以基本上有很多人一起享受我们的故事，我认为这也增强了我们故事讲述的影响力。此外，我们还成功地坚守了我们的核心价值观，我认为这非常重要。当你看到迪士尼的名字出现在一个产品上时，你就知道你会得到什么，我认为这对于我们能够在一个多世纪里保持相关性起到了很大的作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think first of all the fact that we've touched people's hearts for as you cited over a hundred years uh is Meaningful because when you tell stories that have the kind of effect that our stories have on people uh they become memorable they become you know part of the fabric of people's lives uh and there are also stories that are frequently shared with other people so you have a basically a number of people enjoying our stories together and that also I think compounds the impact of our storytelling uh We've also you know managed to um stick to our core values and I think that's really important you know what you're going to get when you see the name Disney on a product and I think that goes a long way to enabling us to be relevant for over a century</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 那么，经营一家可以说是人类历史一部分的公司，感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how does he feel to run a company which is kind of part of the fabric of human history</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，这无疑是我所意识到的，因为随之而来的是一份责任，不仅要维护并继续加强公司的遗产，还要以最高水平的质量提供娱乐。全球消费者对我们有着如此高的期望，你必须达到这些期望，有时甚至要努力超越它们。我认为随之而来的，我不会称之为负担，因为它是一份我们都乐于接受的责任，但我们确实非常清楚我们需要满足消费者的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well it is certainly something that I'm aware of because with it comes a responsibility not just to uh maintain and to continue to strengthen the legacy of the company but also to entertain at the highest level of quality there's such an expectation from our consumers around the world that you have to live up to and at times even work to exceed expectations and I think with that again comes I wouldn't call it a burden because it's it's a responsibility that we all eagerly accept but we're certainly well aware of our uh need to serve consumers expectations</p>
</details>

### 想象世界的持久魅力

**Nicola Tangan:** 您认为我们为什么仍然如此被这些想象世界所吸引？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why do you think we're still so drawn to these imaginary worlds</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，正如**华特·迪士尼**（Walt Disney: 迪士尼公司的创始人）常说的，人们常常喜欢体验事物或听故事，这能让他们本质上与日常生活和日常责任保持距离。这有一种逃避现实的特质，但我认为在许多其他方面，迪士尼的故事中也有一些共通之处，比如**共鸣性**（relatability），以及我们故事讲述中反映的共同经历。还有幻想的概念，点燃人们的想象力，创造魔力。我认为迪士尼还有一个非常独特的特点，那就是我们创造的东西可以被多代人同时享受。如果你去我们的主题公园，你会一次又一次地看到祖父母、父母和他们的孩子一起游玩。我认为这在人们与我们产品互动的方式上是非常独特的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well as Walt Disney used to say you know people often uh like to uh e either experience things or or or or hear stories told that enables them to essentially distance themselves from kind of their daily lives and their daily responsibilities there's a there's an Escapist quality but I think in many other respects with Disney stories you know there are there are things like uh relatability uh common experiences that are reflected in our storytelling uh there's the whole notion of fantasy and igniting people's imagination and creating magic um there's also I think something that's very very unique to Disney and that is that we make things that can be uh enjoyed by multiple Generations all at once if you go to our theme parks you see that grandparents and parents and and their children for instance uh time and time again and I think that is very very unique in terms of the uh way in which people engage with the product that we create</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 这是您必须越来越多地做的事情吗？为了吸引几代人而融入更多吸引人的元素？当我观看像《**海底总动员**》（Finding Nemo: 皮克斯动画电影）这样的作品时，我发现您融入了如此多的复杂层次，吸引了各种不同类型的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is that something you have to do more and more to build in appealing things for several Generations It just strikes me when I watch you know things like Finding Nemo you have built in so many uh so many layers of complexity that appeals to so many different type of people</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我们努力本质上讲述尽可能**易于理解**（accessible）的故事，并最好地反映我们所讲述故事的世界。我认为这非常关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know we we try to essentially uh tell stories that are as accessible as possible and that best reflect the world that uh we are telling stories to I think that's that's really quite critical</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 那么，您认为这里的共同点是什么？比如，一个想成为英雄的**弱者**（underdog）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and why do you think so a common denominator here is like you know the underdog who wants to become a hero</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 是的，我认为我们故事讲述的许多方面都能引起共鸣。其中之一就是我所说的**多代人体验**（multigenerational experience）。另一个事实是，我们努力讲述那些尊重长辈的故事，例如，你在**皮克斯**（Pixar）的电影《**飞屋环游记**》（Up）或《**寻梦环游记**》（Coco）中肯定看到了这一点。我们喜欢英雄之旅，我们知道人们喜欢为弱者加油，也喜欢为英雄在冒险或寻求战胜邪恶时欢呼。我认为英雄之旅是非常重要的一部分。我们还喜欢在故事中融入家庭和友谊的重要性，这真的非常重要，以及一些巨大的惊喜元素。但我认为最重要的是，故事能创造一种**奇迹感**（sense of wonder），让人们微笑，感到快乐，并对他们所生活的世界感到美好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes I think that you know many aspects of our storytelling that resonates one of is what I basically multigenerational experience another is just the fact that we try to tell stories where we show respect for elders as a for instance you certainly saw that in like a movie like up by Pixar or coco which was also a Pixar movie we like Heroes Journeys we know that people love to both root for the underdog but also cheer on the hero as the hero is you know basically going on some Adventure or seeking to conquer evil you name it I think the hero's journey is a very very important part of it we also like to infuse in our stories the importance not just a family but a friendship really important uh and also elements of of great surprise but I think more than anything else stories that create a sense of wonder that make people people uh smile feel happy uh and feel good about the world that they live in</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您觉得公司有责任推广积极的价值观吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you feel that you have a responsibility to promote positive values as a firm</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 非常有责任，是的。我认为，我并不认为这是一种负担，但我确实认为这对于维护迪士尼的实力和遗产至关重要。这基本上意味着我们要对如何讲述故事、如何描绘情境或角色，或者仅仅是一般情况，都非常负责任。这非常非常重要。是的，将迪士尼的名字放在我们创造的任何东西上，都伴随着巨大的责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very much so yes I think and I I don't view it as a burden but I do view it as critical in terms of you know maintaining the strength and the legacy of of Disney um and and that is basically to be really responsible in how we tell stories how we you know depict situations or characters uh or or just general circumstances very very important yes there's a lot of responsibility that comes with just putting the Disney name on something that we've created</p>
</details>

### 文化符号的所有权与迪士尼文化

**Nicola Tangan:** 那么，您创造了这些令人难以置信的角色，它们对我们的文化如此重要。在某种程度上，这有点像音乐史，有些人控制着**音乐版权目录**（back cataloges）。您认为一家公司拥有这些权利是正确的，还是它们应该属于全人类？或者您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so um you created these incredible um characters which are so important for for our culture and in a way it's a bit like you know the music history where some people control you know the back cataloges is it do you think it's right that one company should own it or should it belong to humankind or just what do you think</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，这是一个有趣的问题。显然，我们必须服务于我们的客户和股东。当我们让股东拥有所有权时，这是至关重要的，因为这使我们能够显然地将伟大的创造力**货币化**（monetize）或在财务上**资本化**（capitalize）。顺便说一句，我不认为我们对此拥有垄断权。在今天的世界，多亏了科技，几乎每个人都是创造者，但被创造的东西也更多了，所以竞争比以往任何时候都激烈。因此，我并不觉得我们以任何方式垄断了市场。我认为我们在世界故事讲述方面是领导者，但我认为我们并没有垄断市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well that's an interesting question well obviously we have to serve both our customers and our shareholders uh and when we put our shareholders add-on owning is critical because that gives us the ability to obviously um monetize or or capitalize financially on great creativity um I don't think we have a monopoly on it by the way there are many in particularly in today's world thanks to technology um almost everyone's a Creator but there's more that is being created so there's more competition than ever before so I don't feel feel that we in any way you know have cornered the market on this I think we are leader in terms of Storytelling in the world but I don't think we've cornered the market</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 如果我们谈论迪士尼的文化，华特·迪士尼的痕迹还剩下多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if we um touch on the culture at Disney how much is left of uh Walt in the Disney Company</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，这是一个非常非常好的问题。顺便说一句，他的办公室仍然存在。您从未见过他，对吗？他是在60年代中期，1966年去世的。我是在1974年加入公司的，当时是**ABC**（American Broadcasting Company: 美国广播公司），后来在90年代被迪士尼收购，成为了迪士尼的一部分。我从未见过华特。顺便说一句，我偶尔会遇到见过他的人。就在上周，我在**迪士尼乐园**（Disneyland）遇到了一位在公司工作了62年的员工。哇！当我问他职业生涯的亮点是什么时，他说和华特·迪士尼共进午餐。当然，我当时就坐下来，想知道所有细节，因为我总是对华特非常好奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well that's a very very good question uh by the way his office still exists you never met him right he died in the no he died in in the mid-60s in 1966 I joined uh the company in well was ABC then 1974 uh became Disney we were acquired by by Disney in the 90s now I never met Walt uh by the way I meet people occasionally that did uh just by the way last week I was at Disneyland and I met an employee that had been with a company for 62 years wow and when I asked him what the highlight of his career was he said having lunch with Walt Disney of course then I sat down with him and wanted to know all about it because I'm always very curious about Walt</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我认为华特显然负责创造了迪士尼的过去，并在许多方面也塑造了迪士尼的现在，那就是对故事讲述的热爱，以及了解故事讲述在世界上是多么有价值和重要。我认为他意识到了，我也意识到了，世界需要伟大的故事讲述。可以说，也许今天这种需求比以往任何时候都更大。以最高水平娱乐世界的需求，以及以最高水平聆听和体验故事的需求，我认为这是一项有价值的事业。我们仍然坚持这一原则，即在我们的故事讲述中融入高价值，并认识到我们的唯一目的，我们的主要目的，是讲述能触动人心并激励全球人民的伟大故事。因此，在许多方面，华特的遗产仍然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Walt you know obviously is responsible for creating you know what Disney was and in many respects what Disney is which is this fondness for storytelling telling and the knowledge of how valuable and how important it can be in the world I think he was aware as I am aware that uh the world needs great storytelling it could argue that maybe today that need is greater than ever before and serving a World's need to be entertained at the highest level and to be to hear and experience stories at the highest level I think is a is a worthy cause and we still adhere to that principle of high value infused in our storytelling of the knowledge that you know we our sole purpose really our main purpose is to tell great stories that touch people's hearts and Inspire them uh all over the world um so in many respects it hasn't Walt's Legacy still exists</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 另一个仍然存在的特点是，华特热爱使用技术。我知道你想谈论这与技术的关系，但华特热爱使用技术来帮助他讲述更好的故事，并乐于接受技术来做到这一点，以服务于故事讲述者的目的。这种精神在公司中仍然非常强烈。他也是一个伟大的冒险家。在今天的世界，也许在华特所处的时代也是如此，冒险是商业的关键部分，尤其是在一个变化如此之快、颠覆如此之多的世界里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the other thing that still exists is Walt was I know you want to talk about this as it relates to technology but Walt loved the use of Technology uh in in terms of enabling him to tell better stories and embrace technology um readily to do that and that to serve the purpose of the Storyteller that Spirit still very much exists at the company as well he also was a great risk taker and uh the in in today's world but maybe you could argue in in Walt's world too you know taking risks becomes a critical part of of of a business particularly in a world that's changing so fast and being so disrupted</p>
</details>

### 技术、创意与长寿之道

**Nicola Tangan:** 您认为他会对今天的技术作何感想？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think he would have made of today's technology</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 据那些认识他的人告诉我，以及我所读到的一切——我几乎读遍了所有关于华特和迪士尼公司的历史书籍——他就是热爱技术。首先，他拥有一颗奇妙的好奇心，这也非常关键。我认为有了这种好奇心，他渴望学习、实验、实践、发现，特别是技术最终如何能让他讲述更好的故事。这让他非常兴奋。我总是鼓励人们走类似的道路。所以我认为他会对今天的技术感到非常振奋，而不是被它吓倒。我认为他是一个当他看到或听到技术时，会立即看到机会而不是威胁的人。他将技术视为资产，而非负债。我一直努力让这种拥抱技术、尝试和实验技术在所有业务中应用的能力成为迪士尼文化的一个要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as as far as I have been told by people who knew him and from everything that I have read and I've certainly read just about every history book on Walton on the Disney Company he just loved technology it he was he had a first of all he had a a wonderfully curious mind which is also very critical by the way and I think with that he wanted to learn experiment practice discover particularly how technology ultimately can enable him to tell better stories uh it just excited him greatly and I always exhort people to basically follow the similar path so I think he would be really I think motivated in many respects by technology today and not daunted by it I think he was one who believed when he saw or heard about technology he immediately saw opportunity instead of threat and um he view technology as an asset not a liability and I've tried really hard for that to be an element of the Disney culture the Embrace of Technology uh and the ability to try and experiment with the application of technology in all of our businesses</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您说过“梦想远大，一切皆有可能”。这些在某种程度上是相当**美国化**（American）的价值观。您认为这家公司有可能在欧洲创立吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you say things like dream big anything can happen now uh these are uh in a way uh quite American values do you think the company could ever have been founded in Europe</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 华特的一些最早、最伟大的故事灵感来源于欧洲伟大的故事讲述者，比如**格林兄弟**（Brothers Grimm）和**汉斯·克里斯蒂安·安徒生**（H. Christian Anderson）。所以我认为他对此抱有敬意。他也喜欢旅行，他周游欧洲，在许多方面，他在迪士尼乐园建造的一些东西就来源于他的灵感，他通过旅行、了解文化和地方而获得的灵感，他希望世界感觉像一个整体，而不是一个完全分裂的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what was inspired is some of his earliest greatest stories were inspired by the great European storytellers of the brothers grim and H Christian Anderson for instance so I I think he had a respect he he also he liked to travel and he traveled around Europe and in many respects some things that he built at Disneyland came from his inspiration the inspiration that he got through traveling um and learning about cultures and learning about places and and wanting the world to feel like a one world instead of a basically a a world that was you know completely completely broken up</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 管理创意天才的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the key to managing creative genuses</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** **同理心**（empathy）是最大的关键。你必须明白，当一个创作者向你讲述了一个精彩的故事，而你给了他们讲述这个故事的能力，你给了他们资源、金钱、工具和场所去讲述这个故事时，这个故事往往是源于他们内心深处的。那是他们的热情所在，是他们自己的思想和心灵的创造。然后你必须明白，管理一个本质上从内心深处创造出属于他们自己的东西的人，是多么微妙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">empathy is the biggest key um you have to understand that uh when a Creator um has has pitched you a great story and and you've given them the ability to go out and tell that story you've given them the resources the the the money the tools the place to tell that story um that story is often coming from within them it's a passion of theirs it is the invention of their own mind and their own heart and you have to understand then just how delicate it is to to manage someone who is essentially um creating something that comes from within them that is inherently</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 虽然我们代表公司有责任确保他们正确地讲述故事，并尽可能地追求故事讲述的完美，有时这需要我们更多地依赖他们才能获得我们想要的结果，但你必须始终站在他们的角度来做。这是最关键的。然后还要明白，创造力不是可以简化为数学或科学的东西，它极其不可预测。所有的创造力都伴随着固有的风险，因此你不仅要知道如何欣赏伟大创造力所带来的成功，还要知道如何处理失败，而不是指责，而不是事后诸葛亮，而不是在创意失败时过于苛刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">theirs uh and while we have a responsibility on behalf of the company to make sure that they're telling their stories right and and and and they're pursuing the extent possible perfection in terms of Storytelling and that sometimes requires us to lean on them more in order to get the results that we want you have to always do so by putting yourself in their shoes that's the most critical and then also understanding that creativity is not something that's reduced to math or science it's extremely unpredictable there's an inherent risk involved in all creativity and therefore you have to know not just how to un under not just how to appreciate success that great creativity can generate but also to process basically the failures and not point fingers and not second yes um and not be ultra critical when a creative idea fails</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 那么，创意人员会经历这些创意爆发期，对吧？它们可以持续一段时间，然后你会经历一个较慢的时期。当人们经历没有创造力产出的时期时，您会怎么做？您会给他们多长时间，然后才期望看到更多产出？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um creative people go through these creative Spurs right and they can last for some time and then you go through a slower period what do you do when people kind of go through periods where there is no creativity coming out how long time do you give them before you expect to see more</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 这是一个好问题。你知道，我非常相信给予人们第二次机会，对于我称之为**诚实的错误**（honest mistakes）。而不是在出现**越轨行为**（transgression）、完全的**判断失误**（lapse of judgment）或某种形式的**诚信缺失**（breakdown of integrity）时给予第二次机会。谈到创造力，我认为每个人在作为创作者的某个时候都经历过失败，无论他们是谁。这包括伟大的作曲家、伟大的艺术家，以及你所能想到的所有伟大人物。伟大的歌手也唱过烂歌，画家也画过烂画，我可以一直说下去。但有时，就在一次大失败之后，会迎来一次巨大的成功。所以我尽量对那些创造出不尽如人意作品的人保持耐心。当然，如果这种情况持续下去，如果有人完全失去了他们的创意方向，那么显然你就不太可能再让他们代表你进行创作了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's a good that's a good question you know I'm a big believer in in in uh in in giving people second chances for what I'll call Honest mistakes and not giving people Second Chances when you know there's a transgression a complete lapse of judgment or in some form or another a breakdown of Integrity when it comes to creativity I think you you know everyone's had a failure at some point in their lives if they're a Creator I don't care who they are and um and then you know that includes you know great composers and and great artists and you name it great singers have had bad songs and Painters have had bad pictures and I could go on and on uh but sometimes that just right after a big failure comes a huge hit and I so I try to be patient with people that are creating that that deliver something that is less than we we had hoped for or expected now if it persists obviously U if if someone has essentially completely lost their creative way then obviously you you tend not to not to allow them to create again on your behalf</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您遇到过的最有创意的人是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">who's the most creative person you ever met</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 哦，我一生中非常幸运地遇到了一些非常富有创造力的人，从艺术家到动画师再到表演者。我不知道我是否能只说出一个名字，但我遇到过很多，在这方面我很幸运。包括，你知道，我可以说**保罗·麦卡特尼**（Paul McCartney: 英国著名音乐家，披头士乐队成员）就是我遇到过的最有创意的人之一。例如，**史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格**（Steven Spielberg: 美国著名电影导演）也很容易是另一个。在迪士尼工作的伟大人物，我不想点名其中任何一个，因为我有很多这样的人。但我一生中很幸运，特别是在这份工作中，不仅遇到过，而且还与我们时代的一些伟大创作者有过业务往来或接触。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh I've been really fortunate in my life to have met uh some wonderfully creative people from artist to animators to performers um I don't know if I could I don't know if I could name just one um but I've met many and I'm lucky in that regard you i' including you know I could argue you know Paul McCartney for instance is one of the most creative people I've ever met as for instance Steven Spielberg would would would easily you know be another one great people that work at Disney I don't want to single any one of those out because I have so many of them but I've been lucky in my life particularly in this job to have not only met but have actually done business with or been engaged with some of the great creators of our time</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您被广泛认为是世界上最成功的首席执行官之一，但您自己有创造力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean you're Wily considered um one of the most successful cosos but are you are you yourself creative</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我不认为自己是创造者。我认为自己是一个热爱创造力、欣赏创造力的人，在大多数情况下，我认为我能分辨好坏。我知道什么时候看到的东西是真正的好或伟大的，也知道什么时候看到的东西不是。我认为我更像一个**编辑**（editor），而不是创造者。我能以一种希望是客观的眼光看待一些创意作品，并提供意见，更多地是作为编辑而不是其他，帮助创作者提高他们作品的质量。但我不是创造者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh I don't consider myself a Creator I consider myself someone that uh loves creativity that appreciates it that for the most part I think I I know good from bad I know when I see something and it's really good or great and I know when I see something that isn't I think I put myself more in an editor's category than in a Creator category where I can uh you know lend a an eye uh hopefully an objective eye to some piece of creativity and and give input um as more an editor than anything else uh to the Creator to help them um improve the quality of their creation but I'm not a Creator</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 现在，大量资金投入到新制作中，它们非常昂贵，对吧？它们复杂，期望很高，等等。有大型委员会。这些流程和项目是否像以前一样产生同样的兴奋和创造力？整个事情是否变得更加**委员会化**（committee-based）、可预测和**平庸**（dollar）？您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now um there is a lot of money going into new production they're very expensive right they are complex uh big expectations and so on uh big committees uh these um processes and projects are they producing the same type of excitement and creativity as before is the whole thing just becoming more committee based predictable dollar what do you think</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我肯定会反对这种说法。首先，我们尽量不以委员会的方式处理创造力。通常会有不同的声音参与其中，但最终，通常是一个创作者的声音必须主导。我认为你根本不可能通过委员会来创造，也不可能通过**核对清单**（checking boxes）来创造，也就是说，某个人的创造力是否符合所有这些标准，因为那样你就会被一些可能不符合但同样好的东西所惊喜。所以我根本不喜欢委员会的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I certain would object to to that um first of all uh we try not to approach creativity on a committee basis there there are often you know different voices that that weigh in on it but in the end it's a it's typically one Creator's voice that has to basically rule the day I don't think you can create by committee at all nor can you create by checking boxes meaning for someone's creativity does it meet all these standards because then you get surprised by something or or or does it meet all this criteria you get surprised by something that may not but is equally good um so I don't like committee approach to it at all</p>

**Bob Iger:** 我认为在这个创造如此之多的世界里，虽然有人可能会争辩说这稀释了创造力的质量，但我认为也可以争辩说，今天的技术，主要是生产和分发创造力的技术，比昨天强大得多，它正在促成更多的创造力，而不是更少。也许质量被稀释了一点，因为制作的东西更多了，但我仍然不断看到精彩创造力的例子。就拿我们公司来说，《**头脑特工队2**》（Inside Out Too: 皮克斯动画电影续集）就是一个很好的例子。顺便说一句，那是九到十年前制作的电影的续集。它极富创意，商业上也取得了巨大成功。例如，我们制作的电视剧《**幕府将军**》（Shogun）也极富创意。**漫威**（Marvel）电影《**死侍与金刚狼**》（Deadpool and Wolverine）也极富创意。我可以一直说下去。

<p class="english-text">I think in this world where so much is being created uh I don't one while one could argue it kind of duded the quality of creativity um I think could also argue that today's technology mostly to produce and distribute creativity is you know so much more um uh powerful than yesterday's that it's enabling much more creativity and not less now maybe the quality is is diluted a bit because so much more is being made but I I still see examples constantly of of wonderful creativity and just you thinking about our company uh inside out too would be a great example of that and by the way that's a sequel to a movie that was made you know nine or 10 years ago um fantastically creative and very successful commercially as well a film a Shogun a TV series uh that we produced as a for instance incredibly creative uh Deadpool and Wolverine a Marvel movie extremely creative um and I could go on and on</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 所以，我并不担心一个创造力变得更乏味或更稀释的世界。这个世界上仍然有如此多的创意天才，我认为今天的世界绝没有减少创意天才的数量。我甚至会争辩说，它正在激发他们的才华，因为技术使更多的人能够比以往任何时候都进行创作，并将他们的创造力传递给其他人。

**Nicola Tangan:** 您先在**ABC**（American Broadcasting Company: 美国广播公司）工作，然后又在整个迪士尼公司工作了50年。您能预测什么是好是坏吗？您上一次真正感到惊讶是什么时候？无论是您认为会很棒但失败了，还是相反？

</details>

**Bob Iger:** 偶尔我会看到一些非常好的东西，最终却出乎意料地表现出色，因为它比我预想的更能引起共鸣。这种情况发生得比相反的情况更频繁，即我看到一些失败了，而我没想到它会失败。

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我们从事这些工作所得到的报酬之一就是保持与时俱进。我想你可以说，你年纪越大，这越难，但我努力做到。我的意思是，一个好的高管，即善于管理创造力并善于赋能创作者的高管，做了大量工作来保持对世界脉搏的把握。虽然我不认为自己是当今文化领域最伟大的专家，但我确实有许多与文化接触的**触点**（touch points），这使我能够更好地理解和欣赏它。顺便说一句，其中一些是个人原因。我有五个孙辈，最小的八岁，最大的十六岁。例如，仅仅是和他们在一起的时间，我们公司也有几代人一起工作。我73岁了，已经工作了50年。我与公司里比我年轻50岁的人打交道，他们比我更接近当今文化。

**Bob Iger:** 但我也把它作为我日常工作的一部分，真正去接触我称之为“新文化”。你知道，无论是观看短视频、用户生成内容，还是参与社交平台，努力保持相关性，或者努力真正理解当今世界什么能引起共鸣。我认为，我们的产品能引起共鸣至关重要。有时，这显然或经常需要我们真正了解消费者趋势、消费者兴趣，以及人们品味的变化和人们如何花时间娱乐的颠覆。

### 卓越领导者的特质

**Nicola Tangan:** 鲍勃，一个伟大的领导者需要具备什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bob um what makes a great leader</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我认为成为或成为一个伟大领导者需要许多因素。其中之一我刚才提到了一点，那就是平衡**传承**（Heritage）和**创新**（Innovation）的能力。我认为这很关键。它基本上是知道如何创新，即使你被遗产所包围。这真的非常重要。类似地，你必须始终一只脚踏在现在，一只脚踏在未来。你显然必须花时间管理你今天的业务，确保它达到最高的质量、效率等。但你也必须展望未来，看看未来的商业机会在哪里，或者你的业务明天可能会走向何方。如果你两只脚都踏在未来，那么你对当前业务的管理就不够。如果你两只脚都踏在现在，那么你就没有为未来准备好你的公司或你自己。所以这种平衡真的非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think there are a number of things that um you know that that go into becoming or being a great leader one I talked about a little bit and that's having the ability to ba to balance Heritage and Innovation um and and I think that's critical it's knowing basically um how to innovate uh even though you know you're you're surrounded in a way by by Legacy um that's really important um similar in nature you have to have a foot in the present and a foot in the future at all times you have to obviously spend time managing your business for today make sure that it's Peak quality uh efficiency Etc but you also have to be looking around the corner at what uh business opportunities or where your business might go tomorrow if you have two feet in the future then you're not managing your business enough in the present you have two feet in the present then you're not preparing your your company or yourself for the future so that balance is really important</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我们谈到了要有同理心。我认为我不仅对创作者，而且对许多人，都努力设身处地为他们着想，以理解他们正在经历什么。我还认为，尤其是在迪士尼，一个伟大的领导者必须对创作者和创作过程有深刻的欣赏和尊重。你知道，这很关键。我还经常谈到，你必须是一个**乐观主义者**（optimist）。人们不想追随悲观主义者。适度的**现实主义**（realism）通常很关键，可以激励人们，让他们充满活力。但始终要保持一种希望感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we talked about having empathy I think I try not just for create with creators but for many people to put myself in their shoes to understand you know what they're experiencing U I also feel certainly at Disney a great leader has to have a deep appreciation and respect for creators in the creative process you know that's critical um I also and I talk about this a lot um you have to be an optimist people don't want to follow pessimists a dose of realism is often critical uh to get people um motivated and to to energize them a bit but always by maintaining a sense of hope</p>
</details>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您提到保持乐观很重要。我听您说过，您**毫无畏惧**（absolutely no fear）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you mentioned it's important to be an optimist I've heard you say uh that you have absolutely no fear</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我想我算是幸运的，我不是一个过度焦虑的人。我不知道，我以前偶尔会开玩笑说我没有“恐惧基因”。看，任何人类内心都有一些恐惧，但我不是，恐惧根本不会引导我。我更多地被机会、被发现和实验的渴望所引导。我认为，当我描述伟大的领导者时，我认为他们是真正好奇、渴望创新、渴望发现、渴望了解未来的人，他们不只看过去或现在，而是看所有这些方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess I was kind of lucky I'm I'm not an overly anxious person and I I don't know I used to joke every once in a while say I wasn't born with a fear Gene look any human being has some element of fear within them but I'm not I'm not fear does not is doesn't guide me at all I'm I'm guided more by opportunity uh by um a desire to discover and to um and to experiment uh and I think actually when I describe great leaders I think it's having someone who's really curious who wants to innovate who wants to discover who wants to know what's around the corner and is not just looking at what the past or even the present but is kind of looking at all of those things</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 此外，一个领导者必须具备强大的专注能力，设定优先级并坚持下去，并且要果断。没有人想要一个无法及时做出决策的领导者，那会极大地破坏生产力。

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我们可以谈谈这个。我早起是有原因的，这不仅仅是我的天性，它还服务于一个重要的目的。但在我谈到这一点之前，我认为您提到了“精力”这个词。我不太常谈论它，您提出来真是太好了，因为一个伟大的领导者也必须是一个充满活力的领导者。看，我是一个人，所以如果我因为全球旅行、长时间工作等等而感到非常疲惫，我不会害怕向我的员工展示这一点，因为我认为这是一种**亲和力**（relatability）的方式。他们也会有这种感觉，这是人性，有时你会感到工作过度和疲惫。但我认为在大多数情况下，你必须在工作的每一刻，也就是每一个清醒的时刻，都投入你的精力，因为精力是激励人的。

<p class="english-text">well um we can talk about that there's a reason that I get up early not just how I'm wired but it it serves a a great purpose but you know before I get to that I think you know you mentioned the word energy I don't talk about it that much I'm it's great that you brought that up um because a great leader has to be an energetic leader too uh look I I'm a human being so if I'm really tired from Global Travel and long hours and who knows what I'm not afraid to uh to show that to my people because I think that's sort of a way of being relatable they feel this that too it's human nature sometimes you to be feel overworked and tired um but I think you have to bring Mo for the most part you got to bring your energy to your job every every moment of the the day meaning every waking hour um because it's motivate energy energy is motivating</p>

</details>

**Bob Iger:** 但我认为在日常生活中，这很重要，因为有人可能会说我睡眠不足，但对我来说，早晨的时光实际上是**恢复活力**（rejuvenating）的。首先，它是**冥想性**（meditative）的，很安静。当外面还黑着，没有人起床时，我生活中的**刺激**（stimulation）会减弱。所以我有机会独自思考，这让我有机会整理思绪，也就是说，理清顺序和设定一系列优先级。它让我有机会进行更具创造性的思考。我再说一遍，我不是说我是一个创造者，但就我将要发表的演讲、我将与员工进行的讨论而言，这只是我以更有目的的方式开始一天的方式，而不是一醒来就被所有涌入的信息轰炸。我能以更有条理的方式应对世界和新的一天。

### 技术、人工智能与品牌长寿

**Nicola Tangan:** 谈到技术，我们之前也聊过一些。贵公司已经存在了100年。我读到，一百万家公司中只有45家能存活100年，这相当惊人，对吧？那么，您认为公司能存活100年的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on to um uh technology we talked a bit about it and you know you've been around for 100 years the company that is um I I read that only 45 companies out of 1 million survive 100 years so it's it's pretty amazing right so what do you think is the key to surviving for 100 years</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我对此思考了很多。像您一样，我也研究过伟大的品牌和公司以及它们的**长寿性**（longevity），试图理解为什么有些失败了，有些却能成功多年。包括研究世界上那些伟大的品牌，追溯到20世纪20年代和30年代，当然在我有生之年，50年代、60年代和70年代，有很多伟大的品牌。您出生在60年代，可能能说出70年代甚至60年代的一些品牌，尽管您当时还年轻。它们怎么了？为什么它们没有保持其相关性和经济上的成功？为什么其他公司成功了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've thought about this a lot and like you I've studied basically great Brands and and companies and Longevity and tried to understand why did some fail and and why did some succeed for years and years uh including studying the great brands of the world going all the way back to the 1920s and 30s uh and certainly in my lifetime the 50s and 60s and 70s you know I there were great Brands and you were born in the 60s you probably could name a bunch in the 70s or maybe even the 60s although you were young what happened to them why did they not maintain their relevance and their both their economic success as well and why did others succeed</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我得出的结论是，这很有趣。世界变化如此之快，而且是以如此深刻的方式，几十年来一直如此。为了在一个可能与公司或品牌创立时完全不同的世界中保持相关性，公司往往会放弃核心价值观，而这最终会导致公司的消亡。所以我一直努力理解迪士尼的核心价值观是什么。我们谈论的大部分内容就是我们故事讲述中融入了什么，以及创造力驱动着迪士尼的一切。但关键在于以更相关的方式呈现这些核心价值观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what I've concluded is and it's it's it's quite interesting the world is changing so fast and I'm sure that's been the case for decades and in such profound ways that there's a tendency in order to maintain relevance in in a world that may not look anything like the world that existed when a company or a brand was created there companies have a tendency to maintain relevance to abandon core values and that becomes the death of the company um so what I've tried to do is understand what are the core values of Disney most of it we've talked about which is basically what do we put into our storytelling uh the value of creativity the fact that it drives everything at Disney um but then it's critical to present those core values in more relevant ways</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 所以有时这与你讲述的故事无关，而是它在屏幕上看起来如何？你是否使用了**电脑生成动画**（computer generated animation, CGI: 利用计算机图形学制作的动画）而不是手绘动画？**皮克斯**（Pixar）就是一个很好的例子。手绘动画看起来老旧，相关性较低。电脑生成动画，特别是对新一代人来说，看起来更新、更现代，更符合他们消费时的生活。这只是技术的一种应用，有时是为了讲述同一个故事，但以一种视觉上更相关的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so sometimes it's not about the story you tell it's how does it look on screen are you using and Pixar is a great example computer generated animation versus handdrawn animation handdrawn animation looked old it looked less relevant computer generation particularly to new generations of people looked newer more modern Le more of today or of their lives when they were consuming it uh that's just a an application of technology to tell sometimes the same story but in a visually more relevant way</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 另一个创造相关性的因素是你如何分发你的产品，你的客户如何获取它，以及客户如何消费它。在我们的案例中，一个很好的例子就是**流媒体**（streaming），这是一种现代的故事分发方式。顺便说一句，这很有趣，如果你今天去**迪士尼+**（Disney+: 迪士尼旗下的流媒体服务平台），你会看到1937年的《**白雪公主**》（Snow White）或1928年的**米老鼠**（Mickey Mouse）短片。故事是同一个，但通过现代技术分发，并最终在现代设备上消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">another thing that creates relevance is how you distribute your product how is your customer getting access to it and then how is the customer consuming it so in our case great example would be streaming which is a a modern way of Distributing a story um the same story by the way it's interesting if you go to Disney plus today you'll see Snow White from 1937 or a Mickey Mouse short from 1928 um same story but distributed in modern technology and then ultimately consumed on a modern device</p>

**Nicola Tangan:** 您认为**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的技术）将如何改变您正在做的事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you think how do you think AI will change what you're doing</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我们对此思考了很多，我认为公司在这方面负责任地行事非常重要，因为我认为我们不知道的比知道的更多。我认为在面对人工智能时，谨慎行事至关重要。我们认为技术能让我们真正做到三件事：我们刚刚谈到让我们的故事更好；其次，让它们在分发和消费方面与消费者更相关，这基本上是改善与消费者的关系；最后一部分是让公司更高效。我相信人工智能将能够实现所有这些。它将成为一个强大的工具，在伟大的故事讲述者手中，使故事讲述者能够讲述更好的故事，此外还能提高效率。我认为最终它将使我们能够更多地接触客户，并与他们建立更紧密、可能更亲密的关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I I we think about this a lot and I think it's really really important for companies to act responsibly in this regard because I think there's more that we don't know than we know and I think proceeding with caution is critical when it comes to AI we view technology as enabling us to really do three things we've just talked about make our stories better second become uh make them more relevant to consumers in terms of how they're distributed and consumed so that's a basically improving the relationship with the consumer and the last part is just making company more efficient I believe AI will enable all of that they it will be a a powerful tool to enable in the hands of a great Storyteller to enable that Storyteller to tell better stories in addition more efficiency and I think ultimately enable us to gain more access to and have a closer maybe more intimate relationship with our</p>

**Bob Iger:** 我不想接受的是，人工智能会摧毁人类的创造力。我认为作为一家公司，我们将非常努力地防止这种情况发生。我的意思是，我只是认为人类思维能够以机器无法替代的方式讲述一个伟大的原创故事，希望在未来几十年内如此，如果永远不会被替代的话，这是我的希望。也就是说，故事讲述者实际上是讲述故事的人，他们的故事创造了故事，特别是原创故事。我认为，正如我们多年来所做的那样，正如华特·迪士尼所做的那样，将技术用作故事讲述者的强大工具是很好的。

**Bob Iger:** **史蒂夫·乔布斯**（Steve Jobs: 苹果公司联合创始人）曾将笔记本电脑比作“思想的自行车”。他研究了物种的运动能力，发现人类在没有自行车的情况下，无法快速有效地在空间中移动，但当你给他们一辆自行车时，他们就成了最快的物种。他就是这样看待电脑的。我希望人工智能也能成为这样，这听起来可能有些陈腐，有些天真，因为我知道有很多人，也许出于正当理由，担心它远不止是“思想的自行车”，它是一个强大到足以带来颠覆和破坏的工具，最终会对人类产生负面影响。我认为我们作为人类有责任确保这种情况不会发生。

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，迪士尼经历了一段非常艰难的时期。显然，董事会决定解雇前任首席执行官，这不仅造成了不确定性，也引起了真正的担忧。所以我首先要做的就是平息事态，并向人们保证未来是光明的，我们将采取一些措施，我将非常透明地公布这些措施，让迪士尼重回正轨。我相信公司的文化在许多方面都是一切，而一种尊重和培养伟大创造力的文化，尤其是在迪士尼，至关重要。我必须让创造力重新回到公司的中心。公司以前的重组方式，将一些责任从公司的创意部门剥离了。我必须恢复这一点，我几乎在第一天就做到了。

<p class="english-text">well Disney had been through a really difficult time uh obviously uh the board making a decision to remove the the former CEO you know created not just uncertainty but real concern so I I had to calm the first thing I had to do was really calm things down and and reassure people um that that that the future was bright again and that there were steps we were going to take that I would was going to be very transparent about to get Disney back on track uh I I believe at company's culture is everything in any respects and uh a culture that uh respects and and fosters great creativity particularly at Disney is is critical I had to return creativity to the center of the company it had the company had been restructured in a way that took some of the accountability and responsibility away from the creative side of the company I had to restore that I did that on day one really right away</p>

**Bob Iger:** 我必须再次在公司中灌输乐观情绪，既要现实地认识到我们需要完成多少事情，又要乐观地相信我们能够完成这些事情。我还必须精简组织，更清楚地界定谁负责什么。有很多问题需要解决。

<p class="english-text">um I had to instill optimism again in the company being a realist and how many things we need to accomplish but being an optimist in terms of my confidence that we would be able to accomplish those things um I also had to streamline the organization make it much more clear who was responsible for for what uh there was there there was a lot of fixing that had to be done</p>

**Nicola Tangan:** 最困难的部分是什么？

<p class="english-text">what was the toughest part of it</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 对我来说最困难的部分是保持耐心。我必须习惯这样一个事实，即向上攀登并不那么确定，也不那么容易，而且我们是从一个非常低的起点开始的。我必须在需要多长时间才能达到我感觉公司应该达到的位置上保持耐心。我现在对我们所处的位置感觉非常好。我们还有很多工作要做，天哪，即使我们解决了一切问题，仍然会有工作要做。但我对我们最近的成功以及我们迄今为止作为一家公司所取得的成就感到非常满意，而且我对公司未来的发展轨迹也感到非常乐观。

<p class="english-text">the toughest part for me was to be patient I had to get used to the fact that um The Climb upwards wasn't as certain wasn't as easy uh and that we were starting from a very low point and I had to be patient in terms of how long it would take to get where I felt the company needed to be I actually feel quite good now about where we are we have a lot more work to do and Heavens even if we've fixed everything there still will be work to do but I feel really good about not only the recent successes um and what we've managed to accomplish as a company to date but I feel great about Thea trajectory of our company going forward</p>

**Nicola Tangan:** 对于**完美主义者**（perfectionist）来说，保持耐心困难吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">is it difficult for a perfectionist to be patient</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 对于完美主义者来说，保持耐心几乎是不可能的。这是我的个人挣扎之一。但我认为随着时间的推移，你会学会保持耐心，因为，顺便说一句，我认为表达不耐烦也是好的，因为这能创造一种**紧迫感**（sense of urgency），激励人们不仅要做伟大的事情，还要更快地完成。这是一件好事。但你也必须对此保持现实。要求在不可能的时间内完成事情，对任何人都没有好处。所以，这是关于努力理解，努力让人们尽快朝着正确的方向前进，但要明白积极的结果可能需要一些时间。

<p class="english-text">it's almost impossible for a professionist to be patient that is one of my that is one of my personal struggles I think um but I think over time you teach yourself to be patient because well by the way I think expressing impatience is good too because creating a sense of urgency and motivating people not just to do great things but to do them faster is a good thing but you have to be realistic about it too it doesn't do anybody any good to demand things that that happen on a timeline that is impossible ultimately to achieve so I it's it's trying to understand trying to get people moving as fast as possible in the right direction but understanding that results positive results may take some time</p>

**Nicola Tangan:** 最后一个问题，我们有成千上万的年轻听众。您对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>

<p class="english-text">last question we have um tens of thousands of young listeners um what is your advice to young people</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 嗯，我碰巧相信，如果你能培养自己的好奇心，或者如果你能顺应你内心存在的好奇心，那真的非常重要。一个好奇的人是渴望学习、渴望体验新事物的人，最终也是能够创新的人。所以，找到你内心的好奇基因，尽你所能确保它健康而充满活力，这至关重要。我们谈到了耐心，这在管理职业生涯中很重要。顺便说一句，找到你的热情，但要对发现你的热情保持耐心，然后对你的职业生涯以更自然的方式展开保持耐心，这很罕见。通常机会会降临到那些有准备的人身上，而不是人们完全靠自己创造机会。这方面有太多外部因素。

<details>

<p class="english-text">well I I happen to believe to the extent you can either teach yourself to be curious or to the extent that you can lean into the Curiosity that exists within you that's really important a curious person is someone that wants to learn someone that wants to uh experience new things someone that wants to someone that ultimately is capable of innovating so find that Curiosity Gene within you and do whatever you can to make sure that it is healthy and and vibrant that's critical we talked about patients that's important in managing careers Find Your Passion by the way way but be patient about discovering what your passion is and then be patient about your career unfolding uh in terms of its timing in a n in a more natural way it's it's rare that I usually opportunities come to people that are prepared for them as opposed to people creating opportunities completely on their own there are too many outside factors in that regard</p>
</details>

**Bob Iger:** 我从我的老板们那里受益匪浅，他们恰好在我准备好接替他们工作的时候退休了。例如，这并不是我创造机会，除了我确保自己为机会的到来做好了准备。但也有可能他们决定晚几年退休，我可能仍然会得到他们的工作，但我需要更有耐心。所以我认为耐心很重要。不要为自己设定一个在许多方面超出你控制范围的人为时间表。所以，要好奇，要耐心，找到你的热情，然后尽你所能，甚至更多地投入到你所做的事情中。

<p class="english-text">I I benefited greatly from having um bosses retired just when I was ready to take their job for instance now that's not me creating the opportunity other than I made sure I was prepared for it when it came up U but it could been could have been a couple of cases that they decided to retire a couple of years later I might still would have gotten their jobs but I would had to be more patient about it so I think patience is important don't create an artificial timetable for yourself that in many respects is out of your control so be curious be patient find your passion um and uh and and apply everything you're capable of doing and then some to whatever that is</p>
