### 新年决心：为何多数以失败告终？

大多数新年决心都会失败。因此，在本期视频中，我将探讨它们失败背后的科学原因，以及如何避免这些陷阱，从而让你的新年决心真正成功，我还会分享我为2020年设定的三个新年决心。

<p class="english-text">Most New Year's resolutions fail. So in this video I want to talk about the science of why they fail and how to avoid that so your New Year's resolutions actually succeed and I want to tell you about three of my New Year's resolutions for 2020.</p>
</details>

我的第一个决心是停止浏览新闻网站，我发现这会浪费我大量时间。请不要误解，我确实认为了解世界正在发生的事情很重要，但我只是不认为每天追踪新闻周期的发展是获取信息的好方式。因此，我将改为每周订阅一份报纸送到家里，这就是我保持信息灵通的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first one is to stop going to news websites I find I kill a ton of time by doing that Now don't get me wrong, I do think it's important to know what's going on in the world, but I just don't think following the day-to-day developments of the news cycle is the way to do that so instead I am going to get one newspaper delivered to my house every week and that is how I am gonna stay informed</p>
</details>

研究表明，在新年制定决心比在一年中其他任何时间都更有效。事实上，一项研究发现，在1月1日制定决心的人，六个月后坚持下去的可能性是那些在一年中其他时间制定决心的人的10倍。而2020年1月1日是一个新十年的第一天，所以效果可能会更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Research has shown it is more effective to make resolutions at new years than at any other time of the year. In fact, one study found that people who made resolutions on January 1st were 10 times as likely to stick with them 6 months later than people who made their resolutions at other times of the year And January 1st 2020 is the first day of a new decade so it may be even better.</p>
</details>

题外话：那些想争辩说十年第一天实际上是2021年1月1日的人，虽然从技术上讲你们可能是对的，因为没有“0年”，我们直接从公元前1年进入公元1年，但从所有实际目的和心理角度来看，这个1月1日就是2020年代的第一天，这才是最重要的。所以我认为，这些技术细节并不重要，这个争论应该停止了。2020年代从1月1日开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Side note: those of you who want to argue that the first day of the decade is actually January 1st 2021, while you may technically be correct because there was no year 0, we went straight from 1 BC to 1 AD for all intents and purposes psychologically this January 1st is the first day of the 2020s and that is what matters. So the technicalities I think, are unimportant. Abd this argument should be put to bed The 2020s start on Jan 1</p>
</details>

但现在是坏消息：即使是在新年制定的决心，也极有可能失败。这就是为什么健身房在1月份人满为患，但到了3月份就开始变得冷清。研究发现，只有大约8%的人能够坚持他们的决心直到年底。那么，这是为什么呢？我们又该如何避免这个陷阱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now the bad news: even a resolution made at New Year's will most likely fail which is why gyms are packed in January, but they start to clear out by March what research has found that only around 8% of people can stick with their resolutions through the end of the year So why is this? And, how do we avoid that trap?</p>
</details>

### 误解：改变需要巨大努力

我认为这一切都始于一个**误解**（Misconception: 对事物错误的看法或信念）。哦不，哦不，哦不，哦不。算了。*叹气*。嗯，这本来是视频中我跑步机上跑步的部分，但跑步机坏了。所以我认为这个误解是，人们认为为了在生活中做出重大改变，他们必须付出某种巨大的努力。我的意思是，假设你的目标是跑一场马拉松，你可能会计划每周跑三次十公里，这看起来与最终目标相当匹配。你可能在前几周会感到兴奋并充满动力去做，但到某个时候，这种动力就会减弱，跑十公里会显得太难，然后你就会重新陷入旧习惯。这个误解就是认为你需要“大干一场”，结果就是目标过于雄心勃勃，然后无法坚持下去。我要解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it all starts with a misconception Oh no, oh no, oh no, oooooh no. Foooget. *sigh* Well this was going part of the video where I ran on the treadmill but the treadmill's just broken so I think the misconception is, that people think that in order to make big changes in their lives that they have to make some sort of really big effort I mean let's say your goal was to run a marathon you might plan on running ten kilometers three times a week that seems kind of proportionate to the end goal and you might be excited and really motivated to do it for the first few weeks but at some point that motivation is gonna lag and running 10k is gonna seem too hard and so you're gonna sort of fall back into old habits the misconception is thinking you need to go big, and so being over ambitious with your goals and then not being able to commit and stick to them I'm gonna fix this.</p>
</details>

事实是，如果你选择可以持续实现的小目标，你会做得更好。这正是詹姆斯·克利尔（James Clear）的著作《**原子习惯**》（Atomic Habits: 一本关于习惯养成和目标实现的畅销书）背后的理念，即如果你每天在某件事上只进步1%，它只需要最少的努力，但随着时间的推移，效果会像**复利**（Compound Interest: 利息会加到本金上，产生更多的利息，从而使总额呈指数增长）一样**复合**（Compound: 累积增长）。詹姆斯·克利尔提出了**两分钟法则**（Two-Minute Rule: 任何新习惯都应该简化到可以在两分钟内完成），即“选择一件你可以在两分钟内完成的事情”。所以，如果你想跑马拉松，可以从每天跑两分钟开始。这是你无法以“没时间”为借口的事情，一旦这个习惯养成，你就可以尝试将其扩展到更宏大的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The truth is you're much better off if you pick small targets that you can hit consistently that's the idea behind James Clear's book "Atomic Habits" which is this idea that if you can get just 1% better every day at something, it will take a minimum amount of effort but over time the effects will compound just like compound interest and James Clear proposes the two-minute rule: 'pick something that you can do in just two minutes' So if you want to run a marathon, start by say running two minutes a day that is something that you can't say you don't have time for and once that habit sticks, well then you can try to extend it into something more ambitious</p>
</details>

### 策略一：具体化目标并书面记录

新年决心的下一个问题是它们往往过于模糊。人们最常做的决心是减肥、多锻炼和吃得更好。问题是这些事情都太不具体了，以至于很难知道你是否取得了进展，而且很容易退回到旧习惯。因此，这方面的科学研究表明，你需要具体化，并且写下你的目标。写下目标的人实现目标的可能性会高出40%。仅仅通过动笔这一步，效果就相当显著。我在这里想，你们应该把自己的新年决心写在视频评论区，因为这至少是朝着全年目标承诺迈出的一步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the next problem with resolutions is they are too often vague the most common resolutions that people make are to lose weight, exercise more, and to eat better. the problem is those things are so nondescript that it's hard to know if you're making progress and it's really easy to regress into your old habits so the science around this says you need to be specific AND, write down your goals people who write down their goals are 40% more likely to achieve them that is pretty significant just by taking that step of putting pen to paper and I'm thinking here in this video you should put your New Year's resolutions in the comments because at least that is taking a step towards committing yourself to a goal for the year</p>
</details>

我为2020年设定的第二个新年决心是今年每天都在日计划本上写东西。事实上，我可以更具体一些。嗯，我每天会在这本书里写一个字。我知道一个字可能看起来少得荒谬，没什么用，但我想坚持“从小处着手”的理念，想着如果我养成了每天至少在这每一页上写一个字的习惯，那么也许有些日子我会写不止一个字，这对于规划我的一天会有点帮助，希望我能比不这样做时更有效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My second new year's resolution for 2020 is to write in a daily planner every day of this year In fact I can be more specific than that. Um, I will write one word in this book each day now I know one word might seem unhelpfully ridiculously little to write in this book but I want to commit to this idea of starting small with the idea that if I get in the habit of making the time to at least write down one word on each one of these pages, well then maybe some days I will write more than one word and that will be helpful in terms of planning my day a little bit and so hopefully I will be more productive than I would have been otherwise</p>
</details>

### 策略二：可视化追踪进展

接下来，以一种明显且可视化的方式追踪你的进展非常重要。我将使用西蒙娜·吉尔茨（Simone Giertz）设计的“**每日日历**”（Everyday Calendar: 一种带有每日按钮的物理日历，按下按钮会亮起，用于追踪习惯）。它出奇地令人满意，日历上一年中的每一天都有一个按钮，你可以按下它，灯就会亮起，这真的非常令人满足。所以我认为这会鼓励我每天早些时候写下一个字，这样我就可以去点亮那一天的灯。它的优点在于，这是一种非常直观的方式来追踪我的进展，并且它会放在一个显眼的地方，我随时都能看到。我还会把它放在我2020年一些视频的背景中，这样你们就能看到我实现这个目标的进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then it's really important to track your progress in an obvious and visual way and I'm going to use the everyday calendar by Simone Giertz Oddly satisfying. Where there's a button for every day of the year and you can push it and the light turns on and that is really satisfying so I think this will encourage me to write down a word early in the day so that I can go and turn on the light for that day what's great about this is it's a very visual way to track my progress and to have it in an obvious place where I can look at it all the time and I'll put it in the back of shot for some of my videos in 2020 so you guys can see how I'm progressing towards this goal</p>
</details>

### 策略三：结构化环境，而非依赖意志力

新年决心的第三个主要问题是，人们似乎认为这关乎拥有更多的**意志力**（Willpower: 自我控制和抵抗诱惑的能力）或动力，能够更好地抵制诱惑。但意志力是一种有限的资源，它会耗尽，总会有一些糟糕的日子，那时你就会旧病复发。所以，仅仅依靠意志力并不是一个有效的策略。研究表明，那些拥有更好自控力的人，实际上锻炼自控力的次数反而更少。他们之所以能做到这一点，是通过**环境结构化**（Environmental Structuring: 调整周围环境，使其更有利于实现目标，减少对意志力的依赖），这样他们就不必动用意志力。我发现我的厨房里总是把零食和点心放在台面上，而蔬菜则被塞进保鲜抽屉里。我理解，因为蔬菜就应该放在那里保鲜，但问题是如果我看不到它们，如果它们不在我的视线范围内，我最终只会吃台面上的东西，而不会去翻找蔬菜。所以我们需要一种改变环境的方式，以便我们做出更好的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the third major problem with New Year's resolutions is that people seem to think it's about having more willpower or motivation, being able to resist temptation better but willpower is a finite resource and it can be depleted that there are gonna be some bad days and that is when you're gonna relapse so relying on willpower is not an effective strategy and research has shown that people who have better self-control actually just have to exercise it less the way they're able to do that is by structuring their environments so they don't have to exercise their willpower I find in my kitchen it's always like the treats and snacks which are left out on the counter but the veggies which are like tucked away in the vegetable crisper drawer and I get it because you know that's where the veggies are meant to go to keep them crisp, but the problem is if I don't see them, if they're not in my line of sight, I will just end up eating what's on the counter and not going digging for veggies so we need a way of changing our environments so that we make better choices</p>
</details>

这就引出了我2020年的第三个也是最后一个新年决心：我要从手机上删除社交媒体应用。我将卸载Instagram和Twitter。你正在见证我做这件事的精确时刻。原因是我发现我花在这些应用上的时间太多了。研究表明，你在一天中遇到的任何微小干扰，都会让你花费大约20到25分钟才能重新投入工作。因此，我因为这些应用拖延时间而损失了大量时间。所以我将它们从手机上删除，这样我就不必动用意志力去漫无目的地点击它们，就像我平时那样。我实际上已经下载了一个应用，它会在我工作时屏蔽新闻网站和社交媒体，因为这样我就不必约束自己，我设置的系统会替我约束自己。我知道这听起来有点像CGP Grey（一位以制作解释性视频和播客而闻名的YouTuber），但我认为他抓住了问题的关键。你不需要每天追踪新闻周期的动态，也不需要一直刷社交媒体，尤其是在你试图完成有用的工作时。这就是我的感受，我想通过锁定所有潜在的干扰来优化我的2020年，不需要任何意志力，而且我已经为2020年制定了一些小而具体、书面记录并带有追踪计划的目标。所以我很想知道你们为2020年的新年决心有什么计划？你们对下一个十年有什么计划？

<p class="english-text">which brings me to my third and final new year's resolution for 2020: I am deleting social media apps off of my phone I'm getting rid of Instagram and Twitter. You are watching the exact moment that I do that the reason for this is I find I just kill way too much time going into these apps and research shows that any tiny distraction that you have during your day takes you you know something like 20,25 minutes to get back into your work and so I'm losing a lot of time to just procrastinating with these apps so I'm getting rid of them off my phone so I don't have to use my willpower to not click them mindlessly as I normally would and I've actually downloaded an app that will block news sites and block my social media while I'm working because that way I don't have to restrain myself the systems that I put in place will restrain me for me I know a lot of this sounds a little bit CGP Grey but I think he's on to something you don't need to follow the day-to-day movements of the news cycle and you do not need to be scrolling social media all the time particularly when you're trying to get useful work done so that's how I feel I want to optimize my 2020 by locking down all my potential distractions not needing any willpower, and I've got some small, specific, and written down, targeted with tracking plans for 2020 so I'd love to know what you're planning for 2020 for your New Year's resolutions What are your plans for the next decade?</p>
