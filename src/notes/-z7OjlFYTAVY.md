### 美国政府停摆进入第八天，白宫施压民主党

Good morning. I'm Nathan Hager.

早上好。我是内森·海格。

And I'm Karen Moscow. Here are the stories we're following today.

我是凯伦·莫斯科。以下是我们今天关注的头条新闻。

Karen, we begin on day eight of the federal government shutdown and the White House is ramping up the pressure on Democrats. President Trump is floating the idea of blocking back pay for some federal workers when the government reopens.

凯伦，我们开始关注美国联邦政府停摆的第八天，白宫正在加大对民主党的施压力度。特朗普总统正在考虑在政府重新开放时，阻止部分联邦雇员获得补发工资的想法。

For the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.

“在大多数情况下，我们会照顾好我们的人民。有些人真的不配被照顾，我们会用不同的方式来照顾他们。”

The president spoke from the Oval Office after the White House budget office drafted a memo saying workers are not guaranteed compensation during a shutdown. We get more from Bloomberg's Derk Wallbank.

总统在白宫预算办公室起草了一份备忘录后，在椭圆形办公室发表了讲话，该备忘录称，在政府停摆期间，工人无法保证获得报酬。我们从彭博社的德里克·沃尔班克那里获得更多信息。

There is a substantial amount of question about whether or not that's something he can actually do. Um, but that is the threat that's there. And hanging over all of this is a threat from uh Russ vote the OM director uh to maybe rather than furlow federal workers which they are currently furled to actually go through with permanent job cuts trying to put pressure on Democrats.

“关于他是否真的能做到这一点，存在大量的疑问。嗯，但这确实是存在的威胁。而这一切之上，还有来自 OM 主任罗斯·沃特的威胁，他可能不会像目前那样解雇联邦雇员，而是会进行永久性的裁员，试图向民主党施压。”

That's Bloomberg's Derek Wallbank. In the meantime, the shutdown starting to have a real world impact outside the beltway. Flights at Chicago O'Hare and Dallas Fort Worth airports were delayed by at least a half hour last night due to staffing shortages. Air traffic controllers and other essential staff are still working at the nation's airports, just without pay.

那是彭博社的德里克·沃尔班克。与此同时，政府停摆开始对华盛顿以外地区产生实际影响。由于人员短缺，昨晚芝加哥奥黑尔和达拉斯沃斯堡机场的航班延误了至少半小时。空中交通管制员和其他基本工作人员仍在全国各地的机场工作，只是没有工资。

### 法国总理对解决政治危机表示乐观

In France, Nathan, the countdown underway to salvage the French government. Outgoing Prime Minister Sebastian Lorneu expressed optimism that an agreement can be reached to allow the formation of a new government without fully endorsing a new proposal to rethink a controversial pension law as demanded by the socialists. Bloomberg Daybreak anchor Steven Carroll is in Paris and has the very latest developments.

内森，在法国，挽救法国政府的倒计时正在进行。即将卸任的总理塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽表示乐观，认为可以达成一项协议，允许组建新政府，但并未完全支持社会主义者要求的、重新考虑一项有争议的养老金法律的新提议。彭博社“早间播报”主持人史蒂文·卡罗尔在巴黎，将带来最新的进展。

The centrist and center right parties that he spoke to yesterday have a willingness to agree on a budget by the 31st of December. He says the conversation was steering further away from a dissolution of the parliament. They've agreed that the budget must allow France to advance and to reduce the deficit to below 5% next year. That's interesting because the previous budget target was 4.7% next year. So perhaps an indication of some of the willingness and what's being discussed in terms of changes to spending plans. Now he's going into discussions with the leftwing parties today. Sebastian Loru says he'll be asking them what concessions they're willing to make to try and support a budget plan as well. And he talked more broadly about the risks of what this crisis means to the image of France too to the international uh place on the international stage that France holds as well. But the message from the first day of talks is is that they are working towards a budget agreement. They're working away from the idea of calling fresh National Assembly elections. But Manuel Macron's given Sebastian Loru until this evening to try and come up with a plan and we'll be waiting to see what the next update brings.

“他昨天与之交谈的中左翼和中右翼政党，愿意在12月31日前就预算达成一致。他说，会谈正朝着避免议会解散的方向发展。他们已同意，预算必须使法国能够前进，并将明年的赤字降低到5%以下。这很有趣，因为之前的预算目标是明年4.7%。所以这可能表明了一些意愿以及正在讨论的支出计划的变动。现在他今天将与左翼政党进行讨论。塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽表示，他将询问他们愿意做出哪些让步来支持预算计划。他还更广泛地谈到了这场危机对法国国际形象的风险。但第一天的会谈传递的信息是，他们正在努力达成预算协议。他们正朝着避免提前举行国民议会选举的方向努力。但马克龙总统给了塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽直到今天晚上，让他想出一个计划，我们将等待下一个更新。”

And Bloomberg's Steven Carroll notes that French bonds extended in advance as Lorno spoke. The yield on 10-year bonds fell five basis points to 3.52% the lowest since Friday.

彭博社的史蒂文·卡罗尔指出，在洛尔纽讲话时，法国债券有所上涨。10年期债券的收益率下跌了5个基点至3.52%，为自周五以来的最低点。

### 中东和平谈判在埃及展开

Now Karen, let's get to the latest on efforts for peace in the Middle East. Teams from the US, Qatar, and Israel are gathering in Egypt for final negotiations to end the war in Gaza. Israeli opposition leader Yar Laid says he is hoping for an end to the conflict.

现在凯伦，让我们来关注一下中东和平努力的最新进展。来自美国、卡塔尔和以色列的团队正在埃及举行最终谈判，以结束加沙的战争。以色列反对派领导人亚伊尔·拉皮德表示，他希望冲突能够结束。

A war that is going nowhere, hostages that are slowly dying, and of course the suffering Gaza that everybody in his right mind cares about, children should not die in grown-ups wars. Um, so for everybody's sake, we pray for this to end. Israeli opposition leader Yar Laid made those comments to Sky News. A Hamas spokesperson says a permanent ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza must be central to a deal.

“一场毫无进展的战争，人质在慢慢死去，当然还有加沙遭受的苦难，这是所有头脑清醒的人都关心的问题，孩子们不应该在成年人的战争中死去。嗯，为了大家，我们祈祷这一切能够结束。”以色列反对派领导人亚伊尔·拉皮德向天空新闻发表了这些评论。哈马斯发言人表示，永久停火和以色列军队撤出加沙必须是协议的核心。

### 黄金创纪录新高，人工智能领域融资火爆

We turn now to the markets, Nathan, where gold is continuing its record run. It smashed through $4,000 an ounce for the first time. Concerns over the US economy and a government shutdown are adding fresh momentum to the rally. Bloomberg Markets executive editor Paul Dobson has more in the historical run.

现在我们转向市场，内森，黄金正在继续其创纪录的上涨。它有史以来首次突破了每盎司4000美元。对美国经济的担忧和政府停摆为这次反弹增添了新的动力。彭博社市场执行主编保罗·多布森将对这次历史性的上涨进行详细介绍。

50% just uh this year alone is a pretty impressive statistic. That's against the US dollar. And when you sort of uh um look at the how that compares with history, it's the best annual gain since uh the 1970s. And it's not just that that's kind of noteworthy here. It's also the sort of pace uh at which we're gaining uh in sort of longer term history. If you think about it, we only breached $1,000 an ounce after the financial crisis, 2,000 during the COVID pandemic, but we've gone from 3,000 to 4,000 uh just since March to uh this month. So, um you know, we're really stepping up in terms of that sort of uh big number rate of change.

“仅仅是今年，50%的涨幅就是一个相当令人印象深刻的数字。这是相对于美元而言的。当你回顾历史，与历史相比，这是自20世纪70年代以来最好的年度涨幅。而值得注意的不仅仅是这一点。它还体现在我们增长的速度上，从长远历史来看。如果你想想看，我们直到金融危机后才突破每盎司1000美元，在新冠疫情大流行期间才突破2000美元，但我们从3000美元到4000美元，仅仅是从3月到这个月。所以，你知道，我们在这种大数字的变化率方面确实在加速。”

And that's Bloomberg Markets executive editor Paul Dobson taking a look at Comx gold right now. It's up 1 and a3% up more than $55 at $4,059 an ounce.

那是彭博社市场执行主编保罗·多布森正在关注的COMEX黄金。目前，它上涨了1.33%，上涨超过55美元，达到每盎司4059美元。

Karen, we have new developments this morning involving Elon Musk's push into artificial intelligence. The billionaire startup XAI is raising more than initially planned. Let's get the details from Bloomberg's Gina Cvetti.

凯伦，今天早上我们有关于埃隆·马斯克进军人工智能领域的新进展。这位亿万富翁创立的初创公司XAI正在筹集比最初计划更多的资金。我们请彭博社的吉娜·西维蒂来介绍详情。

Bloomberg News has learned Musk is tapping backers, including Nvidia, to lift the ongoing funding round to 20 billion. Sources say the financing includes equity and debt in a special purpose vehicle that will buy Nvidia processors and rent them to XAI for use in its Colossus 2 project. Nvidia is investing as much as 2 billion in the equity portion of the transaction, a strategy that helps accelerate its customers AI investments. The massive financing is just the latest for the AI industry. Earlier this week, Open AI announced a deal to use advanced micro devices chips over multiple years. Meta Platforms has inked several multi-billion dollar deals in the past few months, including a $29 billion financing package for data centers and Oracle also raised a $ 38 billion debt package for its infrastructure. Gina Cervetti, Bloomberg Radio.

“彭博社新闻获悉，马斯克正在寻求包括英伟达在内的投资者，将正在进行的融资轮提高到200亿美元。消息人士称，这笔融资包括在一个特殊目的实体中的股权和债务，该实体将购买英伟达的处理器，并将其租给XAI用于其Colossus 2项目。英伟达正投资高达20亿美元于该交易的股权部分，这一策略有助于加速其客户的AI投资。这笔巨额融资只是AI行业的最新一笔。本周早些时候，OpenAI宣布了一项多年期使用先进微设备的芯片的协议。Meta Platforms在过去几个月签署了多项数十亿美元的协议，其中包括一项290亿美元的数据中心融资计划，甲骨文也为其基础设施筹集了380亿美元的债务。吉娜·西维蒂，彭博社广播。”

All right, Gina, thank you. Well, Jamie Diamond is weighing in on the AI boom. He says JP Morgan Chase spent $2 billion a year on developing artificial intelligence technology and saves about the same amount annually from the investment. Diamond tells Bloomberg's Tom McKenzie that he celebrates the opportunities offered by AI even if it eliminates some jobs.

好的，吉娜，谢谢你。嗯，杰米·戴蒙就人工智能热潮发表了看法。他说，摩根大通每年花费20亿美元用于开发人工智能技术，并每年节省相同的投资金额。戴蒙告诉彭博社的汤姆·麦肯齐，他赞赏人工智能提供的机会，即使它会消除一些工作。

We have 2,000 people doing it. Spend $2 billion a year on it. It affects everything. Risk, fraud, marketing, idea generation, customer service, and it's kind of the tip of the iceberg. And so, you know, we're deploying it. Every time we meet as a business, we ask, "What are you doing in AI? What are you doing to serve your people? Why can you do better? What is somebody else doing?" So, we're freely deploying it and safely.

“我们有2000人在做这件事。每年花费20亿美元。它影响着一切。风险、欺诈、营销、创意产生、客户服务，这只是冰山一角。所以，你知道，我们正在部署它。每次我们开会时，我们都会问：“你们在人工智能方面做了什么？你们在为人们提供服务方面做了什么？你们为什么能做得更好？别人在做什么？”所以，我们正在自由地、安全地部署它。”

In a letter to shareholders last year, Diamond likened AI technology to the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing, and the internet. Get the full conversation with JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Diamond on the Bloomberg podcast channel on YouTube.

在去年的股东信中，戴蒙将人工智能技术比作印刷术、蒸汽机、电力、计算和互联网。可以在YouTube上的彭博社播客频道收听与摩根大通首席执行官杰米·戴蒙的完整对话。

And finally, Karen Cristiano Ronaldo is soccer's first billionaire. His net worth now stands at $1.4 billion on the Bloomberg billionaires index. The Portuguese player reached the milestone after a lucrative contract extension with Saudi Arabian team Al-Naser, reportedly worth 400 million. But Bloomberg Portugal bureau chief Sophia Horte Costa says Ronaldo's move to the Middle East was controversial. at the time a lot of people were criticizing that decision because you know he was going from Manchester United and playing at really top level football to a very unknown league even in Saudi Arabia wasn't the most successful team

最后，凯伦，克里斯蒂亚诺·罗纳尔多是足球界的首位亿万富翁。根据彭博亿万富翁指数，他的净资产现为14亿美元。这位葡萄牙球员在与沙特阿拉伯球队利雅得胜利续签了一份据称价值4亿美元的丰厚合同后，达到了这一里程碑。但彭博社葡萄牙局局长索菲亚·霍尔特·科斯塔表示，罗纳尔多进军中东的举动在当时颇具争议。当时很多人批评这个决定，因为你知道他将从曼联退役，从顶级足球比赛转投一个非常不知名的联赛，即使在沙特阿拉伯也不是最成功的球队。

and despite endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Armani Bloomberg Sophia Horda Costa says Ronaldo's wealth primarily comes from his playing career

尽管有耐克和阿玛尼等品牌的代言交易，但彭博社的索菲亚·霍尔达·科斯塔表示，罗纳尔多的财富主要来自他的职业生涯。

### 其他新闻速览

time now for a look at some of the other stories making news in New York and around the world. And for that, we're joined by Bloomberg's Michael Bar. Michael, good morning.

现在是时候看看纽约及世界各地的一些其他新闻了。为此，我们请到彭博社的迈克尔·巴尔。迈克尔，早上好。

Good morning, Karen. Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed with the Democratic senators during a contentious hearing on a wide range of issues. In an exchange with Senator Dick Durban of Illinois, Bondi was asked about any conversations that she may have had with the White House about deploying the National Guard to Democratic run cities.

早上好，凯伦。司法部长帕姆·邦迪在一次关于广泛问题的争议性听证会上与民主党参议员发生争执。在与伊利诺伊州参议员迪克·德宾的一次交流中，邦迪被问及她是否曾与白宫就向民主党执政的城市部署国民警卫队进行过任何谈话。

I wish you love Chicago as much as you hate President Trump. We're there to help make America safe and Illinois safe whether or not you want to.

“我希望你爱芝加哥的程度和你恨特朗普总统的程度一样。无论你是否愿意，我们都在那里帮助美国和伊利诺伊州变得安全。”

Ag Bondi was also questioned about the Jeffrey Epstein files, basically saying that there is no evidence that would implicate potential co-conspirators. Matt Vaneps, a former commissioner in Tennessee, Governor Bill Lee's administration, has won a crowded Republican primary in the special election to replace former GOP Congressman Mark Green, who left office this summer. Van Eps clinched Tuesday's victory with 51.6% after an endorsement from President Trump. In the Democratic primary, state representative Aptton Ben won a four-way contest with almost 28% and will face Vaneps in the general election December 2nd. A truck driver has filed a lawsuit against former New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and Fox Corporation following a bloody fight police say was started by Sanchez outside an Indianapolis hotel. The altercation left 69year-old Perry Tol with several injuries. Tol also stabbed Sanchez during the fight. Lead prosecutor Ryan Meers.

邦迪部长还接受了关于杰弗里·爱泼斯坦案卷的质询，基本上说没有证据可以牵连潜在的共犯。田纳西州州长比尔·李政府的前专员马特·范普斯在填补今年夏天离职的前共和党国会议员马克·格林的特别选举中，赢得了一场拥挤的共和党初选。在特朗普总统的背书下，范普斯在周二的选举中以51.6%的得票率获胜。在民主党初选中，州代表阿普顿·本在一场四人竞争中以近28%的得票率获胜，并将于12月2日在普选中对阵范普斯。一名卡车司机已起诉前纽约喷气机队四分卫马克·桑切斯和福克斯公司，此前桑切斯在印第安纳波利斯一家酒店外引发了一场血腥的打斗。此次冲突导致69岁的佩里·托尔受了多处伤。在打斗中，托尔还刺伤了桑切斯。首席检察官瑞安·米尔斯。

Certainly the description from the victim would indicate uh that he was of the of the belief uh that the person that he had the confrontation with was very much intoxicated.

“当然，受害者的描述表明，他认为与他发生对抗的人当时非常醉。”

Prosecutor Ryan Meers also said Tuesday Sanchez faces a felony battery charge and several misdemeanors. Sanchez was in Indianapolis for Fox's coverage of a football game. Global News 24 hours a day and whenever you want it with Bloomberg News Now. I'm Michael Bar and this is Bloomberg. Karen,

检察官瑞安·米尔斯周二还表示，桑切斯面临一项重罪殴打指控和几项轻罪指控。桑切斯当时在印第安纳波利斯为福克斯电视台报道一场足球比赛。24小时全球新闻，随时随地为您提供彭博新闻。我是迈克尔·巴尔，这里是彭博社。凯伦，

thanks Michael. Time now for our Bloomberg sports update and for that we bring in John Stash Hour.

谢谢你，迈克尔。现在是彭博社体育更新时间，我们请约翰·斯塔什·霍尔。

Thanks Karen. The Yankees were in big trouble trailing Toronto two games to none and the Blue Jays led game three six to one, but the Yanks rallied. Aaron Judge had a game-tying three-run homer. Jazz Chisum a go-ahead solo shot. Yanks won 96. The Blue Jays still lead the series 2 to1. Seattle won 84 at Detroit for a 2-1 series lead. 40-year-old Joe Flacco traded from one AFC Central team in Ohio to another. Goes from Cleveland to Cincinnati. The Bengals lost quarterback Joe Burrow to injury. That's your Bloomberg sports update.

谢谢凯伦。扬基队陷入了困境，以两场比赛对零的比分落后于多伦多，蓝鸟队在第三场比赛中以6比1领先，但扬基队奋起反击。阿隆·贾奇打出了扳平比分的3分全垒打。贾兹·奇森打出了领先的全垒打。扬基队以9比6获胜。蓝鸟队仍然以2比1领先系列赛。西雅图以8比4战胜底特律，以2比1领先系列赛。40岁的乔·弗拉科从俄亥俄州的一支AFC中部球队交易到另一支。他从克利夫兰去了辛辛那提。猛虎队失去了四分卫乔·伯罗，他因伤缺阵。以上是您的彭博社体育更新。

Coast to coast on Bloomberg radio, nationwide on SiriusXM, and around the world on Bloomberg.com and the Bloomberg Business App. This is Bloomberg Daybreak.

Good morning. I'm Nathan Hager. As the French political crisis continues, France's caretaker prime minister now has just hours to find a solution to his country's budget and government woes. And as he edges closer to President Emanuel Mcron's deadline, Sebastian Lorno is sounding optimistic.

早上好。我是内森·海格。随着法国政治危机的持续，法国看守总理现在只剩下几个小时的时间来解决国家预算和政府的困境。随着他逐渐接近埃马纽埃尔·马克龙总统设定的最后期限，塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽正表现出乐观的态度。

There is a will to have for France a budget before the 31st of December this year. And this will creates a movement that steers us further away from the dissolution of parliament.

“法国有决心在今年12月31日前通过预算。而这种决心正在推动我们远离议会解散。”

That was Prime Minister Laornu speaking through an interpreter this morning. And for the very latest, we are joined in Paris once again by Bloomberg Daybreak Europe anchor Steven Carroll. So Steven, there's a will to get a budget by the end of the year, but isn't the deadline this month? Good morning.

那是洛尔纽总理今早通过翻译发表的讲话。我们再次连线在巴黎的彭博社“欧洲早间播报”主持人史蒂文·卡罗尔，获取最新消息。史蒂文，有决心在年底前通过预算，但不是这个月的最后期限吗？早上好。

Good morning, Nathan. Yeah, I mean we're into the latest twist of this, but a note of optimism coming from Sebastian Donu. was speaking before what is perhaps the most crucial part of his negotiations. He was going in to talk to the center-left socialist party. They're seen as being the key to the way out of this crisis for Loru to build a broader consensus potentially around a budget plan. And that optimism that he talked about of having the centrist and center right parties on board to try and pass a budget and move away from the idea of fresh national assembly elections would be something that has given markets a bit of a boost. We've seen a reaction on the cat cararant in Paris getting a bit of a spike and the advance in government bond yields also h continuing. We're seeing the drop uh down about four basis points on the tenure and the spread with Germany narrowing as well. So a sense from Sebastian that things went well with his discussions yesterday. But I would point out there are those are his existing partners. What he has to get the socialists to agree to. He said he'd be looking for concessions. He's meeting a whole range of left-wing parties today is what exactly they're willing to agree to. And a lot of the focus now in the conversation has been around the question of retirement reforms and whether the controversial pension reforms passed in France might actually get suspended as part of some sort of deal with the socialist party.

早上好，内森。是的，我们的节目进入了最新的转折点，但塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽传递出乐观的信号。他在进行他谈判中最关键的部分之前发表了讲话。他将与中左翼的社会党进行会谈。社会党被认为是洛尔纽走出这场危机的关键，可以围绕预算计划建立更广泛的共识。他谈到的乐观情绪，即中左翼和中右翼政党能够支持通过预算，并远离重新举行国民议会选举的想法，可能会提振市场。我们看到巴黎证券交易有所反应，略有上涨，政府债券收益率的上涨也在继续。我们看到10年期债券收益率下跌了约4个基点，与德国的利差也在收窄。因此，塞巴斯蒂安表现出昨天会谈进展顺利。但我想指出的是，那是他现有的合作伙伴。他需要获得社会党的同意。他说他会寻求让步。他今天会见了一系列左翼政党，了解他们究竟愿意同意什么。目前对话的重点很大程度上集中在退休金改革问题上，以及法国通过的备受争议的养老金改革是否会作为与社会党达成某种协议的一部分而被暂停。

And that raises the question about whether those kinds of reforms would be agreed to by some of the parties on the right wing.

而这引发了一个问题：右翼的一些政党是否会同意这类改革？

Exactly. And this is where things get extremely complicated and we look at the potential for a split in the existing coalition as well. So Sebastian Lornou is caught in a sort of a game of three-dimensional chess where he's trying to bring new allies on on side without losing his existing ones. But it is interesting to point out that the idea of suspending the pension reforms came from the person who was responsible to for bringing them through parliament, the former prime minister, Elizabeth Bow. Again, another indication of how even in Macron's own party, we're seeing a sort of distancing from some of the president's key reforms as well. Sebastian Nornu is going to speak in an interview on French television this evening. That's around the time we're expecting him to be able to have told the president whether or not there is a way out of this crisis. The hours are ticking down. The meetings are continuing and the pressure is on for Sebastian Lonu.

没错。也正是在这里，事情变得极其复杂，我们也看到了现有联盟可能分裂的可能性。因此，塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽陷入了一场三维象棋般的博弈，他试图争取新的盟友，同时又不失去现有的盟友。但值得注意的是，暂停养老金改革的想法是来自负责将这些改革提交议会的前总理伊丽莎白·鲍恩。这再次表明，即使在马克龙自己的政党内部，我们也看到了一些与总统关键改革保持距离的迹象。塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽将于今晚在法国电视上接受采访。届时，我们预计他将能告诉总统是否有可能摆脱这场危机。时间在流逝。会谈仍在继续，塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽承受着巨大的压力。

At the same time, as you mentioned, we are seeing some relief in the markets, but with some of President Mcronone's traditional allies sort of distancing themselves from him in ways that we've been talking about since yesterday. Does that keep some of the political pressure on him? He's been facing calls from some of his past allies to resign.

与此同时，正如你提到的，我们看到市场有所缓解，但马克龙总统的一些传统盟友正以我们昨天一直在谈论的方式疏远他。这是否会给他带来一些政治压力？他一直面临着一些昔日盟友要求他辞职的呼声。

Yeah, that's right. And and some of those calls are ones that they've been making for quite some time. But the issue now is that Emanuel Macron looks very unlikely to try and resign. Much more likely that there would be National Assembly elections, if any at all. And I suppose the message from Sebastian Lornu seems to indicate that elections are looking like a more distant prospect this morning. Uh on the market reaction though I would point out that if they were to suspend the pension reforms that could be a real impact on markets. Conversations we've been having with the likes of Christopher Dembeck from Pict this morning h talking about it being the biggest risk to France's fiscal outlook which as we know is the origin of this whole crisis to begin with is the fact that they couldn't agree on a budget to reduce the deficit. And if you add to the fact that you're going to add billions of euros of costs of pensions, uh, if you do suspend those pension reforms, that's going to make the situation even more complicated.

是的，没错。而其中一些呼声已经持续了相当长一段时间。但现在的问题是，埃马纽埃尔·马克龙不太可能辞职。更有可能的是，如果举行国民议会选举的话，将会是全民选举。我猜想，塞巴斯蒂安·洛尔纽的表态似乎表明，今天早上选举看起来前景更加渺茫。至于市场反应，我想指出的是，如果他们暂停养老金改革，可能会对市场产生真正的影响。我们今天早上与皮克特公司的克里斯托弗·德姆贝克等人进行了交谈，他谈到这可能是法国财政前景面临的最大风险，而我们知道，这场危机的根源在于他们无法就削减赤字的预算达成一致。如果你考虑到，如果你暂停那些养老金改革，将要增加数十亿欧元的养老金支出，那将使情况更加复杂。
