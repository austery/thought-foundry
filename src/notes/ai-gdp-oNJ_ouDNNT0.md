### 引言：颠覆性创新的投资女王

Host: One of the most disruptive and innovative forces in the **ETF** (Exchange-Traded Fund: 一种在证券交易所上市交易的开放式基金) world today, the investor queen Cathie Wood. The ARK Innovation ETF, trading now near a 52-week high, returned an astounding 148%, and more than 170% last year, now has $17 billion under management.

今天，**ETF**（Exchange-Traded Fund: 一种在证券交易所上市交易的开放式基金）领域最具颠覆性和创新性的力量之一，投资女王凯西·伍德。ARK创新ETF目前正接近52周高点，去年实现了惊人的148%回报，甚至超过170%，目前管理着170亿美元资产。

Cathie Wood: My conviction is so high because of what I do on a day-to-day basis. We are doing original research, trying to figure out these companies that are going to transform the world.

凯西·伍德：我的信念如此坚定，是因为我每天都在做的事情。我们正在进行原创研究，试图找出那些将改变世界的公司。

Host: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome ARK Invest's Cathie Wood.

主持人：女士们先生们，请欢迎ARK Invest的凯西·伍德。

### 创新、GDP增长与低通胀

Cathie Wood: Well, greetings. I'm so delighted to be here. This is my maiden voyage, and I am here to talk about how the world is going to transform during the next 5 to 10 years, how much more rapidly we will see **real GDP** (Real Gross Domestic Product: 剔除通货膨胀影响后的GDP，反映实际经济增长) grow, and how low inflation is going to be and why.

凯西·伍德：大家好。我很高兴来到这里。这是我的首次亮相，我来这里是为了谈论世界在未来5到10年将如何转变，我们将看到实际**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 衡量一个国家或地区经济活动总量的指标）增长的速度会快多少，以及通货膨胀会降到多低以及原因。

Cathie Wood: So here we go. Here is a timeline of innovation. You can see it goes into the 1700s. Our chief futurist, Brett Winton, in conjunction with academics, pulled this together. What you're seeing here is the impact of innovation on productivity, and you can see in this time we've had two great eras.

凯西·伍德：那么我们开始吧。这是一张创新时间线。你可以看到它一直追溯到18世纪。我们的首席未来学家布雷特·温顿与学者们合作整理了这张图。你们在这里看到的是创新对生产力的影响，你们可以看到在这个时期我们经历了两个伟大的时代。

Cathie Wood: The first one was in the late 1800s, early 1900s: telephone, electricity, and the internal combustion engine. This provided a huge boost in GDP growth. In fact, for the 400 years prior to that, real GDP growth had been averaging about 0.6% per year, which was very slow. After that, we went into a 125-year period of 3% real GDP growth. So, that was a five-fold increase from 0.6% to 3%.

凯西·伍德：第一个时代是在19世纪末20世纪初：电话、电力和内燃机。这极大地推动了GDP增长。事实上，在此之前的400年里，实际GDP增长平均每年约为0.6%，非常缓慢。在那之后，我们进入了一个125年的时期，实际GDP增长达到3%。所以，这是一个从0.6%到3%的五倍增长。

Cathie Wood: You have to fast forward to today to see multiple innovation platforms evolving at the same time. For the first time in 125 years, there are five platforms this time, not three major platforms, and they involve 15 different technologies. This is very important in terms of how to research and analyze the world.

凯西·伍德：你必须快进到今天，才能看到多个创新平台同时发展。125年来第一次，这次有五个平台，而不是三个主要平台，它们涉及15种不同的技术。这对于如何研究和分析世界来说非常重要。

Cathie Wood: It's not going to be by sector or industry anymore; it is going to be by technology because technology is permeating every sector, every industry, and blurring the lines between them.

凯西·伍德：它将不再按行业或产业划分；而是按技术划分，因为技术正在渗透到每个行业、每个产业，并模糊它们之间的界限。

Cathie Wood: So you can see five here. We believe that the productivity uplift here is going to be so strong during the next 5 to 10 years. And I think President Trump's tax package is going to turbocharge this, so that real GDP growth will accelerate from the 3% where it has been for the last 125 years towards 7% plus. We think that could be conservative; that's a little more than two times as opposed to the five-fold uplift before. So, get ready.

凯西·伍德：所以你们可以看到这里有五个。我们相信未来5到10年，这里的生产力提升将非常强劲。我认为特朗普总统的税收方案将加速这一进程，使实际GDP增长从过去125年来的3%加速到7%以上。我们认为这可能还是保守估计；这比之前的五倍提升略高两倍多。所以，请做好准备。

Cathie Wood: But the other thing that we think is going to happen is that inflation is going to surprise significantly on the low side of expectations. We would not be surprised to see 0% inflation or less as we exit the tariffs and move forward into this new age of technological explosion.

凯西·伍德：但我们认为将发生的另一件事是，通货膨胀将大大低于预期，令人惊讶。当我们摆脱关税，迈向技术爆炸的新时代时，我们不会对看到0%或更低的通货膨胀感到惊讶。

### 五大创新平台与技术融合

Cathie Wood: One of the reasons for this explosion is not just the five platforms. I should name them: **Robotics** (机器人技术: 涉及设计、建造、操作和应用机器人的技术领域), **Energy Storage** (储能: 储存能量以便日后使用的技术), **Artificial Intelligence** (人工智能: 模拟人类智能的机器能力), **Blockchain Technology** (区块链技术: 一种去中心化、分布式账本技术) and **Multiomic Sequencing** (多组学测序: 结合基因组、转录组、蛋白质组、代谢组等多种生物组学数据进行分析的技术). These are five major platforms involving 15 different technologies. Here you can see why we think we're going to see explosive growth: it is the convergence between and among these technologies.

凯西·伍德：这种爆炸式增长的原因不仅仅是这五个平台。我应该点出它们的名字：**机器人技术**（Robotics: 涉及设计、建造、操作和应用机器人的技术领域）、**储能**（Energy Storage: 储存能量以便日后使用的技术）、**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器能力）、**区块链技术**（Blockchain Technology: 一种去中心化、分布式账本技术）和**多组学测序**（Multiomic Sequencing: 结合基因组、转录组、蛋白质组、代谢组等多种生物组学数据进行分析的技术）。这是涉及15种不同技术的五个主要平台。在这里你可以看到我们为什么认为会看到爆炸性增长：它是这些技术之间和内部的融合。

Cathie Wood: Just to give you two examples of convergence: in the autonomous mobility space, that is the convergence of robotics, energy storage, and artificial intelligence. Each one of those technologies or platforms is following its own **S-curve** (S型曲线: 描述技术或产品生命周期中增长模式的曲线，通常包括缓慢起步、快速增长和成熟饱和三个阶段), and we are moving into the sweet spot of the S-curve now that autonomous taxis are debuting, in the case of Tesla, in Austin and San Francisco. Waymo has been there for a while. Just think about that: one S-curve feeding another S-curve feeding another S-curve. That's why we're going to see explosive growth.

凯西·伍德：举两个融合的例子：在自动驾驶领域，它是机器人技术、储能和人工智能的融合。这些技术或平台中的每一个都遵循其自身的**S型曲线**（S-curve: 描述技术或产品生命周期中增长模式的曲线，通常包括缓慢起步、快速增长和成熟饱和三个阶段），现在随着自动驾驶出租车在奥斯汀和旧金山（以特斯拉为例）首次亮相，我们正进入S型曲线的“甜蜜点”。Waymo已经在那儿运行了一段时间。想想看：一个S型曲线推动另一个S型曲线，再推动另一个S型曲线。这就是我们将看到爆炸性增长的原因。

Cathie Wood: Another example is in the healthcare space. While the autonomous mobility space might be the biggest revenue generator in the short term, we believe that the most profound application of AI is in healthcare, and that's the convergence of sequencing technologies, artificial intelligence, and technologies like **CRISPR gene editing** (CRISPR基因编辑: 一种精确修改生物体基因组的技术). I think this is the sleeper; it's the most inefficiently priced part of the market.

凯西·伍德：另一个例子是在医疗保健领域。虽然自动驾驶领域在短期内可能是最大的收入来源，但我们认为人工智能最深远的应用是在医疗保健领域，那是测序技术、人工智能以及像**CRISPR基因编辑**（CRISPR gene editing: 一种精确修改生物体基因组的技术）这类技术的融合。我认为这是潜在的黑马；它是市场中定价效率最低的部分。

### 股票市场展望：颠覆性创新时代

Cathie Wood: So you can see why it's going to be so important to set up research departments by technology, not by sector or industry. On this last page here, here is what we think is going to happen to the equity market in terms of valuations.

凯西·伍德：所以你可以明白为什么按技术而不是按行业或产业来设立研究部门会如此重要。在这一页，是我们对股票市场估值方面将发生的事情的看法。

Cathie Wood: So you can see in the turquoise there, that's the **MAG Six** (Magnificent Six: 指美国股市中市值最大、表现最突出的六家科技公司，通常包括苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、Meta和英伟达，有时也指剔除特斯拉后的“七巨头”中的六家). It used to be called the MAG Seven, but they threw Tesla out when it wasn't behaving like the rest of the MAG Six. From 2019 to 2024, the MAG Six tripled in valuation in market capitalization. Whereas truly disruptive innovation, shown in purple at the bottom, went up only 30%. That's because investors were playing it safe, investing only in the largest, most cash-rich stocks in the market.

凯西·伍德：所以你可以看到蓝绿色部分，那是**MAG Six**（Magnificent Six: 指美国股市中市值最大、表现最突出的六家科技公司，通常包括苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、Meta和英伟达，有时也指剔除特斯拉后的“七巨头”中的六家）。它以前被称为MAG Seven，但当特斯拉表现不像其他六家公司时，他们将其剔除了。从2019年到2024年，MAG Six的市值估值翻了三倍。而底部紫色部分代表的真正颠覆性创新，仅上涨了30%。这是因为投资者采取了保守策略，只投资市场上最大、现金最充裕的股票。

Cathie Wood: That was a very difficult time for innovation, for venture capital generally. You can see what we expect to happen over the next five years: some of the MAG Six will do well, but some are facing headwinds. Apple's challenges in the AI space are well documented, and now we think it is truly disruptive innovation's time to shine in the market.

凯西·伍德：那对创新和风险投资来说都是一个非常困难的时期。你可以看到我们预计未来五年会发生什么：一些MAG Six公司会表现良好，但有些正面临逆风。苹果在人工智能领域的挑战已广为人知，现在我们认为，是真正颠覆性创新在市场中大放异彩的时候了。

Cathie Wood: I feel as though a rubber band has been stretching for the last four years, and it let go with the election of Donald Trump. That's when truly disruptive innovation started to shine, and the stock market started to broaden out from the very concentrated MAG Six strategies into much more widespread disruptive innovation.

凯西·伍德：我感觉就像一根橡皮筋已经拉伸了四年，而唐纳德·特朗普的当选让它释放了。那正是真正颠覆性创新开始闪耀的时刻，股市也开始从高度集中的MAG Six策略，扩展到更广泛的颠覆性创新领域。

Cathie Wood: In other words, risk appetite and time horizon are starting to extend here. I think the tax package, especially the corporate tax cuts which most people haven't focused on—full depreciation of structures in the first year they're put in service, full expensing of equipment, and **R&D** (Research and Development: 研究与开发) for domestic and software in year one—these are huge, huge incentives to invest now. I think that's exactly what's going to happen.

凯西·伍德：换句话说，风险偏好和时间跨度正在这里延伸。我认为税收方案，特别是大多数人没有关注的企业减税——结构在投入使用的第一年即可完全折旧，设备可全额费用化，以及国内和软件的**研发**（R&D: Research and Development: 研究与开发）费用在第一年即可冲销——这些都是现在进行投资的巨大、巨大的激励。我认为这正是将会发生的事情。

Cathie Wood: You can see the difference here: we would expect truly disruptive innovation, based on a chart we did at the end of last year, to deliver a compound annual rate of return of roughly 50% over the next five years. We've had some of that already, so maybe it's 40% to 45% compound annual rate of change. This is in the public equity world. In the private world, just wait until you see the disclosures. Of course, they know the disclosure.

凯西·伍德：你可以在这里看到区别：根据我们去年底制作的图表，我们预计真正的颠覆性创新在未来五年内将带来大约50%的复合年回报率。我们已经实现了一部分，所以也许是40%到45%的复合年变化率。这发生在公开股票市场。在私人市场，等着看披露吧。当然，他们知道披露。

### 比特币展望与投资策略

Host: Ladies and gentlemen, Cathie Wood. Cathie, join us. Thank you. Thanks for watching. Thank you so much for coming. I know you're very busy.

主持人：女士们先生们，凯西·伍德。凯西，请和我们一起。谢谢。感谢收看。非常感谢您的到来。我知道您很忙。

Cathie Wood: My pleasure.

凯西·伍德：我的荣幸。

Host: You're projecting in 5 years, Bitcoin hits $3.8 million per coin. That's five times the market cap of gold, which has hit an all-time high. Walk us through the math here.

主持人：您预测五年内，比特币将达到每枚380万美元。这相当于黄金市值的五倍，而黄金已创下历史新高。请向我们解释一下这里的计算依据。

Cathie Wood: So, I'm going to just correct that a bit. Our official bull case is $1.5 million.

凯西·伍德：嗯，我得稍微纠正一下。我们官方的牛市预测是150万美元。

Host: Okay.

主持人：好的。

Cathie Wood: What got us to that $3.8 million is using **Modern Portfolio Theory** (现代投资组合理论: 一种通过分散投资来最大化预期收益并最小化风险的投资策略). If we were to include Bitcoin in portfolios at its optimal weight, maximizing the **Sharpe Ratio** (夏普比率: 衡量投资组合风险调整后收益的指标), that would have provided that increment to $3.8 million. Believe it or not, that position size, when we did that analysis, was 19% of a diversified portfolio.

凯西·伍德：我们之所以得出380万美元的预测，是基于**现代投资组合理论**（Modern Portfolio Theory: 一种通过分散投资来最大化预期收益并最小化风险的投资策略）。如果我们将比特币以其最佳权重纳入投资组合，从而最大化**夏普比率**（Sharpe Ratio: 衡量投资组合风险调整后收益的指标），那将使比特币增值到380万美元。信不信由你，当我们进行这项分析时，比特币在多元化投资组合中的仓位达到了19%。

Host: That's a lot.

主持人：那可真不少。

Cathie Wood: That's a lot.

凯西·伍德：确实不少。

Host: Yeah. I have more in mine. Well, you swing for the fences. When your cousins, when civilians ask you, "Hey, how much Bitcoin should I own?" what's the number you would say in private to a family member?

主持人：是的。我自己的投资组合里更多。嗯，你总是敢于冒险。当你的表亲，当普通人问你：“嘿，我应该拥有多少比特币？”你会私下告诉家人一个什么数字？

Cathie Wood: To a family member.

凯西·伍德：对家人来说。

Host: You want to protect them. You're not like, "Hey, we're swinging for the fences. This needs to be our home run."

主持人：你希望保护他们。你不会说：“嘿，我们要孤注一掷，这必须是我们的全垒打。”

Cathie Wood: But I'll tell you what I've told my children for a long time now is to average in. Average in every month, every time, just average in. Then I would leave it to them in terms of their comfort factor.

凯西·伍德：但我一直以来告诉我的孩子们的是要定期定额投入。每个月，每次都定期定额投入。然后，我会让他们根据自己的舒适度来决定。

### 零售投资者的机会与责任

Host: Got it. Cathie, can I ask you about this? So ARK has this ability to be a vehicle for a lot of folks who are just living their normal day-to-day lives, and they want the answer to what is going to do well in the future. They can go and buy your ETFs, and then they can participate in that future. There are a lot of people who are palpably frustrated with an inability to sort of get ahead, break through, and build wealth. First, what is economically happening in America that prevents so many people? What do you see? And second, what characteristics and responsibility do retail investors have? If they're going to "YOLO" (You Only Live Once: 一种冒险投资策略，意指“只活一次”，常用于描述投资者将大量资金投入高风险资产以求快速高回报的行为) this, and if they're going to buy this other thing and try to go further out on the risk spectrum, what is their responsibility so that there's no crying in the casino?

主持人：明白了。凯西，我能问你这个吗？ARK有能力成为许多过着日常生活的普通人的投资工具，他们想知道未来什么会表现良好。他们可以购买你的ETF，然后参与到那个未来中。有很多人明显感到沮丧，因为他们无法取得进展，突破困境，积累财富。首先，美国经济上发生了什么，阻止了这么多人？你看到了什么？其次，散户投资者有什么特点和责任？如果他们要“**YOLO**”（You Only Live Once: 一种冒险投资策略，意指“只活一次”，常用于描述投资者将大量资金投入高风险资产以求快速高回报的行为）这个，如果他们要购买其他东西并试图在风险谱系上走得更远，他们的责任是什么，才能避免在赌场里哭泣？

Cathie Wood: There are many ways to access innovation. We have packaged it up, and we don't look anything like a traditional benchmark. So, if they're diversifying, we're a very good source of diversification, especially in trying to get exposure to innovation. We also have a venture fund. One of the questions I regularly get from retail investors used to be, "Why can't we access the private markets? We know more about those technologies than most of the institutions who are buying them. They have no idea. We're passionate about it."

凯西·伍德：有很多方法可以接触创新。我们已经将其打包，而且我们与传统基准完全不同。所以，如果他们在进行多元化投资，我们是一个非常好的多元化来源，特别是在尝试接触创新方面。我们还有一个风险投资基金。我经常从散户投资者那里得到的一个问题是：“为什么我们不能进入私人市场？我们对这些技术的了解比大多数购买它们的机构都多。他们一无所知。我们对此充满热情。”

Cathie Wood: And so we've gotten more vocal, and this administration is certainly becoming more vocal and more focused on this particular idea because it is un-American, right? To say you have to meet this price.

凯西·伍德：因此我们变得更加敢于发声，而本届政府也确实变得更加敢于发声，并且更加关注这个特定的想法，因为它是不符合美国精神的，对吧？不能说你必须达到这个价格门槛。

Cathie Wood: Well, you use ChatGPT every day, but you can't buy OpenAI.

凯西·伍德：嗯，你每天都使用ChatGPT，但你却买不到OpenAI的股票。

Host: Exactly. But you can buy a lottery ticket or you can bet on sports, and it makes no sense. I do think it's going to change, and I think this administration... How should it change? I've advocated for this before on the podcast, and I believe you've talked about it: only 5-6% of the country are **accredited investors** (合格投资者: 满足特定收入或净资产标准的个人或实体，可以投资未经注册的证券). A small number are **Qualified Purchasers** (合格购买者: 满足更高净资产要求，可以投资更复杂或风险更高的私人基金的投资者). Should we just have a test? You get a license to own a gun, or drive a car, or cut hair in this country. Why not just have a simple accreditation test? You understand diversification, you understand private versus public assets, how to read a balance sheet. Wouldn't that just solve the problem right quick?

主持人：没错。但你可以买彩票，或者赌体育比赛，这根本说不通。我确实认为这种情况会改变，而且我认为本届政府……它应该如何改变？我之前在播客上倡导过这一点，我相信你也谈过：全国只有5-6%的人是**合格投资者**（accredited investors: 满足特定收入或净资产标准的个人或实体，可以投资未经注册的证券）。少数人是**合格购买者**（Qualified Purchasers: 满足更高净资产要求，可以投资更复杂或风险更高的私人基金的投资者）。我们难道不应该只进行一项测试吗？在这个国家，你获得持枪、开车或理发的执照。为什么不只是进行一项简单的资格认证测试呢？你理解多元化，你理解私人资产与公共资产的区别，如何阅读资产负债表。那不就能很快解决问题吗？

Cathie Wood: I used to say what we're doing in the investment world right now would be the equivalent of saying you can't drive because you don't make enough money or you do not have enough net worth.

凯西·伍德：我以前常说，我们现在在投资领域所做的事情，就相当于说你不能开车，因为你赚的钱不够多，或者你的净资产不足。

Host: Take a test. Take a test.

主持人：参加考试。参加考试。

Cathie Wood: We have this big question in the country about polarization of wealth. 50-60% of the country has some exposure to equities, but the people who don't tend to trend towards socialism or handouts. Maybe they don't feel they're part of what we experience, which is we meet great founders, and you get to participate in public and private markets. We get to say, "Yeah, I drove in a **FSD** (Full Self-Driving: 特斯拉公司开发的自动驾驶辅助系统) car when Tesla was private, or I looked at Coinbase when it was private, or Uber. I got the sense I want to put 1% or 2% into that."

凯西·伍德：我们国家有一个关于财富两极分化的重大问题。50-60%的人口接触过股票，但那些没有接触的人倾向于社会主义或福利。也许他们不觉得自己是我们所经历的一部分，那就是我们遇到伟大的创始人，并且可以参与公开和私人市场。我们可以说：“是的，当特斯拉还是私有公司时，我开过**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 特斯拉公司开发的自动驾驶辅助系统）汽车，或者我研究过私有公司时的Coinbase或Uber。我感觉我想把1%或2%的资金投入其中。”

Host: Yes. Yeah, it does feel profoundly unfair, doesn't it?

主持人：是的。没错，这确实让人感到非常不公平，不是吗？

Cathie Wood: Yes. Yes.

凯西·伍德：是的。是的。

### 市场风险管理与埃隆·马斯克的薪酬

Host: Cathie, there are a lot of market signals right now that are flashing green, and there are a lot of market signals that are flashing red. Do you feel that you have to position actively to all of those things, or do you say, "I can't control this; I need to look five years out"? So how do you manage the risk, and how do you view the markets today?

主持人：凯西，现在有很多市场信号闪烁着绿色，也有很多市场信号闪烁着红色。您是否觉得必须积极地应对所有这些情况，还是说“我无法控制这些；我需要放眼未来五年”？那么，您如何管理风险，以及您如何看待今天的市场？

Cathie Wood: Yes, the risk question is one we get a lot because our portfolios are volatile; they don't look like the benchmarks. When markets enter a bearish period, investors tend to hug their benchmarks, and we're moving in the opposite direction. I just want to say we do what we do, and that's what our advisors expect. They don't expect us to raise cash or do anything. That might be their decision, right?

凯西·伍德：是的，我们经常被问到风险问题，因为我们的投资组合波动性很大；它们不像基准指数。当市场进入熊市时，投资者倾向于紧抱基准指数，而我们则朝着相反的方向前进。我只想说我们做我们该做的事，这也是我们的顾问所期望的。他们不期望我们增持现金或做任何事情。那可能是他们的决定，对吗？

Cathie Wood: In terms of what we do to control risk during bear markets, we will concentrate towards our highest conviction names. We have a scoring system based on management, execution, moat or barriers to entry, product, service, leadership, valuation (importantly), and thesis risk. With those scores, we concentrate during bull markets—which I do believe we are in a bull market that is broadening out. We tend to diversify because **IPOs** (Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股，指公司首次将其股票向公众出售) start appearing again, and we have more information on some of the companies we've sold during the bear market.

凯西·伍德：至于我们在熊市中如何控制风险，我们会集中投资于我们最看好的股票。我们有一个评分系统，基于管理层、执行力、护城河或进入壁垒、产品、服务、领导力、估值（这点很重要）和理论风险。根据这些分数，我们在牛市中集中投资——我确实相信我们正处于一个正在扩大的牛市中。我们倾向于多元化，因为**IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股，指公司首次将其股票向公众出售）再次出现，而且我们对一些在熊市中卖出的公司有了更多信息。

Host: Give us your read on Elon's trillion-dollar pay package.

主持人：请谈谈您对埃隆·马斯克万亿美元薪酬方案的看法。

Cathie Wood: You know what's so interesting about it? This happened with the first model we put out. We put out a model once a year for Tesla, with our price target five years out. We looked at his first package and said, "That looks like our model." We looked at this one and said, "That looks like our model."

凯西·伍德：你知道这有什么有趣的地方吗？这在我们发布第一个模型时就发生过。我们每年都会发布一次特斯拉的模型，以及我们未来五年的目标价。我们看了他的第一个薪酬方案，说：“这看起来和我们的模型很像。”我们又看了这个方案，也说：“这看起来和我们的模型很像。”

Host: And your 10-year forecast has Tesla at $8.5 trillion.

主持人：而您的十年预测是特斯拉达到8.5万亿美元。

Cathie Wood: Right, and we put out five years.

凯西·伍德：是的，我们发布的是五年预测。

Host: Yeah. Yeah.

主持人：是的。是的。

Cathie Wood: If he delivers on humanoid robots the way he thinks he is, we don't have enough in there. So our price target is $2,600. I think it's at $330 today, something like that.

凯西·伍德：如果他能像他所想的那样实现人形机器人，那我们的预测就太保守了。所以我们的目标价是2600美元。我想今天大概是330美元左右。

Host: Exactly.

主持人：没错。

Cathie Wood: Yes, $2,600. And we have very little for humanoid robots in our model. But what Elon is capitalizing on is this convergence that I mentioned: robotics, energy storage, and AI. That convergence in the robo-taxi space is pretty much the same convergence in the humanoid robot space.

凯西·伍德：是的，2600美元。而且我们在模型中对人形机器人的预测非常少。但埃隆正在利用的，正是我提到的这种融合：机器人技术、储能和人工智能。这种在机器人出租车领域的融合，与人形机器人领域的融合几乎是相同的。

Host: Do you underwrite compensation as part of your model? Meaning, when you look at a package like that, if you compare it to other CEOs, like Zuck or whomever, with different styles of compensation—Bezos famously took no compensation post-IPO—how do you think about that as a motivating factor or a necessary condition in 2025 to get results?

主持人：您是否将薪酬作为模型的一部分进行评估？也就是说，当您看到这样的薪酬方案时，如果将其与其他CEO（比如扎克伯格或其他人）的不同薪酬方式进行比较——贝佐斯在IPO后 famously 没有领取薪酬——您如何看待它在2025年作为激励因素或必要条件来取得成果？

Cathie Wood: I think it's huge. I wish more CEOs would do this. Elon's not going to be paid unless he reaches these milestones either. So I think it's very motivating to him. I think it's also an incentive to shoot for the stars, but to do it in a very first-principles way. Everything's physics-based and everything's milestone-based. And he's very disciplined. If people do not know that, they should. And when a milestone is missed, he's in there on the floor.

凯西·伍德：我认为这非常重要。我希望更多的CEO能这样做。埃隆也不会得到报酬，除非他达到这些里程碑。所以我认为这对他是非常大的激励。我也认为这是一种激励，促使他追求卓越，但要以非常第一性原理的方式来做。一切都基于物理，一切都基于里程碑。而且他非常自律。如果人们不知道这一点，他们应该知道。当一个里程碑未能达到时，他会亲身投入其中。

### 公司治理与特拉华州问题

Host: Final quick question. As a stock picker, do you care where the companies are incorporated? Do you look at Delaware now and say there's fundamental business risk? Do you cajole these folks now to maybe reincorporate in different places?

主持人：最后一个简短的问题。作为一名选股人，您是否在意公司的注册地？您现在是否会审视特拉华州，并认为存在根本性的商业风险？您现在是否会劝说这些人考虑在其他地方重新注册？

Cathie Wood: We're not an activist investor. I have to be very careful and say that we are moving out of Delaware, as our own business.

凯西·伍德：我们不是激进投资者。我必须非常谨慎地说，我们作为自己的公司正在迁出特拉华州。

Host: Why? You don't trust them to be predictable? Is that the issue?

主持人：为什么？您不相信他们能保持可预测性吗？问题出在这里吗？

Cathie Wood: They're not predictable now, and they're activist.

凯西·伍德：他们现在不可预测，而且他们是激进的。

Host: Activist.

主持人：激进的。

Cathie Wood: Activist, in a bizarre way. What business do they have overriding the shareholders of Tesla when it comes to a pay package? And all those shareholders who did that drive-by lawsuit twice—they did it twice.

凯西·伍德：激进，而且是以一种奇怪的方式。在薪酬方案问题上，他们有什么资格凌驾于特斯拉的股东之上？还有那些两次提起“路过式”诉讼的股东——他们做了两次。

Host: Yes.

主持人：是的。

Cathie Wood: I mean, it's unbelievable that guy owned 10 shares. He did a "**20-bagger**" (20倍股: 指股价上涨20倍的股票) and then he's got the right to take away.

凯西·伍德：我的意思是，那个人只拥有10股，这简直令人难以置信。他获得了“**20倍股**”（20-bagger: 指股价上涨20倍的股票）的回报，然后他有权夺走。

Host: Cathie, it's kind of... Cathie Wood. Cathie Wood, thank you so much for sharing so much knowledge.

主持人：凯西，这有点……凯西·伍德。凯西·伍德，非常感谢您分享这么多知识。

Host: You're amazing. Thank you so much for taking the time.

主持人：您太棒了。非常感谢您抽出时间。

Cathie Wood: Great to see you all. Thank you.

凯西·伍德：很高兴见到大家。谢谢。
