title: 霍华德·马克斯论投资哲学：市场效率、宏观预测与风险管理
summary: 橡树资本（Oaktree）联合创始人霍华德·马克斯深入探讨了其投资哲学，强调了在投资中做出有意识、有目的选择的重要性。他解析了市场效率假说，并指出投资者必须决定是追求平均回报还是冒风险争取超越平均回报。马克斯强烈批评了宏观预测的无效性，主张采取自下而上的投资策略。此外，他还重新定义了风险，认为真正的风险在于“糟糕结果的可能性”，而非简单的波动性，并强调风险管理是专业投资者的核心职责。

### 开篇致辞与投资哲学引言

非常感谢格雷格（Greg）今天与我们分享他的知识，也感谢尼古拉（Nikolai）和挪威银行投资管理公司（**Norges Bank Investment Management**：挪威主权财富基金的管理者）今天举办这次活动。当我有机会讨论投资哲学时，我说没有比这更好的方式来度过我的生日了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I want to thank Greg for sharing his knowledge with us today and Nikolai and NBIM for hosting us today and when I was offered the chance to discuss investment philosophy I said there's no way I'd rather spend my birthday.</p>
</details>

我对投资哲学极其感兴趣，我认为它必须支撑我们所做的一切。我的观点是，我们的行为必须经过深思熟虑和有目的性，因此我们的方法论也必须如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm extremely interested in investment philosophy, uh I think it has to undergird everything we do, my argument is that our Behavior has to be uh well thought out and intentional uh and so our methodology has to be as well um and um uh you'll hear that it's different but at least we have thought it out and it is intentional.</p>
</details>

它始于一个有意识的决定：你想要实现什么目标。这听起来可能很简单，比如我们想要更多的钱，更高的回报，但任何投资组织的首要问题应该是：我们是满足于平均水平，还是想努力超越平均水平？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um it starts with uh a conscious decision as to what you want to accomplish now this may sound easy well we want to have more money rather than less we want to have a higher return rather than less uh but the the starting question for any organization in investing should be will we will we settle for average or do we want to try to be above average.</p>
</details>

### 平均表现与超越平均表现的选择

这听起来像是一个简单的问题，但你必须认识到，在投资中，达到平均水平极其容易。你可以购买现成的产品，它们将保证你获得平均表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now that sounds like an easy one but you have to recognize that investing it's extremely easy to be average you can buy off-the-shelf products that will guarantee you that you'll do average or you can try to be above average which is extremely difficult and there is no shorefire uh solution to how to get there and if you try to be above average it exposes you to the risk of being below average the two are inseparable so thoughtfully consciously intentionally which is it for you and your organization.</p>
</details>

或者你可以尝试超越平均水平，这极其困难，并且没有万无一失的解决方案。如果你尝试超越平均水平，你就会面临低于平均水平的风险，这两者是密不可分的。所以，对于你和你的组织来说，是深思熟虑、有意识、有目的地选择哪一个呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or you can try to be above average which is extremely difficult and there is no shorefire uh solution to how to get there and if you try to be above average it exposes you to the risk of being below average the two are inseparable so thoughtfully consciously intentionally which is it for you and your organization.</p>
</details>

接下来，我相信一个组织必须拥有自己的信条，一种信仰，即它相信什么，不相信什么，会做什么，不会做什么，因为它不信任某些东西。你必须坚持这些信条，并且再次强调，这必须是有意识和有目的的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh next um you I believe that an organization has to have a Creed a religion the things it believes in the things it doesn't believe in the things it will do the things it won't do because it doesn't trust them and you have to stick to it and uh again it has to be conscious and intentional now I wish the print was big so I could see it I uh I could probably see it if I do a little bit of this but um but the truth is we have to make decisions what will be our intention what do we believe in will we trust macro forecasting or will we uh abstain from it will we um pardon me uh uh how do you think about risk will you take a high risk approach or a low risk approach which is your rot rout uh to uh success it it's not the same for everybody um do you believe in the efficient market this is extremely important it's uh the most important concept I took away from my uh graduate uh education at the University of Chicago in the late 60s um uh many people understand the concept very few people incorporate it and think about it in their daily lives these are some of the things that we have to consider.</p>
</details>

我们必须做出决定：我们的意图是什么？我们相信什么？我们会相信宏观预测吗，还是会避免它？我们如何看待风险？你会采取高风险方法还是低风险方法？哪条路是通往成功的？这并非适用于所有人。你相信**有效市场假说**（Efficient Market Hypothesis：认为资产价格充分反映所有可用信息的理论）吗？这极其重要，它是我在60年代末芝加哥大学研究生教育中最重要的收获。许多人理解这个概念，但很少有人在日常生活中将其融入并思考。这些都是我们必须考虑的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the truth is we have to make decisions what will be our intention what do we believe in will we trust macro forecasting or will we uh abstain from it will we um pardon me uh uh how do you think about risk will you take a highrisk approach or a lowrisk approach which is your rot rout uh to uh success it it's not the same for everybody um do you believe in the efficient market this is extremely important it's uh the most important concept I took away from my uh graduate uh education at the University of Chicago in the late 60s um uh many people understand the concept very few people incorporate it and think about it in their daily lives these are some of the things that we have to consider.</p>
</details>

### 理解市场效率

所以，我们首先谈谈市场效率的概念。市场效率理论认为，有很多人，他们都精通数字、聪明、积极、客观且理性，他们都想实现你所追求的目标，那就是最终比开始时拥有更多的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so let's talk first about the concept of market efficiency now uh the the theory of market efficiency is that there are a lot of people out there and they're all numerate intelligent highly motivated objective and rational and they all want to accomplish the thing you do which is to end up with more money than you started with given the scope of competition how will you be the one who accomplishes the goal rather than them not easily uh thought out.</p>
</details>

在如此激烈的竞争下，你如何成为实现目标的那个人，而不是他们？这并非易事。我们所说的**有效市场假说**（Efficient Market Hypothesis）的“强式形式”指出，由于这些情况，所有信息都会立即融入资产价格中，以至于没有人能找出哪些是便宜货，哪些是被高估的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um now the the uh what we call the uh strong form of the efficient market hypothesis says that due to these circumstances all information is immediately incorporated into the price of assets to the extent that no one person can figure out uh which are the bargains and which are the overpricing.</p>
</details>

真正“强式形式”的说法略有不同，它认为由于这种密集的处理过程，资产价格总是正确的，你无法击败它们，因此你无法击败市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now the the really strong form is actually a little different it says that the prices of assets as a result of this intensive uh process are always right you can't beat them and so you can't beat the market.</p>
</details>

我不认为这是正确的。我认为价格不一定总是正确的，它们只是共识所能达到的最佳水平，而任何一个人都很难持续地比共识更聪明。这是两回事。但两者的底线是一样的：你无法击败市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I don't think that's right I think the prices are not necessarily right they're just the best that the consensus can do and it's hard for any one person to be smarter than the consensus consistently two different things but the um but the bottom line on both is the same you can't beat the market.</p>
</details>

所以问题是，你是否接受这一点？这会促使你采取被动投资方法，目标是平均表现、低成本、低风险，并且极有可能成功实现你的目标，即达到平均水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the question is do you accept that and that that pushes you toward a passive approach targeting uh average performance low cost low risk highly likely to succeed to approach to to accomplish your objective which is being average.</p>
</details>

或者，你是否会在如此激烈的竞争面前，尝试超越平均水平？你是否会承受成本？你追求超越平均水平的努力是否会让你暴露在低于平均水平的风险中？你是否会参与这种成功可能性不大的卓越表现追求？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or will you try to be above average in the face of the very strong competition that exists will you endure the costs will your pursuit of being above average uh permit you to be exposed to the risk of being below average and will you engage in this pursuit of superior performance uh which is not that likely to succeed.</p>
</details>

你知道，我在芝加哥大学学到的第一件事是，平均而言，大多数人在扣除费用前表现平均，扣除费用后低于平均。当时（1968年）的想法是，为什么他们不直接购买**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个包含美国500家大型上市公司股票的指数）中每只股票的一股呢？当时还没有讨论**指数基金**（Index Funds: 旨在复制特定市场指数表现的投资基金）或指数化，这些概念尚未被发明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">U you know the first thing I learned at University of Chicago was that on average most most people do average before fees and below average after fees and the thought at the time 1968 was well why don't they just buy one share of every stock in the S&P 500 there was no discussion of index funds or indexation these had yet to be invented Jack basically by Jack Bogle at Vanguard in 74 but you can see where the concept went and uh today most uh mutual fund Equity Capital has managed past ly or through indexation so it it was not irrelevant it was persuasive.</p>
</details>

杰克·博格尔（Jack Bogle）在74年于先锋基金（Vanguard）基本上发明了它们，但你可以看到这个概念的发展方向。今天，大多数股票型共同基金的股权资本都是通过被动管理或指数化来管理的。所以它并非无关紧要，而是很有说服力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jack basically by Jack Bogle at Vanguard in 74 but you can see where the concept went and uh today most uh mutual fund Equity Capital has managed past ly or through indexation so it it was not irrelevant it was persuasive.</p>
</details>

你会尝试积极主动并超越平均水平，还是被动并保持平均水平？你是否有能力找到并雇佣能实现这一目标的人，或者作为外部经理人？当平均表现为X，而少数人公布了远超X的表现时，你的老板会说：“是谁签下了平均表现这个蠢主意？”这些都是问题，但对于选择投资方法来说，理解和反映市场效率的概念是极其基础的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">will you try to be active and be above average or passive and be average do you uh have the uh people in hand who can accomplish it or the ability to find those people and and hire them as outside managers um what happens uh at the moment when uh you know uh average performance is X and a few people publish performance which is much better and your bosses say who's the idiot who signed on for average performance um so these are questions but it's very fundamental to the selection of an investment approach to understand and reflect the concept of market efficiency.</p>
</details>

### 收益来源与宏观预测的局限性

接下来是了解回报的来源。你可以拥有一个平均投资组合并获得平均表现，或者你可以说：“我认为这家公司将发布其他人未曾预料到的积极消息，即积极的惊喜。”如果你能找出哪些公司会带来积极惊喜，你就可以在投资组合中增加这些公司的权重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the next is coming where is knowing where uh Returns come from um you can have an average portfolio and do average or you can say well this is a company that I think is going to deliver positive news which is unanticipated by others positive surprises and if you can uh figure out which ones will deliver positive surprises you can overweight your portfolio uh toward those and then when the news comes out and it can forms with your view uh everybody else says oh I wish I had more they go out and buy it that forces the price up you are an above average performer so that's the root how uh regularly can it be accomplished that's the question.</p>
</details>

当消息公布并与你的观点一致时，其他人会说：“哦，我希望我能多买一些”，他们就会去购买，这会推高价格，你就会成为一个超越平均水平的投资者。这就是实现这一目标的方法，但问题是，这能多经常实现呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh everybody else says oh I wish I had more they go out and buy it that forces the price up you are an above average performer so that's the root how uh regularly can it be accomplished that's the question.</p>
</details>

如果你与众不同地思考，你就拥有我们所说的“异类认知”（deviant perception）。异类认知，你有多大几率是正确的，而不是共识正确而你错误呢？这再次是事情的核心，你面对的是聪明的竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you think different from others you have what we call a deviant perception deviant perception how often will you be right as opposed to the consensus being right and you being wrong um uh this is uh at the heart of things again you're up against intelligent competition.</p>
</details>

你知道，当我刚开始在一个大型官僚机构的股票部门工作时，人们会问：“你认为你能为我们赚多少？”答案是12%。那么你是如何得出12%的呢？嗯，**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数）平均每年上涨10%，当时已经持续了60年。所以如果你不费吹灰之力就能获得10%，那么稍微努力一下，你应该能获得，比如说，20%更好的表现，也就是12%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh you know when I started my career at a large and bureaucratic institution uh in the equity Department people would ask well what do you think you can make for us and the answer was 12% well how do you arrive at 12 well the S&P 500 does 10 on average has done at that point in time for 60 years so if you can get 10 without any effort you should be able to get well let's say two 20% better with a little elbow grease in other words 12.</p>
</details>

但如果世界上所有的努力都一无所获，因为市场是有效的，你无法获得优势，那么这不仅是精力的浪费，也是管理费用的浪费。当然，管理费用是投资世界中唯一确定的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what if all the elbow grease in the world doesn't accomplish anything because the Market's efficient and you can't get an advantage then it's not only a waste of effort but it's a waste of management fees uh that and of course management fees are the only certainty in the investing world.</p>
</details>

现在，另一个重要问题是，你是否会押注**宏观预测**（Macro Forecasting: 对整体经济指标如GDP、通胀、利率等进行预测）？每个人都在做宏观预测，但我认为它们没有任何用处。这有点夸张，但也不算太离谱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now another important question is will you bet on macro forecasts everybody makes macro forecasts and yet I don't believe that they are of any use that's a mild exaggeration but not so great um the truth of the matter is that most of the time things continue as they are so a forecast of extrapolation is correct most of the time and most people share that view most people expect extrapolation extrapolation of the recent Trends the long-term trends is Incorporated in security prices so when the extrapolation turns out to be correct it's not a profitable expectation because everybody else had it as well it was in the price you paid.</p>
</details>

事实是，大多数时候事情会保持原样，所以趋势外推的预测大多数时候是正确的，大多数人也持这种观点。大多数人预期趋势外推，近期趋势和长期趋势的外推都已融入证券价格中。因此，当趋势外推被证明是正确时，它并不是一个有利可图的预期，因为其他人也持有同样的预期，它已经反映在你支付的价格中了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the truth of the matter is that most of the time things continue as they are so a forecast of extrapolation is correct most of the time and most people share that view most people expect extrapolation extrapolation of the recent Trends the long-term trends is Incorporated in security prices so when the extrapolation turns out to be correct it's not a profitable expectation because everybody else had it as well it was in the price you paid.</p>
</details>

真正有利可图的预测是那些预示着趋势的剧烈偏离，即与外推法截然不同的预测。当你做出这些预测并且它们是正确的时候，它们非常重要。问题是，它们并不经常正确，因为大多数时候事情都是外推的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the forecasts that are very profitable are the ones that call for um uh radical deviation from Trend radical deviation from extrapolation these are very significant when you make them and they're right the trouble is they're not right very often because most of the time things are extrapolated and so we have forecasts of extrapolation which are usually correct but not profitable and forecast of Devi uh deviation from Trend which are potentially very profitable but not often correct.</p>
</details>

所以我们有趋势外推的预测，它们通常正确但不盈利；以及偏离趋势的预测，它们可能非常有利可图但并不经常正确。我从这个分析中得出结论：宏观预测是无效的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I take that an analysis to mean macro forecasting doesn't work and uh one of when we started oak tree 29 years ago this month uh we sat down and we wrote out the things we had been doing because we had the benefit of having worked together for 9 years already on average and uh we have a very simple investment philosophy of six points which governs everything we do and number five says that our actions are not driven by macro forecasts we are bottomup investors selecting IND individual companies not top down selecting markets and countries so that's a different we think we can get an uh an advantage by the way where does outperforming come from in short it comes from having a a knowledge advantage and you have to know something better than most other people to to outperform just trying is not going to help you if you don't know something they don't know so um we think we can get a knowledge advantage in studying the micro companies Industries and securities not the macro countries markets and rates for example so you know we bar that from our approach.</p>
</details>

29年前的这个月，当我们创立橡树资本（Oaktree）时，我们坐下来写下了我们一直在做的事情，因为我们已经平均合作了9年。我们有一个非常简单的六点投资哲学，它指导着我们所做的一切。第五点说，我们的行动不受宏观预测驱动，我们是**自下而上投资者**（Bottom-up Investing: 专注于分析个别公司和证券，而非宏观经济趋势），选择个别公司，而不是**自上而下**（Top-down: 从宏观经济趋势和市场层面出发，再选择具体投资标的）选择市场和国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and number five says that our actions are not driven by macro forecasts we are bottomup investors selecting IND individual companies not top down selecting markets and countries so that's a different we think we can get an uh an advantage by the way where does outperforming come from in short it comes from having a a knowledge advantage and you have to know something better than most other people to to outperform just trying is not going to help you if you don't know something they don't know so um we think we can get a knowledge advantage in studying the micro companies Industries and securities not the macro countries markets and rates for example so you know we bar that from our approach.</p>
</details>

我们认为我们可以通过这种方式获得优势。顺便说一句，超越表现从何而来？简而言之，它来自于拥有“知识优势”。你必须比大多数人更了解某些东西才能超越表现，仅仅尝试是无济于事的，如果你不知道他们不知道的东西。所以，我们认为我们可以通过研究微观公司、行业和证券来获得知识优势，而不是宏观的国家、市场和利率。例如，我们把这一点排除在我们的方法之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um we think we can get a knowledge advantage in studying the micro companies Industries and securities not the macro countries markets and rates for example so you know we bar that from our approach.</p>
</details>

我的一位英雄是约翰·肯尼斯·加尔布雷思（John Kenneth Galbraith），他说我们有两种预言家：一种是不知道的，另一种是不知道自己不知道的。几十年来我一直知道自己不知道，所以我认为我们在这方面有优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I one of my heroes is John Kenneth gallb who said we have two kinds of forecasters the ones who don't know and the ones who don't know they don't know and I've known for decades that I don't know so I think we have an advantage in that.</p>
</details>

宏观预测听起来似乎是徒劳的，但事实是，它的影响可能比中性更糟，甚至具有破坏性。我引用了美国幽默家兼小说家马克·吐温（Mark Twain）的话：“让你陷入麻烦的不是你不知道的事情，而是你确信无疑但实际上并非如此的事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then uh that kind of sounds like forecasting macro forecasting is unavail unavailing but the truth is that it can be worse than neutral in its effect it can be damaging in its effect and I quote the American humorist and novelist uh Mark Twain who said it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble it's what you know for certain that just ain't true.</p>
</details>

任何以“我不知道，但是……”或“我可能错了，但是……”开头的句子从未让人陷入麻烦。让你陷入麻烦的句子是那些说“我确信那是这样那样的”的句子，因为如果你强烈相信某事并重仓押注，而你错了，那就会让你陷入大麻烦。

<details>

<p class="english-text">no sentence that starts with I don't know but or I could be wrong but ever got anybody into trouble the ones that get you into trouble are the ones that say I'm sure that's such and such because if you believe something strongly and You Bet On It heavily and you're wrong that's how you get into big trouble.</p>
</details>

那么，你是否会押注宏观预测？在我看来，这是一个关键且具有决定性意义的决策。一年半前，我想大概是2022年10月，我写了一篇题为《知识的幻觉》（The Illusion of Knowledge）的备忘录。它基本上是对宏观预测的抨击，每一节都以一句著名的引语开头。我认为决定你是否会从自上而下的宏观预测开始是极其重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so will you bet on macro forecasting this in my opinion is a critical and and uh overarching decision I wrote a memo U year and a half ago I think it was October of 22 um entitled the illusion of knowledge and it's a it's basically a rant against uh uh macro forecasting starting with a macro for a famous quote in each section um and uh I I think it's it's extremely important to decide will you or won't you start from a top- down macro forecast and most people do many people know they don't work they do it anyway and one of the I quote somebody in there as saying that most people couldn't get out of bed in the morning if they admitted how uncertain the the future is uh and so I believe that macro forecasting uh in my view often takes the form of uh can I say organized religion it gives Something to Believe In to dispel uh the great uncertainty uh present in the world they live in um and uh you know I believe that uh very few people have the ability uh to do it in a superior fashion.</p>
</details>

大多数人都会这样做，许多人知道它们不起作用，但他们仍然这样做。我在其中引用了一个人的话，他说大多数人如果承认未来是多么不确定，早上就无法起床。因此，我相信宏观预测在我看来，常常以一种——可以说——有组织的宗教形式出现，它提供了一些可以相信的东西，以消除他们所处世界中巨大的不确定性。而且，我认为很少有人能够以卓越的方式做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and most people do many people know they don't work they do it anyway and one of the I quote somebody in there as saying that most people couldn't get out of bed in the morning if they admitted how uncertain the the future is uh and so I believe that macro forecasting uh in my view often takes the form of uh can I say organized religion it gives Something to Believe In to dispel uh the great uncertainty uh present in the world they live in um and uh you know I believe that uh very few people have the ability uh to do it in a superior fashion.</p>
</details>

### 重新思考风险

那么下一个问题是，你和你的组织将如何看待风险？什么是风险？你知道，在投资业务中所有的公式和数学工作中，人们都使用结果的**波动性**（Variability: 衡量投资回报偏离其平均值的程度，常被用作风险指标）作为风险的衡量标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now the next question is how will you and your organization think about risk what is risk um you know in in all the uh formula uh mathematical work in the investment business people use variability of results as the measure of risk I don't think that's the real risk I think the real risk is the risk of bad outcomes uh but um the trouble with my form of risk is it's not measurable you can't measure what the probability of bad outcomes is in the future you can't even measure what the probability of bad outcomes was in the past you can only measure what happened which is a subset of what could have happened.</p>
</details>

我不认为那是真正的风险。我认为真正的风险是“糟糕结果的风险”。但是，我的风险形式的问题在于它不可衡量。你无法衡量未来糟糕结果的概率，你甚至无法衡量过去糟糕结果的概率，你只能衡量已经发生的事情，而这只是可能发生的事情的一个子集。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that's the real risk I think the real risk is the risk of bad outcomes uh but um the trouble with my form of risk is it's not measurable you can't measure what the probability of bad outcomes is in the future you can't even measure what the probability of bad outcomes was in the past you can only measure what happened which is a subset of what could have happened.</p>
</details>

在上一张幻灯片中，我引用了伦敦商学院教授埃尔罗伊·迪姆森（Elroy Dimson）的话，他说：“风险意味着可能发生的事情比实际发生的事情更多。”传统的风险观点如下图所示：垂直轴是回报，水平轴是风险，一条线向上倾斜至右侧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I on the last slide I I had a quote from Elroy Dimson who was a pressor professor at the London Business School he said risk means more things can happen than will happen the conventional view of risk is shown in this graphic here you have return on the vertical axis risk on the horizontal access and a line that swopes up to the right and mathematicians call this positive correlation if one goes up the other goes up most practitioners take this to mean that riskier assets have higher returns there's something wrong with that formulation if riskier assets could be counted on to have higher returns by definition they wouldn't be risky.</p>
</details>

数学家称之为**正相关**（Positive Correlation: 指两个变量同向变动，一个增加时另一个也增加）。如果一个上升，另一个也上升。大多数从业者认为这意味着风险较高的资产具有较高的回报。这种表述有问题，如果风险较高的资产可以指望获得较高的回报，那么根据定义，它们就不会是风险资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mathematicians call this positive correlation if one goes up the other goes up most practitioners take this to mean that riskier assets have higher returns there's something wrong with that formulation if riskier assets could be counted on to have higher returns by definition they wouldn't be risky.</p>
</details>

所以我的看法更像是这样：我把这些小钟形曲线叠加在同一条线上，它是同一条基础线，但现在当你从左向右移动时，不仅预期回报增加，可能结果的范围也变得更广，糟糕的结果也变得更糟。我认为这才是风险，这才是人们应该关注的，而不是他们的回报流可能会不平稳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the the way I look at it is more like this I take these little bell-shaped curves I superimpose them on the same line it's the same underlying line but now as you move from left to right not only does the expected return increase but the range of possible outcomes gets wider and the bad outcomes become worse that I think is risk that is what people should concern themselves not the possibility that their return streams will be lumpy.</p>
</details>

巴菲特（Warren Buffett）说过：“我宁愿要波动性大的15%回报，也不要平稳的12%。”我认为这很有道理。

<details>

因此，我认为专业投资者最重要的工作是管理风险。格雷格在他的演讲中说：“你相信什么？”我认为这非常重要。你可以在他的演示中听到他们花了多少时间来评估、管理和平衡风险。我们也必须做同样的事情，我们必须评估和管理风险，尽管我们是从自下而上的微观层面，而不是自上而下地进行。

<p class="english-text">so I think the most important job of the professional investor is to manage risk and uh you know Greg in his talk said what do you believe in and I think that's very important and you you could hear in his presentation how much of the time they devote to assessing managing and balancing risk and we have to do the same thing we have to assess it and manage it even though we do it from a bottomup micro level not to down but um I think that you have to constant work with uh risk but you have to never assume as Mark Twain cautions uh that you know it for certain we never know what is going to happen and the events show that in the world we never know how the market will react to What happens in the short run uh and if you want proof of those two statements take a look at the US presidential election of 2016 everybody was confident of two things Hillary would win 80% probable and if by some Quirk of f Fe Trump won the market would collapse instead Trump won and the market went up for 14 months 30% so we don't know and uh we don't ever assume that our uh intellectual process permits us to get uh the risk under control.</p>

但我认为你必须不断地处理风险，但你绝不能像马克·吐温（Mark Twain）告诫的那样，认为你确切地知道它。我们永远不知道会发生什么，世界上的事件表明我们永远不知道市场在短期内会对发生的事情做出何种反应。如果你想证明这两句话，看看2016年美国总统大选。每个人都确信两件事：希拉里·克林顿（Hillary Clinton）会赢，概率是80%；如果唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）因某种命运的奇特安排赢了，市场就会崩溃。结果特朗普赢了，市场却上涨了14个月，涨幅达30%。所以我们不知道，我们从不认为我们的智力过程能让我们控制风险。

### 卓越回报与低风险的权衡

最后，你必须接受，很难同时获得卓越回报和低风险。追求卓越回报意味着承担一些风险，你必须押注风险较高的公司、风险较高的提议，那些被认为不受欢迎和失宠的事物，以及如果你错了，将导致你低于平均水平的事物。

<p class="english-text">and then lastly you have to accept that it's very hard to have both Superior returns and low risk um uh a high degree of safety taking going for Superior returns meaning means taking some risk you have to either bet on riskier companies riskier propositions things that are considered unpopular and out of favor and things that if you're wrong will result in your being below average.</p>

你必须自己弄清楚你的方法是什么。我是一个网球爱好者，去年夏天在观看网球锦标赛，特别是温布尔登网球公开赛时，我写了一篇题为《更少的输家还是更多的赢家》（Fewer Losers or More Winners）的备忘录。

<p class="english-text">yet and you have to figure out for yourself what your approach is I'm a player and last summer while watching uh the tennis tournaments uh especially Wimbleton um I wrote a memo entitled fewer losers or more winners.</p>
</details>

在我看来，你必须有一种方法来组织你对卓越回报的追求，这实际上有两种方式：你要么拥有更多表现高于平均水平的东西，要么拥有更少表现低于平均水平的东西。当然，你也可以两者兼顾，但考虑到大多数人的心态，其中一种可能性更大。

<p class="english-text">you have to have an approach in my opinion which will uh organize your pursuit of superior returns and there's really two ways to do it you have to either have more of the things that do above average or less than the less of the things that do below average there is no alternative of course you could do both I think for most people given their mentality one or the other is more likely.</p>

理论上，保守的人可以拥有更少表现不佳的东西；理论上，有技巧的激进者可以拥有更多表现出色的东西。每个人都必须了解自己的心态，以及对他们来说什么是可能的，从而决定他们的追求是什么。

在我看来，这些要素结合在一起，就构成了投资哲学的组成部分。我们在橡树资本就是这样做的，每个人都知道我们的立场，每个人都朝着同一个方向努力。非常感谢大家。
