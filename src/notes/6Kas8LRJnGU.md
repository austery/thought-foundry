### 何为优秀的投资者？

一位优秀的投资者，应将充满激情的好奇心与对真理的不懈追求相结合，整合多样化的信息以获得独特的见解，创造性地连接不相关的数据，并不断积累知识，成为一台学习机器。对我而言，一个安全且支持性的组织文化至关重要。这种文化在公开的异议、从失败和成功中协同学习以及相互关怀中蓬勃发展。培养这种环境需要集体努力，但最终能将一个组织提升到超越个体贡献的高度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A good investor combines passionate curiosity with the relentless pursuit of truth, integrating a diverse set of information to gain unique insights, creatively connect unrelated data, and continuously accumulate knowledge to be a learning machine. For me, a safe and supportive organizational culture is essential. It thrives on open disagreement, collaborative learning from failures and successes, and mutual care. Cultivating this environment requires collective effort but ultimately elevates an organization beyond the individuals' contributions.</p>
</details>

在我看来，一位优秀的投资者是拥有良好策略的人，他真正理解市场，真正理解你的投资组合，以及你所做的事情为何有意义。其次是执行力：你如何建立头寸，如何退出头寸，如何管理风险和回撤。如果你两者兼备——一个好的策略和稳健的执行力——那么你可能就走上正轨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me, a good investor is someone who has a good strategy, really understands the market, really understands your portfolio, and why the stuff you do makes sense. And second is execution: how you step into positions, how you step out of positions, how you manage risks and drawdowns. If you have both of those—a good strategy and sound execution—then you actually might be on to something.</p>
</details>

一位优秀的投资者需要有足够的信心去遵循自己的信念，并进行逆向押注，与市场共识背道而驰，因为流行的观点并不总是正确的。然而，要警惕你的自负，当新信息出现时，要保持开放和足够谦逊的态度来改变你的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A good investor needs to be confident enough to follow your conviction and take contrarian bets, going against market consensus, because popular opinion is not always correct. However, beware of your ego; be open and humble enough to change your mind when new information appears.</p>

### 开启关于投资哲学的深度探索

那么，你究竟如何成为一个更优秀的投资者？这是今天在挪威银行举行的这场会议的主题。我们刚才看到的是我们基金中四位最优秀、最聪明的投资组合经理，他们谈论了在他们看来，什么造就了一位优秀的投资者。今天，我们将深入探讨这个问题，并向最顶尖的人士学习。我们非常荣幸地欢迎大家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do you actually become a better investor? That is the topic for today's conference here at Norges Bank. What we just saw was four of our best and brightest portfolio managers in the fund talking about what in their opinion makes a good investor. Today, we get to dive deep into this question and learn from the very best, and it is our great pleasure to welcome you all.</p>
</details>

今天的主题就是学习成为更优秀投资者，甚至可以说是卓越投资者的秘诀。我们为您准备了四个激动人心的环节，分别关于投资哲学与策略、建立成功的投资组织、造就更优秀投资者的心理因素，以及卓越投资者的行为特质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today is all about learning the secret sauce of what makes a better investor, some might even say an excellent investor. And so we have four exciting sessions lined up for you on investment philosophy and strategy, on building successful investment organizations, the psychological elements that go on to making better investors, and the behavioral aspects of excellent investors.</p>
</details>

现在是时候开启第一个环节了，关于投资哲学与策略。我们的第一位演讲者是格雷格·詹森（Greg Jensen），他是桥水基金（Bridgewater Associates）的**首席投资官**（Chief Investment Officer, CIO: 负责公司投资策略和资产配置的最高级别高管），负责监管公司的投资引擎。他不仅是一位卓越的投资者，还是人工智能领域的百强人物之一，并且是世界扑克系列赛的金手链持有者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's time to kick it off, the first session on investment philosophy and strategy with our first speaker of today. Greg Jensen is the CIO of Bridgewater Associates, where he oversees their investment engine. Not only is he an excellent investor, Greg also is one of the top 100 people in AI, and he is also a gold bracelet holder from the World Series of Poker. So please join me in welcoming Greg to the stage.</p>
</details>

### 桥水基金格雷格·詹森：卓越投资的系统化路径

非常感谢你们邀请我。当我思考我们的哲学时，这实际上是关于让你达到卓越的哲学。卓越对我们来说是核心。在我们用来定义我们哲学的不同词语中，我认为关键在于真正专注于像“卓越”这样的流行词的含义。对我们而言，我们用持续改进来衡量卓越。每个人都从某个地方开始，问题在于，你作为一个个体和作为一个组织，能否持续改进。这就是我们对卓越的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, thank you for having me. So when I think about our philosophy, and this is really about the philosophy that gets you to be excellent. Excellence is so core to us. And as I go through the different words that define our philosophy, I think it's trying to really focus on what do you mean by a buzzword like excellence. And for us, we measure excellence by what we mean by it is continuous improvement. Everybody starts somewhere, and the question is, can you as an individual and you as an organization continuously improve? That's what we would define as excellent.</p>
</details>

桥水基金在过去50年的整个存在期间，一直在做两件事。我在桥水已经29年了，我们专注于两件事：深入理解经济系统如何运作，并将其应用于构建卓越的投资组合。因此，作为一个组织，我们正努力在这方面做到卓越，这意味着要持续改进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if I start with what we are trying to be excellent at, and Bridgewater's been doing two things for its whole existence, 50 years. I've been at Bridgewater for 29 years, and we focus on two things, which is to deeply understand how the economic system works and apply that to build great portfolios. So we're trying as an organization to be excellent at that, which means to continuously improve that.</p>
</details>

要真正理解我们的哲学，有三个关键组成部分。第一是我们所说的“基本面”。基本面意味着真正驱动市场的是什么。我们相信你可以理解这一点，人们会做出决策，他们做决策是有原因的，这些原因加起来就是我们所说的基本面。这些想法你可以从质性上思考，并非所有你认为重要的事情都能用传统的量化方式衡量。但无论如何，这就是我们所说的基本面，即你在世界上看到的现象背后的真正原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's three components that are critical to really understand our philosophy. One is what we mean by fundamental. So fundamental means what actually drives markets. That we believe that you can understand this, that there are decisions that people make, they make them for reasons, those reasons add up to what we consider the fundamentals. That those ideas, you can think of them qualitatively. They're not like, not everything that you're thinking matters is measurable in a traditional qualitative sense. But in any event, that's what we mean by fundamental, which is what are the true causes for the things that you see in the world.</p>
</details>

我们采取的第二步是将你所相信的一切系统化。我们所说的系统化，是指有严谨的态度，把你大脑中的理由提取出来。这可能是一个质性的想法，但你大脑中的神经突触之所以这样做是有原因的。有输入信息进入，有逻辑应用于这些输入，然后有输出。你可以花精力将这种理解系统化，这至关重要，我稍后会谈到为什么这对我们如此重要。最后一件事是，要有一个应对错误的策略。我们应对错误的策略是**多元化**（Diversification: 将投资分散到不同资产类别以降低风险的策略），但也有不同的策略。但你需要知道，无论你以多大的信心相信某件事，你都会犯很多错误。这就是我要深入探讨的三个核心要点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the second step that we take is to take whatever you believe and systemize it. What we mean by that is have the rigor to take the reason that's in your brain. It could be a qualitative idea, but there is a reason the synapses in your brain are doing what they're doing. And somehow there are inputs coming in, there's logic being applied to those inputs, and outputs coming out. You can take the energy to systemize that understanding, and it's critical. I'll talk about why that for us anyway, that's so important. And the last thing is have a strategy for being wrong. Our strategy for being wrong is diversifying, but there's different strategies. But you need to know that whatever you believe with whatever confidence, you're going to be wrong a tremendous amount. So those are the three kind of core things I'll dig a little bit deeper on.</p>
</details>

首先，我们所说的基本面是什么？当我们试图发现关于市场和经济的真相时，有哪些真理是无论你身处世界何处，无论在历史的任何时刻都成立，并且我们期望在未来的任何时刻也同样成立的？对我来说，其中首要的一点是，在市场中赚钱有两种核心方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first off, what could we mean by fundamental? What are truths that when we try to discover what's true about markets and economies, there are things that are going to be true now, that are true wherever you place yourself in the world, that are true at any moment in history, and we expect to be true at any moment in the future. For me, the first one of those things we'd start with is that there's two ways, two core ways to make money in markets.</p>
</details>

一种是承担风险，这是风险转移给你，有人愿意付钱给你，因为你处于一个可以承担他们不想承担的风险的位置。这个大类我们称之为**贝塔**（Beta: 衡量一项投资相对于整个市场波动的风险指标，也泛指承担市场系统性风险所获得的回报）。关于贝塔的含义存在一些语义上的争论，但对我们来说，它就是指你因承担他人风险而获得的报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One is to take on risk. That's a risk transfer to you that somebody's offering to pay you because you're in a position to take risk they don't want to take. That's what that general category we call that beta. Not to be too, like, there's semantic arguments about what beta means, but for us, we just mean the amount of money you get paid for taking on somebody else's risk.</p>
</details>

还有一个独立的点是**阿尔法**（Alpha: 指投资组合相对于市场基准（Beta）的超额回报，衡量的是投资经理的择时和选股能力），这是你可以通过在时机、估值等方面做出明智决策而赚到的钱，这超出了仅仅承担风险的范畴。所以我们思考如何将这两者分开，并将每一项投资视为风险中性头寸加上贝塔——也就是你持有的资产类别和你正在转移的风险——再加上阿尔法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then there's a separate point which is Alpha, which is the money you can make by making smart decisions in terms of timing, in terms of valuation, etc., that go beyond just taking on the risk. So that we think about trying to separate that and think of every investment as the risk neutral position plus the beta. So what the asset classes are that you hold and the risk that you're transferring, plus the alpha.</p>
</details>

我们看待它的方式非常不同。这种关于如何获得总投资组合回报的公式，与大多数组织构建其投资的方式不同。大多数组织认为他们的总回报是他们在每个资产类别中的持仓——股票、债券、私募股权等等的总和。区别在于，你不必将你的阿尔法与你的贝塔结合起来。你可以将这两个决策分开，这是一个很大的不同。所以，首先要理解这两种回报流，认识到它们是不同的，以及你将它们结合在一起的方式实际上可以显著改善你的投资方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's very different the way we look at it. That sort of formula of how you get a total portfolio return is different than how most organizations structure their investments. Most organizations think of their total return as their holdings in each asset class: holdings in stocks, holdings in bonds, holdings in private equity, etc., etc. And those sum up. And the difference is you don't have to combine your Alpha with your beta. You can separate those two decisions, and that's a big deal. So first of understanding those two return streams, recognizing they're different, and the way you can combine them together can actually significantly improve how you invest.</p>
</details>

现在，当我们回到基本面，思考什么是永恒和普适的基本面时，你能对市场说出哪些在100年后仍然成立，在中国、在美国、在挪威这里都成立的话？因为你真的希望将你的信念建立在根本为真的事物之上，然后围绕这些事物建立深刻的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now when we come back to fundamentals and we think about what are fundamentals that are timeless and universal, what can you say about markets that's going to be true 100 years from now, it's true in China, it's true in the United States, it's true here in Norway? Because you really want to base your beliefs on things that are fundamentally true and then build out the deep understanding about those things.</p>
</details>

举两个我们所说的永恒和普适事物的例子。第一，任何东西的价格都等于花在它上面的货币量除以它的数量。这看起来很简单，但实际上蕴含着深刻的理解，比如要花多少钱买某样东西，它的供应量有多少。你可以从根本上构建这个模型，可以在任何时间、任何国家构建。我稍后会谈到我们如何检验这些事情在任何地方都是真实的。同样，某物的价格等于影响它的贴现经济状况。所以当你看到价格变化时，那是因为相对于该资产中已贴现的经济状况发生了某些事情。这两件事在任何时候、任何地方都是真实的，它们是构建流程的重要基石。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to give you two examples of what we mean by things that are timeless and universal, the first is that the price of anything is equal to the amount of currency spent on it divided by its quantity. That seems simple, but it's actually a world of understanding to say, well, how much money is going to be spent on something, how much supply of it exists. And you can fundamentally build that, you can build that in any time, in any country. And I'll get into how we check that those things are true anywhere. Similarly, the price of something is equal to the discounted economic conditions that affect it. And so when you look at the changes in prices, it's because something happens relative to the discounted economic conditions in that asset. Those two things are true all the time and everywhere, and those are big building blocks to then build a process around.</p>
</details>

我们从1980年开始就在构建流程来衡量这些因果关系，衡量我们认为是真实的事物。现在我想谈谈系统化决策。你为什么要这么做？这太麻烦了，对吧？为什么我必须写下我的信念？为什么我必须压力测试它是否为真？大多数人都想跳过这一步，因为他们觉得“好吧，看起来这会发生或那会发生”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we've been building processes to measure that, to measure those cause-effect linkages of things that we believe to be true, you're really starting in 1980. So the first thing I'd say now would talk about making decisions systematically. Why do you do this? It's so such a pain, right? Why do I have to write down what I believe? Why do I have to stress test whether it's true? I mean, most people want to skip that step because it's like, okay, it seems like this is going to happen or that's going to happen.</p>
</details>

在我们组织中，坚持“不，我们要有纪律，总是写下我们的推理”已经成为一个巨大的基石。所以当我们谈论系统化决策时，这并非一个量化问题，而是关于有纪律地说明“这就是我做这件事的原因”。这开启了一个全新的世界。如果你看那张黄色的纸，那是我们1980年的债券系统。在1980年，你可以想象桥水基金就是一张写满了规则的黄纸。上面写着：如果发生这种情况，我们就买债券；如果发生那种情况，我们就卖债券。这些是关于当时我们对货币供应和其他事情看法的规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's been such a huge building block in our organization to say, no, we're going to have the discipline to always write down our reasoning. Right? So when we talk about making decisions systematically, this is not a quantitative thing. This is about having the discipline to say, this is why I'm doing what I'm doing. That opens up a world. So if you look at the yellow piece of paper that's up there, that was our 1980 bond system. So in 1980, you can picture Bridgewater, it was yellow piece of paper rules that were written out. This is, we're going to buy bonds if this happens, we're going to sell bonds if that happens. That were rules about what we thought about money supply and other things at the time.</p>
</details>

这个想法本身并没有那么有用，但它启动的流程至关重要。我们只是划掉其中一个想法，换上另一个，再学习一个新的。但你从这个基石开始：你相信什么？这样组织中的其他人就可以质疑它。这迫使你真正陈述你的逻辑，从而实现持续的复合式改进。这确实是我们哲学中如此关键的一个要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The idea itself is not that useful, but the process that it kicked off was critical, which is we just scratched out one of those ideas, put in another one, learned another one. But you start with this building block of what do you believe so that others in the organization can question that. It's forcing you to actually state what your logic is, and that allows constant compound improvement. That's really such a critical element to our philosophy.</p>
</details>

这样做的好处是你可以自我检验。这里我展示的只是一个例子。如果你说，“好吧，让我说说我的想法。”现在你可能会想，嗯，美国**产能利用率**（Capacity Utilization: 衡量一个经济体中实际产出与潜在产出之比的指标）很高，经济过热，这可能导致工资上涨，或许还有更高的通胀，因此我想在市场上采取这个头寸。强迫自己去做的伟大之处在于，“好吧，这看起来合理，让我们写下来，看看这是否为真，什么时候为真，如果使用这个规则，它在历史上是否真的有效？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the benefit of that is you can check yourself. So what I'm showing here is just an example. If you said, okay, let me say what I think right now. You might think, well, the capacity utilization in the United States, like the economy is running hot, and that running hot could lead to higher wages and maybe higher inflation, and therefore I want to take this position in markets. And the great thing about forcing yourself to, okay, that seems reasonable, like let's write it down, let's see if that's true, when is it true, if you use that rule, will it actually work in history?</p>
</details>

强迫自己经历这个过程，把自己置于不同的时间点，这会迫使你完善你的思维。如果你只是采纳那个想法，那就像是我最近听到的一个观点，我就把它写下来了。然后你可以用技术来测试，“好吧，假设你遵循那个规则，它有效吗？”你会发现，大多数时候，实际上很多时候它并不奏效。现在你会想，“我肯定不知道我在说什么，这难道不可靠吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Force yourself through that, put yourself at different points in time, that'll force you to refine your thinking. If you just take that idea that's like just something I've, you know, recently heard a fair amount, so I just wrote it down so it could show. And then you could, you know, have technology to just test, okay, well, let's say you follow that rule, does it work or not? And what you find most of the time is actually a lot of time it doesn't work. So now you think, well, I must not know what I'm saying, isn't that reliable?</p>
</details>

我展示了那个规则的阿尔法利润曲线，它在很长一段时间内表现不错，但在过去35年里是平的。为什么会这样？为什么这被市场定价了？发生了什么？写下你的规则的好处是，你实际上可以看到它们是否有效，这是一个巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I show like a profit curve of the alpha of that rule, and it's actually okay for a long period of time and then flat for the last 35 years. Why would that be? Why is that getting priced into markets? What's going on? And the benefit of writing down your rules is you could actually see whether they work, and that's a huge, huge deal.</p>
</details>

除此之外，你还可以知道你将面临什么。对于我们用来投资的每一个想法，我们都从我们对它的期望开始。这张锥形图说明了这一点，但我们用于投资的每一个想法，我们都会说，“好吧，我们期望这个想法在未来会带来什么样的风险和回报？”这给了我们一个机会，去比较实际发生的情况与预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Beyond that, you can also know what you're in for. For every idea that we ever use to invest, we start with what do we expect from it. And so this cone chart illustrates this, but every idea that we use in investing, we say, okay, what are the risk and the return that we expect from this idea in the future? And that gives us a opportunity to then compare what happens relative to that.</p>
</details>

锥形图是我们第一次提出这个想法的时候，比如在1991年，我们开始了“纯阿尔法”（Pure Alpha）的想法，也就是把我们当时所有的阿尔法想法整合在一起。之后我们不断增减，但我们设定了一个锥形图，说“这就是我们期望未来风险回报的样子”。每天我们都会标记实际发生的情况与预期的对比。我们对每一个想法都这样做，这是一种自动的质量控制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the cone chart is when we first started the idea. So in 1991, as an example, we started the idea of of Pure Alpha, which is all of the alpha ideas we had at the time put together. And then we've added to them and subtracted from them. But we set out a cone chart and said, this is what we expect the risk return to look like into the future. And every day we mark what's happening relative to that expectation. And we do that with every single idea, which is automatic quality control.</p>
</details>

你可以说，“好吧，如果我的想法没有按照我预期的方式发展，那么，世界和我所想的不同。”另一方面，如果那个想法出现了回撤——这是总会发生的——你提前为此做好了计划。你不是在对回撤做出反应，而是说，“好吧，如果我遇到这种性质的回撤，我不会感到困惑，因为我知道它会发生，我预料到了。”所以，知道什么是你预期范围内的，什么不是，是另一个关键要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could say, okay, if my idea doesn't work out consistent with how I expected it to, then okay, the world's different than what I thought. And on the other hand, if there are drawdowns in that idea, which there always will be, you plan for it in advance. You're not reacting to that drawdown. You're saying, okay, if I have a drawdown of this nature, I'm not perplexed by it because I knew it would happen. I expected that to happen. So knowing what's inside the bounds of what you expect and what's not is another critical element.</p>
</details>

### 霍华德·马克斯：投资哲学的信条与实践

我想感谢格雷格与我们分享他的知识，也感谢尼古拉和挪威银行投资管理公司今天主办这次活动。当我有机会讨论投资哲学时，我说没有比这更好的方式来度过我的生日了。我对投资哲学极其感兴趣。我认为它必须支撑我们所做的一切。我的论点是，我们的行为必须是深思熟虑和有意的，因此我们的方法论也必须如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to thank Greg for sharing his knowledge with us today and Nikolai and NBIM for hosting us today. And when I was offered the chance to discuss investment philosophy, I said there's no way I'd rather spend my birthday. I'm extremely interested in investment philosophy. I think it has to undergird everything we do. My argument is that our behavior has to be well thought out and intentional, and so our methodology has to be as well.</p>
</details>

它始于一个有意识的决定：你想要实现什么。这听起来可能很简单，“我们想拥有更多的钱，而不是更少；我们想要更高的回报，而不是更低。”但任何投资组织的起始问题应该是：我们是满足于平均水平，还是试图超越平均水平？这听起来像个简单的问题，但你必须认识到，在投资中，达到平均水平极其容易。你可以购买现成的产品，保证你做到平均水平。或者你可以尝试超越平均水平，这极其困难，而且没有万无一失的解决方案。如果你试图超越平均水平，这会让你面临低于平均水平的风险。这两者是不可分割的。所以，深思熟虑地、有意识地、有目的地决定，对你和你的组织来说，是哪一种？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It starts with a conscious decision as to what you want to accomplish. Now this may sound easy. Well, we want to have more money rather than less. We want to have a higher return rather than less. But the starting question for any organization in investing should be, will we settle for average or do we want to try to be above average? Now that sounds like an easy one, but you have to recognize that in investing, it's extremely easy to be average. You can buy off-the-shelf products that will guarantee you that you'll do average. Or you can try to be above average, which is extremely difficult, and there is no surefire solution to how to get there. And if you try to be above average, it exposes you to the risk of being below average. The two are inseparable. So thoughtfully, consciously, intentionally, which is it for you and your organization?</p>
</details>

接下来，我相信一个组织必须有一个信条，一种信仰——它所相信的东西，它所不相信的东西，它会做的事情，以及它因为不信任而不会做的事情。你必须坚持它，而且这必须是有意识和有意的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, I believe that an organization has to have a creed, a religion, the things it believes in, the things it doesn't believe in, the things it will do, the things it won't do because it doesn't trust them. And you have to stick to it. And again, it has to be conscious and intentional.</p>
</details>

我们必须做出决定。我们的意图是什么？我们相信什么？我们会相信宏观预测，还是会避免它？你如何看待风险？你会采取高风险的方法还是低风险的方法？哪条是你的成功之路？这对每个人来说都不一样。你相信**有效市场假说**（Efficient Market Hypothesis: 一种经济学理论，认为资产价格已完全反映所有可得信息）吗？这极其重要。这是我60年代末在芝加哥大学研究生教育中学到的最重要的概念。许多人理解这个概念，但很少有人将其融入并思考在日常生活中。这些是我们必须考虑的一些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have to make decisions. What will be our intention? What do we believe in? Will we trust macro forecasting or will we abstain from it? How do you think about risk? Will you take a high-risk approach or a low-risk approach? Which is your route to success? It's not the same for everybody. Do you believe in the efficient market? This is extremely important. It's the most important concept I took away from my graduate education at the University of Chicago in the late 60s. Many people understand the concept, very few people incorporate it and think about it in their daily lives. These are some of the things that we have to consider.</p>
</details>

有效市场理论认为，有很多人在那里，他们都精通数字、聪明、积极性高、客观且理性。他们都想实现你所做的事情，那就是最终拥有的钱比开始时多。考虑到竞争的范围，你将如何成为实现目标的那个人，而不是他们？这并不容易想清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The theory of market efficiency is that there are a lot of people out there and they're all numerate, intelligent, highly motivated, objective, and rational. And they all want to accomplish the thing you do, which is to end up with more money than you started with. Given the scope of competition, how will you be the one who accomplishes the goal rather than them? Not easily thought out.</p>
</details>

我们所说的有效市场假说的强式形式是，由于这些情况，所有信息都会立即被纳入资产价格，以至于没有任何一个人能弄清楚哪些是便宜货，哪些是定价过高。实际上，真正的强式形式略有不同，它说，由于这个密集的过程，资产价格总是正确的。你无法击败它们，所以你无法击败市场。

<p class="english-text">Now, what we call the strong form of the efficient market hypothesis says that due to these circumstances, all information is immediately incorporated into the price of assets to the extent that no one person can figure out which are the bargains and which are the overpricing. Now, the really strong form is actually a little different. It says that the prices of assets as a result of this intensive process are always right. You can't beat them, and so you can't beat the market.</p>
</details>

我不认为那是对的。我认为价格不一定是对的，它们只是共识所能做到的最好结果，任何一个人都很难持续比共识更聪明。这是两回事。但两者的底线是相同的：你无法击败市场。所以问题是，你接受这一点吗？这会推动你走向被动方法，目标是平均表现、低成本、低风险，极有可能成功实现你的目标，也就是达到平均水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I don't think that's right. I think the prices are not necessarily right, they're just the best that the consensus can do, and it's hard for any one person to be smarter than the consensus consistently. Two different things. But the bottom line on both is the same: you can't beat the market. So the question is, do you accept that? And that pushes you toward a passive approach, targeting average performance, low cost, low risk, highly likely to succeed to accomplish your objective, which is being average.</p>
</details>

或者，面对存在的激烈竞争，你会尝试超越平均水平吗？你会承受成本吗？你追求超越平均水平会让你面临低于平均水平的风险吗？你会参与这种追求卓越表现的活动吗？这并不那么可能成功。我在芝加哥大学学到的第一件事是，平均而言，大多数人在扣除费用前表现平平，扣除费用后则低于平均水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or will you try to be above average in the face of the very strong competition that exists? Will you endure the costs? Will your pursuit of being above average permit you to be exposed to the risk of being below average? And will you engage in this pursuit of superior performance which is not that likely to succeed? You know, the first thing I learned at University of Chicago was that on average, most people do average before fees and below average after fees.</p>
</details>

另一个重要问题是，你会押注于宏观预测吗？每个人都在做宏观预测，但我认为它们没有任何用处。这是一个温和的夸张，但并非那么夸张。事实是，大多数时候，事情会像现在这样继续下去。所以，一个外推的预测在大多数时候是正确的，大多数人也持有这种观点。大多数人期望外推。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, another important question is, will you bet on macro forecasts? Everybody makes macro forecasts, and yet I don't believe that they are of any use. That's a mild exaggeration, but not so great. The truth of the matter is that most of the time, things continue as they are. So a forecast of extrapolation is correct most of the time, and most people share that view. Most people expect extrapolation.</p>
</details>

近期趋势和长期趋势的外推已包含在证券价格中。因此，当外推结果证明是正确时，这并不是一个有利可图的预期，因为其他人也都有这个预期，它已经反映在你支付的价格中了。非常有价值的预测是那些预示着与趋势有根本性偏离、与外推有根本性偏离的预测。当你做出这些预测并且它们是正确的时候，它们非常重要。问题是，它们并不经常正确，因为大多数时候事情都是外推的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Extrapolation of the recent trends, the long-term trends, is incorporated in security prices. So when the extrapolation turns out to be correct, it's not a profitable expectation because everybody else had it as well. It was in the price you paid. The forecasts that are very profitable are the ones that call for radical deviation from trend, radical deviation from extrapolation. These are very significant when you make them and they're right. The trouble is they're not right very often because most of the time things are extrapolated.</p>
</details>

因此，我们有外推的预测，通常是正确的但无利可图；还有偏离趋势的预测，可能非常有利可图但并不经常正确。我认为这种分析意味着宏观预测是行不通的。29年前我们创办橡树资本时，我们坐下来写下了我们一直在做的事情，因为我们有幸已经在一起工作了平均九年。我们有一个非常简单的六点投资哲学，它指导着我们所做的一切。第五点说，我们的行动不受宏观预测驱动。我们是自下而上的投资者，选择个别公司，而不是自上而下地选择市场和国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we have forecasts of extrapolation which are usually correct but not profitable, and forecasts of deviation from trend which are potentially very profitable but not often correct. I take that analysis to mean macro forecasting doesn't work. And when we started Oaktree 29 years ago this month, we sat down and we wrote out the things we had been doing because we had the benefit of having worked together for nine years already on average. And we have a very simple investment philosophy of six points which governs everything we do. And number five says that our actions are not driven by macro forecasts. We are bottom-up investors, selecting individual companies, not top-down selecting markets and countries.</p>
</details>

我们认为我们可以通过研究微观的公司、行业和证券获得知识优势，而不是宏观的国家、市场和利率。我的英雄之一是约翰·肯尼思·加尔布雷思，他说我们有两种预测者：一种是不知道的，另一种是不知道自己不知道的。几十年来我都知道我不知道，所以我认为我们在这方面有优势。

<p class="english-text">So that's a different, we think we can get an advantage. By the way, where does outperforming come from? In short, it comes from having a knowledge advantage, and you have to know something better than most other people to outperform. Just trying is not going to help you if you don't know something they don't know. So we think we can get a knowledge advantage in studying the micro—companies, industries, and securities—not the macro—countries, markets, and rates, for example. So, you know, we bar that from our approach. One of my heroes is John Kenneth Galbraith who said, "We have two kinds of forecasters: the ones who don't know, and the ones who don't know they don't know." And I've known for decades that I don't know, so I think we have an advantage in that.</p>
</details>

我引用美国幽默家和小说家马克·吐温的话，他说：“让你陷入麻烦的不是你不知道的事，而是你确信无疑但实际上是错的事。”没有任何以“我不知道，但是”或“我可能错了，但是”开头的句子会让人陷入麻烦。让你陷入麻烦的是那些说“我确定某某事会发生”的句子。因为如果你坚信某件事，并重仓押注，结果你错了，那就会让你陷入大麻烦。所以，你会押注于宏观预测吗？在我看来，这是一个关键且至高无上的决定。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I quote the American humorist and novelist Mark Twain who said, "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for certain that just ain't true." No sentence that starts with "I don't know, but" or "I could be wrong, but" ever got anybody into trouble. The ones that get you into trouble are the ones that say, "I'm sure that's such and such," because if you believe something strongly and you bet on it heavily and you're wrong, that's how you get into big trouble. So will you bet on macro forecasting? This in my opinion is a critical and overarching decision.</p>

### 专题讨论：多元哲学与公私市场之辩

**Pedro Faria:** 欢迎回来。格雷格、霍华德，今天会议的开场真是太棒了，非常感谢。现在，让-海因斯和帕特里克-希利也加入了我们，我们将进一步深入讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Welcome. It is such a privilege to have the four of you with us today. Greg, Howard, what a way to start this conference today. That was incredible. Thank you so much. We are now joined by Jean and Patrick, and we'll aim to take the discussion further.</p>
</details>

**Pedro Faria:** 让，我从你开始。格雷格和霍华德阐述了他们的投资哲学和对投资信条的需求。你执掌的惠灵顿（Wellington）可以被看作是投资精品店的联合体。不必拥有一个总括性的投资哲学，其优势和陷阱究竟是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Jean, I'll start with you. So Greg and Howard ran through their investment philosophy and the need for an investment creed. You run Wellington, which can be seen as a federation of investment boutiques. What are really the advantages and the pitfalls of not having to have an overarching investment philosophy?</p>
</details>

**Jean Hynes:** 谢谢你，也感谢大家分享你们的见解，那真的非常引人入胜。我坐在那里听的时候在想，我们大约有60个团队。我们并非由一个总括性的哲学和流程组织起来。我想我们总括性的哲学和流程是，我们相信一个哲学和流程对投资团队至关重要。我们大约有60个团队，每个团队都有一个非常强大的哲学和流程，非常类似于格雷格和霍华德所做的。那就是他们每天实践的，也是他们所相信的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jean Hynes:** Thank you. And thank you for sharing all your insights. That was really fascinating. When I was sitting there listening, it made me think, you know, we have about 60 teams. Like you said, we're not organized by one overarching philosophy and process. I guess our overarching philosophy and process is that we believe a philosophy and process is critical to the investment team. We have about 60 teams, and each of those teams have a very strong philosophy and process, very similar to what Greg and Howard do. And that's what they practice every day, and that's what they believe.</p>
</details>

**Jean Hynes:** 在惠灵顿，我们将其结合起来。我认为每家公司都有一个优势。我认为我们的优势在于我们非常协作。在过去的33年里，我们真正打破了壁垒。因此，我们的股票长线投资者与我们的固定收益同事合作，后者又与我们的私募资产同事以及做多空策略的同事合作。这就是秘诀所在。我们没有一个首席投资官，我们有600个首席投资官。我们已经将辩论常态化，对任何话题都有不同的观点。然后，每个团队都可以去实践他们深思熟虑、坚定持有的关于如何为客户赚钱的信念。这就是我们的组织方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jean Hynes:** We combine that at Wellington. Every, I think every company has an edge. I think our edge is that we are really collaborative. So we have over the, you know, I've been at Wellington for 33 years, over those 33 years, we have really broken down silos. And so that our long-only investors on in equity collaborate with our fixed income colleagues who collaborate with our private colleagues who do private assets and who do long-short. That's the secret sauce. Like, how do we, we don't have one CIO, we have 600 CIOs. And we have normalized debate, having different perspectives on any topic. And then each of those teams can go and practice their very well-thought-out, strongly held beliefs about how they're going to make money for clients. That's how we're organized.</p>
</details>

**Pedro Faria:** 帕特里克，我把你拉进对话。你所从事的**私募**（Private Market: 相对于公开交易的股票和债券市场，指非公开交易的股权或债权投资）性质对你的投资过程有任何直接影响吗？私募市场投资和公开市场投资之间有什么本质上的不同吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Very good. Patrick, I'll pull you into the conversation. Does the private nature of what you do have any direct implications on your investment process? Is there anything intrinsically different between private market investing and public market investing?</p>
</details>

**Patrick Healey:** 嗯，我想鉴于我温和的性格，我可能听起来像是私募股权的代言人。但我要说，我认为私募股权是一个有优势的资产类别。如果你想进入投资行业，你从结构开始。我们有5年的投资期，我们可以将资金投资10年，甚至12年。所以我们不必一直都投资，你可以选择时机。这是一个巨大的优势。你可以进行内部尽职调查，这绝对是一个巨大的优势。你可以选择和挑选你的管理团队。你可以借钱，我做这个已经30年了，我记得在我最初的15年里，你实际上是带着契约借钱的，但在过去的15年里，我们借钱是没有契约的，这真是非同寻常。你可以选择何时出售一家企业，你可以在董事会中达成一致。投资者和管理团队可以选定三到四件真正想去做的事情。我认为这是一个巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Patrick Healey:** Well, I suppose given my demure nature, I might sound like the poster child for private equity. But I'll say, look, I think private equity is an advantaged asset class if you're going to be in the investment business. And you sort of start with just the structure. You know, we have a 5-year investment period, we can have the money invested for 10, maybe 12 years. So we don't have to be invested all the time. You can pick your spots. That's a huge advantage. You get to do inside diligence. That's an absolutely huge advantage. You get to choose and select your management teams. You get to borrow money, and I've been doing this for 30 years, and I can remember over my first 15 years, you actually borrowed money with covenants. But for the last 15 years, we get lent money without covenants. So that's sort of extraordinary. You get to choose when you want to sell a business, and you get to have alignment, you know, in the boardroom. It's sort of the investor and the management team. You get to choose three to four things that you really want to go for. I think that's a huge advantage.</p>
</details>

**Pedro Faria:** 格雷格，霍华德，投资期限如何融入你们的投资哲学？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Greg, Howard, how does investment horizon fit into your investment philosophy?</p>
</details>

**Howard Marks:** 就像帕特里克说的，我们大约一半的资产是封闭式基金，你有钱一段时间。最大的优势是客户不能撤资。所以，你知道，失控的人喜欢在兴奋时买入，在沮丧时卖出。我们的这种方法阻止了他们这样做。这是投资行业中可以拥有的最大优势之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Howard Marks:** Like Patrick says, maybe half of our assets are closed-end funds where you have the money for a period of time. And the great advantage is that the clients can't withdraw. So, you know, people out of control of their situation love to buy when they're excited and sell when they're depressed. And our this approach keeps them from doing so. That's one of the greatest advantages one can have in the investment business.</p>
</details>

**Greg Jensen:** 我认为主要的事情是，从长远来看，你必须知道你的优势是什么。这对我们来说，我们真正理解并关注的时间框架是6到18个月。对一些人来说，这很长；对另一些人来说，这很短。但6到18个月是我们认真思考过的。尽管霍华德对宏观投资有自己的看法，但我们相信我们对世界上正在发生的事情有理解上的优势。我们确实经常犯错，所以你必须知道如何为犯错做准备。在宏观领域，有很多宏观事件在发生，所以你可以在你谈论的许多不同事物之间进行多元化配置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Greg Jensen:** Well, I think the main thing is in the long term, you have to know what your advantage is. And that's the big thing. So for us, our time frame that we really understand well and we focus on is 6 to 18 months. So for some, that's very long term, for some, that's very short term. But 6 to 18 months is what we've thought really hard about. And believe, despite Howard's thoughts on macro investing, that we have an edge in understanding what's happened in the world. Now, we are wrong a lot to his point, and so you have to know how to be prepared for being wrong. And within macro, there's a lot of macro things going on, so you can diversify across many different things that you're talking about.</p>
</details>

**Pedro Faria:** 霍华德，你谈到了市场效率。现在市场上有无穷无尽的信息和大量的噪音，但可以说市场随着时间的推移变得更加有效。与10年或20年前相比，你如何看待你的投资策略的阿尔法生成机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Howard, you touched on market efficiency. There's now endless information and a lot of noise in the market, but markets have arguably become more efficient over time. So a question to both of you, how do you compare the alpha generation opportunity of your investment strategies now compared to say 10, 20 years ago?</p>
</details>

**Howard Marks:** 我认为随着时间的推移，这变得越来越难了。你知道，沃伦·巴菲特谈到60年前用50美分买一美元。你可以在50、40年前做到这一点。我自己也买过一些我认为不可能存在的东西，但你确实能找到几乎不会失手的便宜货。今天这非常难。如果你想一想，今天每个人都知道一切。今天不存在不知道某件事的情况，如果它是事实的话。所以随着时间的推移，知识是累积的，市场变得更有效，击败市场变得更难。但我仍然相信有些人可以表现出色。他们的优势幅度可能会缩小，他们的工作日可能会变长，但我仍然认为这是可能的，但每天都变得更难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Howard Marks:** I think it's gotten a lot harder over time. You know, Warren Buffett talked about having bought dollars for 50 cents 60 years ago. You could do that 50, 40 years ago. I myself bought things that I thought, this can't exist, and yet you got bargains virtually that couldn't miss. It's very hard today. If you think about it, everybody knows everything today. There's no such thing today as not knowing something if it's fact. And so over time, knowledge is cumulative, markets become more efficient, it has become harder to beat markets. Still, I believe some people can be superior. Their margin of superiority may shrink, their work day may get longer, but I still think it's possible, but it becomes harder every day.</p>
</details>

**Greg Jensen:** 我认为这有点不同。我认为这就像印第500赛车，赛车每年都在进步，所以你每年也必须进步，但总会有一个赢家。如果你不进步，那么任何优势都会渗透到普遍的理解中。但如果你继续进步，这就像印第500赛车一样。至少，我相信我们的阿尔法产生的核心因素并没有太大变化。我不认为我们作为一个物种在爱、恐惧和贪婪等方面有任何进步。我们或多或少地在重复同样的事情。所以我同意在计算和套利方面，现在做起来容易得多，这些机会不再存在。但人们会犯非常愚蠢的错误，如果你有办法理解并利用这一点，这种情况会继续存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Greg Jensen:** I look at it a little differently. I think it's like the Indy 500, or whatever. The cars get better every year, so you have to get better every year, but there's still a winner. If you don't get better, then any advantage will seep into general understanding. But if you continue to get better, it is like the Indy 500. And the core, at least the core things that I believe our alpha is generated from, really aren't changing much. I don't think we're getting any better as a species on things like love and fear and greed. Like we keep doing the same things more or less over and over again. So I agree on things like calculating and arbitrage, that is like much easier to do, it's generally well known, those things are not there anymore. But the fact that people are going to make, we all will make really dumb mistakes, and if you have ways of understanding that and doing that, that continues.</p>
</details>

**Pedro Faria:** 让，你们如何将从错误中学习制度化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Pedro Faria:** Jean, how do you institutionalize learning from mistakes in your organization?</p>
</details>

**Jean Hynes:** 我们做很多事情。我们每天都有一个每日会议，在伦敦办公室、亚洲和伦敦之间，以及波士顿和我们的美国办公室与伦敦之间。每天我们都会谈论各种事情，包括有时如果市场发生什么事，我们会讨论“你从上次市场那样时学到了什么？你学到了什么错误？”我们已经将不当明星、不总是正确的行为常态化，因为我们知道，作为投资者，你经常会错。我们还做一些叫做“经验教训”的事情。我们会请一个投资了25年或30年的人，我们请他们变得脆弱，比如“真正的原因是什么？你投资生涯中的关键时刻是什么？”这些都会被录下来，人们会观看并从中学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Jean Hynes:** So we do a number of things. We have a daily meeting every day, and in that daily meeting, which happens in our London office between Asia and London, and between Boston and our US offices and London, every day we talk about all kinds of things. And including sometimes we talk about if something's happening in the market, you know, what did you learn from the last time the market was like then? What mistakes did you learn? We have normalized sort of not being a star and not being right all the time, which is, as we know, being an investor, you're wrong quite often. We also do these things called Lessons Learned. So we would have someone who's been investing for 25 years or 30 years, and we ask them to be vulnerable, like what really was the reason and the seminal moments in your investing career? And those are all recorded, and people watch them and learn from them.</p>
</details>

**Greg Jensen:** 这对我们的哲学至关重要。要明确的是，这非常困难，因为你最不想做的事就是惩罚错误，你必须帮助人们学习。所以我们一直在努力寻找正确的制度化方法。对我来说，拥有一个真正的问题日志非常有价值。对我们来说，人们很容易输入问题。当你思考哪些问题重要时，每个人都有问题，但对我们重要的问题是那些阻止你实现目标的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Greg Jensen:** It's so critical to our philosophy. And we, to be clear, it's very hard because the last thing you want to do is punish mistakes. You have to help people learn. And so we've struggled with the right institutionalization. Having a real issue log is so valuable. And for us, it's very easy for people to enter issues. And again, when you think through what are the issues that matter, everybody's got issues, but the issues that matter to us are the things that are preventing you from achieving your goals.</p>
</details>

**Greg Jensen:** 谈论问题很容易，但你真的会因此改变什么吗？通常正确的答案是“我什么都不改变”，因为错误是正常的一部分。但积极决定我们是否要改变某件事，或者我们不改变某件事，这非常重要。最重要的是，最高级的领导者，CEO、CIO，他们是那些被记录问题的人，因为他们做出了最大、最重要的决定。所以确保问责的箭头向上而不是向下，这是一个巨大的教训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Greg Jensen:** It's easy to talk about problems, but are you actually changing anything? And oftentimes, the right answer is I'm not changing anything, like that mistakes are a normal part of it. But knowing whether actively deciding are we going to change something or are we not going to change something is super important. Mostly, most important is that the most senior leaders, the CEO, the CIO, they're the ones getting issue logged, and they're the ones staring because they make the biggest, most important decisions. So making sure the arrow of accountability goes up, not down, was a huge lesson in our organization.</p>

### 罗伯特·华莱士：成功投资的三大支柱

如果你想成为一个成功的长期投资者，你需要做对三件事：策略、执行和治理。我称之为投资成功的三大支柱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing that you need to do right if you want to be a successful long-term investor, and that's strategy. And here's a quote from the great Norwegian polar explorer Amundsen: "Victory awaits him who has everything in order. People call it luck." What a nice succinct way to talk about strategy. You have a goal, you need to build a plan, a strategy to achieve your goal. The next key pillar that we have to get right is execution. And this is one of my favorite quotes from the American inventor Thomas Edison: "Opportunity is missed by most people because it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work." So the final pillar of investment success is governance. And this one is talked about less, but it's just as important. Here's a great quote from another incredibly impressive Norwegian polar explorer, Nansen: "The difficult is what takes a little time, the impossible is what takes a little longer." And this is a great quote about governance.</p>
</details>

对于斯坦福捐赠基金，我们有两个关键目标。第一，我们希望成为当前一代学生和学者学术生活的重要组成部分。第二个目标是，我们希望对所有未来世代的学生和学者至少具有同样的影响力和支持力。这引入了一个我们称之为“保持购买力”的概念。这意味着，如果你每年从捐赠基金中支出5%，你至少要赚回那5%，但你还必须赚足足以抵消通货膨胀影响的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have two key goals for the Stanford endowment. One, we want to be able to be a material part of the academic life of the current generation of students and scholars at Stanford. Goal number two is we want to be as at least as impactful and supportive for all future generations of students and scholars at Stanford. So that introduces a concept that we call the preservation of purchasing power. So that just means that if you're spending 5% every year from your endowment, you have to earn back at least that 5%, but you'll also have to earn enough to offset the impacts of inflation.</p>
</details>

我们实现这一目标的方式是在投资组合中偏向股权。股权的预期回报高于固定收益或现金，从长远来看，如果你想实现第二个目标，这一点非常重要。不幸的是，我们都知道，股权风险很高。为了应对额外的风险，我们进行多元化投资。我们寻找哈里·马科维茨所说的“免费午餐”。我们持有不同类型的股权，我们持有一些在美国，一些在欧洲，一些在亚洲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The way that we do that is we have an equity bias in the portfolio. Equities have a higher expected return than fixed income or cash, and that's really important in the long run if you want to achieve that second goal. Unfortunately, as we all know, equities are very risky. How do we deal with that extra risk? We diversify. We look for something that Nobel laureate Harry Markowitz called the free lunch. So we own different types of equities. We own some equities in the United States, some equities in Europe, some equities in Asia.</p>
</details>

执行力有几个部分。首先是投资组合管理。每天我们都会得到一个投资组合的快速估算。我们可能会开始采取两种行动之一。第一种是我们可能会在资产类别之间重新平衡投资组合。第二种我们进行的投资组合管理是在资产类别内部轮换资本。斯坦福捐赠基金的证券层面决策是由我们寻找、识别并试图建立长期关系的外部合作伙伴做出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Execution has a couple parts. The first is portfolio management. So every day we get a flash estimate of where the portfolio is. We may start to make one of two types of actions. The first is we may rebalance the portfolio between asset classes. The second type of portfolio management that we conduct is rotating capital inside of asset classes. The security level decisions for the Stanford endowment are made by external partners that we find, we identify, we try to build long-term relationships.</p>
</details>

良好的治理支持对正确策略的纪律性执行，这一点在市场极端时期尤为重要。你可以想象一个极端狂热的时期，某个热门行业或资产类别表现远超其他一切，根据定义，你的多元化投资组合将表现不及那个热门行业。糟糕的治理会说，去追逐那个行业。另一种极端是恐惧和恐慌。想象一下2008年秋天，每个人都在抛售所有风险资产，试图筹集现金。在那种环境下，如果你是一个机构投资者，正确的做法是购买人们正在抛售的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Good governance supports the disciplined execution of the right strategy, and this is really critically important, particularly in times of market extremes. So you can think of a time of extreme euphoria where there's some hot sector, some hot asset class of the day that's dramatically outperforming everything else. And by definition, your diversified portfolio will underperform that hot sector. And bad governance would say, chase that sector. The other type of extreme is fear and panic. So think of the fall of 2008 when everybody was selling every risky asset and trying to raise cash. The right thing to do in that environment if you were an institutional investor was to buy the things that people were selling.</p>

### 马克·罗温：拥抱变革，重新思考投资范式

我告诉我的组织，不要防守，要好奇。变革是永恒的。作为投资者，在金融服务领域，我认为我们一直低估了变革的影响。我们抗拒变革，我们否认变革，我们固守现状。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I tell my organization, don't be defensive, be curious. Change is a constant. We as investors, we in financial services, I think have consistently underestimated the impact of change. We've been resistant to change, we've denied change, we stick to the status quo.</p>
</details>

回顾过去40年，我认为我们生活在一个顺风的时代。我的职业生涯很幸运，我认为你们大多数人也很幸运。我们有四个顺风：利率从高到低；我们印了大量的钱；我们通过财政借贷，几乎在世界各地都预支了未来的需求；我们还享受了全球化的好处。这四件事中，有哪一件在未来还会成立吗？我不知道。我认为存在一场健康的辩论，关于它们是否会成为逆风。但我认为我们正处于没有顺风的时期。

We've had four tailwinds: rates have gone from high to low, we have printed an awful lot of money, we have borrowed forward future demand through fiscal borrowing almost everywhere in the world, and we've had the benefit of globalization. Are any of those four things true going forward? I don't know. I think there's a healthy debate as to whether they are headwinds, but I would argue I think we're in the absence of tailwinds.</p>

我们为什么会认为过去40年行之有效的投资策略在未来还会奏效？过去10年的业绩记录真的有任何价值吗？还是我们应该完全抛弃它？我们都作为投资者，从回顾过去五年、过去十年中获得极大的安慰。美国再印8万亿美元，然后一切都向右上角上涨的可能性有多大？为什么业绩记录还会有意义？

<p class="english-text">Why would we think the investment strategies that work for the past 40 years would work going forward? Is there actually any value to track record over the last 10 years, or should we just completely throw it away? We all as investors take great comfort of looking at the last five years, the last 10 years. What are the chances that we're going to print in the US another 8 trillion dollar and everything will go up to the right? Why would track record be relevant?</p>

我认为我至少有40%的时间是错的，这在棒球术语中会使我成为有史以来最高效的球员。好吧，让我们创造一种接受你可能失败并能迅速纠正错误的组织文化。让我们不要因为人们做出错误的决定而解雇他们，让我们因为他们不做决定而解雇他们。

公开市场有流动性吗？我不这么认为。也许在股票方面是这样，但在固定收益方面不是。2008年对固定收益领域的做市资本施加了极端的惩罚。如今的做市资本仅为2008年的10%，而市场规模是当时的三倍。是的，我们生活在流动性只有三十分之一的环境中。现在卖出一支投资级公司债券需要5天时间，这还不包括前20大发行人。

<p class="english-text">Are public markets liquid? I don't think so. Maybe on the equity side that's true. On the fixed income side, no. 2008 put an extreme penalty on market making capital in fixed income in particular. Market making capital is 10% of what it was today of what it was in 2008. Markets are three times their size. Yes, we are living with a 30th of the liquidity. It now takes 5 days to sell an investment grade corporate bond outside the top 20.</p>

我们为什么要公开上市？公开和私募之间到底有什么区别？我不清楚它们之间有任何流动性差异，股票除外。第二个巨大的根本性变化是，2008年以来，世界各地的大部分监管，不仅是当时，而且持续至今，都在削弱银行在经济中的作用。世界各地都在以不同的速度经历去银行化。

It's not clear to me that there's any liquidity difference, equities aside.

我们正在重新思考银行的角色、投资者的角色，这是一个巨大的变化。作为投资者，我们将在固定收益领域经历前所未见的产品。过去40年被锁定在金融机构资产负债表上的风险回报、产品和收益，正作为投资产品向你们走来。我们都将不得不克服我们对公开和私募的偏见。

We're all going to have to overcome biases that we have about public and private.</p>

### 安妮·杜克：知道何时退出——投资中的止损艺术

不确定性让我们很难开始做某件事，因为有两种形式的不确定性在对我们做的任何决定施加影响。第一种就是纯粹的运气。这意味着我们可以做出一个很好的决定，一个在90%的情况下都会成功的决定，但有10%的情况下它不会成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uncertainty makes it very hard to start things, and that's because there's two forms of uncertainty that are exerting themselves on any decision that we make. The first is just plain luck, which means that we can make a great decision, we can make a decision that's going to work out 90% of the time, but 10% of the time it's not going to work out.</p>
</details>

好消息是，对于我们决定做的大多数事情，我们都有稍后退出的选项。退出可能会有不同的成本，但几乎我们决定开始的任何事情，我们实际上都可以退出。这意味着，让我们很难开始做事情的不确定性，因为有了稍后退出的选项，开始就变得更容易了。因为我们可以预见到，当我们观察到世界没有朝着我们的方向发展时，或者当我们观察到我们正在学习新事物，这些信号告诉我们我们的选择其实并不那么好时，我们有能力退出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The good news for us is that for most things that we decide to do, we have the option to quit later. That quit might have varying costs associated with it, but almost anything that we decide to start, we can actually quit. And what that means is that the uncertainty that makes it really hard for us to start things, this option to quit later makes that start easier because we can anticipate the ability to exit when we observe that the world isn't going in our direction, or when we observe that we're getting signals that we're learning new things that tell us that our choice wasn't actually that good.</p>
</details>

但这里有一个非常大的问题：尽管我们有这个极其宝贵的选项——我甚至认为这是我们在决策中拥有的最宝贵的选项，即离开的选项——但问题是我们实际上非常不擅长退出。我们倾向于在事情上拖延太久，远晚于如果你仅仅根据预期价值判断的正确退出时机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here's the really big problem: is that even though we have this incredibly valuable option, and I would actually argue that it's the single most valuable option that we have in decision-making is this option to walk away, the problem is that we actually are quite bad at quitting. We tend to walk away from things much too late compared to when, if you were just judging expected value, would be the correct time to actually walk away.</p>
</details>

我们有一种强烈的直觉，当我们从世界得到信息，事情进展得不那么顺利时，我们会注意并离开。但这种直觉实际上是错误的。相反，面对这些负面信号，我们会升级我们的承诺。这是一种众所周知的效应，叫做**承诺升级**（Escalation of Commitment: 一种决策行为，指个人或团体在面对负面结果时，继续坚持原有决策并投入更多资源），即我们得到这些信号，非但没有减少我们对事业的承诺，反而升级了我们对事业的承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have this very strong intuition that when we get information from the world that things aren't going that well, we'll actually pay attention and walk away. But that intuition is actually wrong. Instead, in the face of those negative signals, we escalate our commitment. This is a well-known effect, it's called escalation of commitment, that we get these signals and instead of actually reducing our commitment to the cause, having gotten those adverse signals, we actually escalate our commitment to the cause.</p>

### 迈克尔·莫布森：克服认知偏误，做出更优决策

我认为阻碍做出好决策的第一个非常大的障碍是过度自信的概念。事实证明，通常被认为是所有问题根源的过度自信，有不同的种类。我们最感兴趣的是过度精确这个概念。我们实际上认为我们对未来的理解比我们实际上的要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the first very big barrier to making good decisions is the notion of overconfidence. Now it turns out overconfidence, which is often considered the root of all problems, comes again in different varieties. The one that we're most interested in, I think, is this concept of overprecision. We actually think we understand the future better than we actually do.</p>
</details>

我们做了一个有50个判断题的练习，现在大约有2万人做过。平均信心是70%，平均正确率是60%左右。人们在自己的判断上过度自信了10个百分点。当人们100%确定自己知道答案时，他们只有77%的时间是正确的。当他们90%确定时，他们只有三分之二的时间是正确的。尤其是在“我非常确定”这个范围内，存在着巨大的差距。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've had now about 20,000 people do this exercise, and this is the scatter plot of all the responses. The average confidence is 70% and the average correct is about 60%. People are 10 percentage points overconfident in their own judgments. When people are 100% sure they know the answer, they're only right 77% of the time. When they are 90% sure, they're only right two-thirds of the time. There's this yawning gap, especially in this range of "I am very sure what's going on."</p>

我们如何改进？丹尼·卡尼曼推广的一个概念是内部视角与外部视角的对比。内部视角是，当你面对一个问题时，你收集大量信息，结合自己的经验，然后投射到未来。外部视角则相反，它说，我要把我的问题看作一个更大参照类别中的一个实例。我要问，当其他人以前处于这种情况时发生了什么？心理学家如卡尼曼已经证明，内部视角和外部视角的某种结合，能带来更好的预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How can we improve? One of the concepts that Danny Kahneman popularized is this idea of the inside versus the outside view. The inside view says when I give you a problem, you gather lots of information, you combine it with your own experience, and then you project into the future. The outside view, by contrast, says I'm going to think about my problem as an instance of a larger reference class. I'm going to ask what happened when other people were in this situation before. What psychologists like Kahneman have demonstrated is some combination of the inside and the outside view lead to better forecasts.</p>
</details>

第二个主要问题是**确认偏误**（Confirmation Bias: 人们倾向于寻找、解释和回忆那些证实自己已有信念或假设的信息的趋势）。确认偏误是，即使你做出决定时很挣扎，一旦你做出了决定，你就会寻找确认你观点的信息，并打折、忽视或否认不支持你观点的信息。有趣的是，几乎所有其他的偏误，在某种程度上都会被智力所缓解，但确认偏误不是。它影响每一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second major problem, this is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias, as you all know, even if you struggle to make a decision, once you've made a decision, you seek information that confirms your point of view and you discount, dismiss, or disavow information that does not support your point of view. Now there's a very interesting point about confirmation bias. It turns out almost all the biases that are out there are mitigated to some degree by intelligence. The one that that's not true for is confirmation bias. This affects everybody, no matter who they are and how bright they are.</p>
</details>

2005年，我第一次有机会见到丹尼·卡尼曼。在会议结束时，我问他：“丹尼，如果一个投资者能做一件事来改善他或她的结果，那会是什么？”他毫不犹豫地说：“你必须为你的决定写日记。”写下你认为会发生什么，为什么你认为会发生。最重要的是，在表达你与市场不同的观点时，要用概率而不是词语来沟通。因为如果你用词语，它们会足够模糊，以至于你事后可以加以修饰。但如果是概率，它能让你记分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2005 was the first chance I ever had to meet Danny Kahneman. At the very end of it, I said, "Danny, if there's one thing an investor can do to improve his or her results, what would it be?" Without hesitation, he said, "You must keep a journal of your decisions." Write down what you think is going to happen, why you think it's going to happen. The most important thing is as you're expressing your variant perception, as you're expressing your view that's different than what's in the market, communicate using probabilities, not words. Because if you use words, they're going to be vague enough that you can massage them after the fact. But if it's a probability, it allows you to keep score.</p>

### 马克·安德森：人工智能、技术颠覆与地缘政治竞赛

在我们的业务中，理论相对直接，即我们通过技术颠覆来赚钱。我们赚钱是因为这些新的初创公司形成，它们要么试图颠覆一个大的现有企业，要么试图创造某种新市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In our business, the theory is relatively straightforward, which is we make money on technological disruption. And so we make money when these new upstart startups form and either try to go take down a big incumbent or try to create some kind of new market.</p>
</details>

理论和希望是，人工智能，特别是围绕人工智能的新突破，如生成式人工智能，代表了一个新的平台。在科技行业，这是一个非常强大的概念，因为新平台的想法是，它是一种新的基础技术，你可以想象在其上重塑成千上万的应用类别。我们当然相信人工智能是一个新的平台转变，我们认为这可能是与微处理器相提并论的重大平台转变之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The theory and the hope is that AI, and specifically these new breakthroughs around AI like generative AI, represent a new platform. And in the tech industry, that's a sort of very powerful concept because the idea of a new platform in the tech industry is sort of a new foundational technology that you can then imagine reinventing thousands and thousands of application categories on top of. We certainly believe that AI is a new platform shift. We believe that AI is one of the really big platform shifts. We think this, you know, might, the possibility exists that this is on par with the microprocessor.</p>

关于人工智能，有两场政策辩论正在进行。一场是，人工智能有点奇怪和可怕，我们应该监管它，以不同的方式阻止它发生。另一场完全不同的对话是地缘政治对话，即与中国的地缘政治竞争。当然，一旦你进入那场对话，就很清楚我们需要赢。我们需要赢得与中国的人工智能竞赛，这与我们赢得与苏联的技术竞赛非常类似。

<p class="english-text">There's sort of two policy debates happening around AI. One policy debate which is, you know, AI is sort of weird and scary and we should regulate it and we should kind of prevent it from happening in different ways. There's a completely different conversation which is the geopolitical conversation, and that's the conversation of basically geopolitical competition with China. And of course, you know, the minute you get into that conversation, it becomes very clear that we need to win. We need to win the AI race with China, you know, sort of a very analogous way that we won the technology race with the Soviet Union.</p>
</details>

西方拥有一个去中心化系统、市场经济以及政府不控制一切的系统的所有优点和缺点。其巨大的优势是创新和企业家精神。缺点是我们的系统很难规划。中国人则拥有一个中心化系统的所有优点和缺点，就像苏联一样。他们有一个指挥和控制系统，共产党拥有和控制一切。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The West has, I would say, all of the advantages and disadvantages of a decentralized system and a market economy and a sort of a system in which governments don't control everything. The huge advantage of that is innovation and entrepreneurship. The disadvantage of that is, you know, very, it's very difficult for our systems to plan. The Chinese have both the advantages and the disadvantages of a centralized system, much like the Soviet Union did. They have a command and control system where the Communist Party owns and controls everything.</p>

在过去的50年里，我认为美国社会和欧盟社会都对技术进步的理念失去了信心，坦率地说，也对经济进步的理念失去了信心，并决定变得更加谨慎、更加规避风险，更不愿意将变革视为积极和令人兴奋的事情。

### 会议总结

非常感谢大家，感谢所有让这次会议成为可能的人。我们幕后有很多人在工作。明年的会议将与今年大不相同。法拉利的首席执行官非常热衷于来奥斯陆烹饪，他对他的驯鹿肉非常感兴趣。我们有一个初步的阵容，除了法拉利，我们还有诺和诺德（Novo Nordisk）的首席执行官，该公司现在是欧洲最大的公司。我们还有DoorDash，这是中国以外最大的外卖公司。我们还有奥的斯（Otis），我认为它在某种程度上体现了经常性收入流的重要性。我们还有雀巢（Nestle），谈论定价能力的重要性以及如何建立品牌。我们还有阿迪达斯（Adidas）的Bjørn Gulden来谈论品牌。最后，埃隆·马斯克也表示他会来，但这还不是一个超级最终的计划。

<p class="english-text">A big thank you to everybody who's made this conference possible. We've had a lot of people working behind the scenes. And then next year conference is going to be something very different from this year. You may remember that we had the CEO of Ferrari on the podcast a little while back. Now he was very keen to come to Oslo to cook. He's very keen on his reindeer. A lot of people want to join the CEO of Ferrari when he comes to Oslo. So we have a preliminary lineup here. In addition to Ferrari, we have the CEO of Novo Nordisk, which is now the largest company in Europe. We have DoorDash, which is the biggest delivery company outside of China. We have Otis, which I think in a way is exemplifying the importance of recurring revenue streams. We have Nestle in terms of pricing power, talking about the importance and how you build brands and how you do that. We have Adidas, Bjørn Gulden, coming to talk about brands. And then lastly, I mean, we, Elon Musk has also said that he's coming, but this is not a super final program yet.</p>
