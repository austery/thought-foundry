### 卢浮宫：从法国象征到犯罪现场

我是《纽约时报》的娜塔莉·基特鲁夫，这里是《The Daily》。世界上最大的博物馆，法国的象征，如今却成为了犯罪现场。

<p class="english-text">Over the weekend, a group of thieves staged a remarkable heist at one of the world's most famous museums.</p>

巴黎警方表示，这些蒙面窃贼使用**升降车**（Basket Lift/Cherry Picker: 一种带有可升降工作平台的车辆）和切割工具闯入了一个画廊。

这就像电影里的场景。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's like a scene from a film.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的，你简直无法编造出这样的故事。我以为这是个玩笑，觉得不可能发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You could not make it up. I thought it was a joke, like no, not possible.</p>
</details>

随着卢浮宫大胆盗窃案的新细节浮出水面，法国的反应是震惊、难以置信和着迷的混合。

<details>

<p class="english-text">As new details emerge about the brazen theft at the Louvre, the response in France has been a mix of shock, disbelief, and fascination.</p>

今天是10月22日，星期三。

<p class="english-text">It's Wednesday, October 22nd.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 凯瑟琳，你好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Catherine, hi.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 你好吗？这可能是我唯一一次录音时，真的像在说：“我需要我们现在就开始，这样我就可以问我的问题了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How are you? This is probably the only taping where I've literally been like, I need us to begin so I can ask my questions right now.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这不完全是真的，这不是唯一一次，但这是一个非常特别的节目，我需要和你谈谈这个故事。我已经读了所有关于这次盗窃案的报道，但我仍然不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that's not true. It's not the only one, but this is a very special episode and I need to talk to you about this story. I have read everything about this heist and I'm not satisfied still.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 我已经准备好听你说了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am I am ready for you.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 好的，很好。首先，请告诉我一群珠宝窃贼是如何闯入卢浮宫并偷走这些非常珍贵的物品的。就从头开始，告诉我到底发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, good. Just to start, tell me exactly how a group of jewel thieves broke into the Louve and stole these very precious items. Just start from the beginning. Tell me exactly what happened. As far as we know,</p>
</details>

### 盗窃案的惊人过程

Natalie: 据我们所知，这起事件始于上周日早上9:30。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as far as we know, this started at 9:30 last Sunday morning.</p>
</details>

那是一个典型的宁静巴黎早晨。我们知道的是，一辆载有梯子的卡车和两辆摩托车驶向卢浮宫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Typical kind of quiet Paris morning. And what we know is this truck that had a ladder attached to it rolls up to the Louv with two motorcycles.</p>
</details>

你可能会好奇为什么会有一辆带梯子的卡车，但在巴黎这很常见，因为公寓走廊很狭窄，人们就是这样搬运家具的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you might wonder why is there a truck with a ladder on it, but in Paris it's pretty common sight cuz this is how you move your furniture in and out of your apartments because of how skinny the halls are. M.</p>
</details>

所以，嗯，它驶过来，停在人行道上紧靠着大楼，两个人跳出来，他们在卡车周围设置了交通锥筒，并穿着像公共事业工人那样的荧光背心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, it rolls up, parks right up against the building on the sidewalk and two people pop out and they set out traffic pylons around the truck and they have fluorescent vests on like public workers do.</p>
</details>

所以，任何从外面看的人都可能认为这是一个完全正常的场景。没什么特别的。除了那两个戴着面具的人，他们随后爬上了电动梯子，到达了二楼的阳台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, like anybody looking at this from the outside might think this is a completely normal scene. Nothing to see here. Nothing necessarily to see except for the two men that then went up this electric ladder to the balcony on the second floor were masked.</p>
</details>

如果你当时在那里，这可能会让你有所警觉。但老实说，这是卢浮宫安静的一侧，靠近塞纳河，人流量不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that might have tipped you off if you were there. But to be honest, this is the quiet side of the Louv. It's near the Sen. Not a lot of foot traffic. So they go up the uh mechanical elevator in a kind of bucket, like a cherry picker.</p>
</details>

他们乘坐像**樱桃采摘车**（Cherry Picker: 一种带有可伸缩臂和工作平台的设备，常用于高空作业）一样的机械升降车到达二楼的阳台，然后他们使用了**角磨机**（Angle Grinder: 一种电动手持工具，用于切割和研磨）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They get to this balcony onto the second floor of the Louve and they use what are known as angle grinders,</p>
</details>

Catherine: 那到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is what exactly?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 有点像电动手锯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kind of like a electric hand saw.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 用它锯开了通往**阿波罗画廊**（Apollo Gallery: 卢浮宫内收藏法国皇室珠宝的著名展厅）的窗户。这是一个金碧辉煌、漫长而美丽的卢浮宫侧翼，由**路易十四**（Louis XIV: 法国波旁王朝国王，在位期间法国国力达到巅峰）建造，作为他凡尔赛宫镜厅的蓝本，里面收藏着法国的皇室珠宝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To saw through the window that leads into what's known as the Apollo gallery. It's this golden long beautiful uh wing of the Louve that literally was built by Louis the 14th as a model for his hall of mirrors and it houses the royal jewels of France.</p>
</details>

这是卢浮宫非常受欢迎的一部分吗？听起来它非常具有标志性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is this like a very popular part of the Lou? It certainly sounds as though it's iconic.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 超级标志性。它显然不如《蒙娜丽莎》那么受欢迎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">super iconic. It's not as popular obviously as the Mona Lisa,</p>
</details>

但它非常接近。你知道，当你进去的时候，通常会很拥挤。它真的很奢华，天花板和墙壁上都有像**德拉克洛瓦**（Delacroix: 法国浪漫主义画家）这样的著名画家的画作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's pretty close. You know, when you go in there, it's often quite crowded. It's really opulent. There's paintings on the ceilings, on the walls by famous people like Deloqua. There are hanging tapestries. There are um sculptures and these cases down the middle that hold the crown jewels. the the thieves break in using this saw.</p>
</details>

有悬挂的挂毯，有雕塑，还有中间放置皇冠珠宝的展柜。窃贼用锯子闯入。我们从卢浮宫的工作人员那里听说，玻璃爆裂了，里面的一些保安人员迅速疏散了房间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We hear from people who work in the Louve that there was an explosion of glass and there were a number of security guards inside who really quickly evacuated the room.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 所以，他们没有接近窃贼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, they didn't approach the thieves.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 不。卢浮宫和大多数博物馆的规程是，如果你遇到携带看似武器的入侵者，你的首要任务是保护人员。所以他们做了他们被指示做的事情，他们受过训练做的事情。他们非常非常迅速地疏散了人群。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. The protocol in the Louvre and most museums is if you are confronted with an intruder that had things that seem like they could be weapons, your priority is protect people. So they did what they were instructed to do, what they've been trained to do. They got people out and very, very quickly.</p>
</details>

当时有多少人在那里？我的意思是，周日上午9:30似乎不是抢劫世界上最著名博物馆的理想时间。当时很拥挤吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how many people were there at the time? I mean, 9:30 a.m. on a Sunday does not seem like the ideal time to rob the most famous museum in the world. Was it crowded?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 嗯，我们不知道那个房间里有多少人。这是尚未浮出水面或调查人员尚未披露的细节之一。我们确实知道卢浮宫是世界上游客最多的博物馆。每天有多达3万人参观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we don't know how many people were in that room. That's like one of the details that has not surfaced yet or been disclosed by investigators. We do know that the Louv is like the most visited museum in the world. Up to 30,000 people visit every day.</p>
</details>

我们看过视频，也和一些当时非常慌乱、不知道为什么被疏散的人交谈过。许多人跑着出去。我的意思是，一开始人们非常害怕，要么是火灾，要么是恐怖袭击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've seen videos and spoken to people who were quite frantic not knowing why they were being evacuated. Many were running to get out. I mean, there was huge fear at first that either there was a fire or this was a terrorist attack.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 所以，窃贼在里面。接下来发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the thieves are inside. What happens next?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 我们知道他们直接走向中间的两排展柜，然后用电锯将它们锯开并打破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we know is that they go like directly to two cases that are in the middle of the line of cases and they use their power saws to cut into them and break them open.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 我听说有一些视频片段拍到了窃贼偷窃这些物品。我们对他们的行为、他们当时在做什么、他们的整体举止有什么了解吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had heard there was some video footage taken of the thieves stealing the pieces. Do we know anything about how they were acting, what they were doing, their general demeanor at the time?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的，我们看过那些视频。它们被提供给了一家法国当地电视台。视频相当模糊，但你可以清楚地看到其中一个男人头上戴着某种黑色头罩。他穿着黄色背心，看起来非常平静，没有一丝慌乱。他只是不停地锯着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we've seen those videos. They were given, I guess, to a local French TV station. They're quite blurry, but you see clearly one of the two men wearing something over his head, like a black covering on his head. He's got his yellow vest on, and he's just he looks incredibly calm, like there's no franticness. He's just sawing away.</p>
</details>

你知道，巴黎负责领导这项调查的首席检察官告诉我们，这些人经验丰富。他们认为他们是一个帮派的一部分。他们显然知道自己要来拿什么。他们非常精确和迅速，看起来一点也不惊慌。但所有这些都发生得相当快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what we have been told by the chief Paris prosecutor who is in charge of leading the investigation into this is that these are seasoned. They think that they're part of a gang. They clearly knew what they were coming for. They were pretty precise and fast and they didn't seem panicked at all. But all this was, you know, fairly quick.</p>
</details>

我们的时间线显示，他们于9:30抵达大楼外。四分钟后，他们爬上机械梯子顶部的窗户，闯入，并在四分钟内离开，然后消失了。所以，嗯，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our timeline shows that they arrived outside the building at 9:30. They got up to that window on the top of the mechanical ladder. Four minutes later, they broke in and they were out within four minutes and down and gone. So, um,</p>
</details>

Catherine: 太神奇了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">amazing.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 这速度相当快。我的意思是，我知道就盗窃案而言，这并不是最快的。有很多比这更快的。研究这些的人说这不算特别快，但足够快，他们成功逃脱了，而且他们还没有被找到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's pretty fast. I mean, I know in terms of heists, it's not the fastest. There have many faster. People who study this stuff say it's not crazy fast, but it was fast enough that they escaped and uh, they have not been found.</p>
</details>

### 逃脱与被盗珍宝

Natalie: 好的，我们来谈谈逃脱。我正在努力想象它。它到底是什么样子的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, okay, let's talk about that escape. I'm trying to imagine it. What does it actually look like?</p>
</details>

Catherine: 你知道，他们从进来的窗户跳出去。他们沿着同样的升降车梯子下去。我们还了解到，他们此时试图焚烧卡车和升降车本身。我们不知道为什么。有很多猜测说他们试图清除任何DNA或指纹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, they jump out the window that they came in. They go down the same bucket um ladder to the bottom. We understand also that they at this point attempt to um set fire to the truck to the bucket itself. We don't know why. There's been lots of speculation they were trying to remove any kind of DNA or fingerprints basically.</p>
</details>

此时，我们知道有一些保安人员在地面上追赶他们。他们掉落了一些东西，包括一件保安背心和他们用来向升降车喷洒气体以点燃它的瓶子。然后他们跳上两辆等候的摩托车，加速逃离。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at this point, what we know is that some security guard or guards come chasing towards them on the ground. They drop a couple things, including one of their security vests and the bottle that they were using to spray gas onto the this cherry bin to light it on fire. and they jump on the back of two waiting motorcycles and speed away.</p>
</details>

有一个非常有趣的细节是，他们掉落了他们最初抢到的九件物品中的一件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One, you know, very juicy detail is that they dropped one of the nine things they originally grabbed. I read that</p>
</details>

Natalie: 那是一顶极其珍贵的皇冠，是为法国末代皇后，也就是**拿破仑三世**（Napoleon III: 法兰西第二帝国皇帝）的妻子制作的帝国皇冠。我可以告诉你一些关于它的事情。我一直在学习很多这类东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it was this incredibly precious crown, an imperial crown that was made for the last empress of France who was married to Napoleon III. I can tell you a little bit about it. I have been learning a ton about these type of things.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 你现在简直是皇冠珠宝的世界专家了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're like the world's expert in crown jewels now.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 嗯，以前不是，但现在是了。等等。这顶皇冠上有八只金鹰，1354颗普通钻石，1136颗玫瑰切割钻石，以及56颗相当大的祖母绿。好的，所以他们掉了这顶皇冠，但他们确实成功拿走了八件物品。请告诉我它们是什么。其中一些最大的收获是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, not before this, but I have become one. Hold on. So, this crown had eight golden eagles on it. 1,354 regular diamonds and then 1,136 rose cut diamonds as well as 56 pretty sizable emeralds. Okay, so they dropped this crown, but they did manage to get eight items. Take me through what those were. What were some of the biggest gets?</p>
</details>

Catherine: 所以，嗯，你知道，再次，我关于皇室珠宝的速成课，很多这些物品都源于**拿破仑三世**或**拿破仑**（Napoleon: 法国军事家、政治家，法兰西第一帝国皇帝）本人。所以，我给你介绍几件。有一套令人难以置信的祖母绿项链和耳环套装，是拿破仑在1810年送给他第二任妻子的结婚礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, you know, again, my crash course on learning about royal jewelry, a lot of these items stem from either Napoleon III or Napoleon himself. So, I'll take you through a couple. There was this incredible emerald necklace and earring set that Napoleon gave to his second wife for their wedding in 1810.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 所以，这只是其中一件。然后是**欧仁妮皇后**（Empress Eugenie: 拿破仑三世的妻子，法国末代皇后）佩戴的装饰性蝴蝶结，上面有超过2000颗钻石。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's just one. Then there's this decorative bow that was worn by Empress Eugenei that has two thou more than 2,000 diamonds.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哦，天哪，我见过那张照片。我当时觉得很难看，即使在照片里也太闪亮了，你知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my god, I saw a picture of that one. I was like hard to look at. It was so shiny even just in the pictures, you know.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 还有一顶珍珠头饰，也令人惊叹。但娜塔莉，有一点表明这些窃贼知道他们在做什么，那就是他们没有去拿最昂贵的物品。在那些展柜里，他们选择了这些物品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's like a pearl um kind of tiar that's also incredibly jaw-dropping. But Natalie, one thing that points to that these thieves knew what they were doing is they didn't go for what was really the most expensive item. In those cases, they went for these items.</p>
</details>

有很多讨论说，也许他们认为这些物品更容易拆解，更容易熔化、分解并小块出售。但在那些展柜中，有一颗令人难以置信的钻石，被称为**摄政王钻石**（Regent Diamond: 一颗历史悠久、价值连城的著名钻石）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's a lots of discussion about, you know, maybe they thought these ones would be easier to break down and easier to um smelled and break apart and sell in small pieces. But you know among those cases is this incredible diamond that's known as the regent</p>
</details>

Natalie: 它是在18世纪早期被**奥尔良公爵**（Duke of Orlon: 法国贵族，曾担任法国摄政王）购买的，曾是**路易十五**（Louis XV: 法国波旁王朝国王）皇冠的中心装饰品，后来又被镶嵌在拿破仑的剑上，以及**路易十六**（Louis XVI: 法国波旁王朝末代国王）的皇冠上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was bought by the Duke of Orlon in like the early 1700s and was on the centerpiece of Louis X the 15th's crown and then later was on Napoleon's sword on Louis V 16th's crown</p>
</details>

Catherine: 它有李子那么大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's like the size of a plum.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哇。但许多珠宝专家表示，它太容易识别了，很难典当出去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. But lots of jewelry experts say it would be just far too easy to identify and really hard to pawn off.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 所以我们觉得这更像是一次商品抢劫，而不是为了某种古怪的专业收藏家而获取美丽的传世之宝，他们只想把东西独自藏在金库里。对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have a sense that this is more of a commodity grab than an attempt to get beautiful heritage pieces for some kind of kooky specialist collector who wants to hold things alone in a vault. Right?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 所以如果你追求商品，你就会寻找那些可以迅速拆解并小块出售的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if you're going for commodities, you're looking for things that can be quickly disassembled and sold in small pieces.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 对吧？这些窃贼是想把这些东西卖掉赚钱，而不是把它们挂在家里。我可以想象，卖一颗单独的钻石比卖一条独特的项链要容易得多，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? These are thieves. The idea is who are looking to sell these things and make money, not, you know, mount them in their homes. I can imagine it's a lot easier, right, to sell a single diamond than a distinctive necklace, for example.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对。你不能卖那条独特的项链，因为它已经被追踪了。你知道，**国际刑警组织**（Interpol: 国际刑事警察组织，旨在促进全球警务合作）已经把它列入了名单。你很快就会被抓到。但专家告诉我们，他们的想法是把它分解成小块，也许把一些大石头切割成小石头，这样就不那么容易识别了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Well, you can't sell that distinctive necklace because it's already been traced. You know, like Interpol has put it on its list. You would get caught very, very quickly. But the idea of what experts are telling us is is that you would break it down into small pieces, maybe carve some of the larger stones into smaller stones so they're less identifiable.</p>
</details>

你知道，一位专家说，你可以把它们串成不同款式的项链，然后以那种方式出售和典当。但如果你试图拍卖任何东西，人们肯定会保持警惕，寻找这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, one expert says you string them into a different kind of necklace and sell it and pawn it off that way. But certainly if you try and auction anything off, people will be on the alert looking for these things.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 我可以问一下吗，你知道，每个人都在谈论这些皇冠珠宝是无价之宝，但显然这些东西是可以估价的，对吧？我们知道他们偷走的物品价值多少吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask, you know, everybody's been talking about these crown jewels as priceless, but obviously there is a price that you can attach to these things, right? Do we know what was the worth of the things they stole?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的，我们刚刚得知。直到现在，关于他们可能偷走了多少钱有很多猜测，但调查负责人几分钟前刚刚在公共电台表示，他们的估价是这些物品价值8800万欧元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we just found out. Up until now, there's been lots of speculation about how much they might have escaped with, but the head of the investigation just went on public radio literally minutes ago and said that the estimation they have is they are worth 88 million.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WA,</p>
</details>

Natalie: 这是一大笔钱。但她也说了一件有趣的事情。她说：“看，你知道，如果你把它们拆开熔化，它们的价值会大大降低。”在某种程度上，这几乎是在恳求窃贼，就像“请不要这样做，你知道，你不会赚到那么多钱”，这是我们在办公室里解读的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">which is a ton. But she also said this interesting thing. She said, "Look, you know, if you were to break them apart and melt them down, they'd be worth a lot less." in some ways almost beseeching to the the thieves like please don't do this you know you're not going to make as much money as is as how uh we read it in in the office</p>
</details>

Catherine: 你认为出于什么目的？是为了保持这些珍贵物品的完整性吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for what purpose do you think out of a desire to keep these precious items intact?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的。我的意思是，即使它们价值8800万欧元，我认为对于法国这个国家及其历史来说，它们的价值要高得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, even if they're worth 88 million euros, I think to the country of France and the history of the country, they're worth a ton more.</p>
</details>

从历史、象征和文化角度来看，这些东西是无价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Historically, symbolically, culturally, these things are priceless.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为在某些方面，很多人一直在谈论它们的价值，但实际上，对于这个国家来说，这种损失更多是情感上的，而不是经济上的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I think in some ways, a lot of people have been talking about, you know, how much they'd be worth, but really the loss is more emotional for the country than I think it is financial.</p>
</details>

### 法国人民的反应与历史背景

Natalie: 好的，我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll be right back.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 所以，我想问一下对这些事件的反应。如果假设这些窃贼会把这些东西分解，也许熔化黄金，出售零件，尽可能多地赚钱，法国人民对这种可能性有什么反应？这个国家的历史可能会消失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I want to ask just about the reaction to some of this. If the assumption is that these thieves are going to break these things down, maybe melt down the gold, sell it for parts, make as much money as possible, how are French people responding to that possibility? It is the history of this country that could be disappeared.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 我认为主要的反应是震惊，而不是对这些东西被熔化的想法本身，而是对周日早上发生的一切。这些人能如此轻易地进入卢浮宫，引发了许多不同的情感反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the predominant reaction has been shock and not that at the idea of these things being melted down per se, but just at the whole like what happened on Sunday morning. The fact that these people could that easily get into the Louv has caused, you know, a lot of different kinds of emotional reactions.</p>
</details>

有愤怒。人们感到震惊。有些人对此非常激动。这个国家的司法部长说，这无疑是失败的标志。我们失败了。它已经被政治化了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's been anger. People are stunned. Some people are quite emotional about it. the country's justice minister. He said that this is certain sign of a failure. We have failed. It has been politicized.</p>
</details>

有人，特别是右翼人士，指责政府没有投入足够的资金用于安全。有人质疑卢浮宫的安全状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's been people particularly on the right wing of the spectrum blaming the government for not putting enough money into security. There's been questions about what is the the security of the lou.</p>
</details>

人们只是哀叹，这种事情竟然会发生在法国，甚至可能是世界上最著名、游客最多、最受追捧、保护最严密的博物馆的市中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's just been sort of people bemoning the fact that this could happen in the center of the city in the the most famous, most visited, most coveted, most protected museum in France and likely the world.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 对。你描述的这种反应听起来像是一种自我质疑，因为这个地区人流量如此之大。这怎么可能发生？对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. The reaction that you're describing sounds like it's one of a sense of self questioning that's happening because of just how highly traffic this area was. How could this possibly occur? Right.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 是的，有这种感觉，也有悲剧感。这个国家曾眼睁睁看着**巴黎圣母院**（Notre Dame: 巴黎著名大教堂）差点被烧毁，人们含泪站在塞纳河畔，许多人跪着观看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. There's that sense and also just the sense of tragedy. This country watched the NRAAM almost burn down and people lined the banks of the Sen with tears in their eyes. You know, many of them kneeling watching it.</p>
</details>

我认为住在这里的法国人，他们在文化上非常批判。他们喜欢罢工。他们喜欢抱怨。他们相当挑剔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think French people living here, they are very critical culturally. They're people who like to strike. They like to complain. They're pretty critical,</p>
</details>

但他们热爱自己的历史。如果你走进一家法国书店，大约每四本书中就有一本是历史书。人们了解自己的历史。他们参观博物馆。这在法国人民心中是一个非常重要的文化场所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but they love their history. If you go into a French bookstore, like one out of every four books is a history book. People know their history. They visit the museums. This is like a a very important cultural place in in French people's hearts. And</p>
</details>

我认为人们感到震惊、震惊，并在一定程度上感到悲痛。真正有趣的是，你知道，法国实际上没有大量的这类皇室珠宝，因为大革命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think people are appalled, shocked, and really grieving to a degree. The thing that's really interesting is that, you know, France doesn't actually have a huge amount of royal jewels like this because of the revolution.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 解释一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Explain that.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 所以，你知道，以国王和王后被斩首而告终的大革命。当时，卢浮宫被洗劫一空。许多东西被盗，包括一些珠宝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, the revolution which ended in the beheading of the king and queen at the time. At that time, the the Louv was sacked. A lot of things were stolen, including some of the jewels.</p>
</details>

但后来，你知道，法国与它的皇室历史关系复杂。它是一个非常自豪的共和国。在其中一个共和国时期，他们决定将剩余的皇室珠宝拍卖掉。这就是他们在19世纪末所做的。他们拍卖了大量的这些珠宝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then, you know, France has a really ambivalent relationship with its royal history. It's a very proud republic. And during one of those republics, they decided that they were going to take what was left of the royal jewels and auction them off. And that's what they did in the late 1800s. They auctioned off tons of these jewels.</p>
</details>

令人难以置信的是，其中大部分被一位美国人买走，他是**蒂芙尼**（Tiffany's: 著名珠宝品牌）的创始人之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And incredibly, the lion share of them were bought by an American who was a founder of Tiffany's.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 哦，哇。所以，嗯，你知道，卢浮宫几十年来一直在努力把它们要回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, wow. So, um, you know, the the Lou has been spending decades now trying to get them back.</p>
</details>

### 博物馆盗窃案频发与调查进展

Catherine: 在阅读这个故事时，我了解到这是今年法国博物馆发生的几起盗窃案之一。你能告诉我其他一些事件吗？到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In reading about this story, I learned that this is one of several thefts from French museums this year. Can you tell me about some of those other episodes? Like, what is going on?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的，就在本周，一家小型博物馆连续两次被盗，我们当时还在考虑是否要报道这个故事。所以，当这件事发生时，我觉得很有趣，我当时想：“哦，天哪。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, even this week there was a small museum that was burgled twice in a row and we were looking at like, should we do a story on this? So, it was funny that when this happened, I was like, "Oh my god."</p>
</details>

但是的，上个月有人闯入了自然历史博物馆，它离卢浮宫只有几个地铁站的距离，他们使用了类似的工具，切开了几个展柜，偷走了大量熔化的原金，然后逃走了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, last month someone went into the natural history museum, which is only a couple subway stops away from the Louv, and using kind of similar tools, cut into some cases and took out a bunch of molten raw gold and made off with them.</p>
</details>

同一个月，上个月，在巴黎西南部的利摩日，窃贼闯入一家博物馆，偷走了一些古代瓷器。去年11月，窃贼在白天使用棍棒闯入了一家离我坐的地方不远、也相当著名的博物馆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the same month, last month, a museum down in Limoge, southwest of Paris, thieves broke into a museum and stole some ancient China. In November of last year, thieves using bats went in during the day also to a quite famous museum not far away from where I'm sitting.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，现在法国确实有一连串这样的事件，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, there's definitely a streak of these right now, right, in France.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 有没有迹象表明这些抢劫案之间有任何关联？我的意思是，我只是想知道，感觉这就像是另一个时代的事情，你有一连串的博物馆抢劫案，你知道，我想知道这些窃贼是否以某种方式合作，即使是松散的，或者他们出于类似的原因针对这些博物馆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there an understanding that these robberies are connected in any way? I mean, I'm just wondering, it does feel like it's out of another era that you have this string of museum robberies, you know, and I'm wondering if the thieves either are in any way working together, even loosely, or are targeting the museums for similar reasons.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 没有迹象表明人们正在合作。是的，这看起来非常老式，除了一个方面。这件事发生在光天化日之下，你知道，当时博物馆里有人，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no indication that people are working together. Yes, this seems very old-fashioned, except for in one way. This happened in broad daylight, you know, when people were in the museum, right?</p>
</details>

Catherine: 这相当新颖。这里有一家现代艺术博物馆，曾因在半夜被盗而闻名，一名男子偷走了五幅非常著名的画作。他以一种经典的方式做到了，就像你脑海中电影里想的那样，这里被称为**《亚森·罗宾》**（Lupin: 一部法国犯罪悬疑剧集，讲述一位绅士盗贼的故事）。如果你没看过，一定要看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's pretty new. There's a modern art museum here that was famously burgled in the middle of the night and a man made off with five very famous tableau. And he did it in a classic way like when you're thinking about the movie in your head, which here is known as Lup. It's a very famous series. If you haven't seen it, definitely watch it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 我看过。是的。我感觉我现在正在现实生活中观看它。但是，你知道，它很隐秘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've seen it. Yeah. I I feel like I'm watching it in real life right now. But, you know, like it's it's secret.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 而且通常是在晚上，或者以某种人们看不到它发生的方式。这次非常大胆，因为我们知道卢浮宫周围到处都是**闭路电视**（CCTV: Closed-Circuit Television，闭路电视监控系统）摄像头。当时甚至有人在场。所以，这有点不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And often that's at night or in some way that people don't see it happening. This is like a very brazen in that we do know that, you know, there's CCTV cameras all around the Louv. There were people there even. So, it's a little bit different.</p>
</details>

首席调查员正在谈论这起事件组织得令人难以置信。她认为不仅仅是四个人。她认为有更多人参与其中。所以，我们对闯入卢浮宫的这四个人一无所知。所以，你知道，很难说有什么联系，但显然他们要么是在模仿，要么有某个犯罪团伙在资助他们。这些问题，你知道，我们希望在未来几周内能够回答。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the lead investigator is talking about this being like incredibly organized. She doesn't think there was just four people. She thinks that there's many more involved in this. So, we don't know anything about these four guys who broke into the Lou, though. So, you know, it's hard to say um what kind of connections, but clearly they're either copycatting or there's some ring that's sponsoring them. Those are questions that, you know, we hope to be able to answer in the weeks to come.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 调查的下一步是什么？调查人员告诉你们关于追捕这些人、关于他们的调查策略是什么？我们知道他们是如何试图抓住他们的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the next steps in the investigation? Like, what are the investigators telling you about the manhunt for these guys, about their investigative strategies? Do we know how they're going about trying to catch them?</p>
</details>

Natalie: 不。我们知道的是，最初有60名警察调查员参与此案。现在，我们知道已增加到100人。我们知道他们一直在使用DNA方法、指纹识别。他们一直在使用监控摄像头。我们知道卡车被留下了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. What we do know is that there were 60 police investigators on the case. Now, we know it's up to 100. We know that they've been using DNA methods, fingerprinting. They've been using surveillance cameras. We know that the truck was left behind.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 是的。他们没能烧掉它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. They didn't manage to burn it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 他们没能烧掉它。我们知道他们最近基本上是偷了它。所以调查人员正在与被偷卡车的人交谈。但这就是调查人员告诉我们的主要内容。他们目前对此守口如瓶。我认为一旦他们找到这些人，他们会说更多。但有一种真实的感觉，这是一场与时间的赛跑，要在这些珍贵珠宝被分解并秘密藏匿之前抓住他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They didn't manage to burn it. We know that they had just recently basically stolen it. And so investigators are speaking to the person they stole it from. But that's the gist of what we've been told by investigators. They are being incredibly tight- lipped about it at this point. I think they will speak more once and if they find them. But there's a real feeling that there's a race against time to try and get them before these precious jewels are broken apart and secreted away.</p>
</details>

Catherine: 凯瑟琳，我最后一个问题是，你认为这些窃贼真的有可能成功逃脱吗？听起来似乎有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My final question for you, Catherine, is do you think it's possible? And it sounds like it might be that these thieves actually pulled this off, like that they could get away with it.</p>
</details>

Natalie: 是的。我的意思是，我认为我们可能永远不会再看到那些珠宝了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think it's possible that we will never see those jewels again,</p>
</details>

但法国在抓捕这些罪犯方面有很好的记录。事实上，据称闯入自然历史博物馆的人今天刚刚被起诉。她在巴塞罗那被捕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think France has a pretty good record of capturing some of these people. In fact, the person who is said to have broken into the Natural History Museum was just charged today. She was captured in Barcelona.</p>
</details>

我认为考虑到警察拥有的摄像头数量和证据，他们将能够追查到这些人是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think given the amount of cameras um and evidence that the cops have that they will be able to trace who these men were.</p>
</details>

如果有人试图出售，你知道，我们之前谈到的那个美丽的钻石蝴蝶结，那么毫无疑问他们会被抓住，它也会被归还。这是最好的情况。但如果他们把那一千多颗钻石中的每一颗都取下来，然后用它们制作出完全不同的东西，也许是一顶头饰，我不知道，一个脚链，或者一个非常富有的人的手链，那么一开始谁会注意到呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If someone tries to sell, you know, that beautiful diamond bow that we were talking about earlier, then no doubt they'll get caught and it will be returned. And that is the best case scenario. But if they take each of those thousand plus diamonds off and make something entirely different out of it, maybe a tiara, I don't know, an anklet, a bracelet for a very rich person, then who would notice at first?</p>
</details>

你需要一个专家才能追溯那些钻石到那个蝴蝶结。所以，在这种情况下，这些美丽的法国遗产能够物归原主的可能性似乎要小得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You would need to be an expert to be able to trace those diamonds to that bow. So, it seems much less likely in this case that these beautiful pieces of French heritage will make their way back.</p>
