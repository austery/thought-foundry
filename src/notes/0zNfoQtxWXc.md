### 欢迎与罗伯特·金塞尔共话音乐人生

**Nicolola:** 大家好，欢迎来到“良伴同行”播客。我是挪威主权财富基金的首席执行官尼古拉·坦根。今天，我非常荣幸地邀请到了华纳音乐集团（全球最大的唱片公司之一）的首席执行官罗伯特·金塞尔先生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody and welcome to in good company. I'm Nicolola Tangan the CEO of the Norwegian So wealth fund and today I'm in really good company with Robert Kinsel the CEO of Warner Music Group one of the world's largest record labels.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 华纳音乐集团旗下拥有众多杰出艺人，包括我最喜欢的酷玩乐队、艾德·希兰、杜瓦·利帕，甚至还有挪威传奇乐队Aha。罗伯特，非常高兴能邀请您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now they have incredible artists including my favorite co-play Ed Sharon Dualipa and even the Norwegian legends. Aha. Very good Robert. What a pleasure to have you on.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 彼此彼此，非常感谢。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Same here. Thank you so much.</p>
</details>

### 早年经历与价值观的塑造

**Nicolola:** 好的，我们得从您的起点聊起。您出生在捷克，您的成长背景是如何塑造您成为今天的领导者的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now we need to kind of kick off with uh with your beginning. you were born in uh Czecha and so how does your background shape you as the leader you are today?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 实际上，我出生和成长的时候，那里是**捷克斯洛伐克**（Czechoslovakia: 1918年至1992年间存在于中欧的一个国家，后分裂为捷克和斯洛伐克）。在我的一生中，这个国家曾三次更名。这或许说明了我可能已经习惯了变化，但它塑造我的方式很有趣。我的父母，母亲是老师，父亲是医生，在一个社会主义共产主义社会中，他们的收入并不高。但他们灌输给我和妹妹的价值观，实际上在美国这个资本主义世界中依然适用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So actually you know when I was born and grew up it was Czechoslovakia the country rebranded three times in my lifetime. Um it tells you something about change that I'm probably used to but uh the way it shaped me was interesting. My parents, my mom was a teacher, my dad was a doctor, uh, you know, in a socialist communist society, uh, not earning much, but the values they instilled in my sister and I actually apply in the, you know, capitalist world in United States.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 例如，他们总是强调教育的价值，因为教育是任何人都无法从你身边夺走的。当你经历像**国有化**（Nationalization: 政府将私有资产或产业转变为国有资产或产业的行为）这样的事情时，捷克斯洛伐克的人们习惯于失去他们的财产，但你无法失去你的教育。所以我的父母非常重视这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh for instance to always value education because education is something nobody can take away from you when you go through something like nationalization in in Czechoslovakia people are used to losing their possessions but you cannot lose your education. So our parents were really focused on that or you know my dad would</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 又比如，我父亲会说，我曾是一名竞技**越野滑雪运动员**（Cross-country skier: 一种在雪地上进行长距离滑行的运动，强调耐力与技巧），每当我表现不佳，比如装备出了问题等等，我父亲就会说：“哦，那太棒了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">say whenever I I was a competitive athlete crosscountry skier and whenever I would fail somehow my equipment failed etc my dad would be like oh that's great</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 他会说：“没人会记得你的固定器坏了，但每个人都会记得你的排名。”这对我来说是早期的警醒之一：借口真的不重要，因为即使是好的借口也会被遗忘。真正重要的是结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know nobody's going to remember the fact that your bindings failed but everybody's going to remember your ranking and uh and it was one of those wakeup calls to me early on that excuses don't really matter because those are forgotten even if they're good ones. and that it's only the results that matter.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 我得说，如果您真的是一名优秀的越野滑雪运动员，那您可能搬错了国家，您应该搬到挪威，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to say if you were a really good cross or you moved to the wrong country, you should have moved to Norway, right?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我知道，我知道有很多挪威人曾把我们打得落花流水。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I know I know there are a lot of Norwegians who were kicking our butt.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 确实如此。但您从小也对音乐很感兴趣，对吧？您会演奏几种乐器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. But you were also interested in music from early on, right? You played a couple of instruments.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 是的，非常感兴趣。有句话说，每个捷克人都是音乐家。这个国家有着深厚的古典音乐根基，我妹妹弹钢琴，我拉大提琴，拉了大约三年后，我又开始弹西班牙吉他。我的老师非常棒，他是一位盲人老师，同时也是一名滑雪运动员。所以我曾是他的滑雪老师兼向导，他则教我这美妙的艺术，我们之间保持了很长一段美好的关系。顺便说一句，我大约六个月前刚和他重新取得联系，这真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, very much. Uh you know there's a saying that every Czech is a musician. Uh and there are deep classical music roots in the country and my sister played a piano. I played cello and then after playing cello for about three years I then played Spanish guitar and my teacher actually is wonderful. He was a blind teacher who was a skier as well. So I was his teacher and I was this guide for skiing and uh and he was teaching me this wonderful uh art and uh it was a great long relationship and by the way I just reconnected with him about six months ago which is incredible.</p>
</details>

### 职业生涯：从邮件收发室到科技巨头

**Nicolola:** 太好了。在您担任华纳音乐集团首席执行官之前，您在HBO、Netflix和YouTube都取得了令人瞩目的成就。能带我们回顾一下这段旅程吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's good. Now, you've been um you've been doing incredible work at HBO, Netflix, uh and YouTube before you stepped in as a CEO of Warner Music Group. So, just um take us through the the journey here.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我和许多人一样，在一个**人才中介公司**（Talent agency: 专门代理艺人、模特、作家等创意人才，为其寻找工作机会并协商合同的公司）没有窗户的邮件收发室开始工作，把照片和简历钉在一起寄给选角经纪人。那是我卑微的起点，直到我被提升为助理。我职业生涯的前三年基本上都在做这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I started like many others in a windowless mail room in a talent agency, stapling pictures together with resumes which got mailed to casting agents. Those were my humble beginnings until I got promoted to an assistant. And I was pretty much doing this for the first three years of my career.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 之后，我早期加入了一家**共同基金公司**（Mutual fund company: 集合众多投资者的资金，由专业基金经理管理，投资于股票、债券等多种资产的公司），它在90年代初是一家电影联合融资公司。在那里我学会了如何评估内容的价值、如何为其付费以及如何分发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then early on I joined a mutual fund company which was a movie uh co-inancing company early on in in in the 90s and that's what I learned how to value content how it's paid for and how it's distributed from there went to HBO</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 之后我去了HBO，那时它正处于巅峰时期，有《欲望都市》、《黑道家族》等热门剧集。我在国际部门工作，负责在各地推出HBO，比如HBO印度、HBO韩国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh that was at its height uh you know Sex in the City Sopranos etc and I worked on the international side launching territories HBO India HBO Korea and then uh then I did a about</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 接着，我在2000年加入了一家由**风险投资**（VC funded startup: 获得风险投资公司资金支持的初创企业）资助的初创公司，做了大约三年的时间。那是一个冒险的举动，从如日中天的HBO跳到一家完全不知名的互联网公司，而且当时互联网发展缓慢，正好赶上2000年3月的**互联网泡沫破裂**（dot-com bust: 2000年左右互联网公司估值泡沫破裂，大量公司倒闭的事件）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">threeear stint in a a VC funded startup in the year 2000 that was like a risky move right from high-flying HBO to completely unknown company on the internet which was just slow you know right as the bust happened right in March 2000 the docom bust and uh uh but</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但我们的公司挺了过来，三年内我加入了Netflix。那时Netflix大约有50万订阅用户，主要业务是**DVD邮寄**（DVD by mail: Netflix早期通过邮寄DVD光盘给订阅用户提供电影租赁服务）。到了2005年，我们开始专注于流媒体，因为我们知道总有一天要转型业务，颠覆我们自己的颠覆。所以我开始着手这项工作，组建了团队，接下来的故事大家都知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know our company we we were uh working through it and within 3 years I ended up at Netflix which at that time had roughly 500,000 subscribers and I was you know DVD by mail and then 2005 started to focus on streaming because we we knew at some point we wanted to transition the business and disrupt our own disruption and uh so I I started to work on that, built up the team and you know the rest is history.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 2010年，我被谷歌招募，加入了YouTube，并帮助它发展成为今天的样子。当时YouTube的营收大约是4.5亿美元，规模很小，非常混乱，被很多人起诉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in 2010 uh I was recruited uh to Google and and joined YouTube and helped basically grow it into what it is today. And you know at that time it was roughly $450 million in revenue. was small, was very messy, sued by lots of different people.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 埃里克·施密特（Eric Schmidt）告诉我：“想办法让他们停止给我们寄纸质文件，而是我们给他们寄纸质文件，也就是钱。实现商业化，修复关系，建立业务。”我们和许多其他人一起做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh and Eric Schmidt told me, "Figure out how you stop them from sending us paper and instead we send them paper, meaning money, commercialize, you know, fix the relationships, commercialize it, and build a business." And um you know, and we did that, you know, along with lots of other people.</p>
</details>

### 转型音乐产业：为何选择音乐？

**Nicolola:** 您为什么会转型到音乐产业呢？当您在Netflix和YouTube这样拥有“**曲棍球棒式增长**”（Hockey sticks: 商业领域中形容销售额、用户数等指标呈现出先平缓后急剧上升的曲线，形似曲棍球棒）的公司工作时，它们都是巨大的颠覆性力量，规模已经非常庞大。Netflix或YouTube，不可能再变得更大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um why did you transition into the music industry? when you when you have two sort of hockey sticks like this, you know, two uh big uh disrupt uh disruptive forces scaling, it doesn't really get any bigger than that, right? Netflix or YouTube, it doesn't get any bigger.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，你必须把目光投向一些更小、更专注的事物。我选择音乐是因为我热爱音乐，我们之前也聊过。我认为音乐拥有这种令人难以置信的**无处不在**（Ubiquitous: 普遍存在、无处不在的）力量。世界上每个人都与音乐有着某种联系，每个人都有自己人生的“配乐”。音乐就像一个**时间戳**（Time stamp: 记录特定时刻的标记），你生命中充满了各种时间戳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you have to actually set your sights on something smaller and and more focused. So, I chose music because I love music. Uh we spoke about that. Uh I think music has this incredible power of being absolutely ubiquitous. Everybody in the world has some kind of relationship with music and uh everybody has a soundtrack to their life. Music is like a time stamp basically. You know there's a bunch of time stamps throughout your life.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我最喜欢的一句话是：艺术装饰墙壁，而音乐装饰时间。我认为这非常强大。正因为如此，音乐产业虽然会经历起伏，但它具有韧性，能够克服所有低谷。我认为在一个公司转型时期工作非常有趣，从它过去的形态转变为它将来的新形态。我发现这在智力上很有刺激性，而且工作起来也很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um you know I have this favorite saying that art decorates walls but music decorates time. And I think that's very powerful. And because of that music goes through ups and downs in the industry but it's resilient and gets through all the downs. And I think it's incredibly interesting to work in a company transitioning company from one thing that it that it has been to something new that it that it will be. And uh I just find that intellectually stimulating and it's it's fun to work on that.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 当你重聚时播放当时的音乐，那感觉真是太棒了。我的意思是，你仿佛回到了过去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's amazing when you have reunions and you put on the music, you play it at the time. I mean my you are just back there, you know.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 是的，没错。它确实能唤起情感，对吧？这就是音乐的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly. No, but it invokes emotions, right? That's that's what happens.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您现在听什么音乐？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you listen to now?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，显然，我会在我们艺人的音乐发行前听所有他们的作品，我们有一个内部系统来处理这些。所以我都会听，这很有趣，对吧？然后试着想象它会如何表现，再看看它实际的表现。所以我喜欢和自己玩这个游戏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh uh well obviously I listen to all of our artists before their music is released, you know, sort of like an internal system for that. So I do all of it and it's kind of fun to do that, right? And then kind of try to imagine how that's going to do and then kind of look how it's doing. So So I like playing that game with myself.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您的预测能力如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is your predictive power?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，不太好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's uh it's not so great.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 为什么您觉得会这样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why and why and why do you think that is?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 因为我还没有真正应用任何系统。我只是凭感觉行事。我认为你需要做的是，你必须有一种**有章可循的方法**（Method to the madness: 指在看似混乱的行为背后，实际上存在着某种逻辑或系统）。你必须找出一些遵循的模式，然后最终你会开始稍微缩小范围，你会变得更好。我注意到这里许多在**艺人与曲目部门**（A&R: Artists and Repertoire: 艺人与曲目部门，负责发现、培养艺人，并管理其作品）工作的人，他们在寻找艺人、选择艺人、思考热门歌曲等方面都有不同的方法。但他们都有一个系统，我认为拥有自己的系统非常非常重要，因为它能让你进步和变得更好。所以我自己还没有这个系统，我只是把它当作一种乐趣来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because I haven't really applied any system to it. I'm just doing purely by a feel. And I think what you have to do is you have to have some kind of a method to the madness. You have to figure out some patterns that you follow and then eventually you start narrowing your scope a little bit and and and you get better at it. And and I noticed that lots of uh folks who work here say in ANR they have different approaches to finding artists, selecting artists, thinking about hits, etc. But they they they have a system and I think that's very very important to to have your system because it just allows you to you know progress and get better and so I don't have it myself yet. I just kind of do it for fun on the side.</p>
</details>

### 科技公司与创意公司的文化差异

**Nicolola:** 我问过Spotify的创始人丹尼尔·埃克（Daniel Ek），他觉得我应该问您什么问题。所以他有一个问题。我问过很多人，您看。他的问题是，从YouTube这样的科技公司转型到华纳音乐集团这样的创意公司，您必须做出最大的文化调整是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I asked Daniel Eek the founder of uh you know Spotify what he thought I should ask you and so he had a question here. I've asked a lot of people you see. So um what's what his uh question is what's what's been the biggest cultural adjustment you have to make going from a technology company first like YouTube to a creative company like uh Warner Music Group.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为有两点，我将列举两点。第一点是，我认为数字世界中的每个人对内容公司都有一个不公平的假设，那就是他们不喜欢技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there there are two I'll name two. The first one is uh I think there is this unfair assumption that everybody in digital world has of let's say uh content companies that that they don't like technology. Uh and when you</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 当你进入像华纳音乐这样的公司时，你会发现所有员工都想要技术。他们在个人生活中都拥有技术，他们有银行应用，有私人司机应用，无论是什么，他们都很好地在线生活着。但他们可能在职业生活中没有这些。不是因为他们不想要，只是因为这些工具还没有为他们开发出来，也还没有提供给他们，但他们确实想要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">come into a company uh like Warner Music, the what you realize that all employees want it. They all have it in their personal lives. They have their banking apps. They have their, you know, private chauffeur apps. Whatever it is, they're living their life online like very very well, but they may not have it in their professional life. Not because they don't want it. It just hasn't been built for them and u hasn't been made available, but they want it.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我之前的假设是“是的，人们不想要它”，但他们实际上想要。所以我们一直在努力解决这个问题，并尽可能提供这些工具。这是其中一点，这是一个非常令人愉快的惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think there's just been this my assumption was like, yeah, people don't want it. They actually do. So, we've been working really hard to obviously fix that and and provide as as many of these tools as possible. So, that's one. So, there was a very pleasant surprise.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我想说，另一个文化上的差异是，大多数媒体公司的组织结构都非常分散，拥有许多不同的**损益中心**（P&Ls: Profit and Loss: 损益表，衡量公司在特定时期内的财务表现）和基础设施。在当今世界，全球性公司可以以更简单得多的设置来运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would say the the other is uh uh culturally the organizations in most media companies are set up in very distributed manners with lots of different P&Ls and lots of different infrastructures and in today's world they can function like global companies can function in much much simpler setup.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以我认为，这必须伴随着文化变革，它不能自行发生。但我认为这是一个重要的文化差异，比如与科技公司或其他行业中许多公司相比，这些公司已经采用了更简单的组织设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think but that doesn't that has to come with cultural change right it cannot happen on its own but I think that's a that's a an important cultural difference let's say from technology companies or from you know a whole bunch of companies in other industries which uh have come up with a simpler organizational design</p>
</details>

### 音乐产业的演变：发行与喧嚣

**Nicolola:** 罗伯特，音乐产业现在似乎正在以多种方式发生变化，对吧？它在许多不同的维度上都在变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robert there seems to be so many ways the music industry is changing just now right uh it's changing in so many different dimensions um</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您认为我们现在看到的主要变化或最重要的变化是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think are the main changes we are seeing just now or the most important ones</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 显然，有一个巨大的变化，我本人也是其中的一部分，那就是**发行民主化**（Democratization of distribution: 指数字技术使得内容分发变得更加容易和普遍，降低了进入门槛）。是的，过去音乐公司是负责实体发行的，存在大量的库存问题、货架空间问题等等，都需要解决。而今天，数字发行更简单，任何人都可以发布音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one obviously there's one big change which I obviously was part of which is democratization of distribution. Yeah. Right. Uh the the uh music companies uh were the ones who got you distributed in a physical format. Right. There was lots of inventory issues and shelf space issues and all of that to get sorted out. And today it's in digital distribution. It's simpler and anyone can publish.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以我们或音乐公司在发行中所扮演的角色已经减弱了。当然，它仍然有其作用，因为它必须通过供应链推送到许多不同的分发点，其中涉及复杂性。但与过去相比，它的重要性已经降低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the role that we or the music companies played in distribution has decreased. Obviously uh there is still a role for it because it has to get pushed through supply chains into many different distribution points and there's complexity involved with that. But it's it's decreased versus the past.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 然而，在一个任何人都可以发布音乐的世界里，没有人能被听到。噪音水平大大增加，以至于很难独自成功，而且是持续性的成功。你可能会有一次性的成功，但如果你想以此为职业，想要成功，想要建立**音乐目录**（Catalog: 音乐产业中指一家公司或艺人拥有的所有已发行歌曲和录音的集合），想要创造大量价值，那是一项非常困难的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in a world where anyone can publish, no one can be heard. The level of noise increases so much that it's really hard to succeed on your own. on a repeated basis. You can have like a one-off success, but if you want to do this as a career, you want to succeed, you want to build catalog, you want to build lots of value, it's a very uh it's it's a difficult job.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 为此，你需要一个团队和全球基础设施，我们这些大公司拥有这些。你需要遍布全球的基础设施来帮助你**突破喧嚣**（Break through the clutter: 在信息过载的环境中脱颖而出，吸引注意力）。这需要技术和创意能力的结合。因为你需要收集大量不同的数据并知道如何使用它们，还需要围绕每个艺人及其品牌和艺术进行创意发挥。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for that, you need a team and you need global infrastructure, which we have, you know, the the large companies, you need global infrastructure all around the world that helps you break through the clutter. And that becomes a combination of both uh technology because you need to collect lots of different data and know how to use it and also creative prowess around each of the artists and what to do with their brand and with their art.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，它已经成为一种更加整合的业务，在全球范围内结合了技术和创意，同时我们仍然拥有可以在任何地方释放的基础设施。因此，我认为我们的价值已经发生了转变：在发行方面的价值有所下降，而在**突破喧嚣**方面的价值有所增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so it's become uh much more sort of integrated business between technology and creative on the global scale still with with infrastructure that we can unleash everywhere. So I think our value has shifted decreased on the distribution side and increased on breaking through the clutter.</p>
</details>

### 艺人发展：如何发现和培养人才

**Nicolola:** 作为一家唱片公司，您在这里增加的最重要价值是什么？它在艺人的生命周期中又是如何变化的呢？我们先从头说起。您是如何发现艺人的，以及在初期您会提供哪些帮助？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the most important thing you you add here um as a record label and then how does it change during the life cycle of an artist? Let's just start with the beginning. How do you how do how do you find them and what do you add in the beginning?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我会告诉您，我们公司在很早阶段发现艺人方面拥有卓越的基因和历史。无论是艾德·希兰、布鲁诺·马尔斯、杜瓦·利帕、卡迪·B、扎克·布莱恩、本森·布恩等等，不胜枚举。所以，**艺人发展**（Artist development: 唱片公司或管理团队为艺人提供培训、指导和支持，帮助他们提升技能、建立品牌和发展职业生涯的过程）是我们工作的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll uh I'll I'll give you so so we are one of the companies that actually has a great DNA and history in discovering artists very early. Yeah. Whether it was uh Ed Sheeran, uh Bruno Mars, Dual Lipa, Cardi B, um Zack Brian, you know, Benson Boon, etc. It could go on. So artist development is very core to what we do.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我刚开始工作时，每次遇到艺人，我都会问他们。他们会告诉我：“哦，你们公司有一些很棒的人，太棒了。”我就会问：“是啊，告诉我名字。”他们会立刻告诉我名字。我就会立刻发一封邮件给那个人。很多时候他们都是中层管理人员。所以我就会说：“嘿，我想见你。”然后我就会和他们见面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I sat down with, you know, when I started, every time I ran into an artist, I would ask, you know, they would tell me, "Oh, you have some amazing people in your company. It's awesome." I was like, "Yeah, tell me who." And they would give me the names immediately. I just stepped up an email and emailed that person. And so many times they're like mid-level executives. And so I was like, "Hey, I'd like to meet you." So I would meet with them.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 有一次，我遇到了一位**艺人与曲目部门**（A&R: Artists and Repertoire: 艺人与曲目部门，负责发现、培养艺人，并管理其作品）的高管，我问了她同样的问题：“你是如何发现艺人的？如何找到你相信会发展成为超级巨星的人？”她告诉我，她甚至在听他们的声音之前，会先寻找他们与观众的联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So So there was this one ANR exec that um that I met with and I was asking her the same question. How do you find artists? how do you find somebody that you believe in that you think is going to develop in a superstar? And she was telling me, um, I look for their connection with the audience before I even listen to their voice.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我当时想，哦，这很有趣。你是怎么做到的？你是看网上的点赞数，还是评论等等？她说：“不，我观察观众。”我问：“你是什么意思？”她又说：“是现场直播吗？”她说：“不，我去现场演出。”我当时想，要知道，她是一个非常年轻的高管，二十多岁。我当时想，我以为那是那些老一辈的A&R人士才做的事情。她说：“我也那样做。”我问：“那你是怎么做的？”她说：“我观察观众，如果观众与艺人之间存在情感联系，那是无价的，而且非常棒。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was thinking, oh, it's interesting. How do you do that? You you you look at the likes online or like how do you discern or comments, etc. He's like, no, I'm watching the audience. I was like, what do you mean? And like and live stream like no, I go to the shows. I was like and you know this is a very young executive by the way like you know in 20s and I was like well but I thought that's what the older ANR guys were doing. I was like well I do that too. I was like and how does that work? She's like well I watch the audience and if the audience is an emotional connection to the artist that is priceless and it's and it's it's amazing.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 如果这种联系存在，而且这种联系要么是他们眼含泪水或哭泣，要么是他们尖叫或大笑。如果这种联系存在，那么我们就会与他们合作，发展他们的艺术和声音，培养他们的艺人技能，因为这种联系已经存在。现在我们就有了一些可以真正建立长久职业生涯的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if it's there and by the way the connection is either they're they have misty eyes or crying or they're shrieking or they're laughing. And if it's there, then we work with them on the art and develop their voice and just like develop the artist skill set and the connection is there. And now now we have something that we can really build a longlast long-lasting career on.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我觉得很有趣。她说：“你知道什么很重要吗？如果艺人是女性，那么观众是青少年女孩，因为她们是最早的**早期采用者**（Earliest adopters: 在产品或技术生命周期中，最先尝试和接受新产品或服务的一群人）。就像夏奇拉和碧昂丝等等，对吧？如果是男孩，那就更重要了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was like interesting. And she's like and you know what's important that if it's a female that that audience is teen girls because they're the earliest adopters, you know, and Shakira and Beyonce, etc., right? and and if it's boys, it's even more important.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，我刚刚向您描述的，基本上就是那位艺人与曲目部门高管寻找早期艺人并将其培养成明星的系统。从哲学上讲，是什么创造了这种联系？可能是他们的态度，可能是他们的歌词，他们关心的主题。我认为这非常个人化，但它必须存在，它使他们独一无二。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's basically, you know, I just described to you a system that that NR executive has to find uh artists early and build them into stars. And philos and philosophically, what is it that creates that connection? It could be their attitude. It could be uh their lyrics, you know, the topics that they care about. Uh I think it's deeply personal but it's like it's got to be there and it's what makes them unique</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但有趣的是，我刚才描述的，你不能强加给另一个艺人与曲目部门的高管，对吧？每个人都有不同的系统，我只是给您举了一个例子。但这是一个非常成功的年轻人，她发现了一位艺人并拥有一个系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh but the thing that's interesting is like what I just described to you it's not that you can like force this on another ANR executive right people have different systems I'm giving you one but it's like this is a young person who's very very successful and um and then has discovered an artist and has a system</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您认为这种联系是可以学习的吗？艺人可以学习如何建立联系吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">can that connectivity be learned you think can an artist learn to connect uh</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为人们会随着时间的推移尝试。我认为这可能可以学习，但如果你已经拥有它，那么发展你的艺术显然比学习如何建立联系更容易。但我认为这可能需要更多的专注来学习这种联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think I think people try over time. it pro I I think it probably can be but it's uh it's easier to learn like if you have it it's easier to obviously develop your art then learn the connectivity but I think it comes with uh probably increased focus you know to learn that connectivity but uh</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但你知道，这都只是开始，是核心。但接下来我们要做的就是弄清楚如何扩大艺人的受众，而不是立即进入半空的演唱会大场地，而是逐渐发展他们，建立一群将永远支持他们的粉丝。你只需要建立一个核心，所有的一切都将从中成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know this is all like the beginning the nucleus of it right but then what we have to do is figure out okay how do we grow the artist audience and and not go into big concert uh venues immediately that would be half empty, but instead grow them gradually and uh and build up a uh you know group of fans that will be with them forever and from you just need to build a core from which everything grows.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 那么，假设我现在拿着吉他，在某个小镇的酒吧里演奏，罗伯特·金塞尔走了进来，他会说：“嘿，看看那个家伙尼古拉。他与观众的互动很棒。”所以您来找我，但接下来几年您会怎么帮助我呢？您会如何培养我？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's say so let's say now I have my guitar I'm playing in Cton Town, you know, in some kind of uh bar uh Robert Kinsel comes in. It's just like hey look at that guy Nikolai. He's got great uh rapport with the audience. So you come to me and but just what do you do with me the next couple of years you know how do you how do you build it it</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这完全取决于你具体需要什么，这也会有所不同。因为有时艺人也是词曲作者，他们会创作自己的音乐。布鲁诺·马尔斯就是一个例子，他是一位出色的词曲作者，他就是这样开始的，然后他开始演唱自己的音乐。所以最初你可能是一名词曲作者，为别人创作，然后你尝试自己的运气，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all depends like obviously what you need specifically right which also varies because sometimes artists are also songwriters so they write their own music uh you know Bruno Mars was an example of that he's an excellent songwriter and that's how he started and then and then he started to uh sing his music so initially maybe you may be a songwriter and you're writing for other people and then you try your own luck right with that</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这就像是决定哪些歌曲你做，哪些不做，或者与他人合作。所以很多时候，这不仅仅是完善你的声音，还在于与合适的人合作，无论是你合作的词曲作者，还是唱歌方面的合作。所以这完全取决于艺人是谁以及他们需要什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's like you know deciding which ones you do which ones you don't or it's a collaboration with somebody. So so many times it's also about not just about like perfecting your voice but it's also about collaborating with the right people whether it's songwriters that you work with or collaborations from uh from singing perspective. So so it all depends on who the artist is and uh and what they need.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 还有**巡演支持**（Tour support: 唱片公司或管理团队为艺人提供资金、物流和推广支持，帮助他们组织和进行巡回演出），对吧？比如帮助他们安排小型巡演，这有助于他们开始建立**核心粉丝群**（Nucleus of the super super fans: 指艺人最忠实、最投入的一小部分粉丝，他们是艺人长期成功的基石），这些粉丝会永远支持他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh there's tour support, right? Like helping them set up uh small tours that help them start building the nucleus of the super super fans, right? That will be with them. Um you know, all of that's work and you know there's a</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 泰迪·斯威姆斯（Teddy Swims）就是一个很好的例子，他是我们现在的一位明星，五年前他还不是。他与我们一起做了令人难以置信的工作，建立了他的核心受众。他会去欧洲，做小型演出，并逐渐建立起来。我们也会做研究，对吧？我们根据掌握的大量数据来判断他们应该在哪里巡演，应该做什么，重点应该放在哪里。所以，这变成了一种深度合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know really great example with Teddy Swims, you know, one of our, you know, current stars who, you know, five years ago wasn't and he has just done an incredible job uh with us to build up his core audience. he would travel to Europe, do small shows and build it, you know, and and you know, we we do research, right? We look based on a lot of the data that we have. It's like where where they should tour, what they should do, right? Where the focus should be. So, it's like it becomes a deep collaboration.</p>

### 知名艺人的持续影响力与现场音乐的魅力

**Nicolola:** 对于像酷玩乐队这样长期建立的团体，情况有何不同？他们需要什么帮助？为什么他们需要帮助？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is it different when it's a long time established group, let's say Cold Play or you know, one of these, what do they need help? What do why do they need help? Yeah, that's uh I</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我前几天也问了他们同样的问题：为什么你们需要帮助？你看，如果你是一个有抱负的艺人，你想要变得出名和有影响力，对吧？如果你是一个像酷玩乐队这样的超级巨星或乐队，那么你想要保持影响力，对吧？当然，你处于顶峰，你想要确保自己能留在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">asked them the other day the same thing. How why do you need help? And look, the if you're an aspiring artist, you want to become big and relevant, right? If you're a huge uh superstar or band like Coldplay, then you want to remain relevant, right? Of course, you know, so it's like you're at the top of the heap and you want to make sure that you stay there.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 再次强调，在一个日益嘈杂的世界里，对吧？在所有形式的媒体中，尤其是在音乐界，噪音非常大，但在所有领域都很难。所以，你想要确保你正在创作热门歌曲，并且世界各地的人都能听到你的新艺术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, it's in the world that's increasingly noisy, right? and across all forms of media, but in music it's very noisy, but across like everything it's very hard. So, so you want to make sure that you're creating hits and that people around the world hear your new art and you know,</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 比如，我们去年十月与酷玩乐队合作发行了一张新专辑，取得了巨大成功，但我们所有人都很紧张，对吧？每个人都非常努力地工作，以确保它能成功。没有人会因为是酷玩乐队就掉以轻心。实际上，我们反而更紧张，因为我们真的想确保它能兑现承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we just did a new album with co-play in October and it was a great success, but like you know, all of us were nervous, right? And everybody worked extremely hard to make it succeed. Nobody sleeps on their lures just because it's a it's coldplay. it's actually we're that much more nervous because we want to really make sure that it delivers on its promise and um</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，我认为，如果你今天来看，无论发行如何民主化，所有的大明星都与大型音乐公司签约。因为这需要一个“村庄”的力量。如果你追求持续和可重复的成功，这需要一个“村庄”的力量。如果你只是追求一次性的成功，那无关紧要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so I think the you know if you if you look at it today no matter how much distribution has democratized all the big stars are signed with large music companies and um and because it it it takes a village it takes a village again if you're looking for sustained and repeatable success if you're just looking for oneoff thing doesn't matter the</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 演唱会业务似乎发生了变化，变得更加宏大，对吧？阿黛尔（Adele）建造了一个价值1亿美元的临时体育场。许多艺人在温布利体育场演出10晚。我的意思是，泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift）本身就是一个传奇，但酷玩乐队的巡演规模也很大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The concert business seems to have changed and just become, you know, a bit grander in a way, right? So Adele built$und00 million pop-up stadium. Many artists do like 10 nights at Wembley. I mean, Taylor Swift, I guess, is a story in herself, but um yeah, cold play massive tour.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 确实如此。我们应该如何解读这一点？这预示着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. How should we how should we read that? What is it a sign of?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，我认为最初是由于新冠疫情导致的**压抑需求**（Penta demand from COVID: 指在新冠疫情期间，由于限制措施导致消费者需求被压抑，疫情结束后出现报复性增长的现象），对吧？但后来这变成了一种常态。我认为在一个日益数字化的世界里，人们渴望**实体体验**（Physical experiences: 指人们在现实世界中通过感官互动获得的体验，而非虚拟或数字体验）。就是这样，就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think initially there was a penta demand from COVID, right? obviously, but then it's a thing. And uh and I think in a world that's increasingly digital, people crave physical experiences. That's it. It's as simple as that.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 如果音乐装饰你的时间，对吧？它是你人生的配乐。当你有一些喜欢的乐队或艺人，他们在你附近的场地演出时，你就会去，对吧？因为你喜欢那种**集体享受**（Collective enjoyment: 指人们共同体验和分享乐趣，尤其是在现场活动中）。我认为，当你可以享受的时候，显然很多人独自享受音乐，对吧？你健身、骑车、跑步等等，或者只是在家工作。但人们最享受音乐的时候是与他人一起分享的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if if music uh decorates your time, right? It's soundtrack to your life. When you have couple favorite bands or or artists and they're they're playing in a venue near you, you go, right? Because it's like you like the collective enjoyment. I think I think when you can enjoy obviously a lot of people enjoy music by themselves right you're working out biking running whatever uh or even just at home working but when people enjoy it the most is when they're sharing it together w with others and usually they start moving they start dancing right and it just it's like expression of joy so so I think you know live music is here with us to stay and and will be will continue to be very successful</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 通常他们会开始移动，开始跳舞，对吧？这就像是喜悦的表达。所以我认为现场音乐会一直存在，并将继续非常成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and usually they start moving they start dancing right and it just it's like expression of joy so so I think you know live music is here with us to stay and and will be will continue to be very successful</p>

**Nicolola:** 您是个好舞者吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are you a good dancer</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">nope you should ask my My my wife my wife is Dominican which means she's an excellent dancer and uh and she will criticize me all the way till Sunday about my dance moves.</p>

### 流媒体的影响与音乐定价

**Nicolola:** 流媒体概念是如何改变您的工作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How has um streaming uh the streaming concept uh changed what you do?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 流媒体是一种更高效的发行方式，对吧？我之前说过，过去无论是**黑胶唱片**（LPs: Long Playing records, 一种模拟音频记录格式）、**CD**还是**磁带**（Tapes），都有大量的库存。所以，从事库存业务的人都知道，这并不是很有趣，对吧？有退货、破损等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Streaming is more efficient distribution, right? I I spoke about in the past when it was uh you know whether it was LPS or CDs or tapes uh you know there was a lot of inventory, right? So you know that a lot of people who are in the inventory business it's it's not that much fun right like there's returns and breakage and all of that.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 音乐非常**流动**（Fluid: 在此指数字音乐易于传输、复制和分发的特性），它与互联网完美契合。它是一种非常高效的发行方式，它能比以前触达更多的人，并且允许人们以**非点播方式**（Non-demand fashion: 指通过广播等方式被动接收音乐，而非主动选择）收听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So u music is very fluid. It's perfectly aligned with the internet. It's very efficient distribution and what it does is it reaches more people than before and uh and it allows people in a non-demand fashion. Right?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 以前人们可以通过广播听到音乐。你坐在出租车里或餐厅里，就能听到。但现在，人们可以通过**个性化方式**（Personalized way: 指用户可以根据自己的喜好主动选择和定制内容）选择自己想听的音乐，并拥有自己的**播放列表**（Playlist: 用户创建或系统推荐的歌曲集合），这让更多人能够接触到音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People could hear music before through radio. you're sitting in the taxi or in a restaurant and you hear it, but in a way in a personalized way that you can select what you want and personalize it and and have your playlist that is now accessible to a lot more people.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以它促进了业务增长。我认为这当然要归功于丹尼尔（Daniel Ek），他推动Spotify发展了数十年并建立了业务，以及其他公司，比如我们在YouTube、苹果和亚马逊等公司所做的工作。所以全球有很多订阅用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it has grown the business and uh and I think you know obviously credit goes to Daniel for Daniel Ike for uh driving Spotify you know through the decades and building the business as well as others you know what we did at YouTube and and and you know Apple and and uh Amazon etc. So there's a lot of lot of subscribers around the world</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但即使在今天，我们仍然落后于**订阅视频点播**（SVOD: Subscription Video On Demand: 一种视频点播服务模式，用户通过支付订阅费获得无限次观看内容的权利），这是不应该的。所以你可以想象，我们还有很大的**可触达受众**（Addressable audience: 指潜在的、可以被营销或服务触及的消费者群体）可以争取。而且这个差距在美国以外的许多发展中市场更大。所以还有很大的增长空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but still even today we are lagging uh esot subscription video on demand which you know we shouldn't right so you can imagine that there is still a lot more addressable audience for us to take and uh and that gap is even bigger outside United States you know in lots of developing markets so a lot a lot more room to grow</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 音乐很便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">music is cheap</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 不，它可能是消费者能获得的最好的交易。是的，它肯定比X便宜。如果你仔细想想，它比任何东西都便宜，因为它长期以来一直**落后于通货膨胀**（Lagging inflation: 指价格增长速度低于通货膨胀率，导致实际购买力下降）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no it's it's probably the best deal that consumers get in anything. Yeah, it's definitely cheaper than X. Like if you think about it's cheaper than anything because it's been lagging inflation for a very long time.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 为什么它这么便宜？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is it so cheap?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 因为，我不是在批评，在Napster和Kazaa以及所有**文件共享服务**（File sharing services: 允许用户通过互联网共享数字文件的平台，如Napster和Kazaa）之后，音乐产业显然处于低谷。然后流媒体服务出现，推动了增长，但定价从这些服务建立之初就一直保持不变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because uh and I don't mean it as a criticism. It's uh you know the industry post Napster and Kazan and all the file sharing services was obviously uh on its knees and then the streaming services uh came and and drove growth and pricing just remained the same from the time uh any of those services got established.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 尽管可能存在通货膨胀，但没有人提高过价格。但这是一个正确的选择，因为那是**争取新订阅用户**（Hunting for new subscribers: 积极寻找和吸引新的用户或客户）并专注于数量和增长的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nobody has moved price up despite you know whatever inflation there may may have been. But it was the right choice because that was the time to hunt, you know, hunt for new subscribers, right? And just focus on volume and focus on growth.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为现在我们正在进入一个既要**争取**（Hunting: 指积极寻找和吸引新的用户或客户，尤其是在市场渗透率较低的地区）在渗透率很低的地区，继续做我们过去做的事情，同时在渗透率高（也许还没有那么高，但已经很高）的地区，我们也要开始**收割价格**（Harvesting on price: 指在市场渗透率较高或用户忠诚度较高时，通过提高价格来获取更多利润）并提高价格的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think now we're entering the era where it's important to do both hunting in places where the penetration is very very low and continue to do what we've done in the past. But then in territories which are where the penetration is high, maybe not as high as yet, but like high, then we also start harvesting on price, right? And increasing that.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，我认为过去15年奏效的方法不一定完全适用于未来15年，我们只需要在方法上更加**精准聚焦**（Laser focused: 极度专注和精确）和**受众细分**（Audience segmented: 根据不同受众群体的特征和需求进行区分）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so I think you know whatever worked in the past 15 years doesn't have to be applied exactly the same way to the next 15 years and we just uh you know we just need to be a little bit more uh laser focused and audience segmented in our approaches.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 当您说“收割”时，您是指缓慢而谨慎地提高价格，直到刚好低于他们离开的那个点吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you say harvest you mean increase prices slowly and carefully until just below the point just below the point where they live.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 正确，正确。当然，没有人希望那样，对吧？我们不希望那样，**数字服务提供商**（DSPs: Digital Service Providers: 数字服务提供商，如Spotify、Apple Music等）也不希望那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. Correct. Which which of course nobody wants, right? We don't want that. The DSPs don't want it. Uh,</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但我认为重要的是不要采用**一刀切的策略**（One-size-fits-all strategy: 指一种适用于所有情况或所有人的通用方法，缺乏灵活性），这是我们所有人15年来都采用的策略，这对于推动增长是正确的。但现在我们必须有两种策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think it's important to not have a one-sizefits-all strategy, which is what we all had, right, for 15 years, which was the right thing to drive growth. But now we got to have sort of two sizes.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 那么，假设现在音乐对消费者的价值是100。这些钱最终去了哪里？多少给了艺人，多少给了你们公司，多少给了流媒体平台？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's say now uh the value of music to the consumer is 100. Where does the money end up? So, what goes to the artist, what goes to you guys, what goes to streaming?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这完全取决于艺人是谁。我学到的其中一件事就是，有太多不同的情况。公司已经发展了几十年，有音乐目录，也有新发行。有发行协议。所以这个范围非常非常广。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It it all depends on who the artist is. There's so many that's one of the things I learned. There's so many, you know, the company has grown. It's been around for many, many decades. And there, you know, there's cataloges and there's new releases. Uh there are distribution deals. So the spectrum is really, really wide.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我的意思是，想想看，我们拥有来自弗利特伍德、乔妮·米切尔、老鹰乐队等深厚的历史音乐目录，还有戴维，对吧？这些历史性的音乐目录真是令人难以置信。顺便说一句，我的小女儿，她最喜欢的乐队之一就是弗利特伍德·麦克乐队，对吧？她现在22岁，从19岁起就一直是她最喜欢的乐队。这种力量真是令人难以置信。

**Nicolola:** 有趣的是，Aha乐队的一位成员马格纳·弗鲁霍尔门（Magne Furuholmen）建议我问您这个问题。所以，关于那些**经典艺人**（Pedigree artist: 指那些拥有悠久历史、卓越成就和深远影响力的艺人），对吧？

**Nicolola:** 那些老歌正在成为新一代的新热门歌曲，他们不在乎这些歌是什么时候创作的，对吧？所以，关于这个话题，是什么促成了这种兴趣的重新兴起？

<p class="english-text">Yes. Where old songs are becoming new hits for new generations who they don't care when it was made or whatever right. So yes on that topic uh just what uh what have contributed to this renewed interest?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我得说，既然您提到了Aha乐队，我是在一个共产主义国家长大的，边境封闭，没有媒体或言论自由的选择，进口音乐非常少。Aha乐队是我得到的黑胶唱片之一。我想我小时候大概有七张黑胶唱片，Aha就是其中之一。

**Robert:** 所以，你知道《The Sun Always Shines on TV》这首歌。是的，这就像是，顺便说一句，当我说艺术装饰墙壁，音乐装饰时间时，对我来说，Aha乐队装饰了我的时间。我知道我在80年代的捷克斯洛伐克在哪里，以及它当时给我的感受。

<p class="english-text">And um so you know the sun always shines on TV. Yeah. And it's like it's uh you know it's like but by by the way you know when I when I said that art decorates walls and music decorates time for me aa decorated my time and like I know exactly where I was you know in you know in the 80s in in in Czechoslovakia and the you know how it made me feel then.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这种兴趣的重新兴起有不同的方式。一种是，我们与各种平台签订这些**音乐目录授权协议**（Catalog license deals: 指音乐公司将其拥有的歌曲和录音目录授权给其他平台或公司使用，以获取收益）。如果是一个开放平台，有时用户只是为了好玩而使用音乐，他们会用它来制作视频，有时这就会火起来。顺便说一句，弗利特伍德·麦克乐队就是在TikTok上这样火起来的。所以它以一种非常**有机**（Organic way: 指自然发生、非人为干预或刻意推广的方式）的方式发生，对吧？这在以前是不存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the the renewal of interest comes in different ways. one which is uh you know we do these catalog license l licensing deals with all kinds of platforms and then if it's an open platform sometimes users just users for fun take the music and they do something with it and attach it to a video and and sometimes that takes off by the way that's that's how Fleetwood Mac took off you know and u uh on Tik Tok uh so it happens that way in a very very organic way right and this didn't used to be there</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 另一种管理良好的方式是，当现在的艺人想要翻唱一首标志性的歌曲时。大卫·库塔（David Guetta）就是这方面的**大师**（Master: 在某个领域技艺精湛的人），对吧？大卫是我们的艺人之一。他是一位著名的DJ和制作人，他喜欢寻找标志性的歌曲并进行重制。他刚刚与艾娃·马克斯（Ava Max）和阿尔法（Alpha）一起重制了《Forever Young》，这首歌突然就在各地排行榜上名列前茅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the other sort of well-managed ways that this happens is uh when current artists want to remake a song that was iconic. David Gha is like a master at this, right? David got one of one of our artists. He's a famous uh DJ and producer and he he just uh loves to find you know just iconic songs and remake them and and he just he just remade Forever Young right with Ava Max and uh and Alpha and uh you know and it's like suddenly the song is just charting everywhere.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 顺便说一句，我不得不说，过去六到九个月最令人难以置信的故事之一是林肯公园（Linkin Park）。这个乐队在2000年与我们发行了第一张专辑。几年前，他们的主唱去世了。他们经历了寻找替代者的过程。他们去年秋天的复苏是前所未有的。他们新专辑的成功是疯狂的。预售量创下了华纳的历史新高，他们的音乐目录销量也飙升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but by the way, the I I have to I have to say that one of the most incredible stories over the last six to nine months has been Lincoln Park. It's a band that released their first album with us in in the year 2000. A few years ago, their lead singer passed away. They went through replacing uh replacing him. The the resurgence that they had last fall was like unlike anything we've ever seen. The success of their new album was insane. The pre-sales were the highest in Warner's history and and their catalog just shot through the roof.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这是一个与我们合作了25年的乐队。你知道，没有人比他们更值得这样的成功。但当观众在那里时，真是令人难以置信。它会一直存在，不会消失。这再次强调了**知识产权**（IP: Intellectual Property: 知识产权，指人类智力劳动所创造的成果，包括版权、专利、商标等）的价值，无论宏观层面发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is a band that's been with us for 25 years. And and it's just, you know, nobody deserves the success more than these guys. Uh but it's just it's incredible when that audience is there. It stays. It doesn't go away. And uh and it just underscores the value of IP despite whatever happens on a macro level.</p>

### 版权挑战与AI时代

**Nicolola:** 在版权、旧音乐的再利用和混音方面，存在哪些挑战？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the challenges when it comes to copyright um and the reuse and mashups of older music?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 挑战一直存在。随着社交媒体的出现，对吧？YouTube是第一个。所以我实际上很荣幸能早期参与这项工作。这就是我提到埃里克·施密特说“嘿，想办法让他们停止给我们寄纸质文件，而是我们给他们寄纸质文件”的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um the challenges they've always been there uh with the advent of social media, right? And YouTube was the first one. So I actually had the the privilege um of working on that early on. This is like what I referred to when Eric Schmidt said, "Hey, figure out how you stop them from sending us paper." And so we send them paper and um um it's basically how do you track uh you know fragments of copyrights in other copyrighted material or in other videos or audio etc. and how do you aortion the money, you know, and what tools you give.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 基本上，就是如何追踪其他受版权保护材料或视频、音频等中的版权片段，以及如何分配资金，以及提供哪些工具。所以在YouTube早期，我们开发了一个叫做**Content ID**（Content ID: YouTube开发的一种数字指纹系统，用于识别和管理受版权保护的内容）的系统，它允许我们做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so early on at YouTube, we built something called content ID that allowed us to do that. Basically, fingerprint the content and then as people uploaded it to YouTube, we would then be able to sort of parse it out and then have commercial relationships to give the copyright holders the the ability to either block it or track it or monetize it. And then there had to be a commercial split obviously negotiated for for that.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 基本上，就是对内容进行**数字指纹识别**（Fingerprint the content: 指通过算法提取内容的独特特征，生成一个数字“指纹”，以便识别和追踪该内容），然后当人们将其上传到YouTube时，我们就能将其解析出来，然后建立商业关系，让版权所有者可以选择屏蔽、追踪或货币化这些内容。当然，这需要协商商业分成。

<p class="english-text">Basically, fingerprint the content and then as people uploaded it to YouTube, we would then be able to sort of parse it out and then have commercial relationships to give the copyright holders the the ability to either block it or track it or monetize it. And then there had to be a commercial split obviously negotiated for for that.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为这在**人工智能**（AI）时代也会以同样的方式发展，因为它基本上就是**用户生成内容**（UGC: User-Generated Content: 用户生成内容）的“加强版”。所以一切都更快、更大，但我认为我们早在15年前就为如何处理这个问题奠定了非常好的框架，我们可以从中学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's uh you know that's the same thing that will develop in the age of AI because it's basically just UGC on steroids and uh so it's just everything is faster bigger and but uh I think we've laid down a a really good framework uh you know more than 15 years ago for how to do this and we can learn from that.</p>

**Nicolola:** 您希望拥有哪个音乐目录？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the catalog you wish you had?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 越来越多，有太多了。你知道，有些公司拥有所有你没有的音乐目录，你想购买哪一个？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">more more and more there's so much uh you know there there are companies I have all the cataloges you haven't got which one do you want to buy</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，这取决于价格是多少，你收取的倍数是多少。平均来说，你知道，显然有迈克尔·杰克逊（Michael Jackson）和皇后乐队（Queen）这样的标志性音乐。我刚刚提到了两个，我在捷克斯洛伐克“铁幕”后面也拥有他们的黑胶唱片，对吧？所以，你知道，这只是强化了这一点，但你知道，这两个乐队和Aha乐队当时都给我留下了深刻印象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um it depends what the price is what multiple are you charging just average average like you know there's obviously iconic iconic music like Michael Jackson right and queen again it's I just named two where I also had the LPS behind Iron Curtain in Czechoslovakia, right? So, you know, it just kind of enforced that, but you know, uh uh you know, those two stuck with me along with aa back then.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，你知道，我喜欢，是的，我的意思是，那两个我当然会得到。不幸的是，竞争对手拥有它们，但生活就是这样。但我们自己也有一些非常棒的，我为此感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's, you know, I I love uh yeah, I mean those two I would obviously get. Unfortunately, competition has them, but uh such is life, but we have some really amazing ones ourselves which I'm tremendously proud of.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 另一个让我非常自豪的是特蕾西·查普曼（Tracy Chapman），你知道，她的音乐对我来说**标记**（Timestamps: 在此指音乐能够唤起特定人生阶段或回忆的象征意义）了我在美国上大学的那些年，对吧？所以，不同的乐队在不同的时期。一年前在格莱美看到她的表演真是太棒了。是的，很有趣。

**Robert:** 是的，平克·弗洛伊德也是。是的，对我来说，那首歌会把我带回80年代。是的，这有点好笑，因为我们播客有一个片头音乐，我们当时考虑用这首歌，但它太贵了，所以我们自己做了。

### AI对音乐产业的影响

**Nicolola:** 我们刚才提到了AI。它将如何改变您的业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We kind of touched on AI. Um just how how is it going to change your business?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为我们还不完全清楚。但我们非常关注它。我认为它可能以两种不同的方式发生。一种就像其他任何业务一样，你用它来提高效率，对吧？所以这与音乐无关，它只是标准的实践，标准化我们的工作流程，这样你就可以自动化很多这些，并通过应用AI来实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think we know yet exactly. U but um we're very focused on it. I think there's two different ways uh that it can happen. One just like for any other business where you use it for efficiency, right? So it's like that's got nothing to do with music, right? is just like uh you know standard practices and sort of standardizing our workflows so that you can then you know automate a lot of those and and um um you know through application of uh AI.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 另一种是音乐特有的，就是我们讨论过的，如何追踪和归属。但另一种也是创作，对吧？现在已经存在创作者工具，未来会有更多，无论是开源还是闭源的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other which is music specific is uh for what we discussed which is how do you track and attribute but the other is also creation right and um there's obviously uh creator tools that exist today there'll be more in the future whether open source or closed source and and I think they'll ultimately have two separate two types of outputs</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我认为它们最终会有两种不同的产出。一种是我称之为**背景音乐**（Background music: 指在不吸引主要注意力的前提下，为环境或活动提供氛围的音乐），它不与任何艺人相关联，更像是**情绪音乐**（Mood music: 旨在营造特定氛围或情绪的音乐）。我认为AI可能会占据很大一部分市场，因为它更容易大规模制作，可能更精准等等。所以我认为这可能是音乐领域中可能受到冲击的一个领域。这很清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one which is what I would call more like background music that it's not like associated with any artist it's more like mood music and and I think AI will probably take a big chunk out of that because you know it will be easier to do it at larger scale probably more you know better precision etc. So I would say that may be an area of music that may be under attack. Pretty that's that's pretty clear.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 另一种是以**艺人为中心**（Artist-centric: 指以艺人及其身份和作品为核心）的音乐。当您说情绪音乐时，那是什么样的？像日落音乐吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other is artistcentric music and that's when I'm so when you say mood when you say moodcentric music what is that like sundown?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 是的，就像我听的时候不知道艺人是谁。它更像是我工作时在背景播放的音乐。**电梯音乐**（Elevator music: 指在公共场所播放的轻柔、不引人注目的背景音乐）。你知道，它没有任何明确的艺人关联。是的，或者声音。有时它甚至没有声音，但有时，你知道，很多时候它有，但它没有与任何艺人品牌关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it's yeah like I'm I'm not thinking like when I listen to it I have no idea who the artist is. It's more like I'm working and it's just something playing in the background. Elevator music. uh you know it's just it doesn't have any clear artist association. Yeah. Or voice. Sometimes it doesn't even have a voice but sometime you know many times it does but it's it's not it's not branded with any artist.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这就是为什么我用“以艺人为中心”来形容另一类音乐，比如艾德·希兰（Ed Sheeran）的音乐，或者与艾德·希兰的音乐非常相似的作品，或者布鲁诺·马尔斯（Bruno Mars）、杜瓦·利帕（Dua Lipa）等等。我认为这种类型的内容，我们必须极其谨慎地处理，因为它显然关乎人们的身份和生计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and that's why I'm using the words artistentric for the other bucket which is like you know it's this this is either a sheiran or it's substantially similar to aan right or Bruno Mars or dualipa etc. And I think this type of content will uh we have to handle extremely carefully because it's obviously people's identity and their livelihood.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 没错。但非常重要的是他们的身份。在这里，它需要非常基于许可，无论他们是否希望被复制，以及是他们现有的歌曲还是全新的歌曲。但这是我们非常关注的领域，我们在这方面的工作涉及三个方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. But like very importantly their identity and and uh and here it needs to be very permission based whether they want to to be sort of duplicated or not and whether it's their existing songs or completely new songs. But this is the area where we're really focused a lot and our our work on this is in with three constituents.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 第一是平台本身，因为内容最终会出现在那里，对吧？所以我们如何处理这些内容。第二是与模型公司合作，第三是与政府合作。按照这个优先级顺序，因为显然与政府合作处理像**AI反假冒法案**（AI No Fakes Act: 旨在打击利用人工智能生成虚假内容，特别是深度伪造的立法）这样的事情很重要。但有时它需要很长时间才能真正实现，对吧？这并不意味着我们不做，但我们不依赖它。所以这是一项多方面的努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One which is the platforms themselves because that's where the content ends up right. So how we treat that the second is with the with the uh model companies and the third one is with governments sort of and in this order in that ascending order of priority because obviously with government it's important to work on things like uh uh AI um um no fakes act etc. But sometimes it takes a long time for it to actually come to fruition, right? Doesn't mean we don't do it, but we don't rely on. So it's uh it's a multi multifront uh work.</p>

### 华纳音乐集团的企业文化与领导哲学

**Nicolola:** 罗伯特，我们换个话题。华纳音乐集团的企业文化是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robert, let's uh change tack a bit. What's the corporate culture like at Warner Music Group?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我有点把它称为一个价值150亿、160亿、170亿、180亿美元的**初创公司**（Startup: 指一家新成立的、通常具有创新商业模式和高速增长潜力的公司），这取决于我们的**市值**（Market cap: Market capitalization: 市值，指一家上市公司所有流通股的总价值）。因为你知道，你希望尽可能地保留这种**创业精神**（Entrepreneurial: 具有创业精神的，指敢于创新、承担风险、追求增长的特质）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a I kind of call it a um 15 depending on our market cap is 15 16 17 18 billion startup. uh because you know you you want to retain that right as much as possible to have the entrepreneurial uh feeling at the same time we're public company which means lots of reporting and stability and visibility etc.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 同时，我们是一家**上市公司**（Public company: 指其股票在证券交易所公开交易的公司，需要遵守严格的披露和报告规定），这意味着大量的**报告**（Reporting: 定期向公众和监管机构披露财务和运营信息）、**稳定性**（Stability: 业务或市场状况的稳定状态）和**透明度**（Visibility: 公司运营和财务状况的透明度）。所以我一直在努力平衡这两种感觉：我希望像初创公司一样快速行动和颠覆事物，同时又必须在某些结构内运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm I'm constantly sort of juggling these two feelings that I want to move fast and disrupt things fast as a startup and at the same time I got to operate within within uh you know certain structures.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我会说它非常**有创业精神**（Entrepreneurial: 具有创业精神的，指敢于创新、承担风险、追求增长的特质）。而且你必须这样做。我认为最好的方法是，作为领导者，你需要决定哪些角色可以是创业型的，哪些角色需要更加结构化，对吧？因为这才是真正的管理方式，你不能把所有相同的东西应用到每个人身上，我认为那是一个错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I would say it's very entrepreneurial. Um and and you kind of have to I think the the best way to tackle it is then you need to decide as a leader which roles can be entrepreneurial and which ones need to be much more structured, right? Because that's really the way to to manage because you can't apply all the same to everybody and uh I think that's a mistake.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，这就是我正在摸索和感受的方式。显然，越接近前线，越接近艺人，你越希望他们具有创业精神。越是**右脑型**（Right brain: 指创造性、直觉和情感思维）的人，你越希望他们具有创业精神。越是**左脑型**（Left brain: 指逻辑性、分析性和结构化思维）的人，越接近公司中心，就越需要结构化。然后你就可以拥有一个全球平台，释放那些有创意的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um so that's that's what I'm feeling through and feeling my way through and obviously the closer they are to front line to the artist you want them to be entrepreneurial and the closer so the more right brain right the more entrepreneurial you want them to be and the more left brain the closer to the center of the company the more structure and then you can have like a glo global platform that unleashes the creative people.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 在同一家公司中拥有左脑和右脑的挑战是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the challenges of having the left and the right brain in the same company?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 这就是把它们结合在一起的乐趣，因为我认为在我们的领域里，没有两者兼备的公司是无法成功的。它行不通，因为如果只有右脑，它会太小，无法充分扩展。如果只有左脑，它会失去所有的创造力和交易流等等。所以，你需要找到如何将它们连接起来的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the fun of putting that together because I don't think that you can have a successful uh company in our space that doesn't have both. It doesn't work because if it's only right, it's going to be too small. It's not going to scale enough. And if it's going to be only left, it's going to lose all the creativity and and and deal flow, etc. So, so you need to you need to find how to bridge it together.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 然后你也会意识到，当人们花更多时间在一起时，他们并没有那么不同。我以前在YouTube工作时总是说，工程师就像词曲作者。他们都编写软件。只是一个是讲故事的软件，另一个是实用工具软件，对吧？一个是代码，另一个是音符，但他们都在编写可以在全球传播的数字内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you also realize that when people spend more time together, uh, that they're not that different. I I always used to say, you know, when I was working at YouTube is that engineers are like songwriters. They both write software. It's just one is storytelling software and the other one is like utility software, right? One is code and the other one is notes, but they're writing something that's digitally disseminated throughout the world.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 他们的行为方式也差不多。你知道，明星工程师可能很**古怪**（Peculiar: 指行为或性格异于常人，有点独特或奇怪），就像明星词曲作者或艺人一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they kind of behave the same way. You know, uh star engineers are uh you know, they can be peculiar just like star songwriters or artists.</p>

**Robert:** 不，我们没有。你知道，我当然会和公司举行**全体员工会议**（All hands meetings: 指公司所有员工参加的会议，通常由高层领导主持，分享公司最新动态和战略），但这并不算非常规。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one is an open mind. I think it's extremely important because we live in a world full of uncertainty and actually increasing uncertainty</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 在这种情况下，能见度有限，你需要那些必要时能**迅速调整**（Pivot on a dime: 指能够快速灵活地改变方向、策略或观点）并拥有非常开放的心态来重新思考事物的人。我总是喜欢颠覆，对吧？如果你看看我的职业选择，我总是在颠覆一些东西。

Uh I've always look I always like disrupting right like if you look at it from my choices of employment I was I was always disrupting something and uh</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以我很难静止不动，只是成为一个不变事物的一部分。我就是那样的人。所以我喜欢雇用那些内心有这种特质的人，因为那显然也让我的工作更容易，对吧？通过拥有许多**变革者**（Change makers: 指那些积极推动变革、创新和进步的人）。所以，具有非常开放心态的变革者，因为当你拥有开放的心态时，尤其是在我们这样的公司或任何其他大型跨国公司工作时，你最终会进入**矩阵式组织**（Matrix setup: 一种组织结构，员工同时向职能经理和项目经理汇报，形成网状管理）。

<p class="english-text">uh they would probably say so uh um you know I I I I actually work with our head of HR quite a lot u because a lot of these things tie to you know uh what you know HR processes are and how certain things are set up and u</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 此外，我还与我们的传播主管合作，因为我学到的一件事是，你可以做各种不同的事情，但如果人们不知道，如果信息没有传达出去，如果它没有引起共鸣，如果人们没有参与进来，最终它就无法奏效，对吧？你就什么也完成不了。所以，围绕沟通的协作变得更加具有战略意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and also uh with our head of comms because one of the things that I learned is that you can do what you know all the different things but if people don't know it if the message doesn't translate if it doesn't resonate you don't have people on board ultimately it doesn't work right then and you don't accomplish anything so uh you know having having the collaboration uh uh around communications becomes much much more strategic</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您如何在内部进行沟通？如何让人们积极向上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you communicate internally how do you get people to climb the mountains</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 通过全体员工会议，对吧？而且，这不仅仅是我一个人，我当然会包括领导团队的其他同事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so a all hands meetings right uh and and again those it's not just me right obviously I include other colleagues from the leadership team.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您多久举行一次？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How often how often do you do them?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我们每六个月举行一次。嗯，我们拭目以待。你知道，在我之前的工作中，我们每季度举行一次。我不想马上就让大家负担过重。我们有很多事情要做，有很多变化。但现在我们每六个月举行一次。嗯，它能把公司凝聚在一起，这很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we do it every six months and u and we'll see you know if I didn't want to uh uh in my previous job we did it every quarter. Uh I didn't want to overload it right away. We have a lot of things to do, lots of lots of change. But now we're doing it every six months. Uh and um but you know brings the company together which is important.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我每周五做的一件事是，我基本上会在一个**Slack频道**（Slack channel: Slack是一款团队协作工具，其频道用于特定主题或团队的沟通）上发布我这周读到的东西。所以它不会垃圾邮件式地发送给整个公司。只有那些想关注的人才会看到，而且人数还不少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the thing that I do every week on Friday is um I I publish basically what I read this week on a slack channel. So it's not spamming the whole company. It's only people who want to follow that and uh which is quite a lot</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但我发现这很有帮助，因为我每天至少花一个小时阅读大量新闻，无论是政治新闻、娱乐新闻还是商业新闻。所以，我基本上会收集一些值得注意的故事，然后分享它们，而不是我读过的所有东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's I I find it helpful because I read a lot of news uh whether it's political news or entertainment news or business news just every day at least an hour of that. So, so I basically collect not everything that I've read but basically a bunch of notable stories and then I share them.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您读哪些类型的东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What kind of things do you read?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 嗯，我的意思是，我有一个**头条新闻简报**（Headlines newsletter: 一种定期发送的电子邮件或在线出版物，提供新闻头条和摘要），我从一个人那里收到，他每天给我大约100条关于不同重要主题的头条新闻。所以这是我吸收世界上正在发生的一切最**简洁**（Succinct: 简明扼要，不冗长）的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I mean a there there's a there's an uh uh headlines u headlines uh newsletter that I get uh from one person that gives me like probably 100 headlines every single day on different important topics. So that's like my most succinct way to absorb everything that's happening uh in the world right now.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 他叫什么名字？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who is it called?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 他叫艾比（Abe）。是艾比·伯恩斯（Abe Burns）吗？我忘了。好的，我稍后会告诉您。它非常有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's uh his name is Abe. Is it Abe Burns? I forget. Right. I'll I I'll get it back to I'll get back to you on that. And uh but it's extremely useful and um</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 然后，你知道，我读《华尔街日报》（Wall Street Journal）、彭博社（Bloomberg）、《金融时报》（FT）、《纽约时报》（New York Times）等等。我读所有这些。然后我还会浏览苹果新闻（Apple News），因为那样你就可以打开一大堆其他的，它超越了商业范畴，更深入到普通生活等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then uh you know I read Wall Street Journal uh you know all of the publication Bloomberg, FD uh New York Times etc. So I read all of those. uh then I go through uh Apple News because then you rope open a whole bunch of other one it goes beyond business right so it's more into like general life etc</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 然后我订阅了许多不同的新闻简报，比如本·汤普森（Ben Thompson）的《Strategery》等等。我阅读所有这些与华纳音乐无关的主题，只是为了让自己更聪明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I have lots of different newsletters uh that I subscribe to like strategery etc Ben Thompson um you know and just read all of that on topics that have nothing to do with Warner right uh but just to be generally smarter</p>

### 驱动力与给年轻人的建议

**Nicolola:** 如果您要将其提炼出来，每天是什么驱动着您与这些令人惊叹的创意力量，比如艺人和词曲作者一起工作？对我来说，我工作中最喜欢的部分就是见到他们。当您与他们合作时，是什么驱动着您？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you were to distill it down what is driving you each day when you work with uh amazing creative force, you know, artists and songwriters. And for me, the favorite part of my job is meeting them. Uh when you when you work with them, what drives you is that you want to figure out the best way that we can help them unleash their art on the world.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 是的，您想要找出我们能帮助他们将艺术带给世界的最佳方式。这很有趣，对吧？因为当你看到这一切发生，当你看到那**蓝色火焰**（Blue flame: 比喻艺术家的天赋、激情和潜力）变得越来越大，直到它真正燃烧起来时，那真是令人难以置信。为了做到这一点，你不能坐以待毙，必须颠覆公司本身，对吧？因为这个行业正在变化，这也很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's kind of fun, right? Because when you see that happening and when you see the blue flame then getting bigger and you know until it's like really flaming uh it's it's incredible and in order to do that you you have to not sit still and disrupt the company itself right because the industry is changing and that's also cool.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以对我来说，这是持续的进化和塑造未来的能力。再次强调，这是**颠覆**（Disruption: 指通过引入创新产品、服务或商业模式来彻底改变现有市场或行业）。是的，我想用一个词来形容就是颠覆，对吧？因为我认为通过颠覆，你会发现机会，它会让你更强大、更聪明，你不能害怕它。是的，我就是不喜欢坐以待毙，所以这份工作让我能够做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like for me it's the it's the constant evolution and the ability to shape things for the future again you know it's disruption it's uh yeah I guess I in one word it's disruption right because I think through disruption you find opportunity it makes you stronger smarter and you can't be afraid of it and uh yeah I just don't like to s sit still and so this job allows me to do that</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 当您不得不静止不动时，您如何放松？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and when you have to sit still how do you relax</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 我不怎么放松，通过阅读新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't really by reading news uh</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 但不，我实际上很喜欢看电视。那是我完全放松的最喜欢的方式。我是一个**狂热的**（Voracious: 指对某事物有极大的兴趣或胃口）电影和电视节目观众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh no, I like watching TV a lot actually. Uh that's like my my favorite way to completely disconnect. Um I'm yeah voracious uh watcher of movies and TV shows and a lot</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 比如哪些？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">such as such as</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 比如《白莲花度假村》（White Lotus）、《狮子座》（Lioness）。你知道，我喜欢Paramount Plus上的很多节目，所有泰勒·谢里丹（Taylor Sheridan）的节目，比如《黄石》（Yellowstone）。所以我喜欢那些。HBO的《镀金时代》（Gilded Age）也很有趣。但你知道，显然《白莲花度假村》很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">White Lotus, uh Lionus, you know, I love a lot of stuff that's on Paramount Plus, all the Taylor Sheridan shows, you know, Yellowstone and so I love that. uh you know, Gilded Gilded Age on HBO was fun. Uh but you know, obviously uh White Lotus is great.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 还有Netflix的《黑镜》（Black Mirror），很棒。Apple TV Plus的《神之水滴》（Drops of God），令人难以置信的节目。还有太多了。苹果的《新风貌》（The New Look），令人难以置信。所以有太多很棒的节目可以看。是的，那是我完全放松的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh you know, um Black Mirror on Netflix, amazing. Drops of God on Apple TV Plus. Incredible show. There's just so much. Uh The New Look on on Apple, incredible. So there's just there's just so much great stuff to watch and um yeah, so that's that's that's a way for me to completely disconnect.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 我们的播客有成千上万的年轻听众。您对他们有什么建议？您对您的两个女儿说过什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have 10 thou tens of thousands of uh young listeners uh to this podcast. What what's your advice to them? What is it that you have told your two daughters?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 基本上和我父亲告诉我的差不多，那就是没有人会记得你失败的原因。他们只会记得你的**排名**（Ranking: 指在竞争或评估中的位置或等级）或结果是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sort of the same thing that my dad told me which was, you know, nobody will remember the reasons why you failed. They'll just remember your ranking or whatever the result is.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 你知道，只管专注于取得成果，并且永远要**领先你的老板两步**（Stay two steps ahead of your boss: 指在工作中预判老板的需求和问题，并提前做好准备，展现主动性和前瞻性）。这是我在30年前第一份工作中学到的，当时我是一名助理，我的老板告诉我：“领先我两步，你就会是赢家。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know just focus on driving results and always always do stay two steps ahead of your boss. That's I learned it on one of my first jobs uh 30 years ago uh when I was an assistant where my boss told me be two steps ahead of me and you'll be a winner.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 当然，“两步”意味着，你知道，有一个决策树，但它真的伴随我至今。我就是这样思考问题的，因为它能让你在事情考虑得更周全时，与人**快速迭代**（Iterate very quickly: 指快速重复某个过程或任务，以逐步改进和完善）。它不必非常精确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, of course, of course, there's two steps means like, you know, there's a tree, right, of decisions, but it literally stays with me to this day. That's how I think about things because it allows you to iterate very quickly with people when things are thought out a little bit more. And it doesn't have to be precise.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 您如何领先您的老板两步？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you stay two steps ahead of your boss?</p>
</details>

**Robert:** **预判**（Anticipation: 指预测或预料未来可能发生的事情或需求）。你预判回答完第一个问题后，下一个问题会是什么，对吧？你以这种或那种方式回答了。所以，你可能有四种情景，但你只是仔细思考，所以你做好了准备。正因为如此，你会有更**动态的对话**（Dynamic conversation: 指对话内容丰富、互动性强、能够快速推进），而不是“哦，我得回头再联系你”等等。你进步了，而且进步更快。所以我认为这非常非常重要。它一直伴随着我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anticipation. You you anticipate what is the next question after you've answered the first one, right? And and you've answered it this way or that way. And then so like you got you know maybe four scenarios but like you just kind of think it through so you prepare it and and because of that you kind of have much more dynamic conversation versus oh I have to get back to you and this and that. Like you you you progress and you make faster progress. So I think that's really really important. It stayed with me.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 老实说，我二十多岁时学到了这一点，它一直伴随我至今。而且，你知道，我对我女儿们说，这听起来可能不太好听，但当你说“我尽力了”，如果结果不好，那意味着你没有更多的**上升空间**（Upside: 指未来可能获得的潜在收益或进步空间），对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Honestly I learned that in my late 20s and it stayed with me to this day. And uh and and you know the I say this to my daughters. I mean this might not sound that nice but when you say I'm doing my best if the result isn't good it means there's no more upside from you right</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 所以，你知道，在你这么说之前应该考虑一下，对吧？你正在尽力。嗯，你知道，所以有几件事是这样的。我认为我内心的**移民心态**（Immigrant mentality: 指移民群体通常具有的勤奋、坚韧、渴望成功和超越自我的特质）是，我总是觉得，因为我有口音。我有一个口音。我总是觉得它可能会以某种方式阻碍我。所以，我必须做得更多。你知道，我没有**人脉**（Connections: 指社会关系或网络）。我当时想，我必须比美国人做得更多才能获得同样的成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know should think about that before you say that right that you're doing your best and um um you know so it's uh there there are a few things like this and and I think the you know the immigrant mentality in me is I always felt because I have an accent. I was in an accent. I always felt like it probably holds me back somehow. So, I have to do more in know, you know, I don't have connections. I was like, I have to do more than the Americans in order to get the same.</p>
</details>

**Robert:** 当你这样做时，它会以某种方式伴随着你，然后你总是会做得更多，总是。所以，我认为**超越他人**（Outrun the other people: 比喻在竞争中表现更出色，超越对手）是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh when you do that, somehow it sticks stays with you and then you always just end up doing more always. And um so I think it's it's good to outrun the other people.</p>
</details>

**Nicolola:** 罗伯特，我只能说，您的移民口音似乎并没有太多地阻碍您。与您交谈真是太棒了。多么有趣的公司。多么令人难以置信的世界。非常感谢您用这些美妙的音乐为我们的时代增添色彩，让生活充满乐趣。

<details>

What an incredible what an incredible world and uh big thanks for coloring our times with this incredible music and for making life so much fun.</p>

**Robert:** 谢谢。我们为公司感到非常自豪。我们热爱我们所做的事情，而且我们正在颠覆自己，努力为世界各地的艺人、词曲作者和用户提供更大的价值，并成为我们发行合作伙伴的好伙伴。
