### 意识的奥秘：从麻醉中醒来

就在一年多前，我生平第三次停止了存在。我当时正在接受一个小手术，我的大脑被**麻醉剂**（Anesthetic: 用于暂时阻断疼痛感或意识的药物）充满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just over a year ago, for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation. My brain was filling with anesthetic.</p>
</details>

我记得一种超脱、瓦解和冰冷的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart and coldness.</p>
</details>

然后我回来了，昏昏沉沉，迷失方向，但肯定还在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I was back drowsy and disoriented, but but definitely there.</p>
</details>

当你从深度睡眠中醒来时，你可能会对时间感到困惑，或者担心睡过头，但总有一种基本的时间流逝感，一种过去与现在的连续性。而从麻醉中苏醒则非常不同。我可能昏迷了五分钟、五小时、五年，甚至五十年。我根本就不在那里。那是一片完全的虚无。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. And coming around from anesthesia is very different. I could have been under for five minutes, five hours, five years, or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. Was total oblivion.</p>
</details>

麻醉，它是一种现代的魔术。它把人变成物体，然后我们希望他们再次变回人。在这个过程中，蕴含着科学和哲学中最大的未解之谜之一：**意识**（Consciousness: 存在、感知和自我感知的状态）是如何产生的？不知何故，在我们每个人的大脑中，数十亿**神经元**（Neurons: 构成神经系统的基本单位，负责传递电信号）的综合活动，每一个都是一个微小的生物机器，正在产生一种有意识的体验。而且不仅仅是任何有意识的体验，而是你此时此刻的有意识的体验。这是如何发生的？回答这个问题之所以如此重要，是因为对我们每个人来说，意识就是一切。没有它，就没有世界，没有自我，什么都没有。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Anesthesia, it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects and then we hope back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow within each of our brains, the combined activity of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience, your conscious experience right here and right now. How does this happen? Well, answering this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is. Without it, there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 大家好，我是阿尼尔·塞斯，萨塞克斯大学的神经科学教授，也是《成为你：意识的新科学》（Being You: A New Science of Consciousness）一书的作者。我给你的第一个问题是，对于一个过着日常生活的普通人来说，为什么思考意识很重要？它为什么重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, I'm Annil Seth. I'm a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex and the author of the book Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. The first question that I have for you is for a regular person just going about their day-to-day. Why is it important to think about consciousness? Why does it matter?</p>
</details>

### 意识的重要性与主观体验

Anil Seth: 把它视为理所当然真的很容易，不是吗？我的意思是，我们就是我们，世界就是它本来的样子，我们过着日常生活。但我认为，如果你稍加反思，并真正思考一下，孩子们在这方面做得很好，因为我记得小时候第一次对意识产生兴趣。我想我们很多人都是这样，比如“我为什么是我而不是别人？”这样的问题。我死后会发生什么？但这种反思的时刻表明，我认为它清楚地表明，对我们来说重要的一切都通过意识体验的媒介而变得重要。你知道，我们感觉好，我们感觉坏，我们看到美好的事物，我们看到丑陋的事物，呃，如果没有体验世界和自我，一切都真的无关紧要。所以我想这是一个核心概念。它是作为人类生存的核心方面。还有很多其他原因说明它为什么重要。还有很多其他实际应用，而且它不仅仅是哲学的领域。它在我们的日常生活中很重要。我认为这从根本上解释了我们为什么应该对它感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really easy to take it for granted, isn't it? I mean, we we just are who we are and the world is how it is and we get on with our daily lives. But I think if you just reflect on it for a little bit and actually think children are very good at this cuz I remember first getting interested in consciousness as a child. I think as many of us are like why am I me and not somebody else? Questions like that. What happens when I die? But this moment of reflection suggests I think makes it clear that everything that matters to us matters through the medium of conscious experience. You know we feel good, we feel bad, we see something beautiful, we see something ugly, we uh without experiencing the world and the self, nothing really matters at all. So I think it's it's a central um concept. It's a central aspect of what it means to be a living human being. There are plenty of other reasons why why it's important. Plenty of other practical applications and you it's not just the realm of of philosophy. It it matters in our daily lives. I think that's fundamentally why we should be interested in it. </p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我非常欣赏你的作品的一点是，你如何将真正宏大复杂的想法，你没有过度简化它们，但你确实让它们变得易于理解。所以，当我们进行这次对话时，我认为它将触及许多关于意识和有意识体验的宏大复杂想法。让我们从我在你的书中发现的，以及在思考这些想法时，最简单、最具体、最直接的例子之一开始，那就是思考颜色，对吧？我们对比如红色或绿色的颜色有意识的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the uh the many things that I admire about your work is how you take really big complex ideas and you don't um oversimplify them but you do make them accessible. Um and so as we are going to have this conversation that I think is going to touch on a lot of of of big complex ideas about consciousness and conscious experience. Let's actually get started with what I found in your book and in just thinking about these ideas to be one of the easiest most concrete immediate examples which is to think about color, right? That we have a conscious experience of say the color red or the color green.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我们都认为我们理解那是什么。然而，很可能，事实上，很有可能其他人对这些完全相同颜色的感知与我们不完全相同。他们的世界体验，他们的意识体验与我们不相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we all think that we understand what that is. And yet it's possible, in fact, it's quite likely that other people's perception of those exact same colors is not the exact same as ours. that their experience of the world, their conscious experience is not the same as ours.</p>
</details>

### 颜色感知：大脑的“控制性幻觉”

Anil Seth: 嗯，我认为这不仅可能，它就是事实。我想有这样一个例子。你还记得吗，克里斯？我不知道听众是否会记得，但大约十年前，有一张裙子的照片，一半人看到的是黄白色，另一半人看到的是蓝黑色。这是一个非常清晰的例子，说明你可以有完全相同的刺激，相同的图像，但我们却可以有非常不同的主观体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think it's not only likely, it just is the case. There's that example, I think. Um, do you remember it, Chris? I don't know if people listening to this will, but about 10 years ago, there was this photo of a dress that half the world saw as yellow and white and the other half saw us as blue and black. And that's a very clear example of how you can have exact the same exact stimulus, the same image, uh, but we can have a very different subjective experience.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我认为颜色是一个很好的例子，它让我们进入了意识的整个问题以及它为何重要，因为，正如你所说，我们把它视为理所当然。我们走在世界上，事物是红色的，或者事物是绿色的，天空是蓝色的。它们独立于我们而存在于世界上。但我们知道那不是真的。这甚至在神经科学真正开始之前，从物理学角度我们就知道，**电磁波谱**（Electromagnetic Spectrum: 各种电磁辐射的总称，包括无线电波、可见光、X射线等）从非常长的无线电波一直延伸到非常短的X射线、伽马射线。而这个所谓的可见光谱位于中间。它是现实中一个薄薄的切片。更重要的是，在这个薄薄的现实切片中，我们只有对大约三种不同波长敏感的细胞。我们称它们为红色、绿色和蓝色，但它们实际上并没有颜色。它们只是电磁辐射的三种波长。而大脑从这三种波长中，变幻出数百万种不同的颜色。所以颜色根本不像它看起来那样存在于世界上。但它也不是凭空捏造的。你知道，那些详细研究这些东西的人认为，我们体验到的颜色是不同表面以不同方式反射光线的一种属性。这就是为什么颜色对我们有用，因为它帮助我们在光照条件变化和事物变化时追踪物体。这对我们的视觉系统来说是非常有用的能力。但它不是对客观现实中存在的事物的直接转导。它需要大脑和世界才能体验颜色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think color is an excellent example that gets us into this whole issue of of consciousness and why it's important because, as you said, it's it we take it for granted. We're we walk around the world and things are red or things are green, the sky is blue. exist that out there in the world independently of us. But we know that's not true. And this is even before neuroscience gets going really from physics. We know that the electromagnetic spectrum uh goes all the way from radio waves which are very long um to x-rays, gamma rays which are really short. And this so-called visible spectrum is somewhere in the middle. It's a thin slice of reality. And what's more, within that thin slice of reality, we just have uh cells that are sensitive to more or less three different wavelengths. We call them red, green, and blue, but they're not actually colored. They're just three wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. And out of those three wavelengths, the brain conjures up in millions of different colors. So it's color just is not there out there in the world in the way that it seems. But it's also not made up. You know what's happening as far as people who study this stuff in in detail uh think is that what we experience as color is a sort of property of how different surfaces reflect light in in different ways. And that's why color is useful for us because it helps us keep track of objects when lighting conditions change and when things change. It's very useful thing for our visual systems to be able to do. But it's not this direct transduction of something that exists in objective reality. It requires a brain and a world to experience color.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我认为颜色之所以是一个有趣的起点，另一个原因是因为我个人的经验是，我是一个色盲。所以我很难区分某些颜色，而许多其他人觉得这些颜色非常明显地不同。所以对我来说，我对世界的体验不包括薰衣草色和浅蓝色之间这条清晰的界线。某些类型的绿色和棕色对我来说更像是一个光谱。所以，而不是像它们之间有清晰的区别。每当人们发现我是色盲时，就会发生一件事，我们就会玩这个游戏。这就像是不可避免的。这并不困扰我。我知道它困扰着一些其他色盲的人，但是我们最终会玩这个游戏，他们会指着我们周围的所有东西说：“那是什么颜色？那是什么颜色？那是什么颜色？这看起来像什么？”他们惊讶地发现，对我来说，它并不总是和他们一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the other reasons why I think color is such an interesting place to start is because my personal experience here is I am color blind. And so I struggle to differentiate between colors certain colors that many other people feel are very clearly different. So to me my experience of the world does not include this bright line between say lavender and light blue. Um certain types of green and brown are are more on a spectrum to me. And so um rather than like there's a there's a a clear difference between them. And one of the things that happens whenever people find out that I'm color blind is we play this game. It's it's like unavoidable. And it doesn't bother me. I know it bothers some other color blind people, but um we end up playing this game where they point at all the things around us and they say, "And what color is that? And what color is that? And what color is that? And what does this look like?" and they're amazed that it's not always the same for me as it is for them.</p>
</details>

Chris: 我的意思是，大多数人，最常见的色盲形式，看看这是否与你产生共鸣，就是非色盲的人会说是红色，然后说是绿色。患有最常见色盲形式的人会认为这些东西大致相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, mo most people uh the most common form of color blindness and see if this resonates with you is is when what non-colorblind people would say is red and then say is green. Uh people with the most common form of color blindness would perceive those things as being, you know, roughly the same.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 是的，这是红绿色盲。我不会说那个例子在我的日常生活中最常出现。它往往是蓝色和薰衣草色，这是经常出现的一个，我很难分辨出区别。比如说一件衬衫的颜色。或者网上时不时会有一些照片会走红，比如世界在红绿色盲患者眼中是什么样子。会有两张照片，据说对于没有这种色盲的人来说，它们看起来非常不同。而对我来说，这些照片看起来完全一样。我无法告诉你哪一张是被修改过的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, it's a red green color blindness. I don't I will say that that doesn't that example is not what plays out the most in my everyday life. It tends to be the blue and lavender are that's the one that comes up a lot where it's very hard for me to tell the difference. Say the color of a shirt. Um or there are these photos online every once in a while there'll be these photos that kind of go viral which is like how the world looks to someone with red green color blindness. And it'll be two photos that I'm told to someone who does not have this look very different. And to me, those photos look exactly the same. I could not tell you which one is the altered one.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 你知道，哲学家托马斯·内格尔（Thomas Nagel）多年前，实际上是五十年前，写了一篇精彩的论文，题为《做一只蝙蝠是什么感觉？》（"What is it like to be a bat?"）。我不是说色盲就像做一只蝙蝠。不。但他的观点是，你知道，对我们每个人来说，我们都有自己的主观世界，那是我们独有的。你知道，每个人的世界都会不同。蝙蝠的主观世界会非常不同，因为它们有**回声定位**（Echolocation: 通过发出声波并接收回声来感知环境的能力）和所有其他东西。而色盲患者的主观世界在颜色方面也会有所不同。上周或前一周，有一项惊人的新实验发表，我想它在美国有一个实验室，他们使用激光来刺激**视网膜**（Retina: 眼睛后部感光细胞所在的膜）中的一类细胞，这些细胞通常不会自行激活。他们声称他们创造了一种前所未有的全新颜色。当然，然后他们试图描述它，这很有趣，比如你如何描述一种据称从未被见过的颜色？你知道，语言几乎必然会失效。我的实验室使用频闪灯，这是创造非常不寻常视觉体验的另一种方式。同样，在这些条件下，人们有时会报告体验到他们以前从未见过的颜色。在《成为你：意识的新科学》一书中，你将世界描述为一种“**控制性幻觉**”（Controlled Hallucination: 大脑主动预测并构建现实，而非被动接收外部信息）。那么，你能定义一下并向我们解释一下吗？因为我觉得它与我们正在讨论的内容密切相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the philosopher Thomas Nagel years ago, 50 years ago, actually, wrote this uh this wonderful essay called, "What is it like to be a bat?" Now, I'm not saying being color blind is like being a bat. No. But his point was that, you know, for each of us, we have our subjective world, and that is unique to us. You know, everybody's world will be different. The subjective world of a bat is going to be very different because they have echolocation and all this other stuff. And the subjective world of someone with color blinds of Eucharist is going to be different with respect to color. Last week or the week before, there was this amazing new experiment published by I think it has a lab in in the US where they use lasers to stimulate one class of uh cell in the retina in the eye um that normally would never be activated just by itself. And they claimed they created a brand new color that no one had ever experienced in the world before. And of course then they tried to describe it and it was it's kind of fun like how do you describe a color that that the claims literally has never been seen before? You know words almost necessarily are going to fail. We use strooscopic light in my lab which is another way of creating very unusual visual experiences. And again in those conditions people report sometimes experiencing colors that they've never seen before. in in being you a new science of consciousness. You describe one idea of of seeing the world as as controlled hallucination. So can you define that and talk to us about about that because I feel like it really ties in with what we're talking about.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: **控制性幻觉**（Controlled Hallucination）这个想法不仅仅是对我们如何体验颜色的解释。我的意思是，这个想法的力量，至少对我来说，正如我试图在书中解释的那样，它是一种理解我们所体验的一切的方式，无论是情感，还是自由意志的感觉，或者是作为克里斯或阿尼尔的感觉。它是一种理解我们所体验的一切的方式。这个想法非常简单，而且非常古老。我的意思是，在思考颜色时，已经很清楚，我们所体验的并不是对客观世界中存在的事物的直接读取，因为颜色并不客观地存在于世界上。但现在，让我们稍微改变一下视角，从大脑的角度思考事物是什么样的。所以，想象一下你是一个大脑。大脑被锁在头骨这个骨质的穹窿里。你知道，粗略地说，它试图弄清楚世界上或身体里到底发生了什么。大脑所能依靠的只有通过眼睛、耳朵等传来的电感觉信号。光线不会直接进入大脑。大脑里是黑暗的，是寂静的。大脑所拥有的只是与世界上事物间接相关的电信号。它们没有标签。所以大脑必须根据这些模糊的、无标签的、无色的、无声的感觉信号来推断，做出关于世界上正在发生什么的最佳猜测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The idea of controlled hallucination is is not just an account of how we experience color. I mean the power of the idea at least for me and as I try to explain in the book it's a way of understanding everything that we experience whether it's an emotion or a sense of free will or the sense of being Chris or or being Annel. It's a it's it's a way of understanding everything that we experience whatsoever. The idea is is pretty simple and it's pretty old. I mean, in thinking about color, it's already clear that what we experience isn't this direct readout of what's objectively out there in the world, because colors aren't objectively out there in the world. But now, let's switch perspective a little bit and think about what things are like from the perspective of a brain. So, imagine being a brain. A brain is locked inside this bony vault of a skull. And you know to a first approximation what it's trying to do is figure out what the hell is going on out there in the world or in here in the body. All the brain has to go on are these electrical sensory signals that arrive via the eyes and the ears and so on. And light doesn't just get right into the brain. It's dark in the brain and it's silent. All the brain has are electrical signals that are only indirectly related to the things out there in the world. They don't have labels. So the brain has to infer, has to make a best guess about what is happening in the world based on these ambiguous, unlabeled, uncolored, unounded sensory signals.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 大脑通过不断地对它接收到的感觉信号做出预测，从而对世界上正在发生的事情做出最佳猜测。然后，大脑不是简单地读取感觉信号来形成世界的内部图像，而是不断更新这些预测。所以它们解释了传入的感觉信号。这里的关键思想是，在这个故事中，我们所体验的是这些由内而外的预测的内容。我们不是从外到内读取世界。我们总是主动地从内到外构建它，主动地生成它。现在事实证明，如果你做所有的数学计算和所有这些东西，如果你有一个大脑不断更新其自上而下、由内而外的预测，以最小化传入的感觉信号，试图在它们发生之前解释它们、预测它们。从数学上讲，这是大脑非常非常好的方式，可以精确地近似于世界上导致感觉信号的原因。这是做出最佳猜测的非常好方式。这就是这个主张。这就是我们所体验的。这就是为什么我称之为**控制性幻觉**（Controlled Hallucination），这个术语，你知道，就像所有好的类比一样。但我喜欢这个想法，因为它强调我们的体验主要来自内部。所以这就是幻觉的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The brain makes this best guess about what's happening in the world by continually making predictions about the sensory signals that it's getting. And then instead of just reading out the sensory signals to sort of form this inner picture of the world, the brain is continually updating the predictions. So they explain away um the sensory signals that are coming in. And the key idea here is that what we experience in this story is the content of these inside out predictions. We don't read out the world from the outside in. We always actively construct it, actively generate it from the inside out. Now it turns out math if you do all the maths and all this stuff that if you have a brain which is continually updating its top down inside out predictions to minimize you know the the sensory signals that are coming in to try and you know explain them predict them before they happen. That mathematically is a very very good way for the brain to um approximate exactly what caused the sensory signals out there in the world. It's a very good way to make a best guess. And that's the claim. That's what we experience. And that's why I call it a controlled hallucination, which is a term, you know, like all good analogies. But I like the idea because it emphasizes that our experiences come largely from within. Uh so that's the hallucination part.</p>

### 身体与情感：詹姆斯理论的统一性

Chris: 我理解这种由内而外和由外而内的舞蹈的一种方式是，我看到一些令人兴奋的东西，我的心开始砰砰直跳，我的心砰砰直跳是因为我兴奋。然后还有一种想法是，我看到一些东西，我的心开始砰砰直跳，然后我的大脑必须决定，你的心砰砰直跳是因为你感到恐惧还是因为你感到兴奋，而且科学似乎越来越倾向于后者而不是前者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A way for me to understand this inside out and outside in dance is I see something exciting and my heart starts pounding and my heart is pounding because I am excited. And then there's also the idea that I see something and my heart starts pounding and then my brain has to decide are your is your heart pounding because you are terrified or because you are excited and that increasingly the the science seems to be pointing towards the second rather than the first. </p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 对。有一个来自威廉·詹姆斯（William James）的情感理论，他像许多心理学理论一样，在19世纪就提出了这些想法。但正是詹姆斯和另一位名叫卡尔·兰格（Carl Lange）的人首次以这种方式提出问题，他们举了一个看到熊的例子。所以你看到一只灰熊或类似的东西，你感到非常害怕，肾上腺素开始在你的身体里涌动，所以你跑开了。在这种思考方式中，你知道，你看到熊，这导致了恐惧的情绪，而恐惧的情绪引发了所有这些身体反应，让你能够逃跑或战斗，如果你真的想和一只灰熊战斗，那是个坏主意。而詹姆斯则颠倒了这种观点，这是一种相同的颠倒。所以詹姆斯认为正在发生的是，我们体验到的恐惧情绪主要是大脑对身体对熊的反应的感知。所以因果链现在微妙但重要地不同了。我们看到一只熊，大脑记录到有一只熊，因为那是它对世界上存在的事物的最佳控制性幻觉。我的意思是，这本身仍然是一种推断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. There's a theory of emotion from William James who who like many theories in psychology came up with these ideas back in the 19th century. But it was it was James and another guy called Carl Langanger who first put things this way and they gave the example of seeing a bear. So you see a grizzly bear or something, you feel very afraid and adrenaline starts coursing through your body and so you run away. Um, and in this way of thinking about it, you know, you see the bear, that causes an emotion of fear, and the emotion of fear sets and train all these bodily responses that allow you to to run away or fight if you you really want to fight a grizzly bear, which is bad idea. Um, and James kind of flipped that and it's a it's a it's the same kind of flip. So what James suggested was going on was that what we experience as the emotion of fear is more is mostly the brain's perception of the body's response to the bear. So the chain of causation is now subtly but importantly different. We see a bear, brain registers there's a bear cuz that's its best controlled hallucination of what's out there in the world. I mean that itself is is still an inference.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 对熊的视觉感知立即引发了身体中的所有这些生理变化，皮质醇、肾上腺素，所有这些。然后，正是大脑在熊在场的情况下对这些变化的感知，构成了恐惧的情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That visual perception of the bear immediately sets in train all these physiological changes in the body, cortisol, adrenaline, all of that. And then it's the brain's perception of these changes in the context of a bear being present that is the emotion of of fear.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 这是一种有用的思考方式，因为身体的内部，你知道，身体的状态，甚至身体内部的身体，大脑也必须推断出来。对我来说，一个“啊哈”时刻是将这个**詹姆斯-兰格情绪理论**（James-Lange Theory of Emotion: 认为情绪体验是身体对刺激做出反应后的感知）视为与视觉感知工作原理的基本相同。所以就像大脑必须推断其视觉信号的原因，那就是我们所看到的。它正在对外面发生的事情做出预测。完全相同的机制可以实现詹姆斯所建议的。它可以对身体内部发生的事情做出最佳猜测，这成为情感体验。如果你是一个理论型的人，这会让你感到满足，因为你有一个简单的原则，大脑做出并更新预测，现在可以将以前两个截然不同的人类体验理解领域结合起来：一方面是视觉感知，另一方面是情感。我发现当你拥有这些统一的原则时，并且你可以通过相同的底层机制开始理解人类体验的不同领域时，这非常有吸引力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And this is is a useful way to think about it because the interior of the body you know the state of the body even on the body on the inside the brain has to infer that too. One of the aha moments for me was to think of this James theory of emotion as actually basically identical to these ideas about how visual perception works. So just as the brain has to infer the causes of its visual signals and that's what we see. It's making predictions about what's out there. The exact same mechanism can do what James was suggesting happens. it can make its best guess about what's happening in the inside of the body and that becomes experiences of emotion. And that's kind of satisfying from a a sort of if you're a theory person, it's very satisfying because you got one simple principle, the brain making and updating predictions that can now bring together what were previously two quite different fields of understanding human experience. you know, visual perception on the one hand and emotion on the other. And I I very I find very appealing when you have these unifying principles and you can start to understand you know different domains of human experience through the same underlying mechanism.</p>

### 超越“大脑即计算机”的隐喻

Chris: 我认为许多人，尤其是在西方世界，他们经常把大脑想象成一台超级计算机，一台非常智能的机器，正在处理信息，而且他们认为大脑的这种形象通常与身体的其他部分是相当分离的。在我看来，你似乎在说，它更像是一种全身心的体验，而不仅仅是锁在头顶的超级计算机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that many people especially in the in the western world they often have this idea of the brain as like a supercomput like a a very uh hyper intelligent machine that is processing information and they that image of the brain is is often quite separate from the rest of the body. It seems to me like you are saying that it it is quite a bit more like the full body experience than just the locked away supercomput in in the top.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我认为“大脑即计算机”这个想法一直是一个极其强大的隐喻。但它正在达到极限。你知道，大脑的复杂性是如此难以捉摸。我认为科学家们一直在努力弄清楚，我们如何才能概念化我们头脑中这种灰色粘液中正在发生的事情。最初，它是一个管道系统，然后是一个电话网络。自20世纪50年代以来，计算机的隐喻一直非常强大。强大到我们理所当然地认为大脑进行计算和处理信息。而且，你知道，如果你以正确的方式编程一台真正的硅计算机，你就会得到真实大脑所能得到的一切，包括——我们稍后会回到这一点——意识。而这正是我开始对这个隐喻感到非常不舒服的地方。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think this idea of the brain as a computer has been an extremely powerful metaphor. Um but it's reaching its limits. You know the brain is this is pretty implacable in its complexity. And I think scientists have always struggled to figure out how how can we conceptualize what's what's happening in this gray goo inside our heads. And um initially it was a system of pipes and plumbing and then a telephone network. And since the 1950s this metaphor of a computer has been very powerful. So powerful that that we just sort of take it for granted that the brain computes and processes information. And um you know if you programmed a computer a real you know silicon computer in the right way you'd get everything that you get from real brains including and we'll come back to this consciousness and this is where I start to get really uncomfortable about this metaphor but the computer relies on something to implement the computations but it's it's you it's not nearly as intimately related to the body as you know our brains are related to our physical bodies.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 计算机依赖于某种东西来实现计算，但它与身体的关系远没有我们的身体与我们的大脑的关系那么密切。我认为这对于我们真正理解大脑如何工作以及它们是为什么而存在至关重要。你知道，身体不仅仅是这种基于肉体的机器人，它可以把我们的大脑计算机从一个会议带到下一个会议。如果你在进化的时间轴上回溯，每一个曾经存在的大脑都进化来控制、调节和引导一个身体。这才是大脑的根本目的。我倾向于认为我们已经达到了“大脑即计算机”隐喻的极限。大脑实际上比计算机更丰富，更复杂。我只想提一个关键区别，然后我很想听听你的看法，那就是我们所有计算机的一个关键原则是，我们在软件和硬件之间有清晰的分离。我可以在我的电脑上运行相同版本的任何程序，它在你的电脑上也会做同样的事情。在我的电脑上，我可以运行许多不同的程序，每次都会做同样的事情，对吧？如果它正常工作的话。而即使是一个单一的神经元也是一个非常复杂的生物机器，它试图维持自身的运转，你知道，一直到新陈代谢的深处。

<p class="english-text">And I think that's super important if we're ever to really understand how brains work and and what they're for. You know, the body isn't just this kind of meat-based robot that can take our brain computer from one meeting to the next. If you, you know, zoom backwards in evolutionary time, every brain that ever existed evolved to control and regulate and guide a body. That's what brains are fundamentally for. I'm inclined to think that we've reached the limits of the brain as computer metaphor. And the brain is actually much richer, much more complex than computers. There's one key difference that that I'll just mention and then I would love to see what you think of it, which is a key principle of all the computers we have um is that we have this sharp separation between software and hardware. I can run the same version of of whatever it is um Word on my computer. It will do the same thing on on yours. And on my computer, I can run many different programs and it'll do the same thing every time, right? If it's working properly. And even a single neuron is a very complicated biological machine that is trying to keep itself going, you know, right down into the furnaces of of metabolism.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 当你这样看待大脑并理解它们的丰富性，并看到它们与计算机有多么不同时，它确实削弱了它们正在进行计算的观点，因为计算在你有这种清晰分离时才有意义。而如果你没有这种分离，那么将大脑视为计算机就意义小得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you see brains like that and understand their their richness and see how different they are from from computers, then it really undermines the the idea that what they're doing is computation because computation makes sense when you've got this sharp separation. And to the extent you don't have that, then it makes much less sense to think of the brain as a computer.</p>
</details>

Chris: 是的，我认为这让我立即想到两件事，一是我们的身体和大脑之间的联系，就像你知道的，如果你锻炼，如果你举重或跑步，它会改变你大脑中的感受。它不仅仅改变你的身体，我认为如果我得到一个新鼠标，我不会认为它改变了我的电脑的感受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think that the the two things that it makes me immediately think of are one the connection between our our body and our brain in the sense of like you know if you exercise if you lift heavy weights or go for a run it changes how you feel in your brain. It doesn't just change your body in a way that I think if I get a new mouse I don't perceive that as changing how my computer feels. </p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 你说得对，我们的身体、大脑和思想之间存在着紧密的互动。我的意思是，我们的大脑是我们身体的一部分。我认为这也是我们经常忽视的一点，但大脑是一个器官，就像我们的心脏、肝脏、肾脏都是器官一样。但它是一个独特的器官。如果你要进行器官移植，大脑是你希望成为捐赠者而不是接受者的那个手术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. you're right that um there is this tight interaction between our bodies, our brains and our minds. I mean our brains are part of our bodies. I think this is also something we we often neglect but but the brain is is an organ just as much as our heart, our liver, our kidneys are organs. Uh but it's a it's a distinctive one. It's probably if you're going to have an organ transplant, the brain is the one operation for which you'd want to be the donor and not the recipient.</p>
</details>

Chris: 你在你的书中提出了一个问题，我认为对于所有正在听或看这个节目的人来说，也是一个非常重要的问题，那就是：作为你，你最紧紧抓住的方面是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You ask a question in your book and I think is a really important question for anyone who is listening to this or watching this to ask themselves as well. What is the aspect of being you that you cling to most tightly?</p>
</details>

### 自我、自由意志与伦理挑战

Anil Seth: 我认为我最紧紧抓住的自我方面是这种**自由意志**（Free Will: 个人做出选择和决定的能力，不受外部力量或预定命运的限制）的感觉。我的意思是，我认为我们的直觉在思考意识时可能误导我们的另一种方式是，认为自我只是一个东西，认为克里斯只有一个本质，阿尼尔·塞斯只有一个本质，但事实并非如此，在神经学、精神病学以及实验室中，我们有许多方法可以证明，作为自我的体验具有所有这些不同的方面，这些方面对我们大多数人来说，在大多数时候都以一种统一的方式呈现，但它们可以分离。例如，我们已经讨论过的情感是自我体验的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the aspect of self that um that I cling to most tightly is this sense of free will. I mean one of the other I think ways in which our intuition can mislead us when we think about consciousness is the idea that the self is just one thing that there is a single essence of Chrisy there isn't a single essence of of an Seth um but that's not the case and there are many ways in neurology psychiatry but also in the lab where we can show that the experience of being a self has all these different aspects which are all present in a kind of unified way for most of us most of the time but which can come apart. So for instance, emotion we already talked about is one part of the experience of self. </p>
</details>

Chris: 感觉这些问题正从有趣的学术问题，转变为真正实用且可应用的问题，坦率地说，这让我感到害怕。所以，我给你举一个我的例子，我很想听听你的看法，对我来说，我最紧紧抓住的“我”的方面，我认为是某种独特性，就像我就是我，没有另一个我存在。然而，如果有可能上传我的意识，或者拥有一个经过我的声音、我的写作和我的思维训练的人工智能，以至于它和我一样，但又不是我，这让我感到相当不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It feels like those are on the verge of crossing from the interesting academic questions into a really practical applicable question in a way that is quite frankly to me scary. I so I'll give you just my example that that I'm curious what you think about is for me the aspect of being me that I cling to most tightly is I think some version of uniqueness that like I am me and there isn't another me out there and yet if it was possible to upload my consciousness or to have an artificial intelligence that was trained on my voice and my writing and my thinking so much so that it was the same as me but not me that feels quite disturbing to me and</p>
</details>

Chris: 然而，想象一个我们达到那个境界的世界并非不可能。所以我很好奇听听你的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and yet it doesn't feel impossible to imagine a world where we get to that place. So So I'm curious to to hear your take on that.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 我认为你绝对正确，这就是我们所处的时代，这既可怕又令人兴奋，当然也是一个非常有趣的地方。你知道，作为一个关注这些事物的人，当然，在流行文化中，我们都这样做，但只是观察正在发生的事情，以及其背后的科学。而且它正在以许多方式发生。所以，你举的关于这些**数字替身**（Avatars: 在虚拟世界中代表用户身份的图像或模型）的例子真的非常引人入胜。我曾有几次机会拥有一个数字替身。我还没有接受它们，因为我有点担心，你知道，这其中有很多伦理问题，我对此感到担忧。但事实是，现在这已经可能了。我认为它仍然可以与我区分开来，但这正在变得，你知道，事情肯定会变得越来越好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you're absolutely right that this is these are the times we live in and that's both scary but also quite exciting and certainly very interesting place to be. you know, as as someone who's followed these things, of course, both in popular culture, as we all do, but just watching what's happening, the underlying science too. Um, and it's happening in many ways. So, there's the example you give about these these uh avatars is really is really fascinating. And I've had couple of opportunities to have a digital avatar. I haven't yet taken them up because I'm slightly worried about, you know, there are very ethical things about that that I'm I'm I'm concerned about. But the fact is it's it's now possible. I think it would be still distinguishable from me, but it's that's getting, you know, that things will just get better and and and better for sure.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 另一个例子，我认为我们正处于一个伦理和道德上都将非常具有挑战性的事情的边缘，那就是**脑机接口**（Brain-Computer Interfaces - BCIs: 连接大脑和外部设备的系统）以及你可以刺激大脑。这里有一种情况，一方面，你拥有所有这些惊人的临床益处，你根本无法反驳，而且你真的不应该反驳，因为它们非常出色。你可以帮助**帕金森病**（Parkinson's Disease: 一种进行性神经系统疾病，影响运动）患者。你可以为瘫痪的人恢复行动能力。你有可能为盲人恢复视力。我的意思是，这即将到来。所有这些惊人的干预措施都在地平线上，甚至在某些情况下已经出现。但随后你进入了**认知增强**（Cognitive Enhancements: 提高认知能力（如记忆力、注意力）的技术或方法）的另一个领域。你知道，一个没有瘫痪、失明或帕金森病的人，我们是否都应该像现在都拥有手机一样拥有脑机接口？嗯，那是一个非常非常不同的世界，这是一个如果你把它推向极端，像自由意志这样的东西，你知道，至少对我来说，它非常核心，也是独特性的一部分。你知道，我觉得这些想法是我的想法。我觉得我的行动是我的行动。但如果现在有一个脑机接口，它不仅仅是读取我的意图来完成某事，而是实际上导致我产生我感觉是自己的意图和想法，但我原本不会这样想，这对我来说相当可怕，因为一旦你进入了大脑，就没有其他地方可去了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, the other example where I think we're on the cusp of something that's going to be ethically and morally very challenging is with brain computer interfaces and you can stimulate the brain too. And here's a situation where on the one hand you've got all these amazing clinical benefits that you just can't argue against and you really shouldn't argue against because they're they're brilliant. You can help people with Parkinson disease. You can restore paralysis uh to people. You can restore sight to blind people potentially. I mean that that's coming. All these these amazing interventions that are on the horizon or even here now in some cases. But then you get to this um other terrain of cognitive enhancements. you know, can someone who's not got paralysis or blindness or Parkinson disease um should we all have brain computer interfaces just as we all have cell phones these days? Well, that's a very very different um world and it's a world where you if you take it to the to an extreme something like free will which you know is at least for me pretty central and part of uniqueness too. You know I feel that the thoughts are my thoughts. I feel that that my actions are my actions. But if now there's a a a brain computer interface that is not merely reading out my intentions to get something done, but actually causing me to have intentions and thoughts that I feel are my own, but I would not have otherwise thought, that's pretty scary to me because once you've got into the brain, there's nowhere else to go.</p>
</details>

### 保护意识：理解与知情

Chris: 作为普通人，我们应该做些什么来保护我们的意识，或者以一种我们不会在一个我们不想生活的世界中醒来的方式来思考它？我们能做些什么，或者我们如何才能在不同的层面上理解这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What should we be doing as regular people to protect our consciousness or to think about it in a way where we won't just wake up in a world that's not the world we want to live in? What what can we do or how can we uh understand this in a different level?</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 是的，这是一个非常难以回答的问题。我认为乐观的一面是，我们仍然有时间来塑造这些事情的未来。我们还没有达到解决已经出现的问题的阶段，例如我们如何控制社交媒体的社会问题后果。我们仍然可以决定我们想要什么样的技术，不想要什么样的技术，以及它们应该如何被监管或提供。但是，你知道，我认为有一些事情是普通人可以做的。你知道，我们都可以做，这听起来可能有点陈词滥调或试图这样说，但最重要的是不要害怕尝试理解正在发生的事情，对吧？我们必须知情。如果我们不了解这些技术的作用，以及我们自己的大脑如何工作。你知道，我们不必了解每一个细节。我不是要求人们去攻读神经科学学位等等，但我们对自己的思维方式了解得越多，我认为我们就越能就我们想要什么样的技术做出明智的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I it's it's a very difficult question to to answer. I think the good side of the optimistic view is that there's still time to shape the future in these things. We're not already at the stage of fixing problems um that have already come to exist as we are for instance and how how do we rein in the society problematic consequences of of social media. We can still decide what kinds of technologies we want and what kinds of technology we don't want and how they should be regulated and and or made available. But, you know, I think there are things that, you know, regular folk can do. You know, we we can all do and it it's sort of it may sound slightly cliched or try to say it, but but the most important thing is to just not be scared of of trying to understand what's going on, right? We have to be informed. if we're not informed about what these technologies do um and also how our own brains work too. You know, we don't have to understand every detail. I'm not asking people to go and do whole neuroscience degrees and so on, but the more we understand um how our own minds work, I think the better we'll be able to make informed decisions about the kinds of technologies um that we want to people who are caring for family members and loved ones who have cognitive decline and dementia where this question of is this my mother? Is this my father? Is this the person that I've known? Is not a hypothetical question and it's not a a far-off technological question, but it's kind of a practical day-to-day question of like who is this person that I love and that I care for? And are they the same person they have been? And because you've been in that situation.</p>
</details>

### 意识的连续性与文化视角

Anil Seth: 所以，我在书中描述的那一集，我的母亲在医院接受手术。她当时快80岁了。但是医院里出了问题，她得了我后来才知道的，医生称之为**医院诱发性谵妄**（Hospital-induced Delirium: 住院期间因疾病、药物或环境变化引起的急性精神状态改变），我以前从未听说过，而且据说这在老年人中非常常见，这个名字立即暗示人们根本不知道发生了什么。它听起来就像是18世纪的名字，但它是一种严重的迷失方向，但也伴随着性格的改变。她不认识我。她以为我是别人，看起来像一个非常不同的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the the episode I described in in the book, my mother was in a hospital for um operation. She was um just shy of 80 years old. Uh but there were problems in the hospital and she had what I later learned was what her doctors call hospital induced delirium which I'd never heard of before and it's apparently very common especially in older people and the name is immediately suggestive of people actually don't know what what's going on at all. It's sort of a name straight out of the 18th century it sounded like to me but it's a severe disorientation but also a change of personality. She didn't recognize me. she thought I was somebody else and appeared to be a very different person.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 那个问题解决了，但是是的，从那以后的几年里，这是一个持续的过程，你知道，她和我不得不适应非常不同的环境。所以一个人可以通过许多方式继续是同一个人，即使他们不再知道自己是谁或在哪里，或者其他人是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That resolved but but yes in the in the years since then it's it's been a continual process um in which you know she and I have had to adapt to very different circumstances. So there are many ways in which a person can continue to be the same person even if they no longer know much about who they are or where they are, who other people are.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 对我来说，这，你知道，我认为这是一个有用的策略。它帮助我认识到，你知道，在这些相当剧烈的变化之下，存在着一种深刻的连续性，但仍然存在连续性。当然，对我们来说也是如此。你知道，我们也在改变，但我们只是没有体验到自身的改变，因为，你知道，长话短说，当事物变化非常缓慢时，我们往往不会察觉到它们在变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for me that's been, you know, I think that's been a useful strategy. It it it helps me recognize that, you know, there's a there's a deep continuity, you know, underlying these these fairly dramatic changes, but there's there's nonetheless a continuity. And of course, the same is true for us. You know, we're we're changing too, but we just don't experience the change in ourselves um because we, you know, to cut the long story there, very short, when things change very slowly, we tend not to perceive them as changing.</p>
</details>

Chris: 我觉得这非常深刻，也非常令人安慰。它不可能失去，因为它是一个持续的转变过程，贯穿多年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I find that to be so profound and so comforting. It's impossible to lose it because it is a continuous transformation through the years.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 对，它一开始就不存在，所以也无从失去，对吧？它一直都是一个过程。而且，我认为重要的是，在谈论这些事情时，要指出这些想法当然一直是许多精神传统的核心。你知道，在佛教中，在许多冥想实践中，在一定程度上也在印度教中，将自我视为一个过程，视为一种多方面的、构建的身份，我的意思是，这对于来自不同文化的人来说并不是新闻。而我发现非常引人入胜的是，这些不同思维方式的汇流和融合，并不是说科学只是在讲述同一个故事，而是2000年后它讲述了一个不同的故事，这个故事中，我们从神经科学和现代哲学中学到的关于自我的知识，我认为丰富了已经存在的故事，反之亦然。我认为理解意识是这场战斗的一部分，我们带着所有关于我们试图理解的事物的先入之见，但实际上，作为自我的体验并不简单。当我们拓宽视野，看向其他文化和其他传统时，我认为我们对意识研究应该关注什么会有更丰富的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. It was never there in the first place to to be lost, right? It's always been this this process. And um I think it's it's important just talking about these things to just to point out that these these ideas have of course been central to many spiritual traditions. you know in in Buddhism um in a lot of meditative practice in in in Hinduism as well to some extent the idea of the self as process as identity as sort of multifaceted as constructed I mean this is not news to many people from different cultures and what I find quite fascinating is is the the confluence the convergence between these different ways of thinking and it's not that it's not that just science is basically telling the same story but 2,000 years later it's telling a different story that that it's a story in which what we are learning from the neuroscience and the philosophy modern philosophy about the self I think enriches the stories that were already there but also vice versa I think understanding consciousness that's part of the battle we come with all these preconceptions about what it is that we're trying to understand but actually the experience of being a self is not simple And when we widen the lens to other cultures and other traditions, I think we get a richer view of what consciousness research should be about.</p>
</details>

### 药物与意识：脑与现实的连接

Chris: 我觉得如果谈论意识和自我而不问你关于药物，**致幻剂**（Hallucinogenic Drugs: 能够改变感知、情绪和思维过程的物质）以及合法的**麻醉剂**（Anesthetic Drugs: 用于引起麻醉状态的药物）的问题，那将是职业上的失职，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel like it would be professional malpractice to have had a conversation about consciousness and the self and to not ask you about drugs, hallucinogenic drugs and also legal uh anesthetic drugs, right? Like</p>
</details>

Chris: 我能够被麻醉进行手术，醒来后没有任何记忆或任何可能的方式来访问那段时间，这如何影响你对意识的看法？然后，相关地，如果我服用**LSD**（Lysergic acid diethylamide: 一种强效致幻剂）或**致幻蘑菇**（Hallucinogenic Mushrooms: 含有致幻物质的蘑菇）或任何其他类型的物质，并改变我对世界的体验，这又如何影响意识？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how does the fact that I can be put under to undergo an operation and wake up and have no memory or any possible way of accessing that time, how does that affect your ideas about consciousness? And then relatedly, if I can take LSD or hallucinogenic mushrooms or any of these other types of substances and change my experience of the world, how does that affect consciousness?</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 更多的致幻剂，特别是**迷幻药**（Psychedelic Drugs: 一类能引起感知、情绪和认知显著改变的致幻剂），对我来说，强调了意识与大脑之间的密切联系。你服用一种不同的化学物质，现在它以一种不同的电化学操作、药理学操作来干扰大脑的运作，现在你不是失去意识，而是意识发生了改变，而且改变得极其剧烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The more hallucenic drugs in particular psychedelic drugs for me anyway emphasizes the intimate connection between consciousness and the brain. You take a different chemical now interfere in the brain's business with a different kind of electrochemical manipulation pharmacological manipulation and now instead of losing consciousness it changes and it changes extremely dramatically.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 所以，你知道，我发现这是一个非常好的证据，它与意识是大脑所做的事情的观点高度兼容。你知道，你干预大脑，意识就会改变。有趣的是，你知道，你可以用一种非常不同的方式来看待它。你可以将你在迷幻药上的体验视为对现实本质的某种洞察，并得出非常不同的结论，即“哦，你看，我体验到意识实际上是宇宙的一个基本属性，所以它根本不依赖于大脑。”这完全取决于你的先验知识，你带着什么进入它。对我来说，它强化了意识对大脑的依赖。但我认为在每种情况下，迷幻药都可以显示，嗯，也许不是在每种情况下，但肯定从迷幻药改变大脑，从而改变意识的角度来看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I you know I find this very very good uh evidence is highly compatible with a sort of view that consciousness is something the brain does. You know you intervene in the brain and consciousness changes. Interestingly you know you can take it in a very different way. You could take the experiences that you have on psychedelics as some sort of insight into the nature of reality and come to a very different conclusion that oh look you know I've experienced um that consciousness is in fact a fundamental property of the universe and so it doesn't depend on the brain at all. It all depends on your prior what you come into it with. For me it sort of reinforces the dependence of consciousness on the brain. But I think in each case um psychedelics can show well for well maybe not in each case but certainly from the perspective that psychedelics change the brain and that changes consciousness.</p>
</details>

Anil Seth: 它确实强调了我们所体验的是一种建构，因为你改变了大脑功能的某些方面，改变了我们意识体验的某些方面，而这些方面我们可能原本会认为是理所当然的。你知道，我们可以意识到这些是大脑正在做的事情，因为它们改变了或者它们消失了。所以对我来说，它提供了很多关于意识那些需要解释的方面的洞察力，这与所有潜在的治疗益处完全分开，我认为这些益处也非常令人兴奋，非常有趣。我认为关于它们的整体疗效，还需要一段时间才能得出结论。但那里肯定有很多丰富的潜力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a it really underlines that what we experience is is a construction because you change aspects of brain function aspects of our conscious experience that we might otherwise take for granted. You know, we we can realize are things that the brain is doing um because they're changed or or they go away. So for me it's a very in it provides a lot of insight into those aspects of of consciousness which need explaining and that's entirely separate from all the the potential therapeutic benefits which I which I think are also very exciting very interesting. I think the jury's is going to be out for a little while on their on their overall efficacy. Um but there's there's a certainly a lot of rich potential there.</p>
