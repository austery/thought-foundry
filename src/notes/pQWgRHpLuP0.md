### 市场概览与本周焦点

大家好，欢迎回到本频道。我们又回到了每日回顾的节目。这是本周的第一次每日回顾。我昨天因为和家人一起庆祝排灯节（Divali）而缺席了，祝所有庆祝排灯节的人节日快乐。本周股市开局非常疯狂，过去两天发生了不少事情。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. First daily recap for the week. Missed yesterday because I was with my family for Dvali. Happy Dvali to all those that celebrate. Uh been a pretty crazy two days as we start off this week in the stock market.</p>
</details>

我们今天正式迎来了大型科技公司的财报季。我们将讨论Netflix的业绩，其盘后下跌了5%，这算不上是最好的财报，也算不上是最差的财报。亚马逊、谷歌和OpenAI这三家公司今天都有大量不同的公告，我们也将讨论这些。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We officially have big tech earnings that begin today. Netflix, we'll talk about Netflix results. Down 5% after hours. Wasn't the best earnings, wasn't the worst earnings, but we'll talk about that. Amazon, Google, and OpenAI, all three of them. Tons of different announcements today. We'll talk about those.</p>
</details>

特朗普一如既往地对中国发表了一些评论，希望这些谈判能尽快开始，我们将在十月底讨论这些。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump made some more comments on China as always. Hopefully, this negotiations will be starting soon, which we'll be discussing as we get into the end of October.</p>
</details>

今天我们要谈论的另一个主要话题是黄金。黄金正在下跌，自2013年4月以来，其市值损失了1.75万亿美元，这是最糟糕的一天。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then the other main thing that we got to talk about today is gold. Gold is going down. Lost its worst amount of market cap, 1.75 trillion with a T since April 2013.</p>
</details>

与此同时，**标普500**（S&P 500: 美国500家最大上市公司股票指数）基本处于历史高位，**道琼斯指数**（Dow Jones: 美国历史最悠久、最具代表性的股票价格指数之一）距离历史高位也只差40美元左右。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, the S&P 500 basically all-time highs. Dow Jones was like 40 bucks away from all-time highs.</p>
</details>

许多像Oaklow、Quantum股票、核能股、无人机股以及Big Bear AI等动量股今天都受到了冲击。我们必须讨论更广泛的市场、大宗商品以及这些可能正在失去动力的动量股发生了什么。让我们开始吧。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and a lot of the Oaklows and Quantum stocks and nuclear names and drone stocks and big bear AIs took a hit today. We got to talk about what's going on with the broader market, what's going on with commodities, and what's going on with these momentum plays that might be losing some momentum. Let's get into it.</p>
</details>

### 动量股面临回调压力

好的，让我们从更广泛的市场中一些动量股的情况开始，因为我认为讨论这一点非常重要。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so let's get started with what's going on in the broader market in regards to some of these momentum stocks because I think it is very very important to talk about this.</p>
</details>

在过去一周，Oaklow下跌了10%，D-Wave下跌了27%，Big Bear下跌了21%，Rigetti下跌了27%，IonQ下跌了29%，SMR下跌了14%，NANO Nuclear下跌了22%，稀土公司MP Materials下跌了25%，US Rare Earth下跌了20%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So over the past week, Oaklow is down 10%, D-Wave down 27, Big Bear down 21, Regetti down 27, andQ down 29, SM SMR down 14, nanuclear down 22, MP and US AR, rare earth companies, MP is down 25%, US AR is down 20%.</p>
</details>

名单上还有很多其他公司，比如Ondas下跌了30%。我们可以列举过去几周，甚至是过去几个月，积累了大量动力的各种公司，它们现在都受到了冲击。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of other names on that list. Ondos down 30%, we can go through a variety of different names that have essentially picked up tons of momentum over the past couple of weeks, really the the past couple of months. They're all getting hit.</p>
</details>

现在，问题来了，我想谈谈我对目前情况的看法。我很想知道大家在评论中怎么想。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here's the question and and then then I want to get to my opinion on kind of what's happening right here. I would love to know what people think in the comments.</p>
</details>

你认为我们看到这些公司股价下跌，它们并没有最大的盈利潜力或营收潜力吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think the decline we're seeing in some of these names that don't really have the most earnings potential, revenue potential?</p>
</details>

我的意思是，除了叙事之外，它们并没有真正展现出任何东西。Big Bear AI在人工智能这个行业中，其他公司增长超过50%，而它却预测负增长，让我再说一遍，是负5%的增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they're not really showing anything other than the narrative Big Bear AI is guiding to negative, let me say that again, negative 5% growth in the sector where companies are growing over 50%, which is AI.</p>
</details>

所以，有些公司的股票代码里有“AI”，但它们根本无法增长，今年甚至出现负增长，但年初至今却上涨了80%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you've got companies that have AI in their ticker that cannot grow at all. They're negative growing this year that are up 80% year to date.</p>
</details>

这些公司中很多并非世界上最差的公司，但它们基本上是由一个叙事所驱动的。这个叙事并没有带来任何有意义的盈利增长或营收增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of these companies are not the worst companies in the world, but they are companies that have been essentially cultivated by a narrative. That narrative has not resulted in any meaningful earnings growth, any meaningful revenue growth.</p>
</details>

但如果你看所有这些股票，很多年初至今都上涨了四到五倍。我的意思是，这相当不可思议。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But those stocks, if you look at all of them, a lot of them are up four to 5x a year to date. I mean, it is quite incredible.</p>
</details>

我对在座各位的问题是，你认为这种正在客观消退的动量（到目前为止，我们还没有看到这种动量真正逆转回来）是这些股票结构性的动量下降，还是它们只是在喘息？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My question to everyone here is do you think the momentum that is dying out objectively which it you know so far we've seen no real reversal of that momentum coming back is that a structural momentum decline in these stocks or are they taking a breather?</p>
</details>

我的看法是，我不知道，而且我认为没有人能真正知道。我们都在猜测事情会如何发展。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My take on this is that I don't know and I don't think anyone can really know. We're all just guessing here in terms of what's or how this is playing out.</p>
</details>

但如果你必须查看我们正在获得的一些数据，确实感觉它们正在失去更多的动力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you have to look at some of the data that we're getting, it does feel like they're losing more momentum than not.</p>
</details>

它们失去动力的原因很简单，就是它们涨得太多了，人们想要获利了结。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason they're losing momentum is because, simply put, they've gone up a lot and people want to take some profits.</p>
</details>

当你有一只像英伟达（Nvidia）这样涨幅很大的股票，并且它能持续实现盈利增长时，人们可能就不想获利了结。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you have a stock that goes up a lot like an Nvidia, and it can, you know, keep putting up earnings growth, you might have people that might not want to take some profits.</p>
</details>

我今年一股英伟达的股票都没卖。我的平均成本是122美元，现在股价是180美元，我上涨了50%。但我不想卖，因为我认为英伟达可以继续保持盈利增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've not sold a single share of Nvidia all year. My average is 122, stocks at 180. I'm up 50%. But I don't want to sell because I think Nvidia can continue the earnings growth.</p>
</details>

对于很多这些公司，如果你是基于“Oaklow会因为核能而变得很大，我们需要核能”这个想法买入的，那么除了这句话之外，没有什么真正能让你坚持这个叙事。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a lot of these names, if you bought it off the idea that, well, Oakllo is going to be big because it's nuclear energy and we need nuclear energy, there's nothing really holding you into the narrative outside of that one sentence.</p>
</details>

没有盈利，没有营收，也没有任何大规模的交易，你知道，它们确实有正在进行的交易，但并没有体现出任何你可以明确地说正在帮助公司的具体成果。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no earnings, there's no revenue, there's not any of these massive deals, and you know, there have deals in the pipeline, but it's not manifesting anything you can tangibly say is actually helping the company right now.</p>
</details>

很多量子计算公司也是如此。再次强调，这并不是要看空或质疑所有这些不同的公司。我没有持有它们的头寸，也没有做空它们，也没有买入它们的看跌期权。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same thing with a lot of the quantum names. And again, this is not being bearish or skeptical of all these different companies that are out there. I don't have positions on them. I don't have shorts on them. I don't have puts on them.</p>
</details>

这并不是那个意思。它更像是在说，嘿，为了这个牛市的健康发展，我们能否弄清楚这些公司是否有继续上涨的有效性和合法性？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not to say that. It's rather saying, hey, for the health of this bull market, can we figure out, do these names have the validity, the legitimacy to keep going higher?</p>
</details>

动量的问题在于，当动量消退时（我们上周讨论过），它真的很难再回来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the the thing about momentum is that when momentum dies, we were talking about this last week, it's really hard to get it back.</p>
</details>

唯一能让它回来的方式是如果你能实现良好的盈利增长。Palantir和Robinhood在2023-2024年曾是动量股。如果这些公司在过去九个月没有实现巨大的盈利增长（两者都超过50%），它们就不会有2025年的表现。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's re the only way you get it back is if you put up good earnings growth. Pounder and Robin Hood were momentum stocks back in 23 24. would not have had the 2025 they had if those companies did not put up the gigantics earnings growth. Both of them over 50% that they did in the past nine months.</p>
</details>

所以，你可能不同意Palantir的估值倍数，你可能不同意Robinhood的估值倍数，你甚至可能不同意苹果（Apple）的估值倍数。苹果以35倍市盈率交易，每年增长约5%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you can disagree with Palantra's multiple. You can disagree with Hood's multiple. You can disagree with freaking Apple's multiple. Apple trading at 35 times earnings growing like 5% a year.</p>
</details>

你不能说它们不值得这个估值倍数，因为它们正在增长，并且正在回购股票。苹果拥有1000亿美元的现金，它们是优质公司，正在向世界推出真正重要的产品和服务。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can't say they don't deserve a multiple because they are growing and they are buying back stock. Apple with 100 billion and they are quality companies that are putting out products and services in the world that really do matter.</p>
</details>

换句话说，它们拥有**护城河**（Moat: 商业领域指公司相对于竞争对手的持久竞争优势）。很多其他股票并没有真正的护城河，没有真正的盈利。很多甚至没有营收。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Aka they have a moat. A lot of these other stocks don't really have a moat, don't really have earnings. A lot of them don't have revenue.</p>
</details>

它们基本上在短短两个月内被推高。我知道年初至今它们表现非常好，但在过去两个月，它们才真正获得了买盘，而这种买盘可能正在消退。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They essentially got bid up in the span of over basically call it two months. I know year to date they've done very very well, but over the past two months that's where they really got the bid and that bid might be fading.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为我们所有人都必须理解现在正在发生什么。**标普500**（S&P 500）距离历史高点只差2美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think it's important for all of us to just understand what is happening right now. The S&P 500 is $2 away from alltime highs.</p>
</details>

两周前，当标普500处于历史高点时，许多上涨了30%到40%的股票现在下跌了30%到40%。标普500几乎没有下跌1%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot of these stocks that were up 30 to 40% when the S&P 500 was at all-time highs two weeks ago are down 30 to 40%. The S&P 500 is barely down 1%.</p>
</details>

英伟达回到了180美元。我的意思是，是的，它从195美元跌到了180美元，但英伟达并没有崩盘。Palantir也没有崩盘。Robinhood也没有崩盘。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia back to 180. I mean, yes, it's down from 195 to 180. But Nvidia has not collapsed. Palunter has not collapsed. Robin Hood's not collapsed.</p>
</details>

是的，它从150美元跌到了130美元，但Robinhood在被纳入标普500后从97美元涨到了130美元。我认为这对Robinhood来说是一个相当大的涨幅，但它值得150美元吗？可能不值得。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, down from 150 to 130, but Palter's up from or Hood's up from 97 to 130 after S&P inclusion. I think that's a pretty big run for Robin Hood, but did it deserve 150? Probably not.</p>
</details>

所以，它正在喘息。这些股票中有些我不知道它们是在喘息，还是在结构上失去了买盘，因为一旦你失去了买盘，一旦你失去了动量，一旦你失去了叙事，我的意思是，真的很难再找回来。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's taking a breather. Some of these stocks, I don't know if they're taking breathers or structurally they've lost the bid because once you've lost the bid, once you've lost the momentum, once you've lost the narrative, I mean, it's really hard to get it back.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是我对大家的问题。我对这个问题的最终看法很简单。我认为要保持牛市继续，你需要像AMD或苹果这样昨天创下历史新高的优质公司来达到这些历史新高。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, that is my question to everybody. My final take on this is very simple. I think to keep the bull market going, you need quality companies like an AMD or an Apple that hit all-time highs yesterday to get those all-time highs.</p>
</details>

当你有很多股票（大约有30到40只）无缘无故上涨时，你不可能有一个有意义的牛市。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You cannot have a meaningful bull run when you have lots of stocks. There's like over 30 to 40 of them that run up for no reason.</p>
</details>

再次强调，这些股票可能跌到零，这不会影响更广泛的市场。这些股票可能涨到300亿、400亿美元的市值。可能仍然不会影响更广泛的市场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, those stocks could go to zero, doesn't affect the broader market. Those stocks could go up to, you know, 30, 40 billion market cap. Probably still doesn't affect the broader market.</p>
</details>

但这不健康。我们知道这不健康。如果我们不是在开玩笑，如果我们实话实说，我们知道那不健康。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's not healthy. We know it's not healthy. If we're if if we're not, you know, kidding, if we're calling a spade a spade, we're not kidding with ourselves. We know that's not healthy.</p>
</details>

所以，这不是看空市场。讽刺的是，这是尽可能看多市场。为了保持牛市的动量，一切都不应该仅仅为了上涨而上涨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, it's not about being bearish the market. It's ironically being as bullish as you can about the market. And to keep that bull market momentum going, everything shouldn't be running for the hell of running.</p>
</details>

那不是牛市。那是泡沫。那是顶部。那是狂热。那就是我们在互联网泡沫和2021年看到的情况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is not a bull market. That is a bubble. That is a top. That is euphoric. That is what we saw in the.com bubble and in 2021.</p>
</details>

考虑到我们大多数人都经历过2021年，你知道，不是每个人都经历过2008年或互联网泡沫。但2021年，这些股票不值得它们的估值倍数。它们得到了估值倍数。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And given most of us live through 2021, you know, not everyone lived through 2008 or the docom bubble. But 2021, these stocks didn't deserve their mult multiple. They got the multiple.</p>
</details>

我们不仅仅是在谈论那些随机的股票。我们谈论的是Meta、亚马逊等等。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're not just talking about the random stocks. We're talking about the metas, Amazons, etc.</p>
</details>

Meta、亚马逊、谷歌等这些股票没有获得巨大的估值倍数，而那些随机的股票却获得了巨大的估值倍数，我认为这是看涨的，因为它意味着大型股票中没有泡沫。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that those stocks, Meta, Amazon, Google, etc. are not getting a massive multiple. But these random stocks are getting a massive multiple I think is bullish because it means there's not a bubble in the big stocks.</p>
</details>

现在，如果那些随机的股票能够失去它们的泡沫，而大型股票能够因为盈利增长的合理性而缓慢地继续扩大它们的估值倍数，我认为这是更广泛市场最好的情况之一。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now if those random stocks can lose their froth and the big stocks can slowly continue to expand their multiple because it's justified on earnings growth. I think that's one of the best case scenarios for the broader market.</p>
</details>

但我非常好奇大家怎么看。动量股可能正在失去动力，但它们最终可能会回来。但我们需要更多时间才能看到数据告诉我们什么。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But very curious to hear what people think. Momentum stocks potentially losing their losing their momentum might end up coming back. But we're going to have to give it a lot more time to see what the data tells us.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头动态：OpenAI、谷歌与亚马逊

好的，接下来是亚马逊、谷歌和OpenAI的情况。谷歌盘中跌至245美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, next up is what's going on with Amazon, Google, and OpenAI. So Google fell intraday to 245.</p>
</details>

当市场开盘时我们实际上正在直播。我认为当这发生时，它实际上跌到了244美元。OpenAI宣布了一款名为**Atlas**的新浏览器。当这款浏览器宣布时，每个人都耸了耸肩。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We were actually live when the market open. I think it actually got to 244 when this happened. OpenAI announced a new browser uh called Atlas. And when the browser was announced, everyone shrugged.</p>
</details>

不管怎样，我认为这个浏览器有点意思。我对这款浏览器是否真的重要持怀疑态度。我的意思是，你看，我用Chrome。我确信很多人用Chrome、Safari、Microsoft Edge。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, so the uh you know, the browser I thought was kind of interesting. I'm a bit skeptical on the idea of the browser really mattering. I mean, look, I use Chrome. I'm sure a lot of people use Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这只是其中一件事，对于我们消费者来说，仅仅因为一个侧边栏的AI机器人，你可以根据你所在的网页向它提问，这基本上就是Perplexity推出的功能，我试过它。我喜欢它。它很酷。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean like it's just one of those things where for us to switch to a new browser and when I mean us I mean us as consumers because of some AI bot on the side that you can ask questions to based on whatever web page you're on which is essentially what Perplexity launched and I tried it. I liked it. It was cool.</p>
</details>

但它并没有让我停止使用Chrome。OpenAI的这个东西，我不知道我是否真的会停止使用Chrome，特别是当Chrome也把这个功能添加到他们的浏览器时。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It didn't get me to use stop using Chrome. This OpenAI thing I don't know if I'm going to actually stop using Chrome especially when Chrome adds it to their browser.</p>
</details>

就像我看到一些公司推出的很多这些新创新一样。你看看大型科技公司，你会觉得，天哪，大型科技公司也能做到这一点，而且它们拥有分销渠道，这在世界上是最重要的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like a lot of these new innovations I'm seeing by some of these companies. You look at big tech and you're like man big tech's going to be able to do that and they have the distribution which is the most important thing in the world.</p>
</details>

讽刺的是，Austin今天在聊天中提出了一个很好的观点，Microsoft Bing是一个浏览器，Microsoft Edge，但Bing是微软的搜索工具。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ironically, Austin made a good point in the chat today that Microsoft Bing is a browser, Microsoft Edge, but Bing is like their search thing uh for Microsoft.</p>
</details>

OpenAI没有致力于改进它，也没有与微软互动以利用微软已经拥有的庞大分销渠道，这仅仅意味着OpenAI不关心微软，而且他们与纳德拉（Nadella）的关系可能不像看起来那么好。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that OpenAI is not working on making that better and like interacting with Microsoft to like already serve the distribution that Microsoft has, which is pretty massive, just means that OpenAI doesn't care about Microsoft and this relationship with Nadella might not be as good as it seems in terms of a working relationship.</p>
</details>

所以，他们正在独立行动。谷歌跌到了244美元。谷歌又回升到252美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, they're doing it on their own. Google fell to 244. Google's back up to 252.</p>
</details>

事实上，谷歌在盘后甚至涨得更多，因为彭博社有传言称，Anthropic（一家领先的**大型语言模型**（LLM: Large Language Model）公司）现在将与谷歌合作签订一份云合同，这将涉及数百亿美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, Google's even more green after hours because there is a rumor from Bloomberg that Anthropic, which is one of the leading LLM companies, is now going to be working with Google for a cloud contract which will include tens and tens of billions of dollars.</p>
</details>

这就是我们得到的具体头条新闻。谷歌目前盘后上涨2%，报255.75美元。我认为这非常有趣。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is the exact headline that we have. Google right now after hours is up 2% at 25575. I think that's really interesting.</p>
</details>

其中一个原因之所以有趣，是因为亚马逊已经与谷歌建立了深厚的关系。亚马逊盘后实际上下跌了1.5%。亚马逊当天上涨了近3%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the one of the reasons that's really interesting as well is because Amazon already has a deep relationship with Google. Amazon's actually down one and a half% after hours. Amazon was up almost 3% on the day.</p>
</details>

很多这种泡沫动量股，可能人们获利了结，转投亚马逊这样更安全的股票，但亚马逊盘后下跌，因为Anthropic（亚马逊拥有多数股权，我认为在谷歌的背景下，这几乎是四五亿美元的股权）决定选择谷歌的云服务，而不是**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊网络服务）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a lot of that froth momentum stock potentially, you know, people took profits and got into something safer like an Amazon, but Amazon's down after hours because Anthropic, which they own a majority of, I think a majority of over in the context of Google, it's almost like a four or five billion dollar stake. Um, well, Anthropic is deciding to go with Google for cloud computing over AWS.</p>
</details>

我的看法是什么？我认为有两点。第一，OpenAI浏览器并没有扼杀谷歌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is my take on this? I think two things. Number one, the OpenAI browser is not killing Google.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为谷歌今天跌到244美元对股东来说是一个礼物，我认为那很愚蠢。谷歌股价回升是合理的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think Google going it down to 244 today was a gift for shareholders and I thought that was stupid. Makes sense that Google recovered.</p>
</details>

第二，我认为AWS是一个庞大的业务，从我们昨天看到的AWS中断事件就可以看出。那太疯狂了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, I think AWS is a massive business based on what we saw with the AWS outage yesterday. That was crazy.</p>
</details>

有7600万个网站运行在AWS上，我认为AWS的护城河在2024年7月经历了一次“CrowdStrike时刻”。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">76 million websites run on AWS and I think the moat for AWS had a bit of a crowd strike moment back in July of 2024.</p>
</details>

当某个东西宕机时，每个人都会意识到它在今天有多么难以置信地重要，这也是我认为亚马逊实际上上涨3%的部分原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When something goes down, everyone realizes how unbelievably important it is today, which is part of the reason I think Amazon was actually up 3%.</p>
</details>

然而，亚马逊失去Anthropic，或者从Anthropic那里获得的资金减少，对亚马逊来说并非看跌，因为我认为对于Anthropic、OpenAI、Gemini、XAI所有这些基础模型公司来说，它们正在努力使其云计算和**超大规模服务商**（Hyperscaler: 指提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、GCP）多样化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, it is not bearish for Amazon to lose Anthropic or to not get as much money from Anthropic because I think for Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, XAI, all these foundation model companies, they are trying to diversify the cloud computing and hyperscaler companies that they work with.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，甲骨文（Oracle）、AMD、博通（Broadcom）、英伟达（Nvidia），所有这些公司都在与OpenAI合作。顺便说一句，今天Mazuo出来说，博通那个将为他们带来100亿美元营收的神秘客户，很可能就是Anthropic。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, Oracle, AMD, Broadcom, Nvidia, all of them are working with OpenAI. A ton of them, by the way, Mazuo came out today and said that Broadcom's mystery client that's going to be paying them $10 billion in revenue. That is probably anthropic.</p>
</details>

所以，很多这些公司都在使其云支出多样化。是的，这意味着AWS的营收会减少，这可能对亚马逊网络服务不利，但这并不意味着它们不应该与亚马逊合作。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you've got a lot of these companies diversifying the cloud spend that they do. Yes, that's less revenue going to AWS, which could potentially be bad for Amazon Web Services, but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't be working with Amazon.</p>
</details>

事实上，昨天有一份报告称，Anthropic在过去九个月已经向亚马逊支付了26亿美元，仅仅用于AWS。所以，我不会说这对AWS是看跌的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, there was a report that came out yesterday that said Anthropic has paid Amazon already $2.6 billion in the past nine months just for AWS. So, I wouldn't say it's bearish AWS.</p>
</details>

这只是对谷歌更看涨，因为现在一部分资金将流向谷歌。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just more bullish Google because now some of that money is going to Google.</p>
</details>

现在，关于AWS，我要说的一点是，尽管它们从Anthropic那里获得了大量业务，现在谷歌也可能获得一部分业务。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the one thing about AWS that I will say is that although they're getting a ton of business from Anthropic, and now Google potentially is getting some of that business as well.</p>
</details>

我认为AWS可能会损害亚马逊的盈利，而且我认为如果AWS显示出任何程度的减速，或者第四季度的指引不那么好，股价可能会跌破200美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think AWS could hurt Amazon on earnings, and I think the stock could go down below 200 uh if AWS shows any level of de acceleration or the guidance isn't that good going into Q4.</p>
</details>

为什么第四季度的指引会不好呢？嗯，它们刚刚经历了一次宕机。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why would the guidance not be that good going into Q4? Well, uh they just had an outage.</p>
</details>

现在，我认为他们将不得不向Robinhood（宕机了10小时）、Coinbase、Snapchat、Slack等公司发放的**服务积分**（Service Credits: 云服务提供商在服务中断或未达服务水平协议时向客户提供的补偿或折扣）不应该是一个大问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I think the service credits that they are going to have to give out to a Robin Hood that was down for 10 hours and Coinbase was down and Snapchat was down, Slack was down, etc. That shouldn't be that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，那可能只是亚马逊几千万，甚至几亿美元的开支。那不应该真正影响其底线。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that should be kind of like maybe tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of of an expense for Amazon. That shouldn't really make a difference to the bottom line.</p>
</details>

但是，如果AWS没有加速，或者如果基于这次财报，以及商务、广告等其他业务都平平无奇或不那么令人兴奋，没有加速的潜在希望。是的，我可以看到亚马逊股价暴跌。我真的能看到。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if AWS doesn't accelerate or if there is no potential hope of acceleration based on this earnings uh and the rest of the business around commerce and advertising and all that stuff is just flat or like not that exciting. Yeah, I can see Amazon tanking. I really could.</p>
</details>

我们稍后会谈论Netflix。Netflix暴跌是因为它们未能达到预期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to talk about Netflix in a second. Netflix tank because they couldn't beat their estimates.</p>
</details>

我认为那将是一个买入机会。再次强调，我将亚马逊作为投资组合的基石股票买入。我真的不关心短期会发生什么。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I think that would be a buying opportunity. Again, I'm buying Amazon as a cornerstone stock of the portfolio. I really don't care what happens in the short term.</p>
</details>

十年后，我认为亚马逊将是一家更大的公司。但AWS的加速将有助于股价在财报后上涨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">10 years from now, I think Amazon is going to be much bigger company. But AWS acceleration will help the stock go up after earnings.</p>
</details>

如果我们看到任何程度的平庸表现，你知道，市场希望增长18%。如果它们只达到17.9%或18.1%。如果我们没有真正的超预期表现，我认为股价会持平或下跌，这没关系，因为从长远来看，我认为AWS将是亚马逊一个非常非常重要的业务，而且它不会很快放缓。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we see any level of just like basicness, you know, Street wants 18% growth. They come in at 17.9 or 18.1. If we don't get a real beat, I think the stock is flat or it sells off, which is okay because long term, I think AWS is going to be a very, very important business for Amazon and that's not slowing down anytime soon.</p>
</details>

它可能不会像**GCP**（Google Cloud Platform: 谷歌云平台）或**Azure**（Microsoft Azure: 微软云服务）那样加速。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It just not it might not be accelerating to the level of a GCP or Azure.</p>
</details>

那么问题就来了，我是否应该卖掉亚马逊，买入微软和谷歌？当然。但这会忽略理解亚马逊时所有其他重要因素。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the question then becomes, well, do I sell Amazon and get Microsoft and Google? Sure. It's just that's discounting everything else that is important when it comes to understanding Amazon.</p>
</details>

它也忽略了亚马逊年初至今是下跌的这一事实。谷歌和微软上涨了很多。所以我认为亚马逊的风险回报可能更好。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also discounting the fact that Amazon is red year to date. Google and Microsoft are up a lot. So I think the riskreward might be better on Amazon.</p>
</details>

但话又说回来，这些都是七大科技公司，从理论上讲，无论你未来十年买哪一只，它们都应该表现非常好。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then again, these are max seven companies where whichever one you buy over the next 10 years, theoretically all of them should do really well.</p>
</details>

然而，这是财报季需要关注的事情。AWS需要增长。我们知道AWS有多重要，从昨天导致至少美国一半地区互联网瘫痪的宕机事件就可以看出。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh however, that is something to watch out for going into earnings. AWS needs to grow. We know how important AWS is based on the outage yesterday that shut down half the country, at least in the United States, in regards to the internet.</p>
</details>

很多这些公司和网站根本无法运作。但任何减速，股价都可能在财报前受到冲击。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That simply didn't work for a lot of these companies. and websites, but any de acceleration, the stock could get hit going into earnings.</p>

### Netflix财报分析

好的，Netflix财报，让我们来谈谈。你看，Netflix的财报不是最好的，而且这些财报的结果有点奇怪。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Netflix earnings, let's get into that. Uh, look, Netflix didn't have the best earnings, and it's kind of weird how these earnings turned out.</p>
</details>

如果你在收盘时在线，你会看到对财报的反应。盘后下跌7%。感觉好像是Netflix的个别问题，但这不是最好的情况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you were live on the market close, you saw the reaction to earnings. Uh, down 7% after hours. Kind of feels like it's isolated to Netflix, but it's not the best.</p>
</details>

所以，他们的**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share: 每股普通股所赚取的利润）比预期低了16%。问题是，Netflix为什么会错过得这么严重？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, they missed on EPS by 16%. And the question becomes why did Netflix miss as badly?</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，Capital One、Intuitive Surgical以及许多其他公司都有出色的财报。Chubb Limited Insurance Company表现良好。Texas Instruments的每股收益比预期低1%，营收比预期高2%。但Netflix是这里的主要故事。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, Capital One, Intuitive Surgical, a lot of other companies had a great earnings. Chub Limited Insurance Company, that was good. Texas Instruments missed EPS by 1%, beat revenue by 2%. But Netflix is kind of the main story right here.</p>
</details>

所以，5.87美元对比预期的6.97美元，这就是为什么数字一出来就出现大幅下跌。营收115亿美元，符合市场预期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So 587 versus 697, that's what the street expected. That's why you have that massive move down as soon as the numbers came out. 11.5 billion on revenue. That came in line with the streets expectations.</p>
</details>

那么，Netflix给出的业绩不佳的原因是什么呢？嗯，营业利润率为28%，低于31.5%的指引。这不好，因为它损害了每股收益。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what did Netflix give as the reason for why they had a crappy quarter? Well, operating margin was 28% below the guidance of 31.5%. That's not good because that hurts EPS.</p>
</details>

这就是你看到每股收益不及预期的原因。而这背后的原因是，他们与巴西税务当局之间存在持续的争议，这并未在他们的预测中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and that's why you saw that EPS miss. And then the reason for this is because they had an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities that was not in their forecast.</p>
</details>

所以，Netflix将责任归咎于巴西人，这就是股价下跌的原因。2025年的营业利润率符合第四季度的预期。所以，对于整个财年来说还不错。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Netflix is blaming the Brazilians and that's why the stock is down. Uh, operating margins for 2025 came in line with expectations for Q4. So for the fiscal year it was okay.</p>
</details>

对于第四季度，它比去年同期预期高出2%。但本季度环比下降了5%。这往往是Netflix在第四季度会发生的情况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For Q4 uh it is 2% above year-over-year what is expected. It is down 5% for the quarter quarteron quarter. That tends to be what happens to Netflix in Q4.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，这并不是年底营业利润率的大幅加速。我的看法是，Netflix归根结底是一家卓越的公司。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless it's not like a massive reaceleration in operating margins going into the end of the year. My take on this I mean look Netflix at the end of the day phenomenal company.</p>
</details>

如果你是长期股东，你可能不会太在意，因为Netflix在未来十年会比今天更大。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh if you're a long-term shareholder you probably don't care that much because Netflix over the next 10 years will be a bigger company than it is today.</p>
</details>

我认为Netflix目前面临的更大问题是，嘿，股价年初至今上涨了40%。平台上有数亿订阅用户。Netflix如何实现增长？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the the the broader issue with Netflix, I think, right now, is this idea that, hey, um, look, stocks up 40% here to date. You've got tons and tons of, you know, we're talking about hundreds of millions of subscribers that are on the platform. How does Netflix grow?</p>
</details>

讽刺的是，我们今天早上在市场开盘时讨论的一个故事，以及为什么华纳兄弟探索（Warner Brothers Discovery, WBD）当天上涨了10%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And ironically, one of the stories we talked about in the market open this morning and why WBD, Warner Brothers Discovery, was up 10% of the day.</p>
</details>

据彭博社报道，有传言称Comcast或Netflix正在考虑收购华纳兄弟。那里有一些非常重要的媒体资产，比如HBO Max，很多人已经单独付费订阅，包括我自己，尽管我很少看，所以我不知道我为什么要付费。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are rumors, as per Bloomberg, that Comcast or Netflix is thinking of buying Warner Brothers. And you've got some really important media properties there like HBO Max that a lot of people already pay for separately including myself even though I barely watch it so I don't know why I pay for it.</p>
</details>

但HBO Max可以整合到Netflix中。所以，我认为市场会原谅因巴西税务当局问题导致的每股收益不及预期。这并不是什么大问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but HBO Max could be integrated into Netflix. So I think the EPS miss based on Brazilian tax authorities the street will forgive it. Not that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

股价年初至今上涨了30%或40%，现在是35%。总的来说，它已被证明具有抗衰退能力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stocks up 30% year-to date or 40% year to date now 35%. And overall it has been proven to be recession proof.</p>
</details>

然而，如果我们真的发生衰退，我不知道人们是否会那么快地不取消他们的Netflix或其他流媒体订阅服务提供商，因为内容可能不够好，人们会说：“我不在乎。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, if we do have a recession, I don't know if people are going to be that quick to not cancel their Netflix or other streaming subscription service providers because maybe the content is just not that good enough and people say, "I don't care."</p>
</details>

另一个问题是埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）对Netflix上儿童敏感内容的强烈反弹。我认为“取消你的Netflix”运动始于10月。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other problem is the Elon Musk backlash around sensitive content for kids that has been on Netflix. I think the sort of like cancel your Netflix um movement started in October.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这没有对第三季度产生影响。可能会对第四季度产生影响。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't think that had an impact on Q3. Potentially will have an impact on Q4.</p>
</details>

但是，如果它发生在9月底，而拥有2.5亿粉丝的埃隆·马斯克让人们取消订阅，那对Netflix来说也不是最好的事情。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but if it happened towards the end of September and Elon Musk, who has 250 million followers, got people to unsubscribe, that's not the best thing for Netflix either.</p>
</details>

所以，你看，归根结底，我认为这不是一个让人感到沮丧的季度。我认为这不代表大型科技公司普遍未能达到预期。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, at the end of the day, I don't think this was a quarter that people should be upset about. I don't think this is indicative of big tech in general missing on their earnings.</p>
</details>

如果大型科技公司真的未能达到预期，那将不会很好看。但Netflix似乎是孤立的，因为巴西税务当局的问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If big tech does miss on their earnings, it's not going to be pretty. But Netflix did seems like it was isolated because of Brazilian tax authorities.</p>
</details>

总的来说，我认为Netflix不会有任何更广泛的问题。不过，作为一名内容创作者，我宁愿买谷歌而不是Netflix。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overall, I don't think there's going to be any broader issues with Netflix. I will say though, just as a content creator, I'd rather buy Google over Netflix.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，如果Netflix真的收购华纳兄弟探索，那将是300亿到400亿美元的收购，仅仅是为了获得内容到平台。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if Netflix does acquire Warner Brothers Discovery, that would be a 30 to40 billion dollar acquisition just to get content onto the platform.</p>
</details>

谷歌拥有与受众建立联系的创作者，因此，谷歌实际上不需要为内容付费。谷歌只是创建平台，让人们能够制作内容。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google has creators that connect with audiences, and as a result, Google doesn't really need to pay for the content. Google just creates the platforms that allows people to produce the content.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为两者都是卓越的公司。我不会想以Netflix目前交易的估值倍数来购买，它比英伟达还贵。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think both are phenomenal companies. I would not want to be paying the multiples that Netflix is trading at right now that are more expensive than Nvidia.</p>
</details>

我宁愿直接买谷歌，但从长远来看，我认为这对Netflix来说是“小事一桩”（nothing burger）。这只是一个季度，他们遇到了巴西税务问题，这就是他们未能达到预期的原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would rather just buy Google, but long term, I think this is a nothing burger for Netflix. It's just one of those quarters where they had a Brazilian tax issue and that's why they missed on earnings.</p>
</details>

### 黄金市场剧烈波动

好的，我们今天要谈的最后一件事是黄金的情况。黄金今天遭受了相当严重的打击，下跌了约1.3%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, last thing we're going to talk about today is what is going on with gold. Gold took a pretty ugly hit on the day, down about 1.3%.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，看，或者抱歉，不是下跌1.3%。下跌幅度比那多一点。当天大约下跌了5%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I mean, look, or sorry, not down 1.3%. Down a little bit more than that. Down about 5% on the day.</p>
</details>

所以，这是对聊天中每个人的问题。这是黄金自2013年4月以来最糟糕的一天。市值损失了1.75万亿美元。黄金是泡沫吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, here's the question to everyone in the chat. Uh, this was the worst day for gold since April 2013. Lost $1.75 trillion in market cap. Is gold a bubble?</p>
</details>

我犹豫着说它是泡沫。我认为它变得过于拥挤，而且我认为今天这种过度拥挤的交易泡沫有点消散了，这可能看涨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hesitate to say it's a bubble. I think it is getting overcrowded and I think some of that frothiness of the overcrowdedness of the trade kind of left today, which is probably bullish.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，白银下跌了7%。所以，白银和黄金都受到了打击。我要说的是，我们上周看了一张图表，显示全球所有央行现在有20%的储备是黄金。黄金正被当作美国国债来对待。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Silver, by the way, down 7%. So, silver and gold both took it on the chin. I will say that we looked at a chart last week that said central banks are now having 20% of their reserves, 20% of all central banks globally in gold. Gold is being treated like US treasuries.</p>
</details>

而且因为美元正在下跌，你知道，你可能会说人们正在用黄金作为对冲。现在，十年期国债下跌很奇怪，因为这意味着人们没有预期通货膨胀。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And because the dollar is going down, you know, you might be saying people are using gold as a hedge. Now again, the 10ear going down is weird because that means people are not anticipating inflation.</p>
</details>

黄金同时上涨又很奇怪，因为人们正在预期通货膨胀。那么为什么会发生这种情况呢？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Gold going up at the same time is again weird because people are anticipating inflation. So why is that happening?</p>
</details>

你可以提出的一个论点是，从地缘政治角度来看，黄金今天受到冲击的原因是中东地区因以色列-哈马斯协议而出现了一些和平。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One argument you can make is that geopolitically the reason gold took a hit today is because there is a bit more peace in the Middle East with the Israel Hamas deal.</p>
</details>

俄罗斯和乌克兰周围也可能出现一些和平。如果这种地缘政治不稳定开始转变为稳定（过去两年我们并没有太多稳定），这也可以解释黄金今年70%的大幅上涨。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There might be some peace around Russia Ukraine. And if that geopolitical instability starts turning into stability, which really over the past two years we haven't had that much stability and that could also explain the massive 70% move that gold has had this year.</p>
</details>

如果这种情况开始变得更加稳定，那对黄金来说可能不会那么糟糕，或者说不会那么好，这最终会导致价格走势向下，变得更难看。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If that starts to become more stable, it might not be that bad for gold or it might not be that good for gold, which ends up becoming more ugly, you know, to the downside in terms of price action.</p>
</details>

另一个说法是散户狂热。我不知道。我认为我上周三在每日回顾中问过这个问题：有多少人在投资黄金？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other narrative here is retail euphoria. I don't know. And I think I asked this question on a daily recap on Wednesday last week. How many people are in gold?</p>
</details>

你知道，我认为你们中5%的人在评论中说你们投资了黄金，但我们大多数人都没有投资黄金。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, I think 5% of you in the comments said you're in gold, but the majority of us are not in gold.</p>
</details>

讽刺的是，比特币今天上涨了2%。所以，也许是从实物黄金转向数字黄金的轮动。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ironically, Bitcoin was up 2% today. So, maybe there was a rotation out of physical gold to digital gold.</p>
</details>

所以，我的看法是，我不会碰这个交易，因为我认为犯错的风险，以及进入一个非常拥挤的交易，现在可能面临底部崩塌的风险，这并不意味着黄金必须下跌30%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, my take here is that I would not touch this trade because I think the risk of being wrong and entering into a very crowded trade that is now going to have the bottom potentially fall out, which doesn't mean gold has to go down 30%.</p>
</details>

但如果黄金再下跌5%，你会看到很多人会想：“我当初为什么要投资这个？”你可能会看到更敏感的抛售价格行为。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if gold goes down another 5%, you're going to get a lot of people that are like, h, why am I in this in the first place and you might have more sensitive price pricing action in terms of the selling.</p>
</details>

但是，如果央行逢低买入黄金（如果他们认为黄金比美元更好，这并非不可能），那么黄金可能会回到5000美元。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if central banks buy the dip on gold, which is possible if they're thinking of gold is better than the dollar, then maybe gold's going back to 5,000.</p>
</details>

我认为除非你对大宗商品有复杂的理解，否则很难在这里做出预测。白银今天下跌7%也不是最好的情况。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's really hard to make the prediction right here unless you have a sophisticated understanding of commodities. Silver going down 7% today also wasn't the best.</p>
</details>

但是，因为我对大宗商品没有那么复杂的看法，而且我不愿意冒险去投资一个年初至今上涨了70%的东西（黄金从来不会一年上涨70%），我不会在这些水平跳入。

<p class="english-text">Um, but because I don't have that really sophisticated view of commodities, and because I'm not willing to take a chance on something that's up 70% year to date, that never goes up 70% year to date. Like that doesn't happen for gold. I'm not willing to jump in at these levels.</p>

讽刺的是，我宁愿买比特币。你知道，我觉得它更像是一种对货币贬值的对冲。

<p class="english-text">Ironically, I would I I would actually rather buy Bitcoin. You know, I feel like it's a little bit more of a hedge against currency debasement.</p>

因此，比特币今年只上涨了15-20%，而黄金却上涨了这么多。也许它最终会成为一个更好的机会。
<details>

<p class="english-text">And as a result, Bitcoin only moving up 15 20% this year versus gold. Maybe it be ends up becoming a better opportunity.</p>
</details>

但归根结底，黄金的走势不容小觑。在上涨了65%之后，今天下跌5%的走势让你不禁想，就像我们节目开头谈到的那些高动量股票一样，这是结构性的下跌还是暂时的喘息？
<details>

<p class="english-text">But at the end of the day, the move in gold can't be understated. losing a 5% rally or or losing a 5% um uh move on today's price action after a 65% rally makes you wonder just like the high momentum stocks we talked about at the beginning of the show is it structural or is it a breather?</p>
</details>

我认为我们需要更多数据才能看清，但如果是结构性的，那么很多资金可能会流出这个资产类别，然后问题就变成了这些资金会流向哪里？货币市场基金？标普500？英伟达？谷歌？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we need some more data to see but if it is structural then you might have a lot of that money exiting into the asset class and then the question becomes where does that money go money market funds S&P 500 Nvidia Google that is the broader question.</p>
</details>

这才是更广泛的问题。但看起来一些动量正在受到冲击。所以，我认为在接下来的几周里，问题是黄金能否重新站稳脚跟？这是逢低买入的机会吗？央行会介入吗？散户会逢低买入吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it does seem like some of that momentum is getting hit. And so I think over the next couple weeks, the question is, can gold regain the footing? Is this a buy the dip? Do central banks come in? Does retail come in to buy the dip or is this one of those things where look, it had a good run and it's going to chill out, consolidate for a bit?</p>
</details>

还是说，它只是经历了一波不错的上涨，现在要冷静下来，盘整一段时间？也许它会横盘整理。它不必暴跌20%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe it goes sideways. It doesn't have to tank 20%.</p>
</details>

但它也不必再上涨20%。这对黄金来说也不是世界上最糟糕的事情。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it doesn't have to go back up 20%. And that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for gold.</p>

说实话，我有点爱上了文字艺术。我从没想过自己会真正投入写作，但我想在说了四年之后，我需要一个新的挑战，一种表达我的想法和观点的媒介。

<p class="english-text">Uh I have kind of fallen in love, I'm not going to lie, with the art of written word. I never thought I would really get into writing, but I think after four years of talking, I needed a new challenge for a medium to express my thoughts and ideas.</p>
