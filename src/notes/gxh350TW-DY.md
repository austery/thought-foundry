### 东亚“白瘦幼”审美与可爱文化的深层探讨

在之前的视频中，我们通过分析日本动漫中的经典角色“战斗少女”，指出了其人格的空洞与不真实性，这使得她们非常适合作为观众进行性投射的对象。在视频的最后，我们也提到，“战斗少女”以及**ACGN**（Animation, Comic, Game, Novel: 动漫、漫画、游戏、小说构成的文化圈）文化本身并非问题所在，关键在于当事者对待这一角色的态度。因此，在今天的视频中，我们将进一步探讨东亚社会中的**白瘦幼**（白瘦幼: 指追求皮肤白皙、身材纤细、外表幼态的审美标准）审美及其背后的可爱文化。在视频开始前，我想说明，我将把这个视频发布到“心理学与教育”的列表中。如果您有任何想与我讨论的咨询话题，可以通过我的邮箱预约。现在，让我们回到今天的话题。

<p class="english-text">In the previous video, we used Japanese anime to analyze the classic character Battle Girl, pointing out the hollowness and unreality of her personality, which makes her suitable as an object for the audience's sexual projection. At the end of that video, we also mentioned that Battle Girls and ACGN culture itself are not the problem; the key lies in the attitude of the parties towards this role. So, in today's video, let's discuss this further: the aesthetic of white, thin, and young in East Asian society and the cute culture behind it. Before the video starts, let me mention that I will post this video in the "Psychology and Education" list. If you have anything you want to discuss with me or consultation topics, you can contact my email to make an appointment. Now, let's get back to today's topic.</p>

### 表象之下：精神不成熟的迷恋

从表面上看，我们所说的“白瘦幼”审美指的是一套相当标准化的身体特征：白皙的皮肤象征着纯洁无瑕；纤细的身材意味着苗条且不具攻击性，能够唤起人们的保护欲；而幼态的容貌和身体则直接暗示着一种天真、顺从、不成熟的身心状态。然而，真正重要的并非外表，而是精神，因为外表仅仅是精神的一种外化。我们所欣赏的，绝不是他人孤立的身体特征，而是这些特征作为能指和符号，所承载的精神意义。这些意义通常受到社会文化的影响，是个人经验反复编码的结果。因此，当我们认为一个人的外表美丽时，实际上是在无意识地将这个人的外表当作她内在情感的载体。外表是**能指**（Signifier: 索绪尔语言学中的术语，指符号的物质形式，如词语的声音或图像），即可见的符号，而它所代表的内在情感和品质则是**所指**（Signified: 索绪尔语言学中的术语，指符号所代表的概念或意义），即符号的意义。“白瘦幼”之所以能成为一种强大的审美范式，并非某种刻在基因里的本能，它与整个文化数百年乃至数千年的塑造，以及近几十年来爆炸式增长的文化产业的重复编码密不可分。也就是说，在“白瘦幼”这一能指与“纯洁、天真、简单”这一所指之间，建立了一条相当稳固的联想路径。所以我们说，“白瘦幼”审美真正意味着什么？它是一种对精神不成熟和弱小的迷恋。

<p class="english-text">On the surface, the so-called "white, thin, and young" aesthetic refers to a fairly standardized set of physical characteristics: fair skin symbolizes purity and being unpolluted; a thin figure means being slender and non-aggressive, arousing people's desire to protect; and a youthful appearance and body directly imply a naive, submissive, and immature state of mind and body. However, appearances aren't what really matter, but rather the spirit, as appearance is merely an externalization of the spirit. What we appreciate is never the isolated physical characteristics of another person; instead, these characteristics serve as signs and symbols for the spiritual meaning behind them. These meanings are usually influenced by social culture and are the results of repeated coding of personal experiences. Therefore, when we think a person's appearance is beautiful, we are unconsciously treating this person's appearance as a shell for her inner feelings. Appearance is a Signifier, that is, visible symbols, while the inner emotions and qualities it represents are the Signified, which is the meaning of the symbol. The reason why "white, thin, and young" can become a powerful aesthetic paradigm is not some instinct engraved in genes; rather, it is inseparable from the shaping by the entire culture for hundreds and thousands of years, and in recent decades, the repetitive coding of the exploding cultural industry. That is, a fairly solid associative pathway has been established between the signifier "white, thin, and young" and the referent "pure, innocent, simple." So, what does the white, thin, and young aesthetic really mean? It is an obsession with spiritual immaturity and weakness.</p>

一个典型的案例是日本偶像团体**AKB48**（日本偶像团体: 以“可以面对面的偶像”为理念，通过剧场公演和握手会等形式拉近与粉丝距离）。她们的成功很大程度上是基于这种“精神幼稚性”的创造和销售。在经济下行时期，人们的消费观念也变得更加保守。AKB48的定位是“可以面对面的偶像”，就像邻家女孩一样，承载着一种成长叙事。她们的可爱和亲近感成为了**御宅族**（otaku: 源于日本，指热衷于动漫、游戏等次文化并深入研究的人群）的精神慰藉。这种定位本身拉近了偶像与粉丝的距离，削弱了传统明星遥不可及的光环，取而代之的是一种“可爱”且触手可及的亲近感。粉丝们见证了一群外貌和才华并非顶尖的普通女孩，如何通过自身的“努力”、“汗水”和“笨拙”一步步走向舞台中央。粉丝的消费，恰恰是她们的不完美和未完成状态。为了维持这种“未完成”的纯洁感，她们甚至有严格的恋爱禁止规定。例如，在2013年，一位成员因被发现与另一位艺人恋爱，不得不剃头谢罪。这条规定本质上是一种制度化的、人为延长她们精神不成熟的方式，确保她们在粉丝面前，永远是那个为梦想奋斗、情感上“忠诚”于粉丝的清纯女孩，而非拥有复杂个人情感生活的成熟女性。她们的行为、言语和舞台表现，都在不断强化这种天真、努力甚至有些鲁莽的“人设”。这让我们更清晰地看到了“白瘦幼”的本质：它所迷恋的不仅仅是身体特征，而是一种不成熟的心智，一个精神上被动和依赖的对象。

<p class="english-text">A typical case is the Japanese idol group AKB48. Their success is largely based on the creation and sale of this "mental childishness." In times of economic downturn, people's consumption concepts also become more conservative. AKB48's positioning is that of an idol you can meet, like the girl next door, embodying a coming-of-age narrative. Their cuteness and intimacy became the spiritual salvation of otaku. This positioning itself brought idols and fans closer together, weakening the traditional beauty of stars that felt out of reach, replacing it with a "cute" and accessible feeling of intimacy. Fans witnessed a group of ordinary girls, whose appearance and talents were not top-notch, achieve success through their own "hard work," "sweat," and "clumsiness," step by step to the center of the stage. Fans' consumption is precisely their imperfection and unfinished state. In order to maintain this sense of "unfinished" purity, they also have strict rules prohibiting dating. For example, in 2013, a member, because she was found to be in a relationship with another artist, had to shave her head to apologize. This rule is essentially an institutionalized way of artificially prolonging their mental immaturity, ensuring they are always, in front of the fans, an innocent girl who fights for her dream and is emotionally " loyal" to her fans, rather than a mature woman with complex personal emotional lives. Their behavior, speech, and stage performance constantly strengthen this naive, effortful, and even somewhat reckless "personality." This allows us to see more clearly the essence of "white, thin, and young": it is not just the physical characteristics that it is obsessed with, but an immature mind, an object that is mentally passive and dependent.</p>

### 反例与对比：复杂与扁平的角色

让我们回顾一下关于“钢卷少女”的有趣评论。例如，有人评论说，如果她害羞了，扇她一巴掌怎么样？这种幻想并非是体验被超能力者攻击的危险，而是这种互动反映了她的娇嗔和羞涩。另一条评论说：“如果这样的女孩要300万彩礼，我二话不说。”这是将对方视为一个待价而沽或待领养的物品。拥有超能力并不能改变她们精神上的单纯、被动和幼稚。另一方面，如果一个人仅仅是外表白瘦幼，但她是一个非常复杂而强大的女性，那么这种可爱感就不那么容易投射了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's review interesting comments about Steel Roll Girl. For example, someone commented that if she gets shy, how about a slap in the face? This fantasy is not about experiencing the danger of being attacked by a superpowered being; rather, this interaction reflects her coquettishness and shyness. Another comment said, "I wouldn't say a word if a girl like this asked for 3 million yuan in betrothal gifts." This is to regard the other party as an item waiting to be appraised or adopted. Possessing superpowers does not change their spiritual simplicity, passivity, and naivety. On the other hand, if a person is only white, thin, and young in appearance but is a very complex and strong woman, it's not so easy to project this kind of cuteness.</p>
</details>

一个反例是游戏《**红色警戒3**》（Red Alert 3: 一款即时战略游戏，由EA开发）中日本阵营的英雄单位**百合子**（Yuriko: 游戏《红色警戒3》中日本阵营的英雄单位）。**EA**（Electronic Arts: 美国一家著名的电子游戏开发和发行公司）为了迎合东亚玩家的审美，创造了这样一个双马尾、穿着日式短裙校服的超能力美少女。然而，他们仅仅是复制了日式战斗少女的外表，却为这个角色设计了一段极其悲惨和创伤性的历史。在游戏中，百合子自幼被孤立，后被日本政府发现并进行残酷的人体实验，最终被塑造成帝国的终极武器。因此，她对实验者怀有巨大的仇恨，眼神中充满了攻击性和诡异的情绪。这使得角色非常立体，但也非常沉重，甚至令人恐惧，难以投射可爱的感情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A counterexample is Yuriko, a hero unit of the Japanese faction in the game Red Alert 3. EA, catering to the aesthetics of East Asian players, created a double-ponytail, superpowered beautiful girl wearing a Japanese short-skirt school uniform. However, they just copied the appearance of a Japanese fighting girl but designed an extremely tragic and traumatic history for this role. In the game, Yuriko was isolated since childhood, later discovered by the Japanese government, and subjected to cruel human experiments, eventually being shaped into the empire's ultimate weapon. So, she harbored a huge hatred for the experimenters, and her eyes were full of aggression and weird emotions. This makes the character very three-dimensional, but it's also very heavy, even scary, making it difficult to project cute emotions onto her.</p>
</details>

正如我们在上一个视频中提到的，日本战斗少女的魅力，恰恰在于她们被刻意剥离了创伤。她们没有复杂的精神成长史，内心空虚，自我意识也未被唤醒，如此一来，粉丝才能将可爱的感情投射到她们身上。而东亚的战斗少女，即使被赋予某种创伤，这种创伤通常也不会构成她们人格发展的驱动力，而是被审美化和诗意化，成为唤起玩家爱怜和同情情感的工具，仅仅是一种点缀，缺乏灵魂的深度。那么，她们的超能力从何而来呢？这只能归因于神秘道具的馈赠，或是命运的安排。原因可以非常简单，甚至无需逻辑，因为这并不重要。她们想要保护或恢复的，也是那种田园牧歌式的和谐集体。在美国，或者说在西方创作者看来，一个极其强大却没有历史、没有痛苦、没有挣扎的角色，是扁平而不真实的。超能力本身就是一种异常状态，而一个在集体中处于未分化自我意识状态的人，其内心是静止的，因此也缺乏打破常规的欲望和冲动。对超能力或力量的渴望，往往源于对创伤的补偿：“因为我曾如此弱小和孤独，所以我必须变得强大。”这种渴望背后，总伴随着某种痛苦、挣扎等人类情感。因此，百合子这个角色恰恰反映出美国创作者不擅长，或者说不理解这种“白瘦幼”审美。他们似乎在试图迎合这种审美，但仍然为这个角色植入了一个强大的主体性和怨恨的灵魂。尽管这使得这个角色更加真实和富有层次，但从产品设计的角度来看，这恰恰与东亚的可爱文化背道而驰。

<p class="english-text">As we said in the previous video, the charm of Japanese fighting girls is precisely because they are deliberately stripped of their trauma. They don't have a complicated spiritual growth history; their hearts are empty, and their self-awareness is not awakened. Only then can fans project their cute emotions onto them. And for the fighting girls of East Asia, even if given some kind of trauma, this trauma usually does not constitute the driving force of their personality development. Instead, it is aestheticized and poeticized, serving as a way to evoke players' love and tools for compassionate feelings—just an embellishment, lacking soul depth. So, where do their superpowers come from? This can only be attributed to the gift of mysterious props or fate's arrangement. The reason can be very simple, there's not even logic, because it's not important. What they want to protect or restore is also the kind of idyllic and harmonious collective. In the United States, or in the eyes of Western creators, an extremely powerful character with no history, no pain, and no struggles is flat and unreal. Superpowers themselves are an abnormal state, and a person in an undifferentiated state of self-awareness within a collective has a still heart. Thus, they also lack the desire and impulse to break the routine. The desire for superpowers or power often comes from compensation for trauma: "Because I was so weak and lonely, so I have to become strong." Behind this desire, there is always some kind of pain, struggle, and other human emotions. Therefore, the character of Yuriko just reflects that American creators are not good at, or perhaps don't understand, this kind of white, thin, and young aesthetic. They seem to be trying to cater to this aesthetic but still instilled in this role a powerful subjectivity and a resentful soul. Although it makes this character more real and layered, from the perspective of product design, this is exactly contrary to the cute culture of East Asia.</p>

### 可爱文化的深层动机与健康回归

所以在这里，我想强调的是，欣赏那些幼稚、不成熟、笨拙和可爱的事物本身并不是问题。例如，当我们看到可爱的小猫小狗时，就想去亲近和抚摸。又例如，当两个人处于亲密交流中，彼此放松个人边界时，他们会开始表现出孩子气，互相取可爱的昵称，撒娇卖萌。这些都是非常美好和有趣的情感。甚至可以说，如果一段关系中不存在这些，那意味着这段关系不够亲密、不够深入、不够放松。健康的退行能够让我们感受到被承载，感受到深度的联结和疗愈，进而也能激发生命的活力和创造力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, here I want to emphasize that appreciating things that are childish, immature, clumsy, and cute is not a problem in itself. For example, when we see cute kittens and puppies, we just want to get close and touch them. For another example, when two people are in intimate communication, relaxing each other's personal boundaries, they begin to behave in a childish manner, giving each other cute nicknames and acting cute. These are all very beautiful and interesting emotions. It can even be said that if these things are not present in a relationship, that means the relationship is not intimate, deep, or relaxing enough. Healthy regression allows us to feel held, feel deeply connected, and healed, and then it can also stimulate vitality and creativity in life.</p>
</details>

然而，我们在这里要关注和讨论的，是欣赏幼稚和可爱背后的动机。如果一个人只能，或者主要是从对方的不成熟、可爱和天真中获得美好的感受，却不能或很少能欣赏和仰慕另一个人的强大、成熟、神秘和独立的一面，那么这种对可爱的欣赏，就可能成为当事人逃避和防御成长的工具。我们说，任何一个人，无论她的思想和人格多么成熟和独立，在她的性格中，都必然存在一个孩子气、天真烂漫的一面。人类的成长和发展从来都不是线性的，它不是对前一个阶段自我的彻底斩断，毫无残留地进入下一个阶段，而是在对前一个阶段的否定和整合的基础上，包含着前一个阶段的智慧，螺旋式上升地进入下一个阶段。从这个意义上说，一个人当然可以永远在自己内心的某个角落，保留一份单纯和天真，一份怀旧和悲伤的情绪。然而，当个体未能发展出对强大和独立的审美偏好，当一个人的情感固着在笨拙、可怜、可爱的客体上时，这可能反映出他在成长中遭遇了一些困难。事实上，任何一种文化都可能被单向度地发展成一种逃避和防御的工具。一些年轻人习惯沉浸在可爱文化中，他们喜欢婴儿化的事物，也喜欢扮演孩子的角色。而在中国社会，一些中老年人可能更习惯另一种逃避方式，那就是通过所谓的宏大叙事、帝王视角进行整合，通过假装与历史进程合拍，与国家权力合一，来隔绝和回避自己真实的情感，扮演一个所谓的深刻和成熟。因此，我们并非在批判“白瘦幼”审美，而是想通过分析它，去触碰和连接那颗深层寻求稳定和控制的内心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, what we are going to focus on and discuss here is the motivation behind appreciating childishness and cuteness. If a person can only, or mainly, find a beautiful feeling in the other party's immaturity, cuteness, and innocence, but cannot or rarely appreciates and admires another person's strength, maturity, mysterious, and independent side, then this appreciation of cuteness may become the client's tool for escape and defense against growth. We say that anyone, no matter how mature and independent their thoughts and personalities are, must have a childish, innocent side in their character. Human growth and development never follow a linear order; it is not a complete severance of the previous stage of self to enter the next stage without any residue. Instead, it is based on the negation and integration of the previous stage, containing the wisdom of the previous stage, and entering the next stage in a spiraling upward manner. In this sense, a person can, of course, always keep a simple and innocent, nostalgic, and sad emotion in a corner of their heart. However, when individuals fail to develop an aesthetic preference for being strong and independent, when a person's emotions are fixed on clumsy, pitiful, cute objects, this may reflect that they encountered some difficulties in their growth. In fact, any culture can be unilaterally developed into a tool of escape and defense. Some young people are accustomed to being immersed in cute culture; they like baby things and also like to play the role of a child. In Chinese society, some middle-aged and elderly people may be more accustomed to another way of escape, which is through the so-called big picture, integrating with the emperor's perspective. By pretending to be in harmony with the historical process and merging with state power, they isolate and avoid their true emotions, playing a so-called profound and mature role. Therefore, we are not criticizing the aesthetics of white, thin, and young, but want to analyze it to touch and connect that deep heart seeking stability and control.</p>

### “可爱”的文化基因：日本的独特演变

然而一个有趣的问题产生了：如果对单纯和天真的喜爱是人类普遍的心理，为何这种审美偏好在东亚，或者说在日本，能够发展出如此独特而系统化，甚至席卷全球的文化产业？日本在这方面积累了怎样的历史遗产和土壤，才能孕育出如此独特的可爱文化？要回答这个问题，我们需要从语言的角度，追溯这种文化的基因。正如学者**四方田犬彦**（Shihoda Inuhiko: 日本电影学者、比较文学者）在他的著作《**かわいさについて**》（On Cuteness: 一本探讨日本“可爱”文化起源与演变的著作）中所研究的，“可爱”这个词（**かわいい**，kawaii: 日语中形容可爱、惹人怜爱的词）在历史上经历了一个复杂的演变。它可以追溯到 *Kahayushi* 或 *Kahohayushi*，后者描述的是那些看起来更鲜艳的事物，也意味着气色更好，因兴奋、害羞或尴尬而脸红。这已经暗示了我们今天所说的“可爱”的内涵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But an interesting question arises: if the love for simplicity and innocence is a universal human psychology, why has this aesthetic preference in East Asia, or specifically in Japan, developed into such a unique and systematic cultural industry that is even sweeping the world? What kind of historical heritage and soil has Japan accumulated in this regard to nurture such a unique cute culture? To answer this question, we need to look at it from the perspective of language, tracing the genes of this culture. As scholar Shihoda Inuhiko researches in his book "On Cuteness," the word "cute" (kawaii) has undergone a complex evolution in history. It can be traced back to Kahayushi or Kahohayushi, the latter describing things that appear more colorful, also meaning that the complexion looks better, blushing due to excitement, shyness, or embarrassment. This already implies what we call "cute" today—a cute connotation.</p>
</details>

在11世纪早期，**清少納言**（Sei Shonagon: 日本平安时代女作家，著有《枕草子》）在她的随笔集《**枕草子**》（The Pillow Book: 日本平安时代随笔集，描绘宫廷生活和自然景物）中，以一种非常细腻和敏感的视角，描述了孩童天真的玩耍：一只小麻雀跳过孩子的脸庞，一个三岁的孩子看到地上一个小物件，用它的小手指捡起来给大人看，或者女孩将头发从眼前拨开。当我们感受这些画面时，确实能感受到一种非常日式的审美。在这里，所有这些被称为“可爱”的事物，都是幼小、脆弱、天真且需要被照护的。然而，在12世纪的《**今昔物語集**》（Konjaku Monogatarishu: 日本平安时代末期的民间故事集）中，文献记载这个词在句子中的含义已经是“可怕、可怜、值得同情”。这与我们今天许多人的想法相悖，今天人们觉得“可爱”这个词意味着“令人愉悦”或“漂亮”。但它的基因中却包含着怜悯、不忍、同情的含义。这似乎是一个很大的反差，但当我们使用“可爱”这个词时，仔细斟酌和品味，其实自然会感受到一丝淡淡的悲伤。可爱文化欣赏那些纤细、脆弱、短命的事物，例如樱花、落叶、小猫、笨拙的孩子。它的逻辑是这样的：主体首先感受到客观事物的美，然后联想到这个事物的脆弱和有意识，接着感到怜悯、同情和悲伤，再因为这种悲伤，而产生一种微妙的怜惜之美。循环往复，这种美感也随之加深。这便是可爱审美与**物哀**（mono no aware: 日本传统审美观念，指对世间万物无常变化的感叹，以及由此产生的淡淡的哀愁和怜惜之情）美学的共通之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the early eleventh century, Sei Shonagon in her essay The Pillow Book with a very delicate and sensitive perspective, describes the innocent play of children: a little sparrow jumping over a child's face, a three-year-old child seeing a small object on the ground and using its small fingers to pick it up and show it to adults, or a girl pushing her hair away from her eyes. When we feel this picture, indeed, you can feel a very Japanese aesthetic. Here, all these things called "cute" are young, fragile, innocent, and in need of care. However, it has already been recorded in the literature, specifically in the 12th-century Konjaku Monogatarishu, that the meaning of this word in a sentence is "terrible, poor, worthy of sympathy." This is contrary to what many of us think today, where people feel the word "cute" means "pleasing" or "pretty." But its genes contain meanings of pity, intolerance, and sympathy. This seems like a big contrast, but when we carefully consider and savor the word "cute," it is natural to feel a touch of sadness. Cute culture appreciates those who are slender, fragile, short-lived objects, such as cherry blossoms, fallen leaves, kittens, or clumsy children. Its logic is this: the subject first feels the beauty of the objective object, then thinks of the fragility and consciousness of this object, then feels pity, sympathy, and sadness, and then because of this sadness, produces a subtle sense of beauty of pity. The cycle continues, and this sense of beauty is deepened. This is the commonality between cute aesthetics and mono no aware aesthetics.</p>
</details>

这种视角在日本文化中有着悠久而深厚的传承。正如作者所总结的，可爱审美是关于从幼小、脆弱、需要他人保护的事物中，逐渐从他人身上向自身涌现出的美。当我们对比其他民族的文化时，更能感受到日本可爱文化的特殊之处。一个词语的独特性，最能体现在翻译中。当你发现一个词语很难在另一种语言中找到完美对应的词时，这意味着它承载着这种文化独特的内涵。例如，日语的“かわいい”常被翻译成英文的“cute”，但英文词“cute”的基因与“かわいい”不同。我们说，“かわいい”这个词实际上有着可怜、不忍、同情和羞涩的词源。而“Cute”的词源可以追溯到拉丁语**Acutus**（拉丁语: 意为“尖锐的、聪明的”），这个词意为尖锐的、有角的、聪明的、机灵的、精明的。“Cute”直到18世纪才出现，其最初的含义是“精明和聪明”。19世纪以后，它才被用来形容儿童和小动物的可爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Such a perspective has a long and profound heritage in Japanese culture. As the author concludes, cute aesthetics is about emotions arising from small, fragile things that need protection from others, gradually emerging as beauty from others to oneself. When we compare the culture of other nations, you can feel more what's special about Japanese cute culture. The uniqueness of a word is best reflected in translation. When you find a word that is difficult to find a perfect equivalent in another language, this means that it carries the unique connotation of this culture. For example, かわいい is often translated into "cute" in English, but the genes of the English word "cute" are different from those of かわいい. We said the word かわいい actually has the following etymologies: pitiful, meaning of intolerance, sympathy, and shyness. The etymology of "Cute" can be traced back to the Latin Acutus, which means sharp, pointed, intelligent, clever, shrewd. "Cute" did not appear until the 18th century, and its original meaning was "clever and clever." After the 19th century, it was used to describe the cuteness of children and small animals.</p>
</details>

相比之下，日语的“かわいい”没有聪明、机灵、智慧的含义。在英语中，形容一个成年女性“cute”，通常带有娇小、轻盈、友善、美丽但不具威胁性的意味，而“beautiful”或“elegant”则是更高级和庄重的赞美。在法语中，甚至找不到一个对应的“cute”的词。正如作者所总结的，在日本，如果你称赞一个女性“美丽”，对方可能会感到害羞和不知所措，她们也可能认为你在开玩笑或不够真诚。但如果你称赞她“可爱”，她很可能会欣然接受，并认为这是发自内心的愉悦赞美。这种社会场景的差异揭示了一个重要的事实：在当代日本语境中，“可爱”往往超越了“美丽”。它不再是一个次要的、只适用于儿童的形容词，反而成为了一种更受欢迎和亲密，甚至是最高形式的赞美。这种将“可爱”置于“美丽”之上，或者至少是与之并驾齐驱的价值排序，也使我们能够理解“白瘦幼”审美为何能在日本达到如此极致的形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In contrast, the Japanese かわいい does not contain the meanings of clever, smart, or intelligent. Describing an adult woman in English as "cute" often implies small, light, friendly, and beautiful, but not threatening, whereas "beautiful" or "elegant" is a more advanced and solemn compliment. In French, one can't even find a word for "cute." As the author concludes, in Japan, if you praise a woman as "beautiful," the other person may feel shy and overwhelmed; they may also think you are joking or not sincere enough. But if you praise her for being "cute," she will probably accept it happily and think it comes from the heart as pleasant compliments. The difference in this social scene reveals an important fact: in the context of contemporary Japan, cuteness often surpasses beauty. It is no longer a second-rate adjective that applies only to children; instead, it has become a more popular and intimate, even the highest form of praise. This kind of putting "cute" above "beautiful," or at least a value ranking that is on par with it, also enables us to understand why the "white, thin, and young" aesthetic can reach such an extreme form in Japan.</p>
</details>

### 超越“可爱”与“美丽”：整合的视角

那么在这里，有些朋友可能会问：我们应该抵制和否定这种可爱文化，或者说是“白瘦幼”审美吗？我认为答案既不是拥抱，也不是抵抗，而是“整合”。正如我们之前所说，一个真正成熟的自我，恰恰是能够整合其所有部分，她自我的任何一部分都没有被抛弃，都能得到充分的发展和认可。这当然也包括内心那个天真烂漫、渴望被承载的“孩子”自我。真正的问题，或许不在于我们是否喜欢或抵制可爱，而在于我们是否还拥有爱“不可爱”的能力。我们是否还有勇气去拥抱一个真实、不完美、充满未知和挑战的他人？能否欣赏那种被痛苦和挣扎所磨砺出的，带有粗糙质感的成熟之美？我们将在下个视频中继续深入探讨这个话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here, some friends may ask: should we resist and deny this cute culture or the aesthetic of white, thin, and young? I think the answer is neither embracing nor resisting, but "integration." As we said before, a truly mature self is precisely one that can integrate all its parts, where no part of her self is abandoned, and all can be fully developed and recognized. This, of course, also includes the inner, innocent "child" self that longs to be held. The real problem, perhaps, is not whether we like or resist cuteness, but whether we still have the ability to love the "unlovable." Do we still have the courage to embrace real, imperfect others, full of unknowns and challenges? Can we appreciate the kind of mature beauty with a rough texture, tempered by pain and struggle? We will continue to delve deeper into this topic in the next video.</p>
