### 德国科技人才流失与经济停滞

德国，这个汽车工业的强国、欧洲的工程奇迹，正以惊人的速度流失科技人才。当社交媒体关注美国科技公司裁员时，德国仅在2024年就失去了超过12,000个工作岗位。欧洲的经济引擎正在停滞，制造业已连续两年下滑。那么，究竟发生了什么？为什么人才正涌向东方和南方？最重要的是，这对当今的科技职业意味着什么？

<p class="english-text">Germany, the automotive powerhouse, the engineering marvel of Europe, is bleeding tech talent at an alarming rate. While social media is focused on US tech layoffs, Germany has lost over 12,000 jobs in 2024 alone. The economic engine of Europe is stalling with manufacturing in decline for two consecutive years. So, what's happening? Why is talent fleeing east and south? And most importantly, what does this mean for tech careers today?</p>

<p class="english-text">This video series is for tech professionals already living and working in the US, Canada, the UK, or the European Union. If you're based outside these regions or in an outsourcing heavy market, the data in this video will not apply to your situation. I do not cover immigration, international job hunting, or topics like how to break into tech without a college degree. If that's what you're here for, this probably isn't the right channel, and that's okay. But if you are operating within these markets, keep watching. There's a lot ahead for various seniority levels and career tracks in tech. This is episode 6 of my video series, Where to Run, where I explore the smartest places for mid to senior tech workers to rebuild post layoffs and postpandemic. And on today's episode, we've got Deutseland.</p>

### 德国科技行业的现状与文化

在过去三年中，德国的科技行业一直是欧洲受疫情后动荡和裁员潮影响最严重的两个国家之一。在新冠疫情之前，德国已成为欧洲主要的科技中心，是英国以外最大的科技中心，拥有大量的初创企业和在传统公司内部设有重要科技实验室的企业。然而，自疫情开始以来，随着随后的大规模裁员、投资重点和投资量的变化，德国的工作文化也发生了重塑，极大地改变了科技生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Germany's tech industry has been among top two most affected in Europe by post-pandemic turbulence and a way of layoffs over the past 3 years. Prior to COVID, Germany had emerged as a major tech hub in Europe, the largest one outside of the UK with an abundance of startups and traditional firms with significant tech labs inside those firms. Nevertheless, since the beginning of the pandemic, with the effects of subsequent mass layoffs, investment priorities and investment volume in Germany has shifted and changes in the work culture reshaped the tech ecosystem very significantly.</p>
</details>

仅在2024年，就有超过12,000个科技工作岗位被裁减，这与美国的15万个数字相去甚远，但对欧洲来说仍然非常显著。为应对利润下降和充满挑战的疫情后经济环境，德国主要雇主各自裁减了数千名员工。2025年4月，德国制造业**PMI**（Purchasing Managers' Index: 采购经理人指数，衡量制造业经济活动的指标）为48.4，仍低于预示扩张的50点大关。该国已连续两年经济负增长，国内生产总值（GDP）持续萎缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">More than 12,000 tech jobs were cut in 2024 alone, which is definitely far from the US figure, which is 150k, but still very significant for Europe. Major German employers have each laid off thousands of workers in response to falling profits and a challenging post-pandemic economic landscape. The German manufacturing PMI was 48.4 in April 2025, which is still below the 50 mark that signals expansion. The country had two consecutive years of negative economic growth with GDP contracting.</p>
</details>

现在，即使我们谈论的是科技，为什么所有这些制造业数据在德国的背景下仍然很重要？这很重要，因为制造业在德国GDP中的份额远大于任何其他欧洲国家。如果德国的制造业出现问题，就会对其他所有行业产生连锁反应。德国的工业和汽车巨头构成了欧洲最大经济体的支柱，它们都在努力应对能源价格上涨和外部需求下降造成的宏观经济逆风。德国是一个高度依赖出口的经济体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why is all of this manufacturing data important in the context of Germany even though we talk about tech? This is important because the manufacturing share of Germany's GDP is much larger than that of any other European country. And if Germany has issues with manufacturing, it has a ripple effect on everything else. German industrial and automotive giants make up the backbone of Europe's biggest economy and all of them struggle to cope with macroeconomic headwinds caused by the rising energy prices and falling external demand. Germany is a highly export dependent economy.</p>
</details>

### 科技公司裁员与人才外流

回到科技话题。以下是一些知名欧洲科技雇主的数据点。**Klarna**，一家著名的瑞典**独角兽**（unicorn: 估值超过10亿美元的未上市初创公司），在柏林设有主要办事处，在2022年至2025年间将其全球员工数量削减了40%。该公司没有披露德国的具体数字，但柏林的科技职位受影响尤其严重，因为Klarna将更多科技业务转移到成本较低的国家。在**Reddit**和**Blind**上有多条帖子，内部人员报告了大致的计算结果，但我未能找到可靠的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now back to tech. A few data points on some well-known European tech employers. Klarna, a notable Swedish unicorn with a major office in Berlin, reduced its global workforce by 40% between 2022 and 2025. The company does not disclose Germany specific numbers, but Berlin tech roles were particularly affected because Klarna shifted more tech operations to lowercost countries. There are multiple threads on Reddit and Blind with internal people reporting approximate calculations, but I haven't been able to find a reliable number.</p>
</details>

**Wayfair**于2025年1月裁减了约730个工作岗位，因为它完全退出了德国市场，所有本地职位都被裁撤或调离。**Revolut**在2024年暂停了柏林的招聘，并向现有员工提供了搬迁到西班牙、葡萄牙或波兰的选择。该公司柏林科技团队的规模并未公开披露，但内部员工报告称人数急剧减少。因此，招聘冻结和搬迁提议表明Revolut在德国的科技业务大幅缩减。美国科技巨头在2024年和2025年也显著减少或暂停了在柏林的招聘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wayfair eliminated approximately 730 jobs in January 2025 as it exited the German market completely and all local roles were either cut or relocated. Revolute implemented a hiring freeze in Berlin in 2024 and offered existing staff to relocate to Spain, Portugal or Poland. The company's Berlin tech team size is not publicly disclosed, but internal employees report a dramatic reduction. So the hiring freeze and the relocation offers indicate a substantial downsizing of the Revolute's German tech operation. US tech giants have significantly reduced or paused hiring in Berlin for 2024 and 2025.</p>
</details>

因此，出现了一种模式，科技人员被转移到东欧或南欧，如波兰、匈牙利、西班牙、葡萄牙，以及过去曾是热门选择但由于持续战争现在不太受欢迎的乌克兰。如果是在欧洲之外，最受欢迎的选择是印度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there is a pattern where tech staff is shifted either to Eastern or Southern Europe, Poland, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Ukraine and the past but a lot less favored now due to the ongoing war. If it's outside of Europe, the most popular choice is India.</p>
</details>

在关于瑞典和丹麦的视频下，有一些评论说瑞典科技市场非常糟糕，根本没有工作。我经常回复他们说，这并非丹麦或瑞典独有。加拿大和美国，以及几乎所有其他**G7**（Group of Seven: 七国集团，由世界七大发达经济体组成）国家的情况都完全相同。随着这个系列视频的深入，您会发现这是一种普遍模式，因为是的，科技市场 everywhere 都不景气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, under the Sweden Denmark video, there were a bunch of comments from people saying that the Swedish tech market is absolutely terrible and that there are no jobs. And I often respond to them saying that this is not specific to Denmark or Sweden. It's the exact same thing in Canada and the US and pretty much any other G7 country. And the bigger the series gets, the more you'll see that this is a pattern because yes, the tech market is bad everywhere.</p>
</details>

我几年来在加拿大也看到了完全相同的趋势，整个开发和**QA**（Quality Assurance: 质量保证）部门都被外包。通常最先被外包的是开发人员和QA人员，然后是设计师，有时甚至是项目经理（PM）。项目经理很少被外包，仅仅是因为这份工作的性质要求您对市场有非常好的把握，并且您必须了解您所运营市场的条件、使用模式和行为。当您居住在您工作或产品所在市场之外时，很难保持工作所需的这种意识水平。但即使是项目经理也正在被外包。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been seeing the exact same trend in Canada for several years now where entire departments of devs and QAs are being outsourced. It's always the devs and QAs first that get outsourced then designers and sometimes even PMs. PMs are rarely outsourced simply because the nature of the job requires you to have a very good grip of the market and you have to understand the conditions, the usage patterns, the behavior of the market that you operate in. And when you live outside of the market that you work in or that your product is in, it's really hard to maintain that level of awareness required for the job. But even PMS are being outsourced.</p>
</details>

### 德国科技行业面临的挑战

在为本视频进行研究时，我花了很多时间调查为什么德国受影响如此之大。因此，这是我在阅读了数十份报告、LinkedIn帖子、研究报告以及受影响者和留守者在Reddit和Blind上发布的帖子后，能够描绘出的图景。如果我遗漏了什么，请在评论中指出。我希望这个系列尽可能详细和客观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As I was doing research for this video, I spent quite a bit of time looking into why Germany got affected so much. So here is the picture that I'm able to paint after reading tens of reports and LinkedIn posts and research studies and Reddit and blind threads posted by those people who got affected and those who stayed. So, if there's anything I'm missing, please post in the comments. I do want this series to be as detailed and as objective as possible.</p>
</details>

**原因一：高成本结构和劳工法。** 德国历来拥有非常严格的劳工保护法和相对较高的工资预期。这使得公司维持庞大的本地科技团队成本非常高昂，特别是与成本较低的欧洲目的地相比。疫情后远程工作常态化，公司意识到他们可以在波兰、匈牙利、西班牙和葡萄牙等国家招聘到同样或类似质量的人才。再加上大量东欧人因战争而迁移到西欧各地，公司现在能够以显著降低的成本招聘到高质量人才，从而促使职位转移到德国之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, reason number one, high cost structure and labor laws. Germany historically has had very strict labor protection laws and relatively high wage expectations. And that makes it very expensive for companies to maintain large local tech teams, especially compared to lowerc cost European destinations. As remote work became normalized post pandemic, companies realized that they can hire the exact same quality of talent or similar quality of talent in countries like Poland, Hungary, Spain, and Portugal. And this combined with a large number of Eastern Europeans migrating around Western Europe as a result of the war, companies are now able to hire very high quality talent at a significantly lower cost, prompting a shift of roles outside of Germany.</p>
</details>

**原因二：薪资预期和生活成本。** 德国不断上涨的生活成本，尤其是在慕尼黑等高成本城市，常常促使科技专业人士寻求非常高且有竞争力的薪酬。但许多科技公司，尤其是初创企业，根本无法承担。由于预算限制，尤其是在不稳定的经济环境下，它们无法满足这些期望。此外，还有关税战，天知道何时会结束。因此，大多数公司根本无法负担在德国设立团队的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reason number two, salary expectations and the cost of living. The rising cost of living in Germany, especially in high-cost cities like Munich, often drives tech professionals to seek very high and competitive compensation. But many tech companies, especially startups, simply cannot afford it. They cannot meet those expectations due to budget constraints, especially in a volatile economic climate. on top of this at the tariff war when God knows how that's going to end. So most companies simply cannot afford having their teams in Germany.</p>
</details>

**原因三：监管和政策不确定性。** 许多科技公司认为德国日益不可预测的监管和税收环境是一种阻碍。快速引入的法规，例如供应链法案，以及德国闻名的复杂官僚体系，使得与更灵活的欧洲市场相比，德国对科技投资和扩张的吸引力降低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reason number three, regulatory and policy uncertainty. Many tech companies site Germany's increasingly unpredictable regulatory and tax environment as a deterrent. Rapidly introduced regulations such as the supply chain act and complex bureaucracy that Germany is known for make it less attractive for tech investment and expansion compared to more agile European markets.</p>
</details>

**原因四：技能需求转变。** 德国科技公司所需的技能类型已经发生演变。**机器学习**、**数据科学**、**物联网**（IoT: Internet of Things）、**区块链**（blockchain）等新兴技术需求旺盛。专业知识与高需求领域不符的求职者发现更难获得工作机会，仅仅是因为许多传统编程职位正在被积极外包。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reason number four, shift in skill demand. The types of skills that German tech companies are looking for have evolved. Emerging tech such as machine learning, data science, IoT, blockchain are in demand. Job seekers whose expertise does not align with high demand areas find it harder to land offers simply because a lot of traditional programming roles are being actively outsourced.</p>
</details>

### 德国与瑞典科技裁员影响对比

现在，快速回顾我之前的瑞典和丹麦视频，因为评论中有一群人说瑞典科技市场多么糟糕，根本没有工作。为了公平起见，这里是瑞典和德国裁员影响的比较，仅是裁员影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a quick reference to my previous Sweden and Denmark video because there were a bunch of people in the comments saying how incredibly terrible the Swedish tech market is and that there are no jobs. In the interest of being fair, here is the comparison of the layoff impact, just the layoff impact between Sweden and Germany. Starting with Germany.</p>
</details>

从德国开始。自2022年以来，德国与英国一道成为欧洲科技裁员最严重的国家之一。失去了12,000到19,000个工作岗位。这是欧洲仅次于美国的最高数字。裁员在初创企业和大型科技公司中持续不断，许多公司还将职位外包到成本较低的国家。预计这一趋势将继续，三分之一的德国公司计划在2025年进一步裁员。德国科技劳动力面临日益增加的就业不安全感，该行业的复苏受到经济停滞、监管障碍以及工作岗位外流的阻碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Germany alongside the UK has become one of Europe's hardest hit countries for tech layoffs since 2022. Between 12 and 19,000 jobs were lost. This is the highest number in Europe after the US. Layoffs have been persistent across startups and large tech firms with many companies also offshoring roles to lowercost countries. This trend is expected to continue with one in three German companies planning further job cuts in 2025. The German tech workforce faces increased job insecurity and the sector's recovery has been hampered by economic stagnation as well as regulatory hurdles and a shift of jobs abroad.</p>
</details>

现在，让我们看看瑞典。瑞典在疫情初期经历了非常急剧的裁员高峰。所有行业（包括科技）约有27,000个工作岗位被裁减。我未能找到专门针对科技职位的确切和可靠数字，但与德国相比，科技行业的裁员规模较小，持续时间也较短。瑞典拥有发达国家中最高的再就业率。超过80%的被裁员工在一年内找到了新工作，这是发达国家中最好的比率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, let's look at Sweden. Sweden's experienced a very sharp spike in layoffs at the very start of the pandemic. It was approximately 27,000 jobs cut across all sectors, including tech. I wasn't able to find the exact number and reliable number specifically for tech jobs, but the tech sector's layoffs were smaller in scale and shorter in duration compared to Germany. Sweden holds the title for the highest reemployment rate in the developed world. More than 80% of laid-off workers find new jobs within a year, which is the best rate in the developed countries.</p>
</details>

到2024年和2025年，瑞典的科技行业比欧洲其他地区恢复得更好，对专业人才的需求旺盛，并拥有出色的初创企业和创新生态系统。该行业表现出显著的韧性，裁员主要限于**Spotify**和**Northvolt**等知名案例，2025年没有出现持续的科技失业潮。因此，公平地说，尽管科技市场几乎 everywhere 都不景气，但瑞典并非一场灾难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By 2024 and 2025, Sweden's tech industry recovered much better than that of the rest of Europe with high demand for specialized talent and a wonderful startup and innovation ecosystems. The sector has shown remarkable resilience with layoffs mostly limited to high-profile cases like Spotify and Northworld and no sustained wave of tech job losses in 2025. So to be fair, while the tech market is bad pretty much everywhere, Sweden's not exactly a disaster.</p>
</details>

### 德国科技人才与创新中心

德国科技人才受过高等教育。德国的教育质量非常高，而且非常实惠，因为公立大学收取很少或不收取学费，使得国内和国际学生都能接受教育。此时，所有收听的北美听众可能都流下了眼泪，因为我们大多数人毕业时都背负着数万美元的债务，有时甚至是数十万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Quality of talent. German tech talent is highly educated. Education in Germany is of very high quality, and it's very affordable because public universities charge little to no tuition fees, making education accessible to both domestic and international students. And at this point, all North Americans listening to this got a little tear rolling down their face because most of us graduate with tens of thousands of dollars in debt. sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
</details>

德国有很多值得骄傲的地方，我将按城市进行细分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Germany has lots to be proud of, and I'll do a breakdown by the city.</p>
</details>

**柏林。** 柏林是德国顶级的初创企业中心，是**Zalando**、**N26**、**Delivery Hero**等独角兽公司以及几家非常有前途的自动驾驶初创企业的所在地。N26除了是一家非常稳健的**数字银行**（Neo bank: 一种完全基于互联网运营的新型银行），拥有超过400万用户，巅峰时期估值达90亿美元，还被广泛认为是企业家的孵化器，至少有34家初创公司由N26校友创立。对于那些没听说过Delivery Hero的人来说，它是全球最成功的食品配送公司之一，其全球影响力可与Uber Eats媲美。**DeepL**是另一个值得提及的公司，但它位于科隆，而不是柏林。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Berlin. Berlin is Germany's top startup hub, home to unicorns like Zelando, N26, Delivery Hero, and several very promising autonomous driving startups. N26 apart from being a very solid NEO bank with more than four million users and a nine billion dollar valuation at its peak is widely recognized as the breeding ground for entrepreneurs with at least 34 startups founded by N26 alumni. Delivery Hero for those of you who haven't heard about it is one of the world's most successful food delivery companies with a global reach comparable to Uber Eats. Deep L is another notable mention except it's based in Cologne, not in Berlin.</p>
</details>

现在，请不要来找我说：“嗯，这些公司确实存在，但有多少人在那里工作？”这不是关于谁在那里工作或不工作的问题。事实是，这个国家要么培养出顶尖人才，要么给予他们自由，并不是每个国家都能夸耀这一点。柏林和慕尼黑的科技场景正在演变为创新中心，专注于**人工智能**（AI）、物联网、自动驾驶、区块链和软件工程，这些领域都在德国历来闻名的汽车、制造和金融行业内。然而，科技和初创企业年度薪资调查连续第三年显示出令人担忧的趋势：德国的平均薪资停滞不前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, please don't come at me and be like, "Yeah, well, those firms exist, but how many people work there?" It's not about who works there and who doesn't. It's a fact that the country either produces or gives the freedom to top-notch talent, and not every country can brag about it. Berlin's and Munich's tech scene is evolving into innovation hubs focusing on AI, internet of things, autonomous driving, blockchain, and software engineering within the industries that Germany has historically been known for, automotive, manufacturing, and financial. Nevertheless, for the third year in a row, the annual salary survey for the tech and startup sectors reveals a concerning trend. Median salaries have stagnated in Germany.</p>
</details>

**慕尼黑。** 慕尼黑将强大的工业基础与蓬勃发展的初创企业场景相结合，以物联网、先进制造、机器人技术和传统软件开发而闻名。慕尼黑的知名企业包括**Celonis**、**Personio**、**FlixBus**、**Lilium**等。慕尼黑拥有密集的**STEM**（Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics: 科学、技术、工程、数学）学生群体，其中43%是本地毕业生，这是德国城市中最高的数字。慕尼黑经常被评为全球生活质量最佳城市之一，这使其对人才的保留和招聘具有吸引力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Moving on to Munich. Munich combines a very strong industrial base with a thriving startup scene and is known for IoT, advanced manufacturing, robotics, and traditional software development.

Munich boasts a dense concentration of STEM students. 43% of them are local graduates and that is the highest number among the German cities. Munich regularly ranks as one of the world's best cities for quality of life, making it attractive for talent retention and recruitment.</p>
</details>

**汉堡。** 汉堡正获得顶级科技城市的认可，在2024年人才城市指数中排名第二，仅次于柏林，但领先于慕尼黑。它以**Xing**、几家游戏公司和**Statista**而闻名。该市在自然科学相关技术、物流和**金融科技**（fintech: 金融科技，利用技术改进和自动化金融服务）方面处于领先地位。汉堡提供良好的生活质量和文化多样性，对国内和国际科技专业人士都具有吸引力。

<details>

Hamburg offers a good quality of life and cultural diversity, making it attractive to both domestic and international tech professionals.</p>
</details>

**法兰克福。** 法兰克福是德国的金融和数据基础设施中心，处理着欧洲约25%的互联网流量，拥有**SAP**、**Software AG**、**Equinix**、**MongoDB**（总部设在美国，但在法兰克福设有主要办事处和人才基地）和**Bolt**等公司。该市以金融科技安全、云计算而闻名，并且拥有非常强大的初创企业生态系统。法兰克福将高收入潜力与出色的城市体验相结合，它也是一个非常便利的旅行枢纽，因为您可以从法兰克福飞往几乎任何地方。

### 德国科技行业的新兴趋势

现在，谈谈德国因科技裁员和外包而正在经历的一些不那么明显的趋势，我敢说，这些趋势在未来几年将更加强劲地显现。德国正在经历一场超越传统创业的自由职业热潮。选择自由职业和独立承包的科技工作者显著增加。德国现在有超过400万自由职业者，其中IT、媒体和咨询行业高度集中。这一转变得益于灵活性、远程工作的兴起以及连接自由职业者与客户的平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now onto some not so obvious trends Germany is experiencing as a result of tech layoffs and offshoring and that dare I say I predict will emerge even more strongly in the coming years. Germany is experiencing freelance boom beyond traditional entrepreneurship. There is a marked increase in tech workers opting for freelancing and independent contracting. Germany now has over 4 million freelancers with a significant concentration in IT media and consulting. This shift is fueled by the flexibility and the rise of remote work and the platforms that connect freelancers with clients.</p>
</details>

**更高的费率和自主权。** 许多自由职业者要求的费率高于受薪员工。但即便如此，对于公司而言，承包商员工通常比受薪员工更便宜，而且承包商享有更大的自主权和项目选择权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Higher rates and autonomy. Many freelancers command higher rates than salaried employees. But even then, the contractor employee is often cheaper for the company than a salaried employee, and contractors enjoy greater autonomy and project selection.</p>
</details>

由于科技裁员、欧洲整体经济停滞以及自由职业的兴起，另一个趋势正在出现：创业的兴起，尤其是在年轻人中。我们已经看到了早期迹象，在我看来，这只会加速。这种激增与裁员的后果、人们寻求非传统就业以及向远程工作的转变密切相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a result of the tech layoffs, the overall economic stagnation in Europe, and the rise of freelancing, another trend is emerging, a rise in entrepreneurship, especially among the youth. We're already seeing early signs, and in my view, it's only going to accelerate. This surge is closely tied to the aftermath of layoffs, people seeking non-traditional employment, and the shift towards remote work.</p>
</details>

**从传统中心转移。** 随着公司在柏林和其他主要科技城市搬迁或缩减规模，科技人才正在分散到德国的小城镇和国外。一些公司现在要求员工搬迁到德国境内非传统的科技中心，如曼海姆或内尔堡，或者鼓励员工搬迁到波兰、西班牙或葡萄牙等其他国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shift away from traditional hubs. As companies relocate or downsize in Berlin and other major tech cities, tech talent is dispersing to smaller towns in Germany and abroad. Some companies now require relocation to less traditional tech centers within Germany such as Mannheim or Nerburgg or encourage employees to move to other countries such as Poland, Spain or Portugal.</p>
</details>

**行业蔓延。** 随着科技职位转移到海外，德国剩余的办事处越来越专注于业务销售和德语职能，而技术和产品职位则在其他地方整合。

### 德国科技行业的“氛围”

德国是我去欧洲旅行时去得最多的国家，因为我与它有个人联系。就像其他任何地方一样，我喜欢它的一些方面，也有一些方面我不太喜欢。所以，请对我的观点持保留态度。我将尽力专注于科技场景的氛围。但是，请记住，这混合了科技印象和对这个国家的个人感受。

There are things I am not so jived about, just like with any other place. So, please take this with a grain of salt. I will do my best to focus on the vibe of the tech scene. But, please keep in mind that this is a mix of tech impressions and personal perception of the country.</p>

在我看来，德国的科技场景非常类似于它生产的汽车。德国的科技就像一辆宝马。它不疯狂华丽，但非常坚固、耐用和可靠。它并非疯狂实验性，不声称正在开发时间机器，也不承诺到2030年实现未来，而是充分拥抱来自美国或中国的创新，并在工业和应用技术领域设定自己的标准，提供他们最擅长的：质量、耐用性和可预测性。

<p class="english-text">So, in my books, the German tech scene is very similar to the cars it's producing. Germany's tech is like a BMV. Learn it. It's not crazy glamorous, but it's very sturdy. It's very durable and very reliable. It is not insanely experimental. It is not claiming to be developing the time machine and it doesn't promise the future by 2030 but instead it fully embraces the innovation coming from the US or China and it sets its own standards in industrial and applied tech and they deliver what they do best quality durability and predictability.</p>

至于缺点，德国在制造业方面正努力与中国竞争。我之前解释过为什么制造业如此重要，即使在科技背景下也是如此。德国越来越难以维持生存和竞争力。我从小就有一种刻板印象，如果你拥有任何德国制造的东西，那它一定是顶级的，会永远耐用。但现在，在做出某些购买决定时，我不得不承认中国替代品常常让我惊叹。客观地说，我能理解为什么德国制造业正经历经济停滞。

<p class="english-text">As for the downsides, Germany is struggling to stay competitive in manufacturing against China. And I explained earlier why manufacturing is so important, even in the context of tech. It's getting harder and harder for Germany to stay afloat and competitive. I grew up with the stereotype that if you own anything Germanmade, this thing is going to be top-notch. This thing will last forever. But at this point, when making certain buying decisions, I do want to admit that Chinese alternatives often blow my mind. And objectively, I can see why Germany is going through economics technation in the manufacturing sector.</p>

然而，截至2025年，我所看到的德国科技氛围是，如果您身处高需求专业领域，它仍然是欧洲一个非常稳固的科技之地。但对于科技行业而言，它已不再是十年前的那个国家了。但同样，这适用于整个G7国家。

<p class="english-text">Nevertheless, as of 2025, the way I see German tech vibe is that it is still a very solid place for tech in Europe if you are in a high demand specialty. But for tech industry, it is not the same country that it was 10 years ago. But again, this applies to the entire G7 cost of living.</p>

### 科技工作者的生活成本与薪资

随着我制作这个系列的视频越来越多，我收到了很多评论，其中不乏非常有力的论据和建设性的反驳。对于所有在评论中提供尊重反馈的人，我真诚地感谢你们。我非常欣赏即使意见不合也能保持尊重和文明的能力。这也有助于我在研究中做得更好。因此，这次我决定使用稍微不同的指标来描绘德国科技工作者在疫情后的经济状况。

<p class="english-text">So, the more videos I'm making in the series, the more comments I get from people with often very solid arguments and constructive push back. And to all of the people who provide respectful feedback in the comments, I truly thank you. I do appreciate the ability to be respectful and civil even when you disagree. And that also helps me get better in my research. So I've decided to use slightly different metrics this time to paint the picture of the Germany's economic situation for tech workers that is postcoid and post pandemic.</p>
</details>

现在，在我谈论数字之前，我必须提一件事。在做这项研究时，我查阅了**欧盟统计局**（Eurostat: 欧盟的统计机构）发布的几份报告，它们描绘了一幅非常悲观的景象，而德国联邦统计局则表示欧盟统计局夸大了事实，尤其是在贫困水平方面，数字差异很大。我绝不是经济学家，我也无意解释德国的整体经济状况。因此，我将重点关注我根据高级科技工作者（如数据科学家或产品经理）的单人开支所汇总的摘要。

<p class="english-text">Now I got to mention one thing before I talk about the numbers. As I was doing the research for this I went through multiple reports published by Euroat painting a very sad picture and the federal statistics office saying that the Euroat is exaggerating and the numbers are especially different when it comes to poverty levels. Now, I'm not an economist by any means, and I'm not taking on a mission to interpret Germany's full economic situation. So, I'm going to focus on the summary that I compiled based on single person expenses for a senior level tech worker such as a data scientist or a product manager.</p>

那么，为什么选择这两个职位呢？因为它们代表了我频道上最大的两个受众群体，而且它们也涵盖了软件工程师的薪资，因为这些薪资数据点与它们非常接近。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, why these two roles? Because they represent two of the biggest audience groups on my channel, and they also capture software engineering salaries because they're very close to these data points as well.</p>

**科技中心的居住成本：柏林。** 一名高级数据科学家年薪约为84,000至110,000欧元，中位数薪资略低于100,000欧元。高级产品经理情况类似，年薪在91,000至125,000欧元之间，中位数为102,000欧元。现在您将看到这里的税率，我想澄清一下我在这张表格中列出的税率。**实际税率**（effective tax rate: 实际缴纳的税款占总收入的比例）和总税款之间存在差异。实际税率用于国际比较，主要关注所得税。它不包括**社会保障缴款**（social security contributions: 雇主和雇员为社会保障计划（如养老金、医疗保险）缴纳的款项）。因此，如果包含社会保障，总税款会更高。我没有包含社会保障数字，因为它们可能因就业类型、收入水平和个人情况而异。

<p class="english-text">Cost of living in TechHubs, Berlin. A senior data scientist pulls in around 84 to €110,000 euros with median salary being just short of €100,000. Senior PM's similar situation between 91 and 125 with median at 102. Now you're going to see the tax rate here and I want to clarify a few things about the tax rate that I put at this table. There is a difference between the effective tax rate and the total tax. The effective tax is what is used in international comparisons focusing on income tax. It does not include social security contributions. So the total tax would be higher if social security is included. I did not include social security numbers because they can vary greatly depending on the employment type, income level, and personal circumstances.</p>

慕尼黑的薪资大致相同，但生活成本要高得多。慕尼黑被认为是德国最昂贵的城市之一。汉堡的薪资较低，生活成本也较低。此外，根据我找到的数据，产品经理在汉堡的收入似乎较低，原因不明。所以，汉堡或德国的各位，我很想听听你们的看法，特别是如果你们知道为什么会这样。最后，法兰克福的薪资与汉堡非常相似，但生活成本略高。

<p class="english-text">Munich salaries are about the same, but the cost of living is much higher. Munich is known to be one of the most expensive places in Germany. Hamburg, lower salaries and lower cost of living. Also, based on the data I was able to find, PMs tend to make less in Hamburg for some reason. So, folks in Hamburg or in Germany in general would love to hear your take, especially if you know why that is. And lastly, Frankfurt salaries very similar to Hamburg, but cost of living slightly higher.</p>

### 结论：德国是否是科技职业的理想选择？

那么，什么时候德国是个好主意呢？如果您已经居住在德国并希望留在欧盟，德国是一个不错的选择。它仍然拥有欧洲大陆最强大的科技基础设施之一，并且如果您从事新兴技术、金融科技或物联网领域，它非常棒。如果您是高需求领域的专家，例如机器人技术、计算机视觉、云计算、机器学习、网络安全，并且不介意稳定而非炒作，那么德国很适合您。如果您希望获得世界一流的大学和为您及家人提供低成本教育的机会，德国是理想之地。如果您喜欢在一个科技界普遍使用英语但文化仍然优先考虑本地融合的国家工作，那么德国也很棒。

<p class="english-text">Conclusion, when is Germany a good idea? Germany is great if you live in Germany already and you want to stay within the European Union. It still has one of the strongest tech infrastructures on the continent and it is great if you are in emerging tech, fintech or IoT. You're a specialist in a high demand, robotics, computer vision, cloud, machine learning, cyber security and you don't mind stability over hype. It is great if you want access to worldclass universities and lowcost education for you and your family. And it is great if you prefer working in a country where English is commonly spoken in the tech scene. But the culture still prioritizes local integration.</p>
</details>

什么时候德国不是一个好主意呢？如果您希望薪资快速增长，那么德国的平均工资正在停滞，总税收加上社会保障缴款会大幅削减您的实际可支配收入。如果您正在寻找像美式那样的高增长初创企业活力，因为大部分这种活力正在转移到西班牙、葡萄牙和东欧等更便宜、更灵活的市场。如果您从事的职位（如**前端开发**（front-end development）或QA）正日益被外包，成本压力和远程工作正在加速这一趋势。最后，如果您来自美国或加拿大，期望生活质量大幅提升，请记住，在灵活性、官僚主义和税后成本方面的权衡将使其与您来自的国家大致相似。

<p class="english-text">When is Germany not a good idea? If you're hoping for rapid salary growth, median pay in Germany is stagnating and the total tax plus the social security contributions cut deep into your take-home budget. If you're looking for high growth startup energy like American style energy because much of that is relocating to cheaper, more agile markets like Spain, Portugal, and Eastern Europe. And if you're in a role that is increasingly outsourced, front-end development or QA, cost pressures and remote work are accelerating this trend. And lastly, if you're coming from the US or Canada, expecting a drastic quality of life upgrade. Keep in mind that the trade-offs in flexibility, bureaucracy, and cost after tax will make it pretty much similar to the countries that you're coming from.</p>
