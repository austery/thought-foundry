### 气候适应：加拿大韧性建设的核心

构建**气候韧性**（Climate Resilience: 应对气候变化影响并从中恢复的能力）意味着什么？Anabela Bonada是滑铁卢大学**英泰气候适应中心**（Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation: 致力于气候适应研究与实践的机构）的气候科学常务董事。她认为，加拿大不应仅仅对灾害作出反应，更应该为此做好准备。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What does building climate resilience look like? Anabela Bonada is managing director of climate science at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation, based at the University of Waterloo. She says Canada shouldn't just respond to disasters, it should also prepare for them to.</p>
</details>

她解释说，这是一个非常好的问题。**气候适应**（Climate Adaptation: 调整自然或人类系统以应对实际或预期的气候变化及其影响的过程）与**气候减缓**（Climate Mitigation: 减少温室气体排放以减缓全球变暖的过程）截然不同。在过去的30年里，我们通过媒体听到了很多关于减缓措施的讨论，这对于加拿大乃至全世界的人们来说更为普遍。而当我们谈论气候适应和气候变化时，我们关注的是如何准备我们的家园、社区，并改变我们的行为，以适应不断变化的气候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Excellent question. So it's very different from mitigation. We hear a lot about mitigation in the media for maybe the last 30 years. It's been more mainstream for us as Canadians and in the world. When we talk about adaptation and climate change, we're looking at preparing our homes, our communities, changing our behaviour to adapt to the climbing, the changing climate.</p>
</details>

随着气候的变化，我们看到更多的野火、洪水和极端高温发生。例如，加拿大现在出现了以前没有的长时间极端高温季节。因此，我们正在寻找方法来真正调整我们的生活，以便我们能够在这种不断变化的条件下生存。这正是气候适应的真正含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with changing climate, we're seeing more wildfire, more flooding occur, extreme heat. So we have these like long seasons of extreme heat in Canada now that we didn't have before. So we are looking for ways to really adapt our lives so that we can live in these changing conditions. And that's really what adaptation is.</p>
</details>

### 气候适应在加拿大的演变

气候适应何时进入加拿大人的词汇？我们是什么时候开始思考这个问题的？Anabela Bonada表示，这个问题很好，因为我们多年来一直了解适应。它与减缓措施一同发展，但当时没有人太关注它，因为感觉谈论适应就好像我们放弃了气候变化一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did climate adaptation enter the Canadian lexicon? When did we start thinking about this? That's really good because really we've known about adaptation for many years. So again, it's kind of grew up with mitigation, but nobody paid much attention to it because it felt like we were giving up on climate if we talked about adaptation.</p>
</details>

然而，在过去的十年里，加拿大发生了真正的转变。气候影响只增不减。我们已经在经济上看到了损失，也看到了生命损失。因此，适应性措施真正进入了讨论。可以说，在过去的五年里，它才真正成为主流，但在过去十年里，它一直是讨论的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But over the last ten years, there's been a real shift in Canada. So the impacts from climate have only gone up. We've seen it in financially, we've seen it in loss of lives. So adaptation has really entered the conversation. And I would say it's become mainstream in the last five years really. But part of the conversation for the last ten.</p>
</details>

如果我们将重点放在适应部分，是否意味着我们放弃了减缓部分？Anabela Bonada强调，绝不如此，我们永远不会要求那样发生。两者需要同时进行。这也是我们从加拿大各地从事这类工作的人们那里听到越来越多的声音。我们需要将两者结合起来，而不是将它们视为独立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on a point you just made. If we are focusing on the adaptation part, are we sort of giving up on the mitigation part? No, never. And we would never ask for that to happen. Both need to happen together. And that's what we're hearing more from people across Canada that do this kind of work. We need to combine the two and not see them as separate.</p>
</details>

如果我们只进行减缓而不为影响做好社区准备，我们将继续感受这些影响并遭受我们不希望发生的损失。即使我们今天完全减少排放，由于气候恢复正常所需的时间，气候变化的影响仍将持续存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we only mitigate and we don't prepare our communities for the impacts, we're going to continue to feel them and have losses that we just don't want to have. The impacts will continue to be felt from climate change, even if we were to completely reduce our emissions today, just from how long it will take for for the climate to go back to normal.</p>
</details>

### 加拿大的国家适应战略

适应性措施何时在加拿大成为一项官方战略？Anabela Bonada指出，是在2023年。联邦政府于2023年发布了**国家适应战略**（National Adaptation Strategy: 加拿大联邦政府应对气候变化影响的官方策略），其中包含26个目标，旨在帮助加拿大人了解极端天气，并学习如何在社区和家庭层面降低风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did adaptation become an official strategy here in Canada? 2023. So I do have a. Fairly recent. Super recent. Yeah, we're still kind of learning our way through it. The federal government released their National Adaptation Strategy in 2023, with 26 targets for Canadians to learn about extreme weather and to learn what to do as communities and at the household level to reduce their risk. So we're still implementing those strategies across the country. There's a lot of work being done on it, but it's super new for us.</p>
</details>

### 野火适应：从家庭到社区的行动

Anabela Bonada作为野火专家，建议从家庭层面开始采取适应措施。人们可以做很多事情。例如，在野火季结束、冬季来临之前，清理院子，清除任何干燥的碎屑。确保甲板下或房屋周围没有杂物。房屋周围1.5米的防火带非常重要，应尽可能保持清洁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to get into some real world examples. You are an expert in wildfires, so I think let's start with that. If we were to look at adaptation, what does it look like in the terms of wildfires? There are different levels of adaptation for wildfires. So we can start at the home level. Let's do it. Yeah. There's so much that people can do. And I kind of love that about wildfire, about adaptation. Everyone can do it. So if you have some time this weekend, we're almost in the off season wildfire seasons ending. End of October. Yeah, exactly. This is a perfect time right before winter to go and look at your yard, clean up your yard. If there's any dry debris, remove it. Make sure there's nothing under your deck or around your home. The 1.5 perimeter around the home is really important to keep as clear as possible.</p>
</details>

如果使用覆盖物，可以考虑将其改为土壤或岩石，这将大大防止房屋被烧毁或处于危险之中。大多数房屋都是被余烬烧毁的，因此即使野火没有发生在社区附近，余烬也可能落在这些地方并引燃房屋。所以，请考虑清除一些植被，并减少离房屋较远处的堆积物。即使有一些高大美丽的树木，也要尽量保持它们的健康。将树枝修剪到两米高，这样火就无处可去。通过修剪这些区域，火势就无法蔓延。房主有很多事情可以做，她鼓励大家尽可能地去了解并实施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you have mulching, consider changing that to soil to changing it to rocks, and like that will really prevent your home from burning or being in danger. Most homes burn from embers, so even if a wildfire is not occurring close to your community, the embers can land in those spaces and ignite the home. So just think about that, clearing some of the vegetation and reducing some of the build-up farther away from the home. So even if you have some big beautiful trees, just try to maintain them as healthy as possible. Remove branches up to two metres and that way the fire has nowhere to go. You're just cutting those areas so the fire can't travel. So lots for homeowners to do. And I really encourage them to to look into that and do as much as possible.</p>
</details>

从房主层面扩展到更大的范围，当涉及到森林火灾时，企业或市政当局还能做些什么？Anabela Bonada表示，有很多事情需要做，每个人都需要参与进来以降低风险。企业和市政当局需要考虑那些更大的项目。例如，我们的基础设施在哪里？它是否靠近森林区域？如果是，那么我们需要在这些区域周围建立防火带。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So let's go from homeowners. Let's go bigger. What else can we do when it comes to forest fires. Whether it's businesses or municipalities. Yeah. And there's so much that needs to be done. And everybody needs to participate to reduce risk. So businesses, municipalities they need to think about those bigger projects. So where is our infrastructure. Is it close to forested areas. Then we need to create firebreaks around those areas.</p>
</details>

我们还需要确保有足够的消防用水。例如，2023年发生的一些火灾，就没有足够的消防用水来扑灭。因此，确保消防用水始终充足，这被认为是适应和准备工作。确保人们了解自己的风险并提供教育资源，这也被认为是准备工作。这些对市政当局或企业来说是免费的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also need to make sure we have enough firefighting water for example. So some of the fires that occurred in 2023, there just wasn't enough fire, sorry, enough water to fight those fires off. So making sure that's always up to par, that's considered adaptation and preparedness. Making sure that people are aware of their risk and providing educational resources. That's considered preparedness as well. That doesn't cost municipalities or businesses anything to do.</p>
</details>

然后，一些更大的事情是我们如何设计社区。如果我们正在考虑在加拿大扩展社区和住房（这现在是一个热门话题），我们将在哪里建造这些房屋？如果它们靠近野火发生的**野火城市界面**（Wildland Urban Interface: 野生土地与人类居住区交界处，易发生野火），那么我们应该清除一些植被。在建造房屋之前，确保它们具有野火韧性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then some of the bigger things are how we design our communities. So if we're thinking of expanding communities and housing in Canada, which is a big conversation right now, where are we going to build those homes? And if they're close to that wildland urban interface where wildfires happen, let's clear some of the vegetation. Let's make sure that the homes are wildfire resilient before we build them.</p>
</details>

### 兼顾自然与防火：花园的智慧

当谈到房主和企业时，我们在新冠疫情期间了解到，很多人将自然森林用作“第三空间”。主持人自己也喜欢种植，有一个美丽的花园。对于许多听众来说，听到“不要在房子附近放覆盖物”之类的建议可能会感到困难。如何说服人们，这可能不是最容易做到的，因为他们可能也会觉得很难接受？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do have a question. When you talk about the homeowners and businesses, what we learned during Covid is that we a lot of people used Nature Forests as sort of a third space. I myself love planting. I've got a beautiful garden that I like to tend to. It might be hard for a lot of people who are listening to be like, oh, you know, no mulch, none of that stuff near my house. How do you try to convince people that perhaps it's not the easiest because they might have a hard time with that as well?</p>
</details>

Anabela Bonada认为这是一个很好的观点。很多人听到这些建议后会说：“哦，那我必须移除我的植被或砍掉我的树吗？”她表示他们绝不会这样说，因为那对房屋和环境都不好。我们有传粉植物花园，除了野火风险之外，我们还有很多关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's such a good point. A lot of people hear what we say and they say, oh, so I have to remove my vegetation or cut down my trees. We would never say that because that wouldn't even be good for your home, for the environment. We have pollinator gardens. There's so much that we care about outside of just the wildfire risk.</p>
</details>

首先，你是否面临野火风险？如果你面临风险（根据过去五年加拿大发生的情况，你应该知道，或者咨询你的市政当局），那么你就应该开始实施一些这些措施。话虽如此，也有非常美丽且防火、抗火的花园。**Fire Smart BC**（不列颠哥伦比亚省的防火安全倡议组织）有一个令人惊叹的防火植物清单。例如，她最近在邮件中得知，玉簪花（Hostas）这种常见的植物，人们都很喜欢，它竟然是防火的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first, are you at risk of wildfire? And if you are, and you should know from what we've seen in the past five years, happen in Canada, or just speak to your municipality, then you should start to implement some of these actions. Now, with that being said, there are incredibly beautiful gardens that are fire resistant, fire resilient. Fire Smart BC has an incredible list of plants that are fire resistant. The other day in an email, I got that hostas. They're pretty common, like. Big flower. Yeah, people love them. They're fire resistant. I didn't know this. Okay. I'm not a big gardener. Okay, so for gardeners, there are tons of beautiful plants that they can plant close to the home and just maintain them.</p>
</details>

对于园艺爱好者来说，有很多美丽的植物可以种植在房屋附近，只需好好维护它们。保持它们湿润。你需要确保它们是湿的。如果你的植物干枯了，你就会为你的家制造一个危险。所以，维护一个好的花园实际上对防火韧性来说是完美的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Keep them moisturised. You want to make sure that they're wet. If your plants dry out, you're creating a hazard for your home. So maintaining a good garden is actually perfect for for fire resilience.</p>
</details>

### 洪灾适应：保护家园与社区

谈到保持植物湿润，我们来谈谈洪水。从房主的角度来看，在适应洪水方面我们能做些什么？Anabela Bonada表示，房主和居民可以做很多事情。环顾你的家。如果你有地下室，想想你的贵重物品。这是你可以做的第一个简单的事情。把它们放高一点。即使你必须把它们放在地下室，也要考虑一些置物架或使用一些防水的容器来存放你的贵重物品。这样，万一地下室被淹，你也能保护它们。你需要把物品抬高约30厘米。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talked about water keeping your plants wet. I want to talk about flooding. Now from a homeowner's perspective, what can we do when it when we talk about adapting to flooding? Yeah, there's again tons that homeowners can do that residents can do. So look around your home. What what do you have if you have a basement? Think about your valuables, for example. That's the first easy thing that you can do. Put them higher up. So even if you have to have them in the basement, think of some shelving units or having containers that are a bit water resistant for your valuables. So in case that your basement floods, you can protect it. So you're looking at like about 30 centimetres to keep things raised.</p>
</details>

你可以安装一个**集水坑泵**（Sump Pump: 用于将地下室或低洼区域积水抽走的设备），虽然不是每个家庭都能安装，但如果可以，它在排水方面非常有效。然而，在房屋外部也有很多可以做的事情。例如，在社区里走一走，你会发现随着秋天树叶的落下，我们的排水沟会被覆盖，清理可能需要时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can have a sump pump which not every home can have, but if you can, that's excellent for taking the water out. But outside their home there's a lot that can be done. So like take a walk around your neighbourhood and you'll see that with the leaves that are falling now in the fall, our drains get covered and some of the cleaning might take time to do so.</p>
</details>

仅仅清理这些排水沟就能帮助水在下雨时顺利排出。检查你的**檐槽**（Eavestroughs: 屋顶边缘的排水槽），确保它们也畅通无阻。你不想让树叶堵塞其中，这样水才能流过。最后一个非常简单的方法是延长**落水管**（Downspouts: 连接檐槽将雨水引向地面的管道）。Anabela Bonada喜欢在社区里散步，看看人们都在做什么。有些落水管直接通向地基，所以只需考虑将其延长几米到街道排水沟。这样做已经能大大保护你的家了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just clearing those drains will help the water just drain when it comes down. Looking at your eavestroughs making sure that they're clear as well. You don't want to have leaves in them so that water can flow through. And the last one that's pretty easy is extending downspouts. So I love to take walks around the neighbourhood and kind of look at what people have going on. Some downspouts are going right into the foundation, so just think about extending it by a couple of metres into the drain, the street drain. And you're already doing so much to protect your home.</p>
</details>

城市能做些什么？Anabela Bonada表示，城市可以做很多事情，而且他们正在非常努力地工作。她想表扬加拿大一些在过去几年里处理了大量洪水的城市。一些城市的基础设施比较老旧，水系统是合并的。当这些系统建造时，并没有考虑到气候变化。所以它们是为过去的降雨事件而建造的，而不是我们现在所面临的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What can the city do? There's a lot that cities can do and they're working super hard. I do want to commend a few cities in Canada that have dealt with a lot of flooding over the past few years. We have older infrastructure in some cities, so our water systems are combined. The water. When those systems were built, climate change wasn't in mind. So they were built to sustain rain events that are from the past, not what we have now.</p>
</details>

因此，更大的基础设施项目正在升级我们的水系统，她在这个夏天看到了很多。我们知道夏天是加拿大的施工季节，她看到街道被挖开，人们可能会因为街道不通而感到不高兴。但这是有原因的，而且是一个很好的理由。下次下雨时，你的道路就不会被淹了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So bigger infrastructure projects are upgrading our water systems, which I've seen a lot this summer. We know summer is construction season in Canada, and I've just seen those streets being ripped up and people might be getting upset about not having, like, their streets open. But there's a reason. Exactly. An excellent reason. Next time it rains, your roads won't be flooded.</p>
</details>

在较小的规模上，市政当局可以分发信息，告诉房主如何保护自己免受洪水侵害。最重要的一点，也是我们在新冠疫情期间讨论过的，人们喜欢外出享受大自然，维护大自然，恢复大自然。我们的**湿地**（Wetlands: 具有独特生态系统的水域和陆地过渡区域）在阻止降雨、清洁水质以及减缓水流方面非常出色，从而防止洪水发生。所以，请考虑社区中的湿地。不要在湿地上建造，要维护它们。它们为我们做了很多工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the smaller scale, municipalities can hand out information on what homeowners can do to protect themselves from flooding. And the biggest one, and the one we were talking about, you know, during Covid, people like to be outside and enjoy nature, maintaining nature, bringing back nature. So our wetlands are incredible at stopping rain, at cleaning the water too, and really slowing it down so that flooding doesn't occur. So things think about the wetlands in your communities. Let's not build over wetlands. Let's maintain them. They're doing a lot of work for us.</p>
</details>

### 资金、责任与投资回报

加拿大是否足够重视气候适应和韧性？Anabela Bonada认为，目前还不够。她认为我们正在朝着这个方向努力。由于该战略刚刚在2023年出台，实施起来比较缓慢。我们确实有更多的资金流向适应性措施，但目前的数据显示，如果我们在减缓措施上投入24美元，那么在适应性措施上只投入1美元。所以目前非常不平衡。但我们看到越来越多的资金流向它，越来越多的讨论转向保护和准备，这正是适应的含义。所以我们正在进步，但离理想状态还有点远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does Canada focus enough on climate adaptation and resilience? Not too much. I think we're getting there. So because the strategy just came out in 2023, it's it's slow to be implemented. We do have more funding going towards adaptation, but currently the numbers are looking at like if we have $24 for mitigation, we have $1 for adaptation. So it's very, very lopsided at this time. But we are seeing more and more funding go towards it. More of the conversations going towards protection and preparedness, which is what adaptation is. So we're getting there, but we're still a bit far from from being in the ideal place.</p>
</details>

谈到金钱，我们来谈谈责任。谁应该负责资助它，或者说这是谁的责任？Anabela Bonada表示，这是每个人的责任。她知道这是一个糟糕的答案，但这是一个全社会的方法。如果我们所有人——房主、企业、各级政府——都不做点什么，我们就什么也做不了。无论是气候变化减缓还是适应的资金问题，如果我们真的想找一个负责方，她会说大部分资金来自联邦政府，流向各省，但市政当局处于气候变化的最前沿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're talking about the money. Let's talk about the responsibility. Whose responsibility should it be, or is it to fund fund it? Yeah. It's everyone's. And that's a terrible answer I know, but this is a whole of society approach. So if we don't all do something, homeowners, businesses, all levels of government, we're not going to do anything. When it comes to climate change mitigation or adaptation funding wise. If we do really want to look at someone, I would say a lot of the funding does come from the federal government that goes towards the provinces, but municipalities are at the forefront of climate change.</p>
</details>

他们正在感受影响，但在各级政府中，他们的资金最少。当人们的地下室被淹时，他们往往只会说是政府的错，而不会去想是哪一级政府。因此，我们需要向市政当局提供更多的支持，才能推动这些项目的实施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're feeling the impacts and they are the least funded when it comes to levels of government and when people's basement floods, they kind of just say it's the government's fault. Without thinking which level of government. So more support to municipalities is exactly what we need in order to bring these projects around.</p>
</details>

我们讨论了野火和洪水，以及房主、企业和市政当局的责任分工。另一方面，气候适应有多少应该来自政府，有多少应该来自个人？Anabela Bonada认为这是一个五五开的比例。个人有很多可以自己做的事情。当洪水或野火发生时，受损失的是你。即使你有办法挽回一些损失，有些材料也无法替代。如果房屋被烧毁，你会听到那些故事，它们绝对是毁灭性的。人们无法替代他们失去的东西。所以很多责任都落在你身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We talked about wildfires and flooding and sort of the breakdown of the responsibilities of homeowners and businesses and municipalities. On the other end, how much of climate adaptation should be from government, how much should be from the individual? It's like a 5050. So individuals have a lot that they can do themselves. And when flooding occurs, when a wildfire occurs, it's you who's losing. Even if you have ways to regain some of the loss, some of the materials can't be replaced. If a home is burned, you'll hear the stories. They're absolutely devastating. People can't replace what they've lost. So a lot of that responsibility falls on you.</p>
</details>

但政府在加拿大拥有巨大的影响力。如果他们能创建教育项目，真正提高加拿大人的意识，Anabela Bonada在过去这个夏天与很多人交谈过，他们并不完全了解自己的风险水平，因为今年夏天野火发生在以前从未发生过的新地方。所以感觉可能只是暂时的，可能不会再发生。因此，一个大型的教育项目，政府处于理想的位置来为加拿大人实现这一点，以便他们能够理解，并提供资金来实施这些项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But government has a huge voice in Canada. So if they were to create education programs to really raise the awareness of Canadians, I've spoken to a lot of people this past summer, and they didn't fully understand their risk level because wildfire was happening in new places this summer that we haven't seen before. So it felt maybe sorry, momentary, like it might not occur again. So a big education program, the government's in the ideal position to make that happen for Canadians so that they can understand and also provide that funding in order to do the projects.</p>
</details>

### 适应性投资的回报与心理益处

主持人提到，特别是在过去几年里，很多人对历史上从未发生过的火灾或洪水毫无准备。那么，人们是否愿意承担这份责任？Anabela Bonada承认，这确实要求很高。但我们也有其他数据。例如，我们每在适应性措施上投资一美元，十年内就能获得2到10美元的**投资回报率**（Return on Investment: 投资收益与投资成本之比）。所以，即使我们对人们要求很高，其中一些事情是免费的，比如清理檐槽，你也会看到回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you say, you know, particularly over the last couple of years, a lot of people who are weren't prepared for fires or floods that historically have never occurred there. But do you think people are prepared to take on that responsibility? Some. It can be a lot to ask. Yeah, and it's a lot to ask. But it's also so we have other numbers. For example, for every dollar that we invest in adaptation, we have 2 to 10 of a return on investment over ten years. So even though we're asking a lot from people and some of it is free to do, like cleaning out your eavestroughs, you will see a return on it.</p>
</details>

这很难看到，因为如果现在没有发生洪水，你可能会想：“我为什么要这样做？”但如果真的发生了，去和那些经历过的人谈谈。我们有很多经历过洪水的人的故事。他们知道，他们已经投资使自己的家园具有防洪韧性，但他们也知道那种精神压力。所以，一旦你经历过野火、洪水这样的极端事件，要从中恢复过来是非常困难的。下次你再听到家附近有火灾时，那种感觉和对人们的精神压力，她认为如果这意味着内心的平静和对降低风险的掌控，我们并没有要求太多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's hard to see because if a flood doesn't occur right now, you're like, why am I doing this? But if it were to occur, speak to the people that have gone through it. We have lots of stories from people that have experienced flooding. They know and they have invested to make their homes flood resilient, but also they know what the mental strain is. So it's very difficult once you've gone through an extreme event like wildfire, like flooding, to recover from that, the next time that you hear there's a fire near my home again, what that feels and the mental strain on people, I don't think we're asking too much if it means peace of mind and ownership over reducing your risk.</p>
</details>

谈到情感上的代价，气候变化普遍带来了很多焦虑。这个适应和韧性框架能否帮助对抗这种焦虑，或者我们如何对抗这种焦虑？Anabela Bonada肯定地表示，绝对可以，因为它让你现在就能做一些事情来保护自己、保护你所爱的人、你的邻居。所以当我们谈论适应时，我们关注三个主要方面：野火、洪水和极端高温。如果我们谈论极端高温，它会使人生病，甚至可能致人死亡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talk about the emotional toll. There's a lot of anxiety around climate change just in general. Do you think this framework of adaptation and resilience can help combat, or how can we combat that? Absolutely, because it gives you something you can do right now to protect yourself, to protect your loved ones, your neighbours. So when we talk about adaptation, you know, we focus on the big on the three big ones. So wildfire, flooding and extreme heat. If we talk about extreme heat, what it does is make people sick and it can kill people.</p>
</details>

适应性措施让你掌握了可以做的事情。例如，仅仅是关心老年人、关心你的邻居。这意味着你可以真正降低风险并挽救生命。如果这不能减轻你的一些气候焦虑，那么她不知道还有什么能做到，因为这给了你一些已被证明能挽救生命的事情去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This puts something in your hands that you can do. Just checking, for example, on the elderly, on your neighbours. It means that you can really reduce that risk and save someone's life. If that doesn't reduce some of your climate anxiety, you know, I don't know what will because this is giving you something to do that is proven to save people's lives.</p>
