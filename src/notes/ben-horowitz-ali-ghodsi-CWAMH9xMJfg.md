### 坚守愿景与关键决策

I was like, maybe they're right. Maybe we should just sell. And I remember having that conversation with Ben, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. You can sell. You're going to make a lot of money and you'll be super successful in life, but if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, you know, I missed that one shot. That was the one thing I should have taken it all the way. Now I'll never know how far I could have taken it." Could have been. So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less.

我当时想，也许他们是对的。也许我们应该直接卖掉公司。我记得和本（Ben）有过那次对话，他说：“嘿，你想做什么都行。你可以卖掉公司，你会赚很多钱，一生都会非常成功。但如果你像我一样，你余生都会回想，错过了那一次机会。那是唯一一件我应该坚持到底的事。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。”他问：“你想带着那种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有金钱？你想做什么，我都会支持。我真的无所谓。”

Anthony: excited to bring back Boss Talk. This was a series that you guys did a few years ago on Clubhouse that was a big hit.

Anthony: 很高兴能再次推出“老板访谈”。这是你们几年前在Clubhouse上做的一个非常受欢迎的系列节目。

Ali: Yeah, we had fun. It was Ben's idea.

Ali: 是啊，我们玩得很开心。那是本的主意。

Anthony: Yeah. Excited to bring it back. So, in the spirit of Boss Talk, let's talk about the first time that you became a boss in terms of running Databricks. Let's talk about the moment in 2016 when Databricks was not—things weren't as smooth as perhaps they should have been, and we were looking for a new CEO, and Ben, you recommended Ali.

Anthony: 是的。很高兴能再次推出这个节目。那么，本着“老板访谈”的精神，我们来谈谈你第一次作为老板运营 **Databricks**（一家为数据湖仓提供数据智能平台的公司）的情形。我们来谈谈2016年，当时Databricks的运营并不像预期的那样顺利，我们正在寻找一位新的首席执行官，而本，你推荐了阿里。

Ali: First of all, kudos to Ion for building the company originally, and Ben, investing and believing in us. And then also, I kind of couldn't have done the CEO job. Ben basically babysat me the first couple years.

Ali: 首先，要感谢 Ion 最初创建了这家公司，以及本对我们的投资和信任。此外，我其实也做不好首席执行官的工作。本在最初的几年里基本上像照看孩子一样照看着我。

Ben: A short, short baby.

Ben: 一个小小的、小小的“婴儿”。

Ali: So, but I did know what was kind of wrong with the company because I had been there for two, three years, and I had seen from inside what we should change and what the issues were. But we had an open source project that actually became very successful thanks to those first two, three years.

Ali: 所以，但我确实知道公司出了什么问题，因为我已经在那儿待了两三年，我从内部看到了我们应该改变什么，以及问题出在哪里。但我们有一个开源项目，多亏了最初的两三年，它变得非常成功。

### 开源项目的双刃剑

Ali: Apache Spark became a worldwide sensation, and we could pride ourselves on the number of downloads of the software.

Ali: **Apache Spark**（一个开源的分布式计算系统）成为了全球性的轰动，我们可以为软件的下载量感到自豪。

Ben: Well, and the Spark conference.

Ben: 嗯，还有Spark大会。

Ali: Yeah, Spark conference.

Ali: 是的，Spark大会。

Anthony: Now the Data and AI conference.

Anthony: 现在是数据与人工智能大会了。

Ali: Yeah, but the problem was that, as it is often with open source, everyone's just downloading the open source version. Actually, your biggest enemy is your open source project. The main thing you have to fight in the market is, "Hey, why can't I just download the open source version? Amazon is offering it, the cloud vendors are just offering it. I'm just going to use that."

Ali: 是的，但问题在于，开源项目通常会遇到这种情况：每个人都在下载开源版本。实际上，你最大的敌人就是你的开源项目。你在市场上必须与之抗衡的主要问题是：“嘿，我为什么不能只下载开源版本呢？亚马逊在提供它，云厂商也在提供它，我直接用那个不就行了。”

Anthony: So this was the biggest challenge that Databricks had at the time, and we needed to do very serious, aggressive pivots internally, which were going to be very, very painful to lots of people, to the whole ethos of the company internally. And so I kind of knew that for almost a year. So when I got the shot, that's kind of what we started doing.

Anthony: 所以这是Databricks当时面临的最大挑战，我们内部需要进行非常严肃、激进的转型，这对很多人，对公司内部的整个精神风貌来说，都将是非常非常痛苦的。我几乎知道这一点有一年了。所以当我得到这个机会时，这就是我们开始做的事情。

Ben: The strategy was to make Spark the biggest open source thing. I mean, I can remember it on all the slides now. And then Databricks would have the best Spark. But we never—Databricks never necessarily had, we didn't do a lot to make it the best Spark or not differentiated enough. And that was kind of the first thing Ali did on the product side. And then he hired Ron Gabrisko, which that was transformational because that kind of dragged the company into the world.

Ben: 策略是让Spark成为最棒的开源项目。我记得现在所有的幻灯片上都写着这个。然后Databricks就会拥有最好的Spark。但我们从来没有——Databricks从来没有做很多工作来让它成为最好的Spark，或者说没有足够差异化。那是阿里在产品方面做的第一件事。然后他雇佣了 Ron Gabrisko，这带来了变革，因为这把公司带入了真实世界。

Anthony: So obviously that was the right decision and paid off. Maybe zooming out, Ben, you've worked with and you know all the great CEOs of our and worked with them. Where does Ali spike in? Where are his superpowers as a CEO, as a boss, that have helped contribute to the impact?

Anthony: 显然，那是个正确的决定，而且也得到了回报。本，或许我们可以把视角拉远一点，你曾与我们这个时代所有伟大的首席执行官合作过，也了解他们。阿里在哪些方面表现突出？作为一名首席执行官、一名老板，他的超能力是什么，帮助他取得了如今的影响力？

### 阿里作为CEO的超能力

Ben: I mean, Ali's really good. So I always rate CEOs. So it's like, okay, if I was running that company, would I do a better job or a worse job? And with Databricks, I'd do a way worse job. So, so he's good on many, many dimensions. So, I'd say first of all, he is a real technologist, like not a pseudo technologist, like his competitors, I'm sorry. So he really knows the product. He understands the product strategy in detail. He also ran engineering before he was CEOs. Mostly what I worked on him with in the early days was just go-to-market and BD. And he's really good at both of those. That's where we had to catch up. Snowflake had an amazing go-to-market. And then we needed a big deal with kind of big partners. And every time I got him a little BD tutor, John O'Farrell, who did a nice job, came in and kind of taught Olly about how you structure a deal, how you do things. But he learned everything so fast. And then probably the thing that he does that is, I wish I could get all our CEOs to do, is he doesn't hesitate. He trusts his eye. He'll see something and he doesn't know if it's right. And so if you look at the strategy changes Databricks has had, one big one was building a data warehouse. That is a pretty big swing and a seemingly quixotic, insane idea given where they were. But he both knew—he's paranoid enough that he knew that that could be an issue, and then he trusted himself enough to go get deep enough to decide whether to do it or not, as opposed to ignore it like, "These guys are trying to kill me. I don't want to see it," which is what a lot of CEOs do. But there's a lot of elements to that job. It's a very complicated job.

Ben: 阿里真的很棒。我总是这样评价首席执行官：如果我来经营这家公司，我会做得更好还是更糟？对于Databricks，我会做得糟糕得多。所以，他在很多很多方面都很出色。首先，他是一位真正的技术专家，不是像他的竞争对手那样的伪技术专家，抱歉。他真的了解产品，他详细了解产品策略。在担任首席执行官之前，他还负责过工程部门。早期我主要和他一起做的就是市场推广和业务发展（**BD**：Business Development，业务拓展）。他在这两方面都非常出色。那是我们需要追赶的地方。Snowflake拥有出色的市场推广。然后我们需要与大型合作伙伴达成大宗交易。每次我都会给他找一位小小的BD导师，John O'Farrell，他做得很好，来教阿里如何构建交易，如何处理事情。但他学得非常快。然后他做的另一件事，我希望我们所有的首席执行官都能做到，那就是他从不犹豫。他相信自己的判断。他会看到一些事情，即使不确定是否正确。所以如果你看看Databricks的战略变化，其中一个重大变化是构建数据仓库。考虑到他们当时所处的位置，这是一个相当大的转变，一个看似异想天开的疯狂想法。但他既知道——他足够谨慎，知道那可能是一个问题，然后又足够信任自己，深入研究，决定是否去做，而不是像许多首席执行官那样忽视它，认为“这些人想干掉我，我不想看到它”。但这份工作有很多要素。这是一份非常复杂的工作。

Anthony: Ali, talk about more about the journey about evolving from an academic, a technologist to someone commercial. It's a journey our CEOs go through. Talk about what it was like for you in the context of what others can learn from it.

Anthony: 阿里，多谈谈你从学者、技术专家转型为商业人士的历程。这是我们许多首席执行官都会经历的旅程。结合其他人可以从中学习的经验，谈谈你当时的感受。

### 从学者到CEO的学习与成长

Ali: Yeah, I mean, we were in academia, so we were scientists. And then I led engineering and product, so you got to learn how to build a product and get product-market fit. And then I became CEO afterwards. Each of these has different sorts of challenges. I think that in all of them, the thing that is in common is that you really have to understand and be extremely good at the task at hand. And so number one, admit that you don't actually know everything about the job. So, like, you know, first step of Anonymous Alcoholics, like, admit you have a problem. Okay. And then number two, be a student and learn everything you can about it. Go all the way down to the details and try to learn from the best. And then work your butt off, like you know nothing. You're zero. It's like you know nothing about writing reliable software. So I think for that's—I would say that's was the same thing I tried to learn. I tried to network with the best heads of engineering, with the best heads of products. I try to read every book. I got as much as I could out of Ben and Mark. I read all of their blogs, all of their books, everybody else's. But then you do search and you start—search firms are really great at getting you to meet who's the number one product manager by reputation in the market right now. Can you get 30 minutes with that person? Just sit down. They're not going to join you because your company is too crappy and too small. Can you get 30 minutes with them? Can you get a dinner with them? Can you get a breakfast with them? And then just ask them lots and lots and lots of dumb questions, and they'll tell you. They'll happily just tell you like, "Hey, here's how I run. Here's how I do it. The other guys are wrong." And then they'll give you a playbook, and you can go compare it. You can go to the next person and say, "Hey, this is the playbook I heard from like, "No, no, that's totally wrong. You don't do it that way. Here's how I do it." And then very soon you learn enough. And if you really have grit and you work hard, you're going to be able to do great things. That's about you yourself. But also, if you hire a great team, because as a leader, you alone can't do much. So can you hire the best people out there? So that's also part of that. Do you know what great looks like? Have you interviewed all the best people? And then can you now sell them and get the best people to come work for you? Once you start assembling a team of excellent people, then they will uplift you.

Ali: 是的，我的意思是，我们当时在学术界，所以我们是科学家。然后我领导了工程和产品部门，所以你必须学习如何构建产品并实现产品与市场的契合。之后我才成为首席执行官。每一个阶段都有不同的挑战。我认为在所有这些阶段中，共通之处在于你必须真正理解并极其擅长手头的任务。所以第一点，承认你并不真正了解这份工作的一切。就像匿名戒酒会的第一个步骤一样，承认你有问题。好的。然后第二点，成为一名学生，学习所有你能学到的东西。深入细节，努力向最优秀的人学习。然后拼命工作，就像你一无所知一样。你是零。就像你对编写可靠的软件一无所知。所以我认为这是——我想说这也是我努力学习的相同之处。我努力与最优秀的工程主管、最优秀的产品主管建立联系。我努力阅读每一本书。我从本（Ben）和马克（Mark）那里尽可能多地获取知识。我阅读了他们所有的博客、所有的书，以及其他所有人的。但随后你开始寻找——猎头公司非常擅长帮你结识目前在市场上享有盛誉的第一产品经理。你能和那个人聊30分钟吗？就坐下来。他们不会加入你的公司，因为你的公司太糟糕、太小了。你能和他们聊30分钟吗？你能和他们共进晚餐吗？你能和他们共进早餐吗？然后就问他们很多很多愚蠢的问题，他们会告诉你。他们会很乐意告诉你，比如：“嘿，我是这样做的。我是这样做的。其他人都是错的。”然后他们会给你一个行动方案，你可以去比较。你可以去问下一个人，说：“嘿，这是我听来的行动方案，比如：‘不不，那完全错了。你不能那样做。我是这样做的。’”然后很快你就能学到足够多的东西。如果你真的有毅力并且努力工作，你就能做出伟大的事情。这是关于你自己。但同时，如果你能组建一支优秀的团队，因为作为领导者，你一个人做不了太多。所以你能雇佣到最优秀的人吗？这也是其中的一部分。你知道优秀是什么样子吗？你面试过所有最优秀的人吗？然后你能说服他们，让最优秀的人来为你工作吗？一旦你开始组建一支由优秀人才组成的团队，他们就会提升你。

Ali: This is a managerial leverage that I learned from Ben, which is from High Output Management by Andy Grove. But it's basically, are they so great that you're learning from them? It's like Ali was a great head of engineering, but actually he was a great head of engineering because the people that worked underneath me were doing amazing things, and that was I was just standing on their shoulders. So you just have to do that, and you have to instill everybody else to do that recursively so that you end up with a just amazing killer team, and you got to continue doing that. Now you have to—okay, for engineering, it wasn't actually that hard because I had written a lot of software. But now you're CEO, so now you have to do that for marketing. You have to do that for sales, where they were super helpful because they had done it with LoudCloud and Opsware, so they knew how to build a **B2B** (Business-to-Business: 企业对企业的商业模式) machine, how the game was played. But you have to do it again, but now you're doing it in a field where you're really clueless, and also probably all of your instincts are wrong, and your intuition is completely wrong. So can you be clairvoyant and see the truth, or do you want to lie to yourself? And that's where I think a lot of founders make mistakes. They'll do well in their own archetype. When they have to step outside of their own archetype, they make a mistake. They hire people that are like their own archetype in other roles where that could be lethal.

Ali: 这是我从本（Ben）那里学到的一种管理杠杆，它来自于安迪·格鲁夫（Andy Grove）的《高产出管理》。它基本上是问，他们是否优秀到让你能从他们身上学习？就像阿里曾是一位优秀的工程主管，但实际上他之所以优秀，是因为在我手下工作的人都在做着了不起的事情，我只是站在他们的肩膀上。所以你必须这样做，并且你必须递归地灌输给其他人也这样做，这样你最终会拥有一支令人惊叹的、强大的团队，而且你必须继续这样做。现在你必须——好的，对于工程来说，这实际上并不难，因为我写过很多软件。但现在你是首席执行官了，所以你必须为市场营销部门这样做。你必须为销售部门这样做，他们在那里提供了巨大的帮助，因为他们曾与 **LoudCloud**（本·霍洛维茨共同创立的网络服务公司）和 **Opsware**（一家软件公司）合作过，所以他们知道如何构建一个 B2B 机器，知道游戏规则。但你必须再次这样做，但现在你是在一个你完全 clueless 的领域，而且很可能你所有的直觉都是错误的，你的判断也完全错误。所以你能否有预见性地看到真相，还是想欺骗自己？我认为很多创始人都在这里犯了错误。他们在自己擅长的领域做得很好。当他们不得不走出自己的舒适区时，他们就会犯错。他们会在其他角色中雇佣与自己类型相似的人，而这可能是致命的。

Anthony: So, by the way, that's how we started Databricks. I think everybody was a PhD in computer science who was running anything.

Anthony: 顺便说一句，我们Databricks就是这样起步的。当时，我认为所有管理任何事务的人都拥有计算机科学博士学位。

Ben: Yeah, like including sales.

Ben: 是的，包括销售部门。

Anthony: Yeah.

Anthony: 是的。

Ben: Yeah, that's probably the number one mistake is you just go, "Okay, well, like I'm an engineer, so I want a sales guy who can talk to me and understands engineering." And that's like, "Well, that's not a really good criteria for sales." One thing that I'm good at is rather than telling somebody, you know, that's stupid and hurting their feelings or so forth, I'll ask them a really messed up question. Actually, I did it in a board meeting. I said, "Well, like, could you help me with the math on this?" Because I don't understand the math. Actually, it was worse. I said, "Help me with the—I'm just trying to understand basic math. You have all these numbers on the slide."

Ben: 是的，这可能是头号错误，你只是说：“好吧，我是一名工程师，所以我想要一个能和我交流并理解工程的销售人员。”这就像是：“嗯，这不是一个真正好的销售标准。”我擅长的一件事是，与其告诉某人，你知道，那很愚蠢，伤害他们的感情等等，我不如问他们一个非常棘手的问题。实际上，我在一次董事会议上就这么做了。我说：“嗯，你能帮我算算这个吗？”因为我不懂数学。实际上更糟糕。我说：“帮我算算——我只是想理解基本的数学。你的幻灯片上有很多数字。”

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: "And if you said that your conversion ratio is 5%. But I can't divide any of those two numbers to get 5%." And then the person freaked out and said, "No, no, don't freak out. Just tell me which of the two numbers do I divide to get 5%?" Because I've divided all of them and none of them is five.

Ben: “如果你说你的转化率是5%。但我无法用那两个数字中的任何一个相除得到5%。”然后那个人吓坏了，我说：“不不，别慌。你告诉我，我应该用哪两个数字相除才能得到5%？”因为我把它们都除了一遍，没有一个结果是5。

Ali: Like, am I going to be fired?

Ali: 就像，我会被解雇吗？

Ben: So, so he does a much better version of that, which is he'll like if somebody's really, really screwed something up or messing, he'll go, "How do you think it's going?" And I was like, since he told me that, I was like, "Oh, yeah, that's a better way to do it. That's even better."

Ben: 所以，他做得比这好得多，就是如果有人真的搞砸了什么，他会问：“你觉得进展如何？”自从他告诉我之后，我就觉得：“哦，是的，那是更好的做法。那甚至更好。”

Anthony: So, yeah.

Anthony: 嗯，是的。

Ben: Yeah, he's a very good student.

Ben: 是的，他是一个非常好的学生。

### 有效反馈与管理艺术

Ali: Can I reframe that? So I think that's a—you know, there's this book called Radical Candor, and I think people take it too far and they misunderstand it and so on. But I think the essence of that book is that if feedback—if, you know, are you criticizing me?

Ali: 我能重新定义一下吗？我认为这是一个——你知道，有一本书叫《彻底坦率》，我认为人们把它过度解读了，误解了等等。但我认为那本书的精髓在于，如果反馈——如果你知道，你是在批评我吗？

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: Are you saying I'm stupid? I can't do the vision because my point is not about the 5%. I was trying to make a different point, and now you're just—this is a cheap shot, and now I'm hurt, and I think, by the way, I think you're wrong. It's not five. I said six and a half. So are you criticizing me or is it like, "No, no, I'm here to help you. I can like not help you, but if you beg me for help, maybe I'll help you." So, which of the two modes? So, if you can get people into the mode of like, "Oh, wow. I'm being helped, like they're helping me, and I'm going to get further ahead in my career, and I'll be more successful." Please, no, no, no, please don't leave. Come back and tell me more like, because I'm taking notes here. So, if you can flip to that, and I think a lot of feedback can be recast into, "I'm just here to help you, but feel free to completely ignore this advice. But if you want to be really successful, if you want to get that job or if you want to get that project next time, if you did it this way, you probably would have had a higher probability of getting that, but I don't care. You do whatever you want." And then people are much more receptive. They're like, "No, no, no, please. I want to know more."

Ali: 你是在说我愚蠢吗？我无法实现这个愿景，因为我的重点不是那5%。我当时想表达的是另一个观点，而你现在只是——这是在偷袭，我现在很受伤，而且我认为，顺便说一句，我认为你错了。不是5，我说的是6.5。所以你是在批评我，还是说：“不不，我来这里是为了帮助你。我不是非要帮你，但如果你恳求我帮助，也许我会帮你。”那么，是这两种模式中的哪一种？所以，如果你能让人们进入这样一种模式，就是：“哦，哇。我正在被帮助，他们正在帮助我，我的职业生涯会更进一步，我会更成功。”请，不不不，请别走。回来告诉我更多，因为我正在这里做笔记。所以，如果你能转变成那种模式，我认为很多反馈都可以重新表述为：“我只是来帮助你的，但你可以完全不理会这个建议。但如果你想真正成功，如果你下次想得到那份工作或者那个项目，如果你这样做，你成功的可能性可能会更高，但我无所谓。你想怎么做就怎么做。”然后人们会更容易接受。他们会说：“不不不，请告诉我更多。”

Ben: Yeah, well, and then just the frequency of it, I think, helps a lot, too, where if I see you once a year at your review and I tell you what's wrong with you, you're going to be offended. No matter what it is, no matter how wrong it is, no matter how correct I am, it's going to be offensive. But if every day if I see you doing something I don't like, I go, "No, don't do it that way. Do it this way." Then you get desensitized to it. And so I think the mistake a lot of particular engineers make is they just don't say what they think when they think it because they're afraid of hurting someone's feelings. But that's how you save their feelings because they're used to you. You're always doing that, and you're doing it with everybody. They see it. They're like, "Oh, yeah, Ben's an ass. He's always doing this, but that's how he is, and that's how we work, and it's no problem." As opposed to, you know, the hammer and you try and put in a crap sandwich. "Oh, you do this really well, but this is all screwed up, and this is good." And people are like, "Well, so now in my written review, you're telling me that for the first time this is all screwed up? Screw you." Yeah, this is very common, and you can see this in the industry that people—it's like the extreme version of it is like they get fired.

Ben: 是的，而且我认为反馈的频率也有很大帮助。如果我一年只在你的绩效评估中见到你一次，然后告诉你你哪里做得不对，你肯定会感到被冒犯。无论是什么事，无论我错得多离谱，无论我多么正确，都会让人觉得不舒服。但如果我每天都看到你做我不喜欢的事情，然后我立刻说：“不，不要那样做，这样做。”那么你就会对此脱敏。所以，我认为很多工程师常犯的错误是，他们想到什么的时候不立刻说出来，因为他们害怕伤害别人的感情。但那样做反而能保护他们的感情，因为他们习惯了你。你总是那样做，对每个人都那样。他们看到了，就会想：“哦，是的，本就是个混蛋。他总是这样，但这就是他的风格，我们就是这样工作的，没问题。”而不是那种，你知道，像用锤子砸人，然后你试图用“屎三明治”来包装。“哦，你这方面做得很好，但这全都搞砸了，不过这方面又很好。”然后人们就会想：“好吧，所以现在在我的书面评估中，你第一次告诉我这些全都搞砸了？去你的吧。”是的，这非常普遍，你在行业中可以看到，人们——最极端的情况就是他们被解雇了。

Ali: And then head of HR talks to them, and they're like, "Do you know, do you see this coming? It was obvious, right? You knew this." "No, I had no idea. Like, wait, you didn't get any feedback on this?" "Uh, no. I only got thumbs up all along for like a whole year, so I'm in shock." This is super common.

Ali: 然后人力资源主管和他们谈话，他们会说：“你知道，你预料到会这样吗？这很明显，对吧？你早就知道了。”“不，我完全不知道。等等，你没有收到这方面的任何反馈吗？”“呃，没有。我一整年都只收到赞扬，所以我很震惊。”这太常见了。

Anthony: So maybe on the topic of managing talent, you have this incredibly high-intensity culture at Databricks. And there was this thread recently in our CEO thread where they asked everyone, but you had a great response on, "Hey, we have 50 people. How do we scale? We have this culture of 996, right? You work 99 six days a week." How have you scaled that intensity well into 10,000 employees?

Anthony: 那么，关于人才管理这个话题，Databricks 有着令人难以置信的高强度文化。最近在我们的首席执行官讨论串中，大家都在问这个问题，而你有一个很棒的回答，内容是：“嘿，我们有50个人。我们如何扩展？我们有这种996文化，对吧？你一周工作六天，从早上9点到晚上9点。”你是如何将这种强度成功扩展到一万名员工的？

### 高强度文化与领导力

Ali: I think, start with, you know, setting the tone at the top. If you're the hardest working person, everything will take care of itself from there on. If you're not working hard, it's very hard. It's a double standard. Ben has a whole book about that, which is, you know, what you do is who you are is the whole title of the book, right? So it's like, if you are working extremely, extremely hard, the rest of the organization is also as well. Are you calling people at 9:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m.? Are you working weekends? Do they expect you—not that you expect them and you're going to be angry and yell at them if they're not dropping everything for you, not that. But the fact that they just know that Ali is working 24/7 and he's working seven days a week, and he's working at 11:00 p.m. or 2:00 a.m. or whatever it is. I think that gets a lot of it done. The second thing I would say is, you can vet for this when you hire people. And the easiest way to vet for it because, you know, well, you got to be careful with it because the people who say they're going to work the hardest are not the ones who work the hardest.

Ali: 我认为，首先要从高层做起，设定基调。如果你是工作最努力的人，那么一切都会水到渠成。如果你不努力工作，那就很难了。这是一个双重标准。本有一整本书都在讲这个，书名就是“你做什么，你就是谁”，对吧？所以，如果你工作极其努力，组织的其他人也会一样。你会在晚上9点、10点打电话给别人吗？你会在周末工作吗？他们是否期待你——不是你期待他们，如果他们不为你放下一切，你就会生气并冲他们大喊大叫，不是那样。而是他们知道阿里每周七天，每天24小时都在工作，他会在晚上11点或凌晨2点工作，无论什么时候。我认为这能完成很多事情。我要说的第二件事是，你可以在招聘人员时进行考察。最简单的考察方法，因为，嗯，你必须小心，因为那些说自己会最努力工作的人，往往不是最努力工作的人。

Ben: It's the opposite.

Ben: 正好相反。

Ali: Yeah, 100% true, right? So the best way to vet for this is to do backdoors. Ask people, "If I ask someone, 'Hey, how was Sarah? Did you like, was she great?'" They're always going to say, "Yeah, she was great." But they're going to be much more honest if you ask them like, "Hey, how much does she grind the midnight oil? Is she like—" And they'll tell you right away. It's like, "Oh my God, she works like crazy." Or, "She's, I mean, I think she has a good balance." You can like suss that out very easily from backdoors references. People will remember the people and they'll just offer it up and say, "Oh, that person was like nuts. They were like working 24/7." So, I think that way you can get people that are hardworking. By the way, I don't want to overemphasize. I don't think everything is just work harder. You have to also work smarter. And I think that you want to make sure that it's sustainable. I can work insanely hard. I'm motivated. Everybody has a different threshold for how hard they can work. I don't think you want a culture where people are burning out. I think you really should avoid that. In fact, at Databricks, I'm very often going in and saying, "Hey, this team, your scores are really bad on work-life balance. What are you doing about it?" Or, "You guys should take several days off," or "You should do some offsites," or "Do something." We actually go in and if we see that there's some groups—and other groups at Databricks, their work-life balance scores are like 100%. They're like slacking off. So then it's kind of the opposite. But I do think that you can vet for that. And I think that also setting the expectation. I would say, one of my competitors, Frank Slootman, wrote a book called Amp It Up. It's a great book on how you get execution into a company, like getting a high-performance culture where everybody's always trying to excel and do better and better. Sort of that kind of culture into a company. That's a good book if you want to just study, and he's doing it at scale at bigger companies. So I think that's highly recommended reading as well.

Ali: 是的，百分之百正确，对吧？所以最好的考察方法是进行背景调查。问人们：“如果我问某人，‘嘿，莎拉怎么样？你喜欢她吗？她很棒吗？’”他们总是会说：“是的，她很棒。”但如果你问他们：“嘿，她熬夜工作到什么程度？她是不是——”他们会立刻告诉你。他们会说：“哦，天哪，她工作起来像疯了一样。”或者，“她，我的意思是，我认为她有一个很好的平衡。”你可以很容易地通过背景调查的推荐人来发现这些。人们会记住那些人，他们会主动说出来：“哦，那个人简直疯了。他们几乎24小时都在工作。”所以，我认为通过这种方式你可以找到勤奋的人。顺便说一句，我不想过分强调。我并不认为所有事情都只是更努力地工作。你还必须更聪明地工作。而且我认为你希望确保它是可持续的。我可以疯狂地努力工作。我很有动力。每个人对他们能工作多努力都有不同的承受阈值。我认为你不会想要一种让员工精疲力尽的文化。我认为你真的应该避免那种情况。事实上，在Databricks，我经常会去说：“嘿，这个团队，你们在工作与生活平衡方面的得分真的很差。你们打算怎么做？”或者，“你们应该休几天假，”或者“你们应该出去团建一下，”或者“做点什么。”我们实际上会去，如果我们看到有些团队——而Databricks的其他团队，他们的工作与生活平衡得分是100%。他们就像在偷懒。所以情况就有点相反了。但我确实认为你可以考察这一点。而且我认为也要设定预期。我想说，我的一个竞争对手，弗兰克·斯洛特曼（Frank Slootman），写了一本名为《加速》（Amp It Up）的书。这是一本关于如何让公司执行力强劲的好书，比如如何建立一种高绩效文化，让每个人都不断努力超越自我，做得越来越好。将这种文化融入公司。如果你想学习，那是一本好书，而且他正在更大的公司中大规模地实践。所以我认为这也是非常值得推荐的读物。

Ben: Yeah, and I think a lot of it at his scale ends up being things like organizational design and are people feeling like they're having an impact? If people are feeling like they're having an impact and they're good, then they'll work very hard. But if you're in some kind of weird three-legged race that the CEO has constructed where everybody's got dependencies on everybody else, it just doesn't matter. You'll just have a lot of people go like, "I know if I work hard, it's not going to make a difference. So why would I do that?" And you can't overcome that with "rah-rah" and "lead by example" or anything else. That's just fundamental to how it is. And you see in like, look in any company of any scale, even at our scale, there are some groups who really can have an impact and work extremely hard, and then groups who have lesser impact will work less hard, and you just see that.

Ben: 是的，我认为在他那种规模的公司，很多事情最终都归结为组织设计，以及员工是否觉得他们正在产生影响。如果人们觉得他们正在产生影响并且他们很优秀，那么他们就会非常努力地工作。但如果你处于首席执行官构建的某种奇怪的三人四足赛跑中，每个人都依赖于其他人，那根本无关紧要。你会看到很多人会说：“我知道我努力工作也改变不了什么。那我为什么要这样做？”你无法用“加油”和“以身作则”之类的东西来克服这一点。这只是事情的根本。你会在任何规模的公司中看到这一点，即使在我们这个规模，也有些团队确实能产生影响并极其努力地工作，而那些影响力较小的团队则会工作得不那么努力，你就是会看到这种情况。

Ali: You know, people who are motivated and they feel excited about work, and they don't see the impact that they're having, they're going to work way, way, way harder versus if you're demoralized and you feel like it's not going well, I'm not having an impact, I don't have any autonomy. Then you're not going to—you just don't want even you're kind of depressed sitting down working. I do think there's one thing here where leaders can really help, which is to make your team feel like they're winning and that they're doing a great job. You can ask more from people, but if I feel like, "Hey, I'm losing, and everything we're doing is wrong, and I'm putting in all these hours, and it's stupid," what's the point of this? Then people don't want to work. So I think it's like feeling like we're winning, like we're the winning team. We're winning, and wow, they're expecting more from me. So then I think you can get—you need that motivation in people.

Ali: 你知道，那些有动力、对工作感到兴奋的人，如果他们看不到自己正在产生的影响，他们会更加努力地工作；反之，如果你士气低落，觉得事情进展不顺利，自己没有影响力，也没有任何自主权，那么你就会——你甚至不想工作，你只是沮丧地坐着工作。我确实认为领导者可以在这里提供帮助，那就是让你的团队感觉他们正在赢，并且他们做得很好。你可以向人们提出更高的要求，但如果我感觉：“嘿，我正在输，我们所做的一切都是错的，我投入了所有这些时间，这很愚蠢。”这有什么意义呢？那么人们就不想工作了。所以我认为这就像感觉我们正在赢，我们是胜利的团队。我们正在赢，哇，他们对我有更高的期望。那么我想你就能获得——你需要人们拥有这种动力。

Ben: Yeah, which is why, by the way, the hard job is when you aren't winning.

Ben: 是的，顺便说一句，这就是为什么当你没有赢的时候，工作会变得很艰难。

Ali: Yeah, to get the output, like, particularly in Silicon Valley, because you're battling attrition this and that, and to get things on the right track, that takes a whole different kind of level of technique and storytelling and show you how you could be winning and all that kind of stuff that gets very, very complicated.

Ali: 是的，要取得成果，尤其是在硅谷，因为你正在与人员流失等问题作斗争，要让事情步入正轨，这需要完全不同层面的技巧和讲故事的能力，向你展示你如何才能获胜，所有这些都会变得非常非常复杂。

Ben: We've both done that, right?

Ben: 我们都做过，对吧？

Ali: Yeah, there's been phases in our company's lives where we weren't winning.

Ali: 是的，我们公司历史上也有过一些阶段，我们并没有获胜。

Ben: Yeah, I mean, especially, you know, this the story you had in Heart about hard things, which is probably the best business book I've read, which I read, by the way, before starting Databricks, and influenced us a lot. Those are super important. Yeah, that's that's the difficult, that's such an important point because even if you're winning, people got to feel like that. But if you're not winning, getting them to feel like you're winning is, we have a path to winning.

Ben: 是的，我的意思是，尤其是，你知道，你在《艰难的真相》中讲述的关于艰难事物的故事，那可能是我读过的最好的商业书籍，顺便说一句，我在创办Databricks之前就读过它，它对我们影响很大。那些非常重要。是的，那是困难的，那是如此重要的一点，因为即使你正在赢，人们也必须有那种感觉。但如果你没有赢，让他们感觉你正在赢，那就是我们有一条通往胜利的道路。

Ali: Yeah, we have a path.

Ali: 是的，我们有一条路。

Ben: We have a, you know, and it's like rock solid. It's going to work. But it demands sacrifice from all of us. And there is no feeling as good as when you're not winning and then you get it to winning. That's the best feeling. You can't replicate that once you're super successful. You never can quite get that feeling again.

Ben: 我们有一个，你知道，它就像磐石一样坚固。它会奏效。但它需要我们所有人的牺牲。而且没有什么感觉比当你没有赢，然后你把它带向胜利时更好的了。那是最好的感觉。一旦你非常成功，你就无法再复制那种感觉了。你再也无法完全获得那种感觉了。

Anthony: Yeah, that's true.

Anthony: 是的，没错。

Ben: But you also never feel that horrible pain again.

Ben: 但你也不会再感受到那种可怕的痛苦了。

Anthony: Well, it's easier to be the underdog in some ways, right? You have nothing to lose.

Anthony: 嗯，从某些方面来说，作为弱者更容易，对吧？你没有什么可失去的。

Ben: In some ways, in most ways, not.

Ben: 从某些方面来说是，但从大多数方面来说不是。

### 深入细节与高效管理

Anthony: Well, I want to explore this leading from the top because that was kind of the first thing you started with. We actually hired an ex-Databricks employee to A16Z. So, we have some inside scoop on your leadership style. And one of the things he said was, you have this, and Ben sort of touched on this too, but you have this amazing ability to be strategic, help your team focus, but you're also very in the weeds. You're giving product feedback, you respond to emails super quickly. And product launch emails, no matter how small they are, you'll respond, "Congrats," which he found hugely motivating. How do you do all that? And where do you fly high, where do you fly low?

Anthony: 好的，我想探讨一下这种自上而下的领导方式，因为这是你一开始就提到的。我们实际上雇佣了一位前 Databricks 员工到 A16Z（一家风险投资公司）。所以，我们对你的领导风格有一些内幕消息。他提到的一点是，你拥有这种惊人的能力——本也提到了这一点——既能制定战略，帮助团队聚焦，但你也非常注重细节。你会提供产品反馈，回复邮件速度超快。而且无论产品发布邮件多么微小，你都会回复“恭喜”，这让他觉得非常有动力。你是如何做到这一切的？你什么时候高瞻远瞩，什么时候又深入细节呢？

Ali: Yeah, by the way, I respond even to progress reports on all those products, and I follow them in detail, every one of them. I try to respond to every product. But look, I think this is if you're just going to fly high and give high-level inspirational speeches and then you'll trust and you'll delegate to people, it's not going to work. So my way is, you know, you got to get in the weeds. You got to understand—this is back to what I said at the very beginning, like, how do you become great at head of engineering? How do you hire a great head of marketing? The only way you can do that is by being really excellent at it. So you need to study the game and become the best. So I try to stay, you know, stay tuned to all of these things.

Ali: 是的，顺便说一句，我甚至会回复所有这些产品的进度报告，而且我会详细跟踪每一个。我尽量回复每一个产品。但是，你看，我认为如果你只是高高在上，发表一些鼓舞人心的高层演讲，然后信任并授权给员工，那是行不通的。所以我的方式是，你必须深入细节。你必须理解——这又回到了我一开始说的，比如，你如何成为一名优秀的工程主管？你如何招聘一名优秀的市场主管？唯一的方法就是你必须非常擅长这些。所以你需要研究这个领域并成为最优秀的人。所以我努力保持对所有这些事情的关注。

Anthony: There's this quote, "If you do everything, you will win." And then the question is, have you done everything?

Anthony: 有句话说：“如果你做所有事情，你就会赢。”那么问题是，你是否已经做了所有事情？

Ali: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So yeah, so you just—it takes a lot of effort. You need to learn all your keyboard shortcuts. But I think that's—you know, people feel motivated that, "Hey, I have like direct relationship." We used to say, we used to have one of the culture principles, "Hey, be a co-founder." And we don't want to have any employees at Databricks. We just want co-founders. So, and the key point was like, "Hey, you're kind of the owner of this company. You're not just a renter. Come here and yeah, we can talk about it, and you can suggest an idea. You might have just joined and you're straight out of school. You might have a great idea for a product. Tell me about it. I'm happy to push it." And so, it's making people feel like they have an impact and they're inspired. Back to Ben's point, then it's going to be much more exciting for them than following some bureaucracy. So, I don't follow the bureaucracy basically. I go talk to anyone I like. I try to go to the person that is actually the closest to the work that's being done at any given time.

Ali: 完全正确。完全正确。完全正确。所以，是的，这需要付出很多努力。你需要掌握所有的键盘快捷键。但我认为，你知道，人们会因为“嘿，我有一个直接的关系”而感到有动力。我们以前常说，我们有一个文化原则：“嘿，成为一名联合创始人。”我们不希望Databricks有任何员工。我们只想要联合创始人。所以，关键点是：“嘿，你有点像这家公司的所有者。你不仅仅是一个租客。来这里，是的，我们可以谈谈，你可以提出一个想法。你可能刚刚加入，刚毕业。你可能有一个很棒的产品想法。告诉我吧。我很乐意推动它。”所以，这让人们觉得他们有影响力，并且受到启发。回到本的观点，那样对他们来说会比遵循一些官僚主义更令人兴奋，对吧？所以，我基本上不遵循官僚主义。我喜欢和任何人交谈。我尽量去找在任何特定时间实际最接近工作的人。

Ben: But there are some tricks and rules around how you do that without breaking the whole organization. So you can't just willingly talk to anyone. But yeah, that's part of it.

Ben: 但也有一些技巧和规则，说明你如何在不破坏整个组织的情况下做到这一点。所以你不能随意和任何人交谈。但是的，那是其中的一部分。

Anthony: Yeah, you listening and giving direction is very different on that. If you give direction, you can cause a lot of chaos. But if you go talk to people, you listen to understand the problem, and then send it back down the chain of command, it tends to work very, very well. But look, generally, if you're a CEO and you don't fly low and fast, it's going to be a mess because you never get the truth, because the truth never makes it to you through your people. If I go talk to Ali's executive staff about what's going on in their organization or anybody's, first of all, they're going to spin it. Second of all, they don't actually know. And so you can't—you need to help them debug their organizations because they've got a million things going on. They're also kind of going to the problem, going to the bottleneck, trying to figure out what's happening. And so that it's just a very unreliable source of information. All the knowledge in a company is with the individual contributors that are doing the work and the customers. There's no knowledge with the people who are talking to you as CEO, who are on your staff. That's not the way information moves. And so you got to be—now he's like super fast, and which enables him to go super low. But in any given time, the way to think about it as a CEO is it's not like you're spending the exact amount of attention to HR as you are to the key engineering project as you are to the key kind of sales competitive deals. You don't address everything evenly. You can never do that. It's just a bad idea. Now, you'll probably get to everything eventually, but you're not spending the same amount of time on every single department. The org chart is not the way that company works. It's just a communication architecture.

Anthony: 是的，你倾听和给出方向在这方面大不相同。如果你给出方向，可能会造成很多混乱。但如果你去和人们交谈，倾听以理解问题，然后将其反馈给指挥链，这样往往会非常非常有效。但总的来说，如果你是一名首席执行官，而不深入细节并快速行动，那就会一团糟，因为你永远得不到真相，因为真相永远不会通过你的员工传达到你那里。如果我去和阿里的高管团队谈论他们组织中正在发生的事情，或者任何人的组织，首先，他们会扭曲事实。其次，他们实际上并不知道。所以你不能——你需要帮助他们调试他们的组织，因为他们有很多事情要做。他们也在处理问题，处理瓶颈，试图弄清楚发生了什么。所以那只是一个非常不可靠的信息来源。公司中所有的知识都掌握在那些正在做工作的个体贡献者和客户手中。那些作为首席执行官与你交谈的员工，他们身上并没有知识。信息不是那样流动的。所以你必须——现在他行动超级快，这使他能够深入到最低层。但在任何特定时间，作为首席执行官的思考方式是，你不会对人力资源投入与对关键工程项目或关键销售竞争性交易完全相同的关注。你不会平均处理所有事情。你永远做不到。那是个糟糕的主意。现在，你最终可能会处理所有事情，但你不会在每个部门都花费相同的时间。组织架构图并不是公司运作的方式。它只是一种沟通架构。

Ali: Yeah, I think the best way I would say it is like it's kind of like a T, and you want to be broad, and then you have the leg that goes down and goes really, really deep. But you want to do that anchoring. And the key thing is to have a really good priority order of what's most important and kind of drop everything else. Like, you know, you drop that T and go really, really low. It might be HR. I might be deep diving all the way down to HR, looking at our HR handbook, our policy, everything. Like, who was this person? What happened? Why is this happening in that group? What's going on in that group? What's the culture in that group? What happened here? You might want to do that. It might be existential for your company, as we've seen some companies went under because of HR problems, or ethical issues that were going on. So I think having a really good priority order is really important. I think some execs, they just want to have a perfect ducks in a row. "I have my weekly one-on-ones, I have my weekly staff meeting, I have my weekly this," and then I do this, and then we follow the rules and we do all of this. And then that's like just like the top part of the T. And then there's nothing that goes deep. And that's the issue, I think.

Ali: 是的，我认为最好的比喻是它就像一个“T”字，你希望广阔，然后有一条腿向下，深入到非常非常深。但你希望做到那种锚定。关键是要有一个非常好的优先级顺序，知道什么是最重要的，然后放弃其他一切。就像，你知道，你放下那个“T”，深入到非常非常低层。它可能是人力资源部。我可能会深入到人力资源部的最底层，查看我们的人力资源手册、政策，所有的一切。比如，这个人是谁？发生了什么？为什么这个团队会发生这种情况？那个团队正在发生什么？那个团队的文化是什么？这里发生了什么？你可能会想这样做。这可能对你的公司来说是生死攸关的，正如我们看到一些公司因为人力资源问题或正在发生的道德问题而倒闭。所以我认为有一个非常好的优先级顺序非常重要。我认为有些高管，他们只是想把所有事情都安排得井井有条。“我有每周一对一会议，我有每周员工会议，我有每周这个，”然后我做这个，然后我们遵循规则，我们做所有这些。然后那就像“T”字的顶部。然后就没有深入的东西了。我认为这就是问题所在。

Ben: Yeah, over-systematizing or making it symmetrical. You don't even—you don't have to have one-on-ones with the same frequency of all your staff, or some of them you know, you can meet very seldom. Everything is different. Every part of the company is different. You may need to meet with somebody every day.

Ben: 是的，过度系统化或使其对称。你甚至不必——你不需要与所有员工进行一对一会议的频率都相同，或者其中一些你很少见面。一切都不同。公司的每个部分都不同。你可能需要每天与某人见面。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: And then other people, you know, you can meet once a quarter for now because it's just not that serious. And you can't get caught up in making everything fair and symmetric, particularly like your staff. They got to be able to deal.

Ben: 然后其他人，你知道，现在你可以每季度见一次面，因为它没那么重要。你不能纠结于让所有事情都公平和对称，尤其是你的员工。他们必须能够应对。

Ali: Yeah, and this is actually the biggest conversation that I had with Ali early on, is like, if they can't do it, they can't do it. That's it. It's a wrap.

Ali: 是的，这实际上是我早期和阿里最重要的一次谈话，就是如果他们做不到，那就是做不到。就这样。结束了。

Ben: Yeah. Don't try and fix them. They can't be fixed. It's not going to happen.

Ben: 是的。别想去修补他们。他们是无法被修补的。那不会发生。

Ali: And, you know, it's a sad lesson, but important lesson.

Ali: 而且，你知道，这是一个悲伤但重要的教训。

### 与微软的里程碑式合作

Anthony: I actually want to turn the conversation to an area that Ben was saying you had to catch up on, at least in the beginning, which is the BD dealmaking stuff, which is interesting to me just because I think of you as like a consummate dealmaker now. I feel like you're playing chess, everyone else is playing checkers. I want to go back to 2017 with maybe one of the first game-changing deals that you guys did, and that was the deal with Microsoft. Can you guys talk a little bit more about how that deal came about? Anything you do differently? And by the way, founders still to this day ask us about it because it's sort of a model for how they'd like to do deals.

Anthony: 我实际上想把话题转向本（Ben）说你至少在开始时需要追赶的一个领域，那就是业务发展（BD）的交易促成方面，这对我来说很有趣，因为我现在觉得你是个十足的交易高手。我觉得你像在下国际象棋，而其他所有人都在下跳棋。我想回到2017年，谈谈你们做的第一个改变游戏规则的交易之一，那就是与微软的交易。你们能多谈谈那笔交易是如何达成的吗？有没有什么你会做得不同的？顺便说一句，直到今天，创始人仍然会向我们咨询那笔交易，因为它有点像他们希望达成交易的典范。

Ali: Yeah, maybe maybe I should start by saying that, you know, we had tried to get close to Microsoft for a long while. I think Ben had told us, "You need to—that's an important partner because they have the biggest distribution channel." You know, they today they have 60,000 sellers. If you can unlock that in any small way, it's going to be a game-changer for you. And I had been trying—and I had been CEO for a year. So, I'd been trying hard to get in there. And many, many people offered me, "Hey, I actually know Satya, so I'm going to get you introduced." And I got multiple introductions to Satya. He just either never responded or just CCed his EA, and it went into EA, you know, like we're still trying to find time. He's been so busy this last six months. So, but then then he had a meeting with Ben. And I think he was here actually at A16Z. And they actually just talked, and I was not actually in the loop. And then he called me up and said, "Hey, I talked to Satya, and I think this is—he's excited. He wants to do this."

Ali: 是的，也许我应该先说，我们很长一段时间以来都试图与微软建立密切关系。我想本（Ben）告诉我们：“你们需要——那是一个重要的合作伙伴，因为他们拥有最大的分销渠道。”你知道，他们今天有6万名销售人员。如果你能以任何微小的方式打开这个渠道，它都会为你带来颠覆性的改变。我一直都在尝试——我当时已经担任了一年的首席执行官。所以，我一直在努力打入那里。很多人都向我提供帮助：“嘿，我认识萨提亚，所以我会帮你引荐。”我多次被引荐给萨提亚。他要么从不回复，要么就抄送他的行政助理，然后就进了行政助理的邮箱，你知道，就像我们还在努力找时间。他过去六个月一直很忙。所以，但在那之后，他与本（Ben）开了一次会。我想他当时实际上就在A16Z这里。他们实际上只是聊了聊，我当时并不知情。然后他给我打电话说：“嘿，我跟萨提亚谈过了，我认为——他很兴奋。他想做这件事。”

Ben: And I saved the email. So Ben introduced me to Satya, and this was, I think, 3:00 or 4:00 AM. I was in New York, and the email went to Satya. And then Satya added like four or five people to the email thread, and then they added four or five people. So within an hour, I had like 25 emails in my inbox. And suddenly all these people that were not responding to my emails from Microsoft, right after Satya CCed the next person, they were all like, "Hey, I'm clearing my calendar. Would love to meet you. Do you have any time in the next two days or three days?" But really kind of the original pitch of what's the give and get was Ben and Satya at A16Z, and they kind of figured it out, and I was not actually even there. So we had some luck, and then Ali did a couple of things that were—or quite a few things that were very, very effective. So the luck was, at the time, deal with big companies, there's always a timing element. And there was a company called Hortonworks that had a deal with Microsoft to provide some similar kind of functionality. And they were basically putting a gun to Microsoft's head, saying like, "You pay us more money, or we're going to pull our product." And they were on-prem and they were in cloud, so it was like a big mismatch also.

Ben: 我保存了那封邮件。本把我介绍给萨提亚，当时我想是凌晨三四点。我在纽约，邮件发给了萨提亚。然后萨提亚在邮件链中添加了四五个人，然后他们又添加了四五个人。所以在一个小时内，我的收件箱里就有25封邮件。突然之间，所有那些之前不回复我邮件的微软员工，在萨提亚抄送了下一个人之后，他们都说：“嘿，我正在清理我的日程。很想见你。你未来两三天有空吗？”但实际上，最初关于“付出与获得”的提议是本和萨提亚在A16Z达成的，他们基本上搞定了，我当时甚至都不在场。所以我们有些运气，然后阿里做了一些事情——或者说相当多非常非常有效的事情。所以运气就是，当时与大公司打交道，总是有时间因素。当时有一家名为 **Hortonworks**（一家开源软件公司）的公司与微软有合作，提供类似的功能。他们基本上是在威胁微软，说：“你要么给我们更多钱，否则我们就撤回产品。”而且他们是本地部署，而微软在云端，所以也有很大的不匹配。

Anthony: Yeah.

Anthony: 是的。

Ben: So it was a real—so Microsoft was super pissed at them and wanted to stick it to them. And so that was, you know, so you have Satya going like, "I think this company's interesting," and then this ground-level thing going like, "We want to screw these guys." And that kind of opened enough of a door to get it going. But there were so—like one of the most important things in the deal was, which John O'Farrell really emphasized this for both of us, was, "Look, you got to get them to put enough—they're such a big company that they're going to lose interest many times. So, if you don't have them write you such a big check that somebody in there is going to get fired if it doesn't go well, you're—it doesn't matter if you get the deal, you're going to lose the deal." And so, what we did is we're like, and the technique that we had was, "Okay, give us a forecast. We're a little company. We can't afford to do this deal. We can only afford to have one partner. So, give us a forecast of what you'll do."

Ben: 所以微软对他们非常恼火，想给他们点颜色看看。所以，你知道，萨提亚当时的想法是：“我觉得这家公司很有趣”，而基层则在想：“我们要搞垮这些家伙。”这为我们打开了足够的门，让事情得以启动。但其中最重要的一点是，John O'Farrell 对我们两个都强调说：“听着，你必须让他们投入足够的资金——他们是如此大的公司，他们会多次失去兴趣。所以，如果你不让他们给你开一张大支票，大到如果事情进展不顺利，他们中的某个人就会被解雇，那么即使你达成了协议，你也会失去这笔交易。”所以，我们做的，以及我们采用的策略是：“好吧，给我们一个预测。我们是一家小公司。我们负担不起这笔交易。我们只能有一个合作伙伴。所以，给我们一个你们会做什么的预测。”

Ali: Yeah. Because our engineers are busy. They're going to do this integration that wipes out 12 months of our roadmap. We don't—we don't have anything else. You guys have like many thousands of engineers. So this is—we only have one of these we can.

Ali: 是的。因为我们的工程师很忙。他们将进行这次整合，这会占用我们12个月的路线图。我们没有——我们没有其他东西。你们有几千名工程师。所以这是——我们只能有一个这样的。

Ben: Yeah. So we, you know, whoever can sell the—we think you can sell the most, but we don't know, like, what's your—so, you know, like kind of challenged their manhood a little bit. And so they come out with this big ass forecast, and we're like, "Okay, great. Just give us a little portion of that."

Ben: 是的。所以我们，你知道，谁能卖出——我们认为你能卖出最多，但我们不知道，你的——所以，你知道，有点挑战了他们的男子气概。所以他们拿出了这个超大的预测，我们说：“好吧，太棒了。只要给我们一小部分就行了。”

Ali: It was a huge deal. It was a lot of it.

Ali: 那是一笔大买卖。很多。

Ben: Yeah, and then then then Ali said, "Look, when we got all the way down to the deal, he was like, "If I don't get this number, Ben's going to fire me."

Ben: 是的，然后阿里说：“你看，当我们谈到交易的最后阶段时，他说：‘如果我拿不到这个数字，本会解雇我。’”

Anthony: And so, can you help me out?

Anthony: 那么，你能帮我一下吗？

Ben: It was very interesting. Bad cop.

Ben: 这很有趣。一个坏警察。

Ali: It was a very interesting dynamic. So, you know, John O'Farrell had strategized with us and told us that, you know, they have to do a big pre-commit because then they have skin in the game, otherwise they're just going to forget. They'll do like the PR, but then they'll forget about you. But then when we were trying to get that from Microsoft, I remember I was talking to Takeshi Moto, who is, you know, one of the main brains at Microsoft, like one of the key strategists there. And his thing was, "I don't want to give you a big commit because you're such a small company. I'm worried you take this money and you get drunk off of it and you're not going to do anything afterwards." And so I had to really convince him that, "No, I'm extremely hungry. There's no way I will continue to have crazy appetites. Don't worry about it." So both sides were kind of worried about different things. But the give and get was important that you said in the beginning, which was, they had a gap in the product portfolio, right? They were competing with AWS. They had a gap at the time, and we had a great product. They have amazing distribution channel. So in these BD deals, there always has to be a give and get that actually is kind of commensurate. And this is why most of these deals fall apart and they don't work. There has to be something that you as a small player can give that they don't have. And usually you don't have anything to give them. Usually I find all these small companies show up and they come, for instance, to Databricks now, and say, "Oh, we'd love for you to partner with us." But what am I getting out of it, right? You don't report to me. I don't report to you. So the moment we've closed the deal, if it's not good for me, neither of us will just do our side of the bargain. So there has to be something in the deal dynamics, in the construct that inherently is extremely beneficial both sides. There has to be a trade that makes sense. Microsoft really wanted that product. We really wanted their distribution channel.

Ali: 这是一种非常有趣的动态。你知道，约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）曾与我们制定策略，并告诉我们，他们必须做出一个大的预先承诺，因为这样他们才有切身利益，否则他们就会忘记。他们会做公关，但之后就会把你忘掉。但是当我们试图从微软那里获得这个承诺时，我记得我当时正在和武本（Takeshi Moto）交谈，他是微软的主要智囊之一，那里的关键战略家之一。他的想法是：“我不想给你一个大的承诺，因为你是一家如此小的公司。我担心你拿到这笔钱后会得意忘形，之后什么都不做。”所以我不得不努力说服他：“不，我非常渴望成功。我不会停止这种疯狂的胃口。别担心。”所以双方都有些担心不同的事情。但你一开始说的“付出与获得”很重要，那就是他们的产品组合有空白，对吧？他们在和AWS竞争。他们当时有一个空白，而我们有一个很棒的产品。他们有惊人的分销渠道。所以在这些业务发展（BD）交易中，总是必须有一个实际相称的“付出与获得”。这就是为什么大多数这些交易会破裂，无法成功。你作为一个小公司必须能够提供他们没有的东西。而通常你没有什么可以给他们的。通常我发现所有这些小公司都会出现，例如现在他们会来Databricks，说：“哦，我们很乐意与你们合作。”但我们能从中得到什么呢，对吧？你不需要向我汇报，我也不需要向你汇报。所以一旦我们达成交易，如果对我没有好处，我们双方都不会履行自己的那部分协议。所以交易动态中，在结构上，必须有一些东西本身就对双方都极其有利。必须有一个有意义的交易。微软确实想要那个产品。我们确实想要他们的分销渠道。

Ali: And then the other thing that I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't understand is any big deal of that size, you lose at least three times before you win it. And we lost that deal 10 times.

Ali: 然后我认为许多企业家不理解的另一件事是，任何如此规模的大交易，在你赢之前至少会输三次。而我们那笔交易输了10次。

Ben: 10 times. And like including like the day before we were supposed to launch it. The antibodies came out of the company, and Ali had to fly up to Redmond and sit there. There was one engineer that just said, "Not doing this. This is not going to go. We don't." He just—he was, they actually put a guy in place at Microsoft who was actually super—you had a great reputation, but he was a builder. So he just had huge problems with this. It's like, "This is not a product I built. Why would we—why would I make this successful?" So yeah, there's like usually there's like many times. So if you don't have grit, those deals will die because this deal died multiple times as Ben said. It was completely over. It was completely blocked by some exec that said, "Absolutely not. I'm blocking it. It's veto. It's over." And no one wanted to overrule him. So you have to go in there and work. You have to—and the only way we did—I, like, they call it the nerd bird. I would take the SF-Seattle flight up there. I was up there so much. I knew all the buildings, all the rooms, everything. So you just have to spend time on the ground and talk to as many people as possible and sort of influence that organization from within.

Ben: 10次。包括在我们原定发布的前一天。公司内部出现了“抗体”，阿里不得不飞到雷德蒙（Redmond）坐镇。有一个工程师就是说：“不做这个。这不行。我们不。”他就是——他们实际上在微软安排了一个人，他实际上声誉很好，但他是一个构建者。所以他对此有巨大的问题。他会说：“这不是我构建的产品。我们为什么要——我为什么要让它成功？”所以，是的，通常有很多次。所以如果你没有毅力，那些交易就会夭折，因为正如本所说，这笔交易死了好几次。它完全结束了。它完全被某个高管阻止了，他说：“绝对不行。我阻止它。这是否决。结束了。”没有人愿意推翻他。所以你必须进去工作。你必须——我们唯一的方法是——我，他们称之为“书呆子航班”。我会乘坐旧金山到西雅图的航班去那里。我去了太多次。我熟悉所有的建筑、所有的房间，所有的一切。所以你只需要花时间在当地，和尽可能多的人交谈，并从内部影响那个组织。

Ali: And I will say, look, with all the difficulty of the deal, and Microsoft being Microsoft, they've been as good a partner as not only we've had at Databricks, but in the entire portfolio. I mean, they've really lived up and delivered what they said they would do, which is I think you have to give such a huge credit because in the whole Gates and Ballmer era, they were never that good a partner to anybody, and he's really turned that around. And they've been fantastic with us. This was around the time where Satya had taken over, and he was giving to everyone at Microsoft the book Growth Mindset or Mindset, which is about growth mindset. So there was this kind of aura in the air that, "We should—we should try. Let's try to make things happen. Let's have a growth mindset here. Let's see, is there a way we can partner?" So this would have been impossible five years earlier. So kudos to Satya, and they put us on the map, and he's been a great partner ever since. Whenever there's been issues, they always resolve it. So we are very thankful. We wouldn't be where we are without them.

Ali: 我要说的是，尽管这笔交易困难重重，而且微软毕竟是微软，但他们一直是最好的合作伙伴，不仅对Databricks，对整个投资组合来说都是如此。我的意思是，他们真的兑现了承诺，做到了他们所说的一切，我认为你必须给予他们极大的赞扬，因为在盖茨和鲍尔默的整个时代，他们从未对任何人如此友善，而他（萨提亚）真的扭转了局面。他们对我们一直都非常棒。这大约是萨提亚接手的时候，他当时正在向微软的每个人分发《成长型思维》（Growth Mindset）这本书，或者说关于成长型思维的书籍。所以当时空气中弥漫着一种氛围，就是“我们应该——我们应该尝试一下。让我们努力促成事情。让我们在这里拥有成长型思维。让我们看看，有没有办法我们可以合作？”所以这在五年前是不可能的。所以要感谢萨提亚，他们让我们声名鹊起，从那时起他一直是一个很棒的合作伙伴。每当出现问题时，他们总是能解决。所以我们非常感激。没有他们，我们不会有今天的成就。

### 收购策略：以人为本，而非营收

Anthony: Yeah, no, just amazing, amazing, really. I want to open up the conversation to deal more broadly now that you're not a small company anymore and you're a big company making acquisitions, Tabular, Neon, Mosaic, just to name a few. What is your sort of your approach in terms of when to build versus when to buy, slash how do you think about acquisitions more broadly?

Anthony: 是的，不，真是太棒了，真的。我现在想把话题更广泛地转向交易，因为你们不再是一家小公司，而是一家进行收购的大公司，比如 Tabular、Neon、Mosaic，仅举几例。你们在何时自建、何时收购方面，或者更广泛地来说，你们是如何考虑收购的？

Ali: Yeah, I mean, what we try to not do, so let's start with a simple thing, is a lot of companies, especially at scale, they'll buy revenue. So they'll look at a company, they say, "Hey, this company is this size. We'll just buy that company. We'll put more sales people on it. Then we can accelerate the revenue. We're buying that revenue." And that's how they're doing it. We're not doing that. What we're really doing is, number one, we spend a lot of time with the team and the founders. So we're trying to see, "Hey, can we build together? Like, you come here and you build together." That's very different from that buying revenue model. The buying revenue model often times you part ways from the C with the CEO from day one. You can see the big companies, they literally have a plan. I have some execs that come from these big companies, they say, "Hey, our plan usually is to part ways with the CEO. You make a deal, and the CEO can leave." And then but also the key people in those companies quickly leave, all of them, like the top management. And then you keep promoting the people from below that couldn't get promoted before. And then eventually you bring in your own people to take over the company, and then the company is dead. There's nothing left of it, and there's no integration between that asset that you bought and the platform that you have. So to avoid all of those, can you get people that really feel like they're your co-founders? So, we spent just enormous amount of time with who we're like the—the company you're buying, who are the founders, how do they work, are we culturally the same? Spend time with them. Do we get along? Do we see the world the same way? Are we going to click? Are we going to do this together? Are we going to be able to build in the next five years? So, that's where we spend number one. Number two, we spend a lot of time on the product. What's the product experience? How would we integrate this? What would it look like? How much can we—can we rewrite most of it? Can we not rewrite it? What's the—what programming? Like, I always ask this, and people like, "Why? That's such a dumb question. I ask what language would you write it in? Like, why do you want to do that? What is—what does that matter?" No, because we're going to integrate the code bases, right? It's like the build systems won't work. It's not going to even compile. So a product is something we spend a huge amount of time and talking to customers, understanding what the excitement around that product looks like, and how the integration would look like. The last thing we do is we look at the financials. What's the revenue multiple? And how much can we grow it? And what's the three-year plan, five-year plan, and so on? And I feel like big companies' corporate departments do it exactly in the reverse order of this. They start with, "Hey, the revenue is this, but we could accelerate it, and the multiple is so low." And like, you know, "In this, in my Excel sheet here, this makes perfect sense." And then second, they go to like, "Hey, is this a good product?" And then lastly, like, "Hey, how do we convince these knuckleheads? I mean, we probably don't want to have them here, but we got to pay them off somehow." So I think, you know, thinking about it that way, you get more longevity out of it.

Ali: 是的，我的意思是，我们尽量不做的事情，让我们从一个简单的事情开始，就是很多公司，尤其是在规模上，他们会购买营收。所以他们会看一家公司，说：“嘿，这家公司有这么大。我们直接买下这家公司。我们会增加更多的销售人员。然后我们就可以加速营收。我们正在购买这份营收。”他们就是这样做的。我们不是那样做的。我们真正做的是，第一，我们花大量时间与团队和创始人在一起。所以我们试图看看：“嘿，我们能一起构建吗？比如，你来这里，我们一起构建。”这与那种购买营收的模式非常不同。购买营收的模式通常是你从第一天起就与首席执行官分道扬镳。你可以看到大公司，他们真的有一个计划。我有一些来自这些大公司的高管，他们说：“嘿，我们的计划通常是与首席执行官分道扬镳。你达成交易，首席执行官就可以离开。”但那些公司的关键人物也很快就会离开，他们所有人，比如高层管理人员。然后你不断提拔那些以前无法获得晋升的下层人员。然后最终你引入自己的人来接管公司，然后公司就死了。什么都不剩了，你购买的资产和你拥有的平台之间也没有整合。所以为了避免所有这些，你能否找到那些真正觉得自己是你的联合创始人的人？所以，我们花了大量时间与我们正在收购的公司，他们的创始人，他们如何工作，我们的文化是否相同？花时间与他们在一起。我们相处融洽吗？我们看待世界的方式是否相同？我们能产生共鸣吗？我们会一起做这件事吗？我们能在未来五年内构建吗？所以，这是我们投入的第一点。第二点，我们花大量时间在产品上。产品体验是什么？我们如何整合它？它会是什么样子？我们能重写大部分代码吗？我们不能重写吗？编程语言是什么？我总是问这个问题，人们会说：“为什么？那是个多么愚蠢的问题。我问你会用什么语言来编写它？比如，你为什么要这样做？那有什么关系？”不，因为我们要整合代码库，对吧？就像构建系统不会工作一样。它甚至不会编译。所以产品是我们花费大量时间与客户交谈、了解该产品周围的兴奋点是什么样子以及整合会是什么样子的事情。我们做的最后一件事是查看财务状况。营收倍数是多少？我们能增长多少？三年计划、五年计划等等是什么？我觉得大公司的企业部门正好是按相反的顺序做的。他们从“嘿，营收是这么多，但我们可以加速它，而且倍数很低。”然后，你知道，“在我的Excel表格里，这完全说得通。”然后第二步，他们会说：“嘿，这是一个好产品吗？”然后最后，他们会说：“嘿，我们如何说服这些笨蛋？我的意思是，我们可能不想让他们留在这里，但我们必须以某种方式付钱给他们。”所以我认为，你知道，那样思考，你会从中获得更长的寿命。

Ben: Yeah. And this really comes—it sounds like he's talking like a product guy, but this is really the thing that people get wrong on the go-to-market. Because what happens is if you've got multiple product architectures, that's going to mean multiple sales engineer forces, multiple post-sales things, and your entire sales efficiency is going to go through the floor. And because, you know, they have a keen eye on that, everything they buy ends up looking like a Databricks product. And that work is going in. They're not just selling some crap to get some money to go on a corp dev thing. And I would say so many—when you bring in a professional CEO, this is what they screw up because they don't understand that.

Ben: 是的。这听起来他像是在谈论产品，但这实际上是人们在市场推广方面做错的事情。因为如果你的产品架构多样化，那将意味着多支销售工程师团队，多个售后服务环节，你的整个销售效率将直线下降。而且因为，你知道，他们对此有敏锐的洞察力，他们购买的一切最终都看起来像 Databricks 的产品。而且那项工作正在进行中。他们不仅仅是为了公司发展而卖一些垃圾来赚钱。我想说，很多——当你引入一位专业的首席执行官时，他们会把这一点搞砸，因为他们不理解这一点。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: Engineering goes, "Yeah, yeah, we can take it on. There's another set of engineers. We don't care if they work on that." Blah, blah, blah. And engineering gets less efficient too, but it wrecks the field. And then the customers hate it because, "Yeah, like, okay, I've got to learn another access control model. I got to do this. I got, you know, these are not things anybody wants to be part of."

Ben: 工程部门会说：“是的，是的，我们可以接手。还有另一批工程师。他们做什么我们不在乎。”等等等等。工程效率也会降低，但它会破坏整个领域。然后客户会讨厌它，因为“是的，好吧，我必须学习另一种访问控制模型。我必须做这个。我必须，你知道，这些都不是任何人想参与的事情。”

Ali: Yeah, 100%. This is—it's the go-to-market side that you're worried about, that that experience that those customers will have. They're going to come back immediately and say, "Hey, we were already upset about these things before the acquisition. Maybe you can fix them now." It's like, "No, actually, you know, several of those people actually quit, and now we're going to just work on integration, and that thing now got pushed out another two years." So you don't want to be in that situation. So there's a lot of companies that do that, and by the way, what they're doing works revenue-wise. They are getting the revenue. They are getting the—the stock swap works. If they're multiple of the—

Ali: 是的，百分之百。你担心的是市场推广方面，是那些客户将拥有的体验。他们会立刻回来抱怨：“嘿，在收购之前，我们已经对这些事情很不满了。也许你们现在可以解决它们。”但实际上，你知道，那些人中有好几个已经辞职了，现在我们只专注于整合，那件事又被推迟了两年。所以你不想处于那种境地。有很多公司这样做，顺便说一句，他们正在做的事情在营收方面是有效的。他们确实获得了营收。他们确实获得了——股票互换是有效的。如果它们是多倍的——

Ben: It's a creative deal temporarily.

Ben: 这暂时是一笔创造性的交易。

Ali: Yeah, it works, and then the first year you get the bump in the revenue. You get a second year boost in revenue growth as well. So the financial engineering actually works great for those companies. It's just long-term, it ends up being like a bag of crap that doesn't work together.

Ali: 是的，它有效，然后第一年你会看到营收增长。第二年营收增长也会有提升。所以财务工程对这些公司来说效果很好。只是从长远来看，它最终会变成一堆无法协同工作的垃圾。

Ben: And it affects a brand. One of the reasons Databricks is so powerful is all their customers want to buy all their products because they're like, "We know that's the best software we buy." And as soon as you start chipping away at that with these financial strategies, you can't get it back because the reputation is every customer's experience. There's no marketing through that.

Ben: 而且它会影响品牌。Databricks之所以如此强大，原因之一是他们所有的客户都想购买他们所有的产品，因为他们会说：“我们知道那是我们购买的最好的软件。”一旦你用这些财务策略来侵蚀这一点，你就无法挽回，因为声誉就是每个客户的体验。这方面没有任何营销作用。

Ali: It's the best software because it was written by the engineers and built by those that were the best.

Ali: 它是最好的软件，因为它是由工程师编写，并由最优秀的人构建的。

Ben: Including the acquisitions that we got. They were phenomenal people that came in, and they continue, and since we gelled, they continued building it. So that's why it's great. It's like, you know, so we pay a lot of attention. That's like back to the, you know, who are you getting into your company?

Ben: 包括我们所做的收购。那些加入的人都非常出色，他们继续，而且自从我们融合之后，他们继续构建。所以这就是它很棒的原因。这就像，你知道，所以我们非常关注。这又回到了，你知道，你把谁招进公司？

Anthony: Yeah, that's the other thing, right? You can buy something that's got a lot of sales where you're downgrading your whole company. Ross Perot actually wrote about in Citizen Perot his biggest fear, which definitely came true, was he built this elite thing at EDS, and then they would actually acquire IT departments, and he was like, "They're going to absorb us, not vice versa." And that does happen.

Anthony: 是的，这是另一回事，对吧？你可以收购一个销售额很高的公司，但你实际上是在降低你整个公司的水平。罗斯·佩罗（Ross Perot）在《公民佩罗》中写到他最大的恐惧，而这确实发生了，那就是他在 **EDS**（Electronic Data Systems: 一家信息技术服务公司）建立了这个精英团队，然后他们会实际收购IT部门，他当时想：“他们会吸收我们，而不是反过来。”这种情况确实会发生。

Ali: Yeah, there is one really good company that—well, one really successful company that we never acquired, and I always vetoed it whenever it came up because I just think that the quality of their employee base is not great, and I didn't want it to dilute Databricks. Otherwise, from every other angle, that deal always made sense, and I always vetoed it because I felt that, you know, they're all going to quit or be super unhappy. Let's just not do it.

Ali: 是的，有一家非常好的公司——嗯，一家非常成功的公司，我们从未收购过，而且每当它被提出来时，我总是否决它，因为我只是觉得他们员工队伍的素质不太好，我不想它稀释Databricks的价值。否则，从其他所有角度来看，那笔交易总是很有意义的，而我总是否决它，因为我觉得，你知道，他们都会辞职或者非常不开心。我们还是别做了。

Ben: It's also why merger of equals are because—

Ben: 这也是为什么平等合并会失败的原因——

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: Because the cultures aren't equal. The people aren't equal.

Ben: 因为文化不平等。人不平等。

Anthony: And what made you feel that way? You just spent time with them and they just didn't exude sort of Databricks culture?

Anthony: 是什么让你有那种感觉的？你只是和他们相处过，他们没有散发出那种Databricks的文化气息吗？

Ali: Well, I mean, it's—look, it's like with everything else. It's like when we were grading students at the university, it's like, "Okay, the rock stars are super easy to find out." So they're like there. And then the people that are really, really bad, that's like, it's not hard. And then there are people in the middle, that's it's—that's in the gray zone. This was a company that was, you know, I feel like the talent is not phenomenal, and you don't need to be a genius to know that. And then there's some startups, you know, immediately like, "Okay, these guys are Olympia winners, and they're like phenomenal, and they're like executing like crazy, and they have a track record." So I don't think those are that hard, and we try to hire these. And this is the one that I vetoed. The hard part is what do you do with the ones in the middle?

Ali: 嗯，我的意思是，你看，这就像其他所有事情一样。就像我们在大学里给学生打分时，你会说：“好吧，那些‘摇滚明星’很容易就能发现。”他们就在那里。然后那些非常非常糟糕的人，也一眼就能看出来，不难。然后还有一些人介于中间，那是在灰色地带。这是一家，你知道，我觉得人才并不出众的公司，你不需要是天才也能知道这一点。然后有些初创公司，你知道，立刻就会觉得：“好吧，这些人是奥运冠军，他们表现非凡，执行力超强，而且有业绩记录。”所以我认为那些并不难，我们努力招聘这些人。而我否决的就是那些。难点在于，你如何处理那些处于中间的人？

Ben: That's always where you spend all of your energy trying to suss out like, "You know, okay, they're not stellar, stellar, but maybe they are. Maybe they just didn't have the go-to-market. They didn't have the funding. They didn't have the support that they needed and so on. Maybe they could if we give them a chance," or "Maybe they're just mediocre." And that's where you spend a lot of your time. But you got to spend time with them. You have to interview all the people. You have to have your people interview all the people. Can't just be this can't be an Excel sheet exercise.

Ben: 那总是你花费所有精力去弄清楚的地方，比如：“你知道，好吧，他们不是顶尖的，但也许他们是。也许他们只是没有市场推广。他们没有资金。他们没有所需的支持等等。也许如果我们给他们一个机会，他们就能做到，”或者“也许他们只是平庸。”那才是你花费大量时间的地方。但你必须花时间与他们相处。你必须面试所有的人。你必须让你的员工面试所有的人。这不能只是一项Excel表格练习。

Ali: Yeah. And Silicon Valley has a lot of lopsided companies. You'll have a great engineering team and a bad company because it's like, you know, bad leadership, bad go-to-market. You also can have like guys who can sell anything with a ridiculously poor engineering team, and they can just sell it. And you got to be very, very careful about that. Actually, our CRO at Databricks is, you know, he came from a company that he can sell anything.

Ali: 是的。硅谷有很多不平衡的公司。你可能会有一个很棒的工程团队，但公司却很糟糕，因为，你知道，领导力差，市场推广也不行。你也可以有一些人，他们能卖任何东西，即使工程团队糟糕得离谱，他们也能卖出去。你必须非常非常小心这一点。实际上，我们Databricks的**首席营收官**（CRO: Chief Revenue Officer）他来自一家什么都能卖的公司。

Ben: Yeah, he was selling SFTP, secure FTP, which is free, and he was selling it for a while. He was selling it for a lot. He was making a lot of money. We're saying, "You know, the electronic medical health records, how important are they? If they got dropped, how much of a risk is it to your business?" "Well, this is secure FTP. You need it to be secure on somebody grabbing that file." He's good.

Ben: 是的，他当时在卖 **SFTP**（Secure File Transfer Protocol: 安全文件传输协议），这是免费的，但他卖了一段时间。他卖得很贵。他赚了很多钱。我们说：“你知道，电子病历有多重要？如果它们丢失了，对你的业务有多大风险？”“嗯，这是安全文件传输协议。你需要确保在有人获取那个文件时它是安全的。”他很擅长。

Anthony: Yeah. The only thing I'd add too is this strategy is probably making you more attractive to the people you want to acquire, too. They don't want to sell if they're going to get fired right away.

Anthony: 是的。我唯一要补充的是，这种策略可能也会让你们对那些你们想要收购的人更具吸引力。如果他们会立刻被解雇，他们就不想出售。

Ali: Yeah, for sure. It's very competitive.

Ali: 是的，当然。竞争非常激烈。

Ben: Yeah, 100%. I mean, you know, there's also a reputation, right? People know. They'll look back and say, "Okay, what happened to your previous acquisitions?"

Ben: 是的，百分之百。我的意思是，你知道，也有声誉问题，对吧？人们知道。他们会回顾并说：“好吧，你之前的收购怎么样了？”

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: You know, was there a huge fight and everybody's quitting left and right, or did they work out? How are you taking care of those people? What roles do they have? Do they have influential roles in your company? That's also important. So, you're setting a precedent. You're setting a precedent in many, many ways with acquisitions, M&A, deal dynamics, the price, when you go through the lawyers come back and that you're spending all those 20, 30 days doing the definitive agreement. Every little thing you agree to there is a precedent for the next deal.

Ben: 你知道，是不是发生了巨大的争吵，每个人都纷纷辞职，还是他们成功了？你如何照顾这些人？他们担任什么角色？他们在公司中是否有影响力？这也很重要。所以，你正在树立一个先例。你在收购、并购、交易动态、价格、当你通过律师回来并花费20、30天制定最终协议时，在很多很多方面都在树立一个先例。你在那里同意的每一个小细节都是下一次交易的先例。

Ali: Yep. Totally.

Ali: 是的。完全正确。

### Ben Horowitz 的激励邮件

Anthony: Now, maybe actually just to turn so we're talking about Databricks as an acquirer. If we go back in time again to maybe a moment where you thought about selling, and maybe that you didn't actually seriously consider that, but I wanted to actually just sort of quote this infamous email sort of circulating our firm that Ben sent to—

Anthony: 那么，也许我们现在可以把话题转回到Databricks作为收购方。如果我们再次回到过去，也许是某个你考虑出售的时刻，也许你并没有真正认真考虑过，但我实际上想引用本（Ben）发给我们公司内部流传的一封臭名昭著的邮件——

Ali: Yeah, Ali brought it. I had forgotten about it. You brought it up at a board meeting.

Ali: 是的，阿里提到了。我当时忘了。你在董事会议上提到了它。

Anthony: Brought it to the bed. But and actually this wasn't and this was not pertaining to selling the company, but it was I think selling a candidate, right? And you talk about, "Hey, Ben, can you sell this candidate on the fact that we'll be worth $10 billion?" Maybe the candidate was worried about the company getting—

Anthony: 把它带到了董事会。但这实际上与出售公司无关，我想是关于说服一位候选人，对吧？你谈到：“嘿，本，你能说服这位候选人，让他相信我们公司将价值100亿美元吗？”也许这位候选人担心公司会被——

Ali: He wanted he wanted to have a double trigger because the company if Databricks sells, am I—and they fire me as a salesperson, what equity am I going to get? So give me double trigger so I'm protected if we get bought and I get fired, I vest all my equity immediately.

Ali: 他想要一个双重触发机制，因为如果Databricks被出售，如果他们解雇我这个销售人员，我能得到多少股权？所以给我双重触发，这样如果公司被收购，我被解雇，我的所有股权就能立即归属，我就能受到保护。

Anthony: Yep. Exactly. And so, you know, in response to this, Ben, and I'm going to paraphrase this a little bit, but he writes back to you, I'm like thinking about Ben's tone in this, "You are severely underselling the opportunity. We are Oracle in the cloud, and we will be worth 10x what Oracle is." But what was your reaction when you when you saw that? And did that give you more fortitude to not sell the company?

Anthony: 是的。没错。所以，你知道，本（Ben）回复了你，我会稍微转述一下，但他在信中写道——我当时在想本的语气——“你严重低估了这个机会。我们是云端的甲骨文，我们的价值将是甲骨文的10倍。”但当你看到这些时，你的反应是什么？这是否给了你更大的勇气，让你没有出售公司？

Ali: Yeah, Ben's crazy. I think the first thought was exactly, "Ben's crazy." But no, I think both Ben and Mark always kind of pushed us to think bigger. I remember we did the pitch at A16Z for, I think, our Series D, which would have been around 2017 or so. And the question was asked, "What's your biggest bottleneck?" And I said, "Biggest bottleneck is hiring." He said, "Okay, well, who are you losing to?" And I said, "Well, it's Google, it's the FANGs." And the response I got back was, "Well, you need to just add the Databricks to FANG. It needs to be FANGDB with a straight face." And it was like, and I was like, and my reaction was I laughed. I literally said, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is not serious." It's like, "Yeah, that's the problem." It's like, "Huh?" It's like, "No, I'm serious. You need to add Databricks to FANG." And then there was like a pause, and there was like this, "And I think it's doable." And so then I actually went back and thought about it a lot, and I was like, "Is it doable? Am I the crazy one, or are they the crazy one? Who's the crazy one here? Who's nuts here?" And that kind of pushed us to think about how do we change our compensation philosophy? How do we, if we wanted to go and get the best of the best out of Google? What does it require? And we developed a new model, but we're like, "Okay, actually, the way to think about it is your market cap divided by number of employees. That's how much money you can give away in terms of dilution." And actually we did calculated the number at that time, and we're like, "Wait, we're actually richer than Google in terms of, you know, how much dilution we can afford per engineer," because they were at that time—this was like, you know, before the Twitter downsizing. So all the companies were oversized. So we did the calculations. It turned out that we actually can probably pay **P95th percentile** (95th百分位：指在同行业中，薪酬水平高于95%的公司). We did the math on P95th percentile for engineering, and it was like, "Yeah, this actually the math works out. We moved all the comp bands, and we told them, and we told the employees about it." It's like, "Okay, we're paying you P95th. And we can afford it." So was that came out of that simple, you know, so these simple, you know, "Your trillion dollars, just add your acronym to the to FANG," and so on. They're silly, and they're kind of crazy, but they do push you. And you go back and think about, "Hey, what is the fundamental reason from first principles that we couldn't do something like that? Why couldn't we be a trillion? What's the bottleneck from being a trillion or being part of Fang?" And then you think about it, and you start zooming in on, "Can we unblock that?" So it has helped us and has been a driving force even though it's, you know, it's a little annoying. It's like, "You know, hey, mom, dad, I got the A+. It's like, 'Yeah, but we ranked—I was number two in the class. So was someone better than you?'"

Ali: 是的，本很疯狂。我想第一个想法就是，“本很疯狂。”但不是，我认为本和马克总是鼓励我们思考更大的格局。我记得我们在A16Z进行了一次演示，我想是我们的D轮融资，大约在2017年左右。当时被问到：“你们最大的瓶颈是什么？”我说：“最大的瓶颈是招聘。”他说：“好的，那么你们输给了谁？”我说：“嗯，是谷歌，是那些**FANG**（Facebook、Amazon、Netflix、Google）公司。”我得到的回复是：“嗯，你们需要把Databricks加入到FANG中。必须是FANGDB，而且要一本正经地说。”当时我笑了起来。我真的说：“是的，是的。我的意思是，这不严肃。”就像是：“是的，这就是问题。”他又说：“嗯？”就像是：“不，我是认真的。你需要把Databricks加入到FANG。”然后停顿了一下，然后他说：“而且我认为这是可以实现的。”所以后来我回去认真思考了很久，我想：“这真的可行吗？是我疯了，还是他们疯了？到底谁疯了？谁在这里发疯了？”那种想法促使我们思考如何改变我们的薪酬理念？如果我们想从谷歌那里挖到最优秀的人才，需要什么？我们开发了一个新模型，但我们想：“好的，实际上，思考这个问题的方式是你的市值除以员工人数。这就是你在股权稀释方面可以付出的金钱。”实际上我们当时计算了这个数字，我们想：“等等，我们在每个工程师可以承受的稀释程度方面，实际上比谷歌还要富有，”因为他们当时——这就像，你知道，在推特裁员之前。所以所有公司都人员过剩。所以我们进行了计算。结果表明我们实际上可能可以支付P95th百分位。我们计算了工程人员P95th百分位的薪酬，结果是：“是的，这个数学确实可行。我们调整了所有的薪酬区间，并告诉了他们，也告诉了员工。”就像是：“好的，我们给你P95th的薪酬。而且我们负担得起。”所以这来自于那个简单的，你知道，所以这些简单的，你知道，“你们万亿美元，只要把你们的首字母缩写加入FANG，”等等。它们很傻，有点疯狂，但它们确实会推动你。你回去思考：“嘿，从第一性原理来看，我们为什么不能做那样的事情？为什么我们不能成为万亿公司？成为万亿公司或成为FANG的一部分的瓶颈是什么？”然后你思考它，你开始深入研究：“我们能解除那个瓶颈吗？”所以它帮助了我们，并且一直是一个推动力，尽管它，你知道，有点烦人。就像是：“你知道，嘿，爸爸妈妈，我得了A+。”就像是：“是的，但我们排名——我班上第二。那有人比你更好吗？”

Anthony: Yeah.

Anthony: 是的。

Ben: For what it's worth, when I joined the firm in 2019, the Series F of Databricks was the first deal I worked on, and I think the valuation was $6 billion. Ben says to us, "Oh, well, it's going to be a hundred billion dollar company." And we were like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, Ben." Lo and behold, they're doing all this work. I'm like, "What are you doing?" Like, six billion, seven billion, doesn't matter.

Ben: 顺便说一句，2019年我加入公司时，Databricks的F轮融资是我经手的第一个项目，当时估值大概是60亿美元。本（Ben）对我们说：“哦，它会成为一家千亿美元的公司。”我们当时想：“是是是，本，你说得对。”结果呢，他们做了所有这些工作。我当时想：“你们在干什么？”就像，60亿，70亿，都没关系。

Ali: I was right.

Ali: 我是对的。

Anthony: He was right. Yeah. That one you have proven to be right. Still have ways to go for two trillion. But, well, the thing that you almost never get, and Ali and I had this conversation the one time we did have a real acquisition offer on the company, is you just don't get this good a market opportunity with this good an entrepreneur like that. That's the rarest of rare things. We see great entrepreneurs, but their market opportunity is limited. And then we see companies that have a great market opportunity, but the entrepreneur is not big enough to fulfill that. But this was a case where we have both.

Anthony: 他是对的。是的。那件事你证明了你是对的。离两万亿还有很长的路要走。但是，嗯，你几乎从未得到的东西，阿里和我有过一次这样的对话，那是我们确实收到了一份真正的收购要约的时候，那就是你很难遇到这么好的市场机会，同时又拥有这么优秀的创业者。这是极其罕见的事情。我们看到过优秀的创业者，但他们的市场机会有限。然后我们也看到过拥有巨大市场机会的公司，但创业者却不足以实现这一目标。但Databricks就是这样一个两全其美的案例。

### 拒绝收购：坚持与信念

Ali: Yeah, I remember actually the conversation that kind of flipped me. The acquisition offer was on the table. It was six times bigger than the valuation we had at the time. And I had done the mistake of telling my co-founders. And yeah, they were like, "Let's go."

Ali: 是的，我记得那次真正改变我想法的对话。当时收购要约摆在桌面上。它的估值是我们当时估值的六倍。我犯了个错误，告诉了我的联合创始人。是的，他们当时都说：“我们走吧。”

Anthony: They were like, "We're done."

Anthony: 他们当时说：“我们完蛋了。”

Ali: So, everyone's like, "Stop the work. Stop working. Take your hands off the keyboard. Nobody work anymore. We're done here." Right? And let's count my money. Like, you know, how much money do I have? What would you buy for that amount of money? So they were like completely not doing anything. And there's just this crazy gossip going around. And then it was like they had told some of the exec, and then they were calling each other every day like, "Hey, what all he think? You think he's—he looked in a bad mood today. You think he's going to say no?" It's like, "What did he say? He said this thing. He said this once." So there's just a lot of politicking going around, and nobody was doing any work anymore. And I was like, "You know, maybe they're right. Maybe we should just sell." And I remember having that conversation with Ben, and I think we were in a car, both of us. And you know, he says that he drops the F-bombs and he pisses people off and so on, and they don't take the feedback. But actually he did exactly the radical candor thing with me, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. I'll support you either case. And actually, if you sell for this number, it's really great for me, me being Ben. Like, we make a lot of money at A16Z. I'll pay the investors back many times over. So honestly, if it's for me personally, that's probably the better option. But I'm just thinking back, I was CEO LoudCloud Opsware, and just the cards I were given that that company wasn't the company you have. And when I look back, how often do you in life get a chance to even have a company like LoudCloud or Opsware, let alone a Databricks? And this is just such a freaking big market. You can sell, you're going to make a lot of money, and you'll be super successful in life. But if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking you missed that one shot. That was the one thing. I should have taken it all the way. And now I'll never know how far I could have taken it." Could have been. "So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less. I really couldn't care less." And I was like, "Okay, thanks. Hang up. We're never doing this. We're done. This is not happening."

Ali: 是的，我记得那次真正改变我想法的对话。当时收购要约摆在桌面上。它的估值是我们当时估值的六倍。我犯了个错误，告诉了我的联合创始人。是的，他们当时都说：“我们走吧。”所有人都说：“停止工作。停止工作。把手从键盘上拿开。没人再工作了。我们到此为止了。”对吧？然后开始数我的钱。你知道，我有多少钱？你会用这么多钱买什么？所以他们完全什么都不做。然后就是各种疯狂的八卦传开。然后他们又告诉了一些高管，然后他们每天互相打电话说：“嘿，他怎么想？你觉得他今天心情不好。你觉得他会拒绝吗？”就像是：“他说了什么？他说了这句话。他只说了一次。”所以当时有很多政治斗争，没有人再工作了。我当时想：“你知道，也许他们是对的。也许我们应该直接卖掉公司。”我记得和本（Ben）有过那次对话，我想我们都在车里。你知道，他说他会爆粗口，他会惹恼别人等等，他们不接受反馈。但他实际上对我做了完全坦率的事情，他说：“嘿，你想做什么都行。无论哪种情况我都会支持你。而且实际上，如果你以这个数字出售，对我来说真的很好，我是本。比如，我们在A16Z赚了很多钱。我会多次回报投资者。所以老实说，如果是我个人，那可能是更好的选择。但我只是回想，我曾是LoudCloud和Opsware的首席执行官，而我当时所处的公司，并不是你现在拥有的公司。当我回首往事，你一生中有多少机会能拥有像LoudCloud或Opsware这样的公司，更不用说Databricks了？而且这是一个如此巨大的市场。你可以出售，你会赚很多钱，一生都会非常成功。但如果你像我一样，你余生都会回想，错过了那一次机会。那是唯一一件我应该坚持到底的事。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。”他问：“你想带着那种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有金钱？你想做什么，我都会支持。我真的无所谓。我真的无所谓。”我当时想：“好的，谢谢。挂断电话。我们永远不会这样做。我们结束了。这不会发生。”

Anthony: What a pep talk.

Anthony: 多么鼓舞人心的一次谈话。

Ali: Yeah. So that's how we did it. So it was excellent.

Ali: 是的。我们就是这样做的。所以非常棒。

Ben: I think I also said, "I guarantee you you'll never have an idea this good again as long as you live."

Ben: 我想我还说了一句：“我向你保证，你这辈子再也不会有这么好的主意了。”

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: This is the best idea you're ever going to have.

Ben: 这是你这辈子能想到的最好的主意。

Ali: Yeah. Well, an idea that also takes off and works, right?

Ali: 是的。嗯，一个也能成功并奏效的想法，对吧？

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

### AI时代的人才战争与薪酬策略

Anthony: So I want to tie one thing that you said in all of that is you were company building. But then also just sort of the calculus that founders but also your employees are making, and that's around comp. So in the early days you could afford to pay P95th percentile, right? Today there's crazy AI talent wars going on. We've talked about this a bunch throughout the summer. And we know that you can bring the best talent in the house to Databricks. How do you keep them with all of this craziness going on? Because now P95th percentile, I don't even know what that means. Is that like you pay a billion dollars?

Anthony: 所以我想把你在所有这些话中提到的一点联系起来，那就是你在创建公司。但同时，创始人以及你的员工都在进行一种计算，那就是关于薪酬。所以在早期，你们能够支付P95th百分位的薪酬，对吧？今天，人工智能人才战正打得如火如荼。我们整个夏天都在讨论这个问题。我们知道你们能把最优秀的人才带到Databricks。在当前这种疯狂的情况下，你们如何留住他们？因为现在P95th百分位，我甚至不知道那意味着什么。那是不是意味着你们要支付10亿美元？

Ali: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. The joke is which company says, "We're P50th?" You know, "We pay P50th." Like, who does that? There's no company that does that. So, how does—how does—

Ali: 是的。完全正确。完全正确。是的。笑话是哪家公司会说：“我们是P50th？”你知道，“我们支付P50th。”谁会那样做？没有公司会那样做。那么，怎么——怎么——

Ben: There is. Yeah. The 75th percentile is the single biggest lie in Silicon Valley. It's like a complete fabrication, probably. So, but I think that the—it is a crazy time with AI, and I do think I feel bad. I did actually an exit interview with someone this morning. I feel bad for the kids right now because there's like too much pressure on them. Like they feel like, "Oh, they have to start companies, and they have to—" And I've never actually had anything like this because every year I talk to the interns, and I get questions about, "How do we build our own company? How do we succeed at Databricks?" And so on. The last two years have just been crazy. All the kids are like, "When should I become a CEO? When should I start my own company? What's a good valuation? Am I missing out if I do like an internship here for three months at Databricks? Will I have wasted my opportunity in life? And this is like the time for **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence: 通用人工智能), and I could have like been one of the guys that does super intelligence." And like, "How would you time that? How was it for you? How old were you when you were 22? What did you do?" And so I do think it's kind of crazy times, and I do think it's also exaggerated. I don't think anyone's getting hundred million dollar offers. I mean, yes, there's like one Character AI and so on, but I don't think it's actually true. And it's also in the interest of CEOs, you should know, to say that, "Hey, people try to poach data people from Databricks for a billion dollars, and they said no." It's in our interest to say that, right? Because that kind of sets the bar at a billion, and then any employee that cannot for half of it's going to feel really insulted. It's like, "Why don't I get a billion dollar offer? I heard on the news that the other people are getting a billion." So I do think that the most—by the way, Sam used that in reverse on Meta. He's like, "Oh, yeah, they offered all our guys hundred million dollars into the next guy who got the 50."

Ben: 有的。是的。75th百分位是硅谷最大的谎言。这可能完全是捏造的。但是，我认为——现在是人工智能的疯狂时代，我确实感到难过。我今天早上确实和某人进行了一次离职面谈。我为现在的孩子们感到难过，因为他们身上有太多的压力。他们觉得，“哦，他们必须创业，他们必须——”我以前从未遇到过这种情况，因为每年我都会和实习生交谈，我会被问到：“我们如何建立自己的公司？我们如何在Databricks取得成功？”等等。过去两年简直是疯了。所有的孩子都问：“我什么时候应该成为首席执行官？我什么时候应该创办自己的公司？一个好的估值是多少？如果我在Databricks实习三个月，我会错过机会吗？我会浪费我的人生机会吗？现在是通用人工智能（AGI）的时代，我本可以成为那些做超级智能的人之一。”他们还会问：“你会如何把握时机？对你来说是怎样的？你22岁的时候多大？你做了什么？”所以，我确实认为这是一个疯狂的时代，而且我认为它也被夸大了。我不认为任何人都能拿到亿万美元的报价。我的意思是，是的，比如有一个Character AI等等，但我不认为这实际上是真的。而且，你应该知道，首席执行官们也有兴趣说：“嘿，有人试图以十亿美元从Databricks挖走数据人才，但他们拒绝了。”我们有兴趣这么说，对吧？因为这把门槛设定在十亿美元，然后任何拿不到一半的员工都会感到非常受侮辱。他们会想：“为什么我没有拿到十亿美元的报价？我听说新闻上说其他人拿到了十亿美元。”所以，我确实认为最——顺便说一句，Sam在Meta上反向利用了这一点。他会说：“哦，是的，他们给我们的所有人都开了一亿美元的报价，然后下一个拿到五千万的人。”

Ali: Now I have to pay 100 at least. Right. That's like the smart move. But I would say that, look, and not all startups have the valuation of their—we're 100 billion, and with 10,000 employees, we actually can afford to actually pay significant and we do pay significant for the right talent. But what do you do when you're smaller? Like we were smaller at some point. Well, then it's talk about how big you are going to get and what the opportunity is and what you could do together and what it would worth together. But I think most people earlier in the career, they really want to learn, and they want to really feel that they can have impact. So if you can really bring them in, and you can sort of mentor them, you can stay close to them, and as a CEO, you have huge power if you can just spend two minutes with a kid out of school. It's immense to them, and you say, "Hey, I'll even mentor you. I'll help you. What do you want to do in five years? I'm thinking about starting my own company actually in six months." You know, "But I'll work at Databricks for 10 years, but in six months, I would love to be a CEO." So then you can say, "Hey, I can coach you to—I know how the fundraising. I know the early days," and so on. And you can actually mentor a lot of them, and that's actually worth a lot to them as well. But in general, like help them be successful and help them build their careers. And also, if you've done it before, like we have, you can kind of calm them down a little bit and say, "Hey, you have like few decades. Don't worry about it." It's like, it's not the **FOMO** (Fear of Missing Out: 错失恐惧症), and the pressure has to be kind of reduced. And I think that's also calming. They feel good about it.

Ali: 现在我至少得付100万。对。那才是聪明的做法。但我想说的是，你看，并不是所有初创公司都有他们的估值——我们是千亿公司，拥有1万名员工，我们实际上能够支付高额薪酬，而且我们确实为合适的人才支付高额薪酬。但当你规模较小时该怎么办？就像我们曾经规模较小的时候。那么，就谈谈你将来会发展到多大，机会是什么，你们可以一起做什么，以及它在一起会值多少钱。但我认为大多数职业生涯早期的人，他们真的想学习，他们真的想感受到自己能够产生影响。所以如果你能真正把他们带进来，你能指导他们，你能和他们保持密切联系，作为首席执行官，如果你能花两分钟和刚毕业的孩子聊聊，你就有巨大的影响力。这对他们来说是巨大的，你会说：“嘿，我甚至会指导你。我会帮助你。你五年后想做什么？我实际上正在考虑六个月后创办自己的公司。”你知道，“但我会在Databricks工作十年，但在六个月后，我很想成为一名首席执行官。”那么你就可以说：“嘿，我可以指导你——我知道如何融资。我知道早期阶段，”等等。而且你实际上可以指导他们很多人，这对他们来说也很有价值。但总的来说，就是帮助他们成功，帮助他们建立职业生涯。而且，如果你以前做过，就像我们一样，你可以稍微安抚他们一下，说：“嘿，你还有几十年的时间。别担心。”就像，这不是错失恐惧症（FOMO），而且压力必须得到缓解。我认为这也能让他们平静下来。他们会对此感觉良好。

Ben: Yeah. I always say the best cure for starting your own company fever is to start your own company, and that'll teach you.

Ben: 是的。我总是说，治疗创业狂热最好的方法就是自己去创业，那会给你上一课。

Ali: It's not that easy. By the way, they come back after start companies. Often times they come back to Databricks, and they're much more thankful, and you understand. And actually, I didn't mention this earlier when you asked about acquisitions. My favorite acquisition, because I said they start with the people, right? And then the product. And with the people, I love to hire people who have seen great at a big company like—or I don't know if it's great, but they've seen process scale big company. They've been at a Google. They've been at Amazon. They understand the processes so that I understand how to navigate a bureaucracy and work with it, and they're not going to just be inundated by it. But then they've gone on and done their own startup. And that's really, really hard. It's extremely hard trying to do everything yourself, and you don't have any help. And you know, you're trying to do this in this crazy market, and you're trying to compete with hundred million dollar offers when you have like nothing. So that takes a certain amount of grit, and it's really humbling. So I love the people that have done both of those. They end up being actually the perfect employees at Databricks because they come in and they're really thankful. They're like, "Hey, what these guys have done at Databricks is actually really, really hard. I tried it, and I'm really good. I was like one of the best at Google or somewhere, and then I did my own startup, and we absolutely failed. And so, hey, show some respect here. These guys know what they're talking about." So those are great employees actually. So, you know, I think keep a great relationship with people who leave your company because they'll—they can boomerang back in a couple years.

Ali: 没那么容易。顺便说一句，他们创业后会回来。很多时候他们会回到Databricks，他们会更加感激，你也会理解。实际上，你之前问我收购时我没提到这一点。我最喜欢的收购，因为我说他们从人开始，对吧？然后是产品。对于人，我喜欢招聘那些在大公司见过大世面的人——或者我不知道是不是大世面，但他们见过大规模公司的流程。他们曾在谷歌工作过。他们曾在亚马逊工作过。他们了解这些流程，这样我就知道如何驾驭官僚体系并与之合作，他们不会被它淹没。但随后他们又自己创业了。那真的非常非常难。自己做所有事情极其困难，而且你没有任何帮助。而且，你知道，你在这个疯狂的市场中努力做这件事，当你一无所有的时候，你却要和亿万美元的报价竞争。所以那需要一定的毅力，而且非常令人谦卑。所以我喜欢那些两者都做过的人。他们最终实际上成为了Databricks最完美的员工，因为他们进来后会非常感激。他们会说：“嘿，这些人在Databricks所做的事情实际上非常非常困难。我尝试过，而且我真的很优秀。我曾是谷歌或其他地方最优秀的人之一，然后我创办了自己的公司，我们彻底失败了。所以，嘿，请在这里表示一些尊重。这些人知道他们在说什么。”所以那些实际上是很棒的员工。所以，你知道，我认为要和离开公司的人保持良好的关系，因为他们——他们几年后可能会回心转意。

Ben: Yeah. And look, it's very hard to make these things work. And it also requires a lot of luck. I mean, I think one of the things people don't realize is a lot of things have to go right that should never go right. And a lot of things will go wrong, but if you can grab your lucky moments, that's a rare—that's a rare thing.

Ben: 是的。而且你看，要让这些事情奏效非常困难。它也需要很多运气。我的意思是，我认为人们没有意识到的一件事是，很多本不该顺利的事情必须顺利进行。而且很多事情都会出错，但如果你能抓住你的幸运时刻，那是一种罕见的——那是一种罕见的事情。

### 创业时机与运气

Ali: Yeah. One way to prove that is if Databricks started in 2013. If we had started in 2012, that rocky year, that difficult year 2015 would have then happened in 2014, right? To start the funds, are we not—we don't have the revenue. But we were a cloud AI open source company. Those things didn't take off in 2014. So, even if like, if we had to do the CEO change and all of that, and I had become CEO a year earlier, it just we were too early in the market. The cloud hadn't taken off. AI was not—nobody—that was not even a phrase. AI meant robotics. People use machine learning as the phrase. And so company would have failed. We wouldn't have had enough momentum. There's not enough cloud, you know, **TAM** (Total Addressable Market: 潜在市场总量) there to be had. If we started the company in 2014, a year later instead, so a year later than we actually did, then we would have had our difficult year in 2016. But by 2016, the cloud was starting to happen. AI was starting to happen. So we would have done the fixes in 2017, and it would have been too late to—late to the party, and probably the hyperscalers would have taken it away. Our competitors were taking it away, and we were just wouldn't have get enough momentum to be able to succeed. And that's timing of when we started. So, how did we clock it so well? We had to wait for Mate to finish his PhD thesis. That's it.

Ali: 是的。证明这一点的一种方法是，如果Databricks在2013年成立。如果我们早在2012年就成立，那么2015年那个艰难的年份，那个动荡的年份，就会在2014年发生，对吧？要启动资金，我们没有——我们没有收入。但我们是一家云端人工智能开源公司。那些东西在2014年并没有起飞。所以，即使我们必须进行首席执行官的更换等等，而且我提前一年成为首席执行官，但我们当时在市场上出现得太早了。云计算还没有兴起。人工智能甚至不是一个词。人工智能当时意味着机器人技术。人们用机器学习来指代。所以公司就会失败。我们不会有足够的势头。当时没有足够的云端潜在市场总量（TAM）。如果我们晚一年，也就是在2014年成立公司，那么我们就会在2016年经历艰难的一年。但到了2016年，云计算开始发展，人工智能也开始兴起。所以我们会在2017年进行修补，但那时就太晚了——赶不上潮流了，可能超大规模云服务商会抢走市场。我们的竞争对手会抢走市场，我们根本无法获得足够的势头来成功。这就是我们创业的时机。那么，我们是如何把握得如此之好的呢？我们不得不等 Mate 完成他的博士论文。就是这样。

Anthony: Yeah, that that, you know, that that was the whole thing.

Anthony: 是的，那，你知道，那就是全部。

Ali: So, there's a lot of randomness. And you got to get lucky. And it was so on the edge as it was that on the Series C, Ion had a handshake with the Redpoint, with Redpoint, and Redpoint just stopped returning his calls to the point where the Series C was led by us, who also led the Series A, and NEA, who led the Series B. We co-led the Series C because nobody else would do it. I mean, it was that—it was that close to going under, and most companies weren't even right that would be it.

Ali: 所以，有很多随机性。你必须走运。当时情况非常危急，C轮融资时，Ion与Redpoint达成了口头协议，但Redpoint后来就不再回复他的电话了，以至于C轮融资最终由我们（也曾主导A轮融资）和 NEA（主导B轮融资）共同领投，因为没有其他人愿意投资。我的意思是，当时公司离倒闭就差那么一点点，大多数公司根本就不会走到那一步。

Anthony: Yeah, it was very close because we couldn't get funding for anyone. It's just funding freezed up, and nobody wanted to invest anymore. So it was really a lifeline from A&Z.

Anthony: 是的，当时非常接近，因为我们无法从任何人那里获得资金。融资冻结了，没有人再愿意投资。所以A&Z的这笔投资真的是救命稻草。

Ali: Yeah, we were just burning a lot of cash. We weren't generating much revenue other than Spark Summit.

Ali: 是的，我们当时只是在烧钱。除了Spark Summit，我们没有产生多少收入。

Ben: We had a lot of downloads. We had a lot of downloads.

Ben: 我们有很多下载量。我们有很多下载量。

Ali: A lot of downloads and recurring conference revenue.

Ali: 大量的下载和持续的会议收入。

Ben: Yeah, and recurring.

Ben: 是的，而且是持续的。

Anthony: How confident were you in that time when things were at their level?

Anthony: 当事情处于那种状态时，你当时有多大的信心？

Ali: Oh, I mean, I seriously considered taking the professor job at Berkeley because I seriously thought this was going to be very, very hard to pull off. I think the sentiment at Databricks was, or at least my sentiment was, "Look, you win some things, you lose some things in life. We created Apache Spark, and we made it a worldwide sensation. Everybody's downloading. The downloads are through the roof. We have this greatest conference. Thousands of people come to our conference. It's awesome. Let's go back. Let's do it again. Let's publish another paper and do those kind of things. We're just not business guys. We just don't understand business. That's okay. We don't want to be business guys." So that's kind of how I felt about it, right? But what I knew was that, hey, by the way, every mate went back and became a professor. All this stuff happened.

Ali: 哦，我的意思是，我认真考虑过接受伯克利大学的教授职位，因为我真的觉得这会非常非常难成功。我认为Databricks当时的情绪，或者至少我的情绪是：“看，人生有得有失。我们创造了Apache Spark，并让它风靡全球。所有人都在下载。下载量飙升。我们有这个最棒的会议。成千上万的人来参加我们的会议。太棒了。让我们回去吧。让我们再做一次。让我们再发表一篇论文，做那些事情。我们只是不懂商业的人。我们就是不懂商业。没关系。我们不想成为商业人士。”所以当时我就是这么想的，对吧？但我知道的是，嘿，顺便说一句，每个伙伴都回去当教授了。所有这些事情都发生了。

Ben: Yeah. Yan went back.

Ben: 是的。Yan回去了。

Ali: But, you know, in 2015, we knew that we had tried everything. And by the way, PLG is something that we had tried very hard, and it didn't work for us. Actually, one of our biggest failures was PLG at Databricks. Everybody kept telling us, "PLG, PLG, PLG." And we're like, "Okay, product growth," and Amazon didn't just swipe their credit cards. We don't need sales people. But so in 2015, I had kind of like—

Ali: 但是，你知道，在2015年，我们知道我们已经尝试了所有方法。顺便说一句，**PLG**（Product-Led Growth: 以产品为核心驱动增长的策略）是我们曾非常努力尝试过的东西，但它对我们来说并不奏效。实际上，我们在Databricks最大的失败之一就是PLG。每个人都一直告诉我们，“PLG，PLG，PLG。”我们当时想，“好吧，产品增长，”而亚马逊并没有只是刷他们的信用卡。我们不需要销售人员。所以，在2015年，我有点像——

Ben: Except Cranny.

Ben: 除了克拉尼。

Ali: Exactly. Yes, that is true. Kudos to Mark. So that year we had like formed some hypothesis that we have nothing to lose. What if we just pivoted these things? What if we went all in into B2B enterprise sales? Because certainly it's not—PLG is not working. At $3 million AR, that's not going to take you anywhere. And they're just taking our open source software, so we have to have proprietary code around it. And yeah, the execs team are all PhDs. So what if we bring in someone that doesn't have a PhD and see how it goes? So, so—

Ali: 完全正确。是的，这是真的。向马克致敬。所以那一年我们形成了一些假设，认为我们没有什么可失去的。如果我们只是转变这些东西呢？如果我们全力投入到B2B企业销售中呢？因为显然——PLG不起作用。300万美元的**年度经常性收入**（AR: Annual Revenue）不会带你去任何地方。他们只是拿走我们的开源软件，所以我们必须围绕它拥有专有代码。是的，高管团队都是博士。那么，如果我们引进一个没有博士学位的人，看看会怎么样呢？所以，所以——

Ben: I never forget Arcelon going, "We made the number." And I was like, "You made a ridiculous number. You made the number. If you keep making that number, you're going to go bankrupt. You didn't make the number. You made a number that you set that was way too low. We haven't figured it out."

Ben: 我永远不会忘记 Arcelon 说：“我们达到了目标。”我当时想：“你达到了一个荒谬的数字。你达到了目标。如果你继续达到那个数字，你就会破产。你没有达到目标。你设定的数字太低了。我们还没有弄清楚。”

Ali: Ben was very nice and complimentary in our board meetings that year, 2015. We were in a bit of trouble.

Ali: 2015年那一年，本在我们的董事会议上非常友善和赞扬。我们当时确实遇到了一些麻烦。

Ben: Let's say it was very truthful.

Ben: 让我们说，那非常真实。

Ali: But yeah, so we had nothing to lose. So we didn't know that we were going to succeed, but we had nothing to lose to make those big changes, and we made them in 2016. And it turned out those were the bottlenecks. Giving away your software for free. Not having execs that have seen the movie before like Ron, who came in. And just the PLG motion is not going to cut it. So maybe we should just try. We weren't certain that B2B would work, but we knew that PLG is not working for sure.

Ali: 但是的，所以我们没有什么可失去的。所以我们不知道我们会成功，但我们没有什么可失去的，可以做出那些重大改变，我们在2016年做出了这些改变。结果发现那些就是瓶颈。免费提供你的软件。没有像罗恩（Ron）这样有经验的高管，他加入了进来。而且PLG模式行不通。所以也许我们应该尝试一下。我们不确定B2B是否会奏效，但我们知道PLG肯定行不通。

### 关键人才与团队凝聚力

Ben: Yeah, well, another like, I mean, you know, we got Ron. I mean, like the fact that the first sales guy we hired was a sales savant, like a genius. Shock. I mean, like that never happens. And he was a guy we didn't know. Our talent team found him from some company we never heard of.

Ben: 是的，嗯，另一个，我的意思是，你知道，我们得到了罗恩。我的意思是，我们雇佣的第一个销售人员是一个销售天才，一个奇才。令人震惊。我的意思是，那种事从没发生过。而且他是一个我们不认识的人。我们的招聘团队在一家我们从未听说过的公司找到了他。

Ali: Yeah, French company. And the only really the only reason we hired him was because he was the only guy Cranny ever liked. In all the sales guys he ever interviewed, he was like, "This is the guy."

Ali: 是的，一家法国公司。我们雇佣他的唯一真正原因是因为他是克拉尼唯一喜欢的人。在他面试过的所有销售人员中，他都说：“就是这个人。”

Anthony: Wow.

Anthony: 哇。

Ali: And yeah, he is a new generation more—but we just like stumbled into him.

Ali: 是的，他是新一代的——但我们只是偶然遇到了他。

Ben: Yeah. Like unbelievable. And without Ron, very hard to see us this company getting to where it got to. So there's some luck involved in us even finding him. But then that he was phenomenal, and also kudos to Yan, who actually led the search in 2015. But yeah, Ron was game-changing for us. But Ron was a very uncomfortable hire because he did not have a PhD.

Ben: 是的。简直难以置信。没有罗恩，很难想象我们公司能走到今天。所以我们能找到他也有一些运气成分。但他非常出色，也要感谢 Yan，他实际上在2015年领导了这次招聘。但是的，罗恩对我们来说是改变游戏规则的人物。但罗恩是一个非常令人不安的招聘，因为他没有博士学位。

Ali: And he did have an engineering degree. Yeah, he does have an engineering degree from Stanford. That helped a little bit, but he's he's a sales, you know, true and true sales guy. He's not one of these—he's a classic sales person, right? Who grew up in sales, even though he has an engineering degree. So the comfortable thing would have been to pick someone, and we had some candidates in the mix who were super technical, using the product, giving us feedback, but they probably would not—and that would have been much more comfortable for us.

Ali: 他确实有工程学学位。是的，他确实拥有斯坦福大学的工程学学位。这多少有点帮助，但他是一个地地道道的销售人员。他不是那种——他是一个经典的销售人员，对吧？虽然他有工程学学位，但他是在销售行业成长起来的。所以，更稳妥的做法是选择那些超级技术型的人，我们当时也有一些这样的候选人，他们使用产品，给我们反馈，但他们可能不会——那样对我们来说会舒服得多。

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: Yeah, Ron was uncomfortable. He was a very uncomfortable hirer, and he made it very uncomfortable for us for many years, and he still does.

Ali: 是的，罗恩让人不舒服。他是一个非常让人不舒服的招聘者，他在很多年里都让我们感到非常不舒服，现在依然如此。

Ben: But that's a lot of the key to the company.

Ben: 但那是公司成功的关键之一。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: It forces—it forces a customer focus that would be impossible to have without somebody that smart and crafty about getting his way. I mean, just like unbelievable.

Ben: 它强迫——它强迫公司以客户为中心，如果没有一个如此聪明、狡猾地达到目的的人，这是不可能实现的。我的意思是，简直难以置信。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: If you can keep also the original team together, that's important. We were, you know, seven co-founders still. Many of the co-founders like, you know, you said data warehousing was a big push for us. My co-founder Reynold was really the one that kind of pushed this.

Ali: 如果你也能保持最初的团队在一起，那很重要。我们仍然是七位联合创始人。很多联合创始人，你知道，你说数据仓库对我们来说是一个很大的推动力。我的联合创始人雷诺德（Reynold）实际上是推动这件事的人。

Ben: Yeah, like, well, the contribution level from a large number of co-founders is unique in the industry. I mean, you've got Patrick, you have Rainald, you have Mate, you have Arcelon. I mean, it's crazy how much the original team contributes.

Ben: 是的，我的意思是，大量联合创始人的贡献水平在行业中是独一无二的。我的意思是，你有帕特里克（Patrick），你有雷纳德（Rainald），你有马特（Mate），你有阿塞隆（Arcelon）。我的意思是，最初的团队贡献了如此之多，这太疯狂了。

Ali: Yeah. So the PhDs all contribute like Arcelon really made the go-to-market work. And he really made the sort of Ron work with the rest of the company. That was super critical. Mate continued doing lots of innovations over the years. Patrick led all of engineering in big chunks of it. And so on. And we've had other people. We've been lucky to get such folks. So hiring is critical and keeping the original talent. I think those were some of the things.

Ali: 是的。所以所有博士都做出了贡献，比如阿塞隆（Arcelon）真正让市场推广奏效了。他真正让罗恩（Ron）与公司其他部门合作。那至关重要。马特（Mate）多年来持续进行大量创新。帕特里克（Patrick）领导了工程部门的很大一部分。等等。我们还有其他人。我们很幸运能得到这样的人。所以招聘和留住原始人才至关重要。我认为这些是其中的一些事情。

Ben: Yeah, usually founders—usually only one of the co-founders contributes long-term. And so to have, you know, to have that going and Yan's still on the board and Scott's still on the board. I mean, it's very unusual.

Ben: 是的，通常创始人——通常只有一个联合创始人会长期做出贡献。所以，你知道，能有这种情况，而且 Yan 仍在董事会，Scott 仍在董事会。我的意思是，这非常不寻常。

Anthony: Yeah, we have a lot more we can get into, but we're at time, so we'll leave it for future episodes of Boss Talk, but this is a great first episode.

Anthony: 是的，我们还有很多可以深入探讨的，但时间到了，所以我们把这些留到未来的“老板访谈”节目中吧，但这真是很棒的第一集。

Ali: All right, that was fun. Thanks so much.

Ali: 好的，很有趣。非常感谢。

Anthony: Thank you so much, guys.

Anthony: 非常感谢你们，各位。
