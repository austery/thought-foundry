### 疯狂的财报周与市场新高

大家早上好，欢迎回到市场开盘直播。今天是10月31日，星期五，祝大家万圣节快乐。我没有打扮，因为这周是今年最疯狂的一周之一，我几乎都没怎么出门。每天都有七到九小时的直播，我实在没有精力准备服装，非常抱歉。这周太狂野了。我想，你可以把我称作一个在财报周后筋疲力尽的股市YouTube博主。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Friday, October 31st. Happy Halloween to everybody. I did not dress up because this week has been one of the most wild weeks this year. I have barely went outside this week. So, nine-hour streams basically eight, seven to eight hour streams every day outside of the nine hour stream. I mean, I just I don't have an outfit. I'm sorry. This was a wild week. I guess you can call me a stock market YouTuber who is absolutely exhausted after a week of earnings.</p>
</details>

但这一切都是值得的，因为标普500指数正处于历史最高点。我们还要谈谈亚马逊，它的财报简直是摧枯拉朽。亚马逊现在的股价是252.65美元。我想我今天的装扮就是“因亚马逊而富有”吧，估计我们很多人都是这个装扮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's worth it given S&P 500 right here is at alltime highs. And we've got Amazon, which we'll talk about that absolutely demolished earnings. Amazon right here, 252.65. I guess I dressed up as rich on Amazon today. That's I guess you can say a lot of us dressed up with that.</p>
</details>

是的，我们正在直播市场开盘。感谢大家的到来。希望大家这周过得愉快。这周真是漫长的一周，发生了太多事情。这周也同样激动人心，我们正进入2025年的最后冲刺阶段。所以，我们需要这样美好的一周。我们需要大型科技公司的财报表现良好，需要美联储降息。归根结底，这都是真金白银。我知道我们整天看着数字和K线图上下波动，但最终，这些股票每涨跌一美元，都会在某种程度上影响我们和我们的家庭。所以，我们需要一个好周，而看起来我们确实度过了相对不错的一周，希望这个周五我们能强势收官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we're live and we're here for the market open. Thank you everybody for being here. I hope everyone has been having a good week. It's been a long week, dude. It's been a long freaking week. There's just been so much going on and again this has been an exciting week, but we're getting into the home stretch of 2025. So this is one of those weeks that we really needed to have as a good week. And we needed big tech earnings to be good. We needed the Fed to cut. We you know all of us this is real money at the end of the day. I know we all look at numbers and candlesticks go up and down, but at the end of the day, every dollar of these stocks up or down does affect all of us in some way and affect our families. So, we needed a good week and it looks like we got a relatively good week and hopefully we can end out the week pretty strong on this Friday.</p>
</details>

即使昨天标普指数下跌了1%，我甚至不知道为什么，我认为那次回调没有任何实质性的原因，但今天我们在盘前市场基本上又涨回来了1%。我们失去的阵地几乎都收复了，这很可能是因为亚马逊和苹果发布了惊人的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even yesterday when we had that 1% decline on the S&P, which I don't even know why. I don't think there's any meaningful reason for why we had that draw down. We're back basically up 1% in the pre-markets. Everything that we lost, we are pretty much getting back. And it's likely because Amazon and Apple just had monster earnings.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头财报概览

顺便说一下，苹果股价达到了276美元，一度触及284美元。他们的财报非常出色，简直是碾压级别的。我们稍后会讨论。Reddit上涨了10%，亚马逊显然上涨了13%，这是非常非常重要的一天。Meta也从650美元的低点开始有所回升。我认为Palantir开盘后会尝试冲击200美元，这将是很好的景象。英伟达回到了200美元以上，特斯拉446美元，Robin Hood 141美元。比特币和以太坊也开始有所复苏，比特币在109,600美元，昨天曾跌至105,000美元；以太坊曾跌至3,700美元，现在回到3,850美元。我知道它们最近表现滞后，比特币需要上涨约7,000美元才能让十月份收绿。但无论如何，盘前市场出现了一些回升势头，这是非常好的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apple, by the way, 276. At one point, it hit 284. So, they had an they had a great earnings, then they crushed it. We'll talk about that. Reddit, it's up 10%. Amazon obviously 13%. Massive, massive day. They crushed it. Meta starting to recover a little bit from the lows at 650. Palantir, I think it's going to try to push 200 when the market opens, which will be great to see. Nvidia back above 200. Tesla 446. Robin Hood 141. Bitcoin and Ethereum starting to get a little bit more recovery. Bitcoin at 109.6. It fell to 105 yesterday. Ethereum fell to 3,700 back at 3850. I know they've been lagging. And Bitcoin's got to have like a $7,000 candle to end green for October. Um, but regardless, you do have a little bit of momentum coming back in the pre-market, which is very nice to see as we get into it.</p>
</details>

下周也将是疯狂的一周。周一有Palantir，这是一个重头戏。周一还有Grab。然后周三好像是Hood。所以下周将是极其重要的一周。本周对股市至关重要，下周则对我的投资组合至关重要，对许多持有这些股票的人也同样重要。我们已经完成了标普500公司中40%的财报发布。所以，这是我们必须度过的一周。虽然漫长，但我们挺过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next week's also going to be crazy. Monday, we've got Palantir. That's a big one. We also have Grab on Monday. So, you know, and then we have Hood I think on Wednesday. So, it's just going to be a massive massive week next week. This was really important for the stock market next week is really important for my portfolio. Also really important for a lot of people that are long those names. And we are pretty much done with 40% of big tech earnings or of the S&P 500 earnings. And so, this was one of those weeks we had to get through. And it was a long week, but we got through it and we are here.</p>
</details>

### 亚马逊财报详解：AWS王者归来

好了，让我们开始吧。谢谢大家的到来。我们先从亚马逊开始。今天必须先谈亚马逊。我们有很多宏观方面的话题要讨论，但亚马逊是今天的重头戏。让我们来看看发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. Let's get into it. Let's start off with Amazon. We got to start off with Amazon. We got a bunch of different macro stuff to talk about, but Amazon is the big one today. And let's cover what happened.</p>
</details>

首先，恭喜所有持有亚马逊股票的人。我想我们在频道上公开讨论亚马逊大约是在一个月前，也就是九月初。它引起我兴趣的原因是，尽管纳斯达克指数年初至今上涨了近20%，标普500指数上涨了11%，但亚马逊的股价却是负的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, congratulations to everyone in Amazon. I think on the channel publicly, we started really talking about Amazon basically a month ago. Call it early September. And the reason for that, it kind of just piqued my interest. It was that the stock was negative year-to- date, although the NASDAQ was up almost 20%, the S&P 500 was up 11%.</p>
</details>

这是我在九月中旬发布的帖子。当时我认为它下跌的两个原因是：关税可能影响其电商业务，以及**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊网络服务，亚马逊旗下的云计算平台）业务不够令人兴奋。而我的投资逻辑很简单，当时有很多评论和互动都认为，它不应该以这样的水平交易。当时股价是222美元，我就是在那时建仓的。后来它跌到了212美元。我想我们都达成了共识：这是地球上最重要的公司之一，它应该被这样对待吗？从技术上讲，是的，如果他们无法从AWS获得增长，就理应如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so this was the post I made. Yeah. Towards the middle of September, as you can see right here, and the two reasons I thought it was going down, tariffs might affect their commerce business, AWS not as exciting. And the thesis simply was, and there was a lot of comments and engagement under these posts that just like it doesn't deserve to be trading at these levels. And this was at 222. That's when I initiated the position. It ends up going down to 212. And I think all of us kind of came together and said, "This is one of the most important companies on the planet. Do they deserve to be treated the way they're being treated?" And it's technically yeah, they do if they can't get the growth from AWS.</p>
</details>

那么，Jassy昨天交出了什么答卷呢？他带来了AWS的增长。这改变了一切。有时候事情就是这么简单，华尔街只需要一件事来改变看法，一旦你满足了华尔街的需求，一切都会改变。线上商店同比增长10%，第三方卖家服务同比增长12%，而亚马逊网络服务（AWS）增长了20%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what did Jassy deliver yesterday? He delivered the growth on AWS. And that is kind of what changed anything. I mean, sometimes it's really simple. Sometimes it's one thing that the street needs for a change. And once you give what the street needs, everything changes. Online stores up 10% year-over-year. Third party seller services up 12% year-over-year. Amazon web services 20%.</p>
</details>

这才是重头戏。实体店增长7%，订阅服务增长11%，广告业务增长24%，季度营收达到了180亿美元的运行率，这简直不可思议。我们对广告业务的讨论不够多，但这是一个高利润业务，亚马逊在这方面持续表现出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the big one. Physical stores 7%, subscriptions 11%, and then advertising 24% at an $18 billion uh quarterly run rate, which is just incredible. I mean, we don't talk enough about the advertising business, but high margin business and Amazon continues to crush it.</p>
</details>

Jassy说了什么？他说：“自2022年以来，我们从未见过如此强劲的AWS增长。”就是这句话。他一说完，一切都尘埃落定了。我不知道亚马逊能否维持目前14%的涨幅，但我确实认为股价很难再回到220美元。我认为它在盘前市场能保持这种势头而没有回落的原因是，当Jassy说：“各位，我们已经近三年没有见过这种增长了”，华尔街会格外关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what did Jassy say? He said, "We haven't seen this type of AWS growth since 2022." That's it. As soon as he said that, it was over. And I don't know if Amazon's going to hold the 14% move right now. I I definitely think it's going to be harder to go back to 220. Uh but I I do think that the reason it's actually maintaining this momentum in the pre-market and it's not getting faded away is because when Jassy says, "Guys, we have not seen this type of growth in almost three years. The street pays attention."</p>
</details>

华尔街最关心的是什么？他们关心我们一直在讨论的唯一一件事，那就是AWS的加速增长。顺便说一下，他们公布的增长率是20.2%，而所谓的**Whisper number**（耳语数字: 指华尔街分析师私下流传但未公开的非官方盈利预测，通常比官方预期更受市场关注）是18.9%。所以他们超过了耳语数字。当你超过那个数字时，你就赢了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what does the street care about the most? They care about the one thing we've been talking about, which is AWS acceleration. The whisper number, by the way, they came in at 20.2%. The whisper number was 18.9%. So, they beat the whisper number. The whisper number is like the the number that Wall Street is literally whispering about, but like is not the actual number they're expecting. When you beat that number, you win. When you beat that number, you win. And it's really hard to lose.</p>
</details>

Jassy在电话会议上说：“第四季度将再增加1吉瓦的电力容量，并预计到2027年将负载能力翻倍。电力仍然是Trainium需求的主要行业瓶颈。我们的定制Trainium 2芯片已全部被预订，其性价比优于竞争对手30%到40%。”他们基本上是在亚马逊内部打造一个迷你版的英伟达，而其估值只有英伟达的一半。当然，他们的增长不如英伟达，但关键在于，你得到的是一个年初至今几乎没有上涨的公司。现在，它上涨了约14%。它的护城河是真正无法否认的，而且它是那种能够长期存在的公司之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jassy on the call said, "Another 1 gigawatt coming in Q4 and expect to double load capacity by 2027. Power remains the main industry bottleneck on the Trainium demand. Our custom Trainium 2 chips are fully subscribed with 30 to 40% better price performance than competitors. They're basically building a little bit of a mini Nvidia inside of Amazon, trading at half the valuation of Nvidia. Obviously, they don't have as much growth as Nvidia, but the point is you're you're getting something that barely is up here to date. Now, it's up around 14%. Uh, and the moat is a moat that truly just can't be denied, and it is one of those companies that's going to be around for a long time.</p>
</details>

需求在大型和中型客户中依然强劲。Trainium 3将在今年晚些时候预展，预计2026年初实现全面量产。我的意思是，这是一家不会消失的公司。从长远来看，在250美元的价位上，它可能成为投资组合的基石。它很可能仍然很便宜。也许我今天不会在它大涨之后追高，但如果你准备长期持有，这家公司将会一直存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Demand remains strong across large and midsize customers. Trainium 3 will preview later this year with full volumes expected in early 2026. I mean again, this was one of those companies that's like it's not going anywhere. It could become a cornerstone of the portfolio at 250 over the long term. It likely is still cheap, right? May I probably wouldn't chase it today after the run that it's having. But nonetheless, if you're ready to hold on to this for a long time, then this company's going to be here for a long time.</p>
</details>

关于**Capex**（Capital Expenditures: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金），他们今年将支出1250亿美元，高于预期的约1180亿美元。对于2026财年，他们预计支出将超过1250亿美元。所以资本支出是有保障的，这对半导体公司，特别是英伟达来说是好事。我想这就是英伟达现在上涨的原因。他们没有分红或股票回购，所以他们可以只对业务进行再投资，因为他们不必回报外部股东。华尔街也因此奖励他们，因为他们实现了增长。如果你不给我们分红或回购，那就给我们增长。Jassy做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Capex, they're going to be spending 125 billion this year. So that's up from the expectations of around 118 billion. And then for fiscal year 2026, they are projecting to spend more than 125 billion. So you've got the capex taken care of, which is uh really good for the semiconductor names, especially Nvidia. I think that's why Nvidia is up right now. They're not giving you a dividend or a share buyback. So they don't have to reinvest into the business or they can only reinvest into the business because they don't have to reward external shareholders. And the street's rewarding them for that because they got the growth. Like if you're not going to give us a dividend or share buyback, give us the growth. Jassy deliver the growth.</p>
</details>

第三，他们的营业利润率从11.8%下降到9.4%，但据我了解，这主要是由于裁员和一次性遣散费。所以想象一下，营业利润率仍然在12%。如果他们在未来五年内将其提高到接近15-20%，那么你谈论的是一家营业收入可能达到2000亿美元的公司。而那样的公司估值可能会接近4到5万亿美元，基本上是现在的两倍。所以，说“我要长期持有亚马逊股票”并不可怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then number three, their operating margins were down from 11.8% to 9.4%, but from my understanding, this was more so because of the layoffs and one-time severance charges. So imagine operating margins are still at 12%. Again, if they increase that closer to 15 20% over the next five years, you're talking about a company that's likely going to be doing 200 billion in operating income. And that is a company that probably gets closer to the $4-5 trillion valuation, which is basically a double from here. And so it's not that scary to say, "Hey, I'm going to hold on to Amazon stock for a long time."</p>
</details>

诚然，营业收入同比持平，自由现金流的增长方式也不及谷歌和微软。顺便说一下，他们之所以能在**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，衡量公司盈利能力的重要指标）上超出预期30%，是因为他们确认了对Anthropic的投资收益。他们对Anthropic的投资获得了94亿美元的收益，还有另一家他们投资的初创公司，这让他们在EPS上超出了预期。但坦率地说，即使他们错过了EPS，我也不认为股价会涨15%，但也不认为会跌15%。原因在于，唯一真正重要的故事是AWS。这确实是华尔街唯一想看到的东西。华尔街得到了它，而且得到的是一个远超预期的数字，这让你知道AI工作负载的需求是强劲的，而亚马逊正在满足这种需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, operating income was flat year-over-year. That is true. And free cash flow is not growing the way Google and Microsoft is growing. The the one reason they beat on EPS, by the way, they beat by 30% is because they recognized their investment from Anthropic. So again, they have a $9.4 billion investment in Anthropic and that has been or $9.4 billion gain from Anthropic and another startup they invested in and that allowed them to beat on EPS. But quite frankly, even if they missed on EPS, I don't know if the stock would be up 15%, but I don't think it would be down 15%. And the reason for that is because the only story that really mattered was AWS. This is literally the only thing the street wanted to see. And the fact that the street got it and they got it at a number that was way above expectations, that lets you know the demand for AI workloads is strong and Amazon is is fulfilling that demand.</p>
</details>

### 苹果业绩稳健，指引超预期

接下来是苹果。苹果也表现出色。关于苹果最重要的一点，也是我没想到的，是他们提高了第四季度的指引。该指引最终被提高到10%至12%的收入增长。如果我没记错的话，苹果已经有近两年没有实现10%至12%的收入增长了。他们一直徘徊在3%到4%。因此，我们能看到这样的收入增长非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Apple. So let's talk Apple. Apple crushed it as well. So, the big thing about Apple that crushed it, which I really didn't expect, is that they increased their guidance for Q4. And that guidance ended up getting increased to 10 to 12% revenue growth. Apple has not done 10 to 12% revenue growth in almost two years if I'm not wrong. They've always been at 3 to 4%. And so, as a result, you know, we we just haven't seen that type of revenue growth. And the fact that we got it was very exciting.</p>
</details>

Tim Cook基本上表示，他对iPhone 17非常兴奋，对他们在中国看到的势头感到兴奋，尽管他们本季度在中国的业绩未达预期。iPhone的销量也略有下降，但总的来说，他对其长期存在的整体AI机遇感到非常兴奋。结果，华尔街对此非常买账。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Tim Cook basically said he's really excited for iPhone 17. He's really excited for the momentum they're seeing in China, even though they missed on China this quarter. iPhone also missed. It was a very slight miss, but nonetheless, it missed. And he's also very excited for the overall AI opportunity that exists long term. And as a result, the street ate it up. I mean, the street absolutely ate it up.</p>
</details>

在我看来，对于他们所展现的增长乏力而言，这家公司的估值相当高，但他们也拥有1320亿美元的现金。他们一直在回购自己的股票。归根结底，就其消费设备的 distribución 而言，这可能不是一家很快就会消失的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a company that's trading at a pretty aggressive multiple in my opinion for the lack of growth that they're putting up, but they also have 132 billion in cash. They are consistently buying back their stock. And at the end of the day, this is probably not a company that's going to be going away anytime soon in regards to the level of distribution that they have with consumer devices.</p>
</details>

看看这个数据：谷歌、亚马逊和微软在一个季度内的资本支出总额为1200亿美元。而苹果全年的资本支出仅为127亿美元。所以，苹果基本上是在说，嘿，你们可以花光所有的钱来为英伟达的利润添砖加瓦，而我们将通过把你们整合到我们的分销渠道中，从你们所做的一切中获益。这也是让人对苹果感到兴奋的另一个原因，因为他们不必在资本支出上浪费钱，因为他们不一定需要构建自己的模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take a look at this stat right here. capex now for Google, Amazon and Microsoft in one quarter was 120 billion. Apple spent 12.7 billion for capex in the whole year. So basically Apple's saying hey you guys can spend all the money and and fuel Nvidia's profits. We are going to benefit from whatever you guys do by integrating you into our distribution which is also another reason to get excited about Apple because they don't have to waste the money on Capex because they don't necessarily have to build out old models.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头总结与市场展望

总的来说，作为一名投资者，除了我们昨天得到的结论之外，你不可能有更好的一周了。谷歌表现出色，微软表现出色，亚马逊彻底摧毁了预期，Meta虽然表面看起来不佳，但实际上也表现出色，然后苹果继续保持强势。这就是你所需要的。这真的是我们所需要的。然后你还得到了降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think overall, as an investor, there is not a better week you could have had outside of the conclusion we got to it yesterday. You got Google that crushed it, Microsoft that crushed it, Amazon that demolished it, Meta that did crush it, although the optics didn't look the best, and then Apple that continued to crush it. I mean, this is what you needed. This is really what we needed. And then you got the rate cut.</p>
</details>

现在，今年剩下的唯一能让这出戏继续上演的事情，就是12月份再降息一次，以及英伟达的财报。但我认为我们可以稍微放松一下，至少让市场消化这些大型科技公司的财报，不必为这些公司是否会表现出色而焦虑，因为它们绝对做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the only thing left for this year now to kind of keep this playing out is one more rate cut in December, which, you know, JPOW can say whatever we want, but we're likely going to get it. The number two is uh Nvidia. But I think we can sit back a little bit and at least, you know, allow the market to consume these big tech earnings and not be that anxious about if these companies will crush because they absolutely crushed.</p>
</details>

我认为我们所看到的一切的要点在于，在过去的11个季度里，谷歌、亚马逊、微软和Meta都超出了预期。我认为每个人都开始意识到的一个简单论点是，**Hyperscalers**（超大规模数据中心/云服务提供商: 指像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure、谷歌云这样拥有庞大规模和计算能力的公司）可能会成为我们一生中最容易的投资。在我看来，很难找到比这些公司更容易的投资了。它们影响着我们日常生活的方方面面，拥有支持其研发和增长的自由现金流、净收入和资产负债表，并且最终很可能会继续变得更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and I think the punchline to everything we're seeing, by the way, Amazon was upgraded to 315 at Morgan Stanley and upgraded to 335 at Evercore. So, you're getting upgrades across the board as well. I I think the the thing that's the most important about this is that for the past 11 quarters, Google has beat, Amazon has beat, Microsoft has beat, and Meta has beat. And and I think the simple argument everyone is starting to realize is that the hyperscalers will probably go down as the easiest investments of our lifetime. It is very hard, in my opinion, for us to find easier investments than the companies that impact every single part of all of our lives on a day-to-day basis, have the free cash flow, the net income, the balance sheets to support their R&D and their growth, and ultimately are companies that are likely just going to keep getting bigger.</p>
</details>

### “大空头”归来与市场情绪

顺便提一下，Netflix确实进行了股票拆分，10比1。我不知道他们为什么在昨天晚上宣布，我觉得他们应该在财报时宣布。但现在，我们可以用11,000美元买100股Netflix，而不是111,000美元，这很不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Netflix did do a stock split. Yes. 10 to1. I don't know why they announced it today or yesterday night. Uh I I feel like they should have done it on earnings, but now we'll be able to buy 100 shares of Netflix for $11,000, not $111,000, which is nice. It's not that easy to buy 100 shares for 100 grand, but now we can get them for 11 grand. So Netflix will be splitting their stock.</p>
</details>

现在来谈谈迈克尔·贝瑞。对于那些还没看到的人，迈克尔·贝瑞回来了。这是他的推特账户。自2023年1月31日以来，贝瑞就没发过推文。他上一次发推时，只说了一个词：卖出。自那以后，纳斯达克指数翻了一番。

<p class="english-text">All right, let's talk about Burry. So, uh, for those that haven't seen, Michael Burry is back. This is his Twitter account. And Burry has not tweeted since January 31st, 2023. The last time that Burry tweeted, he said this, sell. The NASDAQ has doubled since that.</p>

昨天他发推说：“有时候我们看到泡沫。有时候我们可以对此做些什么。有时候唯一获胜的举动就是不参与。” 迈克尔·贝瑞先生的论点非常富有诗意。

<p class="english-text">Then yesterday he tweets, "Sometimes we see bubbles. Sometimes there is something to do about it. Sometimes the only winning move is not to play." Very poetic uh argument by Mr. Michael Burry.</p>
</details>

我的看法是：首先，你需要一堵“忧虑之墙”。你需要有人感到害怕。如果没有人害怕，你就不会有牛市，因为我们会变得过于亢奋，然后市场见顶。我认为像贝瑞这样的人出来说“嘿，这是个泡沫”，这实际上是看涨的，因为你需要那些害怕的人来构筑那堵忧虑之墙。其次，这家伙可能因为错过了行情而感到恼火。

<p class="english-text">Look, here's my perspective on this. Number one, uh you need a wall of worry. You need people to be afraid. If you don't have people that are afraid, then you're not going to be able to have a bull market because we get too euphoric and then we top out. I think people like Burry coming out and saying, "Hey, it's a bubble." essentially that's what he's implying uh is bullish because you have people that are scared and you need those people that are scared at the end of the day to create that wall of worry. Number two, the guy is probably annoyed that he missed it.</p>

他因预测了房地产泡沫而闻名，《大空头》是我最喜欢的电影之一。他做对了。但问题是，你做对一件事并不意味着……我们之所以尊敬巴菲特、阿克曼和德鲁肯米勒，是因为他们在职业生涯中一次又一次地做对了。顺便说一下，那些人都是做多的。做空并长期保持正确是非常困难的，因为随着时间的推移，股票往往会上涨，因为公司能够表现出色，世界上最好的公司往往会继续表现出色。

<p class="english-text">He called the housing bubble. And Big Short is one of my favorite movies ever. He got it right. But it's also like just because you get one thing right does like the reason we we look up to Buffett and Ackman and Druckenmiller is because they have a consistent career of being right over and over. And by the way, all those guys go long. It's really hard to be short and be consistently right for a career because stocks tend to go up over time because companies can perform and the best companies in the world tend to keep performing.</p>

### 英伟达CEO的韩国之行与中国市场评论

我要给你们看的关于黄仁勋的视频会显得有些“见顶”的意味，但你必须记住，这是黄仁勋，他可以做他想做的任何事，因为他是黄仁勋。首先，这是黄仁勋与三星和现代的CEO一起，互相挽着胳膊喝交杯酒。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, the videos I'm about to show you are going to scream Toppy, but you just have to remember it's freaking Jensen and he gets to do what he wants because he's Jensen. So, let's start off with a couple of these videos. First of all, uh this is Jensen with the CEO of Samsung and Hyundai uh doing shots while putting while locking each other's arms.</p>
</details>

接下来这段视频是黄仁勋在韩国与一群人交谈，问是否有人是英伟达的投资者，然后人群展示了他们手机上的英伟达股价。你可以看出黄仁勋玩得很开心，人们像对待摇滚明星一样对待他。

<p class="english-text">The next video right here is uh well, take a look at this. You got Jensen in Korea talking to a crowd of people saying, "Is anyone investors?" And then that same crowd responded by showing off their phones with Nvidia stock price. You could tell Jensen's having such a good time. Like people in a crowd are treating him like a rockstar.</p>

关于韩国，有一点如果大家不知道的话，那就是韩国不仅是投资大国之一，而且在期权交易和**DGEN**（Degenerate: 通常指在投资或赌博中采取高风险、非理性策略的人，这里引申为一种高风险的投资文化）投资方面也是如此。韩国的投资社区非常活跃，他们会聚集起来押注某只股票。

<p class="english-text">Now, one thing if people don't know about South Korea, and I found this out actually over the past couple months, South Korea is one of the biggest countries when it comes to not only investing, but when it comes to two things, option trading and DGEN investing. When I mean DGEN investing, I mean communities that form in South Korea that uh come together to be able to bet on a stock has happened for various companies over the past really decade and it's only accelerating.</p>
</details>

那么，他为什么在韩国呢？嗯，他正在签署一些协议，并与韩国媒体交谈，继续论证为什么英伟达应该处于现在的位置。他正在与SK海力士和三星达成几笔交易。总体交易总结如下：英伟达将出货26万颗GPU。三星将为其新的人工智能工厂获得5万颗GPU，SK集团获得5万颗，Navercloud获得5万颗。三星已经为其生产所有英伟达的机器人处理器。所以他去韩国是为了真正巩固这些交易。看起来这次旅行是成功的。

<p class="english-text">Now, why is he in South Korea? Well, he's signing some deals and he's talking to the media in South Korea and, you know, continuing to make the argument for why Nvidia deserves to be at the spot that it is. He's making a couple of deals with SK Hynix and Samsung. So the overall deal is summarized right here. Uh Nvidia will ship 260,000 GPUs. Samsung will get 50,000 GPUs for its new AI factory. SK Group 50,000 then Navercloud 50,000. Samsung already manufactures all of its Nvidia's robotics processor. So the reason he went to South Korea was to really solidify these deals. And it looks like this was a successful trip.</p>

这是他将拜登政府就其中国业务问题推上风口浪尖的另一个视频。他说：“英伟达曾拥有中国95%的市场份额。如今，我们拥有0%。在拜登政府初期，我们拥有95%。该政府的政策确实导致我们几乎失去了整个中国市场。”他还补充说，如果能全面进入中国市场，每年可能会带来350到500亿美元的收入，到这个十年末可能远超1000亿美元。

<p class="english-text">Here's him throwing the Biden administration under the bus in regards to their China business. "Well, Nvidia had 95% of the China market. Today, we have 0%. Um, at the beginning of the Biden administration, we had 95%. And the the policies of that administration really caused us to lose practically the entire China market. I would guess that China is probably something like, you know, 35 to 50 billion dollars a year to us if we're fully in that market today. and by the end of the decade it's probably you know well over a hundred billion dollars."</p>

Palantir gets 200. 200.30 at the opening bell. Robin Hood up 5%. Nvidia up two. Tesla up two.</p>

### 财报季观察：Coinbase与Reddit表现亮眼

Reddit也表现出色。这些家伙正在飞速增长。同比增长68%，毛利率91%，调整后EBITDA盈利，利润率40%，日活跃用户同比增长20%至1.16亿。我从不看好Reddit的估值，尤其是在它涨到100多美元时，但我后来就忘了它。他们在增长，而且看起来没有放缓的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reddit crushed it as well. These guys are crushing it. These when you talk about a growth company, these guys are freaking growing. And it's pretty incredible to see. 68% year-over-year growth. Gross margins at 91%. Profitable adjusted EBITDA has a 40% margin. Daily active uniques up 20% year-over-year to 116 million. I mean, look, I never love the valuation of Reddit, especially when it started getting into the high 100s and I kind of forgot about it.</p>
</details>

Coinbase的财报也很好，营收和利润双双超预期。令人难以置信的收入数据，指引也很好。Coinbase确实表现出色。但在电话会议结束时发生了一件事，Brian Armstrong说：“我有点分心，因为我正在追踪关于Coinbase下次财报电话会议会说什么的预测市场。我只是想在这里加上比特币、以太坊、区块链、质押和Web3这些词，以确保我们在电话会议结束前提到它们。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coinbase also crushed on earnings, but they beat on the top and the bottom. Incredible revenue numbers. Guidance was good. I mean, Coinbase really did crush it. The headline on Coinbase though was this that happened at the end of the call. "I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call and I just want to you know add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain staking and web 3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call."</p>
</details>

听着，我认为Brian Armstrong非常了不起，我真心觉得他只是在开玩笑。但他这样做给人的观感很差。这让人不禁联想到阴谋论。这也显示了赌博文化已经多么深入地渗透到我们的生活中。坦率地说，我认为Brian Armstrong这么做是因为，我感觉Coinbase将要推出预测市场。为什么不呢？他们有分销渠道、生态系统和技术。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Okay, so look, I think Brian Armstrong is incredible and I genuinely think he was just having fun with it. But the perception was so bad in my opinion. It goes to show how deep the gambling culture has infiltrated our lives. And quite frankly, I think the reason Brian Armstrong did that is because, and I feel like Coinbase is going to launch prediction markets. Why wouldn't they? They have the distribution. They have the ecosystem. They have the technology.</p>

### 宏观视角：通胀对冲与盈利增长预期

摩根士丹利的Mike Wilson最近的播客中有些有趣的观点。他认为，股市上涨有两个原因。首先，市场某些领域的增长相当不错。其次，也是让人们大跌眼镜的一点是，股票基本上是一种通胀对冲工具，尤其是高质量的股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the first thing he said that was pretty interesting around how he thinks about why the S&P 500 is going up in comparison to inflation. "Second reason which is the one that people's heads explode on is that stocks are basically an inflation hedge. Okay, particularly high quality stocks. S&P 500 being best case in point, NASDAQ even more so."</p>
</details>

他认为，市场正在展望明年，并认为美联储将降息，如果经济进入新的复苏周期，盈利可能会比人们想象的要好。因此，市场正在为优于目前模型预测的13-14%的盈利增长定价。他认为可能接近20%，这也是为什么市盈率可能不像人们想象的那么高的一个原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the market is looking forward to next year and saying, "Hey, the Fed's going to be cutting. Earnings are actually going to be probably better than people think if we're in a new economic recovery." And so it's pricing in better earnings growth than what the market is modeling today, which is 13-14%. I think it could be something closer to 20, which is one reason why multiples maybe aren't as expensive as people think.</p>
</details>

他还指出，过去三年，罗素3000指数中位数股票的盈利增长为负，现在才刚刚开始好转。这些公司变得非常高效，如果经济进入新周期，并且我们有通货膨胀——顺便说一句，这对盈利是好事——那么盈利能力将会很强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the last three years the median stock okay the median stock in the Russell 3000 that's large and small has had negative earnings growth okay for three years straight and it's just starting to turn up now. So what's going on? We're seeing better revenue growth and we're seeing operating leverage because these companies have gotten so efficient now. And if we get a new economic cycle and we get inflation which by the way is good for earnings. This is another different view that I have others. I think if we get if we don't get inflation next year, there's no chance of getting 20% earnings growth.</p>

### 尾声与展望

好的，我想今天的主要故事就是这些了。亚马逊和苹果业绩出色，财报季表现良好，大盘对此反应积极。标普指数虽未创历史新高，但已非常接近。Meta继续被抛售，Palantir突破200美元，Robin Hood达到150美元，Coinbase上涨10%。下周我们还有一系列财报，让我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so I guess the big stories of the day are essentially Amazon and Apple crushed. Earnings are good. Broader market likes it. S&P not at alltime highs, but close to it. Meta continues to get dumped. Palantir 200, Robin Hood 150, Coinbase up 10%. And then next week we have a whole string of earnings to see where else this goes. I think that's pretty much it.</p>
</details>

周一将是重要的一天。首先，我们有Palantir，这总是大事。现在股价在财报前已经上涨，我们将看看财报数据如何，以及股价会发生什么。其次，我非常关注的新成员Grab也将发布财报。所以周一对我来说将是充满焦虑的一天，我们将看看结果如何。但这将是重要的一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Monday is gonna be a big one for two reasons. Number one, we have Palantir, which is always big, and that's important. And now that the stock has run before earnings, we're going to see how the numbers come out and what ends up happening to the stock. So, that's important. And also because the newest addition to the name that I really associate myself with is Grab and that's going to have earnings as well. So Monday is just going to be a very anxiety producing day for me across the board and we're going to see how it turns out. But it'll be a big week.</p>
</details>

祝大家万圣节快乐。如果还有万圣节照片，请在推特上发布并标记我，我很乐意在屏幕上与大家分享。下周还有AMD、Robin Hood的财报，下周将会非常重要。我们本周的财报季和美联储会议都取得了成功。现在，如果我们能继续保持这种势头，那将非常令人兴奋。

AMD next week, Robin Hood next week. I mean, next week's just going to be massive. So, we got a lot of stuff. And you know, we had a successful week with earnings, successful Fed meeting. Now, if we can just continue that, it'll be very exciting to keep this going. So there you go.</p>
