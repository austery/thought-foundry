### 财报周的疯狂与市场的狂欢

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是10月31日，星期五。祝大家万圣节快乐。我没有打扮，因为这周是今年最疯狂的一周之一，我几乎都没怎么出门。基本上每天都有七到八小时的直播，甚至还有九小时的。说实话，我实在没准备服装，抱歉。这周太狂野了。我想，你可以叫我一个在财报周后筋疲力尽的股市YouTube博主。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Friday, October 31st. Happy Halloween to everybody. I did not dress up because this week has been one of the most wild weeks this year. I have barely went outside this week. So, nine-hour streams basically seven to eight hour streams every day outside of the nine hour stream. I mean, I just don't have an outfit. I'm sorry. This was a wild week. I guess you can call me a stock market YouTuber who is absolutely exhausted after a week of earnings.</p>
</details>

但这一切都是值得的，因为标普500指数正处于历史最高点。我们还有亚马逊，它的财报简直是摧枯拉朽。亚马逊现在的股价是252.65美元。我想我今天算是装扮成了“因亚马逊而富有”的人，估计我们很多人都是这个装扮。是的，我们正在直播市场开盘，感谢大家的到来。希望大家这周过得愉快。这周真是漫长，发生了太多事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's worth it given S&P 500 right here is at alltime highs. And we've got Amazon, which we'll talk about that absolutely demolished earnings. Amazon right here, 252.65. I guess I dressed up as rich on Amazon today. That's I guess you can say a lot of us dressed up with that. Yeah, we're live and we're here for the market open. Thank you everybody for being here. I hope everyone has been having a good week. It's been a long week. It's been a long freaking week. There's just been so much going on.</p>
</details>

这周虽然令人兴奋，但我们正进入2025年的最后冲刺阶段。所以，这一周的表现至关重要。我们需要大型科技公司的财报表现良好，需要美联储降息。归根结底，这都是真金白银。我知道我们都看着数字和K线图上下波动，但最终，这些股票每涨跌一美元，都会以某种方式影响到我们和我们的家庭。所以，我们需要一个好的一周，而看起来我们确实度过了一个相对不错的一周，希望我们能在这个周五强势收官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again this has been an exciting week, but we're getting into the home stretch of 2025. So this is one of those weeks that we really needed to have as a good week. And we needed big tech earnings to be good. We needed the Fed to cut. We you know all of us this is real money at the end of the day. I know we all look at numbers and candlesticks go up and down, but at the end of the day, every dollar of these stocks up or down does affect all of us in some way and affect our families. So, we needed a good week and it looks like we got a relatively good week and hopefully we can end out the week pretty strong on this Friday.</p>
</details>

即使昨天标普指数下跌了1%，我甚至不知道为什么，我认为那次回调没有任何实质性的原因，但现在我们在盘前市场基本上又涨回来了1%。我们昨天失去的，今天几乎都收复了。这很可能是因为亚马逊和苹果公司发布了惊人的财报。顺便说一下，苹果股价达到了276美元，一度触及284美元。他们的财报非常出色，我们稍后会讨论。Reddit上涨了10%，亚马逊显然上涨了13%，这是非常重要的一天。Meta也开始从650美元的低点有所回升。Palantir开盘后可能会冲击200美元，这将是很好的景象。英伟达回到了200美元以上，特斯拉446美元，Robin Hood 141美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even yesterday when we had that 1% decline on the S&P, which I don't even know why. I don't think there's any meaningful reason for why we had that draw down. We're back basically up 1% in the pre-markets. Everything that we lost, we are pretty much getting back. And it's likely because Amazon and Apple just had monster earnings. Apple, by the way, 276. At one point, it hit 284. So, they had an they had a great earnings, then they crushed it. We'll talk about that. Reddit, it's up 10%. Amazon obviously 13%. Massive, massive day. They crushed it. Meta starting to recover a little bit from the lows at 650. Palantir, I think it's going to try to push 200 when the market opens, which will be great to see. Nvidia back above 200. Tesla 446. Robin Hood 141.</p>
</details>

比特币和以太坊也开始有所复苏。比特币在109.6美元，昨天曾跌至105美元。以太坊曾跌至3700美元，现在回到3850美元。我知道它们一直滞后。比特币需要上涨约7000美元才能让十月份收绿。但无论如何，盘前市场出现了一些回升势头，这是非常好的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin and Ethereum starting to get a little bit more recovery. Bitcoin at 109.6. It fell to 105 yesterday. Ethereum fell to 3,700 back at 3850. I know they've been lagging. And Bitcoin's got to have like a $7,000 candle to end green for October. Um, but regardless, you do have a little bit of momentum coming back in the pre-market, which is very nice to see as we get into it.</p>
</details>

下周也将是疯狂的一周。周一有Palantir，这是一个重头戏。还有Grab。周三好像是Hood。所以下周将是极其重要的一周。本周对股市很重要，下周则对我的投资组合非常重要，对许多长期持有这些股票的人也很重要。目前，标普500公司中已有40%发布了财报。所以，这是我们必须度过的一周。虽然漫长，但我们挺过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next week's also going to be crazy. Monday, we've got Palantir. That's a big one. We also have Grab on Monday. So, you know, and then we have Hood I think on Wednesday. So, it's just going to be a massive massive week next week. This was really important for the stock market next week is really important for my portfolio. Also really important for a lot of people that are long those names. And we are pretty much done with 40% of big tech earnings or of the S&P 500 earnings. And so, this was one of those weeks we had to get through. And it was a long week, but we got through it and we are here.</p>
</details>

### 亚马逊财报震撼市场：AWS增长重燃希望

让我们从亚马逊开始。今天必须先谈亚马逊。我们有很多宏观问题要讨论，但亚马逊是今天的重头戏。让我们看看发生了什么。首先，恭喜所有持有亚马逊股票的人。我想我们在频道上公开讨论亚马逊大约是在一个月前，也就是九月初。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. Let's get into it. Let's start off with Amazon. We got to start off with Amazon. We got a bunch of different macro stuff to talk about, but Amazon is the big one today. And let's cover what happened. So, first of all, congratulations to everyone in Amazon. I think on the channel publicly, we started really talking about Amazon basically a month ago. Call it early September.</p>
</details>

它引起我兴趣的原因是，尽管纳斯达克指数年初至今上涨了近20%，标普500指数上涨了11%，但亚马逊的股价却是负增长。这是我在九月中旬发的一个帖子。当时我认为它下跌的两个原因是：关税可能影响其电商业务，以及**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊提供的云计算服务）业务不再那么令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason for that, it kind of just piqued my interest. It was that the stock was negative year-to- date, although the NASDAQ was up almost 20%, the S&P 500 was up 11%. And so this was the post I made. Yeah. Towards the middle of September, as you can see right here, and the two reasons I thought it was going down, tariffs might affect their commerce business, AWS not as exciting.</p>
</details>

当时的核心论点很简单，就是它不应该以这样的水平交易。当时股价是222美元，我就是在那时建仓的。后来它跌到了212美元。我想我们很多人都达成了共识：这是地球上最重要的公司之一，它应该被这样对待吗？从技术上讲，如果AWS无法实现增长，它确实应该。那么，安迪·贾西昨天交出了什么答卷呢？他带来了AWS的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the thesis simply was, and there was a lot of comments and engagement under these posts that just like it doesn't deserve to be trading at these levels. And this was at 222. That's when I initiated the position. It ends up going down to 212. And I think all of us kind of came together and said, "This is one of the most important companies on the planet. Do they deserve to be treated the way they're being treated?" And it's technically yeah, they do if they can't get the growth from AWS. And so what did Jassy deliver yesterday? He delivered the growth on AWS.</p>
</details>

这就是改变一切的关键。有时候事情真的很简单，华尔街只需要一件事来改变看法。一旦你满足了华尔街的需求，一切都会改变。线上商店同比增长10%，第三方卖家服务同比增长12%，而亚马逊网络服务（AWS）增长了20%。这才是重头戏。实体店增长7%，订阅服务11%，广告业务增长24%，季度运行率达到180亿美元，这简直不可思议。我们对广告业务的讨论不够多，但这是一个高利润业务，亚马逊在这方面持续表现出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is kind of what changed anything. I mean, sometimes it's really simple. Sometimes it's one thing that the street needs for a change. And once you give what the street needs, everything changes. Online stores up 10% year-over-year. Third party seller services up 12% year-over-year. Amazon web services 20%. That's the big one. Physical stores 7%, subscriptions 11%, and then advertising 24% at an $18 billion quarterly run rate, which is just incredible. I mean, we don't talk enough about the advertising business, but high margin business and Amazon continues to crush it.</p>
</details>

贾西说了什么？他说：“自2022年以来，我们从未见过如此强劲的AWS增长。”就是这句话。他一说完，一切就尘埃落定了。我不知道亚马逊能否维持目前14%的涨幅，但我确实认为它很难再回到220美元。我认为它在盘前市场能保持这种势头而没有回落的原因是，当贾西说：“各位，我们已经快三年没见过这种增长了”，华尔街就会注意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what did Jassy say? He said, "We haven't seen this type of AWS growth since 2022." That's it. As soon as he said that, it was over. And I don't know if Amazon's going to hold the 14% move right now. I definitely think it's going to be harder to go back to 220. But I do think that the reason it's actually maintaining this momentum in the pre-market and it's not getting faded away is because when Jassy says, "Guys, we have not seen this type of growth in almost three years. The street pays attention."</p>
</details>

华尔街最关心的是什么？他们关心我们一直在讨论的一件事，那就是AWS的加速增长。顺便说一下，他们公布的增长率是20.2%，而**Whisper Number**（耳语数字：指华尔街分析师私下流传但未公开的盈利预测）是18.9%。所以他们超过了耳语数字。当你超过那个数字时，你就赢了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what does the street care about the most? They care about the one thing we've been talking about, which is AWS acceleration. The whisper number, by the way, they came in at 20.2%. The whisper number was 18.9%. So, they beat the whisper number. The whisper number is like the number that Wall Street is literally whispering about, but is not the actual number they're expecting. When you beat that number, you win. When you beat that number, you win. And it's really hard to lose.</p>
</details>

贾西在电话会议上说：“第四季度将新增1吉瓦的电力容量，并预计到2027年将负载能力翻倍。电力仍然是Trainium需求的主要行业瓶颈。我们的定制Trainium 2芯片已全部被预订，其性价比优于竞争对手30%到40%。”他们基本上是在亚马逊内部建立了一个小型的英伟达，而其估值只有英伟达的一半。当然，他们的增长不如英伟达，但关键在于，你得到的是一个年初至今几乎没有上涨的公司。现在它上涨了大约14%。它的护城河是真正无法否认的，而且它是那种会长久存在的公司之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jassy on the call said, "Another 1 gigawatt coming in Q4 and expect to double load capacity by 2027. Power remains the main industry bottleneck on the Trainium demand. Our custom Trainium 2 chips are fully subscribed with 30 to 40% better price performance than competitors. They're basically building a little bit of a mini Nvidia inside of Amazon, trading at half the valuation of Nvidia. Obviously, they don't have as much growth as Nvidia, but the point is you're getting something that barely is up here to date. Now, it's up around 14%. And the moat is a moat that truly just can't be denied, and it is one of those companies that's going to be around for a long time.</p>
</details>

大型和中型客户的需求依然强劲。Trainium 3将在今年晚些时候预展，预计2026年初实现全面量产。这是一家不会消失的公司。从长远来看，250美元的股价可能会成为投资组合的基石，而且很可能仍然很便宜。当然，在经历了这样的上涨之后，我今天可能不会追高。但无论如何，如果你准备长期持有，这家公司将会长期存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Demand remains strong across large and midsize customers. Trainium 3 will preview later this year with full volumes expected in early 2026. I mean again, this was one of those companies that's like it's not going anywhere. It could become a cornerstone of the portfolio at 250 over the long term. It likely is still cheap, right? I probably wouldn't chase it today after the run that it's having. But nonetheless, if you're ready to hold on to this for a long time, then this company's going to be here for a long time.</p>
</details>

关于**Capex**（Capital Expenditures: 资本支出，即公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金），他们今年将花费1250亿美元，高于预期的约1180亿美元。对于2026财年，他们预计将花费超过1250亿美元。所以资本支出已经安排好了，这对半导体公司，尤其是英伟达来说是好事。我想这就是为什么英伟达现在股价上涨的原因。他们不提供股息或股票回购，所以他们可以只对业务进行再投资，因为他们不必回报外部股东。华尔街也因此奖励他们，因为他们实现了增长。如果你不给我们股息或回购，那就给我们增长。贾西做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Capex, they're going to be spending 125 billion this year. So that's up from the expectations of around 118 billion. And then for fiscal year 2026, they are projecting to spend more than 125 billion. So you've got the capex taken care of, which is really good for the semiconductor names, especially Nvidia. I think that's why Nvidia is up right now. They're not giving you a dividend or a share buyback. So they can only reinvest into the business because they don't have to reward external shareholders. And the street's rewarding them for that because they got the growth. Like if you're not going to give us a dividend or share buyback, give us the growth. Jassy deliver the growth.</p>
</details>

第三，他们的营业利润率从11.8%下降到9.4%，但据我了解，这主要是由于裁员和一次性的遣散费。所以可以想象，营业利润率仍然在12%左右。如果他们在未来五年内将其提高到接近15%到20%，那么这家公司的营业收入可能会达到2000亿美元。这样的公司估值可能会接近4到5万亿美元，基本上是从现在翻倍。所以，说“我要长期持有亚马逊股票”并不可怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then number three, their operating margins were down from 11.8% to 9.4%, but from my understanding, this was more so because of the layoffs and one-time severance charges. So imagine operating margins are still at 12%. Again, if they increase that closer to 15 20% over the next five years, you're talking about a company that's likely going to be doing 200 billion in operating income. And that is a company that probably gets closer to the $4-5 trillion valuation, which is basically a double from here. And so it's not that scary to say, "Hey, I'm going to hold on to Amazon stock for a long time."</p>
</details>

确实，营业收入同比持平，自由现金流的增长方式也不如谷歌和微软。他们之所以在**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）上超出预期30%，是因为他们确认了对Anthropic的投资收益。他们对Anthropic的投资获得了94亿美元的收益，还有另一家他们投资的初创公司，这让他们在EPS上超出了预期。但坦率地说，即使他们错过了EPS，我也不认为股价会上涨15%，但也不至于下跌15%。原因在于，唯一真正重要的故事是AWS。这确实是华尔街唯一想看到的东西。华尔街得到了它，而且是在一个远高于预期的数字上，这让你知道AI工作负载的需求是强劲的，而亚马逊正在满足这种需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, operating income was flat year-over-year. That is true. And free cash flow is not growing the way Google and Microsoft is growing. The one reason they beat on EPS, by the way, they beat by 30% is because they recognized their investment from Anthropic. So again, they have a $9.4 billion gain from Anthropic and another startup they invested in and that allowed them to beat on EPS. But quite frankly, even if they missed on EPS, I don't know if the stock would be up 15%, but I don't think it would be down 15%. And the reason for that is because the only story that really mattered was AWS. This is literally the only thing the street wanted to see. And the fact that the street got it and they got it at a number that was way above expectations, that lets you know the demand for AI workloads is strong and Amazon is fulfilling that demand.</p>
</details>

因此，随着股价持续上涨，你看到了一些很好的势头。恭喜所有持有亚马逊的人。这对散户投资者来说是一次巨大的胜利，是我们许多人共同努力的结果。聊天室里有很多人给我发帖子、私信，说：“嘿，你得看看这个。”看，亚马逊不是最难持有的股票。只是当一只股票相对于同行下跌时，你会开始觉得自己像个傻瓜，因为你买的不是当时的赢家。但机会就在那里，alpha就在那里。我想，投资时间越长，人们就越会意识到alpha存在于无人关注的地方。谢天谢地，过去两个月人们没有关注亚马逊。结果，人们得以在这家公司建仓，现在我们享受到了收益。这绝对是令人难以置信的，亚马逊的财报非常棒，再次恭喜所有持有亚马逊的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, you're getting some great momentum as the stock continues to move. So very very nice to see. Congrats to everyone at Amazon. This was a big retail victory. Uh definitely a big retail victory for a lot of us that came together. So many of you in the chat tagged me in post and sent me DMs and said, "Hey, you got to look at this. You got to look at this." And like it was, look, Amazon's not the hardest stock to own. It's just whenever a stock is down relative to its peers, you start to feel like an idiot buying this stock over the winners because it's obviously not the winner at the time. But that's when the opportunity is. That's where the alpha is. And I think, you know, the longer everyone invests, the more they realize the alpha is where everyone is not looking at. And thankfully, people weren't looking at freaking Amazon for the past two months. And as a result, you know, people got to take a position in the company and now we get to benefit from the gains. So absolutely incredible, great Amazon earnings and congrats to everyone who is in Amazon as well.</p>

### 苹果业绩稳健，科技巨头整体强势

接下来谈谈苹果。苹果也表现出色。关于苹果最让我意外的是，他们上调了第四季度的指引，将收入增长预期提高到10%至12%。如果我没记错的话，苹果已经有近两年没有实现10%至12%的收入增长了。他们一直徘徊在3%到4%。所以，我们能看到这样的收入增长，非常令人兴奋。EPS为1.85美元，高于预期的1.77美元；营收为1020亿美元，与预期持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Apple. So let's talk Apple. Apple crushed it as well. So, the big thing about Apple that crushed it, which I really didn't expect, is that they increased their guidance for Q4. And that guidance ended up getting increased to 10 to 12% revenue growth. Apple has not done 10 to 12% revenue growth in almost two years if I'm not wrong. They've always been at 3 to 4%. And so, as a result, you know, we just haven't seen that type of revenue growth. And the fact that we got it was very exciting. 5% EPS, 1.85 versus 1.77, and then 102 versus 102 billion.</p>
</details>

营收同比增长8%，EPS同比增长13%。蒂姆·库克基本上表示，他对iPhone 17非常兴奋，对他们在中国看到的势头感到兴奋，尽管本季度在中国的业绩未达预期。iPhone的销量也略有下降，但幅度很小。他还对长期存在的整体AI机遇感到非常兴奋。结果，华尔街对此非常买账。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Revenues up 8% year-over-year EPS is up 13. Uh Tim Cook basically said he's really excited for iPhone 17. He's really excited for the momentum they're seeing in China, even though they missed on China this quarter. iPhone also missed. It was a very slight miss, but nonetheless, it missed. And he's also very excited for the overall AI opportunity that exists long term. And as a result, the street ate it up. I mean, the street absolutely ate it up.</p>
</details>

在我看来，考虑到苹果缺乏增长，它的估值相当高，但他们也拥有1320亿美元的现金。他们持续回购股票。而且归根结底，就其消费设备的覆盖范围而言，这家公司短期内不会消失。我会在这里买入苹果吗？不会。但话说回来，除了ETF，我在198美元时也没有买入苹果。所以，我买不买，你买不买，都不重要。重要的是市场是否在买。鉴于苹果占标普500指数的7%，人们是否继续购买对指数至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a company that's trading at a pretty aggressive multiple in my opinion for the lack of growth that they're putting up, but they also have 132 billion in cash. They are consistently buying back their stock. And at the end of the day, this is probably not a company that's going to be going away anytime soon in regards to the level of distribution that they have with consumer devices. Would I be buying Apple here? No. But then again, I haven't been buying Apple at 198 outside of in the ETF. So, it doesn't matter if I'm buying it or if you're buying it. It matters if the market's buying it. And given Apple is 7% of the S&P 500. It really matters for the S&P 500 if people are still buying it.</p>
</details>

请记住，人们在过去几十年里一直持有苹果股票。只要他们不卖出，并因为看到苹果未来的潜力而继续持有，苹果的护城河就不仅仅在于其数字，更在于其业务的规模和速度。我认为这就是为什么苹果的交易方式能够持续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And remember, people have owned Apple for the past couple decades. And as long as they're not selling and they're continuing to hold on because they see that future belief in what Apple can become, Apple really having a moat outside of its numbers, but more so having a moat in terms of the scale and velocity of its business. I think that's why Apple continues to trade the way it trades.</p>
</details>

看看这个数据：谷歌、亚马逊和微软在一个季度内的资本支出总额为1200亿美元。而苹果全年的资本支出仅为127亿美元。所以苹果基本上是在说，你们可以花所有的钱来为英伟达的利润添砖加瓦，而我们将通过把你们整合到我们的分销渠道中来从你们所做的一切中受益。这也是另一个让人对苹果感到兴奋的原因，因为他们不必在资本支出上浪费钱，因为他们不一定需要构建旧模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take a look at this stat right here. Capex now for Google, Amazon and Microsoft in one quarter was 120 billion. Apple spent 12.7 billion for capex in the whole year. So basically Apple's saying hey you guys can spend all the money and fuel Nvidia's profits. We are going to benefit from whatever you guys do by integrating you into our distribution which is also another reason to get excited about Apple because they don't have to waste the money on Capex because they don't necessarily have to build out old models.</p>
</details>

理论上，如果几年前他们决定构建自己的苹果大语言模型，那会是正确的选择吗？也许吧。那可能会改变我们对苹果作为一家AI公司的看法，但他们没有这么做。结果，他们宁愿回购股票，让Meta、OpenAI和谷歌去做，然后在未来与他们合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, theoretically, a couple years ago, if they decided to build their own Apple LLM, would that have been the right choice? Maybe. Maybe that would have changed kind of how we think of Apple as an AI company, but they didn't. And as a result, they'd rather buy back their stock and let Meta and OpenAI do it and Google and just partner with them in the future.</p>

### 超大规模云服务商的投资逻辑

所以，我认为作为一名投资者，除了我们昨天得到的结论之外，你不可能有更好的一周了。当然，如果Meta表现更好，这一周会更完美，但在我看来，华尔街对Meta的反应是愚蠢的。他们不得不支付税款，所以对税收冲销产生了反应。其次，他们对Meta在资本支出上的投入感到不满。我认为你只需要相信扎克伯格，相信资本支出会取得回报。如果你不相信他，那就不要投资。但如果你相信，并且考虑到Meta现在的交易价格是2026年盈利的20倍，鉴于他们很可能继续以25%至30%的速度增长，这确实感觉相对便宜。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I think overall, as an investor, there is not a better week you could have had outside of the conclusion we got to it yesterday. Now, obviously, Meta could have really helped the week go a lot better, but then again, in my opinion, I think the street is being stupid about Meta. They had to pay their taxes, and so they had an reaction to the tax charge off. And then number two, they're mad that Meta is spending on capex. I think you just got to trust Zuck's that the capex is going to play out. And if you don't trust Zuck, then you don't invest. But if you do, and you know, Meta now trading at 20 times 2026 earnings, it does feel relatively cheap given they're likely going to continue to grow at 25 to 30%.</p>
</details>

所以，谷歌表现出色，微软表现出色，亚马逊更是摧枯拉朽。谷歌股价在285美元，Meta虽然表面看起来不佳，但实际上也表现出色，然后苹果继续表现出色。这就是你所需要的。这真的是我们所需要的。然后你还得到了降息。所以，今年剩下的唯一能让这一切继续下去的事情就是12月份再次降息，不管鲍威尔怎么说，我们很可能会得到。第二件事是英伟达。但我认为我们可以稍微放松一下，至少让市场消化这些大型科技公司的财报，不必为这些公司是否会表现出色而焦虑，因为他们绝对做到了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, you got Google that crushed it, Microsoft that crushed it, Amazon that demolished it, Google right there at 285, Meta that did crush it, although the optics didn't look the best, and then Apple that continued to crush it. I mean, this is what you needed. This is really what we needed. And then you got the rate cut. So, the only thing left for this year now to kind of keep this playing out is one more rate cut in December, which, you know, JPOW can say whatever we want, but we're likely going to get it. The number two is Nvidia. But I think we can sit back a little bit and at least, you know, allow the market to consume these big tech earnings and not be that anxious about if these companies will crush because they absolutely crushed.</p>
</details>

我认为我们所看到的一切的要点是，在过去11个季度里，谷歌、亚马逊、微软和Meta都超出了预期。我认为每个人都开始意识到的一个简单论点是，**Hyperscalers**（超大规模云服务提供商：指像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云这样能提供海量计算和存储能力的公司）可能会成为我们一生中最容易的投资之一。在我看来，很难找到比这些公司更容易的投资了，它们影响着我们日常生活的方方面面，拥有支持其研发和增长的自由现金流、净收入和资产负
债表，并且最终很可能会继续变得更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and I think the punchline to everything we're seeing, by the way, Amazon was upgraded to 315 at Morgan Stanley and upgraded to 335 at Evercore. So, you're getting upgrades across the board as well. I think the thing that's the most important about this is that for the past 11 quarters, Google has beat, Amazon has beat, Microsoft has beat, and Meta has beat. And and I think the simple argument everyone is starting to realize is that the hyperscalers will probably go down as the easiest investments of our lifetime. It is very hard, in my opinion, for us to find easier investments than the companies that impact every single part of all of our lives on a day-to-day basis, have the free cash flow, the net income, the balance sheets to support their R&D and their growth, and ultimately are companies that are likely just going to keep getting bigger.</p>
</details>

这开始让我思考2026年的投资组合配置，其中相当一部分可能会更多地投入到这些超大规模云服务提供商中，尤其是在它们下跌时，而不是去寻找下一个大牛股。当然，如果你想在一两年内获得三到四倍的超额回报，寻找下一个大牛股非常重要。但如果你想要稳定持续的收益，同时又能高枕无忧，那么超大规模云服务提供商似乎很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is starting to make me think about 2026 portfolio allocation and a decent part of that allocation might be to go a little heavier into the hyperscalers, especially on these dips, versus having to find that next big stock, which yes is very important if you want the like increased 3x 4x alpha in a year or two years but if you want a steady consistent gain while being able to sleep at night and not have too many worries it seems like the hyperscalers are important.</p>

### 其他市场动态：Netflix拆股与贝瑞的警告

顺便说一句，政府关门的问题还没解决。特朗普整晚都在发推文，说民主党需要解决问题，我不知道这事什么时候能了结。越来越多的人开始感到不安，想知道这到底是怎么回事，而两党都在互相指责。我们已经进入第30天了。希望这能尽快解决，但显然市场并不在乎。最终它会产生影响，但我们希望他们能尽快解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">shutdown is still here we don't have the shutdown resolved yet I mean Trump's been tweeting all night about how the Democrats need to fix stuff and I don't know when that stuff's going to get resolved. I mean you are starting to get a lot more people in the country just what I'm seeing an anecdotally get a bit more upset and wondering why the hell is this happening and you got each side trying to blame the other side but I don't know we're in what day 30 almost of this. So hopefully this gets resolved but obviously the market doesn't care about it. Eventually it will but we're going to hopefully need them to resolve this pretty soon.</p>
</details>

Netflix确实进行了**股票分割**（Stock Split: 将一股股票拆分成多股，以降低单股价格，增加流动性），比例是10比1。我不知道他们为什么选择在昨天晚上宣布。我觉得他们应该在财报时宣布，但现在我们可以用11000美元买到100股Netflix，而不是111000美元，这很好。花10万美元买100股并不容易，但现在我们用11000美元就能买到。所以Netflix将要拆股了。我想生效日期是几周后，但我们很快就会看到这次拆股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Netflix did do a stock split. Yes. 10 to 1. I don't know why they announced it today or yesterday night. I feel like they should have done it on earnings, but now we'll be able to buy 100 shares of Netflix for $11,000, not $111,000, which is nice. It's not that easy to buy 100 shares for 100 grand, but now we can get them for 11 grand. So Netflix will be splitting their stock. I think the effective date is like in a couple weeks, but we will be seeing this stock split pretty soon.</p>
</details>

好了，我们来谈谈迈克尔·贝瑞。对于那些还没看到的人，他回来了。这是他的推特账户。自2023年1月31日以来，贝瑞就没发过推文。他上一次发推文时，只说了一个词：“卖出”。从那时起，纳斯达克指数已经翻了一番。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's talk about Burry. So, for those that haven't seen, Michael Burry is back. This is his Twitter account. And Burry has not tweeted since January 31st, 2023. The last time that Burry tweeted, he said this, sell. The NASDAQ has doubled since that.</p>
</details>

有点疯狂，你知道吗。他说了一个词“卖出”，然后在1月31日删除了那条推文，那几乎就是市场的底部，虽然不是字面上的最低点，但非常接近。底部是在2022年10月。然后他就消失了，过去两年里没有发过推文。昨天，他发推说：“有时候我们看到泡沫。有时候我们可以对此做些什么。有时候唯一能赢的举动就是不参与。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of crazy, you know. He said one word sell. He deleted that tweet after on January 31st, which it was not literally the bottom, but it was very close to the bottom. The bottom was October 2022. and he disappeared. He has not tweeted in the past two years. Then yesterday he tweets, "Sometimes we see bubbles. Sometimes there is something to do about it. Sometimes the only winning move is not to play."</p>
</details>

迈克尔·贝瑞先生的论点非常富有诗意。看，这是我的看法。首先，你需要一堵“忧虑之墙”。你需要有人害怕。如果没有人害怕，那么你就不会有牛市，因为我们会变得过于兴奋，然后市场见顶。我认为像贝瑞这样的人出来说“嘿，这是个泡沫”，实际上是看涨的，因为你需要那些害怕的人来创造那堵忧虑之墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very poetic argument by Mr. Michael Burry. Look, here's my perspective on this. Number one, you need a wall of worry. You need people to be afraid. If you don't have people that are afraid, then you're not going to be able to have a bull market because we get too euphoric and then we top out. I think people like Burry coming out and saying, "Hey, it's a bubble." essentially that's what he's implying is bullish because you have people that are scared and you need those people that are scared at the end of the day to create that wall of worry.</p>
</details>

第二，这家伙可能因为错过了行情而感到恼火。我知道他有一些交易，比如雅诗兰黛和阿里巴巴等。但如果你只是投资美国，贝瑞并不是一个糟糕的选股者，如果你选择了几只“七巨头”股票，他本可以获得数百个百分点的回报。所以，很明显他因为错过了而感到恼火。客观地说，你就是错过了。两年后，你不能一直说同样的话，除非我们回到标普3650点。那可能吗？当然。但当你看到盈利增长时，那就不合理了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, the guy is probably annoyed that he missed it and I know he's had some trades with Estee Lauder and Baba etc. But if you had just leaned in to America and you know Burry's not a horrible stock picker if you had picked a couple of the Mag 7s he would have been up multiple hundreds of percent. So it's like obviously he's annoyed that he missed it and it's like objectively you missed it. It's like you missed it, right? like after two years you can't keep saying it unless we go back to 3650 on the S&P and is that possible? Sure. But then when you look at the earnings growth that would not make any sense, right?</p>
</details>

所以，从根本上说，当你说要卖出时，你没有预料到你会看到这样的盈利增长。你没有预料到AI革命，没有预料到我们会看到的资本支出建设。仅仅说过去两年半的一切都是纯粹的泡沫，这没有多大意义。所以我认为他显然很恼火，很生气，结果他现在试图通过告诉大家“嘿，是时候卖出了，你应该害怕市场正在发生的事情”来表达他的挫败感。我认为这是一个看涨信号，因为你需要人们感到害怕和担忧，才能获得真正推动我们走高的那种动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like at its core when you said to sell you didn't anticipate the type of earnings growth you would see. You didn't anticipate the type of AI revolution, the capex buildout we would see. Just to say all of that over the past two and a half years was pure bubble. I mean it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so I think he's obviously annoyed. He's angry and as a result he's now trying to voice that frustration by telling everybody, hey, it's time to sell and you should be scared of what's going on in the market. I think this is a bullish signal because again, you need people to be afraid and worried in order to get that type of momentum that really takes us higher.</p>

### 黄仁勋在韩国：巩固合作与市场信号

让我们来谈谈黄仁勋。我将要展示的视频可能会显得有些“见顶”的迹象，但你必须记住，这是黄仁勋，他可以做他想做的事，因为他是黄仁勋。首先，这是黄仁勋与三星和现代的CEO一起喝交杯酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about Jensen. So, the videos I'm about to show you are going to scream toppy, but you just have to remember it's freaking Jensen and he gets to do what he wants because he's Jensen. So, let's start off with a couple of these videos. First of all, this is Jensen with the CEO of Samsung and Hyundai doing shots while locking each other's arms.</p>
</details>

接下来这个视频是黄仁勋在韩国与一群人交谈，问他们是否是英伟达的投资者。然后，这群人展示了他们手机上的英伟达股价作为回应。你可以看出黄仁勋玩得很开心。人群中的人待他如摇滚明星，拿出手机展示英伟达的股价。黄仁勋则说：“哇，看那个，看那个股票在涨。”这确实感觉有点见顶，但无论如何，英伟达一直在实现增长。我认为黄仁勋理应享受这一刻的荣耀和乐趣，因为他让人们变得非常富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The next video right here is, well, take a look at this. You got Jensen in Korea talking to a crowd of people saying, "Is anyone investors?" And then that same crowd responded by showing off their phones with Nvidia stock price. You could tell Jensen's having such a good time. Like people in a crowd are treating him like a rockstar. They're pulling up their phone to show their stock prices of Nvidia. And Jensen's like, "Wow, look at that. Look at that. Look at the stock. Look what it's doing." I mean, obviously it feels kind of toppy, but nonetheless, Nvidia has been putting up the growth. And I think Jensen deserves to be able to bask in the glory of this moment and have this much fun because he's made people filthy rich.</p>
</details>

如果有人不了解韩国，我是在过去几个月才发现的，韩国在投资方面是最大的国家之一，尤其是在期权交易和“Degen”投资（指高风险、高投机的投资行为）这两方面。韩国的社区会聚集起来押注某只股票，这种情况在过去十年里发生在多家公司身上，并且还在加速。英伟达就是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one thing if people don't know about South Korea, and I found this out actually over the past couple months, South Korea is one of the biggest countries when it comes to not only investing, but when it comes to two things, option trading and DGEN investing. When I mean DGEN investing, I mean communities that form in South Korea that come together to be able to bet on a stock has happened for various companies over the past really decade and it's only accelerating. Nvidia being one of them.</p>
</details>

那么，他为什么在韩国呢？嗯，他在签署一些协议，并与韩国媒体交谈，继续论证为什么英伟达应该处于现在的位置。他正在与SK海力士和三星达成一些交易。当被问及是否会将Blackwell芯片销往中国时，他是这样回答的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why is he in South Korea? Well, he's signing some deals and he's talking to the media in South Korea and, you know, continuing to make the argument for why Nvidia deserves to be at the spot that it is. He's making a couple of deals with SK Hynix and Samsung. Here's what he was answering when he was asked about Blackwell going to China.</p>
</details>

“我不知道，希望有一天可以。我认为英伟达能够参与中国市场对美国和中国都非常有益，但目前还没有做出任何决定，我们会看看结果如何。我希望结果是好的。本周，我们宣布将在韩国再建25万个GPU，使韩国成为世界上最大的GPU或AI基础设施国家之一。我们将与三星合作建设5万个GPU AI工厂。与SK集团合作，当然是使用HBM内存，但也在创建他们工厂的数字孪生。我们还将与SK集团为他们的AI工厂建设5万个GPU AI工厂。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I don't know. I hope so someday. I think it's really good for America and it's really good for China that Nvidia could participate in the Chinese market, but no decisions have been made and we'll see how it turns out. I hope it turns out well. This week, we announced that we will build 250,000 more GPUs here in Korea, making Korea one of the largest GPU or AI infrastructure countries in the world. And we're going to build 50,000 GPU AI factories with Samsung. Working with SK, the SK group, of course, with HBM memory, but also in creating digital twins of their factories. and we're going to build 50,000 GPU AI factories with SK group for their AI factories."</p>
</details>

总的来说，交易概括如下：英伟达将出货26万个GPU。三星将为其新的AI工厂获得5万个GPU，SK集团5万个，Navercloud 5万个。三星已经为其生产所有英伟达的机器人处理器。所以他去韩国是为了真正巩固这些交易。看起来这次旅行是成功的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the overall deal is summarized right here. Nvidia will ship 260,000 GPUs. Samsung will get 50,000 GPUs for its new AI factory. SK Group 50,000 then Navercloud 50,000. Samsung already manufactures all of its Nvidia's robotics processor. So the reason he went to South Korea was to really solidify these deals. And it looks like this was a successful trip.</p>

### 市场开盘与个股动态

好了，我们来谈谈开盘情况。亚马逊股价249.44美元，跌破了250美元，但仍保持了11%的涨幅，这已经很不错了。Palantir呢？我们到200美元了吗？我们到了！女士们先生们，Palantir，恭喜！每股200美元。开盘时达到200.30美元。Robin Hood上涨5%，英伟达上涨2%，特斯拉上涨2%，SoFi上涨2%，AMD上涨2%，标普指数上涨1%。

<p class="english-text">All right, wake your ass up. Amazon 249.44, loses 250, but holding on to an 11% move, which you can't be too upset about. There you go. Amazon right there. 11.7% up on the day. Palantir, do we get 200? We got 200. We got 200, folks. We might as well do it right now. Ladies and gentlemen, Palantir, congratulations. $200 a share. Palantir gets 200. 200.30 at the opening bell. Robin Hood up 5%. Nvidia up two. Tesla up two. SoFi up two, AMD up two, S&P's up one.</p>
</details>

Reddit也表现出色。Reddit的财报很奇怪。有一个关于Tanner的搞笑视频，如果你看了他的直播，Tanner第一次做了财报交易。他从不做财报交易。他买入了Reddit，然后股票飞涨，接着又跌回来，他开始道歉。然后股票又涨回去了，他说：“去你们的，我本来就是对的！”那情绪的过山车真是太搞笑了。但Reddit配得上这样的表现，他们正在飞速增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reddit crushed it as well. So, Reddit was weird. There was a hilarious video of Tanner. If you were watching Tanner stream, Tanner for the first time did a earnings trade and I know Tanner pretty well. He never does earnings trades. He took the trade and then the stock goes to the moon. Then it goes all the way back down and he starts apologizing. He's like, "Guys, this is why I don't do earnings trades. Don't follow me. I'm a horrible person." And then the stock shoots back up and he's like, "Screw you guys. I was right. I knew Reddit would go up." And it was the funniest thing ever. But it was great to see the roller coaster of emotions from Mr. Tanner on Reddit. Reddit deserves it. These guys are crushing it. These when you talk about a growth company, these guys are freaking growing.</p>
</details>

同比增长68%，毛利率91%，调整后EBITDA盈利，利润率40%。经营现金流1.85亿美元。日活跃独立用户同比增长20%，达到1.16亿。看，我从来都不喜欢Reddit的估值，尤其是当它涨到100多美元时。但我必须承认，他们有能力增长，而且看起来没有放缓的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's pretty incredible to see. 68% year-over-year growth. Gross margins at 91%. Profitable adjusted EBITDA has a 40% margin. Operating cash flow 185 million. Daily active uniques up 20% year-over-year to 116 million. I mean, look, I never love the valuation of Reddit, especially when it started getting into the high 100s and I kind of forgot about it. But they are able to grow and it doesn't look like they're slowing down.</p>
</details>

Coinbase的财报也很好，营收和利润都超出了预期。但电话会议结束时发生了一件事，布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗说：“我有点分心，因为我正在追踪关于Coinbase下次财报电话会议会说什么的预测市场。我想在这里加上‘比特币、以太坊、区块链质押和Web3’这些词，确保在电话会议结束前把它们都说出来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coinbase also crushed on earnings, but they beat on the top and the bottom. Incredible revenue numbers. Guidance was good. Subscription revenue was good. I mean, Coinbase really did crush it. And the headline on Coinbase though was this that happened at the end of the call. "I was a little distracted because I was tracking the prediction market about what Coinbase will say on their next earnings call and I just want to you know add here the words Bitcoin, Ethereum, blockchain staking and web 3 to make sure we get those in before the end of the call."</p>
</details>

看，我认为布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗很了不起，我真心觉得他只是在开玩笑。但他这样做，人们就会开始产生各种阴谋论。这也显示了赌博文化已经多么深入地渗透到我们的生活中。坦率地说，我认为他这么做的原因是因为Coinbase可能会推出预测市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so look, I think Brian Armstrong is incredible and I genuinely think he was in the earnings call and someone in the Slack probably sent the link of the prediction marketplace for what will Brian Armstrong say and he just had fun with it and he really wasn't like thinking that deeply about it. But dude, that is sus. That is so like the obvious thing people think about is who does he know that has trades. It goes to show how deep the gambling culture has infiltrated our lives. And quite frankly, I think the reason Brian Armstrong did that is because, and I heard this rumor a month ago, and I don't know if it's going to happen, but I feel like Coinbase is going to launch prediction markets.</p>

### 经济展望与投资策略

关于经济，我们今天得到了一些数据。芝加哥**PMI**（Purchasing Managers' Index: 采购经理人指数，衡量制造业活动）为43.8，高于预期的42.3。这比上个月的40.6有所改善，是自今年7月以来的最好水平。但不利的一面是，这已经是连续第23个月处于收缩区间（即低于50）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, do we have PMI? We do have PMI Chicago PMI 43.8 versus 40.6. The estimate was 42.3. So, we got a beat on PMI. Chicago's October read on PMI comes in better than expected, 43.8. We're expecting a number closer to 42 and a half. There's good and there's bad. This is the best since well, July of this year, but that's still an improvement, sequentially higher than our final read last month at 40.6. Here's the fly in the ointment. This is the 23rd consecutive month in contraction territory, meaning under 50.</p>
</details>

摩根士丹利的迈克·威尔逊最近在一个播客中分享了一些有趣的观点。他认为标普500上涨有两个原因。首先，市场某些领域的增长非常好。其次，也是让很多人感到困惑的一点，股票基本上是一种通胀对冲工具。投资者现在比过去几十年来更担心通胀，所以他们涌向黄金、比特币，以及高质量的股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the first thing he said that was pretty interesting around how he thinks about why the S&P 500 is going up in comparison to inflation. Second reason which is the one that people's heads explode on is that stocks are basically an inflation hedge. Okay, particularly high quality stocks. S&P 500 being best case in point, NASDAQ even more so. Gold as you know has gone through the roof. Okay, Bitcoin has also done extremely well. Why is that happening? Because investors are more worried about inflation today than they have been in most of our careers going back to the 70s.</p>
</details>

他还预测，2026年的**EPS**（每股收益）增长可能接近20%，远高于市场目前预测的13-14%。他的理由是，我们正处于一个新的经济周期，许多公司在过去三年里盈利不佳，现在变得非常精简高效。随着经济复苏和温和通胀（这对盈利有利），这些公司将展现出强大的经营杠杆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the market is looking forward to next year and saying, "Hey, the Fed's going to be cutting. Earnings are actually going to be probably better than people think if we're in a new economic recovery." And so it's pricing in better earnings growth than what the market is modeling today, which is 13 14%. I think it could be something closer to 20, which is one reason why multiples maybe aren't as expensive as people think. These companies are really really lean and they're going to stay lean because maybe they're using things like AI or other efficiencies. And if we get a new economic cycle and we get inflation which by the way is good for earnings. I think if we don't get inflation next year, there's no chance of getting 20% earnings growth. I think we are going to have inflation next year in the right places.</p>
</details>

关于投资策略，有人问我是否会卖掉亚马逊。我不会。我认为亚马逊可以成为投资组合的基石，你不用太担心它。我们过去两个月做了足够的研究，意识到只要它下跌，就是买入的机会，然后长期持有。如果他们的利润率能提高到20%，营业收入达到2000亿美元，公司估值可能会接近4到5万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Would you sell Amazon? No, I would not sell Amazon at least. Look, here's my thing. Could Amazon go back down to like 220, 230? Yes. But I do think Amazon can become a cornerstone of a portfolio where you don't have to be too worried about it. And I think we've done enough work in terms of analyzing the company over the past two months to realize this is a dip buy if it ever gives you a dip and you just kind of hold on to it over the next 10 years as Amazon continues to become the behemoth that it is. And from a numbers perspective again if they can increase their margins to 20% they have 200 billion in operating income. You know you likely have closer to $4-5 trillion company.</p>
</details>

当然，考虑到市场的现实情况，适度获利了结也是一种对冲。我还没完全决定年底前要做什么，但我想增加一些现金储备。这总是一件健康的事情，因为你可能会遇到下跌，需要现金来买入。我可能会对一些头寸进行税损收割，并考虑是否在英伟达和Hood上减持一些。这是一个个人决定，但如果你对某个头寸过于集中，卖掉一部分来锁定利润也并非坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The best way to hedge against that as well is to take some profits like it's not that crazy to take some profits and I haven't fully come to the conclusion of what I want to do by the end of the year because I would like to raise some cash. I think that's a healthy thing to do regardless of the market cycle. also because, you know, you're likely going to get some dips and you want to have some cash to buy those dips. And so, you know, towards the end of the year, I'm definitely going to have to tax loss harvest some stuff. But also, I have to ask myself like, hey, like, do I take some profits across these names? And Palantir is the one company I really don't want to touch. So, then the other two candidates that are left are Nvidia and Hood. And I've got to ask myself, do I take some off the table and do I wait in 2026 if we get a better opportunity? So, and I think that's normal. That's healthy.</p>
</details>

好了，各位，今天就到这里。我会在收盘时回来。恭喜大家，Palantir突破200美元，标普指数上涨0.5%。这是一个疯狂的星期五，10月31日。希望我们能以一个好的收尾结束。祝大家万圣节快乐！
