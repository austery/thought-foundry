### 帆船传奇的成功秘诀：庆祝、动力与风险

大家好，我是**挪威银行投资管理公司**（Norges Bank Investment Management: 负责管理挪威主权财富基金）的**首席运营官**（COO: Chief Operating Officer）尼古拉·唐根。今天我非常高兴能邀请到彼得·伯林。彼得·伯林是帆船界的传奇人物，他曾三次赢得**美洲杯帆船赛**（America's Cup: 历史悠久的国际帆船赛事）冠军，包括最近的一次，还赢得了无数世界锦标赛和奥运会冠军。可以说，他最近一直在主宰帆船界。欢迎彼得！

<p class="english-text">hi everyone I'm Nikolai tangan the COO of the Norwegian so wealth fund and today I'm really happy to welcome Peter Burling Peter Burling is uh well he's a legend in sailing and uh won three America's Cup victories including one recently uh loads of World Championships like like loads and loads and uh Olympic championships as well so you've been kind of dominating sailing lately so welcome P hey thanks for having me</p>
</details>

彼得感谢了邀请，并表示今天的计划是探讨我们商业和金融界能从真正的专业人士那里学到什么。首先，当你们获胜时，会庆祝成功吗？彼得肯定地回答，他认为绝对需要庆祝成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hey thanks for having me So the plan is to tease out what we uh in the business world and in the finance world can learn from from the real professionals so first of all um when you win do you celebrate success yeah yeah I think you definitely have to celebrate the success um</p>
</details>

他解释说，每一次胜利背后都付出了巨大的努力，这些努力是在比赛前积累起来的。他认为，即使结果不尽如人意，也应该庆祝一个里程碑的结束。他补充说，最近一次美洲杯的胜利确实非常值得庆祝。当被问及庆祝的具体方式时，彼得表示这取决于情况。通常在比赛结束后，队员们会非常疲惫，所以他们通常只是想和所有支持他们的人一起享受那一刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean with every Victory there's there's so much hard work that that goes behind that building up to the competition I think you've also got to celebrate the the end of a milestone even if it it doesn't quite go as well as as you would have liked um but yeah it was definitely um yeah the last America's Cup was a a really enjoyable one to celebrate for sure when you say celebrate what do you mean um I mean is like like a cup of tea and that's it or it really depends normally after a competition you're pretty tired so normally you're just trying to enjoy the moment with uh you know everyone that that's got you there</p>
</details>

在美洲杯这样的环境中，团队有200人，还有所有的朋友和家人，以及自己的家人。有太多的人在整个旅程中给予了支持，所以能够与大家分享那一刻非常美好。因为在实际的比赛阶段，大家通常都非常忙碌，没有太多时间真正与支持自己的人一起享受胜利。当被问及快乐能持续多久时，彼得认为“快乐”是一个很难量化的东西，但你确实能感受到成就感和自豪感。他觉得失败带来的痛苦总是比胜利带来的快乐持续更久。但无论如何，这都会推动你走向下一次冒险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for an America's Cup environment there's 200 people in the team there's all the friends and family um there's your own family yeah there's just so many people that have I suppos supported you along along that journey and you know it's really nice to be to share share a moment with everyone just because generally you end up so busy in the the actual competition phase that you don't get a lot of time to to really enjoy it with the people that have have supported you to be there how long are you happy for quite a while um happy is quite a hard thing to quantify right but yeah you really I suppose get that sense of accomplishment and pride of what you've managed to achieve I think the the losses always hurt a lot longer than the the wins are are happy make you happy for um but yeah either way I think it just fuels you forward into the next adventure</p>
</details>

### 持续动力的源泉：变化、决策与风险管理

是什么让你能长时间保持动力，你已经这样做了很多年了？彼得回答说，对他而言，关键在于“多样性”，以略微不同的方式做事。他认为他们很幸运，所从事的运动拥有令人难以置信的多样性，而且技术发展非常迅速。因此，他们需要定期克服不同的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think is a key to kind of keep yourself motivated for for such a long a time you've done it now for many years right well for me it's variety it's it's doing things slightly differently I think we're really lucky we're in a sport where there's an incredible amount of varieties and also the technolog is evolving very quickly so you have um you know different challenges you have to overcome on a regular basis</p>
</details>

帆船运动是一种非常独特的运动，它非常注重决策。你不可能做出所有正确的决定，关键在于比别人多做一两个正确的决定，并利用机会，在可能获得潜在收益时承担一些风险。但同时也要知道何时止损。这就是为什么他喜欢将投资与帆船运动进行比较的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know sailing's a quite a unique sport where you know it's it's a very much a decision-making sport um you definitely do not get all the decisions correct it's all about you know making one or two more correct ones than someone else and leveraging yourself and taking a bit of risk when when you've got an opportunity to to make a potential gain but you're also knowing when to cut your loss which is why I like to compare investing with sailing</p>
</details>

他解释说，你可能一直领先，但风向一变，你就输了。这并不是你的错。在金融领域也是如此，你可能做得很好，但市场突然转向，你看起来就像个彻底的失败者。彼得补充说，在他们的运动中，有很多关于什么是保守、什么是激进的讨论。从传统意义上讲，对于水手来说，保守或激进是非常明显的。但当你将情景完全推演到最终状态时，有时很难判断某件事是否是传统上看起来非常激进，但实际上是你当时认为的“最后选择”，或者与另一艘船交战并采取保守选择，如果从长远来看，这实际上并不是一个保守的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because you could be you could be ahead and then the win changes and you are lost right and so you lose it's not because of you and it's the same in finance you know you are you're doing really well Market totally turns and you look like a complete loser yeah oh I mean in our sport is is so much of what is is actually conservative and what what is actually aggressive you know in a traditional sense it's very obvious to to a sailor what conservative or aggressive is but you know when you actually play scenarios fully out to an end State it's quite hard sometimes to tell whether something is um I suppose traditionally would have looked very aggressive but is actually what you think is the last wor option at the time or you know whether engaging with another boat and just kind of taking the conservative option is is not actually a conservative option if you looked at it over a a longer period</p>
</details>

因此，有很多关于你是想对抗对手，还是仅仅想控制比赛节奏的讨论。当被问及他是否是一个激进的水手时，彼得认为是的。他的心态非常明确，如果有机会，就一定要承担适当的风险，无论是如何驾驶船只。但话虽如此，作为一名水手，你希望在各个方面都技术过硬，不希望有任何弱点，这样你就可以利用“工具箱”中的所有工具，并选择你认为当时正确的选项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so yeah there's a lot of you know whether you're trying to play against an opposition or whether you're just almost trying to time trol your race or are you an aggressive sailor yeah I think so um yeah my mindset is very much if there's an opportunity to to make sure you take an appropriate amount of of risk with it you know whether it's how you're sailing the boat but you know in saying that I think you know as a sailor you want to be technically good uh across the board you don't want to have any any weaknesses so you can use uh all the tools in the toolbox for a very cliche cliche way of saying it and take you know what options you think are the correct ones at the time</p>
</details>

### 团队的超强实力与技术细节

本·安斯利（Ben Ainslie），你曾在美洲杯中击败过他，他说你的团队是帆船史上最棒的团队。你认为你们的超强实力是什么？彼得认为，在一项运动或一个企业中，你不会只有一项超强实力。在现在的体育界，每个人都非常优秀，每个人都表现出高水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now Ben anley who you beat in the America's Cup said um your team now is the best team sailing has ever seen what do you think is your super strength I think within a sport or a business you don't have one super strength in sport now everyone's very good um everyone performs at a very high level</p>
</details>

但关键在于确保你把所有的小事都做得非常出色，团队协作良好，与工程师合作顺畅，对设备了如指掌。目前的水平非常高，每个人都在努力，所以你总是在寻找这些微小的优势。如果你能在某个领域找到一两个微小的优势，你很快就能获得相当大的提升。所以，他们努力做的就是不断超越对手学习和改进。他认为，团队的定义更多在于改进的速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's making sure you do all the little things really well you come together as a group well you work um you're well with your engineers you know your equipment incredibly well and just the levels getting so high that that everyone's playing out at the moment that you're always trying to look for these little we gains that you know if you can find one or two little gains across a an area you very quickly get get quite a significant jump so you know that's what we try and do is think just trying to continue to out learn and out improve our opposition I don't think and I think the rate of improvement is is more where the the teams get defin</p>
</details>

你比英国队做得更好的一点是什么？或者只是很多方面都做得更好？彼得认为这很难说，因为他们并不真正了解英国队的内部运作。但那确实是一场大胜。他们对自己的设备以及如何驾驶它、如何处理船上的决策过程非常有信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what was the one thing you did better than the UK team or was it just lots of things uh I think it's incredibly hard to tell and I say that because we don't really know the the ins and outs of of their program but it was a pretty big beat very well yeah yeah we we felt like we were really confident with with our piece of equipment you know and how we we sailed that and how we dealt with the decision-making process around the boat</p>
</details>

美洲杯帆船赛的船只变得非常有趣，因为现在有一个巨大的盲点。所以你真的需要依靠船另一边的人来帮助你做出一些决定，并利用他们当时的视野，让你保持在正确的赛道上。彼得认为他们的船在这方面做得非常好，确保他们总是在赛道上做出好的决策，并且很好地分配了船上的负荷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the America scout boats have become very interesting because you have a huge blind spot now so you're kind of really relying on the people on the other side of the yacht to to help you make some of the decisions and to to utilize their View at at the time to to keep you in the correct part on the race course and you I think we did a really good job of that on our boat as is making sure we're always making good decisions around the race course and you know distributed the the load really well around the boat</p>
</details>

### 科技、模拟器与心理准备

现在的帆船运动变得非常技术化。彼得解释说，船只在复合材料方面变得极其技术化，它们可能是世界上承受最大压力的复合材料，因为他们正在将极限推得非常高。他们对这些材料进行了大量的监测，这样他们就可以推到极限，而且在航行时进行监测，回到岸上后也进行监测，以查看部件是否有任何退化的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's become very technical theing now yeah it's tell us about some of the kind of technicalities of it some data I mean it's the boats are getting incredibly technical on the composite side there'be the most strained kind of composits out there in the world because we're pushing the boundaries very high um we have a incredible amount of monitoring on those so we can push right up against the limit and you know also that that monitoring while you're sailing and then also the monitoring you know when you get back to shore to see if there's been any start of degradation on the on the components</p>
</details>

你可以回顾数据，查看任何事件的任何摄像机角度，并准确听到通讯中说了什么。这使得对话非常开放和透明，因为所有数据、所有通讯、所有音频都在那里，所以你可以很快弄清发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know you can pretty much go back in the data and look at whatever camera angle of whatever incident and hear exactly what was said on the comms um so it makes for this really kind of open transparent conversations because you know all the data is there all the comms all the audio is there so you can really get to the bottom of of whatever is going on pretty quickly</p>
</details>

当被问及作为驾驶员，他拥有的最酷的信息流是什么时，彼得认为人机界面非常有趣，并且已经发展了很长一段时间。你与船只互动的方式，无论是通过方向盘还是你使用的控制界面，以及这些数据如何通过屏幕反馈给你，这是一个不断快速发展的巨大循环。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's kind of the coolest information stream you have as a when you at you know Drive well I think your um human interfaces is really interesting and and has evolved a really long way um you know the way you interact with the boat um you know whether it's through the steering wheel or the the control surfaces you use and then how that data gets projected back to you through the screens is a massive Loop that continues to evolve very very quickly</p>
</details>

此外，现在你可以与岸上团队进行交互，通过让很多人观看实时数据，然后实际分析数据并给你更多尝试的东西，你可以大大缩短迭代周期时间。在比赛期间是否允许与他们沟通？彼得说，比赛期间不允许，这更多是在比赛准备阶段或训练日。一旦比赛开始，在比赛前3分钟，你就会被切断联系，进入自己的小“泡泡”中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know also the way that you know now you can interface back with the shaw you know you can really cut down your your iteration cycle Time by you know having a lot of people watching live data and then actually going over the data and giving you more things to try um are you allowed to communicate with them during the race not during the race but that's more in the race building up or on a training day once the race comes at 3 minutes to go from the race you're you're shut off and you're on your your own little bubble</p>
</details>

所以在那段时间里，你必须监控船上的许多系统，确保一切正常运行，并且没有对任何部件造成过载，因为船上有很多东西在大部分时间都处于峰值负荷的边缘。彼得表示这是一个非常有趣的领域。在完全投入帆船运动之前，他在奥克兰读了一半的工程学位，他真的很喜欢技术创新这一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you've got to I suppose monitor a lot of systems on the yacht at that time as well make sure that things are all working as as they should and that you um aren't overloading anything on the on the package because there's a lot of things in the boat that are sitting right up against the the peak loads a lot of the time so yeah I mean it's a really fun space I before I got fully into sailing um got halfway through an engineering degree in Oakland and and yeah I really love that Technology Innovation side</p>
</details>

当被问及他是否更喜欢技术而不是帆船运动时，彼得说他不会说更喜欢，但他认为努力从设备中获得最大效益，并能够根据情况不断发展和调整设备，是他非常喜欢的事情。他认为技术背景对他在美洲杯和帆船运动中肯定有很大的帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you like them more than the S do you like the tech more than the saing I wouldn't say more but I think trying to get the most out of a bit of equipment and being able to evolve and adapt that bit of equipment as you go is um something I really enjoy do you think the technology background has helped you and the America's Cup and and in sailing I think in general for sure it has a a really big benefit um</p>
</details>

在美洲杯中，这让他能够与工程师和设计师进行更好的对话，尽管他们在特定领域比他高出很多。仅仅是能够理解足够的基础原理，例如为什么某些东西会这样做，或者宏观结构在大局中是如何结合在一起的，他认为这非常有益。而且，当你在解决问题时试图对冲某一方时，对实际情况有更多的基本了解，他认为这确实非常积极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the America's Cup it's uh very much being able to have a lot better conversation with the engineers and the the design is orbe it they're at a much higher level than than I ever would be in a specific field just being able to understand enough I suppose base principle around you know why something's doing what it should be doing or how the global structures kind of in the big picture items are coming together I think is really beneficial um you know and then but also then when you're trying to hedge one side or another of a problem um you know just having a little more base understanding of of what is actually going on within that that uh situation is is I think really really positive</p>
</details>

他们会使用训练模拟器吗？彼得回答说，模拟器已经成为帆船运动领域的一个巨大工具，就像它在赛车运动领域一样。这不仅是为了设计船只，选择你在设备上想要做出的妥协（因为任何决定都有利有弊）。有时你可以在两方面都获得收益，但很多时候你都在努力弄清楚如何定位你的方案，相对于你猜测对手可能在哪里，或者你猜测天气预报可能是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you training simulators yeah the simulators become a huge Tool uh in in the world of sailing like it has in in the world of Motorsport not only for I suppose designing the boat choosing kind of what compromises you want to make on the equipment because there's always positives and negatives to to any decision um you know there there's times where you can take a gain on on both sides of the coin but you there's a lot of times where you're trying to figure out where you're trying to position your package relative to where you're guessing your opposition might be or whether you're where you're guessing the forecast might be</p>
</details>

最近，由于天气预报与传统上的五年平均水平相去甚远，这变得异常困难。但模拟已经成为一个巨大的工具，无论是在设计领域，确保你选择了一个好的概念，还是在用户输入设备的使用上获得肌肉记忆，以及在比赛方面获得足够的节奏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which has become incredibly hard of late with the I suppose forecasts becoming so far off what they traditionally would have been if you looked at a 5year average but yeah the simulation just become a massive tool both in the the design space being able to make sure you're you're picking a good good concept um you know also getting all your muscle memory around how you're using your user input devices and then you know when it comes to the racing side as well being able to get enough Cadence</p>
</details>

在模拟器上花费的时间因水上训练的负荷而异，但他们会尽量使模拟器尽可能接近现实。因为这对于练习比赛方面非常好，而且也意味着你可以设计一艘更快的船，因为你的模拟器实际上尽可能接近现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how much time do you spend in that simulator it it varies massively on how much load we're doing on the water at the same time but we try and make the simulator as close to reality as possible because it's um I suppose really good for for the practice racing side but then also it means that um you know you can design a faster boat because your your simulator is actually as close to reality as you can get it</p>
</details>

你是如何在赛前进行心理准备的？你是否有特定的方式，每次都做同样的事情？彼得说，他的迷信程度相对较低。如果看一个传统运动员，他真正喜欢做的一件事是确保他在参加大型赛事时，知道自己已经做好了最高水平的所有准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you prepare uh mentally before I race have you got a particular way of doing it do you do the same thing every time no probably relatively low on my Superstition Factor um if you looked at a traditional athlete um you know one thing I really like to do is make sure I come into a big event knowing that I've done all the the preparation to the the highest level I I could yeah um</p>
</details>

知道自己付出了努力，并最大限度地利用了比赛前的时间，以确保自己处于所需的状态，同时设备也准备就绪，并且对许多决策过程以及事情将如何展开感到非常适应。他认为，当你与人们谈论他们是否一直热切期待某场比赛几天，或者他们是否觉得比赛到来时他们才准备好时，这是一个有趣的对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">knowing that you've done hard work and you've really maximized the the time before the the competition to to make sure you in the the space you need to be but also your equipment and you're really comfortable with a lot of the decision- making processes how things are going to unfold yeah it's I mean it's an interesting conversation when you talk to people about you know whether the when it comes to a competition they've been eagerly awaiting that competition for a few days or whether they feel like they're just ready for the competition when the competition arrives um</p>
</details>

彼得说，他更倾向于在比赛的第一天就感觉自己已经准备好参加比赛。他通常会努力在比赛前和比赛期间不断进步。他们还与几位心理学家合作，确保在心理上处于正确的状态。他认为，在过去20年里，体育界在这方面取得了长足进步，确保并允许人们在比赛中保持更高的一致性，确保你拥有自己的“工具箱”中的工具，以确保你准备好出去竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you I'd say I'm more on the you know side of feeling like I'm ready for a competition on the first day of of the competition normally try and continue to be um trying to progress right up to that and right through the competitions yeah we've also done a lot of work with uh a few psychologists just trying to make sure you mentally get in the the right head space and I think it's uh one thing in sport that has come a long way in the last 20 years is making sure and allowing people to be a lot more consistent with their players making sure you kind of have tools within your own quiver to to make sure you you're ready to go out there and compete</p>
</details>

### 团队协作与成功合作的秘诀

谈到团队动力，你有一个搭档**布莱尔·图克**（Blair Tuke），你们已经一起航行了很长时间了，对吗？彼得确认了这一点，并表示他们从2009年就开始合作了，算起来已经15年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on to um uh Team Dynamics so you have a partner Blair juk you've been sing together for a long time right yeah yeah how long 2009 so yeah it's a we while ago now 15 years or something yeah um</p>
</details>

他们最初在**49er级帆船**（49er: 一种高性能双人帆船）上建立合作关系，然后又一起参加了**帆船大奖赛**（SailGP: 一项全球性的高速水翼帆船赛事）和美洲杯。所以他们合作得很顺利。在49er级帆船比赛中，你们长期以来一直是世界冠军，对吗？彼得确认了这一点。他们一起赢得了三枚奥运奖牌，其中两枚是银牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah we started our relationship in the the 49er um and then have sailed together on you know s GP and and also the America's Cup so yeah we get go long with and you were in the 49er you were like a consistently world champion over a long period of time yep um we won three Olympic medals together uh two two ended up being silver</p>
</details>

彼得回忆说，第一次获得银牌时，他们感觉自己正处于一个巨大的学习曲线中，从未真正追上击败他们的澳大利亚队，所以他们对那枚银牌非常满意。然后他们再次参赛，在四年周期内从未输过，赢得了里约奥运会冠军，并且以巨大的优势获胜，创造了纪录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the first one felt like uh yeah we were on this massive learning curve never really got to the Australians that that ended up beating us so we were really happy with that Silva and then went back the next time round and didn't lose for the the fouryear cycle can't remember how many events but quite a few on the TR and and one with a huge margin at the Olympics and then Rio in Rio and then obviously to how big was a Marin I think it was a record I can't I can't fully remember that's exactly right it was record what's it was comfortable</p>
</details>

长期成功合作的秘诀是什么？彼得认为，这在于发挥各自的优势。他和布莱尔是相当不同的人，但他们有很多相似的激情：他们都热爱户外运动，都非常有竞争力，并且经常有相同的目标。所以，他们理解你不可能做出所有正确的决定，但你们都在努力朝着同一个目标前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the secret behind a successful collaboration over such a long time oh I think playing to strengths a little bit um me and bl would be quite different people um but in saying that we've got a lot of similar passions we both love the outdoors we're both really competitive and we both often share the the same goal so you know just that understanding of you you know that you're never going to make um you know all the decisions right but you're both trying to head to the the same place</p>
</details>

这并不总是充满“幸福家庭”的氛围，你必须能够进行良好的讨论，有些人可能会称之为“轻微冲突”，但你必须能够进行那些健康的对话，讨论如何从现在的位置转移到一个更好的地方。他认为，这正是保持事物新鲜并推动你前进的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's not always uh you know full of happy families you've got to be able to have good discussions and some people might say this like minor conflict but you know you've got to be able to have those healthy conversations in terms of you know how to actually shift from where you are now to to to a better place and you know that's um something that you know I think really keeps keeps things fresh and and pushes you forward</p>
</details>

### 沟通、领导力与持续改进

你们两人之间分歧是什么样子的？彼得说，这相对被动，更多是围绕着讨论，提出关于为什么某件事应该或不应该奏效的理论。你会发脾气吗？彼得说他个人很平静。他认为在他们的运动中，如果太容易发脾气，你可能会失去很多分数，或者失去赢得比赛的机会。现在的差距非常小，你不能让这种情况发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how what does a disagreement look like between the two of you it's relatively passive but yeah just it's more around discussion as to you know coming up with theories as to why something should work or not do you lose your temper um no I'm pretty pretty calm as a person I think in our sport if you lose your temper too easily you can really throw away a lot of points which or throw away opportunities to to close out events uh the margins are so small now that you just can't really allow that to happen</p>
</details>

保持冷静的关键是什么？彼得说他不知道，他是在新西兰长大的，那里的一切都相对放松。你认为愤怒在管理中有其地位吗？彼得认为，有时你必须表现出沮丧，你必须让人们知道界限在哪里，但你也必须创造一个环境，让人们不害怕创新，不害怕尝试新事物，不害怕发展，不害怕承担风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what's the key to stay calm I don't know I think um you I've grown up in New Zealand where you know everything's relatively relaxed um do you think anger has a place in management at all I think you've got to show frustration at times you've definitely got to you know make sure you you let people know when you know where the boundaries are but you've also got to create an environment where people aren't afraid to to be Innovative to to try things to develop to take risk um</p>
</details>

所以他认为，任何事情都需要真正的平衡。你希望人们不害怕承担风险，你希望人们在犯错时主动承认，你希望真正创造一个让人们享受他们所做事情的环境。因为如果你享受你所做的事情，那么付出额外的努力以达到最高水平就会容易得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think with everything there's always a real balance you know you want people to not be afraid to to take risk you want people to put their hand up when they make mistakes and you want to really create that environment where people are really enjoying what they do because you know if you're enjoying what you do it's so much easier to put in the that extra bit of effort that you need to to perform at the highest level</p>
</details>

所以他认为环境是他们工作中非常重要的一部分，努力给予人们学习、成长、进步并看到自身发展的自由，这是极其重要的。但同时，努力以非常健康的方向推动团队发展也同样重要。所以他认为反馈循环如何运作非常重要，汇报工作如何进行也很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think you know environment is such a a big part of of what we do and you know trying to give people the freedom to to learn and grow and improve and see a progression in themselves it's something that's incredibly important but you know then obviously trying to push it in a in a really healthy direction for the the teams really important as well so yeah I think that part of you know how the feedback loop works is really important how the debriefing works</p>
</details>

你们是如何进行汇报的？彼得认为他们很幸运，有这些比赛时刻，你可以把你的牌亮出来，看看事情进展如何，然后从中学习。所以他们通常会进行汇报，确保从整个团队获得反馈。你们是立即进行一次全面的汇报，然后进行一次更大的汇报吗？彼得说，他们每天都会进行汇报，然后根据时间长短，定期或在活动结束后进行汇报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how do you how do you debrief I think we're really lucky that we have these moments where you get to compete and you get you know to put your cards on the table and see how things have performed and and then go back and learn from that so we generally would debrief we make sure we get feedback from the entire group you have a whole debrief straight away and then a bigger one or how do you how do you do it yeah we'd have a debrief after every day and then debrief either whether it's periodically or after events depending on how long it's been</p>
</details>

当你试图做出好的决策以向前迈进时，回顾一下过去总是非常有益的，并且不要害怕做出改变。同样重要的是，不仅要汇报失败，也要汇报胜利。他认为你总是可以通过了解哪些事情在胜利中做得非常好来学到很多东西，但即使在胜利中，也有很多事情你仍然想要改进和做得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you're trying to make some good decisions about where where you should go forward having a little look back is always a an incredibly healthy thing to do at that stage and not be afraid to to make change it's also making sure you debrief the wins just as much as the the losses I think you can always learn a lot by you know what things have have worked really well um in a wi but even in a wi there's also a lot of things that you still want to improve and get better on</p>
</details>

所以他认为大多数人对他们的审查过程和反馈循环不够一致，无法让人们改进和变得更好。尼古拉指出，体育运动中的这些反馈会议比商业和社会其他许多地方的会议更加诚实和透明。彼得同意，他认为在体育运动中，你没有太多可以隐藏的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know most people I don't think are consistent enough on their their review processes and their you know feedback loops as to how people can can improve and get better because it strike me that um these uh feedback sessions in sport are much more honest and transparent than they are in business and in many other places in society yeah yeah I think in sport you have a a lot less um Avenue to hide</p>
</details>

所以，如果你不完全诚实和透明，人们可以立即看出来。但同时，每个人都在努力争取相同的结果。所以，这就是他之前谈到的环境，你希望创造一个环境，让人们对某件事是否有效诚实，并且不害怕举手说出自己的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know if you're if you're not completely honest and transparent people can tell that's straight away but also everyone's there trying to to push for the same outcome so you've there what I was trying to talk about before with the environment you know you want to create an environment where people are you know honest about you know whether they think something's worked or not or and aren't afraid to put their hand up and and say something if they think it's not um</p>
</details>

他指出，如果你在一个小错误上兜圈子，而没有人承认，你可能会浪费大量时间。由此产生的效率低下是巨大的，而在体育运动中，时间永远是敌人。你通常会有一个硬性的比赛截止日期，你正在为此做准备。所以，时间是唯一你无法减慢的东西，它会不断前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know the amount of time you can waste going around in circles where someone's made a small mistake there and you haven't quite figured that out and they haven't put their hand up um you know the inefficiencies that can flow on from something like that are massive and you know time's always the the enemy you know in sport you've got a hard deadline of a competition normally that you're building up against so you know that time is the only thing you you can't slow down it kind of keeps marching</p>
</details>

所以，通过汇报过程以及人们的诚实和愿意在必要时突破界限，你可以获得多少效率？彼得认为，他在美洲杯中的主要职责之一是管理风险，理解许多重大的全球决策，以及这些决策导致他们无法比赛或训练的可能性，或者为了保持设备完好无损而必须做出的妥协。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know how much efficiency you can gain through the debriefing process and people being honest but also willing to I suppose push the boundaries enough and and put their head out at times to to take something on I definitely feel like one of my main roles within the America's Cup is really managing a bit of that risk profile and kind of understanding a lot of the the big Global decisions and How likely that is to to result in us not being able to do a race or not being able to do a training session or what compromises we're going to have to make to to keep a bit of equipment in one piece</p>
</details>

很多时候，这也与效率有关。所以，这种对过程而非结果的关注，你一直都是以过程为导向的吗？彼得回答说，他一直非常注重过程，但他要强调的一点是，在框架内你需要足够的灵活性来创造创新并持续改进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">p a lot of its efficiency related as well so this focus on process rather than uh results have you always uh being process oriented yeah I think I've always been very process orientated but um one thing I would say is you need enough flexibility within a framework um to be able to create Innovation and to continue to improve</p>
</details>

如果你过于注重过程，只是按部就班地执行，那么你最终会停滞不前，无法进步。你需要足够的结构，让人们知道他们应该在哪里，应该做什么任务，但你需要在这种结构中留出足够的空间，让他们能够成长、承担风险并尝试不同的事情，然后定期重建这个过程，使其仍然与你当时所做的事情相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">also if you get to process focused and just go through and D do do and that's you and off you go then you you end up quite stagnant and and it doesn't progress you need enough structure that people know where they should be what tasks they should be doing but you need enough space within that structure that they can grow and take risks and do different things and then to rebuild that that process on a regular enough basis that it's still relevant to what you're doing at the time</p>
</details>

他再次回到效率问题，认为当时你所做的过程对效率非常重要。即使你看看会议的数量，每个人在会议中是否都富有成效，人们是否只是为了说两句话而坐在会议中，浪费了一小时的时间，或者他们是否完全投入，并且这是一次向更广泛群体的信息传递。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you go back to an efficiency thing like the process you're doing at the time to on an efficiency thing is is so important and you know even if you look at the the amount of meetings you're having how productive everyone in that meeting is being at the time they're in the meeting whether people are sitting in a meeting to say you know two words and they've kind of wasted an hour of their day or whether they're kind of fully engaged and it's a um a download of information to a wider group</p>
</details>

在体育环境中，在一个赛季中有很多点可以让你在一天中节省大量时间，或者失去大量时间，而且不仅仅是针对一个人，而是针对更广泛的群体。这与商业中完全相同，如果你开会，你希望人们觉得他们可以走进会议，如果他们没有投入到会议中，他们可以不觉得有义务待在那里，而是去做其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it there's so many points in a in a campaign in a sporting environment where you can gain a lot of time in your day or you can lose a lot of time in your day and not just for one person for a wider Group which is I mean exactly the same business if you're having a meeting you you want people to feel like they can walk into the meeting and you know if they're not engaged in that meeting to be able to not feel obliged to be there and go ahead and do something else</p>
</details>

你从这种过程中的灵活性中获得的效率是如此关键。谈谈沟通吧，你们坐在船的两侧，所以你只能看到一半的赛道，对吗？所以你非常依赖与另一个人沟通。彼得说，在美洲杯中，他坐在右舷舵位，他是船长，然后他还有另一位舵手**内森·奥特里奇**（Nathan Outteridge）坐在左舷。然后他们有两位修帆手，**布莱尔·图克**坐在左舷，**盖伊·安迪**（Guy Endean）坐在右舷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the just the efficiencies you can derive from from that I suppose flexibility within a process is so key tell me about the communication so you sit on each side of of the sale right so you you you can only see half the course yep so you're pretty dependent on communicating with the other guy yeah so in the americ cup you I sat on the the starbard helmet the I supp Skipper of our boat and then I had another Helmsman on the the port side Nathan outage who sat on the other side and then we had um two trimmers essentially sitting in front of both me and Nathan so Blair set on the the port side and Guy Andy sat on the starbard side um</p>
</details>

但在某些时候，你可能看不清太多，或者你正在非常努力地集中精力让船快速前进。良好沟通的关键是什么？彼得说，在游艇上，他们都通过耳机通话，所以声音非常大。他们戴着耳罩，麦克风就在脸前。他们会尽量像平时说话一样，用正常的音量说话，这样你可以更快地说出事情，而不是大喊大叫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but yeah at certain times you can't see very much that way or you're concentrating very hard on keeping the boat going fast so what's the key what's the key to good communication well on the yacht we we all talk through a headset so it's very loud so you have your MFS on and you have your your microphone right in front of you face for us we try and talk it like we're talking here normal volume and you can say things so much quicker uh if you're talking at a normal volume rather than having to yell um</p>
</details>

但要非常注意你在沟通循环中的措辞，这非常重要。确保你有办法非常快速地传递信息，这样你就不会堵塞通讯循环，因为基本上在那个通讯循环中一次只能有一个人说话。并且知道谁应该在什么时候提供什么信息也非常关键，这样你就能期待从某个声音那里听到某些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but yeah being very careful of I suppose your phrasing in our communication Loop's really important making sure you have ways of getting information across very quickly so you don't clog up the the coms Loop because essentially only one person can talk at a time on that that cons Loop and knowing kind of who should be feeding in what information at what time so you're expecting to hear something from a certain voice is very key as well</p>
</details>

你之前告诉我，即使你领先500米或落后500米，你的声音和语调都无法分辨出差异。彼得说，你通常不应该能够真正分辨出来。他们通常会有一些检查和平衡机制。如果有很多行动正在进行，或者情况非常繁忙，或者在某个特定时间对应该做什么存在一些犹豫，事情变得有点紧张，那么有一个很好的方法可以将事情恢复到应有的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you told me before that um you know even if you are 500 M ahead or 500 me behind you cannot discern the difference in your voice and your level yeah you shouldn't be able to really tell normally we'd have a few checks and balances within that if if say there's um a lot of action going on or it's a kind of very busy thing or there's kind of some indecision around what exactly we should be doing at a certain time and things are getting a little but heightened like having a good way of bringing things back down to the level they should be</p>
</details>

通常对他们来说，紧张和安静的范围非常小，远小于大多数人所能承受的范围。但你足够了解人们，并与他们一起比赛足够多，你就会知道他们是否处于良好的状态，或者他们是否在某种情况下感到有点紧张。这就是体育的乐趣，你可以去与世界上最优秀的人竞争，看看你到底有多优秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">generally for us you know heightened to not but quiet is uh the very small band compared to what most people would operate with him um but you get to know people well enough and you compete with them enough that you know that you know whether they're working in a good good window or they're you know feeling a bit of a bit of tension in a in a scenario or I mean that's the joy of sport you get to go and compete against the best people in the world and you know see how how good you really are</p>
</details>

你绝对无处可藏，因为一切都在广播中，有那么多摄像机角度，有那么多数据，你必须真正全力以赴，并接受评判。你提到你们团队有200人，管理200人的关键是什么？彼得说，他个人很喜欢相对……（主持人打断）。船上有多少人？船上有八个人：两名驾驶员，两名修帆手和四名与动力相关的角色，基本上是骑自行车的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you've got absolutely nowhere to hide because everything's on the broadcast is so many camera angles there's so much data out there that you've got to really go out there and put your best foot forward and and be judged from that you mentioned there were 200 people on your team what's the what's the key to be a good manager of 200 people well personally I quite like a relative so I'm sorry just get right so on board the boat you are how many on board the boat we're eight yeah four uh two two drivers two drivers two trimmers and four um power related roles yeah basically biking right</p>
</details>

在美洲杯中，所有人都骑自行车。然后你当然还有两边的替补队员。所以与动力相关的人员会轮换，因为他们的强度非常大，需要达到很高的水平。然后他们在设计团队中有很多人员，你也可以在训练时直接与他们沟通。你还有追逐船上的人员，安全人员，造船人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so nor America's couple was um all biking and then you have obviously your reserves on both sides so the the power related guys end up rolling through I suppose people just because it's it's very intensive on the other level they've got a got a perform at and then we have in the Design Group um you have a lot of people there you can also communicate directly to them when you're training um you have people on the chase boat you have your safety people you have your boat Builders</p>
</details>

有大量的项目正在进行，他认为拥有一个非常好的结构非常重要，在这个结构中，有很多人承担着很多责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you have a massive amount of of projects going on and I think having you know a really good structure within that where you have you know a lot of you know people taking a lot of responsibilities really important</p>

### 新西兰的帆船文化与海洋保护

你六岁就开始帆船运动了，对吗？彼得说，那确实是很久以前的事了。他是在新西兰长大的，所以从小就在水边长大。他的父亲年轻时也曾航行过，后来停止了，然后让他的哥哥也参与进来。所以他一开始是被拖着去的，后来觉得去尝试一下比坐在沙滩上更有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you began sailing when you were six right yeah it was a little while ago now um but yeah I grew up in New Zealand so grew up in and around the water and actually my dad had sailed when he was younger and kind of stopped sailing and got my brother into it so I was getting dragged along to start with and then decided to be more fun to go and give it a go than sit on the beach um</p>
</details>

他认为他们在新西兰非常幸运，因为他们的国家大部分被水环绕，很多人都住在海岸附近。气候通常很温暖，特别是与挪威这样的地方相比，那里一年中大部分时间都无法航行。但在新西兰，你可以全年航行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you I think we're very Lucky in New Zealand that so much of our our nation surrounded by water um and so many people live so close to the coast it's a generally pretty warm climate especially if you compared it to somewhere like Norway where you know a lot of the year you couldn't actually go on sale you know New Zealand you could sail all year round</p>
</details>

作为年轻人，能够出去，对你的船做出一些决定，并与其他人比赛，他觉得这非常有趣，这是一段奇妙的旅程。在新西兰长大，你必须选择是玩帆船还是橄榄球？彼得说，是的，或者现在足球也变得非常流行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah something as a young guy getting out there um and kind of making some decisions with what to do with your boat and um getting to race against some other people was I found really good fun and it's been been an amazing journey so when you grow up in New Zealand you have to kind of juice I'm either going to do sailing or rugby is uh yeah or um soccer football as um getting incredibly popular now as well</p>
</details>

你认为新西兰在帆船运动中取得成功的原因是什么？彼得认为，如果人们知道答案，那将很容易模仿。但他认为，作为一个国家，他们是相对具有创新精神的人，他们与水有着非常好的亲和力。大多数人在成长过程中都有许多与水相关的美好回忆，并且热爱在水边或水中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh what do you think explains New Zealand's success in sailing I think if people knew it would be easy to emulate but yeah I think we've um you know as a nation we're relatively Innovative people um and we just have a really good AFF Affinity with the water most people have I mean so many fond memories with the water when they they grow up and just love being in and around the water</p>
</details>

他认为这导致了他们国家高水平的帆船运动，而且在他记忆中一直如此。他认为成功在很多方面会孕育成功。他们拥有一个优秀的团队，可以向他们提问，获得建议。你们会和橄榄球队交流吗？彼得说他们确实花了一些时间与他们在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that you know I think that's just LED through to a really high level of um sailing in our country and for as long as I can remember it's just always been that way I think you know success breeds success in a lot of ways as well you know we've got a an amazing pool of people to be able to ask questions to get advice from do you um do you compare notes with um with the r team we spent a little bit of time with them actually</p>
</details>

你们从彼此身上学到了什么？彼得认为，这两种运动既非常不同又非常相似。**全黑队**（All Blacks: 新西兰国家橄榄球队）在如此长的时间内取得了如此高的胜率，并不断建立这些系统和韧性，不断发展自己作为一个橄榄球队，做得非常出色。看到他们如何拥有自己的节奏和流程，但他们似乎总是能保持在超高水平，这非常令人惊叹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you learn from each other yeah I think the sports are incredibly different and incred be similar at the same time and the old blacks have done an incredible job getting such a high um winning percentage over such a long period of time and just continued to build those those systems and resilience and continue to evolve themselves as a as a rugby team and you know it's been pretty amazing to to see how they they have their their RS and their flows but they always seem to continue to perform at that that super high level</p>
</details>

相似之处在于，看到决策过程如何运作，确保所有运动员都真正被赋予权力，最大限度地发挥自己的潜力，然后以非常高的水平融入团队。他们如何招募人员，以及他们如何在团队内部建立韧性。你们在帆船前也会跳**哈卡舞**（Haka: 新西兰毛利人的传统战舞，常在新西兰橄榄球队比赛前表演）吗？彼得说，老实说，他不太擅长哈卡舞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what are the similarities just seeing how the decision- making process works um you know making sure all the athletes are you know really empowered to to get the most out of them elv but then you also feed into the team at a a really high level you how they onboard people um you how they build resilience within their their group do you also do the hacker before sailing I'm not too good at the hacker to be honest</p>
</details>

他更喜欢在一天中放松下来。他是一个非常低调的人，他发现仅仅是比赛的肾上腺素，你需要稍微提高一点，找到一个适合自己的好水平，但哈卡舞对他来说会有点太激烈了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I'm more try and relax into my day I'm pretty low-key person so I find that just with the adrenaline of an event and you know you've got to go up a little bit and find a good level for yourself but yeah it'll be a bit too intense for me</p>
</details>

你有一个不放松的地方，那就是你对气候和海洋状况的看法。你和布莱尔在不久前共同创立了**Live Ocean**（Live Ocean: 彼得·伯林和布莱尔·图克创立的海洋保护慈善机构）。Live Ocean是什么？彼得解释说，Live Ocean是他和布莱尔在新西兰五年前创立的一个海洋保护慈善机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one place where you where you're not relaxed is your view on on the climate and and the state of the ocean so you started live ocean with Blair a little while back and so what tell us what what is live ocean yeah live ocean is a marine conservation charity that Blair and myself founded uh in New Zealand 5 years ago now</p>
</details>

回顾那段时间发生了多少事情，真是令人惊叹。新西兰拥有世界第四大海洋空间。海洋是连接各国的东西，它是世界的“散热器”，它吸收了90%的热量，在氧气生产方面做了大量繁重的工作。如果你开始谈论生物多样性，海洋确实是地球上许多生物多样性存在的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">amazing looking back how much has happened during that time and New Zealand have the the fourth largest ocean space in the world and I mean the oceans the thing that connects Nations um you know it's really the the heat sink of the the world um you know it absorbs 90% of the Heat does so much of the heavy lifting with you know oxygen production you know if you start talking about biodiversity you know the ocean really where a lot of that is left on the planet we live on</p>
</details>

他认为海洋是他们比赛的如此美妙的地方，他们觉得他们真的必须尽自己的一份力量来保护它。通常你会等到职业生涯结束，不再那么忙碌时才承担这样的任务，但当他们开始与该地区的科学界交流时，他们觉得问题太紧迫了，不能再等了。现在这是一段非常酷的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean it's such an amazing thing that that we race on that we felt like we were really you know had to to do our pce to protect it and you know normally you'd wait till the end of your career when you weren't too busy to to take that on but you know when we went and started talking to the science community in the area it felt like the issues were were too urgent to to wait and now it's been a really cool Journey</p>
</details>

这个基金会做什么？基金会支持有前景的科学研究，并帮助加速其发展，并继续推广宣传。他们最初从一个关于**信天翁**（Albatross: 一种大型海鸟，常被视为海洋健康的指示物种）的项目开始。彼得回忆说，他在2017年参加了一次环球帆船赛，当他们在南大洋航行时，你感觉自己完全力不从心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what does the foundation do the foundation takes promising science uh and you know helps accelerate that um you know and continues to promote the Outreach so we we started off with a a project around Albatross actually um which you know sailed around the world in an ocean race in in 2017 and you know when we're sailing through the Southern Ocean you feel pretty out of your depth you know</p>
</details>

你在一艘小船上，在绝对荒无人烟的地方，那里的天气系统非常强大，而这些信天翁只是在周围盘旋，几乎是在打量你，想知道你到底在那里做什么，但它们做得如此轻松。信天翁更多地代表了生物多样性，它们是“哨兵物种”，所以如果它们遇到困难，那么海洋也遇到了困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you're on the small boat in the middle of absolutely nowhere with the the weather systems down there are so powerful and there these Albatross just cruising around almost checking you out wondering what on Earth you're doing doing down there but they just do it so easily yeah the albatross Mor tell a biodiversity and and how much the that they are Sentinal species so if they're struggling then then the ocean's struggling</p>
</details>

他们选择追踪的物种是新西兰环境保护部在过去20年里一直在监测的。在这20年里，繁殖种群减少了70%。老实说，他们追踪的物种在陆地上没有捕食者，它们是**安提波德信天翁**（Antipodean albatrosses），生活在新西兰东南角250英里外的一个岛屿上，你需要许可证才能登陆，那里没有害虫。

<details>

</details>

这是一个非常孤立的地方，但这个物种仍然在急剧减少。所以，看到事情在没有你真正关注问题的情况下，以负面方式如此迅速地变化，真是令人担忧。尼古拉赞扬了他们所做的出色工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">it's a very isolated bit of bit of the world um but yeah still the species was absolutely freef falling so now it's um scary to see how how quickly things can be changing in a negative way unless you you really shine lot on the issues no there some really great work you do there um</p>
</details>

### 人生哲学与建议

你有什么特别的人生格言或口号吗？彼得说这些都是难题。他认为他没有特别的格言，但他喜欢高效利用时间，从不害怕接受挑战，从不害怕展示自己，只是为了不断学习和进步。他觉得你总能从别人那里学到很多东西，你可以吸收并变得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">any particular motto or slogan you live by these are tough questions um no I I don't think I have a particular I suppose motto that I live by but like to be relatively efficient with my time I like to never be afraid to to take on a challenge um never be afraid to to put myself out there just to continue to to learn and improve I feel like you've always got so much uh you can learn from people you can absorb and you can get better so yeah for me that's that's really the The Challenge and you know I'm really really enjoying it</p>
</details>

所以对他来说，这确实是挑战，他非常享受。如果你要给其他年轻人一些建议，他最喜欢的建议是确保人们真正享受他们所做的事情。他觉得生命并不是特别漫长，你必须真正对你所做的事情充满热情并享受它，特别是如果你真的想在这个领域取得领先和卓越。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if you were to give advice to other young people my favorite bit of advice is to make sure people really enjoy what they do um you I feel like life isn't massively long and you've got to really you know be passionate about what you're doing and enjoy it especially if you're really trying to get ahead and Excel in that field</p>
</details>

因为在某种程度上，一切都需要努力工作，如果你真正享受你所做的事情，那么付出额外的几个小时，或者做那个额外的小项目，或者其他零碎的事情，以真正取得领先并推动该领域向前发展，就会容易得多。尼古拉最后说，彼得，生命可能不长，但你迄今为止所取得的成就比大多数人一生中十辈子所做的还要多，而且你显然乐在其中。非常感谢你的到来。彼得回应说，非常棒，谢谢邀请。
