### 引言：卢梭与《论人类不平等的起源与基础》

Philosophy with SuperY, it makes you feel great! Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker.
This month, June 28th, is Rousseau's birthday. Coincidentally, Linking Publishing is reprinting Rousseau's classic work for its 50th anniversary, "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men."
In today's video, we'll introduce Rousseau's philosophical ideas.

哲学爽歪歪，让你爽歪歪！每一集都会为你介绍一位哲学思想家。
本月6月28日是**卢梭** (Jean-Jacques Rousseau: 18世纪瑞士哲学家) 的生日。巧合的是，联经出版社在50周年之际，正在重印卢梭的经典著作《**论人类不平等的起源与基础**》(Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men: 卢梭关于社会契约论和人类发展阶段的重要哲学著作)。
在今天的视频中，我们将介绍卢梭的哲学思想。

### 卢梭的生平与思想背景

In 1712, Rousseau was born in Geneva, which is now Switzerland. He is actually a Swiss philosopher, not a French philosopher.
He grew up in the rural areas of the Alps and loved the classics of ancient Greece and Rome.
Unlike other philosophers, he did not grow up within the system. He didn't receive any formal philosophical education; he was entirely self-taught. You could say he was a philosophical prodigy.
At the age of 15, Rousseau apprenticed to an engraver. One day, he came home too late, and the city gates were already closed.
If he went back the next day and was discovered, he would be punished by his master. So Rousseau simply didn't go home and wandered penniless to other places.
A few days later, he met a woman named Warens who took him in. She sent him to church for formal education and converted him to Catholicism.
Rousseau mentioned in "Confessions" that he was sexually harassed by members of the Catholic Church when he was 16. Someone tried to seduce young Rousseau.
He went to complain, but he was told that he was just a child talking nonsense. As a result, his experience in the church was not very good.
Later, Rousseau went to Paris to find Ms. Warens, and the two lived together and fell in love over time.
Because Rousseau had musical talent, he worked as a music tutor in Paris and earned money by arranging music.
Because there was no university philosophy department before the 19th century, many philosophers earned money by working as private tutors.
Rousseau's musical talent allowed him to enter Parisian high society. He met Diderot, the central figure in philosophy at the time.
Diderot was writing the encyclopedia project. So he asked Rousseau to write the entry for music.
As a result, Diderot was imprisoned for publishing the statement that "innate ideas do not exist."
Because the Catholic Church believes that people are born with original sin and have God innately. These are all innate ideas. If you dare to challenge it, you are challenging the authority of the church.
When Rousseau visited Diderot in prison, he read in the newspaper that they were accepting submissions for a writing competition.
The topic was "Has the restoration of the sciences and arts contributed to the purification or to the corruption of morals?". Rousseau suddenly realized something when thinking about this topic.
So he wrote an article, arguing that the more advanced science and art are, the more degenerate human civilization becomes. As a result, he won first place and became famous throughout France.
Later, he participated in the writing competition again. This time the topic was "On the Origin of Inequality".
Rousseau's submission this time made him famous. He went from being a musician to a philosopher.
This book has become the most influential work in Europe. Many French Revolutionaries were inspired after reading this book, realizing that inequality is not destiny and that society can be changed.
In today's episode, we will introduce this important work by Rousseau, "Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men."

1712年，卢梭出生于日内瓦，也就是今天的瑞士，他实际上是一位瑞士哲学家，而非法国哲学家。
他在阿尔卑斯山的乡村长大，热爱古希腊和古罗马的经典著作。
与其他哲学家不同，他没有在体制内成长，没有接受过任何正规的哲学教育，完全是自学成才。可以说他是一位哲学神童。
15岁时，卢梭成为一名雕刻师的学徒。一天，他回家太晚，城门已经关闭。
如果他第二天回去被发现，就会受到师傅的惩罚。于是卢梭索性不回家，身无分文地流浪到其他地方。
几天后，他遇到了一位名叫瓦朗的女士，她收留了卢梭。她送他去教堂接受正规教育，并让他皈依了天主教。
卢梭在《忏悔录》中提到，他在16岁时曾受到天主教会成员的性骚扰。有人试图引诱年轻的卢梭。
他去抱怨，却被告知他只是个孩子在胡说八道。因此，他在教会的经历并不愉快。
后来，卢梭去巴黎寻找瓦朗夫人，两人同居并日久生情。
因为卢梭有音乐天赋，他在巴黎担任音乐教师，并通过编曲赚钱。
由于19世纪之前没有大学哲学系，许多哲学家都靠担任私人教师赚钱。
卢梭的音乐才华使他得以进入巴黎上流社会。他遇到了当时哲学界的中心人物狄德罗。
狄德罗当时正在编写《百科全书》项目，于是他请卢梭撰写音乐词条。
结果，狄德罗因为发表“天赋观念不存在”的言论而被捕入狱。
因为天主教会认为人与生俱来带有原罪，并天生拥有上帝的观念。这些都是天赋观念。如果你敢于挑战它，就是挑战教会的权威。
当卢梭去监狱探望狄德罗时，他在报纸上看到他们正在征集一篇论文竞赛的稿件。
题目是“科学和艺术的复兴是否有助于道德的净化或败坏？”。卢梭在思考这个题目时，突然领悟了一些东西。
于是他写了一篇文章，论证科学和艺术越发达，人类文明就越堕落。结果，他获得了第一名，并因此在法国声名鹊起。
后来，他再次参加了写作竞赛。这次的题目是“论不平等的起源”。
卢梭这次的投稿使他声名大噪，他从一个音乐家转变为一个哲学家。
这本书成为欧洲最具影响力的著作。许多法国大革命的革命者在阅读这本书后受到启发，认识到不平等并非命中注定，社会是可以改变的。
在今天的这一集中，我们将介绍卢梭的这部重要著作《论人类不平等的起源与基础》。

### 不平等的起源：自然还是社会？

To find the origin of inequality, the first step we should take is to ask: Is inequality natural, or is it created by human society itself?
For example, we see capitalism causing inequality in today's society. Many people will say that this is human nature.
Capitalists are just exhibiting the greed of human nature. Inequality in society is merely derived from natural inequality.
This defense presupposes that inequality is natural human nature, rather than human nature shaped by society. In that case, no matter how you change society, it's useless.
But if greed is actually shaped by society, and you portray it as innate, then you're committing a fallacy.
Therefore, Rousseau believes: We must distinguish between human nature unpolluted by civilization, and human nature socialized by civilized society.
Only then can we know when inequality began to appear.
For example, Aristotle believed that inequality was destined at birth. Everyone is born with different IQs, appearances, and physical abilities.
Some people are just born lucky and win the genetic lottery. That's why they easily achieve success in society.
Aristotle used this view to justify the Greeks' enslavement of foreigners, saying that Greeks are naturally more suitable to be masters.
Rousseau now wants to refute this argument that 'inequality is caused by nature'.
Suppose someone is born with physical or mental disabilities. You would say that this is called innate inequality.
But Rousseau now says, no. How a congenitally blind person is treated depends entirely on society.
In many ancient cultures, blind people were regarded as having predictive abilities and were worshiped as prophets.
But in industrial societies that value labor, blind people are regarded as useless.
So inequality is not caused by nature, but by humans themselves. Nature itself has no issue of justice or injustice.
So to know the origin of inequality, Rousseau says: We must envision a world unpolluted by civilization.
Rousseau calls it the 'state of nature'. The state of nature means that there are no human factors interfering with our observation of human nature.
Extracting people from society, people can be self-sufficient like wild animals, like Disney's Tarzan.
This state can reflect the original appearance of human nature. On the contrary, people in civilized society have been polluted.
Rousseau wants us to compare animals in nature with animals domesticated by humans.
Wild dogs are stronger and can hunt for prey themselves. But domesticated dogs have lost their ability to find food on their own.
Now Rousseau says: Humans themselves are the animals that have been domesticated by civilization.
Civilization has made humans weak and sickly. People in the state of nature are actually stronger.
Because primitive people relied on their physical strength to hunt. But after civilization invented various tools, people's ability to survive on their own has weakened instead.
If you throw a civilized person into the jungle, they might not survive a week.
Although civilization has the most advanced medical technology, but in the most advanced countries, citizens suffer from various diseases of civilization: depression, cancer, insomnia.
In Rousseau's view, this is a symptom of civilization. Diseases that civilized people create themselves, which primitives simply don't have.
However, although Rousseau criticized civilization, he is not anti-civilization.
Rousseau didn't tell everyone to go back to living in primitive tribes. But to use it to shatter the illusions of modern people.
Believing that human nature is inherently evil, that inequality originates from the natural disposition of certain people.
Rousseau believed quite the opposite: People are good and kind in the state of nature. There is no problem of inequality.
This was a very bold idea at the time. Because 18th-century Europe was still ruled by the church.
People believed that humans are born with original sin and need to rely on education and joining the church to be saved.
Rousseau surprisingly argued that people are born good and kind, and degenerate after entering civilized society.
This theory caused a great shock at the time. Several of Rousseau's books were also banned.

为了探寻不平等的起源，我们首先要问：不平等是自然的，还是人类社会本身所造成的？
例如，我们看到**资本主义** (Capitalism: 一种经济和社会制度，生产资料私有，追求利润最大化) 在当今社会造成了不平等。许多人会说这是人性使然。
资本家只是展现了人性的贪婪。社会中的不平等仅仅源于自然的不平等。
这种辩护预设了不平等是自然人性，而不是社会塑造的人性。那样的话，无论你如何改变社会，都是徒劳无功的。
但如果贪婪实际上是由社会塑造的，而你却将其描绘成与生俱来的，那么你就犯了一个谬误。
因此，卢梭认为：我们必须区分未受文明污染的人性，以及被文明社会社会化后的人性。
只有这样，我们才能知道不平等何时开始出现。
例如，亚里士多德认为不平等是与生俱来的。每个人出生时智商、外貌和身体能力各不相同。
有些人天生幸运，赢得了基因彩票。这就是为什么他们很容易在社会上取得成功。
亚里士多德用这种观点来为希腊人奴役外国人辩护，声称希腊人天生就更适合成为主人。
卢梭现在要驳斥这种“不平等是由自然造成的”论点。
假设有人天生有身体或精神残疾。你会说这叫做先天不平等。
但卢梭现在说，不。一个先天失明的人如何被对待，完全取决于社会。
在许多古代文化中，盲人被认为具有预知能力，并被尊崇为先知。
但在重视劳动的工业社会中，盲人则被视为无用之人。
所以不平等不是由自然造成的，而是由人类自己造成的。自然本身没有正义或非正义的问题。
因此，为了了解不平等的起源，卢梭说：我们必须设想一个未受文明污染的世界。
卢梭称之为“**自然状态**” (State of Nature: 人类在文明社会出现之前的原始状态)。自然状态意味着没有人类因素干扰我们对人性的观察。
将人从社会中抽离出来，人可以像野生动物一样自给自足，就像迪士尼的泰山一样。
这种状态可以反映人性的原始面貌。相反，文明社会中的人已经被污染了。
卢梭希望我们比较自然界的动物和被人类驯化的动物。
野狗更强壮，可以自己捕食。但家养的狗已经失去了自己寻找食物的能力。
现在卢梭说：人类本身就是被文明驯化的动物。
文明使人类变得虚弱多病。处于自然状态的人实际上更强壮。
因为原始人依靠体力狩猎。但文明发明了各种工具后，人们的自生能力反而减弱了。
如果你把一个文明人扔进丛林，他们可能活不过一周。
尽管文明拥有最先进的医疗技术，但在最先进的国家，公民却患有各种文明病：抑郁症、癌症、失眠。
在卢梭看来，这是文明的症状。文明人自己制造的疾病，原始人根本没有。
然而，尽管卢梭批评文明，但他并非反文明。
卢梭并没有告诉大家回到原始部落生活。而是用它来打破现代人的幻想。
认为人性本恶，认为不平等源于某些人的天性。
卢梭的观点恰恰相反：在自然状态下，人是善良友好的。没有不平等的问题。
这在当时是一个非常大胆的想法。因为18世纪的欧洲仍然受教会统治。
人们相信人生来带有原罪，需要依靠教育和加入教会才能得到救赎。
卢梭出人意料地提出，人天生善良，进入文明社会后反而堕落了。
这一理论在当时引起了巨大震动。卢梭的几本书也被查禁。

### “自然状态”下的人性：自爱与怜悯

So what does the most original human nature look like? Rousseau believed that the most original human nature consists of two forces.
First, people have a love of self-preservation. This is the most primitive animalistic nature of humans.
Human behavior is all about self-preservation, allowing oneself to live. This is also why people love their parents, because parental care helps survival.
This instinct for self-preservation does not lead to bad consequences. A primitive person goes out hunting to fill their stomach, it will not create an unequal society.
You might retort by saying, if several hunters are competing for limited resources, wouldn't there be a problem of uneven resource distribution? Then inequality will appear.
Rousseau believed that thinking this way is projecting the perspective of modern people onto primitive people.
In true primitive life, there is no need to compete for resources at all. Because nature is full of fruits and prey everywhere.
Primitive people don't need to compete at all. Just go to the mountains and forests to pick fruits when you are hungry.
Thinking that resources are limited and that you need to plan for the long term is a mindset that only civilized humans have.
Because civilized people live in cities, resources are controlled by the wealthy, so they think resources are very scarce, and don't understand the abundance of nature.
Rousseau even believed that the concept of "future" only exists in civilized society.
Primitive people don't need to worry about the future at all, but live in the moment, just trying to survive.
In short, self-love for one's own benefit does not lead to inequality.
In addition to self-love, there is another human trait that benefits the continuation of the entire species, and that is compassion.
People feel pain themselves when they see a sentient being suffering. For example, theater audiences feel pity when they see a wild beast snatching a child.
This kind of compassion can also be observed in the animal kingdom. Animals feel compassion when they see their own kind suffering.
Rousseau believed that this compassion is the source of almost all virtues and good deeds. So compassion cannot be the origin of inequality either.

那么，最原始的人性是什么样子的呢？卢梭认为，最原始的人性由两种力量构成。
首先，人们有一种自保之爱。这是人类最原始的动物性。
人类的行为都是为了自保，让自己活下去。这也是为什么人们爱自己的父母，因为父母的照护有助于生存。
这种自保的本能不会导致不好的后果。一个原始人出去打猎填饱肚子，并不会创造一个不平等的社会。
你可能会反驳说，如果几个猎人争夺有限的资源，难道不会出现资源分配不均的问题吗？那么不平等就会出现。
卢梭认为，这样想是把现代人的视角投射到了原始人身上。
在真正的原始生活中，根本不需要争夺资源。因为大自然到处都是果实和猎物。
原始人根本不需要竞争，饿了就去山林里采摘果实。
认为资源有限，需要长远规划，这只是文明人才有的心态。
因为文明人生活在城市，资源被富人掌控，所以他们认为资源非常稀缺，不了解大自然的丰饶。
卢梭甚至认为，“未来”的概念只存在于文明社会中。
原始人根本不需要担心未来，而是活在当下，只求生存。
简而言之，为自身利益的自爱并不会导致不平等。
除了自爱之外，人类还有另一种有利于整个物种延续的特质，那就是怜悯。
当人们看到有生命的存在遭受痛苦时，自己也会感到痛苦。例如，剧场观众看到野兽抢走孩子时，会感到怜悯。
这种怜悯在动物界也能观察到。动物看到同类受苦时会感到怜悯。
卢梭认为，这种怜悯是几乎所有美德和善行的源泉。所以怜悯也不能成为不平等的起源。

### 人类特有的“可完善性”与“自由意志”

In addition to self-love and compassion, there are two other human traits that animals do not have: one is perfectibility.
A person's inner potential can be perfected through the environment. For example, language ability.
People are born with the potential to learn languages, but they still need to learn through nurture to develop it.
Animals, on the other hand, do not have the potential to learn languages. So no matter how you teach them, they won't learn.
Humans have infinite plasticity and can be shaped by the environment, changed to the point where you can't even see the original nature.
This is why many theories of human nature are wrong in Rousseau's view. They are not talking about the most primitive human nature at all, but human nature that has been transformed by the environment.
Finally, the difference between humans and animals lies in this: humans have free will to choose.
Animals can only follow the natural laws of cause and effect, but humans can resist.
For example, hunger is a natural stimulus, and animals will look for food when they are hungry.
But humans can exercise freedom to resist hunger, for example, by going on a hunger strike.
These four human traits in the state of nature, self-love, compassion, perfectibility, and free will, we cannot find the origin of inequality in any of them.
So Rousseau believed that inequality must not originate from nature.
The state of nature was instead the golden age when humans lived the happiest and healthiest. It was after entering civilized society that all kinds of suffering began to appear.
If the state of nature is so good and civilization is so bitter, then humans would definitely not leave the state of nature voluntarily.
It must have been some accident that led humans to civilization.
So although Rousseau is classified as left-wing, he is very different from most leftists.
Leftists generally believe that enlightenment will bring historical progress to mankind, but Rousseau doubts whether history is really progressing.
So rather than saying that Rousseau is an Enlightenment philosopher, it is better to say that he is an "anti-Enlightenment" philosopher.
He believes that modern civilization has led to the degradation of human nature.
So the first conclusion Rousseau draws is: Inequality doesn't originate in nature; it inevitably stems from something created by humans themselves.
Having argued that the origin of inequality is not natural or inherent in human nature... Rousseau will now directly answer: What is the origin of inequality, then?

除了自爱和怜悯之外，人类还有另外两种动物不具备的特质：一是**可完善性** (Perfectibility: 人类通过环境和社会发展自身潜能的能力)。
一个人的内在潜力可以通过环境得到完善。例如，语言能力。
人天生具备学习语言的潜力，但仍需要通过后天学习来发展它。
而动物则不具备学习语言的潜力。所以无论你如何教它们，它们都不会学会。
人类具有无限的可塑性，可以被环境塑造，改变到你甚至看不到其原始本性的程度。
这就是为什么在卢梭看来，许多关于人性的理论都是错误的。它们根本不是在谈论最原始的人性，而是已经被环境改造过的人性。
最后，人与动物的区别在于：人拥有**自由意志** (Free Will: 人类选择和抵抗自然冲动的能力) 去选择。
动物只能遵循自然的因果法则，但人类可以抵抗。
例如，饥饿是一种自然的刺激，动物饿了就会寻找食物。
但人类可以运用自由来抵抗饥饿，例如通过绝食。
自然状态下的这四种人类特质——自爱、怜悯、可完善性和自由意志——我们无法从中找到不平等的起源。
所以卢梭认为，不平等必定不是源于自然。
自然状态反而是人类生活最幸福、最健康的黄金时代。是进入文明社会后，各种苦难才开始出现。
如果自然状态如此美好，而文明如此痛苦，那么人类肯定不会自愿离开自然状态。
必然是某种偶然事件导致人类走向了文明。
因此，尽管卢梭被归类为左派，但他与大多数左派非常不同。
左派普遍认为启蒙会给人类带来历史的进步，但卢梭却怀疑历史是否真的在进步。
所以与其说卢梭是启蒙哲学家，不如说他是一位“反启蒙”哲学家。
他认为现代文明导致了人性的堕落。
所以卢梭得出的第一个结论是：不平等并非源于自然；它必然源于人类自身创造的东西。
在论证了不平等的起源并非自然或人性固有的之后……卢梭现在将直接回答：那么，不平等的起源究竟是什么？

### “自尊心”：不平等的真正根源

Rousseau believes that when human society develops to a certain stage, transitioning from independent, self-sufficient primitive humans to communal human societies, people gather together to sing and dance in their leisure time.
People will start to think: Who dances better? Who sings better? Who is more attractive and suitable as a partner?
They begin to evaluate others and compare who is more attractive.
Because everyone wants to be the most charming person in the eyes of their beloved. But once this comparative mentality starts to spread, human psychology begins to deteriorate and become corrupted.
People become increasingly concerned with others' opinions and crave a sense of superiority. They want others to love them more than they love themselves.
The "self-love" of the natural state transforms into "vanity" or even "narcissism." This psychology is what Rousseau calls: **l’amour-propre** (自尊心/虚荣心: 卢梭哲学中指人对他人评价的关注和追求优越感的心态)。
This vanity is not the original state of human nature, but rather a distorted state shaped by society.
Because primitive humans in the natural state wouldn't compare who owns more.
Just as a squirrel accumulates nuts only for its own needs, not to make other squirrels jealous.
The primitive human's sense of superiority is only exerted on animals. For example, discovering that they can run faster than their prey, they feel that humans are superior beings.
But after human society develops to a certain stage, humanity's sense of superiority actually turns towards its own kind.
Now people not only have to conquer beasts, but also conquer others. Every time you meet someone, you mentally weigh them up.
Mentally calculating who is more capable. Even if you are already very wealthy, as long as you meet someone even wealthier than you, you will still feel poor.
And you will crave to earn even more money. The point is not how much I actually own, nor whether I really need more, but whether I appear superior to others in their eyes.
Rousseau believes that this is the origin of inequality in human society. It is because human vanity, amour-propre, has been awakened.
Primitive humans have since become comparative beings. They live for the gaze of others.
Pursuing being the best, richer, or more attractive than others. All kinds of evils in human history can be traced back to this psychology.

卢梭认为，当人类社会发展到一定阶段，从独立、自给自足的原始人过渡到群居社会时，人们会在闲暇时聚集在一起唱歌跳舞。
人们会开始思考：谁跳舞跳得更好？谁唱歌唱得更好？谁更具魅力，更适合作为伴侣？
他们开始评价他人，比较谁更具吸引力。
因为每个人都希望成为自己所爱之人眼中最有魅力的人。但一旦这种比较心态开始蔓延，人类的心理就开始恶化并被腐蚀。
人们越来越关注他人的看法，渴望一种优越感。他们希望别人爱他们胜过爱自己。
自然状态下的“自爱”转变为“虚荣心”甚至“自恋”。这种心理就是卢梭所说的：**l’amour-propre** (自尊心/虚荣心: 卢梭哲学中指人对他人评价的关注和追求优越感的心态)。
这种虚荣心并非人性的原始状态，而是一种被社会塑造的扭曲状态。
因为自然状态下的原始人不会比较谁拥有更多。
就像松鼠囤积坚果只是为了自己的需求，而不是为了让其他松鼠嫉妒。
原始人的优越感只施加于动物。例如，发现自己比猎物跑得快，他们会觉得自己是优越的生物。
但人类社会发展到一定阶段后，人类的优越感实际上转向了同类。
现在人们不仅要征服野兽，还要征服他人。每次遇到一个人，你都会在心里掂量一下。
在心里盘算谁更有能力。即使你已经很富有，只要遇到比你更富有的人，你仍然会感到贫穷。
你会渴望赚更多的钱。重点不是我实际拥有多少，也不是我是否真的需要更多，而是我在别人眼中是否显得更优越。
卢梭认为，这就是人类社会不平等的起源。正是因为人类的虚荣心，即l’amour-propre，被唤醒了。
原始人从此成为比较性的存在。他们活在他人的目光中。
追求成为比别人更好、更富有或更有魅力的人。人类历史上的各种邪恶都可以追溯到这种心理。

### 私有财产与国家的诞生

For example, how does wealth inequality arise? Rousseau believes that after agriculture and the division of labor appeared in human civilization, people have become increasingly dependent on each other's labor.
Losing the ability to be self-sufficient. Primitive humans could live independently, but civilized people cannot.
People with strong vanity take advantage of this weakness. Enclosing land that was originally common property.
Telling a group of ignorant people... This land is my private property. And these people are foolish enough to believe it.
Rousseau said: This is the origin of civilization. It's that someone, to satisfy their desire to feel superior, introduced the concept of private property into the community.
Making people forget that the land doesn't belong to anyone. In French, vanity (Amour-propre) and property (propriété) share the same etymological root.
But seizing land isn't enough. Because those deprived of land could unite and fight back.
So the rich have to unite to create a nation. Let the state establish an army to protect the property of the rich.
Enact laws, define what is justice. So when the poor want to rebel, the state will send troops to suppress them.
And tell the poor: you were the ones who disturbed social order first. You are the unjust party. This makes inequality appear legitimate.
So, in Rousseau's view, wealth inequality doesn't stem from economic problems.
Private property, the state, the legal system – these are all derived to maintain inequality.
The real root is actually a psychological problem. When people see that they have more than others, they feel a sense of superiority.
Inequality isn't because of human greed. Ancient kings and today's capitalists, what they really crave isn't money.
But the thrill of dominating others with wealth. Being able to make others envious, feel they are superior. This sense of domination is more satisfying than the money itself.
In Rousseau's view, those who possess a lot of wealth actually crave the attention of others.
That is to say, they don't really know what they want. But live under the gaze of others.
We all think rich people are happy. But rich people are actually very miserable.
Because they may not know what they want until they die. Life is just about constantly accumulating wealth to make others envious.

例如，财富不平等是如何产生的？卢梭认为，在人类文明中出现农业和分工之后，人们越来越依赖彼此的劳动。
失去了自给自足的能力。原始人可以独立生活，但文明人不能。
拥有强烈虚荣心的人利用了这一弱点，圈占了原本是公共财产的土地。
告诉一群无知的人……这片土地是我的私有财产。而这些人愚蠢到相信了它。
卢梭说：这就是文明的起源。是有人为了满足自己的优越感，将私有财产的概念引入了社群。
让人们忘记了土地不属于任何人。在法语中，虚荣心 (Amour-propre) 和财产 (propriété) 拥有相同的词源。
但仅仅占有土地是不够的。因为那些被剥夺土地的人可能会联合起来反抗。
所以富人必须联合起来建立一个国家。让国家建立军队来保护富人的财产。
制定法律，定义什么是正义。所以当穷人想要反抗时，国家就会派兵镇压他们。
并告诉穷人：是你们先扰乱社会秩序的。你们是不正义的一方。这使得不平等显得合法化。
因此，在卢梭看来，财富不平等并非源于经济问题。
私有财产、国家、法律体系——这些都是为了维护不平等而产生的。
真正的根源实际上是一个心理问题。当人们看到自己比别人拥有更多时，他们会产生一种优越感。
不平等并非因为人类的贪婪。古代的国王和今天的资本家，他们真正渴望的并非金钱。
而是用财富去支配他人的快感。能够让别人羡慕，觉得自己高人一等。这种支配感比金钱本身更令人满足。
在卢梭看来，那些拥有大量财富的人，实际上渴望的是他人的关注。
也就是说，他们并不知道自己真正想要什么，而是活在他人的目光之下。
我们都认为富人是幸福的。但富人实际上非常痛苦。
因为他们可能到死都不知道自己想要什么。人生只是不断积累财富以引人羡慕。

### 不平等的恶果：自由的丧失

In addition to wealth inequality, Rousseau believes the psychological mechanism behind love is also related to amour-propre.
Because when you fall in love with someone, it's equivalent to acknowledging that this person is the most attractive to you. The number one in the eyes of your lover.
Humanity invented marriage to satisfy people's amour-propre. Marrying someone is like publicly declaring to society, you are the best person I think.
You have won over other competitors. This is also why Rousseau believes people shouldn't cheat.
Because it's personally destroying the recognition you once gave to your partner. It's like trampling on the other person's self-esteem.
This is also the difference between civilized people and primitive people. Primitive people don't need a marriage system.
Nor do they have the concept of fidelity in love. They just follow their primal urges, constantly seeking sexual partners.
They also don't feel jealous or envious as a result.
We can also think about it in our daily lives. Many behaviors are actually driven by amour-propre.
For example, are many people working out for their own health, or to gain the envious looks of others?
Many parents say that education is for the good of their children. But is it for the child's own development, or to make others think they are good at raising children?
Rousseau's theory can be used to re-understand our relationship with ourselves and others.
Think about when we do something, is it to make others envy me, to gain the approval of others, or am I really doing it for myself?
After pointing out that the origin of inequality is amour-propre, Rousseau will now further argue why inequality is bad.
Rousseau believes that inequality must be criticized because it has immoral consequences.
The first is that economic inequality leads to a loss of freedom. The poorer people are, the more easily they are dominated by the rich.
Because the poor must rely on capitalists to give them work to eat. They are also forced to obey the will of the capitalists.
So why can't the poor refuse to work? Because in a highly specialized modern society, your food, clothing, housing, and transportation all rely on the labor of other workers.
To obtain these products to meet your needs, you must work to earn money. Sacrifice your freedom to work for the capitalists.
In other words, the way civilized society enslaves the general public is actually through artificial needs to create dependence.
Because you can't be self-sufficient, you need to rely on market goods. So you have to sacrifice your freedom to earn money.
The more you rely on goods produced by others, the more money you have to earn. The greater the freedom you sacrifice.
This leads to a slave-like character in civilized people. Even if the company doesn't force employees, employees will constantly flatter their superiors and bosses.
Because this is the way to please life. In comparison, primitive people don't need to please anyone.
Because in prehistoric times without specialized division of labor, primitive people relied on themselves for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation.
They didn't depend on anyone, so they could maintain their independence and autonomy.
For example, after Alexander the Great conquered the Ichthyophagi, a fishing and hunting tribe in the Persian Gulf, he discovered that they lived self-sufficient lives.
They didn't care about civilized things at all. Alexander the Great had to force them to give up eating fish, cutting off their means of livelihood, in order to rule them.
For example, we often say that it is very convenient to eat out in Taiwan. This gives people a feeling of freedom, you can eat whatever you want.
But Rousseau would say that this is an expression of unfreedom. Because you will become overly dependent on eating out, and lose your ability to cook for yourself.
If all the restaurants close one day, you will have to wait to starve to death.
In Rousseau's view, to break away from the state of unfreedom, you must judge whether my needs are real or false needs created by society.
After real needs are met, you will feel more satisfied and free. After false needs are met, you will feel more unfree and dependent on society.
For example, the number of likes and traffic on social media, are all false needs in Rousseau's view.
The logic behind this is that you want attention and praise from others. It means that you live under the rule of other people's opinions.
You have to cater to popular tastes to create content. The more you care about the number of views, the more you depend on others.
In the end, what you lose is your own freedom. The scary thing is, you may not even realize it.
Because once false needs become a habit, you will feel that they are real needs.
For example, many rich people consume, not to satisfy real needs, but to satisfy their own vanity of comparison.
Engaging in ostentatious consumption, buying luxury goods, and traveling everywhere, to highlight that they are superior to others.
These people seem to be consuming for themselves, but in fact, they are thinking of others when they consume.
Thinking about how to make people envy and be jealous.
Later, after World War II, the German philosopher **Marcuse** (Herbert Marcuse: 20世纪德国哲学家，法兰克福学派批判理论家) developed a theory of false needs very similar to Rousseau's.
To criticize contemporary high-consumption society. He believed that many needs were actually created by capitalism.
Making people more dependent on the market for easy rule. In fact, as early as the 18th century, when capitalism was just budding, Rousseau had already criticized this phenomenon once before.
Rousseau more clearly pointed out the psychological mechanisms behind it.

除了财富不平等，卢梭认为爱情背后的心理机制也与l’amour-propre有关。
因为当你爱上一个人时，就相当于承认这个人对你来说是最有魅力的。是你的爱人眼中最棒的那一个。
人类发明婚姻是为了满足人们的l’amour-propre。结婚就像是向社会公开宣告，你是我认为最优秀的人。
你战胜了其他竞争者。这也是卢梭认为人不应该出轨的原因。
因为它是在个人层面上摧毁了你曾经给予伴侣的认可。这就像是践踏了对方的自尊。
这也是文明人和原始人的区别。原始人不需要婚姻制度。
他们也没有爱情中的忠贞概念。他们只是遵循原始冲动，不断寻找性伴侣。
他们也不会因此感到嫉妒或羡慕。
我们也可以在日常生活中思考。许多行为实际上是由l’amour-propre驱动的。
例如，许多人健身是为了自己的健康，还是为了获得他人的羡慕目光？
许多父母说教育是为了孩子好。但究竟是为了孩子自身的发展，还是为了让别人认为他们善于养育孩子？
卢梭的理论可以用来重新理解我们与自己和他人的关系。
思考一下当我们做某事时，是为了让别人羡慕我，为了获得他人的认可，还是我真的在为自己做这件事？
在指出不平等的起源是l’amour-propre之后，卢梭现在将进一步论证不平等为什么是坏的。
卢梭认为，不平等必须受到批评，因为它会带来不道德的后果。
首先是经济不平等导致自由的丧失。穷人越贫穷，就越容易被富人支配。
因为穷人必须依靠资本家给他们工作才能吃饭。他们也被迫服从资本家的意志。
那么穷人为什么不能拒绝工作呢？因为在一个高度专业化的现代社会中，你的衣食住行都依赖于其他劳动者的劳动。
为了获得这些产品来满足你的需求，你必须工作赚钱。牺牲你的自由为资本家工作。
换句话说，文明社会奴役大众的方式，实际上是通过人造需求来制造依赖。
因为你无法自给自足，你需要依赖市场商品。所以你必须牺牲你的自由去赚钱。
你越依赖别人生产的商品，你就越需要赚钱。你牺牲的自由就越大。
这导致了文明人的奴性。即使公司不强迫员工，员工也会不断奉承上司和老板。
因为这是取悦生活的方式。相比之下，原始人不需要取悦任何人。
因为在没有专业分工的史前时代，原始人衣食住行都靠自己。
他们不依赖任何人，所以他们可以保持自己的独立和自主。
例如，亚历山大大帝征服了波斯湾的一个渔猎部落——食鱼族之后，他发现他们过着自给自足的生活。
他们根本不在乎文明世界的东西。亚历山大大帝不得不强迫他们放弃吃鱼，切断他们的生计，才能统治他们。
例如，我们常说在台湾外食很方便。这给人一种自由的感觉，你可以吃任何你想吃的东西。
但卢梭会说，这是一种不自由的表现。因为你会对外食过度依赖，而失去自己做饭的能力。
如果有一天所有餐厅都关门了，你将不得不等着饿死。
在卢梭看来，要摆脱不自由的状态，你必须判断我的需求是真实的，还是社会创造的虚假需求。
真实需求得到满足后，你会感到更满足和自由。虚假需求得到满足后，你会感到更不自由，更依赖社会。
例如，社交媒体上的点赞数和流量，在卢梭看来都是虚假需求。
这背后的逻辑是，你渴望他人的关注和赞扬。这意味着你活在他人的意见统治之下。
你必须迎合大众口味来创作内容。你越在乎浏览量，你就越依赖他人。
最终，你失去的是自己的自由。可怕的是，你甚至可能没有意识到。
因为一旦虚假需求成为习惯，你就会觉得它们是真实需求。
例如，许多富人消费，并非为了满足真实需求，而是为了满足自己攀比的虚荣心。
进行炫耀性消费，购买奢侈品，到处旅行，以突显自己比别人优越。
这些人看似在为自己消费，但实际上，他们在消费时是在想着别人。
想着如何让别人羡慕和嫉妒。
后来，二战结束后，德国哲学家**马尔库塞** (Herbert Marcuse: 20世纪德国哲学家，法兰克福学派批判理论家) 发展出一种与卢梭非常相似的虚假需求理论。
以批判当代高消费社会。他认为许多需求实际上是由资本主义创造的。
让人们更加依赖市场，以便于统治。事实上，早在18世纪，当资本主义刚刚萌芽时，卢梭就已经批判过这种现象。
卢梭更清晰地指出了这背后的心理机制。

### 不平等的恶果：普遍的不幸

Besides the loss of freedom, Rousseau believed inequality had another negative consequence.
That is, it harms the well-being of the majority of society. Rousseau said,
Even if the people at the very bottom of society can meet their basic needs, a large gap between the rich and the poor is still harmful to people.
Why? Because human amour-propre desires equal respect from others, to be treated as human.
But the poor in society are looked down upon by others. So Rousseau criticized inequality, not simply because of material poverty, but because of psychological factors.
Let's imagine that people at the bottom of society receive the minimum wage. Although they can afford three meals a day, they are still treated like corporate slaves or losers.
At the same time, they see many billionaires in society living enviable lives every day.
This immediately creates a sense of frustration in the hearts of the lower class.
Those who support capitalism will say, this gives the poor more motivation to make money and turn the tables.
This argument just doesn't understand Rousseau's criticism. Because even if you make a lot of money today, rise to the middle class, own a house and a car, as long as the psychological mechanism of amour-propre still exists, you will continue to compare yourself with those higher up.
Seeing others having more will make you feel desire. You will still feel unsatisfied.
So in an unequal society, all classes of people actually become more unhappy.
Because everyone wants to climb up, but there is no end.
Whenever you climb up a class, and gain a little satisfaction, once you see people above you owning more, your sense of satisfaction disappears instantly.
So what if people can't climb up? Rousseau believes there is another way to gain a sense of superiority.
That is to deliberately suppress those below you. Preventing others from climbing up. Your position will not be replaced by others.
Rousseau believes many of the sufferings in human society stem from this mentality.
If subordinates perform better than their superiors, they will climb up step by step. One day, they might surpass their superiors.
Therefore, superiors must suppress their subordinates. To maintain their own sense of superiority.
So, Rousseau said, "The desire for reputation turns all men into competitors."
This is the key to Rousseau's critique of inequality. To judge the quality of a country, you can see how severely social inequality undermines the well-being of its people.

除了自由的丧失，卢梭认为不平等还有另一个负面后果。
那就是它损害了社会大多数人的幸福。卢梭说：
即使社会最底层的人能够满足基本需求，贫富差距过大仍然对人们有害。
为什么？因为人类的l’amour-propre渴望获得他人的平等尊重，被当作人来对待。
但社会中的穷人却被他人看不起。所以卢梭批评不平等，并非仅仅因为物质贫困，更是因为心理因素。
让我们想象一下，社会底层的人领取最低工资。尽管他们能够负担一日三餐，但他们仍然被视为企业奴隶或失败者。
与此同时，他们看到社会上有许多亿万富翁每天过着令人羡慕的生活。
这立即在下层阶级心中产生了挫败感。
那些支持资本主义的人会说，这给了穷人更多赚钱翻身的原动力。
这种论点只是不理解卢梭的批判。因为即使你今天赚了很多钱，上升到中产阶级，拥有一套房子和一辆车，只要l’amour-propre的心理机制仍然存在，你就会继续与那些更高层的人比较。
看到别人拥有更多，就会让你产生欲望。你仍然会感到不满足。
所以在一个不平等的社会中，所有阶层的人实际上都变得更加不幸福。
因为每个人都想向上爬，但却没有尽头。
每当你爬升一个阶层，获得一点满足感，一旦你看到比你更高层的人拥有更多，你的满足感就会瞬间消失。
那么，如果人们无法向上爬怎么办？卢梭认为，还有另一种获得优越感的方式。
那就是故意压制比你低的人。阻止他人向上爬。你的位置就不会被别人取代。
卢梭认为，人类社会中的许多痛苦都源于这种心态。
如果下属表现优于上司，他们就会一步步向上爬。有一天，他们可能会超越上司。
因此，上司必须压制下属，以维持自己的优越感。
所以，卢梭说：“对名誉的渴望使所有人成为竞争者。”
这是卢梭批判不平等的关键。要判断一个国家的品质，你可以看社会不平等如何严重地损害其人民的幸福。

### “自尊心”的两面性

So far, amour-propre seems to have only negative consequences.
But Rousseau actually believes that the mentality of comparison can also lead to good outcomes.
Because the desire to compete for glory and be the best has also led to many inventions and creations of human civilization.
For example, the heroes in ancient Greek mythology all sought to make their names immortal.
Or the Olympic Games, where athletes from all countries yearn to be superior.
This mindset allows them to break through human potential and reach new heights.
If you read celebrity biographies, you'll find that many great people created great works with the underlying motivation to amaze others, showing that they are the most talented.
In these examples, we see that amour-propre can bring positive benefits, motivating people to do things that are beneficial to civilized society.
So Rousseau's theory is very dialectical. He doesn't say that the desire for superiority is all bad.
But rather that the same human desire creates many of the evils of civilization, but also creates many of its masterpieces.

到目前为止，l’amour-propre似乎只有负面后果。
但卢梭实际上认为，比较的心态也能带来好的结果。
因为争夺荣耀、追求卓越的欲望，也促成了人类文明的许多发明和创造。
例如，古希腊神话中的英雄们都寻求让自己的名字不朽。
或是奥林匹克运动会，各国运动员都渴望超越他人。
这种心态让他们突破人类潜力，达到新的高度。
如果你阅读名人传记，你会发现许多伟大的人物创作出伟大的作品，其根本动机是为了震撼他人，展示他们是最有才华的。
在这些例子中，我们看到l’amour-propre可以带来积极的好处，激励人们去做对文明社会有益的事情。
所以卢梭的理论是非常辩证的。他并不是说对优越感的渴望都是坏的。
而是说同样的人类欲望，既创造了文明的许多邪恶，也创造了许多杰作。

### 不平等为何难以根除？

Rousseau first reveals that the origin of inequality is not natural human nature, but the corrupted human nature of amour-propre.
Then he criticizes the various evils brought about by inequality.
Finally, Rousseau wants to ask further, why inequality causes so many social problems, why every time inequality appears in a society, it spreads like a plague.
Inequality can be seen in all human societies. If inequality brings so many evils, shouldn't people in society try their best to avoid it?
Rousseau's answer is also astonishing. He believes that because those oppressed by inequality actually participate in it actively.
The system can only continue with the acquiescence of the oppressed.
First, vested interests will instill false ideas in the public, telling the public that inequality is natural, and that everyone is born with different talents.
Capitalists are richer because they have more entrepreneurial talent.

卢梭首先揭示了不平等的起源并非自然人性，而是被腐蚀的l’amour-propre。
然后他批判了不平等带来的各种邪恶。
最后，卢梭想进一步追问，为什么不平等会造成如此多的社会问题，为什么每当不平等出现在一个社会中，它就会像瘟疫一样蔓延。
不平等在所有人类社会中都可以看到。如果不平等带来如此多的邪恶，社会中的人们难道不应该尽力避免它吗？
卢梭的答案也令人震惊。他认为，这是因为那些被不平等压迫的人，实际上也积极参与其中。
这个体系只有在被压迫者的默许下才能继续存在。
首先，既得利益者会向公众灌输错误的观念，告诉公众不平等是自然的，每个人天生就拥有不同的才能。
资本家之所以更富有，是因为他们拥有更多的创业才能。
