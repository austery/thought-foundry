### 礼来引领减重药物革命

**Nicola:** 大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金（**Norges Bank Investment Management**）的首席执行官尼古拉·坦根（Nicola Tangen）。今天，我非常荣幸能与制药巨头礼来（**Eli Lilly**）的首席执行官戴维·里克（David Ricks）先生同席。您可能知道，礼来公司正引领着减重药物的革命。我们持有该公司超过1%的股份，总价值达80亿美元。非常感谢您的到来，戴维，很高兴能与您在一起。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, I'm Nicola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund. And today, I am in particularly good company with David Ricks, the CEO of the pharma giant Eli Lilly. Now, Lilly is spearheading, as you may know, the weight-reducing drug revolution. We own more than 1% of the company, totaling $8 billion. Big thanks for coming, Dave. Great to be with you.</p>
</details>

**David:** 很高兴能与您在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, great to be with you.</p>

### GLP-1药物的广泛潜力与发现历程

**Nicola:** 现在，**GLP-1**（Glucagon-like peptide-1: 胰高血糖素样肽-1）药物在全世界引起了轰动，它们似乎能治疗从酒精中毒到阿尔茨海默症的各种疾病。为什么这些药物如此高效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, um, the uh, GLP-1 drugs sent uh, shock waves through the world and now they seems to be curing everything from alcoholism to Alzheimer's. So why are these drugs so efficient?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，这对于公司和医学科学来说，无疑都是一个激动人心的时刻，因为刺激GLP-1的理念实际上并非新鲜事物。礼来在2006年就推出了第一款GLP-1**激动剂**（Agonist: 能与受体结合并激活受体，产生生物效应的物质），距今已有近20年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's, well, it's certainly been exciting time for the company but also for medical science because this is actually not a very new idea to stimulate GLP-1. Um, Lilly launched the first GLP-1 Agonist in 2006, um, so almost 20 years ago.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明了医学技术是如何运作的：我们通常知道主要的治疗方向，但要制造出一种具有理想特性、能够实现最佳治疗效果的分子药物，需要时间和精力。我们现在已经发展到这些药物的第三代，例如**替西帕肽**（Tirzepatide: 一种双重激动剂，同时作用于GLP-1和GIP两种肠道激素），它是一种双重作用药物，同时作用于GLP-1和GIP这两种不同的肠道激素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but it's a, I think a good example of how the technology in medicine works is that often times, um, we know the sort of the the the major theme but making a molecule, making a medicine that behaves with properties that can um, achieve optimal outcomes takes time and effort and we're now on our really our third generation of these drugs with Tirzepatide, which is a dual acting, so it's GLP plus GIP, two different gut hormones.</p>
</details>

通过制造出作用平稳且持续时间长的药物，并且能够稍微提高剂量，我们发现这些药物不仅影响血糖和其他代谢因素，还可能影响大脑和食欲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I think by making drugs that were flat and lasted a long time and then we could dose a little higher, we've discovered that, um, we are not just affecting blood sugar and other, you know, metabolism factors, but affecting probably the brain and the desire.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 但是，当你们在2005年、2006年发现它时，减重效果更像是一种副作用，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when, when, when you discovered it in 2005, 2006, it was more like a side effect, wasn't it? The weight production.</p>
</details>

**David:** 这是一个积极的副作用。事实上，我们2007年年报的封面就有一位服用这种药物的女性，她说她的糖尿病得到了控制，体重也减轻了一些，人们都说她看起来更好了，所以她从一开始就注意到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was a positive side effect. In fact, a cover of our annual report in 2007 has a woman who took this medicine and she said, "I'm, my diabetes is under control and I'm losing a little weight, people say I look better." So she noticed it from the beginning.</p>
</details>

对于那款名为**艾塞那肽**（Exenatide）的药物来说，减重并非其设计目标，甚至对于其后续的每周一次药物**度拉糖肽**（dulaglutide，商品名Trulicity）也非设计目标。但对于替西帕肽这种双重作用的药物来说，减重就是其设计目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was not the design goal for that drug, Exenatide. It wasn't even the design goal for the follow-on to that, which was a weekly um, medicine called Trulicity or dulaglutide. It was a designed goal for Tirzepatide, which is these two act actions for weight loss.</p>
</details>

至于减重本身是否会产生您提到的这些广泛影响，例如痴呆症和阿尔茨海默症，那里的影响可能更多是血管性的，类似于心血管益处，可能会减少中风和轻微中风。这还需要进一步证实，但相关研究正在进行中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And whether the weight loss itself has these broad effects you mentioned, uh, dementia and Alzheimer's, and probably the effects there are more vascular, so similar to the cardiovascular benefits, probably reducing strokes and mini strokes. That needs to be proven, but you know, those studies are getting done.</p>
</details>

或者，这些激素在进食后由我们的胃肠道分泌，告诉我们的大脑我们已经饱了，这种欲望中心也影响着酒精消费、吸烟和其他人类享乐行为。因此，我们也在研究这些方面，因为在现代社会中，最伤害我们的可能就是我们自己的行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or this desire center where these these hormones are our our stomach, our gut secretes after we eat, tell our brain that we're full. And that that is also affecting alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, other kind of hedonic behaviors humans have. So we're also studying those things because, um, probably in modern society, the things that that harm us most are our own behaviors.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么，它还能预防哪些其他的享乐欲望呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what are the other hedonic desires that it can prevent?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我们知道吸烟是一个非常强烈的信号，今年您会看到礼来在戒烟方面进行大规模研究，这仍然是一个主要问题，尤其是在亚洲。酒精消费是我们立即在研究中注意到的，如果您回顾一下，确实会看到人们自我报告酒精摄入量显著减少，这对我们来说可能也是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we know smoking is a very strong signal and you'll see Lilly this this year conduct large studies in smoking cessation, which is still a major problem, uh, particularly in Asia. Um, alcohol consumption is something we immediately noticed in our studies. And if you go back and look, you do see people self-reporting pretty significant reductions in alcohol, which is also probably good for us.</p>
</details>

我们还在研究街头毒品。这些临床研究由于各种原因更为复杂，例如它们在许多国家是非法的，剂量控制也很困难。但这当然是一种祸害，尤其是在我的国家美国，整个阿片类药物危机一直很严重。它对阿片类药物的有效性不如吸烟那么确定，但我认为我们需要尝试一下。我认为礼来的宗旨就是解决重大的健康问题，肥胖是一个大问题，但阿片类药物成瘾也是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Um, we're also studying street drugs, um, and so these are more complicated clinical studies to undertake be for all kinds of reasons. They're illegal in many countries and dose control and so forth is difficult, but that of course is a scourge, particularly in my country in the US. The whole opioid crisis has been terrible. The probability that works isn't as certain as something like smoking, um, but I think we need to give it a shot. I think that's what Lilly's for is to take on big health problems and obesity is a big one, but but so is opioid addiction.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么，展望未来十年，这些药物的“蓝天情景”会是怎样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the blue sky scenario here at 10 years from now, what could these drugs do?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，我想您现在肯定能看到我们的愿景。我认为我们去年已经有证据表明，服用替西帕肽不仅能减重，而且大多数超重或肥胖的人都能达到健康的体重。顺便说一句，我们还有更多药物即将上市，可以针对体重更高的人群，或者使其更具可扩展性或更方便。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I think you you can certainly see in our sites now. I think we have evidence from the last year that not only do you lose weight and for most people who are overweight or obese can get to a healthy body weight on Tirzepatide. We have more medicines coming by the way, we could talk about that for people with even higher body weight or to be more scalable or more convenient.</p>
</details>

但我认为我们可以轻易地说，体重管理将变得更像一种选择，而非一种困扰，这是好事。我们还可以说，在过去的15个月里，我们了解到肥胖引起的下游疾病的许多主要类别都受到这些药物诱导的体重减轻的影响。这似乎是显而易见的，但事后看来，这是一个关键问题，即你是否仅仅影响了先决条件，还实际影响了疾病本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think we can easily say that weight management will become more like a choice than an affliction, and that's good. We can also say that we've learned in the last 15 months that major categories of downstream disease of obesity are affected by weight loss induced by these drugs. That seems obvious, but in hindsight, but you know, it is a key question is not do you just affect the kind of the precondition, but actually also the disease.</p>
</details>

心血管疾病风险已经得到证实，肾脏疾病，以及现在的肝脏疾病等。这很重要，因为这些疾病约占发达经济体医疗保健成本的40%。这本身就是一个“蓝天情景”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cardiovascular risk, which has been shown, um, kidney disease, um, now, uh, liver disease, etcetera. So that's important because those diseases make up about 40% of health care costs in in developed economies. So that's a blue sky scenario by itself.</p>
</details>

这里的关键在于规模化，因为目前礼来和诺和诺德（Novo Nordisk）可能只服务了全球不到2000万人，而全球可能有10亿超重或肥胖的人将患上这些慢性疾病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The trick there will be scaling, right? Because right now, between Lilly and Novo Nordisk, we may be serving less than 20 million people on the planet, and there might be a billion people with, um, overweight or obesity who are going to get these chronic diseases.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 一个愚蠢的问题，为什么会有多达10亿肥胖人口？为什么这个数字增长如此之快？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stupid question, but why are there as many as one billion obese people? Why is this increasing so much?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，我认为有很多理论，这是一个多因素的疾病或过程。但在很多方面，就像我们今天许多慢性疾病一样，它们实际上是我们祖先的生存偏见。食物和营养显然对生命至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it I think there's a lot of theories, it's a multi-factor, um, disease or process, but in many ways, like a lot of chronic illnesses we have today, were actually survival biases of our ancestors. And food and nutrients are obviously essential to life.</p>
</details>

所以，当我们的祖先在冰河时代四处奔波寻找食物时，囤积卡路里和保持体重是一种基因中的生存偏见。现在，这实际上正在伤害我们，因为我们生活在一个物质丰裕的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, when our ancestors were running around in the ice ages and, you know, looking for food, being a hoarder of calories and preserving body weight was a was a survival, uh, uh, bias in our genome. Now, that's actually hurting us because we live in a world of abundance.</p>
</details>

我认为这在世界各地都是如此，随着发达经济体的崛起，中等收入国家向发达国家转变，反之亦然，食物系统变得更加稳定，食物变得更加丰富。它可能比我们祖先吃的食物更不健康，而且更美味，更难以抗拒。所以我们的食物系统肯定有问题，我认为我们不应该回避这个话题，但丰裕本身也是问题的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think that's true around the world and as developed economies rise and middle-income countries go to developed and vice and so forth, food systems, food becomes more stable, it becomes more abundant, it probably is less healthy for us anyway than the foods our ancestors ate, um, and more tasty and it's harder to resist. So there's definitely something wrong in our food system. I don't think we should shy away from that conversation, but also abundance itself is is part of the problem.</p>
</details>

### 药物研发的挑战与效率提升

**Nicola:** 您曾说过，发现一种药物需要花费近30亿美元，耗时10年。那么，在两分钟内，您能解释一下如何发现一种药物吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you've said that he cost uh, just under three billion dollars to and takes 10 years to discover or to discover a drug. Now, like in two minutes, how do you, how do you discover a drug?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，也许我们先退一步。我们所做的是制造新的物质，新的分子，它们能够干预生物学。药物发现的两个经典问题是：我是否知道靶点？我是否瞄准了导致疾病的正确目标？然后，我能否以最大效果和最小副作用来作用于该靶点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, well, maybe just a step back. What what we do is we make new matter, new molecules that uh, interfere with Biology. The two classic problems in drug discovery are, do I know the target? Am I pointed at the right thing that is causing the disease? And then can I drug the target, um, with maximum effect and minimum side effects?</p>
</details>

这两点都非常困难。我们可能只了解所有生物学的10%到15%，所以选择靶点很困难，而作用于靶点则更难。大多数简单的靶点已经转化为药物了，其中许多是自然界的偶然发现，我们很久以前就发现了它们并将其转化为商业药物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that turns out, both those turn out to be very difficult things. We probably know 10, 15% of all biology, so picking the targets is hard, and then drugging the targets is even harder. Most the easy ones have turned into drugs already, um, and many of those were accidents of nature we we discovered long ago and converted into commercial drugs.</p>
</details>

创造全新的物质，使其像药物一样作用于已知靶点，是具有挑战性的。因此，由于这两个原因，存在大量的损耗：要么药物不够好，要么靶点不完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Creating brand new substances, um, that behave like drugs against known targets is challenging. So there's a lot of attrition for both those reasons, either the drug isn't good enough or the target wasn't exactly right.</p>
</details>

所以我们花费大量时间和金钱，并且有很多失败。药物开发中最大的成本就是失败。我们开始的大多数项目实际上都没有成功。但我们也需要以安全的方式开发新药，对吧？我们不能销售不安全的产品，我们需要有证据表明这些产品有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so we spend a lot of time and money and there's a lot of failure. The biggest cost in drug development is failure. Um, most of the things we start don't actually work. But then we also need to pursue drug new medicines in a way that's safe, right? We can't market things that are unsafe, and we need to have a knowledge base that is evidence that these things work.</p>
</details>

这需要时间，而且是一个相当连续、循序渐进的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that takes time and it's pretty serial, it's step by step.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 大多数制药公司在药物发现方面的工作方式都一样吗？还是你们有秘密武器？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, do most pharma groups uh, work the same way when it comes to drug discovery? Or have you got a secret way of doing it?</p>
</details>

**David:** 总的来说是的。不过，在我担任礼来公司高管期间，我们一直努力以不同的方式做事，以提高研发的生产力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In general, yes. Although, you know, in my tenure at Lilly, we've worked hard to do things a little bit differently to improve the productivity of R&D.</p>
</details>

如果您看看，如果我们把礼来和诺和诺德这两家减重药物公司从行业中剔除，该行业的市盈率约为12倍。这主要是因为研发投资的回报率接近于零。我们审视了这一点，并认为这显然不是我们满意的状况，于是我们尝试控制可以控制的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, if we look at, um, if we take out the the the weight loss companies of Lilly and Novo from the sector, the the C, the sector trades at like 12 times earnings. It and that's really because ROI on R&D investment is close to zero. And we looked at that and we said that's obviously not not an equation we're happy with and tried to control things we could control.</p>
</details>

快速了解更多生物学知识很困难，制造比其他药物更好的新药也非常困难。但我们努力做了两件事：一是我们做出决策和行动所需的时间，二是资产配置类型的讨论，即如何分散投资，如何决定何时放弃，以及什么样的证据足以继续前进，并在此设定高标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's hard to learn more about biology quickly and it's very difficult to make new drugs just better than others. But we worked on two things. One was that the time in which we take to make decisions and move, and the other is the asset allocation type discussion of how far do you spread your bets, how do you make decisions about when to quit, um, what kind of uh, evidence is sufficient to keep going and setting a high bar there for progression.</p>
</details>

事实上，我们现在比以往任何时候都更早地终止项目，并且以更高的标准来做，而且速度更快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in fact, we're actually killing projects earlier than we ever did before and doing so with a higher standard and we're doing it faster.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 你们在时间上做了什么？现在花费的时间与您加入公司时相比如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you done with the time? How what's the what's the time spent now compared to when you joined?</p>
</details>

**David:** 好的，我可以谈谈行业平均水平。2015年我们审视这个问题时，我们略低于行业平均水平。临床开发大约需要10年（从首次人体给药到在某个市场获得批准），临床前研究大约需要四到五年，总共将近15年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right, so the industry averages, I can speak. And in 2015, when we looked at this, we were a little worse than industry average. Is about 10 years in clinical development, so that's first human dose to approval in some market, and about four or five years pre-clinically, so in total almost 15 years of time.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我们的专利周期是20年，但一旦我们耗尽所有这些时间，最终在市场上的时间只有10到12年。这在很大程度上解释了为什么我们行业的投资回报率如此之低，因为开发新产品所需的时间比收获所发明产品的好处所需的时间还要长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, our our patent cycle, um, is we get a 20-year patent, but once we exhaust all all that time, we end up with like 10 or 12 years in market. So this explains, I think, in large part why return on investment in our sector is so poor because it takes you longer to develop a new thing, then you get to harvest the benefit of the thing you just invented.</p>
</details>

所以我们试图改变这一点。我们将临床前时间缩短了大约一半，从构思到首次给药大约需要两年半。然后，去年，从首次给药到批准大约需要5.9年，也就是六年。这几乎是我们同行所需时间的一半，如果我们能重复做到，这将是我们巨大的结构性优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we sought to change that. We've cut the preclinical time roughly in half. It takes us about two and a half years to go from idea to first dose. And then about six years, last year 5.9 years, to go from first dose to approval. So that's almost half the time of our peers, which is an enormous structural advantage we have if we can repeat it.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 实现这一目标的关键是什么？我的意思是，这些数字非常庞大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was the key to getting there? I mean, these are very big numbers.</p>
</details>

**David:** 有两件事。一是老式的流程工程，基本上是尽可能并行地做所有事情。这给我们的流程带来了一些财务风险。但举个小例子，很多生物技术公司会等到在动物身上获得令人信服的临床前证据，证明他们的药物有效后，才开始生产，并确定生产规模，为首次人体研究制造剂量。然后，生产规模扩大就成了关键路径。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, two things. One is just good old-fashioned kind of process engineering, basically doing everything you can in parallel. That puts some financial risk in our process. But just to give a small example, a lot of like biotechs will wait till they get compelling pre-clinical evidence in animals their drug is working before they run production and figure out production to do to make doses for a first human study. And then that production scale up part is on your critical path.</p>
</details>

我们现在真的不再那样做了。我们对所有项目都这样做，如果药物在动物身上无效，我们就会停止工作。所以我们基本上是提前时间线，进行并行处理，而不是串行处理。这是一个重要的工具，在新药开发系统中还有许多其他例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We really don't do that anymore. We make, we do that for everything, and then we just stop working on it if the if the drug isn't working in animals. So we basically pull timelines forward and do parallel processing versus serial. That's a big tool and there's many other examples of that in the system of making new drugs.</p>
</details>

另一个是决策时间。我们过去常常做完一个实验，然后大家围坐在一起，提出新问题，查看数据，重新处理数据，从一个步骤到另一个步骤有时需要九周到六个月。我们现在真的不再那样做了。现在我们预先规定需要看到什么才能推进。顺便说一句，这提高了决策质量。如果我们达到了目标，我们第二天就继续前进；如果我们错过了目标，我们就会暂停。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another one is decision-making time. So we used to like do an experiment and then all gather around and ask new questions and look at it and reprocess the data and it was taking us sometimes nine to uh, nine weeks to six months to move from step one step to another. We really don't do that anymore. Now we pre-specify what we need to see to advance. By the way, that improves decision quality. And if we hit that target, we just go the next day. If we miss the target, we pause.</p>
</details>

有时我们会重新审视数据，最终继续前进，但大多数时候，这加快了我们的决策速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, sometimes we re interrogate the data and we end up going, but most of the time it's sped up our decision-making.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 这都是严格的分析吗？还是这些决策中也有直觉的成分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is this all strictly analytical or is there an element of gut field to these decisions?</p>
</details>

**David:** 也有判断力，对吧？正如我所说，因为我们只了解一定量的生物学知识，所以人类的模式识别和经验非常重要。在经验方面，我认为礼来也具有结构性优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's judgment too, right? As I said, because we only know a certain amount of biology, human pattern recognition and experience is very important. On the experience side, I think Lilly does also have a structural advantage.</p>
</details>

你知道，我们过去常常因为总部设在印第安纳波利斯，远离其他制药公司而被取笑。但其中一个影响是人们在这里待的时间很长，住在这个国家很容易，人们倾向于留下来。我们公司科学家的平均任期超过10年。这给了人们足够的时间看到这个过程重复发生，并开始识别模式，而不是跳槽到另一家公司。我认为这在很大程度上帮助了我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, we used to get made fun of because we're based in Indianapolis and sort of far away from other drug companies, but one of the effects of that is people stay here a long time. Living in this part of the country is easy and people tend to. Our average tenure for scientists at the company is over 10 years. That gives people enough time to see the process repeat itself and begin to recognize patterns versus jump to another company. I think that's helped us along the way.</p>
</details>

然后，拥有像我们公司首席科学家丹·甘西（Dan Gansy）和他的团队这样优秀的人才，他们擅长识别模式，并且非常善于将个人偏好从流程中抽象出来。我认为，就像所有资本配置一样，这在您的业务中也是一个关键因素，我相信您也看到了这一点。您必须对想法保持冷静，而在大公司，尤其是在我们这个行业，这一直是个问题。人们希望从事他们认为领导者喜欢的项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then having great people like like, you know, our our our lead scientists in the company, Dan Gansy and his team, who are just good at recognizing patterns and are very good at abstracting personal, um, preferences from the process. And I think like all capital allocation, that's a key thing in your business, I'm sure you see that as well. You you have to be dispassionate about ideas and in big companies, particularly in our industry, that's been a problem. People want to work on the projects that they think the leader like.</p>
</details>

这最终会导致非常糟糕的决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that ends up in pretty bad decision making.</p>

<p class="english-text">So how many like super key people would you have when it comes to picking the right projects at the end of the day?</p>
</details>

**David:** 每个人都很关键，但可能在礼来研究实验室的领导层，有20到30人在所有治疗领域做出核心决策。

<details>

### AI在药物研发与生产中的作用

**Nicola:** 人工智能（AI）如何帮助你们，或者将如何帮助你们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does AI help you or will help you?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，它已经在很多方面帮助我们了，我认为我对人工智能非常乐观，不仅在我们这个行业，在所有行业都是如此。在药物发现方面，有很多关于正在成立的公司炒作，他们说“我们只需打开电脑，编写一些代码，就能发明新药”。我不认为我们离那一步很近。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's already helping us in many ways, and I think I'm a really positive, you know, optimist about AI not in our only in our sector, but in all sectors. You know, on the drug discovery side, there's a lot of hype about companies that are forming and say, "We'll just turn on a computer and write some code and we'll invent new drugs." I do not think we're close to that.</p>
</details>

湿实验室验证和拥有非常强大的数据集进行预测至关重要。更有可能的是，人工智能以及我们现在使用它的方式，是一种更精细的工具，可以预测单个实验，在某些情况下甚至不需要进行这些实验，因为我们认为它们不值得，药物不会成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, that wet lab validation and having really strong data sets to make predictions is critical. More likely, AI and what we're using it for now is a much more granular tool to predict individual experiments. In some cases, don't even conduct them because we don't think they're worth it, the drug won't succeed.</p>
</details>

提前淘汰项目，或者用合成数据增强实验，并丰富我们看待这些结果的方式，这些现在都已经发生了。但这些都是药物开发中的微小步骤，而不是某种神奇的“一键搞定”模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And knocking things out earlier or enhancing experiments with synthetic data and enriching sort of how we look at those results, that's already happening now. But these are micro steps in drug development versus some sort of magic, um, turn on a machine and make it happen all at once.</p>
</details>

但这让我们的科学家行动更快，让他们的实验室经验更有价值。我认为这两件事都在帮助我们。最终，我对生成式和扩散模型在帮助我们的化学家方面的应用感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that makes our scientists move faster and makes their their their um, laboratory experience more valuable, um, and I think both those things are helping us today. In the end, I'm excited about the use of um, generative and diffusion models to help our chemists.</p>
</details>

化学是我们工作中特别困难的一部分。化学空间非常广阔，大约是10的60次方，比宇宙中的星星还要多。而人类的思维受到很大限制。所以，当你使用像**ChatGPT**或**DALL-E**这样的工具来制作一个有趣的图像或类似的东西时，它会创造出一些奇特而富有创意的东西。机器在化学方面也能做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So chemistry is a particularly difficult part of what we do. The chemical space is vast, like 10 to the 60th, so it's more stars than are in the universe kind of possibilities, and humans are pretty constrained in our thinking. So like when you use uh, ChatGPT or DALL-E or one of these tools to make a silly image or something and it comes up with something odd and creative, the machine does that with chemistry as well.</p>
</details>

这不一定会成为药物，但它为我们的化学家提供了他们以前从未考虑过的新起点。我认为从长远来看，这对我们这个行业将非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's not going to be a drug, but it gives our chemist new starting points that they didn't consider before. And I think that's that long term is going to be very interesting for our sector.</p>
</details>

此外，还有许多其他方面，就像其他工业公司一样，我们已经开始规模化应用人工智能，它正在产生非常大的影响。去年最重要的一个方面是生产优化。如您所知，我们正在扩大GLP-1的生产规模，这一直是公司增长的关键制约因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there's many other parts like other industrial companies. We're already scaling AI and it's making a very large difference. One of the most important ones last year was in production optimization. So we have, we're scaling our GLP-1s, as you know, and that's been a key constraint to growth of the company.</p>
</details>

我们通过一次小小的干预，在生产的关键瓶颈中引入了大约8%的工艺效率提升。这使我们去年在该生产线上多出货了大约7%或8%的产品。如您所知，这相当于数亿美元，甚至可能10亿美元的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With like one small intervention, we did introduced about an 8% process efficiency in a key bottleneck in production. It allowed us to ship about seven or eight percent more product last year in that line. And as you know, that's worth hundreds of millions or maybe a billion dollars in revenue.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么，当你们在公司所有部门全面实施人工智能后，你们的流程会快多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you have implemented AI fully in all parts of the company, how much quicker will your process?</p>
</details>

**David:** 如果我们成功，我认为我们可以再次将时间缩短一半。有些事情是真正的限制，因为像我们研究的许多疾病过程都很缓慢，无法替代对药物使用者的观察。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we could cut times in half again if we're successful. There are some things that are real constraints because like disease processes, many of the ones we study are slow. And there is no replacing, um, the watching of someone on a drug or not on a drug.</p>
</details>

以阿尔茨海默病为例，这是一个从诊断到死亡长达七年的过程，我们需要研究其中有意义的一部分才能证明药物有效。人类疾病过程是无法回避的。但许多导致最终研究的其他事情，我们有可能做得更快。我很高兴看到这种情况发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take like Alzheimer's disease. This is a seven-year process from diagnosis to death, and we need to study a meaningful part of that to prove a medicine is working. There's no getting around that human disease process. But many of the other things that lead up to that final study, we could potentially do much quicker, and I'd be I'd be excited to see that happen.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 与欧洲相比，在美国进行整个药物发现和开发过程容易多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much easier is the whole uh, process uh, to do in the US compared to Europe? Drug discovery and development.</p>
</details>

**David:** 实际上，这两个市场之间并没有太大区别。我们在欧洲和美国都有庞大的业务。这两个是我们生产和科学的两个中心，包括临床试验和发现。美国可能发现更多，而欧洲的临床试验比例更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's not that different actually between the two markets. We have huge operations in Europe as we do in the US. Those are our two centers for both production and science, clinical trials, as well as discovery. Probably more discovery in the US and um, proportionately more clinical trials in Europe.</p>
</details>

### 全球市场准入的差异与挑战

**David:** 不同的地方在于市场方面。欧洲的技术采用速度非常慢，而美国则快得多。这对我们在欧洲大陆的利益来说是个问题，因为我们的专利寿命是有限的。如果其中有相当一部分时间被政府批准药物、将其纳入各国处方集，然后通过医院层面的程序才能使用所消耗，那对我们来说是真正的浪费，对无法获得药物的患者来说也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The thing that's different in the is the market side. So the adoption of technology in Europe is super slow. In the US is quite a bit faster. And I that's a problem for us in terms of our interest in the European continent because we are on the clock with our patent life. And if a meaningful part of that is absorbed with the government processes to get a drug approved and get it uh, on formularies in countries and then go through procedures at the hospital level to get used, it's really a waste, um, for for us, but also for patients who can't access the the medicine.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 从你们启动一个项目到开始销售药物，欧洲和美国之间的时间差异是多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From your start a pro uh, a project until you start to sell the drug, what's the time difference between Europe and the US?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，直到提交申请之前，一切都一样。我们通常先在美国提交，然后在几周内提交到欧洲。对我们来说，欧盟的批准通常比美国晚三到四个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, everything's the same up until submission. We typically submit in the US first and then within a few weeks into Europe. It's normal for us to have approval in Europe three to four months after, um, this is in the EU, after um, the US.</p>
</details>

然后，考虑实际患者获得药物的平均时间，在欧洲，这通常在批准后两年多。所以是四个月加上额外的24个月，这样我们就差不多晚了两年半。这很痛苦，因为它很慢。但更糟糕的是，这意味着在10到12年的商业化周期中，你少了两年半的时间来商业化你的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the a way to think about it is what's your average time to real patient access on the ground? And in Europe, that's a little over two years post approval. So it's the four months plus 24 more months. So here we're, you know, almost out to two and a half years later. And that's painful because it's slow.</p>
</details>

所以这确实拖累了我们和医疗保健系统的价值创造。我们认为我们生产的药物对医疗保健系统和患者都很有价值，但这是一种额外的负担。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's worse even than that because what that means is you have two and a half years less out of 10 to 12 years to commercialize your product. So it's really a drag on, um, on value creation for us and the healthcare system. We think the medicines we make are valuable for the healthcare system and patients. That's a tax on that as well.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 欧洲正在采取措施纠正这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is Europe doing anything to rectify this situation?</p>
</details>

**David:** 有一些讨论。我们在**欧洲议会**（European Parliament）就27个成员国之间的准入差异进行了大量对话。但大多数结果都是“大棒”而非“胡萝卜”。我们希望看到激励措施，鼓励各国更快行动，甚至有一个想法是，我们为什么不假定覆盖，然后通过流程淘汰那些价值较低的药物，而不是反其道而行之？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's discussions about it. We've had a lot of dialogue in the European Parliament about the access differences between the 27 member states. And, um, most of what's come out of that are sticks, not carrots. We'd like to see incentives for countries to move faster and even an idea that why don't we presume coverage and then eliminate drugs that are less valuable through the process and and red tape versus the other way around?</p>
</details>

目前，大多数欧洲国家都假定新药没有价值，然后通过一个流程来判断是否有任何价值。我认为这是根本问题。此外，管理医疗保健系统是国家权限，存在难以解决的国家差异。我希望我对减少欧洲官僚主义持乐观态度，但我没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right now, most European countries presume no value for new drugs and then go through a process to see if there's any value. And I think that's the fundamental issue. Plus, you know, it's a it's a national competence running your healthcare system and there's national differences that are difficult to work through. Uh, I wish I was an optimist about reducing European bureaucracy. I'm not.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么中国呢？中国的情况如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about China? What's the situation in China?</p>
</details>

**David:** 坦率地说，情况正好相反。我大约15年前曾负责我们在中国的业务。当时，美国和中国之间的药物滞后（我们称之为患者准入）是七年。也就是说，我们在美国上市的药物，在中国要晚七年才能上市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reverse, frankly. So you, I used to run our Chinese business about 15 years ago. And at that time, the drug lag between the US and China, that's what we would call that patient access. So if it's two and a half years for Europe, at the time it was seven years for China. So medicines we were launching had been launched seven years ago in the US.</p>
</details>

现在，这个滞后时间已经缩短到不到12个月。所以中国在药物滞后方面已经超越了欧洲，他们的目标是成为我们全球首发产品的地方。他们雄心勃勃。他们的监管体系已经显著改善，并且在标准和审查时间方面几乎与**欧洲药品管理局**（European Medicines Agency: EMA）、**美国食品药品监督管理局**（Food and Drug Administration: FDA）和日本等主要监管机构保持一致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right now, that lag is coming down to less than 12 months. So already China has leapfrogged over Europe in the drug lag, and their goal is to be the first place we launch things in the world. So they're ambitious as they can be. Their regulatory system has improved dramatically and almost harmonized with, um, the major other regulators like EMA in Europe, FDA and Japan in terms of standards and review times.</p>
</details>

在市场准入方面仍然有点慢，这是一个日历化的过程。如果你在1月5日上市，实际上要等到第二年1月才能进入处方集。所以如果你在12月5日上市，你可以在几个月内进入。我们希望看到这一点改变，但他们在医疗系统现代化方面取得了很大进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's still a little slower on market access. It's a calendarized process. So if you launch on January 5th, um, you actually cannot get on the formularies until January of the next year. So that's a problem. If you launch on December 5th, you get, you can get on in a few months. So, uh, we like to see that changed, but they they've made a lot of strides, uh, in kind of modernizing their health system.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么中国的药物发现情况如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what about the drug discovery coming out of China?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，非常了不起。这些公司对所有主要公司来说既是合作者也是竞争者，我非常关注这些发展。那里有一些规模化的生物技术公司，其中许多我们都在中国内外与他们合作。那里正在出现一些新兴的小型生物技术集群，主要研究已知靶点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's tremendous. Uh, those are both collaborators and competitors for all major companies, and I pay keen attention to those developments. There are some scaled, um, biotech companies there, many of which we are partnered with in China and outside of it. There are emerging, um, small biotech, um, clusters there, mostly working on known targets.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你回到我之前说的药物开发的两个问题：什么是正确的靶点？然后我能否制造出一种只作用于该靶点的优秀药物？他们主要在解决第二个问题。我认为这会导致更多“me-too”类的药物，这可能是任何国家建立创新生态系统的一部分。最终，他们将不得不致力于发现新的靶点，这目前主要发生在西方，但我相信他们也会成为这方面的领导者。他们现在拥有巨大的科学能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you go back to what I said, what are the two problems in drug development? What's the right target? And then can I make a good medicine that only hits that target? They're mostly working on that second problem. And I think that leads to more me better me too kind of drugs, and that's probably part of any country, um, building an innovative ecosystem. Um, eventually they're going to have to work on discovering new targets, which mostly happens in the west now, but, um, you know, I I bet they'll be a leader in that too. They have tremendous scientific capabilities now.</p>
</details>

### 礼来公司的文化与领导力

**Nicola:** 您有商业背景，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have a business background, right?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您认为与拥有更多制药背景的人相比，您有什么不同之处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think you do differently compared to if you had had a far more background?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，我认为人们所说的背景，我的意思是，我花了四年时间在本科学习工程学和商科，然后两年时间攻读MBA。但我已经在一家制药公司工作了28年，所以我可能比只在学校学习过一般商科的人更了解制药行业的各个方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I think the people say background, I mean, we could I spent, you know, four years in undergrad studying engineering, business, and then two years getting an MBA. But I've spent 28 years working in a pharma company, so I probably know a lot more about the pharmaceutical industry in all parts than I would about a general business thing just because I study it in school.</p>
</details>

我坚信持续学习，我自己也在这方面投入了大量时间。我认为好奇心是领导力的基本特质，因为它让你成长，而且它也具有感染力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a big believer in continuous learning and I spend a lot of time on that myself. And I think curiosity is a fundamental leadership trait because it allows you to grow, but it also is infectious.</p>
</details>

我的同事们我认为会注意到我花时间学习什么，他们也想学习，这成为公司文化的一部分。我认为一家能够比其他公司学得更快的规模化公司会是一家更好的公司。所以，这会产生连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, people who work with me, I think, notice what I spend time learning and they want to learn and that becomes part of the culture of the company. And I think a company at scale that can learn faster than others is going to be a better company. So, um, there's a trickle down to that.</p>
</details>

此外，我热爱学习，所以我经常在科学会议上提出详细问题，这让人们感到惊讶。我提前阅读，我没有基本的生物学基础，但我学到了很多与我们业务科学高度相关的少数几件事，我喜欢这样做。我认为这帮助我们表现得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And plus, I love learning, so I I often I think surprise people when I'm sitting in scientific meetings asking detailed questions. I read ahead. I don't know, I don't have a fundamental biology basis, but I learn a lot about a few things, uh, that are highly relevant to our business scientifically, and I enjoy that, and I think that's helped us uh, perform better.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您如何将这种学习文化渗透到组织中？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you permeate that culture of learning into the organization?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我认为，就像许多规模化的事物一样，它涉及方方面面。但在我的职业生涯中，我注意到一件事，无论是领导我们在中国的业务，还是在我职业生涯早期领导一个更小的团队，作为CEO，我们能做很多有意识的事情，但这些并不总是产生最大影响的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you know, like a lot of things that scale, it's a it's a little bit of everything. But one of the things I've noticed in my career, um, whether it be leading a bus like our operation in China or even a smaller group earlier in my career as the CEO, is um, we can do a lot of things intentionally, but um, those aren't the always the things that make the biggest difference.</p>
</details>

我认为人们关注另外两件事：你的日常习惯是什么？文化不是幻灯片上的内容，也不是大厅里的文字，而是人们实际做了什么。人们会注意到领导者的行为，尤其是在压力之下领导者的行为。当事情出错时，你会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think people pay attention in two other things. What are your daily habits? And the culture is not what's on the slide or, you know, the words in the lobby. It's what people do. And people notice what leaders do, and they particularly notice what leaders do when they're under pressure. You know, what is, when things are going wrong, what do you do?</p>
</details>

所以，我认为拥有那种好奇的心态，就像我的朋友萨蒂亚·纳德拉（Satya Nadella）所说，是一种“求知型”而非“全知型”的文化，这是那些间接影响公司的事情之一。我认为这也让工作变得快乐。所以，这是我们在礼来公司根深蒂固的东西，可能在我来之前就已经存在了，但我们一直在延续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think having that curious mindset, you know, as Satya Nadella, my friend says, is, you know, a learn it all versus know-it-all kind of culture, um, is one of those indirect things that flows through the company. And I think it also makes work joyful to me, uh, so you know, that that's something that we bed here at Lilly and probably have well before I got here, but but have continued.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么，戴维·里克在压力之下会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does uh, David Ricks do when he's under pressure?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我会加速。我们在这里谈论过这一点。我的意思是，我认为把所有事实摆在桌面上很重要，但采取一些紧急行动也很重要。没有选择也是一种选择。我认为行动很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I drive speed. You've talked about that here. I mean, I think, um, getting all the facts on the table are important, but then acting with some emergency is important. Um, no choice is a choice, um, and I think moving is important.</p>
</details>

我认为倾听也很重要。我非常重视直接的知识。所以，很多时候，我的同事会感到沮丧，因为我会要求与实际做事情的人交谈，在最基本的层面上。通常这些人对他们的任务非常具体，但我真的想知道发生了什么以及为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I think it's important also to hear. I really value the direct knowledge. And so quite often, um, people who work with me get frustrated because I'll ask to talk to the people actually doing the thing, um, at the most basic level. And um, often those people are, they're very specific on their test, but I kind of, I really want to know what's happening and why.</p>
</details>

然后，我认为在前进之前获得外部视角很重要，我经常花时间在这上面。我认为对于CEO来说尤其如此，我们必须听取很多外部声音。我在这上面花了很多时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then, you know, I think it's important to get an outside perspective before you move forward. And often I'll spend time. I think particular for CEOs, we have to a lot of outside voices, um, and I spent a lot of time on that.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您提到了萨蒂亚·纳德拉（Satya Nadella），他曾上过这个播客，我们推荐您收听。但另一个人是Adobe的CEO，您是他的董事会成员，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but you know, you mentioned Satya Nadella, who, uh, you know, has been on the podcast and we recommend you to listen to that. But another one is the CEO of Adobe, where you on the board, yeah.</p>
</details>

**David:** 尚塔努·纳拉延（Shantanu Narayen），他是我很好的朋友。我加入那个董事会的原因之一就是我非常尊敬他。当我还是一个新CEO，刚加入另一家公司的董事会时，对我来说最重要的事情之一就是在董事会会议室里学习，甚至在会议室之外，向一位经验丰富的人学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shantanu Narayen, he's a good friend of mine. And one of the reasons I joined that board is I have so much respect for him. And when I was a new CEO, just and joining another company board, one of the most important things to me was learning in the boardroom, especially bit even outside of that, from a veteran.</p>
</details>

尚塔努当时已经担任那个职位大约九年了。有趣的是，在美国模式中，我们更多地是董事长和CEO兼任。但我刚上任时，我更适合做CEO，而不是董事长。我真的从未管理过董事会，也从未在董事会中花太多时间。他真的在很多方面帮助了我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Shantanu had been in that uh, seat for about nine years at the time. And one of the it's interesting, you know, in the US model, we we have more of a chair CEO combo roles, but that I was much more equipped to be a CEO than a chair when I got that job, um, and I really had never run a board or spent much time in one, um, and he really helped me with that in in a lot of ways.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您从Adobe学到了什么其他东西，并将其付诸实施？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the other things you've learned from Adobe, which you have implemented?</p>
</details>

**David:** 技术节奏以及技术通过持续改进驱动业务价值的方式。我们这个行业更多的是潮汐般的改进，你知道，这些巨大的阶梯式进步。我们谈到了GLP-1，这显然是制药行业的一波巨大的创新浪潮。技术也有这些，就像我们最近在人工智能领域看到的那样，但它们也非常擅长通过大量渐进式的胜利，并且以月和周而不是年来衡量节奏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tech cadence and the way tech drives business value through continuous improvement. Our industry is more about these tidal wave improvements, you know, these big step functions. We talked about GLP-1, which is obviously a mega, um, kind of innovation wave in in the pharmaceutical sector. Tech has those too, but like we've seen recently with AI, but they also are very good at grinding out lots of incremental wins and doing it at a cadence that is measured in months and weeks, not years.</p>
</details>

我认为这是制药行业可以真正学习的东西。有时渐进式的改进会创造巨大的价值。我们没有为自己设定好，我们的车轮在之前谈到的10到14年的时钟上转动，而不是在六个月的时钟上。所以我们尝试做一些这样的事情，无论是药店里购买的产品本身，还是其他一些外围产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's something pharma could really learn from. Sometimes incremental improvements create a lot of value, um, and we don't set ourselves up. Our wheel is turning on that 10 to 14-year clock we talked about earlier, not on the six-month, um, so we've tried to do some of those things both with the product itself that you buy at the pharmacy, but also some of the old other tangential products.</p>
</details>

一个很好的例子是您从获得我们药物中获得的服务。你知道，我们已经在美国以及现在其他四个市场建立了一个直接药房模式，所以我们直接向消费者销售。我们为什么要这样做？因为人们会将这种体验归因于药物本身。所以我们可以用不同的方式进行创新，因为它不是一种药物，一种实体的东西，而是一种数字产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A good example of that is is the service you get from procuring our medicine. Um, you know, we've stood up in the US and now four other markets a direct pharmacy model, so we're selling directly to consumers. And why are we doing that? Because that's actually people attribute that experience to the medicine as well. So we can innovate in a different way because it's not a medicine, a physical thing, it's a digital product, um, and I think that's helping change our company in important ways.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这个想法是通过与技术合作伙伴的一些合作而产生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that's an idea that came came to us through through some of the work with the tech partners.</p>

<p class="english-text">What are the other ways you can get higher tech cadence into a large company?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，我认为首先要更具适应性，对吧？你知道，技术公司的一个特点是，因为它们没有实体产品，它们改变的是比特而不是原子，所以它们可以以不同的速度移动，因为软件就是这样工作的。我们的系统越是软件化，我们就能越快地进行更改，而不是依赖硬件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think being being more able to begin with, right? So, you know, one of the things about tech companies is that because they don't have a physical product, they're changing bits, not atoms. They can move at a different speed because that's how that's how software works. The more software enabled our systems are actually the faster we can make changes versus hardware enabled.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是一个关键的见解。你知道，我认为这方面的例子可能是在我们的生产系统中。大约十年前，我们开始转向更加数字化控制和多模式控制的生产系统，而不是固定的操作。所以我们现在可以通过软件对输入部件、工艺设计、监管要求进行更改，而不是实际物理地重新配置生产线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think that's a key insight. And um, you know, I think examples of that could be like in our production systems. About 10 years ago, we started moving to a much more digitally controlled and um, kind of more multimodal control of our production systems versus fixed kind of operations. So we can make changes to input parts, to process design, to regulatory requirements through software now, uh, not by actually reconfiguring physically lines.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个重要类型的例子。或者，假设我们50%的临床前实验室实验都是通过计算机模拟而非湿实验室进行的预测，我们也可以更快地进行这些操作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's an important type of example of that. Or if let's just say we get to 50% of our pre-clinical laboratory experiments are predictive in silico, not in wet lab, we can make those moves much more quickly as well.</p>
</details>

所以他们有一个内在的优势，因为他们工作在比特而非原子的世界里。我们越能转向比特，情况就越好。话虽如此，一个基于原子的业务拥有更大的护城河，因为你的竞争对手也面临着同样棘手的难题，即制造实体产品，扩大规模，使其在物理世界中发挥作用。我们不会放弃这一点，这实际上是我们的核心战略优势，但我认为将两者结合起来可能会非常强大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they have a built-in advantage because they work in the world of atoms, not bits or bits, not atoms. The more we get to bits, the better. That said, a business based on atoms is has a bigger moat, right? Because your competitors also have those same sticky, difficult problems to make physical products, to scale them, to make them work in the physical world. We're not abandoning that. That's actually our core strategic advantage, but I think combining the two could be super powerful.</p>
</details>

然后，还有一种文化因素，即来自软件的期望，这是一种令人难以置信的紧迫感，因为你随时可能被取代。我认为有时制药公司会有点自满，因为我们所做的事情很难被取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there's a cultural piece about expectations that comes from software, which is this incredible sense of urgency because you can just get displaced at any moment, um, and I think sometimes pharma companies get a little complacent because it's hard to displace what we do.</p>
</details>

### 药企的伦理困境：可负担性与利润

**Nicola:** 谈到定价，您在可负担性与利润之间面临的最困难的伦理困境是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to um, pricing. What is the most difficult ethical dilemma you are facing when it comes to affordability versus profits?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，我认为我们的业务中存在许多伦理困境，因为健康是如此个人化，而且存在普遍医疗保健的理念。这是一个核心问题，但还有其他问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think we have many ethical dilemmas in our business because health is so personal. And there is an ethos around universal healthcare. This is a core one. There are others too, I would say.</p>
</details>

创新者应该获得怎样的公平回报？我认为这其中存在一些限制。一种观点（我们不采纳）是“市场能承受多少就定价多少”。我认为这可能跨越了医疗系统中许多参与者的伦理底线，我们实际上并不以这种方式定价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um, what is a fair return for an innovator? And I think there's H brackets on that. Um, one perspective, which had been pursued by the industry, we don't pursue, is that, you know, it's what the market will bear. I I think that probably steps across ethical lines for many actors in the health system system, and we we actually don't pursue pricing that way.</p>
</details>

但你可以想象，绝望的人需要药物才能生存，你可能会陷入真正 exorbitant 的价格点，也许能获得短期回报，但如果你永远追求这种方式，你可能会被立法或被起诉而破产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you can imagine desperate people who are um, need a medicine to survive, um, you can get into uh, price points that are really exorbitant, um, and maybe make a short-term return, but you'll probably be either legislated or um, um, sued out of business if you pursue that forever.</p>
</details>

你知道，在另一个极端，有边际成本加成，即考虑所有投入成本，包括研发，然后在此基础上增加一些。但我认为这未能考虑到我们业务中的风险，与许多其他成熟业务相比，这些风险非常大。正如您所知，这些风险的回报必须是可观的，因为事情可能会出错，而且它们不会很快出错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, there's on the other spectrum, there's a marginal cost plus take all input costs including research and we'll add something to it. But I think the the risks that fails to account for the risks in our business, which are very significant compared to other um, established businesses, and the the return on that risk, as you would know, needs to be substantial because um, things can go wrong. They don't go wrong quickly.</p>
</details>

所以，我们在解释这一点时遇到的问题是，尼古拉，它看起来好像明天、后天、大后天一切都很好。它们慢慢地出错，然后突然之间，这就是我们面临的专利周期问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the problem we have in explaining that, Nikolai, is is it just seems like everything's okay tomorrow and the next day and the next day. Um, they go wrong slowly and then all of a sudden, and that's the patent cycle problem we faced, right?</p>
</details>

一旦一种药物被证明有效并广泛分发，帮助了数百万人，这时就会出现“哦，成本加成”的论点。但我们一开始就不会有这种药物，因为没有人会承担发明它的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So once a drug has been proven and is widely distributed and is helping millions of people, that's when those arguments come in of, "Oh, cost plus." But we wouldn't have had the thing to begin with because no one would have undertaken the risks to invent it.</p>
</details>

我们更倾向于价值导向的方法。它在医疗保健系统中取代了其他哪些成本？当然，我们应该为此获得认可。然后，在此之外还能创造什么价值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We pursue more of a value approach. What is the displacement of other costs in the healthcare system? Certainly we deserve credit for that. And then what is the value creation beyond that that that can occur?</p>
</details>

你知道，例如，我们的减重药物有新的证据表明，当人们服用它们时，工作场所的缺勤率会下降。这可能是因为酒精消费减少或其他健康因素。还有一些间接因素，比如关节和膝盖疼痛减轻，所以使用我们药物的人群中髋关节置换和膝关节置换手术的速度正在放缓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, for instance, with our weight loss drugs, there's emerging evidence that absenteeism drops in the workplace when people are on them. Maybe that's because reduced alcohol consumptions or other health factors. There's indirect things like joint and knee pain drop, so hip replacements and knee replacements are slowing in populations using our drugs.</p>
</details>

嗯，我们可能也应该为此获得一些认可。所以，你知道，我们的想法是，我们在专利期内捕获我们创造的一些（但不是全部）直接和间接价值。然后我们提醒政策制定者，我们行业最伟大的礼物之一是，我们所追求的一切，我们所发明的一切，对我们来说都归零，而对社会来说则无限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we probably should get some credit for that as well. So, you know, our idea is that we capture some, not all, of the direct and indirect value we create during the patent period. And then we remind policy makers that one of the great gifts of our industry is that everything we pursue, everything we invent, goes to zero for us and goes to infinity for society.</p>
</details>

因为仿制药对医疗保健系统来说是如此划算。我们40年前发明了**百忧解**（Prozac），它是全球治疗重度抑郁症的标准药物。在主要市场，它每天的成本约为四到五美分，几乎是免费的。我认为这是对社会的一份巨大礼物。我们不声称我们不直接为此邀功，但我认为我们应该在专利方面获得更多认可，因为有这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because generic drugs are such a great deal for health care systems. We invented Prozac, you know, 40 years ago. It's a standard of care globally for treating major depressive disorder. It costs in major markets about four or five cents a day. It's virtually free. And I think that's a tremendous gift to society. We don't claim we don't want credit uh, for that directly, but we I think deserve more credit on patent because of that.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 那么现在，您和我在实验室里，我们发现了GLP-1，我们非常高兴，对吧？我们意识到这将导致更少的人缺勤，更少的酒精中毒，以及所有这些。那么，当我们决定如何定价时，谁会坐在桌旁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now you and I, we come out of the lab, we've discovered GP-1, we we're pretty pleased, right? Uh, and we realize that this is going to lead to less people being away from the jobs, less alcoholism, all that kind of thing. Now, who's around the table when we decide how to price it?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我的意思是，这是一个演进的过程，但我们从外部开始。我们直接与医疗系统交谈，了解他们的想法。我们查看我们的数据集。所以，在我们走出实验室之前，桌旁的人会问：这种药物能做什么？我们如何以全面的方式分析性地捕捉这些益处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it's an evolutionary process, but we begin with the outside in. We talk to health systems directly and understand how they think about it. We look at at our data sets. So around the table before we walk out of the labs is, "Well, what could this medicine do and how do we in a full way try to capture analytically those benefits?"</p>
</details>

有时我们能很好地预测这些事情。在GLP-1或肠促胰素（incretin）的情况下，我们做得不太好，因为我们低估了这些药物的广泛益处。所以我们查看真实世界的证据，并反向推导。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And sometimes we do a good job of predicting those things. In the case of GLP-1s or incretin, we've not done a great job because we undershot, I think, the broad benefits of these medicines. So then we look at real world evidence and work backwards.</p>
</details>

两周前，我们参与了美国**退伍军人事务部**（Veterans Administration）的一项重要研究，该研究调查了所有这些非代谢因素，并显示出对精神分裂症、重度抑郁症、酒精中毒等方面的益处。然后我们量化这些益处，并问自己，我们创造的价值中，公平的份额是多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was an important study we were part of at the Veterans Administration in the US that came out two weeks ago that looked at all these non-metabolic factors and showed benefits for, you know, schizophrenia, for major depressive disorder, for alcoholism, etcetera. And so then we quantify that and then, you know, we we ask ourselves, "What's a fair share of the value we've created?"</p>
</details>

其中一些价值是相当确定的，另一些则是概率性的，所以我们对此进行估算，并以此形成价格观点。所以，财务人员、科学人员和与客户沟通的人员都会在场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of these values are quite certain, some of them are, uh, probabilistic, and so we make estimates about that and we try to form a price perspective that way. So financial people are there, scientific people are there, and people who talk to customers are there.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 你们谈论人们缺勤。我们服用比以前更多的药物，在某种程度上比以前更健康，但病假却在增加，对吧？在这个国家，我认为我们正在达到7%。为什么当我们变得更健康时，病假却在增加？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There talking about people being away from from work. So we take more medicine than before. We are in a way more healthy than before, but yet, um, sickness leave is just going up, right? In this country, it's I think we are hitting 7%. Why why is sickness leave going up when we are becoming healthier?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，我对此没有明确的答案。我认为当您谈论您的国家挪威时，您指的是7%吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I don't have a a clear answer for that. I think in when you're talking about your country Norway, is that what you're talking about the 7%?</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**David:** 在美国，新冠疫情期间这个数字大幅上升，现在似乎有所下降。但很多专家指出的一点是心理健康。所以，虽然我们在解决身体健康方面比以往任何时候都做得更好，大多数国家的预期寿命都在上升（美国是一个例外，如果您愿意，我们可以谈谈），即使在肥胖率上升的背景下也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the US, it's it's it rose a lot during COVID. It seems to be coming down a little bit now. But one thing a lot of experts point to is mental health. So, um, while we we are better at addressing physical health than ever before, life expectancy in most countries is rising. The US is an exception. We can talk about that if you'd like, even with the background Rising obesity rates.</p>
</details>

所以我想如果我们把肥胖剔除，它们会上升得更快，因为当我们能够大规模使用这些药物时，心血管风险肯定会大幅降低。但人们花更多时间独处，花更多时间在屏幕前。我们作为一个物种，独处和在屏幕前可能并不更健康。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think if we took obesity out of that, they'd be rising even faster because cardiovascular risk will certainly be reduced dramatically when we can use these medicines at scale. But people are spending more time alone. They're spending more time in front of screens. We probably are not a healthier species for being alone and in front of screens.</p>
</details>

尤其是在年轻人中，我认为我们必须非常担心这种趋势。即使在工作场所，我们也更多地独处在屏幕前。我认为这是一个问题。我们可以谈谈现在世界上正在发生的“重返工作岗位”的氛围，但我认为这样做的主要原因之一是为了拥有一个心理健康的劳动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um, particularly in young people, we have to worry, I think, a lot about this trend, um, and even in the workplace, we're alone in in front of screens more.

And we could talk about the back to work kind of vibe that's going on in the world now, but, um, I think one of the main reasons to do that is to have a a mentally healthy workforce.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您会如何描述礼来的企业文化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How would you describe the corporate culture at Eli Lilly?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，我们谈到了好奇心，我认为这是核心标志。作为一个科学驱动的组织，这长期以来一直是我们的精神。我认为这是一个有趣的地方，因为我们对技术问题也有非常高的严谨标准。但大多数从其他公司来这里工作的人都形容我们非常人道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we talked about curiosity. I think that's a core hallmark. And as a scientifically driven organization, has been in our our ethos for a long time. And I think it is an interesting place because we have also a very high rigor standard on technical matters. But most people who come to work here from other companies describe us as very humanistic.</p>
</details>

这既体现在我们思考我们生产的产品（当然是在医疗保健领域，这是一种非常人性化的体验），也体现在我们彼此之间。人们谈论“礼来友好”（Lilly nice），我认为我们对礼貌和尊重有非常高的标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As well, both in thinking about the products we make, which of course are in healthcare, and that's a very human experience, but also with each other.

</details>

**Nicola:** 那么我如何才能看到这一点呢？如果我现在来拜访您，在走廊里走动，会有什么样的感觉？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how would I so how would I how would I see that? So now I'm come to visit you and I walk around in the corridors. What's the kind of uh, what's the feeling?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，您可能会走进一个会议室，看到人们正在激烈地辩论数据集、统计分析方法、生产产出数字或财务目标，但同时他们不会提高嗓门。在周末，他们可能会在孩子们踢足球的比赛中并肩而坐，因为我们住在一个小城市。所以有很多亲切感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you might jump into a meeting room and see people vigorously debating uh, data sets or statistical analysis methods on something or manufacturing output numbers or a financial goal. And at the same time, not raising their voices. And um, in the weekends, you know, going to a football match for their kids next to each other because we're in a small city. So there's a lot of cordiality.</p>
</details>

这并不完美。我并不是说这些事情对我来说是一个很好的工作场所，但我认为它带来了一个重要的优势，那就是团队合作。我认为随着公司规模的扩大，最困难的事情之一就是对抗官僚主义。官僚主义的核心是什么？它是建立起来的系统和流程，它们本应完成工作，却阻碍了工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's that's not perfect. I'm not those are very not those things to me make for a great place to work, but and I think it it compels one important advantage I should talk about, which is teamwork. So I think as company scale, one of the most um, difficult things to fight is bureaucracy. And what is that at its core? It's the building up of systems and processes that get in the way of the work when they were designed to do the work.</p>
</details>

在这里，我认为我们有一个很好的方法来克服这一点，那就是人际关系。这既包括我们员工的资历和任期，也包括这种“可以和任何人交谈”的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here, I think we have a good way to cut through that, which is relationships, both with the longevity and tenure of our employees and this feeling of, "It's okay to talk to anybody."</p>
</details>

你知道，在我来这次采访的路上，有七八个人在自助餐厅和我说话，当时我正在拿咖啡，他们只是问我今天过得怎么样，问一些业务上的事情等等。这不是一个CEO像一个可怕的人，你不敢和他说话的地方，其他人也不是。我也会和人们交谈，问他们正在做什么，这有什么有趣之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, on my way to this interview, seven or eight people talked to me in the cafeteria when I picked up my cup of coffee and just ask how my day was going, ask about a business matter, etcetera. This isn't a place where the CEO is like a scary person you don't speak to, and neither is anyone else. And I talk to people like, "What are you working on?" And "How is that interesting?"</p>
</details>

这样很好。但这种亲切感，这种尊重和开放感，有时可能只是一种表面现象。有时冲突对于产生新的见解和结果也很重要。在我任职期间，我们试图以结构化的方式引入这一点，比如我们能否有冲突？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it's good that way. But one of the things that cordial, that sort of sense of respect and openness can have is sometimes it can just be a surface thing, and that sometimes conflict can be important to produce new insights and results. And that's something in my tenure we've tried to introduce in a structured way, is like, "Can we have conflict?"</p>
</details>

我们通过一些小技巧来实现这一点，比如在会议中任命“魔鬼代言人”，以及，尼古拉，我们最重要的决策之一是何时从开发的中期阶段进入三期临床。当我们这样做时，您提到了30亿美元，其中三分之二的成本是最后一步。所以当我们决定前进时，我们最好成功。

<p class="english-text">And we do it through little gimmicks like appointing devil advocate in in meetings and having, um, like one one of our most important decisions, Nikolai, is when we decide to go from phase to the middle phase of development to phase three. When we do that, you mentioned the $3 billion, two-thirds of that cost is the last step. So when we go, we better succeed.</p>
</details>

我们实际上有一个结构化的流程，你会指派一个团队充当反对者，基本上要驳倒支持者提出的所有推进论点。他们会把这些写下来，所以决策者会被迫阅读并考虑不同的观点。但这些对我们来说是较新的事物。我认为过去我们对彼此过于友好，犯了错误，这降低了我们的生产力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And we actually have a structured process where you assign a team to be a contrarian to basically defeat every argument the proponents are making to advance.

And I think in the past, um, we've been, I think, too nice to each other and made mistakes and it's made us less productive.</p>

**Nicola:** 对抗官僚主义的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the key to fighting bureaucracy?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我想我提到了一个，我认为是人际关系，以及让组织结构图和流程为你服务，而不是阻碍你。它阻碍你的方式是人们只遵循这些东西，对吧？在某种程度上，它应该是解决有机问题和自我组织的后备方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I mentioned one. I think relationships and getting down to, um, making the org chart and the process work for you, not against you. And the way it can work against you is people only go to those things, right? In a way, it should be the back up to organic problem solving and, uh, self-organization.</p>
</details>

我的一个习惯是，当人们向我升级问题时（这些年来他们越来越少这样做），我会问他们已经做了什么来与他们的同事解决问题。通常人们对此没有很好的答案。我认为在大公司里，领导者喜欢解决问题，这可能就是我们获得工作的方式，对吧？我们是解决问题最出色的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of my habits is when people escalate to me, which they do less and less, uh, over the years, is I ask them what they've done already to solve the problem with their peer. And often people don't have a good answer to that. And I think in big companies, leaders like to problem solve. It's probably how we got our jobs, right? Is we were the best one at fixing things.</p>
</details>

在某种程度上，领导力可能是一个模糊而充满挑战的领域。我发现自己是一个问题解决者。当人们来找我，说“哦，这行不通，我们怎么解决它？”时，我本能地想帮助他们。但从某种意义上说，如果问题只有在向上汇报时才能解决，那就会产生官僚主义。这是一种等级森严的官僚主义的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in a way, leadership can be an amorphous kind of challenging space to sit in. And I find myself, I'm a problem solver. I I I kind of when people come to me like, "Oh, this isn't working, how do we fix it?" I feel myself instinctively wanting to help them. But in a way that creates bureaucracy if if things only get solved when they go up. That's a kind of definition of hierarchical bureaucracy.</p>
</details>

所以我们必须对抗自己的冲动。官僚主义公司的领导者往往是最满意的人，而不是其中的员工。我认为情况应该反过来。我认为领导者应该担心混乱和事物运作的有机性不足，也许对结果满意，但有点担心他们看不到和不知道一切。我认为这对我来说和公司来说会是一个更好的状态，而不是知道一切并解决所有问题，那肯定会次优。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have to fight against our own impulses, um, and the the fact that bureaucratic companies often the most satisfied person is the leader of it, not the people in it.

Maybe satisfied with the results, but a little uh, concerned they don't see and know everything. I think that would be a better state for me than and the company than than knowing everything and solving every problem that surely will sub optimize lowly.</p>

### 领导力成长与速度心态

**Nicola:** 您现在是比年轻时更好的领导者吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you a better leader now than when you were younger?</p>

<p class="english-text">In what way are you still young, young and all that, but I mean, in what ways?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，我感觉自己很年轻，但我的孩子们指出我不再年轻了。但我认为在我的职业生涯中有两个阶段，我相信许多顶尖组织的人都遇到过，它们确实是“顿悟时刻”。第一个是当你从我刚才谈到的管理团队、成为经理的角色，转变为以你为中心、其他人为分支的管理方式时。然后你得到一份工作，其规模不再支持这种方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I I feel young, but my kids point out I'm not young. Um, but I think probably there's two steps in my career that I'm sure many people at the top organizations have come up against that were really like aha moments. The first one is when you move from a version of what I just spoke about being sort of running a team, being a manager, we all get to that, but then you running the management in a way where you're the hub and those the people are the spokes. And then you get to a job where the scale of it no longer supports that.</p>
</details>

你基本上意识到你的工作实际上是帮助人们，有时是你的下属经理，有时是前线人员实际完成工作，并创造一个让他们更成功的环境。你需要关注目标的清晰度，而不是亲自实现目标；关注为团队配备能够高效协作的人员，而不是纠正他们的个人行为。

<p class="english-text">Where basically you realize your job is actually to help people, sometimes the managers underneath you, sometimes the people on the front line actually do the work and create an environment where they can be more successful.

On staffing the team with people who can function at high level together, um, not correcting their individual behaviors.</p>
</details>

你知道，对我来说，这发生在我第一次担任总经理时，我负责加拿大市场，这对我们来说是一个中等规模的市场。第一年我试图自己解决所有问题，我们没有达到目标，我的大多数团队成员对我非常沮丧，我也对自己很沮丧。

And, you know, we we both like were doing their end of- year review and we agreed neither of us were successful. And that was like Epiphany for me, is like, "I need to make fundamental changes."</p>
</details>

第二个顿悟发生在我担任这个职位之前，我负责礼来公司的一个重要部门。我意识到高级管理层的大部分价值创造都在公司之外，在于真正理解你的组织在世界中的位置，并帮助公司根据这一点调整其努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second one was when I got to the job before this. I was running a big part of Lilly. And I realized that a lot of the value creation at senior management is outside the company. Is really understanding where your organization fits in the world and being and and helping the company refine its effort against that.</p>
</details>

我认为内部人员想做很多事情，因为他们认为这些事情很好，但实际上世界只重视你做的少数几件事。当然，我们必须做很多活动才能产生那少数几件事。但将你的力量集中在一个箭头后面，就像一个关键的战略选择行为，只有当你处于高级职位时才真正可能。你需要花更多的时间在这上面，比你想象的还要多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think inside people want to do a lot of things because they think they're good, but actually the world only values a few things that you do. And of course, we have to do many activities to to produce those few things. But lining up kind of your wood behind one arrowhead is like a key act of strategic choice, but is really only possible when you're in a senior position. And you need to spend more time on that than you think.</p>
</details>

这令人沮丧，因为你必须筛选掉很多无关紧要的对话才能达到这一点。但你可以形成自己的观点，如果你能真正看到如何通过专注来为客户和社会创造价值并取得成功，那就会产生巨大的影响。我认为这也是我试图带到这份工作中的另一件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's frustrating because you have to sift through a lot of conversations that don't matter to get to that. But, um, you can form an opinion about that and make a big difference if you can really see how you can win and produce value for customers and and society by focusing. And I think that's that's something else I've tried to take into this job.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您谈到的许多事情都涉及到速度，以及时间表等等。速度是一种心态吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many of the things you talked about involves um, speed, um, and kind of time schedules and so on. Is speed a mindset?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, for sure.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您如何培养它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you work on it?</p>
</details>

**David:** 嗯，这是一种领导者的心态。我认为我所接受并与我的团队讨论的一点是，在我们这样复杂的业务中，管理层可以影响的事情，比如跨学科、长达十年的开发周期、高度监管等等，我们选择移动的速度是管理层的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a mindset for leadership. And I think one of the things I embraced and talked to my team about is of the things that we can affect as management in a complicated business like ours, multi-disciplinary, decade long development cycles, highly regulated, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, the speed at which we choose to move is is a choice of management.</p>
</details>

这是我们设定的目标，我们创造的文化，我们对完美的容忍度。所以我们可以在不完美的情况下做出选择，这些都是我们可以利用的杠杆，可以加快一点速度。在很多方面，那些被认为是缓慢的公司，我认为我们首先应该审视公司的领导层。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's how what objectives we set, the culture we create, are decision tolerance for perfection. So we can make choices without perfection. Those are all three levels levers we can pull and go a little bit faster. And in many ways, companies that are seen as slow, I would say the first place we should look as is at the leadership of the company.</p>
</details>

所以对我来说，这是一个可以用来创造价值的杠杆，几乎总是有效，而且主要取决于管理层。改变太快可能存在危险。我们之前谈到药物开发，我们进行了四到五年的变革管理过程，所以我们在加速的同时没有破坏事物。我们以有条不紊的方式改变了我们的业务流程来开发药物，但目标是速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so to me, it's it's a it's a lever you can pull to create value that almost always works and is mostly a function of management. Changing things too fast can be a danger. Um, it's we talked about drug development earlier, and we we undertook a four or five-year change management process, so we didn't break things as we sped up. That we did them, we we we changed our business process to develop drugs in a methodical way, but with a goal on speed.</p>
</details>

重要的是，当我们这样做时，我们真正地专注于团队，因为人们可能会说：“好吧，我们一开始的目标是将药物开发时间缩短一半。”当我们第一次宣布这个目标时，礼来团队看着它说：“你们疯了，我们会伤害别人，我们会冒犯监管机构，我们可能再也生产不出新药了，这会把事情搞砸。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And importantly, when we did it, we really focus the teams because people can say, "Okay, we did have a goal at the start to cut drug development time in half." And when we first announced that, the Lilly teams looked at that and said, "You guys are crazy. We're going to hurt people. We're we're going to offend regulators. We may never produce a new drug again. You know, like this will break things."</p>
</details>

但有趣的是，真正改变的是，我认为拥有那些所谓的“大胆而有挑战性的目标”很重要，因为如果你从10%的目标开始，你最终会达到8%左右。所以，我认为如果我们真的想达到目标，我们需要一些长期的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But interestingly, what actually changed, I think it is important to have those so-called, you know, hairy and audacious goals, um, to really because if you start with a 10% goal, you get to eight or something, you know. So I think if we really were going to get there, we needed something long-term.</p>
</details>

但我们采纳的渐进式改变理念基本上是“超越上次”，即使只是一点点。举个例子，我们过去从获得三期临床结果到向第一个监管机构提交申请大约需要半年时间。而我们上次创纪录（去年，针对肥胖症的**Zepbound**）的时间是以天来衡量的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the incremental change philosophy we adopted was basically to beat the last time, even if it was just by 1%. So an example is like, it used to take us about half a year from when we got a phase three result to submit to the first regulator. And the last time we set a record, which was last year, on on Zepbound for obesity, um, it was measured in days.</p>
</details>

所以我们将这个过程压缩了80%以上。但我们并不是通过说“从流程中削减80%”来做到这一点。我们是在四到五年内通过说“公司的新目标是比上次团队移动得最快”来实现的。所以如果有人在180天内完成了，如果他们做了120天，那就是所有人的新目标。然后人们都想超越它，因为他们想成为最好的。这创造了一种积极的、不断进步的持续改进心态，我认为这对于大规模推动变革非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we compressed that process by 80 plus percent. But we did not do it by saying, "Cut 80% out of the process." We we did it over the course of four or five years by saying, "The new goal for the company is the fastest the last team moved." That the last team moved. And so if someone if it was 180 days, if they did 120, that was the new goal for everyone. And then people wanted to beat it because they wanted to be the best. And it created this positive kind of always getting better continuous improvement mindset that I think was super helpful and driving change at scale, uh, in time.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 非常有趣。一个快速的问题，您在开头提到您更像一个CEO而不是董事长。您可能知道，我们主张董事长和CEO不应该是同一个人。您为什么认为我们错了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very interesting. Um, quick question. You uh, you mentioned um, um, you in the beginning being about a CEO than chair. Uh, you may know we advocate that the chair and the CEO should not be the same person. Why why do you think we are wrong on that?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我认为，成功的公司有这两种模式。我不会预先判断一种结构，其中一些可能与具体情境、行业和个人有关。实际上，我认识一些CEO可能不应该担任董事长，而一些CEO应该担任董事长而不是CEO。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think look, I think there are successful models, successful companies with both models. I I don't prejudge um, a structure and some of it could be contextual industry and person specific. Actually, I I know some CEOs who probably shouldn't be chairs and some CEOs who should be chairs and not CEOs.</p>
</details>

我相信在我们这个行业，因为我们的时间跨度如此之长，统一这两个角色是有益的。我认为“首席执行官”这个词在执行方面是一个重要的角色，但将其与长期议程结合起来尤为重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I believe in our sector because our time horizon is so long, there are benefits in uniting the role. I think the the pure, you know, the word chief executive officer on execution is an important role, but marrying that to the long-term agenda is particularly important.</p>
</details>

这在许多公司中都行之有效，我们有许多欧洲同行，他们将这两个角色分开，我知道董事长和CEO之间有非常紧密的联系，以确保执行议程与长期议程保持一致。但正如您从投资许多公司中了解到的那样，CEO兼董事长或CEO可能犯的错误之一是牺牲短期利益以换取长期利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It can work and does work in many companies. We have many European peers where they have the role divided, and I know there's a very tight linkage between the chair and the CEO, said that the execution agenda is aligned to the long-term agenda. But as you know, well, from investing in many companies, probably on the list of mistakes CEO chairs or CEOs can make is sacrificing the short-term for the long-term.</p>
</details>

我认为这在像我们这样科学驱动、研发密集型行业中尤其如此。我们今年正在分配资源，本周晚些时候我们将公布我们的研发支出指导，我们正在为2035年至2040年做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's particularly true in a science driven R&D intensive industry like ours. We're allocating resources this year. We'll later this week announce our guidance on R&D spend, and we are solving for 2035 to 2040.</p>
</details>

所以，我可以通过减少长期研发支出来以非常不同的方式推动收益。在那段时间里，这远远超出了我在公司的任期，我不会在那里。但在这里，我认为将这些事情结合起来有助于更好地解决这个问题。它节省了一些与董事会进行时间和议程规划的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I could easily drive earnings in a very differentiated way by reducing R&D spend over the long term. And in that period, it's well beyond my tenure at the company. I won't be here in that period of time. But here, I think uniting those things helps solve that a little better. It saves a little bit of time and agenda planning with the board.</p>
</details>

缺点是，你可能会在一个角色中拥有过多的权力，你需要有补偿性的结构来解决这个问题：强大的其他高管团队成员和一位在董事会中拥有真正影响力的首席独立董事。我们拥有这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the downside is you can end up with too much power in one role, and you need compensating structures for that strong other executive team members and a lead independent director who has real sway in the boardroom. We have those things.</p>
</details>

### 给年轻人的建议

**Nicola:** 最后问几个私人问题。您早上通常几点起床？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, a few personal questions at the end. What you wake up in the morning usually?</p>
</details>

**David:** 通常在5:30到6点之间，取决于我的时区，但在家时是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Usually between 5:30 and 6:00, yeah, and what depending on my time zone, but at home, yeah.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您会做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What you?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我通常会锻炼30分钟。我尝试将有氧运动和力量训练结合起来，并且越来越多地增加了柔韧性训练，所以我现在每周做两次瑜伽，因为我年纪越来越大，我喜欢运动。我所有的爱好都涉及户外活动和运动。所以，当我不能再做这些事的时候，那将是悲伤的一天，我知道那一天总会到来，但我正在努力尽可能地延长它。它也能清醒我的头脑，让我振作起来。然后我喝杯咖啡，读四份报纸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I typically do exercise for 30 minutes, um, I try to mix that up between uh, getting my heart rate up or just uh, resistance. And increasingly, I've added a lot of flexibility, so I started doing like yoga twice a week because I'm getting older and I like to move. Most all my hobbies involve being outside and moving. So, um, it'll be a sad day when I can't do that. I know that'll come someday, but I'm trying to prolong that as long as possible. It also clears my mind and wakes me up a bit. Then I have a cup of coffee and I read four papers.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 除了报纸，您还读什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And apart from papers, what do you read?</p>
</details>

**David:** 我读科学期刊，正如我们谈到的。我通常认为我是一个信奉“T型领导力”的人，即管理公司的横向方面，但通常每季度我都会在一个主题上深入研究，深入到最底层。所以目前我正在努力学习更多关于一些特定人工智能功能的东西，所以我正在阅读并尝试一些可能影响我们行业的模型。如果我有时间，我会在上班前早上阅读这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I read scientific journals, as we talked about. I get typically like, I'm a believer in like what you'd call T-style leadership, so sort of running the horizontal of your company, but usually once a qu, one topic a quarter, I try to go pretty deep on like, go down to the the bare metal, um, and so, um, at the moment, I'm trying to learn a little bit more about, um, some particular AI, uh, features. And so I was reading, um, and playing around with some of the models that are out there that that can affect our industry, um, and I'll read about that in the morning if I have time before going to work.</p>
</details>

最近我读了更多的报纸，因为似乎每晚都有很多新闻发生，所以努力跟上这些。但我会花时间阅读我感兴趣的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After lately, I've been reading more papers because there's a lot of news that seems to be happening every night. So, uh, trying to stay on top of that, but I will take time to read read about a topic of interest to me.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 您读小说吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You read fiction?</p>
</details>

**David:** 只在度假时。我希望我能读，我喜欢为了乐趣而阅读，但我发现到晚上回家时，我已经厌倦了阅读。我大部分时间都在以口头和书面形式处理文字，这确实很累。所以我倾向于花时间陪伴妻子，早睡。有时我会为第二天做一些前期工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Only on vacation. I I wish I could read. I enjoy reading for pleasure, but I find myself tired of reading by the time I get home at the end of the evening. I mostly consume words for a living and uh, verbally and in writing, and it's yeah, it's fatiguing. So I'll tend to spend time with my wife. I go to bed early, um, sometimes I'll do a little pre-work for the next day.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 音乐呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And music?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，我喜欢各种音乐。我有一个兼收并蓄的播放列表。我小时候是打击乐手，年轻时打鼓，当时我喜欢爵士乐，所以我喜欢在工作时听爵士乐，它似乎不会让我分心太多。我也喜欢流行音乐和其他形式的音乐，这是我与孩子们分享的东西。我们有一个持续更新的家庭播放列表，人们可以随时收听，如果你想了解家人的最新想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, love all kinds of music. I have a eclectic playlist. Um, I grew up as a percussionist, playing drums in my my youth, and I enjoyed Jazz at the time, so I I like that when I'm actually and that's a type of music I can listen to when I'm working. It doesn't seem to distract me as much, um, and I enjoy popular music and other forums. That's something I share with my kids. We have a a running family playlist that people curate and you can listen to at any time if you want the latest thoughts from the family.</p>
</details>

所以这是一个我们保持联系的有趣方式。我们的孩子已经离家了，这是一种我们可以保持联系，了解彼此偏好的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's a fun way we stay connected. Our kids are out of the house, and it's a way we can stay, you know, in touch with each other's preferences.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 这很酷。最后一个问题，您对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's cool. And um, last question. What is your advice to young people?</p>
</details>

**David:** 是的，我想说两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, yeah, I think two things I would say. One is, um,</p>
</details>

现在的孩子们长大了，我看着我的孩子们长大，作为父母，拥有很多资源，你会本能地想控制很多事情。我认为如果我将这与我自己的成长方式进行比较，那是非常随意的。我的意思是，我有很多自由时间，我11岁时就有了第一份工作，我是一个送报童，我还经营着一份割草的生意。大多数时候，我的父母都不知道我在哪里，直到晚餐时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kids grow up today, and I've watched my kids grow up, and, you know, impulses as a parent with a lot of resources or to control a lot of things. And I think if I compare that to how I grew up, which was very random. I mean, I think I had a lot of latitude in free time. I had my first job at the of like 11. I was like a paper boy, and I ran a business cutting grass. And most days my parents had no idea where I was until like dinner time.</p>
</details>

而我现在看到我们的孩子有如此多的结构化安排。我为他们成年后，以及他们进入职场后感到担忧。我认为我看到了这种模式，即“让我规划我应该做什么”。我鼓励年轻人对机会保持开放，对惊喜保持开放。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I see just so much structure, uh, for our children now. And I I worry for them as adults, and when they come to the workplace, I think I see this pattern of like, "Let me plan out like what I'm supposed to be doing." And I encourage young people to be open to opportunity and open to surprise.</p>
</details>

一个快速的旁白，我在礼来公司工作了近29年，我加入公司只有一个原因：因为我的妻子在印第安纳大学学医，我需要在印第安纳找一份工作。我来这里并不是为了成为CEO，甚至不是为了进入制药行业。我只是来到这里后爱上了它，我发现我擅长其中的某些部分，而且我认为我做得还不错，并且非常享受我的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh, to quick side story, but like, you know, I'm at Lilly 29 years almost now, and I joined the company for only one reason: because my wife was studying medicine at Indiana University, and I needed a job in Indiana. I I did not come here to be the CEO or even come to the pharmaceutical industry. I just fell in love it with it when I got here, and I found I was good at certain parts of it, and and I think I've done okay and and really enjoyed my career.</p>
</details>

我认为如果我们对事情过于刻板，那些事情就永远不会发生。所以这是一点。第二点实际上是关于面对面的部分，那就是花时间与不同的人共进午餐，了解我们所做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think if we're so scripted about things, those those things will never happen, um, so that's that's one thing. And this the second, um, is actually about the in-person part, is, you know, take time to have lunch with different people and learn about everything we do.</p>
</details>

我认为教育和知识正在以指数级速度扩展，我们通过学校培养了更多的专家，但通才却越来越少。我在通才的部分找到了乐趣，在于连接不同学科之间的点。我认为这对于人们来说很重要，在一个我们有工程师、商科人士、化学家和生物学家的公司里，有如此多的垂直性，连接各个部分很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I think uh, education and knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate, and we're creating more experts through schooling, but fewer generalists. And I find joy in the generalist part, uh, in the connecting the dots between disciplines. And I think it's important for people to just in a company where we have engineers and business people and um, and chemists and biologists, there's so much verticality to that. It's important to connect the parts.</p>
</details>

**Nicola:** 这些都是很棒的建议。我认为您做得远不止“还不错”，您取得了巨大的成功，谢谢您。您的公司创造了一些令人难以置信的东西。恭喜您留在印第安纳，那对您来说无疑是正确的选择。非常感谢您加入我们，请继续努力！

But big thanks for joining us and uh, please keep up the good work.</p>
