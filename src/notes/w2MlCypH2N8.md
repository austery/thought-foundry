### 引言：投资哲学的多元视角

主持人：非常荣幸能邀请到四位嘉宾——Greg、Howard、Jean 和 Patrick。今天的会议以如此精彩的方式开场，真是令人难以置信。非常感谢大家。现在，Jean 和 Patrick 也加入了我们，我们将进一步深入讨论。如果我在任何时候打断了各位，请大家多多包涵，这只是为了充分利用大家慷慨给予我们的时间。Jean，我将从您开始。Greg 和 Howard 已经阐述了他们的投资哲学以及建立投资信条的必要性。您管理着 **Wellington**（一家全球知名的投资管理公司），它被视为一个由投资精品店组成的联邦。那么，不拥有一个 overarching（总括性）投资哲学，其优势和潜在的陷阱分别是什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">it is such a privilege to have the four of you with us today Greg Howard what a way to start this conference today that was incredible thank you so much we are now joined by Jin and Patrick and we'll aim to take the discussion further so if I interrupt any of you please bear with me this is just to make the most of the time that you have kindly given us Jin I'll start with you so Greg and Howard uh runner through their investment philosophy and the need for an investment Creed you run Wellington uh which can be seen as a Federation of investment boutiques what are really the advantages and the pitfalls of not having to have an overarching investment philosophy?</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：谢谢。也感谢大家分享的真知灼见，那真的非常引人入胜。当我坐在那里聆听时，我想到，正如您所说，我们大约有 60 个团队，我们并非由一个总括性的哲学和流程来组织。我想，我们总括性的哲学和流程是：我们相信哲学和流程对于投资团队至关重要。我们大约有 60 个团队，其中一些团队的成员今天也在现场。这些团队中的每一个都有非常强大的哲学和流程，这与 Greg 和 Howard 所做的非常相似，也是他们每天实践和相信的。在 Wellington，我们将此结合起来。我认为每家公司都有自己的优势，而我们的优势在于我们非常注重协作。在我在 Wellington 的 33 年里，我们真正打破了部门间的壁垒，因此我们的股票多头投资者会与我们的固定收益同事协作，他们又会与我们的私募资产同事协作，这些同事负责私募资产和多空策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you and um thank you for sharing all your insights that was really fascinating um when I was sitting there listening it made me think you know we have about 60 teams like you said we're or we're not organized by one overarching philosophy and process I guess our overwatching philosophy and process is that we believe a philosophy and process is critical um to the investment team we have about 60 teams um and um and and each of those teams we have we have a few in the audience today each of those teams have a very strong philosophy and process very similar to what um Greg and Howard um do and that's what they practice every day and that's what they believe um we combine that at Wellington um every I think every company has an edge I think our Edge is um that we are really collaborative so we have over the you know I've been at Wellington for 33 years over those 33 years we have really broken down silos and so that our long only investors on in equity collaborate with our fixed income um um colleagues who collaborate with our private call colleagues who do private assets and who do long short um.</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：这就是我们的“秘诀”。我们如何做到这一点？我们没有一个首席投资官（CIO），我们有 600 个首席投资官。我们已经将对任何话题持有不同观点并进行辩论常态化，然后每个团队都可以去实践他们深思熟虑、坚定不移的信念，关于如何为客户赚钱。这就是我们的组织方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's the secret sauce like how do we we don't have one CIO we have 600 cios and we have normalized debates having different perspectives on any topic and then and then each of those teams can go and practice their very well thought out strong strongly held beliefs about how they're going to make money for clients that that's how we're organized.</p>
</details>

### 私募市场与公开市场投资的异同

主持人：非常好。Patrick，我将把您拉入对话。您所做业务的私募性质对您的投资流程有任何直接影响吗？私募市场投资与公开市场投资之间是否存在任何本质上的不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very good Patrick I'll pull you into the conversation that the private nature of what you do have any direct implications on your investment process is there anything intrinsically different between private Market investing and public market investing?</p>
</details>

Patrick Healy：嗯，我想鉴于我的性格，我可能听起来像是私募股权的代言人，但我想说，私募股权是一个具有优势的资产类别，如果你想从事投资业务的话。你首先从结构开始，我们有一个 10 年，或者说一个 5 年的投资期，我们可以将资金投资 10 年，甚至可能是 12 年。所以我们不必一直投资，你可以选择你的时机，这是一个巨大的优势。你可以进行内部尽职调查，这绝对是一个巨大的优势。你可以选择和挑选你的管理团队，你可以借钱。我从事这项工作已经 30 年了，我记得在我最初的 15 年里，你实际上是带着契约（covenants）借钱的，但在过去的 15 年里，我们是在没有契约的情况下获得贷款，这真是非同寻常。你可以选择何时出售一家企业，而且你可以在董事会中实现一致性，投资者和管理团队之间是一致的。你可以选择三到四件你真正想做的事情，我认为这是一个巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, um, I suppose given my deme of nature I might sound like the poster child for private Equity but I'll say um look I think private Equity is an advantaged asset class if you're going to be in the investment business um and you sort of start with just the structure you know we have a 10 we have a a 5-year investment period we can have the money invested for 10 maybe 12 years so we don't have to be invested all the time you can pick your spots that's a huge Advantage you get to do inside diligence that's an absolutely huge Advantage you get to choose and select your management teams you get to borrow money and I've been doing this for 30 years and I can remember I really over you know my first 15 years you actually borrowed money with covenants but for the last 15 years we get lent money without covenants so that's sort of extraordinary you get to choose when you want to sell a business um and you get to have alignment you know in the boardroom it's sort of the investor and the management team you get to choose three to four things that you really want to go for I think that's a huge Advantage.</p>
</details>

Patrick Healy：所以，当我们思考我们自己的投资流程以及如何管理风险时，就像 Howard 和 Greg 谈到的那样，这真的关乎对业务细节的极度微观关注，并确保我们以这种方式保持我们的标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as we think about sort of our own investment process and sort of managing risk like Howard and Greg you know talked about you know it's really about being super micro obsessed with the specifics of the business and ensuring that we you know maintain our standards that way.</p>
</details>

### 长期投资的视角

主持人：嗯，您确实是为长期而投资，这可以很好地引出长期投资的话题。Greg、Howard，投资期限如何融入您的投资哲学和投资信条？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MH and you really invest for the longterm and that could be like a good say segue into long-term investing um Greg Howard how do you incorporate how does investment Horizon fit into your investment philosophy and your invest or like philosophic breed?</p>
</details>

Howard Marks：嗯，就像 Patrick 所说，我们大约一半的资产是封闭式基金（**Closed-end Funds**：一种有固定发行股份数量的投资基金，投资者不能直接向基金公司赎回股份，而是在二级市场交易），你可以在一段时间内持有这些资金。最大的优势是客户无法撤资。所以，你知道，那些无法控制自己情况的人喜欢在兴奋时买入，在沮丧时卖出，而这种方法可以阻止他们这样做。这是投资业务中最大的优势之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well like uh Patrick says um maybe half of our assets are closed in funds where you have the money for a period of time and the great Advantage is that the clients can't withdraw so you know they people out of control of their situation love to buy when they're excited and sell when they're depressed and our our this approach keeps them from doing so that's one of the greatest Advantage one can have in the investment business.</p>
</details>

Howard Marks：我认为 Oaktree 的每个人都理解我们的文化。我们实际上甚至没有一条哲学原则谈论长期投资，这只是心照不宣的。你知道，当我旅行，特别是去欧洲时，人们发现我从事投资业务，他们会说：“哦，你交易什么？”我感到不适。我说我们不交易。交易是猜测明天会发生什么。我们是投资者，我们着眼于长期。我认为，这个舞台上的每个人都更像投资者而不是交易者。我不知道一个人如何在短期内通过运行如此系统化的策略来获得优势。Greg，你同意吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I think that everybody at Oak Tree understands our culture we don't we actually don't even have a tenant of our philosophy to talks about long-term investing it's just understood you know when I when I travel especially to Europe and people find out I'm in the investment business they say oh what do you trade my back goes up I said we don't trade trading is guessing what something's going to do tomorrow we're investors we're in it for the long term and I think that um I think everybody on this stage is more of an investor than a Trader uh it I I don't I don't understand how one gets an advantage in the short term running such a systematic strategy correct do you agree?</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：嗯，我认为当我听 Howard 和舞台上每个人所说的话时，最重要的一点是，从长远来看，你必须知道你的优势是什么。这是关键，对吧？所以对我们来说，我们真正理解并关注的时间框架是 6 到 18 个月。对一些人来说，这很长；对另一些人来说，这很短。但 6 到 18 个月是我们深思熟虑的结果，我们相信，尽管 Howard 对宏观投资有自己的看法，但我们在理解世界正在发生什么方面拥有优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think the mean things when I listen to Howard and and what everybody on the stage saying I think the main thing is is in the long term you have to know what your advantage is and that's the big thing right so for us our our time frame that we really understand well we focus on is 6 to 18 months so for some that's very long term for some that's very short term but but 6 to 18 months is what we've thought really hard about is and um and believe despite Howard's thoughts on macro investing that that we have an edge in understanding what's happened in the world.</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：现在，正如他所说，我们经常犯错，所以你必须知道如何为犯错做好准备。在宏观领域，有很多宏观因素在起作用，所以你可以分散投资于你正在谈论的许多不同事物。但我认为，起点是这一点，而且如果你知道自己的优势是什么，如果你坚持下去，如果你保持谦逊，并且不断学习，那么长期来看就会成功。如果你执着于任何可能出错的特定事物，并且没有办法不断改进和学习，那么长期来看就不会成功。但对于我们每个人来说，我认为主要问题是：你的优势是什么？你真的拥有它吗？你能否不断改进它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">now we are wrong a lot to his point and so you have to know how to be prepared for being wrong and within macro there's a lot of macro things going on so you can diversify across Ross many different things that you're you're talking about but um but I think the starting point is that and that there the longterm is going to work out if you know what your Edge is if you stick to it if you're humble about it and you continue to learn and long term is not going to work out if you're stuck on any particular um thing that you might be wrong about and that you don't have a way of constantly improving and constantly learning um but for each of us I think the main question is what is the edge do you actually have it and can you continue to improve it?</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：嗯，您在担任投资组合经理时以长期投资者著称，现在依然如此。您如何鼓励 Wellington 的投资组合经理进行长期思考？部分原因在于我们的结构，因为我们是一个私人合伙企业，我们可以激励投资者，我们可以评估他们，我们可以在很长一段时间内培养他们。所以这种结构使得我们能够做到这一点，我们真正地在很长一段时间内支付我们的投资者，并且与我们的客户高度一致。我认为这是非常关键的优势之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mhm you are known as a very long-term investor in your portfolio manager days which still um one how do you encourage your portfolio managers at Wellington to think long term so part of it is our structure because we are a private partnership we are we we can incent investors we can evaluate them we develop them over long periods of time so that that structure enables that that we are we are really paying our investors over very aligned with our clients I think that's that's one of the very key advantages um.</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：然后，因为我们有 60 位投资者，我算是其中投资期限最长的之一，我可能与 Howard 非常相似。我没有 12 年的投资期限，但我的换手率非常低，我的换手率是 10% 到 12%。这与我所投资的行业非常吻合，这是一个非常长周期、低换手率的行业，即医疗保健。但也有其他投资者有更高的换手率。所以我们尝试做的一件事是，我们做了很多交易分析：你是否通过交易赚钱？如果你没有，如果你有一个较短的投资期限，那么回到 Greg 所说的，你的洞察力甜点在哪里？以及你是否能够做到？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then because we have 60 investors like I'm one of the longest term I'm probably very similar to Howard I don't quite have a 12year horizon but I have a really low turnover my turnover is 10 to 12% it very much aligns with the industry that I invest in which is a very long cycle low turnover low turnover industry and Healthcare um but but there are others that have higher turnover and so one of the things that we try to do is we we do a lot of trading analytics are you making money off your trading if you're not if you have a shorter term time Horizon um back to what Greg said what's your sweet spot of of them H having insights and and being able to so there.</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：所以，有一些人非常出色，他们的换手率很高。然后，我坚信，对我作为一名投资者来说，拥有一个低换手率的策略，并真正利用我长期以来的洞察力，是使我多年来表现出色的原因。但真正拥有这种自我意识，知道你如何产生洞察力，如何为你的客户赚钱，无论你拥有什么资产类别，我认为这都是关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are some people who are fantastic who have high turnover and then and then I strongly believe for me as a as an investor having a a low turnover strategy is and really taking advantage of the insights I have over the long term is what has enabled me to do well over many years but really having that self-awareness of how you generate insights how you're going to make money for your clients with whatever asset class you have I think is key to that.</p>
</details>

### 市场效率与Alpha生成

主持人：优秀。Howard，您谈到了市场效率及其重要性。现在市场上有无尽的信息和大量的噪音，但市场可以说随着时间的推移变得更加高效。所以，向你们两位提问：与 10、20 年前相比，您现在如何比较您的投资策略产生 **Alpha**（Alpha: 超额收益，衡量投资组合相对于基准指数的表现）的机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">excellent Howard you touched on on market efficiency and the importance of that there's now endless information and a lot of noise in the market um but markets arguably become more efficient over time so a question to both of you how do you compare the alpha generation opportunity of your investment strategies now compared to say 10 20 years ago?</p>
</details>

Howard Marks：我认为随着时间的推移，这变得越来越困难。Pedro，你知道 **Warren Buffett**（沃伦·巴菲特：美国著名投资家、慈善家）谈到 60 年前以 50 美分买入 1 美元的东西。50、40 年前你可以做到这一点。我自己也买过一些东西，当时我说这不可能存在，但你确实得到了几乎不可能错过的便宜货。今天这非常困难。如果你仔细想想，今天每个人都知道一切。今天没有不知道某件事的情况，如果它是事实的话。今天，投资组合经理很容易筛选出符合某些标准的证券。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's gotten a lot harder over time Pedro you know Warren Buffett talks about having bought dollars for 50 cents 60 uh years ago you could do that uh 50 40 years ago I myself bought things that I said this this can't be exist and yet you you got Bargains virtually that couldn't miss it's very hard today uh if you think about it everybody knows everything today there's no such thing today as not knowing something something if it's if it's fact uh today it's rather easy for portfolio managers to screen for Securities that satisfy certain criteria.</p>
</details>

Howard Marks：你知道，你以前可以以低于公司现金储备的价格购买公司，我们称之为 **Net Net Investing**（净净投资：一种价值投资策略，寻找那些市值低于其净流动资产的公司）。你现在不能再这样做了。所以随着时间的推移，知识是累积的，市场变得更加高效，击败市场变得更加困难。但我仍然相信有些人可以表现出色，他们的优势可能缩小，他们的工作时间可能更长，但我仍然认为这是可能的，只是每天都变得更难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know you used to be able to buy companies for less than their the cash in the till uh we called that net net investing you can't do that anymore and so over time uh knowledge is cumulative markets become more efficient uh it has become harder uh to beat markets still I believe believe some people can be superior their margin of superiority May shrink their their work day may get longer uh but I I still it's possible but it becomes harder every day.</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：是的，我认为这再次取决于性质。就像你描述的，50 年前人们可以，但大多数人不能，对吧？就像在某个时候，拥有计算器是一种优势，而现在拥有计算器显然不再是一种优势。但我看待它的方式有点不同。我认为这就像 **NASCAR**（美国全国运动汽车竞赛协会）或任何赛车比赛，汽车每年都在变得更好，所以你每年也必须变得更好，但仍然会有一个赢家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I think again it depends on the nature like even when you describe it 50 years ago people could but not most people didn't right like even like at some point having a calculator was an advantage and obviously having a calculator is no longer an advantage but I I look at it a little differently I think it's like the nd500 or whatever the cars get better every year so you have to get better every year but they's still a winner.</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：嗯，所以如果你不变得更好，那么你肯定会失去任何优势，它会渗透到普遍的理解中。但如果你继续变得更好，它就像 NASCAR 一样，至少我所相信的我们产生 Alpha 的核心事物并没有太大变化。我不认为我们作为一个物种在爱、恐惧和贪婪等方面变得更好了，我们或多或少地一遍又一遍地做着同样的事情。所以我同意，在计算和套利（**Arbitrage**：利用不同市场或资产之间的价格差异进行无风险交易以获利）方面，这确实更容易做到，也普遍为人所知，这些东西不再存在了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and so if you stay if you don't get better then you for sure any advantage will will seep into General understanding but if you continue to get better it is like the n500 and the core at least the core things that I believe our Alpha is generated from really aren't changing much I don't think we're getting any better as a species on things like love and fear and and greed like we keep doing the same things more or less over and over again so I agree on things like calculating and Arbitrage that is like much easier to do it's generally well known those things are not there anymore.</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：但人们会犯下非常愚蠢的错误，如果你有办法理解并做到这一点，那么这种情况会继续存在。当我审视市场以及价格相对于基本面状况的波动性时，它看起来并不像我们变得更聪明了。套利确实正在消失，我认为这是事实。可以计算的东西正在消失。那些非常难以计算的东西似乎一如既往地波动。人类的误判仍在继续。所以，我不知道，我再次同意，如果是一个既定的套利机会，它不会长期存在，它会被学会。但其他事情，在我看来，或多或少地像人类历史上一直存在的那样继续着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the fact that people are going to make we all will make really dumb mistakes and if you have ways of understanding that and doing that that that continues and I really when I look at the markets and the volatility of the prices relative to the fundamental conditions or whatever it doesn't look like we're getting that much smarter um it's true on arbitrages are going away I think that is the case things that you can calculate are going away things that are very hard to calculate seem as volatile as ever um and the miscalculations of human beings continue um so I I don't know that again I would agree if it's an established Arbitrage it will not exist for like it'll get learned but other things um continue more or less as they have through all human history it appears to me.</p>
</details>

主持人：私募市场中是否仍有更多低效率可供探索，以及这种情况会持续多久？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are there still more inefficiencies in a in private markets to be explored relative to public and for how long?</p>
</details>

Patrick Healy：我认为私募市场，我的意思是，我们现在已经进入私募市场机构化 40 年了。而且，你知道，私募股权无疑是一个投资类别，在我的世界里，我们互相购买彼此的投资组合，因为，你知道，你为什么要抢银行？因为钱在那里。所以很多资产都掌握在私人手中。我看着 Christian，我们从你那里买了一家企业。Nick Humph 也在这里，我们从 HG 那里买了一些。真正有趣的是，即使是从像赞助商这样的专业所有者那里购买私募市场中的东西，其回报率与首次收购的回报率是相同的。所以你坐在那里，你会问自己为什么。我认为这有很多因素，包括拥有与众不同的观点，Howard 也谈到了这一点。拥有受过专业训练的管理团队，他们真正知道自己在业务方面做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the PRI I mean private markets were what 40 years now into ins institutionalization of private markets and you know for sure private Equity um I think that there uh you know is a whole class of uh investing that goes on of my world where we buy from each other's portfolios cuz like uh you know why do you rob a bank because that's where the money is so many assets are owned in private hands so I look at Christian we bought a business from you Nick humph is here from HG we bought misses from them and what's really interesting is the return profile of buying things in the private markets even from professional owners like sponsors is really the same as it would be for a primary buyout and so you sort of sit there you say you ask yourself why and I think it's a whole bunch of factors including you know having a differentiated point of view which Howard spoke about it's having professionally trained management teams that really you know know what they're doing in terms of businesses.</p>
</details>

Patrick Healy：所以我实际上认为，现在公开市场存在很多低效率。我认为有很多非常好的企业，但股票表现却很糟糕。你知道，25% 的公开市场股票比其高点低 50% 或更多。所以，你知道，就我的购物清单而言，我现在花更多时间在公开市场上，因为我认为你在公开市场中获得的波动性比在私募市场中要大得多，因为当你私有化并且不必出售时，你就不会出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I actually think right now uh there's a lot of inefficiencies in in the public markets I think there's a ton of really good businesses but crummy stocks you know 25% of the public markets are 50% or below their highs so you know in terms of my shopping list um I'm spending a little bit more time at the public markets right now because I think you get much more volatility in the Public Public markets than you do in the private markets because when you're private and if you don't have to sell you don't sell.</p>

### 从错误中学习：机构化方法

主持人：换个话题。Greg 谈到了复利学习的力量。事情可能不会总是像我们想象的那样发展。您如何在您的组织中将从错误中学习制度化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">changing tack a bit Greg talked about the power of compounding learning um things may not always pan out the way that we thought that we think that they will um how do you instit institutionalize learning from mistakes in your organization?</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：嗯，我们做了很多事情。有些是短期的，我们每天都有一个日常会议。在那个日常会议上，它发生在我们的伦敦办公室，在亚洲和伦敦之间，以及波士顿和我们在伦敦的美国办公室之间。每天我们都会谈论各种事情，有时包括市场中发生的事情。你知道，你从上次市场出现这种情况中学到了什么？你从中学到了什么错误？所以我们这样做，这是一种持续的、持续的。回到拥有不同视角，会有人来到我们的日常会议说：“我错了，这是我学到的。”所以我们已经将——不当明星，不总是正确——常态化了。正如我们所知，作为一名投资者，你经常会犯错。所以这些是我们做的一些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um we do we do a number of things some shortterm we have a daily meeting every day and in that daily meeting which happens in our London office between Asia and London and and in between Boston and our us offices in in London every day we talk about um all kinds of things and including sometimes we talk about if something's happening in the market you know what did you learn from the last time the market was like that what what mistakes did you learn so we do that that's sort of a constant a constant and back to like having different perspectives there will be people that will come to our daily meeting and said I got this wrong and this is what I learned so we have normalized um sort of not being a star and not being right all the time which is as we know being an investor you're wrong quite often um so that so those are some of the things we do.</p>
</details>

Jean Hynes：然后我们还做这些叫做“经验教训”（Lessons Learned）的事情。我们会请一位投资了 25 年或 30 年的人，然后我们请他们变得脆弱，比如：“你投资生涯中真正的原因和开创性时刻是什么？”这真的关乎这些演讲者作为一个人是谁，他们相信什么，以及他们如何投资。他们的职业生涯中有哪些四五个指路牌？所有这些都被记录下来，人们观看它们并从中学习。它让你很好地认识到人们是人类。我们努力，你知道，我们没有明星文化。人们越愿意教导他人，并教导自己，你知道，正如我们所知，你并没有学到所有东西。我五十多岁了，我投资了 33 年，我仍在学习。所以你如何确保这成为日常语言的一部分？所以这些是我们随着时间不断做的一些事情，它们使你不断犯错的事实常态化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then we also do these things called Lessons Learned so we would have someone who's been investing for 25 years or 30 years and um and we asked them to be vulnerable like what like what was what really was the reason and the seminal moments in your investing career and it's really about investing these these talks who they are as a person what do they believe and how are they're investing what are the four or five guide posts that sort of made their career and those are all recorded and people watch them and and learn from them um and it gives you a good appreciation of of just that people people are human beings um we try to you know we don't have a star culture and the more people are willing to teach others um and teach themselves that and you know as we know you you you haven't learned everything like I'm in my mid-50s I've been investing for 33 years I'm still learning um and so how do you how do you make sure that that's part of the everyday language so those are some of the sort of the the things we do constantly over time that sort of normalizes the fact that you're making mistakes all the time.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的。Howard，您对错误制度化有什么看法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">good Howard any views on the institutionalization of M mistakes?</p>
</details>

Howard Marks：嗯，你知道，我们没有这样的流程。你的问题让我觉得也许我们应该有，也许这就是为什么我好奇，也许我们会。但是，我们有团队，正如 Jean 所说，并且高度独立。我们的决策过程是去中心化的，只要在我们这里，每个人都遵循相同的哲学和目标体系。但是，我们没有进行事后分析的流程，我认为这是一个很好的学习方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know we we don't have a process for that uh your question suggests to me maybe that we should uh and maybe and maybe that's why I'm curious and maybe we will uh but uh our uh we have groups as as Jean says uh and and a high degree of uh Independence uh we're decentralized in our decision making process as long as in our case everybody follows the same philosophy and goal system uh but uh but we don't have a process for uh post-mortems and I think it's a it's a good way to learn.</p>
</details>

Greg Jensen：嗯，这对我们的哲学至关重要，而且要明确的是，这非常困难，因为她谈论的事情非常重要，那就是你最不想做的事情就是惩罚错误。你必须帮助人们学习。所以我们一直在努力寻找正确的制度化方式。但我已经制度化了很长时间，所以快速分享一下我的想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MH it's so so critical to our philosophy and we to be clear it's very hard because the thing that she's talking about was so important which is you you the last thing you want to do is punish mistakes you have to help people learn and and so we struggled with the right institutionalization but I've been institutionalizing this for a long time so just to share quickly thoughts on it.</p>

Greg Jensen：我的意思是，我想说的第一件事是，如果我在任何没有真正的“问题日志”（**Issue Log**：记录和跟踪问题、错误或待解决事项的系统）的组织中，它都非常有价值，而且它确实有效。对我们来说，人们很容易输入问题。再次，当你思考哪些问题是重要的时，每个人都有问题，但对我们来说重要的问题是那些阻碍你实现目标的问题。所以对我来说，拥有一个诊断过程，我们让人们很容易输入，也很容易诊断正在发生的事情。这有两个层面。一个层面是组织内部的问题，但你也有这个记录，你实际上诊断并决定是否因此改变任何事情，对吧？谈论问题很容易，但你真的在改变任何事情吗？通常正确的答案是“我没有改变任何事情”。

<p class="english-text">I mean the first thing I would say if I were in anybody's organization that doesn't like having a real issue log is so valuable and it actually works like for us it's very easy for people to enter issues and again when you think through what are the issues that matter everybody's got issues but the issues that matter to us are the things that are preventing you from achieving your goals and so to me then having a diagnosis process that we let people make it easy for people to enter and make it easy for people like to diagnose what's happening there's two levels of that there's the level of like in the org problems but then you have this record you actually diagnose and decide are you going to change anything as a result of this right it's easy to talk about problems but are you actually changing anything and often times the right answer is I'm not changing anything.</p>

Greg Jensen：错误是正常的一部分，但主动决定我们是否要改变什么，或者我们是否不改变什么，这非常重要。所以，有一个简单的方法让人们做到这一点，并看到它确实在发生，这非常重要。鼓励它，最重要的是，最高级的领导者，首席执行官（CEO）、首席投资官（CIO），他们是那些被记录问题的人，他们是那些直面问题的人，因为他们做出了最大、最重要的决定。所以，确保问责制（accountability）的箭头是向上的，而不是向下的，这是我们组织中一个非常关键的教训。我认为我们有很多箭头是向下的，这是一个巨大的错误。鼓励问责制的箭头向上，对我们组织来说是一个巨大的教训，它真的改变了一切。

<p class="english-text">um like that mistakes are a normal part of it but knowing whether actively deciding are we going to change something or are we not going to change something super important so having a simple way for people to do that and see that it's actually happening is super important encouraging it mostly most important is that the most senior leaders the CEO the CIO they're the ones getting issue logged and they're the ones staring because they make the biggest most important decisions so making sure the arrow of accountability goes up not down um super critical lesson in R I think we had a lot of the arrow going down and it was a big mistake encouraging the arrow of accountability to go up uh was a huge lesson in our organization i' change everything honestly believe.</p>

Greg Jensen：在投资流程方面，系统化投资的一大优点是，我们通过归因（attribution）知道每一个错误，小到每一个数据，每一个逻辑片段，每一个数据，我们都知道我们为什么会犯错。就像他所说的糟糕的宏观投资一样，对吧？我真的以为我们两年前左右会进入衰退，天哪，我错了，对吧？但是，好吧，我们学到了一些我们以前不知道的世界知识。通过能够将它归因于每一行推理，我们所学到的导致我们得出那个相当强烈的结论的一切（不是强到灾难性的程度，就像他所说的），知道我们很容易犯错，但能够将它归因于其他一切，然后归因于阻止那次衰退的资金来自哪里，归因于所有这些事情，你从中学习到了什么，这对于正确地做到这一点至关重要。

<p class="english-text">and the um and then on the investment process I one of the great things back to systematic investing is you we know on attribution every mistake down to every data every little piece of logic every data we know exactly why we got everything wrong like speaking to his to his point about terrible macro investing right like I really thought we were going into a recession two and two years ago or so and man was I wrong right and and but okay we learned something about the world that we didn't know and um and by being able to attribute that to every line of reasoning everything that we had ever learned that led us to that pretty strong conclusion not so strong that was disastrous in the way he's saying but pretty strong strong conclusion knowing that we could easily be wrong but that that but being able to attribute that to everything else and then attribute well where did the money come from that prevented that recession attribute every one of those things and what do you learn from that super super critical thing to get to get right.</p>

Greg Jensen：我只想说，我认为每个人都可以做的事情，我强烈推荐的是，只需有一个问题日志，诊断重要问题，养成习惯，并将其常态化。这会让组织变得更好。

<p class="english-text">and I would just say the thing I think everybody can do and I would highly recommend just have an issue log diagnose important issues get in the habit of it and normaliz it don't make the organization so much better.</p>

### 专业化与大局观的权衡

主持人：优秀。在我们结束之前，最后一个话题：专业化。那么，在投资中，过度专业化和错过大局之间的权衡是什么？

<p class="english-text">excellent one last topic before we wrap up specialization um so when investing what are the tradeoffs uh between specializing too much and missing the big picture?</p>

Howard Marks：嗯，50 年前，我办公桌上方有一张发黄的剪报，它来自 **FT**（《金融时报》：英国一家知名的国际性商业报纸），上面写着：分析师是那些对少数事物了解很多，并对越来越少的事物了解越来越多，直到对一无所知的人。投资组合经理是那些对很多事物了解一点点，并对越来越多事物了解越来越少，直到对一切一无所知的人。我们必须弥合这个鸿沟。我们必须知道，在我们的组织中，有些人拥有信息，而其他人需要这些信息，我们必须将这些信息传递给他们。而需要这些信息的人必须知道它的存在以及在哪里。这是我们任何组织中最大的挑战之一。

<p class="english-text">Well I used to have a yellowed clipping above my desk 50 years ago orange so it came from the ft and it said that an analyst is somebody who knows a lot about a few things and learns more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing a portfolio manager is somebody who knows a little bit about a lot of things and learns less and less about more and more until he knows nothing about everything we have to bridge that Gap we have to know that there's information in our organization that some people have and other people need and we have to get it to them and the people who need it have to know that it exists and where this is one of the greatest uh challenges in our in any organiz ganization.</p>

Howard Marks：Greg 描述了他们所有的学习和发现是如何被计算机化并共享的，我认为这是一个好主意。但是，你知道，投资组合经理必须将大量资产组合在一起，而他对这些资产了解甚少，他如何才能充分利用分析师们对少数事物了解如此之多的知识呢？你知道，我们一直在为此挣扎，没有简单的答案。

<p class="english-text">Greg described uh the way all of their learnings and findings are actually uh computerize and computerized and shared and I think it's a good idea but um you know how will the portfolio manager who has to put together a large number of assets about which he knows less ever get full advantage of of the knowledge that the analysts who know so much about a few things have and it's you know we struggle with it all the time there's no easy answer.</p>
