### Exor 的核心理念与多元化投资组合

**Nikolai**: 大家好，我今天非常幸运，因为我们邀请到了 **John Elkann**（Exor 首席执行官：一家拥有法拉利、Stellantis 等品牌的荷兰控股公司，根植于意大利）来访。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi everyone I'm really lucky today because we've got John alen visiting.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: John 是 **Exor**（一家荷兰控股公司，但根植于意大利）的首席执行官。他们拥有像法拉利（Ferrari）这样的品牌，并通过 **Stellantis**（一家跨国汽车制造商，旗下拥有菲亚特、标致、克莱斯勒、Jeep 等众多品牌）拥有菲亚特（Fiat）、标致（Peugeot）、Jeep 和玛莎拉蒂（Maserati）等品牌。他们还是《经济学人》集团（The Economist Group）的最大所有者，甚至拥有一家名为尤文图斯（Juventus）的足球俱乐部。所以，总的来说，这是一个相当惊人的组合。在我们的基金中，我们持有的股份价值 34 亿挪威克朗。John，非常热烈的欢迎。

<p class="english-text">John is the CEO of exor which is a Dutch holding company with Italian Roots they own things like Ferrari and through stantis they also have Brands like Fiat P Jeep and Maserati they also the largest owner of the economist group and they even have a football club called Juventus so pretty amazing all together in a fun we own shares worth 34 billion Groner a very warm welcome jump.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 谢谢你邀请我，Nikolai，也谢谢你对我们公司和我们旗下公司的信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thank you for having me Nikolai and thank you for your trust uh with us and our companies.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您如何看待 Exor 这家公司？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how do you look at exor as a company?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: Exor 是一家与优秀人才一起构建伟大公司的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exor is a company that builds great companies with great people.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您是如何做到这一点的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">and how do you do that?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我们通过选择公司，作为这些公司的所有者全身心投入，并将我们的所有权与这些公司的治理和领导层保持一致来努力实现这一目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we try and do that by choosing the companies by committing ourselves as owners of these companies and aligning our ownership with the governance of these companies and the leadership of these companies.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 全球还有其他一些集团也在尝试做同样的事情，比如沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）的 **伯克希尔哈撒韦**（Berkshire Hathaway: 一家美国跨国企业集团控股公司），以及瑞典的 **瓦伦堡** 家族（Wallenberg: 瑞典一个著名的金融和工业家族，通过其投资公司 Investor AB 控制着众多瑞典大型企业）。您的经营理念与他们有何异同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you have some other groups worldwide who is trying to do the same you of course have Warren Buffett's uh B Hathaway you have the wenberg in Sweden just how would your philosophy be similar or different?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 这些都是非常好的例子，我们非常尊重和钦佩这些例子。两者都曾是我们的榜样，因为它们都是许多公司的所有者，长期投入思考者，并且真正相信人才和领导力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well those are very good examples um and very respected uh examples by us and and admired and both have have served as Role Models as both of them are owners of many companies engaged long-term thinkers and True Believers in in people and and Leadership.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您如何决定购买什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you decide what to buy?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我们最终会真正反思我们感兴趣的行业，最近医疗保健已成为我们 Exor 的重点关注领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we end up really trying to reflect on sectors we're interested and most recently healthc care has really become the area of of focus that we've have at exor um.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我们会回到这些公司中的许多家，但您知道，我们是一个真正着眼长远的集团。您拥有这家足球俱乐部已经差不多 100 年了，很少有公司能真正长寿。我想您曾提到，一百万家公司中只有 45 家能存活一个多世纪。那么，为什么你们能持续经营呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we'll come back to to um to many of these companies but you know you are um a really long-term um thinking group you own the football club for 100 years pretty much and uh few companies get really old I think um you have mentioned that only 45 out of a million companies survive for more than a century so why why why are you guys dealing business well.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 您真正需要思考的是，要持续发展，您就需要不断更新自己，确保您所做的事情保持与时俱进，并且您的组织和公司能力能够确保您今天、昨天和明天都保持与时俱进。这其中蕴含着真正的信念和毅力，以确保您所从事和为之努力的事业是持久的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what you need really to to think about is to last you need to renew yourself and make sure that what you do remains current and your your abilities as an organization as a company are ones that allow you to make sure that you are as current today as you were yesterday as you will be tomorrow and there's that real belief and fortitude that comes with it in in trying to make sure that what you are working on and what you're working for is enduring.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您如何确保自己保持与时俱进？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you make sure you stay current?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 在竞争激烈的市场中，您的客户和竞争对手总是会提醒您正在发生什么。了解客户的需求以及竞争对手的行为方式，是让您保持最警觉的关键。另一方面，能够探索、创新和发明也是一件美妙的事情，这是自我更新的重要组成部分。

<details>

<p class="english-text">you you are always reminded in a competitive market Marketplace about what is happening by your customers by your competitors and being aware of what your customers want and and how your competitors are actually behaving is is what keeps you most alert on the other hand what is wonderful is also to be able to explore innovate and vent and and that is a big part of renewing ones themselves.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 因为尤其在我们所处的行业中，我们的一些公司已经存在了三个多世纪，最近的一家是 **飞利浦**（Philips: 一家荷兰跨国科技公司，专注于健康科技），在这段时间里，它也基于新的事物、新的想法和最终成为现实的发明。

<details>

<p class="english-text">MH because you you you are particularly in in the industries in which we operate and some of our companies have over free centuries of existence and the most recently one is Phillips over that amount of time it is also based on new things new ideas and and inventions that become reality MH.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 家族所有权和家族支持或承诺有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how important is the family ownership and family backing or commitment?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为，对一个组织来说，承诺所有权非常重要，它提供了稳定性。我相信，家族控制的公司与公开市场相结合，是家族提供的稳定性和长期思维，以及作为上市公司通过投资者获得的刺激之间的一个非常好的组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that a committed ownership is very important for an organization uh it provides that stability uh I believe that family controlled companies and and within uh the public markets are a very good combination between the stability that a family provides and the long-term thinking but being a public company the stimulus that you have by having investors um.</p>
</details>

### 家族传承与领导力发展

**Nikolai**: John，您的背景非常令人难以置信。您在 21、22 岁时就被任命负责这个集团。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">John your background is is uh pretty incredible you were put in charge of this group when you were 21 22.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我在 1997 年 21 岁时成为董事，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I became a director at 21 in 1997 yeah.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您能告诉我们这一切是如何发生的吗？因为您的祖父是传奇人物 **Gianni Agnelli**（意大利工业家，曾长期担任菲亚特集团董事长），是他选中了您。这一切是如何发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you just want to tell us about uh how this all came about because your grandfather was uh you know the legendary onelli and he kind of picked you just how how did this come about?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我一直对学习和了解商业有着浓厚的兴趣。我 18 岁时在都灵学习工程学。我曾在多个国家生活，在开始学习的同时，我也开始工作，并花更多时间与我的祖父和他的同事们在一起，越来越多地参与公司事务。1997 年，随着我们即将迎来 1999 年的百年庆典，他觉得董事会中应该有年轻一代的代表，于是他任命我为家族继续对公司承诺的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always had uh very keen interest in um in in learning and learning about uh business and I studied engineering uh in Trin when I was 18 years old I I lived in multiple countries and as I started uh studying I also started working and spending more time with with my grandfather and and and his colleagues and being more and more involved with the company and he felt uh in 1997 um as we were approaching the Centennial in 1999 that it was important to have on the board uh a representation of the younger generation and he he appointed me as as the choice of continuing the commitment our family had with the company.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 那时我 21 岁，顺便说一句，这与他加入菲亚特董事会时的年龄相同。当时是他的祖父，我的曾曾祖父，菲亚特的创始人 **Giovanni Agnelli**（意大利工业家，菲亚特汽车公司的创始人），指定了他。我认为这部分是象征性的，旨在表达对一家即将迎来百年庆典并为下一个世纪做准备的公司的承诺，但也是他想给我的一次绝佳机会，因为他观察到我对学习有着浓厚的兴趣。他的建议至今仍然适用：没有人会对你抱有期望，重要的是你要学会倾听和提问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at 21 years old which by the way was the same age he joined the board of Fiat uh which was uh his grandfather my great great-grandfather the founder of Fiat that uh indicated him and and I think that it was partially symbolic to show commitment to a company that was turning a 100 years and in preparation for its Next Century but but also a great opportunity that he wanted to give me as he was observing that I had a keen interest in in learning and his advice which remains true to to this day was no one's going to expect nothing from you the important thing is for you to learn to listen and to ask questions.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您认为他看到了您身上的哪些特质？他欣赏您哪些方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what did he see in you what do you think were the traits that he admired in you?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为我的祖父是一个相信自由的人，他认为你不能强迫人们做出选择，但你需要让他们能够努力实现自己的抱负。他普遍认为，在当时的工作环境中，我有着真正的兴趣和好奇心。所以，那正是他当时所看到的，以及我的投入。我当时在学习，也在工作，我这样做是因为我真正喜欢它，而不是被迫的。这两者的结合，在那时，无疑是关键因素，因为 21 岁时，你不能说自己取得了多大的成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that um my my grandfather uh was was someone who believed in uh in Freedom and that you can't force people in choices but you need to enable them in making sure that they can uh work to what their aspirations are and he generally felt as as also the envir his working environment uh that I I had real interest and real curiosity so that that is really at that point what he seen he was seeing and commitment I was studying and I was also working um and I was doing that because I truly enjoyed it not because it was forced on me and the combination of those two were were were were the definitely at that point um because at 21 years old you you cannot say you've achieved much.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您现在是意大利最大的雇主，您的集团有 40 万名员工。在 21 岁时被赋予这种责任，或者知道自己将来会承担这种责任，感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you're now the biggest employer in Italy right you have 400,000 people working in your group how does that feel like a 21y old to be given that type of responsibility or or to know that you will get the responsibility at some stage?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 责任是你所拥有的。我个人从小就一直感到有责任感。我们在许多不同的国家长大，父母离异，我与兄弟姐妹非常亲近，并且总是努力在学校、体育环境中承担责任。承担责任无疑是我一直以来所向往的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">responsibility is is something that you have yeah and uh I I've personally always felt responsible felt responsible um since a very very early age um as we we were growing up in many different countries and we had divorced parents and was very much very close to to my siblings and always tried to be responsible uh in in school settings Sports settings uh and taking on taking on responsibility was definitely something that uh I I always uh was drawn to.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: Exor 的价值观之一是勇气和责任。困难是您展现勇气和对他人负责的时刻。在我担任菲亚特董事的 20 多年，接近 30 年的时间里，有过许多时刻需要承担责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one of the values we have at exor is courage and responsibility and difficulties are the moments in which you can show courage and you can show responsibility for for others and over the course of the more than 20 20 CL getting close to 30 years uh that I'm I've been involved as as a director of fied back in 1997 there have been many moments of time uh where that responsibility uh was was acted on.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 他们如何培养您承担这份责任？他们让您接触了哪些事物？他们把您介绍给了哪些人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do they prepare you for taking on that responsibility what do they what kind of things do they expose you to who do they introduce you to?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我的祖父会带着我和我的兄弟姐妹，我们接触他的生活以及他会见的人。他喜欢做的是，他会接听那些与工作相关的专业电话，我们会在他说话时和他待在一起。然后他会接电话，我们听不到对方在说什么，所以我们必须猜测，然后我们会在之后就对方说了什么进行讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my grandfather he would take me and also my my brother and my sister we we would be exposed to his life and to people he would be to he would be meeting uh what he liked to do is he'd have these phone calls which were professional work rated phone calls and we'd spend time with him as we were speaking then he'd take a phone call and he have that phone call but we couldn't really listen to what the other person was saying so we had to guess and then somehow we had these conversations after about what actually the other person was saying.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 他和什么样的人说话？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what type of people did he speak to?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 可能是他的同事，可能是商业伙伴，也可能是与他共事的各种不同的人。这无疑是一种非常有启发性的方式。我的家人，我的祖父，并没有强加任何形式的学徒制。那更多的是我最终想要的东西，这也是为什么我在学习期间就开始了学徒生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it would be colleagues of his would be business partner would be uh would be different different persons with whom he he was uh working um and and that definitely was a a very formative way my family uh my grandfather were not imposing any form of apprentice apprenticeship uh that was more something I ended up uh wanting which is why I I started uh while I was studying apprenticeships.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您提到了像 **Sergio Marchionne**（意大利裔加拿大商人，曾任菲亚特克莱斯勒汽车公司首席执行官）这样的人物，他是意大利一位杰出的首席执行官。那么，在您成为领导者和思想家的过程中，真正起到关键作用的人有哪些？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you mentioned yourself people like Sergio maon which is who's you know the phenomenal CEO in Italy so who have been the really instrumental people in forming you as a leader and thinker?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我非常幸运，有许多与我共事过的人拥有智慧和经验。我的祖父的同事 **John Luigi Gabetti**（意大利商人，曾与 Gianni Agnelli 密切合作）与他共事了几十年，Sergio 与我共事了 14 年，还有我的许多同事都非常出色。尤其是我相对年轻就开始工作，我很幸运能在年轻时与经验丰富的人共事。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I was incredibly fortunate to have uh many people uh whom I worked with had wisdom and experiences um my grandfather's colleagues um John Luigi gabetti with whom he worked for many decades Serio with whom I worked for 14 years and and many many of my colleagues have been uh incredible particularly as as I started relatively young uh I was very fortunate to be able to work at a young age with people who had a lot of experience.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我还要说，我一直努力向他人学习，花时间研究其他家族控制的公司是如何运作的。您提到的伯克希尔哈撒韦或瓦伦堡家族的例子一直是我的榜样。我很幸运能与巴菲特先生在奥马哈共度时光，或者与瓦伦堡家族在斯德哥尔摩交流。通过提问并真正有兴趣了解这些经验如何适用于我们，以及在创业和投资领域，我的生活让我能够与许多对我们发展非常有帮助的人互动。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I will also say that I've always been uh trying to to learn uh from from others and spend time uh studying what other family controlled companies did and know the examples you men you mentioned of Burkshire hatway or investor have been role models and I was very fortunate to spend time with uh Mr Buffett in Omaha or with the wenberg family in Stockholm and and by asking and and also really genuinely uh being interested in in trying to see what that could apply to us and and equally also within the entrepreneurial world or the investment world uh my my life has allowed me to be able to interact with with many people who have who have been very helpful in in helping us become what what are.</p>
</details>

### 危机中的转型与增长

**Nikolai**: 同时，您也曾告诉我，您希望重新开始，对吧？您希望有一个全新的开始，您是新一代的开端。您是如何看待这种“重新开始”的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at the same time you mentioned to me that you kind of want to reset as well right you want to have a clean slate you are you know the new start of a new uh generation how do you how do you think about that reset?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 在我们这里，这种“重新开始”是被迫的，Nikolai。那是因为当我更多地参与进来时，也就是 2003 年到 2004 年，我的祖父在 2003 年去世，我的叔祖父在 2004 年去世。那时，我实际上代表我的家族参与我们的业务。那些是困难重重的时期，当您经历那种情况时，您会被迫做出决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">reset in our case the reset was imposed Nikolai it was imposed because when when I came uh and got more involved which was in 2003 2004 uh my grandfather passed away in 2003 my great uncle passed away in 2004 at that point uh I was in effect representing my family in in our business uh and those were times of big trouble and when you are going through those circumstances you forced into decisions.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 当您接手时，情况有多危急？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how dire was the situation when you took over?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 极其危急。我的意思是，如果您看看当时公司面临的财务和运营困难，我们无法成功的可能性极高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">incredibly dire I mean if you look between the financial and operational difficulties that the company was facing back then the likelihood of us not making it were extremely high.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 那么您做了什么？您谈到了您在接手 Exor 后经历的不同阶段。那么，当您面对那种糟糕的局面时，您做的第一件事是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what did you do we were because you you you you talk about the different faces that you've been through in EXO after you took over so what what's the first thing you do you come into that situation it doesn't look great uh what do you do?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我们作为一个家族，最终投资了公司，所以我们投入了资本，这加强了资产负债表，并与银行重新谈判，这让我们有了回旋余地。我们很幸运地任命了 Sergio，在此之前两年内我们任命了四位不同的首席运营官，但他们都没有成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we we ended up uh as a family uh investing in the company so we committed Capital which strengthened the balance sheet and renegotiated with with the banks that allowed us to have Headroom we were fortunate to appoint Sergio after having appointed four different cosos before within those two years who did not work and.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: Sergio 为公司带来了全面的展望，并实现了我们努力的扭转。2007 年，我们推出了 **菲亚特 500**（Fiat 500: 菲亚特公司生产的一款经典小型城市汽车），这是它首次推出 50 年后，那一刻我们真正感受到公司正在蓬勃发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sergio gave the company a a complete projection uh with a turnaround we worked on and the moment in which we launched the Fiat 500 in 2007 which is 50 years after it had launched being the first time was really a moment of uh where where we felt the company was was actually flourishing.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 而那正是金融危机即将爆发的时候。然后我们经历了金融危机，金融危机把我们带到了美国，在那里我们与 **克莱斯勒**（Chrysler: 美国汽车品牌）合作，克莱斯勒促成了 **菲亚特克莱斯勒**（Fiat Chrysler: 菲亚特与克莱斯勒合并后的汽车集团），也开始分离菲亚特集团旗下的不同公司，这些公司如今是全球农业设备领域的领导者 **CNH**（CNH Industrial: 专注于农业和建筑设备的全球公司），卡车和商用汽车领域的领导者之一 **Iveco**（依维柯: 意大利商用汽车制造商），以及命运截然不同的法拉利（Ferrari），它与大型汽车公司所做的事情非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that was just when the financial crisis was going to hit and and then we had the financial crisis and the financial crisis led us to America where we got involved with kryer and and kryer allowed to create Fiat kryer and also to start separating the different companies of the Fiat group who today are cnh which is a global leader in agriculture equipment IO one of the leaders in trucks and commercial vehicles and Ferrari which had a very different Destiny in terms of what it did versus a large car company.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 在此期间，我们还简化了集团，我们将不同的控股公司合并为一家，即 Exor。我们还开始重新思考我们所拥有的，努力拥有更少的公司，但更多地持有这些公司的股份。所以，如果您看看这几十年，第一个十年是生存，第二个十年是稳定，真正努力找到正确的结构，而我们现在所处的第三个十年，是我们能够实现增长的十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in the midst of that we also simplified the group and we had different holding companies which we merged into one which was exor and we also started rethinking what we owned in trying to own less companies but more of these companies so if you look at the the decades and the first decade was really survival the second decade was stability and and and really trying to find the the right construct and the third decade which is the one we're in is the decade where we have been able to grow.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 这是一个令人难以置信的发展，自从您接手以来。当我看这个集团时，您拥有真正强大的公司和强大的品牌。那么，是什么将它们联系在一起？您认为这些公司有什么共同点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well an incredible U development um since you took over now when um when I look at the group uh you have really really strong companies with strong Brands so when what what kind of ties them together what do you think they have in common these companies?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 这些公司最显著的共同点在于我们的所有权。我们非常坚信，管理公司最有效的方式是创始人主导的公司，它结合了所有权、治理和领导力。我们一直努力确保在我们所参与的所有公司中，这种明确的目标感能够得到充分体现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the defining commonality of these companies is really through our ownership uh and we believe very much that the most effective uh way in which you can manage a company is a Founder let company and and that combines the ownership the governance and the leadership and we we have tried within our companies to make sure that that Clarity of of purpose is very much felt within all the companies in which we are we are involved.</p>
</details>

### 卓越领导者的定义与薪酬理念

**Nikolai**: 您任命了许多优秀的首席执行官。您如何定义一位优秀的首席执行官？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you put great CEOs in place what do you how do you define a great CEO?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我非常幸运能与许多优秀的首席执行官合作。对我来说，一位优秀的首席执行官是真正对工作本身感兴趣，而不是对头衔感兴趣的人，是真正对纯粹意义上的竞争感兴趣的人，并且不仅喜欢公司，也喜欢与他共事的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I've been very lucky to work and and and be working with great cosos and um for me a great Co is someone who's really interested in the job and not the title MH and who's really interested in competing in the pure sense of what it means and and really likes likes not only the company but likes the people with with whom he he works uh.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 一位优秀的首席执行官也应该具备长远思考但又能立即行动的能力，既有战略眼光又能注重运营。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a a great CEO is also someone who has the ability of thinking longterm but also acting uh now being strategic but yet being operational.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您是如何找到他们的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you find them?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我们的价值观之一，对我来说很好地定义了与我们合作的领导者，是雄心和谦逊。在某些方面，我觉得文化是自我选择的，我们所处的环境是自我选择我们公司领导者的环境。

<p class="english-text">one of our values that defined for me well uh the leaders with whom we work is ambition and humility and in some ways I feel culture self- select and the the the ground in which and the environment in which we we operate is is one that self selects uh the the leaders that our companies have.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 当您与非常优秀的人合作时，机会就会出现。Sergio 曾领导我们的公司之一 **SGS**（一家全球领先的检验、验证、测试和认证公司），后来有机会接管菲亚特。最近，Garrett 曾管理 **Iveco**（依维柯），现在被任命管理 **CNH**（CNH Industrial）。我认为，为我们合作的优秀领导者创造机会，是我们取得巨大进步的一个方面。

</details>

**John Elkann**: 有些人在公司内部成长，有些人则来自外部。Nikolai，您采访过的 **Benedetto Vigna**（法拉利首席执行官），他正在管理法拉利，他来自一个不同的行业，一个不同的世界。是的，我曾担任法拉利的一年代理首席执行官，并且清楚地明白法拉利需要的不是汽车行业的人，也不是奢侈品行业的人。Benedetto 凭借他的热情和经验，为法拉利带来了公司在新世纪建设新事物所急需的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">some grow up in the companies some come from outside uh benedetto uh whom you interviewed Nikolai who's running Ferrari came from a different industry from a different world yeah uh I was acting CEO of Ferrari for a year and and clearly uh clearly understood that ferar needed not someone from the car industry not someone from the luxury industry and Benedito has given Ferrari with with his enthusiasm and and also his experience uh something that was very needed for the company to look at building something new for this Century.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 您也给员工很高的薪酬。正如您所知，我们投票反对了 **Stellantis**（跨国汽车制造商）的薪酬方案，因为我们认为该薪酬方案与我们的利益不符。您如何看待高管薪酬？对您来说，是否存在过高的薪酬方案？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you also pay um your people very well and uh uh as you know we have voted against the pay package at stantis you know the car uh group because we think uh we think the pay package is is not correctly aligned with with our interest um just how do you look at executive pay is there such a thing as too high a pay package for you?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为，如果您是一家高绩效公司，这是我们所追求的，并且如果您在竞争激烈的市场中竞争以取胜，我们相信我们需要将薪酬与我们的目标保持一致。我们的薪酬是可变薪酬，这些薪酬与结果完全挂钩。所以，如果公司赢了，公司里从首席执行官到所有不同参与者，每个人都会从中受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe that if if you are a high performing company which is what we aspire to be and if you compete within a competitive Marketplace to win uh what we believe is that we need to align our compensation with what our objectives are M and our compensations are variable compensations and these compensations are completely align with results so if we win as a company everyone who works in the company from the co to all all the different participants in the company are ones that benefit from it.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 如果您看看 2023 年，我们公司的业绩良好，整体薪酬，即可变薪酬，对每个人来说都非常有回报。所以我们认为，重要的是要明确您的薪酬目标，我们认为我们正在这样做。我们还观察到，在某些方面，您做得越好，获得的报酬就越多。因此，关于金额有很多争论，但我们认为，如果金额很高，因为它是一种可变薪酬，这反映了结果是存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if you look at 2023 where results of our companies have been good the the overall compensation the variable compensation has been very rewarding for everyone so we believe that what is important is to be clear with your objectives in the way you compensate which is what we feel we are what we also um observe is in some ways the better you do the more compensated you are and so there is a lot of debates about the quantums yeah but in some ways we believe that if the quantums are high as it's a variable pay that is a reflection that the results are there.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 另一方面，我们也认为重要的是要有一个一致性，这种一致性是中长期的。我们不仅期望我们公司的高管和领导层持有我们公司的股份，而且我们还认为，如果我们能够拥有更广泛的所有权基础，这是我们一直在公司中做的，那么拥有这种一致性非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah on the other hand we also think it's important that we have an alignment and that alignment is a medium long-term alignment M and we expect not only the executives the leadership of our companies to own shares within our companies but we also believe that if we can have a broader based ownership which is what we have been doing in our companies it is really important to have that that alignment.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 正如您所知，我们对这些事情非常透明。对我们来说，重要的是这些方案是长期的、基于股权的、基于结果的，而不是脱离行业标准的。所以，您可能会继续在这些事情上得到反对票，但是……

<details>

<p class="english-text">well as you know we are very transparent about these things and and the important thing for us is that the uh the packages are long-term they are Equity based they are result based um and and not kind of to stand out from industry um standards so we'll so so you may continue to get over against vote on these kind of things but uh but we we are grown up people but I.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 但我认为 Nikolai，这与我们完全一致。您 100% 一致。不同之处在于，我们会做得比行业标准更多，因为我们认为，如果您在行业中表现出色，您也应该获得更高的报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Nikolai that's exactly aligned uh with us you are 100% aligned the difference is we would do more than industry standards because we feel that if you overperform within your industry you should also be overcompensated.</p>

### 法拉利的激情与电动未来

**Nikolai**: 谈到全速前进，法拉利。我发现当您谈到法拉利时，您的笑容与谈论其他公司时不同。那么，法拉利有什么特别之处？

<details>

<p class="english-text">talking about um uh full speed here Ferrari I see when you talk about Ferrari you know you you you you smile differently from uh some of the other companies we talk about here so what's so special with Ferrari?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 法拉利关乎激情。法拉利关乎公司所拥有的三种灵魂。它是一家汽车公司吗？法拉利不是一家汽车公司。那它是什么？法拉利是一家非常特殊的公司。所以它超越了伟大，它超越了一家伟大的公司，它是一家特殊的公司。它的根源在于赛车，非常强大。它生产的跑车令人难以置信。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Ferrari is uh is about passion uh Ferrar is about uh being able in the free Souls that the company has is it a car company Ferrari is not a car company what is it Ferrari is a a very special company so it's beyond great it's beyond a great company it's a special company and it roots in racing a very strong the sports cars that it does are incredible.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 并且向生活方式领域的所有不同领域开放，这为许多人提供了许多机会，让他们能够在生活中拥有法拉利，不一定每个人都能拥有一辆我们的汽车。

<details>

**Nikolai**: 法拉利对意大利人意味着什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">what does Ferrari mean to an Italian?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 法拉利代表着我们国家能够取得的成就，也证明了我们是一个拥有令人难以置信的能力和创造力的国家。在赛车界也有一种竞争精神。我们一周前在摩纳哥赢得了比赛，**Charles Leclerc**（摩纳哥一级方程式赛车手）在自己的国家首次获胜，摩纳哥是一场非常重要的比赛，这些都是令人难以置信的欢乐时刻。

**Nikolai**: 您明年将推出第一款电动汽车。我曾试图让您给我看一张照片，但您不愿意。我想如果您那样做了，您可能需要把我灭口。但是，它会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you are launching your first electric car next year and I tried to get you to show me a picture which you didn't want to I think you needed to kill me afterwards if you did but uh what is it going to look like?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 它看起来会与您期望的完全不同。对我们来说，电动汽车是一块空白画布，它让我们能够利用电力和电子世界的新技术，真正能够创造和设计出一款非常不同的汽车，这令人无比兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's going to look like nothing you would expect it to look like right and for us the electric car is a white canvas which allows us to use new technologies from the electric and the electronic world and to really be able to create and design a car which is very different and that is incredibly exciting.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为，到目前为止，汽车行业尚未充分探索这些新技术所能提供的可能性领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think the the industry as of now has not yet explored the realm of possible that these new technologies can can provide us.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

<p class="english-text">so tell me you sat inside the car what did you experience?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 这是一种非常不同的体验。Nikolai，我们法拉利正在努力做的是，真正充分利用我们所能获得的优势，尤其是在您考虑可以获得更多空间时，这种空间将是特殊的。我可以告诉您，它会是不同的特殊，而且驾驶起来会非常非常有趣。

<details>

</details>

**Nikolai**: 您还有 **Jony Ive**（英国设计师，曾任苹果公司首席设计官）也在法拉利与您合作，他是著名的苹果设计师。他贡献了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you have not Johnny Ives uh also working with you at Ferrari who was the famous Apple designer what does he contribute?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: Jony Ive 和 **Marc Newson**（澳大利亚工业设计师）共同创立了 **LoveFrom**（一家创意设计公司），这是一个创意集体。我们法拉利是一家非常有创造力的公司，设计非常重要。设计、工程和财务之间总是存在对话。Nikolai，您很清楚，您总是需要让数字可行。Jony 和 Marc 的贡献非常积极，因为他们教会了我们其他的思考方式，他们教会了我们对硬件和软件的其他理解。

<details>

</details>

**John Elkann**: 作为 **Apple Watch**（苹果公司生产的智能手表）的架构师，它至今是传统机械模拟产品转变为电子和数字产品的最成功案例。所有这些对于我们思考和规划构建这款汽车的行动都非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

</details>

**John Elkann**: 此外，与他们在加利福尼亚州合作，我们在马拉内罗，我们之间的交流、讨论，我们想要实现但又无法实现的梦想，这都是一次非常振奋人心的经历。它给法拉利带来了巨大的乐观和勇气，让我们思考我们的未来，未来不仅会有我们伟大的内燃机和现有的 12 缸混合动力发动机，不仅在赛车领域有我们的 V6 混合动力，还有我们的跑车和将于 2025 年开始亮相的电动汽车。

### Stellantis、电动汽车市场与意大利科技投资

**Nikolai**: 您在 **Stellantis**（跨国汽车制造商）中整合了其他一些汽车品牌，比如标致、菲亚特等等。您在这里正在做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some of the other car brands you've um grouped together in stantis so that's P Fiat uh and so on what are you working on here?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: Stellantis 拥有 14 个品牌，现在加上我们最近宣布的 **零跑汽车**（Leapmotor: 一家中国电动汽车制造商），它有 15 个品牌，零跑汽车是我们在中国的一家纯电动汽车公司。我们正在非常努力地工作。Stellantis 致力于在电动汽车领域实现规模化成本竞争力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">stantis has uh 14 and now 15 brands with with leap Motors uh which we recently announced which is our fully electric car company in China we're working very hard stantis is very committed to be able to be cost competitive at scale in electric vehicles.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think you'll get there I mean is it possible to beat the Chinese in EV?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为我们正在接近，我认为这是一个非常令人兴奋的挑战。我们还相信，有了零跑汽车，我们现在也进入了中国电动汽车市场，顺便说一句，中国电动汽车市场在 2023 年售出了超过三分之二的电动汽车，甚至有更多的电动汽车在中国制造。

<details>

</details>

**Nikolai**: 欧洲人能在电池技术上竞争吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">can the Europeans compete in Battery Technology?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我认为欧洲人必须竞争。汽车由许多不同的部件组成，其中也包括电池。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the Europeans have to compete and the way in which the car is is composed is of many different uh components of which also batteries.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai**: 谁将在欧洲的电池领域表现出色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">who is going to do well in Europe on the battery side?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 电池是一个重要的组成部分，也是最昂贵的组成部分之一。因此，重要的是要确保在开发这些新技术的过程中，无论是在化学还是在电池组装方面，您都能够找到具有成本竞争力的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ba B batteries are an important component and one of the most uh expensive one so the the importance is really to try and make sure that as you develop these new technologies both in chemistry and and and actually in in assembling these batteries you're able to find cost competitive uh Solutions.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我相信将会有一个非常广泛的产品。Stellantis 拥有 **ACC**（Automotive Cells Company: 一家由 TotalEnergies、Stellantis 和 Mercedes-Benz 合资成立的电池制造商），这是一家与道达尔能源（TotalEnergies）和梅赛德斯（Mercedes）的合资企业，正在欧洲的德国、法国和意大利建设电池工厂。我们与 LG 和三星在北美建立了强大的合作伙伴关系。因此，我们认为在当前阶段，对于原始设备制造商（OEM）来说，能够获得他们控制的电池，除了他们购买的电池之外，这一点很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe that there there's going to be a very broad um there's going to be a very broad offering uh stellantis has ACC which is a joint venture with total energy and Mercedes which is building batteries in Europe in Germany in France and in Italy and we have strong Partnerships with LG and Samsung in North America so we think it's important in this stage for an oem to have access to batteries that they control in addition that than to the ones that that they buy.</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我觉得制造电动汽车不仅仅是电池，这才是应该集中精力的地方，无论是在工程、制造还是整体产品方面。我们正怀着极大的热情看到 **菲亚特 500 电动版**（Fiat 500 electric: 菲亚特 500 的电动版本）的成功，它在中国制造，取得了令人难以置信的成功。像 **雪铁龙 Ami**（Citroen Ami: 雪铁龙生产的一款小型电动四轮车）这样的小型汽车，以及 **菲亚特 Topolino**（Fiat Topolino: 菲亚特生产的一款微型两座电动车），这是一款可以在城市中心驾驶的两座汽车，都非常成功。如果我们考虑我们道奇（Dodge）品牌历史上拥有的肌肉车，它们也正在电动化，这充分展示了我们在品牌范围方面的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel that building an electric car is more than the battery and that's where a lot of the concentration should be going both in terms of engineering manufacturing and the overall product is is one that we're starting to see with great excitement the Fiat 500 electric which is built in in chin has been incredibly successful smaller cars like the Citroen Ami uh the the Topolino fat poino which is a two-seater which you can drive in urban centers is is very very successful and if we think about the muscle car that we historically have with with our Dodge brand uh that are also going electric that was a big demonstration of what we can do in terms of our range of Brands.</p>

</details>

**Nikolai**: 嗯，祝您好运。现在，我们继续保持快节奏。您还拥有一家足球俱乐部，尤文图斯。您拥有它已经 100 年了。为什么您要拥有一家足球俱乐部？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well um good for you um now um um staying in the fast line here you also have a football club so Juventus you owned for 100 years why why do you own a football club?</p>
</details>

### 尤文图斯的百年传承与体育精神

**John Elkann**: 尤文图斯是由我的曾祖父收购的，他对足球非常热爱，对他的社区也非常热爱。他觉得这很重要，他花了很多时间在尤文图斯身上。在 20 世纪 30 年代，有一个历史性的时刻，尤文图斯凭借一支不可思议的球队连续赢得了五次冠军，那是我祖父年轻的时候，他对足球产生了难以置信的热情。

<details>

**Nikolai**: 您会去看所有的比赛吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you go to all the matches?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 我会去看很多比赛。我的孩子们很幸运，他们成长在一个尤文图斯连续九次赢得冠军的时期。所以，就像我的祖父一样，他们实际上是在尤文图斯取得非凡成就的时期长大的，所以他们对足球充满热情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I go to many matches and my my children were very fortunate to grow up in a period where Juventus won nine championships in a row so as my grandfather they actually ended up growing up with Juventus uh having extraordinary results so they're incredibly passionate.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you learn anything from um running a football club that you can apply in all the parts of the business?</p>
</details>

**John Elkann**: 足球俱乐部是由人组成的，足球俱乐部是由竞争组成的，足球俱乐部是由有限的资源组成的，您需要努力以最佳方式利用这些资源。体育运动，尤其是足球俱乐部，有许多领导特质。因此，正如我们的公司渴望成为高绩效公司一样，您肯定会在像职业体育这样的高绩效环境中学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a football club is is made of people a football club is made of competing a football club is made of resources that are limited and that you need to try and and use in the best way there are many leadership uh traits that Sports and particularly football club have and so as as our companies aspire to be high performing companies you definitely learn in in high performing environments like like professional sport is.</p>

### 投资创新与意大利的未来

**Nikolai**: John，您在一些高科技产业，比如人工智能等领域的直接投资较少，但我了解到您是通过风险投资系统进行投资的。

<p class="english-text">John you are less represented in some of the high-tech Industries and it Ai and so on in terms of direct Investments but I but I gather you are investing through uh Venture Capital systems so I.</p>

**John Elkann**: 我们相信医疗保健是一个关键行业，在经历了疫情之后，我们对此有了更深的认识，我们人类是多么脆弱，医疗保健对于我们未来的生存是多么重要。尤其如果您看看我们在提供正确医疗保健方面日益增长的成本，我们相信这些问题将需要解决方案。我们一直非常关注赋能者，我们相信飞利浦是一家在解决这些问题方面非常出色的公司。

**John Elkann**: 我们宣布将建造一艘法拉利船，它将是一艘没有发动机的船。对我们来说，开展一个内部项目非常重要，我们可以利用我们在空气动力学方面的能力，并研究我们如何能够飞行，因为即将出现的新船都带有 **水翼**（foils: 船体下方的翼状结构，在高速时能将船体抬离水面，减少阻力）。

**John Elkann**: 并且创造一种竞争精神。**Giovanni Soldini**（意大利著名航海家），在过去十年中，我与他合作过单体船、多体船，现在又合作这个新项目，他拥有令人难以置信的经验。内部对尝试从零开始建造一些不存在的、将会飞翔且不依靠发动机驱动的东西，这种兴奋程度也非常重要，它体现了我们法拉利公司对未来的思考方式。
