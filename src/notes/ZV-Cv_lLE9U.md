### 节目开场：一场关于“雪鸟”南飞的激辩

Steve Paikin: 大家好，我是 Steve Paikin，我们现在在安大略省纽马基特的 Upper Canada 购物中心，为我们名为《TVO Today Live》的节目开启第三季。我们这次的主题是：**雪鸟**（Snowbird: 指在冬季前往美国等温暖地区避寒的加拿大人，通常是退休人士）们今年冬天是否应该放弃去更温暖的美国？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, I'm Steve Pacin and we are here in New Market, Ontario at the Upper Canada Mall to kick off season 3 of the program we call TVO Today Live. Our subject this time, should snowbirds skip going to the warmer United States this winter?</p>
</details>

一年前，没有人会考虑这样的问题。但今天，当然，很多人都在思考。我们非常感谢能够在 TVO 制作这个系列节目，并且必须感谢威尔逊基金会的慷慨支持。Red Wilson，我知道您在看，我想感谢您以如此精彩的方式帮助支持我们在这里为探讨民主和公民参与所做的工作。所以，非常感谢您，Red Wilson。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A year ago, nobody would have considered such a question. But today, of course, lots of people are. We are really grateful to be able to do this series on TVO, and we have to thank the generous support of the Wilson Foundation for doing so. Red Wilson, I know you're watching, and I want to thank you for the way that you have really wonderfully helped supported the work that we do here in the interests of discussing democratic and civic engagement. So, thanks so much, Red Wilson.</p>
</details>

我们很高兴地欢迎两位热心的朋友，他们将就今天的话题展开讨论。他们是：Laura Babcock，前商会执行董事，现为时事评论员及《The O Show》主持人。还有 Peter Sherman，他是安大略省立法机关前进步保守党成员，也是一位广播员，他的昵称过去是、现在是、将来也永远是“终结者谢尔曼”。就是他。请为这两位鼓掌好吗？感谢他们今天来到这里与我们在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we are delighted to welcome two hearty souls who are going to engage on the issue of the day. And here they are. Laura Babcock is a former Chamber of Commerce executive director, now a current affairs commentator and host of the O show. And Peter Sherman is here. He's a former progressive conservative member of the Ontario legislature and a broadcaster whose nickname was and is and ever shall be the Shermanator. That's him. Can I have a hand for these two, please? for coming up to be with us here today at the ball.</p>
</details>

我确实想说，我们也非常渴望听到在座观众的意见，因为你们来这里不只是当“盆栽”的。你们将尽最大可能参与我们即将进行的讨论。所以现在就开始思考你们想为今天的对话贡献什么问题或评论吧。我们将立即让你们参与进来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do want to say we are very anxious to hear from this audience as well because you are not just here to be potted plants. You are going to participate as best you can in the discussion that we are about to have. So start thinking now about questions andor comments that you would like to contribute to our conversation today. And we're going to put you to work right away here.</p>
</details>

我将先提几个问题，了解一下现场的看法，然后我会描述一下情况，因为有些人在通过播客收听，他们看不到。所以我会描述一下有多少人举手。问题一：我们对唐纳德·特朗普感到愤怒。而表达我们对他恶劣行为不满的一个好方法，就是加拿大雪鸟们今年冬天不去美国。谁同意这种观点？请举手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to do just a few questions off the top to get a sense of the room and then I'm going to describe because some people are listening to this on podcast and they won't see it. So I'm going to describe sort of how many hands are going up here. Question one, we are mad at Donald Trump. And a good way to show our unhappiness with his awful behavior is for Canadian snowbirds not to go to the US this winter. Who agrees with that sentiment? Hands up.</p>
</details>

好的。我看到房间里大部分人都举手了，我想是的。好吧，我们再试一次。另一次举手表决。加拿大是个寒冷的国家。我们去不去，特朗普根本不会在乎。如果我们不去，只会给我们自己带来不便。所以，去也没关系。同意这个观点的请举手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I am looking at most of the hands up in the room, I think. Okay, let's try this again. Another show of hands. Canada is a cold country. Trump isn't going to care one way or another whether we go. We're only inconveniencing ourselves if we don't go. So, it's okay to go. Hands up on that one, please.</p>
</details>

哇。非常非常少。Laura，这简直是你的主场。好的。嗯，现场有谁对这个问题真的还没决定吗？我能看看有多少人举手吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Very, very few. This is a home game for you, Laura. Okay. Um, is there anybody in the room who is genuinely undecided on this issue? Can I see some hands on that?</p>
</details>

只有零星几个人举手表示尚未决定。好的，Peter，看来你还有机会说服一些人站到你这边。还有几个问题。这里有多少人现在是或者曾经是雪鸟？你们冬天去过南方。我看到后面有一些人举手。哦，好的。很多人举手。我猜大概有一半到三分之二的人举手了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A small smattering of hands of people are undecided. Okay, Peter, you've got an opportunity, it would seem, to convince some people, uh, to come your way. Uh, couple of more questions here. How many people here either are or have been snowbirds in the past? You have gone south during the wintertime. I'm seeing some hands at the back. Oh, okay. Lots of hands. I'm guessing here about half to twothirds of the hands went up on that one.</p>
</details>

### “雪鸟”群体画像：谁是南飞的加拿大人？

Steve Paikin: 如果可以的话，我们继续，先建立一些基本共识。我想请 Stephen 站起来，因为我想介绍一下你。你是 Snowbird Advisor 和 Snowbird Advisor Insurance 的总裁。Stephen Fine，感谢你今天过来。你住的地方离我们 TVO 不远，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let us uh continue if you will to establish a bit of baseline. And I'm going to get Stephen stand up if you would because I want to introduce you here. You are the president of Snowbird Advisor and Snowbird Advisor Insurance. Stephen Fine, thanks for coming up today. You live you live not too far from us at TVO, right?</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 一点也不远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not far at all.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的。感谢你来到纽马基特。我们先来基本了解一下今天讨论的对象。如果可以的话，请描述一个典型的雪鸟是什么样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, thanks for coming up to New Market. Let's just do some basic understanding of what we're talking about today. Describe a typical snowbird, if there is such a thing.</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 嗯，一个典型的雪鸟，这取决于你问的是谁。有不同的定义，但我们会说，通常是退休或半退休的人，年龄在55岁以上，会在冬季前往温暖的目的地，停留1到6个月。通常从10月开始，在次年4月的某个时候回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, a typical snowbird, it depends who you're talking to. There are different definitions, but we would say someone who's typically retired, semi-retired, uh, usually 55 plus and will go away to warm weather destinations for between 1 and 6 months over the winter. Usually beginning in October and coming back in April at sometime over that period.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 人们往往会想到佛罗里达、亚利桑那。基本上就是这些地方吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You tend to think Florida, Arizona. Is that basically it?</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 嗯，其实不完全是。这两个是最大的目的地，佛罗里达排第一，亚利桑那排第二，但美国还有许多其他地方，而且我们也看到国际目的地也在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, not really actually. Those are the two big ones. Florida's number one, Arizona's number two, but there are a number of other places in the US, and we've seen international destinations growing as well.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 你现在能判断出来吗？我知道离人们传统上离开的时间还有一阵子。你能判断出人们是否正在考虑或者实际上在抵制今年冬天去美国吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you determine yet, I know we're still a little while away from the time when people traditionally leave. Can you determine yet whether people are either thinking about or actually boycotting going to the States winter?</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 嗯，现在判断还有点早。目前我们从会员那里听到了两种不同的声音。嗯，我认为今年雪鸟去美国旅行的人数会有所下降，但我不认为会像我们看到的其他旅行数据那样剧烈，那些数据显示旅行量下降了25%或30%。我们预计降幅可能在10%到15%之间，但再说一次，现在判断还为时过早。我们直到这个季节结束才能真正知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a little early to tell right now. We're hearing sentiment on both sides from our members at this point. Um, I think that we'll see some decline in US travel this year among snowbirds, but I don't think it's going to be as drastic as some of the other travel numbers we're seeing where travel's down by 25 or 30%. We anticipate it'll be more in the potentially 10 to 15% range, but again, too early to tell. We won't really know until the end of the season.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 再次，不是有意为难你，因为你可能没有具体数字，但如果10%到15%的雪鸟不去，你知道这代表多大的金额吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, not meaning to put you on the spot here because maybe you don't have a number, but if 10 to 15% of snowbirds don't go, do you know what dollar figure that represents?</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 我们没有这方面的具体金额。你知道，我们不太确定。我们不追踪这类数据，但这将是一个相当大的数目。但也要记住，传统上，大多数雪鸟都去美国。大约85%到90%的雪鸟传统上会去美国。所以如果你看到下降约10%，仍然有绝大多数雪鸟会去美国，可能在70%、75%到80%的范围内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't have a dollar figure on that. You know, we're not really sure. We we we don't we don't keep track of those kinds of numbers, but it it would be significant, but keep in mind as well, you know, the majority of snowbirds traditionally go to the US. About 85 to 90% of snowbirds go to the US traditionally. So if you see a drop of about 10%, you're still getting the vast majority of snowbirds going to the US somewhere in the 70 75 80% range potentially.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 明白了。Stephen，感谢你的帮助。如果需要，我稍后可能会再请教你。各位，为 Stephen Fine 鼓掌。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Gotcha. Stephen, thanks for your help on this. I may come back to you later in the program if need be. Stephen, fine. Everybody can have a little hand for him. Thank you.</p>
</details>

### 反方观点：安全、信号与团结——为何今年不该赴美

Steve Paikin: 好的，回到你们两位。我们来明确一下立场。Laura，你认为今年冬天去美国当雪鸟是不可以的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, back to you two. Let us establish our sides. Laura, you think it's okay to go to the States and be a snowbird this winter?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 不是今年冬天，Steve。主要有三个原因，我可以边说边详细阐述。首先是安全问题。情况每个周末都在变。我看到很多人点头表示同意。美国在其历史上首次被列入人权观察名单，因为那个国家正在发生一些令人深感不安的事情。鉴于现任政府与加拿大之间的关系似乎非常不稳定，我们每天早上醒来都不知道他们对加拿大人的态度会是怎样。我认为这是每个雪鸟和每个加拿大人都应该考虑的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not this winter, Steve. because three main reasons and I can elaborate on them as we go. The first is safety. It changes by the weekend. I see a lot of people nodding your heads in agreement. For the first time in its history, the United States is now on the human rights watch because some things are going on in that country that are deeply disturbing. And given that the relationship between the current administration and Canada seems very volatile, we don't know every morning when we wake up what the sentiment will be towards Canadians. I think it's something that every snowbird and every Canadian should consider.</p>
</details>

第二是信号。我有一家名为 Power Group 的传播公司，我总是教我的客户，你必须在噪音中发出清晰的信号。我们知道，现在有太多来自美国的噪音，对吧？它占据了我们的生活。所以加拿大试图发出的信号，和我对受威胁的孩子们说的信号是一样的。现在，我们的主权和经济正受到威胁。我对我的孩子们说，当恶霸威胁你时，你要尽早、经常、并且始终地站起来。你发出一个清晰的信号，并且不要改变它。那么，如果一百万雪鸟飞往南方，带去数十亿的旅游收入，这会发出什么信号呢？这会干扰加拿大试图发出的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing is signal. I have a communications company called Power Group and I always teach my clients, you got to send a clear signal through the noise. And we know there is so much noise going on coming out of the US, right? It takes over our lives. So the signal that Canada is trying to send is the same signal that I say to my kids if they're threatened. Right now, we're being threatened with our sovereignty and our economy. And I say to my kids, when a bully threatens you, you stand up early and often and always. You send a clear signal and you do not change that. So what signal does it send? If a million snowbirds fly south and give billions in tourism, it interrupts the signal that Canada is trying to send.</p>
</details>

最后一点，也是我最热衷的一点，是关于我们国家主权的**经济爱国主义**（Economic Patriotism: 指优先购买本国产品和服务以支持本国经济的观念）。这意味着我们必须把我们的经济放在首位。这不意味着民族主义，即我们排斥世界其他地方的投资。这也不意味着作为一个国家我们闭关锁国，而是意味着优先考虑加拿大制造的产品。数百万加拿大人已经做出了牺牲，包括我自己。我不能去克利夫兰和佛罗里达看望我的家人。我不能像我热爱的那样去美国旅行。我正在这样做。我正努力不购买美国产品，出于与数百万加拿大人，特别是那些在汽车行业失去工作的人团结一致的考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the last thing and the one I'm most passionate about is sovereignty to our country in the sense of patri of economic patriotism. That means that we have to put our economy first. It doesn't mean nationalism where we block out other investment around the world. It doesn't mean closing our walls as a country, but it means prioritizing Canadianbuilt products. And millions of Canadians have made sacrifices. Myself included. Can't go see my family in Cleveland and Florida. Can't do all the travel to the US that I love to do. I'm doing it. I'm trying not to buy US products out of a sense of solidarity with millions of Canadians, especially the ones who have lost their jobs in the auto sector.</p>
</details>

那会说明什么？如果我自愿决定，不是因为有什么紧急情况必须去，而是自愿去旅行，把我的钱给一个目前正在威胁和欺凌我们的国家。我做不到。今年不行。我希望所有的雪鸟都能认真思考他们的安全、他们发出的信号，以及与加拿大其他人的团结。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What would that say? If I decide willingly, not because I have to go for some emergency, but willingly to travel and give my money to a country that is currently threatening and bullying us. I can't do it. Not this year. And I hope all of the snowbirds give a long hard thought to both their safety, the signal they're sending, and solidarity with the rest of Canada. Thank you.</p>
</details>

### 正方观点：个人选择与情感纽带——赴美过冬的理由

Steve Paikin: 安全、信号、团结。Peter，我们确实提到了，这看起来有点像 Laura 的主场。你想尝试提出相反的论点吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Safety signal. Solidarity. Peter. We did mention it looked like it was going to be a bit of a home game for Laura here. You want to try making the opposite argument?</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 哦，我甚至都不想试。不，我确实想试。事实上，我有过六七年当雪鸟的独特经历。而且，原因完全与想晒太阳无关，是因为一个意想不到的孙子的出生。四年前，我们在佛罗里达卖掉了房子，决定顶住风暴，留在加拿大，待在寒冷中。但底线是，在我们买房的时候，我的医生对我说：“你知道，你正在进入我们所说的‘老年’阶段。那是年纪大了。你还不老，但你不再有规律地工作了。你也不想工作了。”我得告诉你们，我现在离78岁还有三周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I don't even want to try. No, I I do want to try. As a matter of fact, I have the unique experience of having been a snowbird myself for six or seven years. And uh for a a reason that had absolutely nothing to do with wanting to be in the sun, the birth of a grandson who was unexpected. uh four years ago we sold in Florida and decided to weather the storm and stay in Canada and be in the cold. But the bottom line is around the time we bought my doctor said to me, you know, um you're getting to be what we describe as elderly. That's older. You're not old, but uh you're not working regularly anymore. You don't want to. And I might tell you I'm three weeks away from being 78 now.</p>
</details>

所以，逃离寒冷的想法吸引我。和我的社交圈子在一起的想法也吸引我，他们大多数人都在那边。看看我住的地方，是北约克的一个公寓大楼，楼里很多人都和我年龄相仿。夏天，我们能见到每个人，因为大家都在游泳池周围聚集。冬天，他们就消失了。事实上，我们已经看到一些人动身了，看着他们的车被装上卡车，或者他们自己开车。他们正在离开，整栋楼都空了，我们整个季节都见不到他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the the concept of getting out of the cold appeals to me. The concept of being with my social peers, most of whom are down there, u also appeals to me. If I take a look at where I live, it happens to be a condo complex in North York where a lot of the people in the building are of similar age to me. In the summer, we see everybody because they're gathered around the pool. In the winter, they disappear. In fact, we've already seen some people take off, watch their cars go on the truck or them get in if they want to drive. Uh, and they're they're going the the building empties out and we don't see them for an entire season.</p>
</details>

所以，我同意 Laura 的说法，你必须穿透噪音，抓住信号。对我来说，噪音是每个人都在谈论美国是否安全。听着，我们去佛罗里达，那里60%的人车里有枪。现在他们是一个可以公开持枪的州。至少你知道谁有枪。但底线是，我们知道哪里该去，哪里不该去。我们喜欢穿轻便衣服，全年都穿短裤。这是我们想去的原因，我认为这与唐纳德·特朗普或金钱成本关系不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I agree with Laura when she says you have to make sure that you cut through the noise and get onto the signal. The noise to me is what everybody is saying about whether the United States is safe. Look, we went to Florida. 60% of people there have guns in their cars. Now they're an open carry state. At least you know who has one. But the bottom line is we knew where to go and we knew where not to go. Um we like the idea of wearing light clothing, staying in shorts year round. That's our reason for wanting to go and I don't think it has much to do with Donald Trump or the cost of money.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 但需要明确的是，你这个周末会去南方吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But just to be clear, you will go south this weekend.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 如果可以的话我会去。我已经不是雪鸟了。所以我会去佛罗里达，但只会待一两个星期。我们会住在亲戚家。这是我应该说的另一件事。雪鸟们经常选择在有很多朋友和亲戚的地方定居。南佛罗里达就是我们有很多朋友和亲戚的地方。无论我们是不是雪鸟，也无论美国和加拿大之间是否有争执，或者美元汇率是否是1.40，我们都会去那里。所以在一月或二月的某个时候，你会发现我在博卡拉顿的 Glades Road 上的镇中心闲逛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I would if I h I'm not a snowbird anymore. So I I will go to Florida, but it'll be for one or two weeks. We'll stay with relatives. And that's another thing I should say. Snowbirds often locate in areas where they have many friends and relatives. South Florida is a place where we have many friends and relatives. And regardless of whether we were or weren't snowbirds, and regardless of whether there were a tiff going on between the United States and Canada, or whether the dollar is going at a$140, we'd be there. So sometime in January or February, you'll find me wandering the uh the town center on Glades Road in Boca Raton.</p>
</details>

### 争锋相对：这仅仅是“小摩擦”还是“贸易战”？

Steve Paikin: 加拿大和美国之间发生的可不仅仅是“小摩擦”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a little more than a tiff that's going on between Canada and the United States.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 你可以这么说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could say that.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 你可以这么说，我刚刚就这么说了。我的意思是，这确实不仅仅是小摩擦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could Well, I just did. I mean, and and it because it is it is more than a tiff.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 是的。但在我看来，我没有投票权。所以我没有投票给特朗普，也没有投票反对特朗普。我投票给了 Carney 或者 PV，是哪一个并不重要。我是加拿大人。加拿大人去佛罗里达，去亚利桑那，去加利福尼亚。有时他们决定去更远的地方，我和我妻子也讨论过今年冬天这么做。如果我们负担得起并且有时间，我想时间会有的。也许我们会去巴巴多斯。也许我们会去巴哈马。但我们不是在抵制美国。我们对美国人民没有意见。我相信是我们的政府和美国政府有矛盾，而这类事情总会解决的，我们会在某个时候以某种方式解决，一切都会好起来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is. But the way I see it, I didn't get a vote. So I didn't vote for Trump and I didn't vote against Trump. I voted for Carney or I voted for PV. It doesn't matter which one it was. I'm a Canadian. Canadians go to Florida, they go to Arizona, they go to California. And sometimes they decide to go further a field, which my wife and I have discussed doing as well this winter. If we can afford it and the time is there, I think the time will be there. Maybe we'll go to Barbados. Maybe we'll go to the Bahamas. But we're not boycotting the United States. We don't have a problem with the people of the United States. I believe our government has a problem with the government of the United States and as these things tend to settle, we will settle at some point and in some way and it'll be okay again.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: Laura，你能谈谈那个角度吗？因为 Peter 提出了一个很好的观点。我交谈过的每一个美国人，无论是在线上、线下还是其他场合，都说：“你知道，我们对这一切感到很抱歉。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Laura, could you speak to that angle because Peter makes a good point? Uh, every American I've ever spoken to uh online, in person, whatever, say, you know, we're kind of sorry about all this. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 你知道，我们美国人对你们加拿大人没有意见。这很大程度上是美国总统和加拿大总理之间的事情。这会让你在这个问题上稍微缓和立场吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know that we Americans don't have a problem with you Canadians. very much is a president of the United States and a prime minister of Canada thing. Does that make you bevel your edges a bit on this?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 我爱美国人。事实上，尽管我们是一个加拿大的全国性亲民主播客，《The O Show》的第二大观众群体是美国人。我一直收到他们的来信，他们和我们站在一起。他们支持我们正在做的事情。他们讨厌正在发生的一切。他们讨厌这种混乱。我曾经在奥克维尔管理一个商会。我很多会员的业务都依赖于我们最大的贸易伙伴。这是毁灭性的。这不仅仅是一场小摩擦。这也不仅仅是，你知道，对软木木材征收一些关税，或者奶制品供应链的问题。这是激进的关税设置，扰乱了我们几年前在第一届特朗普政府期间辛辛苦苦达成的贸易协定，并对加拿大企业说，你们不知道是否能进入我们的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love Americans. In fact, our second biggest audience for the O show, even though we're a Canadian National Prodemocracy podcast, are Americans. I hear from them all the time and they're in solidarity with us. They're in solidarity with what we're doing. They hate what's happening. They hate the disruption. I used to run a chamber of commerce in Oakville. So much of my members business was reliant on our biggest trading partner. This is devastating. This is not just a tiff. This is just not, you know, some tariffs on softwood lumber or supply chain issues around dairy. This is aggressive tariff setting disrupting our trade agreement that we worked so hard on a number of years ago in the first Trump administration and saying to Canadian businesses, you don't know if you're going to have access to our market.</p>
</details>

你们不知道会发生什么。你们不知道我们是否会对你们可靠。你们可能早上醒来就发现所有商品都被额外征收了10%的关税。所以这叫做贸易战。这不是小摩擦。第二点是，我很想去克利夫兰看望我的家人，就像我过圣帕特里克节那样，或者去佛罗里达看望我的家人。我在德克萨斯州工作过。我喜欢去美国。这与枪支公开携带与否无关，虽然我有一个很好的纳什维尔故事可以讲。但关键在于，现在美国处于一个不稳定的位置。我们稍后可能会谈到民主和其他问题，但它绝对不像我们习惯的那样是一个稳定的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know if we're going to be reliable for you. You could wake up in the morning and find out there's a 10% extra tariff across the board. So that's called a trade war. It's not a tiff. And the second thing is I would love to visit my family in Cleveland like I do for St. Patrick's Day or go down and see my family in Florida. I've worked in Texas. I love to go to the US. It's got nothing to do with gun open carrier closed although I have a good Nashville story I can tell. But it's about the fact that right now the US is in a destabil position. And we'll probably talk later about democracy and the rest of it, but it is definitely not a stable nation the way we're used to.</p>

所以我认为对加拿大人来说，你可以爱你的美国朋友和家人。你可以通过 Zoom 和他们联系。你可以对他们说，我真希望明年能回去。但今年冬天，这是我家的做法。我们要去蓬塔卡纳，我们喜欢去墨西哥，就像去年冬天一样。还有其他地方雪鸟可以花钱，也许在回到他们非常习惯的社区之前，可以结交一些新朋友。

<p class="english-text">And so I think for Canadians, you can love your American friends and family. You can connect with them over Zoom. You can say to them, I sure hope that I'm going to be back there next year. But this winter, this is what my family does. We're going to Punchana, and we love going to Mexico like we did last winter. There are other places where snowbirds can spend their money, maybe meet some new friends before they go back to their communities they're so used to.</p>

Steve Paikin: 好的，Peter，请回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Peter, come on back.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 嗯，有趣的是你用了“不稳定”或“动荡”这个词来形容现在的美国。我想，我每周大概会和美国通三四次话，因为我们在那边有足够亲近的人，我想这么做，或者他们也想。我不认为他们觉得自己不稳定。他们中的一些人喜欢他们的总统，一些人不喜欢，但没有人觉得他们处于任何危险之中。是我们认为它不稳定。从我们的角度来看，我想我能同意这个观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's interesting that you use the word an unstable or a destabilized place right now. What I speak to the United States, I suppose, three or four times a week because we have close enough people in the states that I want to do that or they do and I don't think they consider themselves unstable at all. Some of them like their president, some of them don't like their president, but none of them feel that they're in any danger. We're the ones who think it's it's unstable. And from our perspective, I suppose I could agree with that point of view.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，如果我是雪鸟，我必须自己决定是否想去那里。以及我所感知到的那种不稳定性是否会对我造成伤害。我不认为会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Having said that, I'm the one who has to decide if I'm a snowbird whether I want to be there or not. And whether that instability that I perceive is there is going to be injurious to me. I don't think it is.</p>

### 现场声音：市长的中庸之道与民众的艰难抉择

</details>

John Taylor: 你们好吗？我是 John Taylor，纽马基特的市长。我想分享的信息奇怪地介于两者之间。嗯，也许这听起来确实像个政客。我的观点是，我认为每个加拿大人都应该尽其所能不在美国经济中消费，这包括南下过冬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How are you? John Taylor. I'm the mayor of New Market. And uh I think the message I want to share is is oddly in between. Well, maybe that sounds like a politician actually. Uh my point is is that I think every Canadian should be doing everything they can to not spend money in the US economy and that includes going south.</p>
</details>

不过，我想说的是，现在世界上有很多事情在分裂我们。所以，请体谅和善待你的邻居。不要评判他们。不要以为你知道他们的全部故事。有些人可能因为特殊情况需要或想要去美国旅行。我鼓励我们所有人探索各种不去的方法，但与此同时，让我们尽一切努力不再分裂，或者尽可能少地分裂。观点可以强烈，意图可以良好，但要减少分裂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The point I want to make though is there is a lot of things in this world right now that divide us. And so be thoughtful and kind to your neighbors. Don't judge them. Don't assume you know their whole story. There are unique circumstances uh why some people may need to travel to the United States, may want to travel the United States. I encourage us all to explore every way to not do it, but at the same time, let's do everything we can to not be divided anymore or as little as we can. Strong opinions, good intentions, but less division.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，这正是我们在这里做的。我们对问题进行激烈而引人入胜的交流，但我们都对彼此非常文明。不过，我想问你这个问题。我们这里讨论过，如果你有机会去某个地方两周，这和你自己在亚利桑那有一处房产，让它空置一整年，这真的很困难且浪费钱，是不同的。你对此有何回应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's what we do here. We have, you know, strong engaging interchange on the issues, but we're all being very civil with each other. Let me ask you this, though. We've had some discussion here about, you know, if you have a chance to go somewhere for 2 weeks, that's different from I own a place in Arizona and to have it sit there empty for the whole year is really difficult and a waste of money. How would you respond to that?</p>
</details>

John Taylor: 我认为这非常困难。我的意思是，我想到了人们的生活经历。如果我要离开两周，或者我希望是一周，我不会去美国，因为那纯粹是度假。但如果我的侄女要结婚了呢？或者，不是对我而言，但就像你说的，街对面的某个人，他们几年前刚刚投资并购买了他们梦想中的地方，他们要让它空置好几年吗？我不知道，但也许他们可以少去一些。这有点像减少你的碳足迹，我会少吃点肉，尽我的一份力。所以有些人的情况会有些不同。我认为我们都应该尽一切努力发出强烈的信号，以产生强大的影响，但让我们多一点耐心，我们并不知道邻居的全部故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think it's very hard. I mean, I think of like people and I've heard life experiences. I mean, if I'm going away for two weeks or I wish a week, uh I I'm not going to United States because that's simply a vacation. Maybe now how what happens if my niece is getting married or what happens if you know not for me but you've got it like you said somebody down the street from you they just a few couple years ago invested in and bought their dream place and are they to leave it sitting empty for years I don't know but maybe they could go a lot less it's kind of like maybe reducing your carbon footprint I I'll eat a little less meat you know and I'll try to do my part um so some people's circumstances will be a little different I think we should all do everything we can to send a strong message to impact with a strong message but let's be a little bit patient that we don't know our neighbors full story.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 说得好，市长先生。谢谢你，也感谢你今天接待我们。这太棒了。还有其他人吗？还有人想参与吗？

### 个人牺牲与国家大义：产权所有者的困境

Steve Paikin: Laura，我想让你谈谈这个问题，即去某个地方两周和拥有一处你可能已经去了四个月、投入了毕生积蓄、在你心中占有特殊位置的房产之间有很大区别。你如何处理这个难题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Laura, I think I I I I think I want you to speak to this issue of there's a big difference between going somewhere for two weeks and having a place that you might have gone to for four months that you've put your life savings into and has a real special place in your heart. How do you deal with that conundrum?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 这很艰难。这是一种牺牲。正如我的同事所说，他在那边有社区可以去探访。我的家人中也有雪鸟，他们现在从德克萨斯搬到了墨西哥。你知道，他们很享受新的文化体验，但他们不得不离开一个他们相处多年、期待去见的社区。但我认为，从长远来看，我们正处在一个前所未有的时刻。大约200年来，我们没有遇到过美国对加拿大主权的威胁。这是我们必须认真对待的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's rough. It's a sacrifice. And to my colleagueu's point, he has community down there that he goes to visit. I have snowbirds in my family who moved from their Texas location to Mexico now. Um, and you know, they're they're loving the new cultural experience, but they had to leave behind a community they were with for a number of years that they looked forward to going and seeing. But I think in the long course of things, we are in an unprecedented moment. We haven't had threats to Canada sovereignty by America in about 200 years or so. This is something that we have to take seriously.</p>
</details>

这不仅仅关系到你特定社区飞地的安全，你一直和美国人交谈。我也有来自美国的朋友。他们在自己所在的地方感觉还好，但他们不确定情况会如何保持。我也不确定随着言辞升级或情况变化，美国人对加拿大的感觉会如何继续。我们就是不知道。所以当我说不稳定时，我不是指永远糟糕。不要去美国，因为我想回去。我爱那里。我很不爽今年不能去度假。然而，我们不知道。直到我们感觉“好了，我可以回去了”，我认为我们应该像市长说的那样认真考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not just about necessarily the safety of your particular community enclave, which you talk to Americans all the time. I have friends from America. They feel okay where they are, but they don't know exactly how it's going to remain. And I don't know exactly how Americans are going to continue to feel about Canada as the rhetoric escalates or as things change. We just don't know. So when I say instability, I don't mean permanently terrible. Don't go to the US because I want to get back there. I love it. I'm bitter that I couldn't go on my holidays this year. Uh however, we don't know. And until we feel a sense of okay this is okay for me to go back I think we should give it serious thought like the mayor said</p>
</details>

但同时，这也是一种牺牲，对吧？想想汽车工人的牺牲，想想那些在美国失去了主要市场份额的小企业的牺牲。总有人在牺牲。如果转租或不能使用你的出租物业，一年不能见到你的朋友，是雪鸟们必须做出的牺牲，我认为你必须认真考虑这一点。这很糟糕，如果我能这么说的话，Steve，但现在就是这样。所以，让我们作为加拿大人团结起来。让我们不要在国内或其他方面分裂。让我们继续发出一个强大、清晰的信号，即使有时这很可怕，我们担心它会变成什么样。我们不能被欺负，我们不能退缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">also though it's a sacrifice right think of the sacrifice of the auto workers think of the sacrifices of small businesses who have lost major market share in the US there are people sacrificing all the time and if so subleasasing or not being able to use your rental property not being able to see your friends for a year is the sacrifice that snowbirds have to do I think you have to think strongly about that. It sucks, if I can say that, Steve, but it is how it is right now. So, let's be together as Canadians. Let's not divide amongst ourselves domestically or otherwise. And let's continue to send a strong, clear signal, even if sometimes it's scary and we're worried about what it's going to turn into. We can't be bullied and we can't back down.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我想进一步探究 Peter 在这个问题上的立场。也就是说，当然，当你在政界时，你会非常密切地倾听民意，了解你的选民对某件事的看法。我知道你现在正饶有兴趣地观察，加拿大人不时地在体育赛事上听到美国国歌时会发出嘘声。尽管有趣的是，在世界大赛的前两场比赛中我们没有听到任何嘘声。我们注意到这一点很有趣。你是否有一丝感觉，现在去美国在某种程度上会是不忠诚的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to sus out Peter's position a little more on this, which is to say certainly when you were in politics, you had your ear to the ground very intensely to know what your constituents believed about something. Uh I know you are watching now with interest as from time to time Canadians boo the Star Spangled Banner when they hear it at a sporting event. Although interestingly, we didn't hear any of that in the first two games of the World Series. We noticed that was that was of interest. Um is there a part of you that feels just the slightest bit it would be disloyal somehow to go down to the states right now.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 我有一部分感觉很生气，因为我们陷入了这种境地，但我们不是自己把自己置于这种境地的。它就这么发生了。如果我们正在进行一场关于特朗普的辩论，那会持续几个小时，但这并非本次讨论的主题。我们可以谈论这样一个事实，我交谈过的支持特朗普的美国人，我跟很多这样的人谈过，他们说：“看，我们很高兴。他说过他要做这些事。这些是需要做的事情。我们支持他正在做的事。这是我们选他来做的。”我不是在采取那个立场，但他们是，这就是为什么大多数美国人感到安全的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's a part of me that feels pissed off that we got into this situation, but we didn't put ourselves in this situation. It just happened. If we were having a debate about Trump, which would go ours and is not what this is about. We could talk about the fact that the Americans I speak to who support Trump, and I speak to a lot of those people, say, "Look, we're happy. He said he was going to do these things. They are things that needed to be done. We support what he's doing. That's what we elected him to do. I'm not taking that position, but they are, which is why Americans, for the most part, feel safe.</p>
</details>

另一方面，我最近在一艘游轮上，我们醒来的第一个早晨遇到的第一批人恰好来自他们所谓的“左岸”。我们互相介绍，他们也自我介绍。我们都谈了自己来自哪里，这是你在度假时遇到陌生人时脱口而出的第一句话。我们是来自多伦多的谢尔曼一家。他们是来自俄勒冈州波特兰的某某。你们来自多伦多。我们非常抱歉。好的。所以我很感激，但我说，你们不必感到抱歉。我想把话题带回到一个政治性不那么尖锐的对话中。

<p class="english-text">On the other hand, I've been on recently a cruise ship where the first people we met the first morning that we woke up happened to be from the left coast as they call it.

We both talked about where we came from, which is what you the first words that come out of your mouth when you meet people who are strangers on a a vacation. And uh we're the we're the Shermans from Toronto. We're the whoever they were from Portland, Oregon. You're from Toronto. We're so sorry. Okay. So, I appreciated that, but I said, you don't have to be sorry. I want to bring it back to a conversation that is less politically pointed.</p>
</details>

所以我给了你一个有条件的肯定。当然，我的耳闻告诉我，是的，我对现状不满意。话虽如此，我必须接受它。当我提到我属于被我的医生客气地描述为“老年”的类别时，我不知道我还能见到我85岁的姐夫或75岁的小姨子多少次，他们永久居住在博卡拉顿。他们来这里，我们去那里参加家庭活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I gave you the qualified yes. Of course, my ear to the ground tells me, yeah, I'm I'm not happy with the situation. Having said that, I have to make do with it. And when I mentioned that I am in the category that's described by my physician charitably as uh elderly, I don't know how many more times I'm going to see my 85year-old brother-in-law or my 75year-old sister-in-law who live where in Boca Raton permanently. They come up here, we go down there for family events.</p>
</details>

关于这一点，我给你讲两个故事。一个是我们一生中可能还能再见四次，如果我今年不去，可能就只有三次了。所以我必须记住这一点。第二件事，我们在七月有一个家庭活动，来的不仅仅是那些年迈的姻亲。其中一个女儿，我的侄女也来了。她四十出头，有三个孩子，受过良好教育，非常聪明，顺便说一句，她是在加拿大出生的双重国籍公民。她对我说，我跟她说：“你知道，现在很多加拿大人不去美国了。”她说：“也有很多美国人不去加拿大，我就是其中之一。我来这里是因为这是家庭活动。”我问：“你为什么不去加拿大？”她说：“因为它是一个只想怠慢我们的卑鄙小国。”所以，这就是另一面。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So I'll tell you two stories about that. One is maybe it's four more times in our lives and maybe if I don't go this year it's three. So I have to keep that in mind. Second thing, we had a family event in in July and more than just those aging in-laws came. One of the the daughters, my niece came. She's in her early 40s. She has three kids, very well educated, very smart, and by the way, a dual citizen born in Canada. And she said, I uh I said to her, you know, a lot of Canadians won't go to the States these days. And she said, "And there are a lot of Americans who won't go to Canada, and I'm one of them. and I'm here because this is a family event. And I said, "Why wouldn't you go to Canada?" She said, "Because it's a nasty little country that just wants to snub us." So there's the other side.</p>

Laura Babcock: 但我很高兴整天谈论特朗普，正如我的播客所显示的那样。听着，我在俄亥俄州有家人。你知道他们今年夏天做了什么吗？他们坐了几辆面包车来到我们家。整个期间，每次我们有很多人在那里。每次我走过野餐桌，他们都会说：“Laura, Laura, Laura，我们对正在发生的事情感到非常抱歉。你认为我们应该做什么？我们在俄亥俄州。”我就说：“你知道吗？就继续做你们正在做的事，对吧？”他们关心我们。他们来加拿大没有任何问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I'm I'm happy to talk Trump all day, as my podcast would indicate. Listen, I have family in Ohio. You know what they did this summer? They got in a couple of vans and came up to our house. And the entire time, every time we had a lot of people there. Every time I walked by the picnic table, they said, "Laura, Laura, Laura, we're so sorry about what's happening. What do you think we should do? We're in Ohio." And I'm like, "You know what? Just keep doing what you're doing, right? um they care about us. They had no problem coming to Canada.</p>
</details>

我还想说，如果作为雪鸟，你决定尝试其他地方，比如墨西哥或多米尼加共和国，自从所有这些疯狂的事情开始以来，我都去过这两个地方。每次他们问你来自哪里，人们说加拿大，那里的美国人、墨西哥人、多米尼加人、欧洲人都会鼓掌。他们绝对把加拿大看作是领导民主、独立、法治和公平的先锋。他们不认为我们是一个卑鄙的小国。他们把我们看作是对抗似乎非常不公平的全球贸易行为的矛尖。我得告诉你，让来自世界各地的人为你鼓掌、与你交谈，并说：“继续加油，加拿大。全世界都在关注。”感觉真的很好。

Applause from the Americans there, from the Mexicans, from the people in the Dominican, from the people in Europe who are there. They absolutely see Canada as leading the charge for democracy, for independence, for the rule of law, for fairness. They don't see us as a nasty little country. They see us as leading the tip of the spear against what seems to be very unfair global trade practices. And I got to tell you, it feels really good to have people from around the world clap for you, talk to you, and say, "Keep it up, Canada. The world is watching."</p>

### 边境风云：过关体验是变差了还是因人而异？

Steve Paikin: 我想问一下现场观众。唐纳德·特朗普在一月份成为总统。自从特朗普成为总统以来，这里有谁尝试过去美国？请举手。好的，现在举手的人很少。下一个问题。有人在过境时遇到麻烦吗？有人遇到比平时更困难的情况吗？比如一个安全官员……不，我看到很多人在摇头。没有人遇到任何困难。哦，等一下。我看到后面有一只手。先生，您能站起来一下吗？我很想听听这个故事。你喊道：“你儿子。”是的。发生了什么？

Stephen Fine: 两者兼而有之。过境时不需要采集指纹。现在，我们听说过去一周左右发生了一些事件，一些人在通过陆路边境进入美国时被要求进行**生物识别信息**（Biometrics: 指通过测量和分析人体的独特生理或行为特征来进行身份验证的技术，如指纹、面部识别等）采集。这意味着要拍照，要采集指纹。但这并非官方政策。不是每个过境的人都需要被采集指纹。不幸的是，现在边境存在很多混乱和不一致。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's a little bit of both. uh fingerprinting is not required when you go over the border. Now, we've heard of some incidents happening over the last week or so where some individuals have been required to go through biometrics when they're crossing the land border into the US. So, that would mean getting your photograph taken. That would mean fingerprinting. Now, these the this is not the official policy. Not everybody who goes over the border needs to be fingerprinted. Unfortunately, there's a lot of confusion and a lot of inconsistency at the border right now.</p>
</details>

我不想详细介绍所有不同的规定，因为我们可以花下一个小时来讨论。我们的网站上有一些相关信息。我们努力让人们了解最新情况。情况经常变化，但大多数人过境时会像过去一样正常通过，然后在美国公民及移民服务局网站上在线注册。这样做是免费的。没有生物识别要求，也不需要指纹。现在，一些加拿大人在边境要求所谓的**I-94表格**（I-94 Form: 美国海关及边境保卫局签发给外国人，用于记录其出入境信息的文件）。如果你要求这个，那么你就需要进行生物识别。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's primarily I don't want to go into all the different rules because we could spend the next hour talking about it. We have some information about that on our website. We try to keep people updated. It's changing regularly, but most uh individuals will just go across the border as they normally would have in the past and then register online with US citizenship and immigration services online. There's no fee to do that. There are no biometric requirements, no fingerprinting required. Now, some Canadians are asking for what's called an I94 form at the border. And if you ask for that, then you do need to go through biometrics.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 那是什么？I-94表格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is that? A 99 I94.</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 这是进入美国的入境记录。通常，在陆路边境你不需要它。历史上，你不需要或者它会被自动记录，但在大多数情况下，你不会被签发一个。当你去美国时，你甚至不知道过去曾被签发过。但现在如果你去要求一个，那么你就得为此付费。你将需要进行生物识别。如果你不要求，在大多数情况下，你只会通过边境，然后在另一边，如果你停留30天或更长时间，你可以注册。如果你停留时间不超过30天，你根本不需要注册。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a it's a record of entry into the US. And usually, you don't need it at the border or at at the land border. Historically, you haven't or it's been recorded automatically, but in most cases, you're not issued one. When you go to the to the US, you wouldn't even know that you were issued one in the past. Um and but now if you go down and you ask for one then you will have to pay a fee for that. You will go through biometrics. If you don't ask for it in most cases you will just go through the border and then you can register once you're on the other side if you're staying for 30 days or more. If you're not staying for 30 days or more you don't need to register at all.</p>
</details>

过去一周左右发生的情况是，有一些加拿大人报告称，美国海关和边境巡逻官员要求他们在边境获取I-94表格并进行生物识别。所以这就是现在有些混乱的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's happened in the last week or so is there have been some reported um uh incidents of Canadians where the uh US Customs and uh Border Patrol officers have required them to get an I94 at the border and go through biometrics. So that's where there's some confusion right now. So</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 而那个要求本不应该存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that requirement should not be in place.</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 它不应该存在。美国海关和边境保护局的官员不应该要求加拿大人获取I-94。

Steve Paikin: 那他们为什么这么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why are they?</p>
</details>

Stephen Fine: 我们也在试图弄清楚。确实存在一些混乱，但在大多数情况下，这种情况并没有发生，这也不是官方政策。我们正在努力从官方渠道获取声明，以便分享。但雪鸟们现在需要知道的是，如果他们要开车去美国停留30天或更长时间，就要准备好以一种你可能没有预料到的方式进行注册。所以要保持开放心态。遵循海关边境保护局官员的建议，无论是什么。不要主动要求I-94。他们可能会要求你办一个，但在大多数情况下你不需要。但我们没有听说有人在边境被拒绝入境。人们都能通过，你可能只是需要以一种你没预料到的方式注册。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're trying to figure that out as well. There is some confusion, but in most cases that is not happening and that is not the official policy and we are working through to get uh statements from official sources so that we can share that. Um, but what snowbirds need to know right now if they're going down for 30 days or more and they're driving to the US is be prepared to register in a fashion which you may not have anticipated having to register in before. So be open. Um, go along with the CBP officer's recommendation, whatever it may be. Don't ask for an I94. They may require you to get one, but in most cases you won't have to. Uh, but what we have not heard is people being rejected at the border. uh people get through, you may just have to register in a way that you hadn't anticipated before.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的，Stephen，谢谢你。我想，Laura，在特朗普时代，人们总是有可能将你在边境遇到的任何麻烦都解读为总统突然对加拿大人下达了新法令，试图让我们的生活变得困难。我的意思是，也有可能只是像往常一样，有时边境官员心情不好，把气撒在你身上。这么说是公平的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Stephen, thank you for that. I wonder, Laura, in an era of Trump, it is always possible to interpret that whatever stuff you run into at the border is because the president has suddenly put a new edict on Canadians and is trying to make our life difficult. I mean, it's also possible that it could just be what it always is, which is sometimes border officials get up on the wrong side of the bed and they're not having a good day and they take it out on you. I mean, that's fair to say, isn't it?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 有可能，但我有机会去过一些地方旅行，在欧洲和亚洲工作过，我可以告诉你，刚才听你谈论生物识别扫描之类的事情，简直是疯了。这已经不是我们过去几年习惯的那个可以随便过去逛奥特莱斯购物的美国了。谁知道呢，等到人们观看和收听这个节目的时候，情况又会变成什么样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's possible, but I have had a chance to travel a bit and worked in Europe and in Asia, and I can tell you listening to you just now talking about the biometric scan and the rest of it, it's madness. This is not the America that we pop over and go shopping at the outlet malls, right, that we've been doing for years and years. And who knows by the time, you know, people are watching and listening to this what it'll be then.</p>
</details>

你代表雪鸟组织，或者你为雪鸟做保险，而你却在谈论不理解一些人反馈回来的混乱做法，这本身就说明了问题。无论这是直接来自唐纳德·特朗普办公室，因为他醒来时心情不好，还是某个过激的边境警卫，或者是某个疲惫且不喜欢加拿大人不支持他们边境小镇本地商店的人。谁知道呢？但关键是，当我去其他国家旅行时，我从未想过这些。我去过一些地方，有点吓人，他们有自动武器，或者我们必须随身携带护照。但刚才的描述告诉我，他们不仅不配得到我们的钱，如果我们能不给他们的话，因为他们欺凌我们，威胁我们的主权和经济，以及这个国家的很多工作岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fact that you represent the organization of snowbirds or you do insurance for snowbirds and you're talking about not understanding the confusing practices that some are reporting back is the point right now. Whether it's coming right from the office of Donald Trump because he woke up angry or whether it is some overzealous border guard or whether it's somebody who's tired and doesn't like how Canadians have been, you know, not supporting their local stores across the border in the town they live in. Who knows? But the point is when I travel to other countries that never crosses my mind. I mean I've been to a few places where it's a little scary they've got automatic weapons or we had to carry our passports around. But just the description now tells me that not only do they not deserve our money if we can keep it from them because of the way they're bullying us and threatening our sovereignty and our economy and a lot of jobs in this country.</p>
</details>

而且，那感觉也不像是一个我会去的地方，除非我必须去。所以，人们需要工作，Stephen。如果人们决定不再回去，他们可能需要处理掉在那里的房产。人们可能会有家庭紧急情况。这些都取决于我们自己的良心。有时我在亚马逊上买东西，然后会想：“哦，我不该这么做。”对吧？我们不是完美的，但我们必须尽一切努力发出一个清晰的信号。我们希望安全。我们希望确保他们明白我们不高兴，我们不会被欺负。再说一次，经济爱国主义。让我们为未来建设加拿大。让我们像我们的总理说的那样，控制我们能控制的事情。我们无法控制特朗普的法令或边境警卫，Stephen。但我们可以用我们的钱来控制我们的选择。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But also it doesn't feel like a place that I would go unless I had to, you know, and so people have to work, Stephen. people have to close up maybe their their place they have down there if they decide they're not going back. People might have a family emergency. That's for all of us on our own conscience. And sometimes I buy stuff on Amazon and I go, "Oo, I shouldn't have done that." Right? We're not perfect, but we have to do everything we can to send a clear signal. We want to be safe. We want to make sure they get that we're not happy and we won't be bullied. And again, economic patriotism. Let's build up Canada for the future. Let's control, as our prime minister says, the things we can. We can't control Trump's edicts or a border guide, Stephen. But we can control our choices with our money.</p>

### 经济影响之辩：加拿大的抵制会奏效吗？

Steve Paikin: 你提到了钱，我想做伍德沃德和伯恩斯坦建议的事，那就是“顺藤摸瓜”（follow the money）。在追查钱之前，我想先重申一下，提醒大家我们现在在安大略省的纽马基特，市长也在这里。John Taylor 今天决定露面，我们对此表示感谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned money, and I want to do what Woodward and Bernstein suggested, which is follow the money. Before we follow the money, I want to rerack here for a second because I want to remind everybody that we are here in New Market, Ontario, and the mayor is here. How about that? John Taylor decided just to show up today. We're grateful for that.</p>
</details>

我们现在在 Upper Canada 购物中心，我得说这里绝对是……我们是在一个周日下午。今天这里人声鼎沸。我一度以为我到了 Yorkdale，人太多了。总之，我们正在讨论雪鸟今年冬天是否应该南下，或者留在这里是否更好，以此作为我们对唐纳德·特朗普目前对加拿大所作所为的反感的体现。这些是我们正在探讨的一些问题。Peter Sherman 和 Laura Babcock 都在这里。我们边走边看。正如我所说，我们想追查钱的去向。现在，我想公布一些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're in the Upper Canada Mall, which I got to say is absolutely We're here on a It's a Sunday afternoon. It is booming here today. I thought I was at Yorkdale for a second. It's so busy. Anyways, uh we're talking about whether or not Snowbird should go south this winter or whether or not it would be better to stay here. As if that were a registry of our antipathy for what Donald Trump is doing to Canada right now. These are some of the issues we're exploring. Peter Sherman is here. Laura Babcock is here. And we're figuring this out as we go. And as I say, we want to follow the money. Now, here's some numbers I want to put on the record.</p>
</details>

根据美国旅游协会的数据，加拿大游客为美国注入了约200亿美元，其中很大一部分当然来自雪鸟。然而，美国是一个30万亿美元的经济体。即使在佛罗里达州，加拿大人在每年7500万游客中也只占170万。所以 Peter，你先说，然后我请 Laura 回应。如果我们照 Laura 的建议做，鉴于这些数字，那边会有人注意到吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is according to the US Travel Association. Canadian travelers inject about $20 billion into the United States and a lot of that, of course, is from snowbirds. However, the US is a $30 trillion economy. And even in Florida, Canadians only make up 1.7 million of 75 million annual visitors. So Peter, start with you and then I'll get Laura to come in. If we do what Laura suggests, given these numbers, is anybody going to notice down there?</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 是的。那个在我以前住的博卡拉顿街角开熟食店的家伙会注意到，因为他为加拿大人服务，没有加拿大人，他就会受损。但受损的就是这样的人。美国的整体经济不会受损。我认为特朗普很清楚这一点，这就是为什么他能扮演他正在扮演的恶霸角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. The guy who runs the deli down the street from where I used to live in Boca Raton because he services Canadians and without Canadians, he winds up getting hurt. But that's who gets hurt. the overall economy of the United States does not get hurt. And I think that's what what Trump knows very well and that's why he can play the bully that he's playing.</p>
</details>

这里的底线是 Laura 说的。这已经不是我们记忆中的美国了。不是我小时候那个可以用1.10加元兑换美元，而不是60加分的地方。不是我父母周六带我们去野餐，让我妈妈可以去买内衣或杂货的地方。也不是几年前我住在尼亚加拉湖滨镇时，我们可以去布法罗买菜，买到这里买不到的产品的地方。它不再是那样了。它是不同的东西。世界上唯一不变的就是变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the bottom line here is Laura said it. This is not the United States that we remember. It's not the United States that when I was a little kid had money that we could exchange at a$110 Canadian rather than 60 cents Canadian. Um, it's not the place that my parents took us for picnics on a Saturday so that my mother could go lingerie shopping or grocery shopping. It's not the place that just a few years ago when I lived in Niagara on the lake, we could go into our grocery shopping across in Buffalo and get products that we couldn't get here. It's not that. It's something different. The only constant in the world is change.</p>
</details>

当涉及到像生物识别这样的事情时，你刚才谈到的，生物识别是生活中的一个事实。如果你进入申根欧洲，申根区大约是欧盟的30个国家，当你进入一个国家，你就进入了所有国家。你不需要带着护照进入每一个国家。所以你去了，你在巴黎降落，或者你做你必须做的事，其中包括指纹，顺便说一句，还有照片，这正是美国人要求的。这可能是在不久的将来我们也会要求的事情。这样他们就有了记录。世界总是在变化。为什么？因为飞机可以把人带到他们想去的任何地方，然后把他们放在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When it comes to things, for example, like biometrics, which you were just talking about, biometrics are a fact of life. If you go into Shenhen Europe, Shenhen being the 30 countries or so of the EU, when you enter one, you've entered them all. You don't have to go into each one with a passport. So you go and you you land at Paris or you do what you have to do, which includes a fingerprint, by the way, and a photograph, which is what the Americans are asking for. Probably something that in the not too distant future we will be asking for. And that way they have it. The world changes all the time. Why? because airplanes take people anywhere they want to go and deposit them there.</p>
</details>

我们正在面对一个过去造成的危机，特朗普认为他正在以一种我们很多人不赞同的方式解决它，但他确实在处理它，不管我们怎么看。这是因为人们在没有经过我们正在谈论的那种面试的情况下，降落在了他们不应该在的地方。所以我对此没有特别的异议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and we're looking at a a crisis that was created in the past that Trump thinks he's solving in a way that a lot of us don't approve of, but he is attacking it however we we view it. Uh and that's as a result of people landing where they shouldn't have been without having the kind of interview we're talking about. So I don't have any particular objections to that.</p>
</details>

说到这个，当我住在尼亚加拉湖滨镇时，我经常遇到那个心情不好的家伙。这远在特朗普出现之前。如果你答错了一个问题，他会说：“这里我问问题。”而我最近的一次旅行是通过皮尔逊机场。我向一台机器出示了我的NEXUS卡。当他们叫到谢尔曼时，我们走过一个亭子，那个人说：“谢尔曼先生，祝您旅途愉快。”所以这取决于你遇到谁。就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of which, when I lived in Niagara on the lake, I often encountered that guy who got up on the wrong side of the bed. And this is long before there was a Trump. And and if you answered a question wrong, he'd say, "I asked the questions here." Whereas my most recent trip was through Pearson. I presented my Nexus card to a machine. When they called Sherman, we walked through a a kiosk and the guy said, "Mr. Mr. Sherman, have a nice trip." So you it depends on who you encounter. That's it.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我想再把那些数字给你看看，Laura。我们每年给他们200亿美元，而他们是30万亿美元的经济体。即使这里的每一个人都抵制，这对他们来说是不是九牛一毛？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to put those numbers to you again, though, Laura. 20 billion annually from us to them in a $30 trillion economy. Even if every single person here boycotted, is it a pimple on the back of an elephant?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 在我的前三个论点中，我从未提及经济论据。如果你还记得，我谈到的是安全、信号和团结。这是有原因的，因为我们对他们来说只是沧海一粟，但他们对我们的经济却是倾盆大雨，对吧？所以，如果我们说“你知道吗，即使只有200亿美元”，这会发出什么信号？让我们谈谈这200亿美元对加拿大经济的影响。如果你在这个国家旅行，如果你去看看你从未去过的地方，如果你把那些钱投入到加拿大的商店。改变你的购物习惯。寻找本地农场购买食物。远离那些大型美国折扣店。寻找加拿大的。所以当钱花在我们自己身上时，这是一件非常重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I never mentioned the economic argument in my top three. If you recall, I talked about safety, signal, and solidarity. And that's for a good reason because we are a drop in their bucket, but they are an entire waterfall to our economy, right? So what signal do we send if we say you know what even though it's only$20 billion dollar uh maybe that's $20 billion let's talk about the impact on Canada's economy if you travel this country if you check out places you've never gotten to if you pump those dollars back into Canadian stores. Change up your purchasing habits. Find local farms for your food. Stay away from the a big American discount stores. Find Canadian ones. So the money when it's on us is a big freaking deal in this.</p>
</details>

### 主权警报：超越经济的深层威胁

Laura Babcock: 但我想谈谈一些我们还没有充分触及的事情，我从一开始就很坦诚。我说过这是我最热衷的一点。那就是他们不仅仅是在用贸易战威胁我们的国家。我们经历过贸易战。我们理解。我们和特朗普1.0政府有过艰难的重新谈判。这次是对我们主权的持续威胁。这不仅仅是特朗普在挑衅我们。相信我，我可能比今天在座的每个人都更常上社交媒体。我一眼就能看出一个好的挑衅者。但这不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I want to talk about something that we haven't touched on enough in my mind and I was honest off the top. I said it's the one I'm most passionate about. And that is they're not just threatening our country with a trade war. We've been through trade wars. We understand that. We had a hard renegotiation with Trump.1. What this is is a constant threat to our sovereignty. And it is not just Trump trolling us. Trust me, I'm probably on social media more than everyone here today. I know a good troll when I see one. That's not what this is.</p>
</details>

你知道，**昭昭天命**（Manifest Destiny: 19世纪美国的一种信念，认为美国被赋予了向西扩张至横跨北美大陆的使命，有时被引申为对邻国施加影响的理论）作为一个学说可以追溯到很久以前。谈论加拿大是美国的自然组成部分。**门罗主义**（Monroe Doctrine: 美国于1823年提出的一项外交政策，反对欧洲国家对美洲事务的进一步殖民或干预）很早就谈到西半球是美国的影响范围。对吧？这不是一个新概念。但唐纳德·特朗普非常擅长将离谱的事情正常化。他用开玩笑、轻松的方式一遍又一遍地说，直到它在一代美国人中变得正常化，他们看到我们的矿产，看到我们通往北方门户的通道——现在这非常有价值——并认为那是他们的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, manifest destiny as a doctrine goes way back. Talking about how Canada is a natural part of the United States. The Monroe Doctrine way back talks about how the Western Hemisphere is the sphere of influence of the United States. Right? This is not a new concept. But what Donald Trump is very good at is normalizing the outrageous. saying it over and over in a joking light-hearted way until it becomes normalized with a generation of Americans who see our minerals and see our access to the northern uh gateway which is hugely valuable now uh as as being theirs.</p>

我们现在必须为我们的孩子站出来。我有青少年，他们在这里。为了我们的孙辈，我们要说，在我们的主权受到威胁的这一刻，我们绝对不会让他们更容易地夺走我们的国家。

</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的，让我再……又一次掌声。Peter 提到他与佛罗里达有联系。这里有多少人去过佛罗里达？请举手。好的，对于在播客上收听的人来说，几乎房间里所有人都举手了。加拿大人喜欢去佛罗里达。无论是为了蓝鸟队的春季训练还是其他什么，加拿大人在那里花了很多时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let me do Again with applause again. Peter mentioned he's got a connection with Florida. You're getting Were those the kids applauding for you? I don't know. How many people here have been to Florida? Hands up. Okay, for those listening on podcast, pretty much every hand in the room went up. Canadians love going to Florida. Whether it's for spring training for the Blue Jays or whatever, Canadians spend a lot of time there.</p>
</details>

我还有一些数据想分享。这里有多少人去过奥兰多？请举手。同样，大概80%的人举手了。这是根据奥兰多旅游局的数据。这是佛罗里达中部的旅游局。通过大家去奥兰多或佛罗里达，你们为奥兰多地区每个家庭减轻了7474美元的地方税收负担。如果扩大到奥兰治县，一个更大的区域，每个家庭的税收负担减少了超过10000美元。佛罗里达州长说：“我希望加拿大游客和巴西游客补贴本州，让佛罗里达居民少交税。”他本该说“更少的税”，但德桑蒂斯先生在语法上不太行，所以没关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I got some more numbers I want to share. This is how many people have been to Orlando specifically? Hands up. Again, probably 80% of the hands went up here. This is according to visit Orlando. This is the tourism bureau for Central Florida. By everybody going to Orlando or Florida, you are reducing the local tax burden by $7,474 per household in the Orlando region alone. If you broaden it out to Orange County, a bigger area, the tax burden is reduced by more than $10,000 per household. The governor of Florida says, quote, "I want Canadian tourists and Brazilian tourists subsidizing the state and making it so a Florida residents pay less taxes." He should have said fewer taxes, but Mr. Dantis isn't great on the grammar there, so that's okay.</p>
</details>

好了。我们显然，Peter，当你看到30万亿美元经济体中的200亿时，那并不算多。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. We we clearly Peter are you know as you look at 20 billion in a 30 trillion economy that's not all that much.</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">I understand why the governor is saying what he's saying. Having said that we're assuming that we're all going to stop going and when we all stop going those numbers that you quoted will disappear and the burden on those particular cities will be extreme.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 顺便说一句，这代表所有游客。不，我们不会全都消失。

<p class="english-text">That's everybody incidentally represents all tourists. No, we're not all going to disappear.</p>

Peter Sherman: 没错。所以，我不知道人们决定今年抵制迪士尼世界（也就是奥兰多）或其他该地区的景点会带来什么结果。这是暂时的。他们将不得不忍受，就像我们的总理告诉我们的那样。我们将不得不做出牺牲。事情就是这样。这是变化的本质。我们正处于变化之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. So, I don't know what it's going to be as a result of people deciding they're going to boycott Disney World this year, which is Orlando, or some of the other attractions that are in that area. It's temporary. They're going to have to suck it up the same way our prime minister has told us. We're going to have to make sacrifices. That's just the way it is. And and it's the nature of something that changes. We're in change.</p>
</details>

Laura 提到了特朗普是一个因素，他当然是这次变化中的因素，并且正在以一种戏剧性的方式改变事物。我认为他非常清楚自己在做什么，也知道自己想实现什么。他谈了一段时间，并拿第51个州来挑逗我们。他们不可能成立第51个州，因为他们的国会永远不会通过。我们也不可能成为第51个州，因为我们必须重启1982年的《权利与自由宪章》。所以不会有第51个州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Laura brought up the issue of of Trump being uh a factor and of course he is in this change and changing things in a dramatic way. I think he knows exactly what he's doing and I think he knows exactly what he wants to achieve. He talked for a while and teased us about a 51st state. They can't do a 51st state because their Congress would never pass it. We can't do a 51st state because we'd have to open up the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms. So there's not going to be a 51st state.</p>
</details>

他想要的是一个北美堡垒。道格·福特也经常谈论同样的事情，他最终会得到它，因为我们曾经有过。基本上特朗普一直这么说。我们接受了它。我们生活在防御保护伞下。我们没有说谢谢。我们只是这么做了。他不想我们再搭便车了。你可以喜欢或不喜欢，但这是事实。所以他想在这一切中引发的变化，他还想与墨西哥签订一份与加拿大不同的独立贸易协定。为什么？因为与这两个国家的贸易组成部分不同。所以他正在朝那个方向努力。我认为他也会得到那个。最终，如果我们预测到特朗普总统任期结束时，别都鼓掌……三年，我们可能会发现其中一些是积极的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What he wants is a North American fortress. The same thing that Doug Ford often talks about it and he's going to get it in the end because we had it. We and and basically Trump says this all the time. We took it. We lived under the defense umbrella. We didn't say thank you. We just did. He doesn't want us to take a free ride anymore. You can like that or not like it, but it's a fact. So the change that he wants to evoke in all of this, he also wants a separate trade agreement with Mexico from the one he has with Canada. Why? Because the trade components are different with each of these countries. So he's pushing towards that. I think he's going to get that, too. And in the end, if we were to project out towards the end of Trump's presidency, don't all applaud um three years, we would probably</p>

### 终场投票与总结：民意何在，未来何去何从？

Steve Paikin: 我想问你，你的观点非常清晰，但我想知道，这是一个庆祝能够强烈反对而不失风度的节目。你会对此进行忠诚度测试吗？比如，如果我发现我的一个朋友要去美国，我可能会停止和他说话。你会这么做吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I want to ask you just how far I mean your view on this is crystal clear, but I wonder and this is a program that you're on today which sort of celebrates being able to strongly disagree without being disagreeable. Would you put loyalty tests on this? As in, if I found that a friend of mine was going to the United States, I might stop speaking to that friend. Would you do that?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 绝不。因为不是我们挑起了这场争斗。为什么要为此互相争吵呢？对吧？因为没有通过某种纯洁性测试而对彼此生气，这对我们有什么帮助？我反对任何形式的纯洁性测试，Stephen。我认为人类要复杂得多。这更多是关于策略。我是一名策略师。那么，战略上该怎么做？那就是在我们可以牺牲的地方做出牺牲，向这个政府发出一个清晰的信号。尽管我的同事认为特朗普实现他的一些目标是不可避免的。我不相信必然性。我相信策略。

<p class="english-text">Never. Cuz we didn't pick this fight. Why fight with each other about it, right? I mean, h how does that help us to be mad at each other for not passing some purity test? I am against purity tests in everything, Stephen. I think humans are much more nuanced. It's more about being strategic. I'm a strategist by work. And what is the strategic thing to do? uh it is to sacrifice where we can to send a clear signal to this government that even though my colleague here thinks it's inevitable that Trump's going to get some of his ends. I don't believe in inevitability. I believe in strategy.</p>
</details>

当有人说不可能成为第51个州时，我说，嗯，那是在我们遵循常规的情况下。但正如你所说，变化会发生。我们现在正看到美国运作方式的变化。国会几乎没有履行其职责，第三个分支，司法部门也没有。他们会阻止特朗普再次当选总统吗？显然，已经有计划要找到一种方法让他继续留任。所以，我喜欢中期选举一切都翻转的想法。我喜欢特朗普在两届任期后离开的想法，就像在美国应该的那样。我喜欢这一切都是一个大笑话的想法。但在我看到证据表明这确实是一个笑话之前，我不会坐在这里无动于衷。我会为我的国家每一天都奋斗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when it's said that it can't be a 51st state, I say, well, that's not if we use the norms. But to your point, change happens. And we're seeing change right now in the US and how they're operating. Congress hasn't really done much of its job and neither has the third branch, the judiciary. Are they going to prevent another Trump presidency? Apparently, the plan is in place to find a way to keep him there. So, I love the idea of everything flipping in the midterms. I love the idea of Trump leaving after two terms, as one should in the US. I love the idea of this all being a big joke. But until I am seeing evidence that it is in fact a joke, I am not going to sit here and be blasze. I'm going to fight for my country every damn day.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我想再深入一点，看看现场观众中是否有更多的细微差别。你们中的大多数人，绝大多数人，当我一开始问这个问题时，你们都说现在不会去美国。让我把问题再细化一点。加州怎么样？纽约怎么样？马萨诸塞州怎么样？这些都是蓝州。这些不是投票给特朗普的州。这会让你改变主意吗？这里有多少人会想，我不想去佛罗里达。我不想去亚利桑那。我不想去中西部。我不会去深南部。但蓝州，可以。请举手。

Most of you, the vast majority of you when I asked the question off the top, would you go to the United States right now all said no? Let me refine the question a little bit more. What about California? What about New York? What about Massachusetts? These are blue states. These are not states that voted for Trump. Would that make you change your mind? How many people here would think, I don't want to go to Florida. I don't want to go to Arizona. I don't want to go to the Midwest. I won't go to the deep south. But the blue states, that's okay.

Laura Babcock: 当我深为敬佩的加文·纽森站出来时。没错。加拿大人在这里为加州州长欢呼。当他发布一个视频说：“来吧，加拿大。我们是加州。你们爱我们。我们爱你们。”对。我说，你知道，恕我直言，我爱加州，去过很多次。这不是重点，加文。你知道，我们支持你的州，但我们需要团结一致，反对那个特朗普政府不公平的贸易做法。问题不在于此。

我必须说，Stephen，预料到事情可能会这样发展，我老实说没有预料到我们现在看到的像ICE突袭那样的暴力事件，我无法想象。但是，我的女儿，我本打算带她去纽约市，我地球上最喜欢的地方，也许是为她16岁生日。我在选举前一个月，她14岁时就带她去了，以防万一我几年内都不能带她去。我不想让她错过美国最好的样子。当你在一个美丽的周六晚上站在时代广场，感受世界的能量、多样性，我希望她能体验到美国最好的一面。

Um, but I my daughter, I was going to take her to New York City, my favorite place on earth, maybe uh for her 16th birthday. I took her at 14 the month before the election just in case I wasn't going to be able to take her for a few years. And I didn't want her to miss America at its best.

How many would accept it if it was awarded to you?</p>

Steve Paikin: 不，我没有。这个节目将在11月播出，但我们录制这期节目时，正值蓝鸟队在世界大赛中输给洛杉矶道奇队第二场比赛的第二天。今天这里有些人还穿着蓝鸟队的装备。但是，是的，我想现在国内有很多讨论，一些人知道去洛杉矶买黄牛票看多伦多的比赛实际上可能更便宜，因为道奇队总是在比赛中，那里的票不那么抢手。这里是。所以你刚才提出的问题是真实的。不，我口袋里没有票，但这是真实存在的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I don't. This will air in November, but we are sitting here recording this the night after the Blue Jays lost game two to the LA Dodgers in the World Series. And some people have got their Blue Jay paraphernalia on here today. But yeah, there's a lot of discussion I think in the country right now among some who know that it actually might be cheaper to to scalp some tickets for Toronto and go to Los Angeles and see them play there because of course the Dodgers are in it all the time and it's not the hot ticket there. It is here. So this is a real what you've just raised. No, I don't have any tickets in my pocket, but it's a real thing.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 但这些都是我们问自己的问题，你知道，我准备为什么打破我的诺言？我像我的同事一样坚定地支持加拿大，但我不会跳起来大喊大叫。我曾在安大略省立法机构任职多年，并为此大声疾呼，我不是在告诉你我有多了不起。我只是在说有一个现实。现实是我可能想在洛杉矶看一场那样的比赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But these are the kinds of things that we ask ourselves, you know, what what is it that I'm prepared to break my word for? Um, I'm I'm as strong for Canada as as my colleague is, but I I'm not going to jump up and down and rave about it. I've served in the Ontario legislature and raved about it for plenty of years, and I'm not I'm not telling you what a great guy I am. I'm simply saying there's a reality. The reality is I might want to see one of those games in Los Angeles.</p>
</details>

现实是，当他们举办赛季揭幕战时，我知道这将在11月22日播出，当他们在10月底举办赛季揭幕战时，他们请来了一个名为“火焰之声”的不可思议的合唱团，并由法瑞尔·威廉姆斯为那些不知道的人制作了一场表演。我观看了有史以来最精彩的两国国歌演唱，没有听到一声嘘声。美国人和加拿大人一直都是这样。他们现在是这样，他们都应该是这样。我敢说，总有一天会再次如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reality is that when they ran the season opener, and I know this is airing on November the 22nd, when they ran the season opener, um, in late October, they brought a an incredible choir called The Voices of Fire and put together a a show by Farel Williams for those who don't know it, one of the World Series. Yeah. And I watched the I watched the most amazing renditions of both national anthems ever, and I didn't hear one blue. That's the way Americans and Canadians have always been. It's the way they are and it's the way they all should be. And I I dare say will be one day again.</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 我可以回应一下吗？嗯，我相信你不是在指我上蹿下跳、大喊大叫，因为我今天或以往任何时候都没有这样做。不过，我认为我们必须清楚我们正在牺牲什么。我愿意去洛杉矶看一场蓝鸟队的比赛吗？百分之百愿意。我愿意去纳什维尔狂欢吗？如果你没去过，那里真的很有趣，我非常想念它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">May I just respond? Um I'm sure you weren't referencing me about jumping up and down and raving because I have not been doing that today or ever. I do think though that we have to have some clarity about what it is that we are sacrificing. Would I love to go to a Jay's game in LA? 100%. Would I love to go to Nashville and party? If you haven't, it is so much fun and I desperately missed it.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 你确实说过要给我们讲一个纳什维尔的故事。那是什么故事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You did say you were going to promise us a Nashville story. What was that about?</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 你知道，这实际上是几年前的事了，当时拜登还在任，可能是拜登任期的第三年，我们刚到纳什维尔。我们当时在一家很棒的酒吧，和一位服务员聊天，他实际上是从纽约来的纳什维尔人。我们谈到了拜登政府和特朗普，你知道，我是一个政治评论员，这是我的工作。几分钟后，经理过来说：“你们不能在这里谈论那个。”我们都愣了：“什么？”他们说：“嗯，我相信当时是允许公开持枪的，但纳什维尔是一个相当民主的城市，但在周边地区……”他们说：“这个酒吧里有人仅仅听到加拿大人谈论拜登就变得激动起来。”而我们甚至没有特别挑衅。那是在吃早餐，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, this is actually several years ago when Biden was still in office, maybe the third year of Biden's term and we had just arrived in Nashville. We were at this wonderful bar and we were chatting up with one of the servers who was actually from New York in Nashville and we got talking about the Biden administration and Trump, you know, I'm a political pundit. It's what I do. Uh, and after a few minutes the manager came over and said, "You can't talk about that here." And we're like, "What?" And they said, "Well, this is, I believe at the time it was open carry, but Nashville is, you know, fairly democratic city, but around." They said, "There are people here in this bar who are getting agitated just listening to Canadians talk about Biden." And we weren't even being particularly provocative. It was breakfast, right?</p>
</details>

但我对经理说：“美国作为言论自由的堡垒，发生了什么？”我的意思是，那一向是这个国家的招牌，从一开始就是。而我们坐在这里，甚至不能和招待人员进行一次礼貌的早餐对话，因为太危险了。就在那一刻，我感觉，哇。所以我们谈论的这种变化不仅仅是关于生物识别和技术。它是那个国家里，我们很多人在加拿大习以为常的东西正在被冷却。直到美国回到一个你可以谈论总统而不会感到被恐吓的地方，我才回去。无论是世界大赛的门票还是世界上最好的音乐会，都必须是非常紧急且对我家人来说非常私人的事情，我才会跨过那条边境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but I said to the manager, I said, "What happened to America being the bastion of free speech?" I mean that has been the calling card of this country since the get and we're sitting here and we can't even have a polite breakfast conversation with the hospitality because it's too dangerous. And it was at that moment where I was like wow. So this change we're talking about is not just about biometrics and technology. It's a chilling in that country of the very things that a lot of us take for granted in Canada. And until such time that America gets back to a place where you can have a conversation about the president without feeling intimidated, I won't be going. Whether it's a World Series ticket or the best concert in the world, it would have to take something severely urgent and personal to my family for me to step over that border.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 我理解，我也经历过和你类似的事情。所以我们在这点上没有分歧。然而，这种情况已经持续了很长时间，甚至在这里也存在。我们在尼亚加拉湖滨镇有一个好朋友，我提到过我们以前住在那里。我们最近去那里，她告诉我们她的邻居不再和她说话了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Peter, you're going to have I understand that and I've experienced the same kind of thing as you. So, we have no quarrel on it. However, that's been going on for a very long time and it goes on even here. We have a good friend located in Niagara on the lake where where, as I mentioned, we used to live. Um, we were there recently and she told us her neighbor no longer talks to her.</p>
</details>

她出生在美国，通过婚姻获得了加拿大公民身份。所以她在美国有投票权。她向她的邻居提到她投票给了特朗普，而那个邻居曾是她最好的朋友，现在从她的生活中消失了。它分裂了人们。它在感恩节餐桌上分裂人们。它在圣诞节分裂人们。它在各种我们本应团聚的时刻分裂人们。这是非常不幸的事情。你在纳什维尔的经历同样不幸。

<details>

<p class="english-text">She's an American by birth, has Canadian citizen citizenship here by marriage. So, she gets a vote in the States. and she mentioned that she voted for Trump to her neighbor who had been her great bosom buddy gone, not in her life anymore. It divides people. It divides people at Thanksgiving tables. It divides people at Christmas. It divides people at all kinds of times when we should be together. And that's a very unfortunate thing. And it's equally unfortunate that you experienced what you experienced in Nashville.</p>
</details>

但我可以告诉你，在所有这些胡闹之前，我在佛罗里达时，我们和美国人讨论过，大多数美国人，普通的日常美国人，对加拿大了解不多，但他们当时确实注意到了，因为发生了一件事，叫做渥太华车队，那个新闻传到了美国。现在加拿大每天都上新闻，因为我们每天都是受害者。昨天是额外增加10%。不知道明天会是什么。

Now Canada makes the states every day because we're a victim every day. Yesterday it was an additional 10%. Don't know what it'll be tomorrow.</p>

I will sleep better tonight than I have in 10 months, sir. Uh, and it could be my perspective is based on the fact that as a living I follow American politics very closely. And I can tell you that if this was politics as normal, I would be in agreement with both of you. Let them talk to each other. Work it out. This is all just gamesmanship. That isn't what it looks like and that isn't what we're hearing from America. I hope it's resolved. I hope conversation does it, but that's not how it looks. So, I'm going to hold what you said as a positive, optimistic potential in my back of my mind, and I'm going to act in every way I can to help my country get through this as quickly and as safely as humanly possible. But it is not just a matter of opinion. I'm not up here just opining because it's fun. I am up here warning our country that we need to do everything we can to protect our sovereignty and our economy. And I will not have it relativized. It's not relative. It's serious for me. And I want to make sure that's clear.</p>

Audience Member 4 (Moren): 嗨，我是 Moren。Laura，你其实抢了我的风头，但你是嘉宾，我不是。所以，非常感谢你。我还没成为雪鸟。希望有一天我能成为，无论是去美国还是其他地方。我现在还没到那个阶段。但我来这里是因为我知道我的观点是什么。我知道我的信念、我的价值观在哪里，但我想听听另一种观点。我认为我们是一致的。我现在可能不在你的位置，但我……

<p class="english-text">Okay. back here. Yes, ma'am. What's your name? Hi, I'm Moren. And Laura, you actually stole my thunder, but you're on the panel and I'm not. So, thank you very much. Um, I'm not a snowbird yet. Um, and hopefully one day maybe I will be, whether it's to the US or to somewhere else. I'm not at that stage right now. But I wanted to come here because I know what my opinions are. I know where my beliefs, my values are, but I wanted to hear the other perspective. And I think we're aligned. I might not be where you are right now, but I</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">No, no, no. I mean, on this, you said you're not quite where Laura is.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我在雪鸟的级别。我还没……我还在积极参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm at the snowbird level. I haven't I'm I'm still, you know, I'm still actively engaged.</p>
</details>

Audience Member 4 (Moren): 但你认为人们应该去吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you think people should go down?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，现在不行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, not right now.</p>
</details>

Audience Member 4 (Moren): 所以在这方面你和 Laura 一致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're with Laura in that respect.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的。我想我和这个观众中80%以上的人都一样。但我认为有细微差别，我认为这里有人可能处境与我不同，可能会说，你知道吗，我可能再也去不了那里了。这可能是我唯一的机会。这就是为什么我还没到那一步。但我所在的位置是，我不会故意无知或幸福地无知，随便你怎么说。我不会把头埋在沙子里。所以如果今天我们认为这不正常，这没有被正常化。尽管美国政权正试图为我们正常化它，但这不正常。所以当我们在这里时，我现在会做一些决定来保护我自己，保护我自己的国家。可能会有困难，可能会有牺牲，但我愿意做出。如果我比现在再老一点，我会有不同的看法。我会说绝对的。你知道，你可能没有我未来20、30年可能有的同样机会，但现在，我们就是这样。现在，希望一年后，它会过去。我现在没有那种感觉。我喜欢这些人的乐观，因为我更务实一点，我只想活在当下的世界里。直到那改变，我必须做我需要做的事来保护我自己和我的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I think I am with uh 80 plus% of this audience as well. But I think there's nuances and I think there are people here that, you know, might not be in the situation that I'm at and might say, you know what, I might not get down there ever again. This may be my only chance. That's why I'm not there yet. But what I where I am is I am not willfully ignorant or blissfully ignorant, whatever. I'm not putting my head in the sand. So if today we think that this is not normal, this is not normalized. Although the US regime is trying to normalize it for us, this is not normal. So while we're here, I'm going to make some decisions right now to protect myself, protect my own country. And there may be hardships, there may be sacrifices, but I'm willing to make them. If I was a little bit older than what I am right now, I would have a different perspective. And I would say absolutely. You know, you may not have the same opportunities that I might have in the next 20, 30 years, but right now, this is where we're at. Now, hopefully a year from now, it will pass. I'm not feeling that right now. I love the optimism of these people because I'm a little bit more pragmatic and I'm just going to live in the world right now. Until that changes, I have to do what I need to do to protect myself and to protect my country.</p>

Audience Member 5 (Dave): 嗯，我有点不舒服。不，我对一些最小化美国威胁实际影响的说法感到非常不舒服，说我们会和美国人民相处得很好，那会治愈一切。我不认为现在的情况，来自美国的态度，与以往有任何不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, Dave. Good to meet you. Um, I'm a little bit uncomfortable. No, I'm getting greatly uncomfortable with some of the minimization minimizing the impact of what the American threat actually is and and saying, well, we're going to get along well with the American people, and that's going to heal it all over. I don't think the situation now, the attitude from the United States is any different than it always has been.</p>

Steve Paikin: 你不认为现在的情况和以往有任何不同？

<details>

<p class="english-text">you don't think the situation now is any different than it's always been?</p>
</details>

Audience Member 5 (Dave): 不。这一直是他们的目标，就是同化。威廉·莱昂·麦肯齐·金在阿尔塔会议后警告加拿大人，我们最大的威胁仍然来自美国，他们从未放弃同化加拿大的目标。我认为这一直是他们的主要推动力。也许现在的总统给了人们更多表达和行动的许可。当然，经济政策、贸易政策都在推动这一点。正如特朗普自己所说，他想在经济上征服加拿大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. This has been the goal all along is to assimilate. William L McKenzie King after the Alta conference warned Canadians that our biggest threat is still from the United States who've never given up on their goal of assimilating Canada. And I think that's been the perpetual thrust. Perhaps the current presidency there has given more license to people to be able to express it and act on it. And certainly the policies, the economic policies, the trade policies are pushing that. As Trump himself has said, he wants to conquer Canada economically.</p>

Steve Paikin: 那么你通常冬天会去美国吗？

Audience Member 5 (Dave): 不，今年冬天肯定不去。我们偶尔会去拜访朋友，看望家人，在奥兰多有朋友或家人。我们以前会去拜访。我们现在不这么做了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">No, for sure not this winter. We've gone down occasionally to visit friends, to see family, had friends in Orlando or family in Orlando. We used to visit. We're not doing that anymore.</p>

Steve Paikin: 这次不行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not this time.</p>
</details>

Audience Member 5 (Dave): 我们不能。那种认为美国人真的很好相处的观念……嗯，我们仍然知道那里超过一半的人支持这些现行政策。当我们说我们没有感受到任何威胁、任何暴力、任何ICE的后果时，我注意到我们所有说这话的人都是白人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can't. And that's the uh the concept that uh Americans are really good to get along with. Well, we still know over half the people there support these current policies. And when we say where we're not feeling any of the threat, any of the violence, any of the repercussions of ICE, I notice all of us saying that are white.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的，我们进入最后阶段了。在我们结束之前，有几件事。好的，这是一个你正在参与的节目，叫做《TVO Today Live》，我们基本上一年中每个月做一次。本质上，这是一个关于民主参与的节目，你们今天来到这里就是一种参与。所以我想在我们结束时问几个问题，看看有多少人改变了主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, Dave, thank you for that contribution. Okay, we are in the home stretch here. Let me just see here. Um, couple of things before we finish. Okay, this is a you're on a show here called TVO Today Live and we do this basically once a month during the course of the year. And essentially at the end of the day, it's a show about democratic engagement, which you're all doing by being here today. So I want to want to just ask a few questions as we wrap things up to see I want to see how many people here have changed their minds.</p>
</details>

我能看看那些一开始未决定的朋友吗？请举手。那些一开始未决定的朋友，你们人数很少。一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八、九。是的，很少。你们中有多少人在听了这次讨论后，现在和 Peter Sherman 站在一起，同意他这边的辩论？请举手。一、二、三、四、五。好的。六、七。好的。你们这些未决定的人中有多少现在和 Laura Babcock 站在一起？一、二、三、四、五。六。哇。你们俩几乎平分了今天未决定的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Can I see the people who were undecided at the beginning? Put your hands up. Those of you who are undecided at the beginning, there were a very few of you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine. Yeah, very few. How many of you having heard this discussion are now with Peter Sherman and you agree with his side of the debate? Hands up please. One, two, three, four, five. Okay. Six, seven. All right. How many of you undecideds are now with Laura Babcock? One, two, three, four, five. Six. Wow. You guys both sort of persuaded almost equally the undecideds here today.</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 我们还是有点影响力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a little bit of sway.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的，很少。还行。还行。你相信这一刻吗？有多少人相信这个问题和这一刻正在加剧我们两国之间的两极分化？请举手。手放下。有多少人像 Dave 说的那样，情况一直这么糟，现在并不比以往更糟？一个。好的，这个压倒性地倒向了一边。好的。嗯，好的。我们要在哪里结束呢？让我们做最后一次举手表决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, very little. Not bad. Not bad. Do you believe this moment? How many people believe this issue and this moment is adding to the polarization between our two countries? Hands up. Hands down. How many people say kind of what Dave said, it's always been this bad and this is no worse than ever? One. Okay, that's gone overwhelmingly one way. All right. Um All right. Where are we going to finish here? Let's do one last one a final show of hands here.</p>
</details>

雪鸟们今年应该放弃去美国吗？你们听了一个小时的辩论。谁说“是”，他们应该放弃？请举手。手放下。谁说“不”，去也没关系？请举手。手放下。你对过去一个小时里现场气氛的变化有什么感觉？有人有看法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should snowbirds skip going to the United States this year? You've heard an hour of debate. Who says yes, they should skip? Hands up. Hands down. Who says no, it's okay to go? Hands up. Hands down. What's your sense about how the room has moved in the last hour? Anybody got a view on that?</p>
</details>

Peter Sherman: 我不认为有太大变化。总的来说，当你一开始问这个问题时，情况看起来就差不多是这样，坦白说，这也和我预期的差不多。看，如果我们阅读大众媒体，采纳我们看到的统计数据，80%的加拿大人厌恶特朗普，并因此避免去美国。所以如果我看这样的观众，我应该看到这种反映，我确实看到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think it's moved that much. I I think generally speaking when you asked the question at the outset it looked about like that and it frankly was the way I expected it to be. Look if we read the popular press and we take the statistics that we're seeing 80% of Canadians detest Trump and and are avoiding the United States because of it. So if I look at an audience like this I should see that reflected and I do.</p>
</details>

Laura Babcock: 你知道吗？我同意，情况会和人们进来时一样，因为我们对此有强烈的感受，对吧？我们对此有充分的了解。我们经历过。我们看到了汽车行业的失业。我们看到了头条新闻。我们感受了10个月的痛苦。作为加拿大人，第一次感觉到我们的主权受到威胁，这难道不困难吗？已经200年了，对吧？独立战争、1812年战争，是上一次这种昭昭天命被付诸行动。中间有一些小事，但没有像现在这样公然的。而且它直接来自世界上最有权力的办公室。这很有压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know what? I I I agree it was going to be the way it is when people walked in because we have strong feelings about this, right? We have informed opinions about this. We have experienced it. We've seen the job losses in the auto sector. We've seen the headlines. We've felt the pain for 10 months. Has it not been difficult to be a Canadian for feeling for the first time that our sovereignty is under threat? It's been 200 years, right? the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the last time that this manifest destiny has been put to action. There have been some little things in between, but nothing as overt as right now. And it's coming directly from the most powerful office in the world. It has been stressful.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为今天进来的每个人，Steve，都对这个问题有一定程度的投入。我认为重要的是，展望未来，不是每个人都像你们一样，在一个美丽的周日下午如此投入地参与民主。如果有一件事我能试着留给这群观众，那就是你们需要谈论它。沉默不会让我们的国家更安全。你需要和你的美国朋友谈。你需要和那些不关注政治的朋友谈。你需要对他们说：“你意识到正在发生什么以及对我们经济的后果吗？你意识到你的选择以及这可能向一个非常关注信号和媒体的政府发出混合信号吗？你意识到了吗？如果你没有，我很乐意告诉你我的感受，听听你的感受，并建立一种非常诚实、开放和充满爱的关系，因为我们是加拿大人。我们就是这么做的。所以，请这样做。通过互相交谈来为民主本身而战。谢谢。”

<p class="english-text">So, I think everyone coming in here, Steve, was feeling a certain level of commitment to the issue. What I think's important though is going forward, not everybody is as engaged on a beautiful Sunday afternoon as you are with their democracy. And if there's one thing that I can try to leave this audience with is that you need to talk about it. Silence doesn't make us safer as a country. You need to talk to your American friends. You need to talk to your friends who don't follow politics. You need to say to them, "Are you aware of what's happening and the consequences to our economy? Are you aware of your choices and how that might be sending a mixed signal to an administration that pays very close attention to signal and to media? Are you aware? And if you're not, I'd be happy to tell you how I feel about it, hear how you feel about it, and have a very honest, open, and loving relationship because we're Canadians. That's what we do. So, please do that. Fight for democracy itself by talking to each other. Thank you.</p>

Steve Paikin: 我们的时间到了。所以，在我们今天结束之前，我们要说一些感谢的话。首先，最重要的是，我要感谢你们所有人，在一个周日下午来参加这个节目。今天你们本可以做一百万件其他的事情。你们能来到这里，真的要为自己的公民参与和准备在电视上讨论一个有争议的问题而给自己鼓掌。所以，向你们致敬。给自己鼓掌。
