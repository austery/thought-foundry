### 欢迎与激进投资的定义

大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金的尼古拉·坦根（Nicola Tangan），今天我们荣幸地邀请到了一位投资界的传奇人物——保罗·辛格（Paul Singer），他是埃利奥特管理公司（Elliott Management）的创始人，也是全球最重要的激进投资者。保罗，热烈欢迎您。

<p class="english-text">hi everybody I'm Nicola tangan of the Norwegian so wealth fund and today we are hosting an investor Legend poll singer who founded Elliot asset management and probably the most important activist investor in the world PA warm welcome thank you.</p>
</details>

什么是激进投资？激进投资是指主要通过持有公司**股权证券**（Equity Security: 代表公司所有权的股票或其他权益工具）的头寸，并试图与公司进行接触，以改善结果、控制或影响结果，从而释放价值。

<details>

<p class="english-text">what is activist investing activist investing is taking a position largely in an equity security of a company um and trying to um engage with the company to uh improve outcomes control or influence outcomes better outcomes um to unlock value.</p>
</details>

这可能涉及要求管理层变动、**资本结构**（Capital Structure: 公司融资的构成，包括债务、股权等）调整、财务策略和战术，以及任何能让公司赚更多钱、更好地定位、更理性地部署资产的措施。

</details>

### 激进投资的必要性与市场趋势

为什么你们必须这样做？公司难道不自己做这些吗？众所周知，从**主动投资**（Active Investing: 投资者积极管理投资组合，试图跑赢市场）转向的趋势，我这里所说的“主动投资”不一定是激进投资，它仅仅意味着你打开你所投资公司的邮件，试图弄清楚情况，理解公司策略，也许你会打电话给公司提出一些建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why do you have to do this don't companies do this themselves well as you know the U uh Trend away from active investing and by active investing I don't necessarily mean activist active investing just means um you open the mail from the company that you in which you invest you try to figure it out you try to uh understand the company strategy and maybe you'll call the company up and L in some suggestions but U active investing is next to passive investing or index investing.</p>
</details>

但是，主动投资与**被动投资**（Passive Investing: 投资者不积极管理投资组合，而是通过指数基金等方式跟踪市场表现）或**指数投资**（Index Investing: 投资于跟踪特定市场指数的基金）相对。现在，指数投资在全球管理资金，特别是股权资金中占据了多数。

### 埃利奥特的投资方法与公司反应

你们通常会采取哪些步骤？我们的一些步骤非常实际。我们从各种来源获取想法，这得益于我们在市场中的地位。有时人们会给我们带来想法，有时**华尔街**（Wall Street: 泛指美国金融业和投资银行）会给我们带来想法，有时我们自己也会挖掘想法。我们做的第一件事是一个迭代过程，我们会针对每个行业提出一套不同的问题，并逐一解答这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what kind of steps do you take some of the steps are very um um praic we develop ideas from a variety of sources given our position in the marketplace um sometimes uh people bring us ideas uh sometimes the street brings us ideas um uh sometimes we faret out ideas ourselves U the first thing we do is in an IT iterative process um we develop a set of questions different from every uh in every industry and run down the questions uh we talk to a lot of people former employees uh uh customers uh Wall Street analysts um uh a consequence parenthetically of uh the trend towards index investing is that there's less coverage research coverage from Wall Street and when I say Wall Street I mean the global U uh uh Investment Banking firms uh in firms that Supply research but we try to become as as informed as possible we try to ascertain the uh local um uh landscape in terms of culture in terms of uh the culture of capitalism uh and U the culture of corporate uh control corporate change um we try to understand the board of directors and the management how do how how they got there um um what their strategies are what why they're failing.</p>
</details>

我们与很多人交谈，包括前员工、客户、华尔街分析师。顺便提一下，指数投资的趋势导致华尔街（我指的是全球投资银行公司和提供研究服务的公司）的研究覆盖减少。但我们努力尽可能地了解情况，我们试图确定当地的文化、资本主义文化以及公司控制和公司变革的文化。我们努力了解董事会和管理层，他们是如何上任的，他们的策略是什么，以及他们为什么会失败。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean we don't get involved with highly successful companies that can't be improved really so what is your perfect what's your perfect situation the perfect situation is a u company and this exists um you may be surprised to hear it but uh it exists a company which has an open door and by Open Door what I mean is something's been going on for a long time um uh the founder or one generation from the founder um feels a u a moral obligation to um the local shareholders or the uh the original shareholders or the family doesn't want to give up doesn't want to give up the longstanding strategy or Corp uh capital structure or alignment or location of headquarters um uh any one of a number of uh reasons why when we come knocking um we not infrequently find a what we what I am accurately calling a an open door and in an open door it's a different discussion but if we're right I mean we're we're not always right of course on on the details of our strategies and sometimes we're just plain wrong um but um if we're right and there's um a segment an important segment of the uh the um leadership the board of directors the management um who actually agree with that then it's a then it's a u fairly smooth path to um getting things done.</p>
</details>

我们不会介入那些非常成功、无法真正改进的公司。那么，你们的理想情况是什么？理想情况是，一家公司有一个“**开放之门**”（Open Door: 投资者愿意倾听并与激进投资者合作），这可能让您感到惊讶，但确实存在。所谓“开放之门”是指，一些问题已经存在很长时间了，创始人或其后代感到对当地股东、原始股东或家族负有道德义务，他们不想放弃长期以来的策略、资本结构、联盟或总部位置等。当我们上门时，我们经常会发现一个我称之为“开放之门”的情况。在这种情况下，讨论会不同。但如果我们是对的（当然，我们并非总是在策略细节上正确，有时我们甚至完全错误），并且公司领导层、董事会和管理层中有重要的一部分人认同我们的观点，那么事情就会进展得相当顺利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how many smooth ones do you have for for the ones who are not so smooth I mean generally speaking how do companies react when pulsing or knocks on the door yeah yeah it's a very interesting question because um one thing that is um that is just crystal clear and um and endemic hardly anyone tries to stiff arm us hardly anyone there's the occasional and there's a playbook for that you know we have one firm One Fund and it's large yeah uh and we obvious like $70 billion like 72 right now 72 billion um and we have the wherewithal to to back our uh thesis and pursue our approach um so everyone almost everyone sorry picks up the phone the advisers all tell them Elliot you should pick up the phone you should engage with these people um they're deal makers we're dealmakers um uh uh and you will hear them out um and they do and so some of the approaches are under the radar screen some of the approaches um we will file a disclose a position uh others we don't disclose to the public um we disclose to the to the company that we have a position um it depends on the rules uh it depends on what what our strategy might be but um a a discussion a detailed discussion of and and a deck um my guys like writing decks like piles of paper large piles of paper yeah with uh graphs and terrible what does it mean to be a dealmaker.</p>
</details>

有多少次是顺利的呢？对于那些不那么顺利的情况，公司通常如何反应？这是一个非常有趣的问题，因为有一点非常清楚且普遍，那就是几乎没有人会试图“**硬扛**”（Stiff Arm: 拒绝合作或对抗）我们。偶尔会有例外，但我们有应对方案。我们有一家公司，一个基金，而且规模很大，目前大约720亿美元。我们有足够的资源来支持我们的论点并推行我们的方法。所以，几乎所有公司都会接听电话。他们的顾问都会告诉他们：“埃利奥特来了，你们应该接电话，应该和这些人接触。他们是**交易撮合者**（Dealmaker: 促成交易的人），我们也是交易撮合者，你们应该听听他们的意见。”他们确实会听。

<details>

<p class="english-text">well in other words we're not we're not Crusaders we're not we're not just speaking to hear ourselves speak we're not um engaged to read about ourselves in the Ft tomorrow morning um we have a we have a goal we have a thesis if our thesis is right and the company takes steps which is not always um I would say getting all of our requests is not rare but it's not dominant as the dominant outcome but um we're generally pretty right and uh uh and um the things we suggest generally are creative to u to value and so the company that engages with us it's a minority of those companies um which stiff arm us and knock down drag out proxy fights or lengthy litigations doesn't really help anybody but sometimes it happens.</p>
</details>

有些方法是秘密进行的，有些方法我们会公开披露持仓，而有些则不向公众披露，只向公司披露我们的持仓。这取决于规则，也取决于我们的策略。但通常会有一场详细的讨论和一份演示文稿。我的团队喜欢制作演示文稿，就像一大堆纸，上面有图表。成为交易撮合者意味着什么？换句话说，我们不是十字军，我们不是为了自说自话而发言，也不是为了明天早上在《金融时报》上看到自己的报道而参与。我们有一个目标，一个论点。如果我们的论点是正确的，并且公司采取了措施（虽然我们并非总是能得到所有要求，这不罕见但也不是主要结果），但我们通常是相当正确的，我们提出的建议通常能创造价值。因此，与我们合作的公司中，只有少数会“硬扛”我们，导致激烈的**代理权争夺战**（Proxy Fight: 股东通过争取其他股东的投票权来影响公司管理）或漫长的诉讼，这对任何人都没有好处，但有时也会发生。

<p class="english-text">what's the ratio of of success successful outcomes versus not so successful outcomes well since I'm going to Define successful as um we get a meaningful percentage of what we asked for and the stock reflects it not just in 20 minutes but I mean you know over a period of time that we actually our ideas actually add value yeah it's the only way we can maintain our reputation that gets the stock to to say oh Elliot's in this here's their the is nobody else has been able to unlock that key the stock is worth more and of course um it's it's not a question of short-termism because um actual short-termism doesn't add value to anyone really um but um it's it's not short-termism when the market instantly overnight or in a couple of days or a few days understands that you are adding long-term value yeah you're you're adding Enterprise Value the strategy is better your ability to compete is better and in in What proportion of the cases do you think you are adding value if you measure it in that way well the proportion of cases in which we're adding value is I believe close to 100 the proportion of cases in which it's reflected in uh action movement of structure capital structure uh Etc uh me directors um is probably this is just a guess but it's a majority it's like 70% right something something like that it's not 90 it's not 80 I think so.</p>
</details>

### 成功与价值创造的衡量

成功结果与不成功结果的比例是多少？如果我将成功定义为我们得到了我们所要求的大部分，并且股票反映了这一点，不仅仅是20分钟内，而是在一段时间内，我们的想法确实增加了价值，那么这是我们维持声誉的唯一方式。这会让股票市场认为：“哦，埃利奥特介入了，这是他们的论点，没有人能够解开这个谜题，这只股票值得更多。”当然，这不是**短期主义**（Short-termism: 专注于短期利润而非长期价值）的问题，因为真正的短期主义对任何人都没有价值。但当市场在一夜之间或几天内立即理解你正在增加长期价值时，这就不是短期主义。你正在增加**企业价值**（Enterprise Value: 公司总价值，包括股权和债务），策略变得更好，竞争能力也更强。

<p class="english-text">for instance last year you uh took action against Starbucks I don't want to be a word Smith here okay let's let's phrase it differently you didn't take but it's important because you made an investment in Starbucks it's important to to to to at least get this right in our minds uh because um the street sorry the media loves battle and they love to take down successful uh investors rich people whatever um so the colorful way that it's generally um um framed is attack okay but let's cycle back to near the beginning of our conversation this morning fewer and fewer literally fewer and fewer people are um acting like owners yeah and fewer and fewer companies are accepting the notion that the owners have anything to say um to to the management and the board it's it's kind of shocking and therefore we are among with with certainly in terms of numbers among the very a short list of people who do call uh for accountability so we and when we win um the shareholders win the the days of green mail are uh longer.</p>
</details>

以这种方式衡量，你认为在多大比例的案例中你们增加了价值？我认为我们增加价值的案例比例接近100%。至于它是否反映在行动、结构变动、资本结构变动、董事会成员变动等方面，这只是一个猜测，但可能占多数，大约70%左右。不是90%，也不是80%。

</details>

例如，去年你们对星巴克采取了行动。我不想咬文嚼字，让我们换个说法：你们没有“采取行动”，而是对星巴克进行了投资。这很重要，因为媒体喜欢“战斗”，喜欢抨击成功的投资者、富人等等，所以通常会用“攻击”这样生动的词语来描述。但让我们回到我们今天早上谈话的开头：越来越少的人真正像所有者一样行事，也越来越少的公司接受所有者对管理层和董事会有发言权的概念，这有点令人震惊。因此，我们是少数几个要求问责的人之一。当我们赢了，股东也赢了。**绿票讹诈**（Greenmail: 公司高价回购激进投资者股票以避免被收购，从而使激进投资者获利）的时代已经一去不复返了。

### 埃利奥特的绝对回报基金理念

所以，你们投资了星巴克，并启动了战略变革，他们更换了CEO，改变了策略，你们也赚了钱。你认为你们在让社会变得更好吗？这并不是我主要的政治、哲学和慈善事业的出发点，但我的确认为我们让世界变得更好了，并非在每一种情况下，但这种投资方式提高了企业服务客户的可能性和概率。竞争是好的，拥有多个渠道也是有益的。

</details>

我来告诉你这个问题最基本的答案，虽然这个问题有很多层面。最基本的是，我们有大约一百所大学、医院和慈善信托基金作为客户。我刚才提到的这些客户，之所以选择我们，是因为我们不是一个仅仅专注于激进投资的基金，其他一切都是点缀。我们是一个**绝对回报基金**（Absolute Return Fund: 旨在无论市场表现如何都能产生正回报的基金），这意味着无论市场如何波动，你都想赚钱。所以，这对于你刚才的问题的意义在于，在那些不常发生但现在已是遥远记忆的严重不利金融市场环境中，这些客户很少有真正能表现出色的投资渠道。

### 投资失利：经验与教训

有时事情并不如你所愿，那些不如意的投资有什么共同特点吗？有时是运气不好，但更常见的是我们遗漏了什么，或者**对冲**（Hedging: 采取措施以减少未来价格波动风险的策略）不当，**跟踪误差**（Tracking Error: 投资组合回报与基准指数回报之间的差异）远超预期。

<p class="english-text">I'll give you two brief examples um one moderately horrifying and the other done really really bad um the one that's moderately horrifying is um a uh a peer who will remain nameless um sold us a late stage bankruptcy in a deinking plant somewhere in the northern United States late stage denotes the ri discs are Mo mostly gone in a complicated workout bankruptcy process um uh and the deinking was their business you know waste paper and you're going to deink it and use it again and that's good for the environment it's good for the human race it's good for the Galaxy suffices to say that it wasn't late stage there were important bankruptcy elements that hadn't been settled and the deinking plant didn't really work so aside from hating the person that sold it to me um um that's just it's just a just a mistake um and we lost it wasn't that big a position but we were much smaller um and the really bad one which was that that was an Arbitrage position in Japanese index link bonds inflation link bonds.</p>
</details>

在我职业生涯的早期，从1977年到1987年左右，对冲要简单得多，因为我们做多**可转换债券**（Convertible Bond: 一种可以在特定条件下转换为发行公司股票的债券），同时做空该债券可转换成的股票。这非常直接，跟踪误差也不是一个重要因素。现在我们已经变得更加复杂，在对冲方面，我们为不同类型的交易创建定制的对冲策略。但即使是这些策略，也并非总是完全奏效。有时，最糟糕的交易是那些你误解了风险，将其归类错误的情况。

</details>

我举两个简短的例子，一个有点可怕，另一个非常糟糕。有点可怕的例子是，一位不愿透露姓名的同行，向我们出售了美国北部一家**脱墨厂**（Deinking Plant: 从废纸中去除油墨以进行回收再利用的工厂）的后期破产资产。后期破产通常意味着在复杂的破产重组过程中，风险大部分已经消除。脱墨是他们的业务，就是回收废纸并将其脱墨再利用，这对环境和人类都有好处。但事实是，这并非后期破产，还有重要的破产要素尚未解决，而且脱墨厂根本无法正常运作。所以，除了讨厌卖给我这个资产的人之外，这只是一个错误，我们亏了钱。虽然头寸不大，但当时我们公司规模小得多。

真正糟糕的交易是**套利**（Arbitrage: 利用市场价差在不同市场或不同资产之间同时进行买卖以获取无风险利润的交易）**日本指数挂钩债券**（Japanese Index-Linked Bonds: 票面利率或本金与特定指数（如通胀率）挂钩的日本政府债券）的头寸。这个套利本来是完美的。**日本政府债券**（Japanese Government Bonds, JGBs: 日本政府发行的债券）具有充分的信用支持，而我们所交易的日本政府债券的本金会根据实际**消费者物价指数**（Consumer Price Index, CPI: 衡量商品和服务价格变化的指标）变动进行调整。日本的CPI几十年来几乎没有太大变动，一直在零附近徘徊。我们谈论的是2006、2007、2008年左右，当时CPI很少会短暂跌破零，但通常是略高于零。当我们介入那笔糟糕的交易时，一个交易商向我们展示了它，并且还有其他几个人也参与了这笔交易。当时的价格意味着未来七年每年通胀率为负2%。负2%！这简直是那种让你环顾交易室，然后赶紧买入的交易，对吧？

长话短说，那笔交易从隐含的每年负2%通胀率，最糟糕时跌至每年负4.5%。简单来说，日本政府通胀挂钩债券的价格下跌了30%。我们仍然持有这笔债券，损失了巨额资金。它将在大约六年内到期，但我们已经损失了本金的30%，而且这些资产每天都**按市值计价**（Mark to Market: 根据当前市场价格对资产或负债进行估值）。这要求资金经理具备一套不同的技能。许多人被迫平仓，因为当你误解风险并以不应有的方式过度杠杆化，因为你误解了其本质特征时，可能会遭受毁灭性的损失。

我承受了很大的压力要平仓，但我坚持了下来。那是在2008年，当时有很多“不成功便成仁”的头寸。

### 风险规避的根源与资本保全的重要性

为什么不亏钱对你来说如此重要？这种风险规避来自哪里？这是一个很好的问题。埃利奥特成立于1977年，当时我大学毕业后被**哈佛法学院**（Harvard Law School: 位于美国马萨诸塞州剑桥市的著名法学院）录取，那是我父亲一生中最伟大的时刻。他是一名零售药剂师，他确信我将成为一个大人物，并且我必须学习如何投资，因为我将成为一个金融大亨。我大学主修心理学，当时我不知道为什么要去法学院，但哈佛法学院听起来不错，不妨一试。我想我的心理学背景吸引了招生委员会。

我和父亲处理我的训练方式是，他作为零售药剂师每天在药店工作12小时，我们交易投机性矿业股和科技股。我向你保证，你无法说出一种我们父子没有磨练到极致的亏钱方式，比如卖空、买入看跌期权、卖出看涨期权。我是**芝加哥期权交易所**（CBOE: Chicago Board Options Exchange，美国最大的期权交易所）的早期采用者。这最终在1974年的**熊市**（Bear Market: 市场价格普遍下跌，投资者信心低迷的时期）中导致了一场灾难性的损失。当时我做多了一些股票，我确信它们会上涨，因为我的智力，我做了研究。我用保证金持有它们，一度跌了88%。

所以，我再也不想亏钱的愿望，一部分是为了把父母的钱赚回来，一部分是那种真正的毁灭感。我损失了我的钱，还有我最好朋友的1万和2万美元。所以，当我们成立埃利奥特时，当我意识到我可以一直管理资金并赚钱时，可转换债券对冲是一个非常好的策略，服务不足，回报率高，没有真正好的估值模型，一切都是即兴的，都是基于与华尔街的关系。我刚才说的并不是你问题的全部答案。在此过程中，我观察到，当人们遭受重大损失时，他们往往会失去理智，失去判断力。当天下太平时，他们对世界现状的漫不经心，会变成当头条新闻、故事和朋友陷入困境并遭受巨大损失时的紧抓不放的黑暗。所以我知道判断力会受损。

我还知道，如果你不仅能保持头脑清醒和判断力完好无损，还能保持资本完好无损，那么在那些罕见的特殊机会时期（比如2008年最后几周），一切都变得便宜，然后又崩溃了，简直令人难以置信。如果你有这种体质上的能力，以及被允许的能力，以及额外的资本来利用这些机会，那是一件非常酷的事情。所以，如果你不损失大量资金，资本就像一个棘轮效应，你赚了一块钱，就保留它，然后尝试再赚一块。我的客户从不要求我达到某个基准，显然你必须赚一些钱。我们方法的精妙之处在于我们不以基准来衡量自己，就像我刚才告诉你的，就是不亏钱，剩下的希望是一个不错的回报率。

### 阿根廷债务重组案例

你提到了你的父亲，你还在努力让他为你骄傲吗？我知道他可能已经不在世了，但他无论如何都为我骄傲，坦白说。不，我不是为了让他骄傲而做，我之所以继续做，是因为我认为我们做得很好。这有趣吗？你觉得这有趣吗？哦，我不觉得这有趣。我觉得滑雪有趣，玩雪地摩托很有趣，帆船也很有趣。你为什么？你80岁了，如果你不觉得有趣，为什么你80岁了，为什么你做了50年，你是最成功的人之一，为什么如果你不觉得有趣还要继续做？

我经常被问到这个问题，虽然这个形式有点不同，但我之所以被问到这个问题，是因为我投入其中，我对此充满热情，我沉浸其中。如果你想想报纸上读到的东西，那些大部分都被可悲地扭曲了，那么它就不可能无聊。所以，哇，他们在埃利奥特做着各种不同的事情，没有一成不变的模式，所以充满了挑战。有时，我们从不庆祝头寸盈利，从不。你从不庆祝成功吗？不，我的意思是，我们会在邮件里说“干得好”，但没有蛋糕，没有香槟。没有蛋糕，没有香槟。但是，关于“乐趣”这个话题，我想说的是，不损失大笔资金就不会感到无聊。**倦怠**（Burnout: 因长期压力和过度工作导致的身体和精神疲惫）的原因会大大减少。你知道，这就是会发生的事情。我的意思是，这不仅仅是可怕的离婚或家庭悲剧，倦怠在很大程度上是人们因为逆境而耗尽了情感能量，因为你无法预测市场。所以，这也是我寻求永不亏钱的另一个主要原因，因为如果我想规避风险，我就必须一直规避风险。

### 当前市场风险与AI估值

年龄和经验为你的投资过程带来了什么？在我们的业务领域，如果一个人没有倦怠、无聊或能力衰退，那么经验和智慧就显得尤为重要。尤其是在当今世界，超越电子表格和那些糟糕律师所说的“你赢得那场反垄断诉讼有95%的机会”，然后你输了，你就会对所有顾问产生阴暗和敌意的想法，这种深层次的理解是如此必要。

说到这个，你们也曾与阿根廷打交道，发生了什么？阿根廷在90年代末到2000年代初，其债务开始下跌，跌到80多，然后是70多，但仍在支付。很多人认为他们会违约，但我们不这么认为。我们知道他们有违约的历史，在150年里有三四次。我们也知道他们从二战中走出来时，是世界第七或第八大经济体，所以资源丰富，能力强大。我们不认为违约是个好主意，也不认为他们会违约，但他们还是违约了。我们购买的是正常支付的债券，但债券开始暴跌。过了很长一段时间，我记不清具体时间了，他们才提出第一个方案。

主权债务重组有不同的类型，我不想过度简化，但我认为我的分类大致是正确的。有一类国家一无所有，你什么也得不到，你去追讨只会让人烦。但阿根廷是一个真正的国家。经过一段时间（我想是几年），对于主权债务重组来说，那是一段非同寻常的时期，他们提出了一个29美分的方案，也许是30美分。对于主权债务重组来说，30美分的回收方案可能适用于危地马拉、洪都拉斯或厄瓜多尔这样的国家，但我不知道。但阿根廷，25%的持有人（债券价格持续下跌）坚持不接受。该国表示，如果你不接受这个方案，你将一无所有。所以，三年后，他们在第二次尝试中多给了几个百分点，方案相同。在这两次方案结束后，大约有6万名债券持有人，其中包括大约五家对冲基金，埃利奥特是其中最大的一家。到那时，我们的成本基础已经跌到十几、二十几、三十几美分，我不知道。它一直在下跌。

这笔交易持续了多久？15年。15年！那真是相当有耐心啊。不，这不是耐心。我告诉你为什么：他们从未接受我们谈判的提议，他们从未提出过任何方案，也从未坐下来和我们谈。他们是一个例子，在公司领域也有一些这样的例子，他们就是固执、傲慢、自以为是。我的意思是，我们竟然敢去挑战他们。不，但我喜欢你不认为他有耐心的事实，因为我58岁了，我做一笔投资，我希望在73岁之前能得到回报。是的，但我们没有耐心，我们无路可走。耐心不是耐心，耐心不是比喻性地被束缚着。

### 加密市场与美元储备货币地位

今天的股市状况如何？我认为，现在的风险是我所见过的最高之一。自上次重大市场事件以来，漫长的时间让人们认为他们总是会被救助，永远不会再有1974年、1987年、2007-08年那样的熊市。**杠杆**（Leverage: 借入资金进行投资以放大潜在回报或损失）正在不断累积，风险承担也在不断增加，这些说法也适用于政府。欧洲、日本和瑞士的**负利率政策**（Negative Interest Rate Policy, NERP: 央行将基准利率设为负值，以刺激经济）以及美国长达十年的**零利率政策**（Zero Interest Rate Policy, ZIRP: 央行将基准利率设为零，以刺激经济）简直令人震惊。

在疫情期间，你们在零利率政策的基础上，又增加了惊人的**财政赤字**（Spending Deficits: 政府支出超过收入，导致预算赤字）。我们谈论的是深度衰退式的支出计划、支出赤字和支持计划，而当时并没有真正的衰退。我指的是在新冠疫情期间，以及疫情之后，今年这个财政年度，美国的GDP赤字超过6%。所以，我认为**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence, AI: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）的估值已经过高，它在为用户带来实际价值方面已经超出了其应有的水平。我的意思是，它有用途，将来也会有更多用途，但它被过度夸大了。

你如何看待**加密货币市场**（Crypto Markets: 基于区块链技术的数字货币交易市场）？我们最近提出的一个观点是，**中央银行货币**（Central Bank Money: 由中央银行发行和控制的货币）确实是凭空创造的，它并不存在。但中央银行货币的另一个事实是，它是**主权**（Sovereign: 拥有最高权力或独立地位的国家或政府）的，它有主权支持，你用这种货币纳税，用这种货币支付军队。如果政府接受这种或那种加密货币，或者所有加密货币，或者其中几种，他们就是在接受主权货币的替代品。那么，因此，由于所有这些加密货币和政府的支持，货币供应是否会变得疯狂？那么，这对美元作为世界**储备货币**（Reserve Currency: 各国央行和金融机构持有的大量外汇，用于国际交易和稳定本国货币）的潜在影响是什么？

<details>

关键在于，如果政府支持或认可加密货币，它就是美元作为储备货币的替代品。世界各国都知道，他们对美国政府作为世界中央银行和储备货币国所享有的特权并不满意，他们希望有替代品。现在，这不是很 L 趣吗？他们想要替代品。美元以其所有滥用特权的方式主宰着世界。而美国自己却在创造或支持美元的替代品，这让我感到头晕目眩。

### 个人生活与对年轻人的建议

你如何放松？滑雪、雪地摩托、帆船、徒步、骑行、音乐。为什么音乐对你很重要？我喜欢摇滚乐，我有几个乐队。所以你在乐队里演奏？嗯，键盘。真正的摇滚乐？是的，你的意思是它与嘻哈不同？不，我只是问你，它与朗尼·多尼根（Lonnie Donegan）不同吗？是的，真正的摇滚乐。很酷。你读什么书？我以前读科幻小说，但我现在主要读商业书籍和研究报告。鉴于市场如此复杂，现在这有点让人应接不暇，所以我没有时间再读小说了。

你对年轻人有什么建议？对华尔街感兴趣的年轻人，或者一般的年轻人，或者想创业的年轻人？我对这些人的建议一直以来都是不变的，那就是我重视广泛的经典**文科教育**（Liberal Education: 旨在培养广博知识、批判性思维和公民素养的教育）。他们不应该在大学里学习商科课程，他们应该尽可能多地学习历史、政治学、哲学、宗教。所以我想传达的是，你可以在商业领域专业化，商业和交易的工具，我的意思是，现在对冲基金、私募股权、风险投资、高科技等等，这都是金鹅。但是，如果你过早地专业化，你就会获得狭窄而深入的技能，而无法应对世界上实际发生的事情。所以我认为，这对我很有帮助，成为一名律师也对我很有帮助，尽管我的合伙人不是律师，但他像律师一样思考，这很好。
