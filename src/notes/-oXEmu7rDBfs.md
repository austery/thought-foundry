### 开场致辞与对埃及的赞扬

Do you want to have a couple of questions as we're having an amazing period of time, like nobody's seen before?

你们想问几个问题吗？我们正经历着一个前所未有的非凡时期。

And we have tremendous stuff, as you know, in Israel.

而且，如你们所知，我们在以色列取得了巨大的成就。

And now we're in a country where a friend of mine is a very powerful leader, and my friend is right here.

现在我们身处一个我的朋友是一位非常强大领导人的国家，我的朋友就在这里。

The President, also the General.

他既是总统，也是将军。

Sometimes I call him the General, because he's both and he's good at both.

有时候我称他为将军，因为他身兼二职，并且都做得很好。

And they've done a fantastic job, and they have very little crime because they don't play games.

他们做得非常出色，犯罪率很低，因为他们不玩虚的。

That's why they don't play games like we do in the United States with governors who have no idea what they're doing.

这就是为什么他们不像我们在美国那样，与那些不知道自己在做什么的州长们玩游戏。

I ask about crime, they don't even know what I'm talking about.

我问及犯罪问题时，他们甚至不知道我在说什么。

So it's a great tribute to this man.

所以这是对这位先生的巨大敬意。

He's done a fantastic job in bringing this country together.

他在团结这个国家方面做得非常出色。

And the United States is with them all the way.

美国将一路支持他们。

They can walk all the way.

他们可以全程走下去。

And it's an honor to be with you.

很高兴能与您在一起。

### 埃及在和平进程中的作用

Reporter: Sir, what role will Egypt play in the peace process here?

记者：先生，埃及在这里的和平进程中将扮演什么角色？

Trump: We played a very important role, and they had a very important role with **Hamas** (Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement: a Sunni-Islamist fundamentalist, Palestinian nationalist, and jihadist paramilitary organization).

特朗普：我们扮演了非常重要的角色，他们在与**哈马斯**（巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动：一个逊尼派伊斯兰原教旨主义、巴勒斯坦民族主义和圣战准军事组织）的接触中也扮演了非常重要的角色。

Trump: The fact that the General was right here was very instrumental because Hamas respects this country and they respect the leadership of Egypt.

特朗普：这位将军就在这里的事实非常关键，因为哈马斯尊重这个国家，也尊重埃及的领导层。

Trump: So you played a very important role.

特朗普：所以你们扮演了非常重要的角色。

Trump: I appreciate it very much. Thank you.

特朗普：我非常感谢。谢谢。

### 伊朗和平协议与制裁

Reporter: President Trump, in Israel just now, you were talking about a possible **Iran peace deal** (an agreement aimed at resolving conflicts and establishing peaceful relations with Iran). You said, "We are ready when you are." Is that the ultimate goal with today's signing?

记者：特朗普总统，刚才在以色列，您谈到了一个可能的**伊朗和平协议**（旨在解决冲突并与伊朗建立和平关系的协议）。您说：“你们准备好了，我们就准备好了。”今天的签署，最终目标是达成这个协议吗？

Trump: No, not Iran.

特朗普：不，不是伊朗。

Trump: But I think Iran will come along. They've been battered and bruised, and they need some help.

特朗普：但我认为伊朗会跟进的。他们饱受打击和创伤，他们需要一些帮助。

Trump: They have big **sanctions** (punitive measures taken by a country or group of countries against another country to coerce it to comply with international law), as you know, tremendous sanctions.

特朗普：如你们所知，他们面临着巨大的**制裁**（一个国家或国家集团对另一个国家采取的惩罚性措施，旨在迫使其遵守国际法），非常严厉的制裁。

Trump: I'd love to take the sanctions off when they're ready to talk, but they can't really survive with those sanctions.

特朗普：当他们准备好谈话时，我很乐意解除制裁，但他们真的无法在这些制裁下生存。

Trump: Those sanctions are very tough.

特朗普：那些制裁非常严厉。

Trump: But at some point, they're going to say, "We want the sanctions off."

特朗普：但总有一天，他们会说：“我们希望解除制裁。”

Trump: We're going to end up with — I think Iran is going to be fine.

特朗普：最终，我认为伊朗会没事的。

Trump: I know so many Iranian people. They're great people, smart, great people: engineers, lawyers, academics.

特朗普：我认识很多伊朗人。他们是很棒的人，聪明、优秀的人：工程师、律师、学者。

Trump: But they took a big hit.

特朗普：但他们受到了重创。

Trump: And frankly, if we didn't hit them with the nuclear [sanctions/pressure], I don't think you would have been able to have this incredible deal, this once-in-a-lifetime deal.

特朗普：坦率地说，如果我们没有在核问题上对他们施压，我认为你们就不可能达成这项不可思议的、一生中仅有一次的协议。

Trump: Nobody's ever seen anything like what's happening today.

特朗普：今天发生的一切是前所未有的。

Trump: And countries have all come together, all different countries.

特朗普：所有不同的国家都汇聚一堂。

Trump: Some like each other, some did, most didn't.

特朗普：有些国家彼此喜欢，有些曾经喜欢，大多数不喜欢。

Trump: And they've all come together.

特朗普：但他们都走到了一起。

Trump: Every country has come together.

特朗普：每个国家都团结起来了。

Trump: And by the way, Iran did put out a statement that they support this deal very wholeheartedly.

特朗普：顺便说一下，伊朗确实发表了一份声明，表示他们非常衷心地支持这项协议。

Trump: So that was in itself something.

特朗普：所以这本身就是一件大事。

Trump: But no, I think they want to — that's all I do in my life.

特朗普：不，我认为他们也想——我一生都在做交易。

Trump: I make deals, and they want to make a deal.

特朗普：我做交易，他们也想达成一项协议。

### 加沙的后续步骤与重建

Reporter: Can you please tell us what the next steps are?

记者：您能告诉我们接下来的步骤是什么吗？

Trump: Well, they're going and looking for bodies.

特朗普：嗯，他们正在寻找尸体。

Trump: It's a pretty gruesome task.

特朗普：这是一项相当艰巨的任务。

Trump: And they know where the numbers are.

特朗普：他们知道尸体数量在哪里。

Trump: As you know, I guess five or six are in now.

特朗普：如你们所知，我想现在已经有五六具尸体被运回了。

Trump: But they're looking for bodies.

特朗普：但他们仍在寻找尸体。

Trump: They know the areas, and they search bodies out, and they're doing it in conjunction with Israel.

特朗普：他们知道那些区域，他们会搜寻尸体，并且他们正在与以色列合作进行这项工作。

Trump: And they're going to be finding quite a few of them.

记者：特朗普总统，您能告诉我们第二阶段的谈判何时开始吗？

Trump: What started?

特朗普：什么开始了？

Trump: I mean, it started as far as we're concerned, and phase prosperity.

特朗普：我的意思是，就我们而言，它已经开始了，而且是繁荣阶段。

Trump: And the phases are all a little bit mixed in with each other, and we start cleaning up.

特朗普：而且，这些阶段都有些相互交织，我们开始进行清理工作。

Trump: If you look at **Gaza** (a Palestinian enclave on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea).

特朗普：如果你看看**加沙**（地中海东岸的一个巴勒斯坦飞地）。

Trump: There is a lot of cleanup.

特朗普：有很多清理工作要做。

Trump: That's why when I talked in my speech, I talked about the **debris** (scattered fragments, typically of wreckage or refuse).

特朗普：这就是为什么我在演讲中谈到**废墟**（散落的碎片，通常是残骸或垃圾）。

Trump: I used the word debris.

特朗普：我用了“废墟”这个词。

Trump: That's debris times ten.

特朗普：那是十倍的废墟。

Trump: So they're going to really do a job.

特朗普：所以他们真的会大干一场。

Trump: They have a lot of power.

特朗普：他们有很大的权力。

Trump: In another room.

特朗普：在另一个房间里。

Trump: And it's a very interesting group.

特朗普：这是一个非常有趣的群体。

Trump: We have like 35 countries, and that's only because they were the 35.

特朗普：我们大概有35个国家，这仅仅是因为他们就是那35个国家。

Trump: Everyone we invited came.

特朗普：然后我们邀请的每个人都来了。

Trump: So there's a lot of respect, and I think you'll see some tremendous progress in the **Middle East** (a transcontinental region centered on Western Asia and North Africa).

特朗普：所以这里有很多尊重，我认为你们会在**中东**（一个以西亚和北非为中心的跨大陆区域）看到巨大的进展。

Trump: This country is doing very well.

特朗普：这个国家做得非常好。

Trump: It has good leadership.

特朗普：它拥有良好的领导。

Trump: It's about leadership.

特朗普：这关乎领导力。

Trump: And it's really nice when you say, "How is your crime situation?"

特朗普：当你问“你们的犯罪情况如何？”时，真是太棒了。

Trump: And they don't even know what you're talking about.

特朗普：而他们甚至不知道你在说什么。

Trump: "What do you mean? We don't have crime because he is trying. He puts it out very quickly."

特朗普：“什么意思？我们没有犯罪，因为他正在努力。他很快就能解决。”

Trump: Some people think that's not nice, but I think it's great because people don't want to be mugged and smashed, and they don't want to be stupid people.

特朗普：有些人认为这不好，但我认为这很棒，因为人们不想被抢劫和殴打，他们不想成为愚蠢的人。

Trump: They have a place that is going very well.

特朗普：他们有一个运转良好的地方。

Trump: We're very proud of it because we knew each other from the beginning.

特朗普：我们为此感到非常自豪，因为我们从一开始就认识。

特朗普：我第一次见到他是在一家酒店。我正要去见他，然后希拉里·克林顿跟着我来了。

Trump: I remember Hillary Clinton, and he liked me so much he never even got to see Hillary.

特朗普：我记得希拉里·克林顿，他太喜欢我了，以至于他都没见到希拉里。

Trump: I for about 2 seconds.

特朗普：我大概只看到了两秒钟。

Trump: But he didn't really want to waste a lot of time.

特朗普：但他真的不想浪费太多时间。

Trump: We knew what was going to happen, but that was the first time we met, and we had very good chemistry together, and it continues till today.

特朗普：我们知道会发生什么，但那是我们第一次见面，我们之间有很好的默契，这种默契一直持续到今天。
