### 投资之路的起点

主持人: 大家好，我是赫林，在奥斯陆与橡树资本（Oaktree Capital: 一家全球领先的另类投资管理公司）的联合创始人、投资大师霍华德·马克斯在一起。很高兴您能来这里。您是世界上最令人印象深刻和受人尊敬的投资者之一，也因撰写各种备忘录而闻名。我们很想先问问您，最初是如何进入金融行业的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi everybody I'm herin Oslo with the co-founder of Oak Tre Capital the investment Guru Howard marks great to have you here now you are one of the world's most impressive and respected investors and also very famous for writing various kinds of memos um now we'd love to start off by just asking you what got you started in finance in the beginning</p>
</details>

我非常幸运，在纽约的公立学校读书，虽然学校拥挤且有所不同，但有一天，我的一个朋友说他们正在教一门会计课，我们应该去上。我选了这门课，然后就爱上了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know I was very fortunate and I went to the public schools in New York and uh schools were crowded and different ult but uh one day one of my uh buddies said they're teaching a course in accounting we should take it and I took it I loved it</p>
</details>

没多少人喜欢会计，真的不多，但你知道，它有一种对称性，某种思维方式会对此产生共鸣。所以我选了它，并爱上了它，然后我决定成为一名会计师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">not many people love accounting not too many uh but you know it has a it has a symmetry that that a certain kind of mind responds to so I took it and I loved it and uh you know that I decided to become an accountant</p>
</details>

主持人: 请问，那种特定的思维方式是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">excuse me what what is that certain kind of mind what is that</p>
</details>

我认为是非常左脑、逻辑、字面化、数学化的思维。但真正吸引我的是它的对称性，是借方和贷方之间的平衡。当我走在奥斯陆，看到那些非常对称的建筑时，我很享受。有些人可能会觉得它无聊，或者过于规整，但我对此反应非常强烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I I think very left brain logical literal mathematical um and but it's really the Symmetry it's the balance between the left and the right debit and credits when I look when I walk through Oso and I see the very symmetrical architecture I enjoy it some other people might think it's boring uh or too regular uh but uh you know I responded very strongly</p>
</details>

所以我就去了沃顿商学院（Wharton: 宾夕法尼亚大学的商学院）学习会计，后来接触到了金融，这当然更有趣，于是我转到了金融专业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I went off to Wharton uh to become an accountant and then I was introduced to finance which is actually of course much more interesting and switch to finance</p>
</details>

主持人: 这很有趣，因为大多数地方都说“Finance”，但您说“Finance”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's interesting because most places they say Finance but I Wen that they say Finance</p>
</details>

我想那是对的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think that's right yeah um</p>
</details>

### 霍华德·马克斯的投资哲学

主持人: 很好。那么，您的投资哲学是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very good now um what is your investment philosophy now what is it</p>
</details>

我的哲学，我想也是橡树资本的哲学，有六个非常简单的要点。第一是**风险控制**（Risk Control: 管理和减轻投资风险的策略）。我相信在市场中赚钱很容易，尤其是在好年份，而大多数年份都是好年份。真正的挑战和技能在于在控制风险的情况下赚钱，这样即使遇到糟糕的年份，你也不会表现得太差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My Philosophy is I guess it's Oak tre's philosophy six very simple points uh number one risk control I believe it's easy to make money in the market that's especially true in the good years and most years are good years uh the challenge uh the real skill is to make money with the risk under control so that if it turns out to be a bad year instead you won't do too badly</p>
</details>

第二是**一致性**。我的客户不希望结果大起大落，一年在顶部，下一年在底部。所以我们努力保持持续地略高于平均水平，但由于风险控制，在真正糟糕的年份，我们能跃居前列。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number two is consistency U my clients don't want results that are all over the lot and uh at the top one year and at the bottom the next uh so we try to be just consistently a little bit above the middle but then thanks to risk control in the really bad years we do bounce up to the top</p>
</details>

第三，我相信存在**市场效率**（Market Efficiency: 市场价格充分反映所有可用信息的程度），我们只针对效率较低的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number three I believe there's such a thing as market efficiency and we Target only the less efficient markets</p>
</details>

第四，高度专业化。在我看来，你不可能成为一个成功的通才。你必须在少数几件事上比其他人知道得更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number four high degree of specialization you can't be a successful generalist in my opinion you have to know more than everybody else about a few things</p>
</details>

第五，我们不依赖**宏观预测**（Macro Forecasting: 基于宏观经济指标对未来经济趋势的预测）来指导我们的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number five we don't rely on macro forecasting to drive our investments</p>
</details>

第六，我们不指望**市场时机**（Market Timing: 试图通过预测市场走势来买卖资产的行为）能带来多少收益。这就是我们的哲学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">and number six we don't uh expect much from Market timing so that's the philosophy</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，它随着时间改变了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right right there has he changed over time</p>
</details>

我五十年前就知道所有这些事情，但我认为我对它们的坚持变得更强了，我的信念也更坚定了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I knew all those things 50 years ago but I think my uh adherence to them has grown stronger my conviction</p>
</details>

主持人: 具体是哪些方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which ones in particular</p>
</details>

首先，我认为市场效率是一个非常重要的概念。我多年来的投资经验让我明白了原因，并让我认识到了解比别人更多信息的局限性。这也就引出了不进行市场时机选择的观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well first of all I think market efficiency is a very important concept um my experience as an investor over the years uh showed me why uh and introduced me to uh to the limits on on uh un knowing more than others uh and um that leads into uh non-market timing</p>
</details>

然后，我与预测者的经验基本上让我明白，宏观预测是行不通的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then my experience with forecasters basically in my opinion showed me that it doesn't work macro forecasting</p>
</details>

主持人: 所有的宏观经济学家都毫无用处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all the macroeconomists are useless</p>
</details>

您是这么说的，不不，我不是。我只是说他们不够持续正确，不值得追随。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well you said that no no there was a question I'm sorry I my ination was wrong I would say they're not right consistently enough to follow and uh you</p>
</details>

你知道，五十五年前我在银行工作时，我们常说经济学家就是那种从不标记市场（mark the market）的投资组合经理。我认为这是对的。如果你是一名积极的投资者，你不会在不查看某人记录的情况下雇佣他，但没有经济学家会展示他们的记录。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">know when I it at the bank 55 years ago we used to say that an economist is a portfolio manager who never marks the market and I think that's true uh you know uh if you were an active investor uh you wouldn't uh hire somebody without looking at their record but no Economist ever presents his record</p>
</details>

主持人: 他们不能，因为那样他们就不会被雇佣了。那么，这些规则中，哪些是最难坚持的？您从未被诱惑打破其中一些吗？您肯定有过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no they can't because they wouldn't be hired now which of these which of these rules um have been the most difficult to adhere to have you never been tempted to break some of them you must have been</p>
</details>

我从未被诱惑打破它们，因为我认为它们都强调了知识的局限性。我活得越久，就越理解知识的局限性，也就越坚信这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">I've never been tempted to break from them because I think I think that that what they all emphasize in my opinion is the limits on knowledge and the longer I live the more I understand the limits on knowledge the more convinced I am</p>
</details>

### 知识的局限性与随机性

主持人: 知识的局限性是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what what are the limits of knowledge</p>
</details>

首先，**随机性**（Randomness: 事件发生不可预测的特性）或运气无处不在。我们所从事的行业不像物理学或工程学那样遵循物理定律。在很大程度上，你是在与人打交道。市场是什么？它是人的集合。历史是如何形成的？通过人的行动。世界是如何被治理的？通过人的行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">number one Randomness or lock is every place in our business uh this is you're not dealing with physical laws like in physics or in engineering um you're dealing with in large part people I mean what are markets it's a collection of people uh how is history made through the actions of people and how do and the world is governed through the actions of people so uh you processes which are basically built around people can't be predicted</p>
</details>

物理学家理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）曾说，如果电子有感情，物理学就会困难得多。是的，人有感情，所以他们的行为是不可预测的，随机性扮演着非常重要的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh uh the the physicist Richard finans once said that uh physics would be much harder if electrons had feelings yeah people have feelings and so their behavior is unpredictable um and uh Randomness plays a very big part</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，您经常谈到如何判断一个决策的质量。请告诉我这方面的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you you often talk about that um how you judge the quality of a decision yes tell me about that</p>
</details>

嗯，由于随机性，一个好的决策并不总是有效，一个坏的决策也并不总是失败。六十一年前，我在沃顿商学院读的第一本书是《石油和天然气领域不确定性下的决策》（Decision Making Under Uncertainty in Oil and Gas）。我记得从那本书中学到的最重要的一课是，你不能从结果来判断一个决策的质量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well uh thanks to Randomness a good decision doesn't always work and a bad decision doesn't always fail m um the first book I read when I got to Wharton uh 61 years ago was uh decision making under uncertainty in oil and gas and the the greatest lesson I remember learning from that uh book is that you can't tell the quality of a decision from the outcome</p>
</details>

现在，很多人可能不理解这个概念。他们会说，当然可以。但如果你想想世界是多么随机，你就会知道在短期内，仅仅是随机性就能产生任何结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now this is a concept that many many people wouldn't get well of course you you can but if you think about how random the world is you know that in the short run Randomness alone can produce just about any outcome</p>
</details>

主持人: 那是因为有些愚蠢的人也会变富。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's because also some stupid people get rich</p>
</details>

没错。我们都知道有些人，我们会说“他因为错误的原因而做对了”。是的，有些愚蠢的人确实会变富。当然，我常说成功的要素包括进取心、时机和技能。如果你在正确的时间有足够的进取心，你就不需要太多技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well that's right we all know people we say oh he was he he was right for the wrong reason yeah and uh there are stupid people who get rich of course you know one of the things I say the ingredients in success are aggressiveness timing and skill and if you have enough aggressiveness at the right time you don't need much skill</p>
</details>

现在，这可以让你一两次做对，但要在整个职业生涯中反复做对，那才是在谈论技能。你不能依靠运气几十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh now that that can make you right once or twice but to be right repeatedly over an entire career now you're talking about skill you can't rely on on luck for for decades</p>
</details>

主持人: 年龄对投资过程有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what does age do to investment process</p>
</details>

我认为，在大多数情况下，年龄会让你变得更成熟。我认为，我希望随着时间的推移，你会更深入地理解事物。这是关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that for the for the most part age um Mellows you I think you I I hope in time you you over you understand things more deeply M that's the key um</p>
</details>

为什么我们年纪越大，或者临近死亡时，会更有耐心？嗯，希望那是因为我们学会了快速行动不是答案。希望我们培养了智慧，明白如果你想要一个好结果，花点时间思考问题会更有可能得到，而不是一时冲动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why are we more patient when we get older or just about to die well hopefully it's because we learn that quick action is not the answer we hopefully we we develop the wisdom to understand that uh if you want a good result you're more likely to get it if you take a little time to think about the question rather than act wh on a whim</p>
</details>

### 市场周期与均值回归

主持人: 您非常不看好经济预测，但您坚信周期，并相信了解我们所处的周期位置的重要性。为什么理解市场周期如此重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no you're very um dism I of economic forecasting as we as we talked about but you are a strong believer in cycles and knowing where we are in the cycle why why is the understanding of Market cycle so important</p>
</details>

世界是周期性的。你知道，每个人都知道市场、经济和政治都是周期性波动的。只要涉及人类行为，就没有什么是直线前进的。如果你指望它直线前进，你就会陷入大麻烦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well the world is cyclical uh and uh you know everybody knows that the market and the economy um and and uh politics um move cyclically and uh you know nothing moves in a straight line uh where human behavior is involved and if you were to count on it doing so you would uh get into big trouble</p>
</details>

我最近一直在考虑写一篇备忘录，人们一直在问我，您见过最大的错误是什么？或者人们最常犯的错误是什么？我认为就是一旦市场朝一个方向发展，人们就认为它会永远持续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've been thinking about writing a memo uh lately people have been asking me what is the biggest mistake that you've seen or what is the mistake that people make most often and I think it is that once the market is moving in One Direction that it will always continue to do so</p>
</details>

事实上，**均值回归**（Regression toward the mean: 极端表现最终会趋向平均水平的统计现象）或过度行为的修正，比持续直线运动要可靠得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in Truth uh regression toward the mean or the correction uh of uh excesses is much more dependable than continued moving in a straight line</p>
</details>

主持人: 为什么事物会回归？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why do things revert back</p>
</details>

我在2018年写了一本书，叫做《掌握市场周期》（Mastering the Market Cycle）。我非常相信周期，我是周期的学生，我与周期共存了很长时间。然而，当我写到这本书大约三分之二的时候，我问自己：为什么会有周期？经济每年增长2%，为什么它不能每年都只增长2%？为什么有时是1%，有时是3%，有时是负1%？答案是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because the I wrote a book uh in 2018 called the mastering the market cycle and uh I'm a great believer in Cycles I'm a student of Cycles I I I've lived with cycles for a long time and yet when I got about 2third of the way through writing the book I said to myself why do we have Cycles the economy grows at 2% a year why doesn't it just grow 2% every year why sometimes one and sometimes three and sometimes minus one some what so what's the answer</p>
</details>

答案是人们会走向极端。例如，如果经济连续几年增长良好，企业负责人就会说：“哦，我们必须建造新工厂，以获得我们行业增长中增加的份额。”于是他们就这么做了，但其他人也这么做了。现在工厂太多了，工厂利用率下降，公司陷入衰退。然后他们就会收缩，停止建造工厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the answer is that people go to excess and for example if the economy is growing well for a few years business uh heads say oh well we have to build a new Factory to get our increased share of the growth in our industry and so they do but so does everybody else now there are too many factories and now uh the uh Factory utilization Falls and the companies go into decline so then they pull back and they and they stop building factories</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，直截了当的贪婪和恐惧呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so straightforward greet and fair</p>
</details>

贪婪和恐惧是一个很好的说法。你知道，你提到了那些备忘录，我写于1991年的第二篇备忘录叫做《钟摆》（The Pendulum），讲的就是贪婪与恐惧、乐观与悲观、轻信与怀疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">greed and fear is is a good way to put it and you know uh you mentioned the the memos the second memo I wrote uh 1991 was called the pendulum greed and fear optimism and pessimism credulousness and skepticism</p>
</details>

### 预测与周期：看似矛盾的统一

主持人: 您不看好预测，但又非常相信，或者说试图弄清楚我们所处的周期位置。这听起来有点反直觉，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you dismiss forecasting yet you are a great believer in no or trying to figure out where we are in the cycle isn't that kind of counterintuitive it sounds it on the face</p>
</details>

表面上听起来是这样，但我认为在某些时候，预测会变得更有用，那就是当我们处于极端情况时。现在，如果你想想我刚才说的，人们犯的最大错误是相信一个一旦开始运行的过程会永远不停地持续下去，这就是导致市场达到极端高点（我们称之为**泡沫**（Bubbles: 资产价格远超其内在价值的非理性上涨））和低点（我们称之为**崩盘**（Crashes: 市场价格迅速大幅下跌））的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think there is a time when when forecasting becomes more useful and that is when we're at an extreme uh now if think about what I said a minute ago that the biggest mistake people make is to believe that a process once in operation will continue non-stop forever that's what takes markets to extreme highs which we call Bubbles and lows which we call crashes</p>
</details>

但是，当市场极度高涨，人们兴奋地说“这会永远持续下去”时，它通常最终会因自身重量而崩溃。所以，当市场极度高或极度低时，我认为我们可以做出有利可图的预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but when we're extremely high and people get excited and say hey this is going to go on for ever usually it will collapse eventually of its own weight so when the market is crazy high or crazy low I think we can uh make a profitable uh forecast</p>
</details>

唯一的问题是，我们没有太多这样的机会。我在写那本关于周期的书时，曾和我的儿子谈过，我说：“你知道，我认为我的市场预测一直都挺准的。”他说：“是的，爸爸，那是因为你五十年里只做了五次。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the only thing is uh ncai that we don't get too many opportunities uh I was speaking with my son when I was writing that book on cycles and I said you know I think my market forecasts have been about right he says yes Dad that's cuz you did did it five times in 50 years</p>
</details>

市场有五次达到了如此极端的程度，以至于均值回归是可靠的，不是指它何时发生、什么导致它发生或发生的速度，而是指它会发生这个事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">five times the market has been at such an extreme that regression toward the mean has been dependable not in terms of when it will happen or what will cause it or how fast it'll happen but the fact that it will</p>
</details>

我们现在处于什么位置？我认为我们处于中间地带。我认为我们略高于公允价值，但还没有高到可以预测或确定会下跌的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where are we now I think we're in the middle ground I think we're a little bit above uh fair value but not so high that a decline is uh predictable or Dependable</p>
</details>

主持人: 您现在是在谈论信贷周期吗，还是？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know are you are you talking about credit cycle now or talking no</p>
</details>

不，我现在主要谈论的是股市。我没有直接参与股市。你知道，橡树资本的大部分活动都在信贷市场。但股市是一个很好的晴雨表，因为它非常明显。我们每天都能得到股市的读数，但在信贷市场我们不能频繁得到读数，在私人信贷领域我们根本得不到读数，一切都在幕后进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm talking right now about about the stock market right pretty much and I'm not I'm not involved in the stock market directly uh you know most of Oak tre's activities are in the credit markets yeah but it's a I think the stock market is a good barometer because it's very it's very obvious uh we get a reading in the stock market every day we don't get frequent readings in the credit market and in private credit we never get readings it all takes place behind closed doors</p>
</details>

所以我把股市，特别是美国的**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数），看作是心理状况的一个非常好的指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I take the stock market and particularly the S&P 500 stock index in the US as a very good indicator of what's going on in Psychology</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为我们还有多少个好年头？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how many more good years do you think we have</p>
</details>

嗯，你看，现在您已经越界进入预测领域了，而且不仅仅是预测，您还要求我预测时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well see now now you've crossed the line into we going into prediction now into well but not only that but you've crossed the line into ask me to to make a prediction as to time</p>
</details>

我的一位橡树资本的同事在他的季度致客户信中曾说过一条规则：如果你说一个价格，就不要说一个日期；如果你说一个日期，就不要说一个价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right one of my oak tree colleagues in his quarterly letter to his clients stated his rule if you name a price don't name a date if you name a date don't name a price yeah</p>
</details>

主持人: 这样你就永远不会错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then you can never be wrong yeah</p>
</details>

你知道，这里有一个重要的事情需要思考，我认为很多人没有这样做。假设你我都能同意，标普500指数今天被高估了20%，我认为这可能是一个很好的估计。**市盈率**（PE Ratio: 衡量公司股价相对于每股收益的指标）是21，战后常态是16，所以被高估了20%到25%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know the mar here's the important thing to think about which I don't think many people do let's just say that you and I can agree that the S&P is 20% overvalued today which I think is probably a good estimate the PE Ratio is 21 the post-war Norm is 16 so 20 25% overvalued</p>
</details>

假设我们同意这一点，并且我们是对的。下一个问题是，它在明年下跌的可能性有多大？这可能性不大，可能略高于50/50，但不是100%或90%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and let's say let's say we agree on that and let's say we're right the next question is what is the probability that it's going to decline in the next year it's modest it's probably a little better than 50/50 but it's not 100 or 90</p>
</details>

如果你和我一样活了这么久，我们都见过被高估的市场变得更高估，然后变得更更高估，然后进入真正的泡沫。如果每次市场被高估时都会修正，那么就不会有泡沫了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh if you've lived as long as you and I have we've seen markets that were overpriced become more overpriced yeah and then more overpriced and then get into a genuine bubble uh if it was true that every time the Market's overvalued it corrects then you wouldn't get bubbles</p>
</details>

<p class="english-text">yeah that's an important principle in your firm right right</p>

### 健全的风险管理

这把我们带到了风险管理。您说您的目标是在控制风险的情况下提供卓越的投资回报。那么，对您来说，健全的风险管理是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which brings us on to uh risk management what you say is that um your goal is to deliver Superior investment results with risk and under control now to you what is sound risk management</p>
</details>

健全的风险管理，首先重要的是，它不是**风险规避**（Risk Avoidance: 完全避免风险的行为）。风险规避通常会导致回报规避。如果你想获得好的回报，就必须承担风险。我上周就这个主题发表了一篇备忘录，我说，如果你想赚钱，就必须承担风险，但你不应该期望仅仅因为承担风险就能赚钱，你必须巧妙地去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">sound risk management first of all importantly is not risk avoidance risk avoidance usually results in return avoidance yeah um if you want to make a good return you have to take risk I put out a memo last week on the subject and I said uh you know if you want to make money uh you have to take risk but you should not expect to make money just for taking risk you have to do it skillfully</p>
</details>

所以有一个过程我称之为“为利润而智能承担风险”。我们努力参与其中。它必须是你意识到的风险，你可以分析的风险，你可以分散的风险，以及你为此获得高额报酬的风险。如果这四个必要条件都满足，那么承担风险是值得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so there is a process that I call uh the intelligent bearing of risk for profit we try to engage in that it has to be risk you're aware of risk you can analyze risk you can diversify and risk you're highly paid to take if if those four necessities are uh satisfied then it it pays to take risk</p>
</details>

主持人: 当您谈到**概率结果**（Probabilistic outcomes: 基于概率理论可能出现的多种结果）时，您指的是什么？因为我们不是在处理物理科学，因为我们不是在处理物理学，所以总会有各种各样的结果。未来从来都不是如此确定，以至于只有一件事会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you talk about um probabilistic go comes what do you mean by that because we're not dealing with the physical sciences because we're not dealing with physics uh there can always be a variety of outcomes we we the future is never so certain that only one thing can happen</p>
</details>

事实上，伦敦商学院（London Business School）有一位名叫埃尔罗伊·迪姆森（Elroy Dimson）的教授，他说：“风险意味着可能发生的事情比实际发生的事情要多。”这是一个非常简单的陈述，但非常真实。所以你必须认识到，在任何情况下，都有多种结果是可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in fact there was a professor at the London Business School named Elroy Dimson and he said risk means more things can happen than will happen it's a very simple statement but it's very true and so you have to you have to uh appreciate the fact that under any set of circumstances a variety of outcomes are possible</p>
</details>

而且，你应该总是考虑到未来的变幻莫测。美国伟大的幽默家马克·吐温（Mark Twain）曾说：“让你陷入困境的不是你不知道的事情，而是你确信无疑但实际上并非如此的事情。”换句话说，过度确定性是敌人，承认自己的局限性是你的朋友，它能让你避免麻烦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um you should always allow for the vagaries of the future uh Mark Twain the Great American humorist once said it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble it's what you know for certain that just ain't true in other words excessive certainty is the enemy acknowledging your limitations is your friend it keeps you from getting into trouble</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为现在有什么普遍的看法可能是错误的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is the common wisdom now which you think may be wrong</p>
</details>

在去年12月，我认为可能错误的是，当时普遍认为美联储（Federal Reserve）今年将降息六次。我当时说，我认为这过于乐观了。我将其描述为**金发姑娘思维**（Goldilocks thinking: 认为一切都“刚刚好”，不会太热也不会太冷，过于乐观的思考方式）。还记得金发姑娘吗？不太热，不太冷，一切都刚刚好，一切都会永远保持良好。这种思维方式很危险，因为它假设了一个乐观的未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh in December what I thought might be wrong well you saw you know in December there was a high Dee degree of consensus that the FED would cut rat six times this year yeah and I said I thought that was excessively optimistic I described it as goldilock thinking remember Goldilocks not too hot not too cold yeah everything's it's just right everything's going to stay good forever that kind of thinking is dangerous because it it uh it it assumes an optimistic future</p>
</details>

我认为那太乐观了。现在大多数人说今年会降息两到三次，所以那个错误我认为已经被纠正了。

<details>

主持人: 恕我插一句，您是否惊讶于市场对这种相当大的预期调整没有更负面的反应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um um one of the reasons I think that that that you can't predict the direction of the stock market in the short term excuse me just one one thing are you surprised that the market hasn't reacted more negatively on that pretty big adjustment in expectations</p>
</details>

是的，我有点惊讶。但这有点像微积分中的二阶导数。我认为市场仍然由乐观主义者主导，只是他们不那么乐观了，但乐观主义者仍在发挥影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes I am I am a little bit surprised um but it's kind of like calculus and the second uh derivative you know I think that I think that the market is still governed by optimists just they're they're a little less optimistic but The Optimist is still holding sway</p>
</details>

但如果你看看标普500指数，它在过去六周内趋于平稳，没有下跌，但也停止了上涨。所以我确实认为乐观情绪的水平有所下降。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um but if you look at the if you look at the S&P it's kind of flattened out in the last 6 weeks and it hasn't gone down but it also stopped going up um so I do think that that the the level of optimism is is down</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，橡树资本是如何处理风险的呢？是独立的风险管理人员，还是……你们是如何构建这个过程的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how do you work with risk at Oak Tre separate risk people or just um how do you structure the process</p>
</details>

不，不，我一直抵制设立风险管理部门。我认为控制风险是每个人的工作。倡导某项投资并研究它的人，不仅应该考虑回报，还应该考虑风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no no uh I've always uh resisted having um a risk Management Department I think it's everybody's job to control risk and the the person who advocates for a given investment and studies it should be the person who not only thinks about the return but also the risk</p>
</details>

那种“我是投资者，我的工作是赚钱，我只考虑上涨空间，有个人坐在角落里，他的工作是考虑风险”的概念，我认为这会让你陷入危险境地。因为每个人都会说：“嗯，我可以指望别人来限制风险。”我认为这不是一个好主意。我认为风险控制是每个人的责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and uh you know the the the the concept that I am the investor my job is to make money I think about the upside there's somebody who who sits over there in the corner his job is to think about the risk I think that gets you into D dangerous territory uh because uh everybody says well I can count on somebody else to limit the risk I think that's I think that's not a good idea I think that that risk control is everybody's responsibility</p>
</details>

事实上，我之前列出了我们的投资哲学，风险控制是第一位的。顺便说一句，橡树资本和我的同事最初是做纯粹的**固定收益投资**（Fixed Income Investing: 投资于债券等提供固定回报的证券）的。当你购买债券时，你购买的是8%的债券，从长远来看，你最好的情况就是8%。没有上涨空间，只有下跌空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and in fact uh I I listed our investment philosophy before risk control is number one I want and and by the way oak tree and I and my colleague started off doing straight fixed income when you when you buy bonds you buy an 8% bond in the long run the best you can do is 8% yeah there's no upside there's only downside</p>
</details>

所以，一个合格的固定收益投资者必须考虑并避免下行风险，而不必担心上行空间。本杰明·格雷厄姆（Benjamin Graham）和戴维·多德（David Dodd）在《证券分析》（Security Analysis）这本投资圣经中说，固定收益投资是一门负面艺术，其艺术在于避免下行风险，而不是获取上行空间。固定收益投资除了承诺的回报之外，没有上行空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so uh so the the proper fixed income investor uh has to think about and avoid the downside doesn't have to worry about the upside a Graham and DOD in the Bible of security analysis well the title of the book is security analysis Ben Graham was Warren Buffett teacher they said in that book that fixed income investing is a negative art that the art is in avoiding the downside not in capturing the upside there is no upside in fixed income investing Beyond The Promised return</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，当债券出现负利率时，您当时是怎么想的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when bonds had negative rates what did you think then</p>
</details>

我认为那是不可持续的。我的意思是，负利率不是市场现象，而是由中央银行管理的。当然，在短期内，中央银行可以随心所欲。美国有句老话：“不要与美联储（FED）作对。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought it was unsustainable uh I mean uh but negative rates were not a market phenomenon they were uh administered by the central banks yeah uh and of course in the short run uh the central banks can do what they want there's an old saying in America don't fight the FED</p>
</details>

你知道，如果你想想，在12月，我提到共识是会有六次降息，而**点阵图**（Dot Plot: 美联储官员对未来利率路径预测的图表），也就是美联储高管意见的表达，说会有三次。那么，市场参与者说会有六次降息，而美联储自己却说会有三次，这有什么意义呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know and and by the way if you think about it uh in December I mentioned that the consensus was that there would be six rate cuts the Dot Plot which is the expression of the FED Executives opinions said there would be three m now what sense does it make for Market participants to say there will be six Cuts If the Fed itself is saying there will be three</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，您是如何解读的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think that so how did you read that</p>
</details>

我认为那是一个错误，我认为那是一种过度乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think that was I think that was a mistake yeah I think that was that was an excessive optimism</p>
</details>

但是，你知道，因为在我看来，风险控制是首要任务，因为我们最初是纯粹的固定收益投资者，所以我们为橡树资本提出了座右铭：“如果我们避免了亏损者，赢家就会自己照顾自己。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but but you know because uh risk control is job one in my opinion because we started off as straight fixed income investors we came up with the motto for oak tree if we avoid the losers the winners take care of themselves yeah yeah</p>
</details>

这在最初的十年多时间里效果很好。之后，我们开始进入我称之为“抱负型策略”的领域，我们试图赚取不是8%而是15%或20%的回报。在这种情况下，仅仅避免亏损者是不够的，你必须真正找到一些赢家。但我们一直将风险控制作为投资哲学的首要原则，因为我们确实认为它极其重要。我希望每个分析师和投资组合经理都思考风险，而不是指望风险部门的人来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now that that was good for the first 10 plus years after that we started getting into what I call aspirational strategies where we're trying to make not 8% but 15 or 20 avoiding the losers is not enough in that case you have to actually find some winners but we have kept risk control as tenant number number one of the investment philosophy because we do think it's extremely important and I want every uh analyst and portfolio manager be to be thinking about risk and not counting on the person in the risk Department to do so</p>

### 从博弈中学习投资智慧

主持人: 您经常谈论各种类型的游戏，比如纸牌游戏、扑克、桥牌、双陆棋，您会比较它们，并谈论您如何教您的儿子玩，这很有趣。您从这个领域中学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you often talk about various types of games yes uh C games uh poker bridge backham and and you compare them and uh talk about how you taught your son to play and was so much fun right what kind of learnings have you drawn from this field</p>
</details>

纸牌游戏、双陆棋、国际象棋都对投资非常有帮助，我认识的许多投资者都玩其中一种或多种。首先，它们都是风险承担。你投入资金，希望最终能赚更多，但你也可能输掉本金，所以它让你习惯了承担风险的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">card games back Gam chess are all very helpful for investing and many many of the investors I know play one or more of them um it first of all it's risk-taking you put up money in the hope that you'll end up with more but you could lose your stake so it gets you used to the concept of risk taking</p>
</details>

其次，它们都是概率性的。你几乎没有什么事情是总能奏效的，部分原因是因为运气，部分原因是因为你是在与一个有技巧的对手对抗。所以，评估概率非常非常重要，构建你的赌注，知道你何时有优势，何时没有优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">secondly it's all probabilistic uh you there's almost nothing you can do that will always work in in part because luck is involved and in part because you're playing against an opponent who is skillful so uh assessing probabilities is very very important uh structuring your bet knowing when you have an advantage knowing when you have don't have an advantage</p>
</details>

主持人: 您把金融市场看作一场游戏吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you look at financial markets as as a game</p>
</details>

嗯，不是那种“哈哈”的游戏，而是一种赌博。我不是贬义地使用“赌博”这个词。但我们为客户做的工作是把他们委托给我们的钱，努力让它变得更多。很少有无风险的方法可以做到这一点，而无风险的方法回报也不高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well not as a game as in haha but as as a as a gamble uh I don't use the word gamble negatively but our job for our clients is to take the money they've entrusted to us and try to turn it into more uh and uh there are very way few ways to do that riskless and the riskless ways don't have much reward</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，自从1978年花旗银行（Citibank）要求我调到债券部门，开始管理**可转换债券**（Convertible Bonds: 可转换为发行公司股票的债券）和**高收益债券**（High Yield Bonds: 风险较高但收益也较高的债券，通常指垃圾债券）的投资组合以来，我就一直涉足那些被认为是高风险的市场利基。从来没有像高等级债券或标普股票那样舒适的投资。这些都是真正的风险市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you know ever since 1978 when City Bank asked me to move into the bond department and start up portfolios in convertible bonds on highi bonds I have been involved in in Market niches that are considered risky never anything as comfortable as highgrade bonds or uh S&P stocks uh these are real risk markets</p>
</details>

所以我不得不发展出我所说的“为利润而智能承担风险”的方法，并以一致的方式实施它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh so I've had to develop uh what I call the intelligent bearing of risk for profit and implement it in a consistent way</p>
</details>

主持人: 另一个和您一样热爱游戏的人是安妮·杜克（Annie Duke）。我认为她的作品很棒，但您为什么喜欢她的作品？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now another person who shares your love for games is Annie Duke I think her work is great but why do you why do you like her work</p>
</details>

安妮·杜克，为了听众的利益，她曾一度是世界上最好的女子扑克玩家。她曾是世界冠军，不仅仅是女子冠军，而是所有人的世界冠军。大多数人不知道，她完成了决策分析博士学位的所有课程，现在她已经获得了学位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well Annie Duke for the benefit of your listeners was uh at one point in time the best woman poker player in the world she was world champion not just for the women but for everybody in the world uh she most people don't know it but she uh well when I first met her five years ago she had completed all the coursework for a PhD in in decision analysis and now she has earned her degree um</p>
</details>

所以她以专业、分析和纪律的方式对待扑克，这也是我为客户所做的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so she approaches poker professionally analytically um and with discipline and that's what my job is to do for my clients</p>
</details>

她写了一本书，2019年出版，叫做《思考的赌注》（Thinking in Bets）。首先，我非常喜欢这个标题，我们可以把我们的分析过程简化为构建赌注。我当时遇到了她，印象非常深刻。我在2020年1月疫情前发表的最后一篇备忘录，标题就是《你打赌》（You Bet），它实际上就是关于安妮和她的方法。然后我与她做了一个播客，很多人告诉我他们很喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">your job for for your clients uh here at at the bank um and she wrote a book in 9 in 2019 called thinking in bets first of all I just love the title that we can reduce our um our uh analytical process to structuring things as bets and and uh I uh met her at that time was really impressive I the last memo I published before the pandemic in January of 2020 uh was entitled you bet it was really about Annie and and her approach and um and then I did a podcast with her that a lot of people have told me that they enjoyed</p>
</details>

我认为思考构建赌注的过程非常有帮助，而大多数人并不真正理解它。他们认为，例如，在一场篮球比赛中，湖人队对阵尼克斯队，通常大家对哪支球队更好，哪支球队更被看好有广泛共识。但如果你押注弱队，你会得到赔率。如果你押一美元，他们赢了，你会得到两三美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and um I think it helps a great deal to think about the process of structuring bets um and most people people don't really understand it they think that well for example in let's say there's a uh uh basketball game and the Lakers are playing the Knicks there's usually very broad agreement uh which team is better which team is favored in that game but if you bet on the underdog you get odds you bet a if you bet a dollar and they win you get two or three</p>
</details>

所以现在问题变了，不是哪个结果更有可能发生，而是投资于可能获胜的球队，回报是否更好？有时投资于可能输掉的球队，回报反而更好。即使他们成功的可能性很小，但由于你获得了足够的赔率，这种不可能性也被克服了。市场也是这样运作的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so now the question changes it's not what outcome is likely to happen but it's is the payoff better for investing in the team that will probably win sometimes the payoff is better for investing in the team that will probably lose and even the improbability of their success is overcome by the fact that you're offered sufficient op this is the way the markets work too absolutely</p>
</details>

### 逆向投资的本质与挑战

主持人: 这就引出了整个**逆向投资**（Contrarian Investing: 采取与市场主流观点相反的投资策略）领域。那么，在金融领域，逆向投资有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which brings us to the whole contrarian investing field so how important is it to be contrarian in finance</p>
</details>

我认为这是必不可少的。逆向投资仅仅意味着与共识作对。在每个主题上都有一个共识，有大多数人认为的情况。当共识过于强烈，并且人们对共识结果的乐观情绪过高时，押注不太可能发生的结果的赔率可能会非常高，以至于成为一个引人注目的赌注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think it's it's essential uh contrarianism merely means uh betting against the consensus yeah in every on every subject there's a consensus there's what most people believe is is the case um when the consensus is too strong and there's too much optimism that the consensus outcome will uh uh apply maybe the odds for betting on the improbable outcome are so high that it's a compelling bet</p>
</details>

如果你把共识带入投资市场，那么共识知识已经体现在每项资产的价格中。也许你能找到一些时候，你认为共识是错误的，通过与共识作对，你可以做得更好。通常是因为做那些被认为不太可能的事情，回报会非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um the consensus if you take that into the investment markets the uh the knowledge consensus is already embodied in the price of every asset maybe you can find times when you think the consensus is wrong and uh you can do better by betting against it um usually because the payoff is so high for doing the thing that is considered unlikely</p>
</details>

现在我想强调的是，我并不认为常规性地说“共识是什么？我们反着来”是个好主意。这个过程必须更深入。你必须说：“共识是什么？我怎么看？共识的思维有什么问题？他们为什么那样想？什么能揭示他们的错误？”所以这是一个非常深刻的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I want to stress that I don't think it's a good idea to routinely say well what does the consensus think let's do the opposite the process has to be much uh deeper than that you have to say what does the consensus think what do I think what's wrong with the consensus thinking why did they think that way what could make the error of their ways exposed so it's it's it's a very deep question</p>

但你通常不会通过押注人人喜爱的东西来赚大钱。大钱是通过押注人们讨厌的东西来赚取的，因为这些东西因此而便宜。

你必须是一个独来独往的人。我在2015年写了一篇名为《敢于卓越II》（Dare to Be Great II）的备忘录，我当时说，如果你想成为一名杰出的投资者，首先，你必须敢于与众不同。你的投资组合必须与众不同，否则你无法脱颖而出。

</details>

其次，你必须敢于犯错，因为你必须承担这些不受欢迎的头寸。第三，你必须敢于看起来是错的，因为即使你是对的，在一段时间内可能也不会很明显，在这段时间里，你可能会看起来是错的，格格不入，受到批评，感到不足。你必须能够忍受这些。

<p class="english-text">uh were you a loner when you were young</p>
</details>

我想是的。而且我相信大脑的力量。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I guess so yeah and I I and I believe in the power of the brain uh you see</p>
</details>

但第二点是，我有一个搭档叫布鲁斯·卡什（Bruce Karsh），他得到的关注比我少，他喜欢这样。但他从87年开始就是我的搭档。当我们做这些周期性困难的事情时，比如在雷曼兄弟（Lehman Brothers）破产后的15周里，我们每周平均购买6.5亿美元，持续15周，总计100亿美元。我们互相支持。

<p class="english-text">uh but number two I have a partner named Bruce K who gets less attention than I do uh popularly he likes it that way but uh he's been my partner since ' 87 and when we do these things which are cyclically difficult that is like for example we we were very steady buyers in the 15 weeks following the bankruptcy of Leman Brothers 650 million a week on average for 15 weeks that's $10 billion we support each other</p>
</details>

单独做会很困难的事情，当你有一个你尊敬并支持你的人时，就会变得更容易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and uh things that would be difficult individually become easier when you have somebody you respect who who supports you</p>
</details>

主持人: 我认为这是一个非常好的观点。很多优秀的基金经理都是这样工作的。但是，当您有更多经验并被证明正确过几次之后，做这些事情会更容易吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's a very very good point a lot of fantastic fund managers are uh you know work in in Paris right um but is it easier to do this when you have more experience and have been proven right a few times</p>
</details>

我认为是这样，尼古拉。一方面，你可以推断出你认为正确的答案，但我认为，正如你所说，过去被证明正确会有帮助，你会对自己的过程产生一定的尊重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's right uh Nikolai you have to um I mean on the one hand you can reason out what you think is the right answer but uh I think that it helps to as you say have been proved right in the past and you gain a certain respect for your process</p>
</details>

而且，我们成功地做这些行为，是在世界走向一个极端而我们采取逆向思维的时候。当你做了几次之后，它就有点像肌肉记忆了。你就会产生一种感觉：“哦，是的，我想我在我的《周期》那本书里说过，你只会对自己说，‘哦，是的，这是其中之一。’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah um and U and also the other thing is that these kinds of behaviors which we we've done successfully on balance have been done when the world went to one extreme and we were contrarian and after you do it a few times you kind of it's kind of like muscle memory yeah and you kind of develop a feeling oh yes uh I think I said in my book on Cycles you just say to yourself oh yeah this is one of those yeah</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为当市场真正泡沫化、看涨时，还是当市场充满恐惧时，更容易采取逆向投资？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think it's easier to be contrarian when markets are really frothy and uh bullish or when they are fearful</p>
</details>

这是一个很好的问题。我认为当市场泡沫化时更容易，但泡沫很难衡量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a great question um I think it's easier when the markets are frothy because but froth is difficult to measure right</p>
</details>

嗯，确实如此。你知道，我使用某种晴雨表，不是有形的东西，但我花了很多时间试图“测量市场温度”，感受其他人是在极度乐观还是极度悲观地操作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well it is but and and uh you know I I use a certain uh barometer nothing uh tangible but I you know I spend a lot of time trying what I call take the temperature of the market and get a sense for whether other people are operating out of extreme optimism or extreme pessimism</p>
</details>

主持人: 您是如何做到的？晴雨表是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you do it what do a bar look like</p>
</details>

我只是看人们表达了什么样的观点，这些观点有多么一致，有多么强烈，持有这些观点的人有多么自满。你知道，当你进入一个像2000年互联网泡沫那样的泡沫时，那些持有这些观点并赚最多钱的人，他们的理由是最愚蠢的。他们的理由根本站不住脚。所以希望你能看穿这一点，并在他们冲下悬崖之前下车。

<details>

<p class="english-text">uh I just look at what opinions are being expressed how uniformly are they held how strongly are they held how self-satisfied are the people who are holding them uh you know and you get into for example a bubble like the the uh internet bubble uh of 2000 and uh you know the people who are holding those opinions and making the most money are doing it for the silliest of reasons their justifications just don't hold and so hopefully you can see through that and and get off the train uh before they ride it off the off the cliff</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，霍华德·马克斯的晴雨表现在如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the how it marks uh barometer just now</p>
</details>

温和。我的意思是，事实上，我最近在一篇备忘录中写道，人们说他们现在感到前所未有的不确定。在我看来，这是健康的。你应该感到不确定。当你确定的时候，那才是危险的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well moderate um I mean in fact uh I I wrote in one of my memos recently that um people say that they this is they're the most uncertain they've ever been in my book that's healthy you should be uncertain when you're certain that's dangerous uh and</p>
</details>

嗯，这又回到了马克·吐温关于你不知道但你确信无疑但实际上并非如此的引言。我在2022年10月写了一篇备忘录，名为《知识的幻觉》（The Illusion of Knowledge）。一位伟大的历史学家丹尼尔·布尔斯廷（Daniel Boorstin）说：“知识的敌人不是无知，而是知识的幻觉。”是那种错误的信念，认为你已经知道了，这会阻止你继续探究。

<p class="english-text">uh um well it goes back to Twain's quote about what you don't know but uh but you you know it for certain and it's not true um I wrote a book a memo in the October of uh 22 uh called the illusion of knowledge there's a great historian called Daniel boron he says the enemy of knowledge is not ignorance it's the illusion of knowledge it's the fallacious belief that you know which stops you from inquiring</p>
</details>

所以我认为，承认你不知道某些事情是非常健康的。

### 信息来源与年轻投资者的建议

主持人: 您的信息来源是什么？您读些什么？您的信息流是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is your source of information what do you what do you read what are your um what's the information flow</p>
</details>

主要是报纸。我每天尝试阅读两三份报纸，再加上《经济学人》（The Economist）。对我来说，最重要的不是拥有数据，每个人都有数据，每个人都知道今天世界上发生了什么，昨天发生了什么。对我来说，最重要的事是坐下来思考“这意味着什么？”弄清楚正在发生的事情的重要性，以及其影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mostly the newspapers I try to uh consume two or three newspapers a day plus The Economist um uh I say magazine they call it a newspaper um to me the most important thing is not to have the data everybody has the data everybody knows what's happening in the world today and what happened yesterday to me the most important thing is to sit and say what does it mean figure out the import of the things that are happening uh the implications</p>
</details>

我与其他数据驱动型的人相比，并不是高度数据驱动的，而是被“弄清楚我们所处的周期位置”这个想法所驱动，测量市场的温度。我在2023年7月左右发表了一篇备忘录，名为《测量温度》（Taking the Temperature），我说，正如我与安德鲁的对话中提到的，在我的职业生涯中有五次我采取了逆向的市场立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and uh I am not highly data driven compared to other people but rather um driven by this idea of figuring out where we stand in the cycle taking the temperature of the market uh I put out a a memo in the roughly July of 23 called taking the temperature and I say that there were as as as I mentioned with my conversation with Andrew there were five times in my career that I took U contrarian stands on the Market</p>
</details>

它们本质上不是数据驱动的。例如，我非常担心导致全球金融危机的情况。那是由房地产泡沫，特别是次级抵押贷款和抵押贷款支持证券引起的。我当时对次级抵押贷款一无所知，我不知道它存在。我对抵押贷款支持证券也不太了解。我只知道市场行为漫不经心，没有风险意识，这对我来说是最危险的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">they were essentially not data driven for example I was very concerned about uh the uh conditions heading into what turned out to be the global financial crisis now it was caused by the housing bubble and especially the subprime mortgages and mortgage back Securities I had no idea about subprime I didn't know it existed I didn't know much about mortgage back Securities I only knew that the markets were acting in a Carefree nonrisk conscious manner which to me is the most dangerous thing</p>
</details>

主持人: 您和谁交流？您向谁寻求建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so who do you speak to who do you advice</p>
</details>

我努力广泛地获取知识。当然，没有特别的个人。我以前总是努力了解查理·芒格（Charlie Munger）在想什么，我努力跟上沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）的步伐，但他话不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I try to um glean knowledge broadly um there are really no particular individuals of course I always like to uh I used to know uh try very hard to know what Charlie Munger was thinking and uh I try to keep up with Warren Buffett but he doesn't say much um um</p>
</details>

斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒（Stan Druckenmiller），你可以让他发言，但他是一个交易员，所以他的观点在短期内会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stan druck and Miller uh he you can get you can get Stan at talk but he's a traitor so his his opinion changes in the short term yeah um</p>
</details>

塞斯·卡拉曼（Seth Klarman）是一位非常聪明的波士顿基金经理。我只是努力批判性地观察我周围发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there Seth claran is a very uh intelligent money manager in Boston um and uh I I just try to um I would call myself an observer uh and uh I just try to U critically observe what's going on around me</p>
</details>

主持人: 霍华德，假设现在是2025年，您正在学习商业，并且想规划一个金融领域的人生。您会怎么做？您对对这个领域感兴趣的年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now Howard you are um let's say now you are 2025 you are um studying business and you want to plan a life in in finance how do you go about this what is your advice to young people who are interested in this field</p>
</details>

我最重要的建议是：由于金融世界中随机性的普遍存在，如果你必须每次都做对，你就无法令人满意地成为一名投资者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my most important advice is this due to the prevalence of Randomness in the financial world you can't be an investor satisfactorily if you have to be right all the time</p>
</details>

纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布（Nassim Nicholas Taleb）的《被随机性愚弄》（Fooled by Randomness）一书将投资与牙科作对比。他说，如果你去牙科学校，学会了补牙，并且每次都那样补，你就会每次都成功。但在投资中，你做任何事情都无法保证每次都成功。如果你有60%或70%的时间是正确的，你就会是世界上最聪明的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh there's a book called Fooled by Randomness by Nasim Nicholas TB and he contrasts investing against Dentistry he says if you if you go to dental school and you learn to fill a cavity and you fill it that way every time you'll be successful every time there's nothing you can do in investing that will make you successful every time if you if you're right 60% or 70% of the time you you'll be the smartest man in the world</p>
</details>

所以，如果你是那种必须每次都做对的人，就不要成为投资者。不，但投资是一个巨大的谜题，有许多许多需要像剥洋葱一样层层考虑的因素。如果你喜欢解决智力谜题，并且能够承受起伏和犯错的变幻莫测，我认为这是一个很棒的领域。但你必须在哲学上武装自己才能做到这一点，然后你必须有一个学徒期，向懂得如何做的人学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I if you're the kind of person who has to be right all the time don't become an investor no but investing is a great puzzle with many many considerations that have to be peeled like an onion and if you like responding to an intellectual puzzle and you can stand the ups and downs and the vagaries of being wrong I think it's a great area but you have to equip yourself philosophically to do it and then you have to have an apprenticeship in which you learn from somebody else who knows how to do it</p>
</details>

您比大多数人更好地解决了这个谜题。非常感谢您和我们在一起，祝您未来一切顺利。
