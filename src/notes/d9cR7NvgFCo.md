### 开场与国际象棋的商业启示

大家好，欢迎收听“In Good Company”播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi everybody and welcome to in good company.</p>
</details>

今天，我们非常荣幸地邀请到一位几乎无需介绍的嘉宾——国际象棋史上评分最高的棋手马格努斯·卡尔森。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">today we are incredibly honored to have a guest who needs very little introduction, Magnus Carlson, the highest rated chess player in history.</p>
</details>

今天我们将讨论商业，或者更确切地说，我们将探讨作为投资者，我们可以从国际象棋和马格努斯身上学到些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and today we're going to talk about business or actually we're going to talk a bit about what we as investors can learn from chess and from humongus.</p>
</details>

非常欢迎你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very welcome.</p>
</details>

谢谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thank you very much.</p>
</details>

在第二次世界大战期间，英国几乎所有的国际象棋专家都被招募到**Ultra项目**（Ultra Project: 二战期间英国破解纳粹密码的秘密行动）中，该项目主要负责破解纳粹使用的密码。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now um during um the second world war in uh Britain uh pretty much every chess expert were recruited to the ultra project which was basically cracking cods used by the Nazis.</p>
</details>

因此，人们一直认为，杰出的国际象棋高手在任何事情上都表现出色，我只是想知道，你认为我们商界人士能从国际象棋中学到什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so there's been this assumption that uh brilliant chess minds are brilliant at everything and I was just wondering uh what do you think we in business can learn from chess?</p>
</details>

你提到这个很有趣，因为我父亲的父母出生在战前，他们非常喜欢所有美国和英国的东西，因为他们认为这些国家是战争的胜利者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's um funny you should mention that cuz um my uh father's parents uh they were born uh before the war they were very much into everything that's American and English because um that those were sort of what they saw as the victors of the war.</p>
</details>

他们家里有一本书，很早的时候就推荐给我，叫做《K Ultra》，我想那是一本翻译成挪威语的关于他们如何破解**Enigma密码**（Enigma code: 纳粹德国在二战中使用的加密系统）的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but one of the books they had at home which um they recommended to me at an early AG it was called uh K Ultra I think a translation for to Norwegian about how they cracked the Enigma code.</p>
</details>

但我直到电影《模仿游戏》（The Imitation Game）上映时才知道，国际象棋棋手也参与了其中，所以那个角度我之前并不了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I didn't know until the time of the um imitation game movie that actually chess players were involved in that so that angle I didn't really know.</p>
</details>

我还知道，在某个时候（我不知道具体是哪个时期），华尔街上至少有一家**对冲基金**（Hedge Fund: 一种采用多种投资策略，旨在获取超额收益的私人投资基金）积极招募国际象棋棋手，而且我认为至少有几个人因此获得了非常好的职业发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I also know that at some point I don't know exactly which but there was at least one hedge fund on Wall Street that was actively recruiting chess players and I think at least a couple of people made a really good career from from that.</p>
</details>

但我认为，从小下国际象棋无疑能教会你在有限的时间内解决复杂问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think playing chess at an early age certainly teaches you to solve complex problems in a limited amount of time.</p>
</details>

如果只是一直下国际象棋，可能在商业上走不远，但我认为这是一个很好的开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">continuing to only play chess probably will not get you far in business but I think it's a it's a good it's a good start.</p>
</details>

### 直觉与分析的平衡

当我们投资时，我们经常使用直觉，对吗？或者我们通常称之为模式识别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now um when we invest we use um intuition quite a bit right or we typically call it pattern recognition.</p>
</details>

当情况复杂、我们经验丰富且见过类似情况时，我们发现它很有用，这与你在**闪电战**（Blitz: 国际象棋中每方只有极短思考时间的快棋赛）中的做法非常吻合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we we find it useful when the situation is complex when we have a lot of experience and when we've seen similar situations before so pretty much bang in line with what you are doing in in Blitz.</p>
</details>

你如何看待直觉与分析之间的关系？你如何权衡或取舍？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you look at your intuition versus analysis just how how do you think about the trade-off or E Trade of?</p>
</details>

我认为国际象棋棋手，当你专业地、高水平地下棋时，你的大脑会真正地被训练去缩小搜索范围，并运用直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think chess players when you've when you play chess professionally at a high level your brain is really trained to narrow the search uh and to use intuition because you know there is a limited amount of time.</p>
</details>

因为你知道时间有限，所以你被训练去识别模式并做出这些快速决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so you're trained to recognize patterns and sort of make these quick quick decisions.</p>
</details>

我认为我就是那种更多地使用直觉的棋手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and I think I am very much the type of player who uses that more than than than others.</p>
</details>

我当然也能计算，基于更深入的分析做出更深思熟虑的决定，但这不一定是我的强项。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can certainly calculate make deeper decisions based on deeper analysis but it is not necessarily my forte.</p>
</details>

通常，当我输棋时，是因为对手深入研究了我凭直觉忽略的一些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">usually when I lose games it's because people have looked deeply at something that I've intuitively sort of um discarded.</p>
</details>

我想这在商业中也是一种获得优势的方式，毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I guess that's a way you can get an edge and in business as well for sure.</p>
</details>

但是你是否会用直觉来判断哪些方向需要更深入地分析？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but do you use intuition to figure out which directions to analyze more or um?</p>
</details>

绝对会，我使用我的直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely I use my intuition.</p>
</details>

那么你最终会得出多少种选择？你运用直觉后，会考虑多少种不同的替代方案？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how many do you end up with so you use your intuition you you then think about how many different Alternatives?</p>
</details>

我可以说，通常情况下，如果我考虑超过三种替代方案，那我就束手无策了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say as a rule if I think about more than three Alternatives I'm clueless.</p>
</details>

那样的话，我可能对任何一个都不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then I've uh then I've probably then I'm probably not happy with any of them.</p>
</details>

通常我会考虑两种选择，并且通常会对其中一种有所偏好，但我会尽量消除这种偏见，努力客观地看待两种选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um usually I think about two Alternatives of what to do and I usually have a bias uh towards one of them but I try and cut that out as much as I can uh and try and look at both Alternatives objectively.</p>
</details>

如果两者都不能让我满意，我可能会考虑第三种。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then again if both of them don't satisfy me I might look at a third.</p>
</details>

我听你以前说过，你觉得10到15分钟后你就不会增加太多价值了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I heard you somewhere say that you you felt that you didn't add much value after 10 15 minutes.</p>
</details>

我认为在10到15分钟之后，首先，我们的思维很难长时间保持所需的专注水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think after 10 15 minutes um that's when you first of all it's hard for our minds to to have the level of concentration that you need for much longer than that.</p>
</details>

但通常你会开始广泛地寻找其他替代方案，有时它们可能会有所帮助，但通常不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think you usually start looking pretty widely at diff at other Alternatives and sometimes they can load somewhere but usually they um they don't.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，对于一次相当深入的思考，大约15分钟可能是一个合适的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so yeah I would say for for a fairly deep think about 15 minutes is probably is probably a good time.</p>
</details>

我们经常看到人们过度分析情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well we we we often see people who overanalyze situations.</p>
</details>

那么，如果你在15分钟后继续思考，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so if you were to go on after 15 minutes what would happen then?</p>
</details>

15分钟后，我可能会扩大搜索范围，或者只是原地打转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">after 15 minutes I'll probably be widening the search and or just end up going in circles.</p>
</details>

所以在那之后我可能不会增加太多价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so I probably would not add too much value after that.</p>
</details>

而且我可能会因为我的思维过程有点混乱，最终下出我之前考虑过但后来忘记了为什么不好的棋步，因为那是20分钟前的事情了，我的大脑在那之后处理了很多信息，所以我忘记了一个关键的细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um I might end up cuz my thought process is not that um it's a bit chaotic so I might end up um playing a move that I that I was considering earlier and then I forgot why it was not good because it's it was 20 minutes ago and my brain had just processed a lot of information that since that time so I forgotten a crucial um crucial detail.</p>
</details>

思考太久确实会出很多问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a lot of things can go wrong if you think for too long that's for sure.</p>
</details>

我们在投资中经常看到，如果你花太多时间，你会变得更加确定，但决策质量并没有提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well what we see often in inves thing is that if you spend too much time on it you become more certain but not it but the decision doesn't improve.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常好的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's a very G good way to to put it actually.</p>
</details>

确实如此，通常如果我不是国际象棋的完美主义者，我是一个实用的棋手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and U that's that's true that often if I'm not a professionist in chess I am a practical player.</p>
</details>

我希望取得尽可能好的结果，并且知道我的时间有限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to um I want to get as good result as possible and then know that I I have limited limited time.</p>
</details>

但是你会看到很多完美主义者，他们思考45分钟，最终却下出了一个他们从一开始就肯定考虑过的明显棋步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh but you see a lot of perfectionists they think for 45 minutes and they end up making an obvious move that they certainly considered from the from the get-go.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这其中肯定有一些道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think there is certainly something in that.</p>
</details>

我只是有点个人化，我是说，你是世界排名第一的棋手，你已经把你的思维描述为混乱的，而且你也不是完美主义者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm just a slightly personal that I mean you you are the number one uh you know player in the world and you've already uh characterize your thinking as chaotic and uh you're not the perfectionist.</p>
</details>

那么你是怎么解释的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so how do you how do you tell you this?</p>
</details>

我想要学习，并且想在国际象棋上做到尽可能好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I am I I want to learn and I want to get as good at chess as possible.</p>
</details>

所以说我不是完美主义者有点不准确，但从某种意义上说，我不会为了确保不遗漏任何东西而扩大搜索范围。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I mean saying I'm not a perfectionist is slightly inaccurate it but it is in the sense that I will not sort of widen my search in order to make sure that I don't miss anything from from the get-go uh or at least I will rarely do that because I know it's not an effective usage of my time.</p>
</details>

因为我知道那不是有效利用我的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for everything in life if if we had unlimited time to make decisions we would make them quite differently but there's always this element of yeah I I have to make a decision at some point.</p>
</details>

我认为生活中的所有事情，如果我们有无限的时间来做决定，我们会有很大的不同，但总是有这个因素，是的，我必须在某个时候做出决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in investing we it's about uh long-term strategy and so on.</p>
</details>

现在在投资中，我们谈论的是长期策略等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how how long term how long term can you be how how far ahead do you think?</p>
</details>

你能做到多长远？你会提前多远思考？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when you start out how many moves have you thought about?</p>
</details>

当你开始时，你已经想了多少步棋？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">openings you usually have something something prepared but after that you have a general idea of what plants you want to you want to use what pawn structures are good what pieces would be good in those structures so with these patterns you can you can plan quite far ahead in in terms of what what do you want to achieve and where you eventually think you might um win the game so you always look far ahead but then you also have an opponent who constantly tries to ruin your plans so you have all the time you have both things in mind shortterm and long-term planning.</p>
</details>

开局通常你会有一些准备，但之后你对你想使用的计划、好的**兵结构**（Pawn Structures: 国际象棋中兵在棋盘上的排列方式，影响战略布局）以及在这些结构中哪些棋子会表现良好有一个大致的概念，所以通过这些模式，你可以在你想要实现的目标以及你最终认为可能赢得比赛的地方，提前相当长远地规划。所以你总是看得长远，但你也有一个对手不断试图破坏你的计划，所以你总是同时考虑短期和长期规划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when when do you find chess easy and when do you find it hard?</p>
</details>

你什么时候觉得国际象棋容易，什么时候觉得难？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I find chess easy when I can sort of play with flow when when the first thought that comes into my head is usually the right one then that's that's when it's uh that's when it it when it's easy when I'm always when I'm not when I'm on the front foot when I'm not reacting to what my opponent is doing that's like that's really U really important like very sure sign of bad form is that you uh um you see um your opponent's threats sort of before you see your own response because they should be uh they should sort of come at the same same time but yeah CH it's just easy when I can play with intuition that's a simple simple answer.</p>
</details>

当我能顺畅地发挥时，当我脑海中出现的第一个想法通常是正确的时候，我就觉得国际象棋容易。当我在进攻而不是被动应对对手的行动时，这非常重要。一个非常确定的状态不佳的迹象是，你看到对手的威胁先于你自己的应对，因为它们应该同时出现。但总的来说，当我能凭直觉下棋时，国际象棋就容易，这是一个简单的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in in chess you have uh perfect information.</p>
</details>

现在，在国际象棋中，你拥有**完美信息**（Perfect Information: 在博弈论中，指所有玩家都知道游戏的所有方面，包括其他玩家的行动和策略）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think would have happened if uh you didn't have perfect information like in like in business?</p>
</details>

如果你没有像商业中那样的完美信息，你认为会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so chess is unique in the sense that it's you have perfect information but it's still very difficult.</p>
</details>

国际象棋的独特之处在于你拥有完美信息，但它仍然非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I sort of think about it in the way that we are well informed we all sort of have the same tools but it's about how you use those those tools and the information um that you have.</p>
</details>

所以我把它看作是我们都消息灵通，我们都拥有相同的工具，但关键在于你如何使用这些工具和信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so yes we do have perfect information but I I I sort of I I don't see it that way cuz uh you still cannot you still cannot calculate every um every possibility.</p>
</details>

所以，是的，我们确实拥有完美信息，但我并不完全这么看，因为你仍然无法计算出所有的可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you also play poker a bit uh I also yeah I I've played a bit of Poker for sure yeah um where there is an element of John uh uh yeah that's annoying part that's the annoying part of playing playing poker.</p>
</details>

但你也玩一点扑克，是的，我也玩过一点扑克，当然，那里有约翰的元素，是的，那是玩扑克令人恼火的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I think that games like poker are different are interesting in a in a different sense.</p>
</details>

我认为像扑克这样的游戏在不同意义上很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what I feel is that the best players now they play in a different way so they play in a less uh exploitative style so they sort of treat the game as if everybody has the the same information rather than um they try and sort of create their game against uh as something that doesn't really depend on their um opponents in the in the in the end like they the game play is not that different I would say.</p>
</details>

但我感觉现在最好的玩家以不同的方式玩，他们采用一种不那么剥削性的风格，他们对待游戏的方式就好像每个人都拥有相同的信息，而不是试图创造一种不真正依赖于对手的游戏，最终，我认为他们的游戏方式并没有那么不同。

### 风险管理：保守与激进

谈到风险，你什么时候决定保守下棋，什么时候更冒险？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on to risk so um when do you decide to play conservatively and when do you play more risky?</p>
</details>

我在比赛中的激进程度和冒险程度，很大程度上取决于比赛情况和我的对手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my level of aggressiveness risk taking in a game uh depends a lot on the tournament situation but also on my opponents.</p>
</details>

面对更被动、稳健、规避风险的对手，我自然会承担更多风险，反之亦然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">against more passive opponents people who play solidly who are risk averse I will naturally take more risks and vice vice versa.</p>
</details>

如果我知道我面对的是一个非常激进的对手，我可能会采取更谨慎的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um if I know I'm playing a very aggressive opponent I might take a more cautious approach.</p>
</details>

为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why?</p>
</details>

因为我认为我不需要在比赛中制造不平衡，我的对手会制造这种不平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um because I think that I don't need to create imbalance in the game my opponent will create that balance imbalance.</p>
</details>

我普遍认为，从长远来看，比赛中的不平衡对我有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I generally believe that imbalance in the game in the long run is it's good for me.</p>
</details>

当然，短期内可能会很危险，但从长远来看，它会给我带来最好的结果，因为他们会失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of course in the short term it can be it can be dangerous but um in the long run it's it's going to yield me uh the best results because they they will fail.</p>
</details>

因为如果比赛更加不平衡，就会有更多决定性的比赛，平局会更少，既然我通常在这种情况下能做出更好的决定，我就会胜出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh because um because if the games are more imbalance they will there will be more decisive games fewer draws and since I was generally make better decisions in those situations I will I will come up out on top.</p>
</details>

如果你看到另一种情况，人们下得非常稳健，那么我可能不得不承担更多风险才能获得胜利的机会，有时我可能会过度冒险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um if you see another scenaria where people play really really solidly then I probably will have to take more risks in order to get chances to win and then I might sometimes overstretch.</p>
</details>

所以我感觉那些非常稳健但又擅长反击、抓住机会的人，就像你一样，你不能在没有反击威胁的情况下保持稳健。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I I I I feel like people who are really solid but also are good at counterattacking taking their chances like you not you cannot be solid without the threat of Counterattack.</p>
</details>

令人惊讶的是，有很多人很稳健但反击威胁很小，但那些反击者，我感觉他们是最危险的，毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's it's a surprising amount of people who are solid but with little counter attacking threat but the counter attackers those I feel are are the most dangerous for sure.</p>
</details>

你如何在赛前校准这些？你如何校准对手的风险承受能力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how can you calibrate this before the game how you how can you calibrate opponent's risk tolerance?</p>
</details>

这很大程度上取决于开局选择，例如你是否想把比赛引入更平静的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it comes down a lot to opening choices um whether you want to steer the game into more quiet Waters.</p>
</details>

有时，你希望计算机准备的元素持续多久。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">sometimes how long you want there to be an element of computer preparation maybe.</p>
</details>

如果你面对一个规避风险的对手，你可能会在开局阶段就让他们“脱离书本”，迫使他们尽早做出困难的高风险决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you if you're playing a risk averse opponent you will take them out of book so to say from the from the from the opening stage to force them to make difficult High uh High leverage decisions as early as possible.</p>
</details>

你对风险的态度随着年龄增长变化很大吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">has has your attitude to towards risk um changed a lot with age?</p>
</details>

我认为我的态度没有太大改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think uh my attitude hasn't changed changed that much.</p>
</details>

我可能在评估何时承担适当风险方面总体上有所提高，但你也会用年轻的冲劲来平衡这一点，这会让你承担更多风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I probably gotten better in general at assessing sort of what is what is the appropriate amount of risk to take at times but then you also counterbalance that with sort of youthful um youthful Spirit which makes it Tak take a bit more risk.</p>
</details>

我认为最终结果或多或少是一样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

### 团队协作与开局准备

谈到团队，你有一个团队帮你准备，对吗？团队是如何运作的？

<details>

<p class="english-text">moving on to to teams so um you you have a you have a team who helps you prepare right um what uh how does a teamw work?</p>
</details>

我现在没有一个大团队。

<details>

<p class="english-text">uh so right now I don't have a big team.</p>
</details>

过去我曾有不同的人为我工作，但现在我的主要教练是彼得（Peter）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've had different people working for me in the past but now I have my main coach Peter.</p>
</details>

他一直在帮助我，我认识他20年了，他现在担任我的主要教练已经11年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um who has been helping me I've known him for 20 years and he's been my main coach now for 11.</p>
</details>

对他来说，主要是计算机准备，寻找新的想法，这变得越来越困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for him it's mainly about computer preparation finding new ideas which is becoming more and more difficult um and basically providing me with a bit of a choice so I can I can decide what to do against um certain opponents and and that I I could sort of take it in in um in different directions.</p>
</details>

他基本上是给我一些选择，这样我就可以决定如何应对某些对手，并且我可以从不同的方向进行。

那么，工作日你是怎么安排的？你什么时候开始工作？

<details>

</details>

老实说，我最近在准备方面做得不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mainly play and prepare prepare for the games.</p>
</details>

我主要就是下棋和为比赛做准备。

<details>

</details>

我一直都在关注国际象棋，总是研究最新的比赛并进行练习，但我不会早上坐下来想我要做这个、那个和那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's sort of what my my coach does that he works on something new every day.</p>
</details>

那是我的教练做的事情，他每天都在研究新的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um does he find that out himself or you steer him?</p>
</details>

是他自己发现的，还是你引导他？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh sometimes I steer him sometimes he will start out working on something uh and then I will you know I will look at it see whether I like it or not.</p>
</details>

有时我引导他，有时他会开始研究一些东西，然后我会看看我是否喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but generally he's a lot better at this than I am uh and he also like he knows my preferences in general uh so he generally has an idea of of how to to do this.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，他在这方面比我好得多，而且他也了解我的偏好，所以他通常知道该怎么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but honestly I F I find the analysis opening analysis bit I don't find it that interesting it's more of a necessary thing to be able to to get uh new positions and to get situations where you can sort of prove your playing strength but I don't find it particularly interesting in itself so I'm really happy to to sort of delegate that in general.</p>
</details>

但老实说，我发现开局分析那部分并不那么有趣，它更多是为了获得新局面和能展现自己棋力的情况的必要手段，但它本身对我来说并不特别有趣，所以我很高兴能把这部分工作委托出去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but when you say he's better at it than you are better at what?</p>
</details>

但当你说他比你做得更好时，指的是什么方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh he's better at using at using computer engines to find new ideas basically using different engines um and comparing them um trying trying to go sort of a bit deeper in directions that the computer doesn't necessarily show at first trying to find ways that I can play where I sort of increase my opponent's risk more than than mine like where I can take risks but not not unacceptable risks but it is is is really getting it's really getting much more difficult.</p>
</details>

他更擅长使用计算机引擎来寻找新想法，基本上是使用不同的引擎并进行比较，试图在计算机最初不一定显示的方向上深入挖掘，寻找我能下棋的方式，从而增加对手的风险而不是我的风险，也就是说，我能承担风险但不是不可接受的风险，但这真的变得越来越困难了。

<details>

</details>

如果我们15年前谈论这个，他15年前也在做同样的工作，但当时是为世界冠军阿南德（Viswanathan Anand）工作，我想他会告诉你那时他的工作要容易得多，现在变得非常非常困难。

</details>

我当时并没有真正的教练，我通常会和一些人一起参加训练营，但我大部分时间都是自己做这些事情，而且深度远不及现在。我认为那时下差一点的开局也更容易过关。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um basically now everybody sort of knows everything there have been new ways that have been discovered that makes it so much more difficult um to to get a game so uh I think I could get by then I could not get by now without um without proper analysis.</p>
</details>

现在基本上每个人都知道所有事情，已经发现了新的方法，使得比赛变得更加困难，所以我想那时我还能应付，但现在如果没有适当的分析，我就无法应付了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">yeah um so I think for improving chess players having access to all this information at an early age at an early stage is great it's great to get you at a higher level earlier.</p>
</details>

是的，我认为对于进步中的国际象棋棋手来说，在早期就能接触到所有这些信息是非常棒的，它能让你更早地达到更高的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they used to say that back in the day like in order to learn a new opening that takes a month now even top players can just turn on their computer engine um by an opening course and within five hours like you can know like if of course if you like if you have the understanding and so on like you can you can pretty much know these things pretty well so um yeah it's just a it's just a different diff it's just a different age.</p>
</details>

他们过去常说，学习一个新的开局需要一个月的时间，而现在即使是顶级棋手也可以打开他们的计算机引擎，购买一个开局课程，在五个小时内，如果你有理解力等等，你就能很好地掌握这些东西。所以，是的，这只是一个不同的时代。

### 人工智能对国际象棋的影响

我认为计算机引擎对于观赏国际象棋来说非常棒，但对于棋手来说，它让比赛变得更难了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think computer engines have been great for spectating chess but for the players yeah it's made it more difficult.</p>
</details>

这是否意味着未来在国际象棋领域表现出色的人会有不同的人格类型？你认为呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">does that mean that there are different types of personalities which will do well in chess going forward what do you think?</p>
</details>

就目前而言，我把自己看作是混合一代，因为我确实是伴随着计算机长大的，但我并不依赖它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so for now I consider myself kind of a hybrid generation since I did grow up with computers but I would I was not reliant on them.</p>
</details>

我仍然花很多时间在棋盘和国际象棋书籍上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was still using a lot of time with the chess board and chess books as well.</p>
</details>

我认为我们现在看到的是第一代“纯计算机孩子”，他们下棋的方式不那么教条，更多地基于计算机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're seeing the first generation now of like pure computer kids uh and they play chess in in a less pragmatic uh sorry less dogmatic um more sort of computer based way in that they are less intuition based and so much more um sort of Brute Force calculation um so it's going to be interesting to see if this sort of new type of chess player beats the the older ones um that are more like me that are more based on on uh on F.</p>
</details>

他们的直觉较少，更多地依赖于暴力计算，所以看看这种新型棋手能否战胜像我这样更依赖直觉的老一代棋手会很有趣。

</details>

我认为我们已经看到了一代印度棋手，显然他们之间存在巨大的个体差异，但他们大多数人的共同点是计算能力极强，即使是那些对比赛完全没有理解的棋手（我通常指的是他们的直觉不那么好），他们也能计算得非常好，以至于在较长的时间控制下，他们仍然能应付自如，甚至给我这样的人带来非常大的麻烦。

</details>

当然有很多人对国际象棋充满热情并且也很有天赋，至于是否有人会成为下一个马格努斯或者有一天成为世界冠军，那可能会很难，特别是我们没有像印度那样庞大的基数，但我认为那并不那么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want people to um enjoy chess learn it at an early age so that you can have joy of it your life and if it can teach you other skills as well then that's even better.</p>
</details>

我希望人们能享受国际象棋，从小学习它，这样你就能从中获得一生的乐趣，如果它还能教会你其他技能，那就更好了。

### 持续学习与应对挫折

谈到学习，你在2013年成为世界冠军后说：“我离真正了解国际象棋还很远，还有很多东西可以学习，还有很多我不懂。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">moving on to um to learning so after um becoming World Champion in 2013 you said uh I'm still far away from really knowing chess really there is still much I can learn and there is much I still don't understand.</p>
</details>

你现在对此有何感受？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you feel about that now?</p>
</details>

嗯，我希望我能说些什么，不，其实我并不希望，因为那会很无聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I wish I could say something no actually I don't wish because that that would be woring.</p>
</details>

我会回顾我十年前的下棋方式，认为那时我在很多事情上都很天真。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I would look at the way that I played 10 years ago and think that I was coolest about a lot of things.</p>
</details>

我认为我现在下得更好，但其他人也下得更好，所以我的成绩不一定更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think I play better now but then also other people play better so my results are not necessarily better.</p>
</details>

但我感觉我一直在学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but I feel like I'm still learning all the time.</p>
</details>

我不认为我的职业生涯到了一个会彻底改变我下棋方式的阶段，但我确实觉得我对某些想法、某些局面的理解一直在发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I don't think I'm at a point in in my career where where I will drastically change the way that I play but I do feel that my understanding of certain ideas certain positions is always evolving.</p>
</details>

在国际象棋方面，你从哪次挫折中学到最多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what was the setback you learned the most from when it comes to chess?</p>
</details>

我一直非常乐观，几乎是盲目乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've always been very optimistic almost blindly so.</p>
</details>

所以我的国际象棋生涯中，我认为有两次半特定的时期，我停滞不前甚至有所退步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I've had I think two like two and have specific periods of my chess career where I've stagnated or even gone a bit back.</p>
</details>

它们都发生在19岁之前，在那些时期，我总是保持非常积极的心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um they were all before the the age of 19 and during those times I always kept a very positive mindset.</p>
</details>

我总是抱有相当妄想的想法，认为一切都会好转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always had pretty much delusional idea ideas of what was going on.</p>
</details>

我总是认为下一盘棋、下一次比赛就会好转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always thought that this is going to turn around next game next tournament.</p>
</details>

我可能获得了一个比我实际水平稍高的等级分，所以我非常努力地想达到那个水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I probably gained a rating that was a bit higher than my actual level so I was like trying to push really hard um to play towards that level.</p>
</details>

也许我承担了太多风险，有点强求，但我总是想：下一次，下一盘棋，下一次比赛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and maybe I was taking I was taking too many risks I was forcing a bit but I always thought like next time next game next tournament.</p>
</details>

然后突然之间，一切都好转了，每次都是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then all of a sudden it turned around and that's what H happened every single every single time.</p>
</details>

我只需要一个好的时刻，然后我就相信一切都会再次变得美好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that I just needed like one good moment and then I believed that everything was going to be going to be great again.</p>
</details>

从那时起，我当然也经历过糟糕的比赛，也有过两三个月不怎么下棋的时期，但我大部分时间都保持着同样的心态，即总体来说我在这方面非常出色，一切都会好转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and ever since then I've certainly had bad tournaments I've had like two three months periods where I don't play but I've sort of kept the same mindset most of the time that overall I think I'm really good at this and it's going to turn around.</p>
</details>

所以我在大型比赛或锦标赛中从未有过那种“这次需要一些时间才能恢复”的时刻，一切都出奇地顺利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so I haven't really had that one moment in a big tournament in a in a championship where I'm thinking like this is going to take some time to recover from it's always gone like remarkably remarkably well.</p>
</details>

### 积极心态与心理战

这很有趣，这种积极主义。你知道，积极的人也能赚更多钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well this interesting this positivism you know positive people also make more money.</p>
</details>

我一直认为，在国际象棋中，正确的平衡介于乐观和妄想之间，这就是你要去的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always think I've always thought in chess that the right balance is somewhere between optimistic and delusional that's where you're going.</p>
</details>

你说的“妄想”是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do what do you mean by delusional here?</p>
</details>

在国际象棋中，有些人是绝对妄想的乐观主义者，比如前世界冠军克拉姆尼克（Vladimir Kramnik）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you have people in chess who are like absolutely delusional optimists like uh former World Championship kramnick.</p>
</details>

每当我下完一盘棋，他都会说：“你真是奇迹般地活下来了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um whenever I um whenever I played a game uh he would say afterwards yeah it's a miracle you survived.</p>
</details>

他对我以及其他所有人都会这么说，我不知道他是否完全相信，但他速度超快，会滔滔不绝地说出各种变着，说明他本来可以如何赢棋，如果他没赢，那通常就是奇迹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and H he would say again against me and and everybody else and I don't know like I don't know if he completely believed it but then like he would he's super fast so he would rattle off variation after variation how he could potentially have won if he didn't win it was just it was usually Miracle.</p>
</details>

所以我可能更偏向乐观的一边，但我至少会稍微脚踏实地一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I'm probably more on the side that I'm on the optimistic side but I keep my my feet on the ground at least a little bit more more.</p>
</details>

但这是一种有趣的生存机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's an interesting kind of survival mechanism no.</p>
</details>

是的，我确实这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I I do think I do think so.</p>
</details>

如果你总是抱有稍微更乐观的态度，你就会抓住更多机会，你会看到更多机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if you always have a slightly more optimistic Outlook you will take more opportunities you you will see more opportunities.</p>
</details>

你会承担更多风险，你会给对手施加更大压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you will take more risks you will put more pressure on your opponents.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，是的，这是一件好事，据说也能让你更快乐，至少如果它能带来好结果的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think it's um uh yeah it's a it's a good thing also makes you a happier person supposedly at least if it gives good results right.</p>
</details>

但我的意思是，它让下棋变得更容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I mean it makes it sort of easier to um uh to to to play the game.</p>
</details>

通常当我下得最好的时候，我会凭直觉走一步棋，然后立刻发现一个原因，比如“哦，我错过了那个，也许那是个错误”，然后我会想“不，其实不是错误，我确实错过了一些东西，但我的乐观心态让我凭直觉快速做出了正确的决定”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um often when I play the best I'll make a move based on intuition and then I'll I'll spot a reason right after like oh I missed that one maybe that was a mistake and I'll think no actually it wasn't wasn't a mistake I missed something but still sort of my optimistic mindset made me make the right decision quickly based on intuition.</p>
</details>

如果你是个悲观的人，如果你想太多，你就不会那样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if you're a pessimistic person if you overthink you will not do that.</p>
</details>

这能解释那些“连胜”吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">does any this uh explain the kind of happy streaks?</p>
</details>

哦，是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh yeah for sure.</p>
</details>

我能回忆起那些连胜的时期，我只是不断赢棋，我觉得自己下得太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um uh I I can recall like streaks where I just go on winning winning and I think I'm like playing Amazing.</p>
</details>

然后我回头分析，发现其实并没有那么好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then I look back and analyze and it wasn't that great.</p>
</details>

那么是什么解释了这些结果呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what explains the the results then?</p>
</details>

因为我给对手施加了很大的压力，我的乐观和自信让他们失去了自信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because I put a lot of pressure on my opponents and my optimism and my confidence makes them less confidence.</p>
</details>

这种心理在国际象棋中有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how important is psychology these type of psychology in in chess?</p>
</details>

我认为心理学非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think psychology is very important.</p>
</details>

有很多人拥有相同的工具，很多人对比赛的理解至少与我相似。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you have these all these people who have the same tools like you have a lot of people who understand the game at a level that is at least similar to what I do.</p>
</details>

但只要他们没有正确的心态，他们就不可避免地不会承担足够的风险，他们会错失机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but as long as they don't have the right mindset they will inevitably um not take enough risks they will leave chances at the table.</p>
</details>

也许有些人过于乐观，他们会承担太多风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">maybe others they are too optimistic they will take too many risks.</p>
</details>

所以，拥有一个平衡的心态，知道何时该冒险，何时不该冒险，你显然不可能总是做出正确的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like having a balanced mindset like knowing where to when to go for it when to to not like you're obviously obviously never going to always make the right decisions.</p>
</details>

但是，如果你意识到这些事情，你最终会做出比对手更好的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but um yeah if you're conscious of these things like inevitably you're going to um to make better decisions than than your opponents.</p>

国际象棋过去是一个谜，没有人理解发生了什么，人类不得不解释，但现在人类只需要解释为什么引擎（基本上非常接近真相）会显示那样的分数，这意味着人们可以关注分数，老实说，大多数人看体育或比赛是为了娱乐，他们对所有技术方面并不那么感兴趣，他们主要想看比分，看看谁赢了，如果速度快，那就更好了，所以我认为总的来说，不，我对国际象棋仍然受欢迎并不特别惊讶。

<p class="english-text">would if it have been as popular if it was invented now?</p>

如果它现在才被发明，它还会这么受欢迎吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm not sure but chess has such a rich historical background as well as modern to tools to follow it so I think um probably a lot of good things are still in store.</p>

我不确定，但国际象棋拥有如此丰富的历史背景，以及现代的工具来追踪它，所以我认为，可能还有很多好事情在等着我们。

### 个人生活与未来展望

最后几个问题，你有没有经历过**冒名顶替综合症**（Impulser Syndrome: 又称冒充者综合症，指尽管有外部证据证明其能力，个体仍认为自己不够好或不配成功）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">last few questions here do have you ever had the impulser syndrome?</p>
</details>

我并不认为自己特别聪明、天才或智力超群，所以是的，我曾有过这样的时刻，我看到我认为比我聪明的人在国际象棋上表现更差，这真的让我有时怀疑自己是否真的这么好，是不是所有人都只是在愚弄我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't consider myself particularly brilliant genius or or that intelligent so yes I've had times where I've seen people whom I consider to be smarter than I am do worse at chess and it m really makes me wonder whether sometimes whether I'm actually this good are PE are everybody just fooling me?</p>
</details>

最近这种感觉少了，我现在更多地接受了它，但我曾遇到过一些杰出的人，他们和我说话时好像我是房间里最聪明的人，这让我很不舒服，因为我把自己看作一个聪明但不算天才的人，只是碰巧找到了自己能做得非常好的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um less recently I've sort of accepted it more now but I've had brilliant people talk to me as if I'm the smartest person in the room and that really makes me uncomfortable because I see myself as an intelligent but not brilliant guy who happened to find the one thing that he can do really really well.</p>
</details>

你认为这种心态是你如此成功的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think this mindset is the reason why you're being so successful?</p>
</details>

我认为这种心态无疑让我保持了脚踏实地，我认为这对我的国际象棋生涯非常有益，但我不能说这就是原因，因为我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this mindset has definitely kept me I kept me grounded and I think it's been really good for me in chess but I cannot say that this or that is the reason because I don't know.</p>
</details>

有没有哪位导师或教练的建议让你铭记至今？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is there a piece of advice from a mentor or coach that has stuck with you forever?</p>
</details>

多年来我得到了很多好建议，但我认为最好的建议可能是我在很小的时候从西兰（C Lan）那里得到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've had a lot of good advice over the years but I think maybe the best advice that I got was from C Lan at a fairly early age.</p>
</details>

他不是我的主要教练，但他可能每周或每两周会和我见面一次，取决于我是否参加比赛等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">he was not my main coach or anything but we would probably meet up once a week or every two weeks depending on whether I was playing tournaments and so on.</p>
</details>

然后我们会回顾我的一些比赛，有一次他注意到我连续几盘黑棋都下了**西西里防御**（Sicilian Defense: 国际象棋开局中一种常见的防御策略）的同一个变着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and then we would go through some of my games and once he noticed that for a few black games in a row I'd played the same variation of the Sicilian Defense.</p>
</details>

他说：“我不在乎你认为这个开局是好是坏，如果你不去探索，你就不会学习。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he said I don't care whether you consider this to be good or a bad opening if you're not going if you're not going to um explore then you're not going to learn.</p>
</details>

所以他走到书架前，他和我一样，不是一个很有条理的人，他走到书架前，说：“这本书，这个开局，去学这个。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so he said he just went to a shelf like he's he's like me he's not a very organized person he went to the shelf and he said said this book this opening learn this instead.</p>
</details>

于是我学会了那个开局，在下一盘棋中尝试了，然后我又尝试了其他东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I learned that open opening I tried that in the next game then I then I tried something tried something else.</p>
</details>

这种始终保持好奇心，思考学习而不是墨守成规的心态对我来说非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that thing like always being curious thinking about learning rather than being um stuck in in sort of the same comfortable patterns has been has been really important to me.</p>
</details>

除了高尔夫，你现在生活中还在尝试学习和探索其他什么东西？

<details>

<p class="english-text">and in addition to to golf what are other things you're trying to learn and explore in your in your normal life these days?</p>
</details>

我正在尝试学习西班牙语，因为过一段时间我将搬到西班牙。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm I'm trying to learn Spanish um because I will be moving to Spain after a bit.</p>
</details>

你为什么要搬到西班牙？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why are you moving to Spain?</p>
</details>

因为天气。

我经历了很多挪威的冬天，但我感觉自己足够幸运，可以选择住在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um I've I've had you know um I've had a lot of winters in Norway but I feel like I'm privileged enough that I can I can sort of choose more where to to live.</p>
</details>

我仍然想在挪威度过一些时间，但我可能不想在这里度过六个月的冬天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I still want to spend time in Norway but I probably don't want to spend six months of winter here.</p>
</details>

除此之外，我的生活乐趣相当简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but apart from that I have fairly Simple Pleasures in in life.</p>
</details>

去年我曾想过要尝试开辟一条新的职业道路，可以与国际象棋同时进行，但到目前为止我还没有真正找到，而且到目前为止我也没有因此感到不快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I had times last year where I thought that I was going to try and carve out sort of a new career path that I could pursue at the same time as chess but so far I haven't really found it and also so far I haven't been any less happy because of it.</p>
</details>

最后，你对年轻人有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now last thing um what is your advice to young people?</p>
</details>

保持好奇心，学习，阅读，下国际象棋，但不要把它作为职业，除非你能成为世界第一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">be curious learn read and play chess but don't pursue it as a career unless you're going to be the best in the world.</p>
