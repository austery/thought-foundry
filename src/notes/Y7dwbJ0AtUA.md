### AI产品形态的演变与未来展望

我认为我们尚未知晓最终产品的具体形态。一个显而易见的历史类比是，个人电脑从1975年发明到1992年，基本上都是一个文本提示系统，历经17年。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think we don't yet know the shape and form of the ultimate products. Just one just obvious historical analogy is you know the personal computer from sort of invention in 1975 through to you know basically 1992 was a text prompt system 17 years in you know the whole industry took a left turn into gooies and never looked back and then by the way you know 5 years after that the industry took a left turn into web browsers and never looked back right and you know look I'm I'm sure there will be chat bots 20 years from now but I'm pretty confident that both the current chatbot companies and many new companies are going to figure out many kinds of user experiences that are radically different that we don't we don't even know</p>
</details>

之后，整个行业转向了**GUI**（Graphical User Interface: 图形用户界面），再也没有回头；又过了五年，行业转向了网页浏览器，同样再也没有回头。我相信20年后仍然会有聊天机器人，但我相当确信，无论是当前的聊天机器人公司还是许多新公司，都将开发出我们现在甚至无法想象的、截然不同的用户体验。

Eric Torberg: 请大家和我一起欢迎Marc Andreessen和Ben Horowitz，以及普通合伙人Eric Torberg。

<p class="english-text">Please join me in welcoming Mark Andre and Ben Horowitz with general partner Eric Torberg.</p>
</details>

Ben: 谢谢你带来摇滚乐，Kim。是谁做的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for the rock Kim. Who did that?</p>
</details>

Eric: Ben选的音乐。Marc，最近有很多关于**LLM**（Large Language Model: 大型语言模型）局限性的讨论，认为它们无法真正发明新的科学，无法拥有真正的创造性天赋，而只是组合或包装现有内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben picks the Ben picked the music. Mark, there's been a lot of talk lately about the limitations of LLMs that they they can't do true invention of say new science that they can't do true creative genius that it's just combining or packaging.</p>
</details>

Eric: 你对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have thoughts here. What say you?</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的，对我来说，你总会遇到这些问题。它们通常围绕着“语言模型是否智能，即它们能否真正处理信息并产生概念上的突破，就像人类一样？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, so for me, yes, you get all these questions and yeah, they usually come in either, you know, sort of are are language models intelligent in the sense of like can they actually um you know, can they actually process information and have sort of conceptual breakthroughs? the way that people can.</p>
</details>

Marc: 还有就是“语言模型或视频模型是否具有创造力，即它们能否创造新的艺术，真正实现创造性突破？”当然，我对这两个问题的回答都是：“人类能做到这些吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then there's are language models or or video models creative, you know, can they can they create new art? Um actually have genuine creative breakthroughs. And of course my my my answer to both of those is well can people do those things?</p>
</details>

Marc: 我认为这里有两个问题：即使有些人被认为是“智能的”，能够拥有原创的概念性突破，而不仅仅是重复训练集或遵循脚本，那么有多少比例的人能真正做到这一点？我说我只见过少数几个，其中一些就在这个房间里，但并不多，大多数人从未做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and um I think there's two two two questions there which is like okay even if some people are quote unquote intelligent as in having original uh conceptual breakthroughs and not just let's just say regurgitating the training set um uh or following scripts um uh how you know what percentage of people can actually do that and I say I've only met a few some of them are here in the room um but uh you know not that many most people never do and then creativity I mean how many people are actually genuinely creative right and so you you kind of point to a Beethoven or you know Van Gogh or something like that you're like Okay, that's creativity and yeah, that's creativity and then how many Beethovenas and Van Go are there? Obviously, not very many.</p>
</details>

Marc: 至于创造力，有多少人是真正有创造力的？你可能会提到贝多芬或梵高，你会说那是创造力，是的，那是创造力，但世界上有多少贝多芬和梵高呢？显然不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then creativity I mean how many people are actually genuinely creative right and so you you kind of point to a Beethoven or you know Van Gogh or something like that you're like Okay, that's creativity and yeah, that's creativity and then how many Beethovenas and Van Go are there? Obviously, not very many.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，一方面，如果这些事物能够达到99.99%的人类的水平，那本身就相当有趣。但如果你深入挖掘，你会发现，与仅仅是重新组合想法相比，人类历史上真正概念上的突破到底有多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so one is just like okay, like you know, if it's if it if if if these things clear the bar of, you know, 99.99% of humanity, you know, then that's pretty interesting just in and of itself. But then I you dig into it further and you're like, okay, like how many actual real conceptual breakthroughs have there ever ever been actually ever in human history as compared to sort of remixing remixing ideas.</p>
</details>

Marc: 看看技术史，几乎总是这样：重大的突破是至少40年，也就是四个十年努力的结果。事实上，语言模型本身就是八十年先前工作的结晶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you know like if you look at the history of technology it's almost always the case that the big breakthroughs are the result of you know usually at least 40 years of sort of work ahead of time you know four decades right in fact language models themselves are the culmination of eight decades right of previous work and so there's remixing and then in the arts it's the exact same thing you know novels and music and everything like you know there are clearly creative leaps but you know there's just tremendous amounts of influence that came in from from people who came before and even if you think about like somebody with the creativity of a Beethoven like there There's a lot of Beethoven in Mozart and Heiden and in the composers that came before and so there's just tremendous amounts of of of remixing and combination.</p>
</details>

Marc: 艺术领域也是如此，小说、音乐等等，显然有创造性的飞跃，但其中包含了大量来自前人的影响。即使你想到像贝多芬这样有创造力的人，莫扎特和海顿以及他之前的作曲家身上也有很多贝多芬的影子，所以存在大量的重组和组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then in the arts it's the exact same thing you know novels and music and everything like you know there are clearly creative leaps but you know there's just tremendous amounts of influence that came in from from people who came before and even if you think about like somebody with the creativity of a Beethoven like there There's a lot of Beethoven in Mozart and Heiden and in the composers that came before and so there's just tremendous amounts of of of remixing and combination.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，这是一个有点像“天使在针尖上跳舞”的问题：如果你能达到世界顶尖、世代相传的创造力或智能的0.001%的水平，那你可能就已经成功了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's it's it's a little bit of an angel's dancing on the head of a pin question which is like if you can get if you can get you know within you know I don't know one you know 001% of of kind of worldbeating uh you know generational creativity intelligence like you're you're you're probably all the way there.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，情感上我希望人类的创造力仍然有其特殊之处，我当然相信这一点，我也非常希望相信这一点。但当我使用这些东西时，我会觉得它们似乎非常聪明，非常有创造力。所以我相当确信它们会达到这个标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I so emotionally I want to like hold out hope that there is you know still something special about human creativity and I I certainly believe that and I and I and I very much want to believe that but um I don't know when I use these things I'm like wow they seem to be awfully smart and awfully creative. So I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty convinced that they're going to clear the bar.</p>
</details>

Eric: 是的。这似乎是你分析中的一个共同主题，当人们谈论**LLM**（大型语言模型）的局限性时，比如它们能否进行**迁移学习**（transfer learning: 将从一个任务中学到的知识应用到另一个相关任务上）或一般的学习，你似乎总会问：“人类能做到这些吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. the I think that seems to be a common theme in your analysis when when people talk about the limitations of LMS, you know, can they do transfer learning or or just learning in general? You seem to ask, can people do this?</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。人类能做到这些吗？这就像是**横向思维**（lateral thinking: 跳出常规，从不同角度思考问题）一样，对吧？所以，这就像是在分布内或分布外进行推理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Can people do these things? Well, it's like lateral thinking, right? So, yeah, so it's like reasoning in or out of distribution, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 我认识很多人非常擅长在分布内进行推理。但实际上，我认识多少人擅长在分布外进行推理并进行迁移学习呢？答案是：我认识少数几个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's like, okay, I know a lot of people who are very good at reasoning inside distribution. How many people do I actually know who are good at reasoning outside of distribution and doing transfer learning? And and the answer is like I know a handful.</p>
</details>

Marc: 我认识几个人，每当你问他们一个问题，他们总能给出极其原创的答案。通常，这个答案会涉及从某个相邻领域引入一个想法，并能够跨领域进行连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I I know a few I know a few people um where whenever you ask them a question, you get an extremely original answer. And usually that answer involves bringing in some idea from some adjacent space and basically being able to bridge domains.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，你可能会问他们一个关于金融的问题，他们会从心理学中给你一个答案；或者你问他们一个关于心理学的问题，他们会从生物学中给你一个答案，诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so you know you'll ask them a question about I don't know you know finance and they'll they'll bring you an answer from psychology or you ask them a question about psychology and they'll bring you an answer from biology right or whatever it is.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我认识，我不知道，今天坐在这里，大概有三个人能可靠地做到这一点，而我的通讯录里有10,000人。所以，10,000人中只有三个人，这个比例并不高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I I know you know I know I don't know sitting here today probably three I probably know three people who can do that reliably out of the you know I I've got you know I've got 10,000 in my address book. Um and so three out of 10,000</p>
</details>

Marc: 顺便说一句，我觉得这非常令人鼓舞。是的，房间里的气氛立刻变得非常糟糕。我发现这非常令人鼓舞，因为看看人类能够建造出什么，对吧？尽管我们有所有的局限性，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. is not is not that high a percentage. By by the way, I find this very encouraging. Like I I yeah, immediately the mood in the room has gone completely to hell. Um I find this very encouraging. I find this very encouraging because look at what humanity has been able to build, right? Despite all of our limitations, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 看看我们所展现出的所有创造力，所有令人惊叹的艺术、电影、小说，以及所有令人惊叹的技术发明和科学突破。所以，我们凭借现有的局限性，已经能够做到我们所能做到的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and look at all the creativity that we've been able to exhibit and all the amazing art and all the amazing movies and all the amazing novels and all the amazing technical inventions and scientific breakthroughs. And so we, you know, we've been able to do, you know, everything we've been able to do with the limitations that we have.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我认为，你是否需要达到100%确定它正在进行原创思考的程度？我不这么认为。我认为如果能做到那会很棒，而且我认为最终我们可能会得出结论，这就是正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, you know, I think that, you know, like, you know, do you need to get to the thing where you are 100% positive that's actually doing, you know, original thinking? I don't think so. Uh, I I think it'd be great if you did, and I think ultimately we'll probably conclude that that's what's happening.</p>
</details>

Marc: 但这对于实现巨大的改进来说并不是必需的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but like I it's not necessary for like just tremendous amounts of improvement.</p>

### AI与人类智能、创造力之辩

Eric: Ben，我们上周在你的“Paid in Full”活动上刚刚庆祝了一些嘻哈传奇人物，所以你对创造性天赋思考很多。你如何看待这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben, we were just celebrating some some hip-hop legends at your paid in full uh event last week and so you think a lot about creative genius. How do you think about this question?</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的，我的意思是，我同意Marc的观点，无论它是什么，它都非常有用，即使它没有达到那个水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean I think that uh I agree with Mark that it's whatever it is, it's very useful. um even if it isn't all the way that level uh I think that</p>
</details>

Ben: 我认为，人类对实际的、实时的**人类体验**（human experience: 指人类在生活中所经历的一切，包括情感、感知、认知等）非常投入，至少在艺术方面是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know there's something about the actual like real time human experience that humans are very into um at least in art where</p>
</details>

Ben: 以目前的技术状况来看，预训练数据还没有完全达到你真正想要的效果。但它已经相当不错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know with the current state of the technology kind of the the pre-training doesn't have quite the the right data to to to get to um what you really want to Uh but it, you know, it's pretty good.</p>
</details>

Marc: 它确实很不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is pretty good.</p>
</details>

Marc: 那么，有多少真正的概念创新者呢？Ben，Ben的非营利活动之一是“Paid in Full基金会”，旨在表彰并实际上为说唱和嘻哈领域的伟大创新者提供养老金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many So how many true conceptual So Ben Ben Ben Ben's Ben, one of Ben's nonprofit activities is something called the Pain and Fall Foundation, which is honoring and actually providing essentially a pension a pension for uh you know, for sort of, you know, the great innovators in in in rap and hip-hop.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以他认识并拥有许多我们刚刚参加的活动中的该领域过去50年的领军人物，他们会表演，见到他们并与他们交谈真的很有趣。但是，在过去50年中，你认为这个领域有多少人可以被归类为真正的概念创新者呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so he has he knows and has many of we were just at the event and he you know has many of the kind of leading lights of that field for the last 50 years you know perform and and it's really fun to meet them and talk to them. Um but like how many people in that entire field over the course of the last 50 years would you classify as like a true conceptual innovator?</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的。嗯，这很有趣。这取决于你如何广义地定义它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, you know it's interesting. Well, it depends how broadly you define it but</p>
</details>

Ben: 但上周六有几位。Rock Kim，你肯定会把他归入这一类。Dr. Dre，你肯定会把他归入这一类。George Clinton，你肯定会把他归入这一类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know there were several of them there last you know on Saturday. Rock, I think. Yeah, Rockm, you'd certainly put in that category. Dr. Dre, you'd certainly put in that category. George Clinton, you'd certainly put in that category. Um,</p>
</details>

Ben: 从更狭义的角度来看，像Cool G Rap肯定也有新的想法。但这取决于，如果要说根本性的音乐突破，你可能只会提到Rock Kim和George Clinton。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, in a narrower sense, like Cool G Rap certainly had a new idea. Um, but you know, it depends like a fundamental kind of musical breakthrough, you probably just say like Rock Kim and George Clinton. Um, are they excited?</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，只有两个人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so two out of</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，我的意思是，那些是当时在场的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean those of the guys who were there.</p>
</details>

Marc: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的，但这是一个非常小的比例。非常非常小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But yeah, it's a tiny percentage. Tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny.</p>
</details>

Eric: 我们昨晚与Jared Leto进行了炉边谈话。他谈到好莱坞有多少人对此感到非常害怕或反对。你和Dr. Dre、Nas、Kanye交谈时，他们兴奋吗？他们在用它吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had Jared at the fireside last night with Jared Leto. He was talking about how many people in Hollywood are are really scared or against this um what's happening here is is what do you see in you know when you talk to the Dr. JS the nas the Kanye's are they excited? Are they using it? Are they</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的，我跟他们聊过，音乐界肯定有人害怕，但也有很多人非常非常感兴趣，尤其是嘻哈界的人，因为这几乎就像是他们曾经做过的事情的重演——他们只是拿其他音乐，然后在此基础上创作出新的音乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, I the so everybody uh who I speak to there are definitely people who are scared in music but like there are a lot of people who are very very interested in it and particularly the hip-hop guys are interested because um it's almost like a replay of what they did right that they just took other music and they kind of built new music out of it and I think that you know AI is uh a fantastic creative tool for them.</p>
</details>

Ben: 我认为AI对他们来说是一个绝佳的创意工具，极大地扩展了他们的创作范围。对于嘻哈音乐的很大一部分来说，它是在讲述一个特定时间和地点的非常具体的故事，而拥有深入的知识并只针对那件事进行训练，实际上是一种优势，而不是像一个普遍聪明的音乐模型那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like way opens up the pallet and then for you know a lot of what hip-hop is is it's um kind of telling a very specific story of a specific time and place which um having intimate knowledge and being trained just on that thing is is actually an advantage as opposed being like a generally smart uh music model.</p>
</details>

Ben: 人们也用同样的逻辑，认为更智能的会统治不那么智能的。Marc，你最近...

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, people also use the same logic of, hey, whatever is more intelligent will rule whatever is less intelligent. And and Mark, you recently uh</p>

Ben: 是的，没错。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly.</p>
</details>

Eric: Marc，你最近发推文说：“一个至高无上的形状旋转器只能旋转形状，但一个至高无上的文字单元可以旋转形状旋转器。”而且...

<p class="english-text">Mark, you recently tweeted, "A supreme shape rotator can only rotate shapes, but a supreme word cell can rotate shape rotators." And and also,</p>

Marc: 是的。这意味着什么？是的。所以，博士们都为MBA工作，对吧？所以，是的，我的意思是，把它提升一个层次来看。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. What what means? Uh yeah. So it's the PhDs all work for MBAs, right? So it's like, you know, okay. So yeah, like so yeah. Well, I just, you know, just take it up a level.</p>

Marc: 看看今天的世界，你认为我们是由聪明人统治的吗？这是你从时事中得出的最大结论吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just like when you look at the world today, do you think we're being ruled by the smart ones, right? Like is that is that your big conclusion from like current events, current affairs,</p>
</details>

Marc: 就像，好吧，我们让天才来掌权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Like okay, we put the geniuses in charge. Like</p>
</details>

Eric: 你是说Kamala和Trump不是最好的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you mean Kamla and Trump aren't the best?</p>
</details>

Marc: 嗯，现在我们甚至不要特指美国。我们看看全世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, now let's not even be specific towards the US. let's just look all over the world.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。所以，就像是，有这么一回事。我认为有两件事是真实的。一是我们可能都低估了智力的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, yeah. And so like it's just like there's this thing. So I think two two things are true. One is we we probably all kind of underwrite the importance of intelligence.</p>
</details>

Marc: 实际上，这里有一个完整的背景故事，关于智力在过去一百年里出于各种原因，实际上成为了一个极具煽动性的敏感话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and actually there's a whole kind of backstory here of like intelligence actually turns out to be this like incredibly inflammatory, you know, kind of topic for lots of reasons over the last hundred years. um uh which which we could we could talk about in great detail but like it it and you know it's and the even the just the very idea that like some people are smarter than other people you just like really freaks people out and people people don't like to talk about it we really struggle with that as a society and so like and then it is true that intelligence is like in humans intelligence is correlated to almost every kind of positive life outcome right</p>
</details>

Marc: 我们可以详细讨论，但仅仅是有些人比其他人更聪明这个想法，就让人们非常不安，人们不喜欢谈论它，我们作为一个社会对此非常挣扎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the even the just the very idea that like some people are smarter than other people you just like really freaks people out and people people don't like to talk about it we really struggle with that as a society and so like and then it is true that intelligence is like in humans intelligence is correlated to almost every kind of positive life outcome right</p>
</details>

Marc: 智力确实与人类几乎所有积极的生活结果相关。在社会科学中，他们通常会告诉你，所谓的**流体智力**（fluid intelligence: 指在不依赖现有知识的情况下解决新问题的能力）或G因子或IQ，与几乎所有事物都有0.4的关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so u intelligence generally in the social sciences what they'll tell you is what they call fluid intelligence or or the G factor or IQ is sort of it's sort of 0.4 four correlated to basically everything.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，它与教育成果、职业成果、收入，以及生活满意度，甚至是非暴力（即能够不通过肢体暴力解决问题）等都有0.4的关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so it's 0.4 correlation to like educational outcomes and like you know professional outcomes and and you know income and by the way also like life satisfaction and by the way non-violence you know being able to solve problems without physical violence and so forth.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，一方面，我们可能都低估了智力。另一方面，那些从事与智力相关领域的人可能高估了智力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so like on the one hand like we probably all underrate intelligence. Um on the other hand the people who are in the fields that involve intelligence probably overrate intelligence.</p>
</details>

Marc: 你甚至可以创造一个词，比如“智力至上主义者”，他们认为智力非常重要，所以它可能是最重要或唯一重要的东西。但当你审视现实时，你会发现情况显然并非如此。

<p class="english-text">Um, and you might even you might even coin a term like maybe like intelligence supremacist or something like that where it's just like oh like intelligence is very important and so therefore maybe it's like the most important thing or the only thing but but then you look at reality and you're like okay that's clearly not the case.</p>

Eric: 是的。它仍然只有0.4，对吧？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's still zero only 0.4 right. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Marc: 嗯，首先它只有0.4。在社会科学中，0.4是一个巨大的相关系数，对吧？大多数事物，无论是基因还是观察到的行为，与社会科学中的任何事物相关联时，相关性都远小于0.4。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well so to start with it's only 0.4 and you know in the social sciences 0.4 is a giant correlation factor right like most most things that where you can correlate whether it's you know genes or observed behavior whatever to anything in the social sciences the correlations are much smaller than that.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以0.4虽然很小，但仍然只有0.4。所以，即使你是一个完全的基因决定论者，认为基因IQ驱动所有这些结果，它仍然无法解释60%的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So 0.4 is is tiny, but it's still only 0.4. So, even if you're like a fullon if you even if you're like a full-on genetic determinist and you're just like, you know, genetic IQ just like drives all these outcomes, like it still doesn't explain, you know, 6 uh of the correlation and so that leaves it but but that's just on the individual level.</p>
</details>

Marc: 但这只是在个体层面。然后你看看集体层面。在集体层面，有一个著名的观察结果：你把一群人放在一起，形成一个群体，这个群体会比平均水平更愚蠢，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you just look at the collective level. Well, you just look at the collective level and it's like a famous famous observation is you take a b you take a bunch of you take any group of people, you put them in a mob and the mob is dumber, right, than the average and and and you put a bunch of smart people in a mob and they definitely turn dumber like and you see that all the time, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 你把一群聪明人放在一个群体中，他们肯定会变得更愚蠢，你总是能看到这种情况，对吧？所以，你把人们放在群体中，他们的行为会非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh and so you put people in groups and they they they behave very differently and then you you create and then you create these you know questions around like who's in charge whether who's in charge at a at a company or who's in charge of a of a country and like it it's whatever the filtration process it's clearly not it's not it's it's not it's certainly not only on IQ and it may not even be primarily on IQ and so so therefore it's just like this assumption that you kind of hear in some of the AI circles uh which is like inevitably the smart you know kind of thing is going to govern the dumb thing like I I just think that's like very easily uh it's just sort of very easily and obviously falsified like intelligence isn't sufficient and then you just you just you just convey it.</p>
</details>

Marc: 然后你就会产生关于谁掌权的问题，无论是公司还是国家，无论过滤过程是什么，显然它不只是基于IQ，甚至可能不主要是基于IQ。

Marc: 所以，在某些AI圈子里你听到的这种假设，即不可避免地，聪明的东西会统治愚蠢的东西，我认为这很容易被证伪。智力是不够的。

Marc: 所以，成功以及谁掌权，除了纯粹的智力之外，显然还有许多其他因素。这就引出了一个后续问题：这些因素可能是什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and so there there's there there must be there obviously are and there and there in fact must be many other factors that have to do with success um and have to do with like who's in charge than just raw intelligence. It it begs the the follow-up question of what are what are some examples of what that might be you know skills sort of outside of intelligence and more particularly specifically why couldn't AI systems you know learn them?</p>
</details>

Marc: 智力之外的技能，更具体地说，为什么AI系统不能学习它们？Ben，除了智力之外，根据你的经验，还有什么决定了领导力、创业精神、解决复杂问题或组织人员的成功？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So Ben like what what what other than intelligence what what in your experience determines for example success in leadership or in entrepreneurship or in in solving complex problems or organizing people?</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的。有很多因素。例如，其中很大一部分是能够以正确的方式进行对抗。这其中有一些智力成分，但更多的是真正理解你正在与谁交谈。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. There there are many things um you know like a lot of it is uh being able to have a confrontation in the correct way and like there's some intelligence in that but a lot of it is just under really understanding who you're talking to</p>
</details>

Ben: 能够解读他们思考问题的一切，并通常通过公司员工的视角而不是你自己的视角来看待决策，这是通过不断与人交流、理解他们所说的话等方式培养出来的技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know being able to interpret everything about how they're thinking about it and just kind of generally seeing decisions through the eyes of the people working in the company not through your eyes is the skill that you you know you develop by talking to people all the time, understanding what they're saying, so forth, these kinds of things.</p>
</details>

Ben: 这肯定不是智商问题。我能想象一个AI对任何个体进行训练，然后完全理解并知道该说什么等等。但你还需要将其与业务应该做什么结合起来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And it's just um you know, it's certainly not an IQ thing.

Ben: 所以你不是在尝试做受欢迎的事情。你是在努力让人们做正确的事情，即使他们不喜欢。这就是管理工作的很大一部分。

<p class="english-text">So you're not you're not trying to do what's popular. You're trying to get people to do what's correct even if they don't like it. And you know that's a lot of management. So uh it's not a problem anybody's working on currently but maybe they will.</p>

Ben: 是的，人们想要什么，这与需要做什么相结合，然后他们有多有才华，你能负担得起哪些人，如果他们跳窗也没关系，哪些人不行，诸如此类。这其中有很多奇怪的微妙之处，而且非常情境化。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. what you know what do people want like you know married to you know what needs to be done and then like how talented are they like which ones can you afford like if they jump out the window it's fine you know which one's not fine you know this kind of thing it's a there's a lot of like weird subtleties to it uh and it's very situational</p>

Ben: 我认为最困难的事情，以及管理书籍如此糟糕的原因，就是它具有情境性。你的公司、产品、人员、组织结构图与“这是制定策略的五个步骤”非常不同。

<p class="english-text">I think the hardest thing about it uh and why management books are so bad is because it's situational um you know like your company your product, your people, your org chart is very very different than you know, yeah, here are the five steps to building a strategy.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like, well, that's the most useless thing I ever read because it has nothing to do with you.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，关于这一点，一个有趣的事情是，**心智理论**（Theory of Mind: 理解他人心理状态，如意图、信念、欲望等的能力）的概念非常重要，对吧？心智理论是指你能在脑海中模拟别人脑海中发生的事情，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the interesting things on this like on this is right the the concept of theory of mind is really important, right? So, theory of mind is can you in your head model what's happening in the other person's head, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 你可能会认为，也许聪明人应该更擅长这一点。但事实证明，这可能不是真的，原因如下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and and you would think that maybe that you know maybe obviously people who are smarter should be better at that. It turns out that that may not be true and I'll the reason to believe that that's not true which which is as follows.</p>
</details>

Marc: **美国军方**（US Military）是IQ测试的早期采用者，并一直是美国社会中IQ测试的主要采用者。他们基本上通过**ASVAB**（Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery: 武装部队职业能力倾向测验）来筛选，他们称之为职业能力倾向测验，但它本质上就是IQ测试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the so the the US military is was the early adopter and has continued to be sort of the leading adopter in in US society of of of actually IQ testing and they uh they they they basically launder it through something called the ASVAB which is their they call vocational aptitude battery test but it's basically an I it's essentially an IQ test.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以他们仍然使用明确的IQ测试，并根据IQ将人们分配到不同的专业和角色，包括领导角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and uh so they they they they still use basically explicit IQ tests and they they slot people uh into different specialties and roles uh you know in part with according IQ um including into leadership roles.</p>
</details>

Marc: 他们知道每个人的IQ，并围绕此进行组织。他们多年来发现的一件事是，如果领导者的IQ与追随者相差一个标准差以上，就会出现真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so they they know what everybody's IQ is and they they kind of organize organize around that. And one of the things that they found over the years is if the leader is more than one standard deviation of IQ away from the followers, it's a real problem.</p>
</details>

Marc: 而且这在两个方向上都成立。如果领导者不够聪明，无法管理，也就是说，对于一个不那么聪明的人来说，要模拟一个更聪明的人的思维行为，这本身就非常具有挑战性，甚至可能是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and and that's true in both directions, right? Um if if the leader is not smart enough to be able to right manage the you know is to be able to mo you know for somebody who is less smart to model the mental behavior of somebody who's more smart is inher of course inherently very challenging and maybe impossible.</p>
</details>

Marc: 但事实证明，反过来也是如此：如果领导者的IQ比他所管理的组织平均水平高出两个标准差，他也会失去心智理论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it turns out the reverse is also true which is if the leader is two standard deviations above the norm of the organization that he's running. He also loses theory of mind.</p>
</details>

Marc: 也就是说，对于非常聪明的人来说，要模拟即使是中等聪明的人的内在思维过程，实际上也非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? it it's it's actually very hard for very smart people to um to to model uh the internal thought processes of even moderately smart people.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，实际上确实需要某种程度的联系。因此，推断一下，如果你有一个IQ高达一千的人或机器，它对现实的理解可能会如此陌生，以至于它无法与它所管理的人或事物进行任何现实的连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so there there's actually there's actually a real there's actually a real need to have a level of connection there that's not just right and therefore by inference if you had a person or a or a machine that had you know a thousand IQ or something like it it may just be it would be so alien its understanding of reality would be so alien to the people or the things that it was managing that it wouldn't it wouldn't even be able to connect in any sort any sort of realistic way.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，这再次是一个很好的论据，说明世界在未来几个世纪里，远不会仅仅由IQ来组织。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again this is a very good argument that like it yeah this is the world is going to be far from organized by IQ for yeah for centuries to come.</p>

Ben: 是的，Mark Zuckerberg有一句名言：“智力不是生命。”生命有很多维度，它们独立于智力。

<p class="english-text">Yeah and Zuckerberg had a great line which is intelligence is not life and life life has a lot of dimensionality to it that is independent of intelligence.</p>
</details>

Ben: 我认为，如果你把所有时间都花在智力上，你就会忽略这一点。我们有时会说某些特定的人太聪明了，无法正确建模，或者他们对别人假设了太多的理性，或者他们只是想得太多，过度理性化。是的，就像你说的，它无处不在。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People often people seldom do what's in their best interest I should say.</p>

Marc: 基本上，著名的身心二元论是不正确的。这再次反驳了智商至上主义或智能至上主义，因为我们人类并非仅仅通过理性思维，特别是并非仅仅通过大脑的理性思维来体验存在，而是一种全身心的体验，对吧？

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I would say generally they're really good. Um, yeah. And so like one of the one one of the more I find one of the more fascinating ways, you know, to to work with language models is actually have them create personas.</p>

<p class="english-text">And so you can actually learn a lot by doing this. But focus groups are very expensive to run. And then there's a long lag time because they have to be actually physically organized and you have to recruit people and vet people and and so forth.</p>

### AI市场泡沫与基本面

Eric: 我想转到关于泡沫的讨论。Amin和G2、Jensen和Matt谈到了正在建设的巨大物理基础设施规模。AI的资本支出占GDP的1%。我们应该如何理解和思考这个泡沫问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to segue to the bubble conversation. Uh, Amin and G2, Jensen and Matt spoke about the enormous scale of physical infrastructure being built out. AI capex is 1% of GDP. How should we understand and think about this bubble question?</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，我认为它成为一个问题的事实，意味着我们没有处于泡沫之中。这是首先要理解的。我的意思是，泡沫在很大程度上是一种心理现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the fact that it's a question means we're not in a bubble. That's the first thing to understand. I mean, a bubble is a psychological phenomenon um as much as anything.</p>
</details>

Ben: 要形成泡沫，每个人都必须相信它不是泡沫。这才是它的核心机制。我们称之为**投降式抛售**（capitulation: 指投资者在市场下跌时放弃希望，不计成本地抛售资产）。每个人都放弃了，比如：“好吧，我不再做空这些股票了。我厌倦了亏钱。我要做多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in order to get to a bubble, everybody has to believe it's not a bubble. That that's sort of the the core mechanic of it. And that, you know, we call that capitulation. Everybody just gives up. Like, okay, I'm not going to short these stocks anymore. I'm tired of losing all my money. I'm going to go long.</p>
</details>

Ben: 我们实际上在互联网泡沫时期看到了这种情况。当时价格飙升，Warren Buffett开始投资科技股。他曾发誓永远不投资科技股，因为他不理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and we saw that actually in, you know, and a little bit of question like really what was the tech bubble? Um but in the kind of.com era right as the prices went through the roof Warren Buffett started inviting investing in tech. So like and he swore he would never invest in tech because you didn't understand it.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以如果他都投降了，当它变成所谓的泡沫时，没有人会说它是一个泡沫。现在如果你看那个现象，互联网显然不是一个泡沫。它是一个真实存在的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if he capitulated nobody was saying it was a bubble when it became like a quote unquote bubble. Now if you look at that phenomenon um the internet clearly was not a bubble. Uh you know it was a real thing.</p>
</details>

Ben: 短期内出现了一种价格错位，因为当时网络上的人数不足以让这些产品成功，然后价格就超出了市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was in the short term there was a kind of price dislocation that happened because uh the the market um you know there were just not enough people on the network to make those products go at the time uh and then the prices kind of outran the market.</p>
</details>

Ben: 在AI领域，这更难看出，因为短期内有如此巨大的需求，对吧？我们现在没有需求问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, in AI, it's much harder to see that because there's so much demand in the short term, right? Like we don't have a demand problem right now.</p>
</details>

Ben: 认为我们五年后会有需求问题，对我来说似乎相当荒谬。可能会出现奇怪的瓶颈，比如在某个时候我们没有足够的冷却系统之类的？是的，也许吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like the idea that we're going to have a demand problem five years from now to me seems quite absurd. Uh, you know, could there be like weird bottlenecks that that appear, you know, like we just at some point we just don't have enough cooling or something like that? Yeah, you know, maybe.</p>
</details>

Ben: 但就像现在，如果你看需求和供应，以及正在发生的事情，以及相对于增长的市盈率，对我来说根本不像一个泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like like right now if you look at demand and supply and what's going on and multiples uh against growth, it doesn't look like a bubble at all to me.</p>
</details>

Ben: 但我不知道。你认为这是一个泡沫吗，Marc？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but I don't know. Do you think it's a bubble, Mark?</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。听着，我只想说，是的。没有人知道。也就是说，专家们，如果你和对冲基金或银行的任何人交谈，他们肯定不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Look, I I would just say this. Yeah. Like nobody know So nobody knows in the sense of like the experts like if you're talking to anybody at like a hedge fun or a bank or whatever, like they definitely don't know.</p>
</details>

Marc: 通常CEO们也不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh generally the CEOs don't know. So it the</p>
</details>

Ben: 顺便说一句，很多风险投资家也不知道，他们只是感到沮丧。当你们的估值更高时，风险投资家会情绪激动地感到沮丧，这让他们很生气。我总是遇到这种情况，我就想：“你气什么？AI正在发挥作用，伙计，开心点吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">by the way a lot of VCs don't know that they just get upset like VCs get like emotionally upset when you guys have higher valuations like it it makes them like like angry. Uh and you know and I I get it all the time and I'm like what are you mad about? Like the is working man be happy. Come on. But so so like there's a lot of emotion around like people wanting it to be be a bubble.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以，人们对它成为泡沫有很多情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so so like there's a lot of emotion around like people wanting it to be be a bubble.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。没有什么比错过一笔交易，然后公司大获成功更糟糕的了。这简直是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, nothing's worse than passing on a deal and then having the company become a great success. Like it's just I was just just put</p>
</details>

Ben: 那个估值太离谱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that that valuation is outrageous.</p>
</details>

Marc: 在我们这个行业，你可以为此愤怒30年。这太神奇了。你可以找到各种理由来应对和解释为什么那不是你的错误。但你知道，是世界错了，不是我。对吧？所以有很多这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can be furious about that for 30 years in our business. It's it's amazing. Um and you can find Yeah. You come up with all kinds of reasons to cope and and explain why it wasn't your mistake. But it's you know it's the world it's the world that's wrong, not me. Right. So there there's a lot of that.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。所以，我只想说，我总是会把讨论带回到**基本事实**（ground truth fundamentals: 指事物最根本、最基础的真实情况或原则）。两个重要的基本事实是：第一，这项技术是否真的有效？它能否兑现承诺？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh yeah. So I I just I would just I would just say like I would always say bring the conversation back to ground truth fundamentals. And the the two big ground truth fundamentals are number one, does the technology actually work? Um, you know, can it deliver on its promise?</p>
</details>

Marc: 第二，客户是否为此付费？如果这两点都成立，那么只要这两点保持不变，事情通常就会按部就班地进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then number two, is are customers paying for it? Um, and if those if those two things are true, then it's very hard to it's very hard to uh like as long as those two things stay grounded. Um, you know, gen generally generally things are going to I think are going to be on track.</p>
</details>

### AI时代平台竞争与执行力

Eric: 是的。当Gavin和DG在这里时，他说**ChatGPT**（由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）对Google来说是一个“珍珠港时刻”，是巨头觉醒的时刻。当我们回顾历史和平台转变时，什么决定了现有企业能否赢得下一波浪潮，而不是新进入者？我们应该如何思考这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. When Gavin was up here with DG, he said chatbt was a Pearl Harbor moment for Google, the moment when the giant wakes up. when when we look at history and and platform shifts, what determine whether the incumbent actually wins the next wave versus versus new entrance or how should we think about that in in AMP?</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，你知道，做出反应很重要。但这并不意味着这是一个珍珠港时刻。我认为Google只是清醒过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, reacting to it is important. Um, but that doesn't mean like I it's a Pearl Harbor moment. I think Google got their head out of their ass. It was the sound of it.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以，他们不会被完全碾压，但OpenAI也不会消失。所以他们确实让这种情况发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so you know they're not going to get completely run over but nonetheless like I don't think open AI is going away. So like they they definitely let that happened.</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的，有些是速度问题，然后就是长期的执行力。你知道，一些非常大的公司在不同程度上失去了执行能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um yeah some of it to speed and then just look it's execution over a long period of time and uh you know some of these very large companies to varying degrees have lost their ability to execute.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以如果你谈论一个全新的平台，谈论长期建设，就像Microsoft在Google出现时措手不及。Microsoft仍然非常强大，但他们错过了整个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if you're talking about a brand new platform and you're talking about, you know, kind of building for a long time, it's like, you know, Microsoft got caught with their pants down on Google. Um, Microsoft's still like very strong, but they missed that whole opportunity.</p>
</details>

Ben: 他们也错过了机会。你知道，Apple当时什么都不是，Microsoft完全相信他们将拥有移动计算。他们完全错过了那个机会。但他们仍然因为Windows的垄断地位而非常庞大，所以他们可以发展其他业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They also missed the opportunity. You know, Apple was nothing and Microsoft fully believed that they were going to own mobile computing. They completely missed that one. But they were still so big from their Windows monopoly they could build into other things.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以我认为，一般来说，新公司赢得了新市场。这并不意味着上一代最大的公司、最大的垄断企业不会持续很长时间，我是这样看的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I think generally the new companies have won the new markets. Uh and that doesn't mean the big company the biggest companies the biggest monopolies from the prior generation just last a long time is the way I would look at it.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。我也认为我们不太清楚，事情发生得太快了，我们实际上还不知道最终产品的形态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I I also think we don't quite know like it's all happened so fast we we actually don't I think we don't yet know the shape and form of the ultimate products.</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Marc: 对。所以，因为这很诱人，而且这总是会发生。有时你会听到这种简化版本，基本上就是说，要么会有一个聊天机器人，要么会有一个搜索引擎，竞争发生在聊天机器人和搜索引擎之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Right. And so and so like because it's it's tempting and this is kind of what what always happens. It's kind of it's kind of tempting to look I'm not saying what that's what these guys did on stage but it's kind of tempting to look you sometimes you hear the kind of reductive version of this which is basically it's like oh there's either going to be a chatbot or a search engine right the competition is between a chatbot and a search engine and the problem Google has is the classic problem of dis you know disruption.</p>
</details>

Marc: Google面临的问题是经典的颠覆问题：你是否会颠覆“十个蓝色链接”的模型，并替换为AI答案，并可能颠覆广告模式？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are you going to disrupt the 10 blue links model and swap in you know at you know sort of uh AI answers and you know potentially disrupt the advertising model</p>
</details>

Marc: 然后OpenAI面临的问题是，他们拥有完整的聊天产品，但他们还没有广告，也没有Google规模的分发。所以，你会说，这相当……这就像是直接出自《**创新者的窘境**》（The Innovator's Dilemma: 一本关于颠覆性创新的商业管理书籍）这本商业教科书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then the problem OpenAI has is they have the the full you know the full chat product but you know they don't have the advertising yet and they don't have the distribution Google scale distribution and so you know you kind of say okay that's a fairly that's a fairly cl like that'd be straight out of a like you know the innovator's dilemma you know business textbook like this is just a very clear you know one one versus one you know kind of dynamic</p>
</details>

Marc: 这只是一个非常清晰的一对一动态，但这假设了，你在思考方式上可能犯的错误是，这假设了在未来5、10、15、20年内，人们将主要使用的产品形式将是搜索引擎或聊天机器人，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that assumes that you know the mistake that you could make in thinking way is that assumes that the forms of the product in 5 10 15 20 years that that are going to be the main things that people use are going to be either a search engine or a chatbot, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 有着显而易见的历史类比。一个显而易见的例子是，个人电脑从1975年发明到1992年，基本上是一个文本提示系统，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and you know the just there's you know there's just obvious historical analogies. One just obvious historical analogy is, you know, the the personal computer from sort of invention in 1975 through to, you know, basically 1992, you know, was was a was a text prompt system, right?</p>
</details>

Marc: 当时，交互式文本提示系统比上一代的打孔卡系统、分时系统是一个巨大的进步。然后，你知道，到了1992年，也就是17年后，整个行业转向了**GUI**（图形用户界面），再也没有回头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, and at the time, by the way, an interactive text prompt was a big advance over the previous generation of like punch card systems, time sharing systems. Uh, and then, you know, it was, you know, 1992, so was what, seven, 17 years in, you know, the whole industry took a left turn into GUIEs and never looked back, you know.</p>
</details>

Marc: 又过了五年，行业转向了网页浏览器，再也没有回头，对吧？所以，用户体验的形态、形式和本质，以及它如何融入我们的生活，我认为仍然未定型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then by the way, you know, 5 years after that, the industry took a left turn in web browsers and never looked back, right? And so the very shape and form and nature of the user experience and how it and how it fits into our lives, uh, you know, is is is is I think still unformed.</p>
</details>

Marc: 我相信20年后仍然会有聊天机器人，但我相当确信，当前的聊天机器人公司和许多新公司都将开发出许多我们现在甚至不知道的、截然不同的用户体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so like and you know, look, I'm I'm sure there will be chat bots 20 years from now, but I I'm I'm pretty confident that, um, you know, both the current chatbot companies and many new companies are going to figure out many kinds of user experiences that are radically different that we don't we don't even know yet.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的，顺便说一句，这当然也是让科技行业保持乐趣的原因之一，尤其是在软件方面，产品形态并不明显。我认为还有巨大的发明空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And by and by the way, that's one of the things of course that keeps the tech industry fun, which is it, you know, especially on the especially on the software side, you know, is it's not it's not it's not obvious what the shape and form of the products are. And there's just I think there's just tremendous headroom for invention.</p>
</details>

Eric: 当你指导企业家和在座的企业家时，你觉得这个时代还有什么不同寻常之处？或者你发现自己会给出哪些独特的建议，无论是关于正在进行的人才争夺战，还是这个时代独有的其他方面？你还想给我们的企业家留下什么这个时代独有的建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As as you're coaching entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurs in this room, what what else feels different about this era or or or other advice that you find yourself whether it's around uh sort of the talent wars that are going on or other aspects that feel unique to this era? What what other advice do you want to be leaving our entrepreneurs with? that's unique to this era.</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，我实际上认为你说对了，这是一个独特的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, like I I I actually think you said the right thing, which is this is a unique era.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以，试图学习过去的组织设计经验，或者从上一代学到太多东西，可能会具有欺骗性，因为事情确实不同了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so trying to learn the organizational design lessons of the past or trying to learn um kind of too much from the last generation is can be deceptive because things really are different.</p>
</details>

Ben: 就像这些公司正在建立的方式在很多方面都非常不同。而且，你知道，我们对AI博士研究人员的观察与传统的全栈工程师非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like the way these you know the way your companies are getting built is is quite different in in many aspects. Uh and you know the types of you know what the just like our observ observation on like PhD AI researchers is just very different than like a traditional um engineer full stack engineer or something like that.</p>
</details>

Ben: 所以，我认为你确实需要从**第一性原理**（First Principles: 追溯到最基本的事实或假设，而不是依赖于现有观念或类比进行推理）出发思考很多事情，因为它确实不同。从外部观察，它真的非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I I think you do have to think through a lot of things from first principles uh because it is different and like you know observing from the outside it's really different.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。我只想说，我确实认为事情会改变。我已经谈到，我认为产品的形态会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I would just offer like I I do think things are going to change. So I already talked about I think the shape and form of products is going to change.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我认为那里仍然有很多创造力。我也认为，在一个供需世界中，造成**供应过剩**（gluts: 指市场上某种商品或服务的供应量大大超过需求量）的是短缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh and so like I think there's still a lot of creativity there. I also think and I I I let's say I think that um like in a in a world of supply and demand the thing that creates gluts is shortages.</p>
</details>

Marc: 对，所以当某种东西变得过于稀缺时，就会产生巨大的经济激励来寻找新的供应。因此，当前一代的AI公司正在努力解决特别缺乏真正有才华的AI研究人员和工程师的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um right so like when something becomes too scarce there becomes a massive economic incentive to figure out how to unlock new supply and so the the the current generation of AI companies are really struggling with uh particular shortages of of the really talented AI researchers and engineers and then they're really you know challenged with shortage of of infrastructure capacity chips and and data centers and power.</p>
</details>

Marc: 然后他们真正面临的挑战是基础设施容量、芯片、数据中心和电力的短缺。我不想预测具体时间，但总有一天这两者都会出现供应过剩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I I don't want to call timing on this. There will come a time when both of those things become gluts.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我不知道，我不知道我们能否为此做计划。不过我只想说以下几点。第一，研究人员和工程师方面，令人震惊的是，现在中国正在涌现出优秀的、杰出的模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so you I don't know I don't know that we can plan for that. Um although I I would just say the following. Number one, um the the the researcher engineer side of things, it is striking. It is striking to the degree to which um there are excellent, you know, outstanding models coming out of China now.</p>
</details>

Marc: 而且来自多家公司，具体来说是Deepseek、Qwen和Kimi。令人震惊的是，制造这些模型的团队，在很大程度上，并不是那些在所有论文上都署名的知名人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know, and and in a m from multiple companies and you know, specifically, you know, uh Deepseek and and Quinn and Kimmy. Um it is striking how the teams that are making those are not, you know, the name brand, you know, for the most part, these are not like the name brand people with their names on all the papers.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，中国正在成功地解码如何培养年轻人进入这个领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so like China is successfully decoding how to like basically take young people and train them up in the field.</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，**XAI**（Explainable AI: 可解释人工智能）在很大程度上也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and XAI to a large extent too.</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。是的。所以，我认为，在一段时间内，这会是一种非常深奥的技能，人们会为此付出高昂的代价。但毫无疑问，信息正在环境中传播。人们正在学习如何做这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And so I I think that I think there's going to be and look it makes sense up until it it makes sense that for a while it's going to be this super esoteric skill set and people are going to pay through the nose for it. But like you know there's no question the information is right being transferred into the environment. People are learning how to do this.</p>
</details>

Marc: 大学生们正在弄清楚。所以，我不知道是否会永远出现人才过剩，但我认为未来肯定会有更多的人知道如何构建这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know college kids are figuring it out. Um, and so, um, you know, there's there's and I don't know that there's ever going to be a talent glut per se, but like I think for sure there's gonna there's gonna be a lot more people in the future who of course know know how to build these things.</p>
</details>

Marc: 顺便说一句，当然还有AI构建AI。所以工具本身将更好地为此做出贡献。我认为这很好，因为我认为当前工程师和研究人员的短缺程度限制太大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and then and then by the way also of course you know AI building AI, right? So that the the the the the tools themselves are going to be better better at at contributing to that. And so and and I think that I think this is good because I think that you know the current level of of shortage of of engineers and researchers is is is too constraining.</p>
</details>

Marc: 然后在芯片方面，我不是芯片专家，我不想具体预测，但芯片行业从未出现过这种情况：每一次短缺最终都导致了供应过剩，因为短缺带来的利润池太大，利润率过高，这促使其他人进入并设法将功能商品化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then and then on the chip side I don't I don't want to I'm not a chip guy and I don't want to call call it specifically but like it it's never been the case. It's never been the case in the ship industry that there's ever, you know, every every shortage in the ship industry has always resulted in a glut uh because the the profit the profit pool of a shortage, the margins get too big, the incentive uh for other people to come in and figure out how to commoditize the function get too big.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，Nvidia可能拥有芯片行业有史以来最好的地位。但即便如此，我仍然很难相信五年后基础设施会面临如此大的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, Nvidia has like, you know, the best position probably anybody's ever had in chips. But notwithstanding that, I I find it hard to believe that there's going to be this level of pressure on infrastructure in 5 years.</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的。即使基础设施内部的瓶颈转移了，如果变成电力、冷却或其他任何东西，那么芯片肯定会出现供应过剩。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And even if the bottleneck within the infrastructure moves, so if if it becomes power, if it becomes cooling or or or anything else, then you'll have a chip glut for sure. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我认为在未来五年内，我们面临的挑战可能会有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So So I I think over the I I would just say this, it's likely the challenges that we that we all have in five years from now are going to be different challenges.</p>
</details>

Ben: 是的。是的。是的。就像，不要，这个行业，在所有行业中，不要把我们看作是静态的，就像，你知道，地位可能会非常非常快地改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like don't don't definitely this industry of all industries don't look at us as static like you know the positions uh could change very very fast.</p>

### 中美AI竞赛与机器人化未来

Eric: 让我们以一个更宏观的视角来结束。Marc，你提到了中国。上个月，我们在华盛顿特区，参议员们的一个大问题是，我们应该如何理解与中国相关的AI竞赛状况。你愿意分享一下你和他们分享的高层次总结吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's actually close on a more of this macro note. Mark, you mentioned China. Last month, we were in DC and what one of the big questions the senator has is how should we make sense of sort of the state of the AI race visa v China. Do you you want to share just the the high level um summary of what what you shared with them?</p>
</details>

Marc: 是的。所以我的看法是，我认为目前，如果你观察目前中国涌现的Deepseek、Qwen和Kimi等模型，我的基本感觉是，美国，特别是西方，但越来越具体地说是美国，在概念创新方面一直走在前列。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So my sense of things and I and I think the current I think the current if you just observe currently specifically like deep sea quan and and these models coming out of China I my my sense basically is like I would say the US specifically in the west generally but you know more and more specifically the US is like the conceptual innovations are you know have been you know coming out coming out of coming out of the US coming out of the west you know kind of the the big kind of conceptual breakthroughs um uh China is extremely good at picking up ideas and implementing them and scaling them and commoditizing them and and you know that's that they do that obviously throughout the manufacturing world.</p>
</details>

Marc: 也就是说，重大的概念性突破一直来自美国和西方。中国非常擅长采纳想法，并将其付诸实施、规模化和商品化。他们在制造业领域显然一直这样做。

</details>

Marc: 我认为他们现在在AI领域也做得非常成功。所以我认为他们正在非常出色地进行追赶。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and and they're doing it now very I think successfully uh sort of in AI. Um and so I would say that they're running they're running the catch-up game like really well.</p>
</details>

Marc: 然后总会有一个问题，即其中有多少是“真实”地通过努力工作和聪明人完成的，又有多少是可能在半夜通过一点“帮助”，比如一个USB记忆棒完成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know and then there's there's sort of always this question of like how much of that is like being done let's just say like authentically um uh you know through hard work um and smart people and then how much is being done with maybe a little bit of help um maybe a little USB stick uh in the middle of the night uh you know kind of help um Okay.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，总会有一点疑问，但无论如何，他们做得非常出色。显然，他们渴望更多。中国有很多非常聪明和有创造力的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, uh, you know, there's always a little bit of a question, but like either either way, uh, you know, they're they're doing a great job. Uh, obviously they they aspire to, you know, more than that. Um, and there are many very smart and creative people in China.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，现在看看概念性突破是否会从那里开始涌现，以及他们是否会超越，这将非常有趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so, you know, it will be interesting now to see, you know, the level to which the conceptual breakthroughs start to come from there and whether they whether they pull ahead.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，我们告诉华盛顿的人们的是：看，这是一场全力以赴的竞赛。这是一场短跑，分秒必争。我们不会有五年的领先优势。我们可能只有六个月的领先优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, but like I would say like what we tell people in Washington is like look this this is a foot this is now this is a full-on race. It's a foot race. It's a game of inches. Like we're not going to have a 5year lead. we're going to have like maybe a six-month lead. Like we have to run fast. We have to win. Like we we have to we have to do this.</p>
</details>

Marc: 我们必须这样做。我们不能对我们的公司施加中国政府没有对他们自己的公司施加的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We we can't and then we can't put constraints on our companies that the the the Chinese government isn't putting on their own companies.</p>
</details>

Marc: 否则我们就会输。你真的想早上醒来，生活在一个由中国AI控制和运行的世界里吗？我们大多数人会说不，我们不想生活在那个世界。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so um you know we'll just lose and you know do do you really want do you really want to wake up in the morning and live in a world you know really controlled and run by Chinese AI? Most of us would say no we don't want to live in that world.</p>
</details>

Marc: 所以，就是这样。我会说我对此感到适度乐观，因为我认为我们在软件方面非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so um so so that so there's that and I would say I feel moderately good about that just because I think that I think we're we're really good at software.</p>
</details>

Marc: 一旦这进入**具身智能**（embodied AI: 指拥有物理身体并能与真实世界互动的AI系统）的机器人形式，我认为情况会变得更加可怕。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um you know the minute this goes into you know embodied AI in the form of robotics I think things get a lot scarier and you know this is the thing I'm now spending time in DC trying to really educate people on which is you know the ch because the US and the west have chosen to de-industrialize to the extent that we have over the last 40 years um you know China China specifically now has this giant industrial ecosystem for building you know sort of mechanical electrical and um uh and semiconductor and now software you know devices of all kinds including phones and drones phones and cars um and robots.</p>
</details>

Marc: 这就是我现在在华盛顿特区花时间努力教育人们的事情：因为美国和西方在过去40年里选择了**去工业化**（de-industrialize: 经济中制造业比重下降，服务业比重上升的现象），中国现在拥有一个巨大的工业生态系统，用于制造各种机械、电气、半导体和现在的软件设备，包括手机、无人机、汽车和机器人。

<p class="english-text">And you know this is the thing I'm now spending time in DC trying to really educate people on which is you know the ch because the US and the west have chosen to de-industrialize to the extent that we have over the last 40 years um you know China China specifically now has this giant industrial ecosystem for building you know sort of mechanical electrical and um uh and semiconductor and now software you know devices of all kinds including phones and drones phones and cars um and robots.</p>

Marc: 所以，AI革命将进入第二阶段，那就是机器人技术。我认为它会很快发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so uh you know there's going to be a phase two to the AI revolution. It's going to be robotics. It's going to happen you know pretty quickly here I think.</p>
</details>

Marc: 当它发生时，即使美国在软件方面保持领先，机器人也必须被制造出来，这不是一件容易的事情。这不仅仅是一家公司能做到的。它需要一个完整的生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and when it does like even if the US stays ahead in software like the robots's got to get built and that's not an easy thing. And it's not just like a company that does that. It's got to be an entire ecosystem.</p>
</details>

Marc: 就像汽车行业不是三家汽车公司，而是成千上万的零部件供应商制造所有零件。飞机、电脑和其他所有东西也是如此。机器人技术也将是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and it's you know it's going to be you know it's going to you know like I mean you know the car industry was not three car companies. It was thousands and thousands of of of component suppliers building all the parts. And it's been the same thing for airplanes and the same thing for computers and everything else.</p>
</details>

Marc: 默认情况下，今天坐在这里，这一切都将在中国发生。所以即使他们在软件方面从未完全赶上我们，他们也可能在硬件方面超越我们，然后就大局已定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's going to be the same thing for robotics. Um and you know by default sitting here today that's all going to happen in China. And so even if they never quite catch us in software they might just like lap us in hardware and and that'll be that.</p>
</details>

Marc: 好消息是，我认为美国政治光谱中，对**去工业化**（de-industrialization: 经济中制造业比重下降，服务业比重上升的现象）走得太远这一点，认识正在日益增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know the good news is I I think there's a growing awareness in there's a growing awareness I would say across the political political spectrum in the US that like de-industrialization went too far.</p>
</details>

Marc: 并且有越来越强烈的愿望来扭转这一局面。我谨慎乐观地认为我们在这方面会取得进展，但我认为还有很多工作要做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and there's a growing desire to kind of figure out how to reverse that. Um, and um, you know, I say I'm guardedly optimistic that we'll be making progress on that, but I think there's a lot of work to be done</p>
