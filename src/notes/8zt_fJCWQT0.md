### 市场收盘概览与下跌原因探析

好的，各位，欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》直播。我们有很多公司要讨论，包括亚马逊、苹果、Coinbase、MicroStrategy 和 Roku。显然，亚马逊和苹果是重头戏，我们将在接下来的15分钟内关注并获取它们的业绩报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. We've got Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Micro Strategy, Roku. We've got a lot of companies to talk about. Obviously, Amazon and Apple are the big ones that we will be taking a look at in the next 15 minutes, and we're going to be getting their results.</p>
</details>

除了这些公司，市场在收盘时出现了一些下跌。正如你所见，标普500指数实际上跌破了它在940点位的盘中低点，而今天大部分时间我们都在这个点位上反弹。在过去的一个小时里，我一直在研究，试图找出我们市场下跌的原因。我很乐意在聊天区听听大家的理论。我没有找到任何明确的头条新闻可以解释市场为何不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, besides those companies, you do have a bit of red as we get into the market close. As you can see right here, S&P 500 actually violating that intraday low that it had at 940, uh, that we bounced off of for the majority of the day, right back down 680. You know, I've been trying to think for the past hour. I've been doing some research trying to see what is the reason for why uh we are getting this red and I I'm open to hearing theories in the chat. I have not found a definitive headline that you could chalk up for a explicit reason for why the market is upset.</p>
</details>

我可以给你一些借口，比如我们处于历史高位，人们在获利了结等等，你可以说所有这些，但老实说，我不知道这些是否能公正地解释现状。这很可能意味着并没有真正的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you know I can give you the excuse that we were at all-time highs, people are taking profits, yada yada alos, you could say all those things, but I don't know if any of that does it justice to be honest. Uh which might quite frankly mean there's not really reason.</p>
</details>

### 比特币的历史数据与市场情绪

比特币和以太坊的情况不容乐观。显然，BMR 也不好看。它现在是40美元，我上次看的时候还是46美元。好吧，又跌了两块钱，不是什么大事，对吧？44.86美元，今天下跌了10%。比特币价格略低于107,000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin and Ethereum. Uh, not pretty. Obviously, BMR not pretty either. 40. It was at 46 last time I checked it. Well, it's, you know, another two bucks. Not a big deal, right? 44.86. That one's down 10% on the day. Uh, Bitcoin right below 107.</p>
</details>

我将要告诉你们一个关于比特币的不太乐观的数据。一旦你听到，你可能就无法忘记了，但它确实是事实。上一次比特币在十月份出现3%或更多的跌幅时，接下来的十一月最终下跌了36%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm about to give you guys a stat about Bitcoin. That's not going to be be pretty. So, just realize when you hear it, you're not going to hear it. Uh, you're not going to be able to forget it. But, nonetheless, it is true. Last time we had a red October for a Bitcoin that was negative3% or more. November ended up being negative 36%.</p>
</details>

那发生在2018年，当时是一个完全不同的周期。那时美联储在加息，市场处于熊市，还有中美贸易战等等。这只是那些让你思考的事情之一，好吧，如果比特币本月下跌3%，看起来我们差不多就要这样了。我的意思是，比特币今天就下跌了3%，价格是106,500美元，那么我们就得看看十一月会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that happened that happened back in um that happened back in 2018 and 2018 was a whole different cycle. You had the Fed hiking rates. You had a bare market. You had a China trade war. All that all that stuff. It's just one of those things that makes you think, all right, if Bitcoin is red 3% for the month, which it looks like we're about to be. I mean, we're down 3% for the day on Bitcoin 106.5, then we're going to have to see what happens in November.</p>
</details>

AMD 下跌了2.86%。标普500指数在680点，英伟达下跌了2.362%。我确实抄底买了一点 Meta。我在 Twitter 上发帖，正好在我购买的时候，我拿到的价格是659美元。我们确实看到了反弹，一度高达679美元。这是我在大约上午11:37发布的帖子。所以，这大概是开盘后20分钟，我在659美元又买了一点。虽然股价反弹，仍然高于当日低点，但即便是 Meta，显然也在努力维持其全部势头。现在是665美元，当天仍下跌约11.45%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD right there down 2.86%. S&P 500 680, Nvidia down 2.362. I did buy a little bit of the Meta Dip. I put out a post on Twitter at the exact time that I bought it. 659 was the price that I got. We did get a bounce all the way up to 679. This was the post I put out at around 11:37. So, this was probably like 20 minutes after the market open and I bought a little bit more at 659. Got the bounce still above uh the lows of the day, but nonetheless, even Meta obviously struggling to maintain all of its momentum. 665 right here. Still down about 11.45% on the day.</p>
</details>

有人说“圣诞老人今年需要来访了”。是的，我们今年确实需要圣诞老人来给我们带来一些惊喜。Reddit 下跌7.7%。谷歌在283美元价位上还算坚挺。谷歌现在应该接近300美元，但显然，谷歌从295美元的高点跌到了283美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Santa Claus needs to visit this year. Yes, we are going to need Santa Claus to give us a bit of a visit this year. Reddit down 7.7%. Google's holding on a little bit at 283. Google should be closer to 300 right now, but obviously Google got hit right here uh from its highs at 295 down to 283.</p>
</details>

所以我的问题是，大家为什么认为我们正在经历一些下跌？如果你考虑过，你有什么理由吗？另外，有人抄底了吗？我们买了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that is my question everybody. Why do we think we're uh we're dealing with some of the red? I mean, what is the reason that you have if you've been thinking about it? Also, did anyone buy the dip? What do we get? Did we buy? Did we buy?</p>
</details>

BMR 的价格已经正式低于我的成本价了。我今天没有再买入。再说一次，我持有一个相当大的头寸，有6000股。所以对我来说，要增持，价格必须非常有吸引力才行。这基本上是一个已经建仓完毕的头寸，所以我不是特别急于加仓，而且三周前我在47美元时已经抄底了。所以，对我来说，要再买入，我需要看到价格跌到40美元出头。而且过去一个月我一直在买入更多亚马逊的股票，所以我对亚马逊的财报更感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">BMR is officially below my cost basis. I did not buy more today. Again, I have a sizable position. I have 6,000 shares. So to me it's like for me to add I it really does need to be juicy for me to add. It's it's pretty much a builtout position which is why I'm not super super and I did buy the dip three weeks ago back at 47. So I mean at this point for me to buy I would need to see low 40s for it to actually get there and I've been buying more Amazon over the past month. So that is the one that I'm more interested about going into earnings.</p>
</details>

但不管怎样，我想人们会利用这次下跌的机会。我猜今天可能有人买了 Meta。AMD 下跌2.62%，Palantir 当天基本持平在197美元。然后 Robinhood 显然也受到了冲击，因为比特币和以太坊也下跌了。Rocket Lab 怎么样了？它也跌了吗？下跌了5%。哇，Rocket Lab 下跌了7.3%。我看到很多人提到了 Duolingo、Meta、Novo Nordisk。Duolingo 表现还好吗？不，并不好。Duolingo 跌至260多美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But nonetheless I would imagine people would take advantage of this dip. I would imagine people probably bought Meta today. AMD down 2.62 62 pounder basically flat on the day 197. Then hood obviously getting hit because Bitcoin and Ethereum also getting hit as well. Where is Rocket Lab? Did that get hit? Down 5%. Rocket Lab. Wow. Down 7.3. I see a bunch of Dolingo. Meta. Novo Nordisk. Is Duolingo actually doing okay? No, it's not. 260s for Dolingo.</p>
</details>

也许可以这样说，Chipotle 的下跌以及其他一些消费品公司的疲软，预示着消费者状况存在一些问题，从而引发了一些痛苦。同样，我不想说这就是原因，但我感觉在昨天创下历史新高，英伟达达到五万亿美元市值，一切都在上涨之后，市场需要喘口气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, maybe you could make the argument that the that the Chipotle dip along with some of these other consumer companies signaling some issues around the the state of the consumer is causing some pain. Um, again, I don't want to say this is the reason, but I just feel like after hitting an all-time high yesterday, Nvidia getting to that five trillion level, everything kind of pumping, you know, markets have taken a breather.</p>
</details>

尽管过去几周市场已经有所喘息，但对于加密资产来说，这个十月并非最佳。Twitter 上的加密货币账户都快疯了。有一些加密媒体账户在说，特朗普和 G 的问题解决了，降息了，质押有了，所有的**ETF**（Exchange-Traded Fund: 交易所交易基金）都批准了，特朗普上台了，所有需要的立法都有了。为什么价格还不涨？我也很好奇答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even though they took a breather over the past couple weeks, this has not been the best October for the crypto assets in particular, but nonetheless, this is what we're dealing with. The crypto accounts on Twitter are freaking out. There's like these crypto media accounts that are like, you know, we Trump and G is resolved. You got the rate cuts, you got the staking, you got all the ETFs approved, you got Trump in office, you got all the legislation that's needed. Why isn't it moving? And I'm curious for the answer as well.</p>
</details>

为什么不涨？要么是有人被清算了，要么是市场根本不把比特币看作是对冲通胀的工具。他们不认为这是他们想要接触的资产。黄金今天实际上是上涨的，这很能说明问题，对吧？标普500指数下跌，比特币下跌，黄金上涨1%，回到4000美元以上。白银价格为48.91美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, why isn't it? Someone either is getting liquidated or the market is just not thinking of Bitcoin as a hedge to inflation. They're not thinking of it as an asset they want to get exposure to. Gold is actually up on the day, which is quite telling, right? S&P 500 down, Bitcoin down, gold's up 1% back above 4,000. Silver at 48.91.</p>
</details>

### Meta 资本支出争议

我认为，如果 Meta 没有出现那么大规模的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）未达预期的情况，市场今天的反应可能不会这么糟糕。但不管怎样，Meta 受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if Meta didn't have that massive EPS miss, maybe it wouldn't have been as bad as uh the street had priced it in today. But nonetheless, you got Meta getting ahead.</p>
</details>

我对 Meta 的情况有点困惑。我早上谈到过这个，但我不明白市场怎么能给英伟达一个5万亿美元的市值，却因为 Meta 在**Capex**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出）上花费太多而让其股价下跌10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am a bit confused on Meta. talked about this in the morning, but I don't understand how the market can give Nvidia a $5 trillion market cap and then give Meta a 10% hit because Meta is spending too much on capex.</p>
</details>

这对我来说没有道理。你不能说销售产品并将其推向5万亿美元估值的公司应该上涨，而购买该产品（这也是另一家公司达到5万亿美元估值的原因）的公司却因为花费太多而应该下跌。因为这样你就假设了他们花费太多的后果是不会有**ROI**（Return on Investment: 投资回报率）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason this doesn't make sense to me again, you can't say the company that's selling the product that is pushing it to a $5 trillion valuation should go up, but the company that's buying the product, which is the reason for why that other company is getting to five trillion, should go down because they're spending too much. Because then you're assuming that the reason they're spending too much or that the implication of them spending too much is that there's not going to be an ROI.</p>
</details>

好吧，如果 Meta 的所有这些资本支出都没有投资回报率，他们总有一天会停止支出。如果他们停止支出，那将损害到英伟达，这意味着理论上，如果你如此担心 Meta，你也应该担心英伟达和整个资本支出生态系统。当然，微软和谷歌没有面临同样类型的痛苦，这意味着华尔街更关注 Meta 特别是在浪费钱。但当你看看他们的收入增长时，你会想，什么叫浪费钱？他们同比增长了26%，这比除了英伟达之外的所有其他大型科技公司都快。所以，今天 Meta 发生的事情确实有点令人费解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if that's the case, if there's not going to be an ROI for all this capex spend for Meta, they're going to stop spending at some point. And if they're going to stop spending, that's going to hurt Nvidia, which means theoretically you should be concerned about Nvidia and the overall capex ecosystem if you're so concerned about Meta. Now, granted, Microsoft and Google are not facing that same type of pain, which means the street is more heavily focused on Meta in particular, wasting money. Uh, but then you look at their revenue growth, you're like, well, what do you mean wasting money? like they're up 26% year-over-year. That's faster than every other big tech company outside of Nvidia. So, it's like it is a bit perplexing what's going on with Meta today.</p>
</details>

### 财报前瞻：亚马逊与苹果

但不管怎样，那只股票受到了冲击。亚马逊在收盘前下跌了3%，报223美元。我们在这里做一个“上涨或下跌”的投票，看看大家对亚马逊的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, nonetheless, that one is getting hit. Amazon right there 223 down 3% as we get into the close. Let's do a pump or dump right here and see what we're thinking on Amazon.</p>
</details>

我知道这是聊天室里大多数人都持有的股票之一。我们今天有亚马逊，有苹果，有 MicroStrategy，有 Roku，还有 Coinbase。我还会列出我们有的其他公司。Reddit、Cloudflare，如果你在聊天室里持有这些股票，请告诉我。我们会把它们放到屏幕上。还有 Atlassian、Twilio，这里有一些软件公司的名字。然后还有其他几个行业，比如 Lumen 和 First Solar。所以我们也有一些能源股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know this is the one that most people own in the chat out of the names that we have. We have Amazon today, we have Apple today, we have Micro Strategy, we have Roku, we have Coinbase. Um, I'll pull up the other companies that we have. Reddit, Cloudflare, let me know if you know own any of these in the chat. We're going to put them on the screen. Cloudflare, Reddit, a lot of different consumer companies, tech companies, all different parts of the economy that we'll be looking at. Uh, Atlassen, Twilio. You got some software names in here. Atlassen, Twilio. Um, and then you have other few sectors like Lumen, Lumen, and First Solar. So, we also have some energy right there as well.</p>
</details>

聊天室里60%的人说会上涨。好的，60%的人认为会上涨。亚马逊应该在405美元。所以我们很快就会得到结果，看看会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did most of you guys say in the chat? 60% of people saying pump. Okay, 60% of people saying pump. Amazon should be at 405. So, we're going to get the results relatively soon and we're going to see what ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

另一个市场可能今天下跌的原因是，我们还没有正式的中国协议。昨天特朗普和德桑蒂斯建立了中国谈判框架，但还没有正式签署具体协议。这可能是市场不安的另一个原因。我想，这就是为什么他们说在搞清楚中国问题之前，我们不会走高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other reason the markets might be down today is because we don't have an official China deal. So again we got the China negotiation framework that was established yesterday by Trump and descent but there is not a specific deal officially that has been signed. That could be another reason that the market's upset. Um, and I guess, you know, that's why they're saying we're not going to move higher until we figure out what's going on with China.</p>
</details>

我的想法是，正如我们早上所说，如果**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊网络服务，亚马逊的云计算部门）的增长加速不理想，我认为亚马逊的股价可能会跌破200美元或接近200美元。我认为它可能会突破230美元的区间。隐含波动是6.7%，所以根据他们对AWS的指引，你可能会看到212美元或241美元。我认为一切都取决于AWS，但显然，业务的其他部分也会很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my thoughts and we said this in the morning that I think Amazon can get below 200 or close to 200 if AWS acceleration is not good. I think I think it can blast through the uh the 230s. The implied move is 6.7%. So you're looking at 212 or 241 based on what they do with AWS guidance. I think it all rests on AWS, but obviously the other parts of the business are going to be relevant here.</p>
</details>

好了，各位。我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。这是英伟达财报发布前（大约一个月后）的最后一天。所以，亚马逊和苹果将为第三季度的大型科技公司财报季画上句号。感谢大家的到来。今天是10月30日，星期四。股市现已收盘。

<details>

So, Amazon and Apple is going to be wrapping up big tech earnings for Q3. Thank you everybody for being here. It is Thursday, October 30th. The stock market is now closed.</p>

### 盘后财报速览：亚马逊大获全胜

我们有财报了吗？让我们看看。我们有东西了吗？亚马逊，哦我的天，我们绿了。我们绿了。绿了，宝贝。我们绿了。237美元。哇，收盘前的下跌完全是个假动作。收盘前的下跌完全是个假动作。240美元。我们能到240吗？亚马逊239美元。我马上拿到数据。亚马逊上涨8%。241美元。我们上吧。我们他妈的上吧。我马上拿到数据。这是一个巨大的波动。

<p class="english-text">All right, do we have earnings? Let's see. Do we have something? Amazon goes, oh my goodness, we're green. We're green. Green. Green, baby. We are green. 237. Wow, that dump was such a head fake. That dump was such a head fake into the close. 240. Can we get 240? 239 on Amazon. Let me get the numbers in a second. Amazon up 8%. 241. Let's go. Let's freaking go. I will get the numbers in a second. This is a big move.</p>
</details>

24%的超预期。每股收益1.95美元，预期为1.57美元。营收1800亿美元，预期为1770亿美元。这是一个30亿美元的营收超预期和40美分的每股收益超预期。每股收益同比增长36%。营收同比增长13%。亚马逊242美元，宝贝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">24% beat. 195 versus 157 on EPS. Revenue 180 versus 177. That's a $3 billion beat and a 40 cent beat on EPS. EPS is up 36% year-over-year. Revenue is up 13% year-over-year. Amazon 242, baby.</p>
</details>

### 深入解读亚马逊财报：AWS 增长是关键

>> 亚马逊营收再次超出预期，达到1801.7亿美元，而预期为1778亿美元。但AWS，它的云业务，它的盈利引擎，才是大家关注的焦点。我们看到那里的业绩也超出了预期，达到330亿美元，而预期为324.2亿美元。约翰，真正关键的是，这是一个同比增长20%的增长数字。这甚至高于华尔街的“耳语”预期，后者在18.5%到19%之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> on Amazon for revenue. another beat of 180.17 billion versus 177.8 billion expected. But AWS, it's cloud business, it's profitability engine, that's where everybody was looking. We're looking at a beat there of 33 billion versus 32.42 billion expected. What's really key there, John, is that it's a growth figure of 20% year-over-year. That's higher than even the Whisper estimates from the street, which were in the range of 18 and a half to 19.</p>
</details>

>> 这就是关键数字，宝贝。这就是关键数字。AWS做到了。AWS做到了。华尔街认为会是18.5%。我们做到了20%。这就是关键数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's the number, baby. That is the number. AWS delivered. AWS delivered. Street thought it would come in at 18.5. We came in at 20%. That's the number.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。干得好。干得好，亚马逊。干得好。杰夫·贝索斯挺身而出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. There you go. There you go, Amazon. There you go. Jeff Bezos coming through.</p>
</details>

>> 他们做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> They came through.</p>
</details>

>> 净销售额同比增长13%。AWS同比增长20%，达到330亿美元。北美地区同比增长11%。国际业务增长14%。营业收入174亿美元。这正印证了我昨晚和早些时候所说的。我的意思是，他们正在迈向未来几年内实现20%营业利润率的目标。我认为到2029年底他们会做到这一点，届时这将是一家营业收入2000亿美元、总收入1万亿美元的公司。我的意思是，这次业绩简直是碾压式的。绝对的碾压。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Net sales increased 13% year-over-year. AWS 20% year-over-year to 33 billion. North America 11% year-over-year. International 14%. Operating income 17.4 billion. I mean, this just goes back to what I was saying last night and earlier. I mean, they're on their way to getting a 20% operating margin in the next several years. I think they're going to do it by the time 2029 is over and this will be a 200 billion operating income company off of a trillion revenue. I mean, this was a freaking smash. Absolute smash.</p>
</details>

这里有几句引述非常重要。贾西说AWS的增长速度是我们前所未见的。他说AWS重新加速到同比增长20.2%。他还说，我们的增长速度是自2022年以来从未见过的，这对华尔街来说是天籁之音，尤其是在AWS方面。所以这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, so a couple of uh quotes right here. Yeah, let me let me pull this up. Um really important quotes from this perspective. Jasse says AWS growing at a pace we haven't seen. And guys, we'll get to all the other earnings in a second. Let me just get through this and then we'll get to the other one. Uh Jack says AWS reacelerating to 20.2% year-over-year. He also says we are growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, which is music to the streets ears, especially when it comes to AWS. So that's really important.</p>
</details>

然后来看一些具体数字，营收1800亿对1770亿，AWS 330亿对320亿。营业收入174亿。净利润212亿，同比增长近40%。现金流增长16%。自由现金流近150亿。然后是业绩指引，2060亿到2130亿，这也超出了华尔街的预期。这就是为什么亚马逊股价上涨的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then to get into some specific numbers right here, let me pull this up. Uh revenue 180 versus 177, AWS 33 versus 32. Operating income 17.4. Net income 21.2 that's up almost 40% year-over-year.

### 其他公司财报亮点

好了，我们稍后会再回到亚马逊。让我先看看其他一些数据。MicroStrategy 下跌了8%，我认为这更多是因为比特币。Roku 遭受重创，下跌6%。Coinbase 下跌4%。Cloudflare 下跌2%。Reddit 下跌1%。Atlassian 上涨12%。Twilio 上涨5%。First Solar 下跌7%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, we'll get back to Amazon in a second. Let me get some of these other numbers but Amazon right there not too bad. Nice 8% move after hours. All right, so Micro Strategy that's down 8%. I think that's more because of Bitcoin. We'll get their numbers in a second. Roku nasty hit down 6%. Coinbase down four. Cloudflare down two. Reddit down one. Atlassen's up 12. Twilio's up five for Solar is down seven.</p>
</details>

Coinbase 每股收益超出预期28%，为1.50美元，预期为1.17美元。营收为18.6亿美元，预期为18亿美元。所以，Coinbase 的营收和利润都超出了预期。但股票仍在下跌。加密货币市场今天有点难看，所以你看到了一些痛苦。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Coinbase 28% beast. 150 versus 117. That's a a pretty nice beat by almost 33 cents. 18.6 versus 1.8 billion on revenue. So, you've got Coinbase beating on the top and the bottom line. Stocks still down. Crypto having a little bit of an ugly day. So, you're getting some pain.</p>
</details>

Reddit，哇，每股收益超出预期54%。80美分，预期为52美分。Reddit 刚刚转绿，报222美元。现在每股收益同比增长400%。营收同比增长68%。5.84亿美元对5.49亿美元。对于仅上市一年的 Reddit 来说，这是一个双重超预期，而且每股收益超得非常厉害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reddit, wow, 54% beat on EPS. 80 cents versus 52 cents expected. Reddit just went green. 222. There you go. EPS is now up 400% year-over-year. Revenue is up 68% year-over-year. 5.84 versus 549. You got a double beat and a hell of a beat on EPS for Reddit, which has only been public for a year now. So, pretty incredible for them.</p>
</details>

Twilio 每股收益1.25美元，预期为1.07美元，超出预期17%。营收13亿美元，预期为12.5亿美元，超出预期4%。营收同比增长15%，每股收益同比增长23%。Twilio 盘后上涨6%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Twilio 125 versus 107. That's a beat by 17% on EPS. 1.3 versus 1.25 billion. That's beat by 4% on revenue. Revenue is up 15% year-over-year. EPS is up 23% year-over-year. Twilio's up 6% after hours.</p>
</details>

>> Roku 股价暴跌。尽管每股收益超出预期，为16美分，而分析师普遍预期为9美分。营收12.1亿美元，与预期基本一致。但如果你想找股价下跌的原因之一，该公司的流媒体播放时长为365亿小时，比分析师的预期少了超过10亿小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Roku shares plummeting. This despite earnings beating 16 cents per share versus the 9 cent per share analyst consensus EPS revenues of 1.21 21 billion were right in line with estimates. But if you want to look at the cause or one of the causes of the drop in the stock, the company's streaming hours 36.5 billion. That's over a billion short of analyst estimates.</p>

顺便说一下，Netflix 宣布拆股。1拆10。也许 Meta 需要这样做来挽救局面。Netflix 宣布1拆10的拆股计划。如果你持有 Netflix，恭喜你。

### 苹果财报发布：业绩稳健，指引强劲

>> 苹果公司营收和利润均超出预期。每股收益为1.85美元，高于预期的1.77美元。营收略超预期，为1024.7亿美元，华尔街预期为1022.4亿美元。现在，iPhone 营收未达预期。这可能是我们看到一些负面反应的原因，但销售额仍同比增长了6%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Beats on the top and bottom lines here. Let me go through. There's a lot to unpack here as we see the stock down about 3% on first blush. EPS was a beat. A$185 compared to A$1.77 expected. Revenue, a small beat here, 102.47 billion. Street wanted to see 102.24. Now, iPhone revenues, it was a miss. That might be why we're seeing some negative reaction here, but sales were still up 6% year-on-year.</p>
</details>

>> 服务业务，这当然是苹果的一大增长引擎，同比增长15%，达到287.5亿美元。这是一个小幅度的超预期。中国区销售额下降了约3.12%。然而，这次我们在财报电话会议前得到了一些指引。我刚刚在苹果公园和蒂姆·库克谈过这个。他对这个指引简直是喜笑颜开。他们表示，12月份季度的营收将同比增长10%到12%。而12月份季度的 iPhone 营收，他们现在预测将实现同比两位数的增长，并表示这将是史上最好的销售业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> At 49.03 billion, Street was looking for a little over 50 billion. Now, services, this is of course the big growth engine for Apple. It was up 15% year-on-year to 28.75 billion. That's a slight beat here. Uh Street wanted to see 28.17 billion. And by the way, this is the end of the fiscal year. This is the first time the services business booked over hundred billion in a year. China sales, they were down about three 12%. However, we did get some guidance this time ahead of the earnings call. I was just back there in Apple Park talking to Tim Cook about this. He was literally beaming about this guidance. Uh December quarter revenue, they are saying it's going to be up 10 to 12% yearonear. And iPhone revenue for the December quarter. They're now predicting up double digits yearon year and saying this is going to be the best ever sales.</p>
</details>

>> 伙计们，这可是件大事。苹果的增长率通常在4%到5%之间。所以一个10%到12%的季度增长，实际上是他们过去两年增长率的两倍。你可以理解为什么他会喜笑颜开，如果他们为12月份季度的 iPhone 增长给出了10%的指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Guys, that's a big deal. Apple grows like four to 5%. So a 10 to 12% quarter is a literal double of the last two years of their growth rates. you can understand why he was beaming if they're guiding for 10% growth for the iPhone in the December quarter.</p>
</details>

>> 至于中国市场，蒂姆·库克告诉我，“我们预计本季度中国市场将恢复增长，因为 iPhone 17 系列在那里的受欢迎程度。” 当然，我们还聊到了人工智能。蒂姆·库克告诉我们，Siri 的重大 AI 更新仍在按计划于明年推出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um as far as China, Tim Cook telling me, quote, "We expect China to return to growth this quarter because of the reception of the iPhone there or the iPhone 17 family." And then of course we had to catch up on artificial intelligence. Tim Cook telling us that big AI update to Siri is still on track to launch next year.</p>
</details>

### 分析师点评与市场展望

>> 这只股票会涨的。我的意思是，最终如果你看那个指引，你在中国看到的情况。记住，这个季度只有一周的 iPhone 17 销售。所有人都关注12月，而就我们看到的 iPhone 需求而言，这非常强劲，尤其是在中国。然后你再看看我相信的服务业务，巨大的两位数增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This stock's going to be green. I mean ultimately if you look at that guidance what you're seeing in China. Remember this there was only one week of iPhone 17 the quarter. Everyone's focused on December and that that's very robust in terms of what we're seeing on iPhone demand specifically out of China and then you look at what I believe services you know massive doubledigit growth.</p>
</details>

>> 苹果将加入人工智能的派对，我相信这每股价值75到100美元。如果你现在是投资者，我认为这是敲桌子买入这只股票的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Apple's going to get into the AI party and that I believe is worth $75 to $100 a share. If you're an investor right now, I think it's a pound the table moment for the stock.</p>
</details>

>> 亚马逊、Meta、Alphabet，它们部署的资本量是99%的公司在其生命周期或存在期间永远无法企及的。三四年后谁能与它们竞争？没人。它们将成为一切技术的基石和支柱。它们将成为骨干基础设施。没人能与它们竞争。它们只会变得更大。认为三个月的时间，其中一家公司股价下跌就有什么大不了，有这种心态是疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, they're deploying the amount of capital that 99% of companies will never see in their lives or their existence. Okay? Who is going to compete with them in three or four years from now? Nobody. They are going to be the nuts and bolts of everything technology. They're going to be the backbone infrastructure. Nobody can compete with them. They're just going to get bigger. And to think that three months matters with something selling off with one of these companies is crazy to have that mindset.</p>
</details>

>> 我同意。关于亚马逊的另一件事是，我们一直在谈论这场机器人革命，Jensen（英伟达CEO）也是如此。我不知道除了亚马逊，还有哪家公司在机器人技术方面渗透得更深。如果这能让他们的营业利润率提高哪怕几个百分点，那每个季度都会为他们的净利润增加数百亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I agree. And the other thing about Amazon, we keep talking about this robotics revolution and so does so does Jensen. I mean, I don't know what other company is more infiltrated with robotics other than Amazon. If that increases their operating margins by even a couple percentage points, that's tens of billions of dollars of net income every quarter that they're adding to the bottom line.</p>

### 亚马逊财报电话会议精华

我们在第三季度看到了业务的强劲增长，报告营收为1802亿美元，同比增长12%（不计外汇影响）。营业收入为174亿美元。AWS的增长速度是我们自2022年以来从未见过的，重新加速至同比增长20.2%，这是11个季度以来的最高增长率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We saw strong growth across our business in Q3, and we're reporting 180.2 billion in revenue, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates. Operating income was $17.4 4 billion. I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reacelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters.</p>
</details>

值得记住的是，同比增长百分比是一个相对术语。在1320亿美元的年化运行率基础上实现20%的同比增长，与在明显更小的年收入基础上实现更高的百分比增长率是非常不同的，而我们的竞争对手就是这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth remembering that year-over-year percentage growth is a relative term. It's very different having 20% year-over-year growth on a $132 billion annualized run rate than to have a higher percentage growth rate on a meaningfully smaller annual revenue, which is the case with our competitors.</p>
</details>

我们将继续在产能方面进行非常积极的投资，因为我们看到了需求。我们增加产能的速度有多快，我们就在以多快的速度将其货币化。现在还处于相当早期的阶段，这对客户和AWS来说都是一个非同寻常的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're going to see us continue to be very aggressive investing in capacity because we see the demand. As fast as we're adding capacity right now, we're monetizing it. is still quite early and represents an unusual opportunity for customers in AWS.</p>

Tranium 2 的表现非常好。它已被完全预订。目前它已成为一个数十亿美元的业务，季度收入环比增长了150%。我们预计 Tranium 3 将比 Tranium 2 性能提升约40%。而 Tranium 2 在性价比上已经非常有优势了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">on Tranium 2, it's it's it's really doing well. Um it's fully subscribed on Tranium 2. Uh we have, you know, it's it's a multi-billion dollar business at this point. Uh it grew um 150% quarter over-arter in revenue. I expect tranium 3 will be about 40% better than tranium 2. And trrenium 2 is already very uh advantaged on price performance.</p>

关于杂货业务，我们拥有一个非常庞大的业务。即使不计算 Whole Foods Market 和 Fresh，过去12个月的商品总销售额也超过1000亿美元，这将使我们成为美国前三的杂货商。

我们在本季度的业绩中看到了增长，AWS年化运行率达到1320亿美元，同比增长20%，这是不寻常的，我们势头正劲。我们看到了AI领域和核心基础设施的增长。
