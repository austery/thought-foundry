### 收盘前市场情绪低迷
好的，各位，欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》直播节目。我们有很多公司要讨论，包括亚马逊、苹果、Coinbase、MicroStrategy 和 Roku。显然，亚马逊和苹果是重头戏，我们将在接下来的15分钟内关注并获取它们的业绩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. We've got Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Micro Strategy, Roku. We've got a lot of companies to talk about. Obviously, Amazon and Apple are the big ones that we will be taking a look at in the next 15 minutes, and we're going to be getting their results.</p>
</details>

除了这些公司，市场在收盘时普遍下跌。如你所见，标普500指数实际上跌破了盘中940点的低点，而这个点位在一天中的大部分时间里都起到了支撑作用。过去一个小时我一直在研究，试图找出市场下跌的原因，但没有找到任何明确的头条新闻可以解释市场为何如此不安。我愿意在聊天区听听大家的理论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, besides those companies, you do have a bit of red as we get into the market close. As you can see right here, S&P 500 actually violating that intraday low that it had at 940, uh, that we bounced off of for the majority of the day, right back down 680. You know, I've been trying to think for the past hour. I've been doing some research trying to see what is the reason for why uh we are getting this red and I I'm open to hearing theories in the chat. I have not found a definitive headline that you could chalk up for a explicit reason for why the market is upset.</p>
</details>

当然，我可以给你一些借口，比如我们处于历史高点，人们在获利了结等等，但老实说，我不认为这些能完全解释当前的情况。这很可能意味着并没有一个真正的原因。比特币和以太坊的表现也不尽如人意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you know I can give you the excuse that we were at all-time highs, people are taking profits, yada yada alos, you could say all those things, but I don't know if any of that does it justice to be honest. Uh which might quite frankly mean there's not really reason. Bitcoin and Ethereum. Uh, not pretty.</p>
</details>

关于比特币，我有一个不太乐观的数据要告诉你们。一旦你听了，可能就忘不掉了，但这是事实。上一次比特币在十月份出现超过3%的跌幅时，接下来的十一月最终下跌了36%。那发生在2018年，当时是一个完全不同的周期，美联储在加息，市场处于熊市，还有中美贸易战等各种因素。但这确实会让你思考：如果比特币本月下跌3%，看起来很有可能，那么十一月会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm about to give you guys a stat about Bitcoin. That's not going to be pretty. So, just realize when you hear it, you're not going to hear it. Uh, you're not going to be able to forget it. But, nonetheless, it is true. Last time we had a red October for a Bitcoin that was negative3% or more. November ended up being negative 36%. Now that happened that happened back in um that happened back in 2018 and 2018 was a whole different cycle. You had the Fed hiking rates. You had a bare market. You had a China trade war. All that all that stuff. It's just one of those things that makes you think, all right, if Bitcoin is red 3% for the month, which it looks like we're about to be. I mean, we're down 3% for the day on Bitcoin 106.5, then we're going to have to see what happens in November.</p>
</details>

### 市场下跌的可能原因
我个人认为，市场下跌的故事可以分为两部分。第一，我们昨天创下了历史新高，市场需要稍作喘息，进行一些获利了结。第二，Meta 的财报表现不佳。尽管谷歌和微软表现出色，但 Meta 的失利拖累了市场情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, again, if I had to paint together a story, the story is two parts. Number one, we read alltime highs yesterday. Market's a little upset. Uh not not upset that we're at alltime highs, but in general, you know, you get to alltime highs, need to take a little bit of a breather, take some profits. It seems like that could be what's happening right here. And then the second part of the story is that Meta just didn't have the best earnings. And although Google and Microsoft executed, Meta didn't.</p>
</details>

另一个可能的原因是，我们还没有正式达成中美协议。昨天特朗普和中方建立了谈判框架，但尚未签署具体协议。这可能也是市场感到不安的原因之一，在明确中国问题走向之前，市场可能不会继续上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other reason the markets might be down today is because we don't have an official China deal. So again we got the China negotiation framework that was established yesterday by Trump and descent but there is not a specific deal officially that has been signed. That could be another reason that the market's upset. Um, and I guess, you know, that's why they're saying we're not going to move higher until we figure out what's going on with China.</p>
</details>

### Meta与英伟达的估值悖论
我对 Meta 的情况感到有些困惑。我不理解市场怎么能给予英伟达5万亿美元的市值，却因为 Meta 在**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 用于购买或升级物理资产的资金）上花费过多而让其股价下跌10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, again, Meta right there 670. I am a bit confused on Meta. talked about this in the morning, but I don't understand how the market can give Nvidia a $5 trillion market cap and then give Meta a 10% hit because Meta is spending too much on capex.</p>
</details>

这对我来说没有道理。你不能说销售产品的公司（英伟达）估值应该上涨，而购买该产品、从而推动前者估值达到5万亿美元的公司（Meta）却因为花费太多而应该下跌。这种逻辑假设 Meta 的高额支出不会带来投资回报（ROI）。但如果真是这样，Meta 迟早会停止支出，而这将损害英伟达的利益。理论上，如果你如此担心 Meta，那你也应该担心英伟达和整个资本支出生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason this doesn't make sense to me again, you can't say the company that's selling the product that is pushing it to a $5 trillion valuation should go up, but the company that's buying the product, which is the reason for why that other company is getting to five trillion, should go down because they're spending too much. Because then you're assuming that the reason they're spending too much or that the implication of them spending too much is that there's not going to be an ROI. Well, if that's the case, if there's not going to be an ROI for all this capex spend for Meta, they're going to stop spending at some point. And if they're going to stop spending, that's going to hurt Nvidia, which means theoretically you should be concerned about Nvidia and the overall capex ecosystem if you're so concerned about Meta.</p>
</details>

当然，微软和谷歌没有面临同样的压力，这意味着华尔街更关注 Meta 是否在浪费钱。但看看他们的收入增长，同比增长26%，除了英伟达，比其他任何大型科技公司都快。所以，今天 Meta 的情况确实令人费解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, granted, Microsoft and Google are not facing that same type of pain, which means the street is more heavily focused on Meta in particular, wasting money. Uh, but then you look at their revenue growth, you're like, well, what do you mean wasting money? like they're up 26% year-over-year. That's faster than every other big tech company outside of Nvidia. So, it's like it is a bit perplexing what's going on with Meta today. But, nonetheless, that one is getting hit.</p>
</details>

### 亚马逊财报震撼市场：AWS重回高速增长
市场收盘后，亚马逊的股价立刻变绿了！从223美元飙升至237美元，甚至一度达到241美元。这真是一个巨大的反转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon right there 223 down 3% as we get into the close. ... Amazon goes, oh my goodness, we're green. We're green. Green. Green, baby. We are green. 237. Wow, that dump was such a head fake. That dump was such a head fake into the close. 240. Can we get 240? 239 on Amazon. Let me get the numbers in a second. Amazon up 8%. 241. Let's go.</p>
</details>

亚马逊的**每股收益**（EPS: Earnings Per Share）为1.95美元，而预期为1.57美元，超出24%。营收达到1800亿美元，高于预期的1770亿美元，超出30亿美元。EPS同比增长36%，营收同比增长13%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">24% beat. 195 versus 157 on EPS. Revenue 180 versus 177. That's a $3 billion beat and a 40 cent beat on EPS. EPS is up 36% year-over-year. Revenue is up 13% year-over-year. Amazon 242, baby.</p>
</details>

> **Sam:** 我们太需要这个了。收盘前看起来很吓人。**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊的云计算平台）的营收也超出了预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We needed that one. We really needed that stuff, dude. I needed that. I needed that. Um, it looked pretty scary coming to close. I was like, "Oh, shoot. Oh, shoot. Hold on." AWS revenue beat on the top line. Hold on. I'm trying to pull up AWS growth.</p>
</details>

> **Mackenzie Sagalas:** 关键数据在于 AWS，它的云业务和盈利引擎。营收达到330亿美元，超过预期的324.2亿美元。更关键的是，同比增长率达到了20%，这甚至高于华尔街18.5%到19%的普遍预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But AWS, it's cloud business, it's profitability engine, that's where everybody was looking. We're looking at a beat there of 33 billion versus 32.42 billion expected. What's really key there, John, is that it's a growth figure of 20% year-over-year. That's higher than even the Whisper estimates from the street, which were in the range of 18 and a half to 19.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 这就是关键数字！AWS 做到了！华尔街原以为会是18.5%，结果是20%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's the number, baby. That is the number. AWS delivered. AWS delivered. Street thought it would come in at 18.5. We came in at 20%. That's the number.</p>
</details>

亚马逊CEO安迪·贾西 (Andy Jassy) 表示：“AWS 的增长速度是我们自2022年以来从未见过的。” 这对华尔街来说是天籁之音。此外，公司对第四季度的营收指引在2060亿至2130亿美元之间，也高于市场预期。这就是亚马逊股价大涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jasse says AWS growing at a pace we haven't seen. ... Jack says AWS reacelerating to 20.2% year-over-year. He also says we are growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, which is music to the streets ears, especially when it comes to AWS. So that's really important. And then to get into some specific numbers right here, let me pull this up. Uh revenue 180 versus 177, AWS 33 versus 32. Operating income 17.4. Net income 21.2 that's up almost 40% year-over-year. Cash flows up 16%. free cash flows almost 15 billion and then guidance 206 to 213 that is ahead of the street expectation as well and that is why aid Amazon is green.</p>

### 苹果业绩稳健，强劲指引推动股价创新高
苹果公司公布财报后，股价先是下跌，从270美元跌至265美元左右。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apple. We should be getting results. We're down. We're down. She's going red kind of. 270 to 265. That's not that crazy.</p>
</details>

> **记者:** 苹果的EPS和营收均超出预期。EPS为1.85美元，高于预期的1.77美元；营收为1024.7亿美元，略高于预期的1022.4亿美元。然而，iPhone营收未达预期，为490.3亿美元，低于市场预期的500多亿美元，这可能是股价初步下跌的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Beats on the top and bottom lines here. Let me go through. There's a lot to unpack here as we see the stock down about 3% on first blush. EPS was a beat. A$185 compared to A$1.77 expected. Revenue, a small beat here, 102.47 billion. Street wanted to see 102.24. Now, iPhone revenues, it was a miss. That might be why we're seeing some negative reaction here, but sales were still up 6% year-on-year.</p>
</details>

> **记者:** 不过，服务业务收入同比增长15%，达到287.5亿美元，略超预期。更重要的是，苹果发布了12月季度的营收指引，预计将同比增长10%到12%。iPhone营收预计将实现两位数的同比增长。这对苹果来说是个大新闻，因为他们通常的增长率在4%到5%之间，10%到12%的指引几乎是过去两年增长率的两倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, services, this is of course the big growth engine for Apple. It was up 15% year-on-year to 28.75 billion. That's a slight beat here. ... we did get some guidance this time ahead of the earnings call. ... December quarter revenue, they are saying it's going to be up 10 to 12% yearonear. And iPhone revenue for the December quarter. They're now predicting up double digits yearon year and saying this is going to be the best ever sales. Guys, that's a big deal. Apple grows like four to 5%. So a 10 to 12% quarter is a literal double of the last two years of their growth rates.</p>
</details>

> **记者:** 蒂姆·库克 (Tim Cook) 还表示，预计本季度中国市场将恢复增长。关于人工智能，他确认对 Siri 的重大AI更新仍在按计划于明年推出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> As far as China, Tim Cook telling me, quote, "We expect China to return to growth this quarter because of the reception of the iPhone there or the iPhone 17 family." And then of course we had to catch up on artificial intelligence. Tim Cook telling us that big AI update to Siri is still on track to launch next year.</p>
</details>

在强劲指引的推动下，苹果股价逆转走势，一路上涨，甚至突破280美元，创下历史新高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> to Sam's point, it looks like that super cycle might finally start to get priced in and that's why Apple is making a move. Apple right there goes green. 273 from 263 to 273.</p>
</details>

### 其他关键公司财报概览
*   **Coinbase:** 营收和EPS均超预期，但股价受加密货币市场整体下跌影响而走低。不过，盘后有消息称 Coinbase 购买了3亿美元的比特币，这又推动了股价回升。
*   **Reddit:** EPS大幅超出预期54%，营收也超出预期。但股价经历了剧烈波动，从大涨到暴跌再到回升。
*   **Roku:** 尽管盈利超预期，但其流媒体播放时长未达分析师预期，导致股价暴跌。
*   **Netflix:** 宣布进行10比1的股票拆分，股价上涨。
*   **MicroStrategy:** EPS未达预期，但营收超出预期。公司在财报中预测，年底比特币价格将达到15万美元，这一指引使其股价在盘后有所回升。
*   **Cloudflare, Atlassian, Twilio:** 这几家软件公司财报均表现良好，股价盘后上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so Micro Strategy that's down 8%. I think that's more because of Bitcoin. We'll get their numbers in a second. Roku nasty hit down 6%. Coinbase down four. Cloudflare down two. Reddit down one. Atlassen's up 12. Twilio's up five for Solar is down seven. ... Coinbase 28% beast. 150 versus 117. ... you've got Coinbase beating on the top and the bottom line. Stocks still down. ... Reddit, wow, 54% beat on EPS. 80 cents versus 52 cents expected. ... You got a double beat and a hell of a beat on EPS for Reddit. ... Twilio 125 versus 107. That's a beat by 17% on EPS. ... Roku shares plummeting. This despite earnings beating ... the company's streaming hours 36.5 billion. That's over a billion short of analyst estimates. ... Netflix announces a split. ... 10 for one. ... Micro Strategy, they they they have Fazby accounting now. So, it's a it's a it's kind of a different way to think of their earnings. ... the reason Micro Strategy is moving, guys, is because they just said that they are assuming Bitcoin will be 150 by end of year.</p>

### 分析师解读：科技巨头引领市场信心
> **Dan Ives:** 这支股票（苹果）将会变绿。最终，如果你看那份指引，以及你在中国看到的情况……每个人都关注12月份，这在iPhone需求方面非常强劲，尤其是在中国。我认为苹果将加入AI派对，这价值每股75到100美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This stock's going to be green. I mean ultimately if you look at that guidance what you're seeing in China. ... Everyone's focused on December and that that's very robust in terms of what we're seeing on iPhone demand specifically out of China ... Apple's going to get into the AI party and that I believe is worth $75 to $100 a share.</p>
</details>

> **Sam:** 这些大型科技公司正在部署的资本量是99%的公司一生都无法企及的。三四年后谁能与它们竞争？没人。它们将成为一切技术的支柱和基础设施。它们只会变得更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, they're deploying the amount of capital that 99% of companies will never see in their lives or their existence. Okay? Who is going to compete with them in three or four years from now? Nobody. They are going to be the nuts and bolts of everything technology. They're going to be the backbone infrastructure. Nobody can compete with them. They're just going to get bigger.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 今天的市场走势真是个假象。Meta的创伤后应激障碍，然后你看到亚马逊下跌3%。每个人都在想，我们会听到什么坏消息？结果完全相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, fake out feels like an understatement. The the the meta PTSD and then you see Amazon fall 3%. Everyone was feeling all right, what are we getting ready to hear? And then completely opposite direction.</p>

### 亚马逊财报电话会议精华
在随后的财报电话会议上，CEO安迪·贾西详细阐述了公司的强劲表现。

**关于AWS的增长：**
“AWS正以我们自2022年以来未曾见过的速度增长，重新加速至20.2%的同比增长……积压订单在第三季度末增至2000亿美元，这还不包括10月份几个尚未宣布的新交易，这些交易的总额超过了我们整个第三季度的交易量。AWS正在获得动力。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll start with AWS. AWS is growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022, reacelerating to 20.2% year-over-year, our largest growth rate in 11 quarters. ... Backlog grew to $200 billion by Q3 quarter end and doesn't include several unannounced new deals in October, which together are more than our total deal volume for all of Q3. AWS is gaining momentum.</p>
</details>

**关于自研芯片Tranium：**
“Tranium 2的表现非常好，已经被完全预订。它目前是一项数十亿美元的业务，季度收入环比增长了150%……我们预计Tranium 3将比Tranium 2性能提升约40%，而Tranium 2在性价比上已经非常有优势。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as I mentioned on Tranium 2, it's it's it's really doing well. Um it's fully subscribed on Tranium 2. Uh we have, you know, it's it's a multi-billion dollar business at this point. Uh it grew um 150% quarter over-arter in revenue. ... I expect tranium 3 will be about 40% better than tranium 2. And trrenium 2 is already very uh advantaged on price performance.</p>
</details>

**关于资本支出和产能：**
“我们在过去12个月里增加了超过3.8吉瓦的电力容量……我们有望在2027年底前再次将总容量翻倍……我们预计2025年全年的现金资本支出约为1250亿美元，并预计该金额将在2026年增加。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we've been focused on accelerating capacity the last several months, adding more than 3.8 gawatts of power in the past 12 months... and we're on track to double again by 2027. ... Looking ahead, we expect our fullear cash capex to be approximately $125 billion in 2025, and we expect that amount will increase in 2026.</p>
</details>

**关于裁员：**
“几天前我们宣布的（裁员）并非真正出于财务或AI驱动……它关乎文化。当你像我们一样连续几年快速增长时……最终会产生比以前更多的层级。这可能会削弱一线员工的主人翁意识……并导致行动变慢。作为领导团队，我们致力于像世界上最大的初创公司一样运作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven and it's not even really AI driven. ... It's it it really it's culture and if you grow uh as fast as we did for several years... you end up with a lot more layers. And when that happens, you know, sometimes without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work... And it and it can lead to slowing you down. And as a leadership team, we are committed to operating like the world's largest startup.</p>
