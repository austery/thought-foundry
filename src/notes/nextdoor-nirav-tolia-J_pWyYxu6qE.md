### 创业之路与Nextdoor的回归

I am Nirav Tolia, the CEO and co-founder of Nextdoor and someone who has been fortunate to work in technology for the last 30 years in Silicon Valley.

我是Nirav Tolia，**Nextdoor** (一个专注于邻里社交的社交媒体平台) 的首席执行官兼联合创始人，很幸运能在硅谷从事科技工作30年。

I am the son of two incredible Indian immigrants who came to America, truly lived the American dream.

我是两位杰出的印度移民的儿子，他们来到美国，真正实现了美国梦。

The things that I did naturally were more entrepreneurial; I had a car wash, I had a number of other neighborhood businesses that made me feel like I could create something out of nothing.

我天生就更具创业精神；我曾经营一家洗车店，还有一些其他社区生意，这让我觉得自己可以白手起家创造一些东西。

Nextdoor is now 15 years old, but ultimately I wasn't growing with the company.

Nextdoor现在已经成立15年了，但最终我并没有与公司共同成长。

The things that I was doing as a CEO were too similar to what we needed in the early days and not tuned or specific enough to what we needed to get to the next level.

作为首席执行官，我所做的事情与公司早期所需过于相似，未能充分调整或具体化以满足公司迈向更高阶段的需求。

And so the decision was made, and it was a very hard decision, that we needed new leadership, and I left; for five and a half years I was still linked to Nextdoor and I still loved the company, but I was on the sidelines, not on the field.

因此，我们做出了一个非常艰难的决定：我们需要新的领导层，我离开了；在接下来的五年半里，我仍然与Nextdoor保持联系，我仍然热爱这家公司，但我只是一个旁观者，而不是参与者。

When I left Nextdoor the first time, I spent five and a half years primarily being an investor.

我第一次离开Nextdoor后，主要做了五年半的投资者。

One of the really fun things I was able to do as an investor is to go on this popular show, Shark Tank; I went on as a shark.

作为一名投资者，我能做的其中一件非常有趣的事情就是参加热门节目《**创智赢家** (Shark Tank: 一档创业者向投资人推销项目的真人秀节目)》；我以“鲨鱼”的身份参与了节目。

But when I went on, I realized something really interesting: I loved being a shark and I admired my fellow sharks; they were all very successful business people.

但当我参与其中时，我意识到了一件非常有趣的事情：我喜欢扮演“鲨鱼”的角色，我也很欣赏我的同行“鲨鱼”们；他们都是非常成功的商人。

But my true admiration was for the entrepreneurs because when they walked in to pitch us on live television, the pressure they were feeling, the anxiety, the nervousness, I know what that feels like because I felt it.

但我真正钦佩的是那些创业者，因为当他们走进直播电视节目向我们推销时，他们所感受到的压力、焦虑和紧张，我感同身受，因为我也曾经历过。

And so my empathy for those people and what they were doing, it was very different than just being an investor.

因此，我对那些创业者及其所做事情的同理心，与仅仅作为一名投资者是截然不同的。

And ultimately, I came back to Nextdoor because I loved investing, but I am an entrepreneur.

最终，我回到了Nextdoor，因为我热爱投资，但我更是一名创业者。

### Nextdoor的使命与社区建设

Even today, the thing that I care most about is having positive impact on the world.

即使是今天，我最关心的仍然是对世界产生积极影响。

It's not easy to work long hours; there are lots of sacrifices; I want to feel like I had a positive impact on the world, and my way of doing that is by building technology companies.

长时间工作并不容易，需要做出很多牺牲；我希望自己能对世界产生积极影响，而我实现这一点的方式就是创办科技公司。

Nextdoor is the essential neighborhood application; it's a social media service that helps you get closer with the people around you, that makes your house feel like a home and makes you come together with your neighbors to build a stronger, safer, and happier local community.

Nextdoor是一款不可或缺的社区应用程序；它是一种社交媒体服务，帮助你与身边的人建立更紧密的联系，让你的房子感觉像家，让你与邻居们团结起来，共同建设一个更强大、更安全、更幸福的本地社区。

One of the big changes with this version of Nextdoor, the Next Nextdoor that we have recently released, is that we've integrated local news into the service.

Nextdoor这个新版本，也就是我们最近发布的“下一代Nextdoor”，其中一个重大变化是我们已将本地新闻整合到服务中。

The way that neighbors learned about things that were going on in their neighborhoods, even predating the internet, was through local newspapers.

邻居们了解社区里发生事情的方式，甚至在互联网出现之前，就是通过当地报纸。

We're live in over 11 countries around the world; as a public company, we are also generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.

我们已在全球超过11个国家上线；作为一家上市公司，我们也在创造数亿美元的收入。

But I think the important thing is every single day we know that neighbors use Nextdoor to make their local communities stronger.

但我认为重要的是，我们知道邻居们每天都在使用Nextdoor来让他们的本地社区变得更强大。

That was our dream when we started the company and we know it's happening today, which is so fulfilling for us.

这是我们创办公司时的梦想，我们知道它今天正在实现，这让我们感到非常满足。

### 雅虎的启示：用户价值至上

I was very lucky to be an undergrad at Stanford and through that process I heard of a young company that had just been started by two other Stanford students.

我很幸运能在斯坦福大学读本科，在此过程中，我听说了一家由另外两名斯坦福学生刚创办的年轻公司。

The company was called Yahoo; the year was 1995, 1996, and the internet was just beginning to boom.

这家公司叫做**雅虎** (Yahoo: 曾是全球领先的互联网服务提供商)；那是1995、1996年，互联网正开始蓬勃发展。

Because of my relationships at Stanford, I was able to go and work at Yahoo as my first job as one of the first 100 employees, and it was the lucky break of a lifetime.

由于我在斯坦福的关系，我得以进入雅虎工作，作为前100名员工之一，这是我人生中的第一份工作，也是一次千载难逢的幸运机会。

Being an early employee at Yahoo was like winning a ticket in a lottery.

成为雅虎的早期员工就像中了彩票一样。

Yahoo in the mid-90s was the hottest internet company; it was the product that not only was a shining beacon of innovation in this new field, this new dot-era, it was a product that was beloved by users.

90年代中期，雅虎是最热门的互联网公司；它不仅是这个新兴领域、这个**“点时代”** (dot-era: 指互联网早期，以“.com”域名为代表的互联网公司兴起时期) 的创新典范，也是深受用户喜爱的产品。

I would wear my Yahoo T-shirt and walk down University Avenue in Palo Alto, California, and so many people would come up to me and tell me how much they loved using Yahoo.

我常常穿着雅虎T恤走在加州帕洛阿尔托的大学大道上，很多人会走过来告诉我他们有多喜欢使用雅虎。

The first thing I would say about Yahoo is it was a very humble place; even amidst its success, it was a very flat organization.

关于雅虎，我想说的第一点是它是一个非常谦逊的地方；即使在它取得成功之时，它也是一个非常扁平化的组织。

And I remember the first week at Yahoo, I joined, one of the most junior people, one of the youngest people, a real nobody at the company.

我记得在雅虎的第一周，我加入了公司，当时我是最资深的人之一，也是最年轻的人之一，在公司里真的微不足道。

And the car that I was driving, the battery died and it couldn't start.

我开的车电瓶没电了，启动不了。

Guess who gave me a jump from his car? One of the founders of Yahoo, who's gone on to become a billionaire and an internet celebrity.

猜猜是谁用他的车帮我启动的？是雅虎的创始人之一，他后来成为了亿万富翁和互联网名人。

But that tells you about the humility of the place, and it wasn't just in helping a new employee with a dead car battery; it was in everything around building the company.

但这说明了那个地方的谦逊，它不仅仅体现在帮助一个新员工解决汽车电瓶没电的问题上；它体现在公司建设的方方面面。

No task was too big, no task was too small; it was not a hierarchical place; it was a place where the quality of ideas and the value of hard work is what led to success.

没有任务太大，也没有任务太小；那不是一个等级森严的地方；那是一个以思想质量和勤奋工作价值为成功导向的地方。

Yahoo was a place during those days where almost every day that I came to work, the metrics were better because as great as Yahoo was as a company, it was caught in a revolution that was even bigger than any single company.

那些日子里，雅虎是一个我几乎每天上班都能看到各项指标变得更好的地方，因为尽管雅虎是一家伟大的公司，但它正处于一场比任何单一公司都更宏大的变革之中。

And that was the **dotcom revolution** (互联网泡沫: 20世纪90年代末互联网公司股价飙升，随后迅速下跌的时期); and so we hear this expression, 'in a rising tide, all boats rise'.

那就是**互联网泡沫** (dotcom revolution: 20世纪90年代末互联网公司股价飙升，随后迅速下跌的时期)；所以我们听到这样一句话：“水涨船高”。

Well, Yahoo was one of the biggest and best boats, but it was the beneficiary of that tide.

雅虎是其中最大最好的船只之一，但它也是那股浪潮的受益者。

And so over a three-year period at Yahoo, I saw the company grow from less than 100 employees to over 10,000.

因此，在雅虎的三年时间里，我看到公司从不到100名员工增长到超过10,000名。

When I look back at the lessons I learned at Yahoo, particularly about building consumer technology products, there's one that stands above all the others, and that is user value first.

当我回顾在雅虎学到的经验，特别是关于构建消费者科技产品的经验时，有一点凌驾于所有其他之上，那就是用户价值优先。

Google, which came after Yahoo, has a saying, one of its core principles: 'Follow the user first and all else will take care of itself'.

在雅虎之后出现的谷歌，有一句格言，也是其核心原则之一：“先关注用户，其他一切自会水到渠成。”

That is the way Yahoo operated and that is what I want Nextdoor to be like.

这就是雅虎的运作方式，这也是我希望Nextdoor能够效仿的。

### 创业的冲动与早期挑战

You may ask why did I leave? Why did I only spend three years at Yahoo?

你可能会问我为什么离开？为什么我只在雅虎待了三年？

Well, the truth is even though I loved being there, something was missing, and that thing that was missing is my direct influence on the impact the company was having.

事实是，尽管我喜欢在那里工作，但总觉得少了点什么，缺少的是我对公司产生影响的直接作用。

So after three amazing years at Yahoo, I left to start my own company.

因此，在雅虎度过了三年精彩的时光后，我离开了，去创办自己的公司。

And I remember my goodbye party at Yahoo; I was lucky enough to have Jerry Yang, one of the founders, there.

我还记得我在雅虎的告别派对；我很幸运，创始人之一的杨致远也在场。

And he came over to me towards the end of the party and he said, "You know, I wish you so much luck. I'm excited for you, but I'm curious. Why are you leaving Yahoo? No one is leaving this company right now."

他在派对快结束时走到我身边，说：“你知道，我祝你一切顺利。我为你感到高兴，但我很好奇。你为什么要离开雅虎？现在没有人会离开这家公司。”

And I said, 'Jerry, when I think about this amazing thing you've built, I want to do the same thing'.

我说：“杨致远，当我想到你所创造的这个了不起的事业时，我也想做同样的事情。”

And he kind of looked at me with a puzzled look and I said, 'You understand that, right, Jerry?'

他带着困惑的表情看着我，我说：“你明白我的意思，对吧，杨致远？”

And he said, "Yes, I do understand it, but do you have any idea how hard it is to build a company?"

他说：“是的，我明白，但你知道创办一家公司有多难吗？”

And the truth is, I didn't, and one of the amazing things about entrepreneurs is they don't know how difficult it's going to be when they start a company.

事实上，我并不知道，而创业者最了不起的一点就是，他们在创办公司时并不知道会遇到多大的困难。

If they did, they might not begin in the first place.

如果他们知道，可能一开始就不会着手。

But I went off, I started my own company, lots of highs and lows, ultimately a pretty good outcome.

但我还是离开了，创办了自己的公司，经历了许多高潮和低谷，最终取得了不错的结果。

I went on to start multiple other companies; I became an investor, but all of it was because I wanted to be an entrepreneur because I felt that was the best way to have impact.

我后来又创办了几家公司；我成为了一名投资者，但所有这一切都是因为我想成为一名创业者，因为我觉得那是产生影响的最佳方式。

### Nextdoor的诞生与社区连接的挑战

Almost 30% of Americans could not name a single neighbor by name; so those bonds in the local community, they had been eroding.

将近30%的美国人叫不出一个邻居的名字；因此，本地社区的这些纽带一直在 H 弱。

We found a book called Bowling Alone by Robert Putnam, the chair of the sociology department at Harvard.

我们发现了一本由哈佛大学社会学系主任罗伯特·帕特南所著的《**独自打保龄球** (Bowling Alone: 一本探讨美国社会资本衰退的著名社会学著作)》。

And the book was about the sport bowling and its evolution in America and how the popularity of the sport has not changed, but people no longer bowl in bowling leagues; they bowl alone.

这本书讲述了保龄球这项运动及其在美国的演变，以及这项运动的受欢迎程度并未改变，但人们不再参加保龄球联赛，而是独自打保龄球。

And it was a symbol of the decline and erosion of community.

它象征着社区的衰落和侵蚀。

So we started to look around in our industry, in our lives, in the world in general, and here's what we noticed.

于是我们开始审视我们的行业、我们的生活以及整个世界，我们注意到了一些事情。

We noticed the emergence of social media services; this was the summer of 2010; Facebook was starting to really ascend, LinkedIn was starting to ascend, Twitter, now called X, was starting to ascend.

我们注意到社交媒体服务的兴起；那是2010年夏天；Facebook开始真正崛起，LinkedIn开始崛起，Twitter（现在叫X）也开始崛起。

And so, there was a social platform connecting you to your friends, connecting you to your business colleagues, connecting you to people that you found interesting.

因此，当时已经有了连接你与朋友、连接你与商业同事、连接你与你觉得有趣的人的社交平台。

There wasn't a social platform though that was connecting you to the physical world in which you lived, your neighborhood.

然而，当时并没有一个社交平台能将你与你所居住的物理世界，也就是你的社区连接起来。

And so as we moved from what was happening in the industry to what was happening in our own lives, we were getting a little older, we were getting more rooted in our neighborhoods, we were less likely to move away, we were more likely to invest in the place that we'd chosen to live.

因此，当我们从行业发展转向我们自身生活时，我们年纪渐长，在社区中扎根更深，搬走的可能性更小，更愿意投资我们选择居住的地方。

But technology wasn't helping us make those investments, the same way Facebook was making it seamless for us to communicate with friends that we hadn't seen in years.

但科技并没有帮助我们进行这些投入，就像Facebook让我们与多年未见的朋友无缝交流一样。

There was no technology service that was making it easy to speak to the person next door.

没有一项技术服务能让我们轻松与隔壁邻居交流。

Now we don't rely on that village of the neighborhood where it does take a village; we don't have it anymore.

现在我们不再依赖那种“众人拾柴火焰高”的社区模式；我们已经没有了。

All of those things compelled us, really inspired us to think, can we create a social media service that's focused on what we believe is one of the most important parts of our lives, and that is our local community.

所有这些都促使我们，真正激励我们思考，我们能否创建一个社交媒体服务，专注于我们认为生活中最重要的部分之一，那就是我们的本地社区。

The idea was the neighborhood is one of the most important communities of them all.

我们的想法是，邻里是所有社区中最重要的一个。

And ironically, while technology may have caused us to retreat away from our neighborhoods and onto our screens, can we use those same screens to bring us back to our neighborhoods? And that was the original vision.

讽刺的是，虽然科技可能导致我们远离社区，沉浸在屏幕中，但我们能否利用这些屏幕将我们带回社区？这就是最初的愿景。

We wanted to hear from actual neighbors what they wanted in a technology tool to make their neighborhood stronger, safer, and happier.

我们想听听真实的邻居们，他们希望科技工具能提供什么，来让他们的社区更强大、更安全、更幸福。

And so before we wrote a line of code, before we designed a single interface, before we thought about the business model, we simply drew a mockup on a piece of paper and we showed it to neighbors and we let them respond.

因此，在我们写一行代码之前，在我们设计一个界面之前，在我们考虑商业模式之前，我们只是在一张纸上画了一个模型，展示给邻居们看，并让他们给出反馈。

And very quickly, we found out that there were no existing technology tools that were bringing people together locally.

很快，我们发现当时并没有现成的科技工具能够将人们在本地连接起来。

We could use technology to speak to people on the other side of the world in real time, but there was no technology tool that would introduce us to the person right across the street.

我们可以利用科技与远在世界另一端的人实时对话，但却没有一个科技工具能把我们介绍给街对面的那个人。

And so instantly we knew there was an opportunity.

所以我们立刻就知道这里存在一个机会。

But the problem is when we started the company, the need for Nextdoor existed because people didn't know their neighbors.

但问题是，当我们创办公司时，Nextdoor之所以有需求，正是因为人们不认识他们的邻居。

So if you don't know your neighbors, how do you invite them to a service? And this was a paradoxical challenge for us from the very beginning.

所以如果你不认识你的邻居，你如何邀请他们使用一项服务呢？这从一开始就是我们面临的一个矛盾挑战。

The value we were looking to create was squarely in the way of us being able to build that value in the first place.

我们试图创造的价值，恰恰阻碍了我们最初建立这种价值的能力。

And so we had to invest in really understanding the manual ways to get the first few people in the neighborhood and make sure they were the right few people.

因此，我们必须投入精力去真正理解那些手动方式，以便将社区里的第一批人吸引进来，并确保他们是合适的人。

And then we had to invest in offline mechanisms, flyers, postcards.

然后我们不得不投入到线下机制中，比如传单、明信片。

People used to laugh at us and say, 'Let me get this straight. You're using real paper, like dead tree paper, to advertise your service'.

人们过去常常嘲笑我们说：“我没听错吧？你们竟然用真的纸，就像死树做的纸，来宣传你们的服务？”

And we would say, 'Well, our service is about the real world, and we aren't advertising using flyers and postcards; our neighbors are using those mechanisms to tell their neighbors who they don't know about this new service'.

我们会说：“嗯，我们的服务是关于真实世界的，我们不是用传单和明信片来做广告；是我们的邻居们在用这些方式，向他们不认识的邻居们介绍这项新服务。”

It ended up working; we're in over 90% of neighborhoods in the country, but it was very slow, although it was steady.

结果成功了；我们覆盖了全国90%以上的社区，虽然进展非常缓慢，但却很稳定。

And one of the learnings for us is that great community building happens bottoms up; it can't happen top down.

对我们而言，其中一个经验是，伟大的社区建设是自下而上发生的；它不能自上而下。

And sometimes that means it's slow but steady versus fast and instant, and we live in an industry where companies seem to grow with the snap of fingers, where successes are called overnight successes.

有时这意味着它缓慢而稳健，而非快速和即时，我们所处的行业中，公司似乎能一蹴而就地成长，成功被称为“一夜成名”。

But long-term value and community, which is a uniquely human value, well, that's something like trust that takes a lot of time to build.

但长期价值和社区，这是一种独特的人类价值，就像信任一样，需要大量时间来建立。

You can lose it instantly, but to gain it takes repeated effort.

你可以瞬间失去它，但要赢得它需要反复的努力。

And so all of our challenges, they've all been in the variety of choosing in many cases the hard thing to do because it's the thing that's going to drive the most long-term value when in almost every case the conventional wisdom is go and do the things that you can do quickly and easily and efficiently.

因此，我们所有的挑战，在很多情况下都是选择去做那些困难的事情，因为这些事情将带来最大的长期价值，而几乎在所有情况下，传统观念都是选择快速、轻松、高效地完成任务。

But for us, it's about choosing the things that build community, and in almost all cases, those are the things that take forever.

但对我们而言，关键在于选择那些能够建设社区的事情，而在几乎所有情况下，这些事情都需要耗费很长的时间。

### 领导力的本质：先“人”后“事”与赋能

Being a founder, being a CEO, being an executive, it's a lonely journey.

作为创始人、首席执行官、高管，这是一段孤独的旅程。

It's not easy to talk about the struggle; it's not easy to confide in people; you want to be the person who's confident, who's optimistic, who's secure that what we're doing is the right thing.

谈论挣扎并不容易；向人倾诉也不容易；你希望自己是那个自信、乐观、确信我们所做的事情是正确的人。

But in reality, it's very, very, very challenging, and there are many moments when you're unsure of yourself.

但实际上，这非常、非常、非常具有挑战性，有很多时候你会对自己感到不确定。

How do you get around those moments? For me, I would tell entrepreneurs and founders, the solution has been to first focus on who and then what.

如何克服那些时刻？对我而言，我会告诉创业者和创始人，解决方案是先关注“人”，再关注“事”。

And that means first thinking about your teammates versus the business opportunity.

这意味着首先考虑你的团队成员，而不是商业机会。

So many founders start by saying what is the business opportunity here? What is the vision that we're trying to build? What is the company we want to create?

很多创始人一开始会问：这里的商业机会是什么？我们想要建立的愿景是什么？我们想创造什么样的公司？

I always started by saying who do I want to work with? Who is going to be my set of co-founders? Because I know that when I'm alone, the lows are even lower, and frankly, the highs are not as high.

我总是先问：我想和谁一起工作？谁将是我的联合创始人？因为我知道，当我独自一人时，低谷会更低，坦率地说，高潮也不会那么高。

But when I'm with a group of people, my community, when I think about we, not me, those lows, they can be overcome, and those highs, they are sublime because I'm sharing them with someone else.

但当我与一群人，我的社区在一起时，当我思考“我们”而不是“我”时，那些低谷可以被克服，那些高潮也变得崇高，因为我与他人分享着它们。

And so, the number one piece of advice that I give founders that I would give anyone trying to do something hard, first focus on who.

所以，我给创始人、也给任何尝试做困难事情的人的首要建议是：首先关注“人”。

And when I thought deeply about the thing that I felt had gone really well, but sometimes not so well and needed to go better, it was all around motivating my teammates.

当我深入思考那些我感觉进展顺利，但有时并不那么顺利，需要做得更好的事情时，这一切都围绕着激励我的团队成员。

How am I interacting with my fellow employees? And ultimately what I realized is leadership is about lifting people up.

我如何与我的同事互动？最终我意识到，领导力在于提升人们。

It's about celebrating their accomplishments, it's about helping them when they feel stuck.

它是关于庆祝他们的成就，在他们感到困惑时帮助他们。

Yes, we need to have incredibly high standards. Yes, we need to always be shooting for the stars. Yes, performance is absolutely the single most important thing in driving success.

是的，我们需要有极高的标准。是的，我们需要始终追求卓越。是的，绩效绝对是推动成功最重要的一点。

You have to perform; we're a public company.

你必须表现出色；我们是一家上市公司。

But as leaders, we can do that by championing people, not beating them down.

但作为领导者，我们可以通过支持员工，而不是打击他们来做到这一点。

And when I thought about my decades as a CEO, there were many moments where my frustration, my stress, and the demands that I put on myself ultimately manifested as me being hard on people.

当我回顾我担任首席执行官的几十年时，有很多时候，我的沮丧、压力以及我对自己提出的要求，最终表现为我对他人过于严厉。

I think it's okay to be hard, but you have to be supportive.

我认为严厉是可以的，但你必须给予支持。

It's okay to be demanding, but you need to be empathetic.

要求高是可以的，但你需要有同理心。

And ultimately, every single one of my colleagues, I know they can get jobs at many other companies, and it's a privilege they've chosen to work with me at Nextdoor.

最终，我的每一位同事，我知道他们可以在许多其他公司找到工作，他们选择在Nextdoor与我共事，这是一种荣幸。

And so my job as a CEO, and I believe the key job of leaders, is to lift people up and make them feel like they can do their best work.

因此，作为首席执行官，我认为领导者的核心职责是提升员工，让他们觉得自己能够发挥出最好的工作表现。

And if that happens, the company can be and will be successful.

如果能做到这一点，公司就能成功，也必将成功。

### AI时代的企业进化与人文关怀

Companies like everything else in the world, they need to evolve; they need to evolve within their four walls and they need to actually harmonize what they're doing with the outside world.

公司，就像世界上其他所有事物一样，需要进化；它们需要在内部进化，也需要将自己的运作与外部世界协调一致。

The way to evolve your company as a leader is to first evolve yourself.

作为一名领导者，让公司进化的方式是首先进化自己。

And so what I found in trying to become **AI-first** (AI优先: 将人工智能作为核心战略和驱动力), **AI-fluent** (AI熟练: 能够熟练使用和理解人工智能技术), **AI-native** (AI原生: 从一开始就以AI为核心设计和运营产品、服务或系统), all of these things that we know are critical in today's world, I have to use AI myself; I can't rely on the old ways of doing things.

因此，我发现在努力成为**AI优先** (AI-first: 将人工智能作为核心战略和驱动力)、**AI熟练** (AI-fluent: 能够熟练使用和理解人工智能技术)、**AI原生** (AI-native: 从一开始就以AI为核心设计和运营产品、服务或系统) 的过程中，所有这些我们深知在当今世界至关重要的事情，我必须亲自使用AI；我不能再依赖旧有的做事方式。

The question is if you could recreate your company from scratch, how would you use AI from day one? And that is the mindset.

问题是，如果你能从零开始重建你的公司，你会如何从第一天起就使用AI？这就是那种思维模式。

It's a business theory called **zero basing** (零基预算法: 一种从零开始而非基于历史数据制定预算或决策的方法).

这是一种名为**零基预算法** (zero basing: 一种从零开始而非基于历史数据制定预算或决策的方法) 的商业理论。

It's not taking something and slowly evolving it; it's taking something and pretending that it's going to be brand new and using the benefits of the new technology to build it from its foundation using the new technology.

它不是渐进式地发展某个事物；而是将某个事物视为全新的，并利用新技术的好处，从基础开始用新技术来构建它。

It's not good enough to simply say, 'How can I use AI to make my business stronger?'

仅仅说“我如何利用AI让我的业务更强大？”是不够的。

The question is, if I were starting my business today, how would AI play a role in making it possible? That's actually the mindset shift that will get people to truly be **AI-native** (AI原生: 从一开始就以AI为核心设计和运营产品、服务或系统).

问题是，如果我今天开始创业，AI将如何在实现这一目标中发挥作用？这才是真正能让人们实现**AI原生** (AI-native: 从一开始就以AI为核心设计和运营产品、服务或系统) 的思维转变。

And so ultimately we need to use **artificial intelligence** (人工智能: 模拟人类智能的机器系统) to train systems, **LLMs** (大型语言模型: 一种通过大量文本数据训练而成的深度学习模型，能理解和生成人类语言), on what a neighborhood thinks is appropriate and what they believe that level of bias should or shouldn't be.

因此，最终我们需要利用**人工智能** (artificial intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统) 来训练系统，特别是**大型语言模型** (LLMs: 一种通过大量文本数据训练而成的深度学习模型，能理解和生成人类语言)，使其理解一个社区认为什么是合适的，以及他们认为偏见的程度应该如何界定。

If we try to approach it from a top-down basis and say these are Nextdoor's rules, well we can come up with simple things: Be civil, be neighborly, be kind, be helpful.

如果我们试图从自上而下的角度来处理，说这些是Nextdoor的规则，那么我们可以提出一些简单的原则：要文明、要友善、要和善、要乐于助人。

But bias is not in those kinds of situations. Bias is more things like, is it appropriate to have a conversation about local politics? Is it appropriate to advertise one small business? In some neighborhoods, it is. In others, commercialism is looked down on.

但偏见并非体现在这些情境中。偏见更多地体现在诸如：讨论本地政治是否合适？宣传一家小型企业是否合适？在某些社区，这是可以的。而在另一些社区，商业行为则受到鄙视。

The power of artificial intelligence is that for all 350,000 of our neighborhoods, we have 15 years of conversations.

人工智能的力量在于，对于我们全部35万个社区，我们拥有长达15年的对话数据。

We can now take AI, run all of those conversations on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis through an LLM to define a set of biases and rules of the road, if you will, cultural norms that are not top-down, but that are bottoms-up.

我们现在可以利用AI，通过大型语言模型对每一个社区的这些对话进行分析，从而定义一套“潜规则”，或者说文化规范，这些规范不是自上而下的，而是自下而上形成的。

A set of cultural norms for every single one of those individual neighborhoods.

为每一个独立的社区制定一套文化规范。

The backdrop for me, and I hope the backdrop for many companies and individuals, will always be how do we use this technology tool to make the human race better?

对我而言，我希望对许多公司和个人而言，背景始终是如何利用这个技术工具来使人类变得更好？

Not to put the human race out of existence, which is the real fear. I don't think it's going to happen. It hasn't happened in the past.

而不是让全人类走向灭绝，那才是真正的恐惧。我不认为这会发生。过去也没有发生过。

But the reason it hasn't and the reason it won't is because people will continue to internalize that it's all about the human. It's all about what makes us people.

但它没有发生的原因，以及它不会发生的原因，是因为人们会继续内化，一切都关乎人类。一切都关乎我们之所以为人的特质。

And that's not something even **artificial general intelligence** (通用人工智能: 具备与人类同等或超越人类智能水平的AI系统) will be able to approximate.

而这并非连**通用人工智能** (artificial general intelligence: 具备与人类同等或超越人类智能水平的AI系统) 都能够模拟的。

And so as long as we remember that, this will be the most powerful tool so far in the history of technology, but still a tool.

所以只要我们记住这一点，这仍将是迄今为止技术史上最强大的工具，但它仍然只是一个工具。
