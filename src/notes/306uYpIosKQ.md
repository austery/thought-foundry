### 开盘综述：市场静待CPI数据

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场开盘》。今天是10月23日，星期四。这一周过得真快，离周五只有一天了。我们在这里直播，有很多内容要讨论，感谢大家的到来。盘前有很多不同的头条新闻，我们都会谈到。明天我们将得到 **CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数）数据。所以我认为今天的市场活动肯定会在一定程度上取决于对CPI数据的看法。我们会谈谈华尔街对CPI可能出现的情况的一些总体预测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Thursday, October 23rd. It has been a pretty quick week. I mean, we are one day away from Friday, but we're here. We're live. We got a lot to talk about. Thank you everybody for being here. Got a bunch of different headlines going on in the pre-market there. We are going to get into tomorrow. We will be getting CPI data. So, I think today's market activity is definitely going to be a bit contingent on the perception of that CPI data. And we're going to talk about some of the overall projections that some of the street has on what they think will happen with CPI.</p>
</details>

除此之外，盘前市场相对乐观，没有太多下跌。昨天市场表现相当糟糕，但在收盘时有所回升，这是个好现象。虽然不是完全恢复，但确实有一定程度的反弹。所以现在我们要看看这种反弹能否持续。标普500指数在盘前是上涨的，许多其他风险资产也是如此。我们会讨论这一点，看看是否能继续保持上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, you have a relatively green pre-market. You're not seeing too much red. We did have a pretty nasty day yesterday that ended up recovering towards the end of the day, which was good to see. Not a full recovery, but you did get somewhat of a bit of recovery. So, now we have to see if that recovery can continue. S&P 500 is green in the pre-market along with a lot of the other risk assets. So, we'll talk about that and we're going to see if that can continue to be green.</p>
</details>

现在，标普指数刚刚转为下跌。十分钟前还是上涨的。但总的来说，情况没有昨天那么糟糕，昨天最差时下跌了约1.2%到2%。标普500指数目前下跌约0.4%，AMD下跌0.5%，SoFi下跌0.4%。谷歌实际上是上涨的，Grab也上涨，亚马逊也上涨。Hoodie小幅下跌，然后Palantir下跌约0.74%。我们还有一个Palantir的新合同要谈，是与Lumen Technologies签订的2亿美元的协议。所以我们会深入探讨这份合同，并讨论Palantir的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, S&P, okay, just flipped red. It was green like 10 minutes ago. But overall, it's not as bad as it was yesterday when yesterday was down about 1.2% to 2% at the worst of it. S&P 500 right there down about 0.4%, AMD down half a percent. SoFi down 0.4%. Google actually green, Grab green, Amazon green. Hoodie down a little bit and then Palantir down about 0.74%. We also have a new Palantir contract that we'll talk about, a $200 million deal with Lumen Technologies. So we'll get into that contract and discuss what's going on with Palantir as well.</p>
</details>

我们还有关于中美贸易谈判的一些更新，我们也会讨论。希望我们能更接近于双方都做出一些让步和妥协，最终达成某种协议。也许这会在与习近平在韩国会晤之前发生。特朗普将前往马来西亚。他今天下午3点将在椭圆形办公室发布一项声明。不知道声明内容是什么。上次是关于体外受精的，所以可能与经济无关，但我们将在下午3点看看他会谈些什么。然后我相信他明天去马来西亚，下周去韩国与习主席进行谈判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have some updates on the China trade negotiations. We'll talk about that. Hopefully we are getting closer to somewhat of a capitulation from both sides to give a little bit and take a little bit and hopefully we get something where it's like, all right, this is what's going to happen. And maybe that ends up taking place before the meetings in South Korea with Xi. Trump will be going to Malaysia. He's going to do an announcement at 3 p.m. in the Oval Office today. Don't know what the announcement is going to be about. Last time it was about in vitro fertilization. So it might not even be about the economy, but we're going to see later at 3 p.m. what he talks about. And then I believe tomorrow he goes to Malaysia and then next week he goes to South Korea for those negotiations with President Xi.</p>
</details>

除此之外，特斯拉在盘前下跌了约4%。我们将讨论特斯拉发生了什么。看，这不是世界上最好的财报，但绝对也不是最差的。所以市场的反应有点横盘整理。下跌3%的价格与特斯拉上周的价格相似。所以我认为如果你是特斯拉的股东，这并不是什么大问题。但无论如何，我们会讨论埃隆在电话会议上说了什么，以及特斯拉财报中提出的核心论点。不幸的是，他们的 **EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）未达预期，差了大约5美分。他们在收入上超过了预期，然后我们会继续讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, you got Tesla down about 4% right here in the pre-markets. We will be discussing what happened with Tesla. Look, it was not the best earnings in the world. It was definitely not the worst earnings in the world. So, the street's giving it a bit of a sideways reaction. 3% down is similar price to where Tesla was last week. So, I think if you're a Tesla shareholder, it's not that big of a deal. But, nonetheless, we'll discuss kind of what Elon said on the call and the core arguments that were made on the Tesla earnings. They did miss on EPS unfortunately by about 5 cents. They beat on revenue and then we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

盘前还有很多其他公司公布了财报。几乎所有公司再次在营收和利润上都超出了预期，这非常好。到目前为止，标普500指数中85%的公司财报都超出了预期。如果这种情况能持续到下周，那将是大型科技公司财报最重要的一周，那么这对整个市场来说也应该是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have a bunch of other companies in the pre-markets that reported earnings. Pretty much all of them again beats on the top and the bottom line which is really good. So far 85% of companies that reporting the S&P 500 have beat their earnings. And if that can continue going into next week, which is going to be the biggest week for big tech earnings, then that should be good for the broader markets as well.</p>
</details>

### 焦点：特朗普政府或入股量子计算公司

好了，让我们开始讨论第一个故事。这个故事我前几分钟没有提到，但我认为这是最劲爆的故事。所以我们不妨从这个开始。那就是关于量子计算的故事。过去一周发生了什么？很多量子计算概念股下跌了30%到40%。量子生态系统可以说是一片血海。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started with the first story. And this first story actually is something I didn't mention for the past couple minutes. But I think it is the juiciest story. And so we might as well start off with this one. And that is the story of Quantum. So what happened over the past week? A lot of these quantum names ended up going down 30 to 40%. It's been pretty much a bloodbath in the quantum ecosystem.</p>
</details>

昨晚我做深度研究时，正在写一些东西，我希望明天能发布。我正在Substack上做一些研究和写作，然后我看了看推特，这是弹出的第一个头条新闻，我知道这将成为接下来24小时的故事，而且它确实成为了接下来24小时的故事。特朗普政府正在洽谈入股量子计算公司，包括NQ、D-Wave和Regetti。我看到这个标题时，简直不敢相信，这不可能是真的。但这就是头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last night actually when I was doing my deep dive, I was working on the Nebus deep dive for tomorrow. I was doing some research writing on Substack and then I looked over on Twitter and this was the first headline that popped up and I knew this was going to be the story of the next 24 hours and it has become the story of the next 24 hours. The Trump administration is in talks to take equity stakes in quantum computing firms including NQ, D-Wave, and Regetti. I mean, I saw the headline and I was just like, you got to be kidding me. This can't be real life. But this was the headline.</p>
</details>

公平地说，《华尔街日报》报道后，路透社今天早上出来说，一位商务部代表表示他们没有与这些公司进行具体的对话。但《华尔街日报》的消息来源称，他们确实在与许多量子计算公司进行对话。结果，NQ在盘前上涨了8%，D-Wave上涨了16%，Regetti上涨了9%。这些股票在过去一周都下跌了大约30%到40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, to be fair to the Wall Street Journal, Reuters came out this morning and said there's a commerce representative that said they are not specifically in conversations with these companies, but the sources that the Wall Street Journal was using says no, they are in conversation with a lot of these quantum computing companies. And as a result, NQ up 8% in the pre-market, D-Wave up 16% in the pre-market, and then Regetti up 9% in the pre-market. All these stocks are down about 30-40% for the past week.</p>
</details>

所以这里有两个角度。首先，我想从如果这件事发生会是怎样的角度来分析，同时也要承认有政府官员说这件事不会发生。所以现在这有点像“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”的故事。我们不确定这是否会发生，但根据传言，这些股票在盘前上涨了。而且，这个传言来自《华尔街日报》，肯定会让更多人认为这事有可能发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's two angles to this. First of all, I want to do the angle of what it would be like if this were to happen while acknowledging at the same time that there were government officials that said this is not happening. So, right now, it's kind of a story of he said, she said. We don't officially know if this is going to happen or not, but the stocks are up right now in the pre-market based on the rumor that it's going to happen. And you know, the rumor coming from the Wall Street Journal will definitely get a lot more people to think that there is a possibility for this.</p>
</details>

### 深度分析：量子投资背后的利益疑云

我深入研究了一下，试图理解这么做的动机和激励是什么。推特上有几个人给我指明了方向。你看，当你深入这个兔子洞时，事情确实开始变得更有道理了。美国政府的国防部副部长是一个叫史蒂夫·范伯格（Steve Fineberg）的人。范伯格还共同创立了一家名为Cerebras资本管理公司的对冲基金，并担任了30年的CEO，直到大约七个月前，也就是2025年3月离职，成为国防部副部长。那家对冲基金在NQ公司持有价值数亿美元的头寸，大约是240万股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I went down the rabbit hole and I tried to understand what would be the incentive and motivation for this. And there was a couple people on Twitter that pointed me to this direction. And look, when you go down this rabbit hole, it does start to make a lot more sense. The deputy secretary of defense for the US government is a person named Steve Fineberg. Okay. Fineberg also co-founded a hedge fund called Cerebras Capital Management and he was the CEO for 30 years of this hedge fund before he left in March of 2025 which was like seven months ago to become the deputy secretary of defense. That hedge fund has a position to the tune of hundreds of millions in NQ which is about 2.4 million shares.</p>
</details>

所以，再次强调，我们不确切知道这里发生了什么，但这对我来说开始变得更有道理了。我的直觉是，如果这件事真的发生，如果美国政府真的入股这些公司，我不认为是因为特朗普相信量子计算。我也不认为是因为政府认为量子计算是技术的下一次革命，需要通过入股来重点关注。我个人认为，这只是直觉，政府里有些人想确保他们能抬高自己的股票。看起来就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look again we don't know exactly what's happening here but this is starting to make a lot more sense to me. My gut intuition on this is if this were to happen, if the United States government were to take equity stakes in these companies, I do not think it's because Trump believes in quantum computing. I do not think it's because the administration thinks quantum computing is the next evolution of technology that they need to have a major focus in by taking an equity stake in. I personally think again gut reaction that there are some people in that administration that want to make sure they can pump their bags. That's kind of what it's looking like.</p>
</details>

### 为何政府补贴量子计算引人质疑？

这是我的理由。可能会有人不同意，但我愿意改变我的看法。第一，为什么美国纳税人要补贴量子计算？我能理解为什么美国纳税人要补贴锂矿，我能理解为什么美国纳税人要从国家安全的角度补贴半导体。我能理解为什么我们必须补贴稀土矿物和金属，因为归根结底，所有这些产品都是我们日常生活中必不可少的部分。但我完全不明白为什么我们必须补贴量子计算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here's my reasoning for why. And I'm open to change my opinion. Number one, why does the US taxpayer have to subsidize quantum? I can understand why the US taxpayer has to subsidize lithium. I can understand why the US taxpayer has to subsidize semiconductors from a national security perspective. I can understand why we have to subsidize rare earth minerals and metals because at the end of the day, all those products are necessary in every part of our daily life. I have no idea why we have to subsidize quantum.</p>
</details>

另一个我不理解为什么要补贴量子计算的原因是，谷歌刚刚在量子领域取得了巨大突破。桑达尔昨天宣布他们在Willow项目上取得了重大进展，这并没有得到美国纳税人的补贴。这是谷歌作为一家公司，用他们的自由现金流，因为他们能真正产生收入，不像这些公司中的一些，能够投资并投入研发来构建量子计算。所以从这个角度来看，我不太明白为什么美国政府需要补贴这些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And another reason I don't understand why we have to subsidize quantum, Google just to the bullcase of quantum, Sundar just announced that they had a massive breakthrough in Willow yesterday that was not subsidized by the US taxpayer. That was Google as a company with their free cash flow because they actually generate revenue unlike some of these companies are able to invest and put the R&D into building out quantum computing. So from that perspective, I don't necessarily understand why the United States government would have to subsidize some of these companies.</p>
</details>

而且我也不明白为什么纳税人要为此买单，因为这些是私营公司在做的事情。我们20年前也没有补贴英伟达研发GPU。他们自己研发，开发了知识产权，然后最终变成了现实。所以我不知道为什么会是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it also doesn't make sense to me why the taxpayers have to foot the bill for that because these are private companies working on it. We didn't subsidize Nvidia when they were working on GPUs 20 years ago. They worked on it. They developed the intellectual property and then it ended up becoming a reality. So I don't know exactly why that's the case.</p>
</details>

此外，如果你通读这篇文章，会发现美国考虑的投资额是1000万美元的资金奖励，也就是1000万美元的股权。根据《华尔街日报》的报道，这些公司的市值在150到200亿美元之间。1000万美元简直是九牛一毛。我的意思是，1000万美元，大概只占这些公司0.001%的股份。这不像他们对英特尔的80亿美元投资。所以从这个角度来看，这也相当奇怪，因为说到底，1000万美元根本不算什么。所以这个新闻标题本身比股权投资更重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, if you read through the article, it's a $10 million funding award, aka a $10 million equity stake, that the United States is thinking of taking if this were to happen. Based on the reporting from the Wall Street Journal, these companies are worth 15 to 20 billion. $10 million is absolutely nothing. I mean, $10 million, it's like a 0.001% stake of of of these companies. This is not like a $8 billion stake like they took in Intel. So from that perspective, it's also pretty weird because at the end of the day, it's like, well, wait a second. $10 million is absolutely nothing. So the headline in and of itself is more important than the equity stake.</p>
</details>

1000万美元根本不现实。这些公司市值近200亿美元，1000万美元有什么用？这甚至都不能算作真正的股权投资，不能让美国政府关注并确保公司发展良好。所以在我看来，如果这件事真的发生——而且今天早上有相互矛盾的报道说这不会发生，但股票的反应却像是会发生一样，价格在9:30走高——我们得看市场开盘后情况如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">10 million is not real, bro. These companies are worth almost $20 billion. What's the point of 10 million? Like that's not even an equity. That's not like a real stake in the company where the United States could be focused on like, oh, we have this massive stake. We need to make sure we support that the company does well. So look, from my perspective, if this were to happen, and again, you have conflicting reports this morning saying it's not going to happen, but then again, the stocks are reacting as if it is going to happen based on their prices going higher at 9:30. We're going to see when the market opens how this plays out.</p>
</details>

如果这真的发生了，那么美国基本上是将所有这些量子计算公司归类为与半导体和稀土金属同等级别的国家安全利益相关者。我不知道情况是否真是如此。也许是吧。我们得看看特朗普政府会怎么说。如果他们只投资1000万美元，我认为那只是个噱头，因为1000万美元根本不足以让华尔街或民众兴奋，认为政府真的在乎这些公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If this does happen, then the US is basically classifying all these quantum computing names as something that's in the interest of national security to the tune of semiconductors and rare earth metals. I don't know if that's necessarily the case. Maybe that is the case. We're going to see what the Trump administration says. If they only take a $10 million equity stake, I don't think at that point it's just a headline because 10 million is nothing substantial to get the street excited or really to get like people excited that the government actually cares about these companies.</p>
</details>

最后，通过深入挖掘，你会看到一些政府官员，看看他们在对冲基金和资金管理基金中的头寸，你就会开始意识到，也许有些人告诉特朗普往量子领域投点钱，好让市场兴奋起来。所以，这就是我们现在的情况。我们将看看这最终会如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then finally, based on going down a little bit of a rabbit hole, you see some of the people that are part of the administrations, see some of the positions they have in terms of their hedge funds and money management funds, and you start to realize, you know, maybe some people told Don to take to put a little money into quantum to get the street excited. So, that's what we got going on right now. We're going to see how this ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

最终，我们将看到量子计算的未来会是怎样。但这就是头条新闻。而且，事情是这样的，尽管我对以这些估值购买这些股票不感兴趣，也绝对不感兴趣做空，我甚至没有买入看跌期权或任何反向做空基金，因为归根结底，很多这类股票都是由炒作和叙事驱动的。如果叙事变成美国政府希望确保量子计算成功，无论出于何种原因，美国政府对此非常感兴趣，那么你很可能不会看到量子股票归零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately, we're going to see what the future of quantum computing looks like. But, that is the headline. And look, here's the thing, and this is why as much as I'm not interested in buying these stocks at these valuations, definitely not interested at shorting, and I've, you know, not even taken a put position or bought any of the inverse short funds because at the end of the day, a lot of these names are driven by hype and narrative. And if the narrative becomes that the US government wants to make sure that quantum succeeds, for whatever reason, the US government is super interested in it. Uh, yeah, you're likely not going to see quantum stocks go to zero.</p>
</details>

你甚至可能不会看到它们像过去一周那样下跌30-40%，因为一旦政府介入，你就有了兜底。你有了政府的保障。所以，我不知道。昨天Sprrowley对此的看法是，这是一个绝佳的做空机会，因为这很愚蠢，而且会为做空这些股票的人提供一个更好的入场点。再说一次，我认为做空这些股票很难，因为你必须对叙事有非常准确的判断，而你可能判断不准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you're likely not even going to see them take that 30-40% draw downs that they taken over the past week because once the government's on board, you have a backstop. You have a backstop by the government. So, I don't know. Now, Sprrowley's thoughts on this yesterday was that this is a perfect short opportunity because this is stupid and that it's going to lead to an even better entry to people, you know, going short for a lot of these names. Again, I just think shorting these names is tough because you've got to be so right about the narrative and you might just not be right about the narrative.</p>
</details>

但看到特朗普政府理论上可能入股一些量子公司，确实有点疯狂。这也让你思考，政府的风险投资策略的目的是什么？我能理解投资英特尔，因为如果中国大陆攻打台湾，我们需要自己的芯片。我能理解投资稀土金属，因为如果中国实施大规模出口管制，我们必须有自己的稀土金属。但到什么时候这就变成了一种中饱私囊的勾当？比如，“哦，我要入股Facebook。”现在就变成了，“政府没必要入股。”“是的，但政府想入股。”这就像，“那没道理啊。”“我要入股SoFi。我们需要确保美国的在线银行业务安全。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it is kind of wild to see that the Trump administration theoretically could take a stake in some of these quantum companies. It also makes you wonder like again what is the purpose of the government and the sort of venture capital strategy because I can understand it when it's for Intel because like look if China invades Taiwan we need our new chips. I can understand when it's for rare earth metals because if China has massive export controls we have to have our own rare earth metals. At what point does it just become a grift? Like at what point is like, "Oh, I'm just going to take a stake in Facebook." Now it's like, "Well, there's no need for the government to take a stake." Yeah, but the government wants to take a stake. It's like, well, that doesn't make sense. I'm gonna take a stake in SoFi. We need to make sure we secure online banking in the United States.</p>
</details>

到什么时候，政府就变成了想做什么就做什么，来炒作不同的行业。我不喜欢这样。我认为很多信奉自由市场资本主义的人也不会喜欢。但无论如何，这可能是正在发生的事情。所以，我们必须在未来几年里看看这会如何发展。我很好奇市场开盘时，市场是否真的相信这个故事？他们是否相信这个叙事，还是这些股票最终会下跌？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, at what point does it become just the government literally doing whatever they want to do to pump different sectors. And I am not a fan of that. I think a lot of people that believe in free market capitalism would not be fans of that. But, nonetheless, that could be something that's playing out. So, we're going to have to see over the coming years how this ends up happening. Very curious to see when the market opens. Does the market actually believe in this story? Does they do they believe in this narrative or do these stocks end up getting hit?</p>
</details>

### 特斯拉财报解读：增长曲线在何方？

好了，这就是量子计算的情况。让我们来看看其他一些故事。特斯拉，我们来谈谈它。特斯拉的利润未达预期，营收符合预期。现在股价是422.15美元。昨天我和史蒂夫听了电话会议。会议还行。埃隆比90天前更有活力，但在很多承诺方面并没有太大不同，也没有解释他们将如何实现这些目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So, cool. That's what we got with Quantum. Let's get into some of these other stories. Tesla, so let's talk about it. Tesla, they missed on the bottom line. Came in line with expectations on the top line. 422.15. This is what you have right now. We listened to the call yesterday, me and Steve. I mean, it was an okay call. Elon was a bit more energetic than he was from 90 days ago, but it wasn't necessarily that different in terms of a lot of promises and not necessarily an explanation on how they're going to get there.</p>
</details>

我对特斯拉的看法是，明年的能源业务，即使翻倍，在盈利增长方面也不会对业务产生实质性影响。机器人明年也不会出现。事实上，埃隆确实说过Optimus的生产将于2026年开始，也就是他们将建设生产线，这非常乐观，但这并不意味着Optimus将在任何有意义的商业应用中出货。所以，你在2026年不会看到Optimus带来的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My my thing with Tesla here is that energy next year, even if it if it doubles, it doesn't make a material change in the business in terms of the earnings growth. Uh robots are not coming next year. In fact, Elon did say that the production for Optimus is going to start in 2026, aka they're going to build production lines, which is super bullish, but that doesn't mean that Optimus is going to be shipped in any meaningful commercial application. So, you're not going to get Optimus growth in 2026.</p>
</details>

那么剩下的就只有汽车交付和 **FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 全自动驾驶）了。假设由于利率下降，汽车交付量略有上升，但由于电动汽车信贷取消，增幅不会太大。我看到的特斯拉唯一的另一个增长点就是FSD。埃隆昨天确实谈到了FSD，他提到FSD将是特斯拉继续获胜的原因。他关于FSD的原话是，“简单的杀手级应用是，如果你可以在车里发短信。如果我们能让无人监督的史诗级FSD变得足够好，以至于你可以边开车边发短信，那么每个人都会买这辆车。我百分之百相信我们能做到这一点。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the only thing left then is vehicle deliveries and FSD. Let's say vehicle deliveries are slightly up because rates come down, but they're not up like crazy because the EV credit goes away. The only other vertical I see for Tesla is FSD. And Elon did talk about FSD yesterday and he mentioned that FSD is going to be the reason why Tesla continues to win. His exact quote on FSD was that uh here's the thing. The simple killer app is that if you can text in the car, if we can get unsupervised epic so FSD to be so good that you can text and drive, everyone will buy the car. I'm 100% confident we can make this happen.</p>
</details>

看，我认为长期持有特斯拉并接触实体AI时代非常重要。但从逻辑上讲，现在它的估值这么高，我看不到2026年有什么增长曲线可以改变盈利增长。特斯拉的年增长率为负30%，而其自由现金流市盈率是200倍，市盈率我认为是145倍。估值倍数什么的无所谓，特斯拉从来不是靠倍数交易的，但关键是，这不是一支250美元的股票，不是200美元，不是150美元，甚至不是300美元，现在是422美元，而且它没有增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Look, I think it's very important to be long Tesla and have exposure to the age of physical AI. I just logically now that it's at this valuation don't see in 2026 what is the growth curve that can change earnings growth. Tesla is growing negative 30% year-over-year and it's trading at 200 times free cash flow and you know 200 I think it's 145 times PE like and the multiples are whatever right Tesla's never really traded on multiples but the point is this is not a stock that's at 250 it's not at 200 it's not at 150 it's not even at 300 it's now at 422 and it's not growing.</p>
</details>

所以我不知道2026年是否是他们转向增长的一年。当你看到英伟达在增长，亚马逊在增长，谷歌在增长时，押注一个估值和倍数已经如此之高却没有显示出增长的公司就有点难了。我的意思是，很多这些增长股，你可以不同意它们的倍数，但如果它们真的在增长，你至少可以说它们可以成长到配得上这个估值。特斯拉将不得不在2026年拿出一些数据，也许那一年还不行。也许是27年，你只需要耐心等待才能获得那个增长率，但就目前而言，还没有。我认为每个特斯拉投资者都必须对正在发生的现实保持相当诚实的态度。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I don't know if 2026 is the year where they switch to growth. It's just when you have an Nvidia that's growing and an Amazon that's growing a Google that's growing it's a little tough to bet on something that already has such a stretched valuation and stretch multiple that is not showing the growth. I mean, a lot of these growth stocks that are growing, you can disagree with the multiples, but if they're actually growing, you can at least say they can grow into the valuation. Tesla's going to really have to put up some numbers in 2026 and maybe that's not the year. Maybe it's 27 and you just have to be patient with it in order to get that growth rate, but as of now, that's just not there. And I think every Tesla investor has to be pretty honest with with, you know, that reality of what's happening.</p>
</details>

尽管如此，电话会议结束时，埃隆说：“请投票支持薪酬方案。”所以他们确实做了一点推销。我认为他最终会得到投票。我认为11月6日是实际的股东大会。他们还跳过了一些人们关心的问题，比如未来的产品，我认为这也惹恼了很多股东，因为他们没有真正谈论人们想听的东西。所以，这是一个平平的季度，就这样吧。不好也不坏。股票相对平稳，我认为这也是很多人对特斯拉的预期。

<p class="english-text">Nonetheless, the call ended by Elon saying, "Please vote for the the pay package." So, they did have a bit of a sales pitch right there. I think he will end up getting that vote. I think November 6th is the actual shareholder meeting. They also skipped over a bunch of questions that people cared about like future products, which also I think pissed off a lot of shareholders because, you know, they didn't really talk about the stuff that people wanted to to hear about. So, it was a it was eh quarter like it is what it is. It wasn't too good, wasn't too great. Stocks relatively flat and I think that's what a lot of people expected for us to get on Tesla as well.</p>

### Palantir 斩获两亿美元新合同

我们来谈谈Palantir。今天早上Palantir有一件重要的事情。Palantir与Lumen签订了一份价值2亿美元的合同。这实际上是一笔非常有趣的交易，因为当我去AIPCON大会时，Palantir有一个类似的交易，或者说他们谈到了与Lumen的合作关系，但现在我们终于得到了一些关于这个合作关系的真实数据。顺便说一句，卡普今天会上福克斯新闻。所以我们将看到卡普的直播。这是在财报发布前一周，所以能看到他会很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's do Palanteer. So, Palanteer, this was an important thing this morning. Palanteer inked a deal with 200 million or worth 200 million uh with Lumen. So, this was actually a really uh interesting deal because when I went to AIPCON, uh Palunteer had a similar deal that was like this or they had they talked about their Lumen partnership, but now we actually got some real stats on what this Lumen partnership look like. By the way, Karp's going to be on Fox News today. Karp is going to be on Fox News. So, we're going to get to see Karp live. Uh this is a week before earnings, so it's going to be really nice to see him.</p>
</details>

以下是合作关系的一些细节。Lumen是行业领导者，为人工智能时代构建核心基础设施。今天宣布了一项为期多年、价值数百万美元的战略合作伙伴关系，以帮助各行各业的企业在复杂的多云环境中更快、更安全地部署人工智能。Lumen的首席执行官说：“Palantir解放数据，而Lumen移动数据。我们共同处于独特的地位，能够以前所未有的规模和速度帮助企业实现其雄心。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here are some details from the partnership. Luminer industry leaders building core infrastructure for the AI era today announced a multi-year multi-million dollar strategic partnership to help enterprises across every industry deploy AI faster and more securely in complex multi cloud environments. Uh CEO of Lumen said pounce or freeze data while Lumen moves it. Together, we're uniquely positioned to enable enterprises to unlock their ambitions with unprecedented scale and speed.</p>
</details>

然后卡普在新闻稿中说：“我们与Lumen的合作达到了新的高度。美国公司需要从人工智能中释放即时价值。我们很自豪能与Lumen合作，为我们的客户提供基础设施和智能层，让他们成为人工智能的赢家。” 2亿美元。所以，如果你长期持有Palantir，我认为越来越多这样的商业交易会继续出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you had Karp on the press release say, "Our partnership with Lumen has reached new heights. American companies need to unlock immediate value from AI. We are proud to work with Lumen to enable the infrastructure and intelligence layers for our customers to become AI winners. Uh 200 million. So look, uh if you're long Palunteer, I think more and more of these commercial deals are going to continue to operate.</p>
</details>

关于Palantir的一件事，以及这次与Lumen的合作，是它将对Lumen合作的许多第三方分销商和供应商产生下游效应，这也是新闻稿所要表达的。因此，这应该能真正帮助他们处理更多商业增长的上市策略。如果我们能在第三季度达到50%的增长数字，我确实认为这支股票有很好的上涨空间。我昨天在172.38美元的价格买了一点，所以在昨天下跌疲软时买入了一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things about Palanteer is that and this partnership with Lumen is that it's going to have downstream effects on a lot of the third-party distributors and vendors that Lumen works it works with which is what the press release was going into and so this should really help their kind of go to market approach in regards to dealing with more commercial growth and you know if we can get that 50% number going into Q3 I do think the stock has some good room to potentially run. I did buy a little bit yesterday at 172.38 and so I bought a little bit of the dip yesterday um on some of the downside weakness.</p>

### SMCI 业绩预告不及预期，股价震荡

SMCI怎么了？哇，下跌了5%。好的，SMCI发生了什么？我没看到任何新闻标题。哦，天哪。等等。SMCI提供了……这是财报还是……不，这不是财报。这看起来是第一季度的初步更新。好的，让我把这个调出来。他们的财报电话会议定于11月4日，但他们确实给出了一个初步更新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SMCI. Whoa. 5% down. Okay. What's happening with SMCI? I don't see a single headline. Oh. Oh, boy. Hold on. SMCI provides. Is this earnings or is this uh No, this is not earnings. This is I guess they had earning this is it looks like a preliminary update for the first quarter. SMCI. Okay. So, let me let me just pull this up. I guess it is no no their earnings call is scheduled for November 4th, but they did give a preliminary update.</p>
</details>

好的，数据显示，2026年的新设计中标额超过120亿美元。第一季度收入为50亿美元。哦，这未达到指引。华尔街预期是60到70亿美元，结果是50亿美元。由于订单升级，第一季度的收入延迟到第二季度。Blackwell Ultra GPU和液体冷却解决方案的需求强劲。公司重申2026财年收入目标至少为330亿美元。财报电话会议在11月4日。好的，所以他们未达到预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the numbers are uh new design wins exceeding 12 billion for 2026. Q1 revenue at 5 billion. Oh, that misguidance. Street thought 6 to 7 billion came in at 5 billion. Delayed Q1 revenue shifts to second quarter due to order upgrades. Strong demand seen for Blackwell ultra GPUs and liquid cooling solutions. Company reiterates fiscal year 2026 revenue target of at least 33 billion. Earnings call on November 4th. Okay, so they missed estimates.</p>
</details>

他们未达到预期。看起来几个月前他们预计是60到70亿，结果是50亿。可能他们未达预期的原因是有利的，比如因为需求旺盛导致供应链瓶颈，因为他们确实说需求强劲。但无论如何，如果你未达到预期，那就不是什么好事。SMCI就在那里，49.46美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They missed estimates. I mean, it looks like they got it for six to seven a couple months ago and they came in at five billion. Potentially, they could have missed estimates for a good reason. Aka, they had uh supply chain bottlenecks on their demand because they are saying they do have strong demand. But nonetheless, if you miss estimates, that's not the best in the world. There you go, SMCI right there. 49.46.</p>

### 加密货币市场动态与监管前景

几天前美联储举办了一个大型的加密货币圆桌会议。这是Coinbase首席执行官布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗（Brian Armstrong）对那次会议的看法，以及加密货币立法在美国如何开始变得更加清晰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, remember that big crypto like round table that uh the Fed had a couple of days ago. Here's uh what Brian Armstrong had to say about that round table and uh basically where crypto legislation is starting to get a lot more clarity in the United States.</p>
</details>

> 是的。我们与参议院的民主党人和共和党人进行了很棒的会议。好消息是，有强烈的两党支持和意愿来完成这项市场结构立法。这对美国和5000万使用过加密货币的美国人来说很重要，他们希望看到它完成。我们听到的一个日期是，争取在感恩节前完成这项立法草案的审议。我认为90%的问题已经达成一致并同意，草案文本正在来回传递。有很多很棒的跨职能合作正在进行。剩下的10%是遗留问题，每个人都承诺会坐下来一起解决，希望我们能在感恩节前看到一些草案文本或让它通过委员会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, we had great meetings with the Democrats on in the Senate and on the Republican side today. And the good news is that there's strong bipartisan support and will to get this market structure legislation done. It's important for America and the 50 million Americans who've used crypto want to see it get done. And so one date we heard floated was let's try to get this markup done uh before Thanksgiving. I think that there's 90% of the issues are already aligned on and agreed and there's draft text going back and forth. A lot of great crossunctional uh collaboration happening there. That last 10% are the remaining issues and everyone committed to get in the room together and work it out and hopefully we'll see some draft text or get it out of committee by Thanksgiving.</p>
</details>

所以，Coinbase的CEO布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗对美国将能够为加密货币采取的立法承诺感到非常乐观。是的，政府仍然停摆。这是停摆的第22天。然而，他们确实举行了那个圆桌会议，我猜那并不真正属于政府的一部分。它属于美联储，尽管美联储是政府的一部分，但他们仍然举行了那个会议，布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗确实对加密货币方面能有一些更新感到乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So, you got Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, feeling pretty damn bullish about uh the legislative commitment that the United States will be able to take for crypto. Yes, the government is shut down still. This is the 22nd day of the shutdown. However, they did have that roundt which like I guess wasn't really part of the government. It was part of the Fed even though the Fed is part of the government but they still have that shutdown or they still have that roundt and Brian Armstrong does feel bullish that there can be some updates on crypto.</p>
</details>

Andreessen Horowitz，国内最好的风险投资公司之一，发布了他们的《加密货币状况》报告，其中有一些非常有趣的内容。他们一直是加密货币的大投资者。我想重点介绍几张幻灯片。看看这个。他们说稳定币已经正式找到了产品市场契合点，现在在交易量上可以与世界上最大的支付网络相媲美。原因是美国正在认识到稳定币的战略价值，因为它们可以成为国债的主要持有者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Andreessen Horowitz, one of the best venture capital firms in the country did put out their state of crypto report and uh there was some pretty interesting things that they said in the state of crypto. They've been pretty big crypto investors for a while. Couple of slides I wanted to highlight. Take a look at this. They said stable coins have officially found product market fit now rivaling the world's largest payment networks in transaction volume. And the reason for this is because the US is recognizing the strategic value of stable coins as they can become a top holder for um uh for treasuries.</p>

**现实世界资产**（Real-World Assets: RWA）正在将传统金融和加密货币带到链上。300亿美元，包括公司债券、主动管理策略、政府债务、股票、另类基金、大宗商品、私人信贷等已经上链。我认为这是Vlad在Robinet的背景下非常兴奋的事情，因为他认为如果我们能让更多的现实世界资产上链，比如拉里·芬克认为的4.5万亿美元，那将是一个巨大的市场，如果Robinhood只占到上链的4.5万亿美元的一小部分，那对他们的生态系统来说将是一个巨大的推动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Real world assets are bringing traditional finance and crypto on chain. 30 billion including corporate bonds, actively managed strategies, government debt, stocks, alternative funds, commodities, private credit ex private credit, etc. have come on chain. This is what I think Vlad is very excited about in the context of Robnet because he thinks if we get a lot more real world assets on chain to the tune of you know Larry uh Larry Frink thinks $4.5 trillion could end up happening uh to come on chain that would be a massive market and if Robin takes just a small part of that four and a half trillion that comes on chain that would be a massive move for their ecosystem.</p>
</details>

说到Robinhood，顺便说一句，凯西·伍德昨天抄底了。15万股Hoodie，可能在122到125美元的区间。我们确实一度跌到120美元，今天盘前回升到大约128美元，但凯西·伍德也抄底了Hoodie。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of Robin, by the way, Kathy Wood bought the dip yesterday. 150,000 shares of Hoodie, probably at that 122 to 125 range. We did get all the way down to 120, backed up to about 128 in the pre-markets today, but Kathy Wood also did buy the dip on Hoodie.</p>
</details>

最后一张幻灯片，我将从这份加密报告中展示的是，美国已经推进了关键的加密立法，为该行业带来了监管清晰度。所以，你有了更多的清晰度，尤其是在《GENIUS法案》方面，关于加密货币的走向，加密货币的应用走向。你有一个不真正害怕加密货币的政府。我的意思是，美国证券交易委员会主席保罗·阿特金斯完全不像加里·根斯勒。他在如何看待市场方面简直是180度大转弯。因此，我认为这是至少在特朗普执政期间，持有某种加密货币敞口的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
p class="english-text">And the last slide right here that I'll show from this crypto report is that the US has advanced key crypto legislation bringing regulatory clarity to the industry. So, you've got just a lot more clarity, especially with the Genius Act, on where crypto is going, where the application of crypto is going. You have an administration that's not really scared about crypto. I mean, Paul Atkins, the SEC chair, is nothing like Gary Gendzer. It's a literally a 180 in terms of how he thinks about the market. And as a result, I think that's the reason, at least while Trump is in office, to have some type of exposure to crypto.</p>

### 地缘政治与宏观经济动态

这是詹姆森·格里尔（Jameson Greer）关于中国情况以及他们认为谈判将如何发展的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what Jameson Greer said on what's going on with China and essentially how they think this negotiation is going to play out.</p>
</details>

> 所以在日内瓦，我们达成了一项协议，他们将限制稀土出口管制，他们将降低报复性关税，而我们将暂停我们大部分的对等关税。我们遵守了我们的部分，我们保持了低关税，并且在夏天进行了非常友好和建设性的讨论。然后几周前，中国人决定再次扩大对稀土的管制，不仅针对我们，而且针对全世界。现在你听到很多来自中方或其代理人的说法，说美国在过去几年里对我们实施了很多管制，或者他们出台了一项新规定来避免美国出口管制的规避，他们不喜欢，或者他们对船只收费。所以他们尝试了很多不同的说法，而现实是他们只是想对世界施加经济控制。他们从四月份开始用稀土磁铁，他们把其他任何发生的事情都当作借口。现实是，我们在五月份承诺将对他们的对等关税保持在10%。我们遵守了那个承诺，而他们没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So in Geneva, we had an agreement where they would limit their rare earth export controls. they'd keep their retaliatory tariffs down and we would suspend a good portion of our our tariffs uh on the reciprocal tariff. And so we we kept our part. We kept that tariff low and we had very cordial and constructive discussions over the summer and then again a couple of weeks ago the Chinese decided they were just going to go ahead and expand those controls on rare earths again not not on just us but on on the whole world. And now you hear a lot of narratives uh from the Chinese side of their surrogates saying well you know the the Americans have put a lot of controls on us over the past few years or they put out a new rule that would you know to to avoid evasion of US export controls that they didn't like or their fees on ships. So they're trying out a lot of different u narratives when the reality is they just want to exert economic control on the world. They started in April with the rare earth magnets. They're using every anything else that has happened as a pretext. The reality is we made a promise in May to keep our reciprocal tariff on them at 10%. We kept that promise and they have not kept theirs.</p>
</details>

很明显，在稀土出口管制问题上，美中关系有些紧张。再次强调，特朗普在过去几天里一直在一定程度上缓和局势，但韩国的会晤将真正为我们是否能达成合理协议定下基调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So obviously tensions are a bit high in regards to the US-China relations on these rare export or rare earth export controls. Again, Trump has been deescalating to an extent over the past couple of days, but that meeting in South Korea really is going to set the tone for if we can get to a reasonable deal.</p>
</details>

与中国的紧张关系不是最好的，与俄罗斯的紧张关系也是如此。昨天俄罗斯局势升级，因为我们现在制裁了俄罗斯最大的两家石油公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, tensions with China are not the best, but also tensions with Russia. Russia just escalated yesterday as we have now sanctioned two of the biggest oil companies in Russia.</p>
</details>

> 今天在我们所做的事情上是非常重要的一天。看，这些是巨大的制裁。这些非常大。它们是针对他们两家大石油公司的。我们希望这些制裁不会持续太久。我们希望战争能够得到解决。我们刚刚回答了关于我们正在关注的各种导弹和其他一切的问题，但我们认为那没有必要。我们希望看到他们只是接受已经形成很长时间的界线，然后回家。上周他们有近8000名士兵阵亡。上周有很多俄罗斯人被杀，也有很多乌克兰人被杀。我们认为这很荒谬，希望它能结束。

We hope that uh the war will be settled. uh we just answered uh having to do with the various forms of missiles and everything else that we're looking at, but we don't think that's going to be necessary. Uh we would like to see them just take the line that has been formed over quite a long period of time and go and let's, you know, go home. Uh last week they had almost 8,000 soldiers killed. Many Russians were killed last week. Many Ukrainians were killed last week. We think it's ridiculous and would like to have it in.</p>
</details>

由于制裁了俄罗斯的石油公司，油价上涨了6%。这是我们看到的石油市场最大的单日涨幅之一，至少是清晨的涨幅。这相当惊人，因为油价低于60美元本身对经济、汽油价格等都非常有利。但现在油价回升了。特朗普说制裁可能是暂时的，如果他们达成停火或至少结束战争，与俄罗斯的石油局势可能会得到解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a result of sanctioning the oil companies in Russia, uh oil prices are up 6%.

### 市场开盘表现与个股动态

特斯拉在这里受到了冲击。下跌约5%，至418美元。这是下跌的蜡烛图。昨天还在447美元。EPS未达预期，营收符合预期。让我们看看是否有人会介入抄底，还是会继续下跌。Palantir因今天宣布与Lumen Technologies签订2亿美元合同而上涨。Hoodie股价128.41美元。让我们看看Hood能否回到130美元。凯西·伍德昨天抄底了约15万股。标普指数上涨至668点。标普500指数表现不错。

<p class="english-text">Unfortunately, Tessy getting hit right here. Down about 5%. 418. There's the red candle. It was at 447 yesterday. Uh missed on EPS.

Palinger goes green with that $200 million contract that they announced with Lumen Technologies today. Hoodie 128.41. Let's see if Hood can get back up to 130. Kathy Wood did buy the dip of about 150,000 shares yesterday. S&P goes green 668. Not too bad on the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

英伟达股价180.50美元，上涨0.13%。SoFi上涨0.5%，至27.40美元。我买了500股SoFi，平均价格是26.88美元。所以你们可以不用再问我财报前买不买SoFi了，因为我买了。我进场了。我们要么被套牢，要么一起上涨。但SoFi现在是27.30美元，是上涨的。Grab上涨1%，至5.67美元。谷歌253.75美元，上涨。亚马逊218美元，上涨。Salesforce上涨，Meta上涨，PayPal上涨，ELF上涨，苹果上涨。SMCI因初步财报未达营收预期而下跌，但比之前跌得更厉害。之前在46美元，现在反弹回51.50美元。

So you guys can stop asking me to buy SoFi before earnings because I bought it. I'm in. We're either going to bag hold or we're either going to ride it higher. But SoFi right there 27.30. That's green. Grabby Grab that's up 1% 5.67. Google 253.75 that's green. Amazon 218 that's green. Salesforce is up. Meta's up. PayPal's up. ELF is up. Apple's up. SMCI still down based on those preliminary earnings that they gave on the missed expectations of revenue, but it was down a lot worse. It was at 46. So rebounded here back up to 51.50.</p>
</details>

再看看那些高动量股。Oklo下跌2.7%。Oklo本周每天都在下跌，持续受到打击。那么量子股在《华尔街日报》发布消息后表现如何？D-Wave上涨14%，NQ上涨5%，Regetti上涨7%。所以，特朗普政府，《华尔街日报》昨天报道说正在考虑入股这些公司。有一些高级官员出来说我们没有与这些公司就股权进行谈判，但市场不在乎。光是这个标题就足以让这些股票上涨。所以，如果你在过去几天做空了，现在肯定受到了重创。但这些股票继续上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's look at some of the high momentum names. Oaklo down 2.7. Again, Oaklo has been down every single day this week. It continues to get hit. How about the quantum stocks after that Wall Street Journal announcement? D-Wave up 14%, NQ up 5% and Regetti up 7%. So again, the Trump administration, Wall Street Journal reported yesterday thinking of taking equity stakes on these companies. You had some senior officials come out and say we are not negotiating with these companies for an equity stake, but the market doesn't care. The headline alone is enough to get these stocks to get higher. And so, you know, the shorts are really getting hit if you did go short over the past couple of days based on this announcement. But those stocks continue to go green.</p>

### 嘉宾连线：深入探讨特斯拉与SoFi

**Amit:** 好的，关于埃隆的评论，如果你再多播放几秒钟那个片段，他会谈到一些公司有创始人股。

**Tanner:** 对吧？是的。他提到了一些其他做过这件事的企业，但他说据他所知，公司上市后就不能这么做了。

**Amit:** 这完全是胡扯。那不是真的。你知道我怎么知道吗？因为Shopify的CEO托比·卢特克（Toby Lütke）就这么做了。这完全可以验证。你可以查到，公司在2015年上市。托比·卢特克没有创始人股。当公司变得非常庞大时，他不想在没有投票权的情况下继续建设。所以在2022年，他们召开了一次年度股东大会，批准了创始人股，给了他40%的投票权，而公司已经上市七年了。这完全是胡扯。那家伙想要一万亿美元。老实说，我对此没意见。但实话实说。全世界都在看。Shopify也不是一家小公司。我很惊讶没人纠正他这一点。这绝对是胡说八道。

**Tanner:** 所以你认为他本可以获得像扎克伯格那样的创始人级别股份，在过去十年里，他现在却编造借口，通过提出这个机器人军队的担忧来获得更高的薪酬方案。

**Amit:** 他想要一万亿美元，如果公司市值达到8.5万亿。我不知道确切的百分比，但在我看来，这比40%低得多。所以他要求的投票权甚至与托比·卢特克批准的不一致。老实说，我认为股东们会更容易被说服给他40%的投票权，而不是给他一万亿美元。

**Tanner:** 对。对。因为他们更相信他的判断。

**Amit:** 我相信他的判断。我相信他的判断。

**Tanner:** 那你认为他为什么在过去十年里没有争取获得那种投票权呢？

**Amit:** 我不知道。

**Tanner:** 这有点奇怪，对吧？你会认为如果他想对自己的公司有巨大的控制权。我的意思是，扎克伯格几乎拥有60%的投票权，如果我没记错的话。所以这确实有点奇怪，对吧？

**Amit:** 是的。是的。

**Tanner:** 有些人说他实际上不是创始人。那不重要。

**Amit:** 我不这么认为。

**Tanner:** 是的。怎么会？等等，等等。人们认为因为他不是创始人，所以他不能得到创始人股份？伙计们，他就是特斯拉。埃隆就是特斯拉。好吧，所以他不是创始人。顺便说一句，每当埃隆在采访中被问到是不是创始人的问题时，他都会很生气，因为他会说，“兄弟，当时有两个人。他们什么都没做。他们在那里待了一年半，然后我把这个企业变成了今天这个万亿美元的公司。”所以仅仅因为他没有亲自在特拉华州注册公司，并不意味着他不是这个企业的关键部分。

**Amit:** 是的。是的。我们称之为创始人股，但据我所知，这并不意味着你必须是签署官方文件创建公司的董事。这只是一种说法，表示这个人是经营这家企业的人。

**Tanner:** 是的。你可以叫它们任何你想要的名字。它们只需要给他投票权。这才是真正重要的。这是一个公平的观点。总的来说，如果你还持有特斯拉，你会投票支持薪酬方案吗？

**Amit:** 嗯……我不知道，老实说。我对这一轮比上一轮更犹豫。老实说，很大程度上是因为这些关于机器人军队之类的奇怪评论。这是一个非常反乌托邦的未来。

**Tanner:** 但是你认为他得到一万亿美元，而股东们同时也能获得10倍的回报，这是一个好交易吗？

**Amit:** 是的。是的。是的。我只是……我甚至不确定我是否相信这会发生。所以……我想我会……我会允许它发生。我想我会同意，并希望他朝着这个方向努力，但我甚至不确定它是否会通过。我是一个人形机器人的忠实信徒，但我也认为这就像他以前说FSD会在2017、2018年到来一样，我认为这些东西的开发实际上需要更长的时间。所有这些关于机器人是2026年的现象和AGI三个月后就会到来的评论，我都不相信。我没有看到任何迹象。我认为有改进，但他们谈论的巨大改进，我就是没看到。

**Tanner:** 是的。看，我投资了Figure和Electronic以及一些机器人公司，即使我也会承认它们还没有做任何有用的事情。所以，就像……

**Amit:** 是的，我认为它们会做有用的任务，但只是没有埃隆所说的无限金钱漏洞。它们会叠衣服，这很好。那很棒，你知道的，但这些只是我的信念。只是我的信念。

**Tanner:** 是的。嗯，埃隆也说了Optimus的生产将在2026年开始。所以，生产开始后，问题就变成了他们能否在27年真正销售它？而且人工智能必须足够好，才能在一年半内实现商业化，也许可以，也许不行。我的意思是，我们得看看他们行动有多快，但如果不行，那可能就只是一个2030年的故事，而不是27年，这也不是最坏的情况。

**Amit:** 我是埃隆的超级信徒。就……最后一个评论，很快。他们正在与三星开发的那个芯片，据说比竞争对手好10倍。

**Tanner:** 拜托，伙计。

**Amit:** 我很困惑。你对此有什么看法？因为他好像在说，“我们不是想取代英伟达，但我们需要一个比英伟达更好的定制 **ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 专用集成电路）。”我当时有点没跟上他为什么这么说。

**Tanner:** 我认为每个像特斯拉这样规模的公司都应该尝试创造某种版本的定制ASIC。我认为他们都在努力这样做。好的。减少对英伟达的依赖非常重要。嗯……至少这是目标，非常重要。我不认为这会发生。但他说，“嘿，我们不会取代英伟
达，但我们也会有一个每瓦性能比它强10倍的芯片。”那你为什么还要给英伟达打电话呢？你知道，这只是……我认为这些说法现在我有点受够了。我只是觉得都有点夸张。股票的表现与这些说法不符。多年来一直如此。

**Amit:** 是的，我不知道。而且我认为股票也不在乎，因为我们看到在他谈论这个芯片击败英伟达时，股票下跌了4%。没人相信他。股票在这些评论实时播出时就崩溃了。所以他有一个核心受众，但要吸引新投资者以这个价格买入会很困难。

**Tanner:** 嘿，如果能达到8.5万亿美元，这里仍然值得一搏。但我认为有其他更便宜的投资，很容易在其他公司买到其他东西，它们也在创造非常好的产品。

**Amit:** 坦纳，最后一个问题。这是坦纳的推特，请务必订阅并关注他。我现在持有SoFi，26.85美元。我们下周会一飞冲天吗？

**Tanner:** 嗯……

**Amit:** 小心你的用词，因为YouTube可能会封禁这个视频。所以你必须……

**Tanner:** 谨慎用词。我看到的一切都让我非常兴奋。我认为这将是SoFi迄今为止最好的一个季度。我认为他们即将公布的增长率和利润率会吓到空头。华尔街对他们财报的预期，与我的预期相比，根本就不沾边。完全不沾边。

**Amit:** 我们从应用下载量、网站流量、Lending Club、所有大银行、信用卡、券商那里都看到了这一点。SoFi业务涵盖所有这些。目前金融领域没有任何疲软迹象。完全没有。Lending Club刚刚公布了巨大的增长。试图将Lending Club与SoFi相比，就像……我甚至无法做出比较。它们已经完全没有可比性了。但这仍然向你表明，需求，特别是来自保险公司、银行、所有贷款购买者的需求，与SoFi的贷款购买客户非常相似，他们的贷款发放量将会爆炸式增长。我等不及了。这将是一个有趣的星期二。

**Tanner:** 是的，我同意。我的意思是，Lending Club的财报对我来说也是一个信号，表明他们会有一个非常好的季度。所以，谁知道呢，伙计。这是一个高空头仓位的股票。我的意思是，不是超高的空头流量，但仍然有8%到10%的空头涌入。可能会有。然后你第二天就迎来了降息。所以，你肯定能看到一些进展。

**Amit:** 是的，我们会看到的。我们会看到的。不管怎样，伙-计，谢谢你接我的电话。我只是觉得这个Shopify的事情需要让大家知道。

**Tanner:** 是的，谢谢你，坦纳。回头聊。

**Amit:** 好的，回头聊。

### 市场展望与总结

好的，坦纳很兴奋。他对SoFi很兴奋。对特斯拉不是最兴奋的，但特斯拉现在是425美元。仍然试图在当天转为上涨。除了特斯拉，几乎所有东西都在上涨。英伟达也创下日内新高，182美元。标普指数也在670点的水平上徘徊。

<p class="english-text">All right, Tanner's excited. He's excited for SoFi. Not the most excited for Tessy, but Tessy right here, 425. Still trying to go green on the day. You got pretty much everything going green except Tessy. Nvidia high of day as well, 182. And you got the S&P chilling out at that 670 level as well.</p>
