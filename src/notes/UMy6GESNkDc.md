title: 尤尔根·克洛普：我的领导力哲学与打造冠军团队的秘诀
summary: 著名足球教练尤尔根·克洛普分享了他独特的领导力哲学。他强调，成功的关键在于深入理解并因材施教地对待每一位球员，而非采用一刀切的管理方式。克洛普回顾了从球员到顶级教练的历程，阐述了如何将来自不同文化背景的个体融合成一个“愿为彼此赴汤蹈火”的团队。他分享了从失败中学习的重要性，并解释了离开利物浦是因精力耗尽，而非对球队失去信心。这篇访谈为任何领域的领导者提供了宝贵的经验。

### 引言：离开的决定与成功的本质

那是一段紧张的时期。我们必须赢得足球比赛，但所有其他事情也都压在了我的肩上。我需要休息。但在这一行，你无法这么做。你不能说：“给我一年时间，回头见。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was an intense time. We had to win football games, but all the rest was on my plate as well. I need a break. And you cannot do that in that business. You cannot say, "Give me a year. See you later."</p>
</details>

主持人：所以这就引出了一个问题，你认为你还能回去再次执教利物浦吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it begs the question, do you think you could ever go back and manage Liverpool again?</p>
</details>

克洛普：有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's possible.</p>
</details>

主持人：那么，需要什么条件呢？你改变了一家俱乐部，改变了一座城市，你在俱乐部功能失调的时期到来，带领它重返辉煌。你一次又一次地做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what would it take? Yeah, you change a club, you change the city, and you arrived at a time when clubs were in a period of dysfunction to bring that club back to its glory. And you do that over and over and over again.</p>
</details>

克洛普：要在决定性的时刻取胜，你必须是最好的球队。而要成为最好的球队，每个人都必须全身心投入，共同赴汤蹈火。我如何让人们愿意赴汤蹈火？我最好从头说起。成长过程中，我妈妈非常体贴，她热爱人们；而我爸爸则对我寄予厚望。问题在于，我在大多数事情上都一无是处。即使是足球，我的队友也比我强，我认为我只有从始至终全力以赴，才能达到那个水平。我在球场上是一名战士。但这造就了今天的我。所以我的球队踢球风格有点像一支重金属乐队，因为你有90分钟，不能保证得到任何东西，但唯一获得回报的机会就是付出你的全部。所以你想要获得最大的成功，就不要浪费时间有所保留。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How to win in a very decisive moment, you have to be the best team. And to be the best team, everybody has to buy into that team and walk through fire together. How do I get people to walk through fire? I better go back to the start. Growing up, my mom was very caring. She loved people and my dad had expectations. The problem was I was absolutely useless in most of the things. Even with football, my teammates were better than me and I thought I only can get on that level from the first until last minute. I was a warrior on the pitch. But it made me the guy I am today. And so my team plays a little bit more like a heavy metal band because you have 90 minutes and there's no guarantee to get anything but the only chance to get something is to give your all. So you want to have the maximum success. Don't waste time with holding back.</p>
</details>

### 成长经历：严父与慈母的塑造

主持人：为了理解你这个人，以及你在职业生涯中成为并至今仍是的那个非凡人物，我需要了解你最早的成长环境。你能否为我指出，那段早期的经历是如何塑造了今天这个众人皆知的你的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To understand you and the man and the anomaly that you went on to be in your career and still are. What do I need to understand about your very earliest context where you came from and how can you point out to me how that very early context created the person you are today and that everybody knows you to be.</p>
</details>

克洛普：我想我们之所以成为现在的自己，都是因为我们成长的环境。我父亲是一名销售员，我母亲来自一个家庭，我外公拥有一家啤酒厂，她在那里工作，诸如此类。但她唯一的重心就是她的孩子们。她爱我胜过爱自己的生命，这是肯定的。而我父亲则对我寄予厚望。他也爱我，但他有期望，而我母亲没有。所以，我母亲只要我存在就感到高兴，而我父亲总有些地方不那么满意。我父亲希望我做的所有事情，我都喜欢做。他希望我成为一个体育健将。每项运动，网球、滑雪、足球，都是他的生命。所以他希望他的儿子在这方面表现出色，而且他自己也热爱这些运动。如果我，比如说，整天坐在家里画画之类的，他每天都会把我带出去，说：“到外面去玩点什么。”但很快，当我变得更好时，却总是不够好。他总是这样，这就是我成长的过程。这就是他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we all are who we are because the environment we we grew up. My dad was a salesman and my mom came from a family and my grandpa had a brewery and she worked there blah blah blah and all this kind of things. So, but her only purpose was her kids. She loved me more than her own life definitely. And my dad had expectations. He loved me as well, but he had expectations where my mom didn't. So, my mom was just happy that I was there and my dad had always something um where he was not really happy with. And all the things my dad wanted me to do, I love doing. So, he wanted me to to to to be a sports guy. each sport, tennis, skiing, football, that was his life. So he wanted that his son is good at that and he loved doing it. If I would have been, I don't know, sitting at home and and drawing or whatever, he would every day take me out and say, "Go outside and and and and play something." But then pretty quick when I became better, it was never good enough. And he always So that was the process. So that's how I was brought up. That's him.</p>
</details>

主持人：他是个严厉的人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Was he a tough tough man?</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的。不久前我才意识到，我从来没有被他打过，一次也没有。他只是想把我最好的一面激发出来。我想这就是他想要的。在某种程度上很严厉。是的，就像那个时代成长起来的人一样，但并非严厉到让你觉得不想和他有任何瓜葛。不，我非常爱他，他也爱我。他非常自豪，但从不宣之于口。他是个好人，一个真正的好人。但对于他的儿子，他希望他有雄心壮志，有点担心我可能不够有野心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I It's not long ago. I never I never got hit by whatever. Never. Never. Never. He was just He wanted to to bring the best out of me. I think that was what he wanted. Tough in a way. Yeah. how people who are brought up in in that time probably but not tough endless that you thought I do you don't want to have to do anything with him no I loved him to bits and he loved me he was very proud but never never said it and these kind of things so was he was a good guy a real good guy but with his son he wanted him to be ambitious and was a bit afraid that I might be not ambitious enough so</p>
</details>

主持人：我听说他是个好胜的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">competitive man I hear</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah yeah yeah</p>
</details>

主持人：读到一些关于他在滑雪坡上和你赛跑、短跑比赛，并且从不让你赢的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so reading about stories of um him racing you on ski slopes and and sprint races and never letting you win.</p>
</details>

克洛普：那是真的。谁知道这样做对不对。也许是对的。我不知道。从某种程度上说，这并不美好。当你讲述这个故事时，感觉就像，天哪，拜托，让那个可怜的孩子赢一次吧。但你毫无机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's true. Who knows if it was right. Probably it was right. I I don't know. It was not nice in a way. When you tell the story, it's like my god, come on, let the poor boy win or whatever. But you had no chance.</p>
</details>

主持人：回顾你的职业生涯，有没有一些时刻，你会闪回到他教给你的教训、原则或价值观，让你觉得，“天哪，这是我从我父亲那里学到的”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you when you look back over the the course of your career, are there moments where you have flashback to lessons that he taught you or principles or values that he taught you that you think, gosh, I got that from my dad?</p>
</details>

克洛普：我意识到我父亲拥有一项我当时并不知道的技能。他有公开演讲的能力。你不知道自己拥有这个能力，但我有。今天我知道了。我不在乎镜头是否对着我的脸。在那个时刻，我会说我必须说的话，而不太担心别人会怎么想，只要我坚信那是对的。在公共场合讲话不是问题，这可能遗传自他。而我对人的热爱，是无意中从我母亲那里继承的。所以，这种自信的父亲和充满爱心的母亲的结合，就是我成长的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one skill I I realized that my dad had without knowing that time. It was a skill he could speak publicly. You don't know that you have that, but I have it. You today I know it. I I don't care if a camera is in my face or whatever. I say what I have to say in that moment um without being too worried what might people think about it if I'm convinced it's right and I I say talking in public is not a problem it's probably from him my law for people unintentionally that's from my mom so this mix of a very confident and a very caring very confident dad and very caring mom is where I was brought up in the middle of</p>
</details>

### 早年志向：从医生梦到意外的足球生涯

主持人：在那之前你想成为一名医生。所以你的目标是成为一名医生。但没有成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you wanted to be a doctor before before then. So you were aiming to be a doctor. That didn't work out.</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的，那是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's true.</p>
</details>

主持人：为什么？为什么是医生？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why? Why? Why doctor?</p>
</details>

克洛普：不，这一直是我想做的事情。在所有这些美好的成长经历中，很明显钱是个问题。不是说我们没有足够的钱，我们总是有差不多足够的。但我记得关于钱的讨论，不愉快的讨论，可以说是争吵，谁花了这个，谁花了那个。我当时还小，只是坐在旁边听着。但在我生命中的某个时刻，我意识到我必须赚很多钱，这样我才能解决所有问题。我想赚钱，这样就不用和我的妻子或孩子们进行那种讨论。所以，当你还是个年轻人，思考人生可以做什么时，这个想法就萌生了。对我来说，很清楚我不能靠足球赚钱，因为在我看来，我不够好。然后我被一些人惊讶到了，他们认为我身上有些东西可能很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it was always it was something I wanted to do. So in all this wonderful upbringing, it was pretty clear that money is an issue. Not in a sense that we didn't have enough. We always had kind of enough. But I remember discussions, bad discussions about money, arguments if you want, who spent that, who spent that. I was a little one. I just sat around and listened to it. But there was a moment in my life when I when I realized I have to earn a lot of money that I can sort it all. I want to earn money to not having this kind of discussions with my wife or with the kids or whatever. So it grew as a as a as a thought when you are a young man and you think what could you do with life and for me it was clear I cannot earn my money with football because in my mind I wasn't good enough and then I got surprised by some people they thought oh there's something um that could be interesting.</p>
</details>

主持人：他们在你身上看到了什么，作为一个足球运动员？他们在一个年轻人身上看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What did they see in you as a football player? What was it that they they saw in you as a young man?</p>
</details>

克洛普：在我的村子里，我是最好的球员。我进球，我是最快的。所有这些身体上的天赋。我真的很快。后来当我学习体育科学时，我能跳得很远，跳得很高。所有这些。所以我拥有身体上的天赋。职业足球俱乐部的接触真的让我感到惊讶。我没想到会有人来。问题是：“你是上一场比赛的7号吗？”“是的。”“哦，来吧，我们聊聊。你想来法兰克福吗？”这就是当时的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in my village I was the best player in my village. So I scored the goals. I was the fastest. All this kind this physical talent. I was really fast. Later on when I studied sport science I could jump far. I could jump high. All these kind of things. So it was a physical talent. I was literally surprised by the approach from from professional football clubs. I didn't think who's coming. So it was like the question was are you number seven from the game before? Yeah. Oh come on let's have a chat. Do you want to come to Frankfurt? That was the question.</p>
</details>

### 人生转折：20岁成为父亲

克洛普：到法兰克福没多久，我就遇到了马克（我儿子）的妈妈。然后她怀孕了，在88年12月，我成了一位父亲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I it didn't take long that I met Mark's mom. Yeah. Your son's mom. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And then um she got pregnant and um December 88 I became a father.</p>
</details>

主持人：你害怕吗？20岁就当了父亲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Were you scared? 20 years old become a father</p>
</details>

克洛普：非常害怕。当我听说她怀孕时，我想逃跑，心想“哦，天哪，这不是我干的”。所以，当我意识到我将要成为父亲的那一刻，我真的很害怕。1988年12月13日，马克出生的那个晚上，是我成为成年人的夜晚，也是改变我人生走向正确的夜晚。从那一刻起，我总是比同龄人更像一个成年人。他们在上大学，参加派对，我不能去。他们去度假，我不能。我踢着半职业足球，工资很低，在德国第三级别联赛。我还打了另外两份工，一份早上，一份晚上。这教会了我纪律。我在家里没有学到纪律，因为我没有家务活要做。所以我学得晚了点，但这造就了今天的我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">massively. When I heard she's pregnant I was I wanted to run away go oh god it's not me. So the moment when I when I got aware of the fact that I will be a dad, I was really scared. The night 13th December of December 1988 when Mark was born was the night when I became an adult and the night who changed my life in the right direction. From that moment on, I was always more an adult than all the other people in the in my age group. So they were the university, they were on parties, I couldn't go. They went on holiday. I couldn't I played football, low wages, third division Germany. Had two other jobs, one in the morning, one at night. Um and and playing semi-professional football. That taught me the discipline. I didn't have to learn at home because I had no no jobs to do in the house. So I got it a bit later but um it made me the guy I am today.</p>
</details>

### 领导力哲学：因材施教，绝非一视同仁

主持人：因为那段经历，当你自己成为一名主教练时，那是否成为了你理解所管理球员的个人参照点？因为如果你管理一个21岁的父亲和一个没有孩子的21岁球员，你是否会认为他们是不同的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because of that experience when you became a manager yourself did that become a bit of a personal reference point to understand the individuals that you were managing? Because if you were managing a 21-year-old dad versus a 21-year-old that didn't have kids, did you understand them to be different?</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的，当然。我喜欢与人交往，而且我超级好奇。每个人都有一个故事要讲，所以我想听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, of course. I I I don't, but I say I like people and I'm super curious. Everybody has a story to tell, so I want to hear it.</p>
</details>

主持人：我听说弗格森爵士更喜欢有女朋友或妻儿的球员。我想知道这是否有道理，他们是否因此有不同的稳定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I think I asked that question in part cuz I heard stories that Sir Alex Ferguson would prefer players who had a girlfriend or a wife and kids. And I was I was wondering if there's any truth to that, if they have a different stability or</p>
</details>

克洛普：哦，这可能是真的。这其中有很多问题。你可以有一个很棒的伴侣，无论结婚与否，一切都很好。如果伴侣不对，那就不好。没有伴侣对某些人来说不好，有太多伴侣也不好。所以生活中有太多变数。我从未想过这个问题。…… 这只是个性的一部分，但不是压倒性的或最决定性的因素。在足球比赛中，你也需要那些狡黠的、街头智慧型的球员。你需要他们，那些能在生活和球场上摆脱困境的人。所以这是一个融合体。这就是我喜欢足球队的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, it's probably Yeah. There are couple problems you can you can have a great partner married or not and then everything is fine. It's the wrong partner it's not great. You have no partner not great for some and you have too many it's not great. So there are so many things in life. So I haven't never I never thought about that. ... that's not that's one part of of the personality but not the overwhelming or the the most decisive or whatever. So, it's like and you need on the football is a football game. You need the cheeky the cheeky ones as well. So you need them the one who the street smart you need as well they get out of situations in life and on the pitch stuff like this. So it's a mix of everything. That's what I loved about football teams.</p>
</details>

克洛普：我对待他们的方式，可以说50%的时间是完全相同的，另外50%则根据他需要什么、他需要什么、他需要什么来定，而且是在其他队友面前。所以有球员来找我问，你为什么那样对我？你绝不会那样对他说话。我说，不，因为他来自阿根廷，在没有窗户的环境中长大，而你来自慕尼黑，一切都很好。你真的想让我像对待他一样对待你吗？要把这些来自世界不同地区的人聚集在一起，你不能期望他们都以同样的方式思考。这根本不可能。在德国长大显然和在塞内加尔长大是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I treated them let me say 50% of the time completely the same and 50% what he needs what he needs what he needs but in front of the other teammates. So people, players came to me, why do you um treat me like that? You would have ne would never say that to him. No, because he's from Argentina, grew up without a window and you are from Munich and everything was fine. You want me to treat you like him? Really? To bring all these people from different areas in the world together, you cannot expect that they all tick the same way. It's just not possible. Growing up in Germany is obviously different to growing up in Seneagal. It is different.</p>
</details>

克洛普：你想要一支充满不同技能、不同天赋、不同个性的足球队。你想要这样，因为这就是你所需要的，这让你变得不可预测。但如果你只是给他们套上一个统一的头盔，说这就是你们所有人的规矩，我们就是这样做的。在比赛的某些时刻，他们必须那样做。但在所有其他时刻，他们必须做自己。所以要那样对待他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You want a um a football team full of different skill sets, full of different talent, full of different personality. want that because that's what you need. That what makes you unpredictable. But then you put just one I don't know helmet over it and say so that's for all of you. That's how we go. There are moments in the game where they have to act like that. In all the other in all the other moments they have to be themselves. So treat them like that.</p>
</details>

主持人：这是我从其他教练，特别是弗格森爵士的前球员那里听到的最令人震惊、最反直觉的想法之一。他们都说他对待人是不同的。现在听到你也这么说，这真的与你在商界听到的相反。在商界，你听到的是你必须是一个始终如一的领导者，你必须保持一致，平等对待每个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is one of the most shocking, counterintuitive um ideas that I've that that that I heard from players with other managers specifically cuz I've just interviewed so many of Sar Alex Ferguson's former players. One of the shocking things they all said was that he treated people differently. And to hear you say the same thing as well, it it it really is the opposite of what you hear in business. In business, you hear that you have to be a consistent leader, that you have to be consistent, treat people the same.</p>
</details>

克洛普：我认为在商界，在生活中，都是一样的。领导的第一件事是领导自己。所以早上你起床，你必须踢自己的屁股说，加油，今天不是最好的一天，但无论如何我们都要继续。然后对于你领导的人，你需要去理解他们才能做得好。这意味着你和他们交谈，你倾听他们，你问他们来自哪里，背景是什么，等等。所以，在对话中就已经很清楚，他和另一个人是不同的。这与守时之类的规则无关，而是关于如果你一视同仁地对待他们，怎么可能激发出他们最好的一面？这太疯狂了。对我来说，从个体的实际位置出发，而不是从你希望他达到的位置出发，这一点至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I think in business in life it's the same. So to lead that's one number one thing you lead yourself so that's the first one in the morning you stand up you have to kick your own but say come on it's not the greatest day but anyhow we go and then then the people you lead you need to understand to do it properly. So now that means you you you talk to them, you listen to them, you ask them where are you from, what's your background, what are we doing here and there blah blah and why did you that and stuff like this. So it means it's already in that conversation it's clear he's different to the other guy. It's not about the rules like punctuality early in late out not about these kind of things but how can we get the best out of people if you treat them all the same? It's it's crazy. For me, it's super important that you really pick the individual from where it stands, not from where you want it to be. No, actually where it actually is.</p>
</details>

### 领导者的职责：明确目标，倾听需求

克洛普：领导者的工作是让目标、目的、最终目的地像太阳一样清晰，让每个人都自动地朝着那里前进，而你不需要每天推着他们说，顺便说一下，路标在那边。在通往目标的路上，你以不同的方式支持他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the job of a leader is to make the target the aim the final destination whatever that clear like the sun that everybody's automatically going there and you don't have to push them every day and say by the way there's the sign that's around there so that that they know it on the way there you support them in different in different ways</p>
</details>

克洛普：在与依赖你、你对其负责的人交谈时，重要的不是你说什么，更重要的是他们需要听到什么。这不是告诉他们想听的话，不，是他们需要听到什么来处理他们的处境。这就是领导力的意义所在，而不仅仅是责备他们。那行不通。试着去理解为什么。我热爱我工作中的这一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's not so important what you say it's much more important what they need to hear it's not them telling them what they want to hear no what they need to hear to deal with their situation so that's what leadership means not just telling them off for whatever that doesn't work that doesn't work try to understand why and that was I I love that part in my job</p>
</details>

主持人：你的团队里有没有某些球员你觉得可以对他们更严厉，而另一些球员你觉得永远不能对他们太严厉，因为那会损害他们的表现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Was there certain players in your team that you felt you could be tougher with and others that you felt you could never really be tough with because that would make that would hurt their performance.</p>
</details>

克洛普：当然，当然有。萨迪奥·马内和莫·萨拉赫就是两个最好的例子。…… 要想作为一支足球队取得成功，你必须组织球队以获得稳定性。要获得稳定性，你需要找到一种方式来正确地、共同地防守。有了这个基础，他们才能开始飞翔。…… 我和他们谈了很多，我们谈论的方式非常明确。你想赢的次数比输的次数多。你想获得最大的成功。你想有朝一日成为英格兰最好的球队。是的。好吧，那就去做。来吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Of of course of course you have the Sadio Mani and and and Mosala are two top examples. So to be successful as a football team you have to organize a football team to get stability. To get stability you need to find a way to defend properly and together. If you have that based on that they can start flying then we then let's talk about the football part. So and now there are obviously no defenders but we were famous for our pressing and counter pressing. I talked a lot to them and it was and the the way we spoke about it was just 100% clear. You want to win more often than not. You want to have the maximum success. You want to be able to become the best team in England at one point. Yeah. Okay then do that. Come on.</p>
</details>

### 从球员到教练：在美因茨的崛起

主持人：你最终成为了美因茨的主教练。你得到那份工作时和我现在的年龄差不多，前任主教练被解雇了。俱乐部从未进入过**德甲**（Bundesliga: 德国足球甲级联赛）。你之前没有管理这么大规模俱乐部的经验。主席来找你，老板来找你，说他们希望你来做这份工作。他们为什么希望你来做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You eventually become the manager of mines. Yeah, you're my age when you get that job and the the former manager's been sacked. The club have never gotten to the Bundesliga, the the first division in Germany. You don't have experience managing a club of this size or scale previously. The chairman comes to you, the owner comes to you and says they want you to do the job. Why did they want you to do the job?</p>
</details>

克洛普：因为他们在短时间内找不到其他人了。我们周日比赛，下一场比赛是周三。最初的想法只是执教那一场比赛。…… 他们打电话给我，问我能不能接手那场比赛，我说可以。我接手了，我们赢了比赛，他们也没找到新的主教练。所以我们周日还有其他比赛，第一场我们1-0赢了，第二场3-1赢了。前七场比赛我们赢了六场，平了一场。所以我们相当轻松地保级了。

<details>

克洛普：我们曾拥有过我们所有人都认为最好的教练，沃尔夫冈·弗兰克。他非常出色。…… 他来了之后，实施了四后卫、球导向防守。我们只做这个。我们一夜之间变成了任何对手都不想遇到的球队。我们就像机器一样。…… 沃尔夫冈离开后，没有其他教练能做到这一点。我和他之后的教练没有任何联系。我是从沃尔夫冈·弗兰克那里受益匪浅的球员之一，现在我来了，我仅有的两次训练课，都完全是关于4-4-2阵型和球导向跑动。

We did nothing else than that. And we changed overnight into the one opponent nobody wanted to play against. We were like machines. ... Then Wolfkang left and none of the other coaches could do that. None. There was no connection to the coaches after Wolffrang. So I was one of the players who benefited massively from Wolffkang Frank and now I arrived and the only thing I did when I the two sessions I had were both exactly about that 44 for two ball orientated movements</p>
</details>

克洛普：我喜欢找到一个理由，说明为什么在这样的时刻我们付出绝对的全部是有意义的。为什么我们不只投入最少，而是投入最多？为什么如果我们不这样做就会后悔？如果我们这样做了，生活会好多少？做这件事会多有趣？我热爱这些时刻。…… 从那一刻起，再也没有人想和我们比赛了。我们就像，哇，野兽一样。那是一段很棒的时光。同一支球队，几乎没变，一夜之间就改变了。

I told them and from that moment on nobody wanted to play against us anymore. So like we were like wow animals. It was great. It was a fantastic time.

### 信念的力量：如何让球员飞翔

主持人：确保你职业生涯中的球员对自己有信心，这件事有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important did that prove to be this idea of making sure that the players you have throughout your career had belief in themselves?</p>
</details>

克洛普：这就是一切的关键。不仅仅是足球，生活也是如此。…… 当然，相信自己是有道理的，但不是每个人都能做到。但如果你遇到一个能帮助你的人，一个有远见、能看到你身上闪光点的人，那就告诉他们。为什么要藏在心里？“天哪，我觉得他是个天才，她是个天才，她擅长这个，他擅长那个。”是的。我们为什么不互相告诉对方呢？有什么问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's all it's all about that. It's not football. It's life. ... of course it makes sense you believe in yourself but not everybody can do that. So if but then if you meet somebody who helps you with that who has a perspective who can see something in you yeah then tell tell them why you should keep it for yourself. Oh my god I think he's a talent she's a talent whatever she's good at that he's good at that. Yeah. Why we don't tell each other? So where's the problem?</p>
</details>

克洛普：我试着创造一种情境，确保球员们……如果他们还没有信心，他们会变得有信心。但你知道，总有他们失去信心的时候。信心就像一朵小花，总有人踩在上面。…… 我会说，如果你能像我一样相信你自己，那将是一个开始。但只要你还做不到，就相信我。你很优秀，因为我不和不优秀的人合作。我不浪费时间。这是真的。我真的看到了一些东西，如果我看到了，我就有足够的耐心去培养它。…… 当然，我的想法是有一天我能帮你学会飞翔，但最终，你必须自己飞。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I try to create a situation to make sure that the player if if they are not confident yet they are confident but you know there are moments when they lose it confidence is like described it once as a little flower and constantly somebody steps on it ... if you would believe as much in yourself as I do that will be a start. But as long as you cannot do that just trust me. So you are good because I don't work with not with other I don't waste time. And it's true. I don't. So, I really I really see something and if I see it, I'm patient enough to work on it. ... But of course, the the idea is that that one day I help you learn flying, but in the end, you have to fly yourself. Obviously, I cannot I cannot do that for you.</p>

### 从失败中学习：这是最重要的信息

克洛普：在赢得那场比赛之前，我学会了如何输。这非常重要。我想说，我认为这又是一次学习。即使你想尽可能地成功，你也必须接受你有时会输。然后，如果你继续前进，如果你能从中学习，你就有很好的机会。一次失败，如果你不从中学习，它就只是一次失败。如果你从中学习，它就是一条非常非常重要的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But before winning that I I learned how to lose. This is very important. I would say I think that's again to learn even though you want to be as successful as somehow possible you have to accept that from time to time you lose and then keep then when you then keep going you have a good chance if you learn from it a defeat is a defeat if you don't learn from it if you learn from it it's a very very important information</p>
</details>

主持人：杰米·卡拉格问我，他说你职业生涯中有很多次“差一点就成功”的经历，无论是在**欧冠**（Champions League: 欧洲冠军联赛）还是和曼城争夺联赛冠军时只差一分。他的问题是，他对你如何处理这种“差一点”的失望情绪感到着迷，因为有时这种经历会摧毁一个人。但纵观你的职业生涯，这些“差一点”的经历最终都变成了你的积极力量。

<p class="english-text">When I spoke to Jamie Carrager, I I asked Jamie Carrager actually this earlier this morning. I said I said to him, you know, what what was he curious about with you? And this is actually what he said. He said there were so many near misses in your career, whether it was in the Champions League or I remember when you were headto-head with Man City that in that season and you were one point shy of winning the league. And his question was, he's fascinated with how you you were so good at dealing with the disappointment of near misses because sometimes near misses can people. They can turn them into a downward spiral. ... But it appears through your career that near misses ended up being positive forces for you.</p>
</details>

克洛普：塑造我的是这些人，当然还有我的妈妈、爸爸，以及我的信仰。我一直知道我来这里不是为了得到一切，而是为了付出一切。…… 我不认为自己是一个持续的赢家。我认为自己是一个持续的尝试者。…… 生活就是处理你想要却得不到的东西，然后你要么更想要它，要么不再想要。那些时刻并不美好，但我在这里学到了。如果得不到你想要的结果，再试一次，更努力地尝试。

I see myself as a constant tryer. ... it's all about dealing with the things you want and not get and then you want it more and or or not anymore or whatever. So, the moments were not great, but I learned it here. ... If you don't get the result you want, try again and try harder.</p>

### 利物浦时代：为何选择安菲尔德而非老特拉福德

主持人：曼联有没有打过电话？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">did did Manchester United ever call?</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的，是的，我和他们谈过。在弗格森爵士退休那年，他们和我谈过。是的，他们当然在某个时候感兴趣。…… 那对我来说是错误的时间，错误的时刻。我在多特蒙德有合同，我不会离开。真的，为了任何人我都不会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, I spoke to them. So in the year when Alex retired, they they spoke to me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course they were interested at one point. ... It was wrong time, wrong moment for me. I I was in had a contract at Dortmund. I wouldn't have left. Not really for for for nobody in that time.</p>
</details>

主持人：所以是你拒绝了曼联，而不是曼联拒绝了你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it was you that turned down Manchester United, not Manchester United turning you down.</p>

克洛普：是的，可以这么说。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. That way. So I Yeah. So</p>
</details>

主持人：为什么像曼联这样通常被称为世界最大俱乐部的球队，你没有接受那份工作？

<details>

<p class="english-text">why why would a guy like Manchester United's often known as the biggest club in the world? Why wouldn't you take that job? Why didn't you take that job?</p>
</details>

克洛普：我们现在不是在私人空间。那次谈话中的人告诉我的一些原因，我不喜欢。…… 曼联当时非常强大。我们想要的所有球员都能得到。我们就像，我们可以得到他，得到他，得到他。我坐在那里。那不是我的项目。感觉不像我的项目。那是个错误的时间，但最重要的是，那不是我的项目。…… 那不是关于足球。完全不是。我坐在那里，心想，“不，我不确定。这不适合我。”然后，一个纯粹的足球项目出现了，那就是利物浦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is typical. We are now not in private in a private space. So there are some reasons what the people in that conversation told me which I didn't like. ...

It didn't feel like my it was a wrong time but on top of that it was not my project. ... It wasn't about the football. It was No, not at all. And I sat there and was like, "Nah, I'm not sure. That's not for me." So, and then the pure pure football project comes up with with Liverpool</p>

### 重建文化：从怀疑者到信仰者

<details>

<p class="english-text">What what did you observe when you arrived? What was the culture? What was the feeling? And what was your first thought about what you had to do to to to bring that club back to its glory?</p>

克洛普：我说过，没有人喜欢这支球队。甚至球队自己都不喜欢自己。…… 我喜欢这支球队。我了解球员们。…… 我知道亨德森、米尔纳和拉拉纳。我知道很多球员，只听说过足够好的事情，心想，好吧，让我们看看。所以，我喜欢这支球队。那是一支足球队，真正的足球，态度超级好。

</details>

克洛普：我必须做的第一件事就是组织他们。找到一种方法，让他们明白我们有机会赢得下一场足球比赛。为此我们必须做几件事。…… 我们从一种有组织的混乱开始。我给了他们一些关于我们想在哪里给他们施加压力的想法，然后在那个时刻，就去做。之后我们再讨论效果如何，因为没有时间训练。

<details>

<p class="english-text">the first thing I had to sort is like to organize them so find a way to make sure that they understand that we have chance to win the next football game.

So I gave them a few ideas about where we have to where we want to put them under pressure and in that moment now do it. And afterwards we work we talk about it how it worked out because there was no time to train.</p>
</details>

克洛普：如果你想改变什么，你必须向人们展示。你必须向人们展示你想要实现什么。我怎么能告诉他们呢？我可以告诉他们，但最终你必须展示给他们看。所以，跑起来。他们全力以赴，我非常喜欢。他们也非常喜欢。这很简单。他们都身体素质顶尖，他们想跑。所以只要告诉他们方向，他们就会去做。然后我们一步步发展出我们自己的足球风格。

### “重金属足球”的哲学

主持人：你以所谓的“重金属足球”而闻名。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you're known for what they call heavy metal football.</p>
</details>

克洛普：是的，我知道。他们问我关于阿尔塞纳·温格的比较，他们认为我们在某种程度上相似，我心想，什么？…… 如果你想比较我们，那我不确定是否可能，因为阿尔塞纳的足球更像一个管弦乐队，而我的球队踢得更像一支重金属乐队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, but that's Yeah, I know. They asked me about Asen Mena on the comparison and they they think we are similar in a way and I thought what ... if you want to compare us then I'm not sure that's possible because Azen's football is rather like an orchestra and my team plays a little bit more like a heavy metal band</p>
</details>

主持人：但这是真的。作为曼联球迷，我比任何人都清楚这一点。我讨厌和你的球队比赛，因为他们跑动太多，充满激情，从不松懈。他们总能在最后一分钟赢球，那种强度让你作为一个球迷在看比赛时感到焦虑，因为那太激烈了，几乎让人在情感上不知所措。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's true. Yes, somehow. It is true. And I know that more than anyone as a Manchester United fan watching. I'd hate playing your football teams because they they ran so much. They were so passionate. They never let up. They would they could always win in the last minute and the intensity was you were just anxious as a as a football fan watching the games because it was so fullon and it was overwhel. It's almost overwhelming emotionally.</p>
</details>

克洛普：不要浪费时间有所保留。我不理解。我们有90分钟，95分钟，随便多久。…… 你必须明白，这场比赛之所以对我们如此有趣，是因为所有的人都在观看。这就是我们赚钱的原因。我是认真的。…… 我们真正需要做的唯一一件事，就是在这样的比赛中付出你的全部。

<details>

### 利物浦之道：理解社区，承担责任

<details>

克洛普：你必须理解这个社区，包括作为城市社区和遍布全球的更广泛社区。有这么多人，这家俱乐部经历了很多。…… 你必须理解和学习的是，这家俱乐部对人们的意义远不止足球。所以你必须明白，我们所做的事情比在其他地方可能更重要。这就是我们一直承担并百分之百理解的责任。我们的球员们明白，为利物浦效力不仅仅是你职业生涯中的一家俱乐部，它是“那家”俱乐部，是你一生中绝对会铭记的事情。

<p class="english-text">Why did you leave? Why did you leave Liverpool? I I watched your videos announcing your departure so many times and I was almost trying to read between the lines.</p>

克洛普：我对自己的期望是，我必须是这个环境中每个人的能量给予者。…… 我必须处于我比赛的绝对顶峰，才能成为那个配得上利物浦主教练的人。这就是我说的，当我感觉到“嗯，我不再是了”的那一天，我就不会再做了。…… 我意识到我需要休息。我需要一些别的东西。但在这一行你不能这么做。你不能说：“先生们女士们，给我一年时间，回头见。”

I realized I need a break, whatever. I need to have something else. And you cannot do that in that business. You cannot say, "Ladies and gentlemen, give me a year. See you later."</p>
</details>

克洛普：有一段时间，没有理查德，没有迈克尔，没有朱利安·沃德。只有我一个人坐在那里，处理所有的事情。我们必须赢得足球比赛，但所有其他事情也都压在了我的肩上。那是一段紧张的时期。

克洛普：我甚至不确切知道。我热爱我现在做的事情。我不想念执教。…… 我58岁了，从你的角度看很老，从其他角度看没那么老。这意味着我可能在几年后做出决定。我不知道。我今天必须做决定吗？我不会再执教了。但谢天谢地，我不需要这么做。我只需看看未来会带来什么。

克洛普：你必须创造一种文化，一种环境，一种氛围，让每个人都意识到这是特别的。潜在的信息是，这是特别的，现在让我们为此奋斗。这是值得的。这对我们所有人的意义远不止于此，所以我们真的可以为此付出更多。…… 我们在训练场与厨房员工、装备管理员、场地管理员以及所有人的互动方式，我们每天展现的尊重，这对我来说最重要。因为你展现的尊重就是你得到的尊重。

克洛普：我相信，如果你连这点都做不到，如果你不欣赏别人所做的事情，那么你就无法欣赏你队友所做的事情。这只是一个小小的迹象。…… 我对足球队的总体理解是，要成为你能成为的最好的足球队。这一点和战术一样重要。和战术一样重要。他们可以有最好的战术，但球员们不尊重、不喜欢彼此，没有人会看到这些战术的威力。永远不会。如果战术最差，但他们彼此相爱，天哪，他们仍然可以赢。这是可能的。
