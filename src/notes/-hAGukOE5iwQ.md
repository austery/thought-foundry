### 能源生产与许可流程

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Did you talk about permitting changes that you could make now that would lower the break even cost of oil to allow producers to keep pumping and keep making money?

你们是否谈论了现在可以进行的许可变更，以降低石油的盈亏平衡成本，从而让生产商能够继续生产并保持盈利？

We did. We did. You know, we heard a litany of delays of of uncertainty about whether they could get permits, whether they could do this or whether they could do that. So, we were in listening mode and heard a number of things.

我们谈了。我们谈了。我们听到了大量关于他们是否能获得许可、是否能做这件事或那件事的延迟和不确定性。所以，我们处于倾听模式，并听取了许多意见。

And our message was the goal of this administration. President Trump got elected to increase American energy production. More supply means lower costs, more jobs, more opportunities, and more geopolitical power. So we we were in listening mode, but absolutely said we want to we want to be helpful to unleash American energy.

我们的信息是本届政府的目标。特朗普总统当选是为了增加美国的能源产量。更多的供应意味着更低的成本、更多的就业机会、更多的机遇以及更多的地缘政治力量。所以，我们处于倾听模式，但绝对表示我们希望并且愿意帮助释放美国的能源潜力。

### CEO们对关税的担忧

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
Secretary, when you talk about listening mode, last week I was at Sarah Week by S&P Global in Houston, as were you, and I listened when many CEOs said they had concerns about tariffs. Did you address some of that yesterday at the White House?

部长先生，当您谈到倾听模式时，上周我在休斯顿参加了标普全球的“莎拉周”活动，您也去了，我听到许多首席执行官表示对关税感到担忧。您昨天在白宫是否谈及了其中一些问题？

Tariffs wasn't discussed at the meeting. It was more a broader unleash American energy and all that. We actually didn't get into the tariff dialogue.

会议中没有讨论关税问题。那更多的是关于更广泛地释放美国能源等等。我们实际上没有深入讨论关税。

What would you suggest then to energy producers who are concerned if if not about the the lasting impact of tariffs, some of the confusion that has surrounded this conversation, Mr. Secretary, you've seen the market reaction and this is a reality for every business owner.

那么，您会向那些对关税的长期影响感到担忧，或者对围绕此次对话的困惑感到担忧的能源生产商提出什么建议呢，部长先生？您看到了市场的反应，而这对于每一位企业主来说都是现实。

It is. It is. Look, the the president's got a vision. He's got a bold agenda and it's being created right now. So, there's negotiations with multiple countries. Think of his overwhelming goal. He wants reciprocal trade. If a country has high tariffs on us, he wants them to lower their tariffs on us and he'll be he'll match that reciprocally.

确实如此。确实如此。你看，总统有他的愿景。他有一个大胆的议程，并且正在被创造出来。所以，正在与多个国家进行谈判。想想他压倒性的目标。他想要互惠贸易。如果一个国家对我们征收高额关税，他希望他们降低对我们的关税，而他也会相应地匹配。

So, these are negotiations that need to go back and forth. So, I understand the uncertainty. Um, we all feel it. We all see it, but I think it's a negotiation going to a great place, but we won't have clarity. I think it won't be that long, but we're not there yet.

所以，这些是需要来回进行的谈判。因此，我理解这种不确定性。嗯，我们都感受到了。我们都看到了，但我认为这是一场走向良好结果的谈判，但我们还没有清晰的局面。我认为不会太久，但我们还没有到那一步。

### 战略石油储备的充实计划

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
I do want to ask you a question about our reporting that you will seek up to $20 billion to accomplish the president's goal of refilling the nation's oil reserve. Obviously, you'll have to go to Congress on that. Have you done that? And what will you do about that moving forward in Washington DC?

我确实想问您一个关于我们报道的问题，即您将寻求高达 200 亿美元来完成总统充实国家石油储备的目标。显然，您需要为此去国会。您这样做过吗？在华盛顿特区，您将如何处理此事？

Yes, it it's a critical in our ask and in our agenda. You know, that the strategic petroleum reserve is for just that. It's to be strategic safety and security in the event of very bad world events. They may never happen. We hope they don't. It's like insurance. But you've got to be prepared for anything.

是的，这是我们请求中的关键，也是我们议程中的关键。您知道，战略石油储备就是为此目的。它旨在在发生非常糟糕的国际事件时提供战略性的安全保障。这些事件可能永远不会发生。我们希望它们不会发生。这就像保险。但你必须为任何事情做好准备。

We've got to have our country secure and safe no matter what happens with energy because if you get energy wrong, nothing else matters. So yes, we were we're going to Congress to get money for that.

我们必须确保我们的国家无论在能源方面发生什么都能安全可靠，因为如果你在能源方面出了问题，其他一切都无关紧要。所以是的，我们正前往国会为之争取资金。

Sadly, it takes much longer to refill the strategic petroleum reserve than it took to drain it for political reasons, not strategic reasons in the 2022 midterm elections. So, it's a multi-year process to fill it, but uh we want to get going as soon as we can. We talked about that last time you joined us from Port Sulfur.

可悲的是，与在 2022 年中期选举中出于政治而非战略原因耗尽战略石油储备相比，充实战略石油储备需要更长的时间。所以，这是一个多年的充实过程，但我们希望尽快开始。上次您从波特硫磺加入我们时，我们就谈到了这一点。

Secretary, just quickly before we move on, do you know how soon you can make your first bid on oil, the first batch to refill the SPR?

部长先生，在我们继续之前，您能快速告诉我，您知道多久可以对石油进行第一次竞标，以充实 SPR 吗？

Uh, I suspect in that, you know, that's that's up to Congress. So, the Congress is going through a process now, though.

嗯，我怀疑，你知道，这取决于国会。所以，国会现在正在进行一个程序。

Or do you want to see $50 crude before you make that that move? Oh, no. We we we would happily we're not going to guess the price of oil and all that, we would happily buy crude right now. Um, obviously, if we see spikes higher or huge dislocations, we might stop buying crude. But, uh, no, if we if we had the approval right now, we'd be in the market today.

或者您想在采取行动前看到每桶 50 美元的原油价格？哦，不。我们很乐意，我们不会去猜测石油价格什么的，我们现在就很乐意购买原油。嗯，很明显，如果我们看到价格飙升或巨大的市场混乱，我们可能会停止购买原油。但是，嗯，不，如果我们现在就获得批准，我们今天就会进入市场。

### 乌克兰矿产协议的前景

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
President Trump, Mr. secretary reintroduced the prospect of a minerals deal with Ukraine today. This is what he said. I'd love to get your reaction. We're also signing agreements in various locations to unlock uh rare earths and minerals and lots of other things all over the world, but uh in particular Ukraine. We're doing very well with regard to Ukraine and Russia. And one of the things we are doing is signing a deal very shortly with respect to rare earths with Ukraine which they have tremendous value in rare earth and we appreciate that.

特朗普总统，部长先生，今天重新提出了与乌克兰达成矿产协议的可能性。他说：“我希望能得到您的回应。我们还在世界各地各个地方签署协议，以开发稀土和矿产以及许多其他东西，尤其是在乌克兰。我们在乌克兰和俄罗斯方面进展顺利。我们正在做的一件事是，很快将与乌克兰签署一项关于稀土的协议，乌克兰拥有巨大的稀土价值，我们对此表示赞赏。”

Got everyone's antennas up today Mr. Secretary. What are you hearing about this? How quickly could it happen?

今天引起了大家的关注，部长先生。您对此有什么看法？它多久能实现？

Uh I think a deal could be done quickly. It's a brilliant idea when you think about it that we often use this misnomer term natural resources. Those resources have been underground for millions of years and they haven't benefited anyone. I call them natural materials. They only become resources when technology, capital, and human activity brings them out of the ground and turns them into resources.

嗯，我认为这项协议可以很快达成。当你仔细想想，我们经常使用“自然资源”这个不恰当的术语。这些资源在地底下已经存在了数百万年，但从未给任何人带来利益。我称它们为“自然材料”。只有当技术、资本和人类活动将它们从地下开采出来并将其转化为资源时，它们才成为资源。

But to have the United States as your partner to develop materials that have been sitting there for a long time unused, that's upside to Ukraine. It's upside to the United States. And of course, it's a joining together of the nations in a in an effort on the ground in Ukraine. If I'm Ukraine, I am all in on that deal. And as the American energy secretary, I am all in on that deal.

但是，让美国成为你的合作伙伴，来开发那些长期以来闲置在地下的材料，这对乌克兰来说是巨大的机遇。这对美国来说也是巨大的机遇。当然，这是各国在乌克兰实地共同努力的结果。如果我是乌克兰，我会全力支持这项协议。作为美国能源部长，我也会全力支持这项协议。

### 美国参与乌克兰核电站的可能性

Original English sentence(s) from the transcript.
You know, last night we spoke with retired General Wesley Clark, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander. Here's what he had to say about putting US involvement in energy facilities in Ukraine.

您知道，昨晚我们与退休将军韦斯利·克拉克，前北约最高盟军指挥官进行了交谈。以下是他关于美国参与乌克兰能源设施的看法。

Those are old, what we consider obsolescent nuclear plants. We didn't design those plants. They're not our plants. We can't just transplant transplant people over there and say, "Hey, by the way, uh this is the GE design, go after it." It isn't. But yes, we could learn to take care of those plants. Zaparisia, the plant's been partially occupied by the Russians. Uh they've threatened to to to damage it and destroy it at various times. It wouldn't be such a bad thing if you if the United States says, "Well, now you can't touch it because we're in it."

那些是旧的，我们认为是过时的核电站。我们没有设计那些核电站。它们不是我们的核电站。我们不能 just 调派人员过去说：“嘿，顺便说一句，这是通用电气的（GE）设计，你们去搞吧。”事实并非如此。但是，是的，我们可以学会照顾那些核电站。扎波罗热核电站，该核电站已被俄罗斯部分占领。嗯，他们曾多次威胁要损坏和摧毁它。如果美国说：“嗯，现在你们不能碰它了，因为我们介入了”，那也不是件坏事。

Secretary, your response to that?

部长先生，您对此有何回应？

Yeah, of course there's complexities in everything when you do business offshore overseas. Uh boy, I've done business in countries much more difficult to operate in than Ukraine. But uh you know, of course, the general is right. It's a different plant design, but you would bring local experts that know that plant, and you'd bring high-end nuclear experts from the United States, and together, I think wise decisions would be made. If the political decision is made for the US to lead the operation of that plant, uh, so be it. We could do that, I think, with uh very little problem.

是的，当然，在海外开展业务总会有复杂性。哦，天哪，我曾在比乌克兰更难运营的国家做过生意。但是，嗯，你知道，当然，将军说得对。这是不同的工厂设计，但你会带来了解该工厂的本地专家，并且你会从美国带来高端核专家，我认为在一起，明智的决定将会做出。如果美国做出政治决定要领导该工厂的运营，那么就这么办。我认为我们可以做到，而且问题不大。

Well, Secretary, have you spoken with any American companies that would be interested in buying a plant like Zapperia? And if if this happened, whether it was that or another, would your department regulate it?

好吧，部长先生，您是否与任何有兴趣购买像扎波罗热核电站这样的工厂的美国公司沟通过？如果这种情况发生，无论是那个工厂还是其他工厂，您的部门会进行监管吗？

Uh, no dialogues about that yet. No dialogues about that yet. But America's full of expertise in this area. And boy, I at the Department of Energy have been overwhelmed with people putting their hand in the air and saying, "Put me in. How can I help? What can I do?" So, I I think we would see tremendous interest.

嗯，目前还没有关于这方面的对话。目前还没有关于这方面的对话。但是美国在这个领域拥有丰富的专业知识。哦，天哪，我在能源部已经应接不暇，人们纷纷举手表示：“让我上。我能怎么帮忙？我能做什么？”所以，我认为我们会看到巨大的兴趣。

something needed to be done. We'd have tons of people wanting to do.

需要做些什么。我们会有很多想做的人。
