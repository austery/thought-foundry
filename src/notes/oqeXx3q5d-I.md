### 引言：对杨振宁的评价与核心议题

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说，我是夸克。前两天，103岁的**杨振宁**（Chen-Ning Yang: 著名物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖获得者）去世了。大家可能留意到，我在讲述他的死讯时，用了最基础的叙述方式：没有一堆头衔，没有任何尊称，也没有使用“去世”、“过世”、“仙游”一类较为婉转的说法，就是“某某某死了”。这基本上代表了我对他的态度，也是我对包括**钱学森**（Qian Xuesen: 著名科学家，中国导弹之父）和**邓稼先**（Deng Jiaxian: 著名核物理学家，中国核武器研制者）等一批在**中共**（Chinese Communist Party: 中国执政党）叙事中被极力推崇、褒扬乃至捧上神坛的理工科领域学者们的态度。接下来，我将分成两部分来解释为何我持有这样的态度。前半部分，我将尝试探讨科学与伦理、科学家的个人良知与研究工作之间的关系。节目的后半段，我将应部分网友的要求，仔细讲述杨振宁都做了些什么，然后您可以自行判断我是否应该鄙视他。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says. I am Quark. A couple of days ago, 103-year-old Chen-Ning Yang passed away. You might have noticed that when I spoke of his death, I used the most basic narrative style: no long list of titles, no honorifics, and no euphemisms like 'passed away,' 'departed,' or 'journeyed on.' I simply stated that 'so-and-so died.' This essentially represents my attitude towards him, and towards a group of scholars in the science and engineering fields—including Qian Xuesen and Deng Jiaxian—whom the CCP narrative highly praises, extols, and even elevates to god-like status. Next, I will divide this discussion into two parts to explain why I hold this attitude. In the first half, I will attempt to explore the relationship between science and ethics, a scientist's personal conscience, and their research work. In the latter half of the program, at the request of some netizens, I will elaborate on what Chen-Ning Yang did, and then you can decide for yourself whether I should despise him.</p>

### 科学、道德与良知：普世与环境的差异

我之前在推特和YouTube的帖子里，曾发表过一些我对**杨振宁**等人的看法。在为之辩护的声音中，有一类说法很常见，即“科学是中立的，你不能道德绑架要求科学家做道德完人”。这里，我先解释两句，因为我经常看到有人滥用“道德绑架”这个说法。但杨振宁、**钱学森**乃至**邓稼先**的问题，很大程度上不在于道德，而在于良知。道德和良知都是人类社会和个体精神生活的基础，但两者有着显著区别：道德是和特定环境相关联的，而良知是普世的。不好理解吗？我举个例子，比如“贞洁”这个概念，是前工业时代特别看重的道德标准。在那个道德体系下，一个女生未婚就和人发生了性关系，这叫“失贞”，是能要人命的，对吧？但在今天，这还算个事吗？所以才会有“旧道德”一说，说明道德是很容易变化的，是可以被教育塑造的。但良知就不同了，良知是源于内心深处的。比如“不能强奸”这个事，你放到任何时代都成立，即便你从没受过教育，也知道这是不对的，因为它违反了对方的自由意志。道德和良知有时候是一致的，但也有时候不那么一致，甚至截然相反。例如，按照党特有的道德标准——“党性高于人性，组织纪律高于自由意志，集体主义高于个人利益”——如果你是个士兵，党让你朝学生和老乡们开枪，你就得开，这才是“道德的”、“顾全大局的”，你必须收起你的良知。

<p class="english-text">I previously posted some of my views on Chen-Ning Yang and others on Twitter and YouTube. Among the voices defending them, a common argument is that science is neutral, and you cannot morally blackmail scientists into being moral paragons. Here, I'll explain a couple of points first, because I often see people misuse the term 'moral blackmail.' However, the issues with Chen-Ning Yang, Qian Xuesen, and others are largely not about morality, but about conscience. Both morality and conscience are fundamental to human society and individual spiritual life, but they have significant differences. The distinction is that morality is associated with specific environments, while conscience is universal. Is that hard to understand? Let me give an example: chastity, for instance, was a moral standard highly valued in the pre-industrial era. In that moral system, if an unmarried woman had sexual relations, it was called 'loss of chastity,' which could be life-threatening, right? But today, is that still an issue? That's why we have the concept of 'old morality,' which shows that morality is easily changeable and can be shaped by education. Conscience, however, is different; it originates from deep within. For example, the act of not raping someone holds true in any era. Even if you've never been educated, you know it's wrong because it violates the other person's free will. Morality and conscience are sometimes consistent, but sometimes they are not so consistent, or even diametrically opposed. For example, according to the Party's unique moral standards, Party spirit is above human nature, organizational discipline is above free will, and collectivism is above individual interests. According to this set of moral standards, if you are a soldier and the Party orders you to shoot students and fellow villagers, you must shoot. This is considered moral and for the greater good; you must suppress your conscience.</p>

### 工具理性与价值理性：科学中立的迷思

讨论完两者的区别，再来谈谈所谓的“科学中立”。**马克思·韦伯**（Max Weber: 德国著名社会学家、经济学家）就是那个写出了**《新教伦理与资本主义精神》**（The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism: 马克斯·韦伯的社会学著作）的大神。在他的著作**《经济与社会》**（Economy and Society: 马克斯·韦伯的社会学巨著）的第一章，就石破天惊地提出了一对概念，叫**工具理性**（Instrumental Rationality: 关注“如何做”以达成目标）和**价值理性**（Value Rationality: 关注“为何做”以及行动本身是否符合内在价值）。咱们通俗解释一下：所谓工具理性就是“how”，怎么做；而价值理性是“why”，为什么做，这么做是对的吗？前者就像是一台高效而冷酷的机器，它关注的是为了达到一个既定的目标，我们应该采取什么手段，怎么样才能用最少成本、最快的速度、最高效的方式完成。它不关心目标本身是不是好的，只关心能不能行和划不划算。而价值理性呢，它关注的是行动本身是否符合某种内在价值。举个最简单的例子，如果你是纳粹时期的德国军官，上头给你的命令是把犹太人（Jews）都屠戮了，工具理性的人会立马开始计算该怎么屠戮效率最高、处理起来成本最低，是用子弹、炸药还是毒气。而价值理性的人会感到煎熬，甚至拒绝执行这样的命令，因为它违反了你的良知。如果一个科学家在非常清楚自己所作所为会带来什么影响的前提下，还参与并且高效完成了毒气的研究，事后解释说“科学是中立的，我只关心毒气扩散的速度和对人体的影响，不要对我道德绑架”，这个解释你能接受吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alright, having discussed the differences between the two, let's talk about so-called 'scientific neutrality.' Max Weber, the great figure who wrote 'The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,' in the first chapter of his work 'Economy and Society,' brilliantly proposed a pair of concepts: instrumental rationality and value rationality. To explain it simply, instrumental rationality is 'how'—how to do it, while value rationality is 'why'—why do it, is doing it right? The former is like an efficient and cold machine; it focuses on what means should be adopted to achieve a given goal, how to complete it with the least cost, fastest speed, and most efficient method. It doesn't care whether the goal itself is good, only whether it's feasible and cost-effective. Value rationality, on the other hand, focuses on whether the action itself conforms to a certain intrinsic value. To give the simplest example, if you were a German officer during the Nazi era and your superiors ordered you to eliminate all Jews, a person with instrumental rationality would immediately start calculating how to do it most efficiently, with the lowest cost—using bullets, explosives, or poison gas. But a person with value rationality would feel tormented, or even refuse to execute such an order because it violates their conscience. If a scientist, fully aware of the potential impact of their actions, still participates in and efficiently completes research on poison gas, and afterwards explains that 'science is neutral, I only care about the speed of gas diffusion and its effect on the human body, don't morally blackmail me,' would you accept this explanation?</p>
</details>

### 平庸之恶与“螺丝钉精神”

我之前曾多次提到过**汉娜·阿伦特**（Hannah Arendt: 德裔美籍政治理论家）的**平庸之恶**（Banality of Evil: 指在极权体制下，个体无思想、无判断地执行命令所造成的罪恶）的概念。所有极权主义的国家机器，都有大批这种信奉技术中立、工具理性，从而放弃了良知的执行者。这也是为什么党，无论是纳粹党还是共产党，都会不遗余力地宣传“螺丝钉精神”的原因，因为螺丝钉是不需要大脑的，只要准时完成任务就可以了。至于这个任务是不是邪恶、是不是犯罪，和你无关。同时，因为螺丝钉太多，大家都一样，这极大地消解和稀释了每个螺丝钉的罪恶感，因为你会觉得“我只是在完成分内工作，有什么错呢？”这也是为什么中国参与过计划生育的妇产科医生们，申请美签和移民时基本上百分之百会被拒的原因。而且这些人往往还都挺委屈，觉得“我只是奉命行事，这能怪我吗？”但在签证官看来，你就是大屠杀的帮凶，因为你放弃了良知。了解了以上的逻辑，我们再来看看杨振宁是否符合上面的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have repeatedly mentioned Hannah Arendt's concept of the 'banality of evil.' All totalitarian state apparatuses have a large number of such executors who believe in technological neutrality and instrumental rationality, thereby abandoning their conscience. This is why the Party, whether the Nazi Party or the Communist Party, spares no effort to promote the 'screw spirit,' because a screw doesn't need a brain; it just needs to complete tasks on time. As for whether the task is evil or criminal, it's irrelevant to you. At the same time, because there are so many screws and everyone is the same, this greatly dissolves and dilutes the guilt of each screw, because you feel, 'I'm just doing my job, what's wrong with that?' This is also why obstetricians and gynecologists in China who participated in the one-child policy are almost 100% rejected when applying for US visas and immigration. And these people often feel quite wronged, thinking, 'I was just following orders, how can you blame me?' But in the eyes of the visa officer, you are an accomplice to genocide because you abandoned your conscience. Having understood the above logic, let's see if Chen-Ning Yang fits the definition.</p>
</details>

### 评价人物：人品与成就应分而论

这里多插一句，简中网络有个很不好的习惯，就是评价一个人的时候，喜欢把人品和能力成就混为一谈，只接受单一的评价。比如在评价**杨振宁**的时候，我听到最多反驳的声音就是“杨老的成就如何如何伟大，是载入历史史册的人物，你还没资格评价他”。这就属于典型的逻辑谬误啊！他学术上有多少成就和人品如何有关系吗？举个例子，假设一个名厨做饭很好吃，同时又强奸了幼女，你能不能因为他做菜做得好，就来一句“他可是拿过国际大奖的国宝级厨师，批评他你还不够格”吗？显然不行。反过来一样，你不能因为他人品卑劣，就连带着不承认他在专业领域的才能。对一个人的评价，从来就应该是分成多个层次，一码归一码的。这也是我一直以来的态度。你看我之前做节目评价**王菊**（Wang Ju: 媒体人）也不会因为她有过家暴就影响对她业务能力的判断，我说她不是个好记者纯粹就是因为她业务能力真的拉胯。说回杨振宁，接下来咱就详细说说他到底是个怎样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here, I'll interject that there's a very bad habit on the simplified Chinese internet: when evaluating a person, they like to conflate character with ability and achievement, only accepting a single evaluation. For example, when evaluating Chen-Ning Yang, the most common rebuttal I hear is, 'Elder Yang's achievements are so great, he's a figure recorded in history; you're not qualified to evaluate him.' This is a typical logical fallacy. What do his academic achievements have to do with his character? For example, suppose a famous chef cooks delicious food but also rapes a young girl. Can you say, 'He's a national treasure chef who has won international awards; you're not qualified to criticize him,' just because he cooks well? Obviously not. Conversely, you cannot deny his professional talent just because his character is despicable. The evaluation of a person should always be multi-layered, separating one thing from another. This has always been my attitude. For example, when I previously made a program evaluating Wang Ju, I wouldn't let her history of domestic violence affect my judgment of her professional ability. I said she wasn't a good journalist purely because her professional ability was truly subpar. Back to Chen-Ning Yang, next, let's talk in detail about what kind of person he really was.</p>
</details>

### 杨武之的价值观：功利、民族与宏大叙事

1922年，**杨振宁**出生在安徽合肥一个书香世家。他的父亲**杨武之**（Yang Wuzhi: 数学家，杨振宁的父亲）早年曾公费留学**斯坦福大学**（Stanford University: 美国著名私立研究型大学）和**芝加哥大学**（University of Chicago: 美国著名私立研究型大学），是中国首个因研究数论而获得博士学位的数学家，也是**陈省身**（Shiing-Shen Chern: 著名数学家）和**华罗庚**（Hua Luogeng: 著名数学家）的老师。之所以特别提到杨武之，是因为杨振宁本人的价值观很大程度上受到他父亲的影响。了解了他的父亲，你大概就能看清楚他本人的底色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1922, Chen-Ning Yang was born into a scholarly family in Hefei, Anhui. His father, Yang Wuzhi, studied abroad at Stanford and the University of Chicago on a government scholarship in his early years. He was China's first mathematician to receive a doctorate for research in number theory, and also a teacher to Shiing-Shen Chern and Hua Luogeng. The reason I specifically mention Yang Wuzhi is that Chen-Ning Yang's values were largely influenced by his father. Understanding his father will give you a clear picture of Chen-Ning Yang's fundamental character.</p>
</details>

那么杨武之是个什么样的人呢？这里可以说几件事：
第一，杨武之自幼父母双亡，是跟着叔叔长大的，他甚至连自己母亲的名字都不知道。回忆起母亲时，只有一件事令他印象深刻，就是母亲经常搂着他们兄弟俩说：“你们俩一定要好好读书，将来去做官，才不会被人瞧不起，才不会受人欺负。”后来他也经常给杨振宁和其他的孩子们讲述这段经历，用来激励鞭策他们好好读书。
第二，杨武之出国留学前，曾在安徽省立安庆中学担任老师兼舍监。因过于严厉而和学生们发生了冲突，愤而辞职，随后出国留学。出国前，他留下了一张和刚一岁儿子的合影，合影里，他依旧穿着旧式的长袍马褂，而不是当时流行的西装或者中式服装。
第三，根据杨振宁回忆，家里有很多英文和德文书，但父亲并不鼓励他看，反而是请人到家里来教他《孟子》和一些国学方面的书。父亲私下也会教杨振宁唱歌，全都是民国初年的一些爱国歌曲，像是**石庚**（Shi Geng: 词作家）的**《中国男儿》**（Chinese Men: 民国初年爱国歌曲）和**李叔同**（Li Shutong: 著名音乐家、教育家）的**《祖国歌》**（Song of the Motherland: 民国初年爱国歌曲）。多提一句，杨振宁的发小兼邻居**邓稼先**也差不多，他爸从小教他的是四书五经、忠孝节义。
第四，杨振宁从小就很有数学天赋，多次向父亲请教解析几何和微积分方面的问题，但父亲不但不教，还反对他学数学专业，理由是数学不实用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what kind of person was Yang Wuzhi? Here are a few things I can say. First, Yang Wuzhi's parents both died when he was young, and he was raised by his uncle. He didn't even know his mother's name. When recalling his mother, only one thing left a deep impression on him: his mother often hugged him and his brother, saying, 'You two must study hard so that you can become officials in the future, then you won't be looked down upon or bullied.' He later often recounted this experience to Chen-Ning Yang and his other children to inspire and urge them to study hard. Second, before studying abroad, Yang Wuzhi worked as a teacher and dormitory supervisor at Anhui Provincial Liya Middle School. Due to his overly strict nature, he clashed with students and resigned in anger, then went abroad to study. Before leaving, he left a photo with his one-year-old son. In the photo, he was still wearing a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket, rather than the popular Western suits or Zhongshan suits of the time. Third, according to Chen-Ning Yang's recollections, there were many English and German books at home, but his father did not encourage him to read them. Instead, he hired someone to teach him Mencius and other traditional Chinese studies. His father would also privately teach Chen-Ning Yang to sing, all patriotic songs from the early Republic of China, such as Shi Geng's 'Chinese Men' and Li Shutong's 'Song of the Motherland.' On a side note, Chen-Ning Yang's childhood friend and neighbor, Deng Jiaxian, was similar; his father taught him the Four Books and Five Classics, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness from a young age. Fourth, Chen-Ning Yang showed great mathematical talent from a young age and repeatedly asked his father for help with analytical geometry and calculus. But his father not only refused to teach him but also opposed him studying mathematics as a major, reasoning that mathematics was impractical.</p>
</details>

听完这件事，你对**杨振宁**的这位教授父亲是个什么样的人，应该已经有初步了解了。我们可以用以下几个词来描述他的底层价值观：世故达变、功利主义、民族主义，满脑子宏大叙事。可以这么说，尽管他去美国留过学，但或许是因为学的是数学而不是人文社科专业的原因，他骨子里依然是一个典型的那个年代的中式小知识分子，和**毛泽东**（Mao Zedong: 中共前领导人）这类人差不多。关于这一点，在他后来三次劝说儿子杨振宁回大陆报效祖国时，则表现得更为明显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After hearing this, you should have a preliminary understanding of what kind of person Chen-Ning Yang's professor father was. We can describe his underlying values with the following terms: worldly success, utilitarianism, nationalism, and a mind full of grand narratives. It can be said that although he studied abroad in the United States, perhaps because he studied mathematics rather than humanities and social sciences, he was still fundamentally a typical Chinese intellectual of that era, similar to figures like Mao Zedong. This point became even more evident when he later persuaded his son, Chen-Ning Yang, three times to return to mainland China to serve the motherland.</p>
</details>

### 杨武之的三次“统战”：父子间的政治拉锯

说起这段经历，还颇有点戏剧性。1957年，**杨振宁**和**李政道**（Tsung-Dao Lee: 著名物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖获得者）一起获得诺贝尔奖。**中共**和台湾方面都派人接洽游说。**杨武之**主动提出要去游说杨振宁回国，并得到了**周恩来**（Zhou Enlai: 中共前总理）和**统战部**（United Front Work Department: 中共负责统战工作的部门）的批准。杨武之的游说一共进行了三次，分别是1957年、1960年和1962年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This experience was quite dramatic. In 1957, Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee jointly won the Nobel Prize. Both the CCP and Taiwan sent people to lobby them. Yang Wuzhi actively offered to persuade Chen-Ning Yang to return to China and received approval from Zhou Enlai and the United Front Work Department. Yang Wuzhi's lobbying efforts took place three times: in 1957, 1960, and 1962.</p>
</details>

第一次，杨武之对儿子是这么说的：“即便你因为某些原因暂时不能回国，那也绝对不要去台湾。眼下的形势是大陆会一天天强盛起来，而台湾会慢慢萎缩下去，这就是未来的大趋势。”是不是听着有点耳熟？当然，这话除了有明显的功利意味外，还多少带着点胁迫，意思是“如果你去了台湾，我们一家老小可就你掂量着办吧”。这次的游说没能成功，一个最直接的原因是当时席卷中国的**反右运动**（Anti-Rightist Movement: 中共在1957年发起的政治运动）。另一位受周恩来指派前去“挖人”的物理学家**张文裕**（Zhang Wenyu: 著名物理学家）也感受到了这一点。据他回忆，他第一次去诺奖颁奖现场和杨、李二人会面时，两人还比较热情，说了些“感谢祖国的关心，我们现在还年轻，争取工作一段时间之后再回国”的话。等到了1958年，再赴日内瓦给他俩做工作时，杨、李二人就明显没那么热情了，显然，他俩都知道国内发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first time, Yang Wuzhi told his son, 'Even if you temporarily cannot return to the mainland for some reason, you absolutely must not go to Taiwan. The current situation is that the mainland will grow stronger day by day, while Taiwan will gradually shrink. This is the future trend.' Does that sound a bit familiar? Of course, besides its obvious utilitarian implications, these words also carried a hint of coercion, meaning, 'If you go to Taiwan, our whole family here will be in trouble, so you should think carefully.' This lobbying attempt was unsuccessful, one direct reason being the Anti-Rightist Movement sweeping across China at the time. Another physicist, Zhang Wenyu, who was dispatched by Zhou Enlai to recruit them, also felt this. According to his recollection, when he first met Yang and Lee at the Nobel Prize ceremony, both were relatively enthusiastic, expressing gratitude for the motherland's concern and saying they were still young and would strive to work for a period before returning to China. However, by 1958, when he went to Geneva again to work on them, Yang and Lee were noticeably less enthusiastic. Clearly, both knew what was happening domestically.</p>
</details>

杨武之的第二、第三次游说就更加没底气了。这两次游说都处于**三年大饥荒**（Three Years of Great Famine: 中国1959-1961年间的大规模饥荒）时期。杨武之虽然极力粉饰，但终究是纸包不住火。这里还有个小插曲：“有一天晚上，我父亲就跟我介绍中国怎么样，他说中国现在怎么好怎么好，他说从前中国一根针都不会做。他说现在不但是针能够，现在可以坐桥，可以坐飞机，然后这样好那样好。我母亲在旁边就插过来说：‘你不要误导儿子，我现在我要前几天出去要买几块豆腐，占了四个钟头的牌，还只买了几块别墅的豆腐，这有什么好？’这个讲了以后，我父亲非常生气，我父亲说：‘你竟给振宁错误的消息！’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yang Wuzhi's second and third lobbying attempts were even less confident. Both of these lobbying efforts took place during the Three Years of Great Famine. Although Yang Wuzhi tried his best to gloss over the situation, the truth could not be concealed. Here's a small anecdote: 'One evening, my father was telling me about China, how good China was now. He said that China couldn't even make a needle before, but now it can not only make needles but also build bridges and airplanes, and everything is so good. My mother interjected from the side, saying, "Don't mislead our son. Just a few days ago, I had to queue for four hours to buy a few pieces of tofu, and I only managed to buy a few pieces of inferior tofu. What's so good about that?" After she said this, my father became very angry. My father said, "You are giving Zhenning wrong information!"'</p>
</details>

有人可能会以为杨武之会这么睁眼说瞎话，可能是因为他住在象牙塔里，不知道农村饿死了几千万人。但实际情况是，对于中国的现状他非常清楚。据杨振宁的弟弟**杨振翰**（Yang Zhenhan: 杨振宁的弟弟）回忆，杨武之第二次游说失败回国后曾对他表示：“你母亲给你大哥讲了上海生活的真实情况，我非常矛盾。虽然她讲的都是实情，但你母亲没有大局观，不能长远地看问题，导致我没机会把我对中国未来的完整预测讲给你大哥，听说服他回国。”如果说第二次统战杨武之还抱有些困难只是暂时的侥幸心理的话，第三次劝说时他就已经完全是在说伪心话诓骗儿子了。因为就在他劝说失败对杨母大发脾气之后，他对子女们又说出了心里话：“我现在很矛盾，国内现在各方面都有些失序，我该怎么开口劝说振宁回来呢？你母亲说他回来不仅没法做研究，得不到诺贝尔奖，还会受到冲击。你母亲说的是对的，但他老留在美国，美国政府又老是与中国为敌，我们都住在国内，长此以往如何是好？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might think that Yang Wuzhi might have been so disingenuous because he lived in an ivory tower and didn't know that tens of millions of people had starved to death in the countryside. But the reality was that he was very clear about China's situation. According to Chen-Ning Yang's younger brother, Yang Zhenhan, Yang Wuzhi expressed to him after his second failed lobbying attempt to return to China: 'Your mother told your elder brother the true situation of life in Shanghai. I am very conflicted. Although what she said was true, your mother lacks a broader perspective and cannot look at problems from a long-term view, which prevented me from having the opportunity to present my complete prediction for China's future to your elder brother and persuade him to return.' If Yang Wuzhi's second united front attempt still held some temporary, hopeful illusions, by the third persuasion, he was completely speaking against his conscience and deceiving his son. Because right after his failed persuasion and his outburst of anger at Yang's mother, he confided in his children, saying, 'I am very conflicted now. Things are somewhat out of order in all aspects domestically. How can I possibly persuade Zhenning to come back? Your mother says that if he comes back, he won't be able to do research, won't get a Nobel Prize, and will be subjected to criticism. Your mother is right, but if he stays in the United States, the American government is always hostile to China. We all live in China; how can this continue in the long run?'</p>
</details>

这里多说一句，就在那几年，杨武之在**芝加哥大学**的校友、另一位诺贝尔物理学奖获得者**崔奇**（Daniel Chee Tsui: 著名物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖获得者）的父亲在河南平顶山农村被活活饿死。数年后的**文革**（Cultural Revolution: 中国1966-1976年间的政治运动），母亲又因为儿子在美国被控“里通外国”迫害致死。而**李政道**的铁哥们、同样毕业于**芝加哥大学**的**乌宁昆**（Wu Ningkun: 著名翻译家、学者）博士，自从归国以后被划成极右分子，进了劳改营，此时正在清河农场三分厂负责清理因为大饥荒饿死的人的尸体。在这种情况下，一个父亲居然还能舔着脸把亲生儿子往火坑里推，同样身为人父的我，只能用一句话来形容他：党性盖过人性。纵观杨武之的言行，你会发现个很有意思的现象，那就是尽管他身为数学家，数理逻辑能力应该是很强的，但看待现实问题时逻辑几乎是零分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another point: in those very years, Yang Wuzhi's alumnus from the University of Chicago, another Nobel laureate in physics, Daniel Chee Tsui, had his father starved to death in a village in Pinglishan, Henan. Years later, during the Cultural Revolution, his mother was persecuted to death for being accused of colluding with foreign countries because her son was in the United States. And Tsung-Dao Lee's close friend, Dr. Wu Ningkun, also a graduate of the University of Chicago, was labeled an ultra-rightist after returning to China and was sent to a labor camp. At that time, he was responsible for clearing the bodies of those who had starved to death in the Qinghe Farm Third Branch Factory due to the Great Famine. Under such circumstances, a father could still shamelessly push his biological son into a fiery pit. As a father myself, I can only describe him with one phrase: Party spirit overshadowed human nature. Looking at Yang Wuzhi's words and deeds, you'll find a very interesting phenomenon: despite being a mathematician with strong logical and mathematical reasoning abilities, his logic was almost zero when viewing real-world problems.</p>
</details>

比如他在首次劝说儿子回国失败后，给儿子儿媳留下这么一幅字：“美范勿忘亲爱勇有声音感国恩红光”。这两句“屁话”简直是280个大耳刮子。前一句是典型的道德绑架加情感勒索，“美范勿忘”是时时刻刻暗示儿子忘恩负义，将亲情转化成债务，让他生活在愧疚之中，压抑他的独立人格发展。而后半句则是逻辑混乱的家国同构，将家庭内部的孝道和报恩伦理平移到政权，要求对方无条件服从。用今天的话说就是“勿忘咱妈，感谢国家”。但杨武之的言行比上文这句还要恶劣，因为即便你真的要感谢国家，杨家父子要感恩的也应该是**中华民国**（Republic of China: 中国1912-1949年的政权），因为你俩都是国民政府的公派留学生，出国前白纸黑字签了契约，就算要报效祖国也应该去台湾。如果按照旧道德的标准，杨武之的这个行为大概就相当于明末施琅、黄梁的士大夫，清军一入关就主动投诚，不仅自己投敌，还转头告诫儿子要效忠大清，对顺治皇帝感恩戴德。这背后的逻辑一言以蔽之：谁赢了谁就是我主子。之所以花这么多笔墨来谈杨武之，是因为纵观**杨振宁**一生的所作所为，几乎全盘继承了他父亲的价值观。

<p class="english-text">For example, after his first failed attempt to persuade his son to return to China, he left his son and daughter-in-law with a couplet: 'Do not forget filial piety, be grateful for national grace, and shine with red light.' These two sentences are utter nonsense. The first sentence is typical moral blackmail and emotional extortion: 'Do not forget filial piety' constantly implies that his son is ungrateful, transforming family affection into a debt, making him live in guilt and suppressing his independent personality development. The second half is a logically confused conflation of family and state, transferring the internal ethics of filial piety and gratitude to the political regime, demanding unconditional obedience. In today's terms, it's 'Don't forget Mom, thank the country.' But Yang Wuzhi's words and deeds were even worse than this, because even if you truly wanted to thank the country, the Yang father and son should have been grateful to the Republic of China, because both of them were government-sponsored students of the Nationalist government, having signed contracts in black and white before going abroad. Even if they were to serve the motherland, they should have gone to Taiwan. If judged by old moral standards, Yang Wuzhi's behavior would be akin to a literati official at the end of the Ming Dynasty who, upon the Qing army's entry, actively surrendered and then turned around to admonish his son to pledge allegiance to the Qing Dynasty and be grateful to Emperor Shunzhi. The logic behind this, in a nutshell, is: whoever wins is my master. The reason I spent so much ink discussing Yang Wuzhi is that, looking at Chen-Ning Yang's actions throughout his life, he almost entirely inherited his father's values.</p>

### 杨振宁与李政道恩怨：学术荣誉与个人品格

**杨振宁**做的第一件有争议的事，是和**李政道**之间的恩怨。1972年，李政道回国，当时**杨武之**正在**华东医院**（Huadong Hospital: 上海一家著名医院）住院。听说李政道也在上海，他特意请李政道到医院见面。见面以后，他握住李政道的手说：“很清楚振宁和你62年决裂的经过，是振宁对不起你。你们都是天下的奇才，但为了中国下一代的学子，还请你原谅他。”你看，都到这会儿了，还是个老糊涂，逻辑混乱。杨振宁对不起你李政道，跟中国下一代的学子有什么关系呢？八竿子打不着啊！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first controversial thing Chen-Ning Yang did was his feud with Tsung-Dao Lee. In 1972, Tsung-Dao Lee returned to China. At that time, Yang Wuzhi was hospitalized in Huadong Hospital. Hearing that Lee was also in Shanghai, he specifically invited him to meet at the hospital. After meeting, he held Tsung-Dao Lee's hand and said, 'I clearly understand the process of your breakup with Zhenning in '62. Zhenning was in the wrong. You are both extraordinary talents, but for the sake of China's next generation of students, please forgive him.' You see, even at this point, he was still muddled and illogical. What does Chen-Ning Yang being in the wrong with Tsung-Dao Lee have to do with China's next generation of students? It's completely unrelated!</p>
</details>

那么杨振宁到底做了什么对不起李政道的事呢？以下咱们详细解说。
先说**李政道**，这哥们是真正的物理天才，26岁就成了**哥伦比亚大学**（Columbia University: 美国著名私立研究型大学）的助理教授，29岁就成了哥大200年历史上最年轻的终身教授。赴美留学以后，因为杨振宁既是他西南联大时期的师兄又是同行，两人很快就熟络起来。1956年，李政道在研究当时物理学公认的西塔-陶疑点时，产生了一个大胆的猜想：若相互作用下**宇称守恒定律**（Parity Conservation Law: 物理学基本定律之一）可能不成立，也就是后来获得诺奖的**宇称不守恒**（Parity Non-conservation: 指在弱相互作用中，宇称不再守恒的物理现象）的核心观点。因为他之前跟杨振宁合作过几次，这次就又拉上他来聊。杨振宁一开始表示反对，但聊了一阵以后很快就被李政道说服了。随后，李政道又找到了有“中国居里夫人”之称的另一位实验物理学家**吴健雄**（Chien-Shiung Wu: 著名实验物理学家）合作，帮忙实验论证。最终，李、杨二人共同凭这一成果获得诺贝尔奖。需要说明的是，这个奖吴健雄女士也完全是有资格拿的，没给她颁奖也是诺奖历史上极有争议的一次事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what exactly did Chen-Ning Yang do to wrong Tsung-Dao Lee? Let's explain in detail below. First, Tsung-Dao Lee was a true physics genius. At 26, he became an assistant professor at Columbia University, and at 29, he became the youngest full professor in Columbia's 200-year history. After studying in the US, since Yang was both his senior from Southwest Associated University and a colleague, the two quickly became close. In 1956, while researching the universally recognized theta-tau puzzle in physics, Tsung-Dao Lee had a bold conjecture: that the parity conservation law might not hold true under weak interactions—this was the core idea of the parity non-conservation that later won the Nobel Prize. Since he had collaborated with Chen-Ning Yang several times before, he brought him in to discuss it again. Yang initially expressed opposition but was quickly convinced by Tsung-Dao Lee after some discussion. Subsequently, Tsung-Dao Lee sought collaboration with another experimental physicist, Chien-Shiung Wu, known as China's Madame Curie, to help experimentally verify the conjecture. Ultimately, Lee and Yang jointly won the Nobel Prize for this achievement. It should be noted that Ms. Chien-Shiung Wu was fully qualified to receive this award, and not awarding it to her was a highly controversial incident in Nobel Prize history.</p>
</details>

但就在获奖前夕，**杨振宁**突然提出了文章署名顺序的问题，说希望把自己的名字排在前面。这个说法让**李政道**很吃惊，因为按照国际惯例，论文署名通常遵循两个原则：首先是贡献原则，贡献大的排前面；如果贡献难以比较，就按照姓氏首字母原则。两人前后合作了十多篇论文，除了1952年的首次合作外，一直都是李在前。而这次的成果核心创意和观点是李政道提出来的，找**吴健雄**合作论证猜想也是李政道提出来的，李政道担任的是项目经理的角色，无论按哪个标准都应该是李在前、杨在后。但杨振宁有自己的一套歪理，说自己比李政道大，按中国人的规矩应该自己在前。明眼人都能看出来这是个托词，你又不是今天才突然大了四岁，之前之后你怎么不提呢？杨振宁此时真实的心理很可能是因为当时的他并没有什么重大的学术成就，他的**杨-米尔斯规范场理论**（Yang-Mills Gauge Theory: 物理学中的一个重要理论）还没有被发掘出来，拿诺奖当然就是最重大的荣誉了，所以哪怕厚着脸皮也得争一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, just before the award, Chen-Ning Yang suddenly raised the issue of the order of names in the article, saying he hoped his name would be listed first. This statement surprised Tsung-Dao Lee, because according to international practice, the order of authors in a paper usually follows two principles. First is the contribution principle, where the person with the greater contribution is listed first. If contributions are difficult to compare, then the alphabetical order of surnames is followed. The two had collaborated on more than ten papers, and except for their first collaboration in 1952, Lee had always been listed first. And the core idea and viewpoint of this achievement were proposed by Tsung-Dao Lee; finding Chien-Shiung Wu for experimental verification was also proposed by Lee. Lee played the role of project manager. By any standard, Lee should have been listed first and Yang second. But Chen-Ning Yang had his own twisted logic, saying that he was older than Tsung-Dao Lee, and according to Chinese custom, his name should come first. Anyone with a clear mind can see this was an excuse. You weren't suddenly four years older today; why didn't you bring it up before or after? Yang's true psychology at the time was likely that he had no major academic achievements then; his Yang-Mills gauge theory had not yet been discovered. Winning the Nobel Prize was, of course, the greatest honor, so he had to contend for it, even shamelessly.</p>
</details>

多说一句，杨振宁最引以为傲的**杨-米尔斯规范场论**，他和**米尔斯**（Robert Mills: 物理学家，杨-米尔斯规范场理论的合作者）的关系，就和**宇称不守恒**里他和**李政道**的关系一样，只是反过来了：他提出核心创意和观点，米尔斯作为合作方。今天墙内一提到杨-米尔斯，都说米尔斯只是杨的助手，按这个标准的话，拿诺奖的宇称不守恒，杨振宁也算是李政道的助手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On a side note, Yang's most proud achievement, the Yang-Mills gauge theory, his relationship with Mills was the same as his relationship with Tsung-Dao Lee in parity non-conservation, just reversed. He proposed the core idea and viewpoint, and Mills was the collaborator. Today, whenever Yang-Mills is mentioned within China, they say Mills was just Yang's assistant. By this standard, in the Nobel-winning parity non-conservation, Yang could also be considered Lee's assistant.</p>
</details>

这次的署名要求**李政道**并未同意，所以我们今天看到的论文依然是李前杨后。但到了诺奖颁奖现场，**杨振宁**再次要求在李政道之前领奖。因为拿奖是个高兴的事，李政道也不好当场撕破脸皮，就只好同意了。于是就出现了我们现在看到的杨振宁先出场领奖、先发言的情况，这也是为什么中国大陆一提到这次诺奖总是说“杨振宁、李政道”的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lee did not agree to this request for authorship order, so the paper we see today still lists Lee first, then Yang. But at the Nobel Prize ceremony, Yang again requested to receive the award before Lee. Since winning an award is a happy occasion, Lee didn't want to cause a scene and reluctantly agreed. Thus, we see the situation where Yang appeared first to receive the award and speak first. This is also why mainland China always mentions 'Chen-Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee' when referring to this Nobel Prize.</p>
</details>

但直到此时，两人还没真正决裂。决裂的导火索发生在五年以后。一名记者写了一篇文章，介绍杨、李二人解决**宇称不守恒**问题的过程。送给两人审稿的时候，李政道没有提出异议，但杨振宁则提出文章中有些“令人痛苦的地方”，要求文中提到诺贝尔奖及其他有两人署名的地方，应该将自己的名字放在前面；如果不得已要把李政道放在前面，一定要标注是出于字母顺序习惯。李政道知道这件事以后非常失望，主动找到杨振宁说以后不再合作了。杨振宁也情绪激动，大哭起来，说很希望以后继续合作，但李政道还是拒绝了。随后，李政道向两人所在的**普林斯顿高等研究院**（Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton: 著名学术研究机构）提出了辞呈。得知此事的**奥本海默**（J. Robert Oppenheimer: 著名物理学家，原子弹之父）说出了那句著名的：“李政道应该不要再做高能物理了，而杨振宁应该去看精神科医生。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But even at this point, the two had not truly broken up. The fuse for their breakup occurred five years later. A journalist wrote an article introducing how Yang and Lee solved the parity non-conservation problem. When it was sent to both for review, Lee raised no objections. But Chen-Ning Yang stated that there were some 'painful parts' in the article and demanded that wherever the Nobel Prize and other places where both their names were mentioned, his name should be placed first. If Lee's name had to be placed first, it must be explicitly noted that it was due to alphabetical order convention. Tsung-Dao Lee was very disappointed after learning about this and proactively told Chen-Ning Yang that he would no longer collaborate. Yang also became emotional and cried, saying he very much hoped to continue collaborating, but Lee still refused. Subsequently, Tsung-Dao Lee submitted his resignation to the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, where they both worked. Upon hearing this, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb,' famously said, 'Tsung-Dao Lee should no longer do high-energy physics, and Chen-Ning Yang should see a psychiatrist.'</p>

### 杨振宁为中共站台：从文革到计划生育

如果说以上这件事体现了**杨振宁**和他父亲一样的功利主义价值观的话，那以下这件事则可以用“一言难尽”来形容了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the above incident reflects Chen-Ning Yang's utilitarian values, similar to his father's, then the following incident can only be described as beyond words.</p>
</details>

首先是1971年，**尼克松**（Richard Nixon: 美国前总统）访华前夕，杨振宁结束了赴华访问，回到美国时在**纽约大学**（New York University: 美国著名私立研究型大学）实习分校进行了多场题为《我对中华人民共和国的印象》的演讲，分享了他的见闻。开篇的部分，他满怀深情地说：“我发觉今天的中国是完全的改变了，和26年前我认识的中国已完全不同。最重要的一点，也是最值得中国人自豪的一点，就是精神。”接下来，他先是对正在进行的**文革**表达了高度正面的评价，称赞中国教育体系在文革期间的伟大成就，比如“教育和劳动生产相结合”的原则（这指的应该是**上山下乡运动**：中国在文革期间将城市知识青年送到农村的运动），强调教育要为人民服务，要理论联系实际，还建议美国也应该学习中国的教育和招生制度。其次，他认为文革推动了对官僚主义和旧的行政体系的冲击，有助于社会精神的复兴和群众的参与，是值得肯定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, in 1971, on the eve of Nixon's visit to China, Chen-Ning Yang concluded his visit to China and, upon returning to the United States, gave several lectures at the New York University School of Continuing Education titled 'My Impressions of the People's Republic of China,' sharing his observations. In the opening part, he said with deep emotion, 'I found that today's China has completely changed and is entirely different from the China I knew 26 years ago. The most important point, and the most pride-worthy for Chinese people, is their spirit.' Next, he first expressed highly positive evaluations of the ongoing Cultural Revolution, praising the great achievements of China's education system during the Cultural Revolution, such as the principle of combining education with productive labor (this should refer to the 'Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside' movement), emphasizing that education should serve the people's lives and connect theory with practice. He even suggested that the United States should also learn from China's education and enrollment systems. Secondly, he believed that the Cultural Revolution promoted an attack on bureaucracy and the old administrative system, which contributed to the revival of social spirit and mass participation, and was worthy of affirmation.</p>
</details>

最离谱的是，他还公然为**中共**最为人诟病的几大恶政站台和背书，包括哪些呢？
一个是曾经大规模推广的臭名昭著的**针灸麻醉**（Acupuncture Anesthesia: 一种通过针灸刺激达到麻醉效果的方法）。关于这一点，著名作家、“童话大王”的作者**郑渊洁**（Zheng Yuanjie: 中国著名童话作家）曾有幸体验并且记录了下来，有兴趣的朋友可以看看他的感受。而杨振宁的说法是，他亲眼见到一个针灸麻醉的女病人在剖开她肚皮的时候，神志清醒并且感觉不到任何疼痛，还表示针刺麻醉的理论研究可能是个重大的课题。
其次是他盛赞中共开始实行的**计划生育**（One-Child Policy: 中国曾推行的强制性人口控制政策），就是强制引产政策。他表示女护士们告诉他，他们可以给超过六个月的孕妇实施堕胎手术，安全率百分之百。杨振宁对这种所谓高效的堕胎技术感到惊讶，说在医学的某些领域上，今天的中国明显的是比其他的国家更进步的，其中之一便是堕胎的方法。
第三是他极力称赞中共当时宣传、后来被证明是造假的**农业学大寨**（Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture: 中国在文革期间推广的农业运动），称大寨的农作物产量远高于其他地区，这使中国彻底实现了粮食上的自给自足，并已经开始对外出口粮食。无论是在农村还是城市，都不缺少米和面粉，蔬菜和水果又多又便宜，上海工人的伙食比我们美国的学生食堂还要好一些，大家都说全靠**毛主席思想**（Mao Zedong Thought: 毛泽东的政治军事理论）的正确领导。这里稍微补充一点，杨振宁提到中国粮食自给自足还对外出口，其实是为了回应外界的质疑，也就是在**三年大饥荒**期间，中共一边从加拿大、美国进口粮食或者接受粮食援助，一边还在对阿尔巴尼亚等国家无偿赠送粮食。这在西方尤其是美国引发了很多批评声，而当时的中国是坚决否认发生饥荒的。杨振宁的表态相当于为中共宣传做了背书。
第四是他为毛泽东的个人崇拜和**《红宝书》**（Little Red Book: 《毛主席语录》的通俗称谓），包括残酷的集体主义迫害进行了辩护，称《红宝书》是中国民众自发的对于领袖的爱戴，而工人农民的牺牲则源于中国几千年来的文化传统。总之，民众都是自愿的、幸福的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most outrageously, he openly endorsed and vouched for several of the CCP's most criticized evil policies. What did these include? One was the infamous acupuncture anesthesia, which was widely promoted. On this point, the famous writer Zheng Yuanjie, author of 'The King of Fairy Tales,' once had the opportunity to experience and record it; interested friends can read about his feelings. Yang's statement was that he personally witnessed a female patient undergoing acupuncture anesthesia who was conscious and felt no pain during her laparotomy, and he also stated that theoretical research on acupuncture anesthesia might be a major topic. Secondly, he highly praised the family planning policy, which was essentially forced abortion, that the CCP had begun to implement. He stated that female nurses told him they could perform abortions on pregnant women over six months with a 100% safety rate. Yang expressed surprise at this so-called efficient abortion technique, saying that in some areas of medicine, today's China is clearly more advanced than other countries, and abortion methods are one of them. Thirdly, he vigorously praised the 'Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture' campaign, which the CCP promoted at the time and was later proven to be fraudulent. He claimed that Dazhai's crop yields were far higher than other regions, which enabled China to achieve complete self-sufficiency in grain and had already begun exporting grain. He said that neither in rural nor urban areas was there a shortage of rice and flour, and vegetables and fruits were abundant and cheap. The meals for Shanghai workers were even better than those in American student cafeterias, and everyone said it was all thanks to the correct leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, I'll add a bit: Yang's mention of China's grain self-sufficiency and exports was actually a response to external doubts, specifically that during the Three Years of Great Famine, the CCP was simultaneously importing grain from Canada and the United States or accepting food aid, while also gratuitously donating grain to countries like Albania. This sparked much criticism in the West, especially in the United States, and China at the time firmly denied that a famine was occurring. Yang's statement amounted to endorsing CCP propaganda. Fourth, he defended Mao Zedong's personality cult and the Little Red Book, including the cruel collectivist persecution, claiming that the Little Red Book was a spontaneous expression of the Chinese people's love for their leader, and the sacrifices of workers and peasants stemmed from China's millennia-old cultural tradition. In short, the people were all voluntary and happy.</p>

纵览整篇演讲稿，它几乎回避了所有中共各种政治运动带来的灾难和反人类暴行。如果你不知道演讲者的身份，还以为这是中共外交部的通稿呢？

<p class="english-text">Throughout the entire speech, he almost completely avoided all the disasters and anti-human atrocities brought about by the CCP's various political movements.

### 与毛泽东的会面：谄媚之态

第二件事，是1973年7月18日，**杨振宁**得到了**毛泽东**的接见，并和这位据说初中数学考过0分的中专生畅谈了对当代物理学的看法。**《人民日报》**（People's Daily: 中共中央机关报）刊登了全文。这场会见的对话内容，我这里稍微念几句：落座以后，毛泽东问杨振宁：“物质是无限可分的，如果物质分到一个阶段变成不可分了，那么一万年以后科学家干什么呢？”接着毛泽东从中国古典哲学里为自己的辩证思想寻找依据，说：“古书里说‘一日之棰，日取其半，万世不竭’，这就是物质可分的意思吗？”随后他又扯了些辩证法，公孙龙说过“白马非马”，马有白马、黑马、大马、小马，还有日本的高头大马、非洲的斑马，但是看不见那个“马”呀。又比如人有男人、女人，男人是人又不是人，或者女人是人也可以，可你是女人吗？所以又看不见人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second incident was on July 18, 1973, when Chen-Ning Yang was received by Mao Zedong and had a conversation with this vocational school graduate, who reportedly scored 0 in junior high math, discussing contemporary physics. The People's Daily published the full transcript. I'll read a few lines of the conversation from this meeting. After sitting down, Mao asked Yang, 'Matter is infinitely divisible. If matter is divided to a stage where it becomes indivisible, what will scientists do ten thousand years from now?' Then Mao sought philosophical basis for his dialectical thought from classical Chinese philosophy, saying, 'Ancient texts say, "If you take half of a foot-long stick every day, it will never be exhausted." Does this mean matter is divisible?' He then rambled about dialectics, saying, 'Gongsun Long said, "A white horse is not a horse." There are white horses, black horses, big horses, small horses, and tall Japanese horses, African zebras, but you can't see *that* horse. Or, for example, there are men and women. A man is a person, but also not a person, or a woman can be a person, but are you a woman? So you can't see *that* person.'</p>
</details>

面对这种中学生水平的“吹水”，**杨振宁**是什么态度呢？杨振宁以敬佩的口吻说道：“主席您看得很远，看到了社会的将来。您把科学实验与阶级斗争、生产斗争一起提，很重要。”过了一会儿，杨振宁又表示：“我很喜欢毛主席的诗词，原来觉得中国的古诗好也很喜欢，但总觉得过于悲观了。主席的诗很好，特别是有很多的解释。我最喜欢的两句诗：‘未有牺牲多壮志，敢叫日月换新天。’我第一次回国访问后回到美国去演讲，有一千多人听，最后我说这两句诗最能代表新中国的精神了。”谈到自己的岳父**杜聿明**（Du Yuming: 国民党高级将领），杨振宁又补充说：“他说国民党和共产党军队打仗一点希望都没有。他现在对于新中国有着坚强的信心，比我父亲强。”临行前，杨振宁还表达了自己的敬意：“毛主席，我在中国到处看到大家祝愿您万寿无疆的标语，我也要祝毛主席万寿无疆。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was Chen-Ning Yang's attitude towards this middle-school level rambling? Yang said with an admiring tone, 'Chairman, you see very far, you see the future of society. It is very important that you mention scientific experiments together with class struggle and production struggle.' A little later, Yang also expressed, 'I really like Chairman Mao's poems. I used to think classical Chinese poetry was good and liked it a lot, but always felt it was too pessimistic. The Chairman's poems are very good, especially with many explanations. My two favorite lines are: "With great aspirations, we've made many sacrifices; we dare to change the sun and moon for a new sky." The first time I returned to China and then went back to the United States to give a speech, over a thousand people listened. At the end, I said these two lines best represent the spirit of New China.' Speaking of his father-in-law, Du Yuming, Yang added, 'He said there was no hope for the Kuomintang and Communist armies fighting. Now he has strong confidence in New China, stronger than my father.' Before leaving, Yang also expressed his respect: 'Chairman Mao, I see slogans everywhere in China wishing you a long life. I also want to wish Chairman Mao a long life.'</p>
</details>

通篇看下来，我在**杨振宁**身上只看到两个字：谄媚。尤其是考虑到他的老师**饶毓泰**（Rao Yutai: 著名物理学家）、**叶企孙**（Ye Qisun: 著名物理学家、教育家）、**吴有训**（Wu Youxun: 著名物理学家），朋友**赵九章**（Zhao Jiuzhang: 著名地球物理学家）、**姚桐斌**（Yao Tongbin: 著名材料科学家）先后被迫害致死，好友**邓稼先**、**钱三强**（Qian Sanqiang: 著名核物理学家）、**王淦昌**（Wang Ganchang: 著名核物理学家）都不同程度遭到残酷迫害的情况下，这样的态度实在令人不齿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Reading through the entire piece, I only see two words in Yang: flattery. Especially considering that his teachers Rao Yutai, Ye Qisun, Wu Youxun, and friends Zhao Jiuzhang, Yao Tongbin were successively persecuted to death, and his close friends Deng Jiaxian, Qian Sanqiang, and Wang Ganchang all suffered cruel persecution to varying degrees, such an attitude is truly despicable.</p>
</details>

1976年毛泽东死后，**杨振宁**又在纽约毛泽东追悼大会上发表了题为**《人类历史上的一位巨人》**（A Giant in Human History: 杨振宁在毛泽东追悼会上的演讲）的演讲。演讲的链接我会稍后放在评论区。可以很确定地说，这篇文章出自中共的宣传口，因为那种歌功颂德、张口闭口“毛主席”、熟练引用毛泽东诗词和文章的马屁文风，只可能是常年写惯了党八股的御用文人才写得出来的，杨振宁就算有这个心也没这个能力。

It can be very certain that this article came from the CCP's propaganda department, because that kind of eulogizing, constantly mentioning 'Chairman Mao,' and skillfully quoting Mao Zedong's poems and articles—that sycophantic writing style could only be produced by a regime's official writer accustomed to writing Party jargon for years. Chen-Ning Yang, even if he had the intention, did not have the ability.</p>
</details>

### 杨振宁的“中国模式”论与军事科技贡献

**杨振宁**被诟病的第三件事，是他2011年回国以后接受**《南都专访》**（Southern Metropolis Daily Interview: 南方都市报的采访）的报道。这篇文章的标题很直白，就叫“杨振宁称中国模式胜于西方”。总结一下，在这段采访中他表达了几个观点：
第一，民主和科学的发展没有关系，中国能有现在的局面，最重要的贡献是因为有**中国共产党**。这里他说了这么句话：“在专制的体制下能不能有科研的发展？我说苏联当时是很专制，可他的科技发展有些方向是非常成功的。”那个记者又问他“一党执政是不是对科技发展不利？”到这个程度，我就知道他是**《苹果日报》**（Apple Daily: 香港已停刊的报纸）的了。“中国要是现在放弃一党执政的话，我认为对科技发展不利。”
除此以外，他还说21世纪后半年中国会变成世界第一大强国。20世纪最重要的、对人类历史有最长远影响的是有两件：一是人类利用科技大大增加生产力，二是中华民族站起来了。这个语气基本上已经和**王毅**（Wang Yi: 中国外交部长）之流没什么区别了。
除此以外，杨振宁在上世纪90年代的一些场合也曾经被迫承认过**大跃进**（Great Leap Forward: 中国1958-1962年间的经济和社会运动）、**文革**和**六四屠杀**（Tiananmen Square Massacre: 1989年中国政府对天安门广场示威者的武力镇压）的存在。但这些悲剧，包括几千万人的死亡，在他嘴里都变成了民族崛起道路上的一些必然代价，和他爸的观点是一样一样的。可以预见的是，如果杨振宁早年间回国，他在历次运动中的表现应该和**钱学森**无异，论证“亩产万斤”的怕是又要多一位。

<p class="english-text">The third thing Chen-Ning Yang was criticized for was his interview with Southern Metropolis Daily after returning to China in 2011. The article's title was very direct: 'Chen-Ning Yang Claims China Model Superior to West.' To summarize, in this interview, he expressed several viewpoints. First, he believed that there is no relationship between democracy and scientific development, and the most important contribution to China's current situation is due to the Chinese Communist Party. Here, he said, 'Can there be scientific development under an authoritarian system? I said that the Soviet Union was very authoritarian, but its technological development was very successful in some areas.' The reporter then asked me, 'Is one-party rule detrimental to scientific development?' At this point, I knew he was from Apple Daily. 'If China were to abandon one-party rule now, I believe it would be detrimental to scientific development.' In addition, he also said that in the latter half of the 21st century, China would become the world's number one superpower. The two most important things in the 20th century with the longest-term impact on human history were: first, humanity's use of technology to greatly increase productivity, and second, the rise of the Chinese nation. This tone is basically no different from that of Wang Yi and his ilk. Furthermore, Yang had also been forced to acknowledge the existence of the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the June Fourth Massacre on some occasions in the 1990s. But these tragedies, including the deaths of tens of millions of people, became 'inevitable costs' on the path to national rejuvenation in his mouth, exactly the same as his father's views. It is foreseeable that if Yang had returned to China earlier, his performance in various movements would have been no different from Qian Xuesen's; there would likely be one more person to argue for 'proletarian gold.'</p>

之前为**杨振宁**辩护的声音中，有一种说法是科学家很多都是政治冷感甚至政治白痴的，所以不要过分苛责。但我想说，这个观点起码并不适用于杨振宁，因为他一点也不冷感，更不白痴，他就是这个价值观。有人肯定要说了，就算这样，他也只是“嘴炮”，并没有真的做什么坏事。OK，接下来咱们就看看他具体都做了些什么。

<p class="english-text">Among the voices defending Chen-Ning Yang, there is an argument that many scientists are politically indifferent or even politically idiotic, so they should not be overly criticized. But I want to say that this view at least does not apply to Chen-Ning Yang, because he was not at all indifferent, nor was he idiotic; he simply held these values. Some people will surely say, 'Even so, he was just talking, he didn't actually do anything bad.' OK, next, let's see what he actually did.</p>

1986年，**杨振宁**推动在**南开大学**（Nankai University: 中国著名综合性研究型大学）**陈省身数学研究所**里建立起了理论物理研究室。1997年，他又推动创办了**清华大学**（Tsinghua University: 中国著名研究型大学）高等研究中心，任名誉主任。按**施一公**（Shi Yigong: 著名生物物理学家，清华大学教授）的说法，他是清华的“定海神针”，帮清华引进了一大批原本不可能回来的大师，其中包括**图灵奖**（Turing Award: 计算机科学领域的最高荣誉）获得者**姚期智**（Andrew Yao: 著名计算机科学家）和密码学家**王小云**（Wang Xiaoyun: 著名密码学家）。姚期智的加入将清华在理论计算机科学、量子计算等领域提升到了国际顶尖水平。而王小云则破解了广泛应用于美国政府、金融、国防等高敏感系统的核心加密算法。按官方的说法，他俩的研究成果直接保障了国防安全，是确保中国在未来信息战中保持优势、保护军事机密通信的关键。

<p class="english-text">In 1986, Chen-Ning Yang promoted the establishment of a theoretical physics research laboratory at the Shiing-Shen Chern Institute of Mathematics at Nankai University. In 1997, he further promoted the establishment of the Tsinghua University Institute for Advanced Study, serving as its honorary director. According to Shi Yigong, he was Tsinghua's 'stabilizing force,' helping Tsinghua attract a large number of masters who would otherwise not have returned, including Turing Award winner Andrew Yao and cryptographer Wang Xiaoyun. Yao's joining elevated Tsinghua to a top international level in theoretical computer science, quantum computing, and other fields. Wang Xiaoyun, on the other hand, cracked core encryption algorithms widely used in highly sensitive systems of the US government, finance, and defense. According to official statements, their research achievements directly ensured national defense security and were key to ensuring China's advantage in future information warfare and protecting military confidential communications.</p>

除此以外，**杨振宁**还在1997年到2005年之间多次上书中央，力主中国应该尽快发展**自由电子激光技术**（Free-Electron Laser Technology: 可用于高能激光武器、精确制导等军事领域）。该技术可直接应用于高能激光武器、精确制导、新型雷达以及新型军用材料的研发和制造。杨振宁的力推为中国占据这一军事技术制高点提供了先机。此外，杨振宁参与决策的**正负电子对撞机**（Electron-Positron Collider: 粒子加速器，可带动高技术设备研发），带动了中国高技术设备和精密仪器的研发和制造，大大增强了**中共**在军事雷达、电子对抗和技术方面的能力。

<p class="english-text">In addition, Yang also repeatedly appealed to the central government between 1997 and 2005, strongly advocating that China should accelerate the development of free-electron laser technology. This technology can be directly applied to the research and manufacturing of high-energy laser weapons, precision guidance, new types of radar, and new military materials. Yang's strong advocacy provided China with an early advantage in occupying this military technology high ground. Furthermore, the electron-positron collider, in whose decision-making Yang participated, drove the research and development and manufacturing of China's high-tech equipment and precision instruments, greatly enhancing the CCP's capabilities in military radar, electronic countermeasures, and technology.</p>

以上这些，如果你站在民族主义、宏大叙事的角度，可能会拍手叫好。但如果换位思考一下呢，他在做什么？在帮助一个直接威胁全世界、奴役本国民众的史上最邪恶的独裁政权备战。这和二战期间帮助**希特勒**（Adolf Hitler: 纳粹德国元首）助纣为虐研发核武器的**海森堡**（Werner Heisenberg: 著名物理学家，纳粹德国核计划负责人）和**维斯特克**（Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker: 著名物理学家，纳粹德国核计划参与者）有什么区别？如果你认为杨振宁做得对，请记住在纳粹分子眼里，海森堡们也是英雄，而**爱因斯坦**（Albert Einstein: 著名物理学家）才是那个背叛了国家的叛徒。

<p class="english-text">All of the above, if you look at it from a nationalist, grand narrative perspective, you might applaud. But if you put yourself in another's shoes, what was he doing? He was helping the most evil totalitarian regime in history, one that directly threatens the world and enslaves its own people, prepare for war. What is the difference between this and Heisenberg and Weizsäcker helping Hitler develop nuclear weapons during World War II? If you think Chen-Ning Yang did the right thing, remember that in the eyes of Nazis, Heisenbergs were heroes, and Einstein was the traitor who betrayed the country.</p>

### 结语：自由、爱国与灾难

节目的最后，我想对那些认为“虽然中共有问题，但杨振宁毕竟是在为国家和人民做贡献，帮助中国科技进步，培养了大批顶尖人才，这对我们也是有好处的”人说几句话：
第一，当自由极度匮乏时，民族主义就会成为情感与意义的廉价替代品，而对政权的忠诚将被伪装成对人民的热爱。
第二，当国家不正义时，爱国就会成为一切反人类行为的遮羞布。
第三，如果一座机器被设计的目的就是用来屠杀，那更多的人才、更高的效率、更坚固耐用并不会增加福祉，而是一场对于所有人的灾难，甚至包括这台机器的操作人员。

<p class="english-text">Finally, I want to say a few words to those who believe that although the CCP has problems, Yang was, after all, contributing to the country and the people, helping China's scientific and technological progress, and cultivating a large number of top talents, which is also beneficial to us. First, when freedom is extremely scarce, nationalism becomes a cheap substitute for emotion and meaning, and loyalty to the regime is disguised as love for the people. Second, when the state is unjust, patriotism becomes a fig leaf for all anti-human behaviors. Third, if a machine is designed for the purpose of slaughter, then more talent, higher efficiency, and greater durability will not increase well-being, but will be a disaster for everyone, including the operators of this machine.</p>
