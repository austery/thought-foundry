### 引言：对杨振宁及类似学者的态度

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说，我是夸克。前两天，103岁的杨振宁去世了。大家可能留意到，在我讲述他的死讯时，我用了最基础的叙述方式，没有一堆头衔，没有任何尊称，也没有使用“去世”、“过世”、“仙游”一类较为婉转的说法，就是“某某某死了”。这基本上代表了我对他的态度，也是我对包括钱学森、邓稼先等一批中共叙事中所极力推崇、褒扬乃至捧上神坛的理工科领域学者们的态度。接下来，我会分成两段来解释为什么我会有这样的态度。前半部分，我会尝试探索一下科学与伦理、科学家的个人良知和研究工作之间的关系。节目的后半段，我会因部分网友的要求，给您仔细讲讲杨振宁都做了些什么，然后您自己判断我该不该鄙视他。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says, I'm Quark. A few days ago, 103-year-old Chen-Ning Yang passed away. You might have noticed that when I spoke of his death, I used the most basic narrative, without a string of titles, no honorifics, and no euphemisms like "passed away," "departed," or "ascended to immortality"; I simply said "so-and-so died." This largely represents my attitude towards him, and also my attitude towards a group of scholars in the fields of science and engineering—including Qian Xuesen and Deng Jiaxian—whom the CCP's narrative vigorously promotes, praises, and even elevates to a divine status. Next, I will explain in two parts why I hold such an attitude. In the first half, I will attempt to explore the relationship between science and ethics, a scientist's personal conscience, and their research work. In the latter half of the program, at the request of some netizens, I will elaborate on what Chen-Ning Yang actually did, and then you can judge for yourself whether I should despise him.</p>

### 科学、伦理与良知：道德与良知的区别

我之前在推特和YouTube的帖子里发了一些我对杨振宁等人的看法。在为之辩护的声音里，有一类说法很常见，也就是“科学是中立的，你不能道德绑架要求科学家做道德完人”。这里我先解释两句，因为我经常会看到有人滥用“**道德绑架**”（Moral Blackmail: 指以道德或情感为由，强迫他人接受某种观点或做出某种行为）这个说法。但杨振宁、钱学森之类的问题，很大程度上不在道德，而在于良知。道德和良知都是人类社会和个体精神生活的基础，但两者又有着显著区别。这个区别就在于，道德是和特定环境相关联的，而良知是普世的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I previously posted some of my views on Chen-Ning Yang and others on Twitter and YouTube. Among the voices defending them, a common argument is that "science is neutral; you cannot morally blackmail scientists into being moral paragons." Here, I'd like to clarify a couple of points, as I often see people misusing the term "moral blackmail." However, the issues with figures like Chen-Ning Yang and Qian Xuesen largely lie not in morality, but in conscience. Both morality and conscience are fundamental to human society and individual spiritual life, yet they have significant differences. The distinction is that morality is associated with specific environments, while conscience is universal.</p>
</details>

不好理解吗？我举个例子。比如说，贞洁这个东西是前工业时代特别看重的道德标准。在那个道德体系下，一个女生未婚就和人发生了性关系，这叫失贞，是能要人命的，对吧？但在今天，这还算个事吗？所以才会有“旧道德”一说嘛，说明什么？说明道德是很容易变的，是可以被教育塑造的。但良知就不同了，良知是源于内心深处的。比如“不能强奸”这个事，你放到任何时代都成立，即便你从没受过教育，也知道这是不对的，因为它违反了对方的自由意志嘛。道德和良知有时候是一致的，但也有时候不那么一致，甚至截然相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that hard to understand? Let me give an example. For instance, chastity was a highly valued moral standard in pre-industrial times. Under that moral system, if an unmarried woman had sexual relations, it was called a loss of chastity and could be fatal, right? But today, is that still a big deal? That's why there's a concept of "old morality," which indicates what? It shows that morality is easily changed and can be shaped by education. But conscience is different; conscience stems from deep within. For example, "thou shalt not rape" holds true in any era; even if you've never been educated, you know it's wrong because it violates the other person's free will. Morality and conscience sometimes align, but sometimes they don't, and can even be diametrically opposed.</p>
</details>

比如，按照党特有的道德标准——党性高于人性、组织纪律高于自由意志、集体主义高于个人利益。按这套道德标准，如果你是个士兵，党让你朝学生和老乡们开枪，你就得开，这才是道德的、顾全大局的，你必须收起你的良知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, according to the Party's unique moral standards—Party spirit above human nature, organizational discipline above free will, collectivism above individual interests. By these moral standards, if you are a soldier and the Party orders you to shoot at students and fellow citizens, you must do it. That is considered moral and upholding the greater good; you must suppress your conscience.</p>
</details>

### 工具理性与价值理性：科学中立的迷思

好了，讨论完两者的区别，再来谈谈所谓的科学中立。**马克思·韦伯**（Max Weber: 德国著名社会学家、哲学家，著有《新教伦理与资本主义精神》）就是那个写出了《新教伦理与资本主义精神》的大神。在他的著作《经济与社会》的第一章，就石破天惊地提出了一对概念，叫**工具理性**（Instrumental Rationality: 关注如何高效达成目标，不问目标本身是否合理）和**价值理性**（Value Rationality: 关注行动本身是否符合某种内在价值或伦理）。咱们通俗解释一下：所谓工具理性就是“how”，怎么做；而价值理性是“why”，为什么做，这么做是对的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alright, having discussed the distinction between the two, let's now talk about the so-called scientific neutrality. Max Weber, the great mind who wrote "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," in the first chapter of his work "Economy and Society," startlingly introduced a pair of concepts: instrumental rationality and value rationality. To explain them simply: instrumental rationality is about "how" to do something; while value rationality is about "why" to do it, and whether doing it is right.</p>
</details>

前者就像是一台高效而冷酷的机器，它关注的是为了达到一个既定的目标，我们应该采取什么手段，怎么样才能用最少成本、最快的速度、最高效的方式完成。它不关心目标本身是不是好的，只关心能不能行和划不划算。而价值理性呢？它关注的是行动本身是否符合某种内在价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The former is like an efficient and cold machine; its focus is on what means we should adopt to achieve a given goal with the least cost, fastest speed, and most efficient method. It doesn't care whether the goal itself is good, only whether it's feasible and cost-effective. And value rationality? It focuses on whether the action itself aligns with certain intrinsic values.</p>
</details>

举个最简单的例子：如果你是纳粹时期的德国军官，上头给你的命令是把犹太人这些人都屠杀了。工具理性的人会立马开始计算该怎么屠杀效率最高、处理起来成本最低，是用子弹、炸药还是毒气。而价值理性的人会感到煎熬，甚至拒绝执行这样的命令，因为它违反了你的良知。如果一个科学家在非常清楚自己所作所为会带来什么影响的前提下，还参与并且高效完成了毒气的研究，事后解释说“科学是中立的，我只关心毒气扩散的速度和对人体的影响，不要对我道德绑架”，这个解释你能接受吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To give a simple example: if you were a German officer during the Nazi era, and your superiors ordered you to exterminate all the Jews. A person driven by instrumental rationality would immediately begin calculating the most efficient and cost-effective way to carry out the massacre, whether using bullets, explosives, or poison gas. A person driven by value rationality, however, would feel tormented, and might even refuse to execute such an order because it violates their conscience. If a scientist, fully aware of the implications of their actions, participated in and efficiently completed research on poison gas, and then later explained, "Science is neutral; I only cared about the speed of gas diffusion and its effects on the human body, don't morally blackmail me," would you accept that explanation?</p>
</details>

### 极权主义下的“螺丝钉”与平庸之恶

我之前曾经多次提到过**汉娜·阿伦特**（Hannah Arendt: 20世纪重要的政治思想家，提出了“平庸之恶”的概念）的**平庸之恶**（Banality of Evil: 指在极权体制下，普通人无意识地服从命令，参与作恶，却不认为自己有罪）的概念。所有极权主义的国家机器都有大批这种信奉技术中立、工具理性，从而放弃了良知的执行者。这也是为什么党，无论是纳粹党还是共产党，都会不遗余力地宣传“螺丝钉精神”的原因，因为“螺丝钉”是不需要大脑的，只要忠实完成任务就可以了。至于这个任务是不是邪恶、是不是犯罪，和你无关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have previously mentioned Hannah Arendt's concept of the banality of evil multiple times. All totalitarian state apparatuses have a large number of executors who believe in technological neutrality and instrumental rationality, thereby abandoning their conscience. This is why the Party, whether the Nazi Party or the Communist Party, spares no effort to promote the "screw spirit," because a "screw" doesn't need a brain; it just needs to faithfully complete its task. Whether this task is evil or criminal is irrelevant to you.</p>
</details>

同时，因为螺丝钉太多，大家都一样，这极大地消解和稀释了每个螺丝钉的罪恶感，因为你会觉得“我只是在完成分内工作，有什么错呢？”这也是为什么中国参与过计划生育的妇产科医生们申请美签和移民时，基本上百分之百会被拒的原因。而且这些人往往还都挺委屈，觉得“我只是奉命行事，这能怪我吗？”但在签证官看来，你就是大屠杀的帮凶，因为你放弃了良知。了解了以上的逻辑，我们再来看看杨振宁是否符合上面的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, because there are so many "screws" and everyone is the same, this greatly dissipates and dilutes the sense of guilt of each "screw," because you might think, "I'm just doing my job, what's wrong with that?" This is also why obstetricians and gynecologists in China who participated in the one-child policy are almost 100% rejected when applying for U.S. visas and immigration. Moreover, these individuals often feel quite wronged, thinking, "I was just following orders, how can I be blamed?" But in the eyes of the visa officer, you are an accomplice to genocide because you abandoned your conscience. Having understood the above logic, let's now examine whether Chen-Ning Yang fits this definition.</p>
</details>

### 评价人物的逻辑谬误：成就与人品应分开审视

这里多插一句，简中网络有个很不好的习惯，就是评价一个人的时候喜欢把人品和能力成就混为一谈，只接受单一的评价。比如在评价杨振宁的时候，我听到最多反驳的声音就是“杨老的成就如何如何伟大，是载入历史史册的人物，你还没资格评价他”。这就属于典型的逻辑谬误啊！他学术上有多少成就和人品如何有关系吗？举个例子，假设一个名厨做饭很好吃，同时又强奸了幼女，你能不能因为他做菜做得好就来一句“他可是拿过国际大奖的国宝级厨师，批评他你还不够格”吗？显然不行。反过来一样，你不能因为他人品卑劣就连带着不承认他在专业领域的才能。对一个人的评价从来就应该是分成多个层次，一码归一码的。这也是我一直以来的态度。你看我之前做节目评价王菊，也不会因为她有过家暴就影响对她业务能力的判断。我说她不是个好记者，纯粹就是因为她业务能力真的拉胯。说回杨振宁，接下来咱就详细说说他到底是个怎样的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me interject here: there's a bad habit on the simplified Chinese internet of conflating a person's character with their abilities and achievements, accepting only a single evaluation. For example, when evaluating Chen-Ning Yang, the most common rebuttal I hear is, "Elder Yang's achievements are so great, he's a figure recorded in history, you're not qualified to judge him." This is a typical logical fallacy! What does his academic achievement have to do with his character? For instance, suppose a famous chef cooks delicious food but also rapes a minor. Can you say, "He's a national treasure chef who has won international awards, you're not qualified to criticize him" just because he cooks well? Obviously not. The reverse is also true: you cannot deny his professional talent just because his character is despicable. The evaluation of a person should always be multi-layered, separating one thing from another. This has always been my attitude. For example, when I evaluated Wang Ju in my previous programs, I wouldn't let her history of domestic violence affect my judgment of her professional ability. I said she wasn't a good journalist purely because her professional ability was genuinely poor. Back to Chen-Ning Yang, let's now discuss in detail what kind of person he truly was.</p>
</details>

### 杨振宁的家庭背景与父亲杨武之的价值观

1922年，杨振宁出生在安徽合肥一个**书香世家**（Scholarly Family: 指世代以读书为业，有深厚文化底蕴的家庭）。父亲**杨武之**（Wu-Chih Yang: 著名数学家，杨振宁的父亲）早年曾公费留学斯坦福大学和芝加哥大学，是中国首个因研究数论而获得博士学位的数学家，还是陈省身和华罗庚的老师。之所以特别提到杨武之，是因为杨振宁本人的价值观很大程度上受到他父亲的影响。了解了他的父亲，你大概就能看清楚他本人的底色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1922, Chen-Ning Yang was born into a scholarly family in Hefei, Anhui. His father, Wu-Chih Yang, had studied abroad at Stanford University and the University of Chicago on a government scholarship in his early years. He was the first Chinese mathematician to receive a doctorate for research in number theory and was also a teacher to Shiing-Shen Chern and Hua Luogeng. The reason I specifically mention Wu-Chih Yang is that Chen-Ning Yang's own values were largely influenced by his father. Understanding his father will likely give you a clear picture of Chen-Ning Yang's fundamental character.</p>
</details>

那杨武之是个什么样的人呢？这里可以说几件事。第一，杨武之自幼父母双亡，是跟着叔叔长大的。他甚至连自己母亲的名字都不知道。回忆起母亲时，只有一件事令他印象深刻，就是母亲经常搂着他们兄弟俩说：“你们俩一定要好好读书，将来去做官，才不会被人瞧不起，才不会受人欺负。”后来，他也经常给杨振宁和其他的孩子们讲述这段经历，用来激励鞭策他们，让他们好好读书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what kind of person was Wu-Chih Yang? I can tell you a few things. First, Wu-Chih Yang's parents both died when he was young, and he was raised by his uncle. He didn't even know his mother's name. When he recalled his mother, only one thing left a deep impression: his mother often hugged him and his brother, saying, "You two must study hard, and in the future, become officials so you won't be looked down upon or bullied." Later, he often recounted this experience to Chen-Ning Yang and his other children, using it to motivate and encourage them to study diligently.</p>
</details>

第二，杨武之出国留学前，曾在安徽省立安庆中学担任老师兼舍监，因过于严厉而和学生们发生了冲突，愤而辞职，随后出国留学。出国前，他留下了一张和刚一岁儿子的合影。合影里，他依旧穿着旧式的长袍马褂，而不是当时流行的西装或者中山装。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second, before studying abroad, Wu-Chih Yang worked as a teacher and dormitory supervisor at Anqing Provincial Middle School in Anhui. Due to his excessive strictness, he had conflicts with students, resigned in anger, and then went abroad to study. Before leaving, he took a photo with his one-year-old son. In the photo, he was still wearing a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket, rather than the popular Western suits or Zhongshan suits of the time.</p>
</details>

第三，根据杨振宁回忆，家里有很多英文和德文书，但父亲并不鼓励他看，反而是请人到家里来教他《孟子》和一些国学方面的书。父亲私下也会教杨振宁唱歌，全都是民国初年的一些爱国歌曲，像是石庚的《中国男儿》和李叔同的《祖国歌》。《中国男儿》唱道：“中国男儿，中国男儿，要将只手撑天空。长江大河，亚洲之东，巍巍昆仑，一脉长城。天赋之国，之都永弘，皇帝之州，神明中。”多提一句，杨振宁的发小兼邻居邓稼先也差不多，他爸从小教他的是四书五经、忠孝节义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, according to Chen-Ning Yang's recollections, there were many English and German books at home, but his father did not encourage him to read them. Instead, he hired someone to teach him "Mencius" and other traditional Chinese classics. His father would also privately teach Chen-Ning Yang to sing, all patriotic songs from the early Republic of China, such as Shi Geng's "Chinese Sons" and Li Shutong's "Song of the Motherland." "Chinese Sons" sings: "Chinese sons, Chinese sons, with one hand support the sky. Yangtze River, great rivers, east of Asia, majestic Kunlun, a continuous Great Wall. A land bestowed by heaven, its capital forever grand, the emperor's domain, among the gods." To add, Chen-Ning Yang's childhood friend and neighbor, Deng Jiaxian, was similar; his father taught him the Four Books and Five Classics, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness from a young age.</p>
</details>

第四，杨振宁从小就很有数学天赋，多次向父亲求教解析几何和微积分方面的问题，但父亲不但不教，还反对他学数学专业，理由是数学不实用。听完这件事，你对杨振宁的这位教授父亲是个什么样的人，应该已经有初步了解了。我们可以用以下几个词来描述他的底层价值观：**世故达观**（Worldly-wise and Philosophical: 指对世事洞明，态度超然，但可能带有功利色彩）、**功利主义**（Utilitarianism: 强调以结果为导向，追求最大化利益的哲学思想）、**民族主义**（Nationalism: 强调国家或民族的利益高于一切的意识形态），满脑子**宏大叙事**（Grand Narrative: 指对历史或社会发展的一种全面、普遍且具有目的性的解释框架）。可以这么说，尽管他去美国留过学，但或许是因为学的是数学而不是人文社科专业的原因，他骨子里依然是一个典型的那个年代的中式小知识分子，和毛泽东这类人差不多。关于这一点，在他后来三次劝说儿子杨振宁回大陆报效祖国时，则表现得更为明显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fourth, Chen-Ning Yang showed great mathematical talent from a young age and repeatedly sought his father's guidance on analytical geometry and calculus. However, his father not only refused to teach him but also opposed his studying mathematics as a major, arguing that mathematics was impractical. After hearing this, you should have a preliminary understanding of what kind of person Chen-Ning Yang's professor father was. We can describe his underlying values with the following terms: worldly-wise and philosophical, utilitarianism, nationalism, and a mind full of grand narratives. It can be said that despite studying in the United States, perhaps because he studied mathematics rather than humanities or social sciences, he remained at heart a typical Chinese intellectual of that era, similar to figures like Mao Zedong. This became even more evident when he later tried three times to persuade his son, Chen-Ning Yang, to return to mainland China to serve the motherland.</p>
</details>

### 杨武之的三次“统战”：劝子归国背后的功利与伪善

说起这段经历，还颇有点戏剧性。1957年，杨振宁和李政道一起获得诺贝尔奖。中共和台湾方面都派人接洽游说。杨武之主动提出要去游说杨振宁回国，并得到了**周恩来**（Zhou Enlai: 中华人民共和国首任总理）和**统战部**（United Front Work Department: 中共中央负责统一战线工作的部门，旨在争取和团结党外人士）的批准。杨武之的游说一共进行了三次，分别是1957年、1960年和1962年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of this experience, it was quite dramatic. In 1957, Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee jointly received the Nobel Prize. Both the CCP and Taiwan sent people to contact and lobby them. Wu-Chih Yang proactively offered to persuade Chen-Ning Yang to return to China and received approval from Zhou Enlai and the United Front Work Department. Wu-Chih Yang's lobbying efforts took place three times, in 1957, 1960, and 1962.</p>
</details>

第一次，杨武之对儿子是这么说的：“即便你因为某些原因暂时不能回国，那也绝对不要去台湾。眼下的形势是大陆会一天天强盛起来，而台湾会慢慢萎缩下去，这就是未来的大趋势。”是不是听着有点耳熟啊？当然，这话除了有明显的功利意味外，还多少带着点胁迫，意思是“如果你去了台湾，我们一家老小可就你掂量着办吧”。这次的游说没能成功，一个最直接的原因是当时席卷中国的**反右运动**（Anti-Rightist Campaign: 1957年中共发起的政治运动，旨在打击所谓“右派分子”）。另一位受周恩来指派前去“挖人”的物理学家**张文玉**（Zhang Wenyu: 中国著名物理学家）也感受到这一点。据他回忆，他第一次去诺奖颁奖现场和杨、李二人会面时，两人还比较热情，说了些“感谢祖国的关心，我们现在还年轻，争取工作一段时间之后再回国”的话。等到了1958年，再赴日内瓦给他俩做工作时，杨、李二人就明显没那么热情了。显然，他俩都知道国内发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first time, Wu-Chih Yang told his son, "Even if you cannot return to China temporarily for some reason, you absolutely must not go to Taiwan. The current situation is that the mainland will grow stronger day by day, while Taiwan will gradually shrink. This is the future trend." Does that sound a bit familiar? Of course, besides the obvious utilitarian implications, these words also carried a hint of coercion, meaning, "If you go to Taiwan, our whole family's fate rests on your decision." This lobbying effort failed, and one of the most direct reasons was the Anti-Rightist Campaign sweeping across China at the time. Another physicist, Zhang Wenyu, dispatched by Zhou Enlai to "recruit" them, also felt this. According to his recollection, when he first met Yang and Li at the Nobel Prize ceremony, both were quite enthusiastic, saying things like, "Thank you for the motherland's concern, we are still young, and we will strive to return after working for some time." By 1958, when he went to Geneva again to work on them, Yang and Li were noticeably less enthusiastic. Clearly, they both knew what was happening in China.</p>
</details>

杨武之的第二、第三次游说就更加没底气了。这两次游说都处于**三年大饥荒**（Great Chinese Famine: 1959-1961年间中国发生的严重饥荒，导致数千万人死亡）时期。杨武之虽然极力粉饰，但终究是纸包不住火。这里还有个小插曲：有一天晚上，我父亲就跟我介绍中国怎么样，他说中国现在怎么好怎么好，他说从前中国一根针都不会做，他说现在不但是针能够做，现在可以做桥、可以做飞机，然后这样好那样好。我母亲在旁边就插过来说：“你不要误导儿子，我现在要前几天出去要买几块豆腐，占了四个钟头的队，还只买了几块馊掉的豆腐，这有什么好？”这个讲了以后，我父亲非常生气，我父亲说：“你竟给振宁错误的消息！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wu-Chih Yang's second and third lobbying attempts were even less confident. Both of these attempts took place during the Great Chinese Famine. Although Wu-Chih Yang tried his best to gloss over the situation, the truth eventually came out. Here's a small anecdote: one evening, my father was telling me how great China was. He said China was so good now, that in the past, China couldn't even make a needle, but now it could not only make needles but also bridges and airplanes, and so on. My mother, standing nearby, interjected, "Don't mislead our son. A few days ago, I went out to buy some tofu, queued for four hours, and only managed to buy a few pieces of spoiled tofu. What's so good about that?" After she said this, my father became very angry. My father said, "You're giving Zhenning false information!"</p>
</details>

有人可能会以为杨武之会这么睁眼说瞎话，可能是因为他住在象牙塔里，不知道农村饿死了几千万人。但实际情况是，对于中国的现状他非常清楚。据杨振宁的弟弟**杨振翰**（Yang Zhenhan: 杨振宁的弟弟）回忆，杨武之第二次游说失败回国后曾对他表示：“你母亲给你大哥讲了上海生活的真实情况，我非常矛盾。虽然她讲的都是实情，但你母亲没有大局观，不能长远地看问题，导致我没机会把我对中国未来的完整预测讲给你大哥，听说服他回国。”如果说第二次“**统战**”（United Front: 中共通过各种手段争取和团结党外人士，以实现其政治目标的策略）杨武之还抱有些困难只是暂时的侥幸心理的话，第三次劝说时他就已经完全是在说伪心话、诓骗儿子了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might think Wu-Chih Yang was speaking nonsense with his eyes wide open because he lived in an ivory tower and was unaware that tens of millions had starved to death in the countryside. However, the reality was that he was very clear about China's true situation. According to Chen-Ning Yang's younger brother, Yang Zhenhan, Wu-Chih Yang once told him after his second failed lobbying attempt to return to China: "Your mother told your elder brother the true situation of life in Shanghai, and I was very conflicted. Although what she said was true, your mother lacked a broader perspective and couldn't see the long-term picture, which prevented me from having the opportunity to share my complete prediction for China's future with your elder brother and persuade him to return." If Wu-Chih Yang's second "United Front" effort was driven by a temporary, somewhat hopeful but difficult mindset, by the third attempt, he was entirely speaking disingenuously and deceiving his son.</p>
</details>

因为就在他劝说失败、对杨母大发脾气之后，他对子女们又说出了心里话：“我现在很矛盾，国内现在各方面都有些失序，我该怎么开口劝说振宁回来呢？你母亲说他回来不仅没法做研究、得不到诺贝尔奖，还会受到冲击。你母亲说的是对的，但他老留在美国，美国政府又老是与中国为敌，我们都住在国内，长此以往如何是好？”这里多说一句，就在那几年，杨武之在芝加哥大学的校友、另一位诺贝尔物理学奖获得者**崔琦**（Daniel Chee Tsui: 华裔美国物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖得主）的父亲在河南平舆山农村被活活饿死。数年后的文革，母亲又因为儿子在美国被控“里通外国”迫害致死。而李政道的铁哥们、同样毕业于芝加哥大学的**乌宁昆**（Wu Ningkun: 著名翻译家，曾被打为“极右分子”）博士，自在归国以后被划成“极右分子”，进了劳改营，此时正在清河农场三分厂负责清理因为大饥荒饿死的人的尸体。在这种情况下，一个父亲居然还能舔着脸把亲生儿子往火坑里推，同样身为人父的我只能用一句话来形容他：**党性盖过人性**（Party Spirit Overrides Human Nature: 指在中共体制下，对党的忠诚和服从超越了基本的人性、亲情和道德）。纵观杨武之的言行，你会发现个很有意思的现象，那就是尽管他身为数学家，数理逻辑能力应该是很强的，但看待现实问题时，逻辑几乎是零分。

<p class="english-text">Because right after his failed persuasion and his outburst at Yang's mother, he confided in his children: "I am very conflicted now; various aspects of the country are in disorder. How can I possibly persuade Zhenning to return? Your mother says that if he comes back, he won't be able to do research, won't get a Nobel Prize, and will face persecution. Your mother is right, but if he stays in America, and the American government is always hostile to China, and we all live in China, what will become of us in the long run?" To add, in those very years, the father of Daniel Chee Tsui, a fellow alumnus of Wu-Chih Yang at the University of Chicago and another Nobel laureate in Physics, was starved to death in the rural Pingyushan area of Henan. Years later, during the Cultural Revolution, Tsui's mother was persecuted to death, accused of "colluding with foreign enemies" because her son was in America. Meanwhile, Dr. Wu Ningkun, Tsung-Dao Lee's close friend and also a University of Chicago graduate, was labeled an "ultra-rightist" after returning to China, sent to a labor camp, and was at that time responsible for clearing the bodies of those who had starved to death during the Great Famine at the Qinghe Farm's third branch. Under such circumstances, a father could still shamelessly push his own son into a fiery pit. As a father myself, I can only describe him with one phrase: Party spirit overrides human nature. Looking at Wu-Chih Yang's words and actions, you'll find an interesting phenomenon: despite being a mathematician with strong logical and mathematical abilities, his logic was almost zero when it came to real-world issues.</p>

### 父子价值观的传承：从家国同构到“谁赢了谁就是我主子”

比如，他在首次劝说儿子回国失败后，给儿子儿媳留下这么一幅字：“美范勿忘亲爱，勇有声音感国恩红光。”这两句屁话就如同280个大耳刮子。前一句是典型的**道德绑架**加**情感勒索**（Emotional Blackmail: 指通过操纵情感来控制他人行为），“美范勿忘”是时时刻刻暗示儿子忘恩负义，将亲情转化成债务，让他生活在愧疚之中，压抑他的独立人格发展。而后半句则是逻辑混乱的**家国同构**（State-Family Analogy: 指将家庭伦理平移到国家治理，要求民众对国家像对家庭一样忠诚），将家庭内部的孝道和报恩伦理平移到政权，要求对方无条件服从。用今天的话说，就是“勿忘咱妈，感谢国家”。但杨武之的言行比上文这句还要恶劣，因为即便你真的要感谢国家，杨家父子要感恩的也应该是中华民国，因为你俩都是国民政府的公派留学生，出国前白纸黑字签了契约，就算要报效祖国也应该去台湾。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For example, after his first failed attempt to persuade his son to return to China, he left a couplet for his son and daughter-in-law: "Do not forget the love of family, bravely voice gratitude for national grace and red light." These two lines of nonsense are like 280 slaps in the face. The first line is a typical example of moral blackmail combined with emotional blackmail; "Do not forget the love" constantly implies that his son is ungrateful, transforming familial affection into a debt, making him live in guilt and suppressing the development of his independent personality. The latter half is a logically confused state-family analogy, transferring the internal family ethics of filial piety and gratitude to the political regime, demanding unconditional obedience. In today's terms, it's "Don't forget Mom, thank the country." But Wu-Chih Yang's words and actions were even worse than this, because even if you genuinely wanted to thank the country, the Yang father and son should have been grateful to the Republic of China, as both were government-sponsored students sent abroad by the Nationalist government, having signed contracts in black and white before leaving. Even if they were to serve the motherland, it should have been Taiwan.</p>
</details>

如果按照旧道德的标准，杨武之的这个行为大概就相当于明末施琅、黄粱的士大夫，清军一入关就主动投诚，不仅自己投敌，还转头告诫儿子要效忠大清，对顺治皇帝感恩戴德。这背后的逻辑，一言以蔽之：谁赢了谁就是我主子。之所以花这么多笔墨来谈杨武之，是因为纵观杨振宁一生的所作所为，几乎全盘继承了他父亲的价值观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to old moral standards, Wu-Chih Yang's actions would be akin to those literati like Shi Lang and Huang Liang at the end of the Ming Dynasty who, as soon as the Qing army entered the passes, actively surrendered. Not only did they defect themselves, but they also turned around and admonished their sons to pledge allegiance to the Qing Dynasty and be grateful to Emperor Shunzhi. The logic behind this, in a nutshell, is: whoever wins is my master. The reason I've spent so much ink discussing Wu-Chih Yang is that, looking at Chen-Ning Yang's actions throughout his life, he almost entirely inherited his father's values.</p>

### 杨振宁与李政道恩怨：诺奖署名与决裂始末

杨振宁做的第一件有争议的事，是和**李政道**（Tsung-Dao Lee: 华裔美国物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖得主）之间的恩怨。1972年李政道回国，当时杨武之正在华东医院住院。听说李也在上海，特意请他到医院见面。见面以后，他握住李政道的手说：“很清楚，振宁和你1962年决裂的经过是振宁对不起你。你们都是天下的奇才，但为了中国下一代的学子，还请你原谅他。”你看，都到这会儿了，还是个老糊涂，逻辑混乱。杨振宁对不起你李政道，跟中国下一代的学子有什么关系呢？八竿子打不着啊。那杨振宁到底做了什么对不起李政道的事呢？以下咱们详细解说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first controversial thing Chen-Ning Yang did was his feud with Tsung-Dao Lee. In 1972, Tsung-Dao Lee returned to China, and at that time, Wu-Chih Yang was hospitalized at Huadong Hospital. Hearing that Lee was also in Shanghai, he specifically invited him to meet at the hospital. After meeting, he shook Tsung-Dao Lee's hand and said, "It's very clear that the breakup between Zhenning and you in 1962 was Zhenning's fault. You are both extraordinary talents, but for the sake of China's next generation of students, please forgive him." You see, even at this point, he was still a muddled old man, with confused logic. What does Chen-Ning Yang wronging Tsung-Dao Lee have to do with China's next generation of students? They are completely unrelated. So, what exactly did Chen-Ning Yang do to wrong Tsung-Dao Lee? Let's explain in detail below.</p>
</details>

先说李政道这哥们，是真正的物理天才。26岁就成了哥伦比亚大学的助理教授，29岁就成了哥伦比亚大学200年历史上最年轻的郑教授。赴美留学以后，因为杨既是他西南联大时期的师兄，又是同行，两人很快就熟络起来。1956年，李政道在研究当时物理学公认的**西塔-陶疑点**（Theta-Tau Puzzle: 物理学中关于K介子衰变模式的未解之谜，促成了宇称不守恒理论的提出）时，产生了一个大胆的猜想：弱相互作用下**宇称守恒定律**（Parity Conservation Law: 物理学中一个基本对称性原理，认为物理定律在空间反演下不变）可能不成立，也就是后来获得诺奖的**宇称不守恒**（Parity Nonconservation: 指在弱相互作用中，宇称对称性被破坏的现象）的核心观点。因为他之前跟杨振宁合作过几次，这次就又拉上他来聊。杨一开始表示反对，但聊了一阵以后，很快就被李政道说服了。随后，李政道又找到了有“中国居里夫人”之称的另一位实验物理学家**吴健雄**（Chien-Shiung Wu: 华裔美国物理学家，通过实验证实了宇称不守恒）合作，帮忙实验论证。最终，李、杨二人共同凭这一成果获得诺奖。需要说明的是，这个奖吴健雄女士也完全是有资格拿的，没给她颁奖也是诺奖历史上极有争议的一次事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, let's talk about Tsung-Dao Lee, a true physics genius. At 26, he became an assistant professor at Columbia University, and at 29, he became the youngest full professor in Columbia University's 200-year history. After studying in the U.S., because Yang was both his senior from Southwest Associated University and a colleague, the two quickly became acquainted. In 1956, while researching the then-recognized Theta-Tau Puzzle in physics, Tsung-Dao Lee had a bold conjecture: that the Parity Conservation Law might not hold true under weak interactions, which became the core idea of Parity Nonconservation, later earning them the Nobel Prize. Because he had collaborated with Chen-Ning Yang several times before, he brought him in to discuss it again. Yang initially expressed opposition but was quickly convinced by Tsung-Dao Lee after some discussion. Subsequently, Tsung-Dao Lee sought collaboration from another experimental physicist, Chien-Shiung Wu, known as "China's Madame Curie," to help with experimental verification. Ultimately, Lee and Yang jointly received the Nobel Prize for this achievement. It should be noted that Ms. Wu was fully qualified to receive this award, and the failure to award her was one of the most controversial events in Nobel Prize history.</p>
</details>

但就在获奖前夕，杨振宁突然提出了文章署名顺序的问题，说希望把自己的名字排在前面。这个说法让李政道很吃惊，因为按照国际惯例，论文署名通常遵循两个原则。首先是贡献原则，贡献大的排前面。如果贡献难以比较，就按照姓氏首字母原则。两人前后合作了十多篇论文，除了1952年的首次合作外，一直都是李在前。而这次的成果核心创意和观点是李政道提出来的，找吴健雄合作论证猜想也是李提出来的，李担任的是项目经理的角色。无论按哪个标准，都应该是李在前、杨在后。但杨振宁有自己的一套歪理，说自己比李政道大，按中国人的规矩应该自己在前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, just before receiving the award, Chen-Ning Yang suddenly raised the issue of authorship order, stating he wished his name to be placed first. This surprised Tsung-Dao Lee, as international custom for paper authorship generally follows two principles. First is the contribution principle, where the greater contributor is listed first. If contributions are hard to compare, then the alphabetical order by surname is followed. The two had collaborated on over a dozen papers, and except for their first collaboration in 1952, Lee's name had always appeared first. For this particular achievement, the core idea and viewpoint were proposed by Tsung-Dao Lee, and it was also Lee who suggested collaborating with Chien-Shiung Wu to experimentally verify the conjecture; Lee acted as the project manager. By any standard, Lee should have been listed first, followed by Yang. But Chen-Ning Yang had his own twisted logic, arguing that since he was older than Tsung-Dao Lee, his name should come first according to Chinese custom.</p>
</details>

明眼人都能看出来这是个托词，你又不是今天才突然大了四岁，之前之后你怎么不提呢？杨此时真实的心理很可能是因为当时的他并没有什么重大的学术成就，他的**杨-米尔斯规范场理论**（Yang-Mills Gauge Theory: 描述基本粒子间相互作用的物理理论，由杨振宁和罗伯特·米尔斯共同提出）还没有被发掘出来。拿诺奖当然就是最重大的荣誉了，所以哪怕厚着脸皮也得争一下。多说一句，杨最引以为傲的杨-米尔斯规范场论，他和**米尔斯**（Robert Mills: 美国物理学家，与杨振宁共同提出杨-米尔斯规范场理论）的关系就和宇称不守恒里他和李政道的关系一样，只是反过来了。他提出核心创意和观点，米尔斯作为合作方。今天墙内一提到杨-米尔斯，都说米尔斯只是杨的助手。按这个标准的话，拿诺奖的宇称不守恒，杨也算是李的助手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyone with a clear mind could see this was a pretext; you didn't suddenly become four years older today, so why didn't you bring it up before or after? Yang's true motivation at the time was likely that he hadn't yet achieved any major academic breakthroughs; his Yang-Mills Gauge Theory had not yet been fully recognized. Winning the Nobel Prize was, of course, the greatest honor, so he had to contend for it, even if it meant being shameless. To add, for Yang's most proud achievement, the Yang-Mills Gauge Theory, his relationship with Mills was the inverse of his relationship with Tsung-Dao Lee in the parity nonconservation work. He proposed the core idea and viewpoint, with Mills as the collaborator. Today, whenever Yang-Mills is mentioned within China, Mills is often described merely as Yang's assistant. By that standard, for the Nobel-winning work on parity nonconservation, Yang could also be considered Lee's assistant.</p>
</details>

这次的署名要求李并未同意，所以我们今天看到的论文依然是李前杨后。但到了诺奖颁奖现场，杨再次要求在李之前领奖。因为拿奖是个高兴的事，李也不好当场撕破脸皮，就只好同意了。于是就出现了我们现在看到的杨先出场领奖、先发言的情况。这也是为什么中国大陆一提到这次诺奖，总是说“杨振宁、李政道”的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lee did not agree to this authorship request, which is why the paper we see today still lists Lee first, then Yang. However, at the Nobel Prize award ceremony, Yang again demanded to receive the award before Lee. Since it was a joyous occasion, Lee found it difficult to openly confront him and reluctantly agreed. This led to the situation we now see, where Yang appeared first to receive the award and speak first. This is also why, whenever this Nobel Prize is mentioned in mainland China, it is always referred to as "Chen-Ning Yang, Tsung-Dao Lee."</p>
</details>

但直到此时，两人还没真正决裂。决裂的导火索发生在五年以后。一名记者写了一篇文章介绍杨、李二人解决宇称不守恒问题的过程，送给两人审稿的时候，李没有提出异议。但杨振宁则提出文章中有些“令人痛苦的地方”，要求文中提到诺贝尔奖及其他有两人署名的地方，应该将自己的名字放在前面；如果不得已要把李放在前面，一定要标注是出于字母顺序习惯。李政道知道这件事以后非常失望，主动找到杨振宁说以后不再合作了。杨也情绪激动，大哭起来，说很希望以后继续合作，但李还是拒绝了。随后，李政道向两人所在的普林斯顿高等研究院提出了辞呈。得知此事的**奥本海默**（J. Robert Oppenheimer: 美国理论物理学家，被誉为“原子弹之父”）说出了那句著名的：“李政道应该不要再做高能物理了，而杨振宁应该去看精神科医生。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the two had not truly broken up until this point. The catalyst for their split occurred five years later. A journalist wrote an article introducing the process by which Yang and Lee solved the parity nonconservation problem. When it was sent to both for review, Lee raised no objections. But Yang stated that there were "painful parts" in the article, demanding that wherever the Nobel Prize and other joint authorship mentions appeared, his name should be placed first; if Lee's name had to be placed first, it must be explicitly noted that it was due to alphabetical order convention. Tsung-Dao Lee was deeply disappointed upon learning this and proactively approached Chen-Ning Yang, stating he would no longer collaborate. Yang became emotional and cried, saying he very much hoped to continue their collaboration, but Lee still refused. Subsequently, Tsung-Dao Lee submitted his resignation to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where both worked. Upon hearing this, J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the "father of the atomic bomb," famously remarked, "Tsung-Dao Lee should no longer do high-energy physics, and Chen-Ning Yang should see a psychiatrist."</p>

### 为中共恶政站台：杨振宁1971年访华后的演讲

如果说以上这件事体现了杨振宁和他父亲一样的功利主义价值观的话，那以下这件事则可以用“一言难尽”来形容了。首先是1971年**尼克松**（Richard Nixon: 美国前总统，任内实现中美关系正常化）访华前夕，杨振宁结束了赴华访问，回到美国时在纽约大学史坦顿岛分校进行了多场题为《我对中华人民共和国的印象》的演讲，分享了他的见闻。开篇的部分，他满怀深情地说：“我发觉今天的中国是完全地改变了，和26年前我认识的中国已完全不同。最重要的一点，也是最值得中国人自豪的一点，就是精神。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If the above incident demonstrated Chen-Ning Yang's utilitarian values, similar to his father's, then the following event can only be described as "hard to articulate." Firstly, on the eve of Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1971, Chen-Ning Yang concluded his visit to China and, upon returning to the United States, delivered several speeches titled "My Impressions of the People's Republic of China" at the Staten Island campus of New York University, sharing his observations. In the opening, he spoke with deep emotion: "I found that China today has completely changed, entirely different from the China I knew 26 years ago. The most important point, and the most pride-worthy for Chinese people, is its spirit."</p>
</details>

接下来，他先是对正在进行的**文革**（Cultural Revolution: 1966-1976年间中国发生的政治运动，对社会造成巨大破坏）表达了高度正面的评价，称赞中国教育体系在文革期间的伟大成就，比如“教育和劳动生产相结合的原则”（这指的应该是**上山下乡**，Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside: 文革期间中国青年被强制下放到农村和边远地区接受再教育的运动），强调教育要为人民服务，要理论联系实际，还建议美国也应该学习中国的教育和招生制度。其次，他认为文革推动了对官僚主义和旧的行政体系的冲击，有助于社会精神的复兴和群众的参与，是值得肯定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, he first expressed highly positive evaluations of the ongoing Cultural Revolution, praising the great achievements of China's education system during that period. For example, he cited the "principle of combining education with productive labor" (which likely refers to the Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside movement), emphasizing that education should serve the people and integrate theory with practice, even suggesting that the United States should learn from China's education and enrollment systems. Secondly, he believed that the Cultural Revolution promoted an assault on bureaucracy and the old administrative system, contributing to the revival of social spirit and mass participation, which he deemed commendable.</p>
</details>

最离谱的是，他还公然为中共最为人诟病的几大恶政站台和背书。包括哪些呢？一个是曾经大规模推广的臭名昭著的**针灸麻醉**（Acupuncture Anesthesia: 一种通过针刺穴位来达到麻醉效果的医疗技术，曾在中国被过度宣传）。关于这一点，著名作家、“童话大王”的作者**郑渊洁**（Zheng Yuanjie: 中国著名童话作家）曾有幸体验并且记录了下来，有兴趣的朋友可以看看他的感受。而杨的说法是，他亲眼见到一个针灸麻醉的女病人在剖开她肚皮的时候神志清醒，并且感觉不到任何疼痛，还表示针刺麻醉的理论研究可能是个重大的课题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most outrageously, he openly endorsed and championed several of the CCP's most criticized policies. What were they? One was the infamous acupuncture anesthesia, which was widely promoted. On this point, the famous writer and "King of Fairy Tales," Zheng Yuanjie, had the opportunity to experience and record it; interested friends can look up his impressions. Yang's account was that he personally witnessed a female patient undergoing acupuncture anesthesia who was conscious when her abdomen was opened and felt no pain, and he suggested that theoretical research into acupuncture anesthesia could be a major topic.</p>
</details>

其次，他盛赞中共开始实行的**计划生育**（One-Child Policy: 中国曾实施的强制性人口控制政策，包括强制引产等手段），就是强制引产政策。他表示女护士们告诉他，他们可以给超过六个月的孕妇实施堕胎手术，安全率百分之百。杨对这种所谓高效的堕胎技术感到惊讶，说在医学的某些领域上，“今天的中国明显的是比其他的国家更进步的，其中之一便是堕胎的方法”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Secondly, he highly praised the CCP's implementation of the one-child policy, specifically the forced abortion policy. He stated that female nurses told him they could perform abortions on pregnant women over six months with a 100% safety rate. Yang expressed astonishment at this supposedly efficient abortion technique, saying that in certain areas of medicine, "China today is clearly more advanced than other countries, and one of them is the method of abortion."</p>
</details>

第三，他极力称赞中共当时宣传、后来被证明是造假的**农业学大寨**（Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture: 文革期间中国推广的农业运动，要求全国农村学习大寨大队，但其成就多有夸大和造假），称大寨的农作物产量远高于其他地区，这使中国彻底实现了粮食上的自给自足，并已经开始对外出口粮食。“无论是在农村还是城市，都不缺少米和面粉，蔬菜和水果又多又便宜，上海工人的伙食比我们美国的学生食堂还要好一些，大家都说全靠毛主席思想的正确领导。”这里稍微补充一点，杨提到中国粮食自给自足还对外出口，其实是为了回应外界的质疑，也就是在三年大饥荒期间，中共一边从加拿大、美国进口粮食或者接受粮食援助，一边还在对阿尔巴尼亚等国家无偿赠送粮食。这在西方，尤其是美国引发了很多批评声，而当时的中国是坚决否认发生饥荒的。杨的表态相当于为中共宣传做了背书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, he vigorously praised the "Learn from Dazhai in Agriculture" campaign, which the CCP promoted at the time and was later proven to be fraudulent. He claimed that Dazhai's crop yields were far higher than other regions, which enabled China to achieve complete self-sufficiency in grain and even begin exporting food. "Whether in the countryside or the city, there is no shortage of rice and flour, vegetables and fruits are abundant and cheap, and the meals of Shanghai workers are even better than our American student cafeterias. Everyone says it's all thanks to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao's thought." Here, I'll add a point: Yang's mention of China's food self-sufficiency and exports was actually a response to external skepticism. During the Great Famine, the CCP was simultaneously importing grain from Canada and the United States or accepting food aid, while also gratuitously donating grain to countries like Albania. This drew much criticism in the West, especially in the United States, and China at the time firmly denied any famine. Yang's statement essentially endorsed the CCP's propaganda.</p>
</details>

第四，他为毛泽东的**个人崇拜**（Cult of Personality: 对某个人物进行极端神化和盲目崇拜的现象）和**红宝书**（Little Red Book: 《毛主席语录》，文革期间被广泛传播和学习）包括残酷的集体主义迫害进行了辩护，称红宝书是中国民众自发的对于领袖的爱戴，而工人农民的牺牲则源于中国几千年来的文化传统。总之，民众都是自愿的、幸福的。纵览整篇演讲稿，它几乎回避了所有中共各种政治运动带来的灾难和反人类暴行。如果你不知道演讲者的身份，还以为这是中共外交部的通稿呢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fourth, he defended Mao Zedong's cult of personality and the Little Red Book, including the brutal collectivist persecutions. He claimed that the Little Red Book represented the spontaneous love of the Chinese people for their leader, and that the sacrifices of workers and peasants stemmed from China's millennia-old cultural traditions. In short, the populace was voluntary and happy. Looking through the entire speech, it almost completely avoided all the disasters and anti-human atrocities brought about by the CCP's various political campaigns. If you didn't know the speaker's identity, you might think it was a press release from the CCP's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
</details>

### 与毛泽东的会见：科学家的谄媚与良知的泯灭

第二件事，是1973年7月18日，杨振宁得到了毛泽东的接见，并和这位据说初中数学考过0分的中专生畅谈了对当代物理学的看法。《人民日报》刊登了全文。这场会见的对话内容我这里稍微念几句。落座以后，毛问杨：“物质是无限可分的，如果物质分到一个阶段变成不可分了，那么一万年以后科学家干什么呢？”接着，毛从中国古典哲学里为自己的辩证思想寻找依据，说：“古书里说‘一日之棰，日取其半，万世不竭’，这就是物质可分的意思吗？”随后，他又扯了些辩证法：“公孙龙说过‘白马非马’。马有白马、黑马、大马、小马，还有日本的高头大马、非洲的斑马，但是看不见那个马呀。又比如人有男人、女人，男人是人又不是人，或者女人是人也可以，可你是女人吗？所以又看不见人。”面对这种中学生水平的吹水，杨振宁是什么态度呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second event occurred on July 18, 1973, when Chen-Ning Yang was received by Mao Zedong. He had a lengthy discussion about contemporary physics with Mao, who reportedly scored zero in junior high school mathematics and was a vocational school graduate. The full transcript of this meeting was published in the "People's Daily." Let me read a few excerpts from their conversation. After they sat down, Mao asked Yang, "Matter is infinitely divisible. If matter is divided to a point where it becomes indivisible, what will scientists do ten thousand years from now?" Then, Mao sought philosophical backing for his dialectical thought from classical Chinese philosophy, saying, "Ancient texts say, 'A one-foot rod, half of it taken each day, will never be exhausted.' Does this mean matter is divisible?" Subsequently, he rambled on about dialectics: "Gongsun Long said, 'A white horse is not a horse.' There are white horses, black horses, large horses, small horses, and also tall Japanese horses, African zebras, but you can't see 'that horse.' Or take humans: there are men and women. A man is a human but not a human, or a woman can be a human, but are you a woman? So you can't see 'the human.'" Faced with such middle-school-level chatter, what was Chen-Ning Yang's attitude?</p>
</details>

杨以敬佩的口吻说道：“主席您看得很远，看到了社会的将来。您把科学实验与**阶级斗争**（Class Struggle: 马克思主义理论中指不同阶级之间为争夺利益而进行的斗争）、**生产斗争**（Struggle for Production: 中共提出的“三大革命运动”之一，指人类改造自然、发展生产力的活动）一起提，很重要。”过了一会儿，杨又表示：“我很喜欢毛主席的诗词，原来觉得中国的古诗好也很喜欢，但总觉得过于悲观了。主席的诗很好，特别是有很多的解释。我最喜欢的两句诗：‘未有牺牲多壮志，敢叫日月换新天。’我第一次回国访问后回到美国去演讲，有一千多人听，最后我说这两句诗最能代表新中国的精神了。”谈到自己的岳父**杜聿明**（Du Yuming: 国民党高级将领），杨又补充说：“他说国民党和共产党军队打仗一点希望都没有。他现在对于新中国有着坚强的信心，比我父亲强。”临行前，杨还表达了自己的敬意：“毛主席，我在中国到处看到大家祝愿您**万寿无疆**（Boundless Longevity: 祝愿长寿的最高敬语，文革期间常用于对毛泽东的个人崇拜）的标语，我也要祝毛主席万寿无疆。”通篇看下来，我在杨身上只看到两个字：谄媚。尤其是考虑到他的老师**饶毓泰**（Rao Yutai: 中国著名物理学家，曾受政治迫害）、**叶企孙**（Ye Qisun: 中国著名物理学家、教育家，曾受政治迫害）、**吴有训**（Wu Youxun: 中国著名物理学家、教育家，曾受政治迫害）、朋友**赵九章**（Zhao Jiuzhang: 中国著名气象学家，曾受政治迫害）、**姚桐斌**（Yao Tongbin: 中国著名材料科学家，在文革中被迫害致死）先后被迫害致死，好友邓稼先、钱三强、王淦昌都不同程度遭到残酷迫害的情况下，这样的态度实在令人不齿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yang spoke with an admiring tone: "Chairman, you see very far, you see the future of society. It is very important that you mention scientific experimentation alongside class struggle and the struggle for production." After a while, Yang further stated: "I really like Chairman Mao's poetry. I used to like classical Chinese poetry, but always found it too pessimistic. The Chairman's poetry is very good, especially with many interpretations. My two favorite lines of poetry are: 'Never before have such sacrifices been made, daring to make the sun and moon change the sky.' When I returned to the United States after my first visit to China to give a speech, over a thousand people listened, and I concluded by saying these two lines best represent the spirit of New China." Speaking of his father-in-law, Du Yuming, Yang added, "He said there was no hope for the Nationalist and Communist armies fighting. He now has strong confidence in New China, stronger than my father." Before leaving, Yang also expressed his respect: "Chairman Mao, everywhere I go in China, I see slogans wishing you boundless longevity. I also want to wish Chairman Mao boundless longevity." Reading through the entire account, I only see two words in Yang: flattery. This attitude is truly disgraceful, especially considering that his teachers Rao Yutai, Ye Qisun, Wu Youxun, and friends Zhao Jiuzhang, Yao Tongbin were successively persecuted to death, and his close friends Deng Jiaxian, Qian Sanqiang, and Wang Ganchang all suffered cruel persecution to varying degrees.</p>

### 鼓吹“中国模式”：杨振宁对中共专制体制的持续背书

1976年毛泽东死后，杨振宁又在纽约毛泽东追悼大会上发表了题为《人类历史上的一位巨人》的演讲。演讲的链接我会稍后放在评论区。可以很确定地说，这篇文章出自中共的宣传口，因为那种歌功颂德、张口闭口“毛主席”、熟练引用毛泽东诗词和文章的**党八股**（Party Jargon: 指中共官方文风，常套用固定模式和空洞词藻，缺乏真情实感）文风，只可能是常年写惯了党八股的御用文人才写得出来的，杨振宁就算有这个心也没这个能力。

<p class="english-text">After Mao Zedong's death in 1976, Chen-Ning Yang delivered a speech titled "A Giant in Human History" at a memorial service for Mao Zedong in New York. I will put the link to the speech in the comments section later. It can be stated with certainty that this article originated from the CCP's propaganda apparatus, because that style of eulogizing, constantly mentioning "Chairman Mao," and skillfully quoting Mao Zedong's poetry and writings—a style of Party jargon—could only be produced by official writers accustomed to it for years; Chen-Ning Yang, even if he had the intention, would not have had the ability.</p>

杨为人诟病的第三件事，是他2011年回国以后接受《南都专访》这篇文章。标题很直白，就叫《杨振宁称中国模式胜于西方》。总结一下，在这段采访中他表达了几个观点。第一，民主和科学的发展没有关系，中国能有现在的局面，最重要的贡献是因为有中国共产党。这里他说了这么句话：“在专制的体制下能不能有科研的发展？我说苏联当时是很专制，可他的科技发展有些方向是非常成功的。那个记者又问我一党执政是不是对科技发展不利？到这个程度我就知道他是《苹果日报》的了。中国要是现在放弃一党执政的话，我认为对科技发展不利。”

<p class="english-text">The third thing Chen-Ning Yang is criticized for is his interview with "Southern Metropolis Daily" after returning to China in 2011. The article's title was straightforward: "Chen-Ning Yang Claims China Model Superior to West." To summarize, he expressed several viewpoints in this interview. First, he argued that there is no relationship between democracy and scientific development, and that the most important contribution to China's current situation is the Chinese Communist Party. Here, he said: "Can scientific research develop under an authoritarian system? I said the Soviet Union was very authoritarian at the time, but its technological development was very successful in some areas. The reporter then asked me if one-party rule was detrimental to scientific development? At that point, I knew he was from 'Apple Daily.' If China were to abandon one-party rule now, I believe it would be detrimental to scientific development."</p>

除此以外，他还说：“21世纪后半年中国会变成世界第一大强国。20世纪最重要的、对人类历史有最长远影响的是有两件：一是人类利用科技大大增加生产力，二是中华民族站起来了。”这个语气基本上已经和王毅、华春莹之流没什么区别了。除此以外，杨在上世纪90年代的一些场合也曾经被迫承认过大跃进、文革和六四屠杀的存在，但这些悲剧，包括几千万人的死亡，在他嘴里都变成了民族崛起道路上的一些必然代价，和他爸的观点是一样一样的。可以预见的是，如果杨早年间回国，他在历次运动中的表现应该和钱学森无异，论证“**无产万金**”（Proletarian Gold: 讽刺性说法，指在极权体制下，即使没有物质财富也能获得精神或政治上的“财富”）的怕是又要多一位。

<p class="english-text">Furthermore, he stated: "In the latter half of the 21st century, China will become the world's foremost superpower. The two most important events of the 20th century, with the longest-lasting impact on human history, are: first, humanity's use of technology to greatly increase productivity, and second, the rise of the Chinese nation." This tone is essentially indistinguishable from that of Wang Yi or Hua Chunying. Additionally, in some instances in the 1990s, Yang was forced to acknowledge the existence of the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and the June Fourth Massacre. However, these tragedies, including the deaths of tens of millions, were transformed in his words into inevitable costs on the path to national rejuvenation, exactly mirroring his father's views. It is foreseeable that if Yang had returned to China earlier, his performance in various political campaigns would likely have been no different from Qian Xuesen's, adding another figure to those who argued for "proletarian gold."</p>

之前为杨振宁辩护的声音中，有一种说法是科学家很多都是政治冷感甚至政治白痴的，所以不要过分苛责。但我想说，这个观点起码并不适用于杨振宁，因为他一点也不冷感，更不白痴，他就是这个价值观。有人肯定要说了，就算这样，他也只是嘴炮，并没有真的做什么坏事。OK，接下来咱们就看看他具体都做了些什么。

<p class="english-text">Among the voices defending Chen-Ning Yang, there's an argument that many scientists are politically apathetic or even politically naive, so they shouldn't be overly criticized. But I want to say that this view, at least, does not apply to Chen-Ning Yang, because he was not apathetic at all, nor was he naive; he simply held these values. Someone might argue that even so, he was just talking, not actually doing anything bad. OK, next, let's look at what he specifically did.</p>

### 推动军事科技发展：杨振宁对中共军事实力的贡献

1986年，杨振宁推动在南开大学陈省身数学研究所里建立起了理论物理研究室。1997年，他又推动创办了清华大学高等研究中心，任名誉主任。按**施一公**（Shi Yigong: 中国结构生物学家，曾任清华大学副校长）的说法，他是清华的“定海神针”，帮清华引进了一大批原本不可能回来的大师，其中包括图灵奖获得者**姚期智**（Andrew Yao: 华裔美国计算机科学家，图灵奖得主）和密码学家**王小云**（Wang Xiaoyun: 中国著名密码学家，曾破解多项国际加密算法）。姚期智的加入将清华在理论计算机科学、量子计算等领域提升到了国际顶尖水平。而王小云则破解了广泛应用于美国政府、金融、国防等高敏感系统的核心加密算法。按官方的说法，他俩的研究成果直接保障了国防安全，是确保中国在未来信息战中保持优势、保护军事机密通信的关键。

<p class="english-text">In 1986, Chen-Ning Yang promoted the establishment of a theoretical physics research laboratory at the Chern Institute of Mathematics, Nankai University. In 1997, he further spearheaded the founding of the Institute for Advanced Study at Tsinghua University, serving as its honorary director. According to Shi Yigong, he was Tsinghua's "stabilizing force," helping the university attract a large number of masters who would otherwise have been impossible to bring back, including Turing Award laureate Andrew Yao and cryptographer Wang Xiaoyun. Yao's addition elevated Tsinghua to a top international level in fields such as theoretical computer science and quantum computing. Wang Xiaoyun, on the other hand, cracked core encryption algorithms widely used in highly sensitive systems of the U.S. government, finance, and defense. According to official statements, their research directly ensured national defense security and was key to ensuring China's advantage in future information warfare and protecting military confidential communications.</p>

除此以外，杨还在1997年到2005年之间多次上书中央，力主中国应该尽快发展**自由电子激光技术**（Free-Electron Laser Technology: 一种利用高速电子束产生高能激光的技术，在军事领域有广泛应用）。该技术可直接应用于高能激光武器、精确制导、新型雷达以及新型军用材料的研发和制造。杨的力推为中国占据这一军事技术制高点提供了先机。此外，杨参与决策的**正负电子对撞机**（Electron-Positron Collider: 一种高能物理实验装置，用于研究基本粒子），带动了中国高技术设备和精密仪器的研发和制造，大大增强了中共在军事雷达、电子对抗和技术方面的能力。

<p class="english-text">Furthermore, between 1997 and 2005, Yang repeatedly wrote to the central government, strongly advocating that China should rapidly develop Free-Electron Laser Technology. This technology can be directly applied to the research and manufacturing of high-energy laser weapons, precision guidance, new types of radar, and novel military materials. Yang's strong advocacy provided China with an early advantage in securing this military technological high ground. Additionally, the Electron-Positron Collider, in whose decision-making Yang participated, spurred the research and development and manufacturing of high-tech equipment and precision instruments in China, significantly enhancing the CCP's capabilities in military radar, electronic countermeasures, and technology.</p>

以上这些，如果你站在民族主义、宏大叙事的角度，可能会拍手叫好。但如果换位思考一下呢，它在做什么？在帮助一个直接威胁全世界、奴役本国民众的史上最邪恶的独裁政权备战。这和二战期间帮助希特勒助纣为虐研发核武器的**海森堡**（Werner Heisenberg: 德国物理学家，诺贝尔物理学奖得主，曾参与纳粹德国核武器项目）和**维斯特克**（Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker: 德国物理学家、哲学家，曾参与纳粹德国核武器项目）有什么区别？如果你认为杨振宁做得对，请记住，在纳粹分子眼里，海森堡们也是英雄，而**爱因斯坦**（Albert Einstein: 著名物理学家，相对论的提出者，曾呼吁警惕纳粹）才是那个背叛了国家的叛徒。

<p class="english-text">All of the above, if viewed from a nationalist, grand narrative perspective, might be applauded. But if you consider it from another angle, what was it doing? It was helping the most evil authoritarian regime in history, one that directly threatens the world and enslaves its own people, prepare for war. How is this different from Werner Heisenberg and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, who aided Hitler's atrocities by developing nuclear weapons during World War II? If you believe Chen-Ning Yang did the right thing, remember that in the eyes of Nazis, Heisenbergs were heroes, while Albert Einstein was the traitor who betrayed his country.</p>

### 结语：对“为国家做贡献”的再思考

节目的最后，我想对那些认为“虽然中共有问题，但杨毕竟是在为国家和人民做贡献，帮助中国科技进步，培养了大批顶尖人才，这对我们也是有好处的”人说几句话。第一，当自由极度匮乏时，民族主义就会成为情感与意义的廉价替代品，而对政权的忠诚将被伪装成对人民的热爱。第二，当国家不正义时，爱国就会成为一切反人类行为的遮羞布。第三，如果一座机器被设计的目的就是用来屠杀，那更多的人才、更高的效率、更坚固耐用并不会增加福祉，而是一场对于所有人的灾难，甚至包括这台机器的操作人员。

<p class="english-text">Finally, I want to say a few words to those who believe that "although the CCP has problems, Yang, after all, contributed to the nation and its people, helped advance China's science and technology, and cultivated a large number of top talents, which is also beneficial to us." First, when freedom is severely lacking, nationalism becomes a cheap substitute for emotion and meaning, and loyalty to the regime is disguised as love for the people. Second, when a nation is unjust, patriotism becomes a cover for all anti-human acts. Third, if a machine is designed for the purpose of slaughter, then more talent, higher efficiency, and greater durability will not increase well-being, but rather lead to a disaster for everyone, including the operators of that machine.</p>
