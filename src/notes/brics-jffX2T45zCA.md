### 拉美盟友与地缘政治机遇

Eight or nine, 10 countries, Argentina foremost among them, that have aligned with the United States on issue after issue in international community events all over the world.

八九个，甚至十个国家，其中阿根廷首当其冲，在全世界的国际社会活动中，在各种问题上都与美国保持一致。

In fact, these great allies like Argentina.

事实上，这些伟大的盟友，比如阿根廷。

But I can go into out of Costa Rica, I don't want to leave anybody out of El Salvador.

但我可以说，还有哥斯达黎加，我不想遗漏萨尔瓦多。

But I think one of the more promising developments is later this month, there will be an election in Bolivia after 25, 30 years of anti-American hostile government.

但我认为一个更有希望的进展是，本月晚些时候玻利维亚将举行选举，此前玻利维亚经历了25、30年的反美敌对政府。

Both of the candidates running in that election, in the runoff election, want strong and better relations with the United States.

参加那场选举——也就是决选——的两位候选人都希望与美国建立强大而更好的关系。

So another transformative opportunity there.

所以那里又有一个变革性的机会。

This is important. This is our hemisphere.

我认为这很重要。这是我们的半球。

It's where we live, and having strong neighbors such as, and great progress has been made and will make more over the last nine months, really over the last nine months.

这是我们居住的地方，拥有强大的邻国，并且在过去九个月里，确实在过去九个月里，取得了巨大进展，并将取得更多进展。

I believe the president's for much I want to say this.

我相信总统在很多方面，我想说的是。

### 阿根廷贸易与美国援助条件

Do you imagine soon a free trade agreement with Argentina? Could it be possible soon?

您是否设想很快能与阿根廷达成自由贸易协定？这有可能很快实现吗？

Yeah, it will be.

是的，会的。

We're going to discuss some of it today, but we want to help Argentina.

我们今天将讨论其中一些，但我们想帮助阿根廷。

And we want to always help ourselves, but we want to help Argentina.

我们总是想帮助自己，但我们也想帮助阿根廷。

And one of the ways we can do it, they have great product and we used to do a lot of trade.

我们能做的一件事是，他们有很棒的产品，我们以前也做过很多贸易。

And then if you look at what the Democrats, well, they didn't know, honestly, they didn't know what they were doing.

然后，如果你看看民主党人做了什么，他们不知道，说实话，他们不知道自己在做什么。

But a lot of that trade disappeared and they have great product.

但很多贸易都消失了，而他们有很棒的产品。

So we will be trading with Argentina that will be helpful to them.

所以我们将与阿根廷进行贸易，这对他们会有帮助。

And so for me, it's good for us also.

对我来说，这对我们也有好处。

Also, this president was trying to draw a wedge between the U.S. and Argentina by buying soybeans from Argentina, not U.S. farmers, and China on the Falklands.

此外，这位总统试图通过从阿根廷而非美国农民那里购买大豆，以及在马尔维纳斯群岛问题上与中国合作，来离间美国和阿根廷。

China likes to draw ships too. Yeah, sure.

中国也喜欢派遣船只。是的，当然。

I mean, I guess that's natural.

我的意思是，我想那是自然的。

It's China and it's natural, but it's not going to stop, it's not going to mean anything in the end.

这是中国，这是自然的，但这不会停止，最终也不会有任何意义。

Mr. President, we're going to continue should not continue in the China. Sure. And close the space race in Ukraine. I don't think you should be doing business much. You can do some trade, but you certainly shouldn't be doing beyond that, certainly shouldn't be doing anything having to do with the military with China. And if that's what's happening, I'd be very upset about that. Yeah, I'm really sure that's got me surprised. You do understand What about this one? Because it's so important for African countries to go ahead and provide the the American assistance is not predicated on this swap with China being closed. Any reporting to that effect is incorrect.

总统先生，我们应该继续还是不继续在中国的问题上？当然。并结束在乌克兰的太空竞赛。我不认为您应该与中国有太多商业往来。您可以进行一些贸易，但肯定不应该超越这个范围，肯定不应该与中国进行任何与军事相关的事情。如果那样的事情正在发生，我会非常不高兴。是的，我真的对此感到惊讶。您理解吗？那这个呢？因为对于非洲国家来说，继续提供美国援助非常重要，而这并非以与中国的这种交易被叫停为前提。任何关于此的报道都是不正确的。

Mr. You said sorry, but you've said that at a convenient cost to export to China for your business on the agenda and this stuff is so important.

先生，您抱歉，但您曾说过，为了您的业务议程，以方便的成本向中国出口，这些事情非常重要。

I was referring more to ports, military bases, observation facilities that have been created in Argentina down the track.

我更多指的是阿根廷未来可能建立的港口、军事基地、观测设施。

More about this one, much more than this one.

更多是关于这个，比这个多得多。

Mr. Because he was referring to that. Yeah. Behind you, please. Yes, quite impressive for Argentina. What's the benefits for United States in helping this way?

先生，因为他指的是那个。是的。请您后面。是的，这对阿根廷来说相当令人印象深刻。美国以这种方式帮助阿根廷有什么好处？

Argentina, just helping a great philosophy take over a great country.

阿根廷，只是帮助一种伟大的哲学在一个伟大的国家中占据主导。

Argentina is one of the most beautiful countries that I've ever seen, and we want to see it succeed.

阿根廷是我见过最美丽的国家之一，我们希望看到它成功。

Very simple. I mean, we don't have to do it.

非常简单。我的意思是，我们不必这样做。

It's not going to make a big difference for our country, but it will in terms of South America, if Argentina does well, you're going to have others following and a lot of others are following.

这对我们国家不会产生太大的影响，但就南美洲而言，如果阿根廷发展得好，其他国家就会效仿，而且很多其他国家正在效仿。

You have countries in South America that two years ago would have never even been thought of to go as democracies or as just countries that want to do fair and balanced trading.

两年前，南美洲有些国家甚至从未被认为是民主国家，或者只是想进行公平和平衡贸易的国家。

And now all, I mean, you mention Bolivia, but you there are numerous other countries that are coming our way.

而现在所有，我的意思是，你提到了玻利维亚，但还有许多其他国家正在走向我们。

And Brazil, as you know, I had a very good conversation with the president.

至于巴西，如你所知，我与总统进行了一次非常愉快的谈话。

I met him at the United Nations before I went up to speak.

我在联合国发言前见了他。

And then I found that he didn't have a speech because they had no teleprompter.

然后我发现他没有演讲稿，因为他们没有提词器。

They turned off my teleprompter purposely.

他们故意关掉了我的提词器。

It made it impossible for him, but it didn't silence me.

这让他无法演讲，但这没有让我沉默。

I spoke with that and it was a good speech.

我用那个演讲了，那是一场很好的演讲。

But no, I don't think of that.

但是不，我没有想到那个。

You go to the United Nations.

你去了联合国。

I'm speaking in front of 158 leaders and the whole world.

我在158位领导人和全世界面前发言。

And I look at my teleprompter and it's dead.

我看着我的提词器，它死了。

They killed my teleprompter.

他们弄坏了我的提词器。

They wouldn't let the man that operated into the booth.

他们不让操作员进入播音室。

Can you believe by having a specific interest in economic terms, I do have no, I want to see it succeed.

你相信吗，从经济角度来看，我确实没有，我希望它成功。

I think it's going to be great and we will benefit also.

我认为这会很棒，我们也会受益。

But it's not that big a benefit because it's not that big a country, but it's a very important country and it's a country that can be very successful.

但这并不是一个很大的好处，因为它不是一个很大的国家，但它是一个非常重要的国家，而且是一个可以非常成功的国家。

There are some countries that will never be successful.

有些国家永远不会成功。

This is a country that has great potential.

这是一个潜力巨大的国家。

If it has the right leadership and you have the right leadership with this man right here.

如果它拥有正确的领导，而你们正拥有这位先生这样的正确领导。

### 货币政策与BRICS挑战

Okay, Mr. President, what do you support, **Dollarization** (Dollarization: 一个国家放弃本国货币，转而使用美元作为主要货币的经济政策)?

好的，总统先生，您支持**美元化**（Dollarization: 一个国家放弃本国货币，转而使用美元作为主要货币的经济政策）吗？

I would say that I'll leave that up to my economic people.

我会说，我把这个问题留给我的经济团队。

But I like the dollar.

但我喜欢美元。

I'm very strong on the dollar.

我非常看好美元。

And anybody who wants to deal in dollars, they have an advantage over people that aren't.

任何想用美元交易的人，都比不用美元的人有优势。

But for the most part, we're keeping it that way.

但总的来说，我们保持这种方式。

I think if Biden, that group would have gotten elected, meaning Kamala, you wouldn't have the dollar as your currency anymore.

我想如果拜登，那个团体当选了，也就是卡玛拉，你们就不会再把美元作为货币了。

You wouldn't have world domination by the dollar if Biden didn't win this election.

如果拜登没有赢得这次选举，美元就不会在世界上占据主导地位。

And now the domination like **BRICS** (BRICS: 由巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非组成的经济合作组织).

现在这种主导地位就像**金砖国家**（BRICS: 由巴西、俄罗斯、印度、中国和南非组成的经济合作组织）。

I don't anybody wants to be in BRICS, that's fine.

我不知道是否有人想加入金砖国家，那没关系。

But we're going to put tariffs on you nation.

但我们会对你们国家征收关税。

Everybody dropped out.

所有人都退出了。

They're all dropping out of BRICS.

他们都在退出金砖国家。

BRICS was an attack on the dollar.

金砖国家是对美元的攻击。

And I said, "You want to play that game? I'm going to put tariffs on your on your all of your product coming into the U.S."

我说：“你们想玩那个游戏吗？我将对你们所有进入美国的产品征收关税。”

They said, like I said, "We're dropping out of BRICS."

他们说，就像我说的，“我们正在退出金砖国家。”

And BRICS is like, they don't even talk about it.

金砖国家就像，他们甚至都不谈论它了。

Scott: You want to add to that? But we're very happy with the current currency arrangement.

斯科特：你想补充吗？但我们对当前的货币安排非常满意。

### 媒体批评与政治立场

Mr. President. Chief Minister John Ryan. First of all, congratulations. Questions from ABC Fake News after what you did with STEPHANOPOULOS to the vice president of the United States. I don't take questions from ABC Fake news.

总统先生。首席部长约翰·瑞安。首先，恭喜您。在您与史蒂芬诺普洛斯对美国副总统所做的事情之后，来自ABC假新闻的问题。我不接受ABC假新闻的问题。

Brian, go ahead. Yes, sir. First of all, congratulations on achieving peace. You are indeed the peacemaker. On a lighter note, I think I was going to be called the peacemaker. Actually, I did. I saw some of the actions here. Just go ahead. But on a lighter note, Alyssa Farah, she is one of the hosts on ABC's show The View. She said a while back, I'll quote, "If Trump gets the Israeli hostages out, I promise I will wear a **MAGA hat** (MAGA hat: “让美国再次伟大”口号的帽子，特朗普竞选标志) for one day on this show and say thank you for doing it." Your response?

布莱恩，请讲。是的，先生。首先，恭喜您实现和平。您确实是和平缔造者。轻松点说，我以为我会被称为和平缔造者。实际上，我看到了这里的一些行动。请继续。但轻松点说，艾丽莎·法拉，她是ABC节目《The View》的主持人之一。她前段时间说过，我引用一下，“如果特朗普能让以色列人质获释，我保证有一天会在这个节目中戴上**MAGA帽子**（MAGA hat: “让美国再次伟大”口号的帽子，特朗普竞选标志），并说谢谢您做到了。”您的回应是？

Well, did she put the hat on?

那么，她戴帽子了吗？

Well, she hasn't got the hat yet. Who is it? Which one? Elizabeth Warren.

她还没戴帽子呢。是谁？哪一个？伊丽莎白·沃伦。

Well, she used to work for me, so she used to work here.

嗯，她以前为我工作，所以她以前在这里工作。

I'll tell you about Alyssa.

我来告诉你关于艾丽莎的事。

She worked here.

她在这里工作过。

She gave me the most beautiful letter when, you know, the administration.

她在我的政府任职期间，给了我一封最漂亮的信。

The time came up. The election was rigged.

时机到了。选举被操纵了。

I left. She gave me the most beautiful letter you've ever seen.

我离开了。她给了我你见过最漂亮的信。

I was a great president.

我是一位伟大的总统。

What a great job.

多么棒的工作。

Some of the letters have been quoted.

其中一些信件曾被引用。

This is Alyssa, who I never thought was very outstanding.

这就是艾丽莎，我从来不觉得她很出色。

I figured she would not make it.

我原以为她不会成功。

And she did have a big role here.

她在这里确实扮演了重要角色。

And then we had January 6, and she left.

然后我们经历了1月6日，她就离开了。

And she left after that or before that.

她是在那之后还是之前离开的。

But she gave me the most beautiful letters.

但她给了我最美丽的信件。

And then even months after she left, and while we weren't here in L.A., she sent another glowing letter, beautiful letter.

然后甚至在她离开几个月后，当我们不在洛杉矶时，她又寄来了一封热情洋溢、美丽的信。

And then she got hired by The View, and they gave her a couple of bucks and she changed her view very quickly.

然后她被《The View》雇佣了，他们给了她一些钱，她很快就改变了她的观点。

I never thought she'd make it.

我从没想过她会成功。

Never thought she had what it took in any way.

从没想过她有任何方面的能力。

You know what that means.

你知道那意味着什么。

But she's on The View.

但她在《The View》节目中。

But it just shows what a fraud The View is, because this woman gave me letters and statements.

但这正好表明《The View》是多么的虚伪，因为这个女人曾给我写信和声明。

She said I was the greatest president in her lifetime.

她说我是她一生中最伟大的总统。

Now, she's not that.

现在，她不是那样了。

Also, I didn't consider it a great compliment, but I've had better.

此外，我不认为这是一个很大的赞美，但我曾得到过更好的。

Can we send her had more recently I've had the greatest president of them all I like that much about her is the president. Is that include Washington and Lincoln? Yes, sir. As I said, I like that phrase. So I think she's a total I think she's a godsend for this president. I'm driving.

我们能给她送去吗？最近我曾被称赞为“有史以来最伟大的总统”，我喜欢她对总统的这种评价。这包括华盛顿和林肯吗？是的，先生。正如我所说，我喜欢那个说法。所以我认为她是一个彻底的，我认为她对这位总统来说是天赐之物。我正在开车。

### 哈马斯解除武装与国内治安

How long will it take **Hamas** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织) to disarm? And can you guarantee that is going to happen?

**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织）需要多长时间才能解除武装？您能保证这会发生吗？

They're going to disarm.

他们会解除武装。

And because they said they were going to disarm, and if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.

因为他们说他们会解除武装，如果他们不解除武装，我们将解除他们的武装。

How will you do that?

您将如何做到这一点？

I don't have to explain that to you.

我不需要向你解释。

But if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.

但如果他们不解除武装，我们将解除他们的武装。

They know I'm not playing games.

他们知道我不是在玩游戏。

Okay? Now we did something monumental.

好吗？现在我们做了一件具有里程碑意义的事情。

We got the hostages back.

我们把人质救回来了。

That was the first thing we had to do.

那是我们首先必须做的。

Above all else, get the hostages back.

最重要的是，把人质救回来。

Now, they misrepresented it because we were told they had 26, 24 of dead hostages, if we can use those terms.

现在，他们歪曲了事实，因为如果我们能用这些词的话，我们被告知他们有26、24名人质死亡。

And it seems as though they don't have that because we're talking about a much lesser number.

而且似乎他们没有那么多，因为我们谈论的是一个少得多的数字。

But that's a very tough subject.

但那是一个非常棘手的话题。

I want them back. That's what they said.

我希望他们回来。他们就是这么说的。

I want them back.

我希望他们回来。

Also, they said they were going to disarm and initially speaking, they needed, they did take out a couple of gangs that were very bad, very, very bad gangs.

此外，他们说他们会解除武装，最初来说，他们确实清除了几个非常非常糟糕的帮派。

And they did take them out and they killed a number of gang members.

他们确实清除了这些帮派，并杀死了许多帮派成员。

And that didn't bother me much, to be honest with you.

老实说，那并没有太困扰我。

That's okay.

那没关系。

And so a couple of very bad gangs, it's no different than other countries like Venezuela sent their gangs into us and we took care of those gangs.

所以几个非常糟糕的帮派，这与其他国家，比如委内瑞拉把他们的帮派送进我们国家，而我们处理了这些帮派，没有什么不同。

We have Washington, D.C. is one of the safest cities in the country.

我们有华盛顿特区，它是全国最安全的城市之一。

It was one of the worst cities in the country.

它曾是全国最糟糕的城市之一。

If you go back just a little while ago, right now, it's safe.

如果你回到不久前，现在，它是安全的。

You can walk to work. Isn't it nice?

你可以步行上班。这不好吗？

But we have told them we want to disarm and they will disarm.

但我们告诉他们我们希望解除武装，他们会解除武装的。

And if they don't disarm, we will disarm them.

如果他们不解除武装，我们将解除他们的武装。

And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently.

这会很快发生，也许会很暴力。

But they will disarm. Do you understand me?

但他们会解除武装。你明白我的意思吗？

Yes. You see, because you always everyone says, "Oh, well, they won't do so."

是的。你看，因为你们总是，每个人都说：“哦，他们不会这么做的。”

They will disarm.

他们会解除武装的。

And I spoke to Hamas and I said, "You're going to disarm, right?"

我与哈马斯谈过，我说：“你们会解除武装，对吧？”

"Yes, we're going to disarm."

“是的，我们会解除武装。”

That's what they told me.

他们就是这么告诉我的。

They will disarm or we will disarm them.

他们会解除武装，否则我们将解除他们的武装。

Got it. Okay.

明白了。好的。

What I heard you say quickly, sir, Also, you said quickly, But what is the deadline you're going to put on a reasonable period of time pretty, pretty quickly. A reasonable period of time. Congratulations on the peace you achieved in the Middle East crisis. And my question is regarding Argentina. Are you from? I'm from Argentina. Yes, I like the Argentina. I like a much better the ABC today than ABC fake me two years ago. U.S. support for Argentina depend on the results of the upcoming legislative elections and the ability of the government to pass long lasting reforms through Congress.

先生，我听您说很快，您也说过很快，但您打算在多久之内设定一个合理的期限，相当快。一个合理的期限。恭喜您在中东危机中取得的和平。我的问题是关于阿根廷的。您来自哪里？我来自阿根廷。是的，我喜欢阿根廷。我喜欢今天的ABC比两年前的ABC假新闻好得多。美国对阿根廷的支持是否取决于即将到来的立法选举结果以及政府通过国会长期改革的能力？

Well, I think if they don't do that, we're not going to be around very long.

嗯，我想如果他们不那样做，我们也不会持续太久。

Scott: Can you handle that one, please? We're confident that the president's party will and the coalition will do well in the election. And this aid is predicated on robust policies. And going back to the failed **Peronist policies** (Peronist policies: 阿根廷的一种政治哲学，结合了民族主义、劳工主义和社会正义，常与政府干预经济相关) would cause a U.S. rethink. Same there. It's a little bit it's a great question. It's a little like New York.

斯科特：您能处理一下这个问题吗？我们相信总统的政党和联盟会在选举中表现出色。这项援助是以强有力的政策为前提的。如果回到失败的**庇隆主义政策**（Peronist policies: 阿根廷的一种政治哲学，结合了民族主义、劳工主义和社会正义，常与政府干预经济相关），将会导致美国重新考虑。那里也一样。这是一个很好的问题。这有点像纽约。

### 地方治理与资金支持

You know, we are reading in Argentina about New York.

你知道，我们在阿根廷读到关于纽约的报道。

We have a problem.

我们有一个问题。

We have a communist who's 33 years old, doesn't know a damn thing, practically.

我们有一个33岁的共产主义者，他几乎什么都不懂。

He's never worked a day in his life.

他一生中从未工作过一天。

And he sort of caught on. Right.

他有点明白了。对吧。

And I'm not going to send a lot of money to New York.

我不会给纽约寄很多钱。

I don't have to.

我没必要。

You know, the money comes all through the White House.

你知道，所有资金都通过白宫。

And if they're going to be sending us stupid policies, I mean, communist policies, which has proven for thousands of years, doesn't work.

如果他们要给我们推行愚蠢的政策，我的意思是，共产主义政策，这已经被证明了几千年，是行不通的。

We I have to prove it again.

我们我必须再次证明这一点。

We're not going to ruin one of our great cities because it will make that great.

我们不会毁掉我们的一座伟大城市，因为它将使它变得伟大。

We will clean up the crime in about 30 days.

我们将在大约30天内清除犯罪。

Took 12 days to do Washington, D.C. So New York is bigger.

华盛顿特区用了12天。所以纽约更大。

And Chicago, we've already made a lot of progress despite fighting from the government.

而芝加哥，尽管政府阻挠，我们已经取得了很大进展。

But, well, Chicago is doing great.

但是，芝加哥做得很好。

Memphis is doing really great.

孟菲斯做得真的很好。

You know, we have great support there from the political leaders.

你知道，我们在那里得到了政治领导人的大力支持。

They said, "Please come in and clean up crime," and we love it.

他们说：“请进来清理犯罪”，我们很喜欢。

We've in one week.

我们在一周内。

Memphis is so good.

孟菲斯太好了。

It's so much better.

好多了。

We'll have it within a month.

我们会在一个月内完成。

We'll have that into a safe city again.

我们将再次把它变成一个安全的城市。

And all of these cities, we want to clean them up.

所有这些城市，我们都想清理干净。

We don't like that opposition.

我们不喜欢那种反对。

But if somebody is going to be a communist mayor of New York, it's a fluke because he gets in.

但如果有人成为纽约的共产主义市长，那纯属侥幸，因为他上任了。

There are a lot of failed of people that he's running against.

他所竞选的对手中有很多失败者。

I mean, we have failed.

我的意思是，我们失败了。

You have inferior candidates or something because it's impossible to think that New York City can have a communist mayor.

你有一些劣质的候选人什么的，因为纽约市不可能有一个共产主义市长。

He's a communist.

他是一个共产主义者。

He's not a socialist, by the way.

顺便说一句，他不是社会主义者。

There's a big difference.

有很大的区别。

He's a communist. He's down and dirty.

他是一个共产主义者。他卑鄙下流。

He's a communist. He hates police.

他是一个共产主义者。他憎恨警察。

He wants to get rid of all police.

他想废除所有警察。

I mean, how can a policeman he hates Jewish people and yet he's got Jewish people support.

我的意思是，一个警察怎么能他憎恨犹太人，但他却得到了犹太人的支持。

He hates Jewish people.

他憎恨犹太人。

So it comes through the White House, the funding for New York and for everyplace comes through the White House.

所以，对纽约和各地的一切拨款都通过白宫。

And I'm very generous and I was always very generous with New York, even when you had opposition there.

我非常慷慨，对纽约也总是非常慷慨，即使当时你们有反对派。

But I was always very generous.

但我总是非常慷慨。

But I wouldn't be generous to a communist, a guy that's going to take the money and throw it out the window because you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars and we're not going to let somebody get into office and squander the taxpayer money from this country.

但我不会对一个共产主义者慷慨，一个会把钱拿走然后扔掉的人，因为你谈论的是数千亿美元，我们不会让某人上任并挥霍这个国家的纳税人的钱。

We're not going to let it happen.

我们不会让这种事发生。

So it's a little bit like that with if you take a look Argentina, if the president doesn't win, I know the person that he'd be running against, I believe probably we probably have the person a person is extremely far left and a philosophy that got Argentina into this problem in the first place.

所以，看看阿根廷，如果总统没有赢得选举，我认识他将要对抗的人，我相信我们可能会遇到一个极左翼的人，而正是这种哲学在一开始就让阿根廷陷入了困境。

So we would not be generous with Argentina if that happened.

所以如果发生那种情况，我们不会对阿根廷慷慨。

If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.

如果他输了，我们将不会对阿根廷慷慨。

### 委内瑞拉问题与“自动签名机”调查

Mr. President. Can you talk about Argentina, an important in the Latin America. What is your plan for Venezuelans? But is there you the terrorism, the narco terrorism in the president? Maduro, what is your plan?

总统先生。您能谈谈阿根廷吗，它在拉丁美洲很重要。您对委内瑞拉人有什么计划？但是总统马杜罗那里有恐怖主义、毒品恐怖主义吗？您的计划是什么？

Well, Venezuela's done a couple of things very badly.

嗯，委内瑞拉有几件事做得非常糟糕。

Number one, we get drugs and all of that, but we get something in a way worse because they're a big purveyor of drugs.

第一，我们收到毒品以及所有这些，但我们收到的某种东西更糟糕，因为他们是毒品的主要供应者。

But we have worse.

但我们有更糟糕的。

What they do very well is they send their criminals into the United States and they send trendy arugula that you know very well you're from Venezuela and they send them in by the thousands, literally.

他们做得非常好的一点是，他们把罪犯送到美国，他们把那些你很熟悉的，来自委内瑞拉的时髦芝麻菜（此处可能为口误，应指“他们”）成千上万地送进来，简直是。

And these are the worst of all.

而这些是所有中最糟糕的。

And they empty their prisons into the United States.

他们把监狱里的人都送到美国。

They empty their mental institutions into the United States.

他们把精神病院里的人都送到美国。

And because we had a president whose low IQ, he didn't realize what was going on.

因为我们有一位智商低的总统，他没有意识到发生了什么。

And the people that are high IQ that surround him, but they happen to be lunatics, radical left.

而那些围绕在他身边的智商高的人，他们碰巧是疯子，激进左翼。

They're highly intelligent, radical left lunatics.

他们是高度智能的激进左翼疯子。

Okay. So in a way that's worse than having a guy like Biden.

好的。所以从某种程度上说，这比有一个像拜登那样的人更糟糕。

But they ran the show.

但他们主导了局面。

### 政治原则与中国关系

What's your advice? Just to check something you said Hamas assured you that they would disarm. Was that a direct conversation or through like Mr. Whitcomb? Through through my be okay at the highest level, Once you you're out, you might find it was a very bad precedent for pursuing me. Later in Argentina, I said political leaders advice is to hold strong to his principles because he's right and he's proving that he was right. He's got one problem. He's got people that are giving him tremendously bad press, even though they know it's wrong. He's got to hold true to his principles because he's going to win. He's going to win. He's doing the right thing. Everybody knows he's doing the right thing. But you have a radical left sick culture that's a very dangerous group of people and they're trying to make him look bad. I believe he's going to win out. We're trying to give him China exciting news, but you have to be careful of China. We have they're going to make money deals with China. They have to deal with us, too. We have to be careful with China. Look, I have a great relationship with President Xi, but sometimes he gets testy because China likes to take advantage of people and they can't take advantage of us. But we have a fair relationship with China, and I think it'll be fine. And if it's not, that's okay, too. You'd have to do you have to do and go where the punches are thrown. You you got to put up the blocks. We have a lot of punches being thrown and we've been very successful. Look, we have the most success. I think we're the most successful we've ever been as a country. We have now close, I've been saying 17. We have, I think close to or maybe even exceeding $18 trillion going to be invested in the United States. That's more money than ever invested in any country before. Even countries with much bigger populations like India or like China. Nobody's ever had $18 trillion invested in the country we have. And that's because of November 5th election. Because I won. Oh, if if she won, you'd be negative. You know, people getting out of the country, this country would have been we would have been in a major depression. If she won, we would have been 1929. They'd like to see that anyway. That's why they keep the government was ever shut down based on nonsense. They want to give away 1.5. Think of it. They want to give away $1.5 trillion to people that come into the country illegally. And as you know, the borders now are closed. But when they hear that they get the greatest health care package in the world and they have no money, but they are living okay in another country they had. And they start forming caravans and they try and come into our country. But the big problem is they want to give they want to give health care to people that should not get health care. They want to give health care to illegal immigrants by the by the millions. Look at Gavin Newsom, what he's done. He's ruined. California gives health care to anybody.

您的建议是什么？只是核实一下您说过哈马斯向您保证他们会解除武装。那是直接对话还是通过像惠特科姆先生那样的人？通过我的最高层级，一旦您离开了，您可能会发现那是一个追捕我的非常糟糕的先例。后来在阿根廷，我说政治领导人的建议是坚守原则，因为他是对的，他正在证明他是对的。他有一个问题。他有一些人在给他制造非常糟糕的舆论，即使他们知道那是错的。他必须坚守自己的原则，因为他会赢。他会赢的。他正在做正确的事情。每个人都知道他正在做正确的事情。但你们有一种激进左翼的病态文化，那是一群非常危险的人，他们试图让他看起来很糟糕。我相信他会赢的。我们正在努力给他带来中国的振奋人心的消息，但你们必须小心中国。他们将与中国进行金钱交易。他们也必须与我们打交道。我们必须小心中国。听着，我与习主席关系很好，但有时他会变得暴躁，因为中国喜欢占别人的便宜，而他们不能占我们的便宜。但我们与中国保持着公平的关系，我认为这会很好。如果不好，那也没关系。你必须做，你必须做，并迎着拳头前进。你必须做好防守。我们有很多拳头正在被扔过来，我们一直非常成功。看，我们拥有最多的成功。我认为我们作为一个国家，比以往任何时候都更成功。我们现在已经接近，我一直说17万亿，我认为接近甚至超过18万亿美元将投资于美国。这比以往任何国家获得的投资都多。即使是人口比我们多得多的国家，比如印度或中国。以前没有任何一个国家获得过18万亿美元的投资，我们做到了。那是因为11月5日的选举。因为我赢了。哦，如果她赢了，你就会是负面的。你知道，人们会离开这个国家，这个国家将会陷入大萧条。如果她赢了，我们就会回到1929年。他们反正也想看到那样。这就是为什么他们一直让政府因为无稽之谈而关闭。他们想送出1.5万亿。想想看。他们想送出1.5万亿美元给非法进入这个国家的人。而且如你所知，边境现在已经关闭了。但当他们听到他们能得到世界上最好的医疗保健套餐，而且他们没有钱，但他们在一个他们曾经居住的国家生活得还不错时。他们就开始组织大篷车，试图进入我们的国家。但最大的问题是，他们想给那些不应该得到医疗保健的人提供医疗保健。他们想给数百万非法移民提供医疗保健。看看加文·纽森做了什么。他毁了加州，给任何人提供医疗保健。
