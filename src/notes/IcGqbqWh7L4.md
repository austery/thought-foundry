### 引言：以人为本的领导力

主持人：谢谢大家。在听完两位发言后，我感到非常荣幸能主持这次小组讨论。如你们所知，我们事先准备了一些问题，但现在听了你们的发言，我有了更多的问题。我实际上想从一个贯穿你们两人评论的主题开始，那就是关于“人”。梅雷特，我先从你开始，因为我发现一个有趣的现象：在你成为唯一的**首席执行官**（CEO: Chief Executive Officer，企业最高行政负责人）之前，你曾从事**人力资源**（HR: Human Resources，负责企业员工招聘、培训、薪酬福利等管理）工作，这通常不是一个能晋升到首席执行官职位的岗位。请告诉我们，通过领导人力资源职能，你学到了哪些关于领导力的知识？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. I feel very fortunate to be able to moderate a panel after having heard both of you. As you know, we had questions in advance, but I have so many more questions now that I've heard both of your remarks. And I actually want to start with something that was a theme through both of your comments, and that is around the people. Merete, I'll start with you because I find it interesting that prior to becoming the sole CEO, you had a career in HR or that's not typically a job that is promoted into the CEO role. Tell us a little bit about what you learned about leadership by leading the human resources function.</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：嗯，我知道这确实是一个有点不寻常的成为首席执行官的方式。回溯过去，之前有人提到了**安然公司**（Enron: 曾是美国最大的能源、商品和服务公司之一，因财务造假于2001年破产）。当时我正在**安达信**（Arthur Andersen: 曾是全球五大会计师事务所之一，因安然事件解体）工作，担任财务管理顾问，那件事导致了安达信的解体。在挪威，当时我们与**安永**（EY: Ernst & Young，全球四大会计师事务所之一）合并。安永大约有2000人，安达信也有2000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, uh, I know it's a little bit of an odd way to enter in as a CEO and and stepping back, it was previously talked about, you talked about Enron. Uh, I was working in Arthur Anderson at the time. I was a financial management consultant and it led to the dissolution of Anderson. And in Norway at that point in time, we were merged with EY. Uh, we were approximately 200 2,000 people in EY, 2,000 people in Arthur Anderson.</p>
</details>

每个人都认为这次合并会非常顺利和简单，因为这两家公司提供相同的服务。我被要求分析并实际负责合并这两家公司，并重新安置26个办公室。在那段时间里，我后来做了计算。有些合并效果很好，有些则不尽如人意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And everyone thought that this merger was going to be great and simple because the two companies they provided the same services. And I was asked to analyze and to uh to get the possibility actually to to merge these two and colllocate 26 offices. And during that time I did the math afterwards. Some of the collocations were were were great. Some of them were not so great.</p>
</details>

模式是这样的：在我们拥有出色领导力的地方，他们能够从文化角度融合在一起，因为当时这两家优秀公司的文化截然不同，但它们能够紧密合作，这确实奏效了，我们获得了出色的财务业绩。而在那些未能融合的地方，我们则遇到了困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the pattern was this where we had great leadership where they were able to come together from a cultural perspective because at that point in time the culture was quite different in these two great companies but it was different and sticky where they were able to work together that actually worked and we got financial great performance where they weren't we had a struggle so that actually made me want to move over to working with HR and and since then uh also during my studies I I studied psychology. I've done coaching and and I'm very passionate about the area.</p>
</details>

所以这让我想要转到人力资源领域工作，从那时起，在我的学习期间，我也学习了心理学，做过辅导，我对这个领域充满热情。因此，我常说，在大多数业务中，成功更多地取决于拥有合适的人，而不是其他任何因素。我感到很幸运，能够亲眼看到业绩与领导力之间如此紧密的联系，而且我每天都在学习关于领导力的新东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um I usually say that winning in most businesses is more about having the right people than anything else. I feel lucky that I have been able to actually see how performance is so tightly linked to leadership and I learned something new with respect to leadership every single day. Uh so as as long as you're able to sort of speak of these warm words culture and actually operationalize it in the way that we have in Visma uh it runs really nicely.</p>
</details>

只要你能够谈论这些“文化”的美好词汇，并像我们在Visma所做的那样将其付诸实践，一切就会运行得非常顺利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so as as long as you're able to sort of speak of these warm words culture and actually operationalize it in the way that we have in Visma uh it runs really nicely.</p>
</details>

### 多元化与包容性的核心作用

主持人：好的，谢谢。马克，我想接着你刚才结束的话题，那就是你对劳动力多元化和包容性作用的见解。正如你所暗示的，在美国，这无疑正承受着巨大的压力。但我想知道，鉴于你现在跨越多家公司，拥有21年首席执行官的领导历程，你是如何认识到，建立围绕多元化社区的文化对你所管理公司的成功如此重要的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Thank you. So Mark, I want to pick up on what you ended on and that is um what the insights that you've had around the role of diversity and inclusion in the workforce and as you also alluded to certainly in the United States that's something that is under tremendous pressure at the moment but I'm wondering given your journey your leadership journey now across multiple companies 21 years as a CEO how did you come to identify that um engaging and and and finding ways to build a culture culture around a diverse community was so central to the success of the companies that you've run.</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：我认为，就像大多数领导者和大多数公司一样，这都是一步步发生的，因为在这20年里，很多公司，很多事情都改变了。当我比较今天的高管领导团队，无论是雀巢、**费森尤斯**（Fresenius: 一家全球领先的医疗保健公司）还是我所了解的任何其他大公司，与20或25年前的情况相比，它无疑更加多元化。它以更好的方式代表着全球，性别代表性也更好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think like most leaders and most corporations, it happens step by step because those 20 years with a lot of company, a lot has changed. And um when I compare, you know, today's executive leadership team, whether it's Nestle, Fresenius or any other large company I'm aware of to what it was like uh 20 25 years ago, it's certainly a lot more diverse. it represents the globe in much better ways. There's better gender representation and um I found that in addition to bringing these different perspectives to the table, the tone of the table also changed.</p>
</details>

我发现，除了将这些不同的观点带到讨论中之外，讨论的氛围也改变了。它不再仅仅是强行推行某种观点，或者推土机式地压制其他论点。它关乎思想的真正竞争，坦率地说，大多数时候，它是一种更文明的辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's no longer just about ramming something through and bulldozing, you know, other arguments. It's about a true competition of ideas and also frankly most of the time a more civilized debate. And um so when you see that and when you see better decisions, better results coming out of that uh over time, step by step, you become a true believer.</p>
</details>

所以，当你看到这些，当你看到随着时间的推移，更好的决策和更好的结果从中产生时，你会一步步成为一个真正的信徒。不过，我确实想强调一点，这对我来说很重要。我的意思是，这些年来我们所有人都在做两件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I do want to highlight nonetheless and this is important to me. I mean we were doing two things all of us over those years. One is we were correcting historic wrongs. Let's not lose sight of that. Diversity inclusion is not a business tool only. Okay? It delivers results. It's it's one of these perfect cases of doing well and doing good at the same time. And that's important to me because let's not belittle it to just being a strategy.</p>
</details>

一是我们在纠正历史错误。我们不要忘记这一点。多元化和包容性不仅仅是一个商业工具。它能带来成果。这是一个同时做到“做好事”和“做得好”的完美案例。这对我来说很重要，因为我们不要把它贬低为仅仅是一种策略。

<details>

<p class="english-text">One is we were correcting historic wrongs. Let's not lose sight of that. Diversity inclusion is not a business tool only. Okay? It delivers results.

主持人：谢谢你的分享。

### 提升女性领导力与人才库

主持人：梅雷特，我知道对你来说，在多元化领域，女性是一个重要的部分。你谈到女性在Visma和其他地方积极参与工作的作用或你的愿望。请告诉我们为什么这对你很重要，以及你是如何看到它演变的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Merit, I know that part of what's important to you around the diversity space is women and you talk about the role of or your your desire to ensure that women are actively engaged in the work at Visma and other places. Tell us more about why that has been important to you and how you've seen it evolve.</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：嗯，具体来说，我认为这是多元化最重要的部分。马克，你刚才说得很好，增加人才库真的非常重要。我们所经历的，尤其是在科技领域，尤其是在你收购了许多优秀公司的情况下，总的来说，企业家中女性非常少。不幸的是，我几乎记不起我们收购的许多公司中，有女性企业家的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, specifically, I think it's uh the most important part of diversity. You mentioned it very well, Mark, and it's really important to increase the talent pool. And what we have experienced, especially in tech and especially when you acquire a lot of amazing companies in general, the entrepreneurs, there are very few female entrepreneurs. uh I unfortunately can hardly remember uh many companies that we have acquired where the females uh were entrepreneurs.</p>
</details>

我认为这可能也是平均而言的性别差异，即男性更倾向于冒险。如果我看看我们所有公司的投资组合，随着公司成长，变得更大、更结构化，会有更多的女性加入，并在更大程度上实现专业化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and I think that also is maybe on average a gender difference that that that men are more risktakers. If I look at the portfolio of all the companies we have as the companies grow and become more sizable and more structured we have more females coming in uh and actually professionalizing to a larger extent.</p>
</details>

有很多……我只是想把它平均化，但对我来说，增加人才库一直极其重要。有趣的是，你需要如何定制广告以及如何对待女性和男性，因为我们有不同的偏好。过去这些年，我们一直花大量时间确保我们“点拨”那些我们认为应该申请工作的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's lots of uh I'm just trying to sort of average it out, but for me it's been extremely important to increase the talent pool. It's been interesting to see how you need to tailor ads and how you approach females versus male because we have different preferences. uh we have always these past years been spending a lot of time making sure that we poke people uh on on their shoulder if we believe that they should actually apply for a job because on average a lot of males can look at a description and say I know 50% I'll go for it while the females go I know 90% I'm not going to apply so so actively pinpointing to get more people and a more diverse group in the process that has had a really good result and now we're actually at 36 and a half% of female leadership in Visma.</p>
</details>

因为平均而言，很多男性会看一份职位描述，然后说“我懂50%，我要去申请”，而女性则会说“我懂90%，我还是不申请”。所以，积极地指出并让更多人、更多元化的群体参与到这个过程中，取得了非常好的效果，现在Visma的女性领导层比例达到了36.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because on average a lot of males can look at a description and say I know 50% I'll go for it while the females go I know 90% I'm not going to apply so so actively pinpointing to get more people and a more diverse group in the process that has had a really good result and now we're actually at 36 and a half% of female leadership in Visma.</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：我能补充一点吗？这与我的经验非常吻合。我曾多次积极鼓励女性接受晋升，而她们觉得自己还没有准备好。我从未从男性那里听到过这种说法。所以很明显，这里有一些东西是需要你积极推动和努力才能实现的。同样的情况也发生在**工商管理硕士**（MBA: Master of Business Administration，一种专业硕士学位）课堂上，我经常看到这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Could I just build on that? That meshes incredibly well with my experience. So the number of times I was actively motivating, encouraging women to take a promotion where they felt they weren't ready. I've never heard that from a man. And so clearly there's something here that um you know you actively have to kind of push for and work forward to make it happen. That same dynamic happens in the MBA classroom as well. see that quite regularly.</p>
</details>

### 多元化团队中的创新与风险管理

主持人：嗯，多元化员工队伍的成果之一就是创新。有大量的研究表明，决策和创意生成中的多元化程度越高，创新和创造性成果就越多。但与此同时，当存在这种多元化时，由于人们处理世界的方式不同，它可能会变得有争议或具有挑战性。这可能需要更长的时间。你如何平衡多元化环境带来的巨大成果与当人们持有不同观点时经常产生的紧张关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so one of the outcomes of a diverse workforce is innovation. There's plenty of research that says that the more diversity you have in in the decision-m and the the idea generation, the more innovative, the more creative outcomes will will result. But at the same time when you have that diversity it's it's because there are differences in how people approach the world that it can become contentious or challenging. It can take longer. How do you balance the benefit of the great outcome from a diverse environment visav the the tension that is oftentimes created when you have people from disperate perspectives.</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：埃丽卡（主持人），冒着稍微扭曲创新概念的风险，我的意思是，显然在座的没有人会不同意创新是积极的事情。每个人都喜欢创新。但真正的考验是当它出错的时候。因为每次你尝试新事物时，根据你所尝试的事情，总会有一定的风险，它可能会失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Erica the risk of twisting it slightly when it comes to innovation. I mean obviously no one here in the room would disagree. It's a positive thing. Everyone loves innovation. Um the moment of truth is when it goes wrong. Mhm. Okay. Because every time you try something new um there is a certain risk depending on what you're endeavoring to do that it may fail and then what at that moment and that separates in my opinion the Sunday pep talk we all love innovation from walking the talk.</p>
</details>

那么在那一刻会发生什么呢？在我看来，这区分了我们都喜欢创新的“周日鼓舞士气谈话”与“言行一致”。所以，如果有人怀着最好的意图，无论这是否是一个多元化的领导团队，如果有人怀着最好的意图一直在努力推动组织发展，尝试新事物，产品创新、研发、或者新的营销活动，但它失败了。你如何处理这种情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so if someone with the best of intentions, no matter whether this is a diverse leadership team or not, whether some if someone with the best of intentions has been trying to advance the organization, has been trying new things, product innovation, R&D, whatever, a new marketing campaign and it falls flat. How do you handle that situation?</p>
</details>

这通常是坏消息。这通常是会变得显而易见的事情。你可能已经发布了产品，你可能会失去市场份额，你可能无法达到季度业绩。但尽管如此，我的意思是，这些时刻正是所有关于文化、正直和支持等良好品质受到考验的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's usually bad news. It's usually something that, you know, becomes visible. Uh, you may have announced the product. Uh, you may lose market share. you may not meet your quarterly results but nonetheless I mean those are the moments where all these good attributes about culture and you know integrity and being supportive and all of that that's what's being put to a test and if you then treat it like the world is coming to an end people will basically go back to their old behaviors and uh this is what I talked about earlier like moving away from the accountability like it's someone else's problem</p>
</details>

如果你把它当作世界末日来对待，人们基本上就会回到他们旧的行为模式，这就是我之前谈到的，就像逃避责任，把它当作别人的问题一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you then treat it like the world is coming to an end people will basically go back to their old behaviors and uh this is what I talked about earlier like moving away from the accountability like it's someone else's problem</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：你想补充什么吗？在Visma，我们区分了实验和项目。我想说，项目通常是我要完成预算，这是我们不能错过的。但在内部，我们可以做很多实验。我同意，关键在于你如何回应，如何推动业务，以及如何认识到实验是伟大的。我们甚至在收购公司方面进行实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you like to add anything to that well in in Visma we we have a difference between experiments and projects and I would say that projects are typically me delivering on the budget uh that's something that we can't miss but underneath the hood we can do a lot of experiments uh and uh and I agree that um it's how you respond and how you drive the business and actually figuring out that experiments are great and we even experiment on acquiring companies</p>
</details>

有时这也会出错，然后更重要的是“现在怎么办”，如何应对。因为当事情出错时，如果你指责他人，而不是专注于“好吧，它出错了，我们现在该怎么办，我们能从中吸取什么教训”，那么我们将继续创新和实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes that goes wrong as well and then it's more about what now how to how to react because when things go wrong if you fingerpoint and don't focus on okay it's gone wrong what do we do now what can we learn from this then we will continue to innovate and experiment so so I think it's a balancing act and it's not a simple one when it comes to your question on speed uh versus sort of experimenting I think it's important to uh depending on the line of business naturally but but but we have a lot of pilots going on and instead of making everything perfect we let several customers try the pilots and we get the feedback and then we fail fast.</p>
</details>

所以我认为这是一个平衡的行为，而且当涉及到你关于速度与实验的问题时，这并非易事。我认为这很重要，当然取决于业务线，但我们有很多试点项目正在进行。我们不是追求完美，而是让多个客户尝试试点，我们获得反馈，然后快速失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in general when we have experience we know that we have succeeded when we know if it's a success or a failure instead of waiting to the perfect launch h and then suddenly things go wrong because then you actually become more resilient and you're able to do all these experiments at once without this huge process that actually underpins the results.</p>
</details>

所以总的来说，当我们有经验时，我们知道当我们知道它是成功还是失败时，我们就成功了，而不是等到完美发布，然后突然出错。因为那样你实际上会变得更有韧性，你能够同时进行所有这些实验，而无需庞大的流程来支撑结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in general when we have experience we know that we have succeeded when we know if it's a success or a failure instead of waiting to the perfect launch h and then suddenly things go wrong because then you actually become more resilient and you're able to do all these experiments at once without this huge process that actually underpins the results.</p>
</details>

### 应对重大危机：以新冠疫情为例

主持人：我想接着这个概念谈谈，因为你们两位代表着不同类型的公司。Visma相对较新，仍处于高速增长模式等。你（马克）在雀巢工作多年，那是一家稳定、历史悠久的公司。在你任职期间，雀巢面临的最大挑战是什么？我谈到了危机。你在雀巢时不得不应对哪些重大的动荡事件？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I want to pick up on this concept because you both represent different types of of firms. Uh BISMA is relatively new. it's still in high hyperrowth mode etc. You spent many years at Nestle which is a stable long-standing company. What at in Nestle over the time that you were there um what have you seen as some of the biggest challenges? So I spoke about crisis. What were some of the big tumultuous events that you had to navigate when you were at at Nestle?</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：嗯，显然，一个值得普遍讨论的好例子是，所有公司都曾面临的“百年一遇”事件，比如**新冠疫情**（COVID: Coronavirus Disease，由新型冠状病毒引起的传染病），你如何应对？这是一个很好的例子，说明了去中心化的力量，因为不可能从地球上的一个地方来管理那种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, obviously a good one to talk about in general that uh touched all companies was uh how were you dealing with a once in a century event like CO and um good example of the power of decentralization because there was no way from one place on earth to try to manage that situation. uh there's a few things that you know you can give out as principles like uh you know you trust that people will follow those principles but uh all the laws locally were different and um the timelines were different and then you really I mean this is one of those moments where in my opinion culture shown because um you handle your own situation in our case Switzerland where the company is based and then you try to place some of these principles in the organization but then you have to trust that in 197 countries people will make it happen.</p>
</details>

有一些事情你可以作为原则发布，比如你相信人们会遵循这些原则，但各地法律不同，时间线也不同。然后你真的，我的意思是，在我看来，这是文化发挥作用的时刻。因为你处理你自己的情况，在我们的案例中是公司总部所在的瑞士，然后你尝试将其中一些原则植入组织中，但你必须相信在197个国家里，人们会使其实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh there's a few things that you know you can give out as principles like uh you know you trust that people will follow those principles but uh all the laws locally were different and um the timelines were different and then you really I mean this is one of those moments where in my opinion culture shown because um you handle your own situation in our case Switzerland where the company is based and then you try to place some of these principles in the organization but then you have to trust that in 197 countries people will make it happen.</p>
</details>

我清楚地记得2020年末发生的一件事。我们第一次与所有197个国家的人通过视频会议再次聚在一起。我想谈谈危机的下一阶段，但我注意到每个人都在谈论那一年以及它对他们的意义。我有点不耐烦了，我的一位亲爱的同事轻轻拉了拉我的衬衫，说：“让他们说吧。他们需要说。我的意思是，他们做了一些非常非常了不起的事情，那就是出色地适应了这场百年一遇的危机。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one of the events I literally remember from late 2020. Um the first time we were with all 197 back together on a video. Um I wanted to talk about the next stage of the crisis and um I noticed everyone was talking about that year and what it meant to them and I was getting a little impatient and one of my dear colleagues he was sort of tugging me on the shirt and saying let them talk. They need to talk. I mean they did something really really amazing and that is adjust to this once in a century crisis with flying colors.</p>
</details>

他们需要……每个人都有自己的创伤经历，他们需要倾诉，然后我们再过渡到讨论2021年要做什么。但这是其中一个例子，显然在一个广泛的全球合作中，如果你试图从一个地方处理这个问题，你就会失败，这就是文化发挥作用的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um they need everyone have their traumatic experience that need to talk and then we'll transition to you know what are we doing in 2021. Um but this is one of those where clearly in a broadbased global cooperation um if you're trying to handle this from one place you'll fail and this is where culture takes over.</p>
</details>

主持人：绝对如此。如果我的时间没记错，你是在2020年开始在Visma工作的。首席执行官是2020年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. So if I have my timing correct, you started at Visma in 2020. Uh the CEO 2020.</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：我是在2011年开始在Visma工作的。是的。但我是2020年社会封锁时开始担任首席执行官的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I started in Visma in 2011. Yes. But I started as CEO CEO in 2020 when society locked down.</p>
</details>

主持人：对。所以我想让你谈谈你作为领导者进入一个环境的经历。你已经在那里工作了一段时间，你有人际关系，你了解公司，但你是在世界因疫情而颠倒的时候，担任了重要的领导角色。请告诉我们你是如何观察文化帮助Visma度过那个时期，以及你作为领导者在其中扮演了什么角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So I wanted to I want to have you talk about your experience as a leader coming into an environment. You'd been there. You you had relationships, you knew the company, but you were coming into the prominent leadership role at the time when the world was being turned upside down because of the pandemic. Walk us through how you observed culture helping Visma navigate that time period and what role you played as a leader in that.</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：嗯，那绝对是特殊的时期。我想我们所有人都经历过人们需要连接，他们需要见面，而那段时间几乎不可能做到。所以我花了很多时间进行虚拟会议，自然地与整个组织沟通，与不同的领导层交谈，为我们所在的各个国家量身定制会议，因为不同的地方有不同的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it was definitely special times. I think all of us experienced that people need to connect. They need to meet up and that was close to impossible in that time. So I spent a lot of time having meetings virtually naturally speaking to the whole organization, speaking to the different leadership, having tailored meetings to the different countries where we were in because there were different challenges depending on where you were.</p>
</details>

我们有些公司比其他公司更害怕，因为人们正在撤出一些国家。所以我想我做的最重要的事情就是沟通、沟通、再沟通。确保我们的员工感到安全，我们会继续下去，我们会像往常一样开展业务，成为安全的港湾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we have some of our companies that were were sort of um more scared than others because people were pulling out of some of the countries. So it's I think the most important thing I did was communicate, communicate, communicate. Make sure that uh our employees felt safe, that we would continue, that we would do our business as we always had done, being the safe haven.</p>
</details>

此外，还要照顾我们的当地社区和客户。我们已经远程工作了很长时间，自然地，作为一家科技公司，但我们的许多客户并不习惯这种方式。因此，员工承受着巨大的压力，他们试图找出办法，当然还要确保尤其是客户支持部门，他们工作量非常大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and addition uh taking care of our local communities and our customers. And we had been working virtually a long time, naturally a tech business, but our customers, so many of them, they weren't used to this. So it was an immense pressure on the employees and trying to figure out of course making sure that especially customer support they were so heavily loaded with work uh trying to find these small openings making sure that we have walk and talk with people that move that live close to to one another. We have mentors coming around.</p>
</details>

我们努力寻找这些小机会，确保我们与住得近的人一起散步聊天。我们有导师过来。所以我们做了很多运营上的事情，只是非常贴近组织，与人们交谈，与很多人交谈，与人才交谈。总的来说，我想你可以说，在那样的时候，文化要么凝聚在一起，要么就会瓦解。

<p class="english-text">So we did a lot of operational things just being very close to the organization speaking to people speaking to a lot of people speaking to the talents uh and and in general I guess you can say in a time like that either the culture comes together or it sort of falls apart and and luckily for our sake we we really came together. I'm I'm really proud of what we accomplished but I'm so proud of what society accomplished in such an immense shift.</p>

幸运的是，对我们来说，我们真的凝聚在了一起。我为我们所取得的成就感到非常自豪，但我更为社会在如此巨大的转变中所取得的成就感到自豪。

### 文化、领导力与战略的统一

主持人：是的。我在商学院教授的一件事是文化，以及它实际意味着什么，它从何而来。**克里斯蒂安**（Christian）提到“文化把战略当早餐吃掉”，这是我们都听说过的一句话，但我们通常不会关注文化是如何真正形成的。我们与学生探讨的一件事是，文化由三个不同的要素组成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One of the things that uh I teach in business schools is culture and what that actually means and where it comes from and and Christian mentioned culture eat strategy for breakfast which is something that we've all heard um but we don't often pay attention to how culture is truly developed and one of the things that we explore with our students is that culture is a component of three different things.</p>
</details>

它包括理解你的公司、你的组织所处的环境或背景。它包括领导层以及领导者在公司中传播的价值观。它还包括现有的战略、流程或政策。当这三者都保持一致时，就会形成强大的文化。当你的公司所处的环境背景与领导价值观保持一致，而领导价值观又与所制定的战略和政策保持一致时，你就会创造出强大的文化，从而带来成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's sort of understanding the environment or the context that your your company your organization is in. It is the leadership and the values that are propagated by the leader but in that company and it's about the strategy or the processes or the policies that exist. And culture a strong culture is created when all three of those things are in alignment. when the environmental context that your firm is operating in is aligned with the leadership values which is aligned with with the strategy and the policies that are put in place and that's when you create a strong culture and that's what leads to results.</p>
</details>

你是否经历过或见过这三个领域出现不一致，从而导致你在维持文化凝聚力方面面临挑战的情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you experienced or seen times when there was a breakdown in the alignment of those three areas that led to challenges that you faced with keeping the culture together?</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：我不得不说我没有。所以，回到我成为首席执行官的时候，2020年社会被封锁了。我想说，从2020年到现在，一直是一个极端接着另一个极端。每次我们都能团结起来，共同努力，但这确实需要大量时间。确保你积极沟通，并确保人们理解。不是每个人都需要一直同意。每个人都有发言权，但不是每个人都有投票权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to say I haven't. So, uh, going back to when I became the CEO, 2020 society locked down and I think from 2020 up until now, it's been one extreme after the other, I have to say. And every time we we have been able to come together and and work together, but it does take a lot of time. Uh, making sure that you just actively communicate and make sure that people understand. Not everyone needs to agree all the time. Everyone has a voice, but not everyone has a vote.</p>
</details>

但只要解释我们所处的位置，保持冷静，深思熟虑地准备并随时准备行动，并确保人们理解我们为什么这样做。嗯，我不得不说，幸运的是我没有遇到过那样的机会。但也许你遇到过，因为你担任首席执行官的时间比我长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but just explaining where we are, keeping calm, thoughtfully prepared and ready to act and making sure that people understand why we do what we do. Um I I haven't had that opportunity luckily I have to say. Uh but maybe you have because you have been a CEO longer than me.</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：时间确实更长。但是，我也没有见过那种彻底的崩溃。请记住，我同意一致性很重要，让这三个维度保持一致并非一蹴而就，也不是在图纸上画一天就能完成的。这是一个随着时间推移而不断调整的过程，希望它们能保持紧密联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's been longer. But look, I also haven't witnessed that complete meltdown. Uh do keep in mind I agree the consistency is important to bring all of these three dimensions in alignment is not something that happens on one day on a drawing board. It's something that you kind of move over time and then hopefully it stays close to each other.</p>
</details>

一旦出现偏差，通常是因为环境发生了某种变化。你的行业发生了变化，你的人员之间发生了变化，一些事情真正使其陷入失衡状态。我认为重要的是要及早对此做出反应，以免它瓦解。所以，这就像是，你可能一开始只听到一点点噪音，然后突然间就“砰”的一声。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and the minute something price lose it's usually because of some sort of change in the environment. Something's changing your industry, something's changing among your people. um something that really kind of brings it into a state of imbalance. And I think it is important then to react early to that before it disintegrates. So it's one of those where first you might just hear a little noise and then all of a sudden goes poof and so it's important to recognize that early and do something about it because afterwards it takes a long time to put it back together again.</p>
</details>

所以重要的是要及早认识到这一点并采取行动，因为之后要花很长时间才能将其重新整合起来。

### 领导力旅程中的关键时刻

主持人：绝对如此。我们只剩下几分钟了，我想问你们每人一个问题，那就是当你们回顾自己的领导力旅程时，是否有过一个关键的经历，它真正标志着你们作为领导者的思想和行动方式的转变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. We have just a couple minutes left and I want to ask a question for each of you and that is as you reflect on your own leadership journey. Were there or has there been a pivotal experience for you that really was a demarcation in terms of being a transformation to how you thought and act as a as a leader?</p>
</details>

马克·施耐德：你先来吗？嗯，你看，你之前提到了**微观管理**（micromanagement: 对员工工作进行过度细致的控制和监督），提到了**尼古拉**（Nikolai），这对我来说敲响了警钟。那大约是20、21年前发生的一件事。那是我在费森尤斯担任首席执行官的第一年，当时一切都进展得非常好。我为事情的进展感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you want to go first? Yeah. Um so look when you mentioned micromanagement earlier and uh talking about Nikolai that kind of rang a bell with me and uh it was a situation about um 20 21 years ago. It was my first year as CEO at Fresenius and things were going incredibly well. I was very proud of how things were going.</p>
</details>

我与董事长保持着非常好的关系，他非常支持我，并给予我所需的所有支持、建议和指导。有一次在董事会会议后，他把我叫到一边，基本上说：“你看，作为董事长，我对你这个首席执行官再满意不过了。你勤奋、透明、对事实了如指掌。但我不太确定我是否想成为为你工作的人之一。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Had a fantastic relationship with the chairman uh who's very supportive and um gave me all the support and advice and um and and coaching I needed. and at one point after a board meeting took me aside and basically saying look I couldn't be happier as a chair with you as a co you're hardworking you're transparent you're on top of the facts I'm not sure I would want to be one of the people working for you okay nice to hear that from your chairman um the way he shoed in it was absolutely spoton because and this was not out of bad intentions when you get promoted to a job like this age 37 you don't want to fail you working hard and uh you you're basically trying to ensure everything works just so and in that process unfortunately you become too prescriptive for the next people working for you.</p>
</details>

好吧，从你的董事长那里听到这些真是太好了。他指出这一点的方式绝对是恰到好处的，因为这并非出于恶意。当你37岁被提拔到这样的职位时，你不想失败，你努力工作，你基本上试图确保一切都顺利进行。不幸的是，在这个过程中，你对为你工作的下属变得过于**指令性**（prescriptive: 过分强调规则和细节，限制下属的自主性）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay nice to hear that from your chairman um the way he shoed in it was absolutely spoton because and this was not out of bad intentions when you get promoted to a job like this age 37 you don't want to fail you working hard and uh you you're basically trying to ensure everything works just so and in that process unfortunately you become too prescriptive for the next people working for you.</p>
</details>

所以这并非出于恶意。我并不认为在我职业生涯的其余时间里我是一个微观管理者。我需要那样的推动，他说的很有道理。我记得那可能是我在商业生涯中喝过的最好的一杯咖啡。我不记得那是什么牌子的咖啡了，但他给我的建议非常非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's it's not out of bad intentions. I don't think generally for the rest of my career I was a micromanager. It needed that nudge and he had a point and I remember that was probably the best cup of coffee in business I ever had. I don't remember what brand of coffee it was, but the advice I got was super super helpful.</p>
</details>

因此，多年来，只要我确信人们朝着同一个方向努力，我就会让他们以自己的方式去解决问题，他们会为此感到自豪，这会增加他们对业务的忠诚度。正如你之前提到的，我认为，作为领导者，当他们找到你不知道的方法时，那种自豪感是多么美妙。没有人能一直拥有所有答案，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result of that over the years, uh, you know, as long as I'm convinced that people are pulling in the same direction, let them figure it out in their ways and, uh, you know, they will take the pride in it, it'll create more allegiance to the business on their side and, uh, as um, you mentioned earlier, I think, you know, that pride for as a leader of them finding ways that you weren't aware of, you know, that that's something wonderful. No one has it all the time, right?</p>
</details>

主持人：绝对如此。梅雷特，你有什么要补充的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Anything for you, Maretta?</p>
</details>

梅雷特·赫韦恩：嗯，很快地说，我认为我最有学习意义的经历是当年我聘请了一位总经理。他曾是另一家公司的首席执行官。他制定了完整的战略。他在各个方面都非常出色。但当他加入时，他做出了所有正确的决定，但他无法让人们与他同行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, very quickly, I think my most learning experience was I hired a managing director back in the days. He had been a CEO uh another company. He had the whole strategy planned out. He was amazing on all aspects. But when he joined, he made all the right decisions, but he wasn't able to get the people along for the ride.</p>
</details>

所以，一年后我不得不解雇那个人。对我来说，那是一次非常重要的学习经历。作为一名总经理，作为一名领导者，你必须迅速而坚定地做出决策。但如果你无法让人们与你同行，你就会失业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I had to fire that person one year later. And uh for me that was a very important learning experience. You have to as a managing director, as a leader, you have to make decisions with speed and conviction. But if you don't get the people along for the ride, h you're out of a job.</p>
</details>

主持人：说得好。非常感谢两位。
