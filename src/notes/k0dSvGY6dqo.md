### 引言：野火季背后的隐形危机

我是《纽约时报》的雷切尔·艾布拉姆斯（Rachel Abrams），这里是《The Daily》节目。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily.</p>
</details>

随着野火季节变得越来越长、越来越致命，各州正日益依赖私人公司向火灾前线提供数千名消防员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As wildfire seasons grow longer and deadlier, states are increasingly relying on private companies to provide thousands of firefighters to the front lines.</p>
</details>

今天，我的同事汉娜·德莱尔（Hannah Dryer）解释了监管规则的缺失和漏洞如何让许多这些消防员生病、负债累累，并孤立无援。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, my colleague Hannah Dryer explains how lacks rules and regulatory loopholes have left many of these firefighters sick, in debt, and on their own.</p>
</details>

今天是10月28日，星期二。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's Tuesday, October 28th.</p>
</details>

汉娜，感觉每年野火都在增多，你花了数月时间调查野火的一个特定方面，那就是野火扑救行业。所以，我想先请你告诉我们，是什么让你对这个特定角度产生了兴趣？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hannah, it feels like every year there are more and more wildfires and you have spent months investigating one specific aspect of wildfires, which is the wildfire fighting industry. So, I'd love to start off with you telling us what got you interested in that particular angle.</p>
</details>

我第一次开始思考这个问题是在一月份洛杉矶发生火灾之后。我看到有大量的视频和照片，都是关于那些扑灭火灾的人。我忍不住注意到，所有这些消防员都站在看起来像是剧毒的黑烟中，而且他们都没有戴口罩。这让我不禁想知道为什么会这样？在那种没有保护的环境中工作可能会带来什么后果？于是我开始深入调查野火扑救行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I first started thinking about this after the fires that tore through Los Angeles in January. I saw that there was all this footage, all these pictures coming in of the people who were fighting those fires. And I couldn't help but notice that there were all of these firefighters out there standing in what looked like the most toxic black smoke and none of them were wearing masks. And it got me wondering why is that? And what might be the consequences of working in that kind of environment with no protection? And so I started digging into the industry of people who fight wildfires.</p>
</details>

我发现这个行业完全不同于其他任何行业。他们身处真正危险的环境中，并且在没有保护的情况下工作。他们中很多人在年轻时就病得很重。当他们患上严重的肺损伤或癌症等与**烟雾暴露**（Smoke Exposure: 接触燃烧产生的烟雾）相关的疾病时，他们往往孤立无援。他们通常甚至没有基本的医疗保险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I discovered is that it's completely unlike any industry. They are out there in these really hazardous conditions and they work without protection. And a lot of them are getting very sick at young ages. And when they develop things like severe lung damage or cancer, things that are linked to this smoke exposure, they're often on their own. Often they don't even have basic health insurance.</p>
</details>

这意味着，从开始工作到真正生病，这些消防员在这个过程的几个不同阶段都处于弱势。没错。很多人告诉我，他们觉得为了保护他人而冒着健康风险，但当自己生病时，却没有人保护他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically they're vulnerable at several different stages of this process from starting work to actually getting sick. Exactly. I mean what a lot of people have told me is they feel like they put their health on the line to protect people and then when they get sick themselves there's sort of no one there protecting them.</p>
</details>

这不是一个小问题。现在有成千上万的人几乎全年都在做这项工作。随着野火季节变得越来越长、越来越强烈，这个问题只会变得越来越紧迫。为了全面了解这个问题，我采访了数百名消防员。他们中很多人病得很重，但有一个故事让我印象特别深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is not a small issue. There are tens of thousands of people who do this work almost year round now. And as wildfire season grows longer and gets more intense, this is something that is just going to become more and more urgent. So to get my arms around this, I talked to hundreds of firefighters. Many of them were very sick, but there was one story that really stood out to me.</p>
</details>

### Joel Eisinger的故事：从梦想走向噩梦

“嗨，请进。我是马特，乔尔的爸爸。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, come on in. I'm Matt. I'm Joel's dad.</p>
</details>

这是一个名叫乔尔·艾辛格（Joel Eisinger）的年轻人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a young man named Joel Eisinger.</p>
</details>

“那么，我们可以从你的童年开始讲起吗？”“就是骑了很多自行车，参加了很多比赛。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, can we go all the way back to your childhood and start there? just a lot of riding bicycles and a lot of races.</p>
</details>

乔尔是个害羞的孩子，经常搬家。他交朋友并不总是那么容易。他非常热爱运动，经常长途徒步、长途骑自行车。他在高中时打长曲棍球，绰号是“攻城槌”。但他学习时很难集中注意力，有时会逃课，勉强才毕业。毕业后，他不知道自己该做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joel was a shy kid who moved around a lot. He didn't always have an easy time making friends. He was really physical. He went on long hikes, long bike rides. He played lacrosse in high school and his nickname was battering ram. But he had a hard time focusing in school. Sometimes he didn't go to class. He sort of barely managed to graduate. And once he graduated, he wasn't sure what he was going to do.</p>
</details>

“呃，在塔可钟（Taco Bell）找了份工作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, got a job at Taco Bell.</p>
</details>

他当时住在俄勒冈州，在塔可钟工作。一天晚上，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was living in Oregon. He got a job at Taco Bell. And one night,</p>
</details>

“我看了一部叫《勇往直前》（Only the Brave）的电影。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I watched a movie called Only the Brave.</p>
</details>

“我在蒙大拿州大蒂姆伯附近扑灭了这场大火。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I worked this blaze near Big Timber, Montana.</p>
</details>

他开始在电视上看这部名叫《勇往直前》的电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He started watching this movie on TV called Only the Brave.</p>
</details>

“无论发生什么，我们都不能回去。大家在一起。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No matter what's going on, we can't go back up there. Stay together. Everyone here.</p>
</details>

这部电影讲述了几年前发生的一场悲剧，基本上整个野外消防队都被大火烧死了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a movie that's about this tragedy that happened a few years ago where basically an entire crew of wildland firefighters died burned by a fire.</p>
</details>

“汤，我只是想感谢你之前把我拉了出来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Soup. I just want to thank you for pulling me out earlier.</p>
</details>

“那肯定很吓人，不是吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was definitely an ass pucker, wasn't it?</p>
</details>

“毫无疑问，伙计。我以为我快死了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No doubt, man. I thought I was dying.</p>
</details>

这是一部悲剧电影，但乔尔的反应是关注这些队员之间的羁绊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's this tragic movie, but his reaction to it was to focus on the bond between these crew members.</p>
</details>

“如果这不是世界上最棒的工作，我不知道什么才是。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This ain't the greatest job in the world. I don't know what is.</p>
</details>

“说得对。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Got that right.</p>
</details>

在电影中，这些家伙总是开玩笑，关系非常亲密。这深深吸引了乔尔。他白天在快餐店工作，对他来说，这就像是“天哪，这是一种可以在户外、交朋友，并做他最擅长的事情——体力活的方式。”所以，第二天，他就去一家名叫**Pacific Oasis**（Pacific Oasis: 一家私人消防公司）的公司应聘了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, in the movie, these guys are always joking. They're really close. And that really appealed to Joel. I mean, he's working at like a fast food restaurant during the day. And to him, this is like, oh my god, it's a way to be outside, have friends, and be doing what he's best at, which is this sort of like physical work. So, the very next day, he goes and applies to work for a company called Pacific Oasis.</p>
</details>

那么，Pacific Oasis是做什么的？Pacific Oasis是现在数百家向联邦政府提供**私人消防服务**（Private Firefighting Services: 由私人企业提供的消防服务）的公司之一。这些工作比直接为联邦政府从事消防工作更容易获得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's Pacific Oasis? Pacific Oasis is one of hundreds of companies that now offer private firefighting services to the federal government. And these are easier jobs to get than working directly for the federal government doing firefighting.</p>
</details>

比如，繁文缛节更少。是的。需要填写的文书更少，需要通过的障碍也更少。你可以当场被录用。所以他们吸引了很多像乔尔这样可能在生活中有些迷茫的人。因此，这份工作比为联邦政府工作更容易获得。但也有一个弊端，那就是保护措施和福利要少得多。例如，大多数为这些公司工作的人没有医疗保险。他们接受的培训更少，总的来说，他们受到的保护也更少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like less red tape. Yeah. Less paperwork to fill out, fewer hoops to jump through. You can get hired on the spot. And so they attract a lot of people like Joel who maybe were a little a drift in life. So it's an easier job to get than working for the federal government. But there's a trade-off, which is that there are a lot fewer protections and fewer benefits. So most people working for these companies don't have health insurance, for example. They have less training and overall they're just sort of less protected.</p>
</details>

“嗯，我在塔可钟有个经理。他提到了Pacific Oasis。所以我脑子里已经有了这个想法，他只是告诉我所有那些很酷的故事，我就想，‘哦，这太棒了，伙计。’你知道，他说，‘我不会雇任何人。我只是想……’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so at Taco Bell, I had a manager. He brought up Pacific Oasis actually. So like I had that in my head already and uh he just told me all the cool stories and I was like, "Oh, this is sweet, man." You know, he's like, "I don't hire anybody. I just want</p>
</details>

乔尔走进门，他见到了公司的总裁。总裁说：“你正是我们正在寻找的人。”然后当场就让他报名参加培训。他几乎立即就被派去扑灭一场大火。当时他才18岁。他的父亲马特（Matt Eisinger）记得开车送他去Pacific Oasis总部的情景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Joel walks in the door. He meets with the president of the company. He's like, "This is uh you're exactly what we're looking for." And signs him up for training straight away on the spot. And he's almost immediately sent out to a major fire. And he's still 18 at this point. His father, Matt, remembers driving him down to the Pacific Oasis headquarters.</p>
</details>

“所以我跟他一起去了那里，把他送到火灾现场，就像送他去参加体育赛事一样，你懂我的意思吗？当然，我非常担心他，我想大多数父母都会这样。但是……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I went down there with him and dropped him off at the fire like it was a sporting event, you know what I mean? And I was incredibly worried about him, of course, as I I think most parents would be. But</p>
</details>

马特非常担心乔尔会陷入这种真正危险的境地。他知道儿子有点固执，有时可能会挑战极限。他知道他无法阻止乔尔报名参加这项工作。乔尔心意已决，但他真的很担心。可以理解，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Matt was so worried that Joel was going to go out in this really dangerous situation. He knows his son is sort of hard-headed, maybe sometimes push his boundaries. And he knew he couldn't stop Joel from signing up for this work. Joel was determined, but he was really worried. Understandably, right?</p>
</details>

“所以史蒂夫看到我紧张地踱步等待。史蒂夫走过来，他走近我，我当时在外面……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Steve saw me just nervously pacing and waiting. and he Steve came up to me and he approached me and I was staying out of</p>
</details>

Pacific Oasis的总裁史蒂夫·多兹（Steve Dods）走过来和马特交谈，并向他保证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Steve Dods who's the president of Pacific Oasis comes over and talks to Matt and reassures him</p>
</details>

“他说，‘嘿，我们会好好照顾他的。他会没事的。’任何人都可以这么说，但我真的相信了他。我当时很尊敬他。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he said, "Hey, we'll take good care of him. He's going to be all right." And anybody could say that, but I truly did believe him. I I respected him at that.</p>
</details>

然后乔尔坐上卡车，开往他的第一场火灾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Joel gets in a truck and he drives off to his very first fire.</p>
</details>

“那么，你能告诉我们你的第一场火灾吗？”“呃，那就像加利福尼亚的火灾蔓延到了俄勒冈边境。所以我们在那里保护它不进入俄勒冈。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, can you tell us about your first fire? Uh it was like California coming to the Oregon border. So we were there to like protect it coming into Oregon.</p>
</details>

这场火灾名叫克拉马森火灾（Clamathon fire）。每场火灾都有一个名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This fire was called the Clamathon fire. Every fire has a name.</p>
</details>

“所以我们做了很多直接的手工防火线。那就是你在火线边缘，向下挖到裸露的矿物土壤，制造一个小的防火带，让火势停止。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we were doing a lot of direct hand line. So that's you're at the fire's edge. You're digging down to like bare mineral soil creating like a small fire break that the fire stops.</p>
</details>

### 野火前线的危险与“硬汉”文化

扑灭野火不像我们通常想象的消防工作。通常不涉及水和水管。它更像是挖一条隔离线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So fighting a wildfire is not like what we sort of imagine when we think of firefighting. There's not usually water and hoses involved. It's more like you're digging a containment line.</p>
</details>

我肯定会认为任何消防工作都需要水。所以，这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would definitely think that any kind of firefighting required water. So, this is interesting.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，野火太大，无法用水扑灭。它们只能被困住和控制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, what it is is that wildfires are too big to put out with water. They can really only be trapped and contained.</p>
</details>

“你只是想阻止它在地面蔓延。基本上，小火焰在闷烧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're just trying to stop it from spreading on the ground. Basically, small flames smoldering. And</p>
</details>

但这对像乔尔这样的人来说意味着，你就在火旁边工作，以一种令人难以置信的方式。乔尔的第一个晚上基本上是在悬崖边上，紧挨着活跃的火灾现场跋涉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what that means for somebody like Joel is that you're just working right next to the fire in a way that's sort of unbelievable. Joel's first night was basically trapesing around on a cliff's edge right next to the act of fire.</p>
</details>

“那第一场火灾最可怕的部分是，呃，他们称之为‘货运列车’。你开始听到火的声音。你看不见它，但你就是开始听到树木燃烧和奔跑的声音。听起来就像，是的，列车。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The scariest part about that first fire was uh they call it a freight train. You start hearing the fire. You can't see it, but you just start hearing trees just torching and running. It sounds like Yeah. train.</p>
</details>

他告诉我他听到树木折断的声音。所以，他正在通过检查站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He told me about how he was hearing trees snapsh. So, he's crossing checkpoints.</p>
</details>

“国民警卫队（National Guard）在那里。呃，他们现在关闭了所有高速公路。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">National Guard was there. Uh they shut down all highways now.</p>
</details>

他可以开车绕过他们，和他的队员一起进入这个禁区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he gets to drive around them to go to this sort of offlimit space with his crew.</p>
</details>

“嗯，我当时觉得这是有史以来最酷的事情，你知道。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I'm like I thought it was the coolest thing ever, you know.</p>
</details>

这是一个狂野而不可预测的场景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's this wild unpredictable scene.</p>
</details>

“简直是纯粹的混乱，伙计。火焰开始蔓延，风向改变……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's pure chaos, dude. Flames start ripping, wind changes</p>
</details>

他就在这些火焰旁边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where he is right next to these flames,</p>
</details>

“我们两边都是火。我抬头一看，一道200英尺高的火墙就在离我50英尺的地方，我就像所有人一样……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">fire on both sides of us. It's like I look up like a 200t wall of flames just like 50 ft away from me and I'm just like everybody's</p>
</details>

他开始认识这些家伙，他们教他如何在野外生存和保持安全，但也取笑他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he's starting to get to know these guys who are sort of teaching him how to be out there and stay safe but also teasing him.</p>
</details>

“我最亲密的朋友都是在那第一场火灾中认识的，你知道，我一直保持着那个圈子。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My closest friends I met on that first fire, you know, I've kept that circle</p>
</details>

对他来说，一切都如他所愿，去扑灭一场野火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for him. It was everything he had hoped it might be to to go out and fight a wildfire.</p>
</details>

听起来他找到了他真正向往的“兄弟连”元素。绝对是。所以在那之后，他基本上就上瘾了。他又工作了六个火灾季节。他学会了使用电锯。这意味着他会走在其他队员的前面，带领这群人深入森林，砍伐树木，砍掉燃烧的树枝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like he found that Band of Brothers element that he was really drawn to. Absolutely. So after that, he was pretty much hooked. He worked six more fire seasons. He learned to work a chainsaw. And that meant that he would sort of be out in front of the rest of the crew leading this group of guys deep into the woods, cutting down trees, cutting down flaming branches.</p>
</details>

“我花了大约三年时间才能在森林里行走而不摔倒，如果这说得通的话。比如带着电锯，带着所有的重量，大约花了三年时间。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It took me three about 3 years to be able to walk through the woods without falling over, if that makes sense. like with a chainsaw with all the weight took about 3 years.</p>
</details>

他会背着50磅的背包徒步，只有他、他的朋友和大自然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He would be hiking with a 50 lb pack just you know him, his friends and nature.</p>
</details>

“你脱离了日常生活，我个人不喜欢日常生活。所以我就喜欢那样，你知道。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're you're removed from like everyday life and I don't like everyday life personally. So it's like I like that you know</p>
</details>

这确实对体力要求很高，但对他来说也很有意义，让他感到自豪。他觉得这终于是一件他天生就很擅长的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's really physically demanding but it was also for him really rewarding and made him proud. He felt like it was finally something that he was just naturally good at.</p>
</details>

“只是自由。扑火不像是工作。那就像我们在外面做的假装游戏，你知道吗？那简直是仙境。所以，这很酷。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just freedom. Being on fires doesn't feel like a job. It's like makebelieve stuff that we do out there, you know? It's just fairy land [ __ ] So, it's cool.</p>
</details>

但这其中也涉及很多风险。他曾有一次从燃烧的山坡上摔下来。他差点用电锯砍到自己的脚。他全身都得了毒藤皮炎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it also involved a lot of risk. He fell down a burning hill once. He almost cut into his foot with his chainsaw. He got full body poison oak.</p>
</details>

这项工作最危险的事情之一是火灾的自然副产品，那就是吸入烟雾。那里没有人戴口罩。他们为什么不戴口罩？他开始这项工作时，公司没有提供口罩。而且也不允许戴。这是**林业局**（Forest Service: 美国农业部下属机构，负责管理国家森林和草原）的一项长期政策。林业局表示，戴口罩可能会增加中暑的风险。这项工作非常辛苦。通常天气很热。他们担心如果你在户外戴着东西遮住脸，可能会开始过热。世界上其他地方的野外消防员确实戴口罩，而且没有出现中暑问题，但这就是林业局的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the most dangerous things about the work was a natural byproduct of fires, which was breathing in smoke. and nobody out there wore masks. Why wouldn't they wear masks? Masks weren't provided when he started this work. And they also weren't allowed. And this is a longtime Forest Service policy. And what the Forest Service says is that wearing a mask could increase your risk of heat stroke. The work is really taxing. It's usually pretty hot out there. And the concern is if you're out there with something over your face, maybe you would start to overheat. Wildland firefighters in other parts of the world do wear masks and there has not been a heat stroke issue there, but that's what the Forest Service says.</p>
</details>

但也有这种不想显得软弱的文化因素。消防员们认为口罩很傻，是你不胜任这份工作的标志。吸入烟雾被视为你愿意做出牺牲、专注于手头工作、不顾及自身舒适的标志。所以基本上，即使他们得到了口罩，你的意思是他们可能也不会戴，因为这种文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there was also this cultural element of not wanting to seem weak. Firefighters sort of see masks as like silly as a sign that you're not going to be up to the job. And breathing in smoke is seen as a sign that you're willing to, you know, take sacrifices and focus on the work at hand and you're not going to get too caught up in your own comfort. So basically, even if they had been provided with masks, what you're saying is that they probably wouldn't have worn them because of this culture.</p>
</details>

是的，确实存在这种“硬汉”消防文化，但我也认为值得注意的是，当时像乔尔这样的消防员并没有被告知烟雾有任何值得担忧的原因。所以部分原因可能是他们认为戴口罩会让他们看起来软弱，但他们也可能没有理由认为戴口罩会有真正的益处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there is this macho fireline culture, but I also think it's worth noting that at this point, firefighters like Joel weren't told that there was any reason to be concerned about smoke. So part of it maybe is that they thought that the masks could make them look weak, but they also maybe just had no reason to think that there would be a real benefit to wearing them.</p>

### 烟雾的代价：疾病与背叛

但烟雾暴露确实非常严重。Pacific Oasis的工人们告诉我，在他们的消防营地里，早晨听起来就像一个肺气肿诊所。他们咳嗽，鼻子里流出黑色的东西。有一种叫做“营地病”（camp cred）的东西在这些消防营地里传播，每个人都会咳嗽，每个人都会感到不适，人们只是认为这是工作的自然结果。对乔尔来说，这有点像身体酸痛。他只是认为这是扑火工作的一部分。对他来说，这是他做对了事情、付出了足够努力的证明。他非常专注于引起老板史蒂夫的注意，向史蒂夫展示他很坚韧，应该被派去扑灭更多的火灾，也许还能得到晋升。所以，他工作非常努力。他试图给史蒂夫留下深刻印象。向史蒂夫展示他会做出任何牺牲。

<p class="english-text">But the smoke exposure was really intense. Pacific Oasis workers told me morning sounded like an emphyma clinic in their fire camps. They were coughing. They had black stuff coming out their noses. There's something called camp cred that goes around these fire camps where everyone will be coughing and everyone will be sort of feeling sick and people just think of it as like a natural consequence of the work. For Joel, it was sort of like being sore. It was just something that he thought came along with fighting fires. And for him, it was proof that he was doing something right and he was putting in the right amount of effort. He was really focused on trying to get his boss Steve's attention and show Steve that he was tough and he should be sent out on more fires and maybe promoted. So, he was working really hard. He was trying to impress Steve. Show Steve that he would make any sacrifice. And</p>

他会咳出黑色的东西。没错。连续几周不抱怨地工作。他得到了积极的评价。史蒂夫似乎很喜欢他所做的一切。最终，史蒂夫邀请他开始接受培训，成为一名班组长，这意味着他将带领自己的大约20人的团队。对乔尔来说，那是他一生中最自豪的时刻之一。这让他感到非常被认可。

<p class="english-text">he would cough up black stuff. Exactly. Go out for weeks and weeks without complaining. and he was getting these positive reviews. Steve seemed to be liking what he was doing. And eventually Steve invited him to start training to be a crew boss, which meant that he would lead his own team of about 20 people. And that for Joel was one of the proudest moments of his life. It was so validating.</p>
</details>

“你有没有想过把整个职业生涯都投入到消防工作中？”“哦，是的。我早就知道我会一直干下去。是的。我19岁的时候就知道那是我想要的工作。我可能会一直坚持下去。你知道，我很擅长。我真的很擅长。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Did you imagine spending your whole career in fire? Oh, yeah. I already knew I was in. Yeah. I knew that's a job I wanted probably when I was 19. I was probably going to stick with that one. you know, I'm good at it. I'm really good at it.</p>
</details>

他开始认为这可能是他一生的职业。这就是为什么接下来发生的事情让他感到如此背叛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he started to see this as probably being his lifelong career. And that's why what happened next felt like such a betrayal.</p>

汉娜，听起来乔尔基本上过着他梦想中的生活。事情什么时候开始变得糟糕的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Hannah, it sounds like Joel is basically living his dream life. When do things start taking a turn for the worst for him?</p>
</details>

是的。回想起来，呃，我有很多不同的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So looking back at it, uh I had a lot of different signs.</p>
</details>

去年一切都开始瓦解。那是七月四日周末。

<p class="english-text">Everything started falling apart last year. It was the 4th of July weekend.</p>

<p class="english-text">You know, I was extremely probably the best shape I ever been in my life before that. You know, I just did my crew boss class.</p>

他当时正在北加州扑灭一场火灾，住在一家酒店里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">He was fighting a fire in Northern California staying in a hotel.</p>
</details>

“我身上起了皮疹。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I broke out in a rash.</p>

他身上起了奇怪的皮疹，沿着他的腿蔓延。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He had this strange rash that was sort of creeping up his legs</p>
</details>

“我的身体，而且太疼了，伙计。我不知道发生了什么。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my body and it was so painful, dude. And I didn't know what was going on.</p>
</details>

真的很疼。看起来是他从未见过的东西，但他不想抱怨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It really hurt. It looked like nothing he'd ever seen before, but he didn't want to complain.</p>
</details>

“我们住在酒店里，对吧？所以每个人都说，‘哦，你得了臭虫。’每个人都吓坏了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're staying in hotels, right? So everybody was like, "Oh, you got bed bugs." Everybody's like freaking out.</p>
</details>

所以他没有理会。然后他的队员深入森林，开始在那里露营，以更接近火线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so he let it slide. Then his crew moves deep into the forest and they start camping there to get closer to the fire line.</p>
</details>

“到了第九天或第十天，我的脸开始下垂。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And day nine or 10, my face started to like droop.</p>
</details>

那时他的队员注意到他的脸下垂了。他半边嘴巴有点张开着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's when his crew mates notice that his face is drooping. Half of his mouth is sort of just hanging open.</p>
</details>

“你每次去扑火，总会有一件事困扰你。你会起水泡，或者指甲受伤。你总会有一些问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every fire you go on, there's going to be one thing that's always bugging you. You're going to have blisters, something, some fingernail messed up. You're going to have something.</p>
</details>

他再次想被视为一个坚韧的人，一个可以成为班组长的人。所以他继续工作，每天工作12小时，直到他们部署结束。那时一名医护人员终于看到了他，并说：“你需要去医院。你可能中风了。”在他脸下垂的这段时间里，人们担心他吗？我们知道吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, he wants to be seen as this, you know, tough person who could be a crew boss. And so he keeps going, working these 12-hour shifts until the end of their deployment. That's when a medic finally sees him and says, "You need to get to the hospital. You might have had a stroke." Were people worried about him? Do we know during the period that he's working with a a drooping face?</p>
</details>

你知道，人们注意到了，但没有人那么担心。我认为这部分原因可以追溯到这种火线文化。我的意思是，消防员说如果你在火线上受伤了，就擦点土继续走。天哪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, people noticed it, but nobody was that worried. And I think that partly goes back to this fire line culture. I mean, firefighters say if you get injured out on the fire line, you just rub dirt in it and keep walking. Oh my god.</p>
</details>

所以每个人都非常专注于控制火势，无论发生什么都继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, everybody is just very focused on getting this fire under control and keeping going sort of no matter what happens.</p>
</details>

所以医护人员告诉他：“你需要紧急医疗救助。”他去医院了吗？他听从了那个建议吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the medic tells him, "You need urgent medical attention. Does he go to a hospital? Does he heed that advice?"</p>

乔尔选择不乘坐救护车。相反，他由公司老板史蒂夫开车送走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Joel opts not to take an ambulance. He instead is driven by Steve, the owner of the company.</p>

“在我看来，我要去医院，对吧？所以，但是……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in my opinion, I'm going to the hospital, right? So, but</p>

<p class="english-text">he thinks that Steve is going to take him to the hospital. That's sort of the protocol for a moment like that.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. Instead, he was driven 90 minutes back from the fire line. And then he's surprised because Steve drops him off at his dad's house. It's almost midnight at this point. He looks drawn. He looks weak.</p>

“你当时问我这个人是什么颜色，我可能都不知道。我当时就是这么糟糕。你知道，我的身体正在崩溃。”

<p class="english-text">I drove to the hospital thinking that he's going to die at any moment. I knew it.</p>

在医院里，医生开始进行检查，经过几天的检查，乔尔变得越来越虚弱。此时，他甚至无法真正走过走廊。最终，他们带着一个出人意料的答案回来了。他被诊断出患有**急性髓性白血病**（Acute Myeloid Leukemia: 一种侵袭性血癌），这是一种侵袭性血癌，最常见于六七十岁的人群。而不是乔尔这个年纪的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, at the hospital, doctors start running tests and it takes a few days of tests and Joel is getting weaker and weaker. At this point, he can't even really walk down the hallway. And eventually, they come back with an answer that nobody expects. He is diagnosed with acute myoid leukemia, which is an aggressive blood cancer that is most often seen in people in their 60s and 70s. Not somebody Joel's age.</p>
</details>

他当时多大年纪？他被诊断出患病时，离他25岁生日只差一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how old was he at that point? He is diagnosed the day before he turns 25.</p>

“但这不是真的，你知道。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it's not. You know,</p>
</details>

他需要立即进行化疗，立即输血。他腿上蔓延的皮疹原来是他的血液在没有治疗的情况下基本上崩溃了。如果得不到治疗，他可能在几周内死亡。事实是，即使有医疗干预，这种癌症的患者也只有大约一半能活过一年。但乔尔这些天只想着如何尽快完成治疗，然后回去扑火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">he needs immediate chemotherapy, immediate blood transfusions. That rash that was creeping up his legs turns out to have been his blood basically just breaking down without treatment. He could die within a matter of weeks. And the truth is, even with medical interventions, only about half of patients with this kind of cancer survive a year. But all Joel is thinking about in these days is how quickly he can get through treatment and get back to fighting fires.</p>
</details>

“所以我真的很兴奋，伙计，能和那支队伍一起回去。我被那支队伍锁定了，那是一支好队伍。他们比其他任何队伍工作的时间都长，你知道。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I was really excited, man, to go back with that crew. I was locked in with that crew, but it was a good crew. They got the most hours out of any of the crews, you know.</p>
</details>

他有点不明白情况有多严重，他面临着死亡的危险，他只是专注于他以为在他面前的生活。听起来他几乎无法接受身体实际发生的事情的现实。是的。我的意思是，这对他来说太令人震惊了，他无法真正处理正在发生的事情。但对他父亲来说，现实非常清楚。他回想起第一天，他送乔尔去，史蒂夫说会照顾他的儿子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's sort of not understanding how serious the situation is, how in danger he is of dying, and he's just focused on this life that he thought was in front of him. It sounds like he almost couldn't accept the reality of what was actually happening to his body. Yes. I mean, it's so jarring for him, like he just can't really process what's going on. But for his father, the reality was very clear. And he was thinking back to that first day when he dropped off Joel and Steve said that he would take care of his son.</p>
</details>

“他被同一个人送到我家门口，那个人在不到七年前告诉我，‘嘿，我们会照顾他的。’”

就史蒂夫而言，他说他明白这对乔尔来说将是一个漫长的诊断过程。这不会是一件很快的事情，他试图通过让乔尔在家休息，然后第二天去医院来帮乔尔一个忙。但马特就是无法忘记那一刻，看到自己的孩子濒临死亡，却被带回家而不是去接受医疗救治的噩梦时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For his part, Steve says that he understood that this was going to be a long diagnostic process for Joel. it wasn't going to be a quick thing and he was trying to do Joel a favor by letting him rest at home and then go into the hospital the next day. But Matt just cannot get over that moment, that nightmare moment of seeing your child. He felt like on death store and they're being taken to your house instead of taken to get medical care.</p>
</details>

“他们让他拖延在那里，面瘫，流口水，所有这些事情都在发生。他无法控制自己的肌肉，疼痛。他当时情况很不好。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They let him linger out there having facial paralysis, drooling, and all this stuff going on. He had no control over his muscles, pain. He wasn't okay.</p>
</details>

发生在他身上的事情，可能发生在任何**私人消防公司**（Private Firefighting Company: 为政府提供消防服务的私人企业）。无论他为谁工作，他可能都会在浓烟中没有戴口罩，最终可能在医院里患上癌症，处于这种完全相同的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what happened to him really could have happened at any private firefighting company. No matter who he worked for, he would probably have been out there without a mask in heavy smoke and he might have ended up in this exact situation at the hospital sick with cancer.</p>
</details>

### 否认的文化与制度性漏洞

但我认为，对马特以及最终对乔尔来说，他们非常执着于他被送下车的地方和时间这些具体细节，因为他们觉得乔尔就像是被“抛弃”了，好像他一直都是一个可随意处置的工人。所以他们感到非常愤怒。与此同时，所有的医疗账单开始涌入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think that for Matt and eventually for Joel, they got really fixated on these specifics of where he got dropped off, what time it was because they felt like Joel was just sort of dumped, like he had been a disposable worker all along. And so they felt really mad. And meanwhile, all of these medical bills started to come in.</p>
</details>

“我当时在支付第一笔医院账单。我没有保险。我当时是自掏腰包支付的，对吧？”他和马特觉得Pacific Oasis应该对此负责，因为他在他们的监管下生病了。当员工在工作中生病时，**工伤赔偿**（Workers' Compensation: 员工在工作中受伤或生病时获得的赔偿）会涵盖工资损失和医院账单等费用。所以乔尔和马特决定提出工伤赔偿申请。他们去了Pacific Oasis，史蒂夫把他们叫进一个房间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was paying that first hospital bill. I didn't have insurance. I was paying that [ __ ] out of my pocket, right? He and Matt felt like Pacific Oasis should be held accountable since he had gotten sick on their watch. And workers compensation covers things like lost wages and hospital bills when employees get sick on the job. So Joel and Matt decide they are going to file a workers compensation claim. They go down to Pacific Oasis and Steve pulls them into a room</p>
</details>

“房间里，他说你们不可能证明这与工作有关。我说什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">room and said there's no way you guys can prove this is workrelated. And I said what?</p>

他基本上说任何事情都可能导致这种情况。我们正在尽力。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He basically said anything could have caused this. trying our best.</p>
</details>

“我们的工伤赔偿政策不会支付这笔费用。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our workers compensation policy is not going to pay for this.</p>
</details>

“我不是想证明什么。我只是想说这发生在他扑火的时候。让我们现在就给他报销，直到我们弄清楚。你懂我的意思吗？”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to say that this happened to him on a fire. Let's get him covered right now until we can figure this out. You know what I mean?</p>
</details>

但他们还是提出了申请。最终，工伤保险公司拒绝了他们的申请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they filed the claim anyway. And ultimately, the workers comp insurer denies their claim.</p>
</details>

“所以，我基本上就是自掏腰包。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I was just using money out of out of pocket basically.</p>
</details>

哦，是的。

<p class="english-text">Oh, yeah.</p>
</details>

自掏腰包。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Out of pocket.</p>
</details>

他们为什么无法证明这种联系？几乎不可能证明任何个体癌症病例是由野火烟雾引起的。这在某种程度上保护了整个消防行业免于承担责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why couldn't they prove this link? It's almost impossible to prove that any individual cancer case comes from wildfire smoke. And that sort of shields the whole firefighting industry from responsibility.</p>
</details>

在林业局工作的人告诉我，这是消防员历史上没有得到口罩的一个原因，因为如果你给某人一个口罩，这本质上是承认烟雾是有风险的，可能会导致某种长期疾病。我们不会给你一个可以保护你的口罩，因为那将是承认你在这项工作中处于危险之中。所以，我们只会让你不受保护。这是举报人一直告诉我的，即围绕烟雾危险性存在一种否认文化，因为一旦你承认了，你该怎么办？你必须真正改变扑火的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People who work at the Forest Service have told me that this is one reason that firefighters historically have not been provided with masks because if you give somebody a mask, it's essentially acknowledging that smoke is risky and could cause some sort of long-term illness. We're not going to give you a mask that could protect you because that would be an admission that you are in danger doing this work. So therefore, we were going to leave you unprotected. This is what whistleblowers have been telling me that there's just sort of been this culture of denial around how dangerous smoke is because what do you do once you acknowledge that you have to really change how fires are fought?</p>
</details>

政府可能不得不开始提供更多人手，以便人们可以从烟雾中休息。然后他们可能不得不开始涵盖这一系列健康状况。好的。所以雇主不承认工作与疾病之间存在联系。但是工作与乔尔所患的癌症类型之间是否存在联系呢？我们对此确切知道些什么？直到1980年代，人们都认为野火烟雾基本上是无害的，就像篝火一样。但从那时起，大量研究明确表明野火烟雾与心血管问题、肺部问题以及至少12种癌症有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government might start to have to provide more staffing so that people could take breaks from smoke. Then they might have to start covering this whole range of health conditions. Okay. So the employers don't acknowledge a link between the work and the illness here. But is there a link between the work and the type of cancer that Joel got? Like what do we know about that for sure? So until the 1980s, people thought that wildfire smoke was basically benign like a campfire. But since then, there's been a lot of research that has shown pretty definitively that wildfire smoke is linked to cardiovascular issues, lung issues, and at least 12 kinds of cancers.</p>
</details>

因此，为了回应这一日益增长的研究成果，国会实际上在2022年强制**林业局**（Forest Service: 美国农业部下属机构，负责管理国家森林和草原）开始为与烟雾暴露最密切相关的十几种癌症提供**工伤赔偿**（Workers' Compensation: 员工在工作中受伤或生病时获得的赔偿）福利。但对于为林业局合同工作但受雇于私人公司的另一大批消防员来说，情况并非如此。所以基本上，如果你直接为联邦政府扑火，你将获得保障。但如果你为一家为林业局工作的私人公司工作，你将不会获得保障。没错。所以如果你有像乔尔这样的职业生涯，然后你患上了白血病，并且你为林业局工作，你现在就不必证明你的癌症从何而来。它被假定来自你在火灾中的工作，因为两者之间有如此强的联系。但对乔尔来说，他必须证明他的癌症从何而来，这几乎是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, responding to this growing body of research, in 2022, Congress actually forced the Forest Service to start offering workers compensation benefits for a list of more than a dozen cancers that are most strongly associated with smoke exposure. But that's not how it works for this large group of other firefighters working on contract for the Forest Service, but working for private companies. So basically, if you work directly for the federal government fighting fires, you will get coverage. But if you work for a private company that works for the Forest Service, you will not get coverage. Exactly. So if you've had, you know, Joel's career and then you develop leukemia and you're working for the Forest Service, you now don't have to prove where your cancer came from. It's just assumed that it came from your work on fires because there's such a strong link. But for Joel, he would have to prove where his cancer came from, which is almost impossible.</p>
</details>

所以基本上，对于像乔尔这样的人来说，听起来他完全需要自己承担治疗费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically, for somebody like Joel, he is completely on his own, it sounds like, to cover the cost of his treatment.</p>
</details>

是的。正如你所想象的，费用极其昂贵。这个家庭基本上花光了所有积蓄来支付这笔费用。乔尔在这一切中过得怎么样？治疗有效吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And as you can imagine, it was extremely expensive. The family spent basically everything they had trying to pay for this. And how was Joel doing through all of this? Was the treatment working?</p>
</details>

化疗开始对抗癌症，但这给乔尔带来了巨大的身体消耗。他几乎无法动弹。他一直疼痛。他只能手脚并用地爬到阁楼卧室。然而到了冬天，他开始好转。他的癌症进入了缓解期，他开始恢复了一些体力。他和他父亲一起出去尝试像以前一样徒步。起初他只能迈出蹒跚的步伐，但渐渐地，他能够恢复一些以前的状态。听起来他战胜了困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The chemotherapy starts to fight back the cancer, but it takes a tremendous physical toll on Joel. He could barely move. He was in pain all the time. He would crawl up to his attic bedroom on hands and knees. By the winter though, he started to get better. His cancer went into remission and he started recovering a little bit of strength. He went out with his father to try to go on a hike like he used to do with him. And at first he could only take these sort of stuttering steps, but little by little he was able to recover a little bit of of who he had been. It sounds like he beat the odds.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，他进入了缓解期。他的医生非常谨慎地解释说，癌症随时可能复发，而且通常会复发。如果复发，化疗将不足以应对。他将不得不进行骨髓移植。但在乔尔春天得到医生许可后，他又回到了高中毕业后的那种漫无目的的状态。他不知道该做什么。他感到迷茫，思绪开始飘回到扑火。他开始幻想，如果我回去那里会怎样？他想回到火线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, he went into remission. His doctors were very careful to explain that the cancer could come back at any time, and it often does. And if it did come back, chemotherapy wouldn't be enough. He would have to have a bone marrow transplant. But after Joel got the sign off from his doctors in the spring, he sort of went back to that place of aimlessness that he had been in after graduating high school. He didn't quite know what to do. He felt a drift and his mind started drifting back to fighting fires. He started sort of fantasizing about, well, like what if I went back there? He wanted to go back to the line.</p>
</details>

### 绝望中的坚持与未来的挑战

他想回到火线。那里有他的朋友。这是一种赚钱还债的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He wanted to go back to the line. It's where his friends are. It's a way to start making money to pay off his debts.</p>
</details>

乔尔非常执着于他扑灭的最后一场火灾，以及他如何生病而无法继续工作。他真的把那看作是一次失败。在很多方面，他说他想通过回到火线来“救赎”自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Joel is very hung up on that last fire that he fought and how he got sick and he wasn't able to to keep going. He really sees that as a defeat. And in a lot of ways, he says he wants to redeem himself by getting back out on the fire line.</p>

他实际上去找史蒂夫要回工作，史蒂夫告诉他：“你疯了吗？你认为消防工作让你得了这种癌症。你还要回去？那不是在玩火吗？”所以史蒂夫不会雇佣他。他在当地找不到工作。所以他买了一张去阿拉斯加的机票，那里有更多的联邦野外消防工作。

<p class="english-text">He actually went and asked Steve for his job back and Steve told him, "Are you crazy? You're think that firefighting gave you this cancer. You're going to go back. Isn't that tempting fate?" So Steve wouldn't hire him. He couldn't get a job locally. So he bought a ticket to go to Alaska where there are a lot more federal wildland firefighting jobs.</p>

哇。马特非常希望乔尔做任何除了消防以外的工作。但他同时也知道，如果他逼得太紧，可能会疏远乔尔。所以他走在一条非常微妙的线上。

<p class="english-text">Wow. And Matt desperately wants Joel to do any kind of work besides firefighting. But he also knows that if he pushes too hard, he could alienate Joel. So he's walking this really fine line.</p>

他这种癌症非常具有侵袭性。预后并不乐观。在他看来，他很可能仍然会死于这种癌症。

他觉得他现在所做的一切都像是“借来的时间”。如果他最终在20多岁时死去，他只想继续下去，继续做那个坚强的消防员。

这真的让我感到，总会有像乔尔这样的人。总会有需要这种工作、想要做这种工作的人，以及一个需要像乔尔这样的人的行业，对吧？这是真的。有成千上万的野外消防员。

<p class="english-text">It really strikes me that there will always be a Joel. There will always be people who need this kind of work, who want to do this kind of work, and an industry that needs Joles, right? It's true. There are tens of thousands of wildland firefighters.</p>

随着野火季节变得越来越长，火灾越来越猛烈，政府正日益转向像乔尔这样的消防员，人们年轻时就投身这项工作。他们真的想做。而当他们生病时，这个行业就会继续前进，总会有另一个年轻人来取代他们。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And as wildfire season grows longer and the fires grow more intense, the government is increasingly turning to firefighters like Joel and people get into this work young. They really want to do it. And when they get sick, the industry just sort of moves on and there's always going to be another young person to come and replace them.</p>

### 政策转变与未竟的保障

汉娜发表这系列调查报道的第一篇文章后不久，国会举行了监督听证会，引用了她的报道，并向该机构施压要求做出改变。不久之后，该机构确实做出了改变，推翻了其长达数十年的口罩禁令，并宣布将向所有消防员提供口罩，并鼓励他们使用。目前尚未宣布将**工伤赔偿**（Workers' Compensation: 员工在工作中受伤或生病时获得的赔偿）范围扩大到合同制消防员的计划。

<p class="english-text">Not long after Hannah published the first story in this investigative series, Congress held oversight hearings citing her reporting and pressured the agency to make changes. and soon after it did, reversing its decadesl long ban on masks and announcing it will provide masks to all of its firefighters and encourage them to use them. No plans have been announced to extend worker compensation coverage to contract firefighters.</p>

### 其他新闻：飓风梅丽莎

以下是您还需要知道的其他新闻。今天，牙买加总理安德鲁·霍尔斯（Andrew Holes）下令强制疏散，并发布了严峻的安全警告，因为“梅丽莎”飓风（Hurricane Melissa）正以175英里/小时的风速和足以带来近3英尺降雨的水汽，于周一向他的国家及其280万人民袭来。预计周一晚间，牙买加将出现危险的大风、灾难性的洪水和高达13英尺的风暴潮，远在飓风预计于周二早上登陆之前。
