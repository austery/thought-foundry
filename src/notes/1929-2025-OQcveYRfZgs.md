### 新书《1929》引发的讨论

Jason: Hey, Sorcin. I just went through the comments. The one question keeps coming up over again. "Why the are you writing this book? Jesus Christ. What a party pooper."

Jason: 嘿，索尔金。我刚刚看了一下评论，有一个问题反复出现：“你他妈为什么要写这本书？天哪，真是个扫兴鬼。”

Andrew: What a party pooper. I don't know, man. I don't think I think it's supposed to be like a beach read.

Andrew: 真是个扫兴鬼。我不知道，伙计。我不觉得，我觉得这本书应该像一本海滩读物。

Jason: A beach read?

Jason: 海滩读物？

Andrew: Yes.

Andrew: 是的。

Jason: Come on. Did you read it?

Jason: 拜托。你读了吗？

Jason: My god. No. I saw the title. I was like, skip.

Jason: 我的天啊。没有。我看到标题就想跳过。

Jason: All right, besties. I think that was another epic discussion. People love the interviews. I could hear him talk for hours. Absolutely.

Jason: 好了，朋友们。我认为那又是一次精彩的讨论。人们喜欢这些访谈。我能听他讲好几个小时。绝对的。

Chamath: We crush your questions a minute. We are giving people ground truth data to underwrite your own opinion. What do you guys think? That was fun. Palimat, you're going to love these characters. I kid you not. The people who are involved in this at that time, like the main character.

Chamath: 我们会迅速解答你们的问题。我们正在提供事实数据，以便你们形成自己的观点。你们觉得呢？很有趣。帕利马特，你会喜欢这些人物的，我没跟你开玩笑。当时参与其中的人，比如主角。

David: I totally agree with you. I am a huge fan, to be honest. I've studied this period for a while actually. I think it's great that you wrote this book. I think it's incredibly fascinating. We're here with Andrew Ross Sorkin, Chamath, and I with another All-In interview, riveting. Today we're going to talk about Andrew's new book, "1929," and specifically cover why Andrew got into it, what the history teaches us, and are we looking at another 1929 or something different in this day and age, as a lot of people may speculate. But Andrew, thanks for joining Chamath and I to talk about this.

David: 我完全同意你的看法。说实话，我是一个忠实粉丝。我实际上研究这个时期有一段时间了。我觉得你写这本书很棒。它非常引人入胜。今天我们和Andrew Ross Sorkin、Chamath一起进行另一次All-In访谈，非常精彩。今天我们将讨论Andrew的新书《1929》，具体探讨Andrew为何涉足这个题材，历史给我们带来了什么教训，以及我们是否正面临另一个1929年，或者在这个时代有什么不同，正如许多人可能猜测的那样。Andrew，感谢你和Chamath一起讨论这个话题。

Andrew: Thank you for having me, and I love your background there. A true image of what was actually happening in October of 1929, crazily enough.

Andrew: 谢谢你们邀请我，我喜欢你们的背景图。它真实地展现了1929年10月实际发生的事情，这很疯狂。

David: That's right. And it was colorized by some AI or something, I think. But, uh, yeah. Great. How and why did you get into this era of 1929, the great stock market crash of 1929? You're a busy guy. You're on TV every day. We see you all over. You're at conferences. I saw you at a conference in Southern California this week. Then you're at another conference and you're back in New York. You're very busy. At what point did you say, "Hey, I want to sit down and write a book about this era?"

David: 没错。我想那幅图是某个AI上色的。嗯，是的。很好。你是如何以及为何进入1929年这个时代，也就是1929年大股灾的研究的？你是个大忙人。你每天都上电视。我们到处都能看到你。你参加各种会议。我这周在南加州的一个会议上看到了你。然后你又去了另一个会议，又回到了纽约。你非常忙。在哪个时候你决定：“嘿，我想坐下来写一本关于这个时代书？”

### 写作《1929》的缘由与灵感

Andrew: Okay, so here's what happened to me. So, I had written that book, "Too Big to Fail," about the 2008 financial crisis. And people used to always say to me after that, they'd get into these very in-depth conversations about 1929, or they'd want to know more about 1929. And most people know that something terrible happened in 1929. They know there was a crash in 1929. They oftentimes think it is the Great Depression or leads to the Great Depression. But if you were to ever ask most people now, Chamath, and you are maybe in a different category, and say, "Well, who were the people who actually were engaged in this? What were they saying to each other? Who was sleeping with who? Who was trying to over who? What was actually happening here, and what were the incentives and what were the motivations that led to what clearly were some poor decisions?" I couldn't find that.

Andrew: 好的，事情是这样的。我写过那本书《**大而不倒** (Too Big to Fail: 一本关于2008年金融危机的书)》，是关于2008年金融危机的。在那之后，人们总是对我说，他们会深入探讨1929年，或者他们想了解更多关于1929年的事情。大多数人都知道1929年发生了一些可怕的事情。他们知道1929年发生了一次崩盘。他们常常认为那是大萧条，或者导致了大萧条。但是，如果你现在去问大多数人——Chamath，你可能属于不同的类别——问：“那么，实际参与其中的人是谁？他们互相说了些什么？谁和谁有关系？谁想超越谁？这里到底发生了什么？以及导致那些明显是糟糕决定的动机和诱因是什么？”我找不到这些信息。

Andrew: So, I went on a vacation like 10 years ago with my wife, very nerdy, and I downloaded all these books to my Kindle. And there are some great books, by the way, about this period, don't get me wrong, but they didn't have the sort of character-driven story. Like, I loved "Den of Thieves," I loved "Barbarians of the Gate." I loved stories about people.

Andrew: 所以，大约十年前，我和妻子去度假，我非常书呆子气地把所有这些书都下载到我的Kindle里。顺便说一句，关于这个时期有很多很棒的书，别误会，但它们没有那种以人物为驱动的故事。比如，我喜欢《**贼巢** (Den of Thieves: 一本关于80年代华尔街内幕交易的书)》，我喜欢《**门口的野蛮人** (Barbarians of the Gate: 一本关于KKR收购RJR Nabisco的书)》。我喜欢关于人的故事。

Jason: Fabulous books. Fabulous books.

Jason: 精彩的书。精彩的书。

David: What did your wife think when you ignored her the entire vacation you guys were on, just reading books on your Kindle?

David: 你妻子有什么想法？你们度假的时候，你全程都在玩Kindle看书，完全忽略了她。

Andrew: I mean, I think she thought I was out of my mind, but, um, no. So, I read these books, and I was like, "Okay, where's the story? Where are the people?"

Andrew: 我想她觉得我疯了，但是，嗯，没有。我读了这些书，然后我就想：“好吧，故事在哪里？人物在哪里？”

### 1929年大崩盘的经济背景

Chamath: Before you get to the people, can you give people a concise, like I was going to ask you for a TikTok of the overarching economic issues before we get to the sort of the characters, because I think, yeah. Because I think, to your point, which is an important one, people think it was like, "Okay, stocks went down," right? But the other things, like the overproduction of the economy, tightening interest rates, the war debt, all of this stuff was just commingled, and nobody fully understands that. Can you maybe give folks a precise representation of the setup?

Chamath: 在你讲到人物之前，你能否先给大家一个简明扼要的、就像TikTok短视频一样的概述，讲讲当时主要的经济问题，然后再讲人物？因为我认为，是的，正如你所说，这是一个重要的观点，人们以为那只是“股票跌了”，对吧？但其他因素，比如经济的过度生产、收紧的利率、战争债务，所有这些都交织在一起，没有人完全理解。你能否给大家精确地描述一下当时的背景？

Andrew: The setup. Okay. So, so let's just go back even, let's go back to 1919 because actually I think that's a critical year. So prior to 1919 in America, people did not really borrow money. It was like a moral sin to get credit. Like people didn't do it.

Andrew: 背景。好的。那么，我们甚至可以追溯到1919年，因为我真的认为那是一个关键的年份。在1919年之前的美国，人们其实并不真正借钱。获得信贷就像是一种道德上的罪恶。人们不会那么做。

Andrew: In 1919, General Motors says, "You know what? We're going to start lending people money so that you can buy a car." And that was actually like a major inflection point in America.

Andrew: 1919年，通用汽车说：“你知道吗？我们要开始向人们贷款，这样你们就能买车了。”那实际上是美国的一个重要转折点。

Andrew: Because then Sears Roebuck clocks what's going on and says, "Okay, we're going to do this too for appliances." And then a guy named Charlie Mitchell, who ran a bank called National City, which becomes Citigroup, says, "You know what? We can do this for stocks." So, and all of a sudden, brokerage houses are opening up on the corners of streets the way we see Starbucks today. It's literally like that. And you could go into one of these places and you could put a buck down and they would literally loan you $10 off of your dollar. I mean, that's how insane things were. And there was no risk underwriting of any kind.

Andrew: 因为西尔斯·罗巴克百货公司看到了情况，然后说：“好吧，我们也要为家电做这件事。”然后一个叫查理·米切尔的人，他经营着一家叫国民城市银行（后来成为花旗集团）的银行，他说：“你知道吗？我们可以把这套用到股票上。”于是，突然间，券商像我们今天看到星巴克一样，在街角开店。简直就是那样。你可以走进这些地方，放下一美元，他们就会真的借给你10美元。我的意思是，当时的情况就是这么疯狂。而且没有任何形式的风险承销。

Chamath: Zero risk underwriting.

Chamath: 零风险承销。

Andrew: But nobody understood what they were. By the way, there's no **SEC** (Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会). There's no regulations. Somebody who read this book early said, "Oh, in your research, did you get a chance to read any of the prospectuses for the companies?" I was like, "Prospectuses? Like, if there was like a leaflet that they handed out on the street, you'd be lucky." So there's no, there's nothing.

Andrew: 但没人明白它们是什么。顺便说一句，当时没有**SEC** (Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会)，也没有任何监管。一个早期读过这本书的人说：“哦，在你的研究中，你有没有机会读到这些公司的招股说明书？”我当时想：“招股说明书？如果他们能在街上发传单，你就很幸运了。”所以什么都没有。

Andrew: And it's just like a complete go-go era. Forget about 1929. In 1928, the stock market went up 48%. So, people are just, there's just sort of like this, it's a little bit of the Chuck Prince, when the music's playing, you're dancing, and everybody's dancing, and nobody's even thinking about the music stopping, kind of like ever.

Andrew: 那就是一个完全的狂飙时代。别提1929年了，1928年股市上涨了48%。所以人们就是这样，有点像**查克·普林斯** (Chuck Prince: 花旗集团前CEO，曾说“只要音乐不停，我们就会继续跳舞”)所说的那样，音乐响起时，你就会跳舞，每个人都在跳舞，没有人会去想音乐会停止，就好像永远不会停止一样。

Andrew: Now, meanwhile, there are also these technological changes. I mean, huge generational technological changes. In the same way, I think we're probably talking about like AI today, radio. So **RCA** (Radio Corporation of America: 美国无线电公司) was like the **Nvidia** (NVIDIA Corporation: 美国的图形处理器和人工智能芯片公司) of its time. Everybody wanted into RCA. The stock ticker was radio because it was like going to change the world. And the other big piece of this was also similar to today, this idea of democratizing finance. It was like, "Okay, the elites have had their way. They've made all the money. We're now going to let everybody in on the action."

Andrew: 同时，还有这些技术变革。我的意思是，巨大的、代际性的技术变革。就像今天我们可能谈论人工智能一样，当时是广播。所以**RCA** (Radio Corporation of America: 美国无线电公司)就像是那个时代的**英伟达** (NVIDIA Corporation: 美国的图形处理器和人工智能芯片公司)。每个人都想投资RCA。股票代码就是“无线电”，因为它仿佛要改变世界。而这其中的另一个重要部分，也与今天类似，就是金融民主化的理念。当时的想法是：“好吧，精英们已经得逞了。他们赚了所有的钱。现在我们要让每个人都参与进来。”

Andrew: Now, the difference between then and now, though, was there was also like crazy amounts of manipulation, insider trading. As I said, there were no rules. Like literally no rules. Nobody's going to jail for this stuff because there wasn't a rule against it.

Andrew: 然而，当时和现在不同的是，当时还有大量的操纵和**内幕交易** (Insider Trading: 利用未公开信息进行证券交易)。就像我说的，没有规则。简直就是没有规则。没有人会因为这些事情进监狱，因为当时没有禁止这些行为的规定。

Chamath: By the way, it wasn't just individuals that were investing and overextended with margin, but the banks would take depositors' money and they were going long the stock market.

Chamath: 顺便说一句，不仅仅是个人在投资并过度使用**保证金** (Margin: 借钱购买证券)。银行也会拿储户的钱去做多股市。

Andrew: The banks were doing it. By the way, not only the banks, regular old corporations. I mean, could you imagine if it turned out that like JP Morgan and Goldman was going long in video with depositor funds? That's the effective equivalent of what was happening back then, too.

Andrew: 银行也在做。顺便说一句，不仅是银行，普通的旧公司也在做。我的意思是，你能想象如果摩根大通和高盛用储户的资金做多视频股票会怎样吗？那基本上就相当于当时发生的事情。

David: You had corporations taking their balance sheet, and effectively then loaning it out so that people could go buy stocks. That was the other thing that was happening.

David: 公司会动用它们的资产负债表，然后有效地把钱借出去，这样人们就可以去买股票。这也是当时发生的事情。

Andrew: There's a sort of like just the push towards investing and overproduction and all sorts of other things created this sort of frothy market. And you had a Fed. You mentioned the Fed, which is an interesting part of this. There was a Fed. It was new. Started in 1913. They knew this was a mess. Like they kept saying to themselves, you read all the diaries and notes that I was in for the last eight years. They knew there was a problem. But they were scared out of their mind about doing what they probably should have done, which was raise interest rates, but they couldn't pull off like a **Volcker** (Paul Volcker: 美联储前主席，以大幅提高利率对抗通胀闻名) kind of thing.

Andrew: 各种因素，比如投资的推动、过度生产以及其他种种，共同创造了一个泡沫市场。而且当时有美联储。你提到了美联储，这是其中一个有趣的部分。当时有美联储，它很新，成立于1913年。他们知道这是一团糟。就像他们一直对自己说的那样，我过去八年里读过的所有日记和笔记都显示，他们知道有问题。但他们非常害怕去做他们可能应该做的事情，那就是提高利率，但他们无法像**沃尔克** (Paul Volcker: 美联储前主席，以大幅提高利率对抗通胀闻名)那样果断行动。

### 金融民主化与社会传染效应

Chamath: Can you sorry, but can you double click into what you said about the fact that there was a social contagion around wealth creation that people felt like the elites had had their way and now it was everybody else's turn. Just describe that like what had caused that and what amplified that social contagion and who and who was everyone else? Were these factory workers because we're kind of on the heels of a big industrial buildout. So like was it the folks who had savings for the first time like where's this coming from?

Chamath: 抱歉，你能否详细说明一下你提到的关于财富创造的社会传染现象？人们觉得精英们已经得逞了，现在轮到其他人了。请描述一下是什么导致了这种现象，又是什么放大了这种社会传染？“其他人”指的是谁？是工厂工人吗？因为我们正处于大规模工业建设的后期。那么是那些第一次有储蓄的人吗？这股风潮是从哪里来的？

Andrew: Well, so what's really happening is you have a lot of folks who are coming from farms, frankly, and moving to the big cities for the first time. That's a huge part of what's happening. So most of the trading, I should say, is happening in the big cities. It's not happening out in small towns. It's happening in big cities for the most part. But that whole scenario, once they're in the big city and they're seeing that there's sort of this wealthy group of people, talk about inequality, this wealthy group of people, and they want in on the action. And also, by the way, the people at the top, meaning the bankers and investors and entrepreneurs, are like, "We think there's this big opportunity to open this up for the little guy or the ordinary investor. We think this is like a huge opportunity."

Andrew: 嗯，所以实际情况是，很多人坦率地说，是从农场来到大城市，这是他们第一次进城。这是当时发生的一个重要部分。所以，我想说，大部分交易都发生在大城市。它没有发生在小城镇。大部分发生在大城市。但是，当他们进入大城市，看到那里有一群富裕的人——谈到不平等，这群富裕的人——他们也想参与进来。而且，顺便说一句，那些处于顶层的人，也就是银行家、投资者和企业家们，他们觉得：“我们认为这是一个巨大的机会，可以向小人物或普通投资者开放。我们认为这是一个巨大的机会。”

Andrew: There was a guy named John Raskob, who's sort of like the Elon Musk of his era. He actually ran General Motors, created the credit program there, then becomes hugely wealthy, then gets into politics, by the way, ends up building the Empire State Building. But he was trying to create almost like the first mutual fund, because he thought that people should be able to get in on the action the way he did. That was like his whole conceit. And he talked about it pretty openly. There was a famous article called "Everybody Ought to Be Rich." That was his line. "Everybody ought to be rich." And it also was a time where the American dream shifted a little bit, I think, from sort of a **Horatio Alger** (Horatio Alger: 美国19世纪作家，其作品常描绘通过努力实现“白手起家”的美国梦) story a little bit to like a lottery, "Can we get rich?" Like, can the whole idea of capitalism give us this great opportunity?

Andrew: 有一个人叫约翰·拉斯科布，他有点像那个时代的埃隆·马斯克。他实际上经营着通用汽车，在那里创建了信贷计划，然后变得非常富有，顺便说一句，后来还进入政界，最终建造了帝国大厦。但他当时正试图创建几乎是第一个共同基金，因为他认为人们应该能够像他一样参与进来。这就是他的全部想法。他相当公开地谈论过这件事。有一篇著名的文章叫做《每个人都应该富有》。那是他的名言：“每个人都应该富有。”而且那也是一个美国梦发生了一些转变的时期，我认为，从某种**霍雷肖·阿尔杰** (Horatio Alger: 美国19世纪作家，其作品常描绘通过努力实现“白手起家”的美国梦)式的“白手起家”故事，变成了一种类似彩票的“我们能一夜暴富吗？”的想法。就像，资本主义的整个理念能否给我们带来这个巨大的机会？

David: And I, you know, obviously we're today. Do you think that radio played a role in that because it amplified these stories and made them go faster, and people would just start to tell these tales, and folks started to forget the Horatio Alger part? Like, I'm just still trying to understand like, you have folks on the farms, right? They're getting educated. The industrial revolution is happening. So they're moving to the city. And the radio then is maybe what Instagram is like now. You're seeing people with wealth. You're seeing this wealth that you don't have. You aspire to that.

David: 嗯，你知道，我们现在身处这个时代。你认为广播在其中扮演了角色吗？因为它放大了这些故事，让它们传播得更快，人们会开始讲这些故事，然后人们开始忘记霍雷肖·阿尔杰那部分？我只是仍然想理解，比如，农场里的人，对吧？他们正在接受教育。工业革命正在发生。所以他们搬到了城市。而那时的广播可能就像现在的Instagram。你看到了有钱人。你看到了你没有的财富。你渴望那种生活。

Andrew: Yes. And then something comes in and fills the void.

Andrew: 是的。然后某种东西出现并填补了空白。

David: Is that is that kind of the mechanic?

David: 这就是那种机制吗？

Andrew: I think something fills the void, and all of a sudden, you now have the opportunity because the bank or the brokerage houses are going to lend you all this money. And it's not just radio being the communication device. It's really the media. So the other thing that was happening during this period, so Time magazine starts in 1923, Forbes 1917. All of a sudden, Charlie Mitchell, the CEOs, are now on the cover of magazines the way Babe Ruth and Charles Lindbergh had been on the cover. So, sort of the shift in how people even thought about business. None of these guys were famous before the 1920s, but they became famous, and everybody wanted, everybody wanted to be them.

Andrew: 我认为某种东西填补了空白，然后突然间，你有了机会，因为银行或券商会借给你所有这些钱。而且不仅仅是广播作为通讯工具。它实际上是媒体。所以在这个时期发生的另一件事是，《时代》杂志于1923年创刊，《福布斯》于1917年创刊。突然间，查理·米切尔和那些首席执行官们登上了杂志封面，就像贝比·鲁斯和查尔斯·林德伯格曾经登上封面一样。所以，人们对商业的看法也发生了一些转变。这些人在1920年代之前都不出名，但他们变得有名，每个人都想，每个人都想成为他们。

David: This was what America was about, was this industrialization, right? And this was kind of like, "Hey, we're pioneering an entirely new world, and these are the leaders doing it, and these are the rock stars that are transforming this country." Was that kind of a big part of what was going on at the time?

David: 这就是当时的美国，就是工业化，对吧？这有点像是，“嘿，我们正在开创一个全新的世界，这些是引领者，这些是正在改变这个国家的摇滚明星。”这在当时是不是很大一部分情况？

Andrew: Totally. And everybody wanted to be, everybody wanted to be a rockstar. By the way, it's the same way everybody wants to be you, David, or everybody wants to be Chamath, or they all want to be Elon. Like, I think there was a huge thing like, "Okay, and here's this opportunity." And they were being sold the opportunity and given the opportunity not just to invest, but again, I think that the margin piece of it was such a crucial, crucial element.

Andrew: 完全正确。每个人都想成为，每个人都想成为摇滚明星。顺便说一句，这就像每个人都想成为你，David，或者每个人都想成为Chamath，或者他们都想成为埃隆一样。我认为当时有一个巨大的想法，就是“好吧，这是一个机会。”他们被推销这个机会，并获得了这个机会，不仅仅是投资，而且再次强调，我认为其中的保证金部分是一个非常非常关键的因素。

### 历史的相似性与监管的演变

David: Do you think it's a coincidence, Andrew, that now you're publishing this book in 2025, but like how does it feel like eerily similar to you? Like way too similar where you can almost map one to one those boundary conditions then in some version of that today? Is that what?

David: Andrew，你觉得你现在在2025年出版这本书是个巧合吗？但你觉得它和你感觉到的可怕的相似之处在哪里？是不是太相似了，以至于你几乎可以把当时的边界条件和今天某种情况一一对应起来？是这样吗？

Andrew: Like a little bit, but not, I will say that wasn't my intent. Like when I got involved in this, I just wanted to retell the story and figure out who these guys were. I ended up after that crazy vacation with my wife. I ended up going to the Baker Library. I happened to be giving a speech at Harvard, and I walk in there, and I had some time, and I asked the librarian. I said, "Can I see these boxes?" This guy Thomas Lamont, who ran JP Morgan at the time, and I said, "Can I look inside these boxes?" And inside the boxes, his secretary is keeping transcripts of his phone calls with Hoover and Roosevelt. Like, by the way, same way like everybody's probably talking to Trump or Trump today. And I'm like, "Oh my god, I haven't seen it." And you're seeing the conversation. And I thought, "Okay, if you could use those transcripts in an actual story, and then you could figure out, I didn't know if other transcripts existed for all the other characters." Yeah.

Andrew: 有一点，但我想说那不是我的初衷。当我开始着手这件事时，我只是想重新讲述这个故事，弄清楚这些人是谁。在我和我妻子度过那个疯狂的假期后，我去了贝克图书馆。我碰巧在哈佛大学演讲，我走进那里，有点时间，我问了图书管理员。我说：“我能看看这些箱子吗？”这个叫托马斯·拉蒙特的人，当时他经营着摩根大通，我说：“我能看看这些箱子里有什么吗？”箱子里是他的秘书保存的他与胡佛和罗斯福的电话记录。顺便说一句，就像今天大家可能都在和特朗普或特朗普说话一样。我当时想：“哦，我的天哪，我没见过这个。”你看到了这些对话。我想：“好吧，如果你能把这些记录用在一个真实的故事里，然后你就能弄清楚——我当时不知道其他人物是否有其他记录。”是的。

Chamath: Wow. You could recreate this whole crazy situation.

Chamath: 哇。你可以重现整个疯狂的局面。

Andrew: Right? But I didn't go into it thinking, "Okay, this is all one-to-one." And I don't think it is one-to-one. I think there's a lot of leverage in the system today, but it's a different kind of leverage. I like to believe that there's now an **SEC** (Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会). There are other regulations.

Andrew: 对吧？但我开始时并没有想：“好吧，这都是一一对应的。”我也不认为它是一一对应的。我认为今天的系统中有大量的杠杆，但它是不同类型的杠杆。我愿意相信现在有**SEC** (Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会)了。还有其他法规。

Jason: If you believe it, there is one. Paul's doing a good job. He's there.

Jason: 如果你相信，那就有一个。保罗做得很好。他在那里。

Andrew: So, I'm not here to tell you that like we're going off a cliff tomorrow. I think there are probably some things that are happening in our economy today that do mirror that period. And I hope there are some lessons in here. But do you think the regulations that have been put in place over the past hundred years, and there have been several cycles, one of which happened after '08, of trying to create new protective provisions around how we operate in our financial markets, have they actually changed things enough, or does the human element always find its way? It always finds its way to frothiness, to frenzies, to these kind of moments of exuberance, easy money. And this will there'll always be a path, whether some people might argue crypto tokens, there was an **NFT** (Non-Fungible Token: 非同质化代币) moment a few years ago. Wherever the regulation kind of path of least resistance is, that's where everyone goes.

Andrew: 所以，我不是来告诉你们我们明天就要跌入悬崖了。我认为我们今天的经济中发生的一些事情确实反映了那个时期。我希望这里面有一些教训。但是你认为过去一百年里实施的法规，以及几次周期性的尝试，其中一次发生在2008年之后，旨在围绕我们金融市场的运作方式制定新的保护性条款，这些法规是否真的改变了足够多的事情，还是说人性总是会找到出路？它总是会走向泡沫、狂热、这种过度繁荣、轻松赚钱的时刻。而且总会有这样一条路，无论是有些人可能会争论的加密代币，几年前也有过**NFT** (Non-Fungible Token: 非同质化代币)的热潮。无论监管的阻力最小的路径在哪里，人们就会涌向哪里。

David: Totally. That's always going to be the case. That's the human condition. We all want more. You know, there's that great line in "Wall Street 2" where I think Michael Douglas says to Shia LaBeouf, I thought the second "Wall Street" was not as good as the first one, by the way. Says something like, "What's your number?" and he looks at him and he goes, "More." Right?

David: 完全正确。情况总是如此。这就是人性。我们都想要更多。你知道，《华尔街2》里有一句很棒的台词，我想迈克尔·道格拉斯对希亚·拉博夫说——顺便说一句，我觉得《华尔街2》不如第一部——他说：“你的目标是多少？”希亚看着他，说：“更多。”对吧？

Andrew: And that's that's humans.

Andrew: 那就是人性。

David: And that's humans. And "more" means we're all trying to figure out how we're going to get to more.

David: 那就是人性。“更多”意味着我们都在努力寻找如何获得更多。

Andrew: I think that that was what was going on then. To some degree, it's what's going on now. I think it's always going on. It never changes. It's not like there's some unique moment today. Maybe there's technology that's kind of unlocked this kind of new cycle. Look, the other piece of this, and it was actually a lesson for me that I still grapple with today. I think people think the word speculation is like a dirty word. And the truth is, having now written this book and "Too Big to Fail" and just spending, you know, all this time reporting on all this, you need speculation. Speculation is the twin of innovation.

Andrew: 我认为当时就是那样。在某种程度上，现在也是如此。我认为它总是在发生。它从未改变。不像今天有什么独特的时刻。也许是技术开启了这种新的周期。听着，这还有另一方面，对我来说，这是一个我至今仍在努力解决的教训。我认为人们觉得“投机”这个词就像一个贬义词。但事实是，写完这本书和《大而不倒》，并花了所有这些时间报道这些事情之后，你会发现，我们需要投机。投机是创新的双生子。

Chamath: Putting your capital at risk. There is no it's price discovery. It's risk discovery. It is the hard underbelly of innovation. I completely agree with.

Chamath: 把你的资本置于风险之中。没有它就没有价格发现。它是风险发现。它是创新的坚硬腹部。我完全同意。

Andrew: There is no innovation without some speculation. Elon Musk would not have created Tesla and said somebody speculated on him early when it all seemed totally insane.

Andrew: 没有投机就没有创新。埃隆·马斯克就不会创造特斯拉，如果当初在一切看起来完全疯狂的时候，没有人对他进行投机。

Chamath: No. And also, he's probably speculated himself in 50 different ideas that never saw the light of day. That's what it means. It's like you're investing risk capital. That capital is not always money. It's a lot of time, it's time and reputation as well. It's convincing other people to come work on something, and you're doing it speculatively. That's what Silicon Valley does. Betting on the come.

Chamath: 不。而且，他自己可能也投机了50个从未见天日的主意。这就是它的意思。就像你在投资风险资本。这种资本不总是钱。很多时候，它也是时间和声誉。它是说服其他人来做某事，而你是在投机性地做这件事。硅谷就是这么做的。押注未来。

Andrew: And so then the question becomes, how do you create an environment where you can have speculation? Not just have it, but encourage it, but not let it get out of control, right? Like that is the sort of fundamental question.

Andrew: 所以问题就变成了，你如何创造一个可以有投机的环境？不仅仅是允许它存在，还要鼓励它，但又不能让它失控，对吧？这才是根本问题。

### 监管的困境：保护消费者与市场准入

Chamath: What ends up happening, Andrew, is like no one gives a when a big fund manager or a big bank or some kind of dark pool of capital loses money. But when it hits the consumer, when it hits the individual, then there's this rush to protection. It's like we need to protect the system. We need to kind of protect the consumer because they're always the ones that get taken advantage of. Is that kind of fair?

Chamath: Andrew，最终发生的情况是，当一个大型基金经理、一个大银行或某种**暗池资本** (Dark Pool of Capital: 不透明的私募股权或对冲基金资本)亏损时，没有人会在意。但当它影响到消费者，影响到个人时，就会出现一股保护的热潮。就像我们需要保护这个系统。我们需要保护消费者，因为他们总是被利用的一方。这公平吗？

Andrew: 100%. Look, you can look at both of those things. You could look at, by the way, I think an interesting one because we're now dealing with it now is the **accredited investor rule** (合格投资者规则: 一种限制非富裕个人投资特定高风险产品的法规). So, you know, by the way, that really goes back to the late 1930s or 1940. You know, the idea was, "We only wanted the wealthy to be able to have opportunities to invest in private companies because they were the only ones that we thought should be prepared to lose the money, and we didn't want the little guy to lose the money."

Andrew: 100%。你看，你可以从这两个方面来看待。顺便说一句，我认为一个有趣的例子，因为我们现在正在处理它，就是**合格投资者规则** (Accredited Investor Rule: 一种限制非富裕个人投资特定高风险产品的法规)。你知道，这个规则实际上可以追溯到1930年代末或1940年。当时的想法是，“我们只希望富人有机会投资私人公司，因为我们认为只有他们应该准备好承担损失，我们不希望小人物蒙受损失。”

Andrew: Here we are now in 2025, and there's a lot of folks saying, "You know, I want, I want the access. I want the opportunity." And you know, sometimes like, I remember Chamath, you and I probably talked about this years ago. I remember I either talked about like **GameStop** (GameStop: 2021年散户投资者通过Reddit论坛集体推高股价的美国游戏零售商) or some of these other companies and tell people, "You know, oh, you got to be careful guys, this could go wrong." I said that a little bit some about **SPAC** (Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司) stuff and some other things, and people like, "Sorkin, stop it, you're not protecting me, you're protecting the man."

Andrew: 现在我们来到了2025年，很多人都在说：“你知道，我想要，我想要这种参与的机会。我想要这个机会。”你知道，有时就像，我记得Chamath，你我几年前可能谈论过这个。我记得我当时谈论**GameStop** (GameStop: 2021年散户投资者通过Reddit论坛集体推高股价的美国游戏零售商)或一些其他公司，并告诉人们：“嘿，伙计们，你们要小心，这可能会出问题。”我还对一些**SPAC** (Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司)和其他事情说过类似的话，人们就会说：“索尔金，别说了，你不是在保护我，你是在保护权贵。”

Chamath: You're protecting the man. It's a very interesting concept.

Chamath: 你在保护权贵。这是一个非常有趣的概念。

Andrew: So I anyway, I haven't come up with a neat answer about that, but I do think about it a lot.

Andrew: 所以我，不管怎样，我还没有找到一个完美的答案，但我确实经常思考这个问题。

### 《1940年投资公司法》的挑战与现代经济

David: Well, to your point, I think the **1940 Act** (Investment Company Act of 1940: 美国国会通过的一项旨在规范投资公司行为的法律) I think it was, it's been a very complicated piece of legislation because if you fast forward to today, we're still trying to unwind and fit a square peg into a round hole, if you will. The entire crypto economy contorts itself around the 40 Act. All these **BDCs** (Business Development Companies: 商业发展公司，一种投资于中小型私营公司的封闭式基金) contort itself. Private credit contorts itself and why? Well, right now, we don't have the regulatory will to just go and have a wholesale rip and replace of what is really old legislation.

David: 嗯，就你所说，我认为**1940年法案** (Investment Company Act of 1940: 美国国会通过的一项旨在规范投资公司行为的法律)一直是一项非常复杂的立法，因为如果你快进到今天，我们仍然试图解开并把方钉硬塞进圆孔里，如果你愿意这么说的话。整个加密经济都围绕着1940年法案扭曲自己。所有这些**商业发展公司** (BDCs - Business Development Companies: 商业发展公司，一种投资于中小型私营公司的封闭式基金)都扭曲自己。**私募信贷** (Private Credit: 由非银行机构直接向公司提供贷款的融资形式)也扭曲自己，为什么？嗯，现在，我们没有监管意愿去彻底地废除并替换这些真正过时的立法。

Jason: Do you want to just describe the 40s act? Like what's in it?

Jason: 你想描述一下1940年代法案吗？它里面有什么？

David: Well, it was basically written as a way to sort of try to delineate what is a security, what is allowed to be traded, what kind of businesses can be public. And at the time, with the understanding that they had of the economy, it all made sense. There was a pretty bright line of, "Here's a commodity, here's a security, and here's what is allowed." The problem is, as we've seen, is that businesses today in 2025 are way too dynamic, and they don't map to the brittle definitions of 80 years ago. The problem is that when you try to go and rewrite those rules, there isn't the legislative will because what Andrew says comes up over and over again, which is the fear of what could go wrong stops people from doing what I think could go right, and that has pretty profound consequences. I think in part, when you look at what happened in **GFC** (Global Financial Crisis: 全球金融危机，特指2008年的金融危机), you can pull the string back to the 1940s and the 40 Act and people's reaction to regulations. The **savings and loan crisis** (Savings and Loan Crisis: 1980年代美国储蓄与贷款行业的金融危机). That's another one that was absolutely unnecessary but happened because we tried to contort ourselves to expand the economy in ways that were brittle.

David: 嗯，它基本上是为了试图界定什么是证券、什么是允许交易的、什么样的企业可以上市而制定的。在当时，以他们对经济的理解，这一切都说得通。有一条非常清晰的界线：“这是商品，这是证券，这是允许的。”问题是，正如我们所看到的，2025年的企业过于动态，它们无法与80年前的脆弱定义相匹配。问题在于，当你试图重写这些规则时，缺乏立法意愿，因为Andrew所说的反复出现，那就是对可能出错的恐惧阻止了人们去做我认为可能做对的事情，这会产生相当深远的影响。我认为，在某种程度上，当你回顾**GFC** (Global Financial Crisis: 全球金融危机，特指2008年的金融危机)期间发生的事情时，你可以追溯到1940年代和1940年法案以及人们对法规的反应。**储蓄与贷款危机** (Savings and Loan Crisis: 1980年代美国储蓄与贷款行业的金融危机)。那是另一个完全不必要但却发生的事情，因为我们试图扭曲自己，以脆弱的方式扩张经济。

### 1929年股市崩盘中的关键人物

David: Andrew, I want to ask you a question, which is if we go back to the '29, so we have a good sense of the setup. Can you explain the big characters and who they were and the roles that they were playing?

David: Andrew，我想问你一个问题，如果我们回到1929年，我们已经对背景有了很好的了解。你能解释一下主要人物是谁，他们扮演了什么角色吗？

Andrew: Okay. So there's a whole bunch of characters, but I'd say there are two main characters in this book that really drive the storyline. One is Charlie Mitchell, this fellow who runs National City. He is the **Jamie Dimon** (Jamie Dimon: 摩根大通CEO) of his time in terms of fame. He might actually be more like **Michael Milken** (Michael Milken: 曾被称为“垃圾债券之王”的美国金融家) because he really does develop credit for the public. Michael, of course, did it for businesses later. But they used to call him "Sunshine Charlie," and he was on the board of the New York Fed. He was constantly calling for lower interest rates interestingly during all of this, and he was the guy who was not just loaning to speculators and stockholders. He was also loaning money to different brokerage houses across the country.

Andrew: 好的。有很多人物，但我想说这本书中有两个主要人物真正推动了故事情节。一个是查理·米切尔，这个经营国民城市银行的人。就名气而言，他就是他那个时代的**杰米·戴蒙** (Jamie Dimon: 摩根大通CEO)。他实际上可能更像**迈克尔·米尔肯** (Michael Milken: 曾被称为“垃圾债券之王”的美国金融家)，因为他确实为公众发展了信贷。迈克尔当然是后来为企业做的。但他们过去称他为“阳光查理”，他是纽约联储的董事。有趣的是，在这一切期间，他不断呼吁降低利率，他不仅向投机者和股东放贷，他还向全国各地的不同券商放贷。

Andrew: On the other side of the story, in Washington, is a guy who you probably heard of or know, named Carter Glass. Carter Glass was the **Elizabeth Warren** (Elizabeth Warren: 美国民主党参议员，以消费者保护和金融监管立场闻名) of his time, or maybe even like **AOC** (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 美国民主党众议员，以进步主义政治立场闻名). And he would, by the way, he was like a racist Elizabeth Warren, interestingly, given the weird things going on down there at the time. Anyway, he would rail for years about this thing that he described as "Mitchellism." He believed that Charlie Mitchell and what Charlie Mitchell was doing was going to upend the economy effectively. And as the story plays out, they are sort of pitted against each other.

Andrew: 故事的另一边，在华盛顿，有一个你可能听说过或认识的人，名叫卡特·格拉斯。卡特·格拉斯就是他那个时代的**伊丽莎白·沃伦** (Elizabeth Warren: 美国民主党参议员，以消费者保护和金融监管立场闻名)，甚至可能像**AOC** (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 美国民主党众议员，以进步主义政治立场闻名)。顺便说一句，他是个种族主义的伊丽莎白·沃伦，这很有趣，考虑到当时那里发生的一些奇怪的事情。总之，他多年来一直抨击他所说的“米切尔主义”。他认为查理·米切尔和他的所作所为将有效地颠覆经济。随着故事的展开，他们两人互相对立。

Andrew: One of the things that Charlie does is he defies, or at least appears at one point to defy, the Federal Reserve, which is trying to clamp down on speculation. They don't try to raise interest rates. What they weirdly do is they send a letter to all the banks saying, "Please stop lending to speculators." And the banks don't know what that even means. So they stop lending basically to everybody. And Charlie says, "We're not going to have that. So we're going to start lending ourselves." And that sort of creates this whole other dynamic which leads him to end up being in front of Congress. And I don't want to give away the story, but he does get arrested on the steps of his own home for doing some crazy things later in the story. But those two sort of play a big role.

Andrew: 查理所做的一件事是，他藐视，或者至少在某个时候似乎藐视了美联储，当时美联储正试图遏制投机行为。他们没有试图提高利率。他们奇怪的做法是给所有银行发了一封信，说：“请停止向投机者放贷。”而银行根本不知道那是什么意思。所以他们基本上停止向所有人放贷。查理说：“我们不会容忍这种情况。所以我们要自己开始放贷。”这创造了另一种完全不同的局面，导致他最终站在国会面前。我不想泄露故事结局，但他在故事后期确实因为做了一些疯狂的事情而在自家门前被捕。但这两个人物扮演了重要角色。

Andrew: Then you get to see how **Glass-Steagall** (Glass-Steagall Act: 1933年美国通过的一项法律，旨在分离商业银行和投资银行业务) came about, which by the way, is shocking because it is not what you would think at all. It almost has nothing to do, I don't want to say it has nothing to do with breaking the banks apart for like political reasons, but it actually has to do with business reasons, meaning there was like some major bank money and lobbying going on behind the scenes to F over JP Morgan by the guys who were running Chase and the Rockefellers. So, it's wild. The story is wild.

Andrew: 然后你就会看到**格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案** (Glass-Steagall Act: 1933年美国通过的一项法律，旨在分离商业银行和投资银行业务)是如何产生的，顺便说一句，这很令人震惊，因为它完全不是你想象的那样。它几乎与出于政治原因拆分银行无关，我不想说它完全无关，但它实际上与商业原因有关，这意味着当时有一些大银行的资金和幕后游说，企图通过经营大通银行和洛克菲勒家族的人来对付摩根大通。所以，这很疯狂。这个故事很疯狂。

David: Okay. So, just the summary, but the Glass-Steagall, I think as I understand it, basically separates commercial banks and investment banks.

David: 好的。总结一下，格拉斯-斯蒂格尔法案，据我理解，基本上是分离了商业银行和投资银行。

Andrew: Separates commercial banks and investment banks.

Andrew: 分离商业银行和投资银行。

David: And then sets up the **FDIC** (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 美国联邦存款保险公司) basically.

David: 然后基本上建立了**FDIC** (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 美国联邦存款保险公司)。

Andrew: And sets up the FDIC. Again, when you see how that all came together, the FDIC piece of it, the backstory of these laws, it's not coming from consumer protection as much as you're saying lobbying to try to basically like marginalize the **800-pound gorilla** (800-pound gorilla: 形容一个极具影响力、难以忽视的强大实体).

Andrew: 并建立了**FDIC** (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 美国联邦存款保险公司)。再次，当你看到这一切是如何形成的，FDIC的部分，这些法律的背景故事，它与其说是出于消费者保护，不如说是你所说的游说，基本上是为了边缘化那个**八百磅的大猩猩** (800-pound gorilla: 形容一个极具影响力、难以忽视的强大实体)。

David: Exactly. Exactly. And you'll see it. You will be in the room with these people literally going in there, sitting in the White House, begging Roosevelt to do this. And by the way, Carter Glass is actually unhappy about it. I found letters where Carter Glass is like, "This bill is getting taken away from me and is basically being taken over by the bankers," which is almost hilarious because Elizabeth Warren loves to cite this bill as sort of some panacea.

David: 没错。没错。你会看到。你会亲身经历，这些人真的走进白宫，恳求罗斯福这样做。顺便说一句，卡特·格拉斯对此实际上很不高兴。我找到了卡特·格拉斯的信件，他写道：“这项法案正在被我夺走，基本上被银行家接管了。”这几乎是可笑的，因为伊丽莎白·沃伦喜欢把这项法案当作某种万灵药来引用。

### 当代市场：泡沫、杠杆与AI现象

Jason: Andrew, as you look at markets today, just to come back to the modern era, I don't want to ask you the simple like draw the parallels, but are we in, and I've heard you ask this question a lot lately, like, are we in a **monetary bubble** (Monetary Bubble: 由货币供应过度扩张导致的资产价格泡沫)? Are we in an **inflationary bubble** (Inflationary Bubble: 由通货膨胀导致的资产价格泡沫)? Are we in a **speculative bubble** (Speculative Bubble: 由投机行为驱动的资产价格泡沫)? Are we in no bubble?

Jason: Andrew，当你审视今天的市场，回到现代，我不想问你简单地画出平行线，但我们是否正处于——我最近经常听到你问这个问题——我们是否处于**货币泡沫** (Monetary Bubble: 由货币供应过度扩张导致的资产价格泡沫)中？我们是否处于**通胀泡沫** (Inflationary Bubble: 由通货膨胀导致的资产价格泡沫)中？我们是否处于**投机泡沫** (Speculative Bubble: 由投机行为驱动的资产价格泡沫)中？我们是否没有泡沫？

Andrew: So, I'm assuming we're in some bubble, and we just don't know when it's going to pop of some sort. And by the way, we don't know how big it's going to pop either. It doesn't have to be 1929. It could be 1999, could be 2008, could be smaller than that. I don't know. Do I think that there's leverage? I mean, you guys talk about this **AI investment phenomenon** (AI Investment Phenomenon: 人工智能领域的投资热潮) that's taking place right now. And for the most part, the big corporations are spending real cash. So, that's not leverage. But you look at a lot of the real estate plays, the energy plays that are sort of on the periphery of this, there's a lot of leverage there. I think the private credit world, we don't really know where all the leverage lies right now. Now, I don't think that any of that is as leveraged as what we were talking about, this like 10-to-one situation in 1929, or even like the **subprime situation** (Subprime Situation: 次级抵押贷款危机，特指2008年金融危机前的高风险贷款问题) in 2008.

Andrew: 所以，我假设我们正处于某种泡沫中，我们只是不知道它何时会以某种形式破裂。顺便说一句，我们也不知道它会破裂到多大程度。它不一定是1929年那样的。它可能是1999年，可能是2008年，也可能比那更小。我不知道。我是否认为存在杠杆？我的意思是，你们都在谈论现在正在发生的**人工智能投资现象** (AI Investment Phenomenon: 人工智能领域的投资热潮)。而且在很大程度上，大公司正在投入真金白银。所以，那不是杠杆。但是你看看很多房地产投资、能源投资，它们处于这个现象的边缘，那里有很多杠杆。我认为在私募信贷领域，我们现在还不真正知道所有杠杆在哪里。现在，我不认为所有这些杠杆都像我们谈论的1929年那种10比1的情况，甚至像2008年的**次贷危机** (Subprime Situation: 次级抵押贷款危机，特指2008年金融危机前的高风险贷款问题)那样高。

Andrew: But I don't know, at some point you start to look at some of these, you know, like the **Nvidia** (NVIDIA Corporation: 美国的图形处理器和人工智能芯片公司) **OpenAI** (OpenAI: 领先的人工智能研究和部署公司) deal or the **AMD** (Advanced Micro Devices: 美国的半导体公司) deal and there is a little bit of a circular kind of thing going on there for now. And I just don't know where, but that could be, we could still be years away from this, and by the way, it could work out on the other end.

Andrew: 但我不知道，在某个时候你开始看到一些这样的情况，你知道，比如**英伟达** (NVIDIA Corporation: 美国的图形处理器和人工智能芯片公司)与**OpenAI** (OpenAI: 领先的人工智能研究和部署公司)的交易，或者**AMD** (Advanced Micro Devices: 美国的半导体公司)的交易，目前那里确实存在一些循环性质的东西。我只是不知道在哪里，但这可能还需要数年时间，而且顺便说一句，它最终也可能成功。

David: But what about like government monetary fiscal issues? The central bank monetary policy, interest rates, and then the fiscal issue, the government spending right now.

David: 但政府的货币财政问题呢？中央银行的货币政策、利率，以及当前的财政问题、政府开支呢？

Chamath: Ultimately, if you have a devaluation of the dollar, we're seeing gold at 4,000 bucks an ounce. We're seeing the dollar basket trade down. I think one of the worst years we've ever seen this year. Does that ultimately translate into a higher index on the stock market because the dollar is worth less? I mean, could this actually be more of a monetary or fiscal kind of problem than it is a speculative kind of problem?

Chamath: 最终，如果美元贬值，我们看到黄金每盎司4000美元。我们看到美元指数下跌。我认为今年是我们见过的最糟糕的年份之一。这最终是否会因为美元贬值而转化为股市指数的上涨？我的意思是，这实际上可能更多是一个货币或财政问题，而不是投机问题吗？

Andrew: Well, so you would think it would be, but then explain. So yes, I think like the traditional, the classic economist would say this, you know, these things should not be happening at the same time, meaning look at the price of equities, look at the price of gold, look at the price of, you know, US treasuries right now. It doesn't, at least classically, it shouldn't line up the way it's lining up right now. So I just don't know. I would have thought that the investor class would have wanted to charge us a higher premium for our bonds these days for a whole bunch of reasons, but they don't. Maybe that's just like life is relative and other countries are not doing as well, and so we're still the prettiest girl at the dance.

Andrew: 嗯，所以你可能会认为会是这样，但请解释。是的，我认为传统的、经典的经济学家会说，这些事情不应该同时发生，我的意思是，看看现在股票的价格，看看黄金的价格，看看美国国债的价格。它不应该，至少从经典理论上讲，不应该像现在这样排列。所以我只是不知道。我本以为投资者阶层会因为各种原因想对我们的债券收取更高的溢价，但他们没有。也许那只是生活是相对的，其他国家表现不佳，所以我们仍然是舞会上最漂亮的女孩。

David: I think that's exactly right. But we've never seen so much capital, so much printing happening as we see today. I mean, the 7% debt to **GDP** (Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值) in peacetime with an expanding economy. Never seen that before.

David: 我认为这完全正确。但我们从未见过像今天这样如此多的资本，如此多的印钞。我的意思是，在和平时期，经济扩张的情况下，债务占**GDP** (Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值)的7%。以前从未见过。

Andrew: Totally. But then if that's the case, you'd think that we'd all have our money in Bitcoin and or gold, but we don't. Why is that? I don't know.

Andrew: 完全正确。但如果真是这样，你会认为我们所有人的钱都会投入比特币或黄金，但我们没有。为什么会这样？我不知道。

### 记者的限制与市场观察

Jason: How do you invest? Anyone ever ask you that?

Jason: 你怎么投资的？有人问过你吗？

Andrew: Most people don't ask me that. And the truth is, I'm not allowed to invest in individual stocks. It's actually given what I do for a living. That's part of the deal, part of the nunnery that I have to live in.

Andrew: 大多数人不会问我这个。事实是，我不被允许投资个股。鉴于我的职业，这是我必须遵守的协议，是我必须生活在其中的“修道院”的一部分。

Jason: You're long the index.

Jason: 你看好指数基金。

Andrew: I'm long the index. I am long Bitcoin, Bitcoin gold. I'm long the indexes. And no, I, by the way, I wish I could. I thought for many, many years, it's probably shifted now, but for years upon years, I was always, I think Chamath and I have talked about this. I was always worried about buying Bitcoin because I didn't know, I didn't want to be on TV or in the papers.

Andrew: 我看好指数基金。我看好比特币，比特币黄金。我看好指数基金。不，顺便说一句，我希望我能。我多年来一直认为——现在可能变了——但多年来，我一直担心购买比特币，我想Chamath和我谈论过这个。我总是担心购买比特币，因为我不知道，我不想上电视或报纸。

Chamath: Oh, I would do it. I came on CNBC and I would tell Sorcin to buy it at 100 a coin, 200 a coin. Sorcin would show me a clip of Charlie Munger telling me that it was poison, and he would say, "Mon, what do you think?" And I said, "I have tremendous respect for Charlie and Warren, but they're wrong."

Chamath: 哦，我会做的。我上了CNBC，我会告诉索尔金以100美元一枚、200美元一枚的价格买入比特币。索尔金会给我看查理·芒格说比特币是毒药的片段，然后他会说：“伙计，你觉得呢？”我说：“我非常尊重查理和沃伦，但他们错了。”

Andrew: I remember those moments fondly and sadly because I should have, I should have listened. I should have listened.

Andrew: 我深情又遗憾地回忆起那些时刻，因为我本该听的。我本该听的。

Jason: But so, okay, so you have a very balanced kind of portfolio. Pretty vanilla down the middle. Super I'm not going to get index funds. I'm not going to get rich unfortunately on being a journalist that restricts you from access to the markets. I mean, you seem to have a good pulse on what's going on, but really what matters in markets is having a pulse on what the actors in the markets are doing. And you're not able to act on it.

Jason: 好的，所以你有一个非常平衡的投资组合。相当平淡无奇。超级我不会去买指数基金。不幸的是，作为一名记者，你无法通过进入市场致富。我的意思是，你似乎对正在发生的事情有很好的把握，但市场真正重要的是对市场参与者的行为有把握。而你却无法付诸行动。

Andrew: I have misgivings about it, how about that?

Andrew: 我对此心存疑虑，这样说如何？

Chamath: You're the character in your show acts where you have all the inside info, but you can't do anything about it.

Chamath: 你是你节目中的人物，拥有所有内幕消息，却无能为力。

Andrew: Can't do anything about it. Yeah, exactly. But that's the point. I get it. I knew that's what I was signing up for, so I'm cool with it.

Andrew: 无能为力。是的，没错。但这就是重点。我明白了。我知道我签的就是这个，所以我接受。

Jason: I mean, do you like, do you like being a journalist? I mean, do you like sitting as a speculator or an observer versus being an actor? I mean, have you ever thought like, "Man, I really understand markets. I really understand the parallels to history. I've got a good sense of this. I feel like I should play a role. I want to play a role. I can make money."

Jason: 我的意思是，你喜欢做记者吗？我的意思是，你喜欢作为一个投机者或观察者，而不是一个参与者吗？我的意思是，你有没有想过：“伙计，我真的了解市场。我真的了解历史的相似之处。我对这个很有感觉。我觉得我应该扮演一个角色。我想扮演一个角色。我能赚钱。”

Andrew: I think about that. I've thought about that for years. Totally. About, you know, could I, could I be an actor? Could I play a role? And I often go back to the idea, and look, maybe this is not the right way to think about it, but I feel like I've managed to have hopefully some semblance of credibility with some people by doing it this way. And I've been able to be hopefully a good part of the conversation and be engaged in a lot of things. Maybe I could do that as a sort of a direct actor, too. I don't know. I also think, by the way, journalism seems to be changing. **MSM** (Mainstream Media: 主流媒体), legacy media. I mean, by the way, there's a lot of people.

Andrew: 我想过。我多年来一直都在想。完全正确。关于，你知道，我能，我能成为一个参与者吗？我能扮演一个角色吗？我经常回到这个想法，而且，也许这不是正确的思考方式，但我感觉我通过这种方式，设法在一些人那里建立了一些可信度。而且我希望能成为对话中一个好的部分，并参与到很多事情中。也许我也可以作为一个直接的参与者来做。我不知道。顺便说一句，我也认为新闻业似乎正在改变。**主流媒体** (MSM - Mainstream Media: 主流媒体)，传统媒体。我的意思是，顺便说一句，有很多人。

Chamath: Or you could start a podcast and you could just do whatever you want to do.

Chamath: 或者你可以开一个播客，然后随心所欲地做你想做的事。

Andrew: So, I don't know. I don't know what the right answer is.

Andrew: 所以，我不知道。我不知道正确的答案是什么。

### 当代世界的关键参与者

Jason: Tell us who are the characters in the play today. Who are the actors? Who are the main actors that you see in?

Jason: 告诉我们今天这场戏里的角色是谁。谁是演员？你看到的主要演员是谁？

Andrew: That's a good question. Yeah. The main actors, well, I think you'd probably think about them in a couple different ways. You sort of think about on the financial side and probably the tech side and where they sort of come together. So, I think obviously, and then the government piece. So obviously the president, Scott, Howard on the sort of business end of things inside the government. And then I think in the banking or classic banking world, you'd say that probably Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink are probably the most powerful players in the sort of traditional legacy piece, but then you'd probably give a nod to Brian Armstrong at Coinbase as sort of being one of the OGs in sort of wherever you think crypto goes. By the way, I'd probably hats off to Vlad Tenev, who I think's been sort of very outspoken, sort of talk about democratizing finance, right? Like he's sort of represents that. But then you tell me, I mean, I think Sam Altman and Elon and wherever you think AI is headed next and the Google guys.

Andrew: 这是一个好问题。是的。主要参与者，嗯，我想你可能会从几个不同的角度来考虑他们。你可能会从金融方面和科技方面来考虑，以及它们如何结合。所以，我认为很明显，然后是政府部分。所以很明显，总统，斯科特，霍华德在政府内部的商业方面。然后我认为在银行或传统银行业，你可能会说杰米·戴蒙和拉里·芬克可能是传统领域中最有影响力的参与者，但你可能也会提到Coinbase的布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗，他可以说是加密货币领域的老前辈之一，无论你认为加密货币走向何方。顺便说一句，我可能会向弗拉德·特内夫致敬，我认为他一直非常直言不讳，谈论金融民主化，对吧？他代表了这一点。但接下来你告诉我，我的意思是，我认为山姆·奥特曼和埃隆，以及你认为人工智能接下来会走向何方，还有谷歌的那些人。

Jason: But it's interesting because you're playing, you're saying that technology, particularly AI, is playing a key role in fundamentally.

Jason: 但这很有趣，因为你正在扮演，你正在说技术，特别是人工智能，正在根本上扮演着关键角色。

Andrew: It seems like it is. Do you think, you think that's true? Well, I'm asking because you also, I mean, the capital that's moving through banks. There's a whole another set of industries that generate trillions of dollars of revenue that seem to be largely ignored in the conversation about where the economy, where the global economy is, where it's headed, where markets are headed. It's all about AI, right? I mean, and I, I think that's like.

Andrew: 看起来是这样的。你觉得，你认为那是真的吗？嗯，我之所以问，是因为你也在，我的意思是，流经银行的资本。还有一整套其他的行业，它们创造了数万亿美元的收入，但在关于经济、全球经济走向、市场走向的讨论中，它们似乎被很大程度上忽视了。一切都围绕着AI，对吧？我的意思是，而且我，我认为这就像。

Chamath: But that's because, and I guess the question is like, is that a media thing or is that like a real economy thing? I think it's a real economy thing because I think if you, if you X out the **Mag 7** (Magnificent Seven: 指科技巨头，如苹果、微软、亚马逊、谷歌、特斯拉、英伟达、Meta), all of a sudden the economy does not look nearly the same. I mean, I don't want to say we're levitating, but you know, we're either.

Chamath: 但那是因为，我想问题是，这是一种媒体现象，还是真实的经济现象？我认为这是一种真实的经济现象，因为我认为，如果你排除**七巨头** (Mag 7 - Magnificent Seven: 指科技巨头，如苹果、微软、亚马逊、谷歌、特斯拉、英伟达、Meta)，突然间经济看起来就完全不一样了。我的意思是，我不想说我们正在漂浮，但你知道，我们不是。

Andrew: I saw a data point yesterday that said the GDP, quarterly GDP was like flat excluding data center spending. Does that sound right to you? Did you see that?

Andrew: 我昨天看到一个数据点说，季度**GDP** (Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值)在排除数据中心支出后几乎持平。你觉得这听起来对吗？你看到了吗？

Chamath: It's definitely 100 to 200 basis points of GDP.

Chamath: 这绝对是GDP的100到200个基点。

Andrew: Yeah. So sure. So, so let's say if you, if you X out it, if you X out the AI boom, where, you know, where do you really stand? I think that's a real, real-life question. I think the reason why no one's focused on the rest of the economy, first of all, the AI story, I think, is the more exciting part, but it is what I think is, I don't want to say propping up the economy, but it's keeping the economy.

Andrew: 是的。所以当然。所以，假设你，如果你把它排除在外，如果你排除AI热潮，那么，你知道，你真正处于什么位置？我认为这是一个非常现实的问题。我认为没有人关注其他经济领域的原因，首先，AI故事我认为是更令人兴奋的部分，但它是我认为正在，我不想说是支撑经济，但它正在维持经济。

David: Well, I would, I would flip it on its ear. I don't, I think that those comparisons are kind of dumb because at every point in the economy, there are these dynamic reallocation of resources and assets. Things are important at different times. I think the thing with the AI thing is like, what is every company doing to figure out what they look like in a world of AI? And if they're not going to spend that amount of time, their productivity is probably going to on the margin shrink to a net new company that just does what they do just efficiently and better. That's just the cycle of **creative destruction** (Creative Destruction: 约瑟夫·熊彼特提出的经济理论，指旧的经济结构被新的、更有效率的结构取代). We've seen at every point of every meaningful technology.

David: 嗯，我会，我会彻底改变这种看法。我不认为这些比较有点愚蠢，因为在经济的每一个阶段，都存在资源的动态再分配和资产的动态再分配。事物在不同时期有不同的重要性。我认为关于AI的事情是，每家公司都在做什么来弄清楚他们在AI世界中会是什么样子？如果他们不花那么多时间，他们的生产力可能会在边际上萎缩，被一家新公司取代，这家公司只是更高效、更好地做他们所做的事情。这只是我们在每项有意义的技术发展中都看到的**创造性破坏** (Creative Destruction: 约瑟夫·熊彼特提出的经济理论，指旧的经济结构被新的、更有效率的结构取代)的循环。

Jason: So you think we need to be talking about this much more outside of the sort of like tech and data centers?

Jason: 所以你认为我们需要更多地讨论这个问题，而不是仅仅局限于科技和数据中心领域？

David: Yeah, I made this comment. All the private equity wives got their husbands to come in and rail at me in the comments. And I said, you know, the least success I've had at this software company I started has been selling into **private equity** (Private Equity: 私募股权，一种投资于非上市公司股权的投资形式). It's like I have Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000 customers lining out the door. I couldn't sell to one single private equity company what is effectively a platform that uses AI to rewrite all your software. And I'm like, but this is the first company that should be in line. And what it goes to is that their heads are firmly in the sand. And I think that's not a decision on technology. It's a psychological decision. So I think the weird thing with AI is that it pushes people to a place of psychological insecurity. And I think that they think, "I don't want this to be my problem. I need to just wait this out, and somebody else will deal with it in the future." That's very different than other technology arcs. Like, you know, in the **dot-bubble** (Dot-com Bubble: 20世纪90年代末互联网公司股票投机泡沫). That's not what we live through. In the **social bubble** (Social Media Bubble: 社交媒体公司估值过高的泡沫) or the **mobile bubble** (Mobile Technology Bubble: 移动技术公司估值过高的泡沫), it was always like, "Okay, this seems interesting. Let's figure out how to embrace it, take advantage of it." This is the one where many people are like, "Nope, I'm just nope."

David: 是的，我发表了这个评论。所有**私募股权** (Private Equity: 私募股权，一种投资于非上市公司股权的投资形式)的妻子都让她们的丈夫进来在评论区攻击我。我说，你知道，我创办的这家软件公司最不成功的地方就是向私募股权公司销售。我的意思是，我有《财富》500强和《财富》1000强的客户排队等候。我却无法向任何一家私募股权公司销售一个利用AI重写所有软件的平台。我当时想，但这应该是第一家排队的客户。这表明他们把头深深地埋在沙子里。我认为这不是一个技术上的决定。这是一个心理上的决定。所以我认为AI的奇怪之处在于，它把人们推向一个心理不安全的状态。我认为他们认为，“我不想让这成为我的问题。我只需要等待，未来会有人处理它。”这与其他的技术发展轨迹非常不同。比如，你知道，在**互联网泡沫** (Dot-com Bubble: 20世纪90年代末互联网公司股票投机泡沫)中。我们没有经历过那种情况。在**社交媒体泡沫** (Social Media Bubble: 社交媒体公司估值过高的泡沫)或**移动技术泡沫** (Mobile Technology Bubble: 移动技术公司估值过高的泡沫)中，人们总是说：“好吧，这看起来很有趣。让我们想办法接受它，利用它。”而现在，很多人却说：“不，我就是不行。”

### AI繁荣对就业的影响与生产力提升

Andrew: All right, but here's the question. So, you know, 1932 comes around, and we had unemployment in this country at 25%. It was pretty crazy. If the AI boom is as successful as I think we're all excited it could be, and it affects every industry in every way and all the things we're discussing here, there need to be massive productivity gains. Like massive, like crazy. And invariably, productivity gains are sort of a euphemism for cutting costs in some other way. And that ultimately probably is going to have an impact on employment in this country and do more things. Or do more things. And the question is, which one is it? Or by the way, is it a combination of both? I would, I would probably.

Andrew: 好的，但问题是。你知道，到了1932年，我们国家的失业率达到了25%。那相当疯狂。如果AI热潮像我们都兴奋地认为的那样成功，并且以各种方式影响到每个行业以及我们在这里讨论的所有事情，那么就需要有巨大的生产力提升。是那种巨大的，疯狂的提升。而生产力提升往往是“以其他方式削减成本”的委婉说法。这最终可能会对这个国家的就业产生影响，并带来更多事情。或者做更多事情。问题是，究竟是哪一种？或者顺便说一句，是两者的结合吗？我，我可能会。

Chamath: It's a combo. You hire people so that they spend less time doing drudgery and you allow them to work on more important things. Like I'll give you an example. My wife runs a life sciences business, and what's funny is when she looks at AI, she's like, "All of this stuff is trying to sell me speed." And she's like, "I don't want speed. I want quality." She's like, "I'm not trying to make 500 molecules tomorrow. I'm trying to make the right molecule for the right disease, and I'm happy to take five or six years to do it." And right now, I think we're still in the novelty slopware phase of AI where most of it is about speed, and you know, you're spending a lot of money to try to get crappy outcomes out faster. Eventually, we'll replace that with quality outcomes, and they'll take a lot more time, and I think that that's when you'll have the real productivity improvements. Back to life sciences, like these guys want to get drugs for every person, right? That's not a tomorrow thing. That's not like type it in in English and all of a sudden pops out the other end. And so I think we're going to have to take a lot more time. That's when this stuff becomes really real, and that's going to be very exciting.

Chamath: 这是组合。你雇佣人们，让他们花更少的时间做枯燥的工作，并让他们能够从事更重要的事情。我给你举个例子。我妻子经营着一家生命科学公司，有趣的是，当她看到AI时，她会说：“所有这些东西都在试图向我推销速度。”她说：“我不要速度。我想要质量。”她说：“我不是想明天就制造出500个分子。我正在努力为正确的疾病制造正确的分子，我很乐意花五六年时间去做。”而现在，我认为我们仍处于AI的新奇的粗制滥造阶段，其中大部分都是关于速度的，你知道，你花了很多钱试图更快地得到糟糕的结果。最终，我们将用高质量的结果取代它，那将花费更多的时间，我认为那时你才会看到真正的生产力改进。回到生命科学，这些人想要为每个人找到药物，对吧？那不是明天就能实现的事情。那不是你用英语输入，然后突然间就能得到结果。所以我认为我们需要花费更多的时间。那时这些东西才会变得真正真实，那将会非常令人兴奋。

### 1929年后的社会思潮与新政

David: Andrew, did we see coming out of the crash of 1929 a big move towards socialism in this country, saying, "Hey, capitalism has failed us." And you know, how do you kind of speak to the rise of socialism today and the argument that capitalism has failed most Americans?

David: Andrew，在1929年股市崩盘之后，我们国家是否出现了向社会主义的巨大转变，人们说：“嘿，资本主义辜负了我们。” 你如何看待今天社会主义的兴起，以及资本主义辜负了大多数美国人的论点？

Jason: Well, so yes, sorry. And to add on to that, do you think the **New Deal** (New Deal: 罗斯福总统为应对大萧条而推行的一系列经济和社会改革计划) would have looked the same or would there have even been a New Deal if there hadn't been a crash in 2019?

Jason: 嗯，所以是的，抱歉。补充一点，你认为如果2019年没有发生崩盘，**罗斯福新政** (New Deal: 罗斯福总统为应对大萧条而推行的一系列经济和社会改革计划)会是同样的样子吗？甚至还会有新政吗？

Andrew: Okay, so two quick answers. Yes, that conversation happened, but not nearly as quickly as it happened, for example, after **GFC** (Global Financial Crisis: 全球金融危机，特指2008年的金融危机) of 2008. So I remember being down at like **Zuccotti Park** (Zuccotti Park: 2011年“占领华尔街”运动的中心地点), Wall Street, **Occupy Wall Street** (Occupy Wall Street: 2011年在美国纽约发起的社会运动，旨在抗议社会和经济不平等), all of this conversation we're having now about socialism versus capitalism. Like that happened immediately. In 1929, that conversation did not happen immediately. Part of the reason it didn't happen is because there was sort of like a slow roll on the economy and even the market. So there was sort of a disconnect between the economy and the market. People forget at the end of '29, the stock market actually was down only 17% by the end, and so people thought it was actually going to come back. There were times when it actually seemed to be coming back, and Hoover had this idea that it was almost like a psychological problem and that the market and the economy were detached from each other.

Andrew: 好的，两个简短的答案。是的，那场对话发生了，但远没有像2008年**全球金融危机** (GFC - Global Financial Crisis: 全球金融危机，特指2008年的金融危机)之后那么快。我记得在**祖科蒂公园** (Zuccotti Park: 2011年“占领华尔街”运动的中心地点)、华尔街、**占领华尔街运动** (Occupy Wall Street: 2011年在美国纽约发起的社会运动，旨在抗议社会和经济不平等)时，我们现在关于社会主义与资本主义的所有这些讨论。那几乎是立即发生的。而在1929年，那场对话并没有立即发生。部分原因是因为经济甚至市场都经历了一个缓慢的下滑过程。所以经济和市场之间存在一种脱节。人们忘记了在1929年底，股市实际上只下跌了17%，所以人们认为它实际上会反弹。有几次它看起来确实在反弹，胡佛总统认为这几乎是一个心理问题，市场和经济彼此脱节。

Andrew: He then starts making all of these sort of frankly mistakes. Obviously the Fed doesn't flood the system. Hoover decides he wants to raise taxes. He does **Smoot-Hawley** (Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: 1930年美国通过的旨在保护国内产业的高关税法案) with tariffs. That's something he had pledged to do to try to get farmers to actually vote for him. And he thought that was like a pledge that he had to keep. And so there's a whole sort of set of policies that came into play. And the **Hoovervilles** (Hoovervilles: 大萧条时期美国出现的贫民窟，以讽刺胡佛总统) don't show up in these sort of like tented camps, sort of think Zuccotti Park. That doesn't happen really till 1932.

Andrew: 接着，他开始犯下所有这些坦率地说都是错误的事情。显然，美联储没有向系统注入大量资金。胡佛决定要增税。他实施了带有关税的**斯姆特-霍利法案** (Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act: 1930年美国通过的旨在保护国内产业的高关税法案)。那是他为了争取农民投票而承诺要做的。他认为那是他必须遵守的承诺。因此，一系列政策开始生效。而**胡佛村** (Hoovervilles: 大萧条时期美国出现的贫民窟，以讽刺胡佛总统)这种帐篷营地，就像祖科蒂公园那样的，直到1932年才真正出现。

Andrew: And when you go back and look at why Roosevelt won, it wasn't actually on the economy. If you go and look at the polls, it was over **prohibition** (Prohibition: 1920-1933年美国禁止生产、销售和运输酒精的时期), crazily enough. And so it didn't have that sort of social effect. Having said that, you know, famously Roosevelt, on his inauguration day, goes after the bankers in the inaugural address. And then, of course, the **New Deal** (New Deal: 罗斯福总统为应对大萧条而推行的一系列经济和社会改革计划) shuts down the banks, has what was equivalent of national holiday. 9,000 banks go out of business, and then that's sort of when the conversation about capitalism and socialism starts to rear its head.

Andrew: 当你回过头来看罗斯福为何赢得选举时，实际上并不是因为经济。如果你去看民意调查，令人惊讶的是，原因在于**禁酒令** (Prohibition: 1920-1933年美国禁止生产、销售和运输酒精的时期)。所以它并没有产生那样的社会效应。话虽如此，你知道，罗斯福在他就职当天，在他的就职演说中，就对银行家们进行了抨击。然后，当然，**新政** (New Deal: 罗斯福总统为应对大萧条而推行的一系列经济和社会改革计划)关闭了银行，实行了相当于全国假期的措施。9000家银行倒闭了，然后关于资本主义和社会主义的讨论才开始浮出水面。

David: I think it's because at that point in American history, we had not yet made the promise to the average American that they have the right or the opportunity to buy a home, to get a college education, to have progressive income every year. As you point out, most folks were transitioning from an agrarian to an industrial economy. And so the big transition in life had been, "Wow, I can get an apartment. I don't have to work 12 hours a day grueling physical labor in the fields. I can actually live and walk to a grocery store and get amazing food and meet people and socialize and live in this amazing city." And it was before we had made all of these promises that I think led to these expectations that folks then end up feeling disappointed by, and they blame it all on the failure of capitalism. My personal opinion, as you know, is that it's fundamentally a function of overspending by the government and overpromising, rather than allowing natural market forces to bring everyone up, which fundamentally, I think, created and creates a lot of the distrust and the issues we face.

David: 我认为那是因为在美国历史的那个时期，我们还没有向普通美国人承诺，他们有权或有机会购买房屋、接受大学教育、每年获得递增的收入。正如你所指出的，大多数人正从农业经济向工业经济转型。所以生活中最大的转变是：“哇，我能租到一套公寓。我不用每天在田地里做12小时的艰苦体力劳动。我实际上可以生活，可以步行到杂货店买到美味的食物，结识朋友，社交，生活在这个令人惊叹的城市里。”而那是在我们做出所有这些承诺之前，我认为这些承诺导致了人们最终感到失望的期望，他们把这一切都归咎于资本主义的失败。我的个人观点，如你所知，是这根本上是政府过度开支和过度承诺的结果，而不是允许自然市场力量提升每个人，这从根本上说，我认为，创造并正在创造我们面临的许多不信任和问题。

Andrew: Can I just add on top of that because you know, you're describing what I always think of as sort of the **Leave It to Beaver American Dream** (Leave It to Beaver American Dream: 指20世纪50年代美国中产阶级家庭的理想生活模式), that people sort of have in their mind, which is really more of like a 1950s style dream and actually was a function, I think, of a post-World War situation where the country was, we were monopoly power, everybody else was out of business. This is also the time like the reason why unions even worked, I would argue, for in large part was because there was this period of time where we were the only players in town, and so we could, we could charge monopoly rents for a lot of things, and people could buy a house with a white fence and have two kids and have an ed, all of those things that we now say are the dream. I'm look, there's some people who think that was an aberration in history. I hope it wasn't, but I'm saying there were a lot of forces at play that created that dream, but I don't think that was the dream in 1929.

Andrew: 我能补充一点吗？因为你知道，你正在描述我一直认为是**《留下它给海狸》式的美国梦** (Leave It to Beaver American Dream: 指20世纪50年代美国中产阶级家庭的理想生活模式)，人们心中都有这样的梦想，它实际上更像是1950年代的梦想，而且我认为，它实际上是战后局势的一个产物，当时美国是垄断强国，其他所有国家都陷入困境。这也是工会之所以能发挥作用的原因，我敢说，很大程度上是因为在那段时间里，我们是城里唯一的玩家，所以我们可以对很多东西收取垄断租金，人们可以买带白色篱笆的房子，生两个孩子，接受教育，所有这些我们现在称之为梦想的东西。我看，有些人认为那是历史上的一个反常现象。我希望不是，但我想说，有很多因素共同创造了那个梦想，但我认为那不是1929年的梦想。

### 帝国终结与社会契约的未来

Chamath: Yeah. Do you buy into **Ray Dalio**'s (Ray Dalio: 桥水基金创始人，以宏观经济周期理论闻名) points of view that we're at the end of an empire, end of a cycle?

Chamath: 是的。你认同**瑞·达利欧** (Ray Dalio: 桥水基金创始人，以宏观经济周期理论闻名)的观点吗？他认为我们正处于一个帝国的末期，一个周期的终结？

Andrew: I hope we're not. I hope we're not. I you, you look, I think, I think you look at a lot of the things going on right now, just with how much debt we have. I, I sort of look at the **Niall Ferguson** (Niall Ferguson: 苏格兰历史学家，以其对帝国兴衰的研究闻名) view of the world, which maybe lines up pretty directly with Gallia, which is that when you get, you know, GDP, you start to look at like defense spending as a percentage of GDP, there is this point at which, at least historically, you have like a real problem, and that sort of has set it, created the end of the empire. I think that happens in his view of the world in like 2040, so maybe there's still time to turn it around. I don't know what you, what about you?

Andrew: 我希望我们不是。我希望我们不是。我认为，你看看现在发生很多事情，仅仅是我们背负的债务量。我有点倾向于**尼尔·弗格森** (Niall Ferguson: 苏格兰历史学家，以其对帝国兴衰的研究闻名)的世界观，这可能与达利欧的观点相当一致，那就是当你看到GDP时，你开始审视国防开支占GDP的比例，在某个点上，至少从历史上看，你就会面临一个真正的问题，这似乎已经决定了，并创造了帝国的终结。我认为在他的世界观中，这大约发生在2040年，所以也许还有时间扭转局面。我不知道你，你觉得呢？

Chamath: It's a very exact forecast, 2040.

Chamath: 这是一个非常精确的预测，2040年。

David: You ever read that um, what's that series, the **Asimov series** (Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series: 艾萨克·阿西莫夫的科幻小说系列，其中包含“心理史学”概念) on where they've got this like social forecasting capability? Sorry, totally forgot. Sorin, do you think that if you look at GDP going through the crash, it basically like cratered? And then I mean, whatever we think of the New Deal, I think the reality is that it just created an enormous amount of investment that then just turned GDP around. Is there a version of the New Deal that America needs to do today? Is there a new compact we need to have with our citizenry today?

David: 你读过那个，嗯，那个系列，**阿西莫夫系列** (Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series: 艾萨克·阿西莫夫的科幻小说系列，其中包含“心理史学”概念)吗？里面有这种社会预测能力。抱歉，完全忘了。索尔金，你认为如果看看经历崩盘后的GDP，它基本上就像是坠落了？然后我的意思是，无论我们对新政怎么看，我认为现实是它只是创造了巨大的投资，然后就扭转了GDP。美国今天需要一个新政的版本吗？我们今天需要与公民建立一个新的社会契约吗？

Andrew: Well, but so there's two things that happened though. There's the New Deal and then World War II. I mean, so yeah, I think you have to sort of lump them in a way together in terms of the spending profile and why we were spending.

Andrew: 嗯，但是发生了两件事。有新政，然后是第二次世界大战。我的意思是，是的，我认为你必须把它们在某种程度上归为一类，就支出构成以及我们为什么支出而言。

David: Well, even I think even in the mid-30s though, like really before we were engulfed in it, we were, we were cranking like 8, 10% GDP. My point is just more, just that idea of a new social compact, a new set of like agreements.

David: 嗯，即使我认为在30年代中期，也就是在我们完全陷入其中之前，我们正在以8%、10%的GDP增长。我的意思只是更多地指一种新的社会契约，一套新的协议。

Andrew: I don't know like is is we at a point, maybe maybe we do but what does that look like and and where are we going to get the money to to spend it that's the real question and how can we.

Andrew: 我不知道我们是否到了一个节点，也许我们确实到了，但那会是什么样子？我们从哪里弄到钱来花？这才是真正的问题，我们该怎么做？

David: I think Freeberg would say, well, I'm not going to put words in Freeberg's mouth, is that the agreement is actually not about spending more, but actually less, and getting folks to understand that these trade-offs need to happen.

David: 我想弗里伯格会说，嗯，我不想替弗里伯格说话，但他的意思是，协议实际上不是关于花更多的钱，而是花更少的钱，让人们明白这些权衡是必须发生的。

Andrew: So I, I agree with you, and I agree with David on that. Like, I think we have to cut spending in a big way, but this goes back to the "more" issue, which everybody, everybody wants more.

Andrew: 所以我，我同意你的看法，也同意David的看法。我认为我们必须大幅削减开支，但这又回到了“更多”的问题上，每个人，每个人都想要更多。

Chamath: The irony, Sorkin, and I've shared this point of view many, many times, but I think when we made the promise, when the federal government and people who got elected to represent the population in the federal government got elected, they said, "We're going to give you an education," and then we're going to use federal spending to do that. "We're going to give you access to a home. We're going to create this federal home loan program." And in all these cases, when there was a promise made on giving you the "more," it was all about increasing government spending. "We're going to give you access to healthcare." And then Medicare became kind of this ballooning spending line because in every case, because it's not actually a free market, the government doing the spending gets taken advantage of, and all the costs underlying that spending line get inflated because there's no natural market force of buy and sell. There's only a market force of buy. And that's why education costs have ballooned. That's why housing has ballooned. That's why medical expenses, pharmaceutical drugs have all ballooned. Because as soon as the government provides that as a service, it completely distorts the market, and you can never get out of that freefall.

Chamath: 索尔金，讽刺的是，我多次分享过这个观点，但我认为当我们做出承诺时，当联邦政府和那些被选出来代表民众的联邦政府官员当选时，他们说：“我们要给你教育。”然后我们就会用联邦开支来实现这一点。“我们要让你有机会拥有住房。我们要创建这个联邦住房贷款计划。”在所有这些案例中，当承诺给予你“更多”时，都是关于增加政府开支。“我们要让你获得医疗保健。”然后医疗保险就成了这种不断膨胀的开支项目，因为在每一个案例中，由于它实际上不是一个自由市场，政府的开支被利用，所有支撑该开支项目的成本都被抬高了，因为没有自然的买卖市场力量。只有买的市场力量。这就是为什么教育成本飙升。这就是为什么住房成本飙升。这就是为什么医疗费用、药品都飙升了。因为一旦政府将此作为一项服务提供，它就完全扭曲了市场，你就永远无法摆脱那种自由落体。

Chamath: So the fundamental challenge is you have to have the more difficult conversation to your point of "it's not more, it's less," and we're all going to have to kind of deal with that, or you're going to do the same thing that everyone's done historically, which is wealth taxes and, you know, growth slow, all the stuff that kind of we've seen many times before. So, but this is now you're talking about like a political, it's almost a paradox or a challenge, which is how do you get the public to buy into the idea of less, right? That is the fundamental question. We all know that we have to spend less.

Chamath: 所以根本的挑战在于，你必须进行更艰难的对话，就像你说的“不是更多，而是更少”，我们都必须应对这个问题，否则你就会做历史上每个人都做过的事情，那就是财富税，以及，你知道，增长放缓，所有我们以前见过很多次的事情。所以，但这现在你谈论的是一个政治上的，几乎是一个悖论或挑战，那就是你如何让公众接受“更少”这个想法，对吧？这才是根本问题。我们都知道我们必须减少开支。

Andrew: I agree with that. I'm, and I, and by the way, I feel blessed that I could probably afford it but to take less. But the question is, you know, if you don't have it, taking less.

Andrew: 我同意这一点。而且顺便说一句，我觉得我很幸运，我可能负担得起，但要少拿。但问题是，你知道，如果你没有，却要少拿。

David: They'll say, "Yeah, rich guys like you guys can say that. Good for you." Like, that's not fair to me. And I think that's the big issue is the people who would proclaim that would be immediately attacked like, "You live with less, tax the rich," and that becomes where Dalio and others have argued historically. You see these notions of civil unrest, of civic splits that happen. By the way, the book is **Foundation** (Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series: 艾萨克·阿西莫夫的科幻小说系列，其中包含“心理史学”概念), the Foundation series. I don't know why it didn't come to my mind. The idea is called **psychohistory** (Psychohistory: 阿西莫夫科幻小说中虚构的科学，通过数学方法预测人类社会的未来), where the guy can actually predict all of these social trends because they're all predictable, and they all happen in cycles.

David: 他们会说：“是的，像你们这样的富人当然可以说这些话。对你们来说很好。”就像，这对我来说不公平。我认为这就是大问题所在：那些宣扬这种观点的人会立即受到攻击，比如“你过得少点，对富人征税”，这就成了达利欧和其他人历史上争论的焦点。你会看到这些社会动荡、公民分裂的观念。顺便说一句，那本书是《**基地** (Foundation: 艾萨克·阿西莫夫的科幻小说系列，其中包含“心理史学”概念)》，《基地》系列。我不知道为什么我刚才没想起来。这个想法叫做**心理史学** (Psychohistory: 阿西莫夫科幻小说中虚构的科学，通过数学方法预测人类社会的未来)，那个人实际上可以预测所有这些社会趋势，因为它们都是可预测的，而且都以周期性的方式发生。

### 关税、国家安全与战略选择

Jason: Okay. Can I just throw one other thing in this because I'm so curious about it, and I spent a lot of time thinking about Smoot-Hawley in terms of tariffs. So there's an argument, I think, a fair argument that tariffs are now tying to national security resilience today. And like, we may decide philosophically, you want to have an automobile industry in the United States because if you let **BYD** (BYD Company Ltd.: 中国的电动汽车制造商) sell cars in this country, we would not sell cars in this country, and we wouldn't make cars in this country ever again. And you may think that that's a bad idea, and you want that to be here. Having said that, if we do this, which we are, we will probably spend more to buy less technologically capable cars 10 years from now than the next time we all, you know, if you go on vacation to Europe or Asia and get in the back of one of these other cars. And how should we think about that? That to me is like a real fundamental question about capitalism and also about resilience and national security.

Jason: 好的。我能再补充一点吗？因为我对此非常好奇，我花了很多时间思考斯姆特-霍利法案在关税方面的作用。所以有一个论点，我认为是一个合理的论点，即今天的关税与国家安全韧性息息相关。而且，我们可能会在哲学上决定，你希望美国拥有一个汽车产业，因为如果你让**比亚迪** (BYD Company Ltd.: 中国的电动汽车制造商)在这个国家销售汽车，那么我们将不会在这个国家销售汽车，也将永远不会再在这个国家生产汽车。你可能会认为那是个坏主意，你希望这个产业留在这里。话虽如此，如果我们这样做，而我们正在这样做，那么十年后，我们可能会花更多的钱购买技术能力较差的汽车，而不是像我们下次去欧洲或亚洲度假时，坐上那些其他国家的汽车。我们应该如何思考这个问题？对我来说，这是一个关于资本主义以及韧性和国家安全的真正根本性问题。

Chamath: What I would offer to you is the way that we should think about this is how do Americans and American society preserve maximum optionality in the face of very difficult decisions in the future. So if geopolitically we are induced into a war, all wars have tremendously bad consequences. How would we have the wherewithal to not have to be a part of it? If you look at the last number of wars, these are all ultimately over resources. And if you think about resource independence, there are many, many things today where America is just fundamentally unstable because we don't have resource independence. But if we were to get that, and then we had the building blocks, we wouldn't actually have to fight a war. Now, there may be other reasons, and people may pull us into wars, and I get all of that, but I think that that's a really big question. Would I be okay with a less better car, but having a national transportation infrastructure that we control and cannot be turned off by somebody else? On the margins, I would say, yeah, I'd be okay with that.

Chamath: 我想给你提供的是，我们应该这样思考：美国人和美国社会如何在未来面临非常艰难的决策时，保留最大的选择权。所以，如果地缘政治上我们被卷入战争，所有的战争都会带来极其糟糕的后果。我们如何才能有能力不参与其中？如果你看看过去的一些战争，它们最终都是为了资源。如果你考虑资源独立性，今天有很多很多事情让美国从根本上不稳定，因为我们没有资源独立性。但如果我们能实现这一点，并且有了基础，我们实际上就不必打仗。当然，可能还有其他原因，人们可能会把我们拖入战争，我理解所有这些，但我认为这是一个非常大的问题。我是否愿意接受一辆不那么好的车，但拥有一个我们控制的、不会被他人关闭的国家交通基础设施？从边际上看，我会说，是的，我愿意接受。

Andrew: And the interesting part though is there's going to be a premium on that, right? Like we're going to pay more for that. And that may be, that may just be the cost of doing business.

Andrew: 但有趣的是，这会有一个溢价，对吧？我们为此要付出更多。那可能，那可能只是做生意的成本。

Chamath: Sure. And that may, that's that may be the cost of strategic flexibility and optionality. And I think if you just think about what the downstream consequences of not having that are.

Chamath: 当然。那可能是战略灵活性和选择性的代价。我认为如果你只考虑不拥有这些的下游后果。

Andrew: And maybe, and by the way, maybe those costs are even higher, and and we and those costs don't get added, and they don't get added into the model.

Andrew: 而且也许，顺便说一句，也许这些成本甚至更高，而且我们没有把这些成本加进去，它们没有被加入到模型中。

Chamath: You're absolutely right. They're always higher because they're measured in human lives. It's always higher. It's always more costly.

Chamath: 你说得完全正确。它们总是更高，因为它们是用人的生命来衡量的。它总是更高。它总是更昂贵。

### 电影版权与写作心得

Jason: Andrew, who do you sell the movie rights to of your book and when's the movie coming out?

Jason: Andrew，你把你的书的电影版权卖给了谁？电影什么时候上映？

Andrew: Uh, haven't sold them yet. We're talking to a couple people. Hopefully, we'll have some news on that sometime soon.

Andrew: 嗯，还没卖出去。我们正在和几个人谈。希望很快会有消息。

Jason: Because it sounds like it's a very people-driven story. So, it should make for kind of great drama, right?

Jason: 因为这听起来像是一个非常以人物为驱动的故事。所以，它应该能拍成一部很棒的戏剧，对吧？

Andrew: Oh, totally. I mean, I tried to write it, I didn't try to write it for film per se, but I tried to write it in as cinematic a way as humanly possible, given that I was also constrained by, you know, I had to have archives and notes and diaries. You know, it looks like a long book. By the way, folks, it's a little bit shorter because there are a hundred some odd pages of endnotes at the end for those who want to, and by the way, some of the endnotes are kind of fun.

Andrew: 哦，完全正确。我的意思是，我尝试去写它，我没有刻意为电影而写，但我尝试以尽可能电影化的方式去写，考虑到我也受到了一些限制，比如我必须有档案、笔记和日记。你知道，它看起来像一本很长的书。顺便说一句，各位，它实际上短一些，因为后面有大约一百多页的注释，供那些想看的人阅读，而且，顺便说一句，有些注释还挺有趣的。

Jason: Andrew, when you write these things, do you, and then when you license it, for example, like when they started to make "Billions"? Do you take a strong point of view and how the scripts in that case or the screenplay in this case will be written, or do you kind of say, "Okay, here's my source material. You guys do the best you can," and you kind of, do you care who the actors are? Do you care about any of that stuff? Or do you think it's like, "Okay, they're licensing it off, off on your merry way. Do the best you can?"

Jason: Andrew，当你写这些东西，然后当你授权出去时，比如说，当他们开始制作《亿万》时？你是否会就剧本或电影剧本的编写方式持有强烈观点，还是会说：“好吧，这是我的原始材料。你们尽力而为。”你是否关心演员是谁？你关心这些事情吗？或者你觉得是：“好吧，他们正在授权，祝你们一路顺风。尽力而为吧？”

Andrew: You know, I think actually in this day and age just because it's probably in your mind, right? You have a vision of what this whole thing looks like visually. You probably have faces, right? You probably, you probably have all of this. So, how do you, do you let go of that, or?

Andrew: 你知道，我认为实际上在当今这个时代，仅仅因为这些可能就在你的脑海里，对吧？你对整个事情的视觉呈现有一个设想。你可能已经有了面孔，对吧？你可能，你可能拥有所有这些。那么，你如何，你会放手吗，还是？

Andrew: Well, I think you first of all, I think you have to let go a little bit at some level because that's just the nature of the business for better or worse. I think right now in this streaming environment, you know, there are sort of two ways you can go sell projects like this. One is you go sell it to a streamer, and they go off and they try to develop it. They go find the team that does it. The other approach is, you know, find the actor, maybe a director, maybe the writer all at one time and then walk in with it. So in that context, you probably have more of a say in the future of it. You know, right now, just the way the business is, you know, Hollywood's buying a lot less stuff, and I think is more interested in sort of the former version where you show up with the whole thing sort of prepackaged, pre-planned, but you know, it almost changes, you know, by the month in terms of what they want.

Andrew: 嗯，我想首先，你必须在某种程度上放手一点，因为无论好坏，这都是这个行业的本质。我认为现在在这个流媒体环境下，你知道，有两种方式可以出售这样的项目。一种是你把它卖给一个流媒体平台，然后他们去开发它。他们去找团队来做。另一种方法是，你知道，一次性找到演员，也许是导演，也许是编剧，然后带着它上门。所以在那种情况下，你对它的未来可能更有发言权。你知道，现在，就这个行业的现状而言，好莱坞购买的东西少了很多，而且我认为他们更倾向于前一种模式，就是你带着整个预包装、预先计划好的东西出现，但你知道，他们想要的东西几乎每个月都在变。

Jason: Are you doing the audiobook yourself? Were you reading the?

Jason: 你自己录制有声书吗？是你自己读的吗？

Andrew: I read it. You guys are in the audio business yourselves. So I will tell you, I went in, it's 13 hours, the book in total. You do it on, you know, double time, and you'll be done in six and a half hours. But it probably took me like 30 hours. It takes a while, and they do it.

Andrew: 我读的。你们自己也在做音频业务。所以我要告诉你们，我进去录了，整本书有13个小时。你用两倍速听，六个半小时就能听完。但这可能花了我30个小时。这需要一段时间，他们会做。

Jason: I did do it. Yeah. I did it. It was fun. It was like.

Jason: 我确实做了。是的。我做了。很有趣。就像。

Chamath: Was it your first time reading the audiobook?

Chamath: 这是你第一次录有声书吗？

Andrew: I've never read it before. When "Too Big to Fail" came out, we had a British actor do it, and I enjoyed, I enjoyed listening to him. He added some gravitas to the project because, you know, the Brits always sound smarter than us.

Andrew: 我以前从未读过。当《大而不倒》出版时，我们请了一位英国演员来读，我很喜欢听他读。他给这个项目增添了一些分量，因为你知道，英国人听起来总是比我们聪明。

Jason: Sounds smarter.

Jason: 听起来更聪明。

Andrew: Sounds smarter. I was going for sounder than us.

Andrew: 听起来更聪明。我本来想说比我们更稳重。

Jason: They do. They do.

Jason: 他们确实如此。他们确实如此。

David: Well, Andrew, thanks for joining us. This has been awesome. Congrats on the release of your book. Thanks for chatting. Good broad range of topics.

David: 好的，Andrew，感谢你加入我们。这太棒了。祝贺你的书发行。谢谢你的分享。话题范围很广。

Chamath: I'm buying it. I'm buying it.

Chamath: 我要买。我要买。

Andrew: Yeah, I appreciate guys. You know, I enjoy this so much, and I listen to you guys so religiously. So, this is a.

Andrew: 是的，我感谢大家。你知道，我非常享受这个，而且我非常虔诚地听你们的节目。所以，这。

Jason: You're the best, bro. Thanks for doing it. I mean, it's an incredible period of American history that, to your point, not enough people really understand. I'm glad you, so I find it so interesting. That 20-year period, I would say '28 to '48.

Jason: 你最棒了，兄弟。谢谢你做这件事。我的意思是，那是美国历史上一个令人难以置信的时期，正如你所说，没有足够多的人真正了解。我很高兴你，所以我发现它非常有趣。那20年，我会说是从28年到48年。

Andrew: Well, thank you. Wow. It's got everything.

Andrew: 嗯，谢谢你。哇。它拥有一切。

Andrew: Thank you guys. I appreciate it.

Andrew: 谢谢大家。我很感激。

Jason: All right. We'll talk soon. Thanks, man. See you. Thanks, man. I'm going all in.

Jason: 好的。我们很快再聊。谢谢，伙计。再见。谢谢，伙计。我全力以赴。
