### 通才与专才：重新定义成功与成就

大家好，欢迎收听“In Good Company”播客。

<details>

<p class="english-text">hi everybody and welcome to in good company</p>
</details>

今天我们有幸邀请到一位非常特别的嘉宾，他基本上重塑了我们对成功和成就的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">today we have a very special guest joining us somebody who has basically reshaped how we think about success and achievement</p>
</details>

他的著作《**范围**》（Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World: David Epstein所著，挑战了传统智慧，向我们展示了为什么通才往往能在专业化的世界中蓬勃发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">his book range has challenged the conventional wisdom and showing us why generalists often thrive in a specialized World David</p>
</details>

**David Epstein**，很高兴能邀请到您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Epstein what a pleasure to have you here</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 荣幸之至，谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the pleasure is mine thanks for having me</p>
</details>

主持人: 鉴于我们接下来要花一些时间讨论通才和专才，我想先问一个有点“愚蠢”的问题：在您看来，什么是**通才**（Generalist: 拥有广泛知识和技能，而非专注于某一狭窄领域的人）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm just going to start with a kind of a stupid question giving that we are going to talk about generalists and specialists uh for a bit of a time here so what is a generalist in your view</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 这是一个很好的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah that's a great question</p>
</details>

我认为这其中有一些语义上的考量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean there's some semantic aspect to it right</p>
</details>

比如，当我回顾自己的职业生涯时，我曾接受科学家培训，后来我离开了这条道路，成为《**体育画报**》（Sports Illustrated: 一家美国体育杂志）的科学记者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like when I think about my own career I was I used to be training to be a scientist and then I got off that track and became the science writer at Sports Illustrated magazine</p>
</details>

当我这样做时，我的科学界同事突然认为我是一个通才，而我的体育写作同事却突然认为我是一个专才，因为我拥有科学背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so when I did that my my science colleagues suddenly thought of me as a generalist whereas my sports writing colleagues suddenly thought of me as a specialist because I had this science background</p>
</details>

但广义上讲，**通才**是指在某些时候或某个特定时刻，牺牲了不断深入的专业知识，以拓宽自己的视野，连接不同的知识，并扩展自己的“工具箱”，而不是仅仅顺应自然趋势，在职业发展中变得越来越深入和狭窄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think broadly speaking it's someone that at a at certain points or at a certain point sacrifices increasing depth to to broaden themselves and sort of connect knowledge uh and and broaden their their own toolbox as opposed to just kind of going with what tends to be natural momentum of of getting deeper and deeper and more narrow as as you progress</p>
</details>

主持人: 为什么这是一件好事？成为通才有什么优势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and why is this a good thing what are the advantages of being a jist</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 是的，我认为这些优势之所以特别突出，是因为世界正变得越来越专业化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I think the advantages particularly stand out because the the world is getting more specialized</p>
</details>

我认为在20世纪的大部分时间里，这种专业化模式是很有意义的，但事实上，我们现在看到人们大多在心理学家**Robin Hogarth**（一位研究判断和决策的心理学家）所称的“**恶性学习环境**”（Wicked Learning Environment: 目标和规则不明确、反馈延迟或不准确、模式不重复的学习环境）中工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think that made kind of a lot of sense for good portion of the 20th century but in fact now what we see is that people are largely working in uh what the psychologist Robin Hogarth called wicked learning environments</p>
</details>

### 恶性学习环境与通才的优势

为了快速解释一下，Hogarth调和了专业知识研究中的一个难题：一些研究专业知识的人发现，人们通过狭窄的经验会变得更好，而另一些人则发现，他们不仅没有变得更好，反而变得更加自信，但能力却没有提高，这可能是一种非常糟糕的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so to give just a quick background of that Hogarth kind of reconciled this conundrum in expertise research where some people studying expertise saw that people get better with narrow experience and and others saw that they not only don't get better they they get more confident but not better which can be a really bad kind of scenario</p>
</details>

Hogarth说，这取决于一个人所处的工作环境类型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what hogart said is well it depends on the the type of environment that someone is working in</p>
</details>

在**良性学习环境**（Kind Learning Environment: 下一步和目标明确、规则不变、模式重复、反馈迅速准确的学习环境）中，下一步和目标清晰，规则不变，模式重复，反馈迅速准确，人们通过狭窄的经验可以可靠地变得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in a kind learning environment which is next steps and goals are clear uh rules don't change patterns repeat feedback is quick and accurate people get better reliably with narrow experience</p>
</details>

另一方面，是**恶性学习环境**，在这种环境中，下一步和目标可能不会直接给出，规则可能会改变，模式不重复，反馈可能会延迟或不准确，并且涉及大量的人际动态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the other end are what he called wicked learning environments where next steps and goals may not just be given to you or rules may change or patterns don't just repeat feedback could be delayed or inaccurate a lots of human dynamics are involved</p>
</details>

你明年所做的工作可能与去年截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you basically work next year may not look like work last year</p>
</details>

在这些我们日益被推入的工作环境中，因为工作场所的变化比以往任何时候都快，拥有更广泛技能的人，能够灵活应变并创造出通用、灵活技能和心智模型的人，才能真正适应时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and in those kinds of environments which we're increasingly thrust into in our work because the workplace changes more rapidly than it ever has before it's people that have this sort of broader set of skills that allow them to Pivot and to create kind of generalized flexible skills and mental models who are really able to to adapt over time</p>
</details>

越来越多的人正处于这种境地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's the situation more and more people um are in</p>
</details>

主持人: 为什么世界变得越来越“恶性”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so why is the world becoming more wicked</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 我认为，在20世纪的大部分时间里，我们有一种运作良好的模式，人们可以经历一个独立的培训或教育时期，然后根据这些培训或教育进行一个独立的工作时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's well so there was a period for much of the 20th century at least where we had a model that actually worked quite well where people could have kind of a discreet per perod of training or education and then a discreet period of working based on that training or education</p>
</details>

我是在简化，但大致如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I'm simplifying it but but more or less</p>
</details>

公司不会那么快地倒闭，技术创新也不会那么快地改变工作场所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and companies didn't go in out of existence as quickly uh technological innovation didn't um change tend to change the workplace quite as rapidly</p>
</details>

因此，你可以看到在20世纪，人们所从事的不同工作的数量在20世纪下半叶开始增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you can see through the 20th century like the number of different jobs that people have starts to increase in the latter half of the 20th century</p>
</details>

即使人们从事相同的工作，他们实际所做的事情也开始以更快的速度变化，如果他们想保持竞争力，就必须学习新的工具和所有这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and even when people are staying in the same jobs the stuff they're actually doing is starting to change at a much faster pace and they're having to learn new tools and all these things if they want to want to kind of stay competent</p>
</details>

所以我认为，部分原因是技术创新，部分原因是全球化，但对于大多数人来说，那种先培训后工作的模式已经被不断地再学习、再培训和反复重塑所取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think it's you know part technological innovation it's part globalization but it's just that for most people that model of period of training followed by period of working has been replaced with relearning and retraining and having to sort of reinvent over and over and over</p>
</details>

### 如何成为一名优秀的通才：采样期与匹配质量

主持人: 在您的书中，您谈到了一些实现目标所需做的事情，例如拥抱多元经验、专注于学习、保持适应性、寻求跨学科合作等等。要成为一名真正强大的通才，最重要的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in your book you talk about some things um that uh you need to do to get there you need to embrace diverse experience es focus on learning be adaptable um seek out interdisciplinary collaboration and so on what are the most important things you need to do in order to become a really strong jist</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 我认为非常重要的一点是科学家们常说的“**采样期**”（Sampling Period: 职业生涯早期或任何阶段，通过尝试不同领域和活动来探索自身兴趣、能力和机会的阶段）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one of the things I think is really important is what what scientists tend to call the sampling period</p>
</details>

我不想让这听起来像是你只在职业生涯初期才需要这样做，但**采样期**的理念是，在我们真正尝试过一些事情之前，我们对自己的兴趣、能力和机会了解得并不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where and I and I don't want this to sound like you only need to have this at the beginning of your career but the sampling period is this idea that we we don't know as much as we could about ourselves our own interests our own abilities our opportunities until we've actually tried some things</p>
</details>

所以我认为许多成功人士都倾向于经历这个**采样期**，他们尝试一些事情，深入其中，获得关于自己兴趣和能力的反馈和信号，然后根据这些知识进行调整，而不是仅仅埋头苦干，只因为他们开始了某条道路就一直走下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think a lot of successful people tend to go through this sampling period where they try some things they dive into it they get sort of feedback and Signal about what their interests and abilities are and then they pivot uh based on that knowledge as opposed to just kind of staying heads down uh and staying on a path just because they started on it</p>
</details>

例如，在书中我写到了**哈佛大学**（Harvard: 美国著名大学）的一个名为“**黑马项目**”（Darkhorse project: 哈佛大学一项研究，旨在了解那些通过非传统路径获得成就和满足感的人）的项目，该项目研究那些在各种传统指标上都非常成功的人，比如他们赚了很多钱等等，但其因变量实际上是他们的成就感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so for example in the book I write about this project at Harvard called the Darkhorse project that was studying people I mean many of them were like very successful in all sorts of tradition metrics you know they had made a lot of money and things but the dependent variable was really their sense of fulfillment</p>
</details>

这个项目之所以被称为“**黑马项目**”，是因为当他们召集这些受试者进行研究介绍时，人们会说：“嗯，你知道，别告诉别人做我做过的事，因为我就是这样走过来的，我从一件事开始，然后转向了另一件事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">actually the reason it's called the Darkhorse project actually is because when they brought in these subjects just for sort of to orient them to the study that people would say well you know don't tell people to do what I did because you know I came through this I started on this one thing and then I pivoted and and so I was and Dark Horse means like someone who came out of expression that means someone who came out of nowhere</p>
</details>

“黑马”这个词指的是那些出人意料地成功的人，而这竟然成为了常态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that turned out to be the norm</p>
</details>

虽然不是所有人，但绝大多数人都遵循了这样一条道路：他们从一条路线开始，然后说：“好吧，你知道，这其实并不像我想象的那样适合我，但我要把我所学到的知识和现在的兴趣、机会结合起来，去做这件事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it wasn't everyone but it was the very large majority had sort of followed this path where they started down one route and said okay you know this actually doesn't quite fit me the way I thought but I'm going to take what I learned and hear my kind of interest and opportunities right now I'm going to do this one for and maybe a year from now I'll change because I will have learned something about myself and they keep doing this pivoting until they get to better what a conom is called match quality which is a degree of fit between one's interests abilities and the work that one does</p>
</details>

也许一年后他们会改变，因为他们会学到一些关于自己的东西，他们会不断地进行这种调整，直到达到经济学家所说的更好的“**匹配质量**”（Match Quality: 个人兴趣、能力与所从事工作之间的契合程度）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so not only are they kind of triangulating a better fit in their work which turns out to be really important for your sense of fulfillment and for your performance but they get there with this broad kind of array of background experiences that they bring with them in this broad toolbox</p>
</details>

这不仅让他们在工作中找到了更好的契合点，这对于他们的成就感和表现都非常重要，而且他们带着广泛的背景经验和工具箱达到了这个目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think having that habit of Mind where you're always kind of what did I learn from this what can I take to the next experience and continually triangulating better match quality through the course of your career um is a really important kind of habit of mind for someone who wants to be a so-called good generalist</p>
</details>

所以，我认为拥有这种思维习惯——总是思考“我从中学到了什么？我能把这些带到下一次经历中吗？”并在职业生涯中不断地通过三角测量法找到更好的**匹配质量**——对于那些想成为所谓优秀通才的人来说，是一种非常重要的思维习惯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you um also do a lot of work on on Sports um what are some of the examples where people have tried different type of Sports and ended up in a better place</p>
</details>

### 体育中的多样化训练：Serena Williams的例子

主持人: 您还做了很多关于体育方面的工作。有没有一些例子，人们尝试了不同类型的运动，最终取得了更好的成绩？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you know let me tell you one that I that really surprised me because at one point when I was doing some of this I used to be the science writer at Sports Illustrated and when I was talking about some of this just giving a short you know 15-minute talk about some of the sports data in an A Crowd that included Serena Williams in the audience and she sits in the second row and I'm kind of freaking out because you know I'm going to talk about the benefits of diversity and as far as I know she's like the opposite story of that and you can Marshal all the scientific data you want right but if if if the goat stands up and says you're an idiot it's going to be a bad day for you I think</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 是的，我来告诉您一个让我非常惊讶的例子。有一次，当我在做这些研究时，我曾是《**体育画报**》的科学记者。当时我在一个听众中包括**Serena Williams**（塞雷娜·威廉姆斯: 美国著名网球运动员）的场合，做了一个关于体育数据的小型15分钟演讲，谈论多样性的好处。她坐在第二排，我有点紧张，因为我知道她似乎是多样性故事的反例。你可以引用所有你想要的科学数据，但如果这位“史上最佳”（GOAT: Greatest Of All Time的缩写，指在某个领域最伟大的人）站起来说你是个白痴，那对你来说将是糟糕的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it perhaps would have been worse if you had to play against her in tennis but yeah that's the that you know what but I I I I would have rather been a that would have been acceptable embarrassment on the tennis court whereas this was like I was the one on stage so this would have been worse embarrassment for me um</p>
</details>

主持人: 如果你必须在网球场上和她对打，那可能会更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but she stands up afterward and says like to raise her hand for the first question I'm like oh man man and she says I think my father was ahead of his time he had me do track and field Taekwondo gymnastics ballet learn to throw uh a football for the overhand motion for a serve um and and took me and my sister off the traveling tour when he thought it was getting too intense so we could also focus on school and family um</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 是的，但那会是网球场上可以接受的尴尬，而我当时是在台上，所以这对我来说会是更糟糕的尴尬。但她后来站起来，举手问了第一个问题，我说：“哦，天哪！”她说：“我想我父亲走在了时代的前面，他让我练习田径、跆拳道、体操、芭蕾，学习用投掷橄榄球的过手动作来发球。而且，当他觉得训练强度太大时，他把我和我姐姐从巡回赛中带走，这样我们也可以专注于学业和家庭。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I was a senior writer at Sports Illustrated and I had never heard that story right even though that is what a now mountain of scientific research suggests that this diversity early actually sets people up to have these generalized skills what some people call physical literacy these generalized skills that then scaffold later technical knowledge</p>
</details>

我当时是《**体育画报**》的高级撰稿人，但我从未听说过这个故事，尽管现在大量的科学研究表明，这种早期的多样性实际上能让人们获得这些通用技能，也就是一些人所说的“**身体素养**”（Physical Literacy: 具备多种运动技能和知识，能灵活适应不同运动情境的能力），这些通用技能随后为后来的技术知识打下了基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where the the opposite path the one that I thought you know that Serena didn't do I didn't know that she had done all these other things there's actually a fundamental trade-off this gets at what I think is kind of the underlying theme on every page of range there is this trade-off between optimizing for short-term performance and long-term development</p>
</details>

而相反的道路，也就是我以为**Serena**没有走的那条路——我不知道她还做了所有这些其他事情——实际上存在一个根本性的权衡。这触及了《**范围**》每一页的潜在主题：在优化短期表现和长期发展之间存在着权衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so there are now these just tremendous number of studies in sports that show that the way you make the best 10-year-old performer is not the same way as you make the best 20-year-old performance</p>
</details>

现在体育领域有大量研究表明，培养出最优秀的10岁运动员的方式与培养出最优秀的20岁运动员的方式是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's actually an inverse relationship when when like National development pipelines are studied um between between Maxim optimizing Junior performance and optimizing senior performance</p>
</details>

当研究国家发展路径时，优化青少年表现和优化成年表现之间实际上存在着反向关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you want to optimize senior performance you want this kind of sampling period where people do a variety of things it causes them to build these generalized models and generalized skills skills that are then flexible and they they then more rapidly uh learn new skills going forward</p>
</details>

如果你想优化成年表现，你需要这种**采样期**，让人们尝试各种不同的事情，这会促使他们建立这些通用模型和通用技能，这些技能是灵活的，然后他们就能更快地学习新的技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's kind of like people who grow up with multiple languages they actually have a little bit of a delay but that delay doesn't last and they then are advantaged for um learning any subsequent languages it's actually like the same exact mechanism really</p>
</details>

这有点像从小学习多种语言的人，他们一开始会有一点延迟，但这种延迟不会持续很久，之后他们在学习任何后续语言时都会有优势，这实际上是完全相同的机制。

我认为在过去两届冬奥会上，他们的奖牌数量超过了美国和中国之和。

<p class="english-text">I think in one of those Winter Olympics might have even outdone the US China and Germany combined winning things in summer games that we don't usually associate with Scandinavia you know all you you may exaggerate a Tony bit but uh I think uh the general Gest of it is uh is is correct</p>
</details>

我认为在其中一届冬奥会上，他们甚至可能超过了美国、中国和德国的总和，在夏季奥运会上也赢得了我们通常不与斯堪的纳维亚联系在一起的项目。您可能有点夸大其词，但我想其大意是正确的。

<p class="english-text">but David how does this um stack up against uh the 10,000 hour rule and and the concept of deliberate practice which some people is advocating</p>
</details>

### 通才理念与“一万小时定律”的冲突

主持人: 但David，这与“**一万小时定律**”（10,000 hour rule: 认为要精通某项技能需要刻意练习一万小时的理论）以及一些人所倡导的**刻意练习**（Deliberate Practice: 有意识地、有目的地专注于提高特定技能的练习）概念相比如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my first book which criticized some of the research underlying the 10,000 hour rule because the the original research came out of a study that was done on 30 violin students at a world-class Music Academy um the top 10 of whom uh had been found to have practiced spent 10,000 hours by the age of 20 on average in deliberate practice which is this effortful cognitively engaged focused on correcting errors practice you know not playing around not experimenting um</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 我的第一本书批评了“**一万小时定律**”背后的一些研究，因为最初的研究是针对一所世界级音乐学院的30名小提琴学生进行的。其中排名前10的学生，平均在20岁时进行了10,000小时的**刻意练习**，这是一种需要付出努力、认知参与、专注于纠正错误的练习，而不是随意玩耍或实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and there were a lot of flaws in that study one of which is that that nobody actually did 10,000 hours there was like some who did way less and some who did way more in that tiny group um and uh it it averaged a 10,000 hours</p>
</details>

那项研究存在很多缺陷，其中之一是实际上没有人真正达到了10,000小时，那个小群体中有人练习时间远少于此，也有人远多于此，只是平均下来是10,000小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think the issue with the 10,000 hours rule which and I can tell you about after I criticized it Malcolm Gladwell and I became running buddies so we have these arguments on our on our own time but we've come to pretty much the same ground</p>
</details>

但我认为“**一万小时定律**”的问题在于——我可以告诉您，在我批评它之后，**Malcolm Gladwell**（马尔科姆·格拉德威尔: 加拿大记者、畅销书作家，曾推广“一万小时定律”）和我成了跑步伙伴，所以我们私下里会争论这些问题，但我们基本上达成了共识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the idea was that this is the only thing that matters your accumulated deliberate practice and so you should start as early as possible in as narrowly technical practice as you possibly can</p>
</details>

这个定律的观点是，你积累的**刻意练习**是唯一重要的事情，所以你应该尽可能早地开始，并尽可能狭窄地进行技术练习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and except for certain very uh simple activities uh there's a mountain of evidence that suggests this this just isn't right like there's there's almost nothing that actually works in favor of it</p>
</details>

然而，除了某些非常简单的活动外，大量证据表明这并不正确，几乎没有什么能真正支持它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you really want again if you're trying to optimize for the short term sometimes that might make sense but if you want to build both physical and cognitive models that can be flexible for future problem solving a a better rule to think of than the 10,000 hours rule which is very splashy uh is this classic finding that comes out of cognitive psych psychology that can be summarized as breadth of training predicts breadth of transfer</p>

如果你想优化短期表现，有时这可能说得通，但如果你想建立灵活的物理和认知模型以解决未来的问题，那么比“**一万小时定律**”这个引人注目的规则更好的思考方式是认知心理学中的一个经典发现，可以概括为“训练的广度预示着迁移的广度”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so transfer is a term psychologists use to mean taking your skills and applying them to a problem that's not exactly the same as the last one like your ability to to adapt to New Challenges and new tasks</p>
</details>

“迁移”是心理学家用来指将你的技能应用于与上一个问题不完全相同的问题，例如你适应新挑战和新任务的能力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and what predicts your ability to do that which is what we in modern work rely on every day what predicts your ability to do that is the is the breadth of problems youve faced in training</p>

而预测你做到这一点的能力——这正是我们在现代工作中每天所依赖的——是你训练中遇到的问题广度。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when you face a really broad uh sampling of problems in training or lots of different activities it forces you to build these generalized models that you can then kind of slot in to whatever the new challenge is as opposed to just being the opposite where the 10,000 hours approach off leads to what psychologists call the einstellung effect which is where you've solved a problem a certain way so many times you'll continue doing that even if it's no longer the solution</p>
</details>

因此，当你在训练中面对非常广泛的问题样本或许多不同的活动时，它会迫使你建立这些通用模型，然后你可以将它们“插入”到任何新的挑战中，而不是相反，即“**一万小时定律**”的方法往往会导致心理学家所说的“**爱因斯坦效应**”（Einstellung Effect: 指一个人在解决问题时，倾向于使用过去成功的方法，即使这些方法在新情境下不再适用或效率低下），即你以某种方式解决了一个问题太多次，即使它不再是解决方案，你也会继续这样做。

### 专才的必要性与“爱因斯坦效应”的挑战

主持人: 那么什么时候成为专才才是好的呢？显然，你不会希望一个通才脑外科医生给你做手术，对吗？

<p class="english-text">no absolutely not I mean so so okay so I I gave a talk a little while ago to a group of Surgeons that were like so specialized and you know I wanted to be a little provocative um but also I'd written quite a bit about uh uh poor medical practices when I was in investigative reporter and so I brought up some of the data that showed that specialized surgeons have fewer complications in their procedures not only even if you control for the number of times that a surgeon has done a procedure still the surgeons who identify as more specialized still have fewer comp complications so there's something above and beyond even just the number of repetitions they've had about being specialized</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 不，绝对不会。我前段时间给一群非常专业的外科医生做了一场演讲，我想稍微有点挑衅性，但我也曾作为调查记者写过不少关于不良医疗实践的文章。所以我提出了一些数据显示，专业外科医生在手术中并发症更少，即使你控制了外科医生做手术的次数，那些自认为是更专业的医生仍然有更少的并发症，所以专业化不仅仅是重复次数的问题。

<details>

所以这就像一把双刃剑。我们并非不需要那些拥有出色运动记忆，以至于他们的大脑基本上已经将任务的重要部分自动化的人，但这确实是一把双刃剑。

</details>

因此，我认为挑战在于，在那些需要大脑中技能彻底自动化、某人真正精通的领域，比如飞行员或外科医生，我们如何平衡这种需求与**爱因斯坦效应**，即无法看到这不再是正确解决方案的问题。

当我与他们交谈时，我以为他们会严厉批评我，但他们很喜欢我的观点，而且他们都说：“我们知道这是一个问题，我们过度进行这些手术了，我的同事们真的需要好好反思一下。”所以，听到他们解释说，他们都觉得这是一个问题，但都认为不是自己的问题，这很有趣，这是一个有趣的难题，一个棘手的问题。

其他组的学生被随机分配到所谓的“**交错练习**”（Interleaved Practice: 将不同类型的问题或技能混合在一起练习，而非集中练习单一类型），即不是先A后B，而是将所有问题类型随机混合在一起。

</details>

然后当考试来临时，那些进行**交错练习**的学生彻底击败了**分块练习**组，这就像把50百分位的孩子提升到80百分位一样，因为在考试中每个人都必须面对新问题，所以他们必须进行那种迁移，将一些技能应用到新问题上，而他们在这方面准备得更好，因为这种混合练习再次迫使你建立这些通用模型。

</details>

所以我们很多干预项目都专注于所谓的“**封闭技能**”（Closed Skills: 每个人最终都会掌握的基本技能，如阅读、走路），这些是每个人都会学到的东西，就像教孩子比别人更早走路一样，这可能看起来令人印象深刻，但从长远来看并不重要。

<p class="english-text">so I think I would I would make uh to make this interdisciplinarity more cohesive I might organize a curriculum around like the progression of human ideas because I've found in my just my own learning you know in in any given era art and chemistry and biology and technology and economics and all these things are interlaced in a given era and I think I would try to have maybe and and and the way that those ideas progress off one another I think is is very useful for kind of getting a grounding in in human progress and and human thought and so I might Orient the curriculum around around that about whatever the discipline is in teaching people that kind of progression of human ideas and how we got to where we are today and that might have sort of some linkage between the disciplin so it's not just like oh I'm done with math class now I go to history class which is a totally different thing in history and math have nothing to do with one another because obviously that's right</p>
</details>

所以，我认为为了让这种跨学科性更具凝聚力，我可能会围绕人类思想的演进组织课程，因为我发现，在我自己的学习中，在任何一个时代，艺术、化学、生物学、技术和经济学等所有这些事物都是相互交织的。我认为我可能会尝试让这些思想相互推进的方式，这对于理解人类进步和人类思想非常有益。所以我可能会围绕这个方向来设计课程，无论是什么学科，都教导人们人类思想的这种演进以及我们是如何走到今天的，这可能会在学科之间建立某种联系，这样就不会只是“哦，我数学课上完了，现在去上历史课”，而历史和数学完全是两回事，因为显然这是正确的。

David Epstein: 天哪，这真是一个棘手的问题，因为你知道，这不仅仅是男孩的问题，虽然男孩确实如此，但普遍存在“**相对年龄效应**”（Relative Age Effect: 同一年龄组中，出生日期较晚的孩子在学业或体育表现上可能因生理成熟度差异而处于劣势的现象）。这在体育领域也出现过，实际上我认为它最初是在体育领域被发现的，即在同一年龄组或同一年级中，出生较晚的孩子。

</details>

问题在于，就像体育教练会把早熟的孩子误认为是潜力股，仅仅因为他们更大，因为他们大了10个月等等，在学校里，当孩子七八九十岁时，小10个月实际上是一个很大的问题，这会体现在他们的行为上。

我确实认为我们应该尝试对此做些什么。我不知道我们如何能完全纠正这一点，我认为有些国家，特别是像**芬兰**（Finland: 北欧国家，以其高质量的教育系统闻名），在确保孩子年幼时不会被“降级”方面做得很好。可能有一个相对较小的孩子，但他们非常强调不让人被降级，这会让他们陷入一种永远无法摆脱的困境。

<p class="english-text">I mean this is uh really interesting but I mean you have some people of course like Einstein he did his work in a pretty I mean the greatest work in a pretty short period of time you know uh Monk um same kind of things but you got other you got other artists uh you know Beatles went on forever right picazo had one period after the other went on forever Reinventing himself what explains the difference here</p>
</details>

主持人: 这真的很有趣，但当然也有像**爱因斯坦**（Einstein: 著名物理学家）这样的人，他在相当短的时间内完成了他最伟大的工作，还有像**Monk**（可能指爵士乐手Thelonious Monk，或泛指某种专注于单一领域的艺术家），也是类似的情况。但也有其他艺术家，比如**披头士乐队**（Beatles: 英国著名摇滚乐队）一直存在，**毕加索**（Picasso: 西班牙著名画家）一个时期接着一个时期，不断地重塑自己。这其中的区别如何解释？

<p class="english-text">I mean those I think first of all those are those are incredible innovators and I think those you know I think looking at the career of Picasso I think he had more hot streaks than the next person bet um but he did continually go through these like he would Contin enforce these constraints on himself right like his red period or blue period or whatever it was or sometimes he would paint the same subject over and over and over and over and over and over but forcing it to be different kind of every time</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 我认为首先，他们都是令人难以置信的创新者，而且我认为，如果你看看**毕加索**的职业生涯，他可能比其他人有更多的**热潮**。但他确实不断地经历这些，他会不断地给自己施加限制，比如他的红色时期或蓝色时期，或者有时他会一遍又一遍地画同一个主题，但每次都强迫它变得不同。

<p class="english-text">and so I think he was just this Relentless experimenter um and you know and there is also when I think of Picasso this pretty consistent finding that great creators just create more stuff so they they create a lot of bad stuff too you know it's like the proverbial Thomas Edison thousands of patents most of which are completely useless and some of which are like the mass-produced light bulb you know</p>
</details>

所以我认为他只是一个不懈的实验者。而且，你知道，当我想到**毕加索**时，还有一个相当一致的发现，那就是伟大的创作者只是创造了更多的东西，所以他们也创造了很多糟糕的东西。你知道，这就像谚语中的**Thomas Edison**（托马斯·爱迪生: 美国著名发明家），他有数千项专利，其中大部分完全没用，而有些则像大规模生产的灯泡一样。

<p class="english-text">and so I think there's not dispositive evidence of this this is me speculating but I think one of the reasons that the creating so much more is is kind of a Hallmark of these great creators is that that's actually really the only way you learn that that introspection I think has been oversold as a method for learning about yourself and doing stuff has been been undersold</p>
</details>

因此，我认为这没有决定性的证据，这只是我的猜测，但我认为这些伟大创作者之所以创造如此之多，是他们的一个标志，原因之一是这实际上是唯一能让你学习的方式。我认为内省作为一种了解自己的方法被过分推销了，而实践则被低估了。

我甚至和一些我为我的书采访过的研究人员聊过，他们对自己在学术界的职业生涯感到失望，因为他们觉得他们进入了一个本应是思想生活的世界，但后来却被告知……我记得采访过一位研究人员，她说她感到沮丧，因为她觉得自己的职业生涯可能受到了阻碍，因为她不够专业化，因为她想探索更多东西。我去看了她的论文列表，每一篇，大概有48篇论文，每一篇的标题里都有“亚里士多德”，从我的角度来看，她非常专业化，每一篇都是。

所以我认为人们想要好奇，但他们常常觉得好奇心受到了抑制。有时人们达到高管级别或在**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 美国加利福尼亚州北部的一个地区，以高科技产业闻名）工作时，他们才能获得自由并真正充满好奇心，我认为当人们觉得好奇心受到鼓励时，你会看到某种蓬勃发展。

所以我认为，如果领导者或管理者愿意为那些好奇的人承担一些风险，那么很多与生俱来的好奇心就会被释放出来。至于我们是否能为人们创造更多与生俱来的好奇心，我不敢确定，但我认为有很多被压抑的好奇心我们可以释放出来。

有些地方会这样做，比如**3M**（3M: 美国一家多元化科技公司）或**Google**（谷歌: 美国跨国科技公司），他们有“20%时间”之类的政策，他们会说：“不，我们希望你用20%的时间去做这个很可能会失败的事情，比如承担这个个人项目。”就像**Google X**（Google的创新部门）这个创新引擎部门，他们有一些名为“它会变得更好”的视频，视频中人们致力于这些大型项目，然后这些项目，比如用热气球提供高速互联网，技术上可行，但经济上不可行，所以他们制作了一个名为“它会变得更好”的视频，视频中那些投入毕生精力的人，在项目被关闭后，谈论了他们的哀悼和悲伤期，以及他们学到的东西，然后将这些知识应用到一些新项目中。

所以有一项相当引人注目的研究表明，当一个团队面临一个问题，特别是一个不熟悉或困难的问题时，他们解决问题的可能性以及他们提出的不同解决方案的数量，部分取决于他们能从其他领域结构相似的问题中找出多少类比，比如“这像那个吗？”“那像这个吗？”而预测类比数量和广度的，正是团队成员的多样性。

<p class="english-text">and I think that's kind of emblematic of when technological disruption sort of goes well for Society at large is it moves people back to this more strategic level of thinking and takes over stuff that you know it might be scary that it's taking it over but it's like less of the place where we kind of add value</p>
</details>

我认为这象征着当技术颠覆对整个社会有利时，它会将人们推回到更具战略性的思维层面，并接管那些——你知道，它接管可能会让人感到害怕，但那并不是我们真正能增值的地方。

<p class="english-text">and so I think you know people need to be experimenting with these tools and starting to think about how it can liberate them to spend more time on the Strategic side the bigger the bird's eye view picture of of their work</p>
</details>

所以，我认为人们需要尝试使用这些工具，并开始思考它们如何能解放他们，让他们有更多时间投入到工作的战略层面，从更宏观的角度看待工作。

<p class="english-text">first of all I think realize that there's very very little chance that you're headed for a life where you're going to be doing the same thing for for decades over so you should be oriented toward learning growing that means continual experimentation that means broadening your your network</p>
</details>

David Epstein: 首先，我认为要认识到，你一生中几十年都做同一件事的可能性微乎其微，所以你应该以学习和成长为导向，这意味着持续的实验，意味着拓宽你的网络。

<p class="english-text">I would I would advise for someone in that age group of there were some cool kind of MIT research on this that because if you just let your social media go on its own kind of you'll end up following people who are all following each other basically so you'll have this real Echo chamber you should be constantly pruning and adding people who are more different from you to diversify the the sources of input</p>
</details>

我会建议那个年龄段的人，**麻省理工学院**有一些很酷的研究表明，如果你任由你的社交媒体发展，你最终会关注那些彼此关注的人，基本上你会有一个真正的回音室。你应该不断地修剪和添加那些与你更不同的人，以使你的信息来源多样化。

<p class="english-text">and I think you should be doing purposeful experimentation so I keep something I call a book of small experiments where every you know borrow from the scientific method say here's something I want to learn or here's something I want to learn about here's my hypothesis for how I'm going to do it here's how I'm going to evaluate the outcome and do that over and over and over and over</p>
</details>

而且我认为你应该进行有目的的实验。所以我保留了一个我称之为“**小型实验之书**”（Book of Small Experiments: 记录个人实验、假设、执行和结果的日志，用于指导学习和成长）的东西，每次都借鉴科学方法，说：“这是我想学习的东西，或者这是我想了解的东西，这是我如何做到的假设，这是我如何评估结果的方法。”然后一遍又一遍地这样做。

<p class="english-text">so you know to give a concrete example of something that's relevant to my life like I felt like I was stuck in a rut with writing I said I need to learn some new ways to structure writing because structuring information is the major challenge for me</p>
</details>

所以，举一个与我的生活相关的具体例子，我感觉自己在写作方面陷入了困境，我说我需要学习一些新的写作结构方式，因为信息结构化对我来说是一个主要挑战。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so I took a beginners I said well where's their more structure okay fiction so I took a beginner's course in fiction writing and it was a total Revelation for me</p>
</details>

所以我参加了一个初级课程，我说：“哪里有更多的结构？哦，小说。”所以我参加了一个小说的初级写作课程，这对我来说是一个彻底的启示。

<p class="english-text">like there was one exercise where we had to write stories with only dialogue and with no dialogue and the no dialogue one was so much better and I realized I had been overusing sort of dialogue I went back and changed it you know like basically every page of range</p>
</details>

比如有一个练习，我们必须只用对话来写故事，或者完全不用对话来写故事，结果不用对话的故事好得多，我意识到我过度使用了对话，所以我回去修改了它，你知道，基本上是《**范围**》的每一页。

<p class="english-text">and so I'm constantly doing these experiments where it's make a hypothesis find a way to test it reflect back on what you learned and take that forward</p>
</details>

所以我不断地进行这些实验，包括提出假设，找到测试方法，反思你学到了什么，然后将其付诸实践。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so I think more purposeful experimentation mindset is a really crucial one uh for you know and and may come naturally to some people who are just like incredibly curious but not to not to most people um</p>
</details>

所以我认为，更有目的性的实验心态是一个非常关键的因素，对于那些天生好奇心极强的人来说，这可能很自然，但对于大多数人来说则不然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I think it's really crucial in a world where like you should not be uh feeling entitled to stability of the thing that you're doing for years on end</p>
</details>

但我认为在一个你不能指望自己所做的事情能持续多年稳定的世界里，这真的至关重要。
