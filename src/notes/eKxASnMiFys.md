### 委内瑞拉的民主斗士：玛丽亚·科丽娜·马查多

主持人：玛丽亚·科丽娜·马查多，欢迎来到《All-In》访谈节目，感谢您今天与我在一起，并祝贺您两周前荣获**诺贝尔和平奖**（Nobel Peace Prize: 旨在表彰为促进和平作出杰出贡献的人士）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Maria Karina Machado, welcome to the all-in interview and thank you for being here with me today and congratulations on winning the Nobel Peace Prize two weeks ago.</p>
</details>

马查多：非常感谢您，大卫，这是我的荣幸。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Thank you very much, David. It's my pleasure.</p>
</details>

主持人：今天，您正处于藏匿之中。2023年10月，您赢得了委内瑞拉的**总统初选**（presidential primary election: 政党内部选出代表参加大选的候选人的选举）。去年3月，您被取消了参加大选的资格。您最终任命了代理人埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯。在总统大选投票结束后，您的政党提供了证据，声称您赢得了69.12%的选票，而马杜罗通过**全国选举委员会**（National Electoral Council: 委内瑞拉负责组织和监督选举的官方机构）宣布他以51%的选票获胜。这是关于**马杜罗政权**（Maduro regime: 尼古拉斯·马杜罗领导的委内瑞拉政府）以及之前的**查韦斯政权**（Chavez regime: 乌戈·查韦斯领导的委内瑞拉政府）及其对委内瑞拉人民影响的漫长故事的概述，您一直试图在全球舞台上揭示这些。我希望能为我们的观众，那些可能不太了解委内瑞拉历史的人，讲述一下这个故事，通过介绍这个国家的背景，以及您的童年和青年时期如何将您带到今天的舞台。请允许我冗长的介绍，但我认为让人们了解委内瑞拉在1914年发现石油后，于1922年真正开始的经济繁荣是很重要的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Today, you are in hiding. In October of 2023, you won the presidential primary election in Venezuela. Last March, you were disqualified from running in the general election. You appointed ultimately a surrogate Edmundo Gonzalez. After the vote for the general election for the presidency, your party presented evidence that claimed that you had won 69 12% of the votes while Maduro through the National Electoral Council declared that he was the winner with 51% of the votes. This is the recap of a very long story of the Maduro regime and prior to that the Chavez regime and its effect on the people of Venezuela which you have tried to bring to light on the global stage. I was hoping to frame up the story for our audience who may not know the history of Venezuela very well by talking a little bit about the background of the country and how your childhood and your youth brought you to the stage that you're on today and just to provide a little bit of background and forgive me for my lengthy introduction but I think it's important for folks to understand that the discovery of oil</p>
</details>

主持人：今天，委内瑞拉拥有3000亿桶已探明石油储量，位居世界第一。沙特阿拉伯以2660亿桶位居第二，美国则有480亿桶。在委内瑞拉发现石油后的几十年里，通过**七姐妹**（Seven Sisters: 指20世纪中期主导全球石油产业的七家跨国石油公司）石油公司的投资，经济最初有所改善，但最终该国转向了**石油国有化**（nationalize oil production: 将石油生产和相关产业的所有权和控制权从私人手中转移到国家手中），这导致了我们今天的故事。所以，玛丽亚·科丽娜，再次感谢您的到来。也许您可以告诉我们一些关于您青年时代的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> in Venezuela in 1914 began an economic boom that really kicked off in 1922. Today, Venezuela has proven oil reserves of 300 billion barrels, the number one proven oil reserve in the world. Saudi Arabia is number two at 266 billion and the US is at 48 billion. Over the decades that followed the discovery of oil in Venezuela, there was initially an improvement in the economy through the investment by the seven sisters which are a group of seven oil companies and ultimately there was a transition in the country to nationalize oil production and that led to I think the story that brings us here today. So Maria Karina again thank you for being here. Maybe you could tell us a little bit about your youth.</p>

### 马查多的成长与委内瑞拉的衰落

马查多：首先，我必须感谢您，因为这是委内瑞拉一个独特而决定性的时刻。我们在这场已经变成真正犯罪结构的暴政下生活了26年，它把曾经是美洲最自由、最富裕的国家之一，变成了最贫穷的国家之一，我们三分之一的人口被迫逃离。所以，想象一下这是多么大的悲剧，它表明，即使你拥有巨大的、独特的自然资源禀赋，但这并非财富本身；你需要人才、你需要制度、你需要自由，才能将其转化为人民的福祉。我出生在一个令人难以置信的家庭。我感谢上帝，因为我们有一个庞大的拉丁美洲式家庭，喜欢一直聚在一起。我的父亲是一位杰出的工业企业家。他可能是我一生中遇到过的最聪明、最慷慨、最诚实的人之一。他教导我们，伴随着家庭价值观和生活给予的机会而来的责任。这就是为什么我只想象我在委内瑞拉和自由中生活，我们带着这种责任感成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I have to thank you >> because this is a unique decisive moment in Venezuela. We've been under this tyranny that has turned into a real criminal structure for 26 years that have turned, you know, what used to be one of the freest and richest countries in the Americas into one of the poorest and with a third of our population forced to flee. So imagine what a tragedy it shows that you know you can have huge unique natural endowments but if but that's not uh wealth you need talent you need institutions and you need freedom in order to turn that in the well-being of your people I I I was born in an incredible family I I I thank the Lord because um we have a huge family like Latin American family like to be you together hanging around all the time. My father was an incredible industrial uh entrepreneur. He he is perhaps the smartest and most generous and honest individuals I've met in my life. And and he taught us the responsibility that comes with with that with your family values and the opportunity life gives you. And uh that's why we I only imagined my life in Venezuela and in freedom and and and we grew with that sense of responsibility.</p>
</details>

马查多：但说实话，我属于那一代人，你知道，他们对政治抱有排斥甚至蔑视。我说过我这辈子什么都做，就是不做政治。我们以为我们继承了民主，并且会永远拥有它。我们认为这是理所当然的。当查韦斯上台时，我们的生活被颠覆了，我们意识到，如果我们想自由生活，就需要行使公民权，这就是一切的开始。我从没想过我会坐在这里和您谈论政治或民主。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh but to be honest, I'm part of a generation that, you know, look politics with, you know, rejection or even contempt. I I said I would do anything in my life but politics. and um and and and and you know thought we thought that we had inherited democracy forever. We took it for granted and uh when Chavez arrived our lives were you know turned over and we realized that we we need to exercise citizenship if we wanted to live with freedom and that's how it all started. I never thought I would be sitting here with you talking about politics or democracy.</p>
</details>

主持人：我从没想过我会坐在这里录播客，但生活总会带我们走上奇怪的道路。查韦斯上台时，国家的情况如何？您当时过着怎样的生活？您在国家看到了什么，使得查韦斯能够上台？他又向人民承诺了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I never thought I would be sitting on a podcast, but uh you know, life takes us down strange paths. What were the conditions in the country when Chavez came to power? What sort of life were you living? What were you seeing in the country that enabled Chavez to come to power? And what did he promise the people?</p>
</details>

马查多：看，我们经历了一段民主时期，这给委内瑞拉带来了巨大的机遇，你知道，普及了教育和医疗。不幸的是，我们未能实现真正的自由经济。但国家对机构的控制，正如您所提到的，当石油公司被政府收归国有后，糟糕的激励机制开始出现，越来越多的人感到被社会财富所排斥，因为一切都掌握在国家手中。所以我们从未了解过国家控制经济以外的模式。我们一直以来只看到这种社会主义的运作方式。当查韦斯上台时，我们正经历一场政治危机，紧张局势日益加剧，政治体系和政党体系中也存在腐败。此外，油价也下跌了，大约每桶8美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, we had a period of of uh democracy that that brought Venezuela huge opportunities, you know, that uh widespread education and health. Unfortunately, uh we stopped short of a a real free economy. But um the state control not only of institutions but as you mentioned when the oil companies were you know owned turned into the government statized and and terrible incentives started being created and uh more and more people felt excluded from that you know wealth that the society Venezuelan society was getting or the country was getting because it was all in hands of the state. So we've never known but the state control economy. We've never always known or never seen anything but that kind of socialist uh procedures in place. When Travis arrived, we had gone through a political, you know, crisis and and and there were growing tensions and and, you know, planes are corruption in the political system, the party system. And also the price of oil had, you know, declined. It was around $8 a barrel. So</p>
</details>

马查多：所以他带着**民粹主义叙事**（populist narrative: 通过迎合大众情感、承诺简单解决方案来争取支持的政治话语）上台，承诺人人平等，并报复那些造成国家贫困的人。他与古巴的菲德尔·卡斯特罗等人物以及其他国际势力结盟，以攫取委内瑞拉的巨大资源。当然，委内瑞拉还拥有一个超级战略性的地理位置。他就是这样上台的，那个民粹主义体系先是变成了民主制，然后又演变成了犯罪结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> he came with a populist uh narrative offering, you know, everyone to be equal and and to revenge against all those that were guilty of of poverty in the the country. And and you know, he aligned with actors such as Fidel Castro in Cuba and other international interests to grab, you know, those huge resources Venezuela has. and of course in a you know super strategic geographic position. So that's how he got there and that populist system turned into a democratic and then into criminal structure</p>
</details>

主持人：他是在1999年上台的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and this was 1999 that he came to power.</p>
</details>

马查多：是的，那是在1999年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes, that was in 1999</p>
</details>

主持人：当时他上任时，油价大约是每桶14美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and at the time I think when he took office oil was at around $14 per barrel</p>
</details>

主持人：几年后，油价飙升到每桶100美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and a few years later oil spiked up to $100 per even.</p>
</details>

马查多：是的，是的，是的，没错。为了给这一切提供背景，在他上台之前，石油公司已经被国有化了。所以，正如您所说，政府实际上就是经济本身，他承诺这种平等和为所有委内瑞拉人民重新分配价值。他承诺的是这些吗？当时经济确实很萧条，因为油价很低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Just to contextualize all of this, prior to his coming to power, the oil companies had been nationalized. So to your point, the government was really the economy and he promised this sort of equality and redistribution of value for all of the people of Venezuela. Is that what he promised? And the economy was really depressed because of the oil price being down.</p>
</details>

马查多：是的，他承诺会从富人、公司那里获取资源，然后分配给贫困地区和社会中最脆弱的群体。最终，我们以惨痛的方式认识到，这种社会主义方法确实让每个人都陷入了绝对的贫困，因为生活中没有免费的东西。我的意思是，你放弃了你的选择、你的决定，表面上是为了获得什么，但实际上你得到的是一种奴役状态，国家为你做决定，只有当你表现得符合他们的要求时，你才能得到他们所承诺的。这就是我们现在看到的情况。大卫，想象一下，这个拥有世界最大石油储备的国家，我曾走过那些地下实际蕴藏石油的地区，你看到孩子们在垃圾堆里找食吃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. and that he would take, you know, uh, resources from the rich, the companies, and he would distribute in in in poor quarters and and in in in in the most vulnerable uh parts of the of society. And at the end, we we learned the hard way that effectively this kind of socialist approach does get everyone equal in absolute mystery because there's nothing for free in life. I mean you you give away your choices, your decisions. It's supposedly to receive what actually what you are you are getting is into a slave uh situation in which the state you know decides for you and and only if you behave accordingly you will get what they had offered. So that's what we're seeing right now. Imagine this David the country that has the largest oil reserves in the world. I've been walking around those areas where that oil is actually beneath the ground and you see children eating from garbage.</p>
</details>

主持人：所以，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So,</p>
</details>

马查多：这令人难以置信。我认为，正如您所指出的，我本来打算稍后提及，但西方、美国、欧洲可以从中吸取一个非常深刻的教训：社会主义就是奴役。我认为您带给世界的故事，就是这种社会主义暴政所驱动的奴役。没有社会主义就没有暴政。但我想稍微深入探讨一下，因为当查韦斯上台时，油价飙升到每桶100美元。突然间，委内瑞拉的石油储备让这个国家变得非常富有。然后他进行了一系列被一些人形容为“**石油外交**”（pro diplomacy: 指通过提供优惠的石油供应或援助来争取政治影响力）的行动，他每天以五折的价格向古巴人提供30万桶石油，以使古巴人成为代理人，也使加勒比海的其他岛国和非洲岛国成为代理人。委内瑞拉就是通过石油储备的力量来表达其全球政治影响力的，但这种方式排除了人民的参与。它似乎高度集中于政府。也许您可以分享一些关于查韦斯政府和军队中的人们如何过着奢华富裕的生活，而人民却日益贫困的故事。您能分享一些这方面的轶事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it's unbelievable. And I think to your point, and I was going to bring this up later, but there's such a powerful lesson to be learned for the West, for America, for Europe. Socialism is slavery. And I think the story that you bring to the world is one of slavery driven by this kind of socialist tyranny. There is no socialism without tyranny. But I just want to walk through that a little bit because as Chavez came to power, oil went up to $100 a barrel. Suddenly Venezuela's oil reserves made the country very wealthy. And he then engaged in a series of what some people have described to me as pro diplomacy where he gave away 300,000 barrels of oil per day to the Cubans at a 50% price discount in order to make the Cubans a surrogate in order to make other island nations in the Caribbean in the African island states surrogates. And that's how Venezuela expressed their political influence around the world was through the power of the oil reserves but in such a way that it excluded the people from participation. It seemed to be very centralized to the government. Maybe you could share a little bit about how folks in the government in the military under Chavez lived these incredible lives with wealth and luxury while the people were impoverished. Any anecdotes you could share on that?</p>
</details>

### 社会主义与暴政的代价

马查多：是的，当然。看，这是一个正在委内瑞拉和其他地方被尝试的侧面。你通过选举上台，然后从内部开始破坏每一个民主机构。你反对媒体，控制媒体，你可以在委内瑞拉看到这种模式。关于查韦斯如何开始施压或购买版面和宣传，然后购买整个媒体机构，通过审查制度，通过修改法律，使得公开发言变得非常非常危险。然后，这也延伸到了私营部门的每一个生产领域，当然也包括军队。我的意思是，所有那些最有能力的个人都被排挤到一边，只有那些绝对忠于政权的人才被提拔。所以，这就是你摧毁了功绩制度的方式，这样任何人都意识到，如果你想成为这个体系的一部分，如果你想为国家、学术界或军队工作，这与你的能力、知识或才能无关，你必须绝对忠诚，并向政权低头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure. Look, this is a this is this is a side that's being the, you know, tried in Venezuela and elsewhere. You get into power through elections and then from within you start undermining every single democratic institution. You go against the media, you control the media and it's and and you can see this pattern in Venezuela. about how Chavez started, you know, pressing or or buying space and publicity and then buying the whole media outlets and through censorship and and through and changing the laws in order for to be very very risky to speak out and and then it went also with the private sector in every single area of production and of course it took the military as well. I mean all those that were the most competent uh individuals that were put aside and only those that were absolutely loyal to the regime were offended. So this is and you destroy married merit at and and so that anybody uh realizes that if you want to be part of of the system, if you want to work for the state or or the academy or in the military, it has nothing to do with your competence or knowledge or talent, but you have to be absolutely loyal and and lower your head to the regime.</p>
</details>

马查多：而且，这逐渐地，想象一下所有涌入的资源，因为您说了一些非常重要但有些人没有意识到的事情。我的意思是，当查韦斯上台时，油价大约是10到8美元。后来飙升到每桶150美元。想象一下这笔巨大的资源。那是世界上所有的钱，他们有效地用它来收买忠诚，并在世界各地进行游说，支持遍布西半球和其他地方的意识形态团体。这些团体和这些，比如说，这些术语，他们相互联系。他们交流技术，交流信息，他们在国际论坛上相互支持。这就是为什么他们能在各自的领域和国家变得如此强大。另一方面，我们看到的是，我们这边的民主国家和民主运动非常孤立。我们没有像我们应该做的那样互相帮助，互相支持。我认为这是我们在这20年里学到的一个重要教训。关于资源的数量。看，有估计显示，委内瑞拉被掠夺的金额超过2万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and and this progressively imagine all the resources that were coming in because you you said something very important that some people do not realize. I mean the the the the the barrel of oil was around 10 or eight when Chavis arrived. It went up to $150 a barrel. Imagine the amount of resources. It was all the money in the world that they used effectively to buy loyal and and and to lobby around the world and to support ideological uh groups all over all over the the the western hemisphere and elsewhere. So and and these groups and these let's say these terms um get get in contact with each other. They exchange technology, they exchange information, they support each other in international forms. And that's why you know they get so powerful in their different uh areas and and and countries. On the other hand, what we had seen is that democracies and democratic movements in our in our side of the world are very isolated. We we don't help each other. We don't support each other as we should. I I think this is one of the great lessons that we've we've learned in these 20 years regarding the the the amount of resources. Look, there are estimates that the the the the the tag that the how Venezuela was robbed is over $2 trillion.</p>
</details>

马查多：想象一下我们在这26年里谈论的是什么。所有这些钱要么用于腐败，正如我所说，要么用于少数人积累的这种可耻的财富，而我们86%的人口现在生活在贫困中。委内瑞拉的养老金每月不到1美元。大卫，每月1美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Imagine what we're talking about in this 26 years. And uh and this was all either went for corruption as I said or for this kind of obscene uh fortunes this very few individuals have while 86% of our population nowadays lives in in poverty. The pensions in Venezuela are less than $1 a month. David $1 a month.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的。在查韦斯执政期间，还与毒品交易、**FARC**（FARC: 哥伦比亚革命武装力量，哥伦比亚最大的反政府游击队）、**ELN**（ELN: 民族解放军，哥伦比亚的另一支主要左翼游击队）等组织有联系。这种结盟的动机是什么？考虑到石油财富和因石油贸易而产生的国际外交关系，查韦斯政权以及现在的马杜罗政权为何还要与贩毒集团结盟？这种毒品联系的动机、诱因和驱动力是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And so under Chavez, there was also this embracing or tieup with the drug trade, the FARC, Elnia. What is the alignment? What was the reason that the Chavez regime and now the Maduro regime aligns with the drug cartels given the oil wealth, given the international diplomatic ties because of the oil trade? Why is there also a drug tie up and what is the motivation and the incentive and drive there?</p>
</details>

马查多：嗯，毒品生意并不是什么新鲜事。实际上，它在查韦斯上台之前就开始了，军队中的许多人都有与他们的联系。但他们意识到，利润甚至比石油还要大得多，这些犯罪结构中的个人贪婪是无限的。所以他们不仅涉足毒品走私，还涉足黄金走私、武器走私，甚至**人类贩运**（human trafficking: 指通过武力、欺诈或胁迫手段剥削他人的犯罪行为）。我的意思是，世界上每一个犯罪网络都汇聚到了委内瑞拉，委内瑞拉已经变成了西方和美国敌人的安全港。想象一下，加拉加斯距离迈阿密只有三个小时的路程。所以，在美洲心脏地带拥有俄罗斯、伊朗的卫星国，这是这些世界各地的政权一直梦寐以求的事情。甚至像**真主党**（Hezbollah: 黎巴嫩什叶派伊斯兰政治和准军事组织）、**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治和准军事组织）这样的恐怖组织，查韦斯和马杜罗曾向他们发放了数千份委内瑞拉身份证明和护照，让他们可以在世界各地自由旅行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, that that the Brock business isn't that new. Actually, it started before Charles arrived and many individuals in the military had had ties to them. But they realized it could be even much more uh uh the margins are even larger than than in oil and the greed in these individuals in this criminal structure is unlimited. It's infinite. So they not only went into drugs uh drug trafficking, they went into gold smuggling, arms smuggling, even human trafficking. I mean every single criminal network in the world has has you know converged into Venezuela that has been turned into a safe heaven for for the enemies of of of the West and and the enemies of the United States. Imagine I mean Karakas is three hours away from Miami. So having, you know, a satellite of Russia, of Iran operating in the heart of the Americas, it's it's something that, you know, this these regimes around the world had always dreamed of. Um even terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas uh to which Chavez and Maduro had given uh thousands of Venezuelan identities and passports to travel around freely around the world.</p>
</details>

主持人：在查韦斯执政期间，国内生产总值下降了70%。出现了大规模饥荒，犯罪率居世界之首，贫困率高达90%。您分享的许多故事和轶事都已被国际组织公开报道。查韦斯上台时您32岁。三年后，您成立了一个名为**Sumate**（Sumate: 西班牙语“加入”之意，委内瑞拉的一个公民组织）的公民组织。查韦斯上台时您的职业是什么？是什么促使您投身于公民参与，并一直坚持到今天？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So under Chavez, the GDP declined 70%. There was mass starvation, highest crime rates in the world, 90% poverty rate. Much of the stories and and anecdotes that you've shared have been reported publicly by international organizations. You are 32 years old when Chavez comes to power. 3 years later, you start a civil organization called Sumate. What were you doing when Chavez came to power professionally and what motivated you to get involved in the civic engagement that carried you forward to today?</p>
</details>

### 公民行动与政治觉醒

马查多：嗯，我一直在私营的汽车零部件和钢铁行业工作，追随我父亲的脚步，我也参与了一个**非政府组织**（NGO: Non-Governmental Organization，非政府组织），负责一个收容被遗弃和受虐儿童的庇护所。正如我所说，我从没想过我会涉足政治，但当这个人上台，并且我们清楚地看到他正在煽动国家分裂，制造紧张局势，甚至分裂家庭，包括我自己的家庭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I had been working in in the private uh auto parks and steel industry following my father's steps and um and also I was involved in a in a um in an NGO that took over a children shelter for abandoned and abused children and and and you know I as I say I'd never thought I would get involved into politics but once this you know this individual arrives and it's evident for us that he was promoting</p>
</details>

马查多：他的言论中充满了仇恨和暴力，他想在宗教、种族之间制造紧张。我们意识到那将对我们的国家造成严重伤害，一群工程师朋友决定，我们将努力收集**罢免公投**（recall referendum: 允许公民投票罢免已当选官员的程序）的请愿书。我们认为这将是一项超级简单的任务，在几周内就能收集到600万份请愿书，但我们以惨痛的方式认识到，这需要一种全新的公民组织方式。这就是Sumate的由来，Sumate的意思是“加入”。最终，我们设法在一天之内收集到了请愿书。数百万人走上街头签署了这些请愿书。这是一个漫长的故事。查韦斯最终在公投中舞弊，并继续掌权，随着时间的推移变得越来越专制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the division of our country to create tensions to to divide even families even my own family. >> Uh the degree of of hatred of violence in in his speech the way he he wanted to um to create tensions among religions, races. It it we realized that that was going to turn hard to our country and a group of friends engineers decided that we will work to to gather petitions for a recall referendum. We thought this was going to be like a super easy task to get you know 6 million uh petitions in a few weeks and and and you know we we learned the hard way. It was it would required a totally new uh kind of citizen organization. Uh and that's how subat means join up. Uh finally was managed to gather the the petitions in just one day. People millions of people came out and signed these petitions. It's a long story. Chavez eventually uh committed fraud in in the referendum and and stayed in power and and got even more and more autotocratic as the years passed by.</p>
</details>

主持人：那么，您是全职投入Sumate的工作吗？那是否成为了您当时毕生的事业？然后，您是如何决定竞选**国民议会**（National Assembly: 委内瑞拉的立法机构）的，那是在2011年，也就是Sumate成立9年后？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So were you doing Sumate full-time? Did that become your life's work at that point? And then how did you make the decision to run for the National Assembly which was in 2011? Fast forward 9 years after founding Sumate.</p>
</details>

马查多：Sumate对我以及许多委内瑞拉人来说，就像一次觉醒。我们意识到不能把公民权寄托在政党身上，如果你不愿意尽自己的一份力，就不能抱怨政治。这就是为什么有一天我说，看，我知道政治是如何运作的，我不喜欢它。所以如果我不愿意采取自己的行动，我就不能抱怨。所以我参加了耶鲁大学的一个领导力项目，那就像是从高处审视我的生活，我做出了一个重大决定，我要去争取。我要竞选国会议员。我没有政党。我没有经验。你知道，一切都不利于我。每个人都告诉我：“你疯了。你永远不会赢。你永远得不到支持。没有人会支持一个家庭有资源、一个女人、一个离异、不是社会主义者的人。”我的意思是，我具备所有失败的条件。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Sumate was like an awakening for me and for many Venezuelans. We we realized that we could not rely our citizenship in political parties and that you cannot be complaining about politics if you are not willing to do your part. And that's why you know it came a day when I say look you know I I I know how politics are doing how it works. I don't like it. So I cannot complain if I'm not willing to take my own steps. So I I took this fellowship to to to a program in of leadership at Yale University and and it you know it was like seeing my life from above and I made that huge decision that I was going you know go for it. I was I I was going to run for Congress. I had no political party. I had no experience. You know, everything was against me. Everybody told me, "You are crazy. You're never gonna win. You are never gonna get support. Nobody's going to support someone, you know, whose family has resources, who's a woman. You are divorced. You are not a socialist. I mean, I have every single condition to fail."</p>
</details>

马查多：我决定了，你知道，我觉得这是我的责任。我不能害怕，我必须相信自己的感觉，这令人印象深刻。你知道，志愿者开始联系我，在几个月内，没有任何资金、没有组织、没有媒体、什么都没有的情况下，我赢得了初选，然后我赢得了国民议会的选举。那是在2010年，我以委内瑞拉国会历史上最高的票数赢得了选举。

That was in 2010 and and then I won the the election with the highest number of votes in in Venezuelan Congress history.</p>
</details>

主持人：太棒了。互联网发挥了多大作用？我很久以前在**谷歌**（Google: 一家美国跨国科技公司，提供互联网相关服务和产品）工作，我们总是在讨论互联网将实现信息民主化，你不再需要通过媒体对信息进行集中控制，而在委内瑞拉，媒体实际上被一个想要掌权的政府所控制。互联网是否在2010年帮助您接触全国人民，从而成功当选？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Amazing. How much of a role did the internet play? I worked at Google a long time ago and we always had this conversation that the internet is going to create a democratization of information that you no longer had centralized control of information through media and in the case of Venezuela media that is effectively controlled by a government that wants to stay in power. Did the internet play a role in giving you the ability to reach people around the country in 2010 to be able to get elected?</p>
</details>

马查多：绝对如此。不仅如此，如果没有互联网，我在2010年就不会赢。

马查多：我的意思是，没有媒体敢采访我，而互联网是我们组织起来的方式，因为我们没有任何资源。但更进一步，让我告诉您，我知道人们对“坏人”和专制政权使用技术有很多担忧，委内瑞拉就是如何被渗透、迫害、操纵等等的典型案例。但如果没有技术，我们今天就不会站在这里，站在自由的门槛上。

### 国际舞台与政治迫害

主持人：所以您就像所有伟大的革命领袖一样，向权力说出真相。您现在在国民议会中拥有一席之地。然后在2014年3月，您在**美洲国家组织**（Organization of American States, OAS: 旨在促进美洲地区和平、安全与合作的国际组织）就委内瑞拉的人权问题发表了讲话。几天后，您被驱逐出议会，然后发生了一系列法律纠纷，我们无需深入探讨。但您能简单地描述一下当时发生了什么吗？您对他们说您不能再担任代表的这种转变有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So you are like all great revolutionary leaders speaking truth to power. You have a seat at the table now. You're in the National Assembly. And then in March of 2014, you address the Organization of American States about Venezuela's human rights. And then a few days later you were expelled from the assembly and then there was all this legal stuff that happened which we don't need to get into. But can you just frame up what happened in that moment kind of what your narrative is on the transition where they said you can no longer be a representative here anymore?</p>
</details>

马查多：嗯，我一年前就有过一次经历，因为我们参加了总统选举，在查韦斯去世后，我们击败了马杜罗，但他们舞弊了，我们无法证明我们赢了。那是在2013年4月，我回到国民议会。我站起来说：“马杜罗不是合法总统。我们赢了。”突然我听到有人叫我的名字。我转过身，看到这位恐怖主义政权的议员打了我一巴掌，她把我的鼻子打成了五块，我们被锁在国会里。我被扔到地上，被她踢打，而卡韦斯（指当时的国民议会主席）看着这一切。他是国民议会的主席。所以，这表明暴力已经失控。想象一下，如果他们能在电视上这样做。全国和全世界都通过电视看到了，而他们还在对我们大喊大叫。所以第二年我们开始了和平抗议，政权命令街上的年轻人，那些只是拿着牌子的人，被枪击。所以我去了美洲国家组织，那是马杜罗第一次在国际上被指控侵犯人权。我一回来，他们就把我赶出了国民议会，并强行禁止我回到我的座位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I had had a previous experience just one year before because we went for a presidential election and we won against Maduro when Chavez died and they they committed fraud and we weren't able to prove it that that we have won. And that was in in in in April 2013 and and I went back to the National Assembly. I stood up and I said, "Baduro is not the legitimate president. We won." And suddenly I hear someone calling my name. I turn around and there was this member of the parliament of the terrorista regime that hit me on in the face and she broke my nose in five pieces and uh and and and we were locked in in Congress. I were thrown to the floor. I was kicked by this and Cave was watching everything. He was the president of of the National Assembly. So this was, you know, an an evidence that violence had gotten out of control. Imagine if you can do that in a in a t TV. It was seen on TV uh throughout the the country and the world while they were shouting us. So next year we started peaceful protest and and um the regime ordered young people that were in the streets, you know, just with with with with plaques to be shot at. Uh so I went to the OAS, organization of American States, and it was the first time Vaduro was accused of human rights violations internationally. As soon as I came back, they they they they you know just ejected me from the National Assembly and by force prohibited me from going back into my seat.</p>
</details>

马查多：所以，那是一个非常艰难的时刻，但同时也是一个巨大的机会，因为我意识到我需要亲自接触我们的国家，并创建一个全新的组织来推广我们的理念，为斗争的下一个阶段做准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um it was a very hard moment but at the same time it was a great opportunity because I realized that I needed to reach out personally to to our country and create a totally new organization that promoted uh our ideas and prepared for the next stage of of the struggle</p>
</details>

主持人：这发生在2014年。您能分享一下马杜罗的过渡情况吗？从表面上看，马杜罗似乎不应该是查韦斯的自然继承人。他最初是一名公交车司机，后来成为工会领袖。从外部来看，不清楚是什么让马杜罗成为查韦斯选定的继承人。他作为一个人，他的性格中有什么特质使他成为查韦斯政权的继承人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and this was in 2014. Can you share about the Maduro transition? Maduro is on paper seemingly wouldn't have been the natural successor to Chavez. He started out as a bus driver and then he was a union leader. It's unclear from the outside what makes Maduro the the selected successor to Chavez. What is it about him as a man, as a person, his character that made him the successor to the Chavez regime?</p>
</details>

马查多：嗯，马杜罗是在古巴受训的。所以，是古巴人选择了马杜罗。对他们来说，这是一个非常简单的选择。他完全忠于共产主义的牧师式政权，马杜罗没有任何限制他行使暴力和武力来推行他的理念。他当然没有查韦斯的个人魅力，也没有对其他群体的控制力。所以他们正在建立一个由控制体系、战略、结构、军队、金融支持者、犯罪网络和政治部门的个人组成的群体。他就是这样一步步获得更多控制权，并将委内瑞拉变成了我之前提到的犯罪活动的安全港。他自己也成为了这些结构的头目。当我们听说**DEA**（Drug Enforcement Administration: 美国缉毒局）现在谈论的贩毒集团，即“儿子们”的贩毒集团时，我的意思是，这些都是我们多年来一直谴责的结构，我们曾试图让世界明白，这不再是一个传统的独裁政权，这是一个非常复杂的结构，它产生了巨额资源，不仅是为了他们自己，也是为了来自遥远地方的非常危险的盟友，比如我之前提到的那些，以及恐怖组织等等。他们把委内瑞拉变成了俄罗斯主要的军火买家之一，也是伊朗政权在海外的主要据点之一。我的意思是，他们利用委内瑞拉的金融系统来规避金融制裁，他们利用我们的领土自由运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, Maduro was trained in Cuba. So, it was the Cubans who chose Maduro. It was a a very easy option for them. totally loyal to the communist uh pastoral regime and um Budo has no no you know no nothing restricts him from exercising you know violence and and and and force for his uh ideas and he certainly doesn't have chavis charisma uh nor not nor not the the degree of control in in the other groups so they were creating you know, like a group of of of of uh individuals that that the control of the of of the the system, the strategy, the the structure that control the military, the financial enablers, uh the uh criminal networks and the political sectors. And that's how he he went over taking more and more control and turning Venezuela, as I mentioned before, into this safe heaven of criminal activities. and he himself turned into the head of these structures when we heard about the deawa now about the cartel loles the cartel of the sons I mean these are structures that we have denounced for years and we have tried the word to understand that this was not a conventional dictatorship anymore this is a you know a very complex structure that that you know produces obscene amounts of resources uh not only for them but also for very dangerous allies that come from very far such as the ones I mentioned before and terrorist groups and so on. They you know they turned Venezuela into one of of the Russians main buyers of of of uh army and and and weapons and uh also one of the the I would say the the major stronghold of the Iranian regime abroad. I mean they use Venezuelan financial system to bypass financial sector, financial sanctions and and they use our territory to to operate freely.</p>

### 委内瑞拉的国际关系：古巴、俄罗斯、伊朗与中国

主持人：那中国呢？您能分享一些关于中国与马杜罗领导下的委内瑞拉领导层的关系，以及这种经济联系何时变得更加密切吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And what about China? Can you share a little bit about China's relationship with Venezuelan leadership in Maduro and when that became an more kind of intimate economic tie?</p>
</details>

马查多：嗯，委内瑞拉最终成为了中国的主要债务国，欠债超过600亿美元，这些债务用于各种从未建成的项目。当然，中国也意识到委内瑞拉的自然资源禀赋是独一无二的，具有战略意义。尽管如此，这个体系中的腐败程度如此之高，以至于中国在大约七年前停止了对马杜罗的资助，现在只是通过石油来偿还那些悬而未决的债务。我相信中国理解委内瑞拉的战略重要性，也包括其地理位置。但由于马杜罗及其政权造成的腐败程度，中国变得更加谨慎。不过，还有另一方面，那就是中国在委内瑞拉安装的情报、间谍、技术和卫星。这对他们来说也是一个非常重要的维度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Venezuela turned out to be uh China's main uh um debtor with over 60 60 billion uh dollars in in depths that uh you know accounted for all kinds of different projects that were never built and uh and and certainly China realized that Venezuela's you know natural endowments are unique absolutely unique it strategical. Um, nonetheless, uh, the the degree of corruption in the system and in this system is so so big that China stopped funding Maduro about seven years ago and simply is getting, you know, the oil to to pay for the debts that are still um pending. Um, I I I believe China, you know, understands the the the strategic importance Venezuela has also for its geographic location. Um, but but has been more prudent because of the degree of of corruption that they have suffered from for Maduro and and the regime. But there's al also the side of the if you know the intelligence uh espionage uh and technology and satellites from China that have been installed in Venezuela. That's a very important dimension for them as well.</p>
</details>

### 人口外流与社会困境

主持人：委内瑞拉是一个大约2800万人口的国家。据一些估计，有800万人逃离了该国。您认为这个数字准确吗？您能提供一些关于人们为何离开、他们去了哪里，以及该国导致人口大规模外流的情况的轶事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Venezuela is a country of I think 28 million people. By some estimates 8 million people have fled the country. Does that feel accurate to you? Can you provide some anecdotes of why people leave, where they go, and what it's like in the country that's causing this mass exodus of the population?</p>
</details>

马查多：看，我们是一个略多于3000万人口的国家。我的意思是，这是一个你完全没有任何信息的国家。想象一下生活在一个你不知道自己有多少人、不知道债务规模、不知道国内生产总值或通货膨胀率的国家。什么都不知道。它是一个黑箱。你知道，这也是未来挑战的一部分，但大约有900万人离开了，这大约是我们人口的30%。想象一下，如果30%的美国人离开，那意味着什么？不，这是毁灭性的，因为我们看到我们的年轻人、我们的孩子、医生、工程师、科学家、护士、教师都离开了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look, we are the nation of little over 30 million. I mean, this is a country where you have no information whatsoever. Imagine living in a country where you know how many you are. You don't know what's the the size of your debt or your GDP or or inflation. Nothing. It's a black box. you know that's that's that's why it's also a challenge in terms of what's coming up but um roughly 9 million people have left it is you know around 30% of our population imagine if a 30% of American people leave what it would mean no it's devastating because we're seeing you know our young people our children doctors engineers scientists nurses teachers</p>
</details>

马查多：当然，他们离开是因为经济状况非常糟糕，但更主要的是因为你在这个国家看不到未来，因为你觉得没有生存的可能。所以，有母亲留下年幼的孩子，只为给他们寄点吃的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course they go because the situation from an economic perspective is is horrible but mostly because you don't see a future in your country because you feel there's no possibility to survive. So women that have left their young children back only to send something for them to eat.</p>
</details>

马查多：有孩子留下年迈的父母独自一人。我见过太多太多的祖父母，他们还没有见过自己的孙辈，他们哭着拥抱我，请求我，请把我的孙辈带回来。我们都知道，唯一能实现这一点的可能性就是我们向民主过渡。当那一天到来时，大卫，你会看到马杜罗下台的那一天，成千上万的委内瑞拉人会自愿回来，尽管他们知道那将是一个艰难的时刻，我们将不得不非常努力地工作，但我们知道那个独特的潜力，你知道，他们想成为其中的一部分。对我们来说，这不仅仅是一场政治斗争，它是一个民族的生存斗争，也是一场精神斗争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Children that have left their parents alone. I I've met so many so many grandparents that have not met their grandchildren yet and and they cry and hug me and ask me please please bring my grandchildren back and we all know that the only possibility for that to happen is that we you know have a transition to democracy and when that happens David you will see the day Maduro goes hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans voluntarily coming back even though they know it's a hard moment that we'll have you know to work really hard but we we know the potential that unique potential and and you know they want to be part of this it's much more than a political struggle for us it's an existential struggle as a nation and also spiritual struggle as well</p>
</details>

### 马杜罗政权的压制手段

主持人：很多人会问，为什么他们今天不走上街头？您能谈谈马杜罗政权的恐吓手段，以及为什么人们很难像我们历史上在世界各地看到的其他革命那样奋起反抗？是什么阻止了这种情况的发生？马杜罗政权用来维持权力的机制是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> a lot of people will say why don't they go on the streets today can you talk a little bit about the intimid imidation of the Maduro regime and why it's so difficult for people to rise up in the way that we have seen other revolutions historically around the world. What keeps that from happening? What are the mechanisms that are used to stay in power uh by the Maduro regime?</p>
</details>

马查多：看，我们在委内瑞拉也多次看到这种情况。我的意思是，我们谈论的是数千次的抗议、和平集会，成千上万甚至数十万人走上街头。但这个政权，马杜罗政权，已经发展出古巴情报机制，用于渗透，任何走上街头的人都会被拘留、伤害、杀害或失踪。去年7月28日我们赢得选举时，成千上万的人走上街头，当时我们正在计票，我稍后会告诉您更多。在短短24小时内，2500人被捕入狱，其中包括年轻人、儿童、妇女，她们甚至遭到性侵犯和虐待，仅仅因为她们走上街头和平地要求尊重她们的**人民主权**（popular sovereignty: 指政府的合法性来源于人民的同意和授权）权利。但他们做得更过分了，大卫。他们去了我们那些负责选举、担任证人、保管计票单的活动家的家中，把他们带走了。如果他们不在家，他们就会抓走他们的家人，他们的母亲、孩子、伴侣，任何一个甚至在他们的Instagram或X账户上发布我照片的人，他们也会去抓走。所以这太残忍了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look, and and we have seen that in Venezuela many times as well. I mean, we're talking about thousands of times in protests, in peaceful, you know, rallies, in people going out by by tens of thousand and even hundreds of thousands. But the regime has developed, this regime, Maduro, with the Cuban intelligence mechanisms to infiltrate and anyone who goes out is either detained, harmed, killed, disappeared. When we won the election last year in July 28, thousands of people went to the streets while we were counting the votes, which I want to tell you a little bit more ahead. And you know in a matter of 24 hours 2500 people were in prison including young people, children, women that were even sexually assaulted, abused just because they had gone out to the streets to peacefully claim for their right for popular subject sovereignty to be respected. But they went beyond that, David. They went to the houses of our of our of our activists that had been taking care of the election that that work as witnesses that take took care of the town sheets and and and they took them away. And if they weren't there, then they would grab their families, their mothers, their children, their their couples, and uh and and every single person who even posted my picture on their on their, you know, Instagram account for X account, whatever, they would go and take them as well. Uh so it was so brutal</p>
</details>

马查多：**美洲人权委员会**（Inter-American Commission of Human Rights: 美洲国家组织下属机构，负责促进和保护美洲地区的人权）将其标记为**国家恐怖主义**（state terrorism: 指国家通过暴力、恐吓和压迫手段来控制人民或反对异见），联合国的事实调查团称这些是**反人类罪**（crimes against humanity: 国际法中指对平民人口进行广泛或系统性攻击的特定行为）。它的范围如此之广，如此系统化，他们想要恐吓整个社会。

马查多：他说我将在监狱里度过余生。有些人认为情况会更糟。但是，你知道，我的整个团队，他们管理了这场令人难以置信的竞选活动，现在要么在监狱里，要么不得不离开这个国家。所以，这是一个恐惧被残酷武力强加的时刻，但这并不意味着委内瑞拉社会被压制了，因为我们成功地组织了一场令人难以置信的史诗般的事件，我们赢得了选举。现在我们一直在地下组织，为民主过渡的那一天做准备，人民将确保这是一个有序的过程。

### 回应“西方傀儡”指控与委内瑞拉的未来

主持人：马杜罗曾多次公开表示，您是西方的傀儡，美国及其盟友试图干预委内瑞拉政治，因为他们对委内瑞拉的石油储备有经济利益。我想给您一个机会回应这些说法。我认为您在强调自己的动机和实地经验方面做得非常出色，但是，我们能否反驳或讨论这种观点？顺便说一句，许多人之所以持有这种观点，是因为美国在中东和中东政治中的介入，以及美国在非石油富裕国家政治中的缺席。也许我们可以谈谈这对西方的重要性，不仅仅是经济利益，还有什么其他因素在推动这一切，以及美国为什么有兴趣支持您的事业？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Maduro has publicly said many times that you are a puppet of the west that the US and its allies are trying to interfere in Venezuelan politics because of their economic interest in the Venezuelan oil reserves. I want to give you a moment to respond to those claims. I think you've done an amazing job highlighting your motivation and the on the ground experience, but um can we counter or have a conversation about this belief which by the way many have made because of the US involvement in Middle East and Middle East politics and the US's absence of involvement in politics in countries that are not oil rich. Maybe we could talk a little bit about the the importance of this for the West. not just the economic interest but you know what else is motivating this and why is the US interested in supporting your cause</p>
</details>

马查多：这种说法并不新鲜。我的意思是，所有这些人都会对任何敢于发声的人说同样的话，即使那是一个工会领袖、学生或牧师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that claim is not very original I mean that's what all of these guys say to anyone that speaks out if even if it's you know a a a union leader student or a priest</p>
</details>

马查多：坦率地说，我根本不在乎他们说什么。我们知道我们是谁，我们相信什么，以及人们为什么信任我们。我们成功地建立了我国历史上最强大的公民运动。从2023年开始，当委内瑞拉看起来绝望、分裂、没有前进的机会时，我们接触了每一个人。我走遍了我的国家的每一个角落。看，我开车去的，因为我已经有12年多被禁止离开委内瑞拉了。我甚至不被允许购买国内航班机票。所以他们以为他们在伤害我，但实际上他们给了我最大的机会，让我能够走遍我的国家，从一个地方到另一个地方，与人们交谈，倾听，学习，理解，真正地接近我们所处的境地和我们所相信的，打破政权为分裂我们而设置的障碍，并发现这无关左右，无关贫富，无关肤色。这关乎人类尊严。这关乎尊重、团结、合作、自由和爱，爱是把我们凝聚在一起的最强大的力量。你知道，我见过那些多年来亲近查韦斯主义的人来到我身边，哭泣，拥抱我，请求原谅，我说：“不，我没有什么可原谅的。”你知道，我们现在有一个共同的目标。我们有一个共同的愿景。我们都希望我们的孩子回来。这正是现在正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and frankly you know I couldn't care less what they say you know we know what we are what we believe and what the people and why people trust us. We have managed to build the strongest citizen movement in our country's history. Starting on 2023 when Venezuela looked hopeless and divided and without a chance to move ahead, we reached out to every single I went to every single corner of my country. Look, I went with my car because I've been banned from living Venezuela for over 12 years. I'm not even allowed to buy a a local flight ticket. So they thought they were hurting me, but actually they they gave me that biggest opportunity to to to to you know go through my country from one point to the other and to talk to people to listen to learn to understand to get really close in terms of what we are in what we believe to turn down those barriers the regime had built to divide us and to find out that this is not about left or right or poor, black or white. It is about human dignity. It's about respect, solidarity, cooperation, freedom, and love and love, which is the strongest force that has brought us together. You know, I've seen people that were close to the Chadista for years coming to me, crying, hugging me, asking for forgiveness, and I said, "No, I have nothing to forgive." You know, we have a common goal now. We have a common vision. We all want our kids back all. And that's precisely what's happening right now.</p>
</details>

马查多：所以，看，对我来说，委内瑞拉是拥有最大机遇的国家，不仅对美国和西方其他国家而言。我的意思是，想象一下，我不是在谈论我们巨大的自然资源禀赋，我们已经讨论过了，也不是我们的基础设施，甚至不是我们的地理位置。而是我们的人民，我们所承受的一切，以及我们团结起来的方式。我最近听到一些人说，你知道，一旦马杜罗下台，因为他很快就会离开，就会有内战或动乱的风险。别开玩笑了。我们谈论的是一个90%人口都想要同样东西的国家。没有宗教差异。没有种族紧张，没有社会或政治差异。我们都想要同样的东西。我们为自由奋斗了如此之久，我们是那些能够保证这将是一个有序过渡的人。是的，我们与美国的价值观和文化非常接近。是的，我们是。我们钦佩一个拥有强大民主制度、为自己的成就、历史和遗产感到自豪的国家，我们也是如此。所以，看，现在这种社会主义的言论在委内瑞拉是毫无用处的。你知道，我们只了解社会主义，而今天的委内瑞拉，我相信，大多数人拥抱开放市场、尊重私有财产、功绩和合作。

It's our people what we have endured and the way we have come together. And I've heard recently some people talking about that you know once Madura goes out because it will leave soon you know there's this risk of of you know um civil war or unrest. Give me a break. We're talking about a country where 90% of the population we all want the same. There are no religious differences. There are no racial tensions, no social or political differences.

And yes, we are close to the United States values and culture. Yes, we are. We admire a nation that has strong democratic institutions that feel proud for for their achievements, their history, their legacy and so are we. So look, you know those kind of of socialist rhetoric nowadays is useless in Venezuela. You know, we have only known socialism and Venezuela today is a country I believe that you know most people embrace open markets, respect for private property, merit and collaboration.</p>

### 2023年大选：一场史诗般的胜利与舞弊

主持人：我想先谈谈选举，然后我想问您对今天美国的看法。但我们先谈谈选举。两年前您竞选总统。您在2023年10月26日的初选中取得了压倒性的胜利。今天，您却身处地下室。您没有在总统办公室。我们能回顾一下发生了什么吗？那场竞选活动是怎样的？鉴于您无法接触到国家媒体，您是如何接触到人民的？然后也许可以分享一些关于那次初选胜利以及之后发生的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I want to just talk about the election and then I'd like to ask your view on the United States today. But let's talk about the election. Two years ago you ran for president. You won the primary with a resounding victory in October 26, 2023. Today, you're sitting in a basement. You're not in the office of the president. Can we walk through what happened? What was that campaign like? How did you reach the people given that you didn't have access to the state media and then maybe share a little bit about that primary victory and what happened afterwards?</p>
</details>

马查多：是的，你知道，正如我所说，我们在2023年1月意识到，我们需要重新获得信任，委内瑞拉人民需要信任自己，也需要相互信任。初选提供了一个绝佳的机会，将权力交还给人民，而不是像过去那样由政党来决定候选人。所以我们决定推动一场初选，一场政权不会介入的初选。在委内瑞拉，过去的初选过程是由政权选举实体组织的，我们说这次不行，我们将由公民自己组织。这是一个巨大的挑战和巨大的风险，我们相信政权完全低估了我们。他们以为可能只有10万、20万人会出来投票，所以他们就放任自流。当10月22日，也就是两年前的今天，他们来了，我是一名候选人，有10位候选人，我想，这简直是个奇迹，这一切正在发生，正如我们所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, you know, we realized as I said in in January 2023 that we need needed to get, you know, trust back, you know, Venezuelan people, trust ourselves and trust each other and and the primary had this incredible opportunity of giving power to the people and not the political parties that used to decide, you know, which the candidates were. So we decided to push for a primary and a primary in which the regime would not get involved. Uh in in Venezuela in previous primaries process the the the regime electoral uh or uh entity would organize primaries and we said this time no way we're going to do it organized by citizens. It was a huge challenge and a great risk and we believe the regime totally underestimated us. They thought that perhaps, you know, 100 200,000 people might appear and vote and so on and and that's why they they let it go, let it run. And when October 22nd, you know, it's two years ago exactly, they came, I was a candidate, there were 10 candidates, and I thought, well, it's a miracle that that it's just this is happening as we as as as we're seeing it.</p>
</details>

马查多：上午10点或11点左右，我开始接到来自全国各地的电话，说：“我们选票用完了。”我说：“什么意思？才过了3个小时，选票就用完了？”有300多万委内瑞拉人前来投票。大卫，这是一个多么勇敢的行为，因为走出来投票就意味着你在投票给反对派。不。所以这意义重大。我指的是那些偏远城镇，我们需要用河船才能拿到结果，还有世界各地的委内瑞拉人，因为我坚持，我们许多人都坚持，不应该允许海外的委内瑞拉侨民投票。所以那天，我们的国家团结起来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At mid morning around 10 or 11 in the morning, I start getting calls from all around the country saying, "We run out of ballots." I said, "What do you mean? I mean, it's only 3 hours of of the process. What do you mean we run out of ballots?" So many people showed up. Over 3 million Venezuelans. And it was such a courageous act, David, because going out meant that you were voting for the opposition. No. So this was huge. I'm talking about remote towns that we need to have river boats in order to get the results and and also Venezuelans around the world because I insisted and many of us that Venezuelans abroad our diaspora shouldn't be allowed to vote. So that day our country came together.</p>
</details>

马查多：我感到谦卑，我心存感激。我获得了92%的选票，马杜罗意识到他们无法阻止我。所以，他们禁止我参选。我向您坦白，那是我生命中最艰难的日子之一，因为这太不公平了。我的意思是，我有一个授权，但你知道，我本可以毁掉一切，但我决定不，我们必须继续前进，我们必须找到一个愿意取代我的人。政权再次低估了我们，因为他们接受了一位74岁的外交官，没有人知道他是谁。一个超级诚实、忠诚、聪明、善良的人，但没有人知道他是谁。他就是埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I I I I am humbled. I am grateful. I I got 92% of the votes and and Maduro realized that, you know, they they wouldn't be able to stop me. So, they they banned me from participating. Confess to you that it was one of those really tough days in your life because it was so unfair. I mean, I had a mandate, but you know, I could have blown everything, but I decided, no, we have to keep on going, and we're gonna have find someone that is willing to take my place. And once again, the regime underestimated us because they accepted a 74 year old diplomat that nobody knew who he was. A super honest, loyal, intelligent, good person, but no one knew who he was. This is Edmundo Gonzalez.</p>

主持人：埃德蒙多。

马查多：没错，埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯当选。我有一张印着他头像的海报。所以我走遍全国，告诉人们，如果你想投票给我，你必须投票给他。他就是那个人。同时，请记住，我们已经经历了30多次选举，这些选举越来越频繁地出现舞弊。我的意思是，抱歉。埃德蒙多·冈萨雷斯，他是在2024年7月，去年夏天成为您的候选人，对吧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Exactly. Edmundo Gonzale elect. And uh I had a poster with his face. So I went all over the country telling if you want to vote for me, you have to vote for him.

Ed Mundo Gonzalez, he became your candidate in July of 2024, last summer, just to be clear, right?</p>

</details>

马查多：所以，想象一下，当时，我的意思是，没有人知道候选人是谁，我们所有人都知道我们正在面对世界上最欺诈的系统。我的意思是，欺诈性选举的概念，已经在世界各地蔓延开来，它就诞生在委内瑞拉，伴随着**电子投票机**（electronic machines: 用于记录和计算选票的电子设备）以及他们围绕它创造的所有东西。恐惧、操纵、篡改登记等等。所以我们意识到我们需要利用技术为我们服务，这就是为什么我们成功地创建了一支志愿者大军。

<p class="english-text">>> So, imagine at this time, I mean, nobody knew who the candidate was >> and we everybody knew we were facing the most fraudulent system in the world. I mean the concept of of fraud collections that are been spreading around the world, it was born here in Venezuela with the electronic machines and all the the stuff they've been creating around it. Fear, manipulation, altering their register and so on. So we realized that we needed to use technology in our favor and that's why we managed to create a legion</p>
</details>

马查多：我们在政权没有察觉的情况下训练了他们。有5000场现场培训，超过30万人通过互联网接受了培训。我们开发了手机应用程序，通过它我们可以监控全国的每一个投票站。

<p class="english-text">>> How many people did you recruit to this legion for the ballot monitoring?</p>
</details>

马查多：最终超过100万志愿者。每个人都有一个具体的任务。大卫，我们没有钱。我们不能印刷传单或海报。你知道我们的宣传预算是多少吗？零。我们没有为任何一个广告付费。什么都没有。当我们走遍全国，住在酒店时，政权第二天就会来关闭酒店。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> It ended up being more than 1 million volunteers. Everyone with a specific task. David, we had no money. We could not print flyers or posters. You know how much was our uh publicity budget? Zero. We didn't pay for one ad. Nothing. When we went around the countries and we stayed in hotels, the regime would come the next day and close a hotel.</p>
</details>

马查多：如果我们停在街上买些食物，他们就会惩罚那家餐馆或小吃店。我的意思是，他们封锁街道。他们把我们的人关进监狱，迫害那些负责选举和组织部门的人。我的意思是，这规模巨大。但他们把这变成了一场史诗。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If we went and stopped in the street to to buy some food, then they will punish the the the restaurant or or the snack place. I mean, they they blocked streets. They they got our people in in prison, persecuted those that were in control of the electoral and and organization departments. I mean, this was huge. But they turned this into an epic</p>
</details>

马查多：公民们决定这将是他们自己的史诗，他们自己的胜利。所以我们与我们的**侨民**（diaspora: 指因各种原因离开祖国，散居在世界各地的群体）一起训练了所有这些人。我们设计了这个应用程序。我们知道，这是一个非常重要的部分，我们必须第一次证明我们的胜利。我们需要证明结果。所以我们设计了一个系统，通过它我们可以收集原始的投票单。我们会扫描它们，并将其发布在一个强大的数字化网页上，供全世界查看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and citizens decided that it was going to be their own epic, their own victory. So we train all these people with our diaspora. We we we had this app uh designed and we knew and this is a very important part that we had to prove our victory for the first time. We needed to prove the results. So we designed a a system through which we would collect the original poly sheets. We would scan them and we will publish them in a digitized web page super robust for the whole world to see.</p>
</details>

马查多：为了做到这一点，想象一下，我们身处一个60%的领土没有互联网甚至手机信号的国家。所以我们需要进行地理优化，你知道，处理中心来处理这些实体选票，我们做到了。我们走私了**星链**（Starlink: 埃隆·马斯克的SpaceX公司运营的卫星互联网星座）和天线进入该国，还有发电机、笔记本电脑、手机，在政权没有察觉的情况下，我们安装了130个运营地点。在不到24小时内，我们能够通过原始的计票单图像来证明我们的胜利，这些图像被全世界看到和审查。它们经过了20多个不同的独立技术人员和大学的审计，他们都得出结论，这些是真实的结果。所以老实说，我认为我们确实为选举诚信树立了新标准，不仅在独裁国家，甚至对民主国家也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in order to do this, imagine we are in a country where 60% of our territory doesn't have access to the internet or even cellular phones. So we needed to geotoptimize, you know, process h centers to process the the physical sheets and we did that. We smuggled Starlink and uh antennas into the country, generators, laptops, cell phones, and without origin noticing it, we we we installed these 130 operational places. And in less than 24 hours we were able to prove our victory with the you know the images original images of the talifits being seen and scrutinized by the whole world. They were audited by over 20 different independent technicians and universities and they all concluded that those were the real results. So to be honest, I think we do have set a new standard for electoral electoral integrity, not only in dictatorships, even in even for democracies.</p>

### 委内瑞拉的下一步与国际支持

马查多：看，这条路很漫长。我的意思是，我有很多同事和朋友目前身陷囹圄，他们身在远方，甚至被杀害。我的意思是，这非常痛苦，但同时，我们也成长了很多。我的意思是，我们是一个不同的社会，我们也是不同且更好的人。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Look, it's been such a long way. I mean, it's have so many colleagues and friends that are currently in jail that are very far away or even killed. I mean, this has been very painful, but at the same time, we have grown so much. I mean, we're a different society, but also we're different and better individuals.</p>
</details>

马查多：我们学会了生活在民主和自由中的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've learned the value of living in democracy and being free.</p>
</details>

马查多：现在我们已经走了这么远。我们在委内瑞拉人民的心中击败了马杜罗。我们在投票箱中击败了马杜罗。我们在委内瑞拉的精神中击败了马杜罗。现在他只剩下暴力，以及少数高层人物和金融支持者，他们恐吓着那些仍在支持他的军人。但是，你知道，这过去的15个月的韧性和抵抗，从内部产生了越来越大的压力，现在我们终于看到了来自外部的反应。多年来，我们一直要求世界理解这是一个犯罪结构。因此，为了打破它，你需要切断来自贩毒、黄金走私、人口贩运或石油黑市的犯罪资金流入。你需要切断这些流入。这正是唐纳德·特朗普总统现在正在做的事情。我们非常感谢看到这个国际联盟正在对这个犯罪结构实施法律，这是我们所需要的。我的意思是，马杜罗这么多年来一直觉得他可以毫无代价地让人们失踪、杀害、折磨。有罪不罚的时代已经结束了，我相信这个政权正处于有史以来最虚弱的境地。他们明白这是严重的。存在真正的威胁，我们正在看到叛逃、背叛，以及越来越多来自政权内部的人与我们联系。我们说的是，看，我们曾提供过一个谈判过渡的可能性，现在那扇门已经关闭，我们向所有决定站在法律一边的人提供，他们可以成为委内瑞拉这场巨大变革的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh now we've come such a long way. We defeated Maduro in the hearts and minds of the Venezuelan people. We defeated Maduro in the ballot boxes. We defeated Maduro in the spirit of Venezuela. And now the only thing he's got left is his, you know, violence. and a few uh top brass individuals and financial enablers that have terrified those uh in the military that still are you know supporting him. But you know these last 15 months of resilience and resistance have created more and more pressure from within and now finally we're seeing a reaction from abroad. For years, we have asked the world to understand that this is a criminal structure. And as such, in order to to break it down, you need to cut the inflows of criminal money that comes from drug trafficking, from gold smuggling, for human trafficking, or or the black market of oil. You need to cut those inflows. And that's precisely what President Trump is doing right now. and and and we are very grateful to see this uh international coalition that is applying you know the law the enforcement of the law on this criminal structure which is what we need. I mean Badudo for so so this long years have felt uh that he could you know disappear, kill, torture people with absolute zero zero cost. the timing of impunity has ended and um and and you know I I believe the regime is its weakest position ever. They understand this is serious. there is a you know a real threat and we are seeing defections uh betrayals and more and more people from within the regime reaching to us and what we're saying is look we had offer a possibility of a negotiated transition and now that that day is closed we offer you know everybody that decide to step on the side of the law that they can be part of this huge transformation of Venezuela.</p>

马查多：我不得不说，我们得到了两党的支持，您甚至昨天在国会也看到了这一点，因为参议院和众议院都有明智的个人，他们明白，这不仅是出于人道主义原因，因为委内瑞拉有数百万人的生命处于危险之中，而且也是为了美国的国家安全。我认为这一点在目前已经得到了很好的证明。但是到目前为止，只有言语，只有声明，没有行动。当你面对一个犯罪政权时，你必须明白，实现和平的途径是通过自由，而自由需要力量，那是道德力量、精神力量和身体力量，这正是政权目前所面临的。所以，你知道，我们非常非常感谢特朗普总统和他的政府，感谢他富有远见和果断的行动，直言不讳。这需要勇气。以前没有多少人愿意这样做。所以现在，看，我们已经准备好了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Do have to say that, you know, we've had bipartisan support and you see that in Congress even yesterday, you know, and and and because they're, you know, sensible individuals in the Senate, in the House that understand that it's, you know, it's for humanitarian reasons because of its millions of lives at risk in Minnesota, but it's also for the national security of the United States. I think that's, you know, it's pretty well proven at this point. Um, but so far, um, there were only words, only statements and no actions. And and when you face a criminal regime, I you have to understand that you know the way to reach peace is through freedom and freedom requires strength and that is moral strength, spiritual strength and physical strength and and that's what finally the regime is facing at this point. So you know we're very we are very very grateful to President Trump and his administration for you know the visionary and decisive way he has act calling things by their names. It requires courage. Not a lot of people were willing to do that before. So now look, we are prepared</p>

But our people are tougher and stronger than ever and we are determined to be free. So, this is going to be like it's going to be a rebirth. We're going to turn Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into the energy hub, the technology hub and the democracy hub of the Americas. And and it we will need to do that from from from scratch, from ruins. But uh but you know we have our huge incredible diaspora that are willing to come back and imagine you know with all the resources we have you know the energy that the capacity to to produce energy not only natural gas and hydroele electricity solar and so on you know we can we're going to be so attractive for uh uh for those who want to invest as I said not only in energy but in technology AI data centers.

### 给美国青年的警示：社会主义的教训

主持人：在我们结束之前，玛丽亚·科丽娜，我想问您一个重要问题，那就是我们正在看到美国历史上前所未有的对社会主义的兴趣增长，这在很大程度上是由于一些人认为具有挑战性的收入增长状况和学生贷款债务。我的意思是，这与委内瑞拉的情况非常不同，但许多美国中产阶级孩子发现自己无法像他们之前的每一代人那样进步。在美国历史上，他们似乎无法为自己创造比父母更好的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And before we wrap, Maria Karina, I'd love to just ask you an important question, which is we are seeing a rise of interest in socialism that's unprecedented in the history of the United States, largely fueled by what some would argue is a a challenging income growth situation, student loan debt. I mean, it's a very different situation than Venezuela, but many middle class American children are finding themselves unable to progress like every generation before them. in US history. They cannot seem to create a better lives for themselves than their parents.</p>
</details>

主持人：结果是，我们看到在纽约这样的城市，佐兰·姆达尼（Zoran Mdani）成为市长热门人选，还有一些总统候选人被讨论，他们可能也有社会主义议程和社会主义兴趣。我想给您一个机会，向美国青年讲述委内瑞拉经历社会主义循环所吸取的教训，也许您可以分享一些能够帮助他们对美国民主未来的选择有不同思考的东西。

<p class="english-text">And as a result, we are seeing in cities like New York, Zoran Mdani being the favorite to become mayor and presidential candidates being discussed that maybe also have a socialist agenda and socialist interest. I want to give you an opportunity to speak to the youth of America about the lessons learned with what Venezuela has gone through with its socialist cycle here and maybe something that you could share that could help them think a little bit more differently about the choices ahead for the American democracy.</p>
</details>

马查多：是的。嗯，我们26年前也经历过同样的经历。人们会警告我们说，你知道，小心社会主义和共产主义会给你带来什么。我们总是回答说，委内瑞拉不是古巴。那不会发生在我们身上。但最终，看看，你知道，那场灾难性的破坏。我们有900万人散布在世界各地。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yes. Um, we went through the same experience, you know, 26 years ago. People would warn us and say, you know, watch out what socialism and communism could bring to you.

We had, you know, 9 million of our people spread around the world.</p>
</details>

马查多：事实是，只有拥有自由和民主，你才能和平繁荣地生活。这就是我们的教训。那些承诺免费给你提供你需要通过努力工作才能得到的东西的人，最终会向你收取你所能拥有的最宝贵的资产，那就是你的自由，你做选择和做决定的能力。这是一个重要的教训，我的意思是，当国家凌驾于你之上时，这意味着整个社会可能会在贫困和苦难中平等。所以我确实信任。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and and the fact is that you can only live in peace and prosperity if you have freedom and and democracy. That's our lesson. And and those who offer to give you for free what you need to get on your own with hard work at the end end up you know charging you with the the most valuable asset you could have which is your freedom your capacity to decide and to make your own decisions and um that's that's a great lesson I mean when you have the state on top of you h that means whole society will probably be we equal in misery and poverty. So I do trust</p>

马查多：美国的制度、美国精神和美国梦。我认为这些诱惑多次出现，它们是好的，因为它们让社会反思自己所拥有的，并明白以前的自由和民主应该被捍卫，在你生命的每一天都应该被呵护。当你失去它时，很难再找回来。这是一个我们将传授给我们的孩子和孙辈的教训。我相信美国人民珍视他们所拥有的。我希望，你知道，有这么多知情的人在您身边，也能让您了解这些系统的威胁和危险。
