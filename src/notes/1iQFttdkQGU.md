### F1：一项运动还是一场电视秀？

**Nicolai:** 大家好。我是**挪威主权财富基金**（Norwegian Southern Wealth Fund: 挪威政府养老基金全球）的首席执行官**尼古拉·坦根**（Nicolai Tangen），今天我非常荣幸能与赛车运动传奇人物**斯蒂法诺·多梅尼卡利**（Stefano Domenicali）共处一室，他目前担任**一级方程式赛车**（Formula 1: 简称F1）的总裁兼首席执行官。斯蒂法诺，非常感谢您的加入。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody. I'm Nicolola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Southern Wealth Fund and today I'm in really really good company in the fast lane actually with the motorsport legends Stefano Dominicali. Stefano is the president and CEO of Formula 1. Great and thanks for joining us.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 谢谢您，尼古拉。也感谢我们所有的粉丝和支持者，尤其是那些可能还不认识我的新朋友。这太棒了，我们可以与他们建立联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. Thank you Nikolai. And thanks to all our fans and supporters and above all maybe new people that they don't have a clue who I am. That's great. So we can connect with them.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 好的，斯蒂法诺，首先，F1究竟是一项运动还是一场电视秀？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Now, uh, Stefano, first of all, is Formula 1 a sport or a TV show?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，它绝对是一项运动。但当然，当您提到电视秀时，我需要了解您认为电视秀是负面评价还是正面评论。我想说，与过去相比，F1如今的显著不同之处在于它在全球范围内备受关注。因此，我们确实需要了解，要在娱乐世界中保持相关性，需要哪些要素。因为我认为体育是更大图景的一部分，一个娱乐平台应该是什么样子，而我们无疑就是一个娱乐平台，其核心当然是赛道上车手之间的体育竞技，他们对我们来说是这项运动的瑰宝，以及代表我们技术层面的赛车。但如今的F1不仅仅是这些，它关乎人们聚集在一起，享受乐趣，并为合作伙伴提供商业发展等其他机会，或者让每个人都有机会与我们所能提供的一切建立联系，确保在一个可以选择很多事物的环境中，您会被我们的“菜单”所吸引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's definitely a sport, but of course, when you're talking about TV show, I need to understand what you think as a TV show is a negative approach or or as a positive comment. I would say what is definitely different from the past is F1 is listen what is all around the world. So we definitely need to understand what are the ingredients to to be relevant in the world of uh I said entertainment because um sport is a part of what I believe a bigger picture uh what an entertainment platform should be and we are definitely that is an entertainment platform where we have at the center of course the sporting challenge the sporting fight on the track with the drivers who are for us the jewel of our sport and the cars uh which represent the technological aspect of us. But today F1 is not only about it is about having people gathering together, having people that have the chance to have fun, enjoy and given the chance to other opportunity like business development for partners or having the chance for everyone to connect with what we can offer to make sure that in a sort of uh situation where I can choose a lot of things, you can be attracted of our menu.</p>
</details>

### 粉丝群体的演变与市场拓展

**Nicolai:** 您的“菜单”现在真是令人难以置信。那么，粉丝群体是如何变化的？现在的粉丝群体是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M and you have and your menu is is incredible just now. So who's who's how has the fan base changed? What's the fan base now?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，粉丝群体在过去几年中确实发生了变化。以前，我们有很多狂热的男性粉丝，占比高达90%，而且年龄普遍偏大。当然，我们是全球性的，所以这只是一个平均值。现在，我们的粉丝越来越年轻，人口构成也更加多样化。例如，在新市场中，我们有40%的女性粉丝和60%的男性粉丝，平均年龄为35岁。所以，我们正在进入这个领域，正如我们所说，不同的文化、不同的敏感度、不同的运动方式，但有一个共同点，那就是我们需要确保每个人都能参与其中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the fan base has changed definitely in the last couple of years. The change the fans base has changed because before we were very avid fans uh male 90% quite uh old in term of age. Of course we have worldwide so as to be a sort of average of what we are talking about. Now we are getting younger and younger which are much uh diverse population. New market for example we are 40 we 40% women 60% men 35 years of age. So we are getting in that landscape and as we said different culture different sensitivities different approach to the sport but uh with one common ground you know and that's where we need to make sure that everyone is sitting in.</p>
</details>

### 平衡历史赛道与新赛场

**Nicolai:** 当您审视您的赛场时，现在一个赛季有24场比赛。您如何平衡历史悠久的赛场与新的赛场？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you when you look at your uh your venues, you are now at 24 races a season. Um how do you balance the kind of the historic venues with the new with the newer ones?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，首先，对我来说，有一点必须明确：历史是一种价值，如果它意味着与我们的运动相关的伟大基础。如果历史意味着“老旧”，那它就不再是历史，而是停留在过去。因此，我认为对我们来说，重要的是确保那些曾是我们历史一部分的赛道和国家，如果它们愿意继续投资未来，将对留在我们的赛历中至关重要。这将会发生，24场比赛是目前的上限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all uh for me is is to be clear one thing historical is a value if uh means that there are great foundation related to our sport. If historical mean old is not anymore historical is is looking in the past. And therefore what I think is relative important for us is to make sure that the races and the countries that has been part of our history with the will to keep investing in the future will be vital to stay in our calendar and this will happen and 24 is max 24 is is a max number today.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您认为这个数字有点高，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">think it's a bit high even or no</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 不，我不这么认为，我来告诉您为什么。我的意思是，关于这一点有很多两极分化的立场。首先，我回到我们必须保持相关性的需求。我告诉我的团队，我们不是来与其他的体育平台竞争的，我们是来与电影、音乐、活动以及粉丝日程上的其他事物竞争的。您知道，我们的生活节奏非常快，这与F1的方式非常相似，需要快速行动，需要看到新事物，否则就会变得老旧而不相关。因此，我回到一个事实，那就是我们的内容并不多。如果您想想，我们有24场比赛，20名车手，您能想象，如果要在创造正确新闻的世界中保持竞争力，而其他运动有100场比赛，有数百名运动员，您知道，我们需要在这方面找到正确的相关性。因此，这比以往任何时候都更加复杂。所以，我不认为24场比赛是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think so and and and and I tell you why I mean uh there are a lot of uh polarized position on that uh first of all I go back to what we need to be in term of relevancy I said to my people we are not here to compete against other sport platform we are here to compete with movies with with music with events with other things that are in the agenda of our fans. You know, our life is is is really is a sort of and this is very close to F1 approach in a sort of quick speed action needs of seeing new things otherwise you get old and not relevant. Therefore, I go back to the fact that uh we have not a lot of content. If you think we have 24 races, 20 drivers, can you imagine if you have to be competitive in the world of creating the right news with sport when they have 100 games when sport with they have hundreds of athletes, you know, we need to find the right relevancy on that. Therefore, is more complicated than ever. Therefore, I don't think the 24 are are</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您认为会放弃一些赛道以引入新的国家吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think you drop some to introduce some new countries?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，是的，当然。或者我们也在考虑轮换一些地方，以提供机会让它们来来去去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, uh yes, for sure. Or we are thinking also to rotate some places in a sort of possibility to to give chances to to come and and go in a sort</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 有哪些您希望引入的新地方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what are some of the new places you would love to do?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我们首先要明确一点，这很重要。我们今天非常健康，因为我们与许多合作伙伴签订了长期协议。因此，能够进入赛历的空位非常少。所以，我们首先需要保持强度，推动现有的合作伙伴不断提高我们希望提供给粉丝的服务质量。在新市场方面，我想说我们在美国取得了巨大的飞跃。三年前我们只有一场比赛，现在有三场。我认为未来一个重要的关注区域是远东，当然，我们希望监测的一个区域是非洲，因为它是唯一没有参与锦标赛的大陆。但在进入那里之前，我们需要确保在长期结构方面具备适当的条件。所以，这些地方，您知道，如果您回想一下，我们一直都是世界锦标赛，但我们曾经是欧洲中心主义的，大部分比赛都在欧洲举行。现在，我们基本上有一个非常清晰的方式来划分我们的赛历，划分为不同的区域，现在我们在这方面非常平衡。但正如我所说，重点是检查是否有新的机会出现。我们当然有选择。所以，我们处于一种高质量的境地，我们可以选择并确保做出正确的决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we are thinking first of all let me do one thing that is important to state it. We have we are very healthy today because we have a long-term agreement with a lot of partners. Yeah. Therefore, the slot to be able to jump into the calendar are very minimal. Uh therefore I we need to first of all keep the intensity of you know pushing the actual one to keep increasing the quality of the offer that we want to give to our fans. In term of new markets I would say that we have done a big jump in US. We were one races just three years ago. Now we are three. I think that one relevant area to control or to see if what we can do in the future is the far east and and and and of course one area that we want to monitor uh is Africa because it's the only continent that is not there in the championship but before getting there we need to make sure that you know there are the right condition in a term in a long-term uh structure. So these are the places you know if you think back you know we were we have been always a world championship but we were Europe Europeentric we were having the majority races in Europe. Now we have basically a very very clear way of dividing our calendar in in in in zone in in in in area where now we are really balanced on that. But as I said the focus is to stay to to check if there are new opportunity that are coming in. We have options for sure. So we are in a sort of qualitative situation where we can choose and and make sure that the decision is right.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 在这项运动中，娱乐因素和安全考量之间是否存在权衡？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a trade-off between entertainment factor and safety concerns in this sport?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，安全始终是核心。我们绝不想危及或最小化对安全的重视。安全仍然是这项运动的基本支柱，无论如何，正如我们的通行证上所写，赛车运动无疑是危险的。但我要说的是，过去发生的转折点是94年的事故，当时**塞纳**（Ayrton Senna）和其他车手**拉岑贝格尔**（Roland Ratzenberger）在一场非常悲惨的事件中丧生。从那一刻起，**国际汽车联合会**（FIA: Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile，赛车运动的管理机构）在安全方面迈出了巨大的一步，我们必须承认这一点，因为当然，后来我们也有其他的悲剧，但非常少，我们的职责是对此不找任何借口，因为安全将始终是核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, safety has been always the center. We don't want to jeopardize or to minimize at all uh the approach on safety. safety remain as a sort of fundamental pillars of of a sport that in any case as is written in our passes motorsport is definitely dangerous. But what I have to say that uh uh the turning moment of what has happened uh in the past has been the the accident in 94 when Senna and other drivers Ratenburgger died in a very tragic event. From that moment, the FIA did an imive step versus safety and we need to be to recognize that because of course we had other tragedies later on but very minimal and our duty is not to give any kind of sort of excuses to that because that will stay always at the center.</p>
</details>

### 安全与规则变革

**Stefano:** 顺便说一句，安全并不意味着您不能在赛道上进行一场充满动作和戏剧性的精彩锦标赛，那是另一回事，但安全是不可协商的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">M and and by the way safety doesn't mean that you cannot have a proper championship in term of action in term of drama on the track that is different story but that will not be not negotiable.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 现在，您有一些监管上的变化，部分是为了增加戏剧性，对吗？或者增加它的竞争精神。那么，您认为这些监管变化将如何改变这项运动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you have uh some regulatory changes partly to increase drama right or the competitive uh spirit of it. Now how do you uh how do you think these regulation changes will will uh change the sport?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我认为首先，法规变化总是有原因的，主要有两个因素。一是保持技术相关性，这是我们作为一项运动需要始终放在项目核心的。其次，当然，过去所做的另一件事是为了确保在保持这项运动的吸引力方面进行某种重组。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think that first of all there is always the reason why there is a change on the regulation and there is mainly the two there are two factors. One is to stay relevant in term of technological uh opportunity that we as a sport need to keep at the center of our project. Secondly, of course, the other thing that has been done in the past is to make sure there was a sort of reshuffleling in term of keeping the sport at the interest.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 这不是团队和技术重组的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is not the case for this reaff of the teams and technology.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 正确。如果您有一辆超级赛车，您改变了规定，那么那辆车在下个赛季就会变得不那么好。嗯，可能是这样，其他的车队可能有机会追赶。但这并不是今年或明年（抱歉）的情况。因为如果您今天看，赛车之间的差距非常小，从未如此接近，所以几年前决定改变的原因是我们希望将**可持续燃料**（sustainable fuel: 一种环保型燃料，旨在减少碳排放）和**混合动力**（hybridization: 将内燃机与电动机结合的动力系统）的相关性保持在技术方案的核心。这就是我们进行改变的原因。因此，我预计今年肯定会有一些事情会影响到某些车队和/或制造商在法规方面比其他车队发展得更好。如果与其他车队相比，这意味着我们可能会有更大的差距，但法规的制定方式是，如果出现这种情况，其他车队追赶的时间会更少。所以，这一点非常重要，必须明确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. If you got like a super car, you change regulations so then that car is less good next season. Well, could be that the other could have a chance to recatch up. But that's not the case of this year of next year, sorry. Because if you think and if you look today, the gaps between the cars is so minimal, never been so so close that the reason why there's been a change decided couple of years ago is because we want to keep the relevancy of the sustainable fuel and the hybridization at the center of the technological package. So that's was the reason why we have the change. Therefore, what I'm expecting this year, there will be for sure some something that will have an effect on the fact that some teams and or manufacturer has been able to develop better than regulation. If you compare with the others, that means that we can have bigger gaps, but the regulation is tied up in a way that if this will be the case, there will be less time for the others to catch up. So that's very important to keep it clear.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 那么，随着明年新法规的实施，您认为对这项运动会产生什么结果？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with the regulations coming in for next year for instance what do you think will be the result in terms of the sport?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 这项运动的结果将是，我们将看到谁能更好地理解新法规并进行开发。我认为，一如既往，因为历史表明，总会有一些车队比其他车队更强大，而唯一不同的是，我们已经建立了一个系统，如果出现这种情况，其他车队能够尽快追赶，以确保我们能像今天一样，拥有一个差距非常非常小的锦标赛，并且不同车队和不同车手之间展开激烈的竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The result of the sport will be we will see west develop better the their understanding of the new regulation. I think that as always because that's history that shows that there will be things that will be big stronger than others and and and and the only thing that is different is that we have put in place a system that will enable you know if this will be the case for the others to catch up as quickly as possible to make sure that we can have as today a championship with the gaps that are very very marginal and and and a fight between different teams and different drivers.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 所以，更接近的比赛，更容易超车？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So closer racing easier to overtake.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 是的，这始终是我们希望以不同方式实现的目标原则。当然，这对我们来说非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, that's that's always the the principle of what we want to do to achieve in a different way. But that's of course uh very important for us.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 那么空气动力学变化呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about the aerodynamic changes?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 空气动力学变化与**动力单元**（power unit: 赛车引擎及相关混合动力系统）的不同使用方式有关，因为动力单元将是50%的电力部署和50%的传统内燃机动力部署。因此，为了适应这种复杂性，赛车在**空气动力学**（aerodynamics: 研究物体在气体中运动时的力学特性）方面将有所不同，在可激活的不同表面管理方面也将有所不同。这将是不可思议的，因为我们将一如既往地给予车队工程师（他们是世界上最优秀的）开发的机会，看看他们能提出什么样的解决方案，让车队比其他车队更快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dynamic changes are connected to the different way of using the power unit because a power unit will be 50% deployment electric power and 50% deploy of uh traditional and terminal power. Therefore, in order to adjust the complexity of this, the cars will be different in term of aerodynamics, in term of management of the different surfaces that you can activate. And this is something that will be incredible because we will we will have given, you know, as always the chance to the engineers of a team that are the best in the world to develop and to see what they can come as a sort of solution to be uh to allow that team to be faster than the others.</p>
</details>

### 可持续发展目标

**Nicolai:** 从历史上看，我们看到许多这里的进步最终进入了大众市场。您现在看到了哪些可能进入大众市场的事物？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Historically, we've seen a lot of the advances here moving into the mess market eventually. What are some of the things you are seeing now which could could move into the nice market?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，对于未来来说，**可持续燃料**无疑是相关的。您知道，这里不是讨论对错的地方。很明显，在出行方面，已经转向了全面电动化，但这不能被视为出行世界的唯一答案，因为它太复杂了。今天非常昂贵的可持续燃料，应该而且将通过F1的发展，成为制造商向全球不同客户提供的产品组合中的另一个解决方案，这非常非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, definitely what is relevant for for the future is the sustainable fuel. You know, and this is not really the place to talk about right or wrong. It's clear that on the mobility side has been a shift versus full electrification that cannot be seen as the only answer to the world of mobility because it's too complicated, too complex. Sustainable fuel that today is very very expensive uh should and would will to thanks to formal one development be able to be another solution on the portfolio of the offer that the manufacturer will give to the different customer around the world and that's very very relevant.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 但燃料只占碳足迹的一小部分，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the fuel is a small part of the carbon footprint right</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 绝对是。您在F1也有一些目标，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely and and you have some goals here for formula 1</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 是的，我的意思是，我们在赛道上燃烧的燃料非常少。如果您看，我们的碳排放足迹主要有两个来源。一个是我们的物流，因为我们是世界锦标赛，我们不能停止旅行。因此，例如，今年我们已经与合作伙伴合作，使用**可持续航空燃料**（sustainable aviation fuel: 简称SAF，由非化石原料制成的航空燃料），它非常昂贵，但已经是朝着最小化碳排放的正确方向迈出的一步。我们所有的其他物流都已经在使用运输系统，以最小化碳足迹，然后当然，另一个我们正在努力变得更强大的重要一步是我们如何与推广商合作。您知道，我们举办的活动有40万人聚集在一起，您可以想象在能源供应、所用材料质量方面的复杂性。所以，这是一个巨大的项目，涉及到F1的整个生态系统，试图理解这并非儿戏。这是我们未来非常重要的一个元素，因此，这就是为什么我们希望在2030年前实现**碳中和**（carbon neutral: 通过抵消排放，使净碳排放量为零）的目标。这是一项艰巨的任务。世界上没有其他运动做出过这样的承诺，并有独立审计机构监测我们所做的一切。所以，我们必须说，我们为我们所做的一切感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes I mean the fuel that we burn on the track is very marginal We if you if you look we have two main sources of our uh footprint of of carbon emission. One is our logistics because we are a world championship and we cannot and know we cannot stop traveling. Therefore for example already this year we are working together with our partners to use sustainable aviation fuel that is very expensive but is already a step in the right direction to minimize it. our you know all our the other logistics are already using system of transport that are minimizing the carbon footprint and then of course the other big step that is we are working to be even stronger uh is how we work with the promoters you know well we are hosting events with 400,000 people gathering together you can imagine the complexity of having the right energy the right quality of material to be used uh so it's a huge project that is involved with all the ecosystem of for to try uh to understand that this is not a joke. This is a very important element of our of our future and therefore that's why we want to keep the target of being carbon neutral within 2030. It's a big task. No other sport no other sport in in in the world has taken as a commitment with facts with the independent auditing that is monitoring what we're doing. So we have to say we are very proud of what we're doing.</p>
</details>

### 车手特质与团队动力

**Nicolai:** 谈谈车手。现在您有20名车手。与历史上相比，目前的20名车手有多优秀？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to the drivers. Uh now you got uh 20 drivers. How good are the current 20 drivers compared to history?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 很难比较，因为车手必须放在特定的时代背景中。但可以肯定的是，今天的车手非常有竞争力，非常专业。今年我们首次有五名年轻新车手进入F1。这表明，他们表现得非常好，我们对此非常高兴，因为这意味着F2和F3等后备梯队非常强大，这意味着我们拥有未来。现在，您可能已经注意到，我们还在我们的体系中加入了**F1学院**（F1 Academy: 一项旨在培养女性车手的赛事），以确保在我们希望推行的多元化和包容性项目中，未来女性也能成为F1理念的一部分，这是一个巨大的项目。因此，我认为车手们非常强大，非常优秀，拥有不同的个性。我们不希望每个人都一样。我们希望确保每个人都与众不同，并且能够通过我们沟通的方式，通过我们的社交媒体、他们的社交媒体以及我们提供的新沟通平台，成为一种榜样，激励其他人或我们这项运动的其他爱好者被我们所做的一切吸引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Difficult to compare because drivers has to be put in the contest over the period. But for sure the drivers today are very very competitive, very very professional. This year for the first time we have five new young drivers that are coming into form one. That shows that and doing well right are doing very very well and that why we are very happy because that means that the pyramid behind that is formal 2 form 3 are very strong that means that we can have the future and now as you have may have noticed we have added into our pyramid the F1 academy to make sure that in our diverse project that we want to an inclusive project that we want to take on also women to be in the future be able to be part of of the F1 idea that is massive. So therefore I think that the drivers are very very strong, very very good uh different personality. We don't want to have everyone the same. We want to make sure that everyone is different from uh from each other and able through the way that we are able to communicate our social media, our their social media, the new platform of communication that we are offering to be a sort of role model that can inspire other people or other you know lovers of our sport to be attracted to to to to what we're doing.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 什么造就了一名优秀的车手？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What makes a good driver?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 毫无疑问，造就一名优秀车手，您必须速度快。如果您不赢，您可以说很多好话，但您需要赢。因此，成绩非常重要。当然，您需要明白有一个更大的图景。今天不仅仅是驾驶，还要明白F1现在如此之大，您需要理解您的公共角色。您对粉丝、客户、合作伙伴负有责任，您有一个公众形象。当您驾驶F1赛车时，您必须接受这一点。否则，如果您只是想驾驶，恕我直言，如果您只想跑里程，您可以成为一名出色的**优步**（Uber: 共享出行平台）司机。但那不是我们在F1所需要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Makes a good driver for sure. No no need to say that you have to be quick. If you are not winning, you can talk a lot of good things but you need to win. Therefore, results are very important. Of course, you need to understand that there is a bigger picture. Today is not only driving is only is also understanding that F1 today is so big that you need to understand your public role. Your committed with the with the with the fans, with the customers, with the partners, you have a public face. You have to accept when you are driving in a Formula One. Otherwise, if you just want to drive without being disrespectful, if you want to do only mileage, you can be a great Uber driver. But that's what what we don't need in Forum One.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您认为是否有其他更快的车手，因为他们没有公众形象而无法进入F1？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Do you think there are faster drivers out there who don't have because they don't have a personal face? Uh, no.</p>

**Stefano:** 不，我认为F1代表了真实的画面，总是最快的。当然，如果没有一辆合适的赛车，您就不能成为冠军，因为您可能是最优秀的，但如果没有一辆快车，您就无法展现真正的实力，但这就是生活。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think that F1 is is representative of the real uh picture, always the fastest. Of course, you you can be you cannot be a champion without a proper car because you can be the best and you don't have the possibility to have it to have a fast car. You're not showing the real quality, but that's life.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 成为一名真正快的车手需要什么？需要哪些技能？哪些心理能力，哪些运动能力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the What does it take to be a really fast driver? What what are the what are the the skill? What's the the mental capabilities, the motoric?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我认为，假设今天当您身处F1车手的竞技场时，您理所当然地是一名非常优秀的专业人士，身体素质非常好。您理解成为F1车手的需求。在我看来，真正冠军的区别在于能够将您所做的动作和赛车的动作“**碎片化**”（defragmented: 在此指将复杂动作分解为微小部分进行优化），以最大化每一帧的性能。所以，在您这边如何最大化，我们谈论的是毫秒级的差距。您可以想象，这微不足道。所以，如果您想成为最优秀的，您需要放慢一切，尝试看看在哪里可以改进，以及您希望您的赛车在哪里更快。这就是最优秀车手的特质。理解即使您以每小时300公里甚至更高的速度行驶，您也能掌控一切，以最大化您的表现、您的团队表现和您的赛车表现。

<p class="english-text">Well, I think that le let's assume that today when you are in that arena of being a form one driver, you given for granted the fact that you are a very good professional, you are very very well fit. You you understand the needs of being an F1 driver. What makes the difference of a really in my opinion of a pure championship is to be able to defragmented the action that you are doing and the car that and the action of the car to maximize every single frame of the performance. So on your side how to maximize we're talking about the gaps of millisecond. Can you imagine it's nothing. So if you want to be the best, you need to slow down everything to try to see where you can improve and where you want for your car to be faster. That's the characteristic of the best driver. Understanding that even if no matter if you are running at 300 or maybe more kilometers per hour, you're able to to have everything under control to maximize your performance, the performance of your team, the performance of your car.</p>

**Nicolai:** 赛车有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is the car?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 至关重要。毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Crucial. There's no doubt about it.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 那么，如果把最好的车手放在20辆赛车中最差的那辆里，结果会怎样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh you know but how much is actually if you put the best driver in the worst car of the of the 20 what would the results be?</p>

**Stefano:** 他肯定不会是锦标赛的领跑者。我的意思是，如果赛车差距太大，他无法实现那种飞跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There would not be the the leader of the championship for sure. I mean he cannot make if the gap of the car is too big he will not make that jump.</p>

**Nicolai:** 差距有多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how big is the gap?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，今天有些赛车肯定落后，而当差距变得微不足道时，当您遇到困难条件时，您会看到最好的车手，那时您才能真正理解他能够做出什么样的决定，而不是其他人都在做其他事情。所以，一如既往，在极端条件下您会看到优秀的车手，但很明显，您可以与世界上所有的车手交谈，如果您的基础没有一辆好车，您就不能成为冠军。这是肯定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, today there are some cars that you know are behind for sure and the best driver you see when the the gaps will become marginal when when you have difficult conditions when you understand really what is able to make as a sort of call on his side rather than the others are doing other stuff. So, as always, the good the good drivers you see in the in the extreme condition, but it's it's pretty clear that you can talk with all the drivers in the world that if you don't have a good car as a base, you cannot be a champion. That's for sure.</p>

<p class="english-text">What is it? What's the What is it most similar to?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我认为它是所有这些的结合。从某种意义上说，如果您是一名F1车手，您需要对一些完全疯狂的事情感到恐惧，但从某种意义上说，您也有点疯狂，因为您永远不会以他们那样的方式驾驶。但是，您知道，今天的车手就像今天的飞行员一样。他们是那些知道如何最大化自己表现以及他们所驾驶车辆表现的人。所以，他们是伟大的人。我的意思是，世界上只有20个这样的人，每个人都相信“啊，我能做到”，但当您身临其境时，您就会明白为什么不是每个人都适合F1。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think that is is a combination of everything. In a way, if you are a formula one driver, uh you need to be scared about something that is totally crazy, but in a way, you are a little bit crazy because you would never run in in the in the way that they're running. But, uh you know, the drivers of today are like the pilots of today. Uh they are the ones that know how to maximize their performance and the performance of the of the vehicle that they have under the their their body. So uh they are great men. I mean there are only 20 in the world and uh everyone believes ah I can do that but when you're there you you know you will understand the reason why is not everyone ready for for one.</p>

<p class="english-text">Uh how important is physical fitness?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 它很重要，毫无疑问，但不像过去那样。通过赛车的发展，我们已经能够消除许多身体限制。因此，如果您是一名优秀的运动员，当然，有些肌肉更重要，比如颈部，以及您在脚上施加的压力。但例如，今天在转向方面，有**动力转向**（power steering: 辅助驾驶员转向的系统）。它不再像过去那样需要巨大的肌肉，或者过去变速箱需要人们手上起水泡。所以，这不同了。但我想说，他们今天都是伟大的运动员，但他们在训练时也表现出色，他们每天都像真正的运动员一样训练。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It is important no doubt but it's not like in the past we have been able through the development of the cars to put a lot of put out a lot of limitation in term of physical constraint. Therefore, if you have a good athlete, of course, there are muscles that are more important uh that are neck that are the pressure that you can apply on the feet. But for example, today on the on the steering, there is the power steering. It's not anymore like in the old days where you really have the big muscle or when you have the gearbox in the old days that you have people with the with the blaster with what you call the the the blister on your hands. So, that's different. But uh I would say they are all today great athletes but great performance also when they train they train every day like uh really uh because they are a really sportman.</p>

**Stefano:** 我想您会看到与过去的不同。您知道，过去他们对驾驶有一种浪漫的看法。但今天，他们早上会进行体能训练，然后他们会在模拟器上工作，然后他们会与工程师合作，然后他们会观看不同的视频来提高自己，观察其他人在做什么，他们会准备新的赛道，所以他们今天非常专业，没有太多老派车手的空间，那些像花花公子之类的。这可能仍然存在，但非常少。

<p class="english-text">Is it fair that one company can have multiple teams?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，公平地说，实际上在F1中，有一家公司拥有两个车队，但这是有原因的，我们总是需要记住这个原因，我们应该感谢**红牛**（Red Bull: 知名饮料品牌，在F1拥有两支车队）投入了大量资金来发展这项运动，我们必须承认这一点。

<p class="english-text">Now what's your position to allowing new teams such as Cadillac to join?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我的立场非常明确。我们同意允许再增加一个车队加入锦标赛，因为我们最终拥有了所有要素，我们认为这对于信誉、对于这项运动的附加价值来说非常重要，而凯迪拉克最终满足了这些标准。所以，我们非常高兴他们将从明年开始成为锦标赛的一部分。这不会容易，但我认为他们需要考虑这是一个学习曲线，但我认为这将有利于这项运动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well my position is very clear. We were in agreement to allow one more team to to to to to be part of the of the of the championship because we had all the elements at the end that we fulfilled what we believe is relatively that is really important to have in term of credibility in term of what could be and will be the added value to the sport and and and and Cadillac at the end of the process basically fulfilled this this criteria. So we are very happy that now they will be part starting from next year to be part of the championship. It will not be easy but I think that is a learning curve that they need to consider but I think there will be benefit the sport.</p>

<p class="english-text">Now you have a regulatory body the uh FIA um which very few sports have. What's the relationship between the FIA and the F1?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，首先，我们的运动与其他运动的区别在于，我们有两个不同的、互补的角色需要共同扮演。他们是监管者，我们是商业权利持有者，我们共同需要发展这项运动的形态。这写在我们的协议中，是多年前制定的，这是我们必须记住的基本事情。其他运动只有一个联合会，他们管理一切。我们不是那样的。所以我们需要确保我们每个人都为这项运动的利益做正确的事情，这无疑是我们共同的目标，尽管我们有不同的人，并希望我们的决定是为了这项运动的最佳利益而做出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, the difference between our sport and other sport is that we have two different uh complimentary role to play together. They are the regulator, we are the commercial right holder in together we need to develop the shape of our sport. It is written in our agreement has been done many many years ago and this is a fundamental things that we need to remember. Other sport have one federation and they running everything. We are not like that. So we need to make sure that each of us is doing the right thing for the benefit of the sport and that's for sure the goal that we have sharing you know despite we have different people uh and hoping that our decision are done for the best of our sport.</p>

### F1的商业增长与媒体策略

**Nicolai:** 现在您已经达到了最大比赛数量，并且在开发许多收入来源方面取得了巨大成功。您打算如何从这里继续发展这项运动的收入？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you're already at the max number of uh of races you've been hugely successful in developing a lot of revenue streams just where how can how how do you intend to grow the this the revenues from here the sport from here?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我记得几年前我们第一次召开财报电话会议时，因为我们是一家上市公司，您知道。每个人都会说“你们怎么能做到？”我说：“听着，只要努力工作，并不断理解总有增长的空间。如果您做得很好，那就是我们前进的方式。”我的意思是，就是要放眼大局，明白今天不仅仅是一项运动，还要明白我们当然有媒体版权、赞助、推广费等主流收入，但我们也有可能通过访问我们粉丝的数据来更深入地挖掘它们的价值，这将使我们在增长和业务方面迈出新的一步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I remember when we had the first earning calls a couple of years ago. Uh because we are a public company as you know. Uh and everyone will say how you can do it. They say listen just work hard and keep understanding that there is always place to grow. If you're doing a good job uh that's the way we are going. I mean it just to think big to understand is not only a sport today and understanding that we have of course mainstream that are media rights, sponsorship, promoter fees but then we have the possibility to go deeper in in exploiting the value of them also through the the access to the data of our fans and that will enable us to do another step in term of growth and the business.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您如何利用这些数据？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you how can you use the data?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 我们可以利用它来创建个性化内容，提供给我们的客户。我们可以为他们所有人准备特别的套餐。全世界有数百万这样的客户。因此，对我们来说，就是要做好准备去做。系统越坚固，创造的价值就越多，这些价值就会越多地回馈到我们正在投资的资产价值中。所以，如果您看看几年前，我们有四个全球合作伙伴。现在我们有了更多。我们需要合理化全球、区域、技术、官方之间的区别。这是一个质量问题，因为当然，这个平台正在提高水平和标准，因为一切都在朝着这个方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can use it to to create personalized content that we can offer to our customer. We can prepare special package to all of them. They are millions around the world. Therefore, it's just for us to be ready to do it. And the more the system is solid, the more this create value and the more this value will be bring back to the value of of the asset that we are investing in. So if you just look for example couple of years ago, we had four global partners. Now we have uh much more. We have to rationalize the differentiation between global, regional, technical, official. And that's a quality problem because of course this this platform is raising up the level and the bar because everything is pushing in this direction.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 那么，**Netflix**（Netflix: 流媒体服务平台）上的《**极速求生**》（Drive to Survive: 一部关于F1的纪录片系列）对F1的发展有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So um the drive to survive on Netflix, how important do you think that's been to developing?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very important. Very important.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 它是如何产生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did it come about?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 它之所以产生，是因为您知道，以前担任这个职位的人，**蔡斯·凯里**（Chase Carey: F1前首席执行官），他理解以不同方式与人们沟通的方法，他们来自美国的方式，我想说《极速求生》是完美的例子，它也在正确的时间出现，在疫情期间人们有更多时间来消化和观看这类内容，这使我们能够向那些以前不了解我们的人开放新市场，因此这对我们进入新的粉丝维度非常有益。它之所以好，是因为它让那些不了解我们的人大开眼界，因为顺便说一句，我们的车手戴着手套、穿着赛车服、戴着头盔，开着赛车，您看不到他们。所以我们能够打开一扇窗，以不同的方式向新粉丝解释我们的运动。所以这非常重要。当然，不仅如此，我们还通过社交媒体以更开放的方式与粉丝建立联系。我总是说，我们在独家提案中非常包容。但当然，我们不会停止我们想做的事情。我的意思是，我们今年将推出F1电影。这是在不同领域与粉丝互动的一种新方式，由**布拉德·皮特**（Brad Pitt: 知名美国演员）主演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It came back it came about from the fact that you know the people that were previously close in this position uh with the Chase Kerry you know understanding the the the the the approach of having you know a different way to communicate with the people they're coming from American approach and I would say try to survive were the perfect example to that came also at the right time with co for people to have more time to to digest and see these kind of of things that enable us to open uh h new markets to people that didn't have a clue who we were and therefore that was very beneficial for us to get into new dimension of fans and it was good because it was opening the eyes to people that do not see us because by the way our drivers have gloves overall helmets cars you don't see them. Uh so we were able to open the window to a different way of explaining our sport to new fans. So that's was that was very important. Not only that, of course, then we had a new way of connecting with with with our fans through social media, much more open. I always used to say that we are very inclusive in our exclusive exclusive proposition. But then of course we are not stopping what we want to do. I mean uh we're going to launch the movie F1 this year. That's another way to be on a different landscape for for fans with Brad Pitt.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 是的，正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Correct.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 我们将在六月中旬推出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to launch it in in in in the middle of June.</p>

**Nicolai:** 您在其中有角色吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you have a role in it?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 不，不，不。我没有角色。车手是瑰宝，当然，故事非常精彩，我们选择合作的原因是因为这是一个真实的项目，由认真、专业和不可思议的人士参与。**苹果制作公司**（Apple production: 指Apple Studios），**杰瑞·布鲁克海默**（Jerry Bruckheimer: 知名好莱坞制片人），**好莱坞**（Hollywood: 美国电影产业中心），以及**约瑟夫·科辛斯基**（Joseph Kosinski: 知名导演）担任导演，您知道，这是一个非常非常大的项目，我们能够在比赛周末期间完成，而不会影响现场比赛。所以这是另一种方式来表明我们致力于横向思考，另一种与其他人沟通的方式是，例如，我们创建了儿童电视节目，使用相同的图像，但配有儿童评论员、儿童图形和儿童音乐，只是为了与不同的观众保持相关性，这就是我们想做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, no. No, no, no. I'm not a role. The the jewel as the drivers and and and of course the the story is is is is very nice and the reason why we choose to be together is because it's an authentic project uh with a serious uh professional and incredible people. Apple production, Jerry Brookimer, Hollywood uh and and Joe Kosinski as a director and as you know it's it's a big big big things that will be able we were able to do it during the course of racing weekend without touching the live sport. So it's another way to show that we are committed to think laterally and another way to to say to commu to to communicate with other people is for example you know we created kids TV so using the same kind of uh images but with the commentators that are kids with the graphics that are for kids music for kids just to be relevant for different audiences that's what we want to do.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 《极速求生》是否放大了竞争？

<p class="english-text">But do you think it exaggerates uh rivalries?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 说实话，我不这么认为。了解真相。它可能以不同的语言解释，但幕后的竞争确实存在。我的意思是，这是一项运动。每个人都在尽力竞争，某些动态是我们世界的一部分。所以，我认为总的来说，最终我们知道，这种背景，如果我可以说，是我们的真正爱好者并不真正欣赏的东西，但这并不是那么重要。重要的是确保它尽可能真实，然后与我们提高F1在全球的知名度这一事实相关。

So I think that overall at the end of the day we know that the context of that is also if I may say uh something that the true lovers of our sport do not really appreciate but that's not really so relevant.

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to uh to leadership. So running Formula 1 is that do you think that's the coolest job in Italy or for an Italian to have?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 当然，很多人会排队等着得到这份工作。但那不是我的问题。我的问题是确保我把它当作一项重大的责任。我非常荣幸，我知道这一点。我为此感到非常自豪。但这并非理所当然，因为这是一项艰巨的工作。当然，作为一名意大利人，我能够在汽车世界里工作了将近30年，甚至超过30年，先是在**法拉利**（Ferrari: 意大利豪华跑车制造商及F1车队），然后是**兰博基尼**（Lamborghini: 意大利豪华跑车制造商）的首席执行官，现在又来到F1。我知道这似乎是一个不可思议的故事，但事实就是如此。我唯一能向您保证的是，我没有浪费一秒钟的精力，因为我是第一个到办公室，最后一个离开的人。我环游世界。所以我一点也不觉得痛苦。所以这是一种荣幸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For sure is something that uh there would be a lot of people queuing up out of the office to have it. But that's not my problem. My problem is to make sure that I take that as a big responsibility. I'm very privileged. I know that. I'm very proud of it. But it's not given for granted because it's a big job. And of course as an Italian that I was able to do uh I would say almost 30 more than 30 years in the world of cars with Ferrari then SE of Lamborghini then be here in for one. I know that it seems to be a sort of of a incredible story but it is what it is. The only thing I can guarantee to you that I have not lose any any second of my energy because I'm the first time I'm in the office. I'm the last to leave. I travel all around the world. So I don't feel that pain at all. So it's it's a privilege.</p>

**Stefano:** 非常重要，它让我明白除了赛车运动之外还有另一个世界，而且它对于更好地理解汽车行业也很重要，也让我明白，有时我们F1会认为世界只与F1相关，但事实并非如此。正如我之前所说，我们非常荣幸，但世界非常大，因此那段经历也帮助我之前搬到德国，因为我去了**奥迪**（Audi: 德国豪华汽车品牌），因此我理解了不同的工作方式，不同的与人相处方式，这对我来说很重要，可以理解机制并管理文化复杂性，这是您在这份工作中学习到的事情之一。

<p class="english-text">very important to understand that there is another world not only on the motorsport side of it but it was relevant to understand the automotive industry better and also to understand that uh you know sometimes we as F1 uh believe that the world is only connected to formula one and is not the case we have as I said before we are very privileged but the world is very big and therefore that experience helped me also to move to Germany before because I went to Audi and therefore for understanding there are different way of working different way of relating with people that for me was relevant to understand the mechanism and to manage complexity cultural complexity that is one of the things that you learn when you are in this job.</p>

<p class="english-text">what Can uh we as an investment organization learn from Formula 1 you think?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我认为要放眼大局。您知道，投资有时会正确地关注非常理性的参数。我们试图赋予它一种情感层面，这在理性方法中是不存在的，而我认为这非常相关且非常重要。我认为我们的生态系统是相当横向的，因为您知道，我们有属于不同业务领域的合作伙伴。因此，我想说，如果他们与此相关联，这意味着我们对他们很重要。这意味着从更大的图景来看，人们是否有办法可以投资？

<p class="english-text">Well, I think to think big uh you know investment uh sometimes uh look at correctly are the parameters that are very rational. uh we try to give an emotional side of of of that is not present in the rational approach that I believe is is very relevant and very important and uh I think that our ecosystem is is quite transversal because uh you know we have partners that belongs to different area of the business. Therefore I would say if they are connected with that means that we we we are relevant for them. That means that in term of bigger picture uh is there a way that we can in that people can invest on?</p>

<p class="english-text">What about what about the way you use data? So not not necessarily for the audience and so but just for the the race itself. Well what do you think is most fascinating way you use data?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 我们用数据以一种基本且不复杂的方式解释赛车的性能。这在生活中总是如此，您知道，唯一有吸引力的方式就是用简单的方式解释。所以我们从数据分析中创建图形，以解释我们正在做什么，以便让我们的粉丝更好地理解。这确实是我们已经在做的一项不可思议的资产，我们未来需要进一步加强。

**Nicolai:** 当您看车队时，最优秀的团队在动力学和工作方式上有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you look at the teams um what do the best teams do differently in terms of the dynamics and the way they work?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我认为最优秀的团队，逻辑上，不涉及财务层面，是拥有最佳组织、最佳人才和最佳流程的团队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the best teams have a logically, you know, without getting into the financial dimension of it are the teams that have the best organization, the best people in term of quality and the best the best process.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 好的。我们来谈谈这三点。那么，最优秀的人才，在F1车队中成为优秀人才需要什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Should we do let's do those three. So, uh the best people, what what does it take to be great people in in the teams in Formula 1?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，首先，我从软技能方面开始，您必须拥有能够管理压力的人。在F1中，无论您的级别如何，压力都非常巨大。您可以想象，通常，恕我直言，机械师在比赛过程中有责任在两秒内更换轮胎，这可以决定比赛的胜负。所以，在每个角色中，压力管理都非常重要。然后是团队合作方式，您需要明白，单打独斗您赢不了任何东西。您需要明白您在一个结构非常完善的团队中的位置和责任，然后当然是能力，没有能力，我想说这并非理所当然，但您知道，F1的世界非常特殊，无论您的角色是什么，您都需要非常了解这项业务。所以，这三个要素我认为非常非常重要，当然，您需要热爱并对这份工作充满热情，否则您永远不会去做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I start from a a soft skill approach that has to be you have to have people that are able to manage pressure. The pressure in formula one whatever is your level is huge. Can you imagine you know normally you can say with all respect the mechanic you know mechanic during the course of the race has the the responsibility of changing the tires in two second and this can give you the the the the win or the lose of the race. So at every single role pressure management is very important. Then teamwork approach you you need to understand alone you cannot win anything. You need to understand what is you know your position and your responsibility in a team that has to be very well structured and then of course competences without that I would say is given is not given for granted but you know the world of for one is very specific and you need to know the business very well no matter is your role. So these are the three elements which I believe are very very relevant and of course you need to love and you have the passion of this job otherwise you will never do it.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 速度有多重要？不是指赛道上的速度，而是指作为一个组织的速度？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is speed not on the track but uh speed as an organization?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，速度是我们工作的本质。它不仅仅是指您因为最快而获胜。您获胜是因为作为一个组织，您在所需的最短时间内做出了正确的决定。速度并不意味着您在决策过程中必须狂躁或活跃。速度意味着您需要根据做出决定所需的要素来做出决定。不要过度构建自己以获取更多信息。更多信息只会延迟决策过程。所以，这就是我认为速度的本质。速度意味着以做出决定所需的要素成为最快的。这就是作为一个组织，我们需要预见到世界发展得非常非常快的事实。如果您只是进行逆向工程，您不必回到20年前，只需回到两年前，看看我们当时在哪里，现在事情已经发生了演变。如果您不能及时反应或迅速预测事物，您就会被淘汰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Well speed is the essence of our of our job is not only the reference that uh you know you win because you are the fastest. You win because as an organization you take the right decision in the minimum time that is required. Mhm. Speed doesn't mean that you have to be frantic or or active in your decision process making. Speed means that you need to take decision with the element that you need to make the decision. Not to over structure yourself in actually more information. More information to delay the process of a decision. So this is what I believe is the essence of speed. Speed means to be the fastest with the elements that you need to make a decision. And that's where as an organization we need to you know to anticipate the fact that the world is running very very fast. If you do just reverse engineering you don't have to go 20 years ago but just two years ago where we were and and now the things has evolved. If you're not able to react or promptly anticipate the things you're out of the business.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您如何确保您的组织不会放慢速度？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you make sure that you don't slow down as an organization?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 首先，确保组织中的每个人都处于“记录模式”，以理解并获取正确的信息。其次，要有一个分享和让人们跟上需求进度的流程。第三，对我来说最重要的是，您知道，当您做这份工作时，需要100%全速前进，没有任何放松的时刻，因为您无法承受。因此，这是一个非常紧张的工作，但您应该拥有的这种强度和活力必须传递给您的团队，否则一个人是很难的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all uh to make sure that every every single people organization uh is in record mode to understand listen having the right information. Secondly to have a process of of sharing and and keeping the people up to speed to what is this need and third that is for me the most important thing that you know when you do this job is 100% full speed without any moment of relax because you cannot take it. therefore is a very intense but the intensity and the energetic approach that you should have has to be transferred to your people otherwise alone is is very difficult.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您如何做到这一点？您如何传递这种心态？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how do you do that how do you transmit that mindset with the with example and how for instance what um</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 通过榜样。我的意思是，我是第一个到办公室的，我希望立即召开我想要的会议，如果他们跟不上我的节奏，那是他们的问题，不是我的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know the first to arrive and I want to have immediately the meeting of the people in the way that I want and if I'm not able to go with my rhythm is their problem not mine</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您现在比过去更快了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">are you faster now than you were uh in the past</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 更快了，是的，绝对是。所以我认为，通过经验，我学会了如何管理速度，我知道何时需要全速前进，何时需要刹车。这是一个管理者需要很好理解的，他需要了解周围的人。您知道，如果马匹还没有准备好，您就不能毁掉它们。所以这是一个微调的问题，需要对您的生态系统有正确的理解，如果您想长期领导这个组织，这就是您必须做的正确事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">faster yes definitely so I think that with the experience I've learned how to manage the speed in a way that I know how when I need to use the full throttle or when I need to break that's the good understanding of a manager that needs to understand who is the people around him you know you cannot destroy your horses if the horses are not ready for that so it's a matter of of fine-tuning and having the right understanding of your ecosystem and that's will be you know the the right thing that you have to do if you if you want to lead the organization for a long term</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您什么时候……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when do you</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 夏季，唯一的慢速时间是八月的两周假期和圣诞节的两周假期，那是我唯一会休息的时刻。所以只有一种速度，那就是100%全速前进，毫无疑问。但我认为在世界各地，如果您想成为我们所做事情的主角，就只有全速前进。

<details>

<p class="english-text">uh summer time the only slow time is when we have a you know two weeks on holiday in August and two weeks on holiday in Christmas time and that's that's the only moment where I will will break so there's only one speed that's full speed 100% for one there's no doubt but I I think that all around the world if you want to be a protagonist of what we are doing there is only full speed.</p>

**Nicolai:** 当您审视社会时，您是否惊讶它没有发展得更快？

<details>

<p class="english-text">when you look at society are you surprised that it's not going faster</p>

<p class="english-text">So, in your private life, I mean, how I mean, if I were to be your wife, I mean, mama, I'm I'm</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 感谢上帝。我与我的妻子结婚多年，非常幸福。我有两个孩子。我认为家里发展得足够快了。感谢上帝，我有一个比我更快的妻子。但这就是我，我的意思是，我只是专注于工作之外的事情。我专注于我的家庭和我的朋友，他们从高中时代就一直是我朋友。所以这是我与过去的传承，它让我脚踏实地，对我来说这非常重要。

<p class="english-text">thanks God. I'm very happy with my wife since many, many, many, many years. I got two children. I think it's moving fast enough at home. Thanks God I have a wife that is faster than me. So, but that's the, you know, that's me. I mean, I I'm just focused out of the business. I'm focused on my family and with my friends that are the same since I was in high school. So that's my legacy with my past that keep me with the feet on the ground and for me that is very important.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您知道，这似乎是意大利人的共同点。友谊可以追溯到很久以前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know it seems to be a common denominator with Italians. Friendships go back quite far.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，对我们来说，这是一种我们被塑造的方式。我们出生并成长，我们的社区对我们来说非常重要，这不是一种主观评论，而是一个事实。因此，您知道，当您处于这个位置时，您可能会迷失自我，因为您会遇到世界上所有重要的人，但最终当您独自一人站在镜子前时，您就是您自己。因此，对我来说，要保持这种状态，我需要回到我告诉您的正常生活，就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well for us is is a sort of the way we were built. We were born and our community is very important for us and it's not a qualitative comment. is a fact and therefore you know when you are in this position you can be taken away because you meet all the most important people of the world but at the end of the day when you are alone uh in front of the mirror you are yourself and therefore for me to be like this I need to go back to my normal life that is what I told you and that's it.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您如何确定优先级？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you prioritize</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，在时间方面，我知道在我的工作日中，优先级是业务，但当我在家时，我希望给我的孩子（孩子已经长大了，但仍然是孩子）和我的妻子10000%的优质时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well priorities in term of of of of of time I know that uh you know during my work day in the priority is the business but when I'm At home, I want to give quality time to my my kids, kids already bigger, but the kids and my wife 10,000%.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 那么在工作中，您如何确定优先级？您早上来上班，如何确定要做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in at work, how do you prioritize? You come in, you come in in the morning, how do you prioritize what to do?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 我……嗯，这取决于。因为您知道吗？我一直在思考这个问题。我认为我们太不擅长确定什么重要了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I Well, depends. Because you know what? I I've been thinking a lot about it. And I think we just are too bad at prioritizing what's important.</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，优先级是让您高效和有效的原因，因为不幸的是，当您有太多事情要做时，您需要明白哪些是您需要完成的优先事项。战略性的、战术性的，因此，这不是我早上做的事情。我的意思是，早上我已经在行动模式了。我需要做的是确保我以不同的方式确定优先级，长期、中期、每周，我必须确保我清楚地知道我需要完成什么，我正在为自己做什么，这是我用来提高效率的方法，每天晚上我都会计算我做出的决定是否足够，这不是一个数字，但可以说，我今天做出决定了吗？在我的位置上，在我们的位置上，您每天都需要做出决定。如果您没有做出决定，这意味着，要么其他人做得比您好，这在某种程度上可能很好，我不知道，但否则您就没有达到您应有的表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the priority is the is is what makes the you efficient and effective because unfortunately when you go you have so many things to do, then you need to understand what are the priority you need to bring home. strategic, tactical and therefore is a matter of I'm I'm not doing that in the morning. I mean in the morning I'm already on action mode. what I need to do is to make sure that I prioritarize you know in a different way uh long-term medium-term weekly term and and and and I I have to make sure that I have a clear understanding what I need to bring home what I'm doing to myself and this is something that I use for me to be effective is every evening I count the the decision that I've taken is enough or not enough is not a number but let's say Did I take decision today? In my position, in our position, every day you need to take decision. If you're not taking decision means that uh either you know people have done your job better, that is good in a way maybe, I don't know, but otherwise you are not performing the way that you should.</p>
</details>

**Nicolai:** 您的决策方式有何改变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How has your decision- making changed?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 决策方式当然随着经验而改变，随着我现在希望更成熟一些，不再犯错，即使我将错误也纳入我们正在做的事情的流程中，这也是我们生活的一部分。您知道，顺便说一句，在这里我们也有不同的文化方法，如果您以我们意大利人的方法为例，错误总是被视为“哦，天哪，您不能失败，否则就是灾难”，如果您采用美国人的心态，美国人的心态是“如果您不失败，您就一无是处”。因此，如何将两者结合起来是相关的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The decision making has changed of course with the experience uh with the fact that now hopefully I am a little more mature not to make mistakes even if I put in the process of what we're doing also mistakes it's part of our life you know it's it's a by the way also here we have a different cultural approach if you take the example of our you know approach as an Italian mistake has been always seen as oh my god you cannot fail otherwise it's a disaster you go with the American mentality the American mentality failure if you don't fail you are no one.

</details>

**Stefano:** 我认为这只是一个理解您所犯错误的严重程度的问题，并尝试，如果您觉得您犯了错误，如何纠正它，就这么简单。非常简单。我不需要把它复杂化。如果我觉得我们，我总是说“我们”，因为这不是一个组织的回应。如果我的一些人犯了错误，那是我的错。我认为唯一要做的就是纠正它。如果我们看到人们不理解这一点，那么对我来说，这就是改变它的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much time do you spend on debriefs every week after after</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 这是我工作流程的一部分。我的意思是，每次活动之后都必须进行事后总结，这就是F1教给您的。在我们的案例中，每次活动都有一个适当的事后总结，每个人都必须通过一个清单来了解我们是否做对了事情，或者我们做错了什么，以及我们需要纠正什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you make sure that there is a good feedback system that people tell you the truth?</p>
</details>

**Stefano:** 嗯，当然有一个分享真实信息的流程。这是一种您通过了解不同的渠道来建立力量的方式。您需要知道或您应该尝试了解您周围的一切，并在正确的时间使用这些信息。所以，再一次，这是一个深入了解您可以真正100%信任谁、50%信任谁、30%信任谁的问题，并确保您掌控着相关的生态系统。

<details>

So once again is a matter of uh deeply understanding who you can really rely 100% who 50% who 30% and and make sure that you have the ecosystem under control that is relevant for sure.</p>

**Stefano:** 嗯，我确实认为我工作中最复杂的部分是确保，您知道，这份工作分为许多不同的领域。有一个领域与广播公司关系相关，一个领域与推广商关系相关，一个领域与车队关系相关，一个领域与国际汽联关系相关。最重要的是，我的工作是确保我们的组织顺利运行。所以，所有这些事情的复杂性在于管理工作团队的质量。这是我的组织。其次是管理他们在不同背景下必须拥有的不同关系，这些关系相当复杂。所以我不能说只有一个，它是多方面的，但方法总是一样的。尝试理解，尝试倾听，尝试理解是否有我需要理解的幕后事情，当我们谈论某些事情时，并做出判断。

**Stefano:** 嗯，首先，我不是教授，也不是老师。我只是想分享我认为重要的、我亲身经历的事情。我的意思是，当您年轻时，您需要思考，我认为您需要思考，未来的事物正在成为机会，而这些机会，当您变老时，梦想将被视为问题。所以，保持专注，保持年轻的心态，放眼大局，相信自己，永不放弃，保持专注，努力工作。努力工作意味着您需要专注于您所热爱的事情，并且知道竞争非常激烈，而且我想说今天更强大，因为它更具横向性，更国际化，但如果您相信自己，就没有理由不去做。所以，真正相信自己，保持谦逊，倾听，尝试理解并向周围的每个人学习，这将是我的基本建议。作为一个60岁的人，在F1和这份工作中，我正在变老。不，可以说，在F1工作一年相当于正常生活的10年。所以，这就是我作为与我们的听众朋友分享的经验。

<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I'm not a professor. I'm not a teacher. I just really can share what uh what I believe is important that I live in my own. I mean when you're young you need to think and and I think that uh you need to think that uh things in the future are becoming opportunities and the opportunities instead of being opportunities the dreams will be seen as problems when you're getting older. So stay focused on be younger to think that to think big to think that you need to be to believe in yourself not to give up stay focused and and work hard. work hard means uh you you need to stay dedicated to what you love and and knowing that the competition is very tight and very I would say stronger today because it's more transversal more international but if you believe in yourself there's no reason why you shouldn't do it so really believe in yourself being humble listen try to understand and to learn from everyone is around you this would be my basic uh I would say advice M as a 60 years man that has been in for one and in this job that is getting older. No let's say one year in for one is around 10 years of a normal life. So that's what I'm saying as a shared shared experience with with our friends that listen to us.</p>
