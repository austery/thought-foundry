### 逻辑斯蒂映射：从简单模型到稳定平衡

假设你想模拟一个兔子种群：如果今年有X只兔子，明年会有多少只？最简单的模型就是用一个数字，即**增长率**（growth rate）R（比如2）来乘以X，这意味着种群数量每年都会翻倍。但问题是，这意味着兔子数量将永远呈指数级增长。

<p class="english-text">Let's say you want to model a population of rabbits if you have X rabbits this year how many rabbits will you have next year well the simplest model I can imagine is where we just multiplied by some number the growth rate R which could be say 2 and this would mean the population would double every year and the problem with that is it means the number of rabbits would grow exponentially forever so I can add the term 1 minus X to represent the constraints of the environment and here I'm imagining the population X is a percentage of the theoretical maximum so it goes from 0 to 1 and as it approaches that maximum then this term goes to 0 and that constrains the population so this is the logistic map xn plus 1 is the population next year and xn is the population this year and if you graph the population next year versus the population this year you see it is just an inverted parabola it's the simplest equation you can make that has a negative feedback loop the bigger the population gets over here the smaller it'll be the following year so let's try an example let's say we're dealing with a particularly active group of rabbits so R equals two point six and then let's pick a starting population of 40% of the maximum so point four and then times 1 minus 0.4 and we get 0.62 four okay so the population increased in the first year but what we're really interested in is the long term behavior of this population so we can put this population back into the equation and to speed things up you can actually type two point six times answer times one - answer get point six one so the population dropped a little hit it again point six one nine point six one three point six one seven point six one five point six one six point six one five and if I keep hitting Enter here you see that the population doesn't really change it has stabilized which matches what we see in the wild populations often remain the same as long as births and deaths are balanced now I want to make a graph of this iteration you can see here that it's reached an equilibrium value of point six one five now what would happen if I change the initial population I'm just going to move this slider here and what you see is the first few years change but the equilibrium population remains the same so we can basically ignore the initial population so what I'm really interested in is how does this equilibrium population vary depending on are the growth rate so as you can see if I lower the growth rate the equilibrium population decreases that makes sense and in fact if R goes below one well then the population drops and eventually goes extinct so what I want to do is make another graph where on the x axis I have R the growth rate and on the y axis I'm plotting the equilibrium population the population you get after many many many generations okay for low values of R we see the populations always go extinct so the equilibrium value is zero but once our hits 1 the population stabilizes on to a constant value and the higher R is the higher the equilibrium population</p>

为了模拟环境的限制，我们可以添加一个1减X的项。在这里，我将种群X设为理论最大值的百分比，范围从0到1。当X接近最大值时，这个项趋近于0，从而限制了种群数量。这就是**逻辑斯蒂映射**（logistic map）：Xn+1代表明年的种群数量，Xn代表今年的种群数量。如果你绘制明年种群数量与今年种群数量的图，你会看到它只是一个倒置的抛物线。这是你能构建的最简单的具有**负反馈**（negative feedback: 系统输出会反过来影响输入，从而抑制或调节系统行为）循环的方程：种群越大，下一年就会越小。

<p class="english-text">so I can add the term 1 minus X to represent the constraints of the environment and here I'm imagining the population X is a percentage of the theoretical maximum so it goes from 0 to 1 and as it approaches that maximum then this term goes to 0 and that constrains the population so this is the logistic map xn plus 1 is the population next year and xn is the population this year and if you graph the population next year versus the population this year you see it is just an inverted parabola it's the simplest equation you can make that has a negative feedback loop the bigger the population gets over here the smaller it'll be the following year so let's try an example let's say we're dealing with a particularly active group of rabbits so R equals two point six and then let's pick a starting population of 40% of the maximum so point four and then times 1 minus 0.4 and we get 0.62 four okay so the population increased in the first year but what we're really interested in is the long term behavior of this population so we can put this population back into the equation and to speed things up you can actually type two point six times answer times one - answer get point six one so the population dropped a little hit it again point six one nine point six one three point six one seven point six one five point six one six point six one five and if I keep hitting Enter here you see that the population doesn't really change it has stabilized which matches what we see in the wild populations often remain the same as long as births and deaths are balanced now I want to make a graph of this iteration you can see here that it's reached an equilibrium value of point six one five now what would happen if I change the initial population I'm just going to move this slider here and what you see is the first few years change but the equilibrium population remains the same so we can basically ignore the initial population so what I'm really interested in is how does this equilibrium population vary depending on are the growth rate so as you can see if I lower the growth rate the equilibrium population decreases that makes sense and in fact if R goes below one well then the population drops and eventually goes extinct so what I want to do is make another graph where on the x axis I have R the growth rate and on the y axis I'm plotting the equilibrium population the population you get after many many many generations okay for low values of R we see the populations always go extinct so the equilibrium value is zero but once our hits 1 the population stabilizes on to a constant value and the higher R is the higher the equilibrium population</p>

让我们举个例子，假设我们正在处理一群特别活跃的兔子，所以R等于2.6。然后我们选择初始种群为最大值的40%，即0.4，再乘以1减0.4，得到0.624。好的，第一年种群数量增加了。但我们真正感兴趣的是这个种群的长期行为。我们可以将这个种群数量代回方程，为了加快速度，你可以输入2.6乘以答案再乘以1减答案，得到0.61。种群数量略有下降，再按一次，得到0.619、0.613、0.617、0.615、0.616、0.615。如果我一直按回车键，你会发现种群数量并没有真正改变，它已经稳定下来了，这与我们在野外观察到的情况相符：只要出生和死亡保持平衡，种群数量通常会保持不变。

</details>

现在我想制作一个迭代图。你可以看到它已经达到了0.615的**均衡值**（equilibrium value: 系统在没有外部干扰下趋于稳定的状态）。如果我改变初始种群数量会发生什么？我只是移动一下这个滑块，你会看到前几年有所变化，但均衡种群数量保持不变。所以我们可以基本忽略初始种群数量。我真正感兴趣的是，这个均衡种群数量如何随着增长率R的变化而变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I want to make a graph of this iteration you can see here that it's reached an equilibrium value of point six one five now what would happen if I change the initial population I'm just going to move this slider here and what you see is the first few years change but the equilibrium population remains the same so we can basically ignore the initial population so what I'm really interested in is how does this equilibrium population vary depending on are the growth rate so as you can see if I lower the growth rate the equilibrium population decreases that makes sense and in fact if R goes below one well then the population drops and eventually goes extinct so what I want to do is make another graph where on the x axis I have R the growth rate and on the y axis I'm plotting the equilibrium population the population you get after many many many generations okay for low values of R we see the populations always go extinct so the equilibrium value is zero but once our hits 1 the population stabilizes on to a constant value and the higher R is the higher the equilibrium population</p>
</details>

正如你所看到的，如果我降低增长率，均衡种群数量会减少，这很合理。事实上，如果R低于1，那么种群数量会下降并最终灭绝。所以我想制作另一个图，其中X轴是增长率R，Y轴是均衡种群数量，也就是经过许多代之后你得到的种群数量。好的，对于较低的R值，我们看到种群总是灭绝，所以均衡值为零。但一旦R达到1，种群就会稳定在一个常数值上，R越高，均衡种群数量也越高。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so as you can see if I lower the growth rate the equilibrium population decreases that makes sense and in fact if R goes below one well then the population drops and eventually goes extinct so what I want to do is make another graph where on the x axis I have R the growth rate and on the y axis I'm plotting the equilibrium population the population you get after many many many generations okay for low values of R we see the populations always go extinct so the equilibrium value is zero but once our hits 1 the population stabilizes on to a constant value and the higher R is the higher the equilibrium population</p>

### 周期倍增与混沌的诞生

到目前为止一切顺利，但现在奇怪的部分来了。一旦R超过3，图表就会一分为二。为什么会这样？发生了什么？无论你迭代方程多少次，它都不会稳定在一个单一的常数值上，而是会在两个值之间来回振荡。一年种群数量较高，下一年较低，然后循环重复。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so far so good but now comes the weird part once our passes three the graph splits in two why what's happening well no matter how many times you iterate the equation it never settles on to a single constant value instead it oscillates back and forth between two values one year the population is higher the next year lower and then the cycle repeats the cyclic nature of populations is observed in nature too one year there might be more rabbits and then fewer the next year and more again the year after as our continues to increase the fork spreads apart and then each one splits again now instead of oscillating back and forth between two values populations go through a four year cycle before repeating since the length of the cycle or period has doubled these are known as period doubling bifurcation z' and as R increases further there are more period doubling bifurcation z' they come faster and faster leading to cycles of 8 16 32 64 and then at R equals three point five seven chaos the population never settles down at all it bounces around as if at random in fact this equation provided one of the first methods of generating random numbers on computers it was a way to get something unpredictable from a deterministic machine there is no pattern here no repeating of course if you did know the exact initial conditions you could calculate the values exactly so they are considered only pseudo-random numbers now you might expect the equation to be chaotic from here on out but as R increases order returns there are these windows of stable periodic behavior amid the chaos for example at R equals 3 point 8 3 there is a stable cycle with a period of 3 years and as R continues to increase it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before returning to chaos in fact this one equation contains periods of every length 3750 1052 whatever you like if you just have the right value</p>
</details>

种群的周期性在自然界中也能观察到：一年兔子可能更多，下一年更少，再下一年又更多。随着R的持续增加，分叉会分开，然后每个分支再次分裂。现在，种群不再在两个值之间来回振荡，而是经历一个四年周期后重复。由于循环的长度或周期翻倍了，这些被称为**周期倍增分岔**（period doubling bifurcations: 系统行为从一个稳定状态分裂成两个或更多稳定状态的现象）。随着R进一步增加，会有更多的周期倍增分岔，它们来得越来越快，导致8、16、32、64的循环。

<p class="english-text">the cyclic nature of populations is observed in nature too one year there might be more rabbits and then fewer the next year and more again the year after as our continues to increase the fork spreads apart and then each one splits again now instead of oscillating back and forth between two values populations go through a four year cycle before repeating since the length of the cycle or period has doubled these are known as period doubling bifurcation z' and as R increases further there are more period doubling bifurcation z' they come faster and faster leading to cycles of 8 16 32 64 and then at R equals three point five seven chaos the population never settles down at all it bounces around as if at random in fact this equation provided one of the first methods of generating random numbers on computers it was a way to get something unpredictable from a deterministic machine there is no pattern here no repeating of course if you did know the exact initial conditions you could calculate the values exactly so they are considered only pseudo-random numbers now you might expect the equation to be chaotic from here on out but as R increases order returns there are these windows of stable periodic behavior amid the chaos for example at R equals 3 point 8 3 there is a stable cycle with a period of 3 years and as R continues to increase it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before returning to chaos in fact this one equation contains periods of every length 3750 1052 whatever you like if you just have the right value</p>
</details>

然后，当R等于3.57时，**混沌**（chaos: 系统对初始条件极其敏感，导致其长期行为不可预测的现象）出现。种群根本不会稳定下来，它会像随机一样跳动。事实上，这个方程提供了计算机上生成**伪随机数**（pseudo-random numbers: 通过确定性算法生成，但在统计学上表现出随机性的数列）的最早方法之一。它是一种从确定性机器中获得不可预测结果的方法。这里没有模式，没有重复。当然，如果你确实知道精确的初始条件，你可以精确计算出这些值，所以它们只被认为是伪随机数。

<p class="english-text">and then at R equals three point five seven chaos the population never settles down at all it bounces around as if at random in fact this equation provided one of the first methods of generating random numbers on computers it was a way to get something unpredictable from a deterministic machine there is no pattern here no repeating of course if you did know the exact initial conditions you could calculate the values exactly so they are considered only pseudo-random numbers now you might expect the equation to be chaotic from here on out but as R increases order returns there are these windows of stable periodic behavior amid the chaos for example at R equals 3 point 8 3 there is a stable cycle with a period of 3 years and as R continues to increase it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before returning to chaos in fact this one equation contains periods of every length 3750 1052 whatever you like if you just have the right value</p>
</details>

你可能会认为从这里开始方程将一直处于混沌状态，但随着R的增加，秩序又会回来。在混沌中存在着这些稳定周期性行为的“窗口”。例如，当R等于3.83时，存在一个周期为3年的稳定循环。随着R的持续增加，它会分裂成6、12、24等，然后再次回到混沌。事实上，这一个方程包含了所有长度的周期，无论是3、7、50、1052，只要你找到合适的R值，你就能得到。

<p class="english-text">now you might expect the equation to be chaotic from here on out but as R increases order returns there are these windows of stable periodic behavior amid the chaos for example at R equals 3 point 8 3 there is a stable cycle with a period of 3 years and as R continues to increase it splits into 6 12 24 and so on before returning to chaos in fact this one equation contains periods of every length 3750 1052 whatever you like if you just have the right value</p>

### 分岔图与曼德尔布罗特集

当你观察这个分岔图时，你可能会注意到它看起来像一个**分形**（fractal: 具有自相似性质的几何形状，无论放大多少倍，其局部都与整体相似）。大尺度的特征似乎在越来越小的尺度上重复出现，果然，如果你放大，你会发现它确实是一个分形。可以说，最著名的分形是**曼德尔布罗特集**。这里的“剧情反转”是，分岔图实际上是曼德尔布罗特集的一部分。

<p class="english-text">are looking at this bifurcation diagram you may notice that it looks like a fractal the large-scale features look to be repeated on smaller and smaller scales and sure enough if you zoom in you see that it is in fact a fractal arguably the most famous fractal is the Mandelbrot set the plot twist here is that the bifurcation diagram is actually part of the Mandelbrot set how does that work well quick recap on the Mandelbrot set it is based on this iterated equation so the way it works is you pick a number C any number in the complex plane and then start with Z equals 0 and then iterate this equation over and over again if it blows up to infinity well then the number C is not part of the set but if this number remains finite after unlimited iterations well then it is part of the Mandelbrot set so let's try for example C equals 1 so we've got 0 squared plus 1 equals 1 then 1 squared plus 1 equals 2 2 squared plus 1 equals 5 5 squared plus 1 equals 26 so pretty quickly you can see that with C equals 1 this equation is going to blow up so the number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot set what if we try C equals negative 1 well then we've got 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 negative 1 squared minus 1 equals 0 and so we're back to 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 so we see that this function is going to keep oscillating back and forth between negative 1 and 0 and so it'll remain finite and so C equals negative 1 is part of the Mandelbrot set now normally when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot set it just shows you the boundary between the numbers that cause this iterated equation to remain finite and those that cause it to blow up but it doesn't really show you how these numbers stay finite so what we've done here is actually iterated that equation thousands of times and then plotted on the z axis the value that that iteration actually takes so if we look from the side what you'll actually see is the bifurcation diagram it is part of this Mandelbrot set so what's really going on here well what this is showing us is that all of the numbers in the main cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a single constant value but the numbers in this main bulb will they end up oscillating back and forth between two values and in this bulb they end up oscillating between four values they've got a period of four and then eight and then 16 32 and so on and then you hit the chaotic part the chaotic part of the bifurcation diagram happens out here on what's called the needle of the Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set gets really thin and you can see this medallion here that looks like a smaller version of the entire Mandelbrot set well that corresponds to the window of stability in the bifurcation plot with a period of three now the bifurcation diagram only exists on the real line because we only put real numbers into our equation but all of these bulbs off of the main cardioid well they also have periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or 5 and so you see these repeated ghostly images if we look in the z axis effectively they're oscillating between these values as well</p>
</details>

这如何运作？快速回顾一下曼德尔布罗特集，它是基于这个**迭代方程**（iterated equation: 重复应用一个函数或公式到其自身输出的方程）的。它的工作方式是，你选择一个数字C，**复平面**（complex plane: 用实轴和虚轴表示复数的平面）上的任何数字，然后从Z等于0开始，然后一遍又一遍地迭代这个方程。如果它趋于无穷大，那么数字C就不属于这个集合；但如果这个数字在无限次迭代后仍然有限，那么它就属于曼德尔布罗特集。

<p class="english-text">how does that work well quick recap on the Mandelbrot set it is based on this iterated equation so the way it works is you pick a number C any number in the complex plane and then start with Z equals 0 and then iterate this equation over and over again if it blows up to infinity well then the number C is not part of the set but if this number remains finite after unlimited iterations well then it is part of the Mandelbrot set so let's try for example C equals 1 so we've got 0 squared plus 1 equals 1 then 1 squared plus 1 equals 2 2 squared plus 1 equals 5 5 squared plus 1 equals 26 so pretty quickly you can see that with C equals 1 this equation is going to blow up so the number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot set what if we try C equals negative 1 well then we've got 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 negative 1 squared minus 1 equals 0 and so we're back to 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 so we see that this function is going to keep oscillating back and forth between negative 1 and 0 and so it'll remain finite and so C equals negative 1 is part of the Mandelbrot set now normally when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot set it just shows you the boundary between the numbers that cause this iterated equation to remain finite and those that cause it to blow up but it doesn't really show you how these numbers stay finite so what we've done here is actually iterated that equation thousands of times and then plotted on the z axis the value that that iteration actually takes so if we look from the side what you'll actually see is the bifurcation diagram it is part of this Mandelbrot set so what's really going on here well what this is showing us is that all of the numbers in the main cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a single constant value but the numbers in this main bulb will they end up oscillating back and forth between two values and in this bulb they end up oscillating between four values they've got a period of four and then eight and then 16 32 and so on and then you hit the chaotic part the chaotic part of the bifurcation diagram happens out here on what's called the needle of the Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set gets really thin and you can see this medallion here that looks like a smaller version of the entire Mandelbrot set well that corresponds to the window of stability in the bifurcation plot with a period of three now the bifurcation diagram only exists on the real line because we only put real numbers into our equation but all of these bulbs off of the main cardioid well they also have periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or 5 and so you see these repeated ghostly images if we look in the z axis effectively they're oscillating between these values as well</p>
</details>

例如，我们尝试C等于1，那么我们有0的平方加1等于1，然后1的平方加1等于2，2的平方加1等于5，5的平方加1等于26。所以很快你就能看到，当C等于1时，这个方程会趋于无穷大，因此数字1不属于曼德尔布罗特集。如果我们尝试C等于负1呢？那么我们有0的平方减1等于负1，负1的平方减1等于0，然后我们又回到0的平方减1等于负1。所以我们看到这个函数会在负1和0之间来回振荡，因此它会保持有限，所以C等于负1是曼德尔布罗特集的一部分。

<p class="english-text">so let's try for example C equals 1 so we've got 0 squared plus 1 equals 1 then 1 squared plus 1 equals 2 2 squared plus 1 equals 5 5 squared plus 1 equals 26 so pretty quickly you can see that with C equals 1 this equation is going to blow up so the number 1 is not part of the Mandelbrot set what if we try C equals negative 1 well then we've got 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 negative 1 squared minus 1 equals 0 and so we're back to 0 squared minus 1 equals negative 1 so we see that this function is going to keep oscillating back and forth between negative 1 and 0 and so it'll remain finite and so C equals negative 1 is part of the Mandelbrot set now normally when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot set it just shows you the boundary between the numbers that cause this iterated equation to remain finite and those that cause it to blow up but it doesn't really show you how these numbers stay finite so what we've done here is actually iterated that equation thousands of times and then plotted on the z axis the value that that iteration actually takes so if we look from the side what you'll actually see is the bifurcation diagram it is part of this Mandelbrot set so what's really going on here well what this is showing us is that all of the numbers in the main cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a single constant value but the numbers in this main bulb will they end up oscillating back and forth between two values and in this bulb they end up oscillating between four values they've got a period of four and then eight and then 16 32 and so on and then you hit the chaotic part the chaotic part of the bifurcation diagram happens out here on what's called the needle of the Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set gets really thin and you can see this medallion here that looks like a smaller version of the entire Mandelbrot set well that corresponds to the window of stability in the bifurcation plot with a period of three now the bifurcation diagram only exists on the real line because we only put real numbers into our equation but all of these bulbs off of the main cardioid well they also have periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or 5 and so you see these repeated ghostly images if we look in the z axis effectively they're oscillating between these values as well</p>

通常，当你看到曼德尔布罗特集图片时，它只显示了导致这个迭代方程保持有限的数字与导致它趋于无穷大的数字之间的边界，但它并没有真正展示这些数字是如何保持有限的。所以我们在这里所做的实际上是迭代了那个方程数千次，然后将迭代实际取的值绘制在Z轴上。如果我们从侧面看，你实际上会看到分岔图，它是曼德尔布罗特集的一部分。

<p class="english-text">now normally when you see pictures of the Mandelbrot set it just shows you the boundary between the numbers that cause this iterated equation to remain finite and those that cause it to blow up but it doesn't really show you how these numbers stay finite so what we've done here is actually iterated that equation thousands of times and then plotted on the z axis the value that that iteration actually takes so if we look from the side what you'll actually see is the bifurcation diagram it is part of this Mandelbrot set so what's really going on here well what this is showing us is that all of the numbers in the main cardioid they end up stabilizing on to a single constant value but the numbers in this main bulb will they end up oscillating back and forth between two values and in this bulb they end up oscillating between four values they've got a period of four and then eight and then 16 32 and so on and then you hit the chaotic part the chaotic part of the bifurcation diagram happens out here on what's called the needle of the Mandelbrot set where the Mandelbrot set gets really thin and you can see this medallion here that looks like a smaller version of the entire Mandelbrot set well that corresponds to the window of stability in the bifurcation plot with a period of three now the bifurcation diagram only exists on the real line because we only put real numbers into our equation but all of these bulbs off of the main cardioid well they also have periodic cycles of for example 3 or 4 or 5 and so you see these repeated ghostly images if we look in the z axis effectively they're oscillating between these values as well</p>

那么这里到底发生了什么？这向我们展示的是，主**心形线**（cardioid: 一种心形的数学曲线）中的所有数字最终都会稳定在一个单一的常数值上，但这个主球体中的数字最终会在两个值之间来回振荡。而在这个球体中，它们最终会在四个值之间振荡，它们的周期是四，然后是八，然后是16、32等等，然后你就进入了混沌部分。分岔图的混沌部分发生在曼德尔布罗特集被称为“针”的地方，那里曼德尔布罗特集变得非常细。你可以看到这里有一个看起来像整个曼德尔布罗特集缩小版的小奖章，它对应着分岔图中周期为三的稳定窗口。现在，分岔图只存在于实数线上，因为我们只将实数代入方程，但主心形线之外的所有这些球体也具有周期性循环，例如周期为3、4或5。因此，如果我们沿着Z轴看，你会看到这些重复的幽灵般的图像，它们实际上也在这些值之间振荡。

### 逻辑斯蒂映射的普适性与现实世界应用

第一个主要的实验证实来自一位名叫Lib Taber的**流体动力学**（fluid dynamics: 研究流体运动和其与固体边界相互作用的科学）专家。他制作了一个内部装有水银的小矩形盒子，并使用小的温度梯度来引发**对流**（convection: 流体中热量通过物质运动进行传递的现象），盒子里只有两个反向旋转的流体圆柱体，盒子也只够容纳这些。当然，他无法看到流体在做什么，所以他使用探头测量顶部的温度。他看到的是温度的规律性周期性尖峰，这就像逻辑斯蒂方程收敛到一个单一值时的情况。

但随着他增加温度梯度，那些旋转的圆柱体上出现了半个原始频率的摆动。温度的尖峰不再是相同的高度，而是来回在两个不同高度之间变化。他实现了周期二。随着他继续增加温度，他又看到了周期倍增。现在，在循环重复之前，他有四种不同的温度，然后是八种。这是对理论的一个相当惊人的证实，在一个精心设计的实验中。但这仅仅是个开始。

科学家们研究了我们眼睛和蝾螈眼睛对闪烁光的反应，他们发现一旦光的闪烁速率达到一定程度，就会出现周期倍增，我们的眼睛只对每隔一次的闪烁做出反应。在这些论文中看到分岔图的出现令人惊叹，尽管由于来自真实世界的数据，它有点模糊。在另一项研究中，科学家给兔子注射了一种药物，使它们的心脏进入**颤动**（fibrillation: 心脏不规则、无效率地跳动，无法有效泵血）。

我猜他们觉得兔子太多了。如果你不知道什么是颤动，它指的是你的心脏以一种极其不规则的方式跳动，并且不能真正泵血，所以如果你不及时纠正，你就会死亡。但他们发现，在通往颤动的道路上，他们发现了通往混沌的周期倍增路径。兔子最初是周期性心跳，然后进入两周期，两次心跳紧密相连，然后是四周期，四次不同的心跳之后才重复，最终出现非周期性行为。

这项研究真正酷的地方在于，他们实时监测心脏，并利用混沌理论来确定何时对心脏施加电击，使其恢复周期性，并且他们成功地做到了这一点。所以他们利用混沌来控制心脏，并找到了一种更智能的方法来施加电击，使其再次正常跳动，这非常了不起。

然后是滴水水龙头的问题。我们大多数人当然认为滴水水龙头是非常规律的周期性物体，但大量研究发现，一旦流速稍微增加一点，你就会得到周期倍增，所以现在水滴会一次两滴地落下，最终，通过调节流速，你可以从滴水水龙头中获得混沌行为。你可能会想，水龙头到底是什么？它有恒定的水压和恒定大小的孔径，然而你得到的是混沌的滴水。所以这是一个非常容易在家中进行实验的混沌系统。去把水龙头稍微打开一点，看看你家是否能得到周期性的滴水。

### 费根鲍姆常数与普适性原则

分岔图出现在如此多不同的地方，以至于它开始让人感到诡异，我想告诉你一些会使其看起来更诡异的事情。有一位名叫**米切尔·费根鲍姆**（Mitchell Feigenbaum）的物理学家，他研究了分岔发生的时间。他将每个分岔部分的宽度除以下一个分岔部分的宽度，发现这个比率趋近于4.669这个数字，现在被称为**费根鲍姆常数**（Feigenbaum constant: 一个数学常数，描述了许多非线性系统从有序到混沌的转变过程中周期倍增分岔的普适性）。

<p class="english-text">the bifurcation diagram pops up in so many different places that it starts to feel spooky and I want to tell you something that'll make it seem even spookier there was this physicist Mitchell Feigenbaum who was looking at when the bifurcations occur he divided the width of each bifurcation section by the next one and he found that ratio closed in on this number four point six six nine which is now called the Feigenbaum constant the bifurcations come faster and faster but in a ratio that approaches this fixed value and no one knows where this constant comes from it doesn't seem to relate to any other known physical constant so it is itself a fundamental constant of nature what's even crazier is that it doesn't have to be the particular form of the equation I showed you earlier any equation that has a single hump if you iterate it the way that we have so you could use xn plus 1 equals sine X for example if you iterate that one again and again and again you will also see bifurcations not only that but the ratio of when those bifurcations occur will have the same scaling for point six six nine any single hump function iterated will give you that fundamental constant so why is this well it's referred to as universality because there seems to be something fundamental and very Universal about this process this type of equation and that constant value in 1976 the biologist Robert May wrote a paper in nature about this very equation it's sparked a revolution and people looking into this stuff I mean that papers been cited thousands of times and in the paper he makes this plea that we should teach students about this simple equation because it gives you a new intuition for ways in which simple things simple equations can create very complex behaviors and I still think that today we don't really teach this way I mean we teach simple equations and simple outcomes because those are the easy things to do and those are the things that make sense we're not gonna throw chaos at students but maybe we should maybe we should throw at least a little bit which is why I've been so excited about chaos and I am so excited about this equation because you know how did I get to be 37 years old without hearing of the Feigenbaum constant ever since I read James Gleeks book chaos I have wanted to make videos on this topic and now I'm finally getting around to it and hopefully I'm doing this topic justice because I find it incredibly fascinating and I hope you do too</p>

分岔来得越来越快，但其比率趋近于这个固定值。没有人知道这个常数从何而来，它似乎与任何其他已知的物理常数无关，因此它本身就是自然界的一个基本常数。更疯狂的是，它不必是我之前展示的特定方程形式。任何具有**单峰函数**（single hump function: 只有一个局部最大值的函数）的方程，如果你以我们迭代的方式迭代它，例如你可以使用Xn+1等于sin(X)，如果你一遍又一遍地迭代它，你也会看到分岔。不仅如此，这些分岔发生时的比率也将具有相同的缩放比例4.669。任何迭代的单峰函数都会给你那个基本常数。

为什么会这样？这被称为**普适性**（universality: 在不同物理系统和数学模型中出现的相似行为和规律），因为这个过程、这种类型的方程以及那个常数值似乎具有某种基本且非常普适的特性。1976年，生物学家**罗伯特·梅**（Robert May）在《自然》（Nature）杂志上发表了一篇关于这个方程的论文。它引发了一场革命，人们开始研究这些东西。我的意思是，那篇论文已经被引用了数千次。在论文中，他恳请我们应该向学生教授这个简单的方程，因为它能让你对简单事物、简单方程如何创造非常复杂的行为产生新的直觉。

我仍然认为今天我们并没有真正以这种方式教学。我的意思是，我们教授简单的方程和简单的结果，因为那些是容易做到的事情，那些是合理的。我们不会向学生抛出混沌，但也许我们应该，也许我们至少应该抛出一点点，这就是为什么我对混沌如此兴奋，我对这个方程如此兴奋。因为你知道，我怎么会37岁了还没有听说过费根鲍姆常数呢？自从我读了**詹姆斯·格雷克**（James Gleick）的《混沌》（Chaos）一书以来，我就一直想制作关于这个主题的视频，现在我终于开始做了，希望我能公正地对待这个主题，因为我发现它非常引人入胜，也希望你如此。
