### 硅谷科技精英的政治转向

**主持人 (Jason Calacanis):** 好的，各位，欢迎回到 All-In 播客访谈系列。上周我们请来了乔·曼钦 (Joe Manchin)。这周，皮特·布蒂吉格 (Pete Buttigieg) 来到了这里。大家都知道皮特市长，他出生于南本德，毕业于哈佛，曾是罗德学者，在麦肯锡和美国海军服役，当然，他还竞选过总统，并在拜登政府担任交通部长。欢迎来到节目，皮特·布蒂吉格。你好吗？

<p class="english-text">All right, everybody. Welcome back to the All-In podcast interview series. Last week, we had Joe Mansion on. This week, Pete Buttigieg is here. Everybody knows Mayor Pete, born in Southbend, Harvard, Rhodes scholar, McKinsey, US Navy, and, of course, ran for president and was the transportation secretary under Biden. Welcome to the program, Pete Buttigieg. How are you?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 很好，谢谢你们邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Jason Calacanis):** 荣幸之至。这位是查马斯·帕里哈皮蒂亚 (Chamath Palihapitiya)，他曾是民主党人，后来撤回了对贵党的支持，现在成了一位共和党人。这个节目的精神就是进行坦诚的讨论。我们喜欢深入细节，所以我想从你对企业家、技术专家的看法开始。我看了你在比尔·马赫 (Bill Maher) 节目上的一段视频，你说：“嘿，你知道，硅谷这些自由意志主义、以科学为本的人们做出了一个非常实际的决定。这些富人决定支持共和党，而共和党往往会为富人做好事。” 这些富人包括蒂姆·库克 (Tim Cook)、马克·扎克伯格 (Mark Zuckerberg)、埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk)。这些人曾长期是民主党的一份子，是民主党的大额捐助者，但他们都发生了这种转变。你认为这仅仅是基于减少监管、获得更好的商业环境以赚取更多个人财富的实用主义考量，还是你认为在2024年的失利中有其他因素在起作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pleasure. Meet Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Democrat who rewrote his support of your party and now is a Republican and really the spirit of this program is to just have a candid discussion. We like to get into the details and so I thought I wanted to start with your perception of entrepreneurs, technologists, etc. I was watching a clip of you on Bill Maher and you said, "Hey, you know, these libertarian, science-based folks in Silicon Valley, they made a very practical decision. These are rich men who have decided to back the Republican party that tends to do good things for rich men." And these rich men include Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk. These are people who have been part of the Democratic party for a very long time. huge donors to the Democratic party and they all made this sort of flip. Do you think it was just pragmatically based upon the desire to have less regulations, a better business environment to personally make more money or do you think there were other things at work with the loss in 2024?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 嗯，我认为你不能把它归结为任何单一因素，但我当然认为这是故事的一部分。看，共和党的政策倾向于偏爱更富有的人，这已经不是什么秘密了。很多疏远民主党的人，至少是那些备受关注的人，比如这些商界人物、投资者、亿万富翁怎么会离开民主党转投共和党，这可能是一个“狗咬人”式的寻常故事，不是什么特别复杂的事情。如果你看看事实，民主党人一直极度关注财富和收入不平等，而你面对的是一群非常非常富有的人。我不认为仅仅是这个原因。我的意思是，我认为有很多因素同时起了作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't think you can reduce it to any one thing, but I certainly think that's part of the story. Look, it's no secret that Republican policies tend to favor people who are wealthier. And a lot of people who drifted away from the Democratic party, at least the ones who are getting a lot of attention. Like how could these business figures, investors, billionaires have gotten away from Democrats and gone to Republicans might be kind of a you know dog bites man story. like not something that's wildly complicated. If you look at the fact that, you know, Democrats have been extremely concerned about wealth and income inequality and you got a lot of very very wealthy people. I don't think it was just that. I mean, I think there are a lot of things that that kind of combined at once.</p>
</details>

但是，你知道，我的很多朋友都在挠头说：“等一下，这些人来自科技和科学界。他们怎么能支持一个一直在删除科学文献引用、并在气候问题上审查科学的总统或政府呢？” 他们中的许多人是自由意志主义者。他们怎么能支持一个向街头派遣军队、并严厉打压自由的政府呢？这简直就像是我保守派和自由意志主义朋友们在喝啤酒争论政治时的噩梦，我从没想过会看到这种事发生。这些人中，有些是同性恋，他们怎么能支持一个确实攻击了 LGBT 权利的政府呢？如果你逐项看下去，会发现很多关于这些硅谷领袖转变立场的事情是违反直觉的，很多情况下他们是从非常活跃的民主党人转变为支持特朗普。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, for a lot of my friends who are scratching their heads saying, "Wait a minute, these are folks who are from the tech and science world. How could they back a president or administration that's been deleting references to science and kind of censoring science at least anytime that climate is concerned?" A lot of these guys are libertarian. How could they be on board with the administration that is sending troops into streets and has really led a crackdown on freedom. That's kind of something out of the fever dreams of my conservative and libertarian friends back when we were, you know, arguing about politics over beers that I never thought I would see happen. These folks, some of these folks are gay and how can they be backing an administration that's, you know, really assaulted LGBT rights? And you know, if you just go down the list, there's a lot of things that are counterintuitive about some of these Silicon Valley leaders who flipped in many cases flipped from being very very active Democrats to backing Trump.</p>
</details>

你知道，对于这个反直觉的现象，也许有一个直觉性的答案，那就是他们中的许多人觉得，共和党更能服务于他们的短期商业利益或个人财务利益。我理解这一点。但我会反驳，就像我认为硅谷里许多仍然是民主党人的人会反驳的那样：看，一个健康的商业环境，你固然不希望被过度监管，但你也希望身处一个有法治的环境中。你希望在一个可以大声说出科学真理的地方。你希望在一个没有人能将他们对宗教的解释强加于他人之上的地方。我对此有一整套反驳的论点。但是，你知道，我认为这就是我们在2020年到2024年这短短几年里陷入的漩涡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, maybe there's an intuitive answer to that counterintuitive thing, which is that many of them feel their short-term business interests or personal financial interests are better served by Republicans. I get that. I would counter, as I think a lot of people in Silicon Valley who are still Democrats would, that look, a healthy business environment, you know, you don't want to be overregulated, but you also want to make sure you're an environment with rule of law. You want to be in a place where it's safe to say scientific truths out loud. you want to be in a place where somebody can't impose their interpretation of their religion on other people. I, you know, I have a whole counter to that. But, you know, I think that's the kind of swirl that we got into. Definitely just in those short years between 2020 and 24.</p>
</details>

### 审查制度与虚假对等

**主持人:** 你认为拜登政府对科学真理之类的东西存在审查吗？让我们暂时聚焦于新冠疫情，以及拜登政府似乎与 Facebook 和 Twitter 等平台有后门联系，以压制你刚才提到的科学思想和辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think that there was censorship under the Biden administration for things like scientific truth? Let's just focus on COVID for a second and the back doors that it seemed that the Biden administration had to places like Facebook and places like Twitter to just suppress scientific thought and debate as you just talked about.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 所以，这是我见过的关于虚假对等的一个惊人例子。是的，我承认，我想很多人会说，在政府试图确保不良信息或错误信息不被推入公共卫生对话中，并与那些试图负责任、做正确事情的社交媒体公司接触时，有些时候确实离红线很近。可能有些时候他们做错了或做得过火了。但现在，我们所处的时刻是，美国总统不喜欢被一个喜剧演员批评，就让负责监管那些试图收购电视网络的公司的**FCC**（Federal Communications Commission: 美国联邦通信委员会）负责人去威胁他们，说“你们可以选容易的方式，也可以选难的方式”。我的意思是，那是完全不同层次的审查。更不用说他们对每个政府网站的做法，删除了任何可能意外提及气候变化的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is an amazing example of some of the false equivalencies that I've seen thrown around out there. So yeah, I would acknowledge I think a lot of folks would say that you know it came really close to the stove some of the times when the administration was trying to make sure that you know bad information or misinformation wasn't being pushed into the kind of public health conversation and was engaging social media companies that were trying to you know be responsible and do the right thing and and there might be moments that that you know they got that wrong or went too far. But right now, we're in a moment, right, where the president of the United States doesn't like being criticized by a comedian and has the head of the FCC, which regulates corporations that are trying to buy TV networks, go out and threaten them and say, you know, you're we can do this the easy way or the hard way. I mean, that is a whole different level of censorship. Not to mention just the way they've gone through like every government website, right, and deleted anything that could accidentally be a reference to climate change.</p>
</details>

所以，我担心这里的虚假对等。你当然可以说，在上届政府或任何一届政府中，都有一些时刻我们可以争论，为了忠于言论自由，你应该这样做而不是那样做，或者这些边缘案例应该有所不同。但我很担心，任何人会把一个总统试图指挥摧毁他不仅不喜欢的记者，还有喜剧演员的行为，与公共卫生部门在一场导致一百万美国人死亡的公共卫生紧急事件中，尽最大努力确保人们获得良好公共卫生信息的行为等同起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, I'm worried about the false equivalencies here. You could definitely say there were moments under the last administration or any administration where we could argue that that having fidelity to to free speech, you know, you should have done this way instead of that way or these edge cases should have been different. But but I am nervous that anybody would equate a president trying to direct the destruction not only of journalists but of comedians that he doesn't like with public health authorities in a public health emergency that killed a million Americans doing their best to try to make sure that people got good public health information.</p>
</details>

### 财富税与税收政策的争议

**主持人:** 让我们谈谈一些实际问题，也就是税收政策。我认为，我们看到的这种反复，以及民主党为何失去了所有这些杰出的企业家和资本家——他们建立了这些创造了我们国家所有就业和税基的伟大公司——的一个原因，是最近的两项税收提案。纽约市的 Mandami，我不知道你是否已公开支持他，但他提议对最高收入者征收54%的税。在加州，我们有人提出法案，要对亿万富翁征收5%的财富税。在最近一次 Mandami 的集会上，人们高喊“向富人征税”。而我认为比你更左的伊丽莎白·沃伦 (Elizabeth Warren) 和伯尼·桑德斯 (Bernie Sanders)——如果我错了你可以纠正我——他们在说：“嘿，禁止亿万富翁。” 我们出现了这样一种运动，认为成为亿万富翁在某种程度上是不道德或不合伦理的。所以，让我们从一些基本问题开始。你会支持财富税吗？显然你会在2028年再次竞选总统，而且你是主要候选人之一。你会支持财富税吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk a little bit about where the rubber meets the road, which is tax policy. And I think a lot of what we've seen in this back and forth to add to why the Democrats lost all of these amazing entrepreneurs and capitalists who build these amazing companies that create all the jobs in the tax base for this country. Two tax proposals recently, New York City with Mandami and I don't know if you've come out and publicly supported him yet, but he's proposing 54% tax for the top earners there. Here in California, we have the floating of a bill to charge a wealth tax of 5% on billionaires. At a recent Mandami rally, they were chanting tax the rich. And Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, who I think are far left of you, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, are saying, "Hey, ban the billionaires." And we have this sort of movement that being a billionaire is in some way immoral or unethical. So, let's start with some brass tax here. Would you support, and obviously you're going to run for president again in 2028, and you're one of the lead candidates. Would you ever support a wealth tax?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 原则上，也许会。是的。我的意思是，你说的很对，像伯尼这样的人确实比我更左。我不了解你刚才提到的州和地方提案的细节，但从表面上看，它们似乎比我愿意接受的程度要远。但是，看，实际上，我们对各种各样的事物征税，对吧？有所得税，有工资税，有财产税。财富税有点类似于财产税。当然，其想法是，你有很多变得极其富有的人。重要的是，按照现在的税收方式，最富有的人积累财富的方式越来越少被记为收入，对吧？这就是为什么你会听到那些拥有数十亿美元的公司或个人，其实际税率竟然低于教师或消防员的故事。我想大多数人都明白这是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In principle, maybe. Yeah. I mean, you rightly said, you know, folks like Bernie are to my left. I don't know the details of the state and local proposals you just mentioned, but those sound on their face like they're further than I would go. But look, in reality, we tax across a variety of things, right? There's income tax, there's payroll tax, there's property tax. Wealth tax would be kind of along the lines of a property tax. And the thought, of course, is that you've got a lot of folks who become incredibly wealthy. And importantly, the way taxation works now, less and less of the way the wealthiest people accumulate their income is actually booked as income, right? And this is why you have these stories of, you know, multi-billion dollar corporations or multi-billion dollar individuals somehow paying an effective tax rate that's lower than a teacher or a firefighter. And I think most people get that that's wrong.</p>
</details>

所以我想我的总体看法是，你知道，任何事情都需要平衡，任何事情都有极限，但如果你问我，现在美国最富有的人是缴税太多还是太少？我会说最富有的人缴税太少了。无论你是通过所得税来调整，还是通过像财富税这样的方式来调整，有很多方法可以做到。我认为重要的是要公平，要有道理，并且要以一种能够确保那些从我们的体系中获得巨大回报的人为其做出贡献的方式来进行，同时又不能极端到扼杀财富创造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I guess my overall take is, you know, everything has a balance, everything has limits, but if if you're asking me the question, are the wealthiest people in America right now paying too much tax or too little tax? I would say the wealthiest are paying too little tax. and whether you adjust that through income tax, whether you adjust that through, you know, something like a wealth tax. And there's a lot of ways to do it. I think what's important is that it's fair, that it makes sense, and and that you do it in a way that that can make sure that the people who are spectacularly rewarded by our system are contributing to it without being so extreme that that you know, you're you're you're crushing wealth creation.</p>
</details>

### 政府开支的效率与问责

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 在你看来，美国政府对其收到的税款有什么责任？我们如何判断钱是否被恰当、有效地使用，而不是用于个人偏好的项目、政治分肥，或者干脆就是浪费和贪腐？界限在哪里？请给我们一些例子，说明你将如何确保随着税收的增加，问责制也随之加强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the responsibility of the US government in your eyes with the tax receipts that they get? How do we understand that money is being spent appropriately and well versus pet projects or pork barrel spending or frankly just waste and grift. Where is that line? And give us some examples of how you would make sure that as tax receipts went up, accountability went up with it.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 是的，我认为这非常重要，人们缴纳税款的意愿在某种程度上取决于他们是否觉得物有所值。我是在担任市长时开始积累经验的。我们不能随心所欲地印更多的钱。作为南本德市，我们实行现金预算，每年都必须平衡。如果我们举债，我们必须认真考虑如何偿还。我们确保每当我们要求人们向城市缴纳税款时，他们都清楚自己能得到什么回报，无论是警察服务、公园还是垃圾清运。我认为用这个比喻来思考国家层面的运作方式也不算太糟，对吧？我们应该相信我们能得到好的服务，好的基础设施。这显然是我在联邦层面担任交通部长时的工作内容。我们应该得到好的国防以及我们作为一个国家所做的所有其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's that's super important and and people's willingness to pay taxes depends on some level on their, you know, sense that they're getting good value for their money. So, I I cut my teeth as a mayor. We didn't we couldn't, you know, print more dollars if we wanted to. As the city of South Bend, we had a cash budget, had to balance it every year. If we took on debt, we really had to think hard about how we were going to pay on that debt. We made sure that any time we're asking people to be paying revenue into the city, they know what they're getting for that. Whether it's police service or parks or trash pickup, I don't think that's the worst metaphor to think about how things should work at the national level, too, right? We we should believe that we're getting good services, good infrastructure. That was obviously what what I worked on when I was at the federal level as as Secretary of Transportation. We should get good national defense and all the other things that we, you know, as a country are</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你如何确保钱不被浪费？我给你举个例子。你从《基础设施与就业法案》中获得了数十亿美元用于部署充电基础设施，对吧？但截至今年，只有几百个这样的充电站。这基本上算是一次彻底的失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you how do you make sure that it's not wasted? Like I'll give you an example. You had billions and billions of dollars allocated to you from the infrastructure and jobs act to deploy charging infrastructure, right? And as of this year, there's only a few hundred of these charging stations. It's been pretty much an abject failure.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 嗯，那不是真的。我很高兴你提出这个问题，因为它实际上是我们必须处理的最大的障眼法之一。这是一个旨在到2030年部署电动汽车充电桩的项目。当时的想法是，到2030年，我们认为大约一半的汽车销售将是电动汽车。为了让这顺利进行，我们需要更多的充电桩。市场在很多地方能很好地提供充电桩，但在其他一些地方，我们发现由于收入较低或地处偏远、人口分散，私营部门来做这件事在经济上划不来，对吧？所以，我们有一个名为**NEVI**（National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure: 国家电动汽车基础设施）的基金，我甚至不记得这个缩写代表什么了，但重点是，就像你说的，大约有70亿美元，用于弥补差价，补贴或直接在需要的地方建造这些充电桩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh that's not true. And and I'm really glad you raised that because it's actually one of the biggest red herrings we had to deal with. So this is a program to get EV chargers deployed by 2030. The thought was, you know, by 2030, we think about half of the sales or we were hoping about half the sales of cars in the country would be EVs. Now, in order to have that work well, we're going to need more chargers. The market does a good job of delivering chargers in a lot of places, but there were other places where we found it was lower income or it was more rural. It was more spread out and it just wasn't going to pencil for the private sector to do to do it, right? So, we had a fund called NEVI. I can't even remember what the acronym was, but the point was it was like you said about $7 billion to buy down the difference to subsidize or just outright build those chargers in places where they were needed.</p>
</details>

我们做出了几个选择，我们知道这些选择会意味着项目耗时更长，但我们对此可以接受。其中之一是由各州主导。因此，我们不是坐在华盛顿决定所有充电桩应该建在哪里，而是将资金拨给各州，让他们建立自己的项目。重要的是，我们允许他们以不同的方式建立自己的项目。所以，我们不会去规定怀俄明州与西弗吉尼亚州相比，最佳补贴是多少，或者你甚至是通过补贴来做，还是由州政府拥有和运营。我们在这一点上退了一步，让各州去创新，即使这意味着他们需要一段时间来完善项目，因为我们知道大多数充电桩将在2026年、2027年安装，但远在2030年之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we made a couple of choices that we knew would mean that it would take longer, but we were okay with that. One of them was to have it led by the states. So instead of sitting there in Washington saying where all the chargers ought to be built, we send the funding to the states. We let them set up their own program. And importantly, we let them set up their own programs differently. So, you know, we were going to dictate what the optimal subsidy was in Wyoming compared to West Virginia or whether you even do it through a subsidy or whether it's owned and operated by the state. We took we took a step back on that, let the states innovate, even if that means it's going to take a while for them to polish the program, knowing that that meant most of the chargers would go in in 2026, 2027, but well ahead of 2030.</p>
</details>

第二点，这也非常重要。我们做出了一个有意识的决定，坚持充电桩必须在美国制造。当你这样做时，你就是在决定项目会耗时更长。我承认这一点，因为直接从中国购买现成的产品会快得多。我们认为这是值得的，因为我们认为拥有一个以美国为基础的产业很重要，由美国工人，最好是工会的电工来制造和安装这些充电桩。同样，我们知道，如果目标是在2023年或2024年之前全部完成，我们就没有这样做的余地了。但由于我们认为大部分充电桩的需求要到2030年才会出现，我们对此可以接受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the second thing, this is really important, too. We made a conscious decision to insist that the Chargers be made in America. Now, when you do that, you're deciding that it's going to take longer. I'll just admit that because just buy them off the shelf from China would be dramatically quicker. We thought that was worth it because we thought it was important to have a US-based industry with, you know, American workers, ideally union electrical workers, making and installing these chargers. Again, we knew that if if the goal was to get them all done by like 2023 or 2024, we wouldn't have had the luxury of doing that. But since we thought most of the charges would be needed by well, by 2030, we were okay with that.</p>
</details>

现在，华盛顿的政治游戏来了，对吧？有人拿到了数据，看到这是一个七八十亿美元的项目，然后错误地试图让它看起来像是我们已经把这七八十亿美元花在了他们已经设法先建好的少数几个充电桩上，尽管我们从未想过大部分充电桩会在我们的第一个任期内建成。这就是华盛顿游戏的玩法，对吧？拿一件事情——我的意思是，结果还未定，对吧？项目还没完成。我们将看看特朗普政府在完成这个项目方面做得如何。但是，你知道，在项目运行完成之前，你不能真正说它是成功还是失败。但他们移动了球门。我不是在挑战你，说政府开支中没有浪费，没有发生我不喜欢的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here comes Washington politics, right? And somebody gets a hold of the numbers. They see it's a seven or eight billion dollar program and then falsely try to make it look like we spent the seven or eight billion dollars already on the handful of chargers that that they already managed to build first even though we never thought most of the charges would be built even during our first term. And that's where the Washington game comes in, right? Take something that I mean the jury is still out, right? The program's not done. We'll see how the Trump administration does in completing the program. But, you know, you can't really say whether it was a success or a failure until the program's been run. But they move the goalpost. And I'm not challenging you that like there's waste that there's bad things that happen in and and and government spending that I don't like. But</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 总的来说，你最好的猜测是什么？美国纳税人交给美国政府的每一美元，有多少真正用于惠及美国人的生产性项目，又有多少被漏掉了？你最好的猜测是什么？是每美元50美分，10美分，一分钱，还是90美分？你最好的猜测是什么？你曾深入这些组织的内部。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's your what's your best guess in general? For every dollar that gets given to the United States government by US taxpayers, what actually lands in productive programs that benefit Americans versus what gets leaked away? What's your best guess? Is it 50 cents of every dollar, 10 cents of every dollar, a penny, 90 cents? Like what is your best guess? you've been in the bowels of these organizations.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 我在交通领域的经验是，大部分资金都用在了非常有益的地方。如果你把它分解一下，它用于维持航空部门安全运营，用于高速公路、道路和桥梁等。这是我们在基础设施一揽子计划中最大的一笔资金。当政府问责办公室或监察长——顺便说一句，这些都是特朗普现在正在摧毁的机构——这些进行审计并以两党合作方式深入调查的组织，在涉及直接欺诈方面，他们得出的数字通常远低于1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So my experience in transportation is that most of it goes to very good use. I mean if you just break it down it goes to things that keep the aviation sector operating safely. It goes to things like highways, roads and bridges. That was the biggest slug of funding that we had in the infrastructure package. and when you know the general or the government accountability office or or the inspector general by the way institutions that Trump is demolishing right now but the organizations that do the auditing and really dig in on a bipartisan basis um often in terms of outright fraud you know they're going to come in a number that's well below 1%.</p>
</details>

但我也看到过，我自己的感觉是……我想到了我在军队的时光。你知道，有一栋建筑，我想是在莱瑟内克，也许是坎大哈，但我想是莱瑟内克。我到那里时，有一栋建筑已经建了好几年，我想花了大概3000万美元。就在他们准备启用它之前，他们又把它拆了。我的意思是，这完全是个劳民伤财的工程。我们确实看到过类似的事情发生。我们看到很多项目的成本不断攀升。所以，这和欺诈不一样。欺诈可能不到1%，但这仍然是巨大的浪费，如果一个项目的成本比应有的高出1%、10%甚至有时是100%，对吧？我的意思是，根据定义，建造某物所花费的每一分钱，只要超过了实际所需，就是浪费。我确实认为这种情况很多。我认为政府的程序常常自缚手脚。

<details>

<p class="english-text">but but but you know I've also seen my own sense as effective... no effectively this is this comes to the other part I was going to say I mean I think about my time in the military for example. you know there was a building. I think it was Leatherneck. Maybe it was Kandahar, but I think it was Leatherneck. When I traveled out there, there was a building that had taken years to go up. I think it was like $30 million. And just before they were about to activate it, they tore it back down. I mean, it's just a complete boondoggle. And and we see stuff like that happening for sure. We see cost escalations on a lot of projects. So, it's not, you know, it's not the same as fraud. I mean that's the like under 1% but it's still a huge waste if you have a project cost 1% or 10% or sometimes 100% more than it should right I mean by definition every penny it takes to build something more than what it was actually required is wasted and I do think there's a lot of that I think government gets in its own way with procedure</p>

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 作为部长，请向我们解释一下，你在阻止这种浪费方面有多大的控制权？如果你看到了，比如我给你一个具体的例子。2023年，**FAA**（Federal Aviation Administration: 美国联邦航空管理局）出现了一些相当惊人的系统中断。我们现在都知道我们的航空安全基础设施极其脆弱，需要升级。你在23年看到了一直在发生中断。你做了什么来阻止这种情况？当你看到浪费时，你如何阻止它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just explain to us as a secretary how much control do you have in stopping that waste So if you see it, so I'll give you a specific example. In 2023, there was some pretty incredible outages in the FAA. We've all now learned that we have an incredibly brittle air safety infrastructure that needs to be upgraded. You saw that in 23 there was outages all the time. What do you do to stop that? And when you see the waste, how do you stop it?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 你知道，那是一个我们需要投资的例子，对吧？所以，这是一个艰难的处境，需要硬着头皮去国会和纳税人面前说：“看，我们需要更多的资金来做这件事。” 但我们就是这么做的。顺便说一句，这是我为数不多地同意我的继任者的地方之一，他也做了几乎同样的事情，以确保我们获得升级技术所需的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, that was an example where we needed to invest, right? So, it's that tough situation and needing to swallow hard and go before Congress and the taxpayer and say, "Look, we need more funding for this." But that's what we did. And by the way, this is one of the rare areas where I agree with my successor who's done pretty much the same thing to make sure we got the funding to upgrade the technology.</p>
</details>

这是少数几个可能足够专业的听众群体之一，我可以稍微 geek out 一下，谈谈我们正在进行的通信骨干网的大升级。我们正在从 **TDM** (Time-Division Multiplexing: 时分复用) 转向 **IP** (Internet Protocol: 互联网协议)，从铜缆转向光纤。我想很多人会惊讶地发现，像我们航空系统这样重要且理论上现代化的东西，竟然还在使用 TDM。所以，这显然需要升级。我们启动了一份合同，Verizon 是承包商。你知道，当一个 IT 合同需要达到不是五个九（99.999%），而是像十亿分之一的出错几率，并且要全年无休、全天候运行时，这显然是一个多年、数十亿美元的合同。这很有挑战性，需要时间。但你知道，这就是我们对那个特定问题感到非常紧迫的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this is one of the few audiences might be nerdy enough that that I can geek out a little bit and talk about the big upgrade to the communications backbone that that we were doing. It was to go from TDM to IP from from copper to fiber and to I think a lot of people would be astonished to know that you know something as important and theoretically modern as our aviation system is working on TDM. So that obviously had to be upgraded. We launched a contract. Verizon is the contractor. You know, obviously a multi-year multi-billion dollar IT contract when you have to have, you know, not even 59s but like billion to one chance of anything going wrong 24 by7 by 365. You know, it's challenging and it takes a while. But, you know, that's one of the reasons why we felt a lot of urgency on that particular issue.</p>
</details>

但同样，看待这个问题有两种方式，对吧？两者都是真实的。一种是审视这个系统，然后说，这个系统怎么能不更现代化呢？我们需要更好地利用投入到系统中的资金，以拥有更先进的通信基础设施，拥有更多装备精良、休息充分的管制员，FAA 在这方面必须做得更好。另一种看待方式是，思考这个国家航空安全的文明成就。所以，抱怨很容易，我也会抱怨，而且不止是抱怨。作为一名乘客，我对航空业的运作方式有很多不满，这就是为什么我们对航空公司在乘客保护方面施加了如此大的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, there's two ways of looking at this, right? Both of which are true. One thing is to look at the system and say how can the system not be more modern like we need to make better use of the dollars that go into the system to have more up-to-date communications infrastructure to have more controllers who are both well equipped and well-rested and FA's got to do better on that. The other way to look at it is consider the civilizational achievement that is aviation safety in this country. So it's easy to grumble and I grumble and more than grumble. I mean, I got pretty upset with a lot of things about how aviation works as a passenger, which is why we pushed airlines so hard on on passenger protections.</p>
</details>

但是，你知道，仅在我担任部长的四年里，我们大约有40亿人次的乘客登机。也就是说，有40亿次有人登上飞机，对吧？而在这40亿次中，商业航空公司的坠机死亡人数为零。换句话说，这个有点笨拙、不完美的联邦政府所取得的成就，是在一种涉及以接近音速的速度、由易燃液体推动、在离地数英里的高空飞行的交通方式上，达到了一个安全标准。坦率地说，你和我，我们中的一个，不是开玩笑，更有可能在这次录制期间因自然原因随机死亡，而不是卷入商业航空公司的致命事故。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, just in the four years I was secretary, we had about 4 billion passenger implants. So, 4 billion times somebody got on an airplane, right? Um, and zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of that 4 billion. In other words, what this kind of clunky, imperfect federal government has achieved is a standard of safety on afford a form of transportation that involves being propelled through the air almost at the speed of sound by flammable liquids miles above the ground. And you know, frankly, you and I are one of us is more likely, not to be flip about it, but one of us is more likely to randomly die of natural causes during this taping than to be involved in a commercial airline fatality.</p>

### 政府与市场的角色分工

**主持人:** 我在想，现在你已经40多岁了，见识了很多世面，无论是你的兵役经历，还是作为一个小镇的市长，再到后来在内阁任职。你对自由市场动态解决问题与政府解决问题的看法，是否有所演变？因为当我们谈论这些问题时，你看看太空领域正在发生什么。多亏了埃隆·马斯克和 SpaceX，我们现在进入太空的成本只有过去的5%。多亏了特斯拉和其他一些公司，比如 ChargePoint 等，我们现在到处都有超级充电站和充电桩。当谈到将光纤铺设到农村地区时，**FTC**（Federal Trade Commission: 美国联邦贸易委员会）曾试图这样做，他们计划每户花费5000到25000美元。而现在我们有了 Starlink 和它的竞争对手。又回到了埃隆，而你的政党在拜登领导下，甚至决定不邀请他参加电动汽车峰会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I was about to say, I mean, it is like in some places in our some places in our infrastructure, we're incredibly blessed. And I'm wondering as, you know, now you're in your 40s, you've seen a lot of the world, whether it's your military service or or, you know, just being a mayor of a small town and then, uh, obviously working in a cabinet position. How has your view of free market dynamic solving problems versus the government solving problems evolved if at all? Because when we talk about these problems, you look at what's happening with space. We now can get to space for, you know, 5% of the cost than we used to. Thanks to Elon Musk and SpaceX, we have superchargers and chargers everywhere thanks to Tesla and a number of other folks putting them out there, Charge Point, etc. when it comes to putting fiber into rural areas, which the FTC was trying to do, they were going to spend5 to $25,000 per home. And now we have Starlink and their competitors. Again, back to Elon, which your party decided under Biden, you wouldn't even invite the guy to the EV summit. So,</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 嗯，让我谈谈这个，但我想先把这个放一边，因为我们或许应该谈谈那里发生了什么。但让我们先忘了那个，因为我想提一下……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well, let me talk about that, but we'll I want to park that to the side because we should probably talk about what happened there. But let's forget that cuz I want to I want to mention that</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 因为当你知道，我是一个温和派，但大约65%的时间投票给民主党，三分之一的时间投票给共和党。当我看到这些时，我就是无法理解民主党为什么这么恨我们。恨企业家，这就是他们的感觉。这就是硅谷的感觉。我们会讨论你是否想否认这一点。但感觉就像……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because when you when you know I I'm a I'm a moderate but voted Democrat about 65% of the time and Republican a third of the time. When I look at it, I just can't understand how the Democratic party hates us so much. Hates entrepreneurs and that's how they feel. But that's how that's how Silicon Valley feels. We'll talk about whether you want to deny it or not. But it feels like</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 恨企业家？我不认为大多数民主党人是这样。但我明白你说的“氛围”是什么意思，我们应该谈谈关于埃隆的那部分。但关于你提出的问题的实质部分。是的，我认为把这个问题看作是“应该是政府还是私营部门”而不是“政府应该做哪些部分，私营部门应该做哪些部分”非常重要。对我来说，典型的例子就是智能手机，对吧。我无法想象由联邦政府设计的智能手机会是多么漂亮的东西，或者由政府设计的应用程序……事实上，我在军队里处理过一些，我猜你可以称之为“应用程序”的软件，即使是承包商做的，它的设计方式也能让你看出来是政府主导的，而且不怎么好看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hate entre like I don't think most Democrats do. I I but I I know what you mean about the vibes and we should get to the piece about about Elon particularly but but but on the piece you're on the substance of the question you're raising. Yeah. I think it's really important to think of this as not like should it be government or should it be the private sector but like which parts should government do and which parts should the private sector do. So to me like the classic example is just the smartphone right. Um, I cannot imagine that a smartphone designed by the federal government would be a pretty thing or that an app designed by a matter of fact having been in the military and and dealt with I guess you could call them apps like some of the kind of uh software that that that you have to deal with even if it's done by contractors. It's kind of done in a way that you can tell was designed by the government and and and it's not pretty.</p>
</details>

另一方面，当你谈到资本配置时，联邦政府实际上发明了互联网，对吧？所以，有些价值万亿美元的想法，私营部门就是不会去做，因为经济上不划算，或者因为存在某种市场失灵。这时候就需要政府。比如基础研究，比如填补空白，尤其是在网络效应方面，比如宽带、电动汽车充电网络之类的事情，其中大部分可以由私营部门做得很好，但有些部分就是无法衔接，除非有联邦政府的参与。这就是我们对电动汽车等问题采取的态度。我从未想过我们要创造一个政府版的电动汽车，或者说甚至需要政府来确保向电动的转型发生。但我们确实相信，为了让它在美国制造，为了让它像我们希望的那样迅速发生，为了让它惠及那些可能负担不起初始购买成本、我们真正想帮助的人们，政策和资金就能发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, on the other hand, you know, when you talk about capital allocation, the federal government literally invented the internet, right? So, there's things there's certain trillion dollar ideas that the private sector just won't do cuz it doesn't pencil or because of whatever market failure is there. That's where you need government. That's things like basic research. That's things like filling in gaps that especially on network effects like you know broadband, EV charging networks, that sort of thing where the bulk of it can be done quite well by the private sector, but there are pieces that just don't click unless you have unless you have federal involvement. And that's the attitude we tried to take on things like EVs. Like I never thought that we were going to, you know, create a government EV or that you even needed the government to make sure that a transition to electric happened. But we did believe that for it to be made in America, for it to happen as quickly as we wanted, and for it to reach people who maybe couldn't afford those those initial buyin costs who we really wanted to help out, you know, that's where there's a role for policy. That's where there's a role for funding.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 但让我困惑的是，皮特，一方面你说政府应该设立这些清晰的、能推动美国前进的“登月计划”目标。但另一方面，如果你在实现这些目标方面做得太好，我们又想来拿走你的一大块成果。你如何调和这一点？你认为这对那些想要学习、追求卓越、敢于冒险，同时也希望相信如果他们冒险并获得回报，那是他们应得的年轻男女的动机有何影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I get confused though, Pete, is like on the one hand, you're saying the government should set up these clear moonshot objectives that advance America for itself and relative to other countries. But then the other side is that if you do too well achieving those objectives, we want to go and take a bunch of that away from you. How do you reconcile that? And how do you think it impacts the the motivations of young men and women who want to learn and excel and put themselves at risk but also want to believe that if they put themselves at risk and then they are rewarded that they've earned those rewards.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 看，我喜欢人们有创业精神，创造一些东西并因此获得成功。但这是有一定限度的。如果你通过创业创造了垄断，是的，我可能不喜欢。如果你伤害了别人，我可能不喜欢。如果你将权力极端地集中在自己手中，我可能不喜欢，因为那不符合美国精神。但总的来说，如果我们谈论的是税收，我只是想确保那些非常富有的人尽自己的一份力，为这个帮助他们茁壮成长的系统做出贡献。因为这才是下一代能做得好的前提，也是我们所有人能做得好的前提。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I love people being entrepreneurial, creating something and doing well by it. I mean that's but to a certain basic idea only to a certain level like beyond a certain point of entrepreneurship if you create a monopoly. Yeah. If you create a monopoly I might not like it. If you hurt other people I might not like it. If you concentrate power into your hands to an extreme extent I might not like it because that's just that's just not American. But in general if we're talking about taxation I just want to make sure people who are really well off do their part to pay into a system that has helped them to thrive. because you know that's what it takes for the next generation to do well and that's what it took for all of us to do well. I mean</p>

### 美国国债的不可持续之路

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 也许我们可以谈谈债务问题？我想这或许可以作为一个过渡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we go to debt maybe um as part of this? I don't know where you were going to go chas but I think maybe</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Jason Calacanis):** 是的，那是个很好的过渡。我只想指出，在过去的九年里，在特朗普、拜登以及现在的特朗普任期内，我们的债务增加了大约2万亿美元。我们刚刚达到了38万亿。所以看起来我们每年都在增加2万亿。你对这种状况的可持续性有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah and then that's a good segue. I was just going to point out, you know, we've we've added about $2 trillion in debt over the last uh well, nine years now under Trump, one 45 46 Biden and now again with Trump, we just hit 38 trillion. So, it seems like we're adding 2 trillion a year. What's your take on the sustainability of this?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 首先，我们目前的债务路径是不可持续的。在这一点上，你说得对，两党都没有光彩的表现。这也是我与我党内一些人意见相左的地方。我认为很长一段时间以来，你从民主党人那里听到的信息基本上是债务无关紧要，或者根本不存在这回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, the the debt path we're on is not sustainable. And that's one area where you're right, neither party has covered themselves in glory. And it's an area where I would part with some in my own party. I think for too long you've heard the message from Democrats is basically debt doesn't matter like or there's no such thing.</p>
</details>

曾经有一段时间，这种说法感觉更可信一些。几年前的一些证据为所谓的**现代货币理论**（Modern Monetary Theory: 一种认为主权国家可以通过印钞为其支出提供资金的经济学理论）提供了很多支持。我认为现在很多情况看起来不一样了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there was a moment when this felt a little more credible. Some of the evidence at as of a few years ago put a lot of wind in the sales of what was called modern monetary theory. I think a lot of that looks different now.</p>
</details>

然后是共和党人，对吧，他们说债务很重要，但行动上却完全相反。看，作为一个好的民主党人，我可以指出，我认为在投资回报方面存在差异，历史经验已经向我们证明了这一点。当你为了修建道路、桥梁和其他生产性基础设施而增加债务时，所获得的回报，与你为了给国家最富有的人提供大规模减税而引爆债务相比，是不同的。因为后者从未产生过预期的增长。我的意思是，**拉弗曲线**（Laffer Curve: 描述税率与税收收入之间关系的曲线，认为税率过高会抑制经济活动从而减少税收）在经验上已经崩溃了，事实并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It looks different. And then you had the And then you had the Republicans, right, who say that debt matters but then act the exact opposite. Now, look, as as a good Democrat, I could point out that I would argue there's a difference in terms of what history empirically has shown us in terms of the return on investment you get when you raise debt to fix roads and bridges and other productive infrastructure versus if you blow up the debt in order to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country. because that has just never generated the growth that you know I mean the laugher curve has collapsed empirically and it just doesn't work that way right</p>
</details>

所以我可以争论，如果你要举债，最好的用途是什么。我认为最好的用途是教育、医疗保健，投资于确保孩子们不被铅中毒，投资于港口和道路，而不是投资于为那些极度富有、并不需要减税的人减税。在某些情况下，他们甚至没有要求减税，而且在历史上，当他们在美国缴纳更多税款时，他们的生产力实际上更高。但撇开党派之争，我确实想回来再次同意你的观点，即我们现在的处境是不可持续的。与一些左派人士的说法相反，债务是真实存在的，它确实很重要，我们需要确保我们未来的做法更符合一些基本的财政责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I could quibble over if you're going to do debt what's the best thing to do with it and I would argue the best thing to do with it is education healthcare investing it make sure kids don't get lead poisoned investing it in ports and roads and not investing it in tax cuts for extremely wealthy people who who didn't need them and in some cases weren't really asking for it and were perfectly productive in fact history would say more productive at times in history when they were paying more taxes in the US. But leaving that partisan fight aside, I do want to come back and agree with you again that that where we are right now is not sustainable. That contrary to what some on the left would say, there is such a thing as the debt. It does matter and we need to make sure that what we're doing going forward is more consistent with with some basic fiscal responsibility.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Jason Calacanis):** 什么是财政责任？我的意思是，我一遍又一遍地从你们这些政治家那里听到这些政治辞令，但我从未听到任何人说：“听着，我们得勒紧裤腰带了。我们将不得不削减失业救济金。我们必须削减这些……我们必须在这里增税。我们必须在那里削减开支。” 我从未听过你们中的任何一个人提出一个能通过我们商界人士审查的计划，我们必须经营公司并确保它们有偿付能力。这看起来你们并没有计划，其他人也没有。是不是因为这太不受欢迎了，以至于你不能直接说：“嘿，这里将会有一些紧缩政策，这会很痛苦，还会有更多的税收，那也会很痛苦，然后你就选不上了。” 是这个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the fiscal responsibility? I mean, I hear all these, you know, political speak over and over again from you guys, but I never hear anybody say, "You know what? We got to tighten our belts, folks. We're going to have to cut unemployment. We have to cut these and we're going to have to raise taxes here. We have to make cuts here." I don't ever hear any of you come up with like a plan that actually would pass mustard with any of us in the business community who have to run companies and make sure they're solvent. This does not seem like you have a plan or anybody else has a plan. And it's is it because it's so unpopular that you can't just say, "Hey, it's there's going to be some austerity here and it's going to be painful and there's going to be more taxes and that's going to be painful and then you don't get elected." Is that the issue?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 我确实提出过一个计划，在我2020年竞选总统时，那感觉像是另一个时代了，我平衡了每一项支出。我提议的每一项支出，我都提出了支付方案，并解释了在税收方面需要做出哪些调整。同样，这些都是我作为市长时养成的习惯，那时我必须用现金做预算。所以，看，这并非一个完全无法解决的问题。我们需要采取措施来降低像提供医疗保健这样的成本，这是对 Medicare、Medicaid 等造成压力的最大来源之一。不仅仅是让人们有保险，还有实际的潜在成本。药品也是一样。然后在收入方面，你也需要做一些事情。比如，我很抱歉，但我们不能一次又一次地从最富有的人那里削减万亿美元的税收，然后称之为一个可持续的预算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I literally did put out a plan which I balanced every single spending back when I was running for president in 2020, which feels like another lifetime. Every single thing that I proposed spending on, I also proposed to pay for and explained what would have to happen tax-wise in order to do it. And again, that's just those are the habits that I built as a mayor who had to do my budget in cash. So, look, it's not like it's a completely unsolvable problem. There are measures that we got to take to reduce things like the cost of providing healthcare, which is one of the biggest sources of pressure on Medicare, Medicaid, you name it. Not just getting people insured, but the actual underlying cost. Same with pharmaceuticals. And then there are things you got to do on the revenue side. Like I'm I'm sorry, but like we can't just slash a trillion bucks from from what the wealthiest people are paying again and again and then call this a sustainable budget.</p>
</details>

### 民主党内部的身份政治危机

**主持人:** 让我们来谈谈民主党的内部运作。我肯定你已经被问过一百次了，所以很抱歉我们是第101个问的，但在卡玛拉·哈里斯 (Kamala Harris) 的回忆录中，她部分地将你的身份作为你未被考虑为她竞选伙伴的原因。你能向我们解释一下身份在民主党政治中的作用吗？也许包括你被提名为部长时，以及后来你未被视为一个可信的副总统候选人时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask you a question about the inner workings of the Democratic party. I'm sure you've been asked this a hundred times, so sorry for us being the 101st, but in Kla Harris's memoir, she points in part to your identity as a reason why you weren't considered as her running mate. Can you explain to us the role of identity in Democratic politics? Both perhaps you on the way in when you were nominated for secretary and then maybe on the way out when you were not considered as a credible VP candidate.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 我只能说，我希望身份在我们国家的政治和我的政党的政治中扮演一个不那么核心的角色。这不仅仅是因为我可能因为某个机会被忽略了，而是因为我认为它确实主导了太多人的思维，使得我们更难建立一个跨越身份的讯息。别误会，我不认为假装身份不重要是有意义的。我不认为假装色盲是有意义的。我也不认为让它来解释一切是有意义的，这是我党极左翼形成的一种习惯，这让我们更难传达信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's just say I would love for identity to play a less central role in the politics of our country and and the politics of my party and and not just because I might have been passed over for for an opportunity, but just because I think it is it has really dominated so many people's thinking in a way that makes it harder for us to build a message across identities. I mean, don't get me wrong, I I don't think it I don't think it makes sense to pretend that identity doesn't matter. I don't think it makes sense to pretend to be colorblind. I also don't think it makes sense to allow that to explain everything, which is one of the habits that's formed, I think definitely on my party's far left, that that made it harder for us to get through,</p>
</details>

尤其当你有很多利益共享的人时。我想到的是这个国家穷人和低收入人群的经济利益，例如，他们有黑人、白人，以及各种族裔、身份和性别的人，他们可能没有听到一个统一的、对他们作为一个整体说话的信息，因为感觉我的政党就像一个沙拉吧，这里给你的群体一点东西，那里给另一个群体一点东西，再给另一个群体一点东西，但这些加起来并没有形成一个完整的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">especially when you have a lot of people whose interests are shared. I'm thinking about the economic interest of poor people and low-wealth people in this country, for example, who are black, white, and of of every ethnicity and identity and gender, of course, who maybe didn't hear a unifying message that was speaking to them as a group because it felt like my party was it was like a salad bar, like here's something for your group and here's something for another group and here's something for another group and it didn't add up into a story.</p>
</details>

现在，我认为特朗普也实行一种身份政治，一种白人身份政治，让人们感觉自己被“他者”包围，移民就像是一种入侵。我们可以深入探讨那个话题，我经常这样做，但更直接地回答你关于我党的问题是，我认为身份在我党的思维中变得过于核心了。

<details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 众所周知，我们党内有很多不同的声音。所以，你知道，有些人，如果你不说最左翼的话，他们就跟你完了。但我认为很多人相信政治是建立联盟、将人们拉入一个更大图景的理念。我会说一些话，这些话不会与我党内每个活动家团体想听的一致。没关系，这就是一部分。

<p class="english-text">Well, this is the classic issue with going from primaries to generals, right? you you are pressured to say one thing to appeal to the base in your party and then you wind up if if you're not careful saying things that make it hard for you to have credibility in a general election when you're trying to uh paint a picture that the broadest number of people possible can can see themselves in. That's nothing new.</p>

但我认为这伤害我们最深的地方是在国会。众议院有435个席位。我上次查的时候，不到十分之一的席位被认为是真正有竞争性的。最多不到40个席位有实际竞争力，这意味着在十分之九的竞选中，初选基本上就是全部。所以，你甚至不需要费心去想你在初选中采取的某个立场是否会让你更难跨党派合作，或者更难赢得人们的支持，或者在大选中将他们团结起来，因为这些选区被划分得如此不公正（gerrymandered），以至于你只需要担心你的右翼，如果你是共和党人，或者你的左翼，如果你是民主党人。我认为这是伤害我们最深的地方。

<p class="english-text">But one thing that has happened more and more and more is that that's happening in more and more races. So the presidency is always a little bit like this, but the presidency is also the one that gets painted in the broadest strokes because it's it's a campaign for the whole country and it's all the different jostling around all the issues and all the groups all boiled down into two people running for one office. But where I think this actually hurts us the most is in Congress. So we got 435 seats in the House. Last time I checked, less than one out of 10 of them is considered to be seriously competitive at best. like less than 40 are actually competitive, which means in nine out of 10 races, the primary is pretty much it. So, you never even have to bother thinking about whether some stance you took in the primary is going to make it harder for you to work across the aisle or or harder to win people over or bring them together in the general because these districts are so gerrymandered, right, that that all you have to worry about is your right flank if you're a Republican or your left flank if you're a Democrat. That's where I think it hurts us the most.</p>

### 边境安全与移民政策的困境

**主持人:** 皮特，你认为唐纳德·特朗普关闭边境的决定是正确的吗？如果不是，为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pete, do you think that Donald Trump made the right decision to close the border? And if not, why not?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 我认为他提请人们关注边境问题是正确的，拥有一个安全的边境很重要。我不相信之前边境是完全开放的。我认为现在它在功能上是关闭的，但我同意上届政府做得不够，而且做得不够早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that he is right to draw attention to the problem of the border and that it is it is important to have a secure border. I don't believe it was true that it was exactly open before. I think it is functionally closed now, but I I would agree that the last administration didn't do enough and didn't do enough early enough.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 你认为拜登为什么视而不见？策略是什么？有策略吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why do you think Biden looked the other way? What was the strategy? Was there a strategy?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 是的，我认为发生的情况是，他真的指望国会来做这件事。他出身于国会，是国会的产物，他认为国会可以达成两党共识。你知道，美国人民在做什么上实际上存在两党共识，对吧？大多数人相信的，我也相信，那就是让我们更难非法进入，更容易合法进入，并且如果你不是合法身份，更容易获得合法身份。我的意思是，大多数人、大多数国家都是这么想的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think what happened was he was really looking to Congress to do it. He came out of Congress. He was a creature of Congress and thought, you know, Congress can forge a bipartisan since, you know, there's actually a bipartisan agreement among the American people on what to do, right? Which is what most people believe, what I believe, which is let's make it harder to come in illegally and easier to come in legally and and to get legal if you're not. I mean, that's where most people are most country.</p>
</details>

是的，那也是国会山妥协空间最大的地方。然而，你知道，我想上一次我们有实际的法案来解决这个问题是在80年代。所以，我想他——这是我的猜测，我从未真正参与过移民方面的事情——但他感觉解决这个问题的方式是通过国会来完成。他觉得，你知道，他成功地通过了基础设施法案，IRA（通货膨胀削减法案）。但有趣的是，当他最终对国会放弃希望时，当很明显我们不会取得太大进展时，与此同时，你在任期后期发布了那一套行政命令，对非法越境的数量产生了重大影响。所以你得问问自己，如果那个在任期末发生的行政命令在第一年、第二年就实施了，我们现在会不会处于一个不同的境地？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And that's where most of the space for compromise has been on the hill. And yet, you know, I think it was the '8s last time we had an actual bill to fix it. So, I think he, and this is speculating, I I never really, you know, was in the middle of the immigration side of things, but I think he felt like the way to do this was to get things done in Congress, he he felt that, you know, he'd managed to get the infrastructure bill done, IRA. Um but what's interesting is when he finally gave up on Congress uh when it was clear that we just weren't going to get very far and meanwhile you had had that that exe set of executive orders that came late in the term that had a major effect on the number of illegal crossings. So you got to ask yourself if that executive order that happened toward the end if that had been done in year 1, year two, would we be in a different place?</p>
</details>

当然，现在我们处于另一个极端。我的意思是，我们有公民仅仅因为有口音或看起来是棕色皮肤就被抓起来，有时在没有律师的情况下被拘留很长一段时间，这令人恐惧。这还是公民，更不用说其他人了，他们可能不应该在这里，但他们也不应该被残忍对待，对吧？我认为你看到钟摆在这个问题上摇摆的一个原因是，我们正在看到它变得多么极端，而与此同时，我认为唯一的前进道路是一种大妥协，我们把那些相信这些简单现实的人聚集在一起：我们的经济和社会产生了一种拉力，实际上需要更多的人，为了我们的人口结构和经济的运作，而合法的进入渠道却没有足够的空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now of course we're on the other extreme. I mean, we got we got citizens who just have an accent or look brown getting picked up sometimes getting detained without access to a lawyer for a frighteningly long amount of time. And that's citizens, let alone other people who, you know, maybe they shouldn't be here, but they also shouldn't be brutalized, right? And I think one reason you see the pendulum swinging on on this is is we're seeing just how extreme it's gotten at a time when again I think the only way forward really is a kind of a grand bargain where we bring together the the the the people who believe in these simple realities that we've got an economy and a a society that exerts a pull that actually needs more people like for our demographics and our economy to work then there is room in the kind of legal pipeline to come in.</p>
</details>

**主持人:** 为了理清思路，皮特，如果由你决定，你会重新开放边境，还是会维持唐纳德·特朗普目前的立场，即“好了，现在边境关闭了，现在让我们来解决你所说的大妥协”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just to clean this up, Pete, like if you if it were up to you, would you reopen the border or would you maintain the Donald Trump position right now of okay, now it's closed, now let's figure out this grand bargain, as you say, keep</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 我们需要更精确地定义我们的意思。我的意思是，如果你指的是让非法越境变得困难，至少像现在这样困难，我认为让非法越境变得困难是件好事。但是，再说一次，我认为称之为当时“开放”或现在“关闭”，你谈论的是很多不同且重叠的事情。显然，特朗普的移民政策中有很多我认为是错误的、破坏性的，也可能是非法的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">more precise by what we mean. I mean, if you mean like having it be difficult, at least as difficult as it is now, to cross illegally. I think that's it's a good thing for it to be difficult to cross illegally. Um, but again, I think calling it open then or closed now, you're talking about a lot of different overlapping things. Obviously, there are a lot of things about Trump's immigration policy I think are wrong, destructive, possibly illegal, too.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 我可以作为这个播客上唯一的移民说句话吗？我合法移民到这里。在唐纳德·特朗普的总统任期内，我感到比在拜登总统任期内任何时候都更安全、更好。我只是想让你亲耳听到我的说法，仅供参考。

<p class="english-text">Can I just say as the only immigrant right now on this podcast who immigrated here legally, I feel much safer and better under a Donald Trump presidency than I ever did under a Biden presidency. Just want you to hear from my mouth for what that's worth.</p>

### 拜登政府内幕与认知能力

**主持人:** 我想问一个不同的问题，我真的很想了解你在拜登政府工作的感受。我们看到了一大堆爆料书籍，卡玛拉·哈里斯的书，KJP（卡琳·让-皮埃尔）的书。我们上周请了乔·曼钦，他说的一件事是，不是乔·拜登变了，而是他的幕僚们疯了，罗恩·克莱恩 (Ron Klain) 实际上是一个守门人，如果你有合理的提议，它们会进入某个黑洞然后消失。你能给我们讲讲在拜登手下工作是什么感觉吗？积极的方面，也包括消极的方面。给我们一个公正的描述。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask you a different question which is I really want to get some insight into what it was like for you to work in the Biden administration. We've had the sea of tell alls coming out, Kla Harris's book, KJP's book. We had Joe Mansion on last week and one of the things that he said is that it was not that Joe Biden changed, but that the staff were nuts and that Ron Clay was effectively a gatekeeper and if you had reasonable proposals, they would go into some black hole and die. Can you give us a sense of what it was like to work under Biden and the the positives but also the negatives? Give us a fair representation.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 是的。本着公平的精神，我应该说这是我唯一一次在联邦政府工作，除了在军队。所以我无法进行基准比较，比如比较一个白宫和另一个，或者一个总统和另一个。但我会告诉你我的经历是怎样的。他们有很高的抱负，试图迅速完成大事，尤其是在头两年，当时感觉有机会与国会两院合作来实现目标，包括投入大量精力与像乔·曼钦这样的人相处，试图确保我们维持住那个联盟，以完成像基础设施法案这样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and in the spirit of fairness, I should say this is the only time I've outside of military, it's the only time I've ever worked in the federal government. So I can't benchmark, you know, to compare one white house to another or one president to another. But I'll tell you what my experience was like. There's a high level of ambition trying to get big things done quickly, especially in the first two years when there was uh felt like there was that opportunity to uh work with both houses of Congress to make it happen, including just a ton of energy going into well among other things spending time with folks like Joe Mansion trying to make sure that that we held together that that coalition to do things like the infrastructure law.</p>
</details>

有些决定我同意，有些我不同意。也有很多时候，看起来某件事不会发生，但不知何故它就发生了。那是我认为拥有一位在参议院待了那么久的总统确实有帮助的地方，因为，你知道，当时真的感觉基础设施法案已经死了。我们现在忘了这一点，因为它发生了，而且很难想象会有其他方式，但你知道，在2021年那个夏天，它被宣布死亡了很多很多次，才最终完成。所以这些从失败边缘夺取胜利的时刻……“守门人”这个词经常被用来形容白宫工作人员。我不认为这不公平。但我也会说，这并不是什么新鲜事。你知道，“守门人”通常是“幕僚长”的另一种说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um there were calls I agree with, there were calls I disagreed with. Um, there were also a lot of times when it looked like something wasn't going to happen and then somehow it happened. And that was where I I do think it helped to have a president who spent as much time as he did in the Senate because, you know, it really felt like the infrastructure bill was dead. We forget this now cuz cuz it happened and it's kind of hard to imagine it was any other way, but you know, it was proclaimed dead many, many times in that summer of 2021 before it got done. So these moments of snatching uh uh victory from the jaws of defeat, you know, the word gatekeeper gets used a lot for White House staff. I don't think that's unfair. I would also say though that I don't say that's new. Um you know, the gatekeeper is often the the kind of other word you use for a chief of staff.</p>

**主持人:** 他是否处于认知衰退中？或者说，你第一次意识到他处于认知衰退中是什么时候？我想这可能是个更好的问题，或者怀疑他已经不胜任这份工作了。

**Pete Buttigieg:** 你能感觉到他正在变老。我的意思是，我想我们都看到了。我想我的经验是，显然，你知道，我不是每天都在白宫。大多数时候我都在外地做交通方面的工作。但是，你知道，如果我在一个活动上，我看到的和你从电视上看到的没什么两样。我认为那场辩论是一个真正的转折点。

<p class="english-text">You could feel that he was growing older. I mean, I think we all saw that. Uh, I think my experience and obviously, you know, I wasn't at the White House every day.

**主持人:** 像那样的事情发生时，一个认知能力如此衰退的人怎么会被推到那种境地？因为很明显，他们几个月前就知道这不会有好结果。他们是怎么走到那一步的？他们有多么封闭？然后我想谈谈在没有初选的情况下选择卡玛拉的事情。

<details>

How did they get to that point? How insular were they? And then I want to talk about the uh selection of Kamla without having a primary. So yeah.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 是的，我想简短的回答是，并没有一个“他们”来做那个决定，对吧？人们提供建议，但有一个“他”，像一个人决定他是否再次竞选。最终，一个人决定竞选策略并为此负责。所以，你知道，我想我无法想象核心圈子里到底发生了什么。我不是那些对话的一部分，但是，是的，我确实认为，到那场辩论的时候，情况已经非常清楚，那对他没有好处，对党也没有好处。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think the short answer is there there's not really a they that makes that decision, right? people give advice, but there's a he like one person decides if he's running again. One person decides at the end of the day on the campaign strategy and is accountable for that. Uh so, you know, I think I I can't imagine what exactly was going on in the inner circle. I wasn't I wasn't part of those conversations, but um yeah, I I do think that, you know, by the time it got to that debate, uh it was just very clear that it wasn't serving him well, wasn't serving the party well.</p>

### 科技、未来与社会转型

**主持人:** 让我们换一个更具战术性的问题。这是我给你的最后一个问题，皮特。有讨论说要把 NASA 划归交通部管辖。这是个好主意还是坏主意？请告诉我们你的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's move to a different more tactical question. This is my last question for you, Pete, which is there's some discussion about moving NASA under the Department of Transportation. Good idea, bad idea. Give us your reasoning.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 嗯，让我想想。老实说，我没有深入思考过这个问题。从自私和技术宅的角度来看，作为交通部长同时负责 NASA 的工作会非常棒。我认为总的来说，只要合理，任何时候你能在组织结构图上用一个框代替两个框，都会有一些好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let me think of it. To be honest, I haven't like deeply reflected on this. Um, at a selfish and nerdy level, it would have been amazing as Secretary of Transportation to be working NASA, too. Um, I think generally anytime you can have like one uh box or on an org chart where you where there's two, you know, as long as it's justified, I think there are some benefits to that.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，目前的方式是，如果我这么说的话，如果我们认为太空的未来将越来越多地关乎商业太空——从数据上看，这显然正在发生——我们现在这种混乱的局面：NASA 显然领导着政府驱动的太空任务；交通部实际上已经对某些事情负责，我们负责商业太空许可，我们不得不大幅加快其运作方式，因为这实际上属于 FAA 的管辖范围，很大程度上因为你必须通过国家空域才能进入太空，对吧？还有一部分属于商务部。所以，以某种方式理清这种关系是有道理的，无论是在交通部内部，还是你用一种新的方式来配置它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, definitely right now the way that it let me put it this way. If we think the future of space is going to be more and more about commercial space, which is is clearly just as a matter of numbers what's happening. The mishmash we have now where you got NASA obviously leading government-driven space missions. You got the Department of Transportation which actually already had responsibility over some things and we did commercial space licensing. We wound up having to radically accelerate how that worked. Uh because that actually comes under the FAA um largely because you have to go through the national airspace to get to space, right? And there's actually parts of it that sit with commerce. So it would make sense to disentangle that one way or the other, whether it's inside of DOT or whether you configure it a new way.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我确实认为华盛顿总体上，我的政党肯定有这个问题，过于执着于我们现在拥有的所有结构、现有的组织结构图和现有的习惯。你知道，我试图让我党接受的一个信息是，如果我们有机会再来一次，他烧毁的很多东西都不会像以前那样回来了，如果它本来就充满问题，我们为什么要把它们恢复原样呢？所以，我没有一个经过深思熟虑的答案给你，但我不会仅仅因为这是一个改变，或者仅仅因为它来自本届政府，就对改变持敌对态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I do think that Washington in general, my part is definitely guilty of this, is too attached to all of the like structures that we have right now and the existing or charts and existing habits. And you know, one message I'm trying to get my party to accept is, you know, if and when we get another chance, a lot of the things that he has burned down just aren't coming back the way they were, why would we put them back the way they used to be if it was full of problems anyway? So, I don't have a really deeply considered answer for you, but I wouldn't be hostile to a change just because it's a change or or just because it came from this administration.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Chamath Palihapitiya):** 这是我最后一个问题。今天有一份报告出来。我想 Waymo 每天的行驶里程即将超过25万英里。我们有特斯拉的 Cyber Cab 和 Robo Taxi。这些东西有实质性的能力来防止酒驾和车辆死亡事故。你认为应该怎么做？我们应该让它以目前的速度发展吗？联邦政府有责任吗？你是否希望自己当时能做得更多来加速这一进程？告诉我们关于自动驾驶及其在社会中的作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is my last question. There was a report that came out today. I think the amount of miles driven per day by Whimo is about to pass 250,000. We have Tesla with cyber cab and robo taxi. These things have a material ability to prevent drunk driving and prevent vehicular deaths. What do you think should be done? Should we let this play out at this exact pace? Is there a responsibility in from the federal government? Do you wish you had done more to accelerate this? Tell us about autonomous driving and its role in society.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 所以，我认为有潜力拯救大量生命。你知道，我们早些时候谈到了航空安全的惊人标准，对吧？每十亿人次零死亡。但在道路安全上却恰恰相反。没人谈论它。我们有一扇应急门从飞机上脱落，我们就重新考虑了整个监管框架，因为那天可能有人受伤。与此同时，每天有100到150人死于我们道路上的车祸，死于人类驾驶的车辆。我的意思是，这足以每天填满一架737。这与枪支暴力相当，每年三四万人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I think that there's the potential to save a huge number of lives. You know, we talked earlier about the incredible standard of aviation safety, right? Zero fatalities per billion better. It's the opposite on roadway safety. Nobody talks about it. I we had a plug door blow out of an airplane and we we reconsidered our whole oversight framework because somebody could have gotten hurt that day. Meanwhile, every day 100 to 150 people die on our roadways to car crashes and vehicles driven by humans. I mean, it's enough to fill a 737 every day. It's on par with gun violence. 30 40,000 people a year.</p>
</details>

所以，人类司机的记录是致命的。当我们谈论职业司机时，情况有点不同，他们有惊人的记录。我见过卡车司机有两百万英里无碰撞或事故的记录。但总的来说，我们大多数人，普通司机都认为自己比普通司机更安全。而普通司机致人死亡的几率高得惊人。所以，你知道，我认为我们已经到了一个地步，至少现在有些技术已经比人类更安全了，而且这种情况只会增加和改善。讽刺的是，你知道，即使是少数几个被高度宣传的负面事件，也会真正改变公众的接受度。所以我的方法是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, human drivers have a murderous track record. It's a little bit different when we talk about professional drivers who have incredible I mean I met truck drivers who'd have, you know, two million miles with no crashes or accidents. But just as a general rule, most of us the average driver thinks they're safer than the average driver. And the average driver stands a shockingly high percentage chance of getting somebody killed. So, you know, I think we're at the point where at least some of these technologies right now already are safer than human beings and that's only going to increase and improve. And the the irony of it is, you know, even if a handful of highly publicized uh negative incidents will will really change public acceptance. So my approach was</p>
</details>

是的。所以我的方法是，作为安全监管者，我们确实需要保守，以确保它是安全的。不是因为我不相信这项技术，而是因为我相信它，因为我认为如果人们看到它安全地发展，就会有更多的接受度。但是，我们是否可以或应该做些什么，或者本可以或应该做些什么来加速自动驾驶的普及？我认为答案是肯定的。简单的现实是，我们不能容忍人类司机每天在我们的道路上杀死超过100人，好像这没什么大不了的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they have. Yeah. Yeah. So my approach was we we do need to be conservative as a safety regular to make sure it's safe. Not because I don't believe in the technology, but because I do because I think if people see it unfolding safely, uh there's going to be more acceptance. But are there things we could or should do or could or should have done to accelerate AV adoption? Um, I think the answer is yes. Like the the simple reality is we we can't tolerate like it's no big deal human drivers killing more than 100 people a day on our roads.</p>
</details>

**主持人 (Jason Calacanis):** 这是我最后一个问题的完美引子。我们行业一直在进行一场关于工作岗位流失的大辩论。亚马逊昨天宣布，我相信你看到了，将裁减3万个白领工作岗位。UPS 今天宣布裁员约4万人。纽约时报有泄露消息称，亚马逊计划未来取消60万个工作岗位，不再招聘，因为他们坚信机器人会完成这些工作。我们都知道人工智能将是我们一生中最大的变革。我认为这没有争议。问题是，这次的工作岗位流失和新工作创造会是什么样子？皮特·布蒂吉格怎么看？你认为我们面临一个严重的问题，还是你认为我们能够应对？然后，当你成为总统时，政府的角色是什么？如果你继承了这个混乱的人工智能工作岗位流失的潜力，情况会是怎样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a perfect segue for my final question. We've had a grand debate occurring in our industry about job displacement. Uh Amazon announced yesterday, I'm sure you saw 30,000 white collar jobs to be eliminated. UPS today something around 40,000 people and there was a leak in the New York Times that Amazon was planning on eliminating 600,000 job wrecks for the future and not hiring them because they're so convinced that robotics will do that. We all know AI is going to be the biggest change of our lifetime. I don't think that's the debate. The question is um what will job displacement and new job creation look like this time? What does Pete Buddhajed think? Do you think that we have a serious issue on our hands or do you think we'll be able to navigate it? And then what's the government's role in it when you're president? What will it look like if you inherit this chaotic AI job displacement potential?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 是的，我对此非常担忧。部分原因是我在工业中西部长大。你知道，我们被告知……我在印第安纳州北部长大，那里有很多汽车行业的供应链公司。在90年代和2000年代，大量的贸易和自动化，但实际上主要是自动化进入了。每个人都被告知，你知道，不要太担心你今天做的事情，蛋糕会变得更大，以至于每个人都会过得更好。问题是，蛋糕确实变大了，但承诺的其余部分没有实现。人们很生气。人们生气是因为他们失去了收入，但也因为即使他们获得了收入，如果他们通过培训项目在增长领域找到了另一份工作，但那不是他们认为的自己，与他们的身份认同感或归属感无关，那么你就会继续有一种不仅是经济上的，而且是更深层次的流离失所。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'm I'm seriously concerned about it and and part of that's from growing up in the industrial Midwest. Like, you know, we were told I grew up in Northern Indiana, uh, a lot of auto industry supply chain companies there. And in the 90s and 2000s, a lot of trade and automation, but the truth is mostly automation came in. And uh everybody was told, you know, don't worry too much about what you're doing today. The pie is going to get so much bigger that everybody will be better off. And the thing is, the pie did get bigger, but the rest of that promise didn't come true. And people were pissed. People were pissed because they lost their income, but also even after they got their income, if if they went through a training program and got another job in a field that was growing, but it wasn't who they thought they were, it wasn't connected to their their sense of identity or belonging, then you continue to have a displacement that's not just economic, but but but really deeper than that.</p>
</details>

我实际上认为，很多这种情况直接导致了你在本届政府和这个政治时刻看到的民粹主义和民族主义。真正困扰我的是，你知道，就像我认识的任何汽车工人或电工一样，他们的归属感和身份认同在很多方面都取决于他们是汽车工人或电工。对于我认识的大多数白领工人来说，情况更是如此。在法律、软件领域工作的人，或者，你知道，你看看放射学领域正在发生的事情，仅举一例，医学领域因为人工智能正在发生真正的变化，随之而来的岗位流失我认为是巨大的，我不认为我们做好了准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I actually think a lot of that kind of leads directly to the populism and the nationalism that you see in this administration and this in this political moment. So uh and the thing that really haunts me is you know as much as any auto worker or electrical worker I know like their sense of belonging and identity you know very much depends in many ways on being an autoworker or an electrical worker. That's even more true for most white collar workers. I know people who work in law or or software or you know um uh you know you see what's happening in radiology just to take one example what's happening in medicine that's really changing because of AI and the the displacement that could come with that I think is enormous and I don't think we're prepared.</p>
</details>

是的，我不知道，你知道，我不想玩预测游戏，预测哪些事情会以什么顺序发生，但我认为很明显，它规模巨大，速度很快，正在到来，并且正在加速。我最大的担忧是，如果我们已经处于一个财富和权力集中的水平，历史上没有任何共和国能够在这种情况下幸存下来，那么这是否会成为一个让财富和权力更加集中在更少人手中的发展？我不认为它必须如此。我认为这就是好的政策可以发挥作用的地方。但我认为，如果我们只是梦游般地走进去，那可能会发生。它可能会更具破坏性。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. I don't know you know I don't want to get into prediction games about which things will happen in which order but I think it's clear that it's big. It's clear that it's fast. It's coming. It's accelerating. And my big worry is that if we're already at a level of concentration of wealth and power that no republic has ever survived, is this going to be a development that just makes wealth and power even more concentrated in even fewer hands? I don't think it has to be. I think that's where, you know, good policy can make a difference. But I think if we just sleepwalk into it, that could happen. It could be even more dabiliz.</p>

### 2028年展望与政治未来

**主持人:** 我们的朋友在 Poly Market，我相信你很了解这些预测市场以及它们的准确性。看起来加文·纽森 (Gavin Newsom) 和奇怪的是 AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez) 排在第二位，然后你排在第三位。加文显然正在奋力攀登。谁知道他是否会先中箭，但看起来你处于一个相当不错的位置。你对 Poly Market 的高手们看好谁的早期指标有何看法？

<p class="english-text">Our friends at Poly Market, I'm sure you know uh all about these uh prediction markets and how good they are. Looks like Gavin AOC oddly in second place and then yourself in third place right now. Gavin obviously is running up the hill. Who knows if he takes the arrows first, but it looks like you're in a pretty good position here. What are your thoughts here on the a early um indicators of who's connecting with the sharps over at Poly Market?</p>

**Pete Buttigieg:** 嗯，你们给我的印象不是那种会满足于6%回报的人。

**Pete Buttigieg:** 你知道，感觉时间线一直在变。我告诉你，我一点也不急于投身于总统政治。显然，这是我关心的事情，也是我已经在2020年做过一次的事情，但你知道，今年是我大约15年来第一年没有担任公职或竞选公职，我挺享受的。我的意思是，我努力工作，支持我相信的候选人。我们有一个政治行动委员会，我经常旅行和演讲，但你知道，总会有做那些事情的时候，我不会试图去催促。

<p class="english-text">So, you know, it feels like the timelines keep shifting. I'll tell you like I'm in no hurry to be in the middle of presidential politics. Obviously, it's something I care about. It's something I have done uh already once before in 2020, but you know, this year, this is the first year in in about 15 that I haven't been uh in office or running for office, and I'm kind of enjoying it. I mean, I'm I'm working hard supporting candidates I believe in. We have a a pack uh and and I travel a lot and speak a lot, but uh you know, there there will be a time for those kinds of things, and I'm not uh uh I'm not going to try to rush.</p>
