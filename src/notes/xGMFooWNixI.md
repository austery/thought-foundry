### 硅谷为何背弃民主党？

**主持人：** 欢迎大家回到 All-In 播客的访谈系列。上周我们请来了 Joe Manchin，这周 Pete Buttigieg 来到了这里。大家都认识“皮特市长”，他出生于南本德，毕业于哈佛，曾是**罗德学者**（Rhodes Scholar: 世界上最负盛名、最难申请的奖学金之一，旨在培养具有公共服务精神的未来领袖），曾在麦肯锡工作，在美国海军服役，当然，他还竞选过总统，并在拜登任内担任交通部长。欢迎来到节目，Pete Buttigieg。你好吗？

<p class="english-text">Welcome back to the All-In podcast interview series. Last week, we had Joe Manchin on. This week, Pete Buttigieg is here. Everybody knows Mayor Pete: born in South Bend, a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes scholar, worked at McKinsey, served in the US Navy, and, of course, ran for president and was the Transportation Secretary under Biden. Welcome to the program, Pete Buttigieg. How are you?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 很好，谢谢你们邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 这是我们的荣幸。这位是 Chamath Palihapitiya，他曾是民主党人，后来放弃了对贵党的支持，现在成了一名共和党人。我们这个节目的精神就是进行坦诚的讨论，我们喜欢深入细节。所以我想从你对企业家、技术专家的看法开始。我看了你在 Bill Maher 节目上的一个片段，你说：“嘿，硅谷这些**自由意志主义**（Libertarian: 一种政治哲学，强调个人自由、有限政府和自由市场）的、以科学为本的人们，他们做出了一个非常实际的决定。这些富人决定支持共和党，因为共和党往往会为富人做好事。”这些富人包括 Tim Cook、Mark Zuckerberg、Elon Musk。这些人曾长期是民主党的一份子，是民主党的大额捐助者，但他们都发生了这种转变。你认为这仅仅是基于务实的愿望，为了减少监管、获得更好的商业环境、个人赚更多钱吗？还是你认为在 2024 年的失败中有其他因素在起作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pleasure. Meet Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Democrat who renounced his support of your party and now is a Republican. And really the spirit of this program is to just have a candid discussion. We like to get into the details and so I thought I wanted to start with your perception of entrepreneurs, technologists, etc. I was watching a clip of you on Bill Maher and you said, "Hey, you know, these libertarian, science-based folks in Silicon Valley, they made a very practical decision. These are rich men who have decided to back the Republican party that tends to do good things for rich men." And these rich men include Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk. These are people who have been part of the Democratic party for a very long time, huge donors to the Democratic party, and they all made this sort of flip. Do you think it was just pragmatically based upon the desire to have less regulations, a better business environment to personally make more money or do you think there were other things at work with the loss in 2024?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 嗯，我认为你不能把它归结为任何单一的原因，但我当然认为这是故事的一部分。共和党的政策倾向于偏爱更富有的人，这已经不是什么秘密了。很多脱离民主党的人，至少是那些备受关注的人，比如这些商业人物、投资者、亿万富翁怎么会离开民主党转向共和党，这可能是一个“狗咬人”式的故事，没什么复杂的。如果你看看事实，民主党人一直极度关注财富和收入不平等，而你面对的是一群非常非常富有的人。我不认为仅仅是这个原因。我认为有很多因素同时起了作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't think you can reduce it to any one thing, but I certainly think that's part of the story. Look, it's no secret that Republican policies tend to favor people who are wealthier. And a lot of people who drifted away from the Democratic party, at least the ones who are getting a lot of attention. Like how could these business figures, investors, billionaires have gotten away from Democrats and gone to Republicans might be kind of a dog bites man story, like not something that's wildly complicated. If you look at the fact that, you know, Democrats have been extremely concerned about wealth and income inequality and you got a lot of very, very wealthy people. I don't think it was just that. I mean, I think there are a lot of things that that kind of combined at once.</p>
</details>

但是，我的很多朋友都在挠头说：“等一下，这些人来自科技和科学界。他们怎么能支持一个一直在删除科学参考文献、并在气候问题上审查科学的总统或政府呢？”他们中的许多人是自由意志主义者，怎么会支持一个向街头派遣军队、并严厉镇压自由的政府呢？这简直就像是我保守派和自由意志主义朋友们在我们喝着啤酒争论政治时做的噩梦，我从没想过会看到这种事发生。这些人中，有些是同性恋，他们怎么能支持一个确实攻击了 LGBT 权益的政府呢？如果你逐一列举，会发现很多事情都与直觉相悖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, for a lot of my friends who are scratching their heads saying, "Wait a minute, these are folks who are from the tech and science world. How could they back a president or administration that's been deleting references to science and kind of censoring science at least anytime that climate is concerned?" A lot of these guys are libertarian. How could they be on board with the administration that is sending troops into streets and has really led a crackdown on freedom. That's kind of something out of the fever dreams of my conservative and libertarian friends back when we were, you know, arguing about politics over beers that I never thought I would see happen. These folks, some of these folks are gay and how can they be backing an administration that's, you know, really assaulted LGBT rights? And you know, if you just go down the list, there's a lot of things that are counterintuitive.</p>
</details>

关于一些硅谷领袖的转变，他们中许多人从非常活跃的民主党人转变为支持特朗普，这其中有很多反直觉的地方。对于这个反直觉的现象，或许有一个直观的答案，那就是他们中的许多人觉得，共和党更能服务于他们短期的商业利益或个人财务利益。我理解这一点。但我会反驳，就像硅谷里很多仍然是民主党人的人会反驳的那样：一个健康的商业环境，你当然不希望被过度监管，但你也希望身处一个有法治的环境。你希望在一个可以大声说出科学真理的地方。你希望在一个没有人能将他们对宗教的解释强加于他人的地方。我对此有一整套反驳的论点。但我认为，这就是我们在 2020 年到 2024 年这短短几年里陷入的漩涡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">About some of these Silicon Valley leaders who flipped, in many cases flipped from being very, very active Democrats to backing Trump. And you know, maybe there's an intuitive answer to that counterintuitive thing, which is that many of them feel their short-term business interests or personal financial interests are better served by Republicans. I get that. I would counter, as I think a lot of people in Silicon Valley who are still Democrats would, that look, a healthy business environment, you know, you don't want to be overregulated, but you also want to make sure you're an environment with rule of law. You want to be in a place where it's safe to say scientific truths out loud. You want to be in a place where somebody can't impose their interpretation of their religion on other people. I, you know, I have a whole counter to that. But, you know, I think that's the kind of swirl that we got into, definitely just in those short years between 2020 and 24.</p>
</details>

### 审查制度与“虚假对等”

**主持人：** 你认为拜登政府在科学真理等方面存在审查吗？让我们以新冠疫情为例，拜登政府似乎有后门可以进入像 Facebook 和 Twitter 这样的平台，来压制你刚才提到的科学思想和辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think that there was censorship under the Biden administration for things like scientific truth? Let's just focus on COVID for a second and the back doors that it seemed that the Biden administration had to places like Facebook and places like Twitter to just suppress scientific thought and debate as you just talked about.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 这是我见过的关于“虚假对等”的一个惊人例子。是的，我承认，我想很多人会说，在政府试图确保不良信息或错误信息不被推入公共卫生对话中，并与那些试图负责任、做正确事情的社交媒体公司接触时，有些时候确实靠得太近了。可能有些时候他们做错了或做得过火了。但现在，我们所处的时刻是，美国总统不喜欢被一个喜剧演员批评，就让**FCC**（Federal Communications Commission: 美国联邦通信委员会，负责监管州际和国际通信）的负责人去威胁那些试图收购电视网络的公司，说“你们可以选容易的方式，也可以选难的方式”。这完全是另一个层级的审查。更不用说他们如何审查每一个政府网站，删除任何可能意外提及气候变化的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is an amazing example of some of the false equivalencies that I've seen thrown around out there. So yeah, I would acknowledge I think a lot of folks would say that it came really close to the stove some of the times when the administration was trying to make sure that bad information or misinformation wasn't being pushed into the kind of public health conversation and was engaging social media companies that were trying to you know be responsible and do the right thing and and there might be moments that that you know they got that wrong or went too far. But right now, we're in a moment, right, where the president of the United States doesn't like being criticized by a comedian and has the head of the FCC, which regulates corporations that are trying to buy TV networks, go out and threaten them and say, you know, you're we can do this the easy way or the hard way. I mean, that is a whole different level of censorship. Not to mention just the way they've gone through like every government website, right, and deleted anything that could accidentally be a reference to climate change.</p>
</details>

所以我担心这里的虚假对等。你当然可以说，在上一届政府或任何一届政府中，都有一些时刻我们可以争论，为了忠于言论自由，你应该这样做而不是那样做，或者这些边缘案例应该有所不同。但我很紧张，任何人会把一个总统试图指挥摧毁他不仅不喜欢的记者，还有喜剧演员的行为，与公共卫生部门在导致一百万美国人死亡的公共卫生紧急事件中，尽力确保人们获得良好公共卫生信息的行为等同起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, I'm worried about the false equivalencies here. You could definitely say there were moments under the last administration or any administration where we could argue that that having fidelity to to free speech, you know, you should have done this way instead of that way or these edge cases should have been different. But but I am nervous that anybody would equate a president trying to direct the destruction not only of journalists but of comedians that he doesn't like with public health authorities in a public health emergency that killed a million Americans doing their best to try to make sure that people got good public health information.</p>
</details>

### 财富税与政府责任

**主持人：** 让我们谈谈关键问题，也就是税收政策。我认为，我们看到的很多反复，以及民主党为何失去了所有这些创造了我们国家所有就业和税基的优秀企业家和资本家，都与此有关。最近有两个税收提案，纽约市有人提议对最高收入者征收 54% 的税。在加州，有人提出法案要对亿万富翁征收 5% 的财富税。在最近的一次集会上，人们高喊“向富人征税”。而 Elizabeth Warren 和 Bernie Sanders，我认为他们比你更左，他们说“嘿，取缔亿万富翁”。我们现在有这样一种运动，认为成为亿万富翁在某种程度上是不道德或不合伦理的。所以，让我们从一些实际问题开始。你是否会支持财富税？显然你会在 2028 年再次竞选总统，而且你是领先的候选人之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk a little bit about where the rubber meets the road, which is tax policy. And I think a lot of what we've seen in this back and forth to add to why the Democrats lost all of these amazing entrepreneurs and capitalists who build these amazing companies that create all the jobs in the tax base for this country. Two tax proposals recently, New York City with Mandami and I don't know if you've come out and publicly supported him yet, but he's proposing 54% tax for the top earners there. Here in California, we have the floating of a bill to charge a wealth tax of 5% on billionaires. At a recent Mandami rally, they were chanting tax the rich. And Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, who I think are far left of you, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, are saying, "Hey, ban the billionaires." And we have this sort of movement that being a billionaire is in some way immoral or unethical. So, let's start with some brass tax here. Would you support, and obviously you're going to run for president again in 2028, and you're one of the lead candidates. Would you ever support a wealth tax?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 原则上，也许会。是的。你说的很对，像 Bernie 这样的人确实比我更左。我不了解你刚才提到的州和地方提案的细节，但从表面上看，它们似乎比我愿意走的更远。但实际上，我们对各种各样的事物征税，对吧？有所得税、工资税、财产税。财富税有点类似于财产税。当然，其想法是，有很多人的财富变得难以置信地多。重要的是，在现行的税收制度下，最富有的人积累收入的方式越来越少地被记为“收入”。这就是为什么你会听到那些拥有数十亿美元的公司或个人，其实际税率竟然低于教师或消防员的故事。我想大多数人都明白这是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In principle, maybe. Yeah. I mean, you rightly said, you know, folks like Bernie are to my left. I don't know the details of the state and local proposals you just mentioned, but those sound on their face like they're further than I would go. But look, in reality, we tax across a variety of things, right? There's income tax, there's payroll tax, there's property tax. Wealth tax would be kind of along the lines of a property tax. And the thought, of course, is that you've got a lot of folks who become incredibly wealthy. And importantly, the way taxation works now, less and less of the way the wealthiest people accumulate their income is actually booked as income, right? And this is why you have these stories of, you know, multi-billion dollar corporations or multi-billion dollar individuals somehow paying an effective tax rate that's lower than a teacher or a firefighter. And I think most people get that that's wrong.</p>
</details>

所以我的总体看法是，任何事情都需要平衡，都有其限度。但如果你问我，现在美国最富有的人是缴税太多还是太少？我会说，最富有的人缴税太少了。无论你是通过所得税来调整，还是通过像财富税这样的东西来调整，有很多方法可以做到。我认为重要的是要公平、合理，并且要确保那些从我们的体系中获得巨大回报的人能够为其做出贡献，同时又不能极端到扼杀财富创造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I guess my overall take is, you know, everything has a balance, everything has limits, but if if you're asking me the question, are the wealthiest people in America right now paying too much tax or too little tax? I would say the wealthiest are paying too little tax. and whether you adjust that through income tax, whether you adjust that through, you know, something like a wealth tax. And there's a lot of ways to do it. I think what's important is that it's fair, that it makes sense, and and that you do it in a way that that can make sure that the people who are spectacularly rewarded by our system are contributing to it without being so extreme that that you know, you're you're you're crushing wealth creation.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在你看来，美国政府对其收到的税款有什么责任？我们如何知道这些钱是被恰当、有效地使用了，而不是用于个人项目、政治分肥，或者干脆就是浪费和贪污？界限在哪里？请给我们一些例子，说明你将如何确保在税收增加的同时，问责制也随之加强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the responsibility of the US government in your eyes with the tax receipts that they get? How do we understand that money is being spent appropriately and well versus pet projects or pork barrel spending or frankly just waste and grift. Where is that line? And give us some examples of how you would make sure that as tax receipts went up, accountability went up with it.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 是的，我认为这非常重要，人们纳税的意愿在某种程度上取决于他们是否觉得自己的钱花得值。我最初是当市长起步的。作为南本德市，我们不能随心所欲地印更多的钱。我们实行现金预算，每年都必须平衡。如果我们举债，就必须认真考虑如何偿还。我们确保每当要求人们向城市缴纳税收时，他们都清楚自己能得到什么，无论是警察服务、公园还是垃圾清运。我认为用这个比喻来思考国家层面的运作方式也不算太糟，对吧？我们应该相信我们能得到好的服务、好的基础设施。这显然是我在联邦层面担任交通部长时的工作内容。我们应该得到好的国防以及我们作为一个国家所做的所有其他事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think that's that's super important and and people's willingness to pay taxes depends on some level on their, you know, sense that they're getting good value for their money. So, I I cut my teeth as a mayor. We didn't we couldn't uh, you know, print more dollars if we wanted to. As the city of South Bend, we had a cash budget, had to balance it every year. If we took on debt, we really had to think hard about how we were going to pay on that debt. We made sure that any time we're asking people to be paying revenue into the city, they know what they're getting for that. Whether it's police service or parks or trash pickup, I don't think that's the worst metaphor to think about how things should work at the national level, too, right? We we should believe that we're getting good services, good infrastructure. That was obviously what what I worked on when I was uh at the federal level as as Secretary of Transportation. We should get good national defense and all the other things that we, you know, as a country are</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你如何确保资金不被浪费？举个例子，你从《基础设施与就业法案》中获得了数十亿美元用于部署充电基础设施，对吧？但截至今年，这些充电站只有几百个。这几乎可以说是一次彻底的失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you how do you make sure that it's not wasted? Like I'll give you an example. You had billions and billions of dollars allocated to you from the infrastructure and jobs act to deploy charging infrastructure, right? And as of this year, there's only a few hundred of these charging stations. It's been pretty much an abject failure.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 这不是真的。我很高兴你提出这一点，因为它实际上是我们必须处理的最大烟幕弹之一。这是一个旨在到 2030 年部署电动汽车充电桩的项目。当时的想法是，到 2030 年，我们认为全国约一半的汽车销量将是电动汽车。为了让这顺利进行，我们需要更多的充电桩。市场在很多地方都能很好地提供充电桩，但我们发现在其他一些地方，比如收入较低或更偏远的农村地区，私营部门来做这件事在经济上是划不来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh that's not true. And and I'm really glad you raised that because it's actually one of the biggest red herrings we had to deal with. So this is a program to get EV chargers deployed by 2030. The thought was, you know, by 2030, we think about half of the sales or we were hoping about half the sales of cars in the country would be EVs. Now, in order to have that work well, we're going to need more chargers. The market does a good job of delivering chargers in a lot of places, but there were other places where we found it was lower income or it was more rural. It was more spread out and it just wasn't going to pencil for the private sector to do to do it, right?</p>
</details>

所以，我们有一个名为 **NEVI**（National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure: 国家电动汽车基础设施计划）的基金，就像你说的，大约有 70 亿美元，用于弥补差价，补贴或直接在需要的地方建造这些充电桩。我们做出了几个选择，我们知道这会让项目耗时更长，但我们觉得可以接受。其中之一是由各州主导。所以，我们不是坐在华盛顿决定所有充电桩应该建在哪里，而是将资金下发给各州，让他们建立自己的项目。重要的是，我们允许他们以不同的方式建立项目。我们没有规定怀俄明州与西弗吉尼亚州的最优补贴是多少，或者你是否应该通过补贴来做，还是由州政府拥有和运营。我们在这方面退了一步，让各州去创新，即使这意味着他们需要一段时间来完善项目，因为我们知道大多数充电桩会在 2026 年、2027 年安装，但远早于 2030 年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh we had a fund uh called NEVI. uh I can't even remember what the acronym was, but the point was it was like you said about $7 billion uh to buy down the difference to uh subsidize or just outright build those chargers in places where they were needed. And we made a couple of choices uh that we knew would mean that it would take longer, but we were okay with that. One of them was to have it led by the states. So instead of sitting there in Washington saying where all the chargers ought to be built, we send the funding to the states. We let them set up their own program. And importantly, we let them set up their own programs differently. So, you know, we were going to dictate what the optimal subsidy was in Wyoming compared to West Virginia or whether you even do it through a subsidy or whether it's owned and operated by the state. We took we took a step back on that, let the states innovate, even if that means it's going to take a while for them to polish the program, knowing that that meant most of the chargers would go in in 2026, 2027, but well ahead of 2030.</p>
</details>

第二点，这也非常重要。我们做出了一个有意识的决定，坚持充电桩必须在美国制造。当你这样做时，你就是在决定项目会花费更长的时间。我承认这一点，因为直接从中国购买现成的产品会快得多。我们认为这是值得的，因为我们认为拥有一个以美国为基础的产业很重要，由美国工人，最好是工会的电工，来制造和安装这些充电桩。同样，我们知道如果目标是在 2023 年或 2024 年前全部完成，我们就不可能有这样做的余地。但由于我们认为大部分充电桩的需求要到 2030 年才会出现，所以我们对此表示可以接受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the second thing, this is really important, too. We made a conscious decision to insist that the Chargers be made in America. Now, when you do that, you're deciding that it's going to take longer. I'll just admit that because just buy them off the shelf from China would be dramatically quicker. We thought that was worth it because we thought it was important to have a US-based industry with, you know, American workers, ideally union electrical workers, uh, making and installing these chargers. Again, we knew that if if the goal was to get them all done by like 2023 or 2024, we wouldn't have had the luxury of doing that. But since we thought most of the charges would be needed by well, by 2030, we were okay with that.</p>
</details>

现在，华盛顿的政治游戏来了。有人拿到了数据，看到这是一个七八十亿美元的项目，然后错误地试图让它看起来像是我们已经把这七八十亿美元花在了他们已经设法先建好的少数几个充电桩上，尽管我们从未想过大部分充电桩会在我们的第一个任期内建成。这就是华盛顿游戏的玩法，对吧？拿一个还在进行中的项目——最终结果还未定，我们将看看特朗普政府如何完成这个项目——在项目运行结束之前，你其实无法判断它是否成功。但他们移动了球门。我不是在挑战你，说政府开支中没有浪费或不好的事情发生，我不喜欢这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here comes Washington politics, right? And somebody gets a hold of the numbers. They see it's a seven or eight billion dollar program and then falsely try to make it look like we spent the seven or eight billion dollars already on the handful of chargers that that they already managed to build first even though we never thought most of the charges would be built even during our first term. And that's where the Washington game comes in, right? Take something that I mean the jury is still out, right? The program's not done. We'll see how the Trump administration does in completing the program. But, you know, you can't really say whether it was a success or a failure until the program's been run. But they move the goalpost. And I'm not challenging you that like there's waste that there's uh bad things that happen in and and and government spending that I don't like. But</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 总的来说，你最好的猜测是什么？美国纳税人交给美国政府的每一美元中，有多少真正用于惠及美国人的生产性项目，又有多少被流失掉了？你最好的猜测是什么？是每美元 50 美分，10 美分，一分钱，还是 90 美分？你最好的猜测是什么？你曾在这些组织的内部工作过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's your what's your best guess in general? For every dollar that gets given to the United States government by US taxpayers, what actually lands in productive programs that benefit Americans versus what gets leaked away? What's your best guess? Is it 50 cents of every dollar, 10 cents of every dollar, a penny, 90 cents? Like what is your best guess? you've been in the bowels of these organizations.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我在交通部的经验是，大部分资金都用在了非常有益的地方。如果你把它分解来看，它用于维持航空部门的安全运营，用于高速公路、道路和桥梁等。这是我们在基础设施一揽子计划中最大的一笔资金。当政府问责办公室或监察长——顺便说一句，这些都是特朗普现在正在摧毁的机构——这些进行审计并以两党合作方式深入调查的组织，在涉及直接欺诈方面，他们得出的数字通常远低于 1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So my experience in transportation is that most of it goes to very good use. I mean if you just break it down uh it goes to things that keep the aviation sector operating safely. It goes to things like highways, roads and bridges. That was the biggest slug of funding that we had in the infrastructure package. uh and when you know the general or the government accountability office or or the inspector general by the way institutions that Trump is demolishing right now but the organizations that do the auditing and really dig in on a bipartisan basis um often in terms of outright fraud you know they're going to come in a number that's well below 1%.</p>
</details>

但我也看到过，就拿我在军队的经历来说吧。我记得有一栋建筑，我想是在莱瑟内克，也许是坎大哈，但我想是莱瑟内克。我到那里时，那栋建筑已经建了好几年，花了大概 3000 万美元。就在他们准备启用之前，他们又把它拆了。这完全是个烂尾工程。我们确实看到类似的事情发生。我们看到很多项目的成本不断攀升。所以，这和欺诈不一样，欺诈可能不到 1%，但如果你有一个项目成本比应有成本高出 1%、10% 甚至 100%，那仍然是巨大的浪费。我的意思是，根据定义，建造某物所花费的每一分钱，只要超过了实际所需，就是浪费。我确实认为这种情况很多。我认为政府在程序上碍手碍脚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but but but you know I've also seen my own sense as effective... no effectively this is this comes to the other part I was going to say I mean I think about my time in the military for example. You know there was a building. I think it was Leatherneck. Maybe it was Kandahar, but I think it was Leatherneck. When I traveled out there, there was a building that had taken years to go up. I think it was like $30 million. And just before they were about to activate it, uh, they tore it back down. I mean, it's just a complete boondoggle. And and we see stuff like that happening for sure. We see cost escalations on a lot of projects. So, it's not, you know, it's not the same as fraud. I mean that's the like under 1% but it's still a huge waste if you have a project cost 1% or 10% or sometimes 100% more than it should right I mean by definition every penny it takes to build something more than what it was actually required is wasted and I do think there's a lot of that I think government gets in its own way with procedure.</p>

**主持人：** 作为部长，你有多大权力来阻止这种浪费？如果你看到了，你会怎么做？我给你一个具体的例子。2023 年，**FAA**（Federal Aviation Administration: 美国联邦航空管理局）出现了一些非常严重的系统中断。我们现在都知道我们的航空安全基础设施极其脆弱，需要升级。你在 23 年看到了 sürekli 的中断。你做了什么来阻止这种情况？当你看到浪费时，你如何阻止它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just explain to us as a secretary how much control do you have in stopping that waste So if you see it, so I'll give you a specific example. In 2023, there was some pretty incredible outages in the FAA. We've all now learned that we have an incredibly brittle air safety infrastructure that needs to be upgraded. You saw that in 23 there was outages all the time. What do you do to stop that? And when you see the waste, how do you stop it?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 那是一个我们需要投资的例子，对吧？所以这是一个艰难的处境，需要硬着头皮去国会和纳税人面前说：“听着，我们需要更多的资金来做这件事。”但我们就是这么做的。顺便说一句，这是我少数几个与我的继任者意见一致的领域之一，他也做了几乎同样的事情，以确保我们获得升级技术所需的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, that was an example where we needed to invest, right? So, it's that tough situation and needing to swallow hard and go before Congress and the taxpayer and say, "Look, we need more funding for this." But that's what we did. And by the way, this is one of the rare areas where I agree with my successor who's done pretty much the same thing uh to make sure we got the funding to upgrade the technology.</p>
</details>

这可能是少数几个听众足够专业，可以让我稍微“极客”一下，谈谈我们正在进行的通信骨干网大升级。我们要从 **TDM**（Time-Division Multiplexing: 时分复用，一种较旧的电信技术）升级到 **IP**（Internet Protocol: 互联网协议），从铜缆升级到光纤。我想很多人会惊讶地发现，我们如此重要且理论上现代化的航空系统，竟然还在使用 TDM。所以这显然需要升级。我们启动了一份合同，Verizon 是承包商。你知道，当你的系统需要达到不是五个九（99.999%），而是十亿分之一的出错率，并且全年无休 24/7 运行时，这是一个多年的、数十亿美元的 IT 合同。这很有挑战性，需要时间。但你知道，这就是我们对那个特定问题感到非常紧迫的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this is one of the few audiences might be nerdy enough that that I can geek out a little bit and talk about the big upgrade to the communications backbone that that we were doing. It was to go from TDM to IP from from copper to fiber and to I think a lot of people would be astonished to know that you know something as important and theoretically modern as our aviation system uh is working on TDM. Uh so that obviously had to be upgraded. We launched a contract. Verizon is the contractor. You know, obviously a multi-year multi-billion dollar IT contract when you have to have, you know, not even 59s but like billion to one uh chance of anything going wrong 24 by7 by 365. You know, it's challenging and it takes a while. But, you know, that's one of the reasons why we felt a lot of urgency on that particular issue.</p>
</details>

但同样，看待这个问题有两种方式，两者都是真实的。一种是审视这个系统，然后说，这个系统怎么能不更现代化呢？我们需要更好地利用投入到系统中的资金，来拥有更先进的通信基础设施，拥有更多装备精良、休息充分的管制员，FAA 在这方面必须做得更好。另一种看待方式是，思考这个国家航空安全所取得的文明成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, there's two ways of looking at this, right? Both of which are true. One thing is to look at the system and say how can the system not be more modern like we need to make better use of the dollars that go into the system to have more up-to-date communications infrastructure to have uh more controllers uh who are both well equipped and well-rested and FA's got to do better on that. The other way to look at it is consider the civilizational achievement that is aviation safety in this country.</p>
</details>

人们很容易抱怨，我也会抱怨，而且不仅仅是抱怨。作为一名乘客，我对航空业的很多事情都感到非常不满，这也是为什么我们如此强硬地推动航空公司加强乘客保护。但是，在我担任部长的四年里，我们大约有 40 亿人次的乘客。也就是说，有 40 亿次有人登上飞机。而在这 40 亿次中，商业航空公司的坠机死亡人数为零。换句话说，这个有点笨拙、不完美的联邦政府所取得的成就，是在一种涉及以接近音速的速度、靠着易燃液体在离地数英里的高空飞行的交通方式上，达到了一个安全标准。坦白说，你和我，我们中的一个，不是开玩笑，更有可能在这次录制期间因自然原因随机死亡，而不是遭遇商业航空公司的致命事故。

<p class="english-text">So it's easy to grumble and I grumble and more than grumble. I mean, I got pretty upset with a lot of things about how aviation works as a passenger, which is why we pushed airlines so hard on on passenger protections. But, you know, just in the four years I was secretary, we had about 4 billion passenger implants. So, 4 billion times somebody got on an airplane, right? Um, and zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of that 4 billion. In other words, what this kind of clunky, imperfect federal government has achieved is a standard of safety on afford a form of transportation that involves being propelled through the air almost at the speed of sound by flammable liquids miles above the ground. And you know, frankly, you and I are one of us is more likely, not to be flip about it, but one of us is more likely to randomly die of natural causes during this taping than to be involved in a commercial airline fatality.</p>

### 政府与市场的边界

**主持人：** 当你现在四十多岁，见识了世界很多地方，无论是你的兵役经历，还是作为一个小镇的市长，再到在内阁任职。你对自由市场动态解决问题与政府解决问题的看法，是否有所演变？因为当我们谈论这些问题时，你看看太空领域正在发生什么。多亏了 Elon Musk 和 SpaceX，我们现在进入太空的成本只有过去的 5%。多亏了特斯拉和其他一些公司，比如 ChargePoint，我们的超级充电桩和充电桩无处不在。当涉及到向农村地区铺设光纤时，FTC 曾试图这样做，他们计划每户花费 5000 到 25000 美元。而现在我们有了 Starlink 和它的竞争对手。又是 Elon，而你的政党在拜登领导下，甚至决定不邀请他参加电动汽车峰会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How has your view of free market dynamic solving problems versus the government solving problems evolved if at all? Because when we talk about these problems, you look at what's happening with space. We now can get to space for, you know, 5% of the cost than we used to. Thanks to Elon Musk and SpaceX, we have superchargers and chargers everywhere thanks to Tesla and a number of other folks putting them out there, Charge Point, etc. when it comes to putting fiber into rural areas, which the FTC was trying to do, they were going to spend5 to $25,000 per home. And now we have Starlink and their competitors. Again, back to Elon, which your party decided under Biden, you wouldn't even invite the guy to the EV summit.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我认为将这个问题看作不是“应该是政府还是私营部门”，而是“哪些部分应该由政府做，哪些部分应该由私营部门做”非常重要。对我来说，一个典型的例子就是智能手机。我无法想象由联邦政府设计的智能手机会是多么漂亮的东西。事实上，我在军队里处理过一些可以称之为“应用程序”的软件，即使是承包商做的，你也能看出那是政府设计的，而且不好看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's really important to think of this as not like should it be government or should it be the private sector but like which parts should government do and which parts should the private sector do. So to me like the classic example is just the smartphone right. Um, I cannot imagine that a smartphone designed by the federal government would be a pretty thing or that an app designed by a matter of fact having been in the military and and dealt with I guess you could call them apps like some of the kind of uh software that that that you have to deal with even if it's done by contractors. It's kind of done in a way that you can tell was designed by the government and and and it's not pretty.</p>
</details>

另一方面，当你谈到资本配置时，联邦政府实际上发明了互联网，对吧？所以有些价值万亿美元的想法，私营部门就是不会去做，因为在经济上不划算，或者因为存在某种市场失灵。这时候就需要政府。比如基础研究，比如填补网络效应方面的空白，像宽带、电动汽车充电网络这类事情，大部分可以由私营部门做得很好，但有些部分除非有联邦政府的参与，否则就是无法衔接。这就是我们对待电动汽车等问题的态度。我从未想过我们要创造一个政府版的电动汽车，或者说你需要政府来确保向电动的转型发生。但我们确实相信，为了让它在美国制造，为了让它尽快发生，为了让它惠及那些可能负担不起初始购买成本的人——我们真正想帮助的人——政策和资金就能发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, on the other hand, you know, when you talk about capital allocation, the federal government literally invented the internet, right? So, there's things there's certain trillion dollar ideas that the private sector just won't do cuz it doesn't pencil or because of whatever market failure is there. That's where you need government. That's things like basic research. That's things like filling in gaps that especially on network effects like you know broadband, EV charging networks, that sort of thing where the bulk of it can be done quite well by the private sector, but there are pieces that just don't click unless you have unless you have federal involvement. And that's the attitude we tried to take on things like EVs. Like I never thought that we were going to, you know, create a government EV or that you even needed the government to make sure that a transition to electric happened. But we did believe that for it to be made in America, for it to happen as quickly as we wanted, and for it to reach people who maybe couldn't afford those those initial buyin costs who we really wanted to help out, you know, that's where there's a role for policy. That's where there's a role for funding.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 但让我困惑的是，Pete，一方面你说政府应该设立这些明确的“登月计划”目标来推动美国发展。但另一方面，如果你在实现这些目标方面做得太好，我们又想把其中的一大部分拿走。你如何调和这一点？你认为这对那些想要学习、追求卓越、敢于冒险，同时也希望相信如果他们冒险并获得回报，那是他们应得的年轻男女的动机有何影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I get confused though, Pete, is like on the one hand, you're saying the government should set up these clear moonshot objectives that advance America for itself and relative to other countries. But then the other side is that if you do too well achieving those objectives, we want to go and take a bunch of that away from you. How do you reconcile that? And how do you think it impacts the the motivations of young men and women who want to learn and excel and put themselves at risk but also want to believe that if they put themselves at risk and then they are rewarded that they've earned those rewards.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 听着，我喜欢人们有创业精神，创造一些东西并因此做得很好。但如果你创造了垄断，我可能不喜欢。如果你伤害了别人，我可能不喜欢。如果你把权力极度集中到自己手中，我可能不喜欢，因为那不符合美国精神。但总的来说，如果我们谈论税收，我只是想确保那些非常富有的人尽自己的一份力，为一个帮助他们茁壮成长的系统做出贡献。因为这才是下一代能做得好的前提，也是我们所有人能做得好的前提。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Look, uh I love people being entrepreneurial, creating something and doing well by it. I mean that's but to a certain basic idea only to a certain level like beyond a certain point of entrepreneurship if you create a monopoly. Yeah. If you create a monopoly I might not like it. If you hurt other people I might not like it. If you concentrate power into your hands to an extreme extent I might not like it because that's just that's just not American. But in general if we're talking about taxation I just want to make sure people who are really well off do their part to pay into a system that has helped them to thrive. uh because uh you know that's what it takes for the next generation to do well and that's what it took for all of us to do well.

### 失控的国债与两党共识的缺失

**主持人：** 我们现在能谈谈债务问题吗？我们刚刚突破了 38 万亿美元。看起来我们每年增加 2 万亿美元。你对这个的可持续性有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we go to debt maybe um as part of this? We just hit 38 trillion. So, it seems like we're adding 2 trillion a year. What's your take on the sustainability of this?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 首先，我们现在的债务路径是不可持续的。在这一点上，你说得对，两党都没有光彩的表现。这也是我与我党内一些人意见相左的地方。我认为很长一段时间以来，你从民主党人那里听到的信息基本上是债务不重要，或者根本没有这回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, the the debt path we're on is not sustainable. And that's one area where you're right, neither party has covered themselves in glory. And it's an area where I would part with some in my own party. I think for too long you've heard the message from Democrats is basically debt doesn't matter like or there's no such thing.</p>
</details>

曾经有一段时间，这听起来似乎更可信一些。几年前的一些证据为所谓的**现代货币理论**（Modern Monetary Theory: 一种非主流宏观经济学理论，认为主权政府无需担心赤字，因为它可以印钞来偿还债务）提供了很多支持。我认为现在很多情况看起来不一样了。然后是共和党人，他们说债务很重要，但行动却恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there was a moment when this felt a little more credible. Some of the evidence at as of a few years ago uh put a lot of wind in the sales of what was called modern monetary theory. Uh I think a lot of that looks different now. It looks different. And then you had the And then you had the Republicans, right, who say that debt matters but then uh act the exact opposite.</p>
</details>

作为一个好的民主党人，我可以指出，我认为在你举债修复道路桥梁和其他生产性基础设施所获得的回报，与你为了给国内最富有的人大规模减税而引爆债务之间，存在着差异。因为后者从未产生过预期的增长。我的意思是，**拉弗曲线**（Laffer Curve: 一种理论，描述税率与税收收入之间的关系，认为税率过高会抑制经济活动，从而减少税收）在经验上已经崩溃了，它根本不是那样运作的。所以我可以争论，如果你要举债，最好的用途是什么。我认为最好的用途是教育、医疗保健、投资于确保孩子不中铅毒、投资于港口和道路，而不是投资于为那些根本不需要、甚至在某些情况下并没有真正要求的极富有人群减税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, look, as as a good Democrat, I could point out that I would argue there's a difference in terms of what history empirically has shown us in terms of the return on investment you get when you raise debt to fix roads and bridges and other productive infrastructure versus if you blow up the debt in order to give massive tax breaks to the wealthiest people in the country. because that has just never generated the growth that you know I mean the laugher curve has collapsed empirically and it just doesn't work that way right so I could quibble over if you're going to do debt what's the best thing to do with it and I would argue the best thing to do with it is education healthcare investing it make sure kids don't get lead poisoned investing it in ports and roads and not investing it in uh uh you know in tax cuts for extremely wealthy people who who didn't need them and in some cases weren't really asking for it and were perfectly productive in fact history would say more productive at times in history when they were paying more taxes in the US.</p>
</details>

但抛开党派之争，我确实想回过头来再次同意你的观点，即我们现在的处境是不可持续的。与左翼一些人的说法相反，债务是真实存在的，它很重要，我们需要确保我们未来的做法更符合一些基本的财政责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But leaving that partisan fight aside, I do want to come back and agree with you again that that where we are right now is not sustainable. That contrary to what some on the left would say, there is such a thing as the debt. It does matter and we need to make sure that what we're doing going forward is more consistent with with some basic fiscal responsibility.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 什么是财政责任？我一次又一次地从你们这些政客口中听到这些政治说辞，但我从未听到任何人说：“听着，我们得勒紧裤腰带了。我们将不得不削减失业救济金，我们必须在这里削减开支，在那里提高税收。”我从没听过你们中任何人提出一个能通过我们商界人士审查的计划，我们必须经营公司并确保它们有偿付能力。这看起来你们没有任何计划。是不是因为这太不受欢迎了，以至于你不能直接说：“嘿，这里会有一些紧缩政策，会很痛苦，还会有更多的税收，也会很痛苦，然后你就选不上了。”是这个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the fiscal responsibility? I mean, I hear all these, you know, political speak over and over again from you guys, but I never hear anybody say, "You know what? We got to tighten our belts, folks. We're going to have to cut unemployment. We have to cut these uh and we're going to have to raise taxes here. We have to make cuts here." I don't ever hear any of you come up with like a plan that actually would pass mustard with any of us in the business community who have to run companies and make sure they're solvent. This does not seem like you have a plan or anybody else has a plan. And it's is it because it's so unpopular that you can't just say, "Hey, it's there's going to be some austerity here and it's going to be painful and there's going to be more taxes and that's going to be painful and then you don't get elected." Is that the issue?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我确实发布过一个计划，在我 2020 年竞选总统时，那感觉像是另一个时代了。我提出的每一项支出，都提出了相应的支付方案，并解释了为了实现它，税收方面需要做出哪些调整。这些都是我作为市长时养成的习惯，因为我必须用现金来做预算。所以，这并非一个完全无解的问题。我们需要采取措施来降低像提供医疗保健这样的成本，这是对 Medicare、Medicaid 等造成压力的最大来源之一。不仅仅是让人们有保险，还有实际的潜在成本。药品也是一样。然后在收入方面也需要做一些事情。我很抱歉，但我们不能一次又一次地从最富有的人那里削减万亿美元的税收，然后还称这是一个可持续的预算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I literally did put out a plan which I balanced every single spending back when I was running for president in 2020, which feels like another lifetime. Every single thing that I proposed spending on, uh, I also proposed to pay for and explained what would have to happen tax-wise in order to do it. And again, that's just those are the habits that I built as a mayor who had to do my budget in cash. So, look, it's not like it's a completely unsolvable problem. There are measures that we got to take to reduce things like the cost of providing healthcare, which is one of the biggest uh uh sources of pressure on uh Medicare, Medicaid, you name it. Not just getting people insured, but the actual underlying cost. Same with pharmaceuticals. And then there are things you got to do on the revenue side. Like I'm I'm sorry, but like we can't just slash a trillion bucks from from what the wealthiest people are paying again and again and then call this a sustainable budget.</p>

### 民主党内部的身份政治危机

**主持人：** 我们能谈谈民主党内部的运作吗？在 Kamala Harris 的回忆录中，她部分地指出你的身份是你未被考虑为她竞选伙伴的原因之一。你能向我们解释一下身份在民主党政治中的作用吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we go to the inner workings of the Democratic party. In Kla Harris's memoir, she points in part to your identity as a reason why you weren't considered as her running mate. Can you explain to us the role of identity in Democratic politics?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我希望身份在我们国家和我们党的政治中扮演一个不那么核心的角色。这不仅仅是因为我可能因为这个原因错过了一个机会，而是因为我认为它确实主导了太多人的思维，使得我们更难建立一个跨越不同身份的共同信息。别误会，我不是说假装身份不重要，或者假装色盲是合理的。我也不认为让身份来解释一切是合理的，这是我党极左翼形成的一种习惯，这让我们更难传达信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's just say I would love for identity to play a less central role uh in the politics of our country and and the politics of my party and and not just because I might have been passed over for uh for an opportunity, but just because I think it is it has really dominated so many people's thinking in a way that makes it harder for us to build a message across identities. I mean, don't get me wrong, I I don't think it I don't think it makes sense to pretend that identity doesn't matter. I don't think it makes sense to pretend to be colorblind. I also don't think it makes sense to allow that to explain everything, which is one of the habits that's formed, I think definitely on my party's far left, that that made it harder for us to get through.</p>
</details>

尤其当你有很多利益共享的人群时。我想到的是这个国家穷人和低收入人群的经济利益，他们有黑人、白人，以及各种族裔、身份和性别。他们可能没有听到一个统一的、对他们作为一个整体说话的信息，因为感觉我的党就像一个沙拉吧，这里给你的群体一点，那里给另一个群体一点，再给另一个群体一点，但这些加起来并没有构成一个完整的故事。现在，我认为特朗普也在搞一种身份政治，一种白人身份政治，让人们感觉自己被“他者”包围，移民是一种入侵。但更直接地回答你关于我党的问题，我认为身份在我党的思维中变得过于核心了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">especially when you have a lot of people whose interests are shared. I'm thinking about the economic interest of poor people and low-wealth people in this country, for example, who are black, white, and of of every ethnicity and identity and gender, of course, who maybe didn't hear a unifying message that was speaking to them as a group because it felt like my party was it was like a salad bar, like here's something for your group and here's something for another group and here's something for another group and it didn't add up into a story. Now, I would argue that Trump practices a kind of identity politics, too. a sort of a white identity politics that uh makes people feel like they are encircled by the other that that that immigrants are sort of an invasion. I mean, we can go down that road and I often have, but uh the more straightforward way to answer your question about my party is that I think identity has become too central to how my party thinks.</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">How do you navigate the the necessary extremism maybe that's required then to get out of a primary process?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 这是从初选到大选的经典问题，对吧？你被迫说一些话来吸引党内的基本盘，然后如果你不小心，你说的话会让你在大选中难以建立信誉，因为那时你试图描绘一幅尽可能多的人都能在其中看到自己的图景。这没什么新鲜的。但现在越来越多地发生的是，这种情况在越来越多的竞选中出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this is the classic issue with going from primaries to generals, right? you you are pressured to say one thing to appeal to the base in your party and then you wind up if if you're not careful saying things that make it hard for you to have credibility in a general election when you're trying to uh paint a picture that the broadest number of people possible can can see themselves in. That's nothing new. But one thing that has happened more and more and more is that that's happening in more and more races.</p>
</details>

我认为这对我们伤害最大的地方是在国会。众议院有 435 个席位。我上次查的时候，不到十分之一被认为是真正有竞争性的。这意味着在十分之九的竞选中，初选基本上就决定了一切。所以你根本不需要担心你在初选中采取的某个立场是否会让你更难跨党派合作，或者更难赢得人们的支持，因为这些选区被划分得如此不公（gerrymandered），你只需要担心你的右翼（如果你是共和党人）或你的左翼（如果你是民主党人）。我认为这是对我们伤害最大的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the presidency is always a little bit like this, but the presidency is also the one that gets painted in the broadest strokes because it's it's a campaign for the whole country and it's all the different jostling around all the issues and all the groups all boiled down into two people running for one office. But where I think this actually hurts us the most is in Congress. So we got 435 seats in the House. Last time I checked, less than one out of 10 of them is considered to be seriously competitive at best. like less than 40 are actually competitive, which means in nine out of 10 races, the primary is pretty much it. So, you never even have to bother thinking about whether some stance you took in the primary is going to make it harder for you to work across the aisle or or harder to win people over or bring them together in the general because these districts are so gerrymandered, right, that uh that all you have to worry about is your right flank if you're a Republican uh or your left flank if you're a Democrat. That's where I think it hurts us the most.</p>

<p class="english-text">And why do you think Biden looked the other way? What was the strategy? Was there a strategy?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 是的，我认为发生的情况是，他真的指望国会来做这件事。他出身国会，是国会的人，他认为国会可以达成两党共识。因为，你知道，美国人民实际上对该怎么做有两党共识，那就是大多数人相信的，我也相信的：让非法入境更难，让合法入境和获得合法身份更容易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think what happened was he was really looking to Congress to do it. He came out of Congress.

Which is what most people believe, what I believe, which is let's make it harder to come in illegally and easier to come in legally and and to get legal if you're not. I mean, that's where most people are most country.</p>
</details>

然而，上一次我们有真正的法案来解决这个问题还是在 80 年代。所以我认为他——这是我的猜测，我从未真正参与过移民方面的事情——觉得解决这个问题的办法是在国会把事情办成。他觉得他成功地通过了基础设施法案和《通胀削减法案》。但有趣的是，当他最终对国会放弃希望时，很明显我们不会有太大进展，与此同时，他在任期末发布的那套行政命令对非法越境人数产生了重大影响。所以你得问问自己，如果那个在任期末发布的行政命令在第一年或第二年就实施了，我们现在会不会处于一个不同的境地？

Um but what's interesting is when he finally gave up on Congress uh when it was clear that we just weren't going to get very far and meanwhile you had had that that exe set of executive orders that came late in the term that had a major effect on the number of illegal crossings. So you got to ask yourself if that executive order that happened toward the end if that had been done in year 1, year two, would we be in a different place?</p>

**主持人：** 澄清一下，Pete，如果由你决定，你会重新开放边境，还是会维持 Donald Trump 现在的立场，即“好了，现在关闭了，现在让我们来解决你所说的这个大交易”？

<p class="english-text">Just to clean this up, Pete, like if you if it were up to you, would you reopen the border or would you maintain the Donald Trump position right now of okay, now it's closed, now let's figure out this grand bargain, as you say, keep</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我们需要更精确地定义我们的意思。如果你的意思是让非法越境变得困难，至少和现在一样困难，我认为让非法越境变得困难是件好事。但同样，我认为称之为当时“开放”或现在“关闭”，你谈论的是很多不同且重叠的事情。显然，特朗普的移民政策中有很多我认为是错误的、破坏性的，也可能是非法的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">more precise by what we mean. I mean, if you mean like having it be difficult, at least as difficult as it is now, to cross illegally. I think that's it's a good thing for it to be difficult to cross illegally. Um, but again, I think calling it open then or closed now, you're talking about a lot of different overlapping things. Obviously, there are a lot of things about Trump's immigration policy I think are wrong, destructive, possibly illegal, too.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 阴谋论的说法是，拜登想让更多人进来，以建立民主党的基础，从而获得选民。这是特朗普这边的一种理论。现在，特朗普正在进行这些暴力的驱逐行动，花费大量资金。你认为特朗普为什么要这样做？

<details>

<p class="english-text">The conspiracy corner for Biden was he wanted to let a lot more people in in order to build the Democratic base in order to get voters. Okay, that's one theory. Now, the theory here is Trump is doing these violent deportations, tackling people, spending a lot of money while doing it. Um, why why is Trump doing it this way? Why does Pete think he's doing it this way?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我认为他依赖于恐惧政治。我认为混乱对他有利。我认为他靠混乱为生。当你看到人们被殴打的画面，或者他过去称之为“美国大屠杀”的景象，任何能证实这一点的事情——基本上，这个国家的感觉越糟糕，Donald Trump 的处境就越好，无论他是在竞选总统，还是作为总统向街头派遣军队。

<p class="english-text">I I think he thrives on a politics of fear. I think chaos is good for him. I think he thrives on chaos. Uh I think when you see images of uh people getting beaten up or you know what what he used to call American carnage like anything that validates that basically the worse it it's a weird thing but the worse it feels to be in this country the better off Donald Trump is whether he's running for president or whether he is president and sending troops marching into the streets.</p>

### 拜登政府的内部运作与认知能力争议

**主持人：** 我想了解一下你在拜登政府工作的经历是怎样的。我们看到了一系列爆料，Kamala Harris 的书，KJP 的书。上周我们请来了 Joe Manchin，他说的一件事是，不是 Joe Biden 变了，而是他的工作人员疯了，Ron Klain 实际上是一个守门人，如果你有合理的提议，它们会进入某个黑洞然后消失。你能给我们讲讲在拜登手下工作是什么样的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really want to get some insight into what it was like for you to work in the Biden administration. We've had the sea of tell alls coming out, Kla Harris's book, KJP's book. We had Joe Mansion on last week and one of the things that he said is that it was not that Joe Biden changed, but that the staff were nuts and that Ron Clay was effectively a gatekeeper and if you had reasonable proposals, they would go into some black hole and die. Can you give us a sense of what it was like to work under Biden and the the positives but also the negatives? Give us a fair representation.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 是的，本着公平的精神，我应该说这是我除了军队之外，唯一一次在联邦政府工作。所以我无法将一个白宫与另一个，或一个总统与另一个进行比较。但我会告诉你我的经历。他们有很高的抱负，试图迅速完成大事，尤其是在头两年，当时感觉有机会与国会两院合作来实现目标，包括投入大量精力与像 Joe Manchin 这样的人相处，以确保我们维系住那个联盟，来完成像基础设施法案这样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and in the spirit of fairness, I should say this is the only time I've outside of military, it's the only time I've ever worked in the federal government. So I can't benchmark, you know, to compare one white house to another or one president to another. But I'll tell you what my experience was like. There's a high level of ambition trying to get big things done quickly, especially in the first two years when there was uh felt like there was that opportunity to uh work with both houses of Congress to make it happen, including just a ton of energy going into well among other things spending time with folks like Joe Mansion trying to make sure that that we held together that that coalition to do things like the infrastructure law.</p>
</details>

有些决定我同意，有些我不同意。也有很多时候，看起来某件事不会发生，但不知何故它就发生了。我认为这得益于有一位在参议院待了那么久的总统。因为，你知道，基础设施法案当时真的感觉已经死了。我们现在忘了这一点，因为它发生了，很难想象会有其他方式，但在 2021 年夏天，它被宣布死亡很多次才最终完成。所以这些从失败边缘夺取胜利的时刻，“守门人”这个词经常被用来形容白宫工作人员。我不认为这不公平。但我也想说，这并不是什么新鲜事。守门人通常是幕僚长的别称。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um there were calls I agree with, there were calls I disagreed with. Um, there were also a lot of times when it looked like something wasn't going to happen and then somehow it happened. And that was where I I do think it helped to have a president who spent as much time as he did in the Senate because, you know, it really felt like the infrastructure bill was dead. We forget this now cuz cuz it happened and it's kind of hard to imagine it was any other way, but you know, it was proclaimed dead many, many times in that summer of 2021 before it got done. So these moments of snatching uh uh victory from the jaws of defeat, you know, the word gatekeeper gets used a lot for White House staff. I don't think that's unfair. I would also say though that I don't say that's new. Um you know, the gatekeeper is often the the kind of other word you use for a chief of staff.</p>

**主持人：** 他是否出现了认知能力下降？或者说，你第一次意识到他认知能力下降是什么时候？或者怀疑他不能胜任这份工作？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Was he into cognitive decline or when did you first realize he was in cognitive decline, I guess, would be the better question, or suspect that he wasn't, you know, up for the job.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 你能感觉到他在变老。我想我们都看到了。我的经验是，显然，我不是每天都在白宫。大部分时间我都在外地做交通方面的工作。但是，如果我在一个活动上，我看到的和你从电视上看到的没什么两样。我认为那场辩论是一个真正的转折点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could feel that he was growing older. I mean, I think we all saw that. Uh, I think my experience and obviously, you know, I wasn't at the White House every day. Most of the time I was I was out in the field doing transportation work. But, uh, you know, what I would see if I was at an event was the same as what you'd see, you know, watching TV. Um, I think the debate was a real turning point.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 像那样的事情是怎么发生的？一个认知能力如此衰退的人怎么会被推到那种境地？因为很明显，他们在几个月前就知道这不会有好结果。他们是怎么走到那一步的？他们有多封闭？然后我想谈谈在没有初选的情况下选择 Kamala 的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">something like that happen, h how does somebody who is so in cognitive decline get put up into that situation because it's clear that they knew many months before that this was not going to end well. How did they get to that point? How insular were they? And then I want to talk about the uh selection of Kamla without having a primary.</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 我想简单的答案是，并没有一个“他们”来做那个决定，对吧？人们会给建议，但只有一个“他”，一个人决定他是否再次竞选。最终，一个人决定竞选策略并为此负责。所以，我无法想象核心圈子里到底发生了什么。我没有参与那些对话，但我确实认为，到那场辩论的时候，情况已经非常清楚，那对他、对党都没有好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think the short answer is there there's not really a they that makes that decision, right? people give advice, but there's a he like one person decides if he's running again. One person decides at the end of the day on the campaign strategy and is accountable for that. Uh so, you know, I think I I can't imagine what exactly was going on in the inner circle. I wasn't I wasn't part of those conversations, but um yeah, I I do think that, you know, by the time it got to that debate, uh it was just very clear that it wasn't serving him well, wasn't serving the party well.</p>

### AI 时代的就业冲击与财富集中

**主持人：** 我们行业内一直在进行一场关于就业替代的大辩论。亚马逊昨天宣布将裁减 3 万个白领工作岗位。UPS 今天也宣布裁员约 4 万人。而且《纽约时报》有泄露消息称，亚马逊计划未来取消 60 万个工作岗位，不再招聘，因为他们坚信机器人技术将完成这些工作。我们都知道人工智能将是我们一生中最大的变革。问题是，这次的就业替代和新工作创造会是什么样子？Pete Buttigieg 是怎么想的？你认为我们面临一个严重的问题，还是你认为我们能够应对？当你是总统时，政府在其中扮演什么角色？如果你继承了这个混乱的 AI 就业替代潜力，会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've had a grand debate occurring in our industry about job displacement. Uh Amazon announced yesterday, I'm sure you saw 30,000 white collar jobs to be eliminated. UPS today something around 40,000 people and there was a leak in the New York Times that Amazon was planning on eliminating 600,000 job wrecks for the future and not hiring them because they're so convinced that robotics will do that. We all know AI is going to be the biggest change of our lifetime. I don't think that's the debate. The question is um what will job displacement and new job creation look like this time? What does Pete Buddhajed think? Do you think that we have a serious issue on our hands or do you think we'll be able to navigate it? And then what's the government's role in it when you're president? What will it look like if you inherit this chaotic AI job displacement potential?</p>
</details>

**Pete Buttigieg：** 是的，我对此非常担忧，部分原因是我在工业中西部长大。我在印第安纳州北部长大，那里有很多汽车行业的供应链公司。在 90 年代和 2000 年代，大量的贸易和自动化，但实际上主要是自动化进入了。每个人都被告知，不要太担心你今天做的事情，蛋糕会变得更大，每个人都会过得更好。问题是，蛋糕确实变大了，但承诺的其余部分没有实现。人们很生气。人们生气是因为他们失去了收入，但也因为即使他们通过培训项目在增长领域找到了另一份工作，那也不是他们认为的自己，与他们的身份认同感或归属感无关。然后你就会继续看到一种不仅是经济上的，而且是更深层次的错位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'm I'm seriously concerned about it and and part of that's from growing up in the industrial Midwest. Like, you know, we were told I grew up in Northern Indiana, uh, a lot of auto industry supply chain companies there. And in the 90s and 2000s, a lot of trade and automation, but the truth is mostly automation came in. And uh everybody was told, you know, don't worry too much about what you're doing today. The pie is going to get so much bigger that everybody will be better off. And the thing is, the pie did get bigger, but the rest of that promise didn't come true. And people were pissed. People were pissed because they lost their income, but also even after they got their income, if if they went through a training program and got another job in a field that was growing, but it wasn't who they thought they were, it wasn't connected to their their sense of identity or belonging, then you continue to have a displacement that's not just economic, but but but really deeper than that.</p>
</details>

我实际上认为，很多这种情况直接导致了你在本届政府和这个政治时刻看到的民粹主义和民族主义。真正困扰我的是，我认识的任何汽车工人或电工，他们的归属感和身份认同在很多方面都取决于他们是汽车工人或电工。而对于我认识的大多数白领工作者来说，情况更是如此。在法律、软件领域工作的人，或者你看看放射学领域正在发生的事情，仅仅举一个例子，医学领域因为人工智能正在发生真正的改变。随之而来的替代我认为是巨大的，我不认为我们做好了准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I actually think a lot of that kind of leads directly to the populism and the nationalism that you see in this administration and this in this political moment. So uh and the thing that really haunts me is you know as much as any auto worker or electrical worker I know like their sense of belonging and identity you know very much depends in many ways on being an autoworker or an electrical worker. That's even more true for most white collar workers. I know people who work in law or or software or you know um uh you know you see what's happening in radiology just to take one example what's happening in medicine that's really changing because of AI and the the displacement that could come with that I think is enormous and I don't think we're prepared.</p>
</details>

我不想玩预测游戏，说哪些事情会以什么顺序发生，但我认为很明显，它规模巨大，速度很快，正在到来，并且在加速。我最大的担忧是，如果我们已经处于一个财富和权力集中的水平，历史上没有任何一个共和国能幸存下来，那么这是否会成为一个让财富和权力更加集中在更少数人手中的发展？我不认为它必须如此。我认为这就是好的政策可以发挥作用的地方。但我认为，如果我们只是梦游般地走进去，那可能会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I don't know you know I don't want to get into prediction games about which things will happen in which order but I think it's clear that it's big. It's clear that it's fast. It's coming. It's accelerating. And my big worry is that if we're already at a level of concentration of wealth and power that no republic has ever survived, is this going to be a development that just makes wealth and power even more concentrated in even fewer hands? I don't think it has to be. I think that's where, you know, good policy can make a difference. But I think if we just sleepwalk into it, that could happen.</p>
