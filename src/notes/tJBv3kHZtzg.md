### 开场与嘉宾介绍

主持人: Okay. Uh, well, just wait for another minute and then I'll start. Uh, there's recording. So, uh, if you want to share this with your friend, uh, you probably just joined from Maven the Lightning course, you can just share that and uh, uh, we'll upload the recording and you can access get access to the recording that way.
主持人: 好的。嗯，我们再等一分钟就开始。嗯，有录音。所以，如果你想把这个分享给你的朋友，你可能刚从Maven的Lightning课程加入，你可以分享那个，我们会上传录音，这样你就可以访问录音了。

主持人: Yeah. How is everyone? So, uh, let's like where let's type in chat where are you from?
主持人: 大家好吗？那么，我们来聊聊，大家可以在聊天框里输入你们来自哪里？

主持人: I found that to be like an interesting engagement and because we have uh, a lot of stuff to cover and uh, uh, we have a large audience, so uh, I'll take uh, questions at the end.
主持人: 我觉得这是一个有趣的互动方式。因为我们有很多内容要讲，而且观众很多，所以我会把问题留到最后回答。

主持人: Um, you can just type your question uh, in chat or if you know how to do that, there is a Q&A function and you can type your question over there or just leave in chat and then I'll try to uh, I'll do my best to uh, cover those questions.
主持人: 嗯，你可以直接在聊天框里输入你的问题，或者如果你知道怎么操作，有一个问答功能，你可以在那里输入问题，或者直接留在聊天框里，然后我会尽力回答这些问题。

主持人: All right, let's start. Uh, Riley, you can take over and uh, start presenting.
主持人: 好的，我们开始吧。Riley，你可以接手并开始演示了。

Riley: Okay. Uh, okay, let me, uh, let me share my screen. Can you see it?
Riley: 好的。嗯，好的，我来，嗯，我来分享我的屏幕。你们能看到吗？

主持人: Yep. Yep.
主持人: 嗯，能。

Riley: Yep. Okay. So I know this uh, webinar is about like my experience about going to hackathons. So today I'm going to share my experience of going to all these hackathons. They actually boils down to like five key principles. So hopefully like um, after this you will feel more confident going to different **hackathons** (黑客马拉松: Hackathon，一种在短时间内集中开发项目的活动) and you will like squeeze the most value of all the events that you go to.
Riley: 好的。我知道这次网络研讨会是关于我参加黑客马拉松的经验。所以今天我将分享我参加这些黑客马拉松的经验，它们实际上归结为五个关键原则。希望在此之后，你们能更有信心参加不同的黑客马拉松，并能从所有参加的活动中榨取最大的价值。

Riley: Uh, okay. So a little bit about myself. Uh, I, I'm right now a **monetization product** (变现产品经理: 负责产品如何通过各种方式创收的经理) at Fortnite **Epic Games** (Epic Games: 一家美国电子游戏公司，以开发《堡垒之夜》和虚幻引擎闻名) and this is al also my little Red Node. Um, I post some things on Red Note too. I so my job is remote, so I mostly stayed in **Bay Area** (湾区: 旧金山湾区，美国加利福尼亚州北部的一个大都会区，以科技产业闻名) and you know like there's a lot of events going on Bay Area, so I usually go to hackathons with my friends and all the different events. Yeah.
Riley: 嗯，好的。简单介绍一下我自己。我现在是《堡垒之夜》Epic Games的变现产品经理，这也是我的小红书账号。嗯，我也会在小红书上发一些东西。我的工作是远程的，所以我大部分时间都待在湾区。你们知道，湾区有很多活动，所以我经常和朋友一起去参加黑客马拉松和各种活动。是的。

主持人: Um, is there anything else I should talk about myself like why are you talking about uh, successful hackathons? What is your achievements at different hackathons?
主持人: 嗯，我还需要谈谈我自己什么吗？比如你为什么要谈论成功的黑客马拉松？你在不同的黑客马拉松中取得了哪些成就？

Riley: Yeah. Um, I started going to hackathons maybe in 2023ish. Um, so I'm actually a pretty late starter on hackathons and um, I think in total I've been winging maybe around like um, 85k like credits plus cash. I just happened to find like I'm my wing rate of hackathon is like pretty high and I started posting like notes on retail and then I got a lot of questions. So um, we think it's it might be a good idea do a webinar and share with like what I've learned in different hackathons.
Riley: 是的。嗯，我大概在2023年左右开始参加黑客马拉松。嗯，所以我在黑客马拉松方面其实算是个比较晚的入门者。嗯，我想我总共赢得了大约8.5万美元的积分和现金。我只是偶然发现我在黑客马拉松中的胜率相当高，然后我开始在社交媒体上发布笔记，收到了很多问题。所以，我们觉得举办一个网络研讨会，分享我在不同黑客马拉松中学到的经验，可能是一个好主意。

主持人: And uh, most notably you won first place at two of the most competitive hackathons, right? the **YC** (Y Combinator: 全球知名创业加速器，以其严格的筛选和高成功率而闻名) and **OpenAI** (OpenAI: 一家美国人工智能研究公司，以开发ChatGPT等大型语言模型而闻名) hackathon.
主持人: 而且，最值得一提的是，你在两个最具竞争力的黑客马拉松中都获得了第一名，对吗？就是YC和OpenAI的黑客马拉松。

Riley: Yeah, there was like a **Cognition Hackathon** (Cognition 黑客马拉松: 由Cognition AI公司赞助的黑客马拉松) Cognition and Winsf, so we got the first place of that one, that one is also have like the highest the like the biggest prize pool that one single-handedly contributed 64k um, like credits and cash to my entire hackathon reward pool.
Riley: 是的，有一个Cognition黑客马拉松，还有Winsf，我们在那个比赛中获得了第一名，那个比赛的奖金池也是最大的，它单独为我整个黑客马拉松奖金池贡献了6.4万美元的积分和现金。

Riley: Yeah, we also got another one um, project is called **Oreo** (Oreo: 项目名称) in we actually got win kind of like two YC hackathon. The first one project is called **Showya.ai** (Showya.ai: 项目名称). That one got the third prize uh, the third place of the entire hackathon.
Riley: 是的，我们还赢得了另一个，项目名叫Oreo，我们实际上赢得了两次YC黑客马拉松。第一个项目叫Showya.ai。那个项目获得了整个黑客马拉松的第三名。

Riley: In the another YC hackathon, our project Oreo got um, the best use of **Convex** (Convex: 一个用于构建高性能、可扩展应用程序的后端平台) and the best use of **Vercel** (Vercel: 一个用于前端开发人员的平台，提供部署、托管和无服务器功能).
Riley: 在另一个YC黑客马拉松中，我们的项目Oreo获得了“最佳使用Convex”奖和“最佳使用Vercel”奖。

主持人: And uh, in addition to the you know the winning and the credits and the cash, you also got beating time with Andrew Capathy CEO at Warell. Uh, I don't know how to pronounce his name.
主持人: 而且，除了赢得奖金和现金，你还获得了与Warell的首席执行官Andrew Capathy共进午餐的机会。嗯，我不知道他的名字怎么发音。

Riley: Yeah. Uh, we got like um, yeah, it's it's interesting like not only do we get like cash and rewards, we also got a lot of meaningful networking out of those things.
Riley: 是的。嗯，我们获得了，嗯，是的，这很有趣，我们不仅获得了现金和奖励，还通过这些活动获得了许多有意义的人脉。

Riley: For example, in one one the first YC hackathon we got invited to launch with the wordware **CTO** (首席技术官: Chief Technology Officer，公司中负责技术战略和管理的高级管理人员) and then uh, we also like in the Cognition hackathon we got invited to the Cognition hacker house to have dinner with the entire team.
Riley: 例如，在第一次YC黑客马拉松中，我们受邀与Wordware的首席技术官共进午餐。然后，嗯，在Cognition黑客马拉松中，我们还受邀到Cognition黑客之家与整个团队共进晚餐。

Riley: Um, and then in the third hackathon, I think we got invited to a lot of Convex events. Uh, we got connected with the Vercel CEO. Uh, we also got invited um, to like a private chat with a **YC Partner** (YC 合伙人: Y Combinator的合伙人，负责指导和投资初创公司).
Riley: 嗯，然后在第三次黑客马拉松中，我想我们受邀参加了许多Convex的活动。嗯，我们与Vercel的首席执行官建立了联系。嗯，我们还受邀与一位YC合伙人进行了一次私人聊天。

主持人: Nice. Let's start.
主持人: 很好。我们开始吧。

Riley: Yeah. Okay. Um, so here let me just do a little bit demo because this is I'm very proud of this project. It's a working demo. This is the project I was talking about that won the first place of um, the Wingsurf and Cognition hackathon. It's called **Over Easy** (Over Easy: 项目名称).
Riley: 是的。好的。嗯，所以这里我先做个小演示，因为我对这个项目非常自豪。这是一个可运行的演示。这就是我刚才提到的，在Wingsurf和Cognition黑客马拉松中获得第一名的项目。它叫Over Easy。

### 冠军项目“Over Easy”演示

Riley: So I will give this demo as in a very similar way that how we give this demo and the the final presentation in the hackathon. So you will have like if so for those who have never been to a hackathon, you will have an idea of how um, the final presentation at least what it looks like for us.
Riley: 所以我将以与我们在黑客马拉松决赛演示中非常相似的方式进行这个演示。这样，对于那些从未参加过黑客马拉松的人来说，你们就能了解至少我们是如何进行最终演示的。

Riley: So Over Easy is a **vibe hacking agent** (漏洞检测代理: 一种自动化工具，用于识别和评估软件或系统中的安全漏洞) that we build to help people evaluate if they're viodated apps are um, are secure or not.
Riley: Over Easy是一个漏洞检测代理，我们构建它来帮助人们评估他们的应用程序是否安全。

Riley: So all of things you can see are built in seven hours in the hackathon on the spot. Um, and then after that we did a little bit deployment to make it a little better, but I would say 95% is the same including that like killed killed animation.
Riley: 所以你们看到的所有东西都是在黑客马拉松现场的七小时内构建的。嗯，之后我们做了一些部署让它变得更好一点，但我想说95%都是一样的，包括那个很棒的动画。

Riley: So to use this um, you start a new test run, you put in a website URL that you want to test. So here I just picked a lovable project um, and then you follow the instructions.
Riley: 那么要使用这个，嗯，你开始一个新的测试运行，输入你想要测试的网站URL。所以这里我只是选择了一个很受欢迎的项目，嗯，然后你按照说明操作。

Riley: You would do some um, activities on the website and in the end you can paste the logs here to help the agents um, kind of like do its job.
Riley: 你会在网站上进行一些活动，最后你可以把日志粘贴到这里，帮助代理，嗯，完成它的工作。

Riley: So for time purpose, I'm not going to do the entire demo, uh, but I will show you like the result of some previous runs that we did.
Riley: 所以为了节省时间，我不会进行完整的演示，嗯，但我会向你们展示我们之前一些运行的结果。

Riley: So you can see um, so how this works is that we have a very simple agent that's going through all the **APIs** (应用程序编程接口: Application Programming Interface，定义了软件组件如何相互交互的一组规则) that you paste into it.
Riley: 所以你们可以看到，嗯，它的工作原理是，我们有一个非常简单的代理，它会遍历你粘贴进去的所有API。

Riley: It will just keep go through every API endpoint and see if it can find any loopholes and in the end it will summarize the results here.
Riley: 它会不断地遍历每个API端点，看看是否能找到任何漏洞，最后它会在这里总结结果。

Riley: The **UI** (用户界面: User Interface，用户与软件或系统交互的界面) is not perfect. We try our best. It's like a very short limited time. But you can see it finds some very high critical uh, loopholes.
Riley: 用户界面并不完美。我们尽力了。时间非常短。但你们可以看到它发现了一些非常高危的漏洞。

Riley: First is anyone can read all private messages from all users. So if we go to the one of the network request um, calls, you can see the results.
Riley: 首先是任何人都可以读取所有用户的私人消息。所以如果我们查看其中一个网络请求，嗯，调用，你们可以看到结果。

Riley: It's actually like all the messages of the users from this um, lovable app that was very popular a couple weeks ago. It says chat burn and finish. So it's supposed to destroy all the messages that you send, but it actually didn't.
Riley: 它实际上是来自这个几周前非常流行的，嗯，受欢迎的应用程序的所有用户消息。它说聊天会焚毁并结束。所以它应该销毁你发送的所有消息，但实际上并没有。

Riley: Uh, you can see like people are saying all this weird stuff like on the website that they're not supposed to be exposed. So yeah, and then we also built like a share page to help people share this with um, like other friends. You see like we run some examples there. So that's the example uh, that's what Over Easy looks like for the um, for our demo there.
Riley: 嗯，你们可以看到人们在网站上说这些不应该被曝光的奇怪内容。所以是的，然后我们还建立了一个分享页面，帮助人们与，嗯，其他朋友分享这个。你们看，我们运行了一些示例。所以这就是示例，嗯，这就是Over Easy在我们的演示中的样子。

主持人: And now we can I guess um, do you have any questions for the demo where I can talk a little bit more on like what are hackathons?
主持人: 那么现在我想，嗯，你们对演示有什么问题吗？或者我可以多谈谈什么是黑客马拉松？

主持人: Let's talk about uh, continue. I'll interrupt to you if you have question.
主持人: 我们继续说吧。如果你有问题，我会打断你。

### 什么是黑客马拉松？

Riley: Sounds good. So I know um, many people like you must have heard about hackathons. That's why you sign up for this um, class and then you think it's very interesting but maybe not a lot of people have been to hackathons.
Riley: 听起来不错。我知道，嗯，很多人肯定都听说过黑客马拉松。这就是你们报名参加这个，嗯，课程的原因，你们觉得它很有趣，但可能很多人并没有真正参加过黑客马拉松。

Riley: So um, I will introduce a little bit like what hackathons are. Um, so it's actually a very interesting term like hack plus marathon. I believe it's born out of some internal events in Yahoo where like all the engineers get together like spend a lot of time non break to build some very challenging engineering task and as time went by it evolves into an event.
Riley: 所以，嗯，我来简单介绍一下黑客马拉松是什么。嗯，它实际上是一个非常有趣的词，由“hack”加上“marathon”组成。我相信它起源于雅虎的一些内部活动，当时所有的工程师会聚在一起，不间断地花费大量时间来完成一些非常有挑战性的工程任务，随着时间的推移，它演变成了一种活动。

Riley: Um, in the early days it was mostly for students and they would go to this event build some project on the spot maybe like 48 hours non-stop and then uh, the judges will compete the final results on like which project is the best and then after a few years like maybe since 2023 when **ChatGPT** (ChatGPT: 一种由OpenAI开发的人工智能聊天机器人，能够生成类似人类的文本回应) gets like really popular, um, there are a lot of AI tools that's like born out of nowhere.
Riley: 嗯，早期它主要是针对学生的，他们会参加这个活动，在现场构建一些项目，可能不间断地进行48小时，然后，嗯，评委们会根据哪个项目最好来评判最终结果。然后几年后，大概从2023年ChatGPT变得非常流行开始，嗯，突然出现了许多AI工具。

Riley: There are a lot of companies start sponsoring more hackathons to try to encourage people build and try different AI tools. That's why I would say like after Tai GBD gets popular, we see more and more of this hackathons and it's also changed a little bit from like in the past it's more focused on engineering skill set more for students and now it's like more working people are participating in hackathons and it's not that um, engineering focused anymore.
Riley: 许多公司开始赞助更多的黑客马拉松，试图鼓励人们构建和尝试不同的AI工具。这就是为什么我想说，在ChatGPT流行之后，我们看到了越来越多的黑客马拉松，而且它也发生了一些变化，比如过去它更侧重于工程技能，更多是为学生举办，而现在更多是职场人士参与黑客马拉松，而且它不再那么，嗯，以工程为中心了。

Riley: Um, yeah, so which means like there's a lot of vibe coding things you don't have to really know a lot of coding to participate in hackathons and usually the way hackathon works is that um, there will be a like a host um, there will be a theme and then there will be a lot of sponsors the uh, the sponsors will like put in money putting price and uh, there are some requirements whether you have to use their tools or not and then for participants.
Riley: 嗯，是的，这意味着有很多类似快速编码的东西，你不需要真正了解很多编程知识就能参加黑客马拉松。通常黑客马拉松的运作方式是，嗯，会有一个主持人，嗯，会有一个主题，然后会有很多赞助商，嗯，赞助商会投入资金设置奖品，而且，嗯，会有一些要求，比如你是否必须使用他们的工具，然后就是参与者。

Riley: And uh, people go in teams or you can go in solo and they have to build something in within like a certain time. It's usually like five to seven hours for a short one. Some of the hackathons can go like overnights like two days or even 3 days.
Riley: 而且，嗯，人们可以组队参加，也可以单独参加，他们必须在一定时间内构建一些东西。短期的通常是五到七个小时。有些黑客马拉松可以持续过夜，比如两天甚至三天。

Riley: So I'm talking mostly about in-person hackathons. Um, yeah, like virtual hackathons is like another thing. It's more like just like competition.
Riley: 所以我主要谈论的是线下黑客马拉松。嗯，是的，线上黑客马拉松是另一回事。它更像是一种纯粹的比赛。

Riley: So in person hackathons it's usually like people go in teams build something within certain time periods and you submit your project and the judges and the sponsors will judge that like on the spot and then reveal the results. Who are the winner? Um, what are the winners of different tracks and that's like usually the event.
Riley: 所以线下黑客马拉松通常是人们组队在特定时间内构建一些东西，然后你提交你的项目，评委和赞助商会在现场进行评判，然后公布结果。谁是赢家？嗯，不同赛道的赢家是谁？这通常就是活动的流程。

### 黑客马拉松成功的五大关键原则

Riley: Yeah. Um, so I'm gonna next I'm going to talk about like the I'm gonna go dive into the like everything that people are most interested about which is like the five key principles that I personally find very useful with like all the hackathons that I go to.
Riley: 是的。嗯，所以接下来我将谈论，我将深入探讨人们最感兴趣的一切，那就是我个人认为在所有我参加的黑客马拉松中都非常实用的五个关键原则。

Riley: So um, I see hackathons like the backbone of a good hackathon project is just idea plus execution. So the first principle is about how to what is a good idea and how to get there.
Riley: 所以，嗯，我认为黑客马拉松中一个好的项目，其支柱就是创意加上执行。所以第一个原则是关于什么是一个好点子以及如何获得它。

Riley: So people keep saying things like oh, this is really cool this is like such a cool project. So what are the aspects of that makes a cool project?
Riley: 所以人们总是说“哦，这真的很酷，这是一个多么棒的项目啊”。那么，一个很酷的项目有哪些方面呢？

Riley: Um, I think there are two aspect of that's making an idea really good. One is how useful it is. You can if you can make the judges or the audience look at this and their eyes light up and they say oh, that's something I will use that actually solves my problem that's a very good standard of useful and the other aspect is about how different it is like how innovative it is.
Riley: 嗯，我认为一个好点子有两个方面。一个是它的实用性。如果你能让评委或观众看到它时眼前一亮，然后说“哦，这是我会用的东西，它确实解决了我的问题”，那这就是一个非常好的实用标准。另一方面是它的独特性，比如它有多创新。

Riley: Did it did it use something new? Did it use some tools in a very like in a way that no one has used it before? Is it like um, realization of a philosophical ideas that people thought about it but no one has actually built it?
Riley: 它是否使用了新东西？它是否以一种前所未有的方式使用了某些工具？它是否是，嗯，人们思考过但从未真正构建过的哲学思想的实现？

Riley: So our project Showya was a good example. It was not very useful. It was using **LLM** (大型语言模型: Large Language Model，一种基于深度学习的AI模型，能够理解和生成人类语言) as complete interpreter. Um, so there's no code. You use LLM to understand every interaction the user did.
Riley: 所以我们的项目Showya就是一个很好的例子。它不是很实用。它使用大型语言模型作为完整的解释器。嗯，所以没有代码。你使用大型语言模型来理解用户所做的每一个交互。

Riley: So it's a highly philosophical experiment that we did. A lot of people have similar ideas but no one has ever built it. So when people go to hackathons, they see this project they really like it.
Riley: 所以这是我们做的一个高度哲学性的实验。很多人都有类似的想法，但没有人真正构建过它。所以当人们参加黑客马拉松时，他们看到这个项目，他们真的很喜欢。

Riley: But it's not very useful because every time you click on the application it takes almost like one minute um, to react and do something.
Riley: 但它不是很实用，因为每次你点击应用程序时，它几乎需要一分钟的时间，嗯，才能做出反应并执行操作。

Riley: And on the contrary, the Over Easy hacking agent that you just see is a very useful one because everyone is vibe coding the website. No one really knows how secure they are.
Riley: 相反，你们刚刚看到的Over Easy漏洞检测代理就非常实用，因为每个人都在快速编写网站代码。没有人真正知道他们的网站有多安全。

Riley: So that's something when we show the demo, everyone is like, "Oh, that's such an interesting project. You should open it to public. Um, like I bet like my company will use it. Like I really need it."
Riley: 所以当我们展示演示时，每个人都会说：“哦，这真是一个有趣的项目。你们应该向公众开放。嗯，我敢打赌我的公司会用它。我真的需要它。”

Riley: So there's like a two elements of a cool idea. I would say like in different hackathons people might focus on different things like sometimes you might find the judges and audience like the practical aspect of the idea more sometimes people are just looking for like really cool things they've never seen before.
Riley: 所以一个很酷的点子有两个要素。我想说，在不同的黑客马拉松中，人们可能会关注不同的东西，比如有时你可能会发现评委和观众更喜欢点子的实用性，有时人们只是在寻找他们从未见过的真正酷的东西。

Riley: So, it's a little bit of a art and balance of like how do you want to balance this two things and there's also like some randomness like you never really know what a judge is like and you might never know what kind of good network it will get you by doing different ideas.
Riley: 所以，这有点像一门艺术和平衡，你如何平衡这两件事，而且还有一些随机性，比如你永远不知道评委喜欢什么，你可能永远不知道通过不同的想法会给你带来什么样的人脉。

Riley: So, how to get a good idea? It's not I would say like it's not easy. Um, I a lot of times but my personal experiences brainstorming ideas on the spot doesn't really quite work.
Riley: 那么，如何获得一个好点子呢？我想说，这并不容易。嗯，很多时候，根据我的个人经验，现场头脑风暴点子并不太奏效。

Riley: So usually all the ideas that's been working really well for us are the ideas we've been thinking a lot. For example, Over Easy is born out of the idea that was helping with my friend's um, bibec coding agent and we're comparing the security level of all this different bi coding tool platform like base 44 lovable replet agent and then we found so many loopholes by manually doing things then I was like oh, can we just build some agent that will help us to test the security of all this um, websites so I don't have to manually do it and Then everyone really likes the idea.
Riley: 所以通常对我们来说非常奏效的点子，都是我们已经思考了很久的点子。例如，Over Easy这个点子，最初是为了帮助我朋友的快速编码代理，我们当时正在比较所有这些不同的快速编码工具平台（比如Base 44、Lovable Replit Agent）的安全级别，然后我们通过手动操作发现了许多漏洞。于是我就想，哦，我们能不能构建一个代理来帮助我们测试所有这些网站的安全性，这样我就不用手动操作了。然后每个人都非常喜欢这个想法。

Riley: So we decided to build it out at a as a hackathon project. And the other one like the Showya, the philosophical LMS interpreter idea is also something my friend has been passionate.
Riley: 所以我们决定把它作为一个黑客马拉松项目来构建。而另一个，比如Showya，那个哲学性的LMS解释器想法，也是我朋友一直很热衷的。

Riley: I've been thinking about it for weeks and so he really wants to try to build it out in a hackathon. So it's I would say it boils down to it's something that you experience daily and then you're trying to solve your problem like a daily problem you've been experiencing it thinking about it for a while or something you're very obsessed or passionate about like you really want to try and build it.
Riley: 我已经思考了好几周，所以他真的很想在黑客马拉松中把它构建出来。所以我想说，它归结为：要么是你日常生活中遇到的问题，你一直在思考并试图解决它；要么是你非常痴迷或热衷的事情，你真的想尝试去构建它。

Riley: Usually those ideas work pretty well. So but not like we don't really have those ideas all the time. like what if you just don't have those ideas?
Riley: 通常这些点子效果都很好。但我们并不是总能有这些点子。比如，如果你就是没有这些点子怎么办？

Riley: One way if you like if you don't go with ideas is totally fine too. Um, when you're teaming up with people and you're like brainstorming, one very useful angle is to try to dig into their experience and ask questions about or do you have all this like everyday problems that you want to solve or do you have this thing that you're very obsessed or passionate about?
Riley: 一种方法是，如果你没有点子，那也完全没问题。嗯，当你和别人组队进行头脑风暴时，一个非常有用的角度是深入挖掘他们的经验，问他们是否有想要解决的日常问题，或者是否有他们非常痴迷或热衷的事情？

Riley: Can we build something for for those two things? So, it's like digging into your teammates's personal experience.
Riley: 我们能不能为这两件事构建一些东西？所以，这就像深入挖掘你队友的个人经验。

Riley: So, we we saw a project that was doing really well, which is um, they have like a community school like a like I forgot what she works for, but she works for a community school.
Riley: 所以，我们看到了一个做得非常好的项目，嗯，他们有一个社区学校，我忘了她具体是做什么的，但她在一个社区学校工作。

Riley: So, she keeps seeing all these people suffering from like not being able to um, pick the courses in community school. So they built a little tool to help her students to better do that.
Riley: 所以，她一直看到很多人因为无法，嗯，在社区学校选课而苦恼。所以他们构建了一个小工具来帮助她的学生更好地完成这件事。

Riley: It's not something that we usually experience every day, but it's like her everyday life and she is like very passionate about this topic. She knows all the user problem and their project end up doing pretty well.
Riley: 这不是我们日常生活中经常遇到的问题，但却是她日常生活的一部分，而且她对这个话题非常热衷。她了解所有的用户问题，他们的项目最终也做得相当不错。

Riley: So that's how you can get the good idea either from your own personal experience or dig into other people's personal experience.
Riley: 所以这就是你如何获得好点子的方法，要么来自你自己的个人经验，要么深入挖掘他人的个人经验。

### 以演示为核心的执行力

Riley: Yeah. And then um, the next part um, is about execution. I talk about hackathon is about idea plus execution. You if you have a really good idea but you can't really build anything. That's not the point of hackathon.
Riley: 是的。然后，嗯，下一部分，嗯，是关于执行力。我说黑客马拉松是关于创意加上执行。如果你有一个非常好的点子，但你却无法真正构建出任何东西，那这不是黑客马拉松的重点。

Riley: The hackathon is a little bit like a because it's like a marathon. It's a little bit like a sports. But something different is like for other sports you do the practice like like everything happened um, before that competition but for hackathon a lot of things will have to happen on the spot.
Riley: 黑客马拉松有点像，因为它像一场马拉松。它有点像一项运动。但不同之处在于，对于其他运动，你会在比赛前进行练习，嗯，所有事情都发生在比赛之前，但对于黑客马拉松，很多事情都必须在现场发生。

Riley: It's like um, like a building thing. So you have to show something. It's one funny example is that in one of the um, the hackathon final presentation there's a team doing something really cool but they don't actually have anything that they can demo.
Riley: 它就像，嗯，一个构建活动。所以你必须展示一些东西。一个有趣的例子是，在一次，嗯，黑客马拉松的最终演示中，有一个团队做了一些非常酷的事情，但他们实际上没有任何可以演示的东西。

Riley: There's no visual, no demo, like nothing at all. They just have like this idea and this backend API that's kind of working. So like even if the idea is really good, the judges just like can't really give them a very high score or like a good result because that's not really presentable.
Riley: 没有视觉效果，没有演示，什么都没有。他们只有一个点子和一个勉强能用的后端API。所以即使点子再好，评委也无法给他们很高的分数或好的结果，因为它根本无法展示。

Riley: So one strategy that I find really helpful is to always think about the demo. Like think about what do you want to show to people?
Riley: 所以我发现一个非常有用的策略是始终考虑演示。比如，你想向人们展示什么？

Riley: Like everyone understands six or seven hours even two days are not enough to build a completely working product and so it's important to pick and choose your battle like how do you want to show this thing?
Riley: 就像每个人都明白，六七个小时甚至两天都不足以构建一个完全可用的产品，所以选择你的“战场”很重要，比如你想如何展示这个东西？

Riley: What should this three-minute demo look like? Um, after the user log in what should the user do and how do you want to like tell the story and emphasize your point.
Riley: 这个三分钟的演示应该是什么样子？嗯，用户登录后应该做什么，以及你如何讲述故事并强调你的观点。

Riley: Um, for example, in the Over Easy demo, we like we when we thought about the what should the demo look like with we think that it should expose the vulnerabilities of the website that it's able to find.
Riley: 嗯，例如，在Over Easy的演示中，我们思考演示应该是什么样子时，我们认为它应该揭示它能发现的网站漏洞。

Riley: So, it's just as simple as that because you can have all kinds of different approaches to do a little hacking agent. But by think aligning on what a demo should look like, everyone is more targeted on, oh, do we need this front end? Do we need this page? Do we need this API?
Riley: 所以，就这么简单，因为你可以有各种不同的方法来做一个小的漏洞检测代理。但是通过思考并确定演示应该是什么样子，每个人都会更明确目标，比如，我们需要这个前端吗？我们需要这个页面吗？我们需要这个API吗？

Riley: Then like everything is for that demo because in the end, even if the product didn't quite work by the end, if the demo works, it's like a working product to everyone.
Riley: 那么一切都是为了那个演示，因为最终，即使产品到最后没有完全奏效，如果演示成功了，对每个人来说，它就像一个可用的产品。

Riley: Yeah. And yeah, that's like the execution part. So the idea and the execution is like what makes a successful hackathon project.
Riley: 是的。是的，这就是执行部分。所以创意和执行是成就一个成功的黑客马拉松项目的关键。

Riley: I personally don't really like slides for final presentation. I don't think I ever made any deck for final presentation. I'm always just go in with um, a demo.
Riley: 我个人不太喜欢用幻灯片做最终演示。我想我从来没有为最终演示制作过任何演示文稿。我总是只带着，嗯，一个演示去。

主持人: But you kind of stage the live demo, right? Yes.
主持人: 但你有点像是在排练现场演示，对吧？是的。

Riley: Yes, we we definitely staged a little bit the demo like in like something might not work. So you practice the demo to make sure like the dummy data works, the flow works. It's it should be like a kind of like a performance of how the idea should look like. Yeah.
Riley: 是的，我们确实对演示进行了一些排练，比如有些东西可能无法正常工作。所以你要练习演示，确保模拟数据有效，流程顺畅。它应该像是一种表演，展示这个想法应该是什么样子。是的。

主持人: Nice.
主持人: 很好。

### 高效的团队协作

Riley: Yep. Um, so the the third point is like how to how do we make that idea plus execution combo work? So a lot of people ask me how do they find a teammate?
Riley: 是的。嗯，所以第三点是，我们如何让创意加上执行的组合奏效？很多人问我如何找到队友？

Riley: Um, like I have the privilege of knowing a lot of really good people. Like they're my friends and I see hackathon as a way like I also I personally really like hang out with my friends by building projects. So it just happened to be a way that I hang out with all the all the people and the way I make new friends is also I will ask oh, do you want to do a hackathon together?
Riley: 嗯，我很有幸认识很多非常优秀的人。他们是我的朋友，我把黑客马拉松看作是一种方式，我个人也很喜欢通过构建项目来和朋友们一起玩。所以它恰好成为我与所有人一起玩的方式，我结交新朋友的方式也是我会问：“哦，你想一起参加黑客马拉松吗？”

Riley: And so yeah, like um, I would say it's like very interesting to do projects with your friends. You learn a lot. Like you also go through a lot of things. I really like it.
Riley: 所以是的，嗯，我想说和朋友一起做项目非常有趣。你学到很多东西。你也会经历很多事情。我真的很喜欢。

Riley: But if you don't really have friends in real life that you can do it and you kind of have to find them on the spot, it's always like um, like a crapshoot. Like you don't you don't really know what kind of people you would get.
Riley: 但如果你现实生活中没有可以一起做项目的朋友，而你又必须在现场找人，那总是有点像，嗯，碰运气。你真的不知道你会遇到什么样的人。

Riley: Um, so like like it's just like hard to always get the best people on the spot. I would if you want to win the hackathon, I would suggest like going people you kind of know already, especially like uh, people should have different skill sets.
Riley: 嗯，所以，就像在现场总是很难找到最优秀的人。如果你想赢得黑客马拉松，我建议找你已经认识的人，特别是，嗯，人们应该拥有不同的技能组合。

Riley: I'm actually not um, believer of like huge team like in all the winning hackathons our team usually just have like two people like me and plus my engineering friend.
Riley: 我其实不相信大团队，比如在所有赢得比赛的黑客马拉松中，我们的团队通常只有两个人，比如我和我的工程师朋友。

Riley: So my friend will work on all the engineering stuff and I will work on all the non-engineering stuff including um, like like all the design you see like the egg thing like the animation there's also a lot of logistics there's like a lot of design how do we face the demo and including some networking with people and judges.
Riley: 所以我的朋友会负责所有的工程方面的工作，而我则负责所有非工程方面的工作，包括，嗯，比如你们看到的所有设计，比如那个蛋的动画，还有很多后勤工作，还有很多设计，比如我们如何面对演示，以及与人们和评委进行一些人脉建立。

Riley: Um, so I got a lot of questions about people asking me oh, I'm non-technical like what should I do in a hack hackathon like is that for me like if I don't know how to code can I go um, the like the answer is for sure especially when AI is so popular you don't really need to know how to code to participate in a hackathon.
Riley: 嗯，所以我收到了很多问题，人们问我：“哦，我是非技术人员，我在黑客马拉松中应该做什么？这适合我吗？如果我不会编程，我能去吗？”嗯，答案是肯定的，尤其是在AI如此流行的时候，你真的不需要会编程就能参加黑客马拉松。

Riley: In fact, I think a team I don't think a team can like at least for my personal uh, opinion I don't know how well if two engineers are working on the same team.
Riley: 事实上，我认为一个团队，至少在我个人，嗯，看来，我不知道如果两个工程师在同一个团队里工作会怎么样。

Riley: I usually talk to people um, a A lot of the frustration is that when you have two engineering two engineer work on the same codebase, you spend the majority of your time resolving merging conflict and especially when time is so tight like if like any little thing doesn't work, you spend too much time on like communicating.
Riley: 我通常会和人们交流，嗯，很多挫败感在于，当你有两个工程师在同一个代码库上工作时，你大部分时间都在解决合并冲突，尤其是在时间如此紧张的情况下，比如任何一点小问题没有解决，你都会花费太多时间在沟通上。

Riley: So if you have one really good engineer that usually works way better than if you have like two engineer try to work with each other unless you can divide and conquer the stuff really really well.
Riley: 所以如果你有一个非常优秀的工程师，通常比你有两个工程师试图互相协作要好得多，除非你能非常非常好地分工合作。

Riley: So to make sure you can maximize everyone's productivity but for non-engineering people it's actually a lot easier like there are like so many things you can do um, like people can think about the demo idea the user journey you can do design you can do like different art asset on the part uh, you can talk to people you can even like interview other people on the hackathon to get some user feedback interview the judges.
Riley: 所以为了确保你能最大化每个人的生产力，但对于非工程人员来说，实际上要容易得多，比如你可以做很多事情，嗯，比如人们可以思考演示创意、用户旅程，你可以做设计，你可以制作不同的艺术素材，嗯，你可以和人们交流，你甚至可以在黑客马拉松上采访其他人以获取用户反馈，采访评委。

Riley: But in the end I I think an ideal size is maybe like two to three people. Uh, because the more people you have the more you need to put in like communication and dividing up the work.
Riley: 但最终，我认为理想的团队规模可能是两到三个人。嗯，因为人越多，你就需要投入越多的沟通和工作分配。

Riley: So it's not always like the more people the better but of course the more people you have you can have like spread them out in different area depending on how complicated your project is.
Riley: 所以并不是人越多越好，但当然，人越多，你可以根据项目的复杂程度将他们分散到不同的领域。

Riley: But I think the it boils down to like if you are non-technical like it's totally fine like it's very fun to go into the hackathon because you actually get to have more fun meeting new people and engineering when engineering has to like always like heads down coding you can actually like do a lot of more stuff.
Riley: 但我认为归结起来就是，如果你是非技术人员，那完全没问题，参加黑客马拉松会非常有趣，因为你实际上可以更开心地结识新朋友，而工程师在必须埋头编码时，你实际上可以做更多的事情。

### 建立有效的人脉网络

Riley: Um, yeah, so I talk a little bit about networking. Um, so like networking hackathon I think it's not a topic that people like talk about a lot but I find it like very very useful uh, both for my personal goal which is to make more friends and like discover more interesting stuff happening in life and it's also about winning the hackathon.
Riley: 嗯，是的，我稍微谈一下人脉网络。嗯，所以，我认为黑客马拉松中的人脉网络并不是一个人们经常谈论的话题，但我发现它非常非常有用，嗯，无论是为了我个人的目标，即结交更多朋友和发现生活中更多有趣的事情，还是为了赢得黑客马拉松。

Riley: So for some so more let's be more utilitarian if you want to wing the um, hackathon it's more like the judges will have the final say in in your final project and if the judges don't get a lot of time like they don't like there are so many project the over easy one had like 100 I think the YC one always have maybe like 200 projects at the same time the judges just don't get that much time understanding your project or Like maybe you have a lot of really great ideas, but it's just hard to say everything in the 3 minutes demo and what if your demo doesn't work?
Riley: 所以，对于某些情况，如果我们更功利一点，如果你想赢得黑客马拉松，那更像是评委对你的最终项目拥有最终决定权。如果评委没有很多时间，比如他们不喜欢，或者项目太多了，Over Easy那个项目有大约100个，我想YC的黑客马拉松通常有大约200个项目同时进行，评委根本没有那么多时间来理解你的项目，或者你可能有很多非常棒的点子，但很难在3分钟的演示中说清楚所有事情，如果你的演示不成功怎么办？

Riley: So, there's a lot of things going on. If you can get any time talking to the judges during the hackathon um, get their feedback on your project, get their advice like it's it's a great way to kind of get more um, exposure for yourself and also for the judges to understand your project more in case India maybe they don't even get to see your project in the final judging because they always like spread it out.
Riley: 所以，有很多事情正在发生。如果你能在黑客马拉松期间与评委交谈，嗯，获得他们对你项目的反馈，获得他们的建议，这是一种很好的方式，可以为自己获得更多的曝光，也让评委更好地理解你的项目，以防万一，也许他们在最终评审中甚至没有看到你的项目，因为他们总是会分散评审。

主持人: Sorry question like are they at the hackathon or do they just come at the end to uh, to the judge and are they allowed to talk to participants?
主持人: 抱歉，有个问题，他们是在黑客马拉松现场吗？还是只在最后来，嗯，进行评判，他们被允许与参与者交谈吗？

Riley: Yeah. So um, for all the hackathons I went to only one very weird structured hackathon said oh, we don't want you to talk to the judge because it's not fair.
Riley: 是的。所以，嗯，在我参加过的所有黑客马拉松中，只有一个结构非常奇怪的黑客马拉松说：“哦，我们不希望你和评委交谈，因为那不公平。”

Riley: But most of the time the sponsors and judges uh, especially the sponsors which are also the judges at the same time they are there to talk to all the participants.
Riley: 但大多数时候，赞助商和评委，嗯，特别是那些同时也是评委的赞助商，他们都在那里与所有参与者交谈。

Riley: So um, in that case like everyone is encouraged to talk to them to learn about their company to ask questions about how to use their company tool in your project. So I would say like it's mostly encouraged to talk to them and um, yeah, that's for like utilitarian reason and but another thing I also find it's just like very interesting to talk to them.
Riley: 所以，嗯，在这种情况下，每个人都被鼓励与他们交谈，了解他们的公司，询问如何在你的项目中使用他们公司的工具。所以我想说，与他们交谈大多是受到鼓励的，嗯，是的，这是出于功利的原因，但另一方面，我也觉得与他们交谈非常有趣。

Riley: You can talk to judges and sponsors. You can talk to your fellow other hackers. Maybe when you're getting food, when you're getting drinks, just asking, "Oh, what are you building here?"
Riley: 你可以和评委、赞助商交谈。你可以和你的其他黑客同伴交谈。也许当你去拿食物、拿饮料的时候，就问一句：“哦，你在这里在做什么？”

Riley: Um, like you will miss I met a lot of my really good friends during hackathon. And it's like it's very hard to meet new friends. I will say like these days and you don't really have you don't always have something like interesting you can talk about.
Riley: 嗯，你可能会错过，我在黑客马拉松期间认识了很多非常好的朋友。而且，我想说，现在结识新朋友非常困难，你并不总是能找到有趣的话题来聊。

Riley: But in hackathon, everyone is here to try to build something. Everyone is willing to talk about what I'm here for, what I'm building, what do I work on when I'm not doing hackathon.
Riley: 但在黑客马拉松中，每个人都在这里尝试构建一些东西。每个人都愿意谈论他们来这里是为了什么，他们在构建什么，以及他们在不参加黑客马拉松时从事什么工作。

Riley: So, people are more open-minded to make new friends. So, yeah, it's like a great opportunity to just meet a lot of friends.
Riley: 所以，人们更乐于结交新朋友。所以，是的，这是一个结识很多朋友的好机会。

主持人: It's like new student orientation.
主持人: 这就像新生入学指导。

Riley: Yes. Yes. Yeah. Totally. And people that are doing hackathons are kind of like that too. They also want to meet new friends. I would say most people do. Yeah.
Riley: 是的。是的。没错。完全是这样。参加黑客马拉松的人也差不多是这样。他们也想结识新朋友。我想说大多数人都是这样。是的。

### 如何面对失败

Riley: Yep. So that's networking. Um, so the last point is about like how to deal with not waiting. I think it's also the like it's it's a cliche but it's like one of the most important thing for doing hackathons because if you cannot deal with not winning it's actually very hard to start doing hackathons and then or like to keep doing hackathons.
Riley: 是的。这就是人脉网络。嗯，所以最后一点是关于如何应对没有获胜。我认为这也很，嗯，这是一个老生常谈的话题，但却是参加黑客马拉松最重要的事情之一，因为如果你无法应对没有获胜，那么实际上很难开始参加黑客马拉松，或者说很难坚持参加黑客马拉松。

Riley: I think I it's like I also learned this through like all my experiences of doing other hackathons that didn't really win end up winning.
Riley: 我想我，嗯，我也是通过我参加其他没有真正赢得比赛的黑客马拉松的经验中学到这一点的。

Riley: Um, I I think for myself one of the biggest learning that I know is that like a lot of the things I would I'm doing is not going to work and I have to know that like I have to be okay with things not working.
Riley: 嗯，我想对我自己来说，我最大的一个体会是，我做的很多事情都不会成功，我必须知道这一点，我必须接受事情不成功。

Riley: And so when I first start doing hackathon, if I didn't win, I would feel really bad. I feel like, oh, I'm not good. I'm not as good as other people.
Riley: 所以当我第一次开始参加黑客马拉松时，如果我没有赢，我会感觉很糟糕。我觉得，“哦，我不够好。我不如别人。”

Riley: But as I do more, I realized there's such a randomness in all these hackathons. Maybe someone, for example, I talked about our highly philosophical LMS interpreter project, Showya.
Riley: 但随着我参加得越多，我意识到所有这些黑客马拉松都有很大的随机性。也许有人，例如，我谈到了我们那个高度哲学性的LMS解释器项目Showya。

Riley: I really like that project but that project only got the third place in the first uh, YC hackathon. I think because that YC partner didn't like the idea. She wants more practical idea that she can actually invest or she would use.
Riley: 我真的很喜欢那个项目，但那个项目在第一次YC黑客马拉松中只获得了第三名。我想是因为那位YC合伙人不喜欢这个想法。她想要更实用的、她可以实际投资或使用的想法。

Riley: But we got such good network result out of that project because the word where people really like it. it aligns with their philosophy.
Riley: 但我们从那个项目中获得了非常好的人脉结果，因为Wordware的人们真的很喜欢它。它符合他们的理念。

Riley: And yeah, like it just like it's like it's a lot of randomness. Like if you didn't win, it doesn't really mean your project is not good.
Riley: 而且是的，它就是，嗯，有很多随机性。比如如果你没有赢，并不意味着你的项目不好。

Riley: It could just be like the judges that would have liked your project a lot more didn't get to see it. And the fun is in the entire process of like doing it with friends, meeting new people, testing out different ideas, and not winning.
Riley: 可能只是那些会更喜欢你项目的评委没有看到它。而乐趣在于整个过程，比如和朋友一起做，结识新朋友，尝试不同的想法，而不是赢得比赛。

Riley: It's just like one result um, of out of that and I I also learned how to deal with like the failures before I will think like every failure is like a it's like a like a smear on my very pretty journey like my journey should be perfect like everything should look great but then as I fail more and more I I cherish all these failures even more I feel like if I fail that means I'm like trying hard enough.
Riley: 这只是其中一个结果，嗯，我，我也学会了如何处理失败。以前我会觉得每一次失败都像是我美好旅程上的一个污点，我的旅程应该是完美的，一切都应该看起来很棒。但后来随着我失败的次数越来越多，我反而更加珍惜这些失败。我觉得如果我失败了，那就意味着我足够努力了。

Riley: That's my way of feeling more secure with my life. If I don't fail enough, I actually feel a little bit uncomfortable. That means I'm not trying enough things. I'm not actually reaching my full potential.
Riley: 这是我感到生活更安全的方式。如果我失败得不够多，我反而会感到有点不舒服。这意味着我没有尝试足够多的事情。我没有真正发挥我的全部潜力。

Riley: So, every little failure is not that negative anymore. And that actually also um, like that's something that keeps motivating me to go to hackathon.
Riley: 所以，每一个小小的失败都不再那么消极了。而且这实际上也，嗯，是激励我继续参加黑客马拉松的动力。

Riley: Of course, I'm not waiting everyone. If I get really discouraged from not winning one of them, it's very hard to keep going. Yeah. So, yeah, I think that's the five key principles I have for going to hackathons.
Riley: 当然，我不是在等每个人。如果我因为没有赢得其中一个而感到非常沮丧，那很难坚持下去。是的。所以，是的，我想这就是我参加黑客马拉松的五个关键原则。

主持人: Nice. Thank you. And uh, let's go to question and answers. I think you actually answer a lot of questions in chat.
主持人: 很好。谢谢你。嗯，我们进入问答环节。我想你实际上已经回答了聊天中很多问题。

主持人: For example, how to recruit a team like how to distribute work and what motivates you to join hackathon, right? You just mentioned all of that.
主持人: 例如，如何组建团队，如何分配工作，以及是什么激励你参加黑客马拉松，对吧？你刚才都提到了。

主持人: I think one question from Shai is uh, uh, like how to balance ideas like do you have to kind of please the judge? Do you go do you have to sacrifice usefulness in order for like uh, ideas that attract more attention?
主持人: 我想Shai的一个问题是，嗯，嗯，如何平衡点子，比如你是否必须取悦评委？你是否必须牺牲实用性，以便获得更吸引眼球的点子？

主持人: Like do you think like have you ever abandoned an idea that you feel like is useful but may not win a hackathon?
主持人: 比如你认为你是否曾经放弃过一个你觉得有用但可能无法赢得黑客马拉松的点子？

Riley: Yeah, like I would say that's a very good problem to have. If you have to like balance between ideas, that means you have many many good ideas.
Riley: 是的，我想说这是一个很好的问题。如果你必须在点子之间进行平衡，那意味着你有很多很多好点子。

Riley: Um, I like it's not a very common problem to me, but I have a little list of whenever I think about something that could be a good hackathon project, I put that in in the little list.
Riley: 嗯，对我来说这不是一个很常见的问题，但我有一个小清单，每当我想到一个可能成为好的黑客马拉松项目的点子时，我就会把它写进那个小清单里。

Riley: But um, I also have this discussion with my friend like which idea we should do. I find the most rewarding thing is always to do something that you really want to build.
Riley: 但是，嗯，我也和我的朋友讨论过我们应该做哪个点子。我发现最有价值的事情总是去做你真正想构建的东西。

Riley: Um, if because in the end if we talk about like how random it is to win the hackathon if and it's always like if you want to build if you build something you think people will like it then it should be something you really want to build too.
Riley: 嗯，因为最终如果我们谈论赢得黑客马拉松的随机性，而且总是这样，如果你想构建，如果你构建的东西你认为人们会喜欢，那么它也应该是你真正想构建的东西。

Riley: If it it's not the thing that you really want, it's hard to assume that other people will really want that. And in the end, if it doesn't wing, if it's something that you really want to do, you will not feel like it's a waste of time too.
Riley: 如果它不是你真正想要的东西，就很难假设其他人也会真正想要它。而且最终，如果它没有成功，但它是你真正想做的事情，你也不会觉得这是浪费时间。

Riley: Yeah. Like I would say just build something that's like very close to your heart and you are very passionate about is the most important thing and that that is usually a very good project and that will like touch a lot of people too.
Riley: 是的。我想说，构建一个你内心非常认同、充满热情的东西是最重要的，这通常会是一个非常好的项目，也会打动很多人。

主持人: Or at least if you try to just please the judge you get nothing right often that you don't win that way.
主持人: 或者至少如果你只是试图取悦评委，你往往什么都得不到，那样你赢不了。

Riley: Yeah. Like you should please yourself and the judge. If something that you think will please the judge but it doesn't really please you. doubt that will actually please the judges too.
Riley: 是的。你应该取悦自己和评委。如果你认为某个东西会取悦评委，但它并没有真正取悦你，那它也很难真正取悦评委。

主持人: Cool. Uh, a question from Balo. How many times have you tried and what is the first win looks like for you? I guess how many times you tried before you winning the first hackathon?
主持人: 酷。嗯，Balo有个问题。你尝试了多少次，你的第一次胜利是什么样的？我想是你在赢得第一次黑客马拉松之前尝试了多少次？

Riley: Um, I think I got very lucky. Um, the my first hackathon like I win it's like a crypto hackathon. They have a lot of um, cash reward. I won like 16k out of that hackathon with my friends.
Riley: 嗯，我想我非常幸运。嗯，我赢得的第一次黑客马拉松是一个加密货币黑客马拉松。他们有很多，嗯，现金奖励。我和朋友们在那个黑客马拉松中赢得了大约1.6万美元。

Riley: So that was I was lucky. That was my first hackathon, but after that I definitely went to some hackathons I didn't win. Um, like I was I I forgot like how many times but there are a lot of times I end up with nothing and going back home.
Riley: 所以我很幸运。那是我的第一次黑客马拉松，但之后我确实参加了一些没有赢的黑客马拉松。嗯，我，我忘了有多少次了，但有很多次我一无所获地回家。

主持人: Yeah.
主持人: 是的。

Riley: How many hackathons have you been to?
Riley: 你参加过多少次黑客马拉松？

主持人: I didn't really count but maybe around like 10ish like 12 13.
主持人: 我没有真正数过，但大概10次左右，比如12、13次。

主持人: I see. Uh, one question from now and maybe we can ask one more and then uh, close it. Uh, so uh, leave your question uh, in the chat if you want to. So the question from now is uh, what do you think has contributed most to your win wins in multiple hackathon?
主持人: 我明白了。嗯，现在有一个问题，也许我们还可以再问一个，然后，嗯，就结束了。嗯，所以，如果你想提问，请在聊天中留下你的问题。那么现在的问题是，嗯，你认为是什么对你在多次黑客马拉松中获胜贡献最大？

Riley: I guess the question is like for any single one is idea plus execution but if you can win multiple one then what?
Riley: 我想这个问题是，对于任何一个项目来说，都是创意加上执行，但如果你能多次获胜，那又是什么呢？

Riley: Yeah, I think it's like um, I will say because like it's a lot of factors coming into play, but I think it's because because execution is kind of a given if you pick the right person like you know how to work together. They have like certain engineering skills. So that's not really the factor for me.
Riley: 是的，我想，嗯，我会说，因为有很多因素在起作用，但我认为是因为执行力在某种程度上是既定的，如果你选择了合适的人，比如你知道如何一起工作。他们拥有一定的工程技能。所以对我来说，这并不是真正的决定因素。

Riley: So I would say um, I think the most important part part for my hackathon wins are the ideas like if I pay a lot of attention to the daily problems or other people's daily problems I I often end up with really good ideas and then we can just um, maneuver the demo to make it look good and then in the end it's like a good hackathon project.
Riley: 所以我想说，嗯，我认为我赢得黑客马拉松最重要的部分是创意，比如如果我非常关注日常问题或他人的日常问题，我通常会得到非常好的点子，然后我们就可以，嗯，巧妙地调整演示，让它看起来很棒，最终它就是一个好的黑客马拉松项目。

Riley: So I think like observing what could be like what could please everyone in everyday life and turning into a hackathon project is pretty important.
Riley: 所以我认为，观察日常生活中什么能取悦所有人，并将其转化为一个黑客马拉松项目，这非常重要。

主持人: I guess product sense.
主持人: 我猜是产品嗅觉。

Riley: Yeah.
Riley: 是的。

主持人: Yeah.
主持人: 是的。

主持人: So I love both questions that are coming up but we can only pick one. So I'll let you pick one. The first is during your hackathon projects, have you ever encountered an area of knowledge or skill that you initially initially lacked but realized was critical to our goal?
主持人: 我很喜欢这两个问题，但我们只能选一个。所以我让你来选一个。第一个问题是，在你的黑客马拉松项目中，你是否曾遇到过一个你最初缺乏但后来意识到对我们的目标至关重要的知识或技能领域？

主持人: And then if so, how did you quickly get up to speed and apply the new knowledge? The second question is after all the hackathons accumulated, do you have a list of toolkits that you leverage the most?
主持人: 如果有的话，你是如何迅速掌握并应用这些新知识的？第二个问题是，在所有黑客马拉松经验积累之后，你有没有一个你最常使用的工具包清单？

主持人: The first is how to overcome information or knowledge gap. The second is the list of tokus.
主持人: 第一个是如何克服信息或知识鸿沟。第二个是工具包清单。

Riley: Um, I think the first one is pretty interesting because I definitely learned a lot of things in the hackathon too. Um, and I think like learning by doing is such a cliche but it's it's real.
Riley: 嗯，我觉得第一个问题很有趣，因为我在黑客马拉松中也确实学到了很多东西。嗯，而且我认为“边做边学”虽然是老生常谈，但却是真实的。

Riley: So um, because I I told you like my friend is usually engineering and I'm responsible for all the non-engineering stuff. I need to learn like design like how to do design, how to do product, how to do user journey, like a lot of things. How to network.
Riley: 所以，嗯，因为我告诉过你，我的朋友通常是负责工程方面，而我负责所有非工程方面的工作。我需要学习设计，比如如何做设计，如何做产品，如何做用户旅程，很多东西。如何建立人脉。

Riley: Um, I learned a lot of different things when I'm doing it. I I think okay, I think the most useful thing for me is just to talk to trigger or like any AI.
Riley: 嗯，我在做的过程中学到了很多不同的东西。我想，嗯，对我来说最有用的就是和触发器或者任何AI交流。

Riley: I think um, Eugene you like you and Yagu also had like a um, episode about how to ask **ChatGPT** (ChatGPT: 一种由OpenAI开发的人工智能聊天机器人，能够生成类似人类的文本回应) how to yeah for all these questions um, it will give you a very good even above average answer for different things and then you can keep building on top of that.
Riley: 我想，嗯，Eugene你和Yagu也曾有过一集关于如何向ChatGPT提问的节目，嗯，对于所有这些问题，它都会给你一个非常好的，甚至高于平均水平的答案，然后你可以在此基础上继续构建。

Riley: So I think a lot of things even like rocket science you can learn it like step by step a lot of things are not as difficult as you will think.
Riley: 所以我认为很多事情，即使是像火箭科学这样的，你也可以一步步地学习，很多事情并没有你想象的那么困难。

Riley: For example, um, I was I really wanted to do a very cute animation of like the little egg doing doing things and then but I'm no I'm not a designer. I don't really know how to do that.
Riley: 例如，嗯，我当时非常想做一个小鸡蛋做事情的可爱动画，但是，我不是设计师。我真的不知道怎么做。

Riley: Then I started like pulling random pictures and feed it into CHBT and ask it to give me like cute egg and I use a V3 to build that video animation and then sometimes it doesn't work.
Riley: 然后我开始随意找一些图片，把它们输入到ChatGPT中，让它给我生成可爱的鸡蛋，我用V3来制作那个视频动画，然后有时它不奏效。

Riley: So I try different things. I give it like all the elements and ask it to do a video or not giving anything like I just try different things and you will realize some some things are working.
Riley: 所以我尝试了不同的方法。我把所有元素都给它，让它制作视频，或者什么都不给，我只是尝试不同的方法，然后你会发现有些方法是有效的。

Riley: So the good things with AI is that it has so many information um, in the **LLM** (大型语言模型: Large Language Model，一种基于深度学习的AI模型，能够理解和生成人类语言) that it will give you average answer and the tools also make everything way easier than before.
Riley: 所以AI的好处是，它在大型语言模型中包含了如此多的信息，它会给你一个平均水平的答案，而且这些工具也让一切都比以前容易得多。

Riley: Like you don't really have to be a designer to build something that's very cute or you don't have to be an animator to actually build a good animation.
Riley: 比如，你不需要是设计师也能做出非常可爱的东西，或者你不需要是动画师也能制作出好的动画。

### 课程推荐与结束语

主持人: Cool. Let's go to the next slide and I'll do my two minutes uh, pitch. So a lot of principles you just uh, mentioned like for example trying learning from mistakes and asking the right question uh, iterate right those are the key skills in the era of AI and how to leverage the most out of these AI tools.
主持人: 酷。我们进入下一张幻灯片，我来做两分钟的，嗯，推介。所以你刚才提到了很多原则，比如尝试从错误中学习，提出正确的问题，嗯，迭代，对吧，这些都是AI时代的关键技能，以及如何最大限度地利用这些AI工具。

主持人: So our course build it with AI is kind of on this principle. I'll show you what's possible with AI and how to get there and not only through the success the successful demos but also the guided mistakes and we'll build things together with a lot of prototype and then I'll show you what works and how to get over that then what doesn't work and then how to unblock yourself and uh, it's a very hands-on course and we show you principles as well like a lot of principles holds true hold true like uh, uh, during this uh, rapid development of AI which is not common like uh, we teach you principles from a year ago.
主持人: 所以我们的“用AI构建”课程就是基于这个原则。我将向你展示AI能实现什么，以及如何实现它，不仅通过成功的演示，还通过引导式的错误，我们将一起构建许多原型，然后我将向你展示什么有效以及如何克服它，什么无效以及如何解除障碍，嗯，这是一个非常实用的课程，我们也会向你展示一些原则，比如在AI的快速发展中，很多原则仍然适用，这并不常见，比如，我们教你一年前的原则。

主持人: This is our 10th cohort and if you look at our first cohort uh, for example we do not teach RA and now it turns out RG is not the best way to do things.
主持人: 这是我们的第十期学员，如果你看我们的第一期学员，嗯，例如我们不教RAG，现在看来RAG并不是做事情的最佳方式。

主持人: Uh, so that is the course and our next cohort is November 3rd. I also dropped a link of the community. So in the community you can have discussions and ask lifetime uh, question questions Q&A uh, we'll answer our question if you uh, register uh, by the course you'll get access to the community but you can also get into the community for free uh, you just follow the like we I I don't want to just say you know how to get into the community but there is a way to get into the community for free and I invite Ry to answer a question if you have question for her like for example the kid uh, that uh, she leveraged the most.
主持人: 嗯，这就是课程，我们的下一期学员是11月3日。我还放了一个社区链接。所以在这个社区里你可以进行讨论，提出终身，嗯，问题问答，嗯，如果你通过课程注册，你将获得社区访问权限，但你也可以免费进入社区，嗯，你只需要关注，嗯，我不想直接说你知道如何进入社区，但有一种方法可以免费进入社区，我邀请Riley回答一个问题，如果你有关于她的问题，比如她最常利用的工具包。

主持人: All right, thank you for coming to this uh, lettering course and uh, have a happy weekend.
主持人: 好的，感谢大家来参加这个，嗯，课程，祝大家周末愉快。

Riley: Bye.
Riley: 再见。

主持人: Thank you, Riley.
主持人: 谢谢你，Riley。

Riley: Thank you everyone. Bye.
Riley: 谢谢大家。再见。
