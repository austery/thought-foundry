title: 预算赤字、救助文化与资本主义的困境：鲁奇尔·夏尔马的深度剖析
summary: 全球知名经济学家鲁奇尔·夏尔马深入探讨了预算赤字、政府过度干预和救助文化对现代资本主义造成的深远影响。他指出，美国长期以来的赤字习惯、储备货币地位的滥用，以及欧洲高福利社会的弊病，共同导致了生产力增长停滞和僵尸企业泛滥。夏尔马呼吁通过去监管化、解决住房负担能力问题和彻底终结救助文化来重塑资本主义，强调市场纪律和风险承担的重要性。

### 预算赤字：从常态到失控

Nicola: 大家好，我是挪威**主权财富基金**（Sovereign wealth fund: 由政府拥有和管理的投资基金）的首席执行官尼古拉·坦根。今天，我邀请到了全球经济学界最受尊敬的人物之一、洛克菲勒国际公司主席鲁奇尔·夏尔马。今年早些时候，他出版了一本非常棒的书，名为《资本主义到底出了什么问题》（"What Went Wrong with Capitalism"），我们今天就来谈谈这本书。鲁奇尔，热烈欢迎您。

<p class="english-text">hi everyone I'm Nicola tangin the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund and today I'm here with Rich shama one of the most respected voices in global economics and also the chair of Rockefeller International now earlier this year he published his book really really good what went wrong with capitalism and that's what we're going to talk about today so rich warm welcome</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 谢谢，谢谢您的邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thank you thank you for having me so</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，我们从**预算赤字**（Budget deficits: 政府支出超过收入的部分）开始吧。为什么预算赤字会成为一个问题呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's kick off with budget deficits why are budget deficits a problem</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，首先，在过去的50年左右，预算赤字显然一直不是问题。因为如果你看看这种模式，以美国为例，在其300年左右的历史中，在前250年里，美国除了在经济衰退或战争时期，从未出现过预算赤字；当时的常态是收支平衡，甚至出现盈余。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well firstly that budget deficits have apparently not been a problem for the last uh 50 years or so because if you look at the pattern Let's Take America as an example uh it's uh in it's 300 years or so of existence in the first 250 years America did not run a budget deficit except when there was an outright recession or there was like a war going on the norm was to balance the books or to run even surpluses</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 然而，从1970年代开始，这种情况开始改变。为什么呢？我认为，这种习惯的形成，有些人将其归因于**金本位制**（Gold standard: 一种货币体系，其中货币的价值与固定数量的黄金挂钩）的终结，导致了财政纪律的缺失。随后，一种文化悄然蔓延开来，认为可以运行预算赤字而不会产生任何后果。在过去的50年里，我认为美国只在其中五年实现了预算盈余，其余年份几乎每年都处于赤字状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then from the 197s that began to change why uh and I think that like in terms of that the Habit then some people B it to the fact that you had the end of the gold standards so the discipline went away and then this culture sort of crept in which is that you can run budget deficits and there are no consequences to it uh and for the last 50 years I think that America has run a budget surplus for only five of the last 50 years otherwise it's been a deficit practically every year</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 那么，它何时会成为问题呢？我认为我们现在正接近那个临界点，原因有几个。首先，历史上美国的预算赤字仍处于其他国家的水平之内。在过去的20年左右，预算赤字平均占GDP的2-3%，大多数其他发达国家也运行着类似的预算赤字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when will it become a problem I think that we are now getting to that point and our a couple of reasons for that one that historically America's budget deficits were still I'd say within the realm of other nations you know so like in the uh for the last uh 20 years or so the budget deficit averaged around 2 3% of GDP and most other developed countries were running similar budget deficits</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 然而，在过去的3到4年里，美国平均预算赤字已上升到GDP的6%。如果预测准确，明年，如果减税政策得以延长，美国的预算赤字将达到GDP的7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in the last 3 to four years the average budget deficit that America is running has gone up to 6% of GDP and uh if uh the uh projections are right next year that let's say the tax cuts are extended uh and so the budget deficit in America will get to 7% of GDP</p>
</details>

Nicola: 为什么这是一个问题呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why is it a problem</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，这是一个问题，仅仅是因为我们现在借贷的水平如此之高，以至于拍卖规模也将变得更大。我认为，市场吸收所有这些债务的能力在某个时候会受到质疑。这个问题，你知道，并没有科学依据，尤其是因为美国拥有世界**储备货币**（Reserve currency: 被各国央行和金融机构广泛持有，用于国际交易和作为外汇储备的货币），因此它有能力运行比其他国家大得多的预算赤字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah it's a problem just because of the fact that now we're getting to levels where we are borrowing so much that the auction sizes are also going to become much larger now and the Market's ability to absorb all this I think at some point is going to come into question and the issue you know there's no science behind this and especially because America has got the world's Reserve currency so it has an ability to run budget deficits that are far greater than other countries would you mind just</p>
</details>

Nicola: 您能解释一下什么是储备货币吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">explaining what a reserve currency is</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，储备货币是大多数国家将其作为主要参考货币和交易货币的货币。在过去的六七百年里，世界一直拥有一种在国际交易中占主导地位的货币。在过去的100年里是美元，之前是英镑，再之前是法国法郎，然后是西班牙、葡萄牙和荷兰的货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so the reserve currency is a currency which most uh like everybody uses as the main currency of reference the main currency of transaction the world in the last uh 6 700 years has always had one predominant currency that is used in transactions around the world last 100 years it's been the dollar before that it used to be the pound sterling before that the French Frank and then before that the Spanish and the Portuguese and the Dutch currencies and</p>
</details>

Nicola: 如果你拥有储备货币，你就可以随心所欲地运行预算赤字吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you are the reserve currency can you have as much budget deficit as you want</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，在一段时间内是的，但最终请记住，储备货币并非永久地位。它是一个长期地位，但不是永久地位。一个国家能够拥有世界储备货币的平均时间大约是100年左右。每隔100年，世界储备货币往往会发生变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh for a while yes but eventually remember that the reserve currency is not a permanent status it's a long-term status but not a permanent status the average time that a country has been able to have the world's Reserve currency has been about 100 years or so every 100 years the world's Reserve currency tends to change</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是什么导致了这种变化？当发行国负债累累、过度扩张，世界对其货币作为参考的信任度下降时，就会发生变化。我认为，对于美国而言，我们现在正达到一个荒谬的程度，美国认为他们可以随意运行任何预算赤字，而世界其他国家会继续为其提供资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what will make it change when that firey becomes too indebted it becomes too extended and the world's trust in using that currency as a reference declines and I think that with America we are now getting to that point where this has become a bit ridiculous where America thinks that they can run whatever budget deficit they want and the rest of the world will keep funding it and financing it and and</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，是什么导致了这些临界点呢？是什么让它成为一个临界点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what what causes these tipping points what is it that can make it a Tipping Point</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，通常它不是一个临界点，而是随着时间的推移逐渐发生的。但通常是当投资者，即**债券市场**（Bond market: 投资者买卖债务证券的市场），开始说“受够了”的时候。我们曾在1950年代和60年代的英国和英镑上看到过这种情况，最终他们在1970年代爆发了一场大危机。在此之前，我们也曾在法国货币上看到过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well often it's not a Tipping Point it is the fact that it gradually happens over time but it generally is the you know when the investors the bond market they begin to say enough is enough we saw that with UK and Sterling uh in the 1950s 60s and finally they had a big crisis in the 1970s and before that we saw that with the French currency so so</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，我们现在在美国没有看到这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we're not seeing it in the States now</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，目前还没有明确的迹象。我在书中还讨论了政府行为的其他后果，这些后果正在导致生产力增长放缓，并损害经济增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah there is no sign of it now at least explicitly uh there other issues I address in the book as to what are the consequences of the government action which are leading to lower productivity growth and which are undermining economic growth</p>
</details>

### 利率上升与市场反抗

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，其中一个可能导致投资者决定“我们希望以更高的价格借钱给一个国家”的时刻，我认为通常是当利息支出变得非常高时，预算的很大一部分仅仅用于支付利息支出。而且，资金的价格也发生了变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well one of the things that that could cause a moment where investors just decide listen we want to have a much higher price to lend money to a country right so I think that generally when the interest expenses become very high that a lot of the budget now goes to just paying off your interest expenses and the price of money is also changed</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 请记住，在过去的20年左右，当利率几乎为零时，为这些预算赤字提供资金要容易得多。现在，我们已经进入了一个利率高得多的时代，世界其他地区的债券市场以及其他国家已经开始表达他们的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">remember that for the last 20 years or so when you had virtually zero interest rates it was much easier to fund these budget deficits now we have moved to an Era where interest rates are far higher and the bond markets in other parts of the world with other countries are beginning to express their concern</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我们在英国看到了这一点，如果你还记得2022年，当时著名的“**利兹·特拉斯时刻**”（Liz Truss moment: 指2022年英国首相利兹·特拉斯政府试图通过大规模减税刺激经济，但引发金融市场剧烈动荡，导致英镑暴跌和政府债券收益率飙升的事件），她试图通过减税来扩大预算赤字，结果市场爆发了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we saw that in UK if you remember in 2022 what was referred to back then famously as the Liz trust moment when she tried to expand the budget deficit by cutting taxes and the market revolted</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 今年在法国也看到了这种情况，法国的预算赤字现在占GDP的6%，法国政府现在被迫以某种方式解决这个问题。这是一种我们在许多**新兴市场**（Emerging Markets: 经济正在快速发展，但尚未完全成熟的国家）和**前沿市场**（Frontier markets: 比新兴市场更小、更不发达、流动性更低的国家）中反复看到的剧本，从巴西到土耳其，再到许多其他国家，债券市场都表示：“听着，这已经太过分了，我们不能再这样下去了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we seeing that this year as well in countries such as France where the budget deficit is now at 6% of GDP and the French government is now being forced to uh address it in some way and and this is a Playbook we've seen in so many Emerging Markets you know from Brazil to Turkey to so many other Emerging Markets Frontier markets where the bond market has said listen this is far gone far too much uh we can't do this</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 如果我告诉你，有一个国家，不提美国，其预算赤字占GDP的6%到7%，其政府**债务与GDP比率**（Debt to GDP ratio: 一个国家政府债务总额与国内生产总值之比，衡量国家偿债能力）现在超过100%，并且到本十年末将成为发达国家中仅次于日本的第二高，你可能会说：“嘿，这真的很成问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if if I told you that uh without naming America that there's a country in the world today running a budget deficit which is 6 to 7% of GDP its debt to GDP government debt to GDP is now over 100% and is going to be the second highest in the developed World After Japan by the end of of this decade you would say that hey this is really problematic</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 但在美国的情况下，由于今天所有这些赤字都导致了更高的经济增长，而且由于科技和人工智能的蓬勃发展，大量资本涌入美国，这些问题正在被掩盖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in America's case because this entire deficit today is uh leading to higher economic growth uh and you have this incredible Rush of capital Coming to America because of the boom that you're seeing in technology and like AI these uh problems are being glossed over</p>
</details>

Nicola: 什么是特拉斯时刻？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is a trust moment the list trust moment</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 利兹·特拉斯时刻是市场基本上说：“好吧，我们无法为这笔钱提供资金，我们要求更高的利率来做这件事，除非你开始削减开支。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is when the market basically says okay we cannot fund this we want hire and higher interest rates to do this unless you start cutting spending</p>
</details>

Nicola: 这就是英国发生的事情，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this is what happened in the UK right</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes</p>
</details>

Nicola: 提醒我们一下，英国的利率发生了什么？特拉斯宣布……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and remind us what happened with interest rates in the UK yeah trust announces</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，利率飙升，货币贬值。因为通常在美国等地，我们习惯于利率上升时货币会走强。所以，一个表明情况正在恶化的迹象是，利率上升但货币却下跌，而不是上升。这始终是一个明确的信号，表明市场已经受够了，外国投资者正在撤退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so interest rates sort of you know spiked up the currency uh declines because generally like in America and all we used to that when interest rates go up you expect the currency to strengthen so a tell sign that something is going wrong is when interest rates go up but the currency declines doesn't go up that is always a Telltale sign that the market is now saying enough is enough and foreign investors are uh retreating</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 您刚才提到的那个国家，现在美国的利率正在上升，但货币也在上升。这表明目前还没有任何重大担忧的迹象。但我担心这些事情会很快发生变化。明年，当美国的预算赤字开始达到7%时，想象一下如果美国经济放缓会发生什么？那么预算赤字将达到GDP的8%到9%，因为如果经济放缓，收入就会减少，支出会自动增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the country you uh talked about without talking about uh they are seeing interest rates going up but also the currency going up in the US today interest rates have gone up even after the Trump uh election interest rates have gone up but but the currency is also gone up so that shows that there is no sign as yet of any big concern but my fear is that these things can turn very quickly next year the you know when the budget deficit in America begins to hit 7% imagine what happens in America if there's an economic slowdown then the budget deficit gets to 8 to 9% of GDP because if you have a Slowdown then the revenue slow down spending automatically goes up</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 所以我们正在达到完全过分的水平。我认为投资者被误导了，因为今天大部分赤字都是人为地为增长提供资金。因此，美国的经济增长看起来相当不错，你会觉得这有什么问题？但我认为，因为它是由赤字资助的，因为通常在过去，当美国处于经济周期的这个阶段，失业率如此之低时，预算赤字历史上只有GDP的1%或2%。今天，美国几乎实现了充分就业，但赤字却占GDP的6%到7%。所以我认为这是一种不可持续的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we're getting to levels which are uh completely egregious and I think that investors are being misled because a lot of this deficit today is artificially funding the growth so the economic growth in America looks pretty good and you think that what's the problem but I think that because it's being funded by the deficit because usually in the past when America has been at this stage of the economic cycle where the unemployment rate has been this low the budget deficit has historically been only 1 or 2% of GDP today you have full employment virtually in America and a deficit of 6 to 7% of GDP so this is I think uh an unsustainable situation</p>
</details>

### 欧洲资本主义的困境

Nicola: 欧洲的情况如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ria what's the score in Europe</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 欧洲的状况比美国糟糕得多。正如我在书中所说，资本主义在欧洲的状况更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Europe is in much worse shape you know than America so as I argue in the book that capitalism is in worse shape in is bad well no um not</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，其他地方呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">everywhere else but</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 不，不，不，不是所有地方，但至少是核心欧洲。因为如果你看看法国和德国，它们的**生产力增长**（Productivity growth: 衡量经济效率的指标，即每单位投入（如劳动力或资本）所产生的产出）远低于美国。在美国，生产力增长在过去30到40年里也一直在下降，但在欧洲则更为严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">core Europe at least because if you look at France Germany productivity growth is much lower than than even America in America too productivity growth has been declining for the last 30 to 40 years but in Europe it's a lot more</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 为什么会这样呢？正如有人所说，欧洲实际上是“监管的硅谷”。就像在美国，我们知道他们现在正试图打击过多的监管。我们知道监管对欧洲的中小型企业造成了巨大的负担，那里的监管负担要高得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why is this the case because as somebody said that Europe is really the Silicon value of Regulation uh like in America as we know that they're trying to now uh go after too much regulation we know that regulation has been a big burden on small to midsize businesses in Europe the regulatory burden is far higher</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 同样，在欧洲，政府支出占GDP的比例要高得多。赤字可能不高，但政府支出很高。因此，你被迫征收更多的税。在法国这样的国家，政府支出占GDP的比例接近60%。当政府支出占经济的60%时，你还能称之为资本主义社会吗？这可能是世界上仅次于朝鲜的第二高比例。那已经不是一个资本主义社会了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">similarly like in Europe government spending as a share of GDP is far higher the deficits may not be but government spending is so you're forced to tax much more and in countries like France government spending as a share of GDP is nearly 60% how do you call that a capitalist Society When government spending as a share of GDP is 60% of the economy second possibly highest in the world after North Korea that is not a capitalist Society anymore</p>
</details>

### 全球债务与“救助文化”

Nicola: 现在，**国际货币基金组织**（IMF: International Monetary Fund: 促进全球货币合作、金融稳定、国际贸易、高就业和可持续经济增长的国际组织）已经将全球所有债务加起来，总额大约是100万亿美元。这是一个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now IMF the international monetary F uh have added together all the the debt in the world they get to roughly $100 trillion is that a problem</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，我认为仅仅看总债务水平并不是我关注的问题。事实上，我在这方面做了很多工作，关于债务何时会成为问题。这是我发现的，也是我在之前的书中写过的：通常重要的不是债务水平，而是加速的速度。因为如果你在短时间内过度扩张债务，往往最终会产生坏账。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think that just looking at the total debt levels is not uh like the issue for me because in fact I've done a lot of work on this that what when is debt a problem and here's you know what I I found and something I've written about in my previous books that typically it's not the level of debt which matters but it's the pace of acceleration because if you uh extend too much debt over a short uh span of time uh often end up making bad loans and so</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 所以典型的顺序是，私营部门犯下这些错误，即出现大规模的贷款热潮，就像我们在21世纪初的美国和欧洲看到的那样，主要是在房地产市场。如果增长速度在五年内非常快，你最终会产生大量坏账，然后就会出现问题。而政府债务通常是在国家达到危机点或出现问题之后才增加的，然后政府会增加债务来救助私营部门。这是通常的事件顺序。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the typical sequence which happens is that the private sector makes uh those mistakes which is that you see a big lending boom which takes place which is what we saw in America and in Europe in the 2000s uh it was mainly into the housing markets and then be if the pace of growth is very sharp over a 5-year time Horizon you end up making lots of bad loans and then you end up having a problem and the government debt typically increases after the country has hit a crisis point or the problem then the government increases its debt to bail out the private sector that's been the usual sequence of events</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 这一次，目前正在发生的情况是，私营部门在像美国这样的地方并没有增加那么多债务。如果你看看家庭甚至企业部门，债务的增加幅度并不大。但这次不寻常的是，本应是最后贷款人的政府，其债务却呈指数级增长。所以现在的问题是，如果政府债务成为问题，你将没有最后的贷款人，因为政府本应是最后的贷款人，而债务却在那里增加了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this time what's happening currently is that the private sector has not increased debt that much in places like America if you look at the households even the corporate sector the increase in debt has not been that much but this time the unusual thing has been that the government which is supposed to be the lender of Last Resort that is where the debt has gone up exponentially and so now the problem is that if you get in trouble where the government uh debt becomes an issue you have no lender of Last Resort left because the government was supposed to be the lender of of Last Resort and that's where the debt has gone up</p>
</details>

Nicola: 您的书对资本主义有一些大胆的看法。这是您长期以来一直在思考的问题，还是某个特定时刻触发了它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now you have some bold perspectives on capitalism in your book is that something that's been kind of brewing in your mind for a long time or was it a particular moment there we triggered it</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，我认为，你知道，我写了很长时间的书。我从17岁就开始写作，所以这些想法是随着时间积累起来的，这本书就是这种思考过程的结晶。但我会说，对我来说，那个时刻是在疫情期间。在疫情期间，当我看到政府所做的一切，即关闭一切，然后说我们将提供大量的刺激措施，你可以待在家里，这无关紧要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think that um you know like I've been a writer for a long period of time I've been a I've been writing since the age of 17 so these are thoughts which keep building over time and the book is a accumulation of that thought process but I would say that for me the moment was during the pandemic that during the pandemic when I saw what governments did which is that to shut everything down and then to say that we will just give massive amounts of stimulus and you can sit home and and in terms of it it does not matter</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 然后，这些刺激措施导致了大量的**资产价格通胀**（Asset price inflation: 资产（如股票、房地产）价格的普遍上涨，通常与实体经济增长脱节），在2020年，通过居家办公而诞生的新亿万富翁数量令人难以置信，因为股市上涨，资产价格上涨。那时我才真正开始思考：资本主义到底出了什么问题？它不应该这样运作，你给人们免费的钱，尤其是那些富人和特权阶层，他们坐在家里，每天赚取超过10万美元，却还在收到支票或税收抵免。资本主义不应该这样运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then that stimulus is what led to this huge amount of asset price inflation where in 2020 the number of new billionaires which were minted by people sitting at at home was incredible because because stock markets went up asset prices went up that's when the real thought came up what's gone wrong with capitalism that this is not how it's supposed to function where you give people free money and especially the rich and the privilege sitting home uh earning more than $100,000 a day are getting checks or tax credits uh that's not how capitalism is supposed to function</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，它本应如何运作，以及您认为它现在如何运作，两者之间最大的区别是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the biggest difference between how it's supposed to function and how you believe is functioning now right so</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 好的，我认为有一点，正如有人非常巧妙地指出，那就是“没有**破产**（Bankruptcy: 个人或组织因无法偿还债务而宣布的法律状态）的资本主义就像没有地狱的基督教”。这意味着如果你有资本主义，你就必须接受风险。你不能拥有像今天这样的系统，风险被社会化了，政府告诉你，在上涨时，你可以赚尽可能多的钱，没关系，我们需要时会征税，但你可以赚所有的钱。在下跌时，我们在这里保护你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one thing I believe is the fact that uh you know as someone put it very suly which is that capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without hell which is the fact that if you have capitalism then you have to accept risk as well you cannot have a system like you have today where risk has been socialized where the you know where the governments are telling you on the upside you can make as much money as you want fine we will tax it you know when we have to but you can make all the money on the downside we are here to protect you</p>
</details>

Nicola: 这就是你所说的**救助文化**（Bailout culture: 政府或大型机构在危机时向面临破产的公司或金融机构提供财政援助的惯例），对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so this is what you call the bailout culture that's right</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">tell us about it what when did they start uh</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 尼古拉，这相对较新。因为如果你看看美国，直到1970年代，美国都认为私营部门公司不应该被救助。然后，当1970年代首次尝试救助时，在华盛顿、国会、市州各级都遇到了很大的阻力。任何关于救助私营部门公司的说法都遭到了强烈反对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is relatively new Nikolai because if you look at even America right up until the 1970s America believed that private sector companies are not meant to be bailed out and then when the first attempts at bailout happened in the 1970s there was a lot of resistance uh uh in in uh Washington uh in Congress at the city state levels any talk of bailing out private sector companies was met with Fierce amount of resistance</p>
</details>

Nicola: 但这不是很完美吗？我得到好处，如果出了问题，有人会救助我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but isn't it quite perfect I get the upside and if it goes wrong somebody bails me out</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，但这也会导致问题，因为这会导致许多低效率的公司因为这种不对称性而得以存活，从而阻止新公司进入，阻止新进入者进入系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah but that's what leads to problems also because that's where you end up having so many inefficient companies that stay alive because of that asymmetry and then it prevents new companies from entering prevents new entrance uh from um entering the system</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我认为这确实发生在1984年，那是一个里程碑式的时刻，因为那是美国首次大规模救助金融机构，即**大陆伊利诺伊银行**（Continental Illinois Bank: 曾是美国第八大银行，1984年面临破产，由美国政府实施了大规模救助）。一旦发生这种情况，此后每当金融系统出现问题，政府都会出手救助。最荒谬的情况发生在去年，**硅谷银行**（Silicon Valley Bank: 一家专注于科技初创企业的美国银行，2023年因挤兑而倒闭，随后被政府接管并救助）被救助，它是一家中型银行，拥有相对富裕的储户，所有储户都得到了救助。所以现在就有了这样的隐含假设：在任何银行，如果你存钱，政府都会保护你的存款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think that that's what really happened that in 1984 was a landmark moment because that was the first major bailout of a financial institution in America that was the the Continental Illinois Bank and once that happened then every time there's been any problem in the financial system the government's been there to bail out and the most ridiculous situation was last year where you had the Silicon Valley Bank bailout which is that it was a midsize Bank of relatively ra uh rich depositors and uh the depositors were all bailed out and so now you have the implicit assumption that at any Bank if you put money uh the government's there to protect your deposit</p>
</details>

Nicola: 所以最初这被称为**格林斯潘看跌期权**（Greenspan Put: 指市场相信美联储（在艾伦·格林斯潘担任主席期间）会在股市下跌时通过降息等方式进行干预，从而为市场提供“保护”）。因为他是当时发生这种情况的央行行长。但这种情况再次发生会有什么影响呢？

<details>

<p class="english-text">so originally this was called the green span put right cuz he was a central Banker when it happens at the first time but what are the implications of this happening again</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的，格林斯潘看跌期权有点不同。我们谈到了大陆伊利诺伊银行的救助文化，格林斯潘看跌期权也非常重要。讽刺的是，我们把1980年代与里根和撒切尔夫人解放自由市场和资本主义的黄金时代联系在一起，这是普遍的印象。然而，一些完全扭曲资本主义的里程碑时刻却发生在1980年代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes the green span put's a bit different so we spoke about the bailout culture of Continental like Illinois the greenpan put was also very significant and this is the irony of it we associate the 1980s with this Golden Era of free markets and capitalism being Unleashed by Reagan and Thatcher and stuff that's the popular image and yet a couple of landmark moments which totally distorted capitalism happened in the 1980s</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我们谈到了1984年大陆伊利诺伊银行的救助，这是二战后历史上首次大规模救助金融机构的里程碑。然后在1987年，当股市崩盘时，央行首次明确降息并干预以支撑股市。这创造了格林斯潘看跌期权的感觉，也就是说，政策制定者再次表示，在上涨时，我们不知道如何预测泡沫或市场何时变得过于昂贵，所以我们什么也不做。在下跌时，如果发生什么事，我们在这里收拾残局。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we spoke spoke about the bailout of Continental Illinois in 1984 which was a landmark as the first major bailout of a financial institution in post World War II history and then in 1987 for the first time when the stock market crashed the Central Bank explicitly cut interest rates and intervened to prop up the stock market and that created this feeling of a green span put which is that once again on like on the upside the policy makers say we don't know how to predict bubbles or when markets become too expensive so we'll do nothing about it on the downside if something happens we are here to clean up the mess</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，您说我们已经对这种类型的帮助、支持和救助上瘾了，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um you say that we become addictive to these type of help support bailouts right</p>

Ruchir Sharma: 是的。

<p class="english-text">yeah</p>
</details>

Nicola: 现在，您如何让市场摆脱这种依赖呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how do you win markets off it</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，这非常困难，但我想说，对于任何即将上任的总统或其他领导人来说，就是要明确表示我们不相信**救助文化**。如何表明这一点呢？不是通过让某些东西破产，而是通过在经济状况良好时就预先阻止它。因为一旦发生危机，就变得非常困难，因为一旦发生危机，每个人都在争先恐后地寻找解决方案。但如果你从一开始就明确表示这不是我们所相信的文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well it's very difficult but I'd say that in terms of that's what I said you know that that for any incoming president or something it's to make it very clear that we do not believe in a bailout culture uh in terms and how do you show that by letting something go bus no by by s it uh preventively before in good times because once you have a crisis it becomes very difficult because once you have a crisis then everyone scrambling to find a solution but if you make it clear to the outset that this is not the culture we believe in and</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 请记住，你知道，这就是我发现的巨大讽刺之处，我们通常说**民粹主义**（Populism: 一种政治意识形态，通常将社会分为“普通民众”和“精英阶层”，并主张由普通民众代表的政治力量）和经济民粹主义是糟糕的经济学，民粹主义应该是支出、赠予等等。但这里有一个民粹主义措施，我认为是好的经济学，那就是如果你说“不救助”，因为救助对于普通人来说是非常不受欢迎的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">remember you know this is what I find like the great irony of it that usually we say populism and an economic populism is bad economics that you know populism is supposed to be spending giveaways and stuff like that but here is one populist measure which I think is good economic ICS if you say no bailouts because bailouts remember are very unpopular with the average person</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 2008年的救助，你可以说它们是银行系统所必需的，但它们在普通美国人中非常不受欢迎。因为他们看到他们的小型社区银行倒闭，却看到这些大型银行得到救助。我认为这为今天如此多的反建制情绪和愤怒埋下了种子。所以我认为这是其中一个解决方案，但我在书中提供了许多解决方案，以试图纠正这个系统，让普通美国人或西方社会中的普通人觉得经济系统没有为他们服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the 2008 bailouts you can argue that they were required of the banking system they were very unpopular with the average American they were because they saw their small Community Banks fail and yet they saw these large Banks getting bailouts and that I think SED the seeds for so much of the anti-establishment feeling the anger that we have today so I think that that's one of the solutions out here but there are a whole bunch of solutions that I offer in the book as to what can be done to try and correct this system where the average American or the average person in Western societies feels that the economic system is not working for them</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 第一步是认识到这一点。即使在美国，我发现令人震惊的是，有很多人否认，说“哦，经济运行良好，我们增长了2.5%，有什么问题？”不，不，我们增长了2.5%，但这只是表面数据。深入了解一下，对经济系统不满的人数是惊人的。有70%的美国人表示他们希望经济系统被推翻，国家正朝着错误的经济方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">first step is to recognize this what I find shocking even in America is that you know like in terms of the number of people who are in denial to say the oh the economy is doing fine we're growing at 2 and a half% what's the problem in terms of that no no we're growing at 2 and a half% but that's at the headline level look beneath the hood the number of people who are dissatisfied with the economic system is staggering there are 70% of Americans say they want the economic system to be torn down and the country is moving in the wrong economic Direction</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我认为这是一个非常重要的因素，甚至在这次选举中也是如此，也是过去三届美国总统选举中，执政党在白宫失利的一个非常重要的原因。这以前从未发生过，或者至少在我所知的过去150年里从未发生过。

<details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you say that capitalism in Europe is dysfunctional what do you mean by that</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我的意思是，正如我所说，如果我们在美国谈论过度监管、过度支出和过于福利主义社会的问题，那么在欧洲，这些问题甚至更严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that I mean like in Europe as I said that if we talk about problems in America of overregulation over uh spending and too much of a uh welfarist Society then in Europe those problems are even greater</p>
</details>

Nicola: 您认为美国正朝着同样的方向发展吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you think America is going in the same direction</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 完全正确。这就是正在发生的事情，如果你看看福利支出占GDP的比例，美国正在非常迅速地赶上欧洲。我指的是核心欧洲，正如我所说，在欧洲我们也要区分，有核心欧洲，比如法国、德国等国，但欧洲也有一些好的例子。我提到的一些国家，比如瑞士，我说，你知道，它是世界上最富有的国家，也是20大经济体之一，它们似乎在政府支出占GDP的比例方面找到了更好的平衡。没有乌托邦式的国家，但它们在平衡方面做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exactly so that's what's happening which is if you look at welfare spending as a share of GDP America is very quickly catching up with Europe now and I'm talking about core Europe as I say like in Europe also we have to make distinctions that there is core Europe uh which is the France Germany of the world but then there are some good examples in Europe too one of the countries I speak about are countries like Switzerland where I say that here you know like it's the richest country in the world it is among the 20 largest economies and they seem to get the balance much correct in terms of their spending as a share of GDP there is no utopian Nation but uh they get the balance correct</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 另一方面，你知道，即使在斯堪的纳维亚等地，像瑞典这样的国家，当它们在1990年代过度扩张并面临危机时，它们也被迫削减政府支出。在1990年代早期，政府支出占GDP的比例曾达到70%左右，它们遭遇了危机，然后好的一点是，这些国家今天比美国更具财政纪律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the other hand and you know this even in places like Scandinavia and staff that that places like Sweden and all that that when they became very overextended in the 1990s and they faced a crisis even they were forced to pull back their government spending as a share of GDP had reached 70% and stuff in the early 1990s and they reached a crisis and then the good thing is that these countries uh are much more fiscally disciplined today compared to let's say America</p>
</details>

Nicola: 那么，您认为欧洲国家会开始削减政府支出吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so do you think the countries in Europe will start to pull back on government spending</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，我不确定他们是否会开始削减政府支出，因为很少有国家会在面对危机之前这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I'm not sure that they're going to start to pull back but you know like on government spending because very few do it until they face a crisis</p>
</details>

Nicola: 您认为什么会引发危机？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think will cause the crisis</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 债券市场。你知道，当债券市场反抗时。我们在英国看到了这一点，今年在法国也看到了一些迹象。所以我认为唯一的办法是当市场说“受够了”，我们无法再为这些赤字、这些支出提供资金了。新兴市场一直都看到这种情况，市场会说“我们就是无法为这笔钱提供资金”。希腊也发生过这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the bond market that you know when the bond market revolts we saw that in UK we and we're seeing some signs of that in France this year so I think that the the only way is when the market says enough is enough we cannot fund these deficits we can't fund this spending anymore and Emerging Markets have seen that all the time which is that you know that the markets say we just can't fund this it happened to Greece too</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 事实上，欧洲经济转型的典范一直是希腊。十年前的这个时候，我们都对希腊及其危机感到厌倦。他们被迫削减开支，但他们面临了危机。问题是，如果你不面临危机，你就可以继续扩张和假装。日本就是这样做的，意大利也是这样做的。所以有时，发生危机反而更好，因为它能迫使改变，因为那样社会和人民才能理解削减开支和改变的原因。如果你没有一场彻底的危机，即使问题本质上是隐蔽的，也没有动力去削减它。我认为这就是我们今天许多西方社会所面临的局面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in fact the the poster child of an economic turnaround story in Europe has been Greece that Greece at this time last decade we were all what it sick about Greece and the crisis in Greece they were forced to cut back but but they faced a crisis the problem is if you don't face a crisis then you can keep on extending and pretending that's what Japan has done that's what Italy has done so it's almost sometimes better to have a crisis to force change because then the society the people understand the reason for cutting back and for change if you don't have an outright crisis even if the problem is Insidious in nature there is no incentive to cut it back and I think that that's where we stand today with many Western societies</p>

### 生产力下降与“僵尸企业”

Nicola: 随着许多国家公共部门活动的增加，这对这些国家的生产力有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">with the increased public sector um activity in many countries what are the implications for productivity in those countries</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，正如我所说，如果你看看**生产力增长**，这是一个巨大的悖论，对吧？在过去的30到40年里，生产力增长一直在下降，尽管我们经历了一些令人难以置信的科技繁荣。所以我认为唯一能解释这一点的原因是，在过去的30到40年里，政府的作用增加了。因为生产力增长应该在科技繁荣的推动下上升，除了1990年代末和21世纪初的短暂时期，当时科技繁荣带来了生产力的巨大增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well as I said that if you look at productivity growth and this is the great Paradox right which is that productivity growth in the last 30 to 40 years has been declining even though we've had some incredible technology booms through it uh and so I think that the only way that you can explain it is that because you've had this increased role of government in the last 30 to 40 years because productivity growth should be going up on the back of the tech boom and except for a brief period in the late 1990s and and early 2000s when you had the tech boom and you saw big increase in productivity yeah um</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 否则，生产力一直在下降。现在，在疫情之后，我们看到美国等地的生产力有所提高，但这可能是因为出现了一些洗牌，一些旧企业倒闭，一些新企业开始。但过去30到40年的趋势一直是下降的。悖论是，在如此令人难以置信的科技繁荣中，为什么生产力会下降？我能找到的唯一解释是，政府的作用大大增加了，它扭曲了资本主义。如果风险被社会化，那么系统中就会出现大量的“**僵尸企业**”（Zombie companies: 指那些虽然持续经营，但其利润不足以支付利息费用，只能依靠持续借贷或政府补贴维持生存的公司）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">otherwise productivity has been declining now um after the pandemic we've seen some increase in productivity in places like the United States but that could be because you got some churn out there where where old businesses were some shut down some new ones began but the trend has been down for the last 30 to 40 years the Paradox is why do we have a decline in productivity in the midst of this incredible Tech boom and the only explanation that I can find uh over this time is the fact that the role of the government has increased a lot it has distorted capitalism that if you if risk is being socialized then then you will have a lot of Deadwood float up in the system</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我在书中也谈到了一个重要主题，那就是僵尸企业的概念。我认为这很吸引人。你知道，“僵尸企业”这个词在1990年代的日本首次流行起来，当时如果你读当时的西方媒体，甚至是美国媒体，他们几乎会嘲笑这些僵尸企业，这些公司甚至没有足够的利润来支付连续三年的利息支出。他们认为这些公司只存在于日本，在美国不存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and one of the big themes I speak about as well in the book as well is the concept of zombie companies and I think this is fascinating which is that you know uh this term zombie companies first became popular in Japan and the 1990s uh when um and if you read the Western press then or of even the American Press and staff they would almost be scornful that you know these zombie companies which are defined as companies that don't even make enough profit to cover their interest expenses for three years in a row that these companies exist in places like Japan it's not in in in in like America they don't exist</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 在1990年代，僵尸企业大约占美国上市公司总数的2%。今天，根据**国际清算银行**（BIS: Bank for International Settlements: 促进各国央行之间合作的国际金融机构）等一些估计，僵尸企业占美国上市公司总数的近20%。为什么会发生这种情况？那是因为你通过宽松的货币和救助，让系统中如此多的“僵尸”得以存活。如果你有这么多僵尸企业，那么效率会低得多，这是理所当然的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in the 1990s zombie companies were roughly 2% of the total amount of listed companies in places like America today by some estimates such as the bis the number of zombie companies is close to 20% of the total number of listed companies in places like America why has that happened that's because you've kept so much Deadwood alive in the system because of easy money bailouts that and if you have so many zombie companies it only stands to reason that it'll be much more inefficient now</p>

### 重塑资本主义的路径

Nicola: 那么，如果您能做出一些改变，让资本主义走上更好的道路，您会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so if you could make some changes to put capitalism on a better path what would you do</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 嗯，我想说，什么是实际可行的，什么是不可行的。削减开支、福利等等是不实际的，不会发生，所以我们甚至不走那条路。那么，有哪些三到四个实际可行的建议可以做呢？我认为**去监管化**（Deregulation: 减少或取消政府对经济活动的管制）是非常重要的一步，因为受监管伤害最大的人往往是中小型企业，而今天这些企业的信心非常低。大型公司几乎喜欢监管，因为它们能够负担得起，而且它们能够以有利于自己的方式制定法规，因为它们在华盛顿等首都城市拥有所有的游说者。所以去监管化非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I'd say that what's practical and what's practical right so cutting spending welfare and all is Not Practical it's not going to happen so let's not even go down that path what are the three to four practical suggestions that anyone can do uh to to try and do that so I do think that deregulation is a very big step because the people who are hurt the most by regulation tend to be the small and midsize businesses and that's where confidence today is really low the large companies they're able to uh they almost like regulation because they they're able to uh afford it and they're able to also write regulations in the way which favor them because they have all the lobbyists uh in the capital city such as Washington so deregulation is very important</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我认为第二件非常重要的事情是，如果我要说资本主义出了什么问题的首要象征，那就是房价。在美国这样的地方，买一套新房是负担不起的。今天与父母同住的20多岁年轻人超过50%。今天表示无法实现拥有自己房屋的所谓“美国梦”的美国人数量惊人地高。所以房价上涨了很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the second thing I think which is very important is that if you if I were to say what's the leading symbol of what went wrong with capitalism it is housing prices that in places like America it is unaffordable to buy a new home uh the number of 20 year olds who are living in with their parents today is more than 50% the number of Americans who say today that you know that they'll not be able to realize their so-called American dream of having their own home is staggeringly high so home prices have gone up a lot and</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 房价上涨的一个重要原因是，你有如此多的监管，以至于现在很难建造新房，所以供应非常短缺。另一方面，如果利率非常宽松，那么对住房的需求就非常高。所以你有一个巨大的不匹配。所以我认为，重新关注让住房变得负担得起，必须是资本主义的一个核心问题，无论是改善分区编码法律，还是解决**邻避主义**（NIMBYism: “Not In My Backyard”的缩写，指居民反对在其社区附近建设新项目，即使这些项目对更广泛的社会有益）文化，这都是需要做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one of the big reasons home prices have gone up a lot is because uh you have so much amount of Regulation that it's very difficult to build new homes now and so Supply is very short on the other hand if you have very easy interest rates then the demand is very high for for for home so you got this massive mismatch so I think focusing on making homes affordable again has to be a central issue for capitalism whether it's got to do with improving zoning coding laws the culture of nimbyism that's that's something else which needs to be done</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 我认为另一件事是，正如我所说，这种救助文化需要终结。你知道，这需要预先完成，你不能在危机中做。而是在经济扩张期间，让领导人说：“你们私营部门公司如果遇到麻烦，你们需要自己解决，不要指望我们来救助你们。”我认为这些是纠正资本主义可以采取的一些基本步骤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think that the other thing also as I say is that this culture of bailouts needs to end that you know and it needs to be done preemptively you can't do it in the middle of a crisis but in the middle of an expansion for you know like you know for the leaders to say that we you the private sector companies get in trouble you guys need to sort this out on your own don't expect us to come and bail you out these are some of the basic steps which can be taken I think to try and uh right capitalism</p>
</details>

Ruchir Sharma: 此外，我认为在经济扩张期间运行如此大规模赤字的整个想法，有什么理由这样做呢？我认为很多人担心债务状况，年轻人认为他们将不得不承担所有这些债务，并在某个时候偿还。所以，我认为这些是纠正资本主义需要采取的一些基本步骤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and also I think that this whole idea of running deficits this large in the middle of an economic expansion you know like what's the justification for doing it uh I think that a lot of people are worried about you know what the debt situation is the younger people it leads to geter intergenerational tension they think that they're going to be left with all this debt uh to try and service at some point in time so I think these are some of the basic steps which need to be taken to right capitalism</p>
