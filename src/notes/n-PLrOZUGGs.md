### 欧盟竞争法的执行与数字技术监管

许多**反垄断案件**（Anti-Trust cases: 旨在防止垄断、促进市场竞争的法律诉讼）已经针对全球最强大的公司提起，包括苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊和Meta。我相信，玛格丽特·维斯塔格，当你的名字出现在全球所有首席执行官的收件箱中时，他们都会感到紧张。但非常欢迎你来到这个播客。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many antitrust cases have been brought against the most powerful companies in the world, including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. I'm sure, Margrethe, that all CEOs in the world get proper nerves when your name shows up in their inbox. But a big welcome to this podcast.</p>
</details>

非常感谢。当然，我希望他们能完全保持冷静，因为他们喜欢竞争，并且知道自己站在竞争法的正确一边。你的头衔很长，你的职责是什么？嗯，正如你所说，我主要负责执行**欧洲竞争法**（European competition law: 欧盟旨在确保公平竞争和消费者利益的法律框架），但我也肩负着协调欧洲充分利用数字技术的责任，确保技术服务于民众。实现这一目标的关键是，你必须能够信任技术。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you very much. And of course, I hope that they completely keep their calm because they like competition and they know that they're on the right side of competition law. Now, you have a very long title. What is your mandate? Well, basically, as you say, I enforce European competition law, but I also have a coordinating responsibility for Europe to make the best use of digital technology, ensuring that technology serves people. The tool to make that happen is, of course, that you can trust technology.</p>
</details>

### 欧盟的数字技术监管目标

监管的目的是什么？我认为，如果你审视欧洲对待新技术的态度，我们会比地球上其他地区更倾向于规避风险。例如，我们的**人工智能法规**（AI regulation: 旨在规范人工智能技术开发和应用的法律框架）旨在确保我们能够信任在关键情况下使用的人工智能。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the aim of regulation? Well, I think that if you look at how Europe approaches new technology, we tend to be more risk-averse than in other parts of our planet. And for instance, our AI regulation, the point of that is to make sure that we can trust when AI is being used in situations where it may be critical.</p>
</details>

如果一个市政当局使用人工智能来决定谁可以获得社会福利，那么你确实需要确保有人类参与其中，并且你可以信任人工智能能够做出正确的判断。这并非理论，因为我们已经有了第一起丑闻。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If a municipality is using AI to decide who can get a social benefit, then you really need to make sure that there is a human in the loop and that you can trust the AI to get it right. And this is not theory, because we've had the first scandal.</p>
</details>

如果你看看像**数字服务法案**（Digital Services Act: 欧盟旨在规范在线平台、确保网络安全和用户权利的法律）这样的立法，它要求服务提供商确保其服务是安全的。例如，Instagram不能引发精神疾病，TikTok或Twitter（X）不能被用来破坏我们的民主。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you look at a piece of legislation like the Digital Services Act, it obliges service providers to make sure that their services are safe, that for instance, Instagram cannot provoke mental illnesses, that TikTok or Twitter (X) cannot be used to undermine our democracy.</p>
</details>

而**数字市场法案**（Digital Markets Act: 欧盟旨在限制大型在线平台“守门人”行为、促进数字市场公平竞争的法律）旨在确保市场开放且可竞争，从而使投资初创企业和规模化企业变得有价值。因为你知道，这取决于他们的创意、职业道德、资本和产品，而不是取决于某个“守门人”是否向市场开放大门。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the Digital Markets Act is there to make sure that the market is open and contestable, so that it is worthwhile to invest also in start-ups and scale-ups, because you know that it depends on their idea, their work ethic, their capital, their product, it doesn't depend on some gatekeeper opening the gate to the market or not.</p>
</details>

通过这三个例子，我试图表明，监管是保持市场健康、确保技术真正服务于我们的一种方式，同时也能确保有充足的创新空间。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with these three examples, I try to show that regulation is a way to keep the market healthy and to make sure that technology actually is here to serve us, and in doing so, also making sure that there is plenty of room for innovation.</p>
</details>

### 欧洲内部竞争与全球竞争力

我们将回到数字方面，这当然非常重要且具有时效性。但总的来说，你如何平衡欧洲内部的竞争与欧洲在全球的竞争力？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll come back to the digital side of things, which is of course very, very important and topical. But just generally, how do you balance competition within Europe versus Europe being competitive globally?</p>
</details>

非常重要的是，你必须在你的**单一市场**（Single Market: 欧盟内部商品、服务、资本和人员自由流动的区域）中锻炼你的竞争“肌肉”，这就是为什么欧盟的单一市场应该运行良好，在某些情况下甚至比现在更好，以便能够在欧盟之外的全球市场中赢得竞争。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very important that you exercise your competitive muscle in your home market, which is why the single market of the European Union should work well, and in some instances, better than today, in order to be able actually to win the competition outside of the European Union on the global market.</p>
</details>

我们刚刚重新审视了一项我们五六年前禁止的并购案，那是**西门子**（Siemens: 德国工业巨头）和**阿尔斯通**（Alstom: 法国交通运输公司）之间的合并。它因为信号系统和高速列车的原因被禁止，因为这些公司无法找到解决竞争问题的方法。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We just revisited a merger that we prohibited five, six years ago, which was the merger between two companies, Siemens and Alstom. And it was prohibited on grounds of signaling systems and very high-speed trains, because the companies couldn't find ways to solve the competition problems.</p>
</details>

它们在欧洲的市场份额会非常高。当时有很多关于中国将超越全球市场的讨论。我们现在重新审视了市场，结果发现中国公司在中国市场非常强大，但在其他任何重要的市场中并非如此。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They would have very, very high market shares in Europe, and there was a lot of talk about this, that the Chinese would overtake the global market. We've revisited the market now, and it turns out that the Chinese are very big in China, but not in many, in any other markets of significance.</p>
</details>

特别是两家公司，它们的订单量饱满，并且表现出色。这两家公司实际上就是全球市场中的西门子和阿尔斯通。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Two companies in particular have filled order books and are playing really well, and those two companies actually are Siemens and Alstom in the global marketplace.</p>
</details>

### 并购审查与市场预测的挑战

你是否禁止过本不该禁止的合并？我不这么认为，因为我们很少这样做，而且我们非常克制。我们尽最大努力确保企业能够解决我们可能存在的竞争担忧。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you prohibited mergers which you should not have prohibited? I don't think so, because it's something that we do really rarely, and we do it with a lot of restraint. We go to the utmost efforts to make sure that businesses can solve the competition concerns that we may have.</p>
</details>

因为决定企业是否应该合并不是我们的职责，我们的职责是确保如果它们合并，后续的竞争问题能够得到解决。所以，只有在企业不愿意或无法解决竞争问题的情况下，我们才会采取禁止措施。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because it's not for us to decide whether businesses should merge or not, it's for us to make sure that if they merge, follow-on competition problems should be solved. So only in a situation where the businesses either don't want to or cannot solve competition problems would we take a step to a prohibition.</p>
</details>

那么，你放行的那些合并中，有哪些是本该阻止的呢？这很难说。我们尝试重新审视我们对竞争问题的解决方案是否真正奏效。这是一项非常困难的工作，因为我们可能会说，我们需要先进行**剥离**（Divest: 出售公司部分资产或业务），我们需要知道你希望将存在市场重叠的业务剥离给谁，否则你可能会形成**事实垄断**（Defacto monopoly: 虽无法律规定，但在实践中占据市场主导地位）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And which of the ones you have let through should you have stopped? Well, that is difficult to say. We try to revisit if the solutions to competition problems, if they actually work. And that's a very difficult discipline, because it may be that we say, we need to have a fix it first, we need to know to whom you want to divest this business where you have an overlap in a market where you would have a maybe a de facto monopoly.</p>
</details>

然后我们审查被剥离业务的买家，一切可能看起来都很好，包括财务状况。但两三年后，问题可能就会出现，市场发生变化，然后发现买家无法成功经营。这当然非常痛苦，因为客户和员工都会因此受苦。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then we look at the buyers of this divested business, and it may all look fine, also financially. But then maybe two years down the road, three, four years down the road, problems arise, markets change, and then it turns out that the buyer cannot make it. That of course is really painful, because customers will suffer from this, workers will suffer from this.</p>
</details>

但预测买家几年后是否仍具备财务能力也是非常困难的。我们更倾向于选择市场内的买家，这样他们就具备必要的市场知识。例如，如果是在化工行业，我们更倾向于让同样在化工行业的人购买被剥离的业务，而不是风险投资基金或其他类似的机构，以便有人能够真正进入该市场，利用资产，成为该市场中的竞争力量。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's also very, very difficult to predict whether a buyer years down the road will still have the financial capacity. We prefer a buyer which is in the market, so that you have the necessary knowledge about the market. For instance, if it's in chemicals, we prefer someone who's also in chemicals to buy a divested business, rather than a venture fund or something like that, in order for someone actually to go into that market, use the asset, be a competitive force in that market.</p>
</details>

### 监管的平衡：速度与质量

你认为我们现在面临的风险是监管不足还是监管过度？我认为风险在于，监管有时制定得很快，但没有完全实施。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think where we are now that there is a bigger risk for underregulation or overregulation? I think the risk is that regulation sometimes is made quite fast and that is not implemented in full.</p>
</details>

因此，最好是有一个周密、深思熟虑的立法过程和实施，而不是因为你认为当下有需求就仓促行事。即使你认为当下有需求，良好立法的关键在于它能够完全实施，并且你有足够的资源来完全实施它。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's better to have a thorough, thoughtful legislative process and implementation than rushing to something because you think you have a need here and now. Even if you think that you have a need here and now, the key for good legislation is that it's fully implemented and that you have resources to fully implement it.</p>
</details>

当我谈论深思熟虑的监管时，是指你有时间听取各方意见的监管：行业意见、**非政府组织**（NGOs: Non-Governmental Organizations: 独立于政府的非营利性组织）的意见、以及其他相关监管机构的意见。因为这样你才能更有可能制定出一部能够以最轻微的方式解决合法且已证实问题的立法。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I talk about thoughtful regulation, it is regulation where you have time to take views on board: views of industry, views of NGOs, views of those who take an interest, other regulators. Because then you will have a much higher probability of making a piece of legislation where you're solving a legitimate, proven problem in the lightest possible manner.</p>
</details>

因为我认为，在某些行业，我们确实存在相当沉重的官僚负担，企业会觉得“当然，没问题，我们会照做，但这难道不能以更轻便的方式完成吗？”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because we have, I think, quite a heavy bureaucratic burden on some sectors where businesses find that, well, of course, fine, sure, we'll do this, but couldn't that have been done in a lighter manner?</p>
</details>

### 产业政策与欧洲冠军企业

你是否与产业政策协调工作？你是否曾坐下来思考，我们需要在某个行业或另一个行业中培养一个更大的“冠军”企业，以便与美国、中国等国家竞争？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do you coordinate your work with industrial policy? Do you ever sit down and think, you know what, we need a bigger champion in this industry or that industry in order to compete with America, China, and so on?</p>
</details>

我认为一个支持竞争性合并的最佳例子是**空中客车**（Airbus: 欧洲航空航天制造商）的创建，这可以追溯到很多年前。如果当时没有发生那次合并，那么宽体飞机的生产商就只会有一家。我认为这是一个很好的例子，当市场状况非常不平衡，并且可以通过合并企业来做些什么，从而使它们能够扩大规模。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the best example of a pro-competitive merger is the creation of Airbus. It goes back many years by now. Had that not happened, there would only have been one producer of widebody airplanes. And I think that's a very good example where you have a market situation that is really unbalanced, and where you can do something by combining businesses, then become able to scale.</p>
</details>

我希望下一届委员会能彻底审视国防工业，因为国防预算正在增加，而我们今天大部分的支出都在欧洲之外。欧洲国防工业确实有整合的空间，以便在面对欧洲以外的竞争对手时更具竞争力。我认为这是一个显而易见的例子。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would hope that the next commission would have a thorough look at the defense industry, since defense budgets are increasing and we spent most of that today outside of Europe. There is indeed room for consolidation of a European defense industry in order to be more competitive towards competitors outside of Europe. I think that's an obvious example.</p>
</details>

第三种方法是让**单一市场**充分发挥作用。我们仍然有一些市场，其国家特色比欧洲层面更为明显。我们确实缺乏一个**欧洲资本市场**（European Capital Market: 欧盟内部统一的资本交易市场），我们确实缺乏一个**欧洲电信市场**（Telco market: 电信服务市场）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A third approach to that would be to look at the single market to make it work in full. We still have markets where their national characteristics are much more obvious than in European dimension. We really miss a European Capital Market, we really miss a European Telco market.</p>
</details>

这当然使得整合更加棘手，因为那样就更难从跨境合并中获得效率，而一个真正的欧洲单一市场将是锻炼竞争“肌肉”并更好地在欧洲之外扩大规模的更肥沃的土壤。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that of course makes consolidation more tricky, because then it's more difficult to harvest efficiencies in what would be cross-border mergers where a true European single market would be a much better sort of fertile ground to exercise your competitive muscle and be better to scale also outside of Europe.</p>
</details>

你说我们缺乏一个欧洲电信市场，但这难道不是因为你吗？不，在美国我们有三家运营商，而在欧洲，每个国家都有三家，对吧？所以我们总共有30家，它们都很小，而且经营得不太好。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You say we lack a European Telco market, but isn't that because of you? No, in America we have three operators, in Europe we have three in each country, right? So we have a total of 30. They're all tiny, well, and not doing that well.</p>
</details>

不，这不是因为我。这是因为市场结构。我认为欧洲最大的四家运营商，它们服务了大约60%的客户。所以我们的情况与美国并没有那么大的不同。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it's not because of me. It's because of market structure. I think the four biggest operators in Europe, they organize about 60% of all customers. So it's not that we have a situation that is that much different from the US.</p>
</details>

不同之处在于，对于在多个国家开展业务的公司，它们仍然必须考虑国家特色。我们甚至没有一个欧洲统一的电话区号。法规存在差异，国家监管机构处理事务的方式也存在差异。所以我们需要的是一个真正的欧洲电信市场，然后我认为我们会有更大的电信企业，因为它们会在这个市场中实现有机增长。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The difference is that for the businesses who are in more than one country, they are still having to look at national characteristics. We do not even have a European prefix. There are differences in regulation, there are differences in how things are done by national regulators. So what we need is a true European market for Telco, and then I think we would have bigger Telco businesses, because then would they would grow also organically within that market.</p>
</details>

### 人工智能监管：关注应用而非技术本身

稍微转移一下话题，花些时间谈谈技术，这当然是目前非常热门的话题。OpenAI的**萨姆·奥特曼**（Sam Altman: OpenAI首席执行官）和Anthropic的**达里奥·阿莫迪**（Dario Amodei: Anthropic首席执行官）都说他们不完全理解先进人工智能模型是如何工作的。那么你们如何理解呢？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving a bit and spending some time on technology, which of course is extremely topical now. Sam Altman of OpenAI and Dario Amodei of Anthropic say that they don't fully understand how the advanced AI models work. Now, how can you guys understand it?</p>
</details>

我们不尝试去理解，因为我认为试图监管技术是过于雄心勃勃的。我们关注的是技术的使用，因为在应用场景中，你会看到人类可能被压榨、歧视，或者不被视为他们本来的样子。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we don't try, because it's I think it's overly ambitious to try to regulate technology. What we occupy ourselves with is to look at the use of technology, because it's in the use cases that you see that humans may be squeezed, discriminated, not seen as who they are.</p>
</details>

所以，如果**算法**（Algorithm: 一系列用于解决问题或执行任务的指令）是人工智能算法的第一代、第二代、第三代、第四代，那可能需要开发者来弄清楚如何处理透明度和可解释性。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if the algorithm, the AI algorithm is Generation 1, 2, 3, 4, well, that may be for the developers to figure out how to work with transparency and explainability.</p>
</details>

例如，一个成员国的医疗系统使用人工智能作为医生诊断和治疗决策的辅助技术，对他们来说，非常重要的是要知道当他们使用这项技术时，算法能够识别男性和女性的症状。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For instance, a health system in a member state to use artificial intelligence as a supportive technology to the doctors making decisions about diagnosis and treatment, it's really important for them to know that when they use that, the algorithm will actually recognize symptoms both in a man and in a woman.</p>
</details>

所以我们关注的是这种应用场景，并确保那些负责应用场景的人知道他们在做什么，然后将这些信息反馈给开发者，让他们说：“好吧，我希望在欧洲医疗市场占有一席之地，所以我应该确保我的人工智能算法具备这些功能，以便你可以安全地投入使用，而不会冒着，例如，一半人口被忽视的风险，因为你无法识别女性心脏病发作的症状。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we are looking at that use case and sort of making sure that those who are responsible for the use case know what they are doing, and for that then to filter back to developers, so say, okay, I would want to have my share of the European health market, so I should make sure that my AI algorithm would have the features that you can safely put that into use without risking, in this example, half of the population because you do not recognize the symptoms in a woman of a heart attack, for instance.</p>
</details>

### 《数字服务法案》的复杂性与内容监管

欧洲《数字市场法案》的复杂性，是你以前从未见过的，它似乎将复杂性提升到了一个新的水平。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the complexities in the European Digital Markets Act which you haven't seen before? It just seems like it's taken complexity to a new level here.</p>
</details>

我认为其中一个困难，对于受影响的企业来说也是如此，是围绕《数字服务法案》的非常政治化的辩论。**数字服务法案**（Digital Services Act: 欧盟旨在规范在线平台、确保网络安全和用户权利的法律）不监管内容。没有欧洲立法规定你可以说什么，不能说什么。这都与各国关于内容的立法有关。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that one of the things that are difficult also for the businesses in scope is the very sort of politicized debate around the Digital Services Act. So the Digital Services Act does not regulate content. There's no European legislation saying you can say this but not that. It all relates with national legislation on content.</p>
</details>

在大多数国家，**仇恨言论**（Hate speech: 煽动仇恨、歧视或暴力的言论）是被禁止的，煽动暴力是被禁止的，招募恐怖分子是被禁止的，当然虐待儿童也是被禁止的，以及交换虐待儿童的照片也是被禁止的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In most countries, hate speech is forbidden, it's forbidden to excite to violence, it's forbidden to recruit to terrorism, it's forbidden to of course abuse children, but also to exchange photographs of children that are being abused.</p>
</details>

《数字服务法案》在欧洲层面所做的是，它规定你必须有一个系统，能够过滤掉在你开展业务的成员国中非法的內容。在这个系统中，你还需要告知人们你的内容已被过滤，以便他们可以对此提出投诉。这是第一项义务。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What the Digital Services Act is doing at the European level is to say you need to have a system so that you can filter out things that are illegal in the member states where you do your business, and in that system you also need to tell people your content has been filtered out so that they can complain about it. That's the first obligation.</p>
</details>

第二项义务是进行横向风险评估，以确定你的服务是否可能对心理健康造成损害，例如，因为它们具有成瘾性设计。我们刚刚处理了一个关于TikTok的案例，他们想推出一个新产品，当你与内容互动时会获得积分。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second obligation is to do a horizontal risk assessment to say, could my services be damaging, for instance, to mental health, because they have an addictive design? We just had a case with TikTok who wanted to launch a new product that would give you points when you interacted with content.</p>
</details>

例如，如果你喜欢视频，如果你看完了整个视频，如果你分享或评论了，你就会获得积分，并且你可以将这些积分用于**电子商务**（E-commerce: 通过电子网络进行商品和服务交易），基本上就是获得一张代金券。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you like the video, if you saw it all to the end, if you shared it, if you commented, you would get points, and you could use those points for e-commerce, so you basically get a voucher.</p>
</details>

我们无法确定他们是否评估过这种可能极具成瘾性的设计，以及他们是否减轻了这些风险。最终，他们没有在欧洲推出这款产品，因为他们无法证明他们确实完成了功课，确保这是一款安全的产品。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we could not get any kind of certainty that they had assessed whether this design, who might be extremely addictive, whether that was the case, and if they had mitigated those risks. And it ended up that they would not launch this product in Europe because they could not certify that they had actually done their homework to make sure that this was a safe product to use.</p>
</details>

### 与大型科技公司合作的挑战与文化差异

与这些大型科技公司合作感觉如何？嗯，这取决于他们的态度，他们有多坦诚，以及他们是否愿意与你进行对话。当你打电话时，他们非常不同，他们有非常不同的文化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is it to work with these big tech companies? Well, it depends on, I mean, how forthcoming are they and how willing are they to engage in a conversation with you when you call? They're very different, they have very different cultures.</p>
</details>

我第一次去**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 美国加州高科技产业聚集地）的**帕洛阿尔托**（Palo Alto: 硅谷城市）是在最近，我去那里是因为我有演讲任务。然后我参观了苹果和谷歌。苹果公司的人们住在那个被大门围起来的、由钢铁和浅色大理石构成的建筑里，那是一个完美的椭圆形。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first time I was ever in Silicon Valley, in Palo Alto, was quite recently. I went because I had a speaking obligation, and then I visited Apple and Google. And Apple, they live in this gated building of steel and sort of pale light marble, a perfect, it's not a circle, it's an oval, I think.</p>
</details>

谷歌当然也有安全措施，但他们没有大门，在一个非常色彩斑斓、低门槛的环境中，这个环境似乎是随着业务的增长而发展起来的。仅仅通过他们通过建筑来展示自己的方式，我认为就足以说明公司的文化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google, they live, of course, they have security, but ungated, in a very colorful, sort of low-barrier environment that seems to have grown as the business has grown. And you know, just by how they present themselves in their architecture, I think tells a lot about the company culture.</p>
</details>

那么，谁最难合作呢？嗯，他们各有各的难处，当然也有各自的魅力。正如你所听到的，苹果总部的建筑也反映出，从小工具、手机本身到操作系统，再到不同的应用程序，你都处于一个**围墙花园**（Wall Garden: 指用户被限制在特定平台或生态系统内的封闭环境）中。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So who is the most difficult to work with? Well, they have their own difficulties, and of course, their own charms as well. As you can hear, the building of the Apple headquarter also reflects that you are a wall garden from the gadget, the phone itself, to the operating system, to the different apps.</p>
</details>

而谷歌的环境则开放得多，你知道，没有谷歌手机，可能是一部三星手机，搭载**安卓操作系统**（Android operating system: 谷歌开发的移动设备操作系统）。所以你会看到这些差异，也体现在他们如何对待监管机构上。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where the Google environment is much more open, you know, there's no, it's not a Google phone, it may be a Samsung phone with an Android operating system. So you see that those differences also in how they approach regulators.</p>
</details>

### 大型科技公司的拆分与国际合作

大型科技公司应该被拆分吗？我认为那将是最后的手段。任何在达到那一步之前可以用来解决问题的方法都应该尝试。
<details>

现在我们有一个关于谷歌广告的案例。非常简短、非技术性的版本是，谷歌拥有广告买家和广告卖家相遇的市场，但他们也拥有广告买家和广告卖家。所以如果你同时拥有买家、卖家和市场，那么你就存在利益冲突。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right now, we have a Google case concerning advertising. The very short, non-technical version is that Google owns the marketplace where those who buy ads and those who sell ads meet, but they also own the ones who buys and the ones who sells ad placing. So if you own the buyer, the seller, and the marketplace, well, then you have a conflict of interest.</p>
</details>

在这里，当我们发出异议声明时，我们说我们很难看到这种利益冲突如何在没有第三方管理其中一部分的情况下得到解决。因此，拆分谷歌生态系统特定部分的做法，当然，如果能以不同方式解决，我们洗耳恭听，因为正如所说，我们有权要求拆分公司，但这将是最后的手段。

<p class="english-text">And here, you know, when we sent the statement of objection, we said we have huge difficulties in seeing how that conflict of interest can be solved without part of this being governed by a third party. So a breakup of this specific part of the Google ecosystem, of course, we're all ears if it can be done differently, because as said, we have the competence to ask for a breakup of a company, but it would be a measure of last resort.</p>

是的，我们也会就事态发展进行更高层面的讨论。这就像是**贸易和技术委员会**（Trade and Technology Council: 欧盟与美国之间促进贸易和技术合作的平台）的一个分支，这个委员会是在本届任期内成立的。我与我的同事维德·布罗斯基在欧盟这边，美国方面是布林肯、雷蒙德和戴琪，他们领导着这个贸易和技术委员会。

### 提升欧洲竞争力：慢速危机与生物技术

当公司说“嘿，欧洲的监管太多了，太复杂了，我们不会推出更多产品，你们的选择会更少”等等，这是一种可信的威胁吗？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when the companies say that, hey, there is too much regulation in Europe, and it's too complicated, we're not going to launch more products, you will have less availability, and so on, is that a credible threat?</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常重要的讨论，因为它指出我们需要做更多的工作来提升欧洲自身的竞争力。在这里，竞争是必要的要素，但它还不够。这是一件棘手的事情，因为我们已经证明能够非常迅速地解决我们面临的生死攸关的危机：疫情、战争、能源危机、通货膨胀。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a really important discussion, because it points to the fact that we need to do more to increase European competitiveness as such. And here, you know, competition is a necessary ingredient, but it's not enough. And it's a tricky thing, because we have shown to solve crises that are questions of life and death in our face, really fast-paced crises: pandemic, war, energy crisis, inflation.</p>
</details>

欧洲现在已经团结起来。而竞争力的危机是一个缓慢的危机，竞争力在多年中被侵蚀，重建需要时间，因为它涉及市场准入、安全的供应链、简化的许可、快速响应的政府部门、获得研发和创新机构的机会，当然还有更好的资本获取。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Europe has come together. Now, the crisis of competitiveness is a slow one, competitiveness being eroded over years. It will take time to rebuild, because it's a question of market access, safe supply chains, easy permitting, authorities who are fast in what they do, access to research and innovation organizations, and of course, better access to capital.</p>
</details>

但是，你通过更多的监管来提高竞争力吗？不，我不这么认为。但有时，例如，如果你看看**生物技术**（Biotech: 利用生物系统、生物体或其衍生物来开发或制造产品和技术的应用科学），欧洲以拥有一些非常重要的生物技术环境而自豪，例如在丹麦、比利时和法国。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do you improve competitiveness by regulating more? No, I don't think so. But sometimes, for instance, if you look at biotech, Europe prides itself in having some very important biotech environments in Denmark, in Belgium, in France.</p>
</details>

这些都是前沿的尖端技术。从创新到市场的时间是竞争力的一个因素。为了加快这一进程，我认为在即将到来的任期内有必要制定一项生物技术法案。因为有时生物技术会陷入一种关于如何监管一种新型化学品的旧式思维中，而这种化学品需要进入市场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cutting edge, front end. It's a factor of competitiveness, the time from innovation to market. And in order to speed that up, I think it's necessary to do a biotech act in this coming mandate. Because sometimes biotech sort of falls into sort of an old-school thinking about how to regulate a chemical, a novel chemical that needs to get to market.</p>
</details>

生物技术是特殊的，它有其特定的特点，它与更传统的化学品的工作方式非常不同。所以在这里，监管实际上是为了让产品更快、更容易地进入市场，而不是设置更多障碍。但监管是必要的，因为否则你就会被其他立法所困，从而使事情变得更加困难。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And biotech is specific, it has its specific characteristics, it works very differently from a sort of a more old-school chemical.

But the regulation is needed because otherwise you would be caught up in other pieces of legislation that would then make things more difficult.</p>

### 人工智能监管与欧洲竞争力

一些美国投资者，如马克·安德森等人曾表示：“听着，我们需要在所有业务中融入人工智能，才能击败中国人。”我们需要将其融入武器、汽车、制药研究等所有领域。那么，通过大量监管人工智能，我们是否在阻碍欧洲与美国和中国竞争的竞争力？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so some American investors, such as Marc Andreessen and so on, have said that, listen, we need to build, we need to stuff AI into everything we do in order to beat the Chinese, right? We need to stuff it into weapons, cars, pharma research, all these kind of things. So by regulating AI a lot, are we holding back the European competitiveness versus America and China?</p>
</details>

嗯，我们现有的法规根本不监管人工智能的研究或基于人工智能的研究。完全放手，没有监管。它并没有说你不能做这个，不能做那个。它说的是，如果你处于一个人们可能被歧视的风险境地，那么你必须采取某些措施。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the regulation that we have does not regulate research in AI or based on AI at all. It's hands off, full stop. There's no regulation. It doesn't say that you cannot do this, you cannot do that. What it says is that if you're in a situation where there is a risk of people being discriminated, then you have to take certain measures.</p>
</details>

所以基本上你可以做很多事情。人工智能法规真正触及你的是在应用场景，即市场创造方面。如果你说：“好吧，我想在我的本土市场验证我的算法，然后才能真正进入全球市场。”那么，例如，欧洲的福利国家是创建值得信赖的人工智能市场的一个明显场所。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically, you can do so many things. It is when it comes to the use cases, so the market creation, that the AI regulation really touches you. And looking at Europe, if you say, okay, I want to prove my algorithm in my home market before I can really go in for in the global market, then, for instance, the European welfare states is an obvious place for a market creation for trustworthy AI.</p>
</details>

你可以在医疗系统、社会系统、教育系统中使用人工智能，因为你可以信任它。你也可以说：“听着，看看我们，我们可以做到这一点，人们信任我们用人工智能所做的一切。”这将是一种创造市场的、对人工智能的使用方法，我认为这也会反映在欧洲之外的一个非常有力的卖点上。

### 银行业：资本市场整合的必要性

科技领域确实存在一些重大问题。现在让我们转向一个稍微简单一点的领域：银行业。在拥有一个竞争激烈的内部市场（一个国家有许多银行）和建立更多全球性“冠军”企业之间，存在哪些权衡？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, for sure some big questions in the tech sector here. Let's move on to something slightly easier: banking sector. Now, one of the trade-offs between having a competitive internal market with many banks in one country or building up a bit more kind of global champions?</p>
</details>

我认为两者兼顾非常重要。存在不同的客户偏好。如果我们有一个统一的**欧洲资本市场**，对欧洲来说会好得多，这也会让银行更容易进行整合。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think it's very important to have both. There are different customer preferences. It would be much better for Europe if we had one European Capital Market, it would also make it much easier for banks to consolidate.</p>
</details>

我们现在正在考虑跨境整合，因为这样更容易获得效率，并确保在更多国家开展业务对你来说确实有利。所以我认为，推动资本市场运作的努力仍然存在，这主要是推动成员国全面取消障碍。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where we now think about that cross-border, because then it would be easier to harvest efficiencies and making sure that it would be actually beneficial for you to be in more countries. So I think the push still for the Capital Market to work, and it's very much a push towards member states to take down in full.</p>
</details>

这是欧洲的立法，欧洲的执法应该取代国家立法和国家执法，因为这样你才能拥有一个完全运作的单一市场，也包括银行业务。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a European legislation, European enforcement should take the place of national legislation and national enforcement, because then you get a full working single market also for banks.</p>
</details>

因为对于大型企业，对于一些庞大的企业集团来说，为了让他们能够与欧洲银行合作，当然需要规模，需要能够扩大规模，需要能够获得全球服务。所以我真的希望我们能够推动这一点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because for big business, for some of the huge conglomerates, in order for them to be relevant to work with a European bank, of course, you need size, you need to be able to scale, you need to be able to get global services. So I really hope that we can do this push.</p>
</details>

**恩里科·莱塔**（Enrico Letta: 意大利政治家，曾任总理）在他的单一市场报告中提出了一个受其启发的测试，旨在通过审视储蓄和投资来推动一个完全运作的资本市场。我认为这两种方法都很好。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is a test inspired by Enrico Letta in his report on the single market to sort of push for a fully working Capital Market by looking at savings and investments. I think both approaches are good.</p>
</details>

当然，重要的是我们要继续消除那些阻碍单一市场充分运作的障碍，包括在银行服务方面，因为这将提供更大的规模化机会。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The important thing is of course that we continue taking down the barriers that disable a fully functioning single market also when it comes to banking services, because that would be that would give greater scaling opportunities.</p>
</details>

但这仅仅是拥有一个单一资本市场的问题吗？因为在银行业，似乎一家银行需要先破产才能被另一家银行收购，对吧？就像我们在瑞士看到的那样，**瑞士信贷银行**（Credit Suisse: 瑞士大型银行）基本上破产了，然后**瑞银集团**（UBS: 瑞士全球性金融服务公司）才能收购它。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But is it a matter of having a single kind of Capital Market, because in banking it seems like one bank needs to go bankrupt before it can be taken over by somebody else, right? Like we saw in Switzerland, Credit Suisse Bank basically went bust before UBS could buy it.</p>
</details>

所以现在欧洲最大的银行，我认为在全球排名第20位。我们基本上没有任何“冠军”企业。我们没有评估过我能记得的银行合并案。我们看到的是银行业的复苏，它曾受到金融危机的严重打击。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the biggest European bank now is I think number 20 worldwide. You know, we basically don't have any champions. We've not assessed bank mergers that I can remember. What we have seen is the recovery of a banking sector which was very heavily hit by the financial crisis.</p>
</details>

我认为在某种程度上，它受到了数字化的挑战，让客户习惯于完全数字化地处理所有银行业务。我认为这可能是导致欧洲从金融危机中复苏所需时间比美国更长的一个因素。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think to some degree challenged by digitization and getting their customers used to do all their banking digitally.

### 能源安全与供应链风险

乌克兰局势之后，我们在欧洲面临天然气供应问题，与**俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司**（Gazprom: 俄罗斯国有天然气公司）有关。你如何评估我们最终陷入这种供应高度集中的局面？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After the Ukrainian situation, we had a gas supply issue in Europe with Gazprom. How do you assess why we ended up in a situation like that, which was so concentrated on the supply side?</p>
</details>

因为便宜。我们想要廉价能源，因为出于显而易见的原因，它作为工业投入非常有效。我认为我们没有意识到获得廉价能源需要付出的代价，而我们付出的代价是我们的安全以及我们邻国的安全。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because it was cheap. We wanted that cheap energy, because for obvious reasons that works very well as an input to your industry. And I think we didn't realize that there was the price to pay to get cheap energy, and the price that we paid was our security and the security of our neighbors.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，这是一个不幸但似乎必要的警钟，我们需要评估我们供应的全部成本，进行公开透明的评估，如果我们要廉价的东西，是否需要支付安全溢价。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that it was an unfortunate, but seemingly necessary wake-up call that we need to assess the full price of our supplies, to have, you know, an open, transparent assessment that if we want things cheap, if there is a security premium to be paid.</p>
</details>

现在我们已经实现了天然气供应的多元化，包括管道天然气和**液化天然气基础设施**（LNG infrastructure: 用于液化、运输和再气化天然气的设施），液化天然气基础设施也得到了非常迅速的建设。所以我们现在有大约10到12个主要供应商可以依靠，这比我们以前的结构健康得多。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now we have diversified the gas supply, both pipeline gas and LNG, and the LNG infrastructure has been built up very, very fast. So we have, I think, 10, 12 prime suppliers to rely on, and that's a much more healthy structure than what we had before.</p>
</details>

这在几年内就发生了，因为显然天然气是一种至关重要的能源投入，并且在未来几年内仍将如此。它的碳排放量低于石油和煤炭，所以它是一种很好的过渡燃料，原因有很多。我认为这是一个很好的例子，表明当面临紧急危机时，欧洲可以迅速行动，就像在这种情况下所做的那样。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That has happened within few years, because obviously gas is a crucial energy input and will remain so for a number of years. It's lower in carbon than oil and coal, so it's a good transition fuel for a number of reasons. And I think it's a very good example of the fact that when faced with an urgent crisis, Europe can move fast, as it has been done in this situation.</p>
</details>

我们是否有可能在电池或太阳能电池板方面陷入类似境地，考虑到我们现在对中国的依赖如此之大？这是一个巨大的风险。我确实希望我们能从我们所看到的**中国策略**（Chinese Playbook: 指中国在特定产业发展中常采用的策略模式）中吸取教训，关于太阳能电池板行业如何在相对短的时间内实际上转移到中国。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a chance that we could end up in a similar situation with batteries or solar panels, given that we are now so dependent on China? That is a huge risk. I do hope that we will learn from what we see as the Chinese Playbook on how the solar panel industry was de facto moved to China within a relatively short time frame.</p>
</details>

这始于中国的合资企业，合资企业被中国接管，中国市场关闭，中国市场成为太阳能电池板产业的建设基地，现在拥有巨大的低成本生产能力，使得欧洲生产商很难甚至不可能具有竞争力。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting with joint ventures in China, joint ventures taking over by China, the Chinese market closing, the Chinese market working as a building ground for a solar panel industry, now with a huge production at very low cost, making it very difficult, if not impossible, for European producers to be competitive.</p>
</details>

我们应该确保这种情况不会发生。例如，如果你看看我们的风能产业，非常重要的欧洲风能生产商正面临来自中国的激烈竞争，他们或多或少地使用相同的策略，但幸运的是还没有那么先进。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we should make sure that this does not happen. If you look, for instance, at our wind industry, very important European wind producers who are faced with fierce competition by the Chinese using more or less the same Playbook, but luckily not so advanced yet.</p>
</details>

所以我认为那将是一个非常重要的关注领域。你可能知道我们有一种叫做**外国补贴条例**（Foreign Subsidies Regulation: 欧盟旨在解决外国补贴对单一市场竞争扭曲影响的法规）的东西。因此，例如，如果我们担心存在不公平竞争，即不是基于竞争性投标，而是基于来自第三国的补贴的投标，那么我们可以进行调查，我们现在正在这样做。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that will be a very important area of concern. You might know that we have something called the Foreign Subsidies Regulation. So we can look, for instance, at tendering if we fear that there has been foul play, so it's not a competitive tender, but it's a tender based on subsidies from third countries, then we can investigate, and we're doing that right now.</p>
</details>

我认为这可能是一种有效的方法，可以确保不公平竞争不会占据主导地位。

### 地缘政治变化与经济安全

自从你接任这份工作以来，地缘政治局势发生了巨大变化。这如何改变了你的思维方式？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's been a massive change in the geopolitical situation since you took over this job. How has it changed the way you have to think?</p>
</details>

如果我举一个例子，我们在容克委员会的最后一年，也就是六年前，制定了一项中国战略，包含三个不同的要素：在应对气候变化方面的伙伴关系、在经济事务上的竞争，以及在治理体系上的对抗。我们是民主国家，我们不认为他们是民主国家。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I should give one example, we made in the last year of the Juncker commission, so six years ago, a China strategy with three different elements: so partnership on fighting climate change, competition on economic matters, rivalry when it comes to the governing system. We are democracy, we do not consider them a democracy.</p>
</details>

在过去一年中，我们看到其中两个支柱——经济竞争和系统性对抗——变得非常紧密，这使得我们更加关注**经济安全**（Economic security: 国家经济免受外部威胁和干扰的能力）。经济安全是系统性对抗和经济竞争成为同一枚硬币两面的答案。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we have seen over the last year is that two of the legs have grown very much together: economic competition and systemic rivalry, which has made us be much more focusing on economic security, which is sort of the answer to the fact that systemic rivalry and economic competition become two sides of the same coin.</p>
</details>

对于经济安全，这是一项非常广泛的努力。它涉及出口管制，但也涉及我们的研发和创新机构是否进行尽职调查，以了解学生、**博士生**（PhD students: 攻读哲学博士学位的学生）是否名副其实，他们来这里的目的是否正确，或者他们是否实际上是来从事所谓的**工业间谍活动**（Industrial espionage: 通过非法手段获取商业秘密或技术信息）或研究间谍活动。

It's about export controls, but it's also about our research and innovation organizations, do they do the due diligence to know if students, PhD students, if they are who they say they are, and if they come here for the right reasons, or if they de facto comes here to do what you could call sort of industrial espionage or research espionage.</p>
</details>

所以，这是一项影响深远的努力，尤其是在许多关键技术领域，例如人工智能、**半导体**（Semiconductors: 介于导体和绝缘体之间的材料，是电子设备的核心组件）、生物技术等许多行业。我认为这是对地缘政治变得比十年前更加敌对这一事实的非常审慎的回应。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's a far-reaching effort, especially in a number of critical technologies, you know, AI, semiconductors, biotech, a number of sectors actually.

当我发现，当我质疑我们的世界秩序时，是如果一个企业，也许是庞大的，也许是小型的，说：“是的，但我不在乎你的规则。”因为如果拥有这种权力的企业变得不守规矩，那么我们就会有问题。我还没有完全看到这种情况，但有时我看到这种趋势，这当然对我们的民主来说是极其令人担忧的。

我发现，你知道，我做的很多工作都基于文字。我听很多，说很多，读很多。所以，用我的双手创造一些东西，以及**纱线**、**羊毛**、**丝绸**、**羊驼毛**（yarn, wool, silk, alpaca: 纺织材料）的感觉，我认为这对我来说是一种非常舒缓、扎实的事情。很遗憾你不能一次穿多件毛衣，因为我相当高产。

It's a pity that you cannot wear more than one sweater at a time, because I'm quite productive.</p>

你读什么书？我读小说。我很少读那种领导力文学，因为既然领导力是关于人的，我发现小说是一种了解我永远不会遇到、没有机会亲近、无法深入了解的人的方式。所以我发现这对我来说非常重要。

<p class="english-text">What do you read? I read novels. It's really rare that I read sort of leadership literature, because since since leadership is about people, I find that a novel is a way to learn about people that I would never ever meet, that I would not have a chance to get close to, I would not be able to get under their skin. So I find that is that is really important for me.</p>

我刚刚读了一本书，我正在读一本芬兰作家**奎斯特**（Kvest）的书，书名是《**Skúr**》（Dusk 41）。我不知道它的英文标题是什么。它发生在第二次世界大战期间，以一个男人和一个女人的视角交替讲述。他们处于一段关系中，这本书非常生动地描绘了历史背景和芬兰在战争中的地理位置，他们经历了如此多的苦难，以及人们如何应对战争。

所以，即使它发生在第二次世界大战期间，它也是对人们如何应对战争的非常感人、深刻的回忆，也包括那些没有直接参战的士兵或没有直接面对战争的人。所以我强烈推荐它。

<p class="english-text">I will order it straight away. Now what advice do you have to young people? I think I think they are in a difficult situation, because they have I think as we all have had the the uncertainty, am I good enough, how do I look, do they see my weaknesses, do I have a social network?</p>
</details>

所有这些都因为许多事情而加速了，而且我认为不幸的是，我们还没有完全摆脱疫情的影响。我认为对于年轻人来说，它已经根深蒂固，而我们成年人已经继续前行。但我认为它在许多年轻人心中根深蒂固。

<p class="english-text">All that has been accelerated and I think on on speed because of a quite a number of things, and unfortunately I don't think that we're done dealing with the pandemic yet. I think for young people it has taken a hold that adults have, we have moved on, but I think it taken a hold in in many young people.</p>
</details>

所以我认为最重要的是说：“你并不孤单。我们成年人在这里支持你，你有朋友，还有其他年轻人也处于同样的境遇。不要认为你孤单一人。我们愿意倾听你，我们愿意帮助你，我们的社会需要你来改变。”即使你感到孤独，有焦虑，有挑战，社会也需要你。我认为这对任何一代年轻人来说都是一个重要的信息。

We we want to listen to you, we want to help you, we rely on you for our society to change. And even if you feel alone and you have anxieties and you have challenges, Society needs you. I think that is an important message to to any Young Generation.</p>
