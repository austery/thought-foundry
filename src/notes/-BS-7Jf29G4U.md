### 加沙停火后的胜利宣言与和平挑战

This long and difficult war has now ended. Some people say it lasted 3,000 years, some say 500 years; whatever its duration, it is the granddaddy of them all.
这场漫长而艰难的战争现已结束。有人说它持续了3000年，也有人说500年；无论如何，它是所有战争的始祖。

You succeeded in doing something that no one believed was possible: you brought most of the world behind your proposal to free the hostages and end the war.
你们成功地做到了没人相信可能的事情：你们让世界上大多数国家支持你们释放人质、结束战争的提议。

One could hear President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu, in their speeches in Jerusalem, reaching to declare victory.
人们可以听到特朗普总统和内塔尼亚胡总理在耶路撒冷的讲话中，都在努力宣告胜利。

This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.
这是一个新中东的历史性曙光。

Trump declared that the war is over, and Netanyahu claimed a victory for Israel over Hamas.
特朗普宣布战争结束，内塔尼亚胡则声称以色列战胜了**哈马斯** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰原教旨主义组织)。

With our military pressure and President Trump's global leadership, we achieved this historic moment.
凭借我们的军事压力和特朗普总统的全球领导力，我们实现了这一历史性时刻。

However, there is no guarantee that this war is fully over.
然而，这场战争是否完全结束，并没有任何保证。

Even though it took months of negotiations, reaching this point may well prove to have been the easy part, and completing the rest of Donald Trump's peace plan from here forward might actually prove a lot harder.
尽管谈判耗时数月，但达到目前这一步很可能只是容易的部分，而从现在开始完成唐纳德·特朗普和平计划的其余部分，实际上可能会困难得多。

David Helfinger, the Times bureau chief in Jerusalem, says that after yesterday's long-awaited return of the last hostages and the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, there's been a huge sense of relief and tears of joy across the region at the break in fighting.
《泰晤士报》驻耶路撒冷分社社长大卫·赫尔芬格表示，在昨天期待已久的最后一批人质返回以及近2000名巴勒斯坦囚犯获释后，整个地区因战斗暂停而充满了巨大的宽慰和喜悦的泪水。

But hanging over all of that are many unresolved questions about what happens next.
但这一切之上，仍悬挂着许多关于接下来会发生什么的未解之谜。

To transition from a ceasefire to actual peace here, both sides have to give up things that they are not ready to do.
要在这里从停火走向真正的和平，双方都必须放弃一些他们尚未准备好放弃的东西。

Hamas is being asked to lay down its weapons permanently.
哈马斯被要求永久放下武器。

For Hamas, which was created as a resistance organization, this is like giving up its ideology or ceasing to exist.
对于作为一个抵抗组织而成立的哈马斯来说，这无异于放弃其意识形态或停止存在。

For Israel, the request is to pull out completely from the **Gaza Strip** (Gaza Strip: 位于地中海东岸的巴勒斯坦领土).
对于以色列来说，要求是完全撤出加沙地带。

Hamas is asking them to do that before Gaza is fully disarmed.
哈马斯要求他们在加沙完全解除武装之前这样做。

The idea that Israel would pull out completely, knowing that Hamas still has weapons, fighters, and tunnels, is hard to imagine them ever accepting.
以色列在明知哈马斯仍拥有武器、战士和隧道的情况下完全撤出，这让人很难想象他们会接受。

Then there are other equally thorny aspects of the way forward.
此外，前进的道路上还有其他同样棘手的方面。

The plan calls for an international stabilization force made up of soldiers from other countries and funded by other countries, while Arab countries are expected to step up.
该计划呼吁组建一支由其他国家士兵组成并由其他国家资助的国际稳定部队，同时期望阿拉伯国家能积极参与。

It is hard to imagine Arab countries sending their soldiers into Gaza to effectively assist the Israelis, lest they be considered an occupying army themselves.
很难想象阿拉伯国家会将士兵派往加沙，以有效协助以色列人，以免他们自己被视为占领军。

Thus, every aspect of the way forward is fraught with peril and pitfalls.
因此，前进道路的每一个方面都充满了危险和陷阱。

### 加沙人道主义援助进展

In Gaza, with the ceasefire in place, the United Nations says it's making "real progress" in getting more aid in to help ease the humanitarian crisis there.
在加沙，随着停火的实施，联合国表示在运送更多援助以缓解当地人道主义危机方面，正在取得“真正的进展”。

It said it has now been able to bring in cooking oil for the first time since March, along with hundreds of thousands of hot meals, tents for displaced families, and medical supplies.
联合国表示，自三月以来首次成功运入食用油，同时还提供了数十万份热餐、流离失所家庭的帐篷以及医疗用品。

The UN estimates that at least 500,000 Gazans will need treatment to address the effects of famine.
联合国估计，至少有50万加沙人将需要治疗以应对饥荒的影响。

### 特朗普政府新关税与住房市场

Now, three updates on the Trump administration. Just after midnight, a new wave of tariffs kicked in that could affect the American housing market.
现在，关于特朗普政府的三个最新消息。午夜刚过，新一波关税生效，这可能会影响美国住房市场。

There is now an additional 10% levy on imported wood and timber, and 25% surcharges on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and bathroom vanities.
现在，进口木材和原木被额外征收10%的关税，软垫家具、厨房橱柜和浴室梳妆台则被征收25%的附加费。

The Trump administration says the tariffs will encourage more furniture manufacturing and logging in the US.
特朗普政府表示，这些关税将鼓励美国更多的家具制造业和伐木业。

But some economists say that for the moment, higher lumber prices could slow the pace of home building and drive up the cost of housing.
但一些经济学家表示，目前来看，更高的木材价格可能会减缓房屋建设的速度，并推高住房成本。

Home prices have already hit record highs this year.
今年房价已经创下历史新高。

### 五角大楼对记者的新限制

Also, the administration has given journalists reporting on the Pentagon a deadline of 5:00 p.m. today to either agree to new restrictions on their coverage or forfeit their press passes.
此外，政府已要求报道五角大楼的记者在今天下午5点前，要么同意对其报道施加新限制，要么放弃他们的记者证。

The 21 pages of new rules put out by the Pentagon reflect Defense Secretary Pete Hgs's adversarial approach to the press corps.
五角大楼发布的21页新规定，反映了国防部长皮特·赫格斯对新闻界的对抗性态度。

They include a number of requirements that lawyers for news outlets say restrict press freedom.
这些规定包含多项要求，新闻机构的律师称其限制了新闻自由。

For example, one provision says that journalists could be deemed a "security risk" if they disclose classified or even unclassified information without Pentagon approval.
例如，其中一项规定指出，如果记者未经五角大楼批准披露机密甚至非机密信息，就可能被视为“安全风险”。

The conservative news outlet ONN has signed on to the policy, but many others have already said they will refuse, including CNN, NPR, Newsmax, The Washington Post, The Times, and The Atlantic.
保守派新闻机构ONN已签署该政策，但包括CNN、NPR、Newsmax、《华盛顿邮报》、《泰晤士报》和《大西洋月刊》在内的许多其他机构已表示将拒绝。

The editor of The Atlantic said, "The requirements violate our **First Amendment** (First Amendment: 美国宪法权利法案的第一条，保障言论、宗教、出版、集会和请愿自由) rights and the rights of Americans who seek to know how taxpayer-funded military resources and personnel are being deployed."
《大西洋月刊》编辑表示：“这些要求侵犯了我们的第一修正案权利，以及美国公民了解纳税人资助的军事资源和人员如何部署的权利。”

### 煤矿工人抗议与黑肺病威胁

Today, in front of the Labor Department in Washington, a group of people will be protesting the administration.
今天，在华盛顿劳工部大楼前，一群人将举行抗议活动反对政府。

It might be surprising to some to see who the protesters are: coal miners.
一些人可能会惊讶于抗议者的身份：煤矿工人。

Lisa Freriedman covers energy policy for The Times.
丽莎·弗里德曼负责《泰晤士报》的能源政策报道。

Just a few months ago, coal miners were standing behind President Trump at a press conference.
就在几个月前，煤矿工人们还在一场新闻发布会上支持特朗普总统。

Trump: "I call it beautiful clean coal. I told my people, never use the word coal unless you put beautiful clean before it."
特朗普：“我称之为‘美丽的清洁煤’。我告诉我的员工，除非在煤字前面加上‘美丽的清洁’，否则永远不要使用‘煤’这个词。”

He announced the ways he planned to reinvigorate their struggling industry.
他宣布了振兴他们陷入困境的行业所计划采取的措施。

Trump: "Beautiful."
特朗普：“太棒了。”

Now, however, they are protesting the monthslong delay of a regulation aimed at protecting miners against a major driver of **black lung disease** (Black lung disease: 一种由长期接触煤尘引起的慢性肺病).
然而，现在他们正在抗议一项旨在保护矿工免受**黑肺病** (Black lung disease: 一种由长期接触煤尘引起的慢性肺病) 主要诱因侵害的法规被拖延数月。

Lisa says that the coal miners protesting today are worried about exposure to toxic **silica dust** (Silica dust: 一种常见矿物结晶二氧化硅的细微颗粒，吸入后可导致严重的肺损伤), which has driven a recent spike in the incurable respiratory disease known as black lung.
丽莎说，今天抗议的煤矿工人担心暴露在有毒的**二氧化硅粉尘** (Silica dust: 一种常见矿物结晶二氧化硅的细微颗粒，吸入后可导致严重的肺损伤) 中，这种粉尘导致了被称为黑肺的这种不治之症近期激增。

When miners cut into rock, silica dust is released into the air.
当矿工切割岩石时，二氧化硅粉尘会释放到空气中。

Because miners in places like Appalachia have already pulled out the most easily accessible coal, they have been cutting deeper and deeper into the rock, exposing themselves to even more silica than previous generations.
由于阿巴拉契亚等地矿工已经开采了最容易获取的煤炭，他们不得不更深入地切割岩石，从而比前几代人暴露在更多的二氧化硅中。

New limits on silica exposure from the Biden administration were supposed to take effect in April.
拜登政府关于二氧化硅暴露的新限制原定于四月生效。

But after a lawsuit from mining industry groups, the Trump administration agreed to delay enforcement.
但在矿业团体提起诉讼后，特朗普政府同意推迟执行。

Lisa Freriedman: "I spoke with a number of miners and their family members who will be in Washington today."
丽莎·弗里德曼：“我今天与一些矿工及其家人进行了交谈，他们将会在华盛顿。”

Lisa Freriedman: "Many of them pointed out to me the enormous assistance that the administration has given to coal mining companies and coal-fired power plants, and they feel that they are not getting the same attention to their health."
丽莎·弗里德曼：“他们中的许多人向我指出，政府向煤矿公司和燃煤电厂提供了巨大援助，但他们觉得自己的健康却没有得到同样的关注。”

Lisa Freriedman: "I spoke with Judith Reef. Her husband was a coal miner in West Virginia who passed away from black lung, and she told me, 'The coal miners have supplied this country with electricity, and now they're just cast aside to die.'"
丽莎·弗里德曼：“我采访了朱迪思·里夫。她的丈夫是西弗吉尼亚州的一名煤矿工人，死于黑肺病，她告诉我：‘煤矿工人为这个国家提供了电力，现在他们却被抛弃等死。’”

In a statement, a White House spokeswoman said President Trump "cares deeply about unleashing America's energy potential, as well as standing up for those who fuel our country."
白宫发言人发表声明称，特朗普总统“深切关心释放美国的能源潜力，并支持那些为我们国家提供动力的人。”

She did not say what the administration plans to do about the silica dust regulation.
她没有说明政府计划如何处理二氧化硅粉尘的监管问题。

### 加州野火保险改革

In California, homeowners who have lost everything in devastating wildfires say they have often had to live through a second trauma: dealing with insurance paperwork to get payouts for what they have lost.
在加州，在毁灭性野火中失去一切的房主表示，他们常常要经历第二次创伤：处理保险文书工作，以获得损失赔偿。

Most fire victims have had to submit exhaustive inventories, sometimes thousands of items long, covering everything from TVs to toothbrushes.
大多数火灾受害者不得不提交详尽的清单，有时长达数千项，涵盖从电视到牙刷的一切物品。

After detailing every single thing, insurers would then decide what the payout would be.
在详细列出每一件物品后，保险公司才会决定赔付金额。

But a new law signed by Governor Gavin Newsom aims to ease that burden.
但由州长加文·纽森签署的一项新法律旨在减轻这一负担。

Under the legislation, Californians will be able to collect at least 60% of their coverage amount without cataloging every item burned in the blaze.
根据这项立法，加州居民将能够领取至少60%的保险金额，而无需列出火灾中烧毁的每一件物品。

That's up from a 30% payout before.
这比之前的30%赔付额有所提高。

There is a cap of $350,000.
赔付上限为35万美元。

Lawmakers celebrated the bill's passage as a win for wildfire victims.
立法者们庆祝该法案的通过，称其是野火受害者的胜利。

They will no longer have to sift through the ashes or dig through old receipts and photos to find ownership of every little thing.
他们将不再需要翻找灰烬，或挖掘旧收据和照片来证明每一件小物品的所有权。

The relief won't be instant, however.
然而，这种缓解不会立竿见影。

The new law takes effect next year and is not retroactive, meaning people who lost homes, like in LA's widespread wildfires this year, are not necessarily eligible.
新法律将于明年生效，且不具追溯力，这意味着今年在洛杉矶大范围野火中失去家园的人们不一定符合资格。

Lawmakers, however, are urging insurance companies to voluntarily adopt the practice now.
然而，立法者们正在敦促保险公司现在就自愿采纳这一做法。

### 快时尚巨头Shein进军实体店遭抵制

Unnamed person: "I think I got about 15 things, maybe 16, I don't really know. And it was about $96."
匿名人士：“我想我买了大约15件东西，也许16件，我真的不知道。而且大约花了96美元。”

Starting a few years ago, the **fast fashion** (Fast fashion: 服装行业中一种快速生产时尚潮流服饰且成本低廉的商业模式) company Shein basically took over the internet, filling social media feeds with cheap knockoffs and influencers showing off their shopping hauls.
几年前开始，**快时尚** (Fast fashion: 服装行业中一种快速生产时尚潮流服饰且成本低廉的商业模式) 公司Shein基本上占据了互联网，社交媒体上充斥着廉价仿制品和网红展示他们的购物成果。

Unnamed person: "It's just this lace."
匿名人士：“就只是这种蕾丝。”

Now, however, the company is trying to make the leap from online shopping to an actual physical store, but it has been a little rocky.
然而，现在该公司正试图从线上购物转向实体店，但过程有些坎坷。

Shein picked Paris, the world capital of fashion, as the site for its first ever brick-and-mortar boutique.
Shein选择了世界时尚之都巴黎，作为其首家实体精品店的选址。

It plans to open in an iconic department store with sweeping views of the Eiffel Tower.
它计划在一家标志性百货公司开业，该店可俯瞰埃菲尔铁塔的壮丽景色。

The store BHV Marais is known for selling French specialty brands.
BHV Marais百货公司以销售法国特色品牌而闻名。

Shein's space there is supposed to open next month, but French lawmakers and the fashion world have responded with a very cold shoulder.
Shein在那里开设的空间原定于下月开业，但法国立法者和时尚界却对其冷淡以待。

BHV Marais's staff walked off the job last week to protest Shein's arrival, accusing the company of using cheap labor and violating environmental and human rights standards at its factories—claims Shein has denied.
BHV Marais的员工上周罢工，抗议Shein的入驻，指责该公司使用廉价劳动力并违反其工厂的环境和人权标准——Shein对此予以否认。

As the home of Chanel, Dior, and other high fashion empires, France, as a country, is already fighting back against fast fashion.
作为香奈儿、迪奥等高级时装帝国的故乡，法国作为一个国家，已经在反击快时尚。

The French Senate recently passed a so-called "anti-Shein" measure that would raise taxes on cheap Chinese clothing.
法国参议院最近通过了一项所谓的“反Shein”措施，将提高对廉价中国服装的税收。

If signed into law, the bill would also ban the company's ads in France and penalize influencers who promote the products.
如果该法案签署成为法律，还将禁止该公司在法国的广告，并惩罚推广其产品的网红。
