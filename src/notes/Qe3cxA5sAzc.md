title: 美联储政策深度解读：为何量化紧缩紧急刹车，扩表或将重启？
summary: 前纽约联储高级交易员 Joseph Wang 深度解析2025年10月FOMC会议。美联储宣布将于12月1日停止量化紧缩（QT），主要原因是回购市场出现压力迹象，为避免重演2019年的利率飙升。Wang 指出，问题的根源在于美国巨额的财政赤字，这导致了对回购融资的巨大需求。他预测，仅停止QT可能不足以控制短期利率，美联储或很快被迫通过购买国库券来重新扩张资产负债表。此外，文章还探讨了美联储内部关于资产负债表最终构成的鹰派观点、央行独立性的辩论以及金融市场的潜在泡沫风险。

### 引言：美联储政策的重大转向

**Jack:** 你曾说过，美联储将开始扩张其资产负债表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You said the Federal Reserve is going to start expanding its balance sheet.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我的猜测是，他们将不得不这样做。否则，他们将失去对**回购市场**（Repo Market: 金融机构之间进行短期借贷的市场，通常以政府债券为抵押品）的控制，而他们不希望那种情况发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My guess is that my guess is that they will have to otherwise they will lose control over the the repo market and they don't want that to happen.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** Joseph，很高兴见到你。欢迎回到《Monetary Matters》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joseph, great to see you. Welcome back to Monetary Matters.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 非常感谢你的邀请。很高兴来到这里，并祝贺你的节目取得成功。过去几个月里请来的嘉宾都非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks so much for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here and congratulations on the success on your show. Such great guests over the past few months.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 谢谢你的夸奖。Joseph，大家知道你在 fedgu.com 上写作，并且你曾是纽约联邦储备银行的高级交易员，那里是大部分货币操作的执行地。刚刚结束的美联储会议上，我们将利率从大约 4.1% 降至了约 3.8%。关于美联储在 12 月会做什么，有很多问题。会降息吗？市场之前预期会降息。但鲍威尔说：“别那么快。”他的原话是，“12 月降息远非定局，远非如此。”对于杰伊·鲍威尔来说，这基本上等于在说“我说话结巴了吗？”这是一个重磅消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Appreciate you saying that. Joseph, obviously you're writing at fedgu.com. You used to be a senior trader for the New York Federal Reserve, which is where, you know, the bulk of the monetary operations go. Just coming out of the Federal Reserve meeting, we had the interest rate cut from 4.1% roughly to to 3.8% roughly. A lot of questions about what the the Federal Reserve is going to do in December. Is there going to be a cut? The market was pricing a cut. Pal said, "Not so fast." Uh his exact words were a cut in December is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it. which for Jay Powell that's basically saying like did I stutter? You know that's a that's a big big bombshell.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 但 Joseph，我想先把利率问题放一放。我们可以在二三十分钟后再深入讨论利率。我想从资产负债表和货币市场开始，这是你的专业领域，也是你在纽约联储时的工作。鲍威尔宣布了一个重磅消息，美联储的缩减资产负债表行动，即**量化紧缩 (QT)**（Quantitative Tightening: 中央银行减少其资产负债表规模的货币政策工具），将实际上于 12 月 1 日结束。请为我们今天的观众分析一下，这件事的重要性是什么？你对具体机制的解读又是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Joseph want to set aside rates for a second. You know the 20 minute 30-minut mark we we'll talk more about rates. Want to start out with the balance sheet and money market which is your expertise. That's what you were doing at at the New York Fed. Powell dropped a big announcement that the Federal Reserve's reduction in its balance sheet or quantitative tightening QT is going to be effectively over on December 1st. So break this down for our audience here today. what's the significance of it and what's your interpretation of the the specific mechanics?</p>
</details>

### 为何美联储紧急叫停量化紧缩？

**Joseph:** 首先，我会谈谈他们为什么停止 QT，然后我会讨论一个更重要的问题，即未来美联储资产负债表的最终构成会是怎样，因为这才是真正会产生市场影响的部分。一段时间以来，美联储一直在通过 QT 缩减其资产负债表。当他们缩表时，他们实际上是在缓慢地从金融系统中抽走流动性。他们希望确保其资产负债表的规模恰到好处，以便银行体系有足够的现金来运作。银行在美联储持有存款，这些存款被称为**准备金**（Bank Reserves: 商业银行存放在中央银行的资金，用于满足提款需求和清算）。这就是他们考虑的重点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, I'll talk a little bit about why they start they're stopping QT and then I'll talk about the much more much bigger question that is what the final composition of the Fed's balance sheet is going to be going forward because that's the part that's actually going to have a market impact. So, the Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet through QT for some time. And when they shrink their balance sheet, what they're doing is they're solely withdrawing liquidity out of the financial system. Now they want to make sure that their balance sheet is just small enough so that the banking system has enough uh cash to function. Now a bank holds deposits at the Fed. They're called reserves. So that's what they're thinking about.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 问题在于，美联储实际上并不知道其资产负债表的合适规模是多少，或者换句话说，银行系统需要多少准备金。他们有模型之类的东西，但归根结底，他们并不真正知道。上一次他们进行 QT 时，他们不断缩减资产负债表。结果在 2019 年 9 月，回购市场出现了剧烈的利率飙升，迫使他们进行干预。美联储认为，当时回购市场出现巨大飙升的原因之一是他们 QT 做得过头了。所以，他们现在非常急于避免这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the problem is that the Fed doesn't actually know what the right size uh well right size for their balance sheeting is or another way of saying this is how many reserves banking system needs. Now they have models and so forth but at the end of the day they don't really know. Now, the last time they did QT, they kept shrinking their balance sheet. And in September of 2019, there was a tremendous spike in the repo market that forced them to intervene. Now, the Fed thinks that one of the reasons why there's that huge spike in the repo market back then was because they overdid QT. So, they're very eager to avoid that right now.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 因此，当他们审视自己是否缩表过度时，他们会关注市场利率，特别是短期融资市场的利率，比如回购利率和联邦基金利率。在过去几个月里，我们看到**逆回购工具**（Reverse Repo Facility, RRP: 美联储用来吸收金融体系中过多流动性的工具，主要面向货币市场基金）的余额已经缓慢下降，现在基本接近于零。逆回购工具基本上是货币市场基金存放其过剩现金的地方，美联储将其视为金融体系中过剩流动性的一个储存库。当该工具的余额降至零时，回购利率开始逐渐走高。在过去几周，回购利率的交易价格已经高于联邦基金利率和准备金利率。这向美联储发出了一个强烈的信号：也许我们应该停止 QT 了。这就是主席鲍威尔今天提到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, when they're looking at whether or not they're shrinking their balance sheet too much, they look at market rates, specifically market rates in short-term funding markets like repo rates and the federal funds rate. Now, over the past few months, what we've seen is that uh the reverse repo facility balances have gone down slowly and now are basically around zero. So reverse repo facility is basically a place where money market funds park their excess cash and the Fed looks at it as kind of a repository of excess liquidity in the financial system. So when that facility went to zero repo rates began to gradually drift higher and over the past few weeks they've traded higher than Fed funds and higher than interest on reserves. That sends a strong signal to the Fed that you know maybe we should stop doing this QT and that's what Cher Powell mentioned today.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 实际上，QT 在过去几个月里已经逐渐缩减规模了，所以在市场上已经不再是什么大事。但他们今天指出，将从 12 月起正式停止。这就是他们在资产负债表方面所做的重大决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now QT has actually uh been tapered over the past few months. So it's really not a big deal in the market anymore. Uh but they noted today that they're going to stop it effective December. So that's kind of the big thing they did with their balance sheet.</p>
</details>

### 财政赤字：回购市场压力的真正根源

**Joseph:** 从我的角度来看，当我观察回购利率时，并且考虑到美联储喜欢关注这一点，如果你在美联储工作，你能做的最重要的事情之一就是必须控制短期利率。因为这是你调整政策的方式，对吧？你试图通过调整短期利率来调节更广泛市场的金融状况，并影响实体经济。所以，你的看家本领就是能够控制短期利率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now from my perspective when I look at repo rates and since the Fed likes to focus on this, if you're at the Federal Reserve, one of the most important things you can do is you have to control short-term interest rates because that's how you adjust policy, right? you're trying to toggle short-term interest rates to adjust the financial conditions through the wider uh market and impact the real economy. So, your bread and butter is being able to control short-term interest rates.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 回购利率是这个复杂体系的一部分，它和其他任何事物一样，由供求关系驱动。可用于回购借贷的资金供给，部分与美联储资产负债表的规模有关，这一点是肯定的。但需求方面，则主要是因为美国有 2 万亿美元的财政赤字。最终，一些购买国债的人会在回购市场为这些购买行为融资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, repo rates are part of that complex and it's driven by supply and demand like anything else. Part of the supply of funding available to lend and repo is related to the size of the Fed's balance sheet. That's that's definitely true there. But the demand though, that's largely because the United States runs a 2 trillion fiscal deficit and at the end of the day, some of the people who buy the Treasury debt finances those purchases uh in the repo market.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这是必要的，因为假设你正在发行 2 万亿美元的债务。比如说，你是美国财政部，你来到市场上，卖出 100 亿美元的国债。大多数人不会有那么多现金躺在沙发底下或口袋里。所以你需要有人能够弹性地扩张其资产负债表，也就是通过杠杆购买。因为如果你用杠杆购买，你可以立即获得资金，对吧？你不必依赖于投资者的资金流入或保险客户支付的保费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's kind of necessary because let's say that you're issuing $2 trillion in debt. Let's say that you you're you're um you know the US Treasury, you show up to the market, you sell like 10 billion. Most people don't have that lying uh you know under a couch or in their pocket or something like that. So you need someone who's be able to elastically expand their balance sheet. So buy that on leverage because if you buy it on leverage you get the money instantly, right? You don't have to rely on you know inflows from your investors or premium payments from your uh insurance people who buy insurance from you.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以最终，在现货国债市场中，为美国财政部融资的大量购买行为都是在回购市场获得资金的。随着国债发行量巨大，对回购的需求也随之增加。因此，美联储现在停止缩表，认为这将对回购利率产生影响。但归根结底，只要财政赤字持续增长，对回购资金的需求就会不断增加，利率也就会走高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at the end of the day uh a lot of the purchases in the cash treasury market uh to finance the US Treasury are funded in the repo market and as you have tremendous uh issuance demand for repo increases. So the Fed right now they're stopping their balance sheet thinking that you know this is this is going to have an impact on uh repo rates but at the end of the day as long as the fiscal deficit continues to grow you have increasing demand for repo funding. And so rates are going to go higher.</p>
</details>

### 下一步：美联储或将重启扩表

**Joseph:** 所以我的预期是，他们很快就必须向金融体系注入流动性。他们可以通过几种方式做到这一点。这次与过去不同的一点是，他们有一个叫做**常备回购便利工具 (SRF)**（Standing Repo Facility: 美联储设立的一个常设机制，允许合格的交易对手方在需要时以美国国债等为抵押向美联储借款）的东西。这意味着，如果你是一家证券交易商，你基本上可以随时去美联储借入回购资金。他们一直在这样做，但规模不大，而且显然不足以抑制回购利率。这背后可能有一些技术原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So my expectation is that uh they're going to have to be adding liquidity into the financial system shortly. And they can do this in a couple ways. One thing that's different this time compared to the past is that they have something called a standing repo facility. And what that means is that uh if you are a securities dealer, you can go and borrow from the Fed uh in borrow repo from the Fed basically anytime you want. and they've been doing that but really not a lot and also obviously not enough to constrain the repo rates and there are probably technical technical reasons for that um with regard to</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这非常技术性，但如果你使用 SRF，你是在三方回购中借款，这对资产负债表不友好，因为它不可净额结算。所以我认为这是部分原因。但他们未来可能会做的是，一旦他们意识到停止 QT 并未对回购利率产生下行压力，一旦他们看到回购利率继续上升，他们可能会大量购买短期国库券（bills）以向金融系统注入流动性。他们称之为“准备金管理购买”，他们在 2019 年也这么做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay super in the weeds but if if you're an SRF you're barring in triparty repo and that's not balance sheet friendly it's not netible and so I think that's part of reason uh but what they're likely to do going forward is once they realize that stopping QT uh does not put downward pressure on repo rates. Once they see rep rates continue to rise, they're probably going to be buying a lot of bills to add liquidity into the financial system. They call these reserve management purchases and they did that in 2019 as well.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这种情况可能最早在 12 月就会发生。这些事情真的很难说，因为其中很多是不透明的。就像 2019 年 9 月回购市场的利率飙升，来得有点突然。我当时就在那里，那情景还挺刺激的。所以我预计他们很快会再次扩张资产负债表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that could happen actually maybe as soon as December. I mean it's really hard to say about about these things because so much of it is uh opaque. Um like the spike in repo markets in September 2019 came kind of out of the blue. I I was there at that time. It was kind of exciting. Um so I I expect them to be expanding their balance sheet again shortly.</p>
</details>

### 资产负债表的最终构成：鹰派的长期博弈

**Joseph:** 不过，这其实是相当技术性的问题。真正会影响未来市场的大局是美联储资产负债表的最终构成。这一点很重要，因为美联储通过其资产负债表影响市场定价的方式，是通过调节私营部门的国债供求关系。例如，如果美联储出去购买大量 10 年期国债，那么私营部门可获得的国债就减少了，对吧？供应减少，利率就会降低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you know that that's actually pretty technical. The really really big picture that's going toffect impact markets going forward is just what the ultimate composition of the Fed's balance sheet will be. Now, that's kind of important because the way that the Fed impacts market pricing through their balance sheet is through the supply and demand of Treasury securities to the private sector. So, if the Fed, for example, is going out and buying a bunch of 10ear treasuries, there's less treasury treasuries available for the private sector, right? Less supply, uh lower lower interest rates.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 目前，美联储的投资组合**久期**（Duration: 衡量债券价格对利率变化敏感度的指标，久期越长，利率风险越大）相当高，远高于整个市场。这是有意为之的。他们购买所有这些国债，就是为了对长期利率施加下行压力。所以他们吸收了大量的久期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, right now, the Fed has a portfolio whose duration is pretty high, much higher than the overall markets. That's by design. They bought all these Treasury securities because they wanted to put downward pressure on longdated interest rates. So, they swallowed out a whole bunch of duration</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 现在在**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会，负责制定美国货币政策的机构）内部，他们仍在讨论这个问题。但根据我们听到的消息，以及从几位理事那里得到的信息，他们对资产负债表的态度将相当鹰派。例如，理事沃勒（Waller）希望持有的短期国库券数量与准备金余额相当。这将意味着大幅增加数万亿美元的短期国库券。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the FOMC right now, and this is something they're still discussing. But from what we've heard, and we've heard from a couple governors right now, is that they're going to be pretty hawkish on the balance sheet. Uh, Governor Waller, for example, would like to, you know, maybe just hold uh, you know, hold a lot more Treasury bills, as many Treasury bills as they have reserve balances. So, that'd be upping it significantly by over a couple trillion.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这意味着什么呢？如果你必须持有，比如说，三万亿美元的短期国库券，那就意味着你持有的长期债券（coupons）会减少，也就意味着私营部门将不得不持有更多的久期。所以，这是一种超级鹰派的立场，因为它会增加市场上的久期供应。也许他们会逐步这样做，这真的取决于委员会里有谁。另一位成员，理事鲍曼（Bowman），甚至建议美联储应该直接出售**抵押贷款支持证券 (MBS)**（Mortgage-Backed Security: 将多笔住房抵押贷款打包后出售给投资者的金融产品）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what does that mean? Well, if you're holding uh, if you have to hold, let's say, three trillion bills, that means you're going to have to hold fewer coupons, and that means that the private sector is going to have to hold a lot more duration. So, you know, that's kind of uh super hawkish um in that it will increase the supply of duration to the market and maybe they'll do that solely and really depends on uh who's on the committee. Another member uh Governor Bowman has actually even suggested that the Fed should outright sell mortgage back securities.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 如果你出售 MBS，市场就必须吸收它们，这意味着更高的抵押贷款利率。这可能会带来相当大的破坏性，而且我认为这会让白宫的很多人不高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I mean that's going to be, you know, so if you sell mortgage back securities, the market's going to have to absorb it. that means higher mortgage rates and uh you know that's that that could be potentially pretty disruptive and uh I think it's going to make a lot of people in the White House unhappy.</p>
</details>

### 鹰派理事与降息呼声：解读美联储内部的政治动态

**Joseph:** 但听着，到目前为止我从中得出的结论是，那些在资产负债表问题上非常鹰派的人，恰恰是特朗普任命的官员，也就是过去几次会议中一直大声呼吁降息的同一批人。所以我认为这表明，美联储可能仍然作为一个相当独立的组织在运作。我指的是理事鲍曼和理事沃勒，因为他们是最近几个月里一直要求降息的人，甚至不惜投下反对票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But listen, I think what I've taken away from this so far is that the people who have been very hawkish on the balance sheet uh have been the Trump appointees, the same people who have been clamoring for rate cuts over the past, you know, few meetings. So I think that suggests that maybe there's there's the Fed is still functioning as a you know pretty independent organization. I'm just talking about Governor Bowman invol and governor uh Waller because they were the people who have been climbing for rate cuts in the past recent month going so far as to descent.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 有一种说法是，所有这些人因为是特朗普任命的，所以他们只会降息，听老板的话。但是，他们在资产负债表上的言论却非常鹰派。所以我认为情况比那种说法要复杂得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a narrative out there that all these guys because they're Trump appointees that they're just going to you know cut rates and do what the boss says. But, uh, what they're saying with the balance sheet is very hawkish. So, I think that it's it's more complicated than that narrative.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 所以，我稍后会回到资产负债表的问题上，但你的意思是，特朗普总统在美联储理事会中任命的官员，在资产负债表问题上并没有表现出超级鸽派、完全听从总统意愿的态度。这与他们在利率问题上听从总统意愿的说法恰恰相反。你如何评估这种说法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I'll get back to the balance sheet in a second, but what you're saying is that the President Trump appointees on the Federal Reserve Board are uh uh they are not being super dovish and doing whatever the president wants on the balance sheet. Counter to the narrative that they are doing whatever the president wants on the interest rate story. How are you evaluating that narrative?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我再补充一点。在 2019 年，美联储有一份机密备忘录，后来被解密公开。备忘录中说，如果我们对资产负债表采取更鹰派的立场，长期利率将会上升，这样我们就可以在前端进行更多的降息。我的感觉是，这些特朗普任命的官员并非只是想取悦大老板，而是在玩一种非常政治化和圆滑的手腕：他们给予总统想要的降息，但另一方面又通过在资产负债表上采取更鹰派的立场来抵消其效果。最终你会得到一个更陡峭的收益率曲线，但对经济的影响大致相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what I'll just add one more thing here. So in in uh the in 2019 the Fed had a confidential memo that was subsequently declassified to the public and in that memo they said that you know if we were more hawkish on the balance sheet longer dated interest rates would go up and we could cut more on the front end. And my sense is that rather than you know these these Trump appointees just you know trying to please the big man uh they are being very political and diplomatic in that they are giving the president the rate cuts he wants but on the other hand taking it away by being more hawkish on the balance sheet. So you end up with a steeper curve but the impact on the economy is about the same.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以我认为这才是美联储内部正在发生的事情。看起来美联储还没有完全成为行政部门的一部分。未来几年可能会，也许应该会，我不知道，但现在还不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think that's actually what's happening at the Fed. So it doesn't seem like the Fed is uh completely uh part of the executive uh just yet. Probably will be in the coming years and maybe it should be. I I don't know, but not yet.</p>
</details>

### 利率前景：十二月降息并非定局

**Joseph:** 现在谈谈利率部分，我认为我们应该先设定一个基准。上次美联储会议，我们看到了点阵图，它预示着今年还会有两次降息：今天一次，十二月一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now on the interest rate part, I think we should kind of level set a little bit. So the last time we had a Fed meeting, we had the dot plot and the dot plot guided towards two more cuts this year. So a rate cut today and a rate cut in December.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 从那时到现在，由于政府关门，情况变得很困难。美联储基本上是在“盲飞”，没有收到很多通常用来指导决策的重要数据。当然，他们确实可以接触到像 ADP、Adobe 这样的私营数据，并且他们有自己的内部网络，可以去和人们交谈，并据此撰写褐皮书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, between then and now, it's been a difficult time because of the government shutdown. The Fed has been basically flying blind, not receiving a lot of the important data that would usually inform their decisions. Now, they do have access to private data like ADP, like Adobe data, and they have their own internal network where they go and they talk to people and they write the Beechbook about it.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 在这段时间里，通胀数据似乎比预期的要好一些，但最终仍然在 3% 左右。劳动力市场依然缓慢，步履蹒跚，招聘和解雇率都很低，没有什么变化，但也没有恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now between then and now it seems like the uh well inflation has come in a little bit better than expected but at the end of the day it's still around 3%. And the labor market still, you know, kind of slow, trudging along, low hiring, low firing, not doing anything there, but not deteriorating.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 在今天会议之前，市场完全定价了今天一次降息和十二月一次降息。但鲍威尔公开反驳了这一点，令市场感到意外。我认为他那句令人难忘的话是“并非定局”，强有力地暗示他可能不会在十二月降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And heading into today, the market was fooling pricing in one cut today and one cut in December. But the papa surprised the market by just openly pushing back against that. I think his memorable words were not a foregone conclusion, forcefully suggesting that maybe he's not going to cut rates in December.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这背后的理由似乎是劳动力市场没有像预期的那样恶化，而且如果你看看那些 GDPNow 的即时预测，看起来经济增长还不错。所以这就导致了市场不再完全定价十二月的降息，也许真的不会降。我认为这就是我们目前在利率问题上的处境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the rationale for that seems to be that the labor market is not deteriorating as much and if you look at these GDP now casts it looks like growth is you know growth is okay so that leads us to and you know not fully pricing in a December cut maybe it won't be there and that I think that's where we are in rates right now</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 所以，进入今天之前，市场完全定价了十二月的降息，但现在这个降息的可能性被大大削减了。所以利率市场已经改变了。有趣的是，当鲍威尔说十二月降息“并非定局”时，标普 500 指数下跌了约 76 个基点，但后来又收复了大部分失地。这表明我们已经不在 2022 年了。当年杰伊·鲍威尔的鹰派言论能导致股市一天下跌 2%、3%、4%，并引发了 2022 年的大熊市，那些日子已经过去了，至少目前是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so going into today there there was fully priced as you said that there would be a cut in December that cut has been taken away a good chunk of those odds. So the interest rate market has changed. Interesting when Powell said that not a foregone conclusion about December. You know the market stock S&P was down around 76 basis points regained a lot of that. So just goes to show we are not in 2022 anymore and you know the days of Jay Powell's hawkishness causing the stock market to decline two three 4% in a day and you know a large bare market in 2022 was we were not in that day. we not those those days are over you know um at least at least so far.</p>

### 回购市场压力与美联储的应对

**Jack:** Joseph，我想回到资产负债表和你最初的评论。自 2022 年年中以来，美联储一直在抽回流动性，资产负债表从 8.9 万亿美元降至约 6.5 万亿美元，减少了 2.2 到 2.3 万亿美元的流动性。这是一个漫长、缓慢且相对稳定的过程。这个过程还将持续 30 到 32 天，但将于 12 月 1 日结束。届时，到期的国债将被持续再投资，从而保持稳定。美联储拥有的抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）在到期时，将被再投资于短期国库券。所以，美联储的总资产将保持平稳，但其构成将发生变化，MBS 将在到期时被转换为短期国库券。这本身也是一种紧缩形式，对吗？因为 MBS 具有更长的久期和凸性风险，而用几乎没有风险的短期国库券来替代它，相当于你向私营部门增加了 MBS 的供应。所以这仍然是某种形式的紧缩，对吧？

<p class="english-text">Joseph want to get back to the balance sheet your your first comment. So the Federal Reserve has been withdrawing liquidity since the middle of 2022. Um just $8.9 trillion to around $6.5 trillion. So you know 2.2.3 trillion of liquidity removal balance sheet uh reduction. And it's been a a long and slow and somewhat steady process. That process is going to go on for 30 to 32 more days, but it is going to end on December 1st. And the uh the treasuries are going to just constantly be reinvested. So held steady. The mortgage back securities that the Federal Reserve owns are going as they mature, they are going to be reinvested into Treasury bills. So the aggregate balance sheets, the Federal Reserve's assets are going to stay flat, but the composition is going to change and mortgage back securities are going to basically be converted as they mature into Treasury bills. That itself is kind of a form of tightening, right? Because mortgage back securities have more duration and convexity risk and just replacing, you know, treasury bill has almost no risk at all. So you're you're supplying the private sector with an increased uh mortgage back security. So it's it is still somewhat a form of tightening, right?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 嗯，我想指出的是，美联储持有的 MBS 票面利率非常低，所以它们不会很快被提前偿还。MBS 的本金偿还方式有两种：一是每月按期支付本金，这需要 30 年；二是通过再融资，即借一笔新贷款来偿还旧贷款。由于美联储是在疫情期间利率极低时购买的这些抵押贷款，它们的利率大约在 2.5% 到 3% 之间，没有人会去申请一笔新贷款来偿还它们。所以美联储每月收到的本金还款额非常低，大概每月 140 到 150 亿美元。因此，我认为这不会产生大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I would point out that mortgage back securities that the Fed holds have very low coupons. So they're not going to prepay quickly. So someone who so mortgage back securities get paid down either monthly as principal payments go go go through and that takes 30 years or if someone refinances their mortgage that is to say takes out a new loan to repay the old loan. Now because the Fed bought these mortgages during the very low interest rates of the pandemic uh these are like you know 2 and a half 3% mortgages and no one's going to u you know take out a new mortgage to repay that. So the monthly principal payments that the Fed is receiving each month, it's really low. It's like, you know, say 14 15 billion a month. So it's I don't think it's going to have a big impact.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 不过，关于抵押贷款组合，美联储希望其资产负债表上没有任何抵押贷款。它希望最终的投资组合全部是国债。其理由是，他们认为持有抵押贷款基本上是美联储向私营部门分配信贷，而他们不想这样做，尽管他们已经这样做了很长时间，而且规模巨大，对吧？他们的资产负债表上有几万亿美元。所以，如果他们想转向一个纯国债的投资组合，他们可能需要等上 30 年。那太久了，你不会设定一个目标然后花 30 年去实现它。所以，他们有可能通过出售抵押贷款来加速这一进程。我认为这非常不可能，那将是一个非常鹰派的结果。我们以前没见过他们这样做。放眼全球，英格兰银行曾通过直接出售来缩减资产负债表，但通常大家只是让它们自然到期。所以这是一种可能性。我认为这是今天发生的一件有趣的事情：抵押贷款本金将被再投资于不仅仅是国债，而是短期国库券。鲍威尔指出，这是减少其整体投资组合久期的努力的一部分，但同样，这个过程会非常缓慢和微小，不会有实质性影响，我不认为它会影响市场。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh but but when it comes to the mortgage portfolio though, the Fed would like to have no mortgages on its balance sheet. It wants to have a final portfolio that's old treasuries. The rationale for that is that they feel that owning mortgages is basically the Fed allocating credit to the private sector and they don't want to do that even though they've been doing that for for quite some time and to an enormous enormous size too, right? They have a couple trillion under balance sheet. So if they wanted to go to an old Treasury portfolio, uh they probably have to wait 30 years. Now that's a long time and you don't really set goals and just take 30 years to achieve them. So there is a possibility that they could try to speed that up a little bit by selling mortgages. I think that's really unlikely. It'd be a very hawkish outcome. We haven't seen them do that before. Uh looking across the world, the Bank of England has uh shrink their balance sheet by by selling outright, but uh usually people just let them roll off. So that that is a possibility. So I think that's a that is one of the interesting things that happened today. mortgage principal principal is going to reinvest it in not just treasuries but treasury bills and Paul noted that's part of the effort to reduce the duration of their overall portfolio but again it's going to be so slow and and so minor it's not going to be meaningful I don't think it'll affect the market</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 现在让我们把资产负债表和回购市场联系起来。正如你所说，美联储的逆回购工具（作为美联储的负债）规模一直在缩小，现在实际上已经为零。所以，停放在美联储的过剩现金已经被部署到金融系统中，因为财政部增发了大量短期国库券，而这些国库券被那些曾经投资于逆回购工具的货币市场基金购买了。现在，它们正在向对冲基金放贷，而这些对冲基金则通过信贷购买国债，杠杆率高达 10 倍、50 倍、100 倍，我甚至听说过 200、300、400 倍的杠杆，在所谓的**基差交易**（Basis Trade: 一种套利策略，通过同时买入现货资产（如国债）并卖出其对应的期货合约来获利）中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and now let's connect the balance sheet to repo as you said the Federal Reserve's reverse repo facility which are liabilities of the Federal Reserves has been shrinking down and are now effectively at zero. So the excess cash parked at the Federal Reserve has been deployed into the financial system as the Treasury has increased a lot of Treasury bills that have been bought by the money market funds that were buying um the the uh that were investing in in the repo facility. Um and and so now they are lending to hedge funds who are now buying the treasuries on on credit you know 10 50 100 times levered um I've heard 200 300 400 times levered um in the in the so-called basis trade</p>
</details>

**Jack:** Joseph，粗略地讲，2000 年到 2010 年，美国的赤字和增发的国债很大程度上是由外国人（很多是中国）提供资金的。2010 年到 2022 年，则是由美联储、国内银行、家庭和企业来融资。现在，正如你在 fedgu.com 上指出的，国债融资的很大一部分来自对冲基金。它们就像银行一样通过杠杆购买国债，但它们是在回购市场借钱，从货币市场基金那里借钱。结果，正如你所说，借款需求是无穷无尽的。所以回购利率正在小幅飙升。正如鲍威尔今天指出的，过去三周，出现了一些我称之为“压力”的迹象，**SOFR**（Secured Overnight Financing Rate: 有担保隔夜融资利率，基于美国国债回购市场交易的利率，是衡量短期借贷成本的关键指标）利率比美联储的利率高出 10 到 20 个基点。而且，即使是本应是世界上最普通的有效联邦基金利率，也比应有水平高出 3 到 5 个基点。所以，货币市场正处于压力之下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so Joseph you know broad painting painting with a very broad brush the US deficit and US increased treasury issuance from 2000 to 2010 bought was funded a lot by foreigners a lot of which were China let's say 2010 to 2022 was financed by the Federal Reserve in yeah a ton but also domestic banks, domestic households, domestic corporates. A lot of the financing of the treasury and you know you've pointing this out on fedgu.com has been now from the hedge funds. So it's it's levered like a bank buying treasuries, but they're borrowing in the repo market and they're borrowing from money market funds and as a result the demand for borrowing as you say is insatiable. So the the repo rates are spiking and ever so slightly. So, you know, as Powell noted today, over the past three weeks, there have been elevated signs of I'll call it stress where sofur rates are 10, maybe 20 basis points above the the Federal Reserve rates. And, you know, I'll go both for the New York Fed as well as your website to get the exact data, but uh even the effective federal funds rate, which is supposed to be the most vanilla rate in the world, is like three to five basis points above where it should. So, stress is in the the money markets.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 请把这一切联系起来，为我和观众解释一下，因为我真的需要你的专业知识。另外，在你最近在 fedgu.com 上发表的关于“资产负债表主导”的文章中，你谈到美联储如何因日益增长的财政赤字而失去对其资产负债表政策的控制。也请解释一下这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tie this all together. explain this to me as well as to the audience because I I really need your your expertise here. And then also uh expl you know in on your uh your most recent piece on fat.com balance sheet dominance you talk about how the Federal Reserve is losing control of its balance sheet policy to the growing fiscal deficit. Explain explain that as well.</p>
</details>

### 财政主导：美联储失去对资产负债表的控制

**Joseph:** Jack，你刚才对正在发生的事情描述得非常好。美国财政部发行大量债务，边际买家在回购市场融资。目前，正是这些进行基差交易的人在融资，他们买入国债，卖出股指期货。因此，在当前的配置下，只要财政赤字增长，对回购融资的需求就会更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well well Jackie you you actually had a really good description on what's happening. US Treasury issuing a lot of debt. The marginal buyer of that debt finances in repo at the moment it's these guys who are financing it uh buying treasuries selling treasury futures and their basis trade and so as long as the US as in this current configuration as long as the fiscal deficit grows there's going to be more demand for repo financing</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 需求持续增长，那么资金供给呢？我们已经耗尽了所有货币市场基金的资金，现在边际贷款人是商业银行。因为回购利率高于准备金利率，一些商业银行很乐意将它们在美联储的存款拿出来，转而投放到回购市场。但它们持有的现金也不是无限的，所以最终它们也会耗尽现金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay demand continues to grow what about the supply of funds well we exhausted all the money market funds and right now the marginal lenders are the the commercial banks and Because repo rates are trading above interest on reserves, you have some commercial banks that are happily taking money that they have on deposit at the Fed and lending it in repo instead, but they're the amount of cash they have is is not unlimited. So eventually they're going to run out of cash, too.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 因此，回购利率将继续走高，甚至可能飙升。如果你是美联储，你必须控制短期利率。这意味着你承诺要持续向金融体系注入流动性，以保持这些短期利率在控制之下。而这就意味着你失去了对资产负债表的控制，因为通过钉住利率，你失去了对数量的控制。这就是这里的设定方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so repo rates will continue to go higher and maybe spike. If you're the Fed, you have to control short-term interest rates. So, that means you're committed to continuing to add liquidity into the financial system to keep these short-term interest rates under control. And that means you lose control of your balance sheet because by pitting rates, you you lose control over quantities. You that's just how this is set up here.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这似乎就是我们过去几年一直在玩的游戏，只是我们没有看到。当美联储在 2019 年首次失去对短期利率的控制时，他们通过购买短期国库券增加了大量准备金。然后到了 2020 年，他们简直是倾其所有，向金融系统注入了数万亿美元的流动性。但我们已经把那些都用光了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that seems to be the game we've been in actually the past few years. We didn't see it. So when the Fed first lost control over short-term interest rates in 2019, uh they added a whole bunch of uh reserves by buying by buying Treasury bills and then we had 2020 where they just kind of threw in the kitchen sink and you know increase the amount of liquidity in the financial system by by trillions. But we've burned through all that.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以我们又回到了 2019 年的境地，你必须不断增加流动性，否则你就会失去对短期利率的控制。我认为，这是他们面临的一个有趣的困境，他们真的无路可走。因为对于一个中央银行来说，能够控制短期利率是绝对至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh we're back to where we are in 2019 where you have to just keep adding otherwise you'll lose control for short-term interest rates. So, that's kind of an interesting, I think, conundrum they have. They really have no way out of it. Uh because it is absolutely essential for a central bank to be able to control short-term interest rates.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 是的，为了强调这一点，如果美联储在其声明中将利率降至零，但市场上的实际利率仍在 4%，那么他们就毫无控制力可言。那就像你或我在播客上说利率是 0% 一样，毫无意义。重要的是市场上实际发生的情况。99.9% 的时间里，美联储对这些短期利率有近乎完美的控制，但你开始看到差异，这些利率正在上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And just to underscore that point, like if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to zero on its statement, but actual interest rates in the market are still at 4%. Then they have no control whatsoever. Like they're basically that's like if you or me on a podcast said interest rates are 0%. It's it's what actually happens in the market. And, you know, 99.9% of the time, the Federal Reserve has close to perfect control over these short-term interest rates, but you're starting to to see a discrepancy where those those interest rates are are going up.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 我从纽约联储和你那里得到的数据显示，SOFR 相对于 OBFR 的利差现在已经扩大到 10 到 15 个基点。所以回购利率正在边际上升。有趣的是，现在是季度的正中间，而不是像 6 月 30 日那样，所有银行都在撤回回购融资，以便在季度报告中向投资者和监管机构展示漂亮的账面。现在完全没有“橱窗粉饰”的因素。而这些回购利率却在大幅上升。你认为这真的是促使美联储做出“砰，12 月 1 日，我们停止量化紧缩”这个决定的原因吗？另外，请解释一下鲍威尔谈到的那个框架，关于准备金稀缺性的框架。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I have the the data from the New York Fed and from you that the the uh sofur over the OBFR over overnight something you you could explain it is uh now 10 to 15 basis points wide. So, those repo rates are going up marginally. And interestingly, we're it's it's in the middle smack riddle smack in the middle of the quarter. It's not like it's June 30th and all the banks are pulling out, you know, they're they're repo financing to make it look good for investors and and regulators for their quarterly reporting. This is, you know, there's no window dressing at all. Um, and these these repo rates are going up a lot. Is do you think this is what really drove the Federal Reserve to make this decision of boom, December one, we are stopping quantitative tightening? And also explain the framework. Powell talked about that framework. Um maybe it was Roberto Pley's thing. I know this from you. Talk about that that framework for reserve scarcity.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 是的，我认为那个框架来自 Roberto Pley。Roberto 是 SOMA（System Open Market Account）的经理。Roberto 或他的团队设计了一个非常有趣的图表，我记得像是一个六边形或八边形，有不同的角，用来衡量金融系统中的流动性何时变得稀缺。他会看一些指标，比如联邦基金利率对准备金变化的敏感度如何？回购利率有多高？银行是否为了保存流动性而在一天中延迟支付？日内透支是否增加等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's from Roberto. Roberto is the solo manager. So Roberto or his team came up with a really interesting graph. I think it's like a hexagon or octagon or something like that that has different corners trying to measure out when uh liquidity in the financial system is scarce. So he'll look at things like how sensitive is the Fed funds rate to changes in in reserves? How high are repo rates? uh let's say uh are pe are banks holding back their payments throughout the day trying to conserve liquidity uh is there increased uh let's say you know intraday intraday overdraft things like that uh so that's kind of the indicators it look</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 看起来他们审视了所有这些指标，并得出结论：是的，回购利率远高于准备金利率，这不是好事。我不想让 2019 年 9 月的情况重演，所以我要在 12 月 1 日停止。这就是目前资产负债表 QT 故事的结局。Jack，我想我们已经经历过 QE 和 QT 的整个周期了，对吧？所以我们又回到了几年前的原点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but it looks like they looked at all those and decided that yes indeed report rates trading far above IR that's not good I don't want September of 2019 to re to reoccur again so I'm going to stop it uh in December 1st So that's the end of the balance sheets QT story for now. Jack, I think we've been through a QE and QT before. This is like the entire cycle, right? So we're right back uh back back uh back to where we were a few years ago, I guess.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 你认为美联储会开始扩张其资产负债表吗？我想你已经回答了“是”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And do you think the Federal Reserve I think you already said yes, you I think you said the Federal Reserve is going to start expanding its balance sheet.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我的猜测是，他们将不得不这样做。否则，他们将失去对回购市场的控制，而他们不希望这种情况发生。我认为他们误解的一点是，回购利率上升不是因为准备金稀缺，而是因为你有一个巨大的财政赤字需要通过回购来融资。如果不关注需求端，你就会被误导，最终陷入像 2019 年那样回购利率再次飙升的境地。希望他们能再次意识到这一点，因为犯两次同样的错误会非常尴尬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My guess is that my guess is that they will have to otherwise they will lose control over the repo market and they don't want that to happen. So I think what they misunderstand is that you know de repo rates rise not because reserves are scarce but because you have a tremendous tremendous fiscal deficit that's financed and repo and without paying attention to the demand side of that uh you are going to uh be misled and end up in a situation where repo rates do once again spike like they did in 2019 and hopefully they'll realize that be again because it would be very embarrassing to make the same mistake twice.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 他们将如何扩张资产负债表？他们会自己购买国债吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And how are they going to expand their balance sheet? Are they going to be themselves buying treasuries?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 是的，他们会购买短期国库券。很多人认为美联储扩张资产负债表就是 QE，就是宽松政策，但美联储不这么看。美联储对 QE 的看法是特定的，即他们从市场上抽走久期。所以他们购买长期国债，使得私营部门持有的长期国债供给减少，从而对利率施加下行压力。从这个角度看，当美联储购买短期国库券时，这是中性的，不会对市场产生影响，尽管很多人会这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, they'll buy Treasury bills. So, a lot of people think that the Fed expanding their balance sheet is QE and it's easing, but that's not how the Fed looks at it. So, the Fed looks at QE in a specific way that they're taking duration out of the market. So, they're buying longerdated uh Treasury securities. So the private sector has less of a supply and longerdated Treasury securities putting downward pressure on interest rates. Now from this perspective when the Fed is buying Treasury bills which are shortdated, it's it's neutral. It's not having an impact on the market even though many people will perceive it as such.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以这可能是他们将开始做的事情。我怀疑他们必须这样做，而且规模还不小。因为如果你看几件事：一是财政赤字，每年大约两万亿美元。第二件事是回购交易量的增长。现在 SOFR 的交易量每年增长 8000 亿美元。这告诉你，对杠杆回购融资的需求是巨大的。那些现金从哪里来？所以看起来你可能每年需要扩张你的资产负债表几千亿美元才能满足所有这些需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's probably what they'll begin to do. I suspect they'll have to do it I I think in size too because if you look at how well you look at a couple things. One is you look at the fiscal deficit. It's two trillion a year roughly speaking. The second thing you want to look at is the growth in repo volumes. Now silver volumes grew 800 billion a year. So that's telling you that you know there's a tremendous demand for leverage repo financing. Where is that cash going to come from? So it looks like you're probably going to be have to add well expand your balance sheet by a few hundred billion a year to be able to to meet all that demand.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 这很复杂，因为一旦你向系统注入流动性，有人借走它，它最终会到另一个人手中，也许又可以被再次借出。所以这些效应如何循环和抵消，很难说。但我认为规模肯定会在几千亿美元的范围内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
p class="english-text">So it's complicated because once you you let's say that you add liquidity in the system, someone lends it and it ends up into someone else's hands and maybe it can be relent again. So how these thing these effects actually circulate and net out it's hard to say. Uh but it's definitely going to be I think in a few hundred billion range.</p>
</details>

### 市场观察：泡沫、情绪与外国投资风险

**Jack:** 你现在如何看待股市？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you, Joseph. How are you thinking about the stock market right now?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 显然，我们正处于一个巨大的泡沫之中，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, we're in a huge bubble, right?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 是的，显然，一切都只涨不跌。当我观察股市时，它让我想起过去几周黄金的走势。你进入一个阶段，价格直线上升，看起来像是要进入抛物线式上涨，然后突然就下跌了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, obviously I mean things only go up. Everything goes up. So when I look at the stock market, I it kind of reminds me as to how gold traded the past few weeks, right? You go into a period where you just go straight up, straight up, screw up, look like you're going parabolic, and then suddenly you decline.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我感觉，当我们看市场时，我们正在进入这样一个阶段，似乎股票只会涨。我注意到，当有坏数据时，“哦，这意味着要降息了”，市场上涨。当有好数据时，“这意味着经济很好”，市场上涨。有很多人涌入，只是在追逐势头。他们有很多不同的叙事，但归根结底，人们买入只是因为市场在上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I feel like when I look at the markets, we're entering this phase with it it seems like it we stocks only go up. I've noticed that when we have, you know, bad data, oh that means rate cuts, market go up. If you have good data, that means the economy is good, market go up. And there's a lot of people pouring in here just chasing momentum. They have a lot of different narratives, but at the end of the day, you know, people are just buying because the market goes up.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 而且这种策略一直很有效。我觉得当你处于市场的这个阶段时，很难说它能涨多高。也许它真的会遵循互联网泡沫的蓝图，涨到任何人都无法想象的高度。但最终，它很可能会伴随着急剧的下跌。这让我有点担心，因为经济如此依赖于财富效应。如果我们真的经历了某种形式的冲顶回落，随之而来的是下跌，那几乎保证我们会陷入衰退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's been working very well. And I I think feel like when you're in this phase in the market, you can it's hard to say how high you can go. You know, maybe you really just follow the com blueprint and go higher than anyone imagined. Uh but at the end of the day though, it's most likely followed by a sharp uh decline. And that worries me a little bit because so much of the economy is dependent upon the wealth effect. if we do actually go have some kind of blowoff top and afterwards we have a decline that almost guarantees us to be in a recession</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 不仅如此，我认为从另一个角度看，有太多人基本上整天就在市场上买东西。我去咖啡馆，看到一位和蔼的老先生坐下来，打开他的笔记本电脑，我以为他在看孙子的照片，但实际上，他在画 K 线图，试图弄清楚什么时候买，什么时候卖。这里真的成了一个投机国度。通常来说，这些人中的大多数都会亏钱。我认为这会让很多人感到不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and not just that I think from a there's so many people who have basically just spending their day just buying stuff in the market right I go to a a cafe I see this nice old man sit down open his laptop I think he's looking at photos of his grandkids but actually he's you know he's drawing candles and trying to figure out you know when to buy and when to sell so it's really very much a speculation nation here. And usually speaking, most of these guys, they lose money. And I think that's going to upset a lot of people.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我理解总统喜欢股市上涨，喜欢在上涨时邀功。这肯定会让人们喜欢他，但是，如果你在上涨时邀功，那么在下跌时你就会被指责。所以，这可能不是非常明智的做法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, I understand the president likes the stock market higher, likes to claim credit when it goes higher. It's definitely making people like him, but you know, if you take credit on the way up, you will get blamed on the way down. So, that may not be super wise.</p>
</details>

### 央行独立性的大辩论

**Jack:** Joseph，让我们谈谈央行独立性的问题。如果特朗普总统任命的人都在呼吁降息，而这正是总统想要的，那将意味着美联储不再独立。这是行政部门、政府的强大影响。特朗普总统自己也说过：“我认为我应该对利率有发言权。”这等于在宣称他不相信央行独立性。这是我的解读。很多人都这么看。第一，你认为这是否偏离了央行独立性？第二，你认为这是一件坏事吗？我想很多经济学家都认为这是坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well Jose, I guess let's just talk about this issue of Federal Reserve independence. You know, if President Trump is appointing people who are going to be calling for interest rate reductions, which the president wants, that would be a Federal Reserve that is no longer independent. That is a strong influence um by by the executive branch by by government. And you know, President Trump himself has said, "I think I should have a say about interest rates." That's kind of declaring that he doesn't believe in central bank independence. That's my interpretation. a lot of people view number one do you think that that is a a departure from central bank independence number two do you think that that is a bad thing which you know I'd say a lot of economists think is a bad thing</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 显然，总统希望设定利率，哪个总统不希望呢？关于央行独立性，我想说的是：我认为央行独立性可以是一件非常好的事情，因为我们处在一个政治过程中，行政部门总是希望有更低的利率来暂时提振经济。我们看到尼克松就是个例子，他试图降低利率以增加选举胜算，之后我们可能会有通货膨胀，但嘿，反正我不用再竞选连任了。所以我认为这是人们担心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so obviously the president would like to set interest rates what president doesn't right so I'll say this about central bank independence now I think central bank independence can be a really good thing because we are in a political process where know the executive would always like to have lower interest rates to temporarily boost the economy And we've seen that happen with Nixon, for example, trying to get lower interest rates, boost his chances in the election, and then afterwards, you know, maybe we have inflation, but hey, I'm not up for re-election anymore. So, I think that's the fear there.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 但这很清楚地告诉你一件事，那就是中央银行从来都不是真正独立的。它总是在民选政府的框架下运作。自 1950 年代以来，我们在美国有一个独立的中央银行。然而，我们确实发生了尼克松那样的事件，现在也正在发生这样的事件。所以中央银行是由人组成的，他们总是在政治约束下运作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But that tells you one thing very clearly in that a central bank is never really independent. It's always operates under uh the elected government. So, we've had an independent central bank in the US since the 1950s. And yet we did have that episode happen with Nixon and we have this episode happening right now. So central bank is composed of people and they always operate under uh political constraints. So that's one thing.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 但更广泛地说，如果你放眼全球，比如说英国和法国，他们直到 1990 年代才实现央行独立。这并不是因为他们经历了一大堆通货膨胀，立法者最终说：“我们再也受不了了，我们必须给予央行独立性。”而是在实现独立之前，他们的通胀率一直很低，他们只是决定改变制度，可能只是为了与其他国家保持一致。所以即使没有央行独立性，你仍然可以有低通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But more broadly speaking though, if you look across the world, so let's say that you have central bank independence in the UK and France, they didn't get that until the 1990s. And it wasn't because they had a whole bunch of inflation and finally the legislator said, "We can't take this anymore. we got to give our centric independence. It was they were having you know low inflation leading up to the independence and they just decided to change the system probably just to you know uh get in line with what other people are doing. So even without central bank independence you can still have low inflation</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 你甚至可以看看中国，它有一个非常复杂的管理经济体。他们没有央行独立性，但仍然保持着低通胀。所以，你可以有央行独立性但仍然得到通货膨胀，你也可以没有独立的央行但有低通胀。所以它既不是必要条件，也不是充分条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you can even look across the world uh to China which has a you know very complicated managed economy. They don't have central bank independence and they still have low inflation. So you can have a central bank independence and still get inflation and you can not have an independent central bank and have low inflation. So it's not necessary and it's not sufficient.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我要说的最后一点，我认为更重要，那就是今天的中央银行与过去的中央银行非常不同。今天的美联储超级强大，比以往任何时候的中央银行都要强大。你不仅有利率政策，还有资产负债表政策，你可以去购买数万亿美元的抵押贷款支持证券，把抵押贷款利率压得超低，让整整一代人今天被挡在房地产市场之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is but the last point that I'm going to make is I think it's more important and that the central banks today are very different from the central banks in the past. Today the Fed is super super powerful much more powerful than the central bank has ever been. you not only have interest rate policy, you have balance sheet policy where you can go and buy you know trillions of mortgage back securities, get mortgage rates super low, uh make uh you know a whole generation of people locked out of the housing market today.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 当然，你还有对银行的监管权力，可以控制谁能获得信贷。在一些国家，他们可以利用这一点确保贷款流向绿色项目。所以今天的中央银行超级强大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course you also have regulatory power over banks whereas you can control who gets access to credit. You know maybe uh in some countries they could do this uh make sure that loans are given to green endeavors for example. So a central bank today is super super powerful.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 尽管我应该指出，美联储已经放弃了这一点，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Although the Federal Reserve has abandoned that I should note, right?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 是的。但我只是以美联储为例。欧洲央行也同样超级强大。总的来说，今天的中央银行比过去强大得多。当你审视当今社会的政治问题时，最紧迫的问题之一就是住房所有权，对吧？一大群人买不起房子，因为房价上涨了，部分原因是抵押贷款利率低。当然还有财富不平等。拥有金融资产的人过得很好。我们有一个 K 型经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. But you know I'm just talking about central the Fed as an example. So the ECB also super powerful as well. Central banks in general today are much more powerful than they are in the past. And when you look at the political issues today as a society, the one of the most pressing ones is like home ownership, right? a whole bunch of people can't afford homes because a whole bunch of people uh well home prices have gone up in part because mortgage rates are low and of course it's wealth inequality. People who own financial assets well they're doing pretty well. We have this K-shaped economy.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以，我们社会中一些最重要的分配问题，基本上是由坐在中央银行的一小群人决定的。如果你相信我们应该有一个民主社会，那么在我看来，公众对那些对社会有巨大分配影响的事务拥有一些发言权是合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So some of the most important distributional things in our society are basically determined by a a small group of people sitting at the central bank. So if you believe that we should have a democratic society, it seems to me that it makes sense for the public to have some say in matters that have huge distributional impacts on the society.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以你可以提出这样的论点：因为今天的中央银行比过去强大得多，它们必须减少独立性。或者你可以削弱它们，也许将监管权分离出去，也许让它们只负责单一任务，即只管通货膨胀等等。所以，是的，我认为你可以提出一个很好的论点，即中央银行过于强大，不能没有任何形式的民主发言权。我认为这是一个你可以提出的论点。所以从我的角度来看，说美联储不应该独立，并不是完全不合理的。我理解这是一个政策决定，有利有弊。这不仅仅是“哦，天哪，我们有独立的中央银行，这些人会非常聪明智慧，一切都会好起来的。”世界不是这样运作的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So you can make the argument that because central banks today are much more powerful than the past, they have to be less independent or you could pair them down, maybe separate regulatory power out, maybe make them single mandate, inflation only and so forth. So uh yeah I think you can make a good argument that uh central bank is too powerful to not have any kind of democratic say simply you know so I think that's an argument you can make and so it's not super unreasonable for from my perspective uh for you to say that uh maybe the Fed shouldn't be independent and I understand that um you know it's a it's a policy decision right there they're there pluses and minuses it's not just oh my god God, we have independent central bank, these guys would be so wise and smart and everything will be okay. That's just not how the world works.</p>

### 银行业新格局：从传统放贷到非银金融

**Jack:** Joseph，你的网站 fedgu.com 上有一张非常出色的图表，关于一个我很高兴在《Monetary Matters》上多次讨论的问题：商业银行向**非银行金融机构 (NBFI)**（Non-Bank Financial Institution: 指那些提供金融服务但没有银行牌照的机构，例如私人信贷基金）的贷款。银行发放的大量工商贷款实际上在一夜之间消失了，因为它们被重新归类为对非银行机构的贷款。所以，银行向公司或工厂放贷的旧模式已经过时了。现在，银行是向私人信贷公司或**业务发展公司 (BDC)**（Business Development Company: 一种投资于中小型或陷入困境的公司的上市封闭式基金）放贷，然后由这些公司发放贷款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joseph, you got this phenomenal chart uh on an issue I've actually you know been pleased to cover a lot on monetary matters. The commercial bank loans to non-bank financial institutions. a huge amount of loans, commercial and industrial loans that banks were making actually, you know, disappeared overnight because they were reclassified as loans to non-banks. So, the old model of a bank lends to a company or an industrial facility, a factory, that's kind of out the window. Now, the bank is lending to a a private credit company or a business development company. Uh, and then those companies make the loan.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** 你可以说银行降低了风险，它处于一个更优先的位置。但是，银行越来越不直接向实体经济放贷了。我最近参加一个会议，数据显示，银行贷款的 9% 到 10% 是贷给非银行金融机构或非存款性金融机构的。你认为这有什么重要意义？你认为这在任何方面让美联储的工作变得更困难了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the banks you could say is derisks. It has a more senior position. But uh you know increasingly banks are are not really lending to the economy. Um and I was actually at a conference so you know this data is recent that uh like nine to 10% of bank loans are to non-bank uh financial institutions or non-depository financial institutions. Uh what do you think is the significance of this and do you think it makes in any way the Federal Reserve's jobs harder?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 不，这让美联储的工作容易多了，因为它降低了银行业的风险。过去，如果你是一家银行，你会贷款给一家公司，那里会有一些风险。现在，如果你是一家银行，你会贷款给一个私人信贷基金或某种私人投资者。他们通常是来自像贝莱德（BlackRock）这样备受推崇的大型资产管理公司的团队。然后这些人再拿钱去贷款给其他公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it makes the Federal jobs much easier because it derisks the banking sector. In the past, you if you were a bank, you would lend to a company and you know, you'd have some risk there. Now, what you do if you're a bank, you lend to a a private credit fund or some kind of private investor. They're usually teams of people from very highly regarded companies, you know, your big asset managers like a like a Black Rockck or or something like that. And then those guys then take the money and they lend to other companies.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 假设那家公司违约了，会发生什么？嗯，私人信贷贷款人会处理它。当私人信贷基金耗尽了他们的资源，这才成为银行的问题。所以，银行在它们和最终借款人之间有了一个额外的层次，将它们与信用风险隔离开来。这就是他们这样做的原因，因为风险更小，所以成本更低。银行向非银行金融机构发放那笔贷款所耗费的资本，比直接向最终借款人放贷要少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's say that the company has a default. What happens? Well, uh the private credit lender deals with it. And when the private credit fund has exhausted their resources, then it becomes the bank's problem. So, the bank has this extra layer between them and the ultimate borrower that insulates them from credit risk. And that's the reason why they do it because it's uh from a because there's less risk. It's cheaper. There's less it it costs the bank less capital uh to make that loan uh to the NBFI than it is to the ultimate borrower.</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 所以我们有了这个基本上从商业银行部门获得融资，然后再贷款给实体经济的影子银行部门。这让美联储的工作变得更困难，因为它不太清楚钱的去向，但它让银行系统更安全。我认为这才是美联储真正关心的。因为当银行系统崩溃时，会影响到每一个人。当你有一些在阴影中的私人信贷基金倒闭时，它们是不可交易的，所以不会在市场上引起恐慌。而且也没有人在那里有存款。它们从富有的个人等处借款，但这不像是一个影响广大公众的系统性事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have this basically this shadow banking sector that gets his financing from the commercial banking sector and then lends it to the real economy. So it makes the Fed's job more difficult in that it doesn't really know where the money goes, but it makes the banking system safer. And I think that's really what the Fed cares about. Uh because when the banking system fails, you know, that affects everyone. When you have some private credit fund in the shadows that fails, you know that they're not tradable. So they don't really cause panic in the market. And also no one has deposits there. I mean they borrow from wealthy individuals and so forth, but it's not like a systemic event that impacts the broader public.</p>
</details>

**Jack:** Joseph，你最后有什么要补充的吗？你认为未来几周和几个月，你会关注美联储的哪些动向？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um, all right, Joseph, can you just give us just a a brief overview of where do you think the the what do you what what are you going to be tracking for the Federal Reserve over the coming weeks and months?</p>
</details>

**Joseph:** 我认为今年的趋势更多地是关于白宫和人工智能公司发生的事情，而不是美联储。所以，不幸的是，作为一个美联储观察者，它已经不那么重要了。但如果你要关注美联储，那将是关于美联储资产负债表的最终构成。他们是否真的会显著缩短其久期，以及他们会多快实现这一目标。他们是否会真的通过出售证券来达到他们的最终构成？这就是我未来几个月会关注的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the trend this year is less about the Fed, more about what happens with the White House and the AI companies. So, unfortunately, as a Fed watcher, it's just not that important. But if you were to focus on the Fed, it will be about the ultimate composition of the Fed's balance sheet. Whether or not they really will significantly shorten their duration and how quickly will they get there. Will they actually sell securities to get to their final composition? Uh that's what I would be looking for in the next few months.</p>
