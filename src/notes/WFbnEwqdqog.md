### 欢迎与主题介绍

大家好，我是Anthony。欢迎来到我的频道。在前两期视频中，我们讨论了**NTR**（Netorare: 日语“寝取られ”的缩写，指伴侣被他人夺走并与之发生性关系的一种性幻想）幻想及其背后的心理状态。我相信大家会发现，我们的分析并不仅限于这个特定案例，更多是通过这个案例揭示了一种普遍的精神结构。正如我们在上期视频中所说，当我们深入分析某种性幻想时，我们也能从各种新兴的亚文化中看到相似的背景。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, I'm Anthony. Welcome to my channel. In the first two videos, we discussed NTR fantasies and the psychological state behind it. I believe everyone will find our analysis is not limited to this particular case, but more through this case to reveal a universal spiritual structure. As we said in the last video, when we analyze a certain sexual fantasy in depth, we can also learn from the various subcultures that emerge and see similar backgrounds.</p>
</details>

所以，今天我们要谈论另一种网络亚文化，那就是**男娘**（指生理性别为男性，但在外表和姿态上高度女性化，甚至符合女性刻板印象的个体）文化，或者说**女装文化**（指男性通过穿着女性服装来表达自我或满足特定幻想的文化现象）。这同样揭示了人们精神世界中，尤其是在**无意识**（Unconscious: 精神分析理论中指个体意识之外，但影响其行为和思想的心理活动和内容）层面，一种相当精妙而复杂的机制。本期视频，我们将尝试分析这背后的逻辑。我将把这个视频放入“心理学与教育”的列表中。如果您有任何想与我讨论的咨询话题，可以通过我的邮箱进行预约。

<p class="english-text">So, today we are going to talk about another online subculture, that is, effeminate culture or women's clothing culture. This also shows the spiritual world of people, especially at the unconscious level, a rather delicate and complex mechanism. This video, let’s try to analyze the logic behind this. I will post this video, put it in the list of "Psychology and Education". If you have anything you want to discuss with me and consultation topics, you can contact my email to make an appointment.</p>
</details>

### 男娘文化：定义与群体分类

在我们深入分析之前，首先需要一个清晰的定义：我们今天讨论的“男娘文化”究竟是什么？这个词本身就非常复杂，因为它模糊了传统的性别界限。“男娘”指的是那些生理性别为男性，但在外表和姿态上高度女性化，甚至更符合女性刻板印象的个体。他们通常会使用精致的妆容、高度女性化的服装和特定的肢体语言，来突出可爱和性感的特征，例如白皙的皮肤、纤细的腰肢、可爱的表情、性感的姿势，以及白色或黑色的丝袜等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before we dive into the analysis, first, a clear definition is needed: what exactly is the sissy culture we are discussing today? The word itself is complex, because it blurs traditional gender boundaries. "Nanny" refers to those who are biologically male, but in appearance and posture, they are highly feminine, even individuals who are more consistent with female stereotypes. They often use exquisite makeup, highly feminine clothing and specific body language to highlight the cute and sexy characteristics, such as fair skin, slender waist and cute expression, sexy poses, white or black stockings, etc.</p>
</details>

因此，虽然他们扮演的是女性，但他们想要观看和扮演的女性，与其说是一个真实的女性，不如说是一个满足男性欲望的完美女性符号。这与真实的女性相去甚远，它是一个高度编辑过的女性形象，过滤掉了真实女性的复杂性，只保留并放大了作为男性欲望客体的功能。这就像**色情电影**（Pornographic Film: 旨在引起性兴奋的视觉作品）中的女演员一样，她们扮演的并非真实的女性，而是基于男性幻想构建的形象，其原理是相同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, although I am playing a woman, but the women they want to watch and play, it's better to say it's more, is a perfect female symbol that meets men's desires. He and real women don't have much in common. It's a highly edited image of a woman. He filters out the complexity of real women, only retain and enlarge, function as an object of male desire. It's like an actress in a porn movie. The actresses she plays are not real women. It's the same principle.</p>
</details>

男娘文化所涵盖的群体，尽管身份多样，但他们无疑都是男性。我们可以大致将其分为三类：首先，是少数将男娘作为公开社会身份的男性，例如一些主播和网红。这个群体的人数当然非常小。其次，是私下的幻想者或扮演者，也就是说，拥有女装幻想，或只在私人空间或小圈子里实践女装的男性。这个群体的人数当然比第一类要大得多。第三，是匿名消费者，这也是最大的一个群体。他们通过互联网和其他渠道，观看和消费与男娘相关的图像、视频和文化产品，并从中获得性满足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The groups covered by the male-girl culture, although the identities are diverse, but they are undoubtedly men. We can roughly divide it into three categories. First of all, a minority, men who use sissy as a public social identity. For example, some anchors and internet celebrities. This group is of course very small. The second is the private fantasist or actor, that is to say, having a fantasy of wearing women's clothing, or only in private spaces or small circles, men who practice cross-dressing. The number of people in this group, of course it's much bigger than the first one. The third is anonymous consumers. This is also the largest group. They use the Internet and other channels, watching and consuming images related to male sissies, video and cultural products, and obtain sexual satisfaction from it.</p>
</details>

我们暂时不深入探讨第一类群体。这不仅因为他们的比例非常小，更因为将幻想变为现实并作为公开社会身份的行为动机，往往混杂了经济、职业发展等实际因素。我主要想分析后两类人群，也就是那些秘密渴望成为女娘的人，以及匿名消费者。因为他们没有将自己的欲望或幻想付诸行动，反而更能体现幻想的纯粹性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We will not delve into the first group for now. This is not only because their proportion is very small, it's because of turning fantasy into reality and as a public social identity, their behavior motivations are often mixed with economic, career development and other practical factors. I mainly want to analyze the latter two groups of people, that is, a person who secretly desires to be a woman, and anonymous consumers. Because they don't express their desires or fantasies, put it into action, instead, it can better reflect the purity of fantasy.</p>
</details>

### 为什么分析纯粹的幻想？

为什么在**精神分析**（Psychoanalysis: 弗洛伊德创立的心理学理论和治疗方法，旨在通过探索无意识来解决心理冲突）中，分析纯粹的幻想比分析实际行动更有意义？因为幻想是一个人内心最原始、最直接的蓝图。而行动，永远是这个蓝图与现实妥协后的结果。一个人在幻想中可以无限接近他无意识欲望的核心，他可以毫无顾忌地打破所有禁忌，反正无需付出任何代价或成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why in psychoanalysis, analyzing pure fantasy is more meaningful than analyzing the actual actions? Because fantasy is the most primitive thing in a person's heart, the most direct blueprint. Action, it is always the result of a compromise between this blueprint and reality. A person in fantasy, infinite access to the core of his unconscious desires. He can break all taboos without restraint, anyway, there is no price or cost.</p>
</details>

但当他即将把幻想付诸行动时，就必须考虑现实的各种限制。例如，他的外貌是否允许？他的经济状况是否支持？社会环境会惩罚他吗？他人的凝视会带来什么后果？所有这些现实因素都会迫使他修改、删除，甚至扭曲自己最原始的幻想。这些妥协和噪音会阻碍他内心欲望最真实的表达。因此，通过分析最纯粹、未受现实污染的幻想蓝图，我们能更清晰地看到驱动一切的最根本欲望结构和心理问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when he was about to put his fantasy into action, we must consider the various limitations of reality. For example, does his appearance allow? Does his financial situation support it? Will the social environment punish him? What consequences will the gaze of others bring? All these realistic factors will force him to modify and delete, even distorting your most primitive fantasy. These compromises and noise, it will block the most genuine expression of his inner desires. Therefore, by analyzing the purest, a fantasy blueprint untainted by reality, we can see more clearly what drives everything, the most fundamental desire structure and psychological problems.</p>
</details>

### 男娘视频的类型与凝视的作用

那么，男娘文化反映了怎样的心理**症状**（Symptom: 精神分析中指无意识冲突在意识层面上的表现）呢？在B站上，你可以看到很多男娘或带有“女装大佬”等关键词的视频。我认为这些视频大致可以分为两类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then the masculine culture, what kind of psychological symptoms does it reflect? We are on station b, you can see a lot of male girls or videos with keywords like "cross-dressing guy". I think these videos can be roughly divided into two categories.</p>
</details>

第一类是单纯介绍和记录女装生活的视频。例如，这类视频的标题可能是“男生坚持穿女装一年，会发生什么？”“高跟鞋使用指南”等等。这类视频满足了男性观众的**窥淫癖**（Voyeurism: 通过观察他人隐私行为获得性满足的心理倾向）和好奇心。它只是提供了表面的信息，观众不会投入其中，仅仅是一个纯粹的观察者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Category 1, this is a video that simply introduces and records women's clothing life. For example, the title of this video is "Boys insist on wearing women's clothes for a year, what happens?" "Guide to using high heels" and so on. This type of video satisfies the male audience's voyeurism and curiosity. He just provided a superficial information. The audience will not leave, just a pure observer.</p>
</details>

第二类视频是情景剧视频。例如，“当我叫兄弟们出去上网，而我穿女装会发生什么？”“你的室友女装回家会是什么反应？”或者“室友回家以为是男生，别想睡了”或者“女装出门拿外卖被搭讪”等等。这类视频不仅记录了男娘生活的细节，而且能让观众轻松代入场景中的某个角色，比如路人、室友、陌生人等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second type of video is a situational drama video. For example, a title like "When I called my brothers to go out and surf the Internet, and I wear women's clothing, what happens?" "How will your roommates react when you dress like a woman?" Or "If your roommate goes home and thinks about boys, don't even think about sleeping." Or "I was approached while wearing women's clothing to get takeout" etc. This type of video not only records the details of the life of the man and the woman, and make it easy for the audience to empathize, a character in the scene, such as a passerby, roommate, stranger, etc.</p>
</details>

为什么第二类剧本更值得分析？因为它揭示了观众在这种幻想中不可或缺的角色。生活记录视频可能被误解为是一个人的自我娱乐，而情景剧视频则揭示了男娘幻想的关键点：它绝不是扮演者自身的自我陶醉。当事人的努力，例如化妆、服装、表演，都是为了成为男性他者（如室友、兄弟、好哥们、男性路人等）的欲望客体。幻想的建立离不开他人的凝视。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why which of the second scripts is more worthy of analysis? Because it reveals that the audience is in this fantasy is indispensable, role. Life record videos, it may be misunderstood as a person's self-entertainment. The situational video, this reveals the key point of the male girl's fantasy. It's never the actor's own self-admiration. The efforts of the parties, such as makeup, clothing, performance, all for the sake of being the male other, like roommates, brothers, good buddies, desire of male passers-by, etc. The establishment of fantasy is inseparable from the gaze of others.</p>
</details>

这类题材也有几个核心的戏剧元素。首先，故事的快感往往来自于一个被打破的、充满张力的瞬间。这个瞬间意味着他者突然发现了男娘的真实性别。而男娘出现的场所，往往是男生宿舍、网吧包间，或是兄弟间的社交场合。这些都是高度男性化的空间，几乎没有真实女性的容身之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This type of subject matter also has several core dramatic elements. First, the pleasure of the story often comes from a broken, a powerful moment. This moment, it means that the other person suddenly discovered the true gender of the man-girl. And the place where the man appeared, it is often in male dormitories and internet cafe rooms, or social occasions among brothers and sisters. These are highly masculine, there is almost no room for real women.</p>
</details>

当他们发现男娘的存在时，男娘会立即陷入一种被支配的关系，成为被动、待人处置的诱惑客体。因为他毕竟不是真正的女性，这使得其他男性更容易接近他，而不会被认为是冒犯女性，这是一种男性之间“合法”的接触。为什么这种情节习惯于设定在男生宿舍或其他地方突然出现一个“女孩子”？因为这种戏剧真正的受众和目标，绝不是女性或整个社会，而是男性群体本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when they discover the existence of male girls, the man will immediately fall into a dominated relationship, become the passive one, waiting to be dealt with, tempting object. Because he's not a real woman after all. This makes it easier for other men to approach him. It will not be considered an offense against women. It is legal contact between men. Why this kind of plot? Get used to setting, what if a girl suddenly appears in the boys' dormitory or other places? Because the real audience and target of this drama, it's never women or society as a whole. The male group itself.</p>
</details>

男生宿舍这样的场所，是构建和确认男性气概的土壤。在这里，男性谈论女性、游戏、体育等，以强化彼此的男性身份。这里没有真实的女性，却充满了对女性抽象符号的想象和欲望。因此，这个空间是一个欲望高度压缩，却没有释放出口的“高压锅”。男娘的突然闯入，就像是在这个欲望高压锅中投下了一颗炸弹。他瞬间成为了男性空间中唯一的焦点，以及所有欲望的答案。他的被欲望性被放大到极致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Places such as the men's dormitory, it is the soil for constructing and confirming masculinity. Here, men talk about women, games, sports, etc., to strengthen each other's masculine identity. There are no real women here, but it is full of imagination and desire for the abstract symbol of woman. Therefore, this space is a place where desires are highly compressed, but there is no pressure cooker to release. The sudden intrusion of the man, it's like being in this pressure cooker of desire, drop a bomb. He suddenly became the male space, the only focus and answer to all desires. His desirability was magnified to the extreme.</p>
</details>

在这里，所有人都会毫无疑问地追逐她、渴望占有她。对于那些渴望成为男娘的男性来说，他反而会从中体验到一种极端的快感和权力感。只不过，他是通过被动的**施虐受虐**（Sadomasochism: 指通过施加或承受痛苦获得性快感的行为或心理倾向）来获得这种权力。而对于那些将男娘视为欲望客体的男性来说，这种幻想相当于发生在一个“法外之地”，因此也能最大限度地释放快感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here, everyone will chase her without a doubt, desire to possess her. For those men who want to be a man, instead, you will experience an extreme pleasure from it and a sense of power. It's just that he is passively masochistic to gain this power. And for, for men who regard girls as objects of desire, this fantasy, it is equivalent to happening in a lawless place. Therefore, it can also release pleasure to the greatest extent.</p>
</details>

在正常的男女互动中，男性的欲望受到一系列符号法则的规训。这个法则包括社会伦理、法律规范以及对女性作为独立主体的尊重。一个男性不能直接触碰女性，他的行动被这堵墙阻碍。但在男生宿舍的场景中，这种针对女性的法则在幻想的逻辑中被巧妙地悬置了。因为男娘的生理性别是男性，那么其他男性对他进行的任何肢体接触，都可以用“兄弟间玩闹”“开玩笑”“好奇的触碰”等名义合法进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In a normal interaction between men and women, male desire is governed by a series of symbolic laws. This law includes social ethics, legal norms, and respect for women as independent subjects. A man, you can't touch a woman directly. His movements were blocked by this wall. But in the boys' dormitory scene, this law targeting women, ingeniously suspended in the logic of fantasy. Because the biological sex of a man is male, then any physical contact with him by other men, can be used in "playing around with brothers" and "joking", "curious touching" is carried out under the guise of legality.</p>
</details>

通过这种幻想，施虐幻想者可以剥离性暴力的罪恶感，将其还原为一种纯粹的自然力量与臣服的戏剧。而渴望成为男娘的受虐者，则可以毫无负担地尽情享受自己的魅力，引发对方失控的纯粹快感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Through this fantasy, sadistic fantasists can strip away the guilt of sexual violence, reduce it to a pure natural force and drama of Surrender. And the masochist who longs to be a man's wife, no burden, enjoy the charm of yourself to the fullest, causing the other party to lose control, pure pleasure.</p>
</details>

### 幻想背后的心理机制：破碎的男性气概与权力感

至此，我们不得不提出一个问题：如果一个男性幻想成为男娘，并从中获得权力感，但权力有无数种形式，例如获得财富、知识、名声或社会地位，这些都能给人带来权力感。为什么当事人会选择这种看似如此“离经叛道”和“变态”的性幻想呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's it, we have to ask this question. If a man fantasizes about becoming a masculine, gaining a sense of power in this fantasy. But power comes in countless forms, such as gaining wealth, knowledge, fame or social status, it can give a person a sense of power. Why the parties will choose to take this, what about sexual fantasies that seem so devious and perverse?</p>
</details>

在这里，我们必须强调精神分析的一个原则：那就是症状的发展永远与**创伤**（Trauma: 指由外部事件引起的心理或情感上的严重伤害）或核心缺失区域直接相关，并总是精确地回应创伤的根源。正如我们在性幻想视频中谈到的，任何形式的性幻想，它总是指向对安全感的追寻。这种安全感并非我们通常理解的那种安全，因为很多性幻想看起来确实很危险，根本不安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here, we must emphasize a principle of psychoanalysis. That's how symptoms develop, forever and Trauma, or lack of core areas directly related to solution. Always responding precisely to the root cause of trauma. As what we talked about in the sexual fantasy video, any form of sexual fantasy, it always points to the pursuit of security. This sense of security is not the security we usually understand. Because a lot of sexual fantasies seem really dangerous, not safe at all.</p>
</details>

但这里所说的安全感，主要指的是摆脱那些导致自我攻击的病态信念的威胁。幻想成为亿万富翁，并不能直接治愈一个人感觉自己作为男性毫无魅力的痛苦。因为经济上的成功，无法直接回应他内心深处那个不断嘲讽他的声音：“你没有吸引力”“你得不到爱”。他必须在这个最纯粹的战场上，以幻想的方式转败为胜。他渴望在自己感觉最无能的地方，体验到极致的权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the sense of security mentioned here, mainly refers to, free from those who lead to self-attack, the threat of pathological beliefs. Fantasize about becoming a billionaire, it cannot directly cure a person, feeling like a man, the pain of having no charm. Because of financial success, unable to respond directly to the one deep in his heart, the voice that kept mocking him: "You're not attractive", "You Can't Get Love". He must be, on this purest battlefield, turn defeat into victory in a fantastical way. He wants to be in the place where he feels most incompetent, experience the ultimate power.</p>
</details>

这也能解释中国互联网上一个经久不衰的问题：“给你1000万现金，换你的清华、北大或其他985学历，你愿意吗？”从纯粹的经济角度看，学历本身完全无法与1000万现金相提并论，这个问题本身似乎缺乏社会常识。然而，这类问题之所以能层出不穷，并持续引发众多人的讨论，并非因为人们真的在进行经济计算，而是因为它触碰了无数人在高考独木桥上所经历的集体创伤和焦虑。正是因为创伤的强度过高，压倒了常识逻辑，才使得这个问题成为一个有意义的症状，并暴露了人类精神世界非理性的一面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This can also explain a persistent problem on the Chinese internet: "Give you 10 million in cash, in exchange for your Tsinghua, Peking University or other 985 degrees, would you like to?" From a purely economic perspective, a diploma itself, it's totally inadequate to compare with 10 million in cash. This question itself seems to lack social common sense. However, the reason why such problems can be so varied is that, it continues to spark discussion among many people. It's not because people are really doing economic calculations. But because, it touched countless people on the single-plank bridge of the college entrance examination. The collective trauma and anxiety experienced. It is because the intensity of the trauma is too high, logic that overwhelms common sense. This makes this problem, become a meaningful symptom. And exposed the human spiritual world, the irrational side.</p>
</details>

人从来都不是纯粹的理性经济人，我们的价值判断在很大程度上由无意识的符号逻辑所驱动。而幻想，总是表现为对创伤最忠实的“镜像”回应。男娘幻想也精确地反映了这一点。为什么有些男性会有成为男娘的幻想？首先，这一切都源于一个创伤点：主体感受到了男性气概的缺失。无论是由于严苛的家庭教育、父权压迫、成长中的挫折，还是因为当前社会文化对成功男性提出的高要求，总之，他感到自己在现实中深感无力。他觉得自己无法成为一个有吸引力、成功的男性，从而获得异性的青睐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People are never purely rational economic people. Our value judgment, to a large extent unconscious, driven by symbolic logic. And fantasy, always manifested as the most faithful to trauma, a "mirror" response. The male girl fantasy also accurately reflects this point. Why do some men, do you have the fantasy of becoming a sissy? First, it all started from a traumatic point. The subject feels a lack of masculinity. Whether it is due to strict family education, patriarchal oppression, the frustration of growing up, or is it because of the current social culture? High demands placed on successful men. In short, he felt deeply powerless in reality. He felt that he could not be an attractive, successful men, to gain the favor of the opposite sex.</p>
</details>

在这种挫折中，女性的形象被扭曲了。他无法拥有的女性，在他的幻想中，从一个平等的个体，变成了一个高高在上、可以随意挑剔和审判他的审判者。他会认为，因为她们性感且被欲望，所以她们拥有权力，可以支配自己的幸福和痛苦。他会无限放大这个女性所拥有的性特权。这当然是对真实女性的误解，本质上，它围绕着他作为男性的欲望而展开。他所理解的女性，是基于自己的无力和自卑所投射出的幻想形象。他幻想女性拥有他所不具备的、支配欲望的权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this frustration, the image of women is distorted. The woman he couldn't have, in his fantasy, from an equal, became a high and mighty, a judge who can find fault and judge him at will. He would think that because they are sexy and desired, so they have power, can dominate my happiness and pain. He will infinitely magnify what this woman has. This sexual privilege. This is of course a misunderstanding of real women. Essentially, it revolves around, he unfolds his desire as a man. The women he understands, it is based on his own powerlessness and inferiority, a fantasy image projected. He fantasizes that women have what he doesn't have, the power that controls desire.</p>
</details>

此时，“精神的诡计”开始发挥作用。他面临两条道路：第一条是现实的道路，即通过真实的努力，长时间的学习和奋斗，成为一个掌控生活、有吸引力的男性。这条路充满艰辛、不确定性，并且随时可能遭受新的失败。第二条道路是幻想的道路，他很快发现了一条快速修复创伤的捷径，那就是直接幻想自己成为一个女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this time, the "cunning tricks of the spirit" come into play. He faces two paths. The first is the realistic path, that is through real effort, a long period of study and struggle, to become a person who controls life, attractive man. This road is difficult, full of uncertainty, and you may suffer new failures at any time. The second path is the fantasy path, he soon discovered a, a shortcut to quickly repair trauma. That is the fantasy of becoming a woman directly.</p>
</details>

当事人觉得，既然我无法成为一个强大的男性，那么我也可以扮演一个女性，来成为一个强大男性或一群强大男性的欲望客体。通过这种戏剧性的身份互换，他将自己从一个追求欲望却失败的“失败者”，转变为所有男性欲望的中心。他不再需要追求任何人，他只需要存在就能激起他人的欲望。这样一来，他在幻想中，却感觉如此真实地重新获得了权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The parties feel, since I can't be a strong man, then I can also play a female, come be a strong man or a group of strong men, object of desire. Through this dramatic identity swap, he transformed himself, from a loser who pursues his desires but fails, becoming the center of desire for all men. He no longer needs to pursue anyone. He just needs to be there to arouse others' desire. In this way, he is in fantasy, but it feels so real, he regained power.</p>
</details>

即使是通过受虐的方式，但这恰恰说明了人类的无意识确实是一个不知疲倦、不断寻求捷径来缓解创伤和匮乏的大师。类似的转化在现实生活中也十分常见。例如，一个孩子非常害怕一个想象中的怪物或某个严厉的老师，他感到自己弱小、被动、随时可能受到伤害。于是，他突然开始扮演那个怪物，模仿老师的语气去教训其他孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even through masochism, but this just shows, the human unconscious is indeed a tireless, constantly seeking shortcuts, a master who relieves trauma and deprivation. Similar conversions are also very common in real life. For example, a child is very afraid of an imaginary monster or someone, strict teacher. He felt weak, passive, vulnerable at any time.</p>
</details>

在这一刻，他通过成为恐惧的来源，将两者合二为一，奇迹般地将自己的被动恐惧转化为了主动的、掌控一切的权力感。这与男娘幻想的逻辑完全相同：我无法战胜那个让我感到无力的力量，那么我就加入她，成为她。再比如，有些人感到自己在生活中时时刻刻都被一个无所不能的组织所控制，这个组织一直在跟踪他、迫害他。他感到如此无力和悲惨。然而，通过这样的叙事，他反而强化了自己的价值。如果我被这样一个强大的组织盯上，这恰恰说明我拥有某种令人恐惧的潜力，我对这个世界来说是极其重要的。因此，个体通过这种被**迫害妄想**（Persecutory Delusion: 精神病理学中指坚信自己受到他人或组织恶意对待的妄想）的方式，来抵御渺小和无力感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this moment, he does this by becoming the source of that fear, merge the two into one. Miraculously, I will turn my passive fear into, transformed into an active, a sense of power over everything. This is exactly the same logic as the male fantasy. I can't defeat the power that makes me feel powerless, then I will join her and become her. For example, some people feel that they are in life, all the time, all controlled by an omnipotent organization. This organization has been following him and persecuting him. He felt so powerless and miserable. However, through such a narrative, instead, he strengthened his own value. If I were targeted by such a powerful organization, this just illustrates, I have some potential to scare people. I am extremely important to this world. Thus, individuals defend themselves against the feeling of insignificance and powerlessness. Even though it is through the fantasy of being persecuted.</p>
</details>

### 症状与创造：幻想的转化

到目前为止，我们分析了许多看似奇怪和奇特的症状和幻想。从NTR情节到男娘文化，再到阴谋论，但它们都有一个共同点，那就是它们都是主体在面对现实挫折和**创伤**（Trauma: 指由外部事件引起的心理或情感上的严重伤害）时的一种退却。**退行**（Regression: 精神分析中指个体在面对压力时，行为和心理状态退回到早期发展阶段的现象）不仅仅意味着行为上的幼稚化，它指的是从更成熟、更复杂的力比多满足模式，例如工作、爱情和创造，退回到更早期的、更直接和原始的**自恋**（Narcissism: 指对自我过度的关注和爱慕）形式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far we have analyzed many symptoms and hallucinations that seem strange and peculiar. From NTR plot to effeminate culture, then to conspiracy theories. But they all have one thing in common, that is, they are all subjects, a retreat in the face of real setbacks and trauma. Regression doesn't just mean becoming childish in behavior. It refers to, from a more mature, more complex patterns of libido satisfaction, such as work, love and creation, back to an earlier era, a more direct and primitive form of narcissism.</p>

然而，一个精神现象是**升华**（Sublimation: 精神分析中指将不被社会接受的冲动或欲望转化为社会认可的活动）还是退行？是症状还是创造？并没有一个外在的、绝对客观的标准来区分这一切。最终的衡量标准在于主体与自身幻想的关系。

<p class="english-text">However, is a spiritual phenomenon sublimation or regression? Symptom or creation? There is no external, absolutely objective standard distinguishing all this. Final, the yardstick lies in the subject's relationship to his own fantasy.</p>

正如我们之前所说，当一个人被这些无意识的冲突和幻想所支配，被它折磨，为此感到羞耻和困惑，却又无法摆脱，当他被困在强迫性重复中时，他就是一个症状。在症状中，个体是被动的，是自己无意识的奴隶。

<p class="english-text">As we said before, when a person, dominated by these unconscious conflicts and fantasies, tortured by him, ashamed and confused for him, but can't get rid of, when you are trapped in compulsive repetition, he is a symptom. In the symptoms, individuals are passive, a slave to one's own unconsciousness.</p>

然而，当主体意识到它的存在，觉察到它的运作机制，当他理解了它所源于的创伤和匮乏时，一切都改变了。幻想的性质发生了根本性的转变，主体与幻想之间产生了一定的距离。他不再是被幻想所消耗的人。在这一刻，幻想不再仅仅是一个需要被治愈的症状，它可能成为一个有价值的、通往创造性和主体性事业的途径。

<p class="english-text">However, when the subject becomes aware of its existence, be aware of its working mechanism, when you understand the trauma and deprivation it stems from, everything changes. The nature of fantasy has undergone a fundamental shift, there is a certain distance between the subject and the fantasy. He is no longer the one consumed by fantasy. At this moment, fantasy is no longer just a, symptoms that need to be cured. It may become a valuable, towards a career of creativity and subjectivity.</p>

例如，通过思考来认识和分析自己的症状，个体可以创造出发人深省的作品。他可以利用这种独特的欲望结构和人生经验，**升华**（Sublimation: 精神分析中指将不被社会接受的冲动或欲望转化为社会认可的活动）为一篇文章、一幅画、一个视频。即使在生活中，他也可以在知情、安全和自愿的前提下，将这种幻想转化为探索自我和人际关系的游戏或爱好。关键的区别在于，一个人是被动地成为症状，还是主动地利用症状去创造；是从一个被无意识决定的客体，变成一个能够言说、分析和转化自己无意识的主体。

<p class="english-text">For example, recognize and analyze your symptoms through thinking, individuals can create thought-provoking works. He can use this unique desire, structure and life experience, sublimate into an article, a painting, a video. Even in life, he can do so on the premise of knowing, safety and voluntariness, this fantasy, transformed into a, games or hobbies that explore oneself and one's relationships. The key difference is, a person is passive and becomes a symptom, or actively use symptoms to create. From an object determined by the unconscious, become a person who can speak, the subject who analyzes and transforms his own unconscious.</p>
