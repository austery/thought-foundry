title: Cal Newport：深度工作、慢速生产力与数字时代专注力的重建
summary: 本期播客对话知名作家 Cal Newport，深入探讨了其核心概念“深度工作”和“数字极简主义”。他阐释了深度工作如何成为创造价值的关键，以及数字时代碎片化沟通（如“过度活跃的蜂巢思维”）如何损害我们的专注力与认知能力。Cal Newport 提出了“慢速生产力”的理念，强调以结果而非活动衡量产出，并通过透明的工作量管理和“小规模季节性”来提升效率和福祉。他呼吁年轻人尊重自己的注意力，避免被数字产品滥用，从而过上更充实、更有意义的生活。

### 深度工作：数字时代的核心竞争力

大家好，今天我们非常荣幸地邀请到 Cal Newport 先生，他以其在**深度工作**（Deep Work: 全神贯注于一项认知要求高的任务的状态）和**数字极简主义**（Digital Minimalism: 一种哲学，主张有意识地使用数字工具，以支持个人价值观并减少干扰）方面的开创性工作而闻名。Cal 彻底改变了我们在数字时代处理生产力和专注力的方式，因为从根本上说，你所专注的，就是你所成就的。今天，我们将把焦点放在您和您的工作上，Cal，非常欢迎您！

<p class="english-text">hi everybody we are thrilled to have Cal Newport on the show today known for his groundbreaking work on deep work and digital minimalism Now cal has revolutionized the way we approach productivity and focus in the digital age and basically you are what you focus on and today we focus on you Cal and your work so big welcome well thank you for having me I've been looking forward to this great now first of all what is deep work</p>
</details>

非常感谢您的邀请，我一直很期待这次对话。首先，什么是深度工作？深度工作是指你全身心投入到一项认知要求很高的任务中的状态。它有两个方面：你所做的事情需要高度专注，并且你能够心无旁骛地全神贯注。因此，当你的全部注意力都集中在这两件事上时，你就是在进行深度工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well thank you for having me I've been looking forward to this great now first of all what is deep work well deep work is the the state you're in in which you are giving full concentration to a cognitively demanding task so the two aspects to it is what you're doing requires a lot of concentration and you giving it concentration without any distraction so it's actually getting your full attention those two things together means you're doing deep work</p>
</details>

为什么它如此重要？因为这是人类大脑创造有价值事物的第一途径。如果你的目标是利用大脑创造出有价值的东西，那么实现这个目标最有希望的认知状态就是心无旁骛的专注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">and why is it important well this is the number one way you produce valuable things using the human brain like if your goal is I want to create something valuable using my brain the most promising cognitive state for accomplishing this goal is one of undistracted focus</p>
</details>

### 数字时代：专注力的消逝与碎片化工作

在您的书中，您提到我们似乎已经忘记了区分深度工作和**浅薄工作**（Shallow Work: 那些认知要求不高、容易分心、通常不创造新价值的任务）。请您谈谈这个问题。我认为发生的情况是，我们经历了“前台IT革命”，办公室里突然有了联网的电脑和低摩擦的数字通信。信息交流变得前所未有的便捷，我们无意中创造了一种工作文化，在这种文化中，我们优先考虑沟通，但这样做却将时间碎片化，以至于无法对任何事情进行持续的专注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now in your in your books you talk about the fact that we've kind of forgotten to differentiate between deep work and shallow work tell us about it well I think what happened is we got the front office it Revolution so suddenly we have Network computers in the office we have low friction digital communication um it's easier than ever before to move information back and forth and we accidentally created a work culture in which we were prioritizing the communication but by doing so we were fracturing time into fragments too small to actually give sustained concentration to anything</p>
</details>

我们贬低了不间断专注作为知识工作中一项重要活动的价值。通过这样做，我认为我们大大降低了产出的质量，并且让那些试图进行生产的个体筋疲力尽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we devalued unbroken concentration as an activity that mattered in knowledge work and by doing so I think we're greatly reducing the quality of what's being produced and we're burning out the individuals trying to do the production</p>
</details>

### 如何进入深度工作状态

那么，如何才能进入那种深度思考、深度工作的心态呢？首先，这需要时间。我认为这很重要，而且它也很容易被破坏。通常需要大约10到15分钟才能真正让你的注意力完全锁定在一个目标上。你必须抑制某些神经网络，激活其他神经网络。这就是为什么当你坐下来做一件困难的事情时，前10到15分钟会觉得很艰难，然后你就会感觉像进入了一个新的档位，仿佛“哦，我现在真的开始取得一些进展了”。这是因为你的大脑需要时间才能真正锁定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how do you get into that mindset that deep thinking deep work mindset well it takes time first of all right I think this is important it's also easily subverted it can take about 10 or 15 minutes to really get a target of your attention completely locked in you have to inhibit certain neural networks you have to activate other neural networks it's why when you sit down to do something hard it's hard for 10 or 15 minutes and then you feel like a new gear kicks in like oh now I'm actually starting to make some progress that's because your brain takes time to really lock in</p>
</details>

那么，如果你在努力做一件困难的事情的同时，又在快速查看电子邮件收件箱或查看手机上的动态，会发生什么呢？你正在打破那种来之不易的认知专注状态。因此，深度工作确实要求你专注于一件事，而不要试图改变你的认知情境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what happens then if you're trying to work on something hard and you're also doing quick checks of an email inbox or seeing what's going on on your phone you're breaking that hard one cognitive f FOC State and so deep work really requires that you remain focused on one thing without trying to change your cognitive context</p>
</details>

### 将深度工作融入日常：日程安排与会议管理

您如何将深度工作融入日常生活中？您一天中是否有不同的时间段来做这件事？嗯，这个问题有很多不同层面的答案，取决于你想要系统化到什么程度。在最低层面，就我考虑我眼前的一天而言，是的，你会为深度工作安排时间，它会出现在你的日历上，你把它当作一个会议来对待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you build this into your daily routine do you have different types of different times during the day when you do this well I mean there's answers to this question at all different levels depending on how systemic you want to get at the lowest level of just I'm thinking about my day in front of me yeah you schedule time for deep work and it's on your calendar and you treat it like a meeting right</p>
</details>

这在我的日历上，我要做这件事，那段时间我不可用。你和自己达成协议：如果我正在进行深度工作会话，那就是我正在做的事情，我不会在工作期间改变我的认知情境。一天中什么时候是最好的时间？这取决于个人，但大多数人来说，一天中早些时候比晚些时候更好。你仍然有更多的认知能量，你所遇到的干扰也更少，所以你的大脑更容易集中注意力。我主张会议应该在下午举行。这可能过于激进，无法成为绝对规则，但作为一个思想实验，这不失为一个好主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is on my calendar I'm going to do this thing I'm not available during that time time and you make a deal with yourself if I'm in a deep work session that's what I'm doing I'm not going to change my cognitive context while I'm working on this when is when during the day is the best time well it depends on the person but most people earlier in the day is better than later you still have more cognitive energy you still have less distractions that have been introduced into your cognitive landscape so far so your brain has an easier time actually focusing hey I'm a proponent of the idea that meeting should be something that happens in the afternoons now it might be too radical to make that an an absolute but as a thought experiment it's not a bad one</p>
</details>

### 消除干扰：过度活跃的蜂巢思维与电子邮件困境

消除干扰的最佳方法是什么？您是如何做到的？在知识工作中，最大的干扰来源是沟通。我们有一种协作模式，是在“前台IT革命”之后无意识地演变而来的，我称之为**过度活跃的蜂巢思维**（Hyperactive Hive Mind: 一种无意识形成的协作模式，依赖于即时、随意、来回的信息交流，导致持续分心），我们通过即时、随意的来回信息交流来即时解决问题。这是干扰的第一大来源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the best way to eliminate distractions how do you do it well the biggest source of distraction and knowledge work is communication right so what happens is we have a mode of collaboration that we implicitly evolved once we got the front office it Revolution I call it the hyperactive hvep mind where we work things out on the fly with ad hoc back and forth messaging that's the number one source of distraction</p>
</details>

如果我有七个不同的项目正在进行，每个项目都产生了这些非计划的来回对话，而这些对话对于项目的进展是必需的，那么这七个项目就会产生需要相对及时查看和回复的消息。这就会创造一种我必须持续检查沟通渠道和收件箱的氛围。所以，如果你想解决分心的问题，我们实际上必须解决过度活跃的蜂巢思维的问题。我们必须找到替代的协作方式，而不是仅仅依赖于全天不断到达的非计划消息，而我必须查看并回复这些消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if I have seven different projects I'm working on and each of them have generated these sort of unscheduled back and forth conversations that's required for these projects to make progress that seven projects generating messages that need to be seen and replied to relatively promptly that creates an atmosphere in which I have to continually check communication channels and inboxes so if you want to solve this problem of being distracted we actually have to solve the problem of the hyperactive hive mind we have to find alternative ways to collaborate that don't just depend on unscheduled messages arriving that I have to see and respond to throughout the day</p>
</details>

什么是过度活跃的蜂巢思维？我的意思是，这是我们无意识地使用、也未曾命名的协作方式。所以我给它起了个名字。就像我们一旦有了电子邮件，接着是聊天服务，我们就决定可以通过一直互相交流来解决问题。这就是我为什么说它是一个蜂巢思维——只是与任何人进行来回沟通，整个办公室都通过这些来回的消息相互连接。我称之为“过度活跃”，因为这些消息以非常高的频率来回传递。但问题是，这种“赛博化”的、我们都连接在一起并全天交流的模式，人类大脑是无法承受的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what is a hyperactive Hive I mean this is the collaboration style we use without use without knowing it without naming it so I named it like we just decided once email arrived and followed by chat services that we can all just figure things out by talking to each other all the time that's why I say it's a hive mind oh just back and forth communication with anyone the the whole office is Interlink with just these messages going back and forth and I call it hyperactive because these are going back and forth at a really high rate but the problem is like this whole sort of cybernetic noospheric we're all connected and talking to each other all day the problem is is the human brain can't do it</p>
</details>

您不是“抄送所有人”的忠实拥护者，也不是那种“我一有问题就立刻在 Slack 上找你，你马上回复我”的模式的忠实拥护者。这种模式在当下对你可能有用，但它创造了一个对人脑来说难以忍受的宏观认知环境。我无法在10分钟内来回切换处理七个不同的项目。一个拥挤的电子邮件收件箱对人脑来说就像一个雷区，它无法很好地处理。每条消息都有一个完全不同的上下文，大脑必须加载才能回复，但我们没有给自己足够的时间来做这些，因为我们必须处理100条消息。这让人筋疲力尽，甚至可能导致精神错乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so can you're not a big fan you're not a big fan of CC all I'm not a big fan of CC all I'm not a big fan of uh let me just immediately hit you up on slack when I have a question and you answer me right away that's useful to you in the moment but it creates a macrocognitive environment that is intolerable for the human brain I can't switch back and forth between servicing seven different projects in a 10-minute period a crowded email inbox is like a Minefield for the human brain it can't do this well every message has a entirely different context that the brain has to load up just to answer but we don't give our time enough time to do that because we have to get through a 100 messages uh it's exhausting it can be deranging on paper it seems very efficient but the reality of our human neurological Hardware says this way of working is not compatible with humans in the way we actually think and exist</p>
</details>

那么，我应该如何处理我的电子邮件积压呢？因为我早上醒来时，会有很多邮件，你知道，我们是一家全球性公司，我收到来自美国、新加坡等地的邮件，你知道那是什么感觉。我该怎么办？首先，我们必须从源头解决这个问题。因此，无论哪里有电子邮件的来源，如果存在另一种不需要非计划消息到达通用收件箱的沟通方式，我们就应该建立这些系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so how should I work through my email backlog we have because I have I have I wake up in the morning I got loads of stuff you know because we're a global company and uh I get stuff from uh from us from Singapore uh you know you know you know what it's like what what do I do well first of all we have to get to this problem at the source right so so wherever we have a source of email where there's another way to do that communication that doesn't require just an unscheduled message arriving in general inbox let's put those systems into place</p>
</details>

我们应该摒弃每个人只有一个电子邮件地址的想法。也许我们应该为不同类型的沟通设置不同的沟通渠道。因此，当我要处理与国际分销商的供应链问题时，所有这些沟通都有一个特定的地方，并且有特定的时间去查看。我们不希望所有这些信息都非计划地、混杂在一起，然后我必须按顺序处理。所以，我们首先要减少非计划消息的产生，然后我们要将通用的、所有信息混杂在一起的收件箱分开，拥有更专业的沟通渠道。所有这些都将对人脑更有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's get rid of the idea of having a single email address associated with each person now we maybe what we should have is different communication channels for different types of communication so when it comes time for me to uh deal with whatever supply chain issues with International Distributors there's like a place where all that communication is and there's a time when we look at that uh we don't want all of this to arrive unscheduled all mixed together into one big jumble that I then have to sequentially move through so we want to reduce the unscheduled messages being uh generated in the first place and then we want to pull apart having a just generic everything mixed together inbox and have more specialized communication channels all this will be better for the human brain</p>
</details>

### 智能手机与注意力经济的陷阱

谈到被打断，智能手机甚至更糟，对吧？我曾在某处读到，人们平均每七分钟就会查看一次手机。当您听到这个数字时，您会作何感想？是的，他们确实如此，但这并非这些手机的最初目的。几年前，我曾写过一篇关于史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）对 iPhone 最初愿景的评论文章，他的愿景绝不是让它成为一个你每七分钟就查看一次的“常伴”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I mean talking about being interrupted um smartphones um even worse right I read somewhere that on average people check their phones every seven minutes what what what do you think when you hear that right they do and it was not the original uh purpose of these phones you know I wrote it this this time op at a few years ago about Steve Jobs original vision for the iPhone which certainly was not this should be a constant companion that you check every seven minutes</p>
</details>

我们不断查看手机的原因，实际上与我们不断查看电子邮件收件箱的原因不同。手机在非专业环境中的问题，当然是**注意力经济**（Attention Economy: 一种商业模式，通过吸引和维持用户注意力来创造价值）的兴起。大约在2012年，人们发现“哦，如果我们让这些应用程序具有黏性，我们就能让人们一直盯着它们看，这里有一笔巨大的注意力资源可以挖掘。”所以，我们过度查看手机，是因为我们在手机上安装了旨在让我们这样做的应用程序。我们过度查看电子邮件收件箱，是因为我们有一种协作模式要求我们这样做。听起来相似的问题，但问题来源不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the cause of us checking our phones all the time is actually different than the cause of us checking for example our email inbox all the time uh the problem with phones in the nonprofessional context of course is the rise of the professional attention economy when it was discovered around 2012 oh if we make these apps sticky we can get people to look at them all the time and there's an incredible uh attention resource we can mine here so we look at our phones too much because we put apps on the phones designed to make us do that we look at our email inbox too much because we have a mode of collaboration that requires us to do so similar sounding problems different sources of the of the problem</p>
</details>

我曾在某处读到，即使你听到“叮”的一声，知道手机上有消息，当你再去完成一项任务时，你投入的智商会更少，基本上会变得不那么聪明，仅仅因为你知道手机上有些东西。嗯，我们是群居物种，出于充分的理由，我们非常认真地对待部落中有人需要我们这件事。因为我们从漫长的历史中得知，如果部落中有人需要我们而我们忽视了他们，我们可能会被长矛刺中。所以，我们非常在意这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I read somewhere that when you even if you hear like Ping and you know that there is a message on your phone when you then solve a task you apply less IQ to it you become basically less intelligent just by knowing there is something on the phone well we're we're a social species and and so for good reason we take very seriously for good evolutionarily evolutionary reasons we take very seriously someone in our tribe needs us because we've learned through our long history if someone in our tribe needs us and we ignore them uh we might get a spear in the back so like we really care about this</p>
</details>

问题在于，这个存在了几十万年的大脑，很难理解电子邮件收件箱的概念。因为在它看来，电子邮件收件箱里的消息就是“我们的部落成员需要我们”，而我们每时每刻不检查收件箱，就是我们忽视了部落成员，这是一件危险的事情。我们大脑中的警报会响起。社交型人脑很难适应现代数字收件箱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the problem is that same brain that's been around for a couple hundred thousand years has a hard time then with the idea of an email inbox because as far as it's concerned messages in an email inbox is our tribe members need us and we're and every moment that we're not checking that inbox and there's messages in there is US ignoring our tribe members and this is a dangerous thing to do alarm Bells go off in our brain the social human brain has a hard time with a modern digital inbox</p>
</details>

### 课堂中的手机与青少年心理健康

现在我要问一个可能有些“老生常谈”的问题，鉴于您之前所说的一切，我们是否应该将手机排除在课堂之外？是的。但在很多地方他们没有这样做。为什么？请告诉我您对此的看法。我认为不受限制的互联网访问，比如你拥有自己的智能手机，研究越来越清楚地表明，可能要到16岁，从心理学角度讲，才开始变得安全，也就是青春期之后。你基本上不应该在青春期之前拥有不受限制的电子邮件访问权限，应该在16岁及以后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now I'm going to ask you a lame question given what you already have said but uh should we exclude telephones from classrooms yes uh and in many places they don't why uh tell me what your view is on all this I think unrestricted internet access so what you would get for example if you just had your own smartphone uh the research is becoming increasingly clear that probably 16 is the age when that begins to become uh safe psychologically speaking post puberty right you should not have unrestricted email access until you have basically gone through puberty 16 plus</p>
</details>

这与我们过去十年尝试的做法非常不同。过去十年，我们尝试了“让我们给孩子们手机，看看会发生什么”的实验。这是一个合理的实验，但我认为结果是灾难性的。所以我们需要在文化上改变我们对此的看法。我认为两三年后我们就会走到这一步。这种认为12岁或11岁的孩子应该拥有手机的想法，在不远的将来，我们会像看待“我们不应该给青少年香烟”一样来看待它。我们需要等到他们更成熟才能处理它。我认为这就是我们对手机的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's very different than what we've tried for the last 10 years the last 10 years we experimented with let's just give kids phon and sees what happened a reasonable experiment I think the results have come back terrible things happen so we need to change the way we think about this culturally I think that's where we're going to be in two or three years this idea that a 12-year-old or 11y old be given a phone we're going to think about that not too far in the future the way we learn to think about oh we shouldn't be giving cigarettes to a teenager okay that they need to be older before they can deal with it that's where I think we are with phones</p>
</details>

### 深度工作、刻意练习与心流状态

当您谈到深度工作时，它与**刻意练习**（Deliberate Practice: 一种有目的、有系统地提高技能的方法，需要高度专注和即时反馈）有什么相似之处？埃里克森（Anders Ericsson）谈到了“一万小时定律”，这两者之间有什么联系？嗯，你需要处于深度工作的状态才能进行刻意练习。所以，它是你可以做的事情之一。因此，心无旁骛的专注是进行刻意练习和变得更好的认知状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you talk about deep work what are the similarities to deliberate training which Erikson is talking about the 10,000 hours just what are the what are the links between the two well you need to be in a state of deep work to do deliberate practice so it's it's one of the things you can do if so so focus without distraction is the cognitive state required to do deliberate practice and to get better</p>
</details>

所以，如果你不习惯专注，或者你一天中从不给自己时间真正专注某事，你就永远无法进入埃里克森所说的刻意练习状态，这意味着你学习新技能会非常慢，学习新事物也会非常慢。并非所有深度工作都是刻意练习。**心流状态**（Flow State: 一种心理状态，当一个人完全投入到某项活动中时，会感到精力充沛、全神贯注并乐在其中，时间感消失），当然也非常不同，除非你处于深度工作的状态，否则你也无法进入心流状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so if you uh are uncomfortable focusing or you never give yourself time during your day to really be focused on something you'll never be able to fall into a state of deliberate practice at the way that Ericson would have talked about it which means you're going to pick up new skills very slowly you're going to learn things very slowly not all deep workers deliver practice uh a flow state which of course is very different is also something you can't fall into unless you're in a state of deep work</p>
</details>

所以，深度工作就像一个保护伞。当你对某事给予不间断的专注时，你会获得这些潜力：你获得了刻意练习的潜力，能够快速擅长困难的事情；你获得了心流状态的潜力，能够沉浸在工作中并获得创造性洞察。但所有这些都统一于对不间断专注的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so deep work is like an umbrella when you give something unbroken concentration you get these potentialities you get the potential of deliberate practice getting good at hard things fast you get the potential of Flow State getting lost in your work and having creative insights but all of these are unified by the need to have unbroken concentration</p>
</details>

### 多任务处理的谬误与“快速检查”的危害

请解释一下**心流**（Flow）的概念，它是由一位名字非常难念的人发明的，是的，米哈里·契克森米哈伊（Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi）。那么，你需要处于深度工作状态才能进入心流状态吗？心流状态又是什么？心流状态是米哈里几十年前识别出的一种心理状态，在这种状态下，你完全沉浸在所做的事情中，任务变得包罗万象，你有一种时间感消失的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">K explain the the the concept of flow which is uh kind of invented by the guy with a very difficult name um yes that's M CH sent me high well there go so so I knew him did I knew him and Anders yeah good what um do you need uh to be in a kind of a deep work situation in order to be in the flow and and and what and what I'm sorry and what is being in the flow I mean flow State's the psychological state that mahaley identified decades ago in which uh you get lost in what you're doing the task becomes all-encompassing and you have this sensation of you've you've lost track you're not even thinking about the passage of time</p>
</details>

所以，当你真正沉浸在某事中时，运动员们经常报告这种状态：你完全沉浸在滑雪中，作为一名高山滑雪运动员，你只是在滑雪，这项活动变成了你的整个世界。艺术家们也经常进入这种状态：我在舞台上表演，我甚至没有意识到我的手指正在做着它们该做的事情，我只是沉浸在音乐中。这可能是一种非常有创造性、非常愉悦的状态。它需要不间断的专注。你不可能在保持心流状态的同时，还忙着处理电子邮件收件箱。所以，深度工作是心流状态的先决条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's characterized so it's like when you really get lost in something it's athletes report this all the time you're just you're lost in the skiing down doing your ski run as an Alpine skier and just it the activity becomes your whole world artists get into the state a lot uh I'm performing on stage and I don't even I'm not even aware my fingers are just doing what they're doing and it's I'm just in the music it it could be a very creative and a very pleasurable State uh it requires unbroken concentration you can't be in a flow State while also keeping up with your email inbox so deep work is a prerequisite for a flow State</p>
</details>

那么，同时处理多项任务的能力，这是否是一个谬误，认为你可以同时做两件事？是的，我们知道那是一个谬误。我们从21世纪初就开始研究这个问题了，比如克利夫·纳斯（Clifford Nass）关于多任务处理的研究。我们很快就明白了，当我们真正进行多任务处理时，比如告诉自己“我正在同时做这两件事”，我显然只是在它们之间非常快速地切换注意力。因此，没有任何事情能得到我全部的认知注意力，所以我们两件事都做得更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how does his tiin whe simultaneous capacity is that then a fallacy that you can do two things at the same time yeah we know that's a fallacy right uh we've done this since basically the early 2000s that there's you know Cliff Nas's research on multitasking like we learned pretty quick L okay when we literally multitask like tell ourselves I'm doing these two things concurrently um I'm clearly just switching my attention back and forth between them really quickly uh so nothing is getting my full cognitive attention and so we do both of them worse</p>
</details>

但我认为还有比多任务处理更阴险的事情。因为现在很多人都听过这个道理，所以他们不会同时打开两个窗口，也不会在打电话的同时尝试回复电子邮件。但我们转而做的事情，我认为几乎同样糟糕，那就是“快速检查”。比如，我主要在努力写这份非常困难的备忘录，但每隔五分钟，我就会快速检查一下电子邮件，因为我在等什么东西，然后我再回来继续写。我们拍拍自己的背说：“看，我正在单任务处理，我没有同时做两件事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's something even more Insidious than multitasking though because a lot of people now have heard that so they won't keep two windows open at the same time they won't try to answer emails concurrently with talking on the phone but what we do instead which I think can be almost as bad is the a quick check so I'm I'm mainly just trying to write this memo that's very hard but every five minutes I just check my email real quick because I'm waiting for something and then I come back to it and we Pat ourselves on the back and say look I'm single tasking I'm not doing two things concurrently</p>
</details>

但我们忽略了，即使是快速检查也要付出巨大的代价。所以，当我瞥一眼收件箱时，我的大脑会看到所有这些情绪上突出、似乎很紧急的来自“部落成员”的通信。即使我立即将注意力转回备忘录，也为时已晚。我的大脑已经开始处理“糟糕，全体出动，我们必须启动应对这些情况所需的机制”的过程。因此，快速检查会让我们陷入几乎与实际多任务处理一样糟糕的境地。我们的大脑会陷入琳达·斯通（Linda Stone）所说的**部分持续注意力**（Partial Continuous Attention: 一种认知状态，大脑从未完全专注于任何一件事，总是在不同情境之间切换）状态。它从未完全专注于任何一件事，总是在从一个情境切换到另一个情境的半途中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but what we leave out is that even the quick checks have a huge p a huge price right so when I glance at that inbox my brain sees all of these emotionally Salient sort of urgent Communications from my tribe members even if I then turn my attention immediately back to the memo it's too late my brain started the process of like uhoh all hands on deck we got to like fire up what we need to deal with these situations and so the the quick checks gives us a situation almost as bad as actual multitasking our brain falls into what Linda Stone calls partial continuous attention uh it never is fully focused on any one thing it's always halfway through changing from one context to another</p>

这就是大多数知识工作者整天所处的状态。这让人筋疲力尽，我们以大大降低的认知能力进行生产。女性比男性更擅长多任务处理吗？不，没有人脑能进行多任务处理。每个人脑都需要10到20分钟才能真正锁定在一个复杂的认知情境中。每个人脑，无论你做多久，都会被每五分钟检查一次收件箱或试图同时做两件事所困扰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is the state where most knowledge workers spend their entire day uh it's exhausting and we're producing at significantly reduced cognitive capacity a ween better at multitasking than men no human brain can multitask every human brain needs 10 to 20 minutes to really lock in on a on a complicated cognitive context every human brain no matter how long you've been doing it is going to be befuddled by checking an inbox every five minutes or trying to do two things at once</p>
</details>

### 过度活跃的长期影响与慢速生产力

当你长时间处于这种过度活跃的状态时，你的大脑和健康会发生什么？嗯，这简直是筋疲力尽。这就是为什么到了下午，你会发现自己无法真正做任何困难的事情，甚至无法真正处理你的收件箱。你开始只挑选那些容易回复的消息。这基本上是你的大脑在“投降”，它在说：“好了，我受够了。你一直在尝试做这种不自然的事情，你一直在让我来回切换，我累坏了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what happens when you uh are in this state of hyperactivity over a long period of time what happens to your brain and to and to your wellbeing well it's uh quite literally exhausting right it's Why by the time you get to the afternoon you find yourself unable to really do anything hard you find yourself unable even really to deal with your inbox and You Begin picking out just the messages that are easy to respond that's basically your brain crying Uncle like okay I've had enough you've been trying to do this unnatural thing you've been switching me around uh I'm exhausted</p>
</details>

所以，这是一种字面上的疲惫。我们还可以将其他负面影响，比如压力或焦虑，与此联系起来。我们只是感觉很糟糕，因为我们正在做一些我们不适应的事情。然后还有心理上的困扰，比如“我知道我应该做这些重要的事情，我受过很多训练，我很擅长，我本可以制定策略或生产东西，但我却没有做到。我所做的只是谈论工作，而且我跟不上。”所以，我们有神经上的不适，再加上这种心理上的困扰，觉得“这不可能是正确的工作方式”。这两者结合起来就是**倦怠**（Burnout: 因长期工作压力过大而导致的身体、情感和精神疲惫状态）的根源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so there's a literal exhaustion to it we have you can connect other negative AFF effect like stress or anxiety to it as well we just feel bad because again we're doing something that we're we're not wired to do and then there's the psychological distress of saying I know there's these important things I should be doing that I have a lot of training that I'm good at that I could be strategizing or producing stuff that and I'm not getting to it all I'm doing is talking about work and and I can't keep up with it so we have like neurological discomfort plus this sort of psychological distress of like this can't possibly be the right way to work those two things together is a recipe for Burnout</p>
</details>

作为对这种现象的回应，您写了另一本书《慢速生产力》。这本书讲了什么？我认为现在我们对知识工作生产力的隐性定义是基于活动量的，我称之为**伪生产力**（Pseudo Productivity: 一种将活动量作为衡量有用努力的替代指标的理念，导致人们过度追求忙碌而非实际产出）。这种观念认为，活动量将是衡量有用努力的替代指标。所以，我看到你做的事情越多，就越好。这在电子邮件和聊天世界中行不通，因为我可以非常疯狂地、以非常精细的规模向你展示活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so as a reaction to this you wrote another book slow productivity so what is this about so I think right now our implicit definition of productivity and knowledge work is based on activity I call it pseudo productivity it's this notion of activity will be a proxy for useful effort so the more I see you doing stuff the better this does not play well with a world of email and chat where I can show you activity uh incredibly frantically and in a very fine grain scale</p>
</details>

**慢速生产力**（Slow Productivity: 一种以结果而非活动衡量生产力的方法，强调减少同时处理的任务、设定实际时间框架并追求高质量产出）是一种不同的生产力思维方式，它更多地基于结果。我希望随着时间的推移，能够产出真正重要的好东西。为了做到这一点，我需要同时处理更少的事情，我需要对我的时间框架更现实，并且我需要将此与真正痴迷于我所做事情的质量相结合。从人类的角度来看，这是一种更自然的认知工作方式，更不耗费精力，最终也更有效。它将产出更好的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">slow productivity is a different way of thinking about productivity which is based much more on results I want to produ produce good stuff over time that really matters and in order to do this uh I need to work on less things at the same time I need to be more realistic about my time frames and I need to couple that with really obsessing over the quality of what I do that is like the much more natural from a human perspective the much more natural way of approaching cognitive work less exhausting and ultimately much more effective it's going to produce much better stuff</p>
</details>

所以，我们必须从这种疯狂的活动中慢下来，一次做更少的事情，但把这些事情做得非常好，并以更快的速度完成它们。我认为这将是一种更好的方式，至少我在书中提出的这种方法，对知识工作者来说将更具可持续性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we have to slow down from this frantic activity do less things at once but do these things really well move through them at a faster rate I think this is going to be a much better uh this is the recipe at least I'm pitching this book this going to be much more sustainable for knowledge workers</p>
</details>

### 慢速生产力的科学与哲学

这是科学还是哲学？嗯，它是所有这些事物的结合。我的意思是，我们知道，例如，有些事情是常识。如果我们同时处理太多事情，会发生什么？我们同意做的每件事都会产生其自身的行政开销。我们正在进行的每个项目都会产生其自身的电子邮件和会议。所以，如果我答应做10件事，我的日程表上就会有10个项目的行政开销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is this science or is it philosophy uh it's a combination of all these things right I mean we we know for examp some of this just common sense right uh if we work on too many things at the same time What Happens everything we've agreed to is going to generate its own administrative overhead every project we're working on generates its own emails and its own meetings so if I say yes to 10 things I have 10 projects worth of administrative overhead squatting there in my day on my schedule</p>
</details>

现在，实际推进这10件事的能力大大降低了。如果我转而说：“等一下，我答应做10件事，但我一次只做两件。”现在，我的日程表上只有两个项目的行政开销。现在我可以花很多时间在这两件事上，我可以快速完成这些事情，我可以以更高的质量完成这些事情，然后再引入下一件事。我的意思是，有些是常识，有些是科学：人脑是如何运作的？我们与工作的关系在过去30万年里是怎样的？它不是全年每天8小时高强度工作。我们需要更多的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the ability now to actually make progress on any of these 10 things gets greatly reduced if I instead say wait a second uh I've agreed to do 10 things but I'm only going to work on two at a time now I only have the administrative overhead of two projects on my schedule at a time now I can spend a lot of time working on these two things I can get these things done fast I can get these things done at a much higher level of quality and then pull in the next thing I mean so some of this is just common sense some of this is science you know how is the human brain wired what is our relationship with work over the last 300,000 years it's not 8 hour days full intensity all year round we need more variation</p>
</details>

还有一些是哲学。人类想要生产好的东西。所以，以质量为中心重新调整工作，而不是仅仅以活动量为中心，这在哲学上会与人类精神产生共鸣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and some of it's philosophical humans want to produce stuff that's good so reorienting work around quality in a way just from activity is something that's going to philosophically resonate with the human Spirit</p>
</details>

### 慢速生产力：表面“慢”实则“快”

Cal，据说我们现在走路和说话的速度比30年前快了10%，而您说话的速度确实比大多数人快。那么，当那些“慢悠悠”的人走过来时，您作何反应？嗯，慢速生产力的人是这样的：他们看起来并不慢，事实上，当你从宏观上看时，你会说：“哇，这个人产出了很多东西。”我的意思是，这本书里有很多案例，当你从宏观上看这个人过去十年或整个职业生涯时，你会觉得：“天哪，这是一个超级高效的人，他们做了所有这些重要的事情！”但当你聚焦到某一天时，它看起来却不那么忙碌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cal supposedly we walk and talk 10% faster than we did 30 years ago and you indeed talk faster than most I mean how do you react if these slow dudes come along well you mean here's the thing about the people who are slowly productive right they don't seem slower and in fact when you zoom out you say wow this person's producing you know I mean case after case in this book is you you zoom out and look at this person's last decade or their career and like my God this is a super productive person they did all of these things these things are really important but then you zoom in on a particular day and it looks non-f frantic right</p>
</details>

所以，关于慢速生产力，有趣之处在于你观察的尺度很重要。如果你聚焦到某个小时，你可能会说：“哇，这个人真慢，他们只是在做某件事，没有来回奔波，也没有接这个电话或那个电话。”但如果你把时间拉长到一整年，你会说：“哇，看看他们完成了所有这些事情！他们真的在交付成果，真的在发挥作用。”所以，对“慢”的感知取决于你观察的时间尺度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like the interesting thing about slow productivity is the scale you look at matters if you zoom on a particular hour you might say wow this person is slow like they're they're just working on something they're not running back and forth and jumping on this call or whatever but you zoom out to the whole year like wow look at all this stuff they got done like they're they're really like delivering they're really making a difference so you know that the perception of slowness depends on what time scale you're looking at</p>

### 企业中的工作量管理与小规模季节性

您如何在公司中构建这种态度？我认为工作量管理必须透明。我的意思是，这是公司可以做的第一件事之一，就是我们必须摆脱这种知识工作的理想，即“你如何管理你的工作由你决定，每个人都是自主的”。我们有关键绩效指标（KPIs），我们有目标，但你如何管理你的工作，这都由你决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how do you how do you structure that kind of attitude in a company I think workload management has to be transparent right I mean this is like one of the number one things a company can do is we have to move away from this knowledge work ideal of uh how you manage your work is up to you like everyone is just autonomous about it we have we have our kpis we have our objectives but how you manage your work how you that's all up to you</p>
</details>

以这种方式进行，即完全由每个人自己决定，问题在于工作量会失控。就像我不知道，我必须决定每一件事我是否应该做，我必须应对社交动态。我认为工作量管理应该更加透明。我在书中举了很多这样的例子，比如：“好的，这是我们需要做的工作，我们把它列在这里。你作为个人还没有拥有它。这是我们团队正在做的事情。好的，这是你正在做的具体事情。现在，这是我们关于每个人一次应该做多少事情的具体想法，是两件。但我确切地知道你在做什么，所以你完成了吗？太棒了，让我们给你一件新事情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the problem about doing it that way where it's fully just everyone does their own thing is that workloads get out of control it's like I don't know I have to decide on every single thing whether I should do it or not I have to navigate to social dynamics I think workload management should be much more transparent I push a lot of examples like this the book where okay here's what we need to work on and we have it listed right here you don't own it as a person yet here's the things our team's working on all right here's the specific things from this list that you're working on now here is specifically our idea about how many things each person should be working on at once it's two but also I know exactly what you're working on so did are you done with that great let's get you a new thing</p>
</details>

我们必须更明确地说明需要做什么，谁在做什么，每个人应该做多少，他们正在做的事情的状态是什么。这不应该只存在于每个人内心，只有他们自己知道他们在做什么，所有这些都分散在各种电子邮件和他们在 Slack 上同意的事情中。明确的工作量管理是拥有可持续工作量管理的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we need to be much more explicit about what needs to be done who's working on what how much should people be working on what's the status of what they're working on this should not just in uh exist in internally to each person they only they know what they're working on it's all just sort of spread out over various emails and things they've agreed to on slack explicit workload management is the foundation for having sustainable workload management</p>
</details>

您提到了**小规模季节性**（Small Seasonality: 在较小时间尺度上（如每周或每天）引入工作强度变化，以提高可持续性），那是什么？嗯，如果我们想让工作可持续，我们需要更多的强度变化。所以，广义上的季节性，字面上的季节性，就是季节是不同的，对吧？这是新石器时代革命，冬天比秋天更安静。小规模季节性是指我们可以在更小的尺度上进行强度变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you you talk about something called small seasonality what is that well we need more variation in intensity if we want work to be sustainable so uh broad seasonality the literal seasonality is seasons are different right this is the Neolithic Revolution the winter is quieter than the fall small seasonality is saying okay we can have variations in intensity on smaller scales right</p>
</details>

这可能意味着这周我们稍微放慢脚步，在一个辛苦的月份之后重新调整。也可能意味着我周五不安排会议，这样周五我就可以稍微放松一下，更深入地思考更大的项目。所以，它是在你的日程表中引入强度变化，不是以整个季节的规模，而是在更小的时间尺度上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it might be this week we're sort of pulling back a little bit to regroup after a hard month it could be I'm not putting meetings on Friday so like Friday is a day I can sort of pull back and and think deeper about bigger projects right so it's putting variation of intensity into your schedule not at the scale of whole Seasons but at smaller time scales</p>
</details>

您认为我们应该实行四天工作制吗？对我来说，我认为我们需要先解决实际问题，而不是仅仅治疗症状。问题是工作量过载，我们同时处理太多事情。简单地减少工作天数并不能解决这个问题。解决这个问题的是明确的工作量管理。我们应该一次做更少的事情。对我来说，这更重要。我们不能仅仅通过减少工作天数来解决这个问题。我们实际上必须减少我们正在做的事情的数量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think we should go to full day weeks to me I think uh we need to get to the actual problem before we just treat the symptoms the problem is overload we're working on too many things simply reducing the number of days we work doesn't solve that problem what solves that problem is explicit workload management we should be working on fewer things at once to me that's way more we can't solve that problem by just trying to reduce the number of days we work we need to actually reduce the number of things we're working on</p>
</details>

这并不是一个肤浅的修补，比如“让我们改变工作日”。我们实际上必须深入到如何确定谁在做什么，每个人一次应该做多少。所以我更倾向于解决组织运行的实际系统，工作如何分配，工作如何完成，协作如何发生，这些才是需要解决的地方，而不是“让我们改变我们的日程，让我们把它变成混合模式而不是非混合模式”，那只是在处理症状，而不是解决根本病因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um it's not a superficial fix like let's just change what days we work we actually have to get down to how do we figure out who's working on what how much should each person be working on at a time so I I'm a much bigger proponent of getting to the actual systems by which organizations run the way work is assigned the way work is done how collaboration happens that's where the fixes need to be not let's change our schedule let's make it hybrid versus not hybrid that's just dealing with the symptoms it's not getting to the underlying disease</p>

### 训练专注力：富有成效的冥想

让我们专注于专注力。您说我们必须训练我们的思维才能专注。那么，您如何训练您的思维才能专注呢？嗯，它必须习惯。我的意思是，将你的心智之眼内在地维持在某种抽象的符号目标上，对人类来说不一定那么自然。这就像阅读一样，我们必须劫持大脑中为其他目的而进化的部分，并教它们如何将符号解释成意义，就像我们阅读时那样。专注于抽象概念，比如商业策略，或者我们要写的一个想法，这并不自然。我们必须练习它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's um focus in on Focus um now you say that we must TR we must train our mind to be to be in Focus just how do you how do you train your mind to be in Focus well it has to get used to it like the the state of maintaining your mind's eye internally on some sort of abstract symbolic Target is not necessarily that natural for humans it's just like reading we have to hijack parts of our brain that evolve for other purposes and teach them how to interpret symbols into meaning like we do when we read focusing on abstract ideas a business strategy an idea that we're going to write it's not natural we have to practice it</p>
</details>

你练习得越多，就越容易进入那种状态，你的专注力也能推得越深。但如果你不练习，然后你突然说：“好吧，我要留出一些时间进行深度工作。”但你以前从未真正练习过，那结果就不会好。你会觉得：“我无法保持专注，我的思绪到处乱飞，什么也做不成。”所以，记住这一点非常重要：如果进展不顺利，那并不意味着你天生不适合专注，只是意味着你还没有练习过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the more you practice it the more uh easy it is for you to get in that state and the deeper you can actually push your concentration but if you don't practice it and then you're like okay I'm gonna put aside some time for deep work but you've never really practiced this before it's not going to go well right it's gonna I can't keep my focus my mind's all over the place like nothing's getting done and so it's really important to remember if it doesn't go well that doesn't mean you're not wired to focus it just means you haven't practiced it yet</p>
</details>

冥想有帮助吗？它可能会有帮助，但对我来说，正确的练习就是练习你真正想擅长的事情。不要去做那些只是有点相似的练习。冥想确实有一些与实际专注相似的“肌肉”，但为什么不直接练习实际的专注呢？所以我更常给人们的练习，我称之为**富有成效的冥想**（Productive Meditation: 一种专注练习，在散步时专注于解决一个特定的专业问题，并在注意力分散时将其拉回）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">does meditation help it could help right but I to me the right practice is practice the actual thing you want to get better at right don't like meditation has some muscles in it that's similar to what it's like to actually focus on something but why not just practice actually focusing so the exercise I give to people more often I call it productive meditation</p>
</details>

我建议他们去散步，这有助于锻炼，因为散步会让你的某些神经回路安静下来，所以更容易集中注意力。去散步，心里想着一个你打算尝试解决的专业问题。就像正念冥想一样，如果你的注意力从问题上分散了，你只需注意到这一点，然后把它拉回来：“不，回来，我们要尝试解决这个问题。”如果它分散了，开始思考你的电子邮件，你就说：“不，回来，我们只思考这个问题。”如果你定期进行富有成效的冥想，你实际上会更擅长维持对目标的内在专注。所以我非常相信，让我们直接练习我们想擅长的事情，而不是相关的事情。让我们直奔主题，提高我们想做好的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what I suggest they do is you go for a walk uh this helps you with the exercise because the walking silences some of your neural circuits so it's a little bit easier to concentrate go for a walk have a single professional problem that you're going to try to make progress on just in your mind and just like in mindfulness meditation if your attention wanders from the problem which it will you just notice that and bring it back nope come back we're going to try to solve this problem it wanders and thinks about your email like no come back we're just going to think on this problem if you do productive meditation on a regular basis you will actually get much more Adept at sustaining internal concentration on a Target so I'm a big believer of let's just practice the thing we want to get better at not adjacent things let's just get cut right to the chase of what we want to do better</p>

当我在伦敦和纽约工作时，我会步行上班，所以我应该在开始前设定一个问题，然后思考一个小时。这太棒了！我以前在麻省理工学院（MIT）做博士后时，每天都这样做。哇，我真的能感觉到不同，它真的就像一种超能力。就像你经常锻炼时，你会意识到“哦，我感觉我能举起重物，或者我能跑得更快”，如果你经常这样做，你也能在认知上感受到同样的感觉。

### 思考周：比尔·盖茨的洞察力来源

那么，像比尔·盖茨（Bill Gates）这样的人呢？他每年会花一周时间阅读，阅读各种不同类型的研究，花一周时间远离尘嚣做这件事。您对这类活动有何看法？是的，我认为**思考周**（Think Week: 一种定期安排的、远离日常干扰的集中思考和阅读时间，旨在促进深度思考和新想法的产生）是个好主意。我的意思是，我甚至在《深度工作》那本书中也写到了比尔·盖茨。他会这样做，他会拿一堆书，然后去他在西雅图郊外乡村的某个小木屋。

</details>

不过我最近听一位认识他的人说，他改变了思考周的结构，我忘了具体是怎么改的，但他仍然会有一周时间远离所有外部刺激，这样他就能让自己的思维慢慢发展。众所周知，在90年代的一次思考周中，比尔·盖茨突然意识到：“哦，天哪，消费者互联网将成为一件非常重要的事情。”他回来后写下了《**互联网浪潮**》（The Internet Tidal Wave: 比尔·盖茨在1995年撰写的一份内部备忘录，强调了互联网的重要性及其对微软未来战略的影响）备忘录，那份备忘录就是思考周的产物。正是有了那段时间让他坐下来思考，他才突然意识到：“天哪，我们即将错过自个人电脑以来最重要的消费者数字产品趋势。”思考周是他找到答案的空间。

### 深度思考：一种失落的艺术

认真思考是一种失落的艺术吗？我想说，作为大众，我们在这方面越来越差，因为我们总是心烦意乱，我们处于认知失调的状态。在某些地方，这种能力仍然得以保留。在某些领域，学术界保留了它。我的意思是，我是一名理论家，我最近在《纽约客》上写了一篇文章，讲述了我在麻省理工学院计算机科学实验室理论小组的经历，以及我在那里学到了多少关于将思考本身视为一项你想要提高和重视的一流技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is serious thinking and lost art you know we're getting worse at it I would say just as a populist because we are so distracted all the time we're just out of shape we're out of cognitive shape there are still places where it's preserved we Academia preserved in certain Fields I mean I'm a theoretician I I I wrote a New Yorker piece about this recently about my time in the theory group in the computer science lab at MIT and how much I learned there about just thinking about thinking as a tier one skill you want to get better at and care about</p>
</details>

仍然有这样的地方。体育运动中也有这样的地方，毫不奇怪，有些职业运动员是我的书的忠实拥护者，尤其是在高尔夫球领域。像罗里·麦克罗伊（Rory McIlroy）就是《深度工作》和《数字极简主义》的忠实粉丝，因为事实证明，这是一项专注力至关重要的运动。你一旦失去专注力，就出局了。艺术领域，我认为这种能力仍然得以保留。很多艺术形式，如果你不全神贯注，就无法精通乐器。所以这种艺术仍然存在，但作为大众，我们思考的能力可能比过去50年左右的任何时候都要差。

<details>

<p class="english-text">there's still Pockets like that around Sports has pockets of this uh not surprisingly there's some professional athletes who are big Believers in my books uh we see that especially in golf like Rory mikoy is a big fan of deep work in digital minimalism because that turns out to be a game where the ability to focus is everything you lose your focus that's it you're out of the tournament uh the Arts I think this is still preserved there's a lot of Arts where you can't get better at an instrument without giving it intense Focus so this art still exists but as a populace we're worse at thinking probably than we've ever been uh in the last 50 years or so</p>

当您遇到那些进行深度思考的人和不进行深度思考的人时，他们有什么区别？他们的思想清晰度和原创性。因为当你练习深度思考时，你可以在脑海中 удерживать 一个想法，也可以 удерживать 相关联的想法，你可以将它们放在一起看：“这与那有什么关系？”他们能看到事物中的模式和系统，他们能找到有趣的切入点，他们能看到“这里到底发生了什么？这些部分是如何组合在一起的？”所以，思想的原创性和清晰度，是那些非常擅长在脑海中保持专注的人的标志。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and when you meet people what distinguish people who are into deep thinking from those who aren't uh the clarity and original of their thoughts right this this ability because when when you're practice that deep thinking you can hold an idea in your mind you can hold related ideas in your mind you can look at them together okay how does this relate to this they they see things and patterns and systems they find the interesting angles they they they they what's what's really going on here how do these pieces fit together so originality and Clarity of thinking that is the the the Hallmark of someone who is very comfortable just maintain concentration in their Mind's Eye</p>

这很有趣。所以，当你和某人坐在一起吃饭，如果他们有真正有趣、清晰、与众不同的想法，那很可能是因为他们自己进行了深度思考。是的，没有被普遍思维所束缚。是的，这可能是一个不花很多时间在 TikTok 上的人。你通常可以看出来，他们有思想的原创性。他们只是坐着思考，然后突然冒出这些有趣的想法。

在学术界，你可以立刻发现这一点。最深刻的思想家，他们的思维非常集中。如果你像我一样是理论家，那就是算法设计的原创性。你会发现：“哦，你吸收了这个人的工作和那个人的工作，你发现它们是真正相互关联的，而这才是真正重要的东西。如果我们这样调整它，我们就能做到那样。”现在你就有了一个新的结果，它超越了以前任何人所能做到的。所以，在学术圈里，如果你是物理学家、理论计算机科学家或数学家，深度思考的标志就非常清晰，你可以在工作中直接看到。

<p class="english-text">you have these know in Academia you could pick this up right away like the deepest thinkers it's very focused like if you're a theoretician like me it's originality and an algorithm design it's the oh you took in what this person did and what that person did and you saw that they were really connected and here was the thing that really mattered and if we tweak it this way we can then do that and now you have like a new result that that's beating what anyone else ever was able to do before so like in academic circles if you're a physicist if you're a theoretical computer scientist if you're a mathematician the signature of deep thinking is just incredibly clear you see it right in the work</p>

### 深度生活的益处与放松方式

您认为通过深度工作可以改善生活的哪些方面？从专业角度讲，几乎任何知识工作岗位，你都会做得更好。知识工作就是人类大脑被货币化。所以，如果你非常擅长专注那个大脑，你在那个市场中就非常有价值。在工作之外，它对**内省**（Introspection: 对自己的思想、情感和动机进行自我观察和分析）非常有用，有助于理解你是谁，以及你如何融入对世界的更大理解。因为你能够吸收信息，建立起关于什么重要、什么不重要的内部图式，价值结构、思想结构，你可以理解你与这些部分的联系。所以，你将对你自己和你的世界有更复杂的理解。因此，它也有很大的内省优势。

<p class="english-text">which aspects of Life can you improve by doing this you think well professionally speaking uh almost any knowledge work job you're going to be much better at like it knowledge work is the human brain being monetized right so if you are really good at focusing that human brain you are really valuable in that Marketplace outside of work it's fantastic for introspection for trying to understand who you are and how you fit into a larger understanding of the world because you're able to take in information build up this internal schema about what matters what doesn't value structures idea structures you can understand your relationship to these pieces so you're going to have a much more sophisticated understanding of yourself and your world so there's a great uh introspective Advantage as well</p>
</details>

对艺术的享受是另一回事。我的意思是，如果你看到一位伟大的电影制作人或影评人，例如，你知道那需要真正专注于艺术中发生的事情，并理解这些部分为何契合，为什么这如此感人。嗯，他们正在用摄影和剪辑做着这样那样的事情。所以，你也可以在更高的层次上欣赏艺术。所以，在很多领域，就像我在我的一本书中说的，一种“深度生活”就是一种好生活。因为我真的相信，这可以追溯到亚里士多德（Aristotle），他在《**尼各马可伦理学**》（Nicomachean Ethics: 亚里士多德关于伦理道德的著作，探讨了幸福、美德和良好生活）中谈到了这一点，人类的独特之处在于这种持续抽象专注的能力，没有其他动物能做到。所以，这是我们内在的本性，我们应该这样做。它使我们最像人类，我们应该真正拥抱它。我认为它确实让我们的生活更丰富。

<p class="english-text">enjoyment of Arts is another thing of thing right I mean if you see like a great filmmaker movie critic for example you know that requires the ability to to really concentrate on what's happening in the art and understand what why these pieces fit together why is this so affecting well it's it's they're doing this and that with the cinematography but also with what they're doing with the cuts you know so you can appreciate Arts at a higher level as well so there's a lot of areas where you know I I say this in one of my books that the sort of a a deep life is a good life because I really believe and this goes all the way back to Aristotle right this is the nican ethics he talks about this but humans are distinguished by this ability to give sustained abstract attention no one else no other animal does and so it's our in our sort of intrinsic nature that we should be doing this what makes us most human we should really embrace it does make our life I think richer</p>

您说“深度生活就是好生活”，那么当您过着“糟糕的生活”时，当您放松而不深入思考时，您是如何放松的？我个人会做什么？是的，我所做的就是坐着做专注练习。嗯，我有三个年幼的孩子，所以您说的“放松”这个词对我来说很陌生。

<p class="english-text">so you say a deep life is a good life so what do you do when you have a bad life uh when you are relaxing and not going deep what do you how do you relax what do I do personally yeah all I do is sit around and do Focus exercises um you know I have three kids who are young so I this word relax you speak of is odd to me</p>
</details>

所以，我的家庭生活有很多事情要忙。除了阅读和写作，我还有一个爱好，就是喜欢电影。所以对我来说，我喜欢看电影，喜欢看电影，喜欢读关于电影的书。我喜欢它与我的职业无关，所以我可以纯粹享受这种艺术，而不必担心其他艺术形式背后的一切。

<p class="english-text">so we have we have a I have a lot going on with my family life um I do like my one hobby outside of just you know I read a lot and WR a lot is I do like movies and so so to me uh I love going to the movies I love watching movies I love reading about movies I I love that it has nothing to do with what I do professionally so I can just enjoy that art without having to worry about all of the stuff that goes behind the other types of art I'm involved in</p>
</details>

但是当您看电影时，您处于什么样的心态？我非常投入。我的意思是，我经常需要，通常是第二次观看一部电影时，我才真正开始喜欢它。我通常更喜欢第二次观看一部电影。第一次观看时，我只是在吸收信息，并注意到自己的反应。第二次观看时，我就会关注电影制作，比如导演是如何做到这一点的？你和我都开始注意到，你知道，那些真正重要的事情，比如他们在剪辑方面做了什么？他们在摄影方面做了什么？

<p class="english-text">but what kind of state of mind are you in when you watch a movie I'm really engaged I I I mean I'm I'm really interested in I mean I often have to it's my second viewing of a movie is when I really start to like a movie I really like the second viewing I usually like a movie a lot better uh the first viewing I'm taking it in and noticing myself like how am I reacting to this my second viewing I'm looking at the film making like what did the what did the director do to generate this you and I begin to notice you know it's just the the the things that sort of matter like what are they doing with the editing what are they doing with the cinematography</p>

嗯，他们在表演方面做了什么？剧本中发生了什么？我真的很喜欢有趣的作者声音和敢于冒险的人。我发现看到那个领域中的创造性风险和实验令人兴奋，因为我们没有那么多这样的东西。我除了是教授之外，还是一名非虚构作家。非虚构写作中，我们没有像电影中那样多的实验，那些人会用大量的资金进行有趣的尝试。我认为这只是艺术中一个迷人的角落。

<p class="english-text">um what are they doing with the acting here what's happening in this screenplay like why and I I I I really love like interesting aitor voices and people who take interesting chances um it just I find it like creatively exhilarating to see the creative risks and experimentation that happen in that field because we don't have as much of that like I'm a non-fiction writer in addition to being a professor like non-fiction writing we don't have as much experimentation to the way you would see in like the movies like the people do interesting stuff with a huge amount of money on the line too I think it's just a fascinating corner of the Arts</p>

### 给年轻人的建议：尊重你的注意力

Cal，有成千上万的年轻人正在收听这个节目。作为年轻人，您会如何应对这件事？您会怎么做？首先，我想说，尊重你的注意力。在像我们现在这样的认知文化和经济中，这是你最重要的资源。你的注意力，你如何利用它，尊重你的注意力。所以，不要只是把它租给第一个出现的公司，他们说：“我们想租用你的注意力并将其货币化。看看我们的视频，滚动这个东西，这里有 TikTok、Instagram、Twitter。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ke um we got tens of thousands of uh young people listening to this so you're a young person how do you attack this this thing what do you do well first of all I'd say respect your attention right this is like your most important resource in a cognitive culture and economy like we have now is your attention like what you pay attention to what you do with that attention respect your attention so don't just rent it out to the first uh company that comes along and says we want to rent out your attention and monetize it look at our video scroll this thing here's a Tik Tok Instagram Twitter uh</p>
</details>

对你的注意力要有更多的尊重。比如，我真正想关注什么？我想读一些好东西，我想看一些有趣的东西，我想与面前的真实人物进行深入的交流，我想把我的工作做好。所以，仅仅将你的注意力视为值得你尊重的东西，而不是可以被所有试图从你的“活跃用户分钟数”中赚钱的人滥用和货币化的东西，这是一种完全不同的生活方式。当你不再不断分心时，我的一些读者告诉我，这就像你的生活从黑白变成了彩色。你开始注意到事物，理解事物，思考事物。

<p class="english-text">have more respect for your attention than that like what do I really want to pay attention to I want to like read something good I want to watch something interesting I want to connect deeply with a real person who's in front of me I want to do this thing in my job really well right so just just treating your attention as something that deserves your respect and not something that can just be AMU abused and monetized by everyone trying to make a dime off of like minutes of your active user minutes it's a completely different way of living when you're not just sort of constantly distracted I've had readers tell me it's like your life goes from black and white to Technicolor you're noticing things you're understanding things you're thinking about things</p>
</details>

所以，我不知道，这也许就是我对年轻人的总结：如果你尊重你的注意力，它会为你带来美好的事物。如果你不尊重，有很多人、很多公司、很多应用程序都在寻求利用你的注意力，你的生活将因此而变得困顿。所以，要审慎地利用你的时间。
