### 开篇：今日头条速览

From The New York Times, it's The Headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, October 15th. Here's what we're covering.

欢迎收听《纽约时报》头条新闻。我是特雷西·马姆福德。今天是10月15日，星期三。以下是我们将要报道的内容。

### 芝加哥：ICE执法加剧与民众反抗

>> He's not doing anything. He's not doing anything.

>> 他什么都没做。他什么都没做。

>> You need to stay over there.

>> 你需要待在那边。

In Chicago and the surrounding suburbs.

在芝加哥及其周边郊区。

>> He's a citizen.

>> 他是公民。

>> He's a citizen. A crackdown by federal immigration agents has been intensifying.

>> 他是公民。联邦移民局探员的打击行动正在加剧。

What started with a slow uptick in arrests has escalated rapidly, with agents sometimes in masks pulling up to people on sidewalks and detaining them.

最初逮捕人数缓慢上升，但现在已迅速升级，探员有时戴着面具，在人行道上拦住行人并将其拘留。

And the encounters are increasingly turning into open confrontations.

这些遭遇正日益演变成公开的对抗。

I've seen a lot of very aggressive tactics from federal agents who have fired tear gas and pepper balls at not just protesters, but at people on city streets who have formed crowds when they see people being arrested.

我看到联邦探员采取了许多非常激进的策略，他们不仅向抗议者发射催泪瓦斯和胡椒弹，还向那些在街上看到有人被捕而聚集起来的人群发射。

Julie Bosman is the Chicago bureau chief for The Times. She says just yesterday, **ICE** (**Immigration and Customs Enforcement**: 移民海关执法局) agents used tear gas on a crowd, apparently without warning.

朱莉·博斯曼是《泰晤士报》的芝加哥分社社长。她说，就在昨天，**ICE**（**移民海关执法局**：美国国土安全部下属的联邦执法机构）探员在没有明显警告的情况下，向人群使用了催泪瓦斯。

The scene was so chaotic that even police officers nearby were exposed, with one officer seen rinsing out his eyes with a garden hose.

现场一片混乱，就连附近的警察也受到影响，有人看到一名警官用花园水管冲洗眼睛。

In response to these aggressive tactics from federal agents, I think that regular Chicagoans are really pushing back.

面对联邦探员的这些激进策略，我认为普通的芝加哥市民正在强烈反击。

They crowd around when agents are making arrests. They organize on Facebook. They try to warn other people.

当探员进行逮捕时，他们会围拢起来。他们在脸书上组织活动。他们试图警告其他人。

I've heard a lot of honking horns when agents are spotted on the street, people blowing whistles when they see immigration agents. So, things just feel very tense and getting more tense here in Chicago.

我听到很多次，当街上发现探员时，汽车鸣笛示警；当人们看到移民探员时，会吹口哨。所以，芝加哥的气氛非常紧张，而且越来越紧张。

Julie says that the residents who have been pushing back and even organizing patrols of their own say they're trying to protect their neighbors and that they feel the city didn't need a surge of federal law enforcement.

朱莉说，那些进行反击甚至组织自己巡逻的居民表示，他们正试图保护邻居，并且认为这座城市不需要联邦执法力量的激增。

One city council member said, "Chicagoans are just trying to live their life. We're not going to tolerate unconstitutional authoritarianism."

一位市议会议员表示：“芝加哥人只是想过自己的生活。我们不会容忍违宪的专制主义。”

Federal authorities originally told local officials that they expected the operation in Chicago to last for 45 days, as they said they needed to find and arrest undocumented immigrants. There now appears to be no set end date.

联邦当局最初告诉地方官员，他们预计芝加哥的行动将持续45天，因为他们需要寻找并逮捕无证移民。但现在看来，行动没有确定的结束日期。

In the past few weeks, the Trump administration also deployed hundreds of **National Guard** (国民警卫队: 美国各州的准军事部队) troops to the Chicago area, saying they were needed to protect federal agents.

在过去几周，特朗普政府还向芝加哥地区部署了数百名**国民警卫队**（**National Guard**：美国各州的准军事部队，平时执行州内任务，战时可由联邦征召）士兵，称需要他们来保护联邦探员。

The effort was recently blocked temporarily by a **federal judge** (联邦法官: 由总统任命，经参议院批准的终身制法官) who accused the Trump administration of misrepresenting the facts on the ground to justify the deployment.

这项行动最近被一名**联邦法官**（**Federal Judge**：由总统任命并经参议院批准的终身制法官）暂时阻止，该法官指责特朗普政府歪曲当地事实以证明此次部署的合理性。

### 特朗普政府的三项最新动态

Now, three other quick updates on the Trump administration. Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government.

现在，关于特朗普政府还有另外三个简短的最新消息。国会中的民主党人拒绝为联邦政府提供资金。

And because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our **TSA** (**Transportation Security Administration**: 运输安全管理局) employees are working without pay.

因此，我们的许多业务受到影响，我们大部分**TSA**（**运输安全管理局**：美国国土安全部下属机构，负责机场安检等运输安全）员工都在无薪工作。

As the government shutdown hits the two-week mark, the president and his team are turning up the political pressure on Democrats.

随着政府停摆进入第二周，总统及其团队正在加大对民主党人的政治压力。

Kristi Noem, the Secretary of Homeland Security, recently asked airports across the country to play a video on TV screens near security checkpoints that blames the shutdown on Democrats.

国土安全部长克里斯蒂·诺姆最近要求全国各地的机场在安检口附近的电视屏幕上播放一段视频，指责民主党人造成了政府停摆。

A number of airports, however, have refused to show the video, saying it's overly partisan and potentially even a violation of the **Hatch Act** (哈奇法案: 限制联邦雇员政治活动的法律), a law intended to limit political activities by federal employees.

然而，许多机场拒绝播放该视频，称其过于党派化，甚至可能违反了**哈奇法案**（**Hatch Act**：旨在限制联邦雇员政治活动的法律），该法律旨在限制联邦雇员的政治活动。

Meanwhile,

同时，

>> Honestly, can I put it in plain words for you? Trump is ramping up his efforts to fire federal workers and slash government programs, claiming the shutdown's given him an "unprecedented opportunity" for that.

>> 说实话，我能用直白的话告诉你吗？特朗普正在加紧努力解雇联邦工作人员并削减政府项目，声称政府停摆给了他一个“前所未有的机会”。

>> So, we are closing up Democrat programs that we think that we disagree with and they're never going to open again.

>> 所以，我们正在关闭那些我们认为不认同的民主党项目，它们将永远不会再开放。

In the past two weeks, the administration has frozen or canceled nearly $28 billion for more than 200 projects primarily in Democratic cities and states — everything from subway upgrades in New York to renewable energy projects in California and Washington state.

在过去两周内，政府冻结或取消了近280亿美元用于200多个项目，这些项目主要集中在民主党执政的城市和州，涵盖了从纽约的地铁升级到加利福尼亚州和华盛顿州的**可再生能源**项目。

At the same time, the White House has used creative accounting to keep funding flowing to politically sensitive areas that could have otherwise triggered blowback, like military salaries and food assistance for low-income families.

与此同时，白宫利用巧妙的会计手段，继续向那些原本可能引发强烈反弹的政治敏感领域提供资金，例如军人薪水和低收入家庭的食品援助。

Also,

另外，

>> He's MAGA all the way. Make Argentina great again. I heard...

>> 他完全是“让阿根廷再次伟大”的拥护者。我听说……

Trump hosted the president of Argentina, **Javier Milei** (哈维尔·米莱: 阿根廷现任总统), yesterday as the administration says it's moving forward with a controversial $20 billion bailout of the country, which has been in financial crisis.

特朗普昨天接待了阿根廷总统**哈维尔·米莱**（**Javier Milei**：阿根廷现任总统），政府表示正推进一项备受争议的200亿美元对该国的援助计划，该国一直处于金融危机之中。

Trump has described Milei as his favorite president, saying, "I love him because he loves Trump."

特朗普将米莱描述为他最喜欢的总统，称：“我爱他，因为他爱特朗普。”

The White House has said the bailout is needed to stabilize Argentina's economy, though Trump also said the money was contingent on Milei's party winning upcoming elections.

白宫表示，这项援助是稳定阿根廷经济所必需的，尽管特朗普也曾表示，这笔钱取决于米莱的政党能否赢得即将到来的选举。

Critics of the plan, however, including many Democratic lawmakers, say the financial lifeline is effectively a gift to **hedge funds** (对冲基金: 一种高风险高回报的投资工具) and wealthy Americans who've invested heavily in Argentina, including friends of **Treasury Secretary** (财政部长: 负责国家财政政策的政府官员) Scott Bessant.

然而，该计划的批评者，包括许多民主党议员，表示这项金融援助实际上是对那些在阿根廷大量投资的**对冲基金**（**Hedge Funds**：一种采用多种投资策略，旨在对冲市场风险并追求绝对回报的私人投资基金）和富裕美国人的馈赠，其中包括**财政部长**（**Treasury Secretary**：负责国家财政政策、税收和国库管理的政府高级官员）斯科特·贝桑特的朋友。

And last update:

最后一个更新：

>> Today, we're here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, a beloved leader who galvanized

>> 今天，我们在此缅怀并纪念一位无畏的自由战士，一位激励了下一代并备受爱戴的领导人。

the next generation like nobody I've ever seen before.

他激励下一代的方式是我前所未见的。

In the Rose Garden yesterday, Trump posthumously awarded the **Presidential Medal of Freedom** (总统自由勋章: 美国最高平民荣誉) to Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist who was assassinated last month.

昨天在玫瑰园，特朗普追授了**总统自由勋章**（**Presidential Medal of Freedom**：美国最高平民荣誉奖项）给查理·柯克，这位上个月被刺杀的保守派活动家。

Trump called Kirk, the founder of the right-wing political group **Turning Point USA** (美国转折点: 一个美国保守派学生团体), a martyr for truth and for freedom.

特朗普称柯克（右翼政治团体**美国转折点**（**Turning Point USA**：一个旨在推广保守主义价值观和政策的美国学生政治团体）的创始人）是真理和自由的烈士。

Trump and other Republicans have credited Kirk with helping them win office by mobilizing young voters.

特朗普和其他共和党人认为柯克通过动员年轻选民，帮助他们赢得了选举。

The president has said he also plans to award the Medal of Freedom to Ben Carson, the former housing secretary, and Rudy Giuliani.

总统表示，他还计划将自由勋章授予前住房部长本·卡森和鲁迪·朱利安尼。

### 蛋白补充剂铅超标：健康隐忧

A new report has found that a lot of popular protein supplements – think of the powders and drinks that have popped up everywhere these days – contain levels of lead that could pose health concerns.

一份新报告发现，许多流行的**蛋白补充剂**（指现在随处可见的蛋白粉和蛋白饮品）中含有可能引起健康问题的铅含量。

**Consumer Reports** (消费者报告: 美国消费者联盟出版的杂志) tested 23 different products and found that over two-thirds of them had more lead per serving than the standard set by the state of California, which has a strict guideline on **lead consumption** (铅摄入量: 指人体通过食物、水或空气吸收铅的量).

**消费者报告**（**Consumer Reports**：由美国消费者联盟出版的杂志，提供产品评测和建议）测试了23种不同的产品，发现超过三分之二的产品每份铅含量高于加利福尼亚州设定的标准，该州对**铅摄入量**（**Lead Consumption**：人体通过各种途径吸收铅的总量）有严格的指导方针。

At least a few products had more than 10 times that amount.

至少有几款产品的铅含量超过该标准的10倍。

According to the report, there's no reason to panic. There's no risk of immediate harm from the products, but extended use may be unsafe.

报告称，没有理由恐慌。这些产品不会立即造成伤害，但长期使用可能不安全。

Lead is highly toxic and can accumulate in the body over time.

铅具有剧毒，并会随着时间在体内积累。

Children are at especially high risk for developing developmental delays or even seizures from lead exposure.

儿童因接触铅而出现发育迟缓甚至癫痫的风险尤其高。

Health experts not involved with the testing called the results troubling.

未参与测试的健康专家称这些结果令人担忧。

One said he was "appalled" that companies weren't checking their supply chains well enough to avoid these levels of lead contamination.

一位专家表示，他对企业未能充分检查其供应链以避免如此高水平的铅污染感到“震惊”。

In the U.S., supplements like protein powder are not regulated in the same way that food and drugs are.

在美国，蛋白粉等补充剂的监管方式与食品和药品不同。

With that light oversight in mind, one doctor told The Times consumers should weigh whether the risk of supplements is worth it, since there are other ways to get protein.

考虑到这种宽松的监管，一位医生告诉《泰晤士报》，消费者应该权衡补充剂的风险是否值得，因为还有其他方式可以获取蛋白质。

### 伦敦手机盗窃案：产业化犯罪

And finally,

最后，

>> It's a major problem. Criminals riding up on **ebikes** (电动自行车: 以电池驱动提供辅助动力的自行车) and literally nicking devices out of people's hands.

>> 这是一个大问题。罪犯骑着**电动自行车**（**E-bikes**：配备电池和电动机，为骑行提供辅助动力的自行车），直接从人们手中抢走设备。

>> I've just put my phone against my chest. I'm thinking, "No, not me. Not at 9:00 a.m. Like I'm just..."

>> 我刚刚把手机贴在胸前。我在想，“不，不是我。不是在早上9点。我只是……”

In recent years, London has earned a reputation as one of the phone theft capitals of the world.

近年来，伦敦赢得了“世界手机盗窃之都”的恶名。

>> A mobile phone is snatched every 15 minutes in this part of London alone.

>> 仅在伦敦的这一区域，每15分钟就有一部手机被抢走。

Social media is flooded with warnings about staying alert.

社交媒体上充斥着关于保持警惕的警告。

>> Guys, my phone nearly got stolen today. No, it's actually not funny.

>> 伙计们，我的手机今天差点被偷了。不，这真的一点都不好笑。

Along with surveillance footage of theft after theft on busy streets in broad daylight, the culprits zipping away.

此外还有大量监控录像，显示光天化日之下，在繁忙的街道上，盗窃案接连发生，罪犯迅速逃离。

Some experts say part of what's made it so common in Britain is the fact that police budgets were slashed in the last decade to the point that police in London said they would stop investigating minor crimes when there was a low chance of catching anyone.

一些专家表示，这种现象在英国如此普遍的部分原因是，过去十年警方预算被大幅削减，以至于伦敦警方表示，当抓捕到任何人的可能性很低时，他们将停止调查轻微犯罪。

Now though, after 80,000 phones were stolen in the last year alone, police in London are trying to tackle the problem.

不过，在去年一年就有8万部手机被盗之后，伦敦警方正试图解决这个问题。

And some of what they've uncovered points to an industrial-level criminal operation.

他们所揭露的一些情况表明，这是一场工业规模的犯罪活动。

They say there are three tiers to it. The thieves at the bottom wearing **balaclavas** (巴拉克拉瓦帽: 一种覆盖头部和颈部的头套) on ebikes.

他们说这有三个层级。最底层是那些骑着电动自行车，戴着**巴拉克拉瓦帽**（**Balaclavas**：一种覆盖头部和颈部，只露出眼睛或部分面部的头套）的窃贼。

They then sell the stolen phones to shopkeepers and other middlemen.

然后他们将偷来的手机卖给店主和其他中间商。

And at the top of the network are exporters.

而在这个网络的顶端是出口商。

Police say they found that a lot of the stolen phones are being shipped overseas and have identified a group they say was responsible for sending almost 40,000 phones to China, where they can be resold for a large profit.

警方表示，他们发现许多被盗手机被运往海外，并已查明一个团伙，他们称该团伙负责将近4万部手机运往中国，在那里可以高价转售获利。

When police arrested two men who they say were ringleaders for sending a lot of the phones overseas, they found several phones in their car wrapped in foil, an attempt to try and block the signals from people trying to use the **Find My iPhone** (查找我的iPhone: 苹果公司提供的手机定位功能) feature before the thieves could get them out of the country.

当警方逮捕了两名他们称是向海外走私大量手机的头目时，在他们的车里发现了用锡纸包裹的几部手机，这是为了在窃贼将手机运出国外之前，试图阻止他人使用**查找我的iPhone**（**Find My iPhone**：苹果公司提供的一项手机定位和远程管理功能）功能发出的信号。

Police later said that the men had gone to Costco at one point and bought over a mile and a half of tinfoil.

警方后来表示，这些男子曾一度前往好市多（Costco）购买了超过一英里半（约2.4公里）的锡纸。

### 结语与额外新闻

Those are the headlines today on The Daily. President Trump's border chief, **Tom Homan** (汤姆·霍曼: 美国移民海关执法局前代理局长), was recorded on camera last year accepting $50,000 in cash in an undercover **FBI** (**Federal Bureau of Investigation**: 联邦调查局) investigation, according to people familiar with the case.

以上是今天《每日》节目的头条新闻。据知情人士透露，特朗普总统的边境事务负责人**汤姆·霍曼**（**Tom Homan**：美国移民海关执法局前代理局长）去年在一次**FBI**（**联邦调查局**：美国主要的联邦执法机构）的卧底调查中，被拍到收受5万美元现金。

The investigation was then closed under Trump, and administration officials have been sidestepping questions about it.

这项调查在特朗普任内被关闭，政府官员一直回避有关此事的提问。

My colleague Devon Barrett walks through what happened. You can listen to that in The New York Times app or wherever you get your podcasts.

我的同事德文·巴雷特将详细讲述事件经过。您可以在《纽约时报》应用程序或任何您收听播客的平台收听。
