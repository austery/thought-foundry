title: 喜剧演员谈育儿、幸福与性：联合国报告的另类解读
summary: 喜剧演员内金·法萨德（Negin Farsad）以幽默风趣的方式，分享了她作为伊朗裔美国穆斯林母亲的育儿经历，包括她发现波斯语中缺乏“我为你骄傲”的表达。随后，她辛辣地解读了联合国全球幸福报告，指出美国年轻人不幸福的原因是缺乏性生活。她以一种戏谑的爱国主义号召，鼓励美国人为了国家荣誉，积极投身“性战场”，以提升国民幸福感。

### 喜剧演员的自我介绍与TED演讲的奥秘

**TED**（Technology, Entertainment, Design: 旨在传播“值得传播的创意”的全球性大会）真是深谙“喜剧在早上九点表现最佳”这句老话的精髓。（笑声）但我非常高兴能来到这里。作为一名喜剧演员，我觉得我的职责是向大家解释，究竟是什么造就了一位TED演讲者？这些人是如何变得如此出色的？我将通过介绍一些关于我自己的情况来做到这一点。

<p class="english-text">TED really leans into that adage that comedy does best at nine in o'clock the morning. (Laughter) But I'm so excited to be here. And as a comedian, I feel like it's my job to explain to you guys what makes a TED speaker. Like, how did these people become so incredible? And I'm going to do that by explaining a little bit about myself.</p>
</details>

我是一名伊朗裔——是的，谢谢，我非常出色。（笑声）不，我是一名伊朗裔美国穆斯林，就像你们所有人一样。（笑声）我有一个孩子，这个孩子是和丈夫一起出现的，算是一种“套餐交易”。所以我结婚了。我其实没戴婚戒。我几乎从不戴婚戒，因为我不想让我丈夫产生误解，你们懂我的意思吧？但是我的……（笑声）我的丈夫是黑人，就像我说的，我是伊朗人，这让我们的孩子成了“黑伊混血儿”（Blaranian）。我们在所有**DEI**（多元化、公平和包容性禁令: 指某些地方政府或机构限制或禁止多元化、公平和包容性倡议的政策）禁令出台之前就有了她，所以我们当时并不知道。但是……（笑声）我应该提一下，我用**波斯语**（Farsi: 伊朗的官方语言）和她说话，因为我正试图“激进化”她，这显然会是一个两人“沉睡者细胞”组织。而且……她还会说西班牙语，因为她在双语学校上学，当然，她也会说英语，和她那个只会说一种语言的“笨爸爸”一起。

<p class="english-text">So I'm an Iranian -- Yeah, thank you, I'm incredible. (Laughter) No. So I'm an Iranian-American Muslim, like all of you. (Laughter) And I have a kid, and the kid came with a husband. It was a sort of combo deal. So I am married. I'm actually not wearing my wedding ring. I almost never wear my wedding ring because it -- I don't want my husband to get the wrong idea. You know what I mean? But my ... (Laughter) My husband is Black, and like I said, I'm Iranian, which makes our baby "Blaranian." We had her before all of the DEI bans, so we didn't know. But ... (Laughter) I should mention that I speak to her in Farsi because I'm trying to radicalize her, and it's -- It'll be a two-person sleeper cell, obviously. And ... She also speaks Spanish because she's in a bilingual school, and of course, she speaks English you know, with her dumb dad, who only speaks one language.</p>

### 育儿智慧：波斯语中“我为你骄傲”的缺失

而且……当你成为父母后，你会学到很多关于自己的东西，对吧？有一天我在游乐场，我学到了一些东西。当她滑下滑梯时，她大约13个月大，她自己滑了下去。我当时想用波斯语告诉她：“我为你骄傲。”当我准备说出口时，我才意识到，我不知道波斯语里“我为你骄傲”怎么说，这说明在我与父母同住的18年里，他们从未有过机会说“我为你骄傲”。我不得不打电话给我表姐，她真的得好好想一想。她甚至做了一些研究，深入挖掘古代鲁米（Rumi）的诗歌，才找到一个近似于“我为你骄傲”的短语。这根本不是伊朗人会说的话。又不是**阿亚图拉·霍梅尼**（Ayatollah Khomeini: 伊朗伊斯兰共和国的创始人和最高领袖）会到处说“我为你骄傲”，你们懂我的意思吧？这个短语大概是随着制裁一起被取消了，你们懂的。所以……我的意思是，我从未被告知“我为你骄傲”。而现在，我成了一名喜剧演员。所以……（笑声）这就解释了TED演讲者，解释了整个媒体帝国是如何建立起来的。所以，我对你们所有人的育儿建议是：克制，好吗？我们不需要听到那些赞美。克制。

<p class="english-text">And ... You learn a lot about yourself when you become a parent, right? And one day I was at the playground, and I learned something. When she went down the slide, she's about 13 months old, and she went down the slide by herself. And I wanted to tell her, in Farsi, "I'm proud of you." And as I went to say that, I realized, I don't know how to say "I'm proud of you" in Farsi, which suggests that in the 18 years I lived with my parents, they never once had occasion to say, "I'm proud of you." I had to call my cousin, she really had to think about it. She did some research, digging into, like, ancient Rumi poems to find an approximate phrase for "I'm proud." It's just not something Iranians say. It's not like the Ayatollah Khomeini was out there being like, "I'm proud of you." You know what I mean? The phrase got taken out with the sanctions, you know? And so ... My point is, I was never told "I'm proud of you." And now I'm a comedian. So ... (Laughter) That explains TED speakers. That explains how this entire media empire was built. So my parenting advice for all of you is, withhold, OK? We don't need to hear the compliments. Withhold.</p>

### 联合国全球幸福报告与年轻人的“性”福缺失

但我真正喜欢TED的一点是，这里的每个人都在努力让世界变得更美好，对吧？是的，这太棒了，太了不起了。（掌声）我也想提出我的一个想法。但请记住，我是一个“邋遢的”喜剧演员。尽管如此，我有一个指示。它与幸福有关。因为最近**联合国**（United Nations: 致力于促进国际合作和实现世界和平的国际组织）发布了**《全球幸福报告》**（Global Happiness Report: 一份衡量全球幸福水平的年度报告）。美国已经跌出了最幸福国家的前20名。你们惊讶吗？（笑声）在加拿大人得意之前，你们的排名也下降了。（笑声）我们排名下降的原因是30岁以下的人，好吗？30岁以下的人不快乐。根据数据显示，他们不快乐是因为他们不出去社交，也不发生性关系。好的，他们没有性生活。

<p class="english-text">But one of the things I really love about TED is that everyone here is trying to make the world a better place, right? And yes, it's fantastic. It's amazing. (Applause) And I also want to throw one of my ideas into the ring. But please keep in mind, I'm a dirtbag comedian. But nevertheless, I have a directive. And it has to do with happiness. Because recently the United Nations released its Global Happiness Report. The United States has dropped out of the top 20 of happiest countries. Are you guys surprised? (Laughter) And before the Canadians get smug, you guys also dropped in your rankings. (Laughter) And so the reason we've dropped in our rankings is because of people under 30, OK? People under 30 are unhappy. And according to the data, they're unhappy because they're not going out and they're not having sex. OK, they're not having sex.</p>

### 幽默的爱国主义号召：为国家而战，为性而战

听着，我不想听起来像个老古董，但在我那个年代，我过去常常出去和遇到的每一个陌生人发生性关系，在我那个年代。在我那个年代，我得了所有的性病，这样Z世代才能腾飞，在我那个年代。有时我甚至得打印出**MapQuest**（MapQuest: 早期流行的在线地图服务）的路线图去赴一场一夜情，在我那个年代。有时我不会回复醉酒短信，因为我把触控笔弄丢了，好吗，在我那个年代。现在，在我20多岁的时候，我清楚地感觉到像**格洛丽亚·斯泰纳姆**（Gloria Steinem: 美国著名的女权主义者、记者和社会政治活动家）这样的人为我奋斗，这样我就可以出去进行无差别的性行为。她向华盛顿进军，这样我就可以走向一个更幸福的社会，即使是“羞耻之行”。（笑声和掌声）现在……美国表现不佳，但你们知道谁是幸福排名第一吗？**芬兰**（Finland: 长期位居联合国全球幸福报告榜首的国家国家之一）。我们要让芬兰在“性愉悦”方面超越美利坚合众国吗？什么？我们算什么爱国者？我们应该像性战场上的士兵一样冲锋陷阵。避孕套、意外怀孕、事后避孕药，渴望自由呼吸。八十七根阴茎之前——（笑声）我可能和这个房间里的某个人睡过——（笑声）我这样做是为了上帝，为了国家。（笑声）

<p class="english-text">Now, look, I don't mean to sound like an old fuddy-duddy, but in my day, I used to go out and have sex with every stranger I could find, in my day. In my day, I went and I got all the STDs so that Gen Z could soar, in my day. Sometimes I had to print out the MapQuest directions to a one night stand, in my day. Sometimes I wouldn't respond to a drunk text message because I lost my stylus, OK, in my day. Now look, in my 20s, I had the distinct feeling that people like Gloria Steinem fought for me so that I could go out and have indiscriminate sex. She marched on Washington so that I could do a walk of shame towards a happier society. (Laughter and applause) Now ... The United States is not doing so great, but do you know who's number one on the happiness rankings? Finland. We're going to let Finland out-pleasure the United States of America? What? What kind of patriots are we? We should be out there like soldiers on the sexual battlefield. The condoms, the whoopsies, the morning-after pills yearning to breathe free. Fourscore and seven dicks ago -- (Laughter) I probably slept with someone in this room and -- (Laughter) And I did it for God, and I did it for country. (Laughter)</p>

### 最终的育儿智慧：人生中“做什么”不如“和谁做”

听着，我知道你们可能会想：“天哪，她真是个脱节、脾气暴躁的老家伙。”我知道这听起来像是我在说“哦，别在我草坪上乱搞”，但那不是我的意思。我真正想说的是，“在我草坪上尽情享受吧！”（笑声）而且……（笑声）看，各位，我——你们看，我只是一个普通的家长，好吗？一个普通的妈妈，从所有这些材料中你们就能看出来。我必须把一些智慧传授给我的女儿。所以，当我正在实施第一个教训——克制，带着一丝丝的忽视——的同时，我也会教她一个关于全球幸福的关键教训。那就是：生活中你做什么并不重要，重要的是你和谁一起做。非常感谢大家。谢谢。（欢呼和掌声）

<p class="english-text">Now listen, I know you guys are like, "Man, she's an out of touch, crotchety old geezer up there." And I know it sounds like I'm saying, like, "Oh, get off my lawn," but that's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is, "Get off on my lawn" (Laughter) And ... (Laughter) Look, you guys, I -- Look, as you can tell, I'm just an average parent, OK? A regular mom, as you can tell from all of this material. And I have to impart some wisdom to my daughter. So while I'm, you know, implementing the first lesson, which is withhold, with a soupçon of neglect, I'll also be teaching her a critical lesson about global happiness. Which is that it doesn't matter what you do in life, it matters who you do. Thank you so much. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)</p>
