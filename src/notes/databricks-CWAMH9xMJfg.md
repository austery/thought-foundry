### 卖掉公司还是坚持到底？一个关键时刻的抉择

I was like, maybe they're right. Maybe we should just sell. And I remember having that conversation with Ben, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. You can sell. You're going to make a lot of money and you'll be super successful in life, but you know, if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, you know, I missed that one shot. That was the one thing I should have taken it all the way. Now I'll never know how far I could have taken it." Could have been.

Ali: 我当时在想，也许他们是对的，也许我们应该直接卖掉公司。我记得与本（Ben）有过那次对话，他说：“嘿，你想怎么做都行。你可以卖掉公司，你会赚很多钱，人生也会非常成功。但是，如果你像我一样，你会在余生中回想，我错过了那一次机会。那是我本该坚持到底的一件事。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。”也许会是那样。

Ben: So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? You know, I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less.

Ben: 那么，你是想带着这种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有这笔钱？你知道，无论你做什么，我都会支持。我真的无所谓。

### 重新启动“老板谈话”与DataBricks的早期挑战

a16z: Excited to bring back Boss Talk. This was a series that you guys did a few years ago on Clubhouse that was a big hit.

a16z: 很高兴能再次推出“老板谈话”系列。这是你们几年前在 Clubhouse 上做的一个非常受欢迎的节目。

Ali: Yeah, we had fun. It was Ben's idea.

Ali: 是的，我们玩得很开心。那是本的主意。

a16z: Yeah. Excited to bring it back. So, in the spirit of boss talk, let's talk about the first time that you became a boss in terms of running DataBricks. Let's talk about the moment in 2016 when DataBricks was not—things weren't as smooth as perhaps they should have been—and we were looking for a new CEO. And Ben, you recommended Ali. First of all, like, kudos to Yan for building the company originally. And Ben, you know, investing and believing in us. And then also, I kind of couldn't have done the CEO job. Ben basically babysat me the first couple years.

a16z: 是的，很高兴能把它带回来。那么，本着“老板谈话”的精神，我们来谈谈你第一次作为老板运营 **DataBricks** 的经历。我们来聊聊2016年，当时 DataBricks 的情况并不如预期顺利，我们正在寻找一位新的首席执行官（CEO），而本推荐了阿里。首先，要赞扬颜（Yan）最初创建了公司，以及本对我们的投资和信任。另外，我当时其实无法胜任 CEO 的工作。本在前几年基本上是“照看”着我。

Ali: You know, so, but I did know what was kind of wrong with the company because I had been there for two, three years and I had seen from inside, you know, what we should change and what the issues were. But we had an **open-source** (开源: 软件代码可公开获取、使用、修改和分发) project that actually became very successful thanks to those first two, three years.

Ali: 所以，但我确实知道公司出了什么问题，因为我已经在那儿待了两三年，并且从内部看到了我们应该改变什么以及存在的问题。但我们有一个开源项目，正是因为前两三年的努力，它变得非常成功。

a16z: **Apache Spark** (Apache Spark: 一个用于大数据工作负载的开源分布式处理系统) became a worldwide sensation, and we could pride ourselves on the number of downloads of the software.

a16z: Apache Spark 成为了全球性的轰动，我们可以为软件的下载量感到自豪。

Ali: Well, and the Spark conference. Yeah.

Ali: 还有 Spark 大会。是的。

a16z: Yeah. Spark conference.

a16z: 是的。Spark 大会。

Ali: Now the Data and AI conference.

Ali: 现在是数据与人工智能（AI）大会。

Ali: Yeah. But the problem was that, you know, as it is often with open source, everyone's just downloading the open-source version. Actually, your biggest enemy is your open-source project. The main thing you have to fight in the market is, "Hey, why can't I just download the open-source version? Amazon is offering it. The cloud vendors are just offering it. I'm just going to use that."

Ali: 是的。但问题在于，你知道，开源项目常常如此，每个人都只是下载开源版本。实际上，你最大的敌人就是你的开源项目。你在市场上必须对抗的主要问题是：“嘿，我为什么不能只下载开源版本？亚马逊正在提供，云服务商也在提供，我直接用那个就好了。”

Ali: So this was the biggest challenge that DataBricks had at the time, and we needed to do very serious, aggressive pivots internally, which were going to be very, very painful to lots of people, like to the whole ethos of the company internally. And so I kind of knew that for almost a year. So when I got the shot, that's kind of like what we started doing.

Ali: 所以，这是 DataBricks 当时面临的最大挑战，我们需要在内部进行非常认真、激进的转型，这对于很多人来说，对于公司内部的整体精神来说，都将非常非常痛苦。我差不多有一年时间都知道这一点。所以当我获得机会时，这就是我们开始做的事情。

Ben: The strategy was like, make Spark the biggest open-source thing. I mean, I can remember it on all the slides now, and then, you know, DataBricks would have the best Spark. But we never—DataBricks never had like necessarily—we didn't do a lot to make it the best Spark or not differentiated enough, and that was kind of the first thing Ali did on the product side. And then he hired Ron Gabrisco, which that was transformational because that kind of dragged the company into the world. Yeah.

Ben: 策略是让 Spark 成为最大的开源项目。我记得当时所有的幻灯片上都写着，然后 DataBricks 会拥有最好的 Spark。但我们从未真正做到——DataBricks 从未致力于——我们没有做很多事情来让它成为最好的 Spark，或者说没有足够的差异化，而这正是阿里在产品方面做的第一件事。然后他雇佣了罗恩·加布里斯科（Ron Gabrisco），那是一个变革性的举动，因为它把公司带入了市场。是的。

### 阿里作为CEO的超能力

a16z: So obviously that was the right decision and paid off. Maybe zooming out. Ben, you've worked with and you know all the great CEOs of our time and worked with them. Where does Ali spike in? Where are his superpowers as a CEO, as a boss, that have helped contribute to the impact?

a16z: 所以这显然是正确的决定，并且得到了回报。也许我们把视角拉远一点。本，你曾与我们这个时代所有伟大的首席执行官（CEO）合作过，也认识他们。阿里在哪里表现出色？他作为 CEO、作为老板的超能力在哪里，这些超能力如何帮助他产生了影响力？

Ben: I mean, Ali's really good. So like I always rate CEOs. So it's like, okay, if I was running that company, would I do a better job or a worse job? And with DataBricks, I'd do a way worse job. So, so he's good on many, many dimensions. So, I'd say first of all, you know, he is a real technologist, like not a, you know, pseudo technologist, like his competitors, I'm sorry. So he really knows the product. He understands the product strategy in detail. He also ran engineering before he was CEO. You know, mostly what I worked on him with in the early days was just, okay, **go-to-market** (进入市场策略: 公司将产品或服务推向市场的计划) and **BD** (业务拓展: 识别新商机、建立伙伴关系以促进增长的活动). And he's really good at both of those. You know, that's where we had to catch up. You know, Snowflake had an amazing go-to-market. And then we needed a big deal with, you know, kind of big partners. And every time I got him like a little BD tutor, John O'Farrell, who did a nice job, came in and kind of taught Ali about how you structure a deal, how you do things. But he learned everything so fast. And then probably the thing that he does that is—I wish I could get all our CEOs to do—is he doesn't hesitate. He trusts his eye. Like he'll see something and he doesn't know if it's right. And so if you look at the strategy changes DataBricks has had, you know, one big one was building a data warehouse. Like that is a pretty big swing and a seemingly quixotic, insane idea given where they were. But you know, he both knew—he's paranoid enough that he knew that that could be an issue, and then he trusted himself enough to go get deep enough to decide whether to do it or not, as opposed to, you know, ignore it like, "These guys are trying to kill me. I don't want to see it," which is what a lot of CEOs do. And you know, so that kind of thing. But there's a lot of elements to that job. It's a very complicated job.

Ben: 我的意思是，阿里真的很棒。我总是这样评价 CEO：如果我来经营那家公司，我会做得更好还是更糟？而对于 DataBricks，我会做得糟得多。所以，他在很多很多方面都很优秀。首先，他是一位真正的技术专家，不像他的竞争对手那样是“伪技术专家”，抱歉。他非常了解产品，详细理解产品策略。在担任 CEO 之前，他也曾负责工程部门。你知道，早期我主要和他一起处理的是市场进入策略（go-to-market）和业务拓展（BD）。在这两方面他都非常出色。我们当时需要在这方面迎头赶上。你知道，Snowflake 有一个非常棒的市场进入策略。然后我们需要与大型合作伙伴达成大宗交易。每次我都会给他找一位 BD 导师，约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）做得很好，他会过来教阿里如何构建交易、如何处理事务。但他学得非常快。然后，他最让我希望所有 CEO 都能做到的事情是，他从不犹豫。他相信自己的判断。他会看到一些东西，即使他不知道那是否正确。如果你看看 DataBricks 经历过的战略变革，其中一个重大举动是构建数据仓库。考虑到他们当时所处的位置，这绝对是一个大胆的尝试，一个看似异想天开的疯狂想法。但他既知道——他足够多疑，知道那可能是一个问题，然后他又足够相信自己，深入研究，决定是否去做，而不是像许多 CEO 那样，选择忽视它，觉得“这些人想搞垮我，我不想看到它”。但这份工作有很多要素，它非常复杂。

a16z: Ali, talk about more about the journey, about, you know, evolving from an academic, a technologist to someone commercial. It's a journey our CEOs go through. Talk about what it was like for you in the context of what others can learn from it.

a16z: 阿里，多谈谈你的历程，从一名学者、技术专家演变为一位商业人士。这是我们所有 CEO 都会经历的旅程。结合你的经验，谈谈其他人能从中学习到什么。

### 从学者到CEO的转型：学习与团队建设

Ali: Yeah, I mean, so we were in academia, so we were, you know, scientists. And then, you know, I led engineering and product, so you got to learn how to build a product and get product-market fit. And then I became CEO afterwards. Each of these has different sort of challenges. I think that in all of them, the thing that is in common is that you really have to understand and be extremely good at the task at hand. And so number one, admit that you don't actually know everything about the job. So, like, you know, first step of anonymous alcoholics, like admit you have a problem. Okay. And then number two, be a student and learn everything you can about it. Right? Go all the way down to the details and try to learn from the best. And then, you know, work your butt off. Like, you know, you're, you know, nothing, you're zero, right? It's like, you know, nothing about writing reliable software. So I think for that's—I would say that's was the same thing. I tried to learn. I tried to network with the best heads of engineering, with the best heads of products. I tried to read every book. You know, I got as much as I could out of Ben and Mark. I read all of their blogs, all of their books, everybody else's. But then, you know, you do search and you start, you know, search firms are really great at getting you to meet who's the number one product manager by reputation in the market right now. Can you get 30 minutes with that person? Just sit down. They're not going to join you because your company is too crappy and too small. Can you get 30 minutes with them? You know, can you get a dinner with them? Can you get a breakfast with them? And then just ask them lots and lots and lots of dumb questions and they'll tell you. They'll happily just tell you like, "Hey, here's how I run. You know, here's how I do it. The other guys are wrong." And then, you know, they'll give you a playbook and you can go compare it. You can go to the next person and say, "Hey, this is the playbook I heard from like, 'No, no, that's totally wrong. You don't do it that way. Here's how I do it.'" And then, you know, very soon you learn enough. And if you, you know, really have grit and you work hard, you're going to be able to do great things. That's about you yourself. But also, if you hire a great team, because as a leader, you know, you alone can't do much. So can you hire the best people out there? So that's also part of that. Do you know what great looks like? Have you interviewed all the best people? And then can you now sell them and get the best people to come work for you? Once you start assembling a team of excellent people, then they will uplift you. This is a managerial leverage that I learned from Ben, which is from High Output Management by Andy Grove. But it's basically, are they so great that you're learning from them? Like, you know, it's like Ali was a great head of engineering, but actually he was a great head of engineering because the people that worked underneath me were doing amazing things, and that was I was just standing on their shoulders. So you just have to do that and you have to instill everybody else to do that recursively so that you end up with a just, you know, amazing killer team, and you got to continue doing that. Now you have to, okay, for engineering, it wasn't actually that hard because I had written a lot of software. But now you're CEO, so now you have to do that for marketing, you have to do that for sales, where, you know, they were super helpful because they had done it with LoudCloud and Opsware, so they knew how to build a **B2B** (企业对企业: 指企业间进行的商业交易) machine, how the game was played. But you have to do it again, but now you're doing it in a field where you're really clueless, and also probably all of your instincts are wrong, and your intuition is completely wrong. So can you be clairvoyant and see the truth, or do you want to lie to yourself? And that's where I think a lot of founders make mistakes. Like they'll do well in their own archetype. When they have to step outside of their own archetype, they make a mistake. They hire people that are like their own archetype in other roles where that could be lethal. So,

Ali: 是的，我的意思是，我们当时在学术界，所以我们是科学家。然后，我领导了工程和产品部门，所以你必须学习如何构建产品并实现产品与市场的契合。之后我才成为 CEO。这些角色各有不同的挑战。我认为所有这些角色都有一个共同点，那就是你必须真正理解并极其擅长手头的任务。所以第一点，承认你并不真正了解这份工作的方方面面。就像，你知道，匿名戒酒会的第一步，就是承认你有问题。好的。然后第二点，成为一名学生，学习所有你能学到的东西。对吧？深入到细节，努力向最优秀的人学习。然后，你知道，拼命工作。就像，你一无所知，你是零，对吧？就像你对编写可靠的软件一无所知。所以我觉得那也是一样的。我努力学习。我努力与最优秀的工程主管、最优秀的产品主管建立联系。我努力阅读每一本书。你知道，我从本和马克那里学到了尽可能多的东西。我阅读了他们所有的博客、所有的书，以及其他所有人的。但之后，你知道，你进行搜索，然后你开始，你知道，猎头公司在帮助你见到市场中声誉最好的产品经理方面非常出色。你能和那个人聊 30 分钟吗？就坐下来。他们不会加入你的公司，因为你的公司太烂太小了。你能和他们聊 30 分钟吗？你知道，你能和他们共进晚餐吗？你能和他们共进早餐吗？然后就问他们很多很多愚蠢的问题，他们会告诉你。他们会很乐意告诉你：“嘿，我是这样运作的。你知道，我是这样做的。其他人都是错的。”然后，你知道，他们会给你一套行动方案，你可以去比较。你可以去找下一个人说：“嘿，这是我从某人那里听到的行动方案。”他们会说：“不不，那完全错了。你不能那样做。我是这样做的。”然后，你知道，很快你就学到了足够多的东西。如果你，你知道，真的有毅力并且努力工作，你就能做成伟大的事情。这是关于你自己的。但同时，如果你能组建一个优秀的团队，因为作为领导者，你知道，你一个人做不了多少事。所以你能雇佣到最优秀的人吗？这也是其中的一部分。你知道什么是“优秀”吗？你面试过所有最优秀的人吗？然后你能说服他们，让最优秀的人来为你工作吗？一旦你开始组建一个由优秀人才组成的团队，他们就会提升你。这是我从本那里学到的一种管理杠杆，它来自安迪·格鲁夫（Andy Grove）的《高产出管理》（High Output Management）。但它基本上是说，他们是否优秀到让你能从他们身上学习？就像，你知道，阿里曾是一位出色的工程主管，但实际上他之所以出色，是因为在我手下工作的人都在做着了不起的事情，我只是站在他们的肩膀上。所以你只需要这样做，并且你必须递归地激励其他人也这样做，这样你最终就会拥有一支，你知道，令人惊叹的杀手级团队，而且你必须继续这样做。现在你必须，好吧，对于工程部门来说，这实际上并不难，因为我写了很多软件。但现在你是 CEO，所以你必须为市场营销部门、为销售部门做同样的事情，在这方面，你知道，他们非常有帮助，因为他们曾在 LoudCloud 和 Opsware 做过，所以他们知道如何构建一个 B2B 机器，知道游戏规则。但你必须再次这样做，但现在你是在一个你完全不了解的领域这样做，而且很可能你所有的直觉都是错误的，你的直觉完全错了。所以你能未卜先知地看到真相，还是想欺骗自己？我认为很多创始人都在这里犯了错误。他们会在自己的领域做得很好。当他们必须走出自己的领域时，他们就会犯错。他们会在其他角色中雇佣与自己领域类似的人，而这可能是致命的。所以，

Ben: By the way, that's how we started DataBricks was, I think, everybody was a PhD in computer science who was running anything.

Ben: 顺便说一句，我们 DataBricks 当初就是这样开始的，我想，所有负责任何事务的人都是计算机科学博士。

Ali: Yeah. Like including sales.

Ali: 是的。包括销售部门。

Ben: Yeah. Yeah, that's probably the number one mistake is you just go, "Okay, well, like I'm an engineer, so I want a sales guy who can talk to me and understands engineering." And that's like, "Well, that's not a really good criteria for sales." Like, one thing that I'm good at is rather than telling somebody, you know, that's stupid and hurting their feelings or so forth, I'll ask them a really messed-up question. You know, actually, I did it in a board meeting. I said, "Well, like, could you help me with the math on this?" 'Cause I don't understand the math.

Ben: 是的。是的，这可能就是头号错误，你只是说：“好吧，我是一名工程师，所以我想要一个能和我沟通、懂工程的销售人员。”而这就像是：“嗯，这并不是一个很好的销售标准。”比如，我擅长的一件事是，与其告诉别人，你知道，那是愚蠢的，并且伤害他们的感情等等，我宁愿问他们一个非常“刁钻”的问题。你知道，实际上，我在一次董事会议上就这么做了。我说：“嗯，你能帮我算算这个的数学问题吗？”因为我不懂这个数学。

Ali: Actually, it was worse. I said, "Help me with the—I'm just trying to understand basic math. You have all these numbers on the slide." Yeah.

Ali: 实际上，更糟。我说：“帮我算算——我只是想理解基本的数学。你的幻灯片上有很多数字。”是的。

Ben: And if you said that your conversion ratio is 5%. But I can't divide any of those two numbers to get 5%. And then the person freaked out and said, "No, no, don't freak out. Just tell me which of the two numbers do I divide to get 5%?" Because I've divided all of them and none of them is five.

Ben: 如果你说你的转化率是 5%。但我无法用那两个数字中的任何一个相除得到 5%。然后那个人就慌了，说：“不不，别慌。告诉我，我应该用哪两个数字相除才能得到 5%？”因为我把它们都除了一遍，没有一个结果是 5。

Ali: Like, "Am I going to be fired?" So he does a much better version of that, which is he'll like, if somebody's really, really screwed something up or messing, he'll go, "How do you think it's going?" And I was like, since he told me that, I was like, "Oh, yeah, that's a better way to do it. That's even better."

Ali: 就像是，“我会被解雇吗？”所以他做得更好，如果有人真的搞砸了什么或者出了问题，他会说：“你觉得进展如何？”自从他告诉我这个方法后，我就觉得：“哦，是的，这是一个更好的做法。这甚至更好。”

Ben: So, yeah. Yeah, he's a very good student.

Ben: 所以，是的。是的，他是个非常好的学生。

### 有效反馈与高强度文化

Ali: Can I rephrase that? So, like, you know, I think that's a—you know, there's this book called **Radical Candor** (彻底坦诚: 一种管理理念，提倡直接挑战但同时关心个人), and I think people take it too far and they misunderstand it and so on. But I think the essence of that book is that, if feedback—if, if, you know, are you criticizing me?

Ali: 我能重新措辞一下吗？我的意思是，你知道，有一本书叫《彻底坦诚》，我觉得人们把它理解得太过了，或者误解了等等。但我认为那本书的精髓是，如果反馈——如果你，你知道，你是在批评我吗？

a16z: Yeah.

a16z: 是的。

Ali: Are you saying I'm stupid? I can't do the vision because my point is not about the 5%. I was trying to make a different point, and now you're just—this is a cheap shot, and now I'm hurt and I think, by the way, I think you're wrong. It's not five, I said six and a half.

Ali: 你是说我笨吗？我无法实现愿景，因为我的重点不是那 5%。我试图表达一个不同的观点，而现在你只是——这是个卑鄙的攻击，我现在很受伤，顺便说一句，我认为你错了。不是 5%，我说的是 6.5%。

Ali: So, are you criticizing me, or is it like, "No, no, I'm here to help you. I can like, not help you, but if you beg me for help, maybe I'll help you." So, which of the two modes? So, if you can get people into the mode of like, "Oh, wow. I'm being helped. They're helping me and I'm going to get further ahead in my career and I'll be more successful." "Uh, please, no, no, no, please don't leave. Come back and tell me more like, 'Cause I'm taking notes here." So, if you can flip to that, and I think a lot of feedback can be recast into, you know, "I'm just here to help you, but feel free to completely ignore this advice. But, you know, if you want to be really successful, if you want to get that job or if you want to get that project next time, if you did it this way, that you probably would have had a higher probability of getting that, but you know, I don't care. Like, you do whatever you want." And then people are much more receptive. They're like, "No, no, no, please. I want to know more."

Ali: 那么，你是在批评我，还是说：“不不，我来这里是为了帮助你。我不是说要帮你，但如果你求我帮助，也许我会帮你。”那么，是这两种模式中的哪一种？所以，如果你能让人们进入这样的模式，比如：“哦，哇。我正在得到帮助。他们正在帮助我，我的职业生涯会更进一步，我会更成功。”“啊，拜托，不不不，请别走。回来告诉我更多，因为我正在做笔记。”所以，如果你能切换到这种模式，我认为很多反馈都可以重新包装成：“你知道，我只是来帮助你的，但你可以完全不理会这个建议。但是，你知道，如果你想真正成功，如果你想下次得到那份工作或那个项目，如果你这样做，你成功的可能性可能会更高，但你知道，我不在乎。你想怎么做就怎么做。”然后人们会更乐意接受。他们会说：“不不不，拜托。我想知道更多。”

a16z: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and then just the frequency of it, I think, helps a lot, too, where if I see you once a year at your review and I tell you what's wrong with you, you're going to be offended. No matter what it is, no matter how wrong it is, no matter how correct I am, it's going to be offensive. But if every day if I see you doing something I don't like, I go, "No, don't do it that way. Do it this way." Then you get desensitized to it. And so I think the mistake a lot of particular engineers make is they just don't say what they think when they think it because they're afraid of hurting someone's feelings. But that's how you save their feelings because they're used to you. You know, that's you're always doing that and you're doing with everybody. They see it. They're like, "Oh, yeah, Ben's an asshole. He's like always doing this, but like that's how he is and like that's how we work and it's no problem." As opposed to, you know, the the hammer and you try and put in a shit sandwich. Oh, you do this really well, but this is all messed up and this is good. And people are like, "Well, so like now in my written review, you're telling me that for the first time this is all messed up. Like, screw you." Yeah, this is very common and and you can see this in in the industry that, you know, people it's like

a16z: 是的。是的。是的。嗯，而且我认为，反馈的频率也有很大帮助。如果我一年只在你的绩效评估中见你一次，然后告诉你你有什么问题，你肯定会觉得被冒犯。无论是什么问题，无论有多错，无论我多么正确，都会让人觉得被冒犯。但如果我每天都看到你做了我不喜欢的事情，我就说：“不，不要那样做。这样做。”那么你就会对此麻木。所以我认为很多工程师犯的错误是，他们只是在想到的时候不说出自己的想法，因为他们害怕伤害别人的感情。但那样反而能保护他们的感情，因为他们已经习惯了你。你知道，你总是那样做，你对每个人都那样做。他们看到了，他们会想：“哦，是的，本就是个混蛋。他总是这样，但这就是他的为人，这就是我们的工作方式，没问题。”而不是，你知道，那种“大棒加胡萝卜”的方式。哦，你这方面做得很好，但这里全搞砸了，而那方面又很好。人们就会想：“嗯，所以在我的书面评估中，你第一次告诉我这一切都搞砸了。去你的。”是的，这在行业中非常普遍，你会看到，人们就像是——

Ben: You know, the extreme version of it is like they get fired, right?

Ben: 你知道，更极端的情况就是他们被解雇了，对吧？

a16z: And then head of HR talks to them and they're like, "Do you know, do you see this coming? It was obvious, right? You knew this." "No, I had no idea. Like, wait, you didn't get any feedback on this?" "Uh, no. Like, I only got thumbs up all along for like a whole year. So I'm in shock." This is super common, right?

a16z: 然后人力资源（HR）主管跟他们谈话，他们会说：“你知道吗？你有没有预料到会这样？这很明显，对吧？你早就知道了。”“不，我一点都不知道。等等，你没有收到这方面的任何反馈吗？”“呃，没有。我一整年都只收到赞扬。所以我很震惊。”这非常普遍，对吧？

### 扩大高强度文化：领导力与招聘策略

a16z: So maybe on the topic of managing talent, you have this incredibly high-intensity culture at DataBricks. And there was this thread recently in our CEO thread where they asked everyone, but you had a great response on, "Hey, we have 50 people. How do we scale? We have this culture of 996, right? You work 99 six days a week." How have you scaled that intensity well into 10,000 employees?

a16z: 那么，也许在人才管理这个话题上，DataBricks 有着令人难以置信的高强度文化。最近在我们的 CEO 讨论串中，他们问了所有人，但你有一个很棒的回答，关于“嘿，我们有 50 个人。我们如何扩展？我们有 996 的文化，对吧？你每周工作 6 天，每天 99 小时。”你是如何将这种强度成功扩展到 10,000 名员工的？

Ali: I think, uh, start with, you know, setting the tone at the top. If you're the hardest working person, you know, it kind of everything will take care of itself from there on. If you're not working hard, it's very hard. I mean, if you have, you know, it's a double standard. I mean, Ben has a whole book about that, which is, you know, "What You Do Is Who You Are" is the whole title of the book, right? So it's like if you are working extremely, extremely hard, the rest of the organization is also as well. You know, are you calling people at 9:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m.? Are you working weekends? Do they expect you, not that you expect them and you're going to be angry and yell at them if they're not dropping everything for you, not that, but the fact that they just know that Ali is working 24/7 and he's working 7 days a week and you know, he's working at 11 p.m. or 2 a.m. or whatever it is. I think that gets a lot of it done. The second thing I would say is, you can vet for this when you hire people.

Ali: 我认为，首先要从高层定下基调。如果你是工作最努力的人，那么一切都会水到渠成。如果你不努力工作，那就会非常困难。我的意思是，如果你有，你知道，这是一个双重标准。本有一整本书都在讲这个，书名就是《你所做即你所是》，对吧？所以，如果你工作极其努力，组织的其他人也会如此。你知道，你会在晚上 9 点、10 点给人们打电话吗？你会在周末工作吗？他们是否会期望你，而不是你期望他们，并且如果你不为他们放下一切，你就会生气并对他们大吼大叫，不是那样，而是他们只是知道阿里全天候工作，他每周工作 7 天，你知道，他会在晚上 11 点或凌晨 2 点工作，无论是什么时候。我认为这能完成很多事情。我想说的第二点是，你可以在招聘人才时进行筛选。

a16z: You know, and the easiest way to vet for it—

a16z: 你知道，最简单的筛选方法——

Ali: Because, you know,

Ali: 因为，你知道，

a16z: Well, it's you got to be careful with it because the people who say they're going to work the hardest are not the ones who work the hardest.

a16z: 嗯，你必须小心，因为那些说自己会最努力工作的人，往往并不是最努力工作的人。

Ali: So, don't, so don't—

Ali: 所以，不要，所以不要——

a16z: It's the opposite.

a16z: 恰恰相反。

Ali: Yeah. Yeah. 100% true, right? So, the best way to vet for this is to do backdoors. You know, ask people if if I ask someone, you know, "Hey, how was Sarah? Like, did you did you like was she great?" They're always going to say, "Yeah, she was great." Right.

Ali: 是的。是的。百分之百正确，对吧？所以，最好的筛选方法是进行侧面调查（backdoors）。你知道，问别人，如果我问一个人：“嘿，莎拉怎么样？你觉得她很棒吗？”他们总是会说：“是的，她很棒。”对吧。

Ben: But they're going to be much more honest if you ask them like, "Hey, how much does she like grind the midnight oil? Is she like—" and they'll tell you right away. It's like, "Oh my god, she works like crazy." It's like, "Um, you know, she's—I mean, I think she has a good balance." You know, you can like sus that out very easily from backdoors references. You can people will remember the people and they'll just offer it up and say, "Oh, that person was like nuts. They were like working 24/7." So, I think that way you can get people that are hardworking. By the way, I don't want to overemphasize. I don't think everything is just work harder. You know, you have to also work smarter. And I think that you want to make sure that it's sustainable. I can work insanely hard. I'm motivated. Everybody has a different threshold for how hard they can work. I don't think you want a culture where people are burning out. I think you really should avoid that. In fact, you know, at DataBricks, I'm very often going in and saying, "Hey, this team, like, you know, your scores are really bad on work-life balance. Like, what are you doing about it?" Or, "You guys should take several days off or you should do some offsites or do something." Like we actually go in and if we see that there's some groups and other groups at DataBricks, you know, their their work-life balance scores are like 100%. They're like, you know, slacking off. Um, you know, so then it's kind of the opposite. But, I do think that you can you can kind of vet for that. And I think that also setting the expectation. You know, I would say, you know, one of my competitors, Frank Slootman, wrote a book called "Amp It Up." It's a great book on how you get, you know, execution into a company, like getting a high-performance culture where everybody's always trying to excel and do better and better. Sort of that kind of culture into a company. That's that's a good book if you want to just study and he's doing it at scale at bigger companies. So I think that's highly recommended reading as well.

Ben: 但如果你问他们：“嘿，她有多喜欢熬夜工作？她是不是——”他们会更诚实地告诉你。他们会马上说：“哦天哪，她工作起来简直像疯了一样。”或者说：“嗯，你知道，她——我的意思是，我觉得她有一个很好的平衡。”你知道，你可以很容易地通过侧面调查（backdoors references）来了解这些。人们会记住那些人，他们会主动说：“哦，那个人简直疯了。他们就像是 24/7 全天候工作。”所以，我认为通过这种方式你可以找到勤奋的人。顺便说一句，我不想过分强调。我并不认为所有事情都只是更努力工作。你知道，你还必须更聪明地工作。而且我认为你需要确保它是可持续的。我可以疯狂地努力工作。我有动力。每个人对工作努力程度的承受能力都不同。我认为你不会想要一种让员工精疲力尽的文化。我认为你真的应该避免这种情况。事实上，你知道，在 DataBricks，我经常会进去说：“嘿，这个团队，你知道，你们在工作与生活平衡方面的分数很糟糕。你们打算怎么解决？”或者，“你们应该休几天假，或者搞一些团建活动，或者做些什么。”我们实际上会介入，如果我们发现 DataBricks 的某些团队，他们的工作与生活平衡分数是 100%。他们就像是，你知道，在偷懒。嗯，你知道，所以情况就有点相反了。但是，我确实认为你可以筛选出这类人。而且我认为，设定期望也很重要。你知道，我想说，我的一个竞争对手，弗兰克·斯洛特曼（Frank Slootman），写了一本书叫《加速》（Amp It Up）。这本书很好地讲述了如何让公司执行力强劲，如何建立一种高绩效文化，让每个人都不断追求卓越，做得越来越好。将这种文化融入公司。如果你想学习，那是一本好书，他正在更大的公司中大规模地实践。所以我也强烈推荐这本书。

### 组织设计与员工动力

a16z: Yeah. And I think, you know, a lot of it at his scale ends up being things like organizational design, and do are people feeling like they're having an impact when they're like it if people are feeling like they're having an impact and they're good then they'll work very hard. But if you're in some kind of weird three-legged race that the CEO has constructed where everybody's got dependencies on everybody else, it it just doesn't matter, you know, like you'll you'll just have a lot of people go like, "I know if I work hard, it's not going to make a difference. So, like, why would I do that?" And like you can't overcome that with rahrh and you know, lead by example or anything else like that's just fundamental to how it is. And you see in like look in any company of any scale, you know, even at our scale, like look, there are some groups who really can have impact and work extremely hard and then groups who have lesser impact will work less hard and you just see that.

a16z: 是的。而且我认为，在他那种规模的公司，很多事情最终都归结为组织设计，以及员工是否觉得他们正在产生影响。如果员工觉得他们正在产生影响并且表现良好，那么他们就会非常努力地工作。但如果你身处某种由 CEO 构建的奇怪的三足赛跑中，每个人都依赖于其他人，那根本就没有意义。你知道，很多人就会想：“我知道即使我努力工作，也无济于事。那么，我为什么要那样做？”而且你无法通过空泛的口号或以身作则来克服这一点，这只是其运作方式的基础。你会在任何规模的公司中看到这一点，你知道，即使在我们这个规模，你看，有些团队确实能产生影响并极其努力工作，而那些影响力较小的团队则会不那么努力工作，你就能看到这一点。

Ali: You know, people who are motivated and they feel excited about work and they don't see the impact that they're having, they're going to work way, way, way harder versus if you're demoralized and you feel like it's not going well, I'm not having impact, I don't have any autonomy, then, you know, you're not going to—you just don't want even you're like kind of depressed sitting down working. I do think there's one thing here where leaders can really help, which is to make your team feel like they're winning and that they're doing a great job. Like you can ask more from people, but if I feel like, "Hey, I'm losing and everything we're doing is wrong,"

Ali: 你知道，那些有动力、对工作感到兴奋，但看不到自己产生影响的人，他们会更加努力地工作；而如果你士气低落，觉得事情进展不顺利，我没有产生影响，我没有任何自主权，那么，你知道，你根本就不想，你甚至会感到沮丧地坐着工作。我确实认为，在这一点上，领导者可以真正提供帮助，那就是让你的团队觉得他们正在获胜，并且他们做得非常出色。你可以要求人们付出更多，但如果我觉得：“嘿，我正在输，我们所做的一切都是错的，”

a16z: And I'm putting in all these hours and it's stupid. Like, there's like, what's the point of this? Then people don't want to work. So you you so I think it's like feeling like we're winning, like we're the winning team. We're winning like, you know, and wow, they're expecting more from me. And you know, so then I think you can get you need that motivation in people.

a16z: 而且我投入了所有这些时间，这很愚蠢。就像，这有什么意义？那样人们就不想工作了。所以你，所以我认为这就像是感觉我们正在赢，我们是赢家团队。我们正在赢，你知道，而且哇，他们对我期望更高。然后，我认为你需要人们具备这种动力。

Ben: Yeah. Yeah. Which is why, by the way, the hard job is when you aren't winning.

Ben: 是的。是的。顺便说一句，这就是为什么，当你没有赢的时候，工作会很难。

a16z: Yeah. To get the output like particularly in Silicon Valley because, you know, you're battling attrition this and that and to get things on the right track, that that that that takes a whole different kind of level of technique and storytelling and

a16z: 是的。为了获得产出，尤其是在硅谷，因为，你知道，你正在与人员流失等问题作斗争，要把事情带回正轨，这需要完全不同层面的技术和讲故事的能力，以及——

Ben: Show you how you could be winning and all that kind of stuff that that gets very, very complicated.

Ben: 让你看到你如何能够获胜等等，那些事情会变得非常非常复杂。

a16z: We've both done that, right?

a16z: 我们都做过，对吧？

Ben: Yeah. There's been phases in our company's lives where

Ben: 是的。在我们公司的发展历程中，有过一些阶段，

a16z: We weren't winning.

a16z: 我们并没有赢。

Ali: Yeah. I mean, especially, you know, this the story you had in "Heart About Hard Things," which is probably the best business book I've read, which I read by the way before starting DataBricks and influenced us a lot. Those are super important. Yeah, that's that's the difficult, that's such an important point, because even if you're winning, people got to feel like that. But if you're not winning, getting them to feel like you're winning is, "We have a path to winning."

Ali: 是的。我的意思是，特别是，你知道，你在《艰难的真相》（Heart About Hard Things）中讲的那个故事，那可能是我读过的最好的商业书，顺便说一下，我在创办 DataBricks 之前就读过，对我们影响很大。那些非常重要。是的，那就是困难之处，那是一个如此重要的点，因为即使你正在赢，人们也必须有那种感觉。但如果你没有赢，让他们感觉你在赢，就是“我们有通往胜利的道路。”

a16z: Yeah, we have a path.

a16z: 是的，我们有一条道路。

Ali: We have a, you know, and it's like rock solid, it's going to work, but it demands sacrifice from all of us.

Ali: 我们有一个，你知道，它坚如磐石，会奏效，但这需要我们所有人做出牺牲。

Ben: And there is no feeling as good as when you're not winning and then you get it to winning.

Ben: 而且没有什么感觉比你没有赢，然后你把它变成赢家的感觉更好了。

Ali: Like that's the best feeling. You can't replicate that once you're super successful. You you never can quite get that feeling again.

Ali: 那是最好的感觉。一旦你非常成功，你就无法再复制那种感觉了。你再也无法完全获得那种感觉了。

a16z: Yeah, that's true.

a16z: 是的，没错。

Ben: But you also never feel that horrible pain again.

Ben: 但你也不会再感受到那种可怕的痛苦了。

Ali: Well, it's easier to be the underdog in some ways, right? You know, you have nothing to lose.

Ali: 嗯，在某些方面，作为弱者更容易，对吧？你知道，你没有什么可失去的。

Ben: In some ways. In most ways not.

Ben: 在某些方面。在大多数方面不是。

### 深入细节的领导风格

a16z: Well, I want to explore this leading from the top because that was kind of the first thing you started with. We actually hired an ex-DataBricks employee to A16Z. So, we have some inside scoop on your leadership style. And one of the things he said was, you have this, and Ben sort of touched on this too, but you have this amazing ability to be strategic, help your team focus, but you're also very in the weeds. Like, you're giving product feedback, you respond to emails super quickly, and product launch emails, no matter how small they are, you'll respond "congrats," which, you know, he found it hugely motivating. How do you do all that? Like, and where do you fly high, where do you fly low?

a16z: 嗯，我想探讨一下“从上而下的领导”这一点，因为那是你一开始就提到的。我们实际上聘请了一位前 DataBricks 员工到 A16Z。所以，我们对你的领导风格有一些内部消息。他说的其中一点是，你拥有这种——本也提到了这一点——但你拥有这种惊人的能力，既能制定战略，帮助团队聚焦，但你也非常深入细节。比如，你会提供产品反馈，回复邮件速度超快，而且产品发布邮件，无论多么小，你都会回复“恭喜”，这让他觉得非常有动力。你是如何做到这一切的？比如，你什么时候高瞻远瞩，什么时候又深入细节？

Ali: Yeah. By the way, I respond even to progress reports on all those products, and I follow them in detail, every one of them. I try to respond to every product.

Ali: 是的。顺便说一句，我甚至会回复所有这些产品的进度报告，并且详细跟踪每一个产品。我努力回复每一个产品。

a16z: Insane respond.

a16z: 疯狂地回复。

Ali: But, um, look, I think this is if you're just going to fly high and give high-level like inspirational speeches and then, you know, we'll trust and we'll delegate to people. It's not going to work. So my way is, you know, you got to get in the weeds. You got to understand this is back to what I said at the very beginning like, how do you become great at head of engineering? How do you hire a great head of marketing? The only way you can do that is by being really excellent at it. So you need to study the game and become the best. So, I try to stay, you know, stay tuned to all of these things.

Ali: 但是，嗯，你看，我认为如果你只是高高在上，发表一些鼓舞人心的演讲，然后说，我们会信任并授权给员工，那是行不通的。所以我的方式是，你必须深入细节。你必须理解这一点，这又回到了我一开始说的话：你如何才能成为一名出色的工程主管？你如何才能招聘到一名出色的营销主管？唯一的方法就是你必须真正擅长它。所以你需要研究这个游戏并成为最棒的。所以，我努力保持对所有这些事情的关注。

Ben: There's this quote, if you do everything, you will win.

Ben: 有句话说，如果你做所有的事情，你就会赢。

Ali: And then the question is, have you done everything?

Ali: 然后问题是，你是否做到了所有的事情？

Ben: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So, yeah, so, you know, you just—it takes a lot of effort. You know, you need to learn all your keyboard shortcuts. But I think that's, you know, people feel motivated that, "Hey, I have like direct relationship." You know, we used to say we used to have one of one of the culture principles used to be, "Hey, be a co-founder." And we don't want to have any employees at DataBricks, we just want co-founders. So, and the key point was like, "Hey, you're kind of the owner of this company. You're not just a renter. Come here and yeah, we can talk about it and you can you can suggest an idea. You might have just joined and you're straight out of school. You might have a great idea for a product. Tell me about it. You know, I'm I'm happy to push it." And so, it's it's making people feel like they they have an impact and they're inspired. Back to Ben's point, then it's going to be much more exciting for them, right, than following some bureaucracy. So, I I don't follow the bureaucracy basically. I go talk to anyone I like, you I try to go to the person that is actually the closest to the work that's being done at any given time.

Ben: 没错。没错。没错。所以，是的，你知道，这需要付出很多努力。你知道，你需要学习所有的键盘快捷键。但我认为这就是，你知道，人们感到有动力，因为“嘿，我好像有直接关系。”你知道，我们过去常说，我们的文化原则之一就是：“嘿，成为一名联合创始人。”我们不希望 DataBricks 有任何员工，我们只想要联合创始人。所以，关键点就是：“嘿，你有点像这家公司的老板。你不仅仅是一个租客。来这里，是的，我们可以谈谈，你可以提出一个想法。你可能刚加入，刚毕业。你可能有一个很棒的产品想法。告诉我吧。你知道，我很乐意推动它。”所以，这让人们觉得他们有影响力，他们受到启发。回到本的观点，那样对他们来说会比遵循一些官僚程序更令人兴奋，对吧？所以，我基本上不遵循官僚程序。我喜欢找谁就找谁谈，我努力去找那些在任何给定时间最接近正在进行的工作的人。

Ali: Uh, but there are some tricks and rules around how you do that without breaking the whole organization. So you can't just willingly talk to anyone. But yeah, that's that that's part of it.

Ali: 嗯，但关于如何做到这一点而不破坏整个组织，有一些技巧和规则。所以你不能随意与任何人交谈。但是的，那是其中的一部分。

Ben: Yeah, you listening and giving direction is is very different on that. If you give direction, you can cause a lot of chaos. But if you you go talk to people, you listen to understand the problem and then send it back down the chain of command, it tends to work very, very well. But look, generally, if you're a CEO and you don't fly low and fast, it's going to be a mess because you don't—you never get the truth because the truth never makes it to you like through your people. Like if you if I go talk to Ali's executive staff about what's going on in their organization or anybody's, first of all, they're gonna spin it. Second of all, they don't actually know. And so like you can't—you need to help them debug their organizations because they're they got a million things going on. They're also kind of going to the problem, going to the bottleneck, trying to figure out what's happening. And so like that it's just a very unreliable source of information. All the knowledge in a company is with the individual contributors that are doing the work and the customers that like—there's no there's no knowledge with the people who are talking to you as CEO who are on your staff. That's not that's not the way information moves. And so you got to be now he's like super fast. And which enables him to go super low. But you know in any given time, the way to think about it as a CEO is it's not like you're spending the exact amount of attention to HR as you are to, you know, the key engineering project as you are to the, you know, the key kind of sales competitive deals and that you you have to—you don't address everything evenly. You can never do that. It's just a bad idea. Now, you'll probably get to everything eventually, but you're not spending the same amount of time on every single department. The ORC chart is not the way that company works.

Ben: 是的，你的倾听和给出指示在这方面有很大不同。如果你给出指示，可能会造成很大的混乱。但如果你去和人们交谈，倾听以理解问题，然后将其反馈给指挥链，这样往往会运作得非常好。但你看，一般来说，如果你是 CEO，如果你不深入细节并快速行动，那就会一团糟，因为你永远得不到真相，因为真相永远不会通过你的人传达给你。比如，如果我去和阿里的高管团队谈论他们组织中发生的事情，或者任何人的组织，首先，他们会进行一番修饰。其次，他们实际上并不知道。所以你不能——你需要帮助他们调试他们的组织，因为他们有上百万的事情要处理。他们也正在处理问题，处理瓶颈，试图弄清楚发生了什么。所以，那只是一个非常不可靠的信息来源。公司所有的知识都掌握在那些正在工作的个人贡献者和客户手中——那些作为 CEO 跟你交谈的员工，他们身上没有知识。那不是信息流动的方式。所以你必须——现在他非常快。这使他能够深入到非常低的层面。但你知道，在任何时候，作为 CEO 的思考方式是，你不会对人力资源（HR）投入与关键工程项目完全相同程度的关注，也不会对关键销售竞争交易投入相同程度的关注，你必须——你不能平均地处理所有事情。你永远做不到。那只是一个糟糕的主意。现在，你最终可能会处理所有事情，但你不会在每个部门上花费相同的时间。组织结构图并不是公司运作的方式。

Ali: It's just a communication architecture.

Ali: 它只是一种沟通架构。

Ali: Yeah. I I think the best way I would say it is like it's kind of like a T and want to be broad and then you have the leg that goes down and goes really, really deep. But you want to do that anchoring. And the key thing is to have a really good priority order of what's most important and kind of drop everything else. Like, you know, you drop that T and go really, really low. Like it might be HR. I might be deep diving all the way down to HR, looking at our HR handbook, our policy, everything. Like, who was this person? What happened? Why is this happening in that group? What's going on in that group? What's the culture in that group? What happened here? Like, you might want to do that. It might be existential for your company, as we've seen some companies went under because of HR problems, right? Or ethical issues that were going on. So I think having a really good priority order is really important. I think some execs, like they just want to have a perfect ducks in a row. "I have my weekly one-on-ones, I have my weekly staff meeting, I have my weekly this," and then, "I do this," and then, "We follow the rules," and "We do all of this." And then that's like just like the top part of the T.

Ali: 是的。我想最好的说法是，它有点像一个“T”字形，你希望广度很大，然后你有一条腿向下，深入到非常非常深的地方。但你想做的是那种锚定。关键是要有一个非常好的优先级顺序，知道什么是最重要的，然后放下其他一切。就像，你知道，你放下那个“T”字形的横杠，深入到非常非常低的层次。比如可能是人力资源（HR）。我可能会深入到 HR 的所有细节，查看我们的 HR 手册、政策、所有一切。比如，这个人是谁？发生了什么？为什么在这个团队发生这种事？那个团队发生了什么？那个团队的文化是什么？这里发生了什么？你可能会想这样做。这可能对你的公司来说是生死攸关的，正如我们看到一些公司因为 HR 问题而倒闭，对吧？或者正在发生的道德问题。所以我认为有一个非常好的优先级顺序非常重要。我认为一些高管，他们只是想把所有事情都安排得井井有条。“我每周进行一对一会谈，我每周开员工会议，我每周做这个，”然后，“我做那个，”然后，“我们遵循规则，”然后“我们做所有这些。”然后那就像是“T”字形的顶部。

Ben: And then there's nothing that goes deep, and that's the issue, I think.

Ben: 然后就没有深入的东西了，我认为这就是问题所在。

a16z: Yeah. Over systematizing or making it like symmetrical. You don't even—you don't have to have one-on-ones with the same frequency of all your staff or like some of them you you know like you can meet very seldom. Well, like everything is different. Every part of the company is different. You may need to meet with somebody every day.

a16z: 是的。过度系统化或者让它变得对称。你甚至不用——你不用和所有员工以相同的频率进行一对一会谈，或者其中一些你很少会面。嗯，一切都不同。公司的每个部分都不同。你可能需要每天和某人会面。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

a16z: And then other people, you know, you can meet once a quarter for now because it's just not that serious. And you can't get caught up in making everything fair and symmetric. Particularly like your staff, they got to be able to deal.

a16z: 然后其他人，你知道，现在你可以每季度见一次，因为它没那么重要。你不能纠结于让所有事情都公平和对称。特别是你的员工，他们必须能够应对。

Ben: Yeah. And this is actually the biggest conversation that I had with Ali early on is like, "If they can't do it, they can't do it."

Ben: 是的。这实际上是我早期和阿里最重要的一次谈话，就是：“如果他们做不到，那就是做不到。”

Ali: That's it.

Ali: 就这样。

Ben: It's a wrap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't try and fix them. They can't be fixed. It's not going to happen.

Ben: 结束了。是的。是的。是的。别想去修补他们。他们是修补不了的。那不会发生。

Ali: And you know, it's a sad lesson, but important lesson.

Ali: 而且你知道，这是一个悲伤但重要的教训。

### 微软合作：从困境到转机

a16z: I actually I want to turn the conversation to an area that Ben was saying you had to catch up on at least in the beginning, which is the BD deal-making stuff, which is interesting to me just because I think of you as like a consummate dealmaker now. I feel like you're playing chess, everyone else is playing checkers. I want to go back to 2017 with maybe one of the first game-changing deals that you guys did, and that was the deal with Microsoft. Can you guys talk a little bit more about how that deal came about? Anything you do differently? And by the way, founders still to this day ask us about it because it's sort of a model for how they'd like to do deals.

a16z: 我实际上想把话题转向本说你至少在初期需要迎头赶上的一个领域，那就是业务拓展（BD）的交易促成方面，这对我来说很有趣，因为我现在觉得你是一个完美的交易促成者。我感觉你在下国际象棋，而其他人都在下跳棋。我想回到 2017 年，谈谈你们做的第一个改变格局的交易之一，那就是与微软的交易。你们能多谈谈那笔交易是如何达成的吗？有没有什么不同的做法？顺便说一句，直到今天，创始人仍然向我们询问这笔交易，因为它有点像是他们希望如何达成交易的典范。

Ali: Yeah, maybe maybe I should start by saying that, you know, we had tried to get close to Microsoft for a long while. I think Ben had told us, "You need to—that's an important partner—because they have the biggest distribution channel." You know, they today they have 60,000 sellers. "If you can unlock that in any small way, it's going to be a game changer for you." And I had been trying, and I had been CEO for a year. So, I'd been trying hard to get in there. And many, many people offered me, you know, "Hey, so here's—I actually know Satya, so I'm going to get you introduced." And I got multiple introductions to Satya. He just like either never responded or just CCed his EA, and it went into EA, you know, like, "We're still trying to find time. He's been so busy this last six months, you know." So, but then, then he had a meeting with Ben, and I think he was here actually at A16Z. And, and they actually just talked, and I was not actually in the loop. And then he called me up and said, "Hey, I talked to Satya, and I think this is—he's excited. He wants to do this."

Ali: 是的，也许我应该先说，我们很长一段时间以来都试图与微软建立密切关系。我想本曾告诉我们：“你需要——那是一个重要的合作伙伴——因为他们拥有最大的分销渠道。”你知道，他们今天有 60,000 名销售人员。“如果你能以任何小方式解锁这一点，那对你来说将是游戏规则的改变。”我一直在努力，我担任 CEO 已经一年了。所以，我一直在努力争取进入。很多人都向我提供了帮助，你知道，“嘿，我其实认识萨蒂亚（Satya），所以我会帮你引荐。”我获得了多次与萨蒂亚的引荐。他要么从未回应，要么只是抄送了他的行政助理（EA），然后就进了 EA 的邮箱，你知道，就像是：“我们还在努力找时间。他过去六个月一直很忙，你知道。”所以，但后来，他与本开了一个会，我想他当时实际上就在 A16Z。而且，他们实际上只是谈了谈，我当时并不在其中。然后他打电话给我说：“嘿，我跟萨蒂亚谈过了，我觉得他很兴奋。他想做这件事。”

Ben: And I I saved the email. So Ben introduced me to Satya, and this was I think 3 or 4 AM. I was like in New York, and the email went to Satya, and then Satya added like four or five people to the email thread, and then they added four or five people. So like within an hour, I had like 25 emails in my inbox. And suddenly all these people that were not responding to my emails from Microsoft, right after Satya CCed the next person, they were all like, "Hey, I'm clearing my calendar. Would love to meet you. Do you have any time in the next two days or three days?" Or, you know, but really kind of the original pitch of what's the give and get was Ben and Satya at A16Z, and they kind of figured it out, and I was not actually even there. So we had some luck, and then Ali did a couple of things that were, or quite a few things that that that were very, very effective. So the luck was, at the time, deal with big companies, there's always a timing element. And there was a company called Hortonworks that had a deal with Microsoft to provide some similar kind of functionality, and they were basically putting a gun to Microsoft's head saying like, "You pay us more money, or we're going to pull our product."

Ben: 我保存了那封邮件。本把我介绍给萨蒂亚，那时我想是凌晨三四点。我在纽约，邮件发给了萨蒂亚，然后萨蒂亚又把四五个人加进了邮件串，接着他们又加了四五个人。所以在一个小时内，我的收件箱里就有大约 25 封邮件。突然间，所有那些之前不回复我邮件的微软员工，在萨蒂亚抄送了下一个人之后，他们都说：“嘿，我把日程清出来了。很乐意与你见面。你未来两三天有时间吗？”或者，你知道，但最初关于“付出与回报”的提议实际上是本和萨蒂亚在 A16Z 达成的，他们基本上搞定了，我当时甚至都不在场。所以我们有一些运气，然后阿里做了一些非常非常有效的事情，或者说很多事情。所以运气在于，当时与大公司打交道，总是有时间因素。当时有一家公司叫 Hortonworks，他们与微软有协议，提供一些类似的功能，他们基本上是在威胁微软，说：“你要么给我们更多钱，要么我们就撤回产品。”

Ali: And they were on-prem and they were in cloud, so it was like a big mismatch also.

Ali: 他们既有本地部署（on-prem），也有云端服务，所以也存在很大的不匹配。

Ben: Yeah. So it was a real—so Microsoft was like super pissed at them and wanted to stick it to them. And so that was, you know, so you have Satya going like, "I think this company's interesting." And then this ground-level thing going like, "We want to screw these guys." And that that kind of opened enough of a door to get it going. But there were so like one of the most important things in the deal was, which you know, and John O'Farrell really emphasized this for for both of us was, "Look, you got to get them to put enough—they're such a big company that they're going to lose interest many times. So, if you don't have them write you such a big check that somebody in there is going to get fired if it doesn't go well, you're it doesn't matter if you get the deal, you're going to lose the deal." And so, what we did is we're like, and the technique that we had was, "Okay, give us a forecast. Like, like we we're a little company. We can't afford to do this deal, you know? We can only afford to have one partner. So, give us a forecast of what you'll do."

Ben: 是的。所以这确实——微软当时对他们非常恼火，想给他们一个教训。所以，你知道，萨蒂亚觉得：“我觉得这家公司很有趣。”然后基层的人也觉得：“我们想把这些人搞垮。”这种情势就打开了足够的门，让事情得以启动。但其中一个最重要的交易要素是，约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）对我们两人都强调了这一点：“听着，你必须让他们投入足够的资金——他们是如此大的公司，他们会多次失去兴趣。所以，如果你不让他们开出一张足够大的支票，以至于如果事情进展不顺利，他们内部有人会被解雇，那么即使你达成了交易，你也会失去这笔交易。”所以，我们采取的策略是：“好吧，给我们一个预测。我们是一家小公司。我们承担不起这笔交易，你知道吗？我们只能有一个合作伙伴。所以，给我们一个你们会怎么做的预测。”

Ali: Yeah. 'Cause our engineers are busy. Like, they're going to do this integration that wipes out 12 months of our roadmap. We don't we don't have anything else. You guys have like many thousands of engineers. So this is we only have one of these we can.

Ali: 是的。因为我们的工程师很忙。他们将进行这项集成，这将耗费我们 12 个月的路线图。我们没有其他东西了。你们有成千上万的工程师。所以我们只有这一次机会。

Ben: Yeah. So we, you know, whoever can sell the—we think you can sell the most, but we don't know like what's your—so, you know, like kind of challenged their kind of manhood a little bit. And so they come out with this big-ass forecast, and we're like, "Okay, great. Just give us a little portion of that."

Ben: 是的。所以我们，你知道，谁能卖出最多的——我们认为你能卖出最多的，但我们不知道你的——所以，你知道，有点挑战了他们的“男子气概”。然后他们就拿出了这个巨大的预测，我们说：“好的，太棒了。给我们一点点就行。”

Ali: It was a huge deal. It was a lot of it.

Ali: 那是一笔巨大的交易。其中很多。

Ben: Yeah. Yeah. And then then then Ali said, "Look, you know, when we got all the way down to the deal, he was like, 'If I don't get this number, Ben's going to fire me.'"

Ben: 是的。是的。然后阿里说：“你看，当我们谈到这笔交易时，他说，‘如果我拿不到这个数字，本会解雇我。’”

Ali: And so, can you help me out?

Ali: 所以，你能帮我一下吗？

Ben: It was very interesting. Bad cop.

Ben: 这很有趣。坏警察。

Ali: It was a very interesting dynamic. So, you know, John O'Farrell had strategized with us and told us that, you know, they have to do a big pre-commit because then they have skin in the game, otherwise they're just going to forget. They'll do like the PR, but then they'll forget about you. But then when we were trying to get that from Microsoft, I remember I was talking to Takeshi Matsumoto, who is, you know, one of the main brains at Microsoft, like one of the key strategists there.

Ali: 那是一种非常有趣的动态。你知道，约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）曾与我们一起制定策略，并告诉我们，他们必须做出一个大的预先承诺，因为这样他们才有风险，否则他们就会忘记。他们会做公关，然后就会把你忘了。但当我们试图从微软那里得到这个承诺时，我记得我当时在和松本武（Takeshi Matsumoto）谈话，他你知道，是微软的主要智囊之一，那里的关键战略家之一。

Ali: And his thing was, "I don't want to give you a big commit 'cause you're such a small company. I'm worried you take this money and you get drunk off of it and you're not going to do anything afterwards."

Ali: 他的意思是：“我不想给你一个大承诺，因为你们是如此小的公司。我担心你拿了这笔钱后会得意忘形，然后什么都不做。”

Ali: And so I had to really convince him that, "No, I'm extremely hungry. Like there's no way. I will continue to have crazy appetites. Don't worry about it." So both sides were kind of worried about different things. But but yeah, the give and get was important that you said in the beginning, which was they had a gap in the product portfolio.

Ali: 所以我必须真正说服他：“不，我非常渴望成功。不可能的。我将继续保持疯狂的胃口。别担心。”所以双方都担心不同的事情。但，是的，你一开始说的“付出与回报”很重要，那就是他们的产品组合存在一个空白。

Ben: Right? They were competing with AWS. They had a gap at the time, and we had a great product. They have amazing distribution channel. So like in in these BD deals, there always has to be a give and get that actually is kind of commensurate. And this is why most of these deals fall apart and they don't work.

Ben: 对吧？他们当时在和 AWS 竞争。他们当时有一个空白，而我们有一个很棒的产品。他们有惊人的分销渠道。所以在这些业务拓展（BD）交易中，总是需要有一个实际相称的付出与回报。这就是为什么大多数这些交易都破裂并失败的原因。

Ali: There has to be something that you as a small player can give that they don't have. And usually you don't have anything to give them. Usually I find all these small companies show up and they come for instance to DataBricks now and say, "Oh, we'd love for you to partner with us." But what what am I getting out of it, right? You don't report to me, I don't report to you. So the moment we've closed the deal, if it's not good for me, neither of us will just do our side of the bargain. So there has to be something in the deal dynamics, in the construct that inherently is extremely beneficial both sides. There has to be a trade that makes sense. Microsoft really wanted that product. We really wanted their distribution channel.

Ali: 作为小公司，你必须能提供一些他们没有的东西。通常你没有什么可以给他们的。我通常发现所有这些小公司出现，比如现在来找 DataBricks，说：“哦，我们很乐意与你们合作。”但我也能从中得到什么呢，对吧？你不向我汇报，我也不向你汇报。所以一旦我们达成交易，如果对我没有好处，我们双方都不会履行各自的承诺。因此，在交易动态和结构中，必须有一些内在的、对双方都极其有利的东西。必须有一个有意义的交易。微软确实想要那个产品。我们确实想要他们的分销渠道。

### 谈判中的坚韧与微软的转型

Ben: And then the other thing that I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't understand is any big deal of that size, you lose at least three times before you win it. And we lost that deal

Ben: 然后，我认为很多企业家不理解的另一件事是，任何那种规模的大交易，在你赢之前至少会输三次。而我们输了那笔交易——

Ali: 10 times.

Ali: 10 次。

Ben: 10 times. And like including like the day before we were supposed to launch it. The you know the the antibodies came out of the company and Ali had to fly up to Redmond and sit there.

Ben: 10 次。包括在我们原定发布的前一天。公司的“抗体”出现了，阿里不得不飞到雷德蒙德（Redmond）坐镇。

Ali: There was one engineer that just said, "Not doing this. This is not going to go. We don't." He just he was they actually put a guy in place at Microsoft who was actually super you had a great reputation but he was a builder. So he just had huge problems with this. It's like, "This is not a product I built. Why would we why would I make this successful?" So, yeah, there's like usually there's like many times so like if if you don't have grit, those deals will die because this deal died multiple times as Ben said. It was like completely over, like it was completely blocked by some exec that said, "Absolutely not. I'm blocking it. It's veto. It's over." And no one wanted to overrule him. So you have to go in there and work. You have to and the only way we did, I like they call it the nerd bird. I would take the, you know, SF Seattle flight up there. I was up there so much. I knew all the buildings, all the rooms, everything. So you just have to spend time on the ground and talk to as many people as possible and sort of influence that organization from within. And I will say look, you know, with with all the difficulty of the deal and, and Microsoft being Microsoft, they've been as good a partner as not only we've had at DataBricks, but in the entire portfolio. I mean, they've really, you know, lived up and delivered what they said they would do, which is I I think you have to give such a a huge credit because like in the whole Gates and Ballmer era, they were never that good a partner to anybody. And he's really turned that around and, you know, they they've been fantastic with us. This was around the time where Satya had taken over and, you know, he was giving to everyone at Microsoft the book "Growth Mindset" or "Mindset," which is about growth mindset. So there was this kind of aura in the air that, you know, we should we should try like, "Let's try to make things happen. Let's have a growth mindset here. Let's see is there a way we can partner." So this would have been impossible five years earlier. So is kudos to Satya and they put us on the map, and he's been a great partner ever since. You know, whenever there's been issues, they always resolve it. So, you know, we are very thankful. We wouldn't be where we are without them.

Ali: 有一位工程师就是说：“我不干了。这行不通。我们不做。”他就是——他们实际上在微软安排了一个人，这个人声誉非常好，但他是一个建设者。所以他对此有很大的问题。他会说：“这不是我开发的产品。我们为什么要，我为什么要让它成功？”所以，是的，通常有很多次，所以如果你没有毅力，那些交易就会夭折，因为这笔交易就像本说的那样，多次夭折。它完全结束了，就像被某个高管完全阻止了，他说：“绝对不行。我阻止它。这是否决。结束了。”没有人愿意推翻他。所以你必须去那里工作。你必须——我们唯一的方法，我喜欢他们称之为“书呆子鸟”。我会乘坐旧金山到西雅图的航班。我去了很多次。我认识所有的建筑、所有的房间、所有的一切。所以你必须花时间在当地，与尽可能多的人交谈，并从内部影响那个组织。我不得不说，你看，尽管这笔交易困难重重，而且微软就是微软，他们不仅是 DataBricks 合作过的最好的伙伴，也是我们整个投资组合中最好的。我的意思是，他们真的，你知道，兑现并交付了他们所说的，我认为你必须给予极大的赞扬，因为在盖茨和鲍尔默的时代，他们从未对任何人如此好的合作伙伴。而他真的扭转了局面，你知道，他们对我们非常棒。这大约是萨蒂亚（Satya）接任的时候，他当时正在给微软的每个人推荐《成长型思维》（Growth Mindset）或《心态》（Mindset）这本书，这本书讲的是成长型思维。所以当时空气中弥漫着一种氛围，你知道，我们应该尝试，“让我们努力促成事情发生。让我们在这里拥有成长型思维。看看我们是否有合作的方式。”所以这在五年前是不可能发生的。所以要归功于萨蒂亚，他们让我们声名鹊起，从那以后他一直是一个很棒的合作伙伴。你知道，每当有问题时，他们总是会解决。所以，你知道，我们非常感激。没有他们，我们不会有今天的成就。

### 并购策略：人、产品与财务

a16z: Yeah. No just amazing, amazing really. I I want to open up the conversation to deal more more broadly. Now that you're not a small company anymore and you're a big company making acquisitions, you know, Tabular, Neon, Mosaic, just to name a few. What is your sort of your your approach in terms of when to to to build versus when to buy slash how do you think about sort of acquisitions more broadly?

a16z: 是的。不，真是太棒了，真的。我想现在更广泛地谈谈交易。既然你们不再是小公司，而是一家进行收购的大公司，比如 Tabular、Neon、Mosaic，仅举几例。你们在“自建”与“收购”之间，或者说更广泛地来说，你们是如何考虑收购的？

Ali: Yeah, I mean, what we try to not do, so let's start with a simple thing, is a lot of companies, especially at scale, they'll buy revenue. So they'll look at a company, they say, "Hey, this company is this size. We'll just buy that company. We'll put more sales people on it. Then we can accelerate the revenue. We're buying that revenue." And that's how they're doing it. We're not doing that. You know, what we're really doing is number one, we spend a lot of time with the team and the founders. So we're trying to see, "Hey, can we build together? Like, you come here and you build together." That's very different from that buying revenue model. The buying revenue model often times, you part ways from the C with the CEO from day one. Like, you can see the big companies, they literally have a plan. Like, I have, you know, have some execs that come from these big companies. They say, "Hey, our plan usually is to part ways with the CEO. Like, you make a deal, and the CEO can leave." And then, but also the key people in those companies quickly leave, all of them, like the top management, and then, you know, you keep promoting the people from below that couldn't get promoted before, and then eventually you bring in your own people to take over the company, and then the company is dead. There's nothing left of it, and there's no integration between that asset that you bought and the platform that you have. So to avoid all of those, can you get people that really feel like they're your co-founders? So, we spent just enormous amount of time with who we're like the—the company you're buying, who are the founders, how do they work, are we culturally the same? Spend time with them. Do we get along? Do we see the world the same way? You know, are we going to click? Are we going to do this together? Are we going to be able to build in the next five years? So, that's where we spend number one. Number two, we spend a lot of time on the product. You know, what's the product experience? How would we integrate this? What would it look like? How much can we can we rewrite most of it? Can we not rewrite it? What's the what programming? Like I always ask this, and people like, "Why? That's such a dumb question. I ask what what language would you write it in? Like why do you want to do that? What is what does that matter?" "No, because we're going to integrate the code bases, right? It's like the build systems won't work. It's not going to even compile." So, so a product is something we spend a huge amount of time and talking to customers, understanding what the um what the what the excitement around that product looks like and how the integration would look like. The last thing we do is we look at the financials, you know, what's the revenue multiple and, you know, how much can we grow it and what's the three-year plan, five-year plan and so on. And I feel like big companies' corporate departments do it exactly in the reverse order of this. They start with, "Hey, the revenue is this, but we could accelerate it and the multiple is so low and like, you know, in this in my Excel sheet here, this makes perfect sense." And then second, they go to like, "Hey, is this a good product?" And then lastly, like, "Hey, how do we convince these knuckleheads? I mean, we probably don't want to have them here, but we got to pay them off somehow." So, I think, you know, thinking about it that way, you get more longevity out of it.

Ali: 是的，我的意思是，我们尽量不做的事情，让我们从一个简单的事情开始，就是很多公司，尤其是在规模化之后，他们会购买营收。所以他们会看一家公司，说：“嘿，这家公司有这么大。我们直接收购这家公司。我们会在上面投入更多的销售人员。然后我们就能加速营收。我们正在购买这份营收。”他们就是这样做的。我们不这样做。你知道，我们真正做的是，第一，我们花大量时间与团队和创始人在一起。所以我们试图看看：“嘿，我们能一起建设吗？比如，你来这里，我们一起建设。”这与那种购买营收的模式非常不同。购买营收的模式通常从第一天起，你就会与 CEO 分道扬镳。比如，你可以看到那些大公司，他们真的有计划。比如，我有一些来自这些大公司的高管。他们说：“嘿，我们通常的计划是与 CEO 分道扬镳。比如，你达成交易，CEO 就可以离开。”然后，这些公司的关键人物也会很快离开，所有人都走，比如高层管理人员，然后，你知道，你不断提拔那些以前无法获得晋升的下层员工，然后最终你引入自己的人来接管公司，然后公司就死了。什么都不剩了，你收购的资产和你拥有的平台之间没有任何整合。所以为了避免所有这些，你能找到那些真正觉得自己是你的联合创始人的人吗？所以，我们花了很多很多时间去了解我们要收购的公司，创始人是谁，他们如何工作，我们的文化是否一致？花时间与他们在一起。我们相处得好吗？我们看待世界的方式一样吗？你知道，我们能合拍吗？我们会一起做这件事吗？我们能在未来五年内建设成功吗？所以，这是我们投入第一位的地方。第二，我们花很多时间在产品上。你知道，产品体验是什么？我们如何整合它？它会是什么样子？我们能重写多少？我们不能重写吗？编程语言是什么？我总是问这个问题，人们会说：“为什么？那真是个愚蠢的问题。我问你会用什么语言编写它？你为什么要那样做？那有什么关系？”“不，因为我们要整合代码库，对吧？就像构建系统会不兼容。它甚至无法编译。”所以，产品是我们投入大量时间去研究，并与客户交流，了解客户对该产品的热情是什么样子，以及整合会是什么样子。我们做的最后一件事是看财务状况，你知道，营收倍数是多少，以及我们能增长多少，三年计划、五年计划等等。我觉得大公司的企业部门做的顺序正好相反。他们从“嘿，营收是这么多，但我们可以加速它，而且倍数很低，你知道，在我这里的 Excel 表格里，这完全说得通。”然后第二，他们会问：“嘿，这是个好产品吗？”最后，他们会说：“嘿，我们怎么说服这些笨蛋？我的意思是，我们可能不希望他们在这里，但我们总得想办法把他们打发走。”所以，我认为，你知道，那样思考问题，你会获得更长的生命力。

Ben: Yeah. And this is this really comes it sounds like he's talking like a product guy, but this is really the thing that people get wrong on the go-to-market because what happens is if you've got multiple product architectures, that's going to mean multiple SE forces, multiple post-sales things, and your entire sales efficiency is going to go through the floor. And because, you know, they have a keen eye on that, everything they buy ends up looking like a DataBricks product, you know, like and and that work is going in. They're not just selling some crap to get some money to, you know, go on a corp dev thing. And I would say so many like when you bring in a professional CEO, this is what they screw up because they don't understand that. Yeah. Engineering goes, "Yeah, yeah, we can take it on. There's another set of engineers. We don't care if they work on that." Blah, blah, blah. And engineering gets less efficient too, but it wrecks the field, and that's, and then the customers hate it because it, yeah. Like, "Okay, I've got to learn another access control model. I got to do this. I got, you know, these are not things anybody wants to be part of."

Ben: 是的。这真的——听起来他像是在谈产品，但这确实是人们在市场进入策略（go-to-market）上犯错的地方，因为如果你的产品架构有多个，那将意味着多支销售工程师（SE）团队，多个售后服务环节，你的整体销售效率将一落千丈。而且因为，你知道，他们对此非常关注，所以他们收购的所有东西最终都看起来像 DataBricks 的产品，你知道，而且这些工作都在进行中。他们不仅仅是为了通过公司发展（corp dev）赚点钱而卖一些垃圾。我想说，很多时候，当你引入一位专业的 CEO 时，他们会搞砸这一点，因为他们不理解。是的。工程部门会说：“是啊，是啊，我们可以承担。还有另一批工程师。他们做那个我们不在乎。”等等等等。工程效率也会降低，但这会毁了市场，然后客户会讨厌它，因为它，是的。就像：“好吧，我得学习另一种访问控制模型。我得做这个。我得，你知道，这些都不是任何人想参与的事情。”

Ali: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. This is it's the go-to-market side that you're worried about that, you know, that experience that those customers will have. You know, they're going to come back immediately and say, "Hey, we were so we were already upset about these things before the acquisition. Maybe you can fix them now." It's like, "No, actually, you know, several of those people actually quit, and now we're going to just work on integration, and that thing now got pushed out another two years." Yeah.

Ali: 是的，百分之百正确。是的。你担心的是市场进入策略（go-to-market）方面，你知道，是那些客户会有的体验。你知道，他们会立刻回来抱怨：“嘿，在收购之前，我们已经对这些事情很不满了。也许你现在能解决它们？”结果却是：“不，实际上，你知道，其中几个人已经辞职了，现在我们只专注于整合，那件事又被推迟了两年。”是的。

Ben: Um, so you don't want to be in that situation. So there's a lot of companies that do that, and by the way, it work what they're doing works revenue-wise. They are getting the revenue, they are getting the the stock swap works. Like, you know, if they're multiple of the—

Ben: 嗯，所以你不想陷入那种境地。有很多公司都这样做，顺便说一句，他们正在做的事情在营收方面是有效的。他们确实获得了营收，他们确实进行了股票互换。比如，你知道，如果他们是多个——

a16z: It's a creative deal temporarily.

a16z: 暂时而言，这是一笔有创意的交易。

Ben: Yeah, it works, and then the first year you get the bump in the revenue. You get a second year boost in revenue growth as well. So fin the financial engineering actually works great for those companies. It's just long term. It ends up being like, you know, a bag of crap that doesn't work together.

Ben: 是的，它奏效了，然后第一年你的营收就有了增长。第二年营收增长也会得到提升。所以金融工程对这些公司来说实际上非常有效。只是从长远来看。它最终会变成一堆无法协同工作的垃圾。

Ali: And it affects a brand. You know, like one of the things is, one of the reasons DataBricks is so powerful is all their customers want to buy all their products because they're like, "We know that's the best software we buy." And as soon as you start chipping away at that with these financial strategies, like you can't get it back because the reputation is every customer's experience. There is there's no marketing through that.

Ali: 而且它会影响品牌。你知道，其中一件事是，DataBricks 如此强大的原因之一是，他们的所有客户都想购买他们所有的产品，因为他们会说：“我们知道那是我们能买到的最好的软件。”一旦你开始用这些财务策略来侵蚀它，你就无法挽回，因为声誉就是每个客户的体验。没有通过那种方式进行的营销。

Ben: It's the best software because it was written by the engineers and built by those that were the best. Yeah.

Ben: 它是最好的软件，因为它是最好的工程师编写和构建的。是的。

Ali: Including the acquisitions that we got. They were phenomenal people that came in and they continue, and since we gelled, they continued building it.

Ali: 包括我们收购的公司。他们都是非常优秀的人才，加入后继续发展，而且由于我们磨合得很好，他们也持续在构建。

Ben: So that's why it's great. It's like the, you know, so we pay a lot of attention. That's like back to the, you know, who are you getting into your company?

Ben: 所以这就是它很棒的原因。就像，你知道，我们非常重视。这又回到了，你知道，你让谁进入你的公司？

Ali: Yeah. Yeah. That's the other thing, right? Like you can buy something that's got a lot of sales where you're downgrading your whole like company. Ross Perot actually wrote about in "Citizen Perot" his biggest fear, which definitely came true, was he built this elite thing at EDS, and then they would actually acquire IT departments, and they're like he was like, "They're going to absorb us, not vice versa," and that does happen.

Ali: 是的。是的。这是另一回事，对吧？就像你可以收购一个有很多销售额的公司，结果却降低了你整个公司的水准。罗斯·佩罗（Ross Perot）在《佩罗公民》（Citizen Perot）中写到了他最大的恐惧，这确实发生了，他在 **EDS** (电子数据系统: 曾经是信息技术服务领域的巨头) 建立了一个精英团队，然后他们会实际收购 IT 部门，他当时想，“他们会吸收我们，而不是反过来”，这种情况确实会发生。

Ben: Yeah, there there is one really good company that we never acquired, and I always vetoed it whenever it came up because I just think that the quality of their employee base is not great, and I didn't want it to dilute DataBricks. You know, otherwise from every other angle, that deal always made sense, and I always vetoed it because I felt that, you know, it's just they're all going to quit or be super unhappy. Let's just not do it. Yeah. It's also why like merger of equals are because

Ben: 是的，有一家非常好的公司我们从未收购，我每次提到它都会否决，因为我只是觉得他们员工的素质不太好，我不想稀释 DataBricks。你知道，否则从其他所有角度来看，那笔交易总是很有意义的，但我总是否决它，因为我觉得，你知道，他们都会辞职或者非常不开心。我们还是别做了。是的。这也是为什么“对等合并”会发生，因为——

a16z: Yeah,

a16z: 是的，

Ben: Because the cultures aren't equal. The people aren't equal.

Ben: 因为文化不平等。人不平等。

a16z: And what made you feel that way? You just spent time with them and you they just didn't exude sort of DataBricks culture.

a16z: 是什么让你有那种感觉？你只是和他们待在一起，他们就没有散发出 DataBricks 的那种文化吗？

Ali: Well, I mean, it's look, it's it's like with everything else. Like, it's like when we were grading students at the university, it's like, okay, the rock stars are super easy to find out. So they're like there, and then the people that are really, really bad, that's like it's not hard. And then there are people in the middle that's it's it's that's in the gray zone. This was a company that was, you know, I feel like the talent is not phenomenal, and you don't need to be a genius to know that. And then there's some startups, you know, immediately like, you know, "Okay, these guys are Olympia winners and they're like phenomenal and they're like executing like crazy and they have a track record."

Ali: 嗯，我的意思是，你看，这就像其他所有事情一样。就像我们在大学里给学生打分时，那些明星学生很容易就能识别出来。他们就在那里，然后那些非常非常差劲的人，也很容易识别。然后中间那些人，处于灰色地带。这是一家公司，你知道，我觉得人才并不出色，你不需要是天才也能知道这一点。然后有一些初创公司，你知道，立刻就能看出，“好吧，这些人是奥林匹亚冠军，他们非常出色，执行力惊人，而且有良好的记录。”

Ali: Uh, so I don't think those are that hard, and we try to hire these, and these this is the one that I vetoed. The hard part is what do you do with the ones in the middle?

Ali: 嗯，所以我认为那些并不难，我们努力招聘这些人，而这个是我否决的。难点在于你如何处理中间那些人？

Ben: That's always where you spend all of your energy trying to sus out like, you know, "Okay, they're not stellar, stellar, but maybe they are. Maybe they just didn't have maybe they didn't have the go-to-market, they didn't have the funding, they didn't have the support that they needed," and so on. "Maybe they could if we give them a chance," or "Maybe they're just mediocre." And that's where you spend a lot of your time. But you got to spend time with them. You have to interview all the people. You know, you have to have your people interview all the people. Can't just be this can't be an Excel sheet exercise.

Ben: 那总是你花费所有精力去筛选的地方，你知道，就像：“好吧，他们不是顶尖的，但也许他们是。也许他们只是没有市场进入策略（go-to-market），他们没有资金，他们没有他们需要的支持，”等等。“也许如果我们给他们一个机会，他们就能成功，”或者“也许他们只是平庸。”那才是你花费大量时间的地方。但你必须花时间与他们在一起。你必须面试所有的人。你知道，你必须让你的员工面试所有的人。这不能仅仅是一个 Excel 表格练习。

Ali: Yeah. And Silicon Valley has a lot of lopsided companies. So, you know, you'll have a great engineering team and a bad company because it's like, you know, bad leadership, bad go-to-market. You also can have like guys who can sell anything with a ridiculously like poor engineering team, and they can just sell it and, you know, you got to be very, very careful about that. Actually, our, you know, our CRO at DataBricks is, you know, he came from a company that, you know, he he sell anything.

Ali: 是的。而且硅谷有很多不平衡的公司。所以，你知道，你可能有一个很棒的工程团队，但公司却很糟糕，因为领导力差，市场进入策略（go-to-market）也差。你也可以看到一些人，他们有一个非常糟糕的工程团队，但却能卖出任何东西，而且，你知道，你必须非常非常小心。实际上，我们 DataBricks 的首席营收官（**CRO**：Chief Revenue Officer: 负责公司所有营收生成过程的高级管理人员），你知道，他来自一家，你知道，他能卖任何东西的公司。

Ben: Yeah, he was he was he was he was selling SFTP, secure FTP, which is free.

Ben: 是的，他当时在卖 SFTP，安全的 FTP，那是免费的。

Ali: And he was selling it for a while. He was selling it for a lot. He was making a lot of money. We're saying, you know, the electronic medical health records, you know, how important are they? If they got dropped, you know, how much of a risk is it to your business? Well, this is secure FTP.

Ali: 他卖了一段时间。他卖得很贵。他赚了很多钱。我们说，你知道，电子医疗健康记录，你知道，它们有多重要？如果它们丢失了，你知道，对你的业务有多大风险？嗯，这是安全的 FTP。

Ben: You need it to be secure on somebody grabbing that file. He's good.

Ben: 你需要它在有人抓取那个文件时是安全的。他很厉害。

a16z: Yeah. The only thing I'd add too is this strategy is probably making you more attractive to the people you want to acquire, too. They don't want to sell if they're going to get fired right away.

a16z: 是的。我还要补充一点，这种策略可能也让你们对那些你们想收购的人更具吸引力。如果他们会被立即解雇，他们就不会想卖掉公司。

Ali: Yeah, for sure. It's very competitive.

Ali: 是的，当然。竞争非常激烈。

Ben: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. I mean, you know, there's also a reputation, right? People know like they'll look back and say, "Okay, what happened to your previous acquisitions?"

Ben: 是的，百分之百。是的。我的意思是，你知道，还有声誉问题，对吧？人们会回顾并说：“好吧，你之前的收购怎么样了？”

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: You know, "Was there a huge fight and everybody's quitting left and right?" Or, "You know, did they work out? You know, how are you taking care of those people? You know, are they what roles do they have? Do they have influential roles in your company?" Um, you know, that's also important. So, you're setting a precedent. You're setting a precedent in many, many ways with acquisitions, **M&A** (并购: 公司的合并与收购活动), you know, deal dynamics, the price, the, you know, when you go through the lawyers come back and that you're spending all those 20, 30 days doing the definitive agreement. Every little thing you agree to there is a precedent for the next deal.

Ben: 你知道，“是不是发生了一场大内讧，大家纷纷辞职？”或者，“他们成功了吗？你们是如何照顾那些人的？他们担任什么角色？他们在公司里有影响力吗？”嗯，你知道，这也很重要。所以，你正在开创一个先例。你在很多很多方面都在开创先例，通过收购、并购（M&A）、交易动态、价格，你知道，当你通过律师来回沟通，花费那 20、30 天来签订最终协议时。你在那里同意的每一个小细节，都将成为下一笔交易的先例。

a16z: Yep. Totally. No,

a16z: 是的。完全正确。不，

### 1000亿美元的愿景：思考更大的格局

a16z: Maybe actually just to turn so we're talking about DataBricks as an acquirer. If we go back in time again to maybe a moment where you thought about selling and maybe that, you know, you didn't actually seriously consider that, but I wanted to actually just sort of quote this infamous email sort of circulating our firm that Ben sent to—

a16z: 也许我们把话题转一下，我们正在讨论 DataBricks 作为收购方。如果我们再次回到你曾考虑出售的时刻，也许你并没有真正认真考虑过，但我想引用本发给我们公司的一封臭名昭著的邮件——

Ali: Yeah, Ali brought it. I had forgotten about it. You brought it up at a board meeting.

Ali: 是的，阿里提到了。我忘了那件事了。你在董事会议上提到了它。

a16z: Brought it to the bed. Um, but, uh, and actually this wasn't and this was not pertaining to selling the company, but it was I think selling a a candidate, right? And you you talk about, "Hey, Ben, can you sell this candidate on the fact that we'll be worth 10 billion maybe?"

a16z: 把它带到了床上。嗯，但这实际上不是关于出售公司，我想是关于推销一个候选人，对吧？你谈到：“嘿，本，你能说服这个候选人，我们可能价值 100 亿美元吗？”

Ben: The candidate was worried about the company getting—

Ben: 候选人担心公司会——

a16z: He wanted he wanted to have a **double trigger** (双重触发: 一种股权归属条款，在公司被收购且员工被解雇时加速股权归属) because the company if DataBricks sells, am I and they fire me as a salesperson, what equity am I going to get? So give me double trigger so I'm protected if we get bought and I get fired, I vest all my equity immediately. Yep. Exactly. And so, you know, in response to this, Ben, and I'm gonna paraphrase this a little bit, but, uh, he writes back to you, I'm like thinking about Ben's tone in this, "You are severely underselling the opportunity. We are Oracle in the cloud, and we will be worth 10x what Oracle is." But what was your reaction when you when you saw that? And did that give you more fortitude to not sell the company?

a16z: 他想要一个双重触发条款，因为如果 DataBricks 被出售，而我作为销售人员被解雇，我能得到多少股权？所以给我双重触发，这样如果公司被收购而我被解雇，我的所有股权就能立即归属，我就受到保护了。是的。没错。所以，你知道，为了回应这个，本，我稍微转述一下，他给你回信，我当时在想本的语气，他说：“你严重低估了这个机会。我们是云端的甲骨文（Oracle），我们的价值将是甲骨文的十倍。”但当你看到那封邮件时，你的反应是什么？那是否给了你更大的决心不去出售公司？

Ali: Yeah, Ben's crazy. I think the first thought was exactly, "Ben's crazy." But, uh, but no, I I think both Ben and Mark always kind of pushed us to think bigger.

Ali: 是的，本疯了。我想第一个想法就是：“本疯了。”但是，嗯，不，我认为本和马克总是推动我们思考更大的格局。

Ben: I remember we did the pitch at A16Z for I think our Series D, which would have been around 2017 or so, and the question was asked, "What's your biggest bottleneck?" And I said, "Biggest bottleneck is hiring." He said, "Okay, well, who who who's are you losing to?" And I said, "Well, it's Google, you know, it's the FANGs."

Ben: 我记得我们在 A16Z 做了我们 D 轮融资的推介，大概是在 2017 年左右，当时有人问：“你们最大的瓶颈是什么？”我回答：“最大的瓶颈是招聘。”他说：“好吧，那么，你们输给了谁？”我说：“嗯，是谷歌，你知道，是那些 FANGs 公司。”

Ali: And and the response I got back was, "Well, you need to just add the DataBricks to FANG. It needs to be FANG DB with a straight face." And and it was like, and I was like, and my reaction was I laughed. I literally said, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is not serious." Like it's like, "Yeah, that's the problem." Like, "Huh?" It's like, "No, I'm serious. You need to add DataBricks to FANG, you know?" And and then there was like a pause and there was like this and I think it's doable. And so then I actually went back and thought about it a lot, and I was like, "Is it doable? Like is it am I the crazy one or are they the crazy one? Who's who's nuts here?" And you know and that kind of pushed us to think about how do we change our comp philosophy?

Ali: 我得到的回复是：“嗯，你们需要把 DataBricks 加入 FANG。它需要是 FANG DB，而且表情严肃。”然后我当时就笑了。我真的说：“是啊，是啊。我的意思是，这不严肃。”就像是，“是啊，这就是问题。”就像，“嗯？”他说：“不，我是认真的。你们需要把 DataBricks 加入 FANG，你知道吗？”然后就停顿了一下，然后就是这样，我觉得这是可以做到的。所以后来我真的回去认真思考了很多，我当时在想：“这能做到吗？是我疯了还是他们疯了？这里到底谁疯了？”你知道，那也促使我们思考如何改变我们的薪酬理念？

Ali: Uh, how do we if if we wanted to go and get the best of the best out of Google? What does it require? And we developed a new model, but we're like, "Okay, actually, the way to think about it is your market cap divided by number of employees. That's how much money you can give away in terms of dilution." And actually we did calculated the number at that time, and we're like, "Wait, we're actually richer than Google in terms of, you know, how much dilution we can afford per engineer," because they were at that time—this was like, you know, before the Twitter downsizing—so all the companies were oversized. So we did the calculations, it turned out that we actually can probably pay **P95th percentile** (第95百分位: 表示95%的数据点低于该值，常用于薪酬比较，意指支付高于95%的市场水平). We did the math on P95th percentile for engineering, and it was like, "Yeah, this actually the math works out. We moved all the comp bands and we told them and we told the employees about it. It's like, "Okay, we're paying you P95th, you know, and we can afford it." And so was that came out of that simple, you know, so these simple, you know, "your trillion dollars, just add your acronym to the to FANG" and so on. They're silly and they're kind of crazy, but they do push you. And you go back and think about, "Hey, what is the fundamental reason from first principles that we couldn't do something like that? Why couldn't we be a trillion? What's the bottleneck from being a trillion or being part of Fang?" And then you think about it and you start zooming in on like, "Can we unblock that?" So it it has helped us and has been a driving force even though it's, you know, it's a little annoying. You know, you know, it's like, you know, "Hey, you know, hey, mom, dad, I got the A+. It's like, 'Yeah, but we ranked I was number two in the class, so was someone better than you?'"

Ali: 嗯，如果我们想从谷歌挖走最优秀的人才，需要什么？我们开发了一个新模型，但我们想：“好吧，实际上，思考这个问题的方式是，你的市值除以员工人数。这就是你在股权稀释方面可以给予的金额。”实际上我们当时计算了这个数字，我们发现：“等等，我们在工程师人均稀释额方面实际上比谷歌更富有，”因为他们当时——这就像，你知道，在 Twitter 裁员之前——所以所有公司都过于庞大。所以我们进行了计算，结果表明我们实际上可能可以支付到第 95 百分位。我们对工程领域的第 95 百分位进行了计算，结果是：“是的，这个数学确实行得通。我们调整了所有的薪酬区间，并告诉了他们，也告诉了员工。就像是，“好吧，我们支付你们第 95 百分位，你知道，我们负担得起。”所以这些简单的，你知道，“你的万亿美元，把你的缩写加到 FANG 里”等等。它们很傻，也有点疯狂，但它们确实能推动你。然后你回过头来思考：“嘿，从第一性原理来看，我们为什么不能做那样的事情？我们为什么不能达到万亿市值？成为万亿市值或成为 FANG 的一部分的瓶颈是什么？”然后你思考它，开始聚焦于：“我们能解除那个障碍吗？”所以它帮助了我们，并且一直是一个驱动力，尽管它，你知道，有点烦人。你知道，就像，“嘿，你知道，嘿，爸爸妈妈，我得了 A+。”就像是，“是啊，但我们班我排第二，所以有人比你更好吗？”

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

a16z: Yeah. For what it's worth, when I joined the firm in 2019, the Series F of DataBricks was the first deal I worked on, and I think the the valuation was six billion.

a16z: 是的。就我所知，我 2019 年加入公司时，DataBricks 的 F 轮融资是我经手的第一个项目，当时估值是 60 亿美元。

Ben: Ben says to us, "Oh, well, it's going to be a hundred billion dollar company." And we were like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, Ben." Lo and behold,

Ben: 本对我们说：“哦，嗯，它会成为一家千亿美元的公司。”我们当时想：“是啊，是啊，当然了，本。”果然，

a16z: They're doing all this work. I'm like, "What are you doing?" Like, "Six billion, seven billion, doesn't matter."

a16z: 他们在做所有这些工作。我想：“你在做什么？”就像，“六十亿，七十亿，没关系。”

Ben: I was right.

Ben: 我是对的。

a16z: He was right. Yeah. Yeah. That one you have proven to be right. Yeah. Still have ways to go for two trillion. But

a16z: 他是对的。是的。是的。那一点你已经证明是对的。是的。离两万亿还有很长的路要走。但是——

Ben: Well, the thing that you almost never get and Ali and I had this conversation the one time we did have a real acquisition offer on the company is you just don't get this good a market opportunity with this good an entrepreneur like that. That's the rarest of rare things. Like we we see great entrepreneurs but their market opportunity is limited. And then we see, you know, companies that have a great market opportunity, but the entrepreneur is not big enough to fulfill that. But this was a case where we have both.

Ben: 嗯，你几乎永远得不到的东西，以及阿里和我曾有过的谈话，就是我们确实收到过一次真正的收购要约，那就是你很难遇到这么好的市场机会，同时又拥有这么好的企业家。这是极其罕见的事情。比如我们看到伟大的企业家，但他们的市场机会有限。然后我们看到，你知道，拥有巨大市场机会的公司，但企业家却不足以实现它。但这却是一个我们两者兼备的案例。

Ali: Yeah, I I remember actually the conversation that kind of flipped me. The acquisition offer was on the table. It was six times bigger than the valuation we had at the time. And I had done the mistake of telling my co-founders. And

Ali: 是的，我其实记得那次让我转变想法的谈话。当时收购要约摆在桌面上。它比我们当时的估值大了六倍。而我犯了一个错误，告诉了我的联合创始人。然后——

Ben: Yeah, they were like, "Let's go."

Ben: 是的，他们都说：“我们走吧。”

Ali: They were like, "We're done." So, everyone's like, "Stop the work. Stop working. Take your hands off the keyboard. Nobody work anymore. We're done here." Right? And let's count my money. Like, you know, how much money do I have? You know, what would you buy for that amount of money? You know, so they were like completely like not doing anything. And there's just this crazy gossip going around. And then it was like they had told some of the execs, and then they were calling each other every day like, "Hey, what Ali think? Like, you know, you think he's he looked in a bad mood today? You think he's going to say no, no? It's like, what did he say? Like he said this thing, he said this once." So there's just a lot of politicking going around, and nobody was doing any work anymore. And and I was like, you know, maybe they're right, maybe we should just sell. And I remember having that conversation with Ben, and I think we were in a car, both of us. And, and you know, he says that he drops the f-bombs and he pisses people off and so on and they don't take the feedback. But actually he did exactly the Radical Candor thing with me, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. I'll support you either case. And actually if you sell for this number, it's really great for me, me being Ben. Like we make a lot of money at A16Z. I'll pay the investors back many times over. So honestly, if it's for me personally, that's probably the better option. But I'm just thinking back, I was CEO LoudCloud and Opsware, and you know, just the cards I were given that that company wasn't the company you have. And when I look back, how often do you in in life get a chance to even have a company like LoudCloud or Opsware, let alone a DataBricks. And this is just such a freaking big market. You can sell, you're going to make a lot of money, and you'll be super successful in life. But, you know, if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, you know, I missed that one shot. That was the one thing. I should have taken it all the way. And now I'll never know how far I could have taken it. Could have been."

Ali: 他们都说：“我们完蛋了。”所以，每个人都说：“停下工作。别干了。把手从键盘上拿开。没人再工作了。我们到此为止了。”对吧？然后我们来数钱。就像，你知道，我有多少钱？你知道，你会用那笔钱买什么？你知道，所以他们完全无所事事。然后就传开了各种疯狂的八卦。然后就像他们告诉了一些高管，然后他们每天互相打电话说：“嘿，阿里怎么想的？你知道，你觉得他今天心情不好吗？你觉得他会说不吗？他说了什么？他说了这个，他只说过一次。”所以周围有很多政治斗争，没有人再工作了。然后我想，你知道，也许他们是对的，也许我们应该直接卖掉。我记得和本有过那次谈话，我想我们当时都在车里。而且，你知道，他说他会爆粗口，他会惹恼别人，所以他们不接受反馈。但实际上他对我做的正是《彻底坦诚》的做法，他说：“嘿，你想怎么做都行。无论哪种情况我都会支持你。实际上，如果你以这个价格出售，对我来说真的很好，对我本来说。我们在 A16Z 赚了很多钱。我会多次回报投资者。所以老实说，如果是我个人，那可能是更好的选择。但我只是回想，我曾是 LoudCloud 和 Opsware 的 CEO，你知道，我当时所处的情况，那家公司并不是你现在拥有的公司。当我回首时，人生中你有多常有机会拥有像 LoudCloud 或 Opsware 这样的公司，更不用说 DataBricks 了。而且这只是一个他妈的巨大市场。你可以出售，你会赚很多钱，你的人生会非常成功。但是，你知道，如果你像我一样，你会在余生中回想，你知道，我错过了那一次机会。那是唯一一件事。我本该坚持到底。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。本来可以的。”

Ben: So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? You know, I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less. I really couldn't care less. And I was like, "Okay, thanks. Hang up. We're never doing this. We're done. This is not happening."

Ben: 那么，你是想带着这种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有这笔钱？你知道，无论你做什么，我都会支持。我真的无所谓。我真的无所谓。我当时想：“好吧，谢谢。挂断电话。我们永远不会这样做。我们结束了。这不会发生。”

a16z: What a pep talk.

a16z: 多么鼓舞人心的谈话。

Ali: Yeah. So that's how we did it. So it was it was excellent.

Ali: 是的。所以我们就是这样做的。所以那非常棒。

Ben: I think I also said, "I guarantee you you'll never have an idea this good again as long as you live."

Ben: 我想我还说过：“我向你保证，你这辈子再也不会有这么好的主意了。”

a16z: Yeah.

a16z: 是的。

Ben: This is the best idea you're ever going to have.

Ben: 这是你这辈子最好的主意。

Ali: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, an idea that also takes off and works, right?

Ali: 是的。是的。是的。嗯，一个也能起飞并奏效的想法，对吧？

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

### AI人才战与创业迷思

a16z: Um, so I want to tie one thing that you said in in all of that is you were company building. But then also just sort of the calculus that founders but also your employees are making, and that's around comp. So in the early days you could afford to pay 95th percentile, right? Today there's crazy **AI** (人工智能: 模拟人类智能的科学与工程) talent wars going on. We we've talked about this a bunch throughout the summer. And we know that you can bring the best talent in the house, right, to DataBricks. How do you keep them with all of this craziness going on? Because now 95th percentile, I don't even know what that means. Is that like you pay a billion dollars?

a16z: 嗯，所以我想把你在所有这些话中提到的一点联系起来，那就是你们在建立公司。但同时，创始人以及你们的员工也在进行一种算计，那就是关于薪酬。所以在早期，你们可以支付到第 95 百分位，对吧？今天，人工智能（AI）人才战正在疯狂进行。我们整个夏天已经讨论了很多次。我们知道你们可以把最优秀的人才带到 DataBricks。在这种疯狂的局势下，你们如何留住他们？因为现在第 95 百分位，我甚至不知道那意味着什么。那是不是意味着你们支付 10 亿美元？

Ali: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. The joke is, which company says, "We're P50th?" You know, "We pay P50th." Like, who does that? There's no company that does that. So, how does how does—

Ali: 是的。没错。没错。是的。玩笑是，哪家公司会说：“我们是第 50 百分位？”你知道，“我们支付第 50 百分位。”谁会那样做？没有公司会那样做。那么，如何——

Ben: There is. Yeah. The 75th percentile is the single biggest lie in Silicon Valley. It's like a complete fabrication.

Ben: 有。是的。第 75 百分位是硅谷最大的谎言。那完全是捏造的。

Ali: Probably. Probably. So, um, but, um, you know, I think that, um, the it is a crazy time with AI, and I do think I feel bad. I did actually an exit interview with someone this morning. I feel bad for the kids right now because there's like too much pressure on them. Like they feel like, "Oh, they have to start companies and they have to—" and I've never actually had anything like this because every year I talk to the interns, and, you know, I get questions about, "How do we build our own company? You know, how do we succeed at DataBricks?" And so on. The last two years have just been crazy. All all the kids are like, "When should I become a CEO? When should I start my own company? What's a good valuation? Am I missing out if I do like an internship here for three months at DataBricks? Will I have wasted my opportunity in life? And this is like the time for **AGI** (通用人工智能: 具备理解、学习或应用任何人类智能任务能力的AI). And I could have like been one of the guys that does super intelligence." And like, "You know, how would you time that? How was it for you? How old were you when you were 22? What did you do?" And you know, and so, um, I do think it's it's kind of crazy times, and I do think it's also exaggerated. Like, you know, I don't think anyone's getting hundred million dollar offers. You know, I mean, yes, there's like one, you know, Character AI and so on, but I don't think it's actually true, and it's also in the interest of CEOs, you should know, to say that, "Hey, you know, the, you know, people try to poach data people from DataBricks for a billion dollars, and they said no." Like, it's in our interest to say that, right? Because that kind of sets the bar at a billion, and then any employee that cannot for half of it's going to feel really insulted. It's like, "Why don't I get a billion dollar offer? Like I heard like on the news that the other people are getting a billion."

Ali: 可能吧。可能吧。所以，嗯，但是，你知道，我认为，嗯，现在是人工智能（AI）的疯狂时代，我确实感到难过。我今天早上确实和某人进行了一次离职面谈。我为现在的孩子们感到难过，因为他们承受了太大的压力。他们觉得，“哦，他们必须创业，他们必须——”而我以前从未遇到过这样的情况，因为每年我都会和实习生交谈，你知道，我会被问到：“我们如何建立自己的公司？你知道，我们如何在 DataBricks 取得成功？”等等。过去两年简直是疯狂。所有的孩子们都问：“我什么时候应该成为 CEO？我什么时候应该创办自己的公司？一个好的估值是多少？如果我在 DataBricks 实习三个月，我会错过机会吗？我会浪费我的人生机会吗？而现在是通用人工智能（AGI）的时代。我本可以成为那些创造超级智能的人之一。”然后他们会问：“你知道，你如何把握时机？你当时怎么样？你 22 岁时多大？你做了什么？”你知道，所以，嗯，我确实认为现在是有点疯狂的时代，而且我认为这也有些夸大。比如，你知道，我不认为有人能拿到上亿美元的报价。你知道，我的意思是，是的，比如有一个，你知道，Character AI 等等，但我认为这并不是真的，而且，你也应该知道，CEO 们说这些话也是出于自身利益，他们会说：“嘿，你知道，人们试图以 10 亿美元的价格从 DataBricks 挖走数据人才，但他们拒绝了。”比如，我们说这些话是符合我们利益的，对吧？因为那样就将门槛设定在 10 亿美元，然后任何拿不到一半价格的员工都会感到非常受辱。他们会想：“为什么我没有拿到 10 亿美元的报价？我听说新闻上说其他人拿到了 10 亿美元。”

Ben: By the way, Sam used that in reverse on Meta. He's like, "Oh, yeah, they offered all our guys hundred million dollars into the next guy who got the 50."

Ben: 顺便说一句，萨姆（Sam）在 Meta 上反过来利用了这一点。他就像是：“哦，是的，他们给了我们所有员工 1 亿美元，然后下一个拿到 5000 万美元的人。”

Ali: Now I have to pay 100 at least. Right. That's like the smart move. But I would say that look, you know, and not all startups have the valuation of their we 100 billion and, you know, with 10,000 employees, we actually can afford to actually pay significant and we do pay significant for the right talent. But, you know, if what do you do when you're smaller? Like we were smaller at some point. Well, then it's talk about how big you are going to get and what the opportunity is and what you could do together and what it would worth worth together. But I think most most people earlier in the career, they really want to learn and they want to really feel that they can have impact. So if you can really bring them in and you can sort of mentor them, you can stay close to them, and as a CEO, you have huge power if you can just spend two minutes with, you know, a kid out of school. It's immense to them, and you say, "Hey, you know, I'll I'll even mentor you. I'll help you. Like what what do you want to do in five years? I'm thinking about starting my own company actually in six months, you know, but I'll work at DataBricks for 10 years, but in six months I would love to be a CEO." So then you can say, "Hey, I can coach you to, you know, I I know how the fundraising. I know the early days," and so on. And you can actually mentor a lot of them, and that's actually worth a lot to them as well. But in general, like help them be successful and help them build their careers, and also if you've done it before, like we have, you can kind of calm them down a little bit and say, "Hey, you have like few decades, you know, don't worry about it. It's like it's not, you know, it's the **FOMO** (错失恐惧症: 害怕错过社交活动或投资机会的焦虑) and the pressure, you know, has to be kind of reduced." And I think that's also calming, they feel good about it.

Ali: 现在我至少得付 1 亿。对。那就像是明智之举。但我想说，你看，并非所有初创公司都拥有我们 1000 亿美元的估值，而且，你知道，拥有 10,000 名员工，我们实际上可以负担得起为合适的人才支付高额薪酬，而且我们确实支付高薪。但是，你知道，如果你规模较小，你该怎么办？比如我们曾经在某个时候规模较小。那么，就谈论你未来会变得多大，机会是什么，你们可以一起做什么，以及它会共同创造什么价值。但我认为大多数职业生涯早期的人，他们真的想学习，他们真的想感受到自己能够产生影响。所以如果你能真正把他们带进来，你能指导他们，你能和他们保持密切联系，作为 CEO，如果你能花两分钟和，你知道，一个刚毕业的孩子交谈，你就有巨大的影响力。对他们来说，这意义重大，你会说：“嘿，你知道，我甚至会指导你。我会帮助你。比如你五年后想做什么？我实际上正在考虑六个月后创办自己的公司，你知道，但我会在 DataBricks 工作 10 年，但六个月后我希望能成为一名 CEO。”所以你就可以说：“嘿，我可以指导你，你知道，我了解如何融资。我了解早期阶段，”等等。而且你实际上可以指导他们很多人，这对他们来说也很有价值。但总的来说，就是帮助他们成功，帮助他们建立职业生涯，而且如果你以前做过，就像我们一样，你可以稍微让他们平静下来，说：“嘿，你还有几十年的时间，你知道，别担心。这就像，你知道，是错失恐惧症（FOMO）和压力，你知道，必须有所减轻。”我认为那也能让他们平静下来，他们会感觉良好。

a16z: Yeah. Yeah, I always say the best cure for starting your own company fever is to start your own company and that'll teach you.

a16z: 是的。是的，我总是说，治疗创业热的最好方法就是自己去创业，那会给你上一课。

Ali: It's not that easy.

Ali: 没那么容易。

Ali: By the way, they come back like after start companies, often times they come back to DataBricks and they're much more thankful and you understand, and actually I didn't mention this earlier when you asked about acquisitions. My favorite acquisition, because I said they start with the people, right? And then the product, and with the people, I love to hire people who have seen great at a big company like or I don't know if it's great but they've seen process scale big company, they've been at a Google, they've been at Amazon, they understand the processes so that I understand how to navigate a bureaucracy and work with it and they're not going to just be inundated by it. But then they've gone on and done their own startup, and that's really, really hard, right? It's like it's like extremely hard trying to do everything yourself and you don't have any help and you know you're trying to do this in this crazy market and you're trying to compete with hundred million dollar offers when you have like nothing. So that takes a certain amount of grit and it's really humbling. So I love the people that have done both of those. They end up being actually the perfect employees at DataBricks because they come in and they're really thankful. They're like, "Hey, what these guys have done at DataBricks is actually really, really hard. I tried it and I'm really good. I was like one of the best at Google or somewhere, and then I did my own startup and we absolutely failed. And so, 'Hey, show some respect here.' Like, you know, these guys know what they're talking about." So those are great employees actually. So, you know, I think, uh, keep a great relationship with people who leave your company 'cause they'll they can boomerang back in a couple years.

Ali: 顺便说一句，他们创业之后，很多时候会回到 DataBricks，他们会更加感恩，你会理解的。实际上，你之前问到收购时我没提到这一点。我最喜欢的收购，因为我说他们从人开始，对吧？然后是产品，关于人，我喜欢招聘那些在大公司见过世面的人，比如——我不知道是不是“很棒”，但他们见过大规模的流程，他们曾在谷歌、亚马逊工作过，他们理解这些流程，这样我就知道如何驾驭官僚体系并与之合作，他们不会被其淹没。但后来他们又去创办了自己的初创公司，那真的非常非常难，对吧？就像是，自己做所有事情，没有任何帮助，你知道，在这个疯狂的市场中努力，而且当你一无所有时，还要与上亿美元的报价竞争，这极其困难。所以这需要一定的毅力，而且非常令人谦卑。所以我喜欢那些既有大公司经验又创过业的人。他们最终实际上成为了 DataBricks 最完美的员工，因为他们进来后会非常感激。他们会说：“嘿，DataBricks 的这些人所做的事情实际上非常非常难。我尝试过，而且我真的很优秀。我曾是谷歌或其他地方最优秀的人之一，然后我创办了自己的初创公司，我们彻底失败了。所以，‘嘿，在这里表现出一些尊重。’就像，你知道，这些人知道他们在说什么。”所以那些实际上是很棒的员工。所以，你知道，我认为，与离开你公司的人保持良好关系，因为他们几年后可能会回心转意。

### 创业时机与运气

Ben: Yeah. Yeah. And look, it's it's very hard to make these things work. And and you it also requires a lot of luck. I mean, I think one of the things people don't realize is a lot of things have to go right that should never go right.

Ben: 是的。是的。你看，要让这些事情成功非常困难。而且你也需要很多运气。我的意思是，我认为人们没有意识到的一点是，很多本不该顺利的事情，最终却必须顺利进行。

Ali: Um, and a lot of things will go wrong, but like if you can grab your lucky moments, that's a rare that's a rare thing.

Ali: 嗯，很多事情都会出错，但如果你能抓住你的幸运时刻，那是非常罕见的。

Ben: Yeah. One one way to prove that is if DataBricks started in 2013.

Ben: 是的。证明这一点的一种方式是，如果 DataBricks 在 2013 年成立。

Ali: If we had started in 2012, you know, that rocky year, that difficult year, 2015 would have then happened in 2014. Right? To start the funds, are we not we don't have the revenue. But we were a cloud AI open-source company. Those things didn't take off in 2014. So, you know, even if like if we had to do the CEO change and all of that and I had become CEO a year earlier, it just we were too early in the market. The cloud hadn't taken off. AI was not—nobody that was not even a phrase. AI meant robotics. People use machine learning as the phrase. And so company would have failed. We wouldn't have had enough momentum. There's not enough cloud, you know, **TAM** (潜在市场总量: 某个产品或服务在理想情况下的最大收入机会) there to be had.

Ali: 如果我们是在 2012 年开始的，你知道，那个动荡的一年，那个艰难的一年，那么 2015 年的困境就会发生在 2014 年。对吧？要开始融资，我们没有营收。但我们是一家云端人工智能（AI）开源公司。这些东西在 2014 年并没有起飞。所以，你知道，即使我们不得不进行 CEO 变更等等，如果我早一年成为 CEO，我们只是进入市场太早了。云还没有起飞。人工智能（AI）甚至不是一个流行词。AI 意味着机器人技术。人们用机器学习这个词。所以公司就会失败。我们不会有足够的动力。那里没有足够的云端潜在市场总量（TAM）可供获取。

Ben: If we started the company in 2014, a year later instead, so a year later than we actually did, then we would have had our difficult year in 2016.

Ben: 如果我们把公司创办时间推迟到 2014 年，也就是比我们实际创办晚一年，那么我们会在 2016 年遇到困难。

Ali: But by 2016, the cloud was starting to happen, AI was starting to happen. You know, so we would have done the fixes in 2017, and it would have been too late to late to the party, and probably the **hyperscalers** (超大规模云服务商: 指提供大规模云计算服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、GCP) would have taken it away. You know, our competitors were taking it away, and we were just wouldn't have get enough momentum to be able to succeed, and that's timing of when we started. So, how did we clock it so well? Uh, we had to wait for Mate to finish his PhD thesis. That's it.

Ali: 但到 2016 年，云服务开始兴起，人工智能（AI）也开始发展。你知道，所以我们会在 2017 年进行调整，但那时就已经太晚了，可能超大规模云服务商（hyperscalers）会把市场抢走。你知道，我们的竞争对手正在抢走市场，我们根本无法获得足够的动力来成功，这就是我们创业的时机。那么，我们是如何把握得如此之好的呢？嗯，我们不得不等马特（Mate）完成他的博士论文。就是这样。

Ben: Yeah, that that, you know, that that was the whole thing.

Ben: 是的，那，你知道，那就是全部。

Ali: So, there's a lot of randomness. And you got to get lucky. And and and it was so on the edge as it was that on the Series C, Yan had a handshake with the Redpoint, with Redpoint, and Redpoint just stopped returning his calls to the point where the Series C was led by us, who also led the Series A, and NEA, who led the Series B. Like we co-led the Series C because nobody else would do it. I mean, it was that it was that

Ali: 所以，有很多随机性。你必须走运。而且当时情况非常危急，C 轮融资时，颜（Yan）已经和 Redpoint 握手，但 Redpoint 却不再回复他的电话，以至于 C 轮融资最终由我们（也曾领投 A 轮）和 NEA（领投 B 轮）共同领投，因为没有其他人愿意这样做。我的意思是，当时就是那样——

Ben: Close to going under, and most companies weren't even right that would be it.

Ben: 濒临倒闭，而且大多数公司当时甚至都没有做对。

Ali: Yeah, it was very close because we couldn't get funding for anyone. It's just funding freezed up, and nobody wanted to invest anymore. So it was really a lifeline from A16Z.

Ali: 是的，当时非常接近倒闭，因为我们无法从任何人那里获得资金。资金冻结了，没有人再愿意投资了。所以 A16Z 真是雪中送炭。

Ben: Yeah. We were just, you know, burning a lot of cash. We weren't generating much revenue other than Spark Summit.

Ben: 是的。我们当时，你知道，烧了很多钱。除了 Spark 峰会，我们没有产生多少收入。

Ali: We had a lot of downloads. We had a lot of downloads.

Ali: 我们有很多下载量。我们有很多下载量。

Ben: A lot of downloads.

Ben: 很多下载量。

Ali: And recurring conference revenue.

Ali: 还有经常性的会议收入。

Ben: Yeah. And recurring.

Ben: 是的。而且是经常性的。

a16z: How confident were you in that time when when things were at their level?

a16z: 在那个时候，当情况处于最低谷时，你有多大的信心？

Ali: Oh, I mean, I seriously considered taking the professor job at Berkeley because, uh, I, you know, I seriously thought this was going to be very, very hard to pull off. Um, you know, it's like, you know, I think the sentiment at DataBricks was, or at least my sentiment was, look, you you win some things, you lose some things in life. We created Apache Spark, and we made it a worldwide sensation. Everybody's downloading. The downloads are through the roof. We have this greatest conference. Like, you know, thousands of people come to our conference. It's awesome. Let's go back. Let's do it again. Let's publish another paper and do those kind of things. We're just not business guys. We just don't understand business. You know, that's okay. You know, we don't want to be business guys. So, so that's kind of how I felt about it, right? But what I knew was that, hey, um, you know,

Ali: 哦，我的意思是，我当时认真考虑过接受伯克利大学的教授职位，因为，呃，我，你知道，我真的觉得这会非常非常难实现。嗯，你知道，就像，你知道，我认为 DataBricks 的普遍情绪，或者至少是我当时的情绪是，你看，人生有得有失。我们创造了 Apache Spark，并让它风靡全球。每个人都在下载。下载量飙升。我们有这个最棒的会议。你知道，成千上万的人来参加我们的会议。太棒了。让我们回去吧。让我们再做一次。让我们再发表一篇论文，做那些事情。我们就是不擅长商业。我们就是不懂商业。你知道，那没关系。你知道，我们不想成为商业人士。所以，我当时就是这么想的，对吧？但我知道的是，嘿，嗯，你知道，

Ben: By the way, every Mate went back and became a professor. Like all all this stuff happened.

Ben: 顺便说一句，每个马特都回去当了教授。所有这些事情都发生了。

Ali: Yeah. Yan went back, you know, and um, but, uh, you know, in 2015,

Ali: 是的。颜（Yan）回去了，你知道，嗯，但是，你知道，在 2015 年，

Ben: We knew that we had tried everything. And by the way, **PLG** (产品主导增长: 一种商业策略，通过产品本身吸引、激活和留住客户) is something that we had tried very hard, and it didn't work for us.

Ben: 我们知道我们已经尝试了所有方法。顺便说一句，产品主导增长（PLG）是我们曾非常努力尝试过的东西，但它对我们不起作用。

Ali: Like, you know, actually one of our biggest failures was PLG at DataBricks. Everybody kept telling us, "PLG, PLG, PLG." And we're like, "Okay, product growth. And Amazon didn't just swipe their credit cards. We don't need sales people." So in 2015, I had kind of like—

Ali: 就像，你知道，实际上我们在 DataBricks 最大的失败之一就是产品主导增长（PLG）。每个人都一直告诉我们：“PLG，PLG，PLG。”我们当时想：“好吧，产品增长。亚马逊并没有只刷信用卡。我们不需要销售人员。”所以 2015 年，我有点像是——

Ben: Except Cranny.

Ben: 克兰尼除外。

Ali: Exactly. Yes, that is true. Kudos to Mark. So that year we had like formed some hypothesis that, you know, we have nothing to lose. What if we just pivoted these things? What if we went all in into B2B enterprise sales? You know, 'cause certainly it's not PLG is not working. You know, at 3 million AR, that's not going to take you anywhere. And, you know, and they're just taking our open-source software, so we have to have proprietary code around it. And yeah, the execs team are all PhDs, you know. So what if we bring in someone that doesn't have a PhD and see how it goes. So, so—

Ali: 没错。是的，那是真的。向马克致敬。所以那一年我们形成了一些假设，你知道，我们没有什么可失去的。如果我们只是把这些事情转型呢？如果我们全力投入 B2B 企业销售呢？你知道，因为产品主导增长（PLG）肯定行不通。你知道，300 万的年经常性收入（AR）不会带你到任何地方。而且，你知道，他们只是在使用我们的开源软件，所以我们必须围绕它拥有专有代码。是的，高管团队都是博士，你知道。所以如果我们引入一个没有博士学位的人，看看会怎么样。所以，所以——

Ben: I never forget Arcelon going, "We made the number." And I was like, "You made a ridiculous number." Like, "You made the number." Like, "If you keep making that number, you're going to go bankrupt." Like, "That you didn't make the number. You made a number that you set that was way too low. Like, we haven't figured it out."

Ben: 我永远不会忘记阿塞隆（Arcelon）说：“我们达到了目标。”我当时想：“你达到了一个荒谬的数字。”就像，“你达到了目标。”就像，“如果你继续达到那个数字，你就会破产。”就像，“你没有达到目标。你设定的数字太低了。我们还没有弄清楚。”

Ali: Ben was very nice and complimentary in our board meetings that year, 2015. You know,

Ali: 2015 年那一年，本在我们的董事会议上非常友善和赞赏。你知道，

Ben: We were Yeah, we we were in a bit of trouble.

Ben: 我们当时是的，我们确实遇到了一些麻烦。

Ali: Let's say it was very truthing. But, uh, but yeah, so we had nothing to lose. So we didn't know that we were going to succeed, but we had nothing to lose to make those big changes, and we made them in 2016. And it turned out those were the bottlenecks. You know, giving away your software for free. Not having execs that have seen the movie before, like Ron who came in. And, you know, just the PLG motion is not going to cut it. So maybe we should just try. We weren't certain that B2B would work, but we knew that PLG is not working for sure.

Ali: 姑且说那非常真实。但是，嗯，是的，所以我们没有什么可失去的。所以我们不知道我们是否会成功，但我们没有什么可失去的，可以做出那些重大改变，我们在 2016 年做出了这些改变。结果发现那些就是瓶颈。你知道，免费赠送你的软件。没有见过世面的高管，比如罗恩（Ron）的加入。而且，你知道，仅仅依靠产品主导增长（PLG）是行不通的。所以也许我们应该尝试一下。我们不确定 B2B 是否会奏效，但我们确定 PLG 肯定行不通。

Ben: Yeah. Well, another like I mean, you know, we got Ron—I mean, like the fact that the first sales guy we hired was a sales savant, like a genius. Shock. I mean, like that never happens. And he was a guy we didn't know. Like we like our talent team like found him some from some company we never heard of.

Ben: 是的。嗯，还有一点，我的意思是，你知道，我们得到了罗恩——我的意思是，我们雇佣的第一个销售人员竟然是一个销售天才，简直是奇迹。震惊。我的意思是，这种事从未发生过。而且他是一个我们不认识的人。我们的招聘团队从一家我们从未听说过的公司找到了他。

Ali: Yeah. French company. And the only, really the only reason we hired him was because he was the only guy Cranny ever liked. Like in all the sales guys he ever interviewed, he was like, "This is the guy."

Ali: 是的。一家法国公司。我们雇佣他的唯一，真正的唯一原因是因为他是克拉尼（Cranny）唯一喜欢的人。在他面试过的所有销售人员中，他都说：“就是这个人。”

a16z: Wow.

a16z: 哇。

Ali: And—

Ali: 而且——

Ben: Yeah, he he is a new generation more cr—but we just like stumbled into him. Yeah. Yeah. Like unbelievable. And

Ben: 是的，他是一个新一代的……但我们只是偶然遇到了他。是的。是的。简直令人难以置信。而且——

Ali: Without Ron—

Ali: 没有罗恩——

Ben: Very hard to see us this company getting to where it got to.

Ben: 很难想象我们公司能发展到今天这个地步。

Ali: So there's some luck involved in us even finding him. But then that he was phenomenal, and also kudos to Yan who actually led the search in 2015. So, you know, um, but, uh, yeah, Ron was game-changing for us. But Ron was a very uncomfortable hire.

Ali: 所以我们能找到他也有一些运气成分。但后来他表现出色，也要赞扬颜（Yan），他在 2015 年实际主导了这次招聘。所以，你知道，嗯，但是，是的，罗恩对我们来说是改变游戏规则的人。但罗恩是一个非常令人不安的招聘。

Ben: Because he did not have a PhD.

Ben: 因为他没有博士学位。

Ali: And he—

Ali: 而且他——

Ben: Did have an engineering degree. Yeah, he does have an engineering degree from Stanford that helped a little bit, but he's he's a sales, you know, true and true sales guy. Like he's not a, you know, he's not one of these he's he's a classic sales person, right? Who grew up in sales, even though he has an engineering degree. So, the comfortable thing would have been to pick someone, and we had some candidates in the mix who were super technical, using the product, giving us feedback, but they probably would not, and that would have been much more comfortable for us.

Ben: 确实有工程学学位。是的，他确实有斯坦福大学的工程学学位，这有点帮助，但他是一个真正的销售人员。他不是那种，你知道，他是一个经典的销售人员，对吧？他是在销售领域成长起来的，尽管他有工程学学位。所以，更舒服的做法是选择一个，我们当时有一些候选人，他们技术超强，使用产品，给我们反馈，但他们可能不会，那对我们来说会舒服得多。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: Uh—

Ben: 呃——

Ali: Yeah, Ron was uncomfortable. He was a very uncomfortable hire, and he made it very uncomfortable for us for many years, and he still does.

Ali: 是的，罗恩让人感到不舒服。他是一个非常令人不舒服的雇佣，而且他让我们在很多年里都非常不舒服，现在依然如此。

Ben: But that's a lot of the key to the company.

Ben: 但那是公司成功的关键之一。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: Is it forces—it forces a customer focus that would be impossible to have without somebody that smart and crafty.

Ben: 它迫使——它迫使公司专注于客户，如果没有那样聪明和狡猾的人，这是不可能实现的。

Ali: About getting his way. I mean, just like unbelievable.

Ali: 关于如何达成他的目标。我的意思是，简直令人难以置信。

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: Yeah. If you can keep also the original team together, that's important. We were, you know, seven co-founders still. Many of the co-founders like, you know, you said data warehousing was a big push for us. My co-founder Reynold was really the one that kind of pushed this.

Ali: 是的。是的。如果你能让最初的团队保持在一起，那也很重要。我们当时仍然有七位联合创始人。很多联合创始人，你知道，你提到数据仓库对我们来说是一个巨大的推动力。我的联合创始人雷诺（Reynold）实际上是推动这件事的人。

Ben: Yeah. Like, well, the the contribution level from a large number of co-founders is unique in the industry. I mean, you've got Patrick, you have Rainald, you have Mate, you have Arcelon. I mean, like, it's it's crazy how much the original team contributes.

Ben: 是的。我的意思是，很多联合创始人的贡献水平在行业中是独一无二的。我的意思是，你有帕特里克（Patrick）、雷纳尔德（Rainald）、马特（Mate）、阿塞隆（Arcelon）。我的意思是，最初的团队贡献之大简直令人难以置信。

Ali: Yeah. So the PhDs all contribute. Like Arcelon really made the go-to-market work, you know, and he really made the sort of Ron work with the rest of the company. That was super critical. Mate continued doing lots of innovations over the years. Patrick led all of engineering in big chunks of it, and, you know, so on. And we've had other people, we've been lucky to get such folks. So hiring is critical and keeping the original talent. I think those were some of the things.

Ali: 是的。所以所有的博士都做出了贡献。比如阿塞隆（Arcelon）真正地推动了市场进入策略（go-to-market）的运作，你知道，他真正地让罗恩（Ron）与公司其他部门协同工作。那是非常关键的。马特（Mate）多年来持续进行大量创新。帕特里克（Patrick）领导了大部分的工程部门，你知道，等等。我们还有其他人，我们很幸运能得到这样的人才。所以招聘和留住原始人才至关重要。我认为那些就是其中一些事情。

Ben: Yeah, usually founders usually only one of the co-founders contributes long term. And so to have, you know, to have that going and Yan's still on the board and Scott's still on the board. I mean, like, it's very unusual.

Ben: 是的，通常创始人中，长期贡献的只有一位联合创始人。所以能有，你知道，能有这种局面，而且颜（Yan）还在董事会，斯科特（Scott）也还在董事会。我的意思是，这非常不寻常。

a16z: Yeah, we have a lot more we can get into, but we're at time, so we'll leave it for future episodes of Boss Talk, but this is a great first episode.

a16z: 是的，我们还有很多可以深入探讨的，但时间有限，所以我们把它留到未来的“老板谈话”节目中，但这真是一个很棒的第一集。

Ben: All right, that was fun. Thanks so much.

Ben: 好的，很有趣。非常感谢。

Ali: Thank you so much, guys.

Ali: 非常感谢大家。
