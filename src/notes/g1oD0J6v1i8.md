title: 中国医疗体系的深层病灶：中药注射剂、资源匮乏与认知蒙昧
summary: 本文深入探讨了中国医疗体系面临的严峻挑战，特别是中药注射剂的滥用及其背后的科学性缺失。文章揭示了中国医疗资源分配的严重不公，政府在医疗投入上的不足，以及由此导致的大部分民众被迫接受低效甚至有害医疗服务的现状。同时，也分析了官方宣传如何利用民族主义情绪，加剧了民众对现代医学的认知蒙昧，形成“中草药义和团”现象，最终导致物质和认知的双重剥夺。

### 中药注射剂的危害与专家批判

今天是2025年10月29日，北风呼啸，气温骤降30华氏度，这样的天气很适合制作博客。我们从推特上的一则帖子说起。一位网名为Dr. Wang的推主（我们暂称他为王医生）发布了高质量的推文，本频道第97期节目《你为何老是被人渣盯上》就曾受到他推文的启发。今天，王医生发布了一篇关于**中药注射剂**（Traditional Chinese Medicine Injections: 将中药提取物制成注射剂型，通过静脉或肌肉注射给药）的帖子。他指出，目前中国国内有119种中药注射剂品种，但仅有8家企业提供了上市后的评价情况说明。在帖子结尾，他告诫大家：“为了你的健康，拒绝中药注射剂。”

<p class="english-text">Today is October 29, 2025. The north wind is howling, and the temperature has dropped by 30 degrees Fahrenheit in a day, making it perfect weather for a podcast. Let's start with a post from Twitter. A Twitter user named Dr. Wang (whom we'll refer to as Dr. Wang for now) publishes high-quality tweets; episode 97 of this channel, "Why Are You Always Targeted by Scum?", was inspired by one of his tweets. Today, Dr. Wang posted about **Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Injections** (Traditional Chinese Medicine Injections: pharmaceutical preparations of TCM extracts administered via intravenous or intramuscular injection). He pointed out that currently, there are 119 types of TCM injections in China, but only 8 companies have provided post-market evaluation reports. At the end of his post, he advised everyone: "For your health, refuse TCM injections."</p>
</details>

我在王医生的帖子后面回应道：“中药可以检测中国人的开化程度。”值得注意的是，直到新冠疫情爆发前，中国国内媒体仍能报道中药注射剂的危害，有些标题甚至相当尖锐，例如出现了“**谋财害命**（Fraudulent and life-threatening: 指通过欺骗手段获取钱财并危害他人生命的行为）”这样的词语。当时，一篇广为流传的报道中，**饶毅**（Rao Yi: 北京大学神经科学教授，知名生物学家，对中药注射剂持强烈批评态度）曾痛批中药注射剂是伪科学，是在谋财害命。那时，一些专家还敢于公开表达自己的看法。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I responded to Dr. Wang's post, saying: "Traditional Chinese medicine can gauge the level of enlightenment among Chinese people." It's noteworthy that up until the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic Chinese media could still report on the dangers of TCM injections, with some headlines being quite sharp, even using phrases like "**fraudulent and life-threatening** (Fraudulent and life-threatening: refers to acts of obtaining money through deception and endangering others' lives)." At that time, a widely circulated report quoted **Rao Yi** (Rao Yi: Professor of Neuroscience at Peking University, a renowned biologist who is a strong critic of TCM injections) fiercely criticizing TCM injections as pseudoscience and a fraudulent, life-threatening practice. Back then, some experts still dared to voice their opinions.</p>
</details>

饶毅教授指出，西医是典型的现代科学，与科学完全一致。包括汉族地区在内的各地，可能还有其他传统医学，如果这些医学与科学不一致，将来也会进行改进。因此，不存在独立于现代医学的另一条医学途径。他认为，让传统医学科学化需要一个过程。2016年诺贝尔医学奖的线索就来源于中医中药，但所有相关研究都是基于现代科学方法进行的。现代科学可以从中医中获取线索，造福全人类。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Professor Rao Yi pointed out that Western medicine is a typical modern science, entirely consistent with scientific principles. Various regions, including those inhabited by the Han Chinese, may have other traditional medical practices, and if these are inconsistent with science, they will be reformed in the future. Therefore, there is no alternative medical path independent of modern medicine. He believes that the scientific modernization of traditional medicine requires a process. The clue for the 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine came from traditional Chinese medicine, but all related research was conducted using modern scientific methods. Modern science can derive insights from TCM to benefit all humanity.</p>
</details>

无论何种医学方法，无论是中医还是西医，其核心有两点不变：一是治疗效果，二是副作用不能太大。如果任何医疗方法试图规避这两点检验，那它不仅是伪科学，更是谋财害命。中医中药中确实存在合理成分，但在今天，也有相当不合理的方法。目前，有一批中药厂正大量向全国推销中药，甚至每年有数千亿的销售额来自中药注射剂。饶毅直言，这完全是伪科学，是彻头彻尾的伪科学。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regardless of the medical approach, be it TCM or Western medicine, two core principles remain constant: first, treatment efficacy, and second, manageable side effects. If any medical method attempts to bypass these two tests, it is not only pseudoscience but also a fraudulent and life-threatening practice. While there are reasonable components within traditional Chinese medicine, today, many of its methods are quite unreasonable. Currently, a group of TCM manufacturers are aggressively promoting TCM nationwide, with hundreds of billions in annual sales coming from TCM injections. Rao Yi stated bluntly that this is entirely pseudoscience, a complete and utter pseudoscience.</p>
</details>

饶毅接着解释道，中医中药原本是不做注射的。如果像西医那样大规模向市场推广同一种药，就必须经过科学标准检验。西药能够推广，是因为它们经过了严格的动物实验和人体实验。药物的疗效必须可靠，并获得批准才能使用。然而，一些号称以中药为成分的注射剂，却不经过科学检验，却要求大规模推广。这钻了空子，既绕过了西医严格的检验方法，也绕过了中医不能大量推广的要求。这种做法是彻头彻尾的商业行为，它不是为了中国人民的福祉，而是为了谋财害命。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rao Yi went on to explain that traditional Chinese medicine was not originally administered via injection. If a medicine is to be promoted on a large scale in the market, similar to Western medicine, it must undergo scientific scrutiny. Western medicines are approved for widespread use because they have passed rigorous animal and human trials. The efficacy of a drug must be reliable and approved before it can be used. However, some injections, claiming to be based on TCM ingredients, demand large-scale promotion without scientific testing. This exploits loopholes, bypassing both the strict testing methods required for Western medicine and the TCM principle against widespread promotion. Such practices are purely commercial; they are not for the well-being of the Chinese people but are fraudulent and life-threatening.</p>
</details>

### 中药注射剂的起源与发展

以上是饶毅的原话。结合当时中国媒体的报道，我们看到了中药注射剂**谋财害命**的本质：它采用注射这种现代医学方法，用药却不遵循现代医学的研发、检测和临床实验等基本程序。在化学成分不明、副作用不明的情况下，直接拿病人做动物实验和人体实验。许多病人因此丧命，数十万病人出现不良反应。由于事故频发，中国政府叫停了一些品牌，但大部分中药注射剂仍在继续使用。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The above are Rao Yi's original words. Combined with Chinese media reports from that time, we see the true nature of TCM injections as **fraudulent and life-threatening**: they adopt the modern medical method of injection but do not follow the basic procedures of modern medical research, testing, and clinical trials. With unknown chemical compositions and unknown side effects, patients are directly used for animal and human experimentation. Many patients have died as a result, and hundreds of thousands have experienced adverse reactions. Due to frequent incidents, the Chinese government has halted some brands, but most TCM injections remain in use.</p>
</details>

中药历史悠久，但中药注射剂只有80多年的历史，是**八路军**（Eighth Route Army: 中国共产党领导的军队，在抗日战争时期活跃于敌后战场）在太行山发明的。当时，八路军在敌后根据地根本没有医学研发条件，但由于缺医少药，不得不“土法炼钢”，研制出一种名叫**柴胡注射剂**（Chaihu Injection: 以中药柴胡为主要成分制成的注射剂，曾被八路军用于治疗伤病）的药物，将中药柴胡熬成液体注射到病人伤员的静脉中。没有人知道这种柴胡注射剂到底治好了多少人，又致死了多少人。这种创造发明的唯一原因就是缺少西药。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Traditional Chinese medicine has a long history, but TCM injections only date back about 80 years, invented by the **Eighth Route Army** (Eighth Route Army: The army led by the Chinese Communist Party, active behind enemy lines during the Second Sino-Japanese War) in the Taihang Mountains. At that time, the Eighth Route Army had no medical research and development facilities in their guerrilla bases, but due to a severe lack of medicine, they had to improvise, developing a drug called **Chaihu Injection** (Chaihu Injection: an injectable preparation made primarily from the traditional Chinese herb Chaihu, once used by the Eighth Route Army to treat the sick and wounded). They boiled the TCM herb Chaihu into a liquid and injected it into the veins of patients and wounded soldiers. No one knows how many people this Chaihu Injection actually cured or how many it killed. The sole reason for this invention was the lack of Western medicine.</p>
</details>

80年过去了，中国市场上出现了100多种中药注射剂，它们治好了多少人，致死了多少人，仍然是个谜。缺少西药仍然是它们存在的主要原因，但除了这个原因之外，又多了一个原因——赚钱。这就是饶毅和一些科学家、医生抨击中药注射剂**谋财害命**的根本原因。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Eighty years later, over 100 types of TCM injections have appeared on the Chinese market, and it remains a mystery how many people they have cured or killed. The scarcity of Western medicine is still the primary reason for their existence, but in addition to that, another reason has emerged: profit. This is the fundamental reason why Rao Yi and other scientists and doctors criticize TCM injections as being **fraudulent and life-threatening**.</p>
</details>

### 新冠疫情与医疗资源匮乏

新冠疫情在中国是一个转折点。疫情期间，中国政府推广用中药治疗新冠病毒，媒体不敢再像以前那样批评中药，大部分科学家和医生也不敢再直言说出自己的专业意见。中国以搞运动的方式对付新冠病毒，实施封城清零政策，消耗了大量医疗资源，导致医疗体系吃紧。政府的搜刮速度又赶不上消耗速度，只能往死里压成本，减少采购有效但高价的西药，加大采购药效不明，甚至药效可能有害的中药。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The COVID-19 pandemic marked a turning point in China. During the pandemic, the Chinese government promoted the use of TCM to treat the virus, and the media no longer dared to criticize TCM as before. Most scientists and doctors also refrained from openly expressing their professional opinions. China tackled the COVID-19 virus through campaign-style measures, implementing lockdowns and a zero-COVID policy, which consumed vast medical resources and strained the healthcare system. The government's procurement pace couldn't keep up with the consumption rate, forcing them to drastically cut costs, reduce the purchase of effective but expensive Western medicines, and increase the purchase of TCMs with unclear, or even potentially harmful, efficacy.</p>
</details>

中国医疗制度的特点是把人分成三六九等，金字塔顶端的一小部分人拥有大部分医疗资源，而巨大的金字塔底盘只拥有少得可怜的医疗资源。对于金字塔顶部那些医疗资源丰富的中国人来说，吃中药只是一种选择。但对于大部分中国人来说，吃中药是没有选择，因为像样的西药太贵，超出了他们的负担能力，甚至根本就排除在了医保范围之外。中国的医保分为体制内和体制外，体制内又分级别。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Chinese healthcare system is characterized by a hierarchical division of people, where a small fraction at the top of the pyramid possesses the majority of medical resources, while the vast base of the pyramid has pitifully few. For those at the top with abundant medical resources, taking TCM is merely an option. However, for the majority of Chinese people, taking TCM is not an option because decent Western medicines are too expensive, beyond their financial reach, or even excluded from medical insurance coverage. China's medical insurance is divided into "within-system" and "outside-system," with further stratification within the "within-system" category.</p>
</details>

中国大部分人口在体制外，享受不到多少医疗资源，医保根本没几个钱给他们买像样的西药。大部分中药制作成本低廉，不值钱，就成了主要选项。因此，在很大程度上，中药现象在中国是一个现代医疗资源匮乏的问题。什么时候体制外的中国人医疗资源达到了台湾、韩国、日本，甚至达到了俄罗斯、古巴的水准，就没那么多人选择吃中药了，更没那么多人迷信中药了。这本质上是个医疗资源匮乏的问题。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The majority of China's population is outside the "system" and has limited access to medical resources; their medical insurance provides very little money for decent Western medicines. Most TCMs, being cheap to produce and of low value, become the primary option. Therefore, to a large extent, the phenomenon of TCM in China is a problem of scarcity of modern medical resources. When the medical resources available to Chinese people outside the system reach the standards of Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, or even Russia and Cuba, fewer people will choose TCM, and fewer will blindly believe in it. This is fundamentally a problem of medical resource scarcity.</p>
</details>

“西药治病，中药说不定”这个道理，连我小时候村里的小脚老太太都明白。省城的医院比县医院好，县医院比公社医院好。村里只有赤脚医生和老中医，老中医比赤脚医生有经验，但是村民得了重病，赤脚医生和老中医都治不了，而是要去县医院，因为县医院有像样的西医。如果县医院也治不了，而且钱还没花光的话，再去省城的医院，因为那里有更好的西医。中国医疗资源匮乏的状况并没有随着经济发展出现根本改善。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Even the elderly women with bound feet in my village when I was a child understood the principle: "Western medicine cures diseases, TCM is uncertain." Hospitals in provincial capitals are better than county hospitals, and county hospitals are better than commune hospitals. In the village, there were only barefoot doctors and old TCM practitioners. While old TCM practitioners were more experienced than barefoot doctors, if a villager fell seriously ill, neither could cure them; they had to go to the county hospital because it had decent Western medicine. If the county hospital couldn't cure them, and they still had money, they would go to the provincial capital hospital, where there was even better Western medicine. The scarcity of medical resources in China has not fundamentally improved with economic development.</p>
</details>

### 医疗支出与国际比较

根据**世界银行**（World Bank: 致力于向发展中国家提供资金和技术援助的国际金融机构）2020年的数据，中国在医疗方面的支出占GDP的5.59%，在世界上排名第120位，低于赞比亚、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯、利比亚这些非洲国家。利比亚的医疗支出占GDP的6.6%，阿尔及利亚是6.3%，突尼斯是6.2%，赞比亚是5.7%，而中国是5.59%。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to 2020 data from the **World Bank** (World Bank: an international financial institution that provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries), China's healthcare expenditure accounts for 5.59% of its GDP, ranking 120th in the world, lower than African countries like Zambia, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Libya's healthcare expenditure is 6.6% of GDP, Algeria's is 6.3%, Tunisia's is 6.2%, Zambia's is 5.7%, while China's is 5.59%.</p>
</details>

大部分发达国家的医疗支出占GDP超过10%，美国最高，占到18.8%，德国占12.8%，日本占11.5%，韩国占8.4%。就连俄罗斯的医疗支出都能占到GDP的7.6%，而且实行**全民医保**（Universal Healthcare: 由政府提供或资助，旨在确保所有公民都能获得医疗服务的制度）。中国以前学苏联，现在跟着俄罗斯站队，但最贴近民生的一样东西——全民医保，中国却不学。苏联时期就是这样。苏联解体以后，俄罗斯把免费医疗作为公民的基本权利写进了宪法。到现在30多年，不管俄罗斯经济怎么样起伏，全民医保政策一直没变。

<p class="english-text">Most developed countries spend over 10% of their GDP on healthcare; the United States is highest at 18.8%, Germany at 12.8%, Japan at 11.5%, and South Korea at 8.4%. Even Russia's healthcare expenditure accounts for 7.6% of its GDP, and it implements **universal healthcare** (Universal Healthcare: a system where the government provides or funds healthcare services to ensure all citizens have access). China used to follow the Soviet Union and now aligns with Russia, but it fails to adopt one of the most crucial aspects for its people's well-being: universal healthcare. This was the case during the Soviet era. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia enshrined free healthcare as a basic right for its citizens in its constitution. For over 30 years since then, regardless of Russia's economic fluctuations, its universal healthcare policy has remained unchanged.</p>
</details>

以前中国政府说国家穷没钱花在医疗上，但是加入世贸后这20多年，中国发展成了中等收入国家，但其医疗投入却仍然维持低收入国家的水平。体制外的大部分国民得了大病仍然没钱治，被迫用中药糊弄，顶多再加点劣质西药。政府医疗投入严重不足，医疗资源肯定就会紧张。还是根据世界银行的统计，每1000名国民的医生比例，中国排在利比亚、吉尔吉斯斯坦、土库曼斯坦、厄瓜多尔这些国家后面。中国人看不起这些国家，但这些国家的国民人均享有的医疗资源高于中国人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Previously, the Chinese government claimed the country was poor and lacked funds for healthcare. However, in the 20-plus years since joining the WTO, China has developed into a middle-income country, yet its healthcare investment still remains at the level of low-income nations. Most citizens outside the system with serious illnesses still cannot afford treatment, being forced to make do with TCM, at most supplemented with some low-quality Western medicine. The government's severe underinvestment in healthcare inevitably leads to strained medical resources. According to World Bank statistics, China ranks behind countries like Libya, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Ecuador in terms of the doctor-to-1000-population ratio. Chinese people may look down on these countries, but their citizens enjoy more per capita medical resources than the Chinese.</p>
</details>

### 医疗资源分配不均与认知剥夺

看看这些数字已经够可怜的了，但是即便看这些可怜的数字，还要考虑中国特色的体制内外差异和城乡差异。跟很多国家不同，中国大部分医疗资源分配给了20%的大中城市人口，80%的农村和小城镇人口可能连20%的医疗资源都分配不到。一多半的国民基本被排除在了现代医疗资源的门槛以外。他们得了病不吃中药、不打中药注射剂，还能吃什么、还能打什么呢？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These figures are already dismal, but even when considering these poor statistics, one must also account for China's unique disparities between those within and outside the system, and between urban and rural areas. Unlike many countries, the majority of China's medical resources are allocated to the 20% of the population in large and medium-sized cities, while the 80% in rural areas and small towns may not even receive 20% of the medical resources. More than half of the population is essentially excluded from the threshold of modern medical resources. If they fall ill and don't take TCM or TCM injections, what else can they take or be injected with?</p>
</details>

这些年中国媒体报道了一些儿童打中药注射剂的死亡事件，大多发生在中小城镇的医院，很少发生在北上广深这些大城市。显然，很多受害者是小城镇家庭的孩子，还有农村家庭的孩子。中国大部分国民生活在农村和小城镇，对于他们来讲，对于他们的孩子来讲，中药和劣质西药是唯一负担得起的医药。至少中药可以作为一种安慰剂，有毒没毒、副作用大小则全靠运气。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In recent years, Chinese media have reported several deaths of children due to TCM injections, mostly occurring in hospitals in small and medium-sized towns, rarely in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. Clearly, many victims are children from small-town families, as well as rural families. The majority of Chinese citizens live in rural areas and small towns, and for them and their children, TCM and low-quality Western medicine are the only affordable options. At the very least, TCM can serve as a placebo; whether it's toxic or not, and the extent of its side effects, is entirely a matter of luck.</p>
</details>

中国政府推出的这副中药安慰剂有个必不可少的配方，就是官方宣传部门的舆论诈骗，把中药说得神乎其神、博大精深，是老祖宗五千年的遗产，比现代医学还高明。这种舆论诈骗专门针对那些体制外吃不起西药的中国人，尤其是住在农村和小城镇的中国人。体制内的中国人，尤其是高级干部，没有几个相信这种舆论诈骗话术的。现实中，有头有脸的领导病了，医生不给开进口药，你看他家属去不去找院长？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An indispensable ingredient in the TCM placebo promoted by the Chinese government is the propaganda department's public opinion fraud, which portrays TCM as miraculous, profound, a 5,000-year legacy from ancestors, and superior to modern medicine. This propaganda specifically targets Chinese people outside the system who cannot afford Western medicine, especially those living in rural areas and small towns. Few Chinese people within the system, especially high-ranking officials, believe this propaganda. In reality, if a prominent leader falls ill and doctors don't prescribe imported medicine, do you think their family wouldn't go complain to the hospital director?</p>
</details>

那些药都是发达国家生产的，都是西药，都很贵，不会用到99%的中国人身上。因为中国政府在医疗方面投入严重不足，医疗资源紧张，再加上有限的医疗资源分配严重不均，大多数中国人生了病得不到符合现代医学标准的医治。都21世纪20年代了，中国都世界第二大经济体了，但大部分中国人的医疗条件跟80年前相比没有多少长进。生了病只能吃点中草药，唯一的进步是可以打中草药注射剂了。中草药注射剂这种玩意儿，用现代医药标准衡量的话，就是个草菅人命的玩笑。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those medicines are produced in developed countries, are all Western medicines, and are very expensive, thus not used by 99% of Chinese people. Because the Chinese government's investment in healthcare is severely insufficient, medical resources are strained, and the limited resources are severely unequally distributed, most Chinese people who fall ill do not receive treatment that meets modern medical standards. It's already the 2020s, and China is the world's second-largest economy, yet the medical conditions for most Chinese people have not significantly improved compared to 80 years ago. When ill, they can only take some herbal medicine; the only "progress" is the availability of herbal injections. Measured by modern medical standards, herbal injections are a deadly joke.</p>
</details>

中国的高官病了不会去吃中草药，更不会去打中药注射剂，而是去看西医，吃进口药。金字塔底盘的群众被剥夺了像样的医疗资源，这已经是很不幸了，但是更不幸的是，很多中国人被官方舆论诈骗糊弄得滴溜转，连分辨是非善恶、分辨高低优劣的能力也没有了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">High-ranking Chinese officials, when ill, do not take herbal medicine, much less receive TCM injections; instead, they see Western doctors and take imported medicines. The masses at the bottom of the pyramid are deprived of decent medical resources, which is already unfortunate. But even more tragic is that many Chinese people are so thoroughly misled by official propaganda that they lose the ability to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and superior from inferior.</p>
</details>

可以说，这是中国人的双重不幸。第一层是物质上的剥夺，就是剥夺他们生病时得到符合现代医学标准的治疗机会。第二层是认知上的剥夺，就是摧毁他们的正常认知，让他们主动去是非颠倒、优劣颠倒。一个人长期处于只有劣质选项的环境当中，会逐渐丧失分辨优劣的能力。他们没见过好的，只见过坏的。但是在这个信息时代，虽然有墙，他们也不可能完全没听说过好的。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This can be described as a double misfortune for the Chinese people. The first layer is material deprivation: denying them the opportunity to receive treatment that meets modern medical standards when they fall ill. The second layer is cognitive deprivation: destroying their normal cognition, leading them to actively invert right and wrong, and superior and inferior. A person living long-term in an environment with only inferior options will gradually lose the ability to distinguish quality. They haven't seen good things, only bad ones. Yet, in this information age, despite the Great Firewall, it's impossible for them to have never heard of good things entirely.</p>
</details>

同时，他们又知道那个传说中的好东西自己根本就没机会得到。这会激发他们一种奇特的心理防御机制：“我得不到的都是坏的，我能得到的才是最好的。”通过这种奇特的心理防御机制，本来是受害者的社会金字塔底盘，就主动加入了官方的舆论诈骗行列。

<p class="english-text">At the same time, they know they will never have the opportunity to obtain those fabled good things. This triggers a peculiar psychological defense mechanism: "What I cannot get is bad; what I can get is the best." Through this strange psychological defense mechanism, the base of the social pyramid, originally victims, actively joins the ranks of official propaganda.</p>
</details>

听众对那套舆论诈骗话术肯定不会陌生，比如说“西药治标不治本，中药才治本”，“西药是化学品，副作用大，中药是纯天然、无毒无害、没有副作用”，“进口药都是受资本操控，都是外国的阴谋”。这就是当代中国人特有的**中草药义和团**（TCM Boxer Rebellion: 指中国社会中盲目排斥现代医学、狂热推崇中医药，并带有民族主义和反智主义色彩的群体现象）现象，蒙昧、排外、自我欺骗是他们的特点。

<p class="english-text">Listeners are certainly familiar with that propaganda rhetoric, for example: "Western medicine treats the symptoms but not the root cause, only TCM treats the root cause," "Western medicine is chemicals with many side effects, while TCM is pure, natural, non-toxic, and harmless with no side effects," "Imported medicines are all controlled by capital, all foreign conspiracies." This is the unique phenomenon of the contemporary Chinese **TCM Boxer Rebellion** (TCM Boxer Rebellion: refers to a social phenomenon in China characterized by the blind rejection of modern medicine, fervent promotion of traditional Chinese medicine, and imbued with nationalism and anti-intellectualism), whose characteristics are ignorance, xenophobia, and self-deception.</p>

通过阿Q式的精神胜利法，他们把我得不到的那种痛苦转换成了我不要的那种自大。他们本来是被政府剥夺了优质资源的受害者，现在却成了劣质资源的未到式。从启蒙的角度看，这是一种蒙昧状态，认知蒙昧、优劣颠倒、自娱自虐。他们不但害自己，他们也害他们的下一代，害他们的孩子从小生活在这种不幸当中。很多人就麻木了，也有很多人养成了口是心非的习惯。

<p class="english-text">Through an Ah Q-style spiritual victory, they transform the pain of "I cannot get it" into the arrogance of "I don't want it." They were originally victims deprived of quality resources by the government, but now they have become proponents of inferior resources. From an enlightenment perspective, this is a state of ignorance—cognitive ignorance, inversion of superior and inferior, self-amusement, and self-abuse. They harm not only themselves but also their next generation, causing their children to grow up in this misfortune. Many become numb, and many others develop the habit of saying one thing and meaning another.</p>
</details>

只有到了性命攸关的时刻，才想到要对自己诚实一点。平常他们吹嘘中医博大精深，但真是病得不行了，大夫问他是吃中药还是吃进口药，他们会毫不例外地都要进口药。**孔子**（Confucius: 中国古代思想家、教育家，儒家学派创始人）说“看人要听其言观其行”。当代中国在各种精神鸦片制造的幻觉中屈从心泛滥，太多的口是心非，很多场合听其言已经毫无意义，直接观其行就可以了。从科学的角度看，中国的中草药义和团无异于是慢性自杀。

<p class="english-text">Only when life is at stake do they think about being honest with themselves.

Contemporary China, under the illusion created by various spiritual opiates, is rampant with subservience and hypocrisy. In many situations, listening to words has become meaningless; one can simply observe actions. From a scientific perspective, China's TCM Boxer Rebellion is tantamount to chronic suicide.</p>

中国在世界上排名第120位的超低医疗支出，还要再被**中草药义和团**的利益集团收割，割以刀，比较典型的就是各种草菅人命的中药注射剂，再比如大家耳熟能详的那个靠新冠瘟疫起家的**莲花清瘟胶囊**（Lianhua Qingwen Capsule: 一种中成药，在新冠疫情期间被中国政府大力推广，但其疗效和安全性备受争议），都是这种货色。

<p class="english-text">China's ultra-low healthcare expenditure, ranking 120th in the world, is further exploited by the interest groups of the **TCM Boxer Rebellion**, who profit immensely from it. Typical examples include various life-threatening TCM injections, and the well-known **Lianhua Qingwen Capsule** (Lianhua Qingwen Capsule: a traditional Chinese patent medicine heavily promoted by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 pandemic, but whose efficacy and safety are highly controversial), all of which are of this ilk.</p>

这两年中国政府搞医疗行业反腐运动，跟其他反腐运动一样，结果肯定是越反越腐败。它一手吹捧起来、一手扶植起来的中草药，可以说就是中国医疗行业最大的腐败。这种腐败、这种诈骗是体制性的，是国家行为。它消耗了本来就少得可怜的医疗支出，提供了低得可怜的疗效，甚至直接拿病人做动物实验和人体实验。当巨额医保资金花在那些疗效不详的种草药和同样疗效不详但风险极高的中药注射剂上时，本来就十分紧缺的医疗资源当然就更紧缺了。

<p class="english-text">In the past two years, the Chinese government has launched an anti-corruption campaign in the healthcare sector, and like other such campaigns, the result is inevitably more corruption. The traditional Chinese medicine that it has promoted and supported can be said to be the biggest corruption in China's healthcare industry. This corruption, this fraud, is systemic and a state-sponsored act. It consumes already meager healthcare expenditures, provides pitifully low efficacy, and even directly uses patients for animal and human experimentation. When huge amounts of medical insurance funds are spent on herbal medicines with unknown efficacy and TCM injections with equally unknown efficacy but extremely high risks, the already scarce medical resources naturally become even more strained.</p>

不少中国知识分子说中国人蒙昧是因为党国洗脑，但是中国人的蒙昧并不是从党国开始的，而是一直蒙昧，党国只是把他们锁定在既有的蒙昧状态中不让他们出来。1937年7月14日，两位曾经留学哈佛的学者在清华园散步，一位是**吴宓**（Wu Mi: 中国现代著名学者、文学家、教育家），另一位是**陈寅恪**（Chen Yinque: 中国现代著名历史学家、古典文学研究家）。当时七七事变刚刚爆发，民国风雨飘摇。谈到时局的时候，陈寅恪说了一句意味深长的话：“中国之人下愚而上诈。”吴宓把这句话写在日记当中，后来出版了。

<p class="english-text">Many Chinese intellectuals say that the Chinese people are ignorant because of Party-state brainwashing, but the ignorance of the Chinese people did not start with the Party-state; they have always been ignorant, and the Party-state merely locks them into their existing state of ignorance, preventing them from emerging. On July 14, 1937, two Harvard-educated scholars, **Wu Mi** (Wu Mi: a renowned modern Chinese scholar, writer, and educator) and **Chen Yinque** (Chen Yinque: a renowned modern Chinese historian and classical literature scholar), were strolling in Tsinghua Garden. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident had just broken out, and the Republic of China was in turmoil. Discussing the current situation, Chen Yinque uttered a profound statement: "The Chinese people are ignorant below and deceitful above." Wu Mi recorded this in his diary, which was later published.</p>

判断中国的时局离不开判断中国人。陈寅恪对中国人的判断就是**上诈下愚**（Upper Deception, Lower Ignorance: 指统治者狡诈欺骗，而民众愚昧无知，是陈寅恪对中国社会结构的深刻洞察）。到今天，中国这种上诈下愚的官民结构也没有改变。官府狡诈，国民愚昧，这是义和团生长的沃土。党国开动宣传喉舌，把国民无限期锁定在愚昧的笼子当中，这是孕育中草药义和团的土壤。

<p class="english-text">Judging China's situation is inseparable from judging the Chinese people. Chen Yinque's assessment of the Chinese people was **"upper deception, lower ignorance"** (Upper Deception, Lower Ignorance: refers to rulers being cunning and deceptive, while the populace is ignorant and foolish, a profound insight by Chen Yinque into China's social structure). To this day, this official-civilian structure of upper deception and lower ignorance in China has not changed. Officialdom is cunning, and the populace is ignorant; this is the fertile ground for the growth of Boxer-like movements. The Party-state mobilizes its propaganda apparatus, locking the populace indefinitely in a cage of ignorance, which is the soil that nurtures the TCM Boxer Rebellion.</p>

中国这一百多年，每当官府和社会底盘出现共振，离发生重大人祸就不远了。官府要医疗行业反腐，中草药义和团就要打倒万恶的外国药厂。医生开进口药就成了白衣恶魔。越反智、越反科学、越反专业标准，中药的市场就越大。坚持职业操守的医学人士就越被边缘化。如今，多年积累的制度性亏欠都到了还账期，中草药义和团用他们和他们的孩子的健康来支付制度性亏欠的巨额账单。

<p class="english-text">For over a century in China, whenever there is a resonance between the officialdom and the social base, a major man-made disaster is not far off. When the government calls for anti-corruption in the medical industry, the TCM Boxer Rebellion calls for overthrowing evil foreign pharmaceutical companies. Doctors prescribing imported medicines become "white-clad devils." The more anti-intellectual, anti-science, and anti-professional standards, the larger the market for TCM becomes. Medical professionals who uphold their ethics are increasingly marginalized. Today, years of accumulated systemic debt are coming due, and the TCM Boxer Rebellion is using their and their children's health to pay the enormous bills of this systemic deficit.</p>

欠账终归是要还的，不是以这种方式还，就是以那种方式还。当官方舆论诈骗和中草药义和团的共振达到一个临界点，一场人祸就难以避免，到头来谁能跑得了呢？

### 中医哲学的局限性与“How”的问题

在以前的节目中，我们讲过中药作为一种文人雅趣是不错的，像琴棋书画、诗词玄学一样，都是讲一些听起来高明的不得了的东西。比如**《皇帝内经》**（Huangdi Neijing: 中国现存最早的中医理论经典，奠定了中医的理论基础）说“**圣人不治已病治未病**（A sage treats not the sick, but the not-yet-sick: 《黄帝内经》中的一句名言，强调预防疾病的重要性）”，即圣人不治已经犯的病，而是治还没犯的病，防患于未然。高明不高明？当然高明。问题是“how”——怎么不治已病治未病？
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In previous episodes, we discussed that TCM, as a scholarly pastime, is quite good, much like zither, chess, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and metaphysics, all of which discuss things that sound incredibly profound. For example, **"The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon"** (Huangdi Neijing: the earliest existing classic of Traditional Chinese Medicine theory, laying the foundation for TCM theory) states, "**A sage treats not the sick, but the not-yet-sick** (A sage treats not the sick, but the not-yet-sick: a famous quote from "The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon," emphasizing the importance of disease prevention)," meaning a sage treats diseases before they manifest, preventing them from occurring. Is this profound? Of course, it is. The question is "how"—how does one treat the not-yet-sick?</p>
</details>

西医或者说现代医学的答案很清楚：它发明了疫苗，建立了定期查体这样一些规范。西医不是不知道“不治已病治未病”，不是不知道预防比治疗好，但他跟中医有个重大区别，就是不仅知道这些大道理，而且知道怎么样运用技术把这些大道理变成药品，变成可以操作的专业流程。而中医只是停留在大道理的阶段，大而无当的悬想，讲得头头是道，但是只要问一句“how”，就露馅了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Western medicine, or modern medicine, has a clear answer: it invented vaccines and established norms like regular check-ups. Western medicine is not unaware of "treating the not-yet-sick" or that prevention is better than cure. However, it has a significant difference from TCM: it not only understands these grand principles but also knows how to use technology to transform these principles into medicines and actionable professional procedures. TCM, on the other hand, remains at the stage of grand principles—broad and impractical conjectures that sound convincing, but as soon as you ask "how," the facade crumbles.</p>
</details>

中医要跟中国的传统哲学一样，大道理一堆，就是没有一句实验的具体分析和技术性思路。说好听一点，这是想象丰富；说不好听一点，就是思维粗糙，思维还没有细致到对宏大观念做技术分析的程度。大道理当然重要，但没有具体的技术支持，大道理就只是停留在想象的层面。具体到医学领域，预防胜于治疗的大道理当然很重要，但研发出预防的药物，比如说研发出疫苗，同样重要。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">TCM, like traditional Chinese philosophy, is full of grand principles but lacks any specific experimental analysis or technical thinking. To put it nicely, this is rich imagination; to put it less nicely, it's crude thinking, not yet refined enough to conduct technical analysis of grand concepts. Grand principles are certainly important, but without concrete technical support, they remain at the level of imagination. Specifically in the medical field, the grand principle that prevention is better than cure is undoubtedly important, but developing preventive medicines, such as vaccines, is equally crucial.</p>
</details>

我们不是生活在理想世界，而是生活在现实世界。在现实世界，我们不仅要知道理想状态是什么，也要知道如何发展出一步一步接近理想目标的技术手段。理想谁都有，问题是怎么实现理想？这就是个“how”的问题。在中国传统当中，这个“how”就像一堵墙挡在那里，一边是文人理想飞舞，另一边是全民老牛拉炮车。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do not live in an ideal world, but in the real world. In the real world, we must not only know what the ideal state is but also how to develop technical means to approach that ideal step by step. Everyone has ideals, but the question is how to achieve them? This is the "how" question. In Chinese tradition, this "how" stands like a wall, with scholarly ideals soaring on one side and the entire populace pulling a cart like old oxen on the other.</p>
</details>

中医药基本上就是这种传统的产物。跟西医或者说跟现代医药相比，它的效果怎么样？哪一个高？哪一个低？哪一个优？哪一个劣？看一下古代御医伺候的中国皇帝平均寿命，再看一下现代医学伺候的当今国家领导人的寿命，你只要智力还有救，肯定知道答案。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Traditional Chinese medicine is essentially a product of this tradition. Compared to Western medicine, or modern medicine, how effective is it? Which is superior? Which is inferior? Look at the average lifespan of ancient Chinese emperors served by imperial physicians, then look at the lifespan of contemporary national leaders served by modern medicine; if your intellect is still salvageable, you will certainly know the answer.</p>
</details>

### 蒙昧的悲剧与社会责任

但是在现实当中，有那么多人，如果智力有救的话，也不会成为**中草药义和团**。有位国内的同学人很善良，有一次他说：“看那些迷信中医的人，可怜又可怯。生病没钱治，吃中药方子自生自灭。国家不给他们提供质量过得去的现代医疗，他们反倒觉得中医厉害，到处骂指出问题的人。这种愚昧让人看不到希望。”
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in reality, there are so many people who, if their intellect were salvageable, would not become part of the **TCM Boxer Rebellion**. A kind classmate from China once said: "It's pitiful and timid to see those who blindly believe in TCM. They get sick, have no money for treatment, and rely on TCM prescriptions to fend for themselves. The state doesn't provide them with decent modern healthcare, yet they think TCM is amazing and curse anyone who points out the problems. This kind of ignorance makes one lose hope."</p>
</details>

他说的就是墙内的这些中草药义和团。他们围攻过饶毅，围攻过一些质疑中药注射剂的医生。面对这种愚昧，普通人又能奈何呢？人格有命，除了叹息一声，还能怎么样？认知决定命运。愚昧的人丧失了认知能力，他们的命运、他们孩子的命运都是由别人来决定的。**庄子**（Zhuangzi: 中国古代思想家，道家学派代表人物）说这是**井底之蛙**（Frog in a well: 比喻见识短浅、目光狭隘的人）的命运。中国这口井实在是太大了，历史也太长了，在里面蹦跶几下就能产生飞翔的幻觉。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was referring to these TCM Boxer Rebellion members within China. They have attacked Rao Yi and other doctors who questioned TCM injections. Faced with such ignorance, what can ordinary people do? One's character is fate; what else can one do but sigh? Cognition determines destiny. Ignorant people lose their cognitive abilities, and their fate, as well as their children's fate, is decided by others. **Zhuangzi** (Zhuangzi: an ancient Chinese philosopher, a representative figure of Taoism) said this is the fate of a **frog in a well** (Frog in a well: a metaphor for someone with limited knowledge and narrow views). China's well is truly vast, and its history too long; a few leaps inside can create the illusion of flying.</p>
</details>

很多搞**国学**（Chinese traditional culture/studies: 指中国传统文化和学术，包括儒、释、道等思想体系）搞中药的人就是这种境界。当然不是所有搞国学搞中药的人都是这样，有些人见过世面，见过大海，有些人明白国学中药都是饭碗，谋财但不害命。如今中国却已经走到了中药注射剂这种谋财害命的东西大行其道的地步。

<p class="english-text">Many people involved in **Chinese traditional culture/studies** (Chinese traditional culture/studies: refers to traditional Chinese culture and scholarship, including philosophical systems like Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) and TCM are in this state. Of course, not all people involved in Chinese studies and TCM are like this; some have seen the world, seen the ocean, and understand that Chinese studies and TCM are livelihoods, designed to make money but not to harm lives. However, China has now reached a point where fraudulent and life-threatening things like TCM injections are rampant.</p>

### 总结：医疗体系的根本问题与双重不幸

说到这里，我们可以做个小结。对于金字塔顶端的中国人来说，看中医、吃中药是一种选择，因为他们享有很好的西医资源，也就是享有很好的现代医学资源。他们可以把中医中药作为一种补充或者调剂。但是对于大部分中国人来说，看中医、吃中药、打中药注射剂是没有选择。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this point, we can summarize. For Chinese people at the top of the pyramid, seeing a TCM doctor and taking TCM is an option because they have access to excellent Western medical resources, meaning excellent modern medical resources. They can use TCM as a supplement or an adjustment. However, for the majority of Chinese people, seeing a TCM doctor, taking TCM, and receiving TCM injections is not an option.</p>
</details>

像样的西医离他们太远，像样的西药太贵，不在医保范围内。所以归根到底，中医中药、中药注射剂现象的根源是中国现代医疗资源匮乏，而现代医疗资源匮乏的直接原因是中国政府医疗支出占GDP比重太低，低到不如很多非洲国家。中国政府的解决办法不是加大医疗投入，更不是合理分配医疗资源，而是把医疗政治化，搞中草药民族主义，煽动中草药义和团。它发动宣传喉舌，吹嘘中医博大精深，迫使医疗集采向中药倾斜。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Decent Western medicine is too far away for them, and decent Western medicines are too expensive and not covered by medical insurance. Therefore, fundamentally, the root cause of the TCM, herbal medicine, and TCM injection phenomenon is the scarcity of modern medical resources in China, and the direct reason for this scarcity is that the Chinese government's healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP is too low, even lower than many African countries. The Chinese government's solution is not to increase healthcare investment, much less to rationally allocate medical resources, but to politicize healthcare, promote herbal medicine nationalism, and incite the TCM Boxer Rebellion. It mobilizes its propaganda apparatus to boast about the profoundness of TCM, forcing centralized medical procurement to favor TCM.</p>
</details>

但中国的领导干部病了不是去吃中草药，更不是去打中草药注射剂，而是去看西医，吃进口药。处于金字塔底端的国民被剥夺了像样的医疗资源，这已经是很不幸，但是更不幸的是，很多人连分辨是非善恶、分辨高低优劣的能力也被阉割了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, when Chinese leaders fall ill, they do not take herbal medicine, much less receive herbal injections; instead, they see Western doctors and take imported medicines. The citizens at the bottom of the pyramid are deprived of decent medical resources, which is already unfortunate. But even more tragically, many people have also had their ability to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and superior from inferior, castrated.</p>
</details>

中国经济繁荣、国库充实的时候，政府不是把钱花在改善民生、建立医疗保障这些社会安全网上面，而是过度搞基建，满世界大撒币。这几年中国经济进入下行螺旋，民生方面的亏欠越演越烈，医疗支出更是捉襟见肘。哪里没钱，哪里就会出问题。问题大了，社会就会动荡，动荡的临界点就会爆发。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When China's economy was prosperous and its treasury full, the government did not spend money on improving people's livelihoods and establishing social safety nets like healthcare, but instead over-invested in infrastructure and liberally disbursed funds globally. In recent years, as the Chinese economy has entered a downward spiral, the deficits in public welfare have intensified, and healthcare expenditure has become even more constrained. Where there is no money, problems will arise. When problems become severe, society will become unstable, and a tipping point of unrest will erupt.</p>
</details>

这些年不少中国人跑到海外生活，一些中草药义和团也带着中药罐子跑出来了。如果你在美国生活，享有充分的现代医疗资源，却相信中药比西药高明，身边都是些信中药偏方的大妈大叔，那不是美国的问题，也不是中药西药的问题，而是你的朋友圈出了问题。归根到底是你的认知出了问题。俗话说“物以类聚，鸟以群分”，人也一样。今天的话说完了，下期再见。

<p class="english-text">In recent years, many Chinese people have moved abroad, and some members of the TCM Boxer Rebellion have also emerged with their herbal pots. If you live in the United States, enjoying full access to modern medical resources, yet believe that TCM is superior to Western medicine, and your social circle consists of aunts and uncles who trust TCM folk remedies, then that's not a problem with the United States, nor with TCM or Western medicine; it's a problem with your social circle. Ultimately, it's a problem with your cognition. As the saying goes, "Birds of a feather flock together," and people are no different. That concludes today's discussion; see you next time.</p>
