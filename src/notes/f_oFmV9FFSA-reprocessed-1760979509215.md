### 本周市场展望

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场前瞻。现在是周日，距离股市开盘还有14分钟。感谢大家的到来，我们有很多内容要讨论。希望大家周末过得愉快，是时候迎接市场开盘了。过去48小时感觉很漫长，我已经有些紧张，准备好重返市场了。上周无论是情绪上还是财务上都充满了起伏，但我很兴奋能重新投入。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market futures. We are live folks. It is Sunday. We've got 14 minutes until once again the stock market opens up. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to discuss. We got a lot to get into. Hope everyone had a good weekend. It's time to open up the markets. Dude, it's been a long 48 hours. I have got the jitters. I am ready to get back into these markets. It was a long week last week in terms of all the emotionals up and down. little not only the the emotional up and downs, but the uh actual financial up and downs. But I'm excited. I'm excited to get back into it.</p>
</details>

这将是有趣的一周。我不知道最终是喜悦的泪水还是幸福的泪水，但总会有一些泪水，我们最终会以某种方式一笑置之。本周有特斯拉和Netflix的财报，这将是重头戏，正式拉开大型科技公司财报季的序幕。上周，台积电（TSM）的财报表现出色，还有ASML以及所有银行和非必需消费品公司，除了几家地区性银行外，整体表现都很好。周五公布财报的其他地区性银行表现也不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is going to be a fun week. Uh hopefully it's going to be well it'll be fun. I don't know if it'll be uh you know tears of joy or tears of happiness, but there's going to be some tears that eventually we'll we'll laugh about in some way. Uh we've got Tesla and Netflix earnings. So, we'll talk about that. That's going to be big this week. It officially starts off big tech. last week had a great earnings for for uh well not for tech but for TSM which was one of the tech companies that reported ASML and uh all the banks and consumer discretionary companies pretty much good across the board except a couple of the regionals we'll talk more about that but the other regionals on Friday were pretty good.</p>
</details>

本周，我们将迎来特斯拉和Netflix的科技股财报。周五将公布**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 即消费者物价指数，是衡量通货膨胀的关键经济指标）。由于政府仍处于关门状态，我不确定CPI的发布流程会是怎样，但除了CPI，我们不会得到任何其他的宏观数据，所以周五的数据将非常重要。此外，特朗普和习近平将在10月底、11月初在韩国会晤。因此，我认为本周你可能会得到更多关于谈判将如何进行的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so we're going to continue tech earnings into this week with Tesla and Netflix we got CPI on Friday again the government is still shut down so I don't know what the CPI process is going to look like but we're not going to get any other macro data outside of CPI so that'll be important on Friday uh and then Trump and Xi are going to be meeting towards the end of October, early November in South Korea. So, uh I think this week you're probably going to get a bit more of an update in terms of what those negotiations are going to look like.</p>
</details>

中国在周末表现得相当友好。他们说了一些你意想不到的话，似乎不想表现得非常敌对，而特朗普在周五的评论中也做出了某种程度的回应。所以我认为，我们将对谈判的走向有更清晰的了解。我们会看到一些财报，一些宏观数据，希望政府关门问题也能有一些谈判进展。我们拭目以待，希望情况不会太糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China over the weekend pretty friendly. I mean, they said some stuff that you wouldn't think would would uh entail, but they want to be super hostile and Trump kind of reciprocated with some of his comments that he made on Friday as well. So, I think we'll get more negotiations or more understanding of what the negotiations look like. we will get some of these earnings and uh we'll get some macro data with CPI and hopefully a little bit of a negotiation for the shutdown. We'll see how that plays out, but hopefully it's not too bad.</p>
</details>

### 频道更新：新成员、线下活动与写作热情

在进入正题之前，有三项事务性公告。首先，我们正式扩大了AK Media团队，并全职聘用了一位成员——Cactus Jack。每天在聊天室的朋友可能都认识他。他现在是AK Media的全职成员，基本上是我们的个人**彭博终端**（Bloomberg Terminal: 金融专业人士广泛使用的数据、分析和新闻平台）。我说的“我们”是指整个聊天社区，因为他在每个开盘和收盘时段为我们提供市场动态和新闻的速度和奉献精神都非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Three announcements logistically and then we'll keep actually three and then uh then we'll get started with everything that we got going on. number one, and they might not be in the chat right now, but they probably will be in the chat. Market open, market close. Uh, folks, we have officially extended the AK media team and brought someone on fulltime. Cactus Jack. Those of you who are in the chat every day probably recognize Cactus Jack. He is now full-time with AK Media. So, Cactus Jack is essentially our personal Bloomberg terminal. And when I say hour, I mean the entire chat because the level of speed that he has dedicated to getting us updates and news about what's going on in the stock market, every single market, open, market, close has been remarkable.</p>
</details>

一周前我问他：“兄弟，你为什么每天都这么做？”他说他只是喜欢这里，喜欢我们建立的社区。我觉得让他每天免费做这些事很过意不去，而且既然他每天都在，我们不妨将这种关系正式化。他同意了。所以，Cactus现在正式成为团队的一员。他的全职工作就是研究市场，获取最新动态。这真的能帮助我更好地完成我的工作，即实时传达所有信息和更新。有一个我可以信赖的可靠来源，确保我们能实时传达发生的一切，这对很多人来说非常重要，因为他们在交易时会根据头条新闻做出决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh you know, a week ago, I mean, I've seen him for like two years in the chat. A week ago, I'm just like, "Bro, like why are you doing this every day?" And he was just like, "Wow, I just love being here. I love the community you built." And I'm like, "Okay, well, I feel bad that you're doing this every single day for free. Uh, and I also think we might as well formalize this relationship if you're going to be here anyway." And, uh, he said, "Let's do it." So, Cactus is officially part of the team. his full-time job now is to just research, get updates on the market. And it it really is going to help me do my job better, which is communicating all the information and finding all the updates in real time. And uh having a trusted source that I can rely on and make sure that we can convey everything that's happening in real time, which, you know, for a lot of people, you make decisions based on the headlines that come up when you're trading. That's really important.</p>
</details>

第二项更新。迈阿密活动之后，我告诉大家我真的想在2026年更认真地对待线下聚会，包括策划、后勤、基础设施、安保等所有事情。从纽约的50人到迈阿密的350人，这个有趣的想法变成了一个真正的社区建设活动。我意识到，如果要做，就应该把它做好。昨天我与一家公关管理机构开了一次会，会议非常成功。一切都很合拍，我非常喜欢昨天见到的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second update. So, I told you guys post Miami that I really want to take the meetups more seriously in 2026 in terms of planning, logistics, infrastructure, security, all this stuff. Like basically, it was a fun idea in my head to do these meetups. The fun idea manifested into like a real community building event from 50 people in New York to 350 people in Miami. And it kind of dawned on me that if we're going to do this, we should do this. I had a meeting yesterday with a PRmanagement agency and uh it was a very good meeting. Like it was a it was one of those meetings where it's like it's clicking on all cylinders and I really like the people that I met yesterday.</p>
</details>

目前还没有正式确认合作，他们11月会来泽西，届时我会和他们面谈。我做决定很多时候凭直觉。这次会议让我非常兴奋，因为这不是一家超级大的经纪公司，而是一个在那里工作了10年的人自己出来创业。这意味着我不会只是他们众多客户中的一个，我甚至可能是她的第一个客户，她会非常有动力把事情做好。我们的目标是为那些在投资领域没有社区的人们创造一种体验，并在世界各地成功地举办活动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No confirmed official deal. They're going to be in Jersey in November and then I'm gonna meet them in person. I make decisions a lot of times based on intuition. based on the meeting I had yesterday, uh very very excited for it. And and the cool thing about the meeting I had yesterday is this is not some super super big like management talent agency yada yada. This is one person who spent 10 years working at that agency and now she's starting her own firm. And that's what really got me excited because I would not just be one client that's part of like the cog in the machine of all these other people that the agency manages. I would be like one of honestly I don't even know if she has any other clients. I mean, she literally quit five weeks ago. So, like I think I might be her first client, which means she would be very motivated to get the job done and really take this to the next level. The vision is how do we create an experience for people that don't have a community uh in investing and do it across the world and do it in a way that can be successful.</p>
</details>

我们已经在多伦多、波士顿、迈阿密、加州和纽约举办了五次聚会，证明了需求是存在的，但现在我们需要把它结构化。如果年底前能敲定合作，那么在全球范围内规划场地将变得容易得多。第一个地点很可能是一月份的纽约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I showed that there is demand for this but now we got to make it structured and so I am very very excited for that. Again, we don't have an official deal yet, but uh I think if we can get that deal done by the end of the year, then the planning of venues across the world is going to get a lot easier. The first location I can I think I've already said this before, but the first location, likely will be New York in January.</p>
</details>

第三个更新是关于Substack。我感觉自己爱上了写作。通常我周六会休息，不考虑股票和市场，但我已经开始着手下两篇深度分析了，分别是关于BMR和Duolingo。坐下来整理思绪，不是说出来而是写出来，这个过程虽然有点烦人，有点难，但我真的很想拥抱这个新挑战。非常感谢所有订阅的人。深度分析文章没有付费墙，任何人都可以随时阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yes, the third update. Dude, the substack. You guys have been absolutely like just it's it's been I think I'm falling in love with writing, dude. Like this thing is cool. I you know, usually I take Saturdays off to like just like not think about stocks and the market and stuff. I already started working on the next two deep dives. I have already started working on the next two deep dives. So the companies were BMR and Duolingo. the the the process of really sitting down with your thoughts and not speaking them, but writing them out, it's annoying. It's hard. I like don't love it as much as I love talking. But it's a new challenge and and quite frankly, I I really am wanting to embrace this challenge. So, deeply deeply appreciate anyone who subscribed. If you didn't, I'll put the link in the chat. There was no payw wall. So for anyone who wants to read the deep dives, you can uh read it whenever you want.</p>
</details>

我也在考虑很多其他的想法，比如Palantir的Q3财报，我通常会做视频，但我也想把我的想法写出来。Robin Hood即将发布财报，我也想写下我的看法。这个周末，周六，我竟然在研究和打字，准备接下来的两篇深度分析，我心想，天哪，我不知道我会这么喜欢这件事。这对我来说就像是内容创作的新生命。非常感谢所有订阅的人，它将永远免费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm thinking of so many other ideas, too, like Palanteer's Q3 earnings. Like usually I make a video on that. I'll continue to make a video on that. But I also would want to write out my thoughts on Palunteers's earnings. Robin Hood has earnings up coming. I want to write out my thoughts on Robin Hood. like just the process of writing. Like literally this weekend, bro, on Saturday, I'm over here getting ready on the next two deep dives and I'm starting to research and type and I'm like, damn, bro. I didn't know I would like it this much, but there's something about it that I really do freaking enjoy. And uh it's kind of like a new life for me in terms of content creation. Deeply deeply appreciate anyone who subscribed. It will be free forever.</p>

### 开盘速览与市场动态

好了，我们还有两分钟开盘，然后会讨论一系列头条新闻。对于没看到的朋友，股指期货是绿色的。我很期待看到市场如何开盘。当然，这可能是周日晚间市场的低流动性所致，到周一早上可能就消退了。但比特币和以太坊终于不像之前那么疲软了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so we got two minutes and then we got a bunch of headlines. We'll get into those headlines. Futures are green for those that didn't see it. Uh very excited to see how this market opens. I mean, look, it's it could it could be a low liquidity Friday or not Friday, Sunday overnight markets and this fades by Monday morning. But you do have Bitcoin and Ethereum that are finally not being as weak as they were.</p>
</details>

我已经决定要买SoFi了，甚至可能今晚就动手。我准备用500股的仓位赌一把财报。如果涨了，我想和大家一起庆祝；如果没涨，我也会和大家一起继续持有。我希望能以26.50美元或更低的价格买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have decided I will be buying SoFi. I might even do it tonight. I'm taking a SoFi 500 shares earnings gamble. I'm doing it because if it goes up, I want to be celebrating with everybody else. If it doesn't, I'll be back holding with everybody else. So, I kind of want to get it at like 2650 and below.</p>
</details>

好了，隔夜市场将在15秒内开盘。让我们看看价格走势，然后进入头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, overnight markets. They should be opening in 15 seconds. Let's see some of this price action. see what we got. Then we'll get into the headlines.</p>
</details>

隔夜市场开盘了。Robin Hood 132美元，出现了一根绿色蜡烛图，上涨了2%。Palantir 178美元，上涨约0.3%。特斯拉440.80美元，我们有一些关于它的更新要讨论，而且它即将发布财报。英伟达上涨约0.8%。标普500指数也是绿的。AMD微涨。SoFi 26.83美元，上涨1%。Grab 5.71美元，也是绿的。Google 253美元，绿的。Reddit、Amazon都上涨。Meta持平。Salesforce上涨。基本上全线飘绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overnight markets are open hoodie 132. There's a green candle. That's up 2%. Palanteer right here at 178. That's green by about a third of a percent. Tesla, we got some updates on Tesla. We got to talk about that. 440.80. Uh, we do have earnings on Tesla, so that's going to matter as well. Nvidia, that's green, up about 08%. S&P, that's green. AMD, that's up a little bit. SoFi, 2683. All right, we're up 1% of the day on SoFi. Grabby Grab 571, that's green. Google 253, that's green. Reddit, that's up. Amazon, that's up. Meta, that's flat. Salesforce is up. You pretty much got green across the board.</p>
</details>

Amkor盘前交易量可能很低，但从31美元涨到了32.38美元。黄仁勋（Jensen）在他今天的一个采访中确实提到了Amkor。我们稍后会播放那个采访并讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, no. Well, it got to move 3230. It's probably very low volume but up from 31 to 3238. Jensen literally mentioned AMC in an interview that he did today. So we'll we'll play the interview and we'll talk about it.</p>
</details>

GameStop的CEO Ryan Cohen明天将在一个播客上直播。他很久没有接受采访了，我很想听听他对GameStop的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">GameStop's up a little bit. Oh, the Game Store um or GameStore, GameStop CEO, what's his name? Ryan Cohen, he'll be live tomorrow on uh TBPN, which is like this tech bros podcast thing. And uh he'll be live at 12 p.m. Eastern. I'm going to be curious to see kind of how he talks about GameStop. He hasn't done interviews in a long time. So, we'll see what Mr. Ryan Cohen has to say.</p>
</details>

我深度分析过的公司之一是Duolingo。在研究之后，我非常尊重这家公司，首要原因是我在文章中谈到的他们的数据优势。在研究和写作时我意识到，大型科技公司在语言学习这个特定领域并没有Duolingo那样的数据优势。我真的认为这里存在护城河。不过，我在文章末尾解释了为什么我没有建仓，主要是估值问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Duolingo, so Duolingo was one of the companies I did a deep dive on. I have a lot a lot of respect for Duolingo after that deep dive and and the number one reason why is the section where I talk about their data advantage. Like as I was writing that and researching it, it made me realize, dude, big tech doesn't have the data advantage that Dualingo has. And I know that's crazy to say, but in this specific niche about language learning, I really do think there is a moat. Now, I go on to say at the end of the article why I I'm not establishing a position, but I I I don't think people are going to be upset in five years buying dual like I think it will outperform the market, which is what you care about, right? I just it's not enough. It's not I'm not confident the value. If you go through the valuation section, it's not like, oh my goodness, this is the most compelling opportunity ever.</p>

### 英伟达在美国生产芯片与AI革命

好了，让我们来看一些头条新闻。我想我们从黄仁勋开始。他今天早上接受了福克斯的采访，内容很棒，说了很多我认为非常重要的事情。英伟达的大新闻是，上周五，也就是收盘后，英伟达和台积电宣布，他们有史以来第一次在美国开发出了用于Blackwell芯片的晶圆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right cool. Let's get into some headlines. I think we'll start off with Jensen, dude. Jensen did an interview on Fox this morning. Great interview. Uh said a lot of stuff that I think is really important. The big headline for uh Nvidia is that on Friday, this was after the market closed. I think right when the market close ended, we shared the headline. Uh Nvidia and TSMC have officially developed the wafer for the Blackwell chip in America for the first time ever.</p>
</details>

以下是黄仁勋对此的看法，以及他如何进一步阐述美国半导体的再工业化。

> **主持人：** 当特朗普总统今年早些时候首次宣布关税时，你的公司受到了相当大的冲击。但周五，你宣布将在美国开始生产AI芯片的晶圆。能告诉我们更多关于你的计划吗？
>
> **黄仁勋：** 是的，上周是历史性的一周。我们第一次在美国，在世界上最先进的晶圆厂，制造了世界上最先进的AI芯片。这一切都始于特朗普总统希望重振美国工业。他的关税是促使我们以如此快的速度实现这一目标的推动力。

黄仁勋在这里给了特朗普很多功劳，说关税是他们能做到这一点的原因。这对英伟达的股东来说是好事，因为他保持了政治上的一致性。显然，对于美国的半导体再工业化项目，黄仁勋正引领潮流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is what Jensen had to say about that and how he went further into the re-industrialization of America for semiconductors. >> So when President Trump first announced tariffs earlier this year, your company was hit pretty hard. On Friday, though, you announced that you're going to start making the wafers for AI chips in the United States. Can you tell us more about what your plan is? Yeah, this last week was a historic week. Uh we manufactured the most advanced AI chips in the world in the most advanced fab in the world here in America for the first time. Uh all of this started with President Trump wanting to reindustrialize the United States. His terrorist was a pressing uh agent in making this possible at this at the at the speed that we're doing. Jensen just said his tariffs were a pressing agent in making this happen. So you got Jensen giving Trump a lot of credit right there saying the tariffs are the reason why we're able to do this. That's probably what Trump wants to hear. It's, you know, good for Nvidia shareholders for him kind of staying aligned that way. And obviously for the American re-industrialization project around semiconductors, Jensen is leading the way.</p>
</details>

> **黄仁勋：** 在不到一年的时间里，我们现在正在美国制造用于AI的最先进芯片。这仅仅是个开始。通过与台湾供应链的合作，台积电是美国不可思议的战略合作伙伴，将技术最关键领域的制造业带到美国。这只是起点，之后我们将与富士康、Amkor、SPIL、纬创等众多合作伙伴一起，将整个构建AI基础设施的供应链带回美国。到未来三四年结束时，我们有望制造约五千亿美元的AI超级计算技术，并安装在美国。

他提到了Amkor。这是少数几家能在美国进行封装的公司之一，与台积电合作非常紧密。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And now at uh uh just in shortly after less than a year, we're now manufacturing the most advanced chips for AI here in the United States. This is just the beginning of it. Uh with the partnership of the supply chain in Taiwan, TSMC is in incredible partner in a strategic partner for United States and in bringing manufacturing of the most in most critical sector of technology here to to United States. Uh this is just the starting point where after that with Foxcon, Amcor, Spill, uh Wistron, so many of our other partners, we're going to bring the entire entire supply chain of building AI infrastructure back here in the United States. By the end of uh the next three or four years, we'll probably manufacture we're on on target to manufacture about half a trillion dollars of AI supercomputing technology to be installed here in the United States. >> Amcore mention. We got the Amcore mention. One of the only companies that can do packaging in the United States, works very closely with TSM.</p>
</details>

> **主持人：** 你说这是在美国生产的最重要的芯片。它有什么特别之处让你这么说？
>
> **黄仁勋：** 嗯，英伟达处于中心位置。我们是人类历史上最大工业革命的引擎。我们正在创造人工智能，这种数字智能将增强我们所做的一切。它将影响每一个行业。我们正处于这场工业革命的开端。我们现在已经制造了数千亿美元的这款名为Blackwell的芯片。你给它通电，它处理信息，输出的就是数字智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you were in Arizona at the plant on Friday. You said there that this is the single most important chip being produced in America. What does it do that makes you say that? Well, Nvidia is at the epicenter. We're the engine of the largest industrial revolution uh in human history. The last ones were steam engine, electricity, information technology. And now we're creating artificial intelligence, digital intelligence that augments all of the things that we do. It's going to affect every single industry. There's not one industry that's not affected by intelligence, of course. And so this is going to revolutionize every single industry. We're at the beginning of that industrial revolution. We've manufactured now several hundred billion dollars of this chip called Blackwell. You apply electricity to it. It processes you know information and what comes out of it is digital intelligence.</p>
</details>

> **主持人：** 你的公司股价在过去三年左右上涨了1500%。这是可持续的吗，还是我们正处于AI泡沫中？
>
> **黄仁勋：** 我们实际上正处于这场工业革命的开端。要理解AI，你需要把它想象成一个工厂。这个工厂需要能源。这是特朗普总统为美国科技产业做的最重要的事情之一，就是认识到能源对这个产业的增长是必要的。我们正处于这段旅程的最初阶段。在未来十年，我们还有数万亿美元的AI基础设施需要建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In the last 3 years or so, and we can put this up on the screen, your company's stock is up 1,500% because of the surge in AI demand. Is that sustainable or are we in an AI bubble? >> We're actually at the beginning of this industrial revolution. The way to think about AI is that in order for AI to be produced, you need a factory. That factory takes energy. This is one of the most important things that President Trump did for the technology industry here in the United States is to recognize that energy is necessary for this industry to grow. President Trump's pro-energy initiatives has made it possible for us to sustain our growth. We're about hundred couple hundred billion dollars into this journey. We have trillions of dollars of AI infrastructure to build throughout the next decade. And so this is a just in the very very beginning part of that journey.</p>
</details>

> **主持人：** 你说下一代美国百万富翁将是水管工和电工。为什么这么说？
>
> **黄仁勋：** 我们将不得不建造这些宏伟的工厂。用于芯片、封装、AI超级计算机的工厂，以及生产数字智能的工厂。所有这些工厂都需要非凡的熟练技艺。我们国家需要庆祝这些技艺行业，因为它们资源严重不足。我们需要大量的水管工、电工、技术员。任何工业革命都需要熟练的技艺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But you now are saying that the next generation of US millionaires are going to be plumbers and electricians. We have a lot of plumbers and electricians watching right now. Why is it that you say that they are going to become millionaires? Well, we're going to have to build these magnificent factories. Magn magnificent factories for chips, for packaging, for these AI supercomputers, but also for these factories that are producing digital intelligence. All of these factories requires extraordinary skilled craft. This is something that that uh our country needs to to really really celebrate that the the the the the skill craft professions are are severely um uh underresourced. We just don't have nearly enough of them. Plumbers, electricians, uh technicians, networking networking technicians building out these incredible factories. We need a lot of them. Hundreds of thousands of them, maybe even millions of them. And so we're at the beginning of this new industrial revolution. And any industrial revolution requires skilled craft.</p>
</details>

### 中美科技博弈：黄仁勋与Palantir的不同视角

显然，黄仁勋对这场AI革命非常乐观。华尔街似乎也同意他的看法，汇丰银行上周将英伟达的目标价上调至320美元，这意味着公司市值将达到7.5万亿美元。他们认为英伟达不是泡沫，我们确实处于开端。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I mean look, you've got Jensen obviously very bullish on this AI revolution. You know what else is he going to say? He's he's also talking his book. But Nvidia is putting up the growth to be able to justify that which is, you know, why it is more believable than not. Last week HSBC updated Nvidia or upgraded them to 320. uh they which would be a $7.5 trillion company. So you got a lot of the Wall Street firms saying, "Look, we agree with Jensen. It's not a bubble. We indeed are at the beginning.</p>

然而，一个可能影响英伟达增长的因素是在中国的销售问题。几天前，黄仁勋谈到了中国，他含蓄地批评了不让英伟达向中国销售的政策。

> **黄仁勋：** 我们希望能够创造出世界赖以构建的美国技术。中国拥有全球约50%的AI研究人员。我认为，不让这些研究人员在我们的美国技术上构建AI是一个错误。我们需要一种微妙的策略，一种随着时间变化的策略，让美国在保持领先的同时，继续赢得世界各地的研究人员。目前，我们100%退出了中国市场。我们的市场份额从95%降到了0%。我无法想象任何决策者会认为这是一个好主意。

<details>

<p class="english-text">However, one argument to support, not the bubble argument, but rather the argument that maybe Nvidia is not going to be able to put up that growth is the lack of selling in China. Here's what Jensen said a couple days ago uh about China. >> We hope that we could create American technology that the world's built upon. Well, a lot of the AI researchers are in China. You know, China has about 50% of the world's AI researchers. Uh, incredible schools, incredible focus in AI, lots of passion around AI. And I think it's a mistake to not have those researchers build AI on American technology. I think that's a mistake. And so the question is how how do you balance winning staying ahead on the other hand ensuring that the world builds on American tech stack that's the balance and in order to balance you have to have nuance and it it's probably not you know all or nothing and so nuance a nuance strategy that that that um uh changes that that um uh you know is is a uh changing over time uh has a a you know that allows United States to stay ahead while we continue to win researchers around the world is probably the right balance and and that that's what I would advocate at the moment uh we are 100% out of China and so China is 0% of we went from 95% market share to 0%. >> and so I can't imagine any policy maker thinking that that's a good idea that whatever policy we implemented uh caused one of caused America to lose one of the largest markets in the world to 0%.</p>

另一方面，Palantir的首席技术官Shyam Sankar周五在《华尔街日报》上发表了一篇专栏文章，标题是《为什么对华温和派是错的》，最初的标题是《黄仁勋在中国问题上是错的》。Shyam的观点并非针对英伟达，而是强调我们正处在一个与中国的关键时刻，如果我们不解决问题，即为我们自己的生存创造所需的一切——首先是半导体，然后是药品和无法外包的劳动力——将会非常危险。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now Sham Sanker CTO of Palunteer he wrote an article uh on Friday and the title is why the China dubs are wrong. the original title why it was Jensen Huang is wrong about China and I think that got a lot of well it got a lot of clicks got a lot of people seeing what Sham is saying but they kind of changed it to why the China dub is wrong. what did Sham say if you read the article? It's not really a critique of Jensen per se. It's not even like a hey Nvidia sucks or anything. Sham clarified his thoughts after he posted the article saying Nvidia is a great you know American company. It's rather the question of dude this is not a joke like we are in a moment with China that if we don't figure out how to resolve it aka create all of the stuff that we need to we need to create for ourselves to survive which is semiconductors first and foremost pharmaceuticals labor that can't be outsourced and ruin American jobs. All of that stuff is super super important.</p>
</details>

Shyam一直想说的是，中国共产党不是一个我们可以轻易谈判的对象，我们必须采取强硬立场。他可能认为，英伟达以增强美国技术栈为由向中国出售芯片的理由，不足以成为美国泄露技术的借口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think what Sham has been trying to say and what he's been talking about really for the past couple years now is the Chinese Communist Party is not someone that we can easily negotiate with and we have to have a hardline stance. he might be thinking, look, the justification of Nvidia selling chips to increase the American tech stack is not a good enough justification for America giving out our technology.</p>

### 特朗普最新对华言论提振市场

今天早上，特朗普也谈到了中国以及他对即将到来的谈判的想法。

> **主持人：** 我想知道中国现在在想什么。习近平是否就和平协议的成功向你表示祝贺？
>
> **特朗普：** 嗯，我听说他祝贺了。我们和中国的关系一直很好，但他们总想占便宜。我们会看看和中国会发生什么。我们几周后将在韩国会面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here was Trump this morning about China and what he's thinking going into this negotiation. >> I'm wondering what China is thinking right now. Did Xi Jinping congratulate you about the success of the peace deal? >> Well, I heard he did. There was a statement put out, but >> a meeting with him, >> He did. and I raised our tariffs to 100% uh on top of what they're already paying, which is far worse. Far worse. We'll see what happens with China. I've always had a great relationship with them, as you know, but uh they're always looking for an edge. We're going to meet in a couple of weeks. We're going to meet in South Korea actually with President Xi and other people too.</p>
</details>

在空军一号上，特朗普对记者发表了更多评论，这些评论让市场情绪为之一振。

> **特朗普：** 我们可以降低中国需要支付的关税，但他们也必须为我们做些事。这不再是单行道了。我希望中国购买大豆，停止芬太尼流入。我不想他们和我们玩稀土游戏。我相信我们能达成大豆协议，否则我就不谈了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We can lower what China has to pay in tariffs, but China has to do things for us, too. It's no longer a one-way street. >> China, Mr. President, on soybeans. Are you confident that you'll be able to >> have to buy soybeans? One of the things I want is China's going to buy soybeans. I want China to stop with the fentinol. We very, you know, normal things. I don't want them to play the rare earth game with us. >> But you want them to. But do you think they will make a deal on soybeans? >> I do believe. Yeah. Because otherwise I'm not going to make a deal. No, I want them to buy.</p>
</details>

这些言论，尤其是关于大豆和降低关税的可能性，让市场感到乐观。标普500指数期货应声上涨，英伟达、特斯拉、Palantir等股票也随之上扬。

<p class="english-text">Okay. The soybeans took away uh Wednesday's green close from us and they're giving us a Sunday overnight green overnight market open green as uh as Trump gets friendly on the soybeans. Look at that. S&P 66530. Nvidia's up, Tesla's up, pounders up, hoodie's up.</p>

### 特斯拉财报前瞻

本周三我们将迎来特斯拉的财报。今年到目前为止，特斯拉的股价表现一直滞后，直到上个月才有所起色，目前年内仅上涨15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we've got earnings coming up on Wednesday. Tesla's stock year to date was lagging heavily until the past month. It is now only up 15% year-to- date.</p>
</details>

我个人对特斯拉的看法是，我终于将我的**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 即全自动驾驶，特斯拉开发的先进驾驶辅助系统）更新到了13.2.9版本，虽然还不是14，但我必须说，一直困扰我的“唠叨”提示问题改善了很多。现在我可以瞥一眼手机或者看看窗外的风景，而不会立即收到要求集中注意力的警告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, I finally updated to 13.2.9 on FSD, um, which is not 14, but I don't have 14 available yet. Hopefully, I get FSD 14 soon. I will say, uh, the nagging, which has been my biggest gripe with FSD for the past couple of weeks, really past couple months, quite frankly, is starting to get way better. And now I actually pick up my phone, I can check a text message, I can change the song when I'm looking at music or I can look outside if there's some scenery and when I, you know, look back at the road, I don't have this massive warning telling me to pay attention. It's gotten a lot better.</p>
</details>

但这会影响财报吗？可能不会。真正影响财报的是交付量。他们交付了约50万辆车，好于预期，但我认为这已经计入市场预期。华尔街预计本季度盈利将再次出现同比负增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now does that actually affect the earnings? Probably not because you know FSD is not something that they're selling like hotcakes yet. Uh I think what's going to affect the earnings is the is the delivery. So they delivered basically 500,000 cars, 497,000 um and that was better than expected. The problem is I think everyone has already baked those into their estimates. So the street for this earnings is expecting negative growth year-over-year again.</p>
</details>

我不确定埃隆·马斯克能说些什么来真正推动股价。薪酬方案即将投票并可能通过，他自己购买了10亿美元的股票，以及强劲的交付数据——我认为这三件事都已经反映在股价中，帮助特斯拉从330美元的水平回升到400美元区间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just don't know if anything Elon can say will be enough to actually get this to move. The fact that the compensation package is going to be voted on and likely go in Elon's favor. The fact that he bought a billion dollars worth of stock. I mean, I think those two things and then the fact that they had 497,000 deliveries because of the EV credit going away and so they really took advantage of that. I think all three of those things are priced in and it really helped Tesla get from 330 where it was stuck at now into the 400s.</p>
</details>

特斯拉公司在周三能做些什么来让股价飙升呢？我没有很高的期望。马斯克上个季度就说过，在2026年底之前不要指望有太大的增长。能源业务会不错，但对底线利润贡献不大。除非他们能宣布一份像沃尔玛准备购买10万台Optimus机器人那样的意向书，否则很难看到大的催化剂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What can Tesla the company do on Wednesday that will actually get the stock to blast into the I don't know 470s 480s? I don't have high expectations because I don't I really don't and I don't know if I should but just using Elon's words from last quarter he said don't expect a ton of growth until the end of 2026. Energy is going to be good, but energy doesn't lead to the bottom line significantly. a letter of an intent with a Walmart that is ready to buy 100,000 Optimus. Just even the announcement of a Walmart or a Marta Libre or any of these major companies in their factories are ready to to to you know buy hundreds of thousands of optimism.</p>

### 市场内部观察：创纪录的杠杆与机构动向

让我们看看一些其他的宏观数据。杠杆ETF的数量达到了历史新高，而且5倍杠杆的ETF也即将问世。更重要的是，美国的保证金债务达到了1.13万亿美元，创下历史新高，超过了2021年的9000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh leveraged ETFs. We talked about this last week. Leverage ETFs continue to grow massively. Uh we are at an all-time high on the number of leveraged equity ETFs that are out there. So, US margin debt has hit 1.13 trillion, which is a new all-time high. In 2021, it was 900 billion. So, we are well above the 2021 highs of margin debt.</p>
</details>

这为什么重要？如果市场开始下跌，追加保证金的通知会导致人们被迫出售股票以弥补保证金，从而引发更多的抛售。历史上，每次保证金债务达到高点时，市场都会见顶。但这次我们需要有新的思考，因为与2021年不同，这次的技术前景（AI）比Web 3.0要坚实得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, why does this matter? Well, if things start going down and people get margin called, they will have to sell equities to cover their margin and that creates an onslaught of more selling. Every time we've had historical margin highs, as you can see on the chart, it was a top. Now, do we need to have a cataclysmic crash because margin is higher this time? I don't necessarily think so. At the end of the day, we've already covered a lot of the nuances between this market in 2021. I think two weeks ago, I went on an entire rant about 2021's promise of technology. It was web 3.0. 0 which was absolute garbage compared to AI.</p>
</details>

与此同时，美国银行的数据显示，上周投资者对科技股的资金流入量是最大的。这表明市场逢低买入的意愿非常强烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">take a look at what Bank of America showed, investors had their largest inflow last week in technology stocks last week. So I mean look at the end of the day it does not seem like the market wants to stop buying Nvidia and Amazon and Palunteer and Tesla and all these phenomenal companies.</p>
</details>

此外，机构基金经理的现金水平降至历史最低点，仅为3.8%。正如Tom Lee上周五所说，78%的基金经理尚未达到他们的业绩基准，这意味着他们将不得不追逐市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take a look at institutional fund manager cash levels. So this is not just retail that's buying the dip. It is not just retail that's plowing in money. It is at the lowest level in history. 3.8%. 3.8%. 8% on cash. I think the reason for this is what Tomley said yesterday or on Friday, which is 22% of fund managers have yet to have only met their benchmark. Aka there's uh 78% of fund managers have not met their benchmark. They're going to have to chase.</p>
</details>

美联储即将放松政策，AI的资本支出是顺风，盈利增长预计将达到两位数，还有7.3万亿美元的资金在场外等待。所有这些因素都指向一个看涨的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you got the Fed easing, you've got the AI capex tailwind, you've got earnings growth, which is supposed to be, you know, double digits, which would be phenomenal. Still 7.3 trillion on the sidelines. and then you have fund managers that are ready to to probably buy the dip. I don't know. It feels feels bullish.</p>
</details>

### 总结

总结一下隔夜市场的情况：特朗普就中美关系释放了非常积极的信号，暗示不会发生大规模关税战，这利好市场。**日经指数**（Nikkei: 日本东京证券交易所的主要股票市场指数）大涨，可能是受美国市场对中国评论的积极反应带动。黄仁勋宣布了在美国制造Blackwell芯片晶圆的重大消息，强化了美国制造业回归的叙事。从宏观数据看，杠杆率高，保证金债务高，机构现金配置低，期权交易量持续走高。所有这些因素的最终走向，将取决于本周的财报，尤其是特斯拉和Netflix的表现。如果财报强劲，那么标普500指数的估值就有望在年底前继续维持和扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, cool. So the summary for the overnight markets are as follows. Trump signaling really good stuff with China in regards to not getting into a massive tariff war. That's bullish. The Nikkay likely up because the US is up based on these China comments. Jensen did a big interview uh first wafer for the blackwell chip was created in the United States over the weekend was the announcement. Markets really like that that is official and American manufacturing is coming back. And then in terms of the macro stats, leverage is high, margin debt is high, cash allocation is low institutionally and option volumes continue to go higher. All of those things will either be bullish or bearish based on earnings. And this week we get Tesla and Netflix. We had a bunch of other companies, but Tesla and Netflix are the most important ones. And then the week after that is really when we have our Super Bowl. And if those companies can execute, then I think this multiple for the S&P can continue to sustain itself and expand towards the end of the year. If the earnings growth is really there, we just have to see if that growth can be there.</p>
