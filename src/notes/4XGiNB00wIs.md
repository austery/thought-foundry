### 播客开场与《文化地图》的灵感来源

主持人: 大家好，欢迎收听我们的播客《In Good Company》。今天我们邀请到一位特别嘉宾，艾琳·迈耶（Erin Meyer），她是全球领先的跨文化管理专家之一，也是我最喜欢的书之一《文化地图》（The Culture Map）的作者。艾琳，是什么启发您写这本书的呢？

<details>

<p class="english-text">hi everybody and welcome to our podcast in good company now today we have a special guest with us aren mayor who is one of the world's leading Specialists on crosscultural management and a good thing she's written one of my favorite books called culture map so arene um what inspire you to to write this book</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 嗨，很高兴今天能和大家在一起。我是在明尼苏达州长大的，那里有很多挪威人，位于美国中西部，那是一个非常单一文化的（monocultural）环境。我身边的人都只生活在与我相同的文化中。大学毕业后，我搬到博茨瓦纳（Botswana），在非洲南部教书。我发现我在美国学到的所有激励孩子、营造良好课堂环境的方法完全行不通。他们在课堂上鼓励我做的事情与我们在美国会做的任何事情都截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah hey so nice to be here with you today um well so I was raised in Minnesota there's a lot of Norwegians in Minnesota you might know which is in the Midwest of the US and as a so it was a very monocultural environment I was really surrounded by people who had only lived in the same culture as me uh and then as a after graduating from University I moved to Botswana to Southern Africa and I was teaching school there and I just saw how all of the techniques that I had learned in the US for how to motivate children and how to create a good classroom environment uh were totally falling flat and the things that they were encouraging me to do in the classroom were so different than anything we would ever do in the US</p>
</details>

因此，从那时起，我开始对不同文化如何不仅以不同方式激励孩子，而且在成年后如何以不同方式激励员工，以及我们在沟通和建立信任方面拥有完全不同的心理学，从而实现有效交流产生了浓厚兴趣。这是我研究不同文化如何在国际环境中互动这一旅程的第一步，这也是我现在所做的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I became very interested in that time to just see how in different cultures we um not only that we motivate children differently but that we motivate later on in life our employees differently and that we have a whole different psychology about how to communicate and how to build trust and be effective uh so that was the first step on this journey uh for starting to study how different cultures interact in an international environment which is what I do now yeah great great</p>
</details>

### 文化地图：沟通的维度——高语境与低语境

主持人: 太棒了。您将文化分成了八个不同的维度。如果您不介意，我很想和您聊聊其中一些维度，因为我觉得它们非常有趣。这真的让我思考我们如何管理我们的基金，尤其是在我们身处多个不同国家时。我们有挪威、伦敦、纽约、新加坡的办公室，但我们却倾向于将其视为一种文化，当然事实并非如此。您首先谈到了沟通，并区分了**低语境沟通文化**（low context communication cultures: 沟通时信息明确、直接）和**高语境沟通文化**（high context communication cultures: 沟通时信息隐含、间接）。这代表着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so um you um have kind of split culture into eight different dimensions and if you don't mind I'd just love to talk through some of them because I think it's so interesting and me it really it really made me think about how we run you know our fund uh when we are in in several different countries you know we are in in Norway London we in New York Singapore yet we kind of treat it as as as one culture and of course it isn't but you you kick off with communication and you uh have this differential between low and high context communication cultures what does that mean</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 好的，也许我先花点时间解释一下这个框架，然后再深入探讨低语境和高语境。我有一套方法论，将文化分解为八个行为维度。我们研究不同文化中人们如何以不同方式建立信任，或者世界不同地区的人们如何以不同方式做出决策。通过我们在大约62个国家进行的约18万次访谈，我们将这些国家定位在这些维度上，以便比较不同文化之间的异同，并思考如何更具战略性和同理心。当然，您刚刚强调的是我最喜欢的维度之一，也是我写作和演讲最多的话题，它探讨了在世界不同地区，成为一个好的沟通者意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so maybe I'll just take a moment to explain the framework and then I'll jump into low and high so I have a methodology that breaks culture down into eight behavioral scales so we look at things like how do we build trust differently in different cultures or how do we make decisions differently in different parts of the world and then through about 180,000 interviews that we've conducted in about 62 countries we have these countries that are positioned up and down the scale so you can compare one culture to another in order to think about um both the similarities and differences and how to be more strategic and empathic and of course you've just highlighted one of my favorite Dimensions it's the the one I write and speak about the most which is one that looks at what it means to be a good communicator in different parts of the world and what we have what we call low context cultures</p>
</details>

在**低语境文化**中，我们被训练以非常明确的方式进行沟通。美国可能是世界上最**低语境**或最明确的文化。我从小就被教导要“告诉他们你要告诉他们的，然后告诉他们，然后再告诉他们你已经告诉他们的”。这非常强调把事情说清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">these are cultures where we're really trained to be very explicit in the way that we communicate so the US which is maybe the most uh low context or explicit culture in the world and I was like taught as a child uh to tell them what I'm going to tell them and then tell them and then tell them what I've told them it's the very Focus strong focus on like spelling things out</p>
</details>

而我在世界其他地方生活时学到的是，比如在法国，很多其他文化中，一个好的沟通者往往会在字里行间传递更多信息，捕捉很多未言明的讯息。因此，沟通的复杂性要高得多。举个例子，在法语中我们有一个词，意思是“不要听我说了什么，要听我想要表达什么”。在英语中我们甚至没有这样的词。所以我认为这个维度非常有助于我们开始思考，有效的沟通在世界不同地区是多么不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what I've learned living in other parts of the world I live in France currently I've lived in France for the last uh 23 years uh is that in many other cultures like France for example there's a lot more like a good communicator is really passing a lot more information between the lines and picking up a lot of unspoken messages so the sophistic uh the sophistication of the of the communication is much higher and I mean an example of that would be just even in the French language like uh we have this word in French means don't listen to what I said listen to what I meant right we don't even have these words in English uh so I think this is a great Dimension to help us start thinking about how effective communication is so different from one part of the world to another</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，当我去纽约时，我应该如何以不同的方式沟通？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so when I go to uh New York how should I communicate differently</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 我认为在纽约，作为一个移民城市，你会有来自世界各地的人们在美国文化的伞下共同生活。在这样一个高度多元化的文化中，我们学会了必须把事情说清楚。如果你不说出来，那就是没有沟通。我给你一个我上周刚遇到的新例子。我班上有一个来自意大利的学生对我说：“艾琳，在意大利，如果你讲个笑话，如果对方觉得好笑，他们会笑。但在美国，如果你讲个笑话，如果对方觉得好笑，他们会说‘那真好笑’。”我以前从未想过这一点！为什么没有人对我的笑话说过“那真好笑”？这都是在字里行间进行的，对吧？所以，无论如何，在与那位意大利学生交流后，我从未想过这一点。我说：“哦，是的，你说得对，我们既会笑，也会说‘那真好笑’。”他说：“不，艾琳，我一直在美国观察，笑声是可有可无的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I think I mean in New York which is of course a place of immigration right like when you go to New York you've got people from all over the world who are now living together Under the Umbrella of the American culture and in that highly diverse culture we've learned that we really have to spell things out so if you don't say it it was uncommunicated and maybe I'll just give like a brand new example that I have just from last a week but um like I had this this person from Italy in my class who said to me you know Erin in Italy like if you make a joke and the other person thinks it's funny they laugh but in the US if you make a joke and the other person thinks it's funny they say that's funny and I like I had never thought about this why do nobody ever say that about my jokes I it's all it's all between the lines right um so in any case I mean at the end of that that situation with the with the uh the Italian was I never thought about this so I said oh yeah you're right we we laugh and we say that's funny and he said no Erin I've been observing this a lot in the US the the laughter is optional</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为世界正在朝着更像美国式的沟通方式发展吗？更多的点睛之笔，更短的句子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do you think the world is moving towards a more American communication style more punchlines shorter sentences</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 我确实认为我们的沟通变得更短了，这与越来越虚拟化的环境有关。但我想给您举个例子。大约12个月前，我在日本做了一场演讲。演讲结束后，我问有没有问题，没有人举手。我坐了下来，我的一位日本同事走过来对我说：“艾琳，我想可能有一些问题，您想让我试试吗？”我说：“好的，请便。”于是他站到那群日本人面前，说：“迈耶教授刚刚和大家交流了，大家有什么问题吗？”还是没有人举手。但他停了下来，安静地环顾四周，几秒钟的沉默后，他向一个在我看来一动不动的人示意，说：“您有问题吗？”这位日本人坐直了身子，说：“非常感谢，我确实有一个。”他提出了一个引人入胜的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I mean I do believe that we have to be that we're we've become perhaps shorter in our communication which happens with being more and more virtual but I want to give you an example so I had an example just a couple of of well maybe 12 months ago where I was giving a presentation in Japan and at the end of the presentation I asked if there were any questions no one raised their hand I went to sit down so one of my colleagues this Japanese guy who was traveling with me he came up to me and he said Erin I think there were some questions uh would you like me to try and I said yes please so he stood up in front of this group of Japanese and he said you know uh Professor Meyer has just spoken with you do you have any questions no one raised their hand uh but he he stopped and he he quietly looked around the room and then after several seconds of Silence he gestured to someone who was sitting there from my perspective motionless and he said you know do you have a question and this Japanese guy sat up straight and he said thank you very much I do he gave a f he asked a fascinating question</p>
</details>

后来我的同事又做了三次同样的事情。之后我问他：“你是怎么知道那些人有问题？”他说：“嗯，这和他们的眼神亮度有关。”我当时想，哇，对于我这个来自明尼苏达州的人来说，这太有挑战性了。但他解释说：“艾琳，在日本，我们不像西方人那样进行很多直接的眼神交流。所以当你问有没有问题时，大多数人并没有直接看着你，他们可能看向别处。但我注意到房间里有几个人确实直接看着你，而且他们的眼神很亮，这表明如果你愿意点他们，他们会很高兴。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so afterwards and then my colleague did that three more times so afterwards I said to him but how did you know that those people had questions he said well um it had to do with how bright Their Eyes Were and I thought wow you know for me coming from Minnesota like I do that's very challenging but then he clarified he said you know Erin in Japan we don't make as much direct eye contact as you do in the west so when you asked if there were any questions most people weren't looking right at you they were kind of looking somewhere else but I noticed that there were a couple of people in the room who really were looking right at you and their eyes were bright you know suggesting they would be happy to have you call on them if you would like to</p>
</details>

这对我来说是一次非常重要的学习经历。你可能会觉得：“哦，好吧，那是日本，日本确实和世界其他地方很不一样。”但我可以告诉你，当我回到**INSEAD**（欧洲工商管理学院: 位于法国枫丹白露的国际商学院）时，我是一名教授，我在那里教这些非常国际化的班级。当我带着这个关于“寻找明亮的眼神”的经验回到INSEAD的课堂上时，我发现有很多人通过面部表情给我这种身体上的暗示，表明他们想发言，而我以前完全没有注意到。因为在美国，如果你想发言，你总是会举手，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was such an important learning experience for me and you might think oh okay well that's Japan Japan is really like different from the rest of the world but I can tell you when I got back to inad right so I'm a professor at inad outside of Paris and I teach these um these like hugely International classrooms and when I got back to inad with this kind of lesson about looking for Bright Eyes in my classes I saw there were all of these people who were giving me this physical indication with their faces that they wanted to speak that I wasn't entirely missing because in the US if you want to speak you always raise your hand right</p>
</details>

主持人: 这种文化敏感度的关键是什么？是必须在一个国家生活并训练，还是人们天生就有更好的“天线”，或者是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the key to this uh cultural sensitivity the key to observe people in this astute way is it do you have to live in a country and train or do people just have better antennas or what is it</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 当然，如果你去另一个国家生活，最终你会真正开始吸收那种文化。你会有那些经历，你会学会更加谦逊，你会学会更加好奇——希望如此，你会学会更加好奇和谦逊。但我认为你不必如此。我的意思是，你不必通过从一个国家搬到另一个国家来投入一生发展这些技能。我确实相信，通过一些系统的理解，思考不同文化在某个方面如何相互关联，你可以变得更有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">of course if you go and you live in another country um eventually you will really start kind of like absorbing that culture in you you have those experiences you learn to be more humble you learn to be more curious hopefully you learn to be more Curious and more humble but I don't think you have to I mean you don't have to devote your life to developing these skills by moving from country to Country I do believe with a little bit of of systematic understanding thinking about you know how do different cultures relate on this aspect that you can become more effective</p>
</details>

### 反馈的艺术：避免误解

艾琳·迈耶: 我可以再给您举个例子吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">can can I give you another example sure</p>
</details>

主持人: 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well like let's just think about feedback I mean feedback is of course like something that we do so differently in different cultures and er this kind of ties in with your with your second dimension right evaluation and feedback yeah that's it right</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 好的，我们来谈谈反馈。反馈在不同文化中当然有很大的不同。这与您的第二个维度有关，对吧？评估和反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so that I mean that is the second dimension the second dimension looks at how we provide feedback in different countries and I think that that one is the most sensitive and in some ways I mean the communicating Dimension is perhaps the most like kind of interesting one but if you want to know if you want to if you want if if you're going to cause offense or you're going to break a relationship it's because of the feedback Dimension</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，没错。这就是第二个维度。第二个维度探讨了我们在不同国家提供反馈的方式。我认为这是最敏感的一个维度。在某些方面，沟通维度可能更有趣，但如果你想知道你是否会冒犯别人或破坏关系，那往往是因为反馈维度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and maybe I'll just give you an example so um of course as I already said I come from the US and in the US we think of ourselves as being a very direct culture because we're so low context because we're so explicit and we spell things out but we actually have this tendency in the US I I learned as a child to when I give feedback to give three positives with every negative or to catch people doing things right</p>
</details>

我来举个例子。当然，正如我之前所说，我来自美国。在美国，我们认为自己是一个非常直接的文化，因为我们是如此**低语境**，如此明确，我们会把事情说清楚。但实际上，在美国我们有一种倾向，我从小就学会了，在给出反馈时，每说一个负面意见，都要附带三个正面意见，或者说要“抓住人们做对的事情”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and like if you're from Norway where maybe you've learned that you know you if you have something that well I think in Norway often you don't give the positive feedback the positive feedback may be just kind of assumed so then you're giving me feedback and you start by telling me you know what you think I I could do differently I may really take that as a sign of of disrespect right</p>
</details>

如果你来自挪威，你可能学到的是，如果你有什么意见，在挪威通常不会给出积极的反馈，积极的反馈可能被认为是理所当然的。所以当你给我反馈时，你直接告诉我你认为我哪里可以做得不同，我可能会真的认为那是一种不尊重的表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then in the other way it gets really confusing so so okay you know I live in France and I was working and in France positive feedback is giv a lot less frequently than in the US and negative or corrective feedback is definitely giving more strongly than in an American context</p>
</details>

反过来，这会变得非常令人困惑。我在法国生活和工作，在法国，积极的反馈比美国少得多，而负面或纠正性反馈则比美国语境中更强烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I'm working with this French woman oh here's someone from the from the book the book this woman Sabine right and she's um she's uh really excited about this move that she's making to Chicago so we spend a little time she's she's all energized then she moves to the US and after she's been in Chicago for four months I do a prescheduled follow-up call and before I call her I call her new boss this this American named John and I just say to John you know how are things going for Sabine and he says you know eron not well it's so frustrating because I've spoken with Sabine a bunch of times about these things she really needs to change if she's going to be successful and she hasn't made any effort to make these changes I I had my performance review with Sabine last week still no effort</p>
</details>

我正在和一位法国女性合作，她在我的书里出现过，名叫萨宾（Sabine）。她对搬到芝加哥感到非常兴奋。我们花了一些时间交流，她充满活力。然后她搬到了美国，在芝加哥待了四个月后，我打了一个预定的跟进电话。在给她打电话之前，我先给她的新老板，一位名叫约翰（John）的美国人打了电话。我问约翰：“萨宾的情况怎么样？”他说：“艾琳，情况不太好。这太令人沮丧了，因为我已经和萨宾谈过好几次她需要改变才能成功的事情，但她没有任何努力去做出这些改变。我上周和萨宾进行了绩效评估，她仍然没有做出任何努力。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so then I call Sabine how are things going in the US and she says you know Erin they're going great you know I just had this fabulous feedback from my boss it was the best performance review I've ever received so of course when her American boss starts his feedback at his performance review by saying you know this was really this was really fantastic and this part was really thought out and I really think you're making a huge impact here she's thinking wow that's the best performance review you know anyone has ever given me and by the time he gets to the real message she isn't even listening anymore</p>
</details>

然后我给萨宾打电话，问她在美国的情况如何。她说：“艾琳，一切都很好！我刚刚从老板那里得到了非常棒的反馈，那是我收到过的最好的绩效评估。”所以，当她的美国老板在绩效评估中开始反馈时，他说：“你知道，这真的很棒，这部分考虑得很周全，我真的认为你在这里产生了巨大的影响。”萨宾心想：“哇，这是我收到过的最好的绩效评估。”等到他讲到真正的意见时，她已经完全听不进去了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what do you think is the best way of doing it what's the best way to give you back</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为最好的方式是什么？给出反馈的最佳方式是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I do believe you asked me earlier whether you should adapt your style to the culture that you're working with I mean I do think when it comes to feedback of course it's important to to get the message out there but if you give the message in a way that's too direct for the culture that you're working with you may break the relationship and that's not going to be good for your future and if you give if you give the feedback in a way that's too indirect for the culture that you're working with then they won't pick up the message and you may find that you need to come back and be clearer the next time it's just so difficult to give to give and receive feedback right and it's so easy to defend people to offend people and it's so easy to be offended</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 我确实认为，您之前问我是否应该根据您所合作的文化来调整您的风格。我的意思是，我认为在反馈方面，当然重要的是把信息传达出去。但如果你以一种对于你所合作的文化来说过于直接的方式传达信息，你可能会破坏关系，这对你的未来不利。而如果你以一种对于你所合作的文化来说过于间接的方式传达反馈，那么他们就不会接收到信息，你可能会发现下次需要更清楚地表达。给出和接收反馈真的很难，对吧？冒犯别人很容易，被冒犯也很容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I've um uh you know of course uh read your book and one of the things you recommend is to give uh you know positive and a negative uh straight after the the action so I tried this today I gave a presentation together with two of my colleagues straight after the presentation I said hey you know what let's give each other one one positive and one thing we need to improve and it was just great you know really low stress felt really natural and easy to take aboard</p>
</details>

主持人: 我当然读过您的书，您推荐的一种方法是在行动之后立即给出积极和消极的反馈。我今天就试了一下。我和两位同事一起做完演示后，我立刻说：“嘿，我们互相给一个积极的反馈和一件需要改进的事情吧。”结果非常棒，压力很小，感觉很自然，也很容易接受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah thank you so that's actually you're now pulling from my other book right from my no rules rules book where we have a chapter on giving feedback in an organization and how to create an organizational culture around this</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，谢谢。您现在实际上是在引用我的另一本书，我的《不拘一格》（No Rules Rules）一书，其中有一章专门讨论如何在组织中提供反馈以及如何围绕此建立组织文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I think the message is that if you're working with people outside of your own company or your own team I mean really we want to just try to watch how other people are doing it um try to be a little bit less Direct in general because we don't want to risk uh um we don't want to risk breaking the Rel relationship um and then gradually kind of ease in to being a little bit more direct but you made you made a framework of um of four uh rules what what are they they all happen to start with an A</p>
</details>

所以我想传达的信息是，如果你与公司或团队以外的人合作，我们真的应该尝试观察其他人是如何做的，通常要稍微不那么直接，因为我们不想冒着破坏关系的风险，然后逐渐变得更直接一些。但是您建立了一个由四条规则组成的框架，它们都以字母“A”开头，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay okay yeah those are my Four A's I do believe it's really a really good strategy to say okay in this company this is how we will give feedback which is of course gives us a common platform for how we work with one another</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 好的，是的，那是我的**反馈四A原则**（Four A's of Feedback: 旨在提供建设性反馈并促进组织内部开放沟通的框架）。我确实认为这是一种非常好的策略，可以说：“好的，在这家公司，我们将这样提供反馈。”这当然为我们彼此合作提供了一个共同的平台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the four a of feedback which you may Implement throughout your organiz ation are number one when you give feedback you need to aim to uh aim let me freaking remember you need need to aim to help aim to assist right so that's of course the first one meaning that I don't give feedback just because I'm frustrated or I'm angry or I need to get get get something off my chest if that's how you're feeling don't give the feedback at all but if I see oh gosh you know I think that Nikolai could be a better interviewer or if he did X Y or Z and I have an idea for how that could help help you well in that case I have feedback that I could give you with the aim to to help you with the aim to assist that's your first a</p>
</details>

您可以在整个组织中实施的反馈四A原则是：
1.  **旨在帮助（Aim to Assist）**：当你提供反馈时，你的目标必须是帮助，旨在协助。这意味着我不会仅仅因为沮丧、生气或需要发泄而提供反馈。如果你有这种感觉，就根本不要提供反馈。但如果我看到，天哪，我认为尼古拉可以成为一个更好的采访者，或者如果他做了X、Y或Z，并且我有一个可以帮助你的想法，那么在这种情况下，我可以给你反馈，目的是帮助你，目的是协助你。这是你的第一个A。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the second a is the feedback must be actionable and that's of course critical because if I have feedback for you but there isn't anything you could do about it I mean keep it to yourself then he kind of a personal attack you know yeah I mean then again I think we come back to like what's even the point What's even the point of giving the feedback if the person can't act on it so those are the two ways of giving feedback</p>
</details>

2.  **可操作的（Actionable）**：第二个A是反馈必须是可操作的。这当然至关重要，因为如果我给你的反馈没有任何你可以做的事情，我的意思是，那就留给自己吧。那有点像人身攻击。我的意思是，我们又回到了“那有什么意义？”如果这个人无法根据反馈采取行动，那么给出反馈的意义何在？所以这是给出反馈的两种方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then the two ways of receiving feedback are number one show appreciation so even if you doesn't feel good to receive that even if you disagree with the person don't defend yourself just say you know what I thank you very much thank you for having given me that feedback I'm going to think about it</p>
</details>

然后接收反馈的两种方式是：
3.  **表达感谢（Show Appreciation）**：第一，表达感谢。即使收到反馈感觉不好，即使你不同意对方的意见，也不要为自己辩护，只需说：“非常感谢，谢谢你给我这个反馈，我会好好考虑的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if you really get a feedback a culture of feedback going in your organization if you manage to get your employees giving a lot of feedback to one another which can be hugely beneficial for the organization you're going to need a fourth a also and that fourth a is that each person can accept or decline whatever feedback is given to them I don't mean that I say explicitly thank you but I decline your feedback I mean that I um I think about the feedback you give me and then I decide what I'm going to take and what I'm not going to take and we all know that that's part of a principle of culture of of uh developing a culture of feedback</p>
</details>

4.  **接受或拒绝（Accept or Decline）**：但如果你真的在你的组织中建立起一种反馈文化，如果你能让你的员工互相提供大量反馈，这可能对组织非常有益，那么你还需要第四个A。这第四个A是每个人都可以接受或拒绝他们收到的任何反馈。我不是说我明确地说“谢谢，但我拒绝你的反馈”，我的意思是，我会思考你给我的反馈，然后决定我将采纳什么，不采纳什么。我们都知道这是发展反馈文化的一个原则。

<p class="english-text">so then that brings me to what you've said earlier and I think that in that case if you get that culture of feedback going we can really do what you suggested uh Nikolai which is that at the end of a meeting we can say hey let's just sit down and give one another a little bit of feedback so that we can be more successful the next time one one thing I think you're doing you did well one thing I think that you could do to up your performance next time you give me one thing you think I did well one thing you think that I could do to up my performance next time and in doing so all that feedback starts to get out there</p>
</details>

所以这让我回到了您之前所说的，我认为在这种情况下，如果我们建立起这种反馈文化，我们就可以真正做到您建议的，尼古拉，那就是在会议结束时，我们可以说：“嘿，我们坐下来互相给一些反馈，这样我们下次就能更成功。”你给我一个你认为我做得好的地方，一个你认为我下次可以改进的地方，我也会给你一个你认为我做得好的地方，一个你认为我下次可以改进的地方。通过这样做，所有的反馈就开始流通起来。

<p class="english-text">I guess the advantage of doing it straight after a meeting is that you can be pretty quick and it works it's a bit like when you respond to an email if you're really quick it can be one sentence if you take a little time it needs to be much longer so I guess you save some time time as well</p>
</details>

主持人: 我想会议结束后立刻进行反馈的优点是你可以非常迅速，而且它很有效。这有点像你回复邮件，如果你很快，可能只需要一句话，如果你花一点时间，就需要长得多。所以我想你也可以节省一些时间。

<p class="english-text">but just moving on here um so another dimension you talk about is trust what's the how do you build trust in different cultures what's the what's the key here</p>
</details>

### 建立信任：认知信任与情感信任

主持人: 好的，我们继续。您谈到的另一个维度是信任。在不同文化中如何建立信任？这里的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I think that that's actually the the the most foundational of all of the dimensions so of course in every country in the world we have to have trust in order to get work done I mean that's culturally Universal but when it comes to how we feel trust for someone that's quite different from one country to another and we can just keep it simple there's two kinds of trust so there's cognitive trust that's like trust from my brain that's like I see you you are on time you do good work you're reliable I trust you</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，我认为这实际上是所有维度中最基础的一个。当然，在世界上每个国家，我们都必须有信任才能完成工作，这是文化普遍性的。但当我们谈到如何信任一个人时，这在不同国家之间是截然不同的。我们可以简单地分为两种信任：
1.  **认知信任**（cognitive trust: 基于对方能力、可靠性和表现的信任）：这就像来自我大脑的信任，比如我看到你准时，你工作做得好，你很可靠，所以我信任你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then we have what we call effective trust that's like trust from my heart right that's like I feel an emotional connection or a personal bond with you I feel like I've seen who you are at a at a beyond your professional Persona and because I've seen who you are inside I trust you</p>
</details>

2.  **情感信任**（affective trust: 基于情感联结和个人关系的信任）：然后我们有所谓的**情感信任**，这就像来自我内心的信任。这就像我与你有一种情感联系或个人纽带，我觉得我看到了你超越职业形象的真实自我，因为我看到了你内心深处的样子，所以我信任你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now if I ask you why you trust your mother it doesn't matter where you come from we'll talk in every country we'll talk about effective Trust but if I ask you why you trust a business partner we'll see a lot more difference from one part of the world to another</p>
</details>

现在，如果我问你为什么信任你的母亲，无论你来自哪里，我们都会谈论**情感信任**。但如果我问你为什么信任一个商业伙伴，我们就会看到世界不同地区之间存在很大的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean some cultures like like my actually both of our cultures right both the US and and Norway which are both quite task oriented cultures so in these cultures we really try to separate like cognitive trust for work and effective trust for home</p>
</details>

我的意思是，有些文化，比如我和您的文化，美国和挪威，都是非常**任务导向型文化**（task-oriented cultures: 强调效率、目标和结果）。在这些文化中，我们真的试图将工作中的**认知信任**与家庭中的**情感信任**分开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then in many other world cultures for example every Emerging Market country in the world just to get us started we can really see that kind of cognitive and effective trust all woven together in a work environment so the importance of whining and dining is is bigger uh yeah I mean yes clearly but I think that we could take it to a a different level by saying the the the goal in a task oriented Society is to be friendly and enjoy working together but to really minimize well minimize distractions in order to stay focused on getting as much done as we can in a short period of Time Versus in a relationship oriented culture we really want our initial goal to be to do whatever we can virtually if necessary or if we can go there yeah I mean whining and dining definitely but really exposing who we are inside laughing together um spending time developing some kind of a friendship together and then if we start like that we'll find that the rest of the work will kind of all fall into place at a later you know as after we get that in place</p>
</details>

而在许多其他世界文化中，例如世界上每一个新兴市场国家，我们可以看到**认知信任**和**情感信任**在工作环境中是交织在一起的。所以，宴请的重要性更大。是的，当然。但我认为我们可以将其提升到另一个层面，即在**任务导向型社会**中，目标是友好相处并享受合作，但要尽量减少干扰，以便在短时间内尽可能多地完成工作。而在**关系导向型文化**（relationship-oriented culture: 强调人际关系、情感联结和长期合作）中，我们的首要目标是，如果必要，尽可能多地进行虚拟交流，或者如果可以的话，亲自前往。是的，宴请当然重要，但更重要的是展现真实的自我，一起欢笑，花时间建立某种友谊。如果我们这样开始，我们会发现一旦建立了这种关系，其余的工作都会水到渠成。

### 领导力与权力距离

主持人: 那么，这对领导力有什么影响呢？特别是**平等主义社会**（egalitarian society: 强调平等、低层级和共享决策）与等级森严的国家之间的差异。例如，挪威是一个完全扁平化的社会，等级制度很少，事情被锚定在左右中心，以便每个人都参与决策。而其他国家则不同。那么，您如何看待这些不同的情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now um what are the implications for uh leadership so uh in particular the difference between an egalitarian society and a and a country with more hierarchy so you know Norway totally flat uh you know uh Society uh very little hierarchy things are anchored left right and Center uh so that everybody participates in the decision- making uh versus other countries where that's different so you know how do you how do you look at these different things</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，我认为领导力维度是一个非常有趣的维度，因为确实，您来自世界上最**平等主义**的文化之一。在您的挪威文化中，有一种非常强烈的信念，认为最好的老板几乎就像是平等者之间的协调者。我们喜欢我们的老板看起来像其他人一样，我们希望我们的老板不是告诉我们该做什么，而是充当讨论的协调者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I think that leading scale is quite an interesting one because it's true like you come from one of the most egalitarian cultures in the world right so in your culture in Norway there's this very like I think strong belief that the best boss is almost like a facilitator among equals so we like our boss to like look like everybody else and we want our boss um instead of telling us what to do we want our boss to be their kind of like facilitating discussion</p>
</details>

当然，在更——我们称之为**等级制**（hierarchical）的文化中，但我对“等级制”这个词有些犹豫。我称之为**低权力距离**（low power distance: 权力分配更平等，下属可以挑战权威）与**高权力距离**（high power distance: 权力分配不平等，下属尊重并服从权威）。因为我知道在您和我的国家，挪威和美国，我们认为“等级制”是一个负面词汇。但如果您考虑**权力距离**这个概念，挪威是一个非常**低权力距离**的文化，对我们所合作的人的地位表现出非常低的尊重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then of course in more well we'll call it hierarchical but I hesitate with hierarchical the word I call it low power distance versus high power distance because I know like in in your and my country Norway and the us we we think of the word hierarchy as something negative but if you think about this idea of power distance so Norway a very low power distance culture um very low um low respect shown to the the status of the person that we're working with</p>
</details>

相比之下，在**高权力距离文化**中，例如印度或中国，您在新加坡工作，显然是**高权力距离文化**，人们从小就学会对他们所服务的人的职位表现出更多的尊重。作为老板，这会变得非常复杂，因为这意味着我们必须真正知道如何调整我们的领导风格，以适应我们所合作的文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">versus in a higher power distance culture maybe we're in India or maybe we're in China um well you work in Singapore clearly uh higher power distance culture where people really learn from a young age to show a lot more respect for the position of the person that they're working for and then this gets I think really complicated as a boss because it means we have to really know how to kind of adapt our leadership style to the position that to the the culture that we're working with</p>
</details>

### 历史与宗教对文化的影响

主持人: 但这些差异是如何产生的呢？例如，你从丹麦越过边境到德国，差异非常大。法国也大相径庭。这些差异是如何发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but how do how do these differences actually happen so you if you just move from Denmark across the border to Germany right very very different and France very different just how does it how do this it happen</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，我认为这个特定的问题非常有趣。如果我们看看，好吧，我们来谈谈您。我的意思是，在丹麦，您和您的老板直呼其名，对吧？在德国，您会用姓氏，并在前面加上“博士”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah well that specific one I think is very interesting because if we look at okay let's talk about you well I mean in Denmark you Denmark you Denmark on you are on your first name with your boss right in Germany you are you are on on on the surname and you put a doctor in front right</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，这实际上很有趣，因为如果你看一张文化地图，比如我们看丹麦到德国的文化地图，在很多方面，这些文化是相当相似的。在我的文化地图上，它们都很直接地给出负面反馈，德国人稍微更直接一些，但两者都相当直接。这两种文化都相当**任务导向**，在这个维度上没有太大差异。两者都相当**低语境**，尽管丹麦比德国稍微**高语境**一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah well that's actually it's interesting because if you look at a culture map like if we look at a culture map of Denmark up to Germany in many ways those cultures are quite similar right on my on my on my culture map right so like both of them are pretty direct with with with negative feedback Germans a little bit more direct but both of them pretty direct um both of those are rather task oriented societies not very different on that scale but when it comes both of them rather low context although Denmark a little bit more High context than than Germany</p>
</details>

但当涉及到等级制度时，差异就很大了。丹麦在我的研究中是世界上最**平等主义**的国家。我知道在斯堪的纳维亚，你们经常谈论瑞典，也许你们会说瑞典人更**平等主义**，但瑞典人更**共识导向**（consensual: 决策过程强调群体共识）。瑞典人显然比其他斯堪的纳维亚文化更**共识导向**。但丹麦是最**平等主义**的，对权威的尊重最少。当然，与丹麦相比，德国对权威的尊重要强得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but when it comes to hierarchy that's where you've got a big difference so Denmark actually on my mapping in my research is the the most egalitarian country in the world and I know in Scandinavia you talk a lot about Sweden I think maybe you say swedes are more egalitarian but swedes are more consensual right swedes are clearly like a lot more consensual than other Scandinavian cultures but um Dan's the most egalitarian the the least deference to Authority and of course in Germany that deference to Authority is in comparison to Denmark quite a bit stronger</p>
</details>

如果你问我为什么，我来暂时扮演一下教授的角色。如果我们思考欧洲各地导致这些差异的原因，你会发现斯堪的纳维亚的文化，以及整个欧洲，那些受到维京人影响的文化往往是世界上最**平等主义**和**共识导向**的文化。维京人当然是通过共识来领导的。历史上有很多关于南欧人来到斯堪的纳维亚谈判，却不得不提前回家，因为他们搞不清楚谁是负责人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and if you just like you asked me why I don't so I'll get just do my professorial thing for a moment but if we think about um What's led to these differences across Europe you can see like in Scandinavia the cultures well across Europe the cultures that fell under the influence of the Vikings tend to be some of the most egalitarian and consensual cultures in the world and the Vikings of course they led by by consensus so there are all all of these stories about southern Europeans historically coming to Scandinavia to negotiate and having to come home early because they couldn't figure out who was in charge</p>
</details>

然后，当然，那些受到罗马帝国影响的文化往往更具**等级制**。所以你去意大利，你去西班牙，与斯堪的纳维亚相比，那里肯定有更强的**等级制结构**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and then of course the cultures that fell under the influence of the Roman Empire tend to be a little bit more hierarchical so you go to Italy you go to Spain definitely of a a stronger hierarchical structure in comparison to Scandinavia</p>
</details>

然后我认为最有趣的是宗教。因为当新教在17世纪来到欧洲时，它在某种程度上消除了教会的等级制度。所以现在我可以直接与上帝对话，而不是在与上帝对话之前先与牧师、主教、教皇对话。实际上，即使在荷兰，如果你从新教地区搬到天主教地区，你也会看到从超级**平等主义**向稍微不那么**平等主义**的转变。所以，我的意思是，我不会过多谈论历史，但我确实认为思考这些是很有趣的。我猜尼古拉，你早上上班时不会想着维京人或罗马帝国，也许你应该想一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I think the most interesting one is actually religion because the cultures that well when the when the Protestant religion came to Europe in a way in the 1600s in a way it removed the hierarchy from the church so now I talk directly to God instead of talking to the priest the bishop the pope before speaking to God and actually like even in the Netherlands if you move from the Protestant part of the Netherlands to the Catholic part of the Netherlands you can see a movement from a little bit well from a super egalitarian to like slightly less egalitarian As you move to the the Catholic part so I mean I don't talk too much about like history but I do think it is interesting to think about me I imagine Nikolai when you come to work in the morning that you're not thinking about the Vikings or the Roman Empire maybe you maybe you should be though</p>
</details>

主持人: 我当然应该想，但这真的非常非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I clearly should be but it's uh it's really really interesting</p>
</details>

### 全球化下的领导力趋势

主持人: 有没有一种趋势？嗯，前段时间，似乎有一种趋势，整个欧洲都倾向于采用斯堪的纳维亚式的领导风格，对吧？瑞士、英国等非常重要的公司都有来自斯堪的纳维亚的首席执行官或董事长。斯堪的纳维亚式的领导风格仍然是一种趋势吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is there a trend um you know there was a time um a little while back where where there seemed to be a trend towards more Scandinavian leadership styles across Europe certainly right so very important companies in Switzerland uh in the UK and so on had either CEOs or chair uh people from chairpersons from uh you know from scandy was is the still a trend towards the Scandinavian leadership style or not</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，我确实相信在世界上，我们可以通过研究看到，世界上每个国家都在代际上变得更加**平等主义**。所以在印度，年轻一代比老一代更**平等主义**；在韩国，年轻一代比老一代更**平等主义**；甚至在挪威，年轻一代也比老一代更**平等主义**。我认为这实际上是因为互联网的出现。我的意思是，我小时候，我52岁了，那时显然没有互联网，这意味着拥有更多专业知识和经验的人是知识的来源。所以我的老师或父亲告诉我什么，我必须相信他们的经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah so I do believe in the world I mean we not we can see with research that every country in the world is generationally becoming a little bit more egalitarian so in India the younger generation is more egalitarian than the older generation in Korea the younger generation a little more egalitarian than the older generation and even in Norway the younger generation a little more egalitarian than the older generation and I think that's happened actually because of the internet right I mean like when I was a child okay I'm 52 when I was a child clearly there was no internet which means that the people who had more expertise and more experience were the source of knowledge so what my teacher tells me or my father tells me I mean I have to put Faith in what in in that in that experience</p>
</details>

但当然，随着互联网的出现，我们开始了信息的**平等主义**。所以现在年轻人可以在互联网上查阅资料，无论我是在印度、韩国还是挪威，我都可以对老师说：“嘿，但我昨天在互联网上读到的不是这样。”或者对医生说：“嘿，我查过了，我不认为你是对的。”所以我确实相信，这创造了一种“哇，我们都能拥有权力真是太棒了”的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but of course with the internet we started uh let's say an a galarian ISM of information so now the young person can look something up on the internet and whether I'm in India or Korea or Norway I can say to the teacher hey but I that's not what I read on the internet yesterday um or doctor hey I looked it up I don't think you're right so I do believe that that's um that created this kind of notion of wow it's great that we can all have the power</p>
</details>

但当您问到这种倾向于斯堪的纳维亚式领导风格的问题时，我认为很重要的一点是，我们谈论了**平等主义**，但斯堪的纳维亚的另一个重要方面是**共识决策**。在这方面，我想说，人们通常将这两者混为一谈，认为**平等主义**就意味着**共识决策**。我为这两者设置了两个独立的维度。因为在美国，我们相当**平等主义**，尽管比挪威更具等级制度，但老板做决定，老板做决定，对吧？或者至少个人做决定，通常是老板。我们不太喜欢你们在斯堪的纳维亚倾向于做的事情，那就是花很长时间通过群体来做决定，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I want I think it's important when you ask about this um about this kind of leaning towards Scandinavian leadership because we talked about egalitarianism but one of the other big aspects that you have in Scandinavia is this consensual decision making and that's where I would say um I mean people generally lump those two things together like egalitarian means consensual decision-making I have two separate dimensions for those um because like in the us where we are well okay we're rather egalitarian although much more hierarchical than you are in Norway but the boss but the boss decides but the boss decides right or at least the individual decides and usually that's the boss we don't really like this thing that you tend to do in Scandinavia which is like take a long time to make decisions by groups right</p>
</details>

我的意思是，在挪威，甚至在瑞典更是如此，但这种趋势很明显，那就是经过一段时间，我们分享想法，达成某种群体协议，然后一旦我们实施这个想法，我们不会轻易回头，因为它花了我们很长时间才达成。所以在**共识文化**中，决策往往制定缓慢，但一旦制定，就会尽可能地固定下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um so I mean I like okay in Norway and even more so in Sweden but clearly the the tendency is that over a period of time we we share our ideas we come to some kind of group agreement and then once we Implement that that um that idea we don't go back easily because it took us a long time to get to it so and what I what I refer to as consensual cultures decisions tend to be slow to make to be made but then they're definitely as much as possible fixed right</p>
</details>

有趣的是，在挪威，你们是**平等主义**和**共识导向**的。但我们之前谈到的日本，我认为您的听众会知道，是一个非常**等级森严**的社会，对您所合作的人的地位表现出很多尊重。但它也是世界上最**共识导向**的文化，甚至超过瑞典。这意味着决策是由群体缓慢做出的，然后一旦做出，就会固定下来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and interestingly like okay in Norway you are egalitarian and consensual but we talked about Japan earlier I mean Japan is I think your listeners will know a very hierarchical Society okay a lot of deference to the position of the person that you're working with but it's also the most consensual culture in the world which more so than Sweden which means decisions are made Slowly by the group um and then once they are made they are fixed um so so I think it's just uh like what's the let's say what's the most modern approach I mean it depends on what kind of work you're trying to do</p>
</details>

所以我想，最现代的方法是什么？这取决于你正在尝试做什么样的工作。例如，日本人非常擅长汽车制造，对吧？如果你正在开发一个产品，你希望犯错的风险非常小，那么**共识决策**就非常棒。花很长时间做出决定是好事。在那些更像制造业的环境中，**等级制领导方法**也可以非常迅速。但如果我们在一个敏捷的环境中，我们需要创造力，**平等主义**通常会带来整个组织的大量创造力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so like Japanese people they're really good at automobiles right okay well if you are developing a product where you want very little risk of um of a mistake then a consensual decision- making is great it's good to take a really long time to make the decision and in those those like let's say like a more manufacturing environment uh hierarchical um hierarchical leadership methods also can be very fast uh but if we're in an agile environment we need creativity egalitarianism generally leads to a lot of creativity throughout the organization</p>
</details>

主持人: 您见过所有这些不同的公司和文化，现在我们将在艾琳和尼古拉公司（Erin and Nikolai Inc.）成立一家公司。我们希望公司文化是什么样的？完美的文化是什么样的？如果能从每种文化中取一点，那会是什么样的伟大公司？

<p class="english-text">oh okay all right so let's say but they're all but they're all very very clever otherwise they wouldn't have listened to the program they're the smartest people totally totally</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 完全正确。好的，假设您和我在创办一家IT初创公司。我的意思是，如果我们在创办一家IT初创公司，那么我们想要斯堪的纳维亚的**平等主义**，对吧？所以我们希望整个组织中的等级制度非常低。但我们希望决策能够像印度一样超级快速和灵活。我们希望决策能够迅速做出，并且能够迅速改变。这是因为当然，在初创公司环境中，我的意思是，我们周围的一切都在变化，就像在印度一样，我们周围的一切都在变化。我们可能需要迅速改变我们的产品，我们可能需要一次又一次地重塑自我。所以通常，一种更自上而下的决策方法会更有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay but let's say let's say that you and I are doing an IT startup okay right I mean if if we're doing an IT startup then we want the egalitarianism of Scandinavia right okay so we want very low levels of hierarchy throughout the organization but we want super fast and flexible decisions like in India okay we want decisions to be made quickly and we want them to be able to be changed quickly and that's because of course in a startup environment I mean everything's changing around us like in India right everything changing around and around us we may need to change our product quickly we might need to reinvent ourselves again and again so often a more top down a decision-making approach would be more effective</p>
</details>

我实际上认为，在初创公司环境中，我们在沟通时要尽可能直接。世界上最直接的文化是荷兰和以色列。所以让我们在提供反馈时像荷兰人或以色列人一样。但我们也要投入时间去了解彼此。我实际上认为这适用于所有行业和所有工作，如果你的工作有任何国际成分，你都希望花更多时间建立个人关系，因为一旦我们有了这种基本信任，那么如果你对我说话太直接，我也会原谅你。如果我们没有那种信任，而你对我说话太直接，那将是我最后一次想和你合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I actually think in a startup environment we want to be as direct as possible when we're giving communication the most direct cultures in the world the Netherlands and Israel so let's be Dutch or Israeli in the way that we give feedback um but let's also invest time in getting to know one another and I actually think that's true across industry and across work that you're doing if you have any International component in your work you want to spend a lot more time in building personal relationships because once we have that fundamental trust then if you speak too directly to me I will forgive you if we don't have that trust and you speak too directly to me that's really going to be the the last time that I want to work with you</p>

所以我想你可以真正思考你的目标是什么，你从事什么行业，你想实现什么，然后你就可以规划出哪种文化类型，哪种国家最适合你，最适合你的组织。

主持人: 首席执行官应该花多少时间在公司文化上？我想暂时转换一下话题。我们一直在谈论我的《文化地图》这本书，但我写了第二本书，是与**Netflix**的创始人兼董事长里德·黑斯廷斯（Reed Hastings）合著的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how much time should this how much time uh should a CEO spend on Copa culture I want to just transition for a moment so we were talking a lot about my culture mapping book right but I wrote this this second book is you know with uh with Reed Hastings who's the the founder and chairman of Netflix</p>
</details>

艾琳·迈耶: 我与里德合作时看到的是，他领导团队的方式，我的意思是，他真的试图摆脱这种金字塔模型，即领导者位于金字塔的顶端，而是将领导者像树一样置于树根处，并且采用非常**平等主义**的结构。所以，我认为我们可以这样思考：在一家传统公司中，决策模型是董事长位于顶端，低层员工位于金字塔底部。低层员工可以做出不重要的决定，但对于任何重要或昂贵的决定，我们都必须将决策权上推到组织高层。当然，在传统的制造业环境中，这是一种很好的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so what I saw with with re with when I was doing this work with Reed because he leads his team um I mean he's really trying to move away from this pyramid model where the the leader is at the top of the at the top of the pyramid and instead kind of put the leader like a tree down at the roots of the tree um and with a very egalitarian carian structure so um what I think we can think about that and is an a traditional company uh the decision-making model has the the chairman at the top and the lower level employees at the bottom of the pyramid right and the lower level employees can make small unimportant decisions but for anything important or expensive we have to push the decision- making up in the organization and of course in a um in a traditional like manufacturing environment that's a great method</p>
</details>

但在这些新兴公司和当今的敏捷世界中，我们需要更快、更灵活、更具创造力，我确实相信最好的决策方法更像一棵树。在这棵树中，领导者位于树根的泥土中，不做出重大决策，而是通过**情境而非控制**（context not control: Netflix的领导力原则，强调提供足够信息和背景，让员工自主决策）来领导。或者像**Netflix**所说的，我非常喜欢的一句话是：“不要试图取悦你的老板，而要努力为公司做最好的事情。”

<p class="english-text">but in these like newer companies and to today's agile world where we have to be faster and more flexible and more creative I do believe that the best decision-making method is a lot more like a tree and with that tree we've got the leader okay who's down there in the dirt at the roots of the tree not making the big decisions but instead leading with context not control or something they say at Netflix that I love don't seek to please your boss seek to do what's best for the company</p>

在这种模式下，当然，我现在要回答您的问题了，在这种模式下，老板不是主要的决策者，而是为整个组织的决策制定所有情境。在这种模式下，低层员工通常位于树的顶端，做出通常是组织中最大、最昂贵的决策。在这种模式下，我认为领导者应该将50%的时间用于与公司中的个人合作，指导他们如何在组织中做出决策，我们的组织文化是什么，面对这种困境我们将做出什么样的决策，我们的**北极星**（North Star: 指导公司方向和决策的核心愿景或目标）是什么，以及我们如何朝着那个**北极星**前进。我们更多地成为一名教练，而不是决策者，或者可以说，我们在领导方式上更像挪威人，更像平等者之间的协调者。

<p class="english-text">and with that model of course now I'm coming to the answer to your question with that model where the boss is not the chief decision maker but instead setting all of the context for the decision-making throughout the organization and with that model you have um the the lower level employees that are often there at the top of the tree making the often the biggest most expensive decisions for the organization and in that kind of model I believe that a leader should be spending 50% of his or her time working with the individuals in the company coaching them on on how we make decisions in this organization so what is our organizational culture here um how do we what kind of decision will we make in the face of this dilemma um what is our North Star and how are we running towards that North Star and we become more of a um more of a coach than a decision maker or as you we could say a little bit nor more Norwegian in the way that we're leading a little bit more of a facilitator among you</p>

主持人: 我想我肯定足够挪威化了，艾琳。我们有成千上万的年轻人收听这个播客，我很想问您，您对年轻人有什么建议？

<p class="english-text">well I think for sure I'm Norwegian enough Erin we have um um tens of thousands of young people listening to the bcast and I'd love to ask you what is your advice to young people</p>

### 给年轻人的建议

艾琳·迈耶: 是的，当然，今天的年轻人早上醒来，打开电脑，就会有来自世界各地的人加入他们。也许你有一个在巴西工作的团队，另一个人在尼日利亚。很容易低估文化对你沟通的影响。所以我想一个很好的例子是，你可能会注意到你的团队中那些来自美国的人一直在说话，而你团队中那个来自中国的人似乎不怎么说话。但你只是觉得：“哦，那个中国人没什么好说的，而那些美国人显然有很多话想说。”

<p class="english-text">yeah so of course young people today they wake up in the morning they open up their computers they have people from all over the world who are joining them maybe you've got I don't know a team you're working with in Brazil someone else uh in uh uh uh Nigeria um and it's very easy to underestimate the impact of uh of culture on your communication so I think an example a great example of that would be that maybe you notice that like uh these guys from the US on your team they're talking all the time and maybe you've got this guy from China and he doesn't seem to speak very much but you just think oh well that guy from China he doesn't have much to say and those guys from the US they clearly have a lot that they'd like to contribute</p>
</details>

所以，很容易陷入这种假设，认为文化不会影响我们。给年轻人的建议是：不要低估文化对我们沟通的影响，即使我们在虚拟环境中工作，即使与我们沟通的人看起来和我们很像。

<p class="english-text">um but so it's easy to slip into this kind of assumption that culture isn't impacting us so the advice to young people is don't underestimate how much culture impacts our communication even when we are working in Virtual environments and even when the people that we are communicating with seem to be just like us</p>
</details>

然后花一些时间去学习。所以，你知道，我用我的**文化地图方法论**（culture mapping methodology）所做的是，我给人们一个机会去审视一种文化，然后说：“哦，我看到那种文化比我的文化更直接。所以也许那个人并没有生我的气，也许他只是在向我表达尊重。而在那种文化中，他们以一种比我的文化更注重关系的方式建立信任。所以也许那个人没有回复我的邮件，是因为我直接切入主题，而没有真正分享一些关于我自己的事情，甚至没有表现出了解他个人的兴趣。所以下次我给他打电话时，我会采取不同的方法。”

<p class="english-text">and then take some time to learn so you know what I do with my culture mapping methodology is I give people an opportunity to kind of look at one culture and say oh I see that culture is a little bit more direct than mine so maybe that guy wasn't angry with me maybe he was just showing me respect and in that culture they build trust in a little bit more relationship oriented way than they do in my culture so maybe the reason that that guy didn't respond to my email is because I dived right into the material and I didn't really give him I didn't really share anything about myself or even share show interest and getting to know him personally so when I get him on the phone the next time I'm going to take a different approach</p>
</details>

当然，这个地图并没有给你一个食谱，我们都是独立的个体，但它确实能帮助你区分什么是文化性的，什么是个人性的，这样我们就能更具战略性和同理心。

<p class="english-text">and of course the mapping it it doesn't give you a recipe we're all individuals but it does help you to kind of tease out like what's cultural and what's personal so that we can be more strategic and more empathic</p>
</details>

主持人: 非常棒的建议。我可能想补充一点：把你的所有积蓄都花在旅行和背包旅行上，去看看这个世界。

<p class="english-text">really great advice I perhaps want to add one thing spend all your savings on traveling and backpacking and see the world</p>

艾琳·迈耶: 说得对，当然，我们越是了解世界，就越能认识到我们自己的文化有多么奇怪。我认为这种自我反思是文化学习中最重要的一种，因为否则我们只会认为其他人都很奇怪，做得不对。当我们意识到“哈，我其实和别人一样奇怪”时，就完全不同了。

<p class="english-text">that's right and of course the more we see the world the more we recognize how strange our own culture is and I think that that own self that self-reflection is one of the most important types of of cultural learning because otherwise we just think that everyone else is strange and doing it wrong when we act when we realize actually huh seems that I'm just as strange as everyone else absolutely</p>
</details>

主持人: 绝对如此。我肯定会更多地思考如何适应我们设有办事处的各个国家，尤其是在反馈和让人们参与等方面。这真是一次非常非常有趣的对话。我向大家推荐阅读您的书《文化地图》。它真的改变了我看待文化的方式。非常感谢您来到这里，祝您的工作一切顺利。
