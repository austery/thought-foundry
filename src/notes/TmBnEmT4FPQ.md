### 诺贝尔奖：日本的成就与中国的焦虑

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说。过去一周，瑞典皇家科学院陆续公布了本年度的诺贝尔奖名单。与去年相比，今年的名单在中国大陆网络上明显引发了更多讨论。原因很简单，今年的名单中出现了两位日本科学家的名字：一位是获得了医学奖的**板口志文**，另一位是刚获得化学奖的**北川静**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says. In the past week, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences successively announced this year's Nobel Prize winners. Compared to last year, this year's list clearly sparked more discussion on the Chinese internet. The reason is simple: two Japanese scientists appeared on this year's list: Tasuku Honjo, who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and Susumu Kitagawa, who just received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
</details>

算起来，日本已经总计获得了32座诺贝尔奖，其中仅在本世纪，即2000年以后，就高达24座。要知道，2001年日本政府曾提出要在50年内获得30个诺贝尔奖。当时中国官媒曾不屑一顾，并在报道中用“口出狂言”来形容。如今时间才过了一半，人家的目标已经完成了80%，狂言眼看就要成真了，这怎么能不让某些“U型锁”们着急上火呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Counting them up, Japan has accumulated a total of 32 Nobel Prizes, with as many as 24 of those awarded in this century alone, after 2000. It's worth noting that in 2001, the Japanese government proposed to win 30 Nobel Prizes within 50 years. At the time, Chinese state media dismissed this, describing it as "boasting." Now, only half the time has passed, and their goal is already 80% complete, with the "boast" seemingly about to come true. How could this not make some "U-lock nationalists" anxious and angry?</p>
</details>

于是乎，中国大陆世界各种声音都出来了。有指责日本人靠公关的，有酸葡萄说诺贝尔奖是西方人的奖，都偏袒自己人，这种奖不拿也罢。还有强行“赢”的，说虽然我们拿不到奖，但一点不耽误我们登月、六代机和东风导弹啊！等啥时候我们的导弹给美国、欧洲、全世界都打服了，他们求着给我们颁奖还来不及呢！以上这几种都属于比较反智的，我们就不浪费时间介绍了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Consequently, various voices emerged from the Chinese mainland. Some accused the Japanese of relying on public relations, while others, with sour grapes, claimed the Nobel Prize is a Western award biased towards their own people, suggesting it's not worth winning. There were also those who forcefully declared "victory," saying that even if we don't win awards, it doesn't stop us from landing on the moon, developing sixth-generation fighters, and Dongfeng missiles! When our missiles subdue America, Europe, and the whole world, they'll be begging to give us awards! The above types are all rather anti-intellectual, so we won't waste time discussing them.</p>
</details>

但与此同时，也有不少人在认真地探讨为什么中国拿诺贝尔奖那么难，以及中国的诺贝尔奖什么时候才会爆发。接下来，我也会根据自己的理解，谈谈对这两个问题的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, at the same time, many people are seriously discussing why it is so difficult for China to win Nobel Prizes, and when China's Nobel Prize "explosion" will occur. Next, I will also share my views on these two questions based on my understanding.</p>
</details>

### 诺贝尔奖归属的界定与中国的现状

在讨论这些问题之前，我们得先理清一个定义，那就是“某国拿诺贝尔奖”这个说法其实不准确，因为诺贝尔奖是颁发给个人的。所以，你只能说拥有某国国籍的人拿诺贝尔奖，也就是他在得奖时是哪国人。但仅仅只有个国籍，也不能证明你这个国家就有多强的教育和科研实力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before discussing these issues, we must first clarify a definition: the phrase "a certain country wins a Nobel Prize" is actually inaccurate, because the Nobel Prize is awarded to individuals. Therefore, you can only say that a person holding a certain nationality wins a Nobel Prize, meaning what nationality they held at the time of receiving the award. However, merely possessing a nationality does not prove the strength of that country's education and scientific research capabilities.</p>
</details>

最典型的例子就是刚和**北川静**一起获得了诺贝尔化学奖的**奥马尔亚籍**（Omar Yaghi: 著名材料化学家，以其在金属有机框架材料MOFs领域的开创性工作而闻名）。理论上，他依然拥有巴勒斯坦的公民权，算是巴勒斯坦人。但一查履历你就会发现，他被看作是巴勒斯坦人唯一的原因是他的父母都是巴勒斯坦难民，而他本人则是在约旦出生的，15岁跟随父母移民到美国。他的高中、大学教育以及此后的研究工作都是在美国完成的。他这辈子可能都没去过巴勒斯坦。这种情况下，巴勒斯坦如果站出来宣称亚吉是为国争光、与有荣焉，似乎也有点过于牵强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most typical example is Omar Yaghi, who just won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside Susumu Kitagawa. Theoretically, he still holds Palestinian citizenship and is considered Palestinian. However, upon checking his resume, you'll find that the only reason he is considered Palestinian is that his parents were Palestinian refugees, while he himself was born in Jordan and immigrated to the United States with his parents at the age of 15. All his high school and university education, as well as his subsequent research work, were completed in the United States. He may never have even visited Palestine in his life. In such a situation, if Palestine were to claim Yaghi brought honor to the nation and shared in his glory, it would seem a bit far-fetched.</p>
</details>

所以，当我们讨论某国拿到诺贝尔奖时，其实包含了三个要素：第一，得奖人得奖时是不是该国国籍；第二，他的主要受教育经历发生在哪个国家；第三，他得奖的研究成果是在哪个国家做出的。其中第二、第三点尤其重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, when we discuss a country winning a Nobel Prize, it actually includes three elements: first, whether the laureate held that country's nationality at the time of the award; second, in which country their main educational experience took place; and third, in which country their award-winning research was conducted. The second and third points are particularly important.</p>
</details>

其实按照这个标准，日本的32座诺贝尔奖也要打部分折扣。因为1987年的**历根川静**和2010年的**根岸英一**虽然都还是日本籍，但他们的博士学位和主要研究工作都是在美国完成的。而**南部杨一郎**等三人呢，获奖时已经是美国籍了。至于2017年获得诺贝尔文学奖的**石黑一雄**，则是五岁就已经移居英国，他创作小说时用的也都是英文。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, by this standard, Japan's 32 Nobel Prizes also need to be partially discounted. For instance, Susumu Tonegawa (1987) and Ei-ichi Negishi (2010), although still Japanese nationals, completed their doctoral degrees and primary research work in the United States. As for Yoichiro Nambu and two others, they were already U.S. citizens when they received their awards. Kazuo Ishiguro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017, had moved to the UK at the age of five, and he wrote his novels in English.</p>
</details>

但除开这几位，实实在在由日本培养、在日本做出研究成果、获奖时依然是日本籍的诺贝尔奖得主依然有26位。并且，**南部杨一郎**等三人虽然是美国籍，但考虑到他们的博士学位和研究工作都是在日本完成的，也基本上可以算是日本诺贝尔奖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, excluding these individuals, there are still 26 Nobel laureates who were genuinely educated in Japan, conducted their research there, and held Japanese nationality at the time of their awards. Furthermore, although Yoichiro Nambu and two others were U.S. citizens, considering their doctoral degrees and research work were completed in Japan, they can largely be counted as Japanese Nobel laureates.</p>
</details>

如果按上面这个标准，地地道道“中国制造”的诺贝尔奖得主尤其只有**屠呦呦**、**莫言**、**刘晓波**三位（因为**达赖喇嘛**目前的国籍状况存疑）。这个数量在全球各国排第31位，和白俄罗斯、克罗地亚、墨西哥相当。当然，前提是中国承认**刘晓波**的这个和平奖；如果不承认，那就只剩下两座，直接调到38位，和伊朗、巴基斯坦、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚相当了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we apply the above standard, there are only three genuinely "Made in China" Nobel laureates: Tu Youyou, Mo Yan, and Liu Xiaobo (as the Dalai Lama's current nationality status is uncertain). This number ranks 31st globally, on par with Belarus, Croatia, and Mexico. Of course, this is assuming China recognizes Liu Xiaobo's Peace Prize; if not, there would only be two, dropping China directly to 38th place, on par with Iran, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Algeria.</p>
</details>

如果再考虑到人口规模，那中国毫无疑问是全球人均诺贝尔奖数量最少的国家之一。要知道，哪怕是“粉红”们最看不上的印度也拿了十座。这显然跟墙内某些人一直吹嘘的“中国国力领先美国100年”和“中国人平均智商世界第一”形成了强烈反差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we further consider population size, China is undoubtedly one of the countries with the fewest Nobel Prizes per capita globally. It's worth noting that even India, which "pinkies" (Chinese nationalists) often disparage, has won ten. This clearly forms a stark contrast with the claims some people within China's firewall constantly boast about, such as "China's national strength is 100 years ahead of the US" and "Chinese people have the highest average IQ in the world."</p>
</details>

### 诺贝尔奖滞后论与制度论的探讨

关于这一现象，除了“粉红”们说的各种阴谋论以外，常见的解释有这么几种。第一种可能也是支持者最多的，叫“**诺奖滞后论**”。这种理论认为，诺贝尔奖级的成果是需要拿钱砸的，过去中国拿的少是因为穷、底子薄、科研投入少。而中国经济真正开始起飞也就是最近二十几年，考虑到诺贝尔奖的科学类奖项通常有二十年左右的滞后期，可以预见到2030年以后中国的诺贝尔奖数量将会出现井喷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding this phenomenon, apart from the various conspiracy theories proposed by "pinkies," there are several common explanations. The first, and perhaps most supported, is the "Nobel Prize lag theory." This theory posits that Nobel-level achievements require significant financial investment. In the past, China won fewer awards due to poverty, a weak foundation, and low research investment. China's economy truly began to take off only in the last two decades. Considering that scientific Nobel Prizes typically have a lag period of about twenty years, it is foreseeable that China's Nobel Prize count will experience a surge after 2030.</p>
</details>

支持这一观点的人还举了日本的例子，因为日本本世纪以来获得的诺贝尔奖大都是上世纪90年代经济腾飞时期的成果。需要说明的是，这种理论不是今天才出现的，事实上每隔几年都会有专家站出来预测说若干年内中国会获得多少个诺贝尔奖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Proponents of this view also cite Japan's example, as most of Japan's Nobel Prizes this century are the result of achievements from its economic boom in the 1990s. It should be noted that this theory is not new; in fact, every few years, experts emerge to predict how many Nobel Prizes China will win within a certain number of years.</p>
</details>

比如2007年开始，**杨振宁**就在多个场合公开预测过说10到20年内中国就会有人拿到诺贝尔奖，他说的还算比较保守，因为也没说拿几个。过了几年，**屠呦呦**也确实拿了，人家没预测错。但接下来的预测就比较离谱了。比如2013年，**中科院**院士**黄维**对媒体表示说十年之内，也就是到2023年，中国人拿诺贝尔奖就应该如家常便饭。2015年，首义大学的校长**饶毅**也预测说中国将在2035年以后出现诺贝尔奖井喷，到2050年左右诺贝尔奖总数将全面超过日本。最夸张的还得属**清华高教研究所**所长**王小阳**，他的看法是到2050年中国可能会出现100个诺贝尔奖，秒杀日本。至于中国教育体制扼杀创新导致拿不到诺贝尔奖的说法，则完全属于“公知抹黑”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, starting in 2007, Chen-Ning Yang publicly predicted on multiple occasions that someone in China would win a Nobel Prize within 10 to 20 years. His prediction was relatively conservative, as he didn't specify how many. A few years later, Tu Youyou indeed won, so his prediction wasn't wrong. However, subsequent predictions became more exaggerated. For instance, in 2013, Huang Wei, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told the media that within ten years, meaning by 2023, Chinese people winning Nobel Prizes should become commonplace. In 2015, Rao Yi, president of Shouyi University, also predicted that China would see a surge in Nobel Prizes after 2035, with the total number of Nobel Prizes fully surpassing Japan's by around 2050. The most exaggerated prediction came from Wang Xiaoyang, director of Tsinghua University Institute of Education, who believed that China might produce 100 Nobel Prizes by 2050, instantly surpassing Japan. As for the argument that China's education system stifles innovation, leading to a lack of Nobel Prizes, he dismissed it as "smearing by public intellectuals."</p>
</details>

以上还是目前网上能查到的。事实上，在我的印象里，类似的观点从上世纪八九十年代就开始了。我小的时候，媒体的说法是到2000年，就连前学生都做过类似的论断。到我上大学的时候，普遍预测时间又推到了2010年左右，只是因为年代久远，那会儿的信息现在查不到了而已。似乎你只要不停地把这个井喷时间往后推，牛皮就能一直吹下去。反正聊的都是20年以后的事，那会儿年轻人还有几个记得并且跟你翻旧账较真呢？没准网上都查不到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The above are still traceable online. In fact, in my memory, similar views began in the 1980s and 1990s. When I was young, the media's narrative was that by 2000, even former students had made similar assertions. By the time I went to college, the general prediction time had been pushed back to around 2010, simply because it was so long ago that information from that era is no longer traceable online. It seems that as long as you keep pushing back the predicted "explosion" time, the boast can continue indefinitely. After all, we're talking about things 20 years in the future; how many young people will remember and hold you accountable then? Perhaps the information won't even be searchable online.</p>
</details>

除开这种有点自欺欺人的“诺奖滞后论”，另一种“**制度论**”则显得更加务实。这种理论认为，中国人拿诺贝尔奖难最根本的原因还在于中国的教育制度和学术氛围，很大程度上抑制着创新。更具体地说，诺贝尔奖更看重基础科学和技术的原创性，而这些研究成果具有相当程度的偶然性，只有好奇心驱动、忍得住寂寞、愿意坐冷板凳的科研人员才有可能成功。而中国的情况是从义务教育阶段开始就扼杀学生的好奇心，灌输标准答案，崇尚实用主义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Aside from this somewhat self-deceptive "Nobel Prize lag theory," another "institutional theory" appears more pragmatic. This theory posits that the fundamental reason for China's difficulty in winning Nobel Prizes lies in its education system and academic atmosphere, which largely suppress innovation. More specifically, the Nobel Prize places greater emphasis on the originality of basic science and technology, and these research achievements have a considerable degree of serendipity. Only researchers driven by curiosity, willing to endure solitude, and patiently work on fundamental problems are likely to succeed. In China, however, the situation is that students' curiosity is stifled from the compulsory education stage, standard answers are instilled, and pragmatism is glorified.</p>
</details>

到了科研阶段，考核标准更是严重的功利导向。比如之前聊过的“飞升即走”，要晋升就必须在顶级期刊发多少篇论文等等，以至于搞出了一个庞大的付费发论文的产业链。这相当于鼓励所有的研究人员都扎堆去搞那些热门、容易出成果的方向，和学术精神背道而驰了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the research phase, evaluation standards are even more severely utilitarian-driven. For example, as discussed before, the "publish or perish" mentality dictates that one must publish a certain number of papers in top-tier journals to get promoted, leading to a massive industry of paid paper publications. This effectively encourages all researchers to flock towards popular, easily achievable research areas, which runs counter to the spirit of academic inquiry.</p>
</details>

再有就是学术领域严重的官僚风气。比如一篇论文十几二十个作者，真正做出贡献的人反而排在导师后面。再比如70%的科研经费都是竞争性的课题，平均周期不超过三年，支撑不了需要长期沉淀的重大项目等等。以上这些观点有道理吗？有，但似乎还有一点流于表面，因为它描述的更多是现象而不是背后的成因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Furthermore, there is a severe bureaucratic atmosphere in academia. For instance, a single paper might have a dozen or twenty authors, with those who genuinely contributed ranked behind their supervisors. Another example is that 70% of research funding comes from competitive projects with an average cycle of no more than three years, which cannot support major projects requiring long-term accumulation. Are these points valid? Yes, but they seem to remain somewhat superficial, as they describe phenomena rather than underlying causes.</p>
</details>

### “战时思维”：中国科研急功近利的深层原因

接下来就说说我自己的观点，也就是为什么中国的学术和研究氛围会呈现出这种急功近利的取向。在阐述观点前，我们需要先了解诺贝尔奖是干嘛的，它的评奖标准是什么。根据诺贝尔奖官网上的解释，诺贝尔奖是根据**阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔**先生的遗嘱设立的，它最高的核心标准是“对人类做出最大的贡献”。注意这个定语啊，是为人类做出最大贡献，而不是为某个国家、某个政权或者某个政党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, I will discuss my own perspective on why China's academic and research atmosphere exhibits such a utilitarian inclination. Before elaborating, we need to understand what the Nobel Prize is for and what its judging criteria are. According to the explanation on the Nobel Prize official website, the Nobel Prize was established in accordance with the will of Mr. Alfred Nobel, and its highest core criterion is to "have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind." Note this qualifier: it is to make the greatest contribution to humankind, not to a specific country, regime, or political party.</p>
</details>

所以，墙内经常有人讨论什么**钱学森**、**邓稼先**贡献那么大，凭什么拿不到一个诺贝尔奖，甚至有人夸张地表示“不是钱学森拿不到诺奖，而是诺奖配不上钱学森”，这都属于是笑料了。因为钱、邓干的事儿不过是为**中共党卫军**添砖加瓦，唯一的贡献就是帮助巩固党的独裁统治，防止老百姓造反。这类所谓“伟大贡献”的研究人员，每个“中国人民的老朋友”国家都有：苏联有造原子弹的**库尔恰托夫**和造氢弹的**萨哈罗夫**；朝鲜有核弹之父**徐向国**；巴基斯坦有**阿卜杜拉·卡迪尔·汉**；伊朗有**法赫里扎德**。**钱学森**、**邓稼先**和那些人并没有什么不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, inside China's firewall, people often discuss why Qian Xuesen and Deng Jiaxian, despite their immense contributions, couldn't win a Nobel Prize. Some even exaggeratedly claim, "It's not that Qian Xuesen couldn't win a Nobel Prize, but that the Nobel Prize isn't worthy of Qian Xuesen." These are all jokes. Because what Qian and Deng did was merely to add bricks and tiles to the CCP's party army, their sole contribution being to help consolidate the Party's dictatorial rule and prevent the populace from rebelling. Such researchers, credited with so-called "great contributions," exist in every country considered an "old friend of the Chinese people": the Soviet Union had Igor Kurchatov, who built the atomic bomb, and Andrei Sakharov, who built the hydrogen bomb; North Korea has its nuclear father Xu Xiangguo; Pakistan has Abdul Qadeer Khan; and Iran has Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Qian Xuesen and Deng Jiaxian were no different from those individuals.</p>
</details>

按这个标准，别说以上这几位，哪怕最早搞出了原子弹的**奥本海默**（J. Robert Oppenheimer: 美国理论物理学家，被誉为“原子弹之父”）也是没资格得奖的。事实上，从有诺贝尔奖以来，就没有任何一个科学家是因为研发出了某种武器而得奖，甚至获得提名的，因为这和诺贝尔奖设立的初衷就不符嘛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By this standard, let alone the aforementioned individuals, even J. Robert Oppenheimer, who first developed the atomic bomb, would not be eligible for the award. In fact, since the inception of the Nobel Prize, no scientist has ever won or even been nominated for developing a weapon, because it goes against the original intent of the Nobel Prize's establishment.</p>
</details>

其次是**瑞典皇家科学院**给出的学术性解释：诺贝尔奖主要奖励的是概念性的飞跃而非单纯的技术应用，也就是那些带来知识上的突破、根本性地改变人类对世界认知的发现或者发明。从这个角度来说，很多“粉红”津津乐道的中国教科书上的那些所谓“伟大成就”，比如什么人工合成牛胰岛素、**侯德榜**的**联合制碱法**等等，离诺贝尔奖都差了十万八千里。因为它们不仅远远够不上改变人类对世界的认知，连原创性的技术运用也都算不上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Secondly, there is the academic explanation provided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: the Nobel Prize primarily rewards conceptual leaps rather than mere technological applications, meaning discoveries or inventions that bring about breakthroughs in knowledge and fundamentally change humanity's understanding of the world. From this perspective, many of the so-called "great achievements" in Chinese textbooks that "pinkies" enthusiastically praise, such as the artificial synthesis of bovine insulin or Hou Debang's combined soda ash process, are miles away from Nobel Prize level. This is because they not only fall far short of changing humanity's understanding of the world but also cannot even be considered original technological applications.</p>
</details>

比如最早研究并确定了**胰岛素**（Insulin: 由胰脏分泌的一种激素，主要功能是调节血糖）分子结构的是英国科学家**弗雷德里克·桑格**，他也因此获得了1958年的诺贝尔化学奖。而那项中国中学生都熟知的成果，完整名称应该是“首次体外人工合成具有生物活性的结晶牛胰岛素”。“体外人工合成”和“具有生物活性”是两个重要的定语，因为它既不是第一个体外人工合成的胰岛素，也不是科学家获得的第一个有活性的胰岛素，只是众多的按照桑格给出的分子式在实验室里合成的胰岛素之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, the British scientist Frederick Sanger was the first to research and determine the molecular structure of insulin, for which he received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The achievement familiar to Chinese middle school students should be fully named "the first *in vitro* artificial synthesis of biologically active crystalline bovine insulin." "In vitro artificial synthesis" and "biologically active" are two important qualifiers, because it was neither the first insulin synthesized *in vitro*, nor the first active insulin obtained by scientists, but merely one of many insulins synthesized in laboratories according to Sanger's molecular formula.</p>
</details>

除了中国合成的牛胰岛素，还有美、德等国家合成的猪胰岛素、人胰岛素等等。并且中国的这项技术在获得成功后很快就被淘汰，也从未投入量产。可以说没能产生任何的实际影响，唯一的影响大概就是被写进教科书，在对背景掐头去尾的情况下增强了几代中国孩子的民族自豪感。**侯德榜**的**侯氏制碱法**也是一样，它既不是世界上最早的制碱法，也不是今天最主流的制碱法，而只是对比利时化学家**索尔维**的**氨碱法**（Solvay process: 一种工业生产碳酸钠的方法）的改良法之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition to the bovine insulin synthesized in China, there was also porcine insulin, human insulin, etc., synthesized in countries like the US and Germany. Moreover, this Chinese technology was quickly phased out after its success and never put into mass production. It can be said that it had no practical impact whatsoever; its only impact was probably being written into textbooks, enhancing the national pride of several generations of Chinese children by selectively presenting the context. Hou Debang's Hou's soda process is similar; it is neither the world's earliest soda production method nor today's most mainstream, but merely one of the improved methods based on the Solvay process developed by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay.</p>
</details>

了解了以上这些信息，你就明白为什么中国作为全球第一制造大国，号称每年的专利和论文数遥遥领先，却很难拿到诺贝尔奖的原因了。因为“粉红”心目中最能彰显中国强大的那些成就，都只能算是改进型的技术应用。不信你盘点一下所有经常被国人拿出来显摆、津津乐道的成就，从所谓的“国之重器”什么两弹一星、航母、六代机、登月、空间站、无人机，到民生领域的所谓“新四大发明”，也就是高铁、网购、移动支付和共享单车，这里有哪个改变了人类对世界的认知？又有哪个发明是原创的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Understanding this information, you will realize why China, as the world's largest manufacturing nation, claiming to lead in annual patent and paper counts, finds it difficult to win Nobel Prizes. This is because the achievements that "pinkies" believe best demonstrate China's strength can only be considered improved technological applications. If you don't believe it, take stock of all the achievements frequently showcased and celebrated by Chinese people, from the so-called "national heavyweights" like the Two Bombs and One Satellite, aircraft carriers, sixth-generation fighters, moon landings, space stations, drones, to the "new four great inventions" in the civilian sector—high-speed rail, online shopping, mobile payments, and shared bicycles. Which of these has changed humanity's understanding of the world? And which invention is truly original?</p>
</details>

这里不是说应用就不重要，而是你得正视一个客观事实：中国的长项从来不是原创，而是成本控制，也就是围绕一个人家已经发明出来的东西降本增效，通过低人群优势和市场规模把成本打下来，建立起低成本可商用的供应链。比如国人引以为傲的新能源和光伏发电，新能源的核心**锂电池**（Lithium-ion battery: 一种可充电电池，广泛应用于电子产品和电动汽车）是日本科学家**吉野章**发明的，**光伏发电**（Photovoltaic power generation: 利用太阳能电池板将太阳光直接转化为电能的技术）的核心技术是**美国贝尔实验室**的三位科学家上世纪50年代搞出来的，都不是什么新技术。中国唯一的优势是造得更便宜，但诺贝尔奖显然不是为了造得更便宜而设立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is not to say that application is unimportant, but you must face an objective fact: China's strength has never been originality, but cost control. That is, taking something already invented by others, reducing costs and increasing efficiency, bringing down costs through a large population advantage and market scale, and establishing a low-cost, commercially viable supply chain. For example, the new energy and photovoltaic power generation that Chinese people are proud of: the core lithium-ion battery for new energy was invented by Japanese scientist Akira Yoshino, and the core technology for photovoltaic power generation was developed by three scientists at Bell Labs in the United States in the 1950s; neither is new technology. China's only advantage is making things cheaper, but the Nobel Prize was clearly not established for making things cheaper.</p>

那中国为什么就不能在造得更便宜之外，也重视一下原创或者基础性的理论研究呢？要知道，在过去的三年间，中国的研发投入一直位列全球第二，科研资金占GDP的比重也高达2.58%，位列全球第12位。根本的原因可能在于，从1949年建政到现在，中国一直就是个围绕“**战时思维**”打造的国家。

<p class="english-text">So why can't China, in addition to making things cheaper, also prioritize original or fundamental theoretical research? It's worth noting that over the past three years, China's R&D investment has consistently ranked second globally, and its research funding as a percentage of GDP reached 2.58%, ranking 12th worldwide. The fundamental reason may be that, from its founding in 1949 to the present, China has consistently been a nation built around a "wartime mentality."</p>
</details>

所谓“战时思维”是一种在面对极端生存挑战或者重大危机时被激活和主导的思维模式。它最主要的特点是目标唯一化，也就是把所有的复杂问题简化为一个核心目标。举个例子，我很喜欢玩那种模拟经营类的游戏。玩过这类的游戏的朋友都知道，建设一个城市或者国家其实是很复杂的，需要盯着一大堆不同的目标参数，比如城市建设、商业繁荣度、科技发展、宗教建筑、民主指数、新闻及言论自由、军事力量等等等等。而这些目标之间往往存在着一定的排斥性，因为你的资源就那么多嘛，多建一个军事建筑就少一个宗教建筑。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The so-called "wartime mentality" is a mode of thinking activated and dominated when facing extreme existential challenges or major crises. Its primary characteristic is the singularization of goals, meaning all complex problems are simplified into one core objective. For example, I enjoy playing simulation management games. Friends who have played these games know that building a city or a nation is actually very complex, requiring attention to a multitude of different target parameters, such as urban development, commercial prosperity, technological advancement, religious buildings, democracy index, freedom of speech and press, military strength, and so on. These goals often have certain exclusionary relationships, because your resources are limited; building one more military structure means one less religious building.</p>
</details>

成熟的玩家往往要在这一大堆目标之间搞平衡，才能建立起一个整体上高水平的文明。而这种平衡的艺术跟现实生活其实是很像的，民主国家的政客制定政策时也得综合考虑，不能围绕单一或者极少数的几个目标转。但“战时思维”就不同了，它会把整个社会所有人的诉求简化成一个目标，那就是打赢这场战争。为了这个目标，什么人权、言论自由、物质生活水平都得靠边站，一切为发展军事力量服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Experienced players often need to balance this multitude of goals to build a civilization that is high-level overall. This art of balancing is quite similar to real life; politicians in democratic countries must also consider various factors when formulating policies, rather than focusing on a single or a very few objectives. However, a "wartime mentality" is different; it simplifies the demands of everyone in society into one goal: winning the war. For this goal, human rights, freedom of speech, and material living standards all take a backseat, with everything serving the development of military power.</p>
</details>

本来在战争年代你这么做也无可厚非，但问题是，类似中国这样的国家会把战争的概念泛化，从而实现“战时思维”的常态化。说人话就是，任何时候都是战时，都要按照战时标准来。这么说可能有点抽象，我举个例子。**顾维钧**大家都知道吧，就是那个在巴黎和会上拒绝签字，1945年又代表中华民国参加旧金山会议签署了《联合国宪章》的那位民国第一外交官。1948年，**中共**在《人民日报》上公布了第一批43人的所谓“内战战犯名单”，**顾维钧**位列第22位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Normally, doing this during wartime would be understandable, but the problem is that countries like China generalize the concept of war, thereby normalizing the "wartime mentality." In plain language, this means it's always wartime, and everything must be conducted according to wartime standards. This might sound a bit abstract, so let me give an example. Everyone knows V.K. Wellington Koo, right? He was the Republic of China's top diplomat who refused to sign at the Paris Peace Conference and later represented the Republic of China at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 to sign the United Nations Charter. In 1948, the CCP published its first list of 43 so-called "civil war criminals" in the People's Daily, with V.K. Wellington Koo ranked 22nd.</p>
</details>

1949年以后，**顾维钧**跟着**老蒋**去了台湾，后来又去了海牙国际法院做副院长，退休以后在美国定居。1972年，出席联大会议的**中共**代表团成员**张寒之**，也就是**陈凯歌**前妻**洪晃**他妈，受**毛泽东**的委托去拜访**顾维钧**，邀请他回中国看看。顾说：“我是毛泽东点名的战犯，回去批判我吗？”**张寒之**赶忙解释说：“那是非常时期。”顾笑着回答：“贵党何时不是非常时期？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After 1949, V.K. Wellington Koo followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan, later served as Vice President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and settled in the United States after retirement. In 1972, Zhang Hanzhi, a member of the CCP delegation attending the UN General Assembly (and the mother of Chen Kaige's ex-wife Hong Huang), was entrusted by Mao Zedong to visit V.K. Wellington Koo and invite him to visit China. Koo asked, "I am a war criminal named by Mao Zedong, will I be criticized if I go back?" Zhang Hanzhi quickly explained, "That was an extraordinary period." Koo smiled and replied, "When is your Party *not* in an extraordinary period?"</p>
</details>

**顾维钧**的这个回答其实就一语道破了天机。我在之前的节目里曾经提到过，共产党的本质其实就是一种通过持续制造仇恨来维持内部凝聚力，从而为独裁统治创造正当性的这么一个意识形态。这种仇恨既包括对外也包括对内。对外的表现形式就是备战备荒，随时准备打世界大战；对内就是大清洗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">V.K. Wellington Koo's response actually revealed the crucial truth. I've mentioned in previous programs that the essence of the Communist Party is an ideology that maintains internal cohesion by continuously generating hatred, thereby creating legitimacy for its dictatorial rule. This hatred includes both external and internal aspects. Externally, it manifests as preparing for war and famine, always ready for a world war; internally, it's about large-scale purges.</p>
</details>

所以对党而言，确保整个社会长期保持高水平的仇恨度和战争氛围是至关重要的。只有大家都相信“帝国主义亡我之心不死”，你才能搞战时那一套，压制所有不同的声音。如果国内国外都和平了，你还有什么理由搞独裁、拒绝民主化呢？不信你想想，哪怕在所谓的“改开时期”，非军队系统**中共**的官媒上是不是依然会频繁地出现以下这类用语：外交上他们说“斗争精神”、“敢于亮剑”、“底线思维”、“反华势力”；社会治理上他们说“重拳出击”、“铁腕整治”、“扫黑除恶”、“围剿围堵”、“网格化管理”、“拉网式排查”；宣传领域他们说“守住舆论主阵地”、“主战场”、“构筑思想防线”、“抢占意识形态高地”、“敢于斗争”、“善于斗争”、“巩固扩大战果”、“夺取最后胜利”；在经济和科研领域他们会说“遏制和打压”、“防止卡脖子”、“打破技术封锁”、“攻坚克难”、“突围破局”、“亲自挂帅”、“啃硬骨头”。哪怕是在疫情期间，他们也还会说“大国战役打响”、“疫情防控阻击战”、“保卫战”、“白衣战士”、“总指挥”、“请战书”、“人民战争”、“社会总动员”。这种无处不在的战争术语，其实目的只有一个，就是潜移默化培养中国人的战争思维，以便在有需要时能够迅速切换到战时状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, for the Party, ensuring that society maintains a high level of hatred and a wartime atmosphere for the long term is crucial. Only if everyone believes that "imperialism is bent on destroying us" can you implement wartime measures and suppress all dissenting voices. If both domestic and international situations are peaceful, what reason would you have to maintain dictatorship and refuse democratization? If you don't believe it, consider whether, even during the so-called "reform and opening-up period," the CCP's official media outside the military system still frequently uses the following types of language: in diplomacy, they speak of "fighting spirit," "daring to draw the sword," "bottom-line thinking," and "anti-China forces"; in social governance, they speak of "heavy blows," "iron-fisted rectification," "cracking down on gangs and evil," "encirclement and suppression," "grid management," and "blanket investigations"; in the propaganda field, they speak of "holding the main front of public opinion," "main battlefield," "building ideological defenses," "seizing the high ground of ideology," "daring to struggle," "being good at struggle," "consolidating and expanding achievements," and "achieving final victory"; in the economic and scientific research fields, they speak of "containment and suppression," "preventing strangleholds," "breaking technological blockades," "overcoming difficulties," "breaking through and finding new paths," "personally taking command," and "tackling tough challenges." Even during the pandemic, they would still say things like "the great national battle has begun," "the epidemic prevention and control battle," "the defense battle," "white-clad warriors," "commander-in-chief," "letters of challenge," "people's war," and "total social mobilization." The purpose of this ubiquitous wartime terminology is actually singular: to subtly cultivate a wartime mindset among Chinese people, so that they can quickly switch to a wartime state when needed.</p>
</details>

理解了这个背景，你就能明白为什么整个中国社会从上到下都会如此地推崇效率而忽略程序正义和法治建设，强调中央集权和所谓的“集中力量办大事”，把“底线思维”和“国家安全”挂在嘴边，鼓吹集体主义和牺牲精神。你也能理解我们前面的问题，为什么中国的科研这么急功近利了。因为这些都是“战时思维”的延伸，一切为了打仗，或者说准备打仗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Understanding this background, you can comprehend why Chinese society, from top to bottom, so strongly advocates efficiency while neglecting procedural justice and the rule of law, emphasizes central authority and the so-called "concentrating resources to accomplish big tasks," constantly talks about "bottom-line thinking" and "national security," and promotes collectivism and a spirit of sacrifice. You can also understand our earlier question: why is China's scientific research so focused on quick results? Because these are all extensions of the "wartime mentality," everything is for war, or rather, preparing for war.</p>
</details>

一个处于和平时期的国家的科学家，他的驱动力是什么？是求知、探索世界、研究怎么造福全人类，对吧？这也是诺贝尔奖的初衷。而一个处于战时的科学家呢，他会被要求什么？一切以本国利益为重，你搞科研的唯一目标就是为了打赢接下来这场战争。你可以研发武器，研发让人士兵感觉不到疲惫的药物，也可以搞出科技产品帮助政府出口创收，增加国防开支。总之，你的KPI就是帮助本国政府打击敌对国，而不是什么造福全人类或者满足自己的好奇心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the driving force for a scientist in a peaceful country? It's the pursuit of knowledge, exploring the world, and researching how to benefit all humankind, right? This is also the original intention of the Nobel Prize. And what is expected of a scientist in wartime? Everything is centered on national interests; your sole goal in scientific research is to win the upcoming war. You can develop weapons, drugs that make soldiers feel no fatigue, or create technological products to help the government generate export revenue and increase defense spending. In short, your KPI is to help your government strike hostile nations, not to benefit all humankind or satisfy your own curiosity.</p>
</details>

举个极端的例子，假设你是个诺贝尔奖型的生物学家，你可能会研究**T细胞**（T cell: 一种淋巴细胞，在免疫系统中发挥核心作用）和如何治疗癌症，就像这次拿奖的**板口志文**那样。但如果你是个爱党爱国的中国生物学家，按照**中共**推崇的《**超限战**》（Unrestricted Warfare: 中国人民解放军两位大校乔良、王湘穗于1999年出版的军事理论著作，主张超越传统战争范畴，利用一切手段打击敌人）一书中提出的理论，你应该去研究细菌病毒战，或者创造出一种只能杀死美国人和日本人的基因武器。你以为这是危言耸听吗？不，这是党在官方媒体上多次重申和强调的清晰的战略思路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To give an extreme example, suppose you are a Nobel-caliber biologist; you might research T cells and how to treat cancer, just like Tasuku Honjo, who won the prize this time. But if you are a Chinese biologist who loves the Party and the country, according to the theory proposed in the book "Unrestricted Warfare," which the CCP promotes, you should research bacterial and viral warfare, or create a genetic weapon that can only kill Americans and Japanese. Do you think this is alarmist? No, this is a clear strategic idea that the Party has repeatedly reiterated and emphasized in official media.</p>
</details>

如图所示，分别是2014年、2017年、2018年发表在《**中国国防报**》、《**解放军报**》和**军网**上的文章标题，意思是“基因战争将以洗牌方式变革人类战争”、“基因武器如何影响未来战争”、“基因战争笼罩人类的新阴影”。三篇文章都明确提到了需要重视细菌病毒等微生物武器以及人种基因武器的研发工作。最后一篇文章还毫不掩饰地以此为**中共**大范围收集中国人基因的行为而辩护。说白了，党要的是你死我活，是壮大我方实力，打击敌人。

<p class="english-text">As shown in the image, the titles of articles published in "China National Defense News," "PLA Daily," and the PLA Website in 2014, 2017, and 2018, respectively, mean "Genetic warfare will transform human warfare through a reshuffle," "How genetic weapons affect future warfare," and "Genetic warfare casts a new shadow over humanity." All three articles explicitly mention the need to prioritize the research and development of microbial weapons like bacteria and viruses, as well as ethnic genetic weapons. The last article even unreservedly defends the CCP's extensive collection of Chinese genetic data using this premise. In essence, the Party seeks a life-or-death struggle, to strengthen its own power, and to strike at its enemies.</p>
</details>

在这样的指导思想下，每一分的研究经费都需要锚定一个确定的结果，得短期内看得到回报。也就是“我不想冒险去探索创新，因为试错成本太高了。我只想‘解现成’，你们这些傻白甜想着造福全人类，老外在前面蹚，等你们费时费力把错误选项都排除，找到正确的路了，我再来摘取胜利果实，弯道超车，然后利用你们的技术给你们都打趴下。”这种情况下，你身为一个中国的科研人员，又怎么能指望拿诺贝尔奖呢？你想造福全人类，那不等于“资敌”吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Under such guiding ideology, every penny of research funding must be anchored to a definite outcome, with returns visible in the short term. That is, "I don't want to risk exploring innovation because the cost of trial and error is too high. I just want to 'take what's ready-made.' While you naive idealists think about benefiting all humankind, foreigners are paving the way. Once you've spent time and effort eliminating wrong options and found the right path, I'll come and pluck the fruits of victory, overtake you, and then use your technology to defeat you all." In this situation, as a Chinese researcher, how can you expect to win a Nobel Prize? If you want to benefit all humankind, wouldn't that be tantamount to "aiding the enemy"?</p>
</details>

总结一下就是，中国的这种战时体制天然就会抑制创新。注意啊，只是抑制创新，并不抑制改良。类似的规律其实在二战时期的德国表现得就很明显。我们都知道，德国从诺贝尔奖诞生以来就是拿奖大户，从1901年到**希特勒**上台前的1933年，一共产生了32位诺贝尔奖得主，几乎一年一个。而在纳粹掌权的13年间，却一共只拿到了8个诺贝尔奖，其中一个是因揭露纳粹暴行而入狱的和平奖，剩下的7个自然科学类奖项有6个成就都是在纳粹上台之前取得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In summary, China's wartime system inherently suppresses innovation. Note, it suppresses innovation, but not improvement. Similar patterns were quite evident in Germany during World War II. We all know that Germany has been a major recipient of Nobel Prizes since their inception, producing a total of 32 laureates from 1901 until Hitler came to power in 1933, almost one per year. However, during the 13 years of Nazi rule, only 8 Nobel Prizes were awarded, one of which was a Peace Prize for exposing Nazi atrocities, and 6 of the remaining 7 natural science achievements were made before the Nazis came to power.</p>
</details>

其中仅有1944年的**奥托·哈恩**（Otto Hahn: 德国化学家，因发现核裂变而获得诺贝尔化学奖），他拿奖的成就——发现核裂变，是在纳粹时期完成的，并且还主要是出于战争目的。而德国在二战以后十几年间拿到了八座诺贝尔奖，研究成果也基本都是纳粹上台前取得的。也就是说，**希特勒**上台以后，实际上只搞出来了一个诺贝尔奖。相比于战前的一年一座，可以说对比很惨烈了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Among them, only Otto Hahn in 1944, whose award-winning achievement—the discovery of nuclear fission—was completed during the Nazi era, and primarily for wartime purposes. Germany won eight Nobel Prizes in the decade and a half after World War II, and their research achievements were also largely made before the Nazis came to power. In other words, after Hitler came to power, Germany effectively produced only one Nobel Prize. Compared to one per year before the war, the contrast is quite stark.</p>
</details>

当然，按照今天某些人的标准，纳粹时期的德国依然是蒸蒸日上、成就斐然的。不仅加大了科研投入，还造出了远超魏玛时期里程数的高速公路，各种大基建。其他的诸如**V2火箭**（V-2 rocket: 二战时期德国研发的世界上第一种远程弹道导弹）、**V1巡航导弹**（V-1 cruise missile: 二战时期德国研发的世界上第一种巡航导弹）、世界上第一款投入实战的喷气式战斗机、第一款火箭动力飞机、第一款红外夜视仪、史上最重的全封闭装甲战车“鼠式”，也都是能满足某些人虚荣心的所谓“大国重器”。只是这些已经和创新和诺贝尔奖没什么关系了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, by some people's standards today, Nazi Germany was still thriving and achieved remarkable feats. It not only increased research investment but also built highways far exceeding the mileage of the Weimar era, along with various large-scale infrastructure projects. Other achievements, such as the V2 rocket, V1 cruise missile, the world's first jet fighter to see combat, the first rocket-powered aircraft, the first infrared night vision device, and the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle in history, the "Maus," were all so-called "great national instruments" that could satisfy some people's vanity. It's just that these had little to do with innovation and the Nobel Prize.</p>
</details>

事实上，不仅仅是诺贝尔奖，任何不以备战作为评价标准、相对纯粹的学术类奖项，几乎都和中国无缘。相比而言，诺贝尔奖已经算好的了。比如之前讲**魏东义**那期提到过的三大顶级数学奖：**菲尔茨奖**（Fields Medal: 国际数学联盟颁发的数学界最高荣誉之一，常被称为“数学界的诺贝尔奖”）、**阿贝尔奖**（Abel Prize: 挪威政府设立的数学奖项，旨在表彰数学领域的杰出成就）和**沃尔夫奖**（Wolf Prize: 沃尔夫基金会颁发的国际奖项，涵盖科学和艺术领域）。迄今为止，没有任何一个中国人拿过，华裔倒是有几个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, it's not just the Nobel Prize; almost any relatively pure academic award that doesn't use war preparedness as a criterion for evaluation has eluded China. Compared to these, the Nobel Prize is already considered good. For example, the three top mathematics awards mentioned in the previous episode about Wei Dongyi: the Fields Medal, the Abel Prize, and the Wolf Prize. To date, no Chinese national has won any of them, although there have been a few ethnic Chinese recipients.</p>
</details>

要知道，像**菲尔茨奖**是只颁给40岁以下数学家的，几乎可以说你一出成果几年内就能拿奖。这种情况下，你还能拿“滞后效应”当遮羞布吗？数学不行，那其他领域呢？比如顶级的化学奖项**沃尔夫化学奖**、**普利斯特利奖**（Priestley Medal: 美国化学会颁发的最高荣誉，表彰化学领域的杰出服务）。有中国人吗？也没有啊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth noting that the Fields Medal, for example, is only awarded to mathematicians under 40, meaning you can almost certainly win it within a few years of achieving a breakthrough. In such a situation, can you still use the "lag effect" as a fig leaf? If mathematics isn't working, what about other fields? For instance, top chemistry awards like the Wolf Prize in Chemistry and the Priestley Medal. Are there any Chinese recipients? No, there aren't.</p>
</details>

你说西方人戴有色眼镜，那国内信誉比较好的奖项，比如有“东方诺贝尔奖”之称的**邵逸夫奖**，设置了天文学、生命科学和医学以及数学奖，搞了这么多年也没几个中国人啊。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If you claim Westerners are biased, then what about reputable domestic awards, such as the Shaw Prize, known as the "Nobel Prize of the East," which includes awards for Astronomy, Life Science and Medicine, and Mathematical Sciences? After so many years, there are still very few Chinese recipients.</p>
</details>

节目的最后，我想引用两组数据来论证我上面的观点。2024年有日本学者统计了中日两国潜在的诺贝尔候选人的名单。注意啊，这里是按族裔而不是按国籍统计的。需要说明的是，这份名单还是非常准的，像今年拿奖的**板口志文**、**北川进**都赫然在列。这也侧面印证了访谦的一个说法，那就是一个国家每获得一座诺贝尔奖，背后就可能隐藏着几十个诺贝尔奖级别的成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the program, I want to cite two sets of data to support my points above. In 2024, Japanese scholars compiled a list of potential Nobel candidates from China and Japan. Note that this is counted by ethnicity, not by nationality. It's worth mentioning that this list is very accurate; for example, this year's laureates, Tasuku Honjo and Susumu Kitagawa, are prominently featured. This also indirectly confirms a previous statement, which is that for every Nobel Prize a country receives, dozens of Nobel-level achievements might be hidden behind it.</p>
</details>

这份名单中华人候选人有31位，日裔有58人，差距似乎不是很大对吧？但你仔细一看就会发现，日本的这58人除了一个是美国籍以外，其他57人都是日本国籍。而中国的31个人呢，有29个都是外籍或者台湾籍，只有**卢玉明**和**姚七志**是中国国籍。并且卢还是地道的香港人，在香港和英国接受的教育。而姚呢，则是台湾人，毕业于台大，在哈佛拿的博士。也就是说，这31个人没有一个算是真正中国本土培养出来的。所以，到底是中国人不行，还是这片土壤是盐碱地，应该比较明显了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On this list, there are 31 Chinese candidates and 58 Japanese candidates. The gap doesn't seem very large, right? But if you look closely, you'll find that among Japan's 58 candidates, all but one are Japanese nationals. As for China's 31 candidates, 29 are foreign nationals or Taiwanese, with only Lo Yuk-ming and Andrew Yao holding Chinese nationality. Furthermore, Lo is a native Hong Konger who received his education in Hong Kong and the UK. As for Yao, he is Taiwanese, graduated from National Taiwan University, and earned his doctorate at Harvard. In other words, none of these 31 individuals can be considered truly cultivated within mainland China. So, whether it's that Chinese people are not capable, or that this land is barren, should be quite clear.</p>

If you say your country is bad, you can get Nobel Prize. If American writers say America is bad, can they get Nobel Prize? So Nobel Prize is just a joke. It's something that many people hate.
