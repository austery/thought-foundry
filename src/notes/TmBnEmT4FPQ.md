### 引言：诺奖争议与中国的困境

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说，我是夸克。过去的一周，**瑞典皇家科学院**（Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: 负责评选物理学奖和化学奖的机构）陆续公布了本年度的**诺奖**（Nobel Prize: 瑞典皇家科学院根据阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔的遗嘱设立的国际性奖项，旨在表彰在物理学、化学、生理学或医学、文学、和平及经济学领域对人类做出杰出贡献的人士）名单。相比于去年，今年的名单在**简中网络**（Simplified Chinese Internet: 指中国大陆地区使用的互联网平台和内容，与繁体中文网络相对）明显引发了更多讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says, I am Quark. In the past week, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences successively announced this year's Nobel Prize winners. Compared to last year, this year's list clearly sparked more discussion on the Simplified Chinese internet.</p>
</details>

原因也很简单：今年的名单里出现了两位日本科学家的名字，一位是获得了医学奖的板口志文，一位是刚拿了化学奖的北川静。算起来，日本已经总计拿到了32座诺奖，其中光在本世纪，也就是2000年以后获得的就高达24座。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason is simple: this year's list included the names of two Japanese scientists, one being 板口志文 who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and the other being 北川静 who just won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Counting them, Japan has accumulated a total of 32 Nobel Prizes, with 24 of them awarded in this century alone, meaning after the year 2000.</p>
</details>

要知道，2001年日本政府曾经提出要在50年内拿30个诺奖，当时中国官媒曾经不屑一顾，并在报道中用“口出狂言”来形容。如今时间才过了一半，人家的目标已经完成了80%，狂言眼看就要成真了，怎么能不让某些**U型锁**（U-lock: 在中国网络语境中，常指非理性、极端民族主义的行为或言论）们着急上火呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth noting that in 2001, the Japanese government proposed to win 30 Nobel Prizes within 50 years. At that time, Chinese state media dismissed it with disdain, describing it as "boasting" in their reports. Now, only half the time has passed, and their goal is already 80% complete, with the "boasting" seemingly about to come true. How could this not make some "U-lock" nationalists anxious and angry?</p>
</details>

于是乎，简中世界各种声音都出来了：有指责日本人靠公关的，有酸葡萄说诺贝尔奖是西方人的奖，都偏袒自己人，这种奖不拿也罢；还有强行“赢”的说，虽然我们拿不到奖，但一点不耽误我们登月、**六代机**（Sixth-generation fighter: 指第六代战斗机，代表航空技术的最新发展）和**东风导弹**（Dongfeng Missile: 中国人民解放军装备的一系列弹道导弹的统称）啊，等啥时候我们的导弹给美国、欧洲全世界都打服了，他们求着给我们颁奖还来不及呢。以上这几种都属于比较反智的，咱们就不浪费时间介绍了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Consequently, various voices emerged in the Simplified Chinese world: some accused the Japanese of relying on public relations, others sour-graped that the Nobel Prize is a Western award, biased towards their own, and such a prize is not worth winning; there were also those who forcefully claimed victory, saying that even if we don't win prizes, it doesn't hinder our moon landings, sixth-generation fighters, and Dongfeng missiles. When our missiles subdue the US, Europe, and the entire world, they'll be begging to give us awards. The above types are all rather anti-intellectual, so we won't waste time introducing them.</p>
</details>

但与此同时，也有不少人在认真地探讨为什么中国拿诺奖那么难，以及中国的诺贝尔奖什么时候才会爆发。接下来我也会根据自己的理解，谈谈对这两个问题的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at the same time, many people are seriously discussing why it's so difficult for China to win Nobel Prizes and when China's Nobel Prize count will explode. Next, I will also share my understanding of these two questions.</p>
</details>

### 诺奖归属的理性定义与日本的案例

在讨论这些问题之前，咱们得先理性地给个定义，那就是“某国拿诺贝尔奖”这个说法其实不准确的，因为诺奖是颁发给个人的嘛。所以你只能说“拥有某国国籍的人拿诺贝尔奖”，也就是他在得奖时是哪国人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before discussing these issues, we first need to rationally define what "a country winning a Nobel Prize" means, as the Nobel Prize is awarded to individuals. So, you can only say "a person with a certain nationality wins a Nobel Prize," meaning what nationality they held at the time of winning.</p>
</details>

但仅仅只有个国籍也不能证明你这个国家就有多强的教育和科研实力。最典型的例子就是刚和北川静一起获得了诺贝尔化学奖的**奥马尔·亚吉**（Omar Yaghi）。理论上他依然拥有巴勒斯坦的公民权，算是巴勒斯坦人。但一查履历你就会发现，他被看作是巴勒斯坦人唯一的原因是他的父母都是巴勒斯坦难民，而他本人则是在约旦出生的，15岁跟随父母移民到美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, merely possessing a nationality does not prove the strength of that country's education and scientific research capabilities. The most typical example is Omar Yaghi, who just won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry alongside 北川静. Theoretically, he still holds Palestinian citizenship and is considered Palestinian. But upon checking his resume, you'll find that the only reason he's considered Palestinian is that his parents were Palestinian refugees, while he himself was born in Jordan and immigrated to the United States with his parents at age 15.</p>
</details>

他的高中、大学教育以及此后的研究工作都是在美国完成的，他这辈子可能都没去过巴勒斯坦。这种情况下，巴勒斯坦如果站出来宣称亚吉是为国争光、与有荣焉，似乎也有点过于牵强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His high school and university education, as well as his subsequent research work, were all completed in the United States. He may never have even visited Palestine in his life. In this situation, if Palestine were to come forward and claim Yaghi brought honor to the nation and shared in its glory, it would seem a bit far-fetched.</p>
</details>

所以当我们讨论某国拿到诺贝尔奖时，其实包含了三个要素：第一，得奖人得奖时是不是该国国籍；第二，他的主要受教育经历发生在哪个国家；第三，他得奖的研究成果是在哪个国家做出的。其中第二、第三点尤其重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, when we discuss a country winning a Nobel Prize, it actually includes three elements: first, whether the laureate held that country's nationality at the time of winning; second, in which country their main educational experience took place; and third, in which country their award-winning research was conducted. The second and third points are particularly important.</p>
</details>

其实按照这个标准，日本的32座诺奖也要打部分折扣，因为1987和2010年的**利根川进**（Susumu Tonegawa）和**根岸英一**（Ei-ichi Negishi）虽然都还是日本籍，但他们的博士学位和主要研究工作都是在美国完成的。而**南部阳一郎**（Yoichiro Nambu）等三人呢，获奖时已经是美国籍了。至于2017年获得诺贝尔文学奖的**石黑一雄**（Kazuo Ishiguro），则是五岁就已经移居英国，他创作小说时用的也都是英文。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, by this standard, Japan's 32 Nobel Prizes also need to be partially discounted, because Susumu Tonegawa (1987) and Ei-ichi Negishi (2010), while still Japanese nationals, completed their doctoral degrees and main research work in the United States. As for Yoichiro Nambu and two others, they were already American citizens when they received their awards. Kazuo Ishiguro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2017, had moved to the UK at the age of five, and he wrote his novels in English.</p>
</details>

但除开这几位，实实在在由日本培养、在日本做出研究成果、获奖时依然是日本籍的诺奖得主依然有26位。并且南部阳一郎等三人虽然是美国籍，但考虑到他们的博士学位和研究工作都是在日本完成的，也基本上可以算是日本的诺奖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, excluding these individuals, there are still 26 Nobel laureates who were genuinely educated in Japan, conducted their research there, and remained Japanese nationals when they received their awards. Moreover, although Yoichiro Nambu and the other two were American citizens, considering that their doctoral degrees and research work were completed in Japan, they can largely be counted as Japanese Nobel laureates.</p>
</details>

如果按上面这个标准，地地道道“中国制造”的诺奖得主尤其只有**屠呦呦**（Tu Youyou）、**莫言**（Mo Yan）、**刘晓波**（Liu Xiaobo）三位（因为**达赖喇嘛**（Dalai Lama）目前的国籍状况存疑嘛）。这个数量在全球各国排第31位，和白俄罗斯、克罗地亚、墨西哥相当。当然前提是中国承认刘晓波的这个和平奖啊，如果不承认，那就只剩下两座，直接调到38位，和伊朗、巴基斯坦、突尼斯和阿尔及利亚相当了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we apply the above standard, there are only three genuinely "Made in China" Nobel laureates: Tu Youyou, Mo Yan, and Liu Xiaobo (as the current nationality status of the Dalai Lama is questionable). This number ranks 31st among all countries globally, comparable to Belarus, Croatia, and Mexico. Of course, this is on the premise that China recognizes Liu Xiaobo's Peace Prize; if not, there would only be two, dropping directly to 38th place, comparable to Iran, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Algeria.</p>
</details>

如果再考虑到人口规模，那中国毫无疑问是全球人均诺奖数量最少的国家之一。要知道，哪怕是粉红们最看不上的印度也拿了十座。这显然跟墙内某些人一直吹嘘的“中国国力领先美国100年”和“中国人平均智商世界第一”形成了强烈反差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we further consider population size, China is undoubtedly one of the countries with the fewest Nobel Prizes per capita globally. It's worth noting that even India, which many nationalists look down upon, has won ten. This clearly forms a strong contrast with the claims some people within China constantly boast about, such as "China's national strength is 100 years ahead of the US" and "Chinese people have the highest average IQ in the world."</p>
</details>

### 中国诺奖滞后论的争议与反思

关于这一现象，除开粉红说的各种阴谋论以外，常见的解释有这么几种。第一种，可能也是支持者最多的，叫**诺奖滞后论**（Nobel Prize Lag Theory: 一种观点，认为科学研究成果获得诺贝尔奖通常需要较长时间的沉淀和验证，因此中国当前的诺奖数量少是由于过去科研投入不足，未来会迎来爆发）。这种理论认为，诺奖级的成果是需要拿钱砸的，过去中国拿的少是因为穷、底子薄、科研投入少，而中国经济真正开始起飞也就是最近二十几年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding this phenomenon, apart from various conspiracy theories propagated by nationalists, there are several common explanations. The first, and perhaps most widely supported, is the Nobel Prize Lag Theory. This theory suggests that Nobel-level achievements require substantial funding, and China's past low count was due to poverty, a weak foundation, and low research investment. China's economy only truly began to take off in the last two decades or so.</p>
</details>

考虑到诺奖的科学类奖项通常有二十年左右的滞后期，可以预见到2030年以后中国的诺奖数量将会出现井喷。支持这一观点的人还举了日本的例子，因为日本本世纪以来拿到的诺奖大都是上世纪90年代经济腾飞时期的成果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Considering that scientific Nobel Prizes typically have a lag period of about twenty years, it is foreseeable that China's Nobel Prize count will surge after 2030. Proponents of this view also cite Japan's example, as most of the Nobel Prizes Japan has won this century are results from its economic boom in the 1990s.</p>
</details>

需要说明的是，这种理论不是今天才出现的。事实上，每隔几年都会有专家站出来预测说若干年内中国会获得多少多少个诺奖。比如2007年开始，**杨振宁**（Chen-Ning Yang）就在多个场合公开预测过，说10到20年内中国就会有人拿到诺贝尔奖。他说的还算比较保守的，因为也没说拿几个。过了几年，屠呦呦也确实拿了，人家没预测错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth noting that this theory is not new. In fact, every few years, experts come forward to predict how many Nobel Prizes China will win within a certain number of years. For example, starting in 2007, Chen-Ning Yang publicly predicted on multiple occasions that someone in China would win a Nobel Prize within 10 to 20 years. His prediction was relatively conservative, as he didn't specify how many. A few years later, Tu Youyou indeed won, so his prediction wasn't wrong.</p>
</details>

但接下来的预测就比较离谱了。比如2013年，**中科院院士黄维**（Huang Wei）对媒体表示说，十年之内，也就是到2023年，中国人拿诺奖就应该如家常便饭。2015年，首义大学的校长**饶毅**（Rao Yi）也预测说，中国将在2035年以后出现诺奖井喷，到2050年左右诺奖总数将全面超过日本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But subsequent predictions became more outlandish. For example, in 2013, Chinese Academy of Sciences academician Huang Wei told the media that within ten years, meaning by 2023, Chinese people winning Nobel Prizes should become commonplace. In 2015, Rao Yi, president of Shouyi University, also predicted that China would see a surge in Nobel Prizes after 2035, with the total number of Nobel Prizes fully surpassing Japan's by around 2050.</p>
</details>

最夸张的还得属清华高教研究所所长**王小阳**（Wang Xiaoyang），他的看法是到2050年中国可能会出现100个诺奖，秒杀日本。至于中国教育体制扼杀创新导致拿不到诺奖的说法，则完全属于“公知抹黑”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most exaggerated prediction came from Wang Xiaoyang, director of Tsinghua University's Institute of Higher Education, who believed that China might produce 100 Nobel Prizes by 2050, instantly surpassing Japan. As for the argument that China's education system stifles innovation, leading to a lack of Nobel Prizes, he dismissed it as "public intellectual smear."</p>
</details>

以上还是目前网上能查到的，事实上在我的印象里，类似的观点从上世纪八九十年代就开始了。我小的时候媒体的说法是到2000年，就连前学生都做过类似的论断。到我上大学的时候，普遍预测时间又推到了2010年左右，只是因为年代久远，那会儿的信息现在查不到了而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are just what can be found online; in fact, in my memory, similar views began in the 1980s and 1990s. When I was young, the media said it would happen by 2000, and even former students made similar assertions. By the time I went to college, the general prediction was pushed back to around 2010, but because of how long ago it was, that information is now untraceable.</p>
</details>

似乎你只要不停地把这个井喷时间往后推，牛皮就能一直吹下去。反正聊的都是20年以后的事，那会儿年轻人还有几个记得并且跟你翻旧账较真呢？没准网上都查不到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seems that as long as you keep pushing back the "surge" date, the boast can continue indefinitely. After all, we're talking about things 20 years from now; how many young people will remember and hold you accountable then? Maybe the information won't even be traceable online anymore.</p>
</details>

### 制度论：教育与学术氛围的深层问题

除开这种有点自欺欺人的诺奖滞后论，另一种制度论则显得更加务实。这种理论认为，中国人拿诺奖难最根本的原因还在于中国的教育制度和学术氛围很大程度上抑制着创新。更具体的说，诺奖更看重基础科学和技术的原创性，而这些研究成果具有相当程度的偶然性，只有好奇心驱动、忍得住寂寞、愿意坐冷板凳的科研人员才有可能成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Aside from this somewhat self-deceptive Nobel Prize lag theory, another institutional theory appears more pragmatic. This theory posits that the fundamental reason for China's difficulty in winning Nobel Prizes lies in its education system and academic atmosphere, which largely suppress innovation. More specifically, the Nobel Prize places greater emphasis on originality in basic science and technology, and these research achievements possess a considerable degree of serendipity. Only researchers driven by curiosity, capable of enduring solitude, and willing to undertake long-term, unglamorous work are likely to succeed.</p>
</details>

而中国的情况是从义务教育阶段开始就扼杀学生的好奇心，灌输标准答案，崇尚实用主义。到了科研阶段，考核标准更是严重的功利导向，比如之前聊过的**飞升即走**（Fly-and-Go: 形容科研人员在获得晋升或达到一定目标后，迅速离开现有职位或研究方向的现象，暗示功利主义和短期行为），要晋升就必须在顶级期刊发多少篇论文等等，以至于搞出了一个庞大的付费发论文的产业链。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In China, however, from the compulsory education stage, students' curiosity is stifled, standard answers are instilled, and pragmatism is glorified. At the research stage, assessment criteria are severely utilitarian-oriented. For example, as discussed before, the "fly-and-go" phenomenon means that to get promoted, one must publish a certain number of papers in top journals, leading to a massive industry for paid paper publication.</p>
</details>

这相当于鼓励所有的研究人员都扎堆去搞那些热门、容易出成果的方向，和学术精神背道而驰了。再有就是学术领域严重的官僚风气，比如一篇论文十几二十个作者，真正做出贡献的人反而排在导师后面。再比如70%的科研经费都是竞争性的，课题的平均周期不超过三年，支撑不了需要长期沉淀的重大项目等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This effectively encourages all researchers to flock to popular, easily achievable research areas, which runs counter to the spirit of academia. Furthermore, there's a severe bureaucratic atmosphere in academia, for instance, a paper having fifteen to twenty authors, with the truly contributing individuals ranked behind their supervisors. Another example is that 70% of research funding is competitive, with an average project cycle not exceeding three years, which cannot support major projects requiring long-term dedication.</p>
</details>

以上这些观点有道理吗？有，但似乎还有一点流于表面，因为它描述的更多是现象而不是背后的成因。接下来就说说我自己的观点，也就是为什么中国的学术和研究氛围会呈现出这种急功近利的取向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are these points valid? Yes, but they seem a bit superficial, as they describe phenomena more than underlying causes. Next, I will share my own perspective on why China's academic and research environment exhibits such a utilitarian and short-sighted orientation.</p>
</details>

### 诺贝尔奖的设立宗旨与评选标准

在阐述观点前，我们需要先了解诺贝尔奖是干嘛的，它的评奖标准是什么。根据诺奖官网上的解释，诺贝尔奖是根据**阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔**（Alfred Nobel）先生的遗嘱设立的，它最高的核心标准是对人类做出最大的贡献。注意这个定语啊，是为人类做出最大贡献，而不是为某个国家、某个政权或者某个政党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before elaborating on my views, we need to understand what the Nobel Prize is for and what its judging criteria are. According to the explanation on the Nobel Prize official website, the Nobel Prize was established based on the will of Mr. Alfred Nobel, and its highest core standard is to make the greatest contribution to humanity. Note this qualifier: it is to make the greatest contribution to humanity, not to a specific country, regime, or political party.</p>
</details>

所以墙内经常有人讨论什么**钱学森**（Qian Xuesen）、**邓稼先**（Deng Jiaxian）贡献那么大凭什么拿不到一个诺奖，甚至有人夸张地表示“不是钱学森拿不到诺奖，而是诺奖配不上钱学森”。这都属于是笑料了啊，因为钱、邓干的事儿不过是为**中共**（Chinese Communist Party）党卫军添砖加瓦，唯一的贡献就是帮助巩固党的独裁统治，防止老百姓造反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, people inside China often discuss why figures like Qian Xuesen and Deng Jiaxian, despite their immense contributions, didn't receive a Nobel Prize. Some even exaggeratedly claim, "It's not that Qian Xuesen couldn't win a Nobel Prize, but that the Nobel Prize isn't worthy of Qian Xuesen." These are all jokes, because what Qian and Deng did was merely to add bricks and tiles to the CCP's party army, with their sole contribution being to help consolidate the Party's dictatorial rule and prevent the populace from rebelling.</p>
</details>

这类所谓“伟大贡献”的研究人员，每个中国人民的“老朋友”国家都有：苏联有造原子弹的**库尔恰托夫**（Igor Kurchatov）和造氢弹的**萨哈罗夫**（Andrei Sakharov）；朝鲜有核弹之父**徐向国**；巴基斯坦有**阿卜杜拉·卡迪尔·汉**（Abdul Qadeer Khan）；伊朗有**法赫里扎德**（Mohsen Fakhrizadeh）。钱学森、邓稼先和那些人并没有什么不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every "old friend" country of the Chinese people has researchers with such so-called "great contributions": the Soviet Union had Igor Kurchatov, who built the atomic bomb, and Andrei Sakharov, who built the hydrogen bomb; North Korea has its nuclear father Xu Xiangguo; Pakistan has Abdul Qadeer Khan; and Iran has Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Qian Xuesen, Deng Jiaxian, and those individuals are no different.</p>
</details>

按这个标准，别说以上这几位，哪怕最早搞出了原子弹的**奥本海默**（J. Robert Oppenheimer）也是没资格得奖的。事实上，从有诺奖以来，就没有任何一个科学家是因为研发出了某种武器而得奖，甚至获得提名的，因为这和诺奖设立的初衷就不符嘛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By this standard, let alone the aforementioned individuals, even J. Robert Oppenheimer, who first developed the atomic bomb, would not be eligible for the award. In fact, since the inception of the Nobel Prize, no scientist has ever won or even been nominated for developing a weapon, because it goes against the original intent of the Nobel Prize.</p>
</details>

其次是瑞典皇家科学院给出的学术性解释：诺贝尔奖主要奖励的是概念性的飞跃而非单纯的技术应用，也就是那些带来知识上的突破、根本性的改变人类对世界认知的发现或者发明。从这个角度来说，很多粉红津津乐道的中国教科书上的那些所谓“伟大成就”，比如什么人工合成**牛胰岛素**（Bovine insulin: 从牛体内提取的胰岛素，用于糖尿病治疗）、**侯德榜**（Hou Debang）的联合制碱法等等，离诺奖都差了十万八千里，因为它们不仅远远够不上改变人类对世界的认知，连原创性的技术运用也都算不上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Secondly, there's the academic explanation provided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: the Nobel Prize primarily rewards conceptual leaps rather than mere technological applications, meaning discoveries or inventions that bring about breakthroughs in knowledge and fundamentally change humanity's understanding of the world. From this perspective, many of the so-called "great achievements" lauded by nationalists in Chinese textbooks, such as the artificial synthesis of bovine insulin or Hou Debang's combined soda ash process, are miles away from Nobel-level work. This is because they not only fall far short of changing humanity's understanding of the world but also cannot even be considered original technological applications.</p>
</details>

比如最早研究并确定了胰岛素分子结构的是英国科学家**弗雷德里克·桑格**（Frederick Sanger），他也因此获得了1958年的诺贝尔化学奖。而那项中国中学生都熟知的成果，完整名称应该是“首次体外人工合成具有生物活性的结晶牛胰岛素”。“体外人工合成”和“具有生物活性”是两个重要的定语，因为它既不是第一个体外人工合成的胰岛素，也不是科学家获得的第一个有活性的胰岛素，只是众多的按照桑格给出的分子式在实验室里合成的胰岛素之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For instance, the first to research and determine the molecular structure of insulin was the British scientist Frederick Sanger, who consequently received the 1958 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The achievement familiar to Chinese middle school students should be fully named "the first in vitro artificial synthesis of biologically active crystalline bovine insulin." "In vitro artificial synthesis" and "biologically active" are two important qualifiers, because it was neither the first insulin synthesized in vitro, nor the first active insulin obtained by scientists; it was merely one of many insulins synthesized in the laboratory according to Sanger's molecular formula.</p>
</details>

除了中国合成的牛胰岛素，还有美、德等国家合成的**猪胰岛素**（Porcine insulin: 从猪体内提取的胰岛素）和**人胰岛素**（Human insulin: 通过基因工程技术生产的胰岛素，与人体自身胰岛素结构相同）等等。并且中国的这项技术在获得成功后很快就被淘汰，也从未投入量产，可以说没能产生任何的实际影响。唯一的影响大概就是被写进教科书，在对背景掐头去尾的情况下增强了几代中国孩子的民族自豪感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Besides the bovine insulin synthesized in China, there were also porcine insulin and human insulin synthesized in countries like the US and Germany. Moreover, this Chinese technology was quickly phased out after its success and never put into mass production, arguably failing to produce any practical impact. Its only impact was probably being written into textbooks, enhancing the national pride of several generations of Chinese children by omitting crucial background details.</p>
</details>

侯德榜的**侯氏制碱法**（Hou's process for soda ash: 中国化学家侯德榜发明的一种联合生产纯碱和氯化铵的工艺）也是一样，它既不是世界上最早的制碱法，也不是今天最主流的制碱法，而只是对比利时化学家**索尔维**（Ernest Solvay）的**氨碱法**（Solvay process: 一种工业生产碳酸钠（纯碱）的方法）的改良法之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hou Debang's Hou's process for soda ash is also similar; it is neither the world's earliest soda ash production method nor today's most mainstream one, but merely one of several improvements upon the Solvay process developed by the Belgian chemist Ernest Solvay.</p>
</details>

了解了以上这些信息，你就明白为什么中国作为全球第一制造大国，号称每年的专利和论文数遥遥领先，却很难拿到诺奖的原因了。因为粉红心目中最能彰显中国强大的那些成就，都只能算是改进型的技术应用。

<p class="english-text">Understanding this information, you'll comprehend why China, as the world's largest manufacturing nation, claiming to lead in annual patent and paper counts, finds it difficult to win Nobel Prizes. This is because the achievements that nationalists believe best showcase China's strength can only be considered improved technological applications.</p>
</details>

不信你盘点一下所有经常被国人拿出来显摆、津津乐道的成就，从所谓的“国之重器”什么两弹一星、航母、六代机、登月、空间站、无人机，到民生领域的所谓“新四大发明”，也就是高铁、网购、移动支付和共享单车，这里有哪个改变了人类对世界的认知？又有哪个发明是原创的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you don't believe it, take stock of all the achievements frequently flaunted and praised by Chinese people, from the so-called "pillars of the nation" like the Two Bombs and One Satellite, aircraft carriers, sixth-generation fighters, moon landings, space stations, and drones, to the so-called "new four great inventions" in daily life—high-speed rail, online shopping, mobile payments, and shared bicycles. Which of these has changed humanity's understanding of the world? And which invention is truly original?</p>
</details>

这里不是说应用就不重要，而是你得正视一个客观事实：中国的长项从来不是原创，而是成本控制，也就是围绕一个人家已经发明出来的东西降本增效，通过低人群优势和市场规模把成本打下来，建立起低成本可商用的供应链。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This isn't to say that applications aren't important, but you must face an objective fact: China's strength has never been in originality, but in cost control. This means reducing costs and increasing efficiency around something already invented by others, bringing down costs through a large population advantage and market scale, and establishing a low-cost, commercially viable supply chain.</p>
</details>

比如国人引以为傲的新能源和光伏发电，新能源的核心**锂电池**（Lithium battery: 一种可充电电池，广泛应用于电子设备和电动汽车）是日本科学家**吉野章**（Akira Yoshino）发明的，光伏发电的核心技术是美国**贝尔实验室**（Bell Labs: 著名的美国工业研究和科学开发公司）的三位科学家上世纪50年代搞出来的，都不是什么新技术。中国唯一的优势是造得更便宜，但诺贝尔奖显然不是为了造得更便宜而设立的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For example, the new energy and photovoltaic power generation that Chinese people are proud of: the core lithium battery for new energy was invented by Japanese scientist Akira Yoshino, and the core technology for photovoltaic power generation was developed by three scientists at America's Bell Labs in the 1950s—none of these are new technologies. China's only advantage is making things cheaper, but the Nobel Prize was clearly not established for making things cheaper.</p>
</details>

### 中国“战时思维”对科研创新的抑制

那中国为什么就不能在“造得更便宜”之外，也重视一下原创或者基础性的理论研究呢？要知道，在过去的三年间，中国的研发投入一直位列全球第二，科研资金占GDP的比重也高达2.58%，位列全球第12位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why can't China, besides "making things cheaper," also prioritize original or fundamental theoretical research? It's worth noting that over the past three years, China's R&D investment has consistently ranked second globally, with research funding accounting for 2.58% of its GDP, placing it 12th worldwide.</p>
</details>

根本的原因可能在于，从1949年建政到现在，中国一直就是个围绕战时思维打造的国家。所谓“战时思维”是一种在面对极端生存挑战或者重大危机时被激活和主导的思维模式，它最主要的特点是目标唯一化，也就是把所有的复杂问题简化为一个核心目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fundamental reason might be that since its founding in 1949, China has consistently been a nation built around a wartime mindset. The so-called "wartime mindset" is a mode of thinking activated and dominated when facing extreme survival challenges or major crises. Its primary characteristic is goal singularization, meaning simplifying all complex problems into one core objective.</p>
</details>

举个例子啊，我很喜欢玩那种模拟经营类的游戏。玩过这类的游戏的朋友都知道，建设一个城市或者国家其实是很复杂的，需要盯着一大堆不同的目标参数，比如城市建设、商业繁荣度、科技发展、宗教建筑、民主指数、新闻及言论自由、军事力量等等等等。而这些目标之间往往存在着一定的排斥性，因为你的资源就那么多嘛，多建一个军事建筑就少一个宗教建筑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, I really enjoy playing simulation management games. Friends who have played these types of games know that building a city or a nation is quite complex, requiring attention to a multitude of different objective parameters, such as urban development, commercial prosperity, technological advancement, religious buildings, democracy index, freedom of the press and speech, military strength, and so on. These objectives often have certain incompatibilities, because your resources are finite; building one more military structure means one less religious building.</p>
</details>

成熟的玩家往往要在这一大堆目标之间搞平衡，才能建立起一个整体上高水平的文明。而这种平衡的艺术跟现实生活其实是很像的，民主国家的政客制定政策时也得综合考虑，不能围绕单一或者极少数的几个目标转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Experienced players often need to strike a balance among this multitude of objectives to build a civilization that is high-level overall. This art of balancing is actually very similar to real life; politicians in democratic countries must also consider various factors when formulating policies, not just revolve around a single or very few objectives.</p>
</details>

但战时思维就不同了，它会把整个社会所有人的诉求简化成一个目标，那就是打赢这场战争。为了这个目标，什么人权、言论自由、物质生活水平都得靠边站，一切为发展军事力量服务。本来在战争年代你这么做也无可厚非，但问题是，类似中国这样的国家会把战争的概念泛化，从而实现战时思维的常态化。说人话就是：任何时候都是战时，都要按照战时标准来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But wartime thinking is different; it simplifies the demands of everyone in society into one goal: winning the war. For this goal, human rights, freedom of speech, and material living standards all take a backseat; everything serves the development of military power. In wartime, doing this is understandable, but the problem is that countries like China generalize the concept of war, thereby normalizing wartime thinking. In plain language, this means: it's always wartime, and everything must be done according to wartime standards.</p>
</details>

这么说可能有点抽象，我举个例子。**顾维钧**（V.K. Wellington Koo）大家都知道吧，就是那个在巴黎和会上拒绝签字，1945年又代表中华民国参加旧金山会议签署了**联合国**（United Nations）宪章的那位民国第一外交官。1948年，中共在**人民日报**（People's Daily）上公布了第一批43人的所谓“内战战犯名单”，顾维钧位列第22位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This might sound a bit abstract, so let me give an example. Everyone knows V.K. Wellington Koo, right? He was the Republic of China's top diplomat who refused to sign at the Paris Peace Conference and later represented the Republic of China at the San Francisco Conference in 1945 to sign the United Nations Charter. In 1948, the CCP published its first list of 43 so-called "civil war criminals" in the People's Daily, with V.K. Wellington Koo ranked 22nd.</p>
</details>

49年以后，顾维钧跟着老蒋去了台湾，后来又去了**海牙国际法院**（International Court of Justice in The Hague）做副院长，退休以后在美国定居。1972年，出席联大会议的中共代表团成员**张寒之**（Zhang Hanzhi），也就是**陈凯歌**（Chen Kaige）前妻**洪晃**（Hung Huang）她妈，受**毛泽东**（Mao Zedong）的委托去拜访顾维钧，邀请他回中国看看。顾说：“我是毛泽东点名的战犯，回去批判我吗？”张寒之赶忙解释说：“那是非常时期。”顾笑着回答：“贵党何时不是非常时期？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After 1949, V.K. Wellington Koo followed Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan, then went on to serve as Vice President of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and settled in the United States after retirement. In 1972, Zhang Hanzhi, a member of the CCP delegation attending the UN General Assembly—who is also Hung Huang's mother and Chen Kaige's ex-wife—was tasked by Mao Zedong to visit V.K. Wellington Koo and invite him to visit China. Koo asked, "I'm a war criminal named by Mao Zedong; will I be criticized if I go back?" Zhang Hanzhi quickly explained, "That was an extraordinary period." Koo smiled and replied, "When has your party not been in an extraordinary period?"</p>
</details>

顾维钧的这个回答其实就一语道破了天机。我在之前的节目里曾经提到过，共产党的本质其实就是一种通过持续制造仇恨来维持内部凝聚力，从而为独裁统治创造正当性的这么一个意识形态。这种仇恨既包括对外也包括对内。对外的表现形式就是备战备荒，随时准备打世界大战；对内就是大清洗。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">V.K. Wellington Koo's response actually revealed the crucial truth. I've mentioned in previous shows that the essence of the Communist Party is an ideology that maintains internal cohesion by continuously manufacturing hatred, thereby creating legitimacy for its authoritarian rule. This hatred includes both external and internal targets. Externally, it manifests as preparing for war and famine, always ready for a world war; internally, it's about purges.</p>
</details>

所以对党而言，确保整个社会长期保持高水平的仇恨度和战争氛围是至关重要的。只有大家都相信“帝国主义亡我之心不死”，你才能搞战时那一套，压制所有不同的声音。如果国内国外都和平了，你还有什么理由搞独裁、拒绝民主化呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, for the Party, ensuring that society maintains a high level of hatred and a wartime atmosphere over the long term is crucial. Only when everyone believes that "imperialism is bent on destroying us" can you implement wartime measures and suppress all dissenting voices. If both domestic and international situations are peaceful, what reason would you have to maintain dictatorship and refuse democratization?</p>
</details>

不信你想想，哪怕在所谓的“改开时期”，非军队系统中共的官媒上是不是依然会频繁地出现以下这类用语：外交上他们说“斗争精神”、“敢于亮剑”、“底线思维”、“反华势力”；社会治理上他们说“重拳出击”、“铁腕整治”、“扫黑除恶”、“围剿围堵”、“网格化管理”、“拉网式排查”；宣传领域他们说“守住舆论主阵地”、“主战场”、“构筑思想防线”、“抢占意识形态高地”、“敢于斗争”、“善于斗争”、“巩固扩大战果”、“夺取最后胜利”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you don't believe it, consider whether even during the so-called "reform and opening-up period," the CCP's official media outside the military system frequently used the following types of language: in diplomacy, they spoke of "fighting spirit," "daring to draw the sword," "bottom-line thinking," and "anti-China forces"; in social governance, they spoke of "heavy-handed crackdown," "iron-fisted rectification," "cracking down on gangs and evil," "encirclement and suppression," "grid management," and "comprehensive screening"; in propaganda, they spoke of "holding the main front of public opinion," "main battlefield," "building ideological defenses," "seizing the high ground of ideology," "daring to struggle," "being good at struggle," "consolidating and expanding achievements," and "achieving final victory."</p>
</details>

在经济和科研领域，他们会说“遏制和打压”、“防止卡脖子”、“打破技术封锁”、“攻坚克难”、“突围”、“破局”、“亲自挂帅”、“啃硬骨头”。哪怕是在疫情期间，他们也还会说“大国战役打响”、“疫情防控阻击战”、“保卫战”、“白衣战士”、“总指挥”、“请战书”、“人民战争”、“社会总动员”。这种无处不在的战争术语，其实目的只有一个，就是潜移默化培养中国人的战争思维，以便在有需要时能够迅速切换到战时状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the economic and scientific research fields, they would speak of "containment and suppression," "preventing chokeholds," "breaking technological blockades," "overcoming difficulties," "breaking through," "breaking the deadlock," "personally leading," and "tackling tough challenges." Even during the pandemic, they would still say things like "a great nation's battle has begun," "epidemic prevention and control battle," "defense battle," "white-clad warriors," "commander-in-chief," "letters of challenge," "people's war," and "total social mobilization." The pervasive use of such wartime terminology has only one goal: to subtly cultivate a wartime mindset among Chinese people, so that they can quickly switch to a wartime state when needed.</p>
</details>

理解了这个背景，你就能明白为什么整个中国社会从上到下都会如此地推崇效率而忽略程序正义和法治建设，强调中央集权和所谓的“集中力量办大事”，把底线思维和国家安全挂在嘴边，鼓吹集体主义和牺牲精神。你也能理解咱们前面的问题，为什么中国的科研这么急功近利了。因为这些都是战时思维的延伸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Understanding this background, you can comprehend why the entire Chinese society, from top to bottom, so highly values efficiency while neglecting procedural justice and the rule of law, emphasizes central authority and the so-called "concentrating resources to accomplish big tasks," constantly talks about bottom-line thinking and national security, and advocates collectivism and a spirit of sacrifice. You can also understand our earlier question: why is China's scientific research so utilitarian and short-sighted? Because these are all extensions of wartime thinking.</p>
</details>

一切为了打仗，或者说准备打仗。一个处于和平时期的国家的科学家，他的驱动力是什么？是求知、探索世界、研究怎么造福全人类，对吧？这也是诺奖的初衷。而一个处于战时的科学家呢，他会被要求什么？一切以本国利益为重，你搞科研的唯一目标就是为了打赢接下来这场战争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everything is for war, or rather, preparing for war. What is the driving force of a scientist in a peaceful country? It's the pursuit of knowledge, exploring the world, and researching how to benefit all humanity, right? This is also the original intention of the Nobel Prize. And what is demanded of a scientist in wartime? Everything must prioritize national interests; your sole goal in scientific research is to win the upcoming war.</p>
</details>

你可以研发武器，研发让人士兵感觉不到疲惫的药物，也可以搞出科技产品帮助政府出口创收，增加国防开支。总之，你的KPI就是帮助本国政府打击敌对国，而不是什么造福全人类或者满足自己的好奇心。

<details>

</details>

举个极端的例子，假设你是个诺奖型的生物学家，你可能会研究T细胞和如何治疗癌症，就像这次拿奖的板口志文那样。但如果你是个爱党爱国的中国生物学家，按照中共推崇的**《超限战》**（Unrestricted Warfare: 中国军方理论家乔良和王湘穗于1999年出版的一本书，提出超越传统战争界限，利用一切手段（包括非军事手段）打击敌人的战略思想）一书中提出的理论，你应该去研究细菌病毒战，或者创造出一种只能杀死美国人和日本人的基因武器。

<p class="english-text">To give an extreme example, suppose you are a Nobel-caliber biologist. You might research T cells and how to treat cancer, like 板口志文 who won this time.

</details>

你以为这是危言耸听吗？不，这是党在官方媒体上多次重申和强调的清晰的战略思路。如图所示，分别是2014年、17年、18年发表在**中国国防报**（China National Defense News）、**解放军报**（PLA Daily）和**军网**（China Military Online）上的文章标题，意思是“基因战争将以洗牌方式变革人类战争”、“基因武器如何影响未来战争”、“基因战争笼罩人类的新阴影”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think this is alarmist? No, this is a clear strategic idea repeatedly reiterated and emphasized by the Party in official media. As shown in the image, these are article titles published in 2014, 2017, and 2018 in the China National Defense News, PLA Daily, and China Military Online, meaning "Genetic Warfare Will Reshuffle and Transform Human Warfare," "How Genetic Weapons Affect Future Warfare," and "The New Shadow of Genetic Warfare Looming Over Humanity."</p>
</details>

三篇文章都明确提到了需要重视细菌病毒等微生物武器以及人种基因武器的研发工作。最后一篇文章还毫不掩饰地以此为中共大范围收集中国人基因的行为而辩护。说白了，党要的是你死我活，是壮大我方实力，打击敌人。

<p class="english-text">All three articles explicitly mentioned the need to prioritize the research and development of microbial weapons like bacteria and viruses, as well as ethnic genetic weapons. The last article even unreservedly defended the CCP's extensive collection of Chinese genetic data based on this. In essence, the Party wants a life-and-death struggle, to strengthen its own power, and strike at enemies.</p>
</details>

在这样的指导思想下，每一分的研究经费都需要锚定一个确定的结果，得短期内看得到回报。也就是我不想冒险去探索创新，因为试错成本太高了。我只想“解现成”，你们这些傻白甜想着造福全人类，老外在前面蹚，等你们费时费力把错误选项都排除，找到正确的路了，我再来摘取胜利果实，弯道超车，然后利用你们的技术给你们都打趴下。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Under such guiding ideology, every penny of research funding must be tied to a definite outcome, with returns visible in the short term. This means I don't want to risk exploring innovation because the cost of trial and error is too high. I just want to "take what's ready-made." While you naive idealists think about benefiting all humanity, foreigners are paving the way. Once you've spent time and effort eliminating wrong options and found the right path, I'll come and pluck the fruits of victory, overtake you, and then use your technology to beat you all down.</p>
</details>

这种情况下，你身为一个中国的科研人员，又怎么能指望拿诺贝尔奖呢？你想造福全人类，那不等于“资敌”吗？总结一下就是，中国的这种战时体制天然就会抑制创新，注意啊，只是抑制创新，并不抑制改良。

</details>

### 历史对比：纳粹德国的科研启示

类似的规律其实在二战时期的德国表现得就很明显。我们都知道，德国从诺奖诞生以来就是拿奖大户，从1901年到希特勒上台前的1933年，一共产生了32位诺奖得主，几乎一年一个。而在纳粹掌权的13年间，却一共只拿到了8个诺奖。其中一个是因揭露纳粹暴行而入狱的和平奖，剩下的7个自然科学类奖项有6个成就都是在纳粹上台之前取得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Similar patterns were actually quite evident in Germany during World War II. As we all know, Germany has been a major recipient of Nobel Prizes since their inception, producing a total of 32 laureates from 1901 until Hitler came to power in 1933, almost one per year. However, during the 13 years of Nazi rule, only 8 Nobel Prizes were awarded. One of these was a Peace Prize for exposing Nazi atrocities, and 6 of the remaining 7 natural science awards were for achievements made before the Nazis came to power.</p>
</details>

其中仅有1944年的**奥托·哈恩**（Otto Hahn），他拿奖的成就——发现核裂变——是在纳粹时期完成的，并且还主要是出于战争目的。而德国在二战以后十几年间拿到了八座诺奖，研究成果也基本都是纳粹上台前取得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Only Otto Hahn in 1944, whose award-winning achievement—the discovery of nuclear fission—was completed during the Nazi era, and primarily for wartime purposes. Germany won eight Nobel Prizes in the decade and a half after World War II, and these research achievements were also largely made before the Nazis came to power.</p>
</details>

也就是说，希特勒上台以后，实际上只搞出来了一个诺奖。相比于战前的一年一座，可以说对比很惨烈了。当然，按照今天某些人的标准，纳粹时期的德国依然是蒸蒸日上、成就斐然的，不仅加大了科研投入，还造出了远超**魏玛时期**（Weimar Republic: 德国在1918年至1933年间的共和制政府）里程数的高速公路，各种大基建。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words, after Hitler came to power, effectively only one Nobel Prize was produced. Compared to the pre-war rate of one per year, the contrast is quite stark. Of course, by some people's standards today, Nazi Germany was still flourishing and achieving greatly, not only increasing research investment but also building far more miles of highways than during the Weimar period, along with various large-scale infrastructure projects.</p>
</details>

其他的诸如**V2火箭**（V-2 Rocket: 纳粹德国在二战期间研发的弹道导弹）、**V1巡航导弹**（V-1 Cruise Missile: 纳粹德国在二战期间研发的早期巡航导弹）、世界上第一款投入实战的**喷气式战斗机**（Jet fighter: 使用喷气发动机的战斗机）、第一款**火箭动力飞机**（Rocket-powered aircraft: 使用火箭发动机作为动力的飞机）、第一款**红外夜视仪**（Infrared night vision device: 利用红外线进行夜间观察的设备）、史上最重的**全封闭装甲战车**（Fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle: 指完全封闭的重型装甲战斗车辆）属实也都是能满足某些人虚荣心的所谓“大国重器”，只是这些已经和创新和诺奖没什么关系了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other achievements, such as the V2 rocket, V1 cruise missile, the world's first combat-deployed jet fighter, the first rocket-powered aircraft, the first infrared night vision device, and the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle in history, were indeed "great national instruments" that could satisfy some people's vanity, but these had little to do with innovation and the Nobel Prize.</p>
</details>

事实上，不仅仅是诺奖，任何不以备战作为评价标准、相对纯粹的学术类奖项，几乎都和中国无缘。相比而言，诺奖已经算好的了。比如之前讲**魏东义**（Wei Dongyi）那期提到过的三大顶级数学奖：**菲尔茨奖**（Fields Medal: 国际数学联盟颁发的数学奖项，被视为数学界的最高荣誉之一，每四年颁发一次，授予40岁以下的杰出数学家）、**阿贝尔奖**（Abel Prize: 挪威政府设立的国际性数学奖项，旨在表彰在数学领域做出杰出贡献的数学家）和**沃尔夫奖**（Wolf Prize: 沃尔夫基金会颁发的国际性奖项，涵盖农业、化学、数学、医学、物理学和艺术领域，被认为是诺贝尔奖之外最重要的科学奖项之一），迄今为止没有任何一个中国人拿过，华裔倒是有几个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, it's not just the Nobel Prize; almost any relatively pure academic award that doesn't use war preparedness as a criterion for evaluation has eluded China. In comparison, the Nobel Prize is already considered good. For example, the three top mathematics awards mentioned in the previous episode about Wei Dongyi: the Fields Medal, the Abel Prize, and the Wolf Prize—no Chinese person has ever won any of them to date, though there have been a few of Chinese descent.</p>
</details>

要知道，像菲尔茨奖是只颁给40岁以下数学家的，几乎可以说你一出成果几年内就能拿奖。这种情况下，你还能拿滞后效应当遮羞布吗？数学不行，那其他领域呢？比如顶级的化学奖项**沃尔夫化学奖**（Wolf Prize in Chemistry: 沃尔夫奖在化学领域的奖项）和**普利斯特利奖**（Priestley Medal: 美国化学会授予的最高荣誉，表彰在化学领域做出杰出贡献的科学家），有中国人吗？也没有啊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth noting that the Fields Medal, for instance, is only awarded to mathematicians under 40, meaning you could almost win it within a few years of achieving a breakthrough.

For example, top chemistry awards like the Wolf Prize in Chemistry and the Priestley Medal, are there any Chinese recipients? No, there aren't.</p>
</details>

你说西方人戴有色眼镜，那国内信誉比较好的奖项，比如有“东方诺贝尔奖”之称的**邵逸夫奖**（Shaw Prize: 由香港邵逸夫奖基金会设立的国际性奖项，旨在表彰在天文学、生命科学与医学、数学科学领域取得突破性成就的科学家，被誉为“东方诺贝尔奖”），设置了天文学、生命科学与医学以及数学奖，搞了这么多年也没几个中国人啊。

</details>

### 结论：中国科研的未来与挑战

节目的最后，我想引用两组数据来论证我上面的观点。2024年有日本学者统计了中日两国潜在的诺贝尔候选人的名单。注意啊，这里是按族裔而不是按国籍统计的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the program, I want to cite two sets of data to support my points above. In 2024, Japanese scholars compiled a list of potential Nobel candidates from China and Japan. Note that this is counted by ethnicity, not by nationality.</p>
</details>

需要说明的是，这份名单还是非常准的，像今年拿奖的板口志文、北川静都赫然在列。这也侧面印证了坊间的一个说法，那就是一个国家每获得一座诺奖，背后就可能隐藏着几十个诺奖级别的成就。这份名单中华人候选人有31位，日裔有58人，差距似乎不是很大对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's worth noting that this list is very accurate, with 板口志文 and 北川静, who won this year, prominently featured. This also indirectly confirms a common saying that for every Nobel Prize a country wins, dozens of Nobel-level achievements might be hidden behind it. In this list, there are 31 Chinese candidates and 58 Japanese candidates; the gap doesn't seem very large, does it?</p>
</details>

但你仔细一看就会发现，日本的这58人除了一个是美国籍以外，其他57人都是日本国籍。而中国的31个人呢，有29个都是外籍或者台湾籍，只有**卢玉明**（Lu Yuming）和**姚期智**（Andrew Yao）是中国国籍。并且卢还是地道的香港人，在香港和英国接受的教育。而姚呢，则是台湾人，毕业于台大，在哈佛拿的博士。也就是说，这31个人没有一个算是真正中国本土培养出来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you look closely, you'll find that among Japan's 58 individuals, all but one are Japanese nationals. As for China's 31 individuals, 29 are foreign nationals or Taiwanese, with only Lu Yuming and Andrew Yao holding Chinese nationality. Furthermore, Lu is a native Hong Konger who received his education in Hong Kong and the UK. And Yao is Taiwanese, graduated from National Taiwan University, and earned his PhD from Harvard. In other words, not a single one of these 31 individuals can be considered truly cultivated within mainland China.</p>
</details>

所以到底是“中国人不行”还是“这片土壤是**盐碱地**”（Saline-alkali land: 原指土壤贫瘠不适合耕种的土地，在此引申为不适合创新和人才成长的环境），应该比较明显了。If you say your country is bad, you can get Nobel Prize. If American writers say America is bad, can they get Nobel Prize? So Nobel Prize is just a joke. It's something that many people hate.

<p class="english-text">So, whether it's "Chinese people are incapable" or "this land is barren," should be quite clear. If you say your country is bad, you can get Nobel Prize.
