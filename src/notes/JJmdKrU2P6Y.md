title: 特斯拉2025年Q3财报解读：盈利未达预期，但AI、机器人与自动驾驶的未来愿景支撑股价
summary: 特斯拉公布了2025年第三季度财报，营收超出预期，但每股收益（EPS）未达标。尽管财报数据喜忧参半，股价反应相对平稳。CEO埃隆·马斯克在电话会议中强调了公司在真实世界AI领域的领导地位，并描绘了全自动驾驶（FSD）、擎天柱（Optimus）机器人和储能业务的宏大蓝图。他将FSD的进展视为扩大产能的关键，并称Optimus有望成为史上最伟大的产品。本次财报会议的核心在于特斯拉如何平衡短期盈利压力与长期颠覆性技术的投入。

### 市场动荡：中美贸易紧张局势引发抛售

Amit：好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的《收盘观察》节目。我们正在直播，抱歉我迟到了一会儿，但我们已经准备就绪。今天有很多内容要谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. I'm sorry I'm a little late, but we are good to go. We've got a lot of stuff to talk about today.</p>
</details>

Amit：显然，今天股市可以说经历了一个相当艰难的日子。自最低点以来，我们经历了一点V型反弹。标普500指数下跌，但没有盘中那么糟糕。我们收于667点，盘中一度跌至663点，这也是为什么很多股票最终有所回升的原因。然后，我们还有特斯拉的财报，将在12分钟后公布。我们将看看特斯拉会发生什么，并讨论一下今天市场为何出现小幅下跌。我需要有人来帮我分析，女士们先生们，有请Jose先生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Obviously, it's been a pretty rough day in the stock market to say the least. We've had a little bit of a V-bounce since the very lows. So S&P 500 is down. It's not down as bad as it was during the middle of the day. We're at 667. We got all the way down to 663, which is why a lot of names ended up recovering just a little bit. And then we got Tesla earnings. We got Tesla earnings in 12 minutes. We're going to see what happens with Tesla. We're going to talk about why the market took a little bit of a dump today. And I need someone to help me out. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Jose.</p>
</details>

Jose：V，你好吗？一切都好吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: What's going on, V? How's everything?</p>
</details>

Amit：一切都好。今天市场可以说相当有趣。第一个问题问你：你今天抄底了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: It's going good. It's been a quite a fun day in the markets to say the least. Um, first question for you. Did you buy any dip today?</p>
</details>

Jose：我卖出了Nebas的看跌期权，基本上就这些了。但我没有真正购买任何纯股票。还没有。如果这是市场的转折点，我会很高兴。如果不是，我也对我做的小操作感到满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: Um, I sold the puts on Nebas. That's pretty much it. But haven't really purchased any pure stock. Not just yet. If this is the turnaround, I'm happy. If it's not, I'm also happy with the little things I did.</p>
</details>

Amit：好的，我今天去“购物”了。我进行了一些小额买入，这是我买入的价格：Palantir 172.38美元。我三周前在171美元买过Palantir，所以我想，好吧，只高了1美元。Nvidia 177.5美元，我自159美元以来就没碰过Nvidia，这是第一次。SoFi，我完成了我说过要买的500股，如果我不买，人们会杀了我的。SoFi的平均成本是26.88美元。当然，我们还买了点Grabby Grab，5.55美元。所以，全面进行了一些小额买入。市场情绪达到了极度恐惧，所以在那时我就想，“好吧，至少小额买入一点可能是值得的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, so I went shopping. I went shopping. This is what I did. These are little nibbles, but these are the prices. Palantir 172.38. Bought Palantir 171 like three weeks ago. So I'm like, all right, it's a dollar up. Nvidia 177.5. I've not touched Nvidia since 159. This is the first time for Nvidia. SoFi. I finished the 500 shares that I said I was going to buy, and if I didn't, people would have killed me. 26.88. That's the average on SoFi. And then, of course, we had to do Grabby Grab. So, 5.55 on Grabby Grab. So, little nibbles across the board. We got to extreme fear. So, at that point, I was just like, "All right, it probably is worth at least nibbling a bit."</p>
</details>

Amit：我不知道我们是否已经走出困境，也不知道情况会如何变化。我们在最后大约50分钟确实出现了一个V型反弹，现在我们处于恐惧或极度恐惧的边缘，但情况没有之前那么糟糕了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I don't know if we're out of the woods. I don't know how this is going to change. We did get a V-shape towards like basically the last 50 minutes, and now we are just at fear or on the edge of extreme fear. but it's not as bad as as it was before.</p>
</details>

Amit：那么，发生这种情况的原因是什么？然后我们再谈特斯拉。今天我没有看到太多原因。我确实看到一个头条新闻，这可能是主要原因。这是一份路透社在12:30左右发布的报道：特朗普政府正在考虑一项计划，限制全球生产的、使用或含有美国软件的产品对中国的出口。新的出口管制可能会限制各种商品对中国的出口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Now, what is the reason for why this is happening and then we're going to get into Tesla. I didn't see a ton of reasons today. I did get one headline that could be kind of the the main argument. This was a Reuters report that came out around 12:30. Trump administration considering a plan to restrict globally produced exports to China made with or containing US software. New export controls could curb exports on wide range of goods to China.</p>
</details>

Amit：这似乎是核心论点，即任何使用美国软件在全球生产的商品和服务——我认为很多东西都是用美国软件创造的——都将受到出口管制。显然，这是一种非常激进的出口管制，其整个想法是为了对抗中国对稀土矿物的出口管制。我们将拭目以待。特朗普还发推文说，他将对从巴西进口的牛征收50%的关税。我不知道这是否真的导致了市场暴跌，但在路透社发布那条中国出口管制的传闻之后，这无疑是火上浇油。所以我认为，将这两件事结合起来，再加上我们正在经历的十月份普遍的震荡行情，这就是你看到市场有所回调的原因，也是我们今天所经历的一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: It seems like that was the core argument that anything that's created with US software in terms of globally produced goods and services which I think is a lot of stuff created with US software that would have an export control. Now obviously this is a very aggressive export control and the whole idea is to go against China's export controls against rare earth minerals. We're going to see what happens. Trump also tweeted that he is going to be tariffing cattle from Brazil for 50%. I don't know if that really tanked the market, but that definitely added fuel to the fire after that China export control rumor that Reuters put out. And so I think you put those two together along with just a general choppy October that we're dealing with. That's why you had a little bit of a draw down. And that's some of the pain that I think we're experiencing today.</p>
</details>

Jose：你知道，这很疯狂。我记得上周四还是周五，我在这里说过，我对市场感到不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: And you know, it's crazy. I think I was on here, I don't know if it was Thursday or or or Friday last week. I forget what day it was, but it was late last week, and I was telling you how I was feeling unease of the market.</p>
</details>

Jose：是的。感觉很疯狂，我的投资组合在过去几天里显然遭受了重创，但现在我感觉好多了。就像一个巨大的负担被卸下了。虽然这显然很糟糕，但我现在对市场感到更兴奋一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: Yes. It's crazy to feel that my portfolio obviously has taken quite a hit in the past few days, but like I feel so much better now. It's like a a a big lift has been lifted. I mean it's obviously sucks, but I feel a little bit more excited about the market now.</p>
</details>

Amit：我百分之百同意，也希望聊天室里的朋友们能分享他们的看法。我认为像Oklo这样当天仍下跌15%，或者像D-Wave这样下跌14%的股票，很多这类股票本周下跌了约30%到40%。说到底，它们需要被洗盘。它们需要被清理出去。看到稀土矿物股一路飙升是不健康的，它们当天都下跌了7%到8%。我认为这实际上为我们下一轮上涨提供了一个很好的起点，或者说一个很好的机会，前提是我们能有非常好的财报。问题就在于，我们能得到一些好的财报吗？今天我们将通过特斯拉来观察。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Well, I 1,000% agree and I would love people in the in the chat to kind of give their perspective on this as well. I think that some of these names like an Oklo that's still down 15% on a day, like a D-Wave that is down 14% on a day. A lot of these names down about 30 to 40% for the week. At the end of the day, they needed to get flushed out. They needed to get flushed out. It was not healthy to see rare earth mineral stocks just go to the moon. All of them down 7 to 8% on the day. And I think it actually gives us a really good leg up for the or a really good opportunity to take the next leg up if we could have really good earnings. It's just a question of, you know, can we get some good earnings? And today we're going to see with Tesla.</p>
</details>

Amit：在谈论特斯拉之前，我想说的最后一件事是，这些动量股中，很多都没有任何基本面支撑，甚至不接受股东提问。像谷歌这样的公司，如果经历几个糟糕的月份，他们可以通过一份出色的季度报告来扭转局面。但这些动量股，这次回调最糟糕的部分在于，如果他们在财报上没有什么可报告的，财报也救不了它们。事实上，像VRT这样一家财报超出预期20%、业绩非常出色的公司，其股价当天也只是勉强收绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Before we talk about Tesla, one last thing I want to say is some of these momentum stocks again, they don't have any fundamentals. A lot of them don't even take shareholder questions. So Google, if it has a couple bad months, they can have a blowout quarter. Things change these momentum names. And the worst part about this draw down is that if they don't have anything to report on earnings, earnings is not going to save them. In fact, a company like VRT that beat earnings by 20% had, you know, phenomenal earnings, this stock is barely green on the day.</p>
</details>

Amit：对于那些财报良好都无法上涨的股票，我只能想象那些没什么可说的公司会发生什么。然后，另一个结构性分析是，如果势头消退，人们不想成为最后的接盘侠，那么谁会留下来？顺便说一下，说到接盘，Beyond Meat早上还是7.50美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: So stocks that can't even go green on good earnings. I can only imagine what would happen to some of those names that have nothing to say. And then the other sort of structural analysis around this is that if momentum dies out and people don't want to be left holding the bag, you know who's left? By the way, speaking of holding a bag, Beyond Meat, this was $7.50 in the morning.</p>
</details>

Amit：现在又回到了3.50美元。Jose，对素食主义者占领世界有什么看法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: It's back to 350. Jose, any thoughts on the vegans of the world taking over?</p>
</details>

Jose：不，我的意思是，当你看到这些股票上涨100%时，这很疯狂。恭喜那些能够赚钱或进行交易的人。但对于那些试图玩这场激烈游戏的接盘侠来说，这确实很糟糕。这就是我通常不参与的原因。我不喜欢亏钱，而且我通常不擅长把握时机。所以我可能会成为有史以来最差的交易员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: No, I mean, it's crazy when when you see some of these stocks of 100%. I mean, congrats to those that are able to to make the the bucks or or trade with it. Uh, but it definitely sucks for for the backholders that uh that try to play this game, which is is pretty intense. That's why I typically don't play. I'm not a fan of of losing money and and usually I'm bad at at timing things. So, I would probably be the worst trader ever.</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，我认为成熟的标志就是意识到，如果你错过了入场时机，你可能就不应该追高，因为当事情发展到那一步时，不会有太多好事发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yes. I think maturing is realizing that if you miss the the timing on the entry, then you probably shouldn't be chasing it because not that many good things can happen when when it goes that route.</p>
</details>

### 特斯拉财报前瞻：AI与未来业务成焦点

Amit：好的，关于特斯拉是涨是跌的投票正在聊天室进行。我们还有七分钟就能拿到数据了。Jose，给我你最直接的想法。特斯拉在人工智能领域是一家重要的公司。你认为我们能期待什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Pump or dump poll is live in the chat for Tesla. We got seven minutes until we get the numbers. I mean, Jose, give me your raw thoughts. Tesla's an important company in the world of AI. What do you think we can expect?</p>
</details>

Jose：我非常期待听到埃隆或他的团队多谈谈人工智能创新。我看到一条评论是关于AI的，我想甚至是针对我的，问“特斯拉真的是一家AI公司吗？”我确实相信它是。**FSD**（Full Self-Driving: 特斯拉开发的先进驾驶辅助系统，目标是实现完全无需人类干预的自动驾驶）是有史以来最伟大的东西。我每次开车都会打开它。新版本不断地表现出色。他们有自己的半导体团队来开发自己的芯片。他们为自己的平台建立了大规模的数据中心，当然也独立为XAI建立了数据中心。他们还建立了自己的AI基础设施。所以，我其实不太关心汽车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: Uh, I mean, I definitely love to hear when Elon or the team talks a little bit more about the AI innovations. I saw one of the comments coming in through AI I think it was even directed towards me was like, is Tesla really an AI company? I really do believe it is. I mean, it's it's definitely FSD is the greatest thing ever. I mean I every time I drive I turn that baby on. The new version just continues to kill it. I mean they have their own semiconductor Tim team to develop their own chips. They build massive data centers within the obviously ex uh in independently for XAI but for their own platforms. They also kind of built their own form of AI infrastructure as well. So I mean this I could care less about the cars.</p>
</details>

Jose：显然，现在的财报数字都和汽车有关，但我想从埃隆那里听到更多关于AI领域、能源领域正在发生的事情。显然，通过他们的能源收入，我们可以了解这方面的进展情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: Obviously, the numbers right now is all about the cars, but I want to hear more from Elon about what's happening here in the AI space, what's happening here in the energy space, obviously with their energy revenue. We can get some sentiment of how that's progressing.</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，我同意。现在已经不再仅仅是汽车业务了。显然，关键在于特斯拉世界里其他所有事情会如何发展。正如你所见，特斯拉预计的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 衡量公司盈利能力的关键财务指标）是56美分。如果我没记错的话，这仍然会同比下降约15%到20%。营收预计为267亿美元。所以，华尔街对同比增长率的质量并不十分乐观。但他们认为，如果特斯拉能超过这些数字，那么这些预期也就不算太差了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, I agree. It's not about the the auto business anymore. Obviously, it's about what's going to happen with everything else going on in the world of Tesla. Tesla right here, as you can see, 56 cents EPS expected. That would still be down, if I'm not wrong, about 15 to 20% year-over-year. And in revenue, 26.7 billion. So again, the street's not super optimistic on the quality of numbers in terms of the year-over-year growth rates. Um, but they are thinking that, you know, maybe if Tesla can beat these numbers, then those expectations would not be that bad.</p>
</details>

Amit：我想问问观众。特斯拉现在的股价是439美元。你持有特斯拉吗？如果你想透露持股数量和平均成本，可以在聊天室里分享。我知道聊天室里可能有一些特斯拉的“老炮”。大家认为哪个指标会决定股价的涨跌？是埃隆说了什么话让它上涨，还是特斯拉在某个方面严重失误导致下跌？我很想知道大家的看法。顺便说一下，在我的聊天室里，57%的人认为是“跌”。所以有相当一部分人对此并不兴奋。Jose，如果你要猜是涨是跌，你会倾向于哪一边？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Here's the question to the audience. Tesla right there at 439. Do you own Tesla? And if you want to disclose how many shares, your average, you can just put it in the chat. We'll highlight some of the people that are in here. I know there's probably some Tesla OGs that are in the chat, but I mean, what do people think is going to be the metric that either dumps the stock or pumps the stock? Is it going to be something Elon says that pumps it, or is it going to be something that, you know, Tesla really misses on badly theoretically that could dump it? I'd be very curious to see what a lot of people think. By the way, in my chat, 57% of people say dump. So, we got a decent amount of people that are not that excited about it. Uh, Jose, if you had to guess pump or dump, I mean, what side would you lean on towards?</p>
</details>

Jose：我不知道。我总是猜错，但这次我要说，我感觉特斯拉的财报会带来一点上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: I I don't know. Again, I'm always wrong, but I'm going to say here, I'm feeling like a little pump here on on Tesla for earnings.</p>
</details>

Amit：你只是想争取群众的支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: You're just trying to get the crowd on your side. You're just trying to get the crowd on your side.</p>
</details>

Jose：不，不，因为我不知道我是否刚刚说了反话，所以他们会讨厌我。但有一件事我觉得很有趣，回到核心业务上，他们在前几个季度谈到过要发布一款更便宜的车型，以便让更多客户能够负担得起，他们在这个季度确实做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: No, no, cuz I don't know if I just jinxed it. Uh, so so they're going to hate me. Um, but I mean for one thing that I I I do find interesting kind of going back to the core business is one thing that they've talked about in prior quarters was that they were going to release a cheaper model um in form of of uh to have more accessible uh to more customers and they did do that this quarter.</p>
</details>

Jose：我不知道这是否是本季度的一部分，但他们至少在过去几周内发布了它。我的问题是，我不知道分析师是否会回答这个问题，但这真的是一个真实的产品吗？显然，它是一个真实的产品，他们已经推出了。但它只是为了让股东高兴，说“看，我们做到了”的产品，还是他们真的有市场机会？因为它便宜了大约5000美元，但你失去了很多东西。所以我不认为他们会直接说，“啊，这只是为了让股东高兴。”但我好奇的是，一些分析师是否会施加压力，问：你们真的看到了对那个标准版的需求，还是仅仅因为你们承诺了一款更便宜的车型？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: I don't know was a part of this quarter but uh they did at least release it within the past few few weeks and my question I I wonder if analysis is going to answer this is is this actually a real product. Obviously, it's a real product, so we they have it there. But is it a product that is just meant to make shareholders happy to say, "Look, we did it." Or do they have an actual market opportunity with this as it's about $5,000 cheaper, but you're losing off so many things. So, I don't think they're going to just say, "Ah, it's just to make the shareholders happy." But I wonder if some analysts are going to put some pressure of like, what was are you really seeing demand for that standard version or was it just something because you promised a cheaper model?</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，我认为很多人，包括我自己，都对那款更便宜车型的推出方式感到有些失望，因为它并没有便宜那么多。但也许埃隆可以对此做出一些澄清，这可能会改变很多人的看法。顺便说一下，朋友们，我本以为今天对特斯拉来说会是糟糕的一天，但现在看来还不错。看看SoFi从26美元涨到27美元。标普指数只下跌了0.5%，最糟糕时曾下跌1.5%。Nvidia从176美元涨到180美元。特斯拉曾跌至429美元，现在是439美元。Palantir从171美元涨到175美元。Hoodie从120美元涨到127美元。Grab从5.40美元涨到5.61美元。Meta当天基本持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, and I think a lot of people were a bit disappointed, including myself, with how the roll out of that cheaper model came out because it just wasn't that much cheaper. But maybe Elon can give some clarity there and that could change a lot of these perspectives. By the way, folks, I mean, I thought it would be a crappy day for Tesla to report. It's kind of turning into an okay day. Look at SoFi 26 to 27. S&P only down half a percent. It was down 1.5 at the worst. Nvidia 176 to 180. Tesla got to 429, now 439. Palantir 171 to 175. Hoodie 120 it touched to 127. You got grabbed from 540 to 561. Meta's basically flat on the day.</p>
</details>

Amit：Amazon仍然下跌，Salesforce也小幅下跌。但看起来算法交易又开始变得乐观一些了。我确实认为，我们盘中看到的回调更多是算法驱动的，因为似乎没有太多的基本面原因。如果我们能从特斯拉开始获得一些好的财报，那肯定会有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Amazon still down 21797. Salesforce down a little bit. But it looks like the algos are getting back to be a bit more optimistic and again I do think it was more algorithmic when we saw the draw down intraday because there just didn't seem to be that much of a fundamental reason. If we can get some good earnings starting with Tesla that could definitely help.</p>
</details>

Amit：我们还有半导体领域的Lamb Research。我们还有IBM，IBM一直在研究量子计算。谷歌今天宣布了在量子计算机上的突破。埃隆实际上回应了桑达尔关于他们量子算法突破的言论。埃隆说：“恭喜。看来量子计算正在变得重要。”所以埃隆和桑达尔理论上都看好量子计算。量子股并没有因为这些评论而大涨，因为它们仍然受到动量股回调的冲击。但这里确实有一些催化剂让市场兴奋起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: We also have Lamb Research in the semiconductor space. We have IBM. You know, IBM's been working on quantum computing. Google announced a breakthrough on quantum computers today. Elon actually responded to what Sundar said about their breakthrough on their quantum algorithm. And uh Elon said, "Congrats. Look like quantum computing is becoming relevant." So, you got Elon and Sundar that are theoretically bullish quantum. The quantum stocks really didn't take off on these comments because they're they're just still getting hit from the momentum drawdown. Uh but you do have some catalyst right here getting the market excited.</p>
</details>

Amit：然后还有Kinder Morgan，Crown Castle，软件领域的SAP，当然还有特斯拉，我们将看看会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Then you have Kinder Morgan. You have Crown Castle, SAP, and the software world. And then obviously you have Tesla and we're gonna see what happens there.</p>
</details>

Jose：是的，Lamb Research会非常有趣。我们已经有ASML公布了财报，它也属于设备领域，所以在整体市场上与Lamb Research相似。台积电也已经提到他们将增加其资本支出范围的下限。所以，Lamb Research在先进封装和涉及HBM的内存领域有更多帮助。所以我对此很兴奋。我没有持有它，但我希望Lamb Research能有一个很棒的电话会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: Yeah, Lamb Research will be pretty interesting. I mean we already had ASML report earnings which is in the equipment space. So similar to Lamb Research in terms of overall market and TSN kind of already mentioned that they were going to see increment in their bottom range of capital expenditure. So uh Lamb Research definitely helps a little bit more in advanced packaging and in the memory space which is dealing with HBM. Uh, so I'm excited there. I don't own it, but uh I'm hoping for a great call from Lamb Research there.</p>
</details>

### 财报揭晓：营收超预期，盈利未达标

Amit：好的，我们来了。系好安全带。我们有一堆财报要看。我想电话会议是5:30，所以我们有大约一个半小时来剖析所有这些结果，尽可能多地进行分析。财报幻灯片可能会在15分钟内出来，而结果可能会在4:05左右出来，所以我们可能要等五分钟。但我们将看看结果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, here we go. Buckle up. We got a bunch of earnings. I think the calls at 5:30, so we got about an hour and a half to dissect all these results, get as much analysis as we can. The deck's probably going to come out in 15 minutes.

Amit：今天真是疯狂的一天。Triple V，谢谢你的200美元超级留言，也谢谢你来到这里。由于市场的起伏，以及它的波动性和令人揪心的程度，今天甚至感觉不像特斯拉的财报日。但它确实是特斯拉财报日，特斯拉的财报将正式拉开第三季度大型科技公司财报的序幕。女士们，先生们，感谢你们的到来。10月22日，星期三，下午4点，股市现已收盘。

<p class="english-text">Amit: It's crazy because today's been a wild day across the board. Triple V, thank you for the $200 super chat. Thank you for being here. And it doesn't even feel like it's Tesla earnings day because of the ups and downs of the market and how just volatile and gut-wrenching it's been up or down, but it is Tesla earnings and Tesla earnings will officially be starting off big tech earnings for Q3. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here. Wednesday, October 22nd, 4 p.m. The stock market is now closed.</p>

Amit：好了，今天常规交易时段结束了。现在我们可以看看这些财报结果会如何。特斯拉收盘价为438美元，下跌约1%。Nvidia，基本上没什么变化，当天仅下跌0.5%。Palantir下跌3%，Hoodie下跌3.5%。很多这些股票都是一起下跌，然后又在同一时间一起回升。AMD从224美元涨到230美元。SoFi收于27美元。Grab实际上收于5.60美元，对Grab来说还不错。

<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, we are done for the day. We are done for the day, at least for the regular hours. And now we get to see what happens with these results. Tesla ends the day at 438, down about 1%. Nvidia, I mean, basically a nothing burger. Barely down half a percent on the day. Palantir was down 3%. Hoodie down 3.5. A lot of these names, they all went down together and then they came back up together at the same time. AMD from 224 to 230. SoFi 27 on the close. Grab actually got a 560 close. Not too bad for Grab.</p>

</details>

Amit：我认为股价从330美元涨到430美元，连我都没预料到，我认为这是因为埃隆的薪酬方案和他购买了价值10亿美元的股票。所以我真的不知道公司会说些什么来让股价如此兴奋。我不知道。我真的不知道。但我确实认为他们不必下跌，我只是觉得他们也不必一飞冲天。

<p class="english-text">Amit: I think the stock moving from 330 to 430 even I didn't expect that and I think that was because the Elon compensation package and him buying a billion dollars worth of stock.

And so, and if there is, I think that's the wild card. I think people get really excited. If not, then yeah, I don't know what we're going to see.</p>
</details>

Jose：我不知道是不是这个季度，我们看到一些文章说，他们承诺的Optimus数量实际上会低很多。所以我好奇在问答环节是否会有人提到这个问题，他们提到第一年大约一千台，但一些报告说会比这个数字低得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jose: I I don't know if it was this quarter where we saw a few articles that um the numbers that they promised were actually are are actually going to be a lot lower.

</details>

Amit：是的。他说到2030年他会生产一百万台。所以，这只是很多雄心勃勃的目标。我希望他能宣布沃尔玛订购了10万个机器人。你知道，如果亚马逊昨天刚发布一份报告说他们正在考虑用机器人取代60万名员工，那么理论上沃尔玛或联邦快递的需求应该是存在的。埃隆应该能够达成某种协议，即使现在还没有真正的收入，并使其成为实质性进展。但我认为，这才会真正让华尔街将其纳入他们的估值模型。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. You said he would do a million by like 2030. So I mean it's just a lot of ambitious targets. I want him to announce Walmart ordered 100,000 robots. You know, if Amazon just put out a report yesterday saying they're thinking of getting rid of 600,000 humans for robots, then theoretically the demand should be there from a Walmart or a FedEx or like Elon should be able to get somewhat of an agreement even if it's not real revenue yet and and make it material. But, you know, that's what I think would actually get the street to put it into their valuation models.</p>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Oh, no. I got it. Tesla missed. Missed by 11% on EPS. Uh 50 cents versus 56 cents expected. So, that is a miss. Revenue. They beat revenue they beat by 5%.</p>
</details>

Amit：一个失误和一个超出。哇，他们居然在EPS上失手了。上次他们只差了2%，这次是11%。50美分对56美分，280.9亿美元对267亿美元。所以营收超出了13亿美元。EPS同比下降31%，没有盈利增长，是负增长。营收至少增长了12%。所以你确实有一些营收增长，但EPS下降了。股价下跌至431美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: A miss and a beat. A miss and a beat. Wow. They actually missed on EPS. I mean, even last time they had a little bit better of a I think they only missed by 2% this time 11%. 50 cents versus 56 cents, 28.09 billion versus 26.7. So, you do have a uh basically 1.3 billion beat. EPS is down 31% year-over-year, no earnings growth, negative earnings growth. Revenue at least is up 12%. So, you do have some revenue growth, but EPS is down. The stock goes red 431.</p>

Amit：说句公道话，它只下跌了1.3%。我的意思是，这甚至不算激进，对吧？这正是我过去几天一直预测的，它不必大幅下跌，但也不必大幅上涨。我认为每个特斯拉股东如果股价没有暴跌就应该感到非常高兴，因为有人可能会说，它在过去几周上涨那么多可能并没有什么理由。正如你在股价上看到的，你并没有真正看到上涨或下跌的走势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: To be fair though, it's down 1.3%. Like I mean it's it's not even it's not even kind of aggressive, right? And this is kind of what I've been predicting for the past couple days that it doesn't have to go down a lot, but it doesn't have to go up a lot. I think every Tesla shareholder should be really happy if it just doesn't tank because one could argue there might not have been a reason for it to go up as much as it did over the past couple weeks. And as you can see on the stock, you're not really getting a move up or down.</p>
</details>

Amit：也许业绩指引会提振股价。我们等等财报幻灯片，应该马上就出来了，然后我们会分析数据。但除了指引或埃隆说些好话之外，我没想到他们会错过EPS。我真的以为他们会在EPS上符合预期。但结果就是这样。

</details>

新闻播报：特斯拉的营收超出预期，但利润未达标。公司营收为281亿美元，好于预期的263.6亿美元，但每股收益为50美分，华尔街预期为55美分。所以虽然不是大幅未达标，但仍然是未达标。我们将回顾这些数据，希望我们能得到更多关于未来计划、未来义务以及投资者在机器人出租车、自动驾驶汽车开发等方面所寻求的具体细节。

<p class="english-text">News Anchor: Morgan, it is a beat on the top line and a miss on the bottom line for Tesla. The company bringing in revenue better than expected 28.1 billion. The street was expecting 26.36 billion, but EPS comes in at 50 cents a share. 50-0 50 cents a share. The street was expecting 55 cents a share. So, not a huge miss, but it is a miss nonetheless. We're going to go back through the numbers, guys. Hopefully, we'll get some more details in terms of uh future plans, future obligations, and the kind of concrete details that investors are looking for when it comes to things like robo taxi, autonomous vehicle development, etc.</p>

### 深入解读财报：利润率、现金流与未来展望

Amit：好的，我们来看看这些数据。特斯拉第三季度营收281亿美元，预期266亿。EPS为50美分。自由现金流39亿美元，预期12.5亿。所以他们在自由现金流上超出了预期。毛利率18%，预期17.2%。他们在毛利率上也超出了预期。这实际上比我想象的要好得多。营业收入16.2亿美元，预期16.5亿。他们在营业收入上未达预期，这可能也是他们净利润未达预期的原因。然后整体EPS再次低于预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, let's get into some of these numbers. So, this is what we've got on Tesla. Third quarter revenue 28.1 versus 26.6. Uh EPS50s. Free cash flow 3.9 versus 1.25 billion. So they did beat on free cash flow. Gross margin 18% versus 17.2. They did beat on those gross margins. That is actually way better than I thought. Operating income 1.62 versus 1.65. They missed on operating income. Probably why they missed on uh net income as well. And then overall EPS again was lower than expected for Tessy.</p>
</details>

Amit：所以他们利润率超预期，营业收入未达预期，自由现金流大幅超预期。那些积分可能帮助了他们的自由现金流。

<details>

</details>

Amit：好的，我们来看看财报文件。首先读一下他们的信，他们的小结，然后再继续。好的，这里是。在第三季度，特斯拉团队实现了全球创纪录的汽车交付量，显示了所有地区的强劲实力和增长，同时在住宅、工业和公用事业领域也实现了创纪录的储能部署。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, let's pull up the deck and let's pull this out. Okay. So, let's first of all read their letter, their their small summary, and then we'll keep going from there. Okay, here we go. In Q3, the Tesla team achieved record vehicle deliveries globally, showing C strength and growth across all regions while also achieving record energy storage deployments across the residential, industry, and utility utility sectors.</p>
</details>

Amit：强劲的业绩带来了创纪录的季度收入和自由现金流。我们继续推出令客户兴奋的汽车和能源新产品。我们推出了Model Y L和Model Y Performance，并用我们最实惠的车型Model 3和Model Y Standard进一步扩大了我们的产品线。我们还推出了**Mega Pac**（Megapack: 特斯拉生产的大型商用储能电池系统） 3和Mega Block，这将通过降低成本和部署时间进一步简化大型电池的安装。

We are prudently making the necessary investments in our business, including future business lines that we believe will drive incredible value for Tesla and the world across transport, energy, and robotics.</p>
</details>

Jose：我的意思是，总收入有了很好的改善，对吧？第二季度是220亿美元，第一季度是190亿美元。而这个季度他们做了280亿美元。所以，不确定是不是每个人都在积分结束前抢购那些汽车，但收入增长确实有了很好的回升，你甚至在汽车部门也看到了同比增长。

Um but there was definitely a nice pickup in in revenue growth where you even saw a year-over-year growth in the automotive segment as well.</p>
</details>

Amit：是的，能源服务和汽车交付量的增加都有帮助。他们说，我们的营业收入下降了40%，导致营业利润率为5.8%。原因是**SBC**（Stock-Based Compensation: 公司以自身股票作为奖励支付给员工的费用）、较低的积分、较低的一次性FSD收入确认、由于较低的固定成本吸收导致的单位车辆平均成本上升，以及运营费用的增加。这些都是任何企业都必须处理的典型问题，但对特斯拉来说，这个季度的情况更为严峻。这就是为什么营业收入没有一些人预期的那么强劲。股价现在是438美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah, energy services uh increase in vehicle deliveries that helped. They said our operating income decreased 40% resulting in a 5.8% operating margin. The reason was because of SBC, lower credits, lower onetime FSD revenue recognition, higher average cost per vehicle due to lower fixed cost absorption absorption, and an increase in operating expenses. So, kind of the typical things any business would have to deal with, but they were a bit more aggressive this quarter for Tesla. And that's why that operating income came in just not as strong as some people expected. 438 is what you've got on the stock.</p>

### 埃隆·马斯克电话会议核心要点

Elon Musk：谢谢。我们正处于特斯拉及其未来战略的关键转折点，我们将人工智能带入现实世界。我认为强调特斯拉确实是现实世界人工智能的领导者非常重要。没有人能做到我们能做到的。我对人工智能有相当好的洞察力，我认为特斯拉在汽车中拥有所有AI中最高的智能密度，而且只会越来越好。

#### 真实世界AI与全自动驾驶的“冲击波”

Elon Musk：我们实际上才刚刚开始大规模推广全自动驾驶和机器人出租车，这将从根本上改变交通的性质。我认为人们还没有完全意识到这将以何种程度起飞。老实说，它将像一股冲击波。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: Um, and we're really just at the beginning of scaling at a at a quite massively full self-driving and robo taxi and fundamentally changing the nature of transport. I think people just don't don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will uh take off. um where that that that it's honestly it's going to be like a shock wave.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：因为所有的汽车都已经上路了。我们有数百万辆汽车，通过一次软件更新就能变成全自动驾驶汽车。我们每年生产大约两百万辆。事实上，随着我们现在对实现无监督全自动驾驶的清晰认识，我有信心扩大特斯拉的生产。所以，我们的意图是尽快扩大我们未来的生产。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: Um so it's it's a you cuz the cars are all out there. there. You know, we have millions of cars out there that with a software update become um full self-driving cars and um and you know, we're making a couple million a year um and and and in fact with the advent of with with what we see now as as a clarity on achieving full self-driving, unsupervised full self-driving I should say, um I feel confident in expanding Tesla's production. Um, so that is that is our intent to expand as quickly as we can our future production.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：在实现无监督全自动驾驶之前，我一直不愿意这样做。但现在，我觉得我们已经有了清晰的认识，尽快扩大生产是合理的。

</details>

Elon Musk：我们还在能源领域产生了巨大影响，通过电池储能，包括Powerwall，尤其是Megapack。我们正在显著提高从电网产生更多能源的能力。让我稍微谈谈这一点，如果你看看美国总的能源能力，美国大约有1太瓦的持续电力供应，但24小时周期内的平均使用量只有0.5太瓦，因为白天和晚上的用电量差异很大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: uh we're also making huge uh um make making huge impact on the energy sector with uh with with battery storage. So with both the power wall um and especially with the mega pack uh we are dramatically improving the ability to um generate more energy from the grid. Let me sort of talk a little bit about that which is if if you look at total US energy um capability for example there's roughly a terowatt of of of continuous power available in the US but the average usage over a 24-hour cycle is only half a terowatt because of the big difference between day and night usage.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：如果你用电池来缓冲能量，你可以在不增加任何发电厂的情况下，仅用电池就能有效地将美国的能源输出翻倍。而建设发电厂非常困难，需要很长时间，有很多审批，而且这个行业不习惯快速行动。所以我们看到了特斯拉电池组的潜力，可以极大地提高任何给定电网（美国或其他地方）的年能源输出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: um if you buffer that buffer the energy with batteries, you can effectively double the energy output in the United States just with batteries building no incremental power plants. Um and it's very difficult to build power plants. So they take a long time. There's a lot of permitting and it's not an industry that's used to moving fast. So we see the potential there for Tesla battery packs uh to greatly improve the um the energy output per year for any given grid US or otherwise.</p>
</details>

#### 擎天柱机器人：史上最伟大的产品？

Elon Musk：我们也在Optimus项目上处于一个真正巨大的突破边缘，我认为它很可能或者有潜力成为有史以来最伟大的产品。这是一个困难的项目，值得注意的是，这并非轻而易举。我不知道福特、通用或任何美国汽车公司有任何机器人项目。人们可能认为特斯拉是一家汽车公司，我们主要生产汽车和电池组，但制造Optimus并非显而易见、信手拈来的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: Um, we're also on the cusp of of something really tremendous with Optimus, um, which I think uh, is likely to be or has potential to be the biggest product of all time. Um, and, uh, it's it's a a difficult project. Um, and it's worth noting that it's not like it's it's just automatic. Um I'm unaware of any robot program by uh Ford or GM or you know any by US sort of car companies. People like I think maybe think of Tesla as as a car company. We mostly make cars um and battery packs. Uh but uh so it's not like it's not just like an obvious fall off a log thing to make Optimus.</p>

Elon Musk：我们期待在第一季度展示Optimus V3，我认为它会非常出色。它甚至看起来不像一个机器人，会像一个穿着机器人服装的人，这有点像我们最初开始Optimus的方式。但它会看起来如此真实，以至于你需要戳一下它，才能相信它真的是一个机器人。

Um, so, uh, first of all, uh, I have nothing but great things to say about Samsung. They're an amazing company. Um, and Samsung, it is worth noting, um, does manufacture, um, our AI4 computer and does a great job doing that.</p>

Elon Musk：现在关于AI5，我需要澄清一下我之前公开发表的一些评论，那就是我们实际上会让台积电和三星最初都专注于AI5。特斯拉设计的AI5芯片，我认为是一个了不起的设计。

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: Um so um now w with the the AI5 um and here's I I need to make a point of clarification relative to some comments I've made publicly uh before which is we're actually going to focus both TSMC and Samsung initially on AI5. So, um, the the AIF chip design by Tesla is I I think it's an amazing design.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：我几乎每个周末都和芯片设计团队一起研究AI5。我不轻易表扬人，但我必须说，我认为特斯拉的芯片团队正在设计一款令人难以置信的芯片。从某些指标来看，AI5芯片将比AI4芯片好40倍，不是40%，是40倍。

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: Um, I have spent almost every weekend for last last few months uh with the chip design team working on AI5. And I I don't hand out praise easily, but I have to say that I think I think the Tesla chip team is is really designing an incredible chip here. This is by some metrics the AI5 chip will be 40 times better than the AI4 chip. Not 40%, 40 times.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：我们对整个软硬件堆栈有详细的了解，所以我们正在设计硬件来解决软件中的所有痛点。我认为没有人能做到这一点，即贯穿整个堆栈，一直到真实世界，并根据真实世界进行校准，你有在真实世界中的汽车和机器人。我们知道芯片需要做什么，同样重要的是，我们也知道芯片不需要做什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: um because we we have a detailed understanding of the entire software and hardware stack. So we're designing the hardware to uh address all of the pain points in software. Um, so I don't think there there really isn't anyone that's doing this the the entire stack um all the way through real world uh you know calibrating against the real world where you've got cars and robots in real world that like we we know what the chip needs to do and we know what and just as importantly we know what the chip does doesn't need to do.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：我对我在这件事上投入了如此多的生命能量。我相信这将是下一个级别的赢家。所以，让三星和台积电都专注于AI5是有道理的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: this this is a beautiful chip. Um, I've poured so much life energy into this show personally. Um, and I'm I'm confident this will be this is going to be a winner next level. Um, so it makes sense to have uh both Samsung and TSMC focus on AI5.</p>
</details>

Elon Musk：我根本的担忧是，关于我在特斯拉拥有多少投票控制权，如果我继续建造这支庞大的机器人军队，我将来会不会在某个时候被赶下台？这是我最大的担忧。这就是我试图通过这个所谓的薪酬方案来解决的唯一问题，但这并不是说我会去花掉这笔钱，只是，如果我们建立了这支机器人军队，我至少对它有强大的影响力，不是控制，而是强大的影响力，归根结底就是这样。如果我没有至少强大的影响力，我不会安心去建造那支机器人军队。

<p class="english-text">Elon Musk: you know, my like like my, you know, fundamental concern with regard to how much voting control I have in Tesla is if I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future? Um, that's my biggest concern. if I that's that that is the the that is really the only thing I'm trying to address with with this uh so what's called compensation but it's not like I'm going to go expend the money it's just you know if we build this robot army um do I have at least uh a strong influence over that robot on the not not control but a strong influence that's that's what it comes down to in a nutshell um like I don't feel comfortable building that robot on me if I don't have at least a strong influence</p>

### 会后分析：增长前景与估值挑战

Steve：是的，我有点惊讶它没有跌得更多，说实话。

Amit：你觉得这个季度有那么糟糕吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Did you think it was that bad of a quarter?</p>
</details>

Steve：是的。看，我没有通读报告，只是扫了一眼数字，但是，是的，这对特斯拉来说不是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: Yes. Now look, I didn't read through the note. I just glanced at the numbers, but yes, this is not good for Tesla.</p>
</details>

Amit：好的，那给我你最直接的想法。EPS未达预期，营收符合预期。你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, so give me your raw thoughts. EPS miss revenue in line. What do you think?</p>
</details>

Steve：是的，这完全是我的初步想法，我稍后可能会改变主意，但我不认为我会改变，因为考虑到监管积分将在第四季度消失，这很可能是汽车利润率在相当长一段时间内的最佳水平。所以他们可能已经提前了很多东西。这还有待观察。我不认为他们会像过去那样有一个强劲的假日季节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: Yeah, I mean look, this is completely raw thoughts and I may change my mind later, but I don't think I'm going to because this is the best the auto margins are likely to be for quite some time considering that you have the regulatory credits becoming extinct in Q4. So, they could have pulled a lot of stuff forward. We that remains to be seen. I don't think they're going to have as strong as a holiday season as they would have in the past.</p>
</details>

Steve：能源业务非常有趣。我实际上认为能源业务的营收数据非常好，因为随着XAI和其他公司建立更多的数据中心，他们可能会获得更多的电池组之类的东西。我不认为他们在住宅太阳能和Powerwall方面会有大的增长，因为花三万、四万、五万美元来安装这些系统对人们来说不会那么有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: Um, the energy is very interesting. I actually think the energy numbers were really good on the top line because as X AI and other companies build out more data centers, they're likely to get more battery packs, that type of thing. I don't think they're going to get a big bump in residential solar and power walls just because it's not going to be as advantageous for people to spend 30, 40, 50 grand to put those systems in.</p>
</details>

Steve：我现在关注的重点是他们的毛利率和营业利润率正在下降。我看不出在积分消失的情况下，他们如何能让这些指标回升。他们需要做些别的事情。机器人来得不够快。这次财报电话会议非常重要。如果他们搞砸了这次电话会议，股价会跌破400美元。如果他们有一个很棒的财报电话会议，股价可能会涨到475美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: Um, the big thing that I'm looking at right now is their gross margin and operating margin going down. And I don't see how they can get that back up with credits going away. they're going to need to do something else. Robots can't come fast enough. This earnings call is so important. If they botch this earnings call, this is going under 400. If they have a good if they have a great earnings call, this could go to 475.</p>
</details>

Steve：这是一个成败攸关的时刻，关系到他们何时能真正开始从不仅仅是Optimus，还包括在机器人出租车方面做些什么，并真正解释他们到底打算怎么做，因为从表面上看，这不是……这就是为什么股价现在没有呈抛物线式上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: This is a make-or-break moment for when they're actually going to start generating real revenue from not just optimist but actually doing something with robo taxes and actually explaining what the hell they're going to do with it because this is on the surface not there's a reason why this is not going parabolic right now.</p>
</details>

Steve：当我把特斯拉的数据输入我的模型时，过去12个月的自由现金流是68.3亿美元。即使你推断，即使我说，好吧，他们这个季度做了40亿，我们就假设他们在接下来的四个季度里也能做到，然后他们未来会做160亿，他们仍然是一家1.4万亿美元的公司。对于这么大的市值来说，自由现金流并不多。所以我只是不知道。我不激动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: and when I do the number like I'm putting Tesla into my model right Now, I mean, $6.83 billion in free cash flow over the TTM. Even if you extrapolate out, even if I was to say, okay, they did four billion this quarter. Let's just say they match that in the next four and they're going to do 16 billion going forward, they're still a $1.4 trillion company. That's not a lot of free cash flow for a market cap of that size. So, I just I don't know. I'm not thrilled.</p>
</details>

Amit：你看到了什么积极的方面吗？还是说这些数字太离谱了，你不知道该如何理解？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Is there anything positive you saw or are the numbers just so egregious that you don't know how to make sense of it?</p>
</details>

Steve：我需要通读整个报告。就像我说的，我只是扫了一眼数字，但我看到的数字并不能证明这个市值是合理的，而我还是个特斯拉股东。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: I need to read through the entire report. Like I said, I just glanced through the numbers, but the numbers that I'm seeing do not justify this market cap and I'm a Tesla shareholder.</p>
</details>

Steve：我喜欢自由现金流增长了46%。我不喜欢调整后的EBITDA下降了9%。在一个你无法再获得监管积分的季度里。我们知道这不会再发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: look, I love that the free cash flow is up 46%. I don't like that the adjusted IBID is down 9%. Yeah. In a quarter where you're not getting regulatory credits back. Like we know that's not happening.</p>
</details>

Steve：我也不喜欢利润率在下降。我们认为利润率会好转吗？在接下来的几个季度里，当你的营业利润率只有5.8%时，你认为他们能回到11%或12%吗？我不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: And I don't like the margins are going down. Like do we think margins are going to get better where they're going to get back to an 11 or 12% operating margin in the next couple of quarters when you're at 5.8? I don't think so.</p>
</details>

Amit：好的。那么，你认为埃隆会在电话会议上说些什么来让股价产生积极反应吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay. So, do do you think Elon says anything on the call that gets the stock to react in a positive way?</p>
</details>

Steve：当然。他必须说：“听着，大惊喜。Optimus将在2026年上市，我们预计将销售25万台，然后在2027年销售100万台，而且来自公司的积压订单如此之多，以至于到2030年公众都无法买到。”我认为如果他这么说，股价会超过500美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: Absolutely. He's got to say, "Listen, big surprise. Optimus is coming in 2026 and we expect to sell 250,000 units and then 2027 we sell a million units and there's such a huge backlog from companies this won't even be available to the public till 2030." I think if he says that this goes over 500.</p>
</details>

Amit：但有趣的是，他可以这么说，谁在乎呢？如果没实现，那也是埃隆的风格，对吧？就像没人会……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: dude. But the funny thing is he can say it and like who cares? Like if it doesn't happen, it's Elon, right? It's like no one's gonna whatever.</p>
</details>

Steve：所以他理论上可以这么说。
