### 议员为何留在华盛顿？

What compels you to be in town right now? And should all members of the House be here?

是什么迫使你们现在留在城里？众议院的所有议员都应该在这里吗？

### 众议院Speaker关闭议会，拒绝召集议员

Yeah, well, let me just point out that it's not just that the House is not in session. The Speaker of the House has shut down the House and is refusing to call his own members back to Washington, D.C. And in fact, Democrats have shown up. Now, week two, we are here. We are fighting to get a bipartisan deal to reopen the government, to address American health care costs and to make sure that our democracy works for all Americans. And if Mike Johnson is not going to call us back, we are still going to continue to show up for the American people because that is what we do.

是的，嗯，让我指出一点，不仅仅是众议院没有开会。众议院议长已经关闭了众议院，并且拒绝召集他自己的议员们返回华盛顿特区。事实上，民主党人已经出现了。现在是第二周，我们在这里。我们正在努力争取一项两党协议，以重新开放政府，解决美国医疗保健的成本问题，并确保我们的民主制度为所有美国人服务。如果迈克·约翰逊不召集我们回去，我们仍然会继续为美国人民出现，因为这就是我们所做的。

### 应对医疗保健成本上升的斗争

Now, I do take a little bit of difference with what I just heard from my colleague across the aisle here in the Senate. We are fighting to make sure that Americans health care doesn't get jacked up in the coming weeks. We're talking about your health care premiums going from, let's say, 300 or $400 a month, up to 800 $1,000 a month. This is not just some hypothetical about health care policy. This is about real costs. The real Americans are going to feel in the next few weeks if we don't act now.

现在，我与我在参议院的对面议员刚才所说的略有不同。我们正在努力确保美国人在未来几周内医疗保健费用不会被大幅提高。我们说的是你的医疗保险费可能从每月 300 或 400 美元，上涨到每月 800 或 1000 美元。这不仅仅是关于医疗保健政策的某种假设。这是关于切实的成本。如果我们现在不采取行动，美国人民在未来几周内将感受到真实的成本。

### 回应关于“俄巴马医改补贴”的说法

Well, you know what Republicans say about this. And we just heard from Jason Smith before you joined us that this is unrelated to the funding issue, that Democrats don't object to anything in the bill. So you should pass it and get the Congress reopened to actually have a negotiation over Obamacare subsidies. How would you respond to him?

嗯，你知道共和党人对此怎么说。在你加入我们之前，我们刚刚听到了杰森·史密斯的发言，他说这与资金问题无关，民主党人对法案中的任何内容都没有异议。所以你们应该通过它，让国会重新开放，以便真正就《平价医疗法案》的补贴进行谈判。你将如何回应他？

### 共和党的“财政预算案”与削减开支

Well, that's absolutely ridiculous, because Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, and they spent the first nine months of this year working on a domestic policy package that cut health care, the cut food assistance, the cut educational assistance. And they gave billionaires multibillion dollar tax breaks permanently and slashed benefits for millions of Americans. And so for them to claim that you shouldn't use a budgetary process to enact policy is the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard in my life, because they just spent nine months doing that and taking American health care away, and now they're refusing to fix what they broke so that their arguments hold no water. And the fact that the house is closed and the speaker is refusing to bring people back to even negotiate, even if they did want to cut a deal, they couldn't because the House isn't even here.

嗯，这绝对是荒谬的，因为共和党人控制着众议院、参议院和白宫，他们花了今年头九个月的时间制定了一项国内政策方案，削减了医疗保健、食品援助和教育援助。他们永久性地给予了亿万富翁数千亿美元的税收减免，并削减了数百万美国人的福利。因此，他们声称你不应该利用预算程序来制定政策，这是我一生中听过的最荒谬的事情，因为他们刚刚花了九个月时间这样做，并剥夺了美国人的医疗保健，现在他们却拒绝修复他们自己造成的损害，所以他们的论点毫无说服力。而且，众议院已经关闭，议长拒绝召集议员们回来谈判，即使他们想达成协议，也无法实现，因为众议院根本就不在这里。

### OMB的角色与联邦雇员的薪资问题

Part of the reason why I wanted to talk with you, Congresswoman, is that you're a former OMB staffer and the Office of Management and Budget has the keys to the castle. The Keys, I should say, to the castle. Right now, President Trump is talking about potentially laying off mass numbers of furloughed workers. He's also suggesting that some of the furloughed workers now who are not receiving paychecks not be made whole when they come back to work. I realize the speaker takes issue with that. He believes that federal workers should be paid and receive back pay when they come back. But as somebody who's been inside the agency at OMB, talk to us about the decisions that are being made right now and how much leeway Russ Vogt has over federal spending.

我之所以想和你谈谈，国会议员女士，部分原因是你是前任管理和预算办公室（OMB）的职员，而管理和预算办公室掌握着关键。我现在应该说，掌握着关键。目前，特朗普总统正在谈论可能大规模解雇被强制休假的工人。他还建议，一些目前未收到工资而被强制休假的工人，在回来工作时不会得到全额补偿。我了解到议长对此有意见。他认为联邦雇员应该在回来时获得报酬和追溯工资。但是，作为一个曾在 OMB 机构工作过的人，请告诉我们现在正在做出的决定，以及拉塞尔·沃格特在联邦支出方面有多大的自由裁量权。

### 联邦雇员的薪资权与法律保障

Well, I think we've seen time and time again, this administration seems to have very little regard for the law, but the law is very clear here. You cannot fire federal workers during a shutdown. And we passed legislation in 2019 to guarantee back pay for federal workers. So whatever the president says, he cannot just make stuff up. The law applies and they cannot withhold pay from federal workers. So if you were a federal worker out there listening to this, if you receive a notice, if you receive notice that you're not going to receive backpay, that is just untrue. You have rights and the law is on your side.

我认为我们一次又一次地看到，本届政府似乎不太遵守法律，但这里的法律非常明确。在政府停摆期间，你不能解雇联邦雇员。我们在 2019 年通过了立法，以保证联邦雇员的追溯工资。所以，无论总统说什么，他都不能凭空捏造。法律适用，他们不能扣留联邦雇员的工资。所以，如果你是一位在那里收听此节目的联邦雇员，如果你收到通知，如果你收到你不会收到追溯工资的通知，那完全是错误的。你拥有权利，法律站在你这边。

### 国民警卫队部署的争议：新墨西哥州与总统的做法

Congresswoman Stansbury, I want to ask you about a separate matter as National Guard troops mobilized outside of Chicago. It appears that we have a third city now where National Guard troops are being deployed by the president. But there's something interesting that's been going on in your state. The Washington Post reported on this a couple of weeks ago because there are, in fact, National Guard members who have been in the city of Albuquerque now for more than 100 days. The headline on the story, this blue state governor sent the National Guard to her biggest city, no guns, no Humvees, no arrests. This deployment looks very different from the way President Trump has used soldiers in places like D.C. and Chicago. In fact, you've got guys and gals walking around in black polo shirts and khakis, not carrying firearms and have actually come to know some people in the community. Some folks have come to rely on them. What is your governor, Lujan Grisham, doing differently than the president in making this work?

斯坦斯伯里国会议员女士，我想问你一个单独的问题，关于国民警卫队在芝加哥外围的动员。现在似乎是我们有第三个城市，总统在那里部署了国民警卫队。但是，在你所在的州也发生了一些有趣的事情。《华盛顿邮报》几周前曾对此进行过报道，因为事实上，在阿尔伯克基市已经有国民警卫队成员驻扎了 100 多天。这篇报道的标题是，“这位蓝色州州长派遣国民警卫队前往她最大的城市，没有枪支，没有悍马车，没有逮捕。” 这种部署方式与特朗普总统在华盛顿特区和芝加哥等地使用士兵的方式截然不同。事实上，你看到男男女女穿着黑色的Polo衫和卡其裤在街上走动，不携带枪支，并且已经与社区中的一些人建立了联系。有些人甚至开始依赖他们。你的州长卢汉·格里沙姆在让这件事奏效方面，与总统的做法有什么不同？

### 州长与总统部署国民警卫队的不同之处

Well, there's a fundamental difference between a governor coordinating with local officials and local law enforcement to provide additional support and backup where it is wanted and discussed and deployed in a safe manner in a community, versus the president illegally deploying National Guard to states and cities where it is unwanted. Where the governors and mayors have said, no, do not send them and is trying to use legal authorities that frankly don't exist. It's also very clear that the president is doing this as a show of force. He is trying to scare the American people. He is trying to show that he has power and he's going to send individuals in with guns to scare the American people to back up his policies. But that is not the same as a coordinated legal authority under which a governor and local authorities use the deployment as a way to support local law enforcement.

嗯，州长与地方官员和地方执法部门协调，在社区中提供他们想要的支持和后援，并以安全的方式部署，这与总统非法将国民警卫队部署到州和城市，而这些地方并不需要他们，这是根本的区别。州长和市长已经明确表示“不行，不要派他们来”，而总统却试图使用那些坦白说并不存在的法律权力。也很明显，总统这样做是为了展示实力。他试图恐吓美国人民。他试图表明他拥有权力，并且他将派持枪人员去恐吓美国人民，以支持他的政策。但这与州长和地方当局通过部署来支持当地执法部门的协调一致的法律授权是不同的。

### 阿尔伯克基犯罪率下降的原因

Well, I think it's a fascinating story because this is, of course, an extremely controversial issue when you factor in the the matter of Posse Comitatus. And to see this happening in your city with crime in Albuquerque now falling across most all categories. This idea that in this year, I guess it runs against the grain of those criticizing the idea of using National Guard troops and speaks to the nuances of how we can use them. Do you agree?

嗯，我认为这是一个引人入胜的故事，因为这当然是一个极具争议的问题，当你考虑到《波塞·科密塔图斯法案》（Posse Comitatus Act）时。看到这种情况发生在你所在的城市，阿尔伯克基的犯罪率现在在大多数类别中都在下降。这个想法，我想，今年它与那些批评使用国民警卫队的人的观点相悖，并且说明了我们可以如何使用他们的细微差别。你同意吗？

### 投资社区和行为健康才是关键

No, because actually, the reason why crime is falling in Albuquerque is because we have had a sustained investment over the last seven years in behavioral health programs, in getting fentanyl off the street and in community policing. And so the ad over the last several weeks of additional support for law enforcement helps to relieve pressure on existing law enforcement. But it is not what actually drove crime rates down in Albuquerque, which drove crime rates down, was actually investing in our community and behavioral health.

不，因为实际上，阿尔伯克基犯罪率下降的原因是我们过去七年一直在持续投资于行为健康项目，将芬太尼从街头清除，以及社区警务。因此，过去几周增加的对执法部门的额外支持有助于减轻现有执法部门的压力。但这并不是真正导致阿尔伯克基犯罪率下降的原因，真正导致犯罪率下降的是我们对社区和行为健康的投资。

### 继续投资行为健康和解决毒品危机

Would you like to see these hundred or so troops continue their jobs in Albuquerque? What I would like to see is continued investment in behavioral health and getting fentanyl off the street, because that is the number one thing driving crime in most major cities in America right now. And we have an addiction crisis and we need to be investing in our communities.

你希望看到这大约一百名士兵继续在阿尔伯克基工作吗？我希望看到的是继续投资于行为健康，并将芬太尼从街头清除，因为这是目前美国大多数大城市犯罪的主要驱动因素。我们正面临一场成瘾危机，我们需要投资于我们的社区。

### 支付部队和联邦雇员的薪资，并重新开放政府

Now we're talking about National Guard troops. And there's a question about military of active duty military troops going without pay starting on the 15th. Congresswoman. Some folks are pushing for a stand alone piece of legislation to pay them out of money from the president's big, beautiful bill. We've only got about a minute left. Speaker Johnson says no, we already passed a bill to pay the troops. How about you? I personally, personally think we need to pay our troops. We're here in the Capitol. Our Capitol Police are not getting paid. We need to pay our troops, pay our federal employees, and get the government reopened. And that requires Mike Johnson reopening the House.

现在我们正在谈论国民警卫队。有一个问题是关于现役部队将在 15 日开始无薪工作。国会议员女士。有些人正在推动一项独立的立法，从总统的“伟大而美丽的法案”的资金中支付他们。我们只剩下大约一分钟时间了。约翰逊议长说不，我们已经通过了一项支付部队的法案。你呢？我个人、我个人认为我们需要支付我们的部队。我们在这里国会大厦。我们的国会警察没有得到报酬。我们需要支付我们的部队，支付我们的联邦雇员，并重新开放政府。这需要迈克·约翰逊重新开放众议院。
