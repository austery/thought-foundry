### 超越僵化的政治经济框架

I want people to get out of these rigid frameworks like socialist, capitalist, neoliberal, autocratic to think about the US and China.

我希望人们能跳出那些僵化的框架，比如社会主义、资本主义、新自由主义、专制主义，来思考美国和中国。

I want both Americans as well as Chinese to demand better from their government.

我希望美国人和中国人都能要求他们的政府做得更好。

What works really well in China and what do we have in the US right now?

中国哪些方面做得非常出色？我们现在在美国又有哪些优势？

There is no winner here. There is no loser here. It's not a race. Nobody gets to hit the win button. We should be having some sort of better synthesis.

这里没有赢家，也没有输家。这不是一场比赛，没有人能按下胜利按钮。我们应该寻求某种更好的融合。

### 《Breakneck》一书旨在引发的讨论

Dan, the book is Breakneck. It's a New York Times bestseller in just under two weeks. Congratulations. Thank you. Um, what is the conversation that you hope to to to create with the book? What do you want people to take from it?

丹，这本书是《Breakneck》（全速前进）。它在不到两周的时间内就登上了《纽约时报》畅销书榜单，恭喜你。谢谢。嗯，你希望这本书能引发什么样的对话？你希望人们从中带走什么？

I think that I want people to get out of these rigid frameworks like socialist, capitalist, neoliberal, autocratic to think about the US and China.

我认为我希望人们能跳出那些僵化的框架，比如社会主义、资本主义、新自由主义、专制主义，来思考美国和中国。

I want both Americans as well as Chinese to demand better from their government.

我希望美国人和中国人都能要求他们的政府做得更好。

We're sitting here now in Silicon Valley. Um, not far away is the California highspeed rail project meant to connect San Francisco and uh uh Los Angeles. It's been more than 15 years since voters approved this referendum to uh build this train. How many people have taken this train? Uh, precisely zero.

我们现在坐在硅谷。不远处就是加州高铁项目，旨在连接旧金山和洛杉矶。自选民批准这项公投修建这条铁路以来，已经过去了十多年。有多少人乘坐过这趟火车？准确地说，是零。

uh Silicon Valley it works really well in all sorts of ways and doesn't work well for most people and so I want people to in America to demand better from local governments and I want China and I want Chinese to feel like they can have live in a government that respects individual rights and respects their own individual creative flourishing.

硅谷在很多方面运行得非常好，但对大多数人来说，它运行得并不好。所以，我希望美国人能要求地方政府做得更好，我也希望中国人能够生活在一个尊重个人权利、尊重他们自身创造力蓬勃发展的政府之下。

### “律师社会”与“工程国家”的文化分野

Yeah. And one of the framings you add to this book that I think is the meme that's become more most popular from it is is uh the competition between you know America being a society of lawyers the political class and and China more engineering and and the different cultures there. Um Stephen I know you found that that sort of breakdown remarkable. Why don't you talk about that?

是的。你在这本书中加入的一个框架，我认为是其中最流行的一个梗，就是关于竞争的：你知道美国是一个律师主导的社会，一个政治阶层，而中国更偏向于工程领域，以及其中不同的文化。史蒂芬，我知道你觉得这种划分很引人注目。你来谈谈吧。

Well, I in a lot of ways I I bring it back to the way that um that we frame companies often and we see companies in Silicon Valley as like startups and we see startups as being founderled and we quite often I wouldn't say exclusively but near exclusively see them as as the product or engineering people particularly in this AI era we see them as the engineering people and we we then see the big companies as somewhere along the way making this transition to being MBA which in a lot of ways is kind of lawyerled.

我从很多方面将它追溯到我们对公司的定名方式。我们将硅谷的公司视为初创企业，将初创企业视为由创始人领导的。我们非常频繁地——我不会说完全——但几乎总是将他们视为产品或工程人员，尤其是在这个人工智能时代。然后我们看到大公司在某个时候完成了向“MBA”的转型，这在很多方面可以被视为律师主导的。

It's it's they're led by the rules of a system and arbitrage of those rules rather than breaking the rules with new bits of technology. And so I see that and and I you know we we see it in how the companies even have reacted to AI where all the big companies immediately went to the government and basically said regulate us which to me is the lawyer culture right like what it was it literally blew my mind that companies would start off before this technology is diffused before anybody knows about it thinking regulate us and and yet there we were. So I do see that similarity. I wonder how many A6Z companies have been led by lawyers.

这表明他们是受到系统规则和对这些规则进行套利来领导，而不是通过新技术来打破规则。我看到了这一点，我们看到公司对人工智能的反应也体现了这一点：所有大公司立即去找政府，基本上说“请监管我们”，这在我看来就是律师文化。老实说，在技术传播开来、没有人知道它之前，公司就主动要求监管，这真的让我感到震惊，但事实就是如此。所以我确实看到了这种相似性。我想知道有多少 a16z 的公司是由律师领导的。

Number's probably not zero, right? Uh well, I'm actually on the board of a company of software for lawyers that was co-founded by a lawyer by coincidence, but not very many. There are people with law degrees, but they often have engineering undergraduate degrees. Okay. Or or they were lawyers and then immediately just made the leap to being operating executives in startups.

数字可能不是零，对吧？嗯，我实际上是“律师软件”公司的一名董事会成员，这家公司恰好由一位律师共同创立，但这属于巧合，但数量不多。确实有些人拥有法学学位，但他们通常拥有工程学本科学位。或者他们曾是律师，然后立即跳槽成为初创公司的运营高管。

### 汲取双方之长：对政府能力的期望

Yeah. You you mentioned in your opening that you want America and China to both demand better their governments. Why won't you flesh that that out a bit more? Some people point to this convergence or or say that hey we we are borrowing from each other. Not necessarily always the the best things but why don't you talk about that too?

是的。你在开场白中提到，你希望美国和中国都能要求政府做得更好。你能再详细阐述一下吗？有些人指出这种趋同性，或者说我们正在相互借鉴。不一定总是最好的东西，但你能不能也谈谈这个？

Yeah. So what works really well in China? I think it is the uh urban living experience and the countryside living experience day-to-day life uh functions really really well.

是的。那么，中国哪些方面做得非常出色呢？我认为是城市生活体验和乡村生活体验，日常生活的运作非常顺畅。

So, I was living in Shanghai, China's most functional city, where everything pretty much works. You go outside, subway stations are not very far. There's dense commercial areas. The shops stay open past 8:00 p.m., which is not something you can say necessarily about San Francisco. Um, and the uh train and the uh park systems all work beautifully.

我住在上海，那是中国功能最完善的城市，几乎所有事情都运转良好。你走到外面，地铁站离得很近。有密集的商业区。商店营业到晚上 8 点以后，这不是旧金山能轻易做到的。嗯，而且火车和公园系统都运行得非常漂亮。

In the Chinese countryside, the a lot of the remote villages are still really well connected by bridges, by highspeed rail, by highways. And in the US countryside, there's basically roads and cars and almost nothing else.

在中国乡村，许多偏远的村庄仍然通过桥梁、高铁和高速公路连接良好。而在美国乡村，基本上只有道路和汽车，几乎没有其他东西。

Okay, so that's what works really well in China. We have uh really functional logistical systems. We have really functional uh urban cities um that are have good order. And what do we have in the US right now?

好的，这就是中国做得非常好的地方。我们有功能强大的物流系统，有秩序良好的、功能强大的城市。那么我们现在在美国有什么呢？

Well, again in Silicon Valley, this um infrastructure here is not really wonderful. Um and what we what Silicon Valley does have, what we have here is, you know, companies worth trillions of dollars, which is not something that any other country is able to claim. Um here, uh we have uh really functional wealth creation. We have um people who are able to drive a lot of corporate value.

嗯，同样在硅谷，这里的的基础设施并不算太好。但硅谷拥有的，我们这里拥有的是价值数万亿美元的公司，这是其他国家无法声称的。在这里，我们拥有功能强大的财富创造能力，我们有能够驱动巨大企业价值的人才。

And what I'm really hoping for is that there could be a little bit of learning um between each other such that why shouldn't Cal Train work a lot better than it does? Um why shouldn't it be much more possible for workers to take the train uh to go from Silicon Valley to New York, I'm sorry, from Silicon Valley to San Francisco? Um and uh I hope that the Chinese government could actually respect its entrepreneurs, respect entrepreneurial drive, not try to crush uh anyone who is out of line with government directives. And that's that's where we should be having some sort of better synthesis.

我真正希望的是，双方之间能有一些学习，比如为什么加州火车不能运行得更好？为什么工人不能更方便地乘坐火车从硅谷到旧金山（抱歉，我说到纽约了）？我希望中国政府能够真正尊重其企业家，尊重创业精神，而不是试图压制那些不符合政府指令的人。这就是我们需要寻求更好融合的地方。

### 中国的社会工程与个人权利的冲突

Yeah. To I don't want to say it in such a cliche way to push back on it, but there is also one of the the things that you experience when when living in China too is you you know you you see the the workforce like particularly in the factories in Shenzhen. There are the rural people and they're not allowed to just move like they they can temporarily relocate for work and then the state sort of requires them to to go back and in a sense they they are forced to repatriate what they earned as a salary in the rural community.

是的。我不想用如此陈词滥调的方式来反驳，但你在中国生活时也会有这样的体验：你知道你会看到工人群体，尤其是在深圳的工厂里。有那些农村人，他们不能随意迁移，他们可以暂时为工作搬迁，但国家会要求他们返回，在某种意义上，他们被迫将他们在农村社区赚取的工资汇回去。

And so I I do think that some of the things that are but that also is a huge benefit like it's an immense benefit. It's what enabled their whole system to work. But here the cities are more attractive. If they were all allowed to move to the cities, they would love to move to the cities, but they're not allowed to. So, how do it's challenging to sort of navigate this take the best of both or to learn when you have to look at the even the best part has some parts that are that would be rejected here.

所以，我认为这其中有些方面……但这同时也是一个巨大的好处，一个巨大的好处。正是这使得他们的整个体系得以运作。但在美国，城市更有吸引力。如果他们都被允许搬到城市，他们会很乐意搬去，但他们不被允许。所以，如何应对这种情况、如何吸取两者的优点或从中学习，是很具挑战性的，因为即使是最好的部分也有一些在这里会被排斥的部分。

### 户口制度的限制与城市吸引力

Yeah. Well, the Chinese state has restricted a lot of rural people from going into the cities for quite a long time. is known as the hook system, the household registration system that um stops a lot of rural people from going into schools to access better education or healthcare.

是的。中国政府长期以来一直限制许多农村人口进入城市。这就是户口制度，即“家庭户籍登记系统”，它阻止了许多农村人进入城市学校以获得更好的教育或医疗服务。

I think a lot of that has um been loosened in the last couple of years, especially if you're in a place like Shenzhen, which is much more welcoming towards migrants. And I think one of these other big um differences between the US and China, is that in China, the cities generally work pretty well and people really want to go into the big cities.

我想在过去几年里，这种情况已经有所放松，特别是如果你在像深圳这样对移民更友好的城市。我认为美国和中国之间另一个主要的区别是，在中国，城市通常运行得相当好，人们真的很想去大城市。

in the US, well, people would much rather live in their suburbs and the cities aren't necessarily very pleasant. And what I would love for um, you know, American cities is to be much more pleasant and allow alomeration and for people to be able to afford San Francisco, afford New York and feel like they can take mass transit there in a safe way and go eat some dumplings past 8:00 p.m. or eat some sandwiches, whatever else.

而在美国，人们更愿意住在郊区，城市也并不总是那么宜人。我希望美国的城市能更宜人，能容纳人口聚集，让人们能负担得起旧金山、纽约的费用，并能安全地乘坐公共交通工具，晚上去吃饺子或三明治等。

### 律师主导的政府结构如何影响工业政策

You're right how we're a sort of lawyerly society on on the political level and yet we have you mentioned you know some of the the best companies in the world and the best entrepreneurs in the world you know but what is it about our sort of government that even Elon Musk couldn't you know help solve some of the the budget issues and how do we what is the potential path such that the law society won't sort of you know crumble or or sort of collapse strengthen sort of the the engineering one

你说得对，我们在政治层面是一个律师主导的社会，但正如你所提到的，我们拥有世界上最好的公司和最好的企业家，但我们的政府结构有什么问题，甚至连埃隆·马斯克都无法帮助解决预算问题？我们如何找到一条出路，才能让“律师社会”不会崩溃或瓦解，从而加强“工程”那一面？

yeah I think Elon is a pretty interesting guy I'm I'm sure um you guys have more thoughts and interactions um with Elon. I think that um maybe the tragedy with Elon has been that he has been focused so much on cutting costs uh focused on personnel rather than um regulatory red tape.

是的，我认为埃隆是个很有趣的人，我确信你们与他有更多的想法和互动。我认为，也许埃隆的悲剧在于他过于关注削减成本和人员，而不是关注监管上的繁文缛节。

And I think personnel costs are not a giant aspect of um America's budget. And arguably we need a lot more personnel in order to you know process drug discoveries and make the FDA uh much more efficient process high-skilled immigrant visas uh and have a much more functional government.

我认为人员成本在美国预算中并非主要部分。而且可以说，我们需要更多的人员来处理药物研发、使 FDA 流程更高效、处理高技能移民签证，并拥有一个功能更强大的政府。

And I think it is a little bit tragic also that um Elon was um focused on reducing aspects of the government that he didn't like rather than conceptualizing um how to build great projects inside the government.

而且我认为，埃隆将精力集中在削减他不喜欢的部分政府职能上，而不是构思如何在政府内部建设伟大的项目，这一点也有些令人悲哀。

So if I'm thinking of something like you know some of the great achievements of America over the past century I would offer projects like the Manhattan project the Apollo missions were which were absolutely an element of the technological sublime which had so much inspiration uh for so many people and these were engineeringled projects within the government um with a military component as well and you know I think it would be much more interesting if um Elon actually went in to try to do something like hat.

所以，如果我想到过去一个世纪美国的一些伟大成就，我会想到曼哈顿计划、阿波罗任务，它们绝对是技术壮举的一部分，给很多人带来了巨大的灵感。这些都是政府内部由工程主导的项目，并且带有军事成分。我想，如果埃隆真的进去尝试做类似的事情，那会更有趣。

Um, but what do you guys think about, you know, why Elon couldn't have cut through a lot of the morass with the regulations?

但你们怎么看，为什么埃隆无法突破那么多监管泥潭呢？

### 激励机制与“工程师思维”的局限性

Well, I think just on your question, the the Manhattan project, what is the incentive? It seems like more and more is being privatized. So, why would the best engineers in in in in the country um you know, work for sort of an initiative where there isn't that same level of upside, not just upside, but also autonomy and you know, why would do they want to be sort of, you know, it seems like outside the system is is is just working better.

我想就你的问题来说，曼哈顿计划的激励机制是什么？现在看来，越来越多的工作被私有化了。那么，为什么国家里最优秀的工程师会为一个没有同等回报（不仅是回报，还有自主权）的项目工作呢？为什么他们宁愿在体制之外工作，因为外部系统似乎运行得更好？

Yeah. Well, uh, maybe we need a degree of patriotism and national security, um, consciousness because pretty sure the Manhattan Project engineers had better things to do than go out in the desert of New Mexico and, uh, work on this thing in pretty confined environments and we're making a lot of money. That's on the upside.

是的。嗯，也许我们需要一定程度的爱国主义和国家安全意识，因为可以肯定，曼哈顿计划的工程师们有更重要的事情要做，而不是去新墨西哥州的沙漠里，在非常受限的环境中从事这项工作，而且我们正在赚大钱，这算是积极的一面。

But then, how about could Anderrell have built within even just the feasibility like effectiveness of of it, you know?

但安德雷尔如何在可行性、有效性方面进行建设呢？

Yeah, I mean it's definitely the case that the prime contractors through the Department of Defense are not really inspirational places to work and absolutely I think there should be um efforts outside of it but you know outside of just you know building products I would like for many more talented engineering types to go into the government to build all of these big um engineering projects that we really need things like mass transit things like subway systems things like uh solar wind and transmission itionize to decarbonize our economy. These are all projects that could have used an Elon to support.

是的，国防部旗下的主要承包商确实不是什么鼓舞人心的工作场所，我绝对认为应该有外部的努力。但是，除了构建产品之外，我希望有更多有才华的工程师进入政府，去建设我们真正需要的那些大型工程项目，比如大众运输、地铁系统，比如用于经济脱碳的太阳能、风能和输电项目。这些项目本可以得到埃隆这样的支持。

Well, of course, Elon led the leads the country in in solar and in energy in general. And I I think that that's pretty interesting. It is it is you know first of course in Silicon Valley when people want to point to government success I think that the general the first place they land is on the internet itself.

当然，埃隆在太阳能和能源领域处于全国领先地位。我认为这很有趣。在硅谷，当人们想指出政府的成功时，他们首先想到的就是互联网本身。

Yeah. But it also shows the incredible strength that is unique which is a a true public private partnership to develop that that involved the universities private companies and the government itself and a unique way of government funding which was like hey go build this and we don't really have a goal and I I think that's a thing that you don't often see in China the engineering focus which is we love to build with this very specific goal.

是的。但这同时也展示了一种独特的、令人难以置信的力量，即真正的公私合作，它涉及大学、私营公司和政府本身，以及一种独特的政府资助方式，就像“嘿，去建造这个，我们没有具体的目标”，我认为在中国不常看到这种以工程为中心的做法，我们喜欢带着非常具体的目标去建造。

And and I think that you always love to get those strengths of both, but there were these things where sometimes it just seems like you really can't just take the best of both. Like our we have a very long history of of saddling new initiatives here with too many extraneous things. I mean, and the chips act most recently is one where if you actually read the text of the chips act, the money came with like an unsolvable set of requirements. like there there was no way you could actually spend the money. This much had to go to these geographies. It had to employ these kinds of people. It had to do these kinds of things, spend the money in these cities and and that's not really a partnership. It's like companies really needed money and they just had to say yes and they really wanted to make a statement by having the money out there.

我们总是希望结合双方的优势，但有时似乎你真的不能只取其一。比如，我们有一个悠久的历史，就是给新的举措附加太多不必要的东西。最近的《芯片法案》就是一个例子，如果你仔细阅读法案文本，资金附带了一系列无法解决的要求：比如多少钱必须流向哪些地区、必须雇佣哪些类型的人、必须在哪些城市花钱，这算不上真正的合作。这就像公司急需资金，他们只能说“是”，并且他们想通过获得资金来表明立场。

Yeah. Which is way different than, you know, when China decides we want to be really good at like security. And this is where the uh focus of engineers typically is on the result and the t focus of lawyers typically is on the process.

是的。这与中国决定要擅长安全领域的方式截然不同。工程师的重点通常在于结果，而律师的重点通常在于流程。

And I think the at least the chips act was able to allocate a lot of the money to um the chips companies before um President Trump is now threatening to withdraw some of that. Um but if we take a look at the other big uh pieces of legislation, bipartisan infrastructure act as well as um the inflation reduction act, there's been very little by way of infrastructure actually built by the infrastructure act and there's been very little built by the way of clean technology.

我认为至少《芯片法案》成功地将很多资金分配给了芯片公司，尽管特朗普总统现在正威胁要撤回其中一部分。但如果我们看看其他主要的立法，《两党基础设施法》以及《通胀削减法案》，基础设施法案带来的基础设施建设少之又少，清洁技术方面的建设也寥寥无几。

And so, you know, I think the one of these problems that I feel is that the US is trying to do industrial policy um by putting a lot of lawyers in charge. And the lawyers are still really thinking about their committees. Um they're still really thinking about their process. And for China, in the um 20th party congress that concluded about three years ago, what Ciin Ping did was that he elevated a lot of the leaders of China's military-industrial complex, the people who ran China's crude um space missions, the people who ran China's um biggest weapons companies, and he elevated them to be provincial party secretaries and to be governors.

所以，我认为我感觉到的一个问题是，美国试图通过任命大量律师来推行产业政策。而律师们仍然在考虑他们的委员会，他们仍然在考虑他们的流程。对于中国来说，在三年前结束的二十大上，习近平做的是提拔了中国军工复合体的大量领导者，那些领导中国载人航天任务的人，领导中国最大的武器公司的人，并将他们提升为省级党委书记和省长。

And it's kind of unimaginable that someone who used to run Loheed Martin um would become a governor of a major state in the US. Um but rather we have a lot of people from law schools conducting our industrial policy and I think it's just not the right strategy to bring a lot of lawyers to a technology fight.

一个曾管理洛克希德·马丁公司的人成为美国一个主要州的州长，这几乎是不可想象的。但相反，我们让很多法学院的毕业生来主导我们的产业政策，我认为让大量律师参与技术竞争并不是正确的策略。

### 工程师的局限性：社会工程的危险

Well, we in fact we had a president who was a general who warned everybody about having generals defense contractors run the country. So there's a lot of history to to that as well. But what is it? What what one of the things you write you talk a lot about though are the challenges that engineers bring to running things. And certainly as an engineer I read that carefully.

事实上，我们有一位总统曾是将军，他警告所有人不要让将军和国防承包商来管理国家。所以这方面也有很多历史渊源。但你写了很多关于工程师在管理事务中带来的挑战。作为一个工程师，我仔细阅读了这一点。

But I I actually think my view of it is much of the excitement in at least half the audience of your book is that it points out that engineers are not good at doing at running things. And I think people gravitated to to that aspect. What what were some of the things you saw or see or experience in China that the engineering mindset really backfires?

但我实际上认为，你的书至少让一半的读者感到兴奋，是因为它指出了工程师不擅长管理事务。我认为人们正是被这一点所吸引。你在中国看到了哪些或正在经历的，让工程思维真正适得其反的事情？

Yeah, I think the problem with China is not that they're only physical engineers. If there were only physical engineers, there's some problems with overbuilding. There's some problems with that, environmental destruction, displacing people. But overall it really helps to have physical dynamism because you can see your streets, your city, your home get better year by year.

是的，我认为中国的问题不在于他们只有实体工程师。如果只有实体工程师，就会存在过度建设、环境破坏、人口迁移等问题。但总体而言，拥有实体活力确实有帮助，因为你可以看到你的街道、城市、家园一年比一年好。

The problem with China is that they are also fundamentally social engineers. And social engineering uh can be really dangerous because they treat the population itself as just another building material to be torn down as they wish and remolded as they wish.

中国的问题在于，他们从根本上也是社会工程师。而社会工程可能非常危险，因为他们将人口本身视为可以随意拆除和重塑的另一种建筑材料。

So I spent a lot of time in my book thinking about uh the one child policy as well as zero COVID which the number is right there in the name. There's no ambiguity about what the one child policy could possibly mean. And a lot of this ends up being, you know, in the case of the one child policy, this campaign of rural terror that was really medded out um against female bodies um mostly in the countryside and zero COVID made a lot of people lose their minds and it was um pretty traumatic for especially the residents of Shanghai, China's biggest city, richest city, uh in the spring of 2022 in which people couldn't leave their apartment compounds over the course of about eight weeks in the spring.

因此，我在书中花了很多时间思考一孩政策以及“清零政策”（数字就在名字里）。一孩政策的含义是毫不含糊的。在所有这些事件中，以一孩政策为例，那是一场针对女性身体的、主要在乡村地区发起的、极其恐怖的运动。而“清零政策”让很多人精神失常，尤其对 2022 年春天上海这座中国最大、最富有的城市的居民来说，是相当痛苦的经历，他们连续八周无法离开自己的小区。

And so this is where I think, you know, I'm pretty clear-eyed about having a state run by engineers, which they feel like they are just making decisions very technocratically. Everything feels super rational for them. They have the uh state capacity really to enforce a lot of their um big goals. This is where, you know, I I prefer not to have anything like one profession running everything. I think a healthier society would have not only lawyers um completely overrunning the US Congress right now. I think there's something like 47 US senators who went to law school and one has had any uh degree that resembles a STEM degree.

因此，我认为我对一个由工程师管理的国家持清醒的认识，他们感觉自己只是在以非常技术官僚的方式做决定。对他们来说，一切都显得极其理性。他们拥有强大的国家能力来执行他们的宏大目标。正因如此，我更倾向于不让任何单一的职业来管理一切。我认为一个更健康的社会不应该只有律师完全掌控美国国会，现在大约有 47 位美国参议员上过法学院，而只有一位拥有任何类似 STEM 学位的背景。

Instead of just being purely dominated by engineers or lawyers, let's have a few economists. Let's have a few entrepreneurs. Let's even throw in a few dentists in there. That's that's not so bad.

与其完全被工程师或律师主导，不如让一些经济学家、一些企业家参与进来，甚至可以加入一些牙医。这没什么不好。

We have a couple doctors. We we actually do. Excellent. Well, but it is interesting because that is a thing that that you know earlier just mentioning how we have these technology founder-led people, but very often and I actually think there's a prepoundonderance of this there's a a ying and yang actually of of a technical founder and the non-technical or the the socially oriented or businessoriented co-founder. And I I think I would agree that our our policy directives sort of lack that a balance of any kind.

我们有几个医生，确实有。太好了。但有趣的是，就像你刚才提到的，我们有这些技术创始人领导的人，但通常——而且我认为这种平衡更多——有一种技术创始人与非技术或社会导向/商业导向的联合创始人之间的阴阳平衡。我同意我们的政策方针确实缺乏任何形式的平衡。

And it's and it's very interesting and how much we're structured around the procedures of the law. Like so much of unable to build the the highspeed rail has just been the law.

以及我们围绕法律程序构建的程度非常有趣。比如，我们无法建成高铁，很大程度上就是因为法律。

Like and and it's the law used to prevent building as you know and and the chips act. It was the law that sort of said, "Well, here's all this money except use it this particular way," which is not how engineers would have thought of of the problem.

就像，你知道，法律过去是用来阻止建设的，而《芯片法案》也是法律，它说：“好吧，这里有所有这些钱，但你必须以这种特定方式使用它，”这与工程师解决问题的方式完全不同。

### 法律保护与“人人皆可诉讼”的弊端

It's a definitely a double-edged sword. You can't build companies worth trillions of dollars without having legal protections and intellectual property protections. On the other hand, um any uh fool is able to hire a lawyer to stop a project that he or she doesn't like.

这无疑是一把双刃剑。没有法律保护和知识产权保护，你就无法建立价值数万亿美元的公司。另一方面，任何傻瓜都可以聘请律师来阻止他或她不喜欢的项目。

And so I spent a lot of time looking at quite a lot of these projects that California really tries to build. Um I spent a lot of time thinking about this in particular this uh expansion plan by UC Berkeley to try to you know let more people attend and get educated on its um inside its excellent classrooms. And it was trying to build a student dormitory on this vacant lot.

所以我花了大量时间研究加州试图建设的许多项目。我花了大量时间思考加州大学伯克利分校的扩张计划，他们想让更多人入学并在其优秀的教室里接受教育。他们正试图在一块空地上建造一栋学生宿舍楼。

And homeowners nearby put up their hands and said yeah well maybe we shouldn't um let students move here. Has the states sufficiently studied the idea that students constitute some sort of noise pollution? This park, it was a tiny little park. It was a tiny little park and I think they had some affordable housing units in there as well, but they were alleging that the state didn't study sufficiently the problem that um students are pollution.

附近的房主们举手说：“也许我们不应该让学生搬到这里来。”州政府是否充分研究了学生构成某种噪音污染的观点？这个公园，它是一个非常小的公园，里面也有一些经济适用房单元，但他们声称州政府没有充分研究“学生是污染源”这个问题。

And we have all these very strange things in which, you know, often when I'm in New York, often when I'm in uh San Francisco, I live around Vaness Avenue. Vaness Avenue has tried to add a bus line uh onto the avenue for something like 20 years. It took about 20 years more or less to add a bus lane.

我们看到了很多奇怪的事情，比如当我身在纽约，或者旧金山时，我住在瓦内斯大道（Vaness Avenue）附近。瓦内斯大道尝试增加一条公交线路已经有大约 20 年了，增加一条公交车道花了差不多 20 年时间。

Um that's these are the sort of things that are kind of really crazy and often it is people hiring environmental lawyers to stop what are you know should be pretty innocuous projects.

这些事情真的很疯狂，通常是人们聘请环境律师来阻止那些本应是无害的项目。

### 对“带中国特色的社会主义”的解读

You you mentioned early in this conversation how you're trying to move past sort of simplistic uh explanations like or sort of terms like you know socialist or capitalist to describe the differences in the country. How should we interpret sort of socialism with Chinese characteristics especially as we think about the term in the US like say more about what it means to them?

你在这次谈话的开头提到，你正试图超越像“社会主义”或“资本主义”这样简单化的术语来描述两国之间的差异。我们应该如何解读“带中国特色的社会主义”，尤其是在美国思考这个术语时？请多谈谈它对他们意味着什么？

uh socialism with Chinese characteristics represents to me um a couple of things but you know first and foremost I'll say um that you know socialism with Chinese characteristics represents a lot of discretion by the state to take control of resources and uh do with it what it will so you know I think Karl Marx did not write that much about um redistribution a lot of it ended up being about public ownership of critical goods and if we take a look at China's economy

“带中国特色的社会主义”对我来说代表着几件事，但首先我要说，它代表了国家拥有很大的自由裁量权来控制资源并随心所欲地处置它们。所以，我认为卡尔·马克思关于再分配的论述并不多，很多内容最终都集中在关键物资的公有制上。如果我们看看中国的经济……

um still there's a giant state sector in which some of the most important industries in um China are owned by the state. So all of these upstream strategic industries like telecommunications um airlines um energy essentially these are always organized by three giant stateowned companies that control pretty much the entire uh state of the of the business.

……仍然存在一个庞大的国有部门，其中一些中国最重要的产业归国家所有。因此，所有这些上游战略性行业，如电信、航空、能源，基本上都由三家大型国有企业组织，它们控制着几乎整个行业的运营状态。

And so um this is partly why if you go into the countryside in China, they're not giving much cash handouts to ordinary people. In China, I think they still have this socialist mindset that every um act of spending by any personal um household is kind of this capitalist act of consumption while any big infrastructure project is this noble strike in favor of socialism.

所以，部分原因在于，如果你去中国乡村，他们不会给普通民众多少现金补助。在中国，我认为他们仍然抱有这种社会主义心态：任何家庭的每一笔支出都算作一种资本主义的消费行为，而任何大型基础设施项目都是为了社会主义而发起的崇高行动。

So, China provides a pretty threadbare uh welfare net. Um it does not provide much by way of distribution. Um Cinping often sounds like Ronald Reagan when he denounces people for um ex relying on welfare and for being too lazy. That's exactly right.

所以，中国提供了一个相当简陋的福利网。它在分配方面提供的很少。习近平在谴责那些依赖福利、懒惰的人时，听起来很像罗纳德·里根。这完全正确。

And so, you know, this is um and so so first and foremost, socialism with Chinese characteristics means that the state it is the state's pleasure to decide how to spend most of the country's resources.

所以，首先，带中国特色的社会主义意味着国家乐于决定如何花费国家的大部分资源。

The other part of socialism um with Chinese characteristics that I um offer, this is not at all a standard definition um in the political science literature is I take a look at some of these um highly competitive industries in China. And um I take think a lot about something like the solar industry in which most of these solar uh companies are extremely competitive um offering not highly differentiated products uh and um you know competition is absolutely miserable.

我提出的“带中国特色的社会主义”的另一个方面（这在政治学文献中绝非标准定义）是，我研究了中国一些竞争非常激烈的行业，比如太阳能行业。这些太阳能公司竞争极其激烈，提供的产品差异化不大，竞争可以说是非常残酷。

So the solar company margins, profit margins are pretty minuscule. The investors make very little money here. On the other hand, China owns pretty much 90% of this industry. Everything from the polysilicon processing down to um module assembly.

因此，太阳能公司的利润率非常微薄，投资者几乎赚不到什么钱。另一方面，中国拥有这个行业近 90% 的份额，从多晶硅加工到组件组装都是如此。

And so that is a national success for the state and I think Chinese firms have um inarguably driven most of the innovation in terms of um pushing down costs uh in terms of solar as well. So, you know, socialism with Chinese characteristics also means to me um investors and uh companies kind of lose. They're pretty miserable. Consumers win and the national government wins.

所以这对国家来说是一个民族成功，而且我认为中国企业无疑推动了太阳能成本下降方面的创新。因此，“带中国特色的社会主义”对我来说也意味着投资者和公司可能“输了”，他们相当痛苦。消费者赢了，国家政府也赢了。

### 中国激烈的市场竞争与知识产权保护的缺失

But Stephen, I want to ask you a little bit about some of these competitive dynamics that you saw in China. A lot of it is pretty cutthroat competition. Can you offer some um thoughts from your days at Microsoft about what sort of competition that you saw?

史蒂芬，我想问你一些你在中国看到的竞争动态。那里的竞争相当残酷。你能否从你在微软的经历中分享一些关于你所见竞争的看法？

Well, I think that the the thing that jumps to mind relative to competition is of course one of the things you you had alluded to earlier, which is that in the US you rely on a legal framework for a lot of competition. And it works both ways. It it it protects what you have, but it also gives the government the right to to take away what you have if it becomes too big or too successful.

我想到的与竞争相关的首要因素是你之前提到的：在美国，我们在很大程度上依赖法律框架来进行竞争。它有两面性：它保护你所拥有的东西，但也赋予政府在事物变得过于庞大或过于成功时将其夺走的权利。

And I I think China is very good at the taking away part. and they they by design as part of the socialist capitalist view don't really view intellectual property as the most important thing. And so in particular for for the software industry that was hugely problematic because the software industry itself is just an intellectual property business.

我认为中国非常擅长“剥夺”这一部分。而且，作为社会主义和资本主义结合的产物，他们从设计上就不认为知识产权是最重要的。这对软件行业尤其成问题，因为软件行业本身就是一项知识产权业务。

And in your book you write about China never really hasn't exported the arts and entertainment very much yet. Correct. And that's also because there's not a lot of intellectual property protection.

在你的书中你写到，中国在艺术和娱乐方面尚未真正大量出口。没错。这也是因为知识产权保护力度不够。

Like if you invented an incredibly cool Marvel con comic universe in China, you wouldn't have any real protection to be able to maintain it. Like people could just copy it. They could own all your merch, copy all your merch, and the economics of it go away.

比如，如果你在中国创造了一个极其酷炫的漫威漫画宇宙，你将没有真正的保护来维护它。人们可以随便复制它，拥有你所有的周边商品，所有经济效益都会消失。

And I've always found that particularly interesting. And then of course at a very granular level like you you literally don't when you do business in China you you don't have trade secret and you're you're just in the office and there's the CCP members that work in your office that you're forced to employ that report back to what's going on and you have no say in that like at the level of like they get to walk into your data center and they get to log on to any system and that's that's the cost of of doing business.

我一直觉得这一点特别有趣。然后在非常细微的层面上，当你在中国做生意时，你没有商业秘密保护。你就在办公室里，而你被迫雇佣的、向你报告情况的中共党员就在你的办公室里，你对此无能为力。他们可以走进你的数据中心，登录任何系统，这就是做生意的代价。

It's sort of like in the US, you open up a restaurant, the the food inspector can show up at any point and walk around the kitchen all they want, except when it's a data center and the goal is not safety for the consumers but security for the state. It it's a sort of a different a different kind of challenge.

这有点像在美国，你开一家餐馆，食品检查员可以随时出现，在厨房里随便走动，但如果是数据中心，目标就不是消费者安全，而是国家安全。这是一种不同类型的挑战。

### 饥饿的中国供应商与美国贸易展的冷漠

When you were hiring a lot of engineers in China, um what were you looking for? How hungry were they? Were they dynamic? How

你在中国招聘大量工程师时，你在寻找什么？他们有多饥渴？他们有活力吗？

Yeah, that that's a great a great thing to really see and you you you do see some of this in the US, but in in China, like in particular, like the example I always use is is um I start from the Consumer Electronic Show and you you go to one part of the show where all the component makers are and you want magnets like to to put your MagSafe adapter on and there's 500 companies selling magnets and you walk up to any one of them and you just take the slightest bit of interest and they're whipping out a dealbook and they are hungry to not just like I talked to a guy last CES and CS on my mind because it's it's registered this week but um he made uh cases for iPhones with with chargers and magnets and stuff in them and he was like what do you not like?

是的，这真是个值得关注的好点。你在美国也能看到一些这种情况，但在中国，尤其如此。我总是用消费电子展（CES）的例子来举例说明。你去展会的某个区域，那里都是元器件制造商，你想要磁铁来制作你的 MagSafe 适配器，那里有 500 家公司在卖磁铁。你走向其中任何一家，只要表现出丝毫兴趣，他们就会拿出合同本。他们非常渴望——不仅仅是……我上周在 CES 上和一个人谈过（CES 这周刚结束），他做了带充电器和磁铁的 iPhone 保护壳。他说：“你有什么不喜欢的？”

Have you looked at all the competitors? Have you seen the one from this other company? They suck, right? We How many do you need? And you're like asking like like I'm just a guy. Like I don't even my badge doesn't say like buys lots of cases. Like it says nothing that would indicate I'm about to write a check for 300,000 units of a iPhone case.

你研究过所有竞争对手吗？你见过那家公司的产品吗？它们很烂，对吧？你需要多少？你问我的问题就像，我只是个普通人，我的徽章上都没写着“大量采购手机壳”。没有任何迹象表明我正要为 30 万个 iPhone 壳开支票。

But booth after booth, no matter the size of the component or what you want and and and it's very different than in the US. You go to a US company at a trade show and you sort of show interest. They know if you're a qualified buyer or not just by how you look and carriers and they're not going to talk to you. Like I watched a a guy just fall in love with this um this uh iPhone container that looked like Darth Vader or something last year and he just wouldn't shut up. He thought it was the coolest thing ever and they were literally about to give him an order of one, right? Just to do business with the guy and see where it led. And that hunger is is definitely a novel thing.

但是一间间的展位，无论元器件的大小或你想要什么，这和美国非常不同。你在美国公司的展位上表示出兴趣，他们会根据你的外表判断你是否是合格买家，而且他们不会跟你多说。比如去年，我看到一个家伙对一个看起来像达斯·维德的 iPhone 容器爱不释手，他不停地夸赞它有多酷，他们几乎就要给他下一个一单的订单了，只是为了和他做生意，看看后续如何。这种饥饿感绝对是一种新奇的东西。

And I we saw it when we were building Surface and we could just watch the component people, you know, basically fight over the business and they fight as, you know, the PC industry grew up in Shenzen and they have these factories where like you show up and if you commit to building, you know, 100,000 laptops, they will build you a building and they will keep all your IP in the building. They will not cross employees over and they will promise you the very best. And that's, you know, like Quanta, a company in Taiwan that does that.

我们开发 Surface 时也看到了这一点。我们可以看到元器件供应商为了做生意而“争斗”，就像深圳的 PC 行业成长起来的那样。他们有这样的工厂，如果你承诺制造 10 万台笔记本电脑，他们会为你盖一栋楼，并将你所有的知识产权都保存在大楼里，他们不会交叉使用员工，他们会向你承诺最好的服务。这就像台湾的广达（Quanta）公司那样。

And I I think I think that hunger is is definitely a thing you just don't see here to that degree.

我认为这种饥饿感是真实存在的，但在我们这里确实看不到这种程度。

### 放弃制造业的代价与“精益制造”的反思

Why not? What's the deal? Why aren't people more hungry? Why won't they build our factories?

为什么不呢？怎么回事？为什么人们不够饥渴？为什么他们不愿为我们建造工厂？

Well, the building the factories is is probably a different, you know, I'm not here to represent all of America and and what goes into it. But I I do think that the the factory thing I I view is a very subtle and interesting point. It's also one where the parties have completely switched roles over over the past 30 years or so.

嗯，建造工厂可能涉及不同的原因，我不能代表整个美国及其背后的因素。但我确实认为“工厂”这一点是非常微妙且有趣的。这也是一个在过去 30 年左右，各方角色完全互换的现象。

You know when China entered the World Trade Organization this was a milestone I I would say for earth you know it was a huge immense deal for China and but the the earth was like I I don't remember what the phrase was in the book I I think you you called it like it was consistent with the elite agenda or or something like this and and it was like the oh consensus it was the elite consensus that China entering the world trade organization was the right thing and not one person in Western Europe or in the US thought, "Oh, this could be a problem."

你知道，中国加入世界贸易组织是全球的一个里程碑，对中国来说是一件天大的事。但当时全球舆论（我记不清书里那个短语是什么了，大概是“符合精英议程”之类）——是精英们的共识，认为中国加入 WTO 是正确的事情，没有一个西欧或美国的人会想：“哦，这可能会成为一个问题。”

Like, it was, in fact, it was like, "This is the greatest thing ever. It's the true global Star Trek one economy where everybody just practices art all day and we all just it's great." and and it really created this what I would think of in the in a not the most positive way but like this private equity phase of American business which was all the businesses just said how do we get rid of our factories cuz like we can't employ people because they were busing people in from rural China to work for small wages every day and busing them back and we can't compete with that and they're committed to low price high volume and so you know It starts with t-shirts and socks and then it gets to radios.

事实上，大家都在想：“这是有史以来最伟大的事情。这是真正的全球‘星际迷航’经济，每个人整天都在搞艺术，太棒了。”这确实催生了——我可能用不太积极的方式来形容——美国商业的“私募股权阶段”。所有企业都想知道如何摆脱工厂，因为我们无法雇佣工人，因为他们（中国）可以每天用低工资将农村工人从中国各地运来工作，再把他们送回去，我们无法与之竞争，他们致力于低价高量。所以，你懂的，从 T 恤、袜子开始，然后发展到收音机。

You see this all over Asia. You see even Japan saying, "Well, we could make Sony TVs in China." And you could see LG saying, "Well, we could do our industrial products in China." And meanwhile, the US is like, "And we could do cars in Mexico and in Canada." And so everybody took that moment in time to say, "Well, how do we make the leanest profit-making engine in in the US?" in the first way is you just don't do you don't own manufacturing and and I I think now everybody is coming to sort of regret this.

你在整个亚洲都能看到这一点。你甚至看到日本说：“我们可以在中国生产索尼电视。”你看到 LG 说：“我们可以把我们的工业产品放在中国生产。”与此同时，美国却说：“我们可以在墨西哥和加拿大生产汽车。”所以，每个人都利用那个时刻来问：“如何在最精简的层面上为美国打造利润引擎？”第一种方式就是干脆不做，不拥有制造业。我认为现在所有人都开始后悔了。

### 制造业比例与基础设施投资的必要性

The question I have for you is I feel like on that one you the book kind of plays both sides of it. It says on the one hand the US has to manufacture stuff but on the other hand it will never compete. It can't catch up. So what is the right answer to that? Not the right. I mean, that's unfair to burden you with the right answer for that, but I'm going to burden you with the right answer for that.

我的问题是，我觉得这本书在这点上是两面讨好的。它一方面说美国必须制造东西，但另一方面又说它永远无法竞争，无法赶上。那么正确的答案是什么呢？不对，那样对你不公平，但我还是要问你正确的答案。

But let me um offer that um what matters is kind of um direction as well as intent. So um you know, right now, last I checked, China's uh share of its economy dedicated to manufacturing is about something like 26 27%. And um for the US it is about 10 11%. And so fine, you know, the US is a pretty rich country. Um, it it labor force doesn't really want to work be busted to factories and work for small wages every single day.

但让我提供一下我的看法：重要的是方向和意图。所以，据我上次查看，目前中国经济中用于制造业的份额大约是 26% 到 27%，而美国约为 10% 到 11%。美国是一个非常富裕的国家，它的劳动力似乎不太愿意每天去工厂辛苦工作，赚取微薄的工资。

But why doesn't the US try to achieve let's say Japan or German levels of um, you know, manufacturing as a share of GDP which are closer to 20%. Yeah. And so I don't think there's any natural law that says that um you know manufacturing as a share of US GDP should only be about 10%. Let's try to get it a little bit higher. Let's try to get workers um quite a lot more excited about um building all sorts of um products.

但为什么美国不争取达到日本或德国的水平，即制造业占 GDP 的比重接近 20% 呢？我认为没有自然法则规定美国制造业占 GDP 的比重只能是 10%。我们应该努力提高一点，让工人对建造各种产品感到更兴奋。

Let's try to have the government actually create functional infrastructure such that our ports work much better than they do, our trains work much better than they do, our trucking systems. That's something that China does really well. It invests in all sorts of port infrastructure. It invests in all sorts of power production. So they have the nuclear power in order to build a lot of stuff.

让我们让政府真正创造出有效的基础设施，让我们的港口、火车、卡车运输系统比现在运行得更好。这是中国做得非常好的地方。它投资于各种港口基础设施，投资于各种电力生产，所以他们有核电来支持大量建设。

And so infrastructure, the government absolutely does have a good role to play here in terms of creating all of these public goods. And then it's also up to the entrepreneurs to decide that well making products is really really exciting and we should try to you know build a little bit here. And so when you have um you know a little bit more of these if we treat technology as more of a um aesthetic project as more of a political project that's really the sort of direction that I that I want to take things.

因此，在基础设施方面，政府在创造这些公共产品方面绝对可以发挥重要作用。然后，企业家也需要下定决心，认为制造产品是非常令人兴奋的，我们也应该在这里做点努力。如果我们把技术视为更多的是一个美学项目、一个政治项目，这正是我希望事情发展的方向。

I don't think there's a level that we can possibly target. Um but right now it doesn't seem still all that interesting for many people to build.

我认为我们不可能设定一个具体的目标水平。但目前来看，对许多人来说，制造似乎仍然没有那么吸引人。

### 冗余与缓冲在危机中的作用

The other part that China does right, I think is that it hasn't been so focused on this idea that, you know, um there's this line, I think that's kind of attributed to Tim Cook, that inventory is evil. We just got to get products out the door. We shouldn't keep them all um in in stock, have lean manufacturing.

我认为中国做得对的另一个方面是，它没有那么专注于“库存是邪恶的”这个观点，我记得这是蒂姆·库克说的：我们只需要把产品推向市场，不应该把所有东西都积压在库存中，要实行精益制造。

And when China had a crisis, as it did in um 2020 with the COVID pandemic, when it had a production issue, there were a lot of pretty inefficient um stateowned enterprises as well as um you know entrepreneurial firms that had a giant workforce that had a lot of slack in the system and they were quickly able to retool to build masks and cotton swabs and American companies were unable to do that because they had lot let a lot of their skills atrophy.

当中国在 2020 年 COVID 疫情期间遇到危机、出现生产问题时，有很多效率低下的国有企业和创业公司，它们拥有庞大的员工队伍，系统中有大量的冗余（slack），它们能够迅速改造生产线来制造口罩和棉签。而美国公司却做不到，因为他们让许多技能逐渐退化了。

This workforce is hyper well adapted and optimized for one particular task and they can't really easily retool and reskill pretty quickly to confront an emergency. And so, you know, this is where I want to um encourage us firms to build in a little bit more buffer both in terms of inventory as well as labor because you never really know when there might be a crisis and that that might strike and then you don't want to be hyper optimized for one thing.

这支劳动力队伍被高度适应和优化，只针对一项特定任务，它们很难快速重新调整和再培训以应对紧急情况。所以，我想鼓励美国的 फर्म 在库存和劳动力方面都建立更多的缓冲，因为你永远不知道危机何时会来袭，届时你不想只针对一件事进行过度优化。

### 苹果的模式与去中心化的设计

Yeah, I think that's a that's a fantastic a fantastic point and it it it sort of feeds into that evolution that happened at the start of WTO. I mean, it was it what rose for that was this whole lean manufacturing which actually came out of Japan and the idea of like how do you minimize the not just the length of the assembly line but the stockpile of inputs at the beginning of the assembly line.

是的，我认为这是一个非常棒的观点，它也与世贸组织初期发生的那种演变息息相关。当时兴起的是精益制造，它实际上源于日本，其理念是最小化不仅是装配线的长度，而是装配线前端投入品的库存。

But one thing I do think that that as because you mentioned Tim Cook, I would say something that Apple does uniquely, which in this environment they they aren't getting enough credit for is is almost like how do you even count the engineers versus the manufacturing people? Because even at Apple, the number of people that really are manufacturing people, they just happen to work in Certino and fly to Asian locations a lot is very, very high. thousands and thousands of people as part of the company.

但我认为有一点，因为你提到了蒂姆·库克，我想说苹果公司独特地做了一件事，在这个环境中他们没有得到足够的认可，那就是如何计算工程师与制造人员的比例？因为即使在苹果公司，那些真正从事制造工作的人员数量也非常庞大，他们只是碰巧在库比蒂诺工作，并经常飞往亚洲地区。

And I I think that the reason that Apple products are what they are is because they don't see this this line that people saw in the 80s or the '90s with the WTO of manufacturing is, you know, rural people on a bus doing the same operation 12 hours at a shift and then smart people figuring everything out in the headquarters.

我认为苹果产品之所以是今天的样子，是因为他们没有将 80 年代或 90 年代世贸组织时期那种界限视为绝对的：制造业就是那些坐着公交车、轮班 12 小时做同样操作的农村工人，而聪明人则在总部解决所有问题。

Apple s sees much more of a continuum. And I think where American industry really didn't do so great was it very quickly snapped to small number of people in headquarters that are the brains and there there's just too much of a distance to what's made and that's what happened with the PC industry. Like all PC laptops basically became the same because not just the manufacturing but the design and the innovation and the origination all came from the factory.

苹果看到的更像是一个连续体。我认为美国工业做得不好的地方在于，它很快就倾向于总部只有少数精英大脑负责，而与实际制造的产品之间产生了过大的距离，PC 行业就是如此。所有 PC 笔记本电脑基本上都变得一样，因为不仅是制造，设计、创新和起源都来自工厂。

And so to use your the came from the engineers, not the designers or the MBAs or the lawyers, right? And the engineers making a laptop are going to make it for efficiency. And they're in fact were responding to and the same happened with American cars.

所以，用你的话来说，这些都来自工程师，而不是设计师、MBA 或律师，对吧？制造笔记本电脑的工程师会以效率为先。事实上，他们也在回应——同样的情况也发生在美式汽车上。

Like American cars, you know, like no one your brain says, you know, an SUV and a tiny little compact car should share as many parts as possible. But an engineering outsourcing brain says, well, for efficiency sake, we should use the same turn signals and all. So, I had this tiny car with this giant turn signal cuz it was the same one they used throughout the whole Chrysler line, you know, which made no sense at all, but that's that's efficiency and that's what an engineer says, right?

比如美式汽车，你脑子里会想，一辆 SUV 和一辆小型紧凑型车应该尽可能多地共用零件。但一个外包工程的思维会说，为了效率，我们应该使用相同的转向灯等等。我有一辆小车，但它有一个巨大的转向灯，因为它和整个克莱斯勒系列车用的是同一个，这完全说不通，但这才是效率，这才是工程师的思维，对吧？

### 日本模式的教训与中国的外来学习策略

I want to ask if there are lessons that we can take or analogies from further back in history. So, uh let's look at Japan and how they built a manufacturing economy. What what are things that you think are are resonant with with how China has done it or what are things that maybe maybe not so much?

我想问一下，我们能否从更早的历史中吸取教训或类比？我们来看看日本是如何建立制造业经济的。你认为哪些方面与中国的方式有共鸣，哪些方面可能不太一样？

Yeah, I think that the biggest difference between um Japan and China is that I mean first of all I think the um Japanese are much more meticulous and they have um done um you know I think on average just a much higher quality of um production starting out. You know the the Chinese kind of started out really poor and then they got a lot better and the Chinese and the Japanese tend to be much better um throughout this process.

我认为日本和中国最大的区别在于，首先，我认为日本人更加一丝不苟，而且平均而言，他们的初期生产质量要高得多。你知道，中国起步时非常贫穷，然后他们变得更好了，而且中国和日本在整个过程中往往都做得更好。

But I think the um maybe that's just a matter of opinion, maybe that's just a a qualitative measure that is a little bit difficult to quantify. But I think the crucial crucial difference um between Japan as well as China is that Japanese companies were making mostly um Japanese product for exports and it didn't have that much foreign involvement um in Japan making something like you know the Nintendo products or the Mitsubishi products. um that was almost all Japanese value ad and China took a pretty different approach in part because of WTO accession that um Stephen um is right about is was tremendously important.

但我想，也许这只是一个观点问题，一个难以量化的定性衡量标准。我认为日本和中国之间最关键的区别在于：日本公司主要为出口生产“日本制造”的产品，日本制造任天堂或三菱产品时，外国参与度并不高，那几乎完全是日本的附加值。

而中国采取了截然不同的方法，部分原因在于世贸组织准入，史蒂芬说得对，这对他们来说至关重要。所以，中国意识到自己技术水平落后于前沿太多，不可能生产出像日本已经很擅长的游戏机或内存芯片这样的产品。

So um China was really welcoming of foreign companies, companies like Microsoft, companies like Apple and companies like Tesla to build factories in China and then um have Apple engineers come over, train a lot of people, bring their managerial talents, um bring their design talents and then mostly assemble at the start um components that were coming from the US and Japan and Germany and Korea and only provide the labor involved. olved in um producing these sort of products. That was not the case with Japan.

因此，中国非常欢迎微软、苹果、特斯拉等外国公司来华建厂，然后让苹果的工程师过来，培训大量人员，带来他们的管理和设计人才，起初主要是组装来自美国、日本、德国和韩国的零部件，只提供生产过程中所需的劳动力。日本的情况就不是这样了。

um Japan was already producing um really highquality products at the start and China was um much more excited about welcoming foreign investors and you know even today there are still a lot of products um from Apple as well as Tesla that are being produced in places like Shenzhen and Shanghai uh for export and I think the Chinese approach is uh going to avoid a lot of the problems of Japan in the past um because Japan really had been locked into its own model.

日本起步时就已经生产高质量的产品了，而中国更热衷于欢迎外国投资者。即使在今天，仍有许多苹果和特斯拉的产品在深圳、上海等地生产并出口。我认为中国的方式将避免日本过去遇到的很多问题，因为日本一直被锁定在自己的模式中。

um it is um you know suffered what we call Galapagos syndrome in which it wasn't really um you know adapted well for other markets and uh Japan was u much less integrated than China is today.

它遭受了我们所说的“加拉帕戈斯综合症”，因为它没有很好地适应其他市场，而且日本的融入程度远不如今天的中国。

### 亚洲的相互关注与美国对日本的恐慌

Stephen, you have a prop that you want to show us about something with Japan. Well, I think it's super I I love this point in that you make in the book about about quality and and what you just reiterated here. And I also think one thing that that we tend to underestimate in the west so to speak is the degree to which the the South Asian countries are incredibly focused on each other. like they everybody in Beijing knows what's going on in Tokyo, knows what's going on in Seoul, is paying attention to Singapore and they really are keyed in.

史蒂芬，你有一个关于日本的道具想给我们看。我想，你书中所讲的关于质量的观点，以及你刚才重申的观点非常棒。此外，我们西方往往低估了一点：那就是东亚国家之间是多么专注于彼此。比如，北京的每个人都知道东京和首尔发生了什么，他们都在关注新加坡，他们确实非常关注。

And I when I was living in China, that was the biggest thing I saw, which was, you know, China was very proud that Sony was coming to open factories in China for foreign investment and build TVs. and and so Sony didn't quite realize it, but what had happened what was happening to them already was that Korea had already seen how Japan was successful with TVs and had already decided LG and Samsung that we're going to win in TVs.

我在中国生活时，看到的最大的一点是，中国对索尼来华投资建厂、生产电视感到非常自豪。索尼没有完全意识到，但当时正在发生的事情是，韩国已经看到了日本在电视领域的成功，LG 和三星已经下定决心要在电视领域取得胜利。

And not in a governmentmandated way, but in a capitalist market way. And so today, the share of TVs, that's LG and and Samsung is super high for export around the world. And that was very deliberate. And it turns out in the early 2000s, China was already seeing what Korea was doing. And I I would meet with the CEOs of the electronics companies like TCL and higher. And I would think, God, these TVs are awful. Like they're they would make like these 6-in thick LED TVs, and they were they didn't have the screen technology, and they're like, "We're going to win in this."

而且，这不是政府强制的，而是通过资本主义市场的方式。所以今天，LG 和三星在世界范围内的电视出口份额非常高。这是非常刻意的。事实证明，在 21 世纪初，中国已经在关注韩国的做法了。我与 TCL 等电子公司的 CEO 会面时，会觉得：“天哪，这些电视太烂了。”他们会制造像 6 英寸厚的 LED 电视，缺乏屏幕技术，但他们却说：“我们将在这一领域取得胜利。”

And they were also going to beat Intel, and they were going to beat uh HP or whatever in making computers. But it would the thing that's interesting in today's view of things is there are a lot of people who who aren't as worried about China. And part of what they think about is like well you know we went through and your book does a great job of of all the reasons if you wanted to believe that China couldn't be successful you know the demographic problem the financing problem the R&B problems these are real things that they have to overcome.

他们还打算击败英特尔，以及在制造计算机方面击败惠普。但有趣的是，在今天的观点中，有很多人不再那么担心中国。他们考虑的一部分是：你知道，正如你的书所详细介绍的，如果你想相信中国不会成功，比如人口问题、融资问题、研发问题，这些都是他们必须克服的现实问题。

And so part of it was I was thinking back to the the 80s and and in Japan and you know like this was this Time magazine cover how to cope with Japan's business innovation. You should hold that up made in Japan.

所以，一部分原因是我回想起了 80 年代的日本，还有《时代》杂志关于“如何应对日本商业创新”的封面，你应该把它拿出来，上面写着“日本制造”。

And um and it's super interesting because it it to me I feel like I'm on a on like a talk show. Can you you get that in frame? Is that working? Yeah. Okay. Amazing.

这非常有趣，因为对我来说，我感觉自己像在脱口秀上。你能把它放进画面里吗？可以吗？太棒了。

And and I think that it's just so interesting. We spent 20 years in the US freaking out about Japan. Yeah. And and it it never really won. There was a brief time when it won. And so I worry that that's exactly the kind of incumbent complacency that can happen with China, which is well, we've been here. We saw this. We're not worried.

而且我认为这非常有趣。我们在美国花了 20 年的时间对日本感到恐慌。是的。它从未真正获胜。有过短暂的胜利时刻。所以我担心，这正是中国可能出现的“既得利益者自满情绪”，即“我们经历过这个，我们见过，我们不担心。”

and and actually all the things you just cited like the goalpost syndrome and the making things only for the Japan market not being welcome to foreign direct investment were were probably the reasons why Japan is not the leader in electronics today.

事实上，你刚才提到的所有问题，比如“移动的门柱”综合征，以及只为日本市场制造产品、不欢迎外国直接投资，这些很可能就是日本今天没有成为电子行业领导者的原因。

### 强大的竞争者与历史的教训

Yeah, I think that's a really great point about American complacency because America can cite this triumphalist victory narrative that oh well, you know, in the 40s we defeated Germany and then later on we defeated the Soviet Union and then later on Japan was never quite the economic threat that you know the emperor wasn't going to sell his land and then buy all of the land in California because that was how much the palace was worth. Um, and I fear that China is a much more formidable competitor in part because it is just so much bigger.

是的，我认为美国自满这一点说得非常好，因为美国可以援引这种胜利主义的叙事，哦，你知道，在 40 年代我们击败了德国，后来我们击败了苏联，再后来日本在经济上从未构成那种威胁，你知道，天皇不会把他的土地卖掉然后买下加州所有的土地，因为那值皇宫的价钱。我担心中国是一个更强大的竞争对手，部分原因就是它大得多。

It's four times the population perhaps economy roughly on par by some measures to the US. It has a much stronger manufacturing base. It has some um advantages. It has some disadvantages. But one other advantage is that the Chinese Communist Party is a very good student of history. It saw what went wrong with Japan throughout the mostly the 1980s um with all of its economic problems. It really intensively studies the Soviet Union as well as its political failures. It is really intent not to repeat these sort of mistakes.

它的人口可能是美国的四倍，经济规模与美国大致相当（按某些标准衡量）。它拥有更强大的制造业基础。它有一些优势，也有一些劣势。但另一个优势是，中国共产党是一个非常好的历史学生。它看到了日本在整个 20 世纪 80 年代因经济问题所犯的错误。它深入研究了苏联及其政治失败。它非常致力于不重复这些错误。

And when you combine that with all of other of um China's advantages, what I want to say is that the competition I believe between the US and China will last for decades. it will not um be solved uh or resolved through any single technology not even a technology as crucial as artificial intelligence. um they're going to be you know one country will become stronger um let's say if um if China is much stronger um than the US China will feel overconfident it's going to make mistakes and that's going to prompt the US to try to race faster as well and vice versa and so what I I I think it is just really unlikely that either country will just implode and fail to get back up rather we should be preparing and thinking about a pretty formidable competitor I yeah I definitely I I definitely agree with that and I and I think that, like I said, my biggest worry is just is is complacency from our own, you know, like Detroit is the classic example of complacency in the US where, you know, Japan made cars.

当你把这一点与中国所有的其他优势结合起来时，我想说的是，我相信美国和中国之间的竞争将持续数十年。它不会通过任何单一技术来解决，甚至不是人工智能这样关键的技术。一个国家会变得更强……比如说，如果中国比美国强大得多，中国会感到过度自信，会犯错误，这会促使美国也加速竞争，反之亦然。所以，我认为任何一个国家都不太可能内爆并无法恢复，我们应该为面对一个强大的竞争对手做好准备和思考。我完全同意这一点，而且正如我所说，我最大的担忧就是我们自己的自满情绪。底特律就是美国自满的典型例子，当时日本制造汽车。

They they actually used their lawyers and they went to the government and basically solved their their car problems by having the government either bail them out and or through a combination of just making it harder for Japan to to do business in the US and sell their cars. Germany. You know, one of the things that always through the 70s and 80s that surprised Americans was why are there so many German cars all over Europe when they would go visit Europe? And it's like, well, and then you would drive them and it became this big thing. Wow, these cars are really, really good. And then we did everything we could to make them expensive. And so now they're the most expensive cars and they have the luxury market, but you know, they don't have trucks.

他们实际上是利用律师去找政府，基本上通过政府的救助或通过让日本在美国做生意和销售汽车变得更加困难来解决他们汽车行业的问题。德国。你知道，在 70 年代和 80 年代一直让美国人感到惊讶的一件事是，为什么他们去欧洲旅行时，到处都是德国汽车？然后你开一开就会觉得，哇，这些车真的很棒。然后我们尽一切努力让它们变贵。所以现在它们是最贵的汽车，占据了豪华市场，但它们没有卡车。

And I and I and I think that those lessons and then you know certainly like in the world of software you know we spent a long time like thinking I don't know Japan doesn't seem to have its act together on software and then sure enough here's China marching through oh we're going to make red flag Linux and we're going to make our own CPUs and those have all failed and then one day you're like wow like Huawei looks pretty good like and I was just I was in Japan last week playing with the Chinese phones which you can't really do here and they're all fine. Yeah, like like like if they were to be able to sell them here, which you know is a challenge, you know, those phones would all be these share leaders and it wouldn't just be Samsung in the AT&T store, for example.

而且我想，这些教训……在软件领域，你知道我们花了很多时间思考，不知道日本的软件业务是不是还没搞定，然后中国就大踏步前进，“我们要制造红旗 Linux，我们要制造自己的 CPU”，这些都失败了。然后有一天你会想，哇，华为看起来很不错，我上周刚在日本玩了中国的手机（你在这里很难做到），它们都挺好的。如果它们能在这里销售，这是一个挑战，但这些手机本可以占据市场主导地位，而不仅仅是像 AT&T 商店里的三星那样。

### 中国学习速度与美国制造业的停滞

Yeah. And here's um I mean I wonder if you agree with this proposition that um over the last let's call it 15 years China has gotten a lot better at software and um over the last 15 years uh the U and um it it is already really good also at hardware and over the last 15 years the US has a lead on software no question about that but it's uh manufacturing and hardware has not gotten that much better so the Chinese are learning at a much faster rate and patching up their deficiencies than the Americans are.

是的。我想知道你是否同意这个观点：在过去的 15 年里，中国在软件方面变得更好了，而且在硬件方面也已经非常出色。在过去的 15 年里，美国在软件方面领先，这一点毫无疑问，但在制造业和硬件方面，进步却没有那么大。所以中国在弥补自身不足方面的学习速度比美国快得多。

Yeah, we have really only two companies doing a good job on on hardware, which is the constellation of Elon Companies and and Apple and and after that we run out and so we have all of our bets are are there. I I do think I I will be interested in seeing over time there is a cultural difference and I I think some of it just comes from the scale and the the wages and the need to appeal to a whole broader economy.

是的，我们在硬件方面做得好的公司真的只有两家：埃隆旗下的公司群和苹果。除此之外就没有了，我们所有的赌注都在那里。我确实认为，随着时间的推移，会存在文化差异，我认为其中一部分来自于规模、工资以及迎合更广泛经济体的需求。

the there is a quantitative difference in quality. Um you know that you you can really measure on on the Chinese products. I I think that the the phones are good. They're like what I would say is they're good enough.

中国产品的质量存在量化差异。我认为这些手机是好的，我更愿意称之为“足够好”。

Yeah. But and the software is good enough. And actually I I think you alluded to like also the buildings are kind of good enough and the bridges aren't going to last as long as the Brooklyn Bridge. You know, they they're not built for that. They're not designed for that. And certainly that was, you know, our apartment was falling apart and it was brand new and we we used to just laugh about this constantly and and but I I think that our challenge is we we don't have a quantity. I mean I like I thought it would be good people should understand the scale of China. I know that sounds like a cliche but I don't think people really understand it.

是的。软件也“足够好”。而且，正如你所暗示的，这些建筑也“足够好”，但桥梁的寿命不会像布鲁克林大桥那么长。它们不是为长久而建或设计的。当然，我们那套公寓虽然是全新的，但已经开始破旧了，我们对此经常开玩笑。但我认为我们的挑战在于，我们没有这种数量级的概念。我想让人们了解中国的规模，我知道这听起来很老套，但我认为人们真的不理解。

So, let me just put my scale and then you you update it. Cuz when we were first opening up all the Microsoft offices in China, the person we hired to be the the head of China said, um, well, you have to have an office in every city that's more than 2 million people, which in the US would not be a lot of maybe broad metropolitan areas, but not the cities. And we're like, well, how many is that? And they said 30. And we're like, well, there's no country we have 30. We don't have 30 offices in the US. And but, you know, how about 10 million? Oh, well, there's just two of those. And so, here we are today and I think there's 18 cities with 10 million.

所以，让我先说一下我的规模感受，然后你来更新它。因为当我们第一次在中国开设微软办公室时，我们雇佣的中国区负责人说：“你需要在每个拥有 200 万以上人口的城市设立办公室。”在美国，这可能对应不了多少大都市区，更不用说城市了。我们问：“那有多少个？”他们说 30 个。我们说：“没有哪个国家有 30 个，我们在美国都没有 30 个办公室。”然后我们问：“那 1000 万人口的城市呢？”他们说：“只有两个。”而今天，我认为有 18 个城市拥有 1000 万人口。

I mean, that's and and I don't think you could count how many. I mean, 2 million is like a town, right? Right. Right. Yes. Yes. Um I mean, China scale is real and um the sort of broad statistics that I like to highlight is that China is responsible for about a third of manufacturing value added globally.

我说的是，我觉得你数不清有多少个 200 万人口的城市，那几乎算是一个城镇了。是的。中国的规模是真实的，我喜欢强调的一个广泛统计数据是，中国占全球制造业增加值的大约三分之一。

Um if we take a look at you know almost any particular industry whether that's structural steel or solar photoics China can represent as much as 90%. And there's a couple of really crucial industries that China has almost a total choke hold over. We saw this most prominently with rare earth magnets um this year after Trump imposed sky-high tariffs about of about 150%. China retaliated with not only raising tariffs really high as well, but it suspended exports of rare earth magnets.

如果我们看看几乎任何一个特定行业，无论是结构钢还是太阳能光伏，中国都能占到多达 90%。有几家至关重要的行业几乎被中国完全扼住了咽喉。今年最突出的是稀土磁铁，在特朗普征收高达 150% 的关税后，中国不仅报复性地提高了关税，还暂停了稀土磁铁的出口。

And then a lot of automakers across the west started to panic because they couldn't manufacture their cars anymore. And that's not China's only card. China is also really dominant in a lot of things that include antibiotics, um, segments of fermented antibiotics, namely ibuprofen, um, and other active pharmaceutical ingredients. China could totally uh constrain the world's ability to make solar uh to deploy solar for for a while. And so this is where I I'm taking a look at a couple of particular industries where they have choke points and they could really hurt the West if it doesn't build enough.

然后西方许多汽车制造商开始恐慌，因为他们无法再制造汽车了。但这还不是中国的全部筹码。中国在许多领域也占据主导地位，包括抗生素，特别是发酵抗生素的部分，即布洛芬，以及其他活性药物成分。中国可以完全限制世界在一段时间内制造或部署太阳能的能力。因此，我关注的是一些关键行业，如果西方不能建立足够的产能，这些行业中的瓶颈可能会真正伤害到西方。

### 医药行业的战略重要性与地方反对的困境

Yeah, I I'm just personally particularly worried about pharma the most and I think that one's particularly interesting because we have all this pressure in the US to light loosen the regulatory climate for for pharma. But the problem is China's regulatory climate is is very loose. And I worry about, you know, we we see it all the time with like, oh, you know, people are testing like they went to the CVS and they got the same antibiotic in three different generics and they're actually kind of not what they say they are or they're not nearly the level of quality or purity that they should be or purity that they should be.

我个人最担心的是制药业。我认为这一点尤其有趣，因为美国一直面临着放松对制药业监管环境的压力。但问题是中国这里的监管环境非常宽松。我担心……我们经常看到这种情况，比如人们检测他们在 CVS 拿到的同一种抗生素，但来自三个不同的仿制药，它们实际上与其声称的有所不符，或者它们的质量和纯度远未达到应有的水平。

And and so I I think we need to like pharma is the most strategic and important one that we need to build up be because it's the one that also we we had the highest safety standards in the world for for leading it. And so my hope is that's and it's such a straightforward one in a I mean we used to make them all in Delaware and and stuff and that just seems to have gone away in New Jersey and that seems to have gone away.

所以，我认为制药业是最具战略意义和最重要的，我们需要加强这一领域，因为它也是我们曾经在世界范围内拥有最高安全标准来引领的领域。我希望如此，而且这是一个很直接的问题，我们过去都在特拉华州等地制造这些产品，现在它们似乎已经转移到了新泽西州，并消失了。

A lot of our approach in terms of catching up on manufacturing seems to be around industrial policy and picking winners sort of following some maybe the approach that China and Japan have have taken to some degree. Do you think that's the that's the right approach or what would you come in on that?

我们追赶制造业的方法似乎围绕着产业政策和“挑选赢家”，有点像在一定程度上遵循了中国和日本所采取的方法。你认为那是正确的做法吗？你对此有什么看法？

### 广义的产业政策与基础设施建设

Yeah well I think industrial policy could be defined as broadly as we like Eric. So um let's just define it really broadly. This could uh involve also the creation and deployment of better sources of infrastructure. Um again I come back to not only traditional infrastructure like ports and um you know railroads that move around a lot of goods but also um China has a lot of um data connectivity.

是的，我认为产业政策可以像我们希望的那样广泛定义，埃里克。所以，让我们把它定义得非常广泛。这也可以涉及更好基础设施来源的创建和部署。我再次回到传统基础设施，比如港口和运输大量货物的铁路，同时也……中国拥有很多数据连接。

Um they build just enormous fleets of nuclear power stations. Um you know there's something like um something like 40 nuclear um plants under construction in the world and 35 of them are in China right now. And the US is barely building out um enough of the nuclear plants. It's not um President Trump now is pretty unfriendly towards wind turbines. He keeps tweeting about this sort of stuff.

他们建造了巨大的核电站群。你知道，世界上大约有 40 座核电站正在建设中，其中 35 座在中国。而美国几乎没有建设足够多的核电站。现在特朗普总统对风力涡轮机相当不友好，他一直在发推文谈论这类事情。

Um and uh we industrial policy could also be defined in terms of education um in terms of you know giving more money to some of our most functioning um university labs or national laboratories to get them to deploy technologies quite a lot better. Maybe it could also involve workforce training. um it doesn't all have to involve giving um money to Intel. You know, are we even picking uh winners here when we give a lot of money to Intel? Intel hasn't been doing very well.

而且，我们的产业政策也可以用教育来定义，比如向我们一些运转最正常的大学实验室或国家实验室提供更多资金，让他们更好地部署技术。也许它还应该包括劳动力培训。它不一定都涉及给英特尔钱。你知道，当我们给英特尔很多钱的时候，我们甚至是在挑选“赢家”吗？英特尔的表现一直不太好。

So, I say that let's um have a broader definition of industrial policy. We don't have to call it industrial policy. Let's call it national competitiveness. But right now, I would say that the trend for the US has just not been doing very well. So, let's try something else.

所以，我的意思是，让我们对产业政策有一个更广泛的定义。我们不必称之为产业政策，我们可以称之为国家竞争力。但目前来看，美国的趋势一直不太好，所以我们应该尝试一些新的方法。

### 法律程序对基础设施建设的阻碍

Yeah. I think and I think to build on what you were saying earlier, I I think the lawyer side of us needs to focus it's just as important to broadly define it as you know we want these things to happen and we're not going to saddle them with ancillary requirements you know and and so much of of the challenge has been like oh yeah we want you to do this but we also like rare earths you know rare earths are real challenge it's a kind of a weird name there it's not that there are super rare elements it's that They're they're just called that in chemistry, but that they're really really difficult to get out of the ground and process and turn into useful products.

是的，我认为，承接你刚才所说的，我们“律师”那一方需要专注于这一点：我们必须像你所说的那样广泛地定义它，即我们希望这些事情发生，并且我们不会给它们附加额外的要求。很多挑战在于，哦，我们希望你做这个，但我们还希望……比如稀土，你知道稀土是一个真正的挑战，它有一个奇怪的名字，并不是说元素本身非常稀有，而是它们在化学中就是这样称呼的，但它们真的很难从地下开采、加工并转化为有用的产品。

And our part of the reason we don't like doing it here is because of those environmental downsides. But the flip side is we we we have to be able to do them. And the same with pharma. Like people don't like chemical plants near where they live. And we have a lot of history that says that gets to be problematic over time. So we we need to be able to figure out how to get things done not just by like encouraging but by also putting barriers around the barriers.

我们不愿在这里做的部分原因是环境污染。但另一方面，我们必须能够做到。制药业也是如此。人们不喜欢住在化工厂附近，我们有很多历史经验表明这会随着时间的推移而产生问题。所以我们需要想出如何把事情做成，不仅是通过鼓励，还要在障碍周围设置障碍。

Yeah. Otherwise people can't invest. You know, you can't it it all everything turns into sort of commercial real estate where you have to be this very special breed of person that has like a 60-year time horizon to build one building. And that's and that's really the challenge.

是的。否则人们就无法投资。你知道，一切都变成了一种商业地产模式，你必须是那种拥有 60 年时间视野才能盖一栋楼的特殊人才。这才是真正的挑战。

I mean with something like rare earths, we absolutely need them and they're absolutely super polluting. If we take a look at some of the rare earth processing facilities around China, the cancer rates are off the charts. In California, this is a totally nimi state. You know, I can't imagine that any homeowner will say, "Yes, let's have a rare earth processor in my backyard."

比如稀土，我们绝对需要它们，但它们也绝对是高度污染的。如果我们看看中国周围的一些稀土加工设施，癌症发病率非常高。在加州，这是一个完全“邻避”（NIMBY）的州。我无法想象任何房主会说：“是的，让我们在我的后院建一个稀土加工厂。”

Even in places like Nevada, which is mostly, you know, high which is mostly desert, hot desert, um, you know, there were a lot of protests about putting some nuclear waste at Yaka Mountain and that was like a pretty remote place, right? So I I I don't see how we get from here to there.

即使在内华达州这样大部分是沙漠、炎热沙漠的地方，人们也对在尤卡山（Yaka Mountain）放置核废料进行了大量抗议，那里相当偏远，对吧？所以我不知道我们如何能解决这个问题。

Um a lot of these rare earths discussions that I saw from the Biden administration was let's make the Canadians do it. And so you know this was not a really ambitious project to say okay well we got to figure out some remote part of California um you know some part of the west where there's a ton of federal land. The one thing we have is remote. We have a lot of remote that it's also fairly accessible and it's federal land you know so why why don't we just build there and yet we can't. And yet we can't. So that's the challenge.

我看到的拜登政府关于稀土的许多讨论都是“让加拿大人去做”。所以，这算不上一个雄心勃勃的项目，就是想说，好吧，我们得在加州某个偏远的地方，你知道，西部有大量联邦土地的地方想办法。我们唯一拥有的就是偏远地区。我们有很多偏远地区，而且交通相对便利，那是联邦土地，所以我们为什么不直接在那里建造呢？但我们做不到。这就是挑战所在。

### 中国工程驱动的外交政策与美国的联盟体系

Yeah. Um Dan, I want you to compare and contrast uh American and China's approach to foreign policy and how that impacts the the the competition as we think about it.

是的。丹，我想让你比较一下美国和中国的外交政策方针，以及这如何影响我们所考虑的竞争格局。

Yeah. Well, America has been a global power for a very long time. Um there's what let's say 100 countries or maybe 50 countries where there's um um American military bases. there's a lot of people who would um really like the America to the United States to have their back and China um has not built this network of alliances. It doesn't have that much trust. It doesn't have that much trust even um among its near neighbors um all of whom have something to fear from Chinese power.

是的。美国长期以来一直是一个全球大国。大概有 100 个国家或 50 个国家有美军基地。很多人希望美国能支持他们。而中国还没有建立起这种联盟网络，它没有那么多的信任，甚至在其近邻中也没有多少信任，因为这些邻国都对中国的力量有所忌惮。

There have been a few wars. There's been quite a few wars. Um and I think for me what um the way that I would characterize um China's foreign policy is that it's very engineer driven. Um they the way that they conduct a lot of diplomacy in Africa and Southeast Asia as well as Latin America is just to go up to these countries and build some roads, build some light rail, build some ports.

发生过一些战争。我认为，我描述中国外交政策的方式是，它是高度由工程师驱动的。他们处理在非洲、东南亚以及拉丁美洲的外交方式，就是去这些国家修建一些道路、轻轨、港口。

And I think for the most part that's pretty positive. Um a lot of these countries really do need a lot of functional infrastructure. Um, China is really good at building these at home, but it's found that it hasn't been super good at building um these more locally. It hasn't been able to, you know, build effectively and uh cleanly and um, you know, in a way that satisfies a lot of political elites over there.

我认为在大多数情况下，这是积极的。很多国家确实需要大量的功能性基础设施。中国在国内擅长建设这些，但它发现自己在当地建设这些东西并不那么擅长。它未能有效地、干净地建设，也未能以令当地许多政治精英满意的方式建设。

Otherwise, I think that, you know, China's um, foreign policy has been not terribly ambitious. Um, a couple of months ago, there was this minor border skirmish between um, Cambodia as well as Thailand. And so there were some some troops that died uh in this uh fatal conflict. And was it China that the regional power that really stepped up to mediate uh with that conflict? Actually, it was mostly mediated by I believe Malaysia. So it wasn't the US or or Beijing that did something about this. This was Malaysia.

否则，我认为中国的……外交政策并不算太宏大。几个月前，柬埔寨和泰国之间发生了一次小规模的边境冲突，有一些士兵在这次致命冲突中丧生。是区域大国中国站出来调解这次冲突吗？实际上，调解者主要是马来西亚。不是美国或北京在处理这件事，而是马来西亚。

Um China has pissed off a lot of um Europeans who are not very happy about Trump by engaging in wolf warrior diplomacy as if insulting these countries is the way to make friends. That's also been um very very strange.

中国还激怒了许多欧洲人，他们对特朗普并不满意，因为中国采取了“战狼外交”，好像侮辱这些国家是交朋友的方式。这也非常奇怪。

And in any sort of global conflict, China will have will issue Beijing will issue these statements to say well maybe things between um Israel and Palestine should calm down and maybe you know Russia and Ukraine should um you know be friends but they also don't really do anything to to have stakes here. And so I think that um the engineering states uh foreign policy is still mostly to build stuff rather than get really deeply involved in um a way that America has actually achieved and make friends and build alliances in a way that um America seems to be mostly walking away from now.

在任何全球冲突中，中国都会发表声明，比如以色列和巴勒斯坦之间应该冷静下来，俄罗斯和乌克兰之间应该做朋友，但他们也不会真正采取任何行动来承担后果。因此，我认为“工程国家”的外交政策仍然主要侧重于建设，而不是像美国那样深入参与，建立友谊和联盟，而美国现在似乎正逐步放弃这一点。

### 交易型外交与维护的不足

Yeah, it's super interesting that I love your characterization of of their foreign policy as engineering. Like if you go to Africa like take Madagascar which is arguably the poorest country in the world you know like to go see to land in the capital city and go see to go see chocolate and lemurs you know it's this 100 mile 100 km drive and China came in and and but there's all this aluminum and metals in the same place and China came in and just said hey we'll build you with a railroad and and the French had built one and then it deteriorated then China came in but the French were colonizing ing the area.

是的，你将他们的外交政策描述为“工程学”，这非常有趣。比如去非洲的马达加斯加，那可以说是世界上最贫穷的国家之一。你在首都降落，想去看巧克力和狐猴，那里有 100 公里的路程。中国来了，那个地方还有很多铝和金属，中国说：“嘿，我们给你建条铁路。”法国人以前建过一条，后来它恶化了，然后中国来了。法国当时在殖民那个地区。

Whereas China came in and said, "Oh, we'll build you a railroad and we're going to just build a village where we live and we won't even bother you." And like literally, you could go if you wanted Chinese food, you just turned left and you went to the Chinese part of town and they never bothered anybody. And then if you wanted Malagasi food, you they just said, "Hey, come here and we'll give you chocolate and cool spices and stuff." And they no, they never bother us.

而中国来后说：“哦，我们会为你建一条铁路，我们还会建一个我们居住的村庄，我们甚至不会打扰你。”如果你想吃中餐，你左转就能走到华人区，他们从不打扰任何人。如果你想吃马达加斯加食物，他们就会说：“嘿，来这里，我们会给你巧克力和很酷的香料之类的东西。”他们从不打扰我们。

And so in a way they they got the engineering the transaction is I think what the state department the way they say it is it's very transactionoriented. Here's the train and now we're going to extract and leave you alone. But then also once the extraction is done or once it's it's normalized then that infrastructure isn't super wellmaintained. It's not expansive.

所以，从某种意义上说，他们得到了工程方面的成果。我认为国务院所说的就是，这非常以交易为导向：“这是火车，现在我们要从中提取价值然后离开你们。”但一旦提取完成或事情常态化后，这种基础设施往往维护得不好，也不再扩张。

And and yet the flip side is like countries Latin America saw like what happens when the US came in and so in a sense what I'm hearing and also what I believe is that the world needs a different kind of foreign policy that is much more to use a Chinese phrase much more of a win-win than than either country currently sets it up to be.

但另一方面，拉丁美洲国家看到了美国介入后会发生什么。所以，我的理解和相信的是，世界需要一种不同类型的外交政策，用中国的话来说，这种政策应该是一种比任何一个国家目前设定的都要“双赢”的政策。

### 台湾问题的展望：时间站在谁的一边？

Sure. Well, the State Department also says that um when China talks about women diplomacy, it's about China winning twice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's exactly I mean like Madagascar is still the poorest country and now they have sort of half a railroad and less aluminum, right?

当然。国务院还说，当中国谈论“友女外交”（Women Diplomacy，此处应指“友善外交”或某种外交策略）时，意味着中国要赢两次。是的，是的。这正是如此，比如马达加斯加仍然是最贫穷的国家，现在他们只有半条铁路和更少的铝，对吧？

You know, speaking about foreign policy, um thinking about the the the short to to medium term here, one of the biggest questions, of course, is is Taiwan in 2027. what are the things you're um watching to sort of get a better read on on what what could possibly happen and what's what's your base case on you know how how it plays out?

谈到外交政策，我们来看看短期到中期最大的问题之一，当然是 2027 年的台湾问题。你正在关注哪些迹象来更好地判断可能发生什么？你对事态如何发展的基础判断是什么？

Yeah. Well, I want to quote from um the great analyst uh Ben Thompson here who recently moved um back to the US from Taiwan and his assessment is that there's always a lot of risks out there but um in his view the um there conflict between Beijing and Taipei is not imminent and not inevitable. And that's kind of my view.

是的。我想引用伟大的分析师本·汤普森（Ben Thompson）的话，他最近从台湾搬回了美国。他的评估是，风险总是在那里，但根据他的观点，北京和台北之间的冲突并非迫在眉睫，也非不可避免。这也是我的看法。

I feel like there is no um deadline that um Beijing has issued to say we will seize uh the Taiwan island by 2027. Maybe they want to be ready to do it. Um but I think you know so long as Beijing feels that the long-term trends favor China and that is their publicly stated position that China is growing wealthier it's growing more powerful it is um you know getting more confident at the same time um while the US appears to be falling you know Beijing likes to say the east is rising and the west is falling and perhaps they take some um solace from the messiness of American in society right now in 2025 that um they feel that time is on their side if they have some sort of hope that the Taiwanese could themselves really vote themselves to be part of the mainland again um that looks pretty unlikely now but maybe they get a um KMT government which is more friendly towards Beijing so long as they um believe in all of that then I think they have no urgency really to move and I think that the status quo has been pretty robust for the last 75 years now and maybe that could hold for quite a few years longer.

我觉得北京没有发出一个“我们必须在 2027 年前夺取台湾岛”的最后通牒。也许他们想做好准备。但我想，只要北京认为长期趋势有利于中国——这是他们公开的立场——即中国正在变得更富裕、更强大、更自信，而美国似乎正在衰落——北京喜欢说“东方正在崛起，西方正在衰落”，也许他们对美国目前（2025年）社会上的混乱感到一丝安慰，他们觉得时间站在他们这边。如果他们仍然抱有希望，认为台湾人可能会投票决定重新加入大陆——这现在看起来不太可能——但也许他们能选出一个对北京更友好的国民党政府。只要他们相信这一切，我认为他们就没有紧迫性去采取行动，而且我认为过去 75 年来的现状相当稳固，或许还能再维持好几年。

### 经济放缓和人口结构不会迫使中国立即行动

And so you're not worried about some people say because of sort of the demographic situation or because of sort of China's you know sort of economic you know some somewhat slowdown that uh they're going to be forced to to sort of you know make a hand here while they while they have it. You think it's unlikely?

那么，你并不担心，有些人认为，由于人口结构或中国经济某种程度的放缓，他们会被迫在拥有优势时采取行动。你认为这不太可能吗？

Yeah, I think that China's demographic situation is a problem uh more in the next 50 years rather than the next 5 years. the slope, the curve of their demographic decline is pretty modest. I mean, they still have 1.4 billion people or just shy of that now. It's not that many people that they're losing every single year.

是的，我认为中国的人口问题更多地体现在未来 50 年，而不是未来 5 年。他们人口下降的斜率和曲线相当平缓。我的意思是，他们现在仍然有 14 亿人口，或接近这个数字。他们每年失去的人口数量并不算多。

And their economy, you know, you can debate what exactly the the number is, but they um publicly say something like 5% growth. And there is still growth there. And there is still all sorts of, you know, new business creation there and all sorts of um fantastic new technological advancements there. And so I don't think they view themselves to be fundamentally weak and that there's a window that they must act in before it closes.

他们的经济，你可以争论确切的数字，但他们公开表示仍在以 5% 左右的速度增长。那里仍然有增长，仍然有各种新的商业创造，仍然有各种出色的技术进步。所以我不认为他们认为自己从根本上是软弱的，或者必须在一个即将关闭的窗口期内采取行动。

### 竞争的本质：持续的磨合而非一方的崩溃

What I appreciate about about the about the book is right now in the intellectual conversation around China, I feel like there's the two extremes where you have this sort of extreme bearishness like the Zhan view of hey because of sort of demographics because of sort of limitations around food and energy uh you know he thinks they're going to implode in in the next decade.

我欣赏这本书的一点是，目前围绕中国的思想讨论中存在两个极端：一种是极度看空，比如詹（Zhan，可能是指某位分析师）的观点，认为由于人口和粮食、能源的限制，中国将在未来十年内崩溃。

And then there's the sort of, you know, BI but many others who are like, hey, they have many more people and they're smarter and they're just winning on so many things and it's only going going to compound. And I feel like you have a more sober view uh to some degree, which is, hey, America's got unique strengths and and weaknesses and and China's got unique strengths and weaknesses and it's going to be there is no implosion. Um, when one side is ahead, the other side will overstep and then the then and then they'll need to catch up.

然后是另一种观点，比如 BI（可能是指另一位分析师）和许多其他人认为，他们人口更多、更聪明，在很多方面都在获胜，而且这种优势只会不断累积。我觉得你有一种更清醒的看法，那就是：嘿，美国有其独特的优势和劣势，中国也有其独特的优势和劣势，不会有任何一方完全崩溃。当一方领先时，另一方就会越界，然后他们需要追赶上来。

And so I want to say that there is no winner here, there is no loser here. It's not a race. Nobody gets to hit the win button. Um, and I think we should just take this as a slow, steady grind that will require all of us to get better in all sorts of ways.

所以我想说的是，这里没有赢家，也没有输家。这不是一场比赛，没有人能按下胜利按钮。我认为我们应该将其视为一场缓慢、稳定的磨合，它将要求我们所有人都在各个方面变得更好。

I think it's a great place to wrap. The book is Breakneck. Dan, thanks so much for coming on the podcast. Thank you, Eric. Thank you, Stephen. Thanks so much.
