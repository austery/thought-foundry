### 坚守愿景：出售与坚持的抉择

Ali: Maybe they're right. Maybe we should just sell. And I remember having that conversation with Ben.
Ali: He said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. You can sell. You're going to make a lot of money and you'll be super successful in life."
Ali: "But if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, 'I missed that one shot. That was the one thing I should have taken it all the way. Now I'll never know how far I could have taken it.'"
Ali: "So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less."

Ali: 也许他们是对的。也许我们应该直接卖掉公司。我记得和本（Ben）有过那次对话。
Ali: 他说：“嘿，你想怎么做都行。你可以卖掉公司。你会赚很多钱，人生也会非常成功。”
Ali: “但如果你像我一样，你会在余生中回望，心想‘我错过了那一次机会。那是我应该坚持到底的一件事。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。’”
Ali: “所以，你愿意带着这种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有金钱？你想做什么我都支持。我真的无所谓。”

### 重启“老板谈话”：Databricks早期挑战

Host: Excited to bring back Boss Talk. This was a series that you guys did a few years ago on Clubhouse that was a big hit.

Host: 很高兴能再次带来**Boss Talk**（老板谈话：一个访谈系列）。这是你们几年前在**Clubhouse**（Clubhouse: 一个基于音频的社交媒体平台）上做的一个系列，当时非常成功。

Ali: We had fun. It was Ben's idea. Excited to bring it back.
Ali: So, in the spirit of Boss Talk, let's talk about the first time that you became a boss in terms of running Databricks.
Ali: Let's talk about the moment in 2016 when Databricks wasn't as smooth as perhaps it should have been and we were looking for a new CEO.
Ali: Ben, you recommended Ali. First of all, kudos to Yan for building the company originally, and Ben, investing and believing in us.
Ali: And then also, I couldn't have done the CEO job. Ben basically babysat me the first couple of years.
Ali: But I did know what was wrong with the company because I had been there for two, three years and I had seen from inside what we should change and what the issues were.
Ali: But we had an **open source** (开源: 软件源代码公开，允许自由使用、修改和分发) project that actually became very successful thanks to those first two, three years.

Ali: 我们玩得很开心。那是本的主意。很高兴能再次带来这个系列。
Ali: 所以，本着“老板谈话”的精神，我们来谈谈你第一次作为老板运营**Databricks**（Databricks: 一家提供数据湖平台服务的软件公司）的时候。
Ali: 让我们谈谈2016年的那个时刻，当时Databricks的运营并不如预期顺利，我们正在寻找一位新的**CEO**（首席执行官: 负责公司整体运营和战略的最高级管理人员）。
Ali: 本，你推荐了阿里。首先，要赞扬彦（Yan）最初创建了公司，以及本对我们的投资和信任。
Ali: 另外，我当时也无法胜任CEO的工作。本在前几年基本上是手把手地指导我。
Ali: 但我确实知道公司出了什么问题，因为我已经在那里待了两三年，并且从内部看到了我们应该改变什么以及存在的问题。
Ali: 不过，我们有一个开源项目，由于最初的两三年，它变得非常成功。

### Apache Spark的崛起与挑战

Ali: **Apache Spark** (Apache Spark: 一个用于大规模数据处理的开源统一分析引擎) became a worldwide sensation, and we could pride ourselves on the number of downloads of the software.

Ali: Apache Spark风靡全球，我们可以为软件的下载量感到自豪。

Host: Well, and the Spark conference.

Host: 还有Spark大会。

Ali: Spark conference.

Ali: Spark大会。

Host: Now the Data and AI conference.

Host: 现在是数据与人工智能大会。

Ali: But the problem was that, as it is often with open source, everyone's just downloading the open source version.

Ali: 但问题是，就像开源项目常有的情况一样，每个人都只下载开源版本。

Ben: Actually, your biggest enemy is your open source project. The main thing you have to fight in the market is, "Hey, why can't I just download the open source version? Amazon is offering it, the **cloud vendors** (云服务商: 提供云计算服务的公司) are just offering it. I'm just going to use that."

Ben: 实际上，你最大的敌人就是你的开源项目。你在市场上必须面对的主要问题是：“嘿，我为什么不能只下载开源版本？亚马逊在提供，云服务商也在提供。我直接用那个不就行了。”

Ali: So, this was the biggest challenge that Databricks had at the time, and we needed to do very serious, aggressive pivots internally, which were going to be very, very painful to lots of people, like to the whole ethos of the company internally.
Ali: So I kind of knew that for almost a year. So when I got the shot, that's what we started doing.

Ali: 所以，这是Databricks当时面临的最大挑战，我们内部需要进行非常认真、激进的转型，这对很多人来说会非常痛苦，甚至影响到公司内部的整体精神。
Ali: 我大概知道这一点已经将近一年了。所以当我得到机会时，我们便开始着手进行这些改变。

Ben: The strategy was to make Spark the biggest open source thing. I can remember it on all the slides now. And then Databricks would have the best Spark.
Ben: But Databricks never had, we didn't do a lot to make it the best Spark or not differentiated enough.
Ben: And that was kind of the first thing Ali did on the product side.
Ben: And then he hired Ron Gabrisco, which was transformational, because that kind of dragged the company into the world.

Ben: 策略是让Spark成为最热门的开源项目。我现在还能回想起所有幻灯片上的内容。然后Databricks会拥有最好的Spark。
Ben: 但Databricks从未真正做到，我们没有做太多努力使其成为最好的Spark，或者说差异化不够。
Ben: 这就是阿里在产品方面做的第一件事。
Ben: 然后他雇佣了罗恩·加布里斯科（Ron Gabrisco），这是一个变革性的举动，因为它把公司带入了市场。

Host: So obviously that was the right decision and paid off.
Host: Maybe zooming out, Ben, you've worked with and you know all the great CEOs of our time and worked with them.
Host: Where does Ali spike in? Where are his superpowers as a CEO, as a boss, that have helped contribute to the impact?

Host: 显然，那是个正确的决定，并且得到了回报。
Host: 也许从更宏观的角度来看，本，你曾与我们这个时代所有伟大的CEO合作过，并且了解他们。
Host: 阿里在哪方面表现突出？作为一名CEO，作为一名老板，他的超能力是什么，这些能力又如何帮助公司取得了成就？

### Ali作为CEO的超能力：技术深度与果断决策

Ben: Ali's really good. I always rate CEOs. It's like, "Okay, if I was running that company, would I do a better job or a worse job?"
Ben: And with Databricks, I'd do a way worse job.
Ben: So, he's good on many, many dimensions. First of all, he is a real technologist, not a pseudo technologist, like his competitors. I'm sorry.
Ben: So he really knows the product. He understands the product strategy in detail.
Ben: He also ran engineering before he was CEO. Mostly what I worked with him on in the early days was just **go-to-market** (进入市场策略: 公司将产品或服务推向市场的计划) and **BD** (业务发展: 建立战略伙伴关系和关系的活动).
Ben: And he's really good at both of those. That's where we had to catch up. Snowflake had an amazing go-to-market.
Ben: And then we needed a big deal with big partners. Every time I got him a little BD tutor, John O'Farrell, who did a nice job, came in and taught Ali about how you structure a deal, how you do things.
Ben: But he learned everything so fast.
Ben: And then probably the thing that he does that I wish I could get all our CEOs to do is he doesn't hesitate. He trusts his eye.
Ben: He'll see something and he doesn't know if it's right.
Ben: And so, if you look at the strategy changes Databricks has had, one big one was building a **data warehouse** (数据仓库: 用于存储和管理大量历史数据的系统).
Ben: That is a pretty big swing and a seemingly **quixotic** (不切实际的: 极其理想主义、不切实际或异想天开的) insane idea given where they were.
Ben: But he both knew, he's **paranoid** (多疑的: 过分怀疑或不信任他人) enough that he knew that that could be an issue, and then he trusted himself enough to go get deep enough to decide whether to do it or not, as opposed to ignore it like, "These guys are trying to kill me. I don't want to see it."
Ben: Which is what a lot of CEOs do. But there's a lot of elements to that job. It's a very complicated job.

Ben: 阿里真的很棒。我总是对CEO进行评估，就像是：“好吧，如果我来经营这家公司，我会做得更好还是更糟？”
Ben: 而对于Databricks，我肯定会做得更糟。
Ben: 所以，他在很多方面都很出色。首先，他是一位真正的技术专家，而不是像他的竞争对手那样，是一个伪技术专家。抱歉。
Ben: 所以他非常了解产品。他详细理解产品策略。
Ben: 他在担任CEO之前也负责过工程部门。在早期，我主要与他合作的是**进入市场策略**（go-to-market: 公司将产品或服务推向市场的计划）和**业务发展**（BD: 建立战略伙伴关系和关系的活动）。
Ben: 他在这两方面都非常擅长。那是我们需要追赶的地方。Snowflake有一个出色的进入市场策略。
Ben: 然后我们需要与大合作伙伴达成大交易。每次我给他找来一位业务发展导师约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell），他做得很好，他会教阿里如何构建交易、如何处理事务。
Ben: 但他学得非常快。
Ben: 此外，他做的一件事，我希望我们所有CEO都能做到，那就是他从不犹豫。他相信自己的判断。
Ben: 他会看到一些东西，即使不确定它是否正确。
Ben: 因此，如果你看看Databricks经历的战略变化，其中一个重大变化是构建**数据仓库**（data warehouse: 用于存储和管理大量历史数据的系统）。
Ben: 考虑到他们当时所处的位置，那是一个相当大的转变，一个看似**不切实际的**（quixotic: 极其理想主义、不切实际或异想天开的）疯狂想法。
Ben: 但他既知道，他足够**多疑**（paranoid: 过分怀疑或不信任他人），所以他知道那可能是一个问题，然后他又足够相信自己，深入研究以决定是否去做，而不是像很多CEO那样，选择忽略，心想：“这些人想搞垮我，我不想看到这些。”
Ben: 但这份工作有很多要素。这是一份非常复杂的工作。

### 从学者到商业领袖的转型之路

Host: Ali, talk about more about the journey, about evolving from an academic, a technologist, to someone commercial.
Host: It's a journey our CEOs go through. Talk about what it was like for you in the context of what others can learn from it.

Host: 阿里，多谈谈你的旅程，从一个学者、技术专家，转变为一个商业人士。
Host: 这是我们CEO们都会经历的旅程。结合你自己的经历，谈谈别人能从中学习到什么。

Ali: We were in academia, so we were scientists. Then I led engineering and product, so you got to learn how to build a product and get **product-market fit** (产品市场契合: 产品满足市场需求并能有效扩展的程度).
Ali: And then I became CEO afterwards. Each of these has different challenges.
Ali: I think that in all of them, the thing that is in common is that you really have to understand and be extremely good at the task at hand.
Ali: So, number one, admit that you don't actually know everything about the job.
Ali: It's like the first step of **Anonymous Alcoholics** (匿名戒酒会: 一个互助组织，旨在帮助酒精成瘾者戒酒) — admit you have a problem. Okay.
Ali: And then number two, be a student and learn everything you can about it. Go all the way down to the details and try to learn from the best.
Ali: And then work your butt off. Like, you know, you're nothing, you're zero. It's like you know nothing about writing reliable software.
Ali: So I would say that's was the same thing I tried to learn. I tried to network with the best heads of engineering, with the best heads of products.
Ali: I tried to read every book. I got as much as I could out of Ben and Mark. I read all of their blogs, all of their books, everybody else's.
Ali: But then you do search, and you start, you know, search firms are really great at getting you to meet who's the number one product manager by reputation in the market right now.
Ali: Can you get 30 minutes with that person? Just sit down. They're not going to join you because your company is too crappy and too small.
Ali: Can you get 30 minutes with them? Can you get a dinner with them? Can you get a breakfast with them?
Ali: And then just ask them lots and lots and lots of dumb questions, and they'll tell you. They'll happily just tell you, "Hey, here's how I run. Here's how I do it. The other guys are wrong."
Ali: And then they'll give you a playbook, and you can go compare it. You can go to the next person and say, "Hey, this is the playbook I heard."
Ali: Like, "No, no, that's totally wrong. You don't do it that way. Here's how I do it." And then very soon you learn enough.
Ali: And if you really have grit and you work hard, you're going to be able to do great things.
Ali: That's about you yourself. But also, if you hire a great team, because as a leader, you alone can't do much.
Ali: So, can you hire the best people out there? That's also part of that.
Ali: Do you know what great looks like? Have you interviewed all the best people?
Ali: And then can you now sell them and get the best people to come work for you?
Ali: Once you start assembling a team of excellent people, then they will uplift you.

Ali: 我们在学术界，所以我们是科学家。然后我领导工程和产品部门，所以你必须学习如何构建产品并实现**产品市场契合**（product-market fit: 产品满足市场需求并能有效扩展的程度）。
Ali: 之后我才成为CEO。这些阶段都有不同的挑战。
Ali: 我认为所有这些阶段的共同点是，你必须真正理解并极其擅长手头的任务。
Ali: 所以，第一点，承认你并不了解这份工作的一切。
Ali: 这就像**匿名戒酒会**（Anonymous Alcoholics: 一个互助组织，旨在帮助酒精成瘾者戒酒）的第一步——承认你有一个问题。好的。
Ali: 第二点，做一个学生，学习你能学到的一切。深入到细节，努力向最优秀的人学习。
Ali: 然后拼命工作。就像，你一无所知，你是零。就像你对编写可靠软件一无所知。
Ali: 所以我想说，这和我当时努力学习的方式是一样的。我努力与最优秀的工程主管、最优秀的产品主管建立联系。
Ali: 我努力阅读每一本书。我从本和马克（Mark）那里尽可能多地获取知识。我阅读了他们所有的博客，他们所有的书，以及其他所有人的。
Ali: 但接下来你要去寻找，你会发现，猎头公司在帮你找到目前市场上声誉第一的产品经理方面非常出色。
Ali: 你能和那个人谈30分钟吗？坐下来聊聊。他们不会加入你的公司，因为你的公司太烂太小了。
Ali: 你能和他们谈30分钟吗？你能和他们共进晚餐吗？你能和他们共进早餐吗？
Ali: 然后向他们提出大量愚蠢的问题，他们会告诉你。他们会很乐意告诉你：“嘿，我是这样做的。我是这样操作的。其他人都是错的。”
Ali: 然后他们会给你一套行动方案，你可以去比较。你可以去找下一个人说：“嘿，这是我听到的行动方案。”
Ali: 对方可能会说：“不，不，那完全错了。你不能那样做。我是这样做的。”然后很快你就能学到足够多的东西。
Ali: 如果你真的有毅力并且努力工作，你就能做出伟大的事情。
Ali: 那是关于你自己的。但同时，如果你能组建一支优秀的团队，因为作为领导者，你一个人做不了太多。
Ali: 所以，你能雇佣到最优秀的人才吗？这也是其中的一部分。
Ali: 你知道优秀是什么样子吗？你面试过所有最优秀的人吗？
Ali: 然后你能说服他们，让最优秀的人来为你工作吗？
Ali: 一旦你开始组建一支由优秀人才组成的团队，他们就会提升你。

### 雇佣优秀人才与管理杠杆

Ben: This is a managerial leverage that I learned from Ben, which is from **High Output Management** (高产出管理: 安迪·格鲁夫所著的一本关于管理和生产力的书籍) by Andy Grove.
Ben: It's basically, are they so great that you're learning from them?
Ben: It's like Ali was a great head of engineering, but actually he was a great head of engineering because the people that worked underneath me were doing amazing things, and that was I was just standing on their shoulders.
Ben: So you just have to do that, and you have to instill everybody else to do that recursively so that you end up with an amazing killer team, and you got to continue doing that.
Ben: For engineering it wasn't actually that hard, because I had written a lot of software.
Ben: But now you're CEO, so now you have to do that for marketing, you have to do that for sales.
Ben: They were super helpful because they had done it with **LoudCloud** (LoudCloud: 本·霍洛维茨联合创办的一家互联网基础设施公司) and **Opsware** (Opsware: 一家软件公司，后被惠普收购，本·霍洛维茨曾任CEO).
Ben: So they knew how to build a **B2B** (企业对企业: 一种商业模式，指企业间进行产品、服务或信息交换) machine, how the game was played.
Ben: But you have to do it again, but now you're doing it in a field where you're really clueless, and also probably all of your instincts are wrong, and your intuition is completely wrong.
Ben: So, can you be clairvoyant and see the truth, or do you want to lie to yourself?
Ben: And that's where I think a lot of founders make mistakes. They'll do well in their own archetype.
Ben: When they have to step outside of their own archetype, they make a mistake. They hire people that are like their own archetype in other roles where that could be lethal.

Ben: 这是一种我从本那里学到的管理杠杆，它来自安迪·格鲁夫（Andy Grove）的《**高产出管理**》（High Output Management: 安迪·格鲁夫所著的一本关于管理和生产力的书籍）。
Ben: 基本上，就是他们是否足够优秀，让你能从他们身上学习？
Ben: 就像阿里曾是一位优秀的工程主管，但实际上他之所以优秀，是因为在他手下工作的人都在做着了不起的事情，我只是站在他们的肩膀上。
Ben: 所以你必须这样做，并且必须递归地灌输给其他人也这样做，这样你最终会拥有一支令人惊叹的强大团队，而且你必须继续这样做。
Ben: 对于工程部门来说，这实际上并不难，因为我写了很多软件。
Ben: 但现在你是CEO，所以你必须为市场营销、为销售部门做同样的事情。
Ben: 他们（本和马克）非常乐于助人，因为他们曾在**LoudCloud**（LoudCloud: 本·霍洛维茨联合创办的一家互联网基础设施公司）和**Opsware**（Opsware: 一家软件公司，后被惠普收购，本·霍洛维茨曾任CEO）做过。
Ben: 所以他们知道如何构建一个**B2B**（企业对企业: 一种商业模式，指企业间进行产品、服务或信息交换）机器，知道这个游戏怎么玩。
Ben: 但你必须重新再做一遍，只是现在你是在一个你完全不了解的领域，而且你的所有直觉可能都是错的，你的判断也完全错误。
Ben: 那么，你能预见并看到真相，还是想欺骗自己？
Ben: 我认为很多创始人都在这里犯了错误。他们在自己的专业领域表现出色。
Ben: 当他们不得不走出自己的专业领域时，他们就会犯错。他们会为其他角色雇佣与自己相似的人，但这可能是致命的。

Host: By the way, that's how we started Databricks. I think everybody was a **PhD** (博士学位: 哲学博士，高等教育学位) in computer science who was running anything.

Host: 顺便说一句，Databricks就是这样开始的。我想当时负责任何事务的人，都是计算机科学**博士**（PhD: 哲学博士，高等教育学位）。

Ben: Yeah, including sales.

Ben: 是的，包括销售。

Ali: Yeah, that's probably the number one mistake is you just go, "Okay, well, like I'm an engineer, so I want a sales guy who can talk to me and understands engineering."
Ali: And that's like, well, that's not a really good criteria for sales.

Ali: 是的，那可能是最大的错误，你只是说：“好吧，我是一名工程师，所以我想要一个能和我交流并理解工程的销售人员。”
Ali: 而这，对于销售来说，并不是一个真正好的标准。

### 巧妙提问与有效反馈

Ben: One thing that I'm good at is rather than telling somebody, "You know, that's stupid and hurting their feelings or so forth," I'll ask them a really messed up question.
Ben: Actually, I did it in a board meeting. I said, "Well, could you help me with the math on this?" Because I don't understand the math.
Ben: Actually, it was worse. I said, "Help me with the, I'm just trying to understand basic math. You have all these numbers on the slide."
Ben: "And if you said that your conversion ratio is 5%, but I can't divide any of those two numbers to get 5%."
Ben: "And then the person freaked out and said, 'No, no, don't freak out. Just tell me which of the two numbers do I divide to get 5%?' Because I've divided all of them and none of them is 5%."

Ben: 我擅长的一件事是，我不会直接告诉别人“你知道，那很蠢，会伤害他们的感情等等”，我会问他们一个非常刁钻的问题。
Ben: 事实上，我在一次董事会议上就这么做了。我说：“那么，你能帮我算算这个数学问题吗？”因为我不懂这些数学。
Ben: 实际上，情况更糟。我说：“帮我算算，我只是想理解基本的数学。你的幻灯片上有很多数字。”
Ben: “如果你说你的转化率是5%。但我无法用那两个数字中的任何一个相除得到5%。”
Ben: “然后那个人吓坏了，我说：‘不，不，别慌。你告诉我，我应该用哪两个数字相除才能得到5%？’因为我把它们都除了一遍，没有一个结果是5%。”

Ali: Like, "Am I going to be fired?" So, he does a much better version of that, which is he'll, if somebody's really, really screwed something up or messing up, he'll go, "How do you think it's going?"
Ali: And I was like, since he told me that, I was like, "Oh, yeah, that's a better way to do it. That's even better."

Ali: 就像是，“我会被解雇吗？”所以，他做得更好，如果有人真的搞砸了什么或者出了问题，他会问：“你觉得进展如何？”
Ali: 我当时想，自从他告诉我这个方法后，我就觉得：“哦，是的，那是个更好的做法。那样甚至更好。”

Host: So, yeah. He's a very good student.

Host: 是啊。他是个非常好的学生。

Ali: Can I reframe that? I think there's this book called **Radical Candor** (彻底坦率: 金·斯科特所著的一本关于领导力反馈的畅销书), and I think people take it too far and they misunderstand it and so on.
Ali: But I think the essence of that book is that if feedback, if you know, are you criticizing me?

Ali: 我能重新定义一下吗？我认为有一本书叫《**彻底坦率**》（Radical Candor: 金·斯科特所著的一本关于领导力反馈的畅销书），我觉得人们有点把它过度解读和误解了。
Ali: 但我认为那本书的精髓是，如果反馈，如果你知道，你是在批评我吗？

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: Are you saying I'm stupid? I can't do the vision because my point is not about the 5%. I was trying to make a different point, and now you're just, this is a cheap shot, and now I'm hurt and I think, by the way, I think you're wrong. It's not 5%. I said 6.5%.
Ali: So, are you criticizing me or is it like, "No, no, I'm here to help you. I can, like, not help you, but if you beg me for help, maybe I'll help you."
Ali: So, which of the two modes? If you can get people into the mode of like, "Oh, wow. I'm being helped, like they're helping me and I'm going to get further ahead in my career and I'll be more successful."
Ali: "Please, no, no, no, please don't leave. Come back and tell me more. I'm taking notes here."
Ali: So, if you can flip to that, and I think a lot of feedback can be recast into, "I'm just here to help you, but feel free to completely ignore this advice. But if you want to be really successful, if you want to get that job or if you want to get that project next time, if you did it this way, you probably would have had a higher probability of getting that. But I don't care. You do whatever you want."
Ali: And then people are much more receptive. They're like, "No, no, no, please. I want to know more."

Ali: 你是说我笨吗？我无法完成这个愿景，因为我的重点不是那5%。我本来想表达一个不同的观点，而你现在只是，这是个卑鄙的攻击，我现在很受伤，而且我认为，顺便说一句，你错了。不是5%，我说的是6.5%。
Ali: 所以，你是在批评我，还是说：“不，不，我来这里是为了帮助你。我不会主动帮助你，但如果你求我帮忙，也许我会帮你。”
Ali: 那么，是这两种模式中的哪一种？如果你能让人们进入这样一种模式，就是：“哦，哇。我正在被帮助，他们正在帮助我，我的职业生涯会更进一步，我会更成功。”
Ali: “拜托，不，不，不，请不要离开。回来告诉我更多，我正在这里做笔记。”
Ali: 所以，如果你能转换到那种模式，我认为很多反馈都可以重新表述为：“我只是来帮助你的，但你可以完全忽略这个建议。但如果你想真正成功，如果你下次想得到那份工作或那个项目，如果你这样做，你成功的可能性可能会更高。但我不在乎。你想怎么做就怎么做。”
Ali: 然后人们会更乐于接受。他们会说：“不，不，不，请告诉我更多。”

### 反馈的频率与接受度

Ben: Well, and then just the frequency of it, I think, helps a lot too.
Ben: If I see you once a year at your review and I tell you what's wrong with you, you're going to be offended.
Ben: No matter what it is, no matter how wrong it is, no matter how correct I am, it's going to be offensive.
Ben: But if every day if I see you doing something I don't like, I go, "No, don't do it that way. Do it this way." Then you get desensitized to it.
Ben: And so I think the mistake a lot of particular engineers make is they just don't say what they think when they think it because they're afraid of hurting someone's feelings.
Ben: But that's how you save their feelings because they're used to you. You're always doing that and you're doing with everybody.
Ben: They see it. They're like, "Oh yeah, Ben's an asshole. He's always doing this, but that's how he is and that's how we work and it's no problem."
Ben: As opposed to, you know, the hammer and you try and put in a shit sandwich. "Oh, you do this really well, but this is all screwed up and this is good."
Ben: And people are like, "Well, so now in my written review, you're telling me that for the first time this is all screwed up. Screw you."

Ben: 嗯，我认为反馈的频率也有很大帮助。
Ben: 如果我一年只在你的绩效评估中见到你一次，然后告诉你你的缺点，你肯定会觉得被冒犯。
Ben: 无论是什么内容，无论它有多么错误，无论我多么正确，都会让人觉得不舒服。
- 但如果我每天都看到你做一些我不喜欢的事情，然后我说：“不，不要那样做。这样做。”那么你就会习惯了。
Ben: 所以我认为很多工程师犯的错误是，他们想到什么就不说什么，因为他们害怕伤害别人的感情。
Ben: 但这正是你保护他们感情的方式，因为他们习惯了你。你总是这样做，你对每个人都这样做。
Ben: 他们看到了。他们会说：“哦，本就是个混蛋。他总是这样，但这就是他的为人，我们就是这样工作的，没问题。”
Ben: 而不是，你知道，用大锤砸，然后试图塞进一个“粪便三明治”。“哦，你这方面做得很好，但这里全搞砸了，而这里又不错。”
Ben: 人们就会想：“好吧，所以现在在我的书面评估中，你第一次告诉我这一切都搞砸了。去你的。”

Ali: This is very common, and you can see this in the industry. People, the extreme version of it is like they get fired.
Ali: And then head of HR talks to them and they're like, "Do you see this coming? It was obvious, right? You knew this."
Ali: "No, I had no idea. Wait, you didn't get any feedback on this?" "No, I only got thumbs up all along for a whole year. So I'm in shock."
Ali: This is super common, right?

Ali: 这非常普遍，你在行业中可以看到这种情况。人们，最极端的情况是他们被解雇了。
Ali: 然后**人力资源**（HR: 人力资源部门）主管和他们谈话，问道：“你预料到会这样吗？这很明显，对吧？你心里有数。”
Ali: “不，我完全不知道。等等，你没有收到任何关于这方面的反馈吗？”“没有，我一整年都只收到赞扬。所以我很震惊。”
Ali: 这非常普遍，对吧？

### Databricks的高强度文化与人才管理

Host: So maybe on the topic of managing talent, you have this incredibly high-intensity culture at Databricks.
Host: And there was this thread recently in our CEO thread where they asked everyone, but you had a great response on, "Hey, we have 50 people. How do we scale? We have this culture of **996** (996: 一种工作制度，指早上9点上班，晚上9点下班，每周工作6天)."
Host: How have you scaled that intensity well into 10,000 employees?

Host: 那么，关于人才管理的话题，Databricks拥有一种难以置信的高强度文化。
Host: 最近在我们的CEO讨论群里，大家都在问这个问题，但你给出了一个很好的回答，就是“嘿，我们有50个人。我们如何扩展？我们有这种**996**（996: 一种工作制度，指早上9点上班，晚上9点下班，每周工作6天）文化。”
Host: 你是如何将这种强度成功扩展到一万名员工的？

Ali: I think, start with setting the tone at the top. If you're the hardest working person, everything will take care of itself from there on.
Ali: If you're not working hard, it's very hard. It's a double standard. Ben has a whole book about that, which is, "What you do is who you are" is the whole title of the book.
Ali: So if you are working extremely, extremely hard, the rest of the organization is also as well.
Ali: Are you calling people at 9:00 p.m., 10:00 p.m.? Are you working weekends?
Ali: Do they expect you, not that you expect them and you're going to be angry and yell at them if they're not dropping everything for you, not that.
Ali: But the fact that they just know that Ali is working 24/7 and he's working 7 days a week and he's working at 11:00 p.m. or 2:00 a.m. or whatever it is.
Ali: I think that gets a lot of it done. The second thing I would say is, you can vet for this when you hire people.
Ali: The easiest way to vet for it, because you got to be careful with it, because the people who say they're going to work the hardest are not the ones who work the hardest.

Ali: 我认为，首先要从高层定下基调。如果你是最努力工作的人，那么从那时起，一切都会迎刃而解。
Ali: 如果你不努力工作，那会很难。这是一个双重标准。本有一整本书都在讲这个，书名就是《你做什么，你就是谁》。
Ali: 所以，如果你非常非常努力地工作，组织的其他人也会如此。
Ali: 你会在晚上9点、10点打电话给别人吗？你会在周末工作吗？
Ali: 他们是否期待你这样做，而不是你期待他们这样做，并且如果他们不为你放下一切，你就会生气并对他们大吼大叫，不是那样。
Ali: 而是他们知道阿里每周7天、每天24小时都在工作，他会在晚上11点或凌晨2点工作，或者任何时候。
Ali: 我认为这能完成很多事情。第二点我想说的是，你可以在招聘人员时进行考察。
Ali: 最简单的考察方法，因为你必须小心，那些说自己会最努力工作的人，往往不是最努力工作的人。

Ben: It's the opposite.

Ben: 恰恰相反。

Ali: 100% true, right? So the best way to vet for this is to do backdoors.
Ali: Ask people, "If I ask someone, 'Hey, how was Sarah? Was she great?'" They're always going to say, "Yeah, she was great."
Ali: But they're going to be much more honest if you ask them, "Hey, how much does she grind the midnight oil? Is she like..."
Ali: And they'll tell you right away. It's like, "Oh my god, she works like crazy." Or, "She's, I mean, I think she has a good balance."
Ali: You can sus that out very easily from backdoor references.
Ali: People will remember the people and they'll just offer it up and say, "Oh, that person was like nuts. They were like working 24/7."
Ali: So I think that way you can get people that are hardworking.
Ali: By the way, I don't want to overemphasize. I don't think everything is just work harder. You have to also work smarter.
Ali: And I think that you want to make sure that it's sustainable. I can work insanely hard. I'm motivated.
Ali: Everybody has a different threshold for how hard they can work. I don't think you want a culture where people are burning out. I think you really should avoid that.
Ali: In fact, at Databricks, I'm very often going in and saying, "Hey, this team, your scores are really bad on **work-life balance** (工作与生活平衡: 指个人在职业和个人生活之间分配时间和精力的状态). What are you doing about it?"
Ali: Or, "You guys should take several days off, or you should do some offsites or do something."
Ali: We actually go in and if we see that there's some groups and other groups at Databricks, their work-life balance scores are like 100%. They're like slacking off.
Ali: So then it's kind of the opposite. But I do think that you can vet for that.
Ali: And I think that also setting the expectation. I would say one of my competitors, Frank Slutman, wrote a book called **Amp It Up** (Amp It Up: 一本关于如何提升公司执行力和绩效的书).
Ali: It's a great book on how you get execution into a company, like getting a high-performance culture where everybody's always trying to excel and do better and better.
Ali: Sort of that kind of culture into a company. That's a good book if you want to just study, and he's doing it at scale at bigger companies. So I think that's highly recommended reading as well.

Ali: 100%正确，对吧？所以，考察这方面的最好方法是进行背景调查。
Ali: 问别人：“如果我问一个人，‘嘿，莎拉怎么样？她很棒吗？’”他们总是会说：“是啊，她很棒。”
Ali: 但如果你问他们：“嘿，她是不是经常熬夜工作？她是不是那种……”他们会立刻告诉你。
Ali: 就像是：“哦，天哪，她工作起来像疯了一样。”或者，“她，我的意思是，我觉得她有一个很好的平衡。”
Ali: 你可以很容易地通过背景调查来发现这些。
Ali: 人们会记住那些人，他们会主动告诉你：“哦，那个人简直疯了。他们就像24/7都在工作。”
Ali: 所以我认为通过这种方式你可以找到勤奋的人。
Ali: 顺便说一句，我不想过分强调。我并不认为一切都只是更努力工作。你还必须更聪明地工作。
Ali: 我认为你需要确保它是可持续的。我可以疯狂地努力工作。我很有动力。
Ali: 每个人对他们能工作多努力都有不同的承受阈值。我认为你不想要一种让人们筋疲力尽的文化。我认为你真的应该避免那样。
Ali: 事实上，在Databricks，我经常会进去说：“嘿，这个团队，你们在**工作与生活平衡**（work-life balance: 指个人在职业和个人生活之间分配时间和精力的状态）方面的得分真的很差。你们打算怎么做？”
Ali: 或者，“你们应该休几天假，或者搞一些团建活动，或者做些什么。”
Ali: 我们确实会进去，如果我们看到Databricks的一些团队和其他团队，他们的工作与生活平衡得分是100%。他们就像在偷懒。
Ali: 所以情况就有点相反了。但我确实认为你可以对此进行考察。
Ali: 我认为还要设定期望。我想说，我的一个竞争对手，弗兰克·斯鲁特曼（Frank Slutman），写了一本书叫《**Amp It Up**》（Amp It Up: 一本关于如何提升公司执行力和绩效的书）。
Ali: 这是一本关于如何让公司实现执行力，比如建立一种高绩效文化，让每个人都不断努力超越自我，做得越来越好。
Ali: 将这种文化融入公司。如果你想学习，那是一本好书，他正在更大的公司大规模地实践它。所以我认为那也是强烈推荐的读物。

### 组织设计与员工影响力

Host: Yeah. And I think a lot of it at his scale ends up being things like **organizational design** (组织设计: 构建或重构公司结构以实现特定目标的过程).
Host: And are people feeling like they're having an impact? If people are feeling like they're having an impact and they're good, then they'll work very hard.
Host: But if you're in some kind of weird three-legged race that the CEO has constructed where everybody's got dependencies on everybody else, it just doesn't matter.
Host: You'll just have a lot of people go, "I know if I work hard, it's not going to make a difference. So why would I do that?"
Host: And you can't overcome that with "rah-rah" and "lead by example" or anything else. That's just fundamental to how it is.
Host: And you see in any company of any scale, even at our scale, there are some groups who really can have impact and work extremely hard.
Host: And then groups who have lesser impact will work less hard, and you just see that.

Host: 是的。我认为在他那种规模下，很多时候最终都归结为**组织设计**（organizational design: 构建或重构公司结构以实现特定目标的过程）之类的事情。
Host: 人们是否觉得自己有影响力？如果人们觉得自己有影响力并且表现出色，他们就会非常努力地工作。
Host: 但如果你在一个CEO构建的某种奇怪的三人赛跑中，每个人都依赖于其他人，那根本就无关紧要。
Host: 很多人会想：“我知道即使我努力工作，也无济于事。那我为什么要这样做？”
Host: 而你无法通过“加油打气”和“以身作则”或任何其他方式来克服这一点。这只是事情的根本。
Host: 你可以在任何规模的公司中看到这一点，即使在我们这样的规模，有些团队确实能产生影响并极其努力地工作。
Host: 而那些影响力较小的团队则会工作得不那么努力，你就会看到这种现象。

Ali: People who are motivated and they feel excited about work, and they don't see the impact that they're having, they're going to work way, way, way harder.
Ali: Versus if you're demoralized and you feel like it's not going well, I'm not having impact, I don't have any autonomy.
Ali: Then you're not going to, you just don't want to work. Even you're kind of depressed sitting down working.
Ali: I do think there's one thing here where leaders can really help, which is to make your team feel like they're winning and that they're doing a great job.
Ali: You can ask more from people, but if I feel like, "Hey, I'm losing and everything we're doing is wrong."
Ali: "And I'm putting in all these hours and it's stupid," what's the point of this? Then people don't want to work.
Ali: So I think it's like feeling like we're winning, like we're the winning team. We're winning.
Ali: And, "Wow, they're expecting more from me." Then I think you can get, you need that motivation in people.

Ali: 那些有动力、对工作感到兴奋，但却看不到自己产生影响的人，他们会工作得更努力。
Ali: 相反，如果你士气低落，觉得进展不顺，没有影响力，也没有任何自主权。
Ali: 那么你就不想工作了。甚至你会沮丧地坐着工作。
Ali: 我确实认为领导者可以在这方面提供帮助，那就是让你的团队觉得他们正在赢，并且他们做得很好。
Ali: 你可以要求人们付出更多，但如果我觉得：“嘿，我正在输，我们做的一切都是错的。”
Ali: “而且我付出了所有这些时间，这很愚蠢，”那有什么意义呢？那么人们就不想工作了。
Ali: 所以我认为，这就像是感觉我们在赢，我们是胜利的团队。我们正在赢。
Ali: 而且，“哇，他们对我期望更高。”那么我认为你可以获得，你需要人们拥有那种动力。

Ben: Which is why the hard job is when you aren't winning.

Ben: 这就是为什么当你不赢的时候，工作会很艰难。

Host: To get the output, particularly in **Silicon Valley** (硅谷: 位于美国加利福尼亚州北部，是全球高科技产业的中心).
Host: Because you're battling **attrition** (人员流失: 员工离开公司，通常指自然减员而非裁员), this and that, and to get things on the right track, that takes a whole different kind of level of technique and storytelling and show you how you could be winning and all that kind of stuff that gets very, very complicated.

Host: 要想取得成果，尤其是在**硅谷**（Silicon Valley: 位于美国加利福尼亚州北部，是全球高科技产业的中心）。
Host: 因为你正在与**人员流失**（attrition: 员工离开公司，通常指自然减员而非裁员）等各种问题作斗争，要想让事情步入正轨，那需要一种完全不同层面的技术和讲故事的能力，以及向你展示如何才能获胜，所有这些都变得非常非常复杂。

Ali: We've both done that, right?

Ali: 我们都经历过，对吧？

Ben: There's been phases in our company's lives where we weren't winning.

Ben: 在我们公司的发展历程中，有过一些阶段我们并没有取得胜利。

Ali: I mean, especially, the story you had in **The Hard Thing About Hard Things** (《创业维艰》: 本·霍洛维茨所著的一本关于创业和管理挑战的书), which is probably the best business book I've read, which I read, by the way, before starting Databricks and influenced us a lot.
Ali: Those are super important. That's the difficult, that's such an important point, because even if you're winning, people got to feel like that.
Ali: But if you're not winning, getting them to feel like you're winning is, "We have a path to winning."

Ali: 我的意思是，特别是你在《**创业维艰**》（The Hard Thing About Hard Things: 本·霍洛维茨所著的一本关于创业和管理挑战的书）中讲的故事，那可能是我读过的最好的商业书，顺便说一句，我在创办Databricks之前读过它，它对我们影响很大。
Ali: 这些都非常重要。那是一个困难，也是一个如此重要的点，因为即使你正在赢，人们也必须有那种感觉。
Ali: 但如果你没有赢，要让他们觉得你正在赢，就是“我们有一条通向胜利的道路”。

Ben: Yeah, we have a path.

Ben: 是的，我们有一条路。

Ali: We have a, and it's like rock solid. It's going to work, but it demands sacrifice from all of us.
Ali: And there is no feeling as good as when you're not winning and then you get it to winning.
Ali: That's the best feeling. You can't replicate that once you're super successful. You never can quite get that feeling again.

Ali: 我们有一个，而且它坚如磐石。它会奏效，但这需要我们所有人做出牺牲。
Ali: 没有什么感觉比当你没有赢，然后你把它带到胜利的感觉更好了。
Ali: 那是最好的感觉。一旦你非常成功，你就无法复制那种感觉了。你再也无法完全获得那种感觉。

Ben: Yeah, that's true.

Ben: 是的，没错。

Ali: But you also never feel that horrible pain again.

Ali: 但你也不会再感受到那种可怕的痛苦了。

Ben: Well, it's easier to be the underdog in some ways, right? You have nothing to lose.

Ben: 嗯，在某些方面，作为弱者更容易，对吧？你没有什么可失去的。

Ali: In some ways, in most ways not.

Ali: 在某些方面是这样，但在大多数方面并非如此。

### 领导风格：高瞻远瞩与深入细节

Host: I want to explore this leading from the top because that was kind of the first thing you started with.
Host: We actually hired an ex-Databricks employee to A16Z. So we have some inside scoop on your leadership style.
Host: And one of the things he said was, you have this, and Ben sort of touched on this too, but you have this amazing ability to be strategic, help your team focus, but you're also very in the weeds.
Host: You're giving product feedback, you respond to emails super quickly, and product launch emails, no matter how small they are, you'll respond "congrats," which he found hugely motivating.
Host: How do you do all that? Where do you fly high, where do you fly low?

Host: 我想探讨一下这种从高层领导的方式，因为那是你最初开始的话题。
Host: 我们实际上雇佣了一位前Databricks员工到A16Z。所以我们对你的领导风格有一些内部消息。
Host: 他说，你拥有这种惊人的能力，本也提到了这一点，你能够制定战略，帮助团队聚焦，但你也能深入细节。
Host: 你会提供产品反馈，回复邮件非常快，而且产品发布邮件，无论多么微小，你都会回复“恭喜”，他觉得这极大地鼓舞了士气。
Host: 你是如何做到这一切的？你何时高瞻远瞩，何时又深入细节？

Ali: By the way, I respond even to progress reports on all those products, and I follow them in detail, every one of them. I try to respond to every product.

Ali: 顺便说一下，我甚至会回复所有这些产品的进度报告，并且详细跟踪每一个产品。我努力回复每一个产品。

Host: Insane.

Host: 太疯狂了。

Ali: Look, I think this is, if you're just going to fly high and give high-level inspirational speeches and then we'll trust and we'll delegate to people, it's not going to work.
Ali: So my way is, you got to get in the weeds. You got to understand, this is back to what I said at the very beginning, how do you become great at head of engineering?
Ali: How do you hire a great head of marketing? The only way you can do that is by being really excellent at it.
Ali: So you need to study the game and become the best. So I try to stay tuned to all of these things.

Ali: 听着，我认为如果你只是高高在上，发表鼓舞人心的演讲，然后说我们会信任并授权给员工，那是行不通的。
Ali: 所以我的方式是，你必须深入细节。你必须理解，这又回到了我一开始说的，你如何成为一名优秀的工程主管？
Ali: 你如何雇佣一名优秀的市场主管？唯一的方法就是你在这方面做得非常出色。
Ali: 所以你需要研究这个游戏，并成为最棒的。所以我努力关注所有这些事情。

Ben: There's this quote, "If you do everything, you will win." And then the question is, "Have you done everything?"

Ben: 有句话说：“如果你做了一切，你就会赢。”那么问题是：“你做了一切吗？”

Ali: Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So, you just, it takes a lot of effort.
Ali: You need to learn all your keyboard shortcuts. But I think that's, people feel motivated that, "Hey, I have a direct relationship."
Ali: We used to say, we used to have one of the culture principles, "Be a co-founder."
Ali: And we don't want to have any employees at Databricks, we just want co-founders.
Ali: So the key point was like, "Hey, you're kind of the owner of this company. You're not just a renter."
Ali: "Come here and, yeah, we can talk about it, and you can suggest an idea. You might have just joined and you're straight out of school. You might have a great idea for a product. Tell me about it."
Ali: "I'm happy to push it." And so, it's making people feel like they have an impact and they're inspired.
Ali: Back to Ben's point, then it's going to be much more exciting for them than following some bureaucracy.
Ali: So I don't follow the bureaucracy basically. I go talk to anyone I like.
Ali: I try to go to the person that is actually the closest to the work that's being done at any given time.

Ali: 完全正确。就是这样。所以，这需要大量的努力。
Ali: 你需要学习所有的键盘快捷键。但我认为，人们会因此感到有动力，觉得“嘿，我有一个直接的关系。”
Ali: 我们过去常说，我们有一个文化原则：“做一名联合创始人。”
Ali: 我们不希望Databricks有任何员工，我们只想要联合创始人。
Ali: 所以关键点是：“嘿，你有点像这家公司的老板。你不仅仅是一个租客。”
Ali: “来这里，是的，我们可以谈谈，你可以提出一个想法。你可能刚加入，刚毕业。你可能对一个产品有一个很棒的想法。告诉我吧。”
Ali: “我很乐意推动它。”所以，这让人们觉得他们有影响力，并且受到启发。
Ali: 回到本的观点，那对他们来说会比遵循一些官僚主义更加令人兴奋。
Ali: 所以我基本上不遵循官僚主义。我喜欢和任何人交谈。
Ali: 我努力去找那些实际上最接近当前正在进行工作的人。

### 深入基层，获取真相

Ali: But there are some tricks and rules around how you do that without breaking the whole organization. So you can't just willingly talk to anyone.
Ali: But yeah, that's part of it.

Ali: 但也有一些技巧和规则，教你如何在不破坏整个组织的情况下做到这一点。所以你不能随意和任何人交谈。
Ali: 但，是的，那是其中一部分。

Ben: You listening and giving direction is very different. If you give direction, you can cause a lot of chaos.
Ben: But if you go talk to people, you listen to understand the problem, and then send it back down the chain of command, it tends to work very, very well.
Ben: But generally, if you're a CEO and you don't fly low and fast, it's going to be a mess.
Ben: Because you never get the truth. Because the truth never makes it to you through your people.
Ben: If I go talk to Ali's executive staff about what's going on in their organization or anybody's, first of all, they're going to spin it.
Ben: Second of all, they don't actually know.
Ben: And so you need to help them debug their organizations because they've got a million things going on.
Ben: They're also kind of going to the problem, going to the bottleneck, trying to figure out what's happening.
Ben: And so that it's just a very unreliable source of information.
Ben: All the knowledge in a company is with the individual contributors that are doing the work and the customers.
Ben: There's no knowledge with the people who are talking to you as CEO, who are on your staff. That's not the way information moves.
Ben: And so you got to be, now he's super fast, which enables him to go super low.
Ben: But in any given time, the way to think about it as a CEO is it's not like you're spending the exact amount of attention to HR as you are to the key engineering project, as you are to the key sales competitive deals.
Ben: You don't address everything evenly. You can never do that. It's just a bad idea.
Ben: Now, you'll probably get to everything eventually, but you're not spending the same amount of time on every single department.
Ben: The ORC chart is not the way that company works. It's just a communication architecture.

Ben: 你倾听和给出指示是非常不同的。如果你给出指示，可能会造成很多混乱。
Ben: 但如果你去和人们交谈，倾听以理解问题，然后将其反馈给指挥链，这种方式往往会非常有效。
Ben: 但总的来说，如果你是一名CEO，却不深入基层快速行动，那就会一团糟。
Ben: 因为你永远得不到真相。因为真相永远不会通过你的人传达给你。
Ben: 如果我去和阿里的高管团队谈论他们组织中发生的事情，或者任何人的组织，首先，他们会扭曲事实。
Ben: 其次，他们实际上并不知道。
Ben: 所以你需要帮助他们调试他们的组织，因为他们有上百万件事情在忙。
Ben: 他们也在寻找问题，寻找瓶颈，试图弄清楚发生了什么。
Ben: 所以那只是一个非常不可靠的信息来源。
Ben: 公司里所有的知识都掌握在那些正在工作的个体贡献者和客户手中。
Ben: 那些作为CEO向你汇报的员工，那些在你团队中的人，他们那里没有知识。信息不是那样流动的。
Ben: 所以你必须，现在他速度超快，这使他能够深入到非常低的层面。
Ben: 但在任何特定时间，作为CEO的思考方式是，你不会对人力资源、关键工程项目、关键销售竞争交易投入完全相同的关注度。
Ben: 你不会平均地处理所有事情。你永远做不到。那只是个糟糕的主意。
Ben: 现在，你最终可能会处理所有事情，但你不会在每个部门上花费相同的时间。
Ben: 组织架构图不是公司运作的方式。它只是一种沟通架构。

### 领导力的T型结构：广度与深度

Ali: I think the best way I would say it is like it's kind of like a T.
Ali: You want to be broad, and then you have the leg that goes down and goes really, really deep. But you want to do that anchoring.
Ali: And the key thing is to have a really good priority order of what's most important and kind of drop everything else.
Ali: You drop that T and go really, really low. It might be HR. I might be deep diving all the way down to HR, looking at our HR handbook, our policy, everything.
Ali: Like, "Who was this person? What happened? Why is this happening in that group? What's going on in that group? What's the culture in that group? What happened here?"
Ali: You might want to do that. It might be existential for your company, as we've seen some companies went under because of HR problems or ethical issues that were going on.
Ali: So I think having a really good priority order is really important.
Ali: I think some execs, they just want to have perfect ducks in a row. "I have my weekly one-on-ones, I have my weekly staff meeting, I have my weekly this, and then I do this, and then we follow the rules and we do all of this."
Ali: And then that's just like the top part of the T. And then there's nothing that goes deep, and that's the issue, I think.

Ali: 我认为最好的说法是它有点像一个“T”字形。
Ali: 你希望广度足够，然后有一条腿可以深入到非常非常深的地方。但你希望做到这种锚定。
Ali: 关键是要有一个非常好的优先次序，知道什么是最重要的，然后放弃其他一切。
Ali: 你放弃那个“T”的顶部，深入到非常非常低的层面。它可能是人力资源。我可能会深入到人力资源的方方面面，查看我们的人力资源手册、政策、所有一切。
Ali: 比如，“这个人是谁？发生了什么？为什么这个团队会发生这种事？那个团队发生了什么？那个团队的文化是什么？这里发生了什么？”
Ali: 你可能想这样做。这可能对你的公司来说是生死攸关的，因为我们看到一些公司因为人力资源问题或正在发生的道德问题而倒闭。
Ali: 所以我认为有一个非常好的优先次序非常重要。
Ali: 我认为一些高管，他们只是想把所有事情都安排得井井有条。“我有每周一对一，我有每周员工会议，我有每周这个，然后我做这个，然后我们遵循规则，做所有这些。”
Ali: 然后那就像是“T”的顶部。然后就没有深入的东西了，我认为这就是问题所在。

Ben: Yeah. Over-systematizing or making it symmetrical. You don't have to have one-on-ones with the same frequency of all your staff.
Ben: Some of them, you know, you can meet very seldom. Everything is different. Every part of the company is different.
Ben: You may need to meet with somebody every day.

Ben: 是的。过度系统化或使其对称。你不必以相同的频率与所有员工进行一对一会谈。
Ben: 有些人，你知道，你可以很少见面。一切都是不同的。公司的每个部分都不同。
Ben: 你可能需要每天与某人会面。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: And then other people, you can meet once a quarter for now because it's just not that serious.
Ben: And you can't get caught up in making everything fair and symmetric. Particularly like your staff, they got to be able to deal.

Ben: 然后，其他人，你现在可以每季度见一次面，因为它没那么重要。
Ben: 你不能陷入让一切公平和对称的困境。特别是你的员工，他们必须能够应对。

Ali: Yeah. And this is actually the biggest conversation that I had with Ali early on. If they can't do it, they can't do it. That's it.

Ali: 是的。这实际上是我早期和阿里进行的最大一次对话。如果他们做不到，那就是做不到。就这样。

Ben: It's a wrap. Don't try and fix them. They can't be fixed. It's not going to happen.

Ben: 结束了。别想去修补他们。他们修补不了。那不会发生的。

Ali: And you know, it's a sad lesson, but important lesson.

Ali: 你知道，这是一个悲伤的教训，但也是一个重要的教训。

### 微软合作：从BD新手到交易大师

Host: I want to turn the conversation to an area that Ben was saying you had to catch up on, at least in the beginning, which is the BD deal-making stuff, which is interesting to me just because I think of you as a consummate dealmaker now.
Host: I feel like you're playing chess, everyone else is playing checkers.
Host: I want to go back to 2017 with maybe one of the first game-changing deals that you guys did, and that was the deal with Microsoft.
Host: Can you guys talk a little bit more about how that deal came about? Anything you do differently?
Host: And by the way, founders still to this day ask us about it because it's a model for how they'd like to do deals.

Host: 我想把话题转向本曾说你至少在初期需要迎头赶上的一个领域，那就是**业务发展**（BD: 建立战略伙伴关系和关系的活动）交易达成方面，这对我来说很有趣，因为我现在觉得你是个完美的交易促成者。
Host: 我感觉你在下棋，而其他人都在玩跳棋。
Host: 我想回到2017年，谈谈你们做的第一个改变游戏规则的交易之一，那就是与微软的合作。
Host: 你们能多谈谈那笔交易是如何达成的吗？有没有什么不同的做法？
Host: 顺便说一句，直到今天，创始人仍然向我们询问那笔交易，因为它成为了他们希望达成交易的典范。

Ali: Maybe I should start by saying that we had tried to get close to Microsoft for a long while.
Ali: I think Ben had told us, "You need to, that's an important partner, because they have the biggest distribution channel."
Ali: "They today have 60,000 sellers. If you can unlock that in any small way, it's going to be a game changer for you."
Ali: And I had been CEO for a year. So I'd been trying hard to get in there.
Ali: And many, many people offered me, "Hey, I actually know **Satya** (萨提亚·纳德拉: 微软现任首席执行官), so I'm going to get you introduced."
Ali: And I got multiple introductions to Satya. He either never responded or just CCed his EA, and it went into EA, like, "We're still trying to find time. He's been so busy this last six months."
Ali: But then he had a meeting with Ben, and I think he was here actually at A16Z.
Ali: And they actually just talked, and I was not actually in the loop.
Ali: And then he called me up and said, "Hey, I talked to Satya, and I think he's excited. He wants to do this."

Ali: 也许我应该先说，我们很长一段时间以来都试图与微软建立密切关系。
Ali: 我记得本告诉我们：“你需要这样做，那是一个重要的合作伙伴，因为他们拥有最大的分销渠道。”
Ali: “他们今天有6万名销售人员。如果你能以任何微小的方式解锁这一点，那将对你来说是改变游戏规则的。”
Ali: 我当时已经担任CEO一年了。所以我一直努力想进入那里。
Ali: 很多人都告诉我：“嘿，我认识**萨提亚**（Satya Nadella: 微软现任首席执行官），所以我帮你引荐。”
Ali: 我多次被介绍给萨提亚。他要么从未回复，要么只是抄送给他的行政助理（EA），然后就进了行政助理的邮箱，像是：“我们还在努力找时间。他过去六个月一直很忙。”
Ali: 但后来他与本见了面，我想他当时实际上就在A16Z。
Ali: 他们俩只是聊了聊，我当时并不知情。
Ali: 然后他给我打电话说：“嘿，我跟萨提亚聊过了，我想他很兴奋。他想做这件事。”

Ben: I saved the email. Ben introduced me to Satya, and this was, I think, 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. I was in New York.
Ben: And the email went to Satya, and then Satya added four or five people to the email thread, and then they added four or five people.
Ben: So within an hour, I had 25 emails in my inbox.
Ben: And suddenly all these people that were not responding to my emails from Microsoft, right after Satya CCed the next person, they were all like, "Hey, I'm clearing my calendar. Would love to meet you. Do you have any time in the next two days or three days?"
Ben: But really kind of the original pitch of what's the give and get was Ben and Satya at A16Z, and they kind of figured it out, and I was not actually even there.
Ben: So we had some luck.

Ben: 我保存了那封邮件。本把我介绍给了萨提亚，当时我想是凌晨三四点，我在纽约。
Ben: 邮件发给了萨提亚，然后萨提亚又把四五个人加进了邮件线程，然后他们又加了四五个人。
Ben: 所以不到一个小时，我的收件箱里就有25封邮件。
Ben: 突然之间，所有那些之前不回复我邮件的微软员工，在萨提亚抄送了下一个人之后，他们都变得很积极，说：“嘿，我正在清理我的日程。很想见你。你未来两三天有空吗？”
Ben: 但实际上，最初关于“给予和获得”的提议是本和萨提亚在A16Z达成的，他们基本上搞定了，我当时甚至都不在场。
Ben: 所以我们有一些运气。

### 微软交易的策略与挑战

Ali: Ali did a couple of things that were, or quite a few things that were very, very effective.
Ali: So the luck was, at the time, dealing with big companies, there's always a timing element.
Ali: And there was a company called **Hortonworks** (Hortonworks: 一家大数据软件公司), that had a deal with Microsoft to provide some similar kind of functionality.
Ali: And they were basically putting a gun to Microsoft's head, saying like, "You pay us more money, or we're going to pull our product."
Ali: And they were on-prem, and they were in cloud, so it was a big mismatch also.

Ali: 阿里做了几件事，或者说很多事，都非常有效。
Ali: 所以运气在于，当时与大公司打交道，总是有时间因素。
Ali: 有一家名为**Hortonworks**（Hortonworks: 一家大数据软件公司）的公司，曾与微软达成协议，提供一些类似的功能。
Ali: 他们基本上是在威胁微软，说：“你要么给我们更多钱，要么我们就撤回产品。”
Ali: 而且他们是**本地部署**（on-prem: 软件安装在用户自己的服务器上）的，而他们又在云端，所以这也造成了很大的不匹配。

Ben: So Microsoft was super pissed at them and wanted to stick it to them.
Ben: And so that was, you know, so you have Satya going like, "I think this company's interesting."
Ben: And then this ground-level thing going like, "We want to screw these guys." And that kind of opened enough of a door to get it going.
Ben: But one of the most important things in the deal was, which John O'Farrell really emphasized this for both of us, was, "Look, you got to get them to put enough, they're such a big company that they're going to lose interest many times."
Ben: "So if you don't have them write you such a big check that somebody in there is going to get fired if it doesn't go well, you're, it doesn't matter if you get the deal, you're going to lose the deal."
Ben: And so what we did is we're like, and the technique that we had was, "Okay, give us a forecast. We're a little company. We can't afford to do this deal."
Ben: "We can only afford to have one partner. So give us a forecast of what you'll do."

Ben: 所以微软对他们非常恼火，想给他们点颜色看看。
Ben: 所以，萨提亚当时的想法是：“我觉得这家公司很有趣。”
Ben: 然后基层的人则想：“我们要搞垮这些家伙。”这为我们打开了足够的门，让事情得以进行。
Ben: 但这笔交易中最重要的事之一，约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）对我们俩都强调了这一点，那就是：“听着，你必须让他们投入足够的资金，他们是如此大的一家公司，他们会多次失去兴趣。”
Ben: “所以，如果你不让他们开出一张大额支票，大到如果事情进展不顺利，他们内部有人会被解雇的话，那么即使你达成了协议，最终你也会失去这笔交易。”
Ben: 所以我们采取的策略是：“好吧，给我们一个预测。我们是小公司。我们负担不起这笔交易。”
Ben: “我们只能有一个合作伙伴。所以，给我们一个你们能做什么的预测。”

Ali: Because our engineers are busy. They're going to do this integration that wipes out 12 months of our roadmap. We don't have anything else.
Ali: You guys have many thousands of engineers. So this is we only have one of these we can.

Ali: 因为我们的工程师很忙。他们将进行这项集成，这将耗尽我们12个月的路线图。我们没有其他东西了。
Ali: 你们有成千上万的工程师。所以我们只有这一个选择。

Ben: So, we, whoever can sell the, we think you can sell the most, but we don't know, what's your?
Ben: So kind of challenged their manhood a little bit. And so they come out with this big ass forecast, and we're like, "Okay, great, just give us a little portion of that."

Ben: 所以，我们，谁能卖得，我们认为你们能卖得最多，但我们不知道，你们的…？
Ben: 所以有点挑战了他们的男子气概。然后他们就拿出了这个巨大的预测，我们说：“好的，太棒了，只要给我们其中一小部分就行。”

Ali: It was a huge deal. It was a lot of it.

Ali: 那是一笔大买卖。很多。

Ben: And then Ali said, "Look, when we got all the way down to the deal, he was like, 'If I don't get this number, Ben's going to fire me.'"
Ben: "And so, can you help me out?" It was very interesting. Bad cop.

Ben: 然后阿里说：“听着，当我们谈到交易的最后阶段时，他说：‘如果我拿不到这个数字，本会解雇我。’”
Ben: “所以，你能帮我一下吗？”这很有趣。他扮演了坏警察。

### 交易中的“给予和获得”

Ali: It was a very interesting dynamic. John O'Farrell had strategized with us and told us that they have to do a big pre-commit because then they have **skin in the game** (投入风险: 指个人或组织在某个项目中投入了实际利益，从而对结果有直接影响).
Ali: Otherwise they're just going to forget. They'll do the PR, but then they'll forget about you.
Ali: But then when we were trying to get that from Microsoft, I remember I was talking to Takeshi Moto, who is one of the main brains at Microsoft, like one of the key strategists there.
Ali: And his thing was, "I don't want to give you a big commit because you're such a small company. I'm worried you take this money and you get drunk off of it and you're not going to do anything afterwards."
Ali: And so I had to really convince him that, "No, I'm extremely hungry. There's no way I will continue to have crazy appetites. Don't worry about it."
Ali: So both sides were kind of worried about different things.
Ali: But the give and get was important that you said in the beginning, which was they had a gap in the product portfolio, right?
Ali: They were competing with AWS. They had a gap at the time, and we had a great product. They have amazing distribution channel.
Ali: So in these BD deals, there always has to be a give and get that actually is kind of commensurate.
Ali: And this is why most of these deals fall apart and they don't work.
Ali: There has to be something that you as a small player can give that they don't have. And usually you don't have anything to give them.
Ali: Usually I find all these small companies show up and they come for instance to Databricks now and say, "Oh, we'd love for you to partner with us."
Ali: "But what am I getting out of it, right? You don't report to me, I don't report to you."
Ali: "So the moment we've closed the deal, if it's not good for me, neither of us will just do our side of the bargain."
Ali: So there has to be something in the deal dynamics, in the construct that inherently is extremely beneficial both sides. There has to be a trade that makes sense.
Ali: Microsoft really wanted that product. We really wanted their distribution channel.

Ali: 那是一种非常有趣的动态。约翰·奥法雷尔（John O'Farrell）曾与我们一起制定策略，并告诉我们，他们必须做出一个大的预先承诺，因为这样他们才有**投入风险**（skin in the game: 指个人或组织在某个项目中投入了实际利益，从而对结果有直接影响）。
Ali: 否则他们就会忘记。他们会做公关，但之后就会把你忘掉。
Ali: 但当我们试图从微软那里获得这个承诺时，我记得我正在和武本（Takeshi Moto）谈话，他是微软的主要智囊之一，就像那里的关键战略家之一。
Ali: 他的意思是：“我不想给你一个大的承诺，因为你是一家这么小的公司。我担心你拿到这笔钱后会得意忘形，之后什么都不做。”
Ali: 所以我必须真的说服他：“不，我非常渴望成功。我不可能停止这种疯狂的渴望。别担心。”
Ali: 所以双方都对不同的事情感到担忧。
Ali: 但你一开始说的“给予和获得”很重要，那就是他们的产品组合存在空白，对吧？
Ali: 他们当时正在与AWS竞争。他们当时有一个空白，而我们有一个很棒的产品。他们有惊人的分销渠道。
Ali: 所以在这些业务发展交易中，总是必须有一个实际相称的“给予和获得”。
Ali: 这就是为什么大多数这些交易都会失败，无法奏效。
Ali: 必须有一些东西是你这个小公司能够提供而他们没有的。而通常你没有什么可以给他们的。
Ali: 通常我发现所有这些小公司都会出现，比如现在来找Databricks说：“哦，我们很乐意与您合作。”
Ali: “但对我有什么好处呢，对吧？你不向我汇报，我也不向你汇报。”
Ali: “所以一旦我们达成交易，如果对我没有好处，我们双方都不会履行各自的承诺。”
Ali: 所以交易动态中，在结构上，必须有一些本质上对双方都极其有利的东西。必须有一个合理的交换。
Ali: 微软真的想要那个产品。我们真的想要他们的分销渠道。

### 永不放弃：交易过程中的挫折与坚持

Ali: And then the other thing that I think a lot of entrepreneurs don't understand is any big deal of that size, you lose at least three times before you win it.
Ali: And we lost that deal 10 times.

Ali: 然后，我认为很多创业者不明白的另一件事是，任何如此规模的大交易，你至少会输三次才能赢一次。
Ali: 而我们那笔交易输了10次。

Ben: 10 times. Including the day before we were supposed to launch it.
Ben: The antibodies came out of the company, and Ali had to fly up to **Redmond** (雷德蒙: 微软公司总部所在地) and sit there.
Ben: There was one engineer that just said, "Not doing this. This is not going to go. We don't."
Ben: He was, they actually put a guy in place at Microsoft who was actually super, you had a great reputation, but he was a builder.
Ben: So he just had huge problems with this. It's like, "This is not a product I built. Why would we, why would I make this successful?"
Ben: So usually there's many times. So if you don't have grit, those deals will die because this deal died multiple times as Ben said.
Ben: It was completely over, it was completely blocked by some exec that said, "Absolutely not. I'm blocking it. It's veto. It's over."
Ben: And no one wanted to overrule him. So you have to go in there and work.
Ben: And the only way we did, they call it the nerd bird. I would take the SF Seattle flight up there.
Ben: I was up there so much. I knew all the buildings, all the rooms, everything.
Ben: So you just have to spend time on the ground and talk to as many people as possible and sort of influence that organization from within.

Ben: 10次。包括我们原定发布的前一天。
Ben: 公司内部的“抗体”出现了，阿里不得不飞到**雷德蒙**（Redmond: 微软公司总部所在地），坐在那里。
Ben: 有一位工程师直接说：“不做这个。这行不通。我们不。”
Ben: 他是，他们实际上在微软安排了一个人，这个人声誉非常好，但他是一个建造者。
Ben: 所以他对这个有很大的问题。他就像：“这不是我建造的产品。我们为什么，我为什么要让它成功？”
Ben: 所以通常有很多次。所以如果你没有毅力，那些交易就会夭折，因为这笔交易就像本说的那样，死了好几次。
Ben: 它完全结束了，被某个高管完全阻止了，他说：“绝对不行。我阻止它。这是否决。结束了。”
Ben: 没有人愿意推翻他。所以你必须进去工作。
Ben: 我们唯一的方法，他们称之为“书呆子之鸟”。我会搭乘旧金山到西雅图的航班去那里。
Ben: 我在那里待了太多时间。我认识所有的建筑，所有的房间，所有的一切。
Ben: 所以你必须花时间在基层，与尽可能多的人交谈，并从内部影响那个组织。

### 微软的变革与成长型思维

Ali: And I will say, with all the difficulty of the deal, and Microsoft being Microsoft, they've been as good a partner as not only we've had at Databricks, but in the entire portfolio.
Ali: They've really lived up and delivered what they said they would do, which is, I think you have to give such a huge credit.
Ali: Because in the whole Gates and Ballmer era, they were never that good a partner to anybody, and he's really turned that around.
Ali: And they've been fantastic with us. This was around the time where Satya had taken over, and he was giving to everyone at Microsoft the book **Growth Mindset** (成长型思维: 一种相信个人能力和智力可以通过努力和学习不断发展的信念) or Mindset, which is about Growth Mindset.
Ali: So there was this kind of aura in the air that, "We should, we should try. Let's try to make things happen. Let's have a Growth Mindset here. Let's see is there a way we can partner."
Ali: So this would have been impossible five years earlier. So kudos to Satya, and they put us on the map, and he's been a great partner ever since.
Ali: Whenever there's been issues, they always resolve it. So we are very thankful. We wouldn't be where we are without them.

Ali: 我会说，尽管这笔交易困难重重，而且微软就是微软，但他们一直是我们Databricks，乃至整个投资组合中最好的合作伙伴。
Ali: 他们真正兑现并交付了他们所说的，我认为你必须给予他们极大的赞扬。
Ali: 因为在整个盖茨和鲍尔默时代，他们从未对任何人如此好的合作伙伴，而他（萨提亚）真的扭转了局面。
Ali: 他们对我们非常棒。这大约是萨提亚接任的时候，他当时正在给微软的每个人推荐《**成长型思维**》（Growth Mindset: 一种相信个人能力和智力可以通过努力和学习不断发展的信念）这本书。
Ali: 所以当时空气中弥漫着一种氛围，就是“我们应该，我们应该尝试。让我们努力促成事情。让我们在这里拥有成长型思维。让我们看看有没有合作的方式。”
Ali: 所以这在五年前是不可能实现的。所以要赞扬萨提亚，他们让我们声名鹊起，从那以后他一直是一个很好的合作伙伴。
Ali: 每当出现问题，他们总是会解决。所以我们非常感激。没有他们，我们不会有今天的成就。

### 收购策略：以人为本，整合产品

Host: I want to open up the conversation to deals more broadly now that you're not a small company anymore, and you're a big company making acquisitions, Tabular, Neon, Mosaic, just to name a few.
Host: What is your approach in terms of when to build versus when to buy slash how do you think about acquisitions more broadly?

Host: 我想把话题更广泛地转向交易，现在你们不再是小公司了，而是一家进行收购的大公司，比如Tabular、Neon、Mosaic，仅举几例。
Host: 你们在何时自建、何时收购方面有什么方法？或者说，你们如何更广泛地看待收购？

Ali: What we try to not do, so let's start with a simple thing, is a lot of companies, especially at scale, they'll buy revenue.
Ali: So they'll look at a company, they say, "Hey, this company is this size. We'll just buy that company. We'll put more sales people on it. Then we can accelerate the revenue. We're buying that revenue."
Ali: We're not doing that. What we're really doing is, number one, we spend a lot of time with the team and the founders.
Ali: So we're trying to see, "Hey, can we build together? Like, you come here and you build together."
Ali: That's very different from that buying revenue model. The buying revenue model often times you part ways from the CEO from day one.
Ali: You can see the big companies, they literally have a plan. I have some execs that come from these big companies, they say, "Hey, our plan usually is to part ways with the CEO. You make a deal and the CEO can leave."
Ali: But also the key people in those companies quickly leave, all of them, like the top management.
Ali: And then you keep promoting the people from below that couldn't get promoted before, and then eventually you bring in your own people to take over the company, and then the company is dead.
Ali: There's nothing left of it, and there's no integration between that asset that you bought and the platform that you have.
Ali: So to avoid all of those, can you get people that really feel like they're your co-founders?
Ali: So we spent just enormous amount of time with who we're, like, the company you're buying, who are the founders, how do they work, are we culturally the same?
Ali: Spend time with them. Do we get along? Do we see the world the same way? You know, are we going to click? Are we going to do this together?
Ali: Are we going to be able to build in the next five years? So that's where we spend number one.
Ali: Number two, we spend a lot of time on the product. What's the product experience? How would we integrate this? What would it look like?
Ali: How much can we rewrite most of it? Can we not rewrite it? What's the, what programming?
Ali: I always ask this, and people like, "Why? That's such a dumb question." I ask, "What language would you write it in?"
Ali: Like, "Why do you want to do that? What is, what does that matter?" "No, because we're going to integrate the code bases, right? It's like the build systems won't work. It's not going to even compile."
Ali: So a product is something we spend a huge amount of time, and talking to customers, understanding what the excitement around that product looks like and how the integration would look like.
Ali: The last thing we do is we look at the financials, what's the revenue multiple and how much can we grow it and what's the three-year plan, five-year plan and so on.
Ali: And I feel like big companies corporative departments do it exactly in the reverse order of this.
Ali: They start with, "Hey, the revenue is this, but we could accelerate it, and the multiple is so low."
Ali: "And in my Excel sheet here, this makes perfect sense."
Ali: And then second, they go to like, "Hey, is this a good product?" And then lastly, "How do we convince these knuckleheads?"
Ali: "I mean, we probably don't want to have them here, but we got to pay them off somehow."
Ali: So I think thinking about it that way, you get more longevity out of it.

Ali: 我们尽量不做的事情，让我们从一个简单的事情开始，就是很多公司，尤其是在规模化之后，他们会购买收入。
Ali: 所以他们会看一家公司，说：“嘿，这家公司规模是这样。我们直接收购这家公司。我们会投入更多的销售人员。然后我们就能加速收入增长。我们正在购买这份收入。”
Ali: 我们不是那样做的。我们真正做的是，第一，我们花大量时间与团队和创始人在一起。
Ali: 所以我们试图看看：“嘿，我们能一起建设吗？比如，你来这里，我们一起建设。”
Ali: 这与那种购买收入的模型非常不同。购买收入的模型往往从第一天起就与CEO分道扬镳。
Ali: 你可以看到那些大公司，他们实际上有一个计划。我有一些来自这些大公司的高管，他们说：“嘿，我们通常的计划是与CEO分道扬镳。你达成交易后，CEO就可以离开。”
Ali: 但那些公司里的关键人物也会很快离开，所有人都走，比如高层管理人员。
Ali: 然后你不断提拔那些以前无法获得晋升的下层员工，最终你引入自己的人来接管公司，然后公司就死了。
Ali: 它什么都不剩了，你收购的那个资产和你已有的平台之间也没有整合。
Ali: 所以为了避免所有这些，你能找到那些真正觉得自己是你的联合创始人的人吗？
Ali: 所以我们花大量时间与我们正在收购的公司、创始人在一起，了解他们如何工作，我们文化上是否一致？
Ali: 花时间与他们相处。我们合得来吗？我们看待世界的方式一样吗？我们会一拍即合吗？我们会一起做这件事吗？
Ali: 我们能在未来五年内共同建设吗？所以这是我们投入时间的第一点。
Ali: 第二，我们花大量时间在产品上。产品体验是什么？我们如何整合它？它会是什么样子？
Ali: 我们能重写大部分代码吗？我们不能重写它吗？编程语言是什么？
Ali: 我总是问这个问题，人们会说：“为什么？这真是个愚蠢的问题。”我问：“你们会用什么语言来编写它？”
Ali: 比如，“你为什么要那样做？那有什么关系？”“不，因为我们要整合代码库，对吧？就像构建系统会不兼容。它甚至无法编译。”
Ali: 所以产品是我们花费大量时间的事情，还有与客户交谈，了解围绕该产品的兴奋点是什么，以及整合会是什么样子。
Ali: 我们做的最后一件事是看财务数据，比如收入倍数，我们能增长多少，以及三年计划、五年计划等等。
Ali: 我觉得大公司的企业部门完全是按照相反的顺序来做的。
Ali: 他们从“嘿，收入是这么多，但我们可以加速增长，而且倍数很低”开始。
Ali: “在我的Excel表格里，这完全说得通。”
Ali: 然后第二步他们会说：“嘿，这是个好产品吗？”最后是：“我们如何说服这些笨蛋？”
Ali: “我的意思是，我们可能不希望他们留在这里，但我们必须以某种方式付清他们的钱。”
Ali: 所以我认为那样思考，你能从中获得更长的寿命。

### 产品架构与销售效率

Ben: This really comes, it sounds like he's talking like a product guy, but this is really the thing that people get wrong on the go-to-market.
Ben: Because what happens is if you've got multiple product architectures, that's going to mean multiple SE forces, multiple post-sales things, and your entire sales efficiency is going to go through the floor.
Ben: And because they have a keen eye on that, everything they buy ends up looking like a Databricks product.
Ben: And that work is going in. They're not just selling some crap to get some money to go on a corp dev thing.
Ben: And I would say so many, when you bring in a professional CEO, this is what they screw up because they don't understand that.

Ben: 这听起来他像是在谈产品，但这确实是人们在进入市场策略上犯错的地方。
Ben: 因为如果你有多种产品架构，那将意味着多套销售工程师团队，多套售后服务，你的整体销售效率会一落千丈。
Ben: 而因为他们对此有敏锐的洞察力，他们收购的一切最终都看起来像Databricks的产品。
Ben: 而且这项工作正在进行中。他们不仅仅是为了公司发展而卖掉一些垃圾来赚钱。
Ben: 我会说，很多时候，当你请来一位职业CEO时，他们会把这一点搞砸，因为他们不理解这一点。

Ali: Engineering goes, "Yeah, yeah, we can take it on. There's another set of engineers. We don't care if they work on that."
Ali: Blah, blah, blah. And engineering gets less efficient too, but it wrecks the field.
Ali: And then the customers hate it because, "Okay, I've got to learn another access control model. I've got to do this. I've got, you know, these are not things anybody wants to be part of."

Ali: 工程部门会说：“是啊，是啊，我们可以承担。还有另一组工程师。他们做那个我们不关心。”
Ali: 诸如此类。然后工程效率也会降低，但这会毁了市场。
Ali: 然后客户会讨厌它，因为，“好吧，我得学习另一种访问控制模型。我得做这个。我得，你知道，这些都不是任何人想参与的事情。”

Ben: Yeah, 100%. This is the go-to-market side that you're worried about.
Ben: That experience that those customers will have. They're going to come back immediately and say, "Hey, we were already upset about these things before the acquisition. Maybe you can fix them now."
Ben: It's like, "No, actually, several of those people actually quit, and now we're going to just work on integration, and that thing now got pushed out another two years."

Ben: 是的，百分之百。这就是你担心的进入市场方面的问题。
Ben: 那些客户会有的体验。他们会立刻回来抱怨说：“嘿，在收购之前，我们已经对这些事情很不满了。也许你们现在能解决它们？”
Ben: 结果是：“不，实际上，那些人中有几位已经辞职了，现在我们只专注于整合，那件事又被推迟了两年。”

Ali: So you don't want to be in that situation. There's a lot of companies that do that, and by the way, what they're doing works revenue-wise.
Ali: They are getting the revenue. They are getting the stock swap works. If they're multiple of the...

Ali: 所以你不想陷入那种境地。有很多公司都这样做，顺便说一句，他们正在做的事情在收入方面是有效的。
Ali: 他们确实获得了收入。他们确实获得了股票互换。如果他们是多重...

Ben: It's a creative deal temporarily.

Ben: 这暂时是一笔有创意的交易。

Ali: It works, and then the first year you get the bump in the revenue, you get a second year boost in revenue growth as well.
Ali: So the financial engineering actually works great for those companies. It's just long term. It ends up being like a bag of crap that doesn't work together.

Ali: 它确实有效，第一年你的收入会得到提升，第二年收入增长也会有所促进。
Ali: 所以对那些公司来说，金融工程实际上效果很好。只是长期来看。最终它会变成一堆无法协同工作的垃圾。

Ben: And it affects a brand. One of the things is, one of the reasons Databricks is so powerful is all their customers want to buy all their products because they're like, "We know that's the best software we buy."
Ben: And as soon as you start chipping away at that with these financial strategies, you can't get it back because the reputation is every customer's experience. There's no marketing through that.

Ben: 而且它会影响品牌。其中一点是，Databricks之所以如此强大，原因之一是他们所有的客户都想购买他们所有的产品，因为他们觉得：“我们知道那是我们能买到的最好的软件。”
Ben: 而一旦你用这些财务策略开始侵蚀这一点，你就无法挽回，因为声誉就是每个客户的体验。这方面没有营销可言。

Ali: It's the best software because it was written by the engineers and built by those that were the best.

Ali: 它是最好的软件，因为它是由最优秀的工程师编写和建造的。

Ben: Including the acquisitions that we got. They were phenomenal people that came in, and they continue, and since we gelled, they continued building it.
Ben: So that's why it's great. It's like, who are you getting into your company?

Ben: 包括我们所做的收购。那些加入的人都非常出色，他们持续工作，自从我们融合后，他们继续建设。
Ben: 这就是它很棒的原因。这就像是，你把什么样的人带进了你的公司？

Ali: That's the other thing, right? You can buy something that's got a lot of sales where you're downgrading your whole company.
Ali: **Ross Perot** (罗斯·佩罗: 美国商人、政治家，曾创立EDS公司) actually wrote about in **Citizen Perot** (《公民佩罗》: 罗斯·佩罗的自传) his biggest fear, which definitely came true, was he built this elite thing at **EDS** (电子数据系统公司: 罗斯·佩罗创立的IT服务公司), and then they would actually acquire IT departments.
Ali: And he was like, "They're going to absorb us, not vice versa." And that does happen.

Ali: 那是另一回事，对吧？你可以购买一个销售额很高的东西，结果却降低了你整个公司的水准。
Ali: **罗斯·佩罗**（Ross Perot: 美国商人、政治家，曾创立EDS公司）实际上在他的《**公民佩罗**》（Citizen Perot: 罗斯·佩罗的自传）中写下了他最大的恐惧，而这个恐惧确实成真了，那就是他在**EDS**（电子数据系统公司: 罗斯·佩罗创立的IT服务公司）建立了一个精英团队，然后他们会收购IT部门。
Ali: 他当时想：“他们会吸收我们，而不是我们吸收他们。”而这种情况确实发生了。

### 避免稀释：人才质量优先于交易规模

Ali: There is one really good company that we never acquired, and I always vetoed it whenever it came up because I just think that the quality of their employee base is not great, and I didn't want it to dilute Databricks.
Ali: Otherwise from every other angle, that deal always made sense, and I always vetoed it because I felt that, "It's just they're all going to quit or be super unhappy. Let's just not do it."
Ali: It's also why merger of equals are because...

Ali: 有一家非常好的公司，我们从未收购过，每当它被提起时我都会否决，因为我只是觉得他们的员工基础质量不高，我不想稀释Databricks的水平。
Ali: 否则从其他所有角度来看，那笔交易总是很有吸引力，但我总是否决它，因为我觉得：“他们都会辞职或者非常不开心。我们还是别做了。”
Ali: 这也是为什么所谓的“对等合并”会发生，因为……

Ben: Because the cultures aren't equal. The people aren't equal.

Ben: 因为文化不平等。人不平等。

Host: And what made you feel that way? You just spent time with them and they just didn't exude sort of Databricks culture?

Host: 是什么让你有那种感觉？你只是和他们相处过，他们没有散发出Databricks的文化气息吗？

Ali: Well, I mean, it's like with everything else. It's like when we were grading students at the university.
Ali: The rock stars are super easy to find out. So they're like there.
Ali: And then the people that are really, really bad, that's like it's not hard.
Ali: And then there are people in the middle, that's in the gray zone.
Ali: This was a company that was, I feel like the talent is not phenomenal, and you don't need to be a genius to know that.
Ali: And then there's some startups, immediately, okay, these guys are Olympia winners, and they're phenomenal, and they're executing like crazy, and they have a track record.
Ali: So I don't think those are that hard, and we try to hire these, and this is the one that I vetoed.
Ali: The hard part is what do you do with the ones in the middle?

Ali: 嗯，我的意思是，这就像其他所有事情一样。就像我们在大学里给学生打分时。
Ali: 那些摇滚明星（顶尖人才）很容易就能发现。他们就在那里。
Ali: 然后那些非常非常差的人，那也不难发现。
Ali: 然后是中间的人，那是在灰色地带。
Ali: 这是一家公司，我觉得他们的人才并不出色，你不需要是天才就能知道这一点。
Ali: 然后有一些初创公司，立刻就能看出，好吧，这些人是奥林匹亚冠军，他们非常出色，执行力惊人，而且有良好的记录。
Ali: 所以我认为那些并不难，我们试图雇佣这些人，而我否决的就是中间的那些。
Ali: 困难的部分是，你如何处理中间的那些人？

Ben: That's always where you spend all of your energy trying to suss out.
Ben: Okay, they're not stellar, stellar, but maybe they are.
Ben: Maybe they just didn't have the go-to-market, they didn't have the funding, they didn't have the support that they needed and so on.
Ben: Maybe they could if we give them a chance, or maybe they're just mediocre.
Ben: And that's where you spend a lot of your time. But you got to spend time with them. You have to interview all the people.
Ben: You have to have your people interview all the people. Can't just be this can't be an Excel sheet exercise.

Ben: 那总是你花费所有精力去摸索的地方。
Ben: 好吧，他们不是顶尖的，但也许他们是。
Ben: 也许他们只是没有进入市场策略，没有资金，没有他们需要的支持等等。
Ben: 也许如果我们给他们一个机会，他们就能成功，或者他们只是平庸。
Ben: 那就是你花费大量时间的地方。但你必须花时间与他们相处。你必须面试所有的人。
Ben: 你必须让你的员工面试所有的人。这不能仅仅是一个Excel表格练习。

### 硅谷的偏科公司与销售天才

Ali: Yeah. And Silicon Valley has a lot of lopsided companies.
Ali: So you'll have a great engineering team and a bad company because it's like bad leadership, bad go-to-market.
Ali: You also can have guys who can sell anything with a ridiculously poor engineering team, and they can just sell it.
Ali: And you got to be very, very careful about that.
Ali: Actually our **CRO** (首席营收官: 负责公司所有营收增长活动的高级管理人员) at Databricks is, he came from a company that he can sell anything.

Ali: 是的。硅谷有很多发展不平衡的公司。
Ali: 所以你可能会有一个很棒的工程团队，但公司却很糟糕，因为领导力差，进入市场策略也差。
Ali: 你也可能遇到一些人，他们有一个极其糟糕的工程团队，但却能卖出任何东西，而且他们就是能卖出去。
Ali: 你必须非常非常小心这一点。
Ali: 实际上，我们Databricks的**首席营收官**（CRO: 负责公司所有营收增长活动的高级管理人员），他来自一家他能卖出任何东西的公司。

Ben: He was selling **SFTP** (安全文件传输协议: 一种通过SSH加密连接传输文件的网络协议), which is free, and he was selling it for a while. He was selling it for a lot. He was making a lot of money.
Ben: We're saying, "You know, the electronic medical health records, how important are they? If they got dropped, how much of a risk is it to your business?"
Ben: "Well, this is secure SFTP. You need it to be secure on somebody grabbing that file." He's good.

Ben: 他当时在卖**SFTP**（安全文件传输协议: 一种通过SSH加密连接传输文件的网络协议），那是免费的，但他卖了一段时间。他卖得很贵。他赚了很多钱。
Ben: 我们说：“你知道，电子病历有多重要？如果它们丢失了，对你的业务有多大风险？”
Ben: “嗯，这是安全的SFTP。你需要确保有人抓取那个文件时是安全的。”他很厉害。

### 收购的声誉与前例

Host: The only thing I'd add too is this strategy is probably making you more attractive to the people you want to acquire too. They don't want to sell if they're going to get fired right away.

Host: 我唯一要补充的是，这种策略可能也会让你对那些你想收购的人更具吸引力。如果他们会被立即解雇，他们就不想出售。

Ali: For sure. It's very competitive.

Ali: 当然。竞争非常激烈。

Ben: 100%. There's also a reputation, right? People know. They'll look back and say, "Okay, what happened to your previous acquisitions?"
Ben: "Was there a huge fight and everybody's quitting left and right? Or did they work out?"
Ben: "How are you taking care of those people? What roles do they have? Do they have influential roles in your company?"
Ben: That's also important. So you're setting a precedent. You're setting a precedent in many, many ways with acquisitions, **M&A** (并购: 公司合并与收购), deal dynamics, the price.
Ben: When you go through the lawyers, come back, and you're spending all those 20, 30 days doing the definitive agreement. Every little thing you agree to there is a precedent for the next deal.

Ben: 百分之百。还有声誉，对吧？人们都知道。他们会回顾说：“好吧，你之前的收购怎么样了？”
Ben: “是不是发生了大规模冲突，大家纷纷离职？还是他们成功了？”
Ben: “你如何照顾那些人？他们担任什么角色？他们在公司里有影响力吗？”
Ben: 这也很重要。所以你正在树立一个先例。你在很多很多方面都树立了先例，包括收购、**并购**（M&A: 公司合并与收购）、交易动态、价格。
Ben: 当你通过律师、回来，然后你花费那20、30天来制定最终协议。你在那里同意的每一个小细节，都为下一笔交易树立了先例。

Host: Yep. Totally.

Host: 是的。完全正确。

### Ben的“千亿市值”预言与思维拓展

Host: Maybe actually just to turn so we're talking about Databricks as an acquirer.
Host: If we go back in time again to maybe a moment where you thought about selling, and maybe that you didn't actually seriously consider that.
Host: But I wanted to actually just sort of quote this infamous email sort of circulating our firm that Ben sent to...

Host: 也许，实际上，我们现在谈论的是Databricks作为一家收购方。
Host: 如果我们再次回到过去，也许是某个你考虑出售的时刻，也许你当时并没有真正认真考虑过。
Host: 但我实际上想引用本发给我们公司的一封臭名昭著的邮件，它在我们公司内部流传……

Ali: Ali brought it. I had forgotten about it. You brought it up at a board meeting.

Ali: 阿里提到了它。我都忘了。你在一次董事会议上提起了它。

Host: Brought it to the bed. But this was not pertaining to selling the company, but it was, I think, selling a candidate.
Host: And you talk about, "Hey, Ben, can you sell this candidate on the fact that we'll be worth 10 billion?"
Host: Maybe the candidate was worried about the company getting...

Host: 带到了董事会。但这与出售公司无关，我想，是关于说服一位候选人。
Host: 你谈到：“嘿，本，你能说服这位候选人，让他相信我们公司将价值100亿美元吗？”
Host: 也许这位候选人担心公司会……

Ali: He wanted to have a **double trigger** (双重触发: 股权协议中的条款，指在特定情况下（如公司被收购且员工被解雇）员工的股权将立即完全归属). Because the company, if Databricks sells, "Am I, and they fire me as a salesperson, what equity am I going to get?"
Ali: "So give me double trigger so I'm protected if we get bought and I get fired, I vest all my equity immediately."

Ali: 他想要一个**双重触发**（double trigger: 股权协议中的条款，指在特定情况下（如公司被收购且员工被解雇）员工的股权将立即完全归属）条款。因为如果公司，如果Databricks被出售，“如果我作为销售人员被解雇，我能得到多少股权？”
Ali: “所以给我双重触发条款，这样如果公司被收购而我被解雇，我的所有股权就能立即归属，我就受到保护。”

Host: Yep. Exactly. And so, in response to this, Ben, and I'm going to paraphrase this a little bit, but he writes back to you, and I'm thinking about Ben's tone in this.
Host: "You are severely underselling the opportunity. We are Oracle in the cloud, and we will be worth 10x what Oracle is."
Host: But what was your reaction when you when you saw that? And did that give you more fortitude to not sell the company?

Host: 是的。没错。所以，针对这个，本，我稍微转述一下，他回信给你，我正在想象本的语气。
Host: “你严重低估了这个机会。我们是云端的**甲骨文**（Oracle: 一家大型软件公司），我们的价值将是甲骨文的十倍。”
Host: 但你看到那封信时的反应是什么？那是否给了你更大的勇气不去出售公司？

Ali: Ben's crazy.

Ali: 本真是个疯子。

Ali: I think the first thought was exactly, "Ben's crazy." But no, I think both Ben and Mark always kind of pushed us to think bigger.
Ali: I remember we did the pitch at A16Z for I think our Series D, which would have been around 2017 or so.
Ali: And the question was asked, "What's your biggest bottleneck?" And I said, "Biggest bottleneck is hiring."
Ali: He said, "Okay, well, who are you losing to?" And I said, "Well, it's Google, it's the **FANGs** (FANG: 指Facebook（现Meta）、Amazon、Netflix和Google（现Alphabet）四家大型科技公司)."
Ali: And the response I got back was, "Well, you need to just add the Databricks to FANG. It needs to be FANG DB with a straight face."
Ali: And I was like, and my reaction was I laughed. I literally said, "Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is not serious."
Ali: It's like, "Yeah, that's the problem." Like, "Huh?" It's like, "No, I'm serious. You need to add Databricks to FANG."
Ali: And then there was like a pause, and there was like this, and I think it's doable.
Ali: And so then I actually went back and thought about it a lot, and I was like, "Is it doable? Am I the crazy one or are they the crazy one? Who's the crazy one here? Who's nuts here?"
Ali: And that kind of pushed us to think about how do we change our comp philosophy?
Ali: How do we, if we wanted to go and get the best of the best out of Google, what does it require?
Ali: And we developed a new model, but we're like, "Okay, actually, the way to think about it is your **market cap** (市值: 公司所有流通股的总价值) divided by number of employees."
Ali: "That's how much money you can give away in terms of dilution."
Ali: And actually we did calculated the number at that time, and we're like, "Wait, we're actually richer than Google in terms of how much dilution we can afford per engineer."
Ali: Because they were at that time, this was like before the Twitter downsizing, so all the companies were oversized.
Ali: So we did the calculations, it turned out that we actually can probably pay **P95th percentile** (95百分位: 在一个数据集中，有95%的数据点低于该值).
Ali: We did the math on P95th percentile for engineering, and it was like, "Yeah, this actually the math works out."
Ali: We moved all the comp bands and we told them and we told the employees about it. It's like, "Okay, we're paying you P95th, and we can afford it."
Ali: So that came out of that simple, you know, "your trillion dollars, just add your acronym to the to FANG" and so on.
Ali: They're silly and they're kind of crazy, but they do push you.
Ali: And you go back and think about, "Hey, what is the fundamental reason from first principles that we couldn't do something like that? Why couldn't we be a trillion? What's the bottleneck from being a trillion or being part of FANG?"
Ali: And then you think about it and you start zooming in on like, "Can we unblock that?"
Ali: So it has helped us and has been a driving force even though it's a little annoying.
Ali: It's like, "Hey, mom, dad, I got the A+. I was number two in the class. So was someone better than you?"

Ali: 我想第一个念头就是：“本真是个疯子。”但不是，我认为本和马克总是推动我们思考更宏大的目标。
Ali: 我记得我们在A16Z为我们的D轮融资进行了演示，那大约是在2017年左右。
Ali: 有人问：“你最大的瓶颈是什么？”我说：“最大的瓶颈是招聘。”
Ali: 他说：“好吧，那你输给了谁？”我说：“嗯，是谷歌，是那些**FANGs**（FANG: 指Facebook（现Meta）、Amazon、Netflix和Google（现Alphabet）四家大型科技公司）。”
Ali: 然后我得到的回复是：“嗯，你只需要把Databricks加到FANG里就行了。它需要是FANG DB，而且要一本正经地说。”
Ali: 我当时，我的反应是笑了。我真的说：“是啊，是啊。我的意思是，这不严肃。”
Ali: 就像是：“是啊，这就是问题。”然后他问：“嗯？”他接着说：“不，我是认真的。你需要把Databricks加到FANG里。”
Ali: 然后停顿了一下，然后就是这样，我觉得这是可以做到的。
Ali: 所以我真的回去仔细思考了很久，我当时想：“这真的可以做到吗？是我疯了还是他们疯了？这里谁是疯子？谁是神经病？”
Ali: 而这在某种程度上推动我们思考如何改变我们的薪酬理念？
Ali: 如果我们想从谷歌那里挖到最优秀的人才，需要什么？
Ali: 我们开发了一个新的模型，但我们觉得：“好吧，实际上，思考这个问题的方式是，你的**市值**（market cap: 公司所有流通股的总价值）除以员工人数。”
Ali: “这就是你在稀释方面可以给予多少钱。”
Ali: 实际上我们当时计算了这个数字，我们发现：“等等，就我们每个工程师能够承受的稀释程度而言，我们实际上比谷歌更富有。”
Ali: 因为他们当时，这就像在Twitter裁员之前，所以所有的公司都过于臃肿。
Ali: 所以我们进行了计算，结果发现我们实际上可能可以支付**95百分位**（P95th percentile: 在一个数据集中，有95%的数据点低于该值）的薪酬。
Ali: 我们对工程人员的95百分位进行了数学计算，结果是：“是啊，这个数学确实行得通。”
Ali: 我们调整了所有的薪酬区间，并告诉了他们，也告诉了员工。就像是：“好吧，我们正在支付你95百分位的薪酬，而且我们负担得起。”
Ali: 所以这都源于那个简单的，你知道，“你的万亿美元，只需把你的公司缩写加到FANG里”等等。
Ali: 它们很傻，也有点疯狂，但它们确实能推动你。
Ali: 你会回过头来思考：“嘿，从第一性原理来看，我们为什么不能做那样的事情？我们为什么不能达到万亿美元市值？从达到万亿美元市值或成为FANG的一部分来看，瓶颈是什么？”
Ali: 然后你思考它，并开始深入研究：“我们能解除这个瓶颈吗？”
Ali: 所以它帮助了我们，并一直是一个推动力，尽管它有点烦人。
Ali: 这就像是：“嘿，爸爸妈妈，我得了A+。我班上排名第二。那有没有人比你更好？”

Host: Yeah.

Host: 是的。

### 独特的市场机遇与创业者的稀缺性

Host: For what it's worth when I joined the firm in 2019, the Series F of Databricks was the first deal I worked on.
Host: And I think the valuation was 6 billion.
Host: Ben says to us, "Oh, well, it's going to be a hundred billion dollar company." And we were like, "Yeah, yeah, sure, Ben."
Host: Lo and behold, they're doing all this work. I'm like, "What are you doing? Six billion, seven billion, doesn't matter."

Host: 说句公道话，我2019年加入公司时，Databricks的F轮融资是我经手的第一个项目。
Host: 我记得当时的估值是60亿美元。
Host: 本对我们说：“哦，它会成为一家千亿美元的公司。”我们当时想：“是啊，是啊，当然了，本。”
Host: 结果，他们正在做所有这些工作。我想：“你们在做什么？60亿，70亿，都无所谓。”

Ben: I was right.

Ben: 我是对的。

Host: He was right. That one you have proven to be right. Still have ways to go for two trillion. But...

Host: 他是对的。那一点你已经证明是对的。离两万亿美元还有很长的路要走。但是……

Ben: The thing that you almost never get, and Ali and I had this conversation the one time we did have a real acquisition offer on the company, is you just don't get this good a market opportunity with this good an entrepreneur like that.
Ben: That's the rarest of rare things. We see great entrepreneurs, but their market opportunity is limited.
Ben: And then we see companies that have a great market opportunity, but the entrepreneur is not big enough to fulfill that.
Ben: But this was a case where we have both.

Ben: 你几乎从未得到的东西，我和阿里在公司确实收到过一次真正的收购要约时谈论过，那就是你很少能遇到如此好的市场机会和如此优秀的创业者。
Ben: 那是稀有中的稀有。我们看到伟大的创业者，但他们的市场机会有限。
Ben: 然后我们看到拥有巨大市场机会的公司，但创业者不够强大，无法实现那个机会。
Ben: 但这次我们两者兼备。

### 拒绝收购：本的“后悔”忠告

Ali: I remember actually the conversation that kind of flipped me. The acquisition offer was on the table.
Ali: It was six times bigger than the valuation we had at the time. And I had done the mistake of telling my co-founders.
Ali: And yeah, they were like, "Let's go." They were like, "We're done."
Ali: So everyone's like, "Stop the work. Stop working. Take your hands off the keyboard. Nobody work anymore. We're done here." Right?
Ali: "And let's count my money. How much money do I have? What would you buy for that amount of money?"
Ali: So they were completely not doing anything. And there's just this crazy gossip going around.
Ali: And then it was like they had told some of the exec, and then they were calling each other every day like, "Hey, what Ali think? You think he's, he looked in a bad mood today. You think he's going to say no?"
Ali: "No, it's like, what did he say? He said this thing. He said this once."
Ali: So there's just a lot of politicking going around, and nobody was doing any work anymore.
Ali: And I was like, "You know, maybe they're right, maybe we should just sell."
Ali: And I remember having that conversation with Ben, and I think we were in a car, both of us.
Ali: And he says that he drops the F-bombs and he pisses people off and so on, and they don't take the feedback.
Ali: But actually he did exactly the Radical Candor thing with me, which is he said, "Hey, you can do whatever you want. I'll support you either case."
Ali: "And actually if you sell for this number, it's really great for me, me being Ben. We make a lot of money at A16Z. I'll pay the investors back many times over. So honestly, if it's for me personally, that's probably the better option."
Ali: "But I'm just thinking back, I was CEO of LoudCloud, Opsware, and just the cards I were given, that company wasn't the company you have."
Ali: "And when I look back, how often do you in life get a chance to even have a company like LoudCloud or Opsware, let alone a Databricks?"
Ali: "And this is just such a freaking big market. You can sell, you're going to make a lot of money, and you'll be super successful in life."
Ali: "But if you're like me, you're going to look back the rest of your life thinking, 'I missed that one shot. That was the one thing. I should have taken it all the way. And now I'll never know how far I could have taken it. Could have been.'"
Ali: "So, do you want to live with that or do you want to just have the money? I'll support whatever you want to do. I really couldn't care less. I really couldn't care less."
Ali: And I was like, "Okay, thanks. Hang up. We're never doing this. We're done. This is not happening."

Ali: 我记得那次真正改变我想法的对话。收购要约摆在桌面上。
Ali: 它的估值是我们当时估值的六倍。我犯了个错误，告诉了我的联合创始人。
Ali: 是的，他们都说：“我们走吧。”他们都说：“我们完事了。”
Ali: 所以每个人都说：“停止工作。别再工作了。把手从键盘上拿开。没人再工作了。我们到此为止了。”对吧？
Ali: “然后我们来数数我的钱。我有多少钱？你会用这么多钱买什么？”
Ali: 所以他们完全什么都不做。而且到处都是疯狂的八卦。
Ali: 然后他们好像告诉了一些高管，然后他们每天互相打电话说：“嘿，阿里怎么想？你觉得他今天心情不好。你觉得他会拒绝吗？”
Ali: “不，他说了什么？他说了这句话。他只说过一次。”
Ali: 所以到处都是政治斗争，没有人再工作了。
Ali: 我当时想：“你知道，也许他们是对的，也许我们应该直接卖掉。”
Ali: 我记得和本有过那次对话，我想我们俩当时都在车里。
Ali: 他说他会爆粗口，他会惹恼别人等等，他们不接受反馈。
Ali: 但实际上，他对我的做法完全符合“彻底坦率”的原则，他说：“嘿，你想怎么做都行。无论哪种情况我都支持你。”
Ali: “而且实际上，如果你以这个数字出售，对我来说真的很好，就我本个人而言。我们在A16Z赚了很多钱。我会多次回报投资者。所以老实说，如果对我个人来说，那可能是更好的选择。”
Ali: “但我只是回想一下，我曾是LoudCloud和Opsware的CEO，而我当时所拥有的牌，那家公司并不是你现在拥有的公司。”
Ali: “当我回首时，人生中有多少次机会能拥有像LoudCloud或Opsware这样的公司，更不用说Databricks了？”
Ali: “而且这真是一个巨大的市场。你可以出售，你会赚很多钱，你的人生会非常成功。”
Ali: “但如果你像我一样，你会在余生中回望，心想‘我错过了那一次机会。那是我应该坚持到底的一件事。现在我永远都不会知道我能把它做到多远。可能本可以的。’”
Ali: “所以，你愿意带着这种遗憾生活，还是只想拥有金钱？你想做什么我都支持。我真的无所谓。我真的无所谓。”
Ali: 我当时想：“好吧，谢谢。挂断电话。我们永远不会这样做。我们结束了。这不会发生。”

Host: What a pep talk.

Host: 多么鼓舞人心的一席话。

Ali: So that's how we did it. It was excellent.

Ali: 我们就是这样做的。非常棒。

Ben: I think I also said, "I guarantee you you'll never have an idea this good again as long as you live."

Ben: 我想我还说过：“我向你保证，你这辈子再也不会有这么好的主意了。”

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: This is the best idea you're ever going to have.

Ben: 这是你这辈子能有的最好的主意了。

Ali: Yeah. Well, an idea that also takes off and works, right?

Ali: 是啊。一个能够起飞并奏效的想法，对吧？

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

### AI人才战：薪酬与职业发展

Host: So I want to tie one thing that you said in all of that is you were company building.
Host: But then also just the calculus that founders but also your employees are making, and that's around comp.
Host: In the early days you could afford to pay 95th percentile, right?
Host: Today there's crazy AI talent wars going on. We've talked about this a bunch throughout the summer.
Host: And we know that you can bring the best talent in the house to Databricks.
Host: How do you keep them with all of this craziness going on? Because now 95th percentile, I don't even know what that means. Is that like you pay a billion dollars?

Host: 所以我想把你在这一切中提到的一件事联系起来，那就是你正在建设公司。
Host: 但同时，创始人和你的员工都在进行计算，这与薪酬有关。
Host: 在早期，你们能负担得起支付95百分位的薪酬，对吧？
Host: 今天正在上演疯狂的AI人才战。我们整个夏天都在谈论这个。
Host: 我们知道你们能把最优秀的人才带到Databricks。
Host: 在所有这些疯狂的情况下，你们如何留住他们？因为现在95百分位，我甚至不知道那意味着什么。那是不是意味着你支付十亿美元？

Ali: Exactly. The joke is which company says, "We're P50th?" You know, "We pay P50th." Like who does that? There's no company that does that.

Ali: 没错。玩笑是哪家公司会说：“我们是50百分位？”你知道，“我们支付50百分位。”谁会那样做？没有公司会那样做。

Ben: There is. The 75th percentile is the single biggest lie in Silicon Valley. It's a complete fabrication probably.
Ben: So, I think that it is a crazy time with AI, and I do think I feel bad.
Ben: I did an exit interview with someone this morning. I feel bad for the kids right now because there's too much pressure on them.
Ben: They feel like, "Oh, they have to start companies," and "They have to."
Ben: And I've never actually had anything like this because every year I talk to the interns.
Ben: And I get questions about, "How do we build our own company? How do we succeed at Databricks?"
Ben: The last two years have just been crazy. All the kids are like, "When should I become a CEO? When should I start my own company? What's a good valuation? Am I missing out if I do an internship here for three months at Databricks? Will I have wasted my opportunity in life?"
Ben: "And this is the time for **AGI** (通用人工智能: 指具有人类智能水平，能够执行任何人类智力任务的人工智能)."
Ben: "And I could have been one of the guys that does super intelligence."
Ben: "And how would you time that? How was it for you? How old were you when you were 22? What did you do?"
Ben: So I do think it's crazy times, and I do think it's also exaggerated.
Ben: I don't think anyone's getting hundred million dollar offers. I mean, yes, there's **Character AI** (Character AI: 一家通过大型语言模型创建可定制AI角色的公司) and so on. But I don't think it's actually true.
Ben: And it's also in the interest of CEOs, you should know, to say that, "Hey, people try to poach data people from Databricks for a billion dollars, and they said no."
Ben: It's in our interest to say that, right? Because that kind of sets the bar at a billion.
Ben: And then any employee that cannot, for half of it, is going to feel really insulted. It's like, "Why don't I get a billion dollar offer? I heard on the news that the other people are getting a billion."

Ben: 有的。75百分位是硅谷最大的谎言。那可能完全是捏造的。
Ben: 所以，我认为现在是人工智能的疯狂时代，我确实感到难过。
Ben: 我今天早上和一个人进行了离职面谈。我现在为这些年轻人感到难过，因为他们承受了太大的压力。
Ben: 他们觉得：“哦，他们必须创业，”而且“他们必须。”
Ben: 我以前从未遇到过这样的情况，因为我每年都会和实习生交谈。
Ben: 我会收到关于“我们如何建立自己的公司？我们如何在Databricks取得成功？”的问题。
Ben: 过去两年简直是疯了。所有的孩子都在问：“我什么时候应该成为CEO？我什么时候应该创办自己的公司？一个好的估值是多少？如果我在Databricks实习三个月，我是否错过了机会？我是否浪费了人生中的机会？”
Ben: “现在是**通用人工智能**（AGI: 指具有人类智能水平，能够执行任何人类智力任务的人工智能）的时代。”
Ben: “我本可以成为那些创造超级智能的人之一。”
Ben: “你会如何把握时机？对你来说是怎样的？你22岁时多大？你做了什么？”
Ben: 所以我确实认为现在是疯狂的时代，我也认为它被夸大了。
Ben: 我不认为有人能拿到上亿美元的报价。我的意思是，是的，有**Character AI**（Character AI: 一家通过大型语言模型创建可定制AI角色的公司）等等。但我不认为这是真的。
Ben: 而且，你应该知道，CEO们也有兴趣说：“嘿，有人试图以十亿美元从Databricks挖走数据人才，但他们拒绝了。”
Ben: 说这种话符合我们的利益，对吧？因为这为薪酬设定了十亿美元的门槛。
Ben: 然后任何无法达到一半的员工都会感到非常受侮辱。就像是：“为什么我没有拿到十亿美元的报价？我听说新闻上说其他人拿到了十亿美元。”

Ali: By the way, Sam used that in reverse on **Meta** (Meta: Facebook公司更名后的名称). He's like, "Oh yeah, they offered all our guys hundred million dollars."
Ali: And the next guy who got the 50, "Now I have to pay 100 at least." That's like the smart move.
Ali: But I would say that not all startups have the valuation of their, we're 100 billion, and with 10,000 employees, we actually can afford to actually pay significant and we do pay significant for the right talent.
Ali: But what do you do when you're smaller like we were smaller at some point?
Ali: Well then it's talk about how big you are going to get and what the opportunity is and what you could do together and what it would be worth together.
Ali: But I think most people earlier in the career, they really want to learn and they want to really feel that they can have impact.
Ali: So if you can really bring them in and you can mentor them, you can stay close to them.
Ali: And as a CEO, you have huge power if you can just spend two minutes with a kid out of school. It's immense to them.
Ali: And you say, "Hey, I'll even mentor you. I'll help you."
Ali: "What do you want to do in five years? I'm thinking about starting my own company actually in six months."
Ali: "You know, but I'll work at Databricks for 10 years, but in six months, I would love to be a CEO."
Ali: So then you can say, "Hey, I can coach you to, I know how the fundraising, I know the early days and so on."
Ali: And you can actually mentor a lot of them, and that's actually worth a lot to them as well.
Ali: But in general, help them be successful and help them build their careers.
Ali: And also if you've done it before like we have, you can kind of calm them down a little bit and say, "Hey, you have a few decades."
Ali: "Don't worry about it. It's the **FOMO** (错失恐惧症: 一种害怕错过社交活动、新体验或投资机会的焦虑情绪) and the pressure has to be kind of reduced."
Ali: And I think that's also calming, they feel good about it.

Ali: 顺便说一句，萨姆（Sam）反过来利用这一点对付**Meta**（Meta: Facebook公司更名后的名称）。他说：“哦，是的，他们给我们所有人都提供了1亿美元的报价。”
Ali: 而下一个拿到5000万美元的人，现在我至少得付1亿美元。这就像是聪明的做法。
Ali: 但我想说的是，并非所有初创公司都有我们这样的估值，我们是千亿美元公司，拥有1万名员工，我们确实能够而且也确实为合适的人才支付高额薪酬。
Ali: 但当你像我们某个时期那样规模较小时，你会怎么做？
Ali: 那就是谈论你将发展到多大，机会是什么，你们能一起做什么，以及它共同的价值会是多少。
Ali: 但我认为大多数处于职业生涯早期的人，他们真的想学习，他们真的想感受到自己能产生影响。
Ali: 所以如果你能真正地把他们带进来，并且你能指导他们，你可以和他们保持密切联系。
Ali: 作为CEO，如果你能花两分钟和一个刚毕业的孩子交流，你拥有巨大的影响力。这对他们来说是巨大的。
Ali: 你说：“嘿，我甚至会指导你。我会帮助你。”
Ali: “你五年后想做什么？我实际上在考虑六个月后创办自己的公司。”
Ali: “你知道，但我会在Databricks工作10年，但六个月后，我很想成为一名CEO。”
Ali: 那么你就可以说：“嘿，我可以指导你，我知道如何融资，我知道早期阶段等等。”
Ali: 你实际上可以指导他们很多人，这对他们来说也很有价值。
Ali: 但总的来说，帮助他们成功，帮助他们建立职业生涯。
Ali: 而且，如果你像我们一样以前做过，你可以稍微安抚他们，说：“嘿，你还有几十年的时间呢。”
Ali: “别担心。那是**错失恐惧症**（FOMO: 一种害怕错过社交活动、新体验或投资机会的焦虑情绪），压力必须减轻一些。”
Ali: 我认为那也让他们感到平静，他们对此感觉良好。

### 创业的磨砺与人才回流

Ben: Yeah. I always say the best cure for starting your own company fever is to start your own company and that'll teach you.

Ben: 是的。我总是说，治疗创业热的最佳方法就是自己去创业，那会教你很多东西。

Ali: It's not that easy.
Ali: By the way, they come back after start companies. Often times they come back to Databricks, and they're much more thankful and you understand.
Ali: And actually I didn't mention this earlier when you asked about acquisitions.
Ali: My favorite acquisition, because I said they start with the people, right? And then the product.
Ali: And with the people, I love to hire people who have seen great at a big company, or I don't know if it's great, but they've seen process scale big company.
Ali: They've been at a Google, they've been at Amazon, they understand the processes so that I understand how to navigate a bureaucracy and work with it, and they're not going to just be inundated by it.
Ali: But then they've gone on and done their own startup, and that's really, really hard. It's extremely hard trying to do everything yourself.
Ali: And you don't have any help, and you're trying to do this in this crazy market, and you're trying to compete with hundred million dollar offers when you have nothing.
Ali: So that takes a certain amount of grit, and it's really humbling.
Ali: So I love the people that have done both of those. They end up being actually the perfect employees at Databricks because they come in and they're really thankful.
Ali: They're like, "Hey, what these guys have done at Databricks is actually really, really hard. I tried it, and I'm really good. I was like one of the best at Google or somewhere, and then I did my own startup, and we absolutely failed."
Ali: "And so, hey, show some respect here. These guys know what they're talking about."
Ali: So those are great employees actually.
Ali: So, keep a great relationship with people who leave your company because they can boomerang back in a couple of years.

Ali: 没那么容易。
Ali: 顺便说一句，他们创业后会回来。很多时候，他们会回到Databricks，他们会更感激，你也会理解。
Ali: 实际上，你刚才问收购时我没有提到这一点。
Ali: 我最喜欢的收购，因为我说他们从人开始，对吧？然后是产品。
Ali: 而在人的方面，我喜欢雇佣那些在大公司见过大世面的人，或者我不知道是不是大世面，但他们见过大型公司的流程规模。
Ali: 他们曾在谷歌或亚马逊工作过，他们理解这些流程，这样我就知道如何驾驭官僚体系并与之合作，他们不会被其淹没。
Ali: 但他们后来又去创办了自己的初创公司，那真的非常非常难。自己做所有事情极其困难。
Ali: 而且你没有任何帮助，你在这个疯狂的市场中努力，当你一无所有时，你却试图与上亿美元的报价竞争。
Ali: 所以那需要一定的毅力，而且非常令人谦卑。
Ali: 所以我喜欢那些两者都做过的人。他们最终实际上成为了Databricks的完美员工，因为他们进来后非常感激。
Ali: 他们会说：“嘿，这些人在Databricks做的事情真的非常非常难。我尝试过，我真的很棒。我曾是谷歌或其他地方最优秀的人之一，然后我创办了自己的初创公司，我们彻底失败了。”
Ali: “所以，嘿，请在这里表示一些尊重。这些人知道他们在说什么。”
Ali: 所以那些实际上是优秀的员工。
Ali: 所以，与离开你公司的人保持良好关系，因为他们几年后可能会回流。

### 创业的运气与时机

Ben: Yeah. And look, it's very hard to make these things work.
Ben: And it also requires a lot of luck. I mean, I think one of the things people don't realize is a lot of things have to go right that should never go right.
Ben: And a lot of things will go wrong, but if you can grab your lucky moments, that's a rare, that's a rare thing.

Ben: 是的。听着，要让这些事情成功非常困难。
Ben: 这也需要很多运气。我的意思是，我认为人们没有意识到的一点是，很多本不应该顺利的事情却必须顺利。
Ben: 很多事情都会出错，但如果你能抓住你的幸运时刻，那是一种罕见，一种罕见的事情。

Ali: One way to prove that is if Databricks started in 2013.
Ali: If we had started in 2012, that rocky year, that difficult year, 2015, would have then happened in 2014, right?
Ali: We don't have the revenue. But we were a cloud AI open source company. Those things didn't take off in 2014.
Ali: So even if we had to do the CEO change and all of that, and I had become CEO a year earlier, it just we were too early in the market.
Ali: The cloud hadn't taken off. AI was not, nobody, that was not even a phrase. AI meant robotics.
Ali: People use **machine learning** (机器学习: 人工智能的一个分支，使计算机系统能够从数据中学习并改进，而无需明确编程) as the phrase. And so company would have failed. We wouldn't have had enough momentum.
Ali: There's not enough cloud **TAM** (总潜在市场: 一个产品或服务在理想情况下的最大市场规模) there to be had.
Ali: If we started the company in 2014, a year later instead, so a year later than we actually did, then we would have had our difficult year in 2016.
Ali: But by 2016, the cloud was starting to happen, AI was starting to happen.
Ali: So we would have done the fixes in 2017, and it would have been too late to the party, and probably the **hyperscalers** (超大规模云服务商: 提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、Google Cloud) would have taken it away.
Ali: Our competitors were taking it away, and we just wouldn't have get enough momentum to be able to succeed. And that's timing of when we started.
Ali: So, how did we clock it so well? We had to wait for Mate to finish his PhD thesis. That's it.

Ali: 有一种方法可以证明这一点，那就是如果Databricks是在2013年成立的。
Ali: 如果我们是在2012年成立的，那么那个艰难的2015年，就会在2014年发生，对吧？
Ali: 我们没有收入。但我们是一家云端AI开源公司。那些东西在2014年并没有起飞。
Ali: 所以即使我们进行了CEO更换等等，而且我提前一年成为了CEO，我们也只是太早进入市场了。
Ali: 云计算还没有起飞。人工智能还没有，没有人，那甚至不是一个词。AI当时指的是机器人技术。
Ali: 人们用**机器学习**（machine learning: 人工智能的一个分支，使计算机系统能够从数据中学习并改进，而无需明确编程）这个词。所以公司会失败。我们不会有足够的势头。
Ali: 那里没有足够的云**总潜在市场**（TAM: 一个产品或服务在理想情况下的最大市场规模）可供我们获取。
Ali: 如果我们是在2014年成立公司，比我们实际成立晚一年，那么我们将在2016年经历困难的一年。
Ali: 但到2016年，云计算开始兴起，人工智能也开始兴起。
Ali: 所以我们将在2017年进行修补，但那时就太晚了，可能**超大规模云服务商**（hyperscalers: 提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、Google Cloud）会把它抢走。
Ali: 我们的竞争对手正在抢走它，我们根本没有足够的势头来取得成功。而这就是我们开始的时机。
Ali: 那么，我们是如何把握得如此之好的呢？我们不得不等待马特（Mate）完成他的博士论文。就是这样。

Ben: Yeah, that, you know, that that was the whole thing.

Ben: 是的，你知道，那就是全部。

### 濒临破产：C轮融资的惊险时刻

Ali: So there's a lot of randomness. And you got to get lucky.
Ali: And it was so on the edge as it was that on the **Series C** (C轮融资: 公司发展到一定阶段后进行的第三轮风险投资) , Yan had a handshake with the **Redpoint** (Redpoint Ventures: 一家风险投资公司) with Redpoint, and Redpoint just stopped returning his calls.
Ali: To the point where the Series C was led by us, who also led the **Series A** (A轮融资: 公司发展早期阶段的第一轮正式风险投资), and **NEA** (New Enterprise Associates: 一家风险投资公司), who led the **Series B** (B轮融资: 公司发展中期阶段的第二轮风险投资).
Ali: We co-led the Series C because nobody else would do it. It was that, it was that close to going under, and most companies weren't even right that would be it.

Ali: 所以有很多随机性。你必须走运。
Ali: 而且当时情况危急，以至于在**C轮融资**（Series C: 公司发展到一定阶段后进行的第三轮风险投资）时，彦（Yan）与**Redpoint**（Redpoint Ventures: 一家风险投资公司）达成了口头协议，但Redpoint后来就不再回复他的电话了。
Ali: 到最后，C轮融资是由我们（也主导了**A轮融资**（Series A: 公司发展早期阶段的第一轮正式风险投资））和**NEA**（New Enterprise Associates: 一家风险投资公司）（主导了**B轮融资**（Series B: 公司发展中期阶段的第二轮风险投资））共同牵头的。
Ali: 我们共同主导了C轮融资，因为没有其他人愿意做。当时公司就是那样，离倒闭就差那么一点点，而且大多数公司甚至都不对劲，那就完蛋了。

Ben: Yeah, it was very close because we couldn't get funding for anyone.
Ben: Funding froze up, and nobody wanted to invest anymore. So it was really a lifeline from A16Z.

Ben: 是的，当时非常接近，因为我们无法从任何人那里获得资金。
Ben: 资金冻结了，没有人再想投资了。所以A16Z真的是我们的生命线。

Ali: We were just burning a lot of cash. We weren't generating much revenue other than Spark Summit.

Ali: 我们只是在烧很多钱。除了Spark Summit，我们没有产生多少收入。

Ben: We had a lot of downloads. We had a lot of downloads.

Ben: 我们有很多下载量。我们有很多下载量。

Ali: A lot of downloads and recurring conference revenue.

Ali: 大量的下载量和经常性的会议收入。

Ben: Yeah, and recurring.

Ben: 是的，而且是经常性的。

Host: How confident were you in that time when things were at their level?

Host: 当事情发展到那个程度时，你当时有多大信心？

Ali: Oh, I mean, I seriously considered taking the professor job at Berkeley.
Ali: Because I seriously thought this was going to be very, very hard to pull off.
Ali: I think the sentiment at Databricks was, or at least my sentiment was, "Look, you win some things, you lose some things in life. We created Apache Spark, and we made it a worldwide sensation."
Ali: "Everybody's downloading the downloads are through the roof. We have this greatest conference. Thousands of people come to our conference. It's awesome. Let's go back. Let's do it again. Let's publish another paper and do those kind of things."
Ali: "We're just not business guys. We just don't understand business. That's okay. We don't want to be business guys."
Ali: So that's kind of how I felt about it, right?
Ali: But what I knew was that, by the way, every Mate went back and became a professor. All this stuff happened.

Ali: 哦，我的意思是，我认真考虑过在伯克利大学担任教授。
Ali: 因为我真的觉得这会非常非常难成功。
Ali: 我认为Databricks当时的情绪，或者至少是我的情绪是：“听着，人生有得有失。我们创造了Apache Spark，并让它风靡全球。”
Ali: “每个人都在下载，下载量飙升。我们有这个最棒的会议。成千上万的人来参加我们的会议。太棒了。让我们回去吧。让我们再做一次。让我们再发表一篇论文，做那些事情。”
Ali: “我们只是不擅长商业。我们只是不懂商业。没关系。我们不想成为商业人士。”
Ali: 所以我当时就是这么想的，对吧？
Ali: 但我知道的是，顺便说一句，每个马特（Mate）都回去当教授了。所有这些事情都发生了。

Ben: Yan went back.

Ben: 彦回去了。

Ali: But in 2015, we knew that we had tried everything.
Ali: And by the way, **PLG** (产品主导增长: 一种商业策略，通过产品本身吸引、激活和留住客户) is something that we had tried very hard, and it didn't work for us.
Ali: One of our biggest failures was PLG at Databricks. Everybody kept telling us, "PLG, PLG, PLG."
Ali: And we're like, "Okay, product growth, and Amazon didn't just swipe their credit cards. We don't need sales people."
Ali: So in 2015, I had kind of like...

Ali: 但在2015年，我们知道我们已经尝试了一切。
Ali: 顺便说一句，**产品主导增长**（PLG: 一种商业策略，通过产品本身吸引、激活和留住客户）是我们曾非常努力尝试过的，但它对我们不起作用。
Ali: 我们最大的失败之一就是Databricks的PLG。每个人都一直告诉我们：“PLG，PLG，PLG。”
Ali: 我们当时想：“好吧，产品增长，亚马逊不是直接刷信用卡吗？我们不需要销售人员。”
Ali: 所以在2015年，我有点像……

Ben: Except Cranny.

Ben: 除了克拉尼。

Ali: Exactly. Yes, that is true. Kudos to Mark.
Ali: So that year we had formed some hypothesis that we have nothing to lose.
Ali: What if we just pivoted these things? What if we went all in into B2B enterprise sales?
Ali: Because certainly, PLG is not working. At 3 million **ARR** (年度经常性收入: 企业在一年内从订阅或合同中获得的预测收入), that's not going to take you anywhere.
Ali: And they're just taking our open source software, so we have to have proprietary code around it.
Ali: And yeah, the execs team are all PhDs. So what if we bring in someone that doesn't have a PhD and see how it goes?

Ali: 没错。是的，那是真的。向马克（Mark）致敬。
Ali: 所以那一年我们形成了一些假设，认为我们没有什么可失去的。
Ali: 如果我们只是转变这些事情呢？如果我们全力投入到B2B企业销售中呢？
Ali: 因为很明显，PLG（产品主导增长）行不通。300万美元的**年度经常性收入**（ARR: 企业在一年内从订阅或合同中获得的预测收入），那不会带你到任何地方。
Ali: 而且他们只是在使用我们的开源软件，所以我们必须在周围拥有专有代码。
Ali: 是的，高管团队都是博士。那么如果我们引进一个没有博士学位的人，看看会怎么样呢？

### 突破瓶颈：聘请销售天才Ron Gabrisco

Ben: I never forget Arcelon going, "We made the number." And I was like, "You made a ridiculous number."
Ben: "You made the number. If you keep making that number, you're going to go bankrupt."
Ben: "You didn't make the number. You made a number that you set that was way too low. We haven't figured it out."

Ben: 我永远不会忘记阿塞隆（Arcelon）说：“我们达到了目标。”我当时想：“你达到了一个荒谬的数字。”
Ben: “你达到了目标。如果你继续达到那个数字，你就会破产。”
Ben: “你没有达到目标。你设定的数字太低了。我们还没有弄清楚。”

Ali: Ben was very nice and complimentary in our board meetings that year, 2015.
Ali: We were in a bit of trouble.

Ali: 那一年，2015年，本在我们的董事会议上非常友善和赞扬。
Ali: 我们当时确实有点麻烦。

Ben: Let's say it was very truth-ing.

Ben: 我们可以说当时非常实事求是。

Ali: But yeah, so we had nothing to lose.
Ali: So we didn't know that we were going to succeed, but we had nothing to lose to make those big changes, and we made them in 2016.
Ali: And it turned out those were the bottlenecks. Giving away your software for free, not having execs that have seen the movie before like Ron who came in.
Ali: And the PLG motion is not going to cut it. So maybe we should just try.
Ali: We weren't certain that B2B would work, but we knew that PLG is not working for sure.

Ali: 但，是的，所以我们没有什么可失去的。
Ali: 所以我们不知道我们是否会成功，但我们没有什么可失去的，去做出那些重大改变，我们在2016年做出了它们。
Ali: 结果证明那些是瓶颈。免费提供你的软件，没有像罗恩（Ron）那样有经验的高管加入。
Ali: 而且PLG（产品主导增长）的模式行不通。所以也许我们应该尝试一下。
Ali: 我们不确定B2B是否会奏效，但我们知道PLG肯定行不通。

Ben: Well, another, I mean, we got Ron.
Ben: The fact that the first sales guy we hired was a sales savant, like a genius. Shock. I mean, that never happens.
Ben: And he was a guy we didn't know. Our talent team found him from some company we never heard of.

Ben: 嗯，另一个，我的意思是，我们找到了罗恩（Ron）。
Ben: 我们雇佣的第一个销售人员竟然是个销售奇才，就像个天才一样。震惊。我的意思是，这种事从没发生过。
- 而且他是一个我们不认识的人。我们的人才团队是从一家我们从未听说过的公司找到他的。

Ali: French company. And the only reason we hired him was because he was the only guy Cranny ever liked.
Ali: In all the sales guys he ever interviewed, he was like, "This is the guy."

Ali: 一家法国公司。我们雇佣他的唯一原因是因为他是克拉尼（Cranny）唯一喜欢的人。
Ali: 在他面试过的所有销售人员中，他都说：“就是这个人。”

Host: Wow.

Host: 哇。

Ben: And yeah, he is a new generation more cr, but we just stumbled into him.

Ben: 是的，他是一个新一代的、更……，但我们只是偶然发现了它。

Ali: Yeah. Like unbelievable. And without Ron, very hard to see us this company getting to where it got to.
Ali: So there's some luck involved in us even finding him. But then that he was phenomenal.
Ali: And also kudos to Yan, who actually led the search in 2015.
Ali: But yeah, Ron was game changing for us. But Ron was a very uncomfortable hire.

Ali: 是的。简直难以置信。如果没有罗恩，很难想象我们公司能发展到今天这个地步。
Ali: 所以我们能找到他也有一些运气成分。但他确实非常出色。
Ali: 还要赞扬彦，他在2015年实际上主导了这次招聘。
Ali: 但，是的，罗恩对我们来说是改变游戏规则的人物。但罗恩是一个非常不舒服的招聘。

Ben: Because he did not have a PhD.

Ben: 因为他没有博士学位。

Ali: He did have an engineering degree. He does have an engineering degree from Stanford. That helped a little bit.
Ali: But he's a sales, true and true sales guy. He's not one of these, he's a classic sales person, who grew up in sales, even though he has an engineering degree.
Ali: So the comfortable thing would have been to pick someone, and we had some candidates in the mix who were super technical, using the product, giving us feedback.
Ali: But they probably would not, and that would have been much more comfortable for us.

Ali: 他确实拥有工程学学位。他确实拥有斯坦福大学的工程学学位。那有点帮助。
Ali: 但他是一个真正的销售人员，地地道道的销售人员。他不是那种，他是一个经典的销售人员，是在销售行业成长起来的，尽管他拥有工程学学位。
Ali: 所以，更舒服的做法是选择一个，我们有一些候选人，他们非常技术化，使用产品，给我们反馈。
Ali: 但他们可能不会成功，而对我们来说，那会舒服得多。

Ben: Yeah.

Ben: 是的。

Ali: Yeah, Ron was uncomfortable. He was a very uncomfortable hire, and he made it very uncomfortable for us for many years, and he still does.

Ali: 是的，罗恩让人不舒服。他是一个非常令人不舒服的雇佣，而且他在很多年里都让我们感到非常不舒服，现在也一样。

Ben: But that's a lot of the key to the company.

Ben: 但那也是公司成功的关键之一。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

Ben: It forces a customer focus that would be impossible to have without somebody that smart and crafty about getting his way. I mean, just unbelievable.

Ben: 它迫使公司以客户为中心，如果没有像他那样聪明且狡猾的人来达成目标，这是不可能实现的。我的意思是，简直难以置信。

Ali: Yeah.

Ali: 是的。

### 联合创始人的持久贡献

Ali: If you can keep also the original team together, that's important. We were seven co-founders still.
Ali: Many of the co-founders, you said data warehousing was a big push for us. My co-founder Rainald was really the one that kind of pushed this.

Ali: 如果你也能让最初的团队保持团结，那也很重要。我们仍然是七位联合创始人。
Ali: 许多联合创始人，你说数据仓库对我们来说是一个很大的推动力。我的联合创始人雷诺（Rainald）才是真正推动这件事的人。

Ben: The contribution level from a large number of co-founders is unique in the industry.
Ben: You've got Patrick, you have Rainald, you have Mate, you have Arcelon.
Ben: It's crazy how much the original team contributes.

Ben: 如此多的联合创始人的贡献水平在行业中是独一无二的。
Ben: 你有帕特里克（Patrick），你有雷诺（Rainald），你有马特（Mate），你有阿塞隆（Arcelon）。
Ben: 最初的团队贡献之大简直令人难以置信。

Ali: Yeah. So the PhDs all contribute. Arcelon really made the go-to-market work, and he really made the sort of Ron work with the rest of the company.
Ali: That was super critical. Mate continued doing lots of innovations over the years.
Ali: Patrick led all of engineering in big chunks of it.
Ali: And we've had other people, we've been lucky to get such folks. So hiring is critical and keeping the original talent. I think those were some of the things.

Ali: 是的。所以所有的博士都做出了贡献。阿塞隆（Arcelon）真正地让进入市场策略奏效，他真正地让罗恩（Ron）与公司的其他人合作。
Ali: 那是非常关键的。马特（Mate）多年来持续进行大量创新。
Ali: 帕特里克（Patrick）领导了大部分的工程部门。
Ali: 我们还有其他人，我们很幸运能得到这些人。所以招聘和留住原始人才至关重要。我认为这些都是其中一些方面。

Ben: Usually founders, usually only one of the co-founders contributes long term.
Ben: So to have that going, and Yan's still on the board, and Scott's still on the board. I mean, it's very unusual.

Ben: 通常创始人，通常只有一个联合创始人能长期贡献。
Ben: 所以能有这样的情况，而且彦（Yan）仍然在董事会，斯科特（Scott）也仍然在董事会。我的意思是，这非常不寻常。

Host: Yeah, we have a lot more we can get into, but we're at time, so we'll leave it for future episodes of Boss Talk. But this is a great first episode.

Host: 是的，我们还有很多可以深入探讨的，但时间到了，所以我们将其留到未来的Boss Talk节目中。但这确实是很棒的第一集。

Ali: All right, that was fun. Thanks so much.

Ali: 好的，很开心。非常感谢。

Host: Thank you so much, guys.

Host: 谢谢你们，各位。
