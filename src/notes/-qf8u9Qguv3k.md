### 彭博社介绍与市长巴斯的回应

Bloomberg: You're listening to Bloomberg BusinessWeek with Carol Masser and Tim Stenc on Bloomberg radio. We are in the heart of Hollywood, live at **Bloomberg Screen Time** (Bloomberg Screen Time: 彭博社的现场活动). We're speaking to the mogul, celebrities, entrepreneurs, the leaders defining the next phase of pop culture. One of those leaders joins us now, Rick Caruso. He's the billionaire real estate developer, the former candidate for mayor of LA. He's the founder and executive chairman of **Caruso** (Caruso: 美国最大的私人房地产公司之一). It's one of the largest privately held real estate companies in the US. He's a philanthropist. He's going to be here on stage a little bit later for a conversation with our LA bureau chief, John Gdson. He joins us now ahead of that conversation. Rick, welcome back to Bloomberg Business Week. It's been a bit since we last spoke to you. We got to start with what LA Mayor Bass said last night here. She spoke with Sarah McGregor, managing editor, national desk at Bloomberg. Here she is last night at screen time. Rick Caruso, who you defeated in 2022 in the mayor's race, has been one of your most vocal critics around the fires. He released a statement today after the arrest, saying it shows the disaster was preventable and in his words calling it a failure of government on an epic level, starting with Mayor Bass. He'll be with us on this stage tomorrow.

彭博社：您正在收听彭博商业周刊，由卡罗尔·马塞尔和蒂姆·斯滕克在彭博电台为您播出。我们正在好莱坞中心，在**彭博荧屏时间**（Bloomberg Screen Time：彭博社的现场活动）进行现场直播。我们正在与那些定义流行文化下一阶段的巨头、名人、企业家和领导者对话。其中一位领导者——里克·卡鲁索——现在加入了我们。他是一位亿万富翁房地产开发商，曾是洛杉矶市长候选人。他是**卡鲁索**（Caruso：美国最大的私人房地产公司之一）的创始人兼执行主席。卡鲁索是美国最大的私人房地产公司之一。他也是一位慈善家。他稍后将与我们的洛杉矶分社社长约翰·格德森进行一场对话。他现在提前加入了我们。里克，欢迎回到彭博商业周刊。我们上次与您交谈已有一段时间了。我们必须从洛杉矶市长巴斯昨晚在这里说的话开始。她与彭博社国家新闻部执行主编莎拉·麦格雷戈进行了交谈。她昨晚在荧屏时间的发言如下。里克·卡鲁索，您在2022年的市长竞选中击败了他，他一直是对火灾问题最直言不讳的批评者之一。他在逮捕事件后今天发表声明，称这表明这场灾难是可以预防的，并用他的话说，称其为“史诗级的政府失败，始于市长巴斯”。他明天将与我们同台。

LA Mayor Karen Bass: How do you respond to that? Well, the way he characterized me sounded like Trump, but I was just saddened by it honestly because I think that response was beneath him. We actually he was in my office a couple of weeks ago. We're working on something. We're working on a couple of things together. But I think that he is sad and bitter and I think that it is really sad to exploit. I feel like it's exploiting tragedy. It's exploiting grief.

洛杉矶市长凯伦·巴斯：您对此有何回应？嗯，他形容我的方式听起来像特朗普，但我坦白说对此感到悲哀，因为我认为这种回应有失他的身份。实际上，几周前他还在我的办公室里。我们正在合作一些事情。我们正在一起做几件事。但我认为他感到悲伤和痛苦，而且我认为利用这种悲剧真的令人难过。我觉得这是在利用悲剧，是在利用悲痛。

### 卡鲁索对市长批评的回应

Bloomberg: Well, there you have it. That was LA Mayor Karen Bass last night here at Bloomberg Screen Time. Rick Caruso joins us now. Rick, your turn to respond to criticism of your criticism from the LA Mayor. What do you make of it?

彭博社：好的，这就是洛杉矶市长凯伦·巴斯昨晚在彭博荧屏时间的发言。里克·卡鲁索现在加入了我们。里克，现在轮到您回应洛杉矶市长对您的批评的批评了。您对此有何看法？

Rick Caruso: Listen, I said what I think so many people around Los Angeles, throughout LA, and this whole region feel, especially after reading the **afteraction report** (afteraction report: 针对特定事件发生后，评估应对措施、识别问题并提出改进建议的报告). I don't know if any of you have read it, but it's very clear that this fire was preventable. And it's very clear that they didn't have a plan to do anything about it because if she had a plan, she would have responded in that question by saying this is the plan I had and we did our best to implement it. But I, you know, going forward, we've got to solve these problems because when you read that afteraction report, glaring failures, systematic failures of our system, our city are outlined in there. And there's solutions to all of them. And, you know, the focus has got to be making sure this kind of thing doesn't happen again. But I'm not going to dwell on the fact that the city failed because, it's in black and white now and very clear.

里克·卡鲁索：听着，我说出了我认为洛杉矶各地乃至整个地区许多人的感受，尤其是在阅读了这份**事后行动报告**（afteraction report：针对特定事件发生后，评估应对措施、识别问题并提出改进建议的报告）之后。我不知道你们是否有人读过，但这份报告非常清楚地表明，这场火灾是可以预防的。而且很明显，他们没有一个应对计划，因为如果她有计划，她会在回答那个问题时说：“这是我原有的计划，我们尽力去实施了。”但是，你知道，展望未来，我们必须解决这些问题，因为当你阅读那份事后行动报告时，我们城市系统的明显失误、系统性失败都清晰地列在其中。所有这些问题都有解决方案。而且，重点必须是确保这类事情不再发生。但我不会纠结于城市失败的事实，因为现在白纸黑字写得清清楚楚。

### 政治的本质与公共服务

Bloomberg: Well, Rick, just to follow, Mayor Bass said that you guys were together just recently working together on things. So, I'm just curious, conversations sometimes are things we hear in public versus things we hear behind the scenes. I mean, one of the things we got from Mayor Bass is talking about members of the Trump administration that certainly LA, California in general have clashed with, but that she talks to them on a regular basis, people she knew from her time in DC. So, I'm just curious, what are the conversations or what can you share with us about maybe the constructive conversations you're having with Mayor Bass behind the scenes about what happened, what can be done better going forward?

彭博社：里克，我想追问一下，巴斯市长说你们最近还在一起合作一些事情。所以我很好奇，有些对话是我们在公开场合听到的，有些则是我们在幕后听到的。我的意思是，我们从巴斯市长那里得到的一点是，她谈到特朗普政府的一些成员，洛杉矶乃至整个加州当然都与他们有过冲突，但她会定期与他们交谈，这些人是她在华盛顿特区任职时认识的。所以，我很好奇，您能和我们分享一下您与巴斯市长在幕后进行的建设性对话吗？关于发生了什么，以及未来如何做得更好？

Rick Caruso: Yeah. Well, here's something that's really important that she said. In the next question, she said politics is performative, and they would go out, beat each other up and then go have dinner. Something like that that she talked about. I don't think politics is performative. I think what we learned from this fire is that leadership matters. That these positions, when you're the head of a city, the head of a state, in any kind of very important elected office, you actually impact lives and it's not about putting on a show. It's actually about making a difference in people's lives every day. So, I was really stunned by her statement and listen, I have met with her. My job through **Steadfast** (Steadfast: 卡鲁索发起的一项旨在帮助灾后重建的倡议), we are working very hard with the city, with the county, with the state to get people back in their homes quickly and safely, get these neighborhoods rebuilt. And so we have a number of initiatives that we have delivered to the city to help them do their job better and quicker. And I have met with her and I will work with anybody to help rebuild Altadena, Malibu and the Palisades and do that with great honesty, great dedication because that is the mission right now is to get people's lives rebuilt that have been shattered. But it's not performative. It's real and it's also real in my criticism because that criticism is factually true. And I think what we need to be doing is spending a lot of time like I just said, going through that afteraction report, asking some really tough questions. How could this have happened and what are the solutions so it never happens again? Whether it's a fire or an earthquake or a flood or whatever may be, it clearly points out that there wasn't a plan and the system failed and a community burnt down and 11 people died. Let's not forget about that. So, you know, are there tens and tens of thousands of people who are sad and angry? There sure are. And yesterday after that announcement came out, it re-triggered a lot of emotions in a lot of people. And I stand with them. I understand it because of the losses that we incurred that my daughter lost her house, my son lost his house. And that emotion is a true raw emotion. It's important to recognize and it's frankly important to sympathize and be compassionate about because people are really hurting. I'm fortunate we have a number of options, but the far majority of the people that lost their homes or lost their jobs, they don't have options and they need help and help quickly. And that's what we're doing at Steadfast is making a real difference in people's lives. And I'm proud of that.

里克·卡鲁索：是的。她说的有一点非常重要。在下一个问题中，她说政治是表演性的，他们会出去互相攻击，然后一起共进晚餐。她谈到了类似这样的话。我不认为政治是表演性的。我认为我们从这场火灾中学到的是，领导力至关重要。这些职位，当你是一个城市的领导者，一个州的领导者，在任何重要的民选职位上，你实际上都在影响着人们的生活，这与作秀无关。它实际上是关于每天都在人们的生活中带来改变。所以，我对她的声明感到非常震惊。听着，我确实和她见过面。我通过**坚韧倡议**（Steadfast：卡鲁索发起的一项旨在帮助灾后重建的倡议）的工作，正与市、县、州政府非常努力地合作，让人们迅速安全地回到自己的家园，重建这些社区。因此，我们向市政府提出了许多倡议，帮助他们更好更快地完成工作。我与她见过面，我愿意与任何人合作，帮助重建阿塔迪纳、马里布和太平洋帕利塞德，并以极大的诚实和奉献精神去做，因为现在的使命就是重建那些被摧毁的人们的生活。但这并非表演。它是真实的，我的批评也是真实的，因为那些批评是事实。我认为我们现在需要做的是，像我刚才说的，花大量时间仔细研究那份事后行动报告，提出一些非常尖锐的问题：这怎么会发生？以及有哪些解决方案能确保它不再发生？无论是火灾、地震还是洪水，或者其他任何灾害，它都清楚地指出没有计划，系统失灵，一个社区被烧毁，11人丧生。我们不能忘记这一点。所以，你知道，是否有成千上万的人感到悲伤和愤怒？当然有。昨天，在那个声明发布之后，它再次触动了许多人的情感。我支持他们。我理解这种情绪，因为我们遭受了损失，我的女儿失去了房子，我的儿子也失去了房子。那种情感是一种真实而原始的情感。承认它很重要，坦率地说，同情和富有怜悯之心也很重要，因为人们真的在痛苦。我很幸运我们有很多选择，但绝大多数失去家园或工作的人，他们没有选择，他们需要帮助，而且是迅速的帮助。这正是我们在“坚韧倡议”中所做的，我们正在真正改变人们的生活。我为此感到自豪。

### 政治抱负与公共服务理念

Bloomberg: Well, Rick, last time you were on with us, it was just over a month ago, you said you were still deciding whether or not you were going to run for mayor or for governor. Have you made up your mind yet?

彭博社：里克，上次您和我们在一起，那是在一个多月前，您说您还在决定是否要竞选市长或州长。您现在决定了吗？

Rick Caruso: I don't like this guy. No, but I'm working hard at it. I've been spending a lot of time going across the state. I was in San Francisco last night at a great dinner with a bunch of tech executives and entrepreneurs and I was in Bakersfield and I've been all over the place. So, I'm doing what I want to do, meaning I'm on this tour of the state and the city. I'm meeting people. I'm listening to people. I'm understanding what the issues are. Developing policies where we can make a big difference whether it's the city or the state and at the right time I'll make my decision and I'll announce it and you guys will be one of the first to know.

里克·卡鲁索：我不喜欢这个人。不，但我正在为此努力。我花了很多时间在全州各地奔波。昨晚我在旧金山与一群科技公司高管和企业家共进晚餐，那是一次很棒的晚餐。我还去了贝克斯菲尔德，我去了很多地方。所以，我正在做我想做的事情，这意味着我正在进行全州和全市的巡访。我正在与人见面，倾听民意，了解问题所在。我正在制定政策，无论是在市级还是州级，我们都能带来巨大改变。时机成熟时，我会做出决定并宣布，你们将是第一批知道的人。

Bloomberg: Thank you. We are talking with Rick Caruso, founder and executive chair of Caruso. Wait, having said that, you know, I'm not going to let this go completely. You said you're in San Francisco talking to tech executives. You're in Bakersfield. You're all over the place. You're in LA right now. That sounds to me like a broader scope. So, are you leaning maybe towards being governor versus mayor? I'm just curious. Are you leaning a little bit?

彭博社：谢谢。我们正在与卡鲁索公司的创始人兼执行主席里克·卡鲁索交谈。等等，话虽如此，我不会就此罢休。您说您在旧金山与科技公司高管交谈，您在贝克斯菲尔德，您到处奔波。您现在在洛杉矶。这听起来像是一个更广阔的范围。那么，您是否更倾向于竞选州长而不是市长？我只是好奇。您是否有点倾向？

Rick Caruso: That is a great followup. I love you. But I am keeping both options very open. I have two different teams. I have two different teams that are working on both and both are really important positions and I want to do my best to end up in a position where I could do the greatest good to make a difference in people's lives and that that is my motivation. It's not a career move for me. It's really to give back like I've done before, working with three different mayors. And you know, your LA lead guy, John, who just wrote the article about me, you know, there was a great statement in there that three mayors turned to me to help with critical problems that needed to be fixed at the time. And I was honored to be able to do that. So, to me, that's what public service is all about is having the trust of people and really making a difference in people's lives. And I'll let you know where I end up when I make a decision.

里克·卡鲁索：这是一个很好的追问。我很喜欢你。但我对这两个选择都持非常开放的态度。我有两个不同的团队，他们都在为这两个方向努力。这两个都是非常重要的职位，我希望尽力最终能在一个能为人们生活带来最大改变的职位上，这就是我的动力。对我来说，这不是一个职业发展。这真的是为了回馈社会，就像我以前做的那样，曾与三位不同的市长合作。你知道，你们洛杉矶的首席记者约翰，他刚刚写了一篇关于我的文章，里面有一个很棒的说法，就是三位市长都曾向我求助，解决当时需要解决的关键问题。我很荣幸能够做到这一点。所以，对我来说，公共服务就是关于赢得人们的信任，并真正改变人们的生活。当我做出决定时，我会告诉你们我的选择。

### 拯救加州的电影产业

Bloomberg: Well, John Gdson is going to be speaking with you on stage here at Screen Time just a little later. If you have not yet seen that story in Bloomberg BusinessWeek, check it out at bloomberg.com and on the Bloomberg terminal as well. I want to talk a little bit about Hollywood and what you think the fix is here. As we know, the film industry has been under tremendous pressure. COVID, the fires, technological disruption. What is the right fix?

彭博社：约翰·格德森稍后将在荧屏时间与您同台对话。如果您还没有看过彭博商业周刊上的那篇文章，请在bloomberg.com和彭博终端上查看。我想聊聊好莱坞，以及您认为这里的解决方案是什么。我们知道，电影行业一直面临着巨大的压力。新冠疫情、火灾、技术颠覆。正确的解决方案是什么？

Rick Caruso: We've got to be competitive with Atlanta. We got to be competitive with New Jersey. We've got to save the film industry. You know, people that are **below the line** (below the line: 电影制作中指非创意核心部门的员工，如技术人员、剧组工人等) are just getting destroyed. You know, the florists, the drivers, all of the people that support the entertainment industry. There's an arrogance, I think, in our leadership that the entertainment industry was born here, it's going to stay here. That's just not dealing with reality. And this is where I think leadership and executive skills really matter. Identify a problem and solve it. If we're the fourth largest economy as a state in the world, let's act like it. And let's give the resources to keep the entertainment industry in California and in Los Angeles. And we've got to be competitive and not allow and force people quite frankly to go to London. Like I said, New Jersey. I mean, the mayor of New Jersey, Phil, did a hell of a job getting Netflix, gave a lot of money to build a studio there, and that's a sucking sound of jobs coming out of California. So, I would reverse that course immediately so that we're competitive and keep people in our state.

里克·卡鲁索：我们必须与亚特兰大竞争。我们必须与新泽西竞争。我们必须拯救电影产业。你知道，那些**一线以下**（below the line：电影制作中指非创意核心部门的员工，如技术人员、剧组工人等）的人正在被摧毁。你知道，花商、司机，所有支持娱乐产业的人。我认为我们的领导层有一种傲慢，认为娱乐业诞生于此，就会留在这里。那根本不是在面对现实。这就是我认为领导力和执行能力真正重要的地方。发现问题并解决它。如果我们的州是世界第四大经济体，那我们就要表现得像个样子。我们应该提供资源，把娱乐产业留在加州和洛杉矶。我们必须有竞争力，坦率地说，不能允许并强迫人们去伦敦。就像我说的，新泽西。我的意思是，新泽西市长菲尔在争取Netflix方面做得非常出色，提供了大量资金在那里建造一个工作室，这导致了加州就业机会的流失。所以，我会立即扭转这种局面，让我们保持竞争力，把人们留在我们的州。

Bloomberg: 20 seconds very quickly. Do you think a tariff on movies made outside the United States makes sense? And forgive me really quickly.

彭博社：20秒，非常迅速。您认为对在美国境外制作的电影征收关税有意义吗？请原谅我问得这么快。

Rick Caruso: No, no. Let's just be competitive and let's not be punitive, okay? And if we can't win the industry by being competitive, shame on us. I think we can.

里克·卡鲁索：不，不。我们只需保持竞争力，不要采取惩罚性措施，好吗？如果通过竞争力我们无法赢得这个行业，那我们自己就该感到羞愧。我相信我们能做到。

Bloomberg: All right, Rick. You know where to find us when you're ready to announce.

彭博社：好的，里克。当您准备好宣布时，您知道在哪里能找到我们。
