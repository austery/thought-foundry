这是股市动态报告的收盘钟声。美股交易收盘时，做出变动的公司有 Carol Masser、Tim Stenbec、Roma Bostik 和 Scarlett Fu。

The
 S&P
 500
 decidedly
 in
 record
 territory
 6753
 and
 change
 as
 we
 wait
 for
 these
 numbers
 to
 settle
 up
 about
 39
 points
 or
 610
 of
 1%.
 The
 Nasdaq
 Composite
 adding
 more
 than
 200
 points
 or
 a
 percent
 on
 the
 day
 a
 300
 point
 gain
 for
 the
 Nasdaq
 100
 a
 percent
 on
 the
 day
 both
 at
 record
 highs.
 Looks
 like
 the
 Dow
 Jones
 Industrial
 Average
 is
 going
 to
 close
 basically
 unchanged
 on
 the
 day
 and
 the
 Russell
 2000
 participating
 in
 the
 action
 as
 well.
 a
 gain
 of
 about
 26
 points
 here
 on
 the
 day,
 1%
 and
 just
 about
 four
 points
 shy
 of
 its
 most
 recent
 record
 high.

标准普尔 500 指数明确处于创纪录的 6753 点区域，我们等待这些数字尘埃落定，上涨约 39 点，或 0.610%。纳斯达克综合指数当天上涨超过 200 点，或 1%。纳斯达克 100 指数当天上涨 300 点，或 1%，均创下历史新高。道琼斯工业平均指数当天基本持平，罗素 2000 指数也参与了此次行情，当天上涨约 26 点，或 1%，距离其最近的纪录高点仅差约 4 点。

And
 digging
 a
 bit
 deeper
 into
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 landed
 here,
 particularly
 in
 the
 S&P
 500,
 we've
 got
 about
 263
 that
 settled
 up
 in
 the
 green,
 237
 down
 here,
 only
 three
 unchanged.

深入了解一下这些股票的表现，特别是在标准普尔 500 指数中，有约 263 只股票收盘上涨，237 只下跌，只有三只持平。

All
 right,
 it's
 circle
 time.
 Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 sectors
 right
 now.
 More
 thisoro
 or
 what
 is
 it?
 Orus.
 It's
 a
 snake
 that
 eats
 itself.
 Not
 well
 maybe
 it
 is
 what
 you're
 seeing
 today
 at
 least
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 tech
 sector
 but
 that's
 what's
 outperforming
 uh
 tech
 up
 1
 and
 a
 half%
 what
 is
 aobuko
 is
 that
 something
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 meat
 and
 like
 maybe
 eating
 the
 marrow
 out
 of
 a
 bone
 but
 uh
 industrials
 also
 had
 a
 great
 day
 remain
 your
 second
 best
 performing
 sector
 on
 the
 day
 what
 didn't
 do
 too
 hot
 financials
 that
 was
 your
 biggest
 loss
 leader
 at
 least
 from
 a
 points
 basis
 we
 know
 that
 big
 bank
 earnings
 kickoff
 pretty
 soon
 consumer
 staples
 energy
 and
 real
 estate
 also
 falling
 a
 And
 we
 just
 heard
 from
 Betsy
 Grace
 over
 at
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 She's
 actually
 pretty
 bullish
 about
 this
 earning
 season
 for
 banks.
 Yeah,
 big
 time.
 For
 big
 time.
 She
 told
 us
 to
 buckle
 up.
 She
 did.
 I'm
 buckled.

好了，该轮到我们了。现在来看看板块。是“thisoro”还是“Orus”？就像一条蛇在吞噬自己。今天似乎并非如此，至少在科技板块是这样，它表现最好，上涨了 1.5%。我猜“aobuko”可能与肉有关，或者像是在啃食骨髓？但工业板块今天也表现出色，仍然是今天表现第二好的板块。表现不佳的是金融板块，至少从点数上看，它是最大的下跌板块。我们知道大型银行的财报季很快就要开始了。消费必需品、能源和房地产板块也下跌了。我们刚听到了来自摩根士丹利的 Betsy Grace 的看法。她对银行的这个财报季相当看好。是的，非常看好。她让我们系好安全带。她说了，我已经系好了。

### 热门上涨股

Well,
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 gainers
 that
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 A
 few
 of
 them
 to
 look
 at.
 A
 Space
 Mobile.
 This
 is
 a
 company
 that
 really
 spends
 a
 lot
 of
 its
 time
 in
 space.
 It
 actually
 has
 a
 strong
 competition
 here
 with
 SpaceX,
 their
 Starlink
 there.
 So,
 we
 did
 see
 shares
 climbing
 earlier
 for
 double
 digit
 gains,
 but
 closing
 about
 8%
 higher
 at
 the
 closing
 bell.
 This
 is
 after
 the
 company
 signed
 an
 agreement
 with
 Verizon
 here
 to
 provide
 direct
 to
 cellular
 connectivity
 when
 needed
 for
 customers
 starting
 next
 year.
 So,
 we
 had
 William
 Blair
 saying
 that
 this
 is
 really
 a
 competitive
 deal
 here
 for
 Verizon,
 specifically
 over
 SpaceX's
 Starlink
 here.
 So,
 one
 to
 definitely
 follow.
 But
 of
 course,
 as
 we've
 been
 talking
 so
 much
 about
 AI,
 we
 cannot
 stop
 talking
 about
 that
 story
 here.
 Shares
 of
 AMD
 also
 in
 focus,
 up
 11%
 today.
 I
 mean,
 this
 has
 been
 a
 company
 that
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 quite
 some
 time
 as
 you
 think
 about
 it
 with
 the
 likes
 of
 Nvidia
 and
 a
 few
 of
 its
 other
 peers.
 But
 the
 news
 today,
 of
 course,
 Nvidia
 agreeing
 to
 invest
 as
 much
 as
 hundred
 billion
 dollars
 in
 OpenAI
 to
 fund
 a
 data
 center
 buildout.
 Uh
 so
 of
 course
 that's
 really
 the
 broader
 scope
 here,
 but
 this
 uh
 Open
 AI
 is
 striking
 a
 deal
 with
 Nvidia
 rival
 AMD
 to
 deploy
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 worth
 of
 chips
 here.
 Open
 AI
 is
 poised
 to
 become
 one
 of
 AMD's
 largest
 shareholders
 really
 seeing
 a
 buoy
 to
 the
 sock
 here.
 And
 lastly,
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 beauty
 space
 and
 looking
 at
 shares
 of
 E.L.F.
 Beauty
 right
 now.
 Shares
 ended
 about
 3%
 higher
 at
 the
 closing
 bell.
 It
 actually
 got
 a
 price
 target
 lift
 at
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 The
 analyst
 over
 there
 is
 really
 pointing
 toward
 a
 very
 strong
 launch
 for
 its
 road
 brand
 at
 Sephora.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 guys
 are
 familiar.
 That's
 uh
 Haley
 Bieber.
 Her
 makeup
 brand
 is
 called
 Road.
 Apparently,
 they
 had
 a
 very
 strong
 launch
 at
 the
 Sephora
 stores
 here.
 So,
 you
 are
 seeing
 a
 lift
 as
 Morgan
 Stanley
 is
 pushing
 their
 price
 target
 up
 to
 a
 street
 high.

我们来看看标准普尔 500 指数中的一些上涨股。有几家值得关注。AST Spacemobile。这家公司大部分时间都在太空领域。它面临着 SpaceX 及其 Starlink 的激烈竞争。因此，我们看到其股价早盘大幅上涨，收盘时上涨了约 8%。这是因为该公司与 Verizon 签署了一项协议，从明年开始为客户在需要时提供直接蜂窝连接。William Blair 表示，这笔交易对 Verizon 来说非常有竞争力，尤其是在 SpaceX 的 Starlink 面前。这确实值得关注。当然，正如我们一直以来对人工智能的讨论，我们无法停止谈论这个话题。AMD 的股价也备受关注，今天上涨了 11%。我们已经讨论 AMD 相当长一段时间了，将其与英伟达等同行进行比较。但今天的新闻是，英伟达同意向 OpenAI 投资高达 1000 亿美元，为数据中心建设提供资金。所以，当然，这是更广泛的背景，但这家 OpenAI 与英伟达的竞争对手 AMD 达成了一项协议，将部署价值数百亿美元的芯片。OpenAI 有望成为 AMD 的最大股东之一，这确实提振了其股价。最后，让我们看看美容行业，目前来看 E.L.F. Beauty 的股价。收盘时上涨了约 3%。摩根士丹利提高了其目标价。那里的分析师实际上指出，其与 Sephora 合作推出的 Road 品牌取得了非常强劲的开局。不知道你们是否熟悉。那是海莉·比伯。她的美妆品牌叫做 Road。据报道，他们在丝芙兰门店的推出非常成功。因此，由于摩根士丹利将其目标价推至市场最高水平，我们看到了股价上涨。

We're
 actually
 well
 verssed
 in
 makeup
 over
 here.
 We
 are.
 We
 are.
 We
 are.
 Yeah.

我们在这方面（美妆）其实很了解。是的，我们很了解。是的。

All
 right.
 Decliners,
 what's
 up?
 Well,
 it's
 green
 and
 it's
 green,
 Katie.
 But
 there
 are
 a
 few
 stocks
 that
 fell
 today.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 Fair
 Isaac.
 You
 and
 I
 probably
 know
 that
 more
 commonly
 as
 FICO
 and
 it's
 falling
 not
 because
 of
 news
 specific
 to
 FICO
 itself,
 but
 because
 of
 news
 from
 its
 competitor
 Equifax
 saying
 that
 it
 will
 offer
 its
 Vantage
 Score
 4.0
 service
 to
 mortgage
 uh
 credit
 scores
 at
 $4.50
 through
 the
 end
 of
 2027.
 Remember
 last
 week
 FICO
 said
 it
 will
 sell
 credit
 scores
 directly
 to
 mortgage
 resellers
 and
 Equifax
 saying
 that
 its
 move
 is
 a
 direct
 response
 to
 what
 FICO
 is
 doing
 there.
 So
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 tussle
 between
 credit
 score
 providers.
 Very
 interesting
 space
 there.
 Uh
 but
 certainly
 FICO
 taking
 the
 brunt
 of
 that
 pain
 from
 that
 news
 today.
 Another
 decliner
 that
 I
 want
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 today
 is
 of
 course
 Warner
 Brothers.
 Uh
 those
 shares
 down
 after
 we
 did
 get
 news
 people
 familiar
 saying
 that
 Paramount
 Sky
 Dance
 has
 discussed
 its
 interest
 and
 according
 to
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery
 with
 Legendary
 Entertainment
 and
 Apollo
 Global
 Management.
 Now
 the
 talks
 seem
 to
 be
 related
 specifically
 to
 Legendar's
 investment
 in
 some
 key
 film
 franchises.
 Ever
 heard
 of
 Dune
 or
 Godzilla?
 So
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the
 assets
 that
 are
 potentially
 being
 discussed
 here.
 And
 the
 bottom
 line
 is
 this
 looks
 like
 is
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 another
 delay
 to
 this
 potential
 acquisition.
 They
 were
 hoping
 to
 get
 this
 done
 before
 the
 Warner
 Brothers
 split
 in
 early
 2026,
 but
 another
 roadblock.

好了，下跌的股票，怎么回事？嗯，大部分是绿色的，凯蒂。但今天有几只股票下跌了。其中之一是 Fair Isaac。你和我可能更熟悉它的名字 FICO。它下跌不是因为 FICO 本身的消息，而是因为其竞争对手 Equifax 的消息。Equifax 表示，将以 4.50 美元的价格提供其 Vantage Score 4.0 服务用于抵押贷款信用评分，直至 2027 年底。还记得上周 FICO 表示将直接向抵押贷款经销商出售信用评分，而 Equifax 表示此举是对 FICO 行为的直接回应。因此，信用评分提供商之间存在一些争执。这是一个非常有趣的领域。但今天 FICO 确实承受了这方面消息的重创。今天我还要关注的另一个下跌股票是华纳兄弟。在得到知情人士的消息后，其股价下跌，该消息称派拉蒙环球（Sky Dance）已与其潜在收购方华纳兄弟探索公司（Warner Brothers Discovery）、传奇影业（Legendary Entertainment）和阿波罗全球管理公司（Apollo Global Management）进行了讨论。现在，这些谈判似乎与传奇影业在一些关键电影系列中的投资有关。你听说过《沙丘》或《哥斯拉》吗？这些是可能正在讨论的一些资产。底线是，这看起来将是这次潜在收购的又一次延迟。他们原本希望在 2026 年初华纳兄弟分拆之前完成这笔交易，但又出现了一个障碍。

And
 have
 you
 actually
 seen
 Dune,
 Christine?
 I
 saw
 it
 in
 theaters.
 Oh,
 really?
 You
 liked
 it?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 interesting.
 Uh,
 yeah.
 I
 I
 It's
 not
 my
 cup
 of
 tea
 necessarily.
 So,
 would
 it
 watch
 it
 again?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 watch
 it
 again.
 I
 may
 have
 fallen
 asleep
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 it.
 Oh,
 I
 actually
 did
 fall
 asleep
 in
 theaters
 during
 Dune
 2,
 but
 that's
 because
 we
 went
 to
 a
 midnight
 showing
 and
 you
 know
 that's
 a
 young
 man's
 game.
 But
 great
 movie.

你真的看过《沙丘》吗，克里斯汀？我在电影院看的。哦，真的吗？你喜欢吗？我的意思是，很有趣。嗯，是的。我。我。它不一定是我喜欢的类型。那你会再看一遍吗？是的。是的。不，我不会再看了。我可能在中间睡着了。哦，我在电影院看《沙丘 2》时确实睡着了，但那是因为我们去看的是午夜场，你知道，那是年轻人的游戏。但这是部很棒的电影。

Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 Yeah.
 How
 about
 that
 bond
 market,
 though?
 Yeah.
 How
 about
 that
 bond
 market?
 Well,
 not
 a
 whole
 lot.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 heard
 Katie
 Griffel,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 tail
 on
 the
 most
 recent
 10-year
 auction
 here.
 Actually,
 in
 all
 seriousness
 though,
 you
 not
 really
 seeing
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 activity.
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 activity
 on
 the
 longer
 end
 of
 the
 curve,
 but
 that
 was
 mostly
 selling,
 pushing
 yields
 higher
 by
 about
 two
 basis
 points.
 A
 very,
 very
 modest
 bid
 on
 the
 long
 end
 of
 the
 curve
 with
 that
 30-year
 yield
 uh
 just
 down
 less
 than
 a
 basis
 point.

好吧，看吧。是的。那债券市场呢？是的。那债券市场呢？嗯，没什么大动静。我的意思是，我不知道你是否听说了，凯蒂·格里芬，但最近一次 10 年期国债拍卖有些滞后。说实话，你并没有看到太多活动。在收益率曲线的长期端有一些活动，但那主要是抛售，将收益率推高约两个基点。收益率曲线长期端的投标非常非常温和，30 年期国债收益率仅下跌不到一个基点。
