### AI泡沫：与2000年互联网泡沫的对比

我们是否正处于一场AI泡沫之中？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Are we in an AI bubble?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker表示，他认为我们今天并未处于AI泡沫之中。他曾有幸（或不幸，取决于如何看待）在2000年泡沫期间担任科技投资者，那实际上是一场电信泡沫。他认为将今天与2000年进行比较和对比非常有帮助。2000年的互联网泡沫或电信泡沫是由一种称为**暗光纤**（Dark Fiber: 已铺设但未被点亮或使用的光纤）的东西定义的。在泡沫高峰期，97%已铺设的光纤都是暗的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh, I do not believe we're in an AI bubble today. I was, depending on how you look at it, the privilege and the misfortune of being a tech investor during the year 2000 bubble, which was really a telecom bubble. And I think it's really helpful to compare and contrast today to the year 2000. The year 2000 internet bubble or telecom bubble was defined by something called dark fiber. At the peak, 97% of the fiber that had been laid was dark.</p>
</details>

与今天形成对比的是，现在没有**暗GPU**（Dark GPU: 指未被充分利用或闲置的图形处理器）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Contrast that with today. There are no dark GPUs.</p>
</details>

David George提出了一个禁忌问题：如果AI是当今世界最大的趋势，那它存在的证据在哪里？为什么它才刚刚开始在经济中显现？正如Andre Carpathy所问，AI代理真的只是“幽灵”吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that brings us to our opening fireside chat. We're going to start with a taboo question right out of the gate. Are you ready for it? If AI love it. If AI is the biggest trend in the world right now, where is the evidence for it? Why is it only just beginning to show up in the economy? And as Andre Carpathy asked, are agents really just ghosts?</p>
</details>

为了回答这个问题，David George介绍了Atrades的管理合伙人兼首席信息官Gavin Baker，以及A16Z的普通合伙人David George本人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To kick this off and to help us answer this question, please join us in welcoming Gavin Baker, managing partner and CIO of Atrades. Now, some of you may know Gavin as that really thoughtful guy on Twitter. Anytime some big piece of AI news comes out, I know more than a few people who count on Gavin to explain what the f is really going on. So, a huge thank you to Gavin for being with us today. Joining him is our very own David George, general partner at A16Z.</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker对受邀表示感谢，并期待在接下来的两天里学到很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same. Um really grateful to you for inviting me, grateful to your colleagues for having me here. I'm really look forward to the next uh two days. I think I'm going to learn a lot. So, thank you.</p>
</details>

### AI基础设施投资与回报

David George首先引用了一些数据来铺垫：美国目前拥有约一万亿美元的数据中心，并计划在未来五年内再增加三到四万亿美元。在过去三年中，美国在数据中心容量上的投资金额已经超过了整个美国州际公路系统（耗时40年建成，已根据通货膨胀调整）的总投资。仅OpenAI一家公司就承诺了超过一万亿美元的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay. All right. So, the big topic is AI bubble kind of macro view of things. Um, so maybe just to start with a couple stats to set the stage and then I want to get your take on on where we're at. So we have about a trillion dollars of data centers in the US. The plan is to add 3 to4 trillion in the next 5 years. Over the past three years, we have already built out in data center capacity a larger amount of dollars than the entire US interstate highway system, which took 40 years just in terms of dollars. And that's a inflation adjusted. OpenAI alone I think has more than a trillion dollars of deals set up that they've committed to and we can talk about that. Um</p>
</details>

与此同时，谷歌最近发布了一项数据，显示在过去17个月中，他们处理的**令牌**（Tokens: 文本或代码的基本处理单元）数量增加了150倍。因此，一方面是听起来令人担忧的疯狂基础设施建设，另一方面却是大量实际使用正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but at the same time, so those are all like big numbers on infrastructure and they're scary and they say oh bubble and Google uh released a stat recently that they have seen a 150x increase in the amount of tokens processed in the last 17 months. So on the one hand you've got this crazy scary sounding buildout. On the other hand you actually have a bunch of usage that's happening. So are we in an AI bubble?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker再次强调，他认为我们今天并未处于AI泡沫之中。他将今天与2000年泡沫时期进行对比，指出思科（Cisco）在当时估值达到150到180倍的追踪市盈率，而英伟达（Nvidia）目前约为40倍，估值差异巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh I do not believe we're in an AI bubble today. Uh I was um I had depending on how you look at it the privilege and the misfortune of being a tech investor during the um the year 2000 bubble which was really a telecom bubble. And I think it's really helpful to compare and contrast today to the year 2000. um you know first I think uh Cisco peaked at 150 or 180 times trailing earnings Nvidia is at more like 40 times so valuations are very differently very different most</p>
</details>

然而，最重要的是，2000年的互联网泡沫或电信泡沫是由**暗光纤**定义的。暗光纤是铺设在地下的光纤，但并未被“点亮”使用。光纤本身毫无用处，除非两端都有所需的光学设备、交换机和路由器。他清楚地记得，像Level 3、Global Crossing或WorldCom这样的公司会宣称：“我们这个季度铺设了20万英里的暗光纤，这太棒了，互联网将变得如此庞大，我们迫不及待地要点亮它们。”在泡沫高峰期，美国97%已铺设的光纤都是暗的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">important however is that the year 2000 internet bubble or telecom bubble was defined by something called dark fiber um and if you're a veteran of of the year 2000 you'll know what that was but dark fiber was literally fiber that was laid down in the ground and not lit up. Fiber is useless unless you have the optics and switches and routers uh that you need on either side. Um you so I vividly remember, you know, companies like Level 3 or Global Crossing or WorldCom would come in and they say, "We laid 200,000 miles of dark fiber this quarter. This is so amazing. The internet's going to be so big. Um you know, we can't wait to light these up." At the peak of the bubble, 97% of the fiber that had been laid in America was dark.</p>
</details>

与今天形成对比的是，现在没有**暗GPU**。任何技术论文都表明，训练运行中最大的问题之一是**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器）正在“熔化”，即被充分利用到极限。有一个非常简单的方法可以切中问题的核心：那就是**投入资本回报率**（ROIC: Return On Invested Capital）——那些在GPU上投入最大的公司，它们都是上市公司，自增加**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure: 资本性支出）以来，**ROIC**平均增长了10个百分点。因此，到目前为止，所有支出的**投资回报率**（ROI: Return On Investment）都非常积极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Contrast that with today. There are no dark GPUs. All you have to do is read any technical paper. And that one of the biggest problems in a training run is that GPUs are melting. And there's a very simple way to kind of cut to the heart of all of this. It is the return on invested capital of the biggest spenders on GPUs who are all public and those companies since they ramped up capex have seen call it a 10point increase in their ROIC's. So thus far the ROI on all the spending has been really positive. It's a really it's an interesting and open debate about whether or not it will continue to be positive with the quantum of spend we're going to have on Blackwell. I personally think it will, but there's no debate that thus far the ROI on AI has been really positive and valuation wise. We're just not in a bubble.</p>
</details>

这是一个有趣且开放的辩论，关于在**Blackwell**（英伟达下一代GPU架构）上的巨额支出是否会继续带来积极的投资回报。Gavin Baker个人认为会的，但毫无疑问，到目前为止，AI的投资回报一直非常积极，而且从估值来看，我们并未处于泡沫之中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a really it's an interesting and open debate about whether or not it will continue to be positive with the quantum of spend we're going to have on Blackwell. I personally think it will, but there's no debate that thus far the ROI on AI has been really positive and valuation wise. We're just not in a bubble.</p>
</details>

David George补充说，可以将今天的技术采纳和使用情况与过去进行对比。互联网当时实际上很难推广，因为它需要建立一个双边网络，即既要建立网站，又要吸引用户，这要困难得多。而对于AI工具，你只需通过**API**（Application Programming Interface: 应用程序编程接口）将其“点亮”，或者打开ChatGPT网站，所有人都可以立即访问。它们建立在云计算和互联网之上，可以立即分发给数十亿人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I couldn't agree more. The other thing that I would say is you can contrast the actual adoption and usage of the technology from then, right? The internet was actually really hard because you had to build a two-sided network. like you had to build websites and then you had to get users and it's much more difficult in the case of the AI tools you know all you have to do is kind of light them up via API or you know turn on your website chatgpt and everybody has access to them right built on top of cloud computing on top of the internet uh and you know you can get to instant distribution a billion people right away</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker指出，这些投资方恰好是世界上最优秀的公司。他认为，这些为**资本支出**（Capex）买单的公司，每年集体产生约3000亿美元的自由现金流，资产负债表上还有5000亿美元的现金。因此，当人们担心“天哪，这是一个泡沫，它会破裂吗？”时，他认为情况还不错。点亮一吉瓦的电力大约需要400到500亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely so uh the other thing is the counterparties so you mentioned this they happen to be the best companies in the history of the world right I think collectively the people who are coming out of pocket. They're writing checks uh for this capex. I think they collectively generate like $300 billion of free cash flow a year. Is that right? Some directionally round numbers. Yeah. And they have $500 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So whenever people are like, "Oh my god, it's a bubble. Is it going to pop?" I'm like, I think it's kind of fine. I mean, you know, it costs like4 or 50 billion to light up one gigawatt.</p>
</details>

这意味着有一个大约8000亿美元的缓冲，并且每年还在增长3000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, there's kind of like an $800 billion buffer growing $300 billion every year.</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker提到，拉里·佩奇（Larry Page）据说曾在内部表示：“我宁愿破产也不愿输掉这场竞赛。”他认为这正是谷歌（Google）和可能还有Meta（Meta）的心态，他们认为这是一场关乎生存的竞争，必须取胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know, it's you know, Larry Page apparently internally said, I'm happy to go bankrupt rather than lose this race. And I think that is the mentality for sure at Google and perhaps Meta. um it's just seen as existential and you have to win.</p>
</details>

### AI竞争格局：芯片与模型之战

David George提到了关于**循环交易**（Round-tripping deals: 指资金从一方流出，经过一系列交易后又回到原点，通常用于规避规定或制造虚假交易量）的讨论，这是一个在互联网建设时期曾引发大问题的概念。他询问Gavin Baker对此有何看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, uh lots has been written about these roundtpping deals. So, give me the because you know roundtpping is a very scary concept from you know the internet buildout that was a big problem. What do you make of it here?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker回应说，循环交易客观上正在发生，因为资金是可互换的。英伟达（Nvidia）与OpenAI签订协议时，可以说“你不能用我们的钱来购买我们的芯片”，但资金的本质是可互换的。不过，这种现象的规模非常小。他认为推动这种现象的不是为GPU或数据中心采购提供资金的需求，而是竞争动态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is objectively happening. Um you know money is fungeible. So Nvidia if they sign a deal with OpenAI they can say hey you can't use our money to buy our chips but money is fungeible. But it's happening at a very small scale. Yes. Yeah. And I think um I didn't know this was like a crypto or blockchain. Exactly. Good. Yeah. And I think what is driving um what is driving this isn't the need to, you know, finance GPU or data center purchases, but it's actually com competitive dynamics.</p>
</details>

英伟达最大的竞争对手不是AMD、不是Broadcom、也不是Intel，而是谷歌。更具体地说，是谷歌，因为谷歌拥有**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌专为机器学习工作负载设计的**专用集成电路**ASIC芯片）。这可能是目前唯一能替代英伟达进行训练的芯片，也可能是最佳的推理替代方案。谷歌是一个具有挑战性的竞争对手，因为它还拥有DeepMind公司和**Gemini**产品。Gavin Baker认为谷歌可能是当今领先的AI公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Nvidia's biggest competitor, it's not AMD, it's not Broadcom, um, you know, it's it's certainly not Marll. Um, it's not it's not Intel, it's Google. And more specifically, it is Google because Google owns uh the TPU chip. And this is by far maybe perhaps today the only um alternative to NVIDIA for training um and maybe the best uh inference alternative. And what Google and Google's a problematic competitor because they also own a company called DeepMind and they have a product called Gemini. Um and I think you could argue that they are the leading um AI company today.</p>
</details>

在过去两三个月里，谷歌的流量份额增加了15到20个百分点，这仅仅是Gemini的流量，不包括搜索概览。他猜测，从实际流量来看，谷歌今天比OpenAI、Anthropic或任何其他公司都要大，而且这项业务将运行在**TPU**上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they've taken 15 or 20 points of traffic share in the last two or three months and that does not that's just traffic to Gemini. It does not include search overviews. I suspect on a actual traffic basis, Google is bigger than OpenAI, Enthropic, anyone today and that that business is going to run on TPUs.</p>
</details>

目前还有其他三个重要的实验室：Anthropic（亚马逊和谷歌的专属合作伙伴），它主要运行在**TPU**和**Tranium**（亚马逊的AI芯片）上。因此，只剩下XAI和OpenAI处于领先地位。如果谷歌向Anthropic这样的实验室提供资金支持和芯片，那么英伟达出于竞争原因很难不做出回应。正如**Jensen Huang**（英伟达CEO）所说，他认为这将是一项很好的投资。因此，Gavin Baker认为对循环交易的担忧被过分夸大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we have three other labs that are relevant today. There's Enthropic and that's an Amazon and T that's an Amazon and Google captive. Uh, trrenium is um, you know, Enthropic is really going to run on uh, TPUs and traniums. And so you're left with XAI and OpenAI at the forefront. And if Google is going to a lab like Enthropic and saying, I'm going to help you fund raise and give you chips, I think for competitive reasons, it's very hard for Nvidia not to respond. And as Jensen said, he thinks it's going to be a good investment. Um, so I think the roundtpping concerns are pretty overblown.</p>
</details>

David George补充说，英伟达真正需要的是Meta能振作起来，或者出现另一个美国开源玩家，或者与中国在AI领域达成某种缓和。Gavin Baker认为，英伟达所做的一切都是完全理性的。Jensen Huang是他所认识的两位最优秀的CEO之一（另一位是**Elon Musk**），他认为Jensen Huang正在很好地运用手中的强大牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And what I mean what Nvidia really needs is they need you know Meta to get their act together or another American open source player to emerge or you know maybe some sort of um dant with China and AI. Yeah. Yeah. I when people ask me about Nvidia and all the moves and the roundtpping my reaction is everything they've done is completely rational. 100% rational. Yeah. Long term. Yeah. Sure. things they do may not have as high of a return on capital as other things, but strategically I think they're all kind of the right moves. Jensen's one of the two best CEOs along with Elon I have ever known. Um, and I think he's he's playing a strong hand really well.</p>
</details>

### 应用层市场结构与SaaS的未来

关于模型公司的市场结构，Gavin Baker认为投资者需要保持谦逊。如果我们将**ChatGPT**比作AI领域的网景浏览器（Netscape Navigator）之于互联网，那么在互联网繁荣的那个阶段，谷歌尚未成立，**Mark Zuckerberg**还在读中学，**Travis Kalanick**还在读幼儿园。所以现在还非常早期。他认为在应用层做出高确定性预测是很重要的。这也是为什么在这些新技术浪潮的初期，基础设施层通常是一个更安全的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. All right. So, you started getting into the model companies. Let's just talk about the model. So, we can come back to chips and memory and networking because I want to get your take on that, but you know, since we're on the model side, what do you think happens with market structure? who wins where, you know, who are you most optimistic about? You know, where do you have concerns? So, um I think humility is an important virtue for an investor. And I'm just if we're going to make an analogy and say that chat GPT is to AI has Netscape Navigator was to the internet. At this point in the internet boom, Google had not been founded. Mark Zuckerberg was in middle school. um Travis Kalanick was in was in kindergarten. Um so it's just very early. So I think it's important to be humble um about making high confidence predictions at the application layer. It's one reason I think the the infrastructure layer is often maybe a safe place to be at the beginning of one of these new technology waves.</p>
</details>

他认为AI可能是一种**持续性创新**（Sustaining Innovation: 指现有产品或服务在性能上不断改进，满足现有市场需求），因为数据、购买算力的资本和分发渠道这些核心要素，当今最大的几家科技公司都拥有。只要它们执行得好，雇佣优秀人才，并有健全的战略，AI就能成为**“七巨头”**（Mag 7: 指美国市值最高的七家科技公司）中许多成员的持续性创新。另一方面，他认为AI也事关生存，如果执行不力，可能会面临像**IBM**一样的命运。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's reasonable arguments that AI could be a sustaining innovation because the raw ingredients of kind of data, you know, the capital to buy compute and distribution, which is what you need. All of the big um, you know, today's biggest tech companies have all of those in spades. So, as long as they execute well, hire good people, um, and have a sound strategy, like I think you could see it be a sustaining innovation for a lot of members of the Mag 7. On the other hand, I do think it's existential and if you don't execute, you know, IBM might be a might be a good fate.</p>
</details>

David George总结道，这些公司拥有数据、分发、算力、资金和人才，它们完全有理由获胜。现在它们似乎比以往任何时候都更认真地对待这件事，特别是谷歌和Meta。Gavin Baker认为，ChatGPT对谷歌来说就是“珍珠港事件”，我们将看到他们如何回应，他们也正在缓慢开始回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's uh that's tough. Uh, yeah. Data, distribution, compute, dollars, talent. Yeah. And like they have every right to win. Yeah, they have every right to win. And it seems now more than before, they're taking it quite seriously. Yeah, maybe Google in particular, but obviously Meta Meta is making the dramatic moves they're making, too. No, to me, Chat GPT was Pearl Harbor for Google, and we're going to see how they responded, and they're slowly starting to respond.</p>
</details>

关于平台业务中基础设施部分的商业模式和市场结构，Gavin Baker不认为它们会像航空公司那样利润微薄，但任何人都可以查看2021年和2022年**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）公司的损益表，会看到80%到90%的**毛利率**（Gross Margins）。AI的性质，由于其扩展定律，需要更多的计算资源，因此其毛利率在结构上会更低。但这并不意味着它们不能成为伟大的企业。他认为，在很长一段时间内，我们不会看到任何AI实验室或前沿实验室的毛利率接近SaaS或互联网时代的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And then what do you think what's your forecast for uh that sort of in the platform piece of their business, the infrastructure piece? What do you think? How do you think it shakes out in terms of like business model market structure? So do you think they end up as high margin businesses like the clouds or like aircraft manufacturers or do you think they end up very competitive and low margin businesses like airlines? Um I don't think they will be airlines but you can anybody can just look at the P&L you know of a SAS company circa 2021 and 2022 and you see you know 80 90% gross margins and the nature of AI because of scaling laws Richard Sutton's the better the bitter listen um they're just more compute inensive so their gross margins are structurally going to be lower but that doesn't mean they can't be great businesses is I just I think it's going to be a long time before we see a truly kind of you know an AI lab a frontier lab with gross margins anywhere near SAS or internet era margins now their opex can be a lot lower um and you know maybe that's how you square it but just the gross margins are fundamentally different and until scaling laws change and the importance of test time compute and things like that change which I don't see happening they're they are going to be lower margin.</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker表示，他曾在2024年初说过，所有应用层SaaS可能都会归零，但基础设施SaaS不同。现在他有了更细致的看法，认为可能会出现一些非常成功的应用层SaaS赢家，特别是那些服务于更分散的**中小企业**（SMB: Small and Medium-sized Businesses）客户群体的公司。谷歌让客户很容易使用他们的数据，并创建任何想要的SaaS应用，而且数据不会与其他人共享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I think I, you know, first said probably in early 24 that I thought all of application SAS might be a zero different than than um infrastructure SAS. I I would say I have a more nuanced view now and I think there could be some really big application SAS winners, especially if you serve like a more fragmented SMB customer base. Um, you know, Google has make it really easy if you're a customer of theirs to use your data and essentially make any SAS app you want and then your data isn't shared with anyone else. Um, but the critical mistake that I think a lot of retailers made um in dealing with Amazon is they looked at Amazon's margins and they said we don't want to be in that business. And that was obviously a terrible mistake. And here we are 25 years later and you know Amazon has really healthy uh retail margins.</p>
</details>

他担心应用层SaaS公司正试图维持其现有的毛利率结构，因为他们认为如果毛利率下降，股价也会下跌。然而，鉴于我们刚刚讨论的，在AI领域取得成功，毛利率压力是必然的。他不知道他们为何担忧，因为我们有微软（Microsoft）和Adobe这样的例子，它们在AI出现之前就很好地应对了利润率下降的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I worry that application SAS companies are trying to preserve their existing gross margin structures because they believe that if their gross margins go down um their stocks will go down. It is definitionally impossible given what we just discussed to succeed in AI without gross margin pressure. And I do not know why they have concerns because we have an existence proof that a software company can deal well with declining margins in Microsoft in Adobe to the whole AI thing came along.</p>
</details>

过去，公司害怕从本地部署转向云端，因为云端利润率较低。云端利润率确实较低，但仍然很好。微软成功地从本地部署的永久许可模式过渡到云模式，并在十年内成为一支表现不错的股票。因此，如果一家应用层SaaS公司，Gavin Baker会建议他们不要害怕，将毛利率下降视为成功的标志，而不是耻辱或恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it used to be that companies were scared to go from on premise to the cloud because margins were lower. Cloud margins are are are lower. They're still good. And Microsoft, they transitioned, you know, from, you know, on premise perpetual licenses with maintenance uh to a cloud model. and it was a pretty good stock for 10 years. So I don't if you're an application SAS company like I what I would just say is don't be scared and look at declining gross margins kind of has a mark of success rather than you know a badge of shame or something to be feared.</p>
</details>

David George指出，这很有趣，因为当公司向他们展示时，基本上每家公司都说自己是AI公司。他们总是会关注毛利率，而现在低毛利率反而成了这些公司的荣誉勋章，因为这意味着“天哪，人们真的在使用你们的AI产品！”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's actually so funny you say that because whenever we have these discussions about companies, basically every company that comes to present to us is like we're an AI company and um we always look at the gross margins and it's become like a badge of honor for them to actually have low gross margins because like oh my god people are actually using your AI stuff. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker补充说，如果你说自己是AI公司，但毛利率高达82%，那可能意味着没有人真正使用你的AI产品。他认为，如果一家上市公司宁愿拥有10美元收入但毛利率90%，还是50美元收入但毛利率60%，答案显而易见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you show up and you're like I'm an AI company and it's like I got 82% gross margins. You're like I don't think anybody's really using it. Uh so yeah it's uh it's interesting. Yeah. If you're if you're one of these public companies, would you rather have like 10 bucks of revenue with 90% gross margins or 50 bucks of revenue with 60% gross margins? Not hard. Like it's not that comp Yeah, not that complicated.</p>

在公开市场中做到这一点很难，但如果能很好地沟通，并与云转型进行类比，投资者会对此感到兴奋。这些传统应用层SaaS公司的巨大优势在于，它们拥有非常盈利的现有业务。因此，它们可以以收支平衡的方式运营新的AI产品，并追赶领导者。Gavin Baker对为何没有更多公司这样做感到惊讶，例如，为什么没有一家上市公司试图与**Cursor**（一款AI驱动的代码编辑器）竞争？

<p class="english-text">It's hard to do in public, but if you communicate it, you draw parallels to the cloud transition. I mean, I'm an investor and I would be excited about it, you know, and I don't think I'm alone in the world. And then the big advantage these legacy application SAS companies have is they do have these really profitable existing businesses. And so you can run your new AI products at break even um and you know catch up to the leaders etc etc and I'm just surprised more people have not done that like why are none of the public coding companies even trying to compete with cursor and the reality is cursor now they have a trillion trillion tokens and you know there there will be a point where they have enough coding tokens that it's tough to catch them but I think today if you're a public coding and you said, "I'm going to lean in. I'm going to run it break even. I have an existing business. I'm going to attach it to everything." Hey, you have a chance. And you know, the prize is clearly really big.</p>
</details>

他认为，如果一家上市公司现在说“我要全力投入，以收支平衡的方式运营，我有一个现有业务，我要把它附加到所有产品上”，那么它就有机会。David George提到，Figma就是一个例子，他们拥有极高的毛利率，但积极分发AI工具后，毛利率会下降。投资者在提出一些澄清问题后，认为这实际上是一件好事。

<p class="english-text">I see Martin is skeptical. Martin's shaking his head. You have a chance. I said a chance. So, I said a chance. That's like a dumb and dumber. You're telling me there's a chance, not like a real chance. You're telling me. You're telling me there's a chance. Yes. Exactly. It's like a Yeah, exactly. I totally agree. Yeah, we actually saw I mean you know we see it uh you know we may if we if we you know Figma for example like when they went out they are extremely high gross margin and they're like hey we're going to you know pretty aggressively distribute our AI tools and our gross margins are going to go down and you know investors asked a few clarifying questions and then they were like oh that actually would be a good thing and so surprised more people in the public markets aren't doing it worked out okay for them</p>

### 消费者AI与商业模式的演变

David George谈到消费端应用层，谷歌曾是互联网的门户，现在也仍然是。其商业模式建立在获取用户意图并将其导向其他网站的基础上。但AI的出现改变了这一切。他尝试了AI浏览器进行一些基本的购物，虽然还有改进空间，但他相信它会实现。他询问Gavin Baker对消费互联网公司市场结构的看法，它们是否会被整合到聊天机器人界面中，还是会以其他方式发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's working out well uh long game to play what about on the consumer side at the application layer so obviously ly Google was the portal to the internet is kind of still is the portal to the internet and the whole business model was predicated upon taking some intent and directing you to someone else's website where they would do stuff with you. It's kind of not going to be that way. It already is not that way uh with uh with AI. Although I tried the browser today and I tried to do some pretty basic shopping stuff and it's you know it's still still some work to do but I think it will get there. So what do you actually think happens with the sort of market structure of the consumer internet companies? Do they get subsumed into a component of a chatbot interface or do you think it's something else?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker表示，很难预测。他认为那些推出AI浏览器的公司可能会后悔，因为谷歌的**Chrome**浏览器拥有50亿用户。谷歌在处理这类问题时非常谨慎，部分原因是与政府的诉讼。他们本可以轻易地做得更好，但他们不想做第一个。现在，两家AI原生公司推出了自己的浏览器，让它们运行三到六个月，获得一点先发优势，然后谷歌就可以说“我们不得不这样做”。他不知道这会如何发展，也许对那些不拥有Chrome的公司来说会是不同的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so one humility hard to say. to I would just say I think um the AI companies that have launched these AI browsers may come to regret it because there's something called Chrome that has whatever it is 5 billion users and if you're Google um you know you can just go look at what happened with Google Buzz you they are very cautious you know there's you know they're currently in in litigation with the government um and they could easily do this and probably do it even better, but they didn't want to be first. So now you have two AI native companies with their own browsers, let them run for 3 to 6 months, get a little head start, and then wow, here we are. We had to do this. And I don't know how that's going to work. Um maybe for the companies other than Google who don't own Chrome. Um</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker认为，现在很难与那些拥有庞大现有用户群的公司抗衡。他还认为**推理**（Reasoning: 指AI模型理解、分析和解决问题的能力）从根本上改变了这些前沿模型的经济学。在推理出现之前，他常说，如果没有独特、有价值的数据和互联网规模的分发，前沿模型将是历史上贬值最快的资产。推理改变了这一点，因为在后训练阶段，**强化学习**（RL: Reinforcement Learning: 一种机器学习范式，通过与环境互动学习最优行为）的工作方式使得庞大的用户群能够解锁**飞轮效应**（Flywheel Effect: 指企业通过一系列相互关联的良性循环，实现持续增长和加速发展）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, hindsight's 2020. Um, and the one thing I would say is I do think it's tough to bet against the companies with large existing user bases today. Um, and I also think reasoning has fundamentally changed the economics of these frontier models. you know, pre-reasoning. Um, I often said if you are a frontier model without access to unique, valuable data and internet scale distribution, you're the fastest depreciating asset in history. I think reasoning really changed that because the way RL works during post training, having a big user base now kind of unlocks that flywheel that was at the center of every great consumer internet company where um you have a good product, you get a lot of users, the users make the algorithm better, um the algorithm makes the product better and it just spins. And that it's not quite spinning yet in AI, but you can squint and see it. And so I think that fundamentally changes economics for anthropic, for XAI, um, for OpenAI. Um, but I mean Mark Zuckerberg's trying hard.</p>
</details>

这种飞轮效应是每个伟大的消费互联网公司的核心：拥有好产品，吸引大量用户，用户使算法更好，算法使产品更好，从而不断循环。在AI领域，这种效应尚未完全显现，但已初见端倪。他认为这从根本上改变了Anthropic、XAI和OpenAI的经济模式。**Mark Zuckerberg**正在努力尝试。

</details>

Gavin Baker认为，中国开源模型生态系统对任何试图追赶这四个领先实验室的美国公司来说都是天赐之物，因为如果你没有**Gemini 2.5 Pro**或其后续版本，或者Grock的后续版本，或者GPT的后续版本，那么在训练下一个模型时就会处于劣势。他补充说，那些声称**GPT-5**是扩展定律终结的人让他很抓狂。GPT-5是一个更小的模型，它的设计目的不是为了更好，而是为了让OpenAI和微软运行它更经济。任何提及GPT-5及其扩展定律的说法都是错误的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of smart people in there now. Yeah, for sure. I I think the worry is and I think this is another interesting thing is if you don't like in a strange way the Chinese open source model ecosystem is a godsend to any American company that's trying to catch those four leading labs because the problem is if you don't have Gemini 2.5 Pro or a later checkpoint of it or a later checkpoint of Grock that we don't see or a later GPT checkmate uh checkpoint training the next model you're at a disadvantage. Oh, by the way, one thing I just want to say that drives me crazy is all these people who say that GPT5 is the end of scaling loss. GPT5 is a smaller model. It was not designed to be better. It was designed to be more economical for OpenAI and Microsoft to run it. Any reference to GPT5 its scaling laws is crazy. Um, yeah. Sorry. Rant rant over.</p>

### AI与机器人技术的展望

David George询问Gavin Baker对芯片市场的看法，包括英伟达、AMD、TPU、**ASIC**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuit: 专用集成电路）以及各种参与者的竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got the pedestal up here if you want. Yeah, exactly. Shaking your hand. Yeah, we could. Yeah, that'd be good. Uh, do you want to talk about chips? Sure. So, okay. I know you love Nvidia. Talk about, you know, your view of Nvidia, AMD, TPUs, AS6, and how do you think sort of market structure shakes out there, you know, competitive advantage that the various players have?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker认为，这实际上是英伟达与谷歌**TPU**之间的竞争。他指出，Broadcom和AMD实际上正在合作进入市场，这一点并未被广泛认识。英伟达不再仅仅是一家半导体公司，正如**Jensen Huang**明天会提到的，它曾是一家半导体公司，然后是一家拥有**CUDA**（Compute Unified Device Architecture: 英伟达的并行计算平台和编程模型）的软件公司，现在是一家提供机架级解决方案的系统公司，甚至可以说是一家数据中心级公司，通过其**Scale-Up**（纵向扩展）和**Scale-Out**（横向扩展）网络架构进行设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um I think it goes I think it is really um it's a fight between Nvidia and um the Google TPU and then something that I don't think is broadly appreciated is the extent to which Broadcom and AMD are effectively going to market together. Nvidia is no longer just a a semiconductor company as I'm sure you'll hear from Jensen tomorrow. you know not it was a semiconductor company then a software company with CUDA now systems company with these rack level solutions and now arguably you know a data center level uh company with the you know level of architecting they're doing with scale up scale across and um scale out scale across networking um</p>
</details>

网络、结构和软件都非常重要。Broadcom正在向Meta等公司表示：“我们将为您构建一个理论上可以与英伟达的**NVLink**（英伟达的高速互联技术）与**Infiniband**（一种高速网络互联技术）或**Ethernet**（以太网）混合的结构竞争的结构。”它将基于**Ethernet**，是一个开放标准。而且，他们会为客户制造自己的**TPU**版本，而谷歌花了三代才使其正常工作。如果客户的**ASIC**不够好，他们可以直接插入AMD的芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so the networking the fabric the software it's all important and what Broadcom is saying to companies like Meta is hey we will build you a fabric that can theor theoretically compete with Nvidia's fabric which is a mixture of NVLink and either Infiniband or Ethernet. Um it will build it on Ethernet. It's going to be an open standard. And hey, we'll we'll make you your version of of TPU, which by the way took Google three generations to get working. And you know what? If your ASIC isn't good, you can just plug AMD right in. Um</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker个人认为，大多数这些**ASIC**将会失败，特别是在未来三年内，我们会看到许多高调的ASIC项目被取消，尤其是如果谷歌开始对外销售**TPU**的话。他认为这实际上是谷歌及其**TPU**（目前由Broadcom支持）与英伟达之间的较量。谷歌可以随时将**TPU**从Broadcom手中拿走。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I personally believe most of those AS6s are going to fail. um particularly if it's in the fullness of time like over a period of time or in the fullness of time in the next 3 years I think you'll see a bunch of high-profile um ASIC programs canled especially if Google um starts selling TPUs externally which has been all over X and you know they you know who knows exactly how that would work because if you're anthropic you know it's just rumored anthropic wants to buy tens of billions of TPUs if you're anthropic maybe you don't want Google seeing your secret sauce but there's ways around on that. So I think this is really a battle between Google and its TPU enabled by Broadcom for now and Google can take the TPU away from Broadcom whenever they want.</p>
</details>

亚马逊的**Tranium**芯片团队（Anapurna团队）非常有才华，**Tranium 3**可能会比**Tranium 2**好得多，就像**TPU**花了三代才完善一样。而AMD将永远是第二供应商，而且市场需要第二供应商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Now they can't do the Ethernet networking that Broadcom is is doing uh but they control the TPU. Um so it's really Google and the TPU verse um Nvidia you know with with you know Amazon like that's a very talented team arguably the most talented silicon tumidity hyperscaler the anaperna team like I think the tranium 3 will probably be a much better chip than the tranium 2 it took three generations to get the TPU right um and then AMD will you know will always be kind of the second source and you need a second source</p>
</details>

David George回到了商业模式的话题，他指出，颠覆的来源通常出现在一个大的平台转变伴随着商业模式转变的时候。例如，在客户支持领域，像**Decagon**这样的公司，其商业模式可以很容易地根据任务解决情况定价，因为它非常可衡量。在编程领域，许多商业模式已转向基于消费的模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all right exciting uh what do you think happens Okay. So I want to go back um to business models. So one of the big things that is widely discussed is like you know source of disruption and most of the CEOs in this room are CEOs of startups who are trying to go beat some incumbent or find you know some new market opportunity and the most ripe opportunities tend to come when you have a big platform shift that is also accompanied with a business model shift. Um and so there are a couple of areas where I can see it. I feel like in an obvious way. So, you know, we're investors in decagon customer support like you can pretty easily see a business model that is priced on the resolution of a task because it's so measurable. Um you can see you know like in coding like a lot of the business model has now shifted to consumption and you know obviously especially for developer facing things like that's comfortable um and pretty wellnown. What about the rest of the industry? Cuz I feel like there's sort of this handwave thing that is going on which is like we're going to go get all of services but it's like okay so how do you actually go do that? It's going to be pretty hard. So do you have any prediction on how that plays out?</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker认为，在客户服务领域，这是一个容易的例子，因为有大量的文本数据，而**大型语言模型**（LLM: Large Language Model）擅长处理文本。你可以很容易地运行一些**强化学习**（RL）来确保它们获得良好的验证奖励，例如让客户满意或首次呼叫解决问题。他认为人类的报酬是基于结果的，AI将增强人类，但也可能取代一些人类，这都将涉及基于结果的报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think what you're seeing in customer service which is kind of like an easy first example u where you have a lot of textual data that LLMs are good at text. you can kind of, you know, probably really easily run some RL to make sure that they, you know, get a good verified reward. You know, verified reward being a happy customer or first call resolution or whatever it is. Um, and but I do think you will see that played out like humans, we're fundamentally paid for paid paid based on outcomes and a lot of AI will be augmenting humans, but probably also replacing some humans and that will involve being paid u paid for outcomes.</p>
</details>

回到消费商业模式，每个人都在谈论**联盟营销费用**（Affiliate Fees）。Gavin Baker相信他将拥有自己的AI版本**Grock**（XAI开发的AI模型），因为它了解并喜欢他。下次他想度假时，它会知道他喜欢去哪些酒店，并说：“嘿，有三家酒店，Gavin要来了，谁能提供最好的价格和房间？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, going back to the consumer business model, you know, everybody's talking about affiliate fees. And for sure, I'm going to have, you know, my own AI. It will be a version of Grock, um, because we're both XAI shareholders. It will be a version of Grock that knows me and it likes me. Um, and, you know, when I when I want to, you know, the next time I want to go on vacation, it will know the hotels that I like to go to and it'll say, "Hey, three hotels. I have Gavin, you know, I have Gavin coming. Who's got the best price and the best room?" Um,</p>
</details>

David George开玩笑说，这会大大提升Gavin送给Becky的礼物档次。Gavin Baker补充说，届时可能会有某种联盟营销费用，这同样是基于结果的报酬，并形成一个闭环。谷歌从未启动市场平台的原因是人们系统性地高估了他们通过谷歌获取客户后将其保留为自然客户的能力。因此，他们系统性地支付过高费用。这种低效率将被挤压出去，转向基于结果的模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's going to massively upgrade the gifts that you give to Becky just in case as Becky Becky's in the audience. She really appreciated your Dumb and Dumber reference. I'll have you know. Um, but um yeah, and then there will probably be some sort of affiliate fee. And again, that's just being paid for an outcome and kind of closing that loop, which will be probably a little bit of a business model degradation because the great why why did Google never start a marketplace? because people overvalue systematically their ability once they've acquired a customer through Google to keep it as an organic customer. So they systematically overpay and they continue doing that. That's why Google never went to outcomes or marketplace because advertising leads to the advertisers systematically overpaying. So that inefficiency will be squeezed out but yeah we'll go to outcomes and you know I think Elon tweeted today that you know work would become optional you know like instead of buying your vegetables um you know at a at a supermarket you can grow your own garden if you want. Now, who knows how long it takes us to get there, but I that doesn't sound wildly implausible to me for how powerful this technology is.</p>
</details>

Gavin Baker提到**Elon Musk**今天发推文说工作将变得可选，就像你可以选择自己种菜而不是去超市买菜一样。虽然不知道何时能实现，但他认为这对于AI的强大程度来说并非完全不可信。他惊讶于**Andre Karpathy**两天前被描绘成一个怀疑论者，仅仅因为他说**通用人工智能**（AGI: Artificial General Intelligence: 能够理解、学习或执行任何人类智力任务的AI）还需要十年才能实现。他觉得这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was just struck Karpathy, you know, whatever two days ago, you know, is being painted as like a skeptic for saying AGI is 10 years away. Are you kidding? Insane. 10 years. Yeah. Yeah. Sign me up. We have shorter timelines, please.</p>

### AI与机器人技术的展望

David George询问Gavin Baker对机器人技术的看法。Gavin Baker认为机器人技术非常真实，未来将是特斯拉（Tesla）与中国企业之间的竞争，就像电动汽车领域一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, so no, that's awesome. While we're on the topic of very exciting futuristic things, robotics, do you have a view on Yeah, very real. And it's going to be Tesla versus the Chinese in the same way it's Tesla versus the Chinese in in uh cars. Electric cars. Yeah. Yeah. I would just say cars, not electric cars. Yeah. Cars.</p>
</details>

关于时间线，Gavin Baker指出人们可以观看**Optimus**（特斯拉开发的人形机器人）的视频。他认识的每一位机器人专家都对此印象深刻。关于是**人形机器人**（Humanoids）还是非人形机器人的争论已经结束，因为人形机器人可以通过观看YouTube视频学习，人类也可以穿上特制服装向机器人展示如何操作。看到50个Optimus机器人执行50种不同任务的视频，并简单判断它们是否正确地将玻璃杯放入洗碗机，这简直太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Do you have a sense of timeline? I mean, you can you can all watch the Optimus videos. Um, every roboticist I know is extremely impressed. Um, you know, there's there's a giant debate. Is it going to be humanoids or not humanoids? I think that debate is over because humanoids can kind of learn, you know, from watching YouTube videos and then it's easier for a human being um, you know, to put on a suit and show the robot how to do it. I mean, it's kind of crazy to watch the video of all, you know, the 50 Optimus robots doing 50 different tasks and then it's very simple, you know, did you did you put the glass in the dishwasher correctly or not?</p>
</details>

David George感谢Gavin Baker的分享，并表示每次与他聊天都非常愉快。
