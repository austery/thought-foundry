### OpenAI：下一个万亿美元级巨头

I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company.

我认为OpenAI很可能成为下一个万亿美元级的超大规模公司。

### 回顾一年前的洞察与计算的巨大增长

Over 40% of your revenue today is inference, but inference is about ready because of chain of reasoning. Yeah. Right. It's about to go up by a billion times, by by a million x by a billion. That's right. That's the part that most people have, you know, haven't completely internalized. This is that industry we were talking about. This is the industrial revolution.

你们目前的收入中有超过40%来自推理，但推理即将爆发，因为推理依赖于推理链。没错，它将要增长十亿倍，百万倍乃至十亿倍。没错，这是大多数人尚未完全理解的部分。这就是我们讨论的那个行业，这就是工业革命。

Honestly, it's it's felt like you and I have had a continuation of the pod every day since then. You know, in AI time, it's been about a hundred years. I was re-watching the pod recently and the many things that we talked about that stood out. The most the one that that was probably most profound for me was you pounding the table that you know remember at the time there was kind of a slump in terms of pre-training and people were like, "Oh my god, the end of pre-training, right? The end of pre-training. We're not going. We're overbuilding." This is about a year and a half ago. And you said inference isn't going to 100x, a thousandx, it's going to 1 billion x.

说实话，感觉我们俩从上次播客以来每天都在延续这个话题。你知道，在AI时间尺度上，这已经过去大约一百年了。我最近重温了那期播客，我们谈论的许多事情依然突出。对我来说，也许最深刻的是你当时敲着桌子强调：还记得那时候预训练有点停滞，人们当时说：“天哪，预训练要到头了，对吧？预训练要到头了。我们不会再继续了，我们已经过度建设了。”那是大约一年半前的事情了。你说推理不会增长100倍、1000倍，而是会增长10亿倍。

### AI的三大扩展定律

I underestimated. Let me just go on record. I estimated we we now have three scaling laws, right? We have pre-training scaling law. We have post-training scaling law. Post-training is basically like uh AI practicing. Yes, practicing a skill until it gets it right. And so it tries a whole bunch of different ways and and uh in order to do that, yeah, you've got to do inference. So now training and inference are now integrated in reinforcement learning. Really complicated. And so that's called post training. And then the third is inference. The old way of doing inference was one shot, right? But the new way of doing inference, which we appreciate, is thinking. So think before you answer. Yeah. And so now you have three scaling laws. The the longer you think, the better the quality answer you get. While you're thinking, you do research, you go check on some ground truth. And you you learn some things, you think some more, you go learn some more, and then you generate an answer. Don't just generate right off the bat. And so thinking, post-training, pre-training, we now have three scaling laws, not one.

我估计错了。让我明确地说，我们现在有三条扩展定律，对吧？我们有预训练扩展定律，我们有后训练扩展定律。后训练基本上就像是AI在练习。是的，练习一项技能直到它做对为止。它会尝试很多不同的方法，为了做到这一点，你需要进行推理。所以现在训练和推理在强化学习中结合起来了，这非常复杂。这就是所谓的后训练。第三个是推理。过去推理的方式是一次性完成，对吧？但我们欣赏的新推理方式是思考，即先思考再回答。所以现在你有三条扩展定律，你思考得越久，得到的答案质量就越高。在你思考的时候，你会做研究，去核实一些基本事实，你会学到一些东西，然后思考更多，再学习更多，最后生成答案，而不是一蹴而就。因此，思考、后训练、预训练，我们现在有了三条扩展定律，而不是一条。

You knew that last year, but is your level of confidence this year in the inferences going to 1 billion x and where that will take the levels of intelligence is it higher? Are you more confident this year than you were a year ago?

你去年就知道这一点了，但你今年对推理将增长10亿倍以及这将把智能水平带到何处的信心是否更强了？你比一年前更有信心吗？

### AI系统化与多模态的发展

I'm more confident this year and the reason for that is because look at the agent systems now and AI is no longer a language model and AI is a system of language models and they're all running concurrently maybe using tools. Some of us using tools, some of us doing research and yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff and it's all multimodality and look at all the video that's being generated. I mean, it's just crazy stuff. Yeah.

我今年更有信心，原因在于看看现在的智能体系统，AI不再只是一个语言模型，AI是语言模型的系统，它们都在并发运行，也许在使用工具。有些人使用工具，有些人进行研究，是的，还有很多其他方面，而且都是多模态的，看看所有正在生成的视频，我的意思是，那太疯狂了。

### 英伟达与OpenAI的“星门”合作细节

It really brings us to, you know, kind of the seminal moment this week that everybody's talking about the massive deal. You announced a couple days ago with OpenAI Stargate where that you're going to be a preferred partner, invest hundred billion dollars in the company over a period of time. They're going to build 10 gigs and if they used Nvidia for those 10 gigs that could be upwards of 400 billion in revenue to Nvidia. So help us understand you just tell us a little bit about that partnership what it means to you right and why that investment makes so much sense for Nvidia.

这真正把我们带到了本周所有人都在谈论的重大时刻——就是你几天前宣布的与OpenAI“星门”的巨额交易。你将成为优先合作伙伴，在一段时间内向该公司投资一千亿美元。他们将建设10个千兆瓦的数据中心，如果他们为这10个千兆瓦的数据中心都使用英伟达，那可能为英伟达带来高达4000亿美元的收入。所以请告诉我们一些关于这次合作的细节，这对你意味着什么，以及为什么这项投资对英伟达如此有意义。

So first of all that I'll answer that last question first and then I'll come back and present my way through. I think that OpenAI is likely going to be the next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company. Okay.

首先，我先回答最后一个问题，然后我再回顾性地解释。我认为OpenAI很可能成为下一个万亿美元级的超大规模公司。好的。

### 投资逻辑：瞄准下一代超大规模公司

Why do you call it a hyperscale company? Hyperscale like uh like Meta is a hyperscale. Uh Google's a hyperscale. They're going to have consumer and enterprise services and and uh they are very likely going to be the world's next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company. Yes. And I think you would agree with that. I agree. If that's the case, the opportunity to invest before they get there, this is some of the smartest investments we can possibly imagine. And you got to invest in things, you know, right? And it turns out we happen to know this space. And so the opportunity to invest in that, the return on that money is going to be fantastic. So we love the opportunity to invest. We don't have to invest, right? And it's not required for us to invest, but they're giving us the opportunity to invest. Fantastic thing.

你为什么称其为超大规模公司？超大规模就像Meta、谷歌一样。他们将拥有消费者和企业服务，而且他们极有可能是世界上下一家万亿美元级的超大规模公司。是的，我想你也会同意。我同意。如果是这样的话，在他们达到那个阶段之前投资，这是我们所能想象到的最明智的投资之一。你必须投资于某些事物，对吧？而且碰巧我们了解这个领域。因此，投资于此，这些资金的回报将是巨大的。所以我们非常乐意抓住投资机会。我们不必投资，对吧？投资不是我们的义务，但他们给了我们投资的机会。太棒了。

### 合作的三个层面：Azure、OCI与自建基础设施

Now let me start from the beginning. So we're partnering with with OpenAI in several projects. First the first project is the buildout of Microsoft Azure. We're going to continue to do that and that that partnership is going fantastically. We're going we have several years of buildout to do hundreds of billions of dollars of work just to do there. Right. The second is the OCI buildout and uh I think there's some five, six, seven gigawatts that are about to be built out. And so we're working with OCI and OpenAI and and SoftBank to build that out, right? Those projects are contracted. Um we're working on it. Lots of work to do. And then the third the third is CoreWeave, right? And so uh all of CoreWeave 4, I'm talking OpenAI still. Yes. Okay. Everything in the context of OpenAI. And so so the question is what is this new partnership? This this new partnership is about helping OpenAI working partnering with OpenAI to build their own selfbuild AI infrastructure for the first time, right? And so this is us working directly with OpenAI at the chip level, at the software level, at the systems level, at the AI factory level um to help them become a fully operated hyperscale company that I mean this is going to go on for some time. And it's going to supplement it's going to supplement the amount of you know they're going through two exponentials as you know right the first exponential is the number of customers is growing exponentially and the reason for that is the AI is getting better the use case is getting better just about every every application is connected to open now and so they're going through the the usage exponential the second exponential is the computational exponential of every use. Yes. Right. Yes. Instead of just a oneshot inference is now thinking before it answers. Yeah. And so these two exponential is compounding their compute requirements. And so we we got to build out these all these different projects. And so this last one is an additive on top of everything that they've already announced, all the things that we're already working on with them. It's additive on top of that and uh it's going to support the you know this incredible exponential growth.

现在让我从头开始。我们正在与OpenAI在多个项目中合作。第一个项目是微软Azure的数据中心建设。我们将继续做下去，这项合作非常顺利。我们还有好几年的建设工作要做，仅此一项就涉及数千亿美元的工作。第二个是OCI的建设，我认为有五、六、七吉瓦的容量即将建成。我们正与OCI、OpenAI和软银合作进行建设，对吧？这些项目都有合同。我们正在努力，有很多工作要做。然后是第三个，第三个是CoreWeave，对吧？我谈论的都是关于OpenAI的。所以问题是这个新伙伴关系是什么？这个新伙伴关系是关于帮助OpenAI，与OpenAI合作，让他们第一次建立自己的AI基础设施，对吧？这是我们直接与OpenAI在芯片层面、软件层面、系统层面、AI工厂层面合作，帮助他们成为一个完全运营的超大规模公司，这会持续一段时间。它将补充——你知道，他们正在经历两个指数级增长：第一个指数是客户数量呈指数级增长，原因是AI变得更好，用例也变得更好，几乎每一个应用现在都与OpenAI相关，所以他们正在经历使用量的指数增长。第二个指数是每一次使用的计算量指数增长。现在推理不再是一次性的，而是先思考再回答。所以这两个指数正在使他们的计算需求复合增长。因此，我们必须完成所有这些不同的项目。最后一个项目是叠加在他们已经宣布的一切之上，叠加在我们已经与他们合作的所有事情之上，它将支持这种惊人的指数级增长。

### 从外包到自建：OpenAI的超大规模转型

One of the things you said there that's really interesting to me is kind of you know they're going to be high probability multi-trillion dollar company in your mind. I think it's a great investment. At the same time, you know, they're selfbuilding. You're helping them self-build their data centers. So, here to four, they've been outsourcing to Microsoft to build the data center. Now, they want to build full stack factories themselves.

你刚才说的一点非常有趣，你认为他们很有可能成为万亿美元级的公司。我认为这是一项伟大的投资。同时，你知道，他们在自建。你在帮助他们自建数据中心。在此之前，他们一直将数据中心的建设外包给微软。现在，他们想自己建立全栈工厂。

They want to do they want to they want to basically have a relationship with us the way that that Elon and X has relation. Correct. I mean, Elon and Exel built. Exactly. But I think that this is a very big deal when you think when you think about the advantage that Colossus had. Yeah, they're building full stack. That is a hyperscaler because if they don't use the capacity, they could sell it to somebody else. In the same way Stargate, they're building monstrous capacity. They think they'll need to use most of it, but it puts them in a position to sell it to somebody else as well. It sounds very much like AWS or GCP or Azure. That's what you're saying.

他们想要……他们想要基本上与我们建立关系，就像埃隆和X的关系一样。正确。我的意思是，埃隆和Exel已经建立起来了。没错。但我想这对你思考巨型工厂的优势来说是一个非常重大的事件。是的，他们正在建立全栈能力。这是一个超大规模公司，因为如果他们不使用这些容量，他们可以卖给别人。同样的，星门项目正在建设巨大的容量。他们认为他们会用掉大部分，但这也能让他们把多余的容量卖给别人。这听起来很像AWS、GCP或Azure。你是不是在说这个意思？

### 传统超大规模公司的自主权体现

Yeah, I I think they'll likely use it themselves and um just think the case of X, they'll likely use it themselves. Um but they would like to have the the same direct relationship with us, direct working relationship and direct purchasing relationship. Um uh Meta just as with Zuck and Meta has with us uh it's exactly a direct um our relationship with uh between us and Sunund and Google direct our partnership with Satia and Azure direct. Isn't that right? And so they've gotten to a large enough scale that they believe it's time for them to start building these direct relationships. So, I'm delighted to support that and and all of and and Satia knows it and Larry knows it and everybody everybody's aware of what's going on and everybody's very supportive of it.

是的，我认为他们很可能会自己使用。就像X一样，他们很可能会自己使用。但他们希望与我们建立同等的直接关系、直接合作关系和直接采购关系。就像扎克伯格和Meta与我们一样，是完全直接的。我们与苏南德尔和谷歌是直接关系，我们与萨蒂亚和Azure的合作也是直接的。对吧？他们已经达到了足够的规模，认为现在是时候建立这些直接关系了。所以我很高兴支持这一点，萨蒂亚知道，拉里也知道，每个人都知道正在发生什么，而且大家都非常支持。

### 华尔街对英伟达增长预期的分歧

So, one of the things I find mysterious, right? You know, you just mentioned Oracle 300 billion Colossus what they're building. We know what the sovereigns are building. We know what the hyperscalers are building. You know, Sam's talking in terms of trillions. But of the 25 sell-side analysts on Wall Street who cover your stock, if I look at the consensus estimate, it basically has your growth flatlining starting in 2027. 8% growth 2027 through 2030. Okay, that is the 25 people in their only job. They get paid to forecast the growth rate for Nvidia. So clearly we're comfortable with that by the way. Right. Look, we're comfortable with that. Okay, we have no trouble beating the numbers on a regular basis, right? No, I understand that. But, but there is this interesting disconnect. No, right. I hear it every day on CNBC and Bloomberg.

我发现一个奇怪的现象，对吧？你刚才提到了Oracle的3000亿，Colossus正在建造的。我们知道主权国家在做什么，我们知道超大规模公司在做什么。你知道，Sam谈论的是万亿级别。但在华尔街覆盖你股票的25位卖方分析师中，如果我看一下共识估计，它基本上显示你的增长从2027年开始趋于平稳，2027年至2030年仅增长8%。好吧，这是那25个人的唯一工作，他们靠预测英伟达的增长率拿薪水。所以很明显，顺便说一句，我们对这个数字很满意。对，我们对此很满意。我们定期超越这些数字没有问题，对吧？不，我理解。但是，确实存在这种有趣的脱节。不，我每天在CNBC和彭博社都能听到。

### 解释分歧：物理定律驱动的计算范式转移

And I think it goes to, you know, some of these questions around, you know, uh, shortages leading to a glut that they don't believe. They say, "Okay, we'll give you credit for 26, but 27, you know, maybe we'll have too much and you're not going to need that." But it is interesting to me and I think it's important to point out that the your consensus forecast is that this won't happen right and we also put together forecast uh you know for the company taking into account all of these numbers and what it shows me is still even though we're two and a half years into the age of AI a massive divergence of belief between what we hear Sam Alman saying you saying Sundar saying Satcha is saying and what Wall Street still believes and you know again you're comfortable with that.

我认为这与一些关于短缺导致供应过剩的问题有关，他们不相信这一点。他们说：“好吧，我们承认2026年的情况，但2027年，你知道，也许我们会供过于求，你就不需要那么多了。”但我认为很有趣，而且重要的是要指出，你们的共识预测是这种情况不会发生，对吧？我们还为公司做了一个预测，考虑了所有这些数字，它向我表明，尽管我们已经进入AI时代两年半了，但在我们听到的Sam Altman、你、Sundar、Satya所说的，以及华尔街仍然相信的观点之间，存在着巨大的分歧，而你又对这种情况感到满意。

I also don't think it's inconsistent. Okay. So explain that a little bit. So first of all uh for the builders we're supposed to be building for opportunity right? We're we're builders. Let me give you three points to think through and and and these three points uh it'll help you um hopefully uh be more comfortable with Nvidia in this future. So the first point and this is the laws of physics point. This is the most important point that general purpose computing is over and the future is accelerated computing and AI computing. That's the first point.

我也认为这并不矛盾。好的，请解释一下。首先，对于建设者来说，我们应该为机会而建设，对吧？我们是建设者。我给你三个要点来思考，这三点希望能帮助你对英伟达的未来更加放心。第一点是物理定律，这是最重要的一点：通用计算已经结束，未来是加速计算和AI计算。这是第一点。

### 计算基础设施的更新换代

And so the way to think about that is there's how much how many trillions of dollars of computing infrastructures in the world that has to be refreshed. Right. Right. And when it gets refreshed it's going to be accelerated comput. That's right. And so the first thing you have to realize is that general purpose computing and nobody disputes that. Everybody goes, "Yeah, we completely agree with that. General purpose computing is over. Moore's law is dead." People say these things. And so what does that mean? So general purpose computing is going to go to accelerated computing. Our partnership with Intel is recognizing that general purpose computing needs to be fused with accelerated computing to create opportunities for them. Is that right? And so one, general purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing and AI. Two, the first use case of AI is actually already everywhere, right? It's in search recommender engines, isn't that right? In shopping. The basic hyperscale computing infrastructure used to be CPUs doing recommenders, right? Is now going to GPUs doing AI, right? So you just take classical computing, it's going to accelerated computing AI. You take hyperscale computing is going from CPUs to accelerated computing and AI and then now that's the second point just feeding the metas the Googles the bite dances the Amazons and take their classical traditional way of doing hyperscaling and moving into AI that's hundreds of billions of dollars and and because that may be four billion people on the planet today if you take Tik Tok meta into account that's Google into account who are already demanding workloads that are driven by accelerated comput. That's exactly right. And so there a simp without even thinking about AI creating new opportunities. It's about AI shifting how you used to do something to the way new way of doing something. Okay.

思考这一点的方式是，世界上有多少万亿美元的计算基础设施需要更新换代？对。对，当它更新换代时，将是加速计算。没错。所以你首先要认识到，通用计算……没有人对此有争议。每个人都说：“是的，我们完全同意，通用计算结束了，摩尔定律死了。”人们就是这样说的。那这意味着什么？通用计算将转向加速计算。我们与英特尔的合作正是认识到通用计算需要与加速计算融合，从而为他们创造机会。对吧？所以第一点，通用计算正在转向加速计算和AI。第二点，AI的第一个用例实际上已经无处不在了，对吧？它存在于搜索推荐引擎中，不是吗？在购物中。过去超大规模计算基础设施是CPU做推荐，对吧？现在将是GPU做AI，对吧？所以你只需要看传统计算如何转向加速计算和AI。你再看超大规模计算如何从CPU转向加速计算和AI，这就是第二点，仅仅是满足Meta、Google、字节跳动、Amazon等公司，将他们传统的超大规模扩展方式转向AI，这涉及数千亿美元。而且，如果考虑到TikTok、Meta和Google，今天地球上可能有40亿人，他们已经在要求由加速计算驱动的工作负载了。这完全正确。所以，这不仅仅是关于AI创造新机会，更是关于AI改变了你过去做某事的方式，转变为一种新的做事方式。好的。

### AI带来的全新应用与生产力革命

And then now let's talk about the future. I just so far I've only spoken kind of largely about just mundane stuff. Just mundane stuff. The old way is now wrong. You're going to go, you're no longer going to use uh uh fuel light lanterns. You're going to go to electricity. That's all. Right. Okay. And you no longer, you know, prop planes. You're going to go to jets. That's all. And so, you know, so far, you know, that's all I've talked about. And then now that the incredible thing is when you go to AI, when you go to accelerated computing, then what happens? What are the new applications that emerge as a result? And that's all the AI stuff that we're talking about. And that's the that opportunity. What is it? How do what does that look like? Well, the simple way of thinking about that is where motors replace labor and physical activity. We now have AI. These AI supercomputers, these AI factories that I talk about, they're going to generate tokens to augment human intelligence, right? And human intelligence represents what 55 65% of the world's GDP. Let's call it $50 trillion. And that $50 trillion is going to get augmented by something. And so let's you just let's come back to a single person. Suppose I were to hire a $100,000 employee. And I augmented that $100,000 employee with a $10,000 AI. Yes. And that $10,000 AI as a result made that $100,000 employee twice more productive, three times more productive. Would I do it? Heartbeat. I'm doing it across every single person in our company right now. Right. Every single co-agents. That's right. Every That's right. Every single software engineer, every single chip designer in our company already has AIS working with them. 100% coverage. As a result, the number of chips we're building is better. The number is growing. The pace at which we're doing it is right. And so we're we're growing faster as a company. As a result, we're hiring more people. Our productivity is greater. Our top line's greater. Our profitability is greater. What's not to love about that? Now apply the Nvidia story to the world's GDP. Yeah. And so what's likely to happen is that that $50 trillion is augmented by let's pick a number 10 trillion that $10 trillion needs to run on a machine. M now the reason that AI is different than it in the past in a way software was written a priori and then it runs on a CPU and it doesn't it runs it a a person would operate it in the future of course AI is generating tokens but a machine has to generate the tokens and it's thinking so that software is running all the time whereas in the past the software was written once now the software is in fact writing all the time it's thinking in order for the AI to think it needs a factory. And so let's say that that 10 trillion of token generated 50% gross margins and 5 trillion of it needs a factory needs an AI infrastructure. So if you told me that on an annual basis the capex of the world was about $5 trillion I would say the math seems to make sense. Yeah. And that's kind of the future, right? Yeah. the going from Excel general purpose computing to accelerated computing replacing all the hyperscales with AI and then now augmenting human intelligence for the world's GDP and today that market is about our estimate is about 400 billion annually. Yeah. So the the TAM you know is is a four to 5x increase over where it is today.

然后我们来谈谈未来。到目前为止，我主要谈论的都是一些日常事务。旧的方式已经过时了。你不会再使用燃油灯，你会使用电力，仅此而已。你不会再使用螺旋桨飞机，你会使用喷气式飞机，仅此而已。所以，到目前为止，我谈论的都是这些。现在，令人难以置信的是，当我们谈论AI、谈论加速计算时，会发生什么？作为结果，会出现哪些新的应用？这就是我们讨论的所有AI内容，这就是那个机会。它是什么？它看起来像什么？思考它的简单方式是：机器取代劳动和体力活动的地方。我们现在有了AI。我所说的这些AI超级计算机、这些AI工厂，它们将生成Token来增强人类智能，对吧？人类智能约占世界GDP的55%到65%，我们称之为50万亿美元。这50万亿美元将被某种东西所增强。所以我们回到一个人。假设我雇佣一个年薪10万美元的员工。我用一个价值1万美元的AI来增强这个10万美元的员工。结果是，这个1万美元的AI让这个10万美元的员工的生产力提高了两倍、三倍。我会这样做吗？毫不犹豫。我现在正在我们公司的每一个人身上都这样做。对的，每个智能体。没错。我们公司的每一个软件工程师，每一个芯片设计师都已经有了AI在他们身边工作。100%覆盖。结果是，我们构建的芯片数量更多了，数量在增长，我们完成的速度也很快。所以我们公司发展得更快了。因此，我们雇佣更多的人，我们的生产力更高，我们的收入更高，我们的盈利能力更强。有什么不喜欢的呢？现在将英伟达的故事应用到全球GDP上。因此，很可能会发生的是，那50万亿美元被我们假设的10万亿美元所增强。这10万亿美元需要在机器上运行。现在AI与过去不同的一点是，过去软件是先验编写的，然后在CPU上运行，它不是由人来操作的。未来，AI会生成Token，但机器必须生成Token，而且它在思考，所以这个软件一直在运行，而过去软件只写一次。现在软件本身一直在写，它在思考。为了让AI思考，它需要一个工厂。所以，假设那10万亿美元的Token生成，以50%的毛利率计算，其中5万亿美元需要一个工厂，需要一个AI基础设施。所以，如果你告诉我，世界上每年的资本支出约为5万亿美元，我会认为这个数学是说得通的。这就是未来，对吧？通用计算转向加速计算，用AI取代所有超大规模计算，然后增强全球GDP的人类智能。今天这个市场，据我们估计，每年约为4000亿美元。所以，总潜在市场比今天的规模增长了4到5倍。

### 计算需求的指数级增长与英伟达的关联性

Yeah. Eddie last night, Eddie Woo at Alibaba said between now and the end of the year and excuse me, now and the end of the decade, they're going to increase their data center power by 10x. Right. Right. You just said how much? 4x. There you go. There you go. Yeah. They're going to increase power by 10x. And we we correlate to power. Nvidia's revenue is almost correlated to power. Isn't that right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Because one other thing, what he what else did he say? Yeah. He said token generation is doubling every few months. Yeah. What's that saying? The the perf per watt has to keep on going exponentially. That's why Nvidia's like cranking it out with perf per watt. And revenue per watt is, you know, watt is basically revenues in this future.

是的。昨晚，阿里巴巴的Eddie Woo说，从现在到年底……抱歉，从现在到十年底，他们将把数据中心的电力消耗增加10倍。对。你刚才说了多少？4倍。就是这样。他们要将电力增加10倍。而我们的收入几乎与电力相关。对吧？是的，没错。因为他说的另一件事是，他说Token生成速度每隔几个月就会翻一番。那这句话说明了什么？每瓦性能必须保持指数级增长。这就是为什么英伟达要靠每瓦性能来推动增长。在这个未来，每瓦收入……你知道，瓦特基本上就是收入。

### 经济增长的新驱动力：AI作为数十万亿级劳动力

Embedded in this assumption, I find it very fascinating historical context, right? For 2,000 years, basically GDP did not grow. Okay? And then we get the industrial revolution, GDP accelerates. We get the digital revolution, GDP accelerates. And it basically what you're saying, and Scott Besson has said it, he said, I think we're going to have 4% GDP growth next year. Basically, what you're saying is the world's GDP growth is going to accelerate because now we are giving the world billions of co-workers that will do work for us. And if GDP is an amount of output for a fixed amount of labor and capital, right, it has to accelerate. It has to, right? It has to look at what's going on with AI as a result of the technology of AI. And that technology of AI, let's just call it the large language models and all the AI agents. It's now creating a new industry of AI agents. There's no question about that. Okay. So, so that's OpenAI is the fastest growing revenue company in history, right? and they're growing exponentially, right? And so, so AI itself is a fast growing industry because of AI needs a factory behind it, right? An infrastructure behind it. There's this industry is growing. My industry is growing. And because my industry is growing, the industry underneath it is growing. Energy is growing. Power shell. This is the this is like renaissance for the energy industry, isn't that right? Nuclear energy, you know, gas turbines. I mean, look at all of those companies in the in the infrastructure ecosystem underneath us. They're doing incredibly well.

在这个假设中，我发现了一个非常引人入胜的历史背景，对吧？大约2000年来，GDP基本上没有增长。然后我们迎来了工业革命，GDP加速了。我们迎来了数字革命，GDP也加速了。你基本上在说，斯科特·贝森也说过，他说我认为明年我们将实现4%的GDP增长。基本上，你的意思是，世界GDP增长将会加速，因为我们现在正在为世界提供数十亿的“协同工作者”来为我们工作。如果GDP是固定劳动力和资本的产出量，对吧？它必须加速。它必须加速。看看AI技术带来的变化。这种AI技术，我们称之为大型语言模型和所有AI代理，它现在正在创造一个全新的AI代理行业，这一点毫无疑问。OpenAI是历史上收入增长最快的公司，对吧？而且他们的增长是指数级的，对吧？所以AI本身就是一个快速增长的行业，因为它需要背后的工厂，需要基础设施。这个行业正在增长。我的行业也在增长。由于我的行业在增长，其下层的行业也在增长。能源在增长，电力是。这对能源行业来说就像一场文艺复兴，不是吗？核能，你知道，燃气轮机。看看我们下面的基础设施生态系统中的所有那些公司，它们都做得非常好。

### 对“供应过剩泡沫”论的驳斥

Everybody's growing. These numbers have everybody talking about a glut bubble, right? Zuckerberg said last week on a podcast, you know, he said, "Listen, I think it's quite possible at some point that we will have an air pocket and Meta may in fact overspend by $10 billion or whatever," but he said it doesn't matter. It's so existential to the future of his business that it's a risk that they have to take. But when you think about that, it sounds a little bit like prisoners dilemma. Right. And walk us again through these are very happy prisoners. Walk us again through Right. Today our estimate is that we're going to have a 100 billion of AI revenue in 2026 excluding meta and excluding you know the GPUs running recommender engines. Okay. So there's or search or correct. So there there's other stuff but let's call it 100 billion.

每个人都在增长。这些数字让每个人都在谈论供应过剩的泡沫，对吧？扎克伯格上周在一个播客中说：“听着，我认为很有可能在某个时候会出现一个气泡，Meta可能会多花100亿美元或多少，但这没关系。这对他们业务的未来太重要了，这是他们必须承担的风险。”但当你想到这一点时，它听起来有点像囚徒困境，对吧？带我们回顾一下……这些都是非常开心的囚徒。今天我们的估计是，到2026年，我们的AI收入将达到1000亿美元，不包括Meta，也不包括……你知道的，那些运行推荐引擎的GPU。好吧，还有搜索或……没错。所以还有其他的东西，但我们称之为1000亿美元。

### AI驱动收入的现状与未来预测

What is that industry anyways? What is the industry already in hyperscale? What is the hyperscales you know between trillions? Yeah exactly by the way that industry is going to AI before anybody starts at zero. You got to start there. But I think the skeptics would say we need to go from a 100red billion of AI revenue in 26 to at least a trillion of AI revenue in 2030. Okay. You just were talking a minute ago about five trillion when you look at kind of global GDP. If you do did a bottoms up, can you see your way to a trillion dollars of AI driven revenues from a hundred billion over the course of the next 5 years? Are we growing that fast? Yes. And I would also say we're already there. Okay. So explain that. Because the hyperscalers, they went from CPUs to AI. Okay. Their entire revenue base is all now AI driven. Correct. Uh you can't do Tik Tok without AI. Correct. You can't do YouTube short without AI. You can't you know you can't do any of this stuff without AI. Uh the the amazing things that that Meta is doing for for uh um uh you know customized content, personalized content. You can't do that without AI. It's all of that stuff used to be humans, you know, doing uh content a priori creating four choices that are then selected by a recommender engine. Correct. And now it's infinite number of choices generated by an AI, right? But those things are already like we had the transition from CPUs to GPUs largely for those recommender engines and now they're going and that's fairly new I would in the last three or four years. Zuck would tell you I was at Siggraph and Zuck would tell you you know they were late getting to GPU for sure for sure. GPUs for for meta is what couple years and a half it's pretty new search with GPUs for sure brand spanking new for sure for sure search for GPUs on GPUs.

那个行业到底是什么？超大规模领域中已经存在什么样的行业？你知道，在万亿级别中，超大规模行业是什么？顺便说一句，那个行业在任何人从零开始之前就已经转向AI了。你必须从那里开始。但我认为怀疑论者会说，我们需要从2026年1000亿美元的AI收入增长到2030年至少1万亿美元的AI收入。好吧，你刚才谈到全球GDP的五万亿。如果你自下而上地看，你能在未来5年内，从1000亿美元看到通往1万亿美元AI驱动收入的路径吗？我们增长那么快吗？是的。而且我还会说，我们已经达到了。好的，请解释一下。因为超大规模公司，它们已经从CPU转向了AI。好吧，它们整个收入基础现在都由AI驱动。正确。没有AI你就做不了TikTok。正确。没有AI你就做不了YouTube Shorts。你知道的，没有AI你就做不了这些事情。Meta在定制内容、个性化内容方面所做的惊人事情，没有AI是做不到的。所有这些东西以前都是人类先验地创建四种选择，然后由推荐引擎来选择。正确。而现在是AI生成的无限数量的选择，对吧？但这些事情已经……我们主要是在过去三四年中，才为这些推荐引擎完成了从CPU到GPU的过渡。扎克伯格会告诉你，我参加了Siggraph，扎克伯格会告诉你，他们肯定在转向GPU方面很迟钝。GPU对Meta来说是很新的，大概两年半以前。搜索使用GPU，当然是全新的。

### 从一次性推理到思考型AI的计算需求激增

So your argument would be the probability that we're going to have a trillion dollars of AI revenues by 2030 is near certain because we're almost already there. Okay, let's just talk about incremental from where we are. Now we can talk about incremental from where we are today, right? As you do your bottoms up or your tops down, I just heard your tops down about percentage of global GDP. Yeah. What is the percentage probability that you think we'll have a glut will run into a glut in the next three or four or five years?

所以你的论点是，到2030年实现万亿美元AI收入的可能性几乎是确定的，因为我们几乎已经到了那里。好的，我们来谈谈相对于我们现在的增量。我们现在可以谈谈相对于我们今天的增量，对吧？就像你做自下而上或自上而下的分析一样，我刚才听到了你关于全球GDP百分比的自上而下的看法。那么，你认为在未来三、四年或五年内出现供应过剩的概率是多少？

It's a distribution of we don't know the future. It's a distribution of power until until we fully convert all general purpose computing to accelerated computing and AI. Until we do that, yes, I think the chances are extremely low. Okay. Okay. And that will take a few years. That'll take a few years. Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask one more and then until all recommender engines are AI based. until all content generation is AI based because content generation consumer oriented content generation is very largely recommender systems and so on so forth um and all of that's going to be AI generated until until all of the stuff what classically was hyperscale now transitions to AI you know everything from shopping to e-commerce to you know all that stuff until everything goes over.

这是一个概率分布，我们不知道未来。这是一个能力分布，直到我们完全将所有通用计算转换为加速计算和AI。在我们完成之前，我认为几率极低。好的。这需要几年时间。是的。让我再问一个，直到所有推荐引擎都基于AI，直到所有内容生成都基于AI，因为面向消费者的内容生成很大程度上是推荐系统等，所有这些都将是AI生成的，直到所有传统上属于超大规模计算的东西过渡到AI，从购物到电子商务，直到所有这些都转换过来。

### 投资的必要性与供应链的准备就绪

because but all this new build right when we're talking about trillions. We're investing ahead of where we are. Um, you know, is that like at will? Are you obliged to invest the money even if you see a slowdown or a kind of a glut coming or is this one of these things that you're just waving the flag to the ecosystem to say get out and build and at some point in time if we see some of this slow down, we can always pull back on the level of investment. Actually, it's the other way because we're at the end of the supply chain, right? And so, we respond to demand. Okay? And right now all the VCs will tell you and you guys know the demand the short there's a shortage of compute in the world not because there's a shortage of GPUs in the world. Okay, if they give me an order I'll build it. Right. We've over the last couple years we've really plumbed the supply chain. So all of the supply chain behind me from wafer starts to co-ass HBM memories you know all of that technology. We've really geared up. Yeah. If we need to double we'll double. Yes. Okay. So the supply chain is ready. Now we're just waiting for demand signals and when when uh the the CSPs and the hyperscalers and our customers uh do their annual plan and they give us you know their forecast um we respond to that and we build to that.

但所有这些新的建设，当我们谈论万亿美元时，我们是在超前于我们目前的水平进行投资。你知道，这是否是随心所欲的？即使你看到放缓或供应过剩，你也有义务投资这些钱吗？还是说你只是向生态系统发出信号，让大家出去建设，并且如果看到放缓，我们可以随时缩减投资规模？实际上是反过来的，因为我们在供应链的末端，对吧？所以我们对需求做出反应。对吧？现在所有风险投资人都告诉你，而且你们也知道，市场……世界上计算资源短缺，不是因为世界上GPU短缺。好的，如果他们给我一个订单，我就会建造。在过去的几年里，我们真正深入了解了供应链。所以我背后的所有供应链，从晶圆启动到CoWoS、HBM内存，你知道所有这些技术，我们已经准备就绪。是的。如果我们必须翻倍，我们就会翻倍。好的。所以供应链已经准备好了。现在我们只需要等待需求信号，当云服务提供商、超大规模公司和我们的客户制定年度计划并向我们提供他们的预测时，我们会对此做出回应并进行建设。

### 客户需求预测的持续上调

Now what's what's going on of course is that every one of their forecasts that they provide us turns out to have been wrong right because they under forecasted and so now we're always in a scramble mode. Mhm. And so we've been in the scramble mode now for you know a couple of years and it's whatever forecast we've been given has been always significant increase from last year but not not enough.

现在发生的情况是，他们向我们提供的每一个预测结果都被证明是错误的，对吧？因为他们低估了需求。所以我们现在总是在争抢状态下。Mhm。所以我们已经处于这种争抢状态好几年了，无论我们得到的预测是什么，都比去年有显著增加，但仍然不够。

### 传统超大规模公司的追赶步伐

Satya last year seemed to be pulling back a little bit. You know seemed to be you know some people called him the adult in the room tamping down kind of some of these these expectations. A few weeks ago he said hey I've also built two gigs this year and we're going to accelerate in the future. Do you see some of the traditional hyperscalers that may have been moving a little slower than let's call it a CoreWeave or or Elon X or maybe a little slower than Stargate? Do you see them all? It it sounds like to me they're all leaning in more now and they're all also because of the second exponential.

去年萨蒂亚似乎有所收敛。你知道，有些人称他为“房间里的成年人”，在压低这些预期。几周前他说：“嘿，我今年也建了两个数据中心，我们将来会加速。”你是否看到一些传统超大规模公司，他们可能比CoreWeave或Elon X，或者比星门项目行动得慢一些？我感觉他们现在都在加倍投入，而且这也是因为第二个指数级增长。

We've already had one exponential we were experiencing which was the adoption rate of AI, the engagement of AI was growing exponentially. Yes. The second exponential that kicked in was reasoning. Yeah. That was the conversation we had one year ago. One year ago. Yeah. We said, "Hey, listen. The moment you take AI from one shot, memorizing an answer and Right. Memorizing and generalizing, that's basically pre-training." Yeah. So memorizing an answer, you know, what's 8*8? Just memorize it. Okay. And so memorizing an answer and generalizing, that was one shot AI. Now a year ago, reasoning came about for sure research came about, tool use came about, and now you're a thinking AI 1 billion X. It's going to use a lot more compute.

我们已经经历了一个指数级增长，那就是AI的采用率和参与度在呈指数级增长。是的。第二个启动的指数级增长是推理。是的。这就是我们一年前的对话。一年前。是的。我们说：“嘿，听着。当你把AI从一次性、记住答案，记住并泛化（这基本上是预训练）的阶段，

Certain hyperscale customers to your point had internal workloads that they had to migrate anyways from um from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. So they built through the cycle. I think maybe some hyperscalers had different workloads so they weren't quite sure how quickly they could digest it but everyone has now concluded that they dramatically underbuilt.

根据你的观点，一些超大规模客户不得不将其内部工作负载从通用计算迁移到加速计算。所以他们经历了这个周期。我想也许一些超大规模公司有不同的工作负载，所以他们不确定能多快消化它，但现在所有人都得出了结论：他们严重低估了建设规模。

### 加速数据处理：CPU的下一个重要市场

One of the applications that my favorite is just good old fashioned data processing structured data and unstructured data. Just good old fashioned data processing. And very soon we're going to announce a very big initiative of accelerated data processing. M data processing represents the vast majority of the world's CPUs today. It still completely runs on CPUs. You know, if you go to data bricks, it's mostly CPUs. You go to snowflakes, mostly CPUs. Uh SQL processing at Oracle, mostly CPUs. Everybody's using CPUs to do SQL structured data. In the future, that's all going to move to AI data. That is one gigantic massive market that we're going to move to. But you need you need a you need everything that Nvidia does requires acceleration layers and requires you know domain specific right data processing lies recipes we got to go build that but that's coming.

我最喜欢的一个应用就是老式的、传统的结构化和非结构化数据处理。很快我们将宣布一项重大的加速数据处理计划。数据处理代表了当今世界上绝大多数CPU的使用。它仍然完全运行在CPU上。你知道，如果你去DataBricks，主要是CPU。你去Snowflake，主要是CPU。Oracle的SQL处理，主要是CPU。每个人都在用CPU处理SQL结构化数据。未来，这一切都将转向AI数据。这是一个巨大且庞大的市场，我们将转向这个市场。但英伟达所做的一切都需要加速层，需要特定领域的……对，数据处理需要食谱，我们得去构建它，但那即将到来。

### 关于“循环收入”的批评与英伟达的投资逻辑

so one of the push backs I you know I turned on CNBC yesterday they were like oh glut bubble when I turned on Bloomberg it was about roundtripping and circular revenues okay and so for the benefit of people you know at home know these arrangements are when companies enter into a misleading transaction that artificially inflates revenue without any underlying economic substance. So in other words, growth propped up by financial engineering, not by customer demand. And the canonical case everybody's referencing of course is Cisco and Nortell from the last bubble 25 years ago. So when you guys or Microsoft or Amazon are investing in companies that are also your big customers, in this case you guys investing in Open AI while Open AI is buying tens of billions of chips, just remind us and remind everybody else like what is it what are the analysts on Bloomberg and otherwise getting wrong when they're hyperventilating about circular revenues or about roundtripping?

所以，我收到的一些反对意见是，我昨天打开CNBC，他们说“哦，供应过剩泡沫”；当我打开彭博社时，他们谈论的是“回流交易”和“循环收入”，对吧？为了让家里的朋友们了解，这些安排是指公司进行误导性交易，在没有根本经济实质的情况下人为地夸大收入。换句话说，增长是由金融工程支撑的，而不是由客户需求支撑的。大家引用的典型案例当然是25年前Cisco和Nortel的案例。所以，当你们、微软或亚马逊投资那些同时也是你们大客户的公司时——在本例中，你们投资OpenAI，而OpenAI正在购买数百亿美元的芯片——请提醒我们，提醒大家，彭博社及其他机构的分析师们在对循环收入或回流交易反应过度时，到底错在哪里？

### 投资回报与合作的本质

10 gigawatts is like $400 billion, right? Something like that. and and that $400 billion dollars will have to be largely funded by their offtake, right? Their revenue which is growing exponentially. It has to be funded by their capital, the money they've raised through equity and whatever debt they can raise. Those are the three vehicles. And the equity that they could raise and the debt that they could raise has something to do with the confidence of the revenues that they could sustain for sure. And so smart investors and smart lenders will consider all of these factors. Fundamentally, that's what they're going to do. That's their company. It's not my business. And of course, we have to stay very close to them to make sure that we build in support of their continued growth. Okay? And so, um, there's the revenue side of it and has nothing to do with the investment side of it. The investment side of it is not tied to anything. It's an opportunity to invest in them. And as we were mentioning earlier, this is likely going to be the next multi-trillion dollar hyperscale company. And who doesn't want to be an investor in that? You know, my only regret is that that they invited us to invest early on.

10吉瓦大约是4000亿美元，对吧？大概是这样。而这4000亿美元大部分将由他们的承购量，对吧？他们指数级增长的收入来提供资金。它必须由他们的资本来资助，即他们通过股权和他们能筹集的任何债务筹集的资金。这是三种方式。他们能筹集的股权和债务，与他们能维持的收入信心有关，这当然是这样。所以聪明的投资者和聪明的贷方会考虑所有这些因素。从根本上说，他们会这么做。那是他们的公司，不是我的业务。当然，我们必须与他们保持密切联系，确保我们为他们持续的增长提供支持。好的？所以，收入方面与投资方面无关。投资方面与任何事情都没有关系，这是一个投资于他们的机会。正如我们前面提到的，这很可能成为下一个万亿美元级的超大规模公司。谁不想成为其中的投资者呢？我的唯一遗憾是他们邀请我们这么早投资。

### 英伟达在AI生态中的地位与投资策略

I remember those conversations and we were so poor, you know, that we were so poor, we didn't invest enough, you know, and I should have given them all my money. And the reality is if you guys don't do your jobs and keep up with, you know, if if Ver Rubin doesn't turn into a good chip, they can go get other chips and put them in these data centers, right? There's no obligation that they have to use your chips and and like you said, you're you're looking at this as an opportunistic equity investment. The other thing I would say and we've made some great investments. I got to put it out there, you know, we invested in XAI, we invested in Coreweave. Incredible. Yeah. Yeah. How smart was that? Yeah. As I go back to this, the other fundamental thing it seems to me is, you know, you're putting it out there. You're saying this is what we're doing. And the underlying economic substance here, right? It's not that you're just somehow sending revenues back and forth between the two companies. We got people sending money every month for Chat GPT, a billion and a half monthly users using the product. You just said every enterprise in the world is either going to do this or they will die. Every sovereign views this as existential to their national security and economic security as as nuclear power. What person, company or nation says intelligence is bas basically optional for yeah for us. I mean it's fundamental to them.

我记得那些谈话，我们当时太穷了，你知道，我们太穷了，投资得不够，你知道，我应该把所有的钱都给他们。现实情况是，如果你们没有做好自己的工作跟上进度，如果Ver Rubin做不出好的芯片，他们可以去弄其他芯片放到这些数据中心里，对吧？他们没有义务必须使用你们的芯片。正如你所说，你正将此视为一个机会性的股权投资。我要说的另一件事是，我们做了一些很棒的投资，比如我们投资了XAI，投资了CoreWeave。太棒了。是啊。那多聪明。回到这一点，对我来说似乎另一个根本性的观点是，你在把事情公之于众，你在说这就是我们在做的。这里的根本经济实质，对吧？不是说你们在两家公司之间来回转移收入。我们有用户每月为ChatGPT支付费用，每月有15亿用户在使用该产品。你刚才说，世界上每一个企业，要么这样做，要么就会消亡。每个主权国家都认为这对他们的国家安全和经济安全来说是生死攸关的问题，就像核能一样。什么样的人、公司或国家会认为智能对我们来说基本上是可有可无的？在我看来，这对他们来说是根本性的。

### 英伟达的年度发布周期与“极端代码设计”

Well the automation of intelligence I beat the demand question to death. So let's jump in a little bit to system design and I'm I'm I'm going to turn to Clark here in a sec second on that. But in 2024, you switched to your annual release cycle, right with Hopper. You then had a massive upgrade which required, you know, significant data center overhaul with Grace Blackwell. In 2025, and in the back half of 26, we're going to get Vera Rubin. 27 we'll get Ultra and 28 Fineman. How is the annual release cycle going? Okay. What were the main goals of going to an annual release cycle? And did AI inside Nvidia allow you to execute the annual release cycle?

好吧，智能的自动化……我对需求问题的讨论已经够多了。所以我们来谈谈系统设计，我马上要请Clark来谈谈。但在2024年，你转向了年度发布周期，对吧？有了Hopper。然后你进行了大规模升级，这需要用Grace Blackwell对数据中心进行重大改造。2025年，2026年下半年，我们将迎来Vera Rubin。2027年是Ultra，2028年是Fineman。年度发布周期进展如何？目标是什么？英伟达内部的AI是否允许你执行年度发布周期？

Yeah, the answer is yes. On the back on the last question, without it, um, Nvidia's velocity, our pace, our scale would be limited. And so without without AI these days, um, it's just simply not possible to build what we built. Now, um, why do we do it? There's something that remember uh uh Eddie said it uh at his earnings call um or his conference. Uh Satia has said it, Sam has said it. The token generation rate is going up exponentially. Yeah. And the customer use is going up exponentially. Um I think they're at 800 million weekly active users or something like that. Yes. I mean that's less than two years from chat GPT, right? And each of those users is generating massively more tokens because they're using inference time reasoning. That's right. Exactly. And so so the first thing is because the token generation rate is going up so incredibly two exponentials. Yeah. On top of each other, we have to un unless we increase the performance at incredible rates, the cost of token generation will keep growing because Mo's law is dead, right? Because transistors basically cost the same every single year now. And power is largely the same. And between those two fundamental laws, unless we come up with new technologies to drive the cost down, even if there's a slight difference in growth, you give somebody a discount of a few percent. How's that going to make up for two exponentials? And so we have to increase our per performance annually at a pace that keeps up with that exponential.

是的，答案是肯定的。关于上一个问题，没有AI，英伟达的速度、我们的步伐、我们的规模都会受到限制。所以没有AI，现在……简直不可能建造我们所建造的。我们为什么要这样做？还记得Eddie在财报电话会议上说的话，萨蒂亚和Sam都说过，Token的生成速度正在呈指数级增长。是的。客户的使用量也在呈指数级增长。我想他们每周活跃用户达到了8亿左右。是的。这意味着ChatGPT推出还不到两年，对吧？而且每个用户生成的Token量都大大增加，因为他们正在使用推理时间的推理。没错，完全正确。所以第一点是，因为Token的生成速度如此惊人地增长，两个指数级增长叠加在一起，除非我们以惊人的速度提高性能，否则Token生成的成本将持续增长，因为摩尔定律已经死了，对吧？因为晶体管每年成本基本上是一样的，功耗也基本相同。在这两条基本定律之间，除非我们拿出新技术来降低成本，即使增长有一点点差异，你给别人打个几分的折扣，这怎么能抵消两个指数级增长呢？所以我们必须每年以跟上这种指数增长的速度来提高我们的性能。

### 极致的系统级协同设计

Yeah. So in the case of in the case of um uh going from uh uh Kepler to yeah all the way to Kepler all the way to um uh Hopper was probably 100,000x that was the beginning of the AI journey for Nvidia. 100,000x in 10 years. Okay. Between Hopper and Blackwell, we increased because of MVLink 72, right? 30x in one year and then we'll get another X factor again with Reuben and then we'll get another X factor with Fineman. And the way we we do that is because the transistors aren't really helping us very much, right? Moors law is largely the density is growing up but going up but the performance is not. And so if that's the case, one of the challenges that we have to do is we have to break the entire problem down at the system level and change every chip at the same time and all the software stack and all the systems all at the same time. The ultimate extreme code design. Nobody's ever codees at this level before, right? We change the CPU, revolutionize the CPU, a GPU, the networking chip, the MVLink scale up, the Spectrum X scale out. Somebody said I heard somebody said, "Oh yeah, it's just Ethernet." Yeah. Right. Okay. So, Spectrum X Ethernet is not just Ethernet. And people are starting to discover, oh my god, the X factors is pretty incredible, right? You know, Nvidia's Ethernet business, the just Ethernet business is the fastest growing Ethernet business in the world. Yeah. And so, so scale out and of course now we have to uh build even larger systems. So, we scale across um multiple AI factories connected together. And then we do this at an annual pace. And so we now have an exponential of exponentials going ourselves from technology. And that allows our customers to drive the cost of tokens down, keep making those tokens smarter and smarter with pre-training and post-training and thinking. And as a result, when the AI gets smarter, they get more used. When they get more used, they're going to grow exponentially.

是的。所以在从Kepler到Hopper的整个AI旅程中，我们大概实现了10万倍的提升。10年内10万倍。好的。在Hopper和Blackwell之间，由于NVLink，我们实现了72倍的提升，对吧？一年内30倍。然后Reuben会带来另一个X倍的提升，Fineman也会带来另一个X倍的提升。我们之所以能做到这一点，是因为晶体管帮不了我们太多，对吧？摩尔定律下的密度在增长，但性能没有增长。所以如果真是这样，我们必须解决的挑战之一是，我们必须在系统层面分解整个问题，同时改变每一个芯片、所有的软件栈和所有的系统。这是终极的“极端代码设计”。以前没有人以这种水平进行代码设计，对吧？我们改变CPU，革命性的CPU、GPU、网络芯片、NVLink的横向扩展、Spectrum X的横向扩展。有人说，我听到有人说：“哦，这只是以太网。”对。好吧，Spectrum X以太网不仅仅是以太网。人们开始发现，“我的天哪，这个X因子真是不可思议”，对吧？你知道，英伟达的以太网业务，单纯的以太网业务是世界上增长最快的以太网业务。是的。所以，横向扩展，当然，现在我们必须构建更大规模的系统。因此，我们将连接起来的多个AI工厂进行横向扩展。然后我们每年都这样做。所以我们现在在技术上实现了指数级的指数增长。这使得我们的客户能够降低Token的成本，通过预训练、后训练和思考让这些Token变得越来越智能。结果是，当AI变得更聪明时，它们被使用得更多。当它们被使用得更多时，它们就会呈指数级增长。

### 极端代码设计的意义与护城河的加深

For people who may not be as familiar. Yeah. What is extreme code design? Extreme code design means that you have to optimize the model, algorithm, system, and chip at the same time. You have to innovate outside the box, right? Because Moore's law said you just have to keep making the CPU faster and faster. Everything got faster. You were innovating within a box. Just make that chip faster. Yeah. Well, if that chip doesn't go any faster, then what are you going to do? Innovate outside the box. And so Nvidia really changed things because we did two things. We invented CUDA, invented GPUs, and we invented the idea of code design at a very large scale. That's why there's all these industries we're in. We're creating all these libraries and code design. Number one, full stack extreme is even beyond software and GPUs. It's now at the data center level switches and networking and you know all of that all of that software in the switches and the networking and the nicks the scale up the scale out optimizing across all of that as a result of that blackwell to hopper is 30x no moors law could possibly achieve that right and so that's extreme and that comes from the extreme code design that's because Nvidia has that's why we got into networking and switching and scale up and scale out and scale across and building CPUs and building GPUs and building nicks. You know that that's the reason why Nvidia is so rich in software and people we we check in more open-source software in the world than just about anybody except one other company. I think it's AI2 or something like that. And so so we have such enormous richness of software and that's just in AI. Don't forget computer graphics and digital biology and autonomous vehicles and you know the amount of software we produce as a company is incredible that allows us to do deep and extreme code designs.

对于那些不太熟悉的人来说，什么是极端代码设计？极端代码设计意味着你必须同时优化模型、算法、系统和芯片。你必须在盒子外面进行创新，对吧？因为摩尔定律说你只需要让CPU越来越快。一切都变快了。你是在一个框内创新，就是让那个芯片更快。如果那个芯片不再变快，你该怎么办？在盒子外面创新。所以英伟达真正改变了局面，因为我们做了两件事：我们发明了CUDA，发明了GPU，我们还发明了大规模代码设计的理念。这就是我们涉足所有这些行业的原因。我们正在创建所有这些库和代码设计。第一，全栈极端设计甚至超越了软件和GPU的范畴，它现在到了数据中心级别的交换机和网络，你知道所有这些，交换机和网络中的所有软件，以及NICS的横向扩展、纵向扩展，所有这些的优化，正是因此 Blackwell 比 Hopper 提升了 30 倍，这是摩尔定律不可能实现的，对吧？所以这就是极端设计，它来自于极端代码设计，因为英伟达拥有……这就是我们涉足网络、交换、横向扩展、纵向扩展、跨域扩展，构建CPU、构建GPU、构建NIC的原因。你知道，这就是为什么英伟达在软件和人才方面如此丰富。我们向开源软件的贡献量几乎超过了除另一家公司（我认为是AI2或其他什么）之外的任何一家公司。因此，我们在软件方面拥有极其丰富的资源，这还只是在AI领域。别忘了计算机图形学、数字生物学和自动驾驶汽车，你知道我们公司产生的软件量是惊人的，这使我们能够进行深入和极端的代码设计。

### 竞争壁垒：年度发布周期与供应链规模

I heard from one of your competitors you know yes he's doing this because it helps drive down the cost of token generation but at the same time your annual release cycle makes it almost impossible for your competitors to keep up. um the supply chain gets locked up more because you're giving three-year visibility to your supply chain. So now the supply chain has confidence as to what they can build to. So do you think about this? Wait wait wait before you before you ask the question. Think about this. In order for us to do several hundred billion dollars a year of AI infrastructure buildout. Yes. Think about how much capacity we had to go start a year ago. Yes. We're talking about building hundreds of billions of dollars of wafer starts and DRAM buys and are you you guys talking Yeah. This is now at a scale that hardly any company can keep up with. So would you say your competitive moat is greater today than it was three years ago? Yeah. You know, first of all, there's just more competition than ever before, but it's harder than ever before. Mhm. And the reason why I say that is because um wafer cost is getting wafer costs are getting higher which means that unless you do code design at an extreme scale you're just not going to be able to deliver the X factor growth number one number and so you you know unless you unless you're working on six seven eight chips a year right that's amazing thing it's not about building an ASIC it's about building an AI factory system and this system that has a lot of chips in and they're all co-designed and together they deliver that you know that 10x factor that we get uh almost regularly. Okay. So number one the code design is extreme. The second thing is that the scale is extreme. When your customers deploy a gigawatt that's a you know 400,000 500,000 GPUs right getting 500,000 GPUs to work together is a miracle. I mean it's just a miracle. And so they your customers are taking enormous risk on you to go buy all of this. You got to ask yourself what customer would place a $50 billion PO on an architecture, right? On an unproven architecture, a new one, right? A new architecture. Yeah. You just take out a whole new chip. You're as excited as you are about it, you know, and everybody's excited for you and and you just show the first silicon, right? Who's going to give you $50 billion PO, right? And why would you start $50 billion worth of wafers for a chip that just taped out? But for Nvidia, we could do that because our architecture is so proven. So number the the scale of our customer is so incredible. Now the scale of our supply chain is incredible, right? Who's going to start all of that stuff, pre-build all of that stuff for a company unless they know that Nvidia can deliver through? Isn't that right? and they believe that we can we can deliver through to all of the customers around the world. They're willing to start several hundred billion dollars at a time. This is just the scale is incredible.

我从一位竞争对手那里听说，是的，他之所以这样做是因为这有助于降低Token生成的成本，但同时，你们的年度发布周期使得竞争对手几乎无法跟上。供应链被锁定了，因为你为供应链提供了三年的可见性。现在供应链对他们能生产什么有信心了。你对此有何考虑？在你问问题之前，先想想这个。为了进行每年数千亿美元的AI基础设施建设，对吧？想一想我们一年前不得不开始准备多少产能。我们谈论的是数千亿美元的晶圆启动和DRAM采购，你们在谈论这个吗？是的。现在的规模几乎没有哪家公司能够跟上。那么，你认为你今天的竞争护城河比三年前更深了吗？是的。首先，竞争比以往任何时候都激烈，但难度也比以往任何时候都大。Mhm。我之所以这么说，是因为晶圆成本越来越高，这意味着除非你在极端规模上进行代码设计，否则你根本无法实现X倍的增长，这是第一点。所以，除非你每年都在开发六、七、八个芯片，对吧？这是惊人的，重点不在于构建一个ASIC，而在于构建一个AI工厂系统，这个系统包含大量芯片，它们都是协同设计的，共同实现了我们几乎定期获得的10倍提升。好的。所以第一，代码设计是极端的。第二点是规模是极端的。当你的客户部署一个吉瓦时，那就是40万到50万个GPU，对吧？让50万个GPU协同工作简直是个奇迹。我的意思是，这简直是个奇迹。所以你的客户为了购买所有这些东西，都在你身上承担着巨大的风险。你必须问自己，哪个客户会对一个架构下500亿美元的订单，对吧？对一个未经证明的新架构，对吧？一个新架构。是的。你推出一个全新的芯片，你对它感到兴奋，每个人都为你感到兴奋，然后你只展示了第一块芯片，对吧？谁会给你500亿美元的订单？你为什么要为一个刚刚完成设计的芯片启动价值500亿美元的晶圆呢？但对于英伟达来说，我们可以做到，因为我们的架构是如此成熟。所以，客户的规模是如此惊人。现在我们的供应链规模也是惊人的，对吧？谁会为一个公司预先启动、预先构建所有这些东西，除非他们知道英伟达能够交付？不是吗？他们相信我们能够向全球所有客户交付。他们愿意一次性启动数千亿美元的投资。这种规模是惊人的。

### GPU与ASIC之争：架构的优势与可编程性

To that point, you know, one of the biggest key debates and controversies in the world is this question of GPUs versus ASICs, Google's TPUs, Amazon's Tranium, and it seems like everyone from ARM to OpenAI to Enthropic are, you know, rumored to be building one. Mhm. Last year you said, you know, we're building systems, not chips, and you're driving performance through every single part of that stack. You also said that many of these projects may never get to production scale. But given like the the most of them, most of them, given the seeming success of Google's TPUs, you know, how are you thinking about this evolving landscape today? Yeah. And first of all, Mhm. the the advantage that that Google had is foresight. Remember, they started TPU1 before everything started. You know, this is no different than a startup. You're supposed to build a startup. You're supposed to create a startup before the market grows. Mhm. You're not supposed to come up as a startup when the market's a trillion dollars large. Mhm. You know the this fallacy and and all VCs know this this fallacy that a large market if you could just take a few percent market share you could be a giant company. That's actually fundamentally wrong. Yeah. You're supposed to take 100% of a tiny company, a tiny industry, which is what Nvidia did did, right? Which is what TPUs did. There were only the two of us. But you better hope that that industry gets really big. You're creating an industry. That's right. Right. and and I mean the Nvidia story you know which and so that's the challenge for the for people who are building ASICs now it looks like a juicy market but remember this juicy market has evolved from a chip called a GPU to I just described an AI factory and you guys just saw I just announced a chip called CPX for context processing and diffusion video generation a very specialized workload but an important workload inside a data center I just prelude it to maybe AI data processing processors because guess what? You need long-term memory. You need short-term memory. The KV cache processing is really intense. AI memory is a big deal. You know, you kind of like your AI to have good memory and just dealing with all the KV caching around the system. Really complicated stuff. Maybe it wants to have a specialized processor. Maybe there's other things, right? So you you see that Nvidia's our our our viewpoint is now not GPU. Our viewpoint is looking at the entire AI infrastructure and what does it take for these incredible companies to get all of their workload through it which is diverse and changing. Look at the transformer. The transformer architecture is changing incredibly. If not for the fact that CUDA is easy to operate on and iterate on, how do they try all of their vast number of experiments to decide which one of the transformer versions, what kind of attention algorithm to use? How do you disagregate? CUDA helps you do all that because it's so programmable. And so the way to think about our our our business now is you look at when when all of these ASIC companies or ASIC projects start 3, four, five years ago, I got to tell you that industry was super adorable and simple. There was a GPU involved, right? But now it's giant and complex and in another two years it's going to be completely massive. The scale is going to be so large. And so I think that the battle the the battle of getting into a very large market as a nent player is just hard you know as you guys know even for the customers who perhaps are successful with ASICs.

关于这一点，你知道，世界上最大、最具争议的辩论之一是GPU与ASIC的问题，谷歌的TPU、亚马逊的Tranium，似乎从ARM到OpenAI再到Anthropic都在传闻要制造自己的芯片。Mhm。去年你说过，我们构建的是系统，而不是芯片，你正在通过堆栈的每一个部分推动性能。你也说过，这些项目中的许多可能永远无法达到生产规模。但考虑到谷歌TPU似乎取得了成功，你今天如何看待这个不断发展的格局？首先，Mhm。谷歌的优势在于远见。还记得吗，他们在一切开始之前就开始了TPU1的研发。你知道，这和初创公司没什么不同。你应该在市场增长之前就建立一家初创公司，创造一家初创公司。你不应该在市场规模达到万亿美元时才以初创公司的身份出现。Mhm。你知道这个谬论，所有风险投资者都知道这个谬论，即在一个大市场中，如果你能占据几分之几的市场份额，你就能成为一家大公司。这实际上是根本错误的。是的。你应该占据一个微小公司、一个微小行业的100%份额，这正是英伟达所做的，对吧？TPU所做的也是如此。我们是仅有的两家之一。但你最好希望那个行业变得非常庞大。你正在创造一个行业。没错。没错。我的意思是英伟达的故事……所以，对于那些现在正在构建ASIC的人来说，这是一个挑战，看起来是一个诱人的市场，但请记住，这个诱人的市场已经从一种叫做GPU的芯片发展到我刚才描述的AI工厂，你们也看到了，我刚宣布了一款名为CPX的芯片，用于上下文处理和扩散视频生成，这是一个非常专业化但重要的数据中心内部工作负载。我只是把它引申为可能是AI数据处理处理器，因为你猜怎么着？你需要长期记忆，需要短期记忆。KV缓存处理非常紧张。AI内存是个大问题。你知道，你希望你的AI有良好的记忆力，并处理系统周围所有的KV缓存。非常复杂的东西。也许它需要一个专门的处理器。也许还有其他事情，对吧？所以你看，英伟达的观点不再是GPU。我们的观点是关注整个AI基础设施，以及如何才能让这些令人难以置信的公司完成他们所有多样化且不断变化的工作负载。看看Transformer，Transformer架构正在发生巨大变化。如果不是因为CUDA易于操作和迭代，他们如何尝试他们庞大的实验数量来决定使用哪个Transformer版本，使用哪种注意力算法？你如何分解？CUDA可以帮助你做到这一切，因为它具有很强的可编程性。所以我们现在看待我们业务的方式是，你看看当所有这些ASIC公司或ASIC项目在三、四、五年前开始时，我得告诉你，那个行业非常可爱且简单。有一个GPU参与其中，对吧？但现在它变得巨大而复杂，在接下来的两年里，它将变得完全庞大。规模会非常大。所以我认为，作为一个新进入者进入一个非常大的市场是困难的，你知道，即使对于那些可能在ASIC方面取得成功的客户来说也是如此。

### 硬件的解耦与生态系统的开放性

Isn't there an optimal balance in their compute fleet like it's you know I think investors are very much binary creatures. They just want a yes or no black and white answer. But even even if you get the ASIC to work, isn't there an optimal balance because you think I'm buying the Nvidia platform, CPX is going to come out for prefill for, you know, for video generation, maybe a decode, you know, you know, a platform video. Exactly. Yeah. So there will be like many different um chips or parts to add to the Nvidia ecosystem, accelerated compute fleet, right? as new workloads are, you know, are are born. That's right. And, you know, people trying to tape out new chips today are not really anticipating what's happening a year from now. They're just trying to get a chip to work. That's right. Set another way, Google's a big GPU customer. Google's a big GPU customer. Um, if you look at and Google is a very special case. I mean, we just have to, you know, show respect where respect is really deserved. I mean, uh, TPU is on TPU7. Yes. Right. And so um and and uh and it's a challenge for them as well, right? And so so the work that they do is incredibly hard. So so I think the first thing to to let let me do a um you know remember there there are three categories of chips. There's the category chips that are architectural. X86 CPUs, ARM CPUs, Nvidia GPUs. Architectural And it has an ecosystem above and and um uh the architecture uh allows uh has rich IP and rich ecosystem very complicated technology. It's built by the owners like us. Okay. There's ASICs. I worked for the original company LSI Logic who invented the idea of ASICs. As you know LSI Logic is not here anymore, right? And the reason for that is because ASICs is really fantastic. When the the market size is not very large, um it's easy to have somebody uh be a contractor to help you put the packaging of all that stuff together and do the manufacturing on your behalf and they charge you 50 60 points of margin. But when the market gets large for an ASIC, there's a new way of doing things called coot, customer-owned tooling. And who would who would do something like that? Um Apple's as Apple Apple's smartphone chip the volume is so large they would never go pay somebody else 50 60% gross margin to be an ASIC. They do customer own tooling. And so um where will TPUs go when they when it becomes a large business? Customer own tooling. There's no question about it. And so a but there's a place for ASICs. Uh video transcoders will never be too large. Um, smart nicks will never be too large. And so when when there's 10, 12, 15 as projects going on at an ASIC company, I'm not surprised by that, you know, because there there probably five smart nicks and four transcoders and, you know, are they all AI chips? Of course not. You know, and and if somebody were to build an embedded embedding processor for a specific recommender system and that was an ASIC, of course you could do that. But would you do that as the fundamental compute engine for AI that's changing all the time? You've got low latency workload. You got high throughput lo workload. You have token generation for chat. You have thinking workload. You have AI video generation workload. Is there a you know now you're talking about the workhorse backbone of your accelerated? That's what Nvidia is all about. Again, dumb this down. It's like playing chess and checkers, right? The fact of the matter is the folks who are starting ASICs today whether it's Tranium or whether it's some of these other accelerators etc. they're building a chip that's a component of a much larger machine. you've built a very sophisticated system, platform, factory, whatever you want to call it, and now you're opening up a little bit, right? So, you mentioned CPXGPU, right? That is, it seems to me that it in some ways you're disagregating the workloads to the best slice of the hardware for that particular domain.

在这一点上，你知道，关于GPU与ASIC的争论是最大的争议之一，谷歌的TPU、亚马逊的Tranium，似乎从ARM到OpenAI再到Anthropic都在传闻要制造自己的芯片。Mhm。去年你说过，我们构建的是系统，而不是芯片，你正在通过堆栈的每一个部分推动性能。你也说过，这些项目中的许多可能永远无法达到生产规模。但考虑到谷歌TPU似乎取得了成功，你今天如何看待这个不断发展的格局？是的。首先，Mhm。谷歌的优势在于远见。还记得吗，他们在一切开始之前就开始了TPU1的研发。你知道，这和初创公司没什么不同。你应该在市场增长之前就建立一家初创公司。你不应该在市场规模达到万亿美元时才以初创公司的身份出现。Mhm。你知道这个谬论，所有风险投资者都知道这个谬论，即在一个大市场中，如果你能占据几分之几的市场份额，你就能成为一家大公司。这实际上是根本错误的。是的。你应该占据一个微小公司、一个微小行业的100%份额，这正是英伟达所做的，对吧？TPU所做的也是如此。我们是仅有的两家之一。但你最好希望那个行业变得非常庞大。你正在创造一个行业。没错。没错。我的意思是英伟达的故事……所以，对于那些现在正在构建ASIC的人来说，这看起来是一个诱人的市场，但请记住，这个诱人的市场已经从一种叫做GPU的芯片发展到我刚才描述的AI工厂，你们也看到了，我刚宣布了一款名为CPX的芯片，用于上下文处理和扩散视频生成，这是一个非常专业化但重要的数据中心内部工作负载。我只是把它引申为可能是AI数据处理处理器，因为你猜怎么着？你需要长期记忆，需要短期记忆。KV缓存处理非常紧张。AI内存是个大问题。你知道，你希望你的AI有良好的记忆力，并处理系统周围所有的KV缓存。非常复杂的东西。也许它需要一个专门的处理器。也许还有其他事情，对吧？所以你看，英伟达的观点不再是GPU。我们的观点是关注整个AI基础设施，以及如何才能让这些令人难以置信的公司完成他们所有多样化且不断变化的工作负载。看看Transformer，Transformer架构正在发生巨大变化。如果不是因为CUDA易于操作和迭代，他们如何尝试他们庞大的实验数量来决定使用哪个Transformer版本，使用哪种注意力算法？你如何分解？CUDA可以帮助你做到这一切，因为它具有很强的可编程性。所以我们现在看待我们业务的方式是，你看看当所有这些ASIC公司或ASIC项目在三、四、五年前开始时，我得告诉你，那个行业非常可爱且简单。有一个GPU参与其中，对吧？但现在它变得巨大而复杂，在接下来的两年里，它将变得完全庞大。规模会非常大。所以我认为，作为一个新进入者进入一个非常大的市场是困难的，你知道，即使对于那些可能在ASIC方面取得成功的客户来说也是如此。

### 开放生态系统与芯片差异化的价值

Well, we did we announced this thing called Dynamo, right? disagregated orch AI workload orchestration and we open sourced it because the future AI factory is disagregated right and you launched MV Fusion that even said to your competitors including Intel which you just invested in that's right you know the way in which you participate in this factory that we're building because nobody else is crazy enough to try to build the entire factory but you can plug into that if you have a product that's good enough, compelling enough that the end user says, "Hey, we want to use this instead of an ARM GPU or we want to use this instead of your inference accelerator, etc. Is that correct?" We're delighted delighted to connect you in. Yeah. Tell us a little bit fusion such a great idea and we're so happy to partner with Intel on that. It takes takes the Intel ecosystem, you know, there most of the world's enterprise still runs on Intel. It takes the Intel ecosystem, takes the Nvidia AI ecosystem, accelerated computing, and we fused it together, right? And we did that with ARM, right? And there are several others we're going to be doing it with. And and uh that that opens up opportunities for both of us. It's a win for both of us. Great great win. I'll be a large customer of theirs and uh they're going to expose us to a a much much larger market opportunity.

我们宣布了Dynamo，对吧？解耦的AI工作负载编排，我们将其开源了，因为未来的AI工厂是解耦的，对吧？你推出了MV Fusion，甚至告诉了你的竞争对手，包括你刚刚投资的英特尔，对吧？参与我们正在构建的这个工厂的方式，因为没有别人疯狂到要尝试构建整个工厂，但如果你有一个足够好的、足够有吸引力的产品，让最终用户说：“嘿，我们想使用这个而不是ARM GPU，或者我们想使用这个而不是你的推理加速器等等”，你就可以接入进来。是这样吗？我们非常高兴地欢迎你们加入。是的。Fusion真是个好主意，我们很高兴能与英特尔合作。它利用了英特尔的生态系统，你知道，世界上大多数企业仍然运行在英特尔平台上。它结合了英特尔生态系统、英伟达AI生态系统、加速计算，并将它们融合在一起，对吧？我们与ARM也这样做了，对吧？我们还将与其他几家公司这样做。这为我们双方都开辟了机会。这是双赢。一个巨大的胜利。我将成为他们的一个大客户，他们将为我们带来一个大得多的市场机会。

### 成本优势：性能/功耗比的决定性作用

Yeah. that's deeply related to this idea is the argument you've made that kind of um c shock some people where you say our competitors building ASICs they could literally all their chips are cheaper already today but they could literally price them at zero our objective is they could price them at zero and you would still buy an Nvidia system because the total cost of operating that system power data center land etc the intelligence out is still a better bet than buying a chip even if it's given to you for free because the land power and shell is already $15 billion, right? So, we've taken a crack at kind of the math on that. But walk us through your math because I think for people who don't spend as much time here that it just doesn't compute. How could it possibly be that you were pricing your competitor's chips at zero given the expense of your chips and it still is a better bet? There's two ways to think about it. Um, one way is um, uh, let's just think about it from a perspective of revenues. Yes. Okay. So everybody's power limited and let's say uh you were able to secure two more gigawatts of power. Well, that two gigawatts of power you would like to have translate to revenues. Yes. So your performance or tokens per watt was twice as high as somebody else's token per watt because you did I did deep and extreme code design, right? And my performance was much higher per unit energy, then my customer can produce twice as much revenues from their data center. And who doesn't want twice as much revenues? and and and if somebody gave them a 15% discount, you know, the difference between our gross margins, which is called the 75 points, and somebody else's gross margins, call it the 50 to 65 points, is not so much as to make up for the 30 times difference between Black Wall and Hopper. Let's pretend Hopper Hopper is an amazing chip, an amazing system. Let's pretend somebody else's ASIC is Hopper. Yeah. Black Wall's 30 times. So you've got to give up 30x revenues in that one gigawatt. It's too much to give up. So even if they gave it to you for free, you you you only have 2 gigawatts to work with. Your opportunity cost is so insanely high. You would always choose the best perf per watt.

关于这一点，你提出的论点让一些人感到震惊，你说我们的竞争对手制造的ASIC，他们所有的芯片今天已经更便宜了，但他们可以把价格定为零，我们的目标是，即使他们把价格定为零，你仍然会购买英伟达的系统，因为运行该系统的总成本——电力、数据中心、土地等，以及从中获得的智能——仍然是更好的选择，即使芯片是免费提供的，因为土地和电力成本已经高达150亿美元，对吧？我们对这个数学进行了一番推算。但请向我们解释一下你的数学逻辑，因为对于那些不常接触这些的人来说，这简直不合逻辑。鉴于你们芯片的高昂价格，怎么可能以零定价竞争对手的芯片仍然是更好的选择呢？有两种思考方式。一种方式是，让我们从收入的角度来思考。好的。所以每个人的资源都受限于电力，假设你能获得另外两个吉瓦的电力。你想获得的这两个吉瓦电力会转化为收入。是的。所以你的每瓦性能或每瓦Token量是别人每瓦Token量的两倍，因为我们进行了深入而极端的代码设计，对吧？而我的每单位能源的性能要高得多，那么我的客户就能从他们的数据中心产生两倍的收入。谁不想要两倍的收入呢？而且，即使有人给了他们15%的折扣，我们毛利率（称为75点）与别人毛利率（称为50到65点）之间的差异，也不足以弥补Blackwell与Hopper之间30倍的差距。我们假设Hopper是一个了不起的芯片、了不起的系统。假设别人的ASIC就是Hopper。是的。Blackwell是30倍。所以你必须放弃那一个吉瓦中30倍的收入。放弃的代价太大了。所以即使他们免费给你，你只有2吉瓦可供使用。你的机会成本高得离谱。你总是会选择最好的每瓦性能。

### 持续的性能提升与生态系统锁定

So I heard this from one of the CFOs at one of the hyperscalers that given the performance improvement right that's coming out of your chips again precisely to that point tokens per per gig um and power being the limiting factor right that they had to upgrade uh to the new cycle so when you look ahead at Ruben at Ruben Ultra at Fineman does that trajectory continue we're building what six seven chips a year now yeah and and each one that's part of that system. That's right. And those that system software is everywhere and it takes it takes the integration and the optimization across all of those six seven chips to deliver on the 30x blackwell. Now imagine I'm doing this every single year. Bam bam bam bam bam bam. And so if you build one ASIC in that soup of ASICs in that soup of chips and we're optimizing across that, you know, it's a hard problem to solve.

我从一位超大规模客户的首席财务官那里听说，鉴于你们芯片带来的性能提升——正是基于每吉瓦Token数和电力是限制因素——他们不得不升级到新的周期。所以当你展望Reuben、Reuben Ultra、Fineman时，这个轨迹会继续吗？我们现在每年正在构建六七个芯片，对吧？是的，每个芯片都是那个系统的一部分。没错。而且那个系统的软件无处不在，需要整合和优化所有这六七个芯片才能实现Blackwell的30倍提升。现在想象一下，我每年都在这样做，砰砰砰砰砰砰。所以如果你在那一堆ASIC、那一堆芯片中构建了一个ASIC，而我们正在跨越它们进行优化，你知道，这是一个很难解决的问题。

### 竞争护城河的加深与巨大的增长潜力

This does bring me back to where we started about the competitive moat. We've been covering this and investors for a while. We're investors throughout the ecosystem and in competitors of yours, you know, from Google to to Broadcom. But when I really just first principles around this and say are you increasing or decreasing your competitive moat. You move to an annual cadence. You're co-developing with a with a supply chain. The scale is massively bigger than anybody anticipated which requires scale both of balance sheet and of development. Right? the moves you made both through acquisition and organically with things like Envy Fusion, CPX, which we just talked about. All of those things together cause me to believe that your competitive moat is increasing visav at least in so far as building out the factory or the system. It's at least surprising. But but I think it's interesting that your multiple is much lower than most of those other people. And I think part of that has to do with this law of large numbers. A $4.5 trillion company couldn't possibly get any bigger. But I asked you this a year and a half ago as you sit here today. If the market's going to AI workloads are going to 10x or 5x, you know, we know what capex is doing, etc. Is there any conceivable world in your mind where your top line in 5 years isn't two or 3x bigger than it is in 2025? Like what's the probability that it's actually not not much higher than it is today given those advantages?

这又把我带回了我们开始讨论的竞争护城河。我们一直在关注这一点，投资者也关注了一段时间。我们是整个生态系统中的投资者，也是你们竞争对手的投资者，你知道，从谷歌到博通。但当我真正从第一性原理来审视这个问题，并问你是否在增加或削弱你的竞争护城河时：你转向了年度节奏。你与供应链进行协同开发。规模比任何人预期的都要大得多，这需要资产负债表和开发规模上的双重规模。对吧？你通过收购和有机增长所采取的举措，比如我们刚才谈到的Envy Fusion、CPX，所有这些加起来让我相信，你的竞争护城河正在增加，至少在构建工厂或系统方面是这样。这至少是令人惊讶的。但我想有趣的是，你们的估值倍数比其他大多数公司要低得多。我想这部分原因与大数定律有关。一家4.5万亿美元的公司不可能变得更大。但我在一年前半问过你这个问题，你今天坐在这里。如果市场将转向AI工作负载，增长10倍或5倍，你知道资本支出正在做什么，等等。在你看来，有没有任何可能的世界，你的收入在5年后不会比2025年大两到三倍？考虑到这些优势，它比今天高出很多的概率是多少？

I'll answer it this way. Our opportunity as I described it is much larger than the consensus. I'll say it here. I think Nvidia will likely be the first 10 trillion dollar company. And I would I've been here long enough, it wasn't that long ago, just a decade ago, as you well remember, that people said there could never be a trillion dollar company. Now we have 10, right? And today the world's bigger, right? And today, this is this is the back to the exponentials around GDP and the growth.

我会这样回答：正如我所描述的，我们的机会比共识要大得多。我在这里说，我认为英伟达很可能会成为第一家万亿美元的公司。我在这里待了很久，十年前，正如你还记得的，人们说不可能有万亿美元的公司。现在我们有了10家，对吧？而今天，世界更大了，对吧？今天，这又回到了关于GDP和增长的指数级增长。

### 英伟达的定位：AI基础设施提供商

The world is bigger and and and people misunderstand what we do. They they uh they remember we're a chip company, right? And we are we build chips. Boy, do we build chips and build the most amazing chips in the world. But NVIDIA is really an AI infrastructure company. You know, we are your AI infrastructure partner and our partnership with OpenAI is a perfect demonstration of that. Yeah. That we are their AI infrastructure partner and we work with people in a lot of different ways. You know, you you you would uh we we don't require anybody to buy everything from us. Um we don't we don't require that they buy uh the full rack. They could buy a chip. They could buy a component. They could buy our networking. They could buy our We have customers buying only our CPU. You know, just buy our GPUs and buy somebody else's CPUs and somebody else's networking. You know, we're kind of okay selling any way you like to buy. You know, my only request is just buy a little something from us. You know, you said, you know, this isn't just about better models. We also have to build. We have to we have to have world-class builders. And you said, you know, the most world-class builder maybe that we have in the country is Elon Musk. And we talked about Colossus one and what he, you know, what he was doing there, standing up a couple hundred thousand, you know, at the time H100s, H200s in a coherent cluster. Now he's working on Colossus 2, you know, which may be 500,000 GBs, um, millions of H100 equivalents in a coherent cluster. I would not be surprised if he gets to a gigawatt before anybody else does in one.

世界变大了，人们误解了我们所做的事情。他们还记得我们是一家芯片公司，对吧？我们确实制造芯片，而且我们制造世界上最了不起的芯片。但英伟达本质上是一家AI基础设施公司。我们是你们的AI基础设施合作伙伴，我们与OpenAI的合作就是完美的证明。是的。我们是他们的AI基础设施合作伙伴，我们以多种方式与人们合作。你知道，我们不要求任何人必须向我们购买所有东西。我们不要求他们购买整机柜。他们可以买芯片，可以买组件，可以买我们的网络设备，可以买我们的……我们有客户只购买我们的CPU。你知道，他们只购买我们的GPU，然后购买别人的CPU和别人的网络设备。你知道，我们对于任何购买方式都持开放态度。我唯一的要求就是从我们这里买点东西。你说过，这不仅仅关乎更好的模型。我们也必须建设，我们必须拥有世界一流的建设者。你说过，我们国家也许最世界一流的建设者是埃隆·马斯克。我们谈论了Colossus 1，以及他当时在那里做什么，在相干集群中部署了几十万个H100、H200。现在他正在研究Colossus 2，可能包含50万个GB，数百万个H100等效物在相干集群中。我不会惊讶他是否会第一个达到一个吉瓦的规模。

### 埃隆·马斯克作为系统建设者的优势

So say a little bit about that. The advantage of being, you know, the builder who, you know, isn't just building the software and the models, but understands what it takes to to build those clusters. Well, you know, these AI supercomputers are complicated things. The technology is complicated. Procuring it is complicated because of financing issues. Securing the land power and shell, powering it is complicated. Building it all, bringing it all up. I mean, these are this is unfortunately the most complex systems problem humanity has ever endeavored. And and so Elon has has a great advantage that in his head um all of these systems are interoperating and um and the and the interdependencies um are are um you know resides in one head including the financing. Yes. He's a big GPT. He's a big supercomputer himself. He's the Yeah. the ultimate GPU. Yeah. Yeah. And so so he has a great advantage there. Yeah. And and he has a great sense of urgency. He Yeah. He has a has a real desire to to build it and and so when when will comes together with with skill. Yeah. unbelievable things can happen. Yes. Quite unique.

请多谈谈这个。作为一名建设者，你不仅构建软件和模型，还了解构建这些集群需要什么，这是一种优势。你知道，这些AI超级计算机是复杂的东西。技术很复杂。由于融资问题，采购也很复杂。确保土地、电力和外壳，为其供电也很复杂。将这一切构建起来，启动它们。我的意思是，不幸的是，这是人类有史以来遇到的最复杂的系统问题。所以埃隆有一个巨大的优势，在他的脑海中，所有这些系统都在互操作，而且……依赖关系都存在于一个人的脑海中，包括融资。是的。他自己就是一个大的GPT，一个大的超级计算机。他是……是的，终极GPU。是的。所以他在那里有一个巨大的优势。是的。而且他有很强的紧迫感。是的。他有一种真正的愿望去构建它。所以当愿望与技能结合在一起时，不可思议的事情就会发生。是的。非常独特。

### 主权AI与全球AI竞赛

Something you've been so involved in is I want to talk about sovereign AI. I want to talk about China and the global AI race that's going on. You know, when I look back at you 30 years ago, you couldn't have imagined you were going to be hanging out in palaces with airs and the king this week and you're at the White House all the time. The president has said that you and Nvidia are critical to uh US, you know, national security. So when when you look at that first just contextualize for me like it's hard to believe that you would be in those places if sovereigns didn't view this at least as existential as important as maybe we did nuclear in the 1940s right we don't have a Manhattan project today at least funded by the government but it's funded by Nvidia it's funded by open AI it's funded by Meta it's funded by Google we have companies today the size of nation states and thank god God for America, right? Who are funding something that it appears to me presidents and kings think are think is existential to their future economic and national security. Would you agree with that?

你非常投入的另一件事是，我想谈谈主权AI。我想谈谈中国以及正在进行中的全球AI竞赛。你知道，回望30年前，你无法想象本周你会与王室成员在宫殿里消磨时光，而且你一直都在白宫。总统说你和英伟达对美国的国家安全至关重要。所以当你审视这一点时，首先请为我明确一下：如果主权国家不认为AI至少和我们在1940年代认为核能一样重要，我很难相信你会出现在那些地方。今天我们没有政府资助的“曼哈顿计划”，但它由英伟达、OpenAI、Meta、谷歌资助。今天我们有像国家一样大的公司，感谢上帝和美国，对吧？他们资助着一些在我看来，总统和国王认为对其未来经济和国家安全至关重要的事物。你同意吗？

Nobody needs atomic bombs. Everybody needs AI. Well said. Okay. Here. Here. Yeah. Here. And and so that's a very very large difference. Um AI AI as you know is modern software. I just that's where I started from general purpose computing to accelerated computing from human written code line at a time to AI written code that foundation can't be forgotten we've reinvented computing there's not a new species on earth we just reinvented computing and everybody needs computing it needs to be democratized which is the reason why everybody all of these all of the countries realize they have to get into the AI world because everybody needs to stay in computing. There's nobody in the world that says, "Guess what? You know, I used computers yesterday. I'm pretty good with, you know, clubs and fire tomorrow, you know, and so everybody needs to move into computing. It's just it's just being modernized. That's all." Okay. Number one, um it it is the case that that in order to participate in AI, you have to encode within AI, your your history, your culture, your values. And and of course AI is getting smarter and smarter so that even the core AI is able to learn these things fairly quickly. You don't have to start from the ground, you know, from ground zero. And so I I think that that every country um needs to have some sovereign capability. I recommend that they all use OpenAI, they all use Gemini, they all use, you know, these open models use Grok and I think they I recommend they all use Anthropic. Um but they should also dedicate resources to learn how to build AI. And the reason for that is because they need to learn how to build it not just for language models, but they need to build it for industrial models, manufacturing models, national security, national security models. There's a whole bunch of intelligence they had to go cultivate themselves. So they they ought to have sovereign capability. Every country should develop it.

没有人需要原子弹。每个人都需要AI。说得好。好的。是的。所以这是一个非常非常大的区别。AI，如你所知，是现代软件。我就是从通用计算转向加速计算，从人工逐行编写代码转向AI编写代码，这个基础不能被忘记。我们重新发明了计算，地球上没有新的物种，我们只是重新发明了计算，每个人都需要计算，它需要民主化。这就是为什么每个国家都意识到他们必须进入AI世界，因为每个人都需要留在计算领域。世界上没有人会说：“你猜怎么着？我昨天还用电脑，明天我就用棍子和火，对吧？”所以每个人都需要进入计算领域。它只是正在现代化。就这样。第一点，确实如此，为了参与AI，你必须在AI中编码你的历史、文化和价值观。当然，AI越来越聪明，以至于即使是核心AI也能相当快地学习这些东西。你不需要从零开始。所以，我认为每个国家都需要具备一定的自主能力。我建议他们都使用OpenAI、Gemini，使用这些开放模型，使用Grok，我也推荐他们都使用Anthropic。但他们也应该投入资源来学习如何构建AI。这样做的原因是因为他们不仅需要学习如何为语言模型构建，还需要为工业模型、制造模型、国家安全、国家安全模型构建。他们需要培养自己的一整套智能。所以他们应该拥有主权能力。每个国家都应该发展它。

### 主权能力与基础设施建设

And is that what you see? Is that what you're hearing around the world? They all realize it. They all realize they all realize it. And they they all are going to be customers of OpenAI and Throbic and Grock and Gemini, but they all really need to also build their own infrastructure. And this is this is the big idea that that what Nvidia does is we're building infrastructure. Just as every country needs energy infrastructure, the communications and internet infrastructure, now every single country needs AI infrastructure. So you let's start with the rest of the world. You know, our our good friend David Saxs. Um the AIS are doing a heck of a job. We are in so lucky. Yeah. To have David and Shriram in Washington DC. Um doing you know and David doing Yeah. doing AI in the AISR. Uh this at what a what a smart move by President Trump to put them in the White House. Um because during this pivotal time the technology is complicated. Shriram is the only person in Washington DC that I think knows CUDA. Yeah. Um and and which is strange anyways. But but I I just love the fact that during this pivotal time when technology is complicated, policy is complicated, the impact to the future of our nation is so great that we have somebody who is clear-minded, dedicating the time to understand the technology and thoughtful to uh help us through that.

你看到了吗？这是你在世界各地听到的吗？他们都意识到了。他们都意识到，他们都意识到他们都将是OpenAI、Anthropic、Grok和Gemini的客户，但他们也都真的需要建立自己的基础设施。这就是英伟达所做的大事：我们正在建设基础设施。正如每个国家都需要能源基础设施、通信和互联网基础设施一样，现在每个国家都需要AI基础设施。让我们从世界其他地方开始。你知道，我们的老朋友大卫·萨克斯。AI团队在华盛顿特区做得非常出色。我们太幸运了。能在大卫和Shriram在华盛顿特区。大卫正在做……是的，正在做AI的AI战略评估。特朗普总统让他们进入白宫真是个明智之举。因为在这个关键时刻，技术很复杂。Shriram是我认为华盛顿特区唯一懂CUDA的人。是的。这本来就很奇怪。但我喜欢这样一个事实：在这个技术复杂、政策复杂、对我们国家未来影响巨大的关键时刻，我们有人头脑清晰，致力于理解技术，并深思熟虑地帮助我们度过难关。

### 政府支持与能源战略

And it would seem to me, yeah, I'm going back to the Manhattan Project analogy. Yeah. Right. that you have a president who understands how existential this is. You have governors like Greg Abbott in Texas who want to remove regulations to accelerate because they understand how important it is. You have secretaries right at energy and Doug Bergram at interior and Lutnik at commerce who also understand how important this is, how pro-energy they are. Could you imagine? Could you imagine the alternative if we had an administration right now who is not pro-energy and want energy to grow in our nation so that we could have AI? I find it I just can't even think about it. I find it ironic that that that just a couple years ago we were saying China's building a 100 nuclear reactors. They're so far ahead of us. Like that's the the the primitive to AI. But now you have people when we go to build it, everybody says, "Oh, it's a glut, right?" Like it seems to me that this is something that the government, it is in their interest. And we have industry and government working together in a way that I haven't seen in a long time. You've been around a long time. You you're very close with President Trump at this stage. Help us understand like what is the nature of industry government relationships? We saw that dinner last week with all the CEOs. You know, you spent a lot of time. Is it unique? Have you seen anything like this in your career over the last 30 years?

在我看来，是的，我回到了曼哈顿计划的比喻。对吧？你有一位总统，他明白这有多么生死攸关。你有德克萨斯州州长格雷格·阿博特这样的人，他们希望取消监管以加速发展，因为他们明白这有多重要。你还有能源部长、内政部的Doug Bergram和商务部的Lutnik，他们也明白这有多重要，他们有多么支持能源发展。你能想象吗？如果你现在有一个不亲能源、不希望能源在我们国家发展的政府，那么我们怎么可能有AI呢？我简直无法想象。我觉得很有讽刺意味的是，就在几年前，我们还在说中国正在建造100座核反应堆，他们比我们领先太多了。这像是AI的原始阶段。但现在，当我们去建设时，每个人都说：“哦，是供应过剩，对吧？”在我看来，政府的利益所在就是支持这项建设。现在产业和政府的合作方式，是我很长时间以来没有见过的。你在这个行业很久了，你与特朗普总统关系密切。请告诉我们，产业与政府关系是怎样的？我们看到了上周所有CEO们一起吃的那顿晚餐。你花了很多时间。这很独特吗？在你过去30年的职业生涯中见过这样的情况吗？

It was it was hard to go to DC in the past as you know. Uh getting an appointment is almost impossible, right? Uh President Trump has a open door to leaders who wants to come in and uh help them understand the future. Um this is an administration that believes in growth. Fundamentally, President Trump wants America to grow. Yeah. If we can grow economically, we will be strong militarily. If we could be if we could grow economically, we will be secure. I've never met somebody who is secure who's poor. Being being rich as a nation is an essential part of national security. And he knows that. He also wants America to win the AI the the AI race. This is going to be a very long-term race. And um and he understands that this is a pivotal time. He wants the technology industry to run. He wants everybody in the world to be built on American technology. These are sensible, logical things. You know, the opposite is strange to me. If I take everything and I just reversed it, we want our country not to grow and because we don't want our country to grow, we don't need any energy because we know we need energy to grow and so let's not have any energy and in fact we don't want our technology industry to lead. Uh he understands that our technology industry is our national treasure. Correct. And that technology like corn and steel and things in the past are now such fundamental trade opportunities. It's an essential part of trade. And why would you not want American technology to be coveted by everyone so that it could be used for trade?

你知道，过去去华盛顿特区是很困难的。预约几乎是不可能的，对吧？特朗普总统对那些想来了解未来、帮助他理解未来的领导者持开放态度。这是一个相信增长的政府。从根本上说，特朗普总统希望美国增长。如果我们经济增长，我们就会在军事上强大。如果我们经济增长，我们就会安全。我从未见过一个安全却贫穷的人。一个国家富裕是国家安全的重要组成部分。他知道这一点。他也希望美国赢得AI竞赛。这将是一场非常长期的竞赛。他理解这是一个关键时刻。他希望科技产业能够发展。他希望全世界都建立在 अमेरिकी 技术之上。这些都是合理、合乎逻辑的事情。对我来说，相反的情况是奇怪的。如果我把所有事情都反过来，我们不希望我们的国家增长，因为我们不希望国家增长，我们就不需要能源，因为我们知道我们需要能源才能增长，所以我们干脆不要任何能源，事实上我们不希望我们的科技产业领先。他明白我们的科技产业是我们的国家宝藏。正确。这项技术就像过去的玉米和钢铁一样，是如此基本的贸易机会。它是贸易的基本组成部分。你为什么不希望美国技术受到所有人的追捧，以便用于贸易呢？

### 推广美国技术与“小院高墙”的矛盾

Right. So let's talk about you know the internet. Yeah. Google spread around the world. Yeah, we had democratic values spread around the world by way of search and Google didn't have to go to Washington to get permission to do it. It just happened. We diffused our technology around the world. David Sachs has been crystal clear of the need to accelerate export licenses so that the American AI stack wins around the world. Right? We're talking chips, we're talking models, we're talking data centers, etc. We know a year and a half ago that wasn't happening. was a concept that was called small yard tall fence or something like that. A small yard tall fence around America. That was the strange part. I think President Trump's got it right that we want to maximize exports. We want to maximize American influence around the world. We're supposed to maximize those things. And do you see those licenses coming? Are you seeing the acceleration in Washington? I know it's being said at the top, but are you seeing it flow down through government that's accelerating us around the world? Secretary Lutnick was all over it.

所以我们来谈谈互联网。是的。谷歌遍布全球。是的，我们通过搜索让民主价值观传播到全世界，谷歌不必去华盛顿申请许可。它就发生了。我们将我们的技术传播到世界各地。大卫·萨克斯一直非常明确地指出，需要加快出口许可证的发放，以确保美国的AI技术在全世界获胜。对吧？我们谈论芯片、模型、数据中心等等。我们知道一年半前，这种情况没有发生。有一个概念叫做“小院高墙”或者类似的东西。一道小院高墙围绕着美国。那是奇怪的部分。我认为特朗普总统抓住了重点，我们希望最大限度地出口。我们希望最大限度地扩大美国在世界上的影响力。我们应该最大限度地发挥这些作用。你看到这些许可证了吗？你看到华盛顿正在加速吗？我知道高层已经说了，但你是否看到它通过政府层面渗透下来，加速我们在全球的部署？卢特尼克部长对此非常关注。

### 中国市场的竞争与美国战略

So, now let's talk about China. You know what most people may not realize is I think you understand China as well as any leader in the United States. We've been there for 30 years. Been there for 30 years. What most people don't realize is is up until a couple years ago, you had dominant market share within China in terms of 95% market share. And you have said that our biggest goal that we as a country could have under the guise of somehow trying to slow them down is we've unilaterally disarmed. We forced Nvidia out of China, which has allowed Huawei to accelerate on the back of monopoly profits within China. And I just saw this morning, you're seeing announcements out of Huawei and Baba and others that they're going to build data centers around the world. Now Huawei has a three-year plan to pass Nvidia funded by the monopoly profits in the biggest AI market in the world. So it's looking like your admonition that this is a huge mistake to hand China, you know, monopoly markets is coming true. The president said, you know, a a after kind of the ban on H20s, now we have a situation where you can sell, you know, chips to China, but there's a 15% export tax. But now it appears that the Chinese perhaps offended by statements out of the United States are saying no, Nvidia is not allowed to sell here. Now where do we stand today between Nvidia and China? And can you reiterate kind of what you think we as a country should be doing to put ourselves in a best position to win the AI race around the world?

现在我们来谈谈中国。大多数人可能没有意识到的是，我认为你对中国的了解不亚于美国任何一位领导人。我们已经在那里待了30年。30年了。大多数人没有意识到的是，直到几年前，你在中国的市场份额占据主导地位，高达95%的市场份额。你说过，我们国家在试图减缓他们的同时，可以做的最大的事情就是我们单方面解除武装了。我们把英伟达赶出了中国，这使得华为得以在中国利用垄断利润加速发展。我今天早上刚看到，华为、阿里巴巴等公司正在宣布他们将在世界各地建立数据中心。现在华为有一个三年计划，旨在超越英伟达，其资金来源于全球最大的AI市场中的垄断利润。所以，你之前告诫我们把垄断市场拱手让给中国是一个巨大的错误，这正在成为现实。总统说，在禁止H20之后，现在的情况是你可以向中国出售芯片，但有15%的出口税。但现在看来，中国人可能因为美国的一些言论而感到冒犯，他们说不，不许英伟达在这里销售。那么今天英伟达和中国之间处于什么状况？你能重申一下你认为我们作为一个国家应该怎么做，才能让自己处于赢得全球AI竞赛的最佳位置吗？

We have a competitive relationship with China. We should acknowledge that China rightfully should want their companies to do well. We I don't I don't for a second begrudge them for them. They should do well. They should they should give them as much support as they like. It's all their prerogative. And don't forget that China has some of the best entrepreneurs in the world because they came from some of the best STEM schools in the world. They're they're the most hungry in the world. Yes. 996 as you know. This is a very producing the most AI engineers in the world. 96. So the audience knows 9 in the morning to 9 at night 6 days a week. That is their culture. Yeah. Okay. We're up against a formidable, innovative, hungry, fastm moving, underregulated. Yeah. Okay. People don't realize this. They are very lightly regulated, right? Less regulated, ironically, than we are in a capitalist system. That's right. People think that they're centrally governed. But remember, the genius of China was distributed economic systems. Yeah. And so all of these 33 provinces and all the mayor economy has driven enormous amount of internal competition, internal economic vibrancy, which of course has some of its side effects. But this is a vibrant, entrepreneurial, high techch, modern industry. And two, one, uh, some of the things I I heard, uh, they could never build AI chips. That just sounded insane. Two, uh, that China can't manufacture. China can't manufacture. If there's one thing they could do is manufacture. And three, they're years behind us. Is it two years, three years? Come on. They're nanconds behind us. Yeah, they're nanconds behind us. And so we've got to go compete. Yeah. we've got to go compete.

我们与中国存在竞争关系。我们应该承认，中国理应希望他们的公司做得好。我一秒钟都不会因此而责怪他们。他们应该做得好。他们应该给予他们喜欢的支持。这是他们的特权。别忘了，中国拥有世界上最优秀的创业者之一，因为他们来自世界上最好的STEM学校。他们是世界上最渴望成功的。是的，你知道的，996。这是世界上培养AI工程师最多的国家。96。所以听众知道，早上9点到晚上9点，一周6天。这是他们的文化。是的。好吧。我们面对的是一个强大、创新、渴望、快速发展、监管不足的……是的。好吧。人们没有意识到这一点。他们的监管非常宽松，对吧？具有讽刺意味的是，比我们在资本主义体系中受到的监管还要少。没错。人们认为他们是中央政府管理的。但请记住，中国的独到之处在于分散的经济体系。是的。所以这33个省份和所有市级经济推动了巨大的内部竞争和经济活力，这当然带来了一些负面影响。但这是一个充满活力、创业、高科技、现代化的产业。第二，我听到一些说法，他们永远造不出AI芯片。这听起来太荒谬了。第二，中国不会制造。中国是会制造的。如果说有一件事他们能做到，那就是制造。第三，他们比我们落后了好几年。是两年，三年吗？算了吧。他们只落后我们纳秒级别。是的，他们只落后我们纳秒级别。所以我们必须去竞争。是的，我们必须去竞争。

### 中国的市场偏好与美国的战略目标

And so so the question then becomes um what's in the best interest uh what's in the best interest of China of course um is that they have a vibrant industry. Uh they also publicly say and rightfully I believe they believe this is that they want China to be an open market. They want to attract uh foreign investment. They want companies to come to China and compete in the marketplace, right? And I believe that they I hope I believe that would return to that in our context. Answering your question, what do I see in the future? I do hope because they they say it um their leaders say it and I take it at face value and I believe it because I think it makes sense for China that what's in the best interest of China is for foreign companies to invest in China, compete in China and for them to also have vibrant competition themselves and they would also like to come out of China and participate around the world. That is I think is a fairly sensible outcome and we what we need to do as a country is to enable our technology industry which today is the I'm privileged to be working in an industry that is our national treasure. We have to acknowledge it is our national treasure. It is our best industry. Yeah. Why would we not allow this industry to go compete for its survival for for this industry to go and proliferate the technology around the world so that we could have the world be built on top of American technology so that we can maximize our economic success magn uh maximize our geopolitical influence u maximize this this technology industry during such a vibrant time such a pivotal time to allow it to thrive.

所以问题就变成了，对中国最有利的是什么？当然，对中国最有利的是他们拥有一个充满活力的产业。他们也公开宣称，而且我相信他们也这样认为，他们希望中国成为一个开放的市场。他们希望吸引外国投资。他们希望公司来中国竞争，对吧？我希望，在我们的背景下，我会回到这一点。回答你的问题，我未来看到了什么？我希望，因为他们说了，他们的领导人说了，我完全相信，因为我认为这对中国来说是合理的：对中国最有利的是外国公司投资中国、在中国竞争，并且他们自己也有充满活力的竞争，他们也希望走出去，参与全球竞争。我认为这是一个相当合理的结局，而我们作为一个国家需要做的是赋能我们的技术产业，今天我非常荣幸能在一个被视为国家宝藏的行业工作。我们必须承认它是我们的国家宝藏。它是我们最好的产业。是的。我们为什么不让这个产业出去竞争求生，让这个产业在全世界推广技术，这样我们就能让世界建立在**的**技术之上，这样我们就能最大限度地发挥我们的经济成功，最大限度地发挥我们的地缘政治影响力，在这个充满活力、关键的时刻，最大限度地发挥这个技术产业的潜力，让它蓬勃发展。

### 驳斥“中国放缓论”与对华政策的务实态度

The skeptic says Jensen just wants to sell more chips and if he can sell them to China, great. He'll sell them to China. He doesn't care about, you know, what that means for America. That's a skeptic. Now, can I just can I just address the skeptics? Just because I want America in ecosystem and economy to grow doesn't make me wrong. Right. Right. So, first of all, everything that has been said so far that's been made up so far about U. China has proven to be wrong. The facts are just wrong. The ground truth is wrong. And so just because we want America to win, just because we want this industry to grow, doesn't make me wrong. Correct. And I think anybody who knows you and now the president, certainly myself, you deeply care about the country. You deeply want the United States of America to win the global AI race. You just happen to believe and I think you have as much experience or more experience than anyone that it enures to our advantage the probability of us winning the global AI race actually goes up if you are competing in China because it allows us to tap into half of the world's AI engineers keeping them you know in this ecos let's be clear with the companies we're talking about here bite dance Alibaba etc these are companies that are largely owned by American investors Yeah. Right. Like these are global companies that are building recommender engines that by the way extraordinary technologies, incredible companies. And so I think and I'm hopeful that the argument that you're making visav China, which is a harder argument than diffusion to the rest of the world. I understand that. And that's why I thought when the president said, you know, I don't know, it's a flip of a coin. Maybe Jensen's right. Maybe the other guys are right. If Jensen's willing to put a little bit of 15% into the US Treasury as a hedge on that, then I'll go for it. Um, but I was really disappointed on the heels of that. Mhm. Um, I think if the Chinese feel like they're being taken advantage of that we're going to send them chips that are, you know, 10 years old or something, then I then I get why why they had that response.

怀疑论者会说，黄仁勋只是想卖更多的芯片，如果他能卖给中国，那太好了。他会卖给中国，他不在乎这对美国意味着什么。这是怀疑论者的观点。现在，我能反驳一下怀疑论者吗？仅仅因为我想让美国的生态系统和经济增长，并不能说明我是错的。对。对。首先，到目前为止关于中美的一切臆测都被证明是错误的。事实就是错误的。基本事实是错误的。所以，仅仅因为我们想让美国获胜，仅仅因为我们想让这个行业增长，并不能说明我是错的。正确。我认为任何了解你和现在这位总统的人，当然也包括我自己，都知道你非常关心这个国家。你非常希望美国赢得全球AI竞赛。你只是碰巧相信——而且我认为你的经验和任何人一样多，甚至更多——如果我们与中国竞争，我们赢得全球AI竞赛的概率实际上会增加，因为它使我们能够接触到全球一半的AI工程师，让他们……让我们明确一点，我们在这里谈论的公司，如字节跳动、阿里巴巴等，这些公司很大程度上由美国投资者拥有。是的。对吧？就像这些全球性的公司正在构建推荐引擎，顺便说一句，它们拥有非凡的技术，是了不起的公司。所以我认为，我希望你提出的关于中国的论点，这个论点比向世界其他地方推广（技术）要困难得多。我理解这一点。这就是为什么我想，当总统说，“我不知道，这就像抛硬币。也许黄仁勋是对的。也许其他人是对的。如果黄仁勋愿意拿一点15%的利润作为对冲，投入到美国国库，那我就支持他。”但在此之后，我感到非常失望。Mhm。我想如果中国人觉得他们被占了便宜，认为我们要卖给他们10年前的芯片或什么的，那么我理解他们为什么会有那样的反应。

### 维持市场准入与美国利益的平衡

H20 is really quite spectacular still. And I of course it it's it's not as good as Blackwell and and I get that. Yeah. Um I look, you know, we're I'm patient and and I believe that they're they're wise. They're thinking through their situation. Um they they have they have larger agendas to to deal with um rel you know visibly uh the United States. There are a lot of discussions going on. But I'll come back to the ground truth fundamental truth. I believe that is in the best interest of China that Nvidia is able to serve that market and compete in that market. I fundamentally believe is in the best interest of China. It is of course um fantastic in the fantastic interest of the United States. Yeah. it is fun. But those two truths can coexist. It is possible for both to be true and I believe it is both true. And so I I um uh I I'm rather, you know, even though I tell all of our investors Yeah. that our guidance includes no China. Yeah. And I appreciate all of our investors to include no China in any of our guidance. We've got plenty of growth opportunities outside and we you know we've got all of that is true. It doesn't make China not important to us. It's very important to us. Anybody who thinks that the Chinese market is not important is has their head deep in the sand. And so this is s one of the most important markets in the world. Smart markets as you know, smart people doing smart things and we want to be there. Yeah. And I think it's in the best interest of both countries that we are there. And so I think when I take a step back, I am confident that ultimately the wisdom will prevail. Yes. Yes. I've I've always been confident that wisdom prevails. I've always been confident that that truth prevails and uh it's taken me this far and uh I believe I believe that to be fundamentally true now. And so these things will get sorted out and we will have the opportunity to go compete in that China market.

H20 仍然非常出色。当然，它不如 Blackwell 好，我理解这一点。是的。你看，我很耐心，我相信他们很明智。他们正在思考他们的情况。他们有更大的议程需要处理，尤其是在明显地……与美国有关。有很多讨论正在进行。但我会回到基本事实，根本的真相。我相信，对中国最有利的是英伟达能够服务那个市场并在那个市场竞争。我从根本上相信这对中国最有利。当然，这对美国也极其有利。是的，很有趣。但这两个事实可以共存。两者都有可能是真的，我相信两者都是真的。所以我……尽管我告诉我们所有的投资者，我们的指引中不包括中国。是的。我感谢我们所有的投资者，将不包括中国的内容纳入我们的指引中。我们在海外有充足的增长机会，我们……你知道，所有这些都是事实。这并不意味着中国对我们不重要。它对我们非常重要。任何认为中国市场不重要的人都是在自欺欺人。所以，这是世界上最重要的市场之一。你知道，聪明的市场，聪明的人做聪明的事，我们想在那里。是的。我认为我们身处其中符合两国利益。所以我想，当我退后一步看时，我有信心，最终智慧会占上风。是的。是的。我一直相信智慧会占上风。我一直相信真理会占上风，它带我走到了今天，我相信这从根本上是真的。所以这些事情会得到解决，我们将有机会去中国市场竞争。

### H1B签证费与美国梦的维护

I'm not very political, but very topical is the administration's decision to charge 100,000 per H1B visa. Mhm. You've spent a lot of time with the president. Um you've called him our secret weapon in AI. I also know you want to recruit the best and brightest to our country. Yeah. So, how do you think about the decision to charge 100,000 per H1B visa? Does this make it easier or harder to recruit talent? And, you know, does perhaps it's a little different for large companies or small companies? Like, how do you think about it? I'm going to start with it's a great start. Hold on. You said it's a great start. It's a great start. I'm just going to start there. And the reason for that is this. That implies I don't I hope it's not the end, but I think it's a great start. I just hope it's not the end. Here's what I fundamentally believe. America has one a singular brand reputation that no country in the world has. And no country in the world is in a position or in the horizon to be able to say come to America and realize the American dream. M what country has the word dream behind it? Yes, it's part of its brand. We are utterly singular and you're talking to somebody who represents the American dream. My parents didn't have any money. Sent us over here. We started from nothing. You guys know I, you know, bust tables, wash dishes, clean toilets, and here I am. Yeah. This is the American dream. President Trump knows that we want legal immigrants. Yeah. There's a difference between legal immigrants and illegal immigrants. But the idea that it's a country that's free for all doesn't make sense. And so now the question is how do we go from the the idea that we want to protect fundamentally the American dream to dealing with illegal immigrants at such a large scale? Um how do we find a logical pragmatic solution? Right? So, the idea that he that that that we put a $100,000 price tag on H-1B um probably sets the bar a little too high, but as a first bar, it at least eliminates um illegal immigration, and that's a good start.

我不太关心政治，但一个非常热门的话题是政府决定对H1B签证收取10万美元的费用。Mhm。你和总统共度了很多时光。你称他为我们在AI方面的秘密武器。我也知道你想招募我们国家最优秀、最聪明的人才。所以，你如何看待收取10万美元/H1B签证的决定？这会使招募人才变得更容易还是更难？你知道，这对大公司或小公司来说可能略有不同吗？你是怎么想的？我将从“这是一个好的开始”开始。等等。你说这是一个好的开始。这是一个好的开始。我先从这里说起。原因如下：这意味着……我希望这不是结束，但我认为这是一个好的开始。我只希望它不是结束。以下是我的基本信念：美国拥有一个任何国家都无法比拟的独特品牌声誉。世界上没有任何国家处于能够说“来美国实现美国梦”的位置或前景。哪个国家的名字后面带有“梦想”这个词？是的，这是其品牌的一部分。我们是绝对独特的，你正在与一个代表美国梦的人交谈。我的父母身无分文，把我们送到这里。我们白手起家。你们知道我，我端过盘子，洗过碗，擦过厕所，但现在我站在这里了。是的。这就是美国梦。特朗普总统知道我们想要合法移民。是的。合法移民和非法移民是有区别的。但“这是一个对所有人开放的国家”的想法是不合理的。所以现在的问题是，我们如何从我们想要从根本上保护美国梦的想法出发，去处理如此大规模的非法移民问题？我们如何找到一个合乎逻辑、务实的解决方案？对吧？所以，他们对H-1B设置10万美元的价格标签可能把门槛设得太高了，但作为第一个门槛，它至少消除了对H1B的滥用，这是一个好的开始。

How does it how does it eliminate illegal immigration? Well, it at least it eliminates abuse of abuse of H-1B. Yeah. Yeah. At least. And and that's a good start. and at least we can have a conversation. So, one of the things that we know about President Trump, he's he he's a good listener. He actually listens. I mean, he listens to you, he listens to me, and he doesn't have to. And he listens to a lot of people, and he's integrating a lot of information, and this is obviously a very complicated issue. And so, so I think that that this is a fine start. It's a fine start. But I I I'm not confused that that anyone in the administration, anyone in the White House is confused that legal immigration, immigration is the foundation of the American dream and is the ultimate brand that we want to protect and that's the future we want to protect.

这如何消除非法移民？嗯，至少它消除了对H1B的滥用。是的。至少这是一个好的开始，我们可以进行对话。我们对特朗普总统的了解之一是，他是一个好的倾听者。他真的会听。我的意思是，他会听你的，他会听我的，但他不必听。他听取很多人的意见，他正在整合很多信息，这显然是一个非常复杂的问题。所以，我认为这是一个好的开始。这是一个好的开始。但我并不困惑，行政部门的任何人、白宫的任何人，会对合法移民是美国梦的基础、是我们想要保护的终极品牌、是我们想要保护的未来这一点感到困惑。

### 吸引顶尖人才与对初创企业的影响

And I would also say it seems to me that certainly Saxs and other people in the administration know that we have to recruit the world's best and brightest. we should not sacrifice the greatness of the brand. Um, charging $100,000 or let's say, you know, it got lowered to 50 or whatever the case is, it does seem like it it it it tilts the playing field in favor of big companies who can effectively sponsor all these people, right? And it's more challenging for the startup ecosystem where people are already super expensive and now I got to pay this fee on top of it. It also has an un an unintended consequence. It might um accelerate investment outside United States, right? And so there there are unintended consequences, but like I said, start somewhere, move towards the right answer, right? You know, often times people want to go directly from a wrong answer, wrong condition. We don't want this condition where we're at, right? And directly jump to the perfect answer is hard to find, right? Just start somewhere. It's the entrepreneurial way. It's important to me, you know, the president talked about before when he was running for office, he wanted to staple a green card to the, you know, to the diplomas of these STEM students. so smart people coming to the United States from from China AI researchers studying at Stanford like we want to keep them here we want to get you know and by the way if their families can't get here they're going to leave after a few years so you might even want to make it easier for their families to come here and others are you confident that we have a strategic plan in this administration you know this is a start but your conversations they give you confidence that we have a broader strategic plan to make sure we're recruiting the best and the brightest.

我也要说，在我看来，萨克斯和政府中的其他人肯定知道，我们必须招募世界上最优秀、最聪明的人才。我们不应该牺牲品牌的伟大。收取10万美元，或者比如降到5万或任何情况，这确实似乎让那些能够有效担保所有这些人的大公司受益，对吧？这对初创企业生态系统来说更具挑战性，因为那里的员工已经非常昂贵了，现在我还要支付这笔费用。它还会带来一个意想不到的后果。它可能会加速美国以外地区的投资，对吧？所以存在意想不到的后果，但就像我说的，从某个地方开始，朝着正确的答案前进，对吧？人们通常想直接从错误的答案、错误的情况跳跃到完美的答案是很难找到的，对吧？只是从某个地方开始。这是创业的方式。对我来说很重要，你知道，总统在竞选时就提到过，他想把绿卡钉在这些STEM学生的文凭上。所以像来自中国的聪明人、在斯坦福学习的AI研究人员，我们想让他们留在这里，你知道，顺便说一句，如果他们的家人无法来这里，他们几年后就会离开，所以你甚至可能想让他们的家人更容易来这里。其他人呢？你对这个政府有一个战略计划有信心吗？你知道，这是一个开始，但你的谈话让你有信心我们有一个更广泛的战略计划，以确保我们正在招募最优秀、最聪明的人才。

I don't know that I have an answer for that. Okay. Um but I understand that where we're at is not where we want to be. Yeah. And I don't think anybody's lost lost their focus on, you know, the American dream, the importance of immigration, the importance of attracting all of the world's best talent to United States, create the conditions for them to stay here. I there are things that are done um from time to time that works against what I just described, right? Um making making foreign students uncomfortable, right, and being here in the brand threatens the brand. Um uh let's not let's not forget that that it's okay to be competitive with China, but be careful not to be tough on Chinese. And so we need to make sure that that slippery slope isn't crossed. Yeah. Um, you know, and so there there all of these things that goes along with with finesse and nuance. But the fact of the matter is we know where we want to be. We know we're in a difficult situation. We don't want to be here and President Trump doesn't have much time to move us in that direction. Right. And so to the extent that we move in that direction, I believe it's a good start. Agreed.

我不知道我是否有答案。好的。但我明白我们现在的位置不是我们想要的位置。是的。而且我认为没有人会失去对美国梦、移民重要性、吸引全世界最优秀人才来美国并为他们创造留下来的条件的关注。不时地会做一些事情，与我刚才描述的背道而驰，对吧？让外国学生感到不舒服，对吧？而且留在这里对品牌是一种威胁。我们不要忘记，与中国竞争是可以的，但要小心不要对中国人过于严苛。所以我们需要确保不会越过那条滑坡。是的。你知道，所有这些都伴随着技巧和细微差别。但事实是，我们知道我们想去哪里。我们知道我们处于一个困难的境地。我们不想待在这里，而特朗普总统没有多少时间将我们引向那个方向。对吧？所以，在一定程度上，如果我们朝着那个方向前进，我相信这是一个好的开始。同意。

### 顶尖人才流失的警示

Yeah. I heard from a Chinese researcher leading one of our leading labs in the US that three years ago 90% of the top AI researchers graduating from universities in China wanted to come to the United States and did come to the United States to work in our leading labs and he guessed that today that's closer to 10 or 15%. Right? So seen a precipitous drop. That's precisely a concern that we have, right? So have you seen this? Have you you you know you're you're paying attention to both markets. Do you see this? And what are the things we need to do in order to reverse that? Definitely see a greater concern of of Chinese students um who who come here and um uh remain here. Yeah. and or many of them who come here for for school and are thinking about going elsewhere, right? Many of them thinking about Europe, right? And so so I think I think we need to be super super concerned about this. This is this is this is a source of existential crisis. This is definitely the early indicators of a future problem. Right. Right. you know, smart people's desire to come to to America and smart people smart students desire to stay, those are what I would call KPIs. Yes. Early indicators of future success. Yes. I think of it a bit like the Warriors. You know, if they have an advantage of recruiting all the best players in the NBA, right, then they can continue to win championships. Y, but the second that recruiting pipeline, right, because of the brand of the Warriors gets diminished or something else happens, um, then they're not going to be able to recruit the best future players and you're not going to win championships. And when I you talk about the American dream so eloquently, that being brand USA, right? The right to come here and to to do what you've done. And you know, so I hope that the feedback to this administration, it's not just the administration, it's also just how we as a country talk about immigration. That's right. Right. This needs to be the place that welcomes the best and the brightest, that attracts, has a strategic plan for recruiting the best and the brightest and making sure that this is the place that they want to work.

我从一位领导我们美国顶尖实验室的中国研究人员那里听说，三年前，从中国大学毕业的顶尖AI研究人员中有90%想来美国，并且确实来美国在我们顶尖实验室工作，他估计今天这个数字更接近10%或15%。对吧？看到了急剧下降。这正是我们关注的担忧，对吧？你看到这种情况了吗？你关注着这两个市场。你看到了吗？我们需要做什么来扭转这种局面？确实看到了中国学生来这里并留在这里的担忧越来越大。或者他们中许多人来这里上学，然后考虑去别处，对吧？他们中许多人考虑去欧洲，对吧？所以，我认为我们需要对这种情况非常非常担忧。这是生存危机的根源。这绝对是未来问题的早期指标。对。对。你知道，聪明人渴望来到美国，聪明学生渴望留下，这些就是我所说的关键绩效指标（KPI）。是的，未来成功的早期指标。是的。我把它比作勇士队。如果你有能力招募NBA所有最优秀的球员，对吧？那么你就能继续赢得总冠军。但是，如果因为勇士队的品牌而削弱了招募渠道，或者发生了其他事情，那么他们将无法招募到未来最优秀的球员，你也无法赢得总冠军。当你如此雄辩地谈论美国梦时，那就是品牌美国，对吧？来这里并成就一番事业的权利。所以我希望给这个政府的反馈，不只是政府，也是我们作为一个国家如何谈论移民。没错。对。这里需要成为一个欢迎最优秀、最聪明人才的地方，要吸引、要有一个招募最优秀、最聪明人才的战略计划，并确保这里是他们想工作的地方。

### 告诫“对华强硬派”：竞争与友善并行

As you know, there's in in there's a there's a phrase, and I didn't hear about this phrase until just a few years ago, China hawks. Yes. And and apparently that if you're a China hawk, you get to wear that label with pride. It's almost like a badge of honor, right? It's a badge of shame. There's no question it's a badge of shame. There's no question that although they want what's in the best interest of our country, and we all want what's in the best interest of our country, um destroying that pipeline, right, of the American dream, yeah, is not patriotic, right? They they think they think they're doing the right thing for our country, but it's not patriotic. Not Not even a little bit. And so we we need to um continue to be uh the great country we are, to have the confidence, right, of a great country. Yes. Well said. And to have the confidence of a great country and and have somebody who wants to compete with us and to have the attitude, bring it on. Right. Right. Bring it on. Right. because I believe in I believe in our people. I believe in our people. I believe in the people that are here. I believe in our culture. I believe in our country. I believe in our system. Bring it on. And is it your take that that's where the president is? Like he's a he's a pragmatist. He's a he's a believer in the growth and the ability of the United States to compete. Um it seems to me that's where he is. There's no question President Trump is the bring it on president. Right. Right. And he doesn't seem to me like the reason I'm confident and I've said on this pod that I think he'll get a big deal done with China. I I really really do hope so. Yeah. And and I think he he speaks he he speaks positively um uh uh with great respect and um great eloquence about about his relationship and the importance of China. Uh, not one time have I ever heard him say the word decouple, which we heard a lot in the last administration, right? Um, you can't decouple against um the single most the two most important relationships for the next century. That doesn't make any sense at all. Decoupling is exactly the wrong concept. Right?

你知道，有这样一个词，我几年前才听到，叫“对华强硬派”。是的。显然，如果你是一个对华强硬派，你会以之为荣。这几乎就像一枚荣誉徽章，对吧？这是一枚耻辱的徽章。毫无疑问，这是一枚耻辱的徽章。毫无疑问，尽管他们想要对我国最有利的东西，我们所有人都想要对我国最有利的东西，但摧毁美国梦的这个渠道，对吧？是的，那是不爱国的，对吧？他们认为他们正在为我们的国家做正确的事情，但这不爱国。一点都不爱国。所以我们需要继续做我们伟大的国家，拥有一个伟大国家的信心，对吧？是的。说得好。拥有一个伟大国家的信心，并让一个想与我们竞争的人拥有“放马过来”的态度。对。对。放马过来。因为我相信我们的人民，我相信这里的人民。我相信我们的文化。我相信我们的国家。我相信我们的制度。放马过来。你的看法是总统也是这种态度吗？他是个实用主义者。他相信美国的增长和竞争力。我认为他就是这样。毫无疑问，特朗普总统是“放马过来”的总统。对。对。他给我的感觉不是……我之所以有信心，并且在这个播客上说过，我认为他会与中国达成一笔大交易。我真的非常希望如此。是的。而且我认为他说话……他对中国的重要性表达了积极的看法，带有极大的尊重和极高的口才。我从未听他说过“脱钩”这个词，这是我们在上届政府听到的很多。你不能反对……对未来一个世纪最重要的两个关系进行“脱钩”。这完全说不通。“脱钩”恰恰是错误的理念。对吧？

I mean, it seems to me he and Scott Besson are saying, "Listen, we need to make America great. We need to re-industrialize America. We need to balance and make sure that we have fair trade. Um that we protect industries that we need to help build that China helps us do that recognizing that we have helped them do it over the course of the last 25 years. But that ultimately he said the best way to understand me is I'm a great dealmaker. I make deals right whereas I think in other camps there are people who are iconoclastic or dogmatic. Uh you know it's the mere shimer view of China that there's a great power struggle. one was must win and one must lose versus this idea the idea that every country has to look exactly like ours, right? You know, and we we want diversity. You want America to win, but that doesn't have to come at the expense of poking an eye and telling somebody else they have to lose because we're that confident. Yeah, we're that confident. Because we're that mighty. Because we're that incredible. I've got no trouble, as you know, I've got no trouble working with all my colleagues in the ecosystem, right? And notice we just did the ultimate deal, right? Partnering with Intel, a company that spent most of its life trying to put us out of business, right? And I had no trouble partnering with them, right? You know, and so, and the reason for that is because number one, bring it on. Yes. And number two, the future is so much greater. It doesn't have to be all us or them. It could be us and them. Yeah. Yeah. But nonetheless, bring it on. Yeah. Agreed.

在我看来，他和斯科特·贝森（Scott Besson）的意思是：“听着，我们需要让美国再次伟大。我们需要让美国再工业化。我们需要平衡，确保我们有公平的贸易，保护我们需要帮助建设的产业，中国帮助我们做到这一点，同时承认我们在过去25年里也帮助了他们。但最终他说，理解我的最好方式是，我是一个伟大的交易者，我做交易，对吧？而在其他阵营中，我认为有些人是反传统的或教条的。你知道，这是那种认为中国存在一场你死我活的大国之争的观点，与这种观点相反——即每个国家都必须看起来和我们一模一样，对吧？你知道，我们想要多样性。你希望美国获胜，但这不一定以戳人眼睛、告诉别人他们必须失败为代价，因为我们足够自信。是的，我们足够自信。因为我们如此强大，如此不可思议。你知道，我与生态系统中所有的同事合作都没有任何问题，对吧？请注意，我们刚刚做成了终极交易，对吧？与英特尔合作，这家公司大部分时间都在试图让我们破产，对吧？我与他们合作没有问题，对吧？你知道，原因如下：第一，放马过来。是的。第二，未来更加广阔。它不必是我们赢或他们输，也可以是我们和他们。是的。是的。但尽管如此，放马过来。是的。同意。

### 投资美国：让每个孩子都成为股东

You mentioned something that's profoundly important to both of us. You and I have talked a lot about this, the American dream, you know, and it was, I think, Abraham Lincoln who said, "Fundamental to the American dream is the right to rise." Yeah. That's right. The belief that your kids can do better than you did. That's right. Right. And you you've experienced the right to rise. We've all experienced the right to rise in America. So, yeah, you go to Wikipedia, you look up American dreams, my picture, right? Yeah. And the ultimate American dream. And yet we live at this time where because of the nature of these technological systems, we have companies that are going to be worth 10 trillion. We'll probably have individuals that are worth a trillion. Those are the incentives that give people the the encouragement to rise. But at the same time, when we head into this age of abundance, something that I was deeply worried about was that too many people get left behind. Yeah. Right. And they feel left out and left behind. So it makes sense for them to attack this system of capitalism. Something that you and I worked on together and I'm deeply grateful for was the idea of invest America that we have to start every kid at birth on the capitalist right to rise journey give them a thousand bucks in great companies like Nvidia social security and and and open a high etc. Um and they benefit right as the as the comp country wins they win and they own it individually they can see it on their every kid is a shareholder in the future of America of America. So on the 200 because of your support and I wanted to take the chance on this podcast and the support.

你提到了对我们两人都非常重要的事情。你我经常谈论美国梦，我想是亚伯拉罕·林肯说过，“美国梦的根本在于上升的权利。”是的。没错。相信你的孩子可以比你做得更好。没错。对。你经历了上升的权利。我们在美国都经历了上升的权利。所以，你去维基百科上查一下“美国梦”，我的照片就在那里，对吧？是的，终极的美国梦。然而，我们生活在这个时代，由于这些技术系统的性质，我们将会有价值10万亿美元的公司。我们可能还会有身价万亿美元的个人。这些都是激励人们上升的动力。但同时，当我们进入这个富足的时代时，我非常担心的一件事是，太多人会掉队。是的。对吧？他们感到被排斥和抛弃。所以他们攻击这个资本主义制度是合理的。你我一起合作过，我深表感激的是“投资美国”的想法，即我们必须让每个孩子从出生起就踏上资本主义的上升之旅，给他们1000美元投资于像英伟达这样的伟大公司，社保等等。他们受益，当国家获胜时他们也获胜，他们拥有这些股份，每个孩子都是美国未来的股东。所以，因为你的支持，我想借这个播客的机会，以及支持……

### 投资美国法案的通过与社会契约的演变

Well, I want to thank you for starting it, for driving it. Yeah. Yeah. What a great idea. And you know, so this you're a genius. Please this passed in the big beautiful bill. Most people don't even realize that yet. Starting in 2026, every child born forever more in the history of this country will start off with an investment account at birth. Yeah. Seen a thousand bucks in the best American companies and your company has agreed to add to the accounts of not only the kids who work for your employees but maybe even kids of others. I'm going to adopt schools, you know, and lots of philanthropists and companies. We think every company across America wonderful way for companies to give back, right? Yeah. as part of the 401k. This seems to me to be part of the change in the social contract that needs to occur because if if we're seeing this exponential progress, we know that the the evolution of government in the social contract needs to keep up with it. Um obviously President Trump and and bipartisan group in the House and Senate passed this into law. So maybe just talk to us a little bit when you think about the the pace and magnitude of changes that are coming, right? Um I know you believe it will be a net good, but there also going to be a bunch of people displaced along the way. We probably need things like this and other things, right? In order to, you know, bring everybody along for the journey. There's several things that that President Trump has done and let me just start start there has done that is incredibly good for bringing everybody along. The first thing is reindustrializing America. Yeah. President Trump, Secretary Lutnik, the you know they're all in behind that all the work that they're doing encouraging companies to come build here in the United States, investing in factories and uh reskilling and upskilling that skilled labor workforce, right? Incredibly valuable to our country. Um the idea that that we no longer uh uh uh make it only that you get a PhD or you go to you know one of the great schools and only in that way can you build a great life right and and deserve to have a great living uh we've got to change all that doesn't make any sense we love craft right I love people who make things with their hands and and we're now we're now going to go back and build things build magnificent incredible things I love that yes that's going to transform form America. There's no question about that. There's a whole there's a whole a whole band of an economy, a whole band of society that that um uh has been largely left behind because we outsourced everything, right? Now, I'm not suggesting we insource everything, right? You know, all the people arguing about, you know, manufacturing tennis shoes and toothpicks, I mean, you know, that's that's denigrating a perfectly good discussion into some insane level. You know, we we've got to um recognize that re-industrializ reindustrializing America is is just fundamentally going to be transform transformative number one. Number two, and aspirational. Oh, it's fantastic.

好吧，我想感谢你发起它，推动它。是的。真是个好主意。你知道，你真是个天才。请注意，这项法案已经通过了，大多数人甚至还没有意识到这一点。从2026年开始，这个国家历史上此后出生的每一个孩子，从出生起就将拥有一个投资账户。是的。给他们1000美元投资于美国最好的公司，你的公司同意为不仅为你员工的孩子，甚至可能为其他人的孩子增加资金。我要收养学校，还有很多慈善家和公司。我们认为美国所有的公司……这是一个很好的回馈方式，对吧？是的。作为401k的一部分。这似乎是我认为需要发生的那种社会契约变革的一部分，因为如果我们看到这种指数级的进步，我们就知道政府在社会契约中的演变需要跟上。特朗普总统和国会两党都通过了这项法律。所以，当我们想到即将到来的变化的步伐和规模时，请和我们谈谈，对吧？我知道你相信这将是净收益，但在这个过程中也会有很多人失业。我们可能需要像这样的东西以及其他东西，对吧？为了让每个人都跟上这次旅程。特朗普总统做了一些非常好的事情，让我从那里开始，让每个人都跟上来。第一件事是让美国再工业化。是的。特朗普总统、卢特尼克部长，他们都在支持所有这些工作，鼓励公司来美国建厂，投资工厂，并对熟练劳动力进行再培训和技能提升，对吧？这对我们的国家非常有价值。我们不再只认为只有获得博士学位或上最好的学校才能过上美好的生活，对吧？我们必须改变这一点，这没有意义。我们热爱工艺，我热爱那些用双手创造东西的人，我们现在要回去建造宏伟、不可思议的东西，我喜欢这一点。是的，这将改变美国。毫无疑问。有一大批经济体、社会的一部分，在很大程度上被抛在了后面，因为我们把一切都外包了，对吧？现在，我不是说要把一切都内包回来，对吧？你知道，那些争论制造网球鞋和牙签的人，我的意思是，你不能把一个完全合理的讨论贬低到某种疯狂的程度。我们必须认识到，让美国再工业化将从根本上具有变革性，这是第一点。第二点，也是鼓舞人心的。哦，太棒了。

### AI作为最大的均衡器和人类的未来

Elon taking us to Mars, watching spaceships caught with, you know, uh chopsticks out of the sky. This is not only great for the industrializing base of America, it's aspirational for Fantastic. That's right. And then and then, uh, of course AI. Yeah, it is the greatest equalizer. Just think everybody can have an AI now. The the ultimate equalizer. We've closed the technology divide. Remember the last time that somebody had to learn has wants to use a computer uh for their economic um or career benefit. They have to learn C++ or C or at least Python. Now they just have to learn human, you know. And so, and if you don't know how to program an AI, you tell the AI, "Hi, I don't know how to program an AI. How do I program an AI?" And the AI explains it to you or does it for you. It does it for you. And so, it's incredible, isn't that right? It's And we've now closed the technology divide with technology. Yeah. This is something that every everybody's got to engage. You know, OpenAI has 800 million active users. Um gosh, it really really needs to be 6 billion. Yeah. Right. It really needs to be 8 billion soon. And so so I think that that's number one. Then number two, uh and then number three, you know, I think the the um AI will change tasks. Yeah. The thing that people confuse is there are many tasks that will be eliminated. There are many tasks that will actually be created. But it is very likely that for many people their jobs are gainfully protected. Right. And so, for example, I'm using AI all the time. You're using AI all the time. My analysts are using AI all the time. My engineers, every one of them use AI continuously. And we're hiring more engineers. We're hiring more people. We're hiring across the board. The reason for that is because we have more ideas. Yes, we can now go pursue more ideas. The reason for that is because our company became more productive. And because we became more productive, we became more rich. We became more rich, we can hire more people to go after those ideas, right? The I the concept that that AI comes along and therefore there's going to be a mass destruction of jobs starts with the I starts with the premise that we have no more ideas. Right. It starts with the premise we have nothing left to do. Everything we're doing in our lives today. Yeah. This is the end. Yeah. And if somebody else were to do that one task for me, I have one task left. Now I have to sit there and wait for something. Yes. You know, wait for retirement, sit on my rocking chair. That idea doesn't make sense to me. And so I think I think that intelligence is not a zero sum game. The more intelligent people I'm surrounded by, the more geniuses I'm surrounded by, surprisingly, the more ideas I have, the more problems I imagine that we can go solve, the more work we create, the more jobs we create. And so I think for for um I don't know what the world looks like in a million years that's going to be left for my my children. Um but for the next several decades, my sense is that economy is going to grow. Lots of new jobs are going to be created. Every job will be changed. Some job some jobs will be lost. And um uh we're not going to be, you know, riding horses on streets and those things it'll be fine. You know, humans are are famously skeptical and terrible at understanding compounding systems and they're even worse at understanding exponential systems that accelerate with size.

埃隆把我们带到火星，看着宇宙飞船用筷子从天空中接住碎片。这不仅对美国的工业基础有益，也鼓舞人心。太棒了。你说得对。然后，当然还有AI。是的，它是最大的均衡器。想象一下，每个人现在都可以拥有一个AI。终极的均衡器。我们消除了技术鸿沟。还记得上一次有人为了职业发展或经济利益想使用计算机时，他们必须学习C++、C或至少是Python吗？现在他们只需要学习人性化的语言，对吧？所以，如果你不知道如何编程AI，你就告诉AI：“嗨，我不知道如何编程AI。我该怎么编程AI？”AI就会向你解释，或者为你完成。它会为你完成。所以，这太不可思议了，不是吗？我们已经用技术消除了技术鸿沟。是的。这是每个人都必须参与的事情。你知道，OpenAI有8亿活跃用户。天哪，它真的需要达到60亿。是的。它很快就需要达到80亿。所以，我认为这是第一点。然后是第二点，第三点，我认为AI将改变任务。人们混淆的一点是，许多任务将被消除，但也会创造许多任务。但对于许多人来说，他们的工作很可能得到了保障。对吧？例如，我一直在使用AI。你一直在使用AI。我的分析师一直在使用AI。我的每一位工程师都在持续使用AI。我们正在招聘更多的工程师。我们正在招聘更多的人，全方位地招聘。原因是我们有了更多的想法。是的，我们现在可以去追求更多的想法。原因是我们公司变得更有生产力了。因为我们更有生产力，所以我们变得更富有。我们更富有，我们可以雇佣更多的人去追求那些想法，对吧？AI出现并导致大规模失业的这个概念，其前提是我们再也没有新的想法了。对吧？它的前提是我们没有剩下的事情可做。我们今天生活中所做的一切，是的，就是终点。是的。如果别人能为我完成那一项任务，那么我就只剩下一项任务了。我现在必须坐着等待某些事情。是的。你知道，等待退休，坐在摇椅上。这个想法对我来说没有意义。所以，我认为智能不是零和博弈。我周围的聪明人越多，我身边的天才越多，出奇的是，我拥有的想法越多，我设想我们可以解决的问题就越多，我们创造的工作就越多，创造的就业机会就越多。所以我想，我不知道一百万年后留给我的孩子们的世界会是什么样子。但是，在接下来的几十年里，我的感觉是经济将会增长。许多新工作将被创造出来。每一份工作都会改变。一些工作会消失。我们不会再骑马在街上跑了，这些都会好起来的。你知道，人类众所周知地对复利系统持怀疑态度，并且非常不擅长理解，他们更不擅长理解随着规模增长而加速的指数系统。

### 预测未来与搭上“快车”

We've talked about exponentials a lot today. You know, the great futurist Ray Kurzweil said in the 21st century, we're not going to have a hundred years of progress. We're likely to have 20,000 years of progress. Right. Right. You said earlier, we're so fortunate to be living at this moment and contributing to this moment. I'm not going to ask you to look out 10 or 20 or 30 years because I think it's so challenging. But when we think about 2030 things like robots, 30 years is easier than 2030. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, I'll get I I'll grant you license to go out 30. as you think out over the course of I like these shorter time frames because they have to marry bits and atoms bits and Adams the hard part of building this stuff right because everybody's saying it's going to happen is interesting but not helpful exactly but if we have 20,000 years of progress reflect on that statement by Ray reflect on exponentials and how all of our listeners whether you work in government whether you're in a startup whether you're you know running a big company need to be thinking about the accelerating rate of change, the accelerating rate of growth and how you will, you know, be co-intelligent in this new world.

我们今天谈了很多指数级增长。你知道，伟大的未来学家雷·库兹韦尔说，在21世纪，我们不会有100年的进步，我们可能会有2万年的进步。对。对。你早些时候说过，我们很幸运生活在这一刻并为这一刻做出了贡献。我不会要求你展望10年、20年或30年，因为我认为这太具有挑战性了。但当我们想到2030年，像机器人这样的事情……30年比2030年更容易。哦，真的吗？是的。是的。好的。所以，我给你30年的时间跨度。我喜欢这些较短的时间框架，因为它们必须将“比特”与“原子”结合起来。构建这些东西的难点在于，每个人都说它会发生，但“有趣但没有帮助”是完全正确的。但如果我们有2万年的进步，请思考雷·库兹韦尔的这句话，思考指数级增长，以及我们所有的听众，无论你是在政府工作，还是在初创公司，还是经营着大公司，都需要思考变化的加速率、增长的加速率，以及你将如何在新的世界中保持“共同智能”。

Well, there there are a lot of things that that that many people have already said and and um and they're all they're all very sensible. I think the the um uh in the next 5 years, one of the things that that is really cool that's going to get solved is the fusion of artificial intelligence and megatronics, robotics. And so we're going to have we're going to have, you know, AIS that are that are going to be wandering around us. And uh we all and that everybody knows uh we all all know that we're going to all grow up with our own R2-D2. Yeah. And that R2-D2 remember everything about us and coach us along the way and be our companion. We already know that. Okay. and and so the idea and and and the idea that every human will have their own GPUs associated with them in the cloud um and that they're 8 billion people 8 billion GPUs that's a you know viable outcome. Yeah. you know, and so and each having their own model that's fine-tuned for them, fine-tuned for them. And they that that AI is in the cloud is also embodied in a whole bunch of it's embodied in your car. It's embodied in your own robot. It's everywhere with you. And so that I think that that future is a very sensible thing. the idea that uh we're we're going to understand the the infinite complexity of biology and understanding the system of biology uh and how it how how to predict it and have digital twins of every everybody um our own digital twin for health care like we have a digital twin for shopping at Amazon why wouldn't we have our digital twin at health care of course we would and so uh you know a dig a system that that predicts how our how we're going to age what disease will likely going to have and uh anything that's that's about to happen maybe even next week or you know tomorrow afternoon and predict it early. Of course, we're going to have all that. And so I think all of that is a given. Um I think the the the the the part that that I'm asked a lot by uh CEOs that I work with about now given all of that, what happens? What do you do? And this is this is the this is a common sense of of things that move fast, right? If you if you have a if you have a train that's about to get faster and faster and go exponential, the only thing that you really need to do is get on it. Yeah. And once you get on it, you'll figure everything else out along the way. Right. And so to predict where that train's going to be, right, and try to shoot a bullet at it. Yeah. or predict where that train's going to be and it's going exponentially faster every second and go figure out what intersection to wait for it, right? That's impossible. Just get on it while it's going kind of slowly, right? And go exponential along the way. A lot of people think this just happened overnight. You know, you've been you've been at this for 35 years. I remember hearing Larry Pageige say probably around 2005 or 2006 that the end state of Google will be when the machine can predict uh the question before you even answer it before you even ask it and give you the answer without having to look right. I heard Bill Gates say in 2016 because contextually you must be asking about you must be wondering about that. I heard Bill Gates say in 2016 when somebody said hasn't all the things been done we've had the internet we've had cloud we've had mobile social etc. He said, "We haven't even started." He said, "What do you think? Why would you say that?" He said, "We won't even begin until machines go from being dumb calculators to beginning to think for themselves, to think with us, right?" Um, kind of that is the moment, right, that we're in. I think to have leaders like you, leaders like Sam and Elon, Satcha, etc., it's such an extraordinary advantage for this country, right? and to have the cooperation that we see between a system of risk capital that I take, you know, that I'm part of which can provide the risk capital for people to do. We don't we're not relying on government having a Manhattan project. We can actually do this ourselves and together for the benefit of the country. It's an extraordinary time and at a scale that's unimaginable.

有很多事情人们已经说过了，而且它们都是非常合理的。我认为在接下来的五年里，一件非常酷的事情将被解决，那就是人工智能和机械电子学、机器人技术的融合。所以我们将拥有……我们将拥有在我们身边游荡的AI。我们所有人都知道，我们将伴随着我们自己的R2-D2一起成长。是的。那个R2-D2会记住我们的一切，一路指导我们，成为我们的伴侣。我们已经知道了。好的。所以，每个人的云端都有与他们相关的GPU，而且有80亿人，80亿个GPU，这是一个可行的结果。是的。你知道，所以……每个人的模型都根据他们自己进行了微调。那个AI在云端，它也体现在……它体现在你的车里，体现在你自己的机器人里。它无处不在。我认为那个未来是一个非常合理的景象。我们将来会理解生物学的无限复杂性，理解生物学的系统，以及如何预测它，拥有每个人的数字分身……我们为医疗保健拥有的数字分身，就像我们为在亚马逊购物拥有的数字分身一样，我们当然会为医疗保健拥有数字分身。所以，一个可以预测我们如何衰老、可能患上什么疾病，以及任何可能在下周或明天下午发生的事情的系统，并能及早预测出来。当然，我们都会拥有这一切。所以，我认为这一切都是理所当然的。我想我经常被我合作的CEO们问到的问题是，鉴于所有这一切，接下来会发生什么？你该怎么做？这是一个关于快速发展的事情的常识，对吧？如果你有一列火车，它将变得越来越快，呈指数级发展，你真正需要做的就是登上它。是的。一旦你登上了它，你就会在路上弄清楚其他一切。对吧？所以，去预测那列火车将在哪里，然后试图瞄准它，对吧？或者预测火车将在哪里，它每秒都在指数级加速，然后去弄清楚应该在哪个交叉路口等着它，对吧？这是不可能的。趁它还在慢慢行驶时就赶紧上去，对吧？然后在路上呈指数级增长。很多人认为这一切是突然发生的。你知道，你已经在这个领域工作了35年。我记得拉里·佩奇在2005年或2006年左右说过，谷歌的最终状态将是机器能够在你回答问题之前预测出问题，甚至在你提问之前就给出答案。我在2016年听比尔·盖茨说过，因为你一定是在问关于……你一定在想那个。我在2016年听比尔·盖茨说过，当有人问“所有事情难道没有做完吗？我们有了互联网，有了云，有了移动社交等等”，他说：“我们甚至还没有开始。”他说：“你觉得呢？你为什么这么说？”他说：“直到机器从笨重的计算器开始转变为能为自己思考，能与我们一起思考，对吧？”这正是我们现在所处的时刻。我认为有你这样的人，萨姆、埃隆、萨蒂亚等领导人，这对这个国家来说是一个非凡的优势，对吧？而且我们看到了风险资本体系——我参与其中，可以为人们的行动提供风险资本——与政府之间的合作。我们不依赖政府有一个曼哈顿计划。我们可以自己一起为国家利益做这件事。这是一个非凡的时代，其规模是难以想象的。

### 拥抱变化与社会包容性

It's an extraordinary time. But I also think, you know, one of the things that I'm just grateful is that we have leaders who also understand their responsibility to the fact that we are creating change at an accelerating rate. And we know while it will most likely be great for the vast majority, there'll be challenges along the way. And we'll deal with those as they come and raise the floor for everybody and make sure that this is an a win, not just for some elite bureaucrats at the top hanging out in Silicon Valley. And don't scare them. Bring them along. Don't scare them. Bring them along. And we will. Yeah. So, thank you for that. Exactly.

这是一个非凡的时代。但我也认为，我很高兴的是，我们有领导者也认识到，我们正在以加速的速度创造变革，他们有责任去应对。我们知道，虽然这很可能对绝大多数人来说是件好事，但过程中也会出现挑战。我们会应对这些挑战，提高所有人的底线，确保这是一场胜利，而不仅仅是为那些在硅谷闲逛的精英官僚们的胜利。不要吓跑他们。把他们带进来。不要吓跑他们。把他们带进来。我们会的。是的。所以，谢谢你。的确如此。
