### 政治言论的界限：职场与课堂的挑战

你可能听过“死者为大”这句话，它是一种道德指引，但它能否也成为一条职场规则呢？上个月，在美国播客**查理·柯克**（Charlie Kirk: 一位右翼评论员）去世后，安大略省苏圣玛丽市的一位市议员在社交媒体上表示，他散布了仇恨言论。她目前正受到该市**廉政专员**（Integrity Commissioner: 负责调查政府官员行为不当指控的独立官员）的调查。大约在同一时间，多伦多大学的一位教授因发帖称这次枪击事件“对法西斯分子来说太好了”而被停职。这引发了一些重大问题：如果你在工作中或网上发表了有争议的言论，你的雇主究竟能做什么？言论自由的限制是什么？学校又该如何？在课堂上讨论敏感话题可能很棘手，是否有任何话题应该被禁止？

<p class="english-text">YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THE PHRASE DON'T SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD. IT'S KIND OF A MORAL GUIDANCE. CAN IT ALSO BE A WORKPLACE RULE? AFTER AMERICAN PODCASTER CHARLIE KIRK WAS KILLED LAST MONTH, A COUNCILLOR IN SAULT STE. MARIE SUGGESTED ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE SPREAD HATE SPEECH. SHE IS NOW BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE CITY'S INTEGRITY COMMISSIONER. AROUND THE SAME TIME, THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PUT A PROFESSOR ON LEAVE AFTER SHE POSTED THAT THE SHOOTING WAS, QUOTE, TOO GOOD FOR FASCISTS. IT RAISES SOME BIG QUESTIONS WHAT CAN YOUR EMPLOYER ACTUALLY DO IF YOU SAY SOMETHING CONTROVERSIAL AT WORK OR ONLINE? WHAT ARE THE LIMITS ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION? AND WHAT ABOUT SCHOOLS? TALKING ABOUT CHARGED TOPICS IN THE CLASSROOM CAN BE TRICKY. SHOULD ANYTHING BE OFF LIMITS.</p>

欢迎收看《**综述**》（The Rundown: 本期节目的名称）。教师和学生如何处理敏感问题的讨论？政治偏见在学校里是个问题吗？我邀请了**安大略省中学教师联合会**（Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, OSSTF: 安大略省中学教师的工会组织）约克地区主席**穆娜·卡德里**（Muna Kadri）和应届高中毕业生**萨拉·莫拉**（Sara Mora）分享他们在学校谈论政治的经历。

### 教师视角：课程与外部压力

好的，我们今天在这里讨论如何在课堂上驾驭政治言论。我想从教师的角度了解，教师们是否觉得在课堂上可以讨论的内容受到了限制？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALL RIGHT. SO WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF NAVIGATING POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE CLASSROOM. I WANT TO KNOW FROM A TEACHER'S PERSPECTIVE, DO TEACHERS FEEL A CHILL ON WHAT THEY CAN DISCUSS IN A CLASSROOM?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：我们讨论的内容是由**课程**（Curriculum: 教学大纲和内容）指导的。所以教育部会告诉我们在课堂上讨论什么，但这取决于当时的氛围。举个例子，在新冠疫情期间，出现了一些**两极分化议题**（Polarizing issues: 导致意见严重分歧的争议性话题）。课程指导我们教学的内容，但我们知道当社区出现外部问题时，会存在一些压力。因此，由于这些压力，驾驭某些问题变得困难。但我们仍然必须教授课程，这也是我们正在做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WELL, WHAT WE DISCUSS IS GUIDED BY CURRICULUM. SO THE MINISTRY TELLS US WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING IN THE CLASSROOM, BUT DEPENDING ON THE CLIMATE. SO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. DURING COVID, THERE WAS SOME POLARIZING ISSUES. THE CURRICULUM GUIDES WHAT WE TEACH, BUT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PRESSURES WHEN THERE'S EXTERNAL ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE SOME ISSUES BECAUSE OF THOSE PRESSURES. BUT AGAIN, WE STILL HAVE TO TEACH THE CURRICULUM AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO.</p>
</details>

### 学生视角：批判性思维与偏见

在高中时期，那些不一定属于课程内容，或者说与课程相关的话题讨论是怎样的？你是如何驾驭这些对话并在课堂上谈论它们的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL AROUND SORT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT WEREN'T NECESSARILY CURRICULUM MAYBE CURRICULUM ADJACENT, PERHAPS. BUT HOW DID YOU SORT OF NAVIGATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND HOW WOULD YOU TALK ABOUT THEM IN THE CLASSROOM?</p>
</details>

**萨拉·莫拉**：这是一个很好的问题。我认为你们两位都提出了很好的观点。每个时期都特别容易引起争议，政治上总会有一些事情发生，一些冲突或危机。教育本身就具有固有的政治性。即使是你如何与学生沟通等方面的决策，也具有固有的政治性。我认为我比一些同学更具**政治倾向**（Politically oriented: 对政治问题更感兴趣或更关注）。所以，在我高中上历史、地理或经济学等课程时，这确实是我关注的重点。我非常感谢我的老师们非常乐意促进这类对话。例如，去年美国大选期间，我担任历史社社长，我们组织了一次课后课程，讲解美国政治如何运作，美国大选如何进行，以及这次选举的预期。我的历史老师实际上是这次课程的负责人，他非常乐意进行这些对话。我认为所有这些对话中最重要的是，你认识到你无法将自己与偏见分开。但同样，学习如何批判性思考，这绝对是我的所有老师都做得非常出色的一点，他们会指出，你知道，努力将偏见与我们赋予这些事物的价值分开，在一个非常主观的环境中，给我们提供最客观的立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION. AND I THINK THAT, LIKE, BOTH OF YOU GUYS MADE REALLY GOOD POINTS. LIKE, EVERY, EVERY TIME IS LIKE A PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS TIME. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOMETHING GOING ON POLITICALLY AND SOME CONFLICT OR CRISIS. AND I MEAN, LIKE EDUCATION ITSELF IS INHERENTLY POLITICAL. SO EVEN MAKING DECISIONS WITHIN HOW YOU COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR STUDENTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT IS INHERENTLY POLITICAL. I THINK THAT I AM A MORE PARTICULARLY POLITICALLY ORIENTED PERSON THAN SOME OF MY CLASSMATES. SO THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I FOCUSED ON IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I WAS IN CLASSES LIKE HISTORY OR GEOGRAPHY OR ECONOMICS, THAT WAS DEFINITELY AT THE FOREFRONT OF MY MIND. I THINK I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE HAD TEACHERS WHO WERE VERY OPEN TO FOSTERING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS DURING THE US ELECTION, FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR, I WAS LIKE HEAD OF THE HISTORY CLUB, SO WE ORGANIZED A KIND OF LESSON AFTER SCHOOL ABOUT HOW US POLITICS WORKS, HOW THE ELECTION WORKS IN THE US, AND WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THIS ELECTION. AND MY HISTORY TEACHER ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE WHO LED IT, AND HE WAS VERY OPEN TO THESE CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK THAT WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT ABOUT ALL OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS IS THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT YOU CAN'T SEPARATE YOURSELF FROM BIAS. BUT AGAIN, LIKE LEARNING HOW TO THINK CRITICALLY, THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT ALL OF MY TEACHERS DID A REALLY GREAT JOB AT POINTING OUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE TRYING TO SEPARATE THE BIAS FROM THE VALUE THAT WE ASCRIBE TO THESE THINGS AND, AND JUST GIVING US THE MOST OBJECTIVE STANCE IN A VERY SUBJECTIVE LANDSCAPE.</p>
</details>

穆娜，我想了解一下，是否有老师因为在课堂上的政治言论而受到纪律处分？**OSSTF**（Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation: 安大略省中学教师联合会）是如何提供帮助的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MUNA I WANT TO UNDERSTAND, HAVE THERE BEEN TEACHERS WHO HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED FOR, YOU KNOW, POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE CLASSROOM, AND HOW HAS THE OSSTF HELPED?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：我无法就安大略省的纪律处分及其定义发表评论，但确实与教师们进行过关于课堂上被视为政治言论的担忧的对话。我认为你提出了一个很好的观点，那就是一切皆政治。因此，就我们作为OSSTF的角色而言，我们支持教师们如何在某个话题具有挑战性时驾驭课程，并且从支持约克地区的3500名成员来看，他们都在努力做到正确，帮助学生做出自己的决定，帮助学生评估资源，帮助学生驾驭困难的对话。因此，就像你说的，在不同时期针对不同问题会有一种寒蝉效应，我们作为一个联合会的角色是帮助我们的同事以最佳方式支持学生来完成课程，你可以在我旁边看到一个成果，她正在做着令人难以置信的工作，部分原因就是她在公共教育环境中接受的教育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL OF ONTARIO IN TERMS OF DISCIPLINE AND OUR DEFINITIONS OF DISCIPLINE, BUT HAVE THERE BEEN CONVERSATIONS WITH TEACHERS ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS DEEMED POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE CLASSROOM? AND SO I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT, IS EVERYTHING IS POLITICAL. AND SO IN TERMS OF OUR ROLE AS OSSTF, WE SUPPORT TEACHERS IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE CURRICULUM DURING TIMES WHERE A TOPIC MIGHT BE CHALLENGING AND AND TO TELL YOU FROM SUPPORTING 3500 MEMBERS IN YORK REGION, THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT IN TERMS OF HELPING STUDENTS MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS, HELPING STUDENTS ASSESS RESOURCES, HELPING STUDENTS NAVIGATE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS. AND SO WHILE, LIKE YOU SAID, THERE'S A CHILL AT DIFFERENT TIMES OVER DIFFERENT ISSUES, OUR ROLE AS A FEDERATION IS TO HELP OUR COLLEAGUES WORK THROUGH THE CURRICULUM IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS STUDENTS IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE, AND YOU CAN SEE A PRODUCT OF THAT SITTING BESIDE ME WHO'S DOING INCREDIBLE WORK, PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE EDUCATION THAT SHE RECEIVED IN A PUBLIC EDUCATION SETTING.</p>
</details>

在支持方面，你从一些成员那里听到了哪些求助？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORTS, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CALLS THAT YOU WERE HEARING FROM SOME OF THE MEMBERS?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：我给你举个例子。安大略省社会科学课程的很大一部分都谈到了讨论时事。所以我们会接到电话说，我们如何讨论A、B和C作为时事。所以我们总是回到这个问题：它是否在你的课程中？好的，是的，它在你的课程中。然后我们讨论你是否引入了各种资源？你是否引入了学生的生活经验？你是否试图培养学生能够引入自己的资源并批判性评估这些资源的方式？我们希望帮助学生成为能够融入世界并以对社会具有建设性和生产力的方式进行政治讨论的成年人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SO I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. MUCH OF THE ONTARIO CURRICULUM IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES TALKS ABOUT TALKING ABOUT CURRENT EVENTS. SO WE'LL GET A CALL SAYING HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT A, B AND C AS A CURRENT EVENT. AND SO WE ALWAYS COME BACK TO IS IT IN YOUR CURRICULUM OKAY. YES, IT'S IN YOUR CURRICULUM. THEN WE TALK ABOUT ARE YOU BRINGING IN A VARIETY OF RESOURCES. ARE YOU BRINGING IN STUDENTS LIVED EXPERIENCES? ARE YOU TRYING TO FOSTER WAYS SO THAT STUDENTS CAN BRING THEIR OWN RESOURCES IN AND CRITICALLY ASSESS THOSE RESOURCES? WE WANT TO HELP STUDENTS BECOME ADULTS WHO CAN INTEGRATE IN A WORLD AND HAVE POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS IN A WAY THAT'S CONSTRUCTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE FOR SOCIETY.</p>

### 科技影响：手机录像与“寒蝉效应”

我想更好地了解。我上高中时，手机还不普及。它们虽然存在，但课堂上通常不允许使用。人们不会录制视频。现在你可以看到课堂上以前从未发生过的事情。我很好奇，在你上学的时候，学生们是否会录制老师的视频并发布到社交媒体上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I WANT TO HAVE A BETTER. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, CELL PHONES WEREN'T REALLY AROUND. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE AROUND, BUT THEY WEREN'T REALLY ALLOWED IN THE CLASSROOM. PEOPLE WEREN'T RECORDING VIDEOS. YOU CAN SEE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE CLASSROOM THAT YOU WOULD NEVER SEE BEFORE. AND I AM CURIOUS, DO DO STUDENTS EVER RECORD TEACHERS AT THE TIME THAT YOU WERE IN SCHOOL AND POST VIDEOS ON SOCIAL MEDIA?</p>
</details>

**萨拉·莫拉**：好的，就我个人而言，我从未见过那样的事情。我理解那可能是一个担忧，尤其是在进行政治敏感对话或与学生进行一些更脆弱的交流时。你明白我的意思吗？我从未见过我的任何同伴或同学做那样的事情。当然，我们有时会和老师合影，或者有时会互相分享一些东西，但我从未见过有人故意去损害别人的形象。我并不是说这种情况不会发生。当然，我的视角是基于我的高中经历和我一起长大的那些人，但根据我的经验，我没有见过那样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">OKAY, SO I PERSONALLY I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE I, I UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT BE A CONCERN, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A POLITICALLY CHARGED CONVERSATION OR SOMETHING THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE VULNERABLE WITH YOUR STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY OF MY PEERS OR CLASSMATES DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OF COURSE, LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE WE'LL TAKE PHOTOS WITH OUR TEACHERS OR SOMETIMES LIKE, SHARE THINGS AMONGST EACH OTHER, BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE TRY AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO HARM SOMEONE'S IMAGE LIKE THAT. NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. OF COURSE, I HAVE A VERY MYOPIC LENS BASED ON MY HIGH SCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND THE PEOPLE THAT I GREW UP WITH, BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE, I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：穆娜，请不要那样做，这是我的第一个想法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">MUNA PLEASE DON'T WOULD BE MY FIRST THOUGHT.</p>
</details>

（笑声）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[LAUGHTER]</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：我的第二个想法是，我们在学期开始时非常努力地创建我们所谓的“课堂规范”，以便学生们在课堂上能够安全地进行良好的对话，而想到有人可能会录下学生们正在尝试的想法和观点。作为一名保护我课堂上学生的老师，这让我感到恐惧，因为他们可能会有这样的想法。不幸的是，我们的系统资金不足，我一个班有30或40个孩子，我们正在努力进行对话，而你却在混乱的瞬间捕捉到片段，这对我在课堂上要保护的学生来说是如此的没有成效和有害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">MY SECOND THOUGHT IS, IS WE WORK REALLY HARD TO CREATE WHAT WE CALL CLASSROOM NORMS AT THE BEGINNING OF A SEMESTER SO THAT STUDENTS FEEL SAFE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE REALLY GOOD CONVERSATIONS IN CLASSROOM, AND TO THINK THAT SOMEBODY COULD VIDEOTAPE A STUDENT'S ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH THOUGHTS AND IDEAS. AS A TEACHER WHO'S PROTECTIVE OF THE STUDENTS IN MY CLASSROOM, IT TERRIFIES ME THAT THAT'S A THOUGHT THEY COULD HAVE. AND WE HAVE, UNFORTUNATELY, AN UNDERFUNDED SYSTEM WHERE I HAVE 30 OR 40 KIDS IN A CLASS AND WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND YOU CATCH A SNIPPET IN A MOMENT OF CHAOS THAT'S SO UNPRODUCTIVE AND HARMFUL TO THE STUDENTS I'M MEANT TO PROTECT IN MY CLASSROOM.</p>
</details>

这是否对老师们产生了寒蝉效应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">DOES THAT PUT A CHILL ON WHAT TEACHER?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：绝对会。作为一名教师，我的首要职责是保护我课堂上的学生，而做这种违反——我猜想是违反了每一项董事会政策，我知道在我所在的董事会，它确实违反了董事会政策——的行为，真的会让学生们觉得他们在学习时无法进行脆弱的对话，因为他们担心有人会录像。所以我很高兴看到我们正在对手机采取更强硬的立场，以确保这类事情不会在课堂上发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. AND MY PRIMARY ROLE AS A TEACHER IS TO PROTECT THE STUDENTS IN MY CLASSROOM AND DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WHICH VIOLATES I'M GOING TO GUESS EVERY SINGLE BOARD POLICY I KNOW IN MY BOARD IT VIOLATES BOARD POLICY REALLY PUTS STUDENTS IN A PLACE WHERE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY CAN HAVE VULNERABLE CONVERSATIONS AS THEY'RE LEARNING, BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED SOMEONE'S GOING TO FILM. SO I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE'RE TAKING A STRONGER TONE ON CELL PHONES TO MAKE SURE THINGS LIKE THAT AREN'T HAPPENING IN CLASSROOMS.</p>
</details>

在这种情况下，谁会受损？在这种无法进行对话的特定例子中，技术会造成什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WHO LOSES OUT IN THAT? IN WHAT SORT OF TECHNOLOGY CAN CREATE IN THAT PARTICULAR EXAMPLE WHERE YOU CAN'T HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：学生们。你知道，我前几天读到一位记者发的一条推文，他发了一条关于某事的细致入微的推文。然后他受到了恶毒的攻击，没有细致入微的对话。我心想，我们正在失去进行政治论述的能力，因为我们找不到可以安全练习它的地方。如果我们说，好吧，你不能在学校里谈论这个，那么你将在哪里学习如何进行有细微差别和分歧的尊重性对话呢？如果不是在课堂这个安全的环境中呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">STUDENTS. AND, YOU KNOW, I READ A TWEET FROM A REPORTER THE OTHER DAY ABOUT HE PUT OUT A TWEET AND IT WAS NUANCED ABOUT SOMETHING. AND THEN THERE WAS VITRIOL THAT CAME AT HIM, NO NUANCED CONVERSATION. AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, WE'RE LOSING THE ABILITY TO HAVE POLITICAL DISCOURSE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FINDING PLACES WHERE WE CAN PRACTICE IT IN A SAFE WAY. IF WE SAY, WELL, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS IN SCHOOL, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LEARN TO HAVE A RESPECTFUL CONVERSATION WITH NUANCE AND DISAGREEMENT. IF IT'S NOT IN THE SAFE ENVIRONMENT OF A CLASSROOM?</p>
</details>

是的，这一点很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> YEAH, PICK.</p>
</details>

**萨拉·莫拉**：这是一个很好的观点。我认为学校，以及整个教育体系，是你成长以及开始作为社会一员思考和运作的基础。你知道，即使是一个刚上大学的学生，我现在读大一，人们谈论**象牙塔**（Ivory Tower: 指脱离现实、专注于学术研究的机构或环境），以及它如何是一个非常像真空、非常封闭的空间。我认为这可能是一件好事。我认为高中也是一个很好的地方，学生们可以在那里促进对话，他们可以自由开放地分享他们的意见，并在那个环境中感到安全。它是一种公共领域，你可以在那里分享任何你想分享的东西，并进行富有成效的讨论，不受任何社会、经济因素的限制，这些因素可能会在未来作为成年人限制你表达真相并为自己和自己的观点辩护。我认为这是培养批判性思维能力、评估周围正在发生的时事能力的好方法。它就是进行这些对话的地方，所以它们受到威胁，它们正在受到某种程度的寒蝉效应，这没有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UP ON THAT IS SUCH A GOOD POINT. I THINK THAT SCHOOLS LIKE AND JUST EDUCATION AS A WHOLE IS LIKE THE FOUNDATION FOR HOW YOU GROW UP AND HOW YOU BEGIN TO THINK AND FUNCTION AS A MEMBER OF OUR SOCIETY. AND, YOU KNOW, EVEN AT A FRESH UNIVERSITY STUDENT. SO I'M IN MY FIRST YEAR AND PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE IVORY TOWER AND HOW IT'S A VERY LIKE IT'S A VACUUM, IT'S A SECLUDED SPACE. AND I THINK THAT THAT CAN BE A GREAT THING. AND I THINK THAT'S HIGH SCHOOL IS ALSO A GREAT PLACE FOR STUDENTS TO FACILITATE CONVERSATION, WHERE THEY CAN SHARE THEIR OPINIONS FREELY AND OPENLY AND AND BE SAFE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A KIND OF PUBLIC SPHERE WHERE YOU ARE ABLE TO SHARE WHATEVER YOU WANT AND HAVE PRODUCTIVE DISCOURSE, NOT LIMITED TO WHATEVER, LIKE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT MIGHT CONFINE YOU IN THE FUTURE AS AN ADULT TO SPEAK YOUR TRUTH AND ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR OWN VIEWS. AND I THINK THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO FOSTER CRITICAL THINKING ABILITIES, THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT EVENTS GOING ON AROUND YOU. IT'S JUST IT IS THE PLACE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS, SO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT THEY'RE UNDER THREAT AND THAT THEY ARE BEING, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A CHILL, LIKE IN SOME WAYS.</p>

### 教育部备忘录：模糊的指导方针

我想读一份备忘录。这是前教育部长**吉尔·邓洛普**（Jill Dunlop）去年在10月7日袭击事件一周年之际发给全省各学区的，我将部分内容读出来：“我们学校的重点必须始终是学习。这意味着我们的学校和与学校相关的活动绝不能被用作政治抗议的工具，以煽动、歧视和仇恨内容。虽然每个人都有权拥有自己的政治观点，但他们无权将政治偏见散布到我们的课堂中。”我们确实联系了教育部征求意见，但在录制前没有收到回复。但你如何解读教育部的这份备忘录？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I WANT TO READ A MEMO. THIS WAS SENT OUT BY THE FORMER EDUCATION MINISTER, JILL DUNLOP, LAST YEAR TO SCHOOL BOARDS ACROSS THE PROVINCE AROUND THE TIME OF THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE OCTOBER 7TH ATTACK, WHICH I WILL READ IN PART, THE FOCUS IN OUR SCHOOLS MUST ALWAYS BE ON LEARNING. THIS MEANS OUR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL RELATED ACTIVITIES SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS VEHICLES FOR POLITICAL PROTESTS THAT ENABLE INFLAMMATORY, DISCRIMINATORY AND HATEFUL CONTENT. WHILE EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO THEIR OWN POLITICAL OPINIONS, THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO DISSEMINATE TO POLITICAL BIASES INTO OUR CLASSROOMS. WE DID REACH OUT TO THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION FOR COMMENT, BUT WE DID NOT HEAR BACK IN TIME FOR THIS TAPING. BUT HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THIS MEMO FROM THE MINISTRY?</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：有时不清楚。所以我理解他们正在努力促进一个安全的学习环境，这是每个教育工作者都致力于的。我们的目标是尽可能地保护学生的安全。但如果能有更清晰的说明，我们会很感激，因为我给你举个例子。我是一名政治老师。我们必须教授的很多内容都是政治性的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">WELL, UNCLEAR AT TIMES. AND SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, WHICH EVERY EDUCATOR IS COMMITTED TO LIKE.

MUCH OF WHAT WE HAVE TO TEACH IS POLITICAL.</p>
</details>

还有偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> AND BIASES.</p>
</details>

**穆娜·卡德里**：没错。我们必须谈论一些非常困难的话题和历史上发生的一些可怕的事情。那么这份备忘录是否指示我们不要教授课程呢？我希望不是。我希望部长不会抛弃课程。这只是缺乏清晰度的问题。对于如此重要的事情，我认为部长有机会，你知道，邀请专家、教师和教育工作者参与进来。让我们深入探讨学校里正在发生的事情，并找到在课程范围内工作的方法，以确保学生的需求得到满足，并且没有人感到在课堂上不安全，因为这才是目标，对吗？安全和学习齐头并进，并且相信老师，我们把学生的需求放在第一位。如果教育部长相信我们，我认为他们会对这个系统有更多的信心，他们也应该有。作为教育部长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">EXACTLY. AND WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF SOME VERY DIFFICULT TOPICS AND SOME TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED HISTORICALLY. AND SO DOES THAT MEMO DIRECT US NOT TO TEACH CURRICULUM? I'm HOPING NOT. I WOULDN'T I WOULD HOPE THAT THE MINISTER ISN'T SORT OF SORT OF THROWING AWAY CURRICULUM. IT'S JUST A LACK OF CLARITY IS AN ISSUE. AND FOR SOMETHING THAT'S SO IMPORTANT, I THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MINISTER, YOU KNOW, BRING EXPERTS TO THE TABLE, BRING TEACHERS AND EDUCATION WORKERS TO THE TABLE. LET'S UNPACK WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SCHOOLS AND FINDING WAYS WHERE WE CAN WORK WITHIN THE CURRICULUM TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE HAVING THEIR NEEDS MET IN A WAY THAT NOBODY FEELS UNSAFE IN THE CLASSROOM, BECAUSE THAT'S THE GOAL, RIGHT? YOU KNOW, SAFETY AND LEARNING HAND IN HAND AND TRUST TEACHERS LIKE WE PUT STUDENT NEEDS FIRST. IF THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION WOULD TRUST US, I THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM, WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE. AS THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION.</p>
</details>

你已经稍微提到了这一点。根据你的经验，你似乎有很多很棒的老师。我们都有自己的偏见。关键在于我们如何处理它。我们身兼多职。作为记者，作为老师，你是否曾觉得老师们有偏见？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">YOU'VE TOUCHED ON THIS A LITTLE BIT. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A NUMBER OF GREAT TEACHERS. WE ALL HAVE OUR BIASES. IT'S HOW WE APPROACH IT. WE ARE WEARING MANY HATS. AS A JOURNALIST, AS A TEACHER, DID YOU EVER FEEL LIKE TEACHERS HAD A BIAS?</p>
</details>

**萨拉·莫拉**：我认为很多人都非常担心政治叙事和偏见在课堂上的传播，尤其是在谈论学校里的政治言论时。我只是觉得，认为你可以拥有一个没有偏见的课堂有点无意义。我认为每个人天生都有偏见。如果你认为某件事有价值且值得谈论，那就是你对该主题的偏见。你赋予它价值，因此你对它有偏见。所以我确实认为，当然，我的所有老师都有偏见。我也有偏见，每个人都有自己的偏见，但我认为这取决于你如何处理。如果你让你的学生意识到，你正在与之交谈的人意识到，你所说的内容不一定是客观的，也不是普遍的，或者，你知道，双方都可以做出某些判断。我认为这在任何对话中都非常重要，甚至不仅仅是政治言论方面，例如，我在高中上了很多历史课，这一点对我们来说非常强调，尤其是在我们阅读不同作者、不同来源等内容时。所以我确实认为，当然，老师会有政治偏见。他们会有自己的个人经历影响他们的观点。但我也认为，如果处理得当，这些对话可以非常有成效，他们仍然可以与学生进行对话，而不必将自己的叙事或观点强加给他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I THINK THAT IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT THE DISSEMINATION OF POLITICAL NARRATIVES AND BIASES IN CLASSROOMS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO TALKING ABOUT POLITICAL SPEECH IN SCHOOLS.

IF YOU DECIDE THAT SOMETHING IS VALUABLE AND WORTH TALKING ABOUT, THAT IS YOUR BIAS TOWARD THAT SUBJECT. YOU'RE ASCRIBING IT VALUE AND THEREFORE YOU ARE BIASED TOWARDS IT. SO I DO THINK, OF COURSE, ALL MY TEACHERS HAD BIAS. I'M A I AM BIASED, EVERYONE HAS THEIR BIASES, BUT I THINK IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU APPROACH THAT. AND IF YOU MAKE YOUR STUDENTS AWARE THAT PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO, AWARE THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS NOT NECESSARILY OBJECTIVE AND THAT IT'S NOT UNIVERSAL, OR, YOU KNOW, THERE IS THERE ARE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE ON EITHER SIDE. I THINK THAT THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ANY CONVERSATION, NOT EVEN JUST IN TERMS OF POLITICAL SPEECH, BUT FOR EXAMPLE, I TOOK A LOT OF HISTORY CLASSES IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS STRESSED SO MUCH TO US, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE READING FROM DIFFERENT AUTHORS, DIFFERENT SOURCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I DO THINK THAT OF COURSE, TEACHERS WOULD HAVE POLITICAL BIAS. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THAT INFLUENCE THEIR OPINIONS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IF IF HANDLED WELL, THOSE CONVERSATIONS CAN BE EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE AND THEY CAN STILL NAVIGATE CONVERSATIONS WITH STUDENTS WITHOUT NECESSARILY IMPOSING THEIR OWN NARRATIVE OR OPINIONS ON THEM.</p>

**穆娜·卡德里**：继续做你们正在做的事情，因为你们做得非常好。当我和一位从我们公共教育系统毕业的学生坐在一起时，她正在各方面都表现出色，这证明了安大略省6万名OSSTF成员所做的令人难以置信的工作，所以请继续以关怀和善良的态度对待公共教育，并继续成为那些将学生放在首位的优秀课程专家。所以我的信息与其说是给我们省的老师们，我知道他们把学生放在第一位，不如说是给教育部长，要对一个为我们的学生运作得如此良好的系统建立信心，并给予适当的资金支持，这样你就可以在课堂上进行这些对话，而班上没有40个其他学生。你能想象一场辩论吗？你曾经历过40名学生讨论一些非常非常困难的事情，或者学校有适当的更小的班级规模。请信任你的教育工作者，并在家庭中建立信心。我送我的孩子上学是因为我热爱我们的公共教育系统。所以我的信息不是给我的同事，而是给教育部长。

AND WHEN I SIT BESIDE A STUDENT WHO GRADUATED FROM OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, WHO'S ABSOLUTELY ROCKING IT IN EVERY WAY SHE IS, IT'S A TESTAMENT TO THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THE 60,000 OSSTF MEMBERS IN ONTARIO DO, AND SO KEEP APPROACHING PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM A PLACE OF CARING AND KINDNESS, AND KEEP BEING THOSE INCREDIBLE CURRICULUM EXPERTS WHO PUT STUDENTS FIRST. AND SO MY MESSAGE ISN'T SO MUCH TO THE TEACHERS IN OUR PROVINCE WHO I KNOW ARE PUTTING STUDENTS FIRST. IT'S TO THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION IS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN A SYSTEM THAT'S WORKING SO WELL FOR OUR STUDENTS, AND TO FUND IT APPROPRIATELY, SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS IN YOUR CLASSROOM WITHOUT 40 OTHER STUDENTS IN THE CLASS. CAN YOU IMAGINE A DEBATE? YOU EXPERIENCED IT WITH 40 STUDENTS DISCUSSING SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT, OR SCHOOLS APPROPRIATELY SMALLER CLASS SIZES. TRUST YOUR EDUCATORS AND BUILD CONFIDENCE AMONG FAMILIES. I SEND MY CHILD TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I LOVE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO MESSAGE NOT TO MY COLLEAGUES IS THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION.</p>

### 大学环境：更自由的政治讨论

好的，萨拉，你来回答最后一个问题。正如我们提到的，你现在是一名大学生，你明确表示你在高中时没有感到被压制或类似的情况。但你现在上大学后，在言论方面是否感到更自由了？

<details>

<p class="english-text">ALL RIGHT, SARAH, YOU GET THE LAST QUESTION. YOU'RE A UNIVERSITY NOW, AS WE MENTIONED, AND YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT YOU WERE YOU DIDN'T FEEL LIKE YOU, YOU KNOW, WERE SILENCED OR ANYTHING IN HIGH SCHOOL. BUT DO YOU FEEL FREER NOW THAT YOU'RE IN UNIVERSITY? IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN SAY?</p>
</details>

**萨拉·莫拉**：我认为在大学里，你身处一个更集中的群体，这些人对你所上的任何课程都非常感兴趣。所以我正在上四门伦理课。我们每天都在辩论。

<p class="english-text">I THINK THAT JUST BEING IN UNIVERSITY, YOU ARE IN A MUCH MORE CONCENTRATED GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN WHATEVER CLASS YOU'RE IN. SO I'M TAKING LIKE FOUR ETHICS CLASSES. WE ARE DEBATING EVERY SINGLE DAY.</p>

**萨拉·莫拉**：这正是那些在高中和类似学校里被视为禁忌的对话，以及教育部或福特政府不希望你谈论的事情。我刚从高中毕业，我正在看到所有这些事情，比如可能罢免学区委员，以及试图决定学生或老师在学校里可以谈论什么和不能谈论什么。这让我非常担忧，因为我在教育方面有很好的经历。我不想看到学生或老师在这方面失去他们的自主权以及他们言论的自由。但就大学而言，我确实认为我被许多志同道合的同伴包围着，他们对政治感兴趣，对辩论这些事情感兴趣。所以我确实认为，如果你将自由定义为人们更愿意谈论什么，因为那是他们感兴趣的，那么是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AND IT IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THAT ARE TABOO IN IN SCHOOLS, IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THINGS LIKE THAT, AND THINGS THAT THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION OR THE FORD GOVERNMENT THAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO TALK ABOUT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND I, I'M WATCHING AS I JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND I'M SEEING ALL OF THESE THINGS, LIKE THE POTENTIAL REMOVAL OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES AND, AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT STUDENTS OR TEACHERS CAN AND CANNOT TALK ABOUT IN SCHOOLS. AND THAT'S REALLY CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE I DID HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF MY EDUCATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE STUDENTS OR TEACHERS LOSE THEIR AUTONOMY IN THAT, IN THAT SENSE AND WHAT THEY CAN TALK ABOUT IN THEIR FREEDOM. BUT YEAH, IN TERMS OF UNIVERSITY, I DO THINK THAT I'M I'M SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF LIKE MINDED PEERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN POLITICS, PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN DEBATING THESE THINGS. SO I DO THINK THAT IF YOU CONSTITUTE FREEDOM AS WHAT PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN, THEN YES.</p>
</details>

好的，我们就到此为止。萨拉，我非常感谢你的时间。我想我们都同意，我们前途光明。未来已经得到了照顾。我们很好。

### 职场政治言论：法律保护与雇主责任

在美国，许多雇主几乎可以出于任何原因解雇员工。但在加拿大并非如此。但这并不意味着你不会因为在办公室或互联网上发表的言论而面临后果。**半岛加拿大**（Peninsula Canada: 一家提供就业法律和人力资源咨询服务的公司）的就业法律和人力资源高级顾问**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**（Charlie Herrera Vacaflor）对此进行了解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IN THE US, MANY EMPLOYERS CAN FIRE PEOPLE FOR ALMOST ANY REASON. THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN CANADA. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T FACE CONSEQUENCES FOR WHAT YOU SAY IN THE OFFICE OR ON THE INTERNET. CHARLIE HERRERA VACAFLOR, AN EMPLOYMENT LAW AND HR SENIOR CONSULTANT AT PENINSULA CANADA, EXPLAINS.</p>
</details>

查理，欢迎来到节目。我们来谈谈职场中的政治言论。与种族、性别或宗教相比，它受到怎样的保护？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CHARLIE, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. LET'S TALK POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE WORKPLACE. HOW IS IT PROTECTED COMPARED TO RACE, GENDER OR RELIGION?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：这是一个很好的问题，也是我们**半岛**（Peninsula: 指Peninsula Canada公司）经常向客户澄清的问题。政治言论并非在所有加拿大**司法管辖区**（Jurisdiction: 拥有法律管辖权的区域或机构）都受到特别保护。例如，联邦人权立法和安大略省的立法并未特别保护政治言论，但许多其他省份则有。那么这意味着什么呢？我能否明确且公然地禁止职场中的政治言论？不能。作为雇主，你可以做的是设定具体的指导方针，说明什么是职场中尊重的政治言论，以及在哪些情况下可能被视为不尊重的言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND SOMETHING THAT WE CONSTANTLY CLARIFY TO OUR CLIENTS AT PENINSULA, POLITICAL SPEECH IS NOT SPECIFICALLY PROTECTED IN ALL CANADIAN JURISDICTIONS. FOR INSTANCE, THE FEDERAL HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AND ONTARIO'S DO NOT PROTECT SPECIFICALLY POLITICAL SPEECH, HOWEVER MANY OTHER PROVINCES DO. NOW, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? CAN I SPECIFICALLY AND BLATANTLY BAN POLITICAL SPEECH FROM THE WORKPLACE? NO. WHAT AS AN EMPLOYER YOU CAN DO IS SET SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OF WHAT IS RESPECTFUL POLITICAL SPEECH IN THE WORKPLACE AND WHICH INSTANCES WILL BE CONSIDERED. POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT IS NOT RESPECTFUL.</p>
</details>

我认为我们最近看到很多人因为言论而面临后果，我们看到他们被解雇或开除。雇主可以基于什么理由解雇某人因政治言论？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I THINK WHAT WE SEE OF LATE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEING THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE SAID, AND WHAT WE SEE IS THEM BEING TERMINATED FROM THEIR JOB OR FIRED. ON WHAT GROUNDS COULD AN EMPLOYER TERMINATE SOMEONE FOR POLITICAL SPEECH?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：所以在**半岛**（Peninsula: 指Peninsula Canada公司），我们告诉客户的是，没有哪种解雇是零风险的，因此这类决定应该经过深思熟虑。正如我所提到的，政治言论在某些司法管辖区是受保护的，作为一项受**人权立法**（Human Rights Legislation: 旨在保护个人免受歧视的法律）保护的特征，因此，根据具体情况，解雇可能会导致**歧视索赔**（Discrimination claim: 指控某人因受保护特征而受到不公平待遇的法律诉讼）。因此，重要的是我们始终建立具体的指导方针，说明什么是可接受的政治言论，什么对其他员工是尊重的，以及如何进行这类对话，以便每个人都能在了解和理解预期行为的情况下行事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SO AT PENINSULA, WHAT WE SAY TO OUR CLIENTS IS THAT NO TERMINATION IS RISK FREE, AND THEREFORE THESE KIND OF DECISIONS SHOULD BE WELL THOUGHT. AS I MENTIONED, POLITICAL SPEECH IS PROTECTED. AND IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, AS A HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTED CHARACTERISTIC AND THEREFORE, DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES, A TERMINATION COULD LEAD TO A DISCRIMINATION CLAIM. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ALWAYS ESTABLISH SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OF WHAT IS ACCEPTED POLITICAL SPEECH, WHAT IS RESPECTFUL TO OTHER EMPLOYEES IN HOW TO HAVE THESE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS SO THAT EVERYONE OPERATES WITH KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS THE EXPECTED CONDUCT.</p>
</details>

### 居家办公、社交媒体与公司声誉

我想谈谈，你知道，很多人居家办公，还有技术的影响。很多人在朝九晚五的工作结束后，晚上5点以后过自己的生活。我想区分一下，或者说，在家、在线社交媒体上谈论一些可能有争议的事情，与在办公室里谈论这些事情，两者之间是否有区别？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SORT OF, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WORK FROM HOME, BUT ALSO THE THE SORT OF THE INFLUENCE OF TECHNOLOGY, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE AFTER IF THEY'RE WORKING A 9 TO 5 AFTER 5:00, THEY'RE THEY'RE LIVING THEIR LIVES. AND I WANT TO MAKE A DISTINCTION. OR IS THERE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOMEONE WHO IS, YOU KNOW, USING SOCIAL MEDIA, TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE CONTROVERSIAL AT HOME, ONLINE VERSUS IN THE OFFICE?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：是的，这是一个很好的问题。你知道，鉴于围绕某些政治人物、言论发生的一切，最近这个问题经常出现。所以有两种方法。第一种方法是，正如我之前提到的，制定一项工作场所政策，告诉员工在工作场所的最佳行为规范。第二种方法是始终与员工保持透明和持续的沟通，说明如何处理具体情况。所以今年对加拿大人来说是艰难的一年，因为我们经历了多次选举。我们正在走出或正在经历与我们最亲密的邻居关系动荡的时期。而且，你知道，人们有……他们想说些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">YEAH, THAT'S THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AND, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT HAS COME UP A LOT LATELY, GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AROUND CERTAIN POLITICAL FIGURES, EXPRESSIONS AND, YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S TWO APPROACHES. THE FIRST APPROACH IS HAVING, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, A WORKPLACE POLICY THAT TELLS EMPLOYEES WHAT IS THE BEST PRACTICE CONDUCT FOR THEIR WORKPLACE. THE SECOND ONE IS ALWAYS TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT AND CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES ABOUT WHAT, WHAT, HOW TO GO OVER SPECIFIC SITUATIONS. SO IN THIS YEAR, IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN A HARD YEAR FOR CANADIANS BECAUSE WE HAD PLENTY OF ELECTIONS. WE ARE COMING OUT OR WE'RE GOING THROUGH, YOU KNOW, TURMOIL OF A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR CLOSEST NEIGHBOR. AND, YOU KNOW, FOLKS HAVE THE YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.</p>
</details>

有很多话要说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> HAVE A LOT TO SAY.</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：是的，没错。我是说，我们是人，你知道，所以在这方面，雇主总是要强调，在你想要发表言论之前，确保如果你真的必须说，如果你真的必须说，并且如果你真的必须说，确保有某些注意事项或某些保护措施到位。你的社交媒体，你的社交媒体是否带有你的公司 affiliation？你的名字是否在那里？你知道，这些事情。然后当然，让我们尽量缓和我们表达自己的方式，你知道。仇恨言论，你知道，不仅会给自己带来问题，而且，你知道，如果你的公司 affiliation 与之相关联，可能会给公司带来声誉问题。这就是工作场所政策最能解决这类情况的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">YEAH, EXACTLY. I MEAN, WE'RE PEOPLE WE'RE, YOU KNOW, AND AND SO IN THAT REGARD, IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO FOR EMPLOYERS TO SAY BEFORE YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING, MAKE SURE IF IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO, IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO, AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN CAVEATS OR THERE ARE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE, IS YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA, DOES YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA HAVE YOUR COMPANY AFFILIATION? IS YOUR LIKE A SPECIFIC NAME THERE? YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS. AND THEN OF COURSE, LET'S TRY TO MODERATE THE WAY THAT WE EXPRESS OURSELVES, YOU KNOW. HATEFUL SPEECH, YOU KNOW, CAN ALWAYS BRING PROBLEMS NOT ONLY FOR ONESELF BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE HAVING YOUR COMPANY AFFILIATION ATTACHED TO THAT, IT COULD BRING REPUTATIONAL PROBLEMS FOR THE COMPANY. AND THAT IS WHERE A WORKPLACE POLICY BEST ADDRESSES THOSE KIND OF INSTANCES.</p>

### 真实案例：查理·柯克事件与同理心

好的。我想谈谈一些真实的例子。我们请市场研究公司**高级符号学公司**（Advanced Symbolics Inc.: 一家市场研究公司）使用名为**Poly**（Poly: Advanced Symbolics Inc.开发的人工智能技术）的人工智能技术，找出人们在工作场所害怕谈论的话题。排名第一的话题是**查理·柯克**（Charlie Kirk: 一位右翼评论员），不是你，而是查理·柯克，对于不了解他的人来说，他是一位上个月在犹他州校园被杀的右翼评论员。他们发现，任何围绕查理·柯克的对话都会迅速升级为激烈的争论或指责，而且有一种明显的感觉，任何评论都可能被持相反意见的同事误解或武器化。就这个具体的例子而言，人们是否需要害怕他们对他所说的话？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES. WE ASKED THE MARKET RESEARCH FIRM ADVANCED SYMBOLICS INC. WHICH USES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY KNOWN AS POLY, TO FIND OUT WHAT TOPICS PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT IN THE WORKPLACE. AND THE NUMBER ONE TOPIC CAME UP AS CHARLIE KIRK, NOT CHARLIE YOU, BUT CHARLIE KIRK, WHICH FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW A RIGHT WING COMMENTATOR WHO WAS KILLED IN UTAH ON CAMPUS LAST MONTH, AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT ANY CONVERSATION AROUND CHARLIE KIRK QUICKLY ESCALATED INTO HEATED ARGUMENTS OR ACCUSATIONS, AND THERE WAS A PALPABLE SENSE THAT ANY COMMENT COULD BE MISREPRESENTED OR WEAPONIZED BY COLLEAGUES WITH OPPOSING VIEWS. WITH THIS SPECIFIC EXAMPLE, DO PEOPLE NEED TO BE AFRAID OF WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT HIM?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：你知道，这种说法本身是非常危险的，当人们对自己的想法和表达感到恐惧时，似乎有很多事情在此之前就已经出了问题。现在我们正在努力找出如何解决这些问题。我之前在谈到我们所做的出版物时说过，员工和雇主都正在经历很多变化，这些变化的速度是前所未有的。立法正在出台，新的事情正在发生。你知道，紧张局势正在加剧，然后人们只是做出反应。在这种反应中，你知道，问题、紧张局势随之而来，恐惧也随之而来，无论是对员工还是对雇主。在这种情况下，我承认存在很多紧张和不确定性，关于如何管理这些情况。但我认为关键是同理心。我的表达将如何被对方接收？如果另一个人说了一些我完全不同意的话，我应该如何，我将如何接收？我认为这是所有雇主都应该传达的关键信息之一，那就是，你知道，在表达自己的方式上要有更多的同理心，因为，无论你可能伤害了别人，你也可能受到伤害。而且，如果我们不这样做，问题是情况会升级。而且，你知道，愿我们永远不要在工作场所发生暴力。我们告诉所有雇主、所有客户的关键事情之一是，他们有义务提供一个相互尊重的工作环境，这是一项实际的法律义务。因此，如果雇主不能保证，员工就可以有很好的资源来对抗他们的企业。这也解释了为什么雇主也感到非常紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">YOU KNOW, THAT STATEMENT IN ITSELF IS IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN PEOPLE LIVE WITH FEAR ABOUT WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE AND THEIR EXPRESSIONS, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG BEFORE. NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. WHAT I'VE SAID BEFORE, IN PART ABOUT THE PUBLICATIONS THAT WE DO, IS THAT BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS HAVE ARE GOING THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES, AND THE VELOCITY OF THESE CHANGES IS UNPRECEDENTED. PACE LEGISLATION IS BEING COMING UP, NEW THINGS ARE HAPPENING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S TENSION GROWING AND THEN PEOPLE JUST REACT. AND IN THIS REACTION IS WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEMS, THE TENSION COMES AND THE FEAR ENSUES, BOTH FOR THE EMPLOYEE AND THE EMPLOYER. IN THESE SITUATIONS, I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, TENSION AND JUST UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW TO MANAGE THESE SITUATIONS. BUT I THINK THE KEY ONE IS EMPATHY. HOW HOW IS MY EXPRESSION GOING TO BE RECEIVED BY THE OTHER PERSON? AND IF ANOTHER PERSON WERE TO SAY SOMETHING THAT I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH, HOW SHOULD I HOW WILL I RECEIVE THAT? AND I THINK THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE KEY MESSAGES THAT ALL EMPLOYERS SHOULD BE PUTTING OUT THERE IS, YOU KNOW, HAVE MORE EMPATHY IN THE WAY THAT YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF, BECAUSE, HOWEVER, YOU MAY BE HURTING OTHER PEOPLE, YOU MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO THAT. AND WHEN, WHEN IF WE DON'T DO THAT, THE PROBLEM IS THAT SITUATIONS WILL ESCALATE. AND, YOU KNOW, MAY THAT NEVER HAPPEN, THAT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE VIOLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WE TELL ALL OUR EMPLOYERS, OUR CLIENTS, IS THAT THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO HAVE A RESPECTFUL WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT IS AN ACTUAL LEGAL OBLIGATION. AND SO IF EMPLOYERS CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT EMPLOYEES CAN HAVE A GOOD RESOURCE TO GO AGAINST THEIR BUSINESSES. SO THIS ALSO CLARIFIES WHY EMPLOYERS ARE ALSO FEEL VERY TENSE.</p>
</details>

### 员工权利与模糊的界限

我想从员工的角度更好地了解。我们谈论“猎巫行动”，我们谈论雇主必须发表声明的压力。如果一名员工因发布关于查理·柯克或以色列和巴勒斯坦的冒犯性言论而被解雇，该员工有什么追索权来挑战他们的解雇？有时看起来雇主行动迅速，因为他们必须做出回应，我们正处在一个如果你看不到回应或有人被解雇，就意味着没有采取任何行动的时代。但从员工方面来说，他们能做些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING FROM THE EMPLOYEE SIDE OF THINGS. WE TALK ABOUT SORT OF THE WITCH HUNT. WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESSURE THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO PUT OUT A STATEMENT. IF AN EMPLOYEE IS FIRED FOR POSTING SOMETHING OFFENSIVE ABOUT CHARLIE KIRK OR ISRAEL AND PALESTINE, WHAT RECOURSE DOES THE EMPLOYEE HAVE TO CHALLENGE THEIR TERMINATION? SOMETIMES IT MAY SEEM THAT EMPLOYERS ARE BEING QUICK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RESPOND IN A WE'RE IN A TIME AND AGE WHERE IF YOU DON'T SEE A RESPONSE OR SOMEONE HAS BEEN FIRED FROM THEIR JOB, THEN SOMETHING IS NOT BEING DONE. BUT ON THE EMPLOYEE SIDE, IS THERE SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：我们在**半岛**（Peninsula: 指Peninsula Canada公司）非常谨慎，总是告诉我们的雇主，你的员工有权利。你的员工有你需要尊重的保障。言论自由就是其中之一。在某些司法管辖区，正如我之前提到的，政治言论受到特别保护。这意味着通过解雇或不合理的纪律处分可能会让你面临人权索赔。我们告诉客户与员工沟通的是，如何在允许他们拥有自由的情况下管理这种情况，同时也要让他们意识到他们的言论和表达方式可能会受到审查。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">WE'RE VERY CAREFUL AT PENINSULA TO ALWAYS TELL OUR EMPLOYERS, YOUR EMPLOYEE HAS RIGHTS. YOUR EMPLOYEE HAS GUARANTEES THAT YOU NEED TO RESPECT. FREEDOM OF SPEECH IS SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THEM. AND IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, POLITICAL SPEECH IS SPECIFICALLY PROTECTED. SO THAT MEANS THAT OPERATING THROUGH TERMINATION OR UNREASONABLE DISCIPLINARY ACTION CAN WARRANT YOU A HUMAN RIGHTS CLAIM. WHAT WE DO TELL OUR OUR CLIENTS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES IS HOW TO MANAGE THIS IN A SITUATION THAT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE THE FREEDOM, BUT ALSO MAKES THEM AWARE THAT THEIR SPEECH AND THE WAY THAT THEY VOICE IT, CAN BE PUT UNDER SCRUTINY.</p>
</details>

很明显，界限是模糊的。是的，我们正在谈论的是，有时政治言论和可能被视为仇恨言论的内容非常清楚，但在多大程度上，言论取决于旁观者的看法？我想给你举个例子。你知道“从河流到大海，巴勒斯坦将获得自由”这句话可能对某些人来说是冒犯性的，但对另一些人来说则不是。雇主如何驾驭这种细微差别？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THERE ARE BLURRED LINES. YEAH. THIS IS WE'RE TALKING THIS IS A SOMETIMES IT'S VERY CLEAR AS TO WHAT IS POLITICAL SPEECH AND WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED HATEFUL, BUT TO WHAT EXTENT IS SPEECH IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER? I WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW THE PHRASE FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE TO SOME PEOPLE, BUT NOT TO OTHERS. HOW DO EMPLOYERS NAVIGATE THE NUANCE OF THAT?</p>
</details>

**查理·埃雷拉·瓦卡弗洛**：所以每个人都有权对特定的紧张局势持有特定的看法，对吧？当我们谈论战争时，总会有灰色地带。具体的方法是确保整个工作场所能够向前发展，无论言论如何，无论说了什么。因为对某些人来说可能是冒犯性的，对另一些人来说则可能不是，反之亦然。所以这里的问题是，我们如何才能以一种方式共同前进，你知道，人们不分裂，人们不制造暴力，人们不制造紧张。我总是说，当我们谈论LGBTQ+社区时，最明确的方式是，像代词这样的东西对那个社区来说意味着一切，因为它不仅谈论他们的身份，还谈论他们表达自己的方式。而对此发表评论对许多人来说可能只是顺带一提，但对那个社区来说，它意味着一切。而不尊重这一点，实际上是否定了他们的存在。所以“从河流到大海”的表达可能对某些人来说是完全正当和值得捍卫的，但对另一些人来说，它也与他们的存在有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SO EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO A SPECIFIC VIEW ON A SPECIFIC TENSION, RIGHT. AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WAR, THAT WILL ALWAYS HAVE GRAY AREAS, THE SPECIFIC WAY IS TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKPLACE AS A WHOLE IS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD, NO MATTER HOW IT'S BEING SAID, NO MATTER WHAT IS BEING SAID. BECAUSE WHAT CAN BE OFFENSIVE TO SOMEBODY MAY NOT BE OFFENSIVE TO OTHERS AND VICE VERSA. SO THE ISSUE HERE IS HOW CAN WE MOVE TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DON'T SEPARATE, PEOPLE DON'T CREATE VIOLENCE, PEOPLE DON'T CREATE TENSION. I ALWAYS SAY THAT WITH THE MOST CLEAR CUT WAYS WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY, SOMETHING LIKE A PRONOUN MEANS EVERYTHING FOR THAT COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT'S TALKING ABOUT NOT ONLY THEIR IDENTITY, BUT THE WAY THAT THEY EXPRESS THEMSELVES. AND HAVING A COMMENT ABOUT THAT MAY BE LIKE SOMETHING IN PASSING FOR MANY FOLKS, BUT FOR THAT COMMUNITY, IT'S EVERYTHING. AND NOT BEING RESPECTFUL ABOUT THAT. IT'S LITERALLY NEGATING THEIR EXISTENCE. SO EXPRESSIONS FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA MAY MEAN, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING TOTALLY RIGHTFUL AND CHAMPION FOR SOME, BUT FOR THE OTHER ONES HAS TO DO WITH THEIR EXISTENCE AS WELL.</p>
</details>

查理，我们就到此为止。非常感谢。这为员工和雇主提供了一些很好的思考。
