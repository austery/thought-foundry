title: 投资中的心理安全：如何通过高质量对话和从失败中学习做出明智决策
summary: 在2024年投资大会上，Amy Edmondson教授深入探讨了心理安全对投资者成功的重要性。她强调，高质量的投资决策本质上是“押注”，需要团队成员敢于提出异议、分享不适的真相。文章详细阐述了心理安全脆弱性、风险-回报计算的非对称性，以及如何通过区分基本、复杂和智能错误来促进组织学习。最终，Edmondson教授建议，与其直接谈论心理安全，不如专注于如何进行高质量对话，并培养一种理性应对失望、着眼于未来学习的心态。

### 心理安全：投资者成功的基石

主持人：现在我能听到你了。很好，这里非常安全，所以没问题。这次会议很棒，我喜欢开场和视频。我们也一样，这里有很棒的人，但有时他们也会感到疲惫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I can quite hear you. You can hear me now. Now I can, yeah, all right, but here it's super safe, so no problem. Was great, I loved it, I love the opening, I loved the video, yeah, same here. We have fantastic people here and uh, yeah, it takes a toll on them once in a while, you know, yeah.</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：那么，**心理安全**（Psychological Safety: 指团队成员感到可以自由表达想法、提出问题、承认错误，而不用担心被惩罚或羞辱的氛围）对投资者为何如此重要？它具体表现为何？我认为投资者需要心理安全，因为你们的成功取决于做出高质量“押注”的能力。你们可能不喜欢“押注”这个词，或许更喜欢“决策”或“投资”，但毫无疑问，它们都是押注，因为其中存在不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um, psychological safety, why do we need it as investors and what does it look like? Well, I think you need psychological safety as investors because your success depends on your ability to make high quality bets. Now you might not like the word bets, you might prefer decisions or Investments, but make no mistake, they bets, right? There there's uncertainty in in in in that way.</p>
</details>

这些“押注”绝对依赖于高质量的对话，而高质量的对话又依赖于心理安全。它们要求人们积极参与，说出那些令人不适的真相，提出想法、担忧或异议。对话应包含提问和回答，并朝着一个不确定的解决方案深思熟虑地推进，但这个解决方案的质量要高到足以让人觉得可以继续前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and those are absolutely dependent on high quality conversations and high quality conversations are dependent on psychological safety. They require that people lean in and say the uncomfortable truths when they they raise an idea, they raise a concern, they raise a dissenting View and the conversation includes sort of questions and answers and and and makes thoughtful progress toward an uncertain resolution, but one that people feel is is high enough quality to go forward, right?</p>
</details>

那么，心理安全看起来像什么？它看起来像一种允许坦诚的许可感。它并不意味着舒适。事实上，它可能看起来有点不舒服，因为带着那些你并非完全确定正确或有用的想法积极参与，这并不自然和正常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what does it look like? It looks like a sense of permission for cander. It does not look comfortable, you know, in fact, it it probably looks a little uncomfortable because it's not natural and normal to sort of to lean in with the thoughts you have that you're not absolutely sure are right or helpful, yeah.</p>
</details>

### 当心理安全变得脆弱时：领导者的挑战

主持人：那么，一个显而易见的问题是，当它变得不安全时，有时会变得不安全，但当它长期处于不安全状态时，我们该怎么办？对听众有什么建议吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so the obvious question is also when it becomes kind of um unsafe, it it becomes unsafe once in a while anytime, but when it becomes like chronically unsafe, what what do we do any advice to the audience?</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：是的，当它长期不安全时，最终的结果是隐形的，我认为认识到这种不对称性非常重要。因为当人们发言时你能听到，但当他们有所保留时你却听不到。你根本不知道他们脑子里其实有些想法没有分享出来。所以，从某种意义上说，作为领导者，你必须假设这种情况可能正在发生，并且它可能会让你和工作的质量面临风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ah, yeah, I mean, because when it becomes chronically unsafe, what what you end up with, which by the way, is invisible and I think that's really important, you know, to recognize the the asymmetry, um, here, because you can hear when people speak up, you cannot hear when they hold back. You just don't know that there actually is something in their heads that they're not sharing.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为起点就是——这可能听起来老套或多余——不断提醒人们你们所做工作的性质，即你们的工作必然包含不确定性。它必然受益于多元的视角或背景，那些对情况有不同看法的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so in a sense as a leader, you have to assume that it may be happening and that that it may put you at risk and and the quality of the work at risk. So I think what the the place to start is just and it may seem, you know, old or redundant, but keep reminding people of the nature of the work you're doing, that the work you're doing necessarily includes uncertainty, right? It necessarily benefits from diverse perspectives or backgrounds that you know, that that have a different angle on the situation, um, and so it's it's um.</p>
</details>

为什么这很重要？因为当你提醒人们不确定性和风险时，你是在为为什么你确实关心他们的声音设定一种理性的基础。所以，你实际上是专注于我们为什么需要它，即驱动因素，而不是过多地谈论心理安全本身，那可能会适得其反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I and why why does that matter? Because when you are reminding people of the uncertainty and what's at stake, you're setting a kind of intellectual rationale for why it actually makes sense that you do care about their voice. So it's so you actually focus on the on the why we need it, so the the drivers, not so talking too much about psychological safety might have backfire a bit.</p>
</details>

不，不，事实上，如果可以的话，我甚至会建议根本不要谈论它，只谈论高质量的对话应该是什么样子。它如何让人们真正冒险分享他们的想法，并愿意在不发言时专注倾听？这样我们才能共同朝着我们能做出的最佳决策前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, no, in fact, some ways if if I had my brothers, I'd recommend don't talk about it at all. It just talk about what does a high quality conversation look like, how Does it include people, you know, really taking those risks to share their thoughts and being willing to listen intently in the moments when they're not speaking, right? So that together we are making progress toward the best possible decision we can make.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，所以这种心理安全会有些波动。但从你的角度来看，它到底有多脆弱？也许这个问题有点过于笼统了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so so this psychological safety goes a bit up and down, so it fluctuates a bit, so but how vulnerable is it really from your perspective, maybe that's a bit too Global question, yeah.</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：是的，这就是问题所在，它实际上相当脆弱。我认为人们需要内化两种不对称性，无论是理智上还是情感上。其中之一就是我所说的**风险-回报计算**（Risk-Reward Calculus: 一种衡量在特定行动中潜在收益与潜在损失之间权衡的思维模式）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, this is the this is sort of the problem is that it's it's actually quite vulnerable, um, and I I think there's two asymmetries, uh, that that that people need to internalize, uh, and sort of intellectually and maybe emotionally as well. And one is what I call the risk reward calculus, right?</p>
</details>

想象一下，你可能并非完全有意识地权衡是否要就某事发表意见，分享一个想法或观点。在那一刻，如果你发言，谁会受益？团队，或者说组织。你有多大信心你的声音会带来收益？信心不大。而且，这种收益何时会发生？未来某个时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's the if I mean, imagine a moment where you are weighing maybe not entirely consciously, but you're you're you're weighing whether or not to speak up about something to share a thought, a view and in that moment, if you were to speak, who gains? Well, the team, you know, the the the um, the organization, if you will, how confident are you that your voice will produce a gain? Not very. And when will that gain occur? Well, sometime down the road.</p>
</details>

现在，如果你因为不确定而保持沉默，谁会受益？你会受益。你会在接下来的几分钟里保持安全和舒适。这种收益何时发生？立即。你有多大信心你的沉默不会导致糟糕的结果？百分之百。所以，当你仔细思考时，这是一种相当深刻的不对称性。你会意识到领导者实际上必须去“寻宝”，否则这种风险-回报计算会让你屡屡受挫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you because you're not quite sure, stay silent, who gains? You do, right? You stay you stay safe and comfortable for another minute. When does that gain happen? Immediately. How confident are you that your silence won't produce a bad outcome? 100%. So that's a pretty profound asymmetry, you know, when you think about it, you realize that leaders actually have to go on a treasure hunt because otherwise the risk reward calculus will get you every time.</p>
</details>

我认为另一个不对称性是好与坏交流之间的不对称。所以，如果我因为冒险发言而得到糟糕的回应——也许这种情况很少发生，但如果有人对我置之不理、评头论足，甚至直接羞辱我，我会在很长一段时间内不再尝试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and I think the other um, the other is the asymmetry between um, the the good and bad exchanges, right? So if I have U you know, and maybe it happens rarely, but if I have a bad a bad reaction to my taking a risk and speaking up and someone is dismissive or judgmental or you know, even um, you know, downright humiliates me, I will not try again for quite some time.</p>
</details>

然而，如果我得到积极的回应，这并不会阻止我再次尝试，但它也不一定会让事情变得容易多少，只是不会让它变得更难。所以，同样，如果我经历了一个羞辱的时刻，我再次尝试的意愿会大大降低。鉴于这些不对称性，你必须——我想我只是在全心全意地回答你的问题——你确实很脆弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whereas if I have a good response, it won't sort of preclude me from trying again, but it doesn't necessarily make it that much easier. It just doesn't make it harder, right? So again, the degree to which I'm willing to try again goes vastly down if I have, you know, one humiliating moment. And so given you know, given those those sort of asymmetries, you have to um, you have to sort of I guess I guess I'm just answering your question wholeheartedly, which is you are vulnerable, yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人：有道理。我想我们都能感同身受。所以，一个误解，或者说我们有时会意识到的情况是，当我们在谈论心理安全时，我们必须稍微打开这个盒子，然后我们谈论它，但人们可能抓不住重点。他们试图让环境变得舒适，但却没有特别的绩效原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Makes sense. I think I think we all can relate to that as well. So so one misunderstanding or uh, or what what we ended up uh, realizing sometimes is that people when we talk a bit about psychological safety, we have to open the box a bit and then we talk about it and then people may be missed the point, so they're trying to make it comfortable, but for no particular reason performance- wise.</p>
</details>

就像你因为创造了安全环境而得分，但却忘记了将其与绩效联系起来。你对这些误解有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like you get points for making it safe, but like you forget to to draw the link between that what's what's your advice for those misunderstandings, yeah.</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：是的，我认为我的建议是，要不断地认识到你们所做的知识密集型、真正需要智力投入的工作的价值。这与发电厂或铝厂等高风险工作不同，但在某些方面你们是共通的，那就是两者都需要一种警惕感，一种与他人之间非常深思熟虑、有意识的互动关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think my my Dev is again to to not again, but to come to come to that um, constant sort of appreciation of the knowledge intensive really intellectual work that you do, um, you know, and that's that's different from say high-risk work in a you know, in a a power plant or an aluminum plant or something like that, but there is some there are some ways in which you have it in common, which is that both require a sense of of of vigilance of very um, thoughtful conscious inter relationships with others.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，我希望仔细倾听你，也希望你仔细倾听我，我们希望人们保持专注。这并不意味着你必须一直完全在线，当然有休息时间，我们希望人们在一天结束时离开，去跑步，或者做任何适合你的事情。但那种意识，即你所做的知识密集型智力工作需要一种警觉性和投入才能做好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm interrelating meaning I want to listen to you closely, I want you to listen to me closely, we want people to be paying attention, um, and doesn't mean you have to be you know, completely on all the time, there are breaks of course, and there are you know, we we want people to you know, leave at the end of the day, go for a run, whatever, you know, whatever works for you, but but that that sense of awareness that the knowledge intends of intellectual work you do requires a kind of um, alertness and an and an engagement to do it well, um, and you know.</p>
</details>

在高风险行业中，让人们表现出色并避免灾难性事故或工人事故的原因，不是对失败的盲点，而是恰恰相反，是对失败的几乎一种执着。他们知道，每个角落都可能发生致命事故，正因为如此，他们会在需要时全力以赴。我只是想说，你也可以在需要时全力以赴，这需要警惕、一点勇气，以及对风险的认识。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What what allows people in high-risk Industries to perform well and to avoid sort of catastrophic accidents or worker uh accidents is not a kind of um, I don't know, a blind spot about failure, but quite the opposite, it's like a almost a preoccupation with failure. They are aware, you know, that around every corner is a potentially fatal accident and because of that, they sort of bring their aame to the moment to the moments that need it and all I'm suggesting is you can bring your aame to the moments that need it and it it's it requires um, vigilance, it requires a little bravery, you know, and it requires just kind of an appreciation for for what's at stake.</p>
</details>

### 从不同类型的失败中学习

主持人：好的，谢谢分享。我们对心理安全这个话题如此着迷，这很有趣。猜猜看，Amy写了这本很棒的书，我刚读完，书名是《The Right Kind of Wrongs》，这是一本关于失败的书，非常有趣。所以，你区分了失败，有时拥有关于失败和做错事的语言，就像更深入地挖掘或拥有更精确的定义。你对**基本错误**、**复杂错误**和**智能错误**之间有一个有趣的区分，你能澄清一下吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, thanks for sharing that isn't it interesting us nerding about you know, on the psychological safety part, so guess what Amy has written this great book, I just finished it, uh, the right kind of wrongs is the name is a book about failures way great fun what fun so so you separate so so I think sometimes having a language around failures and doing things wrong is like uh, digging or have some more Precision to it and you you have an interestes um separation between basic complex and intelligent failures can you clarify a bit, sure.</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：当然，当然。**基本错误**（Basic Failure: 在熟悉领域内因单一人为失误导致的错误）是在熟悉领域中发生的错误，通常是由于人为失误。一个简单的愚蠢错误就可能导致基本错误。例如，2021年，花旗银行（City Bank）的一名员工不小心在一个在线表格中勾错了方框，意外地将9亿美元转账给了一群贷款人。后来，一位法官做出了一个有争议的裁决，不允许花旗银行追回这些资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure, so a basic failure is a failure that occurs in familiar territory usually because of human error, just a single dumb mistake leads to a basic failure. For instance, in 2021, a City Bank employee accidentally checked the wrong box in an online form and accidentally transferred $900 million to a group of lenders, right? And then later a judge uh made a controversial ruling that did not allow City Bank to reclaim those funds, right?</p>
</details>

所以，这是一个单一的人为错误，也许是没有注意，也许是没有经过良好培训，我不知道，但它导致了一个我们都会认为是相当大的错误，尽管它仍然是基本的。所以“基本”并不意味着小或大。当你忘记给手机充电而错过会议时，那是一个基本错误，但有些错误很大，有些很小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it was a single human error, maybe not paying attention, maybe not well trained, I don't know, that led to a failure that we would all consider fairly sizable that was nonetheless basic. So basic doesn't mean small or big, you know, it's a basic failure when you forget to charge your phone and you know Miss a meeting, whatever, but some of them are big, some of them are small.</p>
</details>

**复杂错误**（Complex Failure: 在相对熟悉领域内，由多个小偏差以错误方式组合而成的“完美风暴”式错误）是那些“完美风暴”式的错误。它们是当少数偏离最佳实践的小偏差以错误的方式结合在一起，从而导致失败时，在相对熟悉的领域中不可避免地发生的错误。例如，全球疫情中的供应链中断。同样，复杂错误可以是小或大的，但不同之处在于，这些因素中任何一个单独的小偏差都不会导致失败，是它们结合在一起形成了“完美风暴”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basic complex failures are ones with um the perfect storms. They're the they're the failures that inevitably happen in you know, relatively familiar territory when a handful of small deviations from best practice come together in just the wrong way to create a failure, a supply chain breakdown in a global pandemic, for instance. Again, basic failures can be I mean, complex failures can be small or large, but there the what makes what's different is that any one of those factors on its own, those small deviations wouldn't produce a failure, it it was The Perfect Storm the way they came together.</p>
</details>

无论是基本错误还是复杂错误，都不值得庆祝。它们没有用处。当我们做得最好时，我们可以避免它们。我的意思是，有些会漏掉，我理解，那没关系，我们是人。但当我们做得最好时，我们不需要它们。它们会给我们带来学习，但不会带来很多新的学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Neither basic nor complex failures are worthy of Celebration, right? They're not useful like when we're at our best, we can prevent them. I mean, some of them will slip through, I understand that and that's okay, we're human, but when we're at our best, we don't need to have those they they bring us learning, but not a whole lot of new learning.</p>
</details>

相比之下，我称之为**智能错误**（Intelligent Failure: 在新领域中，经过深思熟虑的实验所产生的非预期结果，旨在获取新知识）的错误，是那些明确发生在新领域中的错误。它们是经过深思熟虑的实验所产生的非预期结果。所以，一个错误要成为智能错误，我们必须还没有获得我们想要的结果所需的知识，所以它是一个新领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In contrast, what I call intelligent failures are those that uh explicitly occur in New Territory. They are the undesired results of thoughtful experiments. So a failure for a failure to be intelligent, um, we must not yet have the knowledge we need to get the result we want, so it's new territory.</p>
</details>

你们的大部分工作按定义都在新领域中。是的，它是在追求一个目标，无论是赚钱，还是掌握一项技能，或者做出科学发现，你都有一个目标。第三，它是假设驱动的。你花时间弄清楚我们知道什么，不知道什么，然后你做了一个好的“押注”。最后，一个错误要成为智能错误，它不应该比获取新知识所需的规模更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Much of your work is in New Territory by definition, yeah, it's in pursuit of a goal, whether that's making money or you know, mastering a a skill or making a scientific discovery, you have a goal. Number three, it is um, hypothesis driven, you've you've you've taken the time to figure out what we know, what we don't know and you've made a good bet. And then finally, for a failure to be intelligent, it should not be any larger than necessary to get the new knowledge, right?</p>
</details>

所以，这就是科学家们每天都在做的事情，但我认为在你们的业务中，你们也在做同样的事情。运动员也在做这个，是的，试图进入新领域，你在拓展，它并不总是奏效。是的，所以，新领域，我们需要承担风险，我们应该庆祝它，因为我们不知道。很难，是的，你必须训练自己说：“好吧，这令人失望，但它仍然有价值。”对吧？它带给我们以前不知道的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is what scient do every day, uh, but I would argue in your business, you are doing this, uh, as well. Athletes also do this, yeah, trying to yeah, trying to get into new territory, uh, you're stretching and it doesn't always work, yeah. So, uh, new territory, we need to take risk and we should celebrate it because we don't know it's hard to yeah, you have to train yourself to say, Okay, that was disappointing and it's still valuable, right? It brings us something we did not know before, yeah.</p>
</details>

### 理性应对失望，着眼未来学习

Amy Edmondson：所有领域，我们都是人，我们今天犯了一些小错误，你知道，事情总会发生。我们应该把它们公开，这样我们就能识别它们，从中学习，也许谁知道呢，下次我们甚至可以预防它们。是的，没错，这很有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all territory, so we we're all human beings, we had some erors small today, you know, things happen, uh, we should uh, get them out in in the open so we can identify them, learn from them and maybe who knows, we might even prevent them next time, but uh, yeah, exactly, so that's useful just uh, before we run out of time here, um, Amy, so um, we see that in this Marathon sport, um, you become world champions of uh, committing mistakes or doing doing something wrong and yeah, so but so you want to focus on the on the wins, right?</p>
</details>

主持人：在马拉松运动中，我们看到你会成为犯错或做错事的世界冠军。所以，你想专注于胜利，对吧？但我可以看到这给很多人带来了负担。有什么建议吗？我想这是我的工作，但有什么建议吗？人们如何轻装上阵，但仍然保持他们的状态，因为我们是长期的，我们希望人们能坚持多年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I can see it takes a toll on quite a few people, any advice this is I suppose this is my job, but uh, any advice, yeah, uh, how can people travel light, but still remain their because we're long term, we want people to last be years.</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：我认为，部分原因在于培养一种更理性的方式来应对失望。我们有一种相当情绪化的自然反应，我们从某种程度上相信，“那不应该发生”，这种想法会让我们筋疲力尽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you know, part of it is having a a more you know, training yourself to have a more rational response to the disappointments. I andan I think we have a natural response that's quite emotional and we believe, you know, at some level, We Believe well that shouldn't have happened and it's it it it it exhausts us in a way to think that way.</p>
</details>

当我们学会掌握“暂停”时，也就是在刺激和反应之间插入那个空间时，我们就能更理性地思考情况：“好吧，这令人失望，我们从中学习到了什么？实际发生了什么？我们如何利用它向前迈进？”这几乎是一种不懈的向前聚焦。我们关心过去，因为过去充满了学习，但我们的焦点在于未来，以及如何利用所有这些宝贵的学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when we learn to master the pause, you know, just insert that space between the stimulus and our response, we can then think more rationally about the situation, okay, that's disappointing and what do we learn from it, what actually happened and how do we use it, uh, to go forward, it's a almost a Relentless forward F Focus, we care about the past because the past is full of learnings, but our our our focus is on on the future and and what do we do with all that valuable learning?</p>
</details>

主持人：这是个好建议。我只是突然想到，Amy，我需要问你，这种心理安全确实引起了共鸣。研究人员、应用实践者、组织都用它来变得更好。你认为社会科学的未来趋势是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's good advice. I just haven't off the burner. I need to ask you Amy, uh, this psychological safety really strike the chord researchers applied PR practitioners organizations have used it to become better where are the herds going in social sciences now, do you think?</p>
</details>

Amy Edmondson：你知道，我真的不知道。在我看来，现在大家都在谈论人工智能（AI）。所以，也许是人工智能的“助推”（AI Nudges），帮助我们掌握暂停，帮助我们变得勇敢，变得更理性。我不知道，但我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I I I I I I don't really know. It seems to me all anyone can talk about is AI, so maybe it's AI nudges that help us Master the pause that help us, you know, sort of be brave, uh, be more rational, I don't know, but um, we'll we'll have to just wait and see.</p>
</details>

主持人：Amy，这太棒了，谢谢你加入我们，再见。
