### 早年经历与印度理工学院的启蒙

我来自印度中部的一个小镇，之后在**印度理工学院孟买分校**（IIT Bombay: Indian Institutes of Technology Bombay）攻读计算机科学。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hail from a small town in the central part of India, and from there, I went on to study computer science at IIT Bombay.</p>
</details>

考入印度理工学院无疑是一个重要的里程碑，不仅对我个人，对我的整个家庭来说都是如此。我记得当我父亲得知我考入印度理工学院时，他大肆庆祝了一番。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Getting into IIT was definitely a big milestone, not just for me but for my entire family. I remember my father celebrated it big time when he learned I got into IITs.</p>
</details>

在印度理工学院孟买分校期间，我一直想创办自己的事业，因为我出身于商业家庭，我的父亲就是一名商人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During my time at IIT Bombay, I always wanted to start something of my own because I come from a business background; my father was a businessman.</p>
</details>

### 创业哲学：垂直化与第一性原理

接下来，我面临着一个问题：在这里我应该做什么？在一个完全陌生、人脉稀少的地方创办一家新公司，实际上是相当令人不安的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The next chapter was about deciding what I should do when I'm here. It's actually pretty uncomfortable to start a new company in a completely new place where you don't have a lot of connections.</p>
</details>

我会给任何创业者的一条建议是实行**垂直化策略**（Go Vertical: 专注于某一特定行业或细分市场）。选择一个你喜欢的行业，如果它是一个**非热门行业**（Unsexy industry: 市场关注度较低但潜力巨大的行业），那就更好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One piece of advice I would give to any entrepreneur is to go vertical. Pick an industry that you like, and it's even better if it's an unsexy industry.</p>
</details>

这是一个艰难的选择，因为我们没有任何行业背景。在一个行业中进行垂直化发展，感觉就像一个困难的选择问题，我们应该如何挑选一个行业呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was a hard choice because we didn't come from any specific industry. Going vertical in an industry felt like a difficult selection problem, like how should we pick an industry?</p>
</details>

回顾过去，凭借事后诸葛亮的视角，我感觉这反倒是一种因祸得福。我们从**第一性原理**（First principles: 从最基本、最核心的假设出发进行思考和解决问题）的角度审视了每一个工作流程和每一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, I feel that it was a blessing in disguise. We looked at every workflow and every problem from a first principles point of view.</p>
</details>

最重要的是选择正确的市场，然后组建正确的团队，最后打造正确的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing is to pick the right market, then pick the right team, and then build the right product.</p>
</details>

### Further AI：专注于保险AI的创新

大家好，我叫Aman，是Further AI的联合创始人兼首席执行官。在Further AI，我们正在为保险行业构建一个AI工作空间，以消除各种工作流程中繁琐的工作。我们现在宣布了新的A轮融资，这是保险AI领域规模最大的A轮融资之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, my name is Aman, and I'm the co-founder and CEO of Further AI. At Further AI, we're building an AI workspace for insurance to eliminate the busy work involved in various workflows. We are now announcing our new Series A funding round, which is one of the largest Series A rounds in insurance AI.</p>
</details>

我们的营收已突破数百万美元。尽管没有任何背景，我们仍然专注于保险业。要垂直化，专注于一个行业，而不是开发通用型软件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have crossed millions in revenue. We just focused on insurance despite not having any background. Go vertical; focus on an industry rather than building a horizontal software.</p>
</details>

### 早期竞争与自我探索

小时候，我一直是班里的尖子生，坐在前排的那种。我的父亲不断提高对我的要求。如果我在一所学校表现出色，他就会把我转到竞争更激烈、有更多聪明人的学校，这样我就必须去竞争。考入印度理工学院通常非常困难，这是一场竞争激烈的考试。我最初面临着与顶尖人才，比如前50或前100名的精英竞争的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a kid, I was always at the top of the class, that guy who sits in the front bench. My father kept raising the bar for me. If I was doing great in one school, he would move me to a school with more competition, with smarter people, so I would have to compete. Getting into IITs is often really hard; it's a very competitive exam. I had this initial pressure of competing with the best brains, like the top 50 or 100 brains.</p>
</details>

我很快意识到，我的优势始终在于我是任何场合中最努力的人。这在印度理工学院孟买分校的前两年对我帮助很大，我取得了优异的成绩。但后来我意识到，也许是时候探索其他事物了。于是我开始更积极地参与体育、文化活动，甚至政治方面的事情。那很有趣，它帮助我更多地了解了自己以及世界的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I quickly realized that my strength has always been that I'm the hardest worker in any room. That really helped me in the first two years at IIT Bombay; I got perfect grades and so on. But then I realized that maybe it was time to explore other things. That's when I became more active in sports, cultural activities, and even politics. That was fun, and it helped me learn more about myself and how the world functions.</p>
</details>

### 微软生涯与首次创业尝试

在大学期间，我在微软实习。在微软我最引以为豪的一件事是建立了一个小型项目团队，启动了**微软社区培训**（Microsoft Community Training: 旨在为蓝领工人提供培训和就业机会的项目），该项目旨在培训和雇佣蓝领工人。我有机会与我的导师和经理一起从零开始构建这个项目。那非常有趣。我还有机会前往南非和世界其他地方推出该产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During my college years, I did an internship at Microsoft. One thing I'm really proud of building at Microsoft was a small project team that started Microsoft Community Training, which was about training and employment of blue-collar workers. I got a chance to build that project from the ground up with my mentor and my manager. That was super fun. I got a chance to travel across the world to South Africa and other parts of the world to launch that product.</p>
</details>

在微软期间，我们曾参与一个关于将求职者与职位匹配的**黑客马拉松**（Hackathon: 编程马拉松，在限定时间内进行软件开发的项目）项目。那是一个有趣的项目，我想我们还凭借那个项目赢得了黑客马拉松。当时我还年轻，所以我觉得这可能是一个能改变世界的想法。有趣的是，当时每个想改变世界的软件工程师都创办了一家**人力资源科技公司**（HR tech company: 利用技术改进人力资源管理和服务的公司）。于是，我也创办了一家人力资源科技公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During my time at Microsoft, we did a hackathon project about matching candidates with jobs. It was a fun project, and I think we even won that hackathon with it. I was young back then, so I felt that maybe this could be the idea that would change the world. It was funny because at that point, every software engineer who wanted to change the world started an HR tech company. So, I started an HR tech company.</p>
</details>

当我离开微软并创立TurboHire时，我着迷于构建一个能够在大规模数据库之上进行搜索的产品。那是我作为创业者的第一次旅程，与我的联合创始人从零开始构建，并将其**年度经常性收入**（ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue）提升到数十亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I moved from Microsoft and started TurboHire, I was fascinated by building something that could allow for search on top of large databases. It was my first journey as an entrepreneur, building something from scratch with my co-founders and taking it to billions of dollars in ARR.</p>
</details>

### 寻求不适：第二次创业与YC的转折

我必须在继续在印度经营公司和我真正爱的人之间做出选择。那是我搬到美国的主要原因。我问我的妻子：“接下来我该做什么？是加入一家大型科技公司，还是加入一家早期创业公司？”她提到：“Aman，你喜欢创造，你有一种不服输的精神，你想建立一家大型上市公司，为什么不尝试一下呢？”那是Further AI成立的最初几个月，当时我不确定是否要创办我的第二家公司，因为我知道创业有多么艰难。关于我的一点，我认为很多创始人都有这种特质，那就是他们寻求不适，因为如果你早早地做困难的事情，生活就会变得更容易。我认为这与我搬到**湾区**（Bay Area: 指旧金山湾区，美国科技创新中心）、在保险业开始创业是一致的，现在我的父亲不再为我设定标准，而是我自己为自己设定标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had to decide between running a company back in India or being with the person I really loved. That was the primary reason for me to move to the US. I asked my wife, 'What should I do next? Should I join a big tech company or an early-stage company?' She mentioned, 'Aman, you like to build, you have a chip on your shoulder, and you want to build a big public company, so why don't you give it a try?' Those were the initial months of Further AI, where I wasn't sure if I would build my second company, knowing what I know about building companies and how hard that journey could be. One thing about me, which I think is true for a lot of founders, is that they seek discomfort because if you do hard things early on, life becomes easier. That's where I think it's consistent with moving to the Bay Area, starting in insurance, and now my father isn't raising the bar for me; I am raising that bar for myself.</p>
</details>

所以现在，每当我感到自己达到了标准，我就会将其提升到下一个更大的目标，就像又一座需要攀登的山峰。我的人生哲学很简单：不断做困难的事情，美好的事情就会发生，你会学到更多，最终当你回顾时，你会觉得你已经走了很长一段路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now, every time I feel I've met the bar, I just raise it to the next big thing, which is yet another hill to climb. My philosophy of life is simple: keep doing hard things, good things will happen, you'll learn more, and in the end, when you look back, you'll feel that you've come a long way.</p>
</details>

在Further AI的早期，我们实际上从一个非常容易着手的问题陈述开始，那是我在第一家公司遇到的问题，即构建用于软件测试的AI代理。我们带着这个想法申请了**Y Combinator**（YC: 知名创业孵化器），并获得了入围等。在YC的早期，Sashank与Michael Seibel交谈时，我们意识到这可能是一个**焦油坑想法**（Tarpit idea: 指一个看起来有吸引力但实际上会耗费大量资源且难以成功的项目或想法）——一个我们团队没有独特能力去实现的想法。正是在YC期间，我们进行了方向调整。我给所有参加YC的创业者的建议是不要在YC期间调整方向，但我们做了。我们当时不知道该做什么。这时，我们的YC合伙人Tom Bloomfield说，我们拥有独特的公司建设和AI结合能力：我的联合创始人Sashank有AI经验，而我之前创办过公司。所以他说：“你们为什么不走垂直化路线呢？选择一个行业并与之合作。”当时这是一个艰难的选择，因为我们没有任何行业背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the early days of Further AI, we actually started with a problem statement that was very comfortable to build: the problem I faced in my first company, which was about building AI agents for software testing. We applied to Y Combinator with that, got shortlisted, and so on. In the early days of YC, Sashank was having a conversation with Michael Seibel, and we realized that this might be a tarpit idea—an idea that we, as a team, were not uniquely capable of building. That's where we pivoted during YC. My advice to every founder doing YC is not to pivot during YC, but we did. We had no idea what to do. That's when Tom Bloomfield, our YC partner, said that we had a unique combination of company building and AI expertise. Sashank, my co-founder, has AI experience, and I had previously built a company. So he said, 'Why don't you guys go vertical? Pick an industry and partner with it.' It was a hard choice at that point because we didn't come from any industry.</p>
</details>

于是我们制定了一些规则。我们设定了三个标准：拥有大量非结构化数据的行业可能是好行业，因为现在**大语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models）可以更快地处理这些数据；以及劳动力短缺和利润空间缩小的行业。第一个标准从技术角度解释了“为什么是现在”，而后面两个标准则从商业角度解释了“为什么是现在”。这样可以确保我们构建的任何产品都能更快地被采纳。因此，我们筛选出了三个行业：抵押贷款、法律和保险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we actually created some rules. We identified three criteria: industries with a lot of unstructured data could be good industries because now LLMs can process that faster; and industries with labor shortages and shrinking margins. The first criterion explains 'why now' in terms of technology, while the latter two explain 'why now' in terms of business. This ensures that whatever we build will be adopted faster. So, we shortlisted three industries: mortgage, legal, and insurance.</p>
</details>

我记得我们带着一盒甜甜圈，在湾区四处奔波，从一个保险代理人到另一个，了解他们的工作流程，并讨论他们面临的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember we drove around the Bay Area with a box of donuts, going from one insurance agent to another, learning about their workflows and discussing the problems they faced.</p>
</details>

至少可以说，那是一次令人紧张的经历。但我们在这个过程中学到了很多。我们也克服了最初对未知的恐惧。这为我们提供了对保险业现有不同工作流程的初步见解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was a scary experience, to say the least. But we learned a lot in that process. We also overcame our initial fear of the unknown, and that gave us initial insights into the different workflows that currently exist in insurance.</p>
</details>

我们利用了在这些实地考察中收集到的知识。回顾过去，凭借事后诸葛亮的视角，我感觉这反倒是一种因祸得福。我们从第一性原理的角度审视了每一个工作流程和每一个问题，没有预设“事情就该如此”的假设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We took the knowledge we gathered from these site visits. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, I feel that it was a blessing in disguise. We looked at every workflow and every problem from a first principles point of view, without making assumptions that 'that's how things should be'.</p>
</details>

我记得有一个工作流程，**承保团队**（underwriting teams: 保险公司中负责评估风险、决定是否承保及定价的团队）或**保险公司**（carriers: 在保险语境中指保险公司）会要求**保险经纪人**（brokers: 在保险语境中指保险经纪人）在他们的网站上填写表格。每个人都在构建这些网络门户，我觉得那可能不是最好的方式，因为经纪人不喜欢通过门户填写数据，也没有人喜欢。大家真正想要的是：“我可以直接把这份邮件发给你吗？”然而，很多团队却在投入金钱、时间和精力来构建这些门户。所以我们质疑道：“为什么不接受通过电子邮件提交，然后让AI将这些数据填入你们的内部门户，而不是让人工团队成员去做他们不喜欢的事情呢？”通过这种方式，你可以提高**提交到报价比率**（sub to code ratio: 提交的保险申请转化为报价的比例）、**报价到绑定比率**（code to bind ratio: 提供的保险报价最终被客户接受并签订合同的比例）等等。这既有利于业务，也有利于客户体验。因此，从第一性原理的角度思考问题，使我们能够真正构建出一些东西，我认为如果我来自这个行业，我可能就不会这么做，因为我可能会觉得“事情一直都是这样”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember one workflow where underwriting teams or carriers requested brokers to fill out forms on their website. Everybody was building these web portals, and I felt that was possibly not the best way because brokers didn't like filling data over portals, and nobody likes filling data over portals. What everybody wanted was, 'Can I just send this email to you?' A lot of teams were actually spending money, time, and energy building these portals. So we questioned that: 'Why don't you accept a submission over email and then let AI fill this data into your internal portals, rather than making human team members do that, which they don't like doing?' This way, you can increase the sub to code ratio, the code to bind ratio, and so on. It's good for business and good for customer experience. So, thinking of things from a first principles point of view allowed us to really build something that I think I might not have built if I had been from the industry, because I would have felt that 'this is how things have always been'.</p>
</details>

### 销售策略与客户体验

保险业通常被认为是技术采纳缓慢的行业，但我们在实际中看到的是，人们确实希望自动化那些手动且重复的工作流程。我学到的一点是，如今最好的销售工具是餐桌。你应该亲自与人见面，尝试进行对话，努力理解他们的问题。这不仅仅是关于他们购买产品，某种程度上也是关于他们认可你，说：“嘿，我想和你合作。”所以，一个重要的经验是：人与人之间是合作的。除此之外，我们学到的其他销售经验是：外向型销售是有效的。是的。但早期一个非常有效的诀窍叫做“让我看到你了解我”。尝试做一些YC所说的“无法规模化”的事情。所以我们写了很多极其个性化的邮件给人们。这确实有助于获得回复，因为对方知道你真的是为他们量身定制的这封邮件，而不是群发。写这样的邮件需要付出很多努力，但它确实有效。所以，设身处地为买家着想真的很有帮助。比如说，如果我购买一个价值10万美元的技术软件，我不想在试用之前就被锁定一年的合同。所以我们增加了两个月退出选项等。所有这些现在都是相当标准的做法，甚至YC也推荐所有这些。在构建这种企业销售模式时，第一次学习所有这些事情是很有趣的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Insurance is usually labeled as slow to adopt technology, but on the ground, what we were seeing was that people really wanted to automate workflows that were manual and repetitive. One thing I've learned is that the best sales tool today is a dinner table. You should meet people in person, try to have a conversation, try to understand their problems. It's equally about them buying the product, but it's also about them buying *you* in some sense, saying, 'Hey, I want to work with you.' So, that's one big learning: people work with people. Apart from that, another thing we learned about sales is that outbound sales work. Yes. But one big trick that worked in the early days is called 'show me you know me.' Try to actually do things that don't scale, as YC says. So, we wrote a lot of emails that were extremely personalized to people. That really helps in getting a response because then the other person knows that you've genuinely written that email just for them and not mass-mailed it. It takes a lot of effort to write such emails, but it really works. So, putting myself in the buyer's shoes really helps. Let's say if I'm buying technology software for $100,000, I don't want to be locked into a contract for a year before I even give it a spin. So, we added things like a two-month opt-out option and so on. All of these are now fairly standard practices; even YC recommends all of these things. It was interesting to learn all of these things for the first time when we were building this enterprise sales motion.</p>
</details>

### Further AI的愿景与个人哲学

我对Further AI有两个目标。第一个是建立一家上市公司。但第二个对我来说同样核心的目标是，为所有与Further AI接触的人——无论是我们的客户还是团队成员——搭建一个成功的发射台。这就是为什么当我们招聘员工或人们加入我们时，我们非常注重**高能动性低内耗**（high agency and low drama: 指员工积极主动、解决问题能力强，且团队内部冲突和负面情绪较少）的特质。我非常喜欢与这类人合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have two goals in mind with Further AI. The first one is to build a public company. But the second one, which is also very core to me, is to build a launchpad of success for people who come into contact with Further AI, whether they are our customers or our team members. That's why, when we hired people or when people joined us, it's been a lot about high agency and low drama. That's the kind of people I work really well with.</p>
</details>

我想有句话说得好，“你吸引你的同类”。对我来说，我就是那种喜欢解决难题、必要时会不惜一切代价的人。有趣的是，加入Further AI的团队也拥有相同的**基因**（DNA: 在此指团队成员共同的内在特质或文化）——他们喜欢攻克难题，如果解决问题或完成任务需要，他们不介意每天工作12小时。AI正在快速发展，我们都知道。好消息是，随着生态系统的演进，我们都在学习。我们希望从保险业的角度走在前沿，成为客户值得信赖的合作伙伴，引入AI带来的最新效率。因此，我们将自己定位在AI和保险的交汇点，并秉持着一个原则逆向工作：目标是推动业务指标，而不是为了技术而技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a saying, 'You attract your tribe.' For me, I'm the person who likes to solve hard problems, run through walls if I have to, and so on. Interestingly, the team that joined Further AI had the same DNA—people who like to work on hard problems, who don't mind grinding 12 hours a day if that's what it takes to solve a problem or get something done. AI is changing fast, we all know that. The good thing is that we are all learning as the ecosystem evolves. We want to be at the forefront of it from the insurance perspective and be that trusted partner for our customers to bring in the latest efficiencies that AI is introducing. So, we have positioned ourselves at the intersection of AI and insurance, working backward from the principle that the goal is to drive business metrics rather than just building technology for its own sake.</p>
</details>

从大学早期到微软，再到创立第一家公司，直至现在创立第二家公司，很多事情都发生了变化。作为一名二次创业者，有趣的是，低谷依然是低谷，但高潮却不再那么高，因为你知道总有更多的事情需要去建设。然而，话虽如此，我认为作为一个人，我变得更加耐心。我变得更加以人为本，我的叙事从“我、我”转向了“我们、我们”，这作为一个人来说更令人满足。我们正在努力成为保险和AI领域最好的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A lot has changed since my early college days, through Microsoft, to building my first company, and now building my second company. The funny thing about being a second-time founder is that the lows are still low, but the highs are not that high because you know there's always more to build. However, having said that, I think as a person, I have become more patient. I've become more people-first, and my narrative shifted from 'me, me' to 'we, we,' which is more satisfying as a human being. We're building towards being the best company in insurance and AI.</p>
</details>

我曾与人讨论我的自传标题：“半僧半机器”。这很有趣，我觉得它很好地描述了我这个人，因为当我全身心投入工作时，我就像一台机器，不停地运转。而在个人层面，我更像一个僧侣：我非常有耐心，我看到人们积极的一面，我是一个“半杯水是满的”乐观主义者，我努力做到凡事适度。我经常说的一句话，认识我的人听了可能会翻白眼，那就是“凡事适度是好的，甚至适度本身也需要适度”。这就是我“僧侣”的一面。所以，是的，希望有一天我的书名会是《半僧半机器》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was discussing with someone the title of my biography: 'Half Monk, Half Machine.' It's interesting; I think that describes me really well as a person because when I'm wired in or logged in, I'm like a machine, clocking work. On the personal side, I'm more like a monk: I'm very patient, I look for the positive in people, I'm a 'glass half full' guy, and I try to moderate a lot. One of the things I say very often, and people who know me would possibly roll their eyes after listening to this, is 'everything is good in moderation, even moderation.' That's the monk side of me. So yeah, hopefully someday the book title will be 'Half Monk, Half Machine.'</p>
