### 引言：生与死的哲学拷问

True or false? You, Brian Johnson, the man sitting across from me, one day, at some point, as of yet undefined in the future, you will die.

对还是错？布莱恩·约翰逊，坐在我对面的这个人，有一天，在未来某个尚未确定的时刻，你会死去。

False.

错。

Narrator: Sold Venmo for $800 million. Has spent a fortune on a quest to stay young forever.

旁白：他以8亿美元的价格出售了Venmo。为了永葆青春，他投入了巨额财富。

Bryan Johnson: Don't die is the general theme of what we're trying to do. It's humanity's only objective. None of us live forever except Brian Johnson.

布莱恩·约翰逊：不死亡是我们正在努力的普遍主题。这是人类唯一的目的。除了布莱恩·约翰逊，我们没有人能永生。

Host: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Brian Johnson.

主持人：女士们先生们，请欢迎布莱恩·约翰逊。

### 身体平衡测试：你的生物年龄是多少？

Hi guys. Everybody stand up. What you're going to do is you're going to choose your left or your right foot.

大家好。请大家站起来。你们要做的是选择你们的左脚或右脚。

I'm going to count down from three and you're going to stay standing on your selected foot as long as you can with your eyes closed.

我将从三开始倒数，然后你们闭上眼睛，尽可能长时间地单脚站立。

Hands by your side. Your foot's got to be somewhere close by; you can't be clear out. So, just choose right or left foot.

双手放在身体两侧。你的脚必须靠近身体，不能伸得太远。所以，请选择你的右脚或左脚。

And those of you on the balcony, be careful. If somebody fell off, that'd be a bad situation.

阳台上的各位，请小心。如果有人掉下去，那会很糟糕。

Foot selected. Let me pull out my timer. And I'm going to count the number of seconds that pass. Ready? 3, 2, 1. Close your eyes.

选好脚了吗？我拿出计时器。我将计算流逝的秒数。准备好了吗？3、2、1。闭上眼睛。

5 seconds. 10 seconds. And your foot can't move; it must remain stationary. 15. 20. Okay, we'll stop there. Who's still up?

5秒。10秒。你的脚不能动；它必须保持静止。15秒。20秒。好了，我们停在这里。谁还站着？

Okay, good. We'll do it one more time. No, no, stay up. This is a **biological age** (Biological Age: 身体器官和功能相对于实际年龄的衰老程度) test.

好的，不错。我们再做一次。不，不，请保持站立。这是一个**生物年龄**测试。

As you age, part of your brain that keeps you well balanced atrophies and you can't maintain a balance very well.

随着年龄增长，大脑中维持平衡的部分会萎缩，你就无法很好地保持平衡。

So, kids are very good at this. As you age, you get worse.

所以，孩子们在这方面表现很好。随着年龄增长，你会变得越来越差。

So if you are between 15 and 30 seconds, that's roughly age 20 to 40. 7 to 15 seconds, you're between 40 and 60. And 0 to 7, you're 60 plus.

所以，如果你能坚持15到30秒，那大致相当于20到40岁。7到15秒，你介于40到60岁之间。0到7秒，你就是60岁以上。

Audience: as an age category. Okay.

观众：作为年龄类别。好的。

Yep. All right. Ready? Okay. You can choose again. Right or left foot? Your foot's got to be stationary. You can't move it around. Arms close by. Three, two, one, go.

好的。准备好了吗？你可以再选一次。右脚还是左脚？你的脚必须保持静止，不能四处移动。手臂靠近身体。三、二、一，开始。

Five. 10. 15. 20. Make it to 30, you guys. 10 more seconds. 30. Okay, cool. Good job, you guys. All right, you can take a seat.

5秒。10秒。15秒。20秒。大家坚持到30秒。再坚持10秒。30秒。好的，太棒了。大家做得很好。好了，请坐。

### 了解你的生物年龄：器官的秘密

This is the neat thing about biological age testing is you of course know when you were born and therefore you know how many years you've lived.

**生物年龄**测试的奇妙之处在于，你当然知道自己何时出生，因此也知道自己活了多少年。

You can look at yourself in the mirror and say, I have a few wrinkles or a few spots. But actually in your body, your organs have different ages.

你可以照镜子，说自己有一些皱纹或斑点。但实际上，在你体内，你的器官有着不同的年龄。

So, your lungs are a certain age, your brain, your eyes, your ears, your gums, your pancreas, your liver, they're all different biological ages.

所以，你的肺部有一个特定的年龄，你的大脑、眼睛、耳朵、牙龈、胰腺、肝脏，它们都有不同的**生物年龄**。

And it's really important to know. For example, I'm 47, but my left ear is 64 years old.

了解这一点非常重要。例如，我今年47岁，但我的左耳已经64岁了。

It's because I shot a lot of guns as a kid. I was right-handed like this with a lot of exposure in my ear. And I also listen to a lot of loud music.

这是因为我小时候经常射击。我是右撇子，这样持枪时，我的左耳暴露在很多噪音中。而且我也听很多大声的音乐。

And so that's really important for me to know because when you have hearing loss and you don't correct for it with a hearing aid, it can result in **cognitive decline** (Cognitive Decline: 认知能力下降，包括记忆、思维和推理能力减弱).

所以这对我来说非常重要，因为当你出现听力损失而没有通过助听器进行矫正时，它可能导致**认知能力下降**。

So this applies to all things about the heart.

这同样适用于所有与心脏相关的事情。

### 永生之问：人类的终极目标

A couple years ago, I posed this question: Are we really the first generation who won't die?

几年前，我提出了这个问题：我们真的是第一代不会死亡的人吗？

It's kind of the coolest question in existence. What matters more than our experience, our ability to live?

这可以说是现存最酷的问题。有什么比我们的经历、我们生存的能力更重要呢？

And so to do this, I wanted to do an experiment. So, I measured the biological age of every organ in my body as much as we could.

为了实现这个目标，我想进行一项实验。所以，我们尽可能地测量了我体内每个器官的**生物年龄**。

We then went through the scientific evidence and we tried to reverse and or slow down my speed of aging.

然后我们查阅了科学证据，并尝试逆转或减缓我的衰老速度。

And what I've been trying to do is create a sport or a new genre of what it means to be healthy.

我一直在尝试做的是创造一种运动，或者说一种关于健康的全新范式。

And so, I put my **biomarkers** (Biomarkers: 可客观测量和评估的生物学指标，用于指示生理过程、病理过程或对治疗干预的药理学反应) out and said, I have the best **biomarkers** of anybody in the world.

因此，我公布了我的**生物标志物**，并表示我拥有世界上最好的**生物标志物**。

Anyone's willing, anyone's capable of competing with me. But try to make it like a quantified thing where it's just like I'm healthy or not.

任何人都可以，任何人都有能力与我竞争。但要把它变成一个量化的东西，就像我健康与否一样。

And so it's been a really fun journey. And so today I'm going to tell you guys in just a few minutes time everything I've learned about health.

所以这是一段非常有趣的旅程。今天我将在几分钟内告诉大家我所学到的一切关于健康的东西。

I'm going to compress it into some very simple lessons for you because health is really complicated. It's very confusing. It's all consuming. It's overwhelming. Cool.

我将把它浓缩成一些非常简单的经验教训，因为健康确实很复杂。它非常令人困惑。它耗费所有精力。它令人不知所措。很酷。

Audience: Okay.

观众：好的。

### 健康第一要务：优化睡前静息心率

So first, who got eight hours of sleep last night? 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Thank you for your honesty. Two. There. Thank you, sir. One. Yeah, I appreciate that.

首先，昨晚谁睡了八个小时？7、6、5、4、3。谢谢你们的诚实。2。还有。谢谢这位先生。1。是的，我很感谢。

Who has a confession to make? Who recently polished off a bag of chips, ate some ice cream, and then jammed some Twizzlers? What did you do, sir?

谁要坦白？谁最近吃完了一整包薯片，吃了一些冰淇淋，然后又塞了一些Twizzlers？这位先生，你做了什么？

Audience: Chips. A whole bag. One sitting. All right. Great. Who else? Yeah. What did you do? Gelato.

观众：薯片。一整包。一次吃完。好的。太棒了。还有谁？是的。你做了什么？意式冰淇淋。

Audience: Gelato. Yeah, I get it. Okay, cool.

观众：意式冰淇淋。是的，我懂了。好的，很酷。

Okay, so you guys, the single best thing I've learned out of everything I've ever done is your **resting heart rate** (Resting Heart Rate: 在休息状态下每分钟的心跳次数) before sleep is the best thing you can do for your health. Hands down.

好的，各位，我所做的一切中，学到的最好的一件事就是你睡前的**静息心率**是你为健康所能做的最好的事情。毫无疑问。

Okay, so here's what you're going to do tonight. Before you go to bed, you're going to get a baseline read.

好的，所以今晚你们要做的是。睡觉前，你们要测量一个基线读数。

You're either with a wearable or just on your fingers on the neck. You're going to lay down on your bed, take a few deep breaths. You're going to find your **resting heart rate**.

你可以使用可穿戴设备，或者只是用手指按在脖子上。你躺在床上，做几次深呼吸。你会找到你的**静息心率**。

Let's say it's 60 beats per minute. Okay, your goal over the next month is to lower your heart rate by 10% or so. So, if you're 60, be down to 54.

假设是每分钟60次。好的，你未来一个月的M标是将心率降低10%左右。所以，如果你的心率是60，就降到54。

And here's how you're going to do it. If your bedtime's at 10 p.m., eat your final meal of the day at 6 p.m. After 6, no more food, no more snacks.

以下是你将如何做到这一点。如果你的睡觉时间是晚上10点，那么在晚上6点吃完你当天的最后一餐。6点以后，不再进食，不再吃零食。

By doing that, you allow your body to digest your food. And you're going to see that as you do that, your heart rate is going to go down.

通过这样做，你让你的身体有时间消化食物。你会发现，当你这样做时，你的心率会下降。

And the reason why heart rate is so important is the lower your heart rate is, the better your sleep.

心率如此重要的原因在于，你的心率越低，你的睡眠就越好。

The better your sleep, the better your willpower. Did you know if you don't sleep, your **prefrontal cortex** (Prefrontal Cortex: 大脑中负责决策、意志力等高级认知功能的区域) goes offline and you lose your willpower.

你的睡眠越好，你的意志力就越强。你知道吗，如果你不睡觉，你的**前额叶皮层**就会“下线”，你就会失去意志力。

So when you're trying to not eat the cookie, you're powerless. You can't do it. It's gone.

所以当你试图不吃饼干时，你无能为力。你做不到。它已经消失了。

So sleep is the best performance-enhancing drug in the whole world. It's the thing you want to do every night.

所以睡眠是全世界最好的提高表现的“药物”。这是你每晚都想做的事情。

### 提升睡眠质量的五大策略

So first thing is eat your final meal 4 hours before bed.

所以第一件事是在睡前4小时吃完最后一餐。

Number two is you need to turn your screens off an hour before bed.

第二，你需要在睡前一小时关掉屏幕。

Now I realize that's hard. We are all addicted to our phones, but that 1 hour is so important because you have to give your body ability to wind down.

我知道这很难。我们都沉迷于手机，但那一小时非常重要，因为你必须让你的身体有能力放松下来。

And if you're scrolling or working, you're going to be in a roused state, which boosts your heart rate. Anything that boosts your heart rate before bed is going to be bad for you.

如果你在刷手机或工作，你就会处于一种兴奋状态，这会提高你的心率。任何在睡前提高心率的事情对你都是不利的。

Three is you want to have amber and red lights in your house. No blues like these are very blue.

第三，你家里应该使用琥珀色和红色的灯光。不要使用像这些（现场的灯光）这样非常蓝的灯光。

You want to be mindful of your stimulants. So noon thereabouts is when you want to stop your caffeine intake because caffeine has roughly a 6-hour **half-life** (Half-life: 物质在生物体内浓度或活性降低一半所需的时间).

你需要注意你的兴奋剂摄入。所以大约中午时分是你应该停止摄入咖啡因的时候，因为咖啡因大约有6小时的**半衰期**。

So if you have a cup of coffee at 4 p.m., at bedtime, half a cup of coffee is still in your system.

所以如果你在下午4点喝了一杯咖啡，到睡觉时，半杯咖啡的量仍然在你的体内。

And then finally you want to have some kind of wind-down routine where you read a book, go for a walk, do breath work, meditate, but something to calm yourself down.

最后，你想要有一些放松的例行活动，比如读书、散步、做呼吸练习、冥想，总之是能让你平静下来的事情。

### 睡眠与心理健康：对抗焦虑和抑郁

Okay, now just be sober with me for a minute. I promise you this is the single best thing you can do for your health.

好了，现在请和我一起冷静思考一分钟。我向你保证，这是你为自己的健康所能做的最好的一件事。

And if we're honest, the majority of you in this room have some moderate to serious mental health problem. Tell me I'm wrong.

如果我们诚实一点，这个房间里的大多数人都有一些中度到严重的心理健康问题。你说我错了吗？

(Waiting) It's true. If you sample your friends, you'll see it's a pretty tough environment right now.

（等待）这是真的。如果你问问你的朋友，你会发现现在是一个相当艰难的环境。

We are on our phones all the time. We don't sleep well. We eat junk food. It's very hard to take a moment for ourselves to be healthy.

我们总是盯着手机。我们睡不好。我们吃垃圾食品。我们很难为自己抽出时间来保持健康。

I promise you, optimize your **resting heart rate** and it's going to be the very best thing you do for your mood.

我向你保证，优化你的**静息心率**将是你为改善情绪所做的最好的一件事。

If you're experiencing anxiety or depression or you're having some other kind of difficulty, I'm telling you, high quality sleep is the thing.

如果你正在经历焦虑或抑郁，或者你正在经历其他某种困难，我告诉你，高质量的睡眠是关键。

And culture that tells us right now that you have to grind and not sleep is a lie.

而现在告诉我们必须努力工作、不能睡觉的文化，是一个谎言。

It's a bad deal for you. You can be ambitious. You can have unhinged ideas about the world and still sleep.

这对你来说是个糟糕的交易。你可以有抱负。你可以对世界有疯狂的想法，并且仍然可以好好睡觉。

### “不死”：人类的下一个主要意识形态

Okay. So, I've got 20 seconds left. Who's going to commit to this?

好的。我还有20秒。谁会承诺做到这一点？

Audience: Yep.

观众：是的。

Who's not? So, I can shame you. Okay. Why? Why are you not going to commit?

谁不会？这样我就可以让你感到羞愧。好的。为什么？你为什么不承诺？

Audience: I'm a startup founder.

观众：我是一个创业公司创始人。

Bryan Johnson: Okay, there we go. This is it, you guys. Yes, you're a startup founder.

布莱恩·约翰逊：好的，就是这样。各位，就是这样。是的，你是一个创业公司创始人。

The narrative is you have to martyr yourself, literally martyr yourself to achieve success. That is not true.

这种说法是，你必须牺牲自己，真正地牺牲自己才能取得成功。那不是真的。

You will be a better founder/parent/partner/whatever if you prioritize your sleep. I'm telling you, it is a false idea. Don't fall for it.

如果你优先考虑睡眠，你将成为一个更好的创始人/父母/伴侣/任何角色。我告诉你，这是一个错误的观念。不要相信它。

Don't die. Yes, it's about health. It's also the next major ideology for the human race.

不要死亡。是的，这关乎健康。它也是人类的下一个主要意识形态。

We are giving birth to super intelligence. Our ideas about reality are going to shift. Existence itself will be the highest virtue.

我们正在孕育超级智能。我们对现实的看法将会改变。存在本身将是最高的德行。

Don't die is the next major ideology on par with democracy, capitalism, Christianity, Islam. It is the next thing we do as a species.

“不死亡”是与民主、资本主义、基督教、伊斯兰教并驾齐驱的下一个主要意识形态。这是我们作为一个物种将要做的下一件事。

So friends, be well. Go to bed on time. Am I seeing this? You committed? All right, guys. Be well.

所以朋友们，保重身体。按时睡觉。我看到了吗？你承诺了吗？好的，各位。保重。
