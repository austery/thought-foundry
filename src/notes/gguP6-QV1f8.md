title: Beyond Meat股价飙升与市场动荡：解析特斯拉财报前的关键信号
summary: 本周市场开盘即迎来剧烈波动。Beyond Meat股价因与沃尔玛合作及高达60%的空头头寸而飙升近100%，引发市场对“Meme股”狂热重现的讨论。与此同时，动量股和黄金价格普遍下挫，显示出资金轮动的迹象。科技巨头方面，Netflix因巴西税务问题导致财报不及预期，而谷歌则凭借与Anthropic的潜在云合作利好消息提振股价。在特斯拉即将发布财报之际，市场情绪复杂，地缘政治和美国政府停摆等宏观因素也为前景增添了不确定性。

### 开盘焦点：Beyond Meat 股价异常飙升

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是10月22日，星期三。在盘前市场中，有一只股票上涨了大约70%，现在涨幅已经扩大到98%。我说的就是 Beyond Meat。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, October 22nd. And well, we have a pre-market where one stock is up about 70%. Don't really know why, but nonetheless, it is indeed up. A lot of you guys know which one I'm talking about, and this is, I think, kind of one of the main stories of the day, and we're going to see how it plays out. Sorry, it's not up 70%. It's up 98% now. Talking about Beyond Meat.</p>
</details>

我真不知道为什么我们不能拥有一个正常的市场，为什么总有这类股票上演如此疯狂的行情。昨天收盘时，Beyond Meat 的股价是4.45美元，而现在已经达到了7.29美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know why we just can't have a normal market. I don't know why we have to have these types of stocks do what they do, but this is what they're doing. Beyond Meat, we left the market closed yesterday and this thing was $4.45. It is now $7.29.</p>
</details>

如果我们看一下期权流数据，会发现相当惊人。不仅期权交易量巨大，而且有些人在股价只有两美元左右时就已经做多了。在过去一周里，Beyond Meat 的股价从50美分基本上涨到了8美元，实现了16倍的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you look at the options flow, and we're going to look at some stats on Beyond Meat, it's quite incredible some of the amount of trades that are coming in in terms of the option flow, but also some of the people that went long on this thing back when it was like two bucks. Maybe they knew something was coming, but there you go. Beyond Meat has 16xed over the past week from 50 cents to eight bucks basically. I think it was at like 8.50 a little bit earlier before right now.</p>
</details>

对于这只股票，我选择在场边观望。昨天该公司宣布了与沃尔玛的合作关系，这无疑是一个利好消息，考虑到股价的涨幅，这显然是重大利好。此外，该股的空头头寸比例高达60%，我认为这是推动其股价如此波动的另一个原因。这有点像散户试图挤压做空该股的对冲基金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, I am watching on the sidelines from this for those who are in it. Um, do what you got to do. If you got to trade it, you got to trade it. The Walmart partnership was announced yesterday and I guess that is somewhat bullish. Well, it's obviously more than somewhat bullish given the stock has run as much as it's run. It was also short at 60%. So I think that's another reason why Beyond Meat is moving the way it's moving. But nonetheless, we're going to see when the market opens when a lot more capital comes into not only this stock but a lot of other stocks and algos get in place what actually happens if retail gets in. There's a little bit of a story on retail trying to squeeze the hedge funds that are shorting it. So we'll talk more about kind of what's going on here. But nonetheless, Beyond Meat, one of the biggest runners today, is up 100% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

有人说，资金正在从其他动量股流出，涌入 Beyond Meat 这个新“玩具”。我们将观察这种情况是否会持续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All the money going into Beyond Meat. Yeah, maybe a lot of the money is leaving those other momentum names and it's just going to into the new toy which is Beyond Meat. We're going to see if that ends up continuing to play out.</p>
</details>

### 科技巨头财报季：Netflix 意外受挫，谷歌迎来利好

除了 Beyond Meat，我们还有很多其他头条新闻。昨天，谷歌和亚马逊都发生了一些事情。谷歌在盘前上涨了约2.25%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, outside of that, we got a bunch of other headlines. So, we had some Google, Amazon stuff that happened yesterday. We'll talk about that. Google right there, they're up about 2.25% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

我们先从 Netflix 的财报开始。昨天 Netflix 公布了财报，今天晚些时候特斯拉也将公布财报，我们会做一个详细的预览。Netflix 的季度表现不错，但问题是他们与巴西税务机关存在争议，导致公司不得不支付6.9亿美元的罚款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also let's not forget we had Netflix earnings yesterday which I think we'll start off with along with Tesla earnings later today which we'll do a big preview on. In terms of what we have with Netflix, so let's just start off with that, then we'll get to some of the other earnings that we had today. Netflix had a good quarter. The problem is they had a Brazilian tax dispute with some authorities, which caused a $690 million uh penalty that they had to pay.</p>
</details>

结果，他们的营业利润率受到了约3%的冲击，净利润在每股收益（EPS）方面下降了16%。因此，Netflix 的每股收益为5.87美元，而预期为6.97美元，未达标16%。营收则符合预期。Netflix 在盘前交易中下跌。我认为这对 Netflix 来说不是什么大问题，它终究是一家卓越的公司，长期来看会继续执行和增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, their operating margins got hit by about 3% and that means their actual net income got hit by 16% in terms of EPS. So Netflix right there, 5.87 versus 6.97 missed by 16%. Revenue came in line with expectations. Netflix is down in the pre-market. I think this is not a real big deal for Netflix. At the end of the day, Netflix is a phenomenal company and they will continue to keep executing and continue to grow over the long term.</p>
</details>

然而，对于那些期望他们能大幅超出预期的投资者来说，他们并没有做到。这是一个不错的季度，但并非一个惊艳的季度。有人可能会说，这甚至算不上一个很好的季度，因为当你的每股收益未达标16%时，即使是由于巴西税务机关等不可控因素，仍然会带来一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, for the people that thought they were going to smash earnings, they didn't, right? It was a good quarter. It was not a phenomenal quarter. One could argue it's not even a great quarter because when you miss by 16% on EPS, even if it's something that's out of your control like Brazilian tax authorities, that can still cause some pain. And unfortunately, that pain is why the street did not get excited for Netflix.</p>
</details>

我不认为这会传染给所有大型科技公司。我认为这只是 Netflix 的个别问题。我们今天还有特斯拉的财报，我希望特斯拉能有好的业绩，但并不期待有惊人的表现。即使特斯拉和 Netflix 的财报没有那么亮眼，我认为这也不代表 Meta、微软、谷歌等公司会有糟糕的业绩。那些才是真正重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think this is a uh contagion with all the Mac tech all the Mac 7 companies. I think this is isolated towards Netflix and you know unfortunately it sucks that Netflix has to kick off big tech earnings with this. We do have Tesla today and you know I hope Tesla has good earnings but I'm not expecting anything massive and you know if we don't get something massive from Tesla, Netflix I don't think that's emblematic of Meta, Microsoft, Google etc. not having good earnings. Those are the ones that really, really, really matter.</p>
</details>

有人可能会说，Netflix 与其他科技公司无关。归根结底，Netflix 是一家媒体公司。它也是一家科技公司，但他们购买媒体内容，并以此销售订阅服务。他们不像其他**超大规模云服务提供商**（Hyperscalers: 指像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样提供大规模云计算服务的公司）那样花费4500亿美元在资本支出上进行竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And you know, one can make the argument Netflix has nothing to do with the rest of tech. At the end of the day, Netflix is a media company. It is a tech company, but they buy media and they sell a subscription against that media. They are not the ones spending $450 billion on capex to try to, you know, compete with the other hyperscalers. From that perspective, I don't think it would be that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

再来看看谷歌，它在盘前交易中上涨。原因是在盘后，有传言称主要使用 AWS 的 Anthropic 可能会与谷歌签订一份价值数百亿美元的云计算协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Transitioning to Google, though, uh Google is up in the pre-markets. Why is Google up in the pre-markets? Well, uh yesterday after hours, this bad boy got all the way up to 257, right now at 255. So, Google fell to 244 yesterday when there were rumors of OpenAI launching a new browser. OpenAI did launch that browser. We'll talk about it in a second. But then after hours you had anthropic rumors around, hey, Anthropic, which has largely used AWS, might end up signing a multiple tens of billions of dollar deal with Google for cloud computing.</p>
</details>

> 谷歌可能达成一项新的云协议，计算价值可能高达数百亿美元。据彭博社报道，到目前为止，亚马逊一直是其主要的基础设施提供商和最大的支持者，向该公司投资了约80亿美元。谷歌已投入约30亿美元，并支持 Anthropic 的多云战略。谷歌股价在盘后上涨超过3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Google on a new cloud deal potentially worth tens of billions of dollars in compute. That's according to Bloomberg. So far, Amazon has been its main infrastructure provider and its largest backer, investing around $8 billion into the company. Google has put in about $3 billion and has supported Anthropic's multicloud strategy. I reached out to both companies, haven't heard back yet. I will say this, Google was down all day because of that OpenAI web browser, but those shares bouncing higher in the after hours, up more than 3% now, Mel.</p>
</details>

我认为这对谷歌来说是相当利好的。如果 Anthropic 考虑使其云支出多样化，而谷歌成为受益者，那将是积极的。这对亚马逊来说是否利空？不尽然。亚马逊已经从 Anthropic 身上赚了很多钱。有传言称，仅今年一年，Anthropic 就向亚马逊支付了超过30亿美元的 AWS 费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, I thought that was actually pretty bullish for Google because at the end of the day, if Anthropic's thinking of diversifying their cloud revenue spend, then you know, Google being the beneficiary of that and maybe not Microsoft as much as their competitors. That is bullish. Now, is it bearish? Amazon, not really. Amazon already makes a ton of money off anthropic. I mean, there were rumors that they paid them over $3 billion in AWS just this year alone.</p>
</details>

至于 OpenAI 推出的新浏览器 Atlas，我真的认为这没什么大不了的。它看起来像 Perplexity 的 Comet，而且我不明白为什么 Chrome 不能做同样的事情。它只是一个在角落或侧边带有人工智能助手的网页浏览器。我认为 Chrome 应该很快推出类似的产品来与之抗衡，并告诉用户他们不需要使用这样的东西，尤其是因为 Chrome 拥有分发渠道的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of their new browser, again, I really do think it's a nothing burger. It it's it's not it's not the most exciting thing to me when you take a look at this browser. And and the the thing is, number one, it looks like Perplexity's comet. And number two, I don't know why Chrome's not going to be able to do this either. I I like all it is is a a web browser with an AI assistant on the corner or on the side. I think Chrome should like quickly come out with something that uh that rivals this and just shows you, hey, you don't need to use something like this, especially because they have the distribution.</p>
</details>

### 市场轮动：动量股与黄金价格双双下挫

本周我们一直在讨论的一个主题是，像 Oklo、D-Wave 这类动量股正在失去势头。在盘前交易中，情况并没有好转。像 Oklo 这样的股票在盘前继续受到冲击，下跌了4%。D-Wave 也下跌了约5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and the theme that we've been talking about for this past week is some of these momentum stocks like the Oakloss, the D-Waves of the world, they've been losing a lot of their momentum based on just looking at their stock prices. And look, in the pre-markets, it's not that much better. Now, it's a red premarket, but it's not a deep red pre-market. Some of those names like in Oaklo continue to get hit in the pre-market, down 4%. You got a D-Wave right there that's down about 5%.</p>
</details>

我认为今天将是一个非常重要的日子，因为昨天所有这些股票都下跌了10%。如果这种情况连续第二天持续下去，这些股票可能会出现一些问题。如果标普500指数继续走高或至少保持稳定，而这些动量股继续下跌，那就意味着市场正在决定放弃这些股票，转而回到那些真正驱动市场的重要股票上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think today is going to be a really important day because yesterday all these names were down 10%. If that continues for a second day in a row, we might have some issues in these names. If the and if the S&P continues to go higher or at least stay stable, Nvidia stays at 180, Nvidia doesn't tank to 160 while Oaklo's tanking, you know, 30 40%. That means the market's deciding, oh, we are done playing with these stocks and we are going back to the important stocks that actually run the market.</p>
</details>

与此同时，比特币和以太坊未能获得太多动力。比特币昨天一度涨至11.4万美元，但到收盘时又回落至10.8万美元。以太坊也从4100美元回落到3800美元。它们之前因黄金上涨而获得的一些动力似乎正在消退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum and Bitcoin unfortunately have not been able to get a lot of momentum. The problem with Ethereum and Bitcoin right here is uh Bitcoin went up to 114 yesterday. It came all the way down to 108 by the end of the day. Now it's back at 108. Uh and then Ethereum got to 4100 right back down to 3,800. So a lot of the momentum that they saw for a little bit potentially based on the rally of gold dying out which we'll talk about in a second. It's almost like that money came to crypto and that money left crypto.</p>
</details>

现在我们来谈谈黄金。黄金表现不佳，又下跌了1.5%。白银也下跌了1%。尽管黄金之前经历了大幅上涨，但在过去两天里，其市值已经蒸发了2.5万亿美元，这是自2013年以来最大的两日跌幅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, let's talk about gold. So, gold is uh not doing the best. It's down another 1.5% as you can see right there. Silver down another 1%. The hard thing to understand about gold is that although it's had it massive rally, it has lost 2.5 trillion of market cap um over the past two days. Another 8% decline. This is the largest two-day drop since 2013.</p>
</details>

我认为，作为市场参与者，大家应该关注的最重要的事情是：黄金会复苏吗？动量股会复苏吗？我们谈论的动量不仅仅是像亚马逊、谷歌那样有动力的公司，而是指那些没有大量营收和利润，但凭借叙事获得巨大动力的**高贝塔**（High Beta: 指波动性远大于整体市场的股票）股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the biggest thing a lot of people should be watching out for just as a market participant is, hey, is gold going to recover? Are momentum stocks going to recover? And we're not just talking about momentum as in, you know, Amazon, Google that have momentum. We're talking about massive high beta names that don't really have tons and tons of revenue earnings, but have a lot of momentum carrying them on their narratives. Are they going to recover?</p>
</details>

如果它们和黄金都不能复苏，甚至只是横盘整理，那就意味着市场正在发生一些结构性转变。未来几天，如果这些数字没有任何起色，情况就会变得非常明显。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if they don't recover and if gold doesn't recover, maybe they even go sideways even if they don't keep going down, that means there's some structural shifts happen happening in this market. And I think it would become pretty evident over the next coming days if you don't see any level of movement a top on those numbers.</p>
</details>

### 宏观与地缘政治动态

我们来看一些地缘政治新闻。《金融时报》报道称，在特朗普与普京的会晤被取消后，俄罗斯袭击了乌克兰。这在昨天特朗普谈及普京时已经有所暗示。他被明确问及是否想与普京会面，他回答说“不”，他不想浪费时间。现在看来，我们正在看到这一决定的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um Russia Ukraine all right we got some headlines there so I think this is stuff that was talked about um last night as well when Trump was speaking the Financial Times right here saying Russia strikes Ukraine after Trump Putin meeting cancelled a lot of this was hinted did yesterday based on what Trump said about Putin. He was explicitly asked if you want to meet with Putin and he said no. He doesn't want to waste his time. And well, now it looks like we're actually seeing the ramifications of that.</p>
</details>

> 我不想开一场浪费时间的会议。我不想浪费时间。所以，我会看看情况如何。但是，我们达成了所有这些伟大的协议，伟大的和平协议。它们都是和平协议，坚实的协议，每一个都是。但这个不是。我说，“到前线去，到战场的前线去，然后你们撤回来，回家，大家都休息一下”，因为你们有两个国家在互相残杀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't want to have a wasted meeting. I don't want to have a waste of time. So, I'll see what happens. But, uh, we did all of these, uh, great deals, great peace deals. They're all peace deals, agreements, solid agreements, every one of them, but this one. And I said, "Go to the line. Go to the line of uh battle on the battlefield lines and you pull back and you go home and everybody take some time off because you got two countries that are killing each other.</p>
</details>

现在，俄罗斯在过去几周里一直在袭击乌克兰，所以这并非长时间以来的首次袭击。这正是特朗普感到愤怒的部分原因，因为他们没有停止袭击乌克兰，也没有同意任何形式的停火。这显示了这场冲突是多么根深蒂固，要达成谈判是多么困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, Russia has been striking Ukraine for the past couple weeks now. So, it's it's not like this is like the first strike in a long time. I mean, this is part of the reason why Trump is pissed off, right? is because they haven't stopped striking Ukraine and they haven't agreed to any level of a ceasefire. This is after the Putin phone call he had last week which he said you know was reasonable uh in terms of getting to some level of negotiation and this was after the Zalinsky meeting in the Oval Office. So even after both meetings and this is like multiple meetings he's had this year with both of these guys especially after the Alaska conference they had back in in June still no progress on this. I mean, it goes to show how unbelievably deep this conflict is and how hard it is to really get to a negotiation here.</p>
</details>

与此同时，美国政府停摆仍在继续。贸易代表詹姆森·格里尔（Jameson Greer）早上发表了一些看法，他基本上表示民主党人继续阻碍谈判。这和我们每天听到的故事一样，一方指责另一方。我们已经进入停摆的第21天了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of deals, government shutdown still in place. You had a trade representative Jameson Greer give some thoughts in the morning and basically he said that the Democrats continue to hold up the negotiations which again Mike Johnson and Trump and all these it's the same story every single day. One side blaming the other. We are now 21 days into the shutdown.</p>
</details>

昨天的头条新闻还说，特朗普表示在政府重新开放之前，他不会与民主党人对话。如果民主党人想在政府开放前谈判以达成协议，而特朗普在政府开放后才愿意谈，那么双方就陷入了僵局。目前市场对此并不太在意，但我认为如果这种情况持续超过30天，市场可能会开始关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The headline yesterday as well was that Trump said he is not going to speak to the Democrats until the government is reopened. So, I mean, if the Democrats don't want to talk until the government until the the Democrats want to talk before the government is open to get to a deal and Trump's not willing to talk until after it's open, you got two sides that are at a standstill. And I don't know how it's going to be resolved. Again, markets don't care about it too much right now, but I think if this lasts more than 30 days, you know, and we're nine days away from that happening, markets might start to care.</p>
</details>

在贸易方面，美国贸易代表詹姆森·格里尔谈到了与中国在稀土问题上的紧张关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's Jameson Greer, our China trade representative, and here's what he had to say this morning about some updates on what's happening with China.</p>
</details>

> 由于中国在稀土方面采取了一些新措施，出现了一些非常困难的问题。我们在日内瓦达成了一项协议，他们将限制稀土出口管制，降低报复性关税，而我们将暂停大部分对等关税。我们遵守了我们的承诺，但几周前，中国人决定再次扩大对稀土的管制。现实是，他们只是想对世界施加经济控制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Really difficult issues that have come up due to some new Chinese measures on rare earths. In Geneva, we had an agreement where they would limit their rare earth export controls. They'd keep their retaliatory tariffs down and we would suspend uh a good portion of our our tariffs uh on the reciprocal tariff. And so we we kept our part. We kept that tariff low and we had very cordial and constructive discussions over the summer. And then again a couple of weeks ago, the Chinese decided they were just going to go ahead and expand those controls on rare earths again, not not on just us, but on on the whole world. The reality is they just want to exert economic control on the world.</p>
</details>

> 过去20年与他们的贸易关系很大程度上是中国可以广泛进入美国市场，而美国进入中国市场的机会却相当有限。他们当然喜欢这种安排。我们不能再这样下去了。所以我们需要一条替代路径。问题是，中国人是否接受这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the trading relationship over the past 20 years with them has very has very much been China has broad and wide access to the US market. Uh and the US has had quite limited access to the Chinese market. Of course, they like that deal. They like that setup. We can't live that way anymore. So, we need an alternative path. The question is, do the Chinese accept this? Do the Chinese want to do it.</p>
</details>

不过，彭博社报道称，印度正接近与美国达成一项协议。美印两国即将敲定一项长期停滞的贸易协定，该协定将把美国对印度出口产品的关税从50%降至15%。作为协议的一部分，印度可能会减少俄罗斯石油的进口，并为美国玉米和豆粕开放市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Bloomberg is reporting that India is getting close to a deal with the United States. The US India are close to finalizing a long-stal trade agreement that would cut US tariffs on Indian exports to 15%. From 50%. As a part of the deal, India may reduce Russian oil imports, which is kind of what Trump was talking about last week that Modi said he would stop buying Russian oil and open access for US corn and soy meal, potentially India buying our soybeans instead of China.</p>
</details>

### Meta AI 战略调整与马斯克的未来愿景

Axios 报道称，Meta 从其人工智能部门裁减了数百个职位。据报道，Meta 得出结论，其长期的人工智能努力已变得过于官僚化，希望通过重组创建一个更敏捷的运营模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Axios is reporting that Meta has cut several hundred units from its AI division. Meta reportedly concluded that its long-standing AI efforts have become overly bureaucratic in hopes that reorganization will create a more fragile or agile operation.</p>
</details>

这对我来说很有趣，因为 Meta 一直在招聘这些员工，并花费数十亿美元进行人工智能研究。他们今天居然裁员了，我猜 Meta 只是意识到他们不再需要那么多之前雇佣的人了。这确实让我对 Meta 的财报有点担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, this was really interesting to me because Meta has been the one that's been hiring all these workers and spending billions and billions of dollars on AI research. And the fact that they actually cut workers today, I was like, "Oh, I guess Meta is just realizing they don't need as many of the people they hire now. They're probably not getting rid of the people that paid a couple hundred million dollars to, but they are probably getting rid of a lot of the middle management." And it does make me a little worried for Meta going into earnings.</p>
</details>

我觉得扎克伯格一直在疯狂花钱。我觉得除了将人工智能融入广告之外，Meta 并没有一个明确的人工智能计划。Llama 模型没有真正火起来，类似 Sora 的 Vibes 应用也不是人们关心的东西。他疯狂花钱招揽人工智能人才，但我们并不确切知道他们将如何利用这些人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I feel like Zuck's been spending like crazy. I feel like Meta doesn't really have an AI plan outside of incorporating AI into the advertising. Llama has not really taken off. The Vibes app, the Sora sort of copycat is not really something that I think people care about. uh and he's spending money like crazy getting all this AI talent and we don't exactly know what they're going to do with the AI talent.</p>

你没有像 Gemini 那样大规模增长并融入整个谷歌生态系统的产品，让你能看到谷歌在人工智能方面所做事情的影响。他们只是广告效果变好了，这很好，他们靠广告赚了很多钱，但这可能不是那种能证明他们所有资本支出合理性的革命性人工智能。

<p class="english-text">You don't have a product like Gemini that's growing massively and integrating in terms of the entire ecosystem of Google where you can see the implications of what Google's doing with their AI. It's just their ads are getting better, which is fine. They make a lot of money off ads, but uh you know it it might not be the most revolutionary form of AI that is justifying all the capex that they're spending on.</p>

另一方面，伊隆·马斯克昨天发表了有趣的言论。在《纽约时报》报道亚马逊计划用实体机器人取代60万名员工后，马斯克表示：“人工智能和机器人将取代旧工作。工作将成为可选项，就像自己种蔬菜而不是从商店购买一样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of AI, here's what Elon said yesterday. Uh quite fascinating. So Jason Calcanis said, "Amazon is definitely going to replace older employees." The New York Times put out a report yesterday that we talked about that Amazon is looking to replace 600,000 employees over the next couple years uh with physical robots. Elon said AI and robots will replace old jobs. working will be optional like growing your own vegetables instead of buying them from the store.</p>
</details>

我的问题是，马斯克是在极度乐观地认为工作将成为过去式，财富将极大丰富以至于人们无需工作也能赚钱吗？还是他只是随口说说？我认为这很有趣，因为我们即将迎来特斯拉的财报，而特斯拉股价的变动通常取决于马斯克在电话会议上对未来的展望，而不是财报结果本身。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So here's my question to everybody. Uh is Elon being hyper optimistic right now by taking this approach that working will be optional implying that you know jobs will be a thing of the past and there will be so much abundance that people will be able to make money outside of needing to work or is he you know does does he have no idea what he's talking about here and he's is he just saying this to say this and the reason I think it's also interesting is because we're getting into Tesla earnings right and so the way Tesla really moves on earnings is usually during the call not during ing the results when Elon talks about the future of Tesla and the future of what they're going to be doing with AI.</p>

有人问，未来十年是否会实现**全民基本收入**（Universal Basic Income, UBI: 指政府向所有公民定期无条件支付一笔固定收入的制度）？我觉得在某种程度上，政府要么必须以 UBI 的形式补贴失业，要么就必须对这些机器人公司征收重税，因为它们的利润率会非常高。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Do you see UBI in the next decade? I mean, I feel like to some extent the government's going to have to either subsidize the lack of jobs in uh a form of UBI or they're going to have to tax the crap out of these robot companies because they're going to have margins that are just so juicy that like they're going to need a way to pay for a lot of this uh lack of work that's going to be taking place.</p>

### 财报亮点：多个行业展现强劲势头

除了 Netflix，今天还有很多公司公布了财报，而且表现都相当不错。首先，数据中心相关公司 Vertiv 业绩出色，每股收益超出预期25%，营收也超出预期。其股价上涨了5.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get into earnings. So, we had a bunch of earnings today outside of Netflix. First of all, Verdive crushed it. Verive is an important company when it comes to data centers. Take a look at their EPS. They beat by 25% on EPS. 125 versus 99 cents. Massive beat. And then 267 versus 259 on revenue. That's about a $400 million beat on Rev. Verdive is up 5.5%.</p>
</details>

接着，赛默飞世尔（Thermo Fisher）每股收益超出预期5%，营收超出预期2%。希尔顿酒店也表现不俗，每股收益和营收均超出预期，显示出消费者仍在旅行。波士顿科学（Boston Scientific）同样超出预期，每股收益同比增长19%，营收同比增长20%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you had Thermal Fisher beat by 5% on EPS 579 11.12 billion versus 10.9 on revenue. They beat by 2%. Then you have Hilton Hotels. This is the consumer. Are people actually traveling? Yeah. 211 versus 205, they beat by 3%. 3.12 versus 3.01, they beat by 4% on revenue. Boston Scientific 75 cents versus 71 cents. That's a beat by 6%. 5 billion versus 4.9 billion revenue beat by 2%. EPS up 19% year-over-year revenue is up 20% yearover-year.</p>
</details>

我们看到，无论是消费品公司、半导体公司还是GPU散热公司，各行各业的公司都在公布超预期的财报。目前，标普500指数中已有60家公司公布财报，其中85%的公司业绩超出预期至少8%。这与第二季度的结果非常相似，强劲的财报为牛市提供了支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're just seeing tons and tons of diversity, whether it's consumer companies, semiconductor companies, GPU cooling companies, all these different names that are beating earnings. So far. 85% of them have beat earnings by at least 8%. So very similar to Q2 results. You are getting earnings beats and you are getting pretty strong earnings beats across the board which is really helping out to make the bull case that the market deserves its premium.</p>

### 市场情绪波动与“Meme股”狂热再现

让我们再深入分析一下 Beyond Meat 的情况。Citadel 是做空 Beyond Meat 的主要公司之一。因此，很多散户投资者认为这可能是2021年 GameStop 事件的重演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, here is the story on Beyond Me to give a little bit more of analysis on it. Citadel is one of the main companies that's shorting uh uh Beyond Meat. And as a result, you're getting a lot of retail investors that are thinking, "Hey, maybe this is a GameStop situation from 2021."</p>
</details>

如果这真的是另一次 GameStop 事件，人们感到厌倦，而像 Oklo 这样的股票不再吸引人，他们可能会涌入 Beyond Meat，这可能会对对冲基金造成**空头挤压**（Short Squeeze: 指股价快速上涨，迫使做空者买入股票以平仓，从而进一步推高股价的现象）。当然，它是否有真正的动力来维持这种估值，我不知道，但这可能是我们会看到的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reason I think this is important to take a look on is that if this is another GameStop situation, I'm not saying anyone should jump in here because I think it's just too risky and you know I I wouldn't jump in here either. But if it feels like GameStop in 2021 and people are bored and the Oaklows of the world are not exciting anymore to a lot of people, they might just pile into Beyond Meat and that is something that could potentially squeeze the hedge funds. Now again, does it have any real momentum to be able to sustain the test of time and like actually turn into a stock that deserves this valuation? I don't know, but that could be something that we see if this continues to play out.</p>
</details>

此外，Beyond Meat 还有一个债务注销的故事，并且他们计划将流通股从5亿股增加到30亿股。股东们将在11月19日对此进行投票。如果他们将流通股增加6倍，那将是大量的股票投放市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a debt cancellation story on Beyond Meat as well. Yes, that is true in terms of them exercising and getting rid of some of the warrants, which is a fair point. Uh, they are also going to be increasing the shares outstanding from 500 million to three billion. If you actually look on the 8K and the proposal that shareholders have to vote on, they are trying to increase the share count massively in order to be able to withstand additional share issuances of common stock. So this was uh this is going to be voted on November 19th, 2025. If they increase the outstanding shares by 6x 500 million to three billion, I mean obviously that would be a lot of shares that would be out there as well.</p>
</details>

### 盘中剧烈震荡与后市展望

今天市场波动非常剧烈。开盘后不久，市场出现了一波快速下跌，许多股票，尤其是高动量股，跌幅显著。例如，Oklo 一度下跌15%，D-Wave 下跌12%，而像 Nvidia 和 AMD 这样的大盘股也未能幸免。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Oaklo loses 130. Guys, everything's sliding right here. Everything sliding. S&P goes red. Nvidia goes red. Nebius was just at 108. Back down to 103. Is there a headline? I don't know if there's a headline or it's just ALOS. That was quick, right? You had a lot of volume potentially just come in. This might be way more ALOS. I don't see anything fundamental here, but everything kind of just got hit, including those high momentum names.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，在这波抛售中，Beyond Meat、Krispy Kreme 和 GoPro 等所谓的“Meme股”却逆势上涨，显示出市场资金的奇特流向。这似乎表明，一小部分被选中的Meme股成为了当天的避风港，而其他所有资产都遭到了抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is kind of stupid, dude. This also it's it's hard to rationalize because all the momentum stocks like the Oakloss, Quantum names, they're all getting hit. But then you would think Beyond Meat and Pelaton would get hit. Those are green. But then you have the important companies like Nvidia, Amazon getting hit, but Beyond Meat's going green. So, like if everything's getting hit, you would think the momentum stocks get hit pretty bad, which they are. But then Beyond Meat and Pelaton are not. Crispy Cream is still up 26%. It's almost like a select few meme stocks got chosen to be the safe havens today. And then everything else just gets hit.</p>
</details>

对于这波下跌，我找不到任何明确的基本面原因。没有关于中国、印度或政府停摆的重大新闻。这很可能只是算法交易在周三制造的波动。十月份通常波动较大，昨天市场大幅上涨，今天则有所回吐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, why? There's no reason why. Nothing I can point to that. Which kind of is bullish because if there's no reason then it's just alos having fun on a Wednesday doing whatever they do. But if there was a reason we would have a little bit more clarity. 10:30 slam. This is a bit more of an aggressive 10:30 slam than usual. It's a random Wednesday in October and alos want to have some fun. October tends to be volatile. You had a big move yesterday.</p>

展望未来，我认为有五个潜在的催化剂可能在未来两周内推动标普500指数走向7000点：需要达成中美和美印贸易协议；需要看到资金从投机性股票流向像AMD、苹果和英伟达这样的公司；需要良好的盈利增长；需要更多的地缘政治稳定以及降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you've got five different catalysts that could be happening over the next two weeks that could really set up for that 7,000 that we're looking for on the S&P. I think the way to get there is you need the China deal, you need the India deal, you need momentum to go to the direction of the AMDs and Apples and Nvidas of the world versus a lot of the the more speculative names. um you need good earnings growth and then you need a little bit more geopolitical stability along with rate cuts. If we get those catalysts, we're probably going to see a higher S&P 500 close to 7,000.</p>
</details>

今天晚些时候，我们将迎来特斯拉的财报。市场普遍预期其股价将有6%的波动。我认为，除非伊隆·马斯克在财报电话会议上宣布一些关于FSD、机器人或能源方面的重磅消息，否则很难看到股价大幅上涨，尤其是在近期股价已经大幅反弹的情况下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a 6% implied move on Tesla. So, you're either looking at the low 400s or the 480s based on if we go green or red. I don't know what the company will be able to say on electricity, energy, power, uh, deliveries, or FSD to to get this thing to really go higher. Given it's up so much from 335, I think Elon will be able to paint a story after the earnings that are out that basically says Tesla is the greatest physical AI company that's out there in the market and that theoretically could help the stock. But I really don't know what gets Tesla to move to like 450, 460. The surprise is going to have to be Elon announcing something that we don't know about FSD or robotics or energy.</p>
</details>

总而言之，今天是一个波动剧烈的交易日，市场情绪复杂。在没有明确宏观消息的情况下，算法交易似乎主导了盘中走势。投资者的焦点将很快转向特斯拉的财报，以期为大型科技股的业绩定下基调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Summary of the day is it's choppy. There is no real headline that I can give anyone for why the S&P is down .026, but then again, the S&P is only down 0.26. A lot of momentum stocks still getting hit pretty bad. Probably not the worst thing in the world for some of the names that don't have a ton of fundamentals. The other momentum stocks that are getting hit that do have fundamentals like a Nebus, like a Hood, those probably come back over time. And now we just got to see how Tesla earnings kicks off the MAG 7.</p>
