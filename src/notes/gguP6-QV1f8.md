title: Beyond Meat 股价飙升与市场动荡：解析科技股财报季与地缘政治动态
summary: 市场开盘即迎来剧烈动荡，Beyond Meat 因沃尔玛合作及高达60%的空头头寸引发了类似 GameStop 的大规模轧空行情，盘前一度暴涨近100%。与此同时，其他高动量股票（如量子计算和核能板块）却遭遇大幅回调，显示出市场可能正在发生结构性转变。科技巨头方面，Netflix 因巴西税务问题导致每股收益不及预期，而谷歌则因与 Anthropic 的潜在数十亿美元云服务协议而股价上涨。市场在为特斯拉今日的财报做准备，同时也在关注美中、美印贸易关系以及美国政府停摆等地缘政治因素。

### 开盘亮点：Beyond Meat 的疯狂飙升

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是10月22日，星期三。在盘前市场中，有一只股票上涨了大约70%。虽然原因不甚明了，但它确实涨了。很多人都知道我说的是哪一只，这可以说是今天的主要新闻之一，我们将看看它会如何发展。抱歉，不是上涨70%，现在已经上涨了98%。我说的就是 Beyond Meat。我真不明白为什么我们不能拥有一个正常的市场，为什么总有这类股票上演如此疯狂的行情，但事实就是如此。Beyond Meat 昨天的收盘价是4.45美元，而现在已经达到了7.29美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Wednesday, October 22nd. And well, we have a pre-market where one stock is up about 70%. Don't really know why, but nonetheless, it is indeed up. A lot of you guys know which one I'm talking about, and this is, I think, kind of one of the main stories of the day, and we're going to see how it plays out. Sorry, it's not up 70%. It's up 98% now. Talking about Beyond Meat. I don't know why we just can't have a normal market. I don't know why we have to have these types of stocks do what they do, but this is what they're doing. Beyond Meat, we left the market closed yesterday and this thing was $4.45. It is now $7.29.</p>
</details>

如果你看一下期权流，我们会看一些关于 Beyond Meat 的数据，这相当惊人。不仅期权交易量巨大，而且有些人在它股价只有两美元左右时就做多了。也许他们知道会有什么事情发生。Beyond Meat 在过去一周内从50美分基本上涨到了8美元，涨了16倍。我想在刚才之前，股价一度达到8.50美元左右。这就是目前的状况。所以，我选择在一旁观望。对于那些参与其中的人，你们该怎么做就怎么做。如果你必须交易它，那就去交易吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you look at the options flow, and we're going to look at some stats on Beyond Meat, it's quite incredible some of the amount of trades that are coming in in terms of the option flow, but also some of the people that went long on this thing back when it was like two bucks. Maybe they knew something was coming, but there you go. Beyond Meat has 16xed over the past week from 50 cents to eight bucks basically. I think it was at like 8.50 a little bit earlier before right now. And that's what you got going on. So look, I am watching on the sidelines from this for those who are in it. Do what you got to do. If you got to trade it, you got to trade it.</p>
</details>

昨天宣布了与沃尔玛的合作关系，我想这在某种程度上是利好消息。考虑到股价已经涨了这么多，这显然不仅仅是“某种程度”的利好。此外，该股票的空头头寸占到了60%。我认为这是 Beyond Meat 股价如此异动的另一个原因，这可能引发了一场**轧空**（Short Squeeze: 指股价快速上涨，迫使做空者买入股票以平仓，从而进一步推高股价的现象）。我们将在开盘后，当更多资金涌入这只股票以及其他股票，并且算法交易开始运行时，看看会发生什么，特别是如果散户投资者也参与进来的话。现在有一种说法是散户正试图挤压做空该股的对冲基金。所以我们会更深入地讨论这里发生的情况。但无论如何，Beyond Meat 是今天涨幅最大的股票之一，在盘前市场上涨了100%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Walmart partnership was announced yesterday and I guess that is somewhat bullish. Well, it's obviously more than somewhat bullish given the stock has run as much as it's run. It was also short at 60%. So I think that's another reason why Beyond Meat is moving the way it's moving. But nonetheless, we're going to see when the market opens when a lot more capital comes into not only this stock but a lot of other stocks and algos get in place what actually happens if retail gets in. There's a little bit of a story on retail trying to squeeze the hedge funds that are shorting it. So we'll talk more about kind of what's going on here. But nonetheless, Beyond Meat, one of the biggest runners today, is up 100% in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

### 市场动态与科技巨头财报季

除此之外，我们还有很多其他头条新闻。昨天发生了一些关于谷歌和亚马逊的事情，我们稍后会谈到。谷歌目前在盘前上涨了约2.25%。昨天特朗普也发表了很多言论，他在与一群印度领导人共同主持排灯节庆祝活动时，谈到了关于印度和俄罗斯的一些事情。我们会讨论他的一些言论及其潜在影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Outside of that, we got a bunch of other headlines. So, we had some Google, Amazon stuff that happened yesterday. We'll talk about that. Google right there, they're up about 2.25% in the pre-markets. You have a bunch of quotes from Trump yesterday. He was hosting a Dvali celebration with a bunch of Indian leaders and he said a bunch of things about India and Russia. So, we'll talk about some of those quotes and what those quotes implicate.</p>
</details>

更广泛的标普500指数表现相对平稳，距离历史高点不到1%。道琼斯指数昨天收盘略低于47000点。我们过去一周一直在讨论的主题是，一些动量股，比如 Oklo 和 D-Wave 这类公司，从它们的股价来看，已经失去了很多动力。在盘前市场，情况并没有好转多少。虽然是红色盘前，但并非深红。像 Oklo 这样的股票在盘前继续受到冲击，下跌了4%。D-Wave 也下跌了约5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The broader S&P 500 is relatively okay. It's less than 1% from all-time highs. Dow Jones was closed just below 47,000 yesterday. And the theme that we've been talking about for this past week is some of these momentum stocks like the Oklos, the D-Waves of the world, they've been losing a lot of their momentum based on just looking at their stock prices. And look, in the pre-markets, it's not that much better. Now, it's a red pre-market, but it's not a deep red pre-market. Some of those names like in Oklo continue to get hit in the pre-market, down 4%. You got a D-Wave right there that's down about 5%.</p>
</details>

所以我认为开盘后最重要的事情之一是，这些在过去一周里遭受重创的股票能否稳住。它们中很多都是从历史高点回落，这并不意味着它们会归零，但这确实意味着支撑它们达到巨大估值的动能可能在结构上正在消退。我认为今天将是非常重要的一天，因为昨天所有这些股票都下跌了10%。如果这种情况连续第二天发生，这些股票可能会出现一些问题。如果标普500指数继续走高或至少保持稳定，英伟达维持在180美元，而不是在 Oklo 暴跌30-40%的同时跌至160美元，那就意味着市场决定不再玩这些股票，而是回归到那些真正驱动市场的重要股票上。所以我们必须拭目以待。我认为今天将是观察这一趋势是否会延续或逆转的关键一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think one of the most important things when the market opens is hey can some of these stocks that have gotten eviscerated really over the past week and a lot of them are falling from all-time highs and you know it doesn't mean that they're going to zero but it does mean that a lot of the momentum that was carrying them to these massive massive valuations structurally could be dying out and I think today is going to be a really important day because yesterday all these names were down 10%. If that continues for a second day in a row, we might have some issues in these names. If the and if the S&P continues to go higher or at least stay stable, Nvidia stays at 180, Nvidia doesn't tank to 160 while Oaklo's tanking, you know, 30 40%. That means the market's deciding, oh, we are done playing with these stocks and we are going back to the important stocks that actually run the market. And so, we're going to have to see. So, I think today is going to be a really important day to see if that ends up continuing to happen or if it kind of goes the other direction.</p>
</details>

我们有很多要谈论的话题。感谢大家的到来。早上好。Beyond Meat 正在上演它的行情。请在聊天中告诉我，你是否从中赚了钱，是否交易了它，或者是否很早之前就入场了。我昨天看到很多截图，有人在五天前，也就是10月17日，以50美分的价格买入。所以确实有很多人赚了钱。他们中很多人在两三美元时就卖掉了，没想到它会涨得更高，但事实就是如此，我们现在股价高了很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about. Thank you everybody for being here. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Beyond Meat is uh doing its thing. And let me know in the chat if you made any money off this, if you traded it, if you got in a while ago. I see I saw a bunch of screenshots yesterday of people that bought in at like freaking 50 cents um on October 17th, five days ago. So, you do have a ton of people that actually made some money. A lot of them sold at like two, three bucks. They didn't think it would go that much higher, but yeah, there you go. We are now much higher.</p>
</details>

有人说他们赚了些钱。有人说所有的钱都流向了 Beyond Meat。是的，也许很多资金正在离开那些其他的动量股，转而投向了新玩具 Beyond Meat。我们将看看这种情况是否会持续下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's what we got. A couple of you couple of you saying you made some money on it. Couple of you guys saying some money. All the money going into Beyond Meat. Yeah, maybe a lot of the money is leaving those other momentum names and it's just going into the new toy which is Beyond Meat. H we're going to see if that ends up continuing to play out.</p>
</details>

好了，我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。再次早上好。我们有很多新闻，让我们开始吧。Surj，谢谢你的20美元超级留言，非常感谢。今天有马拉松政府峰会。昨天政府举行了一个大型的加密货币座谈会，我们会讨论那个座谈会的影响。他们讨论了很多关于新支付基础设施的不同问题。很多内容似乎对这个国家加密货币的未来相当利好。所以我们会谈谈这个，并做一个简报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it. Thank everybody for being here. Good morning. Good morning once again. Got a lot of stories and let's get into it. Surj, thank you for the $20 super chat. Appreciate it. Marathon government summit today. You know, the government had a big crypto panel yesterday and we'll talk about the implications of that crypto panel. There was a lot of different things they discussed in regards to new payment infrastructure. A lot of stuff that seems relatively bullish for the future of crypto in this country. And uh so we'll talk about that and we'll do a briefing on that.</p>
</details>

另外，别忘了我们昨天有 Netflix 的财报，我想我们就从这里开始，然后是今天晚些时候的特斯拉财报，我们会做一个详细的预览。我想我们会请嘉宾来开启特斯拉财报的讨论。关于 Netflix，我们先从它开始，然后再谈谈今天其他的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also uh let's not forget we had Netflix earnings yesterday which I think we'll start off with along with Tesla earnings later today which we'll do a big preview on. I think we'll be guest to kick off Tesla earnings. Um, in terms of what we have with Netflix, so let's just start off with that, then we'll get to some of the other earnings that we had today.</p>
</details>

Netflix 的季度表现不错。问题是他们与巴西当局存在税务纠纷，导致他们不得不支付6.9亿美元的罚款。结果，他们的营业利润率受到了约3%的冲击，这意味着他们的实际净收入在每股收益（EPS）方面受到了16%的冲击。所以 Netflix 的每股收益是5.87美元，而预期是6.97美元，差了16%。收入则符合预期。Netflix 在盘前市场下跌。我认为这对 Netflix 来说不是什么大问题。归根结底，Netflix 是一家卓越的公司，他们将继续执行并长期增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Netflix had a good quarter. The problem is they had a Brazilian tax dispute with some authorities, which caused a $690 million uh penalty that they had to pay. And as a result, their operating margins got hit by about 3% and that means their actual net income got hit by 16% in terms of EPS. So Netflix right there, 5.87 versus 6.97 missed by 16%. Revenue came in line with expectations. Netflix is down in the pre-market. I think this is not a real big deal for Netflix. At the end of the day, Netflix is a phenomenal company and they will continue to keep executing and continue to grow over the long term.</p>
</details>

然而，对于那些认为他们会大超预期的人来说，他们并没有做到。这是一个不错的季度，但不是一个非凡的季度。有人可能会说这甚至算不上一个很好的季度，因为当你的每股收益差了16%时，即使是像巴西税务当局这样你无法控制的事情，仍然会带来一些痛苦。不幸的是，这种痛苦正是华尔街对 Netflix 不感冒的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, for the people that thought they were going to smash earnings, they didn't, right? It was a good quarter. It was not a phenomenal quarter. One could argue it's not even a great quarter because when you miss by 16% on EPS, even if it's something that's out of your control like Brazilian tax authorities, that can still cause some pain. And unfortunately, that pain is why the street did not get excited for Netflix.</p>
</details>

我不认为这会传染给所有大型科技公司，即所谓的“Mag 7”。我认为这只是 Netflix 的个例，不幸的是，Netflix 不得不以这样的业绩开启大型科技股的财报季。我们今天还有特斯拉的财报，我希望特斯拉能有好的业绩，但我并不期待有什么惊人的表现。而且，即使我们没有从特斯拉和 Netflix 那里看到惊人的业绩，我认为这也不代表 Meta、微软、谷歌等公司不会有好的业绩。那些才是真正、真正、真正重要的。所以，只要我们看到这些股票周围有一些动力，那么我认为我们就会没事的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think this is a uh contagion with all the Mac tech all the Mac 7 companies. I think this is isolated towards Netflix and you know unfortunately it sucks that Netflix has to kick off big tech earnings with this. We do have Tesla today and you know I hope Tesla has good earnings but I'm not expecting anything massive and you know if we don't get something massive from Tesla, Netflix I don't think that's emblematic of Meta, Microsoft, Google etc. not having good earnings. Those are the ones that really, really, really matter. And so, as long as we see some momentum around those names, then I think we're going to be okay.</p>
</details>

但无论如何，这就是昨天 Netflix 的情况。是的，有人可能会说 Netflix 与其他科技公司无关。归根结底，Netflix 是一家媒体公司。它也是一家科技公司，但他们购买媒体内容，然后通过订阅服务销售这些内容。他们不是那种花费4500亿美元在**资本支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）上，试图与其他**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscalers: 指像亚马逊AWS、谷歌云和微软Azure这样提供大规模云计算服务的公司）竞争的公司。从这个角度来看，我认为这不会是太大的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But regardless, that is what you had from Netflix uh yesterday. Yeah. And you know, one can make the argument Netflix has nothing to do with the rest of tech. At the end of the day, Netflix is a media company. It is a tech company, but they buy media and they sell a subscription against that media. They are not the ones spending $450 billion on capex to try to, you know, compete with the other hyperscalers. From that perspective, I don't think it would be that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

### 谷歌、OpenAI 与市场情绪

不过，转向谷歌，谷歌在盘前市场上涨了。为什么谷歌会上涨呢？嗯，昨天盘后，这只股票一度涨到257美元，现在是255美元。昨天，当有传言称 OpenAI 将推出一款新浏览器时，谷歌股价跌至244美元。OpenAI 确实推出了那款浏览器，我们稍后会谈到。但随后在盘后，有传言称 Anthropic——这家主要使用 AWS 的公司——可能会与谷歌签订一份价值数百亿美元的云计算协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Transitioning to Google, though, uh Google is up in the pre-markets. Why is Google up in the pre-markets? Well, uh yesterday after hours, this bad boy got all the way up to 257, right now at 255. So, Google fell to 244 yesterday when there were rumors of OpenAI launching a new browser. OpenAI did launch that browser. We'll talk about it in a second. But then after hours you had anthropic rumors around, hey, Anthropic, which has largely used AWS, might end up signing a multiple tens of billions of dollar deal with Google for cloud computing.</p>
</details>

> 谷歌可能达成一项新的云服务协议，计算资源价值可能高达数百亿美元。这是根据彭博社的报道。到目前为止，亚马逊一直是其主要的基础设施提供商和最大的支持者，向该公司投资了约80亿美元。谷歌已投入约30亿美元，并支持 Anthropic 的多云战略。我联系了两家公司，但尚未收到回复。我要说的是，由于 OpenAI 的网络浏览器，谷歌股价全天都在下跌，但在盘后交易中，股价反弹走高，目前上涨超过3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Google on a new cloud deal potentially worth tens of billions of dollars in compute. That's according to Bloomberg. So far, Amazon has been its main infrastructure provider and its largest backer, investing around $8 billion into the company. Google has put in about $3 billion and has supported Anthropic's multicloud strategy. I reached out to both companies, haven't heard back yet. I will say this, Google was down all day because of that OpenAI web browser, but those shares bouncing higher in the after hours, up more than 3%, Mel. >> All right, Mac. Thank you, Mackenzie Sagalos.</p>
</details>

看，我认为这对谷歌来说实际上是相当利好的，因为归根结底，如果 Anthropic 正在考虑使其云支出多样化，那么谷歌成为受益者，而不是其竞争对手微软，这是个好消息。那么，这对亚马逊是利空吗？不完全是。亚马逊已经从 Anthropic 身上赚了很多钱。有传言称，仅今年一年，他们就向亚马逊支付了超过30亿美元的 AWS 费用。亚马逊昨天即使在服务中断后也上涨了2%，但受此 Anthropic 消息影响，仍下跌了1.2%。这对谷歌是利好，对亚马逊不是利空，但无论如何，市场会做出反应，他们会根据这个头条新闻推高谷歌，拉低亚马逊。但我认为这个新闻不至于给亚马逊带来那么大的痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, I thought that was actually pretty bullish for Google because at the end of the day, if Anthropic's thinking of diversifying their cloud revenue spend, then you know, Google being the beneficiary of that and maybe not Microsoft as much as their competitors. That is bullish. Now, is it bearish? Amazon, not really. Amazon already makes a ton of money off anthropic. I mean, there were rumors that they paid them over $3 billion in AWS just this year alone. Amazon was up 2% yesterday, even after the outage. It was down 1.2%, still down 1.2% off of this anthropic news. bullish Google, not bearish Amazon, but nonetheless, the street's going to react and, you know, they're going to take Google higher, take Amazon lower based on a that headline, but I don't think it's a headline that would necessarily cause that much pain for uh for Amazon.</p>
</details>

有人问到 OpenAI 在直播中提到了多少次谷歌。我没看直播，所以不知道。我想他们可能想多提几次谷歌，以便炫耀他们的新浏览器。关于他们的新浏览器，我真的认为这没什么大不了的。对我来说，这并不是最令人兴奋的事情。首先，它看起来像 Perplexity 的 Comet。其次，我不明白为什么 Chrome 不能做同样的事情。它只是一个在角落或侧边带有人工智能助手的网络浏览器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can we talk about how many times Catch mentioned Google during the live stream? You know, I didn't even watch the live stream, so I I don't know how many times OpenAI mentioned Google. I would imagine they probably wanted to mention Google a lot to be able to uh show off their new browser. Look, in terms of their new browser, again, I really do think it's a nothing burger. It it's it's not it's not the most exciting thing to me when you take a look at this browser. And and the the thing is, number one, it looks like Perplexity's comet. And number two, there's the browser right there. Number two, I don't know why Chrome's not going to be able to do this either. I I like all it is is a a web browser with an AI assistant on the corner or on the side.</p>
</details>

因此，当你按下“询问 Gemini”或“询问 ChatGPT”时，就是这样了。所以我认为 Chrome 应该迅速推出能够与之抗衡的东西，并向人们展示，嘿，你不需要使用这样的东西，特别是因为他们拥有分发渠道。我认为肯定会有很多人使用 Atlas，这是他们浏览器的名字。我只是不认为这对 Chrome 来说是致命的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, you know, when you press ask Gemini or ask chatbt, that's it. So, I think Chrome should like quickly come out with something that uh that rivals this and just shows you, hey, you don't need to use something like this, especially because they have the distribution. I think there will definitely be a lot of people that use Atlas, which is the name of their their browser. I just don't think it's I just don't think it's a a a death argument for for Chrome.</p>
</details>

有人说 Chrome 已经有了，但只有 Chrome Pro 有，而不是常规版。我听说 Google Pro 有，但 Chrome 本身没有。有人说常规版 Chrome 也有。这很奇怪。好吧，我觉得我应该知道这个，或者也许他们需要更好地告诉人们这个功能的存在。但一个更深度集成的 Gemini 版本在浏览器中是不可避免的。所以，OpenAI 会因此获得用户，这对他们有好处。我只是不确定这对谷歌是否构成利空。我的意思是，当这个消息宣布时，谷歌市值蒸发了千亿美元。所以，如果你在244美元时抄底了，那真是一份礼物，你从这里到256美元做了一笔不错的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chrome already has it, but Chrome Pro has it, right? Not the regular Chrome. I heard Google Pro has it, but not not Chrome in general. Some of you guys saying, "Okay, maybe I have to update to see if Chrome already has I've never seen it on Chrome." But if that's the case, then yeah, regular Chrome has it as well. That's weird. Okay, I feel like I should have known that or maybe they need to do a better job of like telling people that's there. But a more integrated version of Gemini in the browser I think is inevitable. And so like again OpenAI is going to get users from this. It's going to be good for them. I just don't know if it's a bare case for I mean Google lost a hundred billion dollars when this announcement. And so it's just like if you picked up that dip at 244. It was really a gift and you know you got a nice little trade from 256 right here is what we have on Google.</p>
</details>

### 市场结构性转变？动量股与大盘的背离

Salesforce 在盘前持平。Meta 下跌0.3%。亚马逊下跌1.2%。PayPal 下跌0.5%。苹果下跌0.5%。SMCI 下跌1%。不幸的是，以太坊和比特币一直未能获得太多动力。这里的问题是，比特币昨天涨到了114，到收盘时又跌回了108。现在又回到了108。以太坊则从4100跌回了3800。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Salesforce that's flat in the premarket. Meta that's down uh.3%. Amazon down 1.2. PayPal that's down half a percent. Apple that's down half a percent. SMCI down one. Ethereum and Bitcoin unfortunately have not been able to get a lot of momentum. The problem with Ethereum and Bitcoin right here is uh Bitcoin went up to 114 yesterday. It came all the way down to 108 by the end of the day. Now it's back at 108. Uh and then Ethereum got to 4100 right back down to 3,800.</p>
</details>

它们一度出现的上涨势头，可能得益于黄金的反弹，但现在似乎正在消退，我们稍后会谈到黄金。就好像那笔钱先是流入了加密货币，然后又离开了。这真是我见过的最奇怪的十月之一，尤其是对比特币而言。结果，所有的加密货币衍生品，无论是 Coinbase、MicroStrategy、Hood 还是 BMR，都没有得到太多青睐，因此受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a lot of the momentum that they saw for a little bit potentially based on the rally of gold dying out which we'll talk about in a second. It's almost like that money came to crypto and that money left crypto. I mean, it is one of the weirdest October I've seen for Bitcoin in particular. And as a result, all the crypto derivatives, whether it's a Coinbase, a Micro Strategy, a Hood, a BMR, BMR right there, 50.98, not getting as much love. And as a result, those are getting hit.</p>
</details>

现在，我们来谈谈黄金。黄金的表现不是很好，又下跌了1.5%。白银也下跌了1%。关于黄金，难以理解的是，尽管它曾有过大规模的反弹，但在过去两天里，其市值已经蒸发了2.5万亿美元，又下跌了8%。这是自2013年以来最大的两日跌幅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, let's talk about gold. So, gold is uh not doing the best. It's down another 1.5% as you can see right there. Silver down another 1%. The hard thing to understand about gold is that although it's had it massive rally, it has lost 2.5 trillion of market cap um over the past two days. Another 8% decline. This is the largest two-day drop since 2013.</p>
</details>

就像那些动量股，比如量子和核能领域的股票，在盘前市场并未受到青睐，有些股票下跌了0.5%，而很多这类股票现在在盘前下跌了5%。黄金也在持续下跌。我认为，作为市场参与者，很多人应该关注的最重要的事情是：黄金会复苏吗？动量股会复苏吗？我们说的动量不仅仅是指像亚马逊、谷歌这样有势头的公司，而是指那些**高贝塔**（High Beta: Beta值是衡量股票相对于整个市场波动性的指标，高Beta值意味着股票波动性远大于市场）的股票，它们没有大量的收入和盈利，但有很多叙事驱动的动能。它们会复苏吗？

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just like the momentum stocks like your quantum and nuclear names that are not really getting any love in the pre-market and you got like some stocks that are down half a percent, a lot of those stocks are down 5% right now in the pre-markets. gold continuing to go down as well. I think the biggest thing a lot of people should be watching out for just as a market participant is, hey, is gold going to recover? Are momentum stocks going to recover? And we're not just talking about momentum as in, you know, Amazon, Google that have momentum. We're talking about massive high beta names that don't really have tons and tons of revenue earnings, but have a lot of momentum carrying them on their narratives. Are they going to recover?</p>
</details>

因为如果它们不复苏，如果黄金不复苏，即使它们只是横盘整理而不是继续下跌，那也意味着这个市场正在发生一些结构性的转变。我想在未来几天里，如果你看不到这些数字有任何向上的变动，这一点会变得非常明显。但目前看来，这种情况可能正在发生，而我们最终将不得不据此进行操作。黄金目前再次下跌至4051点，下跌了51点，跌破了4000点。从心理层面来看，这也可能是很多交易者不愿看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if they don't recover and if gold doesn't recover, maybe they even go sideways even if they don't keep going down, that means there's some structural shifts happen happening in this market. And I I I think it would become pretty evident over the next coming days if you don't see any level of movement a top on those numbers. But it seems like that could be playing out right now and that's how we would ultimately have to navigate it. Gold again right here down at 4,51. It loses 51 points. It's down below 4,000. And psychologically, that could also be something that a lot of traders don't necessarily love to see.</p>

### 宏观与地缘政治动态

Applied Digital 看起来在盘前达成了一项协议。APLD 股价为33.98美元，上涨了4%。我们会看看他们达成了什么协议。我知道他们几周前也有不错的财报，这让这只股票真正动了起来。Navitas 也是如此。Applied Digital 签订了一份为期15年、价值50亿美元的租赁协议，将在北达科他州建立一个人工智能工厂。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh, Applied Digital, looks like they got a deal right here in the pre-markets. APLD 33.98 that is up 4%. Um, and so we'll see what deal they had. I know they had a good earnings a couple of weeks ago as well, which got this stock to really get a move. Same thing with Navitas. Apply Digital enters a 5 billion 15year lease agreement for an AI factory in North Dakota.</p>
</details>

好的，北达科他州。Applied Digital 签订了50亿美元、为期15年的租赁协议。我们会尝试获取更多细节。看起来他们正在与全球最大的两家超大规模云服务商合作。他们没有宣布是哪家，但他们在这个北达科他州的人工智能工厂将寻求600兆瓦的电力。越来越多的这类公司从超大规模云服务商那里获得这些交易，我认为很多在过去几周里上涨的公司，确实需要更多的交易来证明其涨势的合理性。所以 Applied Digital 展示了他们的一些交易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Okay, North Dakota. There you go. Apply Digital 5 billion 15-year lease agreement. We'll try to get some more details on it. Looks like they're working with two of the world's largest hyperscalers. They didn't announce which of the hyperscalers, 600 megawws is what they're going to be looking for in this North Dakota AI factory. again more of these companies getting these deals from the hyperscalers and I think a lot of them that have rallied over the past couple of weeks I mean they really need more deals to justify the rally and so applied digital showing some of the deals that you have right here</p>

关于俄罗斯和乌克兰，我们有一些头条新闻。我想这些是昨晚特朗普讲话时谈到的内容。《金融时报》报道称，在特朗普与普京的会晤被取消后，俄罗斯袭击了乌克兰。根据特朗普昨天对普京的言论，很多事情都暗示了这一点。他被明确问到是否想与普京会面，他回答说不，他不想浪费时间。现在看来，我们确实看到了这样做的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um Russia Ukraine all right we got some headlines there so I think this is stuff that was talked about um last night as well when Trump was speaking the Financial Times right here saying Russia strikes Ukraine after Trump Putin meeting cancelled a lot of this was hinted did yesterday based on what Trump said about Putin. He was explicitly asked if you want to meet with Putin and he said no. He doesn't want to waste his time. And well, now it looks like we're actually seeing the ramifications of that.</p>
</details>

> 我不想开一次浪费时间的会议。我不想浪费时间。所以，我会看看会发生什么。但是，我们达成了所有这些伟大的协议，伟大的和平协议。它们都是和平协议，是坚实的协议，每一个都是，但这一个不是。我说，“到前线去，到战场的前线去，然后你们撤回来，回家，大家都休息一下”，因为你有两个国家在互相残杀。两个国家每周损失五千到七千名士兵。所以，我们会看看会发生什么。我们还没有做出决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't want to have a wasted meeting. I don't want to have a waste of time. So, I'll see what happens. But, uh, we did all of these, uh, great deals, great peace deals. They're all peace deals, agreements, solid agreements, every one of them, but this one. And I said, "Go to the line. Go to the line of uh battle on the battlefield lines and you pull back and you go home and everybody take some time off because you got two countries that are killing each other. Two countries are losing 5 to 7,000 soldiers a week. So, we'll see what happens. It's we haven't made a determination."</p>
</details>

现在，俄罗斯在过去几周里一直在袭击乌克兰。所以这并不是很长时间以来的第一次袭击。我的意思是，这也是特朗普生气的部分原因，对吧？因为他们没有停止袭击乌克兰，也没有同意任何程度的停火。这是在他上周与普京通电话之后，他说那次通话在达成某种程度的谈判方面是“合理的”。这也是在与泽连斯基在椭圆形办公室会晤之后。所以即使在两次会晤之后，而且这是他今年与这两位领导人的多次会晤，特别是在六月份的阿拉斯加会议之后，仍然没有任何进展。这显示了这场冲突是多么地根深蒂固，要达成谈判是多么困难。如果他们能做到，市场可能会喜欢，但现在看来，完成这项工作并不那么容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, Russia has been striking Ukraine for the past couple weeks now. So, it's it's not like this is like the first strike in a long time. I mean, this is part of the reason why Trump is pissed off, right? is because they haven't stopped striking Ukraine and they haven't agreed to any level of a ceasefire. This is after the Putin phone call he had last week which he said you know was reasonable uh in terms of getting to some level of negotiation and this was after the Zalinsky meeting in the Oval Office. So even after both meetings and this is like multiple meetings he's had this year with both of these guys especially after the Alaska conference they had back in in June still no progress on this. I mean, it goes to show how unbelievably deep this conflict is and how hard it is to really get to a negotiation here. If they were to do it, Marcus probably would like it, but right now it doesn't look as easy to uh to get this job done.</p>
</details>

说到交易，政府停摆仍在继续。贸易代表詹姆森·格里尔早上发表了一些看法，他基本上说民主党人继续阻碍谈判。这又是迈克·约翰逊、特朗普等人每天都在重复的故事，一方指责另一方。昨天凯文·哈塞特说，也许到本周末我们能就此达成某种解决方案，但我不知道，情况看起来很严峻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of deals, government shutdown still in place. You had a trade representative Jameson Greer give some thoughts in the morning and basically he said that the Democrats continue to hold up the negotiations which again Mike Johnson and Trump and all these it's the same story every single day. One side blaming the other. Uh Kevin Hassid yesterday said maybe by the end of the uh by the end of the week we're going to get some you know some some level of resolution on this but I don't know dude it looks grim.</p>
</details>

Kaui 仍然估计停摆有可能持续到11月16日。我们现在已经进入停摆的第21天。昨天的头条新闻还有特朗普表示，在政府重新开放之前，他不会与民主党人对话。所以，如果民主党人想在政府开放前谈判以达成协议，而特朗普在政府开放后才愿意谈，那么你就有了两方僵持不下的局面。我不知道这将如何解决。目前市场对此不太关心，但我认为如果这种情况持续超过30天，而我们距离那一天还有九天，市场可能会开始关心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It looks very grim. Kaui is still estimating November 16th there is a chance for the shutdown to last. We are now 21 days into the shutdown. The headline yesterday as well was that Trump said he is not going to speak to the Democrats until the government is reopened. So, I mean, if the Democrats don't want to talk until the government until the the Democrats want to talk before the government is open to get to a deal and Trump's not willing to talk until after it's open, you got two sides that are at a standstill. And I don't know how it's going to be resolved. Again, markets don't care about it too much right now, but I think if this lasts more than 30 days, you know, and we're nine days away from that happening, markets might start to care.</p>

### 市场开盘：剧烈波动的众生相

稀土股，让我们来看看。哇，在盘前市场继续下跌。MP 下跌3.5%，TMQ 下跌7%，CRML 下跌9%，LAC 下跌3.3%，USAR 下跌5.5%。量子股方面，D-Wave 下跌6%，NQ 下跌2%。Regetti 这只股票受创相当严重，又下跌了3.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that is what you've got with Russia, Ukraine, and some of this government shutdown. The rare earth stocks, let's take a look at them. Wow. Continue to go down in the pre-market. MP down 3.5. TMQ down 7. CRML down 9. LAC down 3.3. US AR down 5.5. The quantum stocks, D-Wave, that's down 6%, and NQ that is down 2%. Regetti, this one has gotten hit pretty bad. That's down another 3.5%.</p>
</details>

核能股方面，那只股票下跌了2.4%。Oklo 下跌了5.3%。Oklo 昨天还在147美元，现在是132美元。历史最高点在193美元左右。然后是 SMR，这只股票略微持平至上涨。所以所有这些股票仍在继续受到冲击。比特币矿商转型的数据中心公司，Galaxy 昨天因为财报良好而受到一些青睐，现在下跌了4%。IN 下跌4%，Cipher 下跌5%，CleanSpark 下跌3%，Wolf 下跌1%，Hive 下跌6%，Bitfarms 下跌7%，Marathon 下跌2%，Riot 下跌2%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nanukular, that one is down 2.4. Oaklo is down 5.3. Oaklo again was at 147 yesterday. Now it's at 132. Alltime high was around 193. Uh and then SMR, this stock is slightly flat to green. So you got all those names still continuing to take a hit. The Bitcoin miners turn data centers. Galaxy got some love yesterday because of they had good earnings. That's down 4%. IN down 4%. Cipher down five. CleanSpark down three. Wolf down one. Hive down six. Bit farms down seven. Marathon down two. And Riot down two.</p>
</details>

再说一次，很多这类股票，无论是比特币矿商、区域性银行（哦不，区域性银行在过去几天财报良好后其实表现不错），还是稀土股、量子股和核能股。就在标普500指数距离历史高点仅2美元之遥的时候，这些股票在过去几周里下跌了30%到40%。我认为今天将是观察这种情况在结构上是否会持续的关键一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, a lot of these names, whether they're Bitcoin miners, regionals, or not regionals, rare earths. Regionals is actually doing pretty well after uh some good earnings that we saw over the past couple days, uh it's Bitcoin miners, rare earth stocks, quantum, and nuclear. Those are the ones right now as the S&P 500 is $2 away from alltime highs are down 30 to 40% over the past couple weeks. And I think today is going to be really important to see structurally if that one can continue.</p>
</details>

Jess 说：“基本面薄弱的投机性股票和那些零盈利的股票正遭受重创。加油，这是上涨前的最后一次洗盘。”是的，我的意思是，这些股票的股价走势是可以改变的。顺便说一下，十年期国债收益率略有上升，但仍低于4%。如果它们能拿出好的财报……理解这一切的难点在于，如果这些公司本来就没有任何盈利，它们能拿出什么样的财报呢？它们能说些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jess says, "Weak hand speculative stocks and those with zero earnings getting hit hard. Let's go. Final push before the move up." Yeah, you know, I mean, again, the thing is a lot of these names can change their stock price action. The 10-year, by the way, slightly up, but still below four. If they put up a good earnings, the the hard part about understanding all this is like if these companies don't have any earnings to begin with, what earnings are they going to put up? What could they possibly say, right?</p>
</details>

比如，如果谷歌经历了几个糟糕的月份，他们可以通过发布一份亮眼的财报来彻底改变整个叙事。但如果这些股票经历了几个糟糕的星期，而它们又没有任何盈利，它们能说些什么来……比如 Big Bear AI 能说什么？他们已经预告没有增长了。上周这只股票还接近10美元，现在是6.91美元。所有在9.50美元买入的人，他们能期待财报带来什么呢？上次电话会议他们甚至没有接受提问。Big Bear AI 没有进行问答环节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? Like if if Google's having a crappy couple months, they can put up a massive earnings and change the entire narrative. But if one of these stocks are having a crappy couple weeks and they don't have any earnings, what could they possibly say that get like what is Big Bear AI going to say that there's no growth? They already guided for no growth. The stock was almost $10 last week. Now it's at 691. All the people that bought at 950, like what can they look forward to on earnings? And so I think the I mean they didn't even take questions last time on their call. Big Bear AI did not take Q&A. They didn't take any questions.</p>
</details>

所以，这将是一个非常有趣的观察点：资金会回到这些股票上，还是会流向像 AMD 和亚马逊这样基本面更好、存在低估机会的股票？但当你看到 Beyond Meat 的表现时，你又会开始疑惑，这里到底发生了什么？我认为这更多的是在对冲基金和散户都对其感到兴奋的背景下发生的一场轧空。但我们必须看看，这种情况究竟会如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's going to be really interesting to see, is the money going to come back to these names or is it just going to go into an AMD and Amazon undervalued opportunities that are out there that have a bit more fundamentals, but then you see Beyond Meat and you kind of wonder, all right, like what exactly is going on right here? And I think this one is more so just a squeeze in in the context of the hedge funds that are getting excited about it with retail. But we're going to have to see, you know, where exactly this ends up playing out.</p>

### 监管视角与未来展望

</details>

> 问：当你们看到像这样疯狂的波动时，你或者 SEC 会怎么想？
> 答：嗯，你知道，市场会做它该做的事。所以人们可以专注于他们想要投资的东西。我们关心的是操纵行为。所以，即使在政府停摆期间，我们在对市场进行监控时，已经停止了纳斯达克上八家有操纵行为迹象的外国公司的交易，我们称之为“拉高出货”。所以那些已经被关闭了。我们正在监控市场中表明存在猫腻（hanky panky）的行为。
> 问：所以你们现在对模因股交易回归保持高度警惕？
> 答：嗯，我认为我们正在进行正常的监控，我们有专门负责此事的人员。这是我们执法工作的一部分。

<details>

What we're concerned about is man manipulative behavior. And so here even during the shutdown as we uh conduct our surveillance of the marketplace we have uh stopped trading on eight uh foreign companies on NASDAQ that showed uh indicia of uh manipulative behavior ramp and dump we call it. Um and so those have been shut down. Uh so we are monitoring the market for um uh the behavior that indicates uh you know hanky panky going on in the marketplace. So, you're you're high are you high alert, heightened alert right now that meme trading is is back on. >> Well, I think we're we're doing our normal surveillance and and so we have uh people who are devoted to that. That's part of our law enforcement effort.</p>
</details>

这家伙根本不在乎。是的，市场里有些“猫腻”正在发生。伙计们，这是特朗普的 SEC。你可以看看他，他就像是，“哦，酷。”他根本不在乎。“市场会做它该做的事”，这是他的原话。现在，如果这是加里·根斯勒，气氛就会不同。但保罗·阿特金斯就像是，“好吧，让人们交易吧。如果他们想交易，就让他们交易。”

This is Trump's SEC. He you can look at him. He's like he's like, "Oh, cool. There's some like he doesn't care. The market's going to do what it's going to do." That is his quote. Now, if this was Gary Gendler, there would be a different vibe. But Paul Atkins is like, "Well, let people trade. If they want to trade, they want to trade."</p>

我们再回到他这里。我们确实看到整个市场正在经历一波相当难看的下跌。我肯定会被行权我的 Nebius 98美元的看跌期权。如果到周五还不反弹，我将成为股东。D-Wave 下跌10%，Netflix 下跌9.4%，特斯拉下跌2%。标普500指数失守670点。Hoodie 股价124美元，可能很快会跌至120美元区间。英伟达下跌0.5%。Oklo 下跌13%，可能失守120美元。AS 刚刚失守70美元。天哪，AS 刚刚失守70美元。SoFi 27.50美元，下跌4%。

I will be a shareholder on Friday if this doesn't bounce. 98.97 D-Wave 10% down. Netflix 9.4%. Tesla down 2%. S&P loses 670. Hoodie 124 low 120s might be coming up. Nvidia that's down half a percent. Oaklo down 13% potentially losing 120. AS just lost 70. Oh my. AS just lost 70. SoFi 27.50 that's down 4%.</p>
</details>

现在，让我们听听瑞银（UBS）对当前市场状况的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's uh what UBS has to say about the state of the markets that we're in right now.</p>
</details>

> 生产力、政策都趋于一致，我认为我们将看到这种情况继续向前发展。我认为还有一些顺风因素可能有助于我们，比如利率下降。你已经看到了美联储的转变，鲍威尔的暂停转向。你已经看到了一种理解，即利率将会下降，我认为这可能会……我们瑞银认为，这将有助于市场向前发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> 100 isn't a coincidence. I think you have an alignment of um productivity, an alignment of policy, and I think that we see that continuing to go forward. I think that you also have some tailwinds that could help us out with interest rates coming down. And what you've seen from the Fed and you've seen this this pivot by the Fed, the pal pus pivot. Um you've seen a pivot to an understanding that interest rates are going to come down and I think that that could be and and we at UBS feel that that could be something that will help the market going forward.</p>
</details>

> 你可以称之为“道奇红利”（Doge dividend）。这是对华盛顿支出观念的重塑。除此之外，你还有一位总统、一个政府、一位财政部长，他们不是跳出框框思考，而是根本没有框框。你听到财政部长谈论稳定币将成为一个两万亿美元的产业。你看到国债在《Genius Act》下被用作支持稳定币的东西。所以，这是在努力解决正在发生的财政现实。38万亿美元的赤字是本届政府不会容忍的，这无疑对市场情绪和经济产生了积极影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, you could call it the Doge dividend. It's it's been a reframe of how people think about spending in Washington. In addition to that, you have a president, an administration, a secretary of the Treasury that doesn't think out of the box, but has no box. And you hear the the the Treasury Secretary talk about stable coins being a two trillion dollar uh industry. You see treasuries being used as under the Genius Act as something that would would be backing stable coins. So there is an effort to address the fiscal realities of what's going on. A $ 38 trillion deficit is not something that this administration is going to tolerate and that certainly is having a positive impact on the uh on the animal spirits and on the economy.</p>
</details>

> 是的，我认为你在信贷市场发生的事情中看到了这种风险。你在较小的信贷债务中看到了它。但我认为，总的来说，在股票市场承担风险，并在任何回调时增加对这些股票市场的敞口，可能会是有益的。在瑞银，我们相信到今年年底，市场可能会在6700到6900点之间。到明年六月，我们可能会看到7300点。我们还有一个牛市情景，预测会达到8000点。我认为有很多因素正在发挥作用。这可能是一场完美的利好风暴，但我们必须意识到风险。你看到金价上涨，尽管今天有所波动，但你看到金价上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And I think you see that risk in what's happening in the credit markets. You see it in the smaller uh the smaller credit obligations. But I think that on balance taking a risk in the equity markets and on any pullback gain greater exposure to those equity markets could be something that would benefit. at UBS, you know, we believe that the market could be somewhere between 67 and 6,900 by the end of this year. Um, by June of next year, we could see 7,300. And we we have a bullc case scenario that says 8,000. And I think there's a lot of factors that are coming into play. It's a perfect storm of goodness that could happen, but we have to be cognizant of the risk. You see gold prices going up. I mean, notwithstanding the movement today, notwithstanding the movement today, um, you see gold prices going up.</p>
</details>

> 现在，这是一个人们购买风险保险的问题，还是人们理解到世界各地正在发生财政问题的结果？世界各地主权债务的财政溢价是我们必须注意的事情。但总而言之，在人工智能带来的生产力、较低的利率以及7万亿美元的场外资金之间，这是一个进入市场的非常积极的时期。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, is that a question of people buying a risk insurance or is that a matter of people understanding that there's fiscal issues that are going on around the world? The fiscal premiums around the world for sovereign debt are something that we have to take note of. But all in all, between the productivity that comes from artificial intelligence, between with lower interest rates and the $7 trillion on the sideline, this is a very positive time to be in the markets</p>
</details>

> 如果你看看经济中正在发生的巨大变化，拥有对科技的敞口，拥有对人工智能的敞口……长寿是每个人都在思考的问题。我生日快到了，所以我也在想这个问题。但这是我们都在关注的事情，而科技在各行各业的应用将改变许多许多事情。所以它超越了我们习惯的常规实践，因为我们现在正在发生从未发生过的事情。

### 特斯拉财报前瞻

关于特斯拉，我昨天也说过，我不知道公司在电力、能源、交付或全自动驾驶（FSD）方面能说些什么来真正推动股价走高。考虑到它已经从335美元上涨了很多，我认为埃隆·马斯克将能够在财报发布后描绘一个故事，基本上说特斯拉是市场上最伟大的实体人工智能公司，这在理论上可以帮助股价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the thing that I'm thinking for Tesla, and I said this yesterday, but I don't know what the company will be able to say on electricity, energy, power, uh, deliveries, or FSD to to get this thing to really go higher. Given it's up so much from 335, I think Elon will be able to paint a story after the earnings that are out that basically says Tesla is the greatest physical AI company that's out there in the market and that theoretically could help the stock.</p>
</details>

当然，如果股价在330美元，这将是另一个问题，但股价远高于330美元，而且大多数人可能都没想到它会触及400美元区间，因为它在300美元低位徘徊了很久。而且它没有盈利增长来支撑上涨。所以，这纯粹是由于万亿美元薪酬方案、XAI股权以及埃隆·马斯克购买十亿美元股票所带来的兴奋情绪。我只是认为他们需要一个不破坏任何势头的季度。只要做到这一点，我认为特斯拉就能保持强势，至少能守住420美元区间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, if the stock was at 330, this would be a different question, but the stock is up way above 330 and most people did probably didn't think it would even touch the 400s given how much it was stuck in the low 300s. And there's no earnings growth for it to go up. So, it's just pure excitement on the trillion dollar pay package and the XAI equity stake and El Elon buying a billion dollars of stock. I just think they need to have a quarter that doesn't mess up any of their momentum. And as long as that happens, I think Tesla stays strong and at least it holds the 420s, you could say.</p>
</details>

但我真的不知道有什么能让特斯拉涨到450、460美元。我看到的问题是，关于自动驾驶出租车（robo taxi）的新闻，所有这些他们可能发布的头条新闻，无论是 Optimus 机器人、自动驾驶出租车还是其他任何东西，我认为都无法改变盈利前景的动态，所以这将是旧的叙事。那么问题就变成了，这个叙事是否足够好？有时候叙事是足够好的，但那是在股价处于低谷时。特斯拉并不在低谷，它曾经在，但在埃隆购买股票和薪酬方案出台后，股价从低点上涨了很多。今年迄今为止，股价上涨了15%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I really don't know what gets Tesla to move to like 450, 460. I see the problem with robo taxi news all these headlines that they could put out whether it's optimist robo taxi any of this stuff none of this I think is going to change the dynamics of the earnings picture so it would be old narrative so then the question becomes is the narrative good enough and it's like yeah sometimes the narrative is good enough but the narrative is good enough when the stock's in the gutter Tesla's not in the gutter it was in the gutter but then after Elon bought shares and that pay package came out stock's up a lot from the lows I mean the stock was at 240 on the lows it's at 435 year to date it's up 15%.</p>

所以我的直觉告诉我，这对股价来说不会是一个有趣的季度。我绝对不会去赌它，比如做财报赌博，但也许他们会宣布一些事情。他们不会回购股票，你知道，他们有380亿美元的现金，但华尔街已经知道了很多数字。所以数字不可能是惊喜。惊喜将不得不来自于埃隆宣布一些我们不知道的关于 FSD、机器人技术、能源或者比如能源需求正在疯狂增长的事情。比如我们刚和英伟达签订了一份合同，为多米尼加共和国的一批数据中心供电，而特斯拉将成为电池组供应商，诸如此类的事情，也许吧。但除此之外，我真的不知道对特斯拉能有什么期待。

<p class="english-text">So, my gut tells me it's not going to be a a fun quarter for the stock. Uh, and I definitely wouldn't bet on it like or like take an earnings gamble, but maybe they announce something. I mean, they're not buying back their stock. You know, they have 38 billion in cash, but like the street already knows a lot of the numbers. It's like the numbers can't be the surprise. The surprise is going to have to be Elon announcing something that we don't know about FSD or robotics or energy or like energy demand is going insane. We just signed a contract with Nvidia to power a bunch of data centers in the Dominican Republic and Tesla's going to be the battery pack that like you know something like that maybe. But outside of that announcement, I I just don't know what to expect for Tesla.</p>
