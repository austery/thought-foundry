### 开场：生死的哲学辩论

True or false? You, Brian Johnson, the man sitting across from me, one day, at some point, as of yet undefined in the future, you will die.

主持人：对或错？布莱恩·约翰逊，坐在我对面的你，有一天，在未来某个尚未确定的时刻，你会死去。

False.

Bryan Johnson: 错。

Sold Venmo for $800 million. Has spent a fortune on a quest to stay young forever.

旁白：他以8亿美元出售了Venmo。为了永远保持年轻，他花费了巨额财富。

Don't die is the general theme of what we're trying to do. It's humanity's only objective. None of us live forever except Brian Johnson.

旁白：不死亡是我们努力的总体主题。这是人类的唯一目标。除了布莱恩·约翰逊，我们没有人能永生。

Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Brian Johnson.

主持人：女士们先生们，请欢迎布莱恩·约翰逊。

### 平衡测试：揭示你的生物年龄

Hi guys. Okay, everybody stand up. What you're going to do is choose your left or your right foot.

大家好。好的，请大家站起来。现在你们要做的，是选择你们的左脚或右脚。

I'm going to count down from three, and you're going to stay standing on your selected foot as long as you can with your eyes closed. Hands by your side; they can't be out wide, they need to be close by. Your foot also needs to be somewhere close by, not extended far out. Just choose your right or left foot.

我会从三开始倒数，然后你们要闭上眼睛，尽可能长时间地单脚站立。手放在身体两侧，不能张开，要靠近身体。你们的另一只脚也要靠近，不能伸得太远。好的，现在选择你们的右脚或左脚。

And those of you on the balcony, be careful.

阳台上的各位，请小心。

If somebody fell off, that'd be a bad situation. Okay, foot selected. Let me pull out my timer, and I'm going to count the number of seconds that pass.

如果有人掉下去，那可就糟了。好的，脚选好了。我拿出计时器，我会数过去多少秒。

Okay. Ready? 3, 2, 1. Close your eyes.

好的。准备好了吗？3、2、1。闭上眼睛。

5 seconds.

5秒。

10 seconds.

10秒。

And your foot can't move. Keep it stationary.

你们的脚不能动，要保持静止。

15 seconds.

15秒。

20 seconds. Okay, we'll stop there. Who's still up?

20秒。好了，我们停在这里。还有谁站着？

Okay, good. We'll do it one more time. No, no, stay up. This is a **biological age** (Biological Age: an indicator of the body's physiological age, which may differ from chronological age) test.

好的，很好。我们再来一次。不，不，继续站着。这是一个**生物年龄**（Biological Age: 衡量身体生理年龄的指标，可能与实际年龄不同）测试。

As you age, the part of your brain that keeps you well-balanced atrophies, and you can't maintain balance very well.

随着年龄增长，大脑中负责保持平衡的部分会萎缩，你们就很难保持平衡。

So, kids are very good at this; as you age, you get worse. If you can stand between 15 and 30 seconds, that's roughly equivalent to being 20 to 40 years old.

所以，孩子们很擅长这个；随着年龄增长，你们会变得越来越差。如果你们能坚持15到30秒，那大致相当于20到40岁。

If you can stand for 7 to 15 seconds, you're between 40 and 60. And 0 to 7 seconds, you're in the 60-plus age category. Okay.

坚持7到15秒的，年龄在40到60岁之间。而0到7秒的，则属于60岁以上这个年龄段。好的。

Yep. All right. Ready? Okay, you can choose again. Right or left foot? Your foot has to be stationary; you can't move it around. Arms close by. Okay.

好的，准备好了吗？你们可以再选一次。右脚还是左脚？你们的脚必须保持静止，不能四处移动。手臂靠近身体。好的。

Three, two, one, go.

三、二、一，开始。

Five seconds.

5秒。

10 seconds.

10秒。

15 seconds.

15秒。

20 seconds. Try to make it to 30, everyone. 10 more seconds.

20秒。大家争取到30秒。还有10秒。

30 seconds. Okay, cool. Good job, everyone. All right, you can take a seat.

30秒。好的，太棒了。各位干得好。好了，大家可以坐下了。

### 器官的生物年龄：身体的秘密

The neat thing about **biological age testing** (Biological Age Testing: methods used to determine the physiological age of an individual's body, which may differ from their chronological age) is that you, of course, know when you were born and therefore know how many years you've lived.

**生物年龄测试**（Biological Age Testing: 用于确定个体身体生理年龄的方法，可能与其实际年龄不同）的巧妙之处在于，你当然知道自己何时出生，因此也知道自己活了多少年。

You can look at yourself in the mirror and say, 'I have a few wrinkles or a few spots.'

你可以照镜子，然后说：“看，我有一些皱纹或斑点。”

But actually, within your body, your organs have different ages.

但实际上，在你体内，你的各个器官有着不同的年龄。

So, your lungs are a certain age, as are your brain, your eyes, your ears, your gums, your pancreas, and your liver; they're all different biological ages.

所以，你的肺有特定的年龄，你的大脑、眼睛、耳朵、牙龈、胰腺、肝脏，它们都有不同的生物年龄。

And it's really important to know. For example, I'm 47, but my left ear is 64 years old.

了解这一点非常重要。例如，我今年47岁，但我的左耳已经64岁了。

It's because I shot a lot of guns as a kid. I was right-handed, holding the gun like this, with a lot of exposure to loud noise in my ear.

这是因为我小时候经常射击。我是右撇子，这样持枪，所以我的左耳暴露在很大的噪音中。

And I also listened to a lot of loud music. So that's really important for me to know, because when you have hearing loss and you don't correct for it with a hearing aid, it can result in **cognitive decline** (Cognitive Decline: a reduction in cognitive abilities, such as memory, thinking, and reasoning).

我听了很多大声的音乐。所以这对我来说非常重要，因为当你出现听力损失而没有使用助听器进行矫正时，这会导致**认知能力下降**（Cognitive Decline: 记忆、思维和推理等认知能力的减退）。

This applies to all aspects of health, including the heart. A couple of years ago, I posed this question: 'Are we really the first generation who won't die?'

这适用于所有与心脏相关的健康问题。几年前，我提出了这个问题：“我们真的是不会死亡的第一代人吗？”

It's arguably the coolest question in existence. What matters more than our experience, our ability to live?

这可以说是世上最酷的问题。有什么比我们的经验、我们生存的能力更重要呢？

### 逆转衰老的实验与“健康运动”

To explore this, I wanted to do an experiment. So, we measured the biological age of every organ in my body as comprehensively as possible.

为了探究这个问题，我想进行一项实验。于是，我们尽可能全面地测量了我身体每个器官的生物年龄。

We then went through the scientific evidence and tried to reverse and/or slow down my speed of aging.

随后，我们查阅了科学证据，并尝试逆转或减缓我的衰老速度。

What I've been trying to do is create a sport or a new genre that redefines what it means to be healthy.

我一直致力于创造一种运动或一种新的类型，来重新定义健康的意义。

So, I published my **biomarkers** (Biomarkers: measurable indicators of biological states, such as health or disease) and essentially declared that I have the best biomarkers of anybody in the world.

于是，我公布了我的**生物标志物**（Biomarkers: 可测量的生物状态指标，如健康或疾病），并基本上宣称我拥有世界上最好的生物标志物。

Anyone willing and capable can compete with me. The goal is to make it a quantified thing, where it's not just 'I'm healthy or not.'

任何愿意且有能力的人都可以与我竞争。目标是使其成为一个可量化的事情，而不仅仅是“我健康与否”。

And so it's been a really fun journey. Today, in just a few minutes, I'm going to tell you everything I've learned about health.

这真是一段非常有趣的旅程。今天，在短短几分钟内，我将告诉大家我所学到的所有关于健康的知识。

I'm going to compress it into some very simple lessons for you, because health is really complicated, very confusing, all-consuming, and overwhelming.

我会将其压缩成一些非常简单的课程，因为健康确实很复杂、令人困惑、耗费精力且让人不知所措。

### 健康核心：优化睡前静息心率

So first, who got eight hours of sleep last night?

那么首先，昨晚有谁睡足了八小时？

Okay, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Thank you for your honesty. Two. There. Thank you, sir. One. Yeah, I appreciate that. Okay, who has a confession to make?

好的，7、6、5、4、3。感谢你们的诚实。2。还有。谢谢你，先生。1。是的，我很感谢。好的，谁有事情要坦白？

Who recently polished off a bag of chips, ate some ice cream, and then jammed some Twizzlers? What did you do, sir?

谁最近吃完了一整包薯片，又吃了冰淇淋，然后又塞了一些Twizzlers（一种螺旋形糖果）？先生，你做了什么？

Audience Member: Chips. A whole bag. One sitting.

观众：薯片。一整包。一次性吃完。

All right. Great. Who else? What did you do? Gelato.

好的。很棒。还有谁？你做了什么？冰淇淋。

Audience Member: Gelato.

观众：冰淇淋。

Yeah, I get it. Okay, cool.

嗯，我懂了。好的。

Okay, so, everyone, the single best thing I've learned out of everything I've ever done is that your **resting heart rate** (Resting Heart Rate: the number of times your heart beats per minute while at rest) before sleep is the best thing you can do for your health, hands down.

好的，各位，我所做的一切事情中，学到的最好的一点就是，你们睡前的**静息心率**（Resting Heart Rate: 在休息状态下，心脏每分钟跳动的次数）是你们能为健康做的最好的事情，毫无疑问。

Okay, so here's what you're going to do tonight. Before you go to bed, you're going to get a baseline reading.

好的，所以今晚你们要做的是：睡觉前，先测量一个基线读数。

You can use a wearable device or simply place your fingers on your neck to measure it. You're going to lie down on your bed, take a few deep breaths.

你们可以使用可穿戴设备，或者只是用手指按在脖子上测量。你们要躺在床上，做几次深呼吸。

You're going to find your resting heart rate. Let's say it's 60 beats per minute.

你们会找到自己的静息心率。假设是每分钟60次。

Okay, your goal over the next month is to lower your heart rate by about 10%.

好的，你们未来一个月的 H 目标是将心率降低约10%。

So, if your current heart rate is 60, aim to get it down to 54. And here's how you're going to do it: if your bedtime is at 10 p.m., eat your final meal of the day at 6 p.m.

所以，如果你们是60，就降到54。以下是你们如何做到这一点的方法：如果你们晚上10点睡觉，那么在晚上6点吃完当天的最后一餐。

After 6 p.m., no more food, no more snacks. By doing that, you allow your body to digest your food.

晚上6点之后，就不能再吃东西，不能再吃零食了。这样做，你们就能让身体充分消化食物。

And you're going to see that as you do that, your heart rate is going to go down. The reason why heart rate is so important is that the lower your heart rate is, the better your sleep.

你们会发现，这样做之后，你们的心率会下降。心率之所以如此重要，是因为心率越低，睡眠质量就越好。

The better your sleep, the better your willpower. Did you know if you don't sleep, your **prefrontal cortex** (Prefrontal Cortex: the anterior part of the frontal lobe of the brain, involved in complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior) goes offline, and you lose your willpower?

睡眠质量越好，你们的意志力就越强。你们知道吗，如果睡眠不足，你们的**前额叶皮层**（Prefrontal Cortex: 大脑额叶的前部，参与复杂的认知行为、人格表达、决策制定和社会行为的调节）就会“下线”，你们就会失去意志力。

So when you're trying not to eat the cookie, you're powerless. You can't do it; it's gone.

所以当你们试图不吃饼干时，你们会感到无力。你们做不到，意志力已经消失了。

So sleep is the best performance-enhancing drug in the whole world. It's the thing you want to do every night.

所以，睡眠是全世界最好的提高表现的“药物”。这是你们每晚都想做的事情。

### 改善睡眠的四大策略

So the first thing is to eat your final meal 4 hours before bed. Number two is you need to turn your screens off an hour before bed.

所以第一点是，睡前四小时吃完最后一餐。第二点是，睡前一小时关闭所有屏幕。

Now, I realize that's hard; we are all addicted to our phones. But that one hour is so important because you have to give your body the ability to wind down.

现在我知道这很难；我们都沉迷于手机，但这一个小时非常重要，因为你们必须让身体有能力放松下来。

And if you're scrolling or working, you're going to be in a roused state, which boosts your heart rate.

如果你们还在刷手机或工作，你们就会处于一种兴奋状态，这会提高你们的心率。

Anything that boosts your heart rate before bed is going to be bad for you. Third, you want to have amber and red lights in your house.

任何在睡前提高心率的事情，对你们都是不利的。第三点是，你们家里应该使用琥珀色和红色的灯光。

No blue lights, as these (referring to the stage lights) are very blue. You also want to be mindful of your **stimulants** (Stimulants: substances that temporarily increase alertness, attention, and energy levels).

不要用蓝光，就像这些灯光就很蓝。你们还需要注意**兴奋剂**（Stimulants: 能够暂时提高警觉性、注意力和能量水平的物质）。

So around noon is when you want to stop your **caffeine intake** (Caffeine Intake: the consumption of caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant, typically found in coffee, tea, and energy drinks), because caffeine has roughly a 6-hour half-life.

所以，中午左右是你们应该停止**咖啡因摄入**（Caffeine Intake: 摄入咖啡因，一种中枢神经系统兴奋剂，通常存在于咖啡、茶和能量饮料中）的时间，因为咖啡因大约有6小时的半衰期。

So if you have a cup of coffee at 4 p.m., by bedtime, half a cup of coffee is still in your system.

所以，如果你下午4点喝一杯咖啡，到睡觉时，你体内仍有半杯咖啡的量。

And then finally, you want to have some kind of wind-down routine where you read a book, go for a walk, do breath work, or meditate—something to calm yourself down.

最后，你们应该有一个某种形式的放松习惯，比如读一本书、散步、做呼吸练习或冥想，总之是能让自己平静下来的事情。

### 睡眠与心理健康：挑战“拼命工作”文化

Okay, now just be sober with me for a minute.

好的，现在请大家和我一起清醒一下。

I promise you, this is the single best thing you can do for your health.

我向你们保证，这是你们能为自己的健康做的最好的一件事。

And if we're honest, the majority of you in this room have some moderate to serious mental health problem.

如果我们坦诚相待，这个房间里的大多数人都有中度到严重的心理健康问题。

Tell me I'm wrong.

告诉我，我错了吗？

I'm waiting. It's true. If you sample your friends, you'll see it's a pretty tough environment right now.

我在等着。这是真的。如果你问问你的朋友，你会发现现在是一个相当艰难的环境。

We are on our phones all the time. We don't sleep well. We eat junk food. It's very hard to take a moment for ourselves to be healthy.

我们总是拿着手机。我们睡不好。我们吃垃圾食品。我们很难抽出时间让自己保持健康。

I promise you, optimize your resting heart rate, and it's going to be the very best thing you do for your mood.

我向你们保证，优化你们的静息心率，这将是你们为改善情绪所做的最好的事情。

If you're experiencing anxiety or depression or having some other kind of difficulty, I'm telling you, high-quality sleep is the key.

如果你们正在经历焦虑或抑郁，或者有其他类型的困难，我告诉你们，高质量的睡眠是关键。

And the culture that tells us right now that you have to 'grind' and not sleep is a lie.

而现在告诉我们必须“拼命工作”而不能睡觉的文化，是一个谎言。

It's a bad deal for you. You can be ambitious. You can have unhinged ideas about the world and still sleep.

这对你们来说是一个糟糕的交易。你们可以有雄心壮志。你们可以对世界抱有狂野的想法，同时仍然能够获得充足的睡眠。

Okay. So, I've got 20 seconds left. Who's going to commit to this?

好的。我还有20秒。谁会承诺做到这一点？

Audience: Yep.

观众：是的。

Who's not?

谁不会？

So, I can shame you. Okay, why? Why are you not going to commit?

这样我可以让你们感到羞愧。好的。为什么？你为什么不承诺？

Startup Founder: I'm a startup founder.

创业公司创始人：我是一名创业公司创始人。

Okay, there we go. This is it, everyone. Yes, you're a startup founder.

好的，就是这样。各位，就是这个了。是的，你是一名创业公司创始人。

The narrative is you have to martyr yourself, literally martyr yourself, to achieve success.

现在普遍的说法是，你必须牺牲自己，真正地牺牲自己才能取得成功。

That is not true. You will be a better founder/parent/partner/whatever if you prioritize your sleep.

那不是真的。如果你优先考虑睡眠，你会成为一个更好的创始人/父母/伴侣/或其他任何角色。

I'm telling you, it is a false idea. Don't fall for it.

我告诉你们，那是一个错误的观念。不要上当。

### “不死亡”：人类的下一个主要思想体系

'Don't die.' Yes, it's about health. It's also the next major ideology for the human race.

“不要死亡。”是的，这关乎健康。它也是人类的下一个主要思想体系。

We are giving birth to **super intelligence** (Super Intelligence: hypothetical intellect that is vastly more intelligent than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills).

我们正在孕育**超级智能**（Super Intelligence: 假设的智能，在几乎所有领域，包括科学创造力、普遍智慧和社交技能方面，都比最优秀的人类大脑智能得多）。

Our ideas about reality are going to shift. Existence itself will be the highest virtue.

我们对现实的看法将会改变。存在本身将成为最高的德行。

'Don't die' is the next major ideology on par with democracy, capitalism, Christianity, Islam.

“不要死亡”是下一个与民主、资本主义、基督教、伊斯兰教并驾齐驱的主要思想体系。

It is the next thing we do as a species. So friends, be well. Go to bed on time. Am I seeing this? You committed? All right, guys, be well.

这是我们作为一个物种接下来要做的事情。所以朋友们，祝你们健康。按时睡觉。我看到了吗？你们承诺了吗？好的，各位，祝你们健康。
