### 特朗普政府的委内瑞拉军事与情报行动

From the New York Times, it's The Daily headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, October 16th. Here's what we're covering.

这里是《纽约时报》的每日头条。我是特蕾西·芒福德。今天是10月16日，星期四。以下是我们将要报道的内容。

>> What's the next step in this war on cartels? And are you considering options? Are you considering strikes on land?

>> 这场针对**贩毒集团** (cartels: 跨国犯罪组织，主要从事毒品贩运) 的战争下一步是什么？你们正在考虑各种方案吗？你们正在考虑对陆地进行打击吗？

>> Well, I don't want to tell you exactly, but we are certainly looking at land now because we've got the sea very well under control.

>> 嗯，我不想告诉你具体细节，但我们现在肯定正在考虑陆地行动，因为我们已经很好地控制了海上。

At the White House yesterday, President Trump said that the US is considering military strikes on Venezuela as the administration steps up its pressure campaign against the country's authoritarian leader, Nicholas Maduro.

昨天在白宫，特朗普总统表示美国正在考虑对委内瑞拉进行军事打击，因为本届政府正加紧对该国**独裁领导人** (authoritarian leader: 实行专制统治，不容忍异见的领导人) 尼古拉斯·马杜罗的施压。

In recent weeks, the US military has attacked at least five boats off the coast of Venezuela, killing 27 people.

最近几周，美国军方在委内瑞拉海岸附近袭击了至少五艘船只，造成27人死亡。

The administration has claimed, without offering evidence, that the boats were smuggling drugs to the US and has denounced Maduro as a **narco terrorist** (毒品恐怖分子: 结合毒品贩运和恐怖主义活动的罪犯)。

本届政府声称，这些船只正在向美国走私毒品，并将马杜罗谴责为毒品恐怖分子，但并未提供证据。

Yesterday, Trump said he'd also authorized the **CIA** (Central Intelligence Agency: 美国中央情报局，负责收集外国情报和执行秘密行动) to conduct covert actions in Venezuela.

昨天，特朗普表示他还授权中央情报局在委内瑞拉进行**秘密行动** (covert actions: 未公开的、秘密进行的情报或军事行动)。

>> We've had signals for a while now that the US is prepared to escalate. They've cut off diplomatic talks with Venezuela. They have brought more and more troops into the region, more and more naval ships. There's a big military buildup. And so the authorization for covert action is part of this larger march to a military and intelligence engagement in Venezuela.

>> 我们已经收到了一段时间的信号，表明美国准备升级局势。他们已经切断了与委内瑞拉的外交谈判。他们向该地区调集了越来越多的军队和海军舰艇。存在大规模的军事集结。因此，授权进行秘密行动是美国在委内瑞拉进行军事和情报介入这一更大进程的一部分。

Julian Barnes covers the CIA for The Times.

朱利安·巴恩斯负责《纽约时报》的中央情报局报道。

Julian Barnes: Privately, US officials have told us that ultimately removing Maduro from power is the goal of this campaign. It's not simply to stop the drug boats. It's not simply to get Venezuela to do more to intercept drugs coming through its country. It is about removing Maduro from power.

朱利安·巴恩斯：私下里，美国官员告诉我们，这项行动的最终目标是将马杜罗赶下台。这不仅仅是为了阻止毒品船只。也不仅仅是为了让委内瑞拉采取更多措施拦截通过其国家的毒品。其目的在于将马杜罗赶下台。

Julian says it's unknown what, if any, operations the CIA is planning in Venezuela, though the CIA's director promised during his confirmation hearing that the CIA would become more aggressive under his leadership.

朱利安表示，目前尚不清楚中央情报局在委内瑞拉计划进行哪些行动（如果有的话），尽管中央情报局局长在确认听证会上承诺，在他的领导下，中央情报局将变得更具侵略性。

In a statement, Venezuela accused Trump of trying to legitimize **regime change** (政权更迭: 通过外部干预或内部动荡改变一个国家的政府) and said it plans to raise the matter with the **UN Security Council** (United Nations Security Council: 联合国安理会，负责维护国际和平与安全的主要机构) today.

委内瑞拉在一份声明中指责特朗普试图使政权更迭合法化，并表示计划今天将此事提交联合国安理会讨论。

### 美国难民政策的潜在改革

The Times has learned that the White House is considering radically overhauling the US **refugee system** (难民系统: 接收、安置和处理寻求庇护者的机制和政策) into one that would favor white people.

《纽约时报》获悉，白宫正在考虑彻底改革美国难民系统，使其偏向白人。

For decades, the program has been aimed at helping the world's most vulnerable people, often fleeing war or other crises, whether that's in Syria, Haiti, Ukraine, Afghanistan.

几十年来，该计划一直旨在帮助世界上最脆弱的人群，他们通常是为了逃离战争或其他危机，无论是在叙利亚、海地、乌克兰还是阿富汗。

But on his first day in office, President Trump suspended all refugee admissions and asked his administration to draw up proposals for how they thought the program should run.

但在他就职的第一天，特朗普总统暂停了所有难民入境，并要求其政府起草关于他们认为该计划应如何运作的提案。

The Times got access to some of those plans, which argue that the previous refugee system made the US too diverse.

《纽约时报》获得了其中一些计划，这些计划认为之前的难民系统使美国变得过于多元化。

One proposal said the administration should only welcome refugees who can be "fully and appropriately assimilated and are aligned with the president's objectives."

其中一项提案称，政府应只接纳那些“能够完全和恰当地被同化，并与总统目标一致”的难民。

The proposals also call for Trump to prioritize Europeans who, it claims, have been targeted for speaking out against things like mass migration.

这些提案还呼吁特朗普优先考虑那些据称因反对大规模移民等问题而成为目标攻击对象的欧洲人。

Trump already offered priority refugee status to Africconers, the white minority in South Africa, claiming they face racial persecution there.

特朗普此前已经向**南非白人** (Africconers: 南非的荷兰裔白人少数民族) 提供了优先难民身份，声称他们在那里面临种族迫害。

A spokesman for the State Department would not comment on specific details in the proposals, but said this administration "unapologetically prioritizes the interests of the American people."

国务院发言人拒绝就提案中的具体细节发表评论，但表示本届政府“毫不掩饰地优先考虑美国人民的利益”。

### 五角大楼记者抗议与政府停摆下的裁员威胁

Now, two more quick updates on the Trump administration.

现在，关于特朗普政府还有两个简短的最新消息。

Yesterday at the Pentagon, a procession of reporters handed in their press passes after rejecting new rules that Defense Secretary Pete Hegsath laid out for how they can do their work.

昨天在五角大楼，一群记者在拒绝了国防部长皮特·赫格萨斯为他们工作方式制定的新规定后，交回了他们的记者证。

Several lawyers representing media organizations said the new rules violate the **First Amendment** (First Amendment: 美国宪法第一修正案，保障言论自由和新闻自由等基本权利) and that under them, reporters could have been punished for simply doing their jobs.

几位代表媒体组织的律师表示，新规定违反了《第一修正案》，并称根据这些规定，记者可能仅仅因为履行职责而受到惩罚。

The rejection was nearly unanimous among news outlets that cover the Defense Department, including The Times, NBC, and Fox News. They will no longer have physical access to the Pentagon.

包括《纽约时报》、全国广播公司（NBC）和福克斯新闻（Fox News）在内，所有报道国防部的新闻机构几乎一致拒绝了这些规定。他们将不再能进入五角大楼。

And a federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out mass layoffs during the **government shutdown** (government shutdown: 政府因预算僵局而暂停部分运作，导致非必要部门关闭和员工停薪休假).

一位联邦法官暂时阻止了特朗普政府在**政府停摆** (government shutdown: 政府因预算僵局而暂停部分运作，导致非必要部门关闭和员工停薪休假) 期间进行大规模裁员。

In her decision, the judge wrote that the White House budget office has taken advantage of the ongoing shutdown to "assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore."

在她的裁决中，法官写道，白宫预算办公室利用正在进行的停摆，“认为一切都不作数了，法律对他们不再适用”。

Unions representing federal workers had sued over the firings after the government started sending out layoff notices to more than 4,000 employees.

在政府开始向4000多名员工发出裁员通知后，代表联邦雇员的工会就这些解雇提起了诉讼。

Still, the administration does not seem phased by the judge's ruling and has threatened to fire more workers.

然而，本届政府似乎并未受到法官裁决的影响，并威胁要解雇更多工人。

>> Are we talking a thousand people?

>> 我们说的是一千人吗？

>> We're definitely talking people. We're definitely talking thousands of people.

>> 我们肯定说的是人。我们肯定说的是数千人。

The head of the White House budget office, Russell Vote, said on a podcast yesterday that the number of layoffs could more than double.

白宫预算办公室主任罗素·沃特昨天在一个播客中表示，裁员人数可能会翻倍以上。

Russell Vote: But it could grow much higher.

罗素·沃特：但它可能会高得多。

Russell Vote: It could grow higher. I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000.

罗素·沃特：它可能会更高。我想我们最终可能会超过1万人。

### 加沙地带哈马斯的行动与血腥镇压

In Gaza last night, Hamas announced that it has handed over all of the remains of Israeli hostages that it's currently able to, saying there are some it can't reach because Israeli strikes have reduced so much of Gaza to rubble.

昨晚在加沙，哈马斯宣布已交出目前能够交出的所有以色列人质遗骸，并表示有些遗骸无法找到，因为以色列的袭击已将加沙大部分地区夷为废墟。

Under the terms of the current **ceasefire** (ceasefire: 冲突双方同意暂时停止战斗的协议) between Israel and Hamas, Hamas was expected to immediately hand over more than 20 bodies of people taken captive on October 7th, 2023.

根据以色列和哈马斯之间当前**停火协议** (ceasefire: 冲突双方同意暂时停止战斗的协议) 的条款，哈马斯原应立即交出2023年10月7日被俘的20多具尸体。

At the moment, it's returned 10, saying it needs specialized equipment to recover the rest.

目前，它已归还10具，称需要专业设备才能找回其余的。

The terms of the deal acknowledged that this kind of situation was possible given the destruction in the territory, but it's not yet clear if Israel and the US will interpret Hamas's delay in returning the bodies as a violation of the peace agreement.

协议条款承认，鉴于该地区的破坏情况，这种情况是可能发生的，但目前尚不清楚以色列和美国是否会将哈马斯延迟归还遗体解读为违反和平协议。

Meanwhile, after two years of operating in the shadows, often literally underground, armed uniformed members of Hamas are now being seen on the streets in Gaza.

与此同时，在阴影中，通常是地下活动了两年之后，哈马斯身着制服的武装成员现在被发现在加沙街头活动。

The group appears to be trying to restore some semblance of public order. For example, in one city, they've been out directing traffic this week.

该组织似乎正在努力恢复一定程度的公共秩序。例如，本周在一个城市，他们一直在外面指挥交通。

Hamas also seems to be trying to show it's still the dominant force in Gaza by cracking down on small rival **militias** (militias: 非正规的武装组织，通常由平民组成) that have sprung up in the past few months.

哈马斯似乎也试图通过打击过去几个月里出现的竞争性小型民兵组织来表明它仍然是加沙的主导力量。

Israel has supported some of those groups, even providing one with weapons to fight Hamas on its behalf.

以色列支持了其中一些团体，甚至向其中一个提供了武器，代其对抗哈马斯。

Earlier this week, Hamas's crackdown led to a bloody gun battle in Gaza City.

本周早些时候，哈马斯的镇压行动导致加沙市发生了一场血腥枪战。

And later, masked fighters lined up and shot eight people in the middle of a crowded street there in what one Hamas official told The Times was an execution of its enemies.

随后，蒙面武装分子在一条拥挤的街道中央排队射杀了八人，哈马斯一名官员告诉《纽约时报》，这是对敌人的处决。

### 美国一分硬币的终结

And finally, the American **penny** (penny: 美国的一分硬币，通常由铜合金制成，印有林肯头像) is likely the most minted coin in the history of civilization.

最后，美国的**一分硬币** (penny: 美国的一分硬币，通常由铜合金制成，印有林肯头像) 可能是文明史上铸造数量最多的硬币。

Since the US started churning them out at the end of the 1700s, it has made several hundred billion of them.

自美国在18世纪末开始大量生产一分硬币以来，已经制造了几千亿枚。

That little portrait of Abraham Lincoln on the back, which obviously came later, is the most reproduced piece of art on Earth.

背面那个亚伯拉罕·林肯的小头像（显然是后来才有的）是地球上复制最多的艺术品。

As I've said before, though, the penny's time has come. The government is stopping production, citing the fact that pennies are used less and less and that each one actually costs three cents to make.

然而，正如我之前所说，一分硬币的时代已经到来。政府正在停止生产，理由是一分硬币的使用越来越少，而且每枚硬币的制造成本实际上高达三美分。

As of this fall, several **Federal Reserve** (Federal Reserve: 美国联邦储备系统，美国的中央银行) sites, which distribute coins to banks, have stopped fulfilling orders for pennies.

截至今年秋季，几个向银行分发硬币的**联邦储备系统** (Federal Reserve: 美国联邦储备系统，美国的中央银行) 网点已停止接收一分硬币的订单。

That has left stores that still do a fair amount of cash transactions in a tricky spot. How do you make change when you have no pennies?

这使得那些仍有大量现金交易的商店陷入困境。如果没有一分硬币，你如何找零？

A consortium of convenience stores and grocery stores across the country is now actually urging Congress to pass a national law rounding transactions to the nearest nickel.

全国范围内的便利店和杂货店联盟现在正在敦促国会通过一项全国性法律，将交易金额四舍五入到最接近的五分硬币。

The Midwest chain QuickTrip already rolled out its version of that plan. It's rounding all cash transactions down at its nearly 1,000 stores.

中西部连锁店QuickTrip已经推出了自己的版本。它在其近1000家门店将所有现金交易金额向下取整。

I will just say here though that when you do the math, there really should not be a penny shortage just yet.

不过，我在这里要说的是，如果你仔细计算，现在其实不应该出现一分硬币短缺的情况。

There are so, so, so many pennies still out there that even by a conservative estimate, there's $7.24 cents worth of pennies per person in the US.

目前流通的一分硬币数量非常非常多，即使保守估计，美国人均拥有的总价值也达到7.24美元。

So they're out there, just don't really know where all of them are.

所以它们就在那里，只是我们不确定它们具体都在哪里。

Those are the headlines today on The Daily.

以上是今天《The Daily》的头条新闻。

>> New Yorkers know exactly what it is that I'm running on. I'll have people stop me in the street and just shout "fast and free buses" or "universal childcare" or "freeze the rent."

>> 纽约人非常清楚我参选的纲领是什么。人们会在街上拦住我，大喊“快速免费公交”、“全民托儿”或者“冻结租金”。

>> Yeah.

>> 是的。

>> And that means that we're building a movement not around an individual, but rather around these policy commitments, and that is what we will be held to account for, and that is something that I want.

>> 这意味着我们正在建立一场运动，不是围绕个人，而是围绕这些政策承诺，我们将为此负责，这也是我想要的。

An interview with Zeron Mdani, the **Democratic socialist** (Democratic socialist: 民主社会主义者，主张通过民主方式实现社会主义目标，如社会福利和经济平等) who's running for mayor of New York City. You can listen to that in The New York Times app or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow.

这是对泽伦·姆达尼的采访，他是一位竞选纽约市市长的**民主社会主义者** (Democratic socialist: 民主社会主义者，主张通过民主方式实现社会主义目标，如社会福利和经济平等)。您可以在《纽约时报》应用程序或任何您收听播客的地方收听。我是特蕾西·芒福德。我们明天再见。
