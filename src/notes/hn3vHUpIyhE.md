### 欢迎与开场白：PT漫步者之谜

Good morning everyone. My name is Gabe. I'm a traveling car salesman. So today, I'm here to sell you the keys to this car, this beautiful vintage PT Cruiser.

大家早上好。我叫盖布。我是一名旅行汽车销售员。所以今天，我来这里是为了向你们出售这辆车的钥匙，这辆漂亮的复古**PT漫步者**（PT Cruiser：克莱斯勒公司生产的一款复古风格汽车）。

I mean, look at that faux wood side paneling. I'm told it's got turbo. Look. It's a work of art. Trust me.

我的意思是，看看那仿木的侧板。我听说它有涡轮增压。看，它就是一件艺术品。相信我。

Now, when I say that I'm selling the keys to this car, I really mean it.

现在，当我说我在卖这辆车的钥匙时，我是认真的。

I have 5,000 of these keys, and every single last one of them works to that car.

我有5000把这样的钥匙，每一把都能启动那辆车。

You click the key fob once, it unlocks the door, you click it twice, it starts the engine.

你按一下遥控钥匙，它会解锁车门；你按两下，它会启动引擎。

If you buy any one of these 5,000 keys from me, naturally you get access to the car, but so do 4,999 other people.

如果你从我这里购买这5000把钥匙中的任意一把，你自然就能使用这辆车，但同时还有4999个人也能使用。

Whatever happens beyond that is not necessarily my problem. Like I said, I'm just a car salesman.

之后发生什么就不一定是我的问题了。就像我说的，我只是个汽车销售员。

So you're probably wondering at this point, is this real? Is this guy just making this stuff up?

所以你现在可能在想，这是真的吗？这家伙是不是在编造这些东西？

Well, it is real. My name is Gabe, and I'm actually the founder of an art collective based in New York City, called Mschf. These are our logos.

嗯，这是真的。我叫盖布，我实际上是纽约市一个名为**Mschf**（Mischief的缩写，意为“恶作剧”或“淘气”）的艺术集体的创始人。这些是我们的标志。

### Mschf：一个难以定义的艺术集体

Mischief is a bit of a difficult beast to explain, and I'm not going to even try to describe it.

Mschf有点难以解释，我甚至不打算尝试描述它。

Let me give you a couple examples to help paint that picture or confuse you even further.

让我举几个例子来帮助你们描绘这幅画面，或者让你们更加困惑。

Handbags. Handbags are really expensive, and incredibly, the smaller they get, the more expensive they become.

手提包。手提包非常昂贵，而且令人难以置信的是，它们越小，价格就越高。

So a few summers ago, we actually endeavored to make the world's smallest handbag, microscopic, in fact, and somehow it ended up selling at auction for 63,000 dollars, incidentally making it the world's most expensive handbag per volume.

所以几年前的夏天，我们真的尝试制作了世界上最小的手提包，事实上是微观的，结果它竟然在拍卖会上以63000美元的价格售出，顺便成为世界上按体积计算最昂贵的手提包。

Here's another one. This is nothing like a handbag.

这是另一个例子。这和手提包完全不同。

You’ve probably seen those Boston Dynamics Spot dog robots that do TikTok dances with K-pop stars on YouTube.

你们可能见过那些**波士顿动力Spot机器狗**（Boston Dynamics Spot dog robots：波士顿动力公司开发的一种四足机器人），它们在YouTube上和韩国流行明星一起跳TikTok舞蹈。

Well, we managed to get one. Instead of making it dance, we strapped a paintball gun to it and we connected it remotely to a website where people could take turns driving it and firing it at an art gallery that we constructed.

我们弄到了一台。我们没有让它跳舞，而是给它绑了一把彩弹枪，并通过网站远程连接，人们可以轮流驾驶它，向我们建造的一个艺术画廊开火。

Boston Dynamics did not like that one very much.

波士顿动力公司对此非常不满。

### 拥抱“坏主意”：意想不到的火花

So you've probably figured out by now that I'm not actually here to sell you keys to a car.

所以你们现在可能已经明白，我来这里并不是真的要卖你们车钥匙。

Today I'm here to talk to you about bad ideas.

今天我来这里是要和你们谈谈“坏主意”。

The kind of ideas that typically die on the vine because reason or work colleagues get in the way.

那种通常会胎死腹中的想法，因为理智或同事的阻挠。

But to me, these are the most exciting ideas because you just never know what might happen.

但对我来说，这些是最令人兴奋的想法，因为你永远不知道会发生什么。

Take these crazy-looking shoes, for example. I think it was like the spring of 2023.

以这些看起来很疯狂的鞋子为例。我想那是在2023年春天。

My colleagues and I were sketching out the initial prototypes of the Big Red Boot.

我和我的同事们正在勾勒**大红靴**（Big Red Boot：Mschf推出的一款造型夸张的红色卡通靴子）的最初原型。

I remember us being equal parts terrified because, of course, like, who's going to wear these, much less spend money on them?

我记得我们当时既害怕又兴奋，因为，当然，谁会穿这种鞋呢，更别说花钱买它们了？

But at the same time, the moment that we put on the initial prototypes ourselves -- We were filled with such a chaotic sense of glee that we were like, you know what, we just got to do it.

但与此同时，当我们自己穿上最初的原型时——我们充满了那种混乱的狂喜感，我们觉得，你知道吗，我们必须做出来。

So we committed to making a couple hundred pairs, we priced them at 350 dollars and we just prayed that there would be a few hundred people out there in the world who would spend money on these crazy-looking things.

所以我们决定制作几百双，定价350美元，我们只是祈祷世界上会有几百人愿意花钱买这些看起来很疯狂的东西。

So a week before the drop, we leaked this image through a friend's Instagram account.

所以在发售前一周，我们通过一个朋友的Instagram账号泄露了这张图片。

Again, just hoping that people don't hate it, or even worse, that they don't ignore it.

再次，只是希望人们不要讨厌它，或者更糟的是，不要忽视它。

In hindsight, we needn't have worried. The algorithm smiled quite fondly upon the Big Red Boot, and all of a sudden this thing was everywhere.

事后看来，我们根本不必担心。算法对大红靴青睐有加，突然之间，这东西无处不在。

Like, I don't even, I can't even. It's basically like a blur. I don't understand what happened.

我甚至无法形容。基本上就像一片模糊。我不明白发生了什么。

All of a sudden, people were wearing them courtside at NBA games. I saw Lil Wayne wearing them in a music video.

突然之间，人们在NBA比赛场边穿着它们。我看到Lil Wayne在音乐视频中穿着它们。

I remember my dad calling me and saying, "Hey, Gabe, there's a professional WWE wrestler wearing your boots on live pay-per-view TV. And he just curb stomped another guy." It's incredible.

我记得我爸爸打电话给我说：“嘿，盖布，有个WWE职业摔跤手在付费直播电视上穿着你的靴子。他还用脚踩了另一个人。”这太不可思议了。

And yet we almost didn't do it. This is almost where it ended. Just as an internal project on the cutting room floor.

然而我们差点就没做。这几乎就是它的终点。仅仅作为一个内部项目被搁置。

People told us it was not a great business decision. And honestly, I get it.

人们告诉我们这不是一个好的商业决定。老实说，我理解。

But what started as a bad idea ended up becoming a very interesting idea.

但一个最初被认为是坏主意的想法，最终却变成了一个非常有趣的想法。

### ATM排行榜：金融透明的社会实验

Here's another one. The idea was an ATM machine.

这是另一个。这个想法是一台**ATM机**（Automated Teller Machine：自动柜员机，即自动取款机）。

Totally normal, functional, operational, extremely legal ATM machine, with one catch.

一台完全正常、功能齐全、可操作、极其合法的ATM机，但有一个例外。

Attached to the ATM machine, as you see, is a digital leaderboard that ranks people based on the amount of money in their remaining account balances.

正如你所看到的，ATM机上附有一个数字排行榜，根据人们账户中剩余的金额进行排名。

I'm glad you guys think it's funny. I thought it was horrifying.

我很高兴你们觉得这很有趣。我当时觉得这很可怕。

So it wasn't enough for us to just make this. We had to put it in the right place.

所以仅仅制作出来是不够的。我们必须把它放在正确的地方。

Does it go outside our studio in Brooklyn? Do we put it in Times Square?

是放在我们布鲁克林的 स्टूडियो外面吗？还是放在时代广场？

My colleagues and I conferred for a little bit, and we realized there's only one place that this thing can ever go. It's **Art Basel Miami** (巴塞尔艺术展迈阿密海滩展会：全球知名的国际当代艺术博览会之一).

我和我的同事们商量了一会儿，我们意识到这东西只能去一个地方。那就是巴塞尔艺术展迈阿密海滩展会。

So we take it to Miami. Somehow, we get our way into a gallery and we get into a booth.

所以我们把它带到迈阿密。不知怎么的，我们设法进入了一个画廊，并有了一个展位。

And on day one, people were actually a little bit hesitant to engage, which I totally get it. It's a little bit shady. It's participatory, I understand.

第一天，人们实际上有点犹豫是否参与，我完全理解。这有点可疑。它是参与式的，我明白。

But eventually people would muster up the courage to swipe their card.

但最终人们会鼓起勇气刷卡。

They would clock in at like 100 dollars in their bank account balance, maybe 1,200 dollars in their bank account balance.

他们会显示银行账户余额有100美元，也许是1200美元。

By the end of the day, however, someone ended up swiping and clocked in at 12,000 dollars in their bank account balance.

然而到了那天结束时，有人刷卡后显示银行账户余额有12000美元。

And then things started to get a little bit weird.

然后事情开始变得有点奇怪。

The next day, a famous celebrity DJ named Diplo showed up with his entire entourage, pulled out his debit card, swiped it in the machine, clocked in at three million dollars in his bank account, and shot to the top of the leaderboard.

第二天，一位名叫Diplo的著名DJ带着他的随行人员出现了，他拿出借记卡，在机器上刷了一下，银行账户显示有三百万美元，一举冲上了排行榜榜首。

And honestly, the rest is kind of hazy because a crowd amassed so huge around the ATM machine for the following three days that the art fair actually assigned five extra security guards not to protect the ATM machine, but to keep the crowd from bumping into the artworks of the neighboring galleries, which was actually very funny.

老实说，接下来的事情有点模糊，因为在接下来的三天里，ATM机周围聚集了如此庞大的人群，以至于艺术展会实际上增派了五名额外的保安，不是为了保护ATM机，而是为了防止人群撞到邻近画廊的艺术品，这实际上非常有趣。

But the most interesting thing that I got to observe here was this unexpected crowd dynamic where when people with astonishingly low bank accounts would swipe their cards, in front of this captive audience, by the way -- and I'm talking really low, like two dollars, concerningly low -- They would swipe, they would get ranked at the bottom, and then they would turn around to face the audience, and the audience would lose their minds -- they were cheering and screaming and celebrating and clapping and taking pictures.

但在这里我观察到的最有趣的事情是这种意想不到的人群动态：当那些银行账户余额惊人地低的人刷卡时，顺便说一下，是在这群被吸引的观众面前——我说的是真的很低，比如两美元，低得令人担忧——他们刷卡后，排名垫底，然后他们会转身面对观众，而观众会疯狂起来——他们欢呼、尖叫、庆祝、鼓掌和拍照。

And it was sincere. It was actually like this wholesome "one of us"-like celebration, which was not anything that we expected.

那是真诚的。那实际上就像是一种健康的“我们中的一员”式的庆祝，这完全出乎我们的意料。

And then to sort of wrap up that week, the funny thing is, a buyer ended up acquiring the ATM machine as a sculpture for a whopping 75,000 dollars.

然后，为了结束那一周，有趣的是，一位买家最终以高达75000美元的价格将这台ATM机作为雕塑购得。

But the funny thing to me is, I don't think that person ever realized that the artwork was not the ATM machine.

但对我来说，有趣的是，我不知道那个人是否意识到艺术品并非ATM机本身。

The artwork was the act of people engaging with the ATM machine. The actual artwork was the relationships that people developed with one another via the ATM machine.

艺术品是人们与ATM机互动的行为。真正的艺术品是人们通过ATM机彼此建立的关系。

See, when we made this thing originally, we were pretty sure it was going to reflect all the worst parts of humanity at Art Basel Miami.

看，当我们最初制作这个东西时，我们非常确定它会反映出巴塞尔艺术展迈阿密海滩展会上人性中最糟糕的一面。

But we were wrong. It ended up just being a random crowd of total strangers having a great time together in one big awkward, shared moment of financial transparency.

但我们错了。它最终只是一群完全陌生的人，在一个巨大的、尴尬的、共享的金融透明时刻，一起度过了愉快的时光。

### 更多“坏主意”：挑战常规的创造

Oh, I'm not done yet. I'm not done yet. So when you open **Pandora's box** (潘多拉的盒子：源自希腊神话，比喻灾祸的根源或一旦打开便会释放出不可预测的麻烦的事物) of bad ideas, clearly the sky's the limit. So let's keep pushing it. I got three minutes.

哦，我还没讲完。我还没讲完。所以当你打开坏主意的潘多拉的盒子时，显然是无限可能。所以让我们继续推进。我还有三分钟。

This is a big fruit loop. I don't -- there's not much else to say. It's real. It's about the size of a dinner plate. It takes a lot of milk to put down, but I assure you, it's just as good as the original.

这是一个巨大的水果圈麦片。我——没什么好说的了。它是真的。大约有餐盘那么大。需要很多牛奶才能吃完，但我向你保证，它和原版一样好吃。

This is what we call an **Alexagate** (Alexagate：Mschf推出的一款旨在阻止智能音箱窃听的电子设备). It's an electronics device armed with seven ultrasonic speakers at its base that blasts **white noise** (白噪音：一种包含所有频率的声音，常用于掩盖其他噪音或帮助睡眠) into the mic of any Alexa device to keep it from eavesdropping on you when you're not using it.

这就是我们所说的Alexagate。它是一种电子设备，底部装有七个超声波扬声器，可以向任何Alexa设备的麦克风发射白噪音，以防止你在不使用它时被窃听。

And then this one is a life-size sculpture that keeps track of and counts the number of times anyone has touched it.

然后这个是一个真人大小的雕塑，它会记录并计算任何人触摸它的次数。

Because if you ever go to a gallery or museum, you know you're not supposed to touch the art. So this is supposed to discourage people touching the art.

因为如果你去画廊或博物馆，你知道你不应该触摸艺术品。所以这个就是为了阻止人们触摸艺术品。

### PT漫步者的回归：社群的诞生

Right. Actually, I wanted to wrap up the story about the car because it is real.

好的。实际上，我想讲完关于那辆车的故事，因为它是真的。

If you take a second later, it's parked outside. It's here on the loop, so go find it.

如果你稍后去看，它就停在外面。它就在这个环路上，所以去找到它吧。

The car was real. The 5,000 keys were real. We released this to the world in the fall of 2022, and for the following nine months, we actually got to watch this thing change hands hundreds, if not thousands of times, mostly via very peaceful communal meetups and the occasional **Grand Theft Auto** (汽车盗窃：此处双关知名游戏《侠盗猎车手》), which I can't really talk too much about here.

这辆车是真的。5000把钥匙是真的。我们在2022年秋天向世界发布了它，在接下来的九个月里，我们亲眼看到这东西易手数百次，甚至数千次，主要通过非常和平的社区聚会和偶尔的汽车盗窃，对此我在这里不能谈论太多。

Over that nine months, it started in New York, it made its way down to Philadelphia, it stayed in Philadelphia for a few days. Grand Theft Auto.

在那九个月里，它从纽约开始，一路南下到费城，在费城待了几天。汽车盗窃。

And then eventually made its way across the Midwest to the West Coast, where nine months later, I mean, the **GPS** (全球定位系统：一种利用卫星信号提供地理位置信息的系统) stopped.

然后最终穿过中西部到达西海岸，九个月后，我的意思是，GPS停止了。

We kind of assumed that the project was over. Which is OK. It had a glorious life.

我们有点以为这个项目结束了。没关系。它有过辉煌的生命。

But then one day I get a call, and it's a call from a tow pound.

但有一天我接到一个电话，是来自一个拖车场。

And the tow pound is saying, "Hey, we're pretty sure that we have your car because it is registered under your name. But it's such a weird thing because people keep showing up and claiming the car, and they all have keys that work."

拖车场说：“嘿，我们很确定我们有你的车，因为它登记在你的名下。但这太奇怪了，因为不断有人出现并认领这辆车，而且他们都有能用的钥匙。”

So we ended up taking the car back, it was no longer functional, and we decided to place it in an art gallery in Los Angeles.

所以我们最终把车取了回来，它已经不能用了，我们决定把它放在洛杉矶的一个艺术画廊里。

And at this gallery, actually, I got to attend the opening, and at the opening I observed something that I totally did not expect to see, which was purchasers of the key had flown in from all over the country, not just to see the thing that they had touched and interacted with show up in a gallery, but they were actually there to meet each other for the first time.

而在这个画廊里，实际上，我参加了开幕式，在开幕式上我观察到了一些我完全没料到的事情，那就是钥匙的购买者从全国各地飞来，他们不仅仅是为了看到自己曾经触摸和互动过的东西出现在画廊里，他们实际上是为了第一次与彼此见面。

I watched them taking photos and sharing stories of their own individual escapades with the car, and I took a step back and realized this project was never about the car.

我看着他们拍照，分享各自与这辆车相关的冒险故事，我退后一步意识到，这个项目从来都不是关于这辆车。

It was never about the keys. It was about the people.

它从来都不是关于钥匙。它是关于人的。

Like, it really was about the friends you make along the way.

就像，它真的是关于你在旅途中结交的朋友。

And now if you see the car, you'll see it outside, I mean, it looks nothing like it did when we started out.

现在如果你看到那辆车，你会看到它在外面，我的意思是，它看起来和我们刚开始时完全不同了。

The faux wood paneling is gone, regrettably, but now it's covered in paint, drawings, scribbled messages from complete strangers to other total strangers.

仿木镶板不见了，很遗憾，但现在它上面覆盖着油漆、图画，以及完全陌生人写给其他陌生人的涂鸦信息。

It's no longer a car. Now it's a rallying point for this weird little random community that sprang up out of nowhere and gave this thing a life of its own.

它不再是一辆车了。现在它成为了这个奇怪的、随机的、凭空出现的社区的集结点，并赋予了这东西自己的生命。

### 总结：拥抱不适，探索未知

And with that, I'd like to invite each and every one of you to reach under your seat. Because I've placed -- Sorry, sorry, sorry. They told me not to do that. I did it anyways. This is my first and last TED Talk. Whatever.

说到这里，我想邀请你们每个人都把手伸到座位下面。因为我放了——抱歉，抱歉，抱歉。他们告诉我不要这样做。但我还是做了。这是我第一次也是最后一次TED演讲。随便吧。

Anyways, we all know that keys, they start cars just like ATM machines are supposed to dispense cash. Just like Big Red Boots are supposed to be shoes.

无论如何，我们都知道钥匙是用来启动汽车的，就像ATM机是用来取钱的。就像大红靴应该是鞋子一样。

But in the case of the bad idea, none of these ended up being what they appeared to be on the surface.

但就“坏主意”而言，这些东西最终都没有像它们表面看起来的那样。

They ended up taking a life of their own, and they all became something else entirely, for better or for worse.

它们最终拥有了自己的生命，并且都完全变成了别的东西，无论是好是坏。

And to me, that's the most exciting thing about it all.

对我来说，这是所有这些中最令人兴奋的事情。

I'm not necessarily saying that bad ideas are good ideas. All I'm saying is give yourself a chance to explore the thing that makes you uncomfortable, because you just never know what might happen.

我并不是说坏主意就是好主意。我只是说，给自己一个机会去探索那些让你感到不舒服的事物，因为你永远不知道会发生什么。

All right. Thank you.

好的。谢谢大家。
