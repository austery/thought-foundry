Financial

 turned
 your


retirement
 dreams
 into
 a

 so


digestible
 even
 your
 smartphone
 can


serve
 it
 to
 you
 between
 Tik
 Tok


videos
 these
 investment
 vehicles
 are


wall
 Street's
 answer
 to
 mass
 production


they
 take
 capital
 from
 thousands
 of


aspiring
 Warren
 buffets
 and


algorithmically
 spread
 it
 across
 markets


like
 a
 farmer
 with
 infinite
 arms
 think


of
 it
 as
 having
 a
 team
 of
 quants
 manage


your
 money
 except
 half
 of
 them
 are


actual
 robots
 running
 on
 code
 written


during
 the
 OB

 the
 key


difference
 ETFs
 trade
 like

 giving


you
 the
 freedom
 to
 sabotage
 your

 price
 once

 a
 clever


invention
 designed

 protect
 you
 from


your

 pattern
 seeking
 brain
 and
 that


hot
 stock
 tip
 you
 read
 on
 Reddit
 they


generate
 Revenue
 through

 fees


a
 mathematical
 Marvel
 where
 decimals


transform
 into
 billions
 active
 funds


charge
 premium
 rates
 promising
 to


outsmart
 the
 market
 through
 human


intuition
 and
 Ivy
 League
 degrees
 their


success
 rate
 roughly
 matches
 that
 of


astrology
 but
 with
 better
 marketing
 but


if
 you're
 tired
 of
 mass--
 produced


Financial
 products
 let
 me
 introduce
 you


to
 the
 artisanal
 world
 of
 private
 Equity


where
 every
 deal
 is
 custom
 made
 to


maximize
 investor
 tear
 welcome
 to


private
 Equity
 where
 Financial


Architects
 spot
 Diamonds
 in
 the
 Rough


and
 turn
 them
 into
 polished
 gems
 though


sometimes
 their
 polishing
 methods


involve
 a
 sledgehammer
 these


mastercrafts
 and
 raise
 capital
 from


institutions
 with
 more
 money
 than
 most


countries
 GDP
 their
 strategy
 buy


underperforming
 companies
 optimize
 them


with
 the
 enthusiasm
 of
 a
 caffeinated


efficiency
 expert
 and
 transform
 them


into
 lean
 mean
 profit
 generating


machines
 it's
 like
 flipping
 houses
 if


houses
 came
 with
 thousands
 of
 employees


and
 an
 industrial-sized
 coffee
 budget


their
 profit
 formula
 is
 elegantly


straightforward
 first
 charge
 management


fees
 that
 would
 impress
 a
 luxury

salesmen
 2%
 of

 for
 their

 take
 20%
 of

because
 Excellence
 deserves
 a
 proper


reward
 finally
 extract
 dividends
 through


operational
 improvements
 at
 speeds
 that


would
 make
 a
 Formula
 1
 pit
 crew
 jealous


quick
 pause
 my
 friend
 strongly
 believes


that
 private
 Equity
 is
 more
 interesting


than
 hedge
 funds
 because
 you
 get
 to


reimagine
 and
 rebuild
 entire
 companies


however
 I
 find
 the
 idea
 of
 distilling


the
 chaos
 of
 financial
 markets
 into


profit
 generating
 patterns
 much
 more


fascinating
 leave
 a
 comment
 letting
 us


know
 who's
 right
 so
 we
 can
 settle
 this


debate
 once
 and
 for
 all
 but
 if
 you
 think


PE
 firms
 are
 creative
 wait
 until
 you


meet
 the
 quantum
 physicists
 of
 Finance


hedge
 funds
 where
 phds
 turn
 Market


patterns
 into
 mathematical
 Symphonies


the
 welcome
 to
 hedge
 funds
 where


Brilliant
 Minds
 turn
 Market
 complexity


into
 Artistry
 imagine
 a
 chess


Grandmaster
 playing
 on
 multiple
 boards


WS
 simultaneously
 except
 the
 pieces
 are


made
 of
 your
 pension
 fund
 these


mathematical
 maestros
 deploy
 Capital


across
 any
 Market
 that
 catches
 their
 eye


stocks
 bonds
 currencies
 Commodities
 you


name
 it
 unlike
 traditional
 funds
 they


can
 bet
 on
 both
 Rises
 and
 Falls
 using


leverage
 to
 amplify
 their
 moves
 like
 a


financial
 sound
 mixer
 adjusting
 Market


frequencies
 their
 strategy
 combines
 deep


research
 with
 swift
 execution
 turning


Market
 inefficiencies
 into
 opportunities


faster
 than
 you
 can
 say
 algorithmic


Trading
 think
 of
 it
 as
 having
 a
 team
 of


quantum
 physicists
 design
 your


investment
 strategy
 complete
 with
 more


Greek
 letters
 than
 a
 Fraternity
 Row
 they


make
 money
 through
 the
 classic
 2
 and20


composition
 2%
 for
 conducting
 the


orchestra
 20%
 for
 hitting
 the
 right


notes
 some
 legendary
 funds
 like


Renaissance
 Technologies
 charge
 even


more
 but
 when
 you're
 turning
 Market


noise
 into
 symphonic
 returns
 who's


counting
 but
 if
 you
 think
 hedge
 funds


are
 sophisticated


wait
 until
 you
 see
 how
 entire
 nations


conduct
 their
 financial
 Orchestra


welcome
 to
 Sovereign
 wealth
 funds
 where


Nations
 turn
 their
 natural
 resources


into
 Financial
 power
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a


country's
 savings
 account
 if
 that


savings
 account
 could
 buy
 every
 house
 on


your
 street
 these
 state
 owned
 investment


Giants
 take
 Surplus
 Capital
 usually
 from


oil
 revenues
 or
 trade
 surpluses
 and


deploy
 it
 across
 Global
 markets
 with
 the


patience
 of
 a
 redwood
 tree
 Norway's
 fund


alone
 owns


1.5%
 of
 every
 listed
 company
 on
 Earth


making
 most
 diversification
 strategies


look
 like
 a
 corner
 store
 inventory
 their


approach
 buy
 everything
 worth
 owning
 and


hold
 it
 until
 the
 Sun
 Burns
 Out
 they


invest
 in
 stocks
 bonds
 real
 estate
 and


infrastructure
 with
 the
 methodical


Precision
 of
 a
 master
 watchmaker
 unlike


their
 shorter
 term
 cousins
 they
 measure


success
 in
 decades
 not
 quarters
 they


make
 money
 through
 the
 most


straightforward
 strategy
 in
 finance
 buy


highquality
 assets
 everywhere
 and
 let


compound
 interest
 work
 its
 magic
 it's


like
 playing
 Monopoly
 with
 a
 country's


GDP
 except
 the
 game
 never
 ends
 and


everyone's
 invited
 to
 play
 but
 if
 you


think
 government
 investors
 are
 patient


wait
 until
 you
 see
 how
 Pension

turn
 Actuarial
 tables
 into
 investment


poetry
 welcome
 to
 Pension
 funds
 where


actuaries
 perform
 Financial
 time
 travel


calculating
 how
 much

 will


pay
 for
 tomorrow's
 retirement
 dreams


these
 institutional
 orchestras
 manage


retirement
 savings
 for
 millions
 of


workers


from

 Firefighters
 to
 that


person

 been
 making


the

 since

ran
 on
 Punch
 Cards
 their
 mission


generates
 steady
 returns
 that
 Outlast


both
 Market
 cycles
 and
 human
 lifespans


their
 investment
 strategy
 is
 like
 a


well-balanced
 diet
 a
 healthy
 mix
 of


stocks
 for
 growth
 bonds
 for
 stability


and
 alternatives
 for
 when
 those
 two


aren't
 quite
 enough
 think
 of
 it
 as


cooking
 for
 a
 multi-generational
 family


dinner
 where
 everyone
 needs
 to
 leave


satisfied
 for
 the
 next
 30
 Years
 years


they
 make
 money
 through

and
 careful

of
 a

 their


actuaries
 spend
 countless
 hours
 ensuring


the
 math
 works
 even
 if
 their
 return


assumptions
 occasionally
 read
 like


optimistic
 horoscopes
 but
 if
 you
 think


planning
 for
 retirement
 is
 complex
 wait


until
 you
 meet
 the
 ultimate
 long-term

 foundation

where

 where

Horizons
 stretch
 Beyond

picture
 of
 financial
 marathon
 where
 the


Finish
 Line
 keeps
 moving
 further
 away


and
 that's
 exactly
 how
 they
 like
 it


these
 Perpetual

 manage


money
 for
 universities
 hospitals
 and


Foundations
 with
 the
 kind
 of
 patients


that
 makes

 look
 Hasty
 Yale's

 has
 been
 growing
 since
 before

 and
 they're


still
 thinking
 longterm
 their
 secret


weapon
 the
 Yale
 Model
 A
 sophisticated


investment
 approach
 that
 combines


traditional
 assets
 with
 anything


promising
 returns
 they
 invest
 like


Venture
 capitalists
 of
 the
 institutional


World
 always
 seeking
 the
 next
 great


opportunity
 before
 others
 catch
 on
 from


private
 Equity
 to
 Timber
 forests
 if
 it


can
 generate
 sustainable
 returns
 it's
 on


their
 radar
 they
 make
 money
 by
 spreading

 across
 the
 entire

 the

while
 keeping
 the

 growing


faster
 than

 Ambitions
 but
 if


you
 think

 know
 how
 to


invest
 wait
 until
 you
 see
 how
 old
 money


stays
 new
 welcome
 to
 family
 offices


where
 generational
 wealth
 gets
 managed


with
 the
 attention
 of
 a

 entire
 life


through
 retirement
 these
 Boutique


institutions
 manage
 money
 for
 families


wealthy
 enough
 to
 have
 their
 own


investment
 teams
 but
 discreet
 enough
 to


actually
 mean
 it
 when
 they
 say
 we
 like

 that


Charming

 you
 thought


was

 technically
 it
 still
 is


just
 not
 the
 family
 you
 imagined
 unlike


other
 funds
 they're
 playing
 the
 ultimate


long
 game
 preserving
 wealth
 across


Generations
 they
 make
 money
 through


careful
 investing
 and

 success


means
 the

 grows

than
 the

 if
 you
 think

 is

you
 see
 how

 Banks
 juggle


everyone

 money
 at
 once
 hey


welcome
 to
 Investment
 Bank
 Asset


Management
 where
 wall
 Street's


dealmakers

 wait


until
 you
 see
 how
 real

 funds
 turn


buildings
 into
 money-making
 machines


welcome
 to
 real

 funds
 where


property
 investing
 meets
 Financial


Wizardry
 think
 of
 it
 as
 real
 estate


investing
 without
 having
 to
 unclog
 any


toilets
 These
 funds
 come
 in
 two
 flavors


reads
 for
 everyday
 investors
 and
 private


real

 funds
 for
 those
 who
 view


million
 dooll
 minimums
 as
 a
 reasonable


starting
 point
 both
 transform
 physical


properties
 into
 tradable
 Investments


with
 the
 Elegance
 of
 an
 architectural


blueprint
 their
 strategy
 acquire


properties
 fill
 them
 with
 quality


tenants
 and
 optimize
 every
 square
 foot


for
 maximum
 value
 unlike
 traditional


landlords
 they
 have
 data
 proving
 that


better

 must
 distribute
 90%


of
 their
 income
 to

 making


them
 the
 most
 reliable

 machines


in
 the
 investment
 World
 they
 make
 money


from
 three
 sources
 collecting
 rent
 with


the
 efficiency
 of
 a
 Swiss
 watch
 property


appreciation
 in
 growing
 markets
 and
 the


magic
 of
 Leverage
 because
 good
 buildings


like
 good
 wine
 are
 worth
 borrowing
 for


but
 if
 you
 think
 real
 estate
 is


fascinating
 wait
 until
 you
 see
 how


Venture
 Capital
 turns
 wild
 ideas
 and


energy
 drinks
 into
 million
 dollar


companies
 welcome
 to
 venture
 capital


where
 investors
 turn
 PowerPoint


presentations

 into

think
 of
 it
 as
 Dragon's

 these


opportunity

 some

 a

everything
 else
 their
 approach
 is
 part


science
 heart
 art
 invest
 early
 in


promising
 teams
 help
 them
 grow
 through


networks
 and
 expertise
 then
 hopefully


ride
 that
 hockey
 stick
 growth
 curve
 to


an
 exit
 unlike
 private
 equity's
 focus
 on


existing
 businesses
 VC's
 bet
 on


potential
 trading
 steady
 cash
 flows
 for


the
 chance
 of
 exponential
 returns
 they


make
 money
 through
 the
 classic
 2
 and20


model
 plus
 the
 occasional
 unicorn
 that


turns
 their
 fund
 into
 a
 legend
 success


means
 turning
 what
 if
 into
 to
 what's


next
 faster
 than
 competitors
 can
 say


disruptive
 technology
 but
 if
 you
 think


betting
 on
 startups
 is
 adventurous
 wait


until
 you
 see
 how
 credit
 funds
 turn


corporate
 debt
 into
 predictable
 profits


welcome
 to
 credit

 where
 investors


turn
 corporate
 IUS
 into

Banker
 minus
 the
 free


lollipops
 these
 funds
 stepped
 in
 when


traditional
 Banks
 stepped
 back
 from


lending
 they
 provide
 financing
 to


everything
 from
 growing
 businesses
 to


companies
 going
 through
 rough
 patches


filling
 the
 gap
 between
 bank
 loans
 and


the
 stock
 market
 their
 strategy
 ranges


from
 conservative
 to
 spicy
 some
 collect


steady
 interest
 from
 stable
 corporate


bonds
 like
 a
 landlord
 collecting
 rent


others
 hunt
 for
 bargains
 and
 troubled


debt
 markets
 buying
 loans
 at
 a
 discount


from
 anxious
 sellers
 the
 boldest
 ones


directly
 lend
 to
 companies
 crafting


custom
 financing
 Solutions
 like


Financial
 artists
 they
 make
 money


through
 interest
 payments
 fees
 and


occasionally
 converting
 debt
 to
 equity


when
 companies
 need
 a
 fresh
 start
 it's


like
 collecting
 rent
 on
 money
 instead
 of


real
 estate
 with
 the
 added
 excitement
 of


helping
 businesses
 grow
 or
 recover
 but


if
 you
 think
 lending
 is
 straightforward


wait
 until
 you
 see
 how
 infrastructure


funds
 turn
 Bridges
 and
 airports
 into


Decades
 of
 steady
 cash
 flow
 welcome
 to


infrastructure
 funds
 where
 patient


investors
 turn
 society's
 building
 blocks


into
 steady
 cash
 flows
 and
 imagine


collecting
 tolls
 on
 every
 bridge
 in
 your


city
 without
 the
 hassle
 of
 repainting


them
 These
 funds
 invest
 in
 the


essentials
 airports
 highways
 power


plants
 and
 anything
 else
 modern


civilization
 can't
 live
 without
 they're


the
 financial
 equivalent
 of
 buying
 a


toll
 bridge
 expensive
 upfront
 but
 people


will
 always
 need
 to
 cross
 their
 strategy


combines
 the
 thrill
 of
 watching
 concrete


cure
 with
 the
 satisfaction
 of
 guaranteed


customers
 they
 acquire
 or
 build
 critical


infrastructure
 then
 collect
 user
 fees


for
 decades
 while
 politicians
 thank
 them


for
 making
 their
 cities
 work
 better


unlike
 Trend
 chasing
 investors
 these


folks
 measure
 success
 in
 half
 centuries


they
 make
 money
 through
 predictable
 user


fees
 and
 long-term
 contracts
 after
 all


people
 always
 need
 electricity
 water
 and


Roads
 regardless
 of
 what
 the
 stock


market
 is
 doing
 and
 there
 you
 have
 it


from

 each
