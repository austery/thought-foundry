If
 you
 want
 to
 be
 the
 best
 company
 in


the
 world,
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 work
 the


hardest
 in
 the
 world.
 It's
 like
 anything


else.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 be
 the
 best


athlete,
 you
 want
 to
 be
 the
 best


musician,
 you're
 practicing
 non-stop.


Work
 in
 a
 tech
 startup
 is
 exactly
 the


same
 thing.
 When
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 that's
 not
 something
 that
 you
 can


kind
 of
 fall
 back
 on.
 You
 have
 to
 do


everything
 yourself.
 And
 you
 should
 talk


to
 all
 of
 your
 customers,
 handle
 all
 of


your
 customer
 success,
 support
 tickets.


You
 should
 do
 sales
 yourself.
 that
 helps


you
 really
 focus
 on
 exactly
 what
 your


customers
 are
 asking
 for
 and
 what


they're
 willing
 to
 pay
 for.
 When
 we


launched
 our
 product
 with
 our
 first


national
 customer,
 we
 were
 just
 two


people
 at
 the
 time.
 It
 was
 just
 me
 and


and
 Tony,
 my
 co-founder.
 It
 was
 a


24-hour
 service.
 So,
 that
 meant
 he


stayed
 up
 until
 4:00
 a.m.
 and
 I
 woke
 up


at
 4:00
 a.m.
 and
 watched
 it.
 That
 was


probably
 the
 most
 physically
 draining


time,
 but
 we
 were
 able
 to
 survive.
 Yeah,


it
 was
 a
 really
 exhausting
 time
 of


course,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter.


You
 have
 problems.
 You
 have
 customers


that
 need
 things.
 It's
 just
 about
 every


single
 day
 doing
 everything
 that
 you
 can


prevent
 your
 company
 from
 dying.
 And


even
 when
 you're
 exhausted,
 I
 think


that's
 a
 pretty
 motivating.
 It's
 a


stressful
 thing
 to
 start
 a
 company.
 It's


a
 stressful
 thing
 to
 work
 at
 a
 at
 a


startup
 that's
 growing.
 You
 have
 to
 take


one
 step
 in
 front
 of
 the
 other
 just
 to


solve
 problems
 over
 time.
 being
 a


cockroach
 where
 you
 can't
 let
 anything


kill
 you
 ever.


My
 name
 is
 Minong
 and
 I'm
 the
 co-founder


and
 the
 CEO
 of
 Elise
 AI.
 Elise
 AI
 is
 a


tech
 company
 that
 uses
 AI
 to
 drive
 real


world
 impact
 and
 we
 are
 starting
 with


two
 of
 the
 most
 critical
 industries
 that


make
 up
 over
 40%
 of
 the
 US
 GDP.
 the


housing
 industry
 and
 the
 healthcare


industry.
 Elise
 AAI
 is
 used
 by
 over
 10%


of
 the
 US
 apartments
 today
 and
 over


twothirds
 of
 the
 largest
 property


management
 companies
 use
 our
 software.


We
 raised
 a
 $250
 million
 series
 E
 round


which
 was
 led
 by
 Andre
 and
 Horowitz
 and


participated
 in
 by
 Bessemer
 Venture


Partners
 as
 well
 as
 previous
 investors


Sapphire
 Ventures
 and
 Navatas
 Capital.


Our
 company
 has
 been
 doubling


consistently
 year-over-year
 for
 the
 last


four
 years,
 and
 we
 passed
 100
 million


annual
 recurring
 revenue
 earlier
 this


year.


[Music]


>> I
 met
 my
 co-founder
 in
 college.
 So,


while
 I
 went
 to
 MIT,
 he
 actually
 met
 him


studying
 abroad
 at
 the
 University
 of


Cambridge
 in
 the
 UK.
 So
 we
 we
 both
 come


from
 software
 engineering
 backgrounds


and
 felt
 that
 we
 should
 apply
 technology


to
 doing
 something
 good
 in
 the
 world.
 I


think
 it's
 pretty
 obvious
 tech
 is
 the


fastest
 way
 to
 bring
 massive
 scale


impact
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 it
 was
 pretty


clear
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to
 start
 a


technology
 company
 someday.
 When
 we


started
 Elise,
 we
 actually
 wanted
 to


start
 understanding
 the
 industry
 that
 we


were
 operating
 in
 and
 really
 knew


nothing
 about
 the
 housing
 industry


except
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 do
 something


really,
 really
 big
 in
 it.
 And
 so
 when
 I


got
 started,
 I
 started
 working
 at
 a
 real


estate
 firm
 here
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 And


that
 gave
 me
 a
 great
 opportunity
 to
 meet


a
 lot
 of
 people.
 So
 I
 took
 a
 front
 desk


job
 where
 I
 greeted
 everyone
 who
 came


through
 the
 door.
 I
 picked
 up
 all
 the


phone
 calls
 and
 that's
 how
 we
 got
 the


experience
 and
 understanding
 of
 the


industry
 that
 helped
 us
 decide
 what
 we


wanted
 to
 build.
 I
 uh
 actually
 don't


think
 it's
 extreme
 at
 all.
 I
 think
 it's


actually
 quite
 insane
 when
 people
 don't


try
 to
 spend
 time
 really
 understanding
 a


problem
 before
 they
 try
 to
 solve
 it
 and


then
 they
 waste
 years
 and
 years
 of


building
 technology
 that
 never
 finds


product
 market
 fit.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 was


maybe
 one
 of
 the
 most
 obvious
 uh
 and


rational
 decisions
 that
 we've
 ever
 made,


which
 is
 just
 just
 learn
 learn
 about
 the


people
 that
 you're
 building
 for.
 Learn


about
 the
 problems.
 Uh
 especially


because
 we
 didn't
 come
 from
 a
 background


in
 housing
 at
 all.
 It's
 really


important,
 especially
 in
 industries
 like


housing
 and
 healthcare
 where
 so
 much


happens
 in
 person.
 It
 doesn't
 all
 happen


in
 the
 digital
 world.
 So,
 you
 can't
 just


look
 at
 metrics.
 You
 can't
 look
 at
 users


and
 how
 they
 interact
 with
 your
 online


products.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 there
 to


understand
 how
 they're
 interacting
 with


the
 real
 world.
 The
 problem
 was
 pretty


obvious.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 it
 wasn't


something
 that
 we
 had
 an
 aha
 moment.
 It


was
 just
 something
 people
 were


constantly
 complaining
 about.
 We
 just


keep
 tackling
 those
 one
 by
 one.
 Their


frustrations,
 they
 couldn't
 reach
 a


building.
 No
 one's
 answering
 their
 phone


calls.
 No
 one's
 answering
 their
 emails.


And
 so
 that's
 the
 exact
 problem
 that
 we


tried
 to
 solve.
 It
 wasn't
 really
 a


question
 about
 what
 the
 problem
 was.
 It


was
 really
 a
 question
 of
 is
 the


technology
 the
 right
 technology
 to
 solve


the
 problem
 and
 was
 it
 the
 right
 time
 in


2017?
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 didn't
 know
 what


AI
 was.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 didn't
 believe


that
 AI
 could
 answer
 their
 emails.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 didn't
 believe
 that
 AI
 would


do
 things
 better
 than
 humans
 in
 any


capacity.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 thought
 this


market
 was
 small
 because
 companies
 that


had
 been
 built
 in
 the
 industry
 before


never
 grew
 to
 be
 that
 large
 of


companies,
 but
 I
 can
 see
 that
 other


people
 over
 the
 years
 have
 have
 not
 seen


real
 estate
 as
 a
 sexy
 industry.
 But
 I


think
 housing
 was
 always
 sexy
 to
 us


because
 it's
 a
 fundamental
 human
 need.


It's
 an
 incredibly
 important
 part
 of


society
 and
 our
 lives.
 So
 why
 wouldn't


that
 be
 sexy?


The
 first
 10
 customers
 were
 really


brutal.
 We
 were
 cold
 calling.
 We
 were


knocking
 on
 doors
 all
 across
 New
 York


City.
 We
 got
 lucky
 with
 a
 few
 customers


who
 signed
 on
 and
 then
 we
 started


selling
 to
 national
 property
 management


companies.
 It
 was
 pretty
 crazy
 that
 we


ended
 up
 signing
 the
 first
 and
 second


largest
 apartment
 owners
 at
 the
 time


onto
 our
 platform
 for
 their
 entire


portfolio.
 And
 we
 were
 just
 two
 people


at
 the
 time.
 It
 was
 just
 me
 and
 and


Tony,
 my
 co-founder.
 So,
 we
 had
 these


large
 customers
 buying
 into
 a
 product


that
 two
 people
 had
 built
 that
 was
 meant


to
 run
 their
 entire
 real
 estate


portfolio.


How
 we
 convinced
 these
 large
 customers


to
 work
 with
 us.
 I
 remember
 I
 went
 to
 a


meeting.
 It
 was
 me
 and
 12
 executives,
 so


all
 of
 their
 sea
 level
 team
 essentially


sitting
 in
 a
 room
 with
 just
 me.
 I
 was
 in


my
 young
 20s.
 It
 was
 three
 hours
 of


asking
 me
 a
 ton
 of
 questions.
 Can
 your


product
 do
 this?
 Can
 your
 product
 do
 X?


Can
 your
 product
 do
 Y?
 And
 honestly,
 I


think
 I
 said
 for
 three
 hours
 straight,
 I


just
 said,
 "No,
 it
 doesn't
 do
 that."
 And


um
 I
 walked
 out
 of
 that
 meeting,
 called


my
 co-founder
 and
 said,
 "This
 was
 the


worst
 meeting
 of
 our
 lives.
 Just
 forget


it.
 That
 deal
 is
 dead."
 And
 then
 the


next
 day
 they
 called
 me
 back.
 The
 COO


called
 me
 and
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 do


this
 together.
 We're
 going
 to
 help
 you


build
 the
 product."
 They
 knew
 we
 were


early.
 We
 were
 not
 hiding
 the
 fact
 that


we
 were
 a
 tiny
 startup,
 but
 they


believed
 in
 us
 because
 they
 believed


they
 had
 a
 big
 problem
 and
 that
 they


could
 work
 with
 honest
 founders
 to


actually
 solve
 that.
 I
 think
 when
 you're


working
 with
 your
 first
 few
 customers,


you
 have
 to
 build
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that


they
 ask
 for.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 really


afraid
 of
 building
 too
 much
 or


overfitting
 for
 certain
 customers,
 but


the
 reality
 is
 that
 fear
 will
 paralyze


you.
 You
 really
 just
 need
 to
 build
 what


they
 ask
 for
 and
 then
 as
 you
 get


customer
 two,
 three,
 four,
 it'll
 give


you
 a
 lot
 more
 data
 points.
 And
 maybe


you've
 built
 something
 that's
 not


sustainable
 in
 the
 long
 run,
 but
 quite


honestly,
 I
 believe
 that
 your
 first


customers,
 you
 will
 have
 to
 service
 that


forever.
 That's
 a
 really
 common


attribute
 of
 early
 adopters
 is
 they
 want


a
 lot
 of
 control.
 That's
 why
 they
 picked


to
 work
 with
 an
 early
 stage
 startup
 in


the
 first
 place.
 But
 they
 do
 want
 a
 lot


of
 control
 and
 usually
 they
 want
 to


dictate
 what
 your
 road
 map
 looks
 like.


I'd
 say
 don't
 be
 afraid.
 I
 I
 think
 you


will
 make
 mistakes,
 but
 that's
 a
 normal


process
 I
 think
 in
 in
 building
 a
 massive


company.


In
 our
 first
 round
 of
 funding,
 we
 had


literally
 over
 100
 rejections.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 rejections
 were
 the
 same.
 They're


like,
 "We're
 not
 interested
 in
 this


market.
 We
 only
 look
 at
 horizontal
 SAS


or
 we
 only
 look
 at
 enterprise
 SAS
 and


things
 in
 the
 housing
 industry
 were
 not


really
 interesting
 to
 them.
 When
 we


didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 funding,
 we
 really


just
 relied
 on
 ourselves
 and
 our
 ability


to
 build
 features
 that
 our
 customers


were
 asking
 for.
 I
 think
 we
 were
 cash


constrained.
 So,
 we
 didn't
 have
 huge


engineering
 team
 to
 build
 lots
 of


features
 in
 parallel.
 But
 I
 think
 that


prioritization
 helped
 us
 build
 the


things
 that
 were
 absolutely
 the
 most


critical
 that
 had
 the
 highest
 amount
 of


value,
 not
 ancillary
 features
 or


features
 that
 were
 just
 providing
 kind


of
 optics
 for
 customers
 to
 to
 think
 that


they
 were
 kind
 of
 featureful
 products.


So
 I
 think
 money
 doesn't
 actually
 solve


a
 lot
 of
 problems.
 I
 think
 when
 people


raise
 a
 lot
 of
 funding
 early
 on,
 they


they
 think
 that
 they're
 successful
 and


they
 throw
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 at
 problems


and
 and
 think
 that
 those
 problems
 are


solved.
 But
 really
 what
 happens
 is
 those


problems
 end
 up
 doing
 and
 growing
 and


and
 they're
 still
 there.
 And
 when
 you


don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 that's
 not


something
 that
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 fall
 back


on.
 Your
 problems
 are
 very
 obvious
 and


you
 know
 if
 you
 solve
 them
 or
 if
 you


hadn't
 solved
 them.
 Eventually,
 as
 we


started
 building
 a
 track
 record
 of


showing
 real
 growth
 in
 the
 company,


investors
 started
 to
 see
 what
 was


possible.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 a
 really


exhausting
 time
 of
 course,
 but
 it


doesn't
 really
 matter.
 You
 have


problems.
 You
 have
 customers
 that
 need


things.
 You
 have
 to
 take
 one
 step
 in


front
 of
 the
 other
 just
 to
 solve


problems
 over
 time.
 Being
 a
 cockroach


where
 um
 you
 can't
 let
 anything
 kill
 you


ever.


What's
 our
 secret
 sauce?
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 our
 growth
 has
 come
 from
 building
 a


lot
 of
 products.
 No
 matter
 what
 customer


we're
 pitching
 to
 in
 the
 housing


industry,
 we
 have
 a
 product
 that
 solves


the
 problem
 that
 they
 are
 thinking
 about


today.
 So
 whether
 that's
 something
 about


their
 leasing
 process,
 whether
 it's


something
 about
 their
 maintenance


process,
 we
 have
 a
 solution
 for
 them
 and


that's
 really
 just
 come
 from
 having


really
 high
 product
 velocity
 as
 a


company.
 Another
 big
 reason
 is
 that


we've
 just
 hired
 really,
 really
 well.


I've
 spent
 most
 of
 my
 time
 focused
 on


getting
 the
 best
 and
 most
 talented


people
 I
 can
 possibly
 get.
 I


interviewed,
 personally,
 interviewed
 the


first
 400
 hires
 that
 we
 made.
 It's
 been


incredibly
 important
 to
 have
 really


strong
 people
 because
 when
 you're
 moving


so
 fast
 and
 you
 have
 so
 many
 different


products,
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 to
 make
 decisions


themselves.
 And
 you
 need
 to
 have
 really


smart
 and
 really
 hardworking
 people
 that


are
 going
 to
 move
 the
 company
 forward.


Because
 if
 you're
 moving
 quickly,
 the


CEO
 cannot
 make
 all
 the
 decisions
 for


you.
 The
 CTO
 cannot
 make
 all
 of
 the
 tech


decisions
 for
 you.
 You
 need
 everyone
 to


have
 really
 strong
 business
 acumen.
 One


of
 the
 most
 painful
 hiring
 mistakes
 I


made
 was
 probably
 around
 2021
 when
 we


were
 raising
 our
 first
 big
 round
 of


funding,
 our
 series
 B.
 And
 um
 I
 hired
 a


ton
 of
 people
 who
 were
 really
 good
 at


specialist
 roles.
 And
 the
 challenge
 I


was
 trying
 to
 solve
 was
 that
 everyone


everything
 was
 so
 chaotic.
 Every
 early


stage
 employee
 was
 working
 on
 five


different
 things
 and
 the
 constant


complaint
 was
 I
 can't
 get
 anything
 done


well
 because
 I
 keep
 switching
 context


all
 the
 time
 which
 is
 a
 very
 common


early
 stage
 company
 problem.
 And
 then
 I


decided
 to
 solve
 that
 by
 hiring
 people


who
 were
 kind
 of
 really
 good


specialists.
 So
 if
 somebody
 was
 doing


five
 things
 now
 they
 could
 pick
 the
 one


that
 they
 really
 wanted
 to
 do
 and
 then


you'd
 hire
 four
 other
 people
 that
 were


specialists.
 The
 problem
 is
 everyone


started
 losing
 the
 context.
 So
 they'd
 be


building
 really
 well
 but
 in
 five


different
 directions
 and
 the
 company
 was


not
 moving
 forward.
 We
 were
 not
 building


products
 that
 our
 customers
 cared
 about.


We
 were
 not
 selling
 products
 that
 our


customers
 cared
 about
 and
 it
 was
 just


way
 too
 early
 to
 make
 those
 types
 of


hiring
 decisions.
 So
 I
 went
 back
 to


really
 valuing
 generalist
 hires.
 And
 I


found
 that
 we
 could
 move
 a
 lot
 quicker


if
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 able
 to
 context


switch
 were
 able
 to
 have
 success
 across


many
 different
 domains,
 whether
 that
 was


sales
 or
 customer
 success.
 They
 could


think
 technically
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as


speaking
 with
 customers.
 And
 those
 ended


up
 being
 some
 of
 our
 most
 valuable
 hires


for
 a
 very
 long
 time.


When
 we
 launched
 our
 product
 with
 our


first
 national
 customer,
 we
 needed
 to


keep
 the
 service
 running
 24/7
 and
 this


was
 the
 most
 important
 deal
 of
 our


lives.
 It
 had
 to
 go
 perfectly.
 So
 Tony


and
 I
 were
 monitoring
 the
 system
 24/7


because
 we
 knew
 this
 was
 our
 shot.
 He


stayed
 up
 until
 4:00
 a.m.
 and
 I
 woke
 up


at
 4:00
 a.m.
 and
 watched
 it.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 we
 were
 building


new
 features
 with
 this
 customer.
 We
 were


trying
 to
 sell
 new
 customers.
 We
 were


trying
 to
 support
 our
 existing
 customers


and
 other
 portfolios
 that
 we
 had
 signed


on.
 So
 that
 was
 probably
 the
 most


physically
 draining
 time.
 I
 still
 work
 7


days
 a
 week
 90
 hour
 100
 hours
 is
 not


really
 sustainable.
 That's
 when
 you're


actually
 starting
 to
 eat
 into
 sleep
 and


and
 deteriorating
 over
 time.
 But
 90


hours
 is
 sustainable.
 It
 just
 means
 you


wake
 up,
 you
 go
 to
 work
 and
 you
 go
 home


and
 you
 go
 to
 sleep
 and
 you
 get
 proper


sleep
 and
 then
 you
 just
 do
 it
 again


tomorrow.
 And
 you
 do
 that
 every
 single


day.
 And
 that
 is
 how
 problems
 get


solved.
 I
 think
 that
 my
 suggestion
 for


founders
 is
 always
 if
 they're
 not


working
 7
 days
 a
 week,
 they're
 not


growing
 their
 company
 as
 fast
 as
 they


should.
 Their
 company
 is
 going
 to
 be


beaten
 by
 another
 company
 that
 is


working
 that
 their
 founders
 are
 working


7
 days
 a
 week.
 So
 that's
 just
 extra
 time


and
 effort
 that
 will
 accelerate
 the


growth
 of
 your
 company.
 If
 you
 want
 to


be
 the
 best
 company
 in
 the
 world,
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 work
 the
 hardest
 in


the
 world.
 It's
 like
 anything
 else.
 If


you
 want
 to
 be
 the
 best
 athlete,
 you


want
 to
 be
 the
 best
 musician,
 you're


practicing
 non-stop.
 Tech
 startup
 is


exactly
 the
 same
 thing.
 The
 culture
 here


is
 filled
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 just


really
 like
 solving
 hard
 problems.
 And


you're
 surrounded
 by
 so
 many
 people
 that


have
 this
 type
 of
 culture.
 There's
 this


kind
 of
 intense
 gravity
 that
 when
 you


bring
 in
 new
 people,
 they
 feel
 that


energy
 and
 they
 really
 want
 to
 meet
 that


bar.


I
 actually
 think
 that
 most
 of
 the
 next


unicorns
 will
 be
 products
 that
 are
 built


in
 unsexy
 industries.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


the
 most
 important
 problems
 that
 are


left
 to
 solve
 in
 the
 world
 are
 problems


that
 are
 typically
 deemed
 unsexy.
 If


they
 seem
 sexy,
 that
 means
 people
 are


already
 very
 excited
 about
 them
 and


they're
 already
 trying
 to
 solve
 them.


And
 so
 long
 term,
 everything
 that
 we
 try


to
 do
 in
 housing
 and
 healthcare
 is
 to


make
 these
 industries
 much
 more


financially
 stable
 and
 much
 more


attractive
 so
 that
 we
 can
 have
 more


housing
 providers
 and
 we
 can
 have
 more


healthcare
 providers
 and
 that
 serves
 all


of
 us.
 And
 we
 want
 capital
 to
 be
 put
 in


the
 most
 fundamental
 and
 important
 parts


of
 society
 that
 serve
 us
 as
 humans.
