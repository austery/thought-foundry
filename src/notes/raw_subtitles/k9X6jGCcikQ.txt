living Israeli hostages were returned in

signing ceremony to that cease fire
deal.
He says the agreement is the first step
towards stability in the region.
This is the day that people across the
region and around the world have been
working, striving, hoping and praying
for.
They have done things over the last
month that I think were really
unthinkable.
Nobody thought this could happen.
With the historic agreement we've just
signed.
Those prayers of millions have finally
been answered.
The president called it a new beginning
for the war torn region.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu skipped the peace summit in
Egypt today, but he did praise Trump
earlier while addressing the Knesset.

They are neither going to command nor
control us.
We are going to assert our sovereignty
in various ways.

He says the U.S.
will be meeting with allies this week
and expects to get substantial global
support.
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
President Anna Paulson has signaled she
favors two more quarter point interest
rate cuts this year.
Labor market risks do appear to be
increasing, not outrageously but
noticeably, and momentum seems to be
going in the wrong direction.
Against this backdrop, the FOMC decision
to cut rates by 25 basis points in
September made sense.
Over the rest of the year.
I view easing along the lines of the
medium set policy path as appropriate.
Philly Fed President Anna Paulson.
She says she expects the economy to
continue growing above trend in the
third quarter, but notes monetary policy
should consider the impact of tariffs on
consumer price increases.

And shares of Broadcom were up about
10%, the most in nearly six months after
inking a new multi-year deal with open
AI to create custom chips and networking
equipment.
Bloomberg's Caroline Hyde tells us that
deal would add ten gigawatts worth of
datacentre capacity.
Just think one gigawatt is equivalent of
one nuclear power plant.
We've got ten of those coming online by
basically 2029.
But remember, Broadcom helps them design
their own custom chips.
This is already hinted at by Hock Tan
when they had their earnings in the
beginning of September.

shutdown ends.
You've heard Chuck Schumer say
breathlessly, I just want the four
leaders to get in a back room and make a

actual negotiating table, but we won't
negotiate in smoke filled backrooms and
we won't negotiate as hostages.
House Speaker Mike Johnson.
Their subsidies are set to expire by the
end of the year.
Norwegian officials are now

into this on Friday after bets on poorly
marketed started spiking.
Hours before it was unveiled, the
Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria
machado, was awarded the 2025 prize for
fighting democracy.
