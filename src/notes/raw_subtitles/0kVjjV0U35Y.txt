Last
 week
 I
 spent
 47
 hours
 researching


tech
 ecosystem
 in
 the
 Gulf
 for
 a
 single


video.
 47
 hours.
 And
 by
 the
 end
 of
 it
 I


had
 36
 bookmarks,
 19
 PDFs
 downloaded
 to


my
 desktop
 and
 12
 videos
 saved
 on


YouTube.
 And
 that
 was
 before
 I
 started


doing
 the
 factecking
 on
 all
 the


information
 I
 found


online.
 This
 is
 the
 reality
 behind


everywhere
 to
 run
 episode.
 You
 get
 a


15-minute
 video
 about
 what's
 happening


around
 the
 world
 in
 the
 tech
 industry.


But
 what
 you
 don't
 see
 is
 me
 drowning
 in


research
 papers,
 online
 articles,


substacks,
 videos,
 Reddit
 threads
 with


conflicting
 opinions
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 if
 the
 stats
 I
 found
 are
 actually


current
 or
 from
 2019.
 And
 here's
 the


thing.
 I
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 are


dealing
 with
 this
 exact
 problem.
 It


happens
 when
 you're
 job
 hunting
 and


researching
 companies.
 It
 happens
 when


you're
 at
 school
 trying
 to
 process


massive
 amounts
 of
 information.
 It


happens
 when
 you're
 fully
 immersed
 in


your
 hobby,
 for
 example,
 music,
 and


you're
 going
 through
 music
 videos,


performers,
 sheet
 music,
 composers,
 and


what
 they're
 known
 for.
 It
 also
 happens


at
 work
 when
 you're
 doing
 market
 or


competitive
 research,
 trying
 to
 make


sense
 of
 conflicting
 numbers
 online.
 The


information
 is
 out
 there,
 but
 finding


it,
 organizing
 it,
 and
 actually
 using


it,
 that's
 where
 most
 of
 us
 fall
 apart.


The
 research
 I
 do
 is
 by
 far
 the
 most


time-conuming
 part
 of
 the
 entire
 video


creation
 process
 for
 my
 channel.
 And
 you


may
 think,
 well,
 with
 so
 many
 AI
 tools


on
 the
 market,
 what's
 so
 difficult
 about


it?
 Find
 the
 info,
 summarize
 it,
 spit
 it


out.
 Well,
 not
 quite.
 Because
 when


you're
 doing
 real
 research
 with


secondary
 data,
 meaning
 the
 data
 that


you
 did
 not
 produce
 yourself,
 you
 can't


just
 copy
 and
 paste
 random
 articles
 into


a
 chat
 and
 hope
 for
 the
 best.
 I
 need
 to


track
 where
 the
 information
 is
 coming


from,
 who
 funded
 the
 primary
 source,


whether
 the
 conclusions
 were
 made
 on
 a


representative
 sample,
 how
 the
 results


were
 measured,
 cross
 reference


conflicting
 data
 points,
 verify
 that
 the


stats
 I'm
 using
 are
 actually
 legitimate


and
 current.
 Most
 AI
 tools
 will
 give
 you


an
 answer,
 but
 they
 don't
 help
 you
 build


actual
 understanding
 or
 keep
 track
 of


how
 different
 pieces
 of
 information
 work


together.
 So,
 despite
 the
 availability


of
 AI,
 I
 spend
 lots
 of
 time
 reading


every
 piece
 of
 content
 I
 get
 my


information
 from.
 So,
 when
 this
 company,


Recall,
 reached
 out,
 I
 was
 honestly


skeptical,
 another
 AI
 productivity
 app.


But
 after
 actually
 putting
 it
 through


its
 paces
 on
 my
 Switzerland
 video


research,
 I
 realized
 that
 it
 tackles
 the


exact
 problems
 I
 just
 described.
 And
 for


full
 transparency,
 they're
 sponsoring


this
 video,
 but
 I'm
 only
 showing
 this
 to


you
 because
 it
 genuinely
 changed
 how
 I


work.
 Let
 me
 show
 you
 exactly
 what
 I


mean.
 Their
 browser
 extension
 is


honestly
 what
 makes
 Recall
 completely


different
 from
 everything
 else
 on
 the


market.
 While
 other
 apps
 make
 you


manually
 upload
 files,
 Recall
 captures


everything
 as
 you
 browse.
 Their
 browser


extension
 seamlessly
 integrates
 into


your
 research
 process,
 so
 you
 can
 do


research
 and
 summarization
 as
 you
 browse


the
 content
 online.
 So,
 what
 makes


Recall
 different
 from
 other
 AI


productivity
 tools?
 That
 was
 my
 exact


question,
 too.
 After
 using
 it
 for
 my


Switzerland
 video
 research,
 here's
 what


I
 found.
 It
 handles
 every
 type
 of


content
 I
 throw
 at
 it.
 PDFs,
 YouTube


videos,
 articles,
 Reddit
 threads,
 even


books.
 But
 more
 importantly,
 it
 keeps


everything
 connected
 instead
 of
 treating


each
 piece
 of
 information
 like
 it
 exists


in
 isolation.
 Let
 me
 walk
 you
 through
 my


actual
 research
 process
 and
 show
 you


where
 exactly
 it
 made
 the
 biggest


difference.
 When
 I
 start
 my
 research,


I'm
 not
 just
 looking
 for
 any


information.
 I'm
 hunting
 for
 the
 source


behind
 the
 source.
 For
 example,
 I
 found


an
 article
 about
 the
 Swiss
 job
 market


and
 Q1
 2025,
 but
 it's
 actually
 based
 on


research
 from
 ADO
 in
 partnership
 with


the
 University
 of
 Zurich.
 So,
 I
 need
 to


track
 down
 that
 original
 university


study,
 not
 just
 a
 summary
 someone
 wrote


about
 it.
 Sometimes
 I
 can't
 find
 the


original
 source,
 sometimes
 I
 can't.
 like


in
 this
 case
 where
 I'm
 stuck
 with
 a


nine-page
 summary,
 but
 you
 can
 see
 how


this
 multiplies
 quickly.
 This
 is
 just


one
 piece
 of
 research
 and
 I
 typically
 go


through
 about
 50
 resources
 per
 video.
 If


you've
 already
 started
 your
 research
 and


began
 saving
 countless
 bookmarks
 and
 now


wondering
 how
 you
 can
 port
 them
 all


over,
 Recall
 has
 got
 you
 covered.
 Simply


create
 a
 cart
 and
 click
 to
 import


bookmarks,
 and
 you
 can
 upload
 up
 to
 200


at
 a
 time.
 What's
 really
 powerful
 here


is
 that
 Recall
 doesn't
 just
 dump
 them


all
 in
 another
 list.
 It
 automatically


categorizes
 everything
 and
 creates


individual
 cards
 for
 each
 bookmark.
 That


way,
 your
 bookmarks
 become
 part
 of
 your


active
 knowledge
 system,
 searchable
 and


ready
 to
 connect
 with
 your
 other


research
 and
 notes.
 So,
 here
 is
 an


example
 of
 a
 PDF
 report
 that
 I
 found


about
 the
 Swiss
 job
 market.
 And
 now
 I


want
 to
 feed
 it
 to
 Recall.
 So,
 I'm
 going


to
 go
 ahead
 and
 create
 a
 card.
 And
 as


you
 can
 see,
 there
 are
 plenty
 of


different
 formats
 that
 I
 can
 feed
 to


Recall.
 But
 right
 now,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


ahead
 and
 upload
 the
 PDF.
 And
 I
 hit


create.
 And
 there's
 my
 card.
 So
 now
 I


have
 my
 original
 document
 on
 the
 left


and
 then
 the
 summary
 on
 the
 right.
 Now


the
 summary
 that
 you're
 seeing
 here
 is


the
 concise
 summary,
 but
 I
 can
 also
 go


ahead
 and
 create
 a
 detailed
 summary
 of


the
 exact
 same
 report.
 So
 with
 recall,
 I


can
 chat
 with
 my
 own
 document.
 And
 here


is
 an
 example
 of
 what
 I
 can
 do.
 I
 want


to
 take
 a
 closer
 look
 at
 the
 graph
 that


you're
 seeing
 on
 the
 screen.
 And
 I'm


asking
 recall
 to
 dissect
 it
 and


interpret
 the
 data
 that
 it's
 seeing.
 And


here
 is
 the
 analysis
 that
 I'm
 getting.


And
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 ahead
 and
 add
 it


to
 the
 notebook.
 Now
 the
 notebook


feature
 is
 where
 you
 can
 actually


compile
 a
 report
 based
 on
 the


information
 that
 you're
 getting.
 Recall


also
 highlights
 the
 keywords
 that
 are


being
 used
 in
 the
 document
 and
 I
 can


find
 the
 definitions
 of
 those
 words
 and


there
 is
 actually
 a
 page
 where
 I
 can


even
 add
 my
 own
 notes.
 Now
 as
 I'm


working
 on
 my
 own
 research
 summary,
 I


can
 also
 add
 some
 of
 the
 notes
 for


myself
 directly
 in
 the
 notebook
 feature.


So
 for
 example,
 I
 have
 a
 question
 about


which
 specific
 jobs
 were
 used
 for
 this


report
 and
 that
 is
 a
 separate
 to-do
 item


for
 myself.
 I'm
 going
 to
 add
 it
 as
 a


task
 for
 myself.
 I'm
 going
 to
 highlight


it
 so
 that
 I
 know
 that
 I
 need
 to
 come


back
 to
 it
 to
 refine
 my
 numbers.
 And
 you


can
 upload
 as
 many
 PDF
 documents
 as
 you


need
 and
 interact
 with
 them
 directly
 in


the
 recall
 app.
 I
 remember
 seeing
 people


on
 Reddit
 talking
 about
 cyber
 security


jobs
 in
 Switzerland
 being
 overhyped.
 But


which
 thread
 was
 that?
 So
 here's
 what
 I


started
 doing.
 I
 take
 all
 of
 these


Reddit
 discussions,
 summarize
 them
 with


recall,
 and
 then
 I
 cross-check
 the


official
 research
 against
 what
 people


who
 actually
 work
 there
 are
 saying.
 real


people,
 real
 experiences,
 not
 just


corporate
 surveys.
 So,
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 I


have
 plenty
 of
 Reddit
 threads
 open
 in
 my


browser,
 and
 now
 I
 want
 to
 summarize


every
 single
 one
 of
 them,
 stand
 what
 the


locals
 are
 saying
 about
 the
 actual
 text


scene,
 so
 that
 I
 can
 later
 compare
 it
 to


all
 the
 research
 that
 I
 am
 able
 to


produce
 based
 on
 the
 resources
 that
 I'll


find.
 But
 you
 can
 tell
 every
 single


thread
 is
 pretty
 long.
 And
 with
 the


recall
 app,
 I
 can
 summarize
 every
 thread


and
 link
 it
 to
 the
 recall
 account.
 So,


I'm
 repeating
 the
 same
 thing
 with
 every


thread
 that
 I
 look
 at.
 And
 while
 I'm


doing
 this,
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 click
 on
 the


recall
 extension
 button,
 it


automatically
 creates
 a
 card
 for
 me
 in


the
 app
 so
 that
 I
 can
 come
 back
 to
 it


whenever
 I
 want.
 And
 now
 you
 can
 see
 all


the
 threads
 that
 I
 just
 saved.
 All
 of


them
 are
 linked
 in
 the
 app.
 Every
 single


one
 has
 its
 own
 card.
 And
 I
 can
 interact


with
 every
 thread
 in
 the
 same
 way
 I


interact
 with
 the
 PDF
 document
 or
 with


the
 video
 summary.
 You
 can
 choose
 to


save
 all
 of
 your
 summarizations


automatically
 or
 keep
 the
 toggle
 off
 if


you
 need
 some
 time
 to
 make
 a
 decision


whether
 you
 want
 to
 save
 it
 or
 not.
 And


then
 there's
 also
 this
 feature
 called


augmented
 browsing.
 That's
 honestly
 a


game
 changer
 when
 you're
 deep
 in


research
 mode.
 I'll
 show
 you
 what
 I


mean.
 You
 need
 to
 turn
 this
 on
 in
 the


settings,
 but
 once
 you
 do,
 everything


stays
 local
 on
 your
 device.
 No
 data


leaves
 your
 computer,
 which
 is
 huge
 for


privacy.
 The
 first
 thing
 you're
 going
 to


need
 is
 to
 have
 the
 browser
 extension


downloaded.
 And
 then
 what
 you're
 going


to
 notice
 is
 that
 the
 next
 time
 you


start
 browsing
 any
 website,
 a
 little


widget
 starts
 to
 appear
 on
 the
 side
 of


the
 screen.
 You
 can
 choose
 to
 hide
 it


completely
 in
 the
 settings
 or
 you
 can


choose
 to
 keep
 it.
 Now
 it
 gives
 you
 an


option
 to
 jump
 straight
 to
 the
 core


functions
 that
 recall
 offers
 which
 is


the
 summary,
 the
 notebook
 function
 where


you
 can
 make
 your
 own
 notes
 using
 the


summarization
 you
 got
 or
 another
 option


is
 to
 chat
 with
 the
 content.
 But
 the


special
 thing
 about
 it
 is
 that
 it
 shows


you
 the
 number
 of
 connections
 you


already
 have
 with
 your
 existing


knowledge
 base.
 First
 of
 all,
 when
 you


first
 click
 on
 the
 connection,
 it
 gives


you
 the
 summary
 of
 the
 given
 word
 and
 it


also
 connects
 it
 to
 your
 existing


knowledge
 base.
 And
 if
 you
 click
 on
 it,


it'll
 bring
 you
 to
 the
 pages
 in
 your


knowledge
 base
 where
 you
 already
 have


this
 definition
 saved.
 Lastly,
 and
 it's


really
 important
 for
 privacy.
 The


augmented
 browsing
 is
 local
 first.


Everything
 you
 save
 stays
 local
 on
 your


device
 and
 no
 data
 will
 leave
 your


computer.
 The
 Switzerland
 video
 was


honestly
 the
 most
 challenging
 one
 in
 the


entire
 series.
 It's
 surprising
 how


little
 written
 content
 exists
 about
 the


Swiss
 tech
 scene.
 Way
 less
 than
 I


expected.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 heavily
 on


video
 content,
 which
 creates
 a


completely
 different
 research
 problem.


With
 articles,
 you
 can
 skim
 through
 and


decide
 fairly
 quickly
 whether
 it's
 worth


your
 time
 or
 not.
 With
 videos,
 you
 have


to
 actually
 watch
 them
 to
 figure
 out
 if


there
 is
 anything
 useful
 in
 there.
 A


20-minute
 conference
 talk
 may
 have
 one


relevant
 statistic
 at
 minute
 17.


Recall's
 video
 summarization
 feature


actually
 saved
 me
 hours.
 Instead
 of


spending
 hours
 on
 videos
 that
 I
 wasn't


sure
 about,
 I
 could
 get
 intelligent


summaries
 and
 then
 decide
 which
 ones


deserved
 my
 full
 attention.
 Here's
 how
 I


use
 recall
 for
 video
 summarization.
 Here


you
 can
 see
 a
 bunch
 of
 tabs
 with
 videos


about
 Switzerland's
 tech
 scene.
 As
 I


said,
 there
 is
 surprisingly
 little


content
 on
 the
 text
 scene
 specifically.


So,
 I
 have
 to
 go
 through
 a
 lot
 of
 videos


this
 time
 to
 see
 if
 there
 are
 any


insights
 that
 I
 can
 grab
 for
 my


research.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 each
 video


is
 fairly
 long.
 So
 watching
 all
 of
 them


from
 start
 to
 finish
 hoping
 to
 find
 at


least
 one
 thing
 that
 can
 be
 useful
 would


take
 me
 hours
 if
 not
 days.
 But
 with


recall
 I
 can
 get
 a
 full
 summary
 of
 each


video
 in
 a
 few
 clicks
 and
 quickly
 decide


whether
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 my
 time
 watching


the
 entire
 video
 or
 not.
 And
 as
 always,


all
 of
 this
 information
 gets
 saved
 into


a
 recall
 card
 that
 I
 can
 access
 directly


in
 the
 app
 at
 any
 time
 and
 not
 worry


about
 losing
 the
 link
 to
 the
 original


video.
 A
 few
 more
 things
 and
 how
 you
 can


work
 with
 video
 summarization.
 When
 you


open
 the
 video
 and
 click
 on
 the
 browser


extension
 button,
 as
 always,
 you
 will


get
 the
 transcript
 under
 the
 reader
 tab.


But
 on
 top
 of
 the
 transcript,
 you
 can


skip
 to
 any
 part
 of
 the
 video
 by


clicking
 on
 the
 time
 code
 just
 like


this.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 it
 takes
 me


straight
 to
 the
 exact
 moment
 where
 this


information
 is
 mentioned.
 Now,
 I'm


looking
 at
 the
 detailed
 summary
 here.


And
 I
 notice
 something
 that
 catches
 my


attention.
 So,
 I
 decide
 to
 ask
 a


follow-up
 question.
 And
 there's
 my


answer.
 And
 this
 is
 definitely
 something


that
 I'll
 want
 to
 include
 as
 a
 data


point
 in
 my
 script.
 So,
 now
 I'm
 going
 to


copy
 this
 into
 my
 notebook,
 highlight


the
 most
 important
 fact,
 and
 add
 my
 own


notes.
 Now
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 make
 sure


that
 there
 is
 a
 card
 associated
 with


this
 video
 in
 the
 recall
 app.
 And
 there


it
 is
 along
 with
 my
 notes.
 So
 now
 I'm


back
 in
 the
 app
 with
 everything.
 PDFs,


articles,
 video
 summaries,
 Reddit


discussions,
 all
 in
 one
 place.
 But
 it's


not
 just
 a
 dump
 of
 information.
 There
 is


this
 graph
 view
 that
 actually
 maps
 out


how
 different
 topics
 connect
 to
 each


other.
 I
 can
 see
 the
 relationships


between
 salary
 data,
 cost
 of
 living,


cities,
 topics
 that
 I
 might
 have
 missed


while
 looking
 at
 sources
 individually.


There's
 also
 this
 feature
 called
 graph,


which
 is
 the
 visual
 representation
 of


all
 connections
 between
 the
 content
 that


you
 saved.
 It
 shows
 key
 terms
 that


connect
 all
 of
 your
 notes
 together,
 and


you
 can
 jump
 from
 one
 subtopic
 to


another
 while
 staying
 focused
 on
 the


topic
 you're
 researching.
 When
 I'm


putting
 together
 content
 for
 the
 video,


this
 is
 where
 everything
 comes
 together.


I'm
 not
 just
 copying
 and
 pasting.
 I'm


cross-referencing
 data
 points,
 checking


that
 my
 statistics
 are
 actually
 saying


what
 I
 think
 they're
 saying.
 When
 I
 make


claims
 like
 cyber
 security
 salaries


increase
 15%
 year-over-year,
 I
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 I'm
 using
 the
 right


baseline
 and
 the
 right
 time
 frame.
 The


connections
 feature
 lets
 me
 trace
 back


through
 everything
 I
 found
 on
 a
 given


topic.
 Now,
 I've
 been
 talking
 about
 this


from
 a
 content
 creator
 perspective,
 but


the
 more
 I
 use
 recall,
 the
 more
 I


realize
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 research


tool.
 In
 my
 professional
 life
 as
 a


product
 manager
 trying
 to
 understand
 the


competitive
 landscape,
 I
 am
 dealing
 with


the
 exact
 same
 problem.
 scattered


information
 across
 analyst
 reports,


competitor
 websites,
 customer
 feedback,


and
 industry
 publications.
 Same
 thing
 if


you're
 in
 marketing,
 for example,
 doing


market
 research.
 You've
 got
 survey
 data,


social
 media
 sentiment,
 industry


reports,
 competitor
 campaigns,
 and
 these


different
 types
 of
 content
 that
 need
 to


be
 synthesized
 into
 actionable
 insights.


The
 tool
 handles
 all
 of
 it
 in
 the
 same


way,
 whether
 it's
 a
 PDF
 from
 Gardner
 or


a
 Twitter
 thread
 from
 industry
 experts.


Now,
 recall
 also
 has
 this
 great
 feature


that
 helps
 you
 retain
 the
 information


you
 learned.
 This
 comes
 in
 really
 handy


if
 you're
 preparing
 for
 a
 test
 or
 an


exam.
 In
 fact,
 it's
 a
 fantastic
 app
 for


everything
 education
 related
 when
 you


have
 to
 process
 record
 amount
 of


information
 in
 the
 smallest
 period
 of


time
 and
 be
 able
 to
 retain
 it
 so
 that


you
 do
 well
 on
 a
 test.
 To
 make
 use
 of


the
 quiz
 function,
 all
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is


just
 come
 back
 to
 your
 recall
 card
 and


navigate
 to
 the
 quiz
 tab
 and
 click


generate
 questions
 and
 it
 will


automatically
 create
 questions
 based
 on


the
 content
 of
 the
 card
 to
 test
 your


knowledge.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 it


automatically
 connects
 to
 a
 larger


feature
 called
 review.
 The
 review


feature
 tests
 you
 on
 all
 the
 content
 you


wish
 to
 be
 tested
 on.
 The
 feature
 is


based
 on
 active
 learning
 techniques
 and


repetition
 to
 help
 you
 retain
 the


information
 you
 need
 the
 most.
 The
 more


questions
 you
 get
 correct,
 the
 less
 you


see
 them.
 The
 more
 you
 get
 wrong,
 the


more
 it
 starts
 popping
 up.
 So,
 like
 I


said
 before,
 the
 more
 you
 use
 the
 app,


the
 more
 personalized
 it
 becomes
 to
 help


you
 get
 the
 most
 out
 of
 your
 research


and
 lock
 it
 in
 your
 long-term
 memory.


Before
 this,
 I
 was
 drowning
 in
 bookmarks


that
 I'd
 save
 and
 later
 think,
 why
 did
 I


save
 this?
 And
 copying
 links
 into
 my


notes
 without
 remembering
 what
 I
 needed


them
 for.
 Now
 I
 have
 one
 place
 where
 I


can
 not
 only
 store
 everything,
 but


actually
 interact
 with
 the
 connected


knowledge
 base.
 So
 that's
 the
 real
 value


of
 this
 app,
 turning
 information


overload
 into
 actual
 understanding.


Whether
 you're
 job
 hunting,
 studying
 for


exams,
 building
 a
 business,
 or
 just


trying
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 complex
 topics,


the
 problem
 is
 always
 the
 same.
 too
 much


scattered
 information,
 not
 enough


connection
 between
 the
 pieces.
 If
 you're


wondering
 how
 recall
 compares
 to


Notebook
 LM
 or
 YouTube
 Premium,
 here's


the
 difference.
 Notebook
 LM
 is
 a


research
 tool,
 while
 Recall
 is
 a


personal
 knowledge
 base
 for
 all
 of
 your


content
 from
 books,
 movies,
 recipes,


personal
 notes,
 videos,
 and
 blogs
 that


links
 everything
 together.
 Recall's


browser
 extension
 is
 what
 makes
 Recall


truly
 powerful.
 You
 have
 a
 seamless


workflow
 between
 research
 and
 browsing.


And
 augmented
 browsing
 is
 something
 that


no
 competitor
 has.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


video
 summarization,
 Recall
 works
 with


all
 sources,
 not
 just
 YouTube,
 so
 you


don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 which
 platform


you're
 browsing.
 Recall
 works
 with


everything.
 I've
 put
 the
 link
 to
 the
 app


in
 the
 description.
 The
 free
 version


will
 show
 you
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about.


You
 can
 test
 it
 with
 your
 own
 research


process
 and
 see
 if
 it
 clicks.
 But
 if


your
 time
 really
 matters
 to
 you
 and


you're
 the
 type
 of
 person
 who
 really


cares
 about
 getting
 to
 the
 truth
 instead


of
 just
 skipping
 services,
 the
 paid


version
 is
 well
 worth
 it.
 It's
 very


affordable
 and
 it
 lets
 you
 do
 unlimited


research
 on
 any
 topic
 you'd
 like.
 The


company
 also
 makes
 constant
 updates
 to


the
 app
 and
 releases
 new
 features.
 Regal


works
 both
 as
 a
 website
 and
 a
 mobile
 app


and
 you
 can
 capture
 ideas
 and
 sources


wherever
 you
 are.
 Your
 knowledge
 base


syncs
 across
 everything.
 The
 team
 behind


it
 is
 also
 very
 open
 to
 feedback
 and


feature
 requests.
 And
 you
 can
 find
 a


dedicated
 space
 for
 all
 things
 feedback


at


feedback.recall.ai.

 And
 if
 you

 you'll

 And
 hurry
 up,
 the

 valid

 2025.


You're
 already
 doing
 the
 hard
 work
 of


finding
 great
 information.
 The
 real


problem
 is
 remembering
 where
 you
 found


it
 6
 months
 later
 or
 realizing
 how
 it


connects
 to
 something
 you
 learned


yesterday.
 When
 your
 knowledge
 base


starts
 organizing
 itself
 and
 making


those
 connections
 automatically,
 that's


when
 research
 actually
 becomes
 useful


instead
 of
 overwhelming.
 Huge
 thanks
 to


Recall
 for
 sponsoring
 this
 video.
 I


absolutely
 enjoyed
 using
 your
 product


and
 will
 definitely
 use
 it
 for
 all
 of
 my


future
 videos.
 As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this


was
 helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.
