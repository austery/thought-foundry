Hi,
 David.


>> Great
 to
 be
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 for
 being
 with
 us.
 And
 and


and
 first
 um
 congratulations
 on
 uh
 the


Nobel
 Prize.
 I
 I
 I
 know
 that
 um
 all
 of


us
 at
 TED
 were
 really
 elated
 to
 see
 uh


your
 work
 celebrated
 and
 recognized
 in


in
 that
 major
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 in
 fact,
 much
 of
 the
 work
 that


I
 talked
 about
 in
 my
 uh
 Nobel
 Prize


address
 was
 supported
 by
 the
 TED


Audacious
 project.
 So
 I'm
 grateful,
 very


grateful
 to
 Ted
 as
 well.
 I'm
 excited
 to


be
 back
 here.


>> It's
 definitely
 meaningful
 that
 TED


could
 be
 part
 of
 uh
 your
 journey
 in
 that


in
 that
 really
 important
 way
 and
 part
 of


this
 important
 work.
 And
 we
 definitely


want
 to
 get
 into
 all
 of
 that.
 Um
 but
 uh


before
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 and


sort
 of
 where
 things
 have
 gone
 since
 uh


2019
 when
 you
 joined
 us
 um
 as
 a
 speaker


and
 and
 as
 an
 audacious
 grantee
 uh
 I


think
 it
 would
 be
 helpful
 to
 sort
 of
 set


the
 stage
 with
 uh
 some
 background
 on


your
 work
 sort
 of
 detailing
 the
 the


science
 that
 uh
 was
 recognized
 here
 um


connected
 to
 proteins.
 So
 uh
 so
 you've


you've
 referred
 to
 proteins
 as
 the
 workh


horses
 of
 all
 living
 things.
 Um
 you
 said


in
 your
 talk
 in
 fact
 that
 almost


everything
 that
 happens
 in
 biology


happens
 because
 of
 proteins.
 They
 do


everything
 from
 transporting
 nutrients


to
 repairing
 damaged
 tissue
 to


supporting
 our
 immune
 system.
 Um
 and


your
 work
 of
 course
 has
 been
 focused


around
 creating
 new
 proteins.
 Why
 has


this
 been
 such
 a
 challenging
 thing
 for


humanity
 to
 accomplish?


Well,
 for
 many
 many
 years,
 scientists


studied
 the
 proteins
 that
 exist
 in


nature,
 and
 they
 um
 I
 think
 they
 they


seemed
 almost
 like
 these
 sort
 of
 magical


elephant
 runes
 passed
 down
 from,
 you


know,
 billions
 of
 years
 of
 evolution.


There
 was
 they
 were
 really
 special.


They're
 very
 different
 from
 anything


that
 occurs
 in
 the
 outside
 of
 biology


because
 they
 have
 these
 very
 precise


properties.
 they
 have
 these
 exquisite


functions
 and
 so
 the
 notion
 that
 you


could
 design
 new
 ones
 that
 would
 do
 new


things
 was
 really
 quite
 foreign.
 Uh
 and


when
 people
 tried
 to
 do
 it
 it
 was
 um
 it


it
 it
 was
 very
 it
 was
 very
 difficult.
 So


uh
 it
 was
 both
 that
 they
 seemed
 almost


unattainable
 and
 that
 the
 attempts
 that


were
 made
 were
 not
 successful
 and
 that


even
 thinking
 about
 the
 methods
 for
 even


how
 you
 would
 go
 about
 designing
 a


protein
 with
 the
 new
 function
 didn't


really
 exist.
 Um
 so
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 there


were
 there
 were
 a
 number
 of
 reasons
 why


it
 it
 didn't
 happen
 you
 know
 a
 much


longer
 time
 ago.


And
 of
 of
 course
 the
 the
 groundbreaking


thing
 that
 you've
 done,
 the
 Nobel
 Prize


winning
 thing
 that
 you've
 done
 is
 um
 is


using
 a
 computer
 program
 to
 design


proteins
 from
 scratch.
 Can
 you
 talk


about
 how
 exactly
 you
 did
 this?


>> Yes.
 And
 in
 fact,
 there's
 been
 a
 very


big
 uh
 uh
 transition
 between
 2019
 when
 I


gave
 the
 TED
 talk
 and
 today.
 So
 we
 began


quite
 a
 few
 years
 ago


to
 try
 to
 understand
 how
 the
 amino
 acid


sequences
 of
 proteins
 determine
 their


three-dimensional
 structures.
 And
 just


as
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of
 of
 background
 for


um
 so
 everyone's
 on
 the
 same
 page.
 The


genes
 in
 our
 genomes
 each
 encode
 a


protein.
 That's
 what
 they
 do.
 And
 the


way
 they
 encode
 that
 protein
 is
 by


specifying
 the
 sequence
 of
 amino
 acids


in
 the
 protein.
 And
 once
 that
 sequence


is
 known,
 then
 that
 specifies
 what
 the


three-dimensional
 structure
 is.
 And
 so


when
 I
 first
 began
 um
 at
 the
 University


of
 Washington,
 we
 studied
 how
 proteins


actually
 fold
 up
 from
 their
 amino
 acid


sequences
 to
 their
 threedimensional


structures.
 And
 we
 studed
 studied
 that


experimentally.
 And
 as
 we
 began
 to
 learn


more
 and
 more,
 we
 um
 we
 developed


computer
 programs
 to
 to
 mimic
 that


process
 and
 to
 try
 to
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to


go
 from
 take
 a
 sequence
 and
 predict
 the


structure.
 And
 then
 after
 we
 had
 been


doing
 that
 for
 some
 time,
 uh
 we
 realized


that
 we
 could
 go
 backwards,
 not
 go
 from


like
 in
 biology
 from
 the
 sequence
 to
 the


structure
 and
 the
 function
 of
 the


protein,
 but
 instead
 start
 with
 a
 new


structure
 and
 a
 new
 function
 that
 don't


exist
 and
 work
 backwards
 towards
 to
 an


amino
 acid
 sequence
 that
 would
 encode


that
 new
 protein.
 The
 difference
 is
 that


in
 the
 biology
 case
 there,
 the
 proteins


are
 encoded
 in
 the
 genes
 in
 our
 genomes


and
 the
 genes
 of
 all
 living
 things.
 In


the
 design
 case,
 it's
 a
 completely
 new


protein.
 So,
 it
 doesn't
 exist.
 There's


no
 gene
 that
 exists.
 So,
 we
 have
 to
 make


a
 synthetic
 gene,
 a
 synthetic
 piece
 of


DNA
 that
 encodes
 this
 new
 protein.
 Once


we
 have
 that
 synthetic
 piece
 of
 DNA,
 we


can
 put
 it
 into
 a
 bacterium
 and
 it
 will


produce
 the
 protein
 and
 we
 can
 see


whether
 it
 actually
 does
 what
 we


designed
 it
 to
 do.
 So
 the
 first
 class
 of


models
 we
 developed
 were
 traditional


physical
 models
 where
 we
 sort
 of
 tried


to
 describe
 all
 the
 interactions
 between


all
 the
 atoms
 in
 the
 protein
 and
 um
 how


those
 interactions
 guide
 the
 protein
 to


fold
 up
 and
 we
 might
 made
 quite
 a
 bit
 of


progress
 which
 I
 described
 some
 of
 which


I
 briefly
 described
 in
 my
 2019
 talk.
 Now


since
 then
 we've
 completely
 switched


over
 to
 developing
 AI
 based
 methods
 for


protein
 design
 and
 in
 these
 methods
 we


um
 we
 take
 the
 many
 many
 examples
 of


protein
 structures
 which
 have
 whose


struct
 proteins
 whose
 structures
 have


been
 determined
 by
 uh
 scientists
 really


over
 the
 last
 50
 years
 and
 there
 are


about
 250,000
 of
 these
 structures
 now


and
 so
 we
 can
 learn
 by
 training
 AI


models
 on
 these
 structures.
 We
 can


develop
 methods
 that
 actually
 will


generate
 new
 proteins
 with
 new


structures
 and
 we
 can
 condition
 this


process
 on
 the
 on
 a
 specification
 of
 the


function
 we
 want
 to
 create.
 So
 for


example
 with
 and
 and
 our
 methods
 are
 are


very
 similar
 to
 image
 generation


methods.
 So
 whereas
 you
 might
 say
 um
 to


Dolly
 or
 an
 image
 image
 generation


program
 uh
 generate
 an
 image
 of
 a


giraffe
 walking
 on
 a
 horse
 or
 something


absurd
 like
 that
 and
 you
 would
 get
 an


image
 something
 like
 that
 that


represents
 that.
 In
 the
 same
 way
 we
 can


um
 specify
 to
 RF
 diffusion
 the
 design


protein
 program
 we
 have
 uh
 created.
 We


can
 say
 design
 a
 protein
 which
 binds
 to


this
 virus
 and
 blocks
 it
 or
 binds
 to


this
 cancer
 cell
 and
 stops
 it
 from


dividing
 and
 the
 program
 will
 generate
 a


new
 protein
 and
 then
 we
 make
 it
 in
 the


lab
 and
 see
 whether
 it
 actually
 does


what
 we
 designed
 it
 to
 do.


It's
 incredible
 and
 and
 it
 seems
 like


there
 are
 seemingly
 endless
 applications


for
 this
 and
 in
 2019
 you
 shared
 a
 few
 of


them
 and
 I'd
 love
 to
 to
 talk
 about
 about


those
 um
 that
 you
 shared
 in
 that
 talk


but
 also
 am
 really
 curious
 to
 know
 what


excites
 you
 today
 when
 you
 think
 about


applications
 for
 for
 this.


>> Yes.
 So
 many
 of
 the
 grand
 challenges


that
 I
 described
 in
 my
 2019
 talk,
 we've


we've
 really
 made
 huge
 progress
 on
 and


now
 gone
 beyond.
 Um
 but
 I'll
 highlight


one
 example.
 I
 spoke
 about
 vaccines
 and


um
 during
 the
 pandemic
 uh
 my
 colleague


Neil
 King
 here
 at
 the
 Institute
 for


Protein
 Design
 actually
 developed
 a


vaccine
 for
 COVID
 which
 um
 is
 approved


for
 use
 in
 humans.
 It's
 the
 first
 denovo


design
 medicine
 and
 he's
 well
 on
 his
 way


to
 making
 advanced
 vaccines
 for
 many
 um


different
 viruses
 including
 influenza.


Since
 2019,
 we've
 gotten
 into
 as
 as
 the


methods
 we've
 developed
 have
 become
 more


powerful,
 we've
 expanded
 the
 range
 of


applications
 quite
 a
 bit
 more
 broadly.


Um
 for
 example,
 sustainability
 is
 a
 new


emphasis.
 So,
 we're
 working
 on
 new


proteins
 to
 break
 down
 plastic
 and
 other


other
 pollutants
 and
 polymers.
 We're


working
 on
 new
 ways
 to
 fix
 carbon
 and


remove
 uh
 methane
 from
 the
 atmosphere.


And
 we're
 working
 on
 green
 chemistry


approaches
 to
 enable
 the
 synthesis


creation
 of
 molecules
 without
 using


toxic
 solvents
 and
 um
 in
 much
 lower


energy
 uh
 ways.
 So
 the
 that
 the
 grand


challenges
 seem
 very
 ambitious
 at
 the


time,
 but
 as
 the
 methods
 have
 progressed


and
 with
 all
 the
 brilliant
 people
 who


have
 come
 here
 to
 work
 on
 solving
 them,


we've
 actually
 been
 able
 to
 go
 well


beyond
 now
 and
 tackle
 new
 problems
 as


well.


>> It's
 incredible
 and
 it
 it
 seems
 exciting


to
 think
 about
 all
 the
 ways
 that
 this


could
 improve
 life
 for
 for
 really
 all
 of


us
 in
 in
 different
 ways.
 and
 and
 you


mentioned
 the
 sustainability
 work
 which


was
 something
 that
 you
 touched
 on
 very


very
 slightly
 in
 your
 2019
 talk
 and
 it


sounds
 like
 that's
 really
 ramped
 up
 uh


since
 then.
 How
 did
 you
 begin
 to
 think


about
 sustainability
 work
 as
 a
 potential


use
 case
 for
 this?


One
 of
 the
 advances
 that
 we've
 made


since
 2019


is
 in
 developing
 methods
 for
 for


designing
 proteins
 which
 can
 make
 or


break
 chemical
 bonds.
 This
 is
 something


that
 happens
 in
 in
 nature.
 There
 are


many
 proteins
 which
 do
 this
 which


catalyze
 chemical
 reactions.
 And
 now


that
 um
 we've
 we've
 mastered
 that
 we
 can


that
 we
 can
 design
 proteins
 that
 will


break
 bonds.
 problems
 like
 plastic


degradation
 or
 breaking
 down
 other
 toxic


compounds
 in
 the
 environment
 uh
 become


really
 they
 start
 to
 becoming
 things


that
 can
 be
 approached
 and
 it's


particularly
 interesting
 with
 compounds


that
 that
 weren't
 present
 during


evolution
 like
 forever
 comp
 forever


chemicals
 pas
 compounds
 there
 was
 never


any
 evolutionary
 pressure
 for
 nature
 to


develop
 um
 to
 evolve
 proteins
 to
 break


down
 such
 compounds
 and
 Uh
 so
 there's
 a


lot
 so
 so
 there
 are
 many
 problems
 we


face
 today
 and
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 general


theme
 in
 in
 places
 where
 nature
 was


already
 trying
 to
 optimize
 heavily
 to


solve
 a
 certain
 problem
 there's
 not


really
 a
 need
 for
 us
 to
 design
 new


proteins
 but
 in
 areas
 where
 um
 either


because
 we
 live
 longer
 so
 things
 like


neurodeeneration
 are
 more
 of
 a
 problem


or
 because
 we're
 putting
 new
 things
 in


the
 environment
 like
 plastic
 or
 PAS


compounds
 uh
 those
 are
 the
 places
 where


there's
 a
 huge
 opportunity
 for
 protein


design
 because
 we
 already
 know
 from


nature
 that
 uh
 proteins
 can
 solve
 a


really
 can
 solve
 almost
 any
 problem.
 And


so
 for
 protein
 design
 it's
 the
 problems


that
 nature
 didn't
 have
 to
 deal
 with


because
 you
 know
 humans
 didn't
 you
 know


people
 didn't
 live
 as
 long
 or
 because
 uh


they
 hadn't
 polluted
 or
 heated
 up
 the


planet
 for
 example.
 Well,
 it
 seems
 like


that
 work
 is
 is
 obviously
 very
 necessary


and
 I'm
 interested
 to
 also
 hear
 what


other
 sorts
 of
 uses
 have
 revealed


themselves
 in
 the
 years
 um
 since
 you


joined
 us.
 It
 seems
 like
 sustainability


of
 course,
 health,
 medicine.
 What
 other


areas
 um
 have
 been
 sort
 of
 surprising


places
 that
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 to
 find


protein
 design
 can
 be
 helpful?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 one
 area
 that's
 related
 to


sustainability
 is
 um
 that
 that's
 also


become
 more
 pressing
 since
 2019
 is


trying
 to
 design
 to
 make
 crop
 plants


more
 thermo
 tolerant
 because
 you
 know


temperatures
 are
 rising
 and
 it's
 very


important
 that
 major
 crops
 like
 rice
 be


able
 to
 grow
 and
 um
 uh
 thrive
 at
 at


higher
 temperatures.
 And
 so
 the
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 we've
 been
 become
 very


good
 at
 with
 protein
 design
 is
 to
 make


proteins
 more
 stable.
 So,
 we're
 excited


now
 about
 applying
 those
 methods
 to
 to


problems
 like
 uh
 uh
 making
 plants
 um
 uh


thrive
 at
 higher
 temperatures.
 In
 other


other
 areas
 are
 um
 in
 technology,
 we're


very
 excited
 about
 um
 sensing
 and
 sort


of
 intrigued
 by,
 you
 know,
 the
 ability


of
 a
 human
 or
 a
 dog
 to
 smell
 and


distinguish
 between
 many
 many
 different


compounds.
 So
 that
 the
 way
 that
 a
 dog


does
 that
 with
 um
 is
 with
 um
 proteins,


receptors
 in
 its
 nose
 that
 can
 respond


differentially
 to
 different
 compounds


that
 are
 in
 the
 environment.
 And
 we


we're
 now
 designing
 uh
 synthetic


proteins
 that
 can
 respond
 to
 many
 many


different
 molecules
 and
 uh
 so
 we're
 very


excited
 about
 building
 things
 like
 an


artificial
 nose.
 um
 towards
 that
 end
 and


um
 for
 more
 general
 technology


applications,
 we're
 learning
 how
 to


interface
 proteins
 with
 um
 electronics


because
 then
 you
 can
 have
 a
 more
 direct


coupling
 of
 a
 readout
 from
 a
 designed


protein
 to
 something
 that
 we
 can
 um


quickly
 um
 read
 out
 on
 a
 cell
 phone
 for


example.
 And
 one
 example
 of
 that
 is
 um


our
 we're
 designing
 um
 proteins
 to
 sense


um
 compounds
 in
 the
 environment
 that
 are


embedded
 would
 be
 embedded
 directly
 in


silicon
 nitride
 chips.
 And
 that's
 again


a
 problem
 that
 nature
 never
 had
 to
 deal


with
 because
 uh
 proteins
 in
 nature
 were


never
 interfacing
 with
 you
 know
 with


electronic
 devices.
 Um
 and
 we've
 made


quite
 a
 bit
 of
 progress
 there.
 How
 do
 we


ensure
 and
 and
 what
 role
 do
 you
 see


yourself
 playing
 in
 in
 ensuring
 that


that
 what
 you're
 creating
 is
 accessible


and
 available
 to
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 people?


>> Yes,
 I
 think
 we
 we
 start
 off
 on
 um
 with


the
 methods
 we
 develop.
 we
 make
 those
 uh


widely
 available
 and
 um
 so
 that's
 start


we're
 particularly
 interested
 in


enabling
 protein
 design
 in
 in
 countries


where
 there
 isn't
 as
 much
 um
 you
 know


advanced
 infrastructure
 for
 you
 know


largecale


drug
 screening
 for
 example
 because
 with


protein
 design
 really
 cuts
 down
 the
 cost


in
 making
 uh
 proteins
 that
 to
 deal
 with


uh
 with
 a
 with
 a
 challenge
 for
 example


if
 you
 are
 a
 farmer
 in
 um
 in
 Africa
 for


example
 example,
 and
 you're
 dealing
 with


a
 new
 type
 of
 of
 pest,
 say
 a
 fungus
 or


an
 insect.
 Um,
 we
 want
 to
 empower


scientists
 and
 researchers
 in
 the


country
 that
 has
 the
 problem
 to
 actually


use
 our
 methods
 to
 develop
 uh
 their


their
 own
 solutions
 to
 those
 problems,


which
 may
 be
 pretty
 local.
 Um
 as
 things


um
 as
 things
 uh
 come
 out
 of
 here
 uh
 the


um


we
 um
 well
 we
 work
 u
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 do
 is
 we
 when
 we
 license
 um
 uh


things
 that
 we
 have
 created
 uh
 to
 um
 to


other
 entities
 we
 always
 require
 that
 uh


there
 be
 a
 um
 a
 carveout
 for
 um
 for


global
 health
 applications
 and
 that's


something
 that
 the
 the
 Gates
 Foundation


is


um
 uh
 pioneered
 and
 so
 we
 try
 in
 every


way
 we
 can
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 things
 we


develop
 will
 be
 as
 broadly
 applicable
 as


as
 possible.
 Um
 I
 think
 you
 know
 it's
 a


challenge
 currently
 that
 goes
 well


beyond
 protein
 design
 to
 um
 to
 to


motivate
 the
 the
 world
 to
 put
 the


resources
 into
 ways
 of
 combating
 things


like
 you
 know
 global
 warming
 and
 um
 uh


and
 you
 know
 the
 accumulating
 plastic
 um


it's
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 but
 it's


going
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 resources
 too
 and


we
 can't
 really
 control
 that.
 I'll
 give


you
 an
 example
 of
 something
 that
 I
 am


disappointed
 in.
 During
 the
 pandemic,


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 talk
 about
 how
 we


needed
 better
 methods
 for
 rapidly


creating
 ways
 to
 deal
 with
 pandemic
 uh


viruses.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and
 immediately
 after


the
 pandemic
 or
 during
 during
 the
 end
 of


the
 p pandemic,
 there
 were
 even
 some


initiatives
 started
 to
 work
 on
 sort
 of


faster
 approaches
 to
 um
 develop
 u
 uh


ways
 to
 protect
 against
 new
 pathogens
 if


they
 emerged.
 But
 within
 six
 months
 of


the
 pandemic
 ending,
 the
 the
 world
 kind


of
 forgot
 about
 it.
 So
 um
 the
 the
 um
 so


there
 are
 there
 are
 some
 issues
 with
 the


sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 the


way
 that
 the
 the
 the
 pull
 from
 the


outside
 world
 in
 different
 areas
 is


different
 depending
 on
 how
 much
 profit


can
 be
 made
 which
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 too


bad.


>> So
 keeping
 people's
 attention
 focused
 on


this
 is
 yeah
 uh
 the
 seems
 like
 the
 the


challenge
 of
 of
 of
 your
 work.
 Um,
 well,


I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 a
 really
 nice
 segue


to
 talking
 about
 the
 Nobel
 Prize,
 which


is
 a
 great
 way
 to
 sort
 of
 put
 focus
 on


this
 incredible
 work
 you're
 doing.
 Uh,


so
 late
 last
 year,
 of
 course,
 you
 get


word
 uh
 that
 you've
 been
 awarded
 uh the


Nobel
 Prize
 in
 chemistry.
 Can
 you
 tell


us
 about
 how
 you
 received
 this
 news
 and


what
 that
 um
 experience
 was
 like?
 Yeah.


Well,
 it
 was
 very
 exciting
 and
 um
 um
 got


the
 phone
 call
 and
 then
 I
 think
 what
 I


remember
 uh
 the
 most
 that
 day
 was
 um
 uh


when
 I
 came
 into
 um
 the
 lab
 and
 we
 had


this
 huge
 party
 here
 and
 um
 that
 was


really
 really
 special.
 And
 then
 in


Stockholm
 that
 um
 I
 think
 we
 um
 I
 I


really
 felt
 that
 the
 work
 that
 the
 prize


was
 a
 celebration
 of
 the
 work
 of
 you


know
 the
 many
 people
 the
 many
 brilliant


students
 and
 postocs
 and
 others
 I've
 had


over
 the
 years
 who
 uh
 contribute
 to
 all


the
 things
 that
 you
 know
 end
 up
 going


into
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 winning
 work
 and


that
 I
 actually
 talked
 about
 in
 my
 talk


and
 so
 I
 want
 to
 we
 we
 asked
 people
 uh


to
 former
 colleagues
 to
 come
 and
 then
 I


think
 we
 actually
 set
 a
 record
 there


185
 people
 who
 um
 uh
 who
 came
 you
 know


uh
 who
 former
 colleagues,
 former


graduate
 students
 and
 postocs,
 mostly


former
 almost
 all
 actually
 former


trainees
 at
 one
 level
 or
 another
 at


different
 times
 and
 um
 uh
 that
 was


really
 special.
 I
 think
 we
 we
 we
 set
 a


record
 and
 this
 really
 hit
 home
 to
 me
 um


when
 I
 uh
 gave
 my
 talk
 uh
 my
 Nobel


speech
 and
 then
 uh
 you
 know
 when
 you're


up
 there
 on
 stage
 you
 can't
 really
 see


who's
 on
 the
 audience
 and
 then
 when
 the


late
 lights
 came
 on
 I
 saw
 that
 there
 was


a
 quarter
 of
 the
 room
 the
 whole
 there


was
 this
 whole
 big
 section
 which
 were


all
 former
 graduates
 and
 postocs
 from


you
 know
 many
 years
 back
 up
 till
 the


current
 and
 that
 was
 really
 really


special
 and
 um
 I
 think
 it
 made
 it
 clear


to
 me
 or
 I
 guess
 I'd
 always
 known
 it
 but


I
 was
 really
 impressed
 upon
 the
 that
 you


know
 for
 me
 really
 you
 know
 the


scientific
 advances
 are
 one
 thing
 but


really
 training
 and
 mentoring
 all
 these


amazing
 people
 or
 going
 on
 to
 do
 all


these
 really
 amazing
 things
 is
 really
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 the
 most
 important


thing
 I
 do
 and
 um
 uh
 and
 so
 anyway
 that


that
 and
 then
 in
 Stockholm
 we
 had
 a


number
 of
 really
 fantastic
 parties
 with


you
 know
 all
 these
 185
 people
 including


you
 know
 family
 and
 extended
 family
 and


it
 was
 it
 was
 really
 wonderful.


>> That's
 great.
 Um
 well
 David
 I
 don't


think
 you'll
 be
 surprised
 to
 know
 that


we're
 getting
 tons
 of
 questions
 uh
 from


the
 member
 community
 and
 so
 I
 I
 want
 to


start
 to
 bring
 some
 of
 those
 to
 you
 uh


to
 integrate
 into
 the
 conversation.
 Uh


we
 have
 one
 from
 Les
 B
 uh
 who
 asks
 how


do
 you
 see
 technologies
 like
 crisper
 and


gene
 editing
 intersecting
 with
 your


AIdriven
 protein
 design?
 Could
 combining


these
 tools
 accelerate
 the
 development


of
 targeted
 therapies
 or
 sustainable


biological
 solutions?


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 a
 wonderful
 it's
 a
 great


question.
 Um
 yesterday
 I
 had
 a
 very
 long


conversation
 with
 the
 world's
 experts
 at


Chrisper
 um
 uh
 in
 uh
 Jennifer
 Dana's


institute
 at
 Berkeley
 and
 we're
 going
 to


we're
 going
 to
 join
 forces
 just
 as
 um
 uh


uh
 uh
 suggested
 by
 that
 question
 um
 for


the
 problem
 of
 sustainable
 agriculture.


We
 can
 design
 new
 proteins
 but
 then
 they


have
 to
 get
 into
 the
 plants
 and
 um
 so
 we


can
 improve
 say
 plant
 thermal
 tolerance


um
 uh
 we
 can
 we
 can
 design
 proteins
 that


in
 principle
 could
 in
 plant
 improve


plant
 thermal
 tolerance
 or
 or
 um
 uh


protect
 against
 uh
 uh
 uh
 funguses
 like


wheat
 blight
 but
 we
 need
 to
 get
 the


proteins
 in
 and
 uh
 crisper
 and
 uh
 the


IGI
 are
 really
 experts
 at
 that
 so
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 perfect
 time
 to
 partner


in
 many
 areas.
 Lachlan
 F
 um
 is
 curious


about
 the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of
 your


scientific
 work
 um
 being
 either
 a


completely
 open
 source
 like
 Openfold
 or


proprietary
 like
 Alphafold
 um
 and
 can


both
 of
 these
 options
 accelerate


progress
 and
 and
 possibly
 maybe
 limit


public
 benefits
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 I'm
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 in
 making


everything
 open
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 you


know
 we
 find
 that
 people
 build
 on
 what


we
 create
 and
 uh
 also
 it's
 you
 know
 as


scientists
 really
 the
 one
 of
 the
 goals


is
 to
 really
 have
 broad
 impact
 and
 the


more
 you
 share
 uh
 the
 more
 impact
 there


is
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 held
 for
 the


um
 uh
 the
 the
 people
 leaving
 my
 group
 to


uh
 who
 are
 starting
 their
 own
 group.


We've
 stayed
 there
 now
 over
 a
 hundred


former
 graduate
 students
 and
 postocs


who've
 left
 my
 group
 to
 start
 their
 own


labs
 in
 the
 US
 and
 around
 the
 world
 and


we've
 um
 I've
 encouraged
 them
 to
 keep


working
 in
 this
 area
 and
 so
 now
 we
 have


um
 this
 amazing
 community
 uh
 we
 have


yearly
 meetings
 where
 everyone's
 working


together
 and
 everyone
 everyone
 meets
 and


and
 shares
 what
 they've
 done
 and
 uh


things
 just
 have
 moved
 really
 really


quickly.
 So
 I
 think
 in
 general
 have


having
 everything
 open
 is
 um
 is
 is
 is


really
 a
 big
 advantage.
 Now
 if
 you're
 at


a
 company
 there's
 that
 has
 to
 be


moderated
 by
 the
 fact
 the
 company
 needs


ultimately
 to
 make
 money
 and
 so
 there


are
 different
 constraints
 but
 at
 a


public
 institution
 like
 the
 University


of
 Washington
 or
 really
 in
 any


university
 I
 think
 uh
 making
 everything


open
 is
 is
 the
 right
 way
 to
 go


>> and
 we've
 just
 we've
 seen
 that
 really


from
 the
 beginning
 uh
 we
 made
 well
 even


for
 our
 earlier
 generation
 nonAI


software
 called
 Rosetta
 we
 made
 it


widely
 available
 and
 that
 just
 created


this
 whole
 community
 around
 it
 which


really
 been
 wonderful.


I
 mean
 and
 that's
 and
 that
 speaks
 to


something
 that
 um
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 uh


from
 the
 community
 which
 is
 are
 just


questions
 around
 how
 to
 ensure
 um
 that


the
 proteins
 you're
 designing
 and
 just


as
 we
 think
 about
 just
 AI
 and


technological
 acceleration
 in
 general


that
 it
 remains
 in
 the
 best
 interests
 of


humanity
 um
 global
 peace
 kindness
 how
 do


we
 safeguard
 against
 um
 misuse
 uh
 in
 a


world
 where
 some
 people
 are
 you
 know


there
 are
 some
 bad
 actors
 and
 looking
 to


use
 things
 for


>> yeah
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 very
 good


question
 and
 we
 are
 um
 let
 me
 first
 give


you
 an
 overall
 framing
 for
 it
 and
 then


I'll
 tell
 you
 about
 specific
 actions


we're
 taking.


The
 things
 that
 are
 are
 really
 dangerous


that
 the
 types
 of
 pathogens
 are
 like


viruses
 like
 the
 1918
 Spanish
 flu
 or


Ebola
 um
 which
 obviously
 can
 cause
 death


and
 destruction
 on
 a
 huge
 huge
 scale.


Those
 are
 extremely
 complex
 um
 uh
 um


things
 um
 and
 because
 they
 have
 to
 do


many
 many many
 different
 things
 and
 even


um
 even
 with
 the
 advances
 in
 protein


design,
 it's
 still
 very
 challenging
 to


uh
 to
 make
 a
 protein
 that
 that
 has
 one


function
 whereas
 a
 virus
 has
 to
 do
 many


many
 things.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 want
 to
 cause


death
 and
 destruction
 on
 a
 large
 scale,


you
 don't
 really
 the
 the
 design
 methods


don't
 help
 you.
 you
 just
 go
 to
 nature


and
 you
 can
 you
 can
 you
 know
 make
 remake


the
 1918
 Spanish
 flu.
 Um
 and
 so
 what


what
 the
 protein
 design
 methods
 are


really
 good
 at
 today
 is
 blocking
 um
 uh


blocking
 u
 for
 example
 viruses
 um
 either


uh
 you
 know
 pandemic
 viruses
 or
 or
 new


viruses
 um
 uh
 the
 idea
 of
 making
 a


synthetic
 virus
 is
 still
 well
 first
 of


all
 there's
 not
 really
 any
 reason
 to
 do


it
 because
 virus
 I
 told
 I
 said
 at
 the


beginning
 that
 um
 that
 design
 is
 very


powerful
 where
 there
 hasn't
 already
 been


extensive
 evolutionary
 optimization.
 So


for
 viruses
 there's
 been
 extensive


optimization
 for
 really
 rapid
 spreading


and
 uh
 infection.
 So
 um
 the
 the
 first


point
 is
 that
 the
 if
 you
 want
 to
 bad
 for


bad
 actors
 there
 already
 are
 many
 many


bad
 things
 all
 around
 all
 all
 the
 way


around
 ranging
 from
 you
 know
 things
 like


botulinum
 toxin
 to
 major
 viruses
 and
 I


really
 think
 the
 primary
 role
 of
 protein


design
 will
 be
 to
 protect
 against
 these


threats
 and
 new
 threats.
 But
 of
 course


it
 is
 possible
 that
 um
 a
 bad
 actor


really
 has
 their
 mindset
 to
 try
 and


create
 something
 new
 and
 dangerous.
 So


we
 had
 a
 workshop
 at
 the
 University
 of


Washington
 um
 uh
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago


uh
 to
 that
 was
 um
 uh
 that
 we
 convened


together
 with
 the
 National
 Security


Council
 um
 in
 the
 White
 House
 and
 we
 uh


convened
 a
 panel
 of
 experts
 uh
 to
 really


think
 about
 this
 problem.
 And
 our


conclusion
 was
 first
 of
 all
 that
 the


current
 generation
 of
 design
 methods
 did


not
 pose
 a
 threat
 compared
 to
 the
 huge


threats
 that
 already
 are
 present
 in


nature.
 Um
 but
 second
 that
 the
 way
 to


control
 things
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 and
 is


was
 to
 um
 was
 through
 the
 the
 synthetic


gene
 manufacturing
 step
 where
 you
 go


from
 the
 computer
 to
 the
 real
 world
 and


as
 I
 said
 earlier
 that's
 a
 key
 step
 in


this
 process
 and
 that's
 the
 one
 where


having
 like
 um
 gating
 and
 control
 or
 at


least
 logging
 we
 we
 concluded
 will
 be


really
 really
 important
 um
 and
 so
 we
 are


urging
 DNA
 synthesis
 companies
 to
 keep


track
 of
 everything
 that's
 that
 they're


making
 so
 that
 in
 the
 event
 uh
 that


there
 is
 a
 suspicious
 outbreak
 somewhere


in
 the
 world,
 you
 can
 quickly
 track


where
 the
 DNA
 came
 from
 if
 it
 was


synthetic
 rather
 than
 um
 being
 of


natural
 origin.


>> Excuse
 me.
 That's
 great.
 It
 seems
 like


there
 is
 um
 some
 thought
 to
 how
 to


create
 this
 responsibly
 as
 we're
 enter


feels
 like
 a
 really
 a
 brave
 new
 world.


um
 and
 that
 there
 you
 believe
 that
 there


are
 more
 benefits
 um
 to
 pursuing
 this


than
 the
 risks
 that
 are
 presented


>> right
 and
 that's
 very
 clear
 so
 far
 I


mean
 the
 um
 I
 mean
 there's
 huge
 numbers


of
 beneficial
 things
 have
 been
 done
 I


mean
 even
 in
 the
 area
 of
 pathogenic


disease
 you
 know
 I
 described
 the


vaccines
 the
 antivirals
 and
 um
 uh
 so
 the


um
 yeah
 I
 think
 the
 upsides
 far
 outweigh


the
 downside
 the
 other
 thing
 we're
 doing


is
 we
 are
 setting
 up
 sort
 of
 a
 um
 a
 a


committee
 that's
 that's
 reviewing
 new


software
 as
 it's
 created
 to
 make
 sure


that
 um
 to
 to
 vet
 the
 rel
 to
 make
 sure


that
 there
 aren't
 um
 unforeseen


consequences.
 I
 would
 say
 overall
 the
 um


the
 risks
 if
 you
 think
 about
 AI
 and


biology
 compared
 to
 AI
 generally
 I
 think


the
 immediate
 risk
 from
 AI
 more


generally
 in
 the
 form
 of
 of
 computer


viruses
 you
 know
 things
 that
 you
 don't


have
 to
 instantiate
 in
 the
 real
 world


but
 that
 work
 in
 software
 um
 we're


already
 seeing
 uh
 problems
 there
 and


then
 of
 course
 we're
 seeing
 more
 broader


problems
 have
 you
 know
 with
 with


employment
 and
 AI
 replacing
 people
 I


think
 those
 are
 probably
 the
 places


where
 AI's
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 a
 pro


problem
 a
 negative
 um
 rather
 than
 AI
 in


in
 the
 biological
 realm.


>> Well,
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the
 the


future
 um
 and
 sort
 of
 where
 this
 is


headed
 uh
 we
 we
 have
 a
 question
 from


Nicholas
 uh
 D
 uh
 if
 if
 you
 see
 a
 future


where
 computational
 design
 of
 proteins


could
 potentially
 displace
 approaches


like
 evolution
 or
 will
 it
 never
 reach


those
 heights?
 No,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that


um
 already
 with
 problems
 like
 like


antibbody
 design,
 antibbody
 generation,


antibodies
 are
 really
 kind
 of
 the
 the


pharmaceutical
 industry
 um
 uh
 antibodies


have
 been
 a
 mainstay
 and
 generally
 the


way
 that
 antibodies
 are
 developed
 now.


It's
 either
 from
 um
 um
 sort
 of
 pulling


antibodies
 out
 of
 an
 individual
 or


immunizing
 an
 animal
 or
 screening


through
 very
 very
 large
 collection
 of
 r


very
 large
 random
 libraries
 for
 an


antibbody
 that
 has
 the
 right
 property.
 I


think
 those
 will
 be
 displaced
 by
 design


because
 you
 can
 be
 much
 more
 intentional


and
 design
 an
 antibbody
 that
 not
 only


binds
 to
 the
 right
 place
 on
 your
 target


to
 have
 the
 effect
 you
 want
 but
 also
 has


all
 the
 properties
 needed
 to
 really
 be


developed
 as
 a
 drug.
 So
 I
 think
 more
 and


more
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 random


selection,
 random
 sort
 of
 library


screening
 methods
 which
 are
 kind
 of


emulating
 evolution
 where
 you
 know


evolution
 is
 also
 all
 random
 mutation


generation
 and
 selection.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 that
 replaced
 by
 um
 uh
 by


intentional
 protein
 design.
 And
 that


harks
 back
 to
 what
 I
 said
 in
 my
 TED
 talk


where
 um
 uh
 where
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 made
 the


point
 that
 um
 you
 know
 human
 technology


outside
 of
 biology
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 you


start
 from
 first
 principles
 if
 you
 want


to
 build
 a
 bridge
 across
 a
 river
 or
 a


flying
 machine
 um
 you
 don't
 go
 looking


for
 a
 log
 that
 has
 the
 right
 shape
 um


but
 you
 actually
 construct
 it
 for
 first


from
 first
 principles
 and
 so
 I
 think
 now


that's
 becoming
 more
 and
 more
 a
 reality


throughout
 sort
 of
 bio
 about
 um


biotechnology


>> and
 when
 you
 you
 think
 about
 your
 your


work
 um
 in
 protein
 development
 you
 know


so
 we
 we're
 so
 much
 of
 what
 this


conversation
 has
 been
 focused
 on
 the


things
 you
 said
 in
 2019
 and
 um
 when
 you


gave
 your
 talk
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you


foresee
 you
 know
 in
 six
 years
 from
 now


um
 when
 we
 speak
 again
 uh
 where
 do
 you


think
 things
 will
 be
 what
 do
 you
 believe


be
 focused
 on


>> I
 think
 predicting
 the
 future
 of
 science


is
 far
 harder
 than
 predicting
 the


structure
 of
 a
 protein
 or
 predicting
 the


weather
 tomorrow
 so
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 I


predicting
 how
 fast
 uh
 science
 will


progress
 is
 a
 famously
 impossible


challenge.
 Um
 but
 I
 can
 say
 broadly


speaking
 six
 years
 from
 now
 I
 expect
 to


see
 um
 uh
 medicines
 of
 many
 more


medicines
 approved
 for
 use
 in
 humans.
 I


expect
 to
 see
 you
 know
 solutions
 to


major
 problems
 in
 really
 across
 the


areas
 that
 um
 uh
 that
 I've
 described.


And
 then
 I
 also
 anticipate
 that
 we'll
 be


working
 in
 the
 field
 will
 be
 working
 on


problems
 that
 I
 haven't
 even
 mentioned
 I


haven't
 mentioned
 today
 because
 I


haven't
 thought
 of
 them.
 So,
 uh,
 things


are
 changing
 so
 fast
 that,
 um,
 I
 really,


what
 I
 really
 hope
 most
 is,
 you
 know,


we're
 solving
 problems
 I
 can't
 even


conceive
 of
 now.


>> That's
 wonderful.
 Um,
 well,
 David,
 I


feel
 like
 this
 has
 been
 a
 wonderful
 um,


conversation
 and
 uh,
 just
 really


grateful
 to
 you
 for
 for
 joining
 us.
 We


we
 have
 had
 so
 many
 member
 questions,
 so


thank
 you
 to
 the
 members
 as
 well.
 Um,


thank
 you
 so
 much,
 David,
 for
 sharing


all
 of
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 thanks
 thanks
 to
 everyone


who's
 listening
 and
 contributing


questions.
 It's
 been
 great.
 Thanks
 to


Ted
 for
 organizing
 this.
 And
 I
 just
 want


to
 thank
 again
 all
 the
 amazing
 students


and
 posttos
 and
 others
 I'm
 working
 with


now
 and
 in
 the
 past
 who
 really
 made
 all


this
 work
 possible
 and
 who
 have
 actually


done
 all
 the
 work
 really.
