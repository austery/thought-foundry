How
 do
 you
 think
 the
 Fed
 is
 looking
 at


tariffs,
 the
 uncertainty
 of
 tariffs?


Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 sectors
 and
 how


they
 perform.


A
 lot
 of
 investors
 getting
 whipsawed


every
 day
 by
 news
 events


breaking
 market
 headlines


and
 corporate
 news
 from
 across
 the


globe.


Could
 we
 see
 a
 market
 disruption,
 a


market
 event?
 Are
 people
 just
 too


exuberant
 out
 there?


You
 see
 some
 so-called
 lowquality
 stocks


driving
 this
 short-term
 rally?
 Bloomberg


Intelligence


with
 Scarlet
 Fu
 and
 Paul
 Sweeney


on
 Bloomberg
 Radio,
 YouTube,
 and


Bloomberg
 Originals.


On
 today's
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 Show,


we
 dig
 inside
 the
 big
 business
 stories


impacting
 Wall
 Street
 and
 global


markets.


Each
 and
 every
 week,
 we
 provide
 in-depth


research
 and
 data
 on
 some
 of
 the
 2,000


companies
 and
 130
 industries
 our


analysts
 cover
 worldwide.
 Today,
 we'll


look
 at
 how
 AMD
 landed
 a
 deal
 with
 Open


AI
 to
 build
 AI
 infrastructure.


Plus,
 why
 Dell
 Technologies
 is
 roughly


doubling
 its
 growth
 estimates
 for
 sales


and
 profit
 for
 the
 next
 two
 years.


But
 first,
 we
 begin
 with
 a
 big
 deal
 in


the
 banking
 sector.


This
 week,
 Fifth
 Third
 agreed
 to
 buy


Comica
 for
 about
 $10.9
 billion
 in
 stock.


It
 is
 the
 largest
 US
 bank
 deal
 this


year.


The
 deal
 will
 create
 the
 ninth
 largest


bank
 in
 the
 country
 with
 about
 $288


billion
 in
 assets
 according
 to
 the
 two


companies.
 So,
 we
 called
 in
 Herman
 Chan,


Bloomberg
 Intelligence,
 senior
 analyst


for
 US
 regional
 banks,
 and
 we
 began
 by


asking
 Herman
 for
 his
 take
 on
 the
 deal.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 win-win
 for
 both.


Uh,
 Kamea
 has
 been
 sort
 of
 in
 the


doldrums
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years


after
 the
 SBB
 debacle.
 Um,
 it's
 taken


some
 long
 time
 to
 get
 it
 under
 its
 own


footing.
 Um,
 and
 they've
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 agitated
 investors
 and
 activists


pushing
 for
 a
 sale
 and
 this
 was
 a
 great


outcome.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 for
 Fifth


Third,
 it's
 it's
 a
 great
 deal.
 It
 moves


them
 into
 growth
 growthier
 markets
 in


Texas
 and
 California.
 Yeah.
 Supplements


their
 Michigan
 presence
 and
 and
 really


uh
 builds
 out
 their
 their
 branching


presence
 across
 the
 the
 southeast
 and


southwest.


So,
 within
 the
 regional
 banking
 space,


what
 does
 this
 deal
 put
 pressure
 on?
 Who


does
 this
 deal
 put
 pressure
 on
 to
 make
 a


move
 of
 their
 own?


Yeah.
 So,
 that
 that's
 a
 qu
 question,
 the


follow-on
 question,
 like
 who's
 next?
 So


there
 are
 other
 uh
 banks
 that
 are


operating
 within
 the
 size
 of
 of
 a
 fifth


that
 have
 also
 done
 deals
 like
 a
 PNC
 and


a
 Huntington
 and
 the
 others
 that
 are


still
 on
 the
 sidelines
 are
 are
 banks


like
 regions
 in
 the
 southeast.
 Uh
 uh
 uh


key
 cororp
 in
 Ohio
 as
 well
 and
 Mnt
 and


Citizens
 in
 the
 Northeast.
 So
 those
 are


the
 ones
 that
 probably
 are
 going
 to
 get


asked
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 on
 the
 32


earnings
 call
 about
 M&A.
 So
 what
 do
 we


know
 about
 the
 Trump
 administration
 and


its
 view
 towards
 bank
 consolidation?
 Are


they
 opined
 on
 this
 at
 all?


Yeah.
 So
 we
 can
 see
 that
 these
 bank


deals
 are
 getting
 approved
 at
 a
 much


faster
 clip.
 So
 I
 mentioned
 Huntington


earlier.
 They're
 they're
 buying
 a
 bank


in
 Texas
 named
 Veritex.
 That's
 right.


And
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 them
 about
 98


days
 from
 deal
 close
 for
 merger


announcements.
 And
 that
 contrasts
 with


under
 the
 Biden
 administration,
 it's


taken
 400
 to
 600
 days
 for
 a
 large
 bank


deal.
 So
 these
 deals
 under
 Trump
 are


being
 fast-tracked
 and
 it's
 really


encouraging
 the
 management
 teams
 to
 to


really
 go
 out
 there
 and
 search
 for


deals.


So
 for
 so
 long
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 had


commented
 that
 the
 US
 is
 overbanked.
 Uh


by
 one
 count
 there's
 almost
 4,500
 FDIC


insured
 banking
 institutions
 here.
 Are


we
 still
 overbanked
 Herman?


I
 would
 say
 so.
 Um
 there
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 competition.
 Um
 these
 and
 that's
 the


reason
 why
 Coma
 is
 looking
 to
 sell
 uh


because
 they
 they
 were
 lacking
 in
 a


retail
 branch
 presence.
 Um
 they
 they


mostly
 bank
 uh
 middle
 market
 uh


commercial
 customers
 that
 are
 great
 but


it
 doesn't
 create
 the
 diversity
 that


they
 needed
 during
 times
 of
 stress
 like


the
 SVB
 environment.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 a


lesson
 learned
 um
 for
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 the


banking
 industry
 that
 you
 need
 to


diversify
 your
 deposit
 base
 and
 and
 one


way
 to
 diversify
 is
 to
 sell
 to
 a
 larger


organization.


Which
 segment
 of
 the
 banking
 industry
 is


uh
 bloated
 needs
 to
 streamline
 the
 most?


Yeah.
 So
 there
 you
 mentioned
 4500
 banks


like
 is
 does
 there
 need
 to
 be
 that
 many


banks
 within
 the
 United
 States?
 Probably


not.
 They
 don't
 have
 the
 scale
 to


operate
 a
 retail
 branch
 presence.
 they


don't
 have
 the
 the
 capabilities
 on
 the


fee
 side
 and
 the
 advisory
 side
 to
 really


help
 their
 customers
 on
 the
 commercial


side
 and
 you
 see
 so
 much
 competition


from
 not
 only
 larger
 banks
 uh
 but
 also


the
 fintexs
 that
 are
 just
 uh
 you
 know


biting
 at
 the
 heels
 on
 the
 consumer
 side


so
 it's
 a
 really
 tough
 operating


environment
 and
 and
 we
 expect
 more


consolidation
 over
 the
 next
 several


years


all
 right
 riddle
 me
 this
 year
 why
 do


banks
 even
 have
 branches
 I
 hear
 banks


talking
 about
 adding
 branches
 I
 haven't


been
 into
 a
 branch
 in
 years


across
 the
 street
 from
 Bloomberg


headquarters,
 City
 Group
 just
 city


branch
 right
 across


a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 marketing
 um
 because
 uh


and
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 scale.
 So
 for
 a
 bank


like
 Fifth
 Third,
 they're
 growing


organically
 in
 the
 southeast
 and
 that's


been
 a
 major
 growth
 driver
 for
 them.
 If


I
 need
 a
 branch
 to


you
 you
 don't
 need
 a
 branch
 but
 you
 need


the
 branch
 for
 a
 marketing
 aspect.
 So


you
 need
 a
 big
 billboard,
 right?
 It's
 a


big
 billboard
 and


big
 expensive
 billboard.


in
 markets
 where
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 foot


traffic
 and
 higher
 growth
 markets.
 So


it's
 a
 big
 billboard
 and
 it's
 been
 a


proven
 growth
 driver
 for
 banks.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 branches
 are
 declining.


So
 if
 you
 have
 critical
 mass
 and
 scale


in
 your
 existing
 markets,
 you
 can
 trim


your
 branch
 presence
 and
 not
 affect
 your


your
 depositors.
 But
 if
 you're
 entering


new
 markets,
 then
 then
 opening
 new


branches
 is
 the
 way
 to
 go.


I
 didn't
 think
 I
 could
 find
 my


checkbook.


Well,
 that
 raises
 a
 question.
 Does
 a


fintech
 that
 wants
 to
 be
 a
 bank
 need
 to


therefore
 have
 a
 retail
 presence?
 Do


they
 need
 to
 open
 up
 a
 branch
 also


across
 the
 street
 from
 our
 office?


So
 that's
 that's
 the
 beauty
 of
 the


fintech
 motto
 is
 that
 they're
 issuing


the
 the
 the
 branches.
 It's
 not
 a


requirement.
 It's
 a
 lower
 cost
 to
 serve


because
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 physical


retail
 presence.
 And
 uh
 it
 it's
 one
 way


to
 to
 really
 compete
 effectively
 with


these
 with
 these
 legacy
 banks
 where
 you


have
 a
 really
 easy
 to
 use
 app
 and
 you


you
 aren't
 burdened
 by
 this
 cost
 basis


of
 owning
 the
 physical
 presence.


All right.
 So
 when
 we
 had
 a
 couple


little
 blowups
 in
 your
 world
 a
 couple


years
 ago,
 I
 did
 I
 found
 this
 KRE,
 the


Spyder
 S&P
 regional
 banking
 ETF.


That's
 right.


Um
 how
 are
 you
 how
 are
 the
 regional


banks
 trading
 these
 days?
 Yeah.
 So,


they're
 really
 doing
 all
 right.
 Uh,


we're
 talking
 about
 price
 to
 tangibles


around,
 you
 know,
 1.5
 to
 1
 point


timesish.
 During
 the
 height
 of
 the


weakest
 point
 during
 the
 SBB
 debacle,
 it


was,
 you
 know,
 less
 than
 one
 time.
 So,


they've
 rebounded
 really
 nicely
 um


despite
 some
 of
 the
 uncertainty
 on
 the


economy
 and
 with
 tariffs
 and
 and
 so


we've
 seen
 some
 growth
 from
 them,


especially
 on
 the
 commercial
 lending


side.
 That
 that's
 really
 helped
 um
 grow


their
 top
 line.
 Our
 thanks
 to
 Herman


Chan.
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 senior


analyst
 for
 US
 regional
 banks.


We
 move
 next
 to
 some
 news
 in
 the
 telecom


space.


This
 week,
 Verizon
 Communications
 named


Dan
 Schulman
 as
 chief
 executive
 officer,


replacing
 Hans
 Vber.
 The
 goal
 was
 to


boost
 mobile
 subscriber
 growth
 and


shares.


Schulman
 is
 the
 previous
 CEO
 of
 PayPal


and
 brings
 financial
 and
 operational


leadership
 experience
 as
 well
 as


expertise
 in
 telecoms,
 technology,
 and


finance.
 Vesber
 will
 stay
 on
 for
 a
 year


to
 help
 ensure
 a
 smooth
 transition.
 For


more,
 I
 was
 joined
 by
 John
 Butler,


Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 senior
 telecom


analyst.
 I
 first
 asked
 John
 if
 this


change
 was
 expected
 at
 Verizon.


Not
 at
 all,
 Paul.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 think
 merger
 Monday,
 I've
 had
 a
 lot


of
 of
 busy
 Mondays
 lately,
 but
 the
 last


piece
 of
 news
 I
 expected
 was
 this
 change


in
 leadership
 at
 Verizon.
 Uh,
 the


company
 had
 really
 been
 sort
 of
 um
 I


guess
 prepping
 the
 head
 of
 the
 consumer


business
 or
 grooming
 is
 a
 better
 word.


uh
 summer
 Ryan
 Sam
 path
 who
 is
 just
 a
 a


phenomenal
 talent
 in
 my
 opinion
 and
 he's


been
 sort
 of
 pushed
 out
 there
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 investor
 conferences
 and
 giving


the
 investment
 community
 the
 impression


that
 he
 was
 the
 next
 in
 line.
 So
 when


the
 news
 broke
 that
 Dan
 is
 taking
 over


as
 CEO,
 it
 really
 surprised
 a
 lot
 of


people
 including
 me.
 So
 what's
 the


company
 saying
 here?
 Why
 do
 you
 think


they
 they
 chose
 this
 outsider
 versus


somebody
 that
 again
 uh
 an
 insider
 that


maybe
 the
 street
 thought
 was
 going
 to
 be


the
 next
 in
 line?


You
 know,
 I
 think
 for
 telecoms,
 all


three
 of
 the
 majors,
 the
 wireless


business
 is
 slowing
 very
 rapidly
 on


them.
 Uh
 we're
 seeing
 subscriber
 growth


down
 a
 lot
 this
 year.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


pressure
 on
 pricing.
 And
 I
 think
 the


thought
 is
 Dan
 Schulman
 used
 to
 be
 CEO


of
 PayPal.
 He's
 got
 experience
 at
 AMX
 in


the
 consumer
 finance
 business.
 So,


they're
 thinking
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 to


monetize
 the
 150
 million
 consumer


relationships
 they
 have
 to
 move
 into


adjacencies.
 The
 naming
 of
 Schulman
 in


my
 mind
 tells
 me
 they're
 looking
 to
 tap


the
 consumer
 finance
 market.
 You
 know,


they've
 already
 got
 a
 credit
 card


business.
 Um,
 I
 think
 it's
 probably


doing
 pretty
 well,
 but
 they're
 not


actually
 in
 the
 loan
 business
 there,
 but


they're
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 device
 financing.


And
 so,
 I
 think
 the
 hope
 may
 be,
 this
 is


my
 speculation,


maybe
 that
 they
 can
 take
 that
 perhaps
 a


step
 deeper
 into
 the
 consumer
 finance


market
 and
 maybe
 other
 adjacencies
 to
 be


able
 to
 monetize
 that
 base
 a
 little
 bit


more
 and
 diversify
 away
 from
 the


slowdown
 in
 wireless.


Yeah.
 know
 Verizon
 uh
 they've
 kind
 of


dabbled
 over
 the
 years
 in
 other


businesses
 uh
 purchasing
 AOL
 and
 Yahoo.


Um
 so
 what's
 the
 focus
 going
 forward


here?
 Is
 it
 to
 try
 to
 just


manage
 the
 wireless
 business
 as
 you
 know


the
 decline
 in
 the
 wireless
 business
 as


best
 they
 can?


So
 again
 it's
 the
 strategy
 here
 Paul
 I


think
 is
 to
 sort
 of
 build
 off
 that
 base


that
 they
 have.
 The
 wireless
 business
 is


stable.
 It's
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 It's
 a


typically
 a
 GDP
 plus
 business.
 Again,


we're
 seeing
 a
 slowdown
 now,
 so
 it
 could


move
 down
 to
 a
 GDP
 like
 growth
 rate,
 but


again,
 it's
 all
 about
 extensions.
 So,


all
 three
 of
 the
 majors
 here
 are
 pushing


hard
 into
 consumer
 broadband.
 They're


doing
 very
 well
 there,
 both
 in
 the
 fiber


and
 the
 fixed
 wireless
 access
 business,


but
 even
 that
 business
 is
 starting
 to


mature
 a
 bit
 as
 it
 saturates
 here
 in
 the


US.
 So
 the
 question
 becomes
 what's
 next?


And
 maybe
 the
 what's
 next
 could
 be


consumer
 finance.
 If
 you
 look
 at


T-Mobile,
 they've
 tapped
 the
 outdoor


advertising
 market
 which
 actually
 is


growing
 double
 digit.
 I
 I
 never
 would


have
 guessed,
 but
 there
 the
 thought
 is,


hey,
 as
 people
 carry
 around
 these


phones,
 we
 know
 where
 they
 are.
 perhaps


we
 can
 leverage
 that
 and
 come
 up
 with


very
 innovative
 ways
 of
 increasing
 uh


eyeballs
 on
 our
 outdoor
 advertising.
 So


I
 think
 they're
 looking
 for
 that
 type
 of


creative
 thinking
 to
 come
 up
 with
 new


ways
 of
 generating
 growth
 and
 again


you're
 trying
 to
 leverage
 that
 huge
 core


base
 of
 wireless
 subs
 that
 you
 have.


Just
 looking
 at
 their
 balance
 sheet,


John,
 uh
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 company


Verizon.
 It's
 got
 $170
 billion
 of
 total


debt
 there.
 How's
 the
 How
 does
 the


market
 feel
 about
 their
 balance
 sheet?


So,
 I
 think
 of
 the
 big
 three,
 Verizon
 is


probably
 at
 a
 point
 where
 they
 want
 to


be
 in
 terms
 of
 financing
 the
 business.


Can
 they
 load
 on
 a
 bunch
 more
 debt?
 It's


it's
 hard
 to
 say.
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 defer


to
 our
 credit
 analyst
 for
 that,
 Steve


Flynn.
 But
 um
 I
 don't
 view
 their
 ability


to
 finance
 new
 ventures
 as
 an
 issue
 here


at
 all.
 It's
 a
 very


cashrich
 business,
 wireless
 that
 is.
 And


um
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 will
 allow


Verizon
 to
 bankroll
 any
 of
 the
 new


ventures
 they
 plan
 to
 push
 into
 from


here.


Certainly
 pro
 shareholders
 is
 6.6%


dividend
 yield.
 Is
 that
 safe?


I
 think
 it
 is
 safe.
 That's
 a
 good


question.
 I
 think
 Verizon
 of
 the
 big


three
 really
 sort
 of
 gets
 it
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 dividend


to
 the
 investment
 community.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 telecoms
 out
 there,
 AT&T


included,
 that
 have
 cut
 the
 dividend
 in


the
 past
 and
 learned
 the
 hard
 way
 that


that
 really
 I
 call
 it
 the
 third
 rail
 of


telecom.
 I
 mean,
 you
 do
 not
 want
 to
 cut


the
 dividend.


Yeah.


So,
 my
 call
 here
 is
 that
 I
 think
 the


dividend
 is
 safe.
 Yes.
 Our
 thanks
 to


John
 Butler,
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence


senior
 telecom
 analyst.
 Coming
 up,
 a


look
 at
 how
 IBM
 is
 planning
 to
 integrate


AI
 tech.


You're
 listening
 to
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 on
 Bloomberg
 Radio,


providing
 in-depth
 research
 and
 data
 on


2,000
 companies
 and
 130
 industries.


You
 can
 access
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence


via
 BIGO
 on
 the
 terminal.
 I'm
 Scarlett


Fu


and
 I'm
 Paul
 Sweeney.
 This
 is
 Bloomberg.


[Music]


This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 with


Scarlett
 Fu
 and
 Paul
 Sweeney
 on


Bloomberg
 Radio.


We
 move
 to
 some
 news
 in
 the
 tech
 space.


This
 week,
 Advanced
 Micro
 Devices
 landed


a
 deal
 with
 OpenAI
 to
 build
 AI


infrastructure,
 and
 this
 gives
 the


chipmaker
 AMD
 a
 chance
 to
 challenge


Nvidia
 in
 the
 AI
 computing
 industry.


Open
 AAI
 will
 deploy
 AMD
 graphics


processing
 units
 over
 multiple
 years.


The
 deal
 also
 sets
 the
 stage
 for
 Open
 AI


to
 acquire
 a
 large
 stake
 in
 the


chipmaker
 with
 the
 ability
 to
 buy
 as


many
 as
 160
 million
 shares
 of
 AMD.


So,
 we
 asked
 for
 context
 from
 Ed
 Ledllo,


Btech
 co-anchor.
 We
 first
 asked
 Ed
 what


he
 makes
 of
 this
 week's
 deal.


The
 specifics
 of
 the
 deal
 are
 really


important.
 What
 is
 uh
 OpenAI
 going
 to


use
 AMD's
 technology
 for?
 It's
 going
 to


use
 it
 for
 inference.
 In
 other
 words,


running
 the
 models
 that
 already
 exist,


not
 training
 them.
 It
 is
 6
 GW
 of
 uh


capacity.
 Uh
 the
 reason
 that
 that
 figure


is
 critical
 is
 that
 it
 equates
 to
 the


peak
 electricity
 demand
 of
 most
 major
 US


cities
 like
 these
 are
 huge
 numbers
 as


you
 say
 but
 it
 just
 speaks
 to
 what's


happening
 to
 the
 mind
 of
 the


participants
 in
 the
 industry
 which
 is


they
 will
 need
 this
 capacity.
 Um
 you


guys
 are
 using
 words
 like
 top
 and
 bubble


and
 I
 think
 that's
 completely
 fair.


Maybe
 you
 saw
 my
 column
 on
 the
 debt
 uh


role
 that
 uh
 in
 what's
 happening
 but
 I


would
 say
 that
 AMD
 has
 done
 something


interesting
 here
 which
 is
 different
 to


what
 Nvidia
 did
 which
 is
 they
 will
 uh


issue
 stock
 to
 open
 AAI.
 AMD
 shares


going
 to
 open
 AAI
 but
 only
 once
 openai


has
 spent
 some
 money
 and
 actually
 built


some
 stuff.
 So
 where's
 open
 AI
 going
 to


get
 the
 money?
 Well,
 that's
 why
 Sam


Alman
 has
 been
 traveling
 the
 world


meeting
 with
 all
 kinds
 of
 investors,
 uh,


trying
 to
 get
 some
 funding.
 You
 said
 the


specifics
 matter,
 Ed,
 but
 we
 don't
 know


how
 much
 this
 partnership
 or
 this
 deal


is
 worth
 beyond
 the
 very
 generic
 tens
 of


billions
 of
 dollars,
 right?
 That
 could


be
 $10
 billion,
 that
 could
 be
 $99


billion.


Yes,
 that's
 correct.
 I
 mean,
 AMD
 CFO


framed
 it
 as
 being
 tens
 of
 billion


dollars
 of
 revenue
 opportunity.
 But


that's
 why
 I
 I
 think
 the
 specifics
 of


the
 terms
 I've
 made
 a
 careful


examination
 of
 them
 are
 really
 important


to
 understand
 versus
 what
 Nvidia
 did


with
 OpenAI.
 So
 Nvidia
 said
 it
 was
 going


to
 invest
 $100
 billion
 into
 Open
 AI.
 We


don't
 even
 know
 if
 that
 was
 cash
 or


chips
 in
 lie
 of
 cash
 but
 basically


Nvidia
 would
 get
 some
 equity
 in
 Open
 AI


in
 return.
 In
 this
 instance,
 AMD
 and


Open
 AI,
 Open
 AI
 is
 getting
 AMD
 shares,


but
 they
 are
 deliverable
 in
 tanches


against
 milestones
 which
 relate
 to


literally
 building
 the
 data
 centers.
 So


for
 each
 gigawatt
 of
 capacity
 that
 comes


online,
 AMD
 would
 then
 say
 here
 is
 this


tunch
 of
 stock.
 And
 that's
 why
 I'm


saying
 focus
 on
 the
 open
 AI
 obligation


here.
 They
 need
 actual
 money
 to
 dig
 up


the
 dirt,
 put
 the
 foundations
 in,
 get


the
 data
 center
 up,
 and
 put
 the
 servers


in
 before
 any
 of
 this
 stock
 uh
 comes


into
 play.


Our
 thanks
 to
 Ed
 Lelo,
 BT
 Tech


co-anchor.


Staying
 with
 tech,
 this
 week,
 the
 tech


company
 IBM
 announced
 a
 plan
 to


integrate
 anthropics
 AI
 technologies


into
 its
 software
 solutions.


IBM
 said
 it
 will
 make
 the
 startup's
 claw


family
 of
 large
 language
 models


accessible
 for
 its
 clients.
 Shares
 of


IBM
 jumped
 after
 the
 news.
 So
 for
 more


we're
 joined
 by
 honoragana
 Bloomberg


intelligence
 technology
 analyst.
 We


began
 by
 asking
 honor
 how
 he
 evaluates


this
 latest
 partnership.


See
 when
 you
 come
 to
 a
 company
 like
 IBM


I
 think
 they
 have
 done
 a
 very
 good
 job


of
 being
 open
 and
 partnering
 with
 other


vendors.
 I
 think
 they
 the
 acquisition
 of


Red
 Hat
 was
 the
 first
 such
 example
 a
 few


years
 ago
 and
 frankly
 speaking
 the


company
 has
 turned
 around
 quite
 a
 bit.


Now
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 software
 company
 than


it
 is
 a
 service
 or
 a
 hardware
 company.


IBM
 still
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 footprint
 in


legacy
 companies
 and
 their
 internal


infrastructure
 whether
 that's
 a


regulated
 entity
 whether
 that's
 you
 know


an
 on-remise
 software
 what
 they're


basically
 saying
 is
 for
 these
 companies


who
 want
 to
 add
 more
 AI
 capabilities


into
 their
 infrastructure
 we're
 going
 to


use
 one
 of
 the
 best
 models
 that's
 out


there
 and
 that's
 anthropic
 um
 they're


not
 you
 know
 just
 solely
 dependent
 on


IBM's
 own
 internal
 models
 but
 you
 know


we
 see
 more
 and
 more
 of
 that
 happening


that
 companies
 like
 IBM
 and
 other


services
 companies
 will
 go
 out
 and


partner
 with
 you
 know
 anthropic
 with


open
 AAI
 with
 Gemini
 and
 give
 more


enterprise
 capabilities
 to
 to
 to
 vendors


or
 to
 companies
 basically


how
 does
 anthropic
 differ
 from
 a
 open
 AI


if
 at
 all


it's
 a
 very
 good
 question
 Paul
 and
 right


now
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 is
 anthropic
 is


pushing
 more
 and
 more
 stuff
 on
 the


corporate
 side
 or
 the
 enterprise
 side
 um


on
 open
 AI
 side
 you
 know
 their
 core


business
 is
 still
 chat
 GPT
 which
 is
 the


app
 and
 that's
 more
 of
 a
 consumer
 app


right
 now
 and
 the
 question
 is
 you
 know


which
 one
 of
 the
 models
 will
 somebody


use
 whether
 if
 you
 are
 let's
 say
 a
 JP


Morgan
 or
 a
 city
 corp
 you
 know
 would
 you


be
 going
 to
 be
 using
 one
 of
 their
 models


or
 an
 open
 source
 model
 um
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 be
 using
 all
 of
 the


models
 what
 anthropic
 relationship
 with


IBM
 does
 it
 actually
 helps
 them
 to


spread
 the
 word
 out
 across
 their
 entire


customer
 base
 so
 if
 you
 are
 trying
 to


get
 more
 coding
 done
 for
 example
 in
 an


IT
 department
 and
 you
 have
 all
 the


legacy
 products
 that
 there
 now
 you
 can


use
 you
 know
 an
 AI
 model
 from
 Anthropic


rather
 than
 using
 you
 know
 whatever


tools
 you
 had
 before.


Okay,
 so
 it
 makes
 sense
 why
 Anthropic
 is


a
 good
 fit
 for
 IBM
 or
 how
 it's
 going
 to


incorporate
 uh
 Anthropic
 into
 its


software.
 But
 what
 does
 IBM
 specifically


offer
 Anthropic?
 What
 access
 does
 IBM


have
 that
 Anthropic
 wants
 and
 needs?


Yeah,
 that's
 another
 excellent
 question.


In
 this
 case,
 you're
 looking
 at
 IBM's


entire
 customer
 base.
 IBM
 has
 a
 very


large
 services
 business
 called
 IBM


Consulting.
 These
 consultants
 will
 go


out
 and
 sell
 anthropic
 software
 into
 the


enterprises
 and
 say
 hey
 bank
 let
 me
 help


you
 to
 you
 know
 automate
 this
 particular


process
 and
 you
 can
 use
 it
 with
 this


software.
 It
 drives
 their
 consulting


business
 and
 it
 also
 helps
 out
 their


software
 business
 which
 is
 you
 know


fairly
 popular
 right
 now.


IBM
 hit
 an
 all-time
 high
 on
 a
 rug.
 This


stock
 has
 found
 a
 new
 life
 hasn't
 it?


Absolutely.
 And
 and
 this
 is
 something


that
 we've
 been
 saying
 it
 for
 almost
 5


years
 now.
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 acquisition


of
 Red
 Hat
 completely
 changed
 it.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at,
 you


know,
 some
 of the
 comments
 we've
 made
 on


TV
 about
 IBM
 prior
 to
 Red
 Hat,
 it
 was
 a


very
 closed
 company.
 It
 only
 wanted
 to


sell
 their
 own
 products
 to
 people
 and


was
 not
 very
 keen
 on
 embracing,
 you


know,
 what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 open
 source.


With
 the
 acquisition
 of
 Red
 Hat
 and
 the


company
 saying,
 you
 know what,
 Red
 Hat


can
 work
 with
 any
 cloud
 provider.
 I


think
 that
 was
 the
 biggest
 difference
 to


me
 was
 it
 allowed
 Red
 Hat
 to
 work
 with


companies
 but
 based
 on
 Amazon
 Web


Services
 or
 Microsoft.
 So
 they
 were
 not


just
 pushing
 their
 own
 cloud
 products


and
 I
 think
 that
 really
 made
 a


difference.
 Their
 software
 business
 has


been
 doing
 so
 well
 comparatively
 to
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world
 and
 I
 think
 that's


where
 you
 see
 the
 market
 validation
 that


this
 is
 the
 right
 strategy
 for
 them.


Our
 thanks
 to
 Honor
 Ragan,
 a
 Bloomberg


intelligence
 technology
 analyst.


We
 move
 to
 some
 more
 news
 in
 the
 IT


hardware
 space.
 This
 week
 at
 its


investor
 day,
 Dell
 Technologies
 roughly


doubled
 its
 growth
 estimates
 for
 sales


and
 profit
 for
 the
 next
 two
 years.


Dell
 also
 said
 demand
 for
 artificial


intelligence
 products
 will
 extend
 those


higher
 projections
 at
 least
 through


2030.


Separately,
 Cisco
 systems
 says
 it
 is


releasing
 a
 new
 chip
 networking
 system


to
 connect
 AI
 data
 centers
 across


hundreds
 of
 miles.


So
 for
 more
 on
 both
 of
 these
 companies,


we
 were
 joined
 by
 Wuenho,
 Bloomberg


intelligence
 senior
 technology
 analyst.


We
 began
 by
 asking
 Wuj
 to
 break
 down


what
 we
 heard
 from
 Dell.


This
 is
 a
 very
 seasoned
 management
 team.


they
 have a
 tendency
 to
 give
 out
 three


to
 four
 year
 uh
 guidance
 plans.
 Um
 I
 I


think
 the
 surprise
 here
 is
 what's


driving
 um
 that
 uh
 7
 to
 9%
 growth


outlook
 for
 uh
 from
 2026
 to
 2020
 uh
 for


2030
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 AI
 servers


right
 and
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 they


said
 at
 the
 analyst
 day
 that
 AI
 servers


are
 going
 to
 grow
 at
 a
 20
 to
 25%


compounded
 rate.
 Um
 I
 I
 think
 there
 was


some
 skepticism
 there
 uh
 heading
 into


the
 into
 the
 print
 in
 terms
 of
 is
 there


an
 AI
 bubble
 and
 by
 laying
 out
 a
 20
 to


25%
 AI
 server
 growth
 going
 through
 2030


off
 of
 already
 high
 numbers
 shows
 that


there
 is
 some
 durability
 to
 AI
 server


demand.


So
 when
 you
 get
 an
 analyst
 meeting


together
 it's
 a
 big
 day
 for
 a
 company


they
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 effort
 in


putting
 getting
 their
 senior
 management


together
 putting
 together
 presentations


presenting
 a
 vision
 here.
 what
 were
 some


of
 the
 two
 or
 three
 takeaways
 from
 you


from
 this
 this
 investor
 day?


Yeah.
 So,
 so
 the
 the
 one
 highlight
 here


is
 uh
 the
 AI
 server
 demand,
 the


durability
 of
 AI
 server
 demand.
 Uh
 but


more
 importantly,
 um
 and
 we
 talk
 about


this
 all
 the
 time,
 you
 know,
 Paul,
 it's


it's
 about
 earnings
 and
 cash
 flow,


right?
 And
 the
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 uh


we're
 talking
 about
 EPS
 growth
 about


15%.
 And
 how
 do
 we
 get
 to
 that
 15%?


we're
 talking
 about
 8%
 o
 of
 the
 uh
 sales


growth
 dropping
 down
 to
 the
 bottom
 line,


but
 given
 all
 that
 cash
 generation,


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


capital
 returns
 uh
 through
 buybacks.
 So,


you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lift
 on
 EPS
 there.


So,
 shareholders
 are
 going
 to
 be
 happy


uh
 from
 uh
 from
 an
 EPS
 standpoint.
 And


we're
 already
 seeing
 that
 from
 from
 a


valuation
 standpoint
 uh
 because
 it
 is


lifting
 from
 an
 8
 to
 10
 times
 PE
 to


about
 15
 times
 growth,
 which
 makes
 it


into
 a
 one
 times
 peg.
 Uj
 another
 story


that
 we're
 tracking
 here
 and
 that
 I've


been
 fascinated
 by
 is
 this
 idea
 of


legacy
 tech
 companies
 um
 finding
 their


feet
 in
 this
 AI
 wave
 uh
 whether
 it's


Oracle,
 whether
 it's
 Dell
 and
 now
 Cisco


as
 well.
 Cisco
 is
 releasing
 a
 new
 chip


and
 networking
 system
 uh
 to
 connect
 AI


data
 centers
 and
 this
 is
 a
 move
 that


pretty
 much
 puts
 it
 in
 more
 direct


competition
 with
 Broadcom.
 How
 big
 of
 an


opportunity
 is
 this
 for
 Cisco
 and
 should


Broadcom
 be
 worried?


Yeah.
 So,
 so
 we
 we
 published
 in
 React.


Uh,
 and
 essentially
 I
 don't
 think


Broadcom
 should
 be
 fully
 worried.


There's
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 I'll


say,
 right?
 Cisco
 is
 actually
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 chip
 networking
 chip


manufacturers
 uh,
 globally.
 Uh,
 but
 more


for
 their
 legacy
 enterprise
 IT
 chips,


right?
 They
 they
 produce
 their
 own
 chips


that
 that
 powers
 their
 own
 networking


gear.
 Uh,
 they're
 fairly
 newer
 to
 the


game
 in
 the
 uh,
 the
 networking
 uh,
 chip


side.
 uh
 from
 a
 revenue
 standpoint,
 it's


really
 not
 a
 big
 driver.
 Uh
 but
 it
 may


be
 able
 to
 push
 more
 boxes.
 A
 couple


things
 that
 I'll
 say,
 they
 did
 about
 $1


billion
 in
 uh
 AI
 backend
 revenue,
 but
 to


put
 that
 into
 context,
 um
 you
 know,


they're
 doing
 about
 55
 to
 56
 billion
 in


total
 sales.
 So,
 you
 know,
 from
 from
 an


overall
 percentage
 of
 AIO
 as
 an
 overall


percentage
 of
 sales,
 it's
 still
 about
 2


to
 3%
 of
 total
 sales.
 Are
 they
 going
 to


challenge
 Broadcom?
 I
 I I
 I
 doubt
 it,


but
 I
 do
 think
 there'll
 be
 a
 second


source
 uh
 to
 the
 cloud
 providers
 uh
 uh


versus
 Broadcom.


Wooge,
 in
 your
 coverage
 area,
 what's


your
 best
 AI
 play?
 Because
 I'm
 sure
 you


get
 that
 call
 from
 clients
 all
 the
 time.


You
 know,
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 have
 a
 handful.


Uh
 Dell
 was
 one.
 Um
 you
 know,
 HP
 is


another
 one
 to
 to
 take
 a
 look
 out
 for.


Uh
 they
 have
 an
 analyst
 day
 next
 week.


uh
 but
 uh
 from
 from
 a
 networking


standpoint,
 Arista
 has
 actually
 been
 one


of
 the
 high-f
 flyers
 uh
 from
 from
 the
 uh


from
 from
 a
 networking
 uh
 standpoint.
 So


uh
 I
 I
 I
 would
 look
 at
 Arista
 and
 uh


people
 have
 been
 uh
 taking
 the
 AI


networking
 angle
 uh
 and
 and
 using
 uh


Arista
 as
 one
 of
 the
 tools.


I
 like
 that.
 Orisa,
 I
 haven't
 heard
 that


one
 come
 up
 yet,
 you
 know.
 Um
 HPE
 or


HPQ,
 just
 to
 clarify.


Oh,
 HPE.
 So
 think
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 mini


Dell
 and
 a
 mini
 Cisco
 in
 one.
 Our
 thanks


to
 Wu
 Jinho,
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence


senior
 technology
 analyst.


Coming
 up,
 we'll
 look
 at
 why
 the
 owner


of
 the
 Corona
 and
 Modello
 special
 brands


reported
 positive
 quarterly
 results.


You're
 listening
 to
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 on
 Bloomberg
 Radio,


providing
 in-depth
 research
 and
 data
 on


2,000
 companies
 and
 130
 industries.


You
 can
 access
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence


through
 BIGO
 on
 the
 terminal.
 I'm


Scarlett
 Fu


and
 I'm
 Paul
 Sweeney.
 This
 is
 Bloomberg.


This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 with


Scarlett
 Fu
 and
 Paul
 Sweeney
 on


Bloomberg
 Radio.
 We


move
 next
 to
 some
 news
 in
 the
 consumer


product
 space.


This
 week,
 Constellation
 Brands,
 which


owns
 Corona
 and
 Modella
 Special
 Brands


in
 the
 US,
 reported
 better
 than
 expected


results
 for
 its
 fiscal
 second
 quarter.


The
 company
 cited
 robust
 beer
 and
 wine


sales.


This
 comes
 despite
 the
 company's
 stock


falling
 more
 than
 30%
 this
 year.
 Beer


and
 alcoholic
 beverages
 in
 general
 have


broadly
 struggled
 as
 younger
 consumers


and
 women
 drink
 less.
 So
 for
 more
 on


this
 and
 other
 news
 in
 the
 consumer


space,
 we
 were
 joined
 by
 Ken
 Shay,


Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 senior
 consumer


products
 analyst.


We
 first
 asked
 Ken
 more
 about
 why


Constellation
 Brands
 had
 been
 struggling


this
 year.


It's
 definitely
 um
 a
 slow
 beer
 market.


Um
 uh
 tariffs
 are
 playing
 a
 role
 uh
 and


also
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 um
 crackdown
 you


know
 that
 ICE
 has
 had
 in
 inner
 community


is
 hurting
 the
 Hispanic
 uh
 community
 and


their
 socialization
 trends.
 All
 these


things
 have
 been
 a
 factor
 for
 the
 last


couple
 quarters.
 The
 company
 said
 that


um
 their
 beer
 volumes
 were
 not
 quite
 as


poor
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 street
 analysts


expected.
 Uh
 but
 the
 pressures
 are
 still


on
 uh
 and
 and
 they're
 very
 real
 for
 this


company.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 because
 their


their
 suite
 of
 products
 as
 you
 mentioned


Corona
 Medel
 these
 command
 high
 price


points
 about
 twice
 the
 level
 of
 a


popular
 beer.
 So
 in
 times
 where


consumers
 are
 pulling
 back
 a
 little


cautious
 about
 expenditures
 got
 to


remember
 you
 know
 you've
 had
 high


inflationary
 pricing
 in
 this
 category


for
 the
 last
 few
 years
 um
 these
 brands


aren't
 doing
 so
 well
 right
 now
 and
 then


compounding
 that
 with
 some
 of
 the


factors
 that
 I
 mentioned
 and
 some


longerterm
 issues
 like
 cannabis


substitution
 things
 we
 talked
 about
 GLP1


user
 not
 drinking
 as
 much
 moderation


among
 Gen
 Z
 all
 these
 things
 are


weighing
 up
 a
 company
 right
 now.
 Yeah,
 I


I'm
 I'm
 super
 interested
 in
 what
 you


said
 about
 the
 last
 part,
 like
 the


structural
 changes
 in
 consumer
 taste,


especially
 from
 Gen
 Z,
 younger
 people


overall.
 Um,
 beer
 is
 just
 not
 where


people
 want
 to
 be
 spending
 their
 money


necessarily.


That
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 case.
 You
 know,


it's
 it's
 it's
 been
 around
 a
 long
 time.


It's
 a
 $15
 billion
 market
 that
 is


growing
 very
 slowly.
 It's
 essentially


flat.
 In
 fact,
 volumes
 are
 expected
 to


be
 down
 low
 single
 digit
 this
 year.
 So,


clearly,
 it's
 a
 very
 mature
 category.


And
 what
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 last
 few


years
 is
 consumers
 just
 want
 different


tastes.
 You
 know,
 you
 have
 a


proliferation
 of
 the
 rated
 drink


cocktails
 you
 you
 know
 like
 um
 Truli
 and


White
 Claws
 and
 more
 sophisticated
 you


know
 margaritas
 in
 a
 can
 and
 so
 on.


That's
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 consumer
 who


wants
 taste
 experimentation
 are
 going


and
 then
 you
 have
 other
 more
 mundane


factors
 like
 just
 uh
 you
 know
 calorie


more
 conscientious
 calorie
 counts
 and


all
 these
 things
 are
 just
 weighing
 on


this
 very
 very
 mature
 industry.
 So,


somebody
 like
 Constellation
 Brands,
 do


they
 go
 out
 and
 look
 to
 maybe
 buy
 some


of
 these
 brands
 or
 or
 verticals
 that


within
 the
 spirits
 business
 may
 be


growing?


Well,
 they've
 had
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 mixed
 uh


history
 of
 M&A
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years.


I
 I'll
 put
 it
 I'll
 be
 kind
 say
 that
 way.


Um
 not
 really.
 The
 you
 know,
 they're


downsizing
 their
 wine
 and
 spirit
 segment


um
 and
 try
 to
 shift
 it
 to
 more
 of
 a


high-end
 mix,
 which
 I
 think
 they're


having
 success
 with.
 But
 what
 that
 does


is
 it
 makes
 their
 beer
 business
 even


that
 much
 more
 important.
 It's
 now
 about


85%
 of
 their
 sales.
 So
 as
 beer
 goes,
 I


mean
 the
 company
 has
 really
 good
 brands


um
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 brand
 loyalty
 there,
 but


again
 it's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 wiggle
 room.
 So


So
 with
 beer
 becoming
 less
 popular
 and


you
 mentioned
 other
 big
 trends
 like
 um


Ompic
 weight
 loss
 drugs
 and
 greater
 uh


cannabis
 use,
 what
 is
 Constellation


doing
 about
 non-alcoholic
 beverages?


Oh,
 so
 they
 so
 they've
 rolled
 out
 a


non-alcoholic
 Corona
 brand.
 They've
 come


out
 uh
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 they
 came
 out


with
 a
 low
 calorie
 uh
 brand
 uh
 called


Medela
 Oro
 Corona
 no
 alcohol
 I
 think
 I


mentioned.
 Uh
 so
 those
 two
 brands
 while


they're
 relatively
 small
 they
 see
 uh
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 that's
 on


trend
 uh
 with
 what
 you
 said.
 So
 um
 you


know
 they're
 doing
 that.
 They're
 also


modifying
 some
 of
 their
 portfolio
 for


more
 taste.
 There's
 consumers
 that
 want


a
 lot
 of
 taste.
 They're
 coming
 out
 with,


you
 know,
 um
 a
 fruity
 uh
 survea
 and
 uh


so
 they're
 doing
 as
 much
 as
 they
 can
 to


stay
 on
 trend
 with
 consumers.


I
 love
 myself
 a
 grapefruit
 beer.
 Yeah.


There's
 a
 German
 grapefruit
 beer
 that
 I


really
 like.


Yeah.
 Tastes
 good.


Talk
 to
 us
 about
 this
 legal
 cannabis
 and


obesity
 drugs
 and
 the
 impact
 that's


having
 on
 kind
 of
 the
 beer
 business,
 the


spirits
 business
 overall.
 Ken,
 is
 that


something
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 companies


are
 calling
 out?
 BI
 came
 out
 with
 our


fourth
 annual
 consumer
 survey
 on


beverage
 preferences
 and
 again
 u
 we
 see


that
 consumers
 are
 substituting
 uh


cannabis
 for
 alcohol.
 Of
 the
 of


consumers
 that
 do
 partake
 in
 cannabis


now
 more
 than
 half
 have
 substituted
 for


alcohol
 at
 least
 once
 a
 week


and
 that's
 up
 from
 46%
 last
 year.
 So


that's
 a
 trend
 that
 just
 keeps
 moving.


Now,
 uh,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these


cannabis
 companies
 coming
 out
 with
 hemp


THC
 products,
 uh,
 beverages
 that
 are


sold
 in
 mainstream
 liquor
 stores.
 You


know,
 traditional
 cannabis,
 uh,
 legal


cannabis
 sold
 in
 dispensaries,
 it
 was


not
 really
 a
 big
 hit.
 But
 now
 that
 some


of
 these
 federally
 legal
 uh,
 hemp
 based


THC
 products,
 beverages
 are
 sold
 in


liquor
 stores
 right
 next
 to
 the
 beer


aisle
 in
 about
 half
 the
 states
 of
 the


country.
 That's
 really
 chipping
 away


also
 at
 at
 beer
 consumption.
 Uh,
 final


question
 to
 you,
 Ken.
 What
 about
 return


of
 cash
 to
 shareholders?
 I'm
 looking
 at


the
 dividend
 yield
 about
 2.9%
 if
 you're


being
 generous.
 Um,
 is
 Constellation


Brand
 still
 able
 to
 make
 good
 on
 its


dividends,
 continue
 buying
 back
 its


shares?


Yeah,
 that's
 an
 important
 point,


Scarlet.
 Um,
 yes,
 they
 can.
 Uh,
 despite


the
 the
 pressure
 on
 sales,
 believe
 it
 or


not,
 the
 operating
 margins
 a


Constellation
 generates
 are


best-in-class.
 They're
 about
 twice
 that


of
 other
 alcohol
 and
 beverage
 companies


in
 general.
 So
 they
 have
 strong
 cash


flows.
 As
 a
 matter
 of
 fact,
 they're


winding
 down
 um
 construction
 of
 a


brewery
 right
 now.
 Over
 the
 next
 couple


years,
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 free
 cash


flow
 likely
 rising.
 So
 it's
 high
 in


rising
 and
 that's
 enabling
 them
 to


continue
 to
 uh
 meet
 their
 commitments
 to


share
 buybacks
 and
 dividends.


Our
 thanks
 to
 Kenneth
 Shay,
 Bloomberg


Intelligence,
 a
 senior
 consumer
 products


analyst.


We
 move
 next
 to
 some
 news
 on


Intercontinental
 Exchange
 or
 ICE.
 This


week,
 we
 heard
 the
 company
 plans
 to


invest
 as
 much
 as
 $2
 billion
 in
 cash
 in


Poly
 Market,
 which
 is
 a
 crypto-based


betting
 platform.


The
 transaction
 values
 Poly
 Market
 at


roughly
 $8
 billion,
 and
 ICE
 will
 become


a
 global
 distributor
 of
 Poly
 Market's


eventdriven
 data.


We
 are
 joined
 by
 Katherine
 Doy,


Bloomberg
 Finance
 reporter.
 We
 first


asked
 Katherine
 for
 some
 more
 background


on
 ICE.
 It
 runs
 on
 the
 blockchain.
 So


you
 have
 this
 storied
 institution
 ICE


that
 owns
 the
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange
 as


you
 mentioned
 and
 they're
 putting
 their


money
 where
 their
 mouth
 is.
 It
 really
 is


an
 indication
 of
 where
 the
 the
 market
 is


headed.
 So
 you
 have
 these
 institutional


players
 that
 are
 teaming
 up
 with
 either


cryptonative
 firms
 or
 in
 this
 case
 it's


also
 the
 prediction
 market
 based
 players


and
 we
 have
 seen
 this
 recently
 with
 also


CME
 the
 derivatives
 exchange
 based
 in


Chicago.
 They're
 partnering
 with
 FanDuel


and
 most
 people
 associate
 FanDuel
 with


sports
 betting.
 Um,
 but
 they
 are
 big
 in


prediction
 markets
 as
 well.
 And
 with
 CME


and
 FanDuel,
 they're
 doing
 a
 uh
 a


marketsbased
 prediction
 of
 yes
 or
 no.


Will,
 for
 example,
 gold
 be
 above
 a


certain
 benchmark?
 Um
 and
 it
 this


announcement
 also
 shows
 a
 storied


institution
 kind
 of
 getting
 behind
 the


newer
 incumbents
 and
 showing
 where
 they


see
 the
 the
 next
 phase
 of
 the
 market


headed.


What
 does
 Poly
 Market
 really
 do?
 I
 see


them
 quoted
 around
 in
 the
 press
 and


things
 like
 that.


So
 you've
 probably
 seen
 Poly
 Market


around
 the
 time
 of
 the
 election.
 They


were
 one
 of
 the
 platforms
 that
 um
 users


were
 placing
 bets
 on
 who
 was
 going
 to


win
 the
 presidential
 election.
 um
 they


at
 a
 time
 were
 also
 in
 the
 news
 around


2022
 because
 they
 were
 prohibited
 from


actually
 operating
 in
 the
 US
 and
 more


recently
 in
 the
 last
 uh
 few
 months
 in


2025
 they've
 re-entered
 the
 US
 market


and
 they've
 done
 so
 um
 through
 two


avenues
 one
 it's
 a
 changing
 regulatory


environment
 it's
 a
 cryptofriendly


um
 regulatory
 regime
 and
 number
 two
 they


bought
 their
 own
 uh
 regulated


derivatives
 platform
 that
 essentially


allowed
 them
 it
 was
 a
 pathway
 back
 into


the
 United
 States
 market.


So
 with
 this
 deal
 which
 values
 Poly


Market
 at
 about
 $8
 billion
 um
 IC
 ICE


becomes
 a
 global
 distributor
 of
 Poly


Market's
 event
 driven
 data.
 What
 does


that
 mean
 to
 have
 that
 data
 now
 in
 its


hands?
 What
 can
 it
 do
 with
 that


information?
 Because
 exchanges
 don't


just
 they're
 not
 just
 a
 platform
 for


collecting
 commissions
 on
 trades.


They're
 also
 huge
 source
 of
 information


data
 that
 they
 then
 sell.


That's
 right.
 It's
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 their


business.
 And
 you
 have
 these
 big


institutions
 that
 are
 paying
 millions
 of


dollars
 um
 for
 access
 to
 this
 data.
 And


as
 the
 market
 becomes
 a
 mix
 of


institutional
 client
 base
 and
 retail


clients,
 that
 data,
 these
 companies,
 you


have
 ICE,
 you
 have
 Poly
 Market.
 This


combination
 is
 giving
 ICE
 access
 to


retail
 clients
 that
 they
 otherwise


wouldn't
 necessarily
 have
 access
 to.
 and


vice
 versa.
 Poly
 market
 gets
 now
 all
 of


their
 data
 displayed
 through
 ICE


channels
 uh
 that
 institutional
 clients


have
 been
 set
 up
 and
 working
 with
 ICE


for
 for
 years.
 So
 it's
 a
 fast
 entry
 way


for
 both
 companies
 to
 increase
 their


user
 base,
 increase
 their
 access
 and
 how


they
 market
 themselves
 to
 an
 entirely


new
 client.
 So
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 some


of
 these
 traditional
 ex
 exchanges,
 if


you
 will,
 I
 think
 that
 are
 they
 saying


basically,
 hey,
 if
 we
 want
 to
 grow
 in


the
 future,
 we
 have
 to
 embrace
 some
 of


these
 new
 asset
 classes,
 whether
 it's


crypto
 or
 whether
 it's
 predictive


markets
 and
 things
 like
 that
 kind
 of


what
 they're
 telling
 us.


I
 think
 that
 it's
 very
 much
 where
 they


see
 their
 clients
 headed.
 Um
 there's
 a


blurring
 line
 between
 you
 have
 hedge


funds
 and
 traditional
 institutional


firms
 and
 then
 you
 have
 retail
 investors


that
 at
 a
 time
 there
 was
 so
 much
 news


during
 the
 memeto
 era
 uh
 around
 who


these
 users
 were
 um
 that
 were
 in
 their


basement.
 But
 now
 these
 are
 really


sophisticated
 investors
 that
 are
 playing


in
 the
 options
 market
 um
 prediction


markets.
 Many
 of
 the
 leaders
 of
 these


exchanges
 are
 saying
 there
 is
 no


difference
 between
 what
 we've
 been


running
 and
 at
 least
 a
 binary
 yes
 or
 no.


Is
 this
 uh
 index
 going
 to
 be
 above
 or


below
 a
 certain
 threshold.
 Um
 they're


they're
 combining
 to
 what
 was
 presumably


two
 different
 worlds
 into
 one
 now.


And
 competitors
 of
 Poly
 Market
 include


Koshi
 and
 Crypto.com.


Are
 you
 anticipating,
 Katherine,
 that


there there's
 going
 to
 be
 similar


tie-ups
 for
 those
 companies
 as
 well?


There
 is
 a
 race
 to
 um
 I
 I
 believe
 that


this
 is
 just
 the
 start
 um
 or
 really
 the


CME
 partnership
 with
 FanDuel
 was
 kind
 of


the
 first
 indication.
 This
 is
 just


another
 and
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 going
 to


be
 off
 to
 the
 races
 in
 terms
 of
 who


partners
 up
 next
 because
 you
 to
 build


something
 from
 scratch
 is
 is
 hard
 and


when
 you
 partner
 with
 a
 existing
 client


base
 too
 it
 is
 an
 easy
 way
 in
 to
 an


entirely
 new
 market.


I
 tell
 it
 wasn't
 cheap.
 I'm
 reading
 uh


Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 Research
 React


from
 Paul
 Goldberg.
 Uh
 this
 acquisition


implies
 50
 times
 revenue
 is
 the
 purchase


price
 there.
 That's
 not
 cheap.


And
 it's
 an
 allcash
 deal.
 They're


they're
 just
 saying
 we're
 in.
