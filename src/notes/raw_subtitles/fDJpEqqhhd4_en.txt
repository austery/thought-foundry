One
 of the
 things
 that
 really
 worries
 me


is
 the
 way
 in
 which
 young
 men
 and
 young


women


have
 been
 increasingly
 persuaded
 that


their
 problems
 are
 the
 fault
 of
 the


other
 side.
 So
 on
 the
 right
 there's
 a


strong
 tendency
 I
 think
 to
 say
 to
 young


men,
 "Yeah,
 you're
 struggling."
 Which
 is


true.
 And
 you
 know
 why?
 It's
 because
 of


all
 those
 women
 uh
 taking
 jobs,
 taking


positions.
 Feminism's
 gone
 too
 far,
 etc.


and
 almost
 blame
 women
 or
 the
 rise
 of


women
 for
 the
 problems
 of
 men,
 which
 is


very
 reactionary.


But
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 true
 the
 other
 way


around,
 too.
 I
 think
 that
 many
 people
 on


the
 political
 left
 have
 said
 to
 young


women,
 "Sure,
 you're
 struggling.
 You're


not
 going
 to
 earn
 as
 much
 and
 the
 labor


market,
 it
 doesn't
 work
 as
 well
 for
 you,


and
 you
 quite
 rightly
 have
 may
 have
 some


fears
 for
 your
 own
 prospects."
 And
 you


know
 why?
 Because
 of
 those
 men.
 Because


of
 patriarchy,
 because
 of
 toxic


masculinity.
 And
 so,
 weirdly,


both
 sides
 have
 managed
 to
 politicize


young
 men
 and
 young
 women
 almost
 against


each
 other
 just
 at
 a
 moment
 in
 history


where
 you'd
 want
 young
 people
 to
 be
 arm-


in-armm
 against
 the
 structural
 problems


that
 they're
 facing
 in
 the
 economy.
 I'm


not
 saying
 it's
 a
 conspiracy,
 but
 if
 it


was
 a
 conspiracy,
 what
 you
 would
 do
 is


you'd
 find
 a
 way
 to
 persuade
 young
 men


and
 young
 women
 that
 what
 was
 happening


was
 the
 fault
 of
 of
 the
 of
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 gender
 divide
 rather
 than


the
 fault
 of
 the
 economy.


or
 our
 healthare
 system
 or
 the
 labor


market,
 right?
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 think
 in


different
 ways
 the
 politics
 of
 the
 of


gender
 have
 ended
 up
 becoming
 really
 way


too
 personal
 and
 not
 structural
 enough.
