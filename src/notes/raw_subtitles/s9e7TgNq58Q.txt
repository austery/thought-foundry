tired
 of
 working
 endless
 hours
 just
 to


see
 half
 of
 your
 paycheck
 disappearing


into
 taxes
 while
 the
 dream
 of
 owning
 a


property
 or
 multiple
 properties
 without


being
 in
 debt
 for
 30
 years
 feels
 like
 a


dream
 yeah
 that's
 exactly
 what
 got
 me


thinking
 about
 going
 to
 the
 Middle
 East


for
 work
 some
 time
 ago
 as
 well
 hi
 I'm


Daria
 I'm
 a
 product
 manager
 I've
 been


working
 in
 tech
 for
 the
 past
 eight
 years


and
 last
 year
 I
 landed
 four
 job
 offers


in
 the
 uee
 and
 did
 not
 accept
 any
 of


them
 here's


why
 I
 live
 in
 Toronto
 and
 I
 think
 every


Canadian
 working
 Tech
 has
 thought
 about


leaving
 at
 least
 once
 I'm
 talking
 about


leaving
 the
 country
 people
 in
 Canada
 are


heavily
 taxed
 and
 don't
 even
 get
 me


started
 on
 our
 government's
 decisions


over
 the
 past
 8
 years
 they've
 been
 let's


say
 questionable
 when
 you
 work
 in
 Tech


and
 start
 pulling
 in
 $2
 to
 $300,000
 or


above
 looking
 at
 your
 paycheck
 feels


like
 a
 heartbreak
 and
 you
 can't
 help
 but


think
 I
 could
 be
 so
 much
 richer
 and
 so


much
 happier
 if
 I
 Liv
 somewhere
 where


they
 wouldn't
 tax
 me
 like
 I
 have
 to
 pay


off
 the
 national
 debt
 popular
 choice
 for


many
 of
 us
 is
 the
 us
 but
 America
 doesn't


exactly
 scream
 Dreamland
 for
 everyone
 so


it's
 no
 surprise
 that
 moving
 abroad
 is


trending
 among
 Canadians
 there
 aren't


that
 many
 places
 on
 Earth
 with
 vibrant


textin
 safety
 low
 taxes
 and
 good


infrastructure
 so
 the
 UAE
 is
 an
 obvious


option
 fast
 forward
 to
 the
 end
 I
 decided


not
 to
 move
 not
 because
 it's
 not
 a
 great


opportunity
 it's
 just
 that
 there
 are


some
 truths
 and
 nuances
 that
 often
 do


make
 it
 to
 glossy
 LinkedIn
 stories
 so


let's
 talk
 about
 things
 people
 don't


often
 talk
 about
 in
 LinkedIn
 here's
 a


summary
 of
 my
 experience
 interviewing


for
 product
 management
 roles
 in
 the
 UAE


specifically
 in
 Dubai
 and
 Abu
 Dhabi
 the


highs
 the
 lows
 and
 the
 ultimate
 reason
 I


decided
 not
 to
 move
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


my
 search
 I
 hired
 a
 career
 consultant


specializing
 and
 helping
 people
 move
 to


the
 Middle
 East
 from
 North
 America
 or


Europe
 she
 was
 great
 she
 helped
 me
 work


in
 my
 resume
 on
 my
 LinkedIn
 on
 my


networking
 skills
 and
 I
 started
 building


my
 network
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 from


Toronto
 I
 highly
 recommend
 investing


money
 in
 consult
 ation
 because
 the


resume
 the
 things
 that
 go
 into
 your
 CV


your
 cover
 letter
 things
 like
 that
 are


different
 from
 what
 you
 would
 typically


put
 in
 North
 America
 you
 have
 to
 Rebrand


yourself
 for
 a
 different
 Market
 you
 have


to
 start
 building
 out
 your
 LinkedIn


specifically
 in
 that
 area
 and
 start


communicating
 with
 people
 before
 you
 go


the
 Middle
 East
 has
 a
 very
 different


work
 Communications
 culture
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 I
 know
 who
 have
 worked
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 in
 the
 past
 all
 of
 them
 have


told
 me
 that
 the
 communication
 culture


in
 the
 Middle
 East
 is
 different
 and
 I


was
 always
 wondering
 what
 exactly
 is


different
 about
 it
 it's
 a
 different


culture
 it's
 a
 different
 religion
 I
 mean


of
 course
 it's
 different
 but
 when
 people


would
 tell
 me
 that
 they
 wouldn't


necessarily
 explain
 what
 exactly
 was


different
 about
 it
 so
 I
 actually
 got
 to


learn
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 it
 as
 I
 was
 going


through
 the
 interviews
 the
 first
 thing


that
 stood
 out
 for
 me
 is
 that
 the


interview
 process
 takes
 a
 lot
 longer
 not


responding
 for
 weeks
 is
 quite
 common


when
 it
 first
 happened
 to
 me
 I
 thought


it
 was
 a
 one-off
 thing
 but
 then
 I


realized
 it's
 a
 pattern
 it's
 not
 because


there
 is
 anything
 wrong
 with
 you
 it's
 is


just
 the
 way
 people
 communicate
 it


simply
 takes
 longer
 at
 most
 companies


where
 I
 interviewed
 the
 gap
 between
 the


first
 and
 the
 second
 interview
 would
 be


3
 to
 4
 weeks
 there
 were
 at
 least
 six


companies
 I
 was
 interviewing
 at
 where


the
 process
 began
 in
 say
 October
 and
 end


it
 in
 December
 and
 I
 would
 get
 a


response
 from
 them
 end
 of
 January
 saying


that
 they're
 going
 to
 proceed
 with
 a


different
 candidate
 ghosting
 at
 last


stages
 happens
 a
 lot
 more
 frequently


than
 in
 North
 America
 again
 based
 on
 my


personal
 experience


there
 were
 two
 companies
 that
 I
 had
 a


final
 interview
 with
 that
 would
 simply


ghost
 me
 after
 the
 final
 interview
 not
 a


word
 not
 a
 yes
 not
 a
 no
 just
 completely


disappeared
 I
 messaged
 their
 people
 on


LinkedIn
 I
 emailed
 all
 of
 them
 I


followed
 up
 not
 a
 word
 back
 to
 the


interviews
 like
 I
 said
 interviews
 take


months
 in
 North
 America
 I'd
 say
 only


Fang
 comes
 close
 to
 that
 kind
 of


interview
 process
 duration
 because
 they


can't
 afford
 waiting
 for
 that
 long
 and


they're
 picking
 the
 cream
 of
 the
 crop
 I


cannot
 tell
 you
 why
 it's
 like
 that
 I


have
 never
 lived
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 so
 I


cannot
 tell
 you
 whether
 it's
 cultural
 or


not
 but
 I've
 built
 my
 career
 in
 North


America
 so
 I'm
 just
 sharing
 my


observations
 this
 would
 almost
 never


happen
 in
 America
 or
 in
 Canada
 if
 you're


in
 ring
 in
 Tech
 if
 it
 were
 to
 happen
 it


would
 be
 extremely
 unusual
 and
 rare
 I


bet
 you
 didn't
 expect
 this
 one
 it's
 less


money
 than
 most
 people
 think
 for
 some


reason
 I
 was
 under
 the
 impression
 that


being
 a
 product
 manager
 in
 the
 uee
 you


could
 make
 $10,000
 American
 easily


without
 having
 to
 be
 senior
 or
 principal


I
 think
 the
 uee
 also
 has
 a
 very
 good


marketing
 where
 in
 the
 preco
 times
 you


would
 hear
 about
 people
 moving
 to
 Dubai


and
 getting
 their
 rent
 reimbursed
 or
 the


company
 paying
 for
 their
 car
 or
 the


company
 paying
 for
 hotels
 accommodations


all
 kinds
 of
 things
 I
 personally
 know
 an


American
 engineer
 who
 moved
 there
 in


2018
 was
 making
 either
 double
 or
 triple


of
 his
 salary
 in
 the
 US
 and
 his
 rent
 was


covered
 by
 the
 company
 that
 changed
 when


interviewing
 for
 a
 product
 manager
 at


large
 Middle
 Eastern
 tech
 companies
 the


most
 money
 I
 was
 able
 to
 negotiate
 was


$95,000
 American
 and
 I
 was
 told
 it
 would


be
 a
 big
 stretch
 for
 them
 remember
 all


of
 that
 money
 is
 taxfree
 well
 not


taxfree
 it's
 just
 the
 income
 tax
 is
 0%


this
 is
 surely
 more
 than
 you'd
 make
 in


Canada
 or
 in
 the
 US
 outside
 of


California
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 your


salaries
 going
 to
 Triple
 you
 can
 find


places
 in
 the
 US
 where
 you'd
 be
 making


more
 than
 that


and
 have
 a
 low
 income
 tax
 example


Washington
 State
 and
 Texas
 out
 of
 four


offers
 I
 was
 able
 to
 land
 in
 the
 UAE


three
 were
 different
 from
 what
 we


initially
 agreed
 upon
 and
 one
 got


revoked
 the
 day
 after
 I
 got
 it
 for
 the


two
 that
 were
 different
 when
 I
 got
 the


offer
 the
 salary
 in
 the
 offer
 was


different
 than
 what
 I
 negotiated
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 interview
 process
 it


was
 obviously
 lower
 and
 they
 would
 not


be
 willing
 to
 renegotiate
 for
 instance


there
 was
 one
 place
 where
 I
 negotiated


11,000
 ,000
 a
 month
 but
 got
 offered
 nine


instead
 when
 I
 asked
 why
 there
 was
 a


discrepancy
 the
 answer
 was
 would'
 be


paying
 for
 your
 tickets
 home
 once
 a
 year


and
 there
 are
 other
 perks
 that
 we'd
 be


offering
 paying
 for
 tickets
 is
 a
 common


perk
 in
 the
 UAE
 many
 places
 offer
 that


but
 it
 doesn't
 justify
 contract


augmentation
 the
 offer
 that
 got
 revoked


was
 because
 they
 decided
 to
 Outsource


the
 role
 to
 a
 different
 country
 the


country
 that
 they
 Outsource
 to
 is
 also


in
 the
 Middle
 East
 they
 have
 cheaper


engineers
 and
 cheaper
 PMS
 they
 were
 very


apologetic
 about
 it
 but
 yet
 that
 happens


too
 layoffs
 is
 not
 only
 a
 North
 American


problem
 as
 I
 was
 going
 through
 the


interviews
 several
 companies
 put
 hiring


and
 pause
 due
 to
 layoffs
 so
 if
 you
 think


this
 is
 isolated
 to
 North
 America
 and


Europe
 know
 that
 it's
 a
 common
 thing
 in


other
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 as
 well
 in


Canada
 in
 the
 US
 it
 is
 common
 to


Outsource
 engineering
 and
 product


management
 resources
 to
 Latin
 America


and
 India
 in
 the
 UAE
 they
 prefer
 India


and
 Egypt
 I
 did
 not
 accept
 any
 of
 the


offers
 because
 I
 thought
 that
 starting
 a


professional
 relationship
 by
 changing


the
 conditions
 in
 the
 contract
 that
 were


discussed
 months
 ago
 was
 not
 a
 very
 good


sign
 but
 I'm
 not
 discouraging
 anybody


from
 doing
 it
 it's
 a
 great
 opportunity


for
 people
 who
 want
 to
 make
 more
 out
 of


their
 career
 but
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 it
 is


a
 very
 different
 region
 with
 a
 very


different
 culture
 and
 don't
 treat
 the


interview
 process
 the
 way
 you
 treat
 it


in
 North
 America
 if
 you're
 considering


moving
 to
 the
 Middle
 East
 I
 highly


recommend
 exploring
 Saudi
 Arabia
 as
 it's


not
 nearly
 saturated
 as
 the
 UAE
 at
 least


for
 now
 if
 you're
 prioritizing
 money
 and


Investments
 over
 other
 things
 in
 life
 at


this
 particular
 point
 which
 is
 perfectly


normal
 I
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time
 it's


definitely
 worth
 considering
 thanks
 for


listening
 I
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful
 if
 you


also
 have
 experience
 looking
 or
 working


in
 the
 Middle
 East
 in
 text
 specifically


I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 from
 you
 please


drop
 your
 story
 in
 the
 comments
 below


thanks
 for
 listening
 till
 next
 time
 bye
