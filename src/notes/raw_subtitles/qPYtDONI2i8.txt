How
 do
 teachers
 and
 students
 handle


discussing
 sensitive
 issues?
 Is


political
 bias
 a
 problem
 in
 schools?
 I


asked
 Muna
 Kadri,
 York
 Region
 president


of
 the
 Ontario
 Secondary
 School
 Teachers


Federation,
 and
 Sarah
 Mora,
 a
 recent


high
 school
 graduate,
 to
 share
 what
 it's


like
 to
 talk
 politics
 at
 school.


Muna,
 Sarah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


joining
 us
 on
 the
 program
 and
 thanks
 for


joining
 us
 in
 our
 makeshift
 studio.
 How


are
 you
 guys
 doing?


>> Great.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 us.
 It's


wonderful.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having


us.


>> All
 right,
 so
 we're
 here
 to
 talk
 about


sort
 of
 navigating
 political
 speech
 in


the
 classroom.
 Um,
 I
 want
 to
 know
 from
 a


teacher's
 perspective,
 do
 teachers
 feel


a
 chill
 on
 what
 they
 can
 discuss
 in
 a


classroom?


>> Well,
 what
 we
 discuss
 is
 guided
 by


curriculum?
 So,
 the
 ministry
 tells
 us


what
 it
 is
 that
 we're
 discussing
 in
 the


classroom,
 but
 depending
 on
 the
 climate.


So,
 to
 give
 you
 an example,
 during


COVID,
 there
 were
 some
 polarizing


issues.
 The
 curriculum
 guides
 what
 we


teach,
 but
 we
 know
 that
 there
 are
 some


pressures
 when
 there's
 external
 issues


in
 the
 community.
 And
 so
 it
 it's


difficult
 to
 navigate
 some
 issues


because
 of
 those
 pressures.
 But
 again,


we
 still
 have
 to
 teach
 the
 curriculum


and
 that's
 what
 we
 do.


>> You
 bring
 up
 CO
 as
 one
 example.
 I
 am


curious
 um
 politically
 a
 very


contentious
 time.
 Um
 politics,
 how
 do


you
 navigate
 something
 as
 big
 as
 what


we're
 seeing
 sort
 of
 south
 of
 the
 border


and
 sort
 of
 what's
 happening
 here
 in


Canada?


>> We're
 grounded
 in
 curriculum.
 So
 I
 come


back
 to
 the
 same
 answer
 and
 it's
 funny


you
 say
 that
 right
 now
 is
 a
 particularly


contentious
 time.
 You
 know
 I've
 been


teaching
 for
 almost
 20
 years
 now.
 Every


time
 was
 a
 particularly
 contentious
 time


and
 so
 we
 encourage
 students
 to
 evaluate


sources,
 think
 critically
 and
 we
 ground


ourselves
 in
 the
 curriculum.
 So


sometimes
 it's
 tough
 for
 students
 to


deal
 with
 new
 materials
 because
 they
 are


not
 particularly
 in
 line
 with
 what


they've
 known
 for
 life.
 But
 it's
 great


when
 they
 get
 to
 experience
 new
 thoughts


and
 ideas
 based
 on
 what
 we
 are
 guided
 by


through
 the
 curriculum.
 All
 right,


Sarah.
 Now,
 you've
 graduated
 uh
 but
 uh


and
 you're
 in
 university
 now,
 but
 what


was
 it
 like
 in
 high
 school
 uh
 around


sort
 of
 those
 conversations
 that
 weren't


necessarily
 curriculum
 uh
 maybe


curriculum
 adjacent
 perhaps,
 but
 how
 did


you
 sort
 of
 navigate
 those
 conversations


and
 how
 would
 you
 talk
 about
 them
 in
 the


classroom?


>> That's
 a
 really
 great
 question
 and
 I


think
 that
 like
 both
 of
 you
 guys
 made


really
 good
 points.
 Like
 every
 every


time
 is
 like
 a
 particularly
 contentious


time.
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be


something
 going
 on
 politically
 and
 some


conflict
 or
 crisis
 and
 I
 mean
 like


education
 itself
 is
 inherently


political.
 So
 even
 making
 decisions


within
 um
 how
 you
 communicate
 with
 your


students
 and
 things
 like
 that
 that
 is


inherently
 political.
 Um
 I
 I
 think
 that


I
 am
 a
 more
 particularly
 politically
 um


oriented
 person
 than
 some
 of
 my


classmates.
 So
 that
 was
 definitely


something
 that
 I
 focused
 on
 in
 high


school
 when
 I
 was
 in
 uh
 classes
 like


history
 or
 geography
 or
 economics
 that


was
 definitely
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 my


mind.
 Um
 I
 think
 I
 was
 I'm
 very
 grateful


to
 have
 had
 teachers
 who
 were
 very
 open


to
 fostering
 these
 kinds
 of


conversations.
 Um
 during
 the
 US
 election


for
 example
 um
 last
 year
 I
 was
 um
 like


head
 of
 the
 history
 club.
 So
 we


organized
 um
 a
 kind
 of
 lesson
 after


school
 about
 how
 US
 politics
 works,
 how


the
 election
 works
 in
 the
 US
 um
 and
 what


to
 expect
 for
 this
 election.
 And
 my


history
 teacher
 actually
 was
 the
 one
 who


led
 it
 and
 he
 was
 very
 open
 to
 these


conversations.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 what
 was


most
 important
 about
 all
 of
 those


conversations
 is
 that
 you
 recognize
 that


you
 can't
 separate
 yourself
 from
 bias.


But
 again,
 like
 learning
 how
 to
 think


critically,
 that
 is
 definitely
 something


that
 all
 of
 my
 teachers
 did
 a
 really


great
 job
 at
 pointing
 out,
 you
 know,


like
 trying
 to
 um
 separate
 the
 bias
 from


the
 value
 that
 we
 ascribe
 to
 these


things
 and
 and
 just
 giving
 us
 the
 most


um
 objective
 stance
 in
 a
 very
 subjective


um
 landscape.


Muna,
 I
 want
 to
 understand,
 have
 there


been
 teachers
 who
 have
 been
 disciplined


um
 for,
 you
 know,
 political
 speech
 in


the
 classroom
 and
 how
 has
 the
 OSTF


helped?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 can't
 speak
 to
 all
 of
 Ontario


in
 terms
 of
 discipline
 and
 our


definitions
 of
 discipline,
 but
 have


there
 been
 conversations
 with
 teachers


about
 concerns
 about
 what
 is
 deemed


political
 speech
 in
 the
 classroom?
 And


so
 I
 think
 you
 brought
 up
 a
 great
 point


is
 everything
 is
 political.
 And
 so
 in


terms
 of
 our
 role
 as
 OSSTF,
 we
 support


teachers
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 do
 you
 navigate


curriculum
 during
 times
 where
 a
 topic


might
 be
 challenging.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to


tell
 you
 from
 supporting
 3,500
 members


in
 York
 Region.
 They're
 all
 trying
 to


get
 it
 right
 in
 terms
 of
 helping


students
 make
 their
 own
 decisions,


helping
 students
 assess
 resources,


helping
 students
 navigate
 difficult


conversations.
 And
 so,
 while
 like
 you


said,
 there's
 a
 chill
 at
 different
 times


over
 different
 issues,
 our
 role
 as
 a


federation
 is
 to
 help
 our
 colleagues


work
 through
 the
 curriculum
 in
 a
 way


that
 supports
 students
 in
 the
 best
 way


possible.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 a
 product
 of


that
 sitting
 beside
 me
 who's
 doing


incredible
 work
 partly
 because
 of
 the


education
 that
 she
 received
 in
 a
 public


education
 setting.


>> In
 terms
 of
 the
 supports,
 what
 are
 some


of
 the
 calls
 that
 you
 were
 hearing
 from


some
 of
 the
 members?


>> So,
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 Much
 of


the
 Ontario
 curriculum
 in
 the
 social


sciences
 talks
 about
 talking
 about


current
 events.
 So
 we'll
 get
 a
 call


saying
 how
 do
 we
 talk
 about
 AB
 and
 C
 as


a
 current
 event
 and
 so
 we
 always
 come


back
 to
 is
 it
 in
 your
 curriculum
 okay


yes
 it's
 in
 UI
 curriculum
 then
 we
 talk


about
 are
 you
 bringing
 in
 a
 variety
 of


resources
 are
 you
 bringing
 in
 students


lived
 experiences
 are
 you
 trying
 to


foster
 ways
 so
 that
 students
 can
 bring


their
 own
 resources
 in
 and
 critically


assess
 those
 resources
 we
 want
 to
 help


students
 become
 adults
 who
 can
 integrate


in
 a
 world
 and
 have
 political


discussions
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 constructive


and
 productive
 for
 society


I
 want
 to
 have
 a
 better
 When
 I
 was
 in


high
 school,
 cell
 phones
 weren't
 really


around,
 you
 know,
 uh
 they
 were
 around,


but
 they
 weren't
 really
 allowed
 in
 the


classroom.
 People
 weren't
 recording
 uh


videos.
 You
 can
 see
 things
 that
 are


happening
 in
 the
 classroom
 that
 you


would
 never
 see
 before.
 And
 I
 I
 am


curious,
 do
 do
 students
 ever
 record


teachers
 at
 the
 time
 that
 you
 were
 in


school
 and
 post
 videos
 on
 social
 media?


>> Um,
 okay.
 So,
 I
 personally
 I've
 never


seen
 something
 like
 that.
 like
 I
 I


understand
 that
 might
 be
 a
 concern,


especially
 when
 you're
 having
 a


politically
 charged
 conversation
 um
 or


something
 that
 that
 might
 be
 a
 little


bit
 more
 vulnerable
 with
 your
 students,


you
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 And
 I
 I've
 never


seen
 any
 of
 my
 peers
 or
 classmates
 doing


something
 like
 that.
 Of
 course,
 like


there
 have
 been
 times
 where
 we'll
 take


photos
 with
 our
 teachers
 or
 sometimes


like
 share
 things
 amongst
 each
 other,


but
 I've
 never
 seen
 anyone
 try
 and
 um
 go


out
 of
 their
 way
 to
 harm
 someone's
 image


like
 that.
 Um
 now,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that


this
 doesn't
 happen.
 Of
 course,
 I
 have


very
 like
 myopic
 lens
 based
 on
 my
 high


school
 experience
 and
 the
 people
 that
 I


grew
 up
 with.
 Um
 but
 in
 my
 experience,
 I


haven't
 seen
 something
 like
 that.


>> Lena,


>> please
 don't
 would
 be
 my
 first
 thought.


Uh
 my
 second
 thought
 is
 is
 we
 work


really
 hard
 to
 create
 what
 we
 call


classroom
 norms
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 a


semester
 so
 that
 students
 feel
 safe
 to


be
 able
 to
 have
 really
 good


conversations
 in
 classroom.
 And
 to
 think


that
 somebody
 could
 videotape
 as


students
 are
 experimenting
 with
 thoughts


and
 ideas
 as
 a
 teacher
 who's
 protective


of
 the
 students
 in
 my
 classroom.
 It
 it


terrifies
 me
 that
 that's
 a
 thought
 they


could
 have.
 And
 and
 we
 have


unfortunately
 an
 underfunded
 system


where
 I
 have
 30
 or
 40
 kids
 in
 a
 class


and
 we're
 trying
 to
 have
 a
 conversation


and
 you
 catch
 a
 snippet
 in
 a
 moment
 of


chaos
 that's
 so
 unproductive
 and
 harmful


to
 the
 students
 I'm
 meant
 to
 protect
 in


my
 class.


>> Does
 that
 put
 the
 a
 chill
 on
 what
 to


teach?


>> Yeah,
 it
 absolutely
 does.
 And
 my
 primary


role
 as
 a
 teacher
 is
 to
 protect
 the


students
 in
 my
 classroom
 and
 doing


something
 like
 that
 which
 violates
 I'm


going
 to
 guess
 every
 single
 board


policy.
 I
 know
 in
 my
 board
 it
 violates


board
 policy
 really
 puts
 students
 in
 a


place
 where
 they
 don't
 feel
 like
 they


can
 have
 vulnerable
 conversations
 as


they're
 learning
 because
 they're
 worried


someone's
 going
 to
 f
 uh
 film.
 So,
 I'm


really
 pleased
 to
 see
 that
 we're
 taking


a
 stronger
 tone
 on
 cell
 phones
 to
 make


sure
 things
 like
 that
 aren't
 happening


in
 class.


>> Who
 who
 loses
 out
 um
 in
 that
 in
 what


sort
 of
 technology
 can
 create
 in
 that


particular
 example
 where
 you
 can't
 have


these
 conversations?


>> Students.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 read
 a
 tweet


from
 a
 reporter
 the
 other
 day
 about
 he


put
 out
 a
 tweet
 and
 it
 was
 nuanced
 about


something
 and
 then
 there
 was
 vitrial


that
 came
 at
 him.
 No
 nuanced


conversation.
 And
 I
 thought
 to
 myself,


we're
 losing
 the
 ability
 to
 have


political
 discourse


>> because
 we're
 not
 finding
 places
 where


we
 can
 practice
 it
 in
 a
 safe
 way.
 If
 we


say,
 "Well,
 you
 can't
 talk
 about
 this
 in


school."
 Where
 are
 you
 going
 to
 learn
 to


have
 a
 respectful
 conversation
 with


nuance
 and
 disagreement
 if
 it's
 not
 in


the
 safe
 environment
 of
 a
 classroom?


>> Yeah,
 pick
 up
 on


>> that
 is
 such
 a
 good
 point.
 I
 think
 that


um
 schools
 like
 and
 and
 just
 education


as
 a
 whole
 is
 like
 the
 foundation
 for


how
 you
 grow
 up
 and
 how
 you
 begin
 to


think
 and
 function
 as
 a
 member
 of
 our


society.
 And
 you
 know
 even
 I
 I
 I'm
 a


fresh
 university
 student
 so
 I'm
 in
 my


first
 year
 and
 people
 talk
 about
 the


ivory
 tower
 and
 how
 it's
 a
 very
 like


it's
 a
 vacuum.
 It's
 a
 secluded
 space
 and


I
 think
 that
 that
 can
 be
 a
 great
 thing


and
 I
 think
 that's
 high
 school
 is
 also
 a


great
 place
 for
 students
 to
 facilitate


conversation
 where
 they
 can
 share
 their


opinions
 freely
 and
 openly
 and
 and
 be


safe
 in
 that
 environment.
 It's
 a
 kind
 of


public
 sphere
 where
 you
 are
 able
 to


share
 whatever
 you
 want
 and
 have


productive
 discourse
 not
 limited
 to


whatever
 um
 like
 social
 economic
 factors


that
 might
 confine
 you
 in
 the
 future
 as


an
 adult
 to
 speak
 your
 truth
 and


advocate
 for
 yourself
 in
 your
 own
 views


and
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 foster


critical
 thinking
 abilities
 the
 ability


to
 evaluate
 the
 current
 events
 going
 on


around
 you
 it's
 just


>> it
 is
 the
 place
 to
 have
 those


conversations
 so
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense


that
 they're
 under
 threat
 and
 that
 they


are
 um
 being
 you
 know
 there
 is
 a
 chill


like
 in
 some
 ways.


>> I
 want
 to
 pick
 up
 on
 a
 a
 comment
 that


Muna
 had
 made
 but
 I
 want
 to
 get
 a
 better


understanding
 of
 the
 conversations
 that


you
 felt
 that
 you
 wanted
 to
 have
 in
 high


school
 but
 that
 you
 couldn't
 have.
 Um


whether
 it's
 with
 your
 classmates


because
 they
 felt
 uncomfortable
 around


having
 that
 conversation
 or
 whether
 it


was
 your
 teachers.
 What
 were
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 you
 were
 yearning
 to
 just


like
 can
 we
 talk?
 Something
 happened


over
 the
 weekend
 or
 something
 happened.


I
 really
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 it.


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 I
 like
 I
 said
 I
 I
 think
 I


got
 particularly
 lucky
 with
 who
 my


teachers
 were
 and
 everything
 like
 that.


I
 think
 that
 um


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 political
 apathy
 um


especially
 in
 um
 my
 generation
 and
 um


even
 in
 like
 like
 a
 few
 years
 older
 than


me.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 partially
 because


conversations
 like
 this
 are
 not
 being


encouraged
 as
 much
 and
 there's
 so
 much


political
 polarization.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 have
 those
 conversations


when
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 guidance.
 Which


is
 why
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 really
 great
 to


have
 educators
 like
 Muna
 who
 are
 like


encouraging
 that
 that
 that
 conversation.


And
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 would
 freely
 speak
 my


mind.
 I
 I
 did
 not
 I
 did
 not
 feel
 like
 I


was
 being
 blockaded
 from
 having
 the


conversations
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 have.
 But


that
 does
 come
 with
 consequence
 of


course
 when
 you
 have
 when
 you
 have


conversations
 that
 are
 um
 politically


charged
 that
 people
 are
 emotional
 about.


You
 might
 get
 into
 arguments
 and
 things


like
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I


think
 the
 most
 heated
 time
 at
 my
 school


um
 or
 surrounding
 any
 particular


conversation
 was
 the
 US
 election
 prior


to
 and
 afterward.
 Um,
 of
 course,
 my


teachers
 didn't
 try
 to
 um


outwardly
 tell
 tell
 us
 their
 opinions,


but
 um
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 disagreements


and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 discourse
 um


surrounding
 the
 US
 election.
 And
 I
 think


that
 that
 was
 a
 great
 time
 where
 me
 and


my
 classmates
 experienced
 healthy


political
 discourse
 because
 we
 were
 also


being
 taught
 um
 how
 to
 understand
 the


information
 that
 was
 being
 presented
 to


us
 and
 how
 to
 consume
 it
 in
 the
 proper


way.


>> All
 right,
 I
 want
 to
 read
 a
 memo.
 Uh


this
 was
 sent
 out
 by
 the
 former


education
 minister
 Jill
 Dunlop
 last
 year


to
 school
 boards
 across
 the
 province


around
 the
 time
 of
 the
 first
 anniversary


of
 the
 October
 7th
 attack
 which
 I
 will


read
 in
 part.
 The
 focus
 in
 our
 schools


must
 always
 be
 on
 learning.
 This
 means


our
 schools
 and
 school
 related


activities
 should
 never
 be
 used
 as


vehicles
 for
 political
 protests
 that


enable
 inflammatory,
 discriminatory
 and


hateful
 content.
 While
 everyone
 is


entitled
 to
 their
 own
 political


opinions,
 they
 are
 not
 entitled
 to


disseminate
 political
 biases
 into
 our


classrooms.
 We
 did
 reach
 out
 to
 the


Ministry
 of
 Education
 for
 comment,
 but


we
 did
 not
 hear
 back
 in
 time
 for
 this


taping.
 But
 Muna,
 how
 do
 you
 interpret


this
 memo
 from
 the
 ministry?


>> Well,
 unclear
 at
 times,
 and
 so
 I


understand
 that
 they're
 trying
 to


promote
 a
 safe
 learning
 environment,


which
 every
 educator
 is
 committed
 to.


Like
 that
 is
 our
 goal,
 keeping
 students


safe
 as
 much
 as
 possible.
 Um,
 but
 more


clarity
 would
 have
 been
 appreciated


because
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 I'm
 a


politics
 teacher.
 Much
 of
 what
 we
 have


to
 teach
 is
 political
 biases.


>> Exactly.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about,
 you


know,
 some
 of
 some
 very
 difficult
 topics


and
 some
 terrible
 things
 that
 happened


historically.
 And
 so,
 does
 that
 memo


direct
 us
 not
 to
 teach
 curriculum?


>> I'm
 I'm
 hoping
 not.
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 would


hope
 that
 the
 minister
 isn't
 sort
 of


sort
 of
 throwing
 away
 curriculum.
 It's


just
 um
 a
 lack
 of
 clarity
 is
 an
 issue


and
 for
 something
 that's
 so
 important.
 I


think
 that
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 for


the
 minister,
 you
 know,
 bring
 experts
 to


the
 table,
 bring
 teachers
 and
 education


workers
 to
 the
 table.
 Let's
 unpack


what's
 happening
 in
 schools
 and
 finding


ways
 where
 we
 can
 work
 within
 the


curriculum
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 students


are
 having
 their
 needs
 needs
 met
 in
 a


way
 that
 nobody
 feels
 unsafe
 in
 the


classroom
 because
 that's
 the
 goal,


right?
 You
 know,
 safety
 and
 learning


hand
 in
 hand
 and
 trust
 teachers
 like
 we


put
 student
 needs
 first.
 If
 the
 Minister


of
 Education
 would
 trust
 us,
 I
 think


that
 they
 would
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 faith
 in


the
 system,
 which
 they
 should
 have
 as


the
 Minister
 of
 Education.


you've
 touched
 on
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 um


in
 your
 experience.
 It
 seems
 like
 you


had
 a
 a
 number
 of
 great
 teachers.
 Um
 we


all
 have
 our
 biases.
 It's
 how
 we


approach
 it.
 We
 are
 wearing
 many
 hats
 as


a
 journalist,
 as
 a
 teacher.
 Uh
 did
 you


ever
 feel
 like
 teachers
 had
 a
 bias?


>> Um
 I
 think
 that
 it's


a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 so
 worried
 about
 um


the
 dissemination
 of
 political


narratives
 and
 biases
 in
 classrooms,


especially
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 talking


about
 political
 speech
 in
 schools.
 Um,


and
 I
 I
 just
 find
 it
 a
 bit
 senseless
 to


think
 that
 you
 can
 have
 a
 biasless


classroom.
 I
 think
 that
 everyone


inherently
 has
 bias.
 If
 you
 decide
 that


something
 is
 valuable
 and
 worth
 talking


about,
 that
 is
 your
 bias
 toward
 that


subject.
 You're
 ascribing
 it
 value
 and


therefore
 you
 are
 biased
 towards
 it.
 So


I
 I
 do
 think
 of
 course
 all
 my
 teachers


had
 bias.
 I'm
 a
 I
 am
 biased.
 Everyone


has
 their
 biases.
 But
 I
 think
 it
 depends


on
 how
 you
 approach
 that
 and
 if
 you
 make


your
 students
 aware,
 the
 people
 that


you're
 talking
 to
 aware
 um
 that
 what
 you


are
 saying
 is
 not
 necessarily
 objective


and
 that
 it's
 not
 universal
 or
 um
 you


know
 there
 is
 there
 are
 certain


judgments
 that
 can
 be
 made
 on
 either


side.
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 really


important
 um
 in
 any
 conversation,
 not


even
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 political
 speech,


but
 um
 for
 example,
 I
 took
 a
 lot
 of


history
 classes
 in
 high
 school
 and
 that


is
 something
 that
 was
 stressed
 so
 much


um
 to
 us,
 especially
 when
 we
 were


reading
 from
 diff
 different
 authors,


different
 sources
 and
 and
 things
 like


that.


>> Um
 so
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 of
 course


teachers
 would
 have
 political
 bias.
 they


will
 have
 their
 own
 personal
 experiences


that
 in
 influence
 their
 opinions,
 but
 I


also
 think
 that
 if
 if
 handled
 well,


those
 conversations
 can
 be
 extremely


productive
 and
 they
 can
 still
 um


navigate
 conversations
 with
 students


without
 necessarily
 imposing
 their
 own


narrative
 or
 opinions
 on
 them.
 Muna,
 um,


for
 the
 educators
 who
 are
 going
 to
 be


watching
 this
 and
 listening
 to
 this,


what
 is
 a
 a
 takeaway,
 um,
 in
 terms
 of


how
 they
 handle
 sensitive
 topics
 in
 the


classroom?


>> Keep
 doing
 what
 you're
 doing
 because


you're
 so
 good.
 You're
 so
 good
 at
 it.


And
 when
 I
 sit
 beside
 a
 student
 who


graduated
 from
 our
 public
 education


system
 who's
 absolutely
 rocking
 it
 in


every
 way,
 it's
 a
 testament
 to
 the


incredible
 work
 that
 the
 60,000
 OSSTF


members
 in
 Ontario
 do.
 And
 so
 keep


approaching
 public
 education
 from
 a


place
 of
 caring
 and
 kindness
 and
 keep


being
 those
 incredible
 curriculum


experts
 who
 put
 students
 first.
 And
 so


my
 message
 isn't
 so
 much
 to
 the
 teachers


in
 our
 province
 who
 I
 know
 are
 putting


students
 first.
 It's
 to
 the
 Minister
 of


Education
 is
 to
 build
 confidence
 in
 a


system
 that's
 working
 so
 well
 for
 our


students
 and
 to
 fund
 it
 appropriately
 so


that
 you
 can
 have
 these
 conversations
 in


your
 classroom
 without
 40
 other
 students


in
 the
 class.
 Can
 you
 imagine
 a
 debate?


you
 experienced
 it
 with
 40
 students


discussing
 something
 really,
 you
 know,


you
 know,
 really
 difficult.
 Fund
 our


schools
 appropriately,
 smaller
 class


sizes,
 trust
 your
 educators,
 and
 build


confidence
 among
 families.
 I
 send
 my


child
 to
 school
 because
 I
 love
 our


public
 education
 system.
 So,
 message
 not


to
 my
 colleagues,
 it's
 the
 minister
 of


education.


>> All
 right,
 Sarah,
 you
 got
 the
 last


question.
 uh
 you're
 in
 university
 now
 as


we
 mentioned
 and
 you
 made
 it
 very
 clear


that
 you
 were
 you
 didn't
 feel
 like
 you


um
 you
 know
 were
 uh
 silenced
 or
 or


anything
 in
 high
 school
 but
 do
 you
 feel


freer
 now
 that
 you're
 in
 university
 in


terms
 of
 what
 you
 can
 say?


>> Um
 I
 think
 that
 um
 just
 being
 in


university
 um
 you
 are
 in
 a
 much
 more


concentrated
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are


very
 interested
 in
 whatever
 um
 class


you're
 in.
 So
 I'm
 taking
 like
 four


ethics
 classes.
 We
 are
 debating
 every


single
 day
 topics.


>> Um
 and
 it
 is
 exactly
 the
 kind
 of


conversations
 that
 are
 taboo
 in
 in
 in


schools
 in
 high
 school
 and
 things
 like


that
 and
 things
 that
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Ed


education
 or
 the
 Ford
 government
 that


they
 don't
 want
 you
 to
 talk
 about
 and


and
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 I
 I'm
 watching


as
 I
 just
 graduated
 from
 high
 school
 and


I'm
 seeing
 all
 of
 these
 things
 like
 the


potential
 removal
 of
 school
 trustees
 and


and
 you
 know
 like
 um
 trying
 to
 decide


what
 students
 or
 teachers
 can
 and
 cannot


talk
 about
 in
 schools.
 And
 that's
 really


concerning
 to
 me
 because
 I
 did
 have
 a


great
 experience
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 my


education
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see


students
 or
 teachers
 lose
 their
 autonomy


in
 that
 in
 that
 sense
 and
 what
 they
 can


talk
 about
 in
 their
 freedom.
 Um
 but


yeah,
 in
 terms
 of
 university,
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 surrounded
 by
 a
 lot


of
 like-minded
 peers,
 people
 who
 are


interested
 in
 politics,
 people
 who
 are


interested
 in
 um
 debating
 these
 things.


So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 if
 you
 constitute


freedom
 as
 what
 people
 are
 more
 willing


to
 talk
 about
 because
 that's
 what


they're
 interested
 in,
 then
 yes.


>> All
 right,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 leave
 it


there.
 Sarah
 Muna,
 really
 appreciate


your
 time
 and
 I
 think
 we
 can
 both
 agree


that
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 good
 hands.
 The


future
 is
 taken
 care
 of.
 We're
 good.


Thank
 you.
