He
 opens
 a
 closet
 and
 there's
 like
 all


the
 bananas
 felling
 off
 because
 there


was
 one
 guy's
 only
 eating
 huge
 bananas.


He
 open
 another
 closet
 is
 another


mattress
 with
 other
 guys
 sleeping
 a


second
 closet
 and
 say
 okay
 this
 is
 real.


We
 had
 no
 money.
 We
 we
 we
 we
 just
 take


600
 bucks
 last
 left
 to
 go
 to
 a
 United


flight
 and
 we
 had
 90
 days
 to
 just
 uh


make
 it
 or
 break
 it.
 We
 knew
 that
 if
 we


couldn't
 race
 we
 would
 go
 back
 to
 Italy


broke
 and
 that
 was
 it.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 don't
 know
 or
 maybe
 don't


appreciate
 how
 fast
 Kong
 grew
 when
 it


actually
 happened.
 So
 there
 was
 seven


years
 of
 starvation,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 just
 basically
 wasn't
 working.
 Every


year
 we
 do
 the
 founders
 award.
 The


founders
 award
 is
 2,555


stock
 to
 the
 best
 employee
 of
 the


company.


>> Why
 that
 is
 255
 days
 of
 struggle.
 It's


just
 symbolic.
 But
 to
 remember
 seven


years
 of
 struggle,
 every
 year
 is
 a


retro.


>> So
 AI
 is
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Kong


which
 was
 previously
 mass
 shape
 and
 we


are
 covering
 his
 background
 from
 a


garage
 in
 Milan
 uh
 to
 now
 being
 the
 CEO


of
 a
 atscale
 company
 with
 I
 dare
 say
 IPO


ambitions
 at
 some
 point.


>> Long
 way
 long
 way
 to
 go
 but
 that's
 one


of
 the
 steps
 along
 the
 way.


>> Ambitions.
 All
 right.
 So,
 so
 you're


doing
 this
 kind
 of
 API
 thing.
 You
 come


to
 the
 US
 on
 a
 tourist
 visa.


>> Tourist
 visa.
 Yeah.


>> And
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 raise


>> 90
 days.


>> Was
 the
 idea
 to
 raise
 funding?


>> Yeah.
 We
 had
 no
 money.
 We
 we
 we
 we
 just


take
 600
 bucks
 last
 left
 to
 go
 to
 a


United
 flight
 through
 Cincinnati.
 We


went
 through
 secondary
 room.
 Uh
 we


landed
 up
 and
 we
 landed
 up
 through
 sorry


Atlanta
 first
 time.
 Cincinnati
 was


secondary
 room.
 And
 then
 we
 went
 right


arrived
 to
 San
 Francisco
 and
 um
 and
 we


had
 90
 days
 to
 just
 uh
 make
 it
 or
 break


it.
 We
 knew
 that
 if
 we
 couldn't
 race,
 we


would
 go
 back
 to
 Italy
 broke
 and
 that


was
 it.


>> So
 did
 you
 raise
 those?


>> Yeah,
 we
 raised
 two
 weeks
 before


departure.


>> You
 you
 raised
 in
 those


>> angel
 rounds.
 Uh
 it
 was
 you
 know
 that


we're
 talking
 about
 decade
 ago,
 right?


Small
 checks.
 It
 was
 50K
 round
 was


defining
 YouTube
 teams.


>> All
 right.


>> There
 we
 go.
 And
 here's
 a
 funny
 story


like


>> how
 did
 you
 get
 introduced
 to
 that?
 Uh


okay
 that's
 that's
 um
 so
 there's
 two


interesting
 thing
 that
 you
 say
 can
 you


redo
 it
 again
 I
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 redo
 it


again.
 Yeah.
 So
 number
 one
 is
 we
 went
 to


the
 Stanford
 entrepreneurship
 week
 at


that
 time
 Stanford
 was
 doing
 the


Stanford
 entrepreneurship
 week
 in


February


>> and
 they
 were
 cool.
 You
 made
 all


entrepreneurs
 all
 the
 VC
 were
 coming


there
 and
 um
 there
 was
 this


entrepreneurship
 mixer
 big
 party.
 We


arrived
 we
 left
 late.
 There
 was
 a
 there


was
 a
 big
 at
 that
 point
 it
 was
 all
 paper


with
 all
 the
 email
 and
 the
 registration.


We
 steal
 the
 things
 with
 all
 the
 email


and
 the
 registration
 and
 we
 walk
 home


with
 that.
 And
 that
 night
 till
 5:00
 a.m.


I
 write
 all
 the
 400
 emails.


>> Wow.


>> About,
 hey,
 you
 need
 to
 know
 about


Masha.
 We
 didn't
 have
 time
 to
 catch
 up


at
 the
 mixer,
 but
 I'm
 happy
 to
 give
 you


a
 pitch
 tomorrow.


>> Wow.


>> I
 think


>> 470
 didn't
 reply.


>> Uh
 30
 reply
 and
 10
 were
 kind
 of


interested.
 At
 the
 end
 five
 or
 six
 went


to
 meet
 us


>> and
 then
 this
 one
 person


>> told
 like
 Kevin
 Donahu
 who
 was
 the
 the


VP
 one
 of
 VP
 funding
 team
 of
 YouTube


came
 to
 our


>> Kevin
 Donahu


>> Kevin


>> and
 then
 he
 started
 a
 company
 for
 baby


books
 he
 sold
 it
 but
 he


>> he
 said
 look
 I
 think
 this
 is
 something


so
 he
 wrote
 a
 $17,000
 check
 on
 our
 air
 m


>> thousands
 yeah
 and
 for
 us
 17,000
 was


life


>> versus
 debt


>> we
 came
 from
 600
 bucks
 and
 few
 hundred


bucks
 and
 so
 then
 he
 brought
 two
 other


phoning


actually
 was
 16,000
 16,000
 16,000
 we
 got


15,000.
 The
 problem
 with
 15,000
 divided


3
 was
 6666.
 There
 was
 too
 many
 sixes


like
 we
 don't
 we
 don't
 want
 too
 many
 six


in
 the
 captive.
 So
 we
 we
 round
 it
 up
 17


17
 and
 we
 got
 51,000
 check.
 Now
 the


funny
 the
 second
 funny
 part
 is
 we


negotiated
 and
 closed
 the
 deal
 at
 Travis


Kalani
 house.


>> Travis
 Kalanic's
 house.
 I
 remember
 there


was
 an
 article
 about
 you
 sleeping
 on
 his


couch.


>> Yes.
 And
 Airbnb
 guys
 as
 well.
 But
 what


happened
 during
 the
 negotiation
 with


these
 guys
 were
 negotiating
 and
 they


didn't
 want.
 So
 Trevy's
 had
 at
 that
 time


was
 this
 house
 up
 in
 Castro
 called
 it
 a


jampad
 where
 everybody
 would
 go.
 Aaron


leave
 would
 go
 and
 uh
 Drew
 from
 Da
 was


the
 all
 going
 there
 on
 the
 weekends
 and


I
 didn't
 have
 a
 place
 to
 stay.
 So


actually
 Travis
 give
 me
 his
 place
 to


stay
 a
 few
 a
 few
 weeks
 as
 long
 as
 I


would
 cook
 carbonara
 for
 his
 better
 half


once
 a
 week.
 And
 I
 did
 that
 and
 then
 and


then
 we
 needed
 help.
 He
 said
 come
 to
 my


kitchen.
 We
 negotiate.
 So
 we
 sit
 on
 the


table.
 It
 was
 myself
 and
 Travis
 Kalanic


and
 they
 were
 the
 three
 YouTube


investors
 negotiated
 this
 convertible


notes
 are
 like
 50%
 discount
 something


crazy.
 were
 desperate
 and
 so
 I
 say
 okay


well
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 this
 deal
 like


you
 know
 screw
 that
 I
 say
 okay
 okay


we're
 going
 to
 leave
 I
 say
 and
 I
 was


very
 naive
 20
 years
 old
 okay
 okay
 will


come
 back
 and
 Travis
 come
 to
 me
 put
 the


hands
 and
 say
 if
 this
 guy
 leave
 you're


never
 going
 to
 see
 them
 again
 and
 nor


the
 money


>> wow


>> so
 let
 me
 do
 something
 else


>> so
 you
 guys
 stay
 here
 and
 figure
 it
 out


the
 the
 cont
 offer
 and
 I
 go
 to
 the


bathroom
 we
 close
 his
 s
 and
 we
 come
 back


in
 10
 minutes
 so
 brought
 me
 to
 the


bathroom
 lock
 the
 door
 of
 the
 house
 so


these
 guys
 don't


went
 to
 the
 bathroom
 and
 we
 said
 there


10
 minutes
 go
 back
 another
 round
 of


negotiation
 back
 to
 the
 bathroom
 so


three
 four
 time
 at
 the
 end
 we
 handshake


on
 the
 deal
 just
 finally
 better
 like
 42%


convertible
 kind
 instead
 of
 50


>> and
 no
 and
 it
 was
 a
 higher
 cap


>> and
 that's
 it
 and
 then
 we
 shake
 the
 hand


and
 and
 that
 was
 it


>> that's
 crazy
 so
 I
 I
 remember
 you
 had
 the


um


you
 had
 the
 Quora
 like
 the
 top
 Kora
 post


for
 living
 on
 like
 13,000
 a
 year
 in
 San


Francisco.


>> You
 had
 raised
 51,000


>> and
 now
 you
 had
 to
 make
 that
 last
 as


long
 as
 possible.
 So
 maybe
 talk
 about


the
 the
 next


>> Yeah.


>> stretch.


>> What
 happened
 is
 obviously
 we
 got
 we
 got


to
 go
 back.
 We
 are
 illegal
 in
 two
 weeks.


So
 we
 went
 back
 to
 Italy
 um
 and
 we
 we we


we
 came
 back
 with
 a
 B1
 which
 you
 could


be
 there.
 We
 can
 be
 here
 6
 months.


But
 how?
 We
 have
 no
 social
 security


number.
 We
 have
 no
 credit
 score.
 Nobody.


So
 you
 have
 into
 this
 American
 system


very
 different
 than
 Italy
 system.
 You


you you
 have
 to
 enter
 into
 a
 new
 system


and
 we
 had
 zero
 anything.
 So
 we
 couldn't


pay
 our
 salary
 cuz
 we
 didn't
 have
 SSN.


We
 didn't
 have
 a
 legal
 visa
 to
 pay


oursel
 all
 that.
 So
 the
 company


>> Did
 you
 have
 employees
 at
 this
 point?


>> No,
 it
 was
 just
 you
 two.


>> It
 was
 three
 of
 us.
 It
 was
 Mikuela
 was


the
 Turk
 co-founder
 back
 then.
 But
 um
 we


did
 a,000
 and
 about
 1,900
 monthly


promisory
 note
 that
 the
 company
 would


give
 us
 and
 we
 would
 have
 to
 live
 in


three
 with
 $1,000
 a
 month.


>> That
 would
 be


>> So
 you
 you
 were
 living
 off
 of
 $1,000
 a


month.


>> In
 three


people
 were
 living
 off
 $1,000.


>> Yeah.
 For


>> in
 San
 Francisco.
 How
 do
 you
 do
 that?


>> It
 was
 cheaper.


>> Now
 what
 year
 was
 this?


>> Uh
 2009
 2010.


>> Even
 then.
 2010.
 Even
 then
 it's


impossible.
 $1,000
 a
 month
 for
 three


people.
 I
 tell
 you
 how
 we
 did
 it.
 So,
 we


live
 it
 in
 uh
 on
 Airbnb
 somewhere
 else


at
 like
 100
 bucks


>> and
 all
 in
 the
 same
 mattress.


>> Um
 Wow.


>> And
 uh
 we
 were
 going
 to
 Valencia.
 I


don't know
 if
 you
 in
 Valencia.


>> Did
 you
 have
 an
 office?


>> No,
 we
 were
 working
 out
 of
 Starbucks


and
 we
 were
 living
 in
 Valencia
 and
 we


were
 buying
 rice,
 beans,
 and
 tuna
 and


pasta.
 And
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 we
 had
 to


find
 the
 right
 amount
 of
 carbs
 and


product
 at
 the
 cheapest
 way
 possible.


And
 that
 was
 the
 combination
 of
 I
 guess


amount
 of
 carbs
 and
 product
 at
 the


cheapest
 way
 possible.
 And
 that's
 how
 we


made
 it.
 Like
 we
 we
 never
 eat
 out.
 We


never
 buy.
 We
 did
 everything
 in
 the


house.
 We
 cooked
 in
 the
 in
 the
 kitchen


Airbnb.
 Rice,
 beans
 or
 tuna
 pasta.
 In


fact,
 we
 eat
 so
 much
 tuna
 pasta
 with


tomato
 that
 Mark
 and
 I
 when
 we
 seen
 tuna


pasta,
 we
 almost
 threw
 up
 because
 we


just
 running
 on
 tuna
 pasta
 every
 single


day.
 So
 how
 wait
 so
 how
 how
 long
 did


this


>> last?


>> That
 last
 uh
 so
 March
 April
 2010
 a
 year


a
 year
 and
 a
 few
 months.


>> Wow.
 And
 what
 were
 you
 doing
 this
 time?


I
 can
 I
 know
 what
 Marco
 was
 doing
 this


time.
 He
 was
 writing
 code.
 What
 were
 you


doing?
 I
 was
 writing
 blog,
 building
 the


website,
 calling
 uh
 pro
 the
 sign
 up,


talking
 with
 all
 every
 sign
 up
 on
 the


website
 that
 was
 talking
 to
 us
 and


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 I
 was
 mix
 of
 b


devs,
 HTML,
 CSS,
 slicer,
 um
 talking
 with


investor
 too
 as
 you
 start
 to
 build
 the


seed
 rounds.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 trying
 to
 do
 some
 recruiting
 that


never
 worked
 because
 nobody
 wanted
 to


work
 for
 illegal
 Italians
 that
 will


disappears.


So
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 mistakes
 and
 this


Yeah.
 few
 things.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 So
 take
 us
 to
 the
 seed
 round.


So
 somebody
 decided
 to
 give
 you
 a
 proper


round
 at
 some
 point.


>> So
 then
 a
 year
 later
 we
 we we


rearchitect.
 So
 we
 went
 we
 went
 to


Honolulu
 on
 the
 beach
 and
 Moana
 beach


and
 we
 we
 thought
 about
 okay
 all
 these


APIs
 were
 aggregating.
 I
 think
 the
 word


is
 actually
 actually
 we
 see
 now
 finally


now
 but
 10
 10
 15
 years
 ago
 it
 wasn't


ready.
 they
 were
 to
 like
 build
 apps
 on


the
 fly
 through
 APIs
 with
 drag
 and
 drop.


We
 wen't
 we
 were
 too
 far
 ahead.
 We're


missing
 pieces
 but
 say
 hey
 we're
 we
 are


wrapping
 a
 lot
 of
 APIs
 actually
 that


assembly
 line
 visual
 still
 hold.
 We
 just


have
 to
 pivot
 it
 and
 build
 an
 API


marketplace
 where
 all
 the
 APIs
 producer


and
 consumers
 they
 can
 come
 together


>> and
 so
 we
 pivot
 that
 we
 relaunch
 it
 uh


with
 you
 know
 tank
 crunch
 all
 the
 stuff.


>> Okay.
 So
 so
 originally
 we're
 doing
 this


kind
 of
 drag
 and
 drop
 composable


>> app
 builder


>> apps
 builder
 thing.
 So
 funny
 how
 many


companies
 go
 through
 this
 like
 exact


journey
 and
 then
 you're
 like
 okay


>> with
 HTML
 5.


>> Wow.
 And
 then
 you're
 like
 okay
 no
 we


need
 to
 build
 a
 marketplace.


>> Exactly.
 Cuz
 okay
 the
 economy
 this
 API


economy
 will
 come.
 It's
 not
 just
 apps.


It
 will
 be
 APIs
 and
 we
 build
 a


marketplace.
 We
 launch
 it.
 We
 got
 little


disentractions
 on
 longtail
 and
 that
 was


already
 the
 summer
 of
 2011.


>> Yeah.


>> After
 pivot
 in
 Hawaiian.
 So
 we
 launched


very
 fast.
 Boom
 boom
 boom.
 And
 um
 and


then
 we
 raised
 after


>> was
 the
 was
 the
 Hawaiian
 on
 the
 last
 of


the
 money
 from


>> No
 because
 San
 Francisco
 Tonolulu
 I


think
 at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 like
 300


bucks.
 So
 we
 say
 with
 our
 51k
 we
 would


we
 we
 we
 were
 living
 like
 on
 tuna
 pasta


rice
 and
 beans
 in
 Valencia
 in
 mission
 in


this
 in
 this
 historic
 building
 middle
 of


nowhere
 and
 working
 mattress
 and
 things.


It's
 like


>> unbelievable.


>> At
 some
 point
 I
 remember
 I
 remember
 woke


up
 in
 the
 morning
 I
 got
 to
 go
 I
 need
 I


need
 to
 go
 to
 Honolulu.
 We
 could
 do
 our


walk
 on
 the
 beach
 and
 thinking
 about
 our


future
 or
 no
 future
 because
 we
 knew
 this


was
 going
 no
 future.
 our
 money
 were


starting
 to
 drain
 and
 we
 needed
 to
 pivot


and
 that's
 where
 we
 had
 the
 idea
 let's


go
 for
 the
 pivot
 and
 then
 we
 come
 back


we
 we
 did
 the
 crazy
 I
 I
 remember
 was


building
 the
 website
 market
 was
 going


crazy
 the
 third
 co-ounder
 was
 building


all
 the
 Java
 back
 ends
 and
 the
 launch


fast
 and
 then
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 tech


crunch
 press
 at
 that
 time
 was
 read
 write


web


>> this
 other
 was
 mashable


>> and
 so
 all
 that
 somehow
 we
 got
 covered


by
 all
 of
 that
 which
 now
 like
 crazy
 and


then
 um
 and
 boom
 and
 then
 we
 raised
 um


and
 then
 it
 started
 seed
 round
 uh
 uh


phase


>> from
 who?
 So
 at
 that
 time


uh
 we
 went
 through
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of


iterations
 but
 where
 we
 ended
 up
 was
 NEA


leading
 the
 seed
 round
 and
 then
 Index


co-leading
 20A
 and
 then
 we
 and
 then
 we


got
 a
 bunch
 and
 then


>> in
 the
 se
 so
 Vulpi
 did
 the


>> yeah
 so
 what
 happened
 is
 actually
 the


first
 checks
 were
 George
 Zakari
 from
 CRV


back
 then
 he
 didn't
 like
 lead
 the
 round


but
 he
 wrote
 he
 was
 the
 first
 100k


commit
 so
 with
 that
 he
 say
 we
 have
 CRV


100k
 at
 that
 point
 had
 a
 seed
 program


very
 unusual
 back
 And
 then
 we
 went
 28


and
 he
 said
 we're
 going to
 lead
 this


round.
 At
 that
 point
 also
 they
 start
 a


seat
 program
 500k
 and
 then
 we
 went


through
 and
 then
 and
 then
 I
 met
 Mike


Vulpi
 that
 just
 moved
 to
 San
 Francisco


to
 launch
 index
 US.
 It
 was
 like
 him
 and


Denny
 Rhymer
 through
 there
 somewhere.
 I


said
 and
 they
 also
 started
 out
 angel
 a


seed
 program
 and
 they
 they
 wrote
 another


big
 checks
 and
 then
 we
 got
 a
 long
 tail


which
 was
 likely
 Jeff
 Bezos
 and
 Eddie


Schmidt
 into
 the
 funds
 and
 so
 we
 got


this
 this
 combination


>> basos
 and
 Eric
 Schmidt.
 So
 again
 that
 is


said
 in
 DPD
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 we
 can't


replicate.
 So
 what
 happened
 is


Jeff
 Bezos
 so
 Jeff
 Bezos
 I
 knew
 he
 was


special
 about
 marketplace
 as
 a
 business


APIs
 and
 developers.
 AWS
 was
 just


starting
 to
 take
 off.
 It
 was
 this
 hidden


secret.
 So


>> is
 it
 2011?


>> Yeah.
 So
 Amazon
 was
 maybe
 a
 $50
 billion


company
 then
 $80
 billion
 company.


Um
 so
 what
 happened
 is
 uh
 I
 I I
 I
 hire


the
 lawyer
 of
 his
 family
 office
 for
 call


for
 me
 shape
 and
 after
 we
 hired
 for


doing
 the
 seed
 round
 as
 the
 seed
 round


was
 going
 along
 I
 say
 by
 the
 way
 since


you
 are
 also
 the
 the
 lawyer
 of
 the


family
 office
 and
 basos
 expeditions
 can


you
 introduce
 me
 can
 introduce
 me
 to


Jeff
 Basos
 that's
 what
 we
 do
 so
 it's
 a


PG
 cool
 call
 and
 then
 he
 was
 on
 the
 road


with
 his
 brother
 going
 around
 with
 his


brother
 on
 the
 road
 in
 Texas
 and
 uh
 you


he
 actually
 want
 to
 put
 more
 and
 invest.


Boom.
 So
 that
 was
 Jeff
 Bezos.
 What
 do


you
 get
 from
 Jeff
 Bz?
 You
 get
 the
 brand.


So
 we
 got
 a
 dinners
 a
 year
 strategy
 of


things


but
 obviously
 was
 the
 big
 brand.
 And


then
 second,
 uh,
 Eric
 Schmidt,
 we
 were


working
 this
 co-working
 space.
 And
 what


happened
 is
 we
 were
 the
 only
 startup


that
 stay
 the
 latest
 in
 the
 night
 after


this
 other
 startup
 that
 was
 doing


Expedia
 for
 cruise
 ships
 that
 just


raised
 from
 NEA
 and
 Eric
 Schmidt.
 And
 at


the
 end,
 they
 saw
 us
 working
 till
 3:00


a.m.,
 4:00
 a.m.
 They
 would
 leave
 a
 chew


when
 they
 knew
 we're
 fundraising.
 And


this
 and
 the
 investor
 asked,
 "Who's
 the


hardest
 worker
 than
 you?"
 And
 say,
 "This


guy's
 next
 to
 us."
 And
 so
 they


introduced
 us
 to
 the
 Eric
 Schmidt
 fund.


And
 that's
 how
 Edish
 Mid
 invest.


>> Wow.


>> Totally
 unrelated.


>> All
 right.
 So
 now
 this
 brings
 us
 to
 201.


>> So
 what
 was
 your
 total?
 What
 was
 the


total
 seed
 funding
 you
 raised


>> at
 that
 time?
 It
 was
 very
 big.
 Uh
 it
 was


1.5.


>> It's
 like
 wow
 huge
 seed
 round.


>> I
 got
 to
 say
 in
 2010
 11.


>> I
 got
 to
 say
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 optimism.


It's
 an
 optimistic
 retrospective
 view
 to


be
 like
 there
 was
 three
 of
 you
 on
 a


mattress
 for
 a
 year
 and
 then
 you
 say
 you


were
 lucky


>> illegally.


>> That
 sounds
 pretty
 unlucky.


>> Illegally.
 wrong
 to
 jail.


>> All right.
 So
 now
 you
 have
 your
 seat


fund
 match
 shapes
 going.


>> So
 then
 we
 raise
 the
 seat.
 Uh
 all
 right.


Now
 it's
 real.
 We
 got
 to
 get
 these


visas.
 We
 got
 a
 middle.
 So
 we
 went
 back


to
 Italy,
 go
 to
 the
 American
 embassy,


blah
 blah
 blah.
 Do
 the
 letter
 of


recommendations.
 Actually
 Sam
 Alman
 was


one
 of
 the
 guys
 that
 wrote
 me
 a
 letter


recommendation
 when
 he
 was
 um
 CEO
 of


Looped.


>> No
 kidding.
 which
 I
 met
 on.
 We
 were


going
 to
 the
 NEA
 retreat
 and
 I
 see
 next


to
 him
 in
 the
 bus
 and
 we
 went
 to
 Pebble


Beach
 to
 the
 NA
 retreat
 and
 we
 spent


three
 hours
 together
 and
 I
 said,
 "By
 the


way,
 I'm
 in
 illegal
 here.
 Can
 you
 write


me
 a
 letter
 of
 recommendation
 for
 my
 01


visa?"
 No
 kidding.
 And
 he
 wrote
 me.
 So
 I


have
 this
 big
 thing
 of
 how
 great
 I
 am.


That's
 great.
 I
 got
 a
 recommendation.


You
 got
 to
 get
 this
 guy
 in
 the
 country


no
 matter
 what.


>> So
 we
 got
 this
 five
 letters
 and
 and
 I


get
 this
 01
 visa
 and
 finally
 I
 got
 the


visa.
 So
 finally
 I
 can
 come
 here.
 can


get
 a
 wei
 work
 space
 and
 we
 start
 to


hire
 and
 we
 had
 seven
 people
 and
 Mark


also
 get
 the
 visa.
 Mark
 is
 also
 because


of
 the
 love
 book
 he
 never
 got
 uh
 to


college
 or
 nothing.
 So
 it
 was
 the


hardest
 visa
 to
 do.
 So
 we
 we
 figured
 it


out
 more
 letter
 recommendations
 for
 him.


We
 brought
 him
 there
 we
 stay
 here
 blah


blah
 blah
 we
 build
 a
 year
 we
 grow
 but


you
 know
 at
 that
 time
 like
 you
 needed


like
 a
 million
 let's
 say
 a
 million


revenue
 to
 to
 take
 a
 a
 good
 ser
 for
 a


marketplace
 you
 need
 a
 million
 in
 gross


volume.
 we
 were
 like
 at
 50k
 so
 lot
 of


traction
 but
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 revenue.
 Um


but
 we
 went
 through


a
 3
 four
 month
 series
 A
 race
 and
 um
 and


CRV


uh
 led
 and
 then
 index
 was
 it
 devot
 that


>> yeah
 that


>> yeah
 yeah
 because
 George
 Zachary
 was


more
 a
 consumer
 so
 he
 passed
 the
 the


thing
 to
 death
 just
 more
 on
 the


enterprise
 side
 I
 remember
 deva
 told
 me


like


Sunday
 at
 6:00
 a.m.
 to
 go
 for
 a
 walk
 uh


to
 decided
 to
 invest
 or
 not
 and
 he
 knows


I'm
 a
 night
 hole
 and
 and
 he
 just
 Sunday


6
 a.m.
 to
 go
 to
 go
 down
 to
 Palo
 Alto


which
 I
 had
 I
 had
 to
 rent
 a
 zip
 car


where
 the
 zip
 cars
 there
 was
 no
 Uber
 and


uh
 and
 go
 down
 there
 and


>> and
 uh
 and
 then
 go
 for
 a
 few
 walks
 and
 I


decided
 to
 to
 invest
 because
 he
 was
 he


was
 always
 actually
 a
 big
 believer
 on


APIs
 as
 assembly
 line
 he
 could
 see
 that


>> maybe
 wasn't
 sure
 marketplace
 was
 the


right
 execution
 but
 the
 theme
 he
 was
 a


big
 believer
 and
 I
 think
 he
 like
 us
 like


he
 came
 to
 see
 us
 sleep
 in
 the
 same


mattress
 he
 wanted
 to
 really
 see
 that


we're
 not
 like
 bullshitting
 the
 big


drama
 story
 it
 was
 really
 drama
 actually


he
 opens
 he
 came
 to
 the
 aer
 house
 cuz
 we


moved
 to
 a
 house
 in
 South
 Park
 at
 that


time
 where
 we're
 sleeping
 and
 working


there
 with
 the
 70p
 and
 he
 opens
 a
 closet


and
 there's
 like
 all
 the
 bananas
 felling


off
 because
 it
 was
 one
 guy's
 only
 eating


huge
 bananas.
 You
 open
 another
 closet
 is


another
 mattress
 with
 other
 guys


sleeping
 a
 second
 closet.
 Okay,
 this


this
 is
 real.


>> Wow.


How
 big
 was
 your
 a


>> 6
 uh
 6.5
 million?


>> Oh,
 so
 for
 you
 that
 must
 be
 must
 have


been
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


>> 6.5
 million.
 Yeah.
 I
 went
 out
 with
 this


power.
 Let's
 raise
 a
 10
 million
 serious


at
 that
 point.
 That
 was
 like
 the
 big


thing.
 We
 ended
 up
 at
 6.5
 and
 uh


I
 say
 that's
 it
 was
 like
 when
 we
 saw
 it


was
 like
 yeah
 like
 maybe
 we
 got
 a
 shot.


>> So
 at
 some
 at
 some
 point
 you
 decided


that
 the
 market
 wasn't
 working.


>> The
 market
 wasn't
 working.
 And
 um
 I


think
 so
 we
 raised
 this
 and
 we
 ra
 we


hire
 more.
 We
 moved
 20
 off
 25
 people


like
 you
 the
 usual
 post
 race
 uh


honeymoon.


Um
 and
 I
 remember
 this
 thing
 like
 6


months
 after
 uh
 we
 the
 business
 wasn't


really
 doing
 anything.
 So
 it
 was
 one


board
 meeting
 that
 we
 just
 cook
 pasta


for
 the
 board
 members
 at
 that
 time


because
 that
 was
 like
 two
 years
 before


you
 joined
 us
 and
 it
 was
 there
 was


nothing
 to
 talk
 about
 from
 business.


>> The
 issue
 was
 is
 you
 couldn't
 monetize


or
 there
 was
 a
 graduation
 problem
 like


these
 marketplaces
 are
 very
 tough.
 So


the
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 market
 when
 I
 was


staying
 with
 Airbnb
 founders
 I
 learned


that
 the
 marketplace
 are
 could
 be
 the


biggest
 more
 powerful
 business
 in
 the


world
 like
 you
 don't
 even
 have
 to


innovate
 once
 you
 get
 liquidity
 it's


just
 you
 can
 disrupt
 it
 look
 at
 eBay
 you


eBay
 you
 can't
 kill


>> so
 I
 thought
 like
 there's
 all
 this
 API


you
 can
 build
 a
 marketplace
 liquidity


it'll
 be
 like
 the
 w
 the
 ws
 of
 and
 so
 we


we
 noticed
 though
 that
 in
 our
 case
 it


was
 a
 developer
 API
 marketplace
 so
 to


have
 a
 marketplace
 to
 work
 you
 need
 to


have
 a
 long
 tale
 of
 low
 power
 people.
 If


you
 have
 concentrated
 in
 a
 few
 high


power
 marketplace
 doesn't
 work
 like


Airbnb
 houses
 like
 millions
 of
 people


with
 low
 power.
 So
 that
 was
 one
 true
 you


need
 to
 have
 exclusivity
 somewhat
 like


the
 door
 to
 access
 that
 that
 marketplace


supply
 has
 to
 be
 through
 the


marketplace.
 APIs
 you
 could
 Google
 and


go
 to
 the
 website
 you
 wouldn't
 go


through
 go
 through
 the
 marketplace.
 APIs


at
 that
 time
 power
 of
 low
 for
 public


APIs
 was
 on
 the
 tweet
 or
 the
 stride.


There
 were
 30
 that
 matters
 and
 3,000


that
 didn't
 matter
 much.
 So
 it
 was
 also


this
 longtail
 power
 and
 third
 thing
 is


was
 quality
 like
 you
 couldn't
 you
 were


running
 a
 cloud
 marketplace
 you
 couldn't


actually
 maintain
 the
 quality
 of
 the


supply
 you
 were
 always
 get
 blamed
 for
 it


and
 there
 was
 no
 trust
 and
 and
 so
 I


think
 because
 of
 that
 it
 got
 to
 a


million
 and
 a
 half
 in
 gross
 revenue
 but


it
 never
 became
 this
 Airbnb
 or
 Uber
 API


>> that
 is
 like
 10%
 yeah
 it
 was
 it
 was
 also


losing
 margin
 on
 AWS
 so
 they
 I
 could


never
 make
 the
 economics
 in
 that
 model
 I


could
 never
 make
 the
 economics
 works


even
 if
 this
 thing
 would
 have
 scaled
 so


Then
 we
 go
 there.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 this


is
 we're
 here
 year
 we're
 burning.
 We're


running
 out
 of
 money.
 And
 so
 we
 built


this
 massive
 API
 engine
 behind
 the


marketplace
 API
 gateway
 that
 was


powering
 20,000
 APIs
 of
 this
 longtail


doing
 billing,
 rate
 limiting,
 routing,


caching,
 authentication,
 authorization,


logging,
 all
 of
 that.
 We
 built
 it
 three


times
 and
 the
 third
 time
 was
 the
 great


one.
 And
 we
 say,
 wait
 a
 second,
 every


company
 will
 become
 an
 API
 company.
 Why


we
 don't
 take
 this
 this
 engine
 and
 we


give
 it
 to
 the
 whole
 world?
 And
 that
 was


the
 beginning
 of
 open
 source,
 And


so
 boom,
 we
 we
 open
 source
 uh
 Kong.


>> What
 was
 your
 what
 was
 your
 runway
 at


the
 time
 that
 you
 open
 sourced
 Kong?


>> Uh
 so
 we
 open
 source
 in
 April
 15.
 We
 had


to
 take
 a
 bridge
 of
 uh
 2
 million
 to
 go


another
 year
 because


>> was
 it
 an
 insider
 bridge?


>> Yeah,
 we
 we
 had
 to
 take
 an
 an
 extensions


because
 we
 were
 out
 of
 gas


>> from
 from
 Dev
 and
 Mike.


>> Yeah,
 they
 give
 us
 an
 extension
 on
 the
 2


millions
 because
 we
 were
 out
 of
 gas.


like
 we
 were
 would
 have
 died
 otherwise.


>> Wow.
 So
 you
 you
 released
 I
 remember
 when


Kong
 released
 it
 was
 actually
 a
 really


big
 deal.
 When
 was
 that?
 2015


>> 15.


>> Yes.


>> Big
 deal.
 I
 remember
 took
 off.


>> Boom.


>> Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 when
 you
 and
 I
 started


talking
 about
 your
 raise.
 You're
 raising


the


>> you
 came
 at
 the
 right
 times
 before
 like


these
 guys
 make
 no
 sense.
 Okay.
 Now
 it


start
 to
 make
 sense.


Well,
 that
 was
 even
 a
 tough
 race
 for
 you


just
 cuz
 the
 company
 had
 been
 around
 for


seven
 years
 like
 a
 marketplace
 like
 Kong


had
 just
 come
 out
 and
 it
 was
 taking
 off


but
 like
 it
 only
 been
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks


maybe
 a
 couple
 of
 months
 and
 so
 honestly


I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 what
 did
 it
 for
 me
 is


um
 you
 know
 we
 were
 doing
 all
 the
 work


and
 like
 the
 GitHub
 stars
 checked
 out


your
 story
 is
 phenomenal
 your
 command
 of


the
 business
 is
 great
 but
 it
 just
 wasn't


enough
 but
 then
 While
 we
 were
 doing
 the


diligence,
 like
 I
 kept
 getting
 these


kind
 of
 serendipitous
 like
 somebody
 had


used
 Kong
 and
 loved
 it.
 I
 remember


didn't
 like
 somebody
 stay
 in
 like
 your


Airbnb
 and
 like
 loved
 Kong
 and
 like
 and


then
 you
 forwarded
 that
 to
 me
 and
 so


there
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 all
 of
 this,


>> you
 know,
 zeitgeist
 around
 Kong.
 And
 as


a
 result
 of
 that,
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


clearly
 a
 phenomenon."


>> Yeah.
 I
 remember
 I
 was
 spamming
 you
 with


emails
 of
 every
 prospect
 or
 customer


user
 they
 were
 saying
 just
 you
 saying


Kong
 Kong
 usage
 Kong
 usage
 just
 nonstop


like
 it
 was
 blowing
 up
 the
 inbox.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 how
 close
 how
 close


were
 we
 to
 running
 out
 of
 money
 for
 it


to
 be?


>> Uh
 so
 after
 bridge
 there
 were


[Music]


weeks.


>> Jeez.


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 was
 very


>> Nothing
 Nothing
 is
 ever
 gonna
 stress
 you


again
 your
 entire
 life
 because
 you've


been
 so
 close
 to
 at least
 business
 so


many
 times
 because
 I
 actually
 remember


>> when
 we
 went
 to
 the
 office
 it
 felt
 dead.


It
 felt
 like
 basically


>> No,
 no,
 we
 were
 dead
 and
 we
 just
 didn't


know
 about
 it.


>> You
 were
 like
 two
 weeks
 from
 being
 dead.


I
 mean
 it
 felt


>> we
 were
 like
 bang
 you
 know that
 it
 flies


but
 it's
 not
 supposed
 to
 fly
 and
 we
 keep


going.


>> No,
 I
 remember
 that
 very
 very
 well.


>> Yeah.
 You
 you
 were
 like
 you're
 like
 this


guy's
 been
 there
 a
 while.
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 whatever


they
 raise
 money
 and
 then
 they're
 going


to
 give
 up.
 You
 work
 I
 said
 I
 say
 and
 it


was
 tough.
 Uh
 and
 I
 think
 I
 think
 if
 if


we
 go
 back
 I
 say
 I
 don't
 know
 we
 were


able
 to
 replicate
 all
 the
 sequence
 that


happens
 all
 all
 the
 things
 that
 happens


and
 I
 remember
 we
 went
 uh
 yeah
 and
 then


uh
 then
 we
 had
 that
 that
 great
 sushi


with
 with
 Mark
 Andre
 and
 you
 and
 I
 and


we
 sealed
 the
 deal
 and
 Marco.


>> Yeah.
 The
 end
 of
 2016
 we
 closed
 and


since
 then
 the
 company's
 just
 been


remarkable.
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 kind
 of
 an


announcement
 recently
 that
 across
 100


million
 which
 is
 now
 actually
 quite
 a


while
 back.


>> A
 year
 and a
 half
 ago.
 Yeah.


>> A
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago.
 So


>> we
 we


>> Yeah.
 It
 was
 in
 in
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 is


10
 years
 where
 we
 were
 like
 when
 you


invested
 we
 were
 AR
 less
 than
 a
 million.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Less
 than
 a
 million
 of
 do
 not
 even
 a


million
 500k
 probably.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 once
 I
 remember?
 So


yeah.
 So
 you
 had
 a
 great
 first
 year
 and


then
 I
 told
 you
 I
 said
 listen
 if
 you


if
 if
 you
 hit
 10
 million
 or
 whatever
 it


was
 I'll
 buy
 you
 a
 car.
 remember
 that


>> I
 did.
 Oh,
 actually
 I
 we
 have
 in
 the
 new


office
 now.
 I
 need
 to
 send
 you
 a


picture.


>> Well,
 there's
 a
 funny
 story
 about
 this


and
 so
 like
 you
 know
 you
 um
 you
 do
 it.


So
 like
 I
 think
 you
 grow
 like


>> 10x
 that
 year.


>> So
 that
 year
 we
 went
 from
 2
 million
 of


RR


>> Yeah.


>> to
 10.


>> That
 was
 right.


>> The
 planning
 was
 six
 or
 seven.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 I


went
 I
 went
 I
 checked
 with
 compliance


and
 I'm
 like
 can
 I
 buy
 Auggie
 a
 cheap


car
 and
 they
 said
 the
 maximum
 for
 a
 gift


is
 whatever
 it
 is.
 doesn't
 sound
 like


crap.
 So,
 so
 I
 ended
 up
 buying
 you
 the


best
 model
 car
 I
 could
 find


>> from
 Japan,
 I
 think.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 spent
 a
 long
 time


actually
 looking
 for
 this
 model
 car.


>> Is
 the
 280
 GT?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 that's
 right.


>> So,
 great.
 So,
 so
 I
 would
 love
 to
 shift


I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 most
 remarkable


Silicon
 Valley
 startup
 story
 that
 I
 know


of
 that
 I'm
 close
 to
 and
 I
 kind
 of


having


>> They
 will
 make
 a
 movie
 one
 day.


>> They
 will
 have
 to
 make
 a
 movie
 one
 day.


Yeah.
 Um
 I
 would
 love
 to
 like
 kind
 of


shift
 towards
 how
 you
 think
 about


product,
 how
 you
 think
 about
 markets
 and


then
 kind
 of
 move
 towards
 AI.
 So
 you


actually
 have
 seen
 a
 number
 of
 shifts


now,
 right?
 You've
 saw
 the
 cloud
 come,


you've
 saw
 the
 shift
 to
 APIs.


So
 maybe
 just
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


how
 you
 view
 this
 current
 shift
 with
 AI.


Is
 it
 is
 it
 fundamentally
 different?
 Is


the
 same?
 Does
 it
 change
 how
 you
 think


about
 yourself
 as
 a
 leader?
 Like


how
 h
 how
 is
 your
 view
 at
 a
 high
 level?


So
 the
 the
 the
 big
 thing
 is
 I
 I'll
 start


with
 API
 first.
 So
 obviously
 we
 we
 we


built
 we
 become
 this
 API
 infrastructure


company.


>> Yeah.
 May
 maybe
 we
 should
 just
 describe


what
 Kong
 is
 right
 now
 before
 we


actually
 do
 that.


>> So
 so
 we
 left
 with
 this
 pivot
 and
 we


open
 source
 uh
 Kong
 API
 gateway
 took
 off


and
 we
 become
 an
 enterprise
 company.
 We


became
 we
 rebrand
 Kong
 Inc.
 Uh
 and
 we


start
 to
 build
 all
 sort
 of
 API


infrastructure
 to
 run
 manage
 and
 secure


your
 internal
 or
 external
 APIs.
 So
 you


have
 software,
 you
 have
 microservices,


you
 have
 10,
 100
 thousand
 of
 APIs.
 We're


kind
 of
 this
 highways
 uh
 that
 makes
 them


run
 and
 you
 have
 rate
 limiting.
 Like
 if


if
 APIs
 were
 a
 cars,
 you
 got
 guardrails,


speed
 bump,
 speed
 cameras,
 gas
 stations,


stalls,
 bumps,
 guardrails,
 everything,


ambulance,
 and
 we
 provide
 all
 the


infrastructure
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 API


connectivity
 runs
 for
 small
 company,
 big


company,
 all
 of
 that.


Now
 in
 in
 this
 transition
 you
 mentioned


what
 really
 drove
 I
 think
 this
 explosion


of
 cloud
 APIs
 was
 the
 workload
 moving


from
 onrem
 to
 the
 cloud.
 The
 second


transition
 is
 breaking
 down
 the
 monolith


to
 microser
 creates
 more
 and
 more
 APIs


the
 big
 data
 and
 all
 that
 creates
 event


streaming
 all
 that.
 So
 this
 just
 data
 in


motion
 is
 much
 higher
 than
 is
 becoming


much
 higher
 than
 like
 data
 rest
 or
 data


data
 news
 than
 before.
 But
 but
 but
 in
 a


way
 when
 you
 were
 starting
 the
 company


you
 were
 drafting
 on
 a
 big
 transition


right
 which
 was
 the
 breaking
 down
 of
 the


monolith
 and
 the
 shift
 to
 cloud


>> right
 and


>> that
 was
 the
 key.


>> Yeah


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 before
 there
 were
 all


these
 archive
 legacy
 solutions
 in
 APIs


but
 they
 were
 not
 built
 for
 the


transition
 to
 the
 cloud
 and
 breaking


down
 the
 monolith
 into
 microservices
 and


highcale
 decentralized
 architecture.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 from
 your
 time
 on
 like


we
 we
 we
 kind
 of
 invented
 a
 control


plane
 data
 plane
 separation
 at
 the
 API


management,
 API
 control
 plane
 level.


Nobody
 was
 doing
 it
 before.
 I
 I
 got
 to


say
 I
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 know


or
 maybe
 don't
 appreciate
 how
 fast
 Kong


grew
 when
 it
 actually
 happened.
 So,


there
 was
 seven
 years
 of
 starvation,


right?
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 just
 basically


wasn't
 working.


>> No,
 actually,
 I
 know
 and
 you
 don't
 you


know
 this,
 but
 like
 every
 year
 we
 do
 the


founders
 award.


>> Yeah.
 The
 founders
 award
 is
 2555


stock
 to
 the
 best
 employee
 of
 the


company.


>> Yeah.


>> Why?
 That


>> is
 255
 days
 of
 struggle
 to
 remember


every
 day
 which
 is
 seven
 years.


>> That's
 amazing.


>> It's
 seven
 years.


>> Every
 year
 the
 company
 has
 to
 go
 they


get
 255.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just
 symbolic
 of


course


>> to
 remember
 seven
 years
 of
 struggle.


Every
 year
 is
 a
 retrol.


>> And
 there's
 this
 crazy
 diving
 catch


which
 you
 know
 Marco
 does
 the
 greatest


Kong.
 He
 throws
 it
 out
 on
 the
 market
 and


it
 catches
 off.
 But
 once
 it
 did,
 the


company
 grew
 incredibly
 quickly.
 Um,


>> and
 we
 had
 45
 competitors
 when
 we


started.


>> Oh,
 I
 remember
 that.
 Yeah.


>> Now
 it's
 probably
 30.


>> But
 even
 then,
 at
 the
 time,
 yeah.
 Well,


Kong
 broke
 away
 pretty
 quickly.
 So,
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 in
 in
 recent
 years,
 just


clearly
 been
 the
 leader
 on
 this.
 And


that
 only
 happens,
 I
 think,
 if
 there's


just
 clearly
 a
 market
 need.
 The
 market


also
 kind
 of
 did
 you
 a
 favor
 and
 that


like
 Mulesoft
 got
 acquired
 and
 Apogee


got
 acquired
 too,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 17
 MU
 got
 acquired
 RPG
 got


acquired
 in
 16.


>> That's
 right.
 Yeah.
 So
 like
 in
 in
 a
 way


kind
 of
 like
 the
 there
 was
 consolidation


and
 you
 broke
 out
 as
 this
 leader.
 So
 you


kind
 of
 navigated
 this
 transition
 from


you
 know
 cloud
 to
 breaking
 up
 the


microservices.
 You
 know
 you
 built
 the


control
 plane
 for
 APIs.
 You're


considered
 now
 like
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the


leader
 independent
 for
 sure
 in
 the
 API


space.
 Kong
 is
 the
 leader
 independent.


Um
 there's
 no
 question
 of
 that.
 But
 now


you're
 facing
 another
 market
 shift
 which


is
 kind
 of
 this
 movement
 to
 AI.
 And
 so


do
 you
 view
 this
 as
 directly
 impactful,


adjacent,
 accretive?
 Like
 how
 are
 you
 as


CEO
 viewing
 this?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 again
 is
 it's
 not
 like
 was


like
 any
 me
 those
 things
 but
 the
 market


came
 at
 us
 in
 AI
 by
 creating
 more
 APIs.


What
 that
 means
 agents
 are
 going
 to


consume
 internet
 in
 a
 very
 different
 way


than
 how
 human
 did.
 There's
 not
 any
 more


websites
 scroll
 click
 up
 and
 down


applications.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 there


but
 not
 as
 relevant
 as
 before.
 Agents


are
 going
 to
 programmatically
 exchange


labor
 get
 task
 done
 through
 programming


interface
 whether
 is
 classic
 APRS
 MCP


protocols
 which
 is
 like
 Dualingo
 for


APIs
 makes
 them
 speak
 English
 whatever


it
 is
 the
 protocol
 but
 machines


consuming
 internet
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


different
 than
 human
 consuming
 internet.


Human
 consuming
 internet
 would
 be


through
 UI
 machine
 consuming
 internet
 is


you
 is
 is
 through
 programming
 interface.


That's
 the
 huge
 shift
 that
 we
 we
 are
 now


capturing
 and
 powering
 and
 making
 sure


the
 enterprise


um
 think
 about
 AI
 connectivity
 and
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 behind
 the
 scene
 it's


all
 APIs.
 We
 you
 know
 we
 had
 that
 board


meeting
 what
 was
 it
 yesterday.
 Yes.
 And


what
 you
 know
 what
 I
 found
 actually


pretty
 remarkable
 is
 how
 many
 more
 benal


use
 cases
 there
 are
 around
 AI
 right
 we


can
 talk
 about
 agents
 and
 I
 think
 it's


worth
 talking
 about
 and
 I
 agree
 with
 you


but
 it
 also
 feels
 like
 there's
 like
 a


lot
 of
 just
 basic
 stuff
 like
 like
 key


management
 for
 you
 know
 like
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 are
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 on


these
 AI
 models
 right
 so
 it's
 great
 to


be
 able
 to
 have
 like
 you
 know
 monitoring


billing
 key
 rotations
 all
 of
 that
 stuff


so
 you're
 actually
 seeing
 like
 a


non-agentic
 draft
 now.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 so
 what
 I
 think
 the
 word


is
 a
 bit
 of
 stack.
 Okay.
 You
 have
 these


AI
 companies
 like
 poor
 that
 are
 just


building
 models
 yada
 yada
 and
 then
 then


you
 have
 this
 rapper
 company
 that
 are


trying
 to
 solve
 you
 know
 HR
 issue


whatever
 through
 AI
 then
 you
 have
 these


LLMs
 that
 have
 APIs
 to
 talks
 companies


like
 entropy
 a
 lot
 of
 revenue
 through


APIs
 all
 that
 what
 what
 is
 missing
 is


the
 infrastructure
 to
 make
 those
 those


AI
 talks
 and
 run
 and
 that's
 that's
 what


we
 do
 now
 with
 I
 gate
 a
 lot
 of
 products


but
 at
 the
 core
 the
 boring
 problem
 like


you
 mentioned
 authentication


authorization
 you
 can
 be
 AGI
 as
 much
 as


you
 want
 but
 at
 the
 end
 an
 agent
 gets


stuck
 if
 he
 has
 to
 authenticate
 and
 to


authenticate
 you
 got
 to
 get
 an
 API
 key


you
 need
 a
 human
 in
 the
 loop
 to
 get
 the


API
 key
 authenticate
 but
 if
 you
 can


provide
 infrastructure
 at
 the
 beginning


you
 can
 provision
 and
 auto
 and
 automate


key
 provisioning
 key
 rotation


authentication
 so
 once
 you're
 there
 you


can
 unleash
 your
 LLM
 your
 agents
 to
 just


roam
 free
 without
 getting
 stuck
 every


time
 for
 authentication
 authorization


because
 you're
 already
 provisioning
 all


these
 keys
 I
 think
 that's


That's
 what
 we
 want
 to
 our
 customers.


>> So,
 so
 maybe
 just
 just
 assume
 for
 this


this
 this
 part
 of
 our
 discussion
 that


whoever's
 listening
 is
 is
 pretty


familiar
 with
 AI
 API
 infrastructure,


right?
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 the
 way
 API


infrastructure
 looks
 in
 6
 months
 or
 a


year
 or
 2
 years
 is
 dramatically


different
 because
 of
 AI?
 Or
 is
 it
 that


the
 infrastructure
 that
 we
 have
 in
 place


that
 we
 understand
 today
 evolves


to
 also
 service
 agents
 in
 ways
 that
 are


pretty
 obvious?
 like
 to
 what
 extent
 do


you
 think
 this
 is
 like
 transformational


on
 the
 infrastructure
 layer
 versus
 like


more
 of
 a
 transition?


>> I
 think
 you
 cannot
 do
 AI
 if
 you're
 not


API
 first.


It's
 just
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 mouth
 and


the
 ears
 to
 a
 model.
 Um
 and
 so
 that's


how
 AI
 talks.


So
 the
 way
 we
 know
 about
 API
 API


infrastructure,
 it
 will
 evolve,
 it
 won't


change,
 but
 API
 traffic
 and
 AI
 traffic,


they're
 converging.
 So
 the
 classic
 API


calls
 yes
 but
 also
 when
 you
 move
 tokens


is
 an
 API
 call
 and
 intelligent
 let's
 say


intelligent
 will
 be
 sold
 through
 tokens


every
 earning
 release
 is
 about
 tokens


but
 behind
 and
 each
 tokens
 there
 are


calls
 the
 payloads
 move
 tokens
 so


they're
 kind
 of
 converging
 and
 what
 we


are
 calling
 or
 building
 is
 a
 unified
 API


and
 AI
 connectivity
 platform
 that
 it


helps
 you
 navigate
 this
 transition
 as


you're
 managing
 classic
 API
 traffic
 as


you're
 managing
 agent
 traffic
 as
 you


manage
 MCP
 traffic
 as
 you
 manage
 LLM


traffic
 I
 think
 will
 will
 converge
 into


a
 unified
 like
 program
 and
 that's
 how
 I


think
 intelligence
 will
 move
 and
 it's
 an


evolutionary
 steps
 in
 like
 two
 three


years
 but
 we
 really
 see
 MCP
 traffic


growing
 every
 quarter
 I
 mean
 I
 see
 even


like
 really
 basic
 things
 like
 for


developers
 this
 is
 evolving
 very
 quickly


so
 for
 example
 you
 know
 for
 fun
 I


develop
 using
 cursor


um
 you
 know
 I
 used
 to
 be
 a
 professional


developer
 you
 know
 in
 a
 in
 a
 previous


life
 even
 knowing


what
 API
 guys
 existed
 in
 a
 company


required
 a
 ton
 of
 reading
 through
 docs


or
 some
 weird
 search
 and
 it
 feels
 like


now
 especially
 like
 if
 you
 have


something
 like
 Kong
 which
 you
 know
 has


all
 the
 metadata
 and
 has
 the
 catalog
 and


then
 you
 can
 integrate
 into
 something


like
 cursor
 and
 so
 not
 only
 does
 the


agent
 itself
 know
 about
 the
 APIs
 but
 you


can
 expose
 it
 to
 I
 mean
 it
 feels
 like
 a


lot
 of
 like
 even
 the
 development


paradigm
 is
 shifting
 now
 because
 we
 can


start
 surface
 these
 these
 things
 to


developers.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you


can
 you
 can
 think
 you
 can
 we
 can
 be
 an


enabler
 to
 helps
 large
 companies,
 small


companies
 to
 to
 get
 into
 the
 hands
 of


more
 developers
 or
 more
 courser
 because


it's
 all
 start
 with
 API
 we
 can
 provide


you
 that
 infrastructures
 and
 and
 and
 all


of
 that.
 Uh
 we
 as
 you
 see
 from
 yesterday


we
 have
 a
 a
 very
 exciting
 road
 map
 that


is
 going
 in
 all
 in
 that
 direction.
 Uh
 so


those
 are
 all
 of
 them.
 I
 think
 here


here's
 the
 big
 bet.
 The
 big
 bet
 is


what
 happened
 in
 micro
 because
 I
 grew
 up


in
 Italy
 and
 you
 don't
 really
 study
 a


lot
 of
 math.
 You
 just
 study
 history.
 But


what
 you
 learn
 from
 it
 is
 that
 even
 it


doesn't
 exactly
 repeat
 but
 it
 reads
 it's


just
 there's
 always
 an
 out.
 So
 you
 you


do
 so
 what
 we
 see
 with
 microservices


what
 happened
 we
 we
 first
 build
 ra


limiting
 and
 authentication
 10
 times
 100


times
 50
 times
 into
 the
 python
 framework


the
 javascript
 framework
 the
 typescript


framework
 the
 java
 frame
 whatever
 php


blah
 blah
 blah
 at
 some
 point
 didn't
 make


any
 sense
 let
 let's
 abstract
 everything


to
 a
 gateway
 pattern
 and
 we
 move
 all


this
 connectivity
 logic
 to
 the
 gateway


and
 that
 dispatch
 to
 the
 right
 service


no matter
 what
 language
 the
 same
 thing
 I


think
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 LLMs
 at


first
 you
 have
 one
 enterprise
 use
 one


big
 LMS
 Now
 they're
 going
 to
 use
 five
 10


100
 small
 LM
 medium
 large
 whatever
 once


you
 get
 to
 you
 don't
 do
 tokens


relingiting
 token
 authentication
 in
 each


LLM
 using
 the
 frame
 or
 the
 lchain


whatever
 eventually


same
 thing
 happen
 in
 microser
 you
 will


abstract
 that
 to
 a
 gateway
 partner
 once


again
 and
 that's
 where
 I
 think
 I
 gateway


will
 have
 the
 the
 same
 analogy
 and


dispatcher
 to
 write
 connectivity
 logic


to
 the
 right
 versus
 rewriting


initial
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 big
 bet
 that


we
 make
 that
 happens
 in
 microservices


happens
 in
 how
 enterprise
 will
 run
 and


govern
 hundreds
 of
 LLMs.


>> Great.
 Well,
 listen,
 as
 we
 wrap
 this
 up,


I
 think
 it'd
 be
 great
 to
 kind
 of
 end


with
 like
 any
 sort
 of
 recommendations


for
 people
 that
 are
 listening
 to
 learn
 a


bit
 more
 about
 how
 kind
 of
 AI
 shifting


the
 API
 landscape
 or
 maybe
 you
 know
 some


advice
 on


>> don't
 start
 a
 company.


maybe
 adi
 advice
 on
 kind
 of
 like
 you


know
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 how
 to
 start


thinking
 about
 getting
 ready
 for
 that.
 I


think
 I
 say
 I
 said
 before
 like
 there
 is


a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 model
 pre-training


tuning
 all
 of
 that
 but
 a
 key
 thing
 is


the
 connectivity
 layer
 how
 LLMs
 agents


whatever
 will
 talk
 to
 each
 other
 how
 you


run
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 traffic
 will
 be


very
 strategic
 and
 you
 have
 to
 build
 the


the
 startups
 of
 the
 enterprise
 to
 manage


that
 AI
 connectivity
 into
 your
 next
 apps


your
 next
 internal
 tools
 your
 next


customers


>> and
 for
 the
 uh
 listen
 the
 budding


founders
 that
 are
 listening
 to
 like
 the


most
 hardcore
 Silicon
 Valley


story
 ever.
 What
 advice
 do
 you
 give
 to


them?


>> I
 think
 what
 what
 I
 learned
 over
 a


decade
 of
 like


>> do
 do
 you
 ever
 think
 I
 I
 just
 have
 to
 do


you
 ever
 think
 that
 like
 maybe
 you


should
 have
 cut
 your
 losses
 and
 tried
 to


start
 it
 over
 again?
 Like
 do
 you
 ever


think
 that
 that
 would
 have
 been
 the


right
 thing?


>> Never.


>> No.


>> Never.
 Never.
 The
 the
 reason
 is
 I
 could


never
 visualize
 myself
 going
 back
 to
 the


airport
 in
 Italy
 and
 my
 dad
 picking
 him


up
 and
 say
 how's
 it
 going
 and
 it's
 just


like
 would
 fail
 with
 my
 tails
 and
 my


legs
 like
 I
 could
 never
 I
 would
 have


died
 here
 without
 food
 like
 I
 cannot
 do


that
 and
 so
 that
 that
 never
 crossed


through
 through
 the
 heads


>> shivers
 that
 was
 so
 good


>> but
 never
 like
 that's
 that's
 the
 visual


that
 every
 time
 I
 even
 start
 to
 I
 had


that
 visual
 and
 immediately
 say
 I'm
 not


going
 back
 like
 that


>> and
 so
 and
 then
 But
 the
 thing
 to
 advise


is
 it
 always
 take
 longer
 than
 what
 uh
 we


thinks.
 Um
 it
 it's
 good
 to
 take
 a
 a


trend
 that
 lasts
 10
 years,
 20
 years


because
 you
 have
 time
 to
 grow
 into
 and


do
 a
 lot
 of
 mistakes
 and
 building
 and


just
 you
 have
 to
 generally
 believe
 it
 in


this
 trend
 versus
 falling
 glitters


because
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 longer
 than


what
 you
 think
 as
 a
 leader,
 as
 a
 human,


as
 a
 market,
 as
 a
 product,
 as
 a
 revenue


is
 always
 going
 to
 take
 longer.
 So
 take


something
 that
 last
 and
 just
 put
 110%
 on


it
 every
 day
 and
 then
 it
 will
 compound.


Uh
 keep
 the
 barn
 rate
 low
 in
 the
 early


days.


>> Don't
 die.


>> Don't
 die.
 Like
 don't
 quit.
 Uh
 those


those
 are
 um
 those
 those
 are
 I
 think
 the


things
 I
 learned
 along
 the
 way.


>> AI
 it's
 been
 a
 privilege
 and
 an
 honor


working
 with
 you
 these
 past
 few
 years


and
 thanks
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 the


podcast.


>> Likewise.
 Thank
 you
 Martin.
