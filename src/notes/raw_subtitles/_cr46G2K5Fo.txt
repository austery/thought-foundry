- There is a rule in
mathematics that is so simple,
you would think it obviously must be true,
but if you accept it,
you find there are now some line segments
that have no length.
A sphere without adding anything
to it can be turned into
two identical spheres.
A hundred plus years
of mathematics has been
built on this axiom.
It seems intuitive and it works,
but it also creates ridiculous paradoxes.
So, is it right?
Well, it all starts with
the issue of choice.
Try this, choose a number.
I can just pluck a random
number from my head,
like 37 or 42,
but that is the human brain at work,
not a mathematical process.
In math, you can't truly
pick things at random
because formulas always
give the same result,
which is why computers don't have
true random number generators.
Instead, they usually run an algorithm
on your current local
time to generate numbers
that appear random.
So if we can't pick randomly,
how do we select anything in math?
Well, the only way is to
follow a rule of some sort.
So a rule could be always
choose the smallest thing.
For example, if we're looking
at whole positive integers,
the smallest is one.
For prime numbers it would be two, easy,
but what about the real numbers?
That's any number, positive,
negative, whole, fraction,
even irrational like pi
or the square root of two.
Now try to choose the smallest one.
It's impossible.
The real numbers stretch
off to negative infinity.
Even if we try to fix our rule
by making it super specific,
like choose the smallest number
after one, we still get stuck.
There's 1.01
and then 1.0001,
then 1.00000000001 and so on.
So really what number comes after one?
If we can't begin to specify
the order of the real numbers,
next and previous, first
and last, we're stuck.
The ridiculous part is we
know we have infinite options,
but despite that, we can't
figure out how to just pick one.
The mission to resolve this
began with one man in 1870.
He took on the task
of putting the real numbers
in a definitive order,
even if it killed him and it nearly did.
Georg Cantor was a talented
German mathematician
who found himself at the
center of a firestorm
after publishing one of
his very first papers
at the age of 29.
For centuries, our understanding
of infinity was heavily
influenced by Galileo's 1638 book.
It raised a key question, are
there more natural numbers
or are there more square numbers?
Just looking at them, the square
numbers are more spaced out
and they only become more
sparse the higher you go.
So it would appear there are fewer squares
than natural numbers,
but Galileo realized he
could draw a line matching
every natural number with its own square.
And since he could make
this one-to-one mapping,
that he knew that the two sets
must be exactly the same size.
So there are actually just
as many square numbers
as there are natural numbers.
From this counterintuitive result,
Galileo concluded that terms 
like more than or less than
don't apply to infinity,
how we normally use them.
It's all just one big
concept of foreverness
and this view prevailed for centuries.
In fact, it's how many people
still understand infinity today,
but 200 years on, Cantor wasn't satisfied.
In 1874, he wondered
what if there were two
infinite sets out there
that didn't map perfectly to each other?
Would they be different infinities?
So he set out to compare
the natural numbers
and the real numbers between zero and one.
Cantor started by assuming he
could perfectly map these sets
to each other, one-to-one.
So he imagined writing
down an infinite list
with a natural number on one side
and a real number between
zero and one on the other.
Since there is no smallest real number,
he would just write
them down in any order.
Assuming he now has a
complete infinite list,
Cantor writes down another real number
and to do it, he takes the
first digit of the first number
and adds one, then the second
digit of the second number,
and again, he adds one.
He keeps doing this all
the way down the list.
If the digit is an eight
or a nine, he subtracts
one instead of adding
to avoid duplicates,
and by the end of this
process, he has written down
a real number between zero and one,
but that number doesn't
appear anywhere in his list.
It's different from the first number
in the first decimal place,
different from the second number
in the second decimal place
and so on down the line.
It has to be different from
every number on the list
by at least one digit,
the digit on the diagonal.
That's why this is called
Cantor's Diagonalization Proof
and it shows there must be
more real numbers between zero
and one than there are
natural numbers extending out
to infinity.
Cantor had revealed something remarkable.
Infinity doesn't come in just one size.
Some infinities like the set
of square numbers, integers
or rational numbers
can be paired perfectly
with the natural numbers.
You can literally count them,
one, two, three and so on.
So Cantor called these
countable infinities,
but then there are bigger infinities,
Cantor called them uncountable.
These infinities like the
set of all real numbers,
the complex numbers, they
can't be matched one-to-one
with the natural numbers.
Cantor's results rocked
the mathematical community.
After all, how can something
that continues forever be
bigger than something else
that continues forever?
His work was labeled a
horror and a grave disease,
but Cantor wasn't discouraged.
His success only spurred him
to pursue his even grander goal
to show that even uncountably
infinite sets could be placed
in a definitive order.
What Cantor called a well-order.
For a set to be well ordered,
he required two conditions.
First, the set must have
a clear starting point.
And second, every subset,
a collection of items
from that set, must also
have a clear starting point.
So for example, the natural
numbers are well ordered,
there's a starting point, one,
and any subset, say six, seven, eight,
also has a clear starting point.
In this case, six, you always
know which number comes before
and which comes next.
But what about the integers?
Integers stretch off to
infinity in both the positive
and negative directions.
Well Cantor realized
he could just pick zero
as the starting point
and from there his ordering
went one, negative one, two,
negative two, ranking the
integers by their absolute value,
their distance from zero.
It doesn't matter if you
put the positives first
or the negatives first, as
long as you are consistent.
Ordering them this way is
actually what allows us
to map the integers to the natural numbers
and see that both sets are the same size,
but there are other ways we
could well order the integers.
We could start with zero
and then have one, two, three,
all the way to positive infinity
and then negative one,
negative two, negative three,
all the way to negative infinity.
This is not how we're used to counting,
but both of these options
fit the definition
of a well ordering.
There's a clear starting point, zero,
and all their subsets also have
a definitive starting point.
Cantor had successfully well ordered a set
that was infinite in both directions,
but it was only countably infinite.
In his next book, he published
his well ordering theorem.
It claimed that every set,
even the uncountably infinite
ones like the real numbers
could be well ordered.
The problem was he hadn't
actually proven this
because he couldn't, every
method he tried had failed,
but there was one big reason that Cantor
was so confident in his theorem.
Cantor was a devout Lutheran
and he believed God was
speaking through him.
He said, my theory
stands as firm as a rock.
Every arrow directed
against it will return
quickly to its archer.
How do I know this?
Because I have studied it
from all sides for many years
and above all because I have
followed its roots so to speak,
to the first infallible
cause of all created things.
Belief notwithstanding,
the well ordering theorem
was a lofty claim
to make without any mathematical proof.
And so for the second time,
the mathematical community attacked
and ostracized Cantor.
Leading the charge was Leopold Kronecker,
the head of mathematics at
the University of Berlin.
Kronecker completely dismissed
Cantor's work, labeling him
a scientific charlatan and
a corrupter of the youth.
And Kronecker used to be Cantor's teacher.
Cantor dreamed of joining him
at the University of Berlin,
but all his applications
were mysteriously denied.
So Cantor took the rejection personally.
In 1884, he wrote 52 letters to a friend
and every one of them bemoaned Kronecker.
Soon Cantor suffered
what would be the first
of many nervous breakdowns.
He was confined to a
sanitarium for recovery.
The only way he could prove everyone wrong
was by well ordering the real numbers,
but he couldn't find a
starting point, literally.
Once Cantor was released
from the sanatorium,
he stepped away from math, a broken man.
And over the next 15
years he taught philosophy
and rarely dabbled in his old pursuits.
Perhaps his greatest challenge came
at the 1904 International
Congress of mathematicians.
There, Julius König, a respected
professor from Budapest,
announced he had proof
that Cantor's well
ordering theorem was wrong.
In the audience was not only Cantor
but also his wife, two of his
daughters and his colleagues.
He felt utterly humiliated,
but there was also another in attendance.
Ernst Zermelo.
Zermelo was a German mathematician
who had recently developed a
keen interest in Cantor's work
and as he listened to
König's presentation,
something felt off.
Within 24 hours, Zermelo
had pinpointed the problem.
König's proof contained
a damning contradiction,
and within a month, Zermello
published a three-page article
titled "Proof That Every
Set Can Be Well-Ordered"
and it was flawless.
Zermelo's breakthrough came
when he discovered something
profound in Cantor's work,
a mechanism which Cantor
uses unconsciously
and instinctively everywhere,
but formulates explicitly nowhere.
See, all along, Cantor had been assuming
that he could make an infinite number
of choices at once from any set,
including uncountable infinite
sets like the real numbers,
but this was just an assumption.
Nowhere in the mathematical rule book
was this explicitly permitted
and math is built on
rules, specifically axioms.
Axioms are simple statements we accept
as true without proof.
Zermelo realized Cantor's
assumption needed
to be formalized into something
that holds up in a system of proof.
A new axiom that said, making all
of those choices was possible.
He needed the axiom of choice.
- The axiom of choice
can be said in the sense
that if you have infinitely many sets
and each set is not
empty, then there is a way
to choose one element
from each of the sets.
- For finite sets, this seems obvious,
just go set by set and pick something.
Even for infinite sets, it's
easy if there's a clear rule,
like always choose the smallest thing,
but sometimes there is no natural rule.
In those cases when you're choosing
from infinitely many sets,
including the uncountable ones,
you need the axiom of choice.
We can't say how we're choosing,
but the axiom makes all of
these choices all at once.
The axiom doesn't allow you
to say which element you've chosen,
only that infinitely many
choices are possible.
So how does this new axiom enable us
to well order the real numbers.
Zermelo uses the axiom of choice
to choose a number from the
set of all real numbers.
He places this number, let's
call it X1 into a new set, R.
The axiom then allows him
to choose another number from the subset
of all reals minus the one taken out.
He calls this number X2
and places it as the
next number in his set
and he keeps doing this,
taking the chosen number
and placing it next, X3, X4, X5.
Now it feels like he's choosing
these numbers one at a time,
but in reality the choices are made
from all possible
subsets at the same time.
As Zermelo indexes each number
with the natural numbers,
at first it might seem like
he'd run into a problem
because the natural numbers
are only accountably infinite,
whereas there are way more reals.
So he should eventually run out of labels,
but we can count beyond infinity.
We did it earlier when we
counted past positive infinity
to get to negative one,
negative two and so on.
So we just need a new set of numbers
that extends past the naturals,
call the next number omega,
then omega plus one,
omega plus two, and so on.
These omega numbers are
not bigger than infinity.
They just come after infinity.
They don't tell us how
many things are there,
but they do tell us their order.
So the next number we pull
out, we'll label it X omega,
then X omega plus one, X
omega plus two, and so on.
This will continue until we match the size
of the real numbers and
our original set is empty.
Now every real number is in our new set.
There is a first number, X1,
and every subset also has a first number.
And just like that, we have
successfully well ordered
the real numbers.
This order looks nothing
like our familiar ordering.
A billion could come before 0.2,
but with this process, we can prove
that a well ordering exists.
And more than that, we now
have a way to resolve our issue
of how to choose mathematically.
We can't pick a smallest real number,
but now we can pick a first
real number, our starting point,
and we can do this for any set,
meaning all sets can be well
ordered no matter the infinity.
So Cantor's well-ordering theorem
and Zermelo's axiom of
choice are equivalent.
Cantor was so relieved.
Zermelo had proved the
well-ordering theorem
and well ordered the real
numbers all in under a month.
Zermelo took something mathematicians
had unknowingly relied on for decades
and turned it into a formal axiom.
He showed that understanding
math isn't just about numbers,
it's about the logic behind them.
And lately I've been trying
to do a similar thing,
but with AI where I'm trying

how models like ChatGPT work,

And now back to the axiom of choice.
The axiom of choice may
have been a new idea,
but its use was anything but.
Zermelo scanned dozens of
papers from other mathematicians
and realized they had also
been using the axiom all along,
even those who had
criticized Cantor's work.
- It just goes to show
how unintuitive it is
that it's even an axiom.
People had been using it for
like a decade, unknowingly.
- But this almost seems too obvious.
Zermelo's proof didn't actually
construct a well order.
It just said one must exist,
but can something exist if
we can't actually build it?
His proof also used an
uncountable number of steps,
was that even allowed?
Some mathematicians argued
proofs should be finite,
others accepted infinity,
but only the countable kind
and then things got worse.
When mathematicians played
around with the axiom of choice,
it created disturbing results.
One of the first came from
Giuseppe Vitali in 1905.
Vitali used the axiom of choice
to build a set of numbers
that shattered our idea of what it means
for something to have length.
So what Vitali does is he
takes every real number
between zero and one
and assigns it to one of
an infinite number of bins.
Let's call these bins groups.
So we want each real number
to end up in exactly one
of our infinite bins.
So how does he do it?
Well, let's say we have
two numbers, X and Y.
If their difference, X minus Y is equal
to a rational, that is one integer
divided by another
integer, well then both X
and Y will go into the same bin.
But if we have two other
numbers, let's say P
and Q and their difference
is not a rational,
so it's an irrational difference,
well then those two numbers
will go into separate bins.
So let's do some examples.
If this is 3/4 minus a half,
then we get a quarter and
so both 3/4 and a half
will go into the same bin.
In fact, you can see
that all rational numbers
from this span, zero to one,
they'll all end up in the same group.
Now if you have irrational numbers,
well it's not clear whether
they will go into the same bin
or not because for example,
if we have the number
root two over two minus
say root two over two
minus a quarter, well then
that does have a rational
difference even though
each of these numbers is irrational.
So these two numbers will
go into the same group,
but if we have irrational
numbers root two over two
minus root two over three,
well that gives an irrational difference.
So root two over three will
have to go into a different bin
and it will be joined
by all of the numbers
it has a rational difference from.
And in this way, you can
assign each real number
to exactly one of these bins.
Next, Vitali used the axiom of choice
to reach into each group
and select exactly one number,
which would be a
representative of the group.
So we could pull out 3/4
from the rational group,
root two over two from this group,
root two over three from
that group and so on.
Though of course because we're
using the axiom of choice,
you don't actually know what
that representative number is,
just that you have one.
So we could write it down like this.
We have these representatives
from each group
and together they form the Vitali set.
You can visualize this set
as a collection of points
between zero and one.
Next, Vitali makes
infinite copies of his set
and each one he shifts by
a different rational number
between negative one and positive one.
So if you think about what that does,
it's gonna move each representative number
to be at the position of every
other number in its group.
If we just had the one rational
number that we plucked out
as a representative
from the rational group,
now we're gonna shift it by
every possible rational number
between negative one and positive one.
So it's going to end up at
every other position occupied
by the other members of its
group, at least on the span
between zero and one.
So if you imagine now merging
all of these infinite sets together,
there's gonna be no
overlap between the points.
And second, we are going
to have every real number
between zero and one
because on that span we have
every member of every group.
So now the question is what is the size
of the Vitali set?
Now we know that the union
of those sets must be
greater than or equal to one
because we have every real
number between zero and one,
but also these points only
extend out as far as negative one
or positive two.
So it must be less than or equal to three,
but this is where the problem arises
because what number for the size
of the Vitali set could you add
to itself infinitely many times
and end up with a value
between one and three?
There is no number like that.
I mean if the size of
the Vitali set was zero,
you add it up infinitely,
many times you still get zero.
If the size of the Vitali set
is a small positive value,
then you add it up infinitely many times,
you're gonna get infinity, not three.
So we have a contradiction
and the only way out is
if the Vitali set itself
is unmeasurable, which seems crazy.
Non-measurable sets like the
Vitali set have no consistent
definition of size or length
or area or even probability.
But math is built on the idea
that everything can be
quantified, whether it's distance,
time, or weight, except now
there are non-measurable sets
and it seems like the axiom
of choice is to blame.
This was just the start of the
uproar caused by the axiom.
In 1924, two mathematicians, Stefan Banach
and Alfred Tarski used
it to show something
that looks like a magic trick.
They proved you could
take a single solid ball
and split it into just five pieces,
and then by carefully rotating
and moving those pieces,
you could reassemble them
into two balls each identical
to the one we started with,
and you could keep going
until eventually you have
an infinite number of balls,
infinity all from one.
This sounds absurd,
but we can actually see how
it works by building a graph.
Imagine you can move in four directions,
up, down, left and right.
After taking a step, say to the left,
you get the same four choices,
up, down, left and right,
but if you go to the right, you'll end up
back where you started.
So the only rule we're gonna have is
that you can't immediately reverse a move,
and we'll keep repeating
this at every step,
drawing each new line, half
the size of the previous one
so it all fits on the screen.
If we keep going, we'll end up
with this infinitely branching graph.
Looking at our graph, we can
break it into five sections.
There's the middle
section where we started,
and then there are four other sections
that are all identical, just rotated.
So if we take this section to the left
and we move everything
one step to the right,
the top part ends up here,
the bottom part here,
and the leftmost part here,
then we've almost
recreated the entire graph.
The only thing we're
missing is this section,
so let's add it back in,
but we could have done the same thing
in a completely different way
by taking the bottom section
and moving it one step up.
Now the leftmost part ends up
here, the rightmost part here
and the bottom here.
Again, we're just missing one section,
so let's add it back in.
But this means I can recreate
the entire original graph
in two completely different ways.
We took one graph, split it into sections,
shifted the sections, so the
left section went to the right
and the down section up
and somehow ended up with
two identical copies.
This is exactly what
Banach and Tarski did,
but with a ball, like our
graph, we again have four moves.
We can rotate the ball
up, down, left or right,
and again, our only rule is
that we can't immediately reverse a move.
And to make sure we never
come back to the same point,
every rotation will be
by the same irrational
portion of a circle.
We can pick a random
starting point, mark it
and then start rotating the ball.
Each point is colored
based on the direction
of rotation used to get there.
If we do this an infinite
number of times, we end up
with this collection of points.
This is a countably infinite collection
because we could list each rotation
and assign it a natural number,
but the surface of a ball has
uncountably infinite points
just like the real number line.
So if we want to cover the
entire surface, we would need
to repeat this process,
but where do we start next?
Since there are uncountably
infinite possible
starting points, we can't list them all
and we wanna be sure to avoid any points
we've already colored.
So the solution is to
use the axiom of choice.
With it, we can choosing
unique starting points,
even though we can't say exactly
how we are choosing them.
Once we've colored
every point on the ball,
we can split the points into five groups,
one for the starting points
and four others based on
the final rotation used
to arrive at those points.
These groups can now be treated
just like the sections of our graph.
We can take the group of points that end
with a left rotation and
rotate it to the right.
Then we add in the group that
ends with a right rotation,
and just like that, we've
recreated our original ball
and we can do it again making
an extra move to account
for the starting points.
We can equally take the group
that ends with a down rotation
and rotate it upwards.
Then we add in the group
that ends with an up rotation
and our starting points,
and now we've recreated our
original ball a second time.
Now, this is a bit of
an oversimplification,
but it gives you the
essence of how this is done.
From one ball, we have
created two identical balls
of the same volume,
and nothing stops us
from doing this again.
Two balls can become
four, four become eight,
and before you know it,
you've got infinite balls.
- The axiom of choice is
something that's so obviously true
and it's consequences
are so obviously false
that you're like, what
the hell is going on?
- This infinite duplication
is theoretically possible,
but the catch is the groups
we split the ball into
aren't simple shapes.
They're actually non-measurable,
just like the Vitali set,
although the original ball has a volume
and the duplicated balls have a volume,
the step in between violates
our understanding of size.
This is what allows the paradox to happen.
- Of course, those are not
physically plausible cuts,
but like there's a more
meta physical question like,
should this even remotely be possible
if we could make such cuts?
And the answer to almost
every human I know
is absolutely not.
- The truth is no one
knew what was going on.
That same year, Tarski
tried to push the axiom
of choice further proving it
is equivalent to the statement
that squaring any infinite set
would not increase its size.
When Tarski first submitted
this work to a journal in Paris,
the editor Lebesgue
responded dismissively,
nobody's interested in the equivalence
between two false statements.
Not to be deterred, Tarski
sent it to a different editor
at the same journal, Freche, his response,
nobody's interested in the equivalence
of two obviously true statements.
Tarski never submitted
a paper there again.
So math was in crisis for over 30 years
with people not knowing what to believe.
- The question is, wait a
second, is this really an axiom
or is this something that you can prove?
- In 1938, we finally
started getting some answers.
The Austrian mathematician, Kurt Godel,
proved there is a world all
the other already accepted
axioms of set theory hold true,
and so does the axiom of choice.
Then in 1963, Paul Cohen
proved there's also a world
where all the axioms
of set theory hold true
except for the axiom of choice.
This is kind of like the
parallel postulate in geometry.
You can think of geometry as a game.
The first four postulates
or axioms are like the
minimum rules required to play
that game, and then the fifth axiom
selects the universe
that you wanna play in.
If you choose that the
fifth axiom doesn't hold,
so there are no parallel lines,
then you're playing in spherical geometry.
If you choose one parallel line,
you're playing in flat geometry,
and if you choose more
than one parallel line,
then you're playing in
hyperbolic geometry.
All of these geometries are valid.
It just depends on the
math you want to do,
and it's the same for the axiom of choice.
The axiom of choice can neither be proven
nor disproven from the other axioms.
So as long as the other
axioms are consistent,
adding choice won't lead
to any contradictions.
Paul Cohen was awarded the
Fields Medal three years later
for his groundbreaking result,
as well as his other work in
set theory, and after Godel
and Cohen's work, most of the debates
about the axiom of choice died down.
- In the end, what the hell
is going on is that it's up
to you whether you want to
choose for the axiom of choice
to be a part of your system or not,
and face the consequences
of either having it or not having it.
- Despite the counterintuitive
results created
by the axiom of choice,
like non-measurable sets
and infinite duplication,
it is incredibly useful,
choice allows mathematicians
to replace lengthy explicit proofs
with more concise arguments.
By proving statements in the finite case,
many proofs can be extended
to any infinite case in just one line.
This reduces proofs that
could have been 20 pages
to just half a page.
And the axiom of choice
doesn't just make math easier.
It is essential to some proofs.
There are many theorems
where the general case
can't be proven without
using choice somewhere.
Now, some mathematicians still
prefer proofs without choice,
even if it's harder,
the proof has to be spelled
out step by step to generalize
to infinite cases, and this
provides additional information.
Some mathematicians spend
their time studying universes
without the axiom of choice to understand
what happens when we remove it.
But today, the axiom of choice
is almost universally accepted.
For the past 80 plus years,
generations of mathematicians
have been taught with choice as a given
to the point where many
who use the axiom of choice
might not even realize
when they're doing it.
- If you don't include
the axiom of choice,
then you're kind of working
with both hands tied behind your back.
It's very hard to make any
progress on modern math.
- So the question was never really
is the axiom of choice right?
But rather is the axiom of choice right
for what you want to do?
