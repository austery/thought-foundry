So
 the
 first
 day
 that
 I
 joined
 Figma,
 I


remember
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 a
 presentation


and
 Dylan
 was
 kind
 of
 walking
 me
 through


stuff,
 showing
 the
 product
 and
 the
 name


of
 the
 tool
 at
 the
 time
 was
 actually


called
 Summit.
 And
 I
 remember
 I
 thought


to
 myself
 like
 this
 just
 isn't
 going
 to


work.
 Metrics
 are
 so
 important,
 but
 I


feel
 like
 when
 you're
 doing
 something


really
 early
 and
 you're
 like,
 I
 have
 to


10x
 this,
 I
 have
 to
 100x
 this,
 I
 have


to,000x
 this,
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 go


more
 on
 intuition
 and
 more
 on
 feeling,
 I


think,
 and
 really
 believe
 that
 because


metrics
 just
 aren't
 going
 to
 get
 you
 the


answers
 that
 you're
 looking
 for.
 If
 you


joined
 Figma,
 you
 had
 to
 start
 spending


time
 answering
 support
 questions.
 And
 so


it
 sounds
 like
 pretty
 un
 unscalable,


right?
 Oh,
 you
 have
 your
 engineers


sitting
 there
 answering
 support
 tickets,


fixing
 bugs,
 like
 you
 can't
 do
 that


forever.
 That
 doesn't
 scale.
 But


actually,
 it
 does
 scale.
 You
 think
 about


people
 as
 companies.
 And
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 advice
 that
 I
 would
 give
 is
 like


people
 are
 people,
 right?
 And
 I
 think


you
 see
 that
 it
 can conf
 like
 you'll
 see


people
 and
 you'll
 talk
 to
 them
 and


you'll
 be
 chatting.
 It
 sounds
 so
 basic,


right?
 But
 like
 I
 think
 so
 often
 in


marketing
 we
 we
 split
 people
 into
 like


you
 as
 a
 person
 at
 your
 desk
 and
 you
 as


a
 person
 outside
 of
 that.
 Whereas
 we
 try


to
 think
 of
 people
 as
 one
 person.
 It


wasn't
 like
 let's
 have
 a
 communitydriven


strategy.
 It
 was
 just
 we
 need
 to
 listen


to
 our
 users
 and
 we
 need
 to
 build
 a


product
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 useful


for
 them
 and
 they
 know
 what
 their


problems
 are
 more
 than
 we
 do
 and
 we
 need


to
 spend
 time
 with
 them
 and
 and
 fix


their
 problems.


[Applause]


Hi,
 I'm
 Claire.
 Uh,
 I'm
 the
 director
 of


brand
 marketing
 here
 at
 Figma.
 I
 was


also
 the
 first
 marketer
 and
 yeah,
 I've


been
 here
 since
 the
 beginning.
 So,


coming
 up
 on
 9
 years
 of
 Figma.
 So,
 it's


been
 it's
 really
 fun
 for
 me
 to
 see


everything
 come
 together
 today.


My
 name
 is
 Cory.
 I'm
 designer
 advocate


here
 at
 Figma.
 Um,
 I'm
 based
 in
 Tokyo


and
 I've
 been
 here
 at
 Figma
 for
 about
 2


years
 and
 been
 a
 longtime
 Figma
 user
 in


community.
 As
 a
 designer
 advocate,
 I'm


part
 of
 our
 community
 team.
 My
 role
 is
 a


mixture
 of
 helping
 build
 community
 but


while
 also
 helping
 enable
 um
 designers.


So
 um
 could
 you
 give
 us
 an
 overview
 of


your
 career
 um
 before
 joining
 Figma?


Sure.
 Uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 funny.
 It's
 hard


to
 remember
 a
 time
 before
 Figma
 because


I've
 been
 here
 for
 uh
 9
 years.
 I
 was
 at


another
 startup
 before
 that
 called


Climate
 Corporation
 and
 Index
 Ventures


was
 one
 of
 the
 investors
 in
 uh
 Climate


Corp.
 and
 we
 got
 acquired
 and
 you
 know
 I


kind
 of
 knew
 a
 big
 company
 wasn't
 for
 me


and
 I
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 roll
 up
 my


sleeves
 and
 and
 do
 something
 early


stage.
 So
 Danny
 Rhyr
 who
 is
 was
 the
 lead


investor
 over
 at
 the
 last
 company
 I
 was


at
 uh
 also
 invested
 was
 the
 first
 seed


investor
 for
 Dylan.
 So
 um
 I
 was
 meeting


a
 bunch
 of
 different
 startups
 and


different
 companies
 and
 uh
 Danny


introduced
 me
 to
 Dylan
 and
 I
 met
 Dylan


and
 kind
 of
 just
 decided
 that
 that
 was


it
 and
 that's
 that's
 you
 know
 went
 from


there.
 When
 I
 started
 at
 Figma,
 we
 were


pretty
 launched.
 So,
 there
 was
 there


wasn't
 even
 a
 product.
 There
 wasn't
 a


company,
 you
 know,
 there
 wasn't
 even
 a


name,
 honestly.
 We
 were
 going
 to
 name
 it


something
 else
 at
 the
 beginning.
 So,
 I
 I


think
 back
 to
 just
 how
 much
 we've
 grown


and
 evolved
 over
 the
 past
 9
 years
 and


where
 we
 are
 today.
 And
 it
 really
 blows


my
 mind.
 It's
 just
 so
 amazing
 to
 see
 the


excitement.
 I
 just
 got
 emotional


watching
 all
 the
 people
 come
 in
 and
 just


how
 many
 people
 how
 many
 how
 much
 Figma


means
 to
 so
 many
 people
 and
 how
 many


people
 love
 it
 and
 use
 it
 every
 day.


It's
 just
 a
 surreal
 moment
 for
 me
 to
 see


everything
 come
 together.
 What
 was
 the


first
 thing
 that
 you
 did
 after
 you


joined
 Figma?
 Literal
 first
 thing
 I
 did.


So
 the
 first
 day
 that
 I
 joined
 Figma,
 I


remember
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 a
 presentation


and
 Dylan
 was
 kind
 of
 walking
 me
 through


stuff,
 showing
 the
 product,
 also
 showing


me
 where
 to
 like
 the
 bathroom
 was
 like


all
 of
 the
 basics
 that
 you
 get
 on
 your


first
 day.
 And
 uh
 I
 saw
 one
 presentation


where
 they
 were
 going
 through
 some
 of


the
 branding
 for
 Figma
 and
 some
 of
 the


different
 naming
 and
 how
 they
 were


thinking
 about
 launching
 it.
 And
 the


name
 of
 the
 tool
 at
 the
 time
 was


actually
 called
 Summit.
 And
 so
 um
 Figma


was
 always
 the
 name
 of
 the
 company,
 but


we
 had
 the
 strategy
 at
 the
 time
 where


the
 tool
 would
 be
 called
 Summit
 and
 like


the
 Figma
 editor.
 And
 then
 the
 company


would
 be
 called
 Figma.
 And
 I
 remember
 I


thought
 to
 myself
 like
 this
 just
 isn't


going
 to
 work.
 Like
 uh
 nobody
 knows
 who


we
 are.
 Summit
 is
 just
 like
 a
 really


basic
 name.
 There's
 PCs
 named
 Summit.


There's
 apps
 named
 Summit.
 This
 isn't


anything
 we
 can
 own.
 And
 so
 I
 remember


saying
 just
 kind
 of
 off
 the
 cuff
 like,


"Hey,
 like
 how
 locked
 is
 this?
 Is
 this


something
 we
 can
 change?"
 And
 Dylan
 was


like,
 "Yeah,
 what
 do
 you
 think?"
 And
 and


I
 was
 like, "Well,
 I
 I
 really
 think
 we


should
 probably
 only
 have
 one
 name.
 We


can't
 really
 have
 two."
 Um,
 and
 he's


like,
 "Well,
 well,
 how
 about
 you
 think


about
 that
 more
 and
 make
 a
 presentation


and
 and
 maybe
 can
 show
 everybody
 it
 and


then
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 it."
 And
 I
 said,


"Okay,
 cool.
 Like
 what
 does
 what
 does


the
 timeline
 look
 like
 for
 that?"
 And
 he


said,
 "How
 about
 tomorrow?"
 And
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay."
 And
 so
 uh
 I
 remember
 the


literal
 first
 thing
 I
 did
 on
 my
 first


day
 was
 um
 make
 a
 presentation
 about
 how


the
 product
 should
 be
 called
 Figma
 and


not
 Summit.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 first
 thing


I
 did.
 When
 Figma
 first
 launched
 people


saying
 especially
 among
 designers
 like


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 liking
 the


product
 but
 also
 saying
 oh
 if
 this
 is


the
 future
 of
 design
 then
 I
 would
 quit


design
 or
 like
 this
 is
 not
 the
 future
 I


want
 as
 a
 designer.
 So,
 as
 a
 first


marketer
 at
 uh
 Figma,
 like
 what
 were


your
 like
 go
 to
 market
 strategy
 or
 like


how
 did
 you
 deal
 with
 these
 market


response?
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 it's
 really


interesting
 because
 as
 a
 marketer


working
 online
 and
 collaboratively,
 it's


it's
 just
 intuitive
 to
 me,
 right?
 Like


was
 used
 to
 using
 Google
 Docs,
 was
 used


to
 just
 having
 Google
 Slides,
 a
 sauna,


these
 things
 where
 you
 just
 have
 things


constantly
 updated
 and
 working
 really


collaboratively.
 But
 it
 didn't
 really


click
 for
 me
 until
 I
 saw
 the
 response.


Honestly,
 that,
 you
 know,
 before
 design


didn't
 really
 work
 that
 way.
 People
 were


used
 to
 working
 in
 these
 offline
 tools


and
 sharing
 when
 they're
 done
 and
 doing


these
 like
 beautiful
 presentations
 and


showing
 kind
 of
 more
 of
 a
 finished


product.
 Um,
 and
 so
 yeah,
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 questioning
 uh
 of
 that
 in
 the


early
 days.
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a


couple
 things
 that
 I
 keep
 in
 mind
 when
 I


think
 of
 like
 how
 to
 approach
 something


like
 that.
 The
 first
 is,
 you
 know,
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 level
 of
 confidence
 that


you're
 going
 to
 keep
 going
 anyway,


right?
 Like
 there's
 some
 people
 who


don't
 like
 it.
 There's
 different


adoption
 curves
 and
 it's
 okay.
 Not


everyone
 likes
 your
 product
 right
 away.


So
 this
 just
 having
 a
 general
 confidence


in
 that
 and
 a
 belief
 that
 that's
 the
 way


to
 go
 and
 that's
 the
 vision
 and
 we're


going
 to
 stick
 with
 it
 is
 very


important.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 the
 other


thing
 that
 we
 did
 that
 was
 really
 really


helpful
 was
 we
 really
 looked
 at
 design


is
 an
 interesting
 space
 where
 uh
 you


know
 people
 really
 learn
 from
 each
 other


and
 so
 people
 are
 always
 looking
 to


other
 influencers
 or
 other
 people
 to


help
 understand
 you
 know
 what's
 the


latest
 in
 design
 how
 do
 you
 work
 how


should
 we
 work
 so
 we
 really
 built
 a
 lot


of
 relationships
 and
 focused
 on
 building


relationships
 with
 people
 who
 had
 a
 lot


of
 thought
 in
 the
 space
 a
 lot
 of
 thought


leadership
 and
 um
 talked
 to
 them
 about


things.
 So
 even
 if
 they
 had
 a
 negative


reaction
 at
 first
 or
 weren't
 sure
 about


something
 we
 were
 doing,
 we
 just
 engaged


in
 conversation
 and
 talked
 about
 it
 and


uh
 you
 know
 over
 time
 heard
 their


opinions,
 we
 shared
 our
 opinions,
 got


feedback
 from
 them
 and
 that
 was
 a
 a


really
 important
 thing
 where
 maybe


initially
 people
 had
 concerns
 but
 as
 we


built
 trust
 with
 them,
 built


credibility,
 uh
 people
 started
 using
 the


tool
 that
 was
 really
 important
 and
 they


changed
 their
 minds.
 I'm
 also
 curious


like
 Corey
 your
 response
 when
 you
 first


got
 to
 know
 Figma
 but
 as
 a
 designer


didn't
 didn't
 you
 have
 any
 like
 mixed


feelings
 towards
 the
 product
 or
 as
 a


designer
 like
 what
 were
 your
 thoughts
 on


the
 product
 as
 a
 designer
 at
 the
 time
 I


was
 using
 Figma
 this
 was
 probably
 like


2016
 2017
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 design


tools
 were
 coming
 out
 like
 when
 every


week
 seemed
 like
 there
 was
 different


design
 tool
 like
 and
 I
 was
 you
 know


using
 one
 tool
 as
 my
 main
 tool
 but
 like


I
 would
 be
 using
 another
 tool
 beta


testing
 it
 like
 on
 the
 side
 and
 like


recreating
 the
 design
 like
 every
 week


and
 testing
 you
 know,
 these
 AB
 testing,


these
 design
 choices
 to
 see
 like
 which


one
 is
 the
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 one,


which
 one
 I
 just
 I
 switched
 to
 and
 like


through
 that
 whole
 process,
 like
 one
 of


them
 I
 found
 like
 Figma
 and
 I
 was
 using


Figma
 and
 I
 I
 picked
 it
 up
 for
 a
 bit
 and


I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 this
 is
 web-
 based.


This
 is
 kind
 of
 interesting,
 but
 like
 it


doesn't
 make
 much
 difference
 compared
 to


like
 what
 I'm
 using
 now,
 right?"
 And


then
 um
 I
 went
 back
 to
 it
 for
 some


reason
 again
 to
 use
 it
 and
 I
 started


thinking
 about
 the
 collaboration


features,
 right?
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "Wait,


wait,
 you
 can
 just
 Oh,
 it's
 web-
 based.


You
 can
 just
 share
 a
 link.
 I
 don't
 have


to
 like
 export
 this
 and
 every
 single


time
 it's
 my
 final
 final
 final
 final


version.
 Send
 that
 again
 and
 then
 I
 you


know
 I
 could
 just
 share
 that
 and
 it's


always
 up
 to
 date
 and
 thinking
 about


like
 the
 repercussions
 of
 that
 of
 like


how
 that
 would
 change
 the
 way
 interact


uh
 and
 just
 reduce
 the
 friction
 I
 think


was
 just
 a
 big
 thing
 I
 think
 about
 a
 lot


of
 time
 uh
 in
 the
 process.
 So
 I
 was
 like


oh
 well
 to
 realize
 the
 value
 that
 I


actually
 have
 to
 do
 use
 this
 tool
 with


somebody
 else.
 So
 that
 the
 first
 thing
 I


did
 was
 okay
 let
 me
 find
 some
 other


people
 on
 my
 team
 that
 I
 can
 get
 to
 get


in
 the
 tool
 and
 let's
 use
 it
 together.


And
 then
 once
 I
 did
 that,
 they


understood
 it.
 I
 understood
 it.
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 game
 changer."


You
 know,
 once
 you
 start
 using
 it


together,
 you
 just
 realize
 it's
 like


it's
 completely
 different
 experience.


And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 when
 it
 was


clicked.
 And
 then
 I
 realized
 that
 and


then
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 I
 need
 to
 get
 my


whole
 team
 on
 this.
 I
 need
 to
 get


everyone
 in
 this
 and
 get
 everyone
 in
 the


file."
 Before
 I
 was
 like
 going
 to


introduce
 my
 team
 to
 it.
 There
 was


actually
 an
 issue
 with
 like
 Japanese


input.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 back
 in
 the


day,
 like
 I
 you
 still
 have
 it
 today
 in


the
 bottom
 like
 right
 corner
 of
 Figma,


there's
 a
 little
 question
 mark
 right


there.
 And
 if
 you
 push
 that
 you
 can
 have


like
 you
 can
 send
 a
 message
 right
 to
 the


help
 desk
 and
 get
 support
 on
 that.


Right?
 So
 I
 was
 using
 Figma
 and
 when
 you


input
 the
 Japanese
 characters
 it


wouldn't
 show
 up
 correctly.
 Japanese
 was


basically
 broken
 in
 Pigma
 at
 the
 time.
 I


was
 like
 oh
 this
 is
 great
 but
 like
 I'm


in
 Japan
 and
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 designing
 in


Japanese
 so
 I
 can't
 use
 this
 on
 my
 team


until
 this
 is
 fixed,
 right?
 I
 was
 like


uh
 maybe
 I'll
 just
 try
 to
 send
 some


support
 and
 see
 what
 happens,
 you
 know?


So
 I
 I
 told
 him
 I
 I
 sent
 some


screenshots.
 I
 sent
 a
 detailed
 request


and
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 this
 thing


is
 broken
 here.
 and
 if
 you
 could
 fix


this,
 this
 would
 really
 be
 helpful
 for


your
 Japanese
 users,
 right?
 And
 then


couple
 weeks
 go
 by
 and
 I
 pick
 it
 up


again
 and
 it's
 fixed.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


wow,
 this
 is
 pretty
 nice.
 I
 was
 I
 was


like,
 the
 tool
 is
 pretty
 cool,
 but
 I
 was


like,
 what
 was
 really
 really
 cool
 was


it's
 like,
 oh,
 I
 gave
 this
 feedback
 and


then
 they
 fix
 that.
 But
 also,
 I
 know


that
 like
 they're
 accepting
 feedback


from
 the
 community
 and
 the
 speed
 of
 that


iteration
 is
 is
 something
 that
 it
 gives


me
 confidence
 that
 um
 so
 I
 think
 like


changing
 tools
 is
 like
 an
 investment
 for


the
 whole
 team.
 That
 was
 kind
 of
 me


weighing
 the
 option.
 I
 was
 just
 like,


"Okay,
 I'm
 really
 kind
 of
 investing
 in


this
 team
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 my
 team


we
 should
 use
 this
 this
 product."
 So,


you
 joined
 Figma
 before
 the
 product


launch.
 How
 did
 you
 approach
 marketing


marketing
 a
 product
 that
 was
 still
 in


self
 mode?
 So,
 I
 was
 the
 first
 marketing


hire,
 but
 I
 was
 also
 the
 first
 just
 go


to
 market
 person.
 In
 the
 beginning,
 when


we
 didn't
 have
 a
 product,
 I
 would
 go


around
 and
 drive
 around
 PaloAlto,
 San


Francisco
 with
 Dylan,
 and
 we
 would
 just


pitch
 Figma
 to
 differenti.
 We
 made
 a


bunch
 of
 connections
 in
 different
 design


teams
 and
 we
 would
 just
 go
 there
 and
 we


we'd
 show
 them
 the
 product.
 And
 so
 a
 lot


of
 what
 I
 did
 in
 the
 early
 days
 was
 meet


these
 people,
 gather
 their
 feedback,


kind
 of
 like
 what
 Corey
 was
 saying
 and


in
 that
 more
 of
 a
 one-on-one
 setting
 and


hear
 what
 they
 thought
 about
 the
 tool.


And
 then
 uh
 we
 were
 really
 trying
 to


understand
 okay
 when
 are
 we
 ready
 to
 go


at
 it
 stealth
 then
 launch
 la la la la la




la la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la
 la la la la la la la la la la la


la la la la la la la la la
 la la la la




la la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la launch
 the
 product
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of


what
 I
 was
 doing
 was
 trying
 to


understand
 you
 know
 our
 teams
 ready
 to


adopt
 this
 and
 is
 the
 the
 tool
 good


enough
 to
 launch.
 I
 think
 it's
 such
 a


balance
 that
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about


where
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 we
 want
 to
 get


out
 of
 self
 and
 want
 to
 get
 in
 this
 this


people's
 hands,
 but
 if
 it's
 not
 good


enough,
 then
 it's
 also
 like,
 well,
 we're


going
 to
 lose
 our
 chance.
 You
 only
 get


one
 shot
 to
 launch.
 And
 like,
 what
 were


some
 of
 the
 factors
 that
 made
 that


decision?
 Yeah,
 it's
 hard,
 right?
 It's


such
 a
 a
 hard
 question
 for
 people


because
 you
 really
 do
 only
 get
 one


chance
 to
 launch
 the
 product
 and
 you


want
 to
 do
 it
 right
 and
 so
 you
 want
 it


to
 be
 good
 when
 people
 are
 all
 going
 in


and
 looking
 at
 the
 tool.
 You
 want
 them


to
 have
 a
 good
 experience.
 So
 that's
 on


one
 hand,
 but
 then
 on
 the
 other
 hand,


you
 don't
 want
 to
 wait
 too
 long,
 right?


Because
 the
 tool,
 the
 team
 had
 already


been
 building
 the
 tool
 for
 years
 before


I
 got
 there.
 You
 want
 to
 keep
 things


going.
 You
 want
 to
 start
 building
 with


people
 and
 getting
 their
 feedback.
 And


so
 it
 is
 a
 really
 hard
 balance.
 It's


definitely
 more
 of
 an
 art
 than
 a
 science


in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 when
 to
 launch.


And
 I
 remember
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 this


meeting
 and
 someone
 literally
 took
 the


laptop
 out
 of
 Dylan's
 hands
 because
 they


wanted
 to
 play
 with
 it.
 I
 don't
 think


that
 they
 didn't
 mean
 to
 like
 didn't


take
 a
 laptop,
 but
 they
 were
 just
 like,


"That's
 so
 cool.
 I
 have
 to
 try
 it."
 And


I
 think
 once
 they
 saw
 people
 starting
 to


do
 that,
 that
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 this
 is


this
 feels
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 ready."
 One


of
 the
 biggest
 challenges
 that
 we
 had
 in


terms
 of
 deciding
 when
 to
 launch
 was


multiplayer
 wasn't
 actually
 done
 when
 we


launched
 Figma.
 It
 just
 was
 going
 to


take
 like
 another
 year
 for
 for


multiplayer
 to
 be
 done.
 And
 so
 that
 was


a
 really
 hard
 decision
 at
 the
 time
 where


it
 was
 like
 this
 is
 our
 most
 important


feature
 arguably
 and
 we
 know
 it's
 going


to
 take
 another
 year
 before
 it's
 done.


And
 the
 decision
 that
 we
 had
 to
 make


was,
 you
 know,
 do
 we
 launch
 without


multiplayer
 or
 do
 we
 wait
 another
 year?


And
 we
 decided
 just
 to
 go
 for
 it
 and
 to


launch
 and
 to
 start
 getting
 feedback,


start
 getting
 in
 people's
 hands,
 keep
 it


in
 beta
 even
 though
 we
 knew
 it
 wasn't


finished.
 But
 that
 is
 such
 a
 hard


challenge,
 right?
 Like
 I
 think
 there'd


be
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 arguments
 on
 why
 you


should
 wait
 uh
 for
 the
 the
 core
 feature


to
 be
 done,
 but
 it
 definitely
 becomes


kind
 of
 more
 of
 an
 art
 than
 a
 science
 at


that
 point
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 that


decision
 cuz
 you
 also
 just
 got
 to
 keep


the
 momentum
 up
 too.
 Metrics
 are
 so


important,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 can't


really
 look
 at
 them
 that
 closely
 when


you're
 in
 a
 micro
 setting
 like
 that.
 You


kind
 of
 have
 to
 go
 on
 anecdotes,
 right?


Like
 we
 didn't
 have
 enough
 people
 to


like
 have
 these
 metrics
 dashboards
 and


be
 like
 look
 at
 the
 usage
 over
 time,


right?
 Like
 honestly,
 we
 were
 meeting


these
 teams
 and
 what
 we
 looked
 at
 was


like
 at
 at
 the
 beginning,
 can
 we
 get
 one


team
 to
 transfer
 full-time?
 And
 it


sounds
 so
 funny
 because
 it's
 like
 our


metric
 was
 like
 zero
 or
 one,
 right?
 It's


not
 like
 you're
 looking
 at
 these


dashboards.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 feel
 like


sometimes
 when
 you're
 doing
 something


really
 early
 and
 you're
 like,
 I
 have
 to


10x
 this,
 I
 have
 to
 100x
 this.
 I
 have
 to


thousandx
 this.
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 go


more
 on
 intuition
 and
 more
 on
 feeling
 I


think
 and
 really
 believe
 that
 because


metrics
 just
 aren't
 going
 to
 get
 you
 the


answers
 that
 you're
 looking
 for.
 What


were
 your
 um
 team
 or
 your
 um
 plan
 or


strategy
 on
 building
 this
 community
 and


um
 how
 important
 was
 that
 at
 the
 time?
 I


wouldn't
 say
 in
 the
 beginnings
 we
 ever


set
 out
 to
 like
 have
 a
 communitydriven


strategy.
 Kind
 of
 to
 just
 take
 to


parallel
 Corey's
 story
 with
 what
 was


happening
 at
 Figma
 at
 the
 time.
 In
 the


early
 days
 of
 Figma,
 that
 little


question
 mark
 button
 that
 Cory
 was


talking
 about,
 uh
 we
 didn't
 really
 have


a
 full-time
 support
 team
 or
 it
 took
 a


while
 for
 us
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 so
 our


engineers
 would
 rotate
 and
 answer
 those


questions.
 And
 so
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 that
 somebody
 reported
 a
 bug
 and


that
 Corey
 reported
 a
 bug
 and
 then
 one


of
 our
 engineers
 saw
 that
 and
 just
 fixed


it,
 right?
 Like
 that's
 just
 kind
 of
 what


happened.
 It
 was
 really
 all
 hands
 on


deck.
 And
 Dylan,
 our
 CEO,
 really


believed
 that
 we
 need
 to
 be
 as
 close
 to


the
 users
 of
 our
 product
 as
 possible.


And
 so
 even
 even
 now
 that
 like
 up
 until


a
 long
 time
 ago
 or
 until
 recently
 if
 you


joined
 Figma
 you
 had
 to
 start
 spending


time
 answering
 support
 questions
 because


he
 wanted
 people
 to
 know
 and
 understand


what
 the
 problems
 were
 and
 be
 really


close
 to
 what
 that
 looked
 like.
 So


that's
 been
 integrated
 and
 woven
 into


who
 we
 are
 since
 the
 beginning.
 And


along
 with
 that
 it's
 really
 building
 the


product
 alongside
 of
 the
 users
 of
 the


product.
 It
 wasn't
 like
 we
 thought
 to


ourselves
 like
 let's
 have
 a


communitydriven
 strategy.
 It
 was
 just
 we


need
 to
 listen
 to
 our
 users
 and
 we
 need


to
 build
 a
 product
 that's
 going
 to
 be


really
 useful
 for
 them
 and
 they
 know


what
 their
 problems
 are
 more
 than
 we
 do


and
 we
 need
 to
 spend
 time
 with
 them
 and


and
 fix
 their
 problems.
 And
 there's


people
 like
 Corey,
 like
 Corey
 was
 one
 of


those
 people
 that
 put
 it
 went
 into
 the


chat,
 but
 there
 were
 thousands
 of
 other


Corey's.
 That
 idea
 of
 listening
 to


people
 and
 then
 having
 a
 personal


relationship,
 really
 becoming
 close
 with


them
 and
 then
 having
 them
 go
 spread


Figma
 to
 their
 company,
 to
 their


communities,
 to
 where
 they
 live.
 That's


just
 what
 we
 did
 at
 scale.
 And
 so
 it


sounds
 like
 pretty
 un
 unscalable,
 right?


Oh,
 you
 have
 your
 engineers
 sitting


there
 answering
 support
 tickets,
 fixing


bugs,
 like
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 forever.


That
 doesn't
 scale.
 But
 actually,
 it


does
 scale
 because
 once
 we
 empowered


him,
 he
 can
 burn
 it
 his
 team.
 He
 grew
 a


community
 in
 Tokyo,
 right?
 Like
 that
 has


a
 huge
 amount
 of
 ramifications
 down
 the


line.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 that


strategy
 looks
 like
 when
 it
 when
 it
 does


scale,
 right?
 It's
 it's
 how
 those
 people


these
 people
 who
 you
 really
 build
 these


strong
 relationships
 with
 then
 spread


Figma
 for
 you.
 That's
 the
 whole
 crux
 of


a
 community
 tribute
 strategy.
 The
 advice


I
 would
 give
 is
 focus
 on
 a
 niche
 because


it's
 so
 hard
 to
 be
 too
 broad,
 especially


when
 you're
 new
 and
 you're
 early
 and
 you


don't
 have
 a
 brand
 yet
 and
 find
 out
 who


your
 users
 are
 and
 have
 somebody
 who


really
 understands
 them
 be
 the
 face
 of


face
 of
 what
 you're
 doing.
 We
 definitely


started
 with
 designers.
 you
 were
 very


focused.
 It
 had
 very
 specific
 niche
 of


designers.
 They
 wanted
 someone
 who


really
 understood
 their
 pain
 points,


what
 they
 were
 going
 through,
 what
 it


was
 like
 to
 design.
 And
 that's
 when
 for


me,
 I
 realized
 that
 immediately
 and
 I


was
 like,
 I
 don't
 know
 this.
 I
 can
 study


it.
 I
 can
 I
 could
 try
 and
 and
 learn
 my


best.
 I
 I
 have
 over
 the
 years,
 but
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I'm
 not
 a


classically
 trained
 designer.
 It's
 not


my
 my
 core
 expertise.
 And
 so
 that's
 when


I
 you
 know
 I
 decided
 I
 was
 like
 we
 have


to
 hire
 somebody
 who
 knows
 this
 really


really
 really
 well
 and
 have
 them
 be
 the


face
 of
 this
 and
 having
 them
 be
 the


people
 who
 are
 talking
 with
 users
 who


are
 creating
 content
 who
 are
 checking


all
 of
 our
 marketing
 um
 who
 are
 helping


us
 do
 things
 and
 that's
 that's
 when
 we


decided
 to
 have
 a
 user
 from
 the


community
 come
 join
 the
 team
 and
 that


that
 function
 has
 scaled.
 How
 did
 you
 um


come
 up
 with
 this
 idea
 of
 having
 like
 an


offline
 um
 community
 and
 how
 did
 that
 um


scale
 also?
 Totally.
 So
 in
 the
 early


days
 uh
 we
 did
 meetups
 and
 so
 that's


what
 it
 looked
 like
 at
 the
 beginning.


Some
 people
 were
 skeptics
 in
 the


beginning,
 right?
 And
 maybe
 they'd
 want


to
 go
 to
 meet
 other
 designers
 or
 they'd


show
 up,
 but
 we
 realized
 how
 valuable
 it


was
 to
 bring
 people
 together
 and
 to


talk.
 And
 we
 just
 saw
 how
 amazing
 it
 was


when
 people
 just
 learn
 best
 practices


from
 each
 other
 um
 and
 just
 learn
 from


being
 together.
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to


build
 these
 one
 relationships,
 we
 could


kind
 of
 overcome
 some
 of
 their
 concerns


or
 talk
 them
 out
 or
 just
 kind
 of
 hear


people
 out
 on
 why
 they
 were
 skeptics
 or


why
 they
 weren't
 sure
 and
 how
 we'd
 have


these
 conversations
 and
 it
 might
 be
 I


remember
 one
 u
 Tom
 was
 in
 in
 Seattle,


Tom,
 our
 first
 designer
 advocate
 was
 in


Seattle
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 to
 somebody


who
 at
 the
 time
 was
 a
 very
 big
 skeptic,


right?
 Uh
 and
 then
 he
 kept
 talking
 to


them,
 had
 these
 relationships,
 built


this
 relationship
 with
 them.
 Turns
 out


they
 were
 at
 Uber.
 Um,
 and
 that
 person


then
 brought
 Figma
 to
 Uber,
 right?
 And


we
 saw
 the
 power
 of
 how
 that
 process


worked
 and
 we
 started
 growing
 just
 these


people
 and
 and
 having
 these


relationships.
 And
 then
 we
 had
 this


thought
 of
 like,
 well,
 wait
 a
 minute,


you
 know,
 we've
 been
 going
 to
 these


different
 cities,
 these
 different


places.
 What
 if
 we
 brought
 everyone


together,
 right?
 And
 what
 what
 would


that
 look
 like?
 And
 it
 was
 really
 funny.


I
 remember
 when
 we
 first
 had
 the
 idea,


we're
 like,
 okay,
 how
 big
 should
 it
 be?


And
 it
 sounds
 so
 funny
 and
 I
 laugh
 at
 it


now.
 It
 was
 actually
 we
 thought
 we
 were


going
 to
 be at
 200
 people
 and
 that
 was


going
 to
 be
 the
 conference
 and
 we
 even


booked
 a
 venue
 for
 200
 people
 that
 was


the
 size
 and
 we
 launched
 the
 conference


and
 in
 the
 first
 day
 we
 had
 so
 many


registrations
 and
 people
 who
 wants
 to


join
 that
 we're
 like
 okay
 we
 have
 to


change
 the
 size
 of
 this
 thing
 because


there's
 no
 way
 200
 people
 is
 going
 to


work.
 Um
 and
 so
 expanded
 it
 and
 so
 the


first
 config
 was
 a
 thousand
 people.
 We


have
 all
 these
 relationships.
 People


have
 these
 connections
 online
 and


because
 of
 just
 the
 distributed
 nature


and
 the
 global
 nature
 of
 design,
 people


have
 been
 talking
 to
 each
 other
 on


Twitter
 for
 so
 long.
 But
 then
 they
 all


came
 together
 in
 person
 and
 it
 was
 just


pure
 magic
 to
 see
 these
 people.
 I


remember
 so
 many
 that
 the
 line
 the


conversation
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 not


what
 your
 avatar
 looks
 like
 on
 Twitter."


Because
 this
 there's
 a
 strong
 community


that
 existed
 and
 that
 people
 were


already
 meeting
 each
 other
 and
 talking


that
 we've
 been
 doing
 from
 these


meetups,
 but
 also
 just
 from
 the
 nature


of
 design.
 designers
 have
 been
 talking


and
 learning
 to
 each
 other
 regardless
 of


BIGMA
 for
 so
 long
 and
 so
 bringing


everybody
 together
 in
 person
 and
 having


these
 relationships
 that
 were
 just


online
 happen
 in
 real
 life
 was
 just
 so


magical
 that
 we
 just
 knew
 we
 had
 to


continue
 like
 so
 do
 you
 have
 any
 like


advice
 on
 like
 building
 communities
 for


early
 startups?
 Totally.
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 thing
 is
 that
 sometimes
 in
 in


you
 know
 especially
 for
 us
 in
 you
 know


enterprise
 marketing
 or
 B2B
 marketing


you
 think
 about
 people
 as
 companies
 and


I
 think
 the
 biggest
 advice
 that
 I
 would


give
 is
 like
 people
 are
 people
 right
 and


I
 think
 you
 see
 that
 it
 can
 fit
 like


you'll
 see
 people
 and
 you'll
 talk
 to


them
 and
 you'll
 be
 chatting
 and
 then
 you


look
 at
 their
 badge
 and
 you're
 like
 oh


you
 work
 at
 a
 really
 big
 company
 oh
 that


was
 a
 company
 that
 in
 theory
 you
 might


want
 to
 like
 target
 for
 sales
 but
 that's


not
 how
 we
 think
 of
 it
 we're
 just
 like


you're
 just
 a
 person
 and
 you
 have


interest
 like
 it
 sounds
 so
 basic
 right


but
 like
 I
 think
 So
 often
 in
 marketing,


we
 we
 split
 people
 into
 like
 you
 as
 a


person
 at
 your
 desk
 and
 you
 as
 a
 person


outside
 of
 that,
 whereas
 we
 try
 to
 think


of
 people
 as
 one
 person
 and
 you
 can
 just


you're
 yourself
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 sure,


you
 happen
 to
 work
 at
 a
 company,
 but
 uh


I
 think
 it's
 doing
 these
 things
 that


don't
 scale
 and
 building
 these


relationships
 one-on-one
 like
 like
 Gory


and
 Gory's
 example
 and
 then
 those
 people


bring
 other
 people
 and
 those
 then
 that's


how
 word
 of
 mouth
 really
 spreads.
 So


Figma
 is
 beyond
 just
 a
 product.
 It
 seems


like
 it's
 a
 brand,
 it's
 a
 community.
 So,


um,
 what
 are
 your
 advice
 on
 yeah,
 making


a
 brand,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 to
 actually
 start


with
 a
 product
 for
 us
 and
 that's
 like


what
 productled
 growth
 looks
 like,


right?
 And
 I
 I
 think
 that
 what
 we
 have


as
 a
 brand
 really
 starts
 with
 a
 brave


product
 by
 starting
 from
 the
 bottom
 up


and
 saying
 like,
 okay,
 first
 we
 have
 a


really
 strong
 product
 that's
 awesome.


We're
 improving
 it
 as
 we
 go.
 We're


listening
 to
 feedback
 um
 as
 we're


building
 it
 and
 building
 it
 with
 the


community.
 And
 then
 second,
 we
 have
 you


know
 these
 relationships
 with
 people
 and


if
 those
 people
 love
 the
 product,


they're
 spreading
 it
 to
 other
 people
 and


that's
 that's
 growing
 over
 time
 of


community
 of
 people.
 Then
 we
 can
 do
 it,


right?
 And
 then
 we
 can
 say,
 okay,
 now
 we


want
 to
 layer
 on
 top
 all
 these
 other


things
 like
 a
 10,000
 person
 conference


or
 like
 um
 you
 know
 all
 these
 beautiful


visuals
 that
 we
 have.
 The
 story
 of
 Figma


is
 not
 about
 ending
 at
 Figma.
 The
 story


about
 Figma
 is
 where
 does
 Figma
 get
 in


that
 person
 too.
 And
 in
 most
 cases,
 you


know,
 people
 using
 Figma,
 their
 story
 is


something
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 want
 to


create
 great
 products.
 I
 want
 to
 enjoy


the
 process
 and
 create
 that
 product


together.
 So,
 the
 narrative
 that
 we're


creating
 on
 the
 community
 side
 is
 often


like,
 how
 do
 we
 just
 enable
 those
 people


to
 get
 to
 where
 they
 want
 to
 go?
 Do
 you


know
 where
 the
 name
 Pigma
 comes
 from?


It's
 It
 would
 be
 great
 if
 you
 can


explain
 it
 to
 us.
 Yeah,
 it's
 actually
 it


comes
 from
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 figment
 of
 your


imagination.
 And
 the
 initial
 vision
 of


Fikba
 was
 uh
 to
 eliminate
 the
 gap


between
 imagination
 and
 reality.
 Like


that
 was
 that
 was
 the
 vision.
 And
 so


they
 it
 kind
 of
 shifted
 for
 a
 while


there
 cuz
 uh
 some
 people
 told
 him
 it
 was


too
 ambitious.
 And
 so
 it
 was
 make
 design


accessible
 is
 kind
 of
 where
 it
 went
 to.


But
 as
 we
 grow
 and
 as
 we
 continue
 to


evolve
 it,
 it
 always
 comes
 back
 to
 that


like
 how
 do
 you
 how
 can
 we
 get
 better
 at


as
 a
 tool
 helping
 to
 make
 eliminate
 that


gap
 um
 and
 make
 it
 so
 anybody
 can
 have


what
 they're
 they
 have
 ideas
 in
 their


head
 turn
 it
 into
 a
 product
 or
 turn
 it


into
 something
 that
 a's
 world
