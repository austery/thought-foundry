[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fan
 and
 today


I'm
 thrilled
 to
 be
 joined
 by
 Michael


mibach
 the
 CEO
 of
 MasterCard
 now


MasterCard
 is
 one
 of
 the
 largest


technology
 companies
 in
 the
 global


payment
 space
 and
 last
 year
 I
 think
 you


processed
 more
 than
 140
 billion


transactions
 totaling
 more
 than
 $9


trillion
 in
 famous
 volume
 wow
 we
 own


1.3%
 of
 the
 company
 totaling
 more
 than


$6
 billion
 so
 it's
 a
 pleasure
 to
 have


you
 here
 and
 I
 believe
 this
 is
 your


first
 ever
 podcast
 it
 is
 is
 the
 first


ever
 broadcast
 and
 it
 was
 150
 billion


transactions
 wow
 so
 even
 more
 so
 Michael


how
 do
 you
 see
 the
 whole
 payment
 space


developing
 over
 the
 next


decade
 right
 so
 the
 powerful
 trends
 at


work
 in
 payment
 um
 the
 first
 one
 to
 talk


about
 is
 now
 know
 as
 our
 lives
 are


digitizing
 is
 payments
 are
 becoming
 more


digital
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 payments


that
 happen
 in
 in
 cash
 um
 you
 look
 at


developing
 economies
 take
 Africa
 Asia
 uh


and
 so
 forth
 and
 you
 won't
 believe
 it


there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 checks
 around
 when


I
 moved
 to
 the
 United
 States
 you
 find
 a


lot
 of
 checks
 that's
 still
 also
 part
 of


the
 reality
 um
 then
 there's
 different


kinds
 of
 spaces
 as
 in
 personal
 payments


and
 business
 payments
 and
 personal


payments
 you
 know
 payments
 on
 the
 phone


Biometrics
 those
 things
 are
 becoming


very
 very
 common
 um
 if
 you
 go
 into
 a


store
 you
 just
 tap
 your
 card
 for
 example


you
 tap
 your
 phone
 that's
 also
 pretty


common
 that
 is
 not
 the
 reality
 in


commercial
 payments
 in
 commercial


payments
 things
 are
 a
 lot
 more
 clunky


and
 it's
 not
 as
 digitized
 and
 it's


intuitive


so
 with
 this
 is
 a
 landscape
 progressing


from
 different
 starting
 points


digitization
 friction
 lists
 all
 that


progresses
 quite
 dramatically
 technology


is
 there
 today
 to
 do
 that
 so
 that
 in
 10


years
 out
 from
 now
 uh
 biometric


authentication
 no
 more
 passwords
 you


basically
 recognize
 like
 your
 phone


recognizes
 you
 today
 when
 you
 open
 it


and
 the
 payment
 goes
 through
 so
 now
 um


you
 know
 before
 I
 came
 here
 I
 had
 a


slice
 of
 pizza
 down
 at
 the
 right
 Roma


Pizza
 pretty
 good
 yeah
 New
 York
 Pizza


yeah


um
 now
 10
 years
 time
 how
 will
 I
 pay
 for


that
 um
 most
 likely
 you
 will
 you
 have


possibly
 a
 personal
 device
 but
 it's
 not


a
 payment
 device
 it
 would
 just
 be
 your


phone
 or
 you
 don't
 even
 have
 um
 a
 device


you
 basically
 just
 look
 into
 some
 sort


of
 authentication
 camera
 or
 something


that
 uh
 the
 pizza
 dealer
 has
 where
 it


says
 okay
 it's
 Nicolai
 and
 it
 just
 go


through
 you
 pay
 authenticating
 with
 your


palm
 with
 your
 face
 with
 your
 eye
 that


is
 where
 I
 think
 things
 are
 going
 the


security
 is
 still
 there
 though
 in


background
 uh
 where
 it
 takes
 data
 that


you
 have
 permissioned
 as
 a
 consumer
 uh


to
 your
 bank
 for
 example
 and
 say
 I
 want


for
 security
 reasons
 I
 allow
 you
 to
 use


it
 and
 your
 facial
 data
 is
 then
 in
 the


transaction
 but
 it's
 all
 tokenized
 so


it's
 only
 used
 for
 this
 one
 transaction


at
 this
 one
 point
 so
 the
 personal
 data


doesn't
 fly
 around
 uh
 in
 the
 internet
 or


in
 government
 databases
 so
 so
 forth
 and


what's
 the
 role
 of
 MasterCard
 in
 this


world
 without
 cards
 right
 so
 what
 we
 do


is
 we
 enable
 the
 trend
 transactions


between
 different
 parties
 for
 example


you
 have
 a
 credit
 card
 today
 credit
 card


is
 issued
 by
 your
 bank
 um
 now
 the
 bank


and
 you
 you
 travel
 to
 New
 York
 and
 you


buy
 a
 slice
 of
 pizza
 with
 your
 Norwegian


um
 uh
 credit
 card
 who
 makes
 that
 all
 the


complexity
 in
 the
 middle
 work
 that
 is
 us


we
 connect
 the
 bank
 to
 another
 bank
 here


in
 the
 United
 States
 to
 the
 merchant
 and


circle
 closes
 it's
 pretty
 complex


process
 which
 we
 make
 very
 simple
 and
 it


happens
 in
 the
 background
 there's
 only


one
 of
 the
 many
 roles
 that
 we
 have
 we
 do


many
 other
 things
 we
 keep
 the


transaction
 safe
 we
 enable
 a
 transaction


let's
 say
 you
 have
 an
 airline
 card
 and


you
 have
 addon
 miles
 that
 you
 might
 get


um
 for
 that
 we
 facilitate
 those
 kind
 of


services
 that
 come
 uh
 come
 on
 top
 of


that
 that's
 on
 the
 personal
 payment
 side


take
 a
 small
 business
 a
 small
 business


needs
 working
 capital
 they
 want
 to
 get


paid
 faster
 so
 there's
 a
 set
 of
 Payment


Solutions
 card-based
 Payment
 Solutions


they
 get
 the
 small
 business
 their


payment
 much
 faster
 than
 they
 otherwise


would
 mhm
 so
 that
 helps
 those
 people


there
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 things
 that
 we
 do


across
 payments
 and
 payment
 related


Services
 what
 are
 digital
 currencies


going
 to
 mean
 for
 you
 digital
 currencies


you
 know
 the
 the
 power
 of
 digital


currencies
 lies
 in
 um
 the
 underlying


technology
 if
 you
 think
 blockchain
 for


example
 so
 if
 it's
 a
 blockchainbased


digital
 currency
 um
 there
 is
 in


something
 called
 programmability
 so
 if
 I


pay
 you
 today
 but
 we
 park
 the
 payment


here
 here
 in
 the
 middle
 and
 it's


programmable
 and
 says
 if
 these
 five


conditions
 are
 fulfilled
 only
 then
 will


the
 payment
 go
 to
 um
 to
 Nikolai
 that
 is


the
 kind
 of
 technology
 that
 blockchain


is
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 enabler
 to
 make


payments


smarter
 uh
 to
 facilitate
 easier


processes
 that
 don't
 have
 to
 happen
 in


the
 back
 back
 offices
 of
 a
 company
 to


check
 has
 this
 all
 been
 fulfilled
 you


can
 all
 program
 it
 and
 make
 it
 part
 of


the
 payment
 now
 there's
 other
 ideas


around
 digital
 currencies
 take
 the


digital
 Euro
 for
 example
 so
 here's
 uh
 uh


the
 European
 Central
 Bank
 that
 is
 um


advocating
 to
 have
 a
 digital
 Euro
 it's


basically
 central
 bank
 money
 in
 the


hands
 of
 European
 Union
 citizens
 and


euroland
 um
 different
 story
 that's
 an


alternative
 pay
 way
 to
 pay
 you
 could
 pay


with
 your
 Mastercard
 or
 you
 could
 pay


with
 your
 digital
 Euro
 we
 generally
 like


competition
 that's
 good
 we
 we
 have
 a


certain
 product
 this
 is
 another
 product


um
 it's
 not
 out
 there
 today
 you
 know


it's
 targeted
 to
 potentially
 pilot
 in


2026
 so
 it's
 an
 element
 of
 competition


is
 element
 of
 betterment
 that
 can
 come


out
 of
 this
 technology
 we're
 quite


heavily
 investing
 in
 it
 and
 crypto
 um


crypto
 you
 know
 today
 um
 do
 you


personally
 own
 cryptocurrencies
 I
 don't


no
 my
 my
 son
 has
 invested
 um
 I
 think


$100
 into
 blockchain
 he's
 very
 happy


today
 right
 he
 just
 called
 me
 the
 other


day
 and
 but
 where
 does
 it
 meet


MasterCard
 um
 it
 meets
 MasterCard
 as
 um


it's
 like
 any
 other
 good
 or
 service
 um


so
 what
 I
 mean
 with
 that
 is
 today
 you


can
 use
 your
 MasterCard
 to
 buy
 anything


that
 is
 legal
 so
 that's
 what
 we


facilitate
 over
 our
 Network
 now
 if
 you


wanted
 to
 buy
 cryptocurrency
 that's
 just


another
 good
 um
 so
 we
 enable
 the
 onramp


and
 the
 off
 rate
 uh
 offramp
 into
 a


cryptocurrency
 so
 if
 I
 want
 to


buy
 half
 a
 blockchain
 and
 you
 can
 do


that
 with
 your
 Master
 Card
 uh
 we


obviously
 vet
 those
 cryptocurrencies


compliance
 standards
 and
 things
 like


that
 but
 that's
 what
 we
 facilitate
 but


it's
 like
 buying
 anything
 else
 with
 your


master
 card
 as
 long
 as
 it's
 legal
 okay


what
 part
 of
 the
 whole
 big
 Tech
 fintech


mhm
 uh
 Innovation
 are
 you
 most
 worried


about
 what
 is
 it
 that
 what
 is
 the


biggest
 threat
 to
 your
 business
 so
 the


space
 of


fintech
 so
 let's
 just
 talk
 about
 uh
 you


know
 the
 landscape
 who's
 there
 there's


big
 Tech
 so
 take
 Apple
 for
 example


that's
 a
 you
 know
 fintech
 in
 in
 a
 way
 um


take


the
 startup
 space
 somebody
 who
 comes
 up


with
 a
 particular
 Tool
 uh
 that
 is
 part


of
 the
 broader
 Financial
 ecosystem
 and


somewhere
 in
 between
 you
 have
 the
 whole


category
 of
 Neo
 Banks
 pure
 you
 know


digital
 only
 banks
 that
 have
 just
 been


born
 um
 as
 a
 digital
 only
 bank
 that
 are


competing
 with
 existing
 Banks
 so
 that's


that's
 the
 broad
 range
 where
 we
 come


across
 them
 is
 really
 mostly
 as
 a
 growth


driver
 for
 the
 payment
 ecosystem


because
 fex
 the


startups
 the
 Neo
 Banks
 as
 well
 as
 big


Tech
 are
 enabling
 um
 digitized


transactions
 in
 part
 of
 the
 world
 that


were
 not
 digitized
 before
 and
 we
 you


know
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 1
 plus
 one
 is


three
 situation
 so
 I
 give
 you
 a
 very


specific


example
 um
 with
 apple
 um
 when
 the
 Apple


card
 launched
 and
 when
 Apple
 pay


launched
 the
 idea
 of
 tokenization
 was


born
 and
 we
 work
 together
 with
 apple
 to


tokenize
 card
 data


uh
 to
 ensure
 that
 payments
 are
 more
 safe


and
 more
 secure
 um
 that
 is
 now
 prevalent


around
 the
 world
 like
 we
 do
 1
 billion


transactions
 a
 month
 uh
 in
 tokenized


transactions
 a
 month
 so
 it's
 come
 from


an
 idea
 to
 something
 very
 significant


that
 drives
 more
 simple
 and
 more
 secure


payments
 there
 for
 digitization
 advances


that's
 something
 that
 that
 a
 company


like
 that
 can
 do
 on
 the
 startup
 side


what
 we're
 doing
 is
 we
 have
 uh
 one
 of


the
 largest
 fintech
 incubators
 that
 are


there
 so
 fintech
 come
 to
 us
 we
 help
 them


run
 their
 business
 because
 they
 have
 an


idea
 as
 an
 entrepreneur
 but
 they
 don't


really
 want
 to
 think
 about
 payments
 or


running
 a
 business
 they
 want
 to
 you
 know


turn
 their
 idea
 into
 reality
 um
 so
 we
 we


invite
 them
 into
 our
 start
 path


incubator
 and
 we
 work
 with
 them
 now
 the


question
 about
 competition
 and


threat
 and
 apple
 in
 theory
 could


decide
 uh
 because
 they're
 so
 large
 to
 do


payments
 themselves
 without
 us
 why


absolutely
 a
 possib


ability
 um
 the
 smaller
 ones
 they're


rather
 I
 think
 they're
 introducing
 new


capability
 entrepreneurial
 thinking


creativity
 um
 into
 the
 ecosystem
 that's


fundamentally
 not
 a
 competitive
 threat


at
 least
 an
 early
 stage
 but
 if
 they
 have


a
 dramatically
 new
 technology
 and
 idea


that
 we
 miss
 and
 that
 could
 be
 a
 problem


but
 that's
 medium
 to
 long
 term
 but
 we


engag
 them
 for
 exactly
 that
 reason
 so
 we


understand
 where's
 smart
 money
 going


where's
 new
 technology
 going
 and
 so


forth
 the
 larger
 ones
 that
 have
 a
 large


ecosystem
 taken
 taking
 Amazon
 taking


Apple
 and
 so
 for
 us
 the
 main
 thinking


that
 we
 have
 learned
 and
 appreciated


working
 with
 them
 is
 move
 fast
 they
 want


to
 move
 very
 fast
 um
 as
 a
 Global
 Network


as
 we
 are
 we've
 traditionally
 not
 moved


so
 fast
 because
 whatever
 we
 do
 has
 to


work
 for
 everybody
 in
 our
 Network
 that


is
 27,000
 banks
 around
 the
 world
 in
 220


countries
 in
 territories
 it
 has
 to
 work


for
 apple
 as
 well
 as
 the
 Commercial
 Bank


XY
 Z
 in
 an
 Asian
 country
 very
 different


approaches
 very
 different
 speed
 and
 so


forth
 they
 want
 to
 move
 fast
 so
 we


started
 to
 learn
 how
 we
 can
 get
 the


whole
 value
 chain
 and
 Master
 Card
 to


move
 equally
 fast
 over
 time
 we're
 not


quite
 there
 yet
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 progress
 if


we
 hold
 them
 back
 then
 the
 likelihood


increases
 that
 they're
 looking
 for


Alternatives
 MH
 but
 why
 don't
 they
 start


on
 their
 so
 far
 um
 if
 you
 look
 in


they've
 been
 a
 fantastic
 partner
 and
 we


have
 done
 um
 Apple
 Bay
 together
 we
 have


done
 tap
 on
 phone
 together
 uh
 we've
 done


a
 whole
 range
 of
 uh
 things
 together
 that


are
 in
 the
 existing
 ecosystem
 and
 not
 in


their
 own
 closed
 loop


environment
 and
 one
 of
 the
 main
 things


It's
 always
 important
 to
 understand
 what


is
 your
 partner
 your
 strategic
 partner


actually
 trying
 to
 do
 what
 they're


trying
 what
 we
 see
 they're
 trying
 to
 do


is
 this
 is
 a
 fantastic
 user
 experience


and
 have
 the
 user
 use
 that
 as
 long
 as


our
 Solutions
 facilitate
 that
 within
 the


phone
 within
 the
 iPhone
 for
 example
 now


that
 works
 take
 Amazon
 you
 have
 you
 know


oneclick
 experience
 um
 in
 the


marketplace
 for
 the
 longest
 time
 if


payments
 start
 to
 add
 five
 clicks


because
 they're
 just
 full
 of
 friction


that's
 a
 problem
 we've
 invested
 as
 a


company
 in
 frictionless
 security
 that


happens
 in
 the
 background
 and
 it
 is
 not


onetime
 passwords
 and
 so
 forth
 we've


just
 announced
 that
 by
 2030
 um
 we
 will


um
 have
 no
 more
 onetime
 passwords
 no


more
 passwords
 it's
 all
 going
 to
 be


authentic
 biomatic
 authenticated


payments
 are
 you
 with
 your
 face
 by
 2030


and
 we're
 pushing
 the
 industry
 because


we
 have
 a
 broader
 Network
 we
 can
 take


Everybody
 by
 the
 hand
 and
 say
 we
 give


you
 DEC
 some
 you
 know
 six
 years
 to


figure
 it
 out
 to
 get
 there
 to
 advance
 to


the
 next
 stage
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 to


worry
 about
 these


things
 large
 players
 like
 that
 if
 the


industry
 doesn't
 move
 and
 it's
 a
 bad


user


experience
 I
 think
 they
 might
 have


enough
 motivation
 to
 do
 their
 own
 thing


but
 that's
 exactly
 what
 we
 learned
 it's


why
 we
 love
 those
 Partnerships
 Okay
 so


you
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 threat
 in
 the


short
 term
 no
 what
 do
 you
 make
 of
 the


buy
 now
 pay
 later
 companies
 I
 see
 clar


eyes
 is
 Now
 list
 nework
 yeah
 IPO
 plans


uh
 for
 the
 US
 have
 been
 registered
 and


so
 forth
 you
 know
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 is


um
 is
 an
 interesting
 phenomenon
 for
 many


reasons
 uh
 positive
 um
 there
 might
 be


people
 that
 might
 never
 use
 a
 card
 in


their
 life
 it's
 just
 not
 how
 they
 grew


up
 you
 know
 young
 people
 um
 and
 uh
 this


buy
 now
 payat
 idea
 you
 take
 a
 loan
 for


for
 one
 particular
 use
 uh
 that's
 good


could
 be
 interesting
 from
 a
 uh
 from
 a


borrowing
 perspectiv
 because
 you


actually
 need
 the
 credit
 so
 for
 all


sorts
 of
 reasons
 it's
 relevant
 um
 we


looked
 at
 this
 when
 this
 first
 came
 up


about
 two
 two
 three
 years
 ago
 this
 is


when
 the
 TR
 Trend
 really
 kicked
 in
 with


Clara
 with
 the
 firm
 with


afterpay
 and
 uh
 we
 looked
 at
 these


business
 models
 and
 we
 talk
 started
 to


talk
 to
 our
 customers
 uh
 for
 example
 the


banks
 and
 the
 banks
 are
 saying
 you
 know


this
 is
 an
 interesting
 way
 to
 uh
 if
 we


were
 to
 um
 build
 out
 our
 loan
 portfolio


through
 um
 transaction
 tied
 lending
 then


our
 cost
 of
 acquisition
 is
 much
 lower


because
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 find
 all
 these


customer
 through
 a
 branch
 or
 another
 way


to
 take
 a
 personal
 loan
 from
 us
 it


actually
 happens
 through
 the
 transaction


so
 makes
 sense
 from
 A
 bank's
 perspective


so
 there
 was
 interest
 and
 we
 said
 well


great
 um
 how
 does
 Clara
 how
 do
 a
 firm
 uh


grow
 their
 business
 they
 go
 to
 large


merchants
 and
 they
 offer
 this
 capability


it's
 a
 very
 good
 user
 experience


meanwhile
 it
 wasn't
 initially
 but
 it's


meanwhile
 and
 we
 said
 what
 can
 we
 solve


that
 isn't
 solved
 in
 this
 and
 what
 we


can
 solve
 is
 scaling
 this
 up
 if
 you


deliver
 this
 capability
 through
 the


MasterCard
 Network
 to
 any
 Merchant


around
 the
 world
 and
 you
 have
 a
 bank
 any


Bank
 on
 the
 other
 end
 of
 the
 transaction


that
 really
 drives
 scalability
 is


exactly
 what
 we've
 done
 so
 we
 took
 this


to
 uh
 MasterCard
 installments
 to
 Market


I
 think
 last
 year
 and
 said
 wherever


Master
 Card
 is
 available
 if
 you
 want
 uh


pay
 byy
 now
 pay
 later
 you
 can
 take
 it


and
 uh
 ever
 since
 the
 question
 that
 we


got
 from
 investors
 was
 you
 know
 isn't


this
 the
 end
 of
 MasterCard
 we
 said
 well


we
 always
 consider
 that
 um
 but
 here's


here's
 an
 answer
 and
 that
 is
 we
 just


make
 it
 available
 through
 the
 network


because
 the
 network
 can
 deliver
 any


functionality
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 put
 in


so
 it
 lives
 alongside
 the
 claras
 of
 this


world
 in
 the
 payment
 space
 where
 is


Europe
 compared
 to
 the


US
 so
 uh


um
 few
 things
 to
 say
 when
 I
 look
 preco


pre
 pandemic
 the
 digitization
 rate
 of


particularly
 Continental
 Europe
 was


behind
 the
 United
 States
 UK
 was
 a
 bit


different
 at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 still
 part


of
 uh
 the
 EU
 we
 uh
 saw
 fintech


Innovation
 I
 think
 uh
 across
 the
 pond


and
 in
 in
 similar
 ways
 um
 but
 overall
 uh


use
 of
 cash
 was
 higher
 uh
 use
 of
 cash
 in


the
 United
 States
 use
 of
 cash
 is
 still


higher
 in
 the
 United
 States
 than
 in


Europe
 uh
 but
 Europe
 has
 dramatically


caught
 up
 so
 if
 you
 look
 today
 uh
 take


my
 home
 country
 in
 Germany
 there
 is
 a


lot
 more
 digitization
 that
 was
 there


three
 three
 four
 years
 ago
 so
 catching


up
 so
 that's
 one
 distinction
 the
 other


distinction
 is
 the
 versatility
 the
 range


of
 choices
 and
 payments
 in
 Europe
 is
 is


higher
 uh
 than
 it
 is
 here
 in
 the
 United


States
 um
 you
 have
 options
 go
 go
 to


Denmark
 you
 can
 pay
 pay
 with
 Mobile
 Pay


Anywhere
 uh
 QR
 code
 and
 you
 pay
 my


daughter
 lives
 in
 Copenhagen
 so
 uh


whenever
 I
 go
 there
 I
 have
 a
 problem


because
 as
 a
 visitor
 it
 actually
 doesn't


work
 for
 a
 tourist
 City
 like
 Copenhagen


I
 think
 there's
 an
 issue
 that
 it
 somehow


should
 be
 addressed
 so
 I
 think
 we
 should


lean
 in
 on
 that
 there
 is
 um
 take
 uh
 go


to
 Poland
 take
 Blick
 or
 bizom
 in
 Spain


is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 mobile
 pay
 the


mobile
 B
 based
 uh
 payment
 Solutions
 um


you
 have
 various
 local
 um
 equivalents
 of


MasterCard
 gyro
 and
 and
 so
 forth


different
 card
 propositions
 that
 exist


but
 they
 generally
 only
 work
 in
 the


respective
 country
 despite
 the
 fact
 it's


the
 EU
 but
 then
 it
 works
 in
 the


Netherlands
 only
 or
 Works
 in
 Spain
 only


um
 you
 have


um
 obviously
 you
 have
 MasterCard
 and
 uh


you
 know
 Visa
 available
 in
 American


Express
 so
 greater
 versatility
 I
 was


recently
 um
 in
 Brussels
 talking
 to
 the


respective
 commissioner
 and
 uh
 the


question
 that
 set
 of
 the
 meeting
 was


exactly
 your
 question
 how
 do
 you
 compare


uh
 Europe
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 um


and
 I
 said
 well
 there
 is
 the
 most
 choice


to
 the
 European
 consumer
 available
 for


us
 it
 means
 a
 number
 of
 things
 it
 means


that
 in


Europe
 every
 capability
 that
 we
 have
 as


a
 company
 and
 where
 we
 develop
 we
 need


to
 um
 keep
 Europe
 in
 mind
 because


there's
 more
 choice
 so
 we
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 our
 solution
 is
 as


differentiated
 as
 possible
 and
 really


gives
 the
 consumer
 in
 that
 array
 of


choice
 the
 best
 reason
 to
 use
 our


payment
 uh
 Solution
 that's
 the
 consumer


as
 well
 as
 the
 customer
 which
 is
 often


time
 the
 bank
 so
 more
 diversity
 um
 uh
 in


Choice
 um
 but
 more
 opportunity
 continue


to
 digitize
 I
 think
 is
 probably
 the
 the


net
 answer
 of
 uh
 to
 your
 question
 rest


of
 the
 world
 so
 Asia


um
 Africa
 China
 what
 are
 the
 main
 TR
 you


know
 let's
 if
 we
 take
 that
 landscape
 uh


it's
 uh
 it's
 interesting
 uh
 it
 really


comes
 down
 to
 the
 question
 of
 how
 does
 a


market
 grow
 up
 in
 payments
 if
 you
 take


China
 so
 in
 China
 what
 you
 see
 is
 um
 so


like
 in
 Europe
 um
 if
 you're
 in
 Oslo
 you


probably
 tap
 a
 card
 or
 use
 a
 phone
 uh


what
 you
 do
 in
 China
 is
 you
 scan
 a
 QR


code
 entirely
 different
 um
 this
 is
 has


really
 not
 scaled
 anywhere
 else
 in
 the


world
 like
 that
 we
 chat
 alipay
 you
 see


alipe
 maybe
 in
 Europe
 at
 uh
 some


airports
 uh
 where
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


Chinese
 uh
 consumers
 traveling
 through


um
 why
 is


that
 because
 it's
 was
 it
 was
 and


continues
 to
 be
 a
 protected
 environment


so
 it
 grows
 just
 grows
 up
 differently


it's
 like
 the
 biosphere
 of
 Australia


looks
 entirely
 different
 like
 you
 know


the
 rest
 of
 Asia
 so
 it's
 the
 same
 it's


the
 same
 for
 payment
 if
 if
 you
 want
 to


compare
 it
 like
 that
 um
 in
 Africa
 yet


again
 a
 different
 starting
 point
 it's


also
 where
 in
 time
 are
 you
 um
 you
 have
 a


highly
 digitized
 Market
 in
 in
 in
 China


in
 Africa
 it's
 not
 highly
 digitized
 yet


it's
 mainly
 because
 of
 infrastructure


reasons
 and
 you
 know
 economic
 reasons


but
 now
 it's
 starting
 to
 accelerate


quite
 significantly
 and
 it
 takes
 yet


again
 a
 different
 route
 it
 doesn't
 take


the
 route
 uh
 of
 Legacy
 technology
 sleep


frogging
 and
 is
 going
 straight
 to
 mobile


based
 uh
 financial
 services
 and
 this


isn't
 the
 same
 mobile
 based
 Financial


Services
 I
 touched
 on
 earlier
 like
 just


a
 mobile
 based
 payment
 is
 everything
 is


on
 the
 phone
 and
 everything
 is
 on
 a


phone
 like
 this
 but
 also
 a
 really
 basic


feature
 phone
 um
 so
 mobile
 based


Financial
 servic
 is
 the
 path
 that
 Africa


takes
 um
 and
 that
 includes


payments
 and
 what
 do
 we
 know
 about
 that


not
 much
 I
 worked
 in
 Africa
 for
 for
 10


years
 and
 um
 I
 learned
 you
 got
 to
 have


the
 locally
 relevant
 solution
 so
 what
 we


decided
 to
 do
 is
 we
 obviously
 offer
 our


standard
 solution


U
 but
 we
 in
 invested
 in
 Partnerships
 so


we're
 partnering
 with
 the
 large
 Telos
 we


just
 announced
 uh
 was
 uh
 earlier
 this


year
 a
 $200
 million
 investment
 MTN
 which


is
 the
 largest
 telecommunications
 mobile


provider
 in
 Africa
 uh
 to
 deliver
 to
 spin


off
 um
 a
 mobile
 based
 Financial
 Services


business
 to
 drive
 solutions
 to
 consumers


in
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 continents
 saving


paying
 uh
 being
 paid
 as
 a
 small
 business


transferring
 money
 in
 out
 getting


remittances
 from
 your
 relatives
 in


Europe
 Etc
 the
 whole
 range
 so
 those
 are


some
 some
 examples
 on
 how
 the
 world


looks
 very
 different
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at


um
 your
 strategy
 going
 forward
 how


important
 are
 these


Acquisitions
 and
 what
 are
 the
 type
 of


things
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 so
 we
 um
 you
 know


we're
 very
 clear
 when
 it
 comes
 to


Acquisitions
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 so
 it


always
 starts
 with
 the
 strategy
 obvious


thing
 to
 say
 but
 it
 does
 start
 with
 the


strategy
 okay
 what
 what
 do
 we
 want
 to
 do


we
 want
 to
 do
 a
 CLE
 things
 we
 want
 to


have
 the
 full
 range
 of
 Payment
 Solutions


and
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a
 range
 of
 services


that
 differentiate
 our
 Payment
 Solutions


either
 make
 them
 safer
 or
 smarter
 that's


broadly
 speaking
 our
 strategy
 um
 so
 we


look
 to
 um
 buy
 assets
 that
 we're
 not


fast
 enough
 or
 good
 enough
 in
 building


ourselves
 either
 in
 the
 payment
 solution


side
 or
 on
 the
 payment
 related
 services


and
 where
 we
 then
 look
 is
 to
 say
 okay
 I


can't
 build
 it
 fast
 enough
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 start
 to
 look
 outside
 and
 the


very
 specific
 areas
 that
 we
 have
 just


highlighted
 yesterday
 at
 our
 investor


day
 uh
 that
 we
 had
 here
 in
 New
 York
 we


said
 we're
 looking
 in
 cyber
 security


we're
 going
 to
 look
 forward
 and
 say


where's
 the
 next
 threats
 where
 are
 the


next
 threats
 coming
 from
 and
 do
 we
 have


the
 right
 kind
 of
 assets
 can
 we
 build


them
 ourselves
 in
 a
 time
 of
 a
 very
 fast


moving
 cycle
 where
 the
 frosters
 coming


up
 with
 new
 taals
 they're
 using
 AI


they're
 using
 generative
 AI
 so
 we
 can't


be
 building
 something
 that
 takes
 a
 year


to
 build
 there's
 a
 company
 out
 there


that
 already
 has
 that
 we
 have
 just


announced
 the
 plan
 the
 plan
 not
 yet


approved
 acquisition
 of
 the
 world's


number
 one
 threat
 intelligence
 company


recorded
 future
 that
 was
 a
 good
 example


everybody
 needs
 threat
 intelligence
 is


where
 is
 my
 next
 cyber
 security
 threat


coming
 from
 and
 we
 want
 to
 buy
 them


where
 else
 are
 we
 looking
 we're
 looking


in
 the
 the
 space
 of
 commercial
 payments


the
 outside
 of
 our
 conversation
 I
 said


commercial
 these
 payments
 are
 clunky


they're
 not
 yet
 as
 digitized
 so
 we're


looking
 for
 assets
 and
 players
 that
 make


this
 space
 a
 lot
 easier
 you
 you
 touched


on
 some
 of
 these


kind
 of
 uh
 activities
 which
 are
 outs


outside
 the
 core
 payments
 then
 you
 do


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 outside
 core


payments
 right
 yes
 um
 in
 your
 mind
 one


of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 that
 you


offer
 clients
 right
 so
 um
 just
 put
 it
 in


the
 context
 of
 the
 numbers
 when
 you
 say


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 what
 this
 means
 is


for
 us
 today
 U
 core
 payments
 is
 about


60%
 of
 our
 Revenue
 yeah
 and
 40%
 of
 our


revenue
 is
 related
 to
 payments
 related


services
 and
 they're
 really
 in
 two


categories
 make
 the
 payment
 safer
 cyber


security
 related
 ated
 trans
 uh
 services


for
 example
 what
 is
 that
 it
 is
 at
 the


moment
 of
 the
 transaction
 ensuring
 that


this
 transaction
 is
 the
 one
 that
 should


go
 through
 and
 it's
 not
 fraudulent
 so


you
 fraud
 score
 it
 say
 is
 there
 a


digital
 identity
 that
 it's
 it's
 from


Nikolai
 or
 that
 is
 going
 to
 Michael
 is


it
 used
 on
 a
 device
 that
 you
 have
 you


been
 used
 before
 is
 the
 geolocation
 data


telling
 you
 whether
 you
 actually
 can
 be


in
 this
 place
 right
 now
 and
 all
 of
 that


fraud
 scoring
 one
 example
 just
 a
 bit


more
 that
 so
 fraud
 uh
 nearly
 $500


billion
 a
 year
 in
 right
 Global
 losses
 MH


how
 are
 you
 helping
 to
 reduce
 that
 so


this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 particularly
 important


part
 uh
 of
 uh
 of
 our
 business
 um
 we
 have


invested
 8
 billion
 dollar
 in
 the
 last


five
 years
 into
 cyber
 security


capability
 um
 and
 fraud
 is
 the
 core
 part


of
 that
 if
 we
 look
 at
 what
 fraud
 does
 uh


to
 Consumers
 um
 in
 a
 in
 a
 rapidly


digitizing
 World
 once
 you
 frauded
 you


lose
 trust
 in
 digital
 Solutions
 you


won't
 really
 participate
 in
 the
 same
 way


if
 you're
 small
 businesses
 can
 be


existential
 to
 you
 so
 there's
 obvious


you
 know
 there
 a
 whole
 range
 of
 reason


why
 this
 is


devastating
 um
 it's
 rising
 um
 now
 we


have
 a
 really
 preferred
 position
 because


every
 value
 exchange
 that
 takes
 place
 in


a
 digital
 fashion
 we
 have
 an
 opportunity


to
 put
 on
 a
 stop
 to
 what
 the
 frauders


are
 doing
 building
 the
 tools
 said
 during


the
 transaction
 before
 digital
 identity


Solutions
 is
 the
 person
 that's
 even


attempting
 the
 transaction
 can
 we
 know


it
 is
 with
 99%
 shity
 it
 is
 you
 or
 me
 are


the
 frost
 just
 moving
 faster
 than
 you
 um


we
 invest
 so
 much
 money
 $8
 billion
 to


stay
 that
 one
 step
 ahead
 and
 so
 far
 so


good
 and
 AI
 will
 change
 this
 in
 what
 way


um
 AI
 is
 enabling
 um
 frosters


to


um
 you
 pull
 in
 additional
 data
 to
 find


out
 where
 is
 the
 most
 vulnerable
 Target


that
 I
 can
 find
 that
 is
 one
 thing
 that
 a


AI
 or
 generative
 AI
 can
 do
 four
 of
 fraud


to
 say
 all
 right
 I
 pull
 in
 all
 the
 data


suck
 it
 up
 and
 say
 all
 right
 here's
 a


set
 of
 transactions
 that
 are
 easier
 to


go
 to
 than
 others
 we
 can
 do
 the
 exact


same
 thing
 now
 it's
 important
 to
 know


that
 um
 for
 our
 business
 we've
 been


investing
 in
 in
 AI
 for
 the
 last
 decade


uh
 we
 have
 been
 investing
 in
 generative


AI
 for
 the
 last
 three
 years
 or
 so
 um


what
 we
 do
 for
 example
 is
 um
 uh
 today


with
 the
 help
 of
 generative
 AI
 we're
 not


only
 fraud
 scoring
 an
 existing


transaction
 we're
 able
 to


predict
 in
 the
 same
 fashion
 that
 I
 just


described
 what
 a
 fraud
 St
 might
 do
 we


predict
 what
 is
 the
 next
 likely


fraudulent
 transaction
 that's
 coming


because
 you
 start
 to
 see
 there
 is
 out
 in


the
 in
 the
 data
 Lake
 that's
 out
 there


you
 can
 start
 to
 see
 there's


indications
 discard
 might
 be
 bef
 Fred


because
 it's
 been
 been
 using
 in


vulnerable
 places
 um
 etc
 etc
 many


indicators
 as
 such
 so
 um
 everybody
 is


arming
 up
 and
 we
 will
 arm
 up
 faster
 and


because
 we
 have
 this
 network
 position


with
 our
 customers
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


Partners
 in
 the
 payment
 space
 But
 even


now
 beyond
 the
 payment
 space
 who
 lean
 on


us
 and
 say
 as
 a
 network
 you
 have
 more


data
 than
 anybody
 you
 need
 to
 help
 us


this
 includes
 governments
 when
 you
 look


at
 when
 you
 look
 at
 all
 your
 data
 and


data
 set
 I
 mean
 nobody's
 got
 more
 than


you
 anyway
 any
 anything
 fun
 you
 can
 read


out
 of
 these
 data
 sets
 what
 are
 some
 of


the
 kind
 of
 strange
 I
 tell
 I'll
 tell
 you


fun
 it's
 just
 stick
 with
 uh
 with


artificial
 intelligence
 um
 the
 um
 so


somewhere
 I
 give
 you
 two
 example
 um
 the


first
 is
 somewhere
 between
 fun
 and
 uh


and
 less
 annoyance
 um
 is
 you
 book
 a
 trip


you
 to
 go
 away
 for
 the
 weekend
 um
 and


what
 do
 you
 do
 today
 at
 least
 that's


what
 I
 do
 today
 so
 talk
 to
 my
 wife
 we


decide
 we
 want
 to
 go
 away
 for
 the


weekend
 you
 look
 on
 Google
 about
 the


destination
 you
 find
 about
 the


restaurants
 you
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 what


is
 the
 trans
 what's
 the
 transfer
 time


from
 the
 airport
 which
 airline
 Etc
 and


your
 Sunday
 is
 gone
 but
 then
 you
 have
 a


pretty
 decent
 trip
 uh
 but
 the
 Sunday
 is


gone
 today
 you
 can
 do
 this
 in
 uh
 you


know
 minutes
 provision
 data
 where
 I


would
 make
 available
 as
 a
 consumer


access
 to
 my
 loyalty
 accounts
 um
 so
 it's


clear
 which
 miles
 can
 be
 Ed
 to
 book
 the


trip
 um
 there's
 is
 obviously
 public
 data


what
 restaurant
 is
 good
 open
 data
 open


table
 at
 credentials
 for
 Access
 for


reserving
 at
 the
 restaurant
 Etc
 all
 of


this
 data
 is
 there
 the
 manual
 thing
 that


I
 do
 it
 can
 all
 be
 automated
 so
 we
 put


out
 shopping
 assistance
 now
 where
 we


pull
 of
 this
 together
 and
 say
 the
 data


is
 there
 we
 are
 we're
 playing
 in


payments
 we're
 playing
 in
 loyalty
 and
 so


forth
 so
 we
 have
 actually
 a
 preferred
 uh


position
 to
 make
 this
 a
 lot
 easier
 the


trip
 will
 be
 fun
 but
 it's
 less
 annoyance


in
 preparing
 it
 what
 is
 even
 more
 fun
 is


shopping
 assistance


so
 let's
 say
 uh
 you
 have
 been
 invited
 to


a
 wedding
 a
 wedding
 is
 in
 Bali
 and
 uh


the
 organizers
 your
 friends
 are
 saying


the
 theme
 is
 white
 so
 you
 need
 a
 white


suit
 for
 a
 wedding
 in
 barley
 um
 needs
 to


be
 linen
 because
 it's
 super
 hot
 there


and
 so
 forth
 how
 do
 you
 even
 buy
 that


shopping
 assistance
 I
 need
 a
 a
 linen


suit
 for
 a
 beach
 wedding
 in
 Bali
 uh


natural
 language
 engagement
 and
 then
 you


do
 this
 uh
 behind
 the
 scenes
 the
 product


choices
 come
 up
 was
 it
 AI
 who
 bought
 who


bought
 your
 current
 suits
 here
 um
 no


actually
 no
 that
 was
 just
 me
 uh
 going
 to


a
 actual
 physical


shop
 I
 like
 I
 like
 Mich
 you
 so
 Michael


you
 are
 so


yesterday
 um
 well
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 In


Pockets
 I
 try
 to
 be
 but
 I
 I
 the
 last


thing
 I
 want
 to
 say
 on
 this
 this
 is


actually
 I'm
 not
 making
 this
 out
 it's


live
 it's
 live
 Michael
 Cores
 uh
 we
 just


put
 it
 out
 in
 uh
 uh
 into
 the
 market
 um


as
 as
 a
 first
 test
 and
 now
 believe
 the


world
 the
 future
 of
 a
 world
 of
 a
 lot
 of


assistance
 that
 consumers
 can
 easily
 use


is
 going
 to
 be
 powerful
 if
 we
 um
 change


t
 a
 bit
 here
 um
 how
 do
 you
 define
 good


leadership
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 comes
 to


mind
 is
 you
 got
 to
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a


vision
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go
 set
 a
 Clear


Vision
 you
 set
 the
 vision
 yourself
 what


you
 do
 with
 your
 team
 or
 how
 do
 you
 get


to
 the
 vision
 um
 yeah
 with
 the
 team
 of


course
 um
 but
 you
 know
 as
 a
 leader
 I


think
 having
 a
 fundamental
 idea
 what
 you


want
 to
 do
 and
 then
 start
 to
 iterate


around
 that
 with
 kind
 of
 the
 best
 and


brightest
 Minds
 around
 it
 including


people
 who
 actually
 challenge
 you
 uh


challenge
 the
 vision
 um
 I
 think
 is


important
 so
 Clear
 Vision
 is
 the
 first


one
 I
 think
 um


the
 back
 to
 this
 question
 about
 how
 you


said
 it
 which
 which
 is
 a
 great
 question


is
 as
 a
 leader
 to
 ensure
 in
 a
 fast


changing
 world
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure


points
 you
 know
 technology
 uh
 is


changing
 at
 a
 rapid
 space
 we
 we've
 seen


more
 change
 than
 ever
 before
 to
 have
 the


right
 kind
 of
 team
 around
 the
 table
 that


Challen
 permanently
 challenges
 in
 h


Hon's
 division
 really


important
 when
 um
 I
 believe
 you
 talked


to
 a
 um
 banga
 before
 um
 when
 we
 did
 our


leadership
 transition
 here
 at


MasterCard
 we
 announced
 the
 leadership


change
 in
 FY
 just
 for
 the
 for
 the


listeners
 a
 banga
 was
 your
 predecessor


yes
 who's
 now
 heading
 up
 the
 World
 Bank


he's
 now
 heading
 the
 World
 Bank
 we


announced
 the
 leadership
 transition
 on


the
 25th
 of
 February
 2020
 this
 was
 two


weeks
 before
 the
 United
 States
 States


went
 into
 Co
 lockdown
 as
 a
 result
 of


which
 um
 a
 month
 later
 our
 Revenue
 fell


off
 a
 cliff
 because
 nobody
 went
 to
 a


store
 any
 longer
 to
 pay
 MH
 now
 back
 to


the
 vision
 the
 vision
 of
 the
 vision
 and


the
 business
 model
 was
 clear
 but
 it
 was


significantly
 impaired
 for
 a
 period
 of


time
 and
 we
 needed
 a
 team
 around
 the
 TA


table
 that


was
 empowered
 was
 willing
 to
 speak
 up


but
 was
 all
 starting
 with
 everybody


including
 me
 accepting
 we
 don't
 have
 the


answers
 there
 is
 no
 playbook
 for
 a


pandemic
 and
 we
 can't
 really
 reach
 in


the
 shelf
 and
 say
 okay
 this
 is
 how
 we
 do


this
 so
 creating
 a
 an
 atmosphere
 of


psychological
 safety
 and
 ability
 for


everybody
 to
 speak
 up
 even
 if
 you
 don't


have
 the
 answer
 in
 today's
 business


world
 that
 know
 might
 be
 common
 but
 I
 I


felt
 this
 was
 important
 to
 really
 put


that
 down
 um
 and
 with
 the
 employees
 to


step
 forward
 um
 with
 humbleness
 and
 say


to
 our
 employees
 we
 don't
 know
 but
 we'll


figure
 it
 out
 together
 do
 you
 have
 some


leadership
 principles
 that
 you
 follow
 as


a
 as
 a
 company
 um
 we
 felt
 we
 need


to
 double
 down
 on
 exactly
 that
 um
 so


what
 we
 uh
 did
 is
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 we


said
 here's
 the
 kind
 of
 behaviors
 that


we
 want
 to
 see
 at
 Master
 move
 fast
 grow


together
 create
 value
 very
 simple


English
 that's
 what
 we
 said
 uh
 is
 that
 a


leadership
 principle
 I'm
 not
 sure
 but


it's
 the
 kind
 of
 behaviors
 that
 we
 want


to
 see
 and
 we
 want
 to
 reward
 at


MasterCard
 um
 I
 think
 broader
 leadership


principles
 as
 you
 talk
 about
 it
 decency


doing
 the
 right
 thing
 um
 that's


something
 that's
 pretty
 deeply
 um
 even


you
 know
 from
 the
 days
 that
 AJ
 was
 the


CEO
 here
 deeply
 ingrained
 in
 kind
 of
 the


the
 veins
 of
 the


company


um
 I
 think
 that's
 been
 a
 pretty
 guiding


principle
 for
 us
 so
 anything
 from
 your


from
 your
 private
 life
 or
 circumstances


which
 you
 take
 with
 you
 into
 your


leadership
 right
 um
 yes
 um
 I
 was
 13
 so


this
 takes
 you
 long
 back
 when
 uh
 uh
 my


parents
 said
 to
 me


um
 asked
 me
 if
 I
 would
 like
 to
 be
 an


exchange


student
 um
 my
 father
 used
 to
 be
 one
 of


the
 first
 exchange
 students
 from
 Germany


to
 the
 United
 States
 back
 in
 the
 early


60s
 and
 um
 he
 loved
 it
 and
 they
 just


asked
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 it
 and
 at
 the


age
 of
 14
 uh
 15
 actually
 I
 I
 went
 to
 the


United
 States
 to
 do
 my
 senior
 high


school
 year
 why
 is
 this
 forming


irrelevant
 because
 of
 the
 following


reasons
 the
 family
 uh
 that
 uh
 had
 made


the
 decision
 to
 take
 an
 exchange
 student


living
 in
 Michigan
 middle
 of
 the
 country


and
 uh
 was
 um
 you
 know
 lovely
 amazing


courageous
 decision
 really
 didn't
 travel


anywhere
 before
 had
 some
 relatives
 in


Florida
 otherwise
 really
 no
 passport
 not


leaving
 uh
 not
 leaving
 the


country
 um
 and
 suddenly
 there's
 this


Foreigner
 at
 the
 table
 and
 what
 turned


out
 what
 I
 didn't
 know
 is
 they
 were
 also


really
 struggling
 to
 make
 ends
 meet


financially
 so
 growing
 up
 in
 middle


class
 in
 Europe
 where
 everything
 just


works
 and
 we
 never
 really
 had
 to
 worry


about
 it
 to
 a
 scenario
 where
 all


everything
 I
 took
 for
 granted
 wasn't


there
 any
 longer
 to
 be
 taken
 for
 granted


dramatic
 change
 uh
 in
 perception
 and


just
 relooking
 at
 uh
 at
 life
 and
 just


not
 taking
 things
 for
 granted
 uh
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 the
 conclusion
 the
 fact


that
 we
 sit
 here
 today
 if
 I
 hadn't


actually
 gone
 out
 I
 might
 be
 just


working
 in
 Germany
 today
 and
 do


something
 entirely
 different
 than
 what
 I


do
 today
 I'm
 not
 judging
 it
 one
 is


better
 or
 the
 other
 so
 that
 that's
 one


experience
 the
 other
 experience
 is
 um
 I


worked
 close
 to
 uh
 10
 years
 in
 Middle


East
 and
 Africa
 and
 it's
 the
 same
 thing


the
 same
 thing
 came
 I
 had
 a
 concept
 of


working
 in
 Investment
 Banking
 and


corporate
 banking
 in
 Europe
 um
 and
 I


came
 to
 Africa
 and
 none
 of
 what
 I


knew
 made
 sense
 or
 worked
 or
 was
 a
 rule


because
 there
 was
 no
 infrastructure
 all


the
 rules
 were
 off
 it
 was
 just
 a


different
 approach
 do
 you
 have
 a
 German


leadership
 style
 you
 think
 is
 such
 a


thing
 as
 a
 German
 leadership
 style
 I
 uh


don't
 think
 so
 uh
 no
 you
 don't
 think
 you


have
 it
 or
 you
 don't
 think
 there
 is
 I


don't
 think
 there
 is
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what


that
 would
 I'd
 be
 curious
 what
 you
 think


about
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty


systematic
 it's
 very
 systematic
 it's


very
 orong
 it's
 quite
 there's
 more
 heroy


in
 Germany
 than
 in
 many
 other
 countries


I
 think
 it
 might
 be
 uh
 it
 might
 be
 very


cliche
 or
 one
 can
 never
 generalizes
 um


but
 I'm
 certainly
 not
 uh
 a
 great
 friend


of
 hierarchy
 um
 because
 in
 the
 end
 you


know
 when
 I
 look
 for
 input
 clich
 is


unknown
 there
 for
 a
 reason
 uh
 that's


true
 that's
 true
 but
 you
 know
 overall
 I


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 actually
 the


reality
 maybe
 I
 I
 know
 a
 subset
 of


people
 um
 personally
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 um
 when
 when
 I
 look
 for
 input


uh
 when
 I
 look
 for
 input
 what
 you
 know


where
 we
 might
 go
 uh
 obviously
 I
 talk
 to


my
 team
 and
 I
 talk
 to
 our
 experts
 and


all
 of
 that
 uh
 but
 I
 hang
 out
 with
 some


of
 our
 youngsters
 that
 we
 have
 just
 uh


hired
 this
 office
 here
 in
 particular
 in


which
 we
 are
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 product
 uh


and
 Innovation
 focused
 people
 a
 lot
 of


folks
 who
 work
 in
 our
 technology


function
 here
 in
 this
 in
 this
 office
 in


Manhattan
 and
 wander
 the
 floors
 and
 sit


down
 with
 them
 and
 and
 ask
 them
 what
 do


you
 think
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 if
 you're


hierarchy
 oriented
 you
 would
 work


through
 your
 team
 and
 say
 okay
 give
 give


me
 all
 the
 input
 I
 got
 a
 very
 different


uh
 conversation
 going
 do
 you
 ever
 get


angry
 um
 no
 not
 really
 ever
 afraid
 uh


yes
 yes
 so
 I'm
 afraid
 of
 I'm
 afraid
 of


heights


are
 what
 about
 you
 think
 you
 but
 you
 are


you
 so
 high
 up
 in
 the
 organization
 now


that
 that
 makes
 you
 worried
 it
 is
 uh


it's
 very
 specific
 I
 love
 the
 mountains


I
 hike
 um
 and
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 work
 and


challenges
 and
 so
 on
 does
 that
 make
 you


afraid
 no
 what's
 the
 MasterCard
 culture


is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 the
 MasterCard


culture
 yes
 it's
 come
 back
 to
 you
 know


those
 you
 asked
 about
 leadership


principles
 and
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 move


fast
 and
 create
 value
 and
 the
 grow


together
 part
 um
 there's
 an
 element
 of


this
 is
 what
 we
 want
 it
 to
 be


and
 a
 good
 part
 of
 that
 is
 already
 the


reality
 um
 but
 I
 also
 mentioned
 the


piece
 of
 doing
 the
 right
 thing
 I
 really


believe
 it's
 running
 deeply
 uh
 in
 in
 you


know
 in
 this
 company
 people
 do
 the
 right


thing
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that
 sets
 us
 apart


we


have


um
 I
 think
 the
 grow
 together
 part
 also


is
 really
 really
 strong
 here
 we
 have
 125


offices
 I
 think
 in
 89
 countries
 it's
 a


highly
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 Global
 business


um
 and
 for
 us
 to
 come
 together
 which
 you


have
 to
 do
 when
 you
 run
 a
 network


business
 if
 everybody
 does
 their
 own


thing
 then
 the
 solution
 for
 the
 you
 know


for
 our
 customers
 will
 not
 be
 the
 samee


and
 then
 the
 network
 doesn't
 work
 um
 so


grow
 together
 is
 essential
 it's
 not
 only


nice
 and
 helpful
 and
 uh
 good
 but
 it's


also
 essential
 for
 us
 for
 what
 we
 do
 and


uh
 the
 willingness
 to
 take
 folks
 along


and
 align
 and
 coordinate
 is
 very
 high


why
 did
 we
 talk
 about
 move
 fast
 as
 well


because
 you
 can
 be
 so
 uh
 focused
 on
 grow


together
 that
 maybe
 you're
 too
 slow


because
 you're
 trying
 to
 make


compromises
 all
 day
 long
 and
 left
 and


right
 so
 we're
 trying
 to
 calibrate
 that


um
 a
 bit
 better
 um
 but
 I
 think


fundamentally
 working
 together
 doing
 the


right
 thing
 for
 our
 customers
 and


growing
 together
 with
 our
 customers
 this


is
 interesting
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 people


took
 that
 term
 and
 said
 well
 this
 is


about
 us
 and
 our
 customer
 us
 we're
 very


very
 partnership


oriented
 which
 is
 really
 important


earlier
 we
 talked
 about
 competition
 if


you
 think
 about
 the
 value
 chain
 of


payments
 today
 um
 used
 to
 be
 maybe
 a


merchant
 and
 a
 bank
 that
 was
 involved
 uh


and
 those
 were
 the
 key
 parties
 uh
 10


years
 ago
 today
 there
 is
 uh
 isvs
 PSPs


processors
 fintech
 startups
 Neo
 Banks
 it


is
 such
 a
 long
 uh
 value
 chain
 today
 and


the
 clarity
 with
 who
 is
 a
 competitor
 and


who's
 a
 partner
 is
 completely
 blurred


yeah
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 partnership
 uh


mindset
 if
 you
 don't
 look
 for
 how
 to


grow
 together
 you're
 going
 to
 start
 to


find
 that
 your
 uh
 customer
 it
 gets
 very


very
 narrow
 yeah
 so
 that's
 um
 actually
 I


made
 exactly
 that
 point
 at
 the
 investor


day
 yesterday
 and
 uh
 we
 we
 had
 some


breakout
 sessions
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 questions


on
 that
 because
 our
 investors
 look
 at


your
 investor
 looking
 at
 where
 might
 be


new
 competitors
 coming
 from
 we
 look
 at


them
 as
 potential
 competitors
 we
 hyper


paranoid
 about
 that
 we're
 always
 looking


for
 the
 partnership
 opportunity
 at
 the


same
 time
 because
 somebody
 who
 uh
 has


their
 own
 payment
 Solution
 that's
 fine


but
 it
 could
 be
 a
 dramatic
 opportunity


for
 us
 to
 power
 that
 payment
 solution


without
 a
 funding
 source
 as
 a
 Mastercard


or
 with
 a
 set
 of
 services
 other
 than


other
 um
 C
 out
 there
 who
 you


admire
 um
 I
 spend
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 effort


to
 uh
 uh
 go
 out
 and
 um
 engage
 uh
 engage


other
 CEOs
 it's
 f
 fascinating
 to
 spend


time
 together
 um
 uh
 people
 I
 spend
 time


with
 obviously
 our
 customers
 you
 know
 I


spend
 time
 with
 Jane
 you
 spoke
 to
 Jane
 I


used
 to
 work
 at
 city
 for
 14
 years
 so


obviously
 that
 that's
 what
 we
 do
 for
 the


listeners
 uh
 Jane
 is
 the
 CEO
 of
 City


Bank
 right
 yeah
 so
 um
 uh
 customer
 CEOs
 I


um
 take
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 interest
 in
 going
 to


the
 West
 Coast
 uh
 to
 uh
 some
 big
 Tech
 uh


folks
 um
 um
 I
 regularly
 speak
 uh
 to
 uh


to
 those
 companies
 Amazon
 Microsoft
 and


so
 forth
 um
 and
 obviously
 formidable


CEOs
 there
 so
 I'm
 part
 of
 various
 uh


circles
 like
 the
 business
 Round
 Table
 in


the
 in
 the
 US
 here
 where
 the
 biggest


companies
 are
 organized
 and
 um
 every


quarter
 we
 meet
 and
 you
 walk
 the
 hall


and
 everybody
 walks
 the
 hall
 and
 says


what
 do
 you
 think
 what
 about
 this
 what


about
 that
 and
 I
 find
 it
 hugely


important
 it's
 also
 fun
 um
 so
 yes
 you


have
 uh
 something
 which
 is
 really
 unique


you
 have
 uh
 Foundation
 the
 Mard


Foundation
 which
 is
 nearly
 um
 well
 got


assets
 of
 nearly
 or
 roughly
 $50
 billion


so
 huge
 right
 right
 um
 now
 I
 happen
 to


know
 the
 chief
 investment
 officer
 John


Barker
 who
 is
 excellent
 right
 um
 but


could
 you
 just
 um
 tell
 us
 what
 does


having
 such
 H
 Foundation
 do
 to
 right
 the


people
 at
 Mard
 earlier
 I
 I
 talked
 about


doing
 the
 right
 thing
 and


decency
 when
 this
 company
 I
 poed
 in
 2006


uh
 from
 previously
 being
 an
 association


it
 was
 the
 decision
 at
 the
 time
 to
 take


11%
 of
 the
 stock
 at
 the
 IPO
 and
 put
 it


into
 the
 foundation
 that
 is
 the
 Master


Guard
 Foundation


today
 um
 at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 also
 you


know
 important
 to
 ensure
 the


independence
 of
 that
 foundation
 so
 it


should
 should
 have
 not
 been
 something


that
 the
 company
 can
 decide
 at
 some


point
 well
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 this
 any


longer
 yeah
 uh
 it
 was
 clear
 we
 wanted
 to


do
 it
 I
 wasn't
 even
 there
 at
 that
 time


um
 and
 it's
 now
 there
 um
 they
 um
 we
 have


them
 come
 uh
 to
 our
 board
 meetings
 once


a
 year
 but
 they
 run
 their
 strategy
 and


wherever
 payments
 and
 Technologies


evolved
 obviously
 we
 talk
 to
 each
 other


they
 carry
 the
 brand
 which
 is
 important


I
 was
 um
 not
 too
 long
 ago
 at
 a
 u
 hotel


in


Nairobi
 and
 um
 gentleman
 helped
 me
 find


the


room
 and
 uh
 well
 walking
 down
 the
 H
 the


hallway
 to
 the
 room
 and
 he
 says
 to
 me
 uh


can
 I
 hug
 you
 and
 I'm
 like
 why
 um
 but


please
 uh
 so
 he
 gave
 me
 a
 hug
 and
 says
 I


just
 wanted
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 foundation


has
 helped
 my
 kids
 get
 into
 college
 and


the
 first
 kids
 in
 the
 family
 that
 uh
 got


into
 the
 college
 so
 the
 foundation
 does


they're
 focused
 on
 Africa
 um
 and
 they're


doing
 great
 work
 there
 on
 on
 youth


employment
 and
 and
 so
 forth
 um
 but
 we


keep
 it
 independent
 they
 or
 they
 are


independent
 full
 stop
 now
 the
 company


has
 meanwhile
 put
 out
 the
 MasterCard


impact
 fund
 um
 where
 this
 is
 closer
 to


the
 company
 where
 we
 put
 half
 a
 billion


dollars
 into
 that
 uh
 to
 start
 with
 U


three
 four
 years
 ago
 and
 uh
 um
 we
 uh


start
 to
 fund
 activities
 that
 are
 on
 the


longer
 range
 um
 of
 use
 cases
 Financial


inclusion
 oriented
 where
 we
 pull
 people


in
 into
 the
 digital
 economy
 but
 with
 the


use
 case
 that
 the
 company
 itself
 maybe


wouldn't
 do
 um
 you
 think
 you
 think
 more


companies
 should
 think
 this


way
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 do
 the
 partners


that
 we
 have
 um
 when
 we
 um
 often
 times


when
 we
 strike
 a
 strategic
 partnership


with
 a
 bank
 for
 example
 the
 shared
 value


piece
 is
 really
 hugely
 important
 they


they
 ask
 us
 what
 are
 you
 all
 doing
 to


make
 a
 difference
 beyond
 your
 immediate


p&l
 we
 said
 W
 we're
 big
 on
 financial


inclusion
 um
 we
 are
 big
 on
 supporting


small
 business
 um
 we're
 big
 on


diversity
 and
 so
 forth
 um
 so
 it
 it
 makes


a
 big
 difference
 other
 companies
 are


doing
 it
 and
 um
 I
 I
 think
 it's


fundamentally
 the
 right
 thing
 the


private
 sector
 has
 a
 huge
 role
 to
 play


um
 the
 expectation
 or
 rather
 the
 trust


level
 that
 people
 around
 the
 world
 have


in
 private
 sector
 versus
 the
 trust
 they


show
 in
 government
 these
 days
 is
 high
 so


I
 think
 uh
 the
 responsibil
 is
 on
 our


shoulders
 to
 step
 up
 um
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 it's
 always
 important
 to
 keep
 in


mind
 is
 what
 is
 the
 purpose
 of
 a


corporation
 is
 to
 drive
 shareholder


value
 and
 satisfy
 the
 customers
 and
 I


think
 we
 struck
 a
 nice
 balance
 because


particularly
 for
 us
 it's
 Financial


inclusion
 we
 set
 a
 goal
 for
 1
 billion


people
 that
 we
 will
 pull
 into
 the


digital
 economy
 and
 we
 set
 it
 in
 2015


for
 half
 a
 billion
 we
 renewed
 it
 in
 2020


in
 the
 middle
 of
 covid
 uh
 we
 went
 out


and
 said
 the
 next
 500
 million
 that
 were


committing
 to
 this
 right
 now
 because


particularly
 in
 Co
 it
 was
 really


important
 because
 all
 small
 business


kind
 of
 fell
 off
 a
 cliff
 because
 they


didn't
 have
 the
 digital
 capability
 to


operate
 in
 a
 world
 where
 everybody
 was


stuck
 at


home
 so
 we
 made
 that
 commitment
 we're


reaching
 that
 um
 so
 this
 is
 fundament


it's
 making
 a
 huge
 difference
 other


companies
 finding
 their
 own
 sweet
 spot


so
 when
 we
 when
 we
 talk
 to
 our
 customers


they
 have
 particular
 relevance
 either
 in


the
 community
 in
 which
 they
 operate
 and


so
 forth
 but
 there's
 always
 an


intersection
 point
 you
 find
 the


like-minded
 partners
 and
 uh
 that's
 been


very
 good
 for
 us
 from
 a
 business
 sense


it's
 not
 only
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do
 it's


smart
 business
 yeah
 and
 Michael
 at
 the


um
 last
 question
 here
 what's
 your
 advice


to
 young
 people
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 our


summer
 interns
 um
 at
 you
 know
 uh
 it
 was


July
 I
 think
 that
 it
 just
 came
 to
 an
 end


uh
 we
 have
 about
 800
 uh
 uh
 summer


interns
 a
 year
 um
 around
 the
 company
 all


over
 and
 I
 got
 that
 question
 from
 them


so
 I
 was
 like
 what's
 your
 advice
 I
 said


you
 know
 what
 um
 if
 you
 leave
 here
 and


you
 left
 questions


unanswered
 what
 a
 waste
 it's
 your


opportunity
 now
 you
 you
 have
 permission


to
 ask
 any
 question
 so
 you
 know
 for


those
 young
 people
 let's
 say
 it's
 people


that
 are
 look
 starting
 to
 take
 a
 new


role
 um
 in
 in
 you
 know
 post
 studies
 and


so
 forth
 use
 the
 opportunity
 of
 an


internship
 to
 really
 nerd
 out
 ask
 what


you
 ever
 wanted
 to
 do
 because
 that's


that's
 the
 time
 where
 you
 can
 do
 that


and
 that
 was
 the
 first
 piece
 of
 advice


the
 second
 piece
 of
 advice
 that
 I
 gave


them


is
 there's
 there's
 people
 walking
 around


and
 say
 well
 Follow
 Your
 Passion
 great


idea
 but
 if
 your
 passion
 um
 doesn't


really
 work
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 be
 in
 a


corporate
 environment
 for
 example
 then


that's
 yeah
 it's
 great
 but
 it's
 not
 uh


always
 great
 so
 I
 said
 figure
 out


where's
 the
 intersection
 point
 of
 what


is
 your
 passion
 what
 actually
 matters


and
 what
 could
 you
 be
 good
 at
 bring
 that


together
 be
 more
 purposeful
 about
 that


and
 um
 that
 got
 yeah
 that
 was
 a


reasonable
 amount
 of
 debate
 on
 that


point
 say
 yeah
 but
 you
 know
 I
 really


like
 doing
 this
 but
 well
 if
 this
 is
 not


that
 relevant
 maybe
 you
 find
 a
 different


balance
 between
 what
 you
 really
 love
 to


do
 and
 what
 also
 makes
 a
 difference
 and


matters
 because
 then
 you're
 likely
 to


work
 on
 something
 that
 has
 impact
 so


those
 were
 two
 pieces
 of
 wise
 advice
 and


the
 last
 set
 is
 see
 if
 you
 can
 find
 a


sponsor
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 mentorship


around
 but
 see
 if
 we
 can
 find
 a
 sponsor


somebody
 really
 leans
 in
 for
 you
 and


with
 you
 and
 isn't
 afraid
 to
 put
 your


name
 on
 the
 table
 and
 it
 matters
 that's


very
 good
 advice
 big
 thanks
 for
 being


here
 and
