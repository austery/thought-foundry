Everyone Hello, social media on, such as chow-na-na-now, also can learn a lot also can learn some people, but it's not from the bad-die-lack-stich in-bid-out-use- to find-to-use- information. Today on Twitter, I saw a tweet He said, He said, "Shoyeroye to give people Rue-Moo-Chun-Fing feeling. Believe me, your life will be far. As a young man, I think this is I need to learn. This is the way. This is the way. I've always over the I've been and think this is a really a very real people we're from from the people people don't say not not talk and the not people don't school or not all all all and all about is people and talk and people people know people talk many Another way, and he wrote And then He gave a short of the and it's, I'm just a done Promp's in the brain-naut-co-cide-per-gid-liu-cure in 99.9, in the same-down-concings on, "Share-Sewsince' "What a good-deafety." I'll read-the-uptupper of the opinion, I'll "'What'"aI.I.S.E.I.S.D., "'Who's on communication?' "'It's "Col-town." These years, many new-men technology will be out-tied. But, people with people, people-gen-any-each, including AI, communication is important, is always-of-st-of-st technology. But-sue, this is the short-back. Many people many people people-established students, not-the-s many-shan- not-o- that way that's the word was the art but he talked to some he's talking to talk about they're talking about they're saying she's even he's was a one but it is the case that the things on the things and that's name to get to the and the I'm being I'm I'm but that the thought too not too too not English, some of the professors often say, "Borce' This is a PhD. What means? It means is so permanent head damage, the long-signor brain-surned. Some Li-Congueckor did not know booker, just named the booker, but, but, then, but, then, he had-shaned permanent head-dage damage, and so much, A few Li-Cong-Koe very many in college and the at school did not at the college and the many do you do over some about the books very with other people to get to get and people and and very and very and I never never heard I never hear them and Wyn Kherst and Li Kherst, all have got high-sacring and character and very young-gonged to students. It all have some just learned to beware to beiss-lien's-down-the-er-hurt.

There are some students, been pretty smart, be be forced and being and then the college, to get a people they're they're they don't how to get them different thinking different things and to make people This was out of them They've got got lost channel and it's also out of their brain and power the mind and things the way like that's the same and how you don't know with people people is the people is the community student board this is a society technology and this is a This is this is a question Although it would impact One of the market But in the most In fact, in the most situations not to be Toeuxed from the market But AI is at a.I. Is it's a.I. A.I. One of the communication is not is getting on the top-thewater-thewater-haw- And is become a big-beye-be-to-hacin key-nong. In AI In the Ineux of There's not Our own Can't even work We're not Without We're On the We're in Twitter on We're Talked by question Overty Two-30 year World War Year's foreign security and Were Keyes all were turned to It's being seen been Now, the Wallerget and Gai-Gu all started a.I. can do the market can't make data-marr, can do design, can send-s-pings. These are the traditional-should-to-re-all-than-all-kind job-in-stri-eat. One, one, the university, to get work, just so that can go to work, is because he has got to the new example, he will make a business, the company, he's just in the he had in he's just a work. But now AI also AI also also up and people do you do better and pay and the cost cost and not even need to use this type of people and so you so it's there's there's there also it's These two years, Google, Wyn, Amazon, these techs, and social, fern ferns, ferns, ferns, and fun-fing-to-since-beck, which are by side of the number, and software, and so that many people get to quenho. On the college, it was a real-man-tron-eat, b-eat before, also, is going to find out, how the direction just turn-bent-and-and-and-all-thou-turned. Actually, the answer is very simple. AI is in p, line, get-guan, to perform, in the work. One, a lot of people need a group, everyone, work, and one of the different, work, being a design, but in AI time, a big- design, is, using AI, use using just need a few hours, to can make the time, the time, a, last year, Inouye's boss, Huang Renxun, had a turn to end up on a lot, he said, he said, "You know, 'I.'since," but AI technology will be mottling "lain"grain.'"

Some old technuians said, they've lived in the first-year online pout. Pau-mort go to the world, the online industry, shall-chun-monged-monged and career is still-stern-old, and the programmers won't have been working. They probably was the "Povet and work-eastern the work-stead.

AI, GeoSuchu, get it's the the next the new technology go to people people that the new work and the new work and Amazon company in the his his company's in the The question is, AI will create out of new work? These new work need some kind of technology. Now, you know, over-stscied technology, software, software, software, the system, and the management, and they have no new work, and new work, need to the new work, This is the real question. Open AI is a very a great name is Sean Grove. He in a in a speech data in the AI in the amount in AI's down the chunk of its'emate just on 10 to 20 and and about 80 to 90% the value from structured communication is just getgoed co-tecou-to-o-tune communication BianCen, it's through the software to get the problem the data is a the data in the in the AI time the the end of the core is can't can't provide and around people and the and give Groove said, "Grews' said, 'jecture communication is the 'tick up to "o' clear' decision to design the 'we' and the work" and then we're "What-tooltune, and afterbara' and, "if' talk-tune, "ifupto'hue'hullion, This work's value to end up the project 10% to 90% Huang Renx said AI has been people everyone to today this is to this is it is a AI industry and the Shang Groh, also said very in the eye-is-day, in the industry and every other can become a programmer, a student-execist, law-s, law-s-sue person, juror, system-s, technicals, and then. AI will make every good-shel-en- people, you-shoe-tron-en- a good-execuer become a good-o-of-the-old, here, here's the core-sin-key-n is the whole-thune. This is not just any a company needs to and is any industry is need be able to be able to a small a single. This is a new secret power. Grove I think now AI model are more more powerful, but in in-em- motion to deal when when the being in a un-n---ofâ€‘p pin-in, this pain-king is human just people human and people the The program is through data-mach and the computer-co-tong. But from Huang Renxhune and Grow's' and grow-with-to-look-back, the future just using data-mars and key-key-co-tonging even far. That's the technology is by AI AI-tie-i-wobot is people-to-one and people-the-cuit-of-kind- communication-cou-tonged. From this view to this two years, the two-year-old, the time, the technology and it's a. It's a kind of a change. The year keyeatial is 10 to 20% can be AI and it can be AI and the direct value. And a lot need to is can create the 80 to 90% 90% to the cost people people people people. In this book, the last year-sthung-monged in the long-remered some of the student-the-send if they're if they're they're, they're going to work and if you're working, do you, do that the data-the-loss-din, also, And those who have high-tall-co-couconged-eat-o-tonged people, will be as well as good-y-the-sue-due-de-none.

The first part is the face-to-one, which is we often-sue and the policy-syn. In this part, is the point-in- is the short-bant. The English education by students train to gette-go-s college and students be able to become like all the teacher and the small-s-o-tie- and the small-of-cue like school-out-to- this-e--cuit-e know-and- quite-and is one- the-eus- one-e-e This is the way model has made a lot of Gingongue-Sing people. In fact, the most of the university, the education, and education, basically is the class, teachers and students in their small in their basic knowledge, and basic knowledge and knowledge and If you go out the shah-shajohnie, in front of the vast people and society, they often are self-o-wit-who-wrote, they're used to use, they're in due-to-the-right, fie-cich-bigh, and right-the-the-cich-bigh, but-the-the-cest-bigh-bigh.

In the in the way in the way to the situation, if you get to without any of the same, they'd feel like to unseeked. They'd put this this way to do you know in a project environment. In the product, in the amount, many Maun don't understand the market work, also not understand the work, not yet not yet what is the product, not understand what's the product, and not understand the user. This is the communication of traditional, not impact on the work and it's not. Because they've got to biancinge's shrewed. But now, Huang Renxun and Groh, these year-gey-da-law said, AI, than they banded more sullen. The industry is not need this non-suelling-com.
