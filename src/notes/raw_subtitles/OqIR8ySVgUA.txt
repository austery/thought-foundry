hi
 Mark
 good
 to
 see
 you
 again
 hello
 good


morning
 how's
 everybody
 we
 are
 really


well
 thank
 you
 now
 Mark
 where
 are
 we


going
 to
 make
 money
 going


forward
 well
 so
 in
 our
 business
 uh
 the


theory
 is
 relatively
 straightforward
 uh


which
 is
 uh
 we
 make
 money
 on


technological
 disruption
 um
 and
 so
 we
 we


make
 money
 when
 these
 new
 up
 start
 uh


startups
 uh
 form
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 either


either
 try
 to
 go
 take
 down
 a
 big


incumbent
 or
 try
 to
 create
 some
 kind
 of


New
 Market
 um
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 do


um
 I
 I
 think
 for
 the
 World
 At
 Large
 uh


the
 you
 know
 the
 challenge
 is
 just
 that


there's
 a
 fundamental
 uh
 uh
 Supply


demand
 imbalance
 between
 the
 amount
 of


capital
 um
 you
 know
 that's
 seeking


productive
 uh
 economic
 investment


opportunities
 um
 and
 then
 the
 the
 number


of
 those
 opportunities
 and
 so
 I
 think


there's
 a
 a
 very
 large
 macro
 problem
 uh


on
 making
 money
 in
 the
 economy
 um
 and


and
 and
 and
 Tech
 and
 Venture
 Capital
 can


only
 be
 a
 small
 part
 of
 that
 answer
 but


but
 hopefully
 we
 will
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that


answer
 yeah
 well
 you
 see
 in
 the
 middle


of
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 you
 kind
 of


invented
 the
 Internet
 so
 um
 kicking
 off


the
 the
 AI
 question
 just
 how
 how
 will


the
 AI
 raise
 pan
 out


here
 yeah
 so
 the
 the
 the
 theory
 and
 the


Hope
 um
 certainly
 that
 we're
 betting


that
 we're
 betting
 against
 and
 investing


hard
 against
 um
 is
 that
 is
 that
 Ai
 and


specifically
 these
 new
 breakthroughs


around
 AI
 like
 like
 generative
 AI
 U


represent
 a
 new
 platform
 and
 in
 the
 in


the
 tech
 industry
 that's
 a
 sort
 of
 very


powerful
 concept
 uh
 because
 the
 idea
 of


a
 new
 platform
 in
 the
 tech
 industry
 is


sort
 of
 a
 new
 foundational
 technology
 um


that
 you
 can
 then
 imagine
 Reinventing


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 application


categories
 on
 top
 of
 and
 and
 the
 the


tech
 industry
 historically
 um
 has
 been


fueled
 by
 these
 platforms
 you
 know
 the


original
 one
 was
 the
 Mainframe
 computer


that
 then
 led
 to
 mini
 computers
 client


server
 computers
 personal
 computers


mobile
 uh
 mobile
 computers
 um
 and
 every


time
 there's
 a
 platform
 shift
 There's
 an


opportunity
 to
 reinvent
 the
 industry
 and


reinvent
 basically
 the
 entire
 ecosystem


and
 and
 all
 the
 different
 ways
 that


people
 use
 technology
 and
 and
 create
 an


entirely
 new
 generation
 of
 companies
 um


and
 so
 we
 we
 certainly
 believe
 that
 AI


is
 is
 is
 a
 is
 a
 new
 platform
 shift
 we


believe
 that
 AI
 is
 one
 of
 the
 really
 big


platform
 shifts
 we
 we
 think
 this
 you


know
 might
 the
 possibility
 exist
 that


this
 is
 on
 par
 with
 the


microprocessor
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we


think
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 to
 take
 a


very
 broad
 uh
 perspective
 here
 and


invest
 in
 many
 different
 um
 both
 core


Technologies
 and
 also
 use
 cases
 of
 of


AI
 where
 is
 the
 where
 is
 the
 kind
 of


fight
 going
 on
 just
 now
 what
 uh
 is
 it


about
 chips
 or
 money
 or
 people
 or


electricity
 just
 what
 exactly
 is
 it


yeah
 so
 the
 the
 most
 dramatic
 thing


about
 this
 this
 sort
 of
 AI
 shift
 um
 is


that
 it's
 it's
 it's
 what
 I
 call
 an


80-year
 overnight
 success
 um
 and
 so
 the


original
 paper
 on
 neural
 networks
 which


are
 the
 foundational
 technology
 of
 AI


was
 actually
 written
 in
 1943
 um
 and
 then


you
 had
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 80


years
 you
 had
 entire
 generations
 of


researchers
 who
 who
 basically
 try
 to


make
 AI
 work
 and
 for
 the
 most
 part


weren't
 weren't
 able
 to
 do
 it
 um
 in
 fact


when
 I
 when
 I
 was
 in
 school
 you
 know
 35


years
 ago
 AI
 was
 a
 was
 a
 discredited


field
 because
 there
 had
 been
 an
 AI
 boom


in
 the
 80s
 that
 that
 that
 didn't
 pan
 out


um
 and
 so
 it's
 it's
 an
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


technology
 sector
 that's
 sort
 of
 been
 in


search
 of
 of
 working
 products
 for
 a
 long


time
 um
 essentially
 what
 happened
 was


the
 Breakthrough
 moment
 was
 in
 2022
 and


it
 was
 the
 it
 was
 the
 chat
 GPT
 moment
 um


and
 so
 it
 was
 you
 know
 it's
 actually
 7


79
 years
 into
 the
 technology
 but
 it
 was


a
 breakthrough
 moment
 and
 then
 it
 was
 a


breakthrough
 moment
 of
 it
 went
 basically


from
 not
 working
 to
 working
 incredibly


well
 in
 one
 step
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 the
 the


technolog
 is
 not
 perfect
 yet
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 be
 done
 but
 it


fundamentally
 you
 know
 these
 products


are
 just
 incredible
 already
 in
 what
 they


can
 do
 and
 and
 they're
 far
 better
 out
 of


the
 gate
 than
 the
 than
 you
 know
 the


microprocessor
 was
 or
 the
 internet
 was


um
 and
 so
 it's
 this
 kind
 of
 rare


situation
 where
 you
 have
 this
 dramatic


leap
 and
 functionality
 happening


extremely
 quickly
 um
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


basically
 every
 part
 of
 the
 tech


ecosystem
 is
 trying
 to
 react
 and
 trying


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 incorporate
 AI
 or


trying
 to
 build
 on
 AI
 or
 trying
 to
 you


know
 basically
 compensate
 you
 know


figure
 out
 how
 to
 how
 to
 compensate
 for


weaknesses
 in
 AI
 um
 every
 single
 sector


of
 the
 tech
 industry
 is
 reacting
 right


now
 um
 there
 is
 a
 you
 know
 massive
 chip


you
 know
 shortage
 uh
 this
 the
 biggest


Supply
 deance
 Supply
 demand
 imbalance


and
 chips
 that
 we've
 ever
 seen
 as
 an


industry
 um
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 massive


fight
 happening
 there
 there's
 a
 massive


you
 know
 wave
 of
 data
 center
 Innovation


development
 there's
 actually
 power
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 now
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 power
 and
 cool
 these
 giant
 data


centers
 there's
 actually
 a
 Resurgence
 of


interest
 in
 nuclear
 power
 um
 around


these
 data
 centers
 um
 and
 then
 there's


there
 are
 there
 are
 basically
 fights


happening
 up
 and
 down
 the
 software
 stack


you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 fight
 that
 gets


probably
 the
 most
 publicity
 at
 the


moment
 is
 the
 fight
 between
 the
 software


companies
 building
 the
 so-call


foundation
 models
 um
 and
 so
 and
 there


there's
 sort
 of
 a
 big
 fight
 between
 a


view
 of
 the
 world
 in
 which
 there
 will
 be


a
 few
 big
 models
 that
 basically
 win


everything
 and
 then
 an
 alternate
 view
 of


the
 world
 in
 which
 this
 is
 more
 like
 the


microprocessor
 and
 there
 will
 actually


be
 you
 know
 many
 you
 know
 thousands
 of


different
 models
 running
 on
 billions
 of


devices
 um
 you
 know
 of
 many
 different


shapes
 sizes
 descriptions
 customized
 in


various
 ways
 um
 and
 and
 actually
 that


that
 latter
 thesis
 is
 the
 thesis
 we're


investing
 against
 very


aggressively
 now
 you
 said
 last
 year
 that


we
 should
 just
 stuff
 AI
 into
 everything


we
 do
 like
 weapons
 cars
 everything
 in


order
 to
 beat
 the


Chinese
 what
 do
 you


could
 you
 tell
 us
 about
 it
 yeah
 there's


there's
 sort
 of
 two
 policy
 debates
 uh


happening
 around
 AI
 um
 you
 know
 somewhat


somewhat
 for
 sure
 in
 the
 EU
 but
 for
 sure


in
 the
 US
 um
 and
 and
 there's
 sort
 of
 one


policy
 debate
 which
 is
 you
 know
 AI
 is


sort
 of
 weird
 and
 scary
 and
 we
 should


regulate
 it
 and
 we
 should
 kind
 of


prevent
 it
 from
 happening
 in
 different


ways
 and
 you
 know
 the
 EU
 has
 put
 in


place
 these
 kind
 of
 very
 onerous


regulations
 the
 UK
 has
 followed
 and
 then


there's
 a
 big
 fight
 happening
 in
 in
 in


US
 politics
 around
 this
 um
 and
 so
 this


is
 sort
 of
 an
 inward-looking
 you
 know


kind
 of
 domestic
 policy
 uh
 Viewpoint
 and


people
 have
 all
 these
 all
 these
 fears


around
 AI
 um
 there's
 a
 completely


different
 conversation
 which
 is
 the


geopolitical
 conversation
 and
 that's
 the


that's
 the
 conversation
 of
 basically
 you


know
 geopolitical
 competition
 with
 China


um
 and
 of
 course
 you
 know
 the
 minute
 you


get
 into
 that
 conversation
 it
 becomes


very
 clear
 that
 we
 need
 to
 win
 um
 and


and
 specifically
 the
 reason
 we
 need
 to


win
 is
 we
 need
 to
 win
 we
 need
 to
 win
 the


AI
 race
 with
 China
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 a


very
 analogous
 way
 that
 we
 won
 the
 you


know
 the
 sort
 of
 Technology
 race
 with


the
 Soviet
 Union
 um
 you
 know
 in
 in
 the


previous
 Century
 which
 is
 you
 know
 we


have
 two
 basically
 two
 basically


dominant
 you
 know
 mindsets
 regimes
 of


you
 know
 Western
 democracy
 and
 and
 and


and
 Chinese
 communism
 um
 you
 know
 that


both
 have
 aspirations
 to
 to
 to
 transform


the
 world
 um
 you
 know
 both
 of
 those
 are


are
 supported
 by
 Major
 you
 know
 major


nation
 states
 uh
 both
 of
 those
 are


supported
 by
 Major
 militaries
 both
 of


those
 are
 supported
 by
 Major
 economies


and
 both
 of
 those
 are
 supported
 by
 Major


Tech
 Industries
 um
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 pre
 precedent
 of
 the
 cold
 war
 with


the
 Soviet
 Union
 the
 reason
 the
 West
 won


was
 because
 of
 sort
 of
 a
 triangle
 of


technological
 superiority
 economic


superiority
 and
 then
 and
 then
 and
 then


National
 Security
 Military
 Intelligence


superiority
 um
 but
 you
 know
 we
 we


decided
 we
 wanted
 to
 win
 and
 and
 and
 we


won
 right
 and
 by
 the
 way
 our
 Victory


ended
 up
 actually
 being
 great
 for
 the


the
 people
 of
 Russia
 right
 it
 was


actually
 really
 great
 for
 the
 Soviet


Union
 to
 fall
 and
 and
 you
 know
 people


people
 in
 Russia
 are
 much
 better
 off


today
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think
 this
 is


very
 straightforward
 like
 we
 we
 need
 to


win
 we
 need
 to
 win
 by
 being
 better


technologically
 better
 economically
 and


better
 militarily
 AI
 has
 been
 identified


as
 the
 core
 technology
 uh
 for
 the
 future


of
 the
 nation
 state
 by
 both
 US
 military


planners
 by
 the
 Pentagon
 um
 as
 well
 as


by
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 Chinese


planners
 and
 so
 it
 will
 be
 one
 of
 the


main
 areas
 uh
 in
 which
 these
 you
 know


these
 kind
 of
 two
 the
 two
 hemispheres


compete
 and
 and
 and
 I
 think
 it's


important
 that
 we
 win
 where
 do
 you
 think


the
 West
 is
 now
 relative
 to


China
 so
 the
 West
 has
 I
 would
 say
 all
 of


the
 advantages
 and
 disadvantages
 of
 a


decentralized
 system
 uh
 and
 a
 market


economy
 and
 a
 and
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 system
 in


which
 governments
 don't
 control


everything
 um
 and
 you
 know
 the
 huge


advantage
 of
 that
 is
 innovation
 and


Entrepreneurship
 the
 disadvantage
 of


that
 is
 you
 know
 a
 very
 it's
 very


difficult
 for
 our
 systems
 to
 plan
 you


know
 there
 you
 know
 there
 is
 no
 top-


down
 American
 Technology
 strategy
 there


is
 no
 top
 down
 European
 technology


strategy
 those
 concepts
 are
 kind
 of
 you


know
 antithetical
 to
 our
 systems
 U
 and


so
 we're
 very
 robust
 and
 dynamic
 in


general
 um
 but
 you
 know
 we're
 very
 messy


um
 the
 Chinese
 have
 both
 the
 advantages


and
 the
 disadvantages
 of
 a
 centralized


system
 much
 like
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 did
 um


you
 know
 they
 have
 a
 command
 and
 control


system
 where
 the
 Communist
 party
 you


know
 owns
 and
 controls
 everything
 and


they
 can
 direct
 their
 private
 companies


to
 do
 whatever
 they
 want
 which
 they're


doing
 right
 now
 you
 know
 with
 sort
 of


increasing
 Force
 um
 and
 then
 they
 have


all
 the
 disadvantages
 of
 of
 a


centralized
 system
 which
 is
 you
 know


they
 have
 they
 have
 a
 command
 system
 um


you
 know
 they're
 actually
 in
 the
 process


of
 trying
 Crush
 their
 entrepreneurial


system
 right
 now
 they're
 you
 know


they're
 trying
 to
 basically
 Drive
 their


entrepreneurs
 you
 know
 out
 of
 out
 of
 you


know
 in
 many
 cases
 out
 of
 business
 in


many
 cases
 out
 of
 the
 country
 um
 and
 so


it's
 it's
 just
 like
 like
 the
 cold
 war


with
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 it's
 it's
 an


asymmetric
 situation
 each
 side
 brings


strengths
 and
 weaknesses
 and
 then
 I


would
 say
 you
 know
 each
 side
 is
 tempted


to
 embrace
 the
 model
 of
 the
 other
 side


to
 try
 to
 get
 the
 advantages
 so
 the


Chinese
 have
 kind
 of
 this
 fake


entrepreneurial
 system
 uh
 you
 know
 that


they
 kind
 kind
 of
 try
 to
 Foster
 and
 then


we
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 you
 know


sort
 of
 U
 not
 very
 effective
 you
 know


Central
 planning
 function
 uh
 you
 know
 in


in
 in
 DC
 and
 in
 Brussels
 you
 know
 that


doesn't
 work
 very
 well
 and
 and
 at
 least


I
 would
 argue
 we
 should
 lean
 into
 the


strengths
 of
 our
 system
 um
 and
 you
 know


and
 and
 try
 to
 benefit
 from
 the
 fact


that
 we
 should
 have
 a
 much
 more
 Dynamic


economy
 we
 should
 have
 much
 more


entrepreneurship
 um
 and
 and
 hopefully


that
 that'ss
 what
 we'll
 do
 to
 talking
 of


um
 dynamism
 you
 when
 we
 met
 you
 also


talked
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 investing


in
 American
 dynamism
 and
 I
 guess
 that


also
 goes
 for
 European
 dynamism
 what


what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 yeah
 so
 you


know
 look
 the
 the
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 part


of
 you
 know
 this
 is
 part
 of
 the


challenge
 for
 the
 the
 geopolitical


conflict
 as
 well
 as
 our
 our
 domestic


issues
 and
 so
 you
 know
 look
 both
 both


the
 US
 and
 EU
 I
 mean
 we're
 we're
 we're


you
 know
 we
 are
 the
 result
 of
 the


Industrial
 Revolution
 right
 we're
 a


result
 of
 the
 first
 Industrial


Revolution
 with
 things
 like
 steam
 power


we're
 the
 result
 of
 the
 Second


Industrial
 Revolution
 you
 know
 with


things
 like
 electricity
 we're
 the
 result


of
 the
 of
 the
 computer
 age
 you
 know
 the


the
 the
 West
 represented
 by
 the
 US
 and


Europe
 is
 where
 you
 know
 most
 of
 these


Technologies
 over
 the
 last
 you
 know
 300


years
 were
 developed
 um
 and
 historically


our
 society's
 benefited
 enormously
 by


this
 you
 know
 we
 we
 have
 the
 highest


standards
 of
 living
 you
 know
 are
 you


know
 children
 over
 time
 have
 you
 know


have
 done
 the
 best
 and
 and
 and
 generally


it's
 been
 a
 very
 you
 know
 synergistic


positive
 uh
 process
 um
 you
 know
 in
 the


last
 50
 years
 I
 think
 both
 American


society
 and
 EU
 Society
 has
 sort
 of
 lost


faith
 in
 the
 idea
 of
 technological


progress
 um
 and
 lost
 faith
 frankly
 in


the
 idea
 of
 economic
 progress
 and
 you


know
 decided
 to
 become
 let
 say
 I
 don't


know
 much
 more
 you
 know
 cautious
 much


more
 risk
 averse
 um
 much
 more
 you
 know


sort
 of
 unwilling
 to
 to
 think
 of
 change


as
 a
 as
 a
 positive
 and
 exciting
 thing
 um


and
 and
 you
 know
 you
 actually
 see
 that
 I


would
 say
 in
 in
 in
 in
 America
 right
 now


you
 know
 the
 relationship
 between


industry
 and
 the
 government
 is
 is
 at
 a


50-year
 low
 it's
 it's
 you
 know
 the


actually
 quite
 quite
 a
 large
 amount
 of


hostility
 between
 government
 and


Industry
 and
 the
 same
 is
 certainly
 true


in
 in
 in
 in
 Europe
 um
 and
 and
 so
 again


you
 know
 our
 view
 is
 like
 look
 we
 you


know
 we
 need
 technology
 we
 we
 need


technology
 we
 need
 Innovation
 we
 need


markets
 uh
 we
 need
 these
 things
 to


function
 why
 because
 we
 need
 growth
 um


you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 want
 our
 societies
 to


be
 growth
 societies
 we
 want
 people
 to


think
 that
 there's
 opportunity
 we
 want


people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 think
 in
 positive


um
 uh
 some
 terms
 you
 know
 we
 we
 don't


want
 people
 to
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 like


for
 me
 to
 get
 something
 I
 have
 to
 take


it
 away
 from
 somebody
 else
 we
 want
 to


you
 know
 think
 about
 our
 society
 as
 as


societies
 that
 can
 grow
 and
 flourish


where
 our
 children
 will
 do
 better
 than


we
 do
 um
 and
 so
 American
 dynamism
 is


sort
 of
 a
 very
 direct
 investment
 program


that
 we
 have
 um
 you
 know
 focused
 on


injecting
 a
 lot
 more
 technological


energy
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 sectors
 of
 the


economy
 that
 the
 government's
 very


involved
 in
 um
 and
 certainly
 defense
 and


intelligence
 are
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that
 but


also
 energy
 and
 and
 and
 law
 and


education
 and
 Healthcare
 are
 also
 big


parts
 and
 in
 all
 these
 sectors
 you
 know


frankly
 they
 they
 they
 just
 they
 I
 think


they're
 really
 suffering
 from
 a
 lack
 of


technological
 change
 and
 Innovation
 and


and
 they
 could
 really
 use
 it
 what
 would


be
 the
 key
 to
 get
 Europe
 to
 become
 more


Dynamic
 I
 mean
 not
 that
 we
 are
 not


dynamic
 in
 Europe
 but


uh
 compared
 to
 Silicon
 Valley
 we
 seem
 to


be
 lagging
 a
 bit
 behind


here
 yeah
 so
 look
 if
 you
 you
 know
 if
 you


did
 a
 rank
 order
 of
 the
 the
 top
 50


technology
 companies
 30
 years
 ago
 a


large
 percentage
 of
 them
 were
 European
 I


think
 it
 was
 about
 40%
 um
 if
 you
 did
 a


rank
 order
 today
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 out
 of


50
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 Europe
 Europe
 has


really
 falling
 off
 and
 and
 I
 guess
 the


the
 way
 I
 would
 describe
 it
 is
 it
 it


seems
 at
 least
 from
 the
 outside
 it
 seems


to
 be
 almost
 entirely
 Choice
 uh
 which
 is


it
 seems
 like
 it's
 been
 a
 choice
 to
 sort


of
 prioritize
 regulation
 and
 risk


aversion
 and
 the
 precautionary
 principle


over
 U
 you
 know
 over
 Innovation
 you
 know


the
 most
 acute
 version
 of
 that
 obviously


is
 the
 energy
 sector
 um
 you
 know
 with


the
 sort
 of
 sort
 of
 voluntary
 standown


of
 energy
 development
 which
 you
 know
 I


think
 has
 has
 led
 to
 you
 know
 real


geopolitical
 stresses
 with
 respect
 to


Russia
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 look
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 choice
 I
 think


that
 I
 think
 the
 the
 political


leadership
 class
 in
 in
 in
 um
 in
 in


Europe
 has
 decided
 that
 they
 they
 want


this
 the
 the
 voters
 so
 far
 have


supported
 them
 in
 wanting
 it
 um
 you
 know


it
 has
 it
 has
 consequences
 I
 think
 the


consequences
 are
 becoming
 clearer
 I


think
 you
 know
 fundamentally
 it's
 a


choice
 at
 a
 societal
 level
 and
 you
 know


the
 the
 voters
 will
 either
 step
 up
 or


they
 won't
 and
 the
 leaders
 will
 either


step
 up
 or
 they
 won't
 but
 but
 but
 I


think
 the
 the
 results
 of
 the
 current


approach
 are
 in
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 they're
 they're
 very
 good
 any


reflection
 any
 Reflections
 on
 your


responsibility
 as
 a
 venture
 capitalist


or
 Venture
 Capital
 investor
 at
 a
 time


where
 technology
 is
 becoming
 so


integrated
 into
 the
 race
 between
 the


superpower


you
 know
 um
 ellon
 musk
 with
 with


Starling
 suddenly
 being
 key
 in
 Ukraine


uh
 and
 so
 on
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 it
 yeah
 so
 I
 would
 describe


it
 as
 we're
 100%
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the


United
 States
 um
 and
 we're
 100%
 on
 the


side
 of
 the
 West
 um
 and
 so
 we
 we
 never


as
 a
 firm
 for
 example
 had
 an
 investment


program
 in
 China
 we
 never
 you
 know
 we


always
 view
 that
 there
 would
 be


difficulties
 from
 that
 which
 you
 know


for
 a
 long
 time
 you
 know
 looked
 like
 a


mistake
 but
 I
 think
 is
 now
 you
 know


increasingly
 clear
 so
 so
 we're
 100%
 on


the
 side
 of
 the
 US
 and
 the
 West
 um
 as
 a


firm
 we
 don't
 have
 our
 own
 foreign


policy
 we
 have
 basically
 the
 foreign


policy
 of
 the
 US
 state
 department
 um
 and


so
 we're
 you
 know
 we're
 sort
 of
 in


complete
 lock
 step
 with
 our
 uh
 with
 our


government
 you
 know
 we
 all
 of
 our


programs
 that
 involve
 anything
 involving


National
 Security
 will
 will
 will
 be


based
 you
 know
 on
 on
 on
 the
 US


government's
 view
 of
 of
 friends
 and


allies
 you
 know
 I
 would
 say
 this
 you


know
 this
 was
 a
 controversial
 position


basically
 up
 until
 Russia's
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 um
 and
 so
 up
 until
 Russia's


invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 basically
 there
 was


a
 prevailing
 ethos
 and
 Silicon
 Valley


that
 National
 Security
 is
 somehow
 bad
 or


undesirable
 or
 the
 tech
 company
 should


not
 want
 to
 you
 know
 be
 involved
 in
 it


and
 there
 was
 this
 famous
 incident
 where


go
 gole
 had
 this
 program
 with
 the
 US


Department
 of
 Defense
 that
 their
 you


know
 their
 employees
 basically
 rioted
 on


campus
 and
 forced
 them
 to
 cancel
 um
 at


the
 same
 time
 that
 Google
 actually
 had


you
 know
 an
 AI
 lab
 in
 Beijing
 that
 by


definition
 is
 you
 know
 anything
 in
 in
 in


in
 China
 sort
 of
 connected
 to
 their


Security
 State
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 there


was
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 I
 would
 think


internal
 dissension
 division
 in
 in


Silicon
 Valley
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 the


right
 role
 is
 you
 know
 between
 the


valley
 and
 the
 US
 government
 um


basically
 what
 what
 we've
 observed
 is


the
 the
 minute
 Russia
 invaded
 Ukraine
 it


was
 you
 know
 was
 obviously
 a
 catastrophe


for
 Ukraine
 and
 a
 terrible
 thing
 and
 I


wish
 it
 hadn't
 happened
 but
 it
 it
 caused


sort
 of
 an
 instant
 sort
 of
 re
 um
 I
 don't


know
 like
 a
 depolarization
 of
 this
 issue


uh
 certainly
 in
 the
 in
 the
 US
 and
 in
 the


valley
 where
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 people
 who


historically
 had
 been
 very
 averse
 to


Tech
 involvement
 in
 defense
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 became
 very
 in
 favor
 of
 it
 um
 and


you
 know
 the
 most
 Vivid
 example
 there


was
 this
 company
 andril
 that
 was
 a
 very


politically
 controversial
 company
 you


know
 our
 our
 new
 defense
 contractor
 uh


you
 know
 building
 all
 these
 automated


defense
 systems
 um
 it
 was
 a
 very


controversial
 company
 in
 the
 valley


basically
 right
 up
 to
 the
 day
 Russia


invaded
 Ukraine
 and
 ever
 since
 everybody


loves
 it


um
 you
 know
 which
 the
 founder
 of
 that


company
 points
 out
 you
 know
 there's
 some


you
 know
 some
 some
 some
 irony
 to
 that


because
 the
 company's
 doing
 the
 same


things
 um
 uh
 but
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the


Russian
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 really


highlighted
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people


including
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 on
 the


political
 left
 in
 the
 US
 that
 actually


National
 Security
 really
 matters
 and


there
 are
 actually
 bad
 people
 in
 the


world
 and
 there
 are
 you
 know
 going
 to
 be


invasions
 and
 there
 going
 to
 be
 bad


things
 that
 happen
 and
 the
 Western


democracies
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 respond


and
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 state
 of
 the


art
 being
 able
 to
 cope
 with
 these


situations
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the
 you


know
 the
 attack
 at
 Israel
 you
 know
 is
 a


is
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 second
 again
 a
 another


terrible
 thing
 but
 a
 second
 kind
 of
 uh


factor
 that
 has
 caused
 people
 to
 say


okay
 we
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that


Western
 democracies
 are
 actually
 armed


up
 yeah
 yeah
 Mark
 finishing
 off
 on
 a


completely
 different
 tag
 here
 uh
 in
 one


minute
 how
 can
 we
 become
 better


investors
 because
 that's
 the
 theme
 of


the


conference
 yeah
 so
 I
 think
 the
 question


always
 I
 I
 think
 the
 question
 for
 sort


of
 large
 institutional
 investing
 the


question
 is
 you
 know
 deployment
 of
 large


amounts
 of
 capital
 there
 just
 are
 not


that
 many
 places
 in
 the
 world
 to
 get


growth
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 the


fundamental
 challenge
 every
 large
 scale


investor
 I
 talk
 to
 deals
 with
 is
 you


know
 most
 of
 the
 capital
 that
 they


invest
 uh
 you
 know
 just
 kind
 of
 by


definition
 can't
 go
 into
 high
 growth


sectors
 um
 just
 because
 there
 aren't


that
 many
 high
 growth
 sectors
 they're


actually
 you
 know
 quite
 quite
 hard
 to


find
 um
 and
 so
 there
 are
 basically
 a


small
 number
 of
 places
 in
 the
 world
 that


have
 growth
 there
 are
 a
 small
 number
 of


people
 who
 are
 starting
 the
 kinds
 of


companies
 and
 trying
 to
 build
 the
 kinds


of
 industries
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 to
 deliver
 growth
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know


hope
 you
 know
 generally
 speaking
 you


know
 Western
 investors
 are
 quite


supportive
 of
 this
 and
 so
 you
 know


venture
 capital
 is
 quite
 well
 funded
 but


um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 focusing
 in
 on
 the


specifically
 the
 places
 and
 the
 people


who
 are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 generate


growth
 and
 then
 quite
 frankly
 the
 other


thing
 is
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 very
 helpful


when
 these
 investors
 also
 weigh
 in
 more


broadly
 than
 just
 with
 money
 uh
 and
 also


weigh
 in
 with
 their
 influence
 and
 you


know
 with
 their
 with
 their
 level
 of


authority
 and
 their
 level
 of
 of
 you
 know


persuasive
 capability
 and
 so
 forth
 in


their
 societies
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 growth


is
 something
 that
 we
 should
 be
 aspiring


for
 and
 that
 is
 is
 actually
 good
 not


just
 from
 an
 investment
 standpoint
 but


from
 a
 societal
 standpoint
 fantastic


well
 uh
 big
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 your


thoughts
 with
 us
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 all
 the


best
 of
 Lu
 going
 going
 forward
 great


thank
 you
 very
 much
 it's
 great
 to
 be


with
 you
 guys
