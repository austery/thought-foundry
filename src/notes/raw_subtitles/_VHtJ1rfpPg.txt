All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 got
 a
 red
 day.
 We've
 got
 a
 red
 day.


And
 well,
 it
 went
 red
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 day.
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 really
 had


a
 reason
 for
 why
 it
 went
 red.
 We
 didn't


get
 a
 Trump
 tweet.
 We
 didn't
 get
 some


China
 stuff
 like
 we
 didn't
 get
 some


random
 thing
 headline
 that
 you
 could


say,
 "Oh,
 obviously
 that's
 why
 the


market's
 down."
 But
 we
 did
 get


something.
 And
 it
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of


time
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 happened.
 And


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 well,
 I
 would


say
 past
 honestly
 45
 minutes,
 I
 think


I've
 come
 to
 a
 conclusion
 on
 why
 we're


red
 for
 the
 day.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 we


have
 the
 reason,
 but
 it's
 hurting
 the


entirety
 of
 the
 market.
 So,
 let's
 just


pull
 this
 up
 real
 quick
 and
 look
 at
 some


of
 the
 damage
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into


what's
 going
 on.
 Robin
 Hood
 down
 2%
 on


the
 day.
 Palunteer
 down
 1%.
 Tesla
 down


2%.
 Nvidia
 somehow
 holding
 green
 at
 180.


S&P
 back
 down
 below
 660.
 We
 were
 at
 668


at
 one
 point.
 So,
 that's
 down
 about
 1%.


Grabby
 Grab
 went
 below
 570.
 Bought
 the


dip
 at
 577.
 Bought
 the
 dip
 at
 575.


father
 did
 that
 570
 and
 here
 we
 are
 at


568.
 So
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 We're
 not


going
 to
 go
 to
 Trump.
 Trump
 is
 not


speaking
 about
 the
 markets.
 Trump
 is


speaking
 about
 in
 vitro
 fertilization.


So
 don't
 worry
 about
 what
 Trump
 is


saying
 when
 he
 talks
 about
 some


questions
 or
 he
 takes
 some
 Q&A
 from
 the


audience.
 Maybe
 in
 30
 minutes
 then
 we'll


switch
 over
 to
 him.
 But
 the
 announcement


is
 about
 in
 vitro
 fertilization.
 I
 know


you
 might
 be
 saying
 what
 the
 hell
 it's


about
 IVF.
 Yes,
 it
 is
 about
 IVF.
 He's


not
 making
 any
 commentary
 about
 the


markets.
 At least
 not
 probably
 until


Q&A.
 So
 we'll
 go
 to
 him
 when
 we
 see
 what


Trump
 says.
 Reddit
 down
 about
 1.3%.


Amazon
 down
 1%.
 I
 did
 buy
 a
 little bit


more
 Amazon
 today
 as
 well.
 PayPal
 down


3%.
 Salesforce
 was
 up
 7%.
 Now
 it's
 down


3%.
 Apple
 down
 1%.
 Again,
 all
 your
 usual


spec
 suspects
 are
 just
 taking
 a
 hit
 on


the
 day.
 AMKR
 actually
 hold
 held
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 That
 one's
 still
 green.


Again,
 this
 one
 doesn't
 really
 have
 too


much
 of
 a
 multiple.
 And
 TSM
 earnings


were
 good,
 so
 that's
 why
 that's
 holding


on.
 But
 TSM,
 which
 crushed
 earnings,


that's
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 S&P
 down
 1%.


And
 we
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 look
 at


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum.
 My
 goodness.


Bitcoin
 107,
 folks.
 It
 was
 at
 112
 this


morning,
 $5,000
 candle
 down
 on


Bittycoin.
 And
 then
 Ethereum
 obviously


getting
 hit
 as
 well,
 3,800.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 Bitmine,
 which
 was
 at
 55
 in
 the


morning,
 is
 back
 down
 to
 5134.


So,
 what's
 happening?
 Why
 is
 this


happening?
 And
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 going


on?
 Well,
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of


context,
 we
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 March
 of


2023.


What
 happened
 in
 March
 of
 2023?
 Silicon


Valley
 Bank,
 a
 regional
 bank
 in
 Silicon


Valley,
 California,
 collapsed.
 Why
 did


they
 collapse?
 The
 Fed
 raised
 rates
 at


the
 highest
 rate
 they
 did
 in
 40
 years.


Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 took
 on,
 one
 could


argue,
 some
 unnecessary
 risk
 because


rates
 were
 low.
 Rates
 went
 up
 really


fast.
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 unfortunately


had
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 they


issued
 loans
 at
 a
 way
 cheaper
 rate
 than


what
 rates
 were
 currently
 at.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 they
 ended
 up
 getting


liquidated.
 And
 that
 created
 an
 issue
 in


the
 broader
 financial
 sector.
 Now
 that


issue
 was
 contained
 pretty
 quickly.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 thought
 the
 sky
 was


falling
 when
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank


collapsed
 and
 all
 the
 regional
 banks
 uh


did
 get
 hit
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that.
 KRE,
 by


the
 way,
 the
 regional
 banking
 index
 is


down
 7%
 on
 the
 day.
 This
 doesn't
 move


like
 that.
 And
 it's
 reminiscent
 of
 what


happened
 back
 in
 March
 of
 2023
 when
 one


bank
 ended
 up
 saying
 something
 that


messed
 up
 the
 entire
 regional
 banking


ecosystem.
 So,
 what
 happened
 today?


Zion's
 Bank
 and
 Western
 Alliance,
 two


regional
 banks,
 they
 came
 out
 this


morning
 and
 they
 said
 they
 had
 some
 bad


loans.
 They
 had
 they
 said
 they
 had
 some


bad
 credit.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that,


saying
 they
 have
 some
 bad
 loans,
 bad


credit,
 and
 there's
 some
 nuances
 to
 it.


One
 could
 say
 it's
 a
 charge
 off,
 one


could
 say
 it's
 because
 of
 a
 legal


action.
 Like,
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 a


structural
 trend,
 at least
 not
 yet.
 The


most
 important
 story
 in
 the
 market
 has


turned
 away
 from
 tech
 companies
 and


their
 ability
 to
 show
 good
 earnings
 to


regional
 banks
 at least
 for
 now
 because


the
 reason
 the
 market
 is
 getting
 hit


today
 is
 if
 there
 is
 a
 credit
 crisis
 in


the
 country
 which
 is
 hard
 to
 believe


quite
 frankly
 because
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 City


Bank
 yesterday
 literally
 said
 that


credit
 delinquencies
 are
 lower
 than


expected.
 Bank
 of
 America,
 Morgan


Stanley,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Black
 Rockck,


all
 these
 guys
 said
 credit
 is
 fine.
 But


then
 you
 got
 two
 regionals
 that
 are


saying
 banks
 are
 not
 fine.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 that's
 where
 we're
 getting
 some


of
 the
 pain
 in
 the
 equity
 markets
 today.


And
 I
 think
 regional
 banks
 now
 are
 going


to
 be
 the
 most
 important
 story
 that
 we


have
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 to
 see
 how
 this


ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 We
 are
 not
 going
 to


Trump.
 So
 for
 those
 saying
 to
 listen
 to


Trump,
 he's
 talking
 about
 in
 vitro


fertilization.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 listen


to
 Trump.
 He's
 talking
 about
 IVF.
 We


will
 listen
 to
 him
 when
 he
 gets
 to
 Q&A,


but
 he's
 not
 talking
 about
 anything


around
 the
 markets.
 So
 don't
 worry
 about


listening
 to
 Trump
 right
 now.
 thought


the
 meeting
 or
 the
 3pm
 announcement
 was


going
 to
 be
 about
 the
 stock
 market.
 It's


not.
 It's
 about
 solving
 the
 population


problem
 that
 we're
 having
 right
 now.


>> Every
 company
 with
 a
 loan
 book
 in
 the


red
 right
 now
 on
 concerns
 about
 credit


quality.
 Regional
 banks
 are
 plummeting.


Alternative
 asset
 managers
 are
 slumping


and
 Jeff
 is
 tanking
 once
 again
 as
 its


name
 has
 become
 increasingly
 synonymous


with
 the
 first
 brand's
 bankruptcy.


Credit
 concerns
 at
 Zions
 and
 Western


Alliance
 spooking
 the
 entire
 sector


today.
 Zions
 revealing
 in
 a
 filing
 last


night
 that
 it
 is
 filing
 a
 lawsuit
 and


taking
 a
 provision
 of
 $60
 million
 due
 to


what
 it
 describes
 as
 quote
 apparent


misrepresentations
 and
 contractual


defaults
 related
 to
 a
 borrower.
 Western


Alliance
 filed
 its
 own
 8K
 this
 morning,


saying
 it
 doesn't
 need
 additional


provisions
 related
 to
 its
 exposure
 to


that
 borrower,
 which
 it
 had
 sued
 back
 in


August,
 alleging
 fraud.
 The
 bank


believes
 collateral
 coverage
 will
 cause


it
 to
 avoid
 losses,
 but
 Western
 Alliance


also
 had
 exposure
 to
 first
 brands,
 and


you
 can
 see
 what
 those
 stocks
 are
 doing.


They're
 down
 double-digit
 percentages.


Bank
 of
 California
 is
 another
 name
 to


watch
 today.
 As
 analysts
 point
 out,
 it


too
 has
 exposure
 to
 the
 same
 borrower.


Although
 its
 exposure
 is
 minimal
 and


senior
 in
 the
 capital
 structure,
 still


those
 shares
 down
 8%
 right
 now.
 Even


though
 exposure
 totally
 for
 each
 of


Zion's
 Western
 Alliance
 and
 Bank
 of


California
 stands
 at
 under
 2%
 relative


to
 their
 respective
 tangible
 common


equity.
 The
 markets
 are
 on
 high
 alert


about
 cracks
 in
 the
 credit
 markets


following
 the
 bankruptcies
 of
 those
 two


auto
 companies
 last
 month
 that
 sent


private
 credit
 stocks
 roing
 which
 we're


seeing
 kind
 of a
 rinse
 and
 repeat
 of


today.
 Scott.


>> All
 right,
 Leslie.
 Thank.
 So,
 in
 a


nutshell,
 what
 did
 she
 say
 for
 those


that
 just
 want
 to
 get
 the
 pure
 summary


of
 it?
 Two
 banks
 this
 morning,
 Western


Alliance
 and
 Zions
 reported
 that
 they


have
 some
 bad
 credit.
 Is
 this
 a


structural
 problem
 in
 the
 regional


banking
 industry?
 I
 don't
 know.
 No
 one


knows.
 But
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 these


stocks
 on
 the
 day,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 pretty


disgusting.
 It
 is
 a
 full-on
 wipeout
 on


some
 of
 these
 banks,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these


banks
 are
 down
 even
 worse
 than
 when
 the


screenshot
 was
 taken.
 And
 the
 reason
 I


think
 the
 broader
 market
 is
 down
 is


because
 if
 there
 is
 the
 potential
 of
 a


credit
 risk
 in
 this
 country,
 which


again,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 too
 hyperbolic


and
 say
 that's
 the
 case
 because
 we
 got
 a


lot
 of
 bank
 earnings
 from
 the
 most


important
 banks
 in
 the
 world
 and
 they


said
 that
 there's
 not
 that
 type
 of
 risk,


but
 then
 again,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 there
 is


in
 the
 regionals.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 really
 keep
 a
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 it.


But
 if
 there
 is,
 then
 yeah,
 I
 mean,


people
 would
 rather
 sell
 first
 and
 and


investigate
 later
 versus
 hold
 on
 to


their
 stocks
 assuming
 that
 it's
 a


nothing
 burger.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 just
 kind


of
 the
 psychology
 of
 the
 market.
 But
 it


doesn't
 necessarily
 seem
 like
 that
 is


the
 the
 biggest
 structural
 issue
 that


we're
 not
 announcing
 a
 war
 with
 China.


Two
 banks
 said
 they
 had
 some
 bad
 loans


and
 so
 and
 so
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 overdone.
 I
 mean,


back
 in
 April,
 we
 were
 in
 extreme
 fear.


We
 have
 not
 been
 in
 extreme
 fear
 since


April.
 In
 April,
 the
 S&P
 500
 was
 at


5,000
 and
 we
 were
 at
 extreme
 fear.
 We


are
 3%
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs
 and
 now


we're
 at
 extreme
 fear.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know


if
 that
 makes
 any
 sense,
 but


nonetheless,
 the
 fear
 and
 greed
 index
 is


telling
 you
 it's
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 But
 once


again,
 it
 feels
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 like


ALOS
 are
 taking
 advantage
 of
 this.
 Also


are
 selling.
 You
 know,
 you
 you


automatically
 get
 people
 getting
 scared


of
 a
 brand
 a
 bank
 run
 or
 a
 credit


crisis.
 They
 start
 selling.
 So,
 it
 piles


on.
 Stop
 losses
 get
 hit,
 margin
 calls,


etc.
 It's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 was
 on
 Friday


with
 that
 3%
 draw
 down.
 But,
 you
 know,


S&P
 down
 .065%
 on
 the
 day
 is
 reasonable,


especially
 given
 the
 recovery
 from
 647


on
 the
 S&P.
 Obviously,
 just
 take
 just


just
 taking
 a
 let
 down
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks


with
 you.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 bought
 some


of
 my
 favorite
 companies.
 I
 bought
 more


Grab.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 you're
 going to


give
 it
 to
 me
 below
 580,
 I'm
 going
 to


buy
 that.
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 give
 me


Amazon
 below
 250,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 that.


Especially
 if
 I
 think
 the
 regional


banking
 crisis
 is
 not
 really
 a
 crisis.


It's
 being
 perceived
 as
 a
 crisis.
 and


any
 other
 regional
 banks
 that
 come
 out


over
 the
 next
 few
 weeks
 and
 they


announce
 their
 earnings
 and
 they
 don't


have
 credit
 issues,
 I
 think
 that


reverses
 it.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 don't


think
 it
 would
 be
 the
 biggest
 deal
 in


the
 world.
 But
 nonetheless,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 this
 plays
 out.
 Now,


the
 VIX
 is
 spiking
 on
 this.
 Uh,
 as
 a


result,
 VIX,
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there,
 up


about
 20%
 on
 the
 day,
 2440
 on
 the
 VIX.


We,
 this
 is
 the
 second
 time
 we've
 had
 a


VIX
 spike
 of
 over
 20%
 in
 the
 past
 week.


Once
 was
 on
 Friday
 and
 once
 was
 on
 today


because
 of
 the
 regional
 banks
 today.


Friday
 was
 the
 Trump
 China
 tweet.
 And
 as


a
 result,
 you're
 having
 some
 pain.
 Now,


if
 you
 are
 in
 a
 high
 beta
 stock
 like


Rare
 Earth,
 you
 are
 down
 badly
 today.


TMQ
 down
 16%,
 CRML
 down
 14.
 Lithium


America
 is
 down
 22,
 MP
 down
 six,
 US
 down


15%
 on
 the
 day.
 If
 you
 are
 in
 a
 Bitcoin,


Bitcoin
 miner
 turn
 data
 center,
 you're


getting
 wrecked.
 I
 down
 nine,
 Cipher


down
 10,
 CleanSpark
 down
 14,
 Wolf
 down


10,
 Hive
 down
 14,
 Bitform
 down
 almost


20,
 Marathon
 down
 11,
 Riot
 down
 11,


Galaxy
 down
 five.
 Also,
 if
 you're
 in


some
 nuclear
 stocks
 today,
 like
 the
 OLAs


of
 the
 world,
 you
 are
 getting
 hit
 along


with
 the
 quantum
 stocks
 of
 the
 world,


D-Wave
 right
 there
 down
 about
 10%.
 Is


this
 a
 structural
 problem
 with
 all
 these


high
 beta
 stocks
 and
 the
 momentum
 is


gone
 and
 they
 are
 ready
 to
 really
 get,


you
 know,
 fall
 to
 a
 floor.
 I
 don't
 know.


But
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this,
 momentum
 is


definitely
 not
 on
 their
 side.
 And
 the


question
 simply
 becomes,
 are
 there


enough
 people
 to
 come
 in
 and
 buy
 the
 dip


or
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be
 an
 issue
 that


lasts
 for
 a
 longer
 time?
 We're
 going
 to


find
 out.
 But
 that's
 why
 we're
 in
 pain,


folks.
 That
 is
 why
 we're
 in
 pain.
 It's


the
 regionals.
 I
 really
 like
 I
 I
 mean
 I


And
 we
 should
 have
 seen
 this
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 I
 I
 just
 didn't
 pay


attention
 to
 the
 Zion's
 earnings
 because


we
 had
 so
 many
 other
 things
 going
 on.


And
 then
 by
 about
 1
 p.m.
 today,
 market


started
 taking
 a
 hit.
 And
 like
 when
 you


look
 into
 like,
 oh,
 regionals
 didn't


report
 the
 best
 uh
 quality
 of
 credit.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 that's
 why
 we're
 taking


some
 pain.
 For
 those
 that
 wanted
 to
 look


at
 Trump,
 this
 is
 a
 20
 second
 clip
 of


what
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 for


the
 next
 hour.


>> We're
 here
 today
 to
 announce
 a
 historic


victory
 for
 American
 women,
 mothers,
 and


families
 with
 the
 actions
 I
 will
 outline


this
 afternoon
 will
 dramatically
 slash


the
 cost
 of
 IVF.


And
 the
 treatment
 and
 uh
 many
 of
 the


most
 common
 fertility
 drugs
 for


countless
 millions
 of
 Americans,
 prices


are
 going
 way
 down,
 way,
 way
 down.


>> So,
 it's
 about
 IVF.
 It's
 not
 about
 the


banks
 yet.
 We
 will
 go
 to
 Trump
 if
 he


does
 Q&A
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 he
 talks
 about


China,
 the
 banks
 or
 anything
 else,
 but


right
 now
 it's
 about
 IVF.
 And
 you
 know,


actually
 when
 it
 was
 announced
 by
 like


the
 New
 York
 Times
 and
 Bloomberg
 that,


hey,
 Trump's
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about


IVF
 and
 that's
 it.
 Markets
 actually
 went


up.
 If
 anyone
 noticed,
 markets
 started


going
 up
 because
 everyone
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


cool.
 It's
 about
 IVF.
 It's
 not
 really


about,
 you
 know,
 some
 it's
 he's
 not
 like


going
 to
 make
 an
 Oval
 Office
 address


about
 the
 issues
 going
 on
 with
 China


that
 would
 spook
 out
 the
 markets.
 It's


about
 IVF.
 No
 one
 cares."
 And
 then
 an


hour
 later,
 it's
 like, "Wait
 a
 second.


These
 regionals
 are
 not
 doing
 that


good."
 And
 this
 is
 why
 it's
 so
 fun


covering
 the
 markets
 because
 one
 thing


or
 another
 is
 going
 to
 try
 to
 put
 pieces


to
 the
 puzzle
 of
 the
 story
 of


understanding
 every
 day
 what
 is


happening.
 And
 uh
 today
 you've
 got


regional
 banks
 that
 are
 creating
 the


issue.
 Um
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 bought


the
 dip,
 if
 you
 took
 some
 profits,
 let


me
 know
 what
 you
 did.
 Did
 you
 get
 Robin


Digest?
 Yes,
 I
 got
 Robin
 Digest
 finally.


That
 is
 the
 AI
 uh
 suite
 of
 products
 from


Robin
 Hood
 explaining
 why
 stocks
 are
 up


or
 down
 on
 individual
 tickers.
 I


literally
 got
 it
 10
 minutes
 ago
 and
 it's


super
 smooth,
 dude.
 It
 is
 super
 smooth.


So,
 I'm
 loving
 it.
 I've
 been
 playing


around
 with
 it
 for
 a
 couple
 minutes,
 but


I
 think
 they
 rolled
 it
 out
 to
 a
 lot
 more


people,
 so
 people
 have
 that.
 Chris
 will


be
 on
 in
 about
 10
 minutes.
 We'll
 be


talking
 a
 lot
 about
 macro,
 what's
 going


on
 in
 the
 regional
 banks.
 Chris
 was


actually
 one
 of
 the
 first
 people
 who


helped
 me
 understand
 regional
 banks
 back


in
 March
 of
 2023
 when
 we
 both
 bought


call
 debit
 spreads
 on
 Truist
 after
 it


fell
 to
 an
 11-year
 low.
 So,
 I'm
 sure
 he


has
 some
 opinions
 on
 that.
 Also
 in
 the


midst
 of
 these
 regional
 banks
 getting


hit
 the
 tenure
 we
 are
 finally
 below
 4%


which
 is
 actually
 pretty
 bullish
 and
 at


the
 same
 time
 as
 we
 are
 above
 4%.


Gold
 has
 hit
 a
 new
 alltime
 high
 at
 4,300


which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 So
 you
 got
 gold


at
 4,300o.
 I
 mean
 gold's
 been
 going
 up


like
 3%
 every
 day
 like
 that.
 That's
 not


supposed
 to
 happen
 with
 gold.
 But
 then


you
 also
 have
 the
 tenure
 coming
 down,


which
 is
 good
 because,
 you
 know,
 we
 need


the
 10-year
 to
 come
 down.
 It's
 really


important
 for
 the
 10-year
 to
 bring
 down


the
 cost
 of
 borrowing
 in
 this
 country.


It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 make
 a


narrative
 out
 of
 it
 that
 makes
 sense?
 I


don't
 really
 know.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 data
 to


see
 how
 this
 plays
 out.
 On
 top
 of
 that,


we
 have
 IBKR
 earnings
 after
 the
 bell.


I'll
 put
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat


on
 do
 you
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 on


uh
 Schwab
 had
 a
 great
 earnings,
 so
 IBKR


will
 probably
 have
 a
 good
 earnings.
 It's


just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 question
 of
 if
 the


stock
 also
 reacts
 on
 those
 earnings.


All right,
 folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


all
 for
 being
 here.
 Another
 day,
 another


time
 to
 analyze
 what
 goes
 on
 in
 the


global
 capital
 equity
 markets.
 And


today,
 the
 story
 is
 about
 regional


banks.
 It
 is
 Thursday,
 October
 16th,
 4


p.m.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 officially


closed.


All
 right,
 we're
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 We


are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


people
 saying
 I
 bought
 IBKR.
 I
 bought


some
 Hood.
 I
 bought
 some
 Weeble.
 I


bought
 uh
 BMR,
 bought
 Grab,
 bought
 Sofi.


SoFi
 got
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 2662.
 I
 see


a
 couple
 people
 saying
 I
 sold
 gold.


Other
 people
 saying
 I
 sold
 some
 of
 my


VIX
 calls.
 I
 see
 Lemonade.
 I
 see
 BMR,
 I


see
 Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 mean,
 everything
 was


down
 round
 about
 at
 least
 2
 to
 3%
 today.


On
 the
 higher
 side,
 5
 to
 7%.
 So,
 I
 see
 a


decent
 chunk
 of
 people
 that
 took


advantage


of
 those
 dips,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 more


people
 bought.
 Nvidia
 closed
 the
 day


1.13%.
 Nvidia
 actually
 holding
 on
 to
 its


green.
 Tesla
 down
 below
 430.
 That's
 down


about
 1.4%.
 Pound
 share
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Robin
 Hood,
 Robin
 Hood
 almost


lost
 130.
 Got
 pretty
 damn
 close.
 If


Bitcoin
 takes
 another
 wick
 down,
 I
 mean,


Robinet's
 probably
 going
 to
 lose
 130.


That's
 just
 the
 honest
 truth
 about
 it.


And
 I
 get
 more
 excited
 in
 the
 120.
 So,


let's
 see
 what
 happens.
 But
 Robin
 Hoodet


right
 here,
 131,
 138,
 that's
 down
 about


2%.
 AMD
 down
 2%
 of
 the
 day.
 SoFi,
 now


look,
 oh,
 let
 me
 address
 this
 real


quick.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying,
 so
 is


this
 bearish
 SoFi
 because
 the
 regional


banks
 are
 having
 some
 credit
 issues.
 My


perspective
 is
 hell
 no
 because
 SoFi
 A
 is


not
 a
 regional
 bank.
 B,
 SoFi's
 credit


writing
 is
 phenomenal.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you've


just
 done
 any
 research
 on
 their
 credit


underwriting,
 it
 is
 not
 I
 mean,
 they
 are


they
 do
 not
 take
 the
 process
 of
 credit


underwriting
 lightly.
 I
 mean,
 they


really
 focus
 hard
 on
 making
 sure
 they


give
 out
 good
 loans.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


this
 is
 a
 sell
 SoFi
 news.
 Will
 the
 ALG


go
 sell
 SoFi?
 Yeah,
 because
 it's
 a
 bank,


but
 I
 think
 that
 should
 create
 a
 good


opportunity.
 If
 we
 get
 a
 stupid
 dip
 on


SoFi,
 I
 will
 be
 a
 buyer
 as
 well
 because


I
 just
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 be


justified.
 Google
 right
 here
 252.
 Google


actually
 closing
 above
 250
 was
 bullish.


Grab
 right
 there
 576.
 Redd
 it
 down
 1%.


Amazon
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Meta
 down


1%.
 Salesforce
 still
 held
 4%
 of
 the
 day.


PayPal
 down
 3%.
 And
 then
 ELF
 up
 about


1.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Apploven
 that
 one
 held


on
 to
 the
 600.
 Circle
 down
 5%.
 Anything


Bitcoin
 related
 kind
 of
 took
 a
 hit.


Coinbase
 right
 there
 at
 330
 that
 was


down
 2%.
 Micro
 strategy
 are
 we
 below


300?
 We
 are
 at
 wow
 284
 on
 Micro


Strategy.
 Ugly,
 but
 that's
 what
 you
 got


for
 MSTR.
 Okay,
 IBKR.
 I
 think
 the


earnings
 are
 out.
 Let's
 pull
 that
 up.
 We


are
 going
 to
 pull
 up
 Weeble
 so
 we
 can


see
 the
 after
 hours
 move
 on
 this.
 Okay,


Weeble
 is
 being
 stupid.
 So,
 we'll
 go


back
 to
 Legend
 IBKR.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 a


pump.


Do
 we
 have
 a
 pump?
 Do
 we
 have
 a
 pump?
 We


do
 have
 a
 pump.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 pump.
 It's


not
 up
 2%
 after
 hours.
 It's
 more
 up
 4%,


but
 we
 are
 up.
 Looks
 like
 we
 got
 a


double
 beat.
 Looks
 like
 we
 got
 a
 double


beat
 of
 3%
 after
 hours
 on
 IBKR.
 Uh,
 let


me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 the
 exact
 earnings


in
 a
 second


and
 we'll
 see.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 on


the
 chat?
 60%
 of
 you
 said
 pump.
 60%
 of


you
 said
 pump
 for
 IBKR.
 Also,
 CSX
 is


reporting
 earnings
 today
 after
 ours.


Wow,
 you
 got
 a
 double
 beat.
 6%
 beat


across
 the
 board.
 57
 cents
 versus
 54.


That's
 an
 EPS
 beat.
 Uh,
 EPS
 is
 up
 40%


year-over-year.
 Revenues
 up
 21%


year-over-year.
 1.61
 61
 billion
 versus


1.52
 billion
 for
 IBKR.


I
 mean,
 you
 can't
 be
 too
 upset
 about


that.
 Schwab
 also
 had
 a
 phenomenal


earnings
 today.
 By
 the way,
 Schwab
 is


getting
 ready
 to
 start
 unveiling
 more


crypto
 products
 based
 on
 what
 they


talked
 about
 today.
 But
 IBKR


not
 doing
 the
 worst.
 And
 that
 one


continues


to
 Oh,
 no.
 Now
 it's
 losing
 some
 of
 it.


It
 was
 green.
 Is
 it
 losing
 it?
 It's


still
 up
 1%
 after
 hours,
 but
 you
 can
 see


that
 red
 candle
 right
 there
 from
 71
 all


the
 way
 back
 down
 to
 60.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 a


one
 or
 two%
 move
 isn't
 even
 that


volatile
 in
 the
 first
 place,
 but
 it
 is


losing


a
 bit
 of
 its
 momentum.
 Uh,
 Austin
 says,


"Net
 interest
 income
 increased
 21%
 to


967
 million
 on
 stronger
 securities,


lending
 activity,
 and
 higher
 average


customer
 margin
 loans,
 and
 customer


credit
 balance."
 Let's
 see
 if
 IBKR


actually
 put
 out
 the
 entire
 letter
 on


their
 website.


Um,
 do
 we
 have
 it?
 No,
 we
 don't
 have
 it


yet.
 Okay.
 So,
 once
 I
 get
 it,
 we'll
 get


through
 all
 of
 it.
 Oh,
 no.
 I
 got
 it.
 I


got
 it.
 I
 should
 have
 it.
 This
 is
 it.


Yep.
 Here
 we
 go.
 All
 right.
 Commission


revenue
 23%
 to
 537
 million.
 Net
 interest


income
 967
 million.
 Other
 fees
 down
 66


million.
 Uh
 general
 admin
 of
 expenses


down
 60%.
 That's
 actually
 really
 good.


They're
 taking
 their
 expenses
 down


pretty
 dramatically.
 Customer
 accounts


32%
 increase.
 Equity
 40%
 increase.
 Darts


daily
 active
 daily
 average
 revenue


trades
 that's
 up
 34%.
 That's
 incredible.


3.6
 million
 trades
 a
 day.
 Customer


margin
 loans
 39%


IBKR
 is
 loaning
 out
 77
 billion
 to


customers
 on
 margin
 40%
 year-over-year.


I
 mean
 that's
 similar
 to
 Robin
 Hood
 and


I
 think
 Schwab
 to
 an
 extent.
 Uh
 you
 know


obviously
 that
 means
 people
 are
 risk
 as


they're
 borrowing
 money
 to
 buy
 equities


but
 you
 can
 see
 those
 margin
 loans
 are


up
 and
 then
 overall
 revenue
 is
 up
 21%


yearover-year.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with
 IBKR.
 Now
 all


the
 I
 be
 care
 back
 to
 going
 green.
 All


of
 the
 fintex
 today
 took
 a
 little bit
 of


a
 hit
 uh
 unfortunately
 because
 of
 the


because
 of
 the
 uh
 regional
 bank
 stuff.


So
 CLA
 right
 here
 down
 about
 5.5%.


Square
 XYZ
 that
 one
 took
 a
 hit.
 A
 firm


took
 a
 Square
 right
 there
 down
 about


2.4%.
 Affirm
 was
 down
 about
 3%
 5.4%
 on


Affirm.
 So
 this
 regional
 bank
 issue


again
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 big
 of
 a
 deal


it's
 going to
 be.
 Look
 at
 Truis
 down
 5%


on
 the
 day.
 The
 overall
 index
 took
 a


nasty
 hit.
 Kerry
 right
 there
 down
 almost


7%.
 Zions,
 which
 was
 one
 of
 the
 main


culprits,
 that
 one
 down
 13%
 on
 the
 day.


And
 then
 Western
 Alliance
 Bank,
 that
 one


down
 8%.
 We
 needed
 to
 get
 a
 good


earnings
 for
 Q3.
 And
 so
 far,
 we've
 got
 a


good
 earnings.
 It's
 just
 two
 of
 these


regional
 banks
 have
 not
 been
 the
 best
 on


earnings.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 that's


what's
 creating
 some
 pain
 as
 markets
 are


very
 close
 to
 alltime
 highs.
 CSX
 that
 is


green
 after
 hours
 as
 well.
 It
 looks
 like


we've
 got
 those
 earnings.
 Um
 adjusted


EPS
 of
 44
 cents.
 No,
 miss.


Uh,
 and
 then
 revenue
 is
 a
 beat.
 Okay,
 so


they
 looks
 like
 they
 missed
 on
 EPS.
 They


beat
 on
 revenue.


I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 CSX
 is
 to
 be


honest.
 Oh,
 no,
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


bottom.
 Okay,
 so
 they
 beat
 by
 5%
 on
 EPS.


They
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 CSX,
 what
 is
 this


company?


Tra
 uh,
 American
 Holding
 Company
 focused


on
 rail,
 transportation,
 and
 real
 estate


in
 North
 America.
 Market
 cap
 of
 67


billion.


Uh,
 dividend
 of
 1.4%.
 Year-to
 date.
 This


stock
 is
 up
 about
 11.3%.
 So
 definitely


not
 a
 small
 company,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 a


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 for
 these


guys.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 stock
 is


reacting
 favorably.
 Let's
 pull
 up
 some


coverage
 on
 the
 and
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Let's
 pull
 this


up
 and
 then
 we
 got
 some
 updates
 on
 what


Trump
 is
 saying.
 We'll
 see
 what
 we've


got.


>> Frank
 Holland
 has
 the
 numbers.
 Frank.


>> Yeah,
 John,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 stocks


moving
 higher
 right
 now
 after
 revenues


that
 were
 in
 line,
 but
 a
 beat
 on
 EPS.


The
 estimate
 was
 42
 cents
 a
 share.
 It


came
 out
 at
 44
 cents
 a
 share.
 We're


looking
 deeper
 in
 the
 report,
 though.


When
 you
 look
 at
 the
 company's


merchandise
 segment,
 that's
 where
 they


generate
 almost
 2/3
 of
 revenue.
 The


revenues
 there
 were
 essentially
 flat.


The
 company
 had
 promised
 volume
 growth


throughout
 the
 year.
 We
 actually
 saw
 the


volume
 in
 the
 in
 the
 merchandise
 segment


flat
 again.
 But
 overall
 volumes
 for
 the


company
 were
 down
 2%.
 That's
 going
 to
 be


something
 very
 important
 for
 the
 new
 CEO


to
 to
 deal
 with
 in
 this
 company.
 Uh
 he


actually
 put
 out
 a
 statement
 saying
 that


the
 company
 saw
 some
 strength
 in
 its


inner
 modal
 volume.
 That
 was
 something


that
 we
 actually
 talked
 about
 just
 a


short
 time
 ago
 on
 closing
 bell.
 The
 fact


that
 the
 company
 expected
 to
 see


strength
 in
 interotal
 following
 its


partnership
 with
 BNSF,
 the
 West
 Coast


Rail
 also
 expected
 to
 get
 some
 volumes


from
 JB
 Hunt
 that's
 also
 moving
 much


higher
 right
 now.
 Uh
 but
 again,
 shares


of
 CSX
 up
 about
 2
 and
 a
 half%
 after


revenues
 there
 were
 in
 line
 and
 a
 beat


on
 EPS.
 The
 strength
 really
 came
 from


its
 container
 shipping
 business.
 All


right,
 so
 CSX
 and
 IBKR,
 I
 mean,
 they
 did


their
 thing
 in
 terms
 of
 delivering
 us


good
 earnings.
 It's
 just
 these
 freaking


regional
 banks.
 They
 did
 not
 have
 the


best
 earnings
 today.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


you're
 not
 getting
 some
 pain.
 Uh,


Terowolf
 announces
 prices
 of
 3.2
 billion


of
 senior
 secured
 notes
 and
 proceeds.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 new
 delution,
 right?


That's
 older
 delution.


Terwolf
 still
 is
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Again,


all
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 got
 hit
 pretty


bad
 today.
 Okay,
 Terolf
 up
 a
 little
 bit


after
 hours,
 but
 not
 seeing
 too
 much
 of


an
 impact
 from
 that
 news.
 Trump
 is
 not


talking
 right
 now.
 There's
 some
 other


lady
 in
 the
 IVF
 conference
 talking.
 Um,


Trump
 probably
 will
 get
 to
 Q&A
 soon,
 but


there's
 someone
 else
 right
 now
 talking


about
 IVF.
 I
 really
 didn't
 think
 the


announcement
 today
 was
 going
 to
 be
 about


IVF.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 going
 to
 have
 to
 do


something
 with
 China,
 but
 it
 ended
 up


being
 about
 fertility
 and
 uh
 the


population
 crisis,
 which
 look,
 it's
 a


legit
 concern.
 It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 when


regionals
 [ __ ]
 the
 bed,
 everyone's
 a


little
 worried
 about
 something
 else.
 But


UNH
 right
 there
 also
 down
 about
 1.6%
 on


the
 day.


IBKR
 and
 Hood
 both
 have
 the
 similar
 uh


margin
 book,
 but
 their
 IBKR
 is
 77


billion.
 Hood
 is
 10
 billion.
 Yeah,
 Hood


is
 I
 think
 now
 almost
 12
 billion.
 So


IBKR
 vast,
 you
 know,
 a
 quintupling
 of


Hood's
 margin
 book
 and
 they
 make
 a
 lot


more
 money
 off
 of
 it.
 But
 the
 point
 is


all
 the
 brokerages
 are
 giving
 out
 lots


of
 margin
 because
 comp,
 you
 know,


consumers
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 for
 margin


and
 as
 rates
 come
 down,
 the
 cost
 of


borrowing
 capital
 gets
 cheaper.
 So,
 you


know,
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 borrow
 more,


it's
 just
 when
 the
 market
 crashes,
 if


the
 market
 crashes,
 you
 know,
 and
 you


can't
 pay
 back
 your
 margin
 load,
 that's


when
 things
 can
 get
 ugly.
 So
 that
 is
 the


risk
 that
 is
 there
 right
 now.
 Now,
 Corey


was
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 If
 we
 get
 to
 some


other
 headlines,
 we'll
 see
 what
 Trump's


talking
 about
 in
 a
 bit.
 Coreweee
 was
 up


1.4%
 of the
 day.
 The
 reason
 Coree
 was
 up


is
 because
 uh
 XAI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 leasing


a
 $20
 billion
 package
 to
 own
 Nvidia


GPUs.
 This
 was
 actually
 announced
 a


couple
 days
 ago
 and
 it
 was
 kind
 of


confirmed
 today.
 Coree
 is
 estimated
 to


be
 one
 of
 the
 core
 companies
 that's


going
 to
 be
 helping
 XAI
 lease
 a
 bunch
 a


bunch
 of
 those
 GPUs
 potentially
 also
 in


Texas.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 Coree
 ended
 up


going
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Nabius
 also
 got


a
 boost
 right
 when
 that
 announcement


came
 out.
 Nabius
 could
 not
 end
 red
 on


the
 day.
 Got
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 130.


Closed
 at
 123,
 but
 all
 the
 data
 center


companies
 outside
 of
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners


got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 boost
 once
 that


announcement
 did
 come
 out.


So,
 that's
 what
 we've
 got.
 Open
 door,


how
 did
 that
 do
 on
 the
 day?
 Open
 708,


the
 meme
 stock
 ETF.
 This
 one
 took
 a
 hit,


down
 8%
 on
 the
 day,
 back
 under
 $10.
 In


terms
 of
 the
 most
 traded
 options
 in
 the


stock
 market
 today,
 Nvidia
 and
 Tesla


were
 number
 one
 and
 two.
 Then
 you
 had


iBit,
 AMD,
 Amazon,
 Palenteer,
 Apple,


Micro
 Strategy,
 Regetti,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


quantum
 stocks
 down
 in
 the
 day.
 So Sofi,


Google,
 Intel,
 Micron,
 Oracle,
 Marathon,


Cory,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 TSM,
 Meta,
 and


Openor.
 I'm
 surprised
 none
 of
 the


regional
 banks
 actually
 made
 it
 into
 the


top
 20.
 Uh
 so,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 the


concerns
 weren't
 enough
 to
 get
 the


options
 market
 super
 excited
 on
 buying


puts
 on
 regional
 banks.
 But
 nonetheless,


that
 is
 now
 a
 new
 concern
 that
 a
 lot
 of


us
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 look
 into.


And
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 Did
 you
 buy


more
 Grab?
 Yes,
 I
 bought
 more
 Grab


today.
 Bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 Amazon.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 didn't
 buy
 a
 crazy


amount
 of
 the
 dip
 today.
 I
 nibbled
 here


and
 there.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 regional


banking
 thing
 is
 the
 biggest
 issue
 in


the
 world.
 Realistically,
 an
 hour
 ago
 is


when
 it
 became
 more
 apparent
 to
 me
 that


this
 was
 the
 reason
 the
 market
 was


actually
 upset.
 And
 we're
 just
 going
 to


have
 to
 see,
 you
 know,
 how
 long
 this


ends
 up
 playing
 out
 in
 regards
 to
 retail


banks.
 Now,
 the
 one
 final
 thing
 I
 want


to
 say
 on
 regional
 banks
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 Chris
 onto
 the
 show
 for
 Macro


Thursdays
 is
 that
 the
 government


shutdown
 might
 be
 doing
 something
 to
 the


regional
 banks.
 By
 the
 way,
 real
 quick


before
 that,
 uh,
 Perplexity
 launched
 a


new
 language
 feature
 today.
 That's
 why


Duolingo
 was
 down
 5%.


All
 of
 these
 tech
 companies,
 they're


going
 after
 language
 for
 some
 reason.


Language
 is
 the
 biggest
 thing
 they
 want


to
 cure
 with
 AI.
 And
 I
 think
 Dolingo
 is


just
 like,
 "Dude,
 do
 all
 of
 you
 guys


have
 to
 focus
 on
 what
 we
 focus
 on?
 like


can
 you
 just
 like
 let
 us
 chill
 out?
 But


that
 was
 Duelingo.
 Okay.
 So,
 one
 of
 the


issues
 with
 regional
 banks
 in
 terms
 of


the
 shutdown
 right
 here
 is
 from
 this


idea.
 A
 lot
 of
 regional
 banks
 rely
 on


short-term
 liquidity,
 aka
 cash
 on
 hand,


to
 cover
 daily
 operations.
 Weekly


government
 payments
 temporarily
 boost


the
 cash
 on
 hand
 for
 these
 regional


banks,
 aka
 their
 float.
 But
 when
 a


shutdown
 stops
 these
 payments,
 banks


must
 sell
 assets
 to
 stay
 liquid.
 Right


now,
 large
 Treasury
 settlements
 are


draining
 cash
 and
 banks
 are
 borrowing


heavily
 from
 the
 Fed
 to
 cover
 gaps.
 That


selling
 pressure
 ripples
 through
 into


the
 broader
 market.
 This
 is
 one
 theory.


This
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 the
 only
 theory.


Uh
 especially
 because
 the
 shutdown
 has


only
 been
 happening
 for
 two
 weeks.
 And


you
 know,
 these
 earnings
 that
 tanked
 the


market
 today
 from
 these
 regional
 banks


are
 from
 last
 quarter.
 So,
 they
 really


don't
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 what


what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 But
 one


argument
 could
 be
 the
 perception
 of
 the


government
 shutdown
 is
 having
 a


short-term
 liquidity
 impact
 on
 some
 of


these
 regional
 banks.
 And
 that
 from
 a


perceptual
 perspective
 could
 be
 the


reason
 why
 the
 market's
 losing
 some
 of


its
 momentum.


>> Having
 said
 that,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about
 today
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 10-year


inflation,
 interest
 rates,
 regional


banks.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 let's
 get


into
 macro
 Thursday.
 Chris
 Patel,
 what's


up?


>> Happy
 sub4%
 on
 the
 10-year
 day.
 Finally,


after


I
 think
 almost
 nine
 months,
 we're
 below


four
 below
 4%
 on
 the
 10-year,
 which
 is


always
 nice.
 It
 looks
 like
 we
 might


sustain
 it
 too
 eventually.


>> I
 hope
 so,
 man.
 I
 hope
 so.
 There's
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 need
 to
 refinance,
 a
 lot


of
 businesses
 that
 need
 to
 start
 working


uh
 working
 on
 planning
 for
 their
 uh
 debt


issuances
 for
 next
 year.
 So
 by
 by
 uh


getting
 the
 longer
 term
 rates
 down,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 a
 big
 positive
 for
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 businesses
 and
 you
 know,


even
 people
 like
 average
 people
 that


need
 to
 refinance
 their
 homes
 lower


because
 they
 bought,
 you
 know,
 during


22,
 23
 or
 24,
 25
 and
 they're
 sitting
 on


seven,
 you
 know,
 they
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 got
 sold
 on
 this
 stupid
 thing


which
 is
 marry
 the
 house
 and
 date
 the


rate
 or
 some
 [ __ ]
 like
 that.
 You
 ever


heard
 of
 that
 before?


>> Yeah.
 Yep.
 Yep.


>> You're
 muted.
 I
 can't
 hear
 you.
 I
 don't


know if
 it's
 just
 me.


>> No,
 no,
 it's
 just
 you.
 It's
 just
 you.


>> No,
 it's
 probably
 me.
 One
 second.


>> Uh,


>> we
 got
 We
 got
 to
 make
 an
 intro
 for
 Macro


Thursdays.
 That's
 correct.
 We
 do
 got
 to


make
 an
 intro
 for
 that.


>> Dude,
 someone
 called
 him
 Indian
 Steve.


>> You
 can
 hear
 me
 now?


>> No,
 you
 still
 can't
 hear
 me.


We
 have
 Asian
 Steve,
 regular
 Steve,
 and


Indian
 Steve.


>> Yeah,
 technically
 it's
 Indian
 Steve.


Man,
 I
 was
 on
 here
 before
 Steve
 was.


>> That's
 true.
 Oh,
 you
 can
 hear
 me
 now,


right?


>> There
 we
 go.


Sorry,
 my
 uh
 my
 headphones
 are
 uh


weren't
 connected.


>> Okay.
 Can
 you
 hear
 me?


>> Yeah,
 I
 can
 hear
 you.
 Okay.


>> Okay,
 Chris,
 I
 would
 zoom
 out
 a
 little


bit
 because
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 zoomed


in
 on
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> No,
 no,
 that's
 that's
 too
 close.
 Okay,


perfect.
 Perfect.


>> There
 we
 go.


>> Okay.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about


with
 the
 tenure.
 Let's
 start
 off
 with


this
 dude
 because
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 about


regional
 banks
 and
 obviously
 you've
 seen


what
 has
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 two


hours
 with
 these
 regional
 banks.
 Do
 you


think
 based
 on
 what
 uh
 Zions
 and
 Western


Alliance
 said
 we
 might
 have
 a
 structural


problem
 with
 credit
 based
 on
 these


regional
 banks?


>> Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 nearly
 as
 systemic


as
 um
 as
 people
 are
 making
 it
 out
 to
 be.


Um
 so
 uh
 let
 me
 let
 me
 briefly
 give
 some


people
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 background
 on


regional
 banks
 versus
 like
 your


traditional
 JP
 Morgans
 and
 Well
 Fargo


you
 know
 based
 on
 how
 big
 you
 are
 as
 a


bank
 there's
 certain
 restrictions
 that


were
 placed
 uh
 that
 were
 that
 were
 put


on
 you
 after
 the
 great
 financial
 crisis


where
 the
 bigger
 you
 were
 the
 more


likely
 it
 is
 that
 you
 know
 you
 had
 to


retain
 more
 capital
 on
 your
 balance


sheet
 and
 you
 could
 not
 lend
 that
 out.


Now
 because
 of
 that
 there
 are
 other


banks
 and
 non
 non
 non-banks
 that
 kind
 of


filled
 the
 gap
 right
 so
 basically
 they


came
 in
 and
 said
 look
 we
 you
 know
 we


know
 the
 big
 banks
 can't
 lend
 you
 money


but
 maybe
 we
 can
 we'll
 help
 you
 out


right
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 regional
 banks
 if


you
 wanted
 like
 let's
 say
 a
 car
 loan
 or


a
 home
 loan
 or
 whatever
 you
 could
 go
 to


your
 local
 regional
 bank
 your
 credit


unions
 and
 basically
 get
 the
 loans
 that


you
 needed
 because
 the
 big
 banks


wouldn't
 necessarily
 have
 that
 money
 to


lend
 to
 you
 or
 the
 the
 rates
 that
 they


were
 trying
 to
 give
 you
 were
 not
 as
 uh


as
 good.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 now
 is
 just
 some
 tailwinds
 from
 uh


from
 the
 fallout
 withricolor
 and
 some
 of


these
 other
 ABS
 originators.
 And
 uh


that's
 a
 big
 problem.
 And
 I
 think
 I


mentioned
 this
 the
 last
 time
 we
 were
 on


here
 about
 auto
 loans,
 how
 they
 were


being
 fraudulently
 issued.
 and
 also
 like


this
 whole
 business
 of
 subprime


borrowers
 getting
 loans
 for
 used
 cars
 at


crazy
 crazy
 high
 rates.
 I
 was
 actually


just
 at
 lunch
 today
 with
 uh
 with
 my


accountant
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 me
 about


um
 certain


certain
 transactions
 that
 he
 had
 seen


with
 some
 of
 his
 clients
 where
 a
 lot
 of


like
 let's
 say
 you're
 an
 immigrant
 like


an
 illegal
 and
 you
 wanted
 to
 buy
 a
 car,


right?
 Or
 a
 truck
 whatever.
 um
 you
 can't


go
 to
 the
 traditional
 banking
 bank
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 G,
 let
 me
 borrow
 15$20,000
 to


buy
 this
 used
 truck."
 So,
 they
 were


going
 to
 these
 quote
 unquote
 weird


lenders
 that
 essentially
 charged
 crazy


and
 high
 interest
 rates
 like
 10
 15%.
 But


essentially,
 they
 would
 give
 you
 that


loan,
 right?
 Um
 the
 challenge
 is
 with


all
 the
 deportations
 and
 all
 this


happening
 can't
 exactly
 go
 after
 someone


that
 just
 got
 deported,
 right?
 So
 you're


starting
 to
 see
 things
 like
 that
 kind
 of


creep
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 into
 this
 uh
 into


this
 thing.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 are
 happening.
 Um


there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 fallout
 from


commercial
 real
 estate
 where
 a
 lot
 of


these
 regional
 banks
 they
 held
 debt
 from


commercial
 commercial
 uh
 commercial
 real


estate
 and
 instead
 of
 calling
 those


loans
 in
 when
 they
 matured
 they


essentially
 just
 pretended
 like
 they


didn't
 default
 and
 they
 just
 extended


the
 extended
 the
 maturity.
 Well,
 that


only
 works
 for
 so
 long
 before
 people


start
 asking
 questions
 and
 people
 try


start
 doing
 something
 called
 mark


tomarket
 where
 if
 you
 if
 let's
 say


there's
 a
 property
 that
 you
 know
 they


needed
 $500
 million
 in
 2017
 and
 that


property
 is
 now
 only
 worth
 $250
 million


but
 on
 your
 books
 you're
 saying
 that
 the


asset
 is
 actually
 still
 worth
 $500


million
 because
 you
 didn't
 rerate
 it


down.
 That
 means
 that
 when
 you
 do


actually
 get
 it
 rerated,
 that
 means
 that


now
 you
 have
 to
 eat
 that
 cost.
 So,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 worried
 like,
 "Hey,
 wait
 a


second.
 Am
 I
 is
 my
 bank
 one
 of
 the
 ones


that
 has
 issued
 all
 these
 bad
 loans
 or


or
 coll
 undercolateralized?"


And
 so,
 that's
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


kind
 of
 scared.
 And
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is


because
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 Jaime
 Diamond


Jamie
 Diamond
 um
 kind
 of
 said,
 I
 don't


know if
 you
 saw
 the
 quote
 from
 Jamie


Diamond.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 he
 he
 talked
 about
 cockroaches


basically
 and
 said
 that


>> yeah,
 the
 exact
 quote
 right
 here
 is
 um
 I


mean
 Michael,
 you
 should
 assume
 that


whenever
 something
 happens,
 we
 scour
 old


processes,
 old
 procedures,
 old


underwriting,
 all
 everything,
 and
 we


think
 we're
 okay
 and
 other
 stuff.
 But
 my


antenna
 goes
 up
 when
 things
 like
 that


happen.
 And
 I
 probably
 shouldn't
 say


this,
 but
 when
 you
 see
 one
 cockroach,


there
 are
 probably
 more.
 And
 so
 we


should
 everyone
 should
 be
 forewarned
 on


this
 one.
 Do
 do
 you
 think
 he's
 he's


making
 a
 legitimate
 point
 that
 there
 are


cockroaches
 in
 the
 credit
 sector
 of
 the


country?
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 talked
 about


these
 auto
 loans
 and
 what's
 going
 on


with
 legal
 immigrants.
 Could
 that
 like


on
 a
 percentage
 basis,
 I
 know
 it's
 kind


of a
 gut
 reaction
 today,
 but
 what
 10%


20%
 chance
 that
 it's
 a
 real
 issue
 in
 the


country
 right
 now?


>> It's
 too
 small
 to
 be
 a
 major
 issue.
 This


is
 not
 2008.
 2008,


like
 you're
 talking
 about
 the
 the
 the


mortgage
 market,
 right?
 And
 underwriting


has
 gotten
 a
 lot
 better
 since
 2008.
 So,


it's
 not
 necessarily
 as
 impactful
 as


2008,
 but
 there's
 definitely
 a
 lot
 of


banks
 that
 are
 out
 there
 that
 are
 uh
 not


not
 exactly
 in
 the
 greatest
 of
 shapes.


Um,
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 the
 biggest


challenge
 that
 you
 have
 is
 businesses


being
 marked
 marked
 to
 market.
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 non-traditional
 bank


lenders
 that
 have
 come
 in
 and
 provided


capital
 and
 they
 they
 don't
 want
 to


declare
 what
 the
 real
 value
 of
 these


underlying
 businesses
 are
 and
 if
 that's


the
 case
 then
 the
 loans
 that
 they've


issued
 are
 not
 good.
 So
 you
 know
 it's


this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 times
 where


confidence
 is
 being
 shaken
 in
 the


financial
 uh
 sector
 and
 the
 thing
 is
 do


I
 think
 it's
 a
 do
 I
 think
 it's
 a


systemic
 issue?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I


think
 the
 banks,
 the
 regional
 banks
 have


had
 plenty
 of
 time
 to
 kind
 of
 rightsize


some
 of
 their
 balance
 sheets.
 So,
 this


is
 the
 time
 where
 you
 want
 to
 kind
 of


look
 at
 the
 regional
 banks
 and
 look
 at


the
 ones
 that
 are
 being
 sold
 off
 and
 uh


and
 and
 look
 at
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 the


strongest
 that
 have
 the
 best
 credit


profiles.
 Unfortunately,
 this
 is
 this
 is


not
 public
 information
 that
 we
 can
 reach


into
 like
 SEC
 filings
 and
 look
 for
 like


bad
 credit
 events.
 like
 you
 can't
 say,


okay,
 yeah,
 they
 issued
 loans
 to
 this


specific
 company
 and
 or
 or
 they
 have


loans
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet
 that
 has
 this


kind
 of
 exposure.
 So,
 it's
 really
 hard


to
 um
 to
 figure
 that
 out.
 So,
 you
 have


to
 just
 rely
 on,
 hey,
 what
 is
 the
 what


is
 the
 management
 of
 this
 business
 like?


How
 credible
 are
 they?
 How
 what
 kind
 of


processes
 do
 they
 have
 in
 place
 to
 make


sure
 that
 they're
 not
 they
 haven't
 been


issuing
 a
 lot
 of
 fraudulent
 um
 um
 fraud?


I'm
 not
 and
 and
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily


have
 to
 be
 fraud,
 by
 the
 way.
 It
 could


also
 just
 be
 making
 bad
 loans
 that
 they


don't
 want
 to
 recognize.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 anything


of
 like
 when
 this
 happened
 in
 2023,
 the


big
 banks
 got
 bigger
 because
 they
 ended


up
 acquiring
 the
 regionals
 that
 failed


and
 that
 kind
 of
 stopped
 the
 contagion


from
 becoming
 a
 contagion.
 If
 it
 does


and
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 collapsed
 like


that
 was
 a
 thousand
 times
 worse
 than


Zion
 saying
 they
 had
 a
 $50
 million


charge
 off.
 One
 of
 those
 was
 because
 of


a
 u
 uh
 a
 legal
 injunction.
 So
 it
 might


not
 even
 fully
 be
 just
 because
 of
 bad


credit,
 but
 to
 your
 point,
 when
 the


markets
 get
 scared
 about
 credit
 issues,


you
 know,
 everything
 gets
 sold
 off.


>> Well,
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 was
 was
 more


structural
 than
 actual
 like
 bad
 credit.


Basically
 what
 they
 did
 was
 they


borrowed
 they
 had
 all
 these
 depositors


and
 what
 they
 did
 was
 they
 bought


treasuries
 with
 them
 and
 the
 treasuries


were
 yielding
 barely
 anything
 and
 at
 the


same
 time


um
 you
 know
 they
 had
 a
 bank
 run
 and
 so


now
 you
 have
 this
 really
 illquid
 well


technically
 it's
 super
 liquid
 but
 the


the
 lo
 the
 further
 out
 treasuries
 that


they
 had
 were
 illquid
 and
 they
 would


have
 had
 to
 take
 a
 giant
 write
 off.
 So,


you
 know,
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank,
 First


Republic,
 those
 are
 a
 little
 bit


different.
 Um,
 this
 time
 around,
 people


are
 just
 worried
 and
 especially
 because


some
 of
 these
 originators


have
 gone
 out
 of
 business.
 Like,
 this


other
 one
 that
 they
 they
 have,
 I
 for
 I


forgot
 the
 names,
 but
 they're
 not
 that


big.
 So,
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 I
 would


be
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 is
 a
 systemic


issue
 with
 massive
 rampid
 fraud
 all
 over


the
 place."
 I
 will
 say
 this
 though,


there
 could
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 used
 cars
 on


the
 market.
 Chris,
 I'm
 gonna
 stop
 you


real
 real
 quick
 right
 there.
 Trump's


taking
 questions.
 Uh
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 get


any
 questions
 of
 value
 and
 then
 we'll


we'll
 go
 back.


>> Please,
 Mr.
 President,


>> you
 posted
 earlier
 today.
 Please,


>> Mr.
 President,
 this
 is
 a
 major
 campaign


promise
 that
 you
 made.
 It
 was
 a
 big
 hot


topic
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 election.


You're
 delivering
 on
 that.
 Again,
 I


actually
 had
 a
 question
 for
 Secretary


Kennedy
 or
 Dr.
 Heidi.
 Dr.
 Heidi,
 you


said
 something
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 really


important.
 You
 talked
 about
 how
 this


coverage
 option,
 this
 benefit
 option


gives
 companies
 the
 maximum
 flexibility


to
 design
 uh
 benefits
 consistent
 to


their
 values.
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 either


you
 or
 the
 president
 could
 expand
 on


that
 and
 talk
 about
 why
 that's
 an


important
 thing
 to
 understand
 about
 this


program.


>> Yes,
 thank
 you.
 It's
 a
 great
 question.


We
 think
 that
 employers
 are
 best


situated
 to
 know
 what
 what
 them
 and


their
 employees
 when
 are
 want
 to


contribute
 to
 in
 relation
 to
 their


benefits.
 So
 employers
 are
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 decide
 these
 two
 um
 see
 certain


types
 of
 doctors
 and
 they
 can
 work
 with


providers
 that
 are
 identifying
 the


highest
 quality
 fertility
 providers
 and


so
 it
 gives
 it
 puts
 them
 in
 the
 driver's


seat
 and
 our
 view
 is
 that
 we
 want


employers
 to
 be
 the
 ones
 that
 can
 make


those
 decisions
 not
 the
 government.


>> Thank
 you.


>> That's
 a
 good
 answer.


>> Yeah.
 Well
 is
 a
 very
 good
 answer.


>> Mr.
 Mr.
 President,
 Mr.
 Mr.
 President,


um,
 previously
 you
 did
 not
 seem
 to
 be


bothered
 uh
 regarding
 Hamas
 track


cracking
 down
 on
 uh
 what
 you
 called
 um


>> All
 right.
 So,
 we're
 not
 getting
 actual


questions
 about
 China
 or
 anything


economical.
 So,
 we'll
 get
 some
 quotes.
 I


will
 pull
 up
 the
 quotes
 whenever
 we
 get


them
 in
 real
 time
 for
 whatever
 Trump


says,
 but
 those
 questions
 are
 more
 on


the
 other
 political
 issues.
 Okay.
 So,
 um


let's
 talk
 about
 the
 tenure
 then.


Regional
 banks
 maybe
 not
 that
 big
 of
 an


issue.
 The
 10ear,
 this
 is
 something


you're
 really
 focused
 on,
 Chris.
 Why
 is


the
 tenure
 going
 below
 four
 such
 a
 big


deal
 for
 markets
 right
 now?


Uh,
 you're
 muted


there.
 It's
 a
 combination
 of
 things.


One,


it's
 a
 projection
 from
 the
 bond
 market,


and
 the
 bond
 market
 is
 much
 much
 bigger


than
 the
 equity
 market
 for
 for
 people


wondering.
 When
 the
 bond
 market
 starts


to
 buy
 a
 lot
 more
 bonds,
 there's
 two


reasons
 why.
 either
 they're
 they're


expecting
 inflation
 to
 be
 lower
 on,
 you


know,
 on
 a
 forward
 basis.
 So,
 when
 the


long
 bond
 starts
 to
 go
 south,


you
 know,
 people
 are
 not
 going
 to
 say


like,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 willing
 to
 accept,
 you


know,
 uh
 a
 4%
 interest
 rate
 if
 they
 can


get
 5%
 from
 the
 Treasury,
 right?"
 Um


unless
 they
 expect
 that
 within
 the
 next


two
 years,
 3
 years,
 the
 interest
 rates


on
 the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to
 be
 down
 to
 2%.
 in


which
 case
 now
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 like


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 the


the
 same
 return.
 So
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 now
 is
 number
 one
 people
 are


expecting
 less
 inflation
 more
 cuts
 right


so
 that's
 a
 simple
 reason
 why
 one
 it's


going
 down
 but
 the
 other
 reason
 why
 is


because
 if
 there's
 any
 fear
 in
 the


equity
 market
 people
 are
 going
 to
 run
 to


safety
 and
 treasuries
 are
 pretty
 good


yielders
 right
 now
 in
 terms
 of
 safety


you're
 getting
 right
 now
 almost
 4%


return
 pretty
 safe
 without
 having
 to
 to


do
 anything.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 one
 thing


that
 weirds
 me
 out
 a
 little
 bit
 in


seeing
 gold
 run
 up
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


treasuries
 are
 coming
 down.
 I
 mean


treasury
 yields
 are
 coming
 down


technically.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?
 Why
 is
 gold
 going


up?
 Why
 why
 are
 people
 buying
 gold
 and


treasuries
 at
 the
 same
 time?
 Because


that
 usually
 goes
 the
 opposite,
 right?


>> It
 would
 you
 would
 think
 so,
 right?
 Gold


going
 up
 means
 that
 people
 are
 expecting


um
 the
 debasement
 of
 the
 dollar.
 So


that's
 the
 trade
 that
 people
 have
 been


kind
 of
 making.
 But
 then
 if
 you
 look
 at


Bitcoin,
 Bitcoin
 is
 down
 today,
 right?


So
 what
 is
 it?
 Is
 Bitcoin
 not
 an


inflation
 hedge
 all
 of
 a
 sudden?
 It's


not
 a
 not
 a
 not
 a,
 you
 know,
 inflation.


>> Has
 it
 has
 it
 ever
 been
 an
 inflation


hedge
 or
 has
 it
 always
 been
 a
 way
 for


people
 to
 speculate?
 I
 mean,


>> well
 acted
 good
 during
 inflation.


>> That's
 the
 idea
 that
 it's
 supposed
 to


be,
 right?
 So
 on
 one
 hand,
 you're


starting
 to
 Well,
 technically
 on
 the


longer
 run,
 Bitcoin
 has
 outperformed
 the


dollar
 by
 miles.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 just
 gold
 has
 been
 recently
 doing


it.
 And
 I
 I
 suspect
 the
 reason
 is
 more


structural
 than
 than
 actual


fundamentals,
 which
 is
 um
 people
 are


ddollarizing,
 right?
 Like
 central
 banks


around
 the
 world
 are
 just,
 you
 know,


they're
 they're
 worried
 right
 now
 like


what
 is
 the
 dollar
 going
 to
 be
 worth?
 So


a
 lot
 of
 central
 banks
 are
 probably


buying
 dollars.
 I
 mean,
 uh
 buying
 gold


right
 now.
 So
 like
 China
 right
 now
 is


probably
 buying
 a
 the
 Chinese
 central


bank
 is
 probably
 buying
 a
 ton
 of
 gold.


And
 then
 there's
 also
 like
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 saw
 the
 post
 by
 Chicken
 Genius,


there's
 like
 lines
 of
 people
 buying
 gold


all
 of
 a
 sudden.
 So
 some
 of
 it's
 like


just
 mania,
 right?
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 that


that
 could
 also
 be
 another
 thing
 where


things
 can
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 speculative


in
 which
 case
 people
 are
 just
 dumping


cash
 into
 gold.
 So


>> okay.
 So
 this
 so
 so
 people
 are
 buying


gold
 as
 the
 inflation
 hedge,
 but
 they're


also
 buying
 the
 10-year
 because
 they


think
 inflation's
 coming
 down
 and
 they


want
 to
 lock
 in
 a
 good
 price.
 Like
 like


structurally,
 does
 that
 does
 that
 end
 up


boding
 well
 for
 equities?
 I
 guess
 is
 the


broader
 question.


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 the


treasuries
 have
 that
 gold
 doesn't
 have


is
 liquidity.
 You
 know,
 like
 what
 are


you
 going
 to
 do?
 Like
 all
 these
 people


standing
 in
 line,
 what
 are
 you
 going to


do?
 Buy
 a
 bar
 of
 gold
 and
 store
 it
 at


home?


>> Yeah.
 is
 that
 like
 and
 then
 how
 do
 you


cash
 out?
 Like
 how
 do
 you
 get
 how
 do
 you


sell
 it?
 So
 maybe
 consumers
 and
 central


banks
 can,
 you
 know,
 do
 their


shenanigans
 with
 gold,
 but
 most


businesses,
 they
 need
 liquidity
 and
 they


need
 liquidity
 fast.
 So
 they're
 not


going to
 be
 out
 there
 buying
 gold
 like


this
 or
 even
 gold
 futures
 for
 the
 most


part.
 They'll
 probably
 just
 stick
 to


treasuries
 and
 get
 a
 yield
 off
 of
 it.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 there's
 there's


room
 enough.
 The
 market's
 big.


>> Okay.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 becomes
 on


the
 equity
 markets.
 Did
 you
 buy
 the


>> So,
 one
 thing
 real
 quick.
 Someone
 said


chicken
 is
 selling,
 not
 buying.
 Yes,


Chicken
 Genius
 posted
 that
 those
 people


standing
 online
 are
 exit
 liquidity


basically.
 So,
 everyone's
 been
 buying


gold.


>> Yeah,
 everyone's
 been
 buying
 gold.
 Now,


silver
 is
 making
 a
 run
 for
 it.
 It's
 uh


and
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 RSI
 on
 gold


right
 now,
 it's
 in
 like
 the
 90s.
 It's


crazy.
 It's
 like
 gold
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


crowded
 trades
 right
 now.
 So,
 usually
 if


you
 want
 to
 be
 a
 contrarian,
 you
 go
 the


opposite
 direction
 of
 every
 everyone.


When
 everyone
 else
 is
 standing
 in
 line,


you
 figure
 out,
 okay,
 where
 can
 we
 go


from
 this?
 And
 everyone
 seems
 to
 be


bowled
 up
 on
 gold
 right
 now.
 So,
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'
 I'd
 be
 in
 gold.


Are


>> are
 you
 buying
 gold
 at
 all
 or
 No,


>> no.
 No.
 I
 I'm
 the
 traditional
 like
 buy


yield
 guy,
 you
 know?
 Like
 I
 I
 like


buying
 businesses
 that
 grow
 over
 time


and
 grow
 yields
 over
 time,
 not
 just,


hey,
 the
 next
 guy
 is
 going
 to
 buy
 my


shiny
 rock
 for
 more
 than
 I
 bought
 my


shiny
 rock
 for.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.


>> The
 only
 difference
 is
 there's
 consensus


around
 the
 world
 that
 gold
 sh
 the
 rocks


that
 are
 called
 gold
 are
 are
 valuable.


So
 everything
 runs
 on
 consensus.
 If


everyone
 thinks
 that
 a
 Mickey
 Mantel


card
 is
 worth
 a
 million
 dollars,
 then


it's
 worth
 a
 million
 dollars.
 If
 no
 one


thinks
 it's
 worth
 a
 million
 dollars,


then
 it's
 just
 a
 piece
 of
 paper
 with


with
 some
 guy
 on
 the
 on
 the
 the
 on
 the


card.


>> Well,
 the
 market
 cap
 today
 officially
 is


30
 trillion
 for
 gold.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,


equities
 next
 six
 months,
 what
 are
 you


thinking?
 We
 had
 rare
 earths
 that
 got


crushed
 today.
 Quantum
 got
 crushed


today.
 Nuclear
 stocks
 got
 crushed
 today.


Bitcoin
 miners
 got
 crushed
 today.
 Is


this
 a
 flushing
 out
 of
 froth
 or
 is
 this


a
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 some
 of
 these
 highf


flyers?


Um,
 I
 think
 some
 of
 it
 is
 just
 plain


fear
 that's
 kind
 of
 like
 making
 its
 way


into
 the
 market.
 And
 not
 to
 mention,


look
 at
 these
 companies,
 man.
 They've


had
 massive
 run-ups
 up
 till
 now.
 So,


some
 of
 it
 is
 just
 profit
 taking.
 You


know,
 some
 of
 it's
 fear
 of


overvaluation.


Some
 of
 it
 is
 just,
 hey,
 the
 technology


is
 probably
 BS.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 people


have
 made
 substantial
 gains.
 They're


going
 to
 want
 to
 take
 some
 profit,


right?
 So,
 I
 shorted
 uh
 CQITS
 today.
 I


did
 it
 via
 QBTZ


which
 was
 a
 good
 move
 in
 the
 morning


time.
 So


>> that
 was
 a
 great
 move
 in
 the
 morning.


You
 should
 be
 up
 like
 20%
 or
 something


on
 that.
 So


>> 10
 10
 because
 I
 didn't
 get
 I
 didn't
 get


it
 fast
 enough.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 okay.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 then


becomes
 if
 you
 think
 people
 are
 just


taking
 profits
 right
 here.
 Is
 there
 any


concern
 for
 the
 highf
 flyers
 to
 end
 out


Q4
 or
 do
 you
 think
 they
 consolidate
 even


if
 they
 go
 down
 another
 10%
 but
 they


still
 hold
 the
 majority
 of
 their
 gains?


I'm
 not
 too
 sure
 about
 like
 you'd
 have


to
 pick
 each
 one
 individually.
 Like
 with


regards
 to
 quantum,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 like


in
 either
 direction,
 right?
 I
 I
 think


the
 technology
 is
 probably
 legitimate,


but
 the
 use
 cases
 are
 like
 years
 away


like
 what's
 his
 name
 Scarelli
 saying.
 So


I
 agree
 with
 that.
 Um
 but
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 the
 the
 market
 isn't
 willing


to
 speculate.
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 AI


data
 centers.
 There's
 actual
 customers


that
 are
 coming
 out
 building
 things.
 So


that's
 a
 real
 tangible
 business.
 I
 don't


think
 that
 there's
 a
 real
 business
 with


quantum.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very


selective
 on
 which
 one
 do
 you
 think


that's
 actually
 real
 and
 which
 one
 is


not
 real.
 You
 know,
 and
 it's
 not
 to
 say


that
 quantum
 the
 technology
 is
 not
 real.


It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 out
 there
 that
 are
 real


technologies,
 but
 they're
 just
 not


monetizable
 because
 the
 use
 cases
 are


either
 so
 limited
 or
 or
 not
 worth
 it.


Like
 another
 thing
 is
 like
 uh
 same
 thing


with
 the
 the
 what
 is
 it they
 called
 the


rare
 earth
 minerals.
 While
 rare
 earth


minerals
 are
 very
 important
 for
 the


manufacturing
 process
 for
 you
 know
 high


technology.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 the
 total


total
 um
 worldwide
 market
 was
 for
 rare


earth
 minerals?


>> No.


>> It
 was
 like
 19
 billion
 last
 year.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.
 It
 wasn't
 like


>> you
 would
 think
 it's
 like
 hundreds
 of


You
 muted
 yourself.
 You
 would
 think
 it's


like
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 based
 on
 how


much
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 it,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 no,
 they're
 critical
 like
 in


terms
 of
 manufacturing,
 but
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 Uh
 total


market
 size.
 So,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


total
 market
 size,
 it's
 here
 it
 is
 one


second.
 Uh


let
 me
 just
 pull
 it
 up
 real
 quick.


Um
 Sashi,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 He


says,
 "Chris,
 do
 you
 expect
 gold
 to
 come


down
 in
 the
 next
 four
 months?
 I
 have
 to


buy
 nonetheless.
 Should
 I
 wait
 or
 should


I
 just
 buy
 now
 as
 it
 might
 never
 come


down?
 Well,
 Chris
 can
 answer
 that,
 but


I,
 you
 know,
 Chris
 is
 not
 buying
 gold


based
 on
 what
 he
 just
 said.


>> I
 I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 Gold
 is


gold
 is
 there's
 no
 fundamentals
 that


could
 tell
 you
 like,
 you
 know,
 where
 to


go
 on
 gold.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 couldn't


tell
 you.


>> I
 would
 say
 in
 general
 buying
 something


that's
 up
 70%
 on
 the
 year,
 like
 in
 10


years,
 maybe
 it
 works
 out,
 but
 if
 you're


doing
 it
 as
 a,
 you
 know,
 short-term


whatever,
 you
 you're
 buying
 something


that's
 run
 up
 a
 lot,
 which
 is
 hard.


Yeah.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 market
 like


like
 you
 know
 market
 for
 uh
 rare
 earths


it's
 not
 big


you
 know
 like
 I
 said
 they're
 very


important
 like
 the
 total
 market
 size
 for


rare
 earth
 estimate
 is
 about
 12
 to
 12.75


billion.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 could
 be
 37
 billion
 by
 2033.
 So


3x
 from
 here.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 not


exactly.
 Like,


>> do
 you
 think
 these
 got
 bit
 up
 for
 no


reason
 then?
 Or
 because
 you
 said
 they're


important,
 which
 they
 are.


>> So,
 like,


>> would
 you
 even
 think
 of
 buying
 the
 dip


on
 these
 or
 like
 no,
 because
 even


they're
 even
 though
 they're
 important,


the
 market
 application
 of
 them
 is
 not


enough
 to
 justify
 the
 runup.
 Yeah,
 I


think
 I
 think
 most
 of
 these
 projects
 are


going
 to
 require
 government
 support
 just


to
 break
 even,


>> you
 know,
 and
 not
 to
 mention
 the
 Chinese


have
 a
 way
 of
 kind
 of
 flooding
 the


market.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 almost
 like
 you


this
 thing
 is
 strategically
 important
 to


have,
 but
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 the


greatest
 business.
 You
 can't
 really


build
 a
 a
 great
 business
 around
 it,
 you


know,
 because
 the
 the
 the
 amount
 of


people
 that
 need
 it
 is
 a
 lot
 more


limited
 than
 people
 think.
 You
 know,


this
 is
 not
 one
 of
 those
 things
 like


steel
 or
 aluminum
 or
 something
 like
 or


copper
 where
 it's
 in
 almost
 everything.


This
 is
 very
 specific
 use
 cases
 and
 very


small
 amounts.
 So,
 yes,
 they're


critical,
 but
 they're
 not
 like
 it's
 just


not
 a
 business
 that
 you
 want
 to
 it's
 not


a
 growth
 business,
 you
 know,
 unless


you're
 very
 very
 early
 into
 like
 MP


materials
 or
 stuff
 like
 that,
 then
 yeah,


you
 could
 you
 could
 be
 in
 it,
 I
 suppose.


>> Are
 you
 at
 all
 concerned
 about
 capex?


We've
 seen
 these
 deals
 with
 Open
 AI
 and


AMD,
 Open
 AI
 and
 Oracle,
 Open
 AI
 and


Broadcom,
 Open
 AAI
 and
 Nvidia.
 Anthropic


said
 they're
 going to
 do
 26
 billion
 of


revenue
 next
 year.
 Like,
 are
 you
 feeling


any
 uneasiness
 around
 the
 state
 of
 the


AI
 capex
 trade
 or
 you
 think
 it's
 good
 to


go?


>> As
 of
 right
 now,
 no.
 I
 think
 there's


enough
 um
 there's
 enough
 data
 out
 there


that
 says
 demand
 is
 outpacing
 supply.


So,
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 I'm
 overly


overly
 concerned
 about.
 Whenever
 we
 see


like
 companies
 actually
 starting
 to
 pull


back
 on
 capex
 plans,
 then
 then
 there's


something
 that
 we
 have
 to,
 you
 know,


take
 into
 account.
 But
 as
 of
 right
 now,


every
 CEO
 is
 coming
 out
 saying,
 "Listen,


we've
 got
 more
 demand
 than
 we
 have


supply."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 just
 got
 to
 take
 them
 for
 their


word,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 I
 can't
 I
 can't


deny
 that.
 So,
 Novo's
 down
 5%,
 folks.
 We


got
 a
 Trump
 quote.
 He
 says,
 "I
 think
 the


fat
 loss
 drugs
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 lower
 in


price."


hymns
 is
 also
 down
 after
 hours.
 Let's


let's
 go
 back
 to
 Trump
 and
 see
 what
 he's


saying


>> because
 it
 was
 statute.
 It
 couldn't
 have


been
 earlier.
 I
 said,
 "Boy,
 this
 falls


into
 the
 next
 administration.
 I
 better


win."
 And
 all
 of
 a
 sudden,
 I
 watched


this
 Biden
 taking
 credit
 for
 something


that
 I
 did
 and
 uh
 on
 other
 things.
 So,


we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 kick
 in.
 So,
 the


nice
 part
 about
 this,
 this
 is
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 our
 administration.
 So
 I


think
 we're
 gonna
 see


>> was
 just
 indicted
 by
 a
 grand
 jury
 in


Maryland.
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 reaction
 to


that?


>> I
 didn't
 front
 of
 the
 line.
 We


>> That's
 great.


>> Why
 didn't
 I
 have
 him
 speak?
 He
 was
 so


could
 have
 saved
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 Thanks.


I'm
 not
 surprised.
 Yeah,
 please.


>> Yes.
 Thank
 you,
 Chris.
 Uh
 so
 Senate


Majority
 Leader
 John
 F
 today
 said
 he'd


like
 to
 proceed
 with
 the
 bill
 which


would
 put
 sanctions
 on
 Russia.
 What's


your
 thought
 on
 that?


>> Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 He
 doesn't


know
 about
 the
 call
 yet.
 I'm
 going
 to


speak
 to
 him
 later.
 And
 it
 was
 subject


to
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 we'll
 see


what
 happens.
 Uh
 we
 may
 have
 this
 may
 be


uh
 such
 a
 productive
 call
 that
 we're


going
 to
 end
 up
 we
 we
 want
 to
 get
 peace.


We
 want
 to
 stop
 the
 killing.


7,000
 people
 a
 week.
 Can
 you
 believe
 it?


We
 want
 to
 stop
 the
 killing.
 So
 uh
 I'm


going
 to
 speak
 to
 him
 and
 the
 speaker,


Mike
 Johnson.
 I'll
 speak
 to
 them
 a


little
 bit
 later
 and
 I'll
 tell
 them


about
 this
 and
 we'll
 make
 the
 right


determination.
 I'm
 not
 against
 anything.


I'm
 just
 saying
 uh
 it
 may
 not
 be
 perfect


timing.


>> It
 could
 happen
 in
 a
 week
 or
 two,
 but


it's
 at
 my
 option
 as
 you
 know,


>> right?
 But
 did
 President
 Putin
 try
 to


dissuade
 you
 from
 selling
 Tomahawk


missiles?


>> Well,
 of
 course,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 he's


going
 to
 say?
 Please
 sell
 tomahawks.


>> But
 did
 he
 say
 please
 sell
 those


tomahawks?
 I
 really
 appreciate
 it.


I
 did
 actually
 say,
 "Would
 you
 mind
 if
 I


gave
 a
 couple
 of
 thousand
 tomahawks
 to


your
 opposition?"
 I
 did
 say
 that
 to
 him.


I
 said
 it
 just
 that
 way.


>> He
 didn't
 like
 the
 idea.
 He
 really


didn't
 like
 the
 idea.
 No,
 I
 said
 it
 that


that
 way.
 Uh
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


lighthearted
 sometimes,
 but
 uh
 no,
 he


doesn't
 want
 to
 Tommahawk
 is
 a
 vicious


weapon.
 It's
 a
 vicious
 offensive,


incredibly
 destructive
 weapon.
 Nobody


wants
 to
 hook
 shot
 at
 him.


>> Ask
 you
 not
 to
 provide.


>> So
 wouldn't
 anybody?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been


in
 the
 news.
 Who
 wouldn't
 do
 that?
 CNN,


who
 wouldn't
 do
 that?
 You
 know,
 you


think
 he's
 going
 to
 sayward,


>> I'd
 love
 to
 have
 Tomah
 Hawk
 sent
 my
 way.


I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Maria,
 we
 have
 one
 of


the
 great
 stars
 of
 television
 here
 and


she's
 an
 incredible
 person
 and
 she's


just
 an
 amazing
 woman
 who
 she
 got
 it
 all


right.
 She
 got
 the
 Russia
 Russia
 Russia


hoax
 right.
 She
 got
 everything.
 Would


you
 have
 a
 question?
 Uh
 yes,
 Mr.


President,
 I
 would
 ask
 you
 why
 this
 was


so
 important
 to
 you.
 Uh
 IVF
 and
 why
 was


autism


>> for
 for
 babies,
 baby
 boys.
 It's
 one
 in


12.
 I
 heard
 one
 in
 10,
 Bobby.
 I
 heard


another
 one,
 you
 know,
 different
 lists.


But
 when
 you
 think
 of
 that,
 it's
 not


even
 sustainable.
 But
 there's
 something


artificial
 when
 that
 happens.
 That's
 not


like
 a
 natural.
 And
 then
 you
 have


certain
 groups
 of
 people
 that
 literally


don't
 have
 autism
 and
 they're
 not
 taking


some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we're
 taking.
 So


we're
 working
 very
 hard
 and
 or
 IVF.
 It's


just
 that
 I
 have
 friends
 including
 Katie


that
 called
 me
 and
 they
 told
 me
 the


importance
 of
 it.
 I
 wasn't
 that
 familiar


with
 it.
 Now
 I
 think
 I've
 sort
 of
 become


the
 father
 ever
 since
 I
 heard
 we
 there


was
 a
 bad
 decision
 in
 Alabama
 where
 a


judge
 wanted
 all
 clinics
 to
 be


immediately
 closed.
 Right.
 And
 Katie


called
 up
 and
 you
 said
 you
 were
 pretty


strongly
 attacked
 by
 your
 friends
 that


you
 didn't
 even
 know
 were
 involved
 with


IVF.
 Right.


>> You
 had
 people's
 that
 had
 grandkids,


people
 who
 had
 gone
 through
 IVF


themselves
 telling
 their
 story
 and


saying
 there
 are
 people
 out
 there.


>> Tell
 what
 you
 did
 when
 when
 you
 heard


from
 your
 friends,
 you
 said
 this
 was
 not


they
 almost
 became
 violent.


>> I
 told
 him
 I
 said
 Mr.
 President
 um
 we


need
 you.
 We
 need
 your
 voice
 in
 this


conversation.
 Um
 we
 we
 need
 the


directive.
 We
 need
 the
 strong
 support


because
 there
 are
 millions
 of
 people
 out


there,
 moms
 and
 dads,
 wanting
 to
 bring


life
 into
 the
 world.
 And
 you
 had
 people,


the
 chilling
 effect
 that
 occurred
 across


Alabama.
 There
 were
 people
 that
 were
 in


the
 middle
 of
 that
 process
 that
 had
 been


praying
 to
 have
 a
 child
 and
 that
 was


halted.
 And
 so
 the
 reality
 of
 that
 um


was
 very
 stark
 in
 our
 state.
 And
 so
 I


was
 able
 to
 tell
 the
 president
 some
 of


the
 stories
 of
 um
 people,
 you
 know,


friends
 and
 grandparents
 and
 uh


relatives
 that
 told
 me
 what
 they
 had


experienced
 and
 also
 um
 you
 know
 what


they
 were
 fearful
 of
 in
 the
 future.
 And


the
 president
 very
 quickly
 acted,
 spoke


with
 a
 strong
 voice
 and
 really
 led
 the


way.
 Um,
 obviously
 we
 saw
 Democrats


continue
 to
 fear-monger
 for
 the


remainder
 of
 the
 year,
 trying
 to
 use
 it


as
 an
 election
 issue
 when
 actually
 IVF


is
 legal
 and
 accessible
 in
 all
 50


states.
 And
 President
 Trump
 very
 clearly


said
 where
 he
 was
 on
 this
 and
 he
 said,


"I'm
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 this
 is


more
 accessible
 and
 that
 is
 more


affordable
 for
 families
 coast
 to
 coast."


That's
 exactly
 what
 he
 did.
 But
 it's


that
 real
 life,
 there's
 real
 life


stories,
 sir,
 that
 he
 responded
 to.
 And


that's
 what
 people
 don't
 know
 about
 him.


He
 cares
 and
 when
 you


>> Okay.


All right.
 So,
 I
 guess
 the
 uh
 main


comment
 we
 got
 is
 Trump's
 comment
 on


Russia
 and


that
 the
 weight
 loss
 drugs
 will
 be


coming
 down
 in
 price.
 Uh
 Chris,


geopolitical
 instability.
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 a
 concern
 for
 Q4
 or
 you
 think
 we're


getting
 to
 some
 level
 of
 peace?
 No,


>> I
 think
 we're
 This
 is
 all
 just
 back
 and


forth.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 like
 Liberation


Day
 part
 two.


where
 everyone's
 just
 kind
 of
 um
 number


one
 the
 markets
 run
 really
 hard.
 So
 one


people
 are
 not
 willing
 to
 just
 overlook


things.
 They're
 like
 hey
 you
 know what


maybe
 I
 should
 take
 some
 profit
 off
 the


table
 just
 be
 smart
 about
 it.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 some
 of
 it
 is
 just
 profit
 taking


and
 then
 also
 some
 of
 the
 comment
 that


Trump
 is
 making
 is
 kind
 of
 on
 one
 hand


it's
 hey
 we're
 going
 to
 fight
 a
 trade


war
 with
 China
 but
 then
 within
 like
 24


hours
 it's
 like
 yeah
 but
 we'll
 figure
 it


out.


>> We'll
 figure
 it
 out,
 right?


>> You
 know
 and
 you
 don't
 think
 the
 soybean


thing
 is
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal?


>> Not
 really.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 how


Trump
 negotiates,
 right?
 He's
 a
 tough


negotiator.
 So,
 he's
 just
 wants
 to
 keep


the
 other
 side
 guessing
 and
 that
 he
 said


that
 so
 many
 times
 like
 I
 just
 like
 to


keep
 the
 other
 side
 guessing
 and
 so
 I


think
 um
 going
 into
 trade
 negotiations


with
 China
 and
 some
 of
 the
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 Scott
 Bessant
 has
 said
 uh


representative
 uh
 trade
 representative


Greer
 has
 said
 you
 know
 they'll
 get
 to


their
 conclusion
 that
 they
 need
 to
 um


this
 whole
 thing
 remember
 it's
 a


mutually
 assured
 destruction
 we
 can't


blow
 up
 their
 economy
 without
 them


blowing
 up
 our
 economy
 you
 know
 Right.


And
 China
 did
 actually
 say
 today
 uh
 the


quote
 what
 from
 the
 foreign
 ministry
 was


decoupling
 from
 the
 US
 is
 not
 realistic


or
 rational.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean
 that's
 good
 to
 hear,
 right?
 It's


not
 like
 they're
 trying
 to
 say,
 "Yeah,


we
 don't
 need
 you
 guys
 anymore."
 And


it's
 a
 full-on
 isolated
 war
 between
 the


the
 two
 of
 them.
 They're
 like, "No,


we'll
 figure
 it
 out."


>> I
 have
 a
 theory,
 bro.
 I
 My
 theory
 is


Baron
 or
 President
 Trump
 has
 figured
 out


zero
 DTE
 options.
 Okay.
 and
 they're
 just


like,
 "What's
 going
 on
 today?"
 You
 know,


"Are
 my
 calls
 underwater?
 Yo,
 China,
 buy


our
 cooking
 oil
 or
 or
 whatever."
 And


boom,
 the
 market
 crashes.
 Like,
 woo,
 I'm


in
 the
 money
 again,
 you
 know.


>> No,
 but
 we're
 joking
 about
 it.
 But
 would


you
 put
 the
 odds
 at
 zero
 over
 someone


who's
 connected
 to
 someone
 in
 the


administration
 that's
 getting
 this


information
 ahead
 of
 time?
 I
 would
 say


the
 odds
 are
 greater
 than
 at least
 10%


on
 that.
 Dude,
 Eric
 Trump
 came
 out
 and


said
 they
 made
 a
 billion
 dollars
 on


crypto.


>> Yeah,
 he
 did
 say
 that.
 He
 did
 say
 that.


>> I
 mean,


come
 on.
 You're
 telling
 me
 that
 people


are
 on
 not
 at
 least
 somewhat
 in
 the
 know


about
 these
 things
 and
 making
 uh
 making


making
 some
 moves
 in
 the
 background?
 So,


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 guiding
 uh


Trump
 himself.
 I
 just
 think
 that
 some
 of


the
 some
 of
 the
 people
 around
 him
 could


be
 taking
 this
 using
 the
 information
 to


their
 advantage.
 I
 mean,
 imagine
 being


the
 guy
 who
 knows
 that
 Trump
 is
 about
 to


put
 out
 a
 tweet
 that's
 anti-China.


>> Yeah,
 we
 need
 to
 we
 need
 to
 get
 into


that
 network.


>> Well,
 that's
 that's
 a
 hard
 network
 to


get
 into.
 But
 if
 you
 if
 you
 know
 that


information
 and
 you
 can
 do
 it
 via


crypto,
 which
 is
 totally
 anonymous,
 I


mean,
 the
 guy
 made
 $200
 million
 on


Friday
 shorting
 Bitcoin
 because
 of
 that.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 interesting.
 Speaking
 of


crypto,
 Bitmine,
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 going


on
 with
 this?
 You
 got
 a
 price
 target
 of


$90
 from
 B
 Riley.
 Stocks
 been
 flat.


Ethereum's
 been
 kind
 of
 dead.
 I
 mean,
 is


your
 bullishness
 still
 up
 there?
 Or
 how


do
 you
 think
 the
 story
 plays
 out?


>> Hell
 yeah,
 dude.
 Hell
 yeah.
 Still


bullish
 on
 Ethereum.
 Bullish
 on
 stable


coins,
 bullish
 on
 Ethereum.
 There's
 just


too
 many
 um
 institutions
 that
 are


talking
 about
 building


on
 the
 blockchain
 and
 specifically
 level


two
 layer
 layer
 two
 and
 uh
 of
 uh


Ethereum
 and
 eventually
 that
 that
 uh


that
 ecosystem
 that's
 being
 built
 is


going
 to
 be
 worth
 something.
 So
 I'm
 in


definitely
 I'm
 in
 the
 Tom
 Lee
 uh
 I
 hate


I
 hate
 being
 in
 in
 Kathy
 Woods
 uh
 camp,


but
 I
 think
 she's
 right,
 bro.
 I
 I


anytime
 I
 hear
 Kathy
 Wood,
 I
 still


remember
 our
 debate
 on
 Roku,
 you
 know?


So,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 like
 be
 like,


"Oh,
 yeah,
 Kathy
 Wood
 knows
 what
 she's


doing."


>> You
 you
 defended
 Roku.
 You're
 like, "No,


I
 think
 she
 has
 a
 point
 here."


>> I
 did.
 See,
 and
 I
 was
 a
 [ __ ]
 for
 doing


it.
 So,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 Roku
 doing


these
 days
 anyway?
 I
 haven't
 even


checked.


>> It's
 still
 like
 number
 two
 in
 her
 fund.


Roku
 year
 to
 date
 is
 up
 30%.
 So,
 that's


helping.


>> Is
 it?
 There
 you
 go.
 So,
 maybe
 maybe


Kathy
 knows
 what
 she's
 doing.


>> Okay.
 So
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 on
 ETH.
 I'm


super
 bullish
 as
 well.
 But
 question
 is


about
 BMR.
 Do
 you
 still
 think
 a
 100red


by
 end
 of
 year
 is
 a
 possibility?


>> See
 that's
 the
 thing.
 I
 don't
 know
 how


how
 these
 guys
 are
 getting
 their
 price


targets.
 Like
 it's
 just
 I
 mean
 I
 know


how
 I'm
 getting
 a
 price
 target
 but
 then


like
 the
 assumptions
 that
 some
 like
 Tom


Lee
 is
 making
 are
 grounded
 in
 I
 don't


know
 pie
 in
 the
 sky
 numbers.
 Like
 I


think
 it
 was
 like
 oh
 I
 think
 he
 said
 he


thinks
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 not


Bitcoin
 Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 be
 between


10
 and
 12,000


and
 I
 think
 the
 way
 that
 he
 came
 to
 that


number
 was
 the
 gap
 between
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 closing.
 But
 then
 my
 question


was
 well
 then
 how
 do
 you
 know
 what
 the


value
 of
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 be?
 And


then
 he
 threw
 out
 a
 target
 like
 250,000


on
 Bitcoin.
 And
 I'm
 like
 okay.
 So,
 it's


not
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 don't
 trust
 his


numbers.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 there's
 a


methodology
 at
 work.
 I
 mean,
 unless
 he's


like
 publishing
 his
 numbers
 and
 saying


the
 reason
 why
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to


be
 worth
 this
 is
 because
 of
 X.
 So,
 the


best
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 um
 is
 just


hedge
 to
 the
 hedge
 your
 downside
 while


giving
 yourself
 a
 lot
 of
 room
 for


upside,
 you
 know,
 and
 if
 you
 can
 create


a
 strategy
 around
 that,
 you
 could,
 you


know,
 you
 could
 theoretically
 make
 a


really
 good
 return
 without
 putting
 up


too
 much
 risk.
 So,


>> okay.
 So,
 long
 term,
 we
 still
 believe
 in


ETH,
 just
 ultimately
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


question
 of
 the
 performance
 towards
 the


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 if
 if
 we
 get
 a
 Santa
 Claus


rally
 and
 the
 market
 gets
 like,
 you


know,
 like
 really
 happy
 again,
 which


definitely
 is
 the
 case.
 I
 think
 we
 have


another
 rally
 in
 Q4.
 Um,
 I
 think
 I
 think


ETH
 can
 get
 up
 there.
 you
 know,
 the
 75


in
 my
 opinion
 75
 is
 definitely
 possible


because
 I'm
 looking
 at
 realistically


like
 a
 5,500
 on
 Ethereum
 and
 then
 you


just
 do
 the
 math
 on
 it.
 6
 million


Ethereum
 outstanding
 500,
 you
 know,


multiply
 that
 out
 by
 uh
 5,500
 and
 then


you
 just
 divide
 up
 by
 the
 estimate


number
 of
 shares
 outstanding
 at
 the


time,
 which
 is
 ends
 up
 being
 close
 to


like
 550
 to
 575,
 which
 is
 the
 total


issuance.
 you
 got
 yourself
 $75,
 you


know,
 um
 with
 an
 MNAV
 of
 1.3
 1.4.
 The


only
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 um
 I
 would


caution
 people
 is


understand
 that
 the
 daily
 volume
 is


pretty
 sticky
 right
 now
 in
 terms
 of
 like


it's
 around
 50
 to
 70
 million,
 but
 the


number
 of
 shares
 outstanding
 is
 getting


bigger
 and
 bigger.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 harder
 to
 move
 it
 up
 and
 harder
 to


move
 it
 down.
 So,
 you're
 starting
 to
 get


this
 like
 gravity
 effect.
 And
 that's
 the


real
 question
 that
 I
 have
 is
 like
 unless


Ethereum
 starts
 to
 make
 massive
 moves
 to


the
 upside
 or
 massive
 moves
 to
 the


downside,
 the
 value
 of
 BMR
 is
 not
 going


to
 be
 moving
 as
 nearly
 as
 much,
 or
 at


least
 that's
 what
 I'm
 thinking.
 Um,
 in


which
 case
 the
 options
 market
 is
 totally


totally
 screwed
 up.
 In
 which
 case,
 you


can
 take
 advantage
 of
 that.
 So,
 if
 you


know
 how
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 that,
 then


take
 it.
 And
 if
 you
 don't,
 stay
 out
 of


the
 trade.


>> I
 agree.
 All right,
 so
 we
 got
 10
 minutes


left.
 Let's
 uh
 end
 it
 out
 with
 some
 Q&A.


Any
 questions
 for
 Chris?
 We'll
 do
 some


rapid
 fire.
 There
 is
 Chris's
 Twitter


right
 there.
 Please
 make
 sure
 to


subscribe.
 We
 did
 talk
 about
 gold
 for
 a


bit.
 if
 you
 rewind
 uh
 spend
 some
 time


talking
 about
 gold
 but
 any
 Q&A
 on


specific
 stocks
 macro
 concepts
 Chris


will
 try
 to
 answer
 it
 in
 whichever


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 best
 thing
 that
 I


can
 not
 like
 make
 a
 prediction
 but
 the


best
 thing
 I
 could
 say
 is
 I
 think
 we
 are


headed
 into
 a
 lower
 rate
 environment


next
 year
 like
 it's
 very
 it's
 very


obvious
 to
 me
 all
 the
 things
 that
 are


happening
 number
 one
 you've
 got
 shelter


rolling
 over
 number
 two
 you've
 got


energy
 prices
 like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 energy


price
 Last
 year
 they
 were
 like
 $75
 a


barrel
 for
 oil.
 Now
 it's
 like
 55
 56.
 So


ton
 of
 ton
 of
 movement
 towards
 a


disinflationary
 environment.
 You
 know


there's
 also
 fears
 around
 growth
 slowing


down.
 Then
 there's
 technology
 which
 is


super
 deflationary
 coming
 in.
 Jobs


market
 is
 cooling
 off.
 So
 all
 the
 all


the
 people
 that
 are
 like
 inflation


inflation
 inflation
 is
 going
 to


reacelerate
 just
 shut
 up
 relax.
 like


it's
 not.
 So,
 you
 know,


>> that
 doesn't
 even
 take
 into
 account
 AI


being
 deflationary.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 so
 many
 things
 that
 tell


me
 that.
 Like
 I
 said,
 everyone
 is


everyone
 is
 looking
 at
 like
 the
 1970s


and
 trying
 to
 like
 repeat
 that
 and
 say,


"Oh,
 look,
 we
 had
 a
 second
 bout
 of


inflation
 because
 like
 the
 first
 time
 we


didn't
 control
 it,
 blah
 blah."
 And
 I'm


like, "Yeah,
 but
 look
 at
 energy
 prices."


The
 one
 thing
 you
 got
 to
 give
 to
 Trump


is
 that
 dude,
 he's
 jawboning
 the
 hell


out
 of
 everyone
 and
 just
 making
 sure


that
 oil
 prices
 stay
 where
 stay
 at
 a


nice
 sustainable
 low
 level
 so
 that
 this


way
 inflation
 doesn't
 run
 rampid.
 So


yes,
 are
 there
 more
 input
 costs
 from


goods
 that
 are
 coming
 in
 from
 tariffs?


Absolutely.
 But
 then
 on
 the
 other
 hand,


you
 got
 aggregate
 demand
 destruction


from
 all
 the
 all
 the
 the
 deportations.


So
 population
 growth
 is
 going
 down.
 Uh


energy
 prices
 are
 much
 lower.
 So


logistics
 costs
 are
 down,
 right?
 Uh


credit
 now
 is
 starting
 to
 roll
 over.
 So


that's
 another
 thing.
 So
 you
 know,
 and


then
 and
 then
 you
 have
 all
 the
 liquidity


that's
 being
 pulled
 off
 of
 the
 consumer


from
 the
 government,
 which
 is
 no
 longer


doing
 housing
 moratoriums
 and
 rent
 rent


uh
 rent
 moratoriums
 and
 now
 people
 are


going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 more
 for
 their


health
 care
 because
 ACA


>> student
 loans,
 student
 loans
 are
 back


online.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 the
 consumer
 right


now
 is
 getting
 hit
 from
 every
 single


side.
 You're
 telling
 me
 that,
 hey,
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 out


there
 and
 spend
 more
 money.
 Like,
 no,


credit's
 tightening.
 Sorry,
 inflation's


not
 not
 not
 the
 problem
 that
 we
 have
 to


really
 worry
 about.
 And
 I
 think
 um


there's
 this
 video
 by
 Steven
 Moran
 if


you
 want
 to
 see
 something
 that
 just
 came


out
 today.
 I
 actually
 got
 it
 queued
 up.


Let
 me
 just
 put
 it.


Stephen
 Mirren,
 now
 Moran,
 sorry.


Jay
 Powell
 signaled
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 on


track
 for
 another
 move.
 Are
 you


expecting
 it's
 25
 basis
 points?
 Should


it
 be
 50?


Yeah.
 Well,
 my
 view
 is
 that
 it
 should
 be


50.
 However,
 I
 expect
 it
 to
 be
 an


additional
 25.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 that


we're
 probably
 set
 up
 for
 for
 for
 three


25
 basis
 point
 cuts
 this
 year
 for
 a


total
 of
 75
 basis
 points
 this
 year.
 Uh,


you
 know,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 look,
 it


would
 be
 really
 helpful
 to
 have
 the


economic
 data
 in
 order
 to
 be
 able
 to


make
 the
 decisions
 we
 need
 to
 make.
 Uh,


certainly
 we
 would
 want
 to
 be
 inspecting


the
 economy
 for
 signs
 of
 for
 signs
 of


moves
 lower
 in
 inflation,
 for
 signs
 of


changes
 in
 the
 job
 market.
 But
 without


those
 data,
 we
 still
 have
 to
 make
 a


decision
 anyway.
 And
 so
 we'll
 have
 to


rely
 upon
 our
 forecasts
 for
 doing
 so.


>> And
 and
 what
 did
 you


>> Okay,
 cool.
 So
 we
 we
 we
 heard
 him


yesterday
 on
 CNBC
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 he
 is


the
 most
 bullish
 out
 of
 all
 the
 other


Fed
 presidents.
 The
 question
 is
 just
 if


we'll
 actually
 get
 three
 cuts.
 Um
 Okay,


let's
 do
 some
 rapid
 fire
 on
 some
 stocks.


So
 Chris,
 you
 you've
 talked
 about
 VG


over
 and
 over
 again.
 So
 just
 quick


thoughts
 on
 this.
 Are
 you
 buying
 the
 dip


or
 you
 just
 holding
 steady
 on
 this?


>> Yeah,
 longterm
 great
 business
 generates


cash.


>> Cool.
 Uh
 woman.
 Yeah.


>> Irene,
 are
 you
 touching
 this
 one?


>> Not
 really.
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 much


about
 the
 business,
 so
 I
 couldn't
 tell


you.
 Uh,
 that's
 Sam.
 Sam
 has
 been


talking
 about
 that.
 I
 don't
 know
 much


about
 it.
 So,


>> okay.
 Do
 you
 still
 have
 as
 bro?


>> I
 do.
 I
 do.


>> You're
 not
 taking
 profits
 here?
 I
 mean,


>> no,


>> bro.
 This
 thing
 is
 up.
 Like,


>> no.
 And
 if
 if
 uh
 you
 want
 to
 know


something,
 I'm
 going
 super
 long
 on


Verizon.
 See?


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 you're
 doing
 you're


doing
 both
 together.


>> That's
 right.
 Telecom,
 baby.
 That's


where
 you
 want
 to
 be.


>> I'm
 surprised
 you're
 not
 selling
 your


ESTs.
 You
 were
 that
 convicted
 that
 you


were
 choosing
 to
 hold
 on.


>> It's
 the
 easiest
 business
 model
 to


understand.
 It's
 literally
 se
 sell


towers
 in
 space.


Like,


>> all right.
 There
 you
 go.


>> Sell
 towers
 in
 space,
 dude.
 They
 get


fixed
 fees
 that
 are
 contracted
 down.
 I


mean,
 Bell
 can
 Verizon
 just
 had
 that


deal
 with
 them.
 Bell
 Canada
 is
 talking


about
 it's
 it's
 a
 great
 business
 model.


You
 know,


>> uh
 Amazon,
 are
 you
 a
 buyer?


>> I'm
 going
 to
 let
 it
 uh
 come
 down
 a


little
 bit
 more.
 Uh
 mainly
 because


Amazon's
 got
 two
 major
 headwinds.
 One,


it's
 AWS
 business.
 It's
 still
 growing,


but
 it's
 losing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 steam


compared
 to
 GCP
 and
 Azure.
 And
 people


are
 worried
 about
 the
 consumer,
 which


you
 know,
 Amazon,
 that's
 a
 core


business.
 So,
 you
 know,
 people
 are
 like,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 in
 this
 too


much.
 So,
 yeah,
 but
 it
 is
 it's
 trading


for
 a
 really
 good
 value.


>> Yeah,
 especially
 on
 a
 EV
 to
 eBay
 basis.


I
 would
 agree.
 Nebas
 and
 Corwe,
 would


you
 touch
 any
 of
 those
 right
 here
 or
 No,


>> it's
 not
 my
 forte,
 man.
 That's
 all
 Sam.


Sam
 is
 like
 there
 are
 certain
 there's


certain
 um
 industries
 that
 I
 think
 other


people
 have
 done
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


covering
 and
 Sam
 has
 done
 the
 deep
 dive


and
 all
 all
 of
 Nebius's
 business


segments
 and
 data
 centers
 and
 all
 that


stuff.
 So
 I've
 kind
 of
 just
 like


substituted
 my
 my
 own
 research
 to
 him


and
 just
 if
 he
 tells
 me
 it's
 good,
 it's


good.
 If
 it's
 not
 good,
 it's
 not
 good.


So
 you
 know,
 we'll
 just
 go
 based
 I'll


just
 I
 would
 just
 say
 caution
 against


listening
 to
 me
 about
 it.
 Just
 ask


someone
 like
 Sam.


>> UNH
 continue
 to
 hold.


>> Uh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 UNH
 is
 good.
 Recession


resistant.
 So
 if
 we
 do
 get
 any
 weakness,


they'll
 do
 good.
 Um
 they've
 also
 got
 a


massive
 amount
 of
 debt
 on
 the
 balance


sheet
 that
 they
 can
 manage,
 but
 their


debt
 um
 you
 know,
 if
 interest
 rates
 come


down,
 it's
 easier
 to
 finance
 it.
 So


yeah,
 UNH
 is
 fine.
 They've
 got
 they've


got
 to
 deal
 with
 some
 uh
 regulatory


changes
 that
 from
 the
 Biden
 era
 that


they're
 hopefully
 going
 to
 get
 their


hands
 around.
 But
 one
 thing
 you're
 going


to
 start
 to
 see
 is
 premiums.
 If
 people


here
 haven't
 already
 saw
 some
 of
 what


the
 premiums
 are
 going
 to
 be
 looking


like
 for
 not
 just
 for
 United
 Healthcare,


if
 you
 have
 that
 health
 insurance,
 but


any
 health
 insurance,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 higher
 next
 year.
 So,
 just
 letting


you
 all
 know
 right
 now,
 better
 save
 up.


Is
 is
 Oscar
 a
 play
 on
 the
 eventual


capitulation
 of
 this
 shutdown
 or
 do
 you


think
 that
 one
 could
 get
 wrecked
 easily


if
 it's
 not
 favored?


>> No,
 I
 think
 it'll
 do
 I
 could
 I
 think
 I


think
 at
 this
 point
 the
 ACA
 subsidy


extensions
 are
 almost
 a
 guarantee.
 Like


it's
 way
 too
 important
 for
 the


Republicans
 uh
 to
 have
 the
 ACA
 because


there's
 just
 so
 many
 members
 that
 in


their
 local
 districts
 that
 are
 utilizing


the
 ACA
 subsidies.
 Now,
 this
 is


something
 that
 Marjorie
 Taylor
 Green


said,
 which
 actually
 made
 a
 lot
 more


sense.
 She's
 like, "Look,
 we
 can
 talk


about
 getting
 rid
 of
 these
 subsidies,


but
 we
 can't
 do
 it
 cold
 turkey,
 right?


We
 can't
 just
 say,
 "Hey,
 get
 used
 to


these
 subsidies
 for
 the
 last
 5
 years
 and


then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 be
 like,
 yeah,
 you


know
 what?
 Now
 you
 got
 to
 stand
 on
 your


two
 legs."


>> Like,
 no,
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 give


people
 an
 offramp.
 And
 especially
 while


inflation
 and
 uh
 uh
 has
 basically


wrecked
 a
 lot
 of
 people's
 bal,
 you
 know,


um
 uh
 finances
 over
 the
 last
 two
 three


years,
 you
 got
 to
 get
 people
 a
 chance
 to


adjust.
 So,


>> are
 you
 buying
 next
 decade?


>> Uh
 not
 really.
 I'
 I've
 already
 got
 too


much
 exposure
 to
 next
 decade.
 So,
 next


decade
 in
 venture
 global
 I
 have
 in


spades.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 really
 going
 to
 add


to
 it.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 own
 it,
 but
 you're
 not


adding
 more.
 Gotcha.


>> No.


Um,


all
 right.
 I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much


it.
 Is
 there
 any
 stocks
 that
 are
 on
 your


radar
 that
 you
 would
 think
 people
 should


look
 at?
 Any
 broader
 concepts
 or
 just


rates
 coming
 down
 should
 be
 a
 tailwind


long
 term?


>> I
 think
 people
 need
 to
 look
 at
 yields.


Yields
 is
 where
 I
 would
 focus
 on
 next


year.
 So,
 number
 one,
 the
 valuation
 on


the
 S&P
 is
 really,
 really
 high,
 which


means
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 people


who
 want
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 move
 into
 a


little
 bit
 of
 safety.
 2026
 is
 also
 a


midterm
 year.
 Uh
 those
 are
 not
 usually


very
 very
 delightful
 for
 the
 market.


>> Those
 are
 actually
 horrible
 years
 for


the
 market
 to
 be
 honest.
 They're
 not


good
 years
 at
 all.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in


safety
 and
 so
 there
 are
 companies
 out


there
 that
 have
 really
 good
 safety


profiles
 from
 cash
 flow
 perspective
 that


you
 want
 to
 look
 at
 and
 then
 you
 want
 to


look
 at
 the
 yields
 that
 you
 could
 get.


So
 on
 average
 the
 S&P
 yields
 between


seven
 and
 9%
 every
 year
 for
 the
 last
 you


know
 however
 many
 years.
 Um
 the
 only


thing
 is
 it
 also
 really
 depends
 on
 the


entry
 price.
 So
 if
 you
 enter
 at
 the


wrong
 time
 when
 valuations
 are
 super


high
 you're
 almost
 guaranteed
 to


underperform
 the
 market
 long
 term.
 So


it's
 a
 good
 idea
 right
 now
 in
 my
 opinion


if
 rates
 are
 projected
 to
 come
 down
 to


lock
 in
 those
 yields
 now.
 Right.
 So


there
 are
 dividend
 companies
 out
 there


right
 now
 that
 are
 doing
 se
 seven%
 in
 I


mean
 7%
 dividends
 qualified
 7%
 dividends


that
 you
 know
 for
 someone
 who's
 done


really
 really
 well
 this
 year
 you
 want
 to


take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 money
 off
 the
 top


you
 know
 like
 put
 it
 into
 some
 safe


industries
 that's
 where
 you
 want
 to
 look


you
 know
 and
 that's
 where
 I'm
 looking


anyway
 so


uh
 someone
 said
 UPS
 and
 Verizon
 dividend


monster
 so
 UPS
 I
 am
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of


only
 because
 they're
 unionized
 at
 this


point.
 And
 so
 anytime
 they
 make
 a
 little


bit
 more
 money,
 the
 union
 kind
 of
 just


says,
 "Hey,
 I
 want
 more
 money.
 Give
 me


more
 money."
 You
 know,
 so
 definitely
 not


a
 UPS
 um
 UPS
 guy.
 But
 Verizon's
 good.


Verizon,
 you
 know,
 economy
 goes
 down.


What
 do
 you
 think?
 People
 going
 to


cancel
 their
 cell
 phone
 plans?
 No.
 Yeah.


And
 then
 uh
 there's
 also
 this
 general


trend
 that's
 happening
 with
 a
 lot
 of


people
 switching
 over
 from
 cable
 to


fixed
 wireless
 broadband
 access.
 That's


a
 tailwind
 for
 these
 guys.
 And
 then
 when


you
 look
 at
 their
 credit
 profiles,
 they


have
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,


but
 the
 debt
 is
 manageable
 because
 of


their
 strong
 cash
 flows.
 But
 at
 the


other
 end
 of
 it,
 if
 you
 cut
 interest


rates,
 the
 debt
 servicing
 becomes


cheaper.
 They
 just
 got
 a
 new
 CEO.
 And


there's
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 due
 diligence


that
 I've
 done
 on
 Verizon.
 And
 so
 I'm


I'm
 actually
 I've
 been
 building
 a


position
 in
 Verizon.
 I
 actually
 took


another
 bigger
 chunk
 today
 as
 well.
 So


yeah.


Okay,
 there
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 joining.
 This
 was
 our
 third
 Macro


Thursday
 with
 Mr.
 Chris
 Patel.
 I'm


putting
 his
 Twitter
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat


and
 we'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
 See
 what


happens
 for


>> later,
 guys.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.


>> Later,
 Chris.
 Thank
 you.
 Appreciate
 you.


Later.
 Later.


All
 right,
 folks.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 the


day.
 We
 are
 done.
 Um,
 tomorrow's
 Friday.


I'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 market


open.
 We'll
 have a
 daily
 recap
 in
 a


couple
 hours.
 Uh,
 talk
 more
 about
 the


regional
 bank
 stuff
 on
 that
 daily
 recap.


So,
 we'll
 get
 into
 that.
 Look,
 in


general,
 I
 I
 personally
 don't
 think


Zions
 and
 Western
 Alliance
 are
 creating


some
 structural
 problem
 with
 credit
 in


the
 United
 States,
 but
 that's
 how
 the


market's
 reacting.


And
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 market's
 going
 to


react
 like
 that,
 then
 the
 market's
 going


to
 react
 like
 that.
 But
 there's
 not
 much


we
 can
 do
 until
 that
 is
 kind
 of


resolved.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 quote
 from
 Trump


on
 uh
 well
 on
 beef.


It's
 such
 a
 big
 category.
 Everything


follows.
 So
 just
 about
 everything


follows.
 And
 we
 are
 working
 on
 beef
 and


I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 deal
 on
 beef
 that's


going
 to
 bring
 the
 price
 of
 beef.
 That


would
 be
 the
 one
 one
 product
 that
 we


would
 say
 is
 uh
 a
 little
 bit
 higher
 than


we
 want
 it.
 Maybe
 higher
 than
 we
 want


it.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 coming
 down


pretty
 soon,
 too.
 We
 did
 something.
 We


worked
 our
 magic.
 But
 groceries
 are
 down


and
 energy
 is
 down.
 Electricity
 is
 way


down.
 Uh
 we
 have
 the
 prices
 coming
 down


for
 people.
 They
 were
 they
 were
 abused


for
 four
 years
 by
 the
 Biden


administration.
 Uh
 thank
 you
 very
 much


everybody.
 We'll
 see
 you
 soon.
 Thank


you.


>> For
 the
 IRS.


Okay.
 Beef.
 Are
 there
 beef
 futures?
 No,


there's
 cattle
 futures.
 Are
 they
 green?


Are
 cattle
 futures
 green
 right
 now?


They're
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Cattle
 futures


are
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


deal
 we
 got
 on
 beef,
 but
 Steve
 is
 going


to
 like
 this.
 Yeah,
 Steve's
 going
 to


love
 it.
 Steve
 is
 gonna
 love
 it.
 There


you
 go.
 Cattle
 futures


up
 point4%.


All
 right,
 speaking
 of
 Steve,
 I'll
 be


live
 on
 Steve's
 channel
 at
 9:30.
 We're


gonna
 do
 something
 every
 Thursday.
 So,


uh,
 9:30
 to
 10:30,
 we'll
 just
 chop
 it
 up


about
 markets,
 whatever.
 Steve
 will


probably
 be
 on,
 uh,
 after
 10:30
 just


talking
 with
 you
 guys,
 but
 I'll
 be
 with


him
 usually
 on
 Thursdays
 and
 we'll
 start


the
 first
 one
 of
 those
 today.


And
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.


Then
 we'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
 Uh,
 Dunce,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 right
 here.


Ash,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member.
 Karen,
 thank
 you
 as
 well
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 Dun
 says,


"Uh,
 this
 is
 the
 last
 market
 open
 for


me.
 I
 got
 a
 job
 starting
 Monday,
 so
 I


can't
 be
 here
 during
 the
 day."
 Love
 you


though.
 Dunce,
 appreciate
 you,
 man.


Congrats
 on
 the
 job.
 The
 job
 is
 way
 more


important
 than
 being
 here
 watching
 every


day.
 So,
 hopefully
 you
 can
 catch
 the


daily
 recap
 and
 get
 caught
 up
 on


everything,
 but
 appreciate
 you
 being


here.
 And
 congrats
 on
 the
 job
 as
 well.


Um,
 all
 right,
 I
 think
 we're
 done.


That
 is
 pretty
 much
 it.
 We'll
 be
 back


again


tomorrow
 morning.
 Can't
 believe
 it's


Friday,
 bro.
 This
 was
 a
 quick
 week.
 This


one
 felt
 like
 an
 It
 felt
 like
 it
 was


slow,
 but
 it
 was
 really
 quick.


Particularly
 because
 we
 were
 up
 on


Monday,
 recovered
 from
 Friday,
 down
 on


Tuesday,
 up
 on
 Wednesday,
 down
 in
 day,


then
 we
 were
 up
 today,
 then
 we
 went
 down


today
 with
 the
 whole
 regional
 bank


thing.
 And
 so,
 I
 guess
 we'll
 see
 how
 we


end
 this
 out
 on
 Friday.
 Ryan
 says,
 "Bro,


just
 watch
 at
 work."
 Okay,
 not
 everyone


can
 just
 put
 in
 their
 earphones
 and
 not


do
 anything
 at
 work
 like
 some
 of
 you


guys.
 I
 say
 that
 because
 I
 used
 to
 be


one
 of
 those
 people
 that
 like
 not
 not


work
 per
 se,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 clients
 that


I
 had
 that
 I
 would
 consult
 with
 like


there'd
 be
 there
 would
 be
 some
 hours


where
 I'd
 be
 like,
 "Dude,
 I'm
 checked


out.
 I'm
 not
 doing
 [ __ ]
 right
 now.
 I'm


just
 because
 if
 you
 get
 your
 work
 done


within
 like
 an
 hour
 and
 you're
 on
 you're


on
 the
 the
 docket
 for
 four
 hours.
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 three
 hours
 left.
 Like


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do?
 Like
 you're


going
 to
 do
 more
 work?"
 No,
 you're
 not


getting
 paid
 for
 more
 work.
 You're


getting
 paid
 for
 is
 the
 same
 amount
 of


work
 that
 you
 finished
 because
 you
 were


an
 efficient
 worker.


Philip
 says,
 "I
 feel
 seen."


That's
 what
 happens,
 bro.
 That's
 what


happens.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 All right.
 I'll
 be
 back


tomorrow.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 uh


I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 Yeah.
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 else.
 I


mean,
 we'll
 have
 the
 daily
 recap
 out,


but
 I
 think
 this
 regional
 thing
 was
 an


issue.
 We'll
 see
 if
 it
 continues
 to
 be


an
 issue,
 but
 if
 it's
 not,
 then
 we


should
 be
 good
 to
 go.
 We
 work
 for
 our


portfolios.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Let
 me


link
 Steve's
 channel
 for
 those
 that


don't
 have
 it.
 Uh,
 deep
 dive
 will
 be


coming
 out
 tomorrow.
 So,
 again,
 if
 you


want
 to
 subscribe
 to
 the
 Substack,
 I'll


put
 it
 right
 there.
 There's
 Steve's
 Oh,


I
 gave
 you
 his
 Twitter,
 but
 I'll
 put
 up


his
 YouTube.
 And
 I'll
 be
 on
 with
 him


at
 9:30
 today.
 9:30.


and
 then
 we'll
 be
 done.


And
 then
 the
 Substack
 link
 that
 is
 right


here.


All
 right,
 that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Means
 the


world.
 Tooth
 is
 doing
 really
 good.
 I


actually
 have
 a
 checkup
 with
 the
 dentist


on
 October
 28th,
 the
 day
 after
 my


birthday.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to
 leave


the
 market
 open
 a
 little
 early
 that
 day,


but
 it
 is
 after
 the
 market
 open,
 which


is
 a
 good
 thing.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 the
 tooth


is
 going
 good
 and
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 All
 right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


tomorrow.
 on
 the
 market
 opens.
 See
 you


later
 tonight
 on
 Steve's
 show
 and
 daily


recap
 out
 in
 a
 few
 hours.
 Bye
 everyone.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
