[Music]


hello
 uh
 good
 evening
 uh
 welcome
 it's
 a


full
 house
 it's
 great
 to
 see
 all
 of
 you


here
 uh
 at
 lbs
 we
 always
 start
 on
 time


uh
 my
 name
 is
 Sergey
 guif
 I'm
 a
 dean
 of


uh
 London
 business
 school
 and
 I
 will
 not


take
 much
 of
 your
 time
 because
 of
 course


you're
 here
 to
 uh
 hear
 from
 our
 today's


tonight's
 guest
 uh
 Nikolai
 tangin
 who
 is


managing
 the
 largest
 uh
 Sovereign
 wealth


Fund
 in
 this
 world
 uh
 Nord
 G
 bank's


Investment
 Management
 um
 this
 is
 the


fund
 which
 has
 something
 like
 1.5


percentage
 point
 of
 all
 listed
 equity
 in


this
 world
 so
 today
 or
 you
 may
 say


starting
 last
 Friday
 but
 actually


starting
 many
 years
 ago
 this
 uh
 this


fund
 uh
 has
 been
 invested
 in
 companies


which
 go
 up
 and
 down
 right
 and
 to


especially
 in
 today's
 environment
 but


the
 fund
 is
 investing
 in
 companies
 which


are
 affected
 by
 many
 uh
 interesting


developments
 especially
 those
 in
 recent


weeks
 we
 of
 course
 would
 like
 to
 hear


from
 niik
 how
 the
 fund
 how
 he
 as
 a
 CEO


of
 the
 fund
 thinks
 about
 uh
 investing
 in


those
 uh
 challenging
 times
 now
 Nikolai


also
 has
 his
 own
 podcast
 which
 I'm
 sure


all
 of
 you
 have
 listened
 to
 where
 he


shares
 wisdom
 but
 also
 asks
 uh
 CEOs
 of


uh
 global
 companies
 uh
 that
 the
 uh
 fund


is
 invested
 in
 he
 also
 is
 very
 open


sharing
 his
 advice
 in
 op
 ads
 the
 recent


opad
 in
 financial
 times
 for
 example
 was


talking
 about
 uh
 the
 importance
 of


shortterm
 uh
 reporting
 and
 the


importance
 of
 long-term
 thinking
 so


there
 are
 many
 things
 that
 I'm
 sure
 uh


we
 will
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 talk
 about


today
 um
 uh
 this
 is
 I
 should
 say
 a
 part


of
 summit
 series
 of
 uh
 uh
 our
 Institute


for
 entrepreneurship
 and
 private
 Capital


where
 we
 bring
 in
 uh
 outstanding


speakers
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 most


challenging
 decisions
 and
 issues
 uh
 in


in
 in
 their
 in
 their
 distinguished


careers
 and
 with
 that
 I
 would
 like
 to


invite
 the
 director
 of
 The
 Institute


Professor
 Floren
 vasvari
 to
 the
 stage


and
 Nikolai
 uh
 and
 they
 will
 have
 a


fireside
 chat
 uh
 with
 you
 please


[Applause]


thank
 you
 hopefully
 you
 can
 hear
 me
 yes


it's
 it's
 working
 very
 good
 excellent


how
 many
 Norwegians
 do
 we
 have
 here


today
 hands
 up
 wow
 okay
 that's
 good


there
 you


go


excellent
 excellent
 so
 uh
 thank
 you
 all


for
 coming
 on
 time
 and
 for
 taking


pictures
 it's
 allowed
 to
 take
 pictures


so
 feel
 free
 to
 do
 so
 uh
 we
 will
 make


sure
 we
 smile
 so
 uh
 we
 appreciate
 you


coming
 on
 time
 and
 we
 appreciate


appreciate
 so
 many
 of
 you
 coming
 this
 is


quite
 unusual
 for
 us
 uh
 we
 we
 typically


run
 these
 events
 in
 much
 you
 know
 with
 a


much
 smaller
 audience
 but
 Nikolai
 is
 uh


so
 popular
 I'm
 almost
 learning
 now
 that


uh
 the
 number
 of
 speakers
 is
 a
 function


of
 uh
 the
 assets
 and
 the
 management
 or


maybe
 some
 there's
 some
 causal
 effect


here
 somehow
 so
 thank
 you
 for
 coming
 so


today's
 session
 is
 really
 about


understanding
 the
 largest
 Fund
 in
 the


world
 as
 uh
 Serge
 was
 saying


the
 fund
 the
 Nord
 Bank
 investment


management
 is
 the
 the
 management
 arm
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Central
 Bank
 that
 manages


the
 fund
 is
 the
 government
 pension
 plan


actually
 the
 fund
 is
 now
 1.8
 trillion


dollar
 the
 last
 time
 I
 checked
 at
 least


and
 has
 been
 set
 up
 in


1996
 and
 since
 1996
 this
 has
 done
 uh


incredibly
 well
 compounded
 returns
 at


about


6.30%
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 Nikolai


has
 been
 appointed
 to
 run
 this
 fund
 5


years
 ago
 in
 September


2020
 so
 maybe
 we
 can
 start
 by
 um
 Nikolai


maybe
 you
 can
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about


the
 fund
 maybe
 the
 governance
 structure


so
 that
 we
 all
 understand
 it
 here
 I
 did


some
 research
 myself
 and
 I
 I
 can


definitely
 say
 that
 amongst
 all
 the


Sovereign
 wealth
 funds
 uh
 your
 fund
 is


the
 most
 transparent
 by
 far
 okay
 it's
 is


really
 transparent
 everything
 is
 on
 the


website
 but
 maybe
 you
 can
 tell
 us
 a


little
 bit
 about
 the
 fund
 in
 terms
 of


numbers
 today
 and
 and
 maybe
 how
 you


found
 it
 5
 years
 ago
 when
 you
 joined


sure
 um
 I
 think
 to
 understand
 the
 fund


you
 need
 to
 go
 all
 the
 back
 to
 all
 the


way
 back
 to
 1969
 where
 where
 they
 were


drilling
 for
 oil
 outside
 the
 coast
 of


Norway
 and
 on
 the
 very


last
 uh
 well
 they
 found
 oil
 if
 it
 hadn't


found
 oil
 then
 they
 would
 have
 packed
 up


the
 toys
 and
 gone
 home
 and


um
 this
 was
 announced
 to
 the
 Norwegian


people
 the
 day
 before
 Christmas
 Eve


1969
 and
 then
 you
 can
 say
 wow
 what
 a


Christmas
 gift
 but
 the
 thing
 was
 that
 in


many
 countries
 it
 had
 been
 a
 curse
 to


find
 uh
 such
 wealth
 it
 had
 led
 to


corruption
 uh
 to
 crowding
 out
 of


Industries
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 that's
 when


the
 Norwegian
 politicians
 decided
 to


make
 it
 into
 a
 fun
 so
 in
 '96
 they
 made


the
 first
 deposit
 into
 the
 fund
 two


billion
 Norwegian
 Groner
 and
 that's


grown
 to
 roughly
 20,000
 billion
 now
 um


so
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 take
 the
 wealth
 from


the
 Shelf
 move
 it
 into
 Financial
 assets


and
 now
 we
 made
 twice
 as


much
 uh
 uh
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 returns
 in


financial
 markets
 compared
 to
 the
 money


we
 put
 into
 the
 fund
 so
 in
 a
 way
 we


found
 oil
 twice
 on
 the
 Shelf
 in


financial


markets
 we
 are
 700
 people
 around
 the


world
 so
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 small
 team


okay
 so
 I
 call
 us
 the
 national


moneymaking


team
 um
 and
 and
 um
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 it's


a
 big
 honor
 to
 work
 in
 that
 firm
 because


what
 we
 do
 is
 to
 uh
 take
 care
 of
 the


money
 and
 the
 money
 now
 provides
 one
 out


of
 five
 Hospital
 School


Road
 more
 than
 20%
 of
 the
 budget
 is


financed
 by
 this


fund
 the
 way
 it's
 run
 it's
 uh
 uh
 run


according
 to
 a
 mandate
 that
 we
 are
 given


from
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Finance
 so
 the


ministry
 is
 very
 very
 important
 and
 uh


they
 have
 made
 this
 mandate
 and
 we
 are


pretty
 close
 we're
 investing
 close
 to


that
 mandate
 so
 it's
 a
 relatively
 index


near
 fund
 and
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 be


pretty
 index
 near
 when
 you
 when
 you
 are


of
 such


importance
 uh
 to
 the


country
 what
 else
 okay
 and


definitely
 this
 is
 not
 just
 an
 index


fund
 is
 a
 you
 do
 have
 you
 augment
 this


with
 some
 selective
 active
 management


yeah
 we
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 that
 as
 well


so
 so
 just
 just
 a
 couple
 more
 things
 you


mentioned
 that
 it's
 a
 very
 transparent


fund
 it's
 the
 most
 transparent
 Fund
 in


the
 world
 okay
 yeah
 now
 how
 can
 I
 say


that
 well
 there
 is
 actually
 a
 world


championship
 in


transparency
 historically
 It
 Was
 Won
 by


the
 Canadians
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 it's


okay
 to
 be
 beaten
 by
 Canadians
 in
 ice


hockey
 but
 it's
 not
 okay
 to
 be
 beaten
 in


transparency
 so
 we
 decided
 we're
 going


to
 win
 this
 and
 we
 work
 really
 hard
 and


last
 year
 we
 got
 100
 out
 of
 100
 in
 all


categories
 so
 we
 are
 super
 trans


transparent
 okay
 everything
 you
 want
 to


find
 you
 can
 see
 on
 our
 website
 I
 think


that's
 really
 important
 to
 be
 uh
 uh
 to


be
 transparent
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 what


you
 do
 needs
 to
 be
 have
 broad
 political


anchoring
 so
 everything
 we
 do
 is


anchored
 in
 the
 parliament
 that's
 uh


also
 very
 important
 because
 then
 the


politicians
 don't
 change
 their
 mind
 uh


and
 you
 haven't
 got
 a
 a
 change
 in
 policy


when
 you
 have
 a
 change
 of
 parliament
 so


uh
 so
 those
 are
 two
 two
 uh
 two
 very


important
 things
 and
 maybe
 so
 we
 can
 dig


a
 little
 bit
 into
 your
 activities
 so
 you


joined
 5
 years
 ago
 the
 fund
 based
 on
 my


research
 the
 fund
 went
 up
 80%
 since
 you


joined
 maybe
 I
 got
 the
 numbers
 wrong
 but


since
 2020
 until
 today
 the
 fund
 went
 up


by
 about
 80%
 yeah
 but
 I
 mean
 that's
 not


me
 right
 that's
 just
 uh
 that's
 financial


markets
 financial
 markets
 have
 been
 very


strong
 very
 but
 I
 would
 and
 of
 course


you
 have
 a
 a
 set
 mandate
 by
 the
 Ministry


of
 Finance
 and
 you
 are
 overseen
 by
 the


board
 within
 the
 central
 bank
 yeah
 but


to
 what
 extent
 did
 you
 manage
 to
 bring


in
 your
 own
 investment
 style
 within
 this


mandate
 you
 obviously
 your
 role
 is
 to


operationalize
 that
 mandate
 and


implement
 it
 uh
 to
 what
 extent
 you
 have


some
 degree
 of
 freedom
 to
 work
 within


that
 mandate
 to
 generate
 this
 type
 of


value
 yeah
 no
 we
 uh
 we
 of
 course
 do
 that


so
 we
 are
 uh
 working
 on
 in
 a
 more


systematic
 manner
 to
 learn
 from
 our


mistakes
 that's
 one
 thing
 so
 we've


created
 uh
 something
 called
 uh
 an


investment
 simulator
 so
 for
 instance
 now


you
 want
 to
 buy
 uh
 $10
 million
 of
 Apple


well
 before
 you
 manage
 to
 put
 the
 order


in
 you
 basically
 get
 back
 to
 you
 you


know
 Floren
 you're
 not
 very
 good
 in


technology
 because
 you
 never
 made
 money


in
 a
 Technology
 stock
 before
 uhhuh
 it's


a
 consensus
 trade
 you
 are
 best
 at


contrarian
 trades
 your
 uh
 Target
 uh


ticket
 size
 is
 $100
 million
 not
 $10


million
 and
 so
 on
 so
 you
 get
 all
 the
 you


get
 all
 your
 all
 your
 trade
 history
 uh


back
 to
 you
 in
 a
 systematic
 manner
 so


that
 you
 can
 easily
 more
 easily
 learn


from
 your
 mistakes
 now
 after
 having


implemented
 that
 we
 see
 that
 our


portfolio
 managers
 are
 better
 at
 running


the
 winners
 for
 longer
 and
 they're


cutting
 the
 losers
 quicker
 so
 it's


actually
 impacting
 their
 trading


Behavior
 so
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


did
 we've
 improved
 uh
 uh
 information


within
 the
 fund
 both
 internally
 and


externally
 and
 so
 now
 we
 know
 have
 you


know
 just
 a
 level
 of
 applications
 which


we
 have
 never
 seen
 before
 which
 has


meant
 that
 we
 have
 been
 uh
 you
 know
 just


I
 think
 improving
 pretty
 much
 everything


we
 do
 there
 is
 more
 a
 focus
 on


technology
 we
 are
 a
 very
 important


technology
 company
 and
 we
 can
 come
 back


to
 just
 how
 we
 are
 applying
 uh
 AI
 mhm


and
 so
 I
 think
 we've
 just
 been
 kind
 of


fine-tuning
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 we
 we


are
 working
 on
 on
 people's
 psyche
 in
 in


a
 different
 way
 so
 we
 use
 uh
 Sports


psychologists
 in
 the


fun
 now
 why
 do
 we
 use
 sport


psychologists
 yeah
 well
 the
 thing
 the


thing
 is
 that
 if
 I
 say
 listen
 you
 need


to
 you
 need
 to
 work
 with
 a
 psychologist


then
 you
 are
 ill
 if
 I
 tell
 you
 you
 have


to
 work
 with
 a
 sport
 psychologist
 then


you
 are
 a
 hero
 I
 got
 it
 okay
 even
 though


you
 talk
 about
 exactly
 the
 same
 things


and
 the
 reason
 why
 sport
 is
 so
 good
 is


because
 in
 sport
 they
 focus
 in
 on


process
 rather
 than
 outcome
 you
 know


before
 before
 a
 race
 you
 don't
 think
 gee


I
 really
 have
 to
 win
 this
 race
 you
 think


about
 you
 know
 I
 just
 need
 what
 do
 I


need
 to
 do
 just
 need
 to
 optimize
 every


part
 of
 the
 process
 and
 then
 the
 results


are
 basically
 a
 function
 of
 your
 process


it
 takes
 away
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stress
 and
 it


means
 that
 you
 can
 come
 through
 uh
 uh


tough
 periods
 in
 a
 much
 more
 resilient


and
 better
 way
 so
 I
 guess
 you
 are
 more


introspective
 in
 terms
 of
 figuring
 out


what
 works
 what
 doesn't
 work
 and
 do
 you


have
 an
 element
 of
 let's
 say


experimentation
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this


approaches
 to
 for
 instance
 avoid
 human


biases
 like
 the
 one
 that
 you
 mentioned


earlier
 yeah
 so
 we
 holding
 longer


selling
 faster
 yeah
 we
 work
 on
 all
 these


things
 you
 work
 on
 all
 those
 St
 okay
 and


do
 you
 and
 I'm
 sorry
 two
 more
 things
 uh


we
 try
 to
 increase
 the
 time
 Horizon
 for


our


investments
 um
 the
 thing
 is
 that
 the


more
 longterm
 you
 are
 the
 fewer


decisions
 you
 need
 to
 make
 and
 the
 fewer


decisions
 you
 make
 the
 better
 they
 tend


to
 be
 now
 if
 you
 have
 to
 make
 100


decisions
 a
 day
 of
 course
 they
 are
 not


going
 to
 be
 very
 good
 yeah
 if
 you
 make


one
 a
 month
 it's
 better
 going
 to
 be
 good


yeah
 much
 better
 for
 sure
 much
 better


the
 second
 thing
 is
 to
 work
 on
 the


ability
 to
 be


contrarian
 now
 if
 you
 have
 a
 square
 and


you
 have
 right


wrong
 consensus
 contrarian
 where
 is
 all


the


money
 well
 I
 guess
 following
 the
 average


following
 the
 crowds
 right
 consensus


that's
 where
 the
 money
 is
 not
 no
 no
 I
 no


no
 no
 I'm
 just
 saying
 what
 people
 do


that's
 what
 they
 do
 that's
 what
 people


do
 money
 would
 be
 on
 the
 contrarian
 side


abely
 so
 if
 you
 if
 you
 follow
 what


everybody
 else
 is
 doing
 you're
 never


going
 to
 lose
 your
 job
 you
 know
 you
 can


just
 load
 up
 on
 the
 most
 expensive


stocks
 and
 the
 most
 bought
 and
 hyped


stocks
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 lose
 your


job
 yeah
 indeed
 you
 can
 lose
 a
 lot
 of


money
 as
 long
 as
 everybody
 else
 is


losing
 money
 you're
 fine
 so
 to
 be
 in
 the


contrarian
 Square
 to
 be
 right
 contrarian


it's
 a
 very
 tough
 place
 to
 be
 but
 that's


where
 all
 the
 money
 is
 yeah
 now
 it's
 a


very
 fine
 difference
 between
 being


contrarian
 and
 right
 and
 contrarian
 and


wrong
 as
 you
 know
 much
 contrarian
 and


wrong
 you
 get
 fired
 absolutely


absolutely
 now
 uh
 so
 the
 thing
 is
 that


in
 finance
 uh
 you
 know
 life
 is
 not
 a


popularity
 contest
 my
 wife
 says
 only


people
 without
 friends
 say
 that
 uh
 but
 I


truly
 believe
 if
 you
 are
 very
 concerned


about
 having
 friends
 and
 people
 liking


you
 finance
 is
 not
 for
 you


yeah
 agree
 yeah
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 fear
 of


missing
 out
 out
 there
 yeah
 yeah


and
 uh
 okay
 very
 good
 so
 let
 me
 just


maybe
 dig
 a
 little
 deeper
 into
 how
 you


generate
 your
 returns
 so
 I
 know
 that


your
 mandate
 is
 to
 follow
 a
 particular


Benchmark
 which
 is
 fotsy
 all
 cap
 index


about
 8,900
 stocks
 and
 then
 an
 index
 of


bonds
 about
 18,000
 bonds
 out
 there
 your


portfolio
 is
 uh
 for
 those
 of
 you
 that


are
 not
 familiar
 about
 71%
 equities


public
 equities
 27%
 fixed
 income
 and
 the


rest
 is
 an
 real
 estate
 unlisted
 and


infrastructure
 so
 how
 do
 you
 generate


Alpha
 here
 relative
 to
 your
 benchmark
 I


I
 I
 did
 my
 research
 seems
 like
 you
 are


generating
 Alpha
 relative
 to
 your


benchmark
 so
 you're
 generating
 about
 25


basis
 points
 which
 might
 not
 seem
 like
 a


lot
 but
 given
 the
 capital
 that
 you
 have


that's
 gigantic
 especially
 that
 you


compound
 it
 over
 time
 so
 how
 do
 we
 think


about
 generating
 Alpha
 in
 such
 a
 large


enormous
 fund
 yeah
 keep
 it
 keeping
 in


mind
 that
 we
 also
 need
 to
 worry
 about


transaction
 costs
 right
 yeah
 I
 mean
 it


they
 could
 add
 up
 significantly


absolutely
 well
 we
 uh
 we
 have
 u
 a


decentralized
 uh
 structure
 MH
 so
 we
 have


uh
 sector
 Specialists
 and
 team
 working


in
 the
 various
 sectors
 you
 know


Financial
 team
 uh
 consumer
 team
 Tech


Team
 so
 both
 hardware
 and
 software
 and


they
 have
 autonomy
 in
 picking
 the
 stocks


they
 want
 they
 have
 autonomy
 full


autonomy
 absolutely
 um
 so
 they
 have
 uh


you
 know
 like
 a
 a
 benchmark
 and
 then


they
 are
 supposed
 to
 beat
 The
 Benchmark


and
 so
 this
 is
 all
 very


decentralized
 then
 um
 we
 also
 have
 5%
 of


the
 fund
 is
 run
 by
 external
 managers


that's
 mainly
 in
 Emerging


Markets
 uh
 roughly
 a
 third
 is
 or
 just


under
 30%
 is
 is
 from
 bonds
 so
 there


again
 it's
 decentralized
 to
 the
 various


regions
 and
 then
 we
 have
 real
 assets


where
 we
 own
 just
 under
 a
 thousand
 uh


properties
 around
 the
 world
 so
 for


instance
 here
 in
 in
 London
 we
 own
 25%
 of


region
 Street


yeah
 um
 and
 you
 recently
 bought


something
 in
 Mayfair
 as
 well
 right
 in


January
 seen
 the
 news


yeah
 okay
 so
 uh
 how
 how
 do
 you
 ensure


that
 these
 teams
 you
 know
 what
 what
 you


just
 told
 us
 is
 that
 they
 work
 in
 their


areas
 in
 their
 let
 call
 them
 silos
 maybe


but
 but
 how
 do
 they
 well
 they
 were
 silos


in
 the
 past
 but
 we
 work
 very
 hard
 to
 get


rid
 of
 the
 silos
 okay
 how
 did
 you
 manage


that
 with
 the
 system
 that


you
 created
 or
 how
 did
 you
 break
 this


side


you
 you
 break
 silos
 by
 uh
 talking
 about


it
 by
 being
 conscious
 about
 it
 by
 having


Corporation
 projects
 across
 by
 improving


communication
 across
 uh
 you
 work
 on
 it


very
 very


hard
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 really


interesting
 because
 our
 human
 nature
 is


to
 not
 share
 much
 information
 is
 to
 work


in
 silos
 is
 to
 be
 pretty
 short
 term
 you


know
 that's
 how
 we
 are
 as
 human
 beings


you
 know
 and
 then
 the
 job
 of
 a
 CEO
 is


basically
 to
 stretch
 you
 know
 stretch
 to


time
 Horizon
 make
 sure
 that
 people


communicate
 more
 share
 more
 all
 these


kind
 of
 things
 that's
 that's
 what
 we
 do


every
 day
 you
 know
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 mean
 even


though
 you
 track
 so
 many
 stocks
 close
 to


9,000
 stocks
 you
 are
 not
 really
 a


passive
 holder
 of
 those
 stocks
 you
 are


actually
 involved
 in
 governance
 issues


you
 vote
 in
 in
 meetings
 and
 absolutely


absolutely
 so
 so
 we
 have
 so
 we
 um
 I


would
 say
 we
 have
 active
 coverage
 of
 uh


800
 companies
 okay
 and
 then
 the
 rest


would
 be
 more
 passive
 it's
 really
 really


important
 to
 be
 an
 active
 uh
 uh
 to
 have


active
 Asset
 Management
 because
 we
 are


also
 an
 active
 owner
 okay
 we
 are
 not
 an


activist
 owner
 but
 we
 are
 an
 active


owner
 it
 means
 that
 we
 uh
 communicate


with
 companies
 we
 have
 some
 3,000


company
 meetings
 every
 year
 and
 we
 vote


really
 important
 we
 vote
 at
 more
 than


100,000
 uh
 uh
 resolutions
 at
 nearly


10,000
 uh


agms
 and
 what
 is
 interesting
 I
 think
 is


that
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 own
 one
 and
 a
 half%


of
 of
 all
 the
 equities
 in
 the
 world
 but


we
 pre-announce
 our
 voting
 intentions
 5


days
 ahead
 of
 agms
 so
 that
 everybody


else
 can
 see
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 vote
 and


that
 means
 that
 when
 we
 have
 against


votes
 roughly
 three
 percentage
 points


more
 would
 look
 at
 what
 we
 do
 so
 we
 have


impact
 on
 just
 under
 5%
 of
 all
 the
 votes


in
 the
 world
 so
 you're
 influencing
 also


other
 shareholders
 who
 are
 probably
 not


doing
 their
 homework
 well
 they
 can
 see


what
 we
 do
 right
 yeah
 yeah


and
 um
 I
 guess
 when
 when
 it
 comes
 to


this
 uh
 governance
 issues
 um
 is
 there
 an


element
 of
 learning
 because
 obviously


you
 have
 this
 very
 successful
 podcast


and
 you
 you
 are
 interviewing
 a
 lot
 of


very
 successful
 CEOs
 and
 the
 fund
 is


investing
 in
 those
 companies
 that
 are
 R


by
 those


CEOs
 what
 leadership
 styles
 have
 you


seen
 when
 when
 talking
 to
 the
 CEOs
 and


how
 what
 is
 your
 perception
 of
 of
 your


understanding
 of
 those
 individuals
 those


very
 successful
 individuals
 and
 their


Styles
 and
 how
 is
 that
 discussion
 maybe


shaping
 maybe
 your
 allocation
 or
 maybe


not
 yeah
 so
 I
 would
 not
 say
 it's
 shaping


allocations


um
 but
 what
 is
 happening
 to
 leadership


styles
 around
 the
 world
 I
 think
 it's


interesting
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 trend


towards
 uh
 a
 more
 kind
 of
 democratic
 way


of
 running
 a
 company
 so
 more
 uh


anchoring
 uh
 broader


consensus
 uh
 and
 flatter
 structures


that's
 something
 uh
 which
 is
 being
 kind


of
 accelerated
 by
 social
 media
 and
 so
 on


I
 think
 so
 this
 is
 uh
 in
 a
 way


digitalization
 probably
 yeah
 yeah
 this


is
 in
 a
 way
 a
 bit
 of
 the
 Scandinavian


Leadership
 Model
 so
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 moving
 up
 and
 then
 I
 think
 the


Indian
 leadership
 style
 is
 moving
 up
 and


it
 kind
 of
 started
 with
 the
 tech


companies
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 you
 know
 I


mean
 like
 the
 SAA
 Adella
 and
 some
 of
 the


other
 people
 there
 um
 very
 impressive


and
 I
 was
 in
 India
 the
 week
 before
 last


and
 met
 with
 um
 just
 under
 40
 CEOs
 and


we
 were
 talking
 about
 the
 Indian


leadership
 style
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 there


is
 there
 is
 a
 there
 is
 a
 level
 of


humbleness
 uh
 coming
 out
 of
 that
 you


know
 India
 even
 the
 gods
 are
 supposed
 to


be
 humble
 right
 and
 so
 they
 are
 very


humble
 and
 they
 are
 working
 for


something
 which
 is
 bigger
 than


themselves
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 empathy


there
 is
 um
 you
 know
 they
 don't
 like
 to


lay
 off
 people
 they
 like
 to
 treat
 people


really
 well
 and
 so
 there
 is
 something


there
 which
 is
 I
 think
 it's
 moving
 up


the
 whole
 kind
 of
 empathetic
 Edge
 it's


um
 it's
 very
 interesting
 and
 and
 do
 do


you
 see
 that
 this
 leadership
 style
 is


potentially
 leading
 to
 better


performance
 long
 term
 in
 the
 case
 of


those
 companies
 I
 mean
 because
 sometimes


uh
 let's
 say
 not
 fighting
 people
 in


during
 a
 difficult
 period
 might
 seem


like
 a
 very
 bad
 shortterm
 decision
 but


it
 might
 help
 those
 companies
 long
 term


like
 we
 had
 the
 recent
 experiment
 with


covid
 where
 companies
 fired
 very
 quickly


a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 then
 right
 after
 Co


they
 struggled
 to
 come
 back
 they
 in
 fact


never
 came
 back
 because
 they
 fired


critical
 people


absolutely
 yeah
 no
 I
 think
 generally
 you


the
 better
 you
 treat
 your
 people
 the
 the


better
 the
 results
 will
 be
 uh
 you
 know


to
 to
 a
 limit
 and
 and
 is
 is
 this
 an


element
 that
 you
 look
 at
 when
 you


analyze
 those
 800
 stocks
 is
 is
 this
 part


of
 your


analysis
 yes
 we
 do
 we
 do
 spend
 time
 on


on
 management
 uh
 quality
 and
 so
 on
 I


think
 it's
 interesting
 when
 I
 was


younger
 um
 I
 probably
 spent
 less
 time


looking
 at
 leadership
 styles
 and
 less


time
 looking
 at
 corpor
 culture
 corpor


culture
 is
 just
 unbelievably
 interesting


and
 you
 see
 two
 companies
 which
 can
 be


pretty
 much
 exactly
 the
 same
 and
 then


one
 company
 is
 doing
 really
 well
 and
 one


is
 doing
 really
 badly
 right
 you
 see
 it


to
 the
 extreme
 in


Banks
 I
 mean
 Banks
 I
 mean
 they're


basically
 the
 same
 yeah
 then
 some
 of


them
 are
 going
 bust
 and
 some
 of
 them
 are


hugely
 successful
 you
 know
 for
 tens
 and


tens
 of
 years
 and
 it's
 just
 like
 it's


the
 type
 of
 people
 you
 hire
 is
 how
 you


train
 them
 is
 how
 you
 think
 about


succession
 you
 know
 it's
 the
 values
 is


doing
 the
 right
 things
 but
 you
 see
 it
 in


Industry
 after
 industry
 you
 see
 it
 in


everything
 from
 you
 know
 to
 footware


companies
 may
 look
 the
 same
 two
 elevator


companies
 may
 look
 the
 same
 two
 defense


companies
 may
 look
 the
 same
 and
 then


some
 successful
 and
 someone
 not
 and
 I


think
 it's
 to
 understand
 the
 coroporate


culture
 and
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


that
 on
 the
 podcast
 yeah
 yeah
 and
 to


what
 extent
 do
 you
 think
 this
 leadership


styes
 and
 their
 success
 correlate
 with


the
 compensation
 at
 the
 executive
 level


to
 what
 extent
 do
 you
 think
 maybe
 the


compensation
 packages
 that
 people
 at


that
 level
 get
 are
 not
 optimal


enough
 is
 this
 something
 you
 look
 at
 or


yes
 we
 look
 at
 that
 yeah
 um
 what
 is


important
 for
 us
 it's
 not
 so
 much
 the


level
 of
 compensation
 about
 is
 the


structure
 mhm
 it
 should
 be
 long-term
 it


should
 be
 Equity
 based
 uh
 it
 should
 vest


over
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and
 it
 should
 be


uh
 and
 it
 should
 be
 dependent
 on
 on


results
 you
 know
 yeah


yeah
 okay
 so
 maybe
 we
 can
 switch
 a


little
 bit
 on
 related
 to


Performance
 when
 the
 markets
 are
 very


volatile
 you
 know
 the
 returns
 can


fluctuate
 quite
 a
 bit
 in
 2022
 you
 had
 a


significant
 loss
 you
 reported
 a


significant
 loss
 which
 obviously
 brings


with
 it
 some
 some
 costs
 maybe
 on
 the


political
 side
 but
 then
 23
 and
 2024
 were


very
 successful
 we
 had
 excellent
 returns


I
 just
 read
 an
 article
 in
 uh
 on
 Reuters


that
 last
 year
 your
 profit
 was
 over
 220


billion
 now
 the
 question
 that
 I
 wanted


to
 ask
 you
 especially
 in
 the
 context
 of


today
 is
 what
 happens
 when
 the


performance
 is
 not
 so
 good
 you
 know
 how


do
 you
 deal
 with
 that
 situation
 with
 the


pressure
 that
 you
 might
 have
 as
 a


long-term
 investor
 from
 you
 know
 maybe


people
 in
 the
 political
 Spectrum
 or
 or


people
 that
 are
 outside
 that
 you
 know


the
 the
 citizens
 of
 Norway
 right
 that


are
 maybe
 questioning
 what
 the
 fund
 is


doing
 they
 might
 not
 see
 the
 long-term


perspective
 that
 you
 take
 how
 do
 you


deal
 with
 that
 stay
 stay
 the
 course
 well


I
 think
 the
 really
 important
 thing
 is
 to


be
 very
 transparent
 about
 everything
 you


do
 so
 when
 we
 report
 results
 it


shouldn't
 come
 as
 a
 surprise
 and
 then
 is


to
 have
 that
 mandate
 and
 with
 the


Mandate
 we
 also
 have
 a
 risk
 budget
 and


the
 risk
 budget
 is
 measured
 in
 what
 is


called
 tracking
 error
 and
 it
 is
 a


measure
 for
 how
 far
 away
 from
 the
 index


you
 can
 be
 MH
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 really


important
 because
 if
 uh
 and
 that's


1.25%
 right
 is
 something
 like
 that
 yeah


so
 it
 means
 that
 in
 two
 out
 of
 three


years
 you
 should
 not
 be
 further
 away


than
 1.22%


25%
 um
 now
 why
 is
 that
 important
 well


it's
 important
 because
 if
 we
 had
 s
 lost


a
 lot
 of


money
 I
 would
 have
 been
 sacked
 at
 the


exact
 wrong
 time
 I
 would
 have
 been


sacked
 when
 the
 results
 were
 really


weak
 there
 is
 another
 person
 coming
 in


liquidating
 all
 the
 positions
 at
 the


worst
 possible


time
 uh
 so
 that's
 why
 that's
 important


actually
 in
 2022
 even
 though
 you


underperformed
 you
 did
 beat
 your


benchmark
 just
 to
 clarify
 but
 yeah
 and


then
 23
 24
 we
 didn't
 yeah
 um
 yeah
 and


transparency
 you
 think
 helps
 lot
 I
 mean


people
 understand
 the
 messaging
 that
 you


provide
 transparency
 is
 important
 and


expectation
 management
 is
 important
 you


know
 I
 think
 uh
 we've
 been
 saying
 for


some
 time
 I
 think
 returns
 will
 be
 very


low
 going
 forward
 if
 uh
 you
 know
 could


be
 easily
 be


negative
 um
 because
 we've
 had
 we've
 had


a
 period
 of
 uninterrupted
 growth
 we've


had
 very
 strong
 development
 in
 financial


markets
 we
 have
 had
 low
 interest
 rates


and
 we've
 had
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 a
 good


geopolitical
 situation
 yeah
 so


so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 lack
 of


information
 I
 would
 say
 associated
 with


all
 the
 other
 Sovereign
 wealth
 funds
 I
 I


tried
 to
 figure
 out
 you
 know
 to
 do
 some


comparison
 I
 actually
 did
 struggle
 a
 lot


to
 find
 anything
 other
 than
 that
 they


invest
 in
 other
 asset
 classes
 classes
 as


well
 but
 what
 I
 find
 fascinating
 as
 an


academic
 is
 the
 governance
 structure


that
 you
 have
 on
 top
 of
 uh
 Sovereign


wealth
 fund
 you
 you
 know
 your
 peers
 out


there
 and
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 them
 are


St
 stayed
 back
 the
 second
 is
 cic
 in


China
 and
 then
 you
 have
 um
 adaa
 in
 Abu


Dhabi
 kind
 of
 the
 third
 what
 do
 you


think
 it
 would
 be
 an
 ideal
 governance


structure
 is
 it
 the
 one
 that
 you
 have


could
 the
 one
 that
 you
 have
 be
 improved


or
 is
 there
 another
 structure
 that
 would


be
 more
 appropriate
 for
 a
 sovereign


wealth
 fund
 if
 you
 had
 a
 a
 blank
 canas


and
 you
 were
 to
 redo
 this
 again
 any


thoughts
 on
 that
 I
 I
 think
 uh
 given


Where
 We
 Are
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 in
 uh
 a


Democratic
 Society
 a
 very
 open
 Society


uh
 it's
 a
 good
 it's
 a
 good
 structure
 we


have
 it's
 the
 fund
 is
 owned
 by
 the


Norwegian
 people
 it's
 kind
 of
 taken
 care


of
 by
 the
 parliament
 the
 Ministry
 of


Finance
 uh
 is
 kind
 of
 running
 it
 they


have
 given
 the
 mandate
 to
 the
 central


bank
 and
 then
 we
 are
 situated
 inside
 the


central
 bank
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good


structure
 okay
 so
 in
 addition
 to
 the


governance
 you
 obviously
 they
 have
 a
 lot


of
 operational
 issues
 you
 mentioned
 that


you
 have
 about
 700
 employees
 or
 so
 and


you
 invest
 in
 you
 know
 1
 1.8
 trillion


worth
 of
 assets
 so
 there
 are
 lots
 of


stocks
 that
 one
 needs
 to
 pick
 you
 know


close
 to


9,000
 how
 do
 you
 employ
 technology
 to


make
 this
 more
 efficient
 I
 you
 mentioned


just
 that
 you
 cover
 mainly
 800
 but
 still


800
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 absolutely
 and


when
 the
 index
 changes
 we
 also
 have
 to


make
 transactions
 right
 so
 we
 have


something
 like
 35
 million
 transactions
 a


year
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 huge
 machine
 wow
 and


we
 are
 doing
 it
 more
 cost
 efficiently


than
 any
 Index
 Fund
 in
 the
 world
 so
 um


there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 Technology
 going


into
 this
 and
 and
 so
 how


exactly
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


more
 detail
 about
 this
 technology
 that


you
 use
 is
 something
 unique
 to
 to
 your


fund
 or
 is
 it
 something
 that
 you
 have


taken
 from
 other
 fund
 managers
 out
 there


in
 the
 public
 we
 have
 we
 have
 built
 it


up
 ourselves
 over
 the
 years
 um
 we
 have


everything
 in
 the


loud
 uh
 highly
 automated
 nearly


everything
 we
 do
 is
 uh
 is
 uh
 you
 know


straight
 through


processing


um
 so
 huge
 amount
 of
 technology
 I
 we
 are


one
 of
 the
 more
 important
 technology


companies
 in
 the
 country
 yeah
 I've
 seen


that
 one
 of
 the
 main
 departments
 that


you
 have
 internally
 is
 operations
 and


tech
 department
 which
 is
 which
 is
 very


important
 and
 probably
 you
 are
 hiring


people
 in
 that
 area
 as
 it's
 it's
 uh
 it's


really
 interesting
 so
 over
 the
 last
 uh


if
 you
 look
 at
 our
 last
 three
 months
 40%


of
 everybody
 in
 the
 fund
 have


contributed
 code
 to
 our
 Central
 code


bank
 so
 uh
 nearly
 half
 the
 firm
 can


program
 wow
 okay
 it's
 very
 it's
 it's


incredible
 and
 now
 with
 AI
 it's
 uh
 it's


phenomenal
 I
 mean
 we
 we


um
 we
 we
 were
 we
 were
 early
 in
 being


very
 very
 serious
 about
 Ai
 and
 and


um
 and
 how
 do
 you
 get
 AI
 into
 an


organization
 well
 first
 of
 all
 you
 have


to
 at
 the
 top
 just
 relentlessly
 bang
 on


about
 it
 right
 every
 time
 I
 get
 the


microphone
 I'm
 just
 banging
 on
 about
 it


all
 the
 people
 you
 recruit
 they
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 program
 so
 uh
 then
 all
 the


summer
 interns
 had
 programming
 uh


activities
 we
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 AI


ambassadors
 we
 have
 more
 than
 20
 people


across
 the
 firm
 which
 has
 got
 weekly


contact
 with
 uh
 with
 entropic
 which
 has


clawed
 and
 then
 we
 have
 all
 types
 of
 ser


uh
 mandatory
 training
 and
 so


on


uh
 so
 it's
 just
 absolutely
 incredible


what's
 going
 on
 now
 so
 I
 asked
 I
 asked


everybody
 in
 the
 firm
 in
 December
 how


much
 have
 you
 improved
 your
 efficiency


this
 year
 on
 average
 15%
 15
 or
 15
 five


wow
 you
 know
 that's
 across
 the
 board
 mhm


it's
 it's
 really
 really
 what
 are
 what


are
 successful
 uses
 of
 AI
 in
 in
 your


setting
 is
 it
 well
 so
 the
 thing
 is
 that


we
 use
 it
 we
 use
 it
 uh
 uh
 I
 was
 just


walking
 around
 we
 have
 100
 140
 people


here
 in
 London
 I
 walked
 around
 today
 mhm


uh
 to
 see
 what
 people
 were
 up
 to


everybody
 has
 clawed
 on
 one
 of
 the


screens
 they
 are
 working
 on
 it


continuously
 for
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 but


we
 for
 instance
 in
 trading
 we
 are
 using


it
 to
 reduce
 trading
 costs
 yeah
 um
 the


models
 can
 tell
 us
 for
 instance
 we
 can


sell
 something
 on
 a
 Monday
 and
 buy
 it
 on


a
 Friday
 because
 of
 uh
 index
 changes
 and


so
 these
 models
 help
 us
 reduce
 uh


trading
 by
 uh
 internalizing
 more
 of
 the


uh
 the
 and
 absolutely
 uh
 helping
 us


deploy
 Capital
 around
 month
 end
 as
 there


just
 like
 an
 endless
 amount
 of
 uh


activities
 we
 can
 use
 it
 for
 and
 you


prefer
 to
 have
 this
 type
 of
 Technology


internally
 as
 opposed
 to
 Outsource
 it


some
 some
 fund
 managers
 like
 to


Outsource
 this
 type
 of
 yeah
 we
 have
 we


have
 it
 internal
 you
 have
 everything


internally
 okay
 and
 other
 than
 the


technology
 and
 the
 AI
 uses
 I
 obviously


the
 value
 comes
 from
 the
 people
 right


the
 the
 talent
 that
 you
 have
 internally


and
 maybe
 you
 can
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


about
 first
 how
 you
 attract
 Talent
 how


you
 keep
 the
 talent
 and
 develop
 the


talent
 and
 and
 finally
 how
 you
 think


about
 succession
 planning
 yeah
 because


okay
 so
 I
 mean
 the
 people
 I
 mean
 the
 way


we
 work
 with
 people
 this
 is
 my
 so
 this


is
 my
 favorite
 topic
 okay
 so
 just
 uh


let's
 dig
 deep
 then
 absolutely
 now
 how


do
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 attract
 people


um
 well
 first
 we
 have
 you
 have
 to
 talk


about
 the
 mission
 and
 we
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 the
 mission
 and
 the
 importance
 of


the
 fund
 for
 the
 Norwegian
 the
 Norwegian


people
 and
 for
 society
 right
 um
 we
 are


out
 at
 universities
 we
 talk
 to


students
 we
 have
 the
 podcast
 which
 has


helped
 us
 improve
 application
 numbers


very
 significantly
 and
 then
 we
 send
 out


the
 real
 Specialists
 so
 when
 I
 joined


four
 years
 ago
 I
 accounted
 for
 60%
 of


all
 the
 external
 presentations
 last
 year


just
 over


10%
 when
 I
 joined
 there
 were
 four
 people


who
 spoke
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 fund
 last


year
 150
 people
 spoke
 on
 behalf
 of
 the


fund
 is
 this
 one
 of
 the
 kpis
 that
 you


said
 internally
 is
 very
 very
 important


because
 you
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 learn


from
 the
 real
 Specialists
 and
 if
 you
 can


put
 out
 the
 real
 Specialists
 there
 you


get
 just
 better
 applications
 and
 we
 put


out
 we
 got
 amazing
 women
 working
 in
 the


fund
 when
 when
 I
 joined
 we
 were
 there


were
 27%
 women
 now
 we
 are
 35%
 women
 uh


so
 we
 just
 get
 much
 better
 applications


across
 the
 board
 now
 how
 do
 you
 keep


people
 you
 make
 sure
 there
 is
 mobility


you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 move
 people


around
 uh
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 try
 to


give
 them
 really
 interesting
 things
 to


do
 you
 try
 to
 uh
 see
 them
 and


acknowledge
 them
 uh
 more
 MH
 and
 um
 and
 I


think
 that's
 you
 know
 and
 getting
 them


intrinsically
 motivated
 to
 do
 their
 job


is
 is
 challenging
 these
 days
 well
 um
 uh


well
 you
 have
 extrinsic
 motivation
 which


is
 money
 that
 only
 get
 you
 so
 far
 but
 I


think
 it's
 the
 intrinsic
 motivation
 and


the
 pride
 that's
 really
 really
 important


yeah
 yeah
 and
 you
 know
 you
 actually
 have


I
 noticed
 and
 then
 and
 then
 you
 know


what
 I
 think
 you
 have
 a
 very
 diverse


group
 from
 37
 countries
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 a


very
 International
 Organization
 but
 the


thing
 is
 there
 is
 nothing
 more
 fun
 than


investing
 it's
 the
 most
 fun
 thing
 you


can
 do
 why
 is
 it
 so
 much
 fun
 because


everything
 you
 eat
 and
 drive
 and
 wear
 is


made
 by
 companies
 you
 know
 you
 need
 to


understand
 technology
 change
 you
 need
 to


understand
 consumer
 preference
 you
 need


to
 understand
 you
 know
 what's
 going
 on


with
 with
 the
 products
 you
 need
 to


understand
 corpor
 culture
 you
 need
 to


understand
 greed
 and
 fear
 geopolitics
 uh


you
 know
 defense
 budgets
 uh
 all
 these


kind
 of
 things
 macroeconomics
 politics


and
 and
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 changing
 once


every
 month
 is
 changing
 like
 1,000
 times


every
 second
 and
 so
 there's
 nothing
 more


interesting
 you
 can
 do
 yeah
 I
 mean
 when


I
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 is
 just
 like
 I


just
 like
 spin
 out
 of
 bed
 you
 know
 I


just
 have
 to
 read
 what's
 going
 on
 what's


been
 happening
 overnight
 I
 mean
 it's


just
 so
 exciting
 and
 the
 thing
 is
 that


it
 has
 never
 been
 more
 exciting
 than
 now


because
 everything
 is
 changing
 so
 fast


and
 things
 which
 wasn't
 through
 true
 you


know
 a
 month
 ago
 is
 true
 today
 it's


unbelievable
 and
 on
 top
 of
 that


technology
 is
 changing
 so
 unbelievably


fast
 I
 mean
 you
 guys
 may
 watch
 the


Olympics
 okay
 so
 you
 have
 the
 Olympics


from
 one
 Olympics
 Olympics
 in
 Paris
 to


the
 next
 Olympics
 human


race
 improving
 speed
 by
 what
 1%
 2%
 okay


next
 Olympics
 another
 2%
 next
 Olympics


2%
 okay
 so
 perhaps
 you
 a
 human
 being
 can


run
 5%
 faster
 during
 three
 Olympics


technology


AI
 10
 times
 more
 chips
 10
 times
 more


efficient
 10
 times
 better
 software


that's
 a


1,000
 increase
 in
 complexity
 between
 two


Olympics
 next
 Olympics
 and
 not
 a


thousand
 times
 what's
 1,000
 time
 1,000
 a


lot
 of
 how
 much
 thousands
 a
 million
 it's


a
 million
 he's
 a
 professor
 good
 you
 put


me
 on
 the
 spot
 usually
 I
 put
 the


students
 on
 the
 spot
 okay
 now
 stay


concentrated
 next
 Olympics
 one
 1
 million


time
 1,000
 a
 billion
 a
 billion
 you
 see


so
 a
 billion
 times
 increase
 in


complexity
 you
 know
 while
 the
 human
 race


is
 just
 standing
 still
 I
 mean
 is
 that


interesting
 or
 not
 and
 you
 are
 living


through
 these
 times
 you
 know
 nobody
 has


lived
 through
 these
 times
 before
 it's


unbelievable
 so
 how
 can
 the
 human
 mind


deal
 with
 this
 complexity
 we
 are
 we
 are


wired
 to
 simplify
 things
 to
 to
 have


shortcuts
 I
 mean
 I
 can
 see
 when
 my


students
 submit
 assignments
 they
 all


follow
 shortcuts
 you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 how


how
 do
 we
 manage
 this
 complexity
 with
 a


limited
 brain
 okay
 you
 manage
 complexity


by
 trying
 to
 stay
 agile
 and
 by
 loving


change
 yeah
 we
 need
 to
 love
 change
 and


we
 need
 to
 be
 amazed
 by
 what's
 going
 on


how
 can
 you
 best
 position
 yourself
 to


cope
 with
 change
 learn
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 you
 know
 when
 you
 got


out
 of
 London
 Business
 School
 you
 have


you
 have
 narrowed
 down
 in
 a
 way
 on


business
 so
 that's
 not
 so
 good
 so
 you


need
 to
 broaden
 out
 again
 you
 know
 you


need
 to
 learn
 about
 social
 psychology


you
 need
 to
 learn
 about
 anthropology
 you


need
 to
 learn
 about
 all
 these
 kind
 of


different
 things
 you
 need
 to
 read
 books


you
 know
 really
 wide
 you
 need
 to
 read


the
 Russian
 Classics
 right
 you
 need
 to


and
 you
 need
 to
 have
 many
 different


types
 of
 friends
 people
 with
 more


different
 type
 of
 friends
 are
 more


Innovative
 and
 they
 come
 up
 with
 better


ideas
 so
 you
 need
 to
 just
 so
 all
 of
 you


before
 you
 leave
 today
 you
 need
 to
 shake


hands
 with
 two
 people
 you
 never
 met


before
 you
 need
 to
 just
 improve
 the


network
 of
 people
 you
 talk
 to
 because


that
 help
 helps
 you
 absorb
 uh
 new


information
 and
 helps
 you
 better


navigate
 the
 change
 we
 see
 in
 the
 world


yeah
 you
 need
 to
 have
 range
 right
 you


need
 to
 cross
 pollinate
 ideas
 from
 other


fields
 an
 investment
 is
 indeed
 a


multidisciplinary
 activity
 you
 mentioned


psychology
 at
 the
 beginning
 and
 it's


getting
 more
 complicated
 right
 to
 stay


ahead
 of
 the
 game
 yeah
 and
 then
 you
 need


to
 be
 confidently
 humbl
 you
 need
 to
 be


humble
 about
 all
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 you


don't
 know
 that's
 the
 great
 thing
 about


the
 market
 always
 keeps
 you
 humble
 yeah


absolutely
 I
 mean
 um
 the
 market
 has
 got


one
 job
 and
 that's
 to
 try
 to
 steal
 your


money
 every
 day
 and
 it's
 doing
 pretty


well
 yeah
 I'm
 mindful
 of
 the
 time
 I
 want


to
 open
 it
 for
 Q&A
 from
 the
 audience
 but


I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 one
 last
 question
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 people
 in
 the
 room


here
 trying
 to
 pursue
 a
 career
 in
 in


probably
 in
 Investments
 that's
 why
 maybe


you
 are
 here


and
 I
 was
 wondering
 uh
 if
 you
 put


yourself
 in
 your
 20s
 now
 that
 the
 person


that
 you
 in
 your
 20s
 what
 advice
 would


you
 give
 to
 yourself
 when
 you
 are
 20
 or


to
 to
 our
 students
 over
 here
 yeah
 I
 mean


the
 most
 important
 what
 would
 you
 do


differently
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 is


just
 never
 listen
 to
 your
 parents
 right


I
 mean
 never
 never
 listen
 to
 your


parents
 my
 son
 is
 over
 there
 yeah
 never


don't
 don't
 listen
 to
 him
 I
 mean
 he
 can


hardly


calculate
 uh
 I'm
 struggling
 Under


Pressure
 so
 um
 no
 you
 have
 to
 do
 what


you
 love
 you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 follow


your
 passion
 if
 you
 don't
 follow
 your


passion
 life
 is
 going
 to
 be
 miserable


you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 any
 fun
 and


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 very
 good
 at
 it


because
 you
 need
 to
 love
 what
 you
 do
 so


I
 asked
 Yensen
 H
 you
 know
 Nvidia
 yeah


say
 so
 Jensen
 how
 much
 do
 you
 work
 so


well
 you
 know
 what
 uh
 uh
 I
 wake
 up
 at


5:00
 in
 the
 morning
 I
 work
 uh
 the
 whole


day
 uh
 until
 I
 go
 to
 bed
 I
 work
 every


day
 I
 work
 every
 Saturday
 every
 Sunday


every
 holiday
 I
 like
 wow
 but
 when
 do
 you


relax
 yeah
 but
 ncol
 I
 relax
 all
 the
 time


because
 I
 love
 what
 I
 do
 and
 so
 you
 need


to
 love
 what
 you
 do
 so
 it's
 so
 you
 need


to
 do
 what
 you
 have
 a
 passion


for
 then
 you
 need
 to


then
 you
 need
 to
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 how


much
 money
 you
 make
 in
 your
 first
 job
 or


second
 job
 it's
 all
 about
 the
 learning


you
 need
 to
 find
 somebody
 across
 the


table
 who
 you
 think
 will
 really
 teach


you
 and
 care
 about
 your
 learning
 okay


very
 important
 I
 was
 really
 poor
 until


very
 late
 in
 life
 because
 I
 had
 made


nearly
 no
 money
 in
 my
 in
 my
 first
 few


jobs
 doesn't
 matter
 you
 know
 money
 will


come
 knowledge
 compounds
 at
 the
 highest


rate
 possible
 totally
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's


amazing


um
 and
 and
 then
 it's
 just
 to
 have
 an


open
 mind
 um
 broaden
 out
 learn
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 I
 mean
 perhaps
 the
 most


um
 important
 degree
 I
 did
 was
 social


psychology
 I
 did
 a
 degree
 at
 the


lsse
 um
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 probably
 like


seven
 years
 ago
 I
 did
 it
 quite
 recently


social
 psychology
 it's
 about
 it's
 about


how
 you
 learn
 it's
 about
 how
 you
 take


away
 your
 biases
 it's
 about
 how
 you
 make


decisions
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 I
 mean
 you
 are
 so
 lucky
 you
 are


still
 so
 young


so
 Al
 ask
 the
 last
 question
 I
 think
 we


are
 going
 to
 close
 it
 so
 maybe
 just


going
 forward
 what
 do
 you
 see
 the
 equity


markets
 if
 you
 were
 to
 invest
 a
 dollar


today
 which
 geography
 or
 segment
 within


this
 public
 Equity
 Market
 would
 you
 kind


of
 lean
 towards
 and
 this
 is
 outside
 the


fund
 obviously
 we
 understand
 that
 the


fund
 is
 to
 track
 the
 markets
 but
 where


do
 you
 see
 some
 opportunities
 maybe
 for


the
 let's
 say
 uh
 occasional
 investors
 in


the
 room
 here
 okay
 if
 you
 want
 to
 invest


in
 fin
 markets
 you
 want
 to
 be
 very


Diversified
 and
 very
 longterm
 okay
 okay


now
 what
 will
 give
 you
 better
 returns


than
 financial


markets


education
 education
 it's
 the
 best


investment
 you
 can


make
 one
 investment
 better
 than


that
 spend
 your
 money
 on
 experiences


with
 family
 and


friends
 that
 is
 the
 investment
 which


will
 give
 you
 the
 most
 happiness
 over


time
 and
 with
 that
 good
 luck
 with


everything
 and
 all
 the
 best
 thank
 you


thank
 you
 so
 much
 thank
 you
