[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Good
 morning.
 Good
 morning.
 Good


morning.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 We


got
 a
 green
 premarket
 which
 is
 very
 nice


to
 see.
 Hopefully
 that
 green
 pre
 which


is
 continuing
 from
 the
 overnight
 markets


yesterday
 can
 continue
 into
 the
 actual


market
 open
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 find
 out


in
 about
 45
 minutes.
 Uh
 we
 got
 some


China
 headlines
 that
 are
 relatively


bullish
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 the
 markets


are
 actually
 green
 in
 the
 pre
 and
 we're


going
 to
 get
 some
 more
 updates
 on
 that


China
 stuff
 throughout
 the
 entire
 day.


So
 hopefully
 that
 stuff
 is
 not
 as
 bad


going
 into
 Seoul
 where
 President
 Trump


will
 be
 meeting
 with
 Xi
 Jinping,
 the


Chinese
 president
 on
 November
 1st.
 By


the
 way,
 uh
 Trump
 might
 be
 meeting
 with


Kim
 Jong-un
 on
 November
 1st
 as
 well.
 So


that
 that
 was
 a
 new
 update
 we
 found
 out


about
 today.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if


that
 happens.
 President
 Trump
 was
 the


only
 president
 in
 American
 history
 that


actually
 met
 with
 the
 uh
 dictator
 in


North
 Korea
 uh
 back
 in
 2018.
 So,
 that


might
 happen
 again
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of


October,
 early
 November.
 We
 got
 Tesla


and
 Netflix
 this
 week.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


a
 big
 one,
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 Tesla
 and
 Netflix.
 We'll
 do


a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 earnings
 preview
 and


see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 there.
 We


had
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 updates
 for


some
 of
 these
 tech
 stocks
 in
 the


pre-marketing,
 including
 some
 uh


upgrades
 on
 Apple,
 these
 iPhone
 17


pre-order
 numbers,
 and
 then
 actual
 order


numbers
 are
 starting
 to
 come
 in,
 and


it's
 pretty
 damn
 juicy.
 You
 got
 one
 firm


even
 raising
 Apple
 to
 275


and
 another
 firm
 raising
 them
 to
 310.


first
 $300
 up
 here
 on
 Apple
 that
 we've


seen
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 So,
 we'll
 talk


about
 that.
 We'll
 go
 through
 some
 of


those
 details
 and
 then
 we'll
 talk
 about


Amazon
 because
 Amazon
 had
 some
 issues
 in


the
 uh
 in
 the
 pre-market,
 not
 just
 the


stock,
 but
 the
 actual
 company
 itself
 and


that
 affected
 Robin
 Hood,
 Coinbase,


Snapchat,
 all
 the
 companies
 that
 rely
 on


AWS.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that
 and
 keep


going
 from
 there.


All
 right,
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Let's
 get
 started.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to


get
 into.
 Hassets
 on
 CNBC
 right
 now.


We'll
 get
 to
 him
 in
 a
 second.
 He's


talking
 about
 this
 government
 shutdown.


Hopefully
 he's
 saying
 something
 positive


about
 the
 shutdown.
 He
 does
 have
 the


quote
 right
 here
 that
 I
 I
 think
 the


shutdown
 is
 likely
 to
 end
 sometime
 this


week,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 think a


lot
 of
 people
 were
 expecting.
 Uh
 and
 if


the
 shutdown
 doesn't
 end,
 the
 White


House
 will
 look
 at
 stronger
 measures.


Hopefully,
 it
 ends
 up
 uh
 getting
 fixed


in
 the
 next
 coming
 days.
 Yes,
 happy


Diwali
 to
 everybody
 as
 well.
 For
 those


that
 do
 celebrate
 it,
 Indian
 holiday,
 I


am
 going
 to
 be
 going
 back
 home
 tonight


to
 uh
 see
 some
 family
 for
 Dvali.
 So,
 if


you
 are
 Indian
 and
 you
 do
 celebrate
 it,


happy
 Dvali
 to
 everybody
 as
 well.
 It's


kind
 of
 a
 what
 is
 it?
 It's
 it's
 it's
 I


mean
 it's
 basically
 a
 holiday
 that
 se
 uh


that
 that
 celebrates
 good
 over
 evil
 if
 I


had
 to
 sum
 it
 up.
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 backstory
 to
 what
 good
 over
 evil


means
 but
 at
 its
 core
 it's
 a
 celebration


of
 good
 over
 evil.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 got


on
 the
 Bali.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 get


started.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 to
 start
 with


this
 China
 news
 because
 this
 is
 the
 most


bullish
 stuff
 we've
 had
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 days
 and
 that
 is
 why
 the


markets
 are
 green
 in
 the
 pre.
 Uh
 Trump


last
 night
 basically
 calmed
 down
 a
 lot


of
 concerns
 when
 it
 came
 to
 deescalation


around
 um
 China
 and
 this
 was
 stuff
 that


you
 know
 the
 market
 really
 was
 looking


for
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of
 getting
 it
 I


think
 that's
 why
 we
 are
 seeing
 this


green
 momentum.
 S&P
 500
 667
 if
 we
 can


get
 670
 maybe
 673
 which
 is
 alltime
 highs


is
 not
 that
 crazy
 to
 achieve.
 Tesla's
 up


1%.
 Palanteer's
 up
 1%.
 Hoodie
 up
 3%.


Google's
 up.
 Grab's
 up.
 Reddit's
 up.


Amazon's
 up
 even
 with
 Amazon's
 issues
 in


the
 pre-market.
 Meta's
 up.
 Salesforce,


AMD,
 SoFi,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 based
 on
 what


Trump
 said
 last
 night
 uh
 around
 China.


And
 what
 did
 he
 say?
 Well,
 basically
 he


said
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 resolve
 things
 and


he
 doesn't
 want
 to
 get
 into
 this
 massive


trade
 war
 with
 China.


>> Uh
 now
 they're
 paying
 an
 unbelievable


amount
 of
 money
 to
 the
 United
 States.


They
 probably
 can't
 pay
 that
 much.
 And


I'm
 okay
 with
 that.
 We
 can
 lower
 that,


but
 they
 have
 to
 do
 things
 for
 us,
 too.


It's
 no
 longer
 a
 one-way
 street.
 Yeah.


>> What
 would
 you
 lower
 it
 to,
 do
 you


think?


>> Depends.
 I
 mean,
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 what


they
 want.
 One
 of
 the
 penalties
 we
 have


in
 because
 they're
 sending
 in
 fentinol,


we
 have
 a
 20%,
 as
 you
 know,
 a
 20%
 tariff


on
 that,
 but
 they'd
 be
 paying
 about
 157%


tariff,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 record


setting
 type
 tariff.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 want


them
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 want
 to
 help
 China.
 I


want
 to
 not
 looking
 to
 hurt
 China,
 but


they
 have
 to
 give
 us
 things,
 too.


>> Mr.
 President,


>> as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there,
 pretty


bullish,
 right?
 I
 want
 to
 help
 China.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 hurt
 China,
 but
 they
 have


to
 give
 us
 some
 stuff,
 too.
 He
 also
 goes


on
 to
 then
 talk
 about
 how
 he
 doesn't


want
 to
 play
 the
 rare
 earth
 mineral
 game


with
 China
 and
 he
 wants
 China
 to


actually
 cooperate.
 China's
 also,
 you


know,
 said
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days


that
 they
 are
 ready
 to
 work
 with
 the
 US


and
 decoupling
 from
 them
 would
 be


irrational.
 And
 then
 here's
 the
 biggest


thing
 that
 happened
 that
 kind
 of
 went


under
 notice
 over
 the
 weekend.
 This
 was


Scott
 Bent
 talking,
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 better


word,
 talking
 smack
 about
 one
 of
 the


Chinese
 officials
 uh
 last
 week
 and
 then


we
 have
 an
 update
 on
 what
 happened
 to


one
 of
 those
 Chinese
 officials.
 B
 and
 C.


Therefore,
 we
 had
 to
 do
 D.
 And
 that


that's
 not
 true.
 Is
 there
 there
 was
 a


low
 lower
 level
 trade
 person
 who
 was


slightly
 unhinged
 here
 in
 August.
 Uh
 I


think
 his
 name
 is
 Lee
 Lee
 Kangong.
 and


uh
 you
 know
 threatening
 saying
 that
 the


chi
 China
 would
 unleash
 chaos
 on
 the


global
 system
 if
 the
 US
 went
 ahead
 with


uh
 our
 docking
 fees
 for
 Chinese
 ships


and
 uh
 this
 is
 clearly
 something
 that


they
 were
 planning
 all
 along.
 I
 I
 think


that
 things
 can
 deescalate


that
 we
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 to


escalate.
 Uh
 we
 have
 things
 that
 are


>> I
 think
 things
 can
 deescalate.
 we
 don't


want
 to
 escalate.
 And
 then
 last
 night,


China's
 top
 trade
 negotiator,
 Lee,
 the


guy
 that
 descent
 just
 mentioned,
 was


removed
 as
 a
 permanent
 World
 Trade


Organization
 representative.


So,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 talking
 about
 some


major
 progress.
 Not
 only
 is
 Trump
 saying


we
 want
 to
 deescalate
 with
 China,
 then


Bent
 who's
 calling
 out
 the
 quote
 unquote


unhinged
 representative
 from
 China
 as


one
 of
 their
 top
 rep
 one
 of
 their
 top


trade
 negotiators.
 He
 gets
 removed
 as
 a


permanent
 representative
 with
 the
 World


Trade
 Organization.
 Meaning
 Bent
 just
 is


not
 going to
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 this
 guy


anymore.
 He's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal
 with


someone
 who's
 probably
 uh
 a
 bit
 more


reasonable.
 Yes,
 he
 got
 a
 black
 guy.


Exactly.
 Maybe
 Bent
 had
 a
 had
 a
 role
 in


getting
 this
 guy
 removed.
 But
 the
 point


is
 it's
 deescalating
 and
 this
 is
 very


very
 nice
 to
 see
 and
 as
 long
 as
 that


continues
 to
 happen
 maybe
 this
 China


scuffle
 that
 has
 been
 taking
 place
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of


a
 deal
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that
 would
 be


very
 good
 for
 markets.
 Uh
 CleanSpark


getting
 an
 upgrade
 right
 here
 look
 at


that
 2183
 up
 11%.
 The
 headline
 right


here
 is
 CleanSpark
 has
 hired
 a


industry
 veteran
 in
 the
 AI
 compute
 space


Jeffrey
 Thomas
 as
 the
 senior
 vice


president
 of
 AI
 data
 centers.
 All
 right.


So,
 Clean
 Sparks
 making
 the
 full-on


pivot
 right
 here
 to
 a
 data
 center
 play


outside
 of
 a
 Bitcoin
 miner.
 And
 I'm
 sure


you
 know
 they
 will
 still
 engage
 in


Bitcoin
 mining,
 but
 hiring
 someone
 from


the
 industry
 to
 lead
 their
 AI
 compute


data
 center
 businesses,
 that
 likely


means
 you're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of a
 pivot.


So,
 CleanSpark
 right
 there,
 that
 is
 up


11%.
 Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners


had
 a
 crappy
 week
 last
 week.
 Cipher
 is


up
 6%,
 Terolf
 is
 up,
 Bit
 Farm's
 up,
 Hive


is
 up,
 Marathon's
 up,
 Riot's
 up,
 Galaxy


up,
 and
 then
 IN
 is
 also
 up
 in
 the


premarket.
 All
 of
 them
 getting
 some
 love


as
 the
 broader
 market
 goes
 green
 and
 the


S&P
 500
 up
 about
 041%.
 Micron
 by
 the
 way


going
 crazy.
 They
 got
 an
 upgrade
 to
 245


this
 morning.
 I
 know
 not
 everyone


there's
 not
 a
 majority
 of
 people
 that


invest
 in
 semiconductors
 that
 are
 in


Micron
 but
 there's
 a
 decent
 chunk.


Micron
 right
 they're
 up
 4%.
 I
 mean
 it's


not
 the
 hottest
 semiconductor
 name
 but


it
 is
 one
 of
 those
 names
 that
 has


developed
 an
 audience
 and
 you
 know
 this


thing
 was
 at
 105
 eight
 months
 ago.
 Now


it's
 at
 210.
 So
 not
 too
 bad.
 We
 are


seeing
 some
 more
 momentum
 there.
 and


that
 is
 likely
 not
 slowing
 down.
 Let's


transition
 over
 to
 Hasset,
 see
 what
 he's


saying
 about
 the
 shutdown,
 see
 if
 we
 can


get
 some
 updates
 on
 that
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 into
 uh
 some
 headlines
 around
 Nvidia


has
 been
 very
 active
 throughout
 this


process.
 But
 it's
 also
 his
 position
 that


this
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 the
 Senate
 needs
 to


work
 out.
 Uh
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 friends
 in
 the


Senate
 have
 said
 that
 it
 was
 just
 bad


optics
 for
 Democrats
 to
 open
 the


government
 before
 the
 no
 kings
 rally
 and


that
 now
 there's
 a
 shot
 that
 this
 week


things
 will
 come
 together
 and
 very


quickly
 the
 moderate
 Democrats
 will
 move


forward
 and
 get
 us
 an
 open
 government
 at


which
 point
 we
 could
 negotiate
 whatever


policies
 they
 want
 to
 negotiate
 with


regular
 order.
 Now,
 I
 was
 very
 pleased


to
 see
 that
 my
 friend
 Senator
 Shaheen


from
 New
 Hampshire,
 a
 a
 very,
 you
 know,


soundminded
 Democrat,
 came
 out
 and


supported
 opening
 the
 government
 on


Friday.
 So,
 it
 means
 that
 there
 sort
 of


cracks
 in
 the
 Schumer
 armor.
 I
 think
 the


Schumer
 shutdown
 is
 likely
 to
 end


sometime
 this
 week.
 But,
 I
 can
 tell
 you


that
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 if


the
 story
 that
 we've
 been
 basically


hearing
 from
 moderates
 that
 look,
 we


just
 can't
 do
 it
 in
 front
 of
 the
 no


Kings
 rally.
 If
 that
 ends
 up
 not
 being


true,
 then
 I
 think
 that
 the
 White
 House


is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 look
 very
 closely


along
 with
 Russ
 vote
 at,
 you
 know,


stronger
 measures
 that
 we
 could
 take
 to


bring
 him
 to
 the
 table.


>> So,
 there
 would
 be
 negotiations
 about


what
 to
 do.
 We're
 we're
 running
 out
 of


time
 before
 November
 1st.
 There
 would
 be


negotiations
 about
 what
 to
 do
 with
 with


the
 uh
 the
 pandemic
 u
 super
 subsidies


for
 Obamacare.
 Well,
 well,
 that
 again
 is


an
 issue
 for
 the
 Senate
 that
 you
 know
 we


the
 Democrats
 passed
 that
 law.
 They
 uh


it
 was
 in
 an
 emergency
 for
 COVID
 and


they
 ended
 it
 now
 because
 it
 was
 such
 an


expensive
 law
 and
 so
 it's
 the
 Democrats


policy.
 It's
 the
 Democrats
 shut
 down
 and


it's
 the
 Schuber
 shutdown
 and
 really
 the


Senate
 needs
 to
 figure
 it
 out.


>> But
 it
 it
 affects
 you
 know
 real
 people


and
 people
 in
 red
 states
 and
 I
 mean


we're
 we're
 subsidizing
 healthcare
 for
 a


lot
 of
 but
 like
 it
 or
 not
 that's
 just


the
 position
 we're
 in.
 So
 there
 are


certain
 people
 that
 either
 wouldn't
 have


health
 care
 or
 where
 the
 the
 premiums


would
 go
 up
 so
 much.
 And
 not
 not
 to
 say


that
 it's
 uh
 you
 know
 not
 Obamacare's


fault
 because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 flaws,


but
 do
 you
 see
 something
 where
 there


would
 be
 some
 fixes
 put
 in
 to
 get


Republicans
 to
 agree
 to
 do
 that?


>> Again,
 that's
 up
 to
 the
 Senate
 to


negotiate.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


expiring
 subsidies,
 you
 know,
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 people,
 certainly
 lowincome


people,
 aren't
 affected
 at
 all.
 It's


just
 that
 uh
 the
 the
 policy
 was
 expanded


to
 people
 up
 to
 four
 times
 the
 poverty


level
 and
 so
 you
 get
 people
 who
 have
 you


know
 much
 much
 higher
 incomes
 than
 were


intended
 to
 be
 predicted
 by


>> All
 right.
 So
 Hassid
 giving
 us
 a
 little


bit
 of
 an
 update
 right
 there
 on
 the
 idea


of
 this
 government
 shutdown
 ending.
 I


mean
 so
 far
 the
 market
 hasn't
 really


cared
 that
 much
 about
 it.
 So,
 if
 it
 ends


up
 lasting
 as
 long
 as
 Kalshi
 thinks
 it


can
 last,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 up
 until


November
 16th,
 they're
 giving
 it
 a
 uh
 a


30%
 chance
 right
 there,
 then,
 you
 know,


that
 would
 be
 pretty
 aggressive.
 But
 if


it
 is
 resolved
 this
 week,
 then
 I
 do


think
 that
 would
 be
 more
 bullish
 than


not.
 The
 question
 is,
 will
 we
 end
 up


seeing
 that
 happen?
 And
 and
 the
 other


thing
 that's
 really
 important
 about


this,
 Khi
 now
 has
 40
 days
 on
 the


forecast.
 The
 other
 thing
 that's


interesting
 about
 this
 is,
 you
 know,
 we


still
 don't
 have a
 lot
 of
 government


data.
 Now,
 we
 will
 be
 getting
 CPI.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 happening
 on
 Friday.


So,
 we'll
 at
 least
 be
 getting
 some
 gauge


of
 inflation.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 be


happening
 a
 couple
 days
 before
 the
 FOMC


meeting
 on
 October
 29th
 where
 more


likely
 than
 not,
 we're
 getting
 another


25
 basis
 point
 cut.
 But
 having
 that
 CPI


definitely
 would
 be
 important.
 Having


some
 job
 data
 would
 really
 be
 important.


And,
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 if
 we
 can
 get


the
 shutdown
 avoided
 or
 at least


resolved,
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 of
 that
 data.
 But,
 we're
 going


to
 see
 throughout
 the
 week
 if
 that
 ends


up
 happening
 as
 well.
 real
 quick
 as


well.
 I
 said
 this
 on
 the
 uh
 Market


Future
 show
 last
 night,
 but
 just
 want
 to


announce
 it
 here.
 Uh
 Cactus
 Jack
 has


officially
 joined
 AK
 Media
 Fulltime.
 So


uh
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 probably
 already


know
 him
 every
 day
 in
 the
 chat.
 He's


he's
 basically
 like
 our
 personal


Bloomberg
 terminal.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 he's


joining
 full-time.
 So
 this
 is
 our
 first


extension
 of
 AK
 Media.
 Going
 to
 have


someone
 who
 helps
 me
 basically
 get
 all


the
 news
 that
 I
 need
 every
 single
 day,


pre-show,
 post
 show,
 during
 the
 show.


and
 uh
 you
 know
 he's
 already
 been
 doing


it
 for
 like
 a
 year
 so
 I
 just
 asked
 do


you
 do
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 full-time
 if


you're
 already
 gonna
 be
 here
 and
 he
 said


yeah
 let's
 do
 it.
 So
 there
 he
 is.


Whenever
 you
 see
 a
 post
 from
 Cactus
 Jack


you
 can
 assume
 it's
 more
 likely
 true


than
 not.
 I
 mean
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 some


things
 he'll
 possibly
 get
 wrong
 maybe


because
 the
 source
 is
 wrong.
 Uh
 but
 more


likely
 than
 not
 he
 will
 be
 up
 to
 date


and
 accurate
 on
 pretty
 much
 every
 piece


of
 breaking
 news.
 So
 if
 you
 see
 an


earnings
 update
 or
 a
 price
 target


upgrade
 you
 can
 trust
 that
 you're


getting
 it
 from
 a
 reliable
 source.
 All


right,
 cool.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 from


Mr.
 Cactus.
 Let's
 go
 to
 BMR.
 I
 mean,
 Tom


Lee,
 this
 guy
 continues
 to
 buy
 the
 damn


dip.
 He
 bought
 203,000


Ethereum
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Tom
 Lee,
 the


crypto
 market
 saw
 one
 of
 its
 largest


deleveraging
 events
 last
 week,
 and
 this


put
 downward
 pressure
 on
 ETH
 prices.


Open
 interest
 for
 ETH
 sits
 at
 the
 same


level
 as
 seen
 on
 June
 30th
 of
 this
 year.


Given
 the
 expected
 super
 cycle
 for


Ethereum,
 this
 price
 dislocation


represents
 an
 attractive
 riskreward.
 We


acquired
 200,000


Ethereum
 tokens
 over
 the
 past
 week,


pushing
 our
 ETH
 holdings
 to
 3.24


million,
 2.7%
 of
 the
 total
 supply.
 We


are
 now
 more
 than
 halfway
 towards
 our


initial
 pursuit
 of
 the
 alchemy
 of
 5%.


Most
 people
 don't
 even
 think
 he's
 going


to
 stop
 at
 5%.
 B
 Riley
 with
 a
 $90


upgrade
 on
 BMR
 thinks
 they're
 going to


get
 to
 7.2%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 2026.


And
 it
 makes
 sense
 because
 why
 would


they
 stop,
 right?
 like
 they're
 probably


not
 going
 to
 stop
 just
 because
 the
 price


of
 Ethereum
 goes
 up,
 especially
 if


they're
 able
 to
 continue
 diluting
 at
 a


premium
 to
 their
 net
 asset
 value.
 So,


look,
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 on
 the
 Ethereum


bandwagon,
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 it,
 I
 did


do
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 BMR.
 This
 was
 one
 of


the
 stocks
 that
 was
 on
 the
 Substack.
 BMR


and
 Duolingo
 were
 the
 two
 stocks
 that
 we


uh
 that
 we
 did
 a
 deep
 dive
 on.
 And
 you


know,
 if
 you
 read
 through
 the
 deep
 dive,


it's
 it's
 it's
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 a
 better


understanding
 of
 the
 mechanisms
 and


mechanics
 of
 how
 a
 digital
 asset


treasury
 should
 operate,
 but
 also
 if


Ethereum
 is
 an
 asset
 worth
 operating
 on.


And
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 those
 two
 things,


then
 you
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 for
 the


volatility
 of
 the
 ride,
 but
 the
 ride


might
 end
 up
 rewarding
 people
 long
 term.


Bit
 mine
 right
 there,
 5.52%
 got
 all
 the


way
 to
 47
 last
 week
 as
 Ethereum
 took
 a


hit.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 really
 is


dependent
 on
 Ethereum.
 And
 if
 Ethereum


can
 stay
 above
 4,000
 where
 it
 is
 right


now,
 we
 should
 hopefully
 be
 able
 to
 stay


in
 that
 uh
 in
 that
 $50
 range.
 So
 that's


what
 you
 have
 on
 Bitine
 and
 that's
 what


you
 have
 on
 Ethereum.
 Now
 again,
 last


week
 Devon
 Ryan
 initiated
 a
 price
 target


on
 $50
 on
 SSB,
 which
 is
 one
 of the


competitors
 for
 Bitine.
 And
 you
 know,
 I


I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 ESB,
 but
 I


do
 know
 that
 if
 Wall
 Street
 analysts
 are


starting
 to
 get
 bullish
 on
 ETH


treasuries,
 that's
 a
 good
 thing.
 And


that's
 definitely
 not
 something
 that
 we


should
 ignite.
 By
 the
 way,
 FG
 Nexus,


which
 is
 another
 Ethereum
 treasury,
 they


lost
 their
 premium
 to
 NAV.
 They
 were
 now


trading
 below
 Nav,
 same
 as
 ESB.
 Bitmine


is
 one
 of
 the
 only
 digital
 asset


treasuries
 outside
 of
 Micro
 Strategy


that
 actually
 trades
 at
 a
 premium
 above


NAV.
 And
 um
 these
 guys
 initiated
 a
 $200


million
 buyback.
 So,
 Bitmine
 already
 has


a
 billion
 dollar
 buyback
 if
 they
 trade


below
 NAV.
 The
 whole
 point
 is
 to
 not
 get


below
 NAV,
 but
 these
 guys
 initiated
 a


buyback
 for
 if
 they
 do
 get
 below
 NAV,


which
 they
 are
 below
 below
 NAV.
 Again,


it's
 just
 I
 wouldn't
 buy
 anything


outside
 of
 the
 winners
 in
 the
 space.
 And


I
 think
 the
 winners
 are
 BMR
 and
 probably


Micro
 Strategy
 for
 Bitcoin.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of the
 other
 treasuries
 have
 a
 lot


of
 different
 issues
 and
 raising
 capital


is
 one
 of
 those
 issues.
 You
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 effectively
 do
 it
 and
 I
 think


BMR
 is
 doing
 this
 at
 scale.
 ETHZilla,
 I


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 them.


They
 were
 supposed
 to
 have
 some
 special


meeting
 a
 week
 ago
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 know


what
 the
 outcome
 of
 that
 meeting
 was,


but
 oh,
 they
 did
 a
 reverse
 split.
 Oh,


that's
 probably
 why
 they
 had
 they
 had
 to


do
 it.
 1680.
 This
 thing
 was
 like
 $4,


right?


Yeah,
 they
 probably
 split.


Again,
 you
 got
 to
 pick
 the
 winners
 in


the
 space
 and
 I
 think
 BMR,
 especially


with
 Tom
 Lee,
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of


those
 winners.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 there,


5251


as
 we're
 green
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 All


right,
 let's
 talk
 about
 Nvidia.
 So,


Nvidia,
 actually,
 let's
 do
 Amazon
 before


we
 do
 Nvidia.
 So,
 what
 happened
 to


Amazon
 in
 the
 pre-markets?
 Well,
 AWS
 got


shut
 down,
 and
 it
 got
 shut
 down
 bad.
 the


northeast
 sector
 of
 the
 country
 that


runs
 on
 AWS
 uh
 basically
 fell
 apart.
 And


I
 was
 sleeping
 when
 this
 happened.
 So,
 I


woke
 up
 at
 like
 5
 a.m.
 and
 I
 saw
 the


updates,
 but
 I
 wasn't
 like
 trading
 on


the
 overnight
 markets
 on
 Robin
 Hood,
 so


I
 didn't
 see
 like
 that
 much
 of
 the
 uh


dismay
 that
 people
 had,
 but
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 upset
 about
 it.
 Uh
 and
 they


were
 upset
 about
 Coinbase,
 they
 were


upset
 about
 Snapchat.
 So,
 it
 wasn't
 a


specific
 issue
 to
 any
 of
 these


companies.
 It
 was
 just
 AWS
 had
 a
 massive


uh
 draw
 down.
 Now,
 we
 don't
 know
 exactly


why
 it
 fell.
 Was
 it
 a
 bug?
 Was
 it
 a


crowd
 start
 strike
 moment?
 Was
 it
 one
 of


these
 things
 where
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,


some
 engineer
 forgot
 to
 push
 an
 update?


Like
 it
 lit
 literally,
 this
 has
 happened


before
 where
 engineers,
 you
 know,
 forgot


to
 push
 updates
 or
 do
 certain
 things
 and


then
 the
 entire
 system
 collapses.
 So,
 we


don't
 know
 the
 exact
 details
 of
 what


happened
 other
 than
 it
 ended
 up
 going


down
 and
 the
 memes
 are,
 you
 know,


absolutely
 hilarious
 of
 of
 what
 ended
 up


happening.
 I
 think
 the
 takeaway
 from


this,
 it's
 now
 been
 resolved
 over
 the


past
 like
 five
 hours,
 so
 it's
 not
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal
 anymore.
 I
 think
 the


takeaway
 from
 this
 is
 very
 simple,
 and
 I


hate
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 to
 say
 it,
 but
 it
 is


true.
 And
 I
 I
 was
 the
 same
 person
 who


said
 this
 when
 CrowdStrike
 fell,
 and
 I


bought
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 should
 have


bought
 a
 lot
 more
 during
 that
 time.
 Bad


publicity
 on
 a
 company
 that
 literally


runs
 the
 internet.
 At least
 half
 the


internet
 shut
 off
 for
 a
 couple
 hours


when
 AWS
 went
 down.
 It
 just
 shows
 you


how
 much
 the
 world
 relies
 on
 Amazon.


It's
 just
 that
 simple.
 So,
 uh,
 you
 know,


the
 stock
 was
 red
 a
 little
 bit,
 now
 it's


green.
 I
 know
 the
 stock
 has
 not
 really


moved
 that
 much
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 if
 every
 major
 company
 on
 the
 planet


or
 you
 know
 a
 significant
 portion
 of


every
 major
 company
 is
 using
 AWS.
 I
 mean


if
 the
 thing
 shuts
 down
 and
 the
 whole


world
 shuts
 down
 because
 of
 whatever


reason
 bug
 code
 you
 know
 what
 whatever


maintenance
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 how


much
 the
 world
 needs
 AWS
 and
 needs


Amazon
 and
 if
 they
 can
 show
 any


acceleration
 in
 growth
 then
 I
 think
 the


street
 will
 get
 back
 on
 board
 to
 the


story
 and
 the
 stocking
 gets
 momentum.


Amazon
 has
 quadrupled
 their
 operating


income
 since
 2021.
 4x
 operating
 income,


stocks
 up
 12%.
 There
 is
 obviously
 a


narrative
 issue
 with
 this
 stock
 and


that's
 okay
 because
 that's
 when
 you
 want


to
 buy,
 but
 narratives
 change
 and
 if


narratives
 change
 quickly,
 then
 the


stock
 prices
 can
 also
 change
 very


quickly
 as
 well.
 Eric
 says
 this
 happens


to
 them
 like
 every
 year
 and
 there
 are


other
 options.
 Yeah,
 that
 is
 fair.
 Look,


the
 bare
 case
 on
 this,
 I
 don't
 want
 to


say
 it's
 it's
 fully
 bullish
 just
 because


they
 went
 down
 and
 you
 saw
 you
 saw
 how


much
 the
 world
 relied
 on
 them.
 the
 bare


cases,
 people
 might
 leave
 and
 they
 might


say,
 you
 know what,
 we
 can't,
 you
 know,


whatever
 Robin's
 like,
 dude,
 we
 cannot


rely
 on
 AWS
 going
 down.
 We're
 gonna
 have


to
 go
 to
 GCP
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 Um,


so
 that
 is
 the
 bare
 case.
 It's
 just,
 you


know,
 if
 this
 has
 happened
 every
 year


and
 they
 continue
 to
 quadruple
 operating


income,
 it
 probably
 means
 that
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 other
 alternatives


just
 aren't
 good
 enough
 to
 get
 people
 to


switch
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 And
 that's


what
 keeps
 Amazon
 at
 the
 top.
 21408.


Again,
 AWS
 acceleration,
 that's
 what
 you


got
 to
 look
 like.
 I
 and
 again
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 like
 I'm
 pounding
 the
 table


on
 Amazon
 because
 we
 might
 have
 a
 crappy


Q3
 where
 AWS
 doesn't
 accelerate,
 margins


go
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 because
 the
 tariffs


and
 this
 stock
 is
 at
 195.
 Like
 that
 is


very
 possible.
 I
 would
 not
 be
 surprised


if
 that
 happened
 quite
 frankly
 if
 we
 get


under
 200.
 That
 would
 be
 the
 opportunity


to
 really
 buy
 and
 set
 up
 a
 position
 for


2026.
 Uh
 but
 I
 also
 think
 it
 could


easily
 rerate
 to
 230
 240
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 if
 a
 narrative
 goes
 in
 the


opposite
 direction.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


the
 base
 case
 we
 have
 to
 be
 thinking


about
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 when
 it
 comes
 to


Amazon.
 Okay,
 Nvidia,
 what
 do
 we
 got


going
 on?
 So,
 uh,
 Jensen
 and
 TSM
 made
 a


pretty
 big
 announcement
 over
 the
 weekend


and
 it
 was
 that
 they
 officially
 unveiled


the
 first
 wafer
 for
 their
 Blackwell
 chip


that
 was
 created
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> This
 last
 week
 was
 a
 historic
 week.
 Uh,


we
 manufactured
 the
 most
 advanced
 AI


chips
 in
 the
 world
 in
 the
 most
 advanced


fab
 in
 the
 world
 here
 in
 America
 for
 the


first
 time.
 Uh
 all
 of
 this
 started
 with


President
 Trump
 wanting
 to


reindustrialize
 the
 United
 States.
 His


terrorist
 was
 a
 pressing
 uh
 agent
 in


making
 this
 possible
 at
 this
 at
 the
 at


the
 speed
 that
 we're
 doing.
 And
 now
 at


uh
 uh
 just
 in
 shortly
 after
 less
 than
 a


year,
 we're
 now
 manufacturing
 the
 most


advanced
 chips
 for
 AI
 here
 in
 the
 United


States.
 This
 is
 just
 the
 beginning
 of


it.
 uh
 with
 the
 partnership
 of
 the


supply
 chain
 in
 Taiwan,
 TSMC
 is


incredible
 partner
 in
 a
 strategic


partner
 for
 the
 United
 States
 and
 in


bringing
 manufacturing
 of
 the
 most
 in


most
 critical
 sector
 of
 technology
 here


to
 to
 United
 States.
 Uh
 this
 is
 just
 the


starting
 point
 where
 after
 that
 with


Foxcon,
 Amcor,
 Spill,
 uh
 Wistron,
 so


many
 of
 our
 other
 partners,
 we're
 going


to
 bring
 the
 entire
 supply
 chain
 of


building
 AI
 infrastructure
 back
 here
 in


the
 United
 States.
 By
 the
 end
 of
 uh
 the


next
 uh
 three
 or
 four
 years,
 we'll


probably
 manufacture,
 we're
 on
 on
 target


to
 manufacture
 about
 half
 a
 trillion


dollars
 of
 AI
 supercomputing
 technology


to
 be
 installed
 here
 in
 the
 United


States.


Pretty
 cool
 stuff
 from
 Jensen.
 And


obviously,
 you
 know,
 Trump
 loves
 hearing


that
 the
 re-industrialization
 of


semiconductors
 is
 beginning
 to
 happen
 in


the
 United
 States.
 We
 did
 get
 the
 AMCOR


mention,
 which
 is
 very
 nice.
 Not
 that


many
 packaging
 companies
 that
 work
 as


closely
 as
 AMC
 does
 with
 TSM
 and
 the
 fab


that
 TSM
 have
 has
 in
 Arizona.
 3215,


right?
 They're
 up
 2.75%
 for
 AMC.
 I
 mean,


look,
 this
 is
 really
 bullish
 Nvidia
 and


this
 is
 bullish
 the
 entire
 semiconductor


ecosystem.
 Jensen
 goes
 on
 in
 that


interview
 to
 basically
 say
 we
 are
 not
 in


a
 bubble.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


early
 cycles
 of
 capex
 and
 capex
 spend.


If
 you
 believe
 Jensen,
 then
 you
 believe


that
 this
 really
 is
 the
 beginning.
 If


you
 don't
 believe
 it,
 then
 you
 think


that
 all
 this
 capex
 spend
 is
 going
 to
 go


for
 nothing.
 Essentially,
 these


companies
 are
 spending
 hundreds
 of


billions
 of
 dollars
 for
 no
 reason.
 If


that's
 not
 the
 case,
 then
 a
 lot
 of that


manufacturing
 comes
 back
 to
 the
 United


States,
 creates
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs,
 and


ultimately
 continues
 the
 capex
 cycle
 um


at
 the
 rate
 that
 it's
 going
 at
 right


now.
 Now
 JP
 Morgan
 came
 out
 with
 a


report
 this
 morning
 and
 they
 said
 Nvidia


CEOs
 Jensen
 Huang's
 prediction
 of
 AI


capex
 growing
 from
 600
 billion
 to
 3.4


trillion
 by
 2030
 is
 feasible.
 The
 bank


expects
 the
 tech
 sector
 to
 fund
 it


through
 operating
 cash
 flow,
 private


equity,
 venture
 capital
 inflows,
 even


with
 projected
 1.6
 trillion
 annual


funding
 gap.
 Private
 markets
 could


contribute
 to
 about
 500
 billion
 per
 year


by
 2030.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 private


markets
 are
 ready
 to
 invest
 in
 this.
 I


mean
 there
 was
 a
 company
 that
 raised
 a


133
 million
 seed
 round
 in
 the
 AI
 space.


They're
 building
 another
 foundation


model
 particularly
 around
 spatial
 uh


reasoning
 is
 kind
 of
 how
 they
 call
 it.


So
 there's
 essentially
 an
 LLM
 for
 a


specific
 sector
 of
 the
 market
 which
 a


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 going
 after


and
 the
 harder
 ones
 kind
 of
 Vlad
 is


doing
 this
 with
 mathematical
 super


intelligence
 do
 require
 more
 capital.
 Uh


so
 you're
 going to
 have
 that
 going
 on.


You've
 obviously
 got
 the
 private
 markets


funding
 OpenAI
 and
 Anthropic.
 Anthropic


raising
 their
 revenue
 targets
 to
 26


billion.
 They're
 doing
 five
 billion


right
 now
 for
 next
 year.
 I
 mean
 like
 26


billion
 in
 2026
 is
 pretty
 damn


incredible.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 the


private
 markets
 are
 ready
 to
 be
 funded


in
 this
 way
 is
 leading
 JP
 Morgan
 to


believe
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 possible.


They
 estimate
 roughly
 40%
 of
 new
 debt,


430
 billion
 would
 come
 from
 bank
 loans


and
 60%
 from
 bond
 issuance.
 This
 is
 kind


of what
 Oracle
 did
 with
 their
 corporate


bonds
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 Even
 with
 this


increase,
 the
 tech
 industry's
 net
 debt


to
 cash
 flow
 ratio
 would
 rise
 only


from.7
 to
 1.2,
 still
 below
 the
 global


average.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 that


are
 comparing
 this
 to
 1999
 saying
 that


it's
 all
 funded
 through
 debt,
 it's
 like


it's
 hard
 to
 say
 that
 when
 there's
 so


much
 cash
 flow
 and
 so
 much
 of
 that
 cash


flow
 being
 redirected
 in
 the
 places
 that


need
 to
 be
 um
 allocated
 to
 when
 it
 comes


to
 this
 capex
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 that's


what
 the
 big
 tech
 companies
 are
 doing.


Now
 JP
 Morgan
 did
 say
 you
 should
 be


cautioned
 for
 energy
 infrastructure
 not


financing
 as
 the
 next
 major
 bottleneck


as
 the
 AI
 data
 center
 growth
 drives


massive
 new
 power
 demand
 aka
 the
 energy


stocks
 are
 likely
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 bid


even
 if
 the
 financing
 of
 it
 is
 going
 to


take
 some
 time
 for
 it
 to
 play
 out.
 So


that
 is
 why
 you
 continue
 to
 see
 the


energy
 names
 get
 the
 momentum
 that
 they


get.
 Oaklo
 right
 here
 in
 the
 pre-markets


up
 another
 3%
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 rare


earth
 stocks
 are
 also
 pretty
 green
 as


they
 were
 green
 in
 the
 overnight
 markets


after
 going
 through
 you
 know
 relatively


ugly
 red
 but
 you
 know
 that's
 bullish
 for


Ian
 that's
 bullish
 for
 clean
 spark
 again


if
 you
 have
 a
 thesis
 on
 these
 Bitcoin


miners
 turn
 data
 centers
 or
 the
 nebuses


or
 their
 core
 reeves
 of
 the
 world
 I
 mean


your
 thesis
 is
 pretty
 strong
 the


question
 is
 what
 valuation
 do
 you
 want


to
 get
 into
 these
 guys
 and
 what
 is
 your


timeline
 but
 the
 and
 you
 know
 not
 all
 of


these
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 turn
 out
 to
 be


winners
 but
 if
 there
 is
 way
 more
 demand


than
 supply
 then
 you're
 going
 going
 to


need
 a
 lot
 of
 residual
 demand
 going
 to


some
 of
 the
 winners
 that
 are
 not
 as
 big


of
 a
 winner
 as
 like
 a
 corewave,
 but


they're
 still
 going
 to
 get
 some
 part
 of


that
 market
 and
 that
 ultimately
 could


help
 their
 stock
 price
 as
 well.
 Speaking


of
 Nebius,
 uh
 there
 were
 some
 rumors


this
 morning,
 Nebius,
 right?
 They're
 up


3%.


Data
 center
 uh
 in
 Israel
 and
 as
 a
 result


uh
 you
 got
 this
 right
 here.
 The
 idea
 is,


well,
 Roman,
 the
 co-founder,
 posted
 this


picture,
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 company


is
 preparing
 to
 announce
 the
 launch
 of


one
 of
 its
 new
 data
 centers,
 most
 likely


in
 the
 UK
 or
 Israel.
 There'll
 be
 4,000


GB200s


to
 begin
 the
 partnership
 uh
 in
 one
 of


those
 new
 data
 centers.
 Again,
 just
 more


and
 more
 expansion.
 Nebas,
 if
 they
 can


get
 another
 one
 of
 those
 Microsoft


deals,
 would
 be
 very
 bullish.
 Question


is
 if
 that
 will
 end
 up
 playing
 out.


SMCI,
 that
 one's
 going
 green
 in
 the


pre-markets
 as
 well.
 Rumors
 of
 an
 XAI


contract.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Wow.
 Up
 5.4%.


4%.
 Uh
 so
 looks
 like
 that
 deal
 is
 or


that
 rumor
 is
 coming
 out
 right
 now.
 SMCI


talk
 of
 contract
 order
 from
 XAI


circulating
 as
 per
 Bloomberg.


Okay.
 I
 mean
 look,
 this
 is
 inevitable.


Jason
 and
 Chris
 have
 been
 saying
 this


for
 a
 while,
 which
 is
 that
 if
 we're


going
 to
 sell
 more
 GPUs,
 you're
 going
 to


need
 more
 server
 racks
 to
 be
 able
 to


handle
 those
 GPUs.
 and
 Dell
 increasing


their
 financial
 guidance
 double
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 line
 last
 week
 was
 I


think
 a
 signal
 for
 SMCI
 to
 eventually
 do


the
 same.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 SMCI
 is
 not


the
 the
 best
 stock
 in
 the
 world
 in
 terms


of
 its
 margins
 for
 every
 incremental


dollar
 it
 gets,
 but
 it
 likely
 will
 have


to
 grow.
 Like
 the
 pure
 volume
 of
 the


amount
 of
 server
 racks
 and
 liquid


cooling
 technology
 they're
 going to
 be


serving
 to
 these
 GPUs
 across
 the
 entire


world
 has
 to
 grow.
 I
 mean,
 you
 it's


them,
 Dell,
 and
 HP.
 So,
 and
 and
 we
 kind


of
 saw
 this
 with
 Micron.
 You
 know,


Micron
 was
 deemed
 as
 a
 commodity,
 was


stuck
 at
 100
 for
 a
 while,
 and
 then


demand
 went
 up,
 growth
 went
 up,
 they


started
 showing
 results,
 and
 Micron


completely
 rerated.
 So,
 if
 that
 does


happen
 with
 SMCI,
 which
 largely
 hasn't


moved
 that
 much
 since
 liberation
 day,


that
 would
 be
 exciting.
 Meta
 right


there,
 723,
 Amazon
 213,
 Reddit,
 that's


up
 3.3%
 back
 above
 300
 or
 200.
 And
 then


Palenteer


180
 as
 well
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 which
 is


what
 we've
 got.
 All
 right,
 let's
 talk


about
 some
 macro
 stats.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 last
 week
 we
 had
 some
 regional


financial
 issues.
 Uh,
 Western
 Alliance


and
 Zions
 reported
 a
 couple
 of
 faulty


loans
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 sent
 some
 shocks


to
 the
 system.
 Uh,
 here's
 a
 chart
 right


here
 showing
 that
 regional
 banks
 are
 not


breaking.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 credit
 issues


tied
 to
 private
 credit
 funds,
 they're


isolated
 while
 net
 interest
 income,


credit
 losses,
 and
 capital
 look
 the


strongest
 in
 years.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of


the
 charts
 that
 shows
 lending
 to
 non-d


depository
 financials,
 as
 you
 can
 see


right
 there,
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 it's


in
 a
 bad
 situation
 compared
 to


historical
 averages
 that
 we've
 had
 with


non-depository
 financials.
 The
 other


thing
 that's
 really
 important
 about
 this


is
 that
 the
 uh
 credit
 provision
 losses


in
 Truist
 and
 a
 couple
 other
 banks
 that


reported
 on
 Friday,
 they
 were
 great.


They
 were
 way
 better
 than
 expected.
 Like


way
 better.
 Like
 we're
 talking
 about
 100


to
 $200
 million
 less
 than
 what
 expected.


It
 was
 very
 similar
 to
 to
 what
 JP
 Morgan


and
 City
 Bank
 said.
 So
 I
 think
 the


regional
 crisis
 again
 still
 continues
 to


be
 isolated
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 banks
 that


were
 that
 produced
 a
 couple
 of
 faulty


loans.
 It
 is
 not
 endemic
 of
 the
 broader


structure
 of
 private
 credit
 and
 as
 long


as
 that's
 the
 case
 I
 think
 that
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 the
 bare
 case
 that
 breaks


this
 bull
 market.
 I
 mean
 there's
 I
 think


plenty
 of
 other
 things
 that
 could
 break


this
 bull
 market
 versus
 the
 regional


banks
 but
 it
 is
 something
 to
 care
 about


because
 you
 know
 private
 credit
 is


definitely
 something
 that
 could
 make


things
 bad.
 It's
 just
 there's
 not
 enough


evidence
 outside
 of,
 you
 know,
 one


company
 or
 two
 companies
 showing
 that


there
 are
 some
 issues.
 So,
 as
 a
 result


of
 that,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 have


too
 many
 problems
 with
 the
 regional


banks.
 KRE,
 this
 thing
 was
 down
 10%
 last


week.
 It's
 up
 about
 1%,
 recovered
 3%
 on


Friday.
 This
 one
 might
 be
 the


opportunity
 if
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have


too
 many
 issues
 in
 the
 private
 private


credit
 ecosystem.
 SoFi,
 also
 very


bullish
 for
 SoFi.
 So,
 I
 decided
 I
 will


be
 buying
 some
 SoFi
 before
 earnings.
 I


don't
 own
 any
 SoFi
 right
 now.
 Um,
 I'm


thinking
 500
 shares.
 And
 the
 simple


logic
 is,
 well,
 I
 want
 to
 have
 fun
 if


the
 stock
 goes
 up
 and
 I'll
 share
 in
 the


misery
 if
 the
 stock
 goes
 down.
 I
 mean,


no,
 in
 all
 seriousness,
 look,
 I
 think


Tanner
 is
 right
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be


a
 record
 member
 quarter.
 I
 think
 those


members
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 translate


into
 net
 income
 that's
 higher
 than


expected
 from
 the
 street.
 I
 think
 not


has
 a
 chance
 to
 put
 up
 a
 35%
 growth


quarter.
 Street's
 expecting
 29%.
 If
 they


get
 to
 40%,
 I
 think
 that'd
 be
 very


bullish.
 And
 then
 finally,
 the
 banks
 are


crushing
 it
 across
 the
 board
 outside
 of


two
 regional
 banks.
 SoFi
 crushed
 it.
 I


mean,
 SoFi
 will
 crush
 it
 because
 JP


Morgan,
 Black
 Rockck,
 Morgan
 Stanley,


etc.
 crushed
 it.
 SoFi
 is
 going
 to
 crush


it
 on
 a
 smaller
 scale
 than
 those
 guys,


but
 their
 rate
 of
 growth
 is
 going
 to
 be


faster.
 It's
 gonna
 be
 better.
 And
 their


underwriting
 is
 phenomenal.
 Not
 to


mention
 cryptos
 coming
 back.
 I
 don't
 see


the
 bare
 case
 on
 SoFi.
 I
 really
 don't


like
 at
 this
 moment.
 I
 I
 don't
 see.
 And


then
 you
 have
 rate
 cuts
 coming
 up.
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 500
 share


earnings
 yolo,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 we


get
 that
 ugly
 of
 an
 earnings.
 And
 if
 the


stock
 drops,
 then
 the
 stock
 drops
 for


whatever
 reason.
 It
 would
 probably
 be
 a


buy
 the
 dip
 if
 the
 earnings
 are
 good.


But
 I
 think
 you're
 probably
 going
 to
 get


another
 triple
 B
 and
 we
 shouldn't
 have


that
 many
 issues.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 happens
 with
 SoFi,
 but
 that


earnings
 will
 be
 happening


over
 the
 next
 week.
 The
 bare
 case
 is


that
 it
 rose
 70%
 in
 three
 months,
 that


is
 fair.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 make
 the
 bare


case
 about
 valuation
 and
 price
 action,


then
 100%.
 But
 when
 a
 stock
 usually
 does


that,
 that
 that that
 means
 that
 their


next
 earnings
 has
 to
 be
 perfect.
 I'm
 not


saying
 so
 far
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 a


perfect
 earnings,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 feel


like
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 the
 worst


earnings
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 hopefully


that
 can
 lead
 to
 some
 more
 momentum.


Also,
 we
 were
 above
 30
 for
 a
 little
 bit,


right?
 So,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 if
 it
 can


normalize
 above
 that
 30
 going
 into
 rate


cuts.
 Also,
 their
 earnings
 are
 a
 day


before
 the
 Fed
 makes
 their
 decision.


So,
 I
 mean,
 you
 get
 a
 good
 quarter
 and


then
 you
 get
 rate
 cuts
 a
 day
 later.
 It


could
 it
 could
 set
 up
 for
 something


explosive,
 dude.
 It
 depends
 on
 how
 well


not
 I
 mean
 the
 way
 this
 thing
 really


gets
 up
 to
 3540
 is
 if
 AWS
 of
 fintech


their
 Galileo
 product
 starts
 getting


some
 more
 growth
 more
 than
 10
 12%.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 going to
 be
 this


quarter
 but
 I
 think
 notto
 has
 some


options
 to
 really
 give
 us
 a
 good
 quarter


and
 if
 it
 does
 coinciding
 with
 the
 rate


cuts
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 be
 too


bearish.
 Uh
 speaking
 of
 banks
 we
 do
 have


one
 update
 on
 a
 bank
 that
 I
 did
 not
 know


about.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 French
 people
 in
 the


audience
 might
 know
 about
 this
 company


and
 even
 if
 you're
 not
 French,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 if
 you're
 in
 Europe,
 uh
 BNP


Parabos,
 which
 I'm
 probably
 saying
 the


name
 wrong,
 had
 its
 worst
 day
 since


March
 2023.
 Was
 down
 10%
 today.
 Why?
 A


federal
 jury
 found
 the
 bank
 complicit
 in


aiding
 genocide
 in
 Sudan
 by
 violating
 US


sanctions,
 triggering
 the
 threat
 of


large
 contingent
 liabilities
 and


escalating
 legal
 risk.


Of
 course,
 I
 said
 it
 wrong.
 Of
 course.


Oh,
 I
 said
 it
 right.
 Parabis.
 Parabus.


You
 don't
 pronounce
 the
 S.
 Oh,
 it's


probably
 true.
 You
 You
 don't
 pronounce


the
 It's
 French,
 right?
 But,
 uh,
 so,
 you


know,
 you
 do
 have
 some
 global
 banks
 that


are
 not
 having
 the
 best
 time
 in
 the


world.
 But
 again,
 you
 know,
 the
 reason


I'm
 bringing
 this
 up
 is
 like,
 is
 this
 a


structural
 reason
 the
 banking
 sector


isn't
 an
 issue?
 No.
 This
 is
 one
 bank


that
 ended
 up
 financing
 something
 that


they
 were
 not
 supposed
 to
 be
 financing.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of


customers.
 This
 is
 the
 biggest
 bank
 in


France,
 by
 the
 way.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of


customers
 saying,
 "Hey,
 like
 we
 don't


want
 our
 money
 associated
 with
 this."


And
 now
 you
 might
 have
 some
 issues
 in


terms
 of
 people
 taking
 out
 their
 assets


and
 leaving
 somewhere
 else.
 Is
 it


something
 that
 collapses
 the
 banking


system?
 No.
 Did
 Zions
 and
 Western


Alliance
 last
 week
 in
 the
 United
 States


collap
 the
 banking
 system,
 losing
 a


billion
 dollars
 in
 market
 cap?
 No.
 So


again,
 you
 don't
 have
 these
 massive


China
 structural
 issues.
 You
 don't
 have


these
 massive
 banking
 issues.
 You've
 got


rate
 cuts
 coming
 up
 and
 then
 we're


hopefully
 going
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 damn


good
 earnings
 going
 into
 this
 week
 with


Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 and
 a
 variety
 of
 other


companies.
 the
 the
 bullcase
 still
 looks


pretty
 strong
 as
 choppy
 as
 it's
 been
 and


as
 long
 as
 that
 bullcase
 has
 room
 to


continue
 then
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 that
 aggressive
 going
 into
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 I
 think


quite
 frankly
 it's
 actually
 making
 this


year
 uh
 or
 this
 cycle
 for
 outperformance


way
 easier
 because
 now
 stocks
 aren't
 at


all-time
 highs
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 need


stocks
 to
 not
 be
 at
 all-time
 highs
 to


you
 know
 get
 another
 leg
 up.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 see
 how
 that
 plays
 out
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 end


the
 end
 of
 this
 earning
 cycle.


Dude,
 you
 guys
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


pronunciations.
 Parabbe.


I
 think
 that's
 the
 one.
 Peribe,
 right?


Peribe.
 That's
 how
 you
 say
 it.
 But
 that


is
 weird.
 I
 I I
 never
 knew
 about
 that


bank.
 And
 you
 know,
 given
 all
 the
 stuff


that
 happened
 with
 regionals,
 you
 know,


you're
 seeing
 some
 more
 bank
 issues,
 you


want
 to
 understand,
 is
 it
 an
 actual


broader
 issue?
 And
 if
 it's
 not,
 then
 you


know,
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 maybe
 too


many
 people
 have
 to
 worry
 about,
 which


is
 a
 good
 thing.
 Uh,
 all
 right,
 let's


get
 into
 some
 other
 headlines
 right


here.
 So,
 again,
 Apple
 Counterpoint


Research
 said
 that
 Apple's
 iPhone
 17


series
 outsold
 the
 iPhone
 16
 by
 14%
 in


its
 opening
 week.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 updates
 for
 Apple
 and
 getting


some
 of
 those
 more
 price
 targets
 come


in,
 which
 is
 very
 bullish
 to
 see.
 Uh,


several
 media
 reports
 saying
 that
 Trump


is
 going
 to
 be
 meeting
 with
 Kim
 Jong-un


during
 Trump's
 Asia
 trip
 for
 the
 Apex


Summit.
 By
 the
 way,
 for
 anyone
 who
 has


not
 watched
 the
 60-minute
 episode
 uh
 on


CBS,
 the
 full
 56
 minutes
 of
 it
 with


Jared
 Kushner
 yesterday
 and
 Steve


Whitoff,
 I
 I
 would
 recommend
 listening


to
 it.
 I
 listened
 to
 the
 entire
 thing


last
 night
 and
 the
 way
 they
 described


the
 diplomacy
 that
 was
 required
 to
 get


Israel
 and
 Hamas
 and
 the
 Turks
 and
 the


Egyptians
 to
 agree
 to
 some
 resemblance


of
 a
 plan.
 Will
 that
 plan
 fully
 be


executed
 over
 the
 next
 5
 years?
 And
 will


we
 actually
 have
 peace
 in
 the
 Middle


East?
 It's
 yet
 to
 be
 known.
 But
 for
 them


to
 at
 least
 agree
 to
 some
 parts
 of
 it
 to


get
 the
 war
 to
 come
 to
 a
 ceasefire,
 I


mean
 it
 is
 quite
 a
 journey.
 Quite
 a


journey
 of
 what
 they
 described.
 And
 um


Jared
 Kushner
 was
 one
 of
 the
 pivotal


figures
 that
 also
 allowed
 or
 or
 was
 you


know
 incremental
 in
 making
 the
 Trump
 uh


um
 Kim
 Jong-un
 meeting
 in
 2018
 happen.


And
 in
 2018,
 you
 know,
 Trump
 got
 a
 lot


of
 [ __ ]
 for
 for for
 stepping
 over
 the


border
 and
 meeting
 with
 Kim
 Jong-un


because,
 you
 know,
 no
 American
 president


ever
 did
 it.
 Um,
 my
 pers,
 and
 this
 is


just
 my
 perspective,
 my
 perspective
 is


like,
 hey,
 he
 got
 the
 job
 done.
 Like,
 at


at
 some
 point,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 make
 any


resemblance
 of
 peace
 across
 the
 entire


world,
 you
 have
 to
 meet
 with
 these


people.
 And,
 and
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 the


idea
 of
 like,
 do
 we
 want
 to
 make
 a
 deal


or
 not?
 There
 was
 this
 really
 good


moment
 in
 the
 CBS
 uh
 special
 where
 the


interviewer
 asked
 Jared
 Kushner
 uh
 when


you
 guys
 asked
 Trump,
 "Hey,
 if
 Hamas


wants
 to
 have
 a
 meeting,
 can
 we
 take
 a


meeting
 with
 him?"
 What
 was
 his


response?
 And
 Steve
 Whit
 was
 like,
 Trump


said,
 "Of
 course,
 take
 the
 meeting."
 Why


wouldn't
 you
 take
 the
 meeting?
 He's


like, "If
 we
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 bring


these
 hostages
 back
 home
 alive,
 why
 the


hell
 would
 we
 not
 take
 that
 meeting?"


And
 the
 reason
 it's
 so
 controversial
 is


because
 the
 United
 States
 does
 not


negotiate
 with
 terrorist
 organizations.


Hamas
 is
 a
 terrorist
 organization.
 But


you've
 got
 someone
 like
 Trump
 who's


like,
 "Okay,
 sure,
 we
 don't
 negotiate


with
 terrorist
 organizations,
 but
 these


are
 20
 hostages
 that
 we
 can
 bring
 back


to
 their
 families."
 I
 mean,
 like,
 like,


if
 we
 have
 to
 take
 the
 meeting,
 take
 the


damn
 meeting.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 getting


into
 the
 psychology
 of
 Trump,
 and
 this


is
 why,
 you
 know,
 he
 might
 be
 wanting
 to


meet
 with
 Kim
 Jong-un,
 why
 he's
 tweeting


all
 these
 things
 about
 China
 setting
 up


a
 hopefully
 stronger
 negotiation
 with
 Xi


Jinping,
 is
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


he
 wants
 to
 get
 a
 deal
 done.
 He
 wants
 to


get
 a
 deal
 done
 in
 whatever
 way
 is


possible
 to
 get
 a
 deal
 done.
 It's


actually
 making
 listening
 to
 that


60-minute
 interview
 yesterday
 made
 me


pretty
 optimistic
 that
 a
 China
 deal
 is


going
 to
 get
 done
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.


And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 back
 and
 forth


about
 soybeans
 and
 cooking
 oil
 and
 all


this
 nonsense,
 it
 is
 all
 just
 hooplot
 to


eventually
 get
 to
 a
 deal.
 And
 I
 think


the
 Chinese
 know
 this
 and
 Trump
 knows


this
 as
 well.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 just,


you
 know,
 going
 to
 react
 to
 anything


that
 happens
 whenever
 Trump
 says


something.
 But
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


get
 a
 deal.
 And
 if
 we
 get
 this
 deal


done,
 you
 know,
 that's
 obviously
 going


to
 be
 very,
 very
 good
 for
 the
 markets.


And,
 you
 know,
 any
 level
 of
 peace
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 is
 going to
 be
 good
 for
 the


markets.
 Also,
 one
 of the
 questions
 they


asked
 Steve
 Witoff
 is,
 are
 you
 guys


working
 on
 a
 deal
 with
 Russia
 and


Ukraine?
 Trump
 met
 with
 Zalinski
 on


Friday.
 That
 was
 a
 productive
 meeting.


He
 said
 he
 had
 a
 productive
 uh
 phone


call
 with
 uh
 Putin.
 You
 know,
 the
 reason


this
 matters
 for
 the
 stock
 market,
 if
 we


can
 get
 some
 level
 of
 geopolitical


stability
 across
 the
 entire
 world,


whether
 it's
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 or


whether
 it's
 in
 Russia,
 Ukraine,
 I
 mean,


that
 is
 going
 to
 aid
 to
 the
 bullcase


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 as
 long


as
 we
 have
 earnings
 growth
 as
 well.
 And


if
 we
 get
 that
 earnings
 growth,
 that's


not
 going
 to
 be
 too
 bad.
 Speaking
 of


China,
 uh
 GDP
 growth
 is
 pretty
 damn


strong.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 China's
 GDP


grew
 5.2%
 in
 Q3.
 We
 got
 these
 numbers


last
 night.
 While
 high-tech


manufacturing
 expanded
 9.6%,
 equipment


manufacturing
 rose
 9
 7%.
 Industrial


robotics
 output
 increased
 30%,
 new


energy
 vehicles
 30%
 and
 3D
 printing


equipment
 40.1%.


Despite
 the
 weakest
 GDP
 growth
 in
 a


year,
 China
 set
 its
 5%
 annual
 target


remains
 within
 reach.
 So
 the
 fact
 that


China
 is
 able
 to
 put
 up
 5%
 growth
 every


year
 or
 every
 quarter
 and
 and


potentially
 every
 year.
 You
 know,
 the


United
 States
 is
 at
 3.3
 3.5%.
 China's


also
 getting
 out
 of
 recession,
 so
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 different.
 The
 United
 States


has
 not
 really
 been
 in
 a
 recession,
 but


it
 is
 good
 to
 see
 globally
 uh
 a
 country


like
 China
 at
 least
 start
 to
 make
 some


more
 progress
 on
 their
 GDP
 growth.
 And


the
 other
 reason
 this
 is
 really


important
 is
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 GDP


growth
 is
 coming
 because
 of
 the
 US


consumer.
 And
 if
 they
 lose
 the
 US


consumer,
 they
 do
 not
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to


a
 recession


because
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 fun
 for


them
 to
 be
 stuck
 in
 what
 they
 were
 stuck


in
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.
 So
 it
 is


good
 to
 see
 China
 getting
 a
 bit
 more


momentum
 here
 and
 not
 have
 that
 much


pain.
 Is
 Amazon
 th
 Amazon
 is
 this
 week


their
 earnings?
 No,
 no,
 they're
 next


week,
 right?
 Amazon.


Yeah.
 Yeah,
 next
 week.
 Amazon
 is
 next


week
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.
 Someone
 can


correct
 me
 on
 that.
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


Amazon
 is
 this
 week
 is
 Netflix
 and
 Tesla


and
 IBM.
 And
 I
 think
 Amazon,
 Google,


Microsoft
 Metal,
 all
 those
 guys
 are
 the


week
 after.
 And
 then
 the
 week
 after


that,
 you
 have
 Palinger,
 Hood,
 all
 those


companies.
 30th,
 right?
 30th.
 Okay,


cool.
 Amit
 that
 full
 beard
 is
 making
 you


seem
 smarter.
 Dude,
 beard
 is
 growing.


It's
 coming
 back.
 It's
 coming
 back.
 It


has
 been
 two
 years
 since
 I
 think
 I
 even


grew
 it
 to
 this
 level.
 So,
 it's
 coming


back,
 bro.
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 might


have
 the
 full-on
 beard
 come
 back.
 And,


you
 know,
 when
 that
 happens,
 then
 uh


then
 then
 I
 can
 really
 get
 to
 know


Palanteer
 because,
 you
 know,
 at
 that


point


at
 that
 point,
 I'll
 be
 a
 target
 at
 that


point.
 All right.
 Anyway,
 so
 let's
 get


into
 what
 else
 is
 going
 on
 in
 the


broader
 market.
 Uh
 this
 was
 another


thing
 that
 was
 really
 important
 in


regards
 to
 Bloomberg
 in
 gold.
 So
 let's


talk
 more
 about
 gold.
 Here's
 what
 we
 got


from
 Bloomberg.
 Uh
 emerging
 markets


continue
 to
 be
 a
 top
 gold
 buyer.
 Poland


is
 actually
 the
 largest
 buyer
 of
 gold.


18.7
 metric
 tons.
 18.7
 metric
 tonses.
 I


mean
 when
 I
 found
 this
 out
 last
 night,
 I


was
 like,
 what
 is
 Poland
 doing
 buying


the
 amount
 of
 gold
 that
 they're
 buying?


And
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 that
 the
 price
 of


gold,
 which
 has
 now
 rallied
 70%.
 Look
 at


that.
 back
 above
 4,300.
 Go
 silver
 as


well,
 5246.
 That
 one
 not
 slowing
 down.


Silver's
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 54,
 but


breaking
 above
 50
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


11
 years
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 It
 means


a
 lot
 of
 these
 central
 banks
 across
 the


world
 are
 buying
 gold.
 And
 this
 chart


right
 here
 kind
 of
 continues
 to
 show


that
 the
 central
 bank
 gold
 holdings
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 the
 overall
 assets
 are
 now


over
 20%.


And
 this
 is
 the
 highest
 share
 we've
 seen


in
 nearly
 three
 decades.
 Is
 gold
 a


bubble?
 That
 is
 my
 question
 for
 the


chat.
 Is
 gold
 a
 bubble?
 Yeah,
 India
 has


not
 bought
 as
 much
 gold
 in
 Q2
 as
 Poland


did
 and
 Kazakhstan
 and
 Turkey
 and
 then


you
 have
 China,
 which
 China
 might
 be


underrepresented
 in
 their
 numbers
 a


little
 bit.
 And
 then
 the
 Czech
 Republic.


I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 quite
 incredible
 to


see
 the
 amount
 of
 money
 that
 is
 flowing


into
 gold.
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's


necessarily
 a
 bubble,
 but
 I
 would
 say


it's
 becoming
 one
 of
 those
 assets
 that


kind
 of
 is
 is
 becoming
 too
 big
 to
 fail.


Now,
 obviously,
 if
 if
 you
 get
 such
 a


level
 of
 euphoria
 into
 there
 is
 some


somewhat
 of
 a
 hiccup
 that
 happens,
 but


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 easily
 slowing


down.
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't
 easily
 slow


down,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot


more
 people
 pile
 into
 gold.
 Doug
 says,


"Of
 course,
 gold
 is
 bubble.
 Gold
 markets


will
 get
 dumped
 when
 DJT
 leaves
 the
 Oval


Office
 and
 things
 get
 sold
 off."
 Yeah,
 I


mean,
 maybe
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 Trump
 trade


right
 now.
 Maybe
 it's
 a
 central
 bank
 uh


monetary
 easing
 trade
 right
 now.
 10
 year


is
 below
 4%
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 which
 is


really
 nice
 to
 see.
 Again,
 this
 makes
 no


sense
 for
 gold
 to
 go
 up,
 which
 is


anticipating
 inflation
 and
 for
 the


10-year
 to
 go
 down,
 aka
 people
 buying


bonds
 because
 they
 are
 anticipating


deflation
 or
 at
 least
 maybe
 not


deflation,
 but
 not
 as
 high
 a
 level
 as


inflation
 as
 one
 would
 expect
 if
 gold


was
 up
 70%.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 told
 me
 two


years
 ago
 gold
 would
 be
 up
 70%
 in
 2025


and
 inflation
 at
 the
 time
 was
 what,
 8%


in
 2022.
 I
 would
 tell
 you,
 damn,
 I
 guess


we
 didn't
 solve
 inflation.
 I
 think
 the


majority
 of
 people
 when
 inflation
 was
 8%


in
 2022
 and
 you
 said,
 hey,
 I
 came
 back


from
 the
 future,
 gold
 is
 up
 70%
 in
 2025.


You
 say,
 wow,
 I
 guess
 for
 three
 years
 we


weren't
 able
 to
 get
 inflation
 to
 come


down.
 That's
 wrong.
 Inflation
 has
 come


down
 to
 2.7%.
 At
 one
 point
 it
 was
 at
 2.3


and
 gold
 is
 still
 up
 at
 its
 highest


levels
 ever.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 to
 see
 this
 playing


out,
 but
 it
 is
 playing
 out.
 Nick
 says


developing
 countries
 could
 become
 exit


liquidity.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 factions
 of
 the
 overall
 global


investor
 community
 that
 could
 become


exit
 liquidity
 on
 gold.
 The
 question
 is,


is
 there
 like
 a
 legit
 rug
 pull
 coming
 or


is
 this
 becoming
 an
 asset
 class
 that
 you


have
 to
 be
 in
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be


investing
 in
 the
 dollar
 as
 much
 as
 you


know
 people
 would
 have
 invested
 before?


Now,
 the
 dollar
 has
 been
 rel
 it's
 still


down
 10%
 year-over-year,
 but
 it's
 been


flat
 over
 the
 past
 five
 months,
 which
 is


good.
 that
 it's
 showing
 that
 the
 dollar


is
 not
 continuing
 to
 weaken.
 But
 gold


going
 up
 70%
 or
 I
 think
 gold
 is
 up
 42%


in
 the
 past
 3
 months
 and
 the
 dollar


being
 flat
 also
 is
 confusing.
 You
 would


expect
 the
 dollar
 to
 weaken
 a
 little
 bit


more
 if
 gold
 was
 going
 up
 at
 that
 rate.


Josh
 says
 you
 only
 see
 this
 level
 prior


to
 major
 conflicts.
 And
 that's
 another


thing
 like
 I
 mean
 we've
 already
 had


multiple
 major
 conflicts
 that
 are


starting
 to
 somewhat
 get
 resolved
 in


regards
 to
 the
 Middle
 East
 and


potentially
 Russia
 Ukraine.
 So
 unless


we're
 getting
 a
 World
 War
 III
 precursor


coming
 up,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 exactly


people
 are
 getting
 excited
 for
 with


gold.
 Dragon
 says
 it's
 a
 preservation
 of


wealth.
 It's
 not
 an
 investment.
 It's


insurance.
 People
 are
 betting
 against


the
 dollar.


I
 mean,
 that's
 fair,
 but
 again,
 you


know,
 this
 whole
 idea
 of
 people
 are


preserving
 their
 wealth.
 If
 gold
 falls


10%
 and
 I
 wonder
 how
 same
 thing
 with


Bitcoin,
 right?
 You
 know,
 Bitcoin
 is


seen
 as
 a
 store
 of
 value
 and
 then
 it


doesn't
 store
 your
 value
 and
 then
 people


start
 selling
 it
 off
 even
 though


eventually
 it
 ends
 up
 coming
 back.
 I


wonder
 if
 that
 same
 thing
 happens
 with


gold.
 But
 gold
 is
 indeed
 having
 its


moment
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 that


continues
 over
 the
 the
 coming
 years.
 All


right,
 we
 got
 two
 minutes
 until
 the


market
 opens.
 Let's
 do
 the
 green
 or
 red


poll.
 What
 do
 we
 think?
 Do
 we
 go
 green?


Do
 we
 go
 red?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think


based
 on
 everything
 we
 talked
 and


everything
 we
 talked
 about
 for
 the
 past


hour,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 green
 day.
 Uh,


quite
 frankly,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 green


week.
 This
 China
 stuff
 looks
 like
 it's


getting
 resolved.
 Earnings
 are
 going
 to


be
 pretty
 good.
 Earnings
 have
 already


been
 phenomenal.
 As
 long
 as
 earnings
 can


continue
 on
 this
 path.
 I
 don't
 see
 the


reason
 for
 why
 the
 markets
 have
 to
 sell


off
 this
 week.
 But
 then
 again,
 we
 also


have
 had
 a
 really
 good
 September
 October


or
 September
 August.
 uh
 you
 know
 we


might
 continue
 to
 be
 in
 a
 chopptober


versus
 October
 and
 although
 we
 might
 be


having
 a
 little
 recovery
 right
 here
 in


the
 pre-markets
 from
 some
 of
 the
 red


last
 week
 it
 might
 not
 have
 to
 continue.


So
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up


playing
 out
 but
 I
 do
 think
 I
 don't
 know


dude
 when
 you
 put
 the
 pieces
 to
 the


puzzle
 together
 China
 escalation


shouldn't
 be
 that
 aggressive.
 Earnings


growth
 should
 be
 good.
 We're
 getting
 a


rate
 cut
 in
 two
 weeks
 and
 the
 regional


banking
 crisis
 or
 whatever
 narrative
 the


market
 wanted
 to
 come
 up
 with
 to
 tank


stocks
 last
 week
 is
 just
 not
 that
 real


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 data.
 So,
 seems
 like


these
 dips
 are
 still
 opportunities
 and


now
 we
 just
 got
 to
 see
 how
 the
 market


ultimately
 interprets
 it.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 Monday,


October
 20th.
 We
 got
 11
 days
 left
 of
 the


month.
 9:30
 a.m.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 once
 again
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 S&P
 500
 opens
 up.5%
 on
 the
 day.


Green
 66791.
 Remember
 on
 Friday
 it
 was


up
 and
 down
 within
 like
 almost
 50
 uh
 50


different
 green
 red
 opens
 across
 the


board.
 There's
 a
 massive
 green
 candle


right
 there.
 668
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 We'll


see
 if
 that
 holds
 any
 momentum
 or
 if


that
 continues.
 Um
 but
 last
 week
 on


Friday
 it
 went
 up.
 It
 went
 down.
 It
 went


up
 and
 went
 down
 and
 then
 it
 completely


got
 rearranged.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if


that
 holds
 on.
 Oh,
 Legend.
 You
 guys
 just


saw
 my
 watch
 list
 disappear.


You
 guys
 just
 saw
 it
 disappear.
 Let's
 go


to
 Weeble.
 Maybe
 AWS.
 Wait,
 Weeble's


having
 problems
 for
 you
 guys
 now
 as


well.


Oh,
 let
 me
 see.
 Let
 me
 see.
 Those
 AWS


issues
 might
 be
 back,
 but
 let's
 go to


Weeble.
 Okay,
 S&P
 still
 moving
 668.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 We
 are
 green.
 That's
 up


half%
 of
 the
 day.

 That's

 Oh,
 they're

 down.
 They're


all
 down.


Damn,
 bro.
 AWS,
 I
 thought
 the
 problems


were
 resolved.
 They
 should
 have
 been


fixed
 like
 an
 hour
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 they


were
 fixed
 an
 hour.
 We
 were
 literally


just
 looking
 at
 the
 chart
 like
 30


seconds
 ago.
 Okay,
 I
 think
 Robin's
 back.


I
 think
 Robin's
 back
 or
 Weeble's
 done.


Weeble's
 done.
 Robin
 Hood
 should
 be


back.
 Okay,
 S&P
 that's
 up.5%.
 AMD,


that's
 up
 2%.
 SoFi,
 that's
 up
 three.


Google,
 that's
 up
 half
 percent.
 Grab


that's
 up
 2%.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 back


over
 4,000
 and
 110,000.
 TLT,
 that's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Circle,
 that's
 up
 2.5.
 Uh,


Micro
 Strategy,
 that's
 up
 2.97.
 YouTube


just
 crashed
 for
 you
 a
 minute
 ago.
 Wow.


Yeah,
 you're
 getting
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 issues
 throughout
 the
 day.


Roblox,
 that's
 up
 1%.
 Crowd
 Strike,


that's
 up
 1.3.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 okay,
 there


was
 something
 we
 didn't
 talk
 about
 in


the
 pre-markets,
 but
 the
 secretary
 of
 um


the
 secretary
 of
 transportation
 came
 on


CNBC
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 and
 uh
 he
 said


that
 SpaceX
 is
 behind
 on
 the
 contract


that
 was
 initially
 awarded
 to
 them
 to


get
 back
 to
 the
 moon.
 And
 so,
 he
 is


opening
 up
 the
 contract
 for
 any
 space


company
 to
 bid,
 including
 Blue
 Origin.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 up


3%
 right
 here
 because
 if
 they
 bid
 to


potentially
 get
 back
 to
 the
 moon,
 I
 mean


that
 would
 be
 a
 massive
 contract
 for
 a


company
 of
 their
 scale.
 And
 you
 know,


Sean
 Duffy,
 he
 didn't
 hesitate
 to
 say


that
 SpaceX
 is
 being
 slow
 and
 it
 was


kind
 of
 a
 public
 call
 out
 for
 other


companies
 to
 compete
 for
 this.
 So
 that


could
 be
 a
 reason
 why
 Rocklab's
 getting


some
 momentum.
 ESTs
 as
 well.
 This
 was
 84


in
 the
 pre-markets.

 A

 very


weird,
 but

 now.

 if

 Uh,
 let
 me
 go
 back
 to

 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 load
 something


up.
 Weeble
 is
 not
 loading
 anything


either.
 Damn,
 bro.
 AWS
 controls
 the


internet.


AWS
 controls
 the
 internet.
 This
 is
 wild.


This
 is
 wild.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 see
 if
 we


can
 go
 to
 another
 website
 and
 see
 if
 we


can
 get
 some
 of these
 tickers.
 Um,


Trading
 View,
 is
 that
 working?


Kind
 of.
 Trading
 View
 is
 working.
 Not
 as


much.
 Let
 me
 go
 back
 to
 Weeble,
 see
 if


we
 got
 some
 Thinker
 Swim
 works.


Yeah,
 Chad
 right
 there.
 AWS


uh
 outage
 in
 the
 East
 Coast,
 dude.
 But
 I


I
 thought
 it
 was
 resolved
 a
 couple
 hours


ago
 because
 everything
 was
 working.
 But


I
 guess
 there
 is
 still
 some
 pain
 right


here.
 It
 It's
 like
 working
 on
 Robin.


It's
 just
 slow.
 It's
 just
 like
 really


slow.
 Now
 it's
 getting
 back
 to
 a
 little


bit
 normal.
 Nvidia,
 that's
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Where
 is
 Amazon
 with
 this?


Amazon's
 actually
 up
 on
 this
 214.
 So,


Amazon
 not
 losing
 too
 much
 pain


from
 this,
 but
 it's
 green.
 Chat
 says


there
 was
 a
 mitigation
 put
 in
 place.


All right,
 so
 hopefully
 it
 doesn't
 end


up
 continuing
 throughout
 the
 entire
 day.


PayPal
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 1%.


Salesforce
 up
 1.6.
 And
 the
 meta,
 that's


up
 1%
 as
 well.
 Fidelity
 and
 Schwab
 are


working
 good.
 All
 right.
 So,
 it
 seems


like
 Weeble,
 Hood,
 and
 Yahoo
 Finance
 are


some
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 that
 are
 affected


by
 this.
 S&P
 though,
 look
 at
 that.
 668,


folks.
 If
 we
 get
 back
 to
 670,
 all-time


highs
 were
 673
 before
 this
 whole
 China


disaster
 started
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 back


and
 forth
 of
 rhetorical,


I
 guess,
 insults
 towards
 one
 another,


which
 have
 started
 to
 deescalate.
 That


happened
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 673
 is


not
 that
 far
 away.
 If
 we
 can
 get
 back


above
 670,
 that
 would
 be
 very
 nice
 to


see.
 BMR.
 We'll
 see
 how
 that
 one
 loads


up.
 SMCI
 56.
 All right.
 SMCI,
 that
 XAI


contract
 being
 a
 rumor
 and
 getting
 that


one
 to
 be


a
 bit
 more
 exciting.
 Legend


unfortunately
 is
 not
 loading
 or
 it's


very
 slow.
 Bit
 mine.
 5213.


5213.
 Why
 is
 Nvidia
 red?
 I'm
 not
 even


sure
 why
 Nvidia's
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 I


mean,
 Jensen
 had
 a
 really
 good
 interview


on
 Fox
 yesterday.
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 people


to
 understand
 the
 broader
 Nvidia
 thesis.


However,


it
 is
 Nvidia
 and
 it
 goes
 up
 and
 down
 for


random
 reasons.
 It
 is
 weird
 though


because
 all
 the
 semis
 are
 green.
 I
 mean,


pretty
 much
 all
 the
 semis
 including


Micron,
 SMCI,
 etc.
 are
 green
 and
 so
 not


sure
 why
 Nvidia
 isn't
 really
 following


here.


That
 one
 is
 red.


Um,


okay.
 Okay,
 I
 think
 we
 just
 maybe
 we


switch
 to
 Trading
 View
 for
 now
 to
 look


at
 some
 of
 these
 charts
 because


otherwise


this
 stuff
 is
 being
 a
 bit
 weird
 now.
 I


don't
 use
 Trading
 View
 like
 crazy,


but
 let's
 pull
 it
 up.
 We'll
 just
 search


the
 tickers.
 I
 don't
 have
 watch
 list
 on


this.
 I
 guess
 I
 should
 set
 up
 watch
 list


as
 a
 backup
 on
 Trading
 View
 just
 in
 case


this
 stuff
 happens.
 So,
 here's
 Amazon


right
 here.
 21448.
 That
 one's
 still


green.
 Uh
 Palanteer
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 red
 as
 well.


Palanteer
 one.
 12
 pounder
 just
 went


green
 17863
 that's
 up
 slightly
 as
 we


open
 app
 loven
 that's
 dumping
 not
 sure


why
 apploven
 is
 dumping
 I
 mean
 the
 SEC


probe
 continues
 to
 be
 an
 issue
 these


guys
 were
 at
 610
 last
 week
 app
 wow
 down


4%
 right
 back
 down
 to
 575
 I
 took
 a
 swing


trade
 on
 this
 at
 578
 sold
 it
 at
 598
 this


one
 not
 really
 getting
 back
 above
 those


levels
 574


at
 these
 areas
 Baba
 how
 is
 China
 doing


right
 here
 that's
 at
 168
 down
 a
 little


bit.


Um,


okay.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 Legend
 is
 getting


back
 to
 normal.
 No,
 Legend
 still
 sucks.


Dude,


AWS
 really
 took
 the
 M.
 Okay,
 so
 it's


annoying
 for
 like
 the
 stream
 because
 we


can't
 see
 the
 stocks,
 but
 I
 would


imagine
 people
 that
 are
 trying
 to
 trade


are
 way
 more
 annoyed
 because


they
 might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 access
 their


positions.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 anyone's


having
 some.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 just


logged
 on
 to
 the
 brokerage.
 barely


loading.


I
 mean,
 not
 the
 best
 look,
 dude.
 Uh,


obviously,
 you
 know,
 Hood
 is
 going
 to


blame
 Amazon
 for
 this,
 which
 they


should,
 but
 nonetheless,
 it
 is
 dicey


when
 people
 can't
 get
 out
 of
 these


positions.
 Same
 thing
 for
 Weeble.
 You


got
 a
 lot
 of
 traders
 on
 Weeble.
 SoFi


chart
 barely
 loading
 on
 Weeble
 still.


Ethereum
 is
 not
 even
 loading
 either.


Weeble's
 frozen
 again.


Some
 of
 you
 guys
 saying
 my
 Robin
 is
 just


fine.


It
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 freaking


important
 some
 of
 these
 companies
 are.
 I


mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 like,
 and


again,
 Robin
 had
 put
 out
 a
 notice
 on


their
 app
 that
 AWS
 was
 having
 issues,


and
 they
 said
 the
 the
 the
 issues
 have


been
 resolved
 like
 an
 hour
 ago.
 So,
 the


fact
 that
 the
 issues
 came
 back
 just
 goes


to
 show
 how
 aggressive
 might
 be.
 Hoodie


is
 up
 4%
 row
 1358
 or
 13482.
 So,
 that's


green.


And
 then
 S&P
 66885
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


669.


Chad
 says,
 "And
 it
 shows
 how
 fragile


most
 software
 is."
 Yeah,


it
 shows
 how
 fragile
 most
 software
 ends


up
 becoming
 and
 why
 companies
 actually


have
 to
 pay
 to
 get
 quality.
 Now
 again,


if
 you're
 not
 in
 the
 Northeast,
 you


might
 not
 be
 having
 these
 issues.
 I


think
 it
 is
 isolated
 to
 Amazon


Northeast,
 which
 is
 a
 big
 section
 of
 the


country,
 but
 obviously
 if
 you're
 not
 in


the
 Northeast,
 you're
 probably
 not


having


that
 many
 issues.
 Um,
 Bitcoin
 110,
 SoFi


2740,
 Hood
 13494,
 Nvidia
 still
 flat
 on


the
 day
 or
 sorry,
 Red
 on
 the
 day,
 Bank


of
 America
 that's
 down,
 and
 then
 Morgan


Stanley
 that's
 up
 1.16%.


Ethereum
 at least
 above
 for
 that.
 It's


bad
 in
 Texas,
 too.


Oh
 [ __ ]


Wait,
 no.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 just


Northeast.


Oh,
 but
 if
 all
 the
 ser
 Oh,
 if
 all
 the


services
 run
 on
 Northeast
 servers,
 it


doesn't
 matter.
 If
 you're
 located
 in
 the


Northeast,
 your
 shit's
 still
 going
 to


get
 hurt.
 Ah,
 okay,
 that
 makes
 sense.


Northeast
 is
 just
 where
 the
 servers
 are.


Oh,
 I'm
 stupid.
 I
 thought
 if
 you're
 in


the
 Northeast,
 it
 has
 an
 impact.
 But
 if


the
 servers
 are
 in
 the
 Northeast,
 you


know,
 doesn't
 matter
 where
 the
 hell
 you


live.
 Okay.
 So,
 Houston's
 having
 issues.


Kansas
 is
 bad.
 Miami
 is
 bad.


All right.
 [ __ ]
 So,
 what
 do
 we
 talk


about
 then?
 What
 do
 we
 You
 guys
 want
 to


hear
 some
 jokes?


I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 your
 boy
 is
 is


entering
 his
 comedian
 arc.
 I'm
 trying
 to


trying
 to
 trying
 to
 test
 out
 some


material.
 Anyway,
 down
 in
 Arkansas,
 down


in
 San
 Diego,
 down
 in
 so
 down
 in


Scotland,


down
 in
 Greece.
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


Freaking
 Amazon.


This
 stock
 should
 be
 freaking
 down
 10%.


Let
 us
 buy
 it
 cheaper
 if
 it's
 going
 to


wreck
 the
 entire
 world.
 Goodness


gracious.
 Down
 in
 Memphis,


down
 in
 Wisconsin,
 down
 in
 Norway.
 Dude,


I'm
 really
 stupid.
 I
 when
 I
 saw


northeast
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 if
 you
 live
 in


the
 northeast
 you
 have
 some
 problems
 but


if
 you're
 anywhere
 else
 you're
 okay.
 No


it's
 like
 the
 servers
 are
 in
 the


northeast
 for
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 world


or
 potentially
 for
 a
 majority
 of
 a
 lot


of
 places
 in
 the
 world
 and
 it
 could


obviously
 affect
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 world
 at


that
 point.
 AMD
 236
 SoFi
 that's
 up
 3.5%.


Any
 statement
 from
 AWS?
 You
 know
 I


didn't
 see
 anything
 in
 the
 morning.


Let's
 see
 if
 they
 tweeted
 anything
 about


it.
 Surprisingly,
 Twitter
 is
 not
 down
 as


much.
 So,
 I
 guess
 maybe
 some
 of
 their


servers
 aren't
 isolated
 in
 in
 the


Northeast.
 No,
 they
 haven't.
 Dude,


they're
 tweeting
 about
 this
 random
 dude


talking
 about
 advancing
 DevOps
 with


Amazon
 Nova.
 No
 one
 cares
 about
 that


[ __ ]
 dude.
 We
 want
 to
 want
 to
 just
 get


our
 internet
 back
 to
 normal.


This
 could
 give
 Microsoft
 even
 a
 bigger


pump
 potentially.
 I'm
 surprised
 Amazon


hasn't
 come
 out
 and
 said
 anything
 about


this
 either.
 That
 is
 kind
 of
 weird.
 SMCI


up
 7%.


That's
 getting
 some
 love.
 Yeah,
 that
 was


three
 days
 ago.
 That
 tweet
 is
 old,
 too.


They
 haven't
 even
 updated.
 Micro


Strategy
 is
 up
 3.6.
 And
 then
 Microsoft,


that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.


Uh,
 X
 doesn't
 use
 AWS
 for
 their
 primary


services.
 Okay,
 that
 makes
 sense.


Hood
 is
 working
 fine
 for
 you.
 Legend's


okay.
 I
 mean,
 let
 me
 search
 Uber.


No,
 look
 at
 that.
 I
 can't
 even
 get
 to


the
 Uber.
 It
 won't
 even
 search
 it
 up.


It
 takes
 a
 good
 minute
 for
 it
 to
 show


up.
 That's
 crazy,
 bro.
 We
 are
 so


accustomed
 to
 speed
 and
 efficiency
 in


2025.
 Like,
 we
 just
 need
 it
 to
 happen.


And
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 you
 know,
 we
 start


complaining
 and
 these
 tech
 companies


usually
 live
 up
 to
 the
 challenge
 to


support
 us.
 But
 when
 they
 don't,
 all


hell
 breaks
 loose.
 Nvidia
 right
 there,


1827.


That
 is
 also
 trying
 to
 break
 out
 to
 go


green.
 Rocket
 Lab
 70.


Rocket
 Lab.
 Okay,
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Again,


that
 NSA
 deal
 or
 the
 that
 NASA
 opening


up
 with
 the
 contract
 is
 definitely


something
 that's
 getting
 the
 market


excited.
 There
 you
 go.
 Back
 to
 70
 70.10


on
 Rocket
 Lab.


Just
 restart
 your
 computer.
 Exactly.


Chad
 says,
 "Think
 about
 all
 the


manufacturing
 companies
 running
 their


SAP
 instance
 in
 US
 East
 one
 and
 can't


operate."
 Yeah,
 dude.
 We're
 talking


about
 a
 market
 open
 that's
 having
 some


issues.


I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 companies


out
 there
 that
 have
 much
 more


important
 things
 to
 be
 doing
 right
 now


that
 likely
 can't
 operate.


That
 is
 wild,
 bro.
 the
 some
 of
 these
 I


mean
 crowd
 strike
 proved
 it
 to
 us
 back


in
 August
 of
 2024


and
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 well


we're
 going
 to
 see
 but
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 it's
 as
 aggressive
 as
 the
 crowd


strike
 outage
 was
 but


it
 it
 is
 it
 is
 just
 a
 reminder
 of
 how


technologically
 intertwined
 the
 entire


world
 is
 so
 right
 they're
 up
 4%


and
 how
 fragile
 systems
 of
 software
 are


as
 well
 that's
 up
 1%
 Na'vi
 breaking
 17


this
 one
 hasn't
 had
 an
 incredible
 run.


Jose's
 only
 warning
 about
 this
 was
 that


make
 sure
 that
 on
 earnings
 they
 actually


give
 you
 specific
 details
 about
 their


partnership
 with
 Nvidia
 because
 if
 they


don't
 that's
 where
 the
 streak
 can
 get
 a


little
 iffy
 but
 right
 now
 the
 stock
 has


basically
 gone
 from
 9
 to
 17
 on
 a


narrative
 rerating
 with
 their
 work
 with


Nvidia
 and
 so
 earnings
 will
 be
 important


for
 them.
 The
 VIX
 is
 down
 6%
 that's
 also


really
 nice
 to
 see
 the
 VIX
 taking
 a
 hit


and
 then
 TFC
 another
 regional
 bank


that's
 up
 1%.


Elon's
 clowning
 AWS
 on
 X.


Yeah,
 I
 mean,


I
 would
 imagine
 GCP
 and
 Microsoft
 try
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 this
 in
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 ways
 potentially
 by
 luring


people
 off
 of
 AWS.
 It
 also
 goes
 to
 show


how
 massive
 AWS
 is
 compared
 to
 some
 of


those
 other
 guys.
 Like,
 this
 is
 not
 the


first
 time
 AWS
 has
 had
 issues.
 I
 mean,


Google
 literally
 had
 issues
 a
 week
 ago,


right,
 when
 YouTube
 shut
 down.
 But
 uh


when
 AWS
 goes
 down,
 the
 entire
 world


feels
 it.
 Reddit
 is
 up
 5%
 and
 then


Amazon's
 still
 up
 half
 a
 percent


right
 there.


Um


yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 saying
 my
 app
 is


not
 working.


Most
 of
 Amazon.com
 is
 running
 on
 Dynamo


DB,
 AWS,
 Perplexity,
 Snapchat,
 Fortnite,


Air
 Table,
 Canva,
 Amazon
 Slack,
 half
 the


internet
 is
 affected.


Damn,
 that's
 wild,
 dude.
 There
 must
 be
 I


mean,
 this
 could
 also
 affect
 the
 market


right
 here
 because
 there
 might
 be
 people


that
 are
 trying
 to
 make
 trades
 or
 they


they
 can't
 make
 trades
 and
 as
 a
 result,


you
 might
 just
 not
 have
 certain
 types
 of


liquidity
 entering
 the
 market
 right
 now


and
 those
 trades
 might
 be
 affected
 for


later
 throughout


throughout
 the
 day.
 I
 mean,
 I
 would


imagine
 a
 bunch
 of
 hedge
 funds
 also
 run


a
 lot
 of
 services
 on
 something
 like
 AWS.


Ethereum
 right
 there
 4,000.
 S&P
 trying


to
 break
 669.
 We
 touched
 it
 for
 a


second.
 Couldn't
 hold
 on
 to
 it.
 Amazon


still
 at
 214.


And
 then
 Google
 at
 least
 breaking
 255.


Yeah,
 Hood
 stock
 not
 affected
 by
 this,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 saying
 you


can't
 make
 trades.


And
 I
 mean,
 let
 me
 try
 to
 reload
 my


Robin
 Hood
 app.
 It
 was
 barely
 loading


before.
 Yeah,
 it's
 barely
 loading.


Now,
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Ethereum
 bulls


come
 out
 and
 they
 were
 like,
 well,


Ethereum
 never
 has
 downtime
 and
 this
 is


the
 bull
 case
 for
 Ethereum.
 And
 like,


okay,
 that's
 fine,
 but
 Ethereum
 also


doesn't
 handle
 the
 type
 of
 workloads


that
 AWS
 handles.
 Like,
 like
 look,
 I


like
 Ethereum
 too,
 but
 a
 lot
 of these


Ethmaxes
 are
 like,
 this
 is
 why
 you
 need


a
 distributed
 decentralized
 server


process
 to,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 like,
 bro,


shut
 up.
 like
 like


a
 decentralized
 ecosystem
 like
 Ethereum


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 managing
 half
 the


internet.
 Like
 what
 are
 we
 talking
 about


here?


But
 it
 does
 mean
 that
 when
 Amazon
 does,


we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 know
 the
 [ __ ]


doesn't
 get
 hit.
 Robin
 right
 there
 13566


still
 going
 up.
 I'm
 surprised
 Hood
 stock


is
 up.
 You
 would
 think
 it
 would
 be


getting
 hit
 just
 based
 on
 the
 weakness


and
 the
 the
 app
 being
 able
 to
 function


right
 now,
 but
 that
 one's
 still
 moving.


AMCO
 as
 well
 got
 the
 Jensen
 mentioned


that's
 up
 4%.
 Grabs
 up
 1%.
 Oaklo


up
 another
 1%
 as
 well.


Um,


Coinbase
 is
 also
 down
 by
 the
 way.
 So,


Coinbase
 is
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 if
 you
 guys


have
 any
 issues
 with
 Coinbase,
 but
 in


the
 morning
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 having


issues
 on
 Coinbase.


Shopify,


can't
 see
 that
 stock
 right
 now.
 Nvidia,


wait,
 what
 about
 Google?
 Could
 I
 just
 go


to
 Google
 to
 look
 at
 some
 of
 these


stocks?
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to,
 right?


Yeah.
 Okay,
 I
 guess
 we're
 going to
 go
 to


Google.


Shop
 is
 up
 3.3.
 Dude,
 Google
 needs
 to


build
 like
 a
 Weeble
 competitor
 or
 like
 a


like
 like
 a
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 they
 have


Google
 Finance,
 but


Well,
 this
 is
 I
 don't
 use
 this
 too
 much,


but
 if
 they
 could
 design
 something
 with


like
 a
 watch
 list
 that
 is
 similar
 to


Weeble
 or
 something
 or
 even
 Legend,
 that


would
 be
 pretty
 cool.


Yeah,
 I've
 never
 used
 this
 one
 before.


This
 is
 the
 classic
 one.


Palunteer
 17826.


Um,


Google
 has
 a
 15-minute
 delay.
 Well,
 no,


I
 think
 that
 delay
 started
 to
 get
 fixed


after
 a
 couple
 of


couple
 of
 adjustments
 they
 made
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks


because
 now
 you
 see
 the
 tickers
 update


in
 real
 time.
 Here's
 the
 heat
 map
 for


what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 I
 guess
 Finn


Wiz
 doesn't
 run
 on
 AWS,
 but
 uh,


everything's
 pretty
 much
 green
 across


the
 board.
 Apple,
 Amazon,
 Tesla,
 Google


Meta,
 Broadcom,
 Nvidia
 is
 the
 only
 one


that's
 down.
 Microsoft's
 up.
 I
 mean,


look,
 this
 is
 a
 pretty
 green
 day
 to


start
 the
 market.
 Applovin's
 down
 and


Oracle
 is
 down
 and
 Qualcomm.
 Outside
 of


that,
 everything
 else
 is
 green.
 Yeah,


Snapchat's
 not
 working
 either.
 That


happened
 in
 the
 pre-market
 as
 well.


Okay.
 Is
 Weeble
 coming
 back
 a
 little


bit?
 No,
 Weeble's
 still
 dead.
 Let's
 see


if
 Legend's
 coming
 back
 a
 little
 bit.


All right.
 Legend
 is
 getting
 way
 faster.


At
 least
 searching
 on
 the
 tickers
 is


faster.
 AMD,
 that's
 up
 1.2.
 So,
 that's


up
 five.
 Google,
 that's
 up
 one.
 Grab,


that's
 up
 1.4.
 Baba,
 that's
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Only
 update
 on
 Grabb
 is
 their


COO
 did
 an
 interview
 over
 the
 weekend.


This
 is
 like
 the
 seventh
 interview
 that


executives
 have
 been
 doing
 in
 the
 past


month.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


engaging
 with
 the
 media
 more
 means
 that,


you
 know,
 they're
 ready
 to
 start
 uh


bringing
 the
 company
 more
 into
 the


public
 and
 that
 should
 be
 good
 for
 the
 Q


for
 Q3
 results.
 But
 ultimately,
 we're


going to
 have
 to
 see.
 Yep.
 Legend
 just


died
 on
 me.


Legend
 just
 died
 on
 me.


It's
 coming
 back
 slowly.


It's
 wild,
 bro.
 Absolutely
 wild.
 Rockab


at
 least
 is
 still
 making
 its
 move
 again


based
 on
 this
 idea
 that
 uh


NASA
 contracts
 are
 going
 to
 open
 up
 to


go
 back
 to
 the
 moon.
 Bit
 mine
 5352


that's
 up
 7%.


SoFi


28.


I
 have
 not
 bought
 my
 shares
 yet.
 I
 was


thinking
 of
 buying
 more
 in
 the
 low
 27s.


We'll
 see
 if
 we
 have
 a
 chance
 throughout


the
 week.
 If
 not,
 we'll
 pull
 the


trigger.
 But
 SoFi
 right
 there,
 at least


that
 is
 up
 5%
 on
 the
 day.


No
 one
 can
 sell
 anything.
 So
 stocks
 only


go
 up.
 You
 know
 that
 it's
 a
 joke,
 but


that's
 also
 like
 legit.
 Like
 if
 people


can't
 sell,
 you
 might
 have
 nothing
 else


to
 do
 but
 have
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 go


higher.
 But
 that
 means
 they
 might
 end
 up


selling
 when
 the
 services
 come
 back
 and


you
 could
 have
 a
 big
 intraday
 intraday


swing.


Um,
 okay,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right


here.


This
 is
 a
 link


to
 Amazon
 services
 and
 the
 health
 of


these
 services.


Oh,
 here
 are
 all
 the
 updates.


What
 time
 is
 it
 right
 now?
 It's
 9.


Okay,
 so
 this
 was
 8
 minutes
 ago.
 We
 have


applied
 multiple
 mitigations
 across


availability
 zones
 in
 US
 East1
 and
 are


still
 experiencing
 elevated
 errors
 for


new
 EC2
 instance
 launches.
 We
 are
 rate


limiting
 new
 instance
 launches
 to
 aid


recovery.
 We
 will
 provide
 an
 update
 at


7:30
 which
 is
 10:30
 or
 sooner
 if
 we
 have


additional
 information.


Damn,
 bro.
 That's
 wild.


That's
 wild.


Yeah.
 This
 is
 also
 why
 when
 the
 when
 the


socialists
 are
 like,
 "Hey,
 we
 need
 to


nationalize
 everything."
 It's
 like,
 bro,


if
 private
 companies
 are
 having
 these


type
 of
 issues,
 you
 think
 the


government's
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 operate


distributed
 servers
 across
 the
 world,


it's
 Amazon
 or
 bust,
 bro.
 This
 shit's


either
 going
 to
 work


or
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 work.
 Chat
 says,


"An
 AWS
 region
 is
 actually
 dozens
 of


data
 centers
 in
 that
 region.
 Each
 is


called
 an
 availability
 zone.
 So,
 even


though
 they
 fixed
 the
 root
 cause,
 the


coming
 back
 online
 is
 hampered.


All
 right.
 Well,
 Chad,
 thank
 you
 for


helping
 explain
 this
 to
 us.
 Uh,
 pounder


right
 there
 17912.
 It's
 coming
 back


slowly,
 but
 still
 a
 bit
 slower
 than


expected.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 21465.


Is
 SoFi
 having
 issues?
 I
 don't
 use
 SoFi,


but
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat.
 I
 think


most
 of
 you
 I
 mean,
 let
 me
 know
 if


anyone's
 having
 issues
 with
 SoFi.
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 necessarily
 having


too
 many
 issues.


But
 I
 don't
 use
 the
 app,
 so
 I'm
 not


sure.
 So
 right
 there,
 448.
 No,
 Tesla's


448.
 SoFi's
 at
 28.
 Noi
 issues.
 Okay,
 so


is
 not
 having
 problems.
 Didn't
 SoFi
 just


announced
 a
 partnership
 with
 Amazon,


though?
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 they
 use
 it,


but
 or
 use
 it
 yet,
 but
 they
 announced


something
 with
 AWS
 like
 two
 days
 ago,


which
 leads
 me
 to
 believe
 they
 might
 be


using
 it.
 Oh,
 a
 Galo
 announced
 something


with
 AWS.
 Okay,
 maybe
 that's
 not
 the


actual
 Invest
 app
 itself.


Yeah,
 Fidelity,
 Schwab,
 and
 JP
 Morgan


along
 with
 E
 Trade
 and
 SoFi
 look
 like


they're
 good.
 Weeble
 Hood
 are
 the
 main


ones
 that
 got
 hit.


The
 main
 ones
 that
 got
 hit.
 Apple's
 at


259.
 Again,
 the
 street
 is
 very
 excited


about
 this
 iPhone
 17
 upgrade
 cycle.
 Oil


down
 another
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Let
 me
 know


if
 you've
 bought
 iPhone
 17s


or
 any
 version
 of
 the
 iPhone
 17.
 Um,
 I


mean,
 Counterpoint
 Research
 saying
 that


the
 first
 10
 days
 is
 up
 14%
 compared
 to


iPhone
 16.
 That
 is
 a
 massive
 move
 for


something
 like
 Amazon
 or
 for
 something


like
 Apple
 and
 you
 know,
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 see
 some
 share
 of
 performance


if
 they
 can
 deliver
 results.
 This
 is


what
 Robin
 had
 said
 at
 4
 a.m.
 AWS,
 one


of
 our
 thirdparty
 vendors,
 is


experiencing
 an
 outage
 which
 is


affecting
 Robinet
 services.
 We're
 aware


of
 the
 issue
 and
 we
 will
 update
 once


resolved.
 So,
 that
 was
 at
 4
 am,
 but


still
 some
 of
 those
 issues
 are
 there.


Wow,
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 you
 saying
 yes.


bought
 the
 new
 phone.
 It
 really
 looks


like
 it
 was
 an
 upgrade
 cycle
 for
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 people
 that
 were
 on


like
 iPhone
 14,
 iPhone
 15.
 Apple,
 right?


They're
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Look
 at
 that.


Potentially
 breaking
 260.
 Dude,
 when


this
 thing
 was
 at
 180,
 how
 many
 people


thought
 it
 would
 easily
 in
 the
 next


three
 months
 get
 up
 to
 260.
 I
 mean,
 this


thing
 was
 in
 the
 gutter.


Fortunately,
 we
 have
 it
 in
 the
 stock


draft
 right
 here.
 Update
 on
 that
 is
 Matt


is
 up
 50%.


Goodness,
 he's
 crossed
 50
 all
 time.
 I'm


at
 37.
 We're
 up
 um
 30%
 on
 Apple.
 Steve's


at
 eight,
 Tanner's
 at
 21,
 Chris
 is
 at


11.


ABCL,
 Rocket
 Lab,
 ASTS,


and
 Celsius
 are
 the
 big
 big
 winners
 from


that.


People
 with
 iPhone
 14,
 15
 have
 had


enough
 battery
 performance
 decline
 they


need
 to
 get
 a
 new
 phone.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


that's
 why
 I
 got
 the
 iPhone
 16.
 My
 15


was
 just
 getting
 ridiculous
 and
 I
 had
 to


end
 up
 leaving.
 SMCI,
 that's
 up
 7%.


Uh,
 Loheed
 Martin,
 that's
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 IBKR
 doesn't
 look
 like
 people
 are


having
 too
 many
 issues
 with
 IBKR
 either.


That's
 up.


And
 then
 TTD
 is
 up.
 Hoodie
 still
 up
 5%


on
 the
 day
 even
 with
 this
 AWS
 issue.


This
 thing
 got
 to
 122
 last
 week.
 So,
 you


are
 seeing


a
 little
 bit
 more
 excitement
 right
 now.


Yes,
 Adver
 does
 have
 a
 290
 Apple
 price


target.
 They've
 always
 been
 pretty


bullish
 on
 Apple.
 And
 then
 there
 was


another
 bank,
 I
 forgot
 the
 name
 of
 the


bank,
 but
 they
 came
 out
 with
 a
 freaking


three
 uh


was
 it
 320?
 No,
 319
 price
 target.
 310


price
 target
 as
 well.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 what
 other
 headlines


that
 we
 have.
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 at
 11:00
 a.m.
 today.
 Not
 sure


why,
 but
 he'll
 be
 speaking
 at
 11:00
 a.m.


Um,


we
 talked
 about
 the
 China
 GDP
 forecast.


Goldman
 Sachs
 projecting
 a.3%
 CPI
 rise


for
 September
 with
 core
 inflation
 at


3.1%.
 So,
 they're
 expecting
 it
 to
 not
 be


up
 as
 aggressively
 as
 some
 of
 the
 other


targets
 have.
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 break


even
 right
 there.
 S&P
 669
 high
 of
 day
 on


the
 S&P.
 Nebus,
 are
 we
 getting
 a
 dump?


Nebas
 is
 getting
 a
 dump.
 112.
 How
 about


Cororeweave?


Um,


Corewave
 134,
 that's
 also
 down
 2%.


That
 is
 also
 down
 2%.


Yeah,
 dude.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 having


issues
 with
 Weeble
 as
 well.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 my
 phone
 loads
 up.


Broken.
 So,
 Legend
 is
 a
 little
 bit


faster.
 Phone
 still
 bad.


Phone's
 still
 bad.
 Can't
 buy
 or
 sell.


Can't
 buy
 or
 sell
 AMD.
 Is
 that
 one


green?
 AMD
 was
 at
 240
 last
 week.
 AMD


237.


Dude,
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 use
 Weeble
 just


based
 on
 the
 comments
 I'm
 seeing
 of
 the


amount
 of
 people
 complaining
 about


Weeble.
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 many
 people


use
 Weeble.
 Decent
 chunk
 of
 you
 guys


getting
 annoyed
 with
 this
 Weeble
 thing.


Oh,
 Trump's
 meeting
 with
 the
 Australian


prime
 minister
 at
 11
 a.m.
 Okay,
 cool.


So,


I
 guess
 we'll
 be
 having
 a
 meeting
 then.


Silver
 and
 gold.
 Oh,
 they're
 talking


about
 Robin
 Hood
 on
 CBC
 right
 now.
 Let's


switch
 over
 to
 them.
 See
 what
 they're


saying.
 Silver
 and
 gold
 are
 slightly
 up


for
 the
 day.
 They
 were
 down
 on
 Friday


after
 the
 China
 stuff.
 It
 was
 so
 weird.


Gold
 and
 silver
 went
 down
 when
 the
 China


stuff
 deescalated
 last
 week,
 but
 now


they're
 up,
 but
 the
 China
 stuff
 still


deescalated
 based
 on
 what
 Trump
 said


last
 night.
 So,


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 a
 weird


trade
 that's
 going
 in
 a
 variety
 of


different
 directions.


Okay,
 let's
 see
 what
 they're
 saying


here.


uh
 that
 I
 would
 say
 everything
 that's


contrary
 to
 investing


a
 lot
 of
 it's
 based
 there
 and
 it's


because
 of
 younger
 people
 and
 I
 think


they
 offer
 such
 a
 great
 IRA
 plan.
 They


they've
 done
 everything
 they
 can
 to
 be


as
 responsible
 as
 possible
 but
 people


just
 go
 there
 and
 they
 buy
 this
 is
 where


all
 the
 rare
 earth
 is
 bought
 and
 the


nuke
 is
 bought.


>> Okay,
 so
 Kramer's
 complaining
 that


retail
 is
 basically
 buying
 stupid
 [ __ ]


on
 Robin
 Hood.
 Look,
 he's
 not
 totally


wrong.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 probably
 a
 decent


chunk
 of
 uh
 people
 buying
 the
 stuff


that's
 been
 rallying
 for
 no
 reason
 on


Hood,
 but
 I
 also
 don't
 think
 that's
 not


happening.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 the
 top
 five


stocks
 that
 were
 bought
 in
 September
 on


Schwab,
 Nvidia,
 Meta,
 Palenteer,
 Amazon,


and
 Open.
 So


like
 if
 the
 Schwab
 people
 are
 buying
 it


was
 a
 top
 five
 stock
 in
 September
 Openor


on
 Schwab
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little


lazy
 to
 say
 all
 the
 buying
 is
 happening


on
 Robin
 Hood.
 Not
 saying
 that
 there's


not
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 loading
 up
 on
 Oaklow


on
 Robin
 Hood.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 only
 Robin
 Hood.
 Now
 five


years
 ago
 it
 likely
 would
 have
 only
 been


Robin
 Hood
 but
 retail
 has
 vastly


developed
 since
 then
 and
 there's
 a
 lot


more
 retail
 investors
 that
 don't
 use


Robin
 Hood
 but
 still
 you
 know
 choose
 to


speculate
 on
 some
 of
 those
 names.


So,
 it's
 not
 that
 crazy
 to
 me
 to
 imagine


that
 some
 of
 that
 buying
 would
 be


happening
 in
 other
 areas.
 Open
 Door,


speaking
 of
 that
 stock,


uh
 price
 currently
 is


738,
 up
 3%.


As
 we
 get
 into
 the
 open,


dude,
 this
 kind
 of
 sucks.
 It
 messes
 up


the
 whole
 flow
 of
 the
 show.
 I'm
 sorry,


guys.
 This
 is
 just
 one
 of
 those
 market


opens
 where
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 easily
 flow
 with
 everything
 else.
 I


mean,
 we
 kind
 of
 need
 these
 tickers


loading
 instantly
 to
 get
 through
 all
 the


updates
 we
 have.


So,
 it
 might
 just
 be
 one
 of
 those
 days


and
 hopefully
 we
 can
 fix
 it
 by
 the


close.


Um,


I
 also
 I
 probably
 need
 to
 I
 I
 dude
 I


don't
 really
 use
 Trading
 View
 or
 Yahoo


Finance.
 I
 guess
 I
 need
 to
 educate


myself
 on
 those
 platforms
 in
 case
 this


stuff
 happens
 so
 I
 can
 just
 easily
 pull


up
 a
 This
 stuff
 just
 never
 happens.
 Like


we
 never
 have
 an
 issue
 with
 with
 Weeble.


Like
 if
 Hood
 is
 messed
 up,
 I
 go
 to


Weeble.
 If
 We Weeble's
 being
 stupid,
 I


go
 to
 Hood.
 Usually
 they're
 both
 my


backups.
 But
 when
 both
 of
 them
 go
 down,


I'm
 like,
 "Well,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 else


to
 use.
 I
 don't
 really
 use
 anything


else.
 Like,
 I
 don't
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


training
 myself
 on
 how
 to
 use
 other


watch
 list
 platforms.
 I
 just
 pick
 one


and
 use
 it.
 That's
 it."
 And
 yeah,
 Yahoo


Finance
 is
 also
 still
 down
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people.


It's
 just
 weird.


I
 should
 probably
 learn
 Trading
 View,


though.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been
 doing


Technical
 Tuesday
 for
 like
 a
 year
 with


Jason.
 I
 need
 to
 2026
 that
 I
 knew
 I
 know


I
 said
 2025
 one
 of
 my
 goals
 was
 to
 get


better
 at
 TA,
 but
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]


just
 ended
 up
 happening
 in
 2025.
 I
 think


2026,
 one
 of
 my
 goals
 is
 to
 actually
 be


able
 to
 do
 some
 real
 TA
 by
 myself


without
 having
 to
 need
 Jason
 to
 explain


it
 to
 me.
 Bit
 mine
 54.
 Okay.
 Is
 that


because
 ETH
 is
 moving
 up?
 Is
 that


because
 of
 ETH?
 No,
 ETH
 is
 flat.


Bit
 mine's
 moving
 up
 and
 ET
 is
 flat.


Wow.
 You
 We
 haven't
 seen
 that
 happen
 in


a
 couple
 weeks,


but
 Bitmine
 up
 almost
 9%
 and
 Ethereum


not
 really
 doing
 anything.


Trading
 View
 doesn't
 have
 overnight


hours
 data.


Yeah,
 it's
 weird,
 right?
 Like
 people


don't
 love
 the
 charts
 on
 Hood.
 They
 love


the
 charts
 on
 Trading
 View,
 but
 they


love
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 stuff
 on
 Hood
 that


Trading
 View
 doesn't
 have.
 I
 always


thought
 Hood
 should
 buy
 Trading
 View,


but
 Trading
 View
 is
 about
 three
 four


billion
 dollars.
 I
 don't know
 if
 that


would
 be
 the
 best
 use
 of
 their
 capital.


It's
 just
 there's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


people
 love
 about
 Trading
 View
 that
 is


hard
 for
 them
 to
 use
 on
 Hood.


Tom
 Lee
 is
 hacking
 the
 servers
 right


now.
 No,
 but
 you
 dude,
 given
 how


volatile
 Bitmine's
 been,
 it
 hasn't


really
 Right
 now,
 the
 multiple
 is


expanding.
 When
 the
 asset
 is
 doing


nothing,
 aka
 staying
 flat,
 and
 the


treasury
 stock
 is
 going
 up,
 the
 MNAV
 is


expanding.
 Why
 is
 the
 MNAV
 expanding


today?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 they


bought
 more
 Ethereum,
 but
 outside
 of


that
 reason,


I
 don't
 know
 why
 they
 would
 be
 getting


an
 increased
 multiple
 on
 a
 day
 like


this.


A
 could
 you
 do
 a
 TA
 versus
 fundamental


poll?
 Yeah,
 let's
 do
 that.
 Let's
 do
 TA.


Okay,
 so
 the
 question
 is,


um,


if
 you
 had
 to
 pick
 between
 the
 one
 you


use
 more
 often,
 by
 the
 way,
 85%
 of
 you


said
 we'll
 be
 green
 today.
 Uh,
 Joe
 made


a
 good
 point
 in
 the
 chat.
 If
 retail


can't
 buy
 stocks
 today
 and
 we're
 green,


you're
 probably
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


institutional
 buys
 that
 are
 coming
 in,


which
 is
 also
 really
 bullish
 to
 see.
 Do


you
 use
 TA
 or
 fundamentals
 more?


Fundamentals,


TA,
 or
 both?
 Now,
 if
 you
 pick
 both,


click
 both.
 If
 you
 honestly
 use
 both,


like
 5050,
 but
 if
 you
 have
 to
 pick
 which


one
 is
 like
 7030,
 for
 me,
 it's
 like
 9010


fundamentals
 over
 TA.
 Um,
 but
 I
 am


curious
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 the
 breakup
 of


this.


53%
 say
 fundamentals,
 13%
 say
 TA,
 31%


say
 both.
 All right.
 So,
 a
 decent
 mo


majority
 obviously
 fundamentals,
 but


still
 a
 decent
 mix
 across
 the
 board.


Apple's
 still
 up
 2.7,
 Tesla's
 up
 1.9,


and
 then
 pounder


180


on
 the
 day.
 Uh,
 there
 were
 a
 couple


macro
 charts,
 so
 let
 me
 go
 to
 that
 and


then
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 some
 of
 the


legend
 stuff
 and
 see
 if
 it
 comes
 back
 to


normal.
 So,
 I
 shared
 some
 of
 this
 stuff


last
 night.
 Uh,
 first
 of
 all,
 here's
 a


new
 chart.
 US
 debt
 continues
 to
 reach


all-time
 highs,
 98.8


trillion
 in
 Q2
 of
 2025.


It's
 a
 lot
 of
 debt.
 Federal
 government


rose
 to
 35.6
 trillion
 in
 Q2,
 but
 the


most
 recent
 data
 shows
 it
 has
 reached


37.5
 trillion
 or
 123%
 of
 GDP.
 Now,
 Japan


is
 about
 250%
 of
 GDP
 on
 a
 debt
 to
 GDP


ratio.
 The
 United
 States
 is
 at
 130%.


We're
 better
 than
 Japan,
 but
 we're
 not


that
 much
 better
 if
 we
 continue
 on
 this


path.
 So,
 obviously,
 debt
 payments


continue
 to
 stack
 up
 and
 hopefully
 we


can
 grow
 ourselves
 out
 of
 this
 mess.


Leverage
 ETFs,
 701
 of
 them
 exist
 in


October
 of
 2025.
 So,
 we
 have
 massive


leverage
 that
 continues
 to
 enter
 the


system.
 Now,
 the
 overall
 AUM
 of
 these


leverage
 ETFs
 is
 about
 100
 billion.
 So
 I


mean
 even
 if
 these
 ETFs
 were
 to
 go
 to


zero,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that
 wouldn't
 be


the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 for
 the


broader
 market,
 but
 nonetheless,
 there


is
 a
 ton
 of
 leverage
 in
 these
 ETFs
 in


the
 system.
 And
 that
 goes
 to
 the
 second


point,
 which
 is
 that
 there's
 a
 ton
 of


margin
 that
 is
 also
 in
 the
 system.
 If


you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 right


here,
 margin
 debt
 is
 officially
 at
 an


all-time
 high.
 Uh
 1.13
 trillion
 as
 of


September
 2025.
 It's
 up
 67
 billion
 in


one
 month.
 So
 you're
 getting
 margin
 debt


that
 is
 month
 over
 month
 increasing
 by


tens
 and
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars.


Every
 time
 margin
 debt
 got
 to
 these


levels,
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 top
 to
 the


market.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons


why
 we're
 probably
 not
 at
 a
 top
 to
 the


market
 in
 terms
 of
 all
 the
 different


things
 we
 have
 going
 on
 with
 rate
 cuts


and
 earnings
 growth.
 But
 it
 does
 mean


that
 people
 are
 borrowing
 money
 to
 be


able
 to
 go
 long
 assets.
 And
 if
 those


assets
 continue
 to
 go
 higher,
 rates


continue
 to
 go
 lower,
 aka
 the
 cost
 of


borrowing
 that
 capital
 continues
 to


become
 cheaper,
 and
 earnings
 continue
 to


perform
 and
 outperform
 quite
 frankly,


then
 the
 margin
 might
 not
 be
 as
 ugly
 of


an
 issue
 as
 it
 has
 been
 historically.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 the


broader
 market
 performs
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 that
 margin.
 Robin
 Hood


right
 there
 up
 13593,
 pound
 180,
 SoFi


5%.
 I
 think
 I
 was
 just
 about
 to
 say
 I


think
 Legend's
 getting
 faster.
 Then
 I


click
 on
 one
 name
 and
 the
 chart's
 barely


loading.
 So
 never
 mind.
 But
 I
 thought
 it


was
 getting
 faster.
 Google
 right
 there,


that's
 also
 up
 1%


on
 the
 day.
 Wow.
 Fanny
 and
 Freddy,


that's
 up
 8%
 as
 well.
 MongoDB,
 that's
 up


3%.
 You
 I
 mean,
 you
 do
 have
 green
 across


the
 board.
 There's
 not
 that
 many
 names


that
 are
 red.
 Elf
 is
 red
 by
 5%.


Apploven's
 down
 by
 6%.


Coreweave's
 down
 1%.
 Neb
 is
 down
 1%.


Dolingo.
 I
 did
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 Dolingo
 on


the
 Substack.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 for


everyone
 who
 took
 the
 time
 to
 read
 um


the
 Dolingo
 and
 BMR
 article.
 I
 mean,


look,
 after
 doing
 that
 deep
 dive,
 it's


hard
 to
 be
 super
 bearish
 about
 Duolingo.


Like,
 genuinely,
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 is


such
 a
 egregious
 bare
 case
 that
 at
 this


price
 means
 this
 thing
 has
 to
 go
 back


down
 to
 the,
 you
 know,
 to
 the
 150s.
 It's


just
 not
 the
 most
 compelling
 bull
 case


either.
 I
 mean,
 there
 is
 a
 compelling


bull
 case.
 It's
 just
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at


it.
 the
 TAM
 is
 not
 that
 exciting
 to
 be


attracted
 to
 a
 network
 effect
 company


versus
 like
 an
 Uber,
 for
 example,
 that


just
 has
 a
 more
 aggressive
 TAM
 um
 or


even
 a
 Netflix
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 content.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 Dualingo
 eventually
 gets


back
 into
 the
 400s.
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know


if
 they
 can
 get
 rid
 of
 that
 AI
 overhang


narrative
 that's
 on
 top
 of
 them.
 TFC,


that's
 up
 1%
 of
 the
 day.
 IWM,
 small


caps,
 actually
 up
 1.3,
 which
 is
 not
 too


bad.
 Where
 is
 INEN?
 Are
 we
 still
 above


60?
 Wow,
 I
 goes
 below
 60.
 loses
 60


that
 IN
 usually
 leads
 the
 Bitcoin
 miner.


So
 if
 IN's
 taking
 a
 hit,
 you
 might
 start


to
 see
 the
 other
 guys
 go
 red.
 Yeah,
 Bit


Farms,
 it's
 not
 red
 yet,
 but
 it's
 seven


cents
 away
 from
 going
 red.
 Clean
 Spark,


which
 was
 up
 12%,
 now
 up
 10%.


And
 the
 other
 ones
 might
 go
 red
 as
 well.


Cipher
 1980,
 that
 one's
 still
 slightly


green.
 Quantum
 is
 red.
 QBTS,
 are
 we
 red


on
 Quantum?
 We
 are
 down
 2%.


IO
 and
 Q
 down
 1%
 and
 Regetti


2.85%
 down.
 All right,
 so
 the
 quantum


names
 are
 red
 and
 then
 Tesla
 getting


some
 love.
 What
 do
 we
 think
 Tesla?
 Are


we
 making
 a
 move
 on
 Wednesday?
 We'll
 do


more
 of
 a
 preview
 as
 we
 get
 into


earnings.
 We
 talked
 about
 it
 last
 night.


My
 simple
 thoughts
 on
 Tesla
 is
 I
 don't


know
 what
 the
 company's
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 say
 to
 get
 the
 market
 to
 be
 super


excited.
 Like
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if


there's
 enough
 that
 uh
 they
 can
 do
 to


get
 the
 stock
 to
 actually
 make
 all-time


highs.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 even


holding
 the
 430s,
 440s,
 I
 think
 is


important
 for
 it
 to
 bust
 out
 into
 the


500s.
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 just
 I
 think
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 earnings
 growth
 and
 that


stuff
 probably
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 see


until
 2026.
 Energy
 is
 going
 to
 be
 good,


but
 energy
 is
 not
 a
 massive
 contributor


to
 the
 bottom
 line.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 up


1.8%.
 Google


that
 is
 up
 1%
 as
 well.


BTBT
 is
 ripping.
 That
 is
 another
 uh
 ETH


Treasury.
 Wow.
 17%.


Okay.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 some
 action


there.
 That's
 weird.
 Why
 are
 all
 the
 ETH


treasuries
 going
 up,
 but
 ETH
 is
 staying


flat.


You
 might
 have
 someone
 who's
 buying
 a


ton
 of
 these,
 right?
 Maybe
 an


institution
 coming
 in
 and
 establishing


some
 positions.


Or
 maybe
 just
 retail
 can't
 sell.
 And


maybe
 that's
 what's
 happening.


But
 there's
 something
 going
 on.
 Joby
 as


well
 up
 four
 and
 a
 half
 percent.


Um


Doug
 says,
 "Oddow
 that
 previous
 day's


problems
 were
 that
 liquidity
 issues


stopped
 the
 new
 generation
 online


trading
 platforms
 from
 working.
 Now
 that


there
 is
 liquidity,
 retail
 is
 still


locked
 out."
 Yeah,
 it's
 weird,
 dude.


It's
 very
 very
 weird
 how
 it's
 affecting


it.
 But
 also,
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 if
 you


chalk
 it
 up
 to
 AWS,
 then
 some
 of
 these


platforms
 that
 just
 aren't
 using
 AWS


aren't
 affected.
 Yeah,
 ETH
 is
 up
 over


the
 weekend,
 but
 ETH
 is
 not
 up
 that


much.
 Like
 ETH
 is
 up
 enough
 for
 Bitmine


to
 probably
 be
 at
 50,
 50,
 52.
 Maybe


breaking
 out
 to
 almost
 55
 is
 assuming


ETH
 is
 closer
 to
 42
 4,300.
 And
 you
 know,


that's
 not
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 now.


Uh
 Trump
 is
 live.
 Is
 he
 actually
 live?


No.
 No.
 If
 you're
 looking
 at
 the
 feed


where
 he's
 talking
 about
 Air
 Force
 One,


that
 was
 last
 night.
 So
 he's
 not


actually
 live
 right
 now.
 Let's
 get
 some


updates
 from
 China
 and
 hear
 what's
 going


on
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 GDP
 growth


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> And
 also
 the
 slowest
 level
 in
 about
 a


year.
 Um
 just
 shows
 some
 of
 the


pressures
 that
 have
 been
 building
 on
 the


Chinese
 economy.
 Something
 that
 Treasury


Secretary
 Scott
 Basson
 actually
 said
 in


an
 interview
 last
 week
 uh
 as
 to
 some
 of


their
 motivation
 for
 why
 they're
 acting


tougher
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 trade


situation.
 And
 just
 to
 break
 it
 down


further,
 what
 you
 see
 is
 retail
 sales


are
 weak.
 3%
 was
 less
 than
 expected


there.
 The
 consumer's
 been
 sluggish
 in


China.
 What's
 strong?
 Industrial


production.
 Their
 export
 machine
 is


still
 going
 and
 powering
 ahead.
 Up
 6
 and


a
 half%
 on
 the
 year.
 And
 we
 saw
 in


export
 data
 last
 week
 that
 they're


finding
 new
 markets
 outside
 the
 US.


Exports
 are
 plunging
 to
 the
 US,
 but


they're
 booming
 in
 places
 like
 Africa


and
 the
 rest
 of
 Asia
 and
 even
 Europe.


They've
 been
 higher.
 So
 that's
 what's


keeping
 their
 economy.
 But
 the
 but
 the


really
 weak
 number
 was
 actually
 fixed


investment
 for
 China
 um
 which
 saw
 a
 drop


and
 that
 and
 that's
 you
 know
 problematic


for
 the
 world's
 second
 biggest
 economy.


So
 it
 gives
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 sense
 of


what's
 going
 on
 there
 beneath
 the


surface
 as
 we
 wonder
 about
 where
 these


trade
 tensions
 lie
 at
 this
 point.


>> Yeah,
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 with
 Jim


about
 uh
 the
 symbolist
 note
 from
 last


week.


All
 right.
 So,
 China
 GDP
 growth
 not
 the


best
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 consumer.


Overall,
 manufacturing
 is
 starting
 to


get
 a
 bit
 more
 momentum,
 which
 is
 kind


of
 what
 uplifted
 that
 GDP.
 Again,
 a
 lot


of
 that
 manufacturing.
 That's
 because


the
 US
 is
 buying
 all
 their
 stuff,
 which


means
 they
 need
 the
 US
 consumer
 as
 much


as
 we
 need
 their
 labor.
 And
 hopefully


that
 gets
 us
 closer
 to
 a
 deal.
 By
 the


way,
 look
 at
 the
 S&P,
 folks.
 We
 are
 30


cents
 from
 touching
 670.
 I
 know
 it's


been
 a
 weird
 morning
 with
 all
 the


brokerage
 outages,
 but
 if
 we
 touch
 670,


I
 mean,
 we
 are
 pretty
 damn
 close
 at
 that


point
 to
 all-time
 highs.
 Pretty
 damn


close,
 which
 would
 be
 very
 nice
 to
 see


as
 we
 get
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 October.


669
 right
 there


on
 the
 S&P.
 Um,
 yeah,
 grab
 567.
 Grab
 the


shorts
 are
 in
 control
 right
 now.
 I
 mean,


volume
 has
 pretty
 much
 died
 out.
 The


shorts
 continue
 to
 manipulate.
 So
 until


they
 have
 an
 earnings
 which
 really
 gets


the
 shorts
 to
 leave
 the
 stock,
 I
 I
 think


the
 stock's
 probably
 not
 really
 going
 to


make
 a
 move
 or
 they
 make
 an
 announcement


of
 what
 they're
 doing
 with
 their
 cash.


But
 again,
 that
 probably
 happens
 within


the
 earning
 cycle.
 Remember
 Q3,
 the


stock
 was
 at
 350
 last
 year,
 went
 all
 the


way up
 to
 570
 uh
 because
 they
 they


increased
 their
 adjusted
 EBIDA
 uh


forecast.
 I
 think
 they
 do
 the
 exact
 same


this
 Q3.
 I
 don't
 know if
 the
 stock
 runs


up
 to
 like
 750,
 which
 would
 be
 an


equivalent
 move,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 the


shorts
 potentially
 stop
 manipulating
 it,


which
 would
 help.
 Nvidia,
 that's
 back
 to


red.
 Tesla,
 that's
 up
 two.
 S&P


trying
 to
 break
 670,
 but
 not
 fully


getting
 up
 there
 yet.
 Wow,
 Nebius,


why
 is
 Nebas
 getting
 hit?
 They
 had
 a


good
 update
 this
 morning
 about
 a
 new


data
 center
 down
 4%.


I
 mean,
 look,
 you
 can't
 complain
 too


much.
 Nebia
 stock
 year
 to
 date
 is
 still


up
 250%
 but
 it
 was
 at
 137
 last
 week.


Is
 this
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 guys
 to
 all
 my


Nebus
 bulls?
 Is
 it
 is
 this
 a
 buy
 the


dip?
 Is
 this
 is
 this
 like
 a
 nibble?
 Is


this
 like
 a
 10
 share
 nibble
 or
 is
 this


weighted
 out
 because
 it's
 going
 below


100?


What
 do
 we
 think?
 Oracle
 margin.
 Dude,


the
 Oracle
 margin
 news
 is
 nonsense


though.


The
 Oracle
 margin
 stuff
 was
 even


disproved
 last
 week.
 Like
 why
 is
 Oracle


at
 the
 heart
 of
 all
 these
 issues?


Yeah.
 The
 see
 the
 problem
 I'm
 looking
 at


the
 headline
 right
 now
 about
 Oracle


margins.
 The
 other
 issue
 with
 the
 Oracle


margin
 stuff
 is
 a
 lot
 of it's
 not


accounting
 for
 future
 growth.
 A
 lot
 of


it's
 only
 accounting
 for
 the
 things


they've
 already
 set
 up
 in
 those
 data


centers
 which
 are
 margin
 intensive


because
 you
 have
 to
 incur
 a
 lot
 of
 cost


to
 be
 able
 to
 set
 up
 those
 data
 centers


in
 the
 first
 place.


I
 mean,
 literally
 on
 their
 freaking


investor
 day,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 chart


right
 here,
 they
 guided
 for
 30
 to
 40%


non-GAAP
 gross
 margins.


This
 is
 much
 higher
 than
 the
 15%
 that


the
 information
 reported
 two
 weeks
 ago


that
 sent
 Oracle
 down
 like
 10%.


I
 don't
 know.
 That's
 weird.


That's
 weird
 that
 Nebus
 is
 getting
 hit


on
 this.
 Nebas
 10882
 and
 then
 Coreweave,


I
 think,
 is
 also
 getting
 hit
 at
 the
 same


time.
 Uber
 that's


down
 1%


133.
 Corre
 down
 three.


Yes,
 Robin.
 It's
 still
 having
 issues.
 I


still
 can't
 even
 look
 at
 that.
 I
 mean,


it's


it's
 not
 even


won't
 even
 load.


There
 is
 a
 notice
 in
 the
 app
 that
 it's


because
 of
 AWS,
 but
 still.


This
 must
 be
 fascinating
 for
 like
 all


the
 people
 that
 are
 into


uh


data
 science
 engineers,
 people
 that
 work


on
 the
 cloud.
 I
 mean
 like
 that
 that
 like


just
 seeing
 how
 much
 the
 world
 is


affected
 by
 this
 stuff.
 Like
 it
 it
 goes


to
 show
 how
 important
 a
 lot
 of these


services
 are,
 but
 it
 also
 goes
 to
 show


how
 crucial
 it
 is
 to
 understand
 how
 the


internal
 dynamics
 of
 how
 this
 stuff


works


because
 it
 affects
 literally
 everything.


Amazon
 though
 is
 up
 1%
 on
 the
 day.


Amazon
 trying
 to
 crack
 215
 right
 here.


Even
 with
 all
 this
 playing
 out,
 I
 think


it's
 because
 on
 the
 crowd
 strike
 thing,


it
 felt
 like
 just
 negligence,
 like


someone
 was
 really
 stupid
 and
 a
 mistake


was
 made
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 airlines


shut
 down.
 With
 Amazon,
 it
 feels
 like


it's
 I
 mean,
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 exactly


what
 the
 reason
 for
 it
 is,
 but
 it


doesn't
 feel
 like
 someone
 pushed
 the


wrong
 button
 and
 it
 was
 like
 negligence.


It's
 more
 like
 it
 was
 it's
 just
 a


maintenance
 issue.


Yeah,
 we'll
 get
 a
 status
 update
 in
 15


minutes.
 Correct.
 and
 then
 we'll
 see


what
 Amazon
 has
 to
 say.


Um,


Amit,
 in
 the
 event
 that
 the
 market
 was


tanking
 and
 you're
 unable
 to
 access
 your


brokerage,
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 holding


companies
 accountable?


I
 mean,
 look,
 it
 depends,
 right?
 Like,


is
 it
 Robin
 Hood's
 fault?
 Is
 it
 Weeble's


fault?
 Or
 is
 it
 freaking
 Amazon's
 fault?


I
 It
 mean
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 Do
 I


really
 hold
 them?
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 a


tricky
 question.
 If
 the
 market's
 tanking


and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 sell
 and


Amazon
 is
 down,
 therefore
 I
 can't
 sell,


it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 blame
 Robin
 Hood
 on


that.
 Now,
 if
 Robin
 Hood's
 down,
 then


you
 you
 you
 give
 a
 you
 know,
 you're


talking
 about
 class
 action
 lawsuits
 out


the
 wazoo.


But
 if
 it's
 something
 else,
 I
 mean,


again,
 it's
 just
 and
 it's
 not
 like
 Robin


Hood's
 running
 on
 some
 random
 cloud


service
 per
 like
 this
 is
 freaking


Amazon.
 This
 is
 something
 that
 Robin


Hood
 probably
 pays
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 AWS


every
 month
 hoping
 that
 this
 [ __ ]


doesn't
 happen.


Granted,


I
 mean
 it
 I
 look,
 I'm
 not
 a
 cloud


expert,
 but


is
 there
 a
 generator
 in
 this
 [ __ ]
 Like


is
 there
 a
 backup
 or
 something?
 Right?


Like
 when
 the
 power
 goes
 out,
 you
 have
 a


generator.


Can
 do
 we
 have
 a
 separate
 cloud
 that
 we


can
 use
 sometimes
 or
 something?


Feels
 like
 that
 would
 that
 would
 be


helpful
 in
 situations
 like
 this.


Are
 you
 saying
 Amazon
 has
 class
 action


lawsuits
 coming?
 I
 mean,
 it
 depends,


dude.
 It
 depend.
 Crow
 Crowdstrike
 had
 a


ton
 of
 them
 because
 Crowdstrike
 legit


had
 a
 negligence
 problem
 with
 Amazon.
 We


don't
 know
 exa
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 why


this
 is
 happening,
 but
 maybe
 maybe
 there


is
 some
 broader
 concern


with
 how
 this
 ended
 up
 playing
 out
 and


they
 get
 sued.


I
 don't
 think
 a
 VPN
 would
 fix
 this,


guys.
 I
 don't
 think
 if
 I
 get
 on
 a
 VPN


and
 change
 my
 location
 that
 will
 change


anything
 necessarily.


Feels
 like
 it's
 a
 broader
 issue
 that's


going
 on.


Um,


could
 be
 a
 power
 issue.
 Dude,
 if
 it's
 a


data,
 if
 Amazon
 says
 the
 reason
 this


happened
 was
 because
 data
 centers
 were


creating
 too
 much
 load
 on
 the
 cloud
 and


there
 was
 an
 energy
 issue,
 that
 would
 be


wild.
 That
 would
 be
 absolutely
 wild.


I
 mean,
 it
 would
 once
 again
 go
 to
 show


that
 energy
 is
 definitely
 in
 a
 a
 tougher


situation
 than
 not.
 Uh,
 all
 right,
 let's


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 of
 these
 other


tickers
 loading
 up.
 So
 S&P
 still
 trying


to
 make


back
 to
 670
 levels.
 Archers
 up
 2%.


GameStop's
 up
 1%.
 Lockheed's
 up
 one.
 New


banks
 up
 2.21533.


Um


admit
 this
 is
 a
 crowd
 strike
 moment.
 It


is
 a
 crowdstrike
 moment,
 but
 the
 stock


is
 not
 down
 30%
 like
 Crowdstrike.


That
 that's
 the
 problem.
 Like
 we
 can't


really
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 this
 because
 there


is
 no
 dip
 that
 we're
 seeing.
 Salesforce


249,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 And then


Meta,
 wow,
 Meta
 making
 a
 move
 back
 to


730.
 This
 thing
 was
 at
 690
 last
 week.


So,
 nice
 little
 recovery
 there.
 And
 then


SMCI
 was
 up
 7%,
 now
 it's
 up
 5%.
 BMR,
 we


still
 holding
 54.


ETH
 is
 still
 slightly
 down.
 BMR
 53.
 All


right.
 So,
 Bitmine
 going
 down
 as
 well.


Uh,
 Iran
 and
 cipher
 dumping.


Well,
 Cipher
 still
 up
 down
 from
 its


highs.
 Iran
 officially
 goes
 down
 2.4%.


Here's
 the
 other
 thing
 about
 when
 the


market
 potentially
 gets
 back
 to
 all-time


highs.
 And
 I
 I
 would
 love
 to
 know


perspectives
 in
 the
 chat
 right
 here.
 If


the
 market
 goes
 back
 to
 all-time
 highs,


so
 let's
 go
 to
 6
 673.


Um,
 let's
 just
 call
 it
 675.


And
 Oaklo
 goes
 back
 to
 195.
 Do
 you
 think


we're
 in
 a
 healthy
 bull
 market?
 Oaklo


down
 4%.
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 are.
 I


mean,
 like,
 look,
 it's
 still
 a
 bull


market
 that
 Oaklo
 is
 not
 going
 to
 ruin,


but
 I
 think
 if
 Oaklo
 stays
 stuck
 at
 150


and
 the
 S&P
 gets
 to
 675,
 it's
 a
 lot


healthier.
 Aka,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff


that's
 been
 running
 for
 no
 reason,
 if


that
 stuff
 kind
 of
 stays
 in
 the


graveyard,
 metaphorically,
 while
 the


rest
 of
 the
 market
 goes
 back
 up,
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 a
 very,
 very
 healthy
 thing


to
 see
 if
 everything
 just
 goes
 back
 to


going
 bonkers.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 it's


it's
 going
 back
 to
 being
 a
 clownish


market.
 Like,
 you
 don't
 want
 the
 meme


stocks
 running
 like
 crazy
 just
 because


the
 broader
 market
 recovers.
 You
 want
 a


lot
 of those
 stocks
 to
 get
 flushed
 out.


The
 question
 is,
 do
 you
 need
 a
 do
 you


need
 like
 a
 10%
 S&P
 draw
 down
 to
 flush


those
 names
 out
 or
 can
 those
 names
 get


flushed
 out
 independent
 of
 the
 market?


Like,
 if
 Quantum
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 moon


when
 the
 S&P
 gets
 to
 alltime
 highs,
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 the
 healthiest.


So,
 I
 would
 be
 curious
 to
 see
 can
 we


make
 all-time
 highs
 believe
 the
 stuff


that
 was
 stupid
 to
 to
 to
 be
 stupid.
 And


what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 not
 saying
 their


companies
 are
 stupid,
 just
 saying
 the


runs
 they
 were
 having
 made
 no
 sense.


I
 feel
 like
 it'd
 be
 better
 if
 those


names
 don't
 run.
 And
 I
 think
 it'd
 be


better
 for
 all
 of
 us,
 dude.


Especially
 if
 you're
 in
 some
 of
 those


names
 because
 if
 you
 want,
 you
 know,
 a


quantum
 stock
 to
 stay
 up
 4,000%,
 you
 it


you
 probably
 don't
 need
 it
 to
 keep
 going


up
 every
 day.
 you
 probably
 needed
 to


consolidate
 and
 normalize
 in
 a
 range


which
 would
 be
 bullish
 for
 your
 position


because
 you
 get
 to
 keep
 your
 gains.
 But


if
 it
 just
 keeps
 going
 up
 and
 up
 and
 up,


I
 mean
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 just


coiling
 up
 to
 eventually
 collapse,
 which


is
 what
 we've
 seen
 over
 and
 over
 again.


So
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of the


most
 important
 things
 that
 we
 see
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 especially
 if


we
 continue
 to
 get
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the


S&P.
 Reddit,
 that's
 at
 210,
 continuing


to
 go
 green.
 GSI
 Technology
 is
 up
 170%.


What
 is
 this
 thing?
 Design,
 development,


and
 marketing
 of
 memory
 products


primarily
 for
 the
 networking
 and


telecommunication
 markets.


Wide
 area
 network
 infrastructure


equipment.
 This
 is
 a
 $400
 million


company.


They
 must
 have
 had
 a
 headline
 today
 to


get
 this
 thing
 moving.


GSIT.


Um,


GSI
 Technology,
 the
 inventor
 of


associated
 programming
 unit,
 a
 paradigm


shift
 in
 artificial
 intelligence
 and


high
 performance
 compute
 processing,


providing
 true
 comput
 and
 memory


technology,
 announced
 the
 publication
 of


a
 paper
 led
 by
 researchers
 at
 Cornell


University.
 Findings
 confirmed
 that


GSI's
 technology
 architectures
 can
 match


GPU
 level
 performance
 for
 large-scale
 AI


applications
 with
 a
 dramatic
 reduction


in
 energy
 consumption
 due
 to
 high


density
 and
 high
 bandwidth
 memory


associated
 with
 CIM
 architecture.


Maybe
 this
 was
 why
 Nvidia
 was
 down


because
 this
 $400
 million
 company


published
 a
 paper
 saying
 that
 they
 can


match
 GPU
 level
 performance
 with
 less


energy
 consumption
 based
 on
 a
 different


paradigm
 of
 how
 they
 associate
 high


bandwidth
 memory
 with
 their


architecture.


How
 long
 has
 this
 company
 been
 public?


GSIT.


These
 guys
 have
 been
 public
 since
 2007.


Today,
 the
 stock
 is
 up
 170%.


Market
 cap's
 half
 a
 billion.
 And
 they


basically
 said
 they're
 going
 to
 create


something
 better
 than
 a
 traditional
 GPU.


I
 don't
 know
 anything
 about
 this
 stock


or
 this
 company.
 I
 just
 read
 the
 PR
 in


front
 of
 you.


again
 like
 is
 it
 healthy
 to
 say,
 "Hey,


we
 published
 a
 white
 paper


and
 we
 can
 use
 less
 energy
 to
 to
 to
 make


better
 GPUs.
 Therefore,
 the
 stock
 is
 up


100."
 They
 haven't
 sold
 a
 single
 one
 of


these.
 They
 haven't
 landed
 any


contracts.
 There's
 no
 data
 centers.
 It's


a
 white
 paper.


I
 mean,
 come
 on,
 bro.
 This
 stuff
 is
 not


real.
 Like,
 this
 is
 like,
 it
 could
 be


real,
 but
 a
 white
 paper
 increases
 the


market
 cap
 by
 $300
 million.
 Like,
 what


are
 we
 talking
 about?


This
 is
 the
 stuff
 you
 just
 don't
 want
 to


see,
 bro.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 this


[ __ ]
 This
 is
 not
 real.
 Like,
 this
 stuff


ends
 up
 fading.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


healthy
 either.
 So,


we
 got
 to
 see.
 I
 think
 it's
 halted,
 too,


by
 the
 way,
 because
 it's
 not
 really


moving.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 it's
 halted
 on


Weeble.
 Weeble
 still
 is
 horrible,
 dude.


Weeble's
 barely
 moving
 either,
 but
 it


looks
 halted.


If
 Oak
 can
 make
 money,
 so
 can
 GSIT.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 I'm


not
 denying
 the
 validity
 of
 their
 white


paper.
 They're
 there.
 I
 haven't
 read


through
 the
 whole
 thing.
 They
 probably


did
 potentially
 come
 up
 with
 some


amazing
 breakthroughs,
 but
 does
 that


mean
 the
 stock
 needs
 to
 go
 up
 170%
 for
 a


company
 that's
 been
 public
 since
 2007?


Like,
 like
 people
 are
 just
 trusting
 that


Yeah,
 for
 sure
 they
 invented
 a


breakthrough
 on
 GPUs
 and
 just
 buying
 it.


Like


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 weird.


It's
 not
 weird.
 And
 again,
 I
 like
 I


really
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 the
 bull
 market


continue
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 nonsense
 run
 with


it.


unless
 they
 deserve
 it.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


I'm
 talking
 about
 my
 own
 stocks.
 I
 don't


think
 Robin
 Hood
 should
 go
 back
 to
 150


until
 they
 have
 an
 earnings
 that


justifies
 that.
 Robin
 Hood
 being
 at
 150


155
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs
 on


the
 S&P
 500
 would
 also
 be
 a
 joke
 in
 my


opinion.
 As
 much
 as
 I
 love
 Robin
 Hood,


but
 they
 they
 they
 have
 not
 put
 up
 the


growth
 yet
 to
 deserve
 that.
 Now,
 in
 Q3,


if
 they
 put
 up
 the
 growth,
 I
 think
 they


should
 deserve
 that
 and
 a
 premium
 if


they
 can
 really
 continue
 to
 execute.


Whether
 it's
 a
 Robin
 Hood,
 whether
 it's


a
 Nebus
 at
 140,
 whether
 it's
 an
 Oakla
 at


190,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things
 probably


didn't
 deserve
 to
 go
 that
 high.
 And
 I


don't
 want
 them
 to
 just
 get
 back
 to


all-time
 highs
 when
 the
 S&P,
 which
 is


much
 closer
 to
 alltime
 highs
 than
 Robin


Hood
 or
 Nebius
 is,
 gets
 back
 there.


Just
 it's
 it's
 it's
 not
 reasonable
 to


have
 those
 because
 again,
 whatever
 goes


up
 must
 come
 down,
 especially
 if
 it
 goes


up
 as
 violently
 as
 it
 goes
 up.
 And
 I'm


saying
 this
 as
 someone
 who
 has
 a
 lot
 of


hood.
 want
 it,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 hold
 it
 for


a
 long
 time
 without
 dealing
 with
 these


insane
 swings
 for
 no
 reason.
 And
 it
 it


just
 it
 also
 makes
 people
 not
 that


attracted
 to
 the
 name
 if
 it
 goes
 up
 this


much
 and
 goes
 down
 this
 much
 because


then
 there's
 no
 consistency
 at
 actually


holding
 it.


Oaklo
 is
 down
 a
 decent
 chunk
 on
 the
 day,


down
 about
 4%.
 The
 other
 thing
 about


these
 momentum
 stocks
 is
 once
 they
 lose


momentum,
 it's
 hard
 to
 get
 it
 back,


dude.
 It
 really
 is
 hard
 to
 get
 it
 back.


ESTs
 up
 3%.
 I
 mean,
 look
 at
 him,
 dude.


Hims
 has
 basically
 lost
 momentum
 for
 the


past
 couple
 months
 with
 all
 these


lawsuits
 that
 have
 happened.
 Now,
 HIMS


is
 not
 a
 meme
 stock
 or
 anything
 in
 my


opinion.
 I
 think
 HIMS
 is
 a
 phenomenal


company
 that's
 growing,
 but


HIMS
 is
 80
 cents
 away
 from
 going
 back


below
 50.
 So,
 once
 you
 lose
 a
 lot
 of


momentum,
 it's
 and
 you
 have
 narratives


form,
 it's
 really
 tough
 to
 get
 people
 to


come
 back
 in
 and
 then
 the
 shorts
 get


excited
 to
 to
 attack.


Core's
 taking
 a
 hit.
 That's
 down.
 My


Robin
 app
 still
 not
 working.
 Nvidia
 184.


Okay,
 so
 we
 got
 some
 Nvidia
 grain.
 It


was
 at
 181.
 Bit
 of
 a
 breakout.
 GTC
 is


next
 week.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 DC.


Um
 I
 think
 Jose
 might
 go
 there.
 So
 it'


be
 cool
 to
 see
 what
 Jose
 has
 to
 say


there.
 Weeble's
 working
 now.
 Let
 me


check.
 Weeble.


Oh,
 I
 think
 it's
 back.


I
 think
 it's
 back.
 Let's
 see.


Uber.
 Oh,
 yeah,
 it's
 working.
 All right,


there
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 Yep.
 Okay,


Weeble's
 back.
 Hopefully,
 Legend
 comes


back
 soon.
 Robin
 13590.
 All right,
 so
 at


least
 we
 can
 use
 Weeble
 now.
 Bitcoin.


There
 you
 go.
 Loading
 up
 immediately.


A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 lag,
 but
 you've
 got


some
 more
 green
 than
 not.
 Ethereum


4,026,


BMR
 5323.


SA's
 up
 10%.
 Another
 biotech.


We
 talked
 about
 them
 last
 week.
 That's


up
 10.4.


Do
 you
 think
 this
 will
 affect
 Amazon


stock?
 If
 it
 if
 it
 if
 it
 would
 have,
 I


think
 it
 would
 have
 happened
 by
 now.


Again,
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 And
 in
 four


minutes,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 an
 update


from
 Amazon
 on
 their
 blog.
 It
 doesn't


feel
 like


Oh,
 hold
 on.
 We
 got
 an
 update
 like
 five


minutes
 ago.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 uh
 it


doesn't
 feel
 like
 the
 street
 cares
 as


much
 or
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it's
 you


know
 such
 an
 egregious
 error
 like


crowdstrike
 that
 the
 stock
 immediately


tanks.
 Uh
 we
 can
 confirm
 significant
 API


errors
 and
 connect
 connectivity
 issues


across
 multiple
 services
 in
 US
 East1.
 We


are
 investigating
 and
 we'll
 provide
 a


further
 update
 in
 30
 minutes
 or
 soon
 if


we
 have
 additional
 information.


Damn.


Also,
 Amazon's
 not
 Crowdstike.
 You
 know,


Crowdstrike
 was
 a
 what
 hundred
 billion


dollar
 company.
 Amazon's
 2.3
 trillion.


So
 to
 get
 a
 know
 30%
 downturn
 like
 Crowd


Strike,
 it's
 just
 hard
 for
 Amazon
 to
 go


down
 30.
 I
 mean,
 Amazon
 is
 a
 little


bigger
 and
 a
 bit
 more
 important
 for
 it


to
 go
 down
 as
 aggressively.
 S&P,
 are
 we


at
 670?
 Wow.
 670.
 S&P,


she's
 back
 even
 with
 all
 the
 hiccups


today.
 670
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Three
 more
 bucks


and
 we
 are
 back
 to
 all-time
 highs.


Uh,
 and
 the
 good
 thing
 is
 we're
 not


really
 seeing


stupid
 stocks
 run.
 And
 again,
 I
 I
 don't


mean
 stupid
 in
 an
 offensive
 way.
 I
 just


mean


a
 little
 offensive,
 but
 not
 just
 saying


like
 some
 of
 these
 names
 that
 probably


didn't
 deserve
 to
 go
 up
 7,000%
 in
 a


year.
 Oaklo
 is
 down
 5%
 while
 the
 S&P
 is


up
 1%.
 I
 think
 that's
 healthy.


I
 think
 that
 is
 healthy.
 What's
 another


name
 of
 a
 random
 stock?
 SMR.
 Nanuclear.


Yeah,
 Nanuclear
 down
 4%.


SMR
 down
 79%.


What
 are
 what
 are
 some
 other
 names
 that


ran
 up
 for
 no
 reason


that
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 them
 going
 up?


I
 mean,
 all
 all
 the
 quantum
 names
 are


down.


Dude,
 this
 is
 actually
 really
 bullish


because
 if
 freaking
 Quantum
 started


going
 back
 to
 the
 moon
 at
 the
 same
 time


as
 the
 S&P,
 you
 would
 say,
 "Okay,


everyone's
 just
 running
 in
 to
 buy


everything
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 clown
 market


again."
 But
 seeing
 those
 names
 stay
 down


and
 people
 buy
 quality
 like
 the
 S&P,


like
 Nvidia,
 like
 Google,
 that's


bullish.


It's
 leaving
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 behind


and
 hopefully
 that
 money
 is
 not
 really


going
 to
 come
 back
 and
 elevate
 those


companies
 as
 hard
 as
 they
 were
 three


weeks
 ago.
 S&P
 670.3.
 She's
 really


making
 a
 move
 for
 it.
 Big
 Bear
 AI.


Okay,
 that's
 up
 2%
 but
 it's
 down
 from
 10


bucks.
 Look,
 I
 don't
 hate
 Big
 Bear,
 but


has
 anyone
 looked
 at
 their
 earnings?


They're
 growing
 negative
 5%.


Like,
 like
 I
 don't
 understand
 why
 the


stock
 has
 any
 level
 of
 premium.
 There's


no
 growth.
 It's
 an
 AI
 company
 in
 the
 age


of
 AI
 and
 there's
 no
 growth.
 Like,
 what


are
 we
 talking
 about?
 So,
 so
 some
 of


these
 names,
 right,
 like
 they
 just
 it


doesn't
 even
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 even
 trying


to
 be
 super
 bearish.
 It's
 just
 like
 they


probably
 don't
 deserve
 to
 go
 to
 the


moon.
 And
 if
 they
 are
 going
 to
 the
 moon,


it's
 not
 a
 good
 indicator
 of
 a
 healthy


market.


S&P
 right
 there
 670.29.


Fear
 and
 greed
 is
 at
 32.
 That
 is
 also,


yes,
 moving
 up,
 which
 is
 good
 because


we're
 not
 in
 extreme
 fear
 anymore.


So,
 that
 one's
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more


more
 momentum.
 All right,
 they're


talking
 about
 Let's
 get
 some
 coverage


here.


and
 see


some
 more
 about
 what's
 going
 on


>> ago
 that
 there
 are
 significant
 API


errors
 and
 connectivity
 issues
 across


multiple
 servers
 in
 its
 US-
 East1


region.
 We're
 expecting
 an
 update
 on


that
 within
 a
 half
 hour.
 Now,
 this


outage
 first
 hit
 early
 this
 morning,


knocking
 dozens
 of
 companies
 offline


from
 government
 websites
 to
 crypto


platforms
 and
 AI
 tools
 like
 Perplexity.


AWS
 powers
 roughly
 a
 third
 of
 the
 cloud


market.
 And
 the
 issue
 stemmed
 from
 a


failure
 in
 its
 Northern
 Virginia
 data


center
 disrupting
 more
 than
 70
 services.


Now,
 cyber
 experts
 say
 it
 wasn't
 a
 cyber


attack,
 but
 it
 does
 highlight
 how


fragile
 the
 internet's
 backbone
 has


become,
 especially
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI,


where
 services
 like
 Anthropic
 rely
 on


AWS
 to
 run
 their
 large
 language
 models


in
 real
 time.
 Now,
 compared
 to
 last


year's
 Crowd
 Strike
 meltdown,
 which
 was


resolved
 quickly
 but
 left
 companies


dealing
 with
 manual
 recovery
 for
 weeks,


this
 was
 a
 different
 kind
 of
 failure.
 As


one
 expert
 put
 it
 to
 me,
 Crowdstrike


shut
 down
 the
 computers
 themselves
 while


AWS
 shut
 down
 the
 services
 that
 those


computers
 talk
 to.
 You
 AWS's
 US
 East1


region
 has
 been
 a
 recurring
 point
 of


failure
 for
 them.
 It
 is
 the
 cloud's


busiest,
 most
 interconnected
 zone,
 and


when
 something
 breaks
 there,
 the
 ripple


effects
 spread
 fast.
 Morgan
 Stanley


called
 the
 incident
 not
 helpful
 to


already
 fragile
 AWS
 sentiment.
 They


expect
 Amazon
 to
 issue
 credits
 to


customers.
 Investors
 will
 have
 this
 in


mind
 when
 Amazon
 reports
 earnings
 next


week.
 Remember
 AWS
 growth
 has
 been


lagging
 behind
 Azure
 and
 Google
 and


backlog
 now
 trails
 Microsoft
 and
 Oracle.


Guys,


I
 guess
 one
 of the
 questions
 is
 McKenzie


if
 if
 it
 has
 any
 kind
 of
 lasting
 impact


in
 the
 minds
 of
 their
 clients,
 right?


and
 and
 causes
 them
 to
 switch


competitively.
 That's
 what
 we
 were
 all


asking
 during
 the
 crowd
 strike
 outage
 as


well.


>> Well,
 notably,
 OpenAI
 has
 not
 been
 an


AWS
 customer
 anthropic.
 We've
 seen
 them


uh
 diversify
 into
 GCP
 and
 this


multicloud
 strategy
 to
 avoid
 this
 kind


of
 disruption.
 We
 heard
 from
 the


perplexity
 CEO
 this
 morning
 attributing


all
 of
 the
 disruption
 that
 they've
 seen


to
 this
 AWS
 outage.
 And
 it
 is
 a
 huge


concern
 especially
 in
 this
 generative
 AI


era
 where
 they
 have
 where
 these


companies
 are
 hungry
 for
 compute
 and


they
 are
 primarily
 getting
 it
 from
 these


cloud
 providers
 while
 they
 build
 out
 all


this
 infrastructure
 because
 all
 those
 OI


deals
 worth
 $1.5
 trillion
 it's
 not
 built


yet
 and
 it's
 not
 coming
 online
 for
 at


least
 a
 year.


Got
 an
 update
 from
 Amazon.
 We
 have


confirmed
 multiple
 AWS
 services


experienced
 network
 connectivity
 issues


in
 the
 US
 East1
 region.
 We
 are
 seeing


early
 signs
 of
 recovery
 for
 the


connectivity
 issues
 and
 are
 continuing


to
 investigate
 the
 root
 cause.
 Okay.
 So,


they
 don't
 have
 a
 full
 root
 cause


explanation
 yet.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 said
 there
 were
 some
 DNS


issues,
 but
 I
 would
 imagine
 when
 they


fully
 investigate
 in
 probably
 24
 to
 48


hours,
 maybe
 even
 tonight,
 we're
 going


to
 get
 a
 full
 reason
 for
 why
 this


happened.
 And
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 the
 stock


is
 not
 absorbing
 the
 actual
 reason
 for


why
 this
 happened.
 But
 we'll
 find
 out


later.
 Amazon's
 up
 1%
 on
 the
 day,
 215.


S&P
 still
 holding
 670.
 If
 we
 could
 get
 a


670
 close
 today,
 folks,
 the
 bulls
 might


be
 back
 in
 charge,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can


hold
 that
 level.
 Tesla
 right
 there,


that's
 up
 1%.
 Pounder
 up
 2.4.
 And
 then


Hoodie
 still
 holding
 up
 5%
 on
 the
 day.


AMD,
 is
 she
 running?
 AMD,
 wow,
 back
 to


241.
 Is
 that
 alltime
 highs?
 I
 think


that's
 alltime
 highs.


Yeah,
 AMD
 all-time
 highs.
 I
 probably


can't
 check
 resistance.
 Yeah,
 hood's
 not


working
 enough
 for
 me
 to
 check


resistance,
 but
 um
 24151
 today
 was
 the


alltime
 high
 on
 an
 AMD.


Okay,
 not
 too
 bad.


Not
 too
 bad.
 AMD
 was
 a
 big
 one
 this
 year


for
 a
 lot
 of
 retail.
 Crowd
 strikes
 at


496.
 Bob
 is
 up
 a
 bit.


IBKR
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Cisco's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Oaklo
 is
 still
 down,
 it


looks
 like.
 Crowd
 Strike
 again
 496.


Delta's
 up
 2.5.


Rocket
 Lab


69.28.
 Let's
 go
 back
 to
 Weeble,
 see
 if


that's
 working.
 My
 price
 target
 for


Amcor
 is
 45
 to
 50.
 I'm
 assuming
 a


doubling
 in
 uh
 sales.
 So
 from
 like
 6.3


to
 closer
 to
 12.9.


But
 that's
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year.


So
 I
 think
 there's
 about
 20
 25
 bucks
 of


upside
 from
 these
 levels


uh
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Rocket
 Lab
 6915,
 S&P
 still
 holding
 670


and
 then
 Amazon
 215.
 ESTs.


Yeah,
 Weeble's
 still
 being
 slow,
 dude.


Weeble's
 not
 fully
 fixed.
 I
 still
 can't


search
 for
 as


damn.
 So,
 like
 some
 stuff
 is
 coming


back.
 My
 Robin
 Hood
 app's
 not
 working.
 I


can't
 make
 a
 single
 trade.
 So,
 that's


Wait,
 can
 I
 Oh,
 hold
 on.
 Is
 it
 coming


back?


AMD
 just
 loaded
 for
 me?
 No,
 I
 can't.


Well,
 it's
 been
 an
 hour
 since
 the
 market


open.
 I
 mean,
 you
 might
 have
 a
 Robinet


and
 a
 Coinbase
 seriously
 think
 about


moving
 if
 like
 I
 mean,
 they're
 they're


going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 some
 compensation


from
 AWS
 on
 this.
 Imagine
 the
 amount
 of


dollars
 Robin
 Hood's
 losing
 right
 now.


Like
 imagine
 the
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 trades
 that
 are
 not
 happening
 that


could
 be
 happening
 because
 of
 this.


That's
 where
 you
 could
 have
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 bare
 case
 for
 a
 Q4
 guidance.
 Amazon


might
 say,
 you
 know,
 CrowdStrike
 said


this
 as
 well.
 It
 wasn't
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 it
 did
 hurt
 their


growth
 estimates.
 Amazon
 might
 say,


"Look,
 we
 had
 to
 give
 Robinet
 a,
 I
 don't


know,
 $10
 million
 voucher
 of
 AWS
 credits


because
 we
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 for
 them


on
 Monday,
 October
 20th.
 if
 you
 have
 to


do
 the
 same
 for
 Coinbase
 and
 Slack
 and


you
 know
 you
 just


there
 might
 be
 some
 compensation
 that


Amazon
 has
 to
 give
 out
 if
 this
 really


gets
 bad


and
 that
 could
 be
 a
 deeper
 issue.
 Um


Oracle
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Yeah,
 I'm


not
 sure
 why
 Oracle's
 down.
 Didn't
 see
 a


headline
 on
 Oracle.
 It
 did
 rally
 a
 lot


last
 week
 though
 from
 like
 270
 to
 303.


It's
 at
 two.
 Oh,
 wow.
 It's
 down
 a
 lot


today.
 No,
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 I'm
 not
 sure


the
 headline.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 find


something.
 That's
 weird.
 It
 was
 holding


295.


Gold
 is
 still
 up


and
 silver
 is
 still
 up.
 Here
 is
 a
 new


chart
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 thought
 this


was
 pretty
 incredible.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


generative
 AI
 web
 traffic
 across
 the


board.
 Meta,
 hugging
 face,
 Glock,
 Grock,


Claude,
 Perplexity.
 I
 mean
 the
 the


traffic
 share
 has
 increased
 dramatically


for
 all
 these
 services
 over
 the
 past
 12


months
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 more
 and
 more


and
 more
 will
 continue.
 Now
 Gemini


continues
 to
 steal
 a
 lot
 more
 share
 from


OpenAI.
 Uh
 Gemini
 is
 still
 top
 five
 on


the
 app
 store
 but
 Sora
 from
 OpenAI


continues
 to
 be
 number
 one.
 I
 look
 I


look
 I've
 kind
 of
 concluded
 the
 the
 the


video
 apps
 on
 AI


just
 after
 a
 week
 of
 using
 them.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 winner.
 I


mean,
 like,
 I
 think
 they
 will
 get
 some


audience.
 And
 I
 know
 they're
 growing


like
 crazy,
 but
 part
 of
 the
 thing
 that


makes
 social
 media
 fun
 is
 seeing
 your


friends
 on
 social
 media
 and
 people
 you


know
 or
 like
 celebrities,
 right?
 Like


people
 that
 you
 want
 updates
 from.
 This


AI
 stuff
 is
 like
 it
 gets
 bored
 pretty


quickly.
 Like,
 does
 anyone
 else
 feel


like
 that?


And
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 I
 know
 it's


number
 one
 in
 the
 app
 store.
 I
 know
 it's


beating
 Tik
 Tok,
 but
 like
 how
 many


people
 really
 want
 to
 scold
 through
 AI


generated
 content
 enough
 to
 to
 the
 point


where
 it
 beats
 like
 user
 generated


content
 on
 Tik
 Tok?


It
 probably
 is
 too
 early
 for


conclusions,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 just


kind
 of
 felt
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is


missing
 the
 point
 of
 of
 of
 social
 media.


The
 whole
 point
 is
 to
 connect
 more
 than


just
 to
 see
 random
 AI
 generated
 content.


Uh,
 Robin
 Hood
 may
 have
 to
 spend
 on
 a


backup
 if
 their
 main
 server
 is
 down.
 The


backup
 should
 work
 automatically.
 That


means
 paying
 extra.
 Well,
 the
 backup's


definitely
 not
 working
 automatically.
 It


is
 still
 down
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here.


But
 it's
 weird,
 right?
 It's
 like,
 you


know,
 whenever
 Steve
 says,
 "Oh,
 the


bullcase
 for
 Netflix
 with
 AI
 is
 I
 can


tell
 Netflix
 to
 generate
 me
 some
 type
 of


show
 based
 on
 a
 prompt."
 I'm
 like,


"Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 that's
 probably


cool."
 But
 like
 I
 I
 still
 feel
 like


someone's
 creative
 vision
 manifesting
 in


content
 is
 what
 people
 want
 to
 consume


more
 than
 them
 prompting
 their
 own
 type


of
 content.


Not
 saying
 there's
 not
 going to
 be
 a


massive
 market
 for
 prompting
 your
 own


content.
 Just
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


that's
 what
 people
 will
 connect
 with


long
 term.
 You
 know,
 like
 the
 reason
 you


go
 to
 Instagram
 is
 because
 you
 want
 to


see
 your
 friend's
 bachelor
 party.
 you


know,
 AI
 can't
 replicate
 the
 the
 the


memories
 of
 your
 friend's
 bachelor


party,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 I
 don't know.


It's
 just
 it's
 not
 the
 most
 compelling


offering
 to
 me
 from
 OpenAI.
 And
 if


that's
 what
 they're
 spending
 all
 these


data
 centers
 on
 is
 more
 AI
 slop
 videos,


I
 just
 feel
 like
 the
 ROI
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 that
 aggressive.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 so


Nadella
 had
 some
 beef
 over
 the
 weekend


with
 Altman


in
 terms
 of
 what
 he
 said.
 So
 uh
 the


information
 reported
 that
 OpenAI
 could


spend
 more
 on
 servers
 going
 into
 2030


with
 Oracle
 than
 Microsoft
 and
 OpenAI's


growing
 compute
 needs
 uh
 have
 led
 to
 the


end
 of
 its
 exclusivity
 with
 Microsoft


deal.
 Microsoft
 executives
 are
 worried


about
 the
 consequences
 of
 overbuilding


data
 centers.
 So
 basically
 the


information
 got
 some
 quotes
 from


executives
 that
 said
 hey
 we
 think
 that


the
 data
 center
 buildout
 for
 open
 AI
 is


becoming
 too
 aggressive
 and
 as
 a
 result


we
 don't
 want
 to
 finance
 and
 be
 a
 part


of
 the
 amount
 of
 cloud
 compute
 that


OpenAI
 is
 going to
 need
 for
 these
 data


centers
 and
 so
 it's
 okay
 if
 they
 use


other
 parties
 aka
 Nadella
 saying
 hey


maybe


maybe
 a
 divorce
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 idea


here


and
 we're
 still
 going
 to
 keep
 some
 of


our
 assets
 if
 we
 get
 a
 divorce.


which
 is
 probably
 around
 30%
 of
 the


company.
 But
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 really
 be


associated
 with
 these
 guys
 building
 out


as
 much
 as
 they're
 building
 out
 because


we
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 going
 to
 be


that
 much
 usage.
 Now,
 in
 OpenAI's


defense,
 their
 argument
 is
 people
 are


underestimating
 dramatically
 the
 amount


of
 capex
 that's
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be


spent
 and
 you
 know,
 we're
 going to
 need


trillions
 and
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 of


more.
 And
 Nadella
 doesn't
 necessarily


disagree
 with
 that.
 I
 think
 Nadella
 is


just
 not
 sure
 exactly
 the
 route
 that


OpenAI
 is
 going
 to
 make
 that
 happen.


And
 so,
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 might
 see
 that


breakup
 happen
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 that


ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Uh,
 videos
 are
 expensive
 to
 generate.


They
 need
 to
 monetize
 those
 relatively


quickly.
 Yeah,
 that's
 the
 other
 thing.
 I


mean,
 like,
 when
 are
 they
 going to
 start


putting
 ads
 in
 in
 these?
 When
 are
 they


going to
 start
 putting
 ads
 in
 chatbt
 in


general?
 Dude,
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 when


you
 really
 think
 about
 the
 world.


There's
 not
 that
 many
 ways
 to
 make


money.
 It's
 like
 people
 pay
 for


something
 or
 people
 pay
 to
 get
 other


people
 to
 pay
 for
 something.
 Like,
 if


you
 really
 sum
 up
 the
 world,
 those
 are


the
 two
 business
 models.
 people
 pay
 you


for
 something
 or
 they
 pay
 you
 to
 get
 you


to
 make
 other
 people
 pay
 for
 something.


And
 so,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 not
 that
 many


creative
 models
 that
 ChatBT
 is
 going to


go
 after.
 It's
 either
 subscription


revenue
 or
 advertising.
 And
 until


advertising
 ramps
 up,
 you
 know,


subscription
 revenue
 is
 just
 not
 as


juicy
 as
 what
 the
 potential
 of


advertising


could
 be.
 AMD
 right
 there,
 242
 all-time


highs
 on
 AMD.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like
 AMD
 is


getting
 a
 bid
 today.
 Maybe
 with
 a
 lot
 of


the
 Jensen
 talk
 over
 the
 weekend,


Nvidia,
 right?
 They're
 up
 half
 a
 percent


as
 well.
 S&P,
 look
 at
 that.
 670.5.


Maybe
 maybe
 we're
 going
 back
 to
 671.


That
 would
 be
 a
 official.


I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 what
 that
 Let's
 do


the
 math.
 That
 is
 closing
 in
 on
 if
 we


hit
 671.


Yeah,
 that's
 4%.
 That
 would
 be
 4%
 from


the
 bottom
 from
 the
 bottom
 on
 two
 two


Fridays
 ago.
 Even
 Hoodie
 137,


a
 4%
 move
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 would


be
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 going
 into
 earnings


as
 well.
 Navitas
 continues
 to
 move.
 That


one's
 moving
 as
 well.


And
 S&P
 very
 close
 to
 671.
 Nvidia,


that's
 up
 1%.
 Tesla
 up
 1%.
 Then
 AMD,


look
 at
 that.
 AMD
 is
 going
 for
 243.


I
 guess
 all
 the
 semiconductors
 are


moving
 in
 unison
 today.
 I
 don't
 see
 a


major
 headline
 on
 any
 of
 them


outside
 of
 the
 Jensen
 interview
 last


night,
 but
 it's
 enough
 to
 get
 them


moving.


What
 about
 APIs?
 Yeah,
 but
 APIs
 again


like
 it
 it
 the
 the the
 categories
 are
 so


broad
 because
 I
 think
 they
 encompass


everything.
 API
 is
 you're
 paying
 for
 a


product
 or
 service.


Like
 there's
 two
 business
 models.
 You


either
 pay
 for
 a
 product
 or
 service,


whether
 it's
 a
 subscription,
 an
 API,
 and


you're
 you're
 paying
 and
 you're
 getting


a
 service,
 or
 you're
 paying
 to
 get


someone
 to
 know
 about
 your
 service.
 And


there
 is
 a
 god
 knows
 how
 many
 trillion


dollar
 market,


aka
 the
 pay
 for
 attention.
 You
 either


have
 someone's
 attention
 and
 you're


monetizing
 or
 you're
 paying
 for
 their


attention.


And
 so
 like
 Palunteer
 provides
 a


product,
 they
 get
 paid
 for
 it.
 Google


provides
 a
 product
 that
 allows
 other


people
 to
 pay
 them
 to
 get
 people
 to
 know


about
 their
 product,
 aka
 advertising.


And
 it's
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 else


OpenAI
 monetizes.
 Their
 API
 is
 a
 product


that
 people
 will
 pay
 for
 for
 API
 calls.


Their
 subscription
 is
 a
 product
 people


pay
 for
 or
 they're
 going to
 have
 to
 get


advertising
 because
 into
 the
 system
 and,


you
 know,
 really
 start
 showing
 ads
 on


every
 query
 because
 the
 amount
 of


queries
 that
 they
 have
 every
 day
 without


ads,
 one
 could
 argue
 those
 are
 tens
 and


tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 a
 month


they'd
 be
 making
 if
 they
 do
 it


effectively.
 S&P
 really
 getting
 a


breakout
 right
 here.
 670.8.


SoFi
 as
 well
 2817.


671
 would
 be
 really
 really
 dope
 to


actually
 see
 on
 the
 day.


Amid
 at
 what
 point
 do
 we
 start


considering
 these
 runs
 on
 more
 legit


names
 to
 be
 too
 extended?
 What
 growth


rate
 inflection
 would
 you
 consider
 to
 be


a
 signal
 of
 a
 top?
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to


look
 at
 their
 earnings
 projection.
 So


again,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 Nvidia,
 uh
 if


they're
 going
 to
 do
 $1
 of
 EPS
 in
 2027,


this
 thing
 trades
 at
 25
 times
 earnings


or
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it's
 27
 times


earnings.
 So
 if
 they
 trade
 and
 then
 you


have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 is
 27
 times
 too


expensive?


I
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 is
 no.
 Meta,
 if
 you


assume
 their
 earnings
 forecast,
 don't


even
 get
 aggressive
 on
 what
 the
 analysts


have.
 They're
 trading
 at
 25
 times


forward
 earnings.
 Google's,
 I
 think,
 is


at
 24


23
 or
 24.


Now
 obviously
 the
 Teslas
 of
 the
 world


are
 trading
 at
 like
 200
 times.
 Palenters


are
 trading
 at
 200
 like
 those
 are
 super


super
 but
 also
 they're
 growing
 way


faster
 and
 you
 know
 they're
 getting
 a


bit
 more
 of
 a
 premium
 because
 of
 the


potential
 of
 their
 growth.
 But
 in
 terms


of
 a
 top
 signal
 for
 the
 most
 important


names
 in
 the
 market
 like
 in
 Apple,
 like


in
 Nvidia,


I
 mean
 the
 multiples
 don't
 seem
 so


aggressive
 to
 the
 extent
 where
 you
 would


think
 it's
 2021
 and
 Meta
 is
 worth
 a


trillion
 when
 there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell


Meta
 should
 be
 worth
 a
 trillion,


which
 is
 not
 why
 it's
 not
 feeling
 that


crazy.
 Okay.
 Yes,
 let
 me
 correct
 myself.


Tesla
 is
 is
 not
 growing
 at
 all.
 Not
 even


growing
 faster.
 But
 the
 perception
 of


Tesla
 is
 that
 they
 will
 grow
 faster.
 And


again,
 you
 can't
 put
 Tesla
 in
 these


conversations
 because
 Tesla
 is
 a


unicorn.
 It's
 a
 different
 name.
 It's
 a


different
 breed.
 No
 other
 company
 can


get
 away
 with
 what
 Tesla
 gets
 away
 with.


So,
 the
 perception
 of
 their
 ability
 to


10x,
 which
 is
 how
 Elon's
 going
 to
 get


paid
 a
 trillion
 dollars,
 is
 what
 keeps


the
 stock
 elevated.


But
 that's
 not
 a
 signal
 of
 a
 top
 to
 me.


Now,
 Nvidia,
 if
 Nvidia
 was
 trading
 like


$350
 right
 now,
 like
 yeah,
 that
 would
 be


weird
 because
 like
 Nvidia
 has
 not
 put
 up


the
 growth
 and
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of


risk
 associated
 with
 the
 broader
 capex


thesis
 for
 Nvidia
 to
 have
 that
 much
 of
 a


foreign
 multiple.
 But
 again,
 when
 Costco


is
 trading
 at
 50
 times
 and
 Nvidia's


trading
 at
 27
 times,
 it
 it's
 it's
 hard


to
 scream
 like
 that's
 a
 bubble.


That's
 probably
 not
 exactly
 the
 best


definition
 of
 one


falling
 knife.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200


super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you
 being
 here.


Hope
 you
 enjoyed
 Italy,
 Mr.
 Falling


Knife.
 He
 was
 in
 Italy
 for
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 and
 hopefully
 you
 got
 to


spend
 some
 time
 with
 the
 family
 and
 have


a
 good
 vacation.
 Appreciate
 you
 coming


back.
 Google
 right
 here.
 255.
 That
 is


green
 on
 the
 day.
 SoFi.
 Wow,
 dude.


Should
 have
 bought
 SoFi
 last
 night.
 I


said
 I
 was
 going
 to
 buy
 it.
 I
 didn't


know
 we
 would
 be
 this
 green
 this


morning,
 bro.
 I
 thought
 we
 would
 be
 kind


of
 flat
 to
 choppy
 like
 we
 were
 on


Friday.
 Well,
 we
 just
 opened
 up
 green,


which
 means


I
 don't know,
 maybe
 we'll
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of a
 dip
 during
 the
 week.
 But
 if
 we


can
 keep
 this
 going,
 break
 alltime


highs,
 maybe
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 see
 a
 dip.


Wow.
 671.


We
 are
 $2
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs.


And
 there's
 not
 even
 a
 crazy
 headline


this
 morning.


The
 the
 biggest
 headline
 is
 that
 Amazon


is
 messing
 up
 everything.
 Besides
 that,


no
 other
 updates
 by
 Amazon,
 by
 the
 way.


There
 there's
 no
 other
 crazy
 headlines.


The
 China
 stuff
 was
 kind
 of
 yesterday's


news.
 Uh
 the
 Nvidia
 Jensen
 interview
 was


yesterday's
 news.


I
 mean,


we
 looked
 at
 a
 bunch
 of
 macro
 stats,
 but


those
 aren't
 major
 headlines.
 China
 GDP


was
 last
 night.


It
 seems
 like
 it's
 just
 people
 coming


back
 into
 the
 market,


right?
 Or
 maybe
 the
 headline
 is
 no
 one


can
 sell
 because
 Robin
 and
 Weeble
 are


down
 and
 that.
 Like
 that
 would
 be


hilarious
 if
 that's
 the
 reason,
 but
 I
 I


I
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 the
 reason
 we're


getting
 this
 big
 of
 a
 boost
 across
 the


board.
 Look
 at
 Hoodie.
 Even
 with
 all
 the


problems,
 137,
 Tesla's
 up
 one,
 Pounder's


up
 two,
 Rockle
 trying
 to
 close
 in
 on
 70.


Uh


and
 then
 AMD
 pushing
 242
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 October
 19th,
 by
 the
 way,


yesterday
 was
 uh
 Black
 Monday,
 1987.
 S&P


and
 Dow
 were
 down
 20%
 in
 a
 day.
 Could


you
 imagine
 if
 we
 had
 a
 20%
 draw
 down
 in


a
 day
 on
 the
 S&P?
 I
 know
 we
 kind
 of
 had


something
 like
 that
 back
 in
 April.
 It


was
 over
 the
 over
 the
 course
 of
 three


weeks,
 but
 if
 we
 lost
 20%
 in
 a
 day,


bro,
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 imagine
 what


would
 happen.
 We
 lost
 3%
 two
 Fridays


ago.


People,
 you
 know,
 people
 were
 just
 like,


"Well,
 I
 guess
 everything's
 done."
 You


know,
 it's
 like,
 and
 granted,
 everyone


bought
 the
 dip,
 which
 is
 so
 far
 worked


out,
 but
 still,
 it's
 uh
 it
 I
 think
 just


think
 psychologically
 20%
 down
 in
 a
 day


would
 wreck


everybody


institutionally
 and
 retail.
 It
 would
 be


crazy.


that
 would
 get
 bottomed
 up
 so
 quickly,


dude.
 20%
 means
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 probably


going
 to
 50.
 Tesla's
 probably
 going
 to


200.
 Palent
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 60
 70


maybe.
 Grabb's
 going
 to
 like
 5
 cents.


Reddit's
 going
 to
 95.
 I
 mean,
 like
 a
 20%


S&P
 draw
 down.


I'm
 being
 too
 generous.
 Reddit's


probably
 going
 to
 30
 bucks.
 Meta
 is


probably
 going
 to
 freaking
 300


because
 again
 20%
 on
 the
 S&P
 in
 a
 day
 is


usually
 30
 to
 50%
 on
 individual
 stocks


because
 they
 trade
 at
 a
 relative
 premium


and
 beta
 towards
 the
 S&P.


It
 would
 be
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 dip
 opportunity.


It
 would
 be
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 dip
 opportunity


if
 that
 happens.
 It's
 just
 no
 one
 would


have
 money,
 right?
 like
 we'd
 all
 be


freaking
 down
 on
 everything
 unless


unless
 you
 have
 some
 cash
 on
 the


sidelines.
 By
 the
 way,
 speaking
 of


money,
 uh
 Bank
 of
 America's
 survey
 of


institutional
 investors
 show
 that
 their


cash
 is
 at
 an
 all-time
 low,
 3.8%.


So,
 it's
 not
 just
 retail
 that's
 buying


the
 dip.
 It
 is
 not
 just
 retail
 that's


buying
 the
 dip.
 It
 is
 also
 institutional


fund
 managers
 that
 are,
 as
 you
 can
 see


right
 here,
 having
 the
 lowest
 cash
 level


in
 12
 years.


Now
 you
 could
 think
 this
 is
 toppy


because
 there's
 you
 know
 everyone's
 into


the
 markets
 or
 you
 can
 think
 it's
 not


just
 retail
 that's
 piling
 in
 it's


institutions
 which
 is
 less
 toppy
 because


then
 you
 have
 a
 mix
 of
 market


participants
 that
 are
 buying
 these
 dips


and
 this
 was
 as
 of
 last
 week.
 So
 this


was
 after
 the
 3%
 draw
 down
 um
 which
 you


know
 likely
 means
 that
 more
 fund


managers
 ended
 up
 buying
 more


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 SMCI
 is
 up


potentially
 on
 rumors
 of
 an
 XAI
 contract


not
 confirmed,
 but
 that
 is
 the
 reason


why
 SMCI
 was
 up
 7%
 on
 the
 day.
 Look
 at


the
 S&P.
 It's
 not
 stopping.
 67120.


67395


is
 the
 all-time
 high.
 67395
 is
 the


all-time
 high.
 SMCI
 right
 there
 up
 still


6.7%
 on
 the
 day.


100%
 correction
 coming
 in
 2026.
 Now


look,
 history
 is
 on
 your
 side
 if
 you


think
 a
 correction
 is
 coming
 in
 2026


because
 it's
 a
 midterm
 year
 and
 midterms


are
 pretty
 damn
 bad
 for
 the
 market.
 But


there
 was
 a
 ton
 of
 reasons
 to
 get


bearish
 in
 2025
 on
 a
 historical


precedent


and


that
 didn't
 end
 up
 happening.
 So,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 it
 has
 to


happen
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 people
 would


think
 it
 would
 happen,
 but
 2022


S&P
 was
 down.
 2018
 S&P
 was
 down.
 Both
 of


those
 are
 midterm
 years.
 So,
 the
 most


recent
 midterm
 elections
 we've
 seen,


we've
 just
 not
 had
 a
 healthy


move
 higher.
 But
 we
 also
 didn't
 have
 the


AI
 tailwind.
 We
 didn't
 have
 the
 Fed


easing
 in
 22.
 In
 22
 and
 2018,
 the
 Fed


was
 hiking.
 So
 that
 is
 one
 way
 that
 it


makes
 2026
 legitimately
 different
 is
 you


have
 a
 more
 friendlier
 Fed
 and
 then
 you


have
 real
 earnings
 growth
 and
 that
 is
 I


think
 the
 best
 retort
 to
 all
 these


arguments
 about
 well
 if
 you
 look


historically
 yada
 yada
 it's
 like
 well


historically
 the
 earnings
 growth
 has


never
 been
 the
 way
 it's
 been
 and
 in
 2026


if
 that
 continues


then
 maybe
 that
 doesn't
 exactly
 have
 to


happen
 in
 the
 same
 way.


Yeah,
 September
 is
 the
 worst
 month.
 I


mean
 that
 wasn't


that
 wasn't
 true.
 September
 was
 a


phenomenal
 month.
 August
 was
 a


phenomenal
 month.


So,
 it's
 like


it's
 just
 like
 how
 aggressive
 do
 we
 need


to
 have
 2026
 from
 a
 from
 a
 from
 a


structural
 perspective
 either
 on
 the
 the


macro
 side,
 the
 AI
 side,
 the
 capex
 side,


the
 earning
 side,
 like
 what
 needs
 to


break
 to
 make
 the
 system
 to
 break?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it
 needs


to
 be
 because
 every
 time
 we've
 thought


historically
 something
 should
 break,
 we


haven't
 really
 seen
 that
 break
 and
 we've


had
 earnings
 to
 come
 in
 to
 to
 show
 us


that
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 on
 the
 sidelines
 in


this
 market.
 CleanSpark
 still
 up
 10%
 of


the
 day.
 Again,
 CleanSpark
 is
 up
 because


they
 hired
 someone
 to
 officially
 manage


the
 uh
 the
 data
 center
 business.
 Jeffrey


Thomas,
 senior
 vice
 president
 now
 of


data
 centers.
 That's
 why
 CleanSpark


right
 there
 up
 13%
 on
 the
 day.


Uh,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 three
 interest


rate
 cuts
 next
 year.
 So,
 I
 don't
 see


markets
 correcting
 until
 2027.


Yeah.
 And
 dude,
 like
 every
 year
 if
 we
 if


we
 keep
 saying,
 "All
 right,
 the


correction's
 coming.
 The
 correction's


coming."
 It's
 the
 most
 anticipated


correction
 of
 all
 time,
 which
 is
 good


because
 there's
 so
 many
 people
 expecting


it
 and
 we
 know
 what
 the
 markets
 love
 to


do,
 right?
 They
 they
 don't
 like
 to
 go


with
 consensus.
 And
 so,


it
 might
 not
 be
 that
 easy
 to
 call
 the


top
 here
 if
 every
 single
 person
 is


trying
 to
 call
 the
 top.
 I
 mean,
 in
 2021,


again,
 how
 many
 people
 were
 legit


calling
 the
 top
 in
 2021?


Like,
 yeah,
 I
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 wasn't
 live


streaming
 every
 single
 day
 and
 keeping


up
 that
 much
 with
 sentiment
 around
 the


broader
 markets,
 but
 like
 in
 2021
 when


Bitcoin
 was
 at
 69,000,
 it
 felt
 like
 it


was
 going
 to
 100,000.


I
 personally
 felt
 the
 whole
 NFT
 stuff


was
 kind
 of
 stupid
 and
 the
 web
 3
 promise


of
 technology.
 I
 I
 felt
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 it


was
 dumb,
 but
 I
 wasn't
 out
 here.
 I
 was
 I


was
 buying
 pounder
 at
 27
 watching
 it
 go


down
 to
 $6
 the
 next
 year.
 So
 I


definitely
 was
 not
 the
 person
 who
 called


the
 top.
 But
 like
 who
 legitimately
 said


yep
 like
 there
 weren't
 a
 lot
 of
 people


calling
 it
 and
 that's
 why
 it
 happened


because
 like
 almost
 no
 one
 was
 saying


it.
 I
 mean
 what
 what
 what
 famous
 fund


manager


said
 2021
 is
 a
 top.


You
 know
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 called


the
 2000
 top
 including
 Howard
 Marx.
 Like


which
 famous
 which
 was
 it
 Bill
 Aman?
 Was


it
 Buffett?
 who
 actually
 said,
 "Yep,
 we


are
 in
 a
 bubble.
 It's
 a
 top."
 Who
 was


pounding
 the
 table?
 I
 can't
 even


remember
 a
 single
 big
 name.
 It


definitely
 wasn't
 Kathy
 Wood.


So,
 if
 it
 was
 no
 one
 back
 then
 and


that's
 why
 it
 came
 up
 behind
 us
 and
 now


it's
 everyone
 this
 time,


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 different.


Feel
 like
 it
 has
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


different
 than
 before.


Now,
 Tom
 Lee
 got
 bullish
 in
 2020.
 He


even
 admitted
 it
 was
 a
 mistake.
 I
 mean,


he
 did
 a
 interview
 a
 while
 ago.
 I
 think


we
 watched
 the
 clip
 where
 Tom
 Lee
 was


like,
 "Yeah,
 Tom
 Lee
 said
 my
 Mark


Newton,
 their
 technical
 guy,
 basically


told
 him
 to
 start
 getting
 bearish
 and
 he


ignored
 it."
 And
 he
 said
 he
 said,
 "Next


time
 I'm
 going
 to
 need
 Mark
 Newton
 to


like
 really
 tell
 me
 to
 pay
 attention


because,
 you
 know,
 he
 ended
 up
 not


realizing
 how
 bearish
 it
 could
 become."


And
 then
 they
 ended
 up
 missing
 the
 uh


the
 downturn.


So
 even
 even
 Tom
 Lee
 did
 you
 know
 that


did
 not
 there
 weren't
 there
 weren't


really
 that
 many
 prominent
 figures
 that


were
 like
 yep
 it's
 a
 bubble
 but
 it
 ended


up
 being
 a
 bubble
 sofi
 2847%


it
 looks
 like
 she's
 going
 for
 freaking


freaking
 30


looks
 like
 she's
 going
 430


Um,


Michael
 Bur,
 well,
 no,
 Michael
 Bur
 said


to
 sell
 in
 January
 of
 2023.
 You
 guys


remember
 that
 famous
 tweet
 by
 Bur?
 Bur


sell
 tweet.
 He
 deleted
 it,
 but
 this
 was


the
 tweet.


7:00
 January
 31st,
 2023.
 This
 was
 when


Tesla
 was
 still
 at
 103.
 Palantry
 was
 a


seven.
 was
 like
 we
 bottomed
 in
 December


22
 or
 October
 22,
 but
 January
 23
 was
 not


pretty.
 It
 was
 only
 until
 around
 March,


April
 that
 things
 started
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 more
 exciting
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


a
 potential.
 That's
 when
 Chachy
 BT


started
 making
 more
 sense.
 That's
 when


Nvidia
 had
 that
 quarter
 in
 May
 that
 like


blew
 everyone
 out
 of
 the
 water.


So,
 there
 weren't
 that
 many
 people
 that


really
 saw
 the
 damage
 that
 could
 be


happening
 back
 in
 21.
 NVTS.
 Uh,
 I
 don't


know
 why
 this
 one
 keeps
 moving.
 I
 mean,


at
 this
 point,
 is
 anyone
 getting
 a
 bit


concerned
 that
 it's
 just
 moving
 for
 the


hell
 of
 moving,
 or
 is
 there
 something


legit


for
 why
 it's
 moving?


But
 it
 continues
 to
 move.
 Na'vias
 20%
 on


the
 day.
 Does
 anyone
 think
 that's


justified?
 Is
 that
 a
 real
 move
 or
 is


that
 just
 hype


or
 is
 that
 legit?


I
 mean,
 they
 announced
 an
 Nvidia
 deal


last
 week.
 It's
 up
 400%
 this
 year.
 It's


up
 145%
 in
 the
 past
 month.


I
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 Avita,


so
 I
 can't
 say,
 but
 I
 I
 do
 know
 the


Nvidia
 partnership
 was
 legit
 last
 week.


Bit
 of
 a
 squeeze.
 Yeah,
 honestly,
 that's


probably
 it.
 28%
 short
 float.
 That's


probably
 what's
 taking
 place
 right
 here.


But
 Navas
 is,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 only


names
 that's
 squeezing
 like
 that.
 I


mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 other
 names,
 maybe


Rocket
 Lab,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 squeeze.


It
 still
 has
 10%
 short
 float
 7164.


SoFi
 still
 8%
 short.
 I
 mean,
 not
 enough


for
 a
 massive
 squeeze,
 but
 potentially
 a


little
 bit.
 S&P
 still
 holding
 671.


Um,


and
 that
 other
 stock
 we
 looked
 at,


GSIT,
 it's
 up
 182%
 on
 the
 day


based
 on
 this
 white
 paper
 that
 they
 put


out.


Na'vias
 is
 more
 of
 an
 energy
 story.


Maybe
 it's
 worth
 a
 deep
 dive,
 dude.
 I
 do


not
 know
 too
 much
 about
 Na'vi.
 Maybe
 it


is
 worth
 a
 deep
 dive.
 $3
 billion


company,
 so
 it's
 a
 very
 small
 company.


We'll
 put
 it
 on
 the
 list.
 Maybe
 there's


something
 deeper
 we
 have
 to
 look
 at.
 I'm


just
 looking
 at
 the
 velocity
 of
 the
 move


and
 wondering
 like,
 is
 it
 actually


justified
 or
 is
 there
 a
 lot
 of
 people


piling
 in
 at
 this
 point?


ARCG
 is
 up
 8%
 today.
 Wow,
 dude.
 You
 got


a
 lot
 of
 Dude,
 today
 feels
 like
 an


everything
 rally.
 Look
 at
 that.
 RCG
 up


8%.


Now,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 This
 is
 why
 I


think
 today
 is
 pretty
 bullish.
 Oaklow
 is


down
 3%.


Like,
 you
 really
 really
 want
 to
 see
 the


markets
 get
 back
 to
 normal
 and
 not
 have


a
 lot
 of
 the
 froth
 run
 with
 it.


And
 if
 that
 Open
 Door,
 look,
 Open
 Door


is
 up
 3%,
 but
 Open
 Door
 is
 not
 making


all-time
 highs.
 It's
 it's
 it
 it's
 been


months
 since
 it
 was
 at
 that
 1087
 level.


So,
 you
 know,
 if
 Open
 Door
 was
 blasting


to
 $12
 today,
 that
 probably
 wouldn't
 be


the
 healthiest,
 but
 it's
 not.
 And
 if


you're
 an
 open
 door
 bull,
 I
 think
 it's


healthy
 for
 it
 to
 normalize
 around


seven,
 not
 lose
 seven,
 but
 also
 not


blast
 up
 to
 nine
 for
 no
 reason
 until


they
 put
 up
 earnings,


which
 look,
 I
 don't
 know
 as
 much
 about


Open
 Door's
 new
 changes,
 but
 I
 don't


know
 if
 their
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 be


amazing
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


you
 know,
 they
 still
 have
 to
 make
 money


on
 selling
 houses.
 But
 if
 they
 do
 a


earnings
 call
 that's
 a
 bit
 more


innovative,
 you
 know,
 gets
 retail


excited,
 gets
 the
 street
 to
 see
 their


vision,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 Cass
 can


communicate
 a
 new
 future
 for
 the


company,
 maybe
 they
 do
 a
 video
 call
 and,


you
 know,
 really
 turn
 it
 into
 an
 event.


That
 could
 be
 something
 that
 gets
 people


more
 excited
 about
 Open
 Door.


Uh,
 Venmo's
 not
 working.


I
 mean,
 PayPal
 probably


works
 with
 AWS,
 which
 could
 be
 affecting


Venmo.
 Ire's
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day
 at
 58
 to


62.


Fermy
 is
 also
 down.


Hood
 making
 new
 highs
 of
 day.
 S&P
 still


moving
 670120


along
 with
 SoFi.


Legend
 still
 being
 pretty
 slow,
 but
 we


are
 seeing
 these


continue
 to
 make
 a
 move.


Apple's
 old
 is
 Apple
 alltime
 highs
 right


now.


Holy
 crap.
 Apple
 just
 hit
 alltime
 highs.


Wow.


26157.


Look
 at
 that.


Shout
 out
 to
 Apple.
 Alltime
 highs.
 That


is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 And
 it's
 justified.


It's
 not
 just
 Apple's
 going
 up
 for
 the


hell
 of
 it.
 The
 iPhone
 17
 reports
 look


pretty
 damn
 bullish
 on
 this
 upgrade


cycle.
 And
 so
 you
 could
 argue
 it's
 a


justified
 move
 that
 you're
 seeing
 on


Apple.


Like
 I'm
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 healthy
 things


right
 here.
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 Oaklo
 go
 to


the
 moon.
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 quantum
 go
 to


the
 moon.
 I'm
 seeing
 the
 S&P
 recover.


I'm
 seeing
 Apple
 hit
 alltime
 highs.


Apple
 is
 a
 company
 that
 should
 be


hitting
 all-time
 highs
 over
 a
 lot
 of


other
 companies
 because
 it's
 freaking


Apple


and
 they
 can
 buy
 back
 a
 100red
 billion


of
 their
 stock
 and
 they
 do
 freaking
 90


billion
 of
 revenue
 every
 quarter.
 Like,


you
 know,
 you're
 just
 seeing
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 the
 fundamentals
 come
 into


the
 picture.


And
 then
 you're
 seeing
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD


continue
 to
 make
 a
 move
 as
 well.
 And


Apple
 helps
 the
 S&P,
 right?
 Apple
 is


about
 um


6.3%
 of
 the
 S&P.


So,
 not
 too
 bad.


Not
 too
 bad.
 Can
 you
 sell
 anything?
 Let


me
 see.
 Can
 I
 load
 it
 on
 my
 phone?


No,
 dude.
 It's
 still
 not
 loading.


Dude,
 it's
 been
 two
 hours.
 This
 is


pretty
 bad.
 This
 is
 pretty
 bad
 for
 Hood.


And
 I
 know
 it's
 not
 their
 fault,
 but


it's
 still
 pretty
 bad.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


to
 open
 up
 Coinbase.
 No,
 my
 Coinbase


isn't
 working
 either.
 It's
 not
 even


loading.
 It
 literally
 won't
 even
 take
 me


to
 the
 login
 page.
 It's
 just
 stuck.


Wow,
 dude.
 And
 obviously
 Weeble's
 not


working.


Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 pretty
 incredible
 to


see
 that
 type
 of
 a
 hit.
 Palenter
 right


there, they're
 up
 2.4
 and
 then
 Robin


Hood
 still
 up
 5.9.
 So,
 big
 winner
 of
 the


day
 along
 with
 AMD
 241.
 And
 then
 if
 we


can
 get
 a
 270
 close
 on
 the
 S&P,
 I
 think


that'd
 be
 bullish.


I
 think
 that'd
 be
 super
 bullish.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 A
 couple
 of
 you
 guys


are
 saying
 hood
 is
 going
 good.
 I
 guess


you
 know,
 mine's
 not
 working,
 but
 I


guess
 for
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 it
 is


working.
 Oscar,
 that
 one's
 moving
 up.


Where's
 UNH?


UNH
 is
 361.
 That's
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Oscar
 is
 green
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 In
 terms


of
 the
 heat
 map,
 I
 should
 see
 pretty


much
 all
 green.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 this.


Oracle
 and
 Apploving.
 That's
 it.
 That
 is


all
 you've
 got.
 And
 a
 little
 bit
 of


T-Mobile.
 Well,
 you
 got
 some
 Walmart
 and


and
 Coca-Cola
 and
 Pepsi,
 but
 outside
 of


that,


everything's
 green.


Everything
 is
 green.


Yeah.
 Look,
 if
 you're
 on
 Schwab,
 IBKR,


Fidelity,
 or
 E
 Trade,
 you've
 had
 a
 good


day.
 You've
 had
 no
 issues.
 But
 if
 you're


on
 Hood,
 Weeble,
 or
 Coinbase,
 you've
 you


got
 hit.
 We
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 a
 cyber


attack.
 I
 mean,
 Amazon
 didn't
 really


disclose
 anything
 yet.


Probably
 later
 tonight,
 we'll
 get
 a


better
 update.
 Still
 no
 update
 on
 their


website
 on
 exactly
 what's
 the
 root


cause,
 but
 we'll
 find
 out
 later
 today.


All
 right,
 folks.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 it


for
 the
 day.
 Hopefully
 during
 the
 market


close,
 it'll
 get
 a
 lot
 better.
 I
 think


story
 of
 the
 day
 is
 Apple
 all-time


highs,
 AMD
 all-time
 highs,
 Nvidia
 trying


to
 break
 out
 back
 to
 the
 185
 and
 then


the
 S&P
 recovering
 while
 the
 random


frothy
 stocks
 are
 not
 moving
 at
 the
 same


velocity
 as
 high
 quality
 companies
 and


the
 China
 stuff
 is
 deescalating
 pretty


significantly
 from
 last
 night.
 I
 think


that's
 bullish.
 I
 think
 it's
 really


freaking
 bullish
 knowing
 that
 in
 nine


days
 we
 get
 a
 rate
 cut.


So
 you
 got
 Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 this
 week.


You
 got
 a
 rate
 cut
 next
 week.
 You
 got


Trump
 and
 Xi
 next
 week,
 potentially


Trump
 and
 Kim
 Jong-un.
 Um,
 and
 then
 you


have


the
 broader
 AI
 capex
 tailwind
 that


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 slowing
 down
 based
 on


all
 the
 earnings
 we've
 seen.
 And


hopefully
 in
 the
 next
 coming
 days,
 we're


going
 to
 see
 those
 earnings
 continue


along
 with
 the
 market
 recovering
 without


a
 lot
 of the
 frothy
 names
 going
 up
 with


it.
 I
 mean,
 that
 to
 me
 is
 a
 pretty


decent
 story
 going
 into
 earnings.


Pretty
 decent
 story
 going
 to
 earnings.


Then
 potentially,
 yeah,
 based
 on
 what


Kevin
 Hass
 has
 said,
 maybe
 the


government
 reopening
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


week
 as
 well,


which
 would
 be
 bullish.


Yeah,
 I'll
 be
 back
 for
 the
 market
 close.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 going
 to
 after
 the
 market


close,
 uh,
 I'll
 be
 going
 back
 home
 to
 my


parents
 and
 uh,
 celebrating
 Dali
 with


them.
 But
 I'll
 be
 back
 for
 the
 close.


I'm
 actually
 going
 to
 see
 Steve
 right


now.
 We're
 gonna
 get
 some
 lunch
 in
 New


York.
 So,


I
 will
 be
 seeing
 him
 there.
 And
 yeah,
 we


should
 be
 back
 on
 the
 market
 close
 and


keep
 this
 going
 as
 usual.
 But
 no
 other


crazy
 headlines
 today
 outside
 of
 it


seems
 like
 just
 the
 broader
 market


starting
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 the


earnings
 excitement
 and
 that
 seems
 to
 be


coming
 back.


I
 will
 send
 your
 regards
 to
 the
 milkman.


I
 will
 send
 your
 regards
 to
 the
 milkman.


It
 should
 take
 me
 like
 25
 minutes
 to
 get


to
 New
 York.
 I'm
 I'm
 pretty
 close.
 So,


it
 shouldn't
 take
 me
 too
 long
 to
 get


there.


All right,
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 What
 do
 we


got?
 Word
 of
 the
 day.


It's
 a
 long
 ass
 word.
 Um,


contemporaneous.


Contemporaneous.
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 heard


this
 word
 before.


>> Contemporaneous.


>> Okay,


there
 you
 go.
 This
 is
 what
 happens
 when


you
 don't
 give
 me
 French
 words.
 I
 can


actually
 speak
 them.
 originating,


existing
 or
 occurring
 at
 the
 same
 time.


Okay,
 cool.
 Originating,
 existing
 or


occurring
 at
 the
 same
 time.


I
 guess
 cor
 contemporaneously,
 Hood,


Weeble,
 and
 Coinbase
 all
 got
 shut
 down


due
 to
 what
 happened
 this
 morning
 with


Mr.
 AWS.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.


That's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 the
 day.
 All


right,
 folks.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 me.
 I'll
 be


back
 on
 the
 close.
 Thank
 you
 again
 for


joining.
 I'm
 sorry
 the
 flow
 of
 the
 show


was
 not
 as
 strong
 as
 it
 could
 have
 been.


Hopefully
 this
 stuff
 gets
 fixed
 by
 the


close
 and
 by
 tomorrow.
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


it
 should
 get
 fixed
 at
 least
 by
 market


close,
 if
 not
 by
 market
 open
 tomorrow.


And
 uh
 we
 should
 be
 we
 should
 be
 in
 a


good
 situation.
 Three
 updates.
 I
 said


this
 last
 night.
 I'll
 just
 say
 uh


reiterate
 them
 here
 and
 then
 we'll
 be


done
 for
 the
 day.
 Uh
 Cactus
 Jack
 again,


he
 has
 officially
 joined
 the
 stream
 uh


full-time
 or
 joined
 AK
 Media
 full-time.


So,
 if
 you
 guys
 see
 him
 in
 the
 chat,
 he


will
 be
 helping
 me
 with
 the
 show
 topics,


prepping
 all
 this
 stuff
 and
 uh
 you
 know,


he's
 been
 in
 the
 chat
 for
 the
 past
 year.


So,
 really
 happy
 to
 have
 him
 full-time


and
 it'll
 hopefully
 just
 make
 me
 a
 lot


more
 efficient
 at
 getting
 breaking
 news


and
 hopefully
 help
 everyone
 else
 who


needs
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 breaking
 news
 to
 get


through
 the
 day.
 So,
 we
 got
 Cactus
 on


the
 team.
 Number
 two,
 I
 said
 this
 last


night,
 the
 meetups
 are
 coming
 back
 in


2026.
 I
 had
 a
 really
 good
 meeting
 with
 a


management
 agency
 on
 uh
 Saturday
 and
 uh


we
 have
 not
 officially
 signed
 a
 deal,


but
 essentially
 I'm
 looking
 for
 an


organization
 that
 can
 really
 help
 me


with
 planning,
 security,
 logistics,


infrastructure,
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 it


takes
 to
 travel
 across
 the
 world
 and


throw
 these
 events.
 And
 uh
 I
 think
 I
 I


think
 I
 found
 the
 people
 I'm
 looking


for.
 So
 I
 will
 let
 you
 guys
 know
 updates


on
 if
 that
 gets
 done
 probably
 end
 of


November.
 But
 I
 have
 a
 pretty
 good


feeling
 about
 it.
 And
 uh
 the
 person
 who


set
 this
 up
 is
 someone
 that
 I
 met
 in


Miami
 who
 has
 40
 years
 of
 event
 planning


experiences.
 He
 owns
 multiple


nightclubs.
 So
 it's
 it's
 a
 really
 good


mix
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 type
 of
 people
 I'm


looking
 for.
 And
 the
 meetup
 should
 be


coming
 back
 next
 year.
 And
 I
 think
 it'll


be
 really
 exciting
 because
 the
 meetups


have
 been
 pretty
 successful
 in
 2025
 and


I
 think
 we
 can
 take
 them
 to
 the
 next


level
 next
 year.
 And
 then
 um
 yeah,
 the


final
 update
 is
 just
 the
 Substack.
 I


really
 appreciate
 people
 subscribing
 to


it.
 Really
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 me.
 I
 am


falling
 in
 love
 with
 writing.
 I
 never


thought
 I
 would
 say
 that,
 but
 for
 some


reason
 I
 I
 really
 enjoy
 the
 process
 of


writing.
 It's
 just
 like
 it's
 kind
 of a


new
 challenge
 for
 me.
 I
 think
 I
 think


I've
 been
 talking
 for
 so
 many
 years
 that


I
 was
 looking
 for
 a
 new
 way
 to
 express


myself
 and
 I
 guess
 the
 written
 word,


which
 I
 genuinely
 never
 thought
 I
 would


become
 a
 writer.
 It's
 it
 it's
 fascinated


me.
 Absolutely
 fascinated
 me.
 And
 so,


yeah,
 we
 have
 about
 12,000
 people
 that


subscribed
 on
 Substack
 really
 means
 a


lot.
 Dualingo
 BMR
 for
 the
 first
 two
 deep


dives.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 more


content
 that
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 put
 on
 this


platform
 outside
 of
 just
 deep
 diving


into
 companies.
 Like
 when
 Robin
 Hood
 has


their
 earnings
 and
 I
 want
 to
 write
 up


all
 my
 thoughts
 on
 those
 earnings,


that'll
 be
 a
 deep
 dive
 into
 Robin
 Hood's


earnings.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


content
 that
 hopefully
 people
 will
 be


able
 to
 enjoy.
 And
 uh
 for
 those
 that


really
 like
 reading
 research,
 this
 is
 uh


this
 is
 the
 new
 one
 we're
 going
 to
 be


doing.
 So,
 you
 guys
 can
 subscribe
 there.


It
 is
 free.
 No
 payw
 wall.
 There
 won't


never
 be
 a
 payw
 wall.
 And
 uh
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 I
 already
 started


working
 on
 the
 next
 two
 deep
 dives.
 I


already
 started
 working
 on
 it.
 Literally


Saturday
 I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 time
 to


work
 on
 the
 next
 one."
 Like,
 it's


actually
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 I'm
 getting


into
 my
 writer
 era.
 Maybe
 I
 become
 an


author,
 bro.
 Maybe
 I
 write
 a
 book.


Maybe
 I
 need
 to
 write
 a
 book
 on
 how
 to


be
 funny.
 Maybe
 that
 would,
 you
 know,


maybe
 that's
 maybe
 that's
 where
 this


takes
 me.
 Who
 knows?
 We're
 gonna
 see.


We're
 gonna
 see
 what
 happens.
 But,
 um,


no,
 I
 really
 do
 like
 writing
 and
 we're


going
 to
 keep
 doing
 it
 over
 the
 coming


years
 and
 see
 it
 see
 it
 go
 from
 there.


Romance,
 that's
 what
 I
 need
 to
 do.
 I


need
 to
 write
 a
 book
 on
 love.
 That's


what
 I
 need
 to
 do.
 That's
 that's
 that's


what
 we
 got
 to
 do.
 All right,
 that's
 it


for
 me.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 I'll
 see


you
 back
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Hopefully


this
 stuff
 is
 fixed
 with
 uh
 Robin
 Hood


and
 Weeble
 and
 AWS
 Australian
 PM
 meeting


Trump
 in
 about
 30
 minutes.
 We'll
 get


some
 updates
 on
 how
 that
 goes
 and
 we'll


see
 if
 we
 can
 close
 above
 670
 on
 the
 S&P


500
 again.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the


market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
