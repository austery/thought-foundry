Bloomberg
 Audio
 Studios,
 podcasts,


radio,
 news,


and
 we
 kick
 things
 off
 with
 Brian
 Shim,


CEO
 of
 Anderil
 as
 the
 first
 of
 many


conversations.
 Brian,
 we're
 grateful
 to


be
 here
 at
 Anderil.
 There
 has
 been
 um
 a


lot
 of
 hype
 around
 the
 company,
 a
 deep


focus
 on
 what
 it
 is
 doing,
 how
 it
 is


growing
 and
 so
 as
 a
 place
 to
 start,


would
 you
 just
 bring
 us
 up
 to
 speed
 on


where
 Andrew
 is
 today
 operationally,


revenue,
 the
 business
 it
 is
 doing
 with


the
 US
 government
 and
 Western
 allies?


Absolutely.
 Well,
 thank
 you
 for
 having


me
 on.
 Uh
 really
 excited
 to
 have
 you


here.
 The
 um
 Ander
 has
 been
 around
 about


8
 years,
 but
 we've
 grown
 incredibly
 in


that
 time.
 I
 think
 this
 year
 we're
 going


to
 be
 over
 6,500
 employees.
 We've
 got


something
 like
 about
 half
 of
 them
 here


in
 Costa
 Mesa.
 Um
 we're
 looking
 to


basically
 double
 revenue
 this
 year.
 So


we're
 about
 a
 billion
 last
 year,
 we'll


go
 over
 two
 billion
 this
 year.
 Uh
 and


we're
 ramping
 production
 about
 400%.
 So


a
 lot
 of
 the
 mix
 is
 switching
 from
 a
 lot


of
 the
 earlier
 stage
 things
 we
 were


doing
 which
 were
 you
 know
 kind
 of


experimental
 really
 learning
 what
 the


technology
 could
 do,
 how
 to
 integrate
 it


with
 war
 fighters.
 Uh
 this
 year
 we're


really
 moving
 into
 this
 mode
 of
 really


producing.
 Brian
 forgive
 me.
 We've


actually
 got
 some
 breaking
 news
 that's


just
 crossed
 the
 Bloomberg
 terminal.


President
 Trump
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 was


due
 to
 meet
 China's
 President
 Xi
 in
 two


weeks
 time.
 He's
 saying
 now
 that
 he
 sees


no
 reason
 to
 do
 so.
 Um
 the
 team
 are


going
 to
 put
 some
 of
 the
 headlines
 up
 on


the
 screen.
 But
 Carol,
 a
 significant
 uh


piece
 of
 news
 in
 because
 part
 of
 what
 we


wanted
 to
 discuss
 today
 was
 China.
 Uh


the
 president
 saying
 that
 he's


calculating
 increased
 tariffs
 on
 Chinese


products.
 This
 is
 a
 dialing
 up
 of


geopolitical
 tensions.


Brian,
 bear
 with
 us.
 We
 are
 now
 seeing


this
 quite
 sharp
 market
 reaction.
 Uh


clearly
 the
 S&P
 500
 has
 changed


direction
 here
 because
 I
 think
 well
 you


know
 jumping
 car
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the


point
 is
 that
 uh
 we
 were
 headed
 in
 a


different
 direction


and
 this
 brings
 so
 many
 questions
 around


what
 the
 Tik
 Tok
 relationship
 had
 been


and
 much
 of
 that
 had
 been
 sort
 of
 almost


this
 lynch
 pin
 in
 relationships
 between


President
 Xi
 and
 indeed
 President
 Trump


but
 then
 been
 this
 ongoing
 narrative


about
 how
 we
 could
 rectify
 and


rehabilitate
 the
 relationship.
 There


have
 been
 calls
 from
 China
 perhaps


wanting
 yet
 further
 relief
 from
 some
 of


the
 higher
 tariffs
 that
 they've
 been


seeing.


Sorry,
 I've
 just
 pulled
 up
 the
 truth


social
 post
 and
 that's
 where
 the


president's
 communicated
 and
 he's


basically
 saying
 uh
 that
 China
 is


becoming
 very
 hostile.
 Uh
 let's
 get
 back


to
 the
 conversation.


Your
 take
 Brian
 because
 in
 many
 ways


Andre
 and
 defense
 tech
 as
 a
 whole
 is


about
 the
 story
 of
 national
 security
 and


it
 is
 about
 US
 versus
 China.
 Is
 that


where
 you
 see
 the
 key
 risks?
 that
 that


is
 one
 of
 the
 the
 key
 conflicts.
 But
 if


you
 look
 worldwide,
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got


land
 wars
 in
 Europe.
 You've
 got,
 you


know,
 the
 Red
 Sea
 still
 basically


denied.
 Uh
 Iran
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it's


going
 to
 slow
 down
 anytime
 soon.
 Uh


China,
 beyond
 just
 the
 tensions
 with
 the


US,
 has
 been
 constantly
 aggravating
 with


uh
 the
 Philippines.
 Um
 you
 know,


constantly
 fighting
 over
 different


islands
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 Uh
 so


you're
 in
 this
 period
 of
 just
 massive


geopolitical
 instability,
 and
 China
 is


obviously
 the
 focus,
 but
 I
 mean,
 they've


had
 a
 very
 strategic
 view
 to
 this,


right?
 like
 they've
 uh
 blocked
 so
 they


put
 a
 significant
 export
 controls
 on


magnets
 for
 high-end


about
 rare
 earth
 for example
 we


understand
 the
 breaking
 news
 today
 as


well
 as
 China's
 making
 it
 harder
 and


harder
 for
 rare
 earth
 to
 be
 exported
 not


just
 the
 US
 but
 to
 Europe


yeah
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 part
 of
 a


long-term
 strategic
 plan
 they
 have
 had


right
 they
 have
 used
 industrial
 policy


uh
 beyond
 just
 military
 power
 to


construct
 a
 world
 where
 they
 have
 a
 lot


of
 leverage
 over
 the
 US
 and
 their
 allies


they
 drive
 dependence
 on
 these
 things


and
 it's
 a
 very
 sophisticated
 strategy


that
 they're
 playing.
 Uh
 I
 think
 this
 is


something
 that
 Trump
 recognizes.
 I
 think


he
 is
 a
 very
 good
 negotiator.
 If
 he's


saying
 these
 things,
 he
 understands
 what


that
 means
 and
 how
 he
 is
 using
 that
 to


position
 for
 maximum
 advantage.
 And
 so
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 run


conflict
 with
 China
 and
 that's
 something


we've
 just
 got
 to
 be
 prepared
 for.


Brian,
 thank
 you
 for
 rolling
 with
 this.


The
 news
 is
 this
 is
 breaking
 as
 we
 go
 to


air.
 The
 markets
 reacting.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 that
 we've
 just
 shown
 on
 on


the
 screen
 is
 the
 semiconductor
 index.


Yeah.


One
 reason
 why
 it's
 critically
 important


to
 talk
 to
 you
 and
 your
 efforts
 to


reonsure


the
 manufacturing
 base
 in
 this
 country


in
 Ohio.
 But
 in
 research
 for
 being
 here


today,
 Caroline
 and
 I
 looked
 a
 lot
 at


the
 supply
 chain
 for
 your
 industry.
 Why


everything
 from
 wire
 harness
 through
 to


to
 GPUs
 that
 go
 on
 board
 a
 lot
 of
 the


the
 the
 the
 weapons
 behind
 us.
 Um
 could


you
 just
 expand
 on
 that
 a
 little
 bit?


You
 know,
 why
 Arsenal
 1
 is
 so
 critical?


Yeah,
 in
 that
 sense
 in
 that
 context


absolutely
 so
 you
 know
 when
 you
 look
 at


defense
 is
 one
 of
 those
 areas
 where


national
 security
 is
 paramount
 uh


pulling
 these
 technologies
 onto
 US
 and


allied
 manufacturing
 is
 absolutely
 key


and
 the
 strategy
 we've
 taken
 with
 this


is
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 industrial
 capacity


in
 the
 US
 there's
 the
 ability
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 largely
 commercial
 industry


that
 can
 manufacture
 these
 things
 uh
 but


when
 you
 start
 stepping
 back
 there's


things
 that
 defense
 alone
 can't
 solve


right
 these
 are
 things
 like
 you
 know
 the


rare
 earth
 magnets
 germanmanium
 apply.


Um
 these
 are
 things
 that
 China
 has


strategically
 tried
 to
 strangle
 hold
 and


this
 will
 require
 beyond
 just
 stating
 as


a
 policy
 that
 you
 have
 sources
 from


America.
 The
 sources
 are
 very
 very


limited.
 This
 is
 areas
 where
 I've
 been


really
 encouraged
 by
 what
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 done
 around
 trying
 to


reignite
 this
 idea
 of
 how
 do
 you
 do


smart
 industrial
 policy?
 What
 is
 it


going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 the
 US?
 It's
 going


to
 look
 different.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a


combination
 of
 tariffs.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


a
 combination
 of
 things
 they
 did
 with


like
 MP
 materials,
 guaranteed
 offtake.


there's
 just
 this
 very
 different


strategy
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 taken
 to


really
 solve
 this
 on
 a
 country
 level


scale
 and
 for
 us
 we
 can
 be
 early


adopters,
 right?
 Like
 we
 can
 take


advantage
 of
 all
 those
 things
 and
 we're


building
 out
 a
 massive
 manufacturing


complex
 in
 Ohio
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 all
 of
 those
 suppliers
 in


the
 US
 and
 build
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 here
 on


shore.
 Okay,
 so
 the
 breaking
 news
 is


that
 the
 president
 has
 taken
 to
 Truth


Social
 and
 he
 is
 saying
 that
 it
 looks


like
 he
 now
 won't
 meet
 with
 China
 Xi
 and


and
 and
 things
 are
 changing.
 We
 will


discuss
 that
 for
 the
 next
 hour.
 While
 we


have
 you,
 um,
 Anderil
 has
 been
 in
 the


headlines
 partly
 because
 of
 the


insatable
 appetite
 of
 all
 kinds
 of


investors
 to
 be
 involved.
 You
 did
 a
 a


secondary
 or
 a
 tender
 for
 your


employees.
 Would
 you
 talk
 about
 the


focus
 you
 have
 right
 now
 on
 talent
 and


and
 and
 that
 mechanism
 to
 keep
 people


basically?


No,
 absolutely.
 So,
 um,
 the
 defense


world
 has
 shifted
 a
 lot,
 right?
 Like
 a


lot
 of
 the
 people
 in
 traditional
 defense


industry
 are
 amazing
 at
 things
 like,
 you


know,
 aircraft
 design
 and
 hypersonics


and
 things
 along
 those
 lines.
 Um,
 but


the
 next
 generation
 of
 this
 really
 looks


different.
 It
 really
 looks
 about


software.
 Looks
 how
 you
 adopt
 commercial


manufacturing
 approaches.
 It's
 how
 you


mass
 manufacture
 these
 capabilities.


It's
 a
 very
 different
 focus.
 We're


moving
 out
 of
 an
 era
 where
 we
 need
 to


make
 relatively
 few
 of
 very
 very


expensive
 high-end
 things.
 Uh
 we're


moving
 into
 an
 era
 where
 it's
 much
 more


about
 how
 do
 we
 have
 things
 at
 scale


that
 are
 smarter,
 that
 are
 more


autonomous.
 And
 so
 this
 ability
 to


attract
 the
 best
 talent
 into
 this
 really


is
 coming
 from
 tech
 companies.
 It's


coming
 from
 universities.
 It's
 people


who
 otherwise
 would
 have
 jobs
 at,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 all
 the
 tech
 company
 brand


names
 you
 would
 know.


Part
 of
 that
 compensation
 and
 liquidity


and
 all
 the
 startup
 economics,
 but


honestly,
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 it
 is
 just
 do


they
 get
 to
 work
 on
 exciting
 problems


with
 people
 they
 like
 on
 really
 on


things
 that
 really
 matter,
 right?
 And
 I


think
 we
 present
 this
 opportunity
 to
 be


very
 clear
 in
 our
 purpose
 and
 our


mission.
 something
 that's
 going
 to
 be


impactful
 and
 they
 get
 to
 work
 on
 just


amazing


cutting
 edge
 things,
 right?
 Like
 making


autonomous
 fighter
 jets
 and
 you
 know


these
 reusable
 missile.
 There's
 just
 an


absolutely
 crazy
 thing
 to
 work
 on
 if


you're
 a
 young
 engineer.
 Uh
 and
 that's


what
 we've
 really
 found
 is
 the
 formula


to
 get
 the
 best
 and
 brightest
 here
 is
 an


exciting
 opportunity
 to
 actually


contribute,
 give
 back,
 and
 build


something
 incredible.


Brian,
 what
 a
 joy
 to
 have
 you
 sat
 with


us
 rolling
 with
 breaking
 news
 and
 to
 be


surrounded
 by
 all
 of
 this
 gear
 that
 you


are
 driving
 innovation
 on.
 Brine
 Shrimp,


we
 appreciate
 you
 CEO
 of
 Anderil.
