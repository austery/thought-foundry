What
 a
 day.


What
 a
 day,
 folks.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we
 have
 had
 a
 more
 exciting
 day
 in


the
 stock
 market,
 particularly
 for
 AI.


We've
 definitely
 had
 some
 crazy
 days


this
 year,
 but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI


updates,
 what
 a
 day.
 What
 a
 day,
 ladies


and
 gentlemen.
 The
 most
 valuable
 company


on
 the
 planet,
 Nvidia.


$200.


Not
 only
 did
 it
 break
 200,
 it
 was
 198


when
 Tanner
 and
 I
 finished
 our
 GTC


stream.
 It's
 at
 203.
 Well,
 it
 hit
 203.


Right
 now,
 it's
 at
 2011.
 I
 mean,
 my


goodness,
 dude.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to


analyze,
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 today.
 We


got
 a
 bunch
 to
 get
 into.
 And
 so,
 we
 will


get
 into
 all
 that.
 Not
 to
 mention,
 we


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 earnings.
 So,
 in
 the
 next


15
 minutes,
 we
 will
 have
 a
 ton
 of


earnings
 to
 look
 through,
 all
 the


results
 on
 those
 earnings.
 And
 then


after
 those
 earnings,
 we'll
 get
 into


more
 of
 what
 happened
 today.
 You
 got


pound
 share
 right
 here
 back
 to
 190.


Tesla
 up
 1.63%.
 Robin
 Hoodie
 touched
 148


right
 now
 at
 147.
 SoFi
 nice
 recovery


fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 28
 right
 back
 to


3150.
 So
 getting
 a
 $31
 close
 which
 looks


like
 will
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 10
 minutes


is
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 productive.


AMD
 slightly
 flat
 on
 the
 day
 and
 then


you
 got
 the
 S&P
 500
 that
 did
 hit
 688.91


obviously
 being
 helped
 by
 Nvidia.
 Apple


also
 hit
 4
 trillion
 at
 one
 point.
 It's


losing
 4
 trillion
 uh
 now.
 It
 was
 at
 4


trillion
 about
 two
 hours
 ago.
 269
 right


here.
 And
 then
 Microsoft
 is
 holding
 4


trillion.
 Microsoft
 started
 off
 the
 day


by
 saying
 they
 officially
 have
 a
 27%


stake
 in
 OpenAI.
 That's
 a
 $1
 135
 billion


equity
 stake.
 And
 that
 kind
 of
 started
 a


bunch
 of
 the
 announcements
 that
 we
 got


today.
 Kind
 of
 capping
 it
 off
 with


Nvidia
 basically
 making
 the
 moves
 that


everyone
 was
 waiting
 for
 Nvidia
 to


officially
 make.
 That
 was
 said
 today.


Now,
 why
 is
 Nvidia
 down?
 There's
 a
 lot


to
 analyze,
 a
 lot
 to
 go
 through.
 We're


going to
 talk
 about
 what's
 happening


with
 Nvidia.
 The
 number
 one
 thing
 for


everyone
 to
 remember,
 and
 yes,
 we
 will


watch
 the
 Karp
 Jensen
 interview.
 I
 want


to
 watch
 the
 full
 interview,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 get
 through
 earnings.
 And
 so


after
 earnings,
 I'll
 play
 the
 entire


clip.
 It's
 about
 11
 minutes.
 You
 guys


can
 watch
 it.
 If
 you
 really
 want
 to


watch
 it
 right
 now,
 it's
 on
 my
 Twitter.


Twitter's
 in
 the
 description.
 So,
 if
 you


want
 to
 leave
 the
 stream
 right
 now,
 go


watch
 the
 interview
 first.
 It's
 on


Twitter.
 Um,
 but
 we
 will
 watch
 it
 all


together
 after
 after
 earnings.
 Uh,


Nvidia
 guided,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say


formally
 guided,
 but
 Jensen
 said
 it
 on


stage,
 so
 I
 guess
 the
 street
 is
 taking


it
 in
 as
 formal
 of
 a
 way
 as
 you
 can


imagine.
 uh
 $500
 billion
 dollars
 of


revenue
 over
 not
 the
 next
 six
 quarters


apparently
 it's
 over
 the
 next
 five


quarters
 which
 really
 changes
 things
 and


I
 think
 when
 that
 clarification
 was


announced
 that
 is
 when
 the
 stock
 really


started
 getting
 a
 move
 when
 he
 said
 500


billion
 it
 went
 from
 193
 to
 196
 and
 then


over
 the
 past
 hour
 when
 it
 was
 clarified


that
 he
 meant
 five
 quarters
 we
 bumped
 up


to
 200
 by
 the
 way
 that
 is
 excluding


China
 revenue
 Jensen
 said
 it
 would
 be


very
 nice
 to
 get
 China
 revenue
 but
 my


forecast
 of
 500
 billion
 over
 the
 next


five
 quarters
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


China
 revenue.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 the
 other


thing
 that's
 really
 important
 about
 this


is
 um


Jensen
 basically
 said
 the
 trajectory
 for


us
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to
 this
 revenue


growth
 is
 sustainable.
 And
 the
 street


has
 them
 at
 380
 billion.
 So
 you're


talking
 about
 a
 $120
 billion
 increase
 in


what
 the
 street
 was
 expecting
 over
 the


next
 five
 quarters.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you


got
 Nvidia
 right
 here
 pumping
 5%.
 Nvidia


has
 added
 250
 billion
 market
 cap
 to
 its


overall
 valuation
 today.
 What
 Jensen


said
 on
 China
 was
 quote,
 "A
 return
 to


China
 would
 be
 a
 huge
 bonus
 for
 Nvidia.


I
 assume
 the
 China
 market
 will
 remain
 at


zero
 for
 now.
 I'm
 confident
 Trump
 will


reach
 a
 good
 deal
 with
 China.
 The
 US


needs
 a
 lot
 more
 energy
 to
 sustain


industry
 growth.
 The
 AI
 sector
 is
 not
 in


a
 bubble.
 It
 represents
 a
 $500
 billion


opportunity
 over
 the
 next
 five


quarters."


So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 should
 we
 be
 trimming


our
 positions?
 You
 know,
 Tanner
 asked


that
 question
 a
 couple
 hours
 ago.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sound
 super


euphoric,
 right?
 And
 like
 and
 and


I
 I I
 get
 that
 all
 of
 us
 sound
 super


excited
 right
 now
 because
 we're
 all


bowled
 up
 and
 we
 got
 all
 these
 big


announcements,
 but
 I
 mean,
 if
 this
 is
 a


$500
 billion
 opportunity
 in
 the
 street


has
 them
 at
 380.
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 going


higher.
 Nvidia,
 remember,
 Nvidia
 is


still
 one
 of
 the
 more
 undervalued
 tech


companies
 that's
 out
 there
 when
 you
 look


at
 them
 on
 a
 forward
 earnings
 basis.
 If


Nvidia
 was
 trading
 at
 anywhere
 near
 its


actual
 valuation,
 I
 think
 Tanner
 has


them
 around
 245
 to
 250.
 You
 could
 say,


"Oh,
 that's
 an
 appropriate
 valuation
 for


Nvidia
 and
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 more
 expensive


than
 or
 more
 uh
 as
 cheap
 as
 Walmart
 or


or
 Costco.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know


about
 the
 forward
 projections
 right
 now.


I
 have
 to
 look
 at
 them,
 but
 Walmart
 and


Costco
 as
 of
 yesterday
 were
 still
 uh


more
 expensive
 than
 Nvidia,
 which
 is


insanity
 given
 they're
 not
 growing
 at


those
 levels.
 Microsoft
 right
 there,


that's
 up
 2%.
 PaloAlto,
 that's
 up
 74%.


Then
 Crowd
 Strike
 is
 also
 up
 right
 here


3%
 all-time
 high.
 So
 from
 that


perspective,
 I
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 a


sell.
 I
 don't
 think
 AMD
 is
 a
 sell.
 I


don't
 think
 Broadcom's
 a
 sell.
 I
 think


all
 these
 semiconductors
 are
 moving
 with


each
 other.
 Also,
 we
 got
 rate
 cuts


coming
 tomorrow.
 Broadcom,
 look
 at
 that.


Alltime
 highs
 at
 374.
 That
 one's
 moving


as
 well.
 And
 if
 you
 got
 rate
 cuts
 coming


along
 with
 a
 potential
 meltup,
 I
 mean,


there
 is
 a
 world
 where
 this
 thing
 really


gets
 exciting,
 then
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 think


it's
 the
 easiest
 sell
 at
 these
 levels.
 5


trillion
 is
 going
 to
 be
 at
 204.
 204.


We're
 at
 4.901
 trillion
 on
 Nvidia
 and
 we


are
 not


we
 are
 not
 uh
 not
 at
 5
 trillion
 yet.


Now,
 why
 are
 the
 data
 center
 plays


selling
 off?
 Honestly,
 I
 don't
 really


know.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 they
 had
 a
 bit
 of
 a


pump
 in
 the
 morning.
 Um
 I
 one
 could


argue
 and
 maybe
 someone
 has
 a
 better


reason
 than
 I
 have,
 but
 my
 my
 sort
 of


logical
 reason
 here
 is
 that
 um


people
 are
 selling
 some
 of
 these
 plays


to
 to
 pile
 into
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 Grab
 was


at
 freaking
 620
 in
 the
 morning.
 Now
 it's


at
 593.


Reddit
 was
 at
 220,
 now
 it's
 at
 214.


Google
 was
 at
 270,
 now
 26.
 I
 mean,
 you


got
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 that
 are
 just
 selling


off
 potentially
 because
 people
 are


rotating
 and
 they
 just
 want
 more


liquidity
 to
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 things
 like


an
 Nvidia
 or
 any
 of
 the
 companies
 that


Nvidia
 mentioned,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 you


got
 the
 Crowdstrike
 mentioned,
 you
 got


the
 Uber
 mentioned,
 uh
 you
 got
 the


Nebius
 Core
 mentioned,
 even
 though
 those


are
 more
 data
 center
 place
 and
 that's


why
 they're
 more
 volatile
 today.
 And
 you


finally
 got
 the
 Poundinger
 mentioned.
 We


are
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 that
 after


these
 earnings.
 Pounder
 18975.
 Jensen


and
 Karp
 finally
 were
 seen
 together
 for


the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 couple
 years


actually
 talking
 about
 their
 new


partnership.
 There
 they
 are
 together


right
 there
 on
 CBC.
 We're
 going
 to


listen
 to
 that
 later.
 But
 it
 is
 really


cool
 to
 see
 that
 happening.
 And
 I
 kind


of
 think
 Jensen
 was
 like
 Santa
 Claus


today
 and
 he
 kind
 of
 helped
 talk
 about


every
 single
 company
 that
 could
 benefit


in
 the
 overall
 AI
 stack
 and
 that's
 why


you
 see
 Nvidia
 getting
 some
 momentum.
 I


mean
 if
 we
 close
 above
 200
 that
 would
 be


bullish.
 Yes,
 we're
 not
 at
 203.
 Maybe
 we


don't
 close
 at
 2011.
 If
 we
 can
 just
 get


even
 like
 a
 198
 199
 close,
 I
 think
 would


be
 amazing.
 But
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 street


has
 some
 momentum
 to
 close
 above
 200.


There
 were
 a
 million
 shares
 waiting
 to


be
 sold
 at
 200.
 So,
 tons
 of
 buying


pressure
 coming
 in.
 262
 million
 shares


of
 volume
 today.
 158
 million
 is
 the


average.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 people


coming
 in
 today.
 Broccoli
 said
 red
 going


into
 FOMC
 may
 be
 a
 good
 thing.
 I
 agree.


You
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 all
 bowled
 up


before
 FOMC.
 want
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


pullback
 so
 that
 FOMC
 gives
 you
 some


room
 to
 run
 and
 then
 tomorrow
 we
 are


going
 to
 get
 FOMC
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be


important.
 All right,
 so
 what
 earnings


do
 we
 have?
 We'll
 talk
 a
 lot
 more
 about


AI
 and
 all
 the
 announcements
 of
 AI
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 earnings.
 So
 earnings
 will


probably
 be
 from
 like
 4
 to
 420.
 We


should
 get
 all
 the
 numbers
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 back
 to
 AI
 bookings
 today.


Visa,
 Nphase,
 Mandelus,
 Seagate,
 Bloom


Energy,
 EA
 Cheesecake,
 and
 then
 a
 few


more
 companies.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat


if
 anyone
 owns
 any
 of
 the
 names
 that


you're
 seeing
 right
 here
 on
 the
 screen.


Um,
 and
 we
 are
 going
 to
 try
 to
 get
 as


many
 of
 those
 numbers


that
 we
 can.


Why
 else
 do
 people
 think
 data
 centers


are
 dumping?
 Because
 I
 mean,
 again,
 my


reason
 is
 probably
 not
 the
 best
 that


people
 are
 selling
 to
 buy
 more
 Nvidia


because
 technically
 data
 center
 plays
 if


you're
 excited
 for
 Nvidia,
 right?
 So,
 I


don't know.
 I
 mean,
 you
 could
 also
 chalk


it
 up
 to
 ALGO.
 I
 know
 people
 hate


hearing
 that
 response,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them


ran
 together.
 They
 might
 be
 just
 getting


sold
 off
 together,
 which
 is
 not
 that


crazy.
 Again,
 all
 of
 these
 stocks
 are
 up


a
 lot
 this
 year.
 So,
 you
 know,
 every


time
 they
 get
 sold
 off,
 it's
 just


important
 to
 remember
 they
 are
 up
 a
 ton.


And
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 people


that
 potentially
 want
 to
 take
 some


profits,
 especially
 if
 they
 see
 a
 little


bit
 of
 the
 downside
 action.
 Let's
 do
 a


poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 I'm
 going


to
 pick
 four
 of
 these
 names.


Which
 one
 do
 you
 think
 outperforms
 in


the
 after
 hours?
 We
 got
 Visa,


Cheesecake,


uh
 let's
 do
 Booking,
 and
 let's
 put


Nphase
 up
 there.
 Which
 one
 do
 you
 think


outperforms
 in
 the
 after
 hours?
 NEO,
 the


robot
 company,
 they
 are
 officially


selling
 robots
 today
 for
 $20,000.
 That


was
 another
 big
 piece
 of
 news,
 which
 is


another
 catalyst
 for
 Nvidia
 because
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day,
 robots
 are
 going
 to


be
 powered
 with
 these
 chips.
 Here
 is
 the


video
 that
 they
 put
 out
 today
 showing


that
 these
 robots
 are
 officially
 for


sale.
 My
 name
 is
 Burnt
 and
 today
 we're


launching
 Neo,
 our
 humanoid
 for
 the


home.


She's


>> the
 audio,
 bro.
 The
 audio.
 Okay.
 So,
 we


can't
 play
 the
 song,
 but
 there
 is
 Neo.


It's
 going to
 be
 $20,000.


And
 um
 No,
 it's
 not
 the
 car
 company.


Neo.


Uh,
 look,
 it's
 I
 mean,
 it's
 exciting,


right?
 More
 humanoid
 robots.
 Obviously,


this
 is
 the
 the
 revolution
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 waiting
 for.
 I
 I
 wonder


how
 productive
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the


home.
 Can
 it
 actually
 do
 a
 ton
 of
 stuff?


Uh,
 can
 it
 actually,
 you
 know,
 wash
 the


dishes
 and
 do
 the
 laundry?
 If
 so,
 and
 if


it's
 actually
 20,000
 early
 access
 or


$500
 a
 month,
 if
 it
 actually
 is
 legit,
 I


mean,
 one
 like
 like
 really
 legit,
 not


just
 BS
 legit,
 but
 really
 I
 mean,
 one


could
 argue
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on


with
 Tesla?
 What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on


with
 Figer?
 What's
 going
 on
 with


Appronic,
 right?
 All
 these
 guys
 are


talking
 about
 this
 humanoid
 robot


revolution.
 Brett
 Adox,
 CEO
 of
 Figer,


was
 at
 GTC
 today.
 If
 this
 Neo
 company,


which
 I
 don't
 know
 much
 about,
 but
 if


they're
 launching
 these
 robots
 and


they're
 like
 legit,


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 is,
 you
 know,
 now


granted,
 I
 think
 Brett
 and
 Tesla
 are


going
 for
 industrial
 use
 cases
 like
 an


Amazon
 and
 Walmart,
 etc.,
 not
 just
 like


only
 being
 in
 the
 home.
 At least
 that's


what
 they
 publicly
 said.
 That's
 one
 of


the
 core
 things
 they
 want
 to
 focus
 on.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that
 NEO
 thing
 is
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 work
 inside
 of
 an
 Amazon


factory,
 but
 it
 is
 heating
 up.
 It
 is


absolutely
 heating
 up.
 Cheesecake
 is


Cheesecake
 Factory.
 Cheesecake
 Factory


is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of the
 stocks
 that


has
 earnings
 today.
 Now,
 Amazon
 as
 well.


Speaking
 of
 Amazon,
 broke
 through
 231


today.
 I
 think
 the
 layoff
 announcement


from
 yesterday
 along
 with
 general
 AWS


growth
 that
 is
 getting
 baked
 into
 some


of
 the
 assumptions
 especially
 because


OpenAI
 said
 they
 were
 going to
 buy
 $250


billion
 of
 Azure
 services
 today.
 So


overall
 bullish
 for
 the
 cloud
 even
 if


Amazon's
 not
 getting
 that
 revenue
 that


could
 be
 bullish
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why


Amazon's
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump
 but


obviously
 big
 tech
 earnings
 tomorrow
 is


really
 going
 to
 tell
 us
 what
 is
 playing


out.
 Neo
 is
 not
 a
 Chinese
 company
 I


think
 is
 uh
 is
 Neo
 robot
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 Chinese.
 There's
 a
 bunch
 of


humanoid
 robot
 companies
 that
 are


Chinese.
 No,
 no,
 it's
 from
 1x


Technologies.
 It's
 Norwegian.


This
 company
 is
 Norwegian.


Yeah.
 Founded
 in
 Norway
 in
 2014.
 Okay.


So,
 this
 one
 is
 not
 a
 Chinese
 company,


but
 they
 do
 have
 a
 robot
 that
 officially


is
 out
 there.
 Where's
 PayPal?
 We
 got


four
 minutes
 till
 the
 market
 closes.


Pay.
 Wow.
 PayPal
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 juice.
 It


was
 up
 15%
 now
 only
 up
 4%.
 Robin
 Hood


selling
 off
 a
 little
 bit
 right
 there.
 It


was
 at
 148,
 now
 at
 146.
 Uh
 S&P
 still


holding
 strong.
 Got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red


candle
 from
 688,
 but
 687
 will
 be
 great


on
 the
 close.
 So
 I
 think
 a
 3150
 close


people
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 sad
 about.
 And


then
 Nvidia
 $200
 close
 would
 be
 very


very
 excited.
 I
 mean,
 how
 do
 we
 feel,


dude?
 Nvidia
 200
 when
 Tanner
 and
 I
 were


live,
 we
 were
 just
 staring
 at
 it,


thinking
 it
 might
 have
 a
 shot
 to
 get


there.
 And
 then
 we
 closed
 the
 stream
 and


we
 stayed
 on
 for
 like
 10
 more
 minutes


and
 we're
 talking
 and
 it
 was
 at
 198
 and


we're
 like,
 "All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to


see."
 And
 then
 like
 literally
 I
 think
 10


minutes
 later,
 boom,
 busted
 through
 two


hundo.
 And
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the
 best
 GTCs


I've
 ever
 seen.
 I
 think
 I've
 watched


three
 of
 them
 over
 the
 past
 year.
 This


was
 the
 best
 one
 due
 to
 the
 scale
 of


partnerships
 that
 they
 announced.


Another
 big
 partnership
 that
 Jensen


talked
 about
 was
 the
 um
 the
 uh
 DOE.
 So


they
 now
 have
 seven
 new
 supercomputers


they're
 going to
 be
 building
 with
 the


Department
 of
 Energy.
 Same
 thing
 that


AMD
 announced
 yesterday.
 It
 was
 a
 $1


billion
 partnership.
 Jensen
 announced


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 investing


even
 more
 with
 the
 DOE.
 So,
 it
 just


looks
 like
 a
 lot
 more
 partnerships,
 a


lot
 more
 growth
 trajectory
 uh
 that's


baked
 into
 Nvidia
 and
 a
 ton
 of
 different


companies
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


working
 with
 to
 develop
 this
 entire
 AI


ecosystem.
 And
 all
 I
 can
 say
 is
 thank


you
 to
 Deepseek
 for
 giving
 us
 the
 dip.


Without
 that,
 we
 would
 not
 have
 had
 uh


or
 at least
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 and
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 here
 would
 not
 have
 had


the
 opportunity
 to
 develop
 a
 position.


So,
 there
 you
 go.
 Amit
 the
 entire


company
 stopped
 working
 near
 that
 200.


Yeah,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 one


of
 my
 uh
 friends
 who
 um
 he
 was,
 you


know,
 he's
 he's he's
 big
 into
 pounder


and
 he
 was
 uh
 he
 was
 like
 watching
 the


stream
 and
 he
 was
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 the


phone
 with
 a
 client
 and
 he's
 trying
 to


like
 just
 talk
 to
 the
 client
 and
 like


get
 the
 client
 to
 like
 go
 away
 and
 like


handle
 whatever
 but
 then
 he
 sees
 like


Jensen
 mentioned
 carp
 and
 he's
 just
 he


loses
 it
 like
 he's
 not
 able
 to
 focus
 on


the
 client
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was
 all
 of


us.
 It
 was
 very
 very
 hard
 to
 focus
 on


anything
 else
 today
 with
 the
 amount
 of


announcements
 we
 got
 and
 obviously
 the


pounder
 announcement
 was
 also
 a
 big


deal.
 This
 was
 uh
 this
 was
 my
 face
 as


soon
 as
 it
 happened.
 It
 was
 just
 finally


after
 four
 years
 it
 happened.
 But
 it


happened
 and
 so
 pretty
 exciting
 day.


Pretty
 exciting
 day.
 All right,
 here
 we


go.
 We
 got
 40
 seconds
 until
 the
 market


closes.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 earnings.
 So
 I


will
 try
 my
 best
 to
 get
 through
 all
 the


numbers
 and
 we
 will
 try
 to
 cover
 every


single
 company
 after
 the
 earnings.
 So


give
 us
 about
 20
 minutes,
 then
 we'll
 get


back
 into
 Jensen,
 Karp,
 AI,
 all
 the


stuff
 that
 has
 happened
 today.
 Um,


and
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 But
 let


me
 know
 which
 of
 these
 stocks
 you
 own
 in


the
 chat.
 We
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 them
 that


are
 coming
 up
 for
 today.
 I
 don't
 have
 a


position
 in
 any
 of
 them.
 And
 so
 I
 do


have
 Visa
 in
 the
 the
 uh
 stock
 draft,
 but


these
 are
 the
 names
 that
 we
 have
 and


we're
 going
 to
 look
 at
 what
 we've
 got


once
 we
 get
 these
 results.


All right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 Tuesday,


October
 28th,
 400
 p.m.
 One
 of
 the,
 I


would
 argue,
 biggest
 days
 for
 AI
 in
 this


entire


the
 stock
 market.


All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 Here


we
 go.
 Nvidia,


she
 gets
 the
 $200
 close.
 She
 gets
 the


$200
 close.
 201120


for
 Nvidia.
 Absolutely
 incredible
 to


see.
 Robin
 gets
 the
 146
 close.
 Pounder


gets
 189.
 Tesla,
 not
 sure
 why
 Tesla
 ran


today,
 but
 Tesla
 did
 run
 up
 1.8%
 460.


So,
 not
 too
 bad.
 Even
 after
 those


earnings,
 Tesla
 was
 able
 to
 make
 a
 move.


Uh,
 I
 mean,
 there
 was
 some
 Nvidia
 Uber


partnership
 that
 was
 announced.
 Every


GTC
 Jensen
 talks
 about
 self-driving
 cars


and
 then
 Tesla
 sells
 off
 and
 then
 you


know
 they
 don't
 really
 do
 much
 with
 that


partnership
 for
 whatever
 they
 announced


at
 GTC.
 So
 I
 think
 Tesla
 sold
 off
 a


little
 bit
 but
 then
 it
 recovered.
 460


right
 there
 on
 Tessy.
 Google
 down
 about


half
 a
 percent
 grab.
 I
 think
 the
 price


action
 was
 really
 stupid.
 I
 did
 buy
 more


shares
 today.
 I
 just
 think
 this
 is


getting
 dumb
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 getting


manipulated
 left
 and
 right.
 Like
 you


can't
 tell
 me
 it's
 at
 620
 at
 9:30
 and


then
 it
 drops
 a
 little
 like like
 I
 just


think
 they
 need
 a
 really
 good
 earnings


to
 get
 the
 shorts
 out
 of
 the
 stock
 and


unfortunately
 the
 shorts
 are
 still
 in


the
 stock.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 next


Monday
 it's
 going to
 be
 a
 big
 day
 for


grabb.
 Hopefully
 earnings
 can
 change
 the


narrative
 right
 now.
 I
 do
 think
 it's


getting
 manipulated
 left
 and
 right
 and


that's
 why
 that
 stock
 took
 a
 hit
 today.


Amcor
 by
 the
 way
 not
 a
 horrible


recovery.
 This
 thing
 fell
 to
 28
 got
 back


to
 3216.
 It
 was
 at
 33
 yesterday.
 So


Jensen
 said
 a
 bunch
 of
 good
 things
 about


American
 manufacturing
 of


semiconductors.
 That
 was
 also
 super


bullish
 for
 Amcor.
 Salesforce
 that
 was


down
 a
 little bit
 on
 the
 day.
 PayPal
 was


up
 4%
 after
 being
 up
 15%.
 ELF
 was
 up
 4%.


Apple
 up
 slightly
 on
 the
 day.
 Amazon
 up


1%.
 Meta
 basically
 flat.
 Bitcoin
 from


116
 to
 113.
 That's
 down.
 Ethereum.
 Wow.


Ethereum
 almost
 might
 lose
 4,000.
 Bit


mine
 right
 there
 5258.
 That
 was
 down
 2%


on
 the
 day.
 All
 right,
 earnings.
 Let's


get
 into
 it.
 What
 do
 we
 got?
 What
 do
 we


have?
 Bookings.
 We
 got
 a
 green
 candle
 on


bookings


that
 is
 up.
 Bloom
 Energy
 also
 a
 green


candle
 that
 is
 up.
 I
 will
 try
 to
 get


these
 numbers
 in
 just
 a
 second.
 Uh,
 so


far
 I
 see
 Bookings
 and
 Bloom
 Energy
 get


a
 beat.
 Seagate
 little
 bit
 red,


Cheesecake
 basically
 flat,
 Visa
 flat,


and
 then
 Nphase
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 green


candle
 as
 well,
 but
 no
 official


numbers
 yet.
 Yeah,
 stocks
 5,000.
 I
 like


I
 mean,
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 love
 having


these
 large
 share
 prices.
 I
 guess
 they


don't
 care
 about
 the
 volatility
 because


as
 you
 know
 the
 stock
 would
 split
 it


would
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 volatility
 but
 I


guess
 not
 I
 guess
 they
 want
 to
 keep
 it


the
 way
 it
 is.
 All
 right.
 So,
 what
 are


we
 looking
 for
 earnings?
 Even
 if
 you


don't
 own
 these
 names,
 we're
 looking
 for


beats
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 More


importantly,
 the
 top.
 More
 importantly,


the
 top.
 If
 we
 can,
 or
 sorry,
 the


bottom,
 the
 the
 EPS.
 If
 we
 can
 beat
 on


EPS,
 that
 means
 margins
 are
 increasing,


and
 that
 is
 better
 for
 companies.


Bookings
 beats
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom


4%
 and
 3%
 4%
 on
 EPS,
 3%
 on
 revenue.
 EPS


is
 up
 19%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is
 up


13%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 9
 billion


versus
 8.73.
 EPS
 9950
 versus
 95.92.


That
 is
 why
 bookings
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 of


a
 move
 right
 there.
 So
 you
 have
 a
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 beat
 and
 let's
 see
 if
 we


can
 go
 10
 for
 10
 on
 earnings
 today
 and


all
 these
 companies
 can
 beat
 top
 and
 the


bottom
 would
 be


very
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Uh
 next
 one


let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 pull
 this
 up.
 Um


this
 stock
 is
 I
 don't
 have
 this
 on
 the


list
 but
 Co-Star.
 I
 don't
 know if
 anyone


owns
 this
 one.
 This
 is
 CSGP.


It
 looks
 like
 they
 have
 a
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 is
 a
 $33
 billion


company
 beat
 by
 21%
 on
 EPS
 23
 cents


versus
 19
 cents
 expected
 and
 revenue
 833


million
 versus
 825
 million
 expected
 as


they
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 as


well.


CSGP
 Co-star
 is
 an
 American
 provider
 of


information
 analytics
 and
 marketing


services
 to
 the
 commercial
 property


industry
 in
 North
 America
 and
 Europe
 33


billion.
 That
 stock
 up
 after
 hours
 4%
 as


you
 can
 see
 right
 there
 on
 the
 screen.


There's
 that
 candle
 on
 the
 beat


with
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 Uh
 what


about
 Visa?
 Visa
 numbers
 are
 not
 out


yet.
 Still
 waiting
 for
 them.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 end
 up
 doing
 405
 410.


Don't
 have
 them
 yet.
 We
 have
 bookings


and
 we
 have
 Co-Star


right
 now.


Bloom
 Energy
 is
 moving,
 but
 I
 don't
 see


the
 numbers
 yet.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can


find
 those.
 Uh
 Bloom
 Energy,


I
 believe
 this
 is
 the
 after
 hours
 move.


By
 the
 way,
 SoFi
 did
 close
 above
 3150,


which
 is
 nice.
 No,
 Bloom
 is
 up
 1%.
 It


was
 up
 4%
 during
 the
 day,
 up
 1%
 after


hours,
 so
 probably
 not
 getting
 a
 massive


move
 yet.
 Cheesecake
 is
 not
 out
 yet.


Visa's
 call
 will
 be
 at
 5:00
 PM,
 but
 Visa


will
 be
 out
 pretty
 soon
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


the
 actual
 numbers,


but
 we're
 still
 waiting
 on
 those
 right


now.
 What
 did
 people
 do
 at
 SoFi
 today?


Did
 people
 sell
 calls?
 Did
 they
 take
 any


profits?
 Did
 they
 trim?
 Uh
 shout
 out
 to


our
 friend
 Josh,
 who's
 a
 friend
 of
 the


channel.
 His
 account
 is
 pushing
 10


million.
 It's
 It's
 basically
 like
 I


think
 it's
 almost
 like
 90%
 soy.
 He
 did


take
 some
 profits
 on
 some
 $25
 calls
 that


he
 sold
 or
 that
 he
 bought
 before


earnings.


I
 think
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 just


held.
 I
 mean
 either
 he
 bought
 the
 dip
 or


held


but
 SoFi
 still
 getting
 that
 3150
 close


which
 was
 nice
 to
 see.
 Sold
 some
 calls,


rolled
 some
 calls.


Bought
 2x
 lever
 at
 SoFi.
 Bought
 calls


when
 it
 dipped
 up
 150%.
 Not
 bad.
 I
 mean,


the
 28
 dip
 was
 kind
 of
 stupid
 with
 a


triple
 bead,


but
 there
 you
 go.
 Still
 holding
 my
 June


2027
 leaps.
 Nphase
 dumping.
 Are
 we


dumping?
 Nphase
 is
 dumping.


That
 is
 a
 real
 dump.
 Nphase
 is
 down
 7%,


9%
 now
 after
 hours.


Get
 the
 Nphase
 results
 in
 a
 second.
 Um,


that
 one
 is
 getting
 hit.
 Nphase.
 Wow.


Why
 are
 they
 dumping?
 Beat
 by
 36%
 on


EPS,
 90
 versus
 66.
 Beat
 by
 11%
 on


revenue,
 410
 versus
 369.


Really?
 They're
 going
 to
 dump
 it
 on
 a


double
 beat.
 And
 not
 just
 a
 small
 double


beat.
 Those
 are
 a
 double-
 digit
 double


beat,
 especially
 on
 EPS.
 Dude,
 I
 we're


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 run
 some
 stats,


but
 like
 the
 average
 beat
 on
 EPS,
 I


think,
 is
 in
 the
 double
 digits.
 I
 mean


we
 are
 seeing
 multiple
 15
 to
 20%
 beats


on
 EPS
 which
 is
 just
 showing
 margin


efficiency
 across
 the
 board.
 Solar
 I


don't
 think
 solar
 is
 dead.
 I
 do
 think


solar
 from
 a
 big
 beautiful
 bill


regulatory
 perspective
 is
 not
 in
 favor.


Um
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 weird
 because
 you


would
 think
 we
 need
 as
 much
 energy
 as


possible
 and
 if
 nuclear
 takes
 a
 lot


longer
 to
 set
 up
 than
 solar
 that
 we
 kind


of
 should
 be
 supporting
 solar
 a
 lot
 more


but
 you
 know
 this
 administration
 does


not
 care.
 Nphase
 right
 there
 still
 down


5%
 on
 the
 day.
 was
 down
 more,
 but
 now
 it


is
 down
 5%.
 Bloom
 Energy,
 I
 think
 we
 got


it.
 Let
 me
 pull
 it
 up.
 Uh,
 Bloom
 Energy,


ticker
 symbol
 BE.


Wow,
 a
 double
 beat.
 50%
 EPS
 15
 cents


versus
 10
 cents.


EPS
 is
 up,
 1600%


year-over-year.
 Revenue
 519
 versus
 428


beat
 by
 21%.


Bloom
 Energy
 starting
 to
 make
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move
 after
 hours.
 It
 was
 up
 5%


on
 the
 day.
 No,
 now
 it
 goes
 red.
 Well,


now
 it's
 flat.


Okay,
 now
 it's
 trying
 to
 keep
 moving.


But
 you
 have
 another
 double
 beat.


Another
 double
 beat.
 Visa


down.
 Visa
 don't
 have
 the
 numbers
 yet,


but
 Visa
 is
 down
 about
 2%.
 Street
 might


not
 love
 the
 numbers,


but
 Bloom
 Energy,
 that
 one
 is
 Yeah,
 look


at
 that.
 Look
 at
 Now
 she's
 moving.
 Now


BE
 is
 moving
 5%
 after
 hours
 with
 a


double
 beat.


With
 a
 double
 beat,
 EA
 is
 pumping.
 Okay,


what
 do
 we
 have
 on
 EA?
 EA
 Well,
 it's
 not


I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 pumping
 pumping,
 but


it
 is
 having
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 move.
 EA,


we
 have
 a
 This
 is
 our
 first
 miss.
 Uh
 EA


did
 have
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 beat.
 Well,
 not
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


beat.
 My
 goodness.
 EPS
 54%
 beat.
 54


cents
 a
 share
 versus
 35
 cents
 expected.


Revenue
 very
 slight
 miss
 by
 3%.
 I
 think


the
 streak
 can
 overlook
 that
 revenue


miss,
 but
 the
 EPS
 beat
 is
 the
 story.


Another
 50%
 beat
 on
 EPS.


You're
 just
 not
 seeing


uh
 a
 trend
 in
 companies
 not
 beating
 by


EPS
 and
 you're
 getting
 some
 of
 that


momentum.
 Visa,
 let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get


the
 earnings
 and
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 these


numbers.
 We'll
 check
 Seagate
 in
 a


second.
 Oh,
 here
 we
 go.
 We
 got
 Seagate


260
 versus
 240.
 That's
 another
 beat
 on


the
 bottom
 line
 and
 then
 a
 beat
 on
 the


top
 line.
 2.6
 versus
 2.55
 billion
 in


revenue.
 EPS
 is
 up
 65%
 year-over-year.


Revenue
 is
 up
 21%.


Seagate
 is
 are
 we
 flat
 after
 hours?


We're
 up
 2%.
 We're
 up
 2%.
 It
 was
 down
 a


little
 bit
 during
 the
 day.
 Up
 2%.
 But


again,
 another
 double
 beat.


It's
 not
 the
 best
 year-over-year.
 That


is
 correct.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


you
 know,
 these
 companies
 just
 have
 to


be
 able
 to
 beat
 the
 quarterly


expectations
 more
 than
 anything.
 And
 it


looks
 like
 most
 these
 companies
 are


beating
 it.
 Cheesecake
 not
 out
 yet.


Cheesecake
 not
 out
 yet.
 I
 do
 think
 we


have
 Visa.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 this


up.


Do
 we
 have
 Visa?


Um,
 let's
 see.
 I
 think
 Visa
 has
 a
 beat


on
 EPS
 as
 well.
 Not
 a
 massive
 beat.


Nphase
 bouncing
 back
 a
 little
 bit,


correct?
 But
 Nph
 still
 down.


Uh
 Visa,
 do
 we
 have
 it?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Visa


298
 versus
 297.
 That's
 a
 beat
 by
 1
 cent,


but
 1
 cent
 matters.
 And
 then
 10.72


versus
 10.62.
 That's
 a
 beat
 by
 1%.


Revenue
 is
 up
 12%
 year-over-year.
 EPS
 is


up
 10%
 year-over-year.
 Visa
 is
 down
 1%.


Okay,
 so
 doesn't
 care
 too
 much
 about


Visa.
 I
 think
 the
 narrative
 on
 Visa
 and


stable
 coins
 potentially
 hurting
 their


business,
 the
 broader
 financial
 system


being
 threatened
 by
 cryptocurrencies.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 something
 Visa
 is


embracing
 head-on
 and
 they're
 not
 really


hiding
 away
 from
 it.
 But
 I
 think
 that


more
 of
 as
 a
 narrative
 is
 associated


with
 their
 stock.
 The
 numbers
 for


Mastercard,
 Visa,
 etc.
 don't
 seem
 to
 be


disappointing
 this
 quarter
 at
 all.
 But


Visa
 right
 there
 down
 slightly


after
 hours.
 Um,


booking
 again,
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom,
 which
 is
 really
 good.
 EA's


up
 a
 little bit.
 Bloom
 Energy
 so
 far


having
 the
 best
 earnings
 after
 hours


with
 that
 move.
 Co-star
 was
 having
 a


decent
 earnings.
 Now
 that
 goes
 flat.


Mandles
 is
 down.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 the
 company


that
 owns
 Oreo.
 They
 said
 they're


cutting
 their
 advertising
 cost
 by
 40


million
 because
 of
 training
 on


generative
 AI
 models.
 They
 beat
 on
 the


top
 of
 the
 bottom.
 73
 cents
 versus
 71


cents
 expected.
 Beat
 by
 3%.
 9.74
 versus


9.68
 billion.
 They
 beat
 by
 1%.


SoFi
 had
 earnings
 in
 the
 morning.
 United


Health
 had
 earnings
 in
 the
 morning
 as


well.
 SoFi,
 United
 Health
 and
 PayPal
 had


a
 double
 beat.
 SoFi
 had
 a
 triple
 beat.


But
 all
 those
 companies
 did
 pretty
 good.


United
 also
 started
 recovering
 towards


the
 end
 of the
 day.
 It
 was
 down
 a
 bit.


It
 ended
 the
 day
 up
 what
 3.7.
 No,
 it


actually
 ended
 relatively
 flat,
 but
 it


was
 up
 during
 the
 day
 at
 some
 point.


Okay.
 So,
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 after


hours
 on
 any
 of
 these
 names.
 Still


waiting
 for
 cheesecake.
 Visa
 was
 I
 think


the
 most
 important
 and
 this
 one


relatively
 flat
 even
 though
 they
 got
 a


double
 beat.
 Seagate
 also
 double
 beat.


Mandles
 double
 beat.
 Bookings
 double


beat.
 EA
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 miss.


Bloom
 Energy
 getting
 the
 most
 love
 right


here.
 And
 that
 one's
 moving.
 Nphase
 is


also
 recovering
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 that


one
 got
 hit.
 Well,
 it's
 recovering
 a
 lot


more.
 It
 was
 down
 10.
 Now
 it's
 down
 two.


Uh
 crypto.
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on


with
 Bitcoin,
 but


that's
 a
 nasty
 $3,000
 candle
 over
 the


past
 couple
 hours.
 Joby
 uh
 just


announced
 something
 with
 Nvidia.
 That's


why
 Job's
 up.
 Uh
 Joby,
 what
 did
 they


say?
 They
 said
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 using


Nvidia
 tech
 to
 do
 something.
 Joby,
 we've


teamed
 up
 with
 Nvidia
 as
 the
 only


aviation
 launch
 partner
 for
 their
 new


IGX
 Thor
 platform.
 The
 powerful


collaboration
 is
 set
 to
 accelerate
 the


development
 of
 superpilot,
 bringing
 next


era
 autonomy
 and
 safety
 to
 electric


flight.


That
 is
 why
 Joby
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a


move.
 Is
 Archer
 getting
 a
 move
 on
 this?


Archer


is
 uh
 flat.
 Archer
 not
 moving
 too
 much


on
 that.


ETH
 is
 down
 as
 well.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


ETH
 and
 Bitcoin
 took
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 fall


towards
 the
 end
 of
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 morning


they
 were
 doing
 phenomenal.
 They
 were


really
 like
 I
 mean
 ETH
 was
 pushing


through
 4200
 but
 this
 one
 again.
 Wow.


ETH.
 Wow,
 dude.
 It
 just
 lost
 4,000.


Why
 is
 everyone
 selling
 ETH?


Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


Like,
 just
 hold
 it.
 Like,
 for
 it
 to
 go


up,
 you
 have
 to
 hold,
 not
 sell.
 What
 do


people
 not
 get?
 Like,
 we'll
 sell
 it
 when


it's
 higher,
 not
 here.
 Like,
 let's
 just


wait
 till
 5,000.


Can
 we
 do
 Can
 we
 not
 have
 some
 paper


hands?
 Goodness.


ETH
 continuing
 to
 get
 hit
 right
 here.


Nvidia,
 are
 we
 still
 holding
 200
 after


hours?
 All right.
 At least
 Nvidia
 is


holding
 200.


At
 least
 Nvidia
 is
 holding
 200.
 You


don't
 even
 own
 ETH?
 Yeah,
 but
 I
 own
 this


leveraged
 freaking
 treasury
 which
 needs


ETH
 to
 go
 up.
 So,


we
 just
 hold
 the
 freaking
 asset.
 Like,


goodness.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 there
 down


about
 3%
 as
 well.
 Um,


there
 you
 go.
 Those
 are
 most
 of
 the


earnings.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 through
 pretty


much
 all
 of
 them.
 Uh
 we'll
 talk
 more
 a


lot
 about
 the
 AI
 stuff,
 but
 I
 mean


you're
 not
 getting
 crazy
 reactions
 after


we
 don't
 have
 cheesecake
 yet.
 We
 should


be
 getting
 that
 soon.


We
 don't
 have
 cheesecake
 yet.
 STX
 is


pumping.
 Stargate.


See,
 again,
 this
 I've
 been
 telling
 I've


been
 saying
 this.
 Robin's
 really
 got
 to


fix
 this.
 Dude,
 I
 cannot
 see
 the
 after


hours
 move
 because
 they
 combine
 it
 with


the
 intraday
 move.
 So
 to
 me,
 it
 looks


like
 it's
 up
 1.4%
 24%
 but
 on
 Weeble
 I


get
 the
 accurate
 number.
 It's
 up
 5%.
 So


yes,
 you're
 right.
 Seagate
 is
 getting
 a


bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 here.


They
 really
 got
 to
 fix
 this
 dude.
 I
 told


them
 what
 it's
 like
 it
 makes
 it
 hard
 to


actually
 see
 the
 accurate
 numbers.
 But


Seagate,
 that
 one
 is
 up
 5%


in
 the
 in
 the
 after
 hours.
 What
 did


Nvidia
 announce?
 They
 announced
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 We'll
 talk
 all
 about
 it
 after
 we


get
 through
 earnings,
 but
 they
 announced


enough
 stuff
 to
 increase
 their
 market


cap
 by
 250
 billion.


It
 is
 not
 a
 chart
 settings
 thing.
 I


talked
 to
 their
 head
 designer.
 He
 he


acknowledged
 it
 was
 an
 issue
 and
 I
 was


like,
 "Dude,
 I'm
 not
 crazy,
 right?
 Like,


this
 is
 like
 this
 is
 something
 we
 need


to
 change."
 He's
 like, "Yes,
 yes,
 we


make
 sense.
 We
 get
 it.
 I
 just
 need
 them


to
 like
 push
 the
 update
 and
 change
 it
 so


that
 it's
 easier."
 Uh,
 Cheesecake,
 we


don't
 have
 the
 earnings
 yet.
 Not
 on


Cheesecake.


Still
 waiting
 on
 that.
 Is
 Visa
 making
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump?


SoFi
 3150.
 Visa.
 H,
 it
 went
 green.
 It


was
 red.
 Went
 green.


which
 is
 good.


Tess
 says,
 "I've
 got
 a
 meeting
 with
 Vlad


on
 the
 13th
 in
 London."
 All
 right,
 Tess.


There
 you
 go.
 That
 is
 uh
 if
 he's
 coming


to
 the
 UK
 to
 speak
 to
 the
 Brits,


then
 which
 makes
 sense
 because
 they


opened
 up
 shop
 in
 UK
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2023.


That'll
 be
 a
 chance
 to
 talk
 to
 Mr.
 Vlad.


PaloAlto,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Microsoft
 is
 up
 2%
 again.
 That
 was
 at


550
 in
 the
 morning.
 Nvidia
 still
 holding


these
 levels


at
 200.
 Cakes
 at
 five
 o'clock.
 Okay.
 I


thought
 it
 was
 usually
 earlier
 the
 calls


at
 five,
 but
 if
 the
 numbers
 are
 at
 five,


then
 that
 one
 we'll
 wait
 on.
 Uh
 I
 think


that's
 what
 we
 got,
 folks.
 That's
 what


we
 got
 on
 earnings.
 Let
 me
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 coverage
 on
 bookings
 right
 here,


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Then
 we'll
 get
 into
 all
 the
 AI


conversation
 that
 happened
 today.
 Just
 a


massive
 day
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 If
 you


own
 Nvidia,
 I
 mean,
 this
 was
 one
 of


those
 days
 that
 uh
 quite
 frankly
 could


be
 a
 gamecher,
 could
 eliminate
 us
 from


ever
 having
 to
 see
 the
 the
 170s,
 180s


again.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 that


optimistic
 about
 it,
 but
 what
 he


announced
 today
 along
 with
 the
 earnings


estimates
 that
 I
 think
 are
 going
 to
 go


higher,
 aka
 the
 upgrades
 that
 should
 be


coming
 out
 soon.
 That
 could
 be
 a
 massive


deal
 for
 Nvidia.


>> Analysts
 were
 expecting
 only
 9566


revenue
 of
 9
 billion
 also
 topping


estimates.
 Booking
 says
 it
 is
 seeing


steady
 travel
 demand
 trends
 so
 far
 in


the
 current
 quarter
 and
 you
 can
 see


those
 shares
 are
 popping
 5%.
 So
 perhaps


an
 echo
 of
 what
 we've
 heard
 from
 some
 of


the
 uh
 airlines
 already
 this
 earning


season
 as
 well.
 It's
 clear
 that
 the


markets
 have
 been
 dominated
 this
 year
 by


the
 tech
 trade.
 The
 NASDAQ
 100
 is


outpacing
 all
 other
 indices.
 It's
 almost


18%
 above
 its
 200day
 moving
 average.


That's
 the
 most
 since
 2024
 right
 before


a
 correction.
 this
 as
 we
 go
 into
 the


most
 crucial
 two
 days
 of
 the
 earnings


season
 with
 Alphabet
 and
 Meta
 reporting


tomorrow
 and
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 reporting


on
 Thursday.


>> All right,
 we
 got
 cheesecake.
 We
 got


cheesecake.
 What
 do
 we
 got?
 You
 saw


bookings
 right
 there.
 Cheesecake.


Uh
 EPS


68
 cents


revenue
 missed.
 EPS
 beat
 revenue
 missed


even
 though
 revenue
 is
 still
 up
 5%


year-over-year.


Okay.
 So,
 you
 have
 a
 miss
 and
 a
 and
 a


and
 a
 beat
 for
 the
 Cheesecake
 Factory,


which
 is
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 restaurants,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 they
 got
 a
 miss
 and
 a


beat.
 Is
 that
 stock
 getting
 hit?


Cheesecake
 right
 here.
 It's
 up
 1%.


It's
 up
 1%.


Street
 expected
 912
 of
 revenue.
 We
 got


9007


60
 cents
 of
 EPS,
 68
 cents.
 Again,
 the


EPS
 beats,
 I
 mean,
 very
 few
 companies


are
 not
 beating
 by
 EPS.
 And
 that's
 what


matters,
 I
 would
 say,
 more
 than
 revenue.


Revenue
 is
 more
 a
 function
 of
 demand.


EPS
 is
 more
 so
 a
 function
 of
 internal


efficiencies.
 Because
 if
 you
 can


actually
 squeak
 out
 a
 profit
 and
 then


increase
 the
 margin
 at
 which
 you're
 able


to
 squeak
 out
 that
 profit
 after
 all
 your


expenses
 as
 a
 public
 company,
 it
 means


you're
 a
 big
 boy
 company.
 Means
 you


deserve
 to
 be
 owned
 by
 the
 public.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 proving
 that


they
 deserve
 capital
 as
 they're
 beating


on
 EPS,


which
 is


very,
 very,
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Again,
 why


is
 Bitcoin
 down?
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 Bitcoin's


been
 up
 and
 down
 throughout
 the
 month
 of


October.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 really
 not
 had
 a


trend.
 It's
 kind
 of
 been
 stuck
 around


this
 110
 115
 range,
 but
 it
 is
 getting
 a


pretty
 nasty
 candle
 right
 there,
 112.7.


And
 obviously,
 ETH
 is
 going
 down
 with


it.
 Maybe
 people
 are
 selling
 Bitcoin
 to


buy
 Nvidia.
 Again,
 that's
 a
 pretty


stupid
 reason,
 but
 like
 I
 don't
 really


have
 any
 other
 of
 reason.
 Is
 gold
 still


down
 on
 the
 day?
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 Gold's
 still


down.
 It's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 was
 in
 the


morning,
 but
 still
 down
 below
 4,000.
 So


this
 whole
 argument
 about
 people
 are


selling
 gold
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean


maybe
 but
 Bitcoin
 price
 action
 not


necessarily
 showing


that's
 the
 case.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Uh
 that's
 what
 you've


got
 here.
 Did
 Regeneron
 have
 earnings


today?
 Did
 they?
 Regeneron
 was
 up
 11%
 on


the
 day.
 I
 don't
 think
 these
 guys
 had


earnings.
 $67
 billion
 pharmaceutical


company.


Not
 sure
 what
 I
 saw
 in
 the
 headline,
 but


that
 one
 is
 up
 12%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 do
 not


believe
 they
 had
 they
 had
 earnings.


I
 mean,
 there's
 obviously
 some
 whales


that
 are
 probably
 selling
 their
 Bitcoin


as
 well,
 which
 is
 weird,
 right?
 Because


we
 have
 a
 rate
 cut
 coming
 tomorrow,


which
 is
 very
 bullish
 for
 liquidity,
 the


broader
 M2
 money
 supply.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


not
 only
 do
 we
 have
 a
 rate
 cut,
 we


basically
 have
 a
 function
 of
 uh


quantitative
 easing,
 as
 JPA
 will


probably
 signal
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 get


ready
 to
 stop
 quantitative
 tightening.


So
 you
 have
 two
 forces
 that
 should
 be


incredibly
 important
 for
 risk
 on
 assets


and
 and
 and
 stimulative.
 So
 it
 is
 a


little
 weird
 to
 see
 it
 kind
 of
 get
 a
 hit


right
 before
 we
 get
 into
 those


announcements,
 but
 it
 also
 could
 be


priced
 in.
 Invidia
 right
 here
 2011
 176


that's
 still
 up
 after
 hours
 on
 the
 S&P


500
 at
 687.
 Uh
 CCJ
 Kamico,
 they
 got
 a


big
 announcement
 today
 with
 uh


Brookfield
 and
 as
 a
 result
 a
 lot
 of the


uranium
 nuclear
 stocks
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a


pump.
 Camo
 right
 they're
 up
 24.68%
 on


the
 day.
 Oaklo
 was
 down
 a
 little
 bit.


Nanuclear


was
 up
 2.78%.
 Regeneron
 did
 have


earnings.
 Okay,
 I
 will
 try
 to
 get
 those


numbers.
 I
 did
 not
 see
 them
 anywhere.


But


oh,
 that
 it
 probably
 happened
 in
 the


morning,
 right?


Might
 have
 happened
 in
 the
 morning
 if
 it


pumped
 throughout
 the
 day,
 but
 I'll
 try


to
 get
 those
 numbers
 as
 well
 and
 see.


Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 that
 is
 what
 we
 got.


JPAL
 will
 speak
 at
 2:30
 tomorrow.
 I'll


be
 live
 pretty
 much
 the
 whole
 day.
 So,


at
 2
 PM,
 uh,
 we
 got
 the
 the


announcement.
 I'll
 be
 live
 and
 I
 think


I'm
 gonna
 be
 live
 the
 whole
 day
 from


market
 opens,
 market
 close
 because
 we


got
 a
 lot
 of
 tech
 earnings
 as
 well.


Tomorrow's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive


day.
 Um,
 but
 we'll
 get
 the
 decision
 at
 2


PM
 and
 then
 at
 2:30
 we
 get
 JPAL


and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 goes
 from


there.


Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 AI
 and


let's
 talk
 about
 what
 happened
 today


with
 Nvidia.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 have


technical
 Tuesday
 today.
 Again,
 it
 just


makes
 no
 sense
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 TA
 when


you
 have
 all
 these
 companies
 reporting


earnings.
 But
 we
 should
 be
 good
 for
 next


week
 and
 we'll
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 those


earnings
 done,
 which
 will
 uh
 which
 will


help
 us
 kind
 of
 analyze
 the
 technical


moves
 that
 they
 made
 as
 well.


All right.
 So,
 what
 happened
 today?


Well,
 Nvidia
 basically
 said
 that
 the
 AI


revolution
 is
 not
 slowing
 down,
 that
 the


AI
 revolution
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 be


as
 strong
 as
 uh
 Jensen
 has
 laid
 out
 for


the
 vision
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.


And
 most
 importantly,
 he
 guided
 for
 $500


billion
 of
 revenue
 over
 the
 next
 five


quarters.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


business
 update,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 street


estimates
 can
 go
 a
 bit
 higher.
 We're


going
 to
 have
 Jose
 join
 in
 just
 a
 second


as
 well
 to
 kind
 of
 give
 his
 thoughts
 on


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Nvidia.
 I'll
 start


by
 sharing
 this
 video
 before
 we
 watch


the
 full
 carp
 interview.
 Um,


actually,
 why
 don't
 we
 watch
 the
 full


carp
 interview?
 Let's
 let's
 let's
 get


that
 out
 of the
 way.
 So,
 here
 was
 Jensen


and
 Karp
 on
 CBC
 for
 those
 that
 haven't


seen
 it.
 This
 is
 what
 they
 had
 to
 say.


Very
 big
 deal
 for
 Nvidia
 and
 Palanteer.


And
 quite
 frankly,
 the
 amount
 of


partnerships
 they
 announced
 today
 was


really
 important
 for
 the
 overall
 AI


sector,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


stocks
 got
 a
 bid,
 but
 they
 especially


focused
 on
 Palanteer.
 And
 here's
 what


Jensen
 and
 Karp
 had
 to
 say
 together
 for


the
 first
 time
 as
 uh
 as
 they
 were
 on


CNBC.
 And
 I
 I
 just
 Alex,
 I'm
 actually


going
 to
 start
 with
 you.
 Uh
 the
 CEO
 of


Palanteer
 just
 to
 explain
 does
 that
 mean


no
 human
 intervention?
 Can
 you
 just


explain
 how
 this
 would
 work
 and
 used


Lowe's
 as
 an
 example?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I'm
 delighted
 to
 be


on
 the
 stage
 with
 uh
 what
 many
 people
 I


believe
 to
 be
 one
 of the
 great


entrepreneurs
 of
 of
 my
 lifetime
 and
 a


patriot.
 Um
 and
 it
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 me
 to


be
 here.
 Um
 uh
 so
 we
 we
 have
 a
 product


called
 Ontology.
 You
 could
 think
 of
 it


as
 uh
 a
 essentially
 a
 digital


representative
 of
 your
 enterprise


including
 security
 model
 which


essentially
 takes
 the
 disabilities
 that


have
 large
 language
 models
 and
 allows


you
 to
 move
 decision-m
 to
 the
 front
 line


with
 people
 without
 people
 depending
 on


how
 you're
 doing
 it.
 um
 in
 the
 context


of
 loaves
 and
 and
 other
 enterprises


allows
 you
 to
 essentially
 automate


decision-
 making
 like
 how
 would
 your


supply
 chain
 work
 how
 would
 it
 work
 if


it
 changed
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 get
 the


cheapest
 good
 to
 the
 right
 place
 given


that
 there
 may
 be
 disruption
 but
 in


general
 what's
 very
 very
 special
 I


believe
 about
 our
 our
 partnership
 is


we're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 move
 2x
 and
 I


think
 in
 the
 future
 even
 faster
 so
 you


get
 a
 much
 much
 faster
 and
 actually


because
 you
 can
 control
 it
 in
 a
 more


granular
 way
 much
 faster
 much
 cheaper


and
 then
 the
 macro
 thing
 that
 I'm


actually
 most
 excited
 about
 which
 for


our
 country
 is
 because
 of
 that
 you
 can


do
 manufacturing
 in
 America
 you
 can
 make


the
 workers
 stronger
 and
 better
 and
 you


have
 more
 competition
 because
 you
 can


use
 openw
 weight
 models
 open
 source


models
 you
 can
 use
 you
 can
 use
 any


hyperscaler
 you
 can
 decide
 not
 to
 use
 a


hyperscaler
 this
 is
 much
 much
 better
 for


America
 much
 better
 for
 workers
 much


better
 for
 industry
 it's
 cheaper
 it's


faster
 and
 obviously
 they
 have
 one
 of


the
 world's
 top
 tech
 teams
 and
 we
 work


very
 well
 with
 them


>> so
 Jensen
 just
 in
 in
 regards
 to
 that


collaboration
 then
 who
 would
 actually
 be


procuring
 the
 hardware
 Is
 this
 like
 a


company
 like
 Lowe's?
 Do
 they
 have
 to
 put


the
 upfront
 cost
 uh
 you
 know
 with
 their


existing
 GPUs
 and
 then
 working
 with


Palunteer?
 Is
 that
 how
 it
 works
 or


>> First
 of
 all,
 it's
 amazing
 to
 think
 that


the
 Palunteer
 ontology
 platform
 has


achieved
 all
 of
 this
 and
 they're
 the


fastest
 enterprise
 growing
 platform
 in


the
 world.
 Um
 uh
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 it


gives
 enterprises
 what
 we
 all
 want
 which


is
 intelligence
 and
 and
 the
 ability
 to


make
 good
 decisions
 fast.
 and
 and
 now


we're
 going
 to
 supercharge
 it
 with


Nvidia's
 accelerated
 computing
 for
 the


first
 time.
 And
 so
 Nvidia's
 CUDA


accelerated
 computing
 is
 going
 to
 get


integrated.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


put
 uh
 Nvidia's
 AI
 libraries
 on
 top
 of


that
 and
 open
 source
 model
 that
 that


we're
 working
 on
 together
 in
 into
 the


anttology
 platform
 and
 you'll
 run
 it
 in


the
 cloud
 any
 cloud
 or
 you
 run
 it
 on


prem
 or
 even
 a
 private
 cloud.
 And
 so,
 as


you
 know,
 Nvidia
 runs
 everywhere.
 And


so,
 you
 could
 buy
 a
 server
 from
 HP
 or


Dell.
 Uh,
 you
 could
 be
 in
 another


country
 and
 you
 want
 to
 set
 up
 your
 own


private
 cloud.
 We
 got
 no
 trouble
 with


that.
 And
 and
 so,
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 We


run
 everywhere.
 And
 Palanteer
 runs


everywhere.


>> But
 you're
 talking
 about
 the
 future


then.
 So,
 this
 isn't
 something
 that


would
 be
 accretive
 to
 revenues
 just
 in


the
 near
 term.
 You're
 still
 working
 it


out.
 And
 like
 I
 know
 Lowe's
 is
 an


example,
 but
 are
 there
 other
 customers?


>> Well,
 at
 Palanteer,
 we
 just
 do
 what's


best
 for
 our
 customers.
 We
 work


downstream
 for
 value
 creation.
 We


believe
 we
 know
 when
 it's
 faster,


better,
 more
 accurate
 and
 more
 flexible


and
 uh
 creates
 a
 better
 future
 for
 them


because
 they
 can
 choose
 how
 they
 want
 to


run
 their
 applications,
 we'll
 do
 very


well.
 And
 at
 Poundier,
 we
 we're
 doing


very
 well
 on
 revenue
 and
 profit.
 And


we're,
 you
 know,
 that's
 not
 actually
 our


primary
 motivation
 now.
 And
 the
 reason


we've
 done
 so
 well
 on
 profit
 and
 on


growth
 is
 because
 you
 just
 have
 to


create
 value.
 this
 creates
 more
 value


for
 the
 end
 user
 be


>> and
 but
 you
 just
 said
 before
 too
 that


the
 human
 may
 not
 even
 be
 involved
 with


some
 of
 these
 decisions
 and
 I
 guess
 that


is
 a
 major
 concern
 in
 this
 day
 and
 age


that
 AI
 efficiencies
 could
 take
 away


from
 or
 displace
 the
 job
 force.
 So


>> couldn't
 something
 like
 this


collaboration
 do
 that?


>> Uh
 you
 know
 it's
 interesting
 when
 you


say
 humans
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 in
 the
 loop


that
 doesn't
 inherently
 mean
 there


aren't
 cases
 where
 humans
 need
 to
 be
 in


the
 loop.
 For
 example,
 40
 years
 ago,
 we


had
 40x
 we
 had
 40
 we
 40
 with
 40x
 more


manufacturing
 jobs
 than
 we
 have
 now.
 So


it's
 like
 you
 can
 make
 more
 more


manufacturing
 jobs
 which
 are
 humans,


workingclass
 humans.
 You
 can
 build


things
 you
 couldn't
 build
 in
 the
 past.


And
 those
 humans
 become
 more
 and
 more


valuable
 than
 they
 were
 in
 the
 past.
 In


the
 defense
 context,
 you
 have
 situations


where
 humans
 have
 to
 be
 in
 the
 loop.


Offense
 situations
 where
 humans


shouldn't
 be
 in
 the
 loop
 like
 defense.


Our
 collaboration
 makes
 all
 those
 use


cases
 better
 for
 workers,
 for


manufacturing,
 for
 defense,
 for
 offense,


and
 in
 general
 because
 it
 allows
 people


to
 use
 any
 kind
 of
 model,
 any
 kind
 of


compute
 structure,
 it
 makes
 America


stronger
 and
 better.
 Whenever
 a
 business


is
 more
 productive,
 whenever
 they
 can


move
 faster,
 their
 business
 grows,
 they


hire
 more
 people.
 And
 so,
 so
 I
 think


this
 this
 idea
 that
 that
 AI
 uh
 is
 going


to
 take
 jobs
 is
 going
 to
 change


everyone's
 job.
 That's
 for
 sure.
 But
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 make
 companies
 more


productive.
 We're
 more
 productive
 today


because
 of
 AI.
 We're
 hiring
 more
 people.


>> I
 know.
 And
 we
 saw
 some
 leaders
 of


smaller
 companies,
 startups
 that
 have


been
 around
 for
 just
 three
 years,


valuations
 of
 $39
 billion,
 400


employees.
 And
 clearly
 that
 is
 a


beneficiary
 of
 uh
 using
 AI.
 But
 I
 wonder


with
 your
 proximity
 to
 the
 White
 House


right
 now,
 you
 you're
 here
 quite
 often.


Is
 that
 a
 concern
 that
 you're
 hearing


from
 them?
 Like
 what
 about
 the
 workers?


We
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're
 not


displacing
 them.
 And
 is
 there
 anything


that
 you
 guys
 are
 Nvidia
 in
 particular


is
 doing
 with
 the
 White
 House?


>> Look,
 look
 at
 what
 President
 Trump
 is


doing.
 The
 first
 thing
 he
 my
 first
 phone


call,
 my
 first
 meeting
 with
 them,
 it's


manufacturing
 in
 America.
 Move


manufacturing
 back
 to
 United
 States.
 It


creates
 tons
 of
 jobs.
 If
 we
 could
 if
 we


could
 move
 manufacturing
 the
 core


technology,
 we
 have
 better
 security,


national
 security.
 We
 have
 create
 more


jobs.
 Second,
 because
 we're
 talking


about
 the
 AI


industrial
 revolution,
 all
 of
 these
 AI


factories
 creates
 a
 ton
 of
 jobs.
 And
 so


we're
 we're
 really
 he's
 really
 in
 the


job
 creation
 mode
 bringing
 manufacturing


back
 to
 United
 States.
 And


>> AI
 is
 is
 is
 exceedingly
 good
 for


workingclass
 workers.
 Now
 you
 could


argue
 is
 it
 good
 for
 consultants
 and


people
 that
 that's
 a
 very
 different


debate.
 But
 you're
 going
 to
 see


remanufacturing.
 How
 would
 you
 build
 a


culturally
 specific
 enterprise
 like
 we


power
 Panasonic
 batteries?
 It's
 like
 you


are
 you're
 building
 something
 that


otherwise
 would
 have
 had
 to
 be
 built
 in


Japan.
 Now
 you
 can
 build
 it
 in
 America.


You
 can
 have
 train
 the
 workers
 so
 that


they
 can
 behave
 like
 Japanese
 engineers.


That's
 all
 AI
 augumentation.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 the
 workers
 are
 more
 valuable
 and


just
 like
 us,
 they
 get
 paid
 more
 because


they're
 more
 valuable.


>> Everybody
 knows
 how
 to
 use
 an
 AI
 because


AI
 is
 smart.
 And
 so
 AI
 is
 the
 first


technology
 that
 has
 closed
 the


technology
 divide.
 Everybody
 who
 didn't


know
 how
 to
 program
 computers
 in
 the


past,
 they
 know
 exactly
 how
 to
 program
 a


computer
 now.
 It's
 called
 AI.


>> But
 for
 the
 workforce
 in
 general
 trying


to
 learn
 all
 of
 that,
 it
 does
 take
 time.


So
 do
 you
 think
 that
 maybe
 we're


overestimating
 the
 benefits
 of
 this
 AI


buildout
 in
 the
 near
 term
 which
 is


reflected?


>> Let
 me
 sorry
 here.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 push


back
 on
 this
 narrative.
 It's
 not
 first


of
 all
 AI
 makes
 America
 the
 dominant


country
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 just
 start


there.
 Every
 other
 country
 in
 the
 world


like
 I
 spent
 half
 my
 life
 in
 Europe.


They're
 whining
 and
 crying
 and
 it's
 it


it's
 like
 we
 have
 the
 right
 chips.
 We


have
 the
 right
 software.
 We
 have
 the


right
 engineers.
 We
 have
 the
 right


culture.
 We
 have
 the
 right
 people.
 The


risk
 appetite.


>> Risk
 appetite.
 Right
 people
 to
 ask


questions.
 uh
 the
 whole
 thing
 is


combining
 to
 become
 a
 juggernaut
 and


then
 and
 and
 then
 and
 like
 then
 you


these
 these
 these
 partnerships
 happen


and
 that
 just
 throws
 gasoline
 on
 the


fire
 se.
 So
 the
 classic
 the
 real


question
 is
 will
 the
 GDP
 growth
 acrue
 to


all
 Americans
 or
 just
 wealthy
 Americans


and
 the
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 it
 depends


what
 you
 do
 but
 I
 deeply
 believe
 I
 think


we
 deeply
 believe%


>> well
 no
 manufacturing
 jobs


>> you
 build
 if
 you
 build
 manufacturing


jobs
 which
 is
 what
 this
 president
 wants


to
 do
 can
 you
 build
 them
 yes
 how
 do
 you


build
 them
 you
 need
 AI
 can
 you
 train
 the


people
 can
 you
 upscale
 them
 yes
 if
 you


use


>> mechanicals
 electricals
 and
 plumbers
 and


construction


>> and
 that
 I
 know
 the
 red
 tape
 you've


discussed
 it
 but
 nuclear
 reactor
 The


number
 one
 thing
 of
 this
 administration


is
 pro-
 power
 growth.


>> Look
 at
 all
 the
 power
 generations
 that


he's
 approved.
 Look
 at
 all
 the
 DOE
 land


and
 energy
 he
 they've
 approved.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 really
 about
 this
 is
 a


pro-energy
 growth
 administration,
 pro-


manufacturing
 administration.
 And


President
 Trump
 is
 pro
 jobs.
 When
 these


things
 all
 come
 together,


>> yeah,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


>> Is
 that
 why
 you
 said
 make
 America
 great


again
 at
 the
 That's
 the
 first
 time
 I've


heard
 you
 say
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 a


speech
 for
 GTC.
 Well,
 I
 was
 thanking


everybody
 in
 the
 room.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


look,


>> but
 was
 that
 also
 a
 communication
 to
 the


president
 because
 you
 were
 expecting
 him


here,
 right?


>> Uh,
 no,
 he's
 he's
 in
 Asia.
 I'm


>> No,
 but
 I
 thought
 you
 had
 said
 on
 a


earlier
 panel
 that
 you
 were
 expecting


>> Well,
 I
 just
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 we're


making
 America
 great
 again.
 I
 I
 think
 um


uh
 all
 of
 the
 all
 of
 his
 policies


relating
 to
 energy
 and
 manufacturing
 and


um
 all
 of
 his
 all
 of
 his
 uh
 enthusiasm


behind
 uh
 artificial
 intelligence
 and


making
 sure
 that
 that
 American
 AI


technology
 is
 the
 standard
 of
 the
 world


that
 it's
 m
 it's
 is
 diffused
 um


maximally
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 rest


of
 the
 world
 has
 the
 benefit
 of
 American


technology
 so
 they
 can
 build
 on
 top
 of


it.
 All
 of
 that
 is
 fantastic.


>> And
 Alex,
 do
 you
 feel
 like
 uh
 any


outcomes
 for
 the
 end
 of
 this
 week?
 I


know
 I
 know
 you're
 heading,
 you
 know,
 to


Asia
 right
 after
 this.
 Do
 you
 feel
 like


there
 could
 be
 a
 more
 positive
 outcome


from
 the
 trade
 talks
 because
 it
 seems


like
 the
 market's
 perceiving
 that
 all
 of


the
 CEOs
 I've
 spoken
 to
 at
 this
 event


too
 are
 very
 very
 bullish
 that
 uh
 there


might
 be
 some
 good
 news.
 So
 maybe
 you


guys
 both
 know
 something
 that
 we
 don't


that
 you
 could
 share


>> and
 we're
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 right
 now.


Um
 look
 that
 I
 I
 look
 I
 don't
 want
 to


just
 make
 this
 about
 our
 partnership
 but


it
 like
 if
 you
 already
 have
 a
 dominant


position
 a
 profitable
 position
 a


position
 that
 is
 growing
 in
 both
 cases


in
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 way
 that
 is
 not
 what


people
 have
 seen
 in
 the
 past
 and
 you


somehow
 create
 more
 value
 for
 your


customers
 that
 is
 incredible
 for
 our


customers
 it's
 incredible
 for
 our


country
 and
 it's
 not
 so
 bad
 for
 us
 and


Palanteer
 on
 Palunteer
 is
 the
 most


technically
 deep
 enterprise
 platform


form
 company
 in
 the
 world
 and
 this


collaboration
 is
 just
 going
 to


supercharge
 that


>> and
 I
 I
 will
 end
 it
 but
 I
 just
 I
 did
 ask


about
 China
 so
 is
 there
 any
 way
 that
 is


do
 you
 believe
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 be


getting
 for
 licenses
 or


>> well
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


important
 the
 important
 thing
 to
 take


away
 is
 that
 that
 we
 need
 to
 win


developers
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 there


are
 so
 many
 open
 source
 developers
 in


China
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 mistake
 not


to
 have
 them
 build
 on
 American
 tech
 so


that's
 number
 one
 number
 two
 we
 all


agree
 um
 that
 that
 we
 want
 America
 to


win
 the
 only
 questions
 what's
 our


strategy
 in
 doing
 so
 and
 and
 one
 of
 one


of
 the
 best
 frameworks
 that
 I
 I
 uh
 I've


heard
 uh
 is
 is
 David
 Saxs
 talking
 about


imagine
 five
 years
 from
 now
 where
 do
 we


want
 suppose
 American
 technology
 was


around
 the
 world
 where
 do
 we
 want


American
 technology
 market
 share
 to
 be


do
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 80%
 or
 you
 want
 it


to
 be
 20%.
 and
 and
 he
 believes
 and
 I
 as


I
 believe
 that
 that
 um
 uh
 we
 want
 the


world
 to
 be
 built
 on
 American
 tech


standards.
 We
 want
 the
 same
 thing
 that


happened
 in
 the
 in
 the
 good
 old
 days


when
 when
 we
 first
 started
 wireless


technology
 and
 it's
 no
 longer
 built
 on


American
 standards
 and
 we
 really
 want
 to


go
 back
 to
 those
 days
 and
 AI
 is
 ours
 to


lose
 just
 as
 Alex
 was
 talking
 about


earlier.
 We
 have
 the
 chips,
 we
 have
 the


infrastructure,
 we
 have
 the
 technology,


we
 have
 the
 models,
 we
 have
 the
 people.


This
 is
 ours
 and
 we
 have
 and
 we
 will


have
 the
 power.
 that
 this
 is
 ours
 to


lose
 and
 we
 just
 got
 to
 get
 on
 top
 of
 it


and
 make
 it
 happen.


>> And
 you
 believe
 that
 that
 is
 going
 to


happen
 that
 the
 tides
 are
 changing
 and


the
 relationships
 with
 other
 countries


are
 working
 out
 quite
 well
 including


China
 and
 so
 is
 that
 something
 that


you're
 telling
 me
 right
 now?


>> That's
 only
 that's
 something
 that
 only


the
 president
 could
 solve
 and
 and
 um
 if


there's
 anybody
 who
 could
 solve
 it,
 I'm


I'm
 certain
 the
 president
 will
 be
 the


one
 to
 do
 it.


>> We're
 just
 building
 technology.


>> Yeah,


>> we're
 building
 technology.
 We
 want
 to
 be


in
 the
 strongest
 position
 we
 can
 be
 in


and
 we
 will
 we're
 repped
 by
 a
 president


who
 seems
 to
 be
 extraordinarily
 good
 at


figuring
 out
 to
 make
 deals.
 You
 saw
 the


peace
 treaty
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 which
 I


don't
 think
 anyone
 else
 could
 have
 done.


Uh
 you've
 seen
 that
 you
 saw
 in
 my
 humble


opinion
 you
 see
 what
 hap
 what
 his


reactions
 abroad
 including
 his
 uh


sanctioning
 of
 our
 uh
 response
 to
 Iran.


Uh,
 and
 we're,
 you
 know,
 we're
 in
 the


factory
 building
 the
 best
 tools
 in
 the


world
 and
 that
 should
 give
 everyone.


>> And
 the
 important
 thing
 is
 is
 China
 is


out
 of
 Nvidia's
 forecast.
 If
 anything


happens,


>> you
 said
 zero,
 right?


>> At
 zero.
 And
 if
 if
 the
 president
 pulls


pulls
 out
 a
 miracle
 and
 it'll
 just
 be
 a


bonus
 for
 the
 country.


>> All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Jensen
 and
 Karp


was
 pretty
 incredible
 to
 see.
 To
 break


that
 down
 and
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 what


happened
 at
 GTC,


we
 got
 to
 get
 the
 most
 important
 Nvidia


analyst
 that
 I
 think
 quite
 frankly


exists
 on
 the
 entire
 planet.
 Ladies
 and


gentlemen,
 Jose,
 what
 a
 day
 for
 you.


>> Yeah,
 definitely.
 It's
 been
 pretty


exciting
 uh
 day
 and
 but
 but
 first,
 happy


birthday
 yesterday.
 I
 texted
 you,
 but


still,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 happy
 birthday


one
 more
 time.
 Um
 hope
 everything
 was


good.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 back
 to
 this
 Nvidia


stuff.


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 appreciate
 that.
 Second


of
 all,
 so
 on
 Zillow,
 I
 just
 want
 to


know
 your
 search
 history
 today.
 Like,


was
 it
 Hawaii?
 Was
 it,
 you
 know,
 Turks


and
 Caos?
 Like,
 where
 exactly
 were
 you


searching
 on
 Zillow
 after
 you
 saw
 me?


>> Definitely
 not
 searching
 on
 Zillow,
 but


it
 it
 is
 funny.
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 at


some
 hotels
 in
 Hawaii.
 Um,
 so
 the
 wife


and
 I
 can
 go
 for
 uh
 for
 well,
 with
 the


little
 one,
 right?
 The
 wife
 and
 I,


little
 one
 go
 for
 a
 nice
 vacation
 uh


this
 year.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 start
 off


with
 this
 question
 before
 we
 get
 into


GCC.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 the
 stock
 hit


all-time
 highs
 today?


>> Uh,
 I
 mean,
 easily,
 easily
 that
 number


they
 gave
 with
 the
 Reuben
 and
 uh,


Blackwell
 numbers
 of
 uh,
 half
 a
 trillion


visibility.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 still
 I'm
 going


to
 rewatch
 um,
 the
 keynote
 because
 these


keynotes,
 we
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 things.


Um
 but
 to
 digest
 them
 and
 to
 kind
 of
 put


them
 in
 perspective
 of
 what
 kind
 of


total
 addressable
 market
 they
 can
 hit.


Um
 it
 takes
 some
 time
 for
 me.
 Uh
 maybe


for
 others
 it's
 an
 immediate
 hit,
 but


for
 me
 it
 takes
 some
 time.
 But
 this
 $500


billion
 figure
 from
 the
 keynote
 was
 the


most
 important
 thing
 um
 in
 my
 opinion


that
 really
 dropped
 jumped
 the
 stock.
 It


shows
 that
 analysts
 are
 still
 very
 under


estimating
 what
 this
 can
 do
 in
 forms
 of


AI
 chips
 and
 this
 is
 visibility.
 Uh
 this


to
 me
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 every
 time
 I
 come


here
 I
 say
 I'm
 not
 bullish
 enough.
 And


reasons
 like
 this
 this
 continues
 to
 show


me
 that
 I'm
 not
 bullish
 enough
 in
 the
 AI


market.


Yeah.
 I
 mean
 dude
 200
 I
 think
 we
 all


knew
 it
 was
 eventually
 coming
 but
 for
 it


to
 come
 in
 such
 a
 uh
 for
 for
 for
 the


velocity
 of
 the
 move
 to
 happen
 the
 way


it
 did
 based
 on
 the
 announcements
 that


were
 announced
 I
 think
 was
 really


incredible
 to
 see.
 And
 then
 obviously


that
 $500
 billion
 number
 was
 also
 very


important.
 So,
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual


announcements
 at
 GTC,
 you
 got
 a
 bunch
 of


stuff
 with
 the
 Department
 of
 Energy,


Uber,
 Palunteer,
 uh,
 all
 of
 these


broader
 data
 center
 companies.
 I
 mean,


what
 do
 you
 think
 he
 said
 besides
 the


500
 billion
 from
 an
 actual
 technical


standpoint
 that
 got
 the
 street
 to
 also


think
 this
 was
 one
 of
 those
 GTCs
 that


really
 does
 matter
 for
 analysts
 to
 care


about?


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 coming
 into
 this


GTC
 DC,
 um,
 I
 was
 I
 wasn't
 expecting


much
 if
 I
 may
 be
 honest
 because
 we


already
 had
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 main
 GTC
 in


March.
 Um,
 so
 I
 thought
 we
 were
 going
 to


get
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 refresh
 rehash,
 but
 I


was
 completely
 wrong.
 This
 was
 probably


one
 of
 my
 favorite
 GTC's
 in
 the
 wild.


Um,
 maybe
 because
 I
 was
 coming
 with
 low


expectations
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 uh
 uh
 blew


it
 out
 the
 waters.
 Uh,
 some
 interesting


things
 that
 I
 uh
 I
 found
 I
 have
 my
 notes


here.
 So
 obviously
 the
 number
 one
 was


like
 that
 revenue
 number.
 I
 think
 that


was
 crucial.
 Uh
 the
 second
 thing
 I
 would


say
 is
 they
 they
 announced
 some
 massive


supercomputer
 wins
 with
 the
 United


States
 governments
 or
 US
 agencies
 uh
 for


again
 I
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 press


release
 to
 kind
 of
 get
 more
 breakdown
 of


what's
 the
 time
 frame
 how
 many
 are
 going


to
 show
 up
 and
 when
 they're
 going to


show
 up
 but
 seven
 supercomputers
 is


pretty
 amazing.
 I
 saw
 some
 crazy
 100,000


blackwell
 GPUs
 in
 some
 of
 them.
 Uh
 so


the
 demand
 there
 is
 wild.
 Um
 the
 third


thing
 that
 I
 found
 pretty
 interesting


and
 it's
 they
 announced
 what
 called
 what


is
 called
 NVQ
 link.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 the


ability
 uh
 to
 kind
 of
 connect
 GPUs
 and
 Q


QPUs
 QPUs.
 Uh
 I
 don't know
 why
 am
 I


saying
 my
 Q's
 weird
 right
 now?
 Whatever.


Um
 but
 um
 is
 to
 connect
 these
 two
 types


of
 products
 uniquely
 with
 a
 special
 type


of
 connection
 Nvidia
 has
 done.
 And
 this


is
 what
 actually
 has
 made
 Nvidia
 kind
 of


like
 a
 core
 component
 or
 the
 main
 player


in
 the
 AI
 space
 is
 their
 envy
 link.
 The


envy
 link,
 the
 ability
 to
 connect
 a
 GPU


and
 a
 CPU
 together
 where
 they
 can


communicate
 almost
 like
 if
 they
 were
 the


same
 chip
 is
 the
 greatest
 strength
 that


I
 think
 many
 people
 don't
 know
 about.


This
 is
 the
 greatest
 strength.
 This
 is


the
 ability
 that
 Nvidia
 has
 to
 create


that
 NVL72.


If
 the
 NVQ
 link
 is
 something
 similar
 for


the
 quantum
 space,
 I
 think
 this
 could
 if


that
 market
 picks
 up
 and
 becomes
 a


massive
 revenue
 opportunity
 that
 creates


that
 moat
 there.
 So
 that
 one
 was
 pretty


interesting.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 those
 were


the


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 spent
 on


quantum
 has
 it
 changed
 your
 perspective


on
 the
 industry?
 Do
 you
 like
 why
 do
 you


think
 Jensen
 really
 focused
 on
 it
 at


this
 GTC?


has
 it
 changed
 my
 perspective
 in
 the


industry.
 First,
 my
 original
 perspective


is
 it's
 not
 investable
 for
 me
 and
 I


still
 believe
 that's
 still
 the
 case
 for


me.
 Um,
 it's
 still
 not
 investable
 for
 me


as
 while
 you
 have


companies
 that
 already
 have
 production


made
 products
 um
 and
 and
 have
 customers.


I
 think
 to
 kind
 of
 get
 to
 the


billion-dollar
 revenue
 streams
 that
 I


like
 to
 look
 at
 for
 for
 massive
 growth


opportunities
 are
 not
 there
 uh
 for
 the


vast
 industry
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 maybe


in
 the
 long
 term.
 Overall
 though,
 it


does
 seem
 like
 all
 these
 players
 are


trying
 to
 get
 into
 the
 space
 and
 I
 think


that's
 an
 indication
 that
 it
 might
 be
 a


lot
 closer
 than
 what
 maybe
 I
 might
 have


thought
 and
 what
 others
 might
 have


think.
 Um,
 but


>> do
 you
 think
 do
 you
 think
 Jensen
 sees
 it


as
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar
 opportunity?


Because
 you
 spent
 a
 good
 amount
 of
 time


talking
 about
 it
 today.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 way
 he's
 doing
 it
 is
 more


through
 the
 hybrid
 approach,
 right?
 That


hybrid
 approach
 of
 using
 classical
 and


accelerated
 computing
 to
 help
 determine


a
 lot
 of
 the


error
 solutions
 in
 in
 in
 quantum.
 Um
 so


I
 think
 that's
 the
 way
 he's
 going
 to


play
 it
 out
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 great


way
 of
 like
 hey
 look
 if
 this
 picks
 up


you
 can
 use
 our
 chips.
 If
 it
 doesn't


pick
 up
 that's
 great.
 We're
 I
 think
 it's


the
 best
 hedge
 for
 them.
 If
 it
 goes
 up,


it
 allows
 them
 to
 have
 a
 massive


opportunity.
 If
 it
 doesn't
 go
 anywhere,


they
 pretty
 much
 just
 focus
 on
 the
 R&D


on
 that
 connectivity
 solution
 aspect.


Um,
 now
 for
 me,
 for
 him
 to
 really


believe
 this
 is
 the
 next
 stage,
 I
 would


expect
 more
 than
 just
 a
 connection
 or
 or


some
 form
 of
 bridge
 between
 them,
 I


would
 expect
 him
 to
 more
 focus
 on
 a


firsthand
 solution.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 see
 this
 as


more
 Jensen
 kind
 of
 hedging
 his
 bets
 in


quantum.
 If
 it
 goes
 somewhere,
 look,


we're
 right
 here.
 We
 have
 Aruda
 Q
 which


is
 our
 kind
 of
 software
 acceleration


applications
 and
 we
 have
 this
 NVQ
 that


if
 maybe
 you
 are
 this
 great
 quantum


computer
 company
 that
 develops
 some


great
 uh
 cubit
 chips
 um
 you're
 going
 to


connect
 them
 to
 our
 AI
 chips
 right


you're
 going to
 have
 the
 ability
 to


connect
 them
 with
 us
 and
 now
 we're
 part


of
 the
 package
 whatever
 you
 sell
 we
 sell


as
 well
 because
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 sell
 these
 supercomputers
 these


quantum
 computers
 with
 our
 hybrid


computers
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 uh


it's
 good
 if
 it
 goes
 good
 and
 even
 if
 it


doesn't
 go
 good.
 We
 didn't
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 money
 in
 it,


>> right?
 So,
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 into
 the


industry
 if
 it
 becomes
 something
 super


massive.
 Wants
 to
 be
 prepared
 for
 it


with
 this
 hybrid
 approach
 and
 you
 know


probably
 can't
 ignore
 that
 technology


which
 is
 why
 they
 spent
 the
 time
 to
 to


discuss
 it
 today.
 Um
 and
 if
 I
 may
 say
 a


lot
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Nvidia
 does


release,
 it
 takes
 time
 right
 for
 example


CUDA
 uh
 came
 out
 I
 believe
 in
 2012
 and


it
 only
 really
 became
 possible
 and


really
 kind
 of
 created
 that
 mo
 um


recently
 right
 uh
 envy
 link
 similar


right
 link
 is
 more
 than
 uh
 few
 years
 old


but
 it
 really
 kind
 of
 shined
 recently.


So
 even
 if
 you
 hear
 them
 working
 on
 this


it
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 going
 to
 shine


right
 away
 but
 it
 gives
 them
 that


opportunity
 to
 when
 it
 does.


>> Agreed.
 What
 did
 you
 think
 about
 the


Uber
 partnership?
 I
 feel
 like
 we've


heard
 Nvidia
 partner
 with
 Uber
 for
 the


past
 three
 four
 years
 and
 nothing
 comes


from
 it.
 Uh
 do
 you
 think
 this
 one
 was
 a


bit
 different?


>> Yeah,
 so
 it
 it's
 I
 feel
 like
 he
 didn't


explain
 it
 as
 well
 as
 maybe
 in
 the
 press


release.
 Um
 so
 there
 have
 been
 various


amount
 of
 Uber
 partnerships.
 The
 one
 we


heard
 about
 earlier
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 was
 was
 it
 this
 week
 or
 last
 week


we
 heard
 one
 as
 well
 where
 it
 was
 just


Uber
 kind
 of
 sharing
 data
 and
 I
 thought


that
 was
 it.
 They
 have
 a
 nice
 white


paper
 on
 it
 that
 showcases
 a
 lot
 of
 the


information
 and
 data
 that
 they
 are


collecting
 and
 now
 it
 helps
 them
 train


their
 form
 of
 AI
 models.
 Now,
 this
 one


is
 I
 think
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 potential


and
 being
 something
 because
 you're


actually
 creating
 a
 form
 of
 an


autonomous
 vehicle
 fleet
 with
 I
 forget


what
 company
 it
 is.
 Is
 it
 the
 Stalantis?


I
 forget
 what
 was
 the
 company.
 Oh,


regardless,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 first


partnerships
 where
 you
 actually
 see
 a


form
 of
 physical
 product
 being
 discussed


in
 the
 press
 release.
 Normally,
 in
 the


past
 few
 weeks,
 in
 the
 past
 few
 months,


we've
 heard
 of
 a
 Uber
 partnership.
 It's


more
 about
 data
 control,
 right?
 It's


more
 about
 data
 transfer
 and
 kind
 of


information
 sharing.
 I
 think
 this
 goes
 a


little
 bit
 above
 that.
 So,
 there
 is
 some


I
 I
 think
 some
 some
 bullish
 scenarios


with
 that
 one
 as
 well.


So
 Jensen
 said
 there's
 a
 $500
 billion


opportunity
 with
 Blackwell
 and
 Ruben
 GPU


over
 the
 next
 five
 quarters.
 Hopper


shipped
 four
 million
 GPUs.
 Blackwell


Rubin
 has
 already
 shipped
 6
 million
 with


the
 total
 demand
 tracked
 at
 20
 million


units.
 All
 of
 that
 doesn't
 seem
 bearish


for
 the
 data
 center
 plays,
 but
 your


Nebius,
 your
 Cororeweave,
 your
 Iran,
 all


of
 them
 took
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 beating
 by
 the


end
 of the
 day.
 And
 again,
 it's
 a
 bit


subjective
 since
 those
 stocks
 are
 up
 a


lot
 this
 year.
 But
 any
 any
 thoughts
 on


why
 the
 data
 center
 stocks
 got
 hit


today?
 I
 I
 was
 my
 biggest
 thing
 is
 maybe


the
 market
 was
 expecting
 actual
 direct


partnerships
 with
 some
 of
 these
 during


GTC
 events
 and
 they
 didn't
 get
 that


partnership
 announcement.
 Regardless,
 I


agree
 with
 your
 first
 sentiment
 that


this
 is
 extremely
 extremely
 bullish
 for


the
 cloud
 players.
 I
 like
 I
 mentioned


I'm
 not
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 sometimes
 I'm
 not


bullish
 enough
 to
 me,
 right?
 Reuben
 is


coming
 out
 in
 2026.
 So
 if
 there's


visibility
 for
 Reuben
 in
 2026,
 those


data
 centers
 are
 going
 to
 run
 for
 five


plus
 years
 even
 longer,
 right?
 But
 just


on
 the
 Reuben
 chip,
 you
 would
 expect
 at


least
 five
 years.
 So
 right
 now,
 if
 you


have
 this
 crazy
 demand
 of
 chips
 and
 and


let's
 just
 go
 back
 to
 thinking
 about
 it,


right?
 Hopper
 was
 just
 came
 out
 and
 just


with
 the
 Hopper
 and
 the
 little
 bit
 of


Blackwell
 that
 we
 have,
 we're
 already


data
 center
 constraint
 and
 power


constraint.
 Now
 you're
 telling
 me
 you're


going
 to
 send
 you
 still
 have
 to
 shell


about
 14
 million
 more
 GPUs.


Where
 are
 you
 going
 to
 get
 that
 power?


Where
 are
 you
 going
 to
 get
 that


infrastructure?
 So


again,
 I'm
 not
 bullish
 enough,
 but
 it


gets
 me
 extremely
 bullish
 for
 these
 AI


cloud
 players
 either
 being
 your


coreweave,
 your
 Nebas,
 your
 iron
 or


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 own.
 The
 market
 is


there.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 stock
 is


going
 to
 go
 up
 straight
 every
 day,


right?
 Massive
 volatility.
 You
 just


mentioned
 it,
 right?
 Some
 of
 these
 had
 a


crazy
 runup.


Any
 pull
 down,
 I
 think
 I'm
 pretty


excited
 about
 them.
 I
 think
 we
 both
 did


the
 same
 play
 with
 Nebulous
 last
 week.


We
 both
 sold
 puts.


>> Yeah,


>> those
 are
 those
 puts
 were
 just
 going
 to


get
 the
 premium
 out
 of
 them.
 Now,
 if
 we


see
 dips
 like
 that,
 it's
 going
 for
 me,


it's
 going to
 be
 a
 mixture
 of
 puts
 and


buying
 shares
 from
 now
 on
 just
 because


it
 does
 that
 that
 was
 just
 a
 great


indication
 that
 it's
 a
 healthy
 market


for
 the
 uh
 hypers
 scale
 and
 those
 that


are
 building
 the
 AI
 infrastructure


space.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 now
 like
 we
 could


possibly
 see
 those
 prices
 again,
 but
 it


would
 have
 to
 create
 a
 little bit
 of
 a


shock
 in
 the
 system
 for
 the
 street
 to


feel
 worried
 about
 data
 center
 spend,


but
 based
 on
 what
 Jensen
 said
 today,


based
 on
 some
 of the
 Morgan
 Stanley


estimates,
 based
 on
 what
 we're
 going
 to


hear
 from
 the
 hyperscalers
 tomorrow,


which
 by
 the
 way
 guys,
 Jose's
 YouTube


right
 there,
 he
 will
 be
 covering
 all
 the


tech
 earnings
 with
 me,
 so
 you
 can


subscribe
 to
 his
 channel
 as
 well,
 and


we'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 close.
 Um,


all
 of
 that
 should
 give
 some
 pretty
 good


guidance
 for
 the
 data
 center
 place.
 In


terms
 of
 Google,
 Microsoft
 and
 Meta
 in


general
 as
 a
 semiconductor
 investor,
 are


are
 you
 looking
 for
 something
 very


specific
 from
 those
 three
 companies
 to


to
 report
 tomorrow?


>> Um,
 from
 tomorrow
 at le
 well
 and
 then
 we


have
 Amazon
 on
 Thursday.
 Two
 out
 of
 the


four
 I'm
 expecting
 to
 increase
 capital


expenditure
 um
 tomorrow
 or
 or
 by
 between


tomorrow
 and
 Thursday,
 right?
 So
 out
 of


those
 four
 players
 out
 of
 Meta,
 out
 of


Google,
 out
 of
 Microsoft
 and
 Amazon,


whatever
 was
 said
 today,
 I
 believe
 at


least
 two
 of
 those
 four
 can
 increase


capex
 um
 or
 make
 some
 nice
 announcements


of
 capex
 growth
 in
 this
 earnings.
 Uh


especially
 right,
 OpenAI
 and
 Microsoft


just
 made
 that
 deal
 where
 um
 OpenAI
 is


going
 to
 buy
 $250
 billion
 worth
 of


compute
 uh
 for
 Azure.
 Where
 are
 they


going
 to
 get
 that?
 They're
 going
 to
 get


that
 either
 by
 building
 their
 own,
 by


working
 with
 Core
 Weave,
 by
 working
 with


Nebas
 as
 they
 both
 have
 as
 Microsoft
 has


contracts
 with
 both
 or
 maybe
 who
 knows


maybe
 some
 other
 player
 that
 they
 want


to
 continue
 to
 diversify
 um
 into
 right


so
 um
 I
 expect
 two
 out
 of
 the
 four
 to


increase
 capex
 and
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


listening
 to
 is


AI
 cloud
 demand.
 what's
 the
 balance
 like


and
 Microsoft
 historically
 every


earnings
 tries
 to
 tell
 us
 hey
 look
 next


quarter
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 see
 a


balance
 in
 supply
 and
 demand
 and
 then


they
 come
 up
 that
 quarter
 and
 say
 you


know
 what
 we're
 actually
 not
 there
 and


we
 don't
 expect
 to
 be
 there
 I
 want
 to


hear
 that
 same
 commentary
 from
 all
 these


players
 um
 this
 week


>> yeah
 because
 if
 they
 can
 say
 that
 we


have
 to
 either
 increase
 our
 capex


guidance
 or
 we
 don't
 have
 enough
 supply


uh
 indicating
 that
 demand
 is


outstripping
 that
 supply
 I
 mean
 that's


bullish
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 data


center
 plays
 as
 you
 said,
 uh,
 do
 you


think
 Microsoft
 solidifying
 their


basically
 30%
 stake
 in
 OpenAI
 is
 good


clarity
 for
 the
 industry
 that
 just


didn't
 know
 what
 Microsoft's
 role
 is
 in


in
 this
 OpenAI
 partnership?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 also
 clears
 up
 the
 kind


of
 questions
 of
 how
 OpenAI
 can
 do


compute
 and
 how
 it
 can
 kind
 of
 um
 work


with
 other
 players
 because
 now
 Microsoft


no
 longer
 has
 the
 first
 the
 right
 to


first
 refusal.
 Uh
 so
 before
 open
 AI
 used


to
 go
 to
 Microsoft
 and
 say
 look


Microsoft
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 to
 Coreweave


they're
 I'm
 paying
 this
 type
 of
 price.


Can
 you
 match
 it?
 If
 you
 can't
 match
 the


price
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 with
 them.
 Um
 now


they
 don't
 even
 have
 to
 go
 to
 to


Microsoft
 anymore.
 They
 can
 just
 work


with
 whoever
 in
 the
 return
 they
 got
 that


at least
 that
 $250
 billion
 incremental.


We
 don't
 know
 how
 long
 that
 time
 frame


is.
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 they
 told
 us.
 I


don't
 know if
 it's
 still
 2030
 or
 to


2032.
 Those
 are
 the
 two
 years
 that
 been


thrown
 around
 in
 that
 in
 that


presentation.
 Um,
 but
 to
 me
 it
 opens
 up


the
 opportunity
 for
 Open
 AI
 to
 make
 a


lot
 more
 partners
 outside
 of
 Core
 Wee,


outside
 of
 Oracle
 to
 kind
 of
 increase


compute
 demands.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


actually
 pretty
 exciting
 for
 the
 overall


space.


>> Do
 do
 you
 have
 any
 uh
 any
 any
 thesis
 on


this?
 Uh
 once
 AGI
 is
 declared
 by
 OpenAI,


that
 declaration
 will
 now
 be
 verified
 by


an
 independent
 expert
 panel.
 What
 are


they
 talking
 about
 here?
 How
 could
 this


even
 be
 in
 legal
 writing?
 What
 do
 you


think
 that
 means?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 because
 right,


OpenAI,
 I
 think
 if
 once
 they
 hit
 AGI,


they
 could
 have
 taken
 away
 all
 the
 IPs


and
 everything
 away
 from
 Microsoft.
 But


that's
 when
 Open
 AI
 was
 to
 decide,
 I've


created
 AGI.
 And
 you
 were
 like,
 how
 can


I
 question
 you?
 Now
 when
 opened
 AI


decides
 hey
 I've
 created
 AGI
 Microsoft


and
 I
 guess
 both
 of
 them
 create
 this


panel
 that
 are
 going
 to
 finally
 decide


is
 this
 AGI
 or
 not.
 Uh
 so
 now
 it's
 no


longer
 in
 one
 person's
 uh
 in
 one
 group's


um
 court
 now
 the
 whole
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


leveling
 field
 there.
 Uh
 but
 I
 agree
 I
 I


don't
 I
 they
 have
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 first


define
 it
 because
 how
 can
 you
 have
 a


panel
 without
 a
 a
 definition
 right?
 It's


like
 going
 to
 to
 a
 court
 without
 the
 the


rule
 of
 the
 law.
 Um,
 you
 need
 to
 have


that
 rule
 for
 you
 to
 have
 the
 jury
 and


the
 lawyers
 and
 everybody
 else
 be
 able


to
 make
 the
 claim
 of
 what
 and
 what
 it's


not.
 Um,
 so
 I
 wonder
 if
 they're
 ever


going
 to
 share
 what
 that
 definition
 is.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Well,
 uh,
 Nvidia's
 pumping


after
 hours
 as
 well.
 20360.


>> Let's
 go.
 That's
 crazy.
 6%
 on
 a
 four


trillion
 four
 plus
 trillion
 dollar


company.
 Um,
 do
 you
 know
 the
 price
 we


need
 to
 be
 five
 trillion?


>> I
 think
 it's
 204.
 We're
 at
 4.95
 trillion


right
 now.
 We
 need
 204.


>> Yeah,
 we
 need
 like
 50
 cents
 to
 get


there.


>> Um,
 absolutely
 incredible
 stuff,
 folks.


Uh,
 this
 is
 Jose's
 newsletter.
 I'm


putting
 it
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 What


the
 chip
 happened.com.
 I
 literally
 got


an
 update
 yesterday
 and,
 uh,
 he
 was


talking
 about
 Amcor.
 So,


>> yeah,
 Amcore.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 you


your
 people
 were
 mentioning
 it
 became
 a


little
 bit
 popular,
 so
 I
 decided
 to


cover
 that
 one.
 Um
 and
 and
 this
 week
 is


even
 though
 it's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


semiconductors
 this
 week,
 we
 do
 have
 a


lot
 of
 big
 tech
 players
 that
 are
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 um
 dictate
 at
 least
 how


the
 spending
 is
 going
 to
 go
 within
 the


AI
 and
 chip
 market.
 Uh
 so
 so
 appreciate


that.


>> Uh
 I
 I
 just
 like
 two
 more
 questions
 for


you,
 Jose,
 but
 real
 quick,
 I
 I I
 have


noticed
 that
 you
 have
 a
 paid
 tier
 to


this
 now.
 So
 just
 want
 to
 give
 you
 the


floor
 to
 give
 a
 little bit
 of a
 pitch
 on


this.
 What
 do
 people
 get
 if
 they
 were
 to


enter
 the
 community?
 I
 think
 it's
 like


50
 bucks
 a
 year
 for
 this
 newsletter.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 it's
 pretty
 new.
 I
 mean,


a
 lot
 of
 noise
 in
 this
 space
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 create
 a
 community
 of


like-minded
 investors.
 In
 that


community,
 I
 have
 a
 room
 where
 we
 can


all
 discuss.
 I've
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 great


analysis
 and
 just
 a
 great
 way
 to
 kind
 of


keep
 away
 from
 the
 noise
 impacting
 the


overall
 AI
 market
 because
 every
 other


day
 you
 hear
 of
 some
 bearish
 thesis,


some
 bearish
 stuff.
 So,
 if
 you're


interesting
 about
 the
 semiconductor


market,
 if
 you're
 interesting
 about
 the


AI
 space,
 this
 is
 a
 great
 community.
 Um,


and
 I
 created
 different
 tiers
 there
 for


for
 all
 price
 points.
 But,
 um,
 I
 I


follow
 the
 space
 like
 no
 tomorrow,
 man.


So,
 to
 me,
 I
 I
 I
 honestly
 believe
 I'm


providing
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 um,
 for
 a
 great


price.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 honestly,
 getting
 getting


the
 signal
 via
 the
 noise
 is
 very


important.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 on
 Twitter,
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 on


YouTube,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be in
 a


centralized
 spot,
 which
 is
 how
 I'm


hearing
 this
 described,
 I
 think
 that


definitely
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 right


there.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 his


newsletter,
 whatthechip.com.
 For
 those


that
 want
 to
 join
 the
 community,
 you
 can


check
 it
 out
 on
 the
 website
 as
 well,
 and


you
 can
 get
 those
 updates
 from
 Jose.
 Uh,


all right.
 Last
 couple
 question
 for
 you,


Jose.
 There
 was
 a
 Skyworks
 acquisition.


Any
 thoughts
 on
 that
 today?


>> Uh,
 if
 that
 happened
 today,
 I
 I
 um
 I
 did


not
 listen
 to
 anything
 else
 except
 the


OpenAI
 Open
 AAI
 and
 Microsoft
 thing
 and


the
 Nvidia
 stuff.
 Um,


>> that
 it's
 been
 pretty
 Yeah,
 it's
 been


pretty
 crazy.
 I
 mean,
 yesterday
 was
 also


pretty
 crazy.
 We
 had
 some
 AMD


announcement
 where
 they
 had
 uh
 two


massive
 supercomputers
 announced
 with


the
 US
 government
 and
 we
 also
 had


Qualcomm
 release
 a
 new
 AI
 chip.
 Uh
 so
 if


anybody
 has
 any
 questions
 on
 those
 two,


I
 also
 wouldn't
 wouldn't
 mind
 covering


that
 either.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 uh
 Intel,
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 a


pretty
 good
 earnings.
 They
 beat
 EPS
 by


2200%.
 And
 I
 know
 you've
 not
 been
 the


biggest
 fan
 of
 it,
 but
 do
 you
 think
 at


all
 it's
 worth
 taking
 a
 gander
 at
 or
 is


Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 just
 a
 better
 opportunity


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 I
 always
 have
 to
 see
 where
 I


would
 want
 to
 put
 my
 money
 and
 I
 don't


want
 to
 buy
 every
 stock.
 I
 as
 a
 US


citizen
 and
 I
 want
 Intel
 to
 succeed


100%.
 This
 is
 a
 company
 that's
 going
 to


uh
 continue
 to
 make
 United
 States
 an


amazing
 and
 strong
 company.
 So,
 I
 want


them
 to
 succeed
 in
 forms
 of
 investment.


Um


the
 turnaround
 story
 is
 just
 getting


started.
 You
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 things.


You
 have
 the
 Nvidia
 partnership.
 Uh
 you


have
 them
 slowing
 down
 capital


expenditure.
 You
 have
 the
 backing
 of
 the


US
 government.
 These
 are
 all
 the
 right


directions
 for
 this
 fun
 company
 to
 make


a
 massive
 turnaround
 story
 in
 the


semiconductor
 space.
 It
 takes
 time.
 It


takes
 time.
 Uh
 so
 if
 you
 are
 an


investor,
 just
 be
 prepared
 for
 a
 for
 a


strong
 ride.
 If
 you
 are
 and
 I'm
 sorry,


I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 this
 back
 to
 AMD.
 you


are
 an
 AMD
 investor,
 I
 think
 those


earnings
 were
 really
 amazing
 for
 AMD


stock
 investors
 because
 they
 mentioned
 a


few
 things.
 They
 mentioned
 that
 the
 CPU


space,
 they're
 still
 their
 supply


constraint
 because
 they're
 working
 on


still
 older
 nodes,
 their
 10
 and
 and


Intel
 10
 and
 Intel
 7.
 I
 believe
 that's


going
 to
 allow
 AMD
 to
 continue
 to
 grab


market
 share
 in
 the
 client
 space.
 And


unfortunately,
 Intel
 during
 the
 earnings


call,
 if
 one's
 listened
 to
 or
 or
 saw
 a


transcript,
 Intel
 actually
 said
 that


they're
 still
 behind
 in
 technology


leadership
 for
 the
 data
 center
 space.


Um,
 and
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 and
 we're


seeing
 all
 these
 massive
 data
 sensors


investment,
 it's
 going
 to
 continue
 to


show
 that
 AMD
 might
 continue
 to
 win
 a


nice
 amount
 of
 CPU
 market
 share
 in
 the


data
 center
 space.
 So,
 pretty
 good
 for


Intel.
 Congratulations.
 Um,
 but,
 um,
 I


think
 this
 is
 extremely
 bullish
 for
 AMD


in
 general.


Uh,
 I
 believe
 20523
 guys
 is
 5
 trillion.


I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 5
 trillion
 yet,


but


let
 me
 know.
 We
 But
 there
 you
 go.
 204


after
 hours.
 Last
 question
 for
 you
 Jose


is
 uh
 this


>> should
 should
 people
 be
 worried
 about


Qualcomm
 uh
 taking
 in
 biddy's
 lunch
 or


>> um
 definitely
 definitely
 not.
 I
 mean


it's
 crazy
 to
 see
 the
 market
 react
 like


that.
 Yesterday
 the
 stock
 was
 up
 roughly


20%.
 Because
 AMD,
 let's
 just
 go
 back
 to


AMD
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 compete
 against


Nvidia
 for
 multiple
 generations
 of
 AI


chips
 and
 they're
 just
 finally
 finally


getting
 mad
 announcements
 with
 big


players,
 right?
 They
 just
 got
 that
 open


AI.
 You're
 going
 to
 tell
 me
 Qualcomm


that
 has
 this
 is
 I
 think
 their
 second


generation.
 There's
 the
 AI
 100
 that
 they


released
 in
 2020.
 didn't
 really
 get
 much


adoption,
 but
 you're
 telling
 me
 that


this
 company
 is
 going
 to
 come
 out
 with


their
 second
 chip
 sometime
 in
 2026
 and


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 market
 eater
 lunch


for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 industry.
 I
 don't


think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 Qualcomm
 is


not
 just
 fighting
 Nvidia.
 It's
 fighting


Nvidia,
 it's
 fighting
 AMD,
 it's
 fighting


Broadcom,
 it's
 fighting
 Marllo,
 it's


fighting
 all
 these
 ASIC
 players,
 it's


fighting
 um
 all
 these
 other
 players
 that


are
 also
 building
 AI
 chips
 that
 um
 are


in
 the
 private
 and
 private
 market
 as


well.
 The
 only
 good
 thing
 I
 would
 say


about
 them
 is
 they
 did
 announce
 a


partnership
 with
 Humane
 that
 they're


going
 to
 make
 uh
 a
 200
 megawatt
 data


center
 uh
 in
 Saudi
 Arabia.
 how
 real
 that


deal
 is.
 We've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 deals
 in


Saudi
 Arabia
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 right


now,
 but
 we
 haven't
 seen
 the
 chips


actually
 getting
 sent
 there.
 Where
 are


you
 in
 their
 tier
 list?
 Like
 if
 you're


that
 company,
 Humane,
 are
 you
 taking


orders
 from
 Nvidia
 first,
 then
 AMD,
 then


the
 other
 players?
 And
 where
 in
 the
 list


is
 Qualcomm
 on
 that
 pay
 sheet?
 Uh
 if
 if


those
 deals
 are
 real.
 Uh
 so
 to
 me,
 not
 a


worried,
 but
 Qualcomm
 outside
 of
 the
 AI


play,
 they
 definitely
 have
 an


opportunity
 with
 Internet
 of
 Things.
 I


just
 wouldn't
 like
 it.
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 buy


Qualcomm
 as
 a
 data
 center
 AI
 company.


>> That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 All
 right,
 there


you
 go,
 Jose.
 200.
 I
 mean,
 it
 looks
 like


he
 wants
 to
 Who's
 buying
 after
 hours,


bro?
 Where's
 this?
 You
 got
 some
 volume


coming
 in.


>> No.
 Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 insane.
 I
 mean,
 I


wonder
 if
 there's
 some
 keynotes


happening
 because
 I
 GTC
 I
 think
 is
 still


going
 on.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 keynotes


happening.
 Um,
 I
 wonder
 if
 some
 things


are
 happening
 during
 the
 event
 right


now.


>> That's
 true.
 There
 are
 a
 bunch
 of


keynotes.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 tons
 of
 people


looking
 at
 different
 presentations
 and


demos
 and
 they
 could
 be
 pulling
 out


their
 phones
 right
 now
 and
 saying,


"Screw
 it.
 I'm
 buying
 more."


There
 you
 go.
 20430.
 All
 right,
 Jose.


Thank
 you.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 five


trillion
 yet,
 guys.
 I
 My
 market
 caps


aren't
 updating
 on
 Legend
 or
 Weeble,
 but


if
 anyone
 has
 it,
 let
 me
 know.
 I
 still


see
 4.97.


That
 is
 wild.
 That's
 crazy.
 This
 was


just
 four
 trillion.
 What?
 Two
 months


ago.
 I
 When
 did
 it
 hit?


>> It's
 wild.


It's
 wild.
 The
 the
 AI
 market
 is
 crazy.
 I


mean,
 yesterday
 I
 I
 I


stood
 on
 my
 I
 I
 sat
 by
 my
 computer
 for


like
 12
 hours
 just
 using
 AI
 to
 help
 me


code
 some
 stuff.
 I
 think
 without
 AI,
 it


would
 have
 taken
 me
 over
 a
 month
 to
 do


what
 I
 did
 yesterday.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


this
 is
 insane.
 If
 I
 who
 sometimes
 like


to
 procrastinate
 a
 lot
 can
 do
 this
 in
 12


hours,
 I
 can't
 imagine
 what
 some
 of


these
 crazy
 people
 are
 doing
 with
 AI


right
 now.


>> Agreed.
 Jose,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Jose's


newsletter,
 what
 the
 chip
 happened,
 and


I
 will
 see
 you
 tomorrow.
 We
 got
 a
 big


day
 tomorrow.


>> All
 right.
 Good
 night
 and
 thank
 you
 to


to
 all
 the
 support.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> Good
 night.
 Later.


>> Yeah,
 guys.
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 have
 I
 don't


have
 anything
 telling
 me
 if
 it's
 5


trillion
 or
 not.
 Some
 of
 you
 guys
 are


saying
 yes.
 Some
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 saying


we
 need
 a
 couple
 more
 bucks.
 208
 I
 think


is
 way
 way way
 past
 5
 trillion.


But
 this
 is
 incredible.


This
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 day.
 Uh
 Steve's


going
 to
 be
 on
 in
 five
 minutes.
 He
 said


he
 wanted
 to
 come
 on.
 So
 we'll
 get
 his


thoughts
 on
 what
 happened
 throughout
 the


day.
 Uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 palry


partnership,
 look,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 thought
 it


was
 quite
 incredible.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 this
 is
 Nvidia's
 models
 being


integrated
 into
 ontology
 and
 AIP.
 I


think
 from
 a
 perception
 standpoint,
 it


was
 very
 important
 to
 see
 Karp
 and


Jensen,
 who
 are
 two
 of
 the
 biggest
 AI


leaders
 of
 our
 lifetime,
 actually
 uh


collaborating
 and
 having
 this


relationship
 together.
 There's
 a
 demo


specifically
 with
 Lowe's
 that
 I
 haven't


seen
 yet,
 but
 Lowe's
 is
 the
 use
 case
 is


the
 company
 with
 the
 use
 case
 that
 has


already
 been
 working
 with
 Palunteer


integrating
 the
 work
 they're
 doing
 with


Nvidia.


And
 it's
 quite
 incredible.


It
 is.
 It
 is
 just
 quite
 incredible
 to


see.
 The
 fact
 that
 we're
 alive
 and
 we


get
 to
 see
 multiple
 multi-
 trillion


dollar
 companies
 in
 our
 lifetime
 be


created.


I
 mean,
 the
 story
 of
 Nvidia
 will
 be
 told


long
 after
 we're
 all
 gone.
 And
 the
 fact


that
 we
 get
 to
 live
 through
 it
 and
 then


have
 a
 chance
 to
 invest
 in
 it
 is
 pretty


cool.
 And
 again,
 even
 if
 you're
 not


investing
 in
 Nvidia,
 if
 you're
 investing


in
 something
 that's
 a
 derivative
 of


Nvidia,
 which
 Nebia's
 core,
 we've
 all


these
 guys
 are
 derivatives
 of
 what's


happening
 with
 Nvidia,
 then
 you
 know,


you
 are
 a
 beneficiary


of
 this
 company
 continuing
 to
 do
 well.


So,
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 We
 already


got
 Visa's
 numbers.
 Let's
 see
 after


hours
 if
 we
 had
 any
 changes.
 Uh,
 Visa


had
 a
 double
 beat.
 Visa
 basically
 flat


after
 hours.
 NFA
 still
 down
 about
 5%.


Bookings
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Seagate
 up
 2%.


And
 Bloom
 Energy
 having
 the
 best
 one
 up


about
 4%.
 Cheesecake
 down.
 They
 did
 have


a
 beat
 and
 a
 miss.
 Co-star
 up
 a
 little


bit
 or
 actually
 Co-Star
 down
 and
 then
 EA


down.
 Mandles
 taking
 a
 bigger
 beating


as
 that
 one
 is
 down
 about
 4%
 as
 well.


Pterodine.
 Oh
 yeah,
 that
 one's
 up.


Pterodine
 is
 up.
 Wow,
 that's
 a
 big
 move


on
 Ter.
 Did
 their
 earnings
 just
 come


out?
 Because
 we
 didn't
 get
 their
 numbers


an
 hour
 ago.
 Maybe
 their
 numbers
 just


came
 out,
 but
 Pterodine,
 that's
 a
 pretty


big
 pump.


You
 got
 Josh.
 Great
 time
 to
 be
 alive.


Josh,
 we
 we
 shared
 your
 portfolio,
 bro.


You're
 you're
 you're
 inching
 towards


that
 10
 millie.
 It's
 going
 to
 happen.


Josh,
 what
 percentage
 of
 the
 port
 is


SoFi?
 I
 I
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 like
 80%.
 But


I
 feel
 like
 maybe
 I'm
 too
 aggressive


there.
 I
 know
 you
 have
 micro
 strategy.
 I


know
 you
 bit
 mine,


but
 I
 feel
 like
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 this


is


is
 SoFi.


So,
 shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 Josh
 right
 there


getting
 some
 love.
 Yeah,
 Job's
 up
 9%


because
 of
 Nvidia
 partnership.
 I
 don't


know
 the
 specifics
 on
 it,
 but
 their
 Evol


is
 collaborating
 with
 Nvidia.
 That's
 why


Job
 is
 getting
 some
 excitement
 right


there
 after
 hours.


And
 you're
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 All


right,
 Pterodine.
 I
 just
 got
 their


numbers.
 Revenue
 of
 769
 million.
 Um,


strong
 AI
 related
 growth
 in
 compute
 and


memory
 expected
 to
 grow
 in
 Q4.
 EPS
 was


75
 cents.
 Yes,


EPS
 a
 little
 bit
 down
 year-over-year.


Revenues
 up
 year-over-year.
 I
 think


still
 a
 double
 beat
 on
 both
 of
 those
 uh


metrics.
 And
 that's
 why
 Pterodine
 is


getting
 the
 pump.


That's
 why
 Pterodine
 is
 getting
 the


pump.


Muckabe
 said,
 "I
 bought
 160
 1121
 calls


before
 the
 close."
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.


You're
 deep
 in
 the
 money.
 170


for
 Pterodine
 172.
 Yeah,
 that
 one's


moving.
 Moving.
 That
 one
 is
 moving.


Pterodine,
 that's
 up
 19%.


That
 is
 up
 19%


as
 well.


Um,


okay.
 I
 mean,
 what
 else
 is
 the
 reaction


that
 everyone
 else
 had
 today?
 I
 think
 it


was
 just
 one
 of
 those
 epic
 days
 where
 we


had
 so
 much
 news
 to
 dissect
 and


understand
 and
 discuss.


I
 mean,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 pretty


remarkable
 day
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 different
 moving
 parts.
 Not
 to


mention,
 we
 got
 the
 rate
 cuts
 or
 the


FOMC
 meeting
 tomorrow.
 So,
 that's
 also


going
 to
 be
 really
 important
 to
 navigate


and
 see
 exactly
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


Uh,
 but
 we
 barely
 got
 to
 talk
 about


China,
 but
 there
 were
 some
 good
 updates


here.
 Here's
 what
 uh
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 reported
 which
 seems
 to
 be


positive
 for
 the
 bulls
 in
 regards
 to


China
 tensions
 easing.


>> Scott,
 yeah,
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 out


with
 some
 reporting
 this
 afternoon
 on


possible
 concessions
 that
 each
 side


might
 make
 if
 the
 US
 and
 China
 do
 come


to
 a
 trade
 deal
 this
 week.
 Now,


officials
 have
 not
 confirmed
 these


details
 to
 CNBC,
 but
 the
 Journal
 reports


that
 the
 US
 would
 roll
 back
 fentinyl


tariffs
 back
 from
 20
 to
 as
 low
 as
 10%
 if


Beijing
 cracks
 down
 on
 exporting


fentinel
 precursor
 ingredients.
 The


paper
 cites
 people
 familiar
 with
 the


talks
 for
 those
 details.
 Now,
 the


meeting
 between
 President
 Trump
 and


Chinese
 leader
 Xiinping
 is
 slated
 for


late
 Wednesday
 evening
 US
 time.
 And
 in


the
 run-up
 to
 that,
 the
 president's
 been


holding
 face-to-face
 meetings
 with


leaders
 of
 Asian
 nations,
 setting
 up


framework
 agreements
 that
 he
 hopes
 are


going
 to
 buttress
 US
 economic


relationships
 in
 the
 region.
 He
 spoke
 to


a
 group
 of
 business
 leaders
 in
 Tokyo


this
 morning
 that
 included
 Apple's
 Tim


Cook,
 SoftBank
 CEO
 Masoshi
 Sun,


Salesforce
 CEO
 Mark
 Beni
 off,
 and


others.
 The
 president
 touted
 a
 number
 of


business
 development
 deals
 and
 said


they're
 going
 to
 benefit
 American


workers.
 Earlier,
 he
 flew
 to
 the


aircraft
 carrier
 USS
 George
 Washington


with
 Japanese
 Prime
 Minister
 Sane


Takichi
 where
 they
 inspected
 American


fighter
 jets
 and
 the
 president
 greeted


American
 troops.
 President
 Trump
 Scott


also
 joking
 on
 this
 trip
 that
 he
 wants


Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Bessant
 to
 take


over
 the
 Federal
 Reserve,
 but
 he
 said


that
 Bessant
 wants
 to
 stay
 at
 Treasury.


He
 did
 not
 tip
 his
 hand
 though
 about
 who


he
 is
 ultimately
 going
 to
 select.
 Scott


Becker.
 So
 the
 reduction
 of
 those
 port


fees
 good
 for
 China.
 Trump
 signaling


some
 announcements
 today
 that
 he
 thinks


he's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 good
 meeting
 with


Gi.
 That
 could
 also
 be
 good
 for
 Nvidia


because
 right
 now
 Nvidia
 is
 pumping


without
 the
 China
 guidance.
 If
 we


actually
 get
 the
 China
 chips
 back,
 that


would
 be
 very
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia.
 And
 so


overall
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 strong
 from
 a


geopolitical
 perspective.


But
 then
 you
 also
 get
 earnings
 like


Caesars's
 folks.
 Caesar's
 down
 9%
 after


hours
 and
 it's
 because
 the
 consumer
 at


least
 in
 Vegas
 not
 doing
 the
 best.
 Same


store
 net
 revenue
 952
 versus
 $9.99.


That's
 a
 miss.
 2.87
 billion
 versus
 2.89.


That's
 a
 miss.
 They
 lost
 27
 cents
 a


share.
 Operating
 income
 at
 513
 million.


Adjusted
 EBA
 at
 8.84.
 The
 street
 thought


they
 would
 come
 in
 at
 940.


CEO
 said,
 "Our
 net
 revenues
 and
 adjusted


EB
 growth
 as
 a
 result
 of
 consistent


operating
 trends
 and
 continued
 positive


returns
 from
 our
 capital
 projects.
 As
 we


look
 to
 the
 fourth
 quarter,
 we


anticipate
 improved
 operating


performance
 given
 stronger
 occupancy
 in


Vegas.
 Volumes
 in
 our
 Caesar's
 digital


segment
 were
 strong
 driven
 by
 continued


product
 improvements
 while
 adjusted
 was


negatively
 impacted."
 Dude,
 you
 know,


Chris
 said
 this
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 and
 I


think
 he's
 right
 about
 this.
 I
 think
 the


prediction
 markets
 are
 taking
 away


market
 share
 from
 from
 the
 from
 the


hotels
 and
 from
 the
 casinos.
 Obviously,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 not


going
 to
 Vegas
 as
 much
 as
 as
 well
 and


that
 that's
 an
 issue.
 But
 and
 then
 you


have
 some
 issues
 with
 Canada
 and
 Vegas


and
 you're
 getting
 a
 lack
 of
 people


traveling,
 but
 if
 people
 can
 just
 gamble


on
 their
 phones,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 it


takes
 away
 the
 need
 or
 the
 necessity
 to


go
 to
 Vegas.
 I
 mean,
 when
 I
 went
 in


September,
 and
 I
 know
 September
 is


usually
 not
 the
 best,
 but
 when
 I
 went


for
 the
 hood
 summit,
 it
 was
 dead.
 It's


completely
 dead.


And
 so
 that
 that
 that's
 sort
 of
 like,


hey,
 let's
 go
 to
 Vegas.
 Let's
 go
 have


fun.
 Let's
 go
 get
 drunk
 and
 get
 a
 bunch


of
 friends
 and
 buddies
 to
 go
 down
 there.


I
 mean,
 now
 people
 might
 just
 be
 doing


that
 as
 a
 group
 with
 their
 phones
 and


they
 have
 their
 prediction
 markets


pulled
 up.


>> Yeah,
 DraftKings,
 too.
 Dude,
 I


I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 I'm
 bearish


DraftKings
 because
 they
 don't
 understand


their
 business.
 I
 just
 think
 the
 fact


that
 they
 had
 to
 Wow.
 down
 5%
 today.
 The


fact
 that
 they
 had
 to
 acquire
 a


prediction
 markets
 platform
 after
 for


the
 past
 couple
 years
 saying
 that


prediction
 markets
 are
 not
 as


sophisticated
 as
 what
 DraftKings
 offers


just
 goes
 to
 show
 that
 consumer
 is


picking
 prediction
 markets.


That's
 what
 people
 love
 to
 bet
 on


and
 it's
 it's
 not
 really
 some
 of
 the


other
 conventional
 things
 that
 people


used
 to
 bet
 on.
 Nvidia,
 wow,
 20370.


We
 hit
 204,
 right?
 Yeah,
 we
 did
 hit


20450.
 So,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle,


but
 still
 holding


above
 that
 200
 level.
 Diana
 says,
 "So


true.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 way
 better


odds
 than
 Vegas.
 People
 should
 just


trade
 for
 fun."
 That's
 also
 true.
 You


have
 a
 lot
 better
 odds
 sometimes
 even


buying
 call
 options
 on
 earnings
 than


than
 gambling
 at
 Vegas.
 The
 hotel
 staff


said
 it
 was
 more
 dead
 than
 usual.
 I


asked
 them,
 "Louey,
 is
 that


that's
 the
 Nvidia
 Louie,
 right?
 Nvidia


Louie,
 is
 that
 you?
 I
 think
 this
 is
 Mr.


Nvidia
 Louie.
 He
 was
 at
 the
 Hood
 Summit.


For
 those
 that
 don't
 know,
 Nvidia
 Louie,


Nvidia
 Louie
 has
 90,000
 shares
 of
 Nvidia


at
 a
 $2
 average.
 So,
 uh,
 this
 this
 has


got
 to
 be
 a
 good
 day
 for
 you.
 This
 has


got
 to
 be
 a
 good
 day
 for
 you.
 12
 bucks


on
 the
 day,


up
 6.33%.


Oh,
 sorry.
 It's
 100,000
 shares.
 My
 bad.


My
 bad.
 It's
 not
 90,000.
 It's
 100,000.


Triple
 V
 has
 100
 I
 think
 he
 has
 150,000


shares,
 but
 he
 bought
 them
 at
 160.


So,
 you
 know,
 today's
 probably
 a
 a
 good


day
 for
 him.
 That's
 wild,
 bro.
 I
 mean,


there's
 not
 many
 names
 that
 take
 you
 on


that
 journey
 where
 you
 buy
 at
 two
 bucks


and
 it
 goes
 to
 200.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 to


really
 stick
 with
 the
 thesis.
 And
 from


the
 conversations
 I've
 had
 with
 Louie,
 I


mean,
 he
 he
 was
 just
 obsessed
 with


Nvidia
 back
 in
 2016.
 And
 he
 told


everyone
 he
 could
 about
 what
 was


happening.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 remarkable.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 remarkable.


Louise
 says
 cost
 bases
 around
 one.
 Wow,


dude.
 And
 and
 Louie,
 I
 know
 you
 don't


sell
 a
 ton
 of
 covered
 calls,
 but
 with


the
 covered
 calls
 you
 have
 sold,
 I
 would


imagine
 if
 you're
 including
 that
 in
 the


cost
 basis,
 it's
 probably
 even
 lower.


It's
 not
 just
 the
 raw
 cost
 basis.


And
 that
 is
 the
 American
 story.
 the


American
 the
 or
 the
 American
 dream
 is


you
 can
 take
 a
 chance
 on
 someone
 else


instead
 of
 you
 know
 you
 being
 the


entrepreneur
 and
 you
 know
 because
 the


country
 allows
 the
 freedom
 to
 to
 go


build


there's
 a
 shot
 you
 can
 build
 uh
 top


growth
 experts
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 100


super
 chat
 amid
 happy
 birthday

yesterday
 man
 appreciate
 everything
 you


do
 hope
 to
 catch
 up
 at
 UK
 meet
 up
 much


love
 to
 you

 Maven
 hoping
 to
 set


up
 that
 UK
 meetup
 soon
 thank
 you
 again


for
 the
 birthday
 wish

 yeah
 excited


to

 UK

2026
 Six.
 Danielle,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 The
 Fed
 plans
 to
 print
 1.5


trillion
 after
 rate
 cuts.
 How
 will
 that


affect
 the
 market?
 So,
 it's
 not
 exactly


that
 they're
 going
 to
 print
 1.5


trillion.
 I
 think
 some
 of
 these
 numbers


are
 coming
 up
 because
 people
 are
 doing


the
 math
 on
 how
 much
 less
 quantitative


tightening
 is
 going
 to
 happen,
 aka
 how


much
 money
 gets
 pumped
 into
 the
 system.


How
 will
 affect
 the
 markets?
 It's
 good.


I
 mean,
 we
 have
 that
 much
 more
 liquidity


and
 money
 becomes
 cheaper,
 assets
 go


higher.
 Like,
 assets
 kind
 of
 are


programmed
 to
 go
 higher.
 Now,
 that


doesn't
 mean
 we
 can't
 have
 a
 recession.


It
 also
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 we
 won't
 end


up
 into
 a
 broader
 asset
 bubble,
 but
 it


does
 mean
 that
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 you're


going
 to
 see
 asset
 prices
 likely
 catch
 a


bid
 if
 you
 have
 so
 much
 money
 that
 is


out
 there.
 The
 question
 is,
 can
 we
 grow


GDP
 enough
 to
 make
 that
 happen?
 And


also,
 the
 question
 on
 inflation
 because


that's
 the
 biggest
 concern
 when
 you
 have


all
 this
 money
 printing.
 I
 mean,
 one


thing
 that
 Jensen
 kind
 of
 made
 clear


today,
 even
 if
 it
 was
 implicitly,
 is


that
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


deflation
 than
 we
 think
 simply
 based
 on


the
 idea
 of
 how
 transformative
 AI
 is


going
 to
 be.
 I
 mean,
 if
 he's
 right
 about


where
 he
 thinks
 the
 market
 really
 is


going
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI,
 we
 are
 going


to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 deflation,
 a
 lot
 of
 cost


of
 goods
 start
 to
 come
 down,
 a
 lot
 of


cost
 of
 labor
 obviously
 come
 down.
 And


that's
 something
 I
 think
 we
 um,


you
 know,
 we
 also
 can't
 ignore.
 Speaking


of
 layoffs,
 I
 mean,
 I
 saw
 this
 today
 and


and


I
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 to
 make
 of
 it


yet.
 I
 haven't
 formed
 an
 opinion
 fully,


but
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 These
 were
 the


recent
 uh
 layoff
 announcements
 we
 had


over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 So,
 UPS
 and


Amazon
 we
 all
 covered.
 UPS
 that
 that
 is


that
 is
 an
 accurate
 headline.
 48,000


30,000
 operational,
 18,000
 corporate.


Amazon
 says
 up
 to
 30,000.
 They
 clarified


it's
 more
 like
 14,000
 in
 corporate.
 Then


you
 have
 Intel
 at
 24,000.
 Nestle
 at


16,000.
 Accenture
 consulting
 firm.
 We


we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 those
 layoffs


at
 11,000.
 Ford
 at
 11,000.
 Novo
 at


9,000.
 Microsoft,
 this
 was
 reported
 a


couple
 months
 ago,
 but
 that's
 still


7,000.
 PWC,
 Salesforce,
 Paramount,


Target,
 Kroger,
 Applied
 Metals,
 and
 then


Meta.
 This
 was
 off
 their
 AI
 division.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 a
 structural


problem
 with
 demand
 in
 the
 economy


creating
 layoffs,
 which
 is
 what
 we
 saw


three
 years
 ago
 in
 22.
 It
 feels
 like


that's
 not
 the
 case
 given
 these
 earnings


beats
 that
 we're
 seeing
 and
 all
 these


CEOs
 and
 banks
 saying
 demand
 is
 fine.
 We


have
 no
 issue.
 the
 consumer's
 fine,
 etc.


It
 feels
 more
 like
 AI
 and
 it
 feels
 more


like
 PWC
 saying
 we
 don't
 need
 some
 of


the
 people
 that
 we
 have.
 Salesforce


saying
 we
 don't
 need
 some
 of
 the
 people


that
 we
 have
 because
 they
 just
 don't


need
 to
 do
 the
 job
 that
 an
 LLM
 could


potentially
 do.
 Uh,
 and
 it
 is
 a
 scary


thing
 to
 think
 about
 because
 you
 don't


want
 to
 see
 anyone
 ever
 lose
 their
 job,


but
 companies
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 are


going
 to
 do
 whatever
 they
 need
 to
 do
 to


increase
 their
 margins.
 And
 cutting


costs
 with
 labor
 is
 one
 of the
 easiest


things
 they
 can
 do.
 if
 they
 have
 a
 very


simple
 replacement
 via
 AI,
 that's


something
 I
 think
 everyone
 has
 to


prepare
 for.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 as
 a


society
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 deal
 with
 it.


I
 really
 don't.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 confusing


in
 a
 variety
 of
 elements
 on
 what


governments
 do,
 but
 nonetheless.
 Rile


says,
 "I
 survived
 this
 round
 of
 Amazon


layoffs.
 Nobody
 from
 my
 team
 slept
 the


whole
 night.
 People
 were
 online
 at
 3:00


to
 4:00
 a.m."
 Okay,
 but
 Rashelle,
 you're


an
 engineer,
 right?


Does
 engineer
 get
 get
 get
 uh


well
 yeah
 engineer
 as
 corporate?
 I
 mean


I
 think
 of
 corporate
 as
 management
 but


engineer
 is
 like
 when
 we're
 talking


about
 white
 collar
 job
 if
 we
 put


engineer
 in
 the
 same
 mix.


Yeah.
 I
 mean
 dude
 if
 they're
 if
 they're


getting
 ready
 to
 lay
 off
 15,000
 people


you
 got
 to
 be
 at
 the
 top
 of
 your
 game
 to


not
 get


to
 not
 get
 hit,
 right?
 Engineers
 are


part
 of
 it.
 Okay.
 So
 then


yeah,
 dude.
 That
 that's
 that's


definitely
 something
 that's
 scary.
 And


again,
 like
 it
 affects
 everyone
 in


society.
 It's
 not
 just
 like,
 oh,
 if
 you


keep
 your
 job
 and
 someone
 else
 loses


their
 job,
 you're
 you're
 safe.
 It's


like,
 yeah,
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 but
 that


person
 is
 also
 contributing
 to
 the


economy.
 And
 if
 they
 don't
 have a
 job


and
 they
 don't
 have
 money
 to
 spend,


that's
 not
 good
 for
 anybody.
 Like
 that,


like
 the
 way
 capitalism
 works
 is
 you


need
 everyone
 being
 productive


and
 contributing.


And
 without
 it,
 things
 can
 uh
 things
 can


get
 hit.
 Louis
 says,
 "I
 live
 in
 the
 same


house
 I
 bought
 in
 2016
 for
 $200,000.


Looking
 to
 move
 soon,
 though
 I'm
 in
 no


rush.
 I
 was
 happy
 then,
 I'm
 happy
 now.


Money
 is
 just
 a
 number.


See,
 that's,
 you
 know,
 look,
 Triple
 V


would
 agree
 with
 you,
 Louie.
 I
 mean,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 number
 on
 the


screen
 is
 not
 necessarily
 the
 path
 to


happiness,
 although
 you're
 looking
 at
 a


pretty
 big
 number
 on
 the
 screen
 now.


Pretty
 big
 number
 on
 the
 screen
 at
 this


point.
 Amazon
 fired
 quietly
 a
 lot
 of


people
 from
 Twitch.
 That
 actually
 I
 feel


like
 is
 very
 believable
 because
 Twitch


is
 just
 not
 a
 platform
 that's
 working


for
 them.
 bought
 it
 for
 a
 billion
 bucks


and
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 monetized
 it
 over


the
 past
 10
 years.
 Bitcoin
 112.5.


So,
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 they'd
 be
 trying


to
 clean
 up
 in
 certain
 areas.
 And
 look,


you
 know,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 for
 shareholders,


if
 they're
 making
 these
 announcements,


they're
 basically
 trying
 to
 tell
 the


market,
 we
 are
 ready
 to
 get
 our
 stock
 to


move
 higher
 and
 we're
 taking
 like
 very


significant
 cost
 cutting
 measures
 to


make
 sure
 it
 happens.


It's
 just
 the
 opposite
 perspective
 on


that
 is
 that
 hey,
 maybe
 the
 business
 is


not
 doing
 so
 well
 and
 you
 have
 to
 cut


these
 costs
 in
 order
 to
 to
 to
 match
 some


of
 the
 metrics
 that
 you
 need
 to
 get
 up


to.
 We're
 going
 to
 find
 out
 on
 Thursday


what
 Amazon
 says,
 but
 it's
 not
 good
 for


anyone.


It
 is
 not
 good
 for
 anyone.
 Amit,
 I
 work


at
 a
 Dow
 30
 company
 and
 they
 recently


offered
 anyone
 with
 more
 than
 10
 years


with
 the
 company
 voluntary
 separation


agreements.
 Wow.


Wow.


When
 he
 means
 Dow
 30,
 he's
 talking
 about


one
 of
 the
 30
 companies
 in
 in
 the
 Dow


Jones.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 layoff
 thing,
 guys,


we
 got
 we
 got
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 it.
 We


got
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 it.
 It
 seems


like
 after
 Amazon
 and
 UPS
 made
 the


announcement,
 we
 started
 seeing
 a
 lot


more
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.
 And


now,
 and
 again,
 a
 lot of
 these
 are


consulting
 firms
 and
 companies
 where


it's
 obvious
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 replace


some
 of these
 employees.


the
 other
 companies
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a


question
 of
 just
 like
 hey
 is
 there
 a


broader
 structural
 issue
 going
 on


defaults
 on
 loans
 are
 going
 up
 see
 like


we
 see
 all
 these
 charts
 about
 defaults


on
 loans
 and
 things
 of
 that
 nature
 but


then
 you
 see
 the
 big
 banks
 come
 out
 and


say
 that
 the
 delinquency
 rates
 are
 lower


than
 expected
 so
 it's
 hard
 to
 kind
 of


match
 up
 exactly
 with
 how
 this
 is


playing
 out


but
 nonetheless
 this
 stuff
 is
 is
 indeed


happening


these
 jobs
 will
 never
 come
 back
 well


that's
 the
 scariest
 part
 about


I
 mean,
 dude,
 like
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 was


in
 high
 school
 and
 I
 had
 little
 projects


or
 not
 high
 school,
 in
 college,
 I
 would


hire
 people
 from
 the
 Philippines
 on


Upwork
 and
 Fiverr
 to
 like
 do
 little


graphic
 designs
 for
 me
 that
 I
 I
 will


never
 have
 to
 do
 that
 ever.


Like
 I
 will
 go
 to
 Chachi
 Pete
 or
 Grock


and
 just
 say,
 "Hey,
 like
 give
 me
 a


picture
 of
 a
 cake."
 And
 like
 I
 you
 know,


like
 I
 I
 never
 have
 to
 ask
 someone
 to
 do


that.
 It's
 like
 that's
 done.


And
 it's
 not
 like
 that
 entire
 industry


is
 wiped
 out.
 But
 the
 average
 person


like
 myself
 signing
 up
 to
 Fiverr
 and


actually
 making
 an
 account
 and
 going


through
 that
 process
 like
 some
 of
 these


jobs
 are
 not
 coming
 back.


They're
 not.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 implications


that
 will
 have
 on
 society.
 Swift,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 gifted
 five
 memberships.


Appreciate
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 gifted
 five.
 Uh


Muckabe,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 Super


Jack.
 Congrats
 on
 Pound
 Churn
 and
 Nvidia


Partnership.
 Both
 big
 positions
 in
 your


portfolio.
 Just
 need
 Jensen
 to
 partner


with
 Hood
 also.
 So,
 happy
 belated


birthday,
 Makabe.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 and


thank
 you
 for
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.


Dude,
 if
 Jensen
 just
 said
 Robin
 Hood
 or


Grab,


I
 would
 have
 actually


if
 Jensen
 had
 said
 grab,
 I
 would
 have


gone
 to
 Southeast
 Asia
 and
 got
 a
 tattoo


of
 Grab


on
 my
 ass.


I
 would
 have
 done
 it,
 you
 know,
 but
 he


didn't
 say
 it.
 So,
 unfortunately,


Unfortunately,
 it's
 not
 happening.


Unfortunately,
 it's
 not
 happening.
 This


freaking
 stock,
 dude,
 if
 if
 I
 had
 put


the
 money
 I
 have
 in
 Grab
 and
 Invidia
 or


Palanteer
 or
 Hood
 or
 Iran
 or
 Nebul
 or


all
 these
 other
 freaking
 stocks
 that


have
 taken
 off,
 it
 would
 it
 would
 have


made,
 you
 know,
 the
 year
 to
 dates.
 Oh,


let's
 do
 year
 to
 dates.
 We
 haven't
 even


done
 year
 to
 dates
 over
 the
 past
 week


because
 I
 missed
 Friday.
 So,
 let's
 do


year
 to
 dates.
 But,
 it
 would
 have
 made


the
 year
 to
 date
 better.
 But
 I
 do
 think


this
 quarter


could
 be
 a
 quarter
 that
 really
 can


change
 the
 narrative
 on
 Grab.


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.
 I
 also


think,
 again,
 I
 just
 really
 think
 that


them
 toying
 with
 it
 at
 630,
 640,
 then


back
 to
 570.
 I
 really
 think
 it's


nonsense.
 It
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


to
 me.
 There's
 no
 fundamental
 reason


behind
 it.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 more


that's
 more
 shaking
 out
 the
 weak
 hands.


And
 it's
 annoying
 to
 deal
 with.
 It's


what
 you
 have
 to
 I
 dealt
 with
 it
 with


hood.
 I
 deal doubled
 it
 with
 pounder.
 A


lot
 of
 you
 deal
 with
 it
 with
 SoFi,
 but


then
 you
 get
 a
 big
 daddy
 quarter
 that


shuts
 everybody
 up.
 And


hopefully
 we
 can
 get
 that
 from
 Grab
 next


Monday.
 All right,
 my
 year
 to
 date
 178.


178
 on
 the
 year
 to
 date.


Dude,
 back
 on
 October
 10th,
 this
 thing


went
 back
 down
 to
 like
 120.
 I
 think
 the


highest
 we
 were
 at
 was
 204
 at
 one
 point.


This
 thing
 went
 back
 down
 to
 120.
 So,


it's
 been
 a
 wild
 swing
 over
 the
 past


three
 weeks,
 but
 we're
 back
 to
 178.


Yeah,
 dude.
 I'm
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 triple


digits
 right
 here.
 Carlos
 373,
 Uzi
 47,


Quantess
 477.
 She's
 crushed
 it
 with


Quantum
 this
 year
 and
 a
 variety
 of
 other


plays.
 Uh
 size
 181,


Tim
 141,


Schu
 600.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 these
 these
 are


wild
 numbers.
 If
 you
 are
 anything
 above


18%,
 you
 are
 beating
 the
 S&P.
 Just


remember
 that
 you
 have
 to
 beat
 18%
 to


justify
 not
 putting
 your
 money.
 If
 you


can
 do
 18%
 this
 year,
 you
 can
 justify


not
 putting
 your
 money
 in
 the
 S&P
 and


staring
 at
 candlesticks
 all
 day.
 You
 got


to
 just
 beat
 that
 number
 to
 be
 able
 to


say
 it's
 okay
 for
 me
 to
 stare
 at


candlesticks
 all
 day.


Tess
 said
 no
 options,
 no
 leverage.
 Well,


that's
 even
 more
 impressive
 because
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 definitely
 use
 options


to
 help
 magnify
 the
 gains.
 So,
 that's


incredible.
 Austin
 101.
 There
 you
 go.


Austin
 right
 there.
 Triple
 digits
 now


year
 to
 date.
 Again,
 he
 was
 pounding
 the


table
 on
 the
 googs
 and
 that
 one
 has
 very


well
 worked
 out.
 Alex
 at
 43,
 Legit
 Scott


at
 158,
 Danielle
 at
 78.
 Incredible.
 Stav


at
 768,


Flyjack
 706.


Thank
 you,
 Nvidia.
 Nebia's
 hood.


It's
 amazing,
 dude.
 Absolutely
 amazing.


I
 think
 if
 we
 were
 to
 end
 the
 year


today,
 all
 of
 us
 would
 be
 pretty
 happy.


If
 we
 ended
 on
 October
 10th,
 we
 would


have
 been
 pretty
 upset.
 But
 if
 we
 end


the
 end
 the
 year
 here,
 it's
 not
 too
 bad.


And
 then
 look,
 if
 you
 got
 7,000
 coming


up,
 you
 got
 rate
 cuts
 coming
 up,
 and
 you


got
 these
 earnings
 that
 are
 going
 to


crush,
 maybe
 these
 numbers
 can
 continue


to
 expand.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 greedy,


but
 like
 maybe
 there's
 a
 real
 shot
 that


these
 numbers


have
 some
 room
 left
 to
 expand
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


but
 we
 just
 got
 to
 get
 good
 earnings.


Doug's
 at
 212.
 That's
 incredible.
 Tai
 at


137,
 Stephen
 at
 56,


June
 at
 75.


Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 average


here
 has
 to
 be
 around
 that
 40
 50%.
 So,


incredible,
 incredible
 stuff.
 Absolutely


incredible.
 All right,
 let's
 bring
 on


Mr.
 Steven
 Fiorillo
 and
 get
 his
 thoughts


on
 one
 of
 the
 craziest
 days
 in
 AI
 today.


Dave,
 what's
 up?


>> What's
 happening,


dude?
 What
 a
 day.


>> Can
 I


So,
 can
 I
 tell
 you
 something?
 Wait,


before
 you
 show
 this,
 get
 go
 back
 to
 the


regular
 screen.
 Not
 only
 do
 I
 have
 the


whole
 milk
 light
 side,
 okay,
 we're
 not


going
 dark
 side
 because
 it's
 a
 great


day.


A
 blueberry
 loaf
 also.


>> A
 blueberry
 loaf.


>> A
 blueberry
 loaf
 fresh
 out
 of
 the
 oven.


>> Did
 your
 Did
 your
 wife
 make
 that?


>> Freaking
 amazing,


>> dude.
 That's
 got
 It's
 b
 It's
 made
 with


love,
 too.
 Now
 you
 got
 it.
 You
 got
 to


enjoy
 that.


>> Freaking
 amazing.


>> Loaf
 and
 milk.
 Okay.
 Is
 that
 the


announce?
 What
 was
 your
 announcement?


You
 said
 you
 had
 an
 announcement.


>> Yep.


Got
 an
 announcement.
 We're
 going
 to


break
 it
 on
 AK
 Media.
 Why?


>> Wait,
 wait,
 hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.


This
 is
 like
 a
 legit
 legit.
 You're
 not


trolling,
 but
 it's
 like
 legit


announcement.


>> No.
 Why
 would
 I
 be
 trolling?


>> Okay.
 So,
 hold
 on
 before
 you
 say
 it.
 Is


it
 stock
 market
 related?
 Life
 related?


>> Yes.
 Stock
 market
 related.


>> Stock
 market.


Okay,
 let
 let's
 give
 everyone
 two


minutes
 to
 guess
 what
 the
 announcement


is.
 So,
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 what
 do
 you


think?
 Dude,
 you
 better
 not
 disappoint.


This
 better
 not
 be a
 stupid


announcement.
 We
 gota
 now
 we're
 hyping


it
 up
 now.
 So,
 this
 better
 be
 this


better
 be
 good.


He
 bought
 Robin
 Hood.


He's
 coming
 out
 with
 a
 milk
 brand.
 Oh,


I'm
 gonna
 guess
 I'm
 gonna
 guess
 I'm


probably
 wrong.
 I'm
 gonna
 guess
 you


finally
 bought
 Pounder,
 but
 I
 really


doubt
 at
 190
 he
 would
 pull
 the
 trigger


on
 Pounder.


He
 bought
 SoFi.
 We
 He
 already
 has
 SoFi.


He
 bought
 Grab.
 There's
 no
 way
 in
 hell


he
 bought
 Grab.
 He
 bought
 PayPal.


Quit
 his
 job.
 Well,
 he's
 saying
 it's
 a


stock
 market
 announcement.


So,
 it's
 about
 a
 stock,
 right?


Or
 are
 you
 or
 is
 or
 can
 we
 guess
 more


broadly?
 You


>> do
 whatever
 you
 want,
 buddy.


>> You're
 really
 enjoying
 that
 blueberry


loaf,
 bro.
 You're
 really


>> It's
 so
 good.


>> All
 right,
 go
 for
 it.
 What's
 the


announcement?
 What
 do
 we
 got?


>> Well,


as
 you
 know,
 I
 took
 off
 today.


>> I


>> And
 I
 may
 watch
 more
 CNBC
 today
 than
 I


have
 in
 past
 week.


and


come
 to
 a
 conclusion.


We're
 not
 bullish
 enough.
 And
 how
 about


this?
 There's
 a
 world
 where
 we
 hit
 7,000


on
 Friday.
 There
 is
 also
 a
 world


I
 can't
 believe
 I'm
 going
 to
 freaking


say
 this
 with
 conviction,
 like
 not


trolling.
 I
 can't
 believe
 I'm
 going
 to


say
 it
 because
 if
 I
 say
 it,
 I
 can't
 take


it
 back,
 right?


I
 feel
 like
 the
 words
 that
 want
 to
 come


out
 of
 my
 mouth
 is
 I
 have
 to
 raise
 my


end
 of
 year
 target
 to
 7,200


if
 this
 week
 goes
 well
 because
 and


here's
 why.
 I
 don't
 see
 anything
 taking


this
 market
 down
 if
 we
 get
 out
 of
 this


week
 in
 the
 green.
 And
 here's
 why.
 Yay


cut
 in
 the
 big
 five
 if
 they
 smash
 we're


at
 just
 under
 6,900.


You
 don't
 have
 to.
 You
 could
 get
 two


good
 days
 and
 be
 at
 7,000
 at
 this
 point.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I'm
 gonna
 do
 a
 poll
 in
 the


chat,
 but
 before
 I
 do
 the
 poll,
 give
 me


your
 number.
 Are
 you
 saying
 you're
 not


officially
 saying
 it,
 but
 are
 you
 saying


something?


>> I'm
 officially
 saying
 it,
 but
 I'm
 saying


that
 if
 this
 week
 goes
 well,


I
 will
 be
 upping
 my
 price
 target
 for
 end


of
 year,


and
 I'm
 not
 taking
 that
 lightly.


Okay.
 So,
 7200
 end
 of
 year,
 yes
 or
 no?


What
 do
 people
 think?


>> Do
 you
 think
 that's
 crazy
 to
 even
 think


about
 at
 this
 point?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 obviously
 as
 the
 market


goes
 up,
 like
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the


fallacy
 of
 price
 targets.
 It
 becomes


very
 easy
 to
 see
 a
 price
 target
 up
 or


down
 if
 the
 stock
 or
 the
 market
 goes
 in


the
 direction
 you
 want.
 So,
 it's
 it's


no,
 it's
 not
 that
 hard
 to
 see
 7200


because
 we're
 inching
 towards
 10,000.
 It


was
 harder
 back
 when
 it
 was
 5,000.


Right.


>> Right.
 So
 it
 would
 be
 a
 lot
 harder
 to


see
 7,000
 if
 we
 were
 read
 5500.
 So
 um
 or


6,500.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


crazy,
 but
 I
 think
 your
 logic
 makes


sense
 because
 you
 have
 rate
 cuts
 and


then
 the
 big
 five
 and
 if
 they
 crush,


which
 given
 these
 smaller
 companies,
 I


don't
 know
 how
 they
 don't.


>> If
 they
 crush,


it
 should
 take
 the
 market
 higher.
 And


then
 in
 November,
 you
 get
 Broadcom
 and


freaking
 Nvidia
 for
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


tailwinds.


And
 how
 about
 this?


>> In
 this
 market,


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 get
 a
 real
 tax


loss
 harvesting
 se
 because
 nobody's


gonna
 want
 to
 [ __ ]
 pay
 taxes
 on
 this


stuff.
 How
 about
 that?


>> So,
 call
 him
 Steve
 Lee.


>> Are
 we
 changing
 my
 name
 to
 Steve
 Lee?


>> Well,
 even
 Tom
 Lee
 doesn't
 have
 72.
 He


has
 7,000
 still.
 So,


>> right.


Whenever
 this
 stuff
 happens
 and
 we
 have


this
 conversation,
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit


of
 euphoria
 on
 a
 good
 day
 that
 we
 all


feel
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 72
 73


because
 I
 do
 feel
 like
 that's
 getting


very
 aggressive.
 However,
 to
 your
 point,


you
 got
 the
 rate
 cut
 and
 then
 you
 got


earnings
 and
 then
 you
 got
 Nvidia
 that


just
 said
 they're
 going to
 do
 five.
 You


just
 heard
 that
 number
 500
 billion
 in


five
 quarters
 is
 what
 Nvidia.


>> Dude,
 your
 chat
 is
 freaking
 amazing.


Like
 they're
 the
 best.
 They
 are
 the


freaking
 best.


Steve
 Thomas,
 Milk
 Lee.


The
 best.


>> The
 China
 deal
 as
 well.
 Yes,
 China
 deal


is
 also
 really
 important.


>> Like
 I
 I've
 been
 trying
 to
 blow
 a
 hole


in
 my
 theory
 about
 what
 could
 possibly


take
 this
 market
 down.


I'm
 not
 The
 only
 thing
 that
 I
 can
 see
 is


if
 the
 Fed
 says,
 uh,


we're
 shook.
 We're
 not
 cutting.


Um,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 We
 got
 our


Cactus
 Jack
 update
 right
 here.
 For
 those


that
 don't
 know,
 Cactus
 Jack
 is
 our


personal
 Bloomberg.
 So,
 whenever
 you
 see


an
 update
 from
 him,
 uh,
 it
 is
 him


getting
 the
 news
 and
 putting
 it
 out


there.
 Wow.
 US
 Agricultural
 Secretary


Rollins
 says
 soybean
 agreement
 with


China
 is
 almost
 finalized.
 And
 you
 got


soybeans.


>> Where's
 the
 S&P
 on
 the
 S&P
 687?
 You
 got


a
 candle


again.
 Soybeans
 rate
 cuts,
 earnings.


You've
 got
 some
 good
 news.


My
 only
 other
 fear
 is
 that
 it
 might
 be


priced
 in
 over
 the
 next
 coming
 weeks.
 I


I
 don't
 think
 it
 necessarily
 is,
 but
 if


it
 if
 it
 is,
 you
 could
 get
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 just
 stag
 stagnation
 in
 the
 market.


But
 if
 we
 stagnate
 around
 6,900
 6950,


like
 that's
 okay.
 You
 know,
 eventually


we
 can
 make
 that
 move.


>> Yeah.
 But
 how
 about
 this?


In
 a
 world
 where
 people
 like
 think
 about


it,
 everybody
 in
 your
 run
 this
 poll
 a


minute
 is
 anybody
 tax
 loss
 harvesting
 or


taking
 profits
 by
 end
 of
 the
 year
 at


this
 point.
 I'm
 willing
 to
 bet
 people


that
 are
 up
 three,
 four,
 500%
 on
 stuff


have
 no
 interest
 in
 selling
 and
 paying


that
 tax
 this
 year.
 So
 if
 you
 don't
 have


people
 doing
 that
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these


people
 don't
 have
 losses
 that
 they
 would


even
 consider
 offsetting.
 So
 if
 you


don't
 get
 a
 tax
 loss
 harvesting
 season


the
 way
 that
 you
 have
 in
 the
 past


and
 then
 there's
 just
 money
 coming
 into


the
 market
 at
 some
 point


it's
 going
 to
 go
 from
 7.4
 to
 6.4


trillion
 in
 money
 market
 accounts


because


there's
 less
 of
 a
 reason
 to
 stay
 there.


I'm
 just
 at
 this
 point
 not
 really
 seeing


anything
 that's
 going
 to
 hold
 us
 back


unless
 something
 out
 of
 the
 blue
 happens


that
 we
 can't
 handicap.
 But


it's
 not
 even
 November
 yet
 and
 we
 hit


6,900.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 Nvidia
 busted
 through


basically
 five
 trillion
 on
 not
 even


earnings.


>> I
 mean
 that
 is
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 that's


bearish,
 dude.
 It
 really
 is.
 You
 know,


and
 you
 know
 what
 the
 next
 question
 is?


If
 Nvidia
 holds
 this,


when
 does
 Apple
 and
 Microsoft
 hit
 5


trillion?


And
 then
 is
 there
 a
 catch-up
 trade
 in


Amazon
 and
 Alphabet
 and
 Meta?


>> You
 know,
 Apple
 hit
 four
 trillion
 today


too,
 right?


>> I
 know.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 said
 the
 next


question
 is
 going
 to
 be
 when
 do
 they
 hit


five
 and
 then
 when
 the
 when
 do
 the


others
 hit
 three?


This
 could
 be
 a
 free
 train
 that
 doesn't


freaking
 stop.
 There's
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 on


the
 sidelines.


>> Let
 me
 ask
 you
 this.
 Are
 you
 selling
 any


Nvidia?


>> No,
 we
 I
 considered


>> See,
 I
 considered
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,


too,
 but
 I
 I
 didn't.


>> Right.
 So,
 I


>> I
 loosely
 considered
 today
 selling
 10%


to
 move
 it
 into
 QXO,
 but
 I
 didn't.


>> Why?
 Why
 didn't
 you?


>> Because
 of
 the
 damn
 chart.
 That's
 why.


And
 I
 got
 a
 little
 greedy.


>> Well,
 like
 dude,
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 if


anyone's
 selling
 a
 video.
 I
 I
 like
 when


you
 hear
 what
 Jensen
 says
 and
 you
 look


at
 their
 Ford
 multiple
 and
 you
 look
 at


the
 technology
 that
 like
 we're
 we're


we're
 tech
 investors.
 When
 you
 see
 that,


you're
 like,
 "How
 do
 I
 fade
 that?"
 Like,


"How
 do
 I
 actually
 say?"


>> You
 actually
 don't
 say
 that.


>> No,
 you
 don't.
 I
 agree.


>> Robots
 aren't
 even
 here
 yet.


Yeah,
 and
 I
 mean
 that's
 a
 whole
 another


vertical
 as
 well.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,
 we'll


get
 back
 to
 Invidia
 second,
 but
 but
 I


mean
 you
 you
 just
 put
 an
 article
 on


SoFi.
 I'm
 going
 to
 link
 the
 article
 for


those
 that
 want
 to
 read
 it.
 Now
 that


you've
 had


>> now
 that
 you've
 had
 10
 hours
 to
 to


digest
 it,
 how
 are
 you
 feeling
 about


>> the
 quarter?


>> I
 can
 tell
 you
 I
 was
 one
 foot
 in,
 one


foot
 out
 before,
 if
 you
 go
 read
 this


article,


I'm
 back
 in
 the
 camp
 that
 we're
 hitting


45.
 Do
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 flip-flopper
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 SoFi?


Because
 on
 SoFi
 Weekly,
 you
 were
 like


45,
 get
 the
 hell
 out.
 Now
 you're
 like,


well,
 and
 that's
 okay
 to
 I
 I'm
 a


flip-flopper
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


stocks,
 too.
 But
 like,
 do
 you
 feel
 you


have
 that
 lovehate
 relationship
 with


SoFi?


>> I
 don't
 have
 a
 lovehate
 relationship.
 I


have
 a
 real
 reality
 relationship
 until


not
 changes
 my
 freaking
 mind
 with
 how


good
 their
 damn
 earnings
 are.
 And
 the


things
 that
 put
 it
 over
 the
 top
 for
 me,


stable
 coin,
 global
 payments,


crypto
 by
 end
 of
 year,
 level
 one
 options


already.
 So
 there's
 just
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 it
 right
 now.
 So


>> a
 lot
 of
 that
 was
 known
 before
 the


quarter,
 though.
 It's
 not
 like
 that's


brand
 new
 in


>> Well,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.


>> You
 didn't
 know
 they
 were
 doing
 stable


coin
 stuff?


>> There
 was
 nothing
 official
 about
 that.


>> I
 mean,
 they
 definitely
 mentioned
 it
 a


couple.
 Yeah,
 that's
 fair.
 They
 they


talked
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 it
 today.
 That's


That's
 fair.


>> They're
 next
 quarter
 will
 be
 a
 billion


dollar
 quarter.
 Think
 about
 it.
 They
 hit


950
 in
 revenue
 this
 quarter.
 There's
 no


way
 they
 don't
 come
 out
 Q4
 over
 a


billion
 dollars
 and
 then
 every
 quarter


going
 forward
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 than
 a


billion.


So,
 you
 think
 it's
 possible?
 So,
 so
 I


had
 learned
 this
 last
 night
 and
 this


actually
 got
 me
 on
 your
 side
 of
 the


camp.
 Um,
 from
 what
 you
 said
 on
 SoFi


Weekly,
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 I
 mean,
 you


probably
 know
 this,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 have


to
 just
 get
 to
 45.
 It
 has
 to
 stay.


>> So
 that
 means
 by
 March,


>> Yeah.


>> it's
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't
 get
 to
 45
 by


March,
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 at
 like
 75
 for
 a


couple
 weeks
 to
 balance
 out
 the
 volume.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 The
 volume
 has
 to
 be
 an


average
 of
 45
 for
 90
 days.


>> I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 not
 possible,
 but


that's
 four
 months
 for
 them
 to
 make
 that


move,
 right?


>> Which
 means
 it's
 got
 to
 happen
 like


soon.
 I
 I
 thought
 that
 they
 had
 no


freaking
 chance.


Now,


you
 know,
 I'm
 one
 foot
 back
 in
 on
 this.


This
 this
 could
 happen.


And
 and
 then
 the
 broader
 reason
 is
 you


think
 crypto,
 stable
 coin,
 and
 more


payment
 infrastructure
 is
 the
 catalyst.


>> Yeah.
 And
 look,
 here's
 the
 other
 thing.


As
 a
 nationally
 chartered
 bank,
 they
 can


increase
 the
 spread
 on
 their
 net


interest
 margin
 as
 interest
 rates
 fall.


Because
 if
 they
 have
 fixed
 loans
 and
 not


floating
 rate
 that
 they
 already
 put
 out,


they're
 collecting
 that
 fee
 and
 then


paying
 less
 on
 the
 deposits.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 they
 automatically
 increase
 their


spread
 on
 the
 NIM.


>> That's
 fair.
 That's
 a
 good
 point.


>> So
 that
 means
 that
 their
 banking


profitability
 goes
 through
 the
 roof.


>> Okay.
 So
 would
 you
 would
 you
 buy
 a
 31?


Not
 look,
 I'm
 not
 personally
 buying
 it,


but
 I'm
 no
 longer
 considering
 selling


it.


>> Makes
 sense.


>> And
 you
 know
 what
 was
 the
 big
 thing


today?
 The
 reversal.
 Staring
 at
 the


chart
 because
 I
 look,
 I
 never
 look
 at


charts.
 I
 never
 follow
 this
 stuff


because
 I'm
 in
 meetings
 all
 day.
 Sitting


here
 in
 front
 of
 a
 computer
 the
 whole


time
 and
 having
 and
 trying
 not
 to
 look


at
 my
 email
 even
 though
 I
 took
 two


meetings
 and
 sent
 like
 five
 emails.


Even
 though
 I
 did
 that,
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of


time
 to
 stare
 at
 charts
 and
 reflect.
 I'm


sitting
 there
 watching
 SoFi
 and
 I'm


like,
 "This
 thing's
 crashing.
 It's
 going


to
 25."
 Then
 the
 next
 thing
 I
 see
 it
 get


back
 stopped
 and
 then
 fly.
 This
 ain't


going
 to
 25.


You
 know,
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,


Ste,
 this
 was
 Steve's
 uh


uh
 first
 day
 in
 in
 what,
 10
 years,


taking
 a
 day
 off?


>> Not
 10
 years,
 but
 since


since
 last
 year.
 I
 think
 last
 winter.


>> It's
 been
 a
 year.
 Last
 year.


>> Well,
 I
 got
 sick
 over
 the
 summer,
 so
 I


had
 to
 take
 a
 couple
 of
 sick
 days.
 I
 got


violently
 sick.


>> No,
 but
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 that.


When's
 the last
 time
 you
 took
 a
 day
 off


to
 do
 something
 fun
 like
 SoFi
 earnings?


Like,
 when's
 the
 last
 time
 you
 did
 that


type
 of
 a
 day
 off?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Last
 year.


>> Okay.
 So,
 it's
 been
 about
 a
 year
 since


you
 took
 and
 you
 took
 it
 off
 for


vacation.
 I
 lose
 vacation
 time
 every


year
 because
 I
 never
 take
 days
 off.


is
 when
 I
 take
 day
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 back


tomorrow
 and
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 300
 or
 400


emails
 I
 have
 to
 read
 through


plus
 all
 the
 other
 work
 I
 gota
 get
 done.


So


>> you
 guys
 are
 nuts
 to
 call
 earnings
 fun.


No,
 they're
 fun.
 It's
 just


kidding
 me.


>> So
 much
 fun.


>> All
 right,
 so
 granted
 the
 SoFi
 earnings


call
 was
 a
 little
 tedious
 but
 in
 general


earnings
 are
 very
 fun.


When
 are
 you
 quitting
 the
 job
 and
 going


YouTube
 full-time?
 Because
 because
 it


obviously
 seems
 like
 you
 like
 doing


this.
 So,


>> it's
 not
 happening.


>> You
 You
 don't
 think
 there's
 ever
 a
 world


where
 you


>> I
 mean,
 if
 I
 start
 having
 viewership


like
 yours,
 it
 could
 be
 a
 conversation,


I
 guess.


>> No,
 but
 to
 get
 there,
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got


to
 take
 the
 risk,


>> right?
 Go
 [ __ ]
 That's
 why
 I'm
 saying
 I


don't
 think
 anytime
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


happening.


I
 did
 enjoy
 going
 live
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 day
 for
 45
 minutes
 though
 and
 you


guys
 weren't
 live
 because
 I
 don't
 want


to
 freaking
 go
 live
 when
 you
 guys
 are


live.
 So,
 I
 went
 for
 live
 for
 like
 45


minutes.


It
 was
 fun.


>> Wait,
 wait.
 I
 didn't
 get
 your
 thoughts


on
 on
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 like,


dude,


we've
 been
 waiting
 for
 this
 day
 forever.


It
 happened.


>> What
 happened?


What
 do
 you
 mean?
 What
 happened?
 What


are


>> we
 talking
 about?


>> Jensen
 finally
 said
 Palinger.


>> Yeah.
 And
 he
 says
 the
 most
 important


software
 stack
 there
 is.


>> Were
 you
 Did
 you
 not


>> Did
 you
 not
 have
 one
 of
 those
 moments


when
 you
 heard
 this
 or


>> No,
 I
 think
 we
 all
 knew
 it.


But
 you
 still
 did
 it
 like
 did
 did
 your


heart
 like
 my
 heart
 was
 beating
 but
 did


that
 like
 did
 you
 not
 like


>> you
 know


did
 you
 not


you
 know


>> it
 it
 was
 good
 validation
 for
 the


community.


>> I
 feel
 like
 you
 didn't
 care.


>> It
 was
 really
 good
 validation
 for
 the


community.


>> I
 feel
 like
 Steve
 didn't
 care.
 He
 was


like,
 "All
 right,
 cool.
 Whatever."


>> Dude,
 that
 was
 fun.
 Jensen
 finally


mentioning
 and
 then
 carp
 and
 him
 on
 CNBC


together
 like


>> I
 saw
 it.


>> Been
 waiting
 so
 long
 for
 this.


>> I
 saw
 it.


>> I'm
 surprised
 you
 don't
 already
 have
 it


as
 a
 poster
 in
 your
 room.


>> Like
 I'm
 surprised
 it's
 not
 behind
 you


as
 a
 poster
 already.


>> I
 mean,
 bro,
 I
 already
 have
 him
 as
 the


background.
 Like
 I
 mean


>> I
 know.
 But
 like
 you
 really
 So
 you


should
 find
 you
 what
 you
 should
 do
 is


play
 the
 clip,
 get
 a
 still
 of
 them


sitting
 there
 together,
 send
 it
 to
 Kinko


and
 have
 them
 make
 like
 a
 beautiful


thing
 for
 you
 to
 hang
 up.


>> I
 should.


>> You
 should.
 You
 should.


>> You
 should.


>> All right.
 So
 the
 big
 news
 of
 the
 day,


Nvidia
 basically
 said
 AI
 is
 real.
 They


reminded
 everybody
 increased
 guidance.


>> What's
 the
 bear
 case?


Tell
 me
 what
 the
 bear
 case
 is.
 Like


we've
 been
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 the
 bear


case.
 And
 guess
 what?


When
 you
 blow
 up
 a
 balloon,
 like
 in


order
 for
 a
 bubble
 to
 pop,
 right?
 It


needs
 to
 pop.
 So
 if
 we
 look
 at
 this
 as
 a


balloon,
 what
 happens
 before
 a
 balloon


pops,
 it
 expands,
 it
 expands,
 and
 it


expands.


What
 part
 of
 the
 cycle
 are
 we
 in
 blowing


up
 a
 balloon?
 from
 it.


>> Look,
 the
 only
 thing
 I
 could
 have


pointed
 to
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 was
 that


there
 are
 some
 speculative
 companies


that
 are
 running
 on,
 you
 know,
 no


revenue,
 no
 earnings,
 etc.
 However,
 a


lot
 of
 those
 came
 down.
 They're
 starting


to
 normalize.
 They're
 not
 like


>> up
 as
 much
 as
 they
 were
 before.
 And


again,
 even
 if
 they
 were,
 to
 your
 point


you
 made
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 who
 cares


if
 anything
 happens
 to
 them
 because


they're
 not
 Amazon,
 Nvidia,
 Meta,


Google,
 etc.


I
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 as
 bubbish.
 I
 really


don't.


>> Nope.
 Because
 they
 could
 get
 cut
 in


half.
 They
 could
 get
 cut
 by
 75%.
 It


doesn't
 freaking
 matter.
 They're
 not


part
 of
 the
 S&P.
 They're
 not
 part
 of
 the


Dow.
 They're
 not
 part
 part
 of
 the
 NASDAQ


100.
 Who
 cares?


And
 also,
 they
 could
 get
 a
 deal
 that


change
 that
 justifies
 their
 market
 cap


tomorrow
 if
 they're
 in
 a
 sector
 that,


you
 know,
 is
 so
 important
 when
 it
 comes


to
 AI,
 energy,
 for
 example,
 that
 that


could
 change
 everything.
 So
 there


there's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to
 some


of
 these
 companies.


Then
 when
 you
 look
 to
 the
 Max
 7,
 the


only
 one
 that's
 not
 really
 growing
 is


Tesla.
 But
 Tesla
 just
 has
 so
 much


potential
 that
 yeah,
 you
 can
 say
 the


valuation
 is
 aggressive,
 but
 you
 can't


say
 it's
 a
 bubble.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 hard
 for


me
 to
 to
 believe,


>> right?
 It's
 an
 aggressive
 valuation


based
 on
 what
 may
 happen.


But
 at
 the
 same
 time,


where's
 the
 bear
 case?
 It
 doesn't
 seem


like
 we
 have
 any
 international
 fears
 at


this
 point.


It
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 we're
 in
 a
 trade


war.


Earnings
 are
 strong.
 You
 may
 have
 real


productivity
 enhancements
 on
 a
 broader


market.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 to
 look


forward
 to.
 The
 two
 things
 that
 get
 me


worried
 still
 are
 unemployment


and
 the
 potential
 of
 recession
 next


year.
 But
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 we
 have
 a


recession
 that
 that
 even
 needs
 to
 matter


for
 the
 stock
 market.
 I
 hate
 saying


that,
 but
 how
 much
 of
 the
 stock
 market


profits
 are
 driven
 by
 corporate
 America


instead
 of
 individuals?


>> What
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying


Trump
 could
 tweet?
 That
 could


>> Sure,
 he
 could
 tweet
 and
 then
 he's
 going


to
 tweet
 something
 else
 in
 an
 hour
 or


the
 next
 day.
 Think
 about
 the
 Friday


selloff
 and
 the
 Monday
 recovery.
 I
 mean,


if
 we
 know
 anything
 about
 Trump,
 he
 uses


social
 media
 as
 a
 freaking
 bargaining


chip.


Yeah,


>> I
 agree.
 And
 if
 he
 tweets
 something,


dude,
 Trump
 loves
 the
 stock
 market
 being


up,
 so
 he
 does
 not
 want


>> And
 we're
 going
 into
 midterms.
 You


really
 think
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 crash


the
 stock
 market
 for
 midterms?


>> All
 right,
 so
 risk
 on.


>> I
 feel
 like
 we're
 going
 back
 into
 risk


on.
 I
 hate
 saying
 it,
 but
 you
 know
 what?


We're
 in
 1989.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 stop


saying
 it.


I
 really
 don't
 think
 that
 we've
 left
 for


the
 party
 yet.


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 in
 1989.
 I
 think


with
 the
 amount
 of
 capex
 that's
 been


spent,
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 say
 we're


that
 early.
 Like
 I


>> But
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 capex.
 Think


about
 what
 needs
 to
 happen
 now.
 You
 need


a
 fullon
 robotic
 overhaul.


You
 full-blown
 AI
 implementation.


Think
 about
 what
 that
 runway
 is
 going
 to


look
 like.
 Oh,
 that's


>> you
 still
 have
 companies
 doing
 a
 cloud


build
 out.


>> I
 I
 would
 say
 there's
 sectors
 of
 the


market
 that
 are
 1989
 because
 LLMs
 you


cannot
 say
 are
 1989.
 I
 mean,
 when
 we're


seeing
 Grock
 4,
 that's
 not
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 party.
 There's
 no
 way.
 That's
 the


worst
 it's
 ever
 going
 to
 be.
 But
 I
 think


the
 party
 started
 with
 robots.
 I
 think


we're
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 party.
 I


agree.
 But
 then
 again,
 you
 had
 a
 robot


company
 that
 shipped
 a
 robot
 today
 for


$20,000.
 Neo,


>> what
 about
 full
 self-driving?
 What
 about


all
 the
 productivity
 yet?


>> Full
 self-driving
 is
 not
 1989,
 dude.


Where
 FSD14
 is
 very


>> Dude,
 you
 can't
 take
 a
 nap
 in
 your
 car


yet.


>> Yeah,
 but
 that's
 not
 10
 years
 away.


>> I
 get
 that.
 What
 I'm
 saying
 is
 1989
 is


the
 revenue
 expansion
 and
 profitability


expansion.


>> No,
 but
 but but
 that
 implies
 there's
 at


least
 a
 5
 to
 10
 year
 cycle
 for
 that.
 I


think
 Tesla
 FSD
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years,


if
 it's
 not
 unsupervised
 in
 two
 years,


there's
 an
 issue.
 And
 it's
 not
 a
 tech


problem.
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 more
 regulatory


and
 all
 the
 other
 concerns
 they
 have.


>> I
 just
 think
 that
 we're
 in
 a
 golden
 age


of
 freaking


golden
 age
 of
 technology
 right
 now.


>> Oh,
 that
 I
 agree
 with.


>> And
 it's
 crazy
 to
 say
 because
 of
 the


amount
 of
 technological
 advancements


we've
 seen,
 but
 I
 look
 at
 it
 from
 when


we
 were
 in
 2005,


smartphones
 weren't
 even
 a
 thing
 yet.


Okay?
 You
 have
 Palm
 Pilots
 and


Blackberries.


Blackberries.
 It
 was
 amazing.
 You
 get


your
 email
 on
 a
 cell
 phone
 and
 then
 Jobs


came
 out
 with
 the
 first
 iPhone
 and
 then


you
 got
 cloud
 and
 then
 you
 got
 SAS.
 And


in
 the
 2010s,
 the
 rate
 of
 expansion.


We're
 seeing
 such
 a
 bigger
 multiple
 on


expansion
 right
 now.
 not
 on
 price,
 but


just
 how
 much
 freaking
 technological


innovation
 we're
 having
 that
 I
 truly


think
 the
 next
 five
 to
 10
 years
 is
 gonna


be
 like
 something
 we've
 never
 seen


before.


>> Well,
 that
 I
 agree
 with
 and
 you
 know


whether
 it's
 the
 very
 beginning
 or
 very


early,
 it's
 definitely
 not
 the
 end.
 That


I
 think
 everyone
 can
 agree
 with
 and
 it's


probably
 if
 it's
 not
 the
 middle
 then


it's
 closer
 to
 the
 beginning
 than
 in
 the


middle
 because
 basically
 we're
 making
 a


metaphor
 for
 are
 we
 late
 cycle
 or
 not?


>> Correct.
 We're
 beginning
 cycle,


>> right?
 And
 in
 a
 bull
 market,
 it's
 hard.


This
 is
 the
 part
 that
 this
 is
 why
 Tom


Lee
 says
 it's
 the
 most
 hated
 market


because
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 late
 cycle.
 Uh


or
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 early
 cycle
 when
 the


when
 when
 you're
 at
 alltime
 highs.


You're
 supposed
 to
 be
 towards
 the
 end
 of


a
 bull
 run,
 but
 we
 have
 that
 30%
 draw


down
 in
 April,
 which
 ironically
 starts
 a


new
 bull
 market
 historically
 after
 you


have
 that
 draw
 down,
 especially
 if


you're
 able
 to
 hold
 a
 recovery
 after
 six


weeks.
 And
 then
 two,
 as
 you're
 saying


with
 the
 technological


uh
 shifts,
 LLM,
 FSD,
 evol,
 robotics,


drug
 discovery,
 all
 that
 stuff
 has
 at


least
 five
 to
 10
 years
 of
 really
 being


uh
 having
 having
 a
 runway
 to
 expand


>> and
 that
 means
 this
 whole
 cycle
 might


have
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 have
 this


conversation
 with
 Ives
 so
 I
 could
 just


be
 like
 to
 him,
 dude,
 1996,


we're
 not
 even
 at
 dinner,
 dude.
 We're


We're
 still
 at
 freaking
 happy
 hour
 at


the
 bar
 at
 4
 PM.
 Like


>> this
 bullish
 on
 tech.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 steal
 man
 yourself,
 why


are
 we
 not
 at
 happy
 hour?
 Why
 Why
 are
 we


at
 the
 party?


>> I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 Because
 there's


no
 logical
 explanation
 for
 me.
 Because


here's
 why.
 CocaCola,


Walmart,
 Costco,
 none
 of
 these
 companies


are
 using
 robotics
 in
 their
 warehouses.


>> It's
 fair.
 None
 of
 these
 companies
 are


freaking
 utilizing
 any
 of
 this
 stuff,


you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 gigantic
 overhaul


going
 over
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years
 that


we're
 truly
 not
 ready
 for
 or
 we're
 not


allowing
 our
 minds
 to
 agree
 with,
 but


it's
 happening.
 We're
 seeing
 it
 happen


with
 Amazon.
 They're
 the
 litmus
 test.


And
 keep
 in
 mind
 what
 Amazon
 has
 today.


If
 you
 bring
 up
 a
 video
 at
 JD.com
 from


like
 2017
 2018,
 China
 was
 so
 far
 ahead


of
 us
 on
 this.
 JD
 had
 fully
 robot
 ro


robotics
 warehouses
 back
 in
 2017
 2018.


So
 I
 I'm
 telling
 you
 the
 we
 are
 just


scratching
 the
 surface
 on
 all
 this.


If
 we
 are
 just
 scratching
 the
 surface
 on


all
 this,
 then
 I
 mean
 what
 do
 you
 think?


Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 20
 trillion.


>> I
 think
 they're
 the
 one
 key
 to
 rule
 them


all
 at
 this
 point.


One
 ring
 to
 rule
 them
 all.
 Infinity


Gauntlet


>> for
 them
 to
 get
 to
 10
 trillion.
 There's


a
 lot.
 I
 mean,
 see,
 well,
 here's
 the


here's
 the
 litmus
 test
 on
 this
 whole


cycle
 question.
 It's
 like,


all right,
 well,
 let
 me
 ask
 what
 you


think
 in
 how
 long
 will
 Nvidia
 be
 putting


up
 a
 couple
 hundred
 billion
 dollars
 of


revenue
 because
 of
 selling
 GPUs?
 How


long
 do
 you
 How
 many
 years
 do
 you
 think?


>> Well,
 a
 couple
 is
 two.
 Do
 you
 want
 to


say
 several?


>> Say
 couple
 hundred
 billion
 in
 revenue,


right?
 Several.
 Sure.
 Several.
 Whatever.


Like
 10
 years.


>> Three
 to
 four.


>> That
 doesn't
 make
 sense.
 Then
 if
 we're


early
 cycle,


>> what
 do
 you
 mean?


>> How
 can
 we
 be
 in
 1989
 and
 video
 only
 has


three
 years
 of
 putting
 up?


>> No,
 no.
 You
 said
 when
 did
 they
 get
 to


that
 point?


Right
 now
 they're
 doing
 about
 200


billion
 of
 revenue
 a
 year,
 right?


>> No.
 Well,
 this
 year
 they're
 going
 to
 do


206.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So,
 my
 question
 is
 how
 many
 years


does
 Nvidia
 have


>> of
 them
 doing
 at
 minimum
 200
 billion
 or


more
 of
 revenue?


>> Dude,
 at least
 a
 decade
 or
 two.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 have
 to
 believe


that,
 right?
 If
 you
 think
 we're
 early,
 I


agree.


>> Have
 you
 looked
 at
 the
 analyst


expectations
 for
 revenue?
 Well,
 I
 know


Jensen
 destroyed
 all
 those
 expectations


today.


>> Uh,


this
 is
 going
 to
 freak
 you
 out
 if
 you


really
 haven't
 looked
 at.
 Bring
 up
 my


screen,
 sir.


So,
 we
 you
 got
 out
 in
 and
 keep
 in
 mind


when
 this
 is
 a
 year
 back
 because
 they


don't
 report
 on
 a
 calendar
 year.
 They


end
 their
 fiscal
 year
 in
 January.
 So,


January
 26
 is
 really
 the
 2025
 fiscal


year.
 So
 in
 2028,
 okay,
 you
 still
 have


five
 analysts
 saying
 that
 they're
 going


to
 do
 350
 billion.


That's
 a
 75%
 increase
 from
 where
 you
 are


this
 year.


>> That's
 true.
 That's
 true.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 three
 analysts


that
 say
 they're
 going to
 do
 378
 in


2029.
 And
 then
 two
 that
 are
 saying


you're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 400
 in
 2030.


>> That's
 doubling
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years.


Who's
 the
 one
 guy
 saying
 they're
 going


to
 do
 700
 billion
 in
 2035?
 That
 is
 wild.


>> I'm
 not
 going
 I
 don't
 like
 going
 out


more
 than
 three
 or
 four
 years
 because


you
 really
 get
 to
 where
 only
 like
 the


most
 Super
 Bowl
 people
 are
 actually


putting
 stuff
 out
 there.
 But
 even
 if
 you


just
 want
 to
 look
 two
 years
 out
 after


this
 year,
 you
 got
 32
 people
 32
 analysts


on
 the
 street
 saying
 that
 we're
 going
 to


grow
 by
 60%
 over
 the
 next
 two
 years
 with


revenue.


Yeah,
 it
 is
 hard.
 It
 is
 really
 hard
 to


sell
 Nvidia
 if
 they
 can
 live
 up
 to
 those


expectations.


>> And
 think
 about
 this,
 they
 got
 a
 55%


profit
 margin.
 Let's
 just
 say
 they


maintain
 a
 50%
 to
 keep
 the
 numbers
 o


easy,
 right?
 That's
 not
 operating,


that's
 profit.
 So


>> yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Three.
 So
 on
 just
 300
 billion,
 that's


150
 billion
 net
 income.


>> And
 when
 they're
 trading
 at
 five


trillion,
 so
 what's
 that
 multiple?


said
 150
 billion.


33
 times,


>> dude.
 They're
 not
 expensive.


>> 33
 times
 is
 not
 I
 mean
 you
 What?
 That


150
 billion
 that's
 for
 28
 or
 or
 27
 or
 29


2


>> 27


>> 27.
 Okay.
 So
 they're
 trading
 at
 33


times.
 That's
 that's
 not


>> dude
 on
 an
 EPS
 metric
 right
 now.
 They're


trading
 it
 25
 times
 on
 just
 EPS.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 all
 of
 this,
 all
 of
 the


everything
 you
 just
 showed,
 all
 of
 it
 is


without
 China.


>> Is
 without
 China.


So,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 do
 I
 do
 I
 sound
 crazy


to
 people
 who
 aren't
 really
 following


things
 closely?
 Sure,
 I
 could
 maybe


sound
 crazy
 right
 now,
 but
 if
 you
 really


take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 think
 about
 what


I'm
 saying
 and
 look
 at
 the
 numbers,
 I


mean,
 it's
 a
 good
 point.
 How
 wh
 why
 do


we
 think
 that
 it's
 1996
 or
 1997?
 Why
 do


we
 think
 there's
 three
 years
 left?


You're
 telling
 me
 that
 everybody's
 going


to
 have
 a
 freaking
 robot
 in
 three
 years?


Companies
 aren't
 even
 going
 to
 have
 what


their
 freaking
 production
 orders
 are.


>> I
 I
 actually
 after
 looking
 at
 the


numbers
 as
 you're
 breaking
 them
 down.
 I


do.
 It's
 hard
 to
 really
 say
 it's
 96
 when


you
 think
 in
 the
 next
 three
 years
 this


stuff
 is
 just
 getting
 started,


especially
 from
 an
 EPS
 standpoint.
 And
 I


keep
 getting
 this
 thing
 going
 in
 my
 mind


that


technological
 advance
 advances
 do
 not


slow
 down.
 They
 only
 accelerate.


>> Of
 course,


>> and
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 rate
 of
 change


with
 just
 a
 CPU,
 the
 Commodore
 64,
 which


I
 had
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 to
 a
 286
 to
 a


386
 to
 a
 486,
 then
 they
 went
 to
 the


Pentium
 chip
 and
 then
 all
 the
 other


chips
 after
 that.
 Now
 what
 we
 have
 now,


this
 is
 just


a
 rate
 of
 change
 that
 is
 so
 crucial.
 I


don't
 see
 that
 this
 is
 stopping
 anytime


soon.
 I
 really
 don't.
 There's
 nothing


that
 is
 going
 to
 derail
 this
 unless
 we


go
 to
 war
 at
 this
 point
 or
 rare
 earth


minerals.
 We
 can't
 make
 enough
 chips.


Those
 are
 the
 only
 two
 things
 that
 can


stop
 this
 at
 this
 point
 because
 every


company
 is
 spending
 on
 this
 and
 we
 have


not
 had
 a
 broad
 market
 rally.
 And
 then


do
 we
 really
 think
 in
 10
 years
 from
 now


we're
 gonna
 have
 humans
 working
 at


McDonald's
 or
 stocking
 shelves
 at


Target?
 You're
 telling
 me
 that
 that's


not
 going
 to
 be
 all
 robotics?


>> Okay.
 So,
 let's
 transition
 to
 that,
 I


guess,
 bare
 case
 that
 you've
 had
 for
 a


while,
 which
 is
 labor
 market.
 I
 feel


like
 that's
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 can


really
 dethrone
 your
 thesis
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 think
 we
 need
 UBI.
 I


really
 do.
 I
 hate
 saying
 it.


Tell
 me
 what
 the
 alternative
 is.


>> Got
 a
 tax.


>> You
 saw
 this.


>> The
 only
 alternative
 is
 you
 have
 a


humanoid
 robot
 tax
 or
 something,
 right?


>> But
 how
 can
 you
 even


make
 enough
 money
 from
 a
 humanoid
 robot


tax
 to
 fix
 the
 problem?


>> Um,


I
 mean,
 bring
 up
 that
 list
 of
 jobs
 or


like


[Music]


what
 are
 all
 these
 people
 going
 to
 do?


at
 once.
 And
 think
 about
 this.
 This
 is


the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,


>> so
 let
 let's
 play
 this
 out,
 right?
 You


get
 full
 self-driving.


Let's
 be
 conservative.


Eight
 years
 from
 now,


you
 would
 say
 probably
 nationalized


allowed


people
 feel
 comfortable
 using
 it
 in


eight
 years.


>> 2035.
 I
 I
 would
 hope
 it's
 earlier
 than


that,
 but
 yes,
 I
 would
 say
 so.


>> Okay.


2035,


you
 now
 have
 nobody
 driving
 Uber.
 You


have
 nobody
 driving
 Lift.
 You
 have


nobody
 driving
 taxis.
 And
 potentially,


you
 have
 nobody
 driving
 all
 the
 trucks


there
 doing
 all
 the
 deliveries.


Within
 that
 eight
 years,
 now
 you
 have


humanoid
 robotics
 in
 the
 vehicles,


trucking
 mainly
 to
 take
 care
 of
 all
 the


deliveries,
 loading
 and
 unloading.


So
 what
 about
 all
 those
 jobs?


What
 about
 McDonald's,
 Wendy's,
 Burger


King?
 You're
 telling
 me
 that
 that's
 not


going
 to
 be
 automated?


What
 about
 stocking
 shelves
 at
 Target?


So
 you're
 telling
 me
 that
 all
 these


shops
 are
 still
 going
 to
 exist
 in
 10


years?


>> And
 there's
 no
 way
 they're
 ever
 coming


back
 once
 they're
 replaced?
 No,


absolutely
 not.


>> I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 It
 is
 a
 scary
 world


to
 think
 about.
 Like
 jobs
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 provide
 humans
 something
 to
 do.


You
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 like


it's
 it's
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where


not
 everyone
 can
 just,
 you
 know,
 sit


around,
 be
 on
 a
 screen,
 invest
 for
 a


living,
 like
 this
 stuff
 is
 not
 real
 for


>> people
 in
 the
 chat
 are
 saying
 robot


maintenance.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 done
 by


robots.
 The
 same
 way
 that
 they're
 going


to
 walk
 to
 a
 charger
 and
 just
 sit
 down


and
 charge
 themselves,
 they're
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 do
 maintenance
 on
 themselves.


Eventually,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 robotic


surgeons.
 You
 already
 have
 it
 through


intuitive
 surgical.
 You
 just
 have
 a


human
 controlling
 it.
 You're
 telling
 me


that
 by
 2040
 or
 2045,
 you're
 not
 going


to
 have
 full
 robotic
 surgeries
 unmanned?


No,
 I
 mean
 and
 you
 know
 I
 see
 ISRG
 is


already
 working
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff


there.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things


that
 are
 happening
 right
 now
 that
 are


laying
 the
 framework
 to
 make
 this


happen.
 The
 the
 only
 answer
 most
 of
 us


can
 have
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 an
 answer


for
 what
 the
 world
 looks
 like
 is
 invest


in
 those
 companies.
 That's
 it.


>> Like
 if
 Amazon's
 going
 to
 lay
 off


600,000
 people,
 you
 got
 to
 have
 some


Amazon
 stock.


>> Yeah,
 but
 half
 of
 the
 freaking
 country


doesn't
 even
 own
 stock.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 get
 it.
 that
 there
 there's
 a


big
 problem
 right
 now
 and
 unfortunately


we're
 not
 in
 a
 situation
 to
 really


find
 our
 way
 out
 of
 it
 because


this
 is
 going
 to
 I
 hope
 I'm
 wrong.
 I


really
 hope
 I'm
 wrong,
 but
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 see
 how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 end
 with


an
 abundance
 of
 jobs
 and
 I
 don't
 know


how
 you're
 going
 to
 tax
 robots
 and
 how


that
 money
 is
 going
 to
 get
 dispersed.


Elon
 did
 say
 the
 cost
 of
 goods
 will
 go


down
 so
 dramatically
 that
 people
 won't


need
 as
 much
 money
 through
 deflation
 and


jobs
 are
 optional.


>> Okay.
 What
 about
 the
 cost
 of
 property?


The
 cost
 of
 doing
 things.
 Tell
 me
 all


that's
 just
 going
 to
 go
 down.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 see
 it.


>> I
 don't
 see
 it.


>> I
 do
 have
 optimism
 in
 humanity
 though.


Like
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 we


figure
 it
 out.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 already


we've
 always
 figured
 it
 out,
 right,
 as
 a


human
 species.


>> We've
 never
 seen
 anything
 like
 this


before.
 This
 is
 dramatically
 different


than
 the
 industrial
 revolution.


>> Well,
 and
 that
 that's
 a
 good
 point


because
 what
 this
 is
 doing
 is
 quite


literally
 creating
 intelligence


artificially.
 So
 like
 if
 the
 one
 thing


about
 humans
 that
 was
 always
 uh
 genuine


was
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 uh
 beings
 that


can
 think
 and
 reason.
 That's
 what


differentiates
 us
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 other


species.
 If
 that's
 replicated,


it
 takes
 away
 a
 lot
 of the
 specialness


of
 being
 a
 human.


And
 I
 mean,
 we
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 get


into
 the
 conversation
 of
 what
 that
 means


for
 relationships
 in
 the
 I
 mean,
 I


cannot
 believe
 that
 the
 tech
 companies


and
 Sam
 Alman
 are
 so
 focused
 on
 making


sure
 that
 people
 can
 have
 AI
 girlfriends


and
 boyfriends
 because
 I
 just
 like
 like


objectively
 we
 know
 that
 is
 going
 to


decrease
 the
 birth
 rate
 and


>> have
 they
 actually
 put
 that
 out
 yet?


>> Didn't
 we
 talk
 about
 Sam
 Alman
 literally


said
 we
 are
 coming
 out
 with
 a
 with
 a


quote
 unquote
 adult
 mode.


>> I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 joke.


>> No.
 and
 he
 said
 he
 firmly
 said
 we
 are


not
 the
 moral
 police
 of
 the
 world.
 We


>> there's
 a
 there
 was
 actually
 a
 study


yesterday
 that
 said
 a
 lot
 of
 there's


like
 2.4
 million
 queries
 a
 month
 on
 chat


that
 are
 explicitly
 rooted
 in
 people


talking
 about
 their
 depression.
 And
 so


OpenAI
 is
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 about


like
 how
 do
 we
 now
 like
 how
 do
 we
 manage


this
 AI
 talking
 to
 someone
 who's
 in
 a
 in


a
 horrible
 spot
 in
 their
 mind.
 Um,
 and


so
 because
 of
 that
 situation,
 Sam
 Alman


came
 out
 and
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to


create
 an
 adult
 mode
 and
 we're
 going
 to


try
 to
 create
 some
 restrictions
 on
 the


mental
 health
 stuff
 in
 the
 adult
 mode."


Basically
 admitting
 you
 can
 create
 this


character
 via
 Chat
 GBT
 and
 you
 can
 talk


to
 it
 however
 you
 want


and
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 stop
 it,


>> right?


>> Because
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 massive


engagement
 for
 the
 platform
 and
 they


need
 to
 turn
 a
 profit
 because
 they've


promised
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars


of
 revenue.
 So,


>> all
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 is
 it
 is
 going
 to
 get


even
 more
 socially
 awkward
 out
 there.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Oh,
 yeah.


>> That's
 scary.


Again,
 I
 think
 the
 only
 thing
 we
 all
 can


do
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 answers
 to


how
 this
 plays
 out
 is
 you
 got
 to
 own


some
 stock.
 You
 just
 have
 to.


You
 just
 have
 to.
 You
 got
 to
 own
 these


companies.


I
 mean,
 we've
 seen
 it
 over
 the
 past
 five


years,
 right?
 If
 you
 own
 assets,
 you've


done
 well.
 If
 you
 don't,
 it's
 really


tough.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 always
 been
 like
 that,


though.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's
 just
 now
 that
 stocks


have
 gone
 mainstream,
 you
 know,
 people


have
 really
 felt
 the
 people
 have
 really


felt
 the
 brutality
 of
 their
 neighbor


getting
 rich
 and
 them
 not.
 I
 I
 think


more
 ever
 in
 history,
 people
 have


started
 to
 feel,
 damn
 it,
 Johnny


invested
 in
 Nvidia.
 He
 was
 telling
 me


about
 it.
 I
 didn't
 really
 care
 about


learning
 about
 the
 stock
 market.
 And


now,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 living
 paycheck
 to


paycheck.
 This
 guy's
 freaking
 up
 80%
 in


a
 year.
 That
 [ __ ]
 hurt.


>> I
 I
 don't
 talk
 about
 stocks
 really


unless
 it's
 with
 you
 and
 Chris
 and
 Matt


and
 Tanner
 and
 the
 guys.
 Like,
 people


think
 I'm
 freaking
 nuts.
 Like,
 nobody


wants
 to
 talk
 about
 stocks
 or
 anything.


I
 don't
 understand
 why.


>> Dude,
 you're
 not
 the
 only
 one.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 the
 majority
 of
 us
 in
 this
 chat


come
 here
 every
 day
 because
 we
 don't


have
 people
 to
 talk
 to.
 And
 if
 we
 try,


dude,
 I
 texted
 my
 sister.
 So,
 I
 texted


my
 sister
 a
 screenshot
 of
 her
 Robin
 Hood


portfolio
 because
 she
 doesn't
 even
 check


it.


and
 uh
 she's
 up
 $93,000
 on
 Nvidia.
 She


has
 1,500
 shares
 at
 139
 that
 I
 bought


for
 her
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.


>> So
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 like
 you're
 up
 44%


93,000.


>> This
 was
 her
 response.


>> Cool.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 Nice.


>> It's
 like
 I
 showed
 her
 a
 cupcake
 or


something.
 She's
 like,
 "Wow,
 a
 cupcake."


Like,
 bro,
 that's
 almost
 a h
 100red


grand
 on
 a
 stock
 that
 she
 doesn't
 even


know
 what
 the
 hell
 they
 do.
 She's
 up


14,000
 today
 and
 she's
 like,


"Cool,
 whatever."


This
 is
 my
 point.
 It's
 like,
 if
 my
 own


sister
 who's
 up
 almost
 six
 figures
 on
 a


company
 she
 doesn't
 even
 know
 about,
 she


doesn't
 she's
 not
 she
 didn't
 ask
 me
 a


follow-up
 question.
 She
 didn't
 ask
 me


like,
 "Oh,
 cool.
 Like,
 what
 happened


today?
 Why
 are
 they
 up
 so
 much?"
 No,
 she


doesn't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 Like
 if
 if
 you're


up
 that
 much
 money
 and
 you
 still
 don't


care,
 I
 can't
 imagine
 someone
 who


doesn't
 have
 those
 gains.
 Why
 would
 they


care?


>> Money
 is
 not
 real.


>> Money
 is
 not
 real


>> until
 it
 is.
 Right.


>> Until
 it
 is.


It


>> It's
 crazy.
 people
 just


the
 point
 is
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 are
 here


because
 we
 know
 how
 important
 it
 is
 to


invest
 and
 in
 the
 next
 10
 years
 it
 might


be
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 to
 have


assets
 and
 allocation
 to
 assets.


It
 really
 might
 be
 the
 most
 important


thing.


>> How
 about
 this?
 It
 may
 be
 crazy
 to
 say


this.
 S&P
 10,000
 is
 coming
 sooner
 than


people
 think.


I'm
 gonna
 say
 it.
 I'm
 gonna
 say
 it.


>> So,


>> you
 went
 from
 7,000
 to
 7,200
 to
 Is
 that


there's
 a
 little
 a
 little
 spike
 in
 that


milk
 or
 something?
 What
 do
 we
 got
 10,000


in
 the
 year?
 Is
 that
 what
 we're
 doing?


>> Finish
 the
 milk.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 guys


and
 gals,
 I
 don't
 appreciate
 the


comments
 that
 I'm
 racist
 because
 I'm


drinking
 white
 milk.
 You
 know,


>> I
 agree
 with
 them
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 kind


of
 agree.


>> I
 drink
 chocolate
 milk
 half
 the
 time.


>> Yeah,
 but
 whenever
 it's
 on
 stream,
 it's


always
 white
 for


>> That's
 not
 true.
 That
 is
 absolutely
 not


true.
 On
 Saturday
 night,
 I
 had
 chocolate


milk
 with
 me.


>> Steve,
 you
 are
 now
 a
 public
 figure.


>> Your
 actions,
 your
 actions
 really


matter.


>> Listen,
 cho
 chocolate
 milk.
 I
 just


didn't
 feel
 like
 grabbing
 the
 chocolate


milk
 this
 time.


>> Or
 maybe
 you
 have
 a
 subliminal
 bias


towards
 an
 unconscious
 bias.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 You
 know
 what
 it
 is?


When
 you're
 eating
 a
 blueberry
 loaf,
 you


don't
 want
 chocolate
 milk.
 You
 want


regular
 milk.


But
 chocolate
 milk
 is
 freaking
 amazing.


But
 not
 when
 you're
 like
 when
 you're


whatever.


>> Wait,
 he
 said
 8,000
 this
 morning.
 What


have
 you
 been
 saying
 all
 day?


>> Not
 saying


all
 day.


>> Hold
 on.


>> I
 did
 not
 say
 8,000
 this
 morning.
 What
 I


was
 going
 to
 say


is


>> Yo,
 they're
 they're
 ratting
 on
 you.
 You


were
 saying
 a
 bunch
 of
 numbers
 all
 day.


>> I
 did
 not
 say
 8,000
 this
 morning.
 You


were
 with
 me
 this
 morning.


people.


>> I
 would
 I
 would
 remember
 saying
 8,000.


>> You
 probably
 said
 it.
 You
 forgot
 because


you're
 just
 throwing
 out
 all
 these


numbers
 all
 day
 now.
 You
 forgot.


>> I
 definitely
 didn't.


>> Okay.
 So
 10,000.
 Why?
 Uh


>> no.
 10,000
 20
 by
 2030.


>> So
 that
 would
 be
 that's
 five
 years.
 Four


years
 from
 now.


>> Four
 four
 years
 two
 months.


>> So
 that
 would
 be
 a
 42%
 move.


That's
 not
 even
 crazy.


Think
 about
 that.


>> Well,
 we
 given
 we've
 been
 having
 20%


moves
 for
 the
 past
 basically
 three


years,


>> right?
 That's
 not
 even
 crazy.


>> It's
 not
 that
 crazy.


>> I
 mean,
 can
 you
 believe
 that
 we
 we're


even
 going
 to
 have
 a
 discussion
 10,000


or
 not
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 decade?


>> By
 the
 way,
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 there's
 a


clip,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,


of
 Tom
 Lee
 saying
 15,000
 by
 by
 2030.
 I


mean
 that
 would
 be
 freaking
 ridiculous


if
 that
 happened.


>> Dude,
 I
 am
 pretty
 sure
 I
 remember
 this


clip.
 Tom
 Lee
 S&P
 15,000.


>> Every
 everybody
 who's
 been
 investing
 in


S&P
 index
 funds
 in
 their
 retirement
 be


so
 freaking
 happy
 over
 the
 next
 five


years.


>> I
 I
 have
 it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 people


would
 be
 very
 happy
 if
 that
 is
 how
 it


plays
 out.


>> Previously
 predicted
 that
 the
 S&P
 would


reach
 15,000
 by
 20.
 Have
 you
 moderated


it
 in
 any
 way?
 If
 so,
 how?
 And
 what
 are


some
 of
 the
 key
 drivers
 that
 support


your
 forecast?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 um
 yeah,
 that's
 still
 our


case.
 You
 know,
 our
 base
 case
 by
 2030,


we
 estimate
 S&P
 earnings
 could
 be
 600
 to


650.
 And
 I
 think
 multiples
 will
 be


higher
 because
 of
 the
 larger
 share


coming
 from
 AI
 and
 technology
 earnings,


which
 naturally
 have
 higher
 PE


multiples.
 And
 so,
 if
 you
 just
 apply
 a


20
 to
 25
 multiple,
 you're
 getting


you
 know,
 15,000.
 So,
 I
 I
 know
 it
 sounds


like
 people
 say,
 "Well,
 15,000
 sounds


crazy."
 And
 two
 years
 ago,
 it
 might
 have


sounded
 crazy,
 even
 though
 we
 we
 had


that
 forecast
 was
 in
 place
 more
 than
 two


years
 ago.
 You
 know,
 that
 forecast
 been


in
 place
 probably
 for
 five
 or
 six
 years,


but,
 you
 know,
 now
 that
 we're
 at
 6,000,


we're
 that
 much
 closer
 to
 um
 15,000.


It's
 not
 a
 quantum
 leap
 any,
 you
 know,


any
 longer.
 You've
 pre


>> You're
 not
 You're
 not
 as
 bullish
 as
 Tom.


Steve,


>> do
 I
 need
 to
 go
 125?


>> Dude,
 we
 can
 only
 get
 away
 with
 a
 conver


we
 can
 only
 get
 away
 with
 a
 conversation


like
 this
 when
 Nvidia
 hits
 alltime
 highs


and
 we
 have
 a
 green
 day.
 Otherwise,
 if


we
 were
 having
 this
 conversation
 and
 any


other
 everyone
 in
 the
 chat
 would
 be
 like


these
 [ __ ]
 dumb
 asses
 going
 back
 and


forth
 about
 15,000
 20
 Only
 on
 a
 day
 like


this
 is
 it
 somewhat
 listenable.


>> Only
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this.
 By
 the
 way,


your
 dairy
 dealers
 in
 the
 chat.


>> Yeah.
 And
 he's
 lying.


>> You've
 never
 bought


>> I
 have
 the
 I
 have
 the
 chocolate
 milk
 in


the
 fridge.
 Do
 I
 need
 to
 go
 get
 it?


>> Like
 I
 legitimately
 have
 it.


>> You
 never
 show
 it
 on
 stream.
 It's
 just


always
 the
 white
 one.
 Of
 course
 I
 do.


Siege,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat.


Cool.
 Same
 thing
 my
 sister
 said.


Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as


well.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 yeah,
 agree.
 A
 week


ago,
 no
 one
 was
 talking
 like
 this,
 but


things
 change
 in
 a
 week.
 When
 Jensen
 ups


his
 estimates
 by
 100
 billion,
 you
 know,


it
 can
 change
 stuff.


>> I
 don't
 even
 know what
 to
 say
 anymore.


This
 pretty
 crazy.


Well,
 look,
 I'm
 happy
 I
 own
 Nvidia.
 I'm


happy
 you
 own
 Nvidia.
 I'm
 happy
 we
 both


bought
 as
 much
 as
 we
 could.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 bought
 derivative


plays
 from
 Nvidia.
 Today's
 news
 was


really
 important
 for
 all
 that.


>> I
 have
 a
 question
 for
 you.
 What
 are
 you


doing
 tonight?


>> Nothing.
 Today's
 Tuesday.


>> So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 an
 impromptu
 stream


tonight
 and
 I
 got
 Chef
 Paul
 coming
 on.


If
 you
 would
 like
 to
 talk
 about
 stakes


with
 us,
 you're
 more
 than
 welcome.


I
 will
 listen
 in
 the
 chat
 to
 hear
 you


guys
 talk
 about
 how
 you
 shouldn't
 cook
 a


steak
 because
 I
 know
 that
 medium
 well
 in


my
 perspective
 is
 not
 really


>> Yeah,
 but
 you
 had
 medium
 when
 we
 went
 to


Uncle
 Jackson.
 I
 think
 you
 liked
 it.


>> I
 did.
 I
 mean,
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 medium


rare.
 So,


>> that
 was
 not
 medium
 rare,
 sir.
 That
 was


medium.


>> No,
 it
 was
 medium
 rare.
 We
 We
 both


looked
 It
 was
 medium
 rare.


>> Mine
 was
 medium.
 So
 was
 yours.


This
 is
 not
 medium,
 bro.


This
 is
 not
 medium.
 What
 are
 you
 talking


about?


>> Medium.


>> It's
 not
 medium.
 Look
 at
 all
 that
 pink.


>> Yeah,
 pink.
 That
 looks
 delicious.


>> It
 was
 delicious.
 It
 was
 good.


>> It
 was
 delicious.


>> No,
 but
 I
 I
 I'll
 listen
 today.
 I'll
 hear


what
 you
 guys
 have
 to
 say.
 I
 don't
 think


I
 can
 actually
 make
 the
 stream,
 but


>> Yeah,
 it's
 up
 to
 you.


>> Is
 this
 a
 Who's
 What
 chef
 is
 this?
 This


is
 your
 uh


>> Chef
 Paul.


>> This
 is
 like
 your
 your
 friend.
 Who's
 a


chef?


>> Chef
 Paul.


So,
 what
 are
 you
 gonna
 ask,


>> dude?
 You
 can
 talk
 about
 liquor
 stores.


He
 used
 to
 own
 a
 liquor
 store.
 He's
 a


chef.
 Interesting
 guy.


>> You
 should
 ask
 him
 how
 many
 people
 ask


for
 medium
 well
 over
 medium
 rare.


>> I
 will
 absolutely
 ask
 him
 that.


>> And
 I
 feel
 like
 his
 response
 might


surprise
 you
 because
 I'm
 not
 alone
 in


this.


>> Oh,
 he's
 gonna
 freaking
 I
 I
 gotta
 tell


you,
 he
 was
 roasting
 me
 the
 other
 day


because
 I
 we
 were
 talking.
 It
 was
 like


11:30
 in
 the
 morning.
 Like,
 man,
 you


know
 what
 would
 be
 good
 right
 now?


Cappuccino.
 He's
 like,
 cappuccino.


He's
 like,
 the
 only
 time
 anything
 after


11:00
 a.m.
 you
 drink
 espresso.
 Like,


he's
 freaking
 crazy.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 still
 don't
 think
 medium


rare
 is
 legit,
 but


I
 guess
 that's
 what
 the
 majority
 of
 the


world
 eats.
 I'm
 not
 vegetarian.


>> He's
 not
 a
 vegetarian.
 And
 I
 will,
 this


is
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 everybody.
 So,


we're
 sitting
 there
 freaking
 lunch.
 We


both
 order
 appetizers.
 Both
 order


steaks.
 Oh,


>> no.
 You
 ordered
 an
 appetizer.
 I
 didn't


have
 an
 app.
 You
 had
 You
 had
 the


>> You
 order
 mac
 and
 cheese.
 What are
 you


talking
 about?


>> That's
 not
 an
 appetude.
 That's
 what
 you


eat
 with
 a
 steak.


>> That's
 an
 appetizer.


>> No,
 I
 ate
 it
 with
 the
 steak.
 I
 don't
 eat


>> No,
 but
 that's
 an
 appetizer.
 We
 got
 the


garlic
 mash
 to
 go
 with
 the
 steak.


>> Anyway,


>> I
 mean
 that
 as
 a
 side,
 not
 an
 appetizer,


but
 that's


>> Anyway,
 you
 ordered
 the


mac
 and
 cheese.
 You
 ate
 half
 your
 steak


and
 then
 you
 wanted
 to
 get
 two
 desserts.


Like
 you
 legitimately
 wanted
 to
 get
 two


desserts.
 And
 I
 bet
 you
 would
 have


finished
 both
 of
 them.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 get
 two
 desserts
 because
 I


thought
 we
 would
 each
 have
 dessert.


>> It
 was
 I
 I
 can't
 do
 dessert
 during
 the


day.


>> So
 I
 picked
 the
 chocolate
 cake
 over
 the


uh
 the
 tiramisu
 and
 it
 was
 delicious.


And
 I
 finished
 it
 way
 quicker
 than
 I


finished
 my
 steak.
 That's
 for
 sure.


>> I
 used
 to
 be
 like
 that.


Uncle
 Jack
 is
 legit,
 dude.
 It
 was
 a


really
 good


>> So
 good.


>> I
 I
 I
 felt
 it
 was
 better
 than
 Ben
 and


Jack.
 I'm
 sorry.
 That
 steak
 was


>> 100%.


>> Yeah.
 Typical
 child
 behavior.


>> 100%.


It's
 just
 so
 far
 from
 my
 office,
 but
 it


is
 so
 worth
 the
 walk.
 It
 is
 so
 good.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 far.
 I
 didn't
 know
 it
 was


that
 far
 from
 you.
 Like
 you
 had
 to
 walk


a
 minute
 to
 get
 there.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 a
 good
 20
 25
 minute
 walk.


All
 right.
 So,


uh,
 Nvidia


200s.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 if
 it
 falls
 below


200
 tomorrow,
 which
 of
 course
 is


possible,
 it's
 it'll
 be
 like
 whatever,


but
 if
 it


>> Who's
 How
 about
 this?
 Who's
 reporting


tomorrow?


>> All
 the
 companies
 that
 buy
 from
 Nvidia,


>> right?


>> So,
 you
 know,
 to
 be
 honest,
 that's


probably
 another
 reason
 why
 it
 ran
 today


because
 everyone's
 anticipating
 all


them.


>> They're
 trying
 to
 frontr
 run
 it.


>> They're
 trying
 like
 I
 didn't
 even
 think


of
 that.
 Yeah,
 that's
 a
 basic
 reason
 for


why
 they
 ran.


How
 about
 Nvidia
 could
 be
 220
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 week?


>> Okay,
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 spiked
 your
 milk


with
 all
 this
 bullish
 moment.
 Like,
 I


get
 it.
 It
 was
 a
 good
 day.
 But
 that


would
 imply


uh
 $350
 billion
 in
 market
 cap
 added,


>> right?
 And
 they
 added
 freaking
 It's
 up


how
 much
 today?
 10
 bucks.
 How
 much


market
 cap
 did
 they
 add
 today?


>> Uh
 240.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you
 tell
 me
 in
 three
 more
 days


they
 can't
 add
 another
 freaking
 three


>> 360.


>> Think
 about
 it.


>> 360
 plus


>> we
 haven't
 even
 heard


>> 600
 billion
 added
 in
 a
 week
 bro.


>> I
 mean
 admit
 think
 about
 it.


Jasse


and
 Sindar
 have
 been
 radio
 silent.


Radio
 silence.


>> What?
 You
 think
 they're
 going
 to


announce
 something
 big?


How
 don't
 they


think
 about
 it?
 Zuck
 comes
 out
 with
 27


billion
 data
 center.
 Open
 AI
 comes
 out


with
 the
 26
 gigawatts
 of
 freaking
 chips.


Microsoft
 comes
 out
 with
 this


announcement.


How
 what
 are
 they
 going
 to
 do?
 Not


announce
 anything.


>> That's
 true.
 They
 haven't
 really
 made
 a


deal
 with
 You're
 right.
 They
 haven't


said
 much
 with
 Google.


Dude,
 that's
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 Nvidia's


partnered
 with
 all
 these
 companies
 and


they
 haven't
 really
 announced
 something


with
 Google
 yet,
 then


maybe
 that's
 what's
 gonna
 happen.


>> Pretty
 crazy.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 Pretty


incredible
 day.


And
 hopefully
 this
 can
 continue.

 And


also
 seeking
 Alpha
 I'm
 putting
 in
 the


chat.
 He
 did
 a
 SoFi
 article.
 So
 for


those
 that
 are
 interested
 in
 that


can
 read
 that.


>> I'm
 actually
 interested
 if
 people


actually
 want
 to
 read
 the
 article.
 I'm


interested
 what
 people
 think
 because


this
 is
 the
 first
 time
 I
 really
 did
 a


deep
 dive
 on
 the
 financial
 services


productivity
 loop.
 And


it's
 it's
 interesting.


milk.


>> Look
 at
 this.
 Gavin
 Newsome
 is
 furious.


Joe
 Rogan
 won't
 have
 him
 on.
 Uh,
 okay.


Wait,
 Joe
 Rogan
 said
 he
 he
 won't
 have


Gavin
 Newsome
 on


>> Oh,
 there's
 beef
 with
 it.
 You
 didn't
 see


him
 talking
 to
 Ken
 about
 it?


>> No.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


Gavin
 Newsome
 just
 called
 Rogan
 the


Facebook
 of
 podcasting.


>> What?
 Yeah,


it
 was
 on
 CNN.
 Oh,
 hold
 on.
 I
 got
 I
 got


the
 clip.
 I
 got
 to
 see
 the
 clip.
 By
 the


way,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 FNG


says,
 "Milk
 to
 Steve
 is
 like
 open
 AI
 to


the
 market."
 I
 can't
 disagree
 with
 that.


I
 can't


>> disagree
 with
 what?


>> Milk
 to
 Steve
 is
 like
 opening
 eyes
 to


the
 market.


>> Dude,
 I
 got
 milk
 run
 through
 the
 veins.


>> He
 won't
 Look,
 he
 hasn't
 for
 years
 and


years.
 He's
 been
 attacking
 me
 and
 it's


one
 way
 and
 he
 won't
 have
 me
 on.
 He's


consistently
 not
 have
 me
 on.
 By
 the
 way,


I'm
 moving
 on.
 I
 have
 no
 interest.
 I


>> You're
 done
 with
 him.
 Joe
 Rogan's
 the


Facebook
 of
 podcasting.


>> He
 was
 sitting
 across
 one
 of
 the
 the
 the


brightest
 minds
 in
 podcasting
 right
 now.


>> The
 guy
 was
 in
 the
 mic


>> and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 at
 the
 mic


doing
 extraordinary
 things.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 in
 podcast,


>> Phil
 Rogan's
 got
 pretty
 big
 audience


still.


>> You
 know
 what,
 but
 with
 all
 due
 respect,


if
 he's


>> if
 he
 has
 a
 big
 audience
 and
 he
 but
 he


doesn't
 have
 big
 enough
 confidence,
 I


didn't
 go
 there
 to
 have
 me
 on.


>> Well,
 you've
 called
 him
 a
 chicken.
 But


he's
 been
 attacking
 for
 but
 here's
 the


thing.
 These
 guys,
 they
 all
 have


something
 in
 common.
 It's
 one
 way
 they


attack,
 they
 belittle,
 they
 demean,
 they


take
 things
 out
 of
 context.
 But
 this
 is


a
 serious
 thing.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 often
 we
 just
 sit
 back
 and
 go,


"Oh
 god,
 I
 really
 would
 love
 to
 go
 on."


Oh,
 if
 Kla
 Harris
 just
 went
 on
 Joe


Rogan,
 she
 would
 have
 won.
 It's
 not
 It's


so
 much
 deeper
 than
 that.
 And
 the


unwillingness
 for
 a
 guy
 like
 that
 to


even
 have
 the
 common
 courtesy
 to
 attack


someone
 and
 not
 have
 the
 DC
 say,
 "You


know what?
 Why
 don't
 you
 have
 a
 chance


to
 come
 on?
 Let's
 have
 a
 civil
 dialogue.


I've
 watched
 you
 on
 on
 podcast
 with
 like


Sean
 Ryan
 who's
 a
 close
 buddy
 of
 this.


He
 had
 the
 curse
 on
 me
 have
 four
 hours,


right?
 Sean
 Hannity,
 folks
 like
 that.


And
 so
 if
 I
 can
 go
 on
 Sean
 Ryan
 and
 Sean


Hannity,
 what
 are
 you
 worried
 about?


What
 are
 you
 Joe?
 You're
 going
 to
 cook


me
 or
 I'm
 going
 to
 cook
 myself.


>> You
 need
 find
 the
 clip
 with
 what
 Rogan


said.
 That'll
 blow
 you
 away.


>> I
 mean,
 they're
 probably
 going
 to
 go


back
 and
 forth.


I
 think
 I
 have
 the
 clip
 that
 Rogan
 has


said.
 Dude,
 the
 thing
 is
 it's
 either


going
 to
 be
 Newsome
 or
 AOC
 for
 2028.
 I


really
 don't
 know
 who
 else
 the
 Democrats


can
 put
 up.
 And
 obviously
 Newsome
 thinks


it's
 going
 to
 be
 him.
 So


>> it's
 it's
 going to
 be
 Newsome,
 right?


Like
 that's
 like
 there's
 no
 one
 like


>> I
 don't
 know
 who
 else
 they
 could


possibly


put
 up
 there.


If
 I
 had
 a
 handicap,
 it
 gonna
 be
 Newsome


and
 it's
 gonna
 be
 JD
 Vance.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 don't
 have
 any
 faith
 in
 Gavin


Newsome.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> Which
 is
 kind
 of
 funny
 cuz
 he
 wants
 to


be
 president
 so
 bad.


>> That's
 what
 that's
 true
 what
 it
 looks


like.


>> You
 can't
 ruin
 a
 city
 and
 then
 go
 on
 to


ruin
 a
 state
 and
 say,
 "Guys,
 that
 was


just
 practice.
 Once
 I
 get
 it
 as
 a


president,
 I'm
 going
 to
 fix
 it.
 Fix
 it


all."


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 so
 crazy.
 But
 he's
 such
 a


great
 politician.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 so


smooth.
 You
 think
 so?


>> No.
 No.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 he's
 terrible.


How's
 he
 remained
 in
 power
 for
 so
 long?


>> Low
 competition.


>> There's
 no
 one
 who's
 good
 is
 competing


against
 him.
 There's
 no
 sincerity.


>> I
 should
 say
 he's
 not
 a
 good
 I
 should


say
 smooth.
 He
 comes
 back.


>> I
 mean,
 he's
 a
 good
 [ __ ]
 artist.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 what
 I
 mean.


>> But
 it's
 like
 what
 the
 things
 that
 he


says
 when
 he
 gets
 confronted
 with
 you.


We
 have
 the
 high
 highest
 this
 and
 the


highest
 that.
 Like
 everybody's
 leaving.


You
 have
 the
 highest
 unemployment.
 You


have
 the
 highest
 homelessness.


>> Hollywood.


>> Money's
 missing.
 You
 killed
 Hollywood.


Like
 Hollywood
 doesn't
 exist
 anymore.


It's
 literally
 gone.
 They
 mandated


vaccines
 for
 kids
 that
 didn't
 need
 them.


You
 guys,
 he
 did
 horrible
 [ __ ]
 They


don't
 have
 any


>> What
 I
 find
 interesting
 about
 it
 is


>> I
 would
 personally
 like
 to
 see
 the


conversation
 because
 Rogan
 left


California.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,


>> that's
 true.
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 a
 very


important
 conversation
 given


>> I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 the
 the


conversation.


I
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 Newsome


or
 AOC
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 running
 for


2028
 for
 the
 Democrats.
 I
 just
 got
 Devin


Ryan
 Sofi
 report
 after
 earnings.
 Dude,


this
 guy
 is
 so
 scared
 to
 give
 a
 price


target


price
 target.
 NA


>> more


>> I
 really
 respect
 him
 as
 an
 analyst.
 He


gave
 SB
 a
 $50
 target.
 You
 can't
 give


SoFi
 a
 target.


That's
 weird,
 bro.
 This
 goes
 to
 Tanner's


point
 that
 the
 institutional
 guys,
 they


hate
 SoFi.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 he
 hates
 SoFi.


He's
 bullish,
 but
 like
 he
 can't
 put
 his


name
 associated
 with
 a
 number,
 which
 is


not
 that
 hard
 to
 do
 if
 you
 just
 project


their
 earnings
 because
 they
 don't
 want


to
 be
 accountable
 for
 a
 number.


But
 it's
 this
 type
 of
 stuff
 that's
 like


it's
 it's
 it's
 hard
 sometimes
 for
 SoFi


to
 catch
 a
 bid
 when
 these
 guys
 just


can't
 tell
 their
 clients,
 hey,
 we
 think


it's
 going
 to
 50.
 Buy
 it.


But
 it
 looks
 like
 he's
 pretty
 bullish


after.


I
 mean,
 how
 could
 you
 not
 be
 after
 that


report?


>> I
 I
 I
 really
 thought
 he
 didn't
 have
 a


price
 target
 since
 18.
 I
 thought
 finally


he
 would
 put
 up
 a
 price
 target,


>> but
 you
 don't
 have
 it.


All
 right,
 that
 is
 it.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 Steve
 will


be
 streaming
 at
 night,
 so
 you
 can
 check


him
 out
 on
 his
 stream.
 And


yeah,
 tomorrow
 will
 be
 a
 big
 day,
 guys.


I'll
 be
 live
 the
 whole
 day.
 Um
 market


open.
 We're
 gonna
 have
 some
 guests
 join


the
 show.


before
 FOMC
 FOMC
 at
 2:30
 and
 then
 at
 4


p.m.
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 madness.
 Like
 it


is
 going
 to
 be
 absolute
 madness
 with


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Google


and
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 these
 guys


can
 really
 put
 up
 the
 numbers.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 Redcat


CEO
 will
 be
 on.
 I
 think
 Chad
 from


Palanter
 will
 be
 on
 as
 well.
 I
 think


we'll
 have
 a
 couple
 people
 that
 hop
 on.


All right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Congrats
 to
 everyone.


Great
 day.
 Nvidia,
 really
 nice
 to
 see


the
 Palenteer
 Partnership.
 Overall,


Nvidia
 increasing
 these
 projections,


helping
 the
 entire
 sector
 20389.


And
 now
 we
 just
 got
 to
 get
 these


earnings
 and
 hopefully
 a
 rate
 cut


tomorrow
 to
 keep
 this
 going.


>> All
 right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 See
 you
 tomorrow


everyone.
 Uh
 probably
 900
 PM
 I'll


probably
 be
 going
 on.
 So,


>> all
 right.
 Bye
 everybody.


>> Later
 everyone.
