Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Wednesday,


October
 15th
 and
 well,
 we're
 green.
 We


are
 green
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Past
 24


hours
 have
 been
 quite
 hilarious
 given


yesterday
 we
 had
 a
 1.5%
 draw
 down
 for


about
 20
 minutes
 and
 then
 we
 started


reversing.
 didn't
 know
 if
 we
 would
 fully


recover
 all
 of
 the
 essentially
 market


cap
 that
 we
 lost
 which
 was
 about
 500


billion
 and
 we
 recovered
 and
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 five
 minutes
 before
 I


went
 live
 for
 the
 market
 close
 yesterday


we
 were
 pretty
 much
 green
 to
 go
 and
 then


we
 ended
 up
 getting
 the
 tweet
 and


everyone
 who
 has
 kept
 up
 with
 the


channel
 or
 just
 kept
 up
 with
 the
 market


over
 the
 past
 24
 hours
 knows
 what
 the


tweet
 is.
 We
 got
 the
 soybean
 tweet
 and


it
 kind
 of
 messed
 up
 the
 end
 of
 the
 the


day.
 Uh
 you
 had
 Trump
 saying
 that
 I


think
 China
 is
 purposely
 not
 buying
 our


soybeans.
 As
 a
 result,
 we
 are
 going
 to


stop
 buying
 their
 cooking
 oil.
 Cooking


oil
 uh
 for
 China
 is
 a
 big
 business.
 The


United
 States
 makes
 up
 43%


of
 the
 amount
 of
 cooking
 oil
 that
 they


export
 globally.
 So
 obviously
 it's
 a
 big


thing
 for
 China
 if
 Trump
 were
 to
 say


that
 the
 United
 States
 would
 stop
 buying


their
 cooking
 oil.
 And
 then
 the
 market


fell
 and
 it
 didn't
 have
 a
 dramatic
 fall,


but
 nonetheless
 it
 did,
 you
 know,
 didn't


fully
 recover.
 Didn't
 close
 at
 the
 highs


that
 it
 was
 at
 yesterday.
 We
 were
 at


665,
 went
 all
 the
 way
 to
 662.
 We
 started


at
 653,
 so
 it
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 weird
 to


end
 out
 the
 day
 for
 him
 to
 put
 out
 that


tweet.


Today,
 the
 market
 doesn't
 care
 about


soybeans.
 S&P
 500
 up
 1%
 in
 the


pre-market,
 66744.
 Robin
 Hood's
 up
 2%.


Pounder's
 up
 1%.
 Tesla's
 up
 1%.
 Nvidia,


which
 got
 a
 brand
 new
 price
 target
 of


320
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about.
 That's
 up


184,
 2.3%.
 Grabb's
 up
 3%.
 Google's
 up


1%.
 SoFi
 is
 up
 3%.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 almost


like
 soybeans
 had
 an
 impact
 for
 like


less
 than
 I
 would
 call
 it
 12
 hours.
 And


I
 mean,
 the
 S&P
 is
 only
 about
 a
 percent


and
 a
 half
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs
 and


we
 were
 just
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 on
 Friday


when
 we
 lost
 it
 with
 the
 Trump
 China


stuff.
 So,
 pretty
 incredible
 stuff
 to


see
 over
 the
 past
 uh
 essentially
 24


hours.
 But
 the
 soybeans
 that
 did
 create


the
 pain
 for
 like
 12
 hours
 are
 not


creating
 that
 much
 pain
 too
 much,
 at


least
 not
 anymore.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to


talk
 about.
 We'll
 get
 into
 it,
 but
 I


think
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 first
 thing
 to


start
 us
 off,
 which
 is
 that
 whatever


pain
 that
 was
 caused
 yesterday
 by
 the


soybeans
 seems
 like
 the
 market's


ignoring
 it.
 Now,
 maybe
 it's
 a
 head
 fake


when
 we
 get
 into
 the
 market
 open,
 but
 as


of
 now,
 you're
 seeing
 some
 pretty


bullish
 green
 action,
 and
 there's


reasons
 for
 why
 we're
 seeing
 that
 green


action
 that
 we'll
 get
 into.
 The
 banks,


they
 crushed
 it.
 Bank
 of
 America,
 Morgan


Stanley,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 It


doesn't
 look
 like
 the
 banks
 are
 slowing


down.
 There
 are
 more
 data
 center
 deals.


Black
 Rockck
 entered
 into
 a
 $40
 billion


agreement
 with
 uh
 Nvidia
 and
 Microsoft


today.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 the
 implications


of
 that
 on
 data
 centers.
 IN
 that
 stock


continues
 to
 just
 be
 a
 fantastic
 stock.


Uh
 7360.
 It
 did
 hit
 74
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 It
 looks
 like
 it
 wants
 to


bust
 through
 75.
 So
 this
 one
 has
 been


incredible.
 Bit
 Barnes,
 CleanSpark,
 all


those
 data
 center
 plays
 have
 done
 very


well.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 what
 JPAL
 said


yesterday.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 what


JPAL
 said,
 which
 quite
 frankly
 is


probably
 more
 important
 than
 soybeans.


Uh
 essentially
 he
 said
 hey
 we
 are
 going


to
 get
 back
 to
 quantitative
 easing
 or
 at


least
 we're
 not
 going to
 be
 quantitative


tightening
 as
 hard
 as
 were
 before
 and
 as


a
 result
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 if
 rates
 are


coming
 down
 and
 the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to
 be


buying
 up
 bonds
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet


then
 you
 know
 that's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


worst
 thing
 for
 the
 equity
 markets.
 So


that's
 what
 we
 got
 going
 on.
 We
 got
 a


lot
 to
 get
 into.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Good
 morning.


Good
 morning.
 Good
 morning.
 Buy
 puts
 on


soybeans.
 Yeah.
 Imagine
 getting


liquidated
 yesterday
 over
 cooking
 oil
 or


soybeans.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 it
 was


ridiculous
 what
 was
 happening
 yesterday,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 the
 market


cares
 that
 much
 about
 it
 anymore,
 and


that
 is
 not
 too
 bad
 of
 a
 thing.
 All


right,
 so
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Again,
 good


morning.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 I
 think
 we'll
 start
 off
 with
 um
 I


think
 we'll
 start
 off
 with
 some
 of
 this


data.
 So,
 actually,
 let's
 start
 off
 with


the
 banks.
 The
 banks
 honestly
 just


continue
 to
 crush
 it
 and
 and
 they're


crushing
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 quite


unprecedented.
 So,
 let
 me
 just
 play
 a


clip
 right
 here
 of
 Morgan
 Stanley
 and


their
 earnings
 and
 how
 the
 banks
 or
 at


least
 the
 trend
 of
 what
 the
 banks
 are


doing.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 had
 their
 best


beat
 on
 earnings
 since
 2021.
 It
 is
 not


easy
 to
 put
 up
 these
 types
 of
 numbers,


but
 nonetheless,
 that's
 what
 they
 did.


It's
 a
 35%
 EPS
 and
 well,
 the
 streets


liking
 it
 because
 if
 the
 banks
 are
 doing


well,
 tech
 companies
 are
 probably
 going


to
 do
 well
 as
 we
 get
 into
 earnings
 going


into
 next
 week.


Yeah,
 I
 am
 seeing
 a
 beat
 here.
 the


biggest
 revenue
 beat
 it
 looks
 like
 since


Q1
 of
 21.
 Uh
 so
 about
 4
 and
 a
 half
 years


of
 18.2
 billion
 on
 the
 top
 line
 compared


to
 estimates
 of
 16.69


billion.
 So
 that's
 record
 net
 revenues


for
 Q3
 for
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 Also
 a
 beat


on
 the
 bottom
 line
 coming
 in
 about
 70


cents
 higher
 than
 consensus
 here.
 Uh
 all


three
 of
 its
 major
 divisions
 beat


expectations
 largely
 by
 a
 long
 shot.


institutional
 securities.
 That's
 the
 one


that
 houses
 M&A
 advisory,
 equity


underwriting,
 debt
 underwriting,


trading,
 and
 so
 forth.
 That
 was
 a
 a
 very


sizable
 beat,
 more
 than
 a
 billion


dollars
 uh
 compared
 to
 what
 the
 street


was
 expecting
 here.
 Uh
 investment


banking
 was
 up
 44%


um
 coming
 in
 at
 2.1
 billion.
 Advisory,


equity
 underwriting,
 fixed
 income


underwriting,
 all
 beating
 expectations


and
 much
 much
 higher
 than
 a
 year
 ago
 as


well.
 Uh
 the


I
 mean
 this
 was
 just
 one
 of
 the
 most


incredible
 bank
 earnings
 that
 I've
 ever


seen.
 So
 Bank
 of
 America
 crushed
 it
 as


well.
 Uh
 they
 beat
 on
 EPS
 106
 versus
 95


cents,
 28
 billion
 versus
 27.4
 and
 then


Morgan
 Stanley
 280
 versus
 207.
 I
 mean


banks
 don't
 beat
 by
 35%.
 That
 is
 not


normal
 for
 a
 bank.
 It's
 a
 bank
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day.
 This
 is
 a
 bank
 that's


beating
 by
 almost
 40%
 on
 earnings.
 And


then
 18.2
 billion
 versus
 16.7,
 that's
 a


$ 1.5
 billion
 beat
 on
 revenue.
 Yeah.


Imagine
 SoFi.
 I
 mean,
 if
 these
 banks


that
 are
 legacy
 banks
 that
 are
 not


growing
 anywhere
 near
 the
 40%
 range
 that


SoFi
 did
 last
 quarter,
 I
 think
 the


analysts
 have
 them
 at
 30%.
 If
 they
 come


in
 at
 35%
 in
 Q3,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 massive


beat,
 much
 less
 if
 they
 come
 back
 in
 at


40%.
 That
 would
 be
 two
 quarters
 in
 a
 row


of
 above
 40.
 Um,
 this
 is
 pretty


incredible
 stuff
 to
 see.
 Wells
 Fargo,
 JP


Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 City
 Group,
 and


Black
 Rockck
 yesterday
 also
 kept
 up
 with


the
 same.
 So,
 what
 is
 the
 takeaway
 for


investors?
 Even
 if
 you're
 not
 invested


in
 banks,
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important


thing
 to
 start
 off
 Q3
 earnings
 was,
 hey,


are
 financials
 in
 a
 healthy
 spot?
 Are


loan
 dispersals
 in
 a
 healthy
 spot?
 Is


capital
 spending,
 M&A,
 IPO,


underwriting,
 delinquency
 rates?
 Are
 all


these
 things
 healthy?
 And
 these
 stocks,


all
 of
 them
 are
 up
 20
 to
 30%
 on
 the


year.
 So
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 stock
 price


might
 not
 uh
 dramatically
 go
 higher


simply
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 growth
 is


priced
 in.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 these
 stock


prices
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 lower
 even
 if


the
 growth
 is
 priced
 in.
 And
 if


anything,
 they
 have
 the
 potential
 for


multiple
 expansion.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 I


think
 was
 up
 3%.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 up


3.92%.
 Bank
 of
 America
 I
 think
 was


actually
 up
 5%.
 BA
 now
 up
 3.83%.


So
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 really
 good
 to
 see.
 We


get
 into
 tech
 earnings
 next
 week.
 We
 did


have
 ASML
 which
 had
 a
 decent
 earnings.
 I


don't
 think
 it
 was
 a
 phenomenal


earnings.
 That
 stock
 right
 there
 is
 up


about
 four
 and a
 half%.
 There
 were
 a


couple
 things
 they
 missed
 on
 but
 overall


demand
 for
 semiconductors
 and


lithography
 seems
 to
 be
 strong.
 So
 we'll


talk
 more
 about
 that
 in
 a
 bit.
 But
 uh


the
 tech
 earnings
 next
 week
 are
 going
 to


be
 some
 of the
 most
 important
 earnings


and
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 the
 banks
 are


giving
 any
 you
 know
 uh
 necessity
 to


think
 that
 there
 is
 an
 issue
 in
 the


overall
 financial
 health
 of
 the
 broader


markets.
 And
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 for


the
 banks.
 Seems
 like
 they're
 doing


okay.
 Uh
 let's
 talk
 about
 Nvidia
 real


quick
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 some
 of


the
 other
 headlines
 we
 have.
 So
 Nvidia


got
 upgraded
 by
 HSBC
 to
 a
 street
 high


200
 to
 320.
 It's
 quite
 a
 move.
 200
 to


320.
 And
 the
 reason
 they
 got
 upgraded
 to


that
 extent,
 remember
 Caner
 upgraded


Nvidia
 uh
 to
 300
 last
 week
 from
 240.
 So


there
 is
 now
 a
 new
 street
 high
 target.


The
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 because
 of
 the


overall
 TAM
 for
 their
 revenues
 and
 what


the
 street
 thinks
 it
 can
 put
 up.
 So


instead
 of
 doing
 258
 billion
 by
 fiscal


year
 2027,
 HSB
 says
 HSBC
 thinks
 that
 we


can
 do
 351


billion
 of
 revenues
 for
 Nvidia.
 That
 is


36%
 higher
 than
 the
 expectations.
 And


you
 had
 Caner
 last
 week
 say,
 "We
 think


they
 can
 do
 $11
 of
 EPS,"
 which
 would
 be


um
 50%
 higher
 than
 the
 expectations.
 So,


I
 mean,
 320
 sounds
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 That


would
 be
 a
 $7.5
 trillion
 company.
 But
 to


put
 some
 context
 of
 the
 numbers,
 if


Nvidia
 gets
 to
 $1
 of
 EPS
 by
 2027
 and
 351


billions
 of
 revenues
 by
 2027,
 they'd


only
 be
 trading
 at
 27
 times
 forward


earnings
 and
 21
 times
 forward
 price
 of


sales.
 Right
 now
 the
 stock
 is
 more


expensive
 than
 both
 of
 those
 metrics
 on


a
 price
 of
 sales
 and
 a
 PE
 basis
 which


means
 theoretically
 if
 the
 stock
 were
 to


go
 up
 from
 180
 to
 to
 320.
 It
 would
 get


cheaper
 because
 the
 growth
 would
 be
 so


substantial
 that
 the
 growth
 would


actually
 bring
 down
 the
 multiple
 even
 if


the
 stock
 price
 goes
 up.
 I
 mean
 it
 is


very
 rare
 to
 find
 companies
 at
 this


scale
 that
 can
 actually
 do
 what
 Nvidia


is
 doing
 and
 can
 actually
 get
 the


multiple
 expansion
 while
 the
 growth


continues
 to
 come
 down
 or
 the
 growth


continues
 to
 go
 up
 but
 the
 multiples


continue
 to
 come
 down
 and
 as
 a
 result
 I


think
 that's
 why
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the


street
 continues
 to
 upgrade
 Nvidia
 not


to
 mention
 you
 had
 this
 update
 today


which
 is
 just
 bolstering
 the
 fact
 for


your
 argument
 on
 Nvidia
 AMD
 Oracle


Broadcom
 IN
 cipher
 etc.
 Here's
 the


headline.
 Black
 Rockck,
 Invidia,


Microsoft,
 and
 XAI
 have
 formed
 a


consortium
 to
 acquire
 Aligned
 Data


Centers,
 which
 is
 a
 company
 for
 $40


billion.
 The
 acquisition
 is
 the
 first


under
 their
 new
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


AI
 infrastructure
 partnership,
 which
 is


the
 partnership
 with
 Abu
 Dhabi's
 MGX,


which
 combines
 tech
 expertise
 and


investments
 to
 build
 data
 centers
 for


OpenAI,
 Google,
 and
 Meta.
 Larry
 Frink,


the
 head
 of
 Black
 Rockck,
 told
 the


Financial
 Times
 that
 the
 venture
 will


lease
 data
 centers
 to
 tech
 firms,


keeping
 them
 off
 balance
 sheets
 and


aiding
 valuations.
 And
 essentially,


you're
 seeing
 Black
 Rockck
 and
 Nvidia,


two
 of
 the
 most
 important
 companies
 in


the
 world,
 partner
 together
 to
 fuel
 the


expansion
 of
 data
 centers.
 I
 mean,
 if


you're
 bullish
 IN
 this
 is
 why
 you
 should


probably
 be
 continue
 to
 be
 bullish
 I
 if


you're
 bullish
 Cipher
 or
 Bit
 Farms
 or


AMD,
 I
 mean
 obviously
 all
 the
 data


center
 players
 are
 benefiting
 from
 this.


All
 the
 companies
 that
 sell
 the
 GPUs


like
 an
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 are
 benefiting


from
 this.
 But
 all
 the
 parts
 of
 the


ecosystem,
 the
 SMCIS
 of
 the
 world,
 the


Dells
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 Microns
 of
 the


world,
 SMCI
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Micron


right
 here,
 by
 the
 way,
 Micron's
 had
 a


phenomenal
 run
 up
 2%.
 Micron
 up
 60%
 over


the
 past
 five
 months.
 All
 of
 them


getting
 some
 momentum
 from
 this.
 Nebus


obviously
 big
 player
 here.
 That's
 up


2.7%.
 And
 then
 Coreweave
 as
 well,
 that's


up
 2.6%.


So
 the
 question
 then
 becomes,
 and
 I'm


getting
 this
 question
 a
 lot
 because
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 asking,
 hey,
 Microsoft


right
 here
 up
 half
 a
 percent
 on
 this


news.
 Does
 that
 mean
 I
 buy
 I
 rent?
 Does


that
 mean
 I
 buy
 Bit
 Farms
 which
 has
 gone


from
 250
 to
 like
 what's
 it
 at
 in
 the


pre-market
 624?
 Uh
 does
 that
 mean
 I
 buy


CleanSpark?
 Does
 that
 mean
 I
 buy


Marathon
 etc?


My
 answer
 is
 the
 same
 answer
 as
 as
 I
 had


yesterday.
 You
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 is


your
 risk
 tolerance
 ready
 to
 deal
 with


these
 companies
 after
 they've
 already


gone
 up
 some
 of
 them
 10x
 some
 of
 them
 5x


some
 of
 them
 3x
 in
 the
 past
 couple
 of


weeks
 not
 even
 the
 past
 couple
 of


months.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 broader
 like
 I


think
 the
 most
 objective
 way
 to
 answer


this
 is
 that
 the
 broader
 macro
 theme
 for


an
 Iran
 cipher
 bit
 farms
 etc
 is
 positive


and
 it's
 likely
 going
 to
 continue
 if
 you


just
 believe
 in
 the
 overall
 capex
 spent


I
 think
 there's
 way
 too
 much
 evidence
 to


deny
 that
 that's
 not
 happening
 the


question
 becomes
 do
 you
 take
 a
 risk
 on


one
 of
 those
 individual
 stocks
 if
 you're


not
 already
 in
 it
 if
 you're
 already
 in


it
 I
 think
 you
 sit
 back
 I
 really
 do


think
 you
 sit
 back
 I
 mean
 maybe
 you
 can


trim
 if
 you
 want
 to
 you
 know
 take
 some


profits
 or
 take
 out
 your
 initial
 but
 I
 I


think
 if
 the
 trend
 is
 higher
 and
 you


believe
 in
 the
 company
 then
 the
 tailwind


wind
 of
 the
 trend
 in
 and
 of
 itself


should
 take
 the
 company
 higher.
 Like
 if


I'm
 in
 Nebius
 at
 30
 or
 40
 or
 50
 or
 even


80
 after
 that
 Microsoft
 deal,
 I'm
 not


that
 worried
 about
 taking
 my
 profits
 at


130
 140
 because
 the
 overall
 tailwind


should
 be
 going
 higher.
 If
 you
 are
 a
 new


entrant
 to
 any
 of
 those
 companies,
 you


got
 to
 ask
 yourself
 how
 much
 do
 you


believe
 in
 the
 company?
 And
 that
 comes


down
 to
 personal
 due
 diligence.
 That


also
 comes
 down
 to
 the
 valuation


metrics.
 That
 comes
 down
 to
 hey,
 how


much
 do
 you
 think
 they
 can
 actually
 get


on
 the
 GPU
 ROIs?
 I
 mean,
 I
 ran
 seems
 to


be
 the
 best
 in
 the
 field.
 I
 have
 a
 very


small
 position
 in
 it.
 nothing
 too


massive.
 Based
 on
 a
 couple
 of
 equity


reports
 I
 read,
 I
 ran
 has
 the
 best
 price


targets
 because
 of
 their
 ability
 to


license
 GPUs
 better
 than
 some
 of
 the


other
 ones.
 Uh
 but
 it's
 also
 run
 a
 lot.


It's
 also
 run
 a
 lot.
 So
 I
 I
 really
 think


for
 those
 that
 are
 feeling
 the
 FOMO
 of


getting
 into
 those
 you
 the
 trend
 is
 on


your
 side.
 The
 question
 is
 are
 you


getting
 in
 at
 a
 great
 valuation?
 And


that
 comes
 down
 to
 like
 you
 know
 do
 you


actually
 understand
 the
 company
 enough


to
 feel
 comfortable
 buying
 dips
 or


continue
 buying
 into
 strength?
 But
 it


doesn't
 seem
 like
 that
 trend
 is
 slowing


down
 anytime
 soon.
 Yeah,
 Terolf.
 I
 mean,


all
 these
 guys
 and
 Cipher
 and
 Terwolf


getting
 investments
 by
 Google
 definitely


adds
 to
 their
 legitimacy.
 But
 these


stocks
 are
 quite
 incredible.
 I
 mean,


every
 day
 you
 wake
 up,
 Iren's
 up
 another


four
 or
 five
 percent
 because
 this
 whole


data
 center
 theme
 continues
 to
 be


stronger.
 Now,
 is
 that
 necessarily


healthy?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 if
 I


continues
 to
 execute,
 one
 can't
 say
 it's


not
 healthy.
 Uh
 because,
 you
 know,
 the


execution
 will
 continue
 to
 justify
 the


multiple.
 But
 if
 there's
 any
 hiccups,


these
 stocks
 are
 not
 priced
 for
 those


hiccups.
 These
 stocks
 are
 priced
 for


phenomenal
 execution.
 And
 you
 have
 to


ask
 yourself,
 how
 much
 do
 you
 believe
 in


the
 ability
 for
 management
 to
 execute?
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 what
 basically
 Mike
 Norat


said.
 He
 said, "Hey,
 you
 really
 got
 to


look
 into
 do
 you
 believe
 management
 that


is
 transitioning
 a
 company
 that
 was
 not


making
 any
 money
 doing
 Bitcoin
 mining


into
 a
 data
 center
 play.
 Are
 they
 worth


uh
 taking
 a
 bet
 on?"
 And
 I
 think
 that's


kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things


to
 play
 out
 right
 here.
 Sound
 in
 the


pre-markets,
 that's
 moving
 up.
 Look
 at


that.
 Wow.
 5%
 on
 Sound.
 That
 is
 getting


some
 love.
 I
 don't
 know if
 there's
 a


headline
 right
 there.
 They
 did
 have
 a


good
 earnings
 two
 weeks
 ago
 and
 that
 one


has
 done
 a
 pretty
 strong
 move.
 I
 think


the
 stock
 was
 at
 like
 14
 before


earnings.
 So
 22,
 not
 too
 bad
 right
 here.


And
 then
 BMR
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 This


one's
 been
 flat
 all
 week.
 Kind
 of
 up
 and


then
 flat.
 Obviously,
 Ethereum
 fell
 all


the
 way
 to
 3,400
 and
 then
 recovered
 to


4200,
 back
 down
 to
 4,000.
 So
 Bitmine


right
 here
 staying
 just
 below
 55.
 Um,


hard
 for
 this
 to
 break
 above
 60
 unless


Ethereum
 is
 back
 at
 that
 44,500
 range,


but
 at least
 it's
 not
 at
 uh
 at
 47.
 So


this
 is
 what
 you
 got
 in
 the
 context
 of


what's
 going
 on
 with
 AI
 and
 data


centers.
 Let's
 transition
 to
 Mr.
 Brad


Gersonner.
 He
 was
 on
 CNBC
 today
 and
 here


are
 his
 thoughts
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with


the
 concept
 of
 a
 bubble,
 if
 we're
 in
 a


bubble,
 and
 where
 this
 AI
 ecosystem
 is


going,


some
 kind
 of
 bubble.
 And
 he
 put
 us
 on
 a


comparable
 basis,
 he
 thought
 of
 October


of
 1999,
 which
 was
 an
 interesting
 moment


because
 the
 market
 still
 had
 40%
 to
 go,


right?
 That's
 right.
 Um,
 well,
 first,


you
 rarely
 have
 a
 bubble
 when
 the


hottest
 book
 in
 New
 York
 is
 about
 a


stock
 market
 crash
 and
 everybody
 who


comes
 on
 the
 show
 talks
 about
 a
 bubble.


There's
 a
 bubble
 in
 bubbles.


Howard
 Mark
 said,
 you
 know,
 it's
 too


early
 because
 everybody's
 talking
 about


a
 bubble.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 if
 you
 look
 at


multiples
 as
 an
 example,
 you
 called
 out


Bernstein
 yesterday,
 I
 thought
 was


great.
 He
 was
 talking
 about
 50
 times


trailing
 PE
 for
 Nvidia.
 It's
 a
 it's
 25


to
 30
 times
 on
 a
 forward
 PE.
 That's
 not


the
 stuff
 that
 bubbles
 are
 generally


made
 of.
 But
 certainly
 the
 further
 and


further
 you
 go
 out
 on
 the
 risk
 curve,


Andrew,
 you
 will
 find
 things
 that
 make


you
 scratch
 your
 head.
 You
 say,
 "I


wouldn't
 have
 done
 that
 deal."
 And


they're
 going
 to
 be
 meme
 stocks
 that


certainly,
 you
 know,
 have
 no
 revenue,


Becky,
 and
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 quantum


space
 or
 whatever
 where
 you
 say
 that


valuation
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense.
 But
 we


have
 this
 all
 the
 time.
 The
 bigger


question
 is
 this
 is
 the
 phase
 shift


associated
 with
 AI
 is
 the
 transformation


of
 all
 computing
 with
 now
 computer


assisted
 intelligence
 is
 it
 as
 as
 big
 as


the
 internet
 and
 I
 would
 argue
 that
 it's


as
 big
 as
 the
 internet
 and
 if
 you
 spend


all
 your
 time
 hand
 ringing
 like
 many


people
 did
 in
 2001
 and
 2002
 about
 the


internet
 saying
 I
 told
 you
 so
 they
 miss


the
 next
 20
 years
 of
 compounding
 in


Amazon
 in
 Google
 and
 all
 these
 big


way
 I
 would


agree
 with
 you
 in
 I
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to


change
 the
 world.
 It's
 a
 generational


shift
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 The
 question
 is,


could
 there
 be
 a
 hiccup
 along
 the
 way?


And
 what
 does
 that
 hiccup
 look
 like
 in


terms
 of
 right
 now
 when
 you
 say
 to


yourself
 the
 upside
 in
 this
 marketplace


today
 versus
 the
 downside?
 We
 had
 an


analyst
 on
 earlier
 this
 morning
 who


said,
 you
 know what,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 to
 reach


materially
 higher
 numbers
 right
 now.
 But


she
 kind
 of
 thought,
 you
 know,
 could
 the


market
 be
 off
 five
 or
 10%.
 She
 said
 that


didn't
 seem
 totally
 unreasonable
 to
 her.


We've
 had
 two
 25%
 draw
 downs
 in
 Nvidia


this
 year,


right?


Remember
 the
 deepseek
 moment?
 Stock
 went


stock
 was
 down
 25%.
 And
 then
 on
 the


tariff
 moment,
 the
 stock
 got
 down
 to
 92


bucks
 a
 share.
 It's
 at
 180
 today.
 So


volatility
 is
 the
 name
 of
 the
 game
 for


two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,
 we
 have
 a


president
 that's
 trying
 to
 reset


global
 trade
 policy,
 national
 industrial


policy
 in
 the
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 super


cycle.
 So
 that's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


uncertainty.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 healthy


in
 a
 market,
 right?
 It's
 not
 straight
 up


and
 to
 the
 right.
 We've
 had
 a
 lot
 of


draw
 downs
 this
 year.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at


these
 stocks
 and
 you
 say
 to
 me,
 does
 it


make
 sense
 that
 Nvidia
 is
 up
 35%
 given


that
 their
 topline
 has
 grown
 way
 faster


than
 50%.
 The
 answer
 is
 yes.
 It's


cheaper
 today
 than
 when
 the
 stock
 was


$200
 a
 share.
 But
 but
 here
 here's
 the


the
 real
 trick
 and
 and
 that
 is


we
 can
 tell
 the
 difference
 between
 some


crazy
 meme
 stock
 or
 a
 you
 know
 a
 new


crypto
 junkcoin
 that
 we've
 never
 heard


of


and
 Nvidia,
 right?


But
 how
 do
 you
 as
 an
 investor


find
 those
 gradiations
 in
 the
 middle?


What
 how
 do
 you
 determine
 what's
 real,


what's
 not
 when
 it's
 not
 so
 extreme?


I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 question,
 Becky.
 If


you
 look
 at
 how
 uh
 on
 the
 venture


capital
 side
 of
 things,
 you
 see
 this


barbell
 approach
 and
 we're
 following
 it


as
 well,
 right?
 We're
 we're
 really
 large


investors
 in
 open
 AI,
 clear
 breakout


market
 winners.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 we're


investing
 in,
 you
 know,
 very
 small


companies
 where
 we're
 buying
 10
 to
 20%


of
 the
 company.
 In
 the
 middle
 are
 these


inflection
 growth
 assets,
 really
 high


valuations,
 but
 haven't
 yet
 proven
 that


they're
 the
 multi-year
 compounder.
 There


are
 over
 a
 thousand
 of
 those
 in
 Silicon


Valley,
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars
 that
 are


trying
 to
 raise
 capital
 right
 now.


That's
 where
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see


a
 lot
 of
 the
 chop,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 washing


out.
 You'll
 also
 see
 that
 in
 the
 public


markets,
 right?
 This
 is
 a
 moment
 of
 uh


uh
 you
 know,
 peak
 uh
 creative


destruction,
 right?
 There
 are
 winners


and
 there
 are
 losers.
 And
 that's
 why
 we


see
 the
 volatility.
 How
 can
 Oracle,
 Joe,


be
 up
 25%
 on
 earnings?
 It's
 a,
 you
 know,


it's
 a
 headscratcher
 when
 they
 announce


these
 deals
 because
 they're
 gaining


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 market
 cap
 in
 a


single
 morning.
 You
 only
 have
 that
 when


you
 have
 this
 level
 of
 uncertainty
 about


the
 path
 forward.
 So
 look,
 I
 think


Gersonner
 is
 making
 some
 really


important
 points
 and
 it's
 quite
 similar


to
 I
 think
 what
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 which
 is
 the


question
 of
 a
 bubble
 gets
 asked
 and
 his


argument
 is
 essentially,


hey,
 if
 these
 stocks
 that
 are
 uh


memeish,
 I
 mean,
 he
 literally
 says
 these


these
 companies
 that
 have
 overinflated


valuations,
 no
 revenues,
 multi-billion


dollar
 market
 caps,
 if
 they
 go
 to
 zero,


it
 doesn't
 affect
 the
 market.
 If
 they
 go


to
 zero,
 it
 doesn't
 affect
 the
 market.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 basically
 been
 the


stance
 of
 all
 of
 us
 that
 believe
 in
 this


bull
 market
 and
 have
 been
 trying
 to


fight
 off
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 toppy
 nature


of
 like
 seeing
 a
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 run
 up


20%
 in
 a
 day,
 which
 is
 hey,
 if
 all
 the


stocks
 in
 that
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 end
 up


going
 to
 zero,
 it
 does
 not
 affect
 the


transformational
 shift
 we're
 seeing
 of


AI,
 which
 is
 a
 whole
 different
 sort
 of


philosophical
 argument
 on
 how
 you
 think


of
 technology.
 And
 B,
 it
 doesn't
 stop


the
 earnings
 growth
 that
 we're
 seeing


from
 the
 actual
 legitimate
 companies,


the
 Morgan
 Stanley's,
 the
 Goldman
 Sachs


of
 the
 world,
 the
 Netflixes,
 the
 Nvidas,


the
 AMDs,
 etc.
 that
 are
 producing
 the


earnings
 that
 justify
 why
 the
 S&P
 trades


at
 these
 levels.
 And
 so
 the
 question


then
 becomes,
 you
 know,
 for
 for
 most


people,
 which
 is,
 hey,
 all
 right,
 do
 I


do
 I
 hop
 on
 the
 trend
 of
 Olo,
 which
 is


hitting
 a
 new
 all-time
 high
 in
 the


pre-markets?
 And
 every
 day
 you
 see
 this


thing
 hit
 a
 new
 all-time
 high.


Obviously,
 psychologically,
 it's
 hard
 to


navigate
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 just


listen
 to
 what
 Brad
 Gersonner
 said,


which
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 companies
 in
 the


middle
 are
 going
 to
 get
 wiped
 out,


private
 or
 public.
 Is
 Aqua
 one
 of
 them?


I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Are
 the
 quantum
 stocks


one
 of them?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 But
 the


point
 is
 trying
 to
 short
 them
 maybe
 is


not
 the
 easiest.
 Trying
 to
 go
 long
 is


also
 not
 the
 easiest.
 It
 really
 is
 one


of
 those
 questions
 of
 how
 much
 risk
 do


you
 want
 to
 take
 versus
 buying
 companies


in
 the
 fundamental
 shift
 of
 our
 society


aka
 the
 Nvidas
 of
 the
 world
 that
 yes
 are


not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 the
 upside
 of
 an


Ollo
 probably
 but
 are
 going
 to
 allow
 you


to
 sleep
 at
 night
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is


the
 the
 most
 important
 question.
 Now


again,
 we
 we
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


yesterday
 talking
 about
 FOMO
 and
 the


reason
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 is
 because
 it


is
 really
 hard
 when
 you
 wake
 up
 and
 you


see
 Olo's
 up
 another
 10
 bucks
 in
 the


pre-market
 and
 you
 know
 you
 see
 this


thing
 that
 was
 at
 six
 then
 20
 then
 30


then
 40
 then
 50
 then
 60
 at
 100
 you're


like
 there's
 no
 way
 it
 can
 go
 higher
 at


120
 you're
 like
 it's
 a
 bubble
 at
 150


you're
 like
 there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell
 it


goes
 higher
 now
 it's
 184
 at
 200
 it's


going
 to
 feel
 worse
 but
 do
 you
 take
 the


risk
 of
 getting
 into
 it
 I'm
 not
 you
 know


for
 everyone
 who's
 asking
 me
 like
 I'm


just
 not
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 that
 risk


And
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 take
 that


risk.
 And
 I
 think
 Brad
 Gersonner,
 by
 the


way,
 who
 manages
 $5
 billion,
 he's
 not


taking
 that
 risk
 either.
 He's
 betting
 on


the
 companies
 that
 he
 knows
 are
 going
 to


outperform
 long
 term
 and
 that
 have
 solid


moes
 that
 they
 can
 be
 um
 relied
 upon.


And
 that's
 the
 important
 thing.
 Someone


says
 everything
 is
 running.
 It's
 super


concerning.
 I
 will
 not
 disagree.
 It
 does


feel
 super
 concerning
 that
 lots
 and
 lots


of
 things
 are
 running.
 I
 mean
 to
 add
 to


the
 concerning
 part
 of
 this
 which
 you


know
 might
 bake
 into
 a
 thesis
 for
 people


that
 want
 to
 go
 short
 some
 of these


names
 or
 at least
 buy
 puts
 on
 some
 of


these
 names
 as
 a
 hedge
 which
 I
 don't


hate.
 It's
 just
 you
 have
 to
 be
 ready


with
 that
 short
 or
 those
 puts
 going
 to


zero
 because
 you
 know
 the
 cliche
 is
 that


the
 market
 can
 stay
 rational
 longer
 than


you
 can
 stay
 solvent.
 Uh
 5x
 single
 stock


ETFs
 are
 coming
 folks.
 5x
 single
 stock


ETFs
 are
 coming.
 This
 is
 by
 Volatility


Shares.
 Uh
 effective
 on
 December
 29th,


2025.
 You
 will
 be
 able
 to
 go
 5x
 long.


AMD,
 Amazon,
 Coinbase,
 Circle,
 Google,


Microgy,
 Nvidia,
 Palanteer,
 Tesla,


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 Salana,
 XRP,
 and
 you


will
 also
 be
 able
 to
 go
 3x
 long.
 All
 of


those
 names
 as
 well.
 That
 means
 if


Palanteer
 falls
 10%
 in
 a
 day,
 your
 5x


Palanteer
 ETF
 will
 fall
 50%.


In
 a
 day,
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 perpetual


futures
 contracts
 that
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 in
 the
 crypto
 world.


Obviously,
 you
 can
 go
 like
 from
 10x
 to


150x
 on
 those.


Well,
 this
 company,
 Volatility
 Shares,


is
 coming
 up
 with
 the
 way
 to
 go
 5x,


which
 is
 still
 pretty
 aggressive
 in
 the


form
 of
 a
 freaking
 ETF,
 which
 makes
 it


so
 easy
 because
 all
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is,


you
 know,
 press
 one
 button
 and
 then


boom,
 you
 have
 5x
 leverage.
 I
 mean,
 does


this
 feel
 kind
 of
 toppy?
 Yeah,
 you
 don't


see
 these
 products
 in
 a
 bare
 market.
 You


don't
 see
 these
 types
 of
 products
 where,


and
 imagine
 they,
 you
 know,
 accumulate


significant
 AUM.
 You're
 talking
 about


potentially
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 or


billions
 of
 dollars
 that
 are
 leveraging


up
 on
 pretty
 important
 companies,
 I


would
 say,
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 Three
 to


5x
 long.
 How
 long
 until
 we
 get
 a
 10x


ETF?
 Well,
 if
 these
 succeed,
 we'll


probably
 get
 the
 10x
 ETF,
 too.
 So
 the


point
 is,
 look,
 when
 you
 see
 this
 type


of
 stuff,
 when
 you
 see
 the
 quantum
 thing


going
 crazy,
 when
 you
 see
 the
 nuclear


stocks
 that
 have
 no
 revenue
 getting
 $30


billion
 valuations,
 you
 have
 to
 ask


yourself,
 is
 this
 a
 market
 top
 or
 is


this
 an
 individual
 part
 of
 the
 market


that
 is
 going
 to
 get
 flushed
 out
 and
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 lose
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 but
 that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 affect


the
 broader
 theme
 of
 this
 bull
 market.


And
 I
 think
 based
 on
 what
 Brad
 Gersonner


said,
 I
 would
 agree
 it's
 likely
 not


affecting
 the
 broader
 theme
 of
 this


market
 because
 that
 theme
 is
 so
 strong


in
 regards
 to
 AI
 and
 capex.
 By
 the
 way,


speaking
 of
 Oaklo
 and
 some
 of these


nuclear
 stocks,
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 that
 it's
 actually
 running
 in


the
 pre-market
 right
 here
 is
 because
 of


this.
 The
 Army
 today
 has
 announced
 a


program
 called
 Janice
 for
 next


generation
 nuclear
 energy.
 The


Department
 of
 the
 Army
 today
 announced


the
 launch
 of
 the
 Janis
 program,
 a
 next


generation
 nuclear
 power
 program
 that


will
 deliver
 resilient,
 secure,
 and


assured
 energy
 to
 support
 national


defense
 installations
 and
 critical


missions.
 We
 don't
 know
 if
 Oaklo
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 winner
 in
 this
 new
 Janis


program
 or
 if
 SMR
 or
 if
 nanuclear
 energy


but
 the
 point
 is
 the
 theme
 of
 nuclear
 is


hot.
 It
 matters
 in
 AI.
 You
 got
 the
 the


department
 of
 the
 army
 coming
 out
 saying


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 very
 supportive


of
 nuclear
 energy.
 You
 have
 ties
 between


Oaklo
 and
 the
 DOE
 and
 and
 the
 the


secretary
 of
 energy.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of


that,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 stock
 that


will
 have
 tons
 of
 momentum
 on
 the


narrative
 alone
 go
 up.
 And
 your
 job
 as


an
 investor
 is
 to
 decide
 do
 you
 want
 to


trade
 on
 those
 narratives
 or
 do
 you
 want


to
 take
 a
 risk
 on
 those
 narratives
 and
 I


think
 Gersonner's
 argument
 is
 like
 you


don't
 need
 to
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 you
 can
 find
 other
 names
 that
 are


doing
 very
 well
 in
 the
 broader
 trend


that
 doesn't
 have
 to
 allow
 the
 entire


bull
 market
 to
 end.
 Here
 is
 his
 argument


on
 some
 of
 the
 winners
 that
 will
 be


taking
 place
 in
 this
 AI
 market.


Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 certainty
 that
 you


think
 you
 have
 about
 the
 path
 forward.


Yeah.


So
 you
 would
 say
 who
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the


ultimate
 winners
 in
 all
 this


right
 now?
 Yeah.


Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


Nvidia
 you
 think
 is
 obviously
 a
 winner.


Would
 you
 would
 you
 touch
 an
 AMD?
 Would


you
 touch
 a
 Broadcom?


Sure.
 We've
 owned
 We've
 We
 own
 Broadcom.


We've
 owned
 AMD.
 What
 I
 would
 say
 is
 if


you
 go
 back
 to
 2022,
 and
 I
 showed
 this


graphic
 on
 the
 podcast
 recently,
 in


2022,
 right,
 only
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years


ago,
 Andrew,
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 had
 the
 same


revenue.


Yeah.


This
 year,
 AMD
 will
 do
 just
 over
 30


billion
 and
 Nvidia
 will
 do
 225
 billion.


100%
 of
 the
 incremental
 market
 share
 to


AI
 basically
 has
 gone
 to
 NVIDIA,


right?


AMD
 missed
 the
 wave,
 but
 to
 Lisa's


credit,
 she
 raised
 her
 hand
 and
 said,


"I'm
 betting
 the
 farm.
 I'm
 going
 to
 give


10%
 of
 my
 company
 to
 OpenAI
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 bet
 that
 the
 MI450
 is
 going
 to


work
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 competitive


with
 Nvidia."
 That's
 not
 exactly
 the


position
 of
 strength
 that
 you
 want
 to
 be


coming
 at
 it,
 but
 it's
 also
 a


recognition.
 Lisa
 said,
 "We're
 in
 year


two
 of
 a
 10-year
 super
 cycle
 to
 build


out
 the
 compute
 in
 America.
 If
 you're


not
 on
 the
 AI
 wave,
 then
 you're
 not


going
 to
 participate
 in
 all
 that


upside."


When
 you
 think
 about
 the
 big
 LLMs,


OpenAI,
 at least
 clearly
 seems
 like
 they


are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 winner.
 Google,
 I


don't
 know
 where
 you
 think
 Anthropic


lands
 in
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 know
 you
 own


Meta.


Yep.


They're
 trying
 to
 play
 this
 game,
 but


playing
 in
 an
 open
 source
 way.
 Does
 that


work?


Yeah.
 So
 uh
 let's
 let's
 bucket
 it
 into


consumer
 and
 enterprise.
 I
 think
 that's


the
 easiest
 way.
 On
 the
 consumer
 side,


I've
 invested
 in
 three
 or
 four
 super


cycles
 now.
 The
 internet
 super
 cycle,


the
 social,
 mobile,
 etc.
 The
 winner


tends
 to
 be
 winner
 take
 most,
 right?
 So


Google
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 competitors,
 20


competitors
 in
 search,
 they
 all
 have


pretty
 good
 technologies,
 but
 Google


consumed
 98%
 of
 all
 the
 upside
 ever


associated
 with
 search.
 Meta
 in
 the
 uh


in
 in
 the
 case
 of
 social,
 Apple


obviously
 with
 the
 app
 store.
 I
 think


chat
 GPT
 at
 one
 uh
 you
 know
 well
 over
 a


billion
 and
 a
 half
 monthly
 users
 over


800
 million
 weekly
 users
 and
 what
 most


people
 don't
 talk
 about
 is
 the


engagement
 engagement
 is
 going
 up.
 So
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 cohorts
 under
 those


numbers
 they're
 extraordinary
 and
 so
 I


think
 they're
 they're
 breakaway
 now
 in


consumer.
 Can
 Google
 catch
 them?
 I
 think


it's
 very
 challenging.
 Can
 Meta
 catch


them?
 I
 think
 challenging.
 Will
 they


build
 good
 businesses
 around
 AI?
 Yes.


Right.
 These
 are
 money
 machines.
 the


best
 his
 the
 best
 businesses
 in
 the


history
 of
 capitalism.
 They're
 going


nowhere.
 I'm
 impressed
 by
 what
 Sundar
 is


doing.
 I'm
 also
 impressed
 by
 what


Alexander
 Wang
 and
 the
 team
 at
 Meta
 are


doing
 in
 but
 they
 know
 how
 hard
 it's


going
 to
 be
 to
 catch
 up
 in
 consumer
 on


the
 so
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 praise
 by


Gersonner
 for
 those
 max
 7
 stocks
 that


are
 likely
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 Google


obviously
 have
 that
 phenomenal
 run
 from


150
 basically
 up
 to
 250
 and
 it
 is


holding
 these
 200
 levels.
 The
 next
 one


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 wondering
 about


is
 Amazon.
 Will
 it
 actually
 be
 able
 to


make
 the
 run
 that
 some
 people
 think
 it


can
 make?
 And
 look,
 I've
 started
 adding


a
 lot
 more
 Amazon.
 Uh
 I
 I
 really
 do


think
 that
 this
 is
 a
 safer
 play
 to
 be


in.
 It's
 Amazon
 at
 the
 end.
 There's
 not


a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 where
 you
 can
 say
 if
 it


falls
 20%,
 who
 cares?
 It's
 Amazon.
 You


can
 say
 that
 about
 Amazon.
 Like
 if


CleanSpark
 falls
 20%.
 You
 can't
 be
 like,


who
 cares?
 It's
 CleanSpark.
 It's
 like
 no


Amazon
 falls.
 Amazon
 falls
 30%.
 Who


cares?
 It's
 Amazon.
 Like
 we
 know
 Amazon


over
 the
 next
 decade
 is
 not
 going


anywhere.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 company


doesn't
 have
 to
 execute.
 That
 does
 mean


that
 you
 can
 actually
 know
 whatever


price
 you're
 getting
 it.
 If
 you
 truly
 do


have
 a
 10-year
 trajectory,
 not
 like
 a


10-month
 trajectory,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


okay
 holding
 on
 to
 Amazon.
 It
 can
 become


a
 cornerstone
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people's


portfolios.
 Uh
 I
 want
 to
 give
 some


credit
 right
 here
 to
 some
 DD
 I
 found
 on


Amazon
 by
 Austin.
 It's
 a
 great
 Twitter


account.
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 this
 in
 the


chat.
 Definitely
 would
 recommend
 taking


a
 follow
 right
 here.
 He
 was
 screaming


about
 Google
 at
 150
 and
 uh
 obviously
 he


was
 vindicated
 on
 that.
 Amazon
 is
 now


his
 second
 largest
 holding,
 about
 11.5%


of
 his
 portfolio.
 And
 just
 running


through
 his
 points
 real
 quick,
 his


argument
 is,
 hey,
 Jeff
 is
 not
 checked


out.
 Jeff
 spends
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking


about
 AI.
 He
 even
 said
 in
 interviews


that
 he
 goes
 to
 the
 company
 on
 a
 monthly


basis
 and
 discusses
 their
 AI
 strategy.


So
 although
 Jasse
 is
 the
 leader
 of
 AWS


and
 the
 head
 of
 the
 company,
 uh
 Jeff
 is


still
 chairman
 of
 the
 board,
 he
 still


owns
 9%
 of
 the
 company.
 Second
 point,


which
 is
 another
 really
 important
 point,


Tranium
 2
 chips
 are
 now
 ramping
 along


with
 step
 change
 improvements
 in


Nvidia's
 product
 line,
 leading
 to


increased
 token
 production,
 which
 means


at
 its
 core,
 it's
 not
 like
 Tranium
 is


necessarily
 going
 to
 undercut
 Nvidia,


but
 Google's
 TPUs,
 Amazon's
 Tranium,


there
 is
 an
 ability
 for
 Amazon
 to
 gain
 a


lot
 more
 operating
 leverage
 by


developing
 their
 own
 chips.
 And
 that's


something
 that
 probably
 can't
 be
 denied.


Uh,
 here
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 stat


that
 I
 saw.
 The
 12
 months
 ended
 AWS


revenues
 was
 98.5
 billion,
 and
 for
 2025,


that
 number
 is
 116
 billion.
 The
 17.5


billion
 growth
 year-over-year
 on
 a
 TTM


basis
 for
 AWS
 is
 onethird
 of
 Google's


run
 rate
 at
 50
 billion.
 I
 mean,
 that's


incredible,
 dude.
 So,
 I
 know
 we
 we
 we


harp
 on
 AWS
 for
 not
 growing
 as
 much
 as


GCP
 and
 and and
 uh
 and
 Azure,
 but


obviously
 Amazon
 has
 been
 in
 this
 since


2006.
 They
 just
 have
 a
 higher
 base.
 And


so,
 them
 being
 punished
 because
 they're


not
 growing
 as
 fast,
 but
 they're
 doing


substantially
 more
 amounts
 of
 volume
 is


not
 a
 reason
 they
 should
 be
 punished.


That's
 why
 every
 analyst
 on
 the
 SE


street
 whether
 it's
 Oppenheenimer,
 JP


Morgan,
 Benchmark,
 Bernstein,
 Goldman


Sachs,
 they
 all
 have
 $280
 to
 $300


targets
 and
 they
 have
 those
 targets


because
 they
 understand
 that
 this
 is
 not


slowing
 down.
 He
 then
 says
 at
 a
 36%


segment
 margin
 that
 could
 expand
 for
 AWS


and
 with
 years
 of
 demand
 ahead,
 AWS's


contribution
 to
 operating
 income
 could


still
 be
 underestimated.
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 Amazon
 fell
 last
 quarter
 is


because
 their
 operating
 leverage
 went


from
 12.5
 to
 12.4.
 I
 know
 it's
 0.1
 like


what
 difference
 does
 it
 make?
 For
 a


company
 that
 doesn't
 really
 have
 the


best
 margins
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is,
 you


know,
 selling
 stuff
 from
 China,
 you
 need


to
 get
 those
 margins
 to
 go
 higher
 and


AWS
 is
 making
 up
 the
 bulk
 of
 those


margins.
 If
 that
 margin
 can
 expand
 due


to
 efficiencies
 via
 AI,
 which
 you
 would


imagine
 every
 company
 is
 working
 on,


then
 operating
 leverage
 should
 increase.


If
 that
 is
 the
 case,
 net
 income
 should


increase.
 If
 that
 is
 the
 case,
 you're


probably
 getting
 a
 better
 price
 to


earnings,
 which
 means
 the
 multiple


ultimately
 expands.
 And
 then
 the
 final


thing
 right
 here,
 he
 says
 that


advertising,
 which
 we
 don't
 talk
 about


that
 much
 on
 Amazon,
 61
 billion
 annually


recurring
 revenue
 is
 growing
 20%.
 It's
 a


very
 high
 margin
 segment
 of
 their


business.
 They're
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 market


share
 away
 from
 the
 other
 smaller


companies
 in
 adtech
 because
 Amazon
 has


all
 their
 data
 already.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


the
 subscription
 revenue
 being
 47


billion
 annually
 recurring
 advertising


being
 at
 61.
 Any
 ramp
 up
 in
 AWS,
 I
 think


really
 is
 going
 to
 be
 where
 this
 stock


gets
 exciting.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it


happens
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 don't


know if
 the
 stock
 is
 250
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 If
 it's
 stuck
 at
 210,
 stuck
 at


215,
 barely
 above
 220.
 I
 just
 know
 if


I'm
 buying
 a
 stock
 like
 an
 Amazon,
 I
 am


not
 afraid
 of
 owning
 it
 at
 whatever


price
 because
 you're
 likely
 going
 to


have
 a
 five-year
 trajectory
 where
 Amazon


does
 much
 better.
 There's
 Austin


Twitter,
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to


follow
 Mike.
 He
 does
 really
 really
 good


due
 diligence
 on
 a
 lot
 of these
 max


seven
 names.
 Now,
 one
 last
 thing
 about


Amazon
 right
 here,
 right
 here,
 there
 was


a
 chart
 yesterday
 showing
 that
 Amazon


has
 outperformed
 the
 NASDAQ,
 which


sucks,
 right?
 Because
 the
 NASDAQ
 over


the
 past
 five
 years
 is
 up
 107%.
 Amazon


is
 only
 up
 32%.
 So
 it
 it
 makes
 you,
 you


know,
 wonder
 what
 the
 heck
 is
 going
 on.


Why
 is
 Amazon
 uh
 not
 able,
 you
 know,
 to


outperform
 an
 index?
 Usually
 individual


MAX
 7
 should
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 if


you
 go
 out
 10
 years
 and
 take
 a
 look
 at


what's
 going
 on,
 the
 NASDAQ's
 up
 450%,


Amazon's
 up
 700%.


So
 with
 Amazon,
 it's
 one
 of
 those


companies
 where
 the
 multiple
 has
 always


been
 expensive.
 the
 multiples
 now
 really


start
 to
 to
 become
 cheap
 because
 the


stock
 has
 not
 really
 performed.
 Um,
 and


if
 you
 go
 out
 a
 few
 years
 back,
 you'll


see
 that
 if
 you
 you
 put
 in
 those
 extra


couple
 years
 of
 growth
 in
 terms
 of
 the


stock
 price,
 it
 vastly
 beats
 the
 NASDAQ.


And
 so
 I
 think
 the
 opportunity
 is
 in
 the


underperformance
 of
 Amazon
 relative
 to


old
 Mac
 7
 and
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 swan


aspect
 of
 the
 stock,
 the
 sleep
 well
 at


night
 aspect
 allows
 you
 to
 know
 that


growth
 is
 not
 stopping.
 And
 as
 Andy
 says


right
 here,
 sentiment
 can
 change


overnight
 with
 Amazon.
 So
 look,
 you
 can


either
 get
 into
 a
 core,
 which
 by
 the


way,
 we
 just
 got
 an
 update
 from
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 right
 here.
 Coreweave
 is


going
 to
 be
 partnering
 with
 AI
 chip


cluster
 company
 Poolside.
 Uh
 AI
 Poolside


is
 an
 AI
 startup
 and
 Cororee
 is
 going
 to


be
 planning
 a
 massive
 West
 Texas
 data


center
 with
 them.
 Just
 incredible,


incredible
 growth
 in
 the
 data
 center


space.
 Cory,
 right,
 they're
 up
 5%.
 You


can
 either
 buy
 coreweave
 or
 you
 can
 buy


Amazon.
 There
 is
 not
 a
 right
 or
 wrong


answer.
 Amazon
 will
 probably
 help
 you


sleep
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 at
 night
 and


it's
 not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 the
 ROI
 that


a
 core
 can
 give
 you.
 Coreeave
 is


probably
 going
 to
 vastly
 outperform
 in


my
 opinion
 just
 based
 on
 the
 narrative,


momentum,
 general
 growth,
 etc.
 of
 an


Amazon
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 years
 if


everything
 goes
 according
 to
 plan,
 but


you're
 also
 not
 getting
 it
 at
 the
 most


perfect
 valuation.
 You
 might
 be
 getting


it
 at
 a
 nosebleleed
 valuation
 quite


frankly
 and
 you
 might
 end
 up
 holding
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 bag
 long
 term.
 I
 think


you'll
 be
 okay
 with
 corweed.
 ultimately


comes
 down
 to
 at
 this
 stage
 of
 the


market,
 10
 months
 into
 the
 year
 where


most
 of
 our
 year-to-
 dates
 are
 well


above
 what
 the
 S&P
 has
 done,
 how
 much


risk
 do
 you
 want
 to
 take?
 And
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 bad
 to
 buy
 Cororeweave.
 I


just
 think
 it's
 more
 risky
 than
 an


Amazon.
 And
 so,
 it
 all
 comes
 down
 to
 the


subjective
 valuation
 of
 how
 much
 risk


you
 want
 to
 take.
 But
 the
 data
 center


news
 is
 not
 slowing
 down,
 which
 is
 why


those
 narratives
 are
 very,
 very


important.
 And
 given
 Amazon's
 almost
 a


$3
 trillion
 company,
 the
 data
 center


news
 isn't
 that
 much
 of
 a
 tailwind
 for


them
 because,
 you
 know,
 Core
 Weave
 is
 a


$50
 billion
 company.
 it's
 easier
 for


that
 stock
 to
 move.
 But
 another
 data


center
 uh
 news
 for
 Core
 Weave
 and
 that's


why
 that
 stock
 is
 up.
 Okay,
 Apple.
 We


got
 a
 bunch
 of
 headlines
 right
 here
 for


Apple.
 Apparently,
 they
 have
 announced


um
 a
 ton
 of
 new
 products.
 A
 ton
 of
 new


products.
 By
 the
 way,
 Matt
 Money
 in
 the


chat
 saying
 that
 Amazon
 will
 be
 a
 $10


trillion
 company
 one
 day.
 I
 think
 Steve


agrees
 with
 them.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 likely


going
 to
 Steve
 Well,
 Steve
 has
 done
 the


math
 and
 he
 thinks
 I
 think
 Matt
 has
 also


said
 this
 that
 Amazon
 will
 be
 the
 first


company
 to
 do
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 in


revenue.
 I
 think
 you're
 looking
 at
 like


2030ish
 when
 they
 do
 a
 2029.
 I
 think


right
 now
 they
 do
 like
 650.
 So,
 I
 mean,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 quite
 incredible.
 And
 a


company
 doing
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 in


revenue
 likely
 is
 not
 is
 not
 going
 away


anytime
 soon.
 Okay.
 So,
 what
 did
 Apple


introduce?
 M5
 chip.
 Uh,
 new
 iPad
 Pro


$999.


New
 14inch
 MacBook
 Pro
 M5
 starts
 at


$1,600.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 for
 Apple.
 The


stock
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 right
 here.
 Um,


new
 M5
 chip
 for
 the
 iPad
 Pro,
 new
 M5


chip
 for
 the
 MacBook
 Pro.
 Also,
 they


have
 enhanced
 the
 capabilities
 of
 the


Vision
 Pro


with
 an
 M5
 chip
 and
 a
 more
 comfortable


dual
 knit
 band.


Dude,
 I
 wish
 I
 freaking
 wish
 Apple
 would


give
 us
 the
 numbers
 on
 how
 much
 how
 many


Vision
 Pros
 they
 sell.
 I
 don't
 even
 know


if
 it's
 worth
 updating
 the
 Vision
 Pro


with
 a
 more
 comfortable
 band.
 Every
 time


you
 go
 to
 an
 Apple
 store,
 no
 one
 is


trying
 out
 the
 Vision
 Pro.
 like
 no
 one.


It's
 been
 two
 years,
 dude.
 That
 came
 out


in
 June
 of
 2023.
 That
 product
 came
 out
 a


while
 ago,
 and
 I
 don't
 really
 see
 anyone


using
 it,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


still
 actually
 updating
 it
 is
 quite


incredible.
 But,
 uh,
 that's
 what
 we
 got


in
 the
 context
 of
 Apple.
 That
 stock


right
 there
 at
 250
 in
 the
 pre-markets,


and
 that
 is
 green.
 Big
 Bear
 AI,
 that
 had


a
 big
 move
 yesterday,
 922,
 that's
 up


another
 3.4%.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 are
 we
 above


70?
 We
 are
 back
 above
 70.
 That's
 up


4.2%.
 ASTS
 was
 almost
 at
 100.
 AS14.


looks
 like
 it
 wants
 to
 break
 through
 on


that
 $100
 level.
 Uh
 so
 you
 got
 AS,
 Rock


Lab,
 and
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 all
 going
 green.


Na'vi,
 are
 we
 still
 above
 14?
 We
 are
 at


1308.
 This
 one
 had
 a
 monster
 35%
 move


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days.


That
 one
 continues


uh
 to
 go
 green.
 TSM,
 how's
 that
 doing?


They
 have
 earnings
 tomorrow,
 which
 is


actually
 at
 like
 3
 a.m.
 tonight.
 So
 if


anyone's
 awake,
 you'll
 see
 the
 results


posted,
 at least
 if
 you're
 on
 Twitter.


Uh
 TSM,
 wow,
 307.
 That's
 green.
 likely


because
 of
 ASML.
 Okay,
 so
 let's
 talk


ASML
 real
 quick.
 They
 missed
 on
 revenue,


but
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 line.
 That's


why
 they're
 up
 5%
 right
 here.
 They
 also


bought
 back
 a
 ton
 of
 shares.


Management's
 commentary
 was
 not
 like
 the


best
 commentary.
 It
 wasn't
 really
 on
 the


offensive
 when
 I
 was
 reading
 it.
 It
 was


a
 little
 bit
 more


Okay,
 I
 think
 we're
 back.
 Are
 we
 back?


Can
 you
 guys
 hear
 me?
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 uh


people
 can
 hear
 me.
 Dude,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 just
 happened.
 You
 guys
 can
 hear


me?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 No.


That
 was
 weird.


Let
 me
 know
 if
 people
 can
 hear
 me
 or


not.
 Yeah,
 my
 lights
 went
 out,
 bro.
 That


was


I
 don't
 know
 what's
 Yeah,
 maybe
 the
 nor


easter
 affecting
 some
 of
 the
 stuff.
 The


rain
 is
 not
 that
 heavy.
 Yes,
 we
 can
 hear


me.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.


Okay.


Our


building
 lost
 power
 to
 be
 honest.
 Um,


that
 is
 wild.
 But
 I
 think
 we're
 here.


The
 the
 the
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little


tough
 because
 my
 phone
 hotspot
 is
 not


Dude,
 this
 is
 trippy
 there.
 There's
 Let


me
 Let
 me
 hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 open
 the


windows
 a
 little
 bit.
 Let's
 get
 some


light
 in
 here.
 Let's
 see.


Okay,
 we
 have
 some
 lights
 a
 little
 bit.


Um,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 we
 lost
 power.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 we
 lost
 power.
 That
 is


very
 rear,


but
 that
 might
 end
 up
 hurting
 the
 entire


show
 to
 be
 honest.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 know
 if


you
 guys
 hear
 me
 in
 the
 chat.
 You
 should


be
 able
 to
 hear
 me.


the
 uh


I
 don't
 know
 why
 the
 power
 just
 went
 out


across
 the
 entire
 board.


That's
 weird,
 bro.
 That's
 super
 super


weird,
 dude.
 The
 bill
 is
 paid.
 It's
 not


about


able
 to.


We
 got
 five
 minutes
 until
 I
 don't
 know


run
 this
 off
 my
 phone.


Let
 me
 just
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 an
 update.


That
 is
 weird.


That
 is
 freaking
 weird.


The
 audio
 is
 crappy.
 Okay,
 hold
 on.
 Let


me
 Let
 me
 see
 this
 right
 here.
 Yeah,


it's
 it
 No,
 everyone
 lost
 power.


Everyone
 lost
 power.
 There's
 an
 app
 for


the
 building.
 It's
 not
 just
 me.
 It's
 uh


it's
 it's
 it's
 not
 my
 utilities.


Yeah,
 guys.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 can
 do


the
 show,
 bro.
 I'm
 sorry.
 I
 know
 it


sucks.
 It
 looks
 bad,
 but
 the
 entire


building
 wall
 power
 the
 entire
 freaking


building.
 It's
 not
 just
 me.
 I
 mean,
 I


have
 my
 hotspot,
 but
 my
 hotspot
 is
 not


going
 to
 be


My
 hotspot's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best.


This
 is
 definitely
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


best.
 It's
 not
 raining
 that
 much


outside.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it
 would
 be
 a


noraster
 thing,
 though.


Yeah,
 guys.
 I
 I
 think
 we
 I
 think


do
 it
 anyway.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 work,
 bro.
 The
 I
 mean,
 I
 can
 stay
 on


as
 long
 as
 I
 think
 the
 hotspot
 holds
 up,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 hotspot's
 going
 to


hold
 up.


It's
 an
 audio
 show.
 You
 can't
 even
 see


the
 video.
 Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 Let
 me
 go
 up


to
 it.


Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah,
 the
 video's
 so
 crappy.


That
 sucks.
 That
 maybe
 without
 video.


No,
 but
 it's
 not
 worth
 it.
 If
 I
 share
 my


screen
 right
 here,


can
 you
 Let's
 see
 how
 it
 looks.
 Dude,


that's
 so
 weird,
 bro.
 Why
 is
 it
 Why
 is


the
 building
 acting
 like
 that?


Market
 S&P
 is
 still
 up
 a
 little
 bit


right
 here.
 Yeah,
 guys.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 I
 mean,
 if
 I
 go


through
 with
 it,
 it's
 probably
 just


going
 to
 crash
 in
 the
 middle
 because
 I


do
 not
 have
 a
 good
 hot
 spot
 here.
 I've


tried
 my
 hot
 hot
 spot
 before
 and
 it


sucks.
 Oh,
 hold
 on.
 I
 think
 power
 just


came
 back.
 I
 think
 power
 just
 came
 back.


My
 Yep.
 No,
 I
 think
 it
 just
 came
 back.
 I


think


I
 think
 we
 get
 to
 do
 it.
 My
 laptop's


charging.
 That
 means
 power
 likely
 came


back.
 I
 think
 Yep,
 we
 got
 it,
 baby.
 We


got
 it.
 There
 we
 go.
 There
 we
 go.
 Okay,


cool.
 Well,
 that's
 a
 uh
 that's
 a
 first


on
 the
 show.
 Let's
 Yep,
 there
 we
 go.
 All


right,
 so
 let
 me
 do
 it
 right
 in
 time.


Okay,
 let
 me
 switch
 back
 to
 my
 regular


Wi-Fi


and
 then
 it'll
 it'll
 be
 flat
 for
 a


second.


Dude,
 that's
 wild.
 Two
 minutes
 right


before
 we
 did
 it,
 Joe.


I
 don't
 even
 know.
 Okay,
 the
 Wi-Fi


should
 be
 back
 in
 a
 second
 and
 then


we'll
 switch
 on
 to
 a
 better
 Wi-Fi.


We
 do
 have
 one
 minute.
 Dude,
 I
 paid
 my


freaking


deducted.


So


that's
 wild
 though,
 bro.


Let's
 see.
 Okay,
 Wi-Fi
 is
 coming
 back


right
 before
 we
 open.
 Give
 it
 a
 second.


Let
 pull
 this
 up.
 We're
 going
 to
 connect


in
 a
 minute.


It's
 coming
 back.
 Coming
 back.
 Coming


back.
 Give
 it
 two
 seconds.


um


should
 be
 coming
 in
 a
 second.
 A
 couple


of
 them
 are
 loading.


Once
 this
 loads
 up,
 I
 think
 we're
 be


going
 to
 be
 okay.
 We
 got
 the
 market
 open


and
 yeah,
 my
 wife
 on
 my
 phone
 is
 just


coming
 back.


Okay,
 there
 it
 is.
 Let's
 see.


So
 random,
 bro.
 So
 freaking
 random.


Okay,
 it's
 back
 on
 my
 phone.
 Not
 back
 on


my
 computer
 yet.
 So,
 I
 still
 probably


look
 like
 a
 potato.
 But
 are
 we
 going
 to


get
 a
 market
 open
 in
 a
 second?
 Are
 we


going to
 get
 a
 Oh,
 there
 it
 is.
 There
 it


is.
 Okay,
 give
 it
 one
 second.
 It's
 about


to
 go
 black
 for
 a
 second.


There
 we
 go.
 All
 right,
 we're
 back.
 The


stock
 market


is
 now
 open.


All


right,
 folks.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it
 and
 wake


your
 ass
 up.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Uh
 S&P
 666.


That's
 up
 about
 1.61%.
 We
 are
 green
 on


the
 day
 for
 the
 S&P.
 That's
 down
 a


little
 bit
 from
 the
 pre-market,
 but
 we


are
 still
 green.
 S&P
 that
 is
 up
 grabby


grab
 3%.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 breaking
 through


above
 that
 $6
 range.
 611
 right
 there
 at


3.38%
 on
 grab.
 We
 are
 green
 for
 that.


AMD
 222
 that
 is
 also
 green.
 That's
 up


about
 2.08%.
 Nvidia
 that's
 up
 2%
 on
 the


day.
 Tesla
 that
 goes
 2%.
 We
 are
 pretty


much
 green
 across
 the
 board.
 Reddit's
 up


3%.
 Amazon's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.
 Meta's


green.
 Salesforce
 is
 green.
 PayPal's
 up.


ELF
 is
 up.
 Apple's
 up.
 SMCI
 is
 up
 3%.


Unfortunately,
 Bitmine
 is
 slightly
 down.


Ethereum's
 down.
 Actually,
 BitMine's


down
 from
 the
 pre-market,
 but
 it's
 still


up
 1.6%.
 Oaklo,
 how's
 that
 doing?


Oaklow.
 Wow.
 7%


on
 an
 Oaklow.
 That
 one
 continues
 to
 move


higher.
 Look
 at
 that.
 188.
 It's
 going


for
 200.
 It
 is
 eventually
 going
 for
 200,


but
 that
 one
 right
 there
 is
 green.
 I


ran.
 Is
 it
 past
 74?
 I
 ran
 7267.
 So,
 down


from
 74,
 but
 that's
 still
 up
 about
 4.5%


on
 the
 day.
 Just
 below
 that
 73
 level.
 It


looks
 like
 that
 one
 wants
 to
 break


through
 to
 75.
 Nvidia,
 that's
 up
 1.8%.


SoFi,
 that's
 up
 2%.
 Grab
 right
 there
 up


2.7.
 Amazon
 basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day.


Robin
 Hood
 up
 2%
 13780
 and
 then
 pounder


18265.


Pounder
 is
 also
 green.
 Archer
 is
 that


moving
 today.
 Archer
 wow
 1419
 must
 be


some
 catalyst
 right
 there
 that's
 getting


the
 street
 excited
 about
 Archer
 up
 9%
 on


the
 day.
 We'll
 see
 what
 the
 catalyst


looks
 like
 in
 a
 second
 as
 I
 pull
 that


up.
 But
 Archer
 right
 there
 is
 also
 green


and
 you
 are
 getting
 some
 momentum
 on


that.
 That's
 up
 9.5%.


Where
 is
 Nebius?
 Nebius
 right
 here
 131


that's
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Um
 Richtech


Robotics
 RR
 that
 one
 also
 goes
 green
 3%


trying
 to
 break
 through
 $7
 hit
 up
 seven


for
 a
 second.
 BMR
 back
 down
 to
 5303


potentially
 going
 below
 53.
 So
 you
 got
 a


red
 candle
 right
 there
 potentially


getting
 some
 shares
 that
 are
 being


dumped
 as
 that
 one
 is
 going
 down.
 Archer


announced
 it
 will
 acquire
 a
 Liam's


portfolio
 of
 300
 air
 mobility
 patent


assets
 for
 $18
 million
 euros.
 The
 assets


cover
 high
 voltage
 systems,
 battery


management,
 and
 aircraft
 design.
 All


right,
 so
 Lilium,
 which
 already
 went


bankrupt
 a
 while
 ago,
 looks
 like
 Archer


is
 going
 to
 be
 acquiring
 a
 big
 part
 of


their
 business,
 and
 that's
 why
 that


stock
 is
 up
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 mean,
 it


makes
 sense
 Archer
 is
 getting
 another


asset
 from
 a
 company
 that
 is
 a


competitor
 to
 them
 or
 was
 a
 competitor


to
 them.
 Um,
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


that
 Archer
 has
 earnings
 or
 revenue
 yet,


but
 it
 does
 mean
 they
 get
 a
 lot
 closer


to
 that
 by
 value
 by,
 you
 know,
 acquiring


some
 pretty
 strong
 intellectual
 property


and
 some
 patents
 right
 there.
 So,
 that's


why
 Archer
 is
 getting
 the
 boost.
 IWM


that's
 up
 1%.
 Walmart
 that's
 up
 1%.
 VIX


is
 down
 6.3.
 Nice
 to
 see
 VIX
 taking
 a


hit
 from
 that
 $21
 level
 that
 it
 was
 at


yesterday.
 SoFi,
 look
 at
 that
 29.


Finally
 getting
 back
 above
 29.
 That
 one


probably
 wants
 to
 get
 into
 the
 30s
 once


again.
 It
 will
 be
 nice
 to
 see
 it
 get


there.
 ASML
 right
 now,
 125.
 That's
 up


4.3%.
 S&P
 still
 up
 about
 1%
 66703.


Robin
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 40
 or
 140.


And
 then
 pounder,
 look
 at
 that.
 Pounder


2.23.
 23.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 option
 flow


next
 week
 for
 the
 190
 call
 on
 Palanteer.


Uh
 we
 have
 earnings
 on
 November
 3rd
 that


was
 announced
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 I
 do


think
 if
 they
 have
 a
 50%
 quarter,
 you


know,
 190
 is
 very
 possible
 to
 break


through.
 But
 you
 do
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 betting
 on
 190
 for
 uh
 Pounder.


APLD,
 that
 stock
 is
 up
 5.7%
 on
 the
 day.


How
 about
 AS?
 Are
 we
 still
 at
 99?
 9819.


Looks
 like
 this
 bad
 boy
 really
 does
 want


100.
 And
 then
 Rocklab
 back
 above
 71.


7153
 is
 green.
 Now,
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 for


those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,
 absolutely


destroyed
 earnings.
 Look
 at
 that.
 They


deserve
 6%.
 They
 beat
 EPS
 by
 35%.


You
 just
 don't
 tend
 to
 do
 that
 if
 you're


a
 bank,
 unless
 you're
 SoFi.
 Uh
 Morgan


Stanley
 doing
 incredible.
 That's
 up


6.4%.
 They
 also
 beat
 on
 revenue
 by
 about


a
 billion
 and
 a
 half.
 And
 Bank
 of


America,
 that's
 up
 another
 four
 and a


half
 percent
 because
 they
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 as
 well.
 So,
 you're


getting
 the
 banks,
 whether
 it's
 City,


Black
 Rockck,
 Wells
 Fargo,
 etc.
 doing


their
 thing.
 AMD
 right
 there
 225.
 AMD


hit
 240
 last
 week.
 It's
 nice
 to
 see
 it


hold
 above
 the
 220s
 right
 here.
 A
 dip
 to


the
 low
 200s
 is
 I
 think
 where
 dip
 buyers


get
 excited.
 180s
 is
 where
 people
 really


get
 excited.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you're


going to
 get
 that.
 Don't
 know
 if
 you're


going
 to
 get
 that
 after
 that
 opening


ideal.
 That
 one
 might
 continue
 to
 allow


it
 to
 go
 higher.
 Oaklo
 186
 that's
 up


6.82.
 SMR
 that's
 up
 6.8%.
 And
 then


Nanuclear


that
 is
 up
 5%
 as
 well
 on
 the
 day.
 AMKR


are
 we
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 run


there?
 30.84
 84.
 That's
 up
 3%
 on
 the


day.
 By
 the
 way,
 we
 will
 have
 another


Twitter
 spaces
 today
 uh
 with
 uh
 Stock


Talk
 uh
 for
 Equity
 Edge,
 the
 new
 like


audio
 show
 that
 we
 do
 every
 Wednesday.


Uh
 ENS
 is
 the
 ticker.
 ENS
 is
 the
 ticker.


I
 do
 not
 have
 a
 position
 in
 this
 ticker.


Uh
 he
 does,
 but
 ENS
 is
 an
 energy
 company


specifically
 in
 battery
 and
 battery


production
 and
 energy
 storage.
 So,
 we'll


be
 talking
 about
 this
 one
 today.
 Another


small
 cap
 in
 the
 energy
 space.
 A
 lot
 of


those
 are
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 attention.


So,
 we'll
 be
 deep
 diving
 on
 ENS
 today.


Robinet
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 2%.


Pounder
 up
 2%.
 Grab
 606,
 that's
 up
 2.04.


SoFi
 2.48.
 And
 then
 AMD
 up
 3%.
 ASML


again,
 decent.
 Oh,
 that's
 the
 last
 thing


we
 were
 talking
 about
 before
 the
 power


went
 out.
 Uh,
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 is


management
 basically
 said
 we
 don't


expect
 a
 significant
 decline
 of
 revenue


in
 2026,
 but
 they
 also
 didn't
 say
 we


expect
 a
 significant
 acceleration
 in


revenue
 in
 2026.
 So
 ASML
 I
 don't
 think


is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 gauge
 the
 overall


semiconductor
 ecosystem
 for
 a
 demand.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 ways
 to
 gauge
 it,


but
 they,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 they
 would


be
 up
 a
 lot
 more
 if
 they
 increase
 their


forecast
 and
 they
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 defensive
 tone
 on
 the
 earnings
 call


around
 the
 concept
 of
 like
 revenue


beats,
 but
 you
 know,
 stock
 still
 had
 a


pretty
 good
 earnings
 and
 that's
 why
 that


stock's
 up
 3.4%.
 They
 also
 bought
 back
 a


ton
 of
 shares
 at
 650
 euros.
 You
 know,


stocks
 way
 above
 that
 right
 now.
 So
 they


did
 a
 really
 good
 buyback
 about
 four


months
 ago.
 Wow.
 Rocket
 Lab
 72
 72
 on


Rocket
 Lab.
 Not
 bad.
 7350
 was
 the


all-time
 high.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 some


love


on
 Rocket
 Lab
 for
 today.
 LEU,
 Centric


Energy,
 that
 one
 also
 goes
 green
 433.


That's
 up
 9.4%


on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 Bit
 Farms,
 this
 was


650.
 This
 is
 now
 633.
 That's
 still
 up


about
 7.3%.


as
 we
 get
 into
 this
 market
 open.
 Nvidia


still
 up
 by
 about
 1.63.
 Nvidia
 did
 get


upgraded
 again
 by
 HSBC
 to
 320.
 Massive


street
 high
 price
 target
 compared
 to


Caner
 at
 300.
 They
 upgraded
 then
 from


200
 to
 320
 as
 well.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 pretty


large
 uh
 upgrade,
 but
 that
 stock
 losing


a
 little
 bit
 of
 its
 pre-market
 action


now
 down
 or
 now
 up
 only
 1.5%.
 Now
 again,


the
 soybean
 comment
 was
 the
 thing
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 thought
 might
 affect


the
 market
 today.
 The
 market
 seems
 to


not
 care.
 It
 seems
 like
 soybeans
 were
 a


thing
 of
 12
 hours
 in
 the
 after
 hours


yesterday.
 It
 definitely
 wasn't
 the
 best


to
 see
 that,
 but
 you're
 not
 getting
 that


much
 excitement
 or
 momentum
 on
 soybeans.


I
 mean,
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 market's


ignoring
 it
 and
 the
 market's
 like,
 you


know
 what,
 Trump,
 if
 you
 want to
 get


into
 a
 fight
 about
 soybeans,
 be
 our


guest.
 But
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 take
 it


seriously.


Which
 is
 also


nice
 to
 see.
 SM
 or
 SMR,
 that's
 up
 10%


again
 on
 that
 Janis
 program
 that
 the


army
 talked
 about
 today
 with
 nuclear


energy.
 That's
 what's
 creating
 a


catalyst
 for
 all
 the
 nuclear
 stocks.
 How


about
 rare
 earths?
 US
 AR,
 wow,
 down
 10%.


Is
 MP
 down
 10%
 as
 well?
 MP
 is
 down
 4%.


All right,
 so
 rare
 earths
 are
 taking
 a


little bit
 of a
 breather
 today.
 TMQ,


that
 one's
 also
 down
 10%.


Um,


what
 are
 the
 other
 ones?
 The
 There
 was


another
 one
 that
 was
 not
 TAC.
 TAC
 is
 up


2.6,
 but
 there
 was
 another
 rare
 earth.


Oh,
 CRML.
 How
 about
 that
 one?
 That's


also
 down
 14%.
 Wow.


the
 rare
 earths.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


headline.
 I
 think
 they
 kind
 of
 people


just
 woke
 up
 and
 took
 some
 profits
 right


here.
 But
 all
 of
 them
 getting
 hit
 across


the
 board
 by
 double
 digits.


SLNH
 is
 that
 one
 also
 getting
 hit.


That's
 up
 well
 that's
 up
 32%.
 That's


more
 of
 a
 data
 center
 play.
 That's
 going


green.
 Roblox
 is
 up
 5%.


And
 LAC,
 how
 about
 Lithium
 America's?


That
 one
 is
 up
 about
 1%.
 All right,
 so


the
 rare
 earths
 are
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a


breather.
 Energy
 still
 holding
 strong.


Crypto
 names
 doing
 okay.
 Circle's
 up


1.6%.
 Palo
 Alto's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 the


cyber
 security
 space.
 Micro
 Strategy
 is


flat.
 Micro
 Strategy
 a
 dollar
 away
 from


going
 below
 300o.
 Unfortunately,
 MSTR


has
 just
 been
 a
 disaster
 all
 year.
 I


mean,
 there's
 no
 way
 to
 slice
 it.
 MSTR


has
 sucked
 all
 year.
 And
 if
 Bitcoin


doesn't
 make
 a
 move
 in
 the
 next
 two


months,
 it'll
 probably
 continue
 to
 be


stuck.
 But
 maybe
 Bitcoin
 makes
 that


move.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 below
 112
 and


Ethereum
 below
 4100.
 Is
 Oakllo
 190?


Oaklow
 is
 now
 191.


100
 191.
 The
 pair
 trade
 of
 the
 day.
 Long


soybeans,
 short
 rare
 earths.
 Exactly.
 Is


there
 a
 way
 to
 trade
 soybeans?
 Are
 there


soybean
 futures?
 Is
 there
 something
 to


navigate
 the
 soybeans
 or
 no?
 There's
 got


to
 be
 some
 proxy
 play
 to
 get
 there.
 ESTs


9740.
 Hims
 up
 2%.
 Then
 Uber
 up
 2%
 as


well.
 Uh
 I
 ran.
 Dude,
 what
 if
 I
 had
 a


power
 shortage
 because
 we
 have
 data


centers
 in
 New
 Jersey
 that
 are
 taking
 up


all
 the
 power?
 Could
 that
 be
 the
 reason?


That
 would
 be
 a
 bullish
 reason,
 though,


right?
 That'd
 be
 like,
 all right,


there's
 more
 AI
 demand.
 I'll
 have
 to


take
 one
 for
 the
 team.
 But,
 um,
 no,
 in


all
 seriousness,
 that
 that
 is
 kind
 of


crazy
 that
 we
 had
 the
 power
 outage.
 And


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 noraster,
 but
 who


knows?
 Maybe
 it's
 because
 the
 data


centers.
 I
 ran
 right
 there.
 7196
 down


from
 75,
 but
 still
 up
 3%.
 Oaklo
 breaking


through
 192.
 Quite
 incredible
 that


Oakllo's
 making
 this
 move.
 I
 mean,
 oh,


let
 me
 check
 the
 short
 float
 on
 Oakllo.


I
 think
 it's
 closer
 to
 20%.
 If
 it
 is,


and
 they
 announce
 any
 deal,
 14.7%.
 I


mean,
 if
 if
 if
 when
 you
 got
 that
 type
 of


short
 float
 and
 they
 were
 to
 announce
 a


potential
 billion
 dollar
 contract
 with


the
 Department
 of
 Energy,
 this
 thing's


probably
 blasting
 through
 200.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


expecting
 them
 to
 do.
 But,
 you
 know,


will
 they
 do
 that
 is
 the
 question.
 Dell


right
 there,
 that's
 up
 2.8%.
 8%
 as
 well


on


on
 the
 day.
 Um,
 so SB
 is
 that
 actually


No,
 wait.
 That
 Holy
 crap.
 That's
 a


That's
 a
 real
 thing.
 A
 soybean
 fund.


This
 is
 a
 real
 thing.
 SOB.


Year
 to
 date,
 it's
 flat.


Wow.
 It's
 a
 legit
 soybean
 fund.
 I
 did


not
 know
 that
 was
 a
 thing.


soybean
 ETF.
 There
 you
 go.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 It's
 a
 futures
 contract.


All right.
 Well,
 there
 you
 go.
 Yeah,
 we


need
 the
 10x
 leverage
 on
 soybeans.


That's
 what
 we
 actually
 need.
 Overall,


folks,
 this
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 S&P
 500


again,
 up
 about
 1%
 right
 here.
 We
 were


at
 673
 on
 Friday,
 fell
 all
 the
 way
 down


to
 647.
 We're
 back
 to
 667.
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 can
 be
 mad
 with
 the
 bit
 of
 a


Vshape
 that
 we've
 done
 over
 the
 past


three
 days.
 And
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 the


resilience
 in
 this
 market.
 You
 saw
 that


stat
 yesterday.
 108
 million
 option


contracts
 were
 traded
 the
 day
 of
 the


Trump
 China
 uh
 meltdown
 which
 was
 last


Friday.
 61
 million
 out
 of
 that
 108


million
 were
 call
 options.
 So
 people


double
 down
 during
 the
 uh
 the
 draw
 down


and
 people
 bought
 more
 and
 as
 a
 result


you're
 seeing
 that
 action
 as
 we
 get
 more


momentum.
 Quantum
 continues
 to
 run.
 QBTS


wow
 up
 another
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 You've
 got


a
 lot
 of
 people
 on
 Twitter,
 at
 least
 the


chatter
 that
 I'm
 seeing,
 asking
 when
 do


they
 short
 Quantum,
 when
 do
 they,
 you


know,
 buy
 puts
 on
 Quantum.


I
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 that


question.
 And
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 it's


worth
 taking
 the
 risk.
 As
 a
 hedge,
 I


think
 sure,
 because
 as
 a
 hedge,
 you
 want


to
 go
 short
 or
 buy
 puts
 on
 something


that
 is
 speculative
 and
 if
 it,
 you
 know,


if
 the
 market
 goes
 down,
 that
 likely


goes
 down.
 But
 dude,
 we
 had
 a
 3%
 draw


down
 on
 Friday
 and
 the
 best
 hedge
 was


like
 Nvidia
 puts.
 It
 wasn't
 even
 quantum


puts.
 Like
 quantum
 and
 nuclear
 didn't


even
 get
 hit
 that
 bad
 on
 the
 first
 3%


draw
 down
 we
 had
 in
 seven
 months.
 So


it's
 like
 is
 it
 even
 a
 good
 hedge?
 I


mean
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 These
 stocks


have
 taken
 a
 life
 of
 their
 own.
 Their


narratives
 have
 taken
 a
 life
 of
 their


own.
 And
 it
 it's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 that


the
 narratives
 die
 overnight.
 But
 do


they
 die
 eventually?
 Maybe.
 Maybe
 not.


But
 if
 they
 do
 die
 eventually,
 are
 you


going to
 be
 right
 on
 the
 timing
 of
 the


short
 if
 that
 takes
 place?
 Open
 door


right
 there.
 That's
 also
 down
 about


1.68%


on
 the
 day.
 The
 IV
 is
 too
 high
 for


quantum
 puts.
 Not
 worth
 it.
 That's


another
 thing.
 And
 the
 premiums
 are


pretty
 damn
 high
 because
 you
 got
 a
 lot


of
 people
 bidding
 for
 those
 puts,
 which


means
 your
 riskreward
 might
 not
 be
 the


best.
 Meta
 right
 there,
 720


getting
 back
 into
 that
 720
 level.
 This


fell
 to
 690
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.
 And


then
 the
 S&P


still
 holding
 667.
 Uh
 Sam
 Alman


announced
 yesterday
 that
 ChatgBT
 is


working
 on
 let's
 just
 call
 it
 adult


features
 and
 uh
 they
 will
 be
 beginning


to
 implement
 that
 towards
 the
 bottom


half
 of
 2026.
 I
 was
 quite
 surprised
 when


I
 saw
 him
 publicly
 tweet
 that
 they
 are


working
 on
 you
 guys
 know
 what
 I'm


talking
 about
 adult
 features
 of
 chat
 GBT


because
 I
 mean
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 know


some
 of
 the
 most
 visited
 websites
 on
 the


planet
 are
 some
 of
 those
 adult
 websites


and
 the
 fact
 that
 chat
 GBT
 is
 saying
 we


think
 this
 is
 a
 vertical
 that
 we
 want
 to


use
 our
 precious
 GPUs
 from
 AMD
 and


Nvidia
 and
 Broadcom
 to
 focus
 on
 it's


quite
 incredible.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really


didn't
 think
 they
 would
 go
 down
 that


route,
 but
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 much


Sam
 Alman
 believes
 that
 chatbt
 or
 AI
 in


general
 will
 overtake
 every
 element
 of


the
 internet,
 including
 social.
 They're,


you
 know,
 they
 launched
 the
 Tik
 Tok


competitor,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 the


fastest
 growing
 app
 to
 a
 million
 users.


It
 took
 four
 days.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it's


growing
 like
 crazy.
 It's
 still
 number


one
 on
 the
 app
 store
 and
 it
 looks
 like


more
 and
 more
 verticals
 is
 what
 they're


going
 to
 be
 what
 they're
 going to
 be


attacking
 which
 is
 not
 really
 going
 to


help
 the
 reproduction
 problem
 and


population
 issue
 that
 we're
 having


globally
 but
 nonetheless
 that's
 another


use
 case
 for
 AI.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 got


there.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 431
 Nvidia


continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 Uh
 this
 is
 what


Basen
 said
 today
 when
 he
 was
 asked
 about


the
 government
 shutdown.
 We
 are
 still
 in


I
 think
 today
 is
 day
 14
 of
 the


government
 shutdown.
 Here
 is
 what
 Bent


had
 to
 say
 this
 morning
 when
 asked
 about


how
 long
 it
 will
 continue
 to
 last.


I
 mean,
 is
 that
 how
 this
 ends?
 It's


we're
 on
 day
 15
 and
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like


there's
 any
 sign
 of
 a
 deal.


Well,
 there
 there's
 there's
 a
 thought


out
 there
 that
 they're
 at least
 waiting


to
 this
 crazy
 no
 kings
 rally
 this


weekend,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 the


farthest
 left,
 the
 hardest
 core,
 uh
 the


most
 unhinged
 in
 the
 Democratic
 party,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 a
 big
 title.
 And
 you


know,
 no
 kings
 equal
 no
 paychecks.
 Uh
 we


are
 paying
 our
 military
 today.
 Uh
 the


Pentagon
 went
 into
 uh
 surplus
 funds
 and


will
 be
 able
 to
 make
 paychecks.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 the
 other
 problem


now
 is
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 mainstream


media.
 If
 this
 were
 Republicans
 who'


shut
 down
 the
 government,
 there
 would


have
 been
 screaming.
 There
 would
 have


been
 examples
 of
 things
 going
 wrong.
 But


because
 it's
 the
 Democrats,
 they're


complicit.
 And
 like
 like
 I
 said,
 if


moderate
 Republican
 senators
 come
 across


the
 aisle,
 they
 will
 be
 heroes.
 They


need
 to
 break
 away
 from
 the
 hive
 from


this
 radicalism.
 Chuck
 Schumer
 and
 Aake


Jeff,
 they
 call
 them
 two
 guys
 from


Brooklyn
 who
 are
 completely
 detached


from
 America.
 You
 know,
 we
 are
 hostage


to


Senator
 Schumer's
 poll
 numbers.


So
 again,
 Bent
 basically
 doing
 the
 blame


against
 Democrats,
 Democrats
 blaming


Republicans.
 I
 mean,
 it
 doesn't
 look


like
 there
 is
 an
 end
 in
 sight
 for
 the


blame
 game
 that
 they're
 playing,
 but


nonetheless,
 that's
 what
 they're
 doing.


Khi
 is
 estimating
 there's
 a
 30%
 chance,


by
 the
 way,
 S&P
 500
 new
 highs
 of
 the


day,
 66,750
 for
 a
 shutdown
 that
 will


last
 till
 November
 16th,
 which
 would
 be


the
 longest
 shutdown
 that
 we've
 seen.


Oh,
 we
 got
 a
 red
 candle
 right
 there
 on


the
 S&P.
 You
 guys
 see
 that?
 Oh,
 that


came
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 Let's
 see
 if
 that's


fake
 or
 if
 that's
 real.
 You
 guys
 see


that,
 right?
 That
 just
 popped
 right
 in


there.


just
 went
 down
 almost
 a
 buck
 right


there.
 Uh
 but
 they're
 estimating
 a
 30%


chance
 that
 that
 that
 uh
 there
 will
 be
 a


shutdown
 till
 November
 16th,
 which
 would


be
 one
 of the
 longest
 shutdowns
 we've


had
 in
 history.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


if
 that
 ends
 up
 happening,
 but
 it


doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 ending
 anytime


soon.
 Looks
 like
 that
 was
 a
 fake
 one.


Looks
 like
 that
 there's
 tons
 of
 fake


candles
 throughout
 the
 day.
 Sometimes


you
 would
 see
 some
 of
 these
 other
 stocks


get
 hit
 with
 the
 same
 red
 candle
 if
 the


S&P
 got
 hit
 with
 it.
 That
 could
 have


been
 a
 b
 a
 bunch
 of
 ghost
 orders
 just


going
 right
 through.
 But
 S&P
 still


holding
 66722


up
 1%


uh
 on
 the
 day.


Trump
 I
 don't
 think
 tweeted
 this


morning.
 Again
 the
 soybean
 thing
 that


was
 the
 big
 news
 yesterday.
 Looks
 like


markets
 have
 kind
 of
 moved
 on
 from
 it.


Nvidia
 though
 is
 losing
 any
 of
 the


momentum
 it
 had
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


Again,
 Nvidia
 and
 Black
 Rockck
 today


partnered
 to
 acquire
 uh
 a
 company
 uh


worth
 40
 billion
 specifically
 working
 on


Texas
 data
 centers.
 Nvidia
 is
 not


spending
 all
 40
 billion.
 They're


partnering
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 financial


institutions
 including
 BlackRock
 and
 the


Abu
 Dhabi
 MGPX
 fund,
 but
 uh
 they
 are


continuing
 to
 invest
 in
 more
 data


centers.
 And
 Cororeweave
 is
 partnering


with
 a
 AI
 startup
 to
 partner
 with
 Texas


AI
 to
 or
 to
 build
 Texas
 AI
 data
 centers.


Corey
 right
 here
 still
 down
 from
 the


pre-markets
 but
 up
 2.67%


on
 the
 day.
 So
 you
 still
 have
 tons
 of


data
 center
 news
 that's
 not
 really


slowing
 down
 and
 that
 continues
 to
 be


the
 bullcase
 for
 all
 these
 other
 smaller


companies
 that
 are
 winning.
 Ian
 is
 70.


That's
 losing
 its
 pre-market
 move,
 but


still
 up
 2%.
 Bit
 farms
 was
 up
 seven.
 Bit


farms
 is
 now
 up
 two.
 That's
 potentially


about
 to
 lose
 $6.
 CleanSpark
 was
 at
 21.


Clean
 Spark's
 now
 at
 22.
 So,
 Clean


Spark's
 doing
 okay.
 Terowolf
 is
 at
 15.


That's
 up
 1%.
 Is
 Olo
 still
 moving?
 Ollo


is
 185,
 down
 from
 193,
 but
 got
 all
 the


way
 up
 to
 193.
 And
 then
 Cipher
 was
 at


22.
 Cipher's
 at
 20.
 That's
 down
 from
 22.


Okay,
 the
 rare
 earths.
 Why
 do
 you
 guys


think
 they're
 falling?
 Is
 this
 just
 a


hey,
 they
 were
 running
 like
 crazy.
 They


needed
 a
 breather.
 Or
 is
 there
 something


more
 fundamental?


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 something


fundamental
 just
 given
 the
 fact
 that,


you
 know,
 we
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 rare
 earth


metals.
 But
 USA
 rare
 earths,
 that's
 down


15.
 MP
 is
 down
 seven.
 TMQ


is
 down
 14.
 My
 goodness.
 And
 then
 CRML


is
 down
 18.
 Holy
 guacamole.


That's
 not
 just
 a
 breather,
 bro.
 That's


like
 a
 That's
 a
 That's
 a
 oneif
 chop.
 20%


chop
 across
 the
 board.


S&P
 did
 lose
 667.
 So
 that
 red
 candle
 is


continuing.


I
 don't
 see
 any
 headline,
 but
 you
 are


seeing
 more
 red
 candles
 across
 the


board.
 Google
 got
 a
 red
 candle.
 So
 got
 a


red
 candle
 from
 29.
 Nvidia
 basically


losing
 most
 of
 its
 pre-market
 move


and
 that
 one's
 going
 down.
 ETH
 below
 4K.


Okay,
 so
 crypto
 is
 getting
 hit
 a
 little


bit.
 Well,
 it's
 not
 below
 4K
 yet.


It's
 got
 very
 close
 though.
 I
 don't
 see


a
 Trump
 post.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a


Trump
 post.
 Now,
 remember
 the
 like
 one


of the
 reasons
 I
 was
 pretty
 surprised


that
 the
 pre-markets
 were
 green
 is


because
 the
 soybean
 thing,
 look,
 is
 it


the
 biggest
 deal
 in
 the
 world?
 No.
 But


it
 is
 a
 reescalation
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 China


tensions
 and
 the
 market
 kind
 of
 just


forgot
 about
 it
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 got
 into


the
 pre-markets,
 which
 was
 a
 bit


surprising
 for
 me
 because
 they
 were
 so


upset
 about
 anything
 that
 had
 to
 do
 with


China
 on
 Friday.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 All


I'm
 saying
 is
 it's
 kind
 of
 weird
 that


the
 market
 doesn't
 care
 about
 soybeans


12
 hours
 later.
 It's
 not
 like
 it's
 un


it's
 unexplainable
 why
 they
 don't
 care


about
 it
 anymore,
 but
 they
 kind
 of


scoffed
 it
 off.
 And
 maybe
 you're
 getting


some
 red
 candles
 because
 they
 don't


scoff
 it
 off
 anymore.
 We're
 gonna
 have


to
 see.
 Bent's
 live
 on
 Bloomberg.
 Okay,


hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 we
 can
 get
 Bent
 in
 a
 second.


Oh,
 it's
 Bent
 talking
 right
 now.
 Ah,
 he


just
 said
 some
 China
 [ __ ]
 Okay,
 let
 me


see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 the
 live
 feed
 in
 a


second.
 Bent,
 we
 see
 with
 this
 Chinese


provoc
 provocative


why
 it's
 important
 to
 have
 Trump
 to
 have


emergency.
 Okay,
 so
 he's
 talking
 about


China.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 the
 feed.


Give
 me
 one
 second.


China
 provoking
 likely
 is
 the
 headline


right
 here


and
 that's
 what's
 causing


some
 of
 this
 pain.
 Um,


let's
 pull
 this
 up.


Uh,
 one
 second
 guys.
 The
 feed
 is
 not


loading


exactly
 here
 yet.


Yeah,
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 Bent.
 It's
 got
 to


be
 Mr.
 Bent.


Okay,
 he's
 on
 Bloomberg.
 I
 gota
 sit


through
 an
 ad.
 Give
 it
 20
 seconds.
 It'll


sit
 through
 an
 ad
 and
 it'll
 be
 there.


Um,
 back
 to
 667
 on
 the
 S&P.
 HUT
 is
 uh


Eric
 Jackson's
 new
 stock.
 He
 said
 it
 can


uh
 go
 to
 500
 billion
 in
 market
 cap


yesterday.
 HUD
 8
 Mining,
 that
 Bitcoin


miner.
 Yesterday
 he
 tweeted
 that
 Hut


will
 be
 a
 $500
 billion
 market
 cap
 in
 a


couple
 years.
 So
 that
 is
 his
 new


uh
 100x
 bagger


that
 he
 is
 going
 for.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Okay,
 hold
 on.


Bent's
 not
 on
 Bloomberg.
 He's
 not
 on


Bloomberg.
 Okay,
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


maybe
 there's
 not
 a
 live
 feed
 of
 Bent


right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 we
 had
 him
 at
 the


CNBC
 conference,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 live
 on


Bloomberg.
 Let's
 go
 to
 him
 right
 here


and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 anything
 more
 from


what
 was
 happening
 with
 China.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 our
 European


allies,
 with
 Australia,


with
 Canada,
 with
 India
 and
 the
 Asian


democracies.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


wholesome
 group
 uh
 response
 to
 this


because
 bureaucrats
 in
 China
 cannot


manage
 the
 supply
 chain
 or
 the


manufacturing
 process
 for
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world.


What
 is
 a
 fullsum
 response?
 What
 does


that
 mean?


Uh
 we
 we
 have
 uh
 lot
 lots
 of
 levers.


Okay,
 this
 is
 the
 feed
 where
 he's
 live


on
 right
 now.
 This
 is
 the
 feed
 that's


causing
 some
 of
 the
 comments
 right
 here


uh
 to
 to
 manage
 the
 flow
 of
 information


uh
 rule
 of
 law
 with
 respect
 to
 political


opponents
 in
 Brazil.
 And
 so


of
 the
 ter
 we
 have
 a
 20%


fentanol
 tariff
 on
 China
 and
 again
 they


have
 all
 but
 admitted
 that
 they
 sell
 the


precursor
 drugs.
 When
 we
 have
 the


discussion,
 they
 take
 off
 the
 tariff
 and


then
 we
 can
 fix
 it.
 We
 say
 fix
 it
 and


show
 us
 six
 months
 of
 persistent


persistence
 and
 then
 we
 will
 take
 off


the
 tariff.
 So
 again,
 back
 to
 the
 IEPA,


if


100,000
 200,000
 Americans
 being
 killed


every
 year
 by
 fentanyl,
 families
 ruined


is
 not
 an
 emergency.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what


is.
 And
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 the
 Chinese


can
 cut
 off
 rare
 earths
 and
 export


control
 them,
 they
 certainly
 can
 control


the
 precursors
 for
 fentanyl
 as
 well.


Very
 quickly,
 very
 quickly,
 when
 the


history
 of
 this
 time
 is
 written,
 um,
 and


historians
 are
 paying
 attention
 to


President
 Trump's
 decision-m
 surrounding


the
 global
 tariff
 program
 that
 he
 has


initiated.
 Can
 you
 tell
 us
 to
 your


knowledge
 when
 it
 was
 whether
 it
 was


during
 the
 campaign
 or
 the


Oh,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 decision
 was
 taken
 in


the
 first
 term
 and
 you
 would
 have
 seen


President
 Trump
 saying
 that
 over
 the


past
 the
 since
 January
 20th
 that
 he


would
 have
 he
 had
 a
 very
 successful


tariff
 program
 on
 China
 in
 terms
 of


rebalancing
 in
 terms
 of
 purchases
 that


they
 were
 supposed
 to
 make
 which
 they


haven't
 followed
 up
 on.
 But
 you
 could


you
 heard
 President
 Trump
 say
 that
 in


his
 in
 his
 final
 year,
 the
 trade
 deal


was
 reached
 with
 China
 on
 January
 20th.


He
 was
 going
 to
 expand
 the
 tariffs
 to


the
 world.
 And
 then
 COVID
 hit
 and
 out
 of


humanitarian
 necessity.
 It
 would
 not


have
 been
 appropriate
 to
 start
 putting


on
 tariffs
 during
 a
 period
 of
 such
 great


economic
 disruption.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 not
 that
 many
 crazy


comments
 by
 Bent.
 Whatever
 he
 is
 saying


is
 getting
 AMD
 to
 get
 a
 boost
 right


here.
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline,
 folks.
 I


just
 see
 AMD
 moving
 above
 230,
 which
 is


pretty
 incredible.
 I
 mean,
 they
 got
 a


couple
 price
 target
 upgrades
 today,
 but


that
 was
 news
 that
 was
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 I
 guess
 that's
 being


factored
 in
 right
 now.
 S&P
 trying
 to
 go


for
 668.


Um,
 I
 guess
 Basen
 had
 some
 comments


about
 China
 being
 a
 little
 bit
 more


aggressive
 and
 the
 market
 that
 that
 that


red
 candle
 we
 saw
 across
 the
 board.


Again,
 they
 care
 for
 a
 second
 and
 then


they
 didn't
 care.
 I
 mean,
 this
 market


continues
 to
 be
 pretty
 resilient.
 The


exact
 quote
 from
 Bent
 was
 Chinese


officials
 said
 that
 China
 will
 cause


global
 chaos
 if
 port
 shipping
 fees
 go


through
 and
 if
 China
 wants
 to
 be
 an


unreliable
 partner
 for
 the
 world,
 we


need
 to
 decouple.


Those
 are
 not
 necessarily
 the
 most


bullish
 statements,
 but
 none
 but
 I
 think


Algo
 just
 heard
 those
 and
 just
 randomly


sold
 off
 stocks.
 Not
 randomly,
 but
 they


sold
 off
 stocks
 because,
 you
 know,
 they


interpreted
 betense
 words
 as
 China
 bad


stock
 market
 go
 down,
 which
 is
 kind
 of


how
 these
 algos
 work
 sometimes.
 But
 it's


not
 like
 people
 care
 that
 much
 about


those
 words.
 S&P
 668,
 AMD,
 WOW
 231.


I
 mean,
 he
 didn't
 say
 anything
 that


aggressive
 where
 you
 would
 think
 it's


escalating
 to
 such
 a
 degree,


but
 whatever
 he
 said
 was
 enough
 to
 give


us
 some
 red
 candles
 and
 the
 market
 is


overlooking
 that
 or
 people
 are
 coming
 in


and
 buying
 the
 dip.
 AMD
 right
 here
 232


almost.
 Tesla
 is
 up
 1%.
 Yeah,
 the


sentiment
 analysis
 probably
 on
 what
 he


was
 saying
 ended
 up
 being
 bearish
 which


caused
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 sell-off.
 It


might
 continue
 to
 cause
 some
 pain,
 but


whatever
 selloff
 is
 happening
 is
 getting


eaten
 up
 really
 quickly.
 Look
 at
 Na'vi


17%
 on
 the
 day.


17%
 on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 has
 nothing
 to
 do


with
 BENT.
 This
 one
 just
 looks
 like
 that


price
 target
 upgrade
 is
 taking
 it


higher.
 It
 got
 a
 280
 price
 target
 by
 by


Wedbush
 and
 uh
 it
 got
 a
 310
 price
 target


by


um
 by
 HSBC.
 HSBC
 gave
 Nvidia
 320,
 AMD


310.
 So
 I
 guess
 both
 of
 those
 together


are
 helping
 AMD.
 Symbotic,
 that
 stock
 is


up
 6%
 as
 well.
 7858.
 That's
 a
 robotics


company.
 So
 five
 right
 there.
 Trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 29.
 Where's
 gold?
 We
 didn't


check
 gold
 yet.
 Gold
 is
 at
 Wow.
 4,200.


When
 did
 gold
 get
 to
 4,200?


Oh
 my.
 Silver
 is
 at
 51.
 Goodness


gracious,
 bro.


Commodities
 not
 slowing
 down.


Commodities
 not
 slowing
 down.
 S&P
 668.


We
 didn't
 get
 to
 talk
 about
 what
 JP
 said


yesterday.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a


second.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 it


right
 before
 the
 power
 went
 out,
 but
 uh


I
 think
 the
 reason
 gold
 is
 going
 up
 is


likely
 because
 of
 what
 JPAL
 said


yesterday
 and
 probably
 why
 the
 S&P
 is


going
 up
 as
 well
 and
 maybe
 ignoring
 some


of
 the
 soybean
 stuff.
 JPAL
 was
 pretty


damn
 dovish
 on
 the
 idea
 of
 uh
 not


engaging
 in
 quantitative
 tightening
 as


much
 as
 they
 were
 in
 the
 past
 and
 that


could
 be
 a
 signal
 to
 the
 markets
 to
 go


higher.
 S&P
 on
 track
 for
 a
 1%
 day,


folks.
 We
 would
 be
 $3
 away
 from
 all-time


highs
 which
 is
 where
 we
 were
 on
 Friday.


I
 mean,
 you
 had
 some
 people
 saying
 it


might
 take
 a
 couple
 months
 to
 recover
 to


all-time
 highs.
 It's
 been
 less
 than
 a


week,
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 get
 to


alltime
 highs,
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 it's


completely
 out
 of
 the
 picture
 given
 this


move.
 That's
 a
 0.92%


on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 still
 moving
 230,
 down


from
 232,
 but
 that
 gets
 a
 5%
 move.
 Um


AMD
 right
 here
 in
 terms
 of
 market
 cap


is
 moving
 about
 15
 billion
 today
 as
 that


one
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Adobe,
 how's


Adobe,
 Salesforce
 and
 PayPal
 doing?


Adobe
 right
 here
 that's
 down.
 Salesforce


even
 after
 the
 OpenAI
 partnership
 really


hasn't
 made
 a
 move.
 That's
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 And
 then
 PayPal
 broke
 75
 now
 back


below
 70.
 69.45


is
 what
 you
 have
 on
 PayPal.
 VG
 this
 one


fell
 below
 9
 bucks.
 It
 is
 954.
 That's
 up


6%.
 So
 you
 got
 some
 buyers
 coming
 in


next
 decade
 as
 well
 fell
 below
 six
 bucks


yesterday.
 That
 stock
 638
 that's
 up


3.14%.


Okay.
 So
 Bent
 said
 some
 stuff
 that
 was


kind
 of
 bearish.
 China
 market
 seems
 to


not
 care
 that
 much.
 Um
 and
 then
 in
 terms


of
 the
 government
 shutdown,
 he
 continued


to
 blame
 the
 Democrats.
 Markets
 also


continue
 to
 not
 care
 that
 much
 even
 with


the
 shutdown
 odds
 increasing
 to
 November


16th.


I
 guess
 the
 story
 of
 the
 day
 is
 Bank
 of


America
 and
 Morgan
 Stanley
 crush
 Nvidia


and
 AMD
 continue
 to
 get
 more
 upgrades


signaling
 more
 data
 center
 growth
 and


the
 Vshape
 potentially
 continues
 to
 be


in
 play
 as
 buyers
 come
 in.
 Look
 at
 I


rent
 7285.
 It
 dipped
 down
 to
 70
 right


back
 to
 that
 73
 level.
 How
 about
 Energy


Fuels?
 That
 stock
 is
 up
 2%.
 Rare
 Earths


are
 they
 still
 getting
 hit?


US
 AR
 a
 little
 V-shaped
 still
 down
 11%.


MP
 uh
 down
 five,
 it
 was
 down
 10.
 CRML


was
 down
 25,
 now
 it's
 down
 14.


And
 then
 TMQ
 was
 down
 18.
 TMQ
 is
 now


down
 13.
 So
 you
 do
 have
 a
 bounce


on
 a
 lot
 of
 those.


S&P
 very
 close
 to
 669.


Very
 close
 to
 669.
 SMR
 also
 getting
 a


big
 move.
 Wow.
 20%


on
 new
 scale
 power.
 That
 means
 Oaklo


should
 be
 green
 with
 it.
 Oaklo's
 up
 7%


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 190.
 This
 likely


is
 on
 the
 army
 headline
 around
 them


instituting
 a
 program
 for
 nuclear


energy.


And
 those
 stories
 are
 enough
 to
 take


these
 stocks
 higher.
 Tesla,
 are
 we


making
 a
 move
 on
 Tessie?


435.
 Okay.


uh
 bottomed
 out
 around
 4:30
 15
 minutes


ago.
 The
 heat
 map
 should
 be
 green
 today.


Heat
 map
 across
 the
 board.
 Yeah,
 look
 at


this
 dude.
 The
 only
 thing
 that's
 red.


There's
 like
 seven
 stocks
 that
 are
 red


and
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 red
 are
 barely


red.
 Netflix
 barely
 down.
 Adobe
 barely


down.
 Berkshire
 barely
 down.
 Insurance


is
 really
 getting
 hit.
 Progressive,
 they


had
 earnings
 today.
 I
 guess
 progressive


didn't
 have
 the
 best
 earnings.
 That's


down
 7%.


Everything
 else
 is
 green.


Everything
 else
 is
 green.
 And
 applied


digital
 continues
 to
 surge
 higher
 39.26.


They
 have
 a
 big
 deal
 with
 Core
 Wee.
 Had


a
 great
 earnings.
 That
 stock
 making
 a


move.
 SoFi
 15
 cents
 away
 from
 going
 back


to
 29.


Ethereum's
 down.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 a
 Fed


president
 on
 CNBC.
 Okay,
 let's
 He
 might


be
 saying
 some
 things
 that
 are
 good.


Remember
 Moran,
 Stephen
 Moran,
 he's
 a


dove.
 So,
 whatever
 he's
 saying
 is


probably
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 we're


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love
 right
 here


in
 the
 markets.
 quickly
 we
 get
 to


neutral,
 right?
 And
 so
 I
 wanted
 to
 get


to
 neutral
 relatively
 quickly.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 other
 people
 have
 us
 getting
 to


neutral
 also,
 but
 just
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 more
 slowly.
 And
 part
 of
 that


difference,
 right,
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 I


want
 to
 get
 there
 more
 quickly
 than


others
 is
 because
 I'm
 less
 con
 I'm
 less


concerned
 about
 upside
 inflation
 in
 the


near
 future,
 which
 then
 gives
 us
 the


flexibility
 and
 the
 freedom
 to
 get


there,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 more
 quickly.


What
 is
 neutral
 and
 and
 how
 do
 you
 know


what
 that
 level
 should
 be?


Yeah.
 So
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 a


great
 question.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to


acknowledge
 that
 these
 mod
 so
 you
 can't


observe
 neutral,
 right?
 The
 neutral


policy
 rate
 is
 the
 rate
 at
 which


monetary
 policy
 is
 neither
 restrictive


nor
 accommodary.
 It's
 uh
 you're
 not
 on


the
 you're
 not
 slamming
 the
 gas,
 you're


not
 slamming
 the
 brakes.
 You're
 sort
 of


just
 coasting
 along.
 And
 if
 you're
 below


neutral,
 you're
 stimulating
 the
 economy.


If
 you're
 above
 neutral,
 you're


restricting
 the
 economy,
 you're
 holding


it
 back.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for


us
 to
 understand
 that
 the
 models
 that


estimate
 neutral
 tend
 to
 give
 us
 wide


confidence
 bands.


So
 there
 is
 some
 difficulty
 in
 knowing


exactly
 where
 neutral
 is
 at
 any
 moment


in
 time.
 However,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little


bit
 easier
 to
 think
 about
 arguing
 from


arguing
 from
 changes
 to
 neutral.
 And


bro,
 he's
 using
 a
 lot
 of
 academic
 mumbo


jumbo.
 Basically,
 he's
 saying
 he's


cutting
 rates.
 I
 mean,
 goodness


gracious,
 the
 amount
 of


intellectualizing
 this
 guy
 is
 doing.


He's
 basically
 saying,
 "We
 need
 to
 cut


rates,
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 markets
 are


getting
 some
 love
 right
 here."
 Look
 at


the
 S&P
 on
 its
 way
 to
 669.
 IWM
 small


caps
 hitting
 all-time
 highs.
 Look
 at


that.
 252


on
 the
 small
 caps.
 That
 is
 green.
 Yeah.


Basically,
 what
 he's
 saying
 can
 be


summed
 up
 in
 one
 word.
 Calls.


Calls.
 That's
 what
 he's
 saying.
 SoFi


right
 there
 below
 29
 just
 below
 5
 cents


away.
 Google
 almost
 back
 to
 250.
 Haven't


seen
 250
 in
 like
 two
 weeks.
 Google


trying
 to
 get
 back
 up
 there.
 Pounder


1.62%.
 Hoodie
 2.2.
 Nvidia
 1.8.
 And
 then


Tesla


trying
 to
 break
 back
 to
 435.
 Now


Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin
 not
 really
 making


that
 big
 of
 a
 move
 with
 it.
 So
 those
 are


lagging
 a
 bit.
 BMR
 right
 here
 at
 5345.


That's
 still
 up
 1%.


But
 you
 got
 enough
 of
 Moran's
 comments


to
 resonate
 with
 the
 market
 right
 here.


SMCI
 up
 2.4.
 There
 you
 go.
 S&P
 up
 1%
 of


the
 day.
 Wow.
 Was
 down
 3%
 on
 Friday,


recovered
 1.5%
 on
 Monday,
 went
 down
 1.5%


on
 Tuesday,
 recovered
 1.2
 of
 that
 1.5%


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 It
 would
 have


been
 the
 entire
 1.5%
 without
 the


soybeans
 tweet.
 And
 now
 is
 back
 up
 1%.


I
 mean,
 the
 Bulls
 are
 in
 control
 right


here.
 Right
 now,
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 bulls


have
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 control


as
 they
 continue
 to
 run
 up
 on
 some
 of


this
 momentum.
 Apple,
 by
 the
 way,
 they


announced
 a
 bunch
 of
 new
 things
 with
 the


M5
 chip
 for
 the
 iPad
 and
 the
 MacBook


Pro.
 That
 that's
 why
 that's
 going
 green.


251.


You're
 seeing
 some
 of
 that
 excitement


there.


Uh,
 Bassen
 says,
 "We
 are
 in
 the
 third


inning
 of
 a
 tech
 investment
 boom.
 Good


chance
 we
 see
 1990s
 like
 productivity


miracle.
 Employment
 boom
 always
 follows


a
 capital
 spending
 boom."
 That
 comment


also
 is
 probably
 outweighing
 his
 China


comments
 because
 the
 market's
 like,
 "All


right,
 whatever
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 with


China
 is
 temporary.
 There
 will
 be
 a


conclusion
 to
 these
 soybeans
 and
 cooking


oil
 issues.
 But
 what
 is
 structural


is
 a
 productivity
 enhancement


potentially
 like
 we
 haven't
 seen
 in
 over


30
 years.
 And
 that
 likely
 means
 you
 end


up
 buying
 stocks."
 Now,
 what
 did
 JPAL


say
 yesterday?
 Because
 JPAL
 said
 some


things
 that
 were
 pretty
 damn
 bullish.


I'm
 going
 to
 play
 the
 clip
 right
 here.


But
 essentially,
 he
 is
 ready
 to


basically
 get
 back
 to
 quantitative


easing.


This
 framework
 has
 proved
 resilient


whether
 the
 balance
 sheet
 is
 shrinking


or
 growing.
 Since
 June
 2022,
 we've


reduced
 the
 size
 of
 our
 balance
 sheet
 by


2.2
 trillion
 from
 35%
 to
 just
 under
 22%


of
 GDP
 while
 maintaining
 effective


interest
 rate
 control.
 Our
 long-stated


plan
 is
 to
 stop
 balance
 sheet
 runoff


when
 reserves
 are
 somewhat
 above
 the


level
 we
 judge
 consistent
 with
 ample


reserves
 conditions.


We
 may
 approach
 that
 point
 in
 coming


months
 and
 we
 are
 closely
 monitoring
 a


wide
 range
 of
 indicators
 to
 inform
 this


decision.
 So,


so
 his
 plan
 is
 to
 stop
 the
 runoff
 off


the
 balance
 sheet
 aka
 quantitative


tightening.
 Stop
 selling
 off
 assets
 on


the
 balance
 sheet.
 uh
 that
 doesn't
 mean


they're
 buying
 assets
 yet,
 which
 would


be
 quantitative
 easing,
 but
 it


definitely
 means
 they're
 getting
 closer


to
 stopping
 quantitative
 tending.
 And


then
 the
 last
 sentence
 he
 says
 is
 in
 the


next
 few
 months
 that
 when
 he
 said
 next


few
 months,
 you
 know,
 we're
 talking


about
 alos
 and
 how
 they
 react
 to
 certain


words
 like
 China,
 soybeans,
 etc.


Yesterday,
 I
 think
 this
 was
 around
 2:30


p.m.
 you
 had
 a
 spike
 across
 the
 board.


You
 had
 a
 spike
 across
 the
 market
 when


the
 ALOS
 heard
 in
 the
 next
 few
 months


you
 might
 stop
 quantitative
 tightening.


And
 that
 quite
 frankly
 feels
 a
 lot
 more


bullish
 than
 any
 of
 the
 China
 narratives


because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 if
 you


have
 rates
 coming
 down
 and
 you
 have
 less


quantitative
 tightening
 and
 potentially


you
 get
 into
 quantitative
 easing
 assets


go
 up.
 Could
 that
 create
 an
 asset


bubble?
 Probably.
 And
 we'll
 deal
 with


that
 when
 we
 get
 there.
 But
 in
 the
 short


term,
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to
 be
 leveraged


long
 or
 at least
 net
 long
 in
 a
 situation


like
 that
 because
 you're
 probably
 going


to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 come
 off
 the


sidelines
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot


more
 liquidity
 in
 the
 system.
 Look
 at


the
 S&P
 50
 cents
 away
 from
 breaking
 670.


50
 cents
 away
 from

 Tesla


right
 there

 SoFi,
 are
 we
 above

 We
 are
 at

 Trying
 to
 break


through
 above
 that
 29.
 Google
 right
 here


trying
 to
 finally
 break
 above
 250.
 It's


been
 a
 minute
 since
 we
 got
 back
 up


there.
 It
 is
 trying.
 AMX,
 I
 do
 not
 know


about
 this
 stock.
 Ampress
 Technologies,


that's
 up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.

 so


batteries
 in
 general
 that's
 uh
 your


narrative
 battery
 and
 um
 energy
 and
 then


lithium
 we
 saw
 what
 happened
 with
 LAC
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 that
 stock
 right


they're
 up
 20.4%
 4%.
 They
 had
 to
 get


some
 type
 of
 deal
 this
 morning
 that's


getting
 the
 street
 excited.
 I
 don't


think
 they
 were
 up
 like
 that
 in
 the


pre-market.


So,
 whatever
 deal
 they
 got
 today.
 Oh,


looks
 like
 they
 partnered
 with
 an
 EVA


company.
 Yeah,
 this
 morning
 they
 got


they
 got
 partnered
 it
 looks
 like
 with
 an


Evo
 company
 and
 that's
 what's
 getting


this
 stock
 to
 get
 some
 momentum.
 There


you
 go.
 20%
 on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 those
 in


the
 energy
 space,
 if
 they're
 getting
 any


level
 of
 deal
 flow,
 they
 are
 getting
 a


move.
 ELF
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 3%.


Apple's
 up
 1.2.
 SMCI
 is
 up
 2.7.
 Amazon


continues
 to
 be
 a
 dud.
 Amazon
 continues


to
 be
 flat.
 217.
 Again,
 I
 think
 the


catalyst
 for
 Amazon
 is
 earnings,
 but
 you


know,
 to
 me,
 if
 it's
 a
 dud,
 it's
 safe


and
 you're
 probably
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 an
 opportunity
 right
 here.
 But


nonetheless,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 move
 like


an
 Oaklow.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 move
 like


an
 archer.
 If
 you're
 getting
 into
 Amazon


expecting
 those
 moves,
 you're
 going
 to


be
 sorely
 disappointed.
 If
 you're


getting
 into
 Amazon
 for
 a
 long-term,
 you


know,
 5
 10
 year
 compounder,
 that's


different.
 But
 Amazon
 basically
 flat
 on


the
 day
 21720.


S&P
 3
 cents
 away
 from
 670.
 Look
 at
 that.


3
 cents
 away.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 get
 there.


669.996.


Are
 we
 going
 to
 get
 there?
 There
 we
 go.


670.
 Wow.


673
 to
 647.
 Back
 to
 670
 in
 5
 days.


Back
 to
 670
 in
 5
 days.
 And
 then
 so
 back


above
 29
 2904


all
 on
 the
 day.


Look,
 not
 bad.
 Not
 bad.
 Bulls
 are


continuing
 to
 control
 some
 of
 this


momentum
 right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 if


you
 were
 a
 bear
 on
 Friday,
 the
 China


stuff
 has
 just
 not
 been
 enough
 to
 get


super
 upset.
 And
 then
 JPAL
 saying
 he's


going
 to
 stop
 quantitative
 tightening


with
 with
 Moran
 basically
 confirming


that
 rates
 are going
 to
 come
 down.
 Let's


get
 back
 to
 him.
 But
 it
 is
 really
 hard


to
 get
 that
 bearish
 when
 they're


basically
 telling
 you
 exactly
 what


they're
 going
 to
 do.


And
 so
 to
 me,
 while
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 be
 humble
 about
 knowing


exactly
 where
 neutral
 is
 at
 any
 moment


in
 time,
 I
 think
 it's
 easier
 to
 say
 that


we
 know
 some
 of
 the
 drivers
 of
 neutral


and
 we
 can
 sort
 of
 observe
 what
 happened


to
 those
 drivers.


You
 said
 that
 we're
 that
 you
 are
 still


very
 restrictive
 on
 rates,
 which
 is
 also


kind
 of
 a
 a
 point
 for
 debate
 because
 the


economy
 is
 doing
 very
 well.


So
 where
 do
 you
 see
 it
 being
 very


restrictive?
 Well,
 the
 economy
 was


weaker
 in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 year


versus
 where
 it
 had
 been
 last
 year.


That
 was
 trade,
 wasn't
 it?
 Imports
 and


exports,
 stocking
 up
 before
 the
 tariffs.


Uh,
 well,
 it
 was
 potentially
 related
 to


trade.
 It
 was
 related
 it
 was
 related
 to


to
 trade
 to
 to
 some
 front
 running
 of


tariffs.
 It
 was
 related
 to
 some
 uh


uncertainty
 around
 around
 trade
 and


taxes
 I
 mentioned
 before.
 Um
 but
 I
 do


think
 other
 elements
 of
 core
 underlying


domestic
 demand
 were
 weaker
 in
 the
 first


half
 of
 the
 year
 than
 they
 had
 been
 than


they
 had
 been
 than
 they
 had
 been
 in
 last


year.
 Uh
 thus
 far
 for
 the
 third
 quarter


you
 know
 we
 have
 very
 little
 data
 uh
 to


give
 us
 indications
 for
 the
 third


quarter.
 Um
 but
 I
 also
 think
 that
 the


labor
 market
 has
 clearly
 has
 clearly


weakened
 uh
 somewhat
 over
 the
 course
 of


the
 year
 and
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 has


ticked
 up
 um
 has
 has
 been
 moving
 up


gradually
 in
 in
 in
 the
 recent
 past.
 So,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 And
 then
 you
 sort
 of


look
 at
 something
 like
 the
 housing


market,
 right?
 And
 and and
 housing
 is
 is


is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest,
 if
 not
 the
 the


biggest
 transmission
 channel
 from
 of


monetary
 policy
 into
 the
 real
 economy.


And
 that
 has
 been,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


rather
 rather
 morbunded
 for
 for
 a
 while


now


on
 high
 on
 high
 rates,
 mortgage
 rates,


uh
 largely
 on
 high
 rates.
 Yeah.


But
 if
 the
 Fed
 lowers
 rates,
 it's
 not


guaranteed
 that
 mortgage
 rates
 will
 come


down.
 We
 didn't
 see
 that
 last
 year.


So,
 that's
 a
 great
 that's
 a
 great
 point.


Um,
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 last
 year,
 uh,
 I


thought
 that
 cutting
 was
 the
 wrong
 move,


right?
 And
 it's
 related
 to
 this
 neutral


rate
 conversation
 we
 were
 just
 having.


So,
 I
 thought
 last
 year
 the
 neutral
 rate


was
 much
 higher
 due
 to
 a
 variety
 of


factors
 including
 things
 like
 population


growth
 being
 higher,
 including
 things


like
 deficits
 being
 wider,
 um, that


raised
 the
 neutral
 rate.
 Um,
 which
 means


that
 if
 neutral
 was
 here,
 so
 if
 you
 keep


policy
 here
 and
 neutral's
 up
 here,
 then


I
 think
 that
 policy
 is
 not
 very


restrictive.
 And
 so,
 I
 thought
 that


cutting
 last
 year
 wasn't
 necessarily
 the


right
 move.
 If
 neutral
 has
 come
 down
 and


you
 keep
 policy
 here
 then
 the
 different


the
 the
 distance
 between
 them
 has
 grown


and
 so
 therefore
 policy
 became
 more


restrictive
 even
 though
 you
 kept
 the


nominal
 rate
 relatively
 similar
 and
 so


that
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 is
 reasons
 for


cutting
 and
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 thought
 last


year
 it
 was
 a
 mistake
 to
 cut
 and
 this


year
 it's
 the
 right
 move
 to
 cut


and
 the
 market
 told
 you
 that
 and
 you


think
 this
 year
 market
 will
 go
 along


exactly
 so
 in
 the
 I
 think
 eight
 18


trading
 sessions
 since
 we
 cut
 rates
 so


in
 September


uh
 long
 yields
 are
 I
 think
 like
 four
 or


five
 basis
 points
 down.


All
 right.
 So
 again,
 this
 guy's
 uh
 he


definitely
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 words
 to
 kind


of
 make
 the
 overall
 point,
 but
 at
 its


core,
 he's
 saying
 we
 need
 to
 cut
 rates.


I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 we
 get
 from
 that.


And
 I
 don't
 think
 JPL
 disagrees
 with


him.
 I
 don't
 think
 Michelle
 Bowman


yesterday,
 who
 reaffirmed
 her
 target
 for


two
 more
 rate
 cuts
 by
 the
 end
 of the


year,
 disagrees.
 I
 don't
 think


Christopher
 Waller,
 who
 this
 morning


said,
 "Hey,
 the
 labor
 market's
 getting
 a


little
 iffy."
 And
 you
 know,
 he's
 been


saying
 that
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 months.


You've
 got
 plenty
 of
 doves
 on
 the
 Fed.


The
 question
 is
 how
 uh
 much
 is
 the
 cycle


going
 to
 continue.
 Uh
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones


yesterday
 said
 that
 the
 neutral
 rate


might
 be
 two
 and
 a
 half%.
 By
 the
 end
 of


next
 year,
 which
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 I


mean,
 we're
 not
 at
 2021
 levels
 in
 terms


of
 the
 the
 the
 rates,
 you
 know,
 that
 at


2021
 it
 was
 basically
 at
 zero,
 but
 we


are
 getting
 pretty
 close.
 We
 are
 getting


dramatically
 closer
 than
 where
 we
 were


in
 2022.
 And
 you
 would
 imagine
 that
 risk


on
 assets
 would
 catch
 a
 bid.
 Right?


Right
 there.
 That's
 up
 2.2%.
 Amazon
 216,


Meta
 that's
 up
 1.9,
 AL
 2.2.
 And
 the


ironic
 thing
 is
 the
 fear
 is
 like,
 okay,


let's
 say
 rates
 go
 down
 to
 two
 and a


half
 percent.
 26


um
 and
 you
 have
 a
 massive
 inflation


bubble,
 right?
 You
 just
 have
 an
 acid


bubble
 and
 then
 inflation,
 you
 know,


ramps
 up
 like
 crazy
 because
 rates
 are
 so


low.
 What
 if
 AI
 ends
 up
 becoming


extremely
 deflationary?


Not
 only
 because
 the
 labor
 market


weakens
 because
 AI
 commoditizes
 jobs,


but
 sort
 of
 Elon's
 vision,
 which
 is
 that


the
 cost
 of
 goods
 dramatically
 decreases


and
 there's
 this
 kind
 of
 age
 of


abundance
 that
 everyone
 can
 afford


everything
 because
 things
 go
 down
 so


much
 because
 of
 the
 enhanced


productivity.
 I
 mean,
 that
 might
 put
 to


rest
 the
 concerns
 of
 low
 interest
 rates


would
 cause
 massive
 inflation.
 And
 so,


you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 tailwinds


that
 are
 intersecting
 with
 each
 other,


but
 I
 think
 the
 solution
 ends
 up
 being


net
 long
 something
 other
 than
 cash.
 And


that's
 probably
 why
 gold
 is
 hitting
 that


4200
 level.
 Silver
 at
 5270


as
 we
 continue
 to
 see
 that
 cash
 might


not
 be
 the
 best
 spot
 to
 be
 in.
 Um,


so
 there
 you
 go.
 You
 got
 some
 green


right
 there
 across
 the
 board
 based
 on


those
 comments.
 Google,
 are
 we
 back
 to


250?
 Google,
 very
 close.
 249.85.
 It


touched
 it
 today.
 24950.
 Grab
 at
 609.


Reddit
 at
 292.
 Rocket
 Lab
 still
 holding


7250.


That
 is
 also
 green.
 Archer
 again
 based


on
 the
 acquisition
 of
 those
 Lilium
 uh


assets.
 Looks
 like
 Archer
 is
 getting
 a


bid
 right
 there.
 That's
 up
 7.3%.
 Hims,


where
 is
 Hims
 today?
 Is
 that
 at
 57?


That's
 at
 56.81


just
 below
 57.
 Irene,
 are
 we
 at
 75?
 IN


is
 at
 73.
 got
 to
 75
 in
 the
 pre-markets


right
 now
 at
 73.


Amcor
 is
 running
 a
 little
 bit.
 Yeah,
 you


got
 Amcore
 at
 30.82.


It's
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love
 again.


Amcore
 to
 me.
 Oh,
 one
 thing
 I
 found
 out


about
 Amcore
 yesterday.
 This
 is
 uh
 I
 was


texting
 with
 Stock
 Talk
 and
 he
 told
 me


this.
 Um


Amcor
 won
 the
 best
 supplier
 award
 from


Broadcom
 back
 in
 2024.


So,
 you
 know,
 when
 we're
 talking
 about
 a


semiconductor
 packaging
 company
 that


trades
 at
 a
 very
 reasonable
 multiple
 on


a
 price
 of
 sales
 on
 a
 PE
 basis
 and
 that


is
 undergoing
 a
 rerating
 if
 they
 can


reshore
 manufacturing
 in
 the


semiconductor
 fabs
 in
 the
 United
 States,


which
 is
 what
 Trump
 is
 focused
 on,


Jensen
 is
 focused
 on,
 Tim
 Cook
 is


focused
 on.
 um
 and
 working
 closely
 with


TSM.
 It's
 just
 another
 point
 of
 due


diligence
 on
 this
 is
 probably
 one
 of
 the


more
 legit
 American
 companies
 working


specifically
 on
 semiconductor


manufacturing
 or
 packaging.


And
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 I
 think
 at
 these


multiples
 it's
 pretty
 cheap
 and
 it's


only
 up
 17%
 this
 year
 but
 they're
 going


to
 need
 a
 good
 earnings
 to
 kind
 of


rerate
 and
 it
 might
 take
 a
 couple


earnings
 to
 get
 there.
 It's
 just
 if
 you


believe
 in
 all
 this
 AI
 capex
 demand,
 the


question
 is
 where
 is
 it
 going?
 And
 if


TSM
 is
 any
 indicator
 of
 how
 much
 demand


there
 is,
 I
 think
 AMC
 probably
 is
 a


beneficiary.
 TMT
 right
 there,
 that's
 up


2.6%


on
 the
 day.
 BMR,
 are
 we
 still
 above
 53


5370?


So,
 all
 right.
 So,
 let's
 do
 a
 sentiment


check
 on
 BMR
 because
 I
 think
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks,
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 this
 one.
 Uh,
 I
 know
 that
 I
 guess


a
 week
 ago
 I
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 more


bearish
 and
 I
 went
 on
 that
 rant
 about
 I


see
 all
 these
 Twitter
 targets
 calling


for
 100
 150
 and
 I
 think it's
 all
 BS


because
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


Ethereum
 has
 to
 make
 a
 move
 to
 get
 there


and
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 if
 Ethereum


makes
 that
 10
 $15,000
 move
 that
 people


are
 thinking
 about.
 But
 does
 Ethereum


stay
 flat
 at
 4,000
 and
 Bitine
 stays
 flat


in
 the
 55
 to
 60
 range
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year?
 Like
 is
 it
 one
 or
 the
 other?


Is
 it
 150
 or
 is
 it
 50
 or
 are
 we


somewhere
 in
 the
 middle?
 So,
 I
 mean,


what
 what
 are
 people
 thinking?
 Do
 we


still
 think
 BMR
 can
 make
 that
 massive


move
 that
 people
 were
 calling
 for
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 or
 is
 this
 one
 where


covered
 calls
 are
 going
 to
 print
 and


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 of


money
 from
 those
 option
 buyers
 that


think
 it's
 going to
 get
 to
 some


egregious
 level
 and
 it
 ends
 up
 just
 not


happening?


Let's
 do
 a
 poll
 right
 there.
 BMR


100
 end
 of
 year,
 150
 end
 of
 year,


50
 end
 of
 year,
 which
 is
 more
 bearish,


right?
 It
 stays
 flat.
 And
 then
 75,
 which


is
 bullish
 but
 not
 super
 bullish.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 If
 I
 had
 to
 guess,
 I


would
 go
 with
 75.
 I
 would
 go
 with
 and


that
 that's
 that's
 being
 optimistic
 that


ETH
 makes
 a
 move.
 If
 it
 doesn't
 or
 if
 it


just
 stays
 flat,
 that's
 not
 bearish


Ethereum.
 It's
 just,
 hey,
 ETH's
 not


making
 that
 crazy
 of
 a
 move.
 And
 you


know,
 if
 you're
 bullish
 tokenization
 of


stable
 coins
 long
 term,
 that
 move
 will


inevitably
 happen.
 But
 it
 might
 not


happen
 in
 the
 next
 two
 months.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 not
 crazy
 to
 imagine.
 Now


granted,
 you
 got
 rate
 cuts
 coming
 up


which
 is
 going
 to
 help,
 but
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 ETH
 can
 make
 that


move.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 112.


Bitcoin
 right
 there
 112.
 Yeah,
 it's


almost
 November.
 I
 mean,
 well,
 this
 is


also
 what
 is
 confusing
 to
 me
 about
 Tom


and
 I
 love
 Tom
 Lee.
 He's,
 you
 know,
 he's


a
 friend
 of
 the
 channel,
 but
 his
 price


target
 on
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum,
 I
 I
 I


it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 it
 happening.


200
 to
 250
 on
 Bitcoin
 and
 then
 Ethereum


10
 to
 12.
 Look,
 you
 have
 to
 have
 some


pretty
 aggressive
 price
 targets
 when


you're
 out
 there
 on
 an
 island
 making


your
 predictions.
 Um,
 and
 he's
 done
 that


successfully
 for
 the
 past
 10
 years,


right?
 But
 like
 in
 two
 months
 to
 have


Bitcoin
 make
 that
 much
 of
 a
 move
 or


Ethereum's
 make
 that
 much
 of a
 move,
 I


don't
 know,
 bro.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 aggressive.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 a
 bit
 aggressive.
 And


if
 you've
 got
 those
 60
 covered
 calls,


65,
 I
 mean,
 hell,
 even
 if
 you
 have
 like


57
 58s
 every
 week,
 they're
 printing.
 or


I
 mean
 BMR
 is
 just
 a
 moneymaker
 on


covered
 calls
 right
 now
 which
 could


change
 but
 it
 is
 printing
 app
 right


there
 2.8%
 8%
 applo
 and
 back
 above
 600.


Even
 Arthur
 Hayes
 who's
 another
 crypto


OG
 he
 was
 on
 a
 podcast
 with
 Tom
 Lee
 two


days
 ago
 and
 here's
 what
 he
 said
 about


this
 cycle
 for
 crypto.


This
 cycle
 is
 different
 than
 the
 la
 the


last
 three.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 take
 a
 look


at
 Chinese
 credit
 and
 US
 credit
 which


leads
 me
 to
 say
 there
 is
 no
 four-year


cycle
 at least
 right
 now
 and
 so
 we
 are


in
 sort
 of
 a
 extended
 cycle
 whatever
 you


want
 to
 call
 it
 new
 world
 order
 change


in
 you
 know
 trade
 situation
 whatever


right
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 am
 of
 the
 opinion
 that


this
 cycle
 ends
 when
 the
 Trump


administration
 ends
 because
 it'll
 be
 a


reaction
 against
 Trump
 whether
 you
 like


it
 or
 not
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 and
 you


know
 that's
 a
 2028
 8
 late
 2027
 story


when
 the
 rhetoric
 of
 the
 opposing
 team


blue
 democrats
 starts
 to
 cause
 questions


in
 investors
 minds.
 Oh,
 what
 if
 they
 win


and
 therefore
 what
 if
 things
 change?


Therefore,
 I
 maybe
 should
 I
 should
 take


some
 chip
 off
 the
 table.


So
 Arthur
 Hayes,
 he
 also
 agrees
 Bitcoin


200
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 But
 his


argument
 is
 this
 cycle
 that


theoretically
 is
 supposed
 to
 have
 a


winter
 in
 2026,
 right?
 Like
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 historical
 cycles,
 that's
 the


four
 year
 2026
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 a


winter.
 His
 argument
 is
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 the
 level
 of
 uh


optimism
 essentially
 they
 have
 around


crypto
 is
 not
 going
 to
 let
 this
 thing


end
 easily
 next
 year.
 S&P
 is
 still


holding
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Now
 2028
 it's
 a


question
 on
 you
 know
 if
 Democrats
 win
 or


Republicans
 win
 who's
 more
 supportive
 of


crypto.
 One
 could
 argue
 the
 Democrats


are
 going to
 have
 to
 become
 supportive


of
 crypto
 because
 they're
 going
 to


alienate
 too
 many
 people
 if
 they
 launch


a
 presidential
 campaign
 that
 is
 not


supportive
 of
 crypto.
 But
 the
 broader


argument
 is
 Trump
 is
 bullish
 for
 crypto.


Tesla
 right
 there
 437.
 That
 one
 also


continuing
 to
 go
 greed.
 Where
 is
 uh
 fear


and
 greed?
 Let's
 see.


We
 are
 at
 36.
 We
 were
 at
 29
 yesterday,


folks.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 pretty
 big


move.
 Still
 in
 fear.
 Not
 in
 neutral
 yet.


I
 guess
 neutral
 probably
 gets
 you
 to
 637


or
 675ish
 on
 the
 S&P.


We
 were
 barely
 in
 neutral
 last
 week
 at


alltime
 highs.
 Tesla
 at
 437
 making
 a


little
 bit
 of
 move.
 By
 the
 way,
 Google,


back
 to
 250.


Back
 to
 250
 on
 the
 Googles.
 It
 has
 been


about
 a
 week
 since
 we
 were
 there.
 And


before
 that,
 it
 has
 been
 Yeah,
 basically


two
 and
 a
 half
 weeks.
 September
 29th
 was


when
 it
 was
 really
 holding
 250.
 So,
 gave


you
 a
 dip
 at
 232,
 right
 back
 to
 250.5


on
 Google.
 Yeah,
 we're
 not
 even
 in


neutral.
 We
 are
 still
 in
 fear.


We
 are
 still
 inferior.
 Yes,
 Arthur
 had


the
 same
 price
 targets
 as
 Tom
 Lee.
 And


look,
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for
 Arthur


Hayes.
 He's
 a
 massive
 crypto
 OG.
 I'm


just
 thinking,
 dude,
 we
 have
 two
 months


left.
 They're
 calling
 for
 Bitcoin
 to
 go


from
 110
 to
 200.


Dude,
 if
 that
 happens,
 Robin
 Hood's


going
 to
 go
 to
 $200
 a
 [ __ ]
 If
 that


Coinbase
 is
 going
 to
 be
 500,
 but
 like
 if


that
 I
 the
 magnitude
 of
 that
 move
 and


the
 derivative
 impact
 it
 will
 have
 on
 a


micro
 strategy,
 which
 is
 probably
 going


to
 break
 all-time
 highs
 in
 the
 500s
 if


Bitcoin
 gets
 there.


I
 just
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 have
 that


big
 of
 a
 move
 because
 the
 implications


of
 that
 big
 of
 a
 move
 on
 the
 equity


markets
 is
 gigantic.


But
 if
 it
 happens,
 I
 wouldn't
 complain.


It's
 just
 like
 it's
 it's
 pretty


incredible
 to
 imagine
 that
 actually


taking
 place.
 Core
 right
 there
 140,


Coinbase
 up
 1.3
 and
 then
 Rocket
 Lab


that's
 up
 6.1%.
 What
 did
 you
 guys
 say
 in


the
 poll?
 Let's
 see
 right
 here.
 50%
 of


you
 say
 75
 end
 of
 year.


Okay,
 that's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 sentiment


shift
 from
 two
 weeks
 ago
 where
 most


people
 were
 calling
 for
 100
 or
 at least


like
 85
 to
 100
 was
 the
 target.


So,
 you
 do
 have
 some
 people
 kind
 of


saying,
 "All
 right,
 maybe
 it's
 not


really
 going
 to
 make
 as
 big
 of
 a
 move
 as


we
 thought.


by
 the
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Serve


Robotics
 is
 that
 moving
 that
 one
 made
 a


good
 move
 last
 week.
 Um
 and
 was
 getting


some
 love.
 Roblox
 right
 there
 1797.


That
 continues
 to
 go
 green


on
 the
 day.
 You
 got
 server.
 Wow.
 Serves


of
 10%


on
 the
 day.
 10.24


is
 green
 for
 serve
 robotics.


Um,


let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 more
 comments


from
 Greer
 and
 Bent
 on
 this
 China
 stuff


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there


to
 get
 the
 flow
 of
 magnets
 to
 something


that
 was
 barely
 tolerable.
 Right
 now


take
 that
 program
 which
 was
 trying
 to


deal
 with
 thousands
 of
 license


applications
 and
 multiply
 it
 by
 a


thousand.
 That's
 what
 we're
 talking


about
 because
 we're
 not
 just
 talking


about
 the
 rare
 earths
 themselves.
 We're


talking
 about
 many
 downstream
 products


that
 contain
 those
 rare
 earths.


remember.1%


if.1%
 of
 a
 product
 has
 a
 Chinese
 rare


earth
 in
 it,
 it
 could
 be
 controlled
 by


this
 and
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 scape
 the
 scope


and
 the
 scale
 is
 just
 uh
 unimaginable


and
 it
 cannot
 be
 implemented.


And
 to
 follow
 up
 on
 that
 uh
 right
 now
 we


are
 currently
 in
 a
 90day
 role


on
 the
 tariffs.
 So,
 is
 it
 possible
 that


we
 could
 go
 to
 a
 longer
 role
 uh
 in


return
 for
 a
 delay?
 Perhaps.
 But,
 you


know,
 all
 all
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 uh


negotiated
 in
 the
 coming
 weeks
 before


the
 before
 the
 leaders
 meet
 in
 Korea.


Thank
 you
 everybody.
 With
 apologies


again.
 They
 do
 have
 to
 get
 to
 another.


Okay.
 So,
 Bent
 is
 confirming
 that
 there


will
 be
 a
 meeting
 in
 Korea,
 which
 is


good.
 S&P
 still
 up
 1.15.
 Bitcoin
 is


lagging
 on
 the
 day.
 Bitcoin
 barely
 above


112,
 but
 um
 also
 the
 confirmation
 of
 the


meeting
 in
 Korea
 likely
 is
 why
 the
 the


soybean
 stuff
 might
 not
 be
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal


and
 maybe
 the
 markets


are
 more
 excited
 about
 that.


um


NPhphase.
 Okay.
 So,
 again,
 we
 don't
 have


an
 administration
 that
 supports
 solar,


but
 you
 do
 have
 NPhase
 that
 is
 still
 a


pretty
 strong
 solar
 company.
 They
 just


don't
 have
 the
 subsidies
 they
 had
 back


in
 22.
 Uh
 not
 sure
 why
 they're
 up
 8%
 on


the
 day.
 There
 might
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a


headline,
 but
 you
 know,
 it
 would
 not


surprise
 me
 if
 the
 solar
 names
 catch
 a


bid
 just
 on
 the
 sheer
 demand
 for
 energy


at
 large.
 The
 problem
 is,
 you
 know,
 if


they
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 support
 from


a
 regulatory
 perspective,
 it
 might
 not


be
 that
 easy
 for
 them
 to
 capitalize
 on


the
 demand,
 but
 data
 centers
 need
 a
 lot


of
 power
 and
 solar
 is
 not
 a
 crazy
 story


to
 imagine
 that
 power.
 Jeff
 did
 upgrade


Enface
 to
 41.


So,
 that
 could
 also
 be
 helping


in
 this
 uh
 in
 this
 move
 right
 here.


Yeah,
 solar
 obviously
 still
 is
 a
 a


pretty
 important
 energy
 play.
 Uh
 where


is
 CLA
 today?
 This
 one's
 been
 a
 little


flat.
 CLA
 3875.
 Not
 a
 good
 IPO,
 folks.


Dude,
 we
 haven't
 had
 an
 IPO
 in
 a
 minute.


What
 happened?
 Feel
 like
 it's
 been
 a


month
 since
 we
 had
 an
 IPO,
 right?
 The


last
 IPO
 we
 had
 was
 Fermy,
 which
 that


stock
 is
 basically
 flat
 since
 IPO.
 It's


up
 a
 little
 bit.
 2.28%
 down
 today,


I
 guess
 towards
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 mean,


where's
 the
 Discord?
 Where's
 the
 uh
 the


stripes?
 Like
 we're
 still
 missing
 a
 lot


of
 those
 big
 companies


that
 have
 not
 gone
 public.
 Now,
 we
 have


had
 a
 lot.
 We've
 had
 like
 10x
 more


companies
 this
 year
 than
 2022.
 Google


251.


We
 are
 still
 missing
 some.
 Amazon
 still


flat
 on
 the
 day
 216


21689.
 Where
 is
 Figma?
 Is
 that
 moving
 a


bit?
 Figma,


that's

 Tesla
 making
 a
 move
 440.


We
 got
 earnings
 October
 22nd.


October
 22nd
 for
 Tessie.
 It'll
 be
 a


Wednesday
 after
 hours.
 We'll
 be
 live.
 I


think
 Steve
 will
 join
 me
 on
 that
 one
 and


uh
 we'll
 try
 to
 see
 what
 happens.
 Let's


take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 draft.
 Matt's


probably
 in
 first
 place
 still.
 Wow.


Matt's
 crossed
 50%.


He's
 up
 172
 on
 Rocket
 Lab
 and


131
 on
 AS.


I'm
 at
 42.
 Duolingo
 still
 in
 the
 uh
 in


the
 300s.
 Steve's
 up
 seven.
 Tanner's
 up


21.
 Chris
 is
 up
 13.
 Matt's
 up
 53.


By
 the
 way,
 Palunteer
 earnings
 is
 on


November
 3rd.
 Grab
 earnings
 is
 on


November
 3rd.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 be


streaming
 Palunteer
 earnings.
 I'm


probably
 not
 going
 to
 get
 to
 stream
 Grab


earnings,
 but
 I
 mean
 that
 November
 3rd


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 day
 because


I've
 got
 big
 positions
 of
 both


companies.
 will
 be
 live
 for
 pound
 tier


and
 then
 you
 know
 grab
 is
 later
 in
 the


night
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 those


numbers
 look
 like
 and
 then
 two
 days


later
 we
 have
 freaking
 hood
 on
 November


5th.


So
 that
 first
 week
 of
 November
 get
 ready


to
 strap
 in.
 It
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wild


wild
 week
 and
 SoFi
 is
 like
 five
 days


before
 that.
 October
 28th
 28.92
 on
 SoFi


that's
 up
 3.7%
 as
 well.


So
 I
 think
 him
 is
 on
 November
 3rd
 as


well.
 You
 got
 a
 ton
 of
 companies
 that


are
 SMCI's
 on
 the
 fourth.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


that
 first
 week
 of
 November,
 that
 first


freaking
 week
 of
 November
 is
 going
 to
 be


massive.
 You
 also
 have
 Na'vias,
 Tempest


on
 November
 3rd,
 Vertex.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


a
 ton
 of
 these
 companies.


So,
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 pretty


big
 day.
 The
 Tesla
 shareholder
 stuff.


Okay,
 so
 first
 of
 all,
 put
 in
 the
 chat


if
 you
 have
 voted
 your
 Tesla
 shares.
 I


still
 haven't
 done
 that
 yet
 because
 I'm


lazy,
 but
 I
 will
 do
 it.
 I
 think
 the


deadline
 is
 November
 6th.
 One
 thing
 that


was
 kind
 of
 interesting
 about
 that,


which
 I
 don't
 know,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you


think
 it's
 bullish
 or
 bearish,
 is


Tesla's
 advertising
 on
 Facebook
 to
 get


people
 to
 vote
 in
 the
 meeting.


And
 Tesla
 doesn't
 tend
 to
 even
 advertise


their
 cars
 as
 much.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that


they're
 advertising


on
 Facebook
 and
 Instagram
 to
 get
 Tesla


shareholders
 to
 make
 a
 vote,
 it's
 quite


incredible.
 And
 it
 it
 just
 it
 just
 goes


to
 show
 how
 serious
 this
 vote
 is
 and
 how


important
 uh
 Elon
 is,
 you
 know,
 thinking


of
 his
 compensation
 package
 and
 the


ability
 for
 Tesla
 to
 invest
 in
 XAI.
 I


mean,
 you
 have
 all
 those
 different


amends
 that
 really
 do
 matter.
 So,
 they


are
 advertising
 they
 want
 people
 to


vote.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think,
 yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 going to
 be
 a
 landslide.
 I
 think


last
 time
 it
 was
 7525
 for
 the


compensation
 pack.
 It was
 like
 73
 27


something
 like
 that,
 but
 it
 was


overwhelmingly
 in
 support.
 I
 can't


imagine
 it
 would
 be
 any
 different
 this


time.


You
 even
 had
 the
 nores
 bank
 voting


against
 his
 compensation
 package.
 It
 was


like
 500
 million
 shares
 or
 something


voted
 against
 it
 last
 time
 and
 that


still
 didn't
 even
 put
 a
 dent
 in
 the


amount
 of
 support
 that
 Elon
 got
 from


retail.


So
 yeah,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 your
 brokerage,


you
 you
 probably
 get
 an
 email
 from
 your


brokerage.
 They
 they
 give
 you


instructions
 on
 how
 to
 vote
 your
 shares,


but


you
 do
 have
 that
 as
 another
 tailwind
 for


Tesla
 as
 well.
 439


right
 here


on
 Tesla.


Na'vias,

Uh,


Amazon
 continues
 to
 get
 hit.
 I
 mean,


dude,
 I
 like
 this
 on
 Amazon.
 I
 really


do.
 It's
 It's
 not
 that
 upsetting
 to
 me.


I
 mean,
 if
 you
 think
 Amazon's
 cheap,


then
 this
 is
 your
 opportunity.
 This
 is


exactly
 what
 we
 saw
 with
 Google,
 and
 we


saw
 the
 move
 that
 Google
 had
 after
 that.


So
 you
 either
 believe
 in
 it
 or
 you


don't.
 But
 at
 its
 core
 also
 I
 mean


here's
 a
 interesting
 stat
 about
 Amazon.


Currently
 right
 now
 we
 haven't
 used
 that


in
 a
 minute.
 We
 got
 to
 get
 back
 to
 that.


Currently
 right
 now
 Amazon
 is
 trading
 at


its
 lowest
 EV
 to
 Ebida
 multiple
 in


history.
 It
 has
 never
 been
 cheaper
 than


right
 now
 on
 an
 EV
 to
 Ebida
 multiple


basis.
 This
 is
 similar
 to
 Google's


forward
 earnings
 being
 the
 lowest
 it
 was


at
 at
 150
 in
 its
 history.
 and
 you
 know


that
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 good
 opportunity.


So
 again,
 it's
 a
 high
 quality
 company


that
 you're
 getting
 at
 a
 cheaper
 price


than
 normal,
 but
 it's
 not
 going to
 be
 a


mover


like
 an
 Olo,
 which
 is
 still
 up
 about
 7%


on
 the
 day.


Yeah.
 And
 it's
 the
 most
 diversified
 it's


ever
 been.
 That's
 also
 true.


Would
 you
 say
 currently
 right
 now
 it's
 a


good
 time
 to
 buy?
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 buying.


So,
 also,
 yeah,
 they
 announced
 some


layoffs
 end
 of
 month.
 So,


I
 mean,
 look,
 the
 real
 thing
 about


Amazon
 here
 is
 like
 I'm
 not
 like
 going


super,
 oh
 my
 goodness,
 this
 is
 the
 next


big
 thing.
 This
 is
 like
 the
 this
 is
 I'm


not
 pounding
 the
 table
 on
 Amazon
 by
 any


means.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 in
 a
 market
 where


everything's
 running
 and
 obviously


people
 are
 getting
 worried
 about
 random


names
 going
 up
 20%
 in
 a
 day
 and
 I'm


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 messages
 every
 day
 of


just
 like
 the
 uneasiness
 of
 a
 feeling
 in


this
 market
 to
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 a
 mag


seven
 company
 that's
 trading
 at
 its


lowest
 multiple
 in
 history
 that
 has
 is


red
 year
 to
 date
 has
 not
 even
 moved


green
 positive
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 a


safer
 bet
 and
 you
 sacrifice
 the


risk-to-reward
 upside
 for
 safety


But
 you
 know
 in
 any
 portfolio
 that
 level


of
 safety
 in
 that
 high
 quality
 of
 a


company
 is
 is
 not
 a
 horrible
 thing.


Apple
 right
 there
 breaking
 above
 250
 as


well.
 251
 that's
 up
 1.3%


and
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Isn't


buying
 Amazon
 a
 value
 trap?
 I
 refuse
 to


believe
 yet
 Amazon
 is
 a
 value
 trap.


PayPal
 and
 Salesforce
 have
 turned
 out
 to


be
 massive
 value
 traps
 this
 year.
 I
 I


it's
 hard
 to
 say
 a
 company


doing
 the
 types
 of
 numbers
 Amazon
 is


doing
 is
 a
 value
 trap.
 The
 stock
 price


is
 a
 whole
 different
 question,
 but
 you


know,
 PayPal
 and
 Salesforce,
 I
 think,


are
 more
 in
 that
 category.
 Now,
 look,
 if


Amazon's
 flat
 all
 of
 2026,
 and
 I
 mean,


maybe
 you
 have
 an
 argument
 there.
 I
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 happen,
 but


I
 think
 you
 need
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time


before
 Amazon
 fully
 becomes
 a
 it's
 even


crazy
 for
 us
 to
 imagine
 amin


is
 a
 value
 trap.


And
 that's
 what
 they
 said
 about
 Google,


right?
 It's
 a
 value
 trap
 at
 150.
 It


turned
 out
 to
 be
 deep
 value.
 And
 maybe


that's
 the
 case
 with
 Amazon.


My
 average
 to
 Amazon
 is
 220.
 220
 is
 my


average
 on
 Amazon.
 Check
 sauna.


Sauna
 biotech
 is
 up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.
 Did


someone
 tweet
 about
 this?
 Is
 that
 why


it's
 moving?


It's
 a
 biotech.


Oh,
 boy.
 All right,
 folks.
 So
 you
 got


your
 next
 hund
 bagger
 by
 Mr.
 Eric


Jackson.
 There
 you
 go.


Eric
 Jackson
 sauna
 looks
 like
 the
 next


hund
 bagger.


Okay.
 So
 open
 was
 the
 first
 hundred


bagger.
 Better
 was
 the
 first
 or
 was
 the


second
 I
 think
 500
 bagger.
 He
 thinks


that's
 going to
 go
 to
 $12,000
 a
 share.


Yesterday
 Hutate
 Mining
 was
 the
 next


hundred
 bagger.
 He
 thinks
 that's
 going


to
 go
 to
 500
 billion
 in
 market
 cap.
 Now


he's
 saying
 SA
 is
 the
 next
 100
 bagger.


I
 have
 not
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 due
 diligence


on
 those
 companies,
 so
 I
 can't
 really


say
 if
 that
 could
 happen
 or
 not,
 but
 the


stock
 is
 pumping
 20%
 on
 a
 sauna
 biotech.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 likely
 because
 of
 Eric


Jackson.
 I
 mean,
 who
 else
 would
 get
 this


thing
 to
 move
 that
 much
 unless
 they
 had


drug
 results
 today,
 which
 I
 don't
 think


they
 did.


There
 you
 go.
 I
 would
 just
 say
 it's
 hard


to
 find
 hundred
 baggers.
 It's
 not
 easy.


And
 when
 you're
 throwing
 them
 out
 every


other
 day,


I
 mean,
 at
 this
 point,
 it's
 two
 for
 the


week.
 He
 found
 200
 baggers
 for
 for
 the


week.
 I
 mean,
 200
 baggers
 for
 the
 week.


I
 mean,


Stanley
 Ducken
 Ducken
 Miller,
 Warren


Buffett,
 the
 Lakman,
 they
 spend
 10
 years


trying
 to
 find
 a
 10
 bagger.
 So,
 finding


200
 baggers
 in
 two
 days.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


to
 give
 someone
 credit
 for
 being
 able
 to


find
 that.
 So,


there
 you
 go.
 But
 I
 I
 likely
 am
 not


going
 to
 be
 taking
 the
 risk
 on
 sauna.


But
 I'll
 look
 into
 it.
 In
 general,
 I


don't
 touch
 biotech.
 He
 is
 Eric
 Jackson.


Eric
 Jackson
 is
 right
 that
 XBI
 has
 been


depressed
 this
 whole
 year.
 The
 biotech


sector
 has
 been
 depressed.
 So
 I
 mean
 he


does
 have
 the
 trend
 in
 the
 right
 theme


that
 biotechs
 have
 not
 taken
 off.
 So


likely
 biotechs
 will
 have
 if
 we
 get
 a
 a


sort
 of
 broader
 diversified
 market
 room


to
 take
 off.
 Is
 sana
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hund


bagger
 in
 that
 space?
 I
 don't
 know.
 That


comes
 down
 to
 your
 due
 diligence.
 Look


at
 AMD
 though.
 235,


five
 bucks
 away
 from
 240.
 And
 then


Grabby
 Grab,
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right


here,
 4%,
 614
 on
 Grab,


went
 to
 589
 yesterday.
 So,
 nice
 little


move
 up
 higher
 on
 Grab.
 That's
 up
 3%.


SoFi's
 up
 3%.
 AMD
 is
 up
 7.
 Hood's
 up
 two


and
 AMD
 really
 trying
 to
 break
 through


potentially
 240.
 Let
 me
 check
 the


resistance
 at
 236


for
 AMD.
 The
 NASDAQ
 also
 up
 almost
 1%
 on


the
 day.
 AMD
 236
 resistance


24,000
 shares.
 Not
 a
 lot.
 It's
 not
 a


lot.
 Intel
 3670.
 That's
 also
 up


3%.


All
 right.
 That's
 green.
 That's
 green.


Amit,
 when
 you
 start
 your
 deep
 dives,


they
 will
 be
 out
 on
 Friday.
 On
 Friday,


we're
 gonna
 have
 two
 of
 them.
 We're


gonna
 have
 two
 of
 them.
 I
 was
 going
 to


leave
 that
 as
 a
 surprise,
 but
 I
 might
 as


well
 tell
 you
 guys
 right
 now.
 We're


gonna
 have
 two
 deep
 dives
 on
 Friday.
 I


didn't
 want
 to
 do
 just
 one.
 I
 wanted
 to


kind
 of
 start
 off
 the
 substack
 with
 a


bang.
 So,
 it's
 amitsdeepdives.com.


You
 can
 click
 on
 that
 right
 there
 and


subscribe
 on
 Friday.
 Both
 of
 them
 will


be
 out
 and
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 the


long
 form
 research
 on
 the
 Substack.
 So,


it's
 free
 to
 subscribe.
 No
 payw
 wall.


There
 will
 never
 be
 a
 payw
 wall.
 For


those
 that
 have
 subscribed
 already,


thank
 you.
 But
 yeah,
 we're
 gonna
 have


two
 deep
 dives.
 And
 look,
 I
 mean,
 the


demand
 for
 these
 deep
 dives
 is
 pretty


aggressive.
 And
 I'm
 very
 excited
 to
 look


into
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks.
 I'm
 still


going
 to
 try
 to
 keep
 it
 to
 two
 a
 month


because
 I
 just
 think
 to
 give
 quality


quality


uh
 deep
 dives,
 you
 really
 got
 to
 spend


time
 with
 the
 company.
 But
 yeah,
 the


goal
 will
 be
 one
 every
 two
 weeks
 and
 try


to
 give
 my
 all
 into
 going
 deeper
 on
 a


company.
 And
 I'll
 disclose
 if
 I
 buy
 it,


if
 I
 have
 a
 position
 in
 it.
 Most
 of


these
 I
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 buy.
 I


mean,
 I
 might
 throw
 a
 little bit
 of


money
 at
 it,
 but
 the
 goal
 is
 like,
 can


we
 actually
 analyze
 the
 company?
 If
 I


really
 do
 like
 it,
 then,
 you
 know,
 I'll


disclose
 if
 I
 if
 I
 have
 any
 position,


but
 they'll
 be
 out
 on
 Friday.
 Tesla


right
 here
 440.
 That's
 green
 up
 two
 and


a
 half.


That
 is
 up.
 Grab
 still
 moving.
 Google


251.
 AMD
 trying
 to
 brush
 through
 235.


Salesforce
 a
 little
 bit
 green.
 And
 then


Meta
 back
 up
 to
 720.


back
 up
 to
 720.


So,
 we
 got
 the
 substack.
 When's
 the
 only


fans?
 Dude,
 I
 cannot
 believe
 Sam
 Alman


really
 said
 yesterday
 they're
 coming
 out


with
 an
 erotica
 feature
 for
 chatbt.
 I


really
 I
 would
 expect
 Elon
 to
 say
 that


because
 of
 all
 the
 stuff
 he's
 been


tweeting
 with
 rock
 AI.
 I
 didn't
 know


OpenAI
 was
 going
 to
 go
 down
 that
 route,


but
 I
 guess
 they
 realize
 it's
 the
 most


profitable


version
 of
 uh
 utilizing
 AI.


And
 they're
 going
 for
 it.
 SMCR
 right


there
 up
 3%.
 Na'vias.
 Wow.
 19%.
 There


you
 go.
 Back
 to
 15.


That
 one
 continued
 to
 go
 green.
 Is
 your


Substack
 free?
 Yes,
 it
 will
 always
 be.


Dude,
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 pledged
 a


subs.
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 Substack
 allows


you
 to
 pledge
 a
 subscription.
 And
 a


bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 pledged
 like


like
 80
 bucks
 a
 year,
 100
 bucks
 a
 year


or
 something.
 And
 like
 you
 really
 don't


have
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 mean,
 this
 this
 this


really
 is
 not
 to
 make
 money.
 This
 is
 to


challenge
 myself
 as
 an
 investor
 to
 get


better
 at
 analyzing
 companies.
 So,
 it


will
 always
 be
 free,
 but


you
 know,
 anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 subscribe


can
 check
 it
 out.
 Na'vi
 right
 there
 up


15%
 still
 move
 or
 up
 19%
 still
 moving.


TTD,
 how's
 that
 one
 doing?
 That
 one's


been
 stuck
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months


now.
 5146
 around
 45
 to
 56.


That's
 been
 a
 bit
 more
 stuck.
 Brandon,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Where
 would


you
 roll
 Rocket
 Lab
 65
 covered
 calls
 for


10
 to
 24
 months
 to
 retain
 shares?
 Um,


probably


I
 mean
 65
 is
 not
 that
 far
 away
 from


where
 you're
 at
 unless
 you
 already
 are


in
 like
 the
 2027
 option
 chain.
 Wow,


Rocket
 Lab
 almost
 74
 with
 65.


I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 you
 really
 don't
 want


to
 lose
 the
 shares,
 I
 would
 roll
 up
 and


out
 to
 100,
 but
 it
 depends.
 If
 you're
 at


65
 for
 next
 week,
 you're
 in
 a
 much


better
 position
 to
 do
 that.
 If
 you're
 in


65
 for
 next
 year
 because
 you
 rolled
 from


like
 45
 or
 something,
 you're
 in
 a
 worse


position.
 But
 look,
 here's
 the
 thing.


I'm
 not
 an
 expert
 on
 Rocklab,
 but
 I


think
 it's
 expensive
 here.
 I'm
 sorry,


but
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 expensive.
 I


don't
 think
 it
 has
 to
 collapse.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 100
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 really
 ask


yourself,
 hey,
 on
 these
 covered
 calls,


how
 comfortable
 are
 you
 rolling
 right


now
 because
 you
 think
 it's
 running
 away


from
 you,
 or
 do
 you
 think
 it'll
 take
 a


retracement
 and
 you'll
 be
 able
 to
 get


out
 of
 it
 later?
 And
 that
 depends
 on
 how


convicted
 you
 are
 on
 the
 move
 on
 Rockl.


But
 if
 you
 definitively
 want
 to
 keep
 the


shares,
 I
 would
 roll
 out
 to
 a hundred


probably
 another
 year
 out.


But
 it's
 not
 just
 me,
 right?
 It's


expensive.
 I
 mean,
 bro,
 they
 they
 do
 500


million
 in
 revenue,
 $
 36
 billion


company.
 Like,
 and
 they're
 not


profitable
 either.
 Like,
 that's
 not
 even


being
 bearish.
 Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 own
 it.
 I'm


not
 selling
 a
 single
 share.
 It's
 just


like
 I
 said
 the
 same
 thing
 about
 Hood
 at


150.
 I'm
 like,
 look,
 it's
 expensive.
 I'm


not
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 saying
 they
 don't


deserve
 to
 get
 a
 multiple,
 but
 obviously


it
 is
 getting
 up
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 the


premium.


Same
 thing
 with
 AS,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 look,


AS
 has
 been
 incredible,
 but
 this
 guy
 has


zero
 dollars
 in
 revenue.
 Same
 market
 cap


as
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Now,
 one
 could
 argue


their
 potential
 is
 greater,
 but


Neutron
 could
 change
 everything.
 That
 is


fair.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 that's
 why
 you
 don't


sell.
 And
 I
 get
 it.
 I'm
 the
 guy
 who
 owns


Palanteer
 and
 Palanteer's
 like,
 I
 get


it,
 but
 I'm
 not
 selling
 Pounder
 either.


So,


the
 the
 argument
 is
 not
 necessarily


around
 do
 you
 continue
 to
 hold
 something


that's
 expensive.
 Do
 you
 continue
 to
 buy


into
 it?


And
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


difference
 here
 versus


also
 not
 selling
 or
 not.
 Strategy
 at


306.
 Micro
 Strategy
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 green
 as
 well.
 VRT,


Vertive,
 that
 one
 moving
 up
 today
 2.75%.


VRT
 and
 Vista
 were
 really
 good
 stocks
 in


2024
 when
 data
 centers
 just
 started
 to


take
 off.
 I
 mean,
 they've
 still
 done


really
 good
 in
 2025.
 VRT
 right
 there,


52%.


VST
 43%.


Both
 of
 those
 continuing


to
 get
 some
 love.


Yo,
 who
 owns
 Oaklo
 in
 the
 chat?
 Put
 in


the
 chat
 if
 you
 own
 Oakllo.
 And
 let
 me


do
 a
 poll
 on
 this.
 How
 many
 how
 many


freaking
 Oakllo
 people
 do
 we
 have?
 I'm


gonna
 guess
 it's


15%.


Which
 maybe
 is
 too
 aggressive,
 maybe


it's
 too
 conservative.
 15%
 of
 you
 guys


own
 Oklahoma.


Feel
 like
 I'm
 being
 too
 aggressive


there.
 Do
 you
 own
 Oaklo?


Because
 I
 mean,


dude,
 if
 the
 thing
 about
 Oaklo
 is
 I


wouldn't
 have
 been
 able
 to
 hold.
 If
 I


bought
 Oklahoma
 at
 20,
 I
 would
 have
 sold


at
 freaking
 50.
 I
 would
 have
 been
 I


would
 have
 been
 done.
 So,
 for
 those
 that


have
 actually
 held
 on
 to
 this
 thing
 to


190,
 which
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


people
 there
 are
 that
 legit
 held
 on
 for


the
 full
 2,000%
 move
 or
 even
 freaking


1,000%
 move,


but
 it's
 pretty
 incredible
 for
 those


that
 did.


Yeah,
 I
 was
 right.
 15%
 of
 you,
 85%
 of


you
 do
 not
 own
 Oaklow.
 Bradley
 says,
 "I


sold
 at
 120."
 Bunch
 of
 people
 saying
 I


sold
 at
 87
 88.


BB
 says
 I
 have
 100
 shares
 at
 28.
 Why
 not


just
 hold?
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 same


thing
 with
 INE.
 I'm
 not
 selling
 INE


either.
 It's
 just
 100
 shares.
 So,
 you


know,
 why
 not
 just
 hold
 it
 if
 it's
 a


small
 position?
 But


goodness,
 some
 of
 these
 names
 have


literally
 gone
 to
 the
 moon.
 AMD
 right


there
 234,
 just
 below


235.
 Yeezy
 said
 I
 bought
 at
 150,
 sold
 at


180.


Okay.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 from
 a
 trading


perspective,
 it's
 done


very
 well.


Um,


BMR
 continues
 to
 be
 stuck.
 Yes,
 it


continues
 to
 be
 stuck.
 I
 mean,
 look,


ET's
 not
 moving,
 right?
 So,
 at least


it's
 not
 below
 50.
 So,
 Ethereum
 kind
 of


holding
 on
 to
 this
 4,000
 range.
 Uh,
 one


thing
 about
 Ethereum,
 I
 forgot
 to
 show


this
 right
 here,
 but
 look
 again,


regardless
 of
 price
 action,
 the
 question


is
 looking
 at
 the
 actual
 movement
 of
 the


industry
 and
 take
 a
 look
 at
 stable
 coin


supply.
 300
 billion
 for
 the
 first
 time


just
 passed
 yesterday.
 59%
 of
 that
 is


Ethereum.


So,
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more


companies
 come
 on
 chain
 and
 that's


obviously
 creating
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum
 in


the
 overall
 stable
 coin
 ecosystem.
 Good


for
 Circle,
 Tether,
 etc.


And
 you
 know,
 given
 Ethereum's
 share
 of


that,


that's
 not
 horrible
 for
 them
 either.
 By


the
 way,
 here's
 what
 UBS
 said
 this


morning
 on
 why
 the
 bull
 market
 isn't


over.
 Number
 one,
 they
 said,
 "Resilient


consumer
 spending.
 The
 labor
 market
 is


cold,
 but
 remains
 solid,
 layoffs
 are


low,
 wages
 are
 rising,
 and
 job
 openings


are
 healthy.
 Strong
 AI
 investment.
 AI


adoption
 and
 related
 spending
 keeps


growing.
 UBS
 expects
 solid
 revenue


growth
 for
 cloud
 providers.
 And
 number


three,
 the
 Fed.
 The
 Fed
 is
 creating
 a


favorable
 backdrop.
 UBS
 believes
 the


upcoming
 earnings
 will
 reinforce
 the


bull
 market
 strength
 based
 on
 rate
 cuts


and
 earnings
 growth.
 So
 those
 are
 your


three
 reasons
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 the


investment
 managers.
 AI
 investments
 are


strong,
 the
 consumer
 is
 resilient,
 and


you
 got
 the
 Fed
 that's
 easing
 along
 with


an
 earning
 cycle
 that
 is
 relatively


strong.
 And
 so
 far
 the
 banks
 have
 proved


how
 strong
 it
 is.
 And
 that's
 their
 case


for,
 you
 know,
 ry
 we're
 likely
 to
 see


closer
 to
 that
 7,000
 potentially
 7200


level
 on
 the
 S&P.


And
 you
 know,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 rebound


from
 or
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 the
 rebound


from
 Friday.
 It
 definitely
 helps
 bolster


some
 of
 that
 argument
 right
 here.
 Clean


Spark,
 that's
 up
 5%.


That
 continues
 to
 go
 green
 4
 and
 a.5%
 on


the
 day.


Um,


and
 AMD
 still
 well
 AMD
 losing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 its
 juice.
 235


back
 down
 to
 two
 to
 233.
 Another


argument
 for
 data
 centers
 is
 robotics.


Here's
 what
 the
 ARM
 CEO
 that
 had
 a


partnership
 with
 OpenAI
 yesterday
 said


about
 why
 I
 mean
 he
 he
 said
 something


that
 was
 quite
 surprising.
 He
 said


robotics
 will
 be
 bigger
 than
 the
 entire


market
 for
 data
 centers.


So
 if
 you
 have
 robots
 in
 the
 field,
 we


have
 500
 million
 robots.
 What
 is
 the


chip
 market
 going
 to
 look
 like
 for


robotics?
 How
 what
 makes
 it
 different


than
 what
 we
 have
 today
 on
 the
 embedded


side
 versus
 the
 data
 center
 side
 for
 AI


infra?


Yeah,
 physical
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


gigantic
 market.
 I
 mean
 today
 quite


candidly
 they're
 using


bigger
 than
 data
 centers.


Uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 so.
 Uh
 because
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 today
 they
 largely
 use


repurposed
 automotive
 chips,
 right?


Things
 that
 have
 functional
 safety
 uh


compliance
 around
 ADAS,
 but
 they're
 not


specific
 for
 actuators
 or
 specific
 for


smaller
 parts
 of
 the
 joint.
 So
 physical


AI,
 particularly
 AI
 that
 can
 learn
 uh
 is


I
 think
 going
 to
 be
 a
 giant
 market


because
 the
 robots
 themselves
 will
 have


tens
 of
 chips,
 hundreds
 of
 chips.
 So


yeah,
 from
 a
 unit
 standpoint,
 it
 could


be
 huge.
 Uh
 the
 numbers
 are
 going
 to
 be


well
 beyond
 what
 we
 what
 we
 see
 today.


You
 started
 so


dude
 that
 was
 pretty
 crazy
 when
 I
 heard


that
 yesterday.
 I
 mean
 the
 data
 center


market
 is
 pretty
 freaking
 massive
 and


the
 reason
 I
 ran
 and
 all
 these
 other


companies
 are
 even
 running
 is
 because
 of


how
 massive
 it
 is.
 Pounder
 by
 the
 way


back
 up
 to
 183.
 But
 if
 he's
 talking


about
 physical
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 even


bigger
 market
 than
 data
 centers,
 we're


talking
 about
 another
 basically
 trillion


dollar
 industry
 with
 hundreds
 of


billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 capex
 spend
 by


probably
 figure,
 electronic,
 Amazon,


Tesla,
 all
 the
 companies
 that
 matter


when
 it
 comes
 to
 robots
 uh
 continuing


to
 increase
 the
 necessity
 for
 all
 this


compute
 capacity


and
 that
 ends
 up
 being
 you
 know
 a


tailwind
 that
 is
 also
 hard
 to
 deny.
 I


mean,
 Jensen's
 been
 pretty
 optimistic


about
 humanoid
 robotics
 as
 well.
 He's,


you
 know,
 not
 shied
 away
 from
 saying
 how


important
 they
 are.
 Actually,
 I
 do
 have


a
 clip
 of
 Jensen.
 This
 is
 from
 him


yesterday.
 He
 was
 talking
 with
 Citadel


about
 why
 robots
 continue
 to
 be
 the
 next


big
 S-curve.


Let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 thought
 experiment.


You
 know,
 why
 robotics
 is
 so
 close?


Um,
 as
 you
 know,
 as
 you
 know,


you
 can
 now
 prompt
 an
 AI
 and
 it
 could


generate
 uh,
 you
 know,
 prompt
 uh,
 Jensen


picking
 up
 a
 bottle,
 uh,
 opening
 it
 and


taking
 a
 sip.
 Okay.
 And
 it
 would


generate
 the
 video
 of
 me,
 right,
 opening


up
 a
 bottle,
 taking
 a
 sip.
 Well,
 if
 it


can
 generate
 all
 that,
 why
 can't
 it


maneuver
 a
 robot
 to
 do
 that?
 H


and
 so
 you
 your
 thought
 experiment
 would


suggest
 that
 you
 know
 that's
 probably


very
 likely.
 Now
 if
 you
 could
 design
 a


digital
 chauffeur
 that
 could
 drive
 a


car,


why
 can't
 you
 have
 a
 robot
 a
 physical


robot
 drive
 a
 car?


And
 so
 so
 if
 a
 physical
 robot
 if
 you
 can


embody
 a
 physical
 robot
 to
 even
 drive
 a


car,
 why
 can't
 you
 embody
 a
 pick
 and
 you


know
 pick
 and
 place
 arm
 or
 any
 type
 of


robotics?
 And
 so
 notice
 we
 have
 the


ability
 to
 embody
 almost
 anything.
 We


could
 pick
 up
 pick
 up
 uh
 knives
 and


forks
 and
 it
 becomes
 an
 extension
 of
 our


body
 and
 somehow
 we
 articulate
 it.
 We


could
 pick
 up
 a
 baseball
 bat
 and
 use
 it


as
 an
 extension
 of
 our
 body.


Um
 and
 so
 we
 embody
 these
 physical


extensions.
 future
 future
 AIs
 will
 be


able
 to
 embody,


you
 know,
 and
 manipulate
 a
 car
 um


robotic
 arms,
 a
 human
 or
 robot,


a
 surgical
 robot,


um
 you
 know,
 so
 on
 so
 forth.
 And
 so
 so
 I


think
 these
 two
 these
 two
 markets
 are


are
 within
 reach.


Again,
 Jensen,
 he's
 also
 talking
 his


book,
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 sell
 a
 lot
 of


chips
 if
 physical
 AI
 ends
 up
 taking
 off.


Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 market
 is
 as


big
 as
 he
 thinks,
 then
 you're
 going
 to


see
 a
 lot
 more
 chips
 get
 sold
 because
 of


it.
 Jensen
 did
 deliver
 a
 DGX
 Spark
 chip


to
 Sam
 and
 Greg
 Brockman
 yesterday.
 He


delivered
 this
 to
 Elon
 a
 couple
 days


ago.


So,
 you
 got
 Jensen
 continuing


to
 make
 the
 rounds.
 APLD,
 that
 one


continues
 to
 do
 very
 well.
 Look
 at
 that.


3976,
 13%
 of
 the
 day.
 Na'vi,
 that
 one


continues
 to
 move.
 I
 think
 we'll
 have


Jose
 on
 tomorrow.
 and
 he'll
 give
 us
 his


thoughts
 on
 Na'vi,
 APLD,


AMD,
 etc.
 But
 I
 think
 he
 owns
 all
 of


those.
 So,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 big
 two


weeks
 for
 his
 portfolio.
 Na'vi,
 right?


They're
 breaking
 through
 1539.
 Again,


they
 had
 the
 Nvidia
 partnership
 two
 days


ago.
 That's
 what
 really
 sent
 them


flying.
 I
 mean,
 any
 of
 these
 companies


announced
 a
 partnership
 with
 OpenAI
 or


Nvidia,
 it
 changes
 the
 trajectory
 of


their
 narrative.


Does
 it
 necessarily
 mean
 their
 stock


becomes
 more
 uh
 prone
 to
 be
 successful


in
 terms
 of
 like
 earnings
 growth?
 Not


really.
 But
 it
 does
 mean
 the
 narrative


on
 the
 perception
 of
 that
 increases


dramatically.
 And
 then
 it's
 up
 to
 the


company
 to
 execute.
 But


this
 market
 is
 not
 afraid
 of
 getting


excited
 for
 those
 narratives,
 especially


if
 it's
 in
 a
 sector
 like
 AI.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 that's
 not
 easily


slowing
 down.
 RXRX,
 is
 that
 moving?


Recursion
 Pharmaceuticals,
 that's
 up
 14%


today.
 Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 biotech


names
 that
 are
 moving.
 Yeah,
 CRM
 was
 the


only
 stock
 that
 was
 down
 on
 the
 OpenAI


partnership
 news.


Um,
 oh,
 here's
 a
 new
 stat
 for
 you
 guys.


Corporations
 now
 own
 over
 1.02
 million


Bitcoin
 after
 buying
 the
 most
 Bitcoin


ever
 in
 Q3.
 Wow.


5%
 of
 the
 Bitcoin
 supply,
 huh?


that
 that's
 all
 your
 uh
 your
 your
 crypto


treasuries
 that
 are
 out
 there.


But
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 the
 Amazons
 or


Microsofts,
 their
 shareholders
 rejected


the
 ability
 for
 them
 to
 to
 buy.
 You


know,
 if
 Meta
 shareholders
 when
 when


Zucks
 had
 the
 vote
 a
 year
 ago
 actually


voted
 yes
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin,
 I
 feel
 like


Zucks
 would
 have
 been
 so
 happy
 buying


Bitcoin.
 He
 seems
 like
 a
 guy
 who's
 like


more
 on
 the
 side
 of
 yeah,
 let's
 just


like
 keep
 it
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet.
 But


shareholders
 rejected
 the
 proposal
 and


that's
 why
 they
 have
 not
 been
 been
 able


to
 buy.


Uh
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 reports
 China
 is


deliberately
 tanking
 markets
 to
 force


Trump
 into
 major
 concessions
 and
 trade


talks.


Uh
 Baba,
 are
 we
 down?
 China's
 up
 today.


So,
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 thinks
 that


China
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 Trump
 to
 give
 him


some
 cassette.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 that's
 why


I
 think
 the
 markets
 are
 also
 up
 today.
 I


kind
 of
 think
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 the


markets
 are
 just
 like,
 dude,
 this
 whole


soybean
 nonsense
 is
 just
 two
 people


going
 back
 and
 forth


and
 or
 two
 entities
 going
 back
 and
 forth


and
 it's
 not
 real.
 Just
 like
 in
 April,


it
 wasn't
 real.
 Soybeans,
 cooking
 oil,


export
 controls
 on
 rare
 earths,
 none
 of


that
 shit's
 real.
 It's
 all
 just
 a
 game


they're
 playing
 with
 each
 other
 and
 the


stock
 market
 is
 collateral
 damage
 there.


But,
 you
 know,
 that
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 dip


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 don't
 think


that
 it's
 actually
 real.
 Oaklo
 still
 up


186
 on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 finally
 making
 a


push
 for
 236.


He
 got
 to
 23550
 right
 here.


Pretty
 big
 day,
 dude.
 That's
 a
 $17
 move


on
 AMD.


A
 17
 Delores
 move
 for
 AMD.
 Asana
 still


pumping.
 That
 was
 up
 20%.
 Sana
 34%
 that


is
 all
 Eric
 Jackson
 I
 would
 imagine
 that


is
 all
 him
 hut
 from
 yesterday
 that
 is
 up


12%.
 And
 then
 better
 mortgage
 play
 that


is
 up
 8%.


Iroot
 is
 up
 44%
 today.


Irbt
 Why
 is
 this
 thing
 up
 44%.


$170
 million
 market
 cap.


Didn't
 these
 guys
 get
 bought
 out?


I
 thought
 these
 guys
 got
 bought
 out
 a


while
 ago.
 IBT.


Did
 they
 partner
 with
 OpenAI?
 Like,
 uh,


I
 Robot
 is
 leaning
 into
 a
 major


turnaround
 story
 under
 a
 new
 chief


marketing
 officer.


Um,


we
 started
 this
 company
 and
 will


continue
 to
 lead
 it,
 she
 said,
 signaling


confidence
 in
 their
 brand
 power.
 She


noted
 that
 iRoot
 is
 benefiting
 from


renewed
 public
 interest
 in
 robotics


fueled
 by
 Elon
 Musk's
 humanoid


ambitions.


Dude,
 all
 she
 said
 is


we
 are
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 robotics.


That's
 it.
 That's
 all
 you
 needed
 for
 a


44%
 move.


I
 don't
 see
 any
 partnerships.
 I
 don't


see
 any
 numbers.
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 like


integrations
 with
 other
 LLMs
 or
 anything


like
 I
 see
 I
 just
 see
 a
 chief
 marketing


officer's
 comments


on
 how
 much
 they
 are
 going
 to
 lean
 into


quote
 unquote
 the
 robotics
 industry.


See
 that
 shit's
 weird,
 bro.
 Like
 that


like
 like
 a
 stock
 goes
 up
 44%
 because


the
 CMO
 says
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 excited


about
 robotics.
 Average
 volume
 two


million
 today
 8
 million
 in
 in
 in
 an
 hour


like
 like
 oh
 a
 robotics
 company
 focusing


on
 robotics
 bullish
 44%.
 Like
 what's


going
 on
 bro?
 Some
 of
 this
 [ __ ]
 is
 weird


bro.
 I'm
 like
 some
 of
 this
 again
 it
 is


not
 the
 in
 my
 opinion
 death
 of
 a
 bull


market.
 This
 company
 is
 $200
 million


right?
 So
 like
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 zero,
 who


cares?
 But
 a
 45%
 move
 I
 is
 is is
 the


market
 having
 such
 ready
 hands
 that


people
 are
 ready
 to
 pull
 the
 trigger
 on


a
 robot
 company
 saying
 we
 want
 to
 lean


into
 robotics.
 Like
 what
 is
 that?
 That


doesn't
 make
 sense.


I
 mean
 it
 does
 make
 sense,
 but
 it's
 it's


not
 what
 you
 normally
 see
 when
 a
 company


just
 tries
 to
 put
 out
 a
 statement
 like


that.
 Now,
 they
 might
 be
 shorted


heavily,
 so
 there
 could
 be
 a
 squeeze


going
 on,
 which
 would
 explain
 a
 little


bit
 more.


Um,
 but
 still,
 that's
 a
 pretty
 pretty


massive
 move.


Um,
 yeah,
 28%
 short.
 All right,
 so
 I


guess
 you're
 getting
 a
 squeeze
 here.
 I


mean,
 that
 that
 that
 probably
 explains


it.
 any
 bullish
 catalyst
 like
 the
 CMO


talking
 about


robotics
 was
 enough
 to
 potentially
 get


the
 shorts
 to
 cover,


but
 you
 still
 had
 to
 have
 that
 initial


amount
 of
 buying
 to
 even
 get
 the
 squeeze


to
 take
 place.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 people


bought
 on
 those
 comments,


it's
 pretty
 wild
 to
 see.


Next
 up,
 you're
 going to
 have
 Coca-Cola


focuses
 on
 soda.
 Boom.
 44%.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 when
 stuff
 like
 this


happens,
 you
 either
 chase
 it
 or
 you
 sit


back
 and
 say,
 "I
 don't
 care."
 You
 I


think
 it's
 one
 or
 the
 other,
 and
 you
 got


you
 got
 to
 pick
 and
 choose
 which
 battles


you
 want
 to
 fight


because
 the
 risk
 associated
 with
 them


could
 be
 massive
 reward,
 but
 it
 also


could
 be
 massive
 bag
 holding,


which
 is
 not
 necessarily
 fun.


Um,


yeah,
 they
 could
 they
 should
 have


partnered
 with
 Will
 Smith.
 That
 would


have
 made
 it
 better.
 That
 would
 have


been
 it
 easier.
 We're
 in
 a
 bull
 market.


anything
 goes.
 See,
 but
 that's
 not
 the


healthiest
 bull
 market.
 A
 bull
 market


where
 it's
 a,
 you
 know,
 structural


tailwind
 across
 macro
 and
 um


technological


perspectives
 is
 healthy.
 A
 bull
 market


where
 things
 go
 up
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 going


up
 is
 2021.
 Now,
 granted,
 I
 think
 the


macro
 and
 tech
 tailwinds
 are
 so
 strong


that
 it
 overpowers
 the
 frothiness
 of


anything
 going
 up
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 going


up,
 which
 is
 also
 a
 function
 of
 a
 bull


market.


But
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 you
 want
 to
 see


that
 become
 the
 norm.
 Like
 we
 want
 this


thing
 to
 last
 for
 the
 next
 5
 10
 years.


And
 froth
 in
 the
 system
 definitely


doesn't
 help
 that
 playing
 out.
 ETH
 below


4,000.
 ETH
 very
 close
 to
 below
 four.


Where
 is
 Fartcoin?
 We
 haven't
 looked
 at


last
 time
 we
 looked
 at
 it
 was
 like


a$120,
 right?


Okay.
 So,
 some
 froth
 came
 out
 of
 Fcoin.


41
 cents.
 It's
 down
 50%
 in
 a
 month.


It's
 still
 worth
 half
 a
 billion
 dollars.


Market
 cap
 is
 still
 half
 a
 billion,


but


it
 is
 down
 over
 the
 past
 month.


All
 right,
 let's
 see.
 Let's
 see
 what


else
 we
 got.


Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see
 what


else
 we
 got.
 Do
 we
 have
 any
 macro
 data


today?
 We
 had
 Bent
 talk.
 We
 had
 uh
 Greer


talk.
 What's
 your
 opinion
 on
 Regetti
 and


Quantum?
 Look,
 I'm
 not
 buying
 it.
 I


wouldn't
 short
 it.
 I
 can't
 touch
 those


names,
 dude.
 I
 just
 can't.
 It's
 It's


really
 tough
 to
 buy
 into
 those
 stocks


for
 me.
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 full


fundamentally
 understand
 the
 quantum


industry
 to
 be
 super
 excited
 to
 buy


those.


Is
 it
 a
 sell?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 a


different
 breed.
 If
 I'm
 up
 like
 50%,


I'll
 sell.
 So,
 anyone
 who's
 up
 freaking


on
 a
 trade,
 obviously,
 if
 it's
 like
 a


long-term
 holding,
 I'm
 holding
 it.
 But


if
 it
 if
 it
 if
 if
 I
 got
 into
 Regetti
 for


the
 hell
 of
 it
 at
 10
 bucks
 and
 it's
 at


50,
 I'm
 out.
 I'm
 not
 staying
 till
 it


gets
 to
 100.
 But
 then
 again,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 bought
 at
 10
 and
 you
 could
 have


been
 out
 at
 20,
 you
 would
 have
 missed


getting
 up
 to
 50.
 So,
 it
 really
 comes


down
 to
 how
 much
 risk
 tolerance
 you
 have


on
 some
 of these.
 Let's
 do
 this
 question


in
 the
 chat
 as
 well


and
 kind
 of
 see
 what's
 going
 on
 from


there.
 First
 of
 all,
 88%
 of
 you
 said
 you


don't
 own
 Oaklo.


Okay,
 so
 let's
 do
 this
 question.
 I
 think


we
 haven't
 asked
 this
 question
 before.


How
 long
 do
 you
 hold
 a
 swing
 trade?


One
 month,


three
 months
 plus,
 three
 months,


few
 weeks,


six
 months
 plus.
 Feel
 like
 everyone
 has


their
 own
 time
 frame
 for
 swing
 trades,


but
 that
 tends
 to
 be
 the
 bucket
 you


would
 put
 them
 in.
 Here's
 uh
 some
 more


updates
 and
 some
 coverage
 right
 here
 on


ASML
 that
 had
 earnings
 yesterday.


An
 earnings
 beat
 and
 a
 slight
 revenue


miss,
 but
 that's
 not
 the
 story.
 The


story
 is
 really
 what
 uh
 the
 company
 says


about
 where
 semiconductor
 demand
 is


heading.
 Three
 things
 matter.
 First,
 the


AI
 boom
 is
 broadening.
 The
 CEO
 said


momentum
 around
 AI
 investments
 is


extending
 to
 more
 customers,
 including


advanced
 DRAM
 players.
 That's
 more


advanced
 memory
 players.
 And
 that's
 also


helping
 semicap
 equipment
 names
 today


like
 KLA
 and
 Lamb.
 both
 of
 those
 names


turning
 at least
 three%
 higher.


Secondly,
 ASML's
 got
 a
 monopoly
 on
 the


extreme
 ultraviolet
 lithography
 machines


needed
 for
 those
 chips
 and
 orders


roughly
 doubled
 year-over-year
 to
 5.54


billion
 euros.
 That
 is
 real
 demand.
 And


then
 second,
 I
 should
 actually
 say
 now,


China
 ASML
 expects
 sales
 there
 to


decline
 significantly
 next
 year
 after


two
 very
 strong
 years.
 Call
 it


normalization
 rather
 than
 collapse.


They're
 no
 longer
 stockpiling
 ahead
 of


export
 restrictions.
 And
 then
 lastly,


third,
 the
 growth
 outlook.
 ASML
 said


2026
 won't
 be
 worse
 than
 2025.
 But


analysts
 are
 reading
 it
 as
 a
 floor,
 not


a
 ceiling.
 Caner
 Fitzgerald
 wrote
 that


the
 sun
 is
 finally
 coming
 out
 and
 called


this
 a
 bottom
 for
 ASML
 2026
 in


particular,
 with
 2027
 looking
 stronger.


Wedbush
 added
 that
 EUV
 tool
 demand
 is


running
 better
 than
 expected,
 driven
 by


incremental
 AI
 data
 center
 buildouts


that
 we
 constantly
 talk
 about
 every


single
 day.
 And
 so
 this
 actually
 matters


big
 time
 for
 TSMC,
 which
 reports
 to
 on


Thursday
 morning
 before
 the
 bell.
 ASML's


stronger
 than
 feared
 outlook
 could


signal
 TSMC
 lifts
 capex
 plans
 uh
 next


year
 to
 support
 AI
 demand.
 And
 if
 TSMC


confirms
 accelerated
 spending,
 then
 that


kind
 of
 validates
 the
 entire


semiconductor
 buildout
 cycle
 that
 should


have
 legs
 beyond
 2025
 and
 2020.


So
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 the
 update
 from


TSMC
 tonight.
 Ethereum,
 by
 the
 way,
 just


below
 4,000.
 But
 ASML
 earnings,
 again,


you
 could
 tell
 management
 wasn't
 the


most
 bullish
 on
 that
 call.
 Stock
 right


here
 is
 up
 3%,
 but
 they
 did
 do
 some


really
 good
 buybacks
 um
 back
 when
 it
 got


hit
 30%.
 Uh
 TSM
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


the
 signal
 around
 where
 semiconductor


demand
 is
 going.
 Uh
 I
 put
 another
 poll


in
 the
 chat.
 What
 percentage
 hold
 for
 a


swing
 trade
 do
 you
 do?
 A
 lot
 of
 people


said
 three
 months
 was
 the
 average
 for


the
 time
 frame.
 Most
 people
 right
 here


are
 saying
 about
 10%.


10%
 which
 is
 fair.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're


playing
 with
 a
 sizable
 amount
 of
 money,


right,
 10%
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 move,


but
 obviously
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 option,


the
 time
 frame
 on
 the
 option.
 If
 you
 do


an
 option
 in
 the
 first
 place
 if
 you
 just


buy
 raw
 equity,


I
 feel
 like
 for
 me,
 dude,
 like
 if
 it's
 a


really
 quick
 swing,
 like
 five
 to
 seven%


and
 you
 know,
 five
 to
 seven%
 on
 your


money
 if
 you
 do
 that
 in
 a
 week
 or
 two,


that's
 amazing.
 that
 is
 that
 is
 not
 easy


to
 do.
 If
 you're
 a
 day
 trader,
 you're


probably
 looking
 for,
 you
 know,
 less


than
 a
 percentage
 point
 a
 day
 with
 big


money.
 But
 if
 you're
 working
 with
 an


option,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 what
 Jason


does.
 You
 know,
 he
 does
 usually
 three
 to


six
 months,
 and
 he's
 looking
 for
 a
 a
 one


or
 two
 X
 if
 he
 can
 really
 nail
 the


direction


of
 where
 where
 the
 stock
 is
 going.


Tenko
 says,
 "I'm
 up
 900%
 on
 call


options.
 Still
 haven't
 sold
 yet
 with


three
 months
 left."
 What
 stock?
 Tenko


got
 you
 that
 900
 bag.
 I
 mean,
 that's


incredible,
 dude.


Not
 bad
 to
 see
 a
 9x
 here.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 do
 it.
 I
 think
 my
 dad's
 up
 7x


on
 his
 SoFi
 calls
 that
 he
 bought
 at


seven
 bucks.


So,
 some
 of
 these
 things
 have
 just


completely
 printed.
 So
 far,
 right,


they're
 back
 below
 29


at
 2860.


AMD,
 are
 we
 still
 move?
 Wow.
 AMD,
 we


broke
 through
 236,
 237.


Okay,
 let
 me
 check
 238
 resistance


and
 see
 if
 that's
 on
 the
 way.


238.


Um


46,000
 shares.
 46,000.


I'm
 up
 15x
 ons
 calls.


Dude,
 some
 of
 these
 leaps
 have
 just


printed.


Absolutely
 printed.


Um,


have
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 nuclear
 spack?


Yeah,
 we
 looked
 at
 it.
 That's
 Hand,


right?
 H
 O
 N
 D.


Wow,
 it's
 up
 another
 22%
 today,


dude.


Or
 wasn't
 it
 up
 like
 10%
 yesterday?


Yeah,
 past
 five
 days,
 it's
 up
 73%.


I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 spack
 in
 the
 nuclear


uh
 ecosystem.
 It's
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 bid.


And
 there
 you
 go.
 It's
 catching
 a
 bid.


So


that's
 what
 we
 got.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 so


again,
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 do
 you
 take
 the


risk
 on
 this?
 I'm
 not
 taking
 the
 risk.


I'm
 sorry.
 Just
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 been


very
 riskrone


over
 the
 past
 two
 years,
 obviously
 with


pounder
 and
 hood.
 Um,
 but
 on
 some
 of


this
 [ __ ]
 like
 I
 can
 take
 a
 risk
 if
 I


understand
 it,
 and
 I
 really
 believe
 in


the
 company.
 A
 spack
 that's
 in
 the


nuclear
 space,
 people
 throwing
 money
 at


this
 [ __ ]
 just
 in
 case
 it
 runs.
 I
 I'm


not
 like
 I'm
 not
 built
 to
 take
 that
 type


of
 risk.
 I'm
 just
 not


just
 philosophically,
 I
 I
 can't
 do
 that,


bro.
 Money
 is
 too
 precious
 to
 just
 throw


it
 at
 something
 like
 that,
 even
 if
 it


works.


So,
 it's
 tough.
 It's
 tough
 to


just
 throw
 stuff.
 And
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


have
 my
 little
 swing
 trades
 for
 fun
 all


the
 time,
 but
 like


it
 is
 tough
 to
 easily
 think
 that


those
 are
 definitely
 going
 to
 work.
 Bit


farms
 right
 there.
 That's
 up
 three
 and
 a


half,
 six,
 3.6%
 as
 well.


And
 gold
 continues
 to
 move.


I
 usually
 keep
 my
 leaps
 at
 2
 to
 3%


portfolio
 size.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 last


year
 I
 kept
 it
 at
 like
 50%.
 So
 that's


what
 I
 mean.
 It's
 like
 I'm
 not
 afraid
 of


taking
 risk.
 It's
 just
 it
 has
 to
 be


super
 well
 calculated.


And
 usually
 when
 the
 stock
 is
 not
 up
 5x


or
 73%
 in
 5
 days,
 that's
 when
 the
 risk


becomes
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 in
 terms
 of


the
 upside
 for
 reward


versus
 just
 piling
 in.
 Amazon
 right
 here


continues
 to
 get
 hit
 215.


Looks
 like
 that
 DOJ
 narrative
 that
 was


with
 Google
 and
 hurting
 it
 is
 not
 the


same
 exact
 narrative,
 but
 it's


definitely
 a
 narrative
 for
 Amazon
 that's


not
 helping.


That
 might
 be
 where
 the
 opportunity
 is.


Where
 is
 Bitcoin?
 Are
 we
 below?
 Are
 we


below
 110?
 We
 are
 just
 above
 110.
 111


on
 Bitcoin.


IBM,
 did
 that
 make
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 move


today?
 You
 know,
 IBM
 quantum
 that's


getting
 into
 it
 as
 well.
 Also,
 the
 other


reason
 why
 Quantum's
 up
 this
 week,
 IBM


up
 2%
 is
 because
 JP
 Morgan
 did
 say


they're
 investing
 more
 in
 quantum.


didn't
 specify
 how
 much,
 but
 it
 was
 like


part
 of
 this
 memo
 that
 Jamie
 Diamond
 put


out
 and
 that's
 what
 got
 the
 street,


I
 think,
 a
 bit
 more
 excited
 as
 well.


Um,
 let's
 just
 finish
 up
 with
 Gersonner


here
 because
 we
 didn't
 finish
 up
 his


last
 couple
 minutes,
 but
 let's
 get
 his


kind
 of
 final
 thoughts
 on
 the
 market
 and


we'll
 go
 from
 there.


Incremental
 market
 share
 to
 AI
 basically


has
 gone
 to
 Nvidia,
 right?
 AMD
 missed


the
 wave,
 but
 to
 Lisa's
 credit,
 she


raised
 her
 hand
 and
 said,
 "I'm
 betting


the
 farm.
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 10%
 of
 my


company
 to
 OpenAI,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 bet


that
 the
 MI450
 is
 going
 to
 work,
 and


it's
 going
 to
 be
 competitive
 with


Nvidia."
 That's
 not
 exactly
 the
 position


of
 strength
 that
 you
 want
 to
 be
 coming


at
 it,
 but
 it's
 also
 a
 recognition.
 Lisa


said,
 "We're
 in
 year
 two
 of
 a
 10-year


super
 cycle
 to
 build
 out
 the
 compute
 in


America.
 If
 you're
 not
 on
 the
 AI
 wave,


then
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 participate
 in


all
 that
 upside.


When
 you
 think
 about
 the
 big
 LLMs,


open
 AAI
 at least
 clearly
 seems
 like


they
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 winner.


Google,
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 you
 think


anthropic
 lands
 in
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 know


you
 own
 meta.


Y,


they're
 trying
 to
 play
 this
 game,
 but


playing
 in
 an
 open
 source
 way.
 Does
 that


work?


Yeah.
 So,
 let's
 let's
 bucket
 it
 into


consumer
 and
 enterprise.
 I
 think
 that's


the
 easiest
 way.
 On
 the
 consumer
 side,


I've
 invested
 in
 three
 or
 four
 super


cycles
 now.
 The
 internet
 super
 cycle,


the
 social,
 mobile,
 etc.
 The
 winner


tends
 to
 be
 winner
 take
 most,
 right?
 So,


Google
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 competitors,
 20


competitors
 in
 search,
 they
 all
 have


pretty
 good
 technologies,
 but
 Google


consumed
 98%
 of
 all
 the
 upside
 ever


associated
 with
 search.
 Meta
 in
 the
 uh


in
 in
 the
 case
 of
 social,
 Apple


obviously
 with
 the
 app
 store.
 I
 think


we
 know
 Altimter
 has
 a
 massive
 position


in
 open
 AI
 and
 so
 he
 continues
 to


believe
 those
 consumer
 startups
 are


going to
 win.
 AMD
 really
 pushing
 for


240.
 Uh
 we
 just
 broke
 238,
 right?
 That


was
 40,000
 shares.
 239
 resistance.


15,000.


15,00
 This
 is
 a
 9%
 day
 for
 AMD
 folks


with
 no
 news
 outside
 of
 a
 price
 target


increase.


But
 besides
 the
 upgrade,
 there's


nothing.
 There's
 no
 like
 massive
 open
 AI


deal.
 I
 mean,
 you
 did
 have
 the
 Oracle


deal
 yesterday.
 That
 was
 actually
 pretty


important
 news
 that
 and
 the
 stock
 was


flat.
 So
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 delayed


reaction
 right
 here.


But
 AMD
 two
 bucks
 away
 from
 breaking


through
 those
 alltime
 highs.
 Nvidia
 did


get
 another
 upgrade,
 but
 that
 one
 not


really
 moving
 in
 the
 same
 way.


That
 stock


still
 up
 about
 1%
 at
 uh
 at
 182.


Yeah,
 this
 this
 100%
 correct.
 The
 Oracle


deal
 got
 muted
 by
 the
 macro
 stuff


yesterday.
 That's
 fair.
 I
 mean
 that
 dude


did
 50,000
 GPUs
 from
 Oracle
 and
 AMD.


That
 was
 a
 that
 was
 an
 important


headline
 yesterday
 and
 that
 was
 a
 great


headline
 to
 follow
 up
 the
 OpenAI
 stuff.


It
 showed
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


momentum
 Lisa
 Sue
 was
 building
 but
 then


the
 soybean
 stuff
 kind
 of
 ruined
 it.


It
 looks
 like
 the
 market's
 moving
 on


from
 250


on
 the
 googs
 so
 right
 here
 at
 28.
 Grab


did
 get
 a
 price
 target
 upgrade
 to
 70


bucks
 from
 City
 Bank
 yesterday.
 So
 now


they
 have
 three
 targets
 on
 the
 street
 at


seven
 a
 couple
 above
 eight
 again.
 Q3


earnings
 November
 3rd.
 That's
 going
 to


really
 be
 where
 we
 potentially
 see
 a


rerating,


but
 that
 will
 be


what
 we
 mainly
 have
 to
 watch
 out
 for
 in


terms
 of
 upcoming
 catalyst.
 SMCI
 is
 up


2.3.
 That
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Apple's


up
 one.
 Amcore,
 are
 we
 past
 31?
 We
 are


trying
 to
 get
 above
 31.
 30.85
 on
 Amcore.


That's
 up
 3%
 as
 well
 on
 the
 day.


Um


70.
 Oh,
 did
 I
 say
 70?


I
 meant
 seven.


70
 would
 be
 legit,
 bro.
 70.
 That'd
 be


awesome.
 Well,
 seven
 bucks.


We're
 looking
 for
 seven.
 Soundhound.


That
 one's
 still
 moving
 at
 22


20
 21.72.
 All right.
 So,
 I
 think
 the


story
 of
 the
 day
 is
 as
 follows.
 Uh


number
 one
 is
 the
 China
 soybean
 stuff
 is


being
 perceived
 based
 on
 the
 price


action
 that
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now
 as
 a


negotiating


um
 I
 guess
 leverage
 forming
 event
 on


both
 sides.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 the


market's
 like,
 hey,
 you
 know,
 let's


let's
 put
 both
 kids
 in
 in
 the
 in
 a
 in
 a


room
 together,
 give
 them
 a
 timeout,
 and


they'll
 figure
 it
 out.
 And
 hopefully


that
 will
 happen
 in
 South
 Korea
 when


they
 meet
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 couple


months.
 So
 that
 might
 be
 not
 that
 big
 of


a
 structural
 issue.
 JPAL
 said
 yesterday


they're
 going
 to
 stop
 quantitative


timing.
 That's
 bullish.
 Earnings
 on
 the


banks
 phenomenal.
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 Bank


of
 America,
 City,
 JP
 Morgan,
 if
 you


rewind
 earlier
 in
 the
 show,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 bank
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 Morgan


Stanley
 beat
 by
 35
 freaking
 percent.
 I


mean,
 you're
 telling
 me
 the
 tech


companies
 aren't
 going
 to
 have
 good


earnings
 and
 banks
 are
 beating
 by
 almost


40%
 on
 EPS.
 That
 continues
 to
 be
 a
 very


strong
 narrative.
 And
 then
 based
 on
 all


the
 other
 headlines
 we
 covered
 this


morning
 about
 the
 40
 billion
 data
 center


investment
 with
 Nvidia
 and
 Black
 Rockck,


AMD
 Oracle,
 50,000
 GPU
 deal,
 more
 and


more
 chips
 being
 sent
 to
 XAI
 and
 OpenAI


from
 Jensen,
 these
 ideas
 around
 robotics


continuing
 to
 gain
 momentum,
 all
 of


those
 tailwinds
 along
 with
 the
 general


October
 volatility


is
 likely
 why
 we're
 seeing
 a
 Vshape


potentially
 back
 to
 the
 upside.
 And
 then


on
 top
 of
 that,
 you
 got
 the
 Trump


administration
 uh
 that
 put
 out
 this
 memo


today
 from
 the
 army
 around
 in
 investing


in
 nuclear
 energy
 and
 that's
 what
 helped


all
 your
 nuclear
 stocks
 today.
 So
 I


think
 you
 put
 all
 of
 that
 together
 and


it
 kind
 of
 hurts
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 bearish


momentum
 from
 Sunday
 or
 from
 from
 Friday


and
 as
 a
 result
 I
 think
 that's
 why


stocks
 are
 doing
 their
 thing
 right
 here.


It's
 not
 too
 bad.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 the
 day.


Troy,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 What
 do


you
 mean
 when
 you
 say
 leap?
 LEAP
 is
 just


a
 longterm
 option.
 So
 usually
 you
 can
 do


leap
 puts,
 leap
 calls,
 but
 they
 tend
 to


be
 365
 days
 out.
 And
 you
 basically
 buy


time.
 So
 I
 have
 leaps
 on
 grab
 for
 $10


January
 2027.
 I
 am
 betting
 that
 Grab


will
 get
 to
 10.
 Uh
 right
 now
 it's
 at
 six


in
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half.
 And
 if
 I'm
 right,


I
 usually
 get
 an
 alpha
 based
 on
 that


call
 option
 contract
 against
 the


underlying
 of
 just
 buying
 the
 stock


itself.
 But
 it
 is
 risky
 because
 shares


don't
 expire,
 options
 do.
 So
 leaps
 are


uh
 leaps
 are
 one
 you're
 out.
 Bob,
 thank


you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.


Appreciate
 it.
 Andy,
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member
 as
 well.
 Matt


said,
 "Thank
 you
 for
 the
 TA
 yesterday.


Really
 helped
 with
 what
 Jason
 said.


Matt,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Thank


you
 for
 being
 a
 channel
 member
 and
 thank


you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as
 well
 on
 the


day."
 And
 uh
 Tota,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 It's
 our
 birthday
 month.


Let's
 celebrate.
 Dude,
 we
 got
 12
 more


days
 until
 your
 boy
 is
 28
 years
 old.


So,
 we
 are
 quickly
 ramping
 up
 the
 uh
 the


dial
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 age.
 All right,


word
 of
 the
 day.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.
 What


do
 we
 got?


What
 the
 heck
 is
 this,
 dude?


Magischool.


Magischool.


I'm
 going
 with
 Magis
 School.


Majestule.


Okay,
 that's
 not
 my
 fault.
 I'm
 not
 even


going
 to
 apologize,
 but
 that's
 not
 my


fault.
 Majescu.
 Large
 or
 capital


letters.


Dude,
 who
 has
 ever
 used
 that
 word
 before


to
 describe
 capital
 letters?
 Majescal.


Wow,
 the
 letters
 are
 very
 majestical.


What?
 Like,
 who's
 ever
 who's
 ever


freaking
 used
 that
 word?


Large
 or
 capital?
 A
 large
 letter


literally
 sounds
 for
 capital
 letters.


I
 use
 that
 word
 every
 day.
 All right,


for
 sure.
 Uh,
 sometimes
 says,
 "It's
 my


birthday
 today."
 Happy
 birthday
 to
 you.


We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 October
 babies
 in
 the


chat.
 Tons
 of
 October
 birthday.
 So,


happy
 birthday
 to
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 on
 the
 market
 open
 to
 uh
 to
 help


spend
 your
 or
 help
 celebrate
 your


birthday
 and
 spend
 your
 time
 on
 this


day.
 I'm
 sorry
 for
 the
 uh
 the
 five


minute
 data
 center,
 I
 guess,
 blackout
 we


had.
 I'm
 going
 to
 blame
 it
 on
 data


centers
 in
 New
 Jersey.
 They
 are
 building


a
 ton
 in
 New
 Jersey.
 So
 may
 maybe
 that's


my
 excuse,
 but
 hopefully
 that
 doesn't


happen
 tomorrow.
 But
 we
 got
 to
 do
 the


show.
 We
 got
 to
 keep
 it
 going.
 We
 looked


a
 little
 bleak
 there
 for
 five
 minutes


and
 then
 we
 came
 back.
 So


we
 are
 here.
 All right.
 I'll
 be
 back
 on


the
 market
 close.
 Uh
 today
 we
 will
 have


United
 earnings.
 So
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at


those
 earnings.
 That's
 going to
 be


really
 important
 for
 the
 health
 of
 the


consumer.
 So
 after
 the
 close
 we'll
 look


at
 United
 and
 then
 tomorrow
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 really
 important
 day
 with
 TSM.
 We


got
 Charles
 Schwab,
 IBKR,
 a
 bunch
 of


other
 banks
 reporting.
 So,
 tomorrow
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 day,
 but
 if
 we
 can


keep
 this
 S&P
 1%
 move,


it's
 a
 decent
 decent
 recovery
 here.
 Even


if
 we
 close
 anywhere
 above
 665,
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 pretty
 bullish
 given
 where


we
 were
 on
 Friday.
 And
 then
 hopefully
 we


can
 get
 back
 up
 to
 that
 670
 level.
 Yeah,


Nebius
 literally
 has
 a
 data
 center
 in


New
 Jersey,
 bro.


I'm
 telling
 you,
 it's
 the
 data
 centers.


They're
 gonna
 they're
 gonna
 One
 day


you're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 something.


Power
 is
 going
 to
 go
 out
 and
 it's
 going


to
 be
 because
 of
 these
 freaking
 data


centers.


All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Let's
 see
 if
 AMD
 can


crack
 through
 this
 240
 as
 well.
 And
 I'll


be
 back
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Uh
 we
 will


have
 one
 more
 show
 on
 Twitter
 again


12:30
 Eastern
 if
 you're
 interested
 in
 a


relatively
 small
 I
 would
 say
 undervalued


energy
 play.
 Uh
 we
 will
 be
 talking
 30


minutes.
 It'll
 be
 a
 quick
 show.
 Audio
 on


X.
 Equity
 edge
 is
 the
 name
 of
 the
 show.


ENS
 is
 the
 ticker.
 I
 don't
 have
 a


position
 in
 this.
 still
 doing
 my
 DD
 but


stock
 talk
 does
 and
 so
 he'll
 be
 giving


us
 some
 DD
 on
 the
 stock
 in
 the
 energy


solutions
 and
 battery
 space.


All right,
 there
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you


guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
