[Music]


hi
 everybody
 today
 we're
 going
 for
 an


exciting
 drive
 with
 the
 CEO
 of
 Porsche


and
 Volkswagen
 olivo
 Bloom
 now
 Porsche


is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 recognized
 brands
 on


the
 planet
 and
 we
 own
 more
 than
 1%
 of


Porsche
 and
 Volkswagen
 when
 Porsche
 got


listed
 in
 2022
 we
 were
 a
 Cornerstone


investor
 so
 we
 are
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 race


together
 here


so
 yeah
 hello
 it's
 a
 great
 pleasure
 to


be
 together
 with
 you
 and
 joining
 your


podcast
 serious
 Nikolai
 so
 um
 OE
 are
 you


are
 you
 a
 petrol
 head
 I
 am
 I
 am
 I'm


working
 in
 the
 automotive
 industry
 since


30
 years
 I'm
 passionate
 for
 cars
 and
 I


love
 it
 to
 drive
 when
 did
 you
 buy
 your


first
 Porche
 I
 buy
 my
 first
 Porsche
 when


I
 started
 at
 Porsche
 um
 almost
 uh
 12


years
 ago
 and
 um
 it
 was
 the
 911
 what's


the
 magic
 week
 911
 I
 mean
 uh
 your
 ticket


code
 on
 the
 so
 exchange
 is
 p911
 you
 have


900
 111
 million
 shares
 in
 issue
 so
 what


what
 is
 it
 with
 this
 number
 yeah
 the


9911
 is
 is
 our
 icon
 our
 first
 edition
 we


launched
 in


1963
 and
 since
 then
 uh
 we
 had
 um


numerous
 um
 successes
 and
 victories
 in


in


Motorsport
 and
 uh
 the
 911
 expresses
 what


what
 Porche
 stands
 for
 it's
 a
 unique


design
 um
 it's
 a
 great
 performance
 uh
 of


the
 car
 and
 it's
 the
 Great
 lifestyle
 of


of
 Porsche
 our
 customers
 love
 M
 so
 you


real
 professional
 petrol
 head
 you


basically
 you
 open
 the
 door
 of
 a
 of
 a


car
 and
 you
 sit
 down
 and
 you
 start
 the


engine
 how
 do
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 good
 car


so
 when
 you
 drive
 you
 start
 to
 drive
 you


know
 second
 third
 fourth
 gear
 uh
 just


how
 how
 do
 you
 know
 that
 you
 love
 this


car
 what
 is
 it
 you're
 looking
 for
 yeah


for
 first
 of
 all
 we
 have
 the
 key
 on
 the


left
 hand
 side
 at
 at
 Porsche
 and
 then
 I


know
 that
 I'm
 at
 home


and
 feeling
 the
 car
 for
 for
 me
 is
 um
 how


is
 the
 drivability
 of
 of
 a
 car
 um
 what


does
 that
 mean
 what
 is
 it
 how
 do
 you


steer
 the
 car
 it
 uh
 if
 it
 handles
 like


like
 a
 go-kart
 um
 with
 a
 direct
 steering


then
 the
 handling
 um
 how
 you're
 taking


the
 curves
 how
 the
 chassis
 um
 is
 is


reacting
 how
 is
 your
 seating
 position


and
 all
 these
 um
 um
 factors
 are
 are


important
 um
 for
 the
 drivability
 of
 of
 a


car
 and
 at
 the
 end
 at
 Porsche
 to
 have
 a


real
 sports
 car
 and
 for
 Porsche
 it
 is


important
 having
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 side


the
 sportiness
 the
 performance
 and
 on


the
 other
 side
 um
 the
 abilities
 as
 a


daily
 driver
 so
 you
 add
 all
 these


together
 this
 kind
 of
 driveability
 what


how
 does
 Porche
 differ
 from
 other
 cars


yeah
 for
 Porche
 it's
 not
 only
 the


acceleration
 um
 for
 us
 um
 is
 um
 putting


into
 the
 car
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 Innovations
 um


coming
 from


Motorsports
 because
 we
 think
 um
 that
 um


the
 RAC
 trck
 is
 the
 hardest
 testing


field
 for
 our
 Innovations
 for
 example


our
 pdk
 um
 the
 braking
 systems
 and
 um


the
 hybrid
 systems
 and
 a
 lot
 of


Innovations
 coming
 coming
 from
 mport
 and


um
 that
 is
 important
 to
 to
 D
 from
 the


competition
 it's
 not
 about
 um


acceleration
 it's
 about
 um
 the
 driving


abilities
 and
 our
 hardest
 measure
 is
 um


the
 um
 time
 we
 are
 achieving
 on
 a


racetrack
 for
 us
 for
 example
 the
 nring


Nord
 Scher
 the
 famous
 one
 in
 in
 Germany


or
 Laguna
 Seer
 and
 um
 there
 we
 know
 um


every
 second
 um
 is
 important
 um
 to
 to


build
 the
 perfect
 sports
 car
 what
 about


the
 brand
 what
 what
 uh
 what
 is
 implied


in
 the
 Porsche
 brand
 the
 brand
 is
 very


important
 as
 as
 Porsche
 we
 were
 able
 to


develop
 a
 iconic
 brand
 during
 um
 the


over
 seven
 decades
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


Heritage
 of
 of
 our
 brand
 uh
 for
 what
 our


brand
 uh
 stands
 for
 the
 um


contradictions
 um
 in
 between
 um


usability
 and
 and
 design
 um
 for
 for


example
 play
 play
 a
 big
 role
 um
 then
 um


the
 Porsche
 culture
 play
 a
 big
 role
 and


at
 the
 end
 the
 iconic
 product
 um
 with
 um


356
 our
 first
 model
 then
 the
 911
 and
 uh


all
 the
 other
 models
 over
 the
 718
 um


Cayenne
 Panamera
 um
 then
 then
 marar
 play


player
 important
 important
 role
 and
 um


this
 combination
 is
 what
 um
 our
 um


customers
 love
 because
 we
 are
 the
 brand


for
 those
 who
 follow
 their
 dreams
 who's


your
 Target
 customer
 we
 haven't
 got
 a
 a


um
 this
 special
 um
 Target
 customer
 um


important
 for
 us
 to
 fulfill
 dreams
 M
 and


um
 what
 kind
 of
 dreams
 that's
 to
 have
 a


have
 a
 fulfill
 a
 life
 dream
 we
 have


people
 um
 they
 stand
 for
 success
 and
 at


the
 end
 to
 fulfill
 their
 own
 dream
 and


um
 so
 uh
 our
 our
 customers
 um
 are
 are


people
 um
 who
 love
 to
 to
 drive
 sporty


cars
 who
 love
 um
 Brands
 and
 um
 at
 the


end
 um
 to
 have
 um
 a
 high
 level
 of


individualization


exclusivity
 and
 um
 so
 um
 our
 customer


profile
 uh
 around
 the
 world
 um
 is
 like


this
 but
 for
 example
 the
 share
 of


diversity
 is
 different
 in
 Asia
 um
 we


have
 a
 share
 of
 50%
 um
 male
 male
 and


female
 um
 in
 the
 western
 world
 it's
 more


8020
 why
 do
 you
 have
 a
 higher
 um


penetration
 in
 uh
 in
 Asia
 in
 terms
 of


email
 drivers
 yeah
 um
 because
 um
 they


love
 the
 luxury
 positioning
 of
 um
 of


Porsche
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 successful


young
 ladies
 um
 in
 Asia
 entrepreneurs


and
 uh
 that
 describes
 um
 the
 customer


profile
 um
 perfectly
 that
 they
 are


hardworking
 and
 um
 they
 are
 aiming
 for


success
 and
 then
 the
 end
 and
 they
 are


spending
 in
 luxury
 goods
 like
 like


Porsche
 um
 loving
 the
 Heritage
 um
 of
 our


iconic
 brand
 and
 on
 the
 other
 side
 the


modern
 techn


well
 I
 mean
 you
 have
 um
 kind
 of
 branched


own
 with
 the
 likes
 of
 Maan
 um
 and
 you


mentioned
 exclusivity
 but
 you
 do
 produce


a
 lot
 of
 cars
 how
 do
 you
 balance


exclusivity
 with
 the
 amount
 of
 cars
 you


sell
 pora
 is
 positioned
 uniquely
 in
 the


automotive
 industry
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 side


we
 are
 a
 luxury
 player
 uh
 by
 um


achieving
 a
 um
 average
 sales
 price
 over


â‚¬


100,000
 on
 the
 other
 side
 we
 have
 the


opportunities
 of
 scale
 um
 we
 uh
 sold


over
 300,000
 units
 um
 last
 last
 year
 and


we
 are
 benefiting
 from
 the
 scale
 effects


in
 between
 our
 brand
 but
 we
 have
 on
 the


other
 side
 also
 the
 opportunity
 to


benefit
 from
 the
 scale
 effects
 in


Volkswagen
 group
 where
 we
 are


collaborating
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 modules


Parts
 um
 purchasing
 volume
 and
 so
 on
 and


uh
 what
 is
 important
 for
 us
 being
 able


on
 the
 other
 side
 to
 offer
 exclusivity


whatever
 our
 customer


um
 um
 ask
 us
 we
 are
 able
 um
 to
 to


implement
 into
 into
 our
 car
 so
 we
 can


say
 that
 no
 Porche
 you
 can
 compare
 with


the
 other
 who
 is
 um
 leaving
 our


production
 line
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 focus


mainly
 on
 Porsche
 today
 but
 you
 are
 also


the
 CEO
 of
 Volkswagen
 and
 so
 just
 remind


us
 what
 is
 there
 in
 the
 Volkswagen
 group


in
 addition
 to
 Porche
 I
 mean
 Volkswagen


of
 course
 but
 what
 El
 yeah
 FKS


Volkswagen
 group
 is
 is
 much
 bigger
 and


FKS
 group
 um
 we
 are
 over


680,000
 people
 working
 there
 and
 pors
 is


a
 company
 with
 with
 40,000
 people
 um


each
 of
 the
 brands
 in
 Volkswagen
 group


um
 are
 different
 and
 for
 us
 is
 important


um
 we
 are
 very
 International
 Group
 um


that
 uh
 we
 have
 the
 culture
 um
 of
 um


each
 each
 brand
 um
 where
 we
 are


positioned
 like
 Lamborghini
 or
 Brentley


we
 have
 the
 Italian
 culture
 the
 English


culture
 for
 Bentley
 for
 example
 then
 we


have
 Audi
 and
 and
 Volkswagen
 in
 in


Germany
 scoda
 in
 in
 Czech
 Republic
 and


um
 the
 big
 difference
 is
 the
 complexity


um
 we
 do
 have
 to
 handle
 in
 in
 Volkswagen


group
 um
 but
 um
 the
 great
 um
 issue
 is


that
 um
 we
 are
 able
 to
 manage
 all
 these


fantastic
 brands
 in
 in
 Volkswagen
 group


and
 uh
 so
 um
 I
 think
 um
 each
 of
 these


Brands
 something
 positive
 uh
 where
 where


can
 you
 learn
 and
 and
 in
 my
 history
 I


were
 able
 to
 to
 work
 at
 Audi
 um
 at


Volkswagen
 and
 um
 at
 sead
 for
 example


and
 in
 each
 brand
 um
 I've
 seen
 very


positiv
 um
 practices
 I
 were
 able
 to


implement
 also
 in
 Porche
 well
 I'm
 a


happy
 driver
 of
 an
 Audi
 so
 that
 kind
 of


Suits
 my
 temperament
 you
 know
 oh
 yeah


happy
 happy
 to
 hear


it
 now
 um
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 value
 of


the
 group
 and
 we
 will
 not
 spend
 much


time
 on
 this
 but
 uh
 it's
 fair
 to
 say


that
 most
 of
 the
 value
 in
 the
 Volkswagen


group
 is
 kind
 of
 tied
 up
 in
 the
 Porsche


brand
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is


telling
 us
 about
 uh
 the
 rest
 of
 the


group
 is
 um
 yeah
 with
 with
 Porsche
 IPO


we
 we
 have
 shown
 the
 value
 of
 the


Porsche
 brand
 and
 we
 were
 able
 to
 to


unleash
 the
 potential
 of
 of
 our
 brand


with
 a
 very
 very
 successful
 IPO
 um
 with


um
 very
 difficult
 um
 circumstances
 at


this
 time
 and
 um
 the
 positive


development
 shows
 um
 what
 potential
 we


do
 have
 in
 in
 Porsche


with
 our
 robust
 um
 Financial
 um
 profile


and
 in
 Volkswagen
 group
 um
 I
 think
 um


there
 is
 still


um
 uh
 a
 lot
 to
 improve
 in
 terms
 of
 um


the
 capital
 market
 value
 and
 uh
 we
 have


shown
 a
 very
 robust
 um
 um
 result
 in


2023
 implemented
 a
 clear
 strategy
 a


clear
 restructuring
 plan
 and
 um
 this


year
 we
 will
 bring
 um
 over
 30
 new


products
 to
 to
 to
 the
 market
 and
 I
 think


uh
 it
 has
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 with
 trust
 um


and
 um
 delivering
 um
 our
 result
 and
 then


there's
 a
 big
 potential
 also
 on
 the


Volkswagen
 group
 stocks
 um
 a
 big
 market


for
 you
 is
 um
 is
 China
 how
 do
 you
 see


the
 Chinese
 market
 now
 yeah
 in
 China
 we


uh
 see
 a
 big
 um
 development
 in
 terms
 of


Innovations
 um
 a
 um
 fantastic
 speed
 and


so
 for
 us
 um
 it
 was
 a
 clear
 I
 um
 in


Porsche
 to
 um
 build
 more
 um
 technology


and
 Innovations
 in
 China
 for
 China
 for


example
 our
 Porsche
 digital
 to
 offer
 our


Chinese
 customers
 the
 Chinese
 um


ecosystem
 um
 especially
 in
 terms
 of
 of


digitalization
 we
 are
 very
 well


positioned
 um
 in
 China
 in
 the
 luxury


segment
 um
 over
 500,000
 rembe
 with
 an


average
 um
 sales
 price
 of
 a
 million
 um


Remi
 this
 is
 a
 segment
 of
 600,000
 units


um
 up
 to
 now
 um
 they're
 um
 only


International
 Brands
 um
 in
 this
 segment


no
 Chinese
 Brands
 we
 think
 with
 our


engine
 positioning
 um
 the
 mix
 of
 IC
 um


plug-in
 hybrids
 and
 uh
 beffs
 we
 are
 well


well
 positioned
 for
 for
 the
 market


there's
 a
 strong
 demand
 but
 what
 is
 very


important
 for
 us
 is
 also
 value
 over


volume
 and
 so
 um
 it's
 especially
 last


year
 we
 reduced
 our
 our
 volume
 not


joining
 um
 the
 discount
 and
 and
 pricing


War
 um
 we
 are
 faced
 in
 in
 China
 and
 that


was
 um
 very
 very
 successfully


maintaining
 um
 our
 luxury
 positioning


there
 what
 about
 the
 electric
 vehicle


Market
 in
 China
 how
 do
 you
 see
 that
 how


do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 see
 competition
 yeah
 a


lot
 of
 um
 new
 um
 competitors
 are


entering
 in
 the
 market
 um
 but
 most
 of


them
 um
 more
 in
 the
 volume
 and
 premium


segment


the
 luxury
 market
 for
 um
 electromobility


isn't
 built
 yet
 um
 we
 have
 shown
 a


market
 share
 over
 30%
 for
 the
 taon
 in


the
 luxury
 um
 electric
 segment
 now
 we


are
 entering
 with
 a
 new
 Maan
 and
 the
 new


tyon
 and
 that's
 a
 big
 opportunity
 for


Porsche
 especially
 build
 this
 luxury


segment
 um
 on
 um
 electrification


important
 is
 that
 you're
 coming
 uh
 with


big
 Innovations
 we
 are
 offering
 now
 um


for
 example
 our
 new
 product
 there
 in
 the


market
 and
 um
 having
 great
 opportunities


to
 build
 the
 market
 when
 you
 drive
 um


the
 comp
 with
 the
 Chinese
 competing
 cars


what
 do
 you
 think
 they
 are
 very
 good
 in


terms
 of
 digitalization
 um
 they
 are
 very


good
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 voice


recognition
 some
 of
 them
 have
 um
 very
 um


good
 Advanced
 um
 autonomous
 driving
 um


abilities
 and
 so
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 Chinese


um
 have
 learned
 uh
 during
 the
 last


decade
 um
 to
 build
 cars
 they
 are


advancing
 very
 fast
 and
 um
 so
 um
 I
 think


we
 don't
 have
 to
 hide
 for
 the


competition
 in
 in
 China
 but
 it's
 worse


um
 to
 have
 a
 look
 on
 um
 Chinese
 car


makers
 and
 um
 that's
 my
 experience
 in
 my


work
 life
 um
 wherever
 you
 are
 you
 can


learn
 um
 something
 and
 uh
 to
 make


yourself
 better
 and
 so
 we
 don't
 fear


competition
 we
 are
 from
 the
 race
 track


and
 competition
 makes
 you
 better
 and
 at


the
 end
 um
 competition
 drives


Innovations
 and
 Innovations
 are
 positive


for
 the
 customer
 absolutely
 you


mentioned
 digitalization
 so
 the
 whole


infotainment
 system
 how
 is
 how
 important


is
 that
 in
 today's
 car
 more
 and
 more


important
 um
 the
 customers
 expecting
 um


their
 digital
 ecosystem
 they
 used
 from


their
 mobile
 phones
 for
 example
 Al
 in


their
 cars
 and
 therefore
 um
 in
 pora
 we


decided
 a
 own
 um
 new
 um
 board
 um
 Resort


um
 driven
 by
 sachat
 Khan
 carrying
 about


all
 the
 car
 it
 issues
 and
 infotainment


is
 one
 important
 um
 offer
 we
 had
 dep


peling
 for
 for
 our
 customers
 and
 there


as
 I
 mentioned
 before
 also
 um
 developing


Solutions
 in
 the
 regions
 of
 the
 world
 um


in
 this
 case
 in
 China
 for
 China
 but
 also


in
 the
 US
 uh
 we
 um
 have
 Partnerships
 and


activities
 to
 provide
 to
 our
 customers


so
 the
 perfect
 um
 infotainment
 system


what
 about
 batteries
 um
 how
 do
 you
 see


the
 Battery
 Technology
 moving
 the


Battery
 Technology
 um
 have
 seen
 a
 big


advancement
 during
 the
 last
 years


especially
 in
 terms
 of
 chemistry
 um


which
 um
 um
 led
 to
 bigger
 ranges
 then


for
 us
 fast
 charging
 play
 play
 Big
 role


Porsche
 was
 the
 first
 Ser
 manufacturer


with
 a
 800
 volt
 system
 which
 brought
 us


to
 charging
 time
 um
 20
 minutes
 from
 10%


to
 to
 80%
 charging
 level
 and
 we
 are


aiming
 for
 a
 even
 more
 improved
 charging


time
 of
 around
 15
 minutes
 uh
 for
 the


upcoming
 cars
 and
 so
 um
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of


potential
 um
 in
 the
 electrification
 and


therefore
 we
 have
 a
 very
 ambitious


Target
 um
 to
 achieve
 by


2030
 80%
 of
 our
 cars
 fully
 fully


electric
 because
 we
 think
 um
 that


electromobility


is
 um
 Superior
 than
 um
 the
 combustion


engine
 cars
 because
 of
 the
 strong


development
 during
 the
 last
 years
 and
 um


the
 um
 still
 Unleashed
 potential
 of


electric
 cars
 at
 the
 same
 time
 you


invest
 in
 E
 fuels
 what
 what
 is
 the
 E


fuel
 we
 think
 decarbonization
 from
 a


global
 approach
 and
 uh
 we
 take
 over


responsibility
 and
 we
 think
 also
 to
 all


the
 um
 combustion
 engine
 um
 cars
 around


the
 world
 but
 also
 chips
 and
 um


aircraft
 um
 synthetic
 fuels
 um
 play
 Play


important
 role
 when
 you're
 able
 to


produce
 them
 in
 regions
 of
 the
 world


where
 um
 renewable
 energies
 are


unlimited
 the
 need
 of
 energy
 is
 higher


comparing
 to
 um
 hybrids
 or
 to
 full


electric
 cars
 but
 when
 you
 produce
 them


there
 um
 there
 isn't
 um
 the
 argument


anymore
 about
 um
 the
 need
 of
 energy
 and


that's
 a
 combination
 um
 of
 hydrogen
 and


CO2
 coming
 um
 by
 air
 capturing
 um
 from


the
 air
 and
 the
 big
 advantage
 of


so-called
 e
 fuels
 is
 that
 the
 transport


is
 very
 very
 easy
 without
 cooling
 or
 um


putting
 them
 under
 pressure
 like
 you


have
 to
 do
 it
 with
 hydrogen
 you
 can
 use


the
 um
 net
 of
 um
 the
 existing
 filling


stations
 you
 can
 mix
 them
 with


traditional
 fuels
 and
 you
 can
 use
 um


existing
 combustion
 engines
 and
 so
 it's


a
 um
 additional
 argument
 for


decarbonization
 especially
 in
 the


transformation
 and
 um
 thinking
 about
 the


regulation
 in
 Europe
 um
 maybe
 20
 um
 35


when
 they
 won't
 um
 release
 any
 more


combustion
 engine
 CS
 you
 will
 have
 the


existing
 car
 still
 on
 the
 road
 and


therefore
 we
 need
 a
 solution
 and


therefore
 in
 addition
 to
 a
 strong


electrification
 strategy
 we
 are


investing
 also
 in
 E
 fuels
 u
 o
 when
 we


last
 met
 you
 were
 super
 excited
 about


the
 the
 launch
 program
 for
 next
 year


tell
 me
 about
 it
 what
 are
 you
 launching


what
 should
 we
 be
 waiting
 for
 here


that's
 that's
 the
 biggest
 launching


program
 um
 in
 the
 history
 of
 of
 Porsche


um
 we
 are
 now
 um
 fully
 in
 the
 market


with
 the
 new
 cayen
 uh
 we
 have
 had


already
 um
 the
 market
 Premier
 for
 um
 the


new
 Panamera
 then
 uh
 the
 new
 Maran
 in


January
 in
 Singapore
 and
 um
 four
 weeks


ago
 we
 were
 able
 to
 launch
 the
 new
 tyan


and
 there
 especially
 the
 tyan
 GT
 for


completely
 new
 model
 lines
 for
 Porsche


and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 we're


expecting
 a
 new
 911
 in
 the
 first
 time
 of


the
 history
 um
 with
 hybrids
 and
 so
 um
 we


are
 renewing
 five
 model
 lines
 of
 Porsche


of
 our
 existing
 th
 and
 um
 that
 is
 a


great
 ambition
 for
 um
 our
 team
 a
 great


challenge
 we
 have
 to
 handle
 this
 year


but
 a
 great
 opportunity
 for
 our


customers
 which
 of
 these
 are
 you
 going


to
 drive
 I'm
 in
 a
 good
 position
 to
 to


test
 all
 of


them
 I
 I
 love
 I
 love
 the
 911
 it's
 good


to
 be
 the
 boss
 huh


yeah
 that's
 a
 great
 Advantage
 um
 the
 911


I
 I
 laugh
 and
 um
 I
 own
 911s
 and
 um


especially
 the
 new
 911
 and
 I
 test
 them


with
 a
 Hybrid
 engine
 and
 the
 um


tremendous
 acceleration
 and
 still
 having


the
 six-cylinder
 boxer
 in
 the
 rear
 is


fantastic
 um
 and
 today
 I'm
 driving
 a


tyan
 the
 new
 one
 with
 more
 range
 um
 in


wltp
 we
 are
 close
 to
 700
 Kil
 km
 of
 of


range
 um
 fantastic
 charging
 times
 uh


tremendous
 acceleration
 and
 uh
 what
 you


have
 seen
 with
 the
 tyan
 GT
 um
 is
 also
 on


the
 racetrack
 a
 um
 very
 very
 cool
 car


with
 records
 on
 n
 large
 life
 or
 Laguna


sea
 and
 so
 um
 both
 of
 these
 cars
 are


fantastic
 and
 then
 um
 in
 the
 second
 half


of
 the
 year
 will
 come
 the
 Maan
 and
 that


will
 bring
 the
 Maan
 to
 a
 completely
 new


level
 um
 full
 electric
 Maran
 with
 the


offers
 of


infotainment
 um
 char
 navigation
 or


augmented
 um
 head-up
 display
 with
 a
 lot


of
 um
 features
 where
 we
 will
 play
 um
 in


the
 Premier
 League
 sounds
 cool
 now


talking
 about
 the
 Premier
 League
 and


coming
 back
 to
 Motorsport
 what
 what
 are


the
 Innovations
 from
 Motorsport
 that


you're
 integrating
 into
 these
 new
 models


yeah
 Motorsport
 is
 the
 core
 of
 Porsche


we
 are
 counting
 19
 victories
 in
 in
 Lemo


for
 example
 this
 year
 we
 were
 able
 to


win
 the
 24
 Hours
 of
 Daytona
 um
 The


Heritage
 race
 um
 in
 the
 US
 and
 uh
 for
 us


Motorsport
 is
 a
 toughest
 testing
 field


for
 our
 Innovations
 and
 for
 example
 the


new
 hybrid
 for
 um
 the
 911
 is
 a


motorsport
 hybrid
 um
 which
 came
 from
 uh


the
 918
 but
 at
 also
 um
 the
 oil
 cooling


um
 we
 are
 using
 for
 our
 new
 Battery


Systems
 we
 developed
 first
 for
 for


Motorsport
 um
 the
 800
 volt
 system
 is


coming
 from
 the
 Motorsport
 um
 is
 only


three
 example
 what
 we
 are
 doing
 there
 we


will
 continue
 continue
 to
 do
 so
 because


uh
 we
 think
 Motorsport
 is
 a
 core
 of


Porche
 and
 from
 Motorsport
 are
 coming


the
 best
 Innovations
 changing
 um
 t
 a
 bit


uh
 and
 moving
 on
 to
 of
 corpor
 culture


just
 uh
 generally
 speaking
 how
 do
 you


feel
 it
 is
 to
 do
 business
 in
 Germany
 in


Germany
 um
 we
 are
 um
 in
 a
 in
 a
 situation


uh
 where
 we
 are
 looking
 back
 to
 Decades


of
 success
 or
 welfare
 um
 in
 the


community
 and
 um
 that's
 not
 given
 for


for
 the
 future
 it's
 like
 like
 in
 sports


um
 when
 you
 win
 a
 cup
 um
 you
 haven't
 got


um
 the
 Guaranty
 that
 you
 will
 win
 it
 the


next
 year
 and
 so
 um
 that
 is
 um
 the


situation
 in
 Germany
 um
 always
 thinking


about
 um
 to
 to
 fight
 for
 for
 the
 success


in
 in
 the
 country
 and
 so
 we
 have
 um
 some


circumstances
 um
 which
 are
 not
 um
 so
 so


easy
 to
 drive
 the
 business
 in
 terms
 of


um
 Industrial
 regulations
 um
 energy


pricing
 but
 um
 we
 are
 proud
 um
 being
 a


German
 company
 founded
 in
 stutgart
 Sous


and
 we
 produce
 the
 majority
 of
 our
 cars


in
 in
 Germany
 because
 we
 think
 um
 that


German
 quality
 is
 still
 a
 important


brandmark
 um
 especially
 in
 terms
 of
 um


of
 cars
 and
 so
 um
 we
 are
 in
 close
 CCT


also
 um
 to
 the
 German
 government
 to


improve
 um
 the
 the
 industrial
 um


regulations
 and
 then
 um
 we
 think
 we
 have


um
 um
 very
 qualified
 people
 in
 in


Germany
 um
 we
 have
 perfect
 um


engineering


capacities
 and
 um
 so
 um
 Germany


especially
 has
 got
 a
 big
 future
 um
 when


we
 are
 um
 prepared
 and
 and
 able
 to
 um


focus
 on
 our
 strengths
 we
 were
 able
 to


show
 in
 the
 past
 if
 you
 could
 change


three
 things
 with
 um
 uh
 the
 German


industrial
 policy
 what
 would
 it
 be
 first


of
 all
 um
 our
 our
 industry
 um
 is
 driven


by
 speed
 and
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


regulations
 not
 only
 in
 Germany
 and
 in


Europe
 as
 well
 um
 to
 reduce
 regulations


and
 um
 coming
 to


faster
 um
 decision-
 making
 um
 in
 between


um
 politics
 and
 and


Industry
 then
 uh
 what
 we
 can
 um
 change


is
 um
 the
 support
 um
 for
 um
 the
 industry


um
 especially
 when
 when
 you're
 investing


um
 there
 are
 also
 um
 decision
 making
 um


processes
 but
 uh
 but
 also
 um
 subsidies


um
 especially
 when
 you're
 going
 in
 new


technologies
 and
 um
 that
 is
 important
 um


for
 Europe
 and
 for
 Germany
 to
 having
 a


clear
 master
 plan
 on
 which
 um
 new


technologies
 we
 want
 to


focus
 and
 um
 then
 in
 terms
 of
 um


electrom
 Mobility
 I
 think
 it
 is


important
 beside
 of
 the
 new
 products
 and


the
 industry
 is
 bringing
 to
 the
 market


also
 to
 support
 in
 terms
 of
 charging


infrastructure
 in
 terms
 of
 new
 renewable


energies
 and
 these
 three
 um
 points
 um
 I


would
 like
 um
 to
 to
 speed
 up
 and
 and
 to


change
 speed
 technology
 and
 and
 charging


infrastructure
 um
 now
 you
 have
 a
 you


have
 a
 long
 tradition
 in
 Germany
 of
 very


high
 Union
 and
 employee
 engagement
 at
 uh


at
 board
 levels
 and
 so
 on
 just
 what
 are


the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of
 of
 working
 in
 this


way
 yeah
 we
 are
 um
 acting
 as
 a
 as
 a


family
 working
 working
 together
 and
 um


for
 me
 is
 always
 important
 um
 getting
 a


close
 feedback
 um
 also
 from
 from
 the


labor
 side
 and
 um
 we
 are
 driving
 um
 the


companies
 um
 to
 together
 with
 a


entrepreneurial
 spirit
 and
 um
 there
 um


counts
 the
 same
 as
 um
 we
 talked
 about
 um


the
 politics
 um
 we
 we
 shouldn't
 um
 um


increase
 um
 our


regulations
 and
 agreement
 processes
 um


we
 need
 the
 speed
 for
 for
 taking
 taking


decisions
 I've
 have
 um
 very
 positive
 um


experience
 working
 together
 with
 the


worker
 unions
 when
 you
 deal
 fair
 and


deal
 with
 full
 transparency
 you
 can


solve
 um
 every
 every
 problem
 and
 um


that's
 my
 um
 working
 experience
 of
 uh


three
 three
 decades
 and
 that's
 um
 how


I'm
 handling
 um
 the
 process
 um
 together


with
 with
 our
 partners
 now
 you
 are
 CEO


of
 two
 companies
 right
 so
 both
 Porsche


and
 volksvagen
 how
 does
 this
 work
 how
 do


you
 split
 your
 time
 yeah
 for
 me
 it
 was


very
 important
 um
 when
 I
 have
 taken
 the


decision
 also
 take
 take
 over
 the


responsibility
 and
 in
 Volkswagen
 group


to
 drive
 drive
 at
 the
 same
 time
 um


Porsche
 because
 for
 me
 it's
 important
 to


be
 very
 closely
 linked
 to
 technology
 to


processes
 was
 a
 close
 contact
 UM
 to
 the


people
 being
 able
 to
 take
 the
 right


decisions
 um
 on
 the
 Strategic
 group


level
 um
 it
 is
 a
 challenge
 very
 clear
 um


in
 terms
 of
 organization
 but
 when
 you


take
 the
 right
 priorities


um
 it
 works
 and
 and
 now
 I'm
 driving
 this


for
 over
 one
 and
 a
 half
 year
 and
 up
 to


now
 um
 we
 haven't
 got
 a
 conflict
 in


between
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 supportive


driving
 both
 at
 the
 same
 time
 and
 it's


not
 new
 in
 in
 Volkswagen
 group
 that
 a


CEO
 driving
 a
 um
 a
 brand
 like
 fan
 P
 or


Martin
 winter
 corn
 um
 have
 driven
 um


also
 the
 brand
 of
 Volkswagen
 so
 I'm


driving
 Porsche
 and
 Volkswagen
 group
 and


um
 my
 um
 um


feedback
 up
 to
 now
 after
 after
 one
 and
 a


half
 years
 it
 works
 perfectly
 and
 is


supportive
 do
 you
 have
 to
 change
 the
 way


you
 behave
 when
 you
 go
 from
 more
 coment


to
 the
 other
 you
 have
 like
 a
 Porsche
 cap


and
 your
 Porsche
 shoes
 uh
 and
 then
 you


move
 room
 and
 you
 put
 on
 something
 else


or
 yeah
 leading
 leading
 um
 both
 shops
 is


very
 very
 different
 um
 in
 in
 Porsche
 um


I'm
 very
 um
 deeply
 involved
 in
 the


operative
 processes
 and
 Volkswagen
 group


is
 more
 strategic
 um
 there
 I'm
 leading


12
 Brands
 and
 um
 the
 technical
 issues


are
 similar
 but
 um
 on
 the
 end
 I
 have
 uh


Partners
 CEOs
 of
 of
 All
 Brands
 um
 who


are
 responsible
 for
 for
 the
 other
 brands


and
 we
 are
 taking
 more
 um
 decisions
 how


we
 can
 improve
 um
 our
 scale
 effects
 um


in
 between
 the
 brands
 how
 we
 are
 driving


together
 the
 performance
 programs
 and
 um


taking
 strategic
 um
 technology
 decisions


and
 there
 it's
 very
 very
 helpful
 that


I'm
 very
 closely
 linked
 to
 the
 car


business
 and
 uh
 being
 able
 to
 evaluate


Technologies
 and
 taking
 these
 decisions


and
 um
 so
 both
 of
 these
 jobs
 are
 very


different
 one
 is
 more
 operative
 and
 the


other
 one
 is
 more
 strategic
 when
 you
 are


so
 involved
 with
 um
 technicalities
 and


the
 technology
 in
 Porsche
 how
 do
 you


avoid
 becoming
 micromanaging
 the
 whole


thing
 or
 do
 you
 it's
 all
 about
 yeah


that's
 that's
 all
 about
 priorities
 um


I'm
 used
 since
 since
 many
 years
 uh
 to


work
 uh
 with
 a
 so-called
 top
 10
 plan


what
 are
 uh
 the
 most
 important
 um
 topics


to
 solve
 um
 in
 in
 a
 year
 and
 that
 helps


um
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 right
 things
 and
 I


implemented
 this
 systematic
 and
 that's


not
 important
 if
 you're
 talking
 about
 10


points
 Five
 Points
 seven
 points
 you
 need


the
 right
 priorities
 and
 beside
 of
 this


um
 this
 embedded
 um
 in
 a
 longlasting


strategy
 and
 um
 I
 built
 my
 strategy
 um


terms
 of
 10
 years
 and
 and
 so
 I
 have
 a


clear
 Focus
 where
 to
 lead
 the
 company


but
 also
 with
 a
 operative
 program
 um


year
 by
 year
 with
 the
 right
 priorities
 I


know
 that
 you
 are
 skiing
 from
 time
 to


time
 with
 oxun
 swindal
 uh
 my
 fellow


Norwegian
 uh
 guy
 he's
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 best
 skiers
 of
 of
 all
 time
 so
 I


asked
 him
 you
 know
 um
 how
 you
 were
 um


how
 your
 skiing
 was
 he
 is
 good
 but
 he's


almost
 more
 Fearless
 than
 he
 is
 good
 he


goes
 fast
 so
 is
 that
 the
 way
 you
 the


company
 as
 well
 yeah
 I
 I
 love
 it
 to
 to


drive
 fast
 and
 axel
 Axel
 is
 a
 a
 great
 uh


skier
 but
 also
 a
 great
 great
 person
 is


ambassador
 of
 of
 Porsche
 and
 um
 I
 love


it
 to
 be
 together
 with
 with
 him
 uh
 and


hiding
 out
 for
 for
 skiing
 and
 and
 also


on
 the
 racetrack
 he's
 a
 great
 great


racer
 and
 um
 that
 combines
 us
 um
 we
 are


coming
 from
 Sports
 and
 um
 I
 love
 it
 to


to
 drive
 the
 company
 like
 a
 sports
 team


on
 the
 one
 hand
 side
 focused
 on


performance
 on
 speed
 on
 the
 other
 side


on
 on
 team
 spirit
 and
 uh
 to
 working


together
 helping
 each
 other
 winning
 and


losing
 together
 and
 taking
 taking
 the


right


decisions
 uh
 with
 a
 um
 um
 same
 mindset
 I


asked
 him
 whether
 you
 whether
 you
 ski


faster
 than
 a
 Porche
 and
 he
 said


thankfully
 not
 uh
 so
 I
 guess
 that's
 a


good
 news
 but
 um
 you
 he
 totally


right
 how
 do
 you
 um
 remain
 grounded
 uh


kind
 of
 uh
 to
 to
 the
 factory


floor
 when
 you
 have
 such
 important


positions
 I
 yeah
 I
 I
 spent
 spent
 the


most
 time
 in
 my
 professional
 life
 in
 in


production
 and
 um
 so
 I'm
 still
 very


closely
 linked
 um
 to
 um
 especially


people
 people
 in
 production
 and
 uh
 when


when
 I'm
 walking
 around
 in
 in
 the


factory
 um
 there's
 still
 a
 very
 close


contact
 and
 um
 people
 there
 um
 tell
 um


tell
 you
 um
 The
 Honest
 um
 things
 in
 the


truth
 in
 um
 what's
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 in


um
 in
 a
 company
 and
 um
 that
 that's
 very


very
 important
 for
 me
 and
 um
 I
 think
 um


as
 a
 CEO
 of
 a
 company
 it's
 very


important
 to
 be
 touchable
 for
 for
 the


people
 and
 um
 with
 this
 you're
 getting


getting
 the
 right
 feedback
 for
 taking


the
 right
 right
 decisions
 and
 uh
 so
 so


in
 Porche
 um
 we
 are
 um
 we
 like
 it


to
 work
 very
 closely
 um
 with
 with
 the


team
 and
 also
 having
 um
 events
 together


and
 there
 being
 being
 touchable
 and
 um


being
 very
 close
 to
 the
 to
 the
 team
 now


you
 have
 a
 PhD
 in
 mechanic
 and


Engineering
 um
 do
 you
 think
 you
 would


have
 had
 the
 credibility
 with
 your
 uh


with
 your
 colleagues
 if
 you
 didn't
 have


that
 at
 the
 end
 is
 um
 uh
 your
 um
 your


input
 in
 in
 the
 company
 and
 and
 your


impact
 um
 you
 have
 um
 for
 me
 it
 was
 a


good


opportunity
 um
 when
 I
 when
 I
 started


working
 at
 Audi
 doing
 a
 parallel
 a


PhD
 and
 uh
 also
 um
 I
 did
 it
 in
 in
 China


um
 over
 over
 20
 years
 ago
 and
 it
 was
 a


great
 experience
 as
 a
 young
 man
 um
 going


to
 to
 China
 and
 um
 feeling
 the
 um


engineering
 and
 Innovation
 Spirit
 they


started
 in
 these
 times
 um
 with
 electric


vehicles
 where
 nobody
 else
 um
 thought
 in


the
 success
 of
 electric
 vehicles
 and
 so


for
 me
 it
 was
 a
 great
 experience
 working


there
 in
 the
 M
 Automotive
 IND
 Institute


of
 University
 in
 in
 Shanghai
 but
 in


terms
 of
 credibility
 it
 it
 helps
 to
 to


understand
 and
 to
 Deep
 dive
 into
 into


Technologies
 but
 at
 the
 end
 um
 it's
 more


important
 how
 you
 act
 um
 how
 you
 decide


and
 how
 you
 work
 together
 with
 a
 team


how
 much
 do
 you
 work
 a
 day
 around
 uh
 12


12
 hours
 um
 the


depending
 um
 some
 sometimes
 in
 the
 in


the
 evening
 and
 um
 one
 day
 on
 on
 the


weekend
 um
 but
 for
 me
 is
 also
 important


um
 to
 to
 have
 the
 right
 balance
 um
 in


between
 work
 and
 um
 personal
 life
 um
 I


love
 sports
 and
 that's
 also
 important
 um


being
 being
 fit
 and
 um
 having
 the
 the


right
 physics
 to
 being
 able
 to
 to
 drive


um
 the
 company
 and
 in
 addition
 to
 skiing


what
 kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 do
 yeah
 I'm


I'm
 soccer
 used
 to
 play
 soccer
 and
 um


now
 um
 for
 me
 prefer
 to
 to
 run
 to
 jck


and
 um
 then
 um
 mountain
 bike
 biking
 um


is
 my
 favorite
 sport
 and
 sometimes
 I'm


I'm
 going
 to
 play
 tennis
 so
 OE
 we
 got


tens
 of
 um
 thousands
 of
 young
 people
 on


the
 cour
 on
 them
 on
 the
 podcast
 here
 so


if
 you
 were
 to
 give
 them
 an
 advice
 and


that's
 not
 to
 go
 and
 save
 up
 to
 buy
 a


Porsche
 but
 uh
 something
 else
 what
 kind


of
 advice
 you
 you
 give
 them
 yeah
 I'm
 in


the
 situation
 as
 a
 family
 father
 I
 have


two
 two
 daughters
 and
 they
 started
 um


the
 last
 year's
 um
 studies
 at
 University


and
 I
 told
 them
 listen
 to
 your
 heart


what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 and
 when
 you
 love


things
 um
 you
 you're
 passion
 for
 them


and
 at
 the
 end
 they're
 coming
 the
 the


right
 results
 and
 um
 that
 was
 also
 my


spirit
 in
 my
 whole
 career
 and
 that's
 my


advice
 to
 to
 young
 people
 when
 they


start
 a
 career
 for
 me
 it's
 um
 impossible


to
 plan
 a
 career
 and
 um
 always
 Focus


what
 you
 are
 doing
 um
 at
 the
 moment
 and


at
 the
 end
 um
 the
 success
 will
 pay
 off


well
 Ollie
 it
 seems
 like
 you
 have


certainly
 listened
 to
 your
 heart
 and
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 engines
 also
 I
 suspect
 during


the
 years
 but
 uh
 big
 thanks
 for
 being
 on

 good
 luck
 in
 the
 fast
 lane

 you
