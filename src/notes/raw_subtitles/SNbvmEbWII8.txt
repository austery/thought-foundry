Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Good
 afternoon


everybody.
 I'm
 delighted
 to
 be
 here.


Nikolai,
 thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 I
 I


enjoyed
 the
 evening
 last
 night
 and
 and


delighted
 to
 be
 in
 Oslo
 today.
 I've
 been


asked
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 culture


at
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 on
 this
 theme
 of


durability
 of
 an
 enterprise.


Goldman
 Sachs
 has
 been
 around
 for
 156


years
 and
 I
 am
 incredibly
 proud
 to


steward
 that


organization,
 but
 it
 is
 certainly
 clear


to
 to
 me
 and
 to
 the
 leadership
 of


Goldman
 Sachs
 broadly
 that
 it's
 very


unusual
 for
 a
 company
 to
 survive
 for
 156


years.
 There
 aren't
 a
 lot
 of


them.
 The
 culture
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 has


evolved
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 And


as
 I
 think
 about
 how
 to
 articulate
 some


aspects
 of
 it
 that
 might
 help
 you


understand
 how
 we
 think
 about
 it
 at
 the


firm,
 I'm
 reminded
 of
 a
 story
 that


highlighted
 for
 me
 at
 a
 different
 stage


in
 my
 career
 how
 important
 culture
 was


in
 the
 durability
 of
 an


organization.
 I
 was
 promoted
 to
 run


investment
 banking
 in
 2006.


Before
 that
 time,
 I
 did
 not
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 talking
 to
 outside
 investors.


But
 when
 I
 was
 promoted,
 I
 started
 to
 go


see
 investors
 to
 talk
 about
 that


business,
 which
 is
 a
 very
 important


business
 for
 the


firm.
 I
 was
 in
 Boston
 meeting
 with
 a
 big


shareholder
 of
 the
 firm,
 and
 he
 was


drilling
 me
 on
 a
 number
 of
 different


areas
 of
 how
 we
 were
 running
 the


business.
 And
 I
 was
 listening
 very


carefully
 as
 I
 heard,"Well,
 why
 aren't


you
 doing
 this
 and
 you
 should
 be
 doing


this
 and
 why
 aren't
 you
 doing
 that?"
 And


after
 about
 45
 minutes,
 I
 said
 to
 him,


"I
 appreciate
 all
 the
 questions.
 Why
 do


you
 own
 the
 stock?
 Why
 do
 you
 own


Goldman
 Sachs?"
 And
 he
 looked
 at
 me
 and


he
 said,
 "That's
 simple.
 I
 believe
 you


have
 one
 of
 the
 most
 strong,
 enduring,


differentiated
 cultures."
 And
 when
 you


look
 at
 my
 five
 core
 holdings
 in
 my


portfolio,
 they're
 all
 companies
 where
 I


believe
 that
 to
 be
 true
 because
 a
 strong


enduring
 culture
 leads
 to
 better


relative
 performance
 over
 time.
 And
 I


never
 forgot
 that.
 And
 I
 went
 back
 and
 I


thought
 a
 lot
 about
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 differentiate
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 So
 in


the
 few
 minutes
 I
 have
 today,
 I
 wanted


to
 point
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 I


think
 our
 organization
 has
 gotten
 right


over
 the
 years
 that
 have
 made
 a


difference
 for
 us.


First,
 we
 went
 public
 after
 133
 years
 in


19
 99,
 26
 years
 ago.
 The
 leaders
 at
 the


time
 did
 something
 that
 was
 different.


They
 didn't
 just
 go
 public.
 They
 went


public,
 but
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 retain


a
 partnership


structure."
 At
 the
 time,
 everybody
 said,


"Well,
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 anymore.
 You're


no
 longer
 a
 partnership.
 You're
 a
 public


company."
 But
 the
 leaders
 at
 the
 time


said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 value
 this


partnership
 because
 the
 partnership


allows
 us
 to
 live
 to
 and
 collaboratively


support
 the
 values
 of
 the
 firm."
 What


are
 the
 four
 principal
 values
 that


Goldman
 Sachs
 strives
 to
 live
 to
 every


day?
 Client
 service,
 partnership,


integrity,
 and
 excellence.
 And
 there
 was


a
 view
 that
 if
 we
 took
 in
 our


population,
 at
 the
 time
 that
 we
 went


public,
 it
 was
 13,000
 people.
 in
 that


13,000
 people
 and
 we
 identified
 the
 top


one
 one
 and
 a
 half%
 as
 true
 leaders
 to


carry
 the
 firm
 forward.
 If
 we
 could


retain
 that,
 the
 firm
 could
 be
 a


differentiated
 and
 more
 powerful


organization.
 So
 over
 the
 last
 26
 years,


we've
 retained
 a
 partnership.
 It's
 not
 a


pure
 economic
 partnership
 like
 a


traditional
 partnership
 in
 a
 law
 firm
 or


what
 Goldman
 Sachs
 was
 before.
 But
 every


two
 years
 we
 elect
 new
 partners
 and


those
 partners
 which
 are
 approximately


1%
 of
 the
 firm
 lead
 this
 organization


forward.
 We
 take
 it
 very
 seriously.


There's
 a
 collaborative
 nature.
 It's


about
 subjugating
 your
 own
 interest
 for


the
 interest
 of
 the
 whole
 and
 we
 work


hard
 to
 protect
 it
 and
 invest
 in
 it.


What's
 an
 obvious
 way
 to
 see
 the


investment
 that
 goes
 into
 it
 is
 to
 look


at
 the
 process
 we
 use
 to
 select
 those


partners
 every
 two


years.
 There
 would
 be
 lots
 of
 ways
 that


you
 could
 do
 this,
 but
 we've
 developed
 a


process
 that
 really
 goes
 back
 to
 when
 it


was
 a
 true
 partnership.
 We've
 developed


a,
 for
 a
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 term,
 unique


process
 of
 what
 we
 call
 crossruffing.


What
 is
 cross
 roughing?
 We
 organize
 a


group
 of
 partners
 to
 go
 out
 and
 talk
 to


all
 the
 existing
 partners
 of
 who
 they


want
 to
 bring
 up
 into
 the
 partnership.


And
 so
 last
 fall,
 as
 we
 do
 every
 two


years,
 a
 group
 of
 40
 partners
 went
 out


and
 interviewed
 360
 existing
 partners


and
 did
 over
 a,020
 to
 30
 minute


interviews
 to
 basically
 look
 at


approximately
 160
 candidates
 to


ultimately
 choose
 95
 to
 enter
 this


partnership.
 And
 despite
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 a
 public
 company,
 the
 aspirational


nature
 of
 participating
 in
 this


partnership
 remains
 incredibly
 high
 and


the
 effort
 that
 goes
 into
 these


selections
 is
 incredibly
 rigorous.


That's
 an
 investment
 and
 a


representation
 of
 how
 important
 we
 as
 a


firm
 take
 this
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 why
 this
 is
 perpetuated
 for


26
 years
 as
 a
 public
 company.
 I
 can't


think
 of
 another
 public
 firm
 that
 has


something
 that
 looks
 quite
 like
 this,


but
 it
 works
 for
 us
 and
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 invest
 in
 it
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 460
 partners
 that
 we


now
 have
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 wake
 every
 day


feeling
 like
 they
 have
 a
 leadership


ownership
 interest
 in
 doing
 the
 right


thing
 to
 drive
 the
 firm
 forward.


Now,
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 culture
 and
 how


culture
 sustains
 itself,
 one
 of
 the


things
 I've
 learned
 over
 time
 is
 you
 can


never
 take
 it
 for
 granted
 and
 you
 have


to
 constantly
 invest
 and


reinvest.
 The
 pandemic
 was
 a
 very


difficult
 time
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 It
 was
 a


particularly
 difficult
 time
 for


professional
 services
 businesses
 and


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 a
 professional
 services


business.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 our


business
 thrives
 on
 people
 being


together.
 Our
 business
 thrives
 on


apprenticeship.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that's


unique
 about
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 we
 have


47,000
 employees.
 50%
 of
 them
 are
 in


their
 20s.
 The
 culture
 and
 the
 ecosystem


of
 the
 firm
 is
 that
 young
 people
 come
 to


the
 firm
 to
 learn,
 to
 be
 mentored,
 to
 be


groomed.
 A
 small
 slice
 of
 them
 stay
 and


develop
 their
 careers.
 The
 rest
 of
 them


go
 out
 in
 the
 world
 to
 do
 other
 things.


That
 is
 our
 model.
 Pandemic
 very
 tough


on
 that.
 And
 just
 culturally
 our
 firm
 is


one
 of
 constant
 open
 transparent


dialogue,
 collaboration,
 getting


different
 views.
 You
 know,
 of
 course
 on


video
 you
 can
 do
 some
 of
 that,
 but
 it's


not
 the
 same.
 As
 we
 were
 coming
 out
 of


the
 pandemic,
 we
 felt
 that
 the
 culture


of
 the
 firm
 had
 lost
 a
 step.
 And
 so
 a


group
 of
 us
 as
 leaders
 sat
 down
 and


said,
 "How
 can
 we
 reinvest?
 How
 can
 we


reinvigorate?
 How
 can
 we
 take
 an
 action


that
 will
 send
 a
 message
 that
 we're


deeply
 committed
 at
 a
 time
 like
 this
 to


strengthening
 our
 culture?
 So,
 we
 came


up
 with
 a
 program
 that
 we
 called
 the


cultural
 stewards
 program.
 And
 we


decided
 that
 we
 were
 going
 to
 take
 all


the
 partners
 of
 the
 firm.
 We
 were
 going


to
 put
 them
 in
 cohorts
 of
 25
 people.
 And


over
 the
 course
 of
 a
 15-month
 period
 of


time,
 we
 were
 going
 to
 force
 every


cohort
 to
 go
 offsite
 for
 two
 days
 to


talk
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 the


culture,
 their
 responsibility
 in


stewarding
 it,
 and
 what
 were
 the
 actions


that
 they
 could
 take
 to
 reinvigorate
 it


and
 continue
 it.
 And
 so
 over
 a
 15-month


period
 of
 time,
 we
 set
 out
 the
 partners


to
 do
 that.
 And
 I
 made
 a
 commitment
 to


go
 have
 dinner,
 a
 two
 to
 three
 hour


dinner
 with
 every
 single
 one
 of
 those


cohorts
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 did


that
 not
 so
 I
 could
 communicate
 my


strong
 passion
 for
 our
 culture,
 but


rather
 I
 could
 listen
 to
 every
 single


one
 of
 them
 communicate
 to
 me
 as
 the


leader
 of
 the
 firm
 why
 they
 thought
 it


was
 important
 and
 what
 they
 thought


needed
 to
 be
 done
 to
 continue
 to


strengthen
 it
 going
 forward.
 It
 was
 a


difficult
 15
 months
 from
 a
 travel


perspective,
 but
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most


enriching
 things
 I
 personally
 have
 done


during
 my
 seven
 years
 as
 CEO.
 The


learnings
 I
 took
 away,
 but
 the


reinvigoration,
 the
 re-energizing
 of
 our


culture
 permeated
 through
 the


organization
 and
 this
 army
 of
 400


partners
 that
 went
 through
 this
 program


loved
 it.
 and
 they
 went
 out
 as
 an
 army


into
 the
 firm
 to
 the
 other
 45,000


employees
 and
 basically
 took
 on
 their


responsibility
 to
 talk
 about
 and
 support


that
 culture
 and
 invest
 in
 it.
 And
 so
 it


was
 a
 great
 example
 of
 taking
 a


conscious
 effort
 to
 say
 this
 is


important.
 We're
 going
 to
 take
 time
 and


we're
 going
 to
 arm
 our
 leaders
 to
 go
 out


and
 push
 that
 down
 into
 the


organization.
 And
 it
 worked
 incredibly


incredibly
 effectively
 for
 us
 for
 our


organization.
 Another
 important
 part
 of


our
 culture
 that
 we
 have
 to
 live
 with


and
 think
 about
 and
 worry
 about
 every


day
 is
 risk
 management.
 We
 are
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 a
 financial
 institution


and
 we
 do
 have
 a
 1.7
 to$
 1.8
 trillion


balance
 sheet
 and
 we
 are
 a
 risk-taking


business.
 We
 take
 risk,
 we
 respond
 to


risk,
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 risk.


There
 are
 all
 different
 ways
 that


organizations
 try
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 risk


that
 they
 take
 on.
 But
 for
 us,
 the


collaboration,


transparency,
 and
 kind
 of
 intellectual


rigor
 around
 which
 we
 try
 to
 develop
 a


culture
 of
 risk
 management
 in
 every


daily
 interaction
 has
 been
 paramount
 to


trying
 to
 make
 better
 decisions
 rather


than
 bad
 ones
 time
 and
 time
 again.
 Now,


of
 course,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 risk
 business,


you're
 going
 to
 make
 mistakes.
 You're


going
 to
 make
 bad
 decisions.
 The


question
 is,
 when
 you
 make
 a
 mistake,


how
 do
 you
 respond
 to
 it?
 How
 do
 you


create
 a
 culture
 where
 people
 run
 to


problems
 instead
 of
 looking
 to
 point


others
 towards
 problems?
 How
 do
 you


create
 a
 culture
 where
 everybody


believes
 that
 if
 they
 see
 something


that's
 not
 right,
 they
 believe
 it's


their
 inherent
 responsibility
 to
 elevate


it,
 shed
 more
 transparency
 on
 it,
 and


make
 people
 more
 aware
 of
 it.


You
 do
 that
 by
 every
 day
 thinking
 about


those
 things,
 talking
 about
 those


things,
 incentivizing
 those
 things,
 and


rewarding
 those
 things.
 And
 our
 culture


of
 risk
 management
 has
 been
 deeply,


deeply
 important
 to
 our
 firm's
 success


over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 all
 of
 us
 at
 Goldman
 Sachs


are
 humbled
 by
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 we've


been
 around
 for
 156
 years.
 I
 keep
 in
 my


office
 a
 copy
 of
 the
 perspectus
 for
 the


Ford
 IPO
 which
 was
 in
 the
 1950s.
 One
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 keep
 it
 and
 I
 look
 at
 it


periodically
 is
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at


that
 perspectus,
 okay,
 there
 are
 very


few
 companies
 on
 that
 perspectus
 that


still
 exist
 today.
 The
 financial


services
 industry
 is
 filled
 with


companies
 that
 come
 and
 go.
 In
 fact,


even
 more
 recent
 to
 that
 point,
 if
 you


go
 look
 at
 the
 Goldman
 Sachs
 perspectus,


when
 Goldman
 Sachs
 went
 public
 26
 years


ago,
 there
 were
 13
 companies
 on
 the


cover,
 I
 believe
 only
 four
 of
 them
 still


exist
 today,
 one
 being
 Goldman
 Sachs.


So,
 it's
 a
 very
 dynamic
 industry
 and
 at


any
 point
 in
 time,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 the


right
 culture
 of
 risk
 management,
 your


viability
 is
 threatened.
 And
 so,
 that's


why
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 focusing
 on


that.


The
 last
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 touch
 on
 from
 a


cultural
 perspective
 is
 this


foundational
 value
 of
 client


service.
 We
 are
 a
 client
 business.
 Our


business
 rises
 and
 falls
 with
 the


experience
 our
 clients
 have
 when
 they


interact
 with
 the
 firm.
 If
 we
 don't
 wake


up
 every
 day
 trying
 to
 really
 think


about
 how
 we
 can
 enhance
 the
 experience


our
 clients
 have
 with
 us,
 we
 will
 not


strengthen
 and
 grow
 our
 business.


One
 of
 the
 things
 we're
 incredibly
 proud


of
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 lesson
 in


trying
 to


simplify
 messages
 to
 get
 a
 result
 to


incentivize
 a
 result
 is
 a
 program
 that


we
 launched
 on
 October
 1st,


2018,
 my
 first
 day
 as
 CEO
 that
 is
 called


one
 Goldman
 Sachs.


This
 was
 an
 experiment
 that
 in
 the


months
 leading
 up
 to
 this
 leadership


team
 starting
 in
 October


2018,
 we
 said
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 find
 a


way
 to
 really
 improve
 the
 client


experience
 our
 clients
 were
 having
 at


the


firm.
 And
 we
 said
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


was
 happening
 was
 our
 clients
 were


getting
 bigger
 and
 more
 complex
 and
 they


were
 touching
 the
 firm
 in
 lots
 of


different


ways.
 So
 we
 said
 let's
 do
 an
 experiment.


Let's
 take
 the
 30
 largest,
 most


important
 clients
 of
 the
 firm
 and
 let's


put
 them
 in
 a
 pilot
 and
 let's
 call
 that


pilot
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 let's


announce
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 incentivize


the
 organiza
 incentivize
 the


organization
 to
 improve
 the
 experience


of
 those
 30
 clients
 and
 let's
 see
 what


happens.
 Well,
 the
 funny
 thing
 about
 one


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 you
 don't
 really
 need


to
 put
 a
 paragraph
 underneath
 it
 for


everybody
 to
 know
 what
 it
 means.
 It's
 a


very
 simple
 statement.
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


and
 everybody
 had
 their
 own


interpretation
 of
 what
 that
 meant
 and


how
 to
 execute
 on
 it.
 But
 the
 result
 was


extraordinary.
 The
 organization
 kind
 of


got
 behind
 it.
 Everybody
 wanted
 to


participate
 and
 so
 now
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


has
 become
 a
 cultural
 operating
 ethos.


The
 program
 for
 clients
 that
 started


with
 30
 now
 has
 130
 clients
 that
 are
 a


part
 of
 the
 program.
 But
 the
 whole
 firm


inside
 and
 out
 operationally
 with
 all


clients
 whether
 they're
 in
 that
 program


technically
 or
 not
 thinks
 about


delivering
 a
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


coordinate
 experience
 that
 always
 starts


with
 how
 does
 the
 client
 experience
 us


and
 how
 can
 we
 make
 it
 better.
 It's
 been


hugely
 successful
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a


great
 example
 of
 if
 you
 want
 cultural


change,
 create
 a
 message
 that
 everyone


can
 repeat
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 that


everybody
 can
 grab
 on
 to
 and
 where


people
 can
 understand
 clear,
 definable


results.


So
 what
 I've
 tried
 to
 do
 in
 10
 minutes


is
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 examples
 of
 how


passionate
 we
 are
 in
 using
 the
 culture


of
 the
 firm,
 these
 four
 fundamental


values
 to
 protect
 and
 enhance
 our


business.
 I
 think
 it's
 hugely
 important.


I
 think
 without
 that
 focus,
 our
 business


would
 not
 be
 as
 strong
 as
 a
 business
 it


is
 as
 it
 is.
 But
 we
 do
 not
 take
 it
 for


granted
 and
 we
 wake
 up
 every
 day
 knowing


that
 we
 have
 to
 continue
 to
 do
 that
 if


we
 want
 to
 sustain
 Goldman
 Sachs
 for


generations
 ahead.
 Thank
 you
 all
 very


much
 and
 have
 a
 great
 day.
