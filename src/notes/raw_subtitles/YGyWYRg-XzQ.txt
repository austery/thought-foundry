The
 panic
 of


1837.
 Imagine
 building
 a
 nation
 from


scratch.
 America
 in
 the
 early
 1830s
 was


drunk
 on
 possibilities
 and
 drowning
 in


credit.
 After
 President
 Andrew
 Jackson


killed
 the
 second
 bank
 of
 the
 United


States
 in
 1832,
 states
 unleashed
 a


banking
 frenzy,
 printing
 money
 backed
 by


little
 more
 than
 optimism.
 Land
 prices


quadrupled
 and
 cotton
 exports
 boomed


until
 the
 inevitable
 crash
 came
 on
 May


10th,
 1837
 when
 New
 York
 banks
 suspended


specy
 payments,
 refusing
 to
 exchange


paper
 money
 for
 gold
 or
 silver.
 The


financial
 house
 of
 cards
 collapsed


spectacularly.
 Unemployment
 hit
 25%
 in


some
 cities,
 while
 land
 values
 plummeted


75%.


Farmers
 lost
 generations
 of
 family


property.
 Urban
 workers
 crowded
 into


soup
 kitchens.
 And
 the
 nation's
 850


banks
 failed
 at
 an
 alarming
 rate.
 After


nearly
 40%
 of
 American
 businesses
 failed


during
 this
 5-year
 economic
 nightmare,


Congress
 finally
 passed
 the
 Bankruptcy


Act
 of
 1841,
 America's
 first


acknowledgement
 that
 sometimes
 debts


simply
 couldn't
 be
 paid.
 As
 the
 nation


limped
 towards
 recovery,
 few
 could


imagine
 that
 just
 three
 decades
 later,


an
 even
 more
 devastating
 crash
 would


sweep
 across
 not
 just
 America,
 but
 the


entire
 industrialized
 world.
 The
 panic


of
 1873.
 While
 America
 was
 still


absorbing
 the
 devastating
 lessons
 of


1837,
 an
 even
 more
 destructive
 economic


typhoon
 was
 brewing.
 The
 panic
 of
 1873


erupted
 when
 America's
 aggressive


railroad
 expansion,
 consuming
 nearly
 $1


billion
 in
 investment
 capital,
 collapsed


with
 the
 failure
 of
 major
 banking
 house


Jook
 and
 company
 on
 September
 18th,


1873.
 The
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange


suspended
 trading
 for
 an
 unprecedented


10
 days
 while
 89
 railroads
 defaulted
 on


their
 bonds
 and
 over
 18,000
 businesses


closed
 their
 doors
 within
 2
 years.
 This


wasn't
 merely
 an
 American
 disaster.
 It


unleashed
 what
 economists
 would
 later


call
 the
 long
 depression
 lasting
 over
 5


years.
 Farm
 prices
 plummeted
 45%
 driving


thousands
 of
 families
 into
 destitution.


Labor
 unrest
 exploded
 with
 the
 Great


Railroad
 strike
 of
 1877
 where
 federal


troops
 killed
 over
 100
 protesters.


President
 Grant
 demonstrating
 the


economic
 sophistication
 of
 a
 brick


vetoed
 an
 inflation
 bill
 that
 might
 have


provided
 relief,
 insisting
 on


maintaining
 the
 gold
 standard
 despite


widespread
 suffering.
 While
 devastating,


this
 panic
 would
 pale
 in
 comparison
 to


the
 cataclysm
 that
 would
 shake
 the


foundations
 of
 global
 capitalism
 just
 56


years
 later,
 the
 Great
 Depression.
 The


roaring
 20s
 ended
 not
 with
 a
 whimper,


but
 a
 deafening
 crash
 when
 the
 stock


market
 collapsed
 spectacularly
 in


October
 1929,
 erasing
 $30
 billion
 in


value,
 nearly
 twice
 the
 entire
 federal


budget.
 What
 followed
 wasn't
 just
 a


recession,
 but
 the
 Great
 Depression,
 an


economic
 apocalypse
 unmatched
 in


American
 history.
 By
 1933,
 industrial


production
 had
 been
 cut
 in
 half.
 Home


building
 dropped
 by
 80%.
 And


unemployment
 soared
 to
 a
 staggering


25%.
 The
 banking
 system
 imploded
 as


9,000
 banks
 failed,
 taking
 with
 them
 7


billion
 in
 deposits,
 the
 life
 savings
 of


millions
 of
 Americans
 who
 had
 no


government
 insurance
 protection.


Homeless
 encampments
 called
 Hoovervilles


sprouted
 across
 America,
 mocking
 the


president
 who
 insisted
 prosperity
 was


just
 around
 the
 corner.
 The
 Dust
 Bowl


transformed
 America's
 heartland
 into
 a


wasteland,
 sending
 desperate
 okeis
 west


in
 search
 of
 mere
 survival.
 Farm


foreclosures
 reached
 pandemic
 levels,


sometimes
 met
 with
 armed
 farmers


preventing
 auctions.
 Only
 when
 Franklin


Roosevelt
 introduced
 his
 radical
 New


Deal
 would
 America
 begin
 the
 slow
 climb


back
 toward
 economic
 stability.
 But
 even


his
 bold
 programs
 couldn't
 prevent


another
 sharp
 downturn
 in
 1937.
 The
 oil


crisis
 recession
 1973
 to


1975.
 America's
 postwar
 economic
 party


screeched
 to
 a
 halt
 when
 OPEC
 nations


furious
 over
 US
 support
 for
 Israel
 in


the
 Yom
 Kapour
 War
 orchestrated
 an
 oil


embargo
 that
 quadrupled
 petroleum
 prices


virtually
 overnight.
 Gas
 stations


displayed
 sorry
 no
 gas
 signs
 as


Americans
 endured
 hours
 long
 lines
 for


fuel
 that
 had
 jumped
 from
 30
 cents
 to


over
 a
 dollar
 per
 gallon.
 This
 wasn't


just
 an
 inconvenience.
 It
 was
 economic


warfare
 that
 exposed
 America's
 dangerous


dependence
 on
 foreign
 oil.
 The
 stock


market
 lost
 45%
 of
 its
 value
 while


unemployment
 doubled
 to
 9%.
 Perhaps
 most


alarmingly,
 a
 new
 economic
 monster


emerged.
 Stagflation.
 The
 previously


impossible
 combination
 of
 high
 inflation


reaching
 12%
 and
 stagnant
 economic


growth.
 President
 Nixon's
 price
 controls


backfired
 spectacularly,
 creating


shortages
 of
 everything
 from
 toilet


paper
 to
 sugar.
 The
 crisis
 permanently


ended
 America's
 post
 Xiao
 economic


golden
 age,
 shattering
 the
 assumption


that
 prosperity
 would
 continue


uninterrupted.
 Yet,
 even
 this
 painful


recession
 would
 be
 overshadowed
 by
 the


deliberate
 economic
 shock
 therapy


administered
 by
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 just


6
 years
 later.
 The
 early
 1980s
 recession


1981


1982
 America's
 inflation
 nightmare


reached
 its
 terrifying
 peak
 at
 14.8%
 in


1980
 prompting
 newly
 appointed
 Federal


Reserve
 Chairman
 Paul
 Vulkar
 to


administer
 economic
 chemotherapy


deliberately
 inducing
 a
 recession
 to


kill
 inflation.
 His
 weapon
 raising


interest
 rates
 to
 an
 almost
 unimaginable


20%
 making
 mortgages
 unaffordable
 and


crushing
 businesses
 dependent
 on
 credit.


The
 treatment
 worked,
 but
 the
 side


effects
 were
 brutal.
 Unemployment
 soared


to


10.8%.
 Higher
 than
 during
 the
 1970s
 oil


crisis.
 Construction
 and
 manufacturing


sectors
 collapsed
 with
 30%
 of
 Michigan's


auto
 workers
 losing
 their
 jobs.
 Farmers


already
 struggling
 faced
 a
 full-blown


crisis
 as
 equipment
 loans
 became


unpayable
 and
 land
 values
 plummeted.
 The


poverty
 rate
 jumped
 to
 15%,
 the
 highest


since
 the
 1960s.
 President
 Reagan,


despite
 campaigning
 on
 prosperity,
 stood


firmly
 behind
 Vulkar,
 absorbing
 intense


political
 heat
 as
 protesters
 mailed
 keys


to
 homes
 they
 could
 no
 longer
 afford
 to


the
 White
 House.
 When
 the
 recession


finally
 ended
 in
 late
 1982,
 inflation


had
 indeed
 been
 tamed,
 but
 at
 a


tremendous
 social
 cost
 that
 would


reshape
 American
 economic
 policy
 for


decades
 to
 come.
 Yet,
 even
 Vulkar's


harsh
 medicine
 couldn't
 prevent
 what


would
 arrive
 25
 years
 later.
 A
 financial


catastrophe
 so
 severe
 it
 would
 earn
 the


ominous
 name
 the
 Great
 Recession.
 The


Great
 Recession
 2007
 to


2009.
 A
 financial
 tsunami
 began
 as
 a


seemingly
 contained
 housing
 hiccup
 when


subprime
 mortgage
 defaults
 rose


alarmingly
 in


20207.
 Wall
 Street
 had
 transformed
 these


risky
 loans
 into
 supposedly
 safe


securities
 through
 financial
 alchemy


called
 collateralized
 debt
 obligations.


When
 housing
 prices
 stopped
 their


perpetual
 rise,
 the
 entire
 system


imploded


spectacularly.
 Investment
 banking
 giant


Lehman
 Brothers
 collapsed
 in
 September


2008,
 sending
 global
 markets
 into


freefall.
 The
 Dow
 Jones
 plunged
 54%
 from


its
 peak,
 erasing
 $16
 trillion
 in


household
 wealth.
 Unemployment
 doubled


to
 10%
 as
 8.7
 million
 jobs
 vanished.


Foreclosure
 swept
 America
 like
 a
 plague.


Over
 6
 million
 families
 lost
 their


homes.
 Congress
 reluctantly
 approved
 a


$700
 billion
 bailout
 for
 banks


considered
 too
 big
 to
 fail,
 sparking


populist
 rage.
 Federal
 Reserve
 Chairman


Ben
 Bernani
 deployed
 unprecedented


emergency
 measures
 that
 likely
 prevented


a
 complete
 financial
 meltdown.
 The


recovery
 proved
 painfully
 slow,


reshaping
 American
 attitudes
 toward


economic
 opportunity.
 Yet,
 an
 even
 more


unusual
 economic
 catastrophe
 lurked
 just


over
 the
 horizon.
 one
 triggered
 not
 by


financial
 excess
 but
 by
 a
 microscopic


virus,
 the
 global
 financial
 crisis
 2008


to


2009.
 While
 Americans
 suffered
 through


their
 housing
 collapse,
 the
 Great


Recession
 quickly
 revealed
 itself
 as
 a


truly
 global
 catastrophe.
 What
 began
 in


US
 mortgage
 markets
 spread
 like


financial
 contagion
 across
 the
 world


because
 foreign
 banks
 had
 eagerly


purchased
 those
 same
 toxic
 mortgage


securities.
 Iceland's
 three
 largest


banks
 collapsed
 spectacularly
 and
 the


tiny
 nation's
 stock
 market
 lost
 90%
 of


its
 value
 almost
 overnight.
 The
 United


Kingdom
 nationalized
 major
 banks
 like


Royal
 Bank
 of
 Scotland
 after
 injecting


500
 billion
 pounds
 in
 emergency
 support.


European
 unemployment
 hit
 10%
 with
 Spain


and
 Greece
 suffering
 rates
 over
 25%


igniting
 protests
 and
 riots
 across
 the


continent.
 China,
 fearing
 social
 unrest


as
 20
 million
 migrant
 workers
 lost
 jobs,


unleashed
 a
 $586
 billion
 stimulus


package.
 World
 trade
 contracted
 by
 12%.


The
 largest
 drop
 since
 World
 War
 II.
 The


crisis
 exposed
 fundamental
 weaknesses
 in


international
 financial
 regulation
 and


the
 dangers
 of
 increasingly


interconnected
 global
 markets.
 While


central
 banks
 unprecedented
 coordination


prevented
 a
 1930s
 style
 depression,


recovery
 would
 prove
 painfully
 uneven,


setting
 the
 stage
 for
 new
 political
 and


economic
 tensions
 that
 would
 soon


manifest
 in
 the
 explosive
 coid9
 economic


shock,
 the
 pandemic
 recession


2020.
 The
 global
 economy
 screeched
 to
 an


unprecedented
 halt
 in
 early
 2020
 as
 an


invisible
 pathogen
 forced
 governments


worldwide
 to
 prioritize
 public
 health


over
 economic
 activity.
 Street
 scenes


from
 major
 cities
 resembled
 apocalyptic


films.
 Time
 Square
 empty,
 the
 Paris


Metro
 silent,
 Tokyo's
 Shabuya
 crossing


deserted.
 US
 unemployment
 exploded
 from


3.5%
 to
 14.7%
 in
 just
 1
 month
 as
 22


million
 jobs
 evaporated,
 exceeding
 the


total
 job
 losses
 of
 the
 Great
 Recession


in
 mere
 weeks.
 The
 stock
 market
 plunged


34%
 before
 staging
 a
 remarkable
 recovery


fueled
 by
 trillions
 in
 government


stimulus
 and
 central
 bank
 intervention.


Entire
 industries,
 airlines,


restaurants,
 hotels,
 entertainment,


faced
 existential
 crises,
 while
 others


like
 video
 conferencing
 and
 e-commerce


boomed.
 Congress
 approved
 the
 largest


economic
 rescue
 package
 in
 American


history,
 the
 $2.2
 2
 trillion
 CARES
 Act,


including
 unprecedented
 direct
 payments


to
 citizens.
 Unlike
 previous
 recessions,


this
 economic
 shock
 was
 deliberately


self-induced,
 a
 calculated
 sacrifice
 to


save
 lives.
 As
 economies
 cautiously


reopened,
 inflation
 surged
 to
 40-year


highs,
 sparking
 debates
 about
 whether


we'd
 learned
 the
 right
 lessons
 from
 past


economic
 catastrophes.


Only
 time
 will
 tell
 if
 this


unprecedented
 recession
 represents
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 new
 economic
 era
 or


simply
 the
 latest
 chapter
 in


capitalism's
 endless
 boom
 and
 bust


cycle.
