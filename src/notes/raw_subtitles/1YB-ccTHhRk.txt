[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Thursday,
 October
 30th,


8:47
 a.m.


What
 a
 week
 it
 has
 been.
 It's
 hard
 to


even
 believe
 that
 it's
 Thursday
 given


how
 crazy
 this
 week
 has
 been,
 but


yesterday
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


days
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 for
 2025.
 And


we
 have
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 Uh


we've
 got
 big
 tech
 earnings,
 Meta,


Microsoft,
 and
 Google.
 All
 three
 of


these
 companies
 incredibly
 important.


One
 of
 them
 did
 really
 good.
 The
 other


two
 did
 okay.
 One
 of
 them's
 dumping.
 The


other
 one's
 actually
 going
 up.
 The
 other


one's
 flat.
 Meta's
 dumping.
 Google's
 up.


Microsoft's
 flat.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about


it.
 Uh
 we
 got
 the
 Fed
 rate
 cut


yesterday.
 That
 was
 a
 big
 deal.
 We
 got


those
 25
 bips.
 Market
 kind
 of
 didn't


care
 based
 on
 some
 of
 the
 comments
 JPAL


made.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 less
 about
 the


comments
 JPAL
 made.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 more


about
 the
 fact
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was


already
 priced
 in.
 We
 were
 already


trading
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 We're


basically
 already
 still
 at
 alltime
 highs


even
 though
 we
 are
 red
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 And
 uh
 so
 we
 will
 talk


about
 kind
 of
 the
 implications
 of
 that


rate
 cut.
 And
 then
 yesterday
 uh
 last


night
 we
 had
 two
 major
 thing
 happened
 uh


two
 two
 major
 things
 kind
 of
 take
 place


at
 the
 same
 time.
 Number
 one
 is
 you
 had


this
 guy
 hit
 $200
 overnight,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 crazy,
 but
 Palanteer
 has
 a


two-handle
 in
 front
 of
 it
 or
 it
 had
 a


two-handle
 in
 front
 of
 it
 last
 night.


Maybe
 we
 get
 it
 back
 today,
 maybe
 we


don't.
 Uh
 either
 way,
 very
 grateful
 for


Palanteer
 to
 even
 be
 in
 this
 position.


And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were


grateful
 to
 see
 uh
 the
 the
 momentum
 and


potential
 of
 that
 momentum
 last
 night.


And
 then
 number
 two,
 you
 also
 had
 Trump


and
 Xi
 communicate
 on
 the
 deal
 that
 they


supposedly
 make.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 asking
 right
 now,
 wait
 a
 second,
 why


are
 are
 we
 red
 in
 the
 pre-market?
 Like,


what's
 going
 on
 right
 here?
 Have
 Trump


and
 G
 officially
 signed
 a
 deal?
 And
 this


is
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 off
 with


for
 the
 show,
 and
 we'll
 kind
 of
 talk


about
 what's
 going
 on.
 But
 a
 deal
 was


made,
 but
 a
 deal
 was
 not
 officially


signed.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 issue.


aka
 after
 the
 two
 hours
 of
 negotiating,


uh
 it
 was
 about
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 in


this
 private
 military
 room
 in
 South


Korea,
 uh
 Trump
 and
 Xi
 came
 out
 and
 they


didn't
 really
 address
 the
 media.
 They


didn't
 have
 a
 press
 conference.
 They


didn't
 officially
 say
 exactly
 what's


going
 on.
 Trump
 on
 Air
 Force
 One
 then


said
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 things
 for


what
 the
 deal
 would
 entail.
 Bass


clarified
 some
 stuff
 in
 the
 morning
 and


that's
 why
 you're
 getting
 some
 of
 the


red
 momentum
 you're
 seeing
 in
 the


pre-markets
 right
 here.
 I
 genuinely


think
 it's
 because
 the
 market
 doesn't


fully
 believe
 we
 have
 a
 deal
 yet.
 And


you
 know
 S&P
 is
 at
 684.
 It's
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 We
 were
 at
 689
 yesterday.
 Like


this
 is
 not
 some
 horrendous
 red.
 We'll


see
 at
 930
 what
 happens.
 But
 Nvidia
 212


to
 203.
 Palanteer
 200
 to
 197.
 Robin
 Nood


147
 to
 141.
 Tessy
 465
 to
 455.
 I
 mean
 you


definitely
 have
 red
 candles
 across
 the


board.
 One
 of the
 only
 stocks
 that's
 not


really
 red
 is
 Google
 because
 I
 mean
 it


was
 just
 a
 perfect
 quarter
 and
 that's


why
 Google's
 up
 8%
 right
 here.
 But
 it
 it


is
 quite
 fascinating
 how
 the
 market
 is


interpreting
 this
 shiny
 deal.
 Almost


like
 the
 market's
 saying
 we
 are
 not


going
 to
 fall
 prey
 to
 what
 has
 happened


over
 the
 past
 couple
 months
 when
 you


told
 us
 there
 was
 a
 deal
 and
 we're
 going


to
 wait
 until
 it's
 actually
 official.


Even
 if
 even
 though
 Trump
 did
 give
 some


specific
 details
 that
 you
 would
 imagine


had
 to
 be
 negotiated,
 but
 because
 there


is
 no
 official
 statement
 from
 the
 US


embassy,
 no
 official
 statement
 from
 the


Chinese
 foreign
 ministry,
 the
 market's


kind
 of
 just
 like
 we
 don't
 believe
 it.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 we're
 red.


We'll
 talk
 about
 the
 implications
 of


that
 deal,
 but
 that's
 my
 best
 kind
 of


logic
 for
 why
 we're
 red.
 Now,
 why
 is


crypto
 red?
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 Crypto


cryptos
 I
 if
 someone
 else
 can
 explain
 to


me
 why
 these
 two
 assets,
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum,
 cannot
 catch
 a
 bid,
 I
 would


love
 to
 hear.
 Bitcoin
 back
 to
 108.
 It


was
 116
 on
 Monday.
 Back
 to
 108.


Rate
 cut,
 don't
 care.
 China
 cooperation,


don't
 care.
 I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like


something
 deeper
 is
 going
 on
 with


Bitcoin
 and
 in
 crypto,
 but
 we'll
 talk


about
 it
 and
 we'll
 see
 kind
 of
 what's


going
 on.
 Um,
 all right.
 So,
 let's
 get


into
 the
 China
 deal
 and
 we'll
 get
 into


it.
 First
 of
 all,
 real
 quick,
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 Meta,
 but


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Meta?
 The
 the


simple
 thing
 for
 Meta
 right
 here,


actually,
 why
 don't
 we
 start
 with
 Meta?


Let's
 do
 big
 tech
 earnings,
 then
 we'll


do
 China
 because
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 right
 here
 about
 Meta.
 And
 so,


let's
 get
 into
 it.
 And
 again,
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for


those
 who
 stayed
 for
 the
 uh
 nine
 hours


and
 45
 minutes
 yesterday.
 It
 was
 a
 fun


experience.
 My
 mom
 texted
 me.
 She
 was


like,
 "Were
 you
 were
 you
 live
 for
 nine


hours?"
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 it
 was
 it


was
 a
 pretty
 wild
 day."
 My
 dad
 called


me.
 He
 was
 like,
 he
 was
 he
 was
 upset.


He's
 like, "Did
 you
 eat
 anything?"
 Like,


"What's
 going
 why
 are
 you
 live?"
 I
 was


like, "Dad,
 like
 it
 was
 a
 big
 day."
 He's


like, "Did
 you
 eat?"
 I
 was
 like, "Yes,
 I


ate."
 As
 as
 long
 as
 you
 eat,
 Indian


parents
 are
 like, "If
 you
 eat,
 they're


happy.
 That's
 all
 that
 like
 as
 long
 as


you
 eat,
 they're
 okay."
 I
 was
 like,


"Yes,
 I
 ate.
 I
 had
 some
 chicken
 and


broccoli
 on
 the
 street.
 I
 ate."
 But
 uh


yeah,
 no,
 I
 appreciate
 everyone
 who


stayed.
 It
 was
 a
 really
 fun
 day.
 And
 uh


it
 didn't
 even
 feel
 like
 nine
 hours
 to


be honest
 with
 there
 was
 so
 much
 going


on
 that
 it
 kind
 of
 just
 it
 felt
 like
 it


was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 hanging
 out
 with
 your


friends
 for
 nine
 hours.
 So
 it's
 a
 good


time
 and
 thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 We'll
 probably
 do
 it
 again
 in
 the


future
 if
 we
 have
 those
 crazy
 days
 um


where
 we
 have
 to
 cover
 everything
 for


the
 markets.
 All
 right,
 so
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Meta,
 what's
 going
 on
 with


Meta?
 Meta
 basically
 there
 there's
 two


reasons
 why
 Meta's
 down.
 Number
 one
 is


that
 they
 took
 a
 onetime
 $15
 billion
 tax


charge.
 Uh
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 stupid


reason
 for
 Meta
 to
 fall.
 So
 I
 bought
 the


dip
 yesterday.
 So,
 I
 bought
 at
 750,


bought
 five
 shares
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 it.


Say,
 let's
 have
 some
 skin
 in
 the
 game


for
 earnings.
 And
 then
 I
 bought
 a
 little


bit
 more
 at
 around
 684
 when
 it
 dropped


yesterday,
 which
 I
 I
 thought
 was
 a


decent
 price
 given
 that
 it
 rebounded
 all


the
 way
 to
 75.
 Now,
 it's
 back
 to
 672.


So,
 obviously,
 the
 dip
 keeps
 dipping.


And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 in
 the


chat
 from
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about


also
 uh
 bought
 the
 dip.
 There's
 two


reasons.
 The
 six
 this
 basically
 $16


billion
 tax
 charge
 was
 something
 that


the
 street
 was
 annoyed
 with.
 Uh
 I
 don't


know
 why
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


companies
 have
 to
 pay
 their
 taxes.
 So,


it's
 like
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 take
 the
 stock


down
 for
 them
 paying
 their
 taxes,
 but


it's
 not
 like,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 like


they're
 not
 paying
 their
 taxes,
 which


would
 be
 a
 different
 reason
 to
 take
 the


stock
 down.
 So,
 that
 uh
 caused
 an
 EPS


miss.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 EPS
 miss,


um
 the
 stock
 put
 up
 a
 dollar
 six
 a
 share


versus
 660.
 And
 the
 street
 got
 pretty


upset
 about
 that.
 If
 they
 didn't
 have


that
 $16
 billion
 tax
 charge,
 they
 would


have
 beat
 by
 720
 or
 they
 would
 have
 beat


by
 10%
 because
 the
 EPS
 would
 have
 been


about
 725.
 So,
 that
 was
 the
 first
 thing


the
 street
 was
 upset
 about.
 The
 second


thing
 the
 street
 was
 upset
 about
 is
 that


Zucks
 basically
 said
 for
 fiscal
 year


2026,
 yeah,
 diluted
 EPS
 was
 great.
 For


fiscal
 year
 2026,
 they
 are
 spending
 more


aggressively
 on
 capex
 and
 the
 street


really
 didn't
 like
 that.
 And
 I
 am
 a
 bit


confused.
 We
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 analysts


that
 that
 have
 put
 some
 thoughts
 out
 on


beta
 that
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about
 in
 a


second,
 but
 I
 was
 a
 bit
 confused
 by
 that


because
 the
 street
 wants
 them
 to
 spend


more.
 I
 mean,
 Google
 said
 they're
 going


to
 spend
 more
 on
 capex.
 They
 went
 from


85
 billion
 to
 93
 billion.
 Why
 is
 the


street
 not
 upset
 about
 the
 gooks?
 Now


granted,
 Google
 had
 other
 parts
 of
 its


quarter
 that
 were
 really
 good,
 but
 it's


almost
 like
 they're
 punishing
 Meta
 for


spending
 more
 on
 capex
 because
 it's
 like


they
 don't
 believe
 that
 it's
 having
 an


impact
 on
 their
 operating
 metrics.
 But


then
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 operating


metrics,
 revenue
 is
 up
 26%.
 This
 is
 a
 $2


trillion
 company.
 Google's
 not
 growing


at
 26%.
 You
 know,
 Meta
 Meta
 is
 growing


almost
 like
 a
 like
 a
 SAS
 company
 in
 the


early
 days,
 which
 is
 impressive.


Operating
 income
 is
 up
 18%.
 Daily
 active


people
 is
 up
 8%.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 they


keep
 finding
 more
 people
 to
 use
 this


platform.
 Ad
 impressions,
 their
 core


metric
 is
 up
 14%.
 And
 their
 price
 per
 ad


is
 up
 10%.


So,
 you
 know,
 Google
 had
 an
 incredible


quarter,
 but
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 market


is
 thinking
 that
 AI
 is
 having
 a
 bigger


impact
 on
 Google.
 And
 there
 are
 some


metrics
 to
 to
 make
 that
 analysis
 with


Gemini
 usage,
 API
 usage,
 all
 that
 stuff.


So,
 so
 that's
 fair
 and
 Google
 deserves


their
 premium
 uh
 and
 their
 momentum
 that


they're
 getting
 right
 here.
 And
 quite


frankly,
 it
 would
 not
 surprise
 me
 if


they
 break
 300
 in
 the
 in
 the
 market


open.
 But
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 streets


just
 doesn't
 like
 what
 Meta
 is
 doing


with
 AI
 and
 they
 don't
 think
 that
 it's


going
 to
 have
 the
 type
 of
 impact
 that


Google
 is
 getting
 from
 AI.
 Also,
 Meta


doesn't
 have
 a
 cloud
 business.
 And
 you


know,
 Google
 has
 a
 very
 juicy
 cloud


business
 that
 increased
 their
 operating


margins
 from
 17%
 to
 23%.
 Not
 easy
 to
 do


and
 kept
 the
 growth
 rate
 at
 at
 34%.


And
 so,
 and
 so
 maybe
 that's
 the


difference.
 Uh
 my
 overall
 thought
 on


this
 is
 that
 I
 think
 a
 year
 from
 now


we're
 going to
 look
 back
 and
 if
 Meta
 has


any
 meaningful
 impact
 from
 their
 AI


prowess,
 then
 I
 think
 this
 will
 be


something
 that
 people
 look
 back
 and


laugh
 at.
 I
 did
 say
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days
 though
 that
 I
 was
 worried
 about


Meta
 simply
 because
 Zux
 is
 spending
 like


crazy
 and
 the
 street
 could
 get
 upset


about
 that.
 And
 yeah,
 the
 street
 is


upset
 about
 that.
 But
 it's
 not
 like
 him


spending
 like
 crazy
 affected
 the


earnings.
 And
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 and
 this


is
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 typical
 issue
 with


Meta
 on
 on
 the
 on
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 base


surface
 level.
 You're
 like,
 "Oh,
 Zux
 is


spending
 like
 crazy.
 There's
 no
 massive


AI
 moat
 outside
 of
 the
 AI
 increasing
 the


advertising.
 So
 maybe
 the
 street
 gets


upset."
 But
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


numbers,
 the
 the
 numbers
 are
 phenomenal.


Even
 if
 he's
 still
 spending
 like
 crazy,


which
 means
 they're
 able
 to
 stomach
 all


the
 crazy
 spend.
 But
 uh
 but
 but
 but
 this


time
 the
 street
 just
 wasn't
 happy
 about


it.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 maybe
 because
 of


the
 perception
 of
 not
 only
 the
 tax


charge
 they
 took,
 but
 then
 the
 way
 he


answered
 questions
 on
 the
 earnings
 call


that
 just
 made
 them
 feel
 like
 maybe
 he


doesn't
 have
 everything
 together
 in


regards
 to
 an
 AI
 story,
 which
 again,
 I


think
 in
 a
 year
 from
 now,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 stupid.
 Meta
 is
 now
 trading
 at
 21


times
 fiscal
 year
 2026
 earnings.
 We're


talking
 about
 Meta.
 We're
 talking
 about


a
 multi-t
 trillion
 dollar
 company


trading
 at
 21
 time.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think
 it


has
 to
 be
 the
 cheapest
 Mac
 7.
 When
 the


market
 opens,
 we'll
 look
 at
 the


multiples,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 feels


rather
 attractive.
 I
 am
 curious
 to
 see


how
 bad
 they're
 going
 to
 take
 Meta
 down.


EPS
 down
 84%
 is
 not
 good.
 Again,
 their


EPS
 is
 not
 actually
 down
 84%.
 They
 had


to
 pay
 their
 taxes.
 So,
 I
 would
 rather
 a


company
 pay
 their
 taxes
 than
 not
 pay


their
 taxes.
 And
 at
 some
 point,
 you
 have


to
 pay
 it.
 It's
 a
 one-time
 charge.
 You


know,
 that's
 why
 when
 I
 saw
 the
 numbers


originally,
 I
 was
 like,
 this
 can't
 be


real.
 But
 then
 when
 you
 look
 behind
 the


hood
 in
 the
 accounting,
 it's
 like,
 okay,


so
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 their
 taxes.
 So,
 I


don't
 think
 the
 taxes
 the
 tax
 charge
 is


why
 the
 street
 is
 taking
 it
 down
 10%.
 I


think
 there's
 something
 deeper
 here


around
 the
 trust
 around
 Zucks
 and
 AI


because
 the
 street's
 smart
 enough
 to


move
 on
 from
 a
 tax
 charge,
 but


nonetheless,


you're
 seeing
 the
 pain
 that
 you're


getting
 right
 here
 on
 Meta.
 Um,
 so
 let's


read
 some
 of
 the
 analysts
 and
 what
 they


had
 to
 say.
 So,
 uh,
 Bank
 of
 America,


they
 lowered
 their
 price
 target
 from
 900


to
 810.
 Again,
 going
 to
 this
 argument


that
 the
 street
 is
 not
 exactly
 the


happiest,
 but
 they
 still
 have
 a
 buy


target.
 We
 expect
 Meta
 stock
 to
 be


controversial
 giving
 an
 a
 limited
 EPS


growth
 outlook
 in
 a
 year-over-year
 free


cash
 flow
 pressure
 in
 2026.
 However,
 we


see
 Meta
 in
 a
 position
 of
 strength
 with


a
 massive
 user
 network
 and
 the


opportunity
 to
 integrate
 compelling
 AI


products
 over
 the
 next
 few
 years.
 We


believe
 the
 bad
 news
 on
 expenses
 is
 now


mostly
 in
 the
 stock
 while
 product


catalyst
 including
 a
 new
 large
 language


model
 and
 content
 creation
 tools
 can


drive
 upside
 engagement
 and
 revenue
 in


26.
 Also,
 while
 free
 cash
 flow
 will


likely
 decline
 in
 26
 at
 the
 695
 after


hours
 price,
 Meta
 is
 valued
 at
 10.5x


2027
 IBIDA
 and
 19x
 2020
 2027
 core


business
 EPS.
 that
 means
 it
 has
 to
 be


probably
 closer
 to
 17x
 given
 that
 MET
 is


now
 at
 670
 which
 we
 think
 can
 help


support
 the
 stock.
 So
 they
 lowered
 their


price
 target
 but
 they
 also
 think
 that


it's
 cheap
 which
 you
 know
 makes
 sense


and
 the
 cheap
 could
 get
 cheaper.
 So


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see.
 Rosenblat


says
 hey
 uh
 1117
 is
 our
 price
 target.


Meta's
 3Q
 20225
 was
 great.
 The
 guidance


for
 the
 high
 end
 of
 2024%
 year-over-year


growth
 in
 fourth
 quarter
 sales
 is
 3%


above
 estimates.
 So
 they
 beat
 on


guidance.
 Consternation
 postc
 close


comes
 from
 spending.
 Meta
 advised
 of


expectations
 to
 spend
 72
 billion
 on


capex
 up
 from
 66
 billion.
 So
 their


increase
 in
 capex
 to
 absorb
 expenses


this
 year
 of
 118
 billion.
 In
 2026
 capex


spend
 is
 up
 to
 notably
 larger
 that
 was


the
 exact
 word
 Zux
 used
 notably
 in


dollar
 terms
 while
 2026
 expenses
 are
 set


to
 grow
 at
 a
 significantly
 faster
 rate


rate
 but
 we
 net
 it
 out
 and
 still
 end
 up


raising
 IBIDA
 and
 adjusted
 EPS
 estimates


for
 fourth
 quarter
 in
 2026
 driving
 our


price
 target
 up
 3%.
 The
 topline
 ROI
 on


these
 AI
 investments
 appears
 to
 support


the
 spend.
 We
 maintain
 our
 buy
 rating


and
 raise
 our
 price
 to
 3%.
 Which
 is
 an


EV
 of
 20x
 2026
 adjusted
 EVA
 is
 supported


by
 a
 low
 20%
 EVA
 keer
 over
 the
 next
 two


years.
 So
 you
 have
 two
 different


perspectives.
 One
 perspective
 is
 hey


it's
 cheap
 but
 we're
 not
 going to
 give


it
 a
 super
 big
 price
 target
 because


we're
 afraid
 of
 expenses.
 The
 other


argument
 is
 hey
 it's
 cheap
 even
 with
 the


expenses
 we're
 going to
 give
 it
 a
 high


price
 target
 because
 the
 growth
 is
 as


strong
 as
 any
 other
 tech
 company
 that's


out
 there.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 for
 Meta
 674.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 curious
 what
 the
 street's


going
 to
 do
 it.
 It
 would
 not
 surprise
 me


if
 this
 rebounds
 to
 700.
 I
 think
 maybe


max
 pain
 is
 around
 650.
 If
 they
 actually


take
 it
 to
 I
 mean,
 again,
 like
 when
 we


look
 at
 real
 multiples,
 this
 thing
 would


be
 trading
 at
 close
 to
 15
 times
 2026


earnings.
 That's
 not
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that
 like
 that
 that's
 Google
 back
 in


April
 at
 that
 point
 without
 the


liberation
 day.
 So,
 I
 wonder
 what
 we


would
 see
 on
 Meta.
 But,
 nonetheless,


those
 are
 the
 reasons
 why
 I
 think
 you're


seeing
 a
 bit
 of
 pain
 right
 there.
 Uh


Santiago
 says
 it's
 not
 the
 capex
 expense


stuff.
 Zux
 is
 spending
 too
 much
 on
 the


glasses.
 Well,
 that's
 another
 concern.


Zux
 is
 spending
 on
 the
 glasses
 and


Reality
 Labs
 continues
 to
 lose
 money.


So,
 that's
 also
 not
 the
 best
 thing
 in


the
 world
 for
 Meta.
 I'm
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of


the
 glasses.
 I'm
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of


Reality
 Labs,
 the
 metaverse
 thing.
 I


don't know
 why
 he
 keeps
 working
 on
 it.


But
 again,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 numbers,


even
 if
 you
 take
 all
 that
 into


consideration,


Meta
 still
 becomes
 cheap
 if
 they're
 able


to
 put
 up
 this
 earnings
 growth.
 Now,
 if


their
 AI
 is
 not
 able
 to
 do
 anything


other
 than
 advertising,
 which
 has
 been


the
 concern
 I
 think
 a
 lot of
 us
 have


been
 thinking
 about
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks,
 that
 it's
 just
 ads.
 There's
 no


cloud
 provider
 like
 Google,
 Amazon,


Microsoft.
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 do
 have


earnings
 today,
 so
 that's
 going
 to
 be


important.
 There's
 no
 uh
 LLM
 like
 Llama


is
 not
 something
 that
 people
 use.
 Gemini


just
 hit
 650
 million
 monthly
 activives.


There's
 not
 really
 any
 of
 this
 of
 a


consumer
 product
 outside
 of
 Facebook
 and


Instagram
 that
 is
 using
 AI
 on
 a
 daily


basis,
 although
 they
 have
 like
 their


meta
 AI.
 If
 there's
 nothing
 else
 besides


ads,
 then
 it's
 like
 where
 exactly
 is
 all


the
 spend
 going
 to?
 And
 I
 think
 that's


what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 thinking
 about


as
 well.
 When
 everyone
 is
 unemployed
 due


to
 AI,
 people
 will
 finally
 understand


what
 the
 metaverse
 is
 for.
 Yeah,
 maybe.


Maybe
 when
 all
 of
 us
 don't
 have
 a
 job.


That's
 when
 we
 learn
 what
 the
 metaverse


is
 for.
 All
 right,
 Google.
 Let's
 talk


about
 the
 googs.
 First
 of
 all,
 if
 you


own
 googs
 and
 you're
 heavy
 into
 googs,


uh
 you
 got
 to
 give
 yourself
 a
 pat
 on
 the


back.
 I
 mean,
 this
 stock
 did
 take
 a
 bit


of
 hardcore
 conviction
 to
 stick
 through


uh
 in
 the
 months
 basically
 from
 January


till
 call
 it
 August
 until
 it
 finally


started
 making
 a
 move.
 Google
 has


basically
 doubled
 in
 less
 than
 four


months
 for
 a
 company
 that
 is
 now
 worth


almost
 3.5
 trillion.
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 just


incredible
 to
 see.
 So
 what
 did
 Sunder


put
 up?
 Well,
 they're
 doing
 7
 billion


tokens
 per
 minute.
 They
 have
 650
 million


monthly
 activives
 up
 from
 450
 million
 in


uh
 Gemini.
 34%
 year-over-year
 cloud


first
 hundred
 billion
 revenue
 quarter


$155
 billion
 backlog
 and
 $300
 million


paid
 subscriptions
 across
 Google
 One
 and


YouTube.
 I
 mean,
 even
 Elon
 had
 to
 say,


"Nice
 work."
 After
 seeing
 those


earnings,
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 a
 perfect


quarter.
 I
 mean,
 I
 we
 listened
 to
 the


call
 yesterday.
 Call
 was
 incredible.


Sundar
 was
 on
 top
 of
 his
 game.
 Basically


explained
 how
 they
 are
 building
 the


ecosystem
 that
 they're
 building
 and
 how


it's
 starting
 to
 work
 and
 you're
 really


starting
 to
 see
 the
 advertising
 result.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 Sundar


said
 is
 that
 our
 AI
 ROI
 is
 starting
 to


show
 itself
 evident
 in
 our
 earnings
 and


as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 the
 street's


getting
 pretty
 excited
 about
 that
 as


well.
 This
 is
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 on
 a


visual
 basis.
 Gross
 profit
 was
 61


billion.
 Search,
 by
 the
 way,
 up
 12%


year-over-year.
 Search
 is
 not
 slowing


down.
 Or
 actually,
 sorry,
 search
 is
 up


15%
 year-over-year.
 Last
 quarter
 was


12%.
 So,
 it
 actually
 accelerated
 quarter


over
 quarter.
 YouTube's
 at
 10
 billion.


Uh
 Google
 Play
 is
 at
 12.1,
 Google
 Cloud


at
 15.2.
 And
 then
 overall
 net
 profit,


Google,
 basically
 every
 dollar
 that
 came


into
 the
 business,
 35
 cents
 of
 those


dollars
 came
 into
 the
 net
 income.
 35


billion
 in
 profits.
 It's
 incredible.


It's
 absolutely
 incredible.
 Google


deserves
 it.
 I
 think
 this
 one's
 going
 to


300.
 Seems
 pretty
 obvious
 right
 here


that
 it
 has
 a
 shot
 to
 get
 there.
 And
 the


fact
 that
 Google
 Here's
 the
 other
 thing.


The
 fact
 that
 we're
 red
 in
 the


pre-markets
 because
 of
 this
 China
 stuff


that
 we're
 about
 to
 talk
 about
 and


Google's
 green.
 I
 don't
 know if
 Google


can
 hold
 the
 green,
 but
 the
 fact
 that


Google
 is
 going
 the
 opposite
 of
 the


entire
 market
 and
 saying,
 "Nope,
 we
 are


not
 letting
 this
 one
 fall
 away."
 Uh,


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 excitement
 with


how
 the
 tree
 is
 thinking
 about
 it.
 Here


is
 what
 uh
 Goldman
 said.
 They
 raised


their
 price
 target
 to
 330
 and
 they
 said


uh
 Google
 cloud
 was
 the
 highlight
 of
 the


results
 with
 our
 in
 our
 view
 34%
 revenue


growth
 79%
 revenue
 backlog
 growth
 a


change
 of
 2025
 capex
 guidance
 from
 85


billion
 to
 93
 billion
 results
 in
 an


adjustment
 our
 forward
 forecast


management
 was
 not
 ready
 to
 guide
 2026


capex
 capex
 at
 this
 point
 but
 we
 have


adjusted
 our
 capex
 estimate
 to
 122


billion
 is
 what
 they
 think
 Google
 is


going
 to
 spend
 and
 they
 overall
 feel


that
 the
 search
 momentum
 YouTube


momentum
 and
 Google
 cloud
 momentum
 is


enough
 to
 fund
 growth
 investments
 while


still
 producing
 a
 normalized
 upside


upward
 margin
 story
 and
 long-term
 upside


optionality
 inside
 the
 overall
 structure


with
 Whimo
 and
 quantum
 computing.
 You've


also
 got
 Whimo
 and
 Quantum,
 right?


You've
 got
 Whimo
 that
 is
 starting
 to


grow.
 Uh
 Sundar
 said
 it's
 going
 to
 Tokyo


and
 London
 next
 year.
 And
 then
 you
 got


quantum,
 whatever
 that
 could
 turn
 into,


Google's
 making
 progress
 there.
 So,
 you


just
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 elements
 to


Google
 to
 be
 excited
 about.
 And
 I
 mean,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 it's
 something
 people


would
 be
 scared
 of
 selling
 right
 here.


here.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 probably
 going
 to


have
 some
 people
 that
 trim,
 but
 if
 you


got
 Google
 anywhere
 below
 200,
 even


around
 that
 200
 range,
 this
 could
 be
 one


of
 the
 best
 performers
 of
 2026.
 It's
 one


of
 the
 best
 Mac
 7s
 that's
 showing
 the


ROI
 from
 AI.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 it's


continuing
 to
 catch
 a
 bid
 even
 at
 the


levels
 that
 we
 are
 uh
 we
 are
 seeing


right
 now.
 Alibaba's
 dumping.
 Are
 we


getting
 a
 dump
 on
 Baba?
 Baba
 is
 not
 sure


why
 we're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dump


right
 there.
 That's
 down
 about
 3%.
 see


if
 there's
 any
 headline.


But
 you
 do
 have
 Alibaba.
 Some
 of
 these


Chinese
 names
 are
 going
 a
 bit
 red.
 I


mean,
 a
 lot
 of the
 Chinese
 names
 are


also
 probably
 going
 red
 because,
 you


know,
 there's
 not
 an
 official
 deal


signed
 with
 the
 US
 yet.
 We'll
 talk
 about


that
 in
 a
 second.
 But
 there
 you
 go.


That's
 what
 you
 got
 on
 the
 Googs


continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 296.
 And
 they


deserve
 it.
 They
 deserve
 it
 as
 they


absolutely
 crushed.
 All right.


Microsoft,
 last
 one
 we'll
 talk
 about,


then
 we'll
 get into
 China
 and
 all
 the


earnings
 that
 we
 got
 this
 morning.
 Uh


Microsoft
 525,
 that's
 down
 3%.


Microsoft,
 the
 reason
 they're
 down
 is


for
 two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,
 they
 took
 a


$3.1
 billion
 OpenAI
 hit
 uh
 as
 per
 the


restructuring.
 By
 the
 way,
 OpenAI


reported
 last
 night,
 well,
 Reuters


reported
 that
 they're
 trying
 to
 go


public
 in
 2027
 at
 a
 trillion
 dollar


valuation.


So,
 I
 mean,
 that's
 something
 that's


going
 to
 be
 quite
 interesting
 to
 see
 how


the
 how
 that
 plays
 out
 across
 the
 entire


AI
 ecosystem,
 but
 they're
 going to
 be


filing
 in
 26
 2027
 to
 go
 public.


Microsoft
 would
 own
 about
 30%
 of
 that


trillion
 dollar
 IPO.
 So
 that
 is
 bullish


for
 Microsoft,
 but
 they
 did
 take
 a
 $3


billion
 hit
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be


adjusting
 their
 revenue
 estimates
 going


over
 the
 next
 coming
 quarters
 because


OpenAI
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 included


anymore.
 But
 17%
 increase
 in


productivity
 and
 business,
 28%
 in
 cloud,


and
 then
 4%
 in
 personal
 uh
 computing.


The
 other
 reason
 that
 Microsoft
 is
 down


is
 because
 the
 whisper
 number
 on
 Azure


was
 slightly
 higher
 than
 what
 Microsoft


reported
 for
 guidance
 for
 Q4.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 although
 Azure
 grew
 40%
 for
 Q4,


Street
 was
 expecting
 a
 little
 bit


higher,
 they
 came
 a
 little
 bit
 lower.


Microsoft's
 probably
 going
 to
 beat
 that


number
 anyway.
 But
 in
 the
 short
 term,


until
 you
 give
 the
 street
 what
 they


want,
 you
 know,
 they're
 going
 to
 hurt


the
 stock.
 And
 so
 Microsoft
 is
 up
 30%


year
 to
 date.
 We
 saw
 it
 go
 to
 550
 on


that
 opening
 ideal
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 I


think
 this
 one
 is
 absolutely
 a
 nothing


burger.
 This
 one
 is
 way
 more
 of
 a


nothing
 burger
 than
 Meta
 because
 Meta,


you
 know,
 Meta
 had
 to
 take
 that
 tax


charge
 in
 the
 streets,
 not
 really


believing
 their
 AI
 story
 as
 much
 as


Microsoft,
 but
 Microsoft
 did
 get
 hit.


the
 the
 real
 summary
 of
 all
 three
 of


these
 tech
 companies
 is
 that
 they
 put
 up


the
 results
 they
 needed
 to
 put
 up
 to


justify
 the
 S&P
 500
 potentially
 getting


to
 7,000.
 Maybe
 not
 tomorrow,
 maybe
 not


this
 month,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 not
 even


in
 November,
 but
 if
 you're
 talking
 about


an
 S&P
 that
 could
 get
 an
 exact
 a


increased
 multiple
 based
 on
 companies


continuing
 to
 report,
 Meta,
 Microsoft,


and
 Google
 did
 not
 disappoint.
 Maybe


Meta
 disappointed
 a
 bit
 with
 this
 tax


thing,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 past
 that,
 you've


got
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom


line
 consistent
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 other


companies,
 the
 big
 three
 companies
 in


tech
 put
 up
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom
 line,
 which
 is
 very
 important.


And
 now
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 Meta
 is,
 you


know,
 a
 bit
 cheaper
 than
 some
 of
 these


other
 companies
 that
 are
 out
 there.
 But


overall,
 they
 all
 put
 up
 the
 earnings


they
 needed
 to
 do.
 Uh,
 Amazon
 and
 Apple


is
 today,
 correct?
 Amazon
 is
 and
 Apple


is
 today.
 I'll
 be
 live
 in
 the
 market


close.
 We'll
 see
 what
 we
 got
 for
 Amazon


and
 Apple
 and
 we
 will
 cover
 those


results.
 All right,
 earnings
 in
 the


pre-market.
 Let's
 look
 at
 that
 real


quick
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 what


happened
 with
 China
 last
 night.
 So,
 we


had
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 companies.
 Uh,


first
 off,
 Mastercard
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.
 Mastercard
 beat
 by
 2%


and
 then
 they
 beat
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue.
 So,


8.6
 on
 revenue
 and
 438
 versus
 431
 on


EPS.
 EPS
 is
 up
 13%
 year-over-year.
 Um,


and
 revenue
 at
 this
 point
 for
 a
 company


like
 Mastercard,
 another
 payments


infrastructure
 company,
 is
 up
 17%


year-over-year.
 Mastercard
 stock,
 let's


take
 a
 look
 at
 that,
 is
 up
 flat.
 Now,
 a


lot
 of these
 financial
 companies
 have


been
 getting
 hit
 uh
 like
 a
 Fiserve
 based


on
 potentially
 not
 embracing
 the
 new


financial
 revolution
 of
 crypto.
 Uh,


Mastercard
 and
 Visa
 have
 been
 relatively


flat,
 but
 Street's
 not
 giving
 them
 an


added
 premium
 even
 though
 even
 though


they
 are
 beating
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 Then
 you
 had
 Roblox.
 They
 lost


37
 cents
 a
 share
 versus
 51
 cents.
 They


beat
 by
 27%.
 Another
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom.
 Uh
 EPS
 is
 flat


year-over-year.
 Beat
 by
 13%
 on
 revenue.


1.92
 billion
 versus
 1.7.
 Roblox
 has


actually
 had
 a
 good
 year.
 Roblox
 right


now
 down
 7%.
 All right.
 So
 although
 you


had
 a
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 beat,
 looks


like
 something
 in
 guidance
 or
 something


in
 the
 call
 maybe
 not
 going
 the
 best
 and


that's
 why
 the
 street
 took
 them
 down.


Crocs
 consumer
 company
 beat
 by
 24%
 on


EPS.
 Again,
 another
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom.
 292
 versus
 236
 996
 million


versus
 961.
 That's
 a
 beat
 for
 Crocs
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 That
 stock
 is
 up


5%.
 So
 you're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


momentum
 there.
 Uh
 you
 had
 Hershey's,


another
 consumer
 company,
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 23%
 130
 versus
 106


beat
 by
 2%
 on
 revenue
 3.1
 versus
 3.12.


EPS
 is
 down
 40%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue


is
 up
 6%
 year-over-year.
 Hershey's
 which


has
 been
 struggling
 since
 2023.
 Yeah,


basically
 flat
 down
 another
 1.4%
 right


here.
 not
 getting
 too
 much
 excitement.


But
 again,
 I'm
 just
 curious,
 can


companies
 continue
 to
 beat
 at
 the
 level


they're
 beating
 at?
 And
 we're
 seeing


major
 major
 beats
 across
 the
 board.
 One


of
 my
 favorite
 companies,
 Estee
 Lau,


dude,
 beat
 by
 78%.


32
 cents
 versus
 18
 cents
 expected.
 Then


3.4
 versus
 3.1
 3.38
 billion
 beat
 by
 2%.


EPS
 is
 up
 130%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue


is
 up
 3%
 year-over-year.


And
 you're
 getting
 Estee
 Lor
 shares
 to


go
 up
 2%.
 I
 don't
 think
 Michael
 Bur


still
 owns
 this.
 He
 was
 long
 this.
 I


think
 he's
 not
 in
 this
 anymore,
 but


um
 this
 one
 still
 continues
 to
 execute.


Big
 Pharma,
 Eli
 Liy
 top
 and
 the
 bottom


beat
 19%
 702
 versus
 589
 on
 the
 bottom


line,
 10%
 on
 the
 top
 line,
 17.6
 versus


16.0.
 EPS
 is
 up
 500%
 year-over-year.


Revenue
 is
 up
 54%
 year-over-year.
 I
 mean


quite
 literally
 tech
 company
 types
 of


numbers.
 Eli
 Liy
 right
 there
 up
 3.74%


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Then
 you
 had
 Merc


more
 big
 pharma
 up
 10%
 EPS
 or
 a
 beat
 by


10%
 258
 versus
 235
 17.72
 versus
 16.98


billion.
 EPS
 is
 up
 60%
 year-over-year.


Revenues
 up
 4%
 year-over-year.
 Again,


another
 company
 that
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom.
 Mercy
 here
 is
 down
 2.4%.
 I


think
 what
 we're
 seeing
 across
 the


entire
 market
 are
 these
 margin


efficiencies
 that
 are
 causing
 these
 EPS


or
 just
 overall
 better
 operating


structure
 from
 a
 lot
 of these
 companies


that
 need
 to
 continue
 inching
 out
 a


profit.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 hard
 to
 see
 almost


80%
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 beat
 on
 earnings
 and


say
 there's
 a
 massive
 structural
 problem


in
 the
 economy.
 And
 maybe
 there
 still


is.
 We've
 got
 this
 labor
 market
 that,


you
 know,
 continues
 to
 potentially


weaken
 based
 on
 layoffs,
 but
 it
 doesn't


feel
 uh
 like
 demand
 is
 the
 biggest
 issue


given
 these
 companies
 are
 beating.
 Then


you
 had
 Bristol
 Meyer
 Squib
 163
 versus


152.
 They
 beat
 by
 7%.
 12.2
 billion


versus
 11.8
 billion
 beat
 by
 4%.
 Again,


another
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.


And
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 up.
 Bristo


Miles
 is
 up
 1.4%.
 I
 don't
 think
 Mardo


Libre
 had
 earnings
 today.
 I
 think
 they


had
 earnings
 a
 couple
 days
 ago,
 right?


Ricardo
 Libre,
 I
 don't
 think
 had


earnings
 today.


Um,


did
 they
 Was
 this
 yesterday?
 Was
 this


last
 night?


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 This
 was
 last
 night.
 Okay.
 So,


Mart
 Libé,
 uh,
 they
 also
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.
 Beat
 revenue
 by
 2.8%.


Beat
 GMV
 by
 1.9%.
 Oh,
 they
 missed
 EPS.


Okay.
 So,
 they
 beat
 revenue.
 They
 missed


EPS
 by
 a
 dollar.
 That's
 why
 that
 stock


is
 relatively
 flat.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right


here,
 their
 revenue
 growth
 by
 country.


Brazil's
 up
 38%,
 Mexico
 44,
 Argentina


40%,
 others
 are
 39%.
 Did
 not
 go
 that


deep
 into
 their
 quarter.
 Stocks


basically
 flat
 right
 here
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Yesterday
 after
 hours,
 the


stock
 is
 also
 flat.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it's


down
 1.1.
 The
 Brazil
 tariffs
 affected


them
 more
 last
 week
 when
 Trump
 announced


it.
 That
 has
 been
 relatively
 resolved


with
 the
 election
 of
 Malay,
 but
 you
 do


have
 a


move
 uh
 on
 a
 bead
 for
 revenue,
 but
 a


miss
 for
 EPS


and
 that's
 what
 you
 got.


Yeah,
 last
 night.
 It
 was
 last
 night.
 The


other
 company
 that
 we
 should
 talk
 about


that
 had
 earnings
 last
 night
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 into
 this
 China
 stuff
 is


Chipotle.
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on


with
 Chipotle,
 but
 it's
 down
 18%.
 We


listened
 to
 the
 CEO
 a
 little
 bit
 and


basically
 he
 said
 that
 um
 the
 consumer


that
 makes
 less
 than
 $100,000
 is
 not


showing
 up
 to
 our
 store.
 Ages
 25
 to
 34,


income
 of
 100,000
 or
 less,
 they
 are
 not


uh
 the
 foot
 traffic
 of
 how
 they're


showing
 up
 to
 the
 store
 is
 significantly


lower
 than
 what
 they
 expected.
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 how
 they've
 calculated
 uh


this
 stuff.
 I
 guess
 they
 have
 their
 own


proprietary
 ways
 of
 finding
 this
 data,


but
 uh
 they
 missed
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue.
 EPS


came
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.
 It
 just


wasn't
 what
 the
 street
 expected.
 The


stock
 has
 already
 been
 having
 a
 horrible


year.
 Now
 it's
 down
 45%.
 One
 could
 argue


people
 just
 don't
 like
 Chipotle
 food


anymore.
 Uh
 McDonald's
 did
 say
 the
 same


thing.
 So
 it's
 something
 we
 have
 to
 keep


track
 of.
 Are
 these
 consumer
 companies


that
 are
 catering
 towards
 people
 in
 that


100,000
 or
 less
 income
 bracket?
 Are
 they


not
 seeing
 the
 type
 of
 foot
 traffic


because
 there's
 a
 demand
 issue
 and
 like


people
 can't
 afford
 to
 eat
 Chipotle,


McDonald's,
 etc.
 Or
 does
 the
 food
 just


suck?


Chipotle
 is
 not
 giving
 me
 enough


chicken.


I
 maybe
 that's
 it,
 dude.
 Maybe
 that's


it.
 But
 yeah,
 credit
 card
 data.
 That's


another
 way
 that
 they
 find
 this
 stuff.


The
 CEO
 left
 CMG.
 That
 was
 also
 true.
 He


went
 to
 Starbucks
 and
 this
 new
 CEO
 is


not
 really
 getting
 people
 that
 excited.


I
 don't
 know,
 d
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 hate


Chipotle.
 I
 think
 I
 had
 Chipotle
 last


month.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 It
 is
 a
 bit


more
 expensive
 than
 I
 thought
 it
 was.
 I


mean,
 so
 it's
 like
 Yes.
 the
 it's
 almost


like
 a
 Starbucks
 issue
 where
 it's
 like


are
 you
 really
 going
 to
 pay
 that
 much


for
 a
 burrito?
 But
 maybe
 there's


something
 more
 structure
 going
 on.
 So


that's
 one
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 look
 out


for.
 But
 that
 one
 had
 the
 worst
 earnings


yesterday.
 Big
 tech
 companies
 and
 the


companies
 that
 reported
 today
 obviously


had
 a
 much
 better
 earnings.


Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about
 China.
 Let's
 talk


about
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 confused
 about
 why
 we're
 red


right
 now
 after
 the
 uh
 supposed
 deal


that
 we
 got
 with
 China,
 but
 let's
 uh


let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 kind


of
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 here.
 So,
 this


is
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


clips
 that
 I
 want
 to
 play
 and
 then
 we'll


talk
 more
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 this
 specific
 deal.


So,
 first
 of
 all,
 this
 was
 Trump
 and
 uh


Xi
 meeting
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 I


actually
 fell
 asleep
 and
 then
 I
 woke
 up


and
 I
 I
 woke
 up
 to
 this
 clip
 last
 night.


But
 this
 was
 uh
 this
 was
 them
 meeting


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 about
 four
 years.


>> Mr.
 President
 the
 president
 of
 the


People's
 Free
 Public


to
 see
 you
 again.


>> Good
 to
 see
 you
 again.


>> Me,
 too.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 very


successful
 meeting.
 I
 have
 no
 doubt.


>> But
 he's
 a
 very
 tough
 negotiator.
 That's


not
 good.


all.


>> We
 know
 each
 other
 well,


>> Mr.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 that
 was
 the
 first
 uh


that
 was
 the
 first
 meeting
 between
 them


for
 the
 first
 time
 and
 yeah,
 the


handshake
 was
 strong,
 but
 it's
 not,
 you


know,
 people
 were
 observing
 the
 body


language
 and
 they
 were
 like
 Trump
 didn't


like
 legit
 pull
 him
 into
 uh
 you
 know,


Trump
 usually
 pulls
 somebody
 into
 when


you're
 doing
 the
 the
 handshake,
 so
 it


wasn't
 as
 aggressive,
 which
 people
 were


saying
 was
 a
 sign
 of
 like
 respect
 or


whatever.
 But
 the
 meeting
 seemed
 like
 it


started
 to
 go
 well
 at least
 by
 that


initial
 uh
 introduction.
 And
 then
 this


was
 Trump
 on
 Air
 Force
 One
 basically


talking
 about
 the
 meeting
 afterwards


even
 though
 they
 didn't
 have
 a
 press


conference


>> much
 left
 out
 there
 and
 we've
 come
 to


conclusion
 on
 many
 very
 important
 points


and
 we'll
 be
 handing
 that
 to
 you
 in
 a


little
 while.
 You
 know
 we're
 having


because
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 many
 of
 them
 very


important.


We're
 uh
 we're
 in
 agreement


on


so
 many
 elements
 uh
 large
 amounts


tremendous
 amounts
 of
 the
 soybeans
 and


other
 farm
 products
 are
 going
 to
 be


purchased
 immediately
 starting


immediately.
 If
 you
 notice,
 uh,


President
 X
 authorized
 yesterday
 for


China
 to
 start,
 did
 you
 know
 that,


right?
 China
 to
 start
 buying
 in
 very


large
 quantities
 of
 soybeans
 and
 other


things
 which
 I
 appreciated.
 That
 was
 a


very
 nice
 gesture.


Uh,
 and
 uh,
 many
 other
 things
 like
 that.


We
 on
 fentinol,


we
 agreed
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 work
 very


hard
 to
 stop
 the
 flow.
 You
 know,
 it's
 a


very
 complex
 subject
 because
 it's
 used


for
 lots
 of
 different
 reasons,
 including


including
 anesthetics
 and
 things,
 but


he's
 going
 to
 work
 very
 hard
 on
 it,


precursors,
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 you're
 going


to
 see
 some
 real
 action
 taken.
 I've


agreed.


>> So,
 what
 were
 the
 summary
 of
 what
 or


what
 was
 the
 summary
 of
 what
 Trump
 said?


Uh
 if
 we
 look
 at
 this
 right
 here,
 this


is
 basically
 the
 outcome
 of
 what
 he
 said


on
 the
 on
 the
 Air
 Force
 One.
 The
 US
 and


China
 will
 collaborate
 on
 Ukraine.
 Trump


will
 visit
 China
 in
 April
 of
 2026
 and
 Xi


will
 visit
 the
 US
 soon.
 China
 will
 begin


buying
 soy
 soybeans
 and
 resume
 rare


earth
 exports.
 On
 Nvidia,
 he
 did
 say
 the


US
 and
 China
 will
 continue
 to
 further


discuss
 Nvidia
 chip
 restrictions.
 He


specifically
 said,
 I
 don't
 know
 about


Blackwell,
 but
 we
 will
 still
 discuss


chip
 restrictions.
 Which
 is
 discouraging


if
 you're
 an
 Nvidia
 investor
 because,


you
 know,
 if
 Blackwell
 can't
 be
 shipped,


you
 know,
 the
 Chinese
 probably
 don't


care.
 Uh,
 but
 the
 guidance
 that
 they


gave
 without
 China
 is
 still
 pretty
 good.


So,
 I'm
 less
 optimistic
 we're
 going
 to


get
 China
 revenue
 in
 the
 next
 six


months,
 but
 if
 it
 does
 happen,
 that


would
 be
 nice.
 And
 then
 overall,
 China


tariffs
 are
 going to
 be
 cut
 from
 57%
 to


47%.
 And
 then
 fentinel
 tariffs
 will
 be


slashed
 to
 10%
 and
 China
 is
 going
 to
 be


working
 on
 the
 stop
 of
 the
 spread
 for


for
 China.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 European


Central
 Bank,
 they
 left
 their
 rate
 at


2%.
 They
 did
 not
 cut
 they
 did
 not
 raise


they
 left
 their
 rate
 at
 2%.
 We're


getting
 that
 in
 just
 now.
 This
 is
 after


the
 Bank
 of
 Canada
 and
 the
 United
 States


cut
 rates
 by
 25
 dips
 over
 the
 past
 week.


The
 European
 Central
 Bank
 left
 their


rates
 unchanged.
 So,
 I
 put
 a
 poll
 right


here
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 the
 question
 is,
 do


you
 think
 we
 have
 a
 legit
 deal?
 60%
 of


you
 said
 no,
 40%
 said
 yes.
 I
 want
 to
 say


yes,
 we
 have
 a
 deal
 based
 on
 the


specifics
 of
 what
 Trump
 said
 yesterday.


descent
 also
 this
 morning
 was
 on
 an


interview
 and
 he
 clarified
 a
 lot
 of


those
 specifics
 as
 well
 uh
 in
 the
 in
 the


interview.
 The
 problem
 is
 we
 didn't
 get


any
 joint
 press
 conference
 with
 with


both
 of
 them
 and
 you
 would
 think
 after
 a


deal
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 like
 these
 guys
 can


easily
 just
 go
 on
 a
 plane
 and
 meet
 each


other
 like
 this
 was
 trip
 was
 planned
 for


a
 long
 time.
 You
 would
 think
 after
 the


negotiations
 they
 would
 have
 a
 dual


press
 conference
 and
 have
 a


conversation.
 Maybe
 logistically
 they


felt
 that
 the
 trade
 representatives
 like


Jameson
 Greer
 and
 Bent
 and
 Lee
 from


China
 need
 to
 have
 a
 deeper
 discussion


after
 Trump
 and
 Xi
 met
 in
 person
 and
 it


was
 kind
 of
 a
 formality
 for
 Trump
 to


meet
 Xi
 and
 for
 them
 to
 just
 like


handshake
 agree
 on
 the
 stuff
 and
 then


afterwards
 their
 trade
 representatives


would
 come
 to
 a
 deeper
 technical


conclusion
 on
 what
 the
 specifics
 of
 the


deal
 would
 be
 like.
 Maybe
 that's
 what's


playing
 out
 or
 maybe
 there's
 no
 freaking


deal.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 But
 I
 think
 the


market,
 there's
 two
 reasons
 why
 the


market's
 red
 right
 here.
 Even
 after
 an


amazing
 big
 tech
 earnings
 and
 after
 this


China
 stuff
 is
 number
 one,
 the
 market


doesn't
 think
 there
 is
 a
 legit
 deal.


And
 until
 it's
 signed,
 the
 market's
 not


going
 to
 care.
 And
 then
 number
 two,
 we


were
 at
 all-time
 highs
 yesterday.
 So,
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 pushing
 690
 on


the
 S&P.
 You're
 probably
 going to
 have


some
 people
 take
 profits.
 You're


probably
 going
 to
 have
 alos
 come
 in
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 it's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 get
 to


7,000.
 You
 know,
 you
 need
 to
 go
 through


some
 stuff
 first."
 And
 that's
 probably


why
 we're
 feeling
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 red.


Wow.
 Oh,
 they're
 really
 taking
 Meta
 down


to
 650.
 Dude,
 goodness.


If
 it
 loses
 two
 bucks,
 it
 might
 hit
 the


660s.
 I
 mean,
 that
 is
 incredible.


They're
 taking
 Meta
 down
 this
 much.
 You


know,
 the
 the
 one
 thing
 about
 Meta
 right


here
 to
 think
 about
 versus
 buying
 the


dip.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think
 in
 a
 year


from
 now,
 this
 this
 is
 probably
 not
 a


dip
 that
 is
 uh
 is
 looked
 at
 in
 such
 a


negative
 way
 given
 it's
 now
 trading
 at


20
 times
 2026
 earnings,
 17
 times
 27


2027.
 I
 mean,
 those
 numbers
 just
 feel


incredibly
 cheap
 for
 the
 growth
 that


it's
 putting
 up.
 But
 if
 there
 is
 a


narrative
 overhang
 on
 Meta,
 which
 is


something
 to
 not
 ignore
 because
 we've


seen
 stocks
 that
 get
 a
 stupid
 narrative


overhang,
 which
 might
 not
 be
 that
 stupid


given
 the
 nature
 of
 their
 business,
 do
 a


lingo,
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 kill
 them,


and
 then
 PayPal,
 which
 is
 that
 they're


just
 not
 embracing
 the
 new
 world
 of


finance.
 Uh,
 if
 Meta
 gets
 a
 narrative


overhang,
 I
 mean,
 Google
 had
 a
 nar


overhang
 for
 nine
 months
 that
 the
 DOJ


was
 going
 to
 crush
 them.
 If
 Meta's


narrative
 is
 that
 their
 Zuck
 is
 spending


too
 much,
 I
 mean,
 we
 saw
 what
 happened


back
 in
 2022.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 it


would
 go
 that
 low
 again,
 but
 it
 could
 be


something
 that
 is
 just
 not
 the
 easiest


for
 the
 stock
 to
 recover
 from
 in
 the


short
 term.


But
 that
 is
 something
 to
 watch
 out
 for.


Now,
 there
 were
 some
 people
 that
 bought


lots
 and
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 calls
 on
 Meta


going
 into
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 someone
 had


like
 45
 million
 collectively
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 option
 flow
 of
 815
 and
 830
 calls


for
 this
 week.
 Yeah.
 All
 those
 went
 to


zero.
 And
 unless
 Meta
 somehow
 gets
 to


830
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 week,
 a
 lot
 of


those
 call
 options
 are
 going
 in
 the


gutter.
 So
 if
 you
 bought
 puts
 or
 if
 you


sold
 calls,
 you
 did
 well.
 If
 you
 bought


calls,
 you're
 not
 the
 best.


But
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 meta.
 Yeah,
 a


lot
 of
 the
 price
 targets
 as
 well
 got
 an


increase.
 It's
 just
 straight's
 not
 that


happy
 about
 how
 they're
 ultimately


acting
 right
 here.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 what
 we


got
 on
 Meta.
 SoFi
 is
 down
 a
 little
 bit


right
 now.
 Overall
 pre-markets
 are


getting
 a
 bit
 hit.
 Pounder
 did
 hit
 200


last
 night,
 1968


right
 here.
 Nvidia
 hopefully
 can
 hold


the
 200s
 which
 would
 be
 very
 nice.
 But


20370
 that's
 also
 down
 from
 212.
 Did


Trump
 just
 post?
 Where's
 my
 phone?
 Oh,


there
 it
 is.
 Where
 is
 my
 phone?
 All


right,
 let's
 see.
 Did
 we
 get
 a
 true


social
 post
 on
 Trump?
 Oh,
 here
 we
 go.
 We


got
 a
 post.
 Well,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 from


five
 hours
 ago,
 not
 recent,
 but


basically
 Trump
 said,
 "I
 tr
 I
 had
 a


truly
 great
 meeting
 with
 President
 Xi.


He's
 going
 to
 be
 buying
 more
 soybeans.


China
 has
 agreed
 to
 continue
 the
 flow
 of


rare
 earth,
 critical
 minerals,
 magnets,


etc.
 Very
 significantly,
 China
 strongly


stated
 that
 they
 will
 work
 diligently
 to


stop
 the
 fentinel
 flow.
 After
 this


historic
 trip,
 I
 am
 now
 headed
 back
 to


Washington
 DC.
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 the
 great


countries
 of
 Malaysia,
 Japan,
 and
 South


Korea
 for
 being
 so
 generous.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 Meta
 25
 billion
 bond


sale.
 Is
 that
 a
 headline
 that
 we
 have?


That
 could
 be
 the
 real
 reason
 why
 Meta's


getting
 hit.


Oh,
 yeah.


Oh,
 that
 came
 out
 about
 20
 minutes
 ago.


Oh,
 folks,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 actually
 the


reason
 why
 Meta
 is
 taking
 a
 deeper
 hit.


Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 this.
 Oh,


that
 changes
 the
 story.
 25
 billion
 in


debt
 is
 a
 little
 different.


>> What's
 your
 sense
 of
 how
 much
 more
 some


of
 these
 tech
 giants
 are
 going
 to
 have


to
 tap
 the
 debt
 markets
 to
 fuel
 some
 of


their
 AI
 spend?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 data
 that
 I've
 been


tracking
 really
 closely.
 Meta's
 six
 part


is
 really
 interesting.
 The
 duration


range.


>> Wait,
 hold
 on.
 If
 this
 is
 the
 same
 25


billion
 that
 the
 Black
 Rockck
 ETFs
 are


buying,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 old
 news.
 This


is
 kind
 of
 old
 news.


This
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 25
 billion
 for
 a


data
 center
 buildout
 that
 they
 were
 I'll


try
 to
 get
 an
 update
 on
 this,
 but
 yeah,


this
 might
 not
 be
 the
 newest
 news


nonetheless.
 On
 a
 day
 like
 this
 when


Meta
 doesn't
 have
 the
 best
 earnings,
 it


could
 be
 affecting
 the
 stock
 even
 more.


Let
 me
 see
 if
 this
 is
 new
 or
 old.
 A


couple
 of you
 guys
 saying
 new,
 a
 couple


of you
 guys
 saying
 old.
 Let
 me
 see
 what


I
 can
 find.
 is
 five
 years
 to
 40
 years


which
 like
 at
 one
 time
 and
 Lisa
 you
 know


this
 better
 than
 me
 we'd
 be
 like
 40


years
 what
 that's
 insane
 but
 it's
 not


unprecedented
 even
 in
 this
 part
 portion


of
 the
 year
 if
 you
 remember
 Oracle
 did
 a


40-year
 note
 that
 was
 1.37%


over
 treasuries
 this
 metal
 one
 according


to
 a
 Bloomberg
 source
 is
 1.4%
 4%.
 Um,


but
 it
 it
 speaks
 to
 the
 imminent
 capital


need
 and
 the
 longerterm
 capital
 need.


>> Guys,
 this
 looks
 new.
 This
 looks
 new.


Meta
 is
 doing
 a
 six-part
 bond
 sale


seeking
 to
 raise
 25
 billion
 ranging
 from


5
 to
 40
 years.
 These
 are
 corporate
 bonds


uh
 at
 a
 premium
 of
 1.4%
 above


treasuries.
 Oracle
 was
 1.37%.
 They're


doing
 the
 Oracle
 playbook
 right
 here.


This
 looks
 new.
 This
 is
 from
 Bloomberg


40
 minutes
 ago.
 Meta
 looks
 to
 raise
 at


least
 25
 billion
 from
 its
 bond
 offering.


That
 okay,
 that
 that
 that
 that
 is


actually
 why
 I
 think
 the
 stock
 is


getting
 hit.
 The
 street
 does
 not
 want
 to


see
 capex
 finance
 through
 debt.
 And
 Meta


is
 the
 first
 company
 outside
 of
 Oracle


to
 legitimately


tap
 the
 debt
 markets.
 The
 other
 25


billion
 was
 with
 Black
 Rockck,
 but
 that


was
 for
 Louisiana
 Data
 Center.
 That
 that


actually
 is
 old
 news,
 but
 that
 was


discussed
 like
 two
 months
 ago.
 We
 did


get
 some
 further
 updates
 on
 that,
 but


this
 seems
 like
 a
 fresh
 25
 billion
 of


bonds.


It
 seems
 like
 a
 fresh
 25
 billion
 of
 debt


that
 Meta
 is
 raising.


>> That
 Meta
 has
 and
 you
 know
 the
 story


from
 overnight
 is
 that
 capital


expenditures
 in
 the
 next
 fiscal
 year


2026
 will
 be
 notably
 larger
 than
 they


are
 this
 year
 at
 a
 top
 of
 72
 billion.


That
 that's
 the
 stakes
 we're
 talking


about.
 And


>> do
 you
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 what
 Meta
 is


spending
 on
 given
 the
 fact
 that
 they


don't
 have
 the
 cloud
 that
 say
 the


Microsofts
 or
 the
 Alphabets
 have?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 the
 what
 spooked
 the


market,
 right?
 You
 know,
 Meta
 is
 not
 a


hyperscaler
 and
 the
 way
 to
 look
 at
 it
 is


that
 it's
 aggressive
 investments
 in


capacity
 are
 in
 part
 to
 meet
 internal


demand
 which
 is
 a
 also
 a
 part
 of
 the


evidence
 that
 the
 CFO
 Susan
 Lee
 is


trying
 to
 put
 forward
 that
 they're


seeing
 returns
 straight
 away.
 When
 you


bring
 a
 new
 data
 center
 online
 or
 new


capacity
 online,
 meta
 often
 has
 to
 look


within
 its
 own
 teams
 and
 say
 what's
 the


biggest
 priority
 here.
 um
 that
 is


difficult
 for
 analysts
 to
 model
 how
 it


immediately
 translates
 to
 topline


growth,
 right?
 And
 so
 that's
 the


brinkmanship
 going
 on
 here.
 Meta's
 sort


of
 willingness
 to
 to
 frontload


investment
 is
 how
 Zuckerberg
 put
 it
 and


the
 visibility
 of
 the
 market
 to
 see


revenue
 growth
 that
 would
 justify
 it


near


>> Yeah,
 guys,
 this
 seems
 new.
 This
 seems


new.
 This
 is
 a
 fresh
 new
 bond
 offering.


uh
 their
 new
 total
 to
 debt
 load
 is
 70


billion.
 In
 2021
 they
 had
 14
 I
 mean
 all


these
 big
 tech
 tech
 companies
 have
 debt.


It's
 just
 the
 debt
 is
 you
 know


insignificant
 compared
 to
 their
 free


cash
 flows.
 But
 Meta
 now
 is
 doing
 51


billion
 in
 revenue
 a
 quarter
 roundabout.


So
 call
 it
 200
 billion
 a
 year
 in


revenue.
 Uh
 70
 billion
 in
 debt
 post
 the


bond
 sale
 is
 what
 we're
 looking
 at
 right


here.
 Yeah
 that's
 actually
 that
 I
 mean


that's
 probably
 the
 deeper
 reason
 why


Meta
 is
 red.
 Now
 again,
 the
 same


conversation
 happens
 every
 time
 you
 see


this
 debt
 for
 capex.
 Do
 you
 think


there's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 ROI
 on
 this?


Today,
 I
 think
 the
 street
 feels
 that


there's
 less
 of
 a
 chance
 that
 there
 is


an
 ROI.
 For
 whatever
 reason,
 they
 feel


that
 there's
 less
 of
 a
 chance.
 But


nonetheless,
 if
 there
 is
 an
 ROI,
 whether


it's
 Oracle,
 Meadow,
 whatever
 other


company
 it
 is,
 then
 you
 could
 argue
 that


is
 justified,
 especially
 if
 the
 debt
 is


relatively
 cheap
 compared
 to
 the
 ROI


they're
 going to
 make
 on
 it.


But
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Meta
 is
 uh
 is


getting
 hit.
 Are
 you
 buying
 Chipotle?


No,
 I'm
 not
 buying
 Chipotle.
 I
 I I
 am
 I


do
 want
 to
 look
 at
 their
 numbers.
 I


mean,
 stocks
 down
 50%
 this
 year.
 it


feels
 like
 it's
 worth
 a
 look
 at
 like
 is


there
 any
 value
 here?
 But
 if
 the
 CEO


says
 they're
 not
 getting
 foot
 traffic


from
 people
 that
 are
 making
 100,000
 or


less
 that
 that that
 that's
 more
 of
 a


structural
 problem
 either
 in
 Chipotle's


business
 from
 a
 price
 perspective
 or
 for


a
 consumer
 in
 that
 demographic
 which
 is


Chipotle's
 main
 demographic
 which
 is


still
 a
 bad
 thing
 for
 Chipotle.
 So
 I


would
 not
 be
 like
 easily
 compelled
 to


buy
 the
 dip
 but
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 worth


taking
 a
 look
 at
 Google
 right
 there


29250.
 That
 one's
 still
 green.
 BMR.
 This


one's
 getting
 hit
 because
 Ethereum
 BMR


did
 not
 have
 earnings
 yesterday
 as


people
 thought
 they
 did.
 I
 think
 they


will
 have
 earnings
 next
 week,
 but
 again,


their
 earnings
 really
 doesn't
 matter.


I'm
 quite
 surprised
 that
 that
 many


people
 care
 about
 their
 earnings.
 Like,


I
 have
 a
 position
 in
 the
 stock
 and
 I


don't
 care
 about
 the
 earnings
 because


there's
 nothing
 they
 can
 say.
 The
 only


thing
 that
 matters
 is
 Ethereum's
 price.


So,
 uh,
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 you're


going to
 get
 Tom
 Lee
 like
 answering


questions.
 He's
 not
 the
 he's
 not
 the


CEO.
 So,
 I
 would
 be
 surprised
 if
 they


actually
 gave
 like
 a
 legit
 earnings
 call


because
 again,
 it's
 just
 the
 treasury
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 But
 the
 reason
 that


one's
 getting
 down
 is
 because
 Ethereum


is
 gonna
 get
 Yeah.
 November
 5th,
 right?


That's
 the
 number
 that
 I've
 been
 seeing


as
 well.


Um,


so
 there
 we
 go.
 Tom
 Lee
 took
 a


screenshot
 of
 one
 of
 your
 posts
 on
 X


yesterday
 in
 his
 research
 note.
 Well,


that's
 cool.
 I
 think
 he
 did
 that
 a


couple
 months
 ago,
 too.
 That's
 dope.


Yeah,
 look,
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 always
 on


Twitter.
 He's
 always
 engaging
 and
 he's


always
 looking
 at
 people's
 content.
 So,


that's
 super
 dope.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 again,


Ethereum,
 the
 reason
 Ethereum,
 I
 think,


is
 weak
 is
 because
 Bitcoin's
 weak.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 fundamental
 reason.


It's
 not
 like
 all
 these
 uh
 companies
 are


like,
 "Yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 use
 Salana


for
 all
 of
 our
 blockchain
 of
 choice
 in


terms
 of
 payment
 infrastructure."
 It's


like,
 no,
 they're
 all
 going
 to
 Ethereum


either
 on
 Ethereum's
 layer
 1
 or
 on
 the


on
 a
 layer
 two
 that's
 connected
 to


Ethereum.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 exactly
 why


we're
 seeing
 the
 weakness
 in
 crypto,
 but


it
 feels
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 structural.


Last
 thing
 before
 the
 market
 opens,
 this


is
 what
 JPAL
 said
 yesterday.
 We'll
 talk


more
 about
 what
 he
 said
 in
 regards
 to


the
 meeting,
 but
 he
 was
 pretty
 bullish


on
 the
 state
 of
 tech
 right
 now.


>> Right
 now,


>> yeah,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 different
 um
 in


the
 sense
 that
 these
 companies
 the


companies
 that
 are
 so
 highly
 valued


actually
 have
 earnings
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 So
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 '9s
 and


the
 dotcom,
 they
 were
 these
 are
 ideas


rather
 than
 companies
 and
 you
 know
 we're


we're
 so
 there's
 a
 clear
 bubble
 there


whereas
 the
 you
 know
 the
 I
 won't
 go
 into


particular
 names
 but
 they
 actually
 have


earnings
 and
 you
 know
 it
 it
 looks
 like


they
 have
 business
 models
 and
 uh
 and


profits
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So
 it's


it's
 really
 a
 different
 thing.
 um
 you


know
 we
 it's
 the
 the
 investment
 we're


getting
 in
 um
 equipment
 and
 in
 all
 those


things
 that
 go
 into
 creating
 data


centers
 and
 and
 feeding
 the
 AI
 it's


clearly
 part
 one
 of
 the
 big
 sources
 of


growth
 in
 the
 economy.
 Consumer
 spending


also
 though
 has
 been
 you
 know
 is
 is
 much


bigger
 than
 that
 and
 has
 been
 growing


and
 and
 has
 defied
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 you


know
 negative
 forecasts
 continuing
 to
 do


so
 this
 year.
 consumers
 are
 still


spending.
 Now,
 it
 is
 it
 it
 may
 it
 may
 be


mostly
 higherend
 consumers
 or
 may
 be


skewed
 that
 way,
 but
 the
 consumer
 is


spending
 and
 that's
 a
 big
 big
 chunk
 of


of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 economy,


bigger
 than
 substantially
 bigger
 than


AI.
 You
 can
 point
 to
 the
 to.


>> So,
 JPAL
 does
 think,
 hey,
 this
 time


feels
 a
 bit
 different
 from
 the
 dot


bubble
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


you
 do
 have
 companies
 that
 are
 spending.

 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 The
 stock

 All


right,
 wake
 your

it.

 to


see
 that
 green
 candle
 right
 there
 from


203
 to
 205.
 So,
 you
 got
 some
 people


buying
 uh
 the
 dip
 on
 Nvidia
 from
 the


pre-market.
 Google
 loses
 290
 to
 287

Google

 down
 about


1.5%.
 SoFi
 down
 at

 down
 from

 there
 at

 Reddit

down
 2%.
 Meta
 665


665.
 that
 bond
 sale
 that
 definitely


changes
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 the
 narrative
 on


Meta
 if
 they
 are
 taking
 on
 debt
 for


those
 that
 are
 just
 joining
 25
 billion


in
 corporate
 bonds
 they
 are
 raising


paying
 about
 1.4%
 above
 a
 US
 Treasury


note
 and
 as
 a
 result
 I
 think
 that's
 why


you're
 seeing
 some
 weakness
 right
 there


Meta

Apple

 Nvidia's
 at
 five
 still.
 Meta's
 at


4.04.
 And
 then
 Microsoft's
 at
 3.9.
 Where


is
 Microsoft
 stock
 right
 here?
 Microsoft


is
 at
 532.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 nothing
 for


Microsoft.
 I
 mean,
 down
 2%
 is
 nothing.


Meta
 is
 the
 one
 that's
 really
 getting


hit.
 Microsoft
 was
 at
 like
 515
 last


night,
 but
 that
 one's
 starting
 to


recover.
 GameStop's
 down
 1%.
 Intel's


down
 2%.
 Disney's
 flat.
 Duolingo's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 I
 ren
 below
 60.
 The
 Bitcoin


miners,
 I
 mean,
 everything
 the


hyperscaler
 said
 about
 capex
 is
 not
 uh


bearish
 the
 data
 center
 plays,
 but
 all


of
 them
 today
 are
 red.
 Bit
 farms
 11


cents
 away
 from
 falling
 below
 four.


Hives
 down
 2%.
 Wolves
 down
 one,


CleanSpark's
 down
 one,
 Riot's
 down
 two,


Galaxy
 down
 4%
 on
 the
 day.
 So,
 all
 the


data
 center
 plays
 getting
 hit
 even
 with


the
 increased
 capex
 guy
 from
 the
 big


tech
 companies.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 that's
 down


2%.
 ASTS
 is
 at
 78.50.
 Meta.


Wow.


654.


I
 wonder
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 take
 her


below
 650.


Gold
 is
 down,
 by
 the
 way.
 Gold
 loses


4,000
 again.
 It
 It
 briefly
 captured
 it


last
 night.
 Back
 down.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 the
 25
 billion
 bond
 thing


does
 change
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


narrative
 for
 Meta,
 at least
 in
 the


short
 term.
 at
 least
 in
 the
 short
 term.


I
 didn't
 know
 they
 were
 tapping
 the
 the


debt
 market
 as
 aggressively
 as
 they


announced
 today.


That's
 a
 bit
 aggressive.
 Now,
 Grant,
 at


this
 point,
 I
 want
 to
 get
 the
 calculated


numbers,
 but
 I
 think
 Meta's
 below
 20


times
 next
 year's
 earnings,
 which
 is


kind
 of
 stupid.
 Like,
 we're
 talking


about
 a
 company
 growing
 30%
 that's
 doing


$200
 billion
 of
 revenue
 a
 year.
 I
 mean,


like,
 that
 feels
 kind
 of
 dumb,
 but


nonetheless,
 the
 street's
 not
 liking
 it.


Coinbase
 right
 there
 down
 2.6.
 Crowd


Strike
 down
 1%.
 Coreweave.
 Wow.
 Corweave


getting
 nuked
 down
 5.4%
 and
 Nebius


down
 four.
 Nebus
 and
 Cororee
 both
 down


four.
 BMR
 are
 we
 losing
 47?
 We
 are
 at


4737.
 That's
 down
 4.7%
 as
 Ethereum


continues
 to
 get
 hit
 at
 3809.


There
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 you
 got
 in


terms
 of
 this
 reaction.
 Meta
 recovering


a
 little
 bit
 at
 660
 right
 there.
 12.4%.


AMD
 still
 down
 about
 2%.
 S&P
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 That's
 a
 pretty
 big
 move
 on
 the


S&P.
 Granted,
 it
 ran
 up
 a
 lot
 this
 whole


week.
 So,
 not
 crazy
 to
 see
 it
 retrace
 a


little bit.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 super
 greedy,
 dude.
 The
 S&P
 was
 at


690
 yesterday
 or
 689.7.
 Like,
 it's,
 you


know,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 we
 all
 want
 it
 to
 go


to
 7,000.
 That
 doesn't
 just
 go
 up


straight
 in
 a
 line.
 So,
 I
 think
 taking
 a


bit
 of
 a
 breather
 here
 is
 not
 crazy.


Palantry
 down
 1.4,
 even
 poundry,
 as
 much


as
 I
 would
 love
 for
 it
 to
 still
 be
 at


200.
 Like,
 I
 understand
 they
 haven't


even
 had
 earnings
 yet.
 And
 so,
 you
 could


see
 a
 retracement
 there.
 Tesla's
 still


holding
 450.
 I
 know it
 was
 at
 465


yesterday,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


holding
 450
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 And
 then


Nvidia
 at
 203.
 You
 saw
 from
 that
 JPAL


clip,
 he
 does
 think
 that
 this
 stock


market
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 tech
 revolution


we're
 seeing
 is
 a
 bit
 different
 from
 the


dot
 bubble
 in
 that
 these
 companies
 have


real
 earnings
 and
 every
 time
 we
 look
 at


earnings
 every
 day,
 you're
 seeing
 an


average
 beat
 of
 almost
 10%
 on
 EPS.
 So,


this
 is
 very
 real
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 growth


that's
 being
 put
 up
 in
 earnings.
 It's


just
 some
 of
 that
 multiple
 might
 already


be
 baked
 into
 the
 market
 which
 is
 why


when
 we
 got
 a
 rate
 cut
 you
 know
 we


didn't
 see
 a
 massive
 rally
 as
 well
 since


the
 market
 expected
 it.
 Google


unfortunately
 losing
 290
 still
 up
 4%


which
 is
 a
 massive
 day
 for
 Google
 but
 it


is
 losing
 that
 295
 level
 that
 it
 had.


Microsoft
 almost
 I
 mean
 I
 don't want
 to


say
 almost
 recovering
 but
 only
 down
 1.4


which
 is
 not
 too


too
 aggressive
 right
 here.
 Fizer
 or
 not


Fizer
 Ferve.


Wow,
 they're
 taking
 this
 one
 down


another
 5%.
 It
 fell
 42%
 yesterday.
 Now


another
 4.7%
 today.


Now
 another
 4.7%
 today.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.
 Five
 serve.
 I
 don't


know
 who's
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 is
 anyone


buying
 the
 F
 serve
 dip?
 I
 haven't
 really


gone
 through
 the
 earnings.
 I
 just
 know


that
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 falling
 knife,
 but


at
 some
 point
 50%
 retracement
 maybe
 it,


you
 know,
 tends
 to
 bottom.
 SMCI
 down


2.6,
 Six
 Ethereum
 down
 and
 then
 Bitcoin


continuing
 to
 get
 down.
 Roblox
 is


dumping
 as
 well.
 Not
 sure
 what
 they
 said


on
 the
 call.
 Wow,
 Roblox
 10%.
 They
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 They
 beat
 so


not
 sure
 why
 Roblox
 is
 getting
 hit
 right


here.
 But
 indeed
 it
 is
 getting
 hit.
 One


of
 the
 reasons
 the
 market
 could
 be
 down


as
 well,
 which
 again
 I
 think
 is
 a
 really


weird
 reason.
 But
 yesterday
 pal
 started


off
 the
 call
 by
 saying
 we
 are
 not
 going


to
 confirm
 the
 validity
 of
 a
 December


rate
 cut.
 And
 again,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


everyone
 already
 knows
 that
 Pal
 can't


literally
 say
 we're
 gonna
 get
 a
 December


rate
 cut,
 but
 the
 market
 was
 pricing
 at


90%.
 Now,
 the
 odds
 came
 down
 to
 70%
 and


everyone
 was
 just
 like, "Really?
 Is
 Pal


actually
 not
 going
 to
 cut
 rates
 in


December
 given
 the
 labor
 market
 that
 we


have?"
 No
 one
 believes
 it,
 but
 because


Powell
 was
 stressing
 it
 yesterday,


that
 could
 be
 another
 thing
 that's


making
 the
 market
 a
 little
 bit
 more


hesitant
 before
 going
 higher.
 And
 you


could
 see
 that
 as
 a
 reason
 along
 with


the
 fact
 that
 China
 US
 deal
 is
 not


officially
 confirmed.
 We
 have
 Trump's


comments
 and
 Ben's
 comments.
 We
 don't


have
 any
 specifics
 from
 the
 Chinese


foreign
 ministry
 and
 as
 a
 result
 you


know
 you
 might
 not
 be
 getting
 the


excitement
 from
 the
 market
 that
 a
 China


deal
 is
 legitimate
 yet


and
 that's
 why
 you
 are
 getting
 some


pain.
 Where's
 Oaklo?
 Oaklo
 is
 down
 4.8%.


How
 about
 Quantum
 Dwave
 down
 4.5.
 So


pretty
 much
 everything
 getting
 hit.


Nvidia
 what?
 Dollar
 away
 from
 losing


200.
 Bitcoin
 108.


Bottom
 for
 Bitcoin
 was
 104
 on
 October


10th
 and
 then
 we
 hovered
 around
 106.
 100


bucks
 away
 from
 losing
 108
 right
 now.


Hood
 losing
 140.
 Yeah,
 expected
 that


would
 happen
 as
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum


were
 getting
 hit


and
 that
 is
 down.
 Trump
 said
 they
 have
 a


deal
 on
 Air
 Force
 One.
 Yeah,
 Trump
 said


they
 have
 a
 deal,
 but
 you
 know,
 the


Chinese
 haven't
 confirmed
 anything
 yet.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 why
 the
 street's


just
 like,
 well,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be


that
 excited
 about
 this.
 Let's
 see.
 It's


7
 minutes
 into
 the
 market
 open.
 Let's


see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 intraday
 lows
 that


start
 to
 get
 formed.
 Right
 now,
 it's


just
 a
 falling
 knife
 across
 the
 board.
 I


mean,
 anything
 you
 buy
 right
 now,
 unless


in
 the
 next
 10
 seconds
 is
 the
 bottom,


you're
 probably
 seeing
 a
 little bit
 of
 a


lower
 price.
 So,
 you
 got
 to
 know
 that


you
 are
 quite
 literally
 DCAing
 into
 what


you're
 buying.
 But,
 let's
 see
 if
 there's


any
 bit
 of
 a
 Vshape
 that
 we
 get
 across


the
 board.
 Meta
 660.
 Meta
 feels
 like
 it


bottomed
 a
 couple
 minutes
 ago


potentially
 at
 932
 hit
 654
 then
 made
 a


recovery
 to
 661
 still
 down
 12%
 on
 the


day
 and
 we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 that
 one
 can


continue
 or
 not.
 New
 bank
 is
 green.


Okay,
 so
 what's
 green?
 New
 bank
 is


green.
 Google's
 green.
 Rathon
 and
 Loheed


Martin
 are
 green.
 Um
 let's
 look
 at
 the


semis.


Semis
 are
 all
 red
 except
 ASML
 and
 Lamb


Research.
 By
 the
 way,
 remember
 that
 Neo


robot
 video
 we
 looked
 at
 yesterday?
 I


looked
 deeper
 into
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 article.
 It
 was
 all
 tea


operated.
 All
 of
 it
 was
 tea
 operated.


All
 of
 it.
 They
 did
 an
 interview
 with


the
 CEO
 and
 he
 just
 he
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,


it
 was
 they
 showed
 the
 guy


teleoperated."
 I
 was
 like,
 "So
 why?"


Like
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 people
 were
 hyped


up
 about
 it.
 Like
 it's
 not
 real.
 It's


not
 autonomous.
 It's
 not
 doing
 anything


autonomously.


So
 that
 was
 just
 a
 joke
 of
 a
 video.
 I


don't
 even
 know
 why
 they
 put
 that
 out


there.
 But
 yeah,
 that's
 that's
 that's


not
 real.
 It's
 just
 not
 real.
 Apple,
 are


we
 green
 on
 Apple?
 Apple
 still
 losing


some
 of
 its
 green
 but
 holding
 on
 to
 271.


Margin
 rates
 came
 down
 on
 hood.
 Yeah,


look,
 the
 Fed
 cut
 rates
 by
 25
 bips,


right?
 So
 margin
 should
 be
 down.
 Your


APY
 should
 be
 down.
 You
 should
 be


getting
 notification
 from
 your
 banks
 or


your
 high
 yield
 savings
 accounts
 soon


that
 uh
 your
 rates
 will
 be
 coming
 down.


I
 mean,
 across
 the
 board,
 you
 should
 be


getting
 rates
 taking
 that
 25
 basis
 point


hit
 as
 per
 the
 Fed
 officially
 getting


rates
 down
 yesterday.
 Wow.
 Bitcoin
 1077


loses
 108


losses
 108


108.3
 now
 107


what
 a
 whipssaw
 dude
 over
 the
 past
 week


what
 a
 whipssaw
 Monday
 all-time
 highs


Friday
 was
 getting
 to
 all-time
 highs


Tuesday
 was
 whatever
 and
 then
 yesterday


Wednesday
 you
 had
 tech
 earnings
 that


were
 good
 but
 I
 guess
 not
 good
 enough


for
 the
 street
 to
 kind
 of
 hold
 on
 to


this
 given
 you
 know
 the
 street
 was
 at


all
 time
 highs
 So
 expectations
 were


really
 high
 and
 I
 think
 all
 the
 tech


companies
 delivered
 just
 didn't
 deliver


at
 the
 level
 that
 you
 need
 to
 kind
 of


bust
 through.
 Meta
 right
 there
 658
 going


back
 into
 the
 650s.
 So
 not
 holding
 on
 to


the
 660s
 right
 here.
 OpenAI
 did
 not
 go


public
 but
 they
 did
 file
 or
 there
 are


rumors
 that
 they're
 filing
 to
 go
 public


in
 the
 back
 half
 of
 2026.
 Officially


they
 would
 go
 public
 in
 27.
 Uh
 they
 are


trying
 to
 raise
 60
 billion
 in
 that
 IPO.


60
 billion
 valuation
 would
 be
 a


trillion.
 Again,
 love
 or
 hate
 OpenAI,


they
 are
 too
 connected
 to
 the
 AI
 market.


I
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 hate
 Open
 AAI
 and
 you


think
 it's
 a
 scam,
 you've
 got
 to
 sell


all
 your
 AI
 stocks
 because
 the
 amount
 of


market
 cap
 that
 AMD,
 Oracle,
 Nvidia,


Broadcom,
 etc.
 have
 moved
 because
 of


announcing
 something
 with
 OpenAI
 makes


them
 too
 big
 to
 fail.
 Like,
 love
 it
 or


hate
 it,
 it
 really
 makes
 them
 too
 big
 to


fail.


And
 so,
 and
 you
 you
 could
 say,
 well,


Google's
 a
 better
 chatbot.
 You
 could
 say


you
 could
 say
 you
 like
 Google
 more
 and


all
 that
 stuff.
 The
 problem
 is
 all
 these


companies
 have
 signed
 deals
 with
 OpenAI.


So
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 if
 like


Gemini
 is
 better
 than
 Chatty.
 The
 fact


is
 that
 all
 these
 backlogs
 of
 remaining


performance
 obligations
 that
 the
 street


is
 giving
 a
 multiple
 to
 is
 because
 of


one
 company
 and
 that
 company
 is
 OpenAI.


It
 is
 a
 bit
 scary
 to
 think
 that
 they
 are


the
 lynch
 pin
 of
 this
 but
 like
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 they
 have
 to
 win.


They
 pretty
 much
 have
 to
 win
 right
 here.


Oscar
 is
 almost
 green.
 You're
 getting
 a


little
 recovery
 there
 on
 Oscar.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 UNH
 tanked
 yesterday.
 UNH
 back


to
 353.
 Fell
 all
 the
 way
 from
 390
 to


353.
 I
 guess
 it
 was
 just
 an
 earnings


dump,
 but
 United
 Health
 is
 down.
 Open


AAI
 helps
 unless
 you're
 PayPal.
 Yes,


unless
 you're
 PayPal.
 Open
 AAI
 can
 pump


your
 stock.


At least
 PayPal's
 low
 green
 today.
 Did


lose
 the
 entire
 pump
 yesterday,
 dude.
 It


was
 crazy.


The
 entire
 pump.
 It
 got
 hit.
 SoFi
 29.


Really?
 Wow.
 The
 Sofi
 29.


SoFi
 is
 down.


Mid
 said
 big
 tech
 was
 going
 to
 crush.


Yeah,
 it
 crushed
 the
 market.
 That's


that's
 what
 big
 tech
 did.
 No,
 but
 big


tech
 did
 crush
 objectively.
 Like
 we
 went


through
 all
 the
 numbers.
 Big
 tech


absolute
 absolutely
 smashed
 it.
 The


problem
 is
 you
 had
 I
 mean
 look
 this
 is


why
 trading
 earnings.
 There
 was
 a
 couple


people
 on
 Twitter
 who
 took
 these


screenshots
 of
 like
 buying
 these
 calls


on
 Meta
 for
 like,
 you
 know,
 780
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 week
 and
 they
 were
 paying


5,000
 a
 premium.
 And
 I'm
 looking
 at


these
 screenshots.
 I'm
 like,
 dude,
 that


means
 the
 stock
 has
 to
 be
 well
 above


that
 price
 plus
 the
 premium
 that
 you're


paying.
 And
 you
 only
 have
 a
 couple
 days


to
 make
 that
 happen.
 You
 don't
 know
 what


Meta
 is
 going
 to
 say.
 Guess
 what?
 They


have
 to
 pay
 15
 billion
 in
 taxes.
 This
 is


why
 it's
 hard
 to
 trade
 earnings.
 If
 they


didn't
 do
 that,
 they
 would
 have
 beat
 EPS


by
 10%.


Microsoft
 and
 Google
 crushed
 as
 well.


Microsoft
 not
 as
 big
 of
 a
 crush
 as


Google.
 Google
 crushed
 like
 crazy.
 But


Google
 also
 was
 at
 all-time
 highs
 before


they
 crushed.
 So,
 it
 makes
 sense
 that


they're
 not
 like
 going
 to
 the
 moon


because,
 you
 know,
 they
 were
 pumping
 3%


on
 a
 multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 company


before
 they
 crushed.
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 think


this
 is
 unhealthy
 by
 any
 sense
 of
 the


imagination.
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 a
 knee-jerk


reaction
 on
 Meta
 and
 the
 bonds
 that
 they


raised
 this
 morning
 complicates
 a
 little


bit
 more,
 but
 like
 sometimes
 you
 never


know
 what
 these
 companies
 are
 going
 to


report.
 Just
 like
 three
 quarters
 ago


when
 Google
 reported
 an
 EPS
 of
 40%.
 If


you
 were
 short
 Google
 because
 you


thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 suck
 for


whatever
 reason
 and
 then
 their
 SpaceX


investment
 they
 get
 to
 finally
 realize


that
 $8
 billion
 gain
 and
 EPS
 by
 40%.


Like
 some
 some
 of
 these
 things
 just
 come


out
 of
 the
 blue
 and
 you
 have
 no
 idea
 how


to
 trade
 them.
 But
 I
 think
 big
 tech


earnings
 did
 crush.
 Now
 Amazon's
 got
 to


keep
 up
 the
 party
 today.
 And
 we'll
 talk


more
 about
 Amazon.
 I
 have
 no
 I I
 have
 an


idea
 of
 what
 to
 expect,
 but
 I'm
 a
 bit


scared
 because
 there's
 two
 different


directions
 I
 think
 Amazon
 could
 go
 in


regards
 to
 the
 layoff
 announcement
 and


AWS
 growth.
 But
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 today


is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 really
 important
 as


well.


SPGI,
 this
 one
 S&P
 Global,
 they
 crushed


earnings
 as
 well.
 They're
 up
 5%.
 This


one
 usually
 doesn't
 move
 5%
 as
 well.


Carvana
 didn't
 have
 the
 best
 earnings.


That's
 why
 Carvana
 is
 down
 14%.
 Uh
 Jim


Chenos
 is
 probably
 very
 happy
 about
 that


because
 he's
 short.
 But
 S&P
 Global,
 they


beat
 by
 7%
 on
 EPS.
 Uh
 473
 versus
 441,


3.8
 versus
 3.8
 billion
 on
 revenue.


And


that
 is
 a
 beat
 as
 well.
 Um
 Carvana


missed
 on
 estimates,
 but
 the
 used
 car


market,
 I
 mean,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


it
 for
 a
 while,
 has
 not
 been
 in
 the


healthiest


situation.
 And
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 think


Carvana
 has,
 you
 know,
 been
 having
 some


issues
 keeping
 up
 as
 well.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 what
 else
 do
 we
 have.


Gold
 is
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day.


eBay
 shares
 down
 15%.
 Wow.


We
 didn't
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 look
 that


deeply
 at
 eBay's
 earnings,
 but
 it
 looks


like
 they
 missed
 on
 one
 of
 Wow,
 eBay


15%.
 Goodness.


Uh,
 I'll
 pull
 up
 those
 numbers
 in
 a


second.
 eBay.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of these


consumer
 companies,
 eBay,
 Chipotle,
 you


have
 other
 consumer
 companies
 that
 are


crushing
 it,
 but
 then
 you
 have
 other


ones
 that
 are
 signaling
 potentially
 that


there
 could
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 weakness
 right


here.
 eBay
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 I
 guess
 they
 had
 to
 say


something
 that
 got
 the
 street
 upset.
 2%


EPS,
 3%
 revenue.
 That's
 down.
 Chipotle


again,
 uh,
 just
 not
 a
 good
 quarter.
 and


CEO
 said
 that
 there's
 declining
 foot


traffic
 in
 their
 most
 important


demographic.
 Right?
 They're
 down
 19.2%.


Bill
 Aman,
 if
 the
 data
 is
 correct,
 he


could
 have
 sold
 since
 Q3.


Uh
 but
 Bill
 Aman
 owns
 Chipotle.
 How
 much


does
 he
 own
 of
 it?
 He
 owns
 21
 million


shares
 now.
 I
 I
 think
 he's
 owned
 it


since
 like
 2014,


but
 this
 one's
 definitely
 causing
 a
 bit


of
 strain
 on
 his
 portfolio
 today.
 He


also
 owns
 5
 million
 shares
 of
 Google,


which
 he
 bought
 at
 like
 90
 bucks.


So,
 you
 got
 Google
 going
 up,
 but


Chipotle
 getting
 hit.


Uh,
 Doug
 says,
 "How
 are
 we
 red
 this
 day


and
 VIX
 is
 down?
 Is
 the
 VIX
 actually


down?"


Wow,
 the
 VIX
 is
 actually
 down.
 You
 know,


I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 the
 VIX
 is


down
 is
 because
 this
 is
 not
 like
 a
 sort


of
 immediate


panic
 cell
 type
 of
 moment.
 This
 is
 a


more
 natural,
 hey,
 some
 earnings
 were


good,
 some
 earnings
 weren't
 good.
 We're


confused
 about
 China,
 yada
 yada,
 and


you've
 got
 you've
 got
 tons
 of
 buyers


coming
 in,
 you
 got
 tons
 of
 sellers


coming
 in
 back
 and
 forth,
 but
 it's
 not


like
 a
 VIX
 spike
 type
 of
 moment.
 You


would
 expect
 the
 VIX
 to
 go
 up
 a
 little


bit
 more,
 though.
 S&P
 potentially


forming
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 base
 right
 here
 on


the
 bottom
 at
 around
 942


681.
 Are
 we
 seeing
 that
 with
 other


companies?
 Yeah,
 we're
 seeing
 that
 with


AMD
 at
 around
 940,
 257
 to
 259.
 Same


thing
 with
 googs
 280
 to
 282.
 Same
 thing


with
 Tessie
 4
 940
 448
 to
 452.
 Robinet
 as


well
 back
 to
 140.
 At
 940
 we
 had
 13911.


Now
 you're
 at
 14122.


And
 then
 Nvidia
 also
 was
 at
 2011
 to
 203.


So
 let's
 see
 if
 that
 940
 bottom


potentially


is
 able
 to
 hold.
 Oh,
 Snowflake.
 Dude,


the
 story
 on
 Snowflake
 is
 crazy,
 bro.


The
 story
 on
 Snowflake
 is
 crazy.


So,
 what
 happened
 yesterday
 with


Snowflake?
 Well,
 there
 was


to
 do
 with
 Tik
 Tok.
 Everything
 comes


back


to
 what
 goes
 on
 with
 Tik
 Tok.
 Uh,
 there


was
 this
 Tik
 Tok
 account
 that
 like


follows
 people
 and
 asks
 them
 about
 their


like
 their
 like
 their
 their
 life
 and
 how


they've
 how
 they've
 been
 successful
 and


all
 this
 stuff.
 And
 this
 dude
 ran
 into


the
 snowflake
 chief
 revenue
 officer
 and


he
 basically
 asked
 him,
 "Are
 you
 guys


going
 to
 like
 hit
 your
 metrics?"
 And
 he


admitted
 yes
 in
 the
 video.


And
 it
 was
 just
 like
 it
 was
 it
 was
 weird


cuz
 the
 way
 he
 said
 it
 kind
 of
 got
 the


street
 upset.
 This
 was
 the
 video.
 Let
 me


just
 pull
 it
 up
 right
 here.
 And
 then


Snowflake
 had
 to
 file
 an
 8K
 clarifying


what
 he
 said.


>> Instagram
 feed.


>> How
 old
 were
 you
 when
 you
 became
 a


millionaire?


>> Oh
 boy.
 Four
 years
 ago.
 And
 what
 line
 of


business?


>> Technology.


>> What
 do
 you
 do
 in
 tech?


>> Uh
 CRO
 for
 Snowflake.


>> Did
 you
 guys
 just
 go
 public?


>> Uh
 we
 went
 public
 5
 years
 ago
 during
 co


couldn't
 ring
 the
 bell.
 So
 this
 is
 our


>> Do
 you
 recommend
 entrepreneurs
 take


their
 company
 public?
 Because
 there's
 a


risk
 there
 as
 well
 when
 you
 bring
 in
 all


that
 capital,
 you
 bring
 in
 voting


shares.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 going


public
 as
 opposed
 to
 staying
 private?


>> Good
 question.


>> Sorry.
 I
 promise.
 We
 got
 17
 million


followers.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 the
 best


marketing
 he
 can
 do.


>> I
 know.


>> All right.
 Just
 keep
 it
 rolling.
 Hey,


we're
 keeping
 this
 [ __ ]
 rolling,
 man.


Sir,
 real
 quick.
 Could
 I
 finish
 real


quick
 with
 you
 real
 quick
 for
 one


minute?


>> We'll
 do
 30
 seconds.


>> 30
 seconds
 is
 cool.
 All right.
 What
 do


you
 think
 most
 people
 get
 wrong
 about


cash
 flow
 when
 they're
 building
 a


company?


>> Pre-p
 profofitability.
 Cash
 flow
 is


king.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> Cash.


>> Okay,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 listen
 to
 the


whole
 thing,
 but
 basically
 he
 ends
 up


admitting
 that
 their
 numbers
 are
 doing


well.
 And
 then
 Snowflake
 has
 to
 say
 on


October
 26,
 the
 Instagram
 account
 named


the
 school
 of
 hard
 knocks
 posted
 an


interview
 on
 Instagram
 and
 related


platforms
 with
 an
 executive
 officer
 of


Snowflake
 in
 which
 the
 officer
 made


certain
 statements
 regarding
 the


company's
 future
 results.
 No
 one
 should


take
 these
 uh
 results
 seriously.
 The


company
 reaffirms
 the
 revenue
 guidance


for
 Q3.


Hilarious,
 bro.
 Absolutely
 freaking


hilarious.
 270
 right
 there
 on
 Snowflake.


Uh
 but
 basically
 he
 admitted
 Snowflake's


going to
 have
 a
 good
 Q3
 and
 hopefully


that
 continues.
 All
 right,
 we're
 seeing


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 potential
 V.
 Meta,
 a


couple
 bucks
 away
 from
 670.


Couple
 bucks
 away
 from
 670.
 Grab
 above


six.
 It
 was
 at
 592.
 Amazon
 still
 down


two.
 It
 did
 get
 to
 223.
 Amazon
 at
 225.


Meta
 now
 667.
 Nvidia
 almost
 back
 to
 204.


Maybe
 940.


Maybe
 940
 was
 the
 bottom,
 folks.


Maybe.


How
 is
 the
 dude
 who
 bought
 millions
 of


685
 spy
 puts
 doing
 today?
 Well,
 he's


doing
 a
 lot
 better
 than
 the
 person
 who


bought
 the
 meta
 calls.
 There
 was
 someone


who
 there
 was
 actually
 someone
 who


bought
 5
 million
 of
 Meta
 puts
 as
 well
 at


at
 around
 that
 same
 price,
 685
 to
 690.


So,
 you
 did
 have
 some
 people
 definitely


think
 that
 Meta
 was
 not
 going
 to
 crush


and
 they
 didn't.


But,
 you
 know,
 when
 the
 S&P
 hits
 alltime


highs,
 you
 have a
 ton
 of
 put
 buyers


coming
 in
 because
 that's
 when
 puts


become
 cheap,
 right?
 So,
 if
 there's


going
 to
 be
 any
 weakness,
 that's
 where


the
 puts
 can
 start
 to
 print.
 BMR
 47


4767.
 Yeah,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 from


4714.


So,
 you
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 there.
 He


knew
 about
 the
 tax
 charge.
 Maybe
 maybe


he
 knew
 about
 the
 tax
 charge,


but
 you
 do
 have
 Meta
 trying
 to
 recover


right
 here.
 That
 channel,
 that
 Tik
 Tok


channel
 I've
 seen
 before.
 It's
 actually


not
 a
 bad
 channel.
 It's
 actually
 like


the
 guy
 walks
 around
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 uh


rich
 cities
 like
 Naples
 and
 he
 gets
 a


bunch
 of
 good
 interviews.
 It's
 just
 if


you're
 a
 CRO
 of
 a
 public
 company,
 you


you
 can't
 tell
 him
 what
 you
 told
 him.


Like
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 give
 him


general
 business
 advice,
 not
 you
 know,


you
 know,
 we
 did
 great
 for
 Q3.
 Our


operating
 cash
 flow
 was
 incredible.
 It's


like,
 dude,
 this
 guy


this
 guy's
 not
 an
 analyst.
 He's
 an


entertainer.


But
 that
 was
 hilarious
 just
 seeing
 that


yesterday.


Okay,
 Bitcoin
 also
 potentially
 back
 to


108.
 You're
 getting
 a
 little
 recovery,


right?
 Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Bitcoin
 108.


Okay,
 at
 the
 worst
 of
 it,
 I
 was
 down


115.
 Now
 I'm
 down
 seven.


I
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 legit
 V
 that
 we're


starting
 today.
 If
 we
 can
 go
 green
 on


the
 S&P,
 that
 would
 be
 incredible.
 I'm


looking
 at
 my
 portfolio
 right
 now
 for


the
 first
 time
 today.
 At
 around
 940,
 it


was
 down
 115


and
 now
 it's
 down
 8,400.


That's
 not
 too
 bad,
 bro.
 Look
 at
 Look
 at


this.
 Look
 at
 these
 green
 candles
 on
 the


S&P.
 Look
 at
 that.
 It's
 back
 to
 685
 from


681.


Bitcoin
 106
 to
 108
 and
 then
 Ethereum.


See,
 Ethereum
 is
 not
 really
 moving
 the


way
 Bitcoin's
 moving
 in
 a
 pure
 V.
 This


one's
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more


complicated
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 a


recovery,
 but
 it
 is
 trying
 to
 move.
 And


then
 Apple
 back
 to
 271.


Apple
 back
 to
 271.
 Don't
 have
 any
 Trump


tweets
 yet.
 Not
 seeing
 it
 at
 the
 moment.


Salesforce,
 look
 at
 that.
 256.


Salesforce
 going
 green
 as
 well.
 That's


up
 2%.


Uh,
 do
 you
 think
 Amazon
 will
 have
 good


earnings?
 We'll
 talk
 about
 it
 more.


Look,
 I
 think
 that,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 this


unequivocally.
 Amazon
 will
 be
 below
 200


or
 close
 to
 200
 if
 AWS
 growth
 is
 not


what
 the
 street
 wants
 to
 see.
 Having


said
 that,
 the
 reason
 they
 cut
 15,000


people
 with
 another
 15,000
 layoffs


getting
 ready
 to
 happen
 over
 the
 next


two
 months
 is
 because
 I
 think
 they
 want


to
 cushion
 the
 lack
 of
 potential
 AWS


guidance
 by
 saying,
 "Look,
 we
 cut
 a
 ton


of
 jobs
 and
 therefore,
 you
 know,
 our


operating
 margins
 are
 going
 to
 inflect


even
 if
 AWS
 growth
 is
 not
 that
 good."


That's
 the
 bearish
 scenario.
 The
 bullish


scenario
 is
 Amazon
 comes
 out
 and
 says,


"We
 have
 way
 more
 demand
 than
 we
 can


handle.
 This
 is
 why
 we
 have
 to
 cut
 some


of these
 workers
 to
 kind
 of
 increase


more
 capacity
 to
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 GPUs,


yada
 yada."
 Uh,
 and
 also,
 you
 know,
 the


streets
 expecting
 18%,
 we
 come
 in
 at


18.7,
 right?
 Any
 level
 of
 a
 beat
 off
 of


a
 big
 base
 maybe
 gets
 the
 street
 to


think
 this
 AWS
 story
 is
 a
 story
 they


can't
 easily
 fade.
 And
 that
 sends
 the


stock
 to
 240.
 I
 don't
 think
 anything


else
 in
 the
 business,
 advertising,


e-commerce,
 I
 don't
 think
 anything
 else


is
 relevant.
 Meta,
 by
 the
 way,
 back


above
 671.
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 operating


margins
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 AWS.
 And


I
 really
 could
 see
 the
 stock
 falling


below
 200.
 I
 I'm
 just
 convinced
 at
 this


point
 Meta
 is
 a
 10-year
 hold.
 In
 the
 age


of
 robotics,
 there
 is
 no
 other
 company


besides
 Tesla
 that
 is
 going
 to
 benefit


like
 an
 Amazon.
 Uh
 and
 I
 am
 more


convinced
 than
 not
 that
 Amazon
 is
 going


to
 have
 so
 many
 different
 verticals
 that


they
 can
 they
 can
 expand
 to
 over
 the


next
 10
 years
 with
 AI,
 with
 the
 advance


of
 robotics
 as
 well,
 uh
 to
 just
 make


themselves
 more
 efficient.
 Remember,


Amazon's
 operating
 margins
 are
 12%.
 That


goes
 up
 to
 15%
 in
 the
 next
 couple
 years.


We're
 talking
 about
 tens
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 net
 income.
 And
 Amazon
 is


trading
 at
 its
 lowest
 EBIDA
 multiple
 in


its
 stock
 price
 history.
 And
 it's


trading
 at
 a
 56%
 discount
 to
 every
 other


Mac
 7.
 Maybe
 not
 Meta
 today
 because
 Meta


took
 a
 dip.
 But
 if
 we
 get
 a
 dip,
 I
 would


welcome
 it.
 I
 really
 wouldn't
 be
 too


upset
 as
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 building
 up
 the


position,
 but
 I
 also
 could
 see
 it
 moving


much
 higher
 if
 AWS
 is
 not
 as
 bad.


So
 today
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 happens


with
 with
 Amazon.


Amit,
 should
 we
 sell
 BMR?
 You
 should


sell
 BMR
 if
 you
 lose
 conviction
 in


Ethereum.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 very
 simple.


You
 either
 understand
 the
 ETH
 thesis


over
 the
 next
 5
 years
 or
 you
 don't.
 If


you
 don't
 and
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be


leveraged
 against
 it,
 then
 or
 maybe
 you


do
 and
 you
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a


leveraged
 digital
 asset
 treasury.
 So


then
 you
 buy
 ETH
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to


buy
 Bitmine.


But
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 there
 should
 be


complaining
 about
 Bitmine
 if
 you


understand
 a
 deeper
 understanding
 of


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Ethereum.
 And
 I


feel
 like
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more
 we
 are


seeing
 the
 advance
 of
 tokenization
 and


stable
 coins
 at
 scale.
 I
 mean
 this
 was


Larry
 Frink
 yesterday
 for
 those
 that


want
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 context
 on
 this


speaking
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 about
 how


serious
 this
 tokenization
 revolution
 is


and
 why
 the
 future
 of
 finance
 is


tokenized.
 Which
 means
 if
 you
 believe


the
 future
 of
 finance
 and
 the
 future
 of


that
 tokenization
 happens
 on
 ETH,
 that


is
 your
 bullcase
 for
 Bitmine.
 I
 would


say
 the
 biggest
 question
 from
 central


banks
 is
 what
 is
 the
 role
 of


tokenization
 and
 digitization?
 How


quickly
 should
 they
 think
 about


digitizing
 their
 own
 currency?
 What
 does


that
 mean
 for
 the
 role
 of
 the
 dollar?
 If


every
 currency
 digitizes
 and
 we
 have
 a


you
 know
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 bank


payments?
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 the


for
 the
 payment
 companies
 like


Mastercard
 and
 Visa?
 All
 these
 are
 being


questioned
 right
 now.
 I
 will
 make,
 you


know,
 we
 I
 think
 we
 spend
 so
 much
 time


talking
 about
 a
 AI.
 We're
 not
 spending


enough
 time
 talking
 about
 what
 how


quickly
 we're
 going
 to
 tokenize
 every


financial
 asset
 and
 the
 opportunity


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 have
 a
 digital


wallet
 and
 moving,
 you
 know,
 ETFs
 and


other
 things
 through
 a
 digital
 wallet.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 happen


worldwide
 very
 rapidly.
 And
 I
 think
 most


countries
 are
 illprepared
 for
 that
 and


underappreciate
 how
 technology
 is


changing
 that
 not
 not
 unlike
 how


technology
 is
 changing
 AI
 and
 other


things.
 It
 will
 be
 changing
 uh
 the


technology
 around
 the
 plumbing
 of


finance.


>> I
 think
 you
 either
 believe
 that
 or
 not


and
 Larry
 Fank's
 not
 the
 only
 guy
 who's


making
 that
 argument.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of


smart
 people
 in
 the
 industry.
 Vlad
 being


one
 of
 them
 that
 you
 know
 I
 deeply


respect
 who
 believes
 that
 it's
 going
 to


happen.


And
 so
 that's
 your
 that's
 your
 bullcase.


But
 obviously
 I
 understand
 Ethereum's


price
 has
 been
 lagging
 and
 so
 people
 you


know
 price
 drives
 all
 the
 sentiment
 and


all
 the
 emotions
 behind
 it.
 So
 if
 you


hate
 the
 price
 action
 that
 much
 then
 you


get
 out
 of
 it.
 It's
 that
 simple.


But
 if
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 fundamental


thesis
 then
 you
 you
 keep
 going.
 Also
 I


mean
 again
 this
 is
 why
 we
 talk
 about


selling
 covered
 calls
 on
 the
 channel.
 I


mean
 like
 if
 you
 really
 are
 are
 annoyed


at
 BMR
 price
 action
 the
 covered
 calls


are
 still
 incredible.
 you
 can
 get,
 you


know,
 getting
 10%
 in
 a
 couple
 weeks
 on


these
 premiums.
 So,
 if
 you
 really


believe
 BMR
 will
 be
 stuck
 between
 47
 and


55,
 let's
 give
 it
 the
 range.
 You
 can


sell
 a
 covered
 call
 for
 55
 a
 month
 out


and
 collect
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 premium


and
 you
 get
 paid
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 those


shares,
 reduce
 your
 cost
 basis.
 Now,
 if


it
 runs
 up
 to
 the
 moon,
 you
 can't
 be
 too


upset,
 right?
 Because
 then
 your
 covered


calls
 are
 underwater.
 But
 if
 you
 really


do
 think,
 look,
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 own
 this


and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 stuck,
 I
 might
 as


well
 yield
 some
 income
 off
 of
 it,
 then


the
 options
 market
 and
 it's
 the
 28th


most
 liquid
 stock
 in
 the
 market.
 There's


plenty
 of
 premium
 that
 you
 can
 get
 from


people
 that
 are
 buying
 those
 calls.


Google,
 by
 the
 way,
 trying
 to
 get
 back


to
 290,
 getting
 a
 real
 V
 on
 Google
 from


280.
 It
 almost
 lost
 280,
 now
 up
 to
 287.


did
 hit
 289,


but
 that
 one
 is
 slightly
 green
 as
 well.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 macro


data
 coming
 out.
 Microsoft,
 where
 is


Microsoft?
 How's
 that
 one
 doing?
 Who


bought
 the
 dip
 today?
 Did
 anyone
 buy


anything?
 Palent,
 by
 the
 way,
 trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 199.
 Meta,
 SoFi,
 Microsoft,


let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 anyone
 bought


anything.
 Paler,
 right
 there,
 1988.


We
 did
 see
 200
 yesterday,
 which
 was


really
 nice
 to
 see.


And
 that's
 making
 its
 move
 before


earnings.
 Uh,
 Monday
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 day
 for
 Paler.
 That's
 when
 we
 got


earnings.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 Oh,


where's
 Amcore?
 Amcor
 is
 3242.


Rubric,
 why
 does
 anyone
 know
 why
 Rubric


got
 smashed
 over
 the
 past
 week?
 I
 don't


understand.
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 feel
 like
 we


would
 have
 covered
 their
 earnings
 if


they
 had
 it,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 this


is
 down
 12%
 in
 the
 past
 month.
 This
 one


did
 get
 hit.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 buy
 metas.
 I


see
 a
 lot
 of
 metas.


Lots
 and
 lots
 of
 metas.


Uh,
 sold
 Tessie
 30%
 profits.


Yes,
 we
 have
 Grab
 on
 Monday
 as
 well.


Coreweave,
 Reddit
 is
 Reddit.
 Reddit's
 uh


next
 week,
 right?
 Reddit's
 not
 today.


Today,
 what
 do
 we
 have
 after
 the
 bell?


We
 have
 Amazon.
 We
 have
 uh
 Apple,
 we


have
 coin
 Oh,
 we
 have
 Reddit
 today.


Coinbase,
 Reddit,
 Micro
 Strategy,


Cloudflare,
 Roku,
 First
 Solar,
 Twilio,


Amazon,
 Apple,
 Riot,
 Rocket
 Mortgage,


Lumen,
 GoDaddy,
 and
 Zillow
 Group.
 Okay,


so
 today's
 going to
 be
 a
 wild
 day.


Wow.
 Pounder
 1990.


She's
 going
 for
 the
 200o.
 She
 might


allow
 us
 to
 ring
 the
 bell
 at
 200o.


She
 might
 let
 us
 do
 it.
 There
 you
 go.


Dude,
 the
 fact
 that
 Pounder
 is
 going


green
 and
 everything
 else
 is
 still


pretty
 much
 red.
 I
 mean,
 Google
 goes


green,
 everything
 else
 trying
 to
 recover


red,
 but
 it
 shows
 you
 the
 strength
 on


that
 one.
 And
 then
 Robinet
 also
 14292.


This
 just
 fell
 to
 139.


Bought
 Meta,
 bought
 Microsoft,


SoFi.
 Yep.
 30.52.
 Look
 at
 that.
 SoFi


from
 2950
 to
 30.5.
 I
 think
 SoFi
 is
 being


controlled
 in
 a
 range
 as
 well.
 did
 get
 a


couple
 upgrades.
 Still
 a
 couple
 not


downgrades,
 but
 sell
 ratings
 after
 those


earnings,
 which
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 some


of these
 analysts
 just
 don't
 really
 love


the
 story.
 But


you
 do
 have
 some
 down
 some
 some
 sell


ratings
 after
 those
 earnings.
 Uh
 Nvidia


right
 there,
 20392,
 S&P
 is
 flat,
 AMD


262.
 Where's
 Open
 Door?
 That
 one's
 down


5.2.
 Open
 door
 is
 getting
 hit.
 The
 meme


stock
 ETF
 is
 getting
 hit
 2.89%.
 ASST


this
 is
 up
 2%
 128


and
 then
 BMR
 is
 at
 9
 4745


bought
 QXO.
 I
 have
 not
 read
 Steve's


article
 yet.
 I
 have
 to
 look
 into
 it.
 Um


we
 were
 talking
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 it
 on


the
 phone
 but
 I've
 not
 done
 any
 real
 due


diligence


on
 this
 one
 yet.


Why
 is
 Meta
 down?
 Again,
 we
 talked
 about


Meta
 uh
 that
 tax
 charge
 they
 took,
 the


increase
 of
 capex
 significantly
 that


they
 guided
 for
 for
 226.
 All
 of
 that


could
 be
 getting
 the
 street
 to
 be
 a
 bit


more
 upset


about
 operational
 cost
 efficiencies


and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 a


little
 bit
 of
 pain
 right
 here.
 Now,


another
 reason
 you
 could
 be
 getting
 some


pain
 is
 due
 to
 the
 labor
 market
 and
 the


thesis
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 labor


market.
 Um,
 as
 per
 what
 we
 saw


yesterday
 with
 uh
 with
 JPAL,
 he
 said
 a


couple
 different
 things
 about
 the
 labor


market
 that
 to
 me
 just
 signals
 we're


going
 to
 get
 that
 December
 cut,
 but


nonetheless,
 he
 is
 admitting
 the
 labor


market
 is
 potentially
 weakening,


which
 is
 something
 we
 cannot
 necessarily


ignore.


Nick
 says,
 I
 ba
 dip
 at
 660.
 Yeah,
 it


looks
 like
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 people
 took


650
 or
 660
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.


Um


yeah,
 I
 mean
 so
 far
 you're
 seeing
 a
 bit


of
 recovery
 here.


This
 market
 is
 resilient.
 This
 market


has
 been
 resilient
 all
 year.
 I
 don't


think
 anyone
 really
 had
 a
 reason
 why
 we


were
 down
 outside
 of
 the
 China
 deal
 not


being
 official.
 So
 that
 itself
 could
 be


a
 reason
 for
 the
 recovery


as
 people
 start
 to
 come
 in.
 Rocket
 Lab,


are
 you
 getting
 a
 recovery
 there?
 That


was
 down
 2%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 still
 down
 three


64.


Well,
 it
 actually
 fell
 to
 6289.
 So,
 that


went
 back
 264.
 Roblox,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 why


Roblox
 is
 crashing
 at
 all.


11%
 hit.
 I
 will
 try
 to
 get
 some
 updates


on
 that
 one.
 It's
 got
 to
 be
 something


they
 said
 on
 the
 call
 that's
 getting


people
 upset


on
 Roblox.
 Let's
 get
 the
 China
 update


and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 here.


site
 lit
 up
 with
 a
 message
 noting
 that


China
 is
 quickly
 catching
 up
 to
 the
 US


in
 number
 of
 nuclear
 weapons
 and


announcing
 that
 the
 US
 will
 restart


nuclear
 weapons
 testing
 which
 it
 hasn't


done
 since
 1992
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 cold


war.
 Now,
 despite
 that
 nuclear
 saber


rattling,
 the
 meeting
 between
 uh
 Trump


and
 Xiinping
 did
 go
 forward
 as
 planned.


But
 afterward,
 a
 lot
 of
 details
 remained


unresolved,
 including
 the
 fate
 of
 Tik


Tok
 and
 the
 question
 of
 advanced
 Nvidia


chip
 technology
 exports
 to
 China.


They're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 to
 Nvidia


and
 others
 about
 taking
 chips.
 Look,
 we


made
 great
 chips.
 Nvidia
 is
 the
 leader.


And
 uh
 I'll
 be
 speaking
 to
 Jensen
 from


Nvidia,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 be


discussing
 that
 with
 the
 video
 to
 see


whether
 or
 not
 they
 can
 do
 I
 said
 that's


really
 between
 you
 and
 the
 video,
 but


we're
 sort
 of
 the
 arbitrator
 of
 the


referee.


>> And
 President
 Xi,
 for
 his
 part,
 struck
 a


measured
 tone
 in
 his
 description
 of
 the


tensions
 between
 the
 two
 sides.


Given
 our
 different
 national
 conditions,


we
 do
 not
 always
 see
 eye
 to
 eye
 with


each
 other.
 And
 it
 is
 normal


for
 the
 two
 leading
 economies
 of
 the


world
 to
 have
 frictions
 now
 and
 then.


And
 in
 the
 face
 of
 winds,
 waves
 and


challenges,
 you
 and
 I
 at
 the
 helm
 of


Chinese
 US
 relations
 should
 stay
 the


right
 course


and
 ensure
 the
 steady
 sailing
 forward
 of


the
 giant
 ship
 of
 China
 US
 relations.


>> In
 a
 TV
 interview
 from
 South
 Korea
 this


morning,
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott


Bessant
 said
 the
 Chinese
 had
 agreed
 to


renew
 soybean
 purchases
 at
 a
 level
 that


would
 put
 them
 just
 below
 what
 they


purchased
 back
 in
 2024.
 And
 President


Trump
 said
 the
 two
 sides
 had
 agreed
 on
 a


number
 of
 items.
 A
 one-year
 agreement
 on


Chinese
 continuing
 exports
 of
 rare


earths.
 US
 reducing
 fentinol
 tariffs
 on


China
 from
 20
 down
 to
 10%
 that
 would
 be


effective
 immediately.
 China,
 he
 said,


is
 going
 to
 work
 very
 hard
 to
 stop
 the


flow
 of
 fentinol
 to
 the
 United
 States.


Trump
 said
 overall
 Chinese
 tariffs
 will


now
 be
 around
 47%
 and
 he's
 not
 going
 to


impose
 those
 threatened
 100%
 November


1st
 tariffs.
 And
 the
 president
 said
 he's


going
 to
 go
 to
 China
 in
 April.
 Now
 on


Tik
 Tok,
 guys,
 a
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of


Commerce
 spokesman
 said
 simply,
 "China


will
 properly
 address
 issues
 related
 to


Tik
 Tok."
 Not
 clear
 exactly
 what
 that


means.
 Bessant
 said
 in
 his
 interview


that
 the
 Tik
 Tok
 issue
 could
 be
 resolved


in
 the
 coming
 weeks
 or
 months.
 And
 in


the
 end,
 the
 president
 said
 that
 nuclear


weapons
 post
 made
 just
 before
 the


meeting
 wasn't
 directed
 at
 China
 after


all.
 He
 said
 it
 was
 directed
 at
 others


who
 he
 didn't
 name.
 Back
 over
 to
 you


guys.


>> Okay,
 so
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 with
 the


Chinese
 update.
 Markets
 once
 again
 get
 a


red
 candle.
 You
 were
 making
 a
 little
 bit


of
 momentum
 and
 then
 boom,


you
 get
 hit
 at
 what
 10:04.


10:04
 everything
 gets
 hit
 again.


This
 is
 a
 choppy
 day.
 This
 looks
 like


this
 might
 end
 up
 being
 a
 choppy
 day.
 Uh


let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 heat
 map
 right


here.
 And
 again,
 you
 can
 see
 even
 from


that
 from
 that
 clip
 about
 Trump
 and


China,
 it's
 like
 there's
 not
 a
 full


resolution
 yet.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 also


the
 reason
 the
 markets
 aren't
 just


straight
 to
 the
 moon
 because
 of
 this


photo
 op.
 Like
 we
 we
 don't
 know
 exactly


what
 the
 deal
 will
 consist
 of.
 So
 you


have
 green
 in
 financials,
 you
 have
 green


in
 healthcare,
 you
 have
 red
 in
 tech


outside
 of
 Google,
 Meta
 obviously


getting
 hit
 the
 worst
 now.
 Uh
 uh
 Adobe,


Salesforce,
 into
 it,
 Service
 Now,
 they


all
 had
 well
 Service
 Now
 had
 earnings
 it


was
 good,
 but
 all
 those
 are
 green.
 IBM's


green.
 Apple's
 up
 today.
 Amazon
 Tesla.


Wow.
 Amazon
 Tesla,
 Meta,
 Nvidia,


Microsoft
 are
 red.
 The
 only
 Mac
 7
 that's


green
 is
 Google.


The
 only
 Mac
 7
 that's
 green
 is
 Google.


Uh
 IBIT
 or
 Bitcoin
 ETF
 overall
 trading


volume
 surpassed
 a
 billion
 in
 the
 first


30
 minutes
 of
 trading
 today.
 So,
 we
 do


have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 trading
 more


Bitcoin.
 Uh
 Marjorie
 Taylor
 Green
 did


buy
 some
 more
 Bitcoin
 as
 was
 disclosed


yesterday.
 Bitcoin
 still
 down
 on
 the


day,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 a
 decent
 amount


amount
 of
 trading.


TSM
 going
 green,
 some
 of
 the
 semis
 going


green,
 but
 overall
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 MAG


7
 are
 red.
 And
 that's
 why
 the
 S&P
 is


red,
 right?
 Because
 they
 are
 the


majority
 of
 the
 MAG
 7.
 TSM
 right
 there


at
 306.


Where's
 the
 rare
 earth
 companies?
 Let's


see
 if
 they're
 doing
 okay.
 They
 are
 all


down.
 Not
 down
 as
 much.
 I
 mean
 they
 are


down
 a
 lot
 from
 where
 they
 were
 last


week.
 I
 mean
 the
 these
 were
 trades
 that


if
 people
 chased
 again
 they
 got
 they
 got


hit.
 TMQ
 is
 still
 up
 123%
 for
 the
 month


but
 you
 know
 it
 peaked
 out
 at
 around
 10


bucks.
 Now
 it's
 at
 470.
 So
 it's
 down


50%.


From
 those
 levels
 and
 the
 rare
 stuff


that
 you
 know
 Trump
 announced
 with
 China


was
 not
 bearish.
 You
 could
 say
 just


might
 mean
 not
 that
 much
 domestic
 demand


is
 needed.
 Google
 right
 here
 trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 the
 290.
 Rumble's
 running.


Rumble,


they
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 on


Rumble.


This
 one
 up
 about
 half
 a
 percent.
 Open


Door
 still
 down
 5%.


ESTs.32.


How
 about
 Lemonade?
 That
 had
 a
 bigger


day
 yesterday.
 Lemonade
 down
 2.7.


And
 then
 Amazon
 227.
 Okay,
 let
 me
 ask


this
 question
 in
 the
 chat.


Um,


let's
 do
 this.


Are
 you
 long
 Amazon
 or
 Apple


for
 earnings?
 Even
 if
 it's
 just
 an


earning
 play,


do
 you
 own
 Amazon
 or
 Apple?
 So,
 it's


Amazon,
 Apple,
 both
 or
 none.


I
 think
 there's
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 you


that
 have
 owned
 Apple
 for
 like
 years
 and


just
 never
 sold
 it.


But
 I
 do
 think
 more
 people
 are
 are
 long


Amazon.
 Yeah,
 we
 will
 have
 Coinbase,


Reddit,
 those
 companies
 also
 matter.
 I


just
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 expect
 out
 of


Coinbase
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 in
 Q3


well
 actually
 it'll
 be
 look
 Q3
 trading


volumes
 will
 be
 important
 to
 to
 signify


what
 happened
 with
 Robin
 Hood.
 But
 uh


Coinbase
 still
 has
 a
 lot
 more


institutional
 trading
 volume
 than
 retail


trading
 volume.


But
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 have
 been,
 you


know,
 not
 the
 most
 exciting
 story
 over


the
 past
 three
 months.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 sure


the
 trading
 volumes
 are
 going
 to
 be
 that


massive.
 Granted,
 we
 did
 get
 alltime


highs
 on
 both
 of
 those
 for
 a
 brief


moment
 in
 August,


but
 yeah,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 important


as
 well.
 And
 then
 Reddit,
 we're
 going
 to


see.


Did
 Trump
 post
 today?


Did
 he
 just
 post?
 Let's
 see.


Trump
 said
 Joe
 Biden
 should
 be
 in
 jail.


Okay,
 that's
 your
 uh
 that's
 your
 latest


post.


Biden
 is
 a
 criminal
 and
 should
 be
 in


jail.
 A
 major
 low
 life
 and
 failure.


Uh
 an
 ugly
 person
 both
 inside
 and
 out.
 I


beat
 him
 badly
 and
 love
 watching
 him


squirm
 now.


Okay,
 that's
 a
 little
 aggressive,


but
 all right,
 there
 you
 go.


I
 love
 watching
 him
 squirm
 now.


Okay.
 Well,


we
 go
 from
 China
 to
 uh
 to
 Biden.
 There


you
 go.
 China
 to
 Biden.
 Let's
 hear
 from


Ed
 Yard
 Denny.
 Get
 some
 of
 his
 thoughts


on
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 this
 market
 and
 uh


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Double
 digit
 growth
 rates
 on
 a


year-over-year
 basis.
 Uh
 and
 so
 I
 think


that's
 uh
 all
 very
 good
 for
 the
 market.


>> Yeah,
 certainly
 the
 big
 picture


continues
 to
 move
 in
 line
 with
 with


probably
 what
 the
 bulls
 would
 like
 to


see.
 Although
 I
 wonder
 just
 about
 the


some
 of
 the
 details,
 right?
 So
 the
 last


few
 days
 a
 lot
 more
 attention
 on
 how
 the


the
 rally
 had
 narrowed
 out
 again.


Semiconductors
 and
 some
 related
 stocks


really
 doing
 most
 of
 the
 work.
 Breath


measures
 not
 that
 great.
 And
 then
 I


guess
 the
 idea
 that
 maybe
 people
 had


started
 to
 chase
 a
 little
 bit


anticipating
 a
 strong
 finish
 to
 the


year.
 So
 I
 I
 guess
 tactically
 where


where
 do
 you
 put
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 you
 know
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 uh
 S&P
 500
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years


and
 average
 the
 year-to-ate
 percent


change.
 Uh
 what
 you
 find
 is
 that
 uh


year-to-
 date
 on
 average
 we've
 been
 up


8%
 and
 then
 in
 November
 December
 uh
 we


clocked
 another
 4%.
 So,
 we
 got
 up
 to
 a


12%


increase.
 And
 I
 think
 um
 investors
 are


expecting
 that
 kind
 of
 Santa
 Claus


rally.
 Uh
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 a
 Santa


Claus
 rally,
 I
 look
 at
 basically


November
 and
 December.
 And
 when
 you
 look


at
 it
 from
 that
 perspective,
 maybe
 we'll


get
 another
 4%
 increase
 in
 the
 S&P
 500,


which
 will
 handily
 get
 us
 to
 7,000
 on


the
 S&P
 500.
 Uh
 but
 as
 you
 said,
 there's


um
 a
 potential
 here
 for
 uh
 I
 think
 one


of
 your
 favorite
 words
 is
 a
 pullback


when
 things
 go
 down.
 That
 leaves
 a
 lot


lots
 of
 options
 of
 of
 how
 how
 much
 we


can
 go
 to
 the
 downside.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think


we
 could
 have
 pretty
 moderate
 pullback.


My
 my
 concern
 is
 sentiment
 is
 too


bullish.
 Everybody
 seems
 to
 be
 bullish


right
 now.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 take
 some
 of


that
 froth
 at least
 on
 a
 short-term


basis
 out
 of
 the
 market.
 And
 so
 I


wouldn't
 be
 surprised
 for
 the
 next


>> That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 we


did
 have
 a
 3%
 pullback
 already
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks,
 and
 that
 did
 get
 a


lot
 of
 froth
 out
 of
 the
 market.
 Uh,
 but


we're
 still
 at
 alltime
 highs.
 You
 can


make
 the
 argument
 that
 there's
 still
 be


there
 could
 still
 be
 some
 more
 potential


froth.
 Uh,
 option
 flow.
 Okay,
 we
 got


some
 things
 coming
 in.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this
 one.
 AMD.


Wow,
 someone
 just
 bought
 40
 million
 of


puts
 in
 a
 single
 transaction.


This
 is
 probably
 a
 hedge
 fund.
 240


January
 2026
 put


240
 January
 2026
 put


for
 AMD


damn
 40
 million
 25,000
 puts
 they
 paid620


they
 paid
 the
 exact
 ask
 price


to
 get
 access
 to
 those
 puts


I
 agree
 with
 what
 Suchin
 said
 yesterday


on
 AMD
 and
 Suchin
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 AMD
 and


we're
 talking
 about
 seven
 figures
 of
 AMD


and
 he
 said
 uh
 if
 Lisa
 Sue
 doesn't


increase
 guidance
 like
 Larry
 Ellison
 did


off
 the
 hopes
 and
 dreams
 of
 what
 the


opening
 partnership
 could
 do.
 This
 stock


is
 tanking
 because
 it's
 been
 giving
 a


lot
 of
 premium
 for
 no
 revenue
 growth,


just
 partnerships.
 They
 need
 to
 put
 into


their
 RPO.
 Even
 if
 it's
 not
 real
 yet,
 if


you
 want
 to
 keep
 the
 stock
 up,
 you
 got


to
 put
 into
 your
 RPO
 that
 OpenAI
 is


going to
 give
 you
 like
 80
 billion
 bucks


eventually
 to
 keep
 the
 street
 calm.
 And


Larry
 Ellison
 figured
 that
 out
 a
 while


ago.


It
 could
 be
 a
 protective
 put.
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 if
 it's
 a
 hedge
 fund
 obviously


could
 be
 very
 protective
 but


definitely
 something
 that
 I
 think


Lisa
 Sue
 needs
 to
 say
 again
 data
 center


growth
 is
 14%.
 So
 it's
 like
 it's
 not


impressive
 like
 it
 it
 has
 to
 increase


compared
 to
 Nvidia
 and
 it
 will
 it
 just


won't
 in
 the
 next
 two
 quarters
 because


opening
 I
 still
 has
 to
 build
 out
 these


data
 centers
 but
 if
 they
 can
 contract
 it


in
 their
 RPO
 I
 mean
 Oracle
 didn't
 have


fancy
 revenue
 growth
 but
 they
 had
 really


fancy
 RPO
 growth


and
 that's
 what
 got
 the
 street
 as


excited
 as
 they
 got
 when
 Oracle
 reported


a
 could
 you
 help
 me
 understand
 how
 we


have
 record
 numbers
 of
 money
 on
 the


sideline
 yet
 we
 are
 still
 shaking
 out


froth
 of
 sideline
 came
 in,
 wouldn't
 that


just
 be
 more
 froth?
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,


the
 sideline
 money
 when
 we
 think
 about


money
 market
 funds
 are
 people
 that
 just


want
 to
 not
 worry
 about
 taking
 risk.


Institutions
 and
 individual
 investors.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 say,
 "Hey,
 I'm


happy
 getting
 3.75%
 now.
 It's
 probably


three
 and
 a
 half%
 because
 we
 got
 the
 25


basis
 point
 cut."
 And
 we're
 not


interested
 in
 risk.
 The
 idea
 of
 money


coming
 out
 of
 money
 market
 funds
 is
 if


rates
 get
 so
 low
 to
 the
 point
 where
 the


risk
 premium
 of
 being
 in
 a
 money
 market


fund
 or
 the
 risk-free
 rate
 return
 of
 of


of
 being
 in
 a
 money
 market,
 the
 equity


risk
 premium
 of
 being
 in
 the
 stock


market,
 it
 becomes
 so
 bleak
 that
 you


have
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 of


a
 risk
 because
 your
 money
 is
 just


burning.
 One
 could
 say
 even
 to


inflation.
 If
 inflation
 stays
 at
 3%
 and


Trump
 gets
 us
 down
 to
 2
 and
 a
 half%,


you're
 literally
 losing
 money
 keeping
 it


in
 cash.
 The
 froth
 argument
 that
 Yard


Denny
 is
 talking
 about
 is
 more
 so
 money


that
 has
 been
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 that


has
 come
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that


don't
 really
 have
 earnings
 and
 they're


not
 showing
 earnings,
 but
 they're
 still


holding
 their
 multiple.
 And
 for
 the


companies
 that
 are
 showing
 their


earnings,
 you
 know,
 there's
 still


alltime
 highs.
 I
 mean
 look
 in
 I
 don't


think
 Nvidia
 203
 is
 necessarily
 frothy


when
 you
 look
 at
 multiples
 but
 to
 give


some
 context
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 I
 think


Yard
 Denny's
 kind
 of
 core
 point
 on
 why


there
 could
 be
 some
 level
 of
 froth
 um
 it


took
 Nvidia
 6,000
 days
 to
 reach
 a


trillion
 dollar
 market
 cap
 and
 then
 597


days
 to
 reach
 a
 5
 trillion
 market
 cap.


It
 took
 them
 200
 days
 in
 between
 four


trillion
 to
 get
 to
 five
 trillion.


I
 wouldn't
 necessarily
 say
 five
 trillion


is
 frothy
 when
 you
 look at
 the
 earnings


growth
 and
 you
 look
 at
 this
 $500
 billion


number
 over
 the
 next
 five
 quarters,
 but


my
 goodness,
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 $5
 trillion


company
 and
 it
 didn't
 take
 them
 that


long
 to
 get
 to
 5
 trillion
 after
 they
 got


to
 4
 trillion.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 estimates
 of
 Nvidia
 compared
 to


other
 countries,
 if
 you
 rank
 the


countries
 by
 market
 cap,
 the
 US
 is


number
 one,
 China's
 number
 two,
 Japan's


number
 three,
 Hong
 Kong's
 number
 three,


Nvidia
 is
 number
 four.
 It
 is
 5%
 away


from
 overtaking
 India's
 entire
 market


cap
 or
 entire
 GDP
 essentially.


So
 that's
 where
 you
 can
 make
 the


argument
 where
 look
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


money
 on
 the
 sidelines
 that
 will
 only


come
 out
 of
 the
 market
 money
 market


funds
 if
 there's
 actually
 a
 reason
 aka


rates
 come
 down
 enough
 you
 still
 have


companies
 that
 are
 you
 know
 up
 a
 lot


four
 5x
 this
 year
 and
 they
 don't
 have


any
 earnings
 and
 then
 you
 have
 a
 a
 a


company
 that
 is
 worth
 more
 than
 most


countries
 on
 the
 planet
 outside
 of
 the


big
 three


and
 that
 could
 be
 frothy
 even
 if
 when


you
 look
 under
 the
 hood


you
 know
 the
 numbers
 might
 suggest
 it's


not
 frothy
 but
 having
 said
 that
 that's


the
 same
 argument
 for
 the
 wall
 of
 worry


right
 like
 every
 time
 people
 say
 it's
 a


top
 the
 reason
 we
 continue
 to
 go
 higher


is
 because
 in
 my
 opinion
 there's
 so
 many


people
 ready
 to
 call
 the
 top
 people
 see


this
 Nvidia's
 worth
 more
 than
 uh
 India


news
 and
 they're
 like
 wow
 that's
 toppy


it's
 like
 yeah
 like
 the
 headline
 is


toppy
 I
 get
 it
 but
 then
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 numbers
 you
 look
 at
 what
 Jensen
 is


saying
 you
 look
 at
 the
 growth
 rates
 look


at
 the
 forward
 multiples
 it
 doesn't


become
 that
 toppy
 it
 becomes
 actually


quite
 reasonable
 and
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of


the
 reason
 we
 have
 all
 this
 fraud
 is


because
 of
 just
 the
 headlines
 of
 what


people
 think,
 but
 under
 the
 hood,
 it's


not
 exactly
 the
 same
 story.
 Apple
 right


there,
 270
 down
 from
 274,
 but
 that
 one's


still
 green.


My
 guess
 is
 7
 trillion
 will
 be
 deployed


in
 the
 next
 massive
 engineer
 drop
 in


2026.
 So,
 the
 money
 market
 funds,
 I


don't
 think
 we're
 ever
 going
 to
 lose


multiple
 trillions
 from
 the
 money
 market


funds.
 Uh,
 now
 on
 average,
 we
 have
 three


trillion,
 but
 that
 was
 in
 a
 0%
 interest


rate
 era.
 uh
 now
 that
 interest
 rates
 are


probably
 not
 going
 back
 to
 zero.
 We
 will


probably
 have
 more
 than
 three
 trillion.


I
 mean
 I
 would
 be
 shocked
 if
 over
 the


next
 couple
 years
 we
 have
 you
 know
 seven


trillion
 down
 to
 three
 trillion.
 My


guess
 is
 going
 to
 be
 similar
 to
 2009.


2009
 you
 had
 about
 565
 billion
 leave


money
 market
 funds
 and
 go
 into
 the
 stock


market
 when
 we
 bottomed
 in
 around


February.
 I'm
 thinking
 a
 similar
 thing


could
 happen.
 Maybe
 it's
 a
 trillion
 this


time
 because
 it's
 just
 law
 of
 big


numbers.


I
 think
 a
 couple
 hundred
 billion
 leaving


money
 market
 funds
 and
 going
 into
 the


markets
 if
 rates
 get
 attractive
 enough


is
 what
 you
 can
 expect.
 I
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 like
 three
 or
 four
 trillion
 coming


out
 unless
 Trump
 takes
 rates
 back
 down


to
 like
 1%.
 Maybe
 then


but
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 Chris.
 There
 would


have
 to
 be
 some
 type
 of
 drop
 in
 2026.


And
 by
 guys
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 drop
 in


26.
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 it's
 going to


happen.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 it's
 going to


happen.
 I
 don't know
 if
 it's
 S&P
 7000
 to


680.
 If
 it's
 7500
 to
 7,000,
 if
 it's,
 you


know,
 695
 to
 645,
 but
 there
 will
 be
 some


10%
 drop.
 Historically,
 since
 1950,


there
 has
 been
 at least
 a
 10%
 drop
 once


every
 single
 year.
 Meta
 right
 there
 at


664.
 So,
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 some
 cash
 on


the
 sidelines
 ready
 to
 buy
 that
 dip.
 The


question
 is
 why
 and
 how
 will
 it
 happen?


But
 eventually,
 it
 will.
 And
 I
 think
 the


question
 is
 just
 if
 companies
 keep


putting
 up
 earnings,
 then
 maybe


that
 drop
 is
 not
 going
 to
 matter
 as


much.


Yeah,
 January
 people
 could
 take
 profits,


people
 could
 sell
 for
 taxes,
 etc.


There
 could
 be
 another
 drop
 in
 December.


Yeah,
 there
 could
 be
 another
 drop
 in


December.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 we
 are
 entering


the
 best
 time
 of
 the
 year
 seasonally,


but
 nonetheless,
 this
 entire
 year
 has


been
 not
 exactly
 matching
 up
 to


historical
 precedence,
 so
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 see


how
 this
 plays
 out.


Uh,
 we
 will
 probably
 question
 AI
 again


next
 year.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 we'll
 probably


question
 AI
 again
 next
 year,
 but
 given


the
 capex
 guide
 we
 saw
 from
 Google,


Microsoft,
 Meta,


I
 mean,
 again,
 these
 guys
 are
 continuing


to
 spend
 for
 a
 reason.


And
 Google
 putting
 up
 the
 earnings
 that


they're
 putting
 up
 is
 at least
 one


company,
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 love


Microsoft
 or
 Meta's
 numbers,
 showing


that
 uh
 it's
 having
 a
 real
 ROI.
 I
 mean,


650
 million
 monthly
 Gemini
 users,
 that


was
 450
 million
 three
 months
 ago.
 If


they
 keep
 up
 at
 this
 point,
 they're


going
 to
 be
 at
 a
 billion
 by
 middle
 of


2026


and
 that
 would
 also
 be
 very
 very


exciting.


Grab
 still
 holding
 above
 $6.
 We
 got
 Grab


earnings
 on
 Monday.
 We're
 going
 to
 see


what
 Grab
 can
 do.
 Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 an


update
 on
 Grab.
 Go
 to
 their
 rival
 had


earnings
 in
 Indonesia
 yesterday.
 Uh
 I


went
 through
 the
 earnings
 and
 I
 looked


at
 it.
 From
 my
 understanding,
 everything


that
 Goto
 reported
 should
 be
 very


bullish
 for
 grab.
 They
 increased
 IBIDA


estimates,
 free
 cash
 flow
 positive,


profitable,
 etc.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 Goto
 and


Grab,
 their
 businesses
 are
 actually
 very


similar,
 especially
 how
 they
 report


their
 numbers.
 Like,
 if
 you
 literally
 go


through
 their
 slide
 decks,
 it's
 almost


like
 a
 carbon
 copy
 of
 both
 because,
 you


know,
 they're
 both
 foreign
 companies


that
 are
 trying
 to
 appeal
 to
 American


investors.
 So,
 it's
 a
 very
 similar
 kind


of
 aesthetic
 appeal.
 And
 I
 think
 Grab
 is


going
 to
 have
 the
 exact
 same
 quarter,


but
 I
 think
 they're
 going to
 raise
 their


estimates
 by
 more
 than
 what
 go
 did.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 that
 should
 be


beneficial
 for
 them.
 But
 the
 fact
 that


Indonesia
 is
 booming
 in
 the
 ride


hailing,
 delivery,
 fintech
 ecosystem,


you
 know,
 Grab
 is
 in
 Indonesia
 plus


eight
 other
 countries.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


I
 think
 I
 think
 we
 should
 get
 a
 good
 Q3.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 Monday.
 We're
 going


to
 see
 what
 happens.
 Aid,
 do
 you
 think


the
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 thing
 could


happen
 with
 Amazon?
 You're
 talking
 about


the
 tax
 credit.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 what
 exactly
 happened
 in
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill
 that
 caused
 Meta
 to
 take


this
 $15
 billion
 charge
 off
 because
 none


of
 the
 other
 tech
 companies
 had
 that


charge
 off.
 My
 understanding
 is
 that


Meta
 delayed
 tax
 payments
 on
 an


investment
 that
 they
 didn't
 fully


recognize.
 And
 then
 as
 for
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 write


off
 data
 centers,
 they
 had
 other


investments
 that
 they
 had
 to
 finally


recognize
 which
 means
 they
 have
 to
 pay


taxes
 on.
 Could
 that
 happen
 to
 Amazon?
 I


have
 no
 clue.
 Like
 I
 genuinely
 have
 no


idea.
 If
 it
 does,
 Amazon's
 probably


gonna
 have
 a
 knee-jerk
 reaction
 to
 the


downside.


But
 I'm
 thinking
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 meta


thing,
 especially
 because
 they
 made


different
 investments
 that
 caused
 them


to
 uh


to
 to
 recognize
 that
 issue,


but
 I
 could
 be
 wrong.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 see
 after
 the
 close.


Um,


what
 happened
 to
 the
 go-to
 fraud


situation?
 That
 is
 still
 there.
 I
 mean


the
 the
 the
 original
 founders
 and
 some


of
 the
 executives
 have
 been
 you
 know


dealing
 with
 that
 controversy
 but
 that


that's
 not
 stopped
 the
 actual
 company


from
 you
 know
 continuing
 to
 execute
 as
 a


company
 in
 the
 region
 but
 look
 that


controversy
 is
 not
 there
 caused
 a
 lot
 of


protests
 caused
 a
 lot
 of
 brand
 sentiment


damage
 and
 so
 you
 know
 that
 is
 something


that
 could
 also
 be
 a
 tailwind
 for
 the


competitors
 in
 the
 region.
 Oh
 wow
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 core
 scientific


shareholders
 reject
 the
 core
 merger.


Wow.
 The
 deal
 failed
 to
 secure
 the


required
 votes.
 We
 talked
 about
 this
 a


couple
 months
 ago
 when
 Cororee
 tried
 to


buy
 them
 out.
 Uh


this
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 like
 what
 a
 $9


billion
 deal.
 Corre
 down
 3.5%
 right


here.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 didn't
 like
 the


offer
 that
 Cororee
 made
 and
 as
 a
 result


shareholders
 are
 explaining
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 allow
 it
 to
 happen.


There
 you
 go.
 Gets
 rejected.


similar
 to
 uh
 Adobe
 and
 Figma
 a
 while


ago.
 Well,
 no,
 that
 was
 more
 legal
 with


the
 European
 regulators.
 This
 is
 more


shareholders,
 but


that
 might
 leave
 Core
 Scientific
 to


continue
 being
 a
 public
 company
 on
 its


own.


Hims,
 where's
 HIMS
 4646?
 Hims
 continues


to
 stay
 below
 50.


Hims
 continues
 to
 stay
 below
 50.


What
 do
 people
 think?
 Do
 do
 we
 think


we're
 super
 frothy
 here
 at
 these
 levels?


S&P
 684,
 Nvidia
 2011.
 I
 mean,
 if
 if if


you
 had
 to
 say
 frothy
 or
 not
 frothy,
 put


in
 the
 chat.
 Are
 people
 thinking
 we're


frothy?
 We
 just
 went
 through
 a
 3%
 draw


down.
 We
 obviously
 have
 had
 a
 pretty


good
 recovery
 as
 we're
 hitting
 all-time


highs.
 Uh
 earnings,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 every


day
 it
 looks
 like
 you're
 beating
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom
 from
 every
 company.


Is
 this
 FE
 the
 all
 the
 unprofitable


companies
 they
 all
 fell
 by
 30%
 over
 the


past
 two
 weeks


that
 you
 know
 you
 got
 some
 of
 that
 money


out
 of
 the
 system.


Yeah,
 let's
 do
 a
 poll
 on
 it.
 I
 see
 a
 lot


more
 not
 frothy
 than
 frothy.
 Uh
 by
 the


way,
 50%
 of
 you
 are
 long
 Amazon,
 9%
 are


long
 Apple,
 14%
 both,
 27%
 none.
 So


majority
 of
 people
 here
 long
 Amazon.


Okay.
 Are
 we
 frothy?


That
 is
 in
 the
 chat.


Um


876,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Take


a
 look
 at
 CNBM
 after
 Starlink


announcement.
 It's
 done
 900%.
 Yeah,
 we


saw
 that
 yesterday.
 I
 mean,
 that
 was


crazy,
 but
 uh
 wow,
 it's
 up
 another
 100%


today.
 $176
 million
 market
 cap.
 Starlink


partnered
 with
 them.
 as
 stocks
 up
 now
 a


thousand
 percent
 this
 week.
 Now,
 I
 don't


know if
 people
 are
 just
 chasing
 it,
 if


it's
 up
 another
 111%.
 But
 yesterday
 up


4x


that
 seemed
 to
 be
 based
 on
 that
 uh
 that


announcement.


Uh
 Feds,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 In
 celebration
 of
 this
 glorious


day,
 I
 want
 you
 to
 buy
 one
 share
 of


pound
 on
 me.
 200
 never
 felt
 so
 good.
 You


were
 there
 the
 whole
 way
 and
 deserve
 the


success,
 man.
 Congrats
 to
 you
 as
 well.


Fats,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 when
 we
 get
 to


200,
 I
 will
 definitely
 buy
 that
 share
 uh


at
 $200.
 But
 it
 was
 pretty
 cool
 to
 see


that
 yesterday
 and
 and
 pretty
 epic


together.
 I
 I
 also
 got
 a
 picture
 from


Chad
 at
 GTC.
 You
 know, when
 Chad
 came
 on


the
 show
 yesterday
 and
 he
 was


he
 was
 explaining
 the
 Nvidia
 Nvidia


Palunteer
 partnership
 at
 GTC
 when
 they


were
 demoing
 AIP
 in
 in
 Nvidia.


Someone
 was
 watching


the
 market
 open
 there.
 That
 was
 crazy.


So
 there's
 me
 and
 Chad
 on
 the
 screen
 as


they're
 demoing


AIP
 at
 GTC.


So
 pretty
 pretty
 cool
 from
 yesterday.


Nvidia
 right
 there
 down
 2.4%
 than
 the


S&P
 down
 about
 half
 a
 percent.
 Rob,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Admit
 OpenAI


believes
 they
 will
 be
 worth
 one
 trillion


next
 year.
 Do
 you
 think
 that's
 possible?


And
 if
 so,
 could
 that
 affect
 pounders


valuation?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


OpenAI
 is
 going
 to
 have
 an
 actual
 IPO


that
 gets
 valued
 at
 a
 trillion.
 to
 be


honest,
 it
 could
 be
 even
 more
 than
 a


trillion
 based
 on
 the
 demand
 for
 the


IPO.
 For
 pounder,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 pounder


is
 pushing
 500
 billion.
 Obviously,
 the


valuation
 is
 up
 there.
 Uh,
 one
 could


argue
 that
 OpenAI
 not
 being
 profitable


means
 that
 Paler
 should
 be
 worth
 even


more
 given
 that
 they're
 profitable
 and


they're
 actually
 creating
 meaningful
 use


cases.
 It's
 just
 a
 question
 of
 what


OpenAI's
 revenue
 growth
 looks
 like.


Palunteer
 will
 grow
 probably
 50%.


Hopefully
 50%
 next
 year
 as
 well.
 OpenAI


is
 thinking
 of
 growing
 like
 two
 300%.
 So


the
 question
 is
 going
 to
 be
 what
 does


the
 growth
 trajectory
 look
 like
 and
 can


they
 get
 to
 free
 co
 free
 cash
 flow


positive
 with
 adjusted
 ebida
 positivity


by
 2027.


But
 yes
 if
 openi
 goes
 public
 I
 think
 it


will
 affect
 every
 AI
 company


that
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 that
 is
 seen
 as
 a


company
 in
 the
 broader
 sector


like
 a
 trillion
 when's
 we
 I
 don't
 think


we've
 had
 the
 last
 time
 we
 had
 a


trillion
 dollar
 IPO
 was
 Saudi
 Aramco.
 I


don't
 think
 we've
 ever
 had
 a
 trillion


dollar
 IPO
 in
 the
 tech
 sector.
 I
 think


the
 other
 one
 besides
 that
 was
 Baba.


That
 was
 like
 250
 billion
 or
 something,


but
 that
 would
 be
 the
 largest
 IPO
 in


history.
 Tesla,
 by
 the
 way,
 getting
 hit


3.65%.


Tesla
 getting
 a
 4%
 hit
 right
 here.


Bitcoin
 still
 107


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 down.


Aid,
 I
 had
 the
 market
 open
 on
 in
 the


bedroom
 this
 morning
 and
 my
 wife
 had


pound
 her
 200.
 She's
 still
 pissed
 at
 me


for
 those
 $25
 covered
 calls.


It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 was
 actually
 talking


to
 someone
 yesterday
 or
 not
 yesterday,


it
 was
 a
 week
 ago.
 He
 had
 32,000
 shares


of
 Palunteer
 and
 uh
 he
 had
 covered
 calls


at
 35
 and
 when
 Paler
 got
 to
 35,
 he
 was


like,
 "Oh,
 it'll
 fall
 down.
 Then
 it
 gets


to
 40."
 He's
 like, "It'll
 fall
 down."


Then
 it
 gets
 to
 50.
 Then
 he's
 like,
 he


rolled
 it
 to
 37.
 He's
 like,
 "It'll
 come


back
 down."
 I
 remember
 35
 to
 37.
 It
 just


got
 called
 away
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 All


of
 them,
 all
 the
 shares
 at
 37
 bucks.


He
 had
 32,000
 shares,
 bro.


It
 was
 He
 was
 just
 like,
 "Yeah,
 bro.


That
 was
 uh
 that
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


mistake."
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 that
 one


sucks."
 And
 he
 could
 have
 saved
 it
 like


even
 it
 when
 pounds
 was
 at
 7080.
 He


could
 have
 paid
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 debit
 and


rolled
 it
 and
 and
 gotten
 at
 least
 like


130,
 140,
 you
 know,
 and
 then
 when
 it
 got


there,
 he
 could
 have
 had
 an
 opportunity


in
 August
 because
 we
 fell
 to
 140,
 could


have
 managed
 it,
 rolled
 it
 up
 to
 190.


But
 he
 just
 kept
 thinking
 it
 would
 come


back
 and
 it
 just
 didn't.


That's
 what
 happens.


It
 happens
 in
 different
 situations.
 VIX


over
 17.
 All right.
 So
 now
 the
 VIX
 going


a
 bit
 more
 green.
 There
 you
 go.
 VIX


going
 green.
 So
 below
 30
 again.
 S&P
 are


we
 below?
 We
 are
 not
 below
 the
 940
 level


at
 681.


We're
 at
 683.


Um,


I
 did
 that
 in
 Tesla
 in
 2019.


Dude,
 I
 was
 buying
 freaking
 Tesla
 in


2019
 as
 a
 dumb
 college
 kid.
 I
 remember


seeing
 it
 get
 to
 like
 I
 don't
 know what


the
 postsplit
 adjusted
 price
 is,
 but
 it


was
 one
 I
 bought
 it
 at
 170
 back
 in
 2019.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 is
 post
 adjusted


split,
 but


uh
 then
 I
 sold
 when
 I
 got
 to
 300.
 I


thought
 I
 made
 money.


Should
 have
 held.
 Should
 have
 held.


BMR,
 what's
 going
 on
 there?
 BMR
 is
 at


4729.


4729.


Did
 that
 too
 in
 Meta
 in
 2022?
 No.


Sigma's
 down
 17%.


Goodness
 gracious.
 What
 the
 heck?


This
 is
 another
 healthc
 care
 company.


Did
 they
 have
 earnings
 today?
 Sigma


17.


Yeah.


Uh,


looks
 like
 guidance
 is
 intact.


They
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.


Um,


there's
 a
 couple
 of
 issues
 with
 their


pharmacy
 benefit
 services
 segment


and
 on
 the
 earnings
 call,
 they
 didn't


reaffirm
 their
 guidance
 or
 they
 didn't


reaffirm
 their
 operating
 margin


guidance.


That's
 probably
 why
 UNH
 was
 taking
 a
 hit


in
 the
 morning.
 There
 you
 go.
 Sigma
 down


17%
 on
 the
 day.
 UNH
 down
 3%
 as
 well.


Same
 with
 Bax
 that's
 down
 16%.


Baxter
 down
 15.


Another
 healthcare.
 Dude,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


healthcare
 names


not
 been
 able
 to
 hold
 on
 even
 though


Oh,
 Sprouts
 Farmers
 Market.
 That
 one


also
 got
 hit.


Yeah,
 25%.
 This
 one
 just
 was
 like,


again,
 this
 is
 the
 part
 of
 earnings
 so


far
 that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 most
 weak,
 which


is
 uh
 these
 consumer
 companies,
 grocery


stores,
 restaurant
 chains


that
 are
 showing
 declining
 margins
 and


missing


on
 EPS
 guidance.
 Now,
 granted,
 if
 you


look
 at
 this
 chart
 right
 here,
 Sprouts


was
 trading
 at
 40
 times
 next
 12
 months


earnings.
 So,
 you
 can't
 say
 it
 wasn't
 a


little
 bit
 expensive.
 I
 mean,
 2024
 was
 a


massive
 year
 for
 this
 company.
 It's
 down


40%
 this
 year,
 whereas
 in
 2024,
 it
 was


up
 almost
 100%.


But
 that
 stock
 took
 a
 hit.
 That
 stock


and
 Chipotle


took
 an
 ugly
 hit.


Oaklo
 is
 up
 about
 half
 a
 percent.
 Again,


there


got
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 nuclear
 stocks
 excited.


Yeah,
 core
 scientific
 announces
 termin


ter
 termination
 of
 major
 gum
 with
 core


reef.
 So
 that's
 official
 now.


That
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 happening.


And
 then
 Nvidia
 still
 down
 2.23%.


Uh
 macro
 stat
 right
 here.
 US
 luxury
 home


prices
 rose
 4.8%
 year-over-year
 in


September
 to
 a
 record
 1.26
 million,
 more


than
 double
 the
 1.8%
 an
 8%
 rise
 for


non-luxury
 homes,
 which
 reached
 a
 median


of
 371,000.
 Since
 last
 year,
 luxury


prices
 are
 up
 about
 11%
 versus
 6%
 for


standard
 homes.
 Wealthy
 buyers
 often


paying
 in
 cash
 with
 small
 loans,
 aren't


waiting
 for
 low
 rates.
 They're
 confident


in
 using
 real
 estate
 as
 a
 stable


investment
 amid
 economic
 uncertainty.


Again,
 more
 bifurcation


of
 this
 economy.
 You
 know,
 someone


actually
 asked
 JPAL
 yesterday
 that


question.


Someone
 asked
 JPA,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 the


last
 question.


uh
 they
 asked
 them,
 hey,
 do
 you
 think


the
 stock
 market
 is
 the
 reason
 why


consumer
 spending
 hasn't
 gone
 down?


Because
 people
 who
 are
 wealthy
 are
 able


to
 keep
 spending


and


uh
 people,
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 stock
 market


were
 to
 go
 down,
 that
 would
 essentially


collapse
 any
 of
 the
 spending
 that
 we've


seen.


The
 question
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be,
 you


know,
 if
 that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 here


is
 the
 uh


the
 question
 that
 was


that
 was
 asked
 there


>> to
 the
 financial
 system
 or
 the
 outlook


for
 the
 economy.
 Is
 it
 a
 warning
 sign?


>> So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 we're
 obviously
 we


watch
 this
 these
 things
 very
 carefully,


credit
 conditions
 very
 carefully.
 You're


right.
 You've
 seen
 rising
 defaults
 in


subprime
 credit
 for
 some
 time
 now.
 And


now
 you've
 seen
 a
 number
 of
 of
 subprime


credit
 uh
 h
 automobile
 credit
 uh


institutions
 having
 s
 significant
 losses


and
 some
 of
 those
 losses
 are
 now
 showing


up
 on
 the
 books
 books
 of
 banks.
 You
 know


we're
 we're
 looking
 at
 it
 carefully.


We're
 paying
 close
 attention.
 Uh
 I
 don't


see
 at
 this
 point
 a
 broader
 credit


issue.
 It
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 something


that
 that
 has
 uh
 very
 broad
 application


across
 financial
 institutions,
 but
 you


know,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 we're
 going
 to


be
 monitoring
 this
 quite
 carefully
 and


uh
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 that
 is
 the


case.


>> And
 then
 separately,
 um
 many
 you


yourself
 have
 said
 that
 we're
 in
 a


bifurcated
 economy
 right
 now
 with
 high


netw
 worth
 individuals
 continuing
 to


spend
 with
 the
 lower
 income
 pulling


back.
 How
 much
 of
 consumer
 spending


continuing
 hinges
 on
 the
 stock
 market


remaining
 strong?
 In
 some
 odd
 way,
 does


the
 market
 help
 keep
 the
 economy


buoyant?


>> So
 there
 there
 is
 some
 there's
 some


relationship
 there,
 but
 remember
 uh
 the


more
 wealth
 someone
 has,
 the
 lower
 an


additional
 dollar
 of
 wealth
 matters.
 So


your
 marginal
 propensity
 to
 consume


declines
 quite
 dramatically
 as
 you
 reach


as
 you
 reach
 levels
 of
 stock
 market


wealth.
 So,
 you
 know,
 the
 stock
 market,


it
 it
 would
 affect
 spending
 if
 the
 stock


market
 went
 down,
 but
 it
 wouldn't
 drop


it
 wouldn't
 drop
 sharply
 unless
 there


were
 quite
 a
 sharp
 drop
 in
 the
 um
 you


know,
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 I
 didn't


fully
 love
 the
 answer
 from
 JPAL
 because


when
 he
 says
 your
 marginal
 propensity
 to


consume
 goes
 down
 as
 you
 get
 more


wealthy,
 it's
 like
 yeah,
 technically


like
 from
 an
 academic
 perspective
 that


makes
 sense.
 But
 I
 mean,
 people
 continue


to
 spend.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,


luxury
 home
 prices,
 the
 only
 reason


they're
 up
 5%
 year-over-year
 is
 because


there's
 demand
 for
 it.
 And
 even
 if
 you,


you
 know,
 you
 can't
 buy
 everything
 in


the
 world,
 the
 more
 money
 you
 have,
 the


more
 money
 you're
 going
 to
 try
 to


invest.
 So,
 at
 the
 end,
 when
 he
 admits


that,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 stock
 market


were
 to
 have
 a
 major
 decline,
 that
 would


create
 a
 major
 sense
 of
 weakness.
 I


think
 that's
 objectively
 true.
 It's
 like


if
 But
 now,
 granted,
 what
 is
 a
 major


decline?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Is
 that
 10%,
 20%,


15%?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Uh,
 it's
 probably


not
 5%.
 It
 would
 have
 to
 be
 at least


upwards
 of
 10%.
 But
 you
 would
 need
 to


see
 some
 some
 reckoning
 in
 the
 market


for
 people
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 can't
 afford


to
 buy
 a
 1.26
 million
 house
 by
 taking
 a


margin
 loan
 against
 my
 Nvidia."


Until
 we
 see
 that,
 you
 might
 have


wealthy
 people
 continue
 to
 spend
 and


that
 prop
 up
 the
 economy.
 And
 then
 the


layoff
 picture
 gets
 also
 very
 confusing,


right?
 Because
 it's
 like
 again
 a
 lot
 of


these
 tech
 workers
 that
 were
 making
 nice


tech
 salaries
 at
 these
 white
 collar


jobs,
 if
 they're
 not
 getting
 paid
 the


tech
 salaries
 they
 were
 getting
 paid,


are
 they
 buying
 a
 $17


sandwich


in
 San
 Francisco
 for
 lunch?
 Like
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 went
 to
 San
 Francisco
 a


couple
 months
 ago.
 The
 those
 sandwiches


are
 kind
 of
 expensive
 and
 then
 it's
 like


an
 $8
 latte
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 It's
 like
 it's


almost
 30
 bucks
 for
 like
 a
 sandwich
 and


a
 drink.
 It's
 like
 it's
 you
 got
 to
 have


a
 have
 to
 have
 a
 good
 salary
 to
 be
 able


to
 take
 on
 that
 purchase.
 And
 if
 you're


not
 getting
 paid
 like
 that,
 you're
 not


going
 to
 buy
 that
 stuff.


So,
 I
 think
 there
 there
 still
 is
 this


bifrocated
 view
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 we're


not
 officially
 sure
 exactly
 what's


happening.
 17
 is
 cheap.
 I
 paid
 33
 for


three
 pancakes
 in
 San
 Francisco.


Dude,
 it
 pains
 me
 when
 I
 have
 to
 pay
 for


food.
 Especially
 if
 the
 food's
 not
 good,


bro.
 The
 food's
 really
 good.
 It's
 like


you
 can
 justify
 it.
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I
 I


ironically
 I
 went
 to
 a
 pancake
 shop
 the


other
 day
 near
 the
 the
 the
 the
 new
 place


that
 I
 I
 moved
 to
 and
 I
 was
 just
 testing


it
 out
 because
 I
 was
 like,
 "Is
 this
 a


spot
 that
 I
 want
 to
 come
 to?
 This
 is
 a


place
 that
 I
 want
 to
 bring
 people
 to."


And
 the
 pancakes
 were
 horrible.
 And
 it


was
 kind
 of
 expensive,
 too.
 And
 I
 was


like, "All
 right,
 that's
 a
 lesson
 for
 me


to
 never
 go
 back
 to
 the
 spot.
 I'm
 gonna


I'm
 going
 to
 psychologically
 justify
 it


as,
 hey,
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 lesson
 that
 I


learn.
 I
 have
 to
 pay
 to
 learn
 that


lesson."
 But
 it
 still
 stings
 because


when
 you
 pay
 that
 much,
 you
 like


expect
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 return.


No,
 it's
 not
 IHOP.
 It's
 like
 a
 local


pancake
 shop.
 It's
 not
 just
 pancake.


They
 sell
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 things,


but
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 known
 for
 their


pancakes.
 And
 then
 I
 eat
 the
 pancakes.


I'm
 like,
 bro,
 these
 are
 trash.
 Like


these
 are
 like
 IHOP
 is
 better
 than
 this.


This
 This
 feels
 like
 I
 made
 these


pancakes.
 Like
 this.
 They're
 not
 even


fluffy.
 It's
 like
 what's
 going
 on
 here?


Crowd
 strike
 545.
 That
 one
 not
 getting


weak
 either.
 Is
 that
 one
 holding
 up?


But
 yeah,
 dude,
 this
 bifurcated
 economy


thing,
 we
 cannot
 ignore
 it
 as
 investors


because
 it
 affects
 everybody
 and
 it


could
 be
 the
 thing
 that
 comes
 up
 in
 26


that
 people
 might
 not
 be
 expecting
 if


the
 layoffs
 get
 worse.
 VIX,
 by
 the
 way,


back
 down
 to
 red
 or
 at least
 close
 to


red.
 I
 ran
 back
 to
 60.


I
 definitely
 think
 it's
 something
 that


we
 have
 to
 figure
 out.


Um,


NYC
 salad
 are
 20
 to
 26.
 Yes,
 that's
 also


true.
 I
 mean,
 NYC
 salads
 are
 stupid
 as


well.
 Laura
 says,
 "I
 still
 eat
 at
 Whole


Foods."
 Look,
 Whole
 Foods
 is
 not


horrible.
 I've
 eaten
 at
 Whole
 Foods


before.
 It's
 not
 bad
 at
 all,
 but
 Whole


Foods
 can
 get
 a
 little
 expensive
 as


well.
 Universal
 Music
 Group
 has
 signed
 a


deal
 with
 artificial
 intelligence
 music


generator
 UDIO
 to
 launch
 a
 new
 platform


trained
 on
 licensed
 songs,
 the
 company


said.


All right.
 AI
 music


I
 guess
 AI
 music
 is
 not
 uh
 slowing
 down.


There
 is
 a
 company
 that's
 doing
 about


150
 million
 ARR


uh
 and
 they're
 an
 AI
 music
 generator.
 So


you
 are
 seeing
 more


of
 an
 ecosystem
 play
 on
 what
 we're


getting
 for
 for
 AI
 and
 music.
 Uh


remember
 that
 politician
 who
 bought
 Big


Bear
 AI,
 Lisa
 Mlan?
 She
 bought
 another


50,000
 of
 it
 on
 July
 10th.
 She
 forgot
 to


disclose,
 quote
 unquote,
 forgot.
 Uh,
 the


CEO
 of
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 is
 Trump's
 ex-


secretary
 of
 Homeland
 Security
 and


according
 to
 multiple
 sources,
 the


majority
 of
 the
 revenue
 comes
 from


government
 contracts.
 She's
 also
 the


first
 politician
 to
 buy
 Big
 Bear
 AI.
 She


now
 has
 bought
 a
 100
 grand
 of
 Big
 Bear


AI
 and
 she
 will
 be
 fined
 $200
 for
 not


disclosing
 that
 she
 bought
 it
 back
 then.


Now,
 again,
 the
 actual
 fundamentals
 on


the
 stock,
 they're
 growing
 negative


32.5%.


However,
 politician
 buying
 it
 means


maybe
 there's
 some
 contracts
 down
 the


road
 that
 she
 knows
 about
 and
 know
 that


could
 be
 a
 catalyst
 potentially
 for
 this


one
 as
 well.


But
 she
 did
 own
 about
 100%
 of
 this.
 PRM


had
 earnings
 today.
 They're
 up
 20%.


Perimeter
 Solutions,
 $4
 billion
 company,


provision
 of
 global
 solutions
 for
 fire


safety
 and
 specialty
 products.


Okay,
 I
 do
 not
 know
 about
 this
 one,
 but


seems
 like
 a
 smaller
 company.
 Wow,
 108%


year-to-
 date.
 It's
 always
 cool
 to
 see


those
 smaller
 names
 that
 people
 don't


care
 about
 too
 much,
 but
 if
 you,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 Amcor
 is
 Amcore
 is
 a
 7


billion
 company,
 right?
 Amcore
 could
 be


one
 of
 them
 in
 26
 if
 they
 continue
 their


momentum.


Looks
 like
 this
 one
 had
 a
 pretty
 good


earnings
 and
 that
 stock
 right
 here
 up


24%


on
 the
 day.


Um,
 where
 is
 Andos
 drone
 company?
 Let's


see.
 That
 one's
 down.
 Is
 Redcat
 down?
 We


talked
 to
 Jeff
 Thomas
 yesterday,
 CEO
 of


Redcat.
 Redcat's
 also
 down.
 All
 right,


so
 all
 the
 drone
 companies
 taking
 a


little
 hit.
 Is
 Meta
 still
 holding
 670?


No,
 Meta
 right
 back
 to
 660.


Okay,
 guys.
 Is
 Meta
 a
 buy?
 Is
 it
 a
 buy


here
 at
 660?


The
 lows
 of
 the
 day
 was
 651,
 right?


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 at
 least
 a
 nibble.


Feel
 like
 it's
 a
 nibble.


It's
 definitely
 still
 weak.
 That
 dude


that
 25
 that
 25
 billion
 bond
 thing
 came


out
 of
 nowhere.
 I
 I
 didn't
 that
 is
 fresh


debt.
 They
 didn't
 announce
 that
 on
 the


earnings
 yesterday.
 They
 say
 they
 were


taking
 out
 25
 billion
 in
 debt.


I
 mean
 that
 complicates
 things
 a
 little


bit.


But
 the
 multiples
 are
 still
 pretty


cheap.


Doesn't
 feel
 the
 most
 expensive.
 Let's


get
 a
 Gene
 Monsters
 perspective


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


margin
 2024
 revenue
 growth
 about
 23%

 about
 8%.
 The
 first
 uh


two
 quarters
 of
 this
 year

 22%
 expense

 12%.
 They
 report


their
 September
 quarter
 with
 23%

growth
 but
 expense

 of
 32%.
 And


throwing
 insult
 onto
 that
 is
 the


commentary
 about
 the
 third
 party
 capex


spend
 for
 next
 year
 and
 this
 aggressive


is
 the
 word
 that
 they're
 spending


substantial
 increase
 expenses
 related
 to


that.
 We're
 probably
 going
 to
 see


something
 like
 18%
 revenue
 growth
 for


next
 year
 for
 the
 top
 line.
 the
 streets


at
 16
 right
 now,
 but
 probably
 18%
 and


probably
 expenses
 growing
 north
 of
 30%.


And
 so
 essentially
 the
 script
 that
 we've


seen
 with
 Meta
 over
 the
 past
 two
 years


got
 flipped.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 that


simple.
 Uh
 if
 you
 look
 across
 the
 board


at
 Zuck's
 ambition
 around
 AI,
 what
 he's


trying
 to
 accomplish,
 look
 at
 their


engagement,
 I
 mean
 just
 like
 profound


engagement
 growth,
 accelerating


engagement
 growth.
 43%
 of
 the
 world
 uses


their
 products
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 Those


rate
 of
 usage
 is
 accelerating.
 So
 it
 was


a
 great
 quarter
 with
 the
 exception
 of


that
 dynamic,
 Melissa,
 and
 I
 think
 it


really
 stung
 investors.


>> You
 know,
 Jean,
 um
 this
 is
 one
 again
 uh


I
 saw
 your
 notes
 earlier,
 you're
 kind
 of


confounded.
 Microsoft
 similarly.
 Um,
 you


know,
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 down
 tick
 in


earnings
 growth
 though
 for
 2026
 for


Meta,
 I
 mean,
 isn't
 that
 the
 sort
 of


thing
 that
 you
 would
 probably
 expect
 for


the
 stock
 that's
 outperformed
 pretty


dramatically
 um,
 you
 know,
 over
 the
 last


two
 years
 or
 so
 to
 kind
 of
 take
 a
 pause?


>> Well,
 a
 pause
 is
 understandable,
 but
 I


think
 that
 that
 that
 shift,
 that
 expense


shift,
 that
 was
 something
 new.
 Like
 a


pause
 to
 me
 is
 they've
 got
 good
 numbers.


They
 beat
 the
 numbers.
 that
 onetime


charge
 that
 people
 are
 talking
 about


that
 $15
 million
 tax
 charge
 that
 was


that's
 a
 nothing
 just
 throw
 it
 out


doesn't
 matter
 but
 so
 I
 I
 I
 think
 Dan


that
 it's
 um
 I'm
 trying
 to
 look
 at
 like


what
 was
 incremental
 I
 could
 understand


if
 the
 stock
 was
 down
 3%
 on
 good
 news


that's
 to
 me
 taking
 a
 breather
 but
 down


8
 n
 10%
 uh
 investors
 are
 trying
 to
 to
 to


just
 recalibrate
 I
 think
 something


bigger
 and
 again
 that
 dynamic
 around
 uh


them
 going
 more
 to
 cloud
 now
 I'd
 also


point
 out
 like
 around
 the
 ambitions
 and


around
 AI
 and
 and
 I'm
 all
 in
 on
 this


being
 uh
 more
 transformative
 than
 where


I
 think
 high
 expectations
 are,
 but
 Zuck


basically
 is
 setting
 himself
 up
 to
 be


the
 most
 optimistic
 of
 any
 of
 the
 big


tech
 CEOs
 as
 evidenced
 by
 their
 increase


in
 capex.
 So,
 it's
 going to
 be
 up
 the


street's
 looking
 for
 40%
 growth
 right


now
 for
 26.
 Uh
 they're
 they
 didn't
 give


detailed
 guidance
 around
 that,
 but
 it's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 up
 more
 than
 60%.


It
 seems
 like
 again,
 I
 think
 Gan
 is


right.
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 the
 street
 is


upset.
 Like
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 guidance


on
 how
 aggressive
 this
 notable
 quote


unquote
 capex


um
 increase
 is
 going to
 be
 in
 26
 and


that's
 why
 Meta
 is
 getting
 hit.


But
 again,
 like
 it's
 so
 weird
 because


it's
 like
 the
 street
 wants
 these
 these


guys
 to
 spend
 money
 now.
 They
 want
 the


ROI,
 but
 the
 street's
 not
 stupid.
 Like


Nvidia
 is
 worth
 five
 trillion
 because


there's
 a
 handful
 of
 companies
 that
 can


buy
 their
 product.
 Meta
 is
 one
 of
 like


10
 companies
 outside
 of
 the
 sovereign


nations
 that
 actually
 has
 the
 money


whether
 it's
 in
 the
 debt
 markets
 or
 the


free
 cash
 flow
 to
 buy
 Nvidia
 GPUs.
 So


it's
 so
 weird
 for
 the
 streets
 to
 be
 like


well
 Nvidia
 should
 go
 to
 5
 trillion
 but


the
 reason
 it's
 going
 to
 5
 trillion
 aka


a
 hyperscaler
 spending
 as
 much
 money
 uh


as
 necessary
 that's
 needed
 to
 justify


five
 trillion.
 We're
 going
 to
 take
 them


down
 11%
 because
 we
 want
 them
 to
 spend


less
 money
 but
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 take


Nvidia
 up
 because
 they're
 spending
 the


money.
 It
 makes
 it
 should
 be
 conducive


and
 and
 and
 uh
 symbiotic
 with
 each
 other


because
 one
 is
 feeding
 the
 other's


revenues,
 the
 other
 one
 is
 feeding
 the


others
 future
 revenues
 in
 terms
 of
 AI


ROI.


But
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 street
 doesn't


want
 to
 see
 Meta
 spend
 this
 much
 for


whatever
 reason.
 And
 maybe
 it's
 because


they're
 ticked
 off
 about
 Reality
 Labs


and
 the
 metaverse
 and
 the
 glasses
 and


they're
 just
 they
 don't
 think
 there's
 an


efficient
 use
 of
 this
 money
 buying
 GPUs.


Obviously,
 Meta
 doesn't
 have
 a
 cloud,


but
 it
 is
 weird.


the
 way
 they're
 acting
 back
 and
 forth


with
 Meta.


I
 don't
 understand
 what
 you
 find
 weird


in
 the
 story.
 Okay,
 so
 the
 weird
 part
 of


the
 story
 to
 me
 is
 the
 only
 reason


Nvidia
 is
 getting
 the
 multiple
 that
 it's


getting
 up
 to
 5
 trillion,
 is
 because


companies
 like
 Meta,
 which
 there's
 only


a
 handful
 of
 them,
 can
 continue
 to
 keep


fueling
 Nvidia's
 revenues.
 So
 when
 Meta


says
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 spending
 in
 26,


which
 is
 bullish
 Nvidia,
 the
 street's


like,
 "Oh,
 we
 love
 Nvidia,
 but
 we
 hate


Meta,
 but
 the
 only
 reason
 you
 love


Nvidia
 is
 because
 Meta
 is
 going
 to
 keep


spending."
 If
 Meta
 wasn't
 spending,


Nvidia
 wouldn't
 even
 be
 worth
 the


multiple.
 It's
 worth
 that


metaphorically,
 right?
 Because
 Meta
 is
 a


metaphor
 for
 the
 companies
 that
 need
 to


keep
 buying
 GPUs.
 So
 it's
 like
 you
 can't


have
 one
 or
 the
 other.
 Like
 they're
 both


synonymous
 with
 each
 other.
 And
 you
 have


to
 believe
 that
 the
 reason
 Meta
 is


spending
 on
 Nvidia
 is
 because
 they
 will


get
 a
 massive
 ROI
 one
 day
 in
 the
 future.


So
 in
 some
 respect
 you
 would
 think
 the


street
 should
 be
 happy
 that
 there
 it's


not
 like
 Meta
 is
 not
 growing.
 It's
 not


like
 Meta
 is
 not
 profitable.
 It's
 not


like
 outside
 of
 that
 tax
 charge


everything
 they
 needed
 to
 do
 they
 did.


Same
 thing
 with
 Microsoft
 and
 Google.


But
 for
 some
 reason
 the
 street
 wants
 to


punish
 them
 more.
 I
 mean
 look
 at
 what


Microsoft
 said.
 Microsoft
 spent
 35


billion
 in
 capex
 in
 a
 single
 quarter


which
 is
 an
 increase
 of
 over
 10
 billion.


Half
 of
 that
 35
 billion
 in
 the
 last


quarter
 was
 on
 GPUs
 and
 CPUs.


I
 mean,
 the
 street's
 not
 upset
 about


that,
 but
 for
 Meta,
 it's
 like
 a
 totally


different
 angle.
 Oracle
 getting
 hit.


Dude,
 Oracle
 has
 just
 been
 a
 disaster


over
 the
 past
 couple
 month.
 Wow.
 264.


Dude,
 remember
 this
 thing
 went
 from
 232


to
 350.
 There's
 that
 big
 candle
 right


there.
 Two
 or
 sorry,
 223
 to
 $350


or
 345
 to
 be
 exact.
 Down
 to
 264.


That
 is
 a
 bit
 ugly.
 And
 again,
 that's


also
 weird
 to
 me
 why
 Well,
 it's
 also


weird
 why
 it
 jumped
 as
 much.
 It's
 not
 as


weird
 why
 it's
 coming
 back
 down.
 But
 I


think
 the
 debt
 financing
 is
 what
 the


street's
 upset
 about.
 And
 that's
 why


Meta
 is
 a
 little
 again,
 you
 got
 to
 be


just
 watch
 out
 for
 it.
 If
 the
 street


took
 Oracle
 down
 35%
 because
 of
 all
 this


debt
 offering,
 what
 if
 they
 do
 the
 same


to
 Meta?
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would
 be
 35%,


but
 what
 if
 they,
 you
 know,
 continue
 to


punish
 them
 a
 little
 bit
 more?


If
 this
 goes
 down,


is
 anyone
 buying
 the
 Oracle
 dip?
 See,
 I


don't
 I'm
 not
 even
 interested
 in
 the


Oracle
 dip
 because
 they
 just
 said
 all


they
 said
 was
 like
 OpenAI
 is
 going to


pay
 us
 300
 billion.
 And
 from
 the
 get-go,


I
 was
 like,
 that's
 not
 real
 until
 it


becomes
 real.
 And
 unless
 I
 really


believe
 in
 Oracle,
 like
 I
 understand


their
 business
 so
 well,
 which
 I
 don't,
 I


can't
 buy
 it
 based
 off
 a
 RPO
 increase


that
 might
 not
 materialize.


Nonetheless,
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 getting


punished
 aggressively
 and
 you
 might
 have


some
 people
 come
 in
 and
 buy
 that.
 JS,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Admit
 if
 you


compare
 Google
 call
 versus
 meta,
 Google


was
 discussing
 the
 return
 on
 AI.
 Zuck


chocked
 it
 up
 to
 just
 wait
 and
 see


distinct
 difference
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Yeah,


no,
 I
 don't
 disagree
 with
 that
 at
 all.
 I


do
 not
 the
 call
 wasn't
 good.
 The
 call


sucked
 100%.


I
 just
 think
 a
 you
 know
 15%
 haircut
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 justified,
 but
 100%


agree.
 You
 know,
 Sundar
 was
 on
 his
 ZX


didn't
 even
 feel
 like
 he
 wanted
 to
 be


here.
 Someone
 asked
 him
 a
 question
 once


and
 you
 know
 Zucks
 was
 like
 um
 I
 don't


think
 we
 can
 give
 that
 guidance.
 You


know,
 he
 was
 kind
 of
 ask
 he
 was


answering
 the
 question
 in
 a
 way
 that


implied
 that
 the
 person
 asking
 it
 was
 an


idiot.
 And
 it's
 like
 I
 get
 it.
 He


probably
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 stupid


question,
 but
 his
 stock's
 worth
 two


trillion.
 You
 know,
 on
 these
 calls,
 you


kind
 of
 want
 to
 beively
 friendly
 to
 the


people
 that
 are
 going
 to
 upgrade
 or


downgrade
 the
 stock.
 And
 he
 didn't
 have


that.
 He
 didn't
 have
 that
 personality.


It
 was
 kind
 of
 just
 like,
 hey,
 take
 it


or
 leave
 it.
 This
 is
 my
 answer
 and
 it
 is


what
 it
 is.


Sundar
 kind
 of
 leaned
 into
 it.
 As
 that


one's
 moving
 up
 9%.


Uh,
 that
 is
 recovering
 from
 a
 Wow,
 that


fell
 to
 111
 today.
 Oh
 my.
 Fell
 to
 110.


Okay,
 so
 that
 that
 seems
 like
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 a
 recovery
 as
 it
 got
 hit.


Uh,
 Bitcoin
 still
 not
 really
 recovering


fully.
 Again,
 ASSD
 is
 a
 Bitcoin
 treasury


trading
 below
 NAV.


So,
 you
 got
 Bitcoin
 at
 108.
 Bit
 mine's


nav
 now
 is
 still
 1.3.
 Are
 we
 at
 Are
 we


below
 47?


Bit
 mine.
 We
 are
 just
 above
 47.
 4706.


MNAV
 is
 still
 around
 1.2
 to
 1.3.
 The


word
 is
 condescending.
 Yes,
 exactly.


That's
 what
 I
 meant
 to
 say.
 a
 bit
 more


condescending.


Cororeweave
 co-founder
 and
 CEO,
 we


expect
 the
 views
 of
 core
 scientific


shareholders
 and
 look
 forward
 to


continue
 our
 commercial
 partnership.


All right,
 Coreweave
 uh
 not
 going
 to
 be


acquiring
 Core
 Scientific.


Let's
 see
 Roblox.
 We
 got
 the
 Roblox
 CEO


live.
 Let's
 see
 if
 he
 can
 explain
 a


little
 bit
 why
 the
 stock's
 getting
 hit


here.


50
 million
 daily
 active
 users.
 And
 on


the
 way
 we
 run
 the
 the
 business,
 which


is
 cash,
 our
 free
 cash
 flow
 was
 up
 100%


yearonear
 to
 442
 million.
 We
 did
 give
 a


hint
 that
 we've
 cumulatively
 grown
 on


average
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years
 37%.


We
 are
 going
 to
 spend
 and
 invest
 in
 our


infrastructure
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 that


growth,
 but
 overall
 it
 was
 an
 amazing


quarter
 and
 we
 raised
 our
 guidance
 for


Q4.


>> So
 it's
 this
 it's
 the
 spending
 that's


going
 to
 weigh
 down
 margins
 sort
 of


preparing
 for
 the
 future.
 Can
 you
 give


us
 a
 little
 more
 more
 detail
 on
 what


you're
 spending
 on?


>> We
 we
 continue
 to
 be
 optimistic
 about


this
 vision
 of
 having
 10%
 of
 the
 global


gaming
 market
 run
 on
 Roblox.
 We


announced
 during
 this
 quarter
 we
 passed


the
 3%.
 It's
 driven
 by
 amazing
 content


on
 the
 platform
 and
 we
 also
 in
 in
 the


last
 month
 in
 August
 burst
 to
 over
 45


million
 people
 on
 the
 platform
 at
 the


same
 time
 with
 some
 games.
 So
 we
 do
 need


infra
 to
 support
 that.
 Uh
 that
 said
 we


spend
 judiciously
 and
 thoughtfully
 and


we
 we
 invest
 to
 support
 our
 growth.


>> Okay.
 I'll
 try
 to
 go
 deeper
 into
 the


numbers
 and
 see
 why
 the
 stock's
 getting


hit.
 Why
 does
 he
 talk
 like
 he's
 quietly


yelling?


I
 think
 someone
 said
 that
 in
 the
 chat.


Yeah,
 why
 is
 Shen
 Pasa?
 Why
 is
 he


talking
 like
 he's
 quietly
 yelling?


Roblox
 down
 10%.


Oracle's
 about
 to
 own
 Tik
 Tok.
 That's


also
 true.
 They
 will
 have
 access
 to
 Tik


Tok.
 Wow.
 Oracle
 263.


S&P
 still
 holding
 680.


S&P
 not
 giving
 that
 up
 yet.
 Remember,
 we


were,
 guys,
 we
 were
 at
 647
 on
 the
 S&P


two
 weeks
 ago,
 two
 and
 a
 half
 weeks
 ago.


So,
 as
 annoying
 as
 some
 of
 the
 red
 may


be,
 it's
 in
 context,


you
 know,
 it's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 what
 it
 was


a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 And
 Google
 basically


still
 holding
 290


as
 well.
 Amazon
 implied
 move
 is
 6.6.


Okay,
 so
 we're
 at
 what
 225
 on
 Amazon.


Are
 we
 below
 225?
 We
 are
 at
 226.


Let's
 just
 call
 it
 227.


So
 that
 means
 we
 are
 looking
 at


a
 $12
 move
 up
 or
 down.
 So
 we're
 looking


at
 either
 214


or
 241.


Oh,
 let's
 Well,
 let's
 do
 the
 Amazon
 pump


or
 dump
 poll.


See
 what
 people
 think.


By
 the
 way,
 64%
 of
 you
 said
 Meta
 is
 a


buy
 at
 660.


Meta
 is
 a
 buy
 at
 660.


Meta's
 implied
 move
 was
 $100.
 Yeah,
 I


guess
 so.


I
 guess
 the
 implied
 move,
 dude.
 Like,
 as


soon
 as
 I
 saw
 the
 numbers,
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 this
 is
 like
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the


wrong
 source."
 And
 then
 it
 was


confirmed.
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 they


actually
 missed
 EPS
 by
 85%."
 And
 I
 knew


in
 my
 head
 immediately
 it
 had
 to
 be
 the


tax
 thing
 or
 a
 charge
 off
 or
 an


accounting
 thing.
 But
 still,


you
 just
 can't
 see
 those
 types
 of


numbers
 when
 the
 stock
 is
 outperforming


as
 well
 as
 it
 is.


Meta
 657.


No,
 Meta
 is
 not
 an
 intraday
 low
 yet.
 65


650
 is
 the
 intraday
 low.
 Look,
 I
 don't


have
 a
 big
 Meta
 position.
 I
 have
 always


talked
 about
 for
 the
 past
 like
 two


years.
 I
 had
 Meta
 at
 200.
 Um,
 I
 bought


at
 240,
 then
 I
 bought
 at
 320


in
 22,
 then
 it
 fell
 back
 to
 like
 210,
 I


sold
 it,
 I
 bought
 pounder
 at
 12,
 and


then
 I
 never
 got
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 back


in.
 And
 then
 I've
 traded
 it
 back
 and


forth
 here
 and
 there,
 but
 I've
 never


really
 established
 a
 meaningful
 position


in
 MetaT.


And
 I've
 always
 wanted
 to.
 The
 question


is,
 is
 this
 the
 opportunity?


I
 don't
 fully
 know,
 dude.
 There's
 a
 I
 I


I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 super
 greedy
 as
 we're


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 also
 don't


want
 to
 be
 super
 scared.
 So
 I
 I
 want
 to


think
 about
 this
 one
 for
 a
 minute
 for
 a


minute
 and
 say
 like
 hey
 is
 this
 worth


like
 like
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 going
 to


decide
 to
 DCA
 then
 you
 DCA
 like
 like
 I


think
 the
 philosophy
 on
 DCAing
 into
 a


position
 is
 you
 have
 so
 much
 conviction


that
 you
 are
 right
 about
 the
 narrative


or
 the
 stock
 trajectory
 whatever
 that


you
 will
 take
 the
 [ __ ]
 from
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 and
 from
 your
 own
 internal


mindset
 that's
 going
 to
 give
 yourself


[ __ ]
 about
 buying
 a
 stock
 that
 keeps


going
 down
 and
 you
 won't
 care.


And
 the
 only
 Mac
 7
 I
 did
 that
 with
 this


year
 is
 Nvidia
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.


And
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 say
 to
 an
 extent


I'm
 starting
 to
 do
 that
 with
 Amazon.


It's
 definitely
 a
 much
 much
 heavier


position
 than
 Meta.
 Average
 is
 219
 on


Amazon.
 So
 I
 feel
 confident
 on
 that.
 But


it's
 nowhere
 near
 the
 size
 of
 the
 Nvidia


position.


And
 the
 question
 then
 becomes
 you
 only


have
 a
 limited
 amount
 of
 capital.
 Do
 you


go
 50/50
 on
 Amazon
 and
 Meta
 or
 do
 you
 go


in
 on
 Amazon
 for
 2026
 and
 leave
 Meta
 in


the
 dust?
 I
 mean
 like
 these
 are
 these


are
 things
 to
 think
 about.


And
 I
 don't
 know,


take
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 due
 diligence
 to


I
 definitely
 want
 to
 see
 Amazon's


earnings
 because
 that
 would
 help
 because


if
 Amazon
 gets
 a
 juicy
 dip,
 you
 know,


maybe
 Amazon
 is
 where
 the
 capital
 should


go
 to
 besides
 Meta.
 That's
 a
 broad
 Okay,


let
 me
 ask
 this
 question.
 What
 do
 you


guys
 think
 for
 2026
 in
 terms
 of
 just


portfolio
 building
 philosophy?
 Would
 you


rather


I
 guess
 the
 question
 sums
 sums
 up
 to


would
 you
 rather
 diversify
 or
 solidify?


But
 specifically
 for
 the
 Mac
 7,
 everyone


wants
 to
 have
 some
 level
 of
 Mac
 7


exposure.
 I
 would
 imagine
 most
 people


want
 to
 be
 exposed
 to,
 you
 know,
 the


NASDAQ
 in
 some
 way
 for
 2026.
 Would
 you


rather
 pick
 two
 or
 three
 and
 put
 all


your
 money
 into
 that
 that
 you
 want
 to


allocate
 for
 the
 max
 7
 or
 would
 you


rather
 pick,
 you
 know,
 five
 or
 seven


and
 do
 it
 that
 way?
 Like
 if
 you
 had
 70


grand,
 would
 you
 put
 10,000
 into
 all
 of


them
 or
 would
 you
 put
 35
 into
 two
 of


them?


I
 feel
 like
 most
 people
 would
 put
 35


into
 two
 of
 them,
 but
 that
 requires


being
 right
 on
 two
 of
 them,
 right?
 Like,


and
 that's
 the
 hard
 part.
 Obviously,


yeah,
 pretty
 much
 everyone's
 saying
 two


or
 three.


Nvidia
 is
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 I
 I
 really


don't
 think
 Amazon's
 going
 anywhere
 for


me.
 So,
 then
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 room
 for


a
 third
 one.
 And
 the
 question
 is,
 is


that
 meta?


Is
 that
 just
 doubling
 down
 more
 on


Amazon?


Should
 it
 just
 be
 Amazon
 and
 video?


Should
 it
 be
 Google?
 Tesla
 is
 just
 tough


with
 the
 earnings.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really
 I


think
 there's
 just
 you're
 going
 to
 need


to
 see
 earnings
 trajectory
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.


You
 know,
 it's
 just
 like
 when
 Meta
 is


trading
 at
 20
 times
 earnings
 and
 Tesla's


trading
 at
 200
 times,
 it
 is
 it
 is
 tough


to
 pick
 Tesla
 over
 Meta
 unless
 you're
 so


convicted
 on
 the
 robo
 taxi
 robotics


thesis,
 which
 look
 because
 I
 have


robotics
 exposure
 in
 other
 private


companies,
 it's
 not
 the
 biggest
 sell


point
 for
 me
 on
 Tesla.


FSD
 is
 a
 more
 compelling
 thesis,
 but


again,
 that's,
 you
 know,
 that's
 got
 to


start
 to
 scale
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.


Solidify
 shares
 so
 that
 I
 can
 do
 cover


calls.
 That's
 another
 good
 point
 as


well.
 I
 mean,
 meta
 premiums
 are
 pretty


juicy
 as
 well.
 It's
 not
 like
 meta


premiums
 aren't
 good
 premiums
 from
 the


market.


Where's
 Microsoft?
 Are
 we
 recovering
 a


little
 bit?
 Microsoft
 still
 down
 529.


I
 also
 have
 my
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Dude,
 I've


thought
 about
 selling
 Rocket
 Lab
 because


I
 mean
 I'm
 up
 like
 150%
 on
 it
 thanks
 to


Matt
 money
 and
 I'm
 like
 dude
 that
 would


it
 would
 be
 nice
 to
 just
 take
 that
 money


and
 put
 it
 into
 one
 of
 the
 big
 tech.
 But


then
 I'm
 like
 Rock
 Lab's
 going
 to
 be


$100
 one
 day.
 I
 have
 this
 stupid
 thing


at
 26
 and
 I'm
 just
 telling
 myself
 just


leave
 it
 and
 don't
 touch
 it
 and
 forget


about
 it.
 You
 know
 what
 you
 know
 one
 of


the
 things
 I'm
 doing
 on
 my
 Robin
 Hood


account
 with
 these
 individual
 accounts
 I


was
 talking
 about
 this
 a
 little
 bit


yesterday.
 I
 am
 making
 separate


individual
 accounts
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 and


I'm
 literally
 calling
 it
 Google


or
 calling
 it
 XYZ
 stock
 and
 I'm
 just


telling
 myself
 whatever
 money
 I
 want
 to


allocate
 every
 month
 goes
 into
 Google


and
 it
 goes
 in
 that
 separate
 Robin


account
 and
 I
 never
 see
 it.
 So,
 I
 never


even
 have
 a
 like
 u
 an
 emotional
 reaction


to
 sell
 it
 in
 my
 main
 account.
 It's


actually
 a
 really
 useful
 feature
 because


you
 kind
 of
 even
 forget
 it's
 there.
 Like


it's
 it's
 at
 the
 top
 of
 your
 screen
 and


it's
 all
 the
 way
 at
 at
 the
 bottom
 if
 you


scroll
 through
 the
 accounts.
 And
 I'm


like
 it's
 almost
 like
 your
 retirement


account.
 It's
 like
 you
 kind
 of
 forget


what's
 what's
 in
 your
 retirement
 account


if
 you're
 not
 actively
 trading
 on
 it.
 I


did
 that
 with
 LG.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 really


think
 it's
 not
 a
 bad
 idea.


like
 if
 you
 want
 to
 own
 a
 stock
 but
 you


don't
 want
 to
 be
 tempted
 to
 deal
 with
 it


and
 if
 if
 you
 know
 the
 stock
 is
 maybe
 a


bit
 speculative
 and
 you
 know
 that
 you


would
 be
 tempted
 if
 it
 goes
 down
 to
 sell


or
 something
 make
 a
 separate
 Robin


account
 say
 look
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 touch


this
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 in
 whatever
 amount


of
 money
 I
 want
 to
 put
 in
 and
 then
 I


just
 leave
 it
 there
 I
 don't
 even
 have
 to


look
 at
 it


what
 I
 what
 I
 wish
 Robin
 would
 let
 us
 do


is
 transfer
 shares
 from
 your
 main


account
 into
 one
 of the
 separate


accounts
 they
 need
 to
 allow
 us
 to
 do


that
 because
 I
 would
 transfer
 Rocket
 Lab


immediately
 and
 just
 not
 look
 at
 that


[ __ ]


be
 like
 that's
 over
 there


and
 just
 hope
 they
 become
 a
 mini
 SpaceX


one
 day.


I've
 done
 that
 for
 grab
 a
 midset
 and


forget.
 Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


horrible
 idea.
 You
 can
 do
 that.


You
 can
 do
 You
 can
 actually
 transfer


I
 thought
 you
 can
 only
 Oh,
 dude.
 I


haven't
 played
 around
 with
 it
 enough.
 I


thought
 you
 can
 only
 like
 deposit
 money.


You
 can
 legit
 transfer
 shares
 from
 one


account
 to
 another.


transfer
 assets.
 Wow.


Okay.


We're
 gonna
 make
 a
 Rocket
 Lab
 account


then
 and
 just
 keep
 it
 there.
 Dude,
 I


didn't
 know
 that.
 Wow.


Shout
 out
 to
 Vlatty.
 Vlad.


I
 didn't
 know
 that.
 I
 didn't
 know
 you


could
 do
 that.
 I
 thought
 you
 could
 only


put
 in
 money.


Dude,
 I
 think
 Vlad's
 going
 to
 give
 us
 a


good
 quarter.
 I
 think
 Vlad's
 gonna,
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 estimates
 on
 Hood,
 they


raised
 the
 target
 from
 1.1
 billion
 to


1.2.
 2
 for
 the
 earnings.
 I
 think
 Vlad


is
 going
 to
 come
 out
 and
 really
 give
 us


a
 good
 quarter.


Question
 is
 the
 crypto
 volatility
 which


is
 still
 associated
 with
 Hood.
 Can
 the


quarter
 be
 good
 enough
 to
 overlook
 that?


Also,
 the
 stocks
 up
 almost
 3x
 this
 year.


So,
 is
 the
 quarter
 going
 to
 be
 good


enough
 to


to
 deal
 with
 that?


I
 did
 see
 the
 two
 and
 3%
 transfers
 till


November
 19th.
 They're
 doing
 a
 2%


transfer
 as
 well.


Um,


but
 yeah,
 I
 didn't
 know
 they
 would
 allow


you
 to
 transfer
 Tesla
 443.
 Tesla's


getting
 hit.


Tesla's
 getting
 hit.


Dude,
 the
 other
 problem
 is
 if
 I
 freaking


if
 I
 freaking
 sold
 Rocket
 Lab,
 the


amount
 of
 [ __ ]
 I
 would
 get
 from
 you
 guys


every
 day.


The
 amount
 of
 [ __ ]
 I
 would
 get
 from
 You


guys
 are
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 force
 to


hold
 on,
 dude.
 The
 public
 peer
 pressure


The
 amount
 of
 [ __ ]
 I
 would
 get
 from
 the


space
 mob,


the
 amount
 of
 [ __ ]
 I
 would
 get
 from
 Matt


money
 alone
 is
 not
 worth
 it,
 bro.


Because
 as
 soon
 as
 Rocket
 Lab
 makes
 its


gap
 up
 to
 like
 80
 bucks,


I
 would
 let's
 I
 would
 get
 a
 text
 message


from
 him
 every
 day.


That's
 for
 sure.
 Yeah,
 Irwin.
 Oh
 my


goodness.


See,
 I'm
 not
 emotionally
 tied
 to
 Rocket


Lab.
 I
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 Palunteer
 trading


at
 this
 multiple
 and
 not
 not
 even
 for
 a


second,
 not
 even
 for
 a
 millisecond
 think


of
 selling.
 But
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 are


emotionally
 tied
 to
 Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 I
 just


never
 got
 into
 it
 like
 that.


But
 given
 that
 emotional
 attachment,


it's
 hard
 to
 sell.
 Uh
 here
 are
 a
 couple


people
 in
 the
 crypto
 world
 working
 on
 uh


different
 blockchain
 startups
 and
 their


thoughts
 of
 the
 four-year
 cycle.
 curious


what
 people
 have
 to
 say
 on
 if
 we
 think


this
 four-year
 cycle
 is
 going
 to
 end
 in


2026.


>> I
 think
 people
 are
 overindexing
 a
 lot
 on


the
 cycle.


>> When
 I
 think
 back
 to
 2018,
 it
 was
 very


different.
 Obviously,
 the
 the


composition
 of
 market
 participants
 were


very
 different.
 99%
 of
 people
 in
 2018


when
 the
 market
 cycle
 ended
 knew
 what
 a


four-year
 cycle
 was,
 right?
 It
 was


technically
 only
 the
 the
 second
 coming,


but
 people
 were
 talking
 about
 the
 having


cycle
 that
 that
 it
 was
 very
 cemented
 in


people's
 minds.
 And
 then
 2021
 comes


around
 and
 everyone's
 like, "Okay,
 it's


happened
 twice.
 It's
 definitely
 going
 to


happen
 a
 third
 time."
 And
 in
 20
 and
 in


2021,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 still


probably
 80%
 maybe
 85%
 of
 people
 that


owned
 crypto
 knew
 and
 subscribed
 to
 the


four-year
 cycle
 theory.
 They
 knew
 about


the
 having
 argument.
 They
 knew
 about
 all


this
 and
 so
 it
 became
 a
 self-fulfilling


prophecy.
 Now,
 four
 years
 later,
 it's


happened
 three
 times
 in
 a
 row,
 which


obviously
 is
 a
 data
 point
 that
 we
 need


to
 look
 at.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 the


average
 holder
 of
 Bitcoin
 or
 crypto,


maybe
 of
 Bitcoin,
 people
 that
 own
 crypto


probably
 do,
 but
 Bitcoin
 specifically,


they
 don't
 know
 about
 the
 four.
 They


don't
 care
 about
 the
 four
 cycle.


>> They
 didn't
 invest
 because
 of
 the


having.


>> My
 uncle
 who
 bought
 the
 Black
 Rockck
 ETF


is
 not
 doesn't
 know
 about
 a
 four-year


cycle.
 He
 doesn't
 even
 know
 what
 the


having
 is.


>> Yeah.


>> He
 doesn't
 even
 know
 that
 there's
 21


million
 coins.
 He


>> he
 he
 bought
 Bitcoin
 because
 people
 are


like,
 "Oh,
 Bitcoin
 is
 a
 great
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 comp
 to
 gold
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 go


up."
 And
 it's


>> What
 do
 you
 guys
 think
 of
 that?
 Because


I
 do
 think
 that
 argument
 makes
 sense.


We've
 been
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 internal


debate
 on,
 hey,
 is
 there
 a
 cycle
 and


will
 that
 cycle
 result
 in
 a
 cataclysmic


decline
 on
 Bitcoin,
 which
 obviously


Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 get
 hit
 pretty
 bad


if
 that
 happens.
 2026
 is
 the
 year
 in


that
 four-year
 trajectory
 where
 you


should
 see
 a
 collapse
 theoretically.
 But


I
 think
 his
 point
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


It's
 like,
 look,
 your
 uncle
 buying
 the


IBIT
 ETF,
 he's
 buying
 Bitcoin
 for


whatever
 reason
 his
 financial
 manager


told
 him
 about
 Bitcoin
 or
 because
 he
 got


interested
 in
 it,
 not
 because
 he's


preempting
 some
 cyclical
 decline.
 He


probably
 doesn't
 even
 know
 there's
 a


having
 cycle
 or
 anything
 like
 that.


And
 I
 wonder
 how
 many
 of
 the
 normies


like
 myself
 that
 got
 into
 crypto
 are
 so


obsessed
 with
 a
 cycle
 and
 know
 that
 it's


cyclical,
 therefore
 they
 need
 to
 sell
 or


are
 they
 just
 going
 to
 hold
 it
 because


it's
 like,
 okay,
 I
 have
 Bitcoin,
 it's
 my


exposure
 to
 digital
 gold
 hedge,
 and


therefore
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 it.


And
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 in
 Robin
 Hood,


Coinbase,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 BMR,
 you
 kind


of
 need
 that
 cycle
 to
 not
 be
 as


aggressive
 as
 what
 people
 expect.
 Metate


there
 657
 still
 getting
 hit.


Um


or
 else,
 you
 know,
 those
 stocks
 can
 take


a
 beating.


21
 million
 coins,
 no
 more,
 some
 loss,


some
 stolen.
 It's
 going
 up
 based
 on


basic
 principles.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


Sailor
 was
 on
 yesterday
 as
 well,
 and
 he


said,
 uh,
 basically
 when
 he
 dies,
 he's


going
 to
 leave
 all
 of
 his
 Bitcoin,


and
 that's
 the
 best
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 as


a
 proraic
 contribution
 to
 everyone
 in


the
 world
 who
 owns
 Bitcoin.
 What
 I
 would


say
 about
 Bitcoin,
 which
 is
 just


wonderful,
 is
 if
 you
 accumulate
 a
 lot
 of


wealth
 in
 Bitcoin
 and
 you
 just
 burn
 the


keys
 when
 you
 leave,
 you're
 making
 a
 pro


rata
 contribution
 to
 everybody
 that
 owns


Bitcoin
 in
 the
 world
 based
 upon
 their


contribution
 and
 their
 knowledge
 of


Bitcoin.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 that
 supporting


Bitcoin
 as
 a
 protocol
 for
 prosperity
 is


just
 a
 great
 thing
 to
 do.
 And
 otherwise,


I
 think,
 you
 know,
 take
 the
 Bitcoin
 with


you.
 Yeah.
 Well,


>> take
 the
 Bitcoin
 with
 you.
 You
 can
 tell


the
 guy
 philosophically
 really
 believes


in
 uh
 in
 Bitcoin
 if
 he
 were
 to
 not
 sell


it
 or
 not
 let
 anyone
 sell
 it
 when
 he


dies.


Tess
 says,
 "I
 made
 a
 contribution
 to
 the


world
 and
 burned
 enough
 keys."


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 wonder
 if
 this


cyclical
 thesis
 actually
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 I'm
 taking
 my
 paler
 with
 me.


Oh
 my
 gosh.


I
 really
 do
 want
 to
 give
 my
 kids
 some
 of


these
 stocks,
 you
 know?
 Like,
 how
 cool


would
 it
 be
 if
 I
 bought
 a
 stock
 when
 I


was
 22
 and
 I
 and
 I
 give
 it
 to
 my
 kids


when
 I'm
 like
 52.


Now,
 granted,
 given
 how
 expensive
 kids


are
 getting,
 I
 might
 have
 to
 sell
 that


damn
 thing
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 kids,
 but


it
 would
 be
 pretty
 cool.


Um,


you
 need
 to
 find
 a
 wife
 first.
 You
 can't


have
 kids
 with
 another
 man.
 Thank
 you.
 I


didn't
 know
 that.
 I
 was
 not
 aware
 of


that.
 IBM
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 move


right
 here
 at
 1.2.
 Grab
 kind
 of
 holding


on
 today
 at
 603.
 I
 think
 investors
 are


giving
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 juice
 before


earnings.
 It's
 not
 really
 tanking
 back


to
 the
 580s,
 590s.


And
 then
 Monday,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


they
 got.
 Tesla
 still
 is
 down.
 Pounder


did
 not
 get
 to
 200
 today.
 Did
 get
 close


at
 19967.


And
 then
 Nvidia
 down
 about
 2%.


Down
 about
 2%.
 How
 much
 are
 you
 down
 in


the
 day?
 We're
 down
 29K.


We
 were
 down
 seven
 when
 we
 bounced
 at


around
 1020.


Now
 we're
 back
 down.
 Not
 at
 the
 lows
 of


the
 day,
 but
 still
 down.


And
 they
 why
 do
 they
 play
 with
 you
 like


that?
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 They
 just
 like


they
 love


they
 love
 teasing
 me
 about
 this.
 I


showed
 them
 some
 pictures
 the
 other
 day


on
 my
 birthday.
 I
 thought
 that
 would


change
 the
 narrative,
 but
 it
 only
 made


the
 narrative
 worse.
 It's
 like,
 you


can't
 do
 anything,
 dude.
 Once
 people


have
 an
 opinion,


they
 have
 their
 opin.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 I


dude
 I
 will
 have
 a
 kid
 one
 day,
 right?


And
 I'll
 tell
 the
 stream,
 "Hey
 guys,
 big


announcement
 of
 life.
 I
 have
 a
 kid."


First
 comment
 in
 the
 chat.
 So,
 what
 what


uh
 what
 firm
 did
 you
 adopt
 it
 from?
 You


know,
 because
 obviously
 no
 one's
 going


to
 believe
 that
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,


natural
 inception
 to
 have
 a
 kid.
 There's


no
 way
 that's
 possible
 to
 believe.


That's
 obviously


that's
 obviously
 that's
 how
 it's
 going


to
 play
 out.


See,
 look
 at
 this.
 Look
 at
 this.
 Before


I
 even
 said
 it,
 we
 had
 the
 adoption


comments
 before
 I
 even
 said
 it.
 Bro,
 I


know
 you
 guys.
 So,
 there's
 there's
 a


stream
 there's
 a
 delay
 between


Streamyard.
 So,
 you
 guys
 said
 this
 15


seconds
 before
 I
 even
 said
 the
 word


adopted.
 It's
 ridiculous,
 bro.


It's
 absolutely
 ridiculous.


All right,
 folks.
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for


today.
 I
 think
 we're
 pretty
 much
 done.


Uh
 again,
 markets
 red,
 not
 as
 red
 as


they
 were
 in
 the
 morning.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 how
 this
 plays
 out.
 Today
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 big
 day
 on
 the
 close.
 Again,
 to


let
 everyone
 know,
 we
 have
 Apple,


Amazon,
 Coinbase,
 Cloudflare,
 Reddit,


Micro
 Strategy,
 Roku,
 First
 Solar,


Twilio,
 Atlassen,


Lumen,
 Rockin
 Mortgage,
 GoDaddy,
 and


Zillow
 Group.
 So,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 reporting
 today.
 Obviously,


Amazon
 and
 Apple.
 That
 is
 the
 those
 are


the
 two
 biggest
 ones
 for
 us
 to
 look
 at.


65%
 of
 you
 say
 pump
 on
 Amazon.
 35%
 say


dump.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 buying
 any
 Amazon


before
 because


uh
 I'm
 in
 it
 already.
 I'm
 definitely
 not


trading
 Apple.
 Although,
 I
 do
 think


Apple's
 going
 to
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


iPhone
 17
 stuff
 is
 good.
 So,
 I
 do
 think


Apple
 can
 make
 a
 big
 move.
 But,
 I've
 got


skin
 in
 the
 game
 for
 Amazon
 and
 we're


going
 to
 see


what
 we
 got.


Yes.
 Yes,
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 today.
 Micro


Strategy
 is
 today
 as
 well.


There'll
 be
 a
 bunch
 of
 companies.
 Steve


actually
 took
 off
 from
 work
 today,
 so
 he


might
 go
 live
 before
 the
 market
 close.


He
 said
 he
 was
 taking
 off
 today,
 so
 he


might
 actually
 be
 live
 at
 like
 2
 p.m.
 or


something.


But


it'll
 be
 a
 very,
 very
 big
 day
 on
 the


close
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 we


got.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Fiserve?
 I


don't
 know
 enough
 about
 their
 business.


I
 do
 think
 50%
 is
 a
 bit
 aggressive,
 but


there's
 obviously
 something
 the
 street


is
 not
 happy
 about
 for
 them
 to
 to
 get


that
 50%
 hit.


Okay,
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.


We
 have
 it.
 It
 is
 liinal.
 Relating
 to
 a


threshold
 or
 transition.
 The
 space


between
 one
 state
 and
 another.
 Something


in
 between.
 Neither
 here
 nor
 there.


There's
 a
 strange
 calm
 in
 that
 liinal


hour
 between
 midnight
 and
 dawn.


Okay.
 Relating
 to
 a
 threshold
 or


transition.
 I
 think
 the
 actual
 word
 of


the
 day
 is
 capex
 if
 that
 is
 a
 full
 word


because
 that
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 meta


still
 getting
 hit
 12%.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


some
 more
 research
 on
 meta
 today
 try
 to


figure
 out
 what
 exactly
 is
 going
 on.
 I


want
 to
 look
 at the
 updated
 multiples


which
 I
 think
 are
 close
 to
 20
 or
 below


20
 for
 2027
 and
 ask
 myself
 how
 much
 of


that
 multiple
 contraction
 is
 enough
 to


get
 excited
 at
 these
 levels.


But
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 S&P
 500
 right


here,
 685
 down
 about.31%
 on
 the
 day.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 be
 back


on
 the
 market
 close.
 Big
 big
 day
 for


earnings
 again.
 Thank
 you
 for
 everyone


who
 stayed
 yesterday
 for
 the
 full
 nine


hours.
 Was
 super
 fun.
 I'm
 sure
 we'll
 do


that
 again
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 uh
 we
 will


keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Apple
 and
 Amazon


after
 the
 bell.
 It
 will
 be
 an
 important


one.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.


I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 close.
 Bye


everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
