the
 human
 voice.
 It's
 the
 instrument
 we


all
 play.
 It's
 the
 most
 powerful
 sound


in
 the
 world
 probably.
 It's
 the
 only
 one


that
 can
 start
 a
 war
 or
 say
 I
 love
 you.


And
 yet
 many
 people
 have
 the
 experience


that
 when
 they
 speak,
 people
 don't


listen
 to
 them.
 Why
 is
 that?
 How
 can
 we


speak
 powerfully
 to
 make
 change
 in
 the


world?


Since
 you've
 become
 known
 as
 an
 expert


on
 speaking
 and
 sound
 and
 the
 actual


sound
 of
 your
 voice,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


pressure
 on
 the
 sound
 of
 your
 voice.


>> And
 of
 course,
 today
 you're
 interviewing


me
 on
 a
 day
 when
 I've
 got
 a
 croaky


voice,
 which
 happens
 to
 the
 best
 of
 us.


So,
 I
 apologize
 for
 that.
 I'm
 taking


menalyptus
 things.
 I've
 got
 lots
 of


medications
 which
 will
 help
 with
 the


condition,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 go
 with
 what


you've
 got
 on
 the
 day.
 But
 there
 are


exercises
 you
 can
 do
 to
 improve
 the


voice
 and
 to,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 going


to
 a
 gym
 and
 working
 on
 your
 muscles
 and


then
 you've
 got
 more
 strength
 when


you're
 out
 doing
 anything.
 It's
 the
 same


with
 the
 voice.


>> It's
 also
 interesting
 to
 me
 because
 I


think
 that
 often
 when
 people
 think
 about


how
 to
 talk
 so
 people
 will
 listen,


>> they
 focus
 kind
 of
 exclusively
 on
 the


content


>> but
 not
 on
 how
 the
 words
 are
 delivered.


It's
 really
 interesting
 that
 you
 reframe


it
 so
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 what
 you're


saying,
 it's
 also
 how
 you
 say
 it.
 Both


are
 really
 important.
 I
 asked
 that


question
 to
 Chris
 Anderson
 actually
 um


for
 my
 book,
 How
 to
 Be
 Heard.
 I


interviewed
 him
 and
 I
 said
 exactly
 that.


Which
 is
 more
 important,
 Chris?
 And
 he


said,
 "If
 I
 had
 to
 choose,"
 they're
 both


important.
 If
 I
 had
 to
 choose,
 it's


actually
 content
 because
 I
 will
 listen


to
 somebody
 delivering
 really
 important


or
 weighty
 information
 in
 a
 boring
 way,


I'll
 I'll
 stay
 with
 them.
 But
 if


somebody
 is
 speaking
 nonsense


brilliantly,
 it's
 just
 irritating.


>> So
 that's
 true.
 Nevertheless,
 it
 is
 very


frustrating
 if
 somebody's
 giving
 you
 a


really
 big
 gift
 and
 doing
 it
 badly,
 you


know.
 And
 I
 always
 say
 one
 of
 the


greatest
 visualizations
 when
 you
 go
 on


stage
 to
 give
 a
 talk
 is
 that
 you're


giving
 a
 gift.


>> You
 know,
 imagine
 that
 you're
 giving
 a
 a


six-year-old
 a
 wonderful
 present
 and
 how


you
 feel
 at
 that
 moment.
 You
 have
 a
 big


smile
 on
 your
 face.
 You're
 happy.
 You're


excited.
 That's
 how
 you
 feel
 when
 you're


going
 on
 stage
 to
 give
 the
 gift
 of


whatever
 it
 is
 you're
 going
 to
 say
 to


people.
 That's
 a
 wonderful
 way
 to
 be.


And
 it
 helps
 enormously
 to
 to
 have
 that


visualization.


And
 it
 moves
 you
 away
 from
 being


concerned
 about
 yourself


>> and
 much
 more
 into
 a
 relationship
 with


the
 audience
 which
 is
 generous
 and
 happy


and
 based
 in
 love.


>> It
 also
 focuses
 you
 on
 what's
 really


important,
 right?
 Which
 is
 people
 don't


really
 care
 if
 you
 look
 perfect
 or
 if


you
 are
 stumbling
 a
 little
 bit
 over
 your


words.
 They
 care
 about
 what
 you're


giving
 them
 and
 what
 you're
 offering


them.
 If
 you
 give
 someone
 a
 huge
 gift,


that's
 a
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 positive


moment
 for
 them.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 but
 you
 want
 to
 give
 the
 gift


beautifully
 as
 well.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 you
 drop
 it
 on
 the
 floor


and
 it's
 something's
 lost.


>> So,
 it's
 just
 the
 same
 with
 the


delivery.
 Yes.
 You've
 got
 a
 wonderful


thing
 to
 give
 them,
 but
 you
 want
 to
 give


it
 in
 an
 elegant
 and
 beautiful
 way,
 the


way
 that's
 going
 to
 get
 it
 received
 in


the
 best
 possible
 way.
 So,
 delivery
 is


very
 important
 as
 well
 as
 content.
 You


can't
 just
 have
 one
 of
 them.
 You
 need
 to


have
 both.
 you
 go
 travel
 all
 over
 the


world
 giving
 talks
 in
 front
 of
 hundreds


and
 thousands
 of
 people.
 So
 you're
 very


unusual
 in
 that
 you
 you
 talk
 in
 this


professional
 way,
 but
 for
 a
 regular


person,
 I
 think
 probably
 the
 most
 common


times
 when
 they'll
 have
 to
 give
 some


sort
 of
 public
 talk
 or
 a
 presentation
 at


work
 or
 maybe
 they
 give
 a
 speech
 at
 like


a
 wedding
 or
 a
 party.
 Yeah.
 Um
 are
 there


other
 moments
 that
 people
 ask
 you
 about


a
 lot?
 actually
 oneto
 ones
 uh
 you
 know


when
 it's
 somebody
 that
 they
 find
 a
 bit


intimidating
 for
 example
 or
 they
 don't


feel
 heard
 uh
 they
 don't
 feel
 that


somebody's
 listening
 to
 them
 and
 that's


that's
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 questions
 I


get
 is
 how
 do
 I
 get
 somebody
 to
 listen


to
 me
 yeah
 so
 all
 of
 these
 situations


where
 you
 feel
 less
 than


>> you
 don't
 feel
 big
 enough
 you
 don't
 feel


good
 enough
 that's
 a
 situation
 where


it's
 tough
 and
 where
 you
 have
 to
 work


through
 it


>> well
 let
 me
 turn
 that
 question
 back


around
 and
 ask
 you
 the
 question
 that


everyone
 asked
 then
 how
 do
 you
 make


people
 listen
 when
 you
 don't
 feel
 like


you're
 being
 listened
 to.


>> Well,
 the
 way
 to
 not
 to
 do
 that
 is
 to


say
 to
 people,
 you're
 not
 listening
 very


well.
 That
 doesn't
 go
 down
 extremely


well
 with
 people.
 They
 get
 upset.
 And


I'm
 a
 great
 fan
 of
 what
 I
 call
 contracts


or
 agreements
 with
 people.
 So,
 for


example,
 Chris,
 I've
 got
 something


really
 important
 to
 say
 to
 you.
 Have
 you


got
 five
 minutes
 to
 give
 me
 your


undivided
 attention?


>> Absolutely.
 I
 know
 you
 were
 just
 role


playing
 and
 100%
 I'm
 already
 in,
 though.


Yes,
 you
 have
 five
 minutes.
 And
 if
 you


say
 no,
 I
 say
 okay,
 if
 now
 is
 not
 good,


when
 would
 be
 good,


>> we
 make
 an
 appointment.
 And
 then
 if
 I


start
 talking
 and
 you
 start
 doing
 your


email
 or
 sending
 a
 text,
 I
 think
 I
 have


a
 right
 to
 say,
 Chris,
 you
 did
 say
 you


give
 me
 your
 undivided
 attention
 for


this.
 So
 even
 somebody
 who
 habitually


isn't
 very
 good
 at
 listening
 or
 is
 very


distracted
 or
 always
 has
 something
 in


their
 hand,
 those
 people
 can
 still
 be


made
 appointments
 with
 and
 it's
 a
 very


powerful
 way
 to
 get
 yourself
 heard
 and


even
 to
 teach
 them
 the
 power
 of


effective
 listening
 which
 does
 require


total
 focus.


One
 thing
 that
 I
 wonder
 about
 with


people
 like
 that
 is
 sometimes
 you
 have


this
 kind
 of
 very
 brief
 window
 at
 the


when
 you
 start
 talking
 to
 someone
 where


they're
 judging
 is
 this
 worth
 my
 time?


Is
 this
 worth
 my
 attention?
 And
 I
 feel


like
 there's
 the
 the
 positive
 and
 the


negative
 side
 which
 is
 if
 you
 can


communicate
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 makes
 it


worth
 their
 attention,
 they'll
 continue


giving
 it
 to
 you.
 But
 the
 other
 side
 is


even
 for
 me,
 someone
 who
 I
 speak


professionally,
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 that's


a
 big
 insecurity
 for
 me.
 Um,
 if
 I
 know


that
 I've
 lost
 someone's,
 if
 I've
 I
 can


see
 them
 say,
 "What
 he's
 saying
 isn't


important.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 pay


attention."
 It
 really
 gets
 me
 in
 my
 own


head
 and
 then
 I
 start
 feeling
 insecure


and
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 even
 think
 I


should
 win
 them
 back
 after
 that.
 There's


a
 great
 system
 you
 can
 use
 to
 try
 and


avoid
 that
 because
 the
 the
 mistake
 many


people
 make
 is
 they
 work
 with
 uh
 what's


called
 an
 inverted
 Mento
 pyramid,
 which


is
 to
 say
 the
 preamble.
 So,
 thanks
 for


listening
 to
 me,
 Chris.
 and
 uh
 you
 know


this
 happened,
 this
 happened,
 this


happened
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 really
 the


reason
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 is
 this
 and


and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 So,


what
 I'd
 like
 to
 ask
 you
 is
 this.


>> Right
 at
 the
 bottom,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like


those
 emails
 you
 get
 where
 you
 read


seven
 paragraphs
 before
 you
 get
 to
 the


bit
 which
 is
 actually
 asking
 you
 what


they
 want.
 Turn
 it
 round.
 Start
 with


Chris,
 I'm
 talking
 to
 you
 now
 because
 I


need
 you
 to
 do
 this
 for
 me.


>> The
 reason
 is
 this.
 And
 if
 you're


interested,
 here's
 the
 background
 for


what
 happened.
 So,
 the
 pyramid
 is
 that


way.
 You
 start
 with
 the
 point.
 M


>> if
 you
 always
 start
 with
 the
 point
 it's


like
 I
 I
 would
 say
 to
 people
 if
 they're


devising
 content
 for
 a
 for
 a
 talk


there's
 an
 old
 system
 that
 they
 used
 to


have
 the
 essaists
 used
 to
 do
 this
 which


is
 say
 say
 say say say say say say say




say say say say say say say say say say
say say say
 say say say say say say say




say say say say say say say say say say
say say say
 what
 you're
 going
 to
 say
 say


it
 then
 say
 what
 you
 said


>> so
 you
 summarize
 at
 the
 beginning
 and


the
 end
 you
 give
 people
 the
 reason
 it's


like
 um
 if
 you
 give
 people
 the
 why
 first


then
 you
 have
 them
 with
 you
 they


understand
 why
 it
 is
 they
 should
 then


give
 you
 their
 attention
 for
 the
 rest
 of


whatever
 it
 is
 you're
 going
 to
 I've


heard
 um
 doctors
 sometimes
 refer
 to
 this


as
 like
 the
 doors
 stop
 moment
 where
 they


have
 the
 whole
 checkup
 and
 then
 right
 at


the
 end
 as
 the
 person's
 leaving
 the
 room


they
 go,
 "Oh,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 it
 a


problem
 that
 I
 have
 a
 boil
 on
 my
 foot?"


That's
 you
 know,
 that's
 a
 very
 graphic


example,
 but
 but
 they
 they
 say
 the
 thing


that
 was
 the
 real
 reason
 they
 made
 the


appointment
 at
 the
 very
 end
 after


everything
 else.


>> Yes.
 Which
 is
 unfortunate.
 If
 you


imagine
 the
 the
 thing
 as
 a
 pyramid
 and


you
 do
 the
 why
 at
 the
 beginning,
 then


you
 captivate
 people
 immediately.
 as


long
 as
 there's
 a
 reason
 for
 them
 to


listen
 to
 it.
 And
 presumably
 you've


thought
 about
 that.
 There's
 a
 concept
 I


teach
 a
 lot
 in
 in
 my
 work
 which
 is
 the


relationship
 between
 speaking
 and


listening
 is
 circular.


>> It's
 not
 linear.
 It's
 not
 I
 speak
 you


listen.
 There
 is
 this
 circle
 going
 on


all
 the
 time
 because
 the
 way
 I
 speak


affects
 the
 way
 you
 listen.


>> And
 the
 way
 you
 listen
 affects
 the
 way
 I


speak.
 As
 you
 just
 said,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 feel
 somebody's
 attention
 wondering,


you
 start
 getting
 nervous
 and
 having
 to


work
 harder
 and
 pressure
 mounts.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 circle
 that's
 going
 on
 all
 the


time
 in
 a
 context.
 Now,
 here
 we
 have
 a


lovely
 context
 of
 a
 completely
 quiet


room,
 microphones,
 everybody
 can
 hear


everything
 that
 we're
 saying.
 That's
 not


always
 the
 case,
 is
 it?


>> You
 know,
 you
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 propose


marriage
 to
 somebody
 in
 a
 noisy


Starbucks


>> shouting
 at
 the
 top
 of
 your
 Well,
 you


might,
 but
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 think


about
 might
 get
 a
 different
 answer.


>> You
 might.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 be
 conscious


also
 of
 the
 context
 around
 us
 and
 try


and
 optimize
 that.
 So
 that's
 about


listening
 to
 the
 sound
 around
 us.
 Is


this
 the
 best
 sound
 it
 could
 be?
 And


then
 being
 conscious
 of
 the
 fact
 that


everybody
 listens
 in
 a
 different
 way.


And
 it's
 a
 huge
 mistake.
 That's
 very


very
 common.
 People
 assume
 everybody


listens
 like
 I
 do.


>> They
 do
 not.
 And
 once
 you
 get
 that,
 it


changes
 everything
 because
 you
 start


asking
 the
 question,
 what's
 the


listening
 I'm
 speaking
 into?
 So,
 what's


your
 listening
 now?
 Right
 now,
 I
 can


tell
 you're
 listening
 to
 me
 very


attentively.
 You're
 looking
 at
 me.


You're
 giving
 me
 signals
 that
 show
 me


you're
 with
 me
 and
 so
 forth.
 If
 you
 were


loling
 back
 in
 your
 chair,
 staring
 at


the
 ceiling,
 you
 know,
 I'd
 have
 a


different
 feeling.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 what's
 the
 listening
 I'm


speaking
 into
 is
 a
 great
 question
 to
 be


asking
 because
 you
 can
 then
 adapt
 your


delivery
 whether
 it's
 pace,
 tone,


vocabulary,


body
 language,
 content,
 it
 it
 all
 can
 be


changed
 to
 fit
 the
 person
 you're
 talking


to.
 That's
 how
 you
 hit
 the
 bullseye


instead
 of
 missing
 the
 target


altogether.
 It
 also
 is
 really


interesting
 to
 think
 about
 this
 for
 me


because
 I
 think
 there's
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


information
 out
 there
 about
 how
 to
 speak


and
 how
 to
 make
 yourself
 be
 heard


especially
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 you
 know


self-help


um
 optimization
 space.
 There's
 a
 lot


about
 how
 to
 be
 the
 person
 where
 people


listen
 to
 them.
 Um
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


very
 self
 argrandizing.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


ego
 in
 that.
 there's
 much
 less
 in
 how
 to


listen,
 how
 to
 be
 generous,
 how
 to
 give


the
 attention
 to
 someone
 else.
 And
 what


one
 thing
 that's
 really
 resonating
 with


me
 about
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 the
 um


the
 idea
 that
 when
 we
 listen
 really


well,
 it's
 this
 virtuous
 cycle
 where
 the


whole
 conversation,
 we
 get
 to
 speak


better
 because
 we
 are
 listening
 well
 and


the
 whole
 thing
 feeds
 on
 each
 other.


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 number.
 My
 TED
 talk
 on


speaking,
 which
 is
 the
 one
 that's
 gone


completely
 ballistic
 and
 is
 the
 top
 10


of
 all
 time,
 has
 been
 seen
 by
 five
 times


as
 many
 people
 as
 my
 TED
 talk
 on


listening.


>> Now,
 that
 says
 something
 to
 me.
 You


know,
 we're
 in
 a
 world
 where
 we're
 very


keen
 to
 be
 heard
 but
 not
 so
 interested


in
 listening.


>> And
 that
 doesn't
 work
 very
 well
 if
 you


think
 about
 it.
 If
 everybody
 is
 speaking


to
 be
 heard
 and
 nobody's
 listening,


that's
 that's
 a
 fail.
 So
 listening
 to
 me


is
 the
 foundational
 skill
 and
 it's
 the


thing
 that
 is
 I
 think
 in
 danger
 in
 the


world
 today.
 We're
 seeing
 the
 lack
 of


listening
 all
 around
 us
 in
 polarization,


demonization,


trolling,
 you
 know,
 aggression,


rudeness,
 the
 conflation
 of
 opinions


with
 facts,
 which
 I
 talked
 about
 in
 that


TED
 talk
 on
 speaking,
 you
 know,
 as
 as


dogmatism,
 one
 of
 the
 seven
 deadly
 sins


of
 communication.


>> That's
 all
 around
 us
 now.
 And
 it's
 all


founded
 in
 not
 listening
 to
 other


people,
 being
 in
 oneself.
 You
 know,
 I'm


right,
 you're
 wrong.
 That's
 the
 way
 it


works
 at
 the
 moment.
 It's
 so
 wrong.


We're
 not
 in
 a
 zero
 sum
 world.


>> Two
 people
 can
 be
 right
 and
 have


different
 views
 because
 they're
 in
 their


own
 perspective.
 They've
 got
 their
 own


history,
 their
 own
 values,
 attitudes,


beliefs,
 their
 own
 listening
 positions,


their
 own
 everything.
 And
 they
 can
 have


very
 different
 views
 and
 both
 be
 right.


You
 know,
 people
 do
 everything
 and
 say


everything
 for
 a
 reason.
 And
 once
 we


start
 to
 accept
 that
 and
 listen
 to


understand
 other
 people,
 that's
 a


different
 world.
 And
 that's
 the
 world
 I


want
 to
 try
 and
 generate.
 That's
 why
 my


my
 focus,
 my
 whole
 purpose
 in
 the
 world


now
 is
 to
 generate
 listening.


>> Let
 me
 just
 ask
 you
 this,
 which
 is


in
 really
 like
 a
 practical
 way.
 If
 I


want
 to
 make
 my
 voice
 sound
 better,
 I


can
 warm
 it
 up.
 There's
 all
 sorts
 of


vocal
 warm-ups
 that
 you
 can
 find
 that


you
 have
 taught
 people.
 I
 can
 drink
 hot


tea.
 I
 can
 do
 all
 these
 things
 that
 make


my
 voice
 sound
 better.
 What
 are
 the


practical


like
 exercises
 that
 people
 can
 do
 to


listen
 better
 rather
 than
 speak
 better?


Well,
 first
 is
 to
 rediscover
 your


connection
 with
 silence.


You
 know,
 over
 half
 the
 world's


population
 lives
 in
 cities
 now
 and
 very


rarely
 experiences
 silence
 or
 nature


sound,
 which
 is
 another
 topic
 entirely.


So,
 we
 evolved
 over
 maybe
 300,000
 years.


Homo
 sapiens
 has
 been
 here
 and
 3
 million


years
 before
 that
 our
 ancestors
 we


evolved
 in
 pretty
 quiet
 situations
 bird


song
 water
 wind
 and
 so
 forth
 we're
 now


in
 a
 very
 different
 situation
 uh
 and


we're
 dealing
 with
 noise
 all
 around
 us


so
 it's
 very
 difficult
 for
 us
 to
 listen


because
 we
 become
 numb
 and
 silence
 is


the
 baseline
 there
 are
 different


qualities
 of
 silence
 I
 could
 go
 on
 about


silence
 for
 a
 long
 time
 silence
 is


amazing
 it
 is
 a
 sound
 and
 it's
 a
 very


important
 sound.
 Getting
 silence
 into


your
 life
 is
 a
 very
 excellent
 way
 of


resetting
 your
 ears.
 Reacquainting


yourself
 with
 a
 baseline
 from
 which
 you


can
 then
 work
 and
 listen
 aresh.
 It
 is


refreshing.
 Simply
 3
 minutes
 a
 couple
 of


times
 a
 day
 is
 very
 helpful.
 So
 you


might
 have
 to
 go
 and
 lock
 yourself
 in
 a


bathroom
 or
 a
 closet
 or
 something
 in


order
 to
 get
 it
 in
 a
 city
 and
 absolute


silence
 not
 necessarily
 the
 quietest


thing
 you
 can
 get.
 Of
 course,
 if
 you're


lucky
 enough
 to
 live
 near
 nature,
 you


can
 go
 and
 do
 shinyoku,
 forest
 bathing,


get
 out
 into
 nature
 and
 listen
 to


beautiful
 s
 tranquility
 as
 well.
 That's


also
 good
 for
 you.
 So
 doing
 that
 and


getting
 away
 from
 the
 noise,
 that's
 a


very
 very
 good
 thing
 to
 do
 in
 the
 first


place.
 And
 then
 I
 have
 some
 exercises


for
 listening
 skills
 in
 conversation


particularly
 like
 this.
 I
 mean
 you're


doing
 one
 of
 them
 very
 well
 all
 the
 time


now
 which
 is
 rasa
 which
 is
 receive.
 That


is
 to
 say,
 pay
 attention.
 Look
 at
 the


person
 who's
 speaking.
 Appreciate
 the


little
 things
 you're
 doing
 like
 nods


>> and,
 you
 know,
 eyebrow
 blinks,
 raised


eyebrows,
 smiles,
 head
 bobs,
 all
 of


those.
 Exactly.
 All
 of
 those
 kind
 of


things.


>> Uh,
 the
 S
 is
 summarize,
 which
 you've


been
 doing
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 often
 uses
 the


word
 so.
 It's
 a
 very
 important
 little


word
 that
 got
 abused
 for
 years
 when


everybody
 was
 starting
 every
 sentence


with
 the
 word
 so.
 So,
 what
 you've
 what


I've
 understood
 is
 this.
 Or
 so
 what


we're
 saying
 is
 this.
 So
 what
 I
 got
 is


that
 is
 that
 right?
 Checks
 receipt.
 And


then
 the
 A
 is
 ask
 questions.
 Ideally


open-ended
 questions.
 Why,
 what,
 which,


when,
 where,
 who,
 those
 kind
 of


questions
 that
 do
 not
 permit
 the
 answer


yes
 or
 no.
 So
 Russa,
 receive,


appreciate,
 summarize,
 ask.
 That
 oils


conversation
 very
 well.
 And
 actually
 a


man
 told
 me
 after
 I
 taught
 him
 that,
 he


he
 came
 back
 months
 later
 and
 said,
 "You


saved
 my
 marriage
 with
 that
 thing."


>> Wow.
 So
 it's
 very
 very
 effective
 in


conversation.
 So
 there's
 a
 couple
 of


steps
 on
 the
 way
 to
 becoming
 a
 better


listener.
 Silence.
 Rasa.


>> I
 would
 say
 I
 am
 challenged
 the
 most
 by


silence.
 I
 like
 to
 fill
 silence.
 I
 like


to
 have
 jokes
 or
 laughter
 or
 overlapping


conversation
 and
 and
 that's
 something


I've
 really
 had
 to
 learn
 about.
 And
 one


of
 the
 ways
 that
 I
 have
 learned
 about
 it


is
 by
 professionally
 interviewing
 people


because
 something
 that
 I
 think
 is
 kind


of
 journalism
 101,
 interviewing
 101,
 and


yet
 is
 such
 an
 incredibly
 effective


tool,
 I
 am
 always
 shocked
 by
 how
 well
 it


works
 is
 ask
 the
 question
 and
 then
 don't


say
 anything.
 Even
 if
 they
 don't
 answer


right
 away,
 let
 them
 fill
 the
 silence.


It's
 always
 interesting
 if
 you
 just


fight.
 I
 have
 to
 really
 fight
 my
 urge
 to


ask
 you
 a
 question
 and
 then
 clarify.
 If


I
 just
 keep
 it
 quiet,
 it's
 incredible


how
 something
 else
 will
 come
 up
 in


there.
 Another
 thing
 that
 strikes
 me


about
 silence
 is
 in
 your
 book
 sound


effects.
 You
 have
 four
 sections.
 And
 one


of
 the
 sections
 is
 silence
 that
 is
 just


as
 important
 as
 nature
 sounds
 as
 in


these
 other
 big
 types
 of
 noise.
 Um,
 and


yet
 I
 think
 many
 of
 us
 don't
 often
 think


of
 silence
 as
 that
 powerful
 or
 something


that
 we
 need
 to
 listen
 for.


>> It
 is
 so
 powerful.
 You
 know,
 in
 your


job,
 as
 you
 just
 said
 to
 me,
 if
 you
 ask


a
 question,
 shut
 up
 and
 let
 the
 person,


even
 if
 it
 even
 if
 you
 have
 to
 wait.


>> That's
 not
 the
 only
 situation
 in
 which


silence
 is
 very
 effective.
 Salespeople.


>> The
 research
 I've
 just
 seen
 recently


shows
 that
 most
 salespeople
 speak
 60
 65%


of
 a
 of
 a
 call
 and
 listen
 35%.
 It's
 the


wrong
 way
 round.
 In
 fact,
 the
 sweet
 spot


for
 closing
 is
 to
 reverse
 that
 entirely.


listen
 65%
 and
 speak
 35%.
 And
 any
 great


salesperson
 would
 tell
 you
 the
 most


important
 part
 of
 the
 conversation
 is


listening.


>> And
 if
 you're
 closing
 in
 a
 sales


conversation,
 you
 ask
 the
 question
 and


do
 not
 say
 anything
 for
 the
 longest
 time


you
 can.
 It
 can
 get
 very
 uncomfortable.


You
 might
 have
 to
 hold
 your
 leg
 like


this
 and
 just
 sit
 waiting.
 But
 if
 you
 do


that,
 the
 result
 is
 always
 that
 that
 the


person
 will
 come
 back
 with
 some
 sort
 of


question
 that
 you
 can
 answer.
 So
 it's


really
 important
 and
 the
 biggest
 mistake


I
 see
 with
 people
 on
 stage
 is
 gabbling


is
 filling
 every
 moment.


>> That's
 where
 the
 you
 know
 ums
 all
 those


fillers
 come
 from
 is
 the
 uncomfortable


feeling
 when
 there's
 silence.
 So
 you


know
 I
 can
 do
 a
 thing
 on
 stage
 when
 I'm


talking
 I
 can
 just
 stop.


>> That's
 my
 max
 right
 there.
 That's
 that's


where
 I
 got
 uncomfortable.
 So,
 if
 I'm


standing
 there
 and
 I've
 stopped
 and
 I'm


not
 looking
 uncomfortable
 or
 flustered


or
 going
 red
 or,
 you
 know,
 the
 audience


know
 there's
 nothing
 going
 wrong
 and


they're
 they're
 going,
 "Ah,
 it's
 nice.
 A


bit
 of
 peace
 and
 quiet.
 What
 shall
 I


have
 for
 lunch?"
 You
 know,
 and


>> that's
 what
 I'm
 always
 thinking,
 by
 the


way.


>> We
 all
 have
 a
 little
 pause.
 You
 can
 stop


for
 the
 longest
 time.
 Really,
 3
 to
 5


seconds
 is
 nothing.


>> And
 silence
 is
 such
 a
 powerful
 tool.


When
 you
 make
 a
 really
 important
 point,


you
 can
 say
 this
 and
 then
 stop.


and
 let
 it
 settle
 and
 then
 you
 know
 the


thing
 will
 move
 on.
 So
 being
 comfortable


with
 silence
 I
 think
 is
 is
 the


foundation
 of
 all
 powerful
 speaking


really.


>> You
 also
 have
 uh
 an
 an
 acronym
 for
 how


to
 speak
 well.
 That's
 hail.
 Talk
 us


through
 what
 hail
 is.


>> Okay.
 Hail
 which
 means
 to
 greet
 or


acclaim
 enthusiastically
 which
 is
 nice.


Uh
 it
 stands
 for
 honesty
 which
 is
 to
 be


clear
 and
 straight
 not
 use
 jargon
 not


confuse
 people.
 not
 try
 and
 impress


people
 with
 big
 words
 or
 you
 know


complex
 ideas
 always
 what's
 the


listening
 I'm
 speaking
 into
 what
 kind
 of


language
 is
 going
 to
 get
 this
 across
 in


the
 most
 effective
 way
 so
 honesty
 clear


and
 straight
 the
 A
 is
 authenticity
 which


means
 being
 yourself
 now
 I
 love
 Susan


Kane's
 talk
 I
 I
 remember
 I
 met
 Susan


after
 that
 talk
 and
 said
 do
 you
 know


your
 life
 is
 going
 to
 change
 completely


after
 you
 did
 that
 she
 gave
 a
 wonderful


talk
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 valuing


introverts


>> and
 Actually,
 interestingly,
 when
 I'm
 on


the
 speaking
 circuit,
 the
 vast
 majority


of
 the
 professional
 speakers
 that
 I
 meet


are
 introverts,


>> and
 I
 am.


>> We've
 all
 learned
 to
 go
 on
 stage
 and


project
 and
 do
 a
 job
 and
 be
 comfortable


with
 a
 thousand
 people
 looking
 at
 us.


Nevertheless,
 we're
 introverts.
 And


being
 authentic
 to
 yourself,
 I
 don't
 go


on
 stage
 and
 do
 all
 sorts
 of,
 you
 know,


running
 about
 and
 whooping
 and


hollering.
 That's
 not
 me.


>> So,
 I'm
 very
 still
 on
 stage.
 I'm
 quiet


and
 I
 talk
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 genuine
 sincere


way.
 That's
 who
 I
 am.
 Pretending
 to
 be


somebody
 else,
 it
 never
 really
 lands.


Unless
 you're
 an
 actor
 or
 you're
 doing
 a


part,
 in
 which
 case,
 brilliant.
 But
 if


you're
 talking
 as
 yourself,
 be
 yourself.


You
 are
 enough.
 The
 I
 is
 integrity,


which
 means
 being
 your
 word.
 If
 you
 say


it
 and
 then
 you
 don't
 do
 it,
 people


learn
 that
 pretty
 quickly.
 And
 your


words
 just
 evaporate
 like
 puddles
 in
 the


sun.
 They
 go.
 And
 the
 L
 perhaps


surprisingly
 is
 love.
 And
 I
 don't
 mean


romantic
 love.
 I
 mean
 wishing
 people


well.
 As
 you
 walk
 on
 stage,
 you
 know,
 we


talked
 earlier
 about
 the
 idea
 of
 giving


a
 gift.
 You
 know,
 when
 I
 go
 on
 stage
 and


if
 I
 feel
 I've
 got
 a
 gift
 to
 give


people,
 I'm
 happy.
 And
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


have
 a
 little
 acronym
 for
 the
 moment


you're
 on
 the
 spot.
 It's
 another


fourletter
 four
 letter
 fourletter


acronym
 Bess
 which
 is
 as
 you
 walk
 to
 the


spot
 breathe
 in
 because
 your
 voice
 is


just
 breath
 and
 it's
 good
 for
 nerves
 as


well
 to
 do
 that
 expand
 your
 awareness
 to


see
 the
 whole
 room
 if
 you
 can
 take
 your


stance
 and
 there's
 a
 great
 visualization


I
 can
 give
 you
 for
 that
 and
 smile


because
 you're
 happy
 you're
 going
 to


give
 a
 gift
 and
 then
 you
 get
 people


smiling
 back
 and
 you've
 made
 a


relationship
 with
 the
 audience
 which
 is


positive
 and
 The
 smile
 one
 is


interesting
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 that's


one
 that
 I
 remind
 myself
 of
 a
 lot


consciously.
 Someone
 the
 way
 it
 was
 once


told
 to
 me
 is
 if
 you're
 ever
 not
 sure


what
 to
 do
 with
 your
 face,
 try
 smiling.


And
 it
 is
 amazing
 how
 dramatically
 that


changes
 the
 tenor
 of
 an
 interaction
 if
 I


just
 instead
 of
 giving
 them
 this
 dull


kind
 of
 intimidating
 face,
 if
 I
 smile


and
 then
 we
 start
 having
 a
 I
 mean
 you


obviously
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 smiling
 if


they're
 telling
 you
 a
 tragic
 story
 then


it's
 disturbing.
 But
 most
 of
 the
 time
 it


it
 really
 does
 change
 things
 to
 to
 have


that
 kind
 of
 openness
 on
 your
 on
 your


face


>> when
 it's
 intentional.


>> You
 know,
 there
 are
 people
 I've
 met
 who


smile
 almost
 constantly
 because
 they've


learned
 that,
 you
 know,
 they
 don't
 feel


enough
 or
 there's
 something
 they're


trying
 to
 make
 connection
 all
 the
 time


and
 there's
 a
 dis
 discomfort
 about
 it.


So
 they're
 smiling
 all
 the
 time
 that


becomes
 meaningless.
 So,
 one
 of
 the


great
 things
 I
 love
 about
 speaking
 and


particularly
 speaking
 on
 stage
 is
 it's


the
 time
 when
 I'm
 probably
 most


conscious.
 You
 better
 be
 conscious
 if


there's
 a
 thousand
 people
 looking
 at


you.


>> When
 are
 you
 going
 to
 be
 conscious?
 If


not,
 then


>> and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 work
 that
 I


do
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 I
 talk
 about
 both


speaking
 and
 listening
 is
 really
 about


consciousness.
 It's
 about
 becoming
 a


more
 conscious
 human
 being.
 So
 when
 on


stage
 it's
 conscious
 gesticulation,


conscious
 stance,
 conscious
 of
 the


connection
 with
 the
 audience
 and
 the


listening
 I'm
 speaking
 into.
 Conscious


of
 the
 way
 that
 dynamic
 is
 working.
 You


know,
 are
 they
 looking
 tired?
 Is
 it
 just


after
 lunch?
 You
 know,
 I
 often
 get
 that


what's
 called
 the
 graveyard
 slot.
 You


probably
 do
 as
 well.
 Oh,
 he's
 a
 TED


speaker.
 He
 can
 deal
 with
 that.
 We'll


put
 him
 on
 at
 two
 just
 when
 everybody's


tired
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 being
 conscious


of
 the
 whole
 situation
 um
 you
 know
 when


I
 go
 into
 a
 big
 venue
 going
 to
 see
 the


AV
 guys
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 wonderful


crew
 here.
 Hello
 I'm
 Julian.
 How
 are


you?
 You
 know
 making
 connections
 with


people
 because
 all
 of
 it
 matters.
 All
 of


it
 has
 an
 effect.
 So
 I
 love
 that
 whole


process
 of
 switching
 on
 and
 being


conscious
 about
 every
 step.
 the
 tech,


the
 prep,
 the
 rehearsal,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 checks,
 the
 people
 around,
 uh,
 and


then
 the
 walking
 on
 stage
 and
 doing
 your


best
 job
 to
 deliver.
 I
 was
 very
 lucky


with
 that
 last
 TED
 talk.
 I'd
 done
 four


in
 successive
 years
 before
 that.
 So,
 I


had
 practice


>> and
 so
 fortunately,
 I
 was
 able
 to
 do


that
 one
 really
 well,
 which,
 you
 know,


was
 quite
 important
 because
 if
 you're


going
 to
 stand
 on
 the
 TED
 stage
 and


speak
 about
 speaking,


>> that's
 the
 bar
 is
 high.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 that's
 sticking
 your
 head


above
 the
 parapit
 big
 time


>> for
 me
 with
 with
 both
 speaking
 and


listening.
 I
 come
 at
 this
 as
 someone
 who


professionally
 has
 worked
 in
 comedy
 but


also
 I
 used
 to
 teach
 fifth
 grade
 and
 an


elementary
 school
 and
 I'm
 always
 so


struck
 by
 how
 especially
 hail
 all
 of


those
 pieces
 are
 so
 much
 what
 it
 takes


to
 talk
 to
 kids
 and
 kids
 are
 such


perfect
 barometers
 of
 whether
 you
 are


being
 honest,
 authentic,
 whether
 you


have
 integrity
 and
 whether
 you're
 coming


with
 love.


>> Yeah.
 because
 they
 haven't
 learned
 how


not
 to
 do
 that.


>> Yeah.
 And
 they'll
 just
 tell
 you
 like


that's
 not
 true
 or
 you're
 not.
 If
 the


biggest
 thing
 that
 I
 learned
 in
 the


classroom
 was
 it
 is
 so
 you
 have
 such
 a


tendency
 as
 a
 teacher,
 especially
 a
 new


teacher
 to
 say
 in
 our
 classroom,
 we
 do


not
 throw
 paper
 into
 the
 trash.
 We
 get


up
 and
 we
 put
 it
 in.
 And
 kids
 go,
 "Okay,


well,
 if
 that's
 a
 rule,
 there's
 always


at
 least
 one
 kid
 that
 says,
 "Well,
 I'm


going
 to
 test
 if
 that's
 a
 rule."
 And


then
 they
 throw
 the
 paper
 in
 the
 trash


and
 you
 don't
 do
 anything.
 They
 go,


"Okay,
 well
 that's
 not
 a
 rule
 then."


There
 was
 no
 integrity
 behind
 it.


>> And
 adults
 are
 like
 that,
 too.
 They're


just
 a
 little
 sneakier
 about
 it,
 I


think.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's
 so
 true.
 So,
 I
 think


integrity
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 difficult


things
 in
 life
 because
 we
 all
 like
 to


impress
 people
 or
 to
 be
 liked
 and
 we


will
 say
 things
 to
 get
 liked.
 So,
 ego
 is


the
 driving
 force
 behind
 a
 lot
 of


behaviors
 which
 are
 not
 very
 helpful.


You
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 talk
 about


is
 internal
 listening.
 Listening
 inside


to
 the
 voice
 inside
 you.
 And
 lot
 a
 lot


of
 people
 have
 a
 very
 negative
 voice.


There's
 there's
 a
 critic
 in
 there
 going,


"You
 idiot.
 Don't
 get
 on
 that
 dance


floor.
 You'll
 mess
 that
 up.
 Don't
 do


that.
 You
 know,
 all
 that
 kind
 of


negative
 selft
 talk.
 And
 the
 answer
 to


that
 is
 to
 realize
 that
 you're
 not
 that


voice.


If
 you're
 not
 that
 voice,
 who
 are
 you?


You're
 the
 one
 listening
 to
 the
 voice.


>> And
 the
 voice
 may
 be
 a
 part
 of
 you


that's
 been
 damaged
 in
 the
 past.
 It's
 a


fragment
 which
 is
 trying
 to
 stop
 pain


from
 happening
 again.
 But
 if
 you're
 the


one
 listening,
 you're
 the
 the
 king
 or


queen
 on
 the
 throne.
 The
 jester's
 coming


up
 and
 giving
 you
 that.
 You
 can
 tassel


its
 head
 and
 say,
 "Thanks.
 Now
 go
 away.


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it
 anyway.
 So
 that
 kind


of
 awareness
 of
 ego
 I
 think
 is
 really


important
 especially
 where
 it
 comes
 to


integrity
 and
 to
 stopping
 the
 mouth
 from


running
 off
 and
 making
 promises
 that
 we


can't
 writing
 checks
 we
 can't
 cash.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 humor
 and


laughter
 as
 a
 part
 of
 this
 as
 well?
 One


of
 the
 classic
 tips
 that
 people
 say
 is


start
 with
 a
 joke
 or
 you
 know
 and
 I


think
 that
 for
 me
 is
 often
 a
 shorthand


because
 when
 you're
 standing
 in
 front
 of


a
 room
 of
 a
 thousand
 people
 or
 if
 you're


standing
 in
 front
 of
 a
 room
 of
 two


people
 it's
 hard
 it's
 a
 little
 hard
 to


know
 whether
 you're
 connected
 or
 not
 but


if
 they
 laugh
 you
 instantly
 have
 that


well
 we
 must
 be
 connected
 because
 they


are
 there's
 this
 feedback
 immediately.


So
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


>> Well
 it's
 lovely
 to
 do
 if
 that's
 you


authentically.


>> So
 you're
 a
 comedian
 that's
 brilliant.


I'm
 not.
 And
 I
 would
 feel
 uncomfortable


walking
 on
 stage
 with
 a
 prepared
 joke


>> because
 I
 probably
 wouldn't
 deliver
 it


brilliantly.
 And
 there's
 nothing
 worse


than
 a
 joke
 that
 falls
 flat.


>> Yeah.
 Agree.


>> The
 tumble
 weed
 is
 blowing
 down
 the


street.


>> Anyway,
 let's
 move
 on.
 You
 know,
 it's


not
 a
 comfortable
 moment.
 So,
 if
 you


feel
 proficient,
 if
 it's
 really
 what
 you


do,
 if
 you're
 a
 funny
 guy,
 be
 a
 funny


guy.
 If
 you're
 not,
 my
 style
 of
 humor


would
 be
 more
 to
 share
 what's
 going
 on


for
 me
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 ironic
 or
 gently


amusing
 way,
 which
 again
 makes
 that


connection
 with
 the
 audience.
 Um,
 maybe


something's
 happened
 on
 the
 way
 there
 or


whatever
 it
 may
 be.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 do
 that


at
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 talk
 because
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 the
 talk,
 I
 want
 them


to
 get
 the
 why.


>> So,
 I
 don't
 do
 small
 talk.
 Yeah.
 Hey,


it's
 a
 bit
 hot
 in
 here,
 isn't
 it?
 Oh,


it's
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you.
 I'm
 really


excited
 to
 be
 here
 in,
 you
 know,


Vancouver.
 What
 a
 lovely
 city,
 isn't


there?
 Do
 you
 live
 here?
 You
 know,
 no,
 I


don't
 do
 any
 of
 that
 because
 I
 want
 them


to
 have
 the
 why
 very
 very
 clearly


upfront.
 And
 in
 fact,
 when
 I'm
 doing
 my


my
 talks
 on
 listening,
 I
 walk
 on
 stage


and
 just
 say
 listen


and
 then
 stop
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 then


we
 talk
 about
 what's
 that?
 That's
 the


sound
 of
 listening.
 It's
 a
 very


important
 sound.
 Why
 is
 it
 important?


And
 so
 forth.
 So
 when
 you're
 starting


something,
 you
 can
 grab
 attention.
 You


can
 make
 a
 controversial
 statement
 of


some
 kind.
 Did
 you
 know
 this?
 Or
 you


know,
 here's
 something
 that
 you're
 going


to
 disagree
 with.
 You
 can
 ask
 a


question.
 You
 can
 give
 them
 a
 huge


result
 that
 they
 would
 like.
 Would
 you


like
 to
 dot
 dot
 dot?
 Whatever
 it
 is,


it's
 the
 why.
 And
 it's
 very
 important


that
 that's
 the
 pinnacle
 of
 your


pyramid.
 Everything
 flows
 from
 that.


Then
 I
 might
 make
 jokes.
 I
 might
 be,
 you


know,
 in
 my
 own
 little
 way
 gently


amusing,


>> but
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 crack
 gags.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 do
 routines.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


try
 and
 do,
 you
 know,
 standup
 because


that's
 not
 who
 I
 am.
 It
 would
 be


inauthentic.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 authenticity
 piece
 is


something
 that


it
 is


intuitive
 and
 it
 but
 it's
 also
 not


obvious
 and
 it's
 really
 difficult.
 One


question
 that
 I
 have
 for
 you
 that
 it
 can


be
 about
 authenticity,
 it
 can
 be
 about


other
 things
 as
 well
 is
 what
 when


someone
 else
 is
 speaking,
 what
 should
 we


be
 listening
 for?
 I
 talk
 about
 listening


positions
 and
 that's
 very
 important.


There
 are
 lots
 of
 ways
 you
 can
 listen


and
 there
 are
 many
 models
 of
 this
 out


there.
 So
 people
 talk
 about
 active


listening.
 I
 talk
 about
 conscious


listening.
 That's
 the
 thing
 I
 I
 like
 to


talk
 about
 because
 the
 whole


conversation
 to
 me
 is
 about


consciousness.
 And
 listening
 for
 is
 one


listening
 position.
 It
 tends
 to
 be
 what


I
 would
 call
 critical
 listening
 which
 is


what's
 in
 this
 for
 me?
 Where's
 the
 value


in
 this?
 Is
 this
 important?
 Is
 this


useful?
 Should
 I
 go
 somewhere
 else?
 You


know,
 um,
 and
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 I


mean,
 the
 most
 uncomfortable
 situation,


anybody
 who's
 been
 to,
 for
 example,
 an


exhibition,
 you
 get
 those
 conversations


where
 people
 are
 always
 looking
 over


your
 shoulder
 to
 see
 if
 there's
 somebody


more
 important
 that
 they
 should
 be


speaking
 to,


>> checking
 your
 badge,
 you
 know,
 are
 you


significant?
 That
 kind
 of
 that's
 a
 a


very
 hardedged
 critical
 listening.


>> There's
 nothing
 wrong
 with
 critical


listening.
 It's
 very
 useful
 in
 business,


but
 it
 may
 not
 be
 what
 you
 want
 to
 take


home.
 Where
 you
 might
 want
 to
 move
 into


empathic
 listening,
 which
 is
 feeling
 the


other
 person's
 feelings,
 listening
 with


your
 heart
 as
 well
 as
 your
 ears
 and
 your


eyes,
 and
 going
 onto
 their
 island,
 and


really
 seeking
 to
 understand
 what's


going
 on
 for
 them.
 You
 know,
 people
 say


there's
 three
 things
 we
 want
 in
 a


relationship.
 To
 be
 heard,
 to
 be


understood,
 and
 to
 be
 valued.
 And


empathic
 listening
 does
 all
 three
 of


those.
 But
 again,
 you
 wouldn't


necessarily
 want
 to
 do
 that
 at
 work
 the


whole
 time.
 Sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 be


hard
 or
 discipline
 people
 or
 just
 be


direct.
 And
 you
 know,
 empathic
 listening


would
 not
 work
 in
 the
 army,
 for
 example,


in
 the
 in
 the
 armed
 forces.
 Do
 what


you're
 told.


>> There's
 no
 empathy
 in
 that
 at
 all.
 So


listening
 positions,
 there
 are
 many,


many,
 many
 of
 them.
 You
 can
 create
 as


many
 as
 you
 like,
 but
 the
 key
 is
 to
 be


conscious
 of
 where
 you're
 listening


from.


Listening
 for
 is
 very
 useful
 sometimes.


Listening
 with
 listening
 out
 of
 for


example
 faith
 or
 fear
 or
 listening
 the


masculine
 feminine
 listening
 tends
 to


differ
 quite
 a
 lot
 as
 well.
 So
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 of
 listening.


>> The
 masculine
 and
 feminine
 listening
 I'm


not
 surprised
 that
 uh
 before
 you
 said


that
 it
 was
 a
 man
 who
 said
 you
 saved
 my


marriage
 with
 your
 with
 your
 listening


help.
 Um
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 definitely


a
 way
 in
 which
 we
 are
 socialized
 as
 men


to
 be
 talkers
 to
 be
 grabbing
 attention


rather
 than
 giving
 attention
 and
 paying


attention.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 books


about
 this
 and
 with
 listening
 I
 talk


about
 male
 listening
 tends
 to
 be


reductive
 that
 is
 to
 say
 for
 a
 point


>> to
 solve
 a
 problem
 to
 arrive
 at
 a
 given


destination
 there's
 a
 purpose
 to
 it


whereas
 female
 listening
 tends
 to
 be


more
 what
 I
 call
 expansive
 that
 is
 to


say
 there's
 no
 point
 to
 get
 to
 there's


no
 destination
 in
 mind
 it's
 enjoying
 the


journey
 with
 the
 person
 you're
 with


wherever
 it
 goes
 really
 and
 so
 if
 those


get
 confused.
 You
 get
 conversations
 like


she
 comes
 home
 and
 says,
 "Oh,
 darling,
 I


had
 a
 terrible
 day.
 This
 happened.
 This


happened.
 This
 happened."
 And
 he
 looks


up
 from
 the
 football
 game
 and
 says,


"Darling,
 have
 a
 bath.
 It
 always
 makes


you
 feel
 better."
 Now,
 in
 the
 male


world,
 that's
 problem
 solved.
 Back
 to


the
 football.
 In
 the
 female
 world,
 that


was
 not
 what
 she
 was
 looking
 for.
 She


was
 much
 more
 looking
 for,
 "Darling,
 sit


down,
 have
 a
 glass
 of
 wine,
 tell
 me
 all


about
 it."
 That's
 expansive
 listening.


So
 pro
 solving
 a
 problem
 can
 be
 very


useful
 sometimes,
 but
 we
 need
 to
 be


conscious
 of
 the
 listening
 position


we're
 in.
 And
 if
 we
 can
 move
 into
 the


other
 one,
 that
 can
 be
 the
 solution
 to
 a


lot
 of
 you
 never
 listen
 to
 me,
 which
 is


the
 biggest
 complaint
 in
 relationships.


>> I'm
 just
 curious.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 two


rapid
 fire
 kind
 of
 silly
 questions.
 Um


the
 first
 one
 is
 what
 is
 your
 favorite


sound?


>> Gentle
 rain
 on
 leaves
 outside
 the


window.
 And
 flip
 side,
 what
 is
 your


least
 favorite
 sound?
 What
 gets
 under


your
 skin
 and
 gives
 you
 the
 creepy


crawlies?


>> I
 think
 these
 days
 it
 is
 lots
 of
 people


talking
 at
 loud
 volume
 in
 a
 very
 echoey,


poorly
 designed
 room


>> where
 I'm
 trying
 to
 listen
 to
 somebody


and
 you
 know
 it's
 90
 dibels
 plus
 of


noise
 going
 on
 there.
 And
 I'm
 finding
 it


it's
 called
 the
 cocktail
 effect.
 It
 gets


worse
 as
 you
 get
 older.
 I
 find
 that
 very


challenging
 uh
 and
 also
 debilitating.


You
 know,
 noise
 does
 fatigue
 us.


stresses
 us
 and
 indeed
 if
 you're
 in
 that


kind
 of
 a
 situation
 for
 lengthy
 periods


of
 time
 it's
 increasing
 your
 risk
 of


heart
 attack.
 Um
 you
 know
 teachers
 work


in
 classrooms


which
 are
 quite
 noisy
 these
 days
 and
 it


may
 well
 be
 they're
 shortening
 their


lives
 by
 working
 in
 those
 classrooms
 at


65
 dibels
 which
 is
 not
 that
 loud.
 You'd


have
 to
 raise
 your
 voice
 to
 be
 heard
 but


it's
 not
 shouting
 loud.
 If
 that's
 the


noise
 level
 day
 after
 day
 your
 risk
 of


heart
 attack
 is
 elevated.
 lots
 of


research
 on
 this
 now.


>> So,
 we
 need
 to
 be
 careful
 about
 these


things
 and
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 casual


noise.
 Architects
 don't
 listen
 to
 the


buildings
 they
 make.
 You
 know,
 I
 have a


TED
 talk
 about
 that
 as
 well.
 And
 a
 plea


to
 architects
 to
 design
 with
 their
 ears.


That
 is
 the
 biggest
 thing
 that


frustrates
 me
 now
 is
 being
 in
 poorly


designed
 spaces
 and
 just
 getting


assailed
 by
 noise.


>> Julian
 Treasure,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


making
 the
 time
 to
 be
 on
 the
 show.
 It


was
 an
 absolute
 pleasure
 talking
 to
 you.


>> It's
 been
 my
 pleasure,
 Chris.
 Thank
 you.
