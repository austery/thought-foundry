[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Tuesday,


October
 21st,
 and
 well,
 we've
 got
 a


pretty
 interesting
 pre-market.
 Uh,
 in


terms
 of
 what's
 going
 on,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 different
 headlines,
 a
 lot
 of


different
 narratives,
 a
 lot
 of
 different


stories
 that
 we'll
 get
 to
 cover.
 I
 think


the
 most
 important
 thing,
 even
 though


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 think
 the


thing
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 might
 be


seeing
 right
 now
 is
 uh
 silver
 getting


hit
 getting
 hit
 bad.
 5%
 down
 on
 silver


and
 gold
 is
 going
 down
 with
 it
 by
 about


3%
 and
 copper
 the
 same
 way
 as
 well.


You're
 seeing
 the
 commodities
 for
 the


first
 time
 in
 almost
 I
 would
 say
 a
 month


actually
 having
 like
 a
 meaningful
 hit
 uh


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Usually
 these
 things


are
 pretty
 green
 and
 so
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 wondering
 so
 far
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Hey,
 is
 this
 uh
 is
 this
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 commodities
 officially


taking
 a
 breather?
 potentially
 not


continue
 to
 go
 up
 one
 or
 two%
 every
 day.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 But
 we're
 going


to
 see.
 Isn't
 that
 what
 your
 uncle
 is


into?
 My
 uncle
 texted
 me
 this
 morning


saying
 he
 literally
 sold
 all
 of
 his


silver
 yesterday.
 He
 literally
 sold
 all


of
 his
 silver
 yesterday.
 He
 was
 like,


"Dude,
 I'm
 pretty
 good
 at
 timing."
 I
 was


like,
 "That's
 an
 impressive
 sell.
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 lie.
 If
 you
 sold
 at
 54
 and


this
 thing's
 now
 at
 49,
 that's


impressive."
 He
 still
 has
 a
 lot
 of


copper,
 though.
 But
 he
 got
 into
 copper


really
 early.
 So,
 um,
 he's
 in
 that


trade.
 But
 yeah,
 even
 I
 wake
 woke
 up


this
 morning
 and
 I
 saw
 it
 and I
 was
 like


that's
 a
 nasty
 cuz
 you
 know
 when
 if


silver
 loses
 certain
 key
 levels
 it's
 not


that
 easy
 for
 it
 to
 just
 get
 it
 but
 it's


not
 like
 a
 stock
 where
 they
 can
 announce


something
 and
 then
 boom
 it
 goes
 back


like
 commodities
 are
 more
 based
 on
 macro


cycles
 supply
 and
 demand
 and
 not


necessarily
 earnings
 growth
 right
 there


is
 no
 earnings.
 So
 it
 would
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 if
 this
 5%
 draw
 down


is
 just
 hey
 it
 was
 running
 hot
 took
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 breather
 or
 if
 it's
 like


all
 right
 we're
 done
 with
 commodities


and
 we're
 moving
 on.
 But
 we're
 going
 to


keep
 attention
 to
 that
 story
 see
 what


we've
 got
 going
 on
 and
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 updates
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI.
 The
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


published
 a
 massive,
 massive
 story
 last


night
 around
 Nvidia
 Open.
 So,
 we'll
 talk


about
 that
 and
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going


on
 there.
 S&P
 500
 67162
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 We
 closed
 above
 671


yesterday,
 which
 was
 very
 bullish
 to


see.
 Uh,
 we
 are
 $2
 away
 from
 all-time


highs
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 even
 in
 the
 midst


of
 some
 of
 the
 volatility
 we've
 had
 in


October.
 And
 we've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 the


macro
 stats
 for
 October
 that
 we'll
 take


a
 look
 at.
 But
 uh
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 that


the
 S&P
 500
 is
 at least
 doing
 okay
 and


the
 broader
 markets
 are
 doing
 all
 right.


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 as
 well.
 Bitcoin


basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day
 109,
 Ethereum


3,800.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy
 there.
 Both
 of


them
 have
 been
 relatively
 flat
 from


yesterday.
 The
 Mac
 7s
 have
 done
 pretty


okay
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days.
 Now


Amazon
 218
 even
 after
 the
 massive
 AWS


outage.
 Meta
 back
 to
 736.
 Meta
 was
 at


690
 last
 week.
 Google
 breaking
 above
 255


once
 again.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 the


Max
 7s
 are
 necessarily
 in
 that
 bad
 of
 a


situation.
 Tesla
 right
 here
 at
 446.
 We


will
 have
 Netflix
 earnings
 after
 the


bell.
 We're
 going
 to
 still
 have


technical
 Tuesday
 today.
 We'll
 do


Netflix
 for
 like
 20
 minutes
 and
 then


we'll
 have
 Jason
 on
 and
 we'll
 do


technical
 Tuesday.
 But
 uh
 Netflix
 12:45.


I
 mean,
 it's
 basically
 where
 it
 was
 at


before
 the
 last
 earnings.
 It's
 still
 up


about
 30%
 for
 the
 year.
 So
 maybe
 this
 is


the
 breakout
 quarter,
 but
 Netflix
 will


be
 having
 today
 and
 then
 Tesla
 will
 be


happening
 tomorrow.


and
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there
 and


see
 what
 happens.
 Aman
 is
 on
 CNBC.


Really?
 Did
 Bill
 Aman
 go
 on
 CNBC
 today?


Uh,
 let
 me
 see


if
 he's
 on.
 Oh,
 wow.
 He
 is
 on.
 Okay,
 so


let's
 uh
 let's
 let's
 listen
 to
 Aman
 for


a
 little
 bit.
 See,
 get
 some
 of
 his


perspectives
 and
 then
 I'll
 get
 into
 all


my
 stories.
 But
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right


here
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.


>> York,
 I
 care
 about
 this
 city.
 I've
 put
 a


lot
 of
 energy
 in
 keeping
 this
 city
 safe.


um
 you
 know
 the
 polls
 the
 facts
 just


tell
 me
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 as
 a
 fiduciary


for
 the
 you
 know
 the
 shareholders
 of
 the


company
 and
 if
 you
 can
 locate
 the


business
 in
 Miami
 and
 eliminate
 21


percentage
 points
 of
 corporate
 tax
 he's


going
 to
 do
 that
 right
 so
 the
 you
 know


the
 matching
 New
 Jersey
 and
 forgetting


that
 there's
 also
 New
 York
 City
 uh
 you


know
 uh
 New
 York
 City
 and
 New
 York
 State


uh
 you
 know
 taxes
 here
 is
 just
 going
 to


destroy
 the
 city


>> there
 are
 national
 Republicans


they
 like
 New
 York
 but
 they
 don't
 live


here
 and
 they
 think
 Republicans
 win
 the


midterms
 if
 this
 guy
 gets
 elected
 and


becomes
 that


>> the
 Democrats
 have
 a
 real
 problem


whether
 they
 endorse
 this
 guy
 or
 whether


they
 accept
 him
 like
 because
 it's
 just


>> okay
 so
 it's
 more
 politics
 I
 thought
 it


would
 be
 business
 and
 stuff
 about
 the


markets
 he's
 trying
 to
 get
 Zohan
 to
 not


get
 elected


it
 is
 what
 it
 is
 dude
 that
 New
 York
 City


election
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most


anticipated
 elections
 I
 personally


believe
 Zoran's
 going
 to
 in
 because
 I


don't
 know
 how
 Quomo
 beats
 him
 in
 the


polls.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 I
 think


what
 November
 4th,
 November
 5th,
 we'll


see
 what
 happens.


And
 New
 York
 will
 have
 to
 live
 with
 the


choices
 that
 they
 make.
 So,
 I
 guess
 uh
 I


guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends


up
 playing
 out
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks.
 I


am
 curious
 what
 this
 does
 to
 like


national
 uh
 politics
 when
 New
 York
 City,


you
 know,
 New
 York
 City,
 San
 Francisco,


Chicago,
 these
 are
 the
 major
 cities
 that


kind
 of
 set
 the
 tone
 in
 certain
 areas.


So,
 I
 would
 be
 curious
 to
 see
 if
 he
 is


elected,
 kind
 of
 how
 the
 national


political
 landscape
 evolves,
 but
 we'll


be
 covering
 that
 in
 November
 when
 that


ends
 up
 actually
 happening.
 Okay,
 so


let's
 get
 into
 our
 macro
 stories
 for
 the


day
 and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 We
 also
 had
 a
 ton
 of
 earnings


this
 morning.
 Coca-Cola,
 GM.
 So,
 we'll


get
 into
 all
 those
 earnings
 as
 well
 and


we'll
 uh
 we'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 there.


I
 think
 let's
 start
 off
 with
 the
 uh
 the


Nvidia
 news.
 I
 think
 let's
 start
 off


with
 the
 Invid
 News
 because
 I
 read
 the


story
 last
 night
 and
 I
 could
 not
 believe


what
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 said,
 but


uh
 it
 really
 does
 sound
 more
 legit
 than


not
 when
 you
 think
 of
 it.
 So
 this
 was


the
 story
 that
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


published
 last
 night
 and
 the
 idea
 was


hey
 how
 Sam
 Alman
 tied
 tech's
 biggest


players
 to
 open
 AI.
 The
 thesis
 of
 the


story
 essentially
 being
 uh
 that
 Sam


Alolman
 is
 making
 sure
 that
 Nvidia,
 AMD,


Broadcom,
 Oracle,
 all
 these
 companies,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 succeed
 without
 him


and
 he's
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 OpenAI


becomes
 too
 big
 to
 fail
 in
 case
 they


ever
 think
 that
 OpenAI
 could
 fail.
 It's


actually
 a
 very
 smart
 strategic
 move


that
 uh
 Sam
 Alman
 is
 planning,
 but
 it's


also
 kind
 of
 crazy
 to
 see
 how
 he's
 doing


it.
 Let
 me
 read
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 this


part
 of
 the
 article
 which
 I
 thought
 was


fascinating.
 So
 on
 June
 27th,
 the
 tech


site
 the
 information
 published
 a
 report


saying
 that
 opening
 II
 had
 begun
 renting


Google's
 TPU
 chips
 to
 powert
 causing


something
 of
 a
 stir
 inside
 Nvidia's


Santa
 Clara
 headquarters.
 I
 think
 I
 was


live
 that
 day
 when
 that
 when
 that
 story


actually
 broke.
 At
 the
 time
 it
 was
 well


known
 that
 Openi
 was
 looking
 for
 ways
 to


reduce
 its
 reliance
 on
 Nvidia.
 The


startup
 was
 busy
 designing
 its
 own


custom
 chip
 with
 Broadcom
 and
 was
 also


taking
 a
 close
 look
 at
 the
 chips
 offered


by
 Nvidia
 rival
 AMD.
 That
 spring,
 OpenAI


also
 signed
 its
 first
 cloud
 contract


with
 Google,
 raising
 the
 spectre
 that
 it


might
 begin
 using
 its
 chips
 as
 well.


After
 the
 story
 was
 published,
 Jensen


called
 Altman
 asking
 him
 if
 it
 was
 true


and
 signaled
 that
 he
 was
 open
 to
 getting


the
 talks
 back
 on
 track,
 according
 to


people
 familiar
 with
 the
 matter.
 Hang


realized
 that
 Nvidia
 could
 help
 OpenAI


by
 making
 a
 direct
 investment
 in
 the


company.
 A
 person
 who
 spoke
 to
 him
 said


Nvidia's
 exac
 account
 then
 posted
 a


screenshot,
 if
 you
 guys
 remember
 that,


of
 an
 article
 when
 OpenAI
 denied
 having


plans
 to
 use
 Google's
 in-house
 ship.


Nvidia
 and
 Nvidia
 ended
 up
 signing
 an


agreement
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 to
 lease
 up


to
 5
 million
 of
 its
 ships
 OpenAI,


costing
 350
 billion
 by
 today's


standards.
 It
 also
 has
 the
 right
 to


invest
 up
 to
 a
 hundred
 billion
 to
 help


the
 startup
 pay
 for
 a
 deal.


So
 what
 happened?
 Basically,
 if
 you
 go


further
 into
 the
 story,
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 says
 Sam
 Alman
 tried
 to
 make


Jensen
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 FOMO.
 And
 the


idea
 of
 the
 FOMO
 was
 exploring
 ways
 that


they
 could
 get
 off
 the
 Nvidia
 reliance


that
 they're
 on.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


competitors
 to
 that
 was
 Google's
 TPUs,


primarily
 because
 Google's
 TPUs
 are
 not


like
 massive
 massive
 competitors
 to


Nvidia
 GPUs,
 but
 the
 the
 threat
 of
 them


becoming
 competitors
 is
 something
 Jensen


probably
 doesn't
 want
 to
 deal
 with.
 And


if
 one
 of
 your
 biggest
 customers
 is


going
 to
 use
 those
 TPUs,
 well,
 that'll


warrant
 a
 phone
 call.
 That
 will


definitely
 warrant
 a
 phone
 call.
 And
 so,


uh,
 Sam
 gets
 Jensen
 to
 get
 scared
 of


Google,
 then
 gets
 him
 to
 invest
 a


hundred
 billion
 and
 tells
 him,
 "Okay,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 working


with
 Google."
 And
 then
 three
 months


later,
 the
 deal
 is
 announced.
 After
 the


deal
 is
 made,
 Sam
 went
 and
 gets
 deals


with
 Broadcom
 and
 AMD.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


you
 can
 tell
 Jensen
 didn't
 know
 about


it.
 He
 was
 on
 CNBC
 two
 weeks
 ago
 and


they
 asked
 him,
 "What
 do
 you
 think
 about


the
 AMD
 deal?"
 And
 he,
 you
 know,
 he
 he


basically
 threw
 a
 lot
 of
 shade
 and
 said,


"I
 don't
 know
 why
 you
 would
 give
 up
 10%


of
 your
 company
 if
 you
 were
 so
 confident


in
 your
 chip."
 And
 you
 could
 tell
 that


Sam
 Alman
 probably
 didn't
 tell
 him,


"Hey,
 by
 the
 way,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 get


some
 more
 deals
 because,
 you
 know,
 that


wouldn't
 probably
 get
 the
 hundred


billion
 dollar
 deal
 done
 officially
 that


Jensen
 made
 with
 him."
 Uh,
 but
 he
 gets


that
 deal
 secured
 and
 then
 goes
 and
 gets


other
 deals.


The
 punchline
 is
 that
 Altman
 is


ruthlessly
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 if


AI
 ends
 up
 becoming
 the
 transformational


technology
 we
 all
 think
 it
 can
 become,


he
 is
 going
 to
 be
 at
 the
 center
 of
 it.
 I


think
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 scary
 and
 amazing


to
 witness
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 The
 reason


it's
 scary
 is
 because
 OpenAI
 cannot


fail.
 These
 guys
 simply
 cannot
 fail.
 And


if
 they
 fail,
 the
 the
 lynch
 pin
 of
 how


we
 think
 of
 AI
 as
 an
 ecosystem
 probably


fa
 ceases
 to
 exist.
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got


other
 competitors
 that
 are
 out
 there


that
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 make
 a
 good


attempt
 at
 making
 AI
 real,
 but
 OpenAI
 is


the
 one
 that
 is
 intertwined
 with
 these


billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 contracts
 with


Oracle,
 AMD,
 Nvidia,
 etc.
 And
 so,
 we're


going
 to
 really
 have
 to
 see
 how
 this


ends
 up
 uh
 playing
 out.
 But,


nonetheless,
 that's
 what
 you've
 got
 with


OpenAI.


And
 ultimately,
 you
 know,
 Nvidia
 is
 uh


is
 at
 the
 center
 of
 it
 now.
 Whether


Jensen
 likes
 it
 or
 not,
 he
 is
 at
 the


center
 of
 how
 this
 plays
 out.
 Nvidia


right
 there
 18305
 slightly
 green
 in
 the


pre-markets
 as
 well.
 Isn't
 uh
 isn't
 this


what
 you
 want
 in
 a
 CEO?
 Yes.
 I
 mean


technically
 that
 is
 what
 you
 want
 in
 a


CEO
 but
 it's
 also
 one
 of
 those
 things


where
 you
 know
 he
 gets
 a
 reputation
 of


being
 a
 snake.
 So
 by
 the
 way
 2880
 trying


to
 get
 up
 to
 29.
 It
 was
 up
 9%
 yesterday.


He
 gets
 that
 reputation
 of
 being
 a


snake.
 And
 you
 know
 sometimes
 a
 snake


helps
 you
 secure
 deals
 in
 business.


Other
 times
 it
 just
 makes
 people
 not


want
 to
 work
 with
 you.
 And
 you
 know


maybe
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 scenarios


where
 people
 might
 not
 want
 to
 work
 with


them.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it's


freaking
 OpenAI.
 They
 have
 the
 best
 LLM,


or
 I
 should
 say
 the
 fastest
 growing
 LLM


that's
 out
 there.
 It's
 hard
 to
 imagine


people
 don't
 want
 to
 work
 with
 OpenAI.


And
 so,
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 fascinating


to
 see.
 I
 think
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 all
 of


our
 portfolios,
 OpenAI
 does
 need
 to
 work


whether
 you
 like
 SAM
 or
 not.
 But
 they


are
 too
 intertwined
 with
 Nvidia,


Broadcom,
 and
 AMD
 and
 a
 host
 of
 other
 I


mean,
 Oracle's
 literal
 RPO
 growth,
 the


300
 the
 the
 500
 billion
 in
 RPO,
 300


billion
 out
 of
 the
 500
 billion
 was


OpenAI.
 If
 not,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 200


billion,
 which
 is
 still
 good
 remaining


performance
 obligation
 growth,
 but
 it's


not
 the
 type
 of
 explosive
 growth
 that


brought
 the
 market
 cap
 up
 to
 almost
 a


trillion.
 So,
 this
 thing
 has
 to
 work
 for


OpenAI.
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 we're
 likely


going
 to
 have
 some
 issues.
 Um,
 let
 me
 go


to
 what
 Elon
 said
 yesterday.
 So,


remember
 that
 clip
 I
 said
 about
 Sean


Duffy
 basically
 uh
 opening
 up
 the
 SpaceX


contract?
 Here's
 the
 clip,
 and
 then
 Elon


actually
 responded
 to
 it
 this
 morning


for
 the
 moon
 contract
 with
 SpaceX.
 Now,


SpaceX
 had
 the
 contract
 for
 Artemis
 3.


Um,
 they're
 be,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 love


SpaceX.
 It's
 an
 amazing
 company.
 The


problem
 is
 they're
 behind.
 They
 pushed


their
 timelines
 out
 and
 we're
 in
 a
 race


against
 China.
 The
 president
 and
 I
 want


to
 get
 to
 the
 moon
 in
 this
 uh


president's
 term.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 open


up
 uh
 the
 the
 contract.
 I'm
 going
 to
 let


other
 uh
 other
 uh
 space
 companies


compete
 with
 SpaceX
 like
 like
 Blue


Origin.
 Um,
 and
 again,
 whatever
 one
 can


get
 us
 there
 first,
 um,
 to
 the
 moon,


we're
 going
 to
 take.
 And
 if
 SpaceX
 is


behind,
 but
 Blue
 Origin
 can
 do
 it
 before


them,
 good
 on
 Blue
 Origin.
 But,
 by
 the


way,
 we
 also
 might
 have
 two
 companies


that
 get
 that
 can
 get
 us
 back
 to
 the


moon
 um,
 in
 2028.
 But
 again,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 wait
 for
 one
 company.
 We're


going
 to
 push
 this
 forward
 and
 win
 the


second
 space
 race
 against
 the
 Chinese,


get
 back
 to
 the
 moon,
 set
 up
 a
 camp,
 a


base,
 and
 from
 there,
 it's
 going
 to


we're
 going
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 we
 can


actually
 get
 to
 Mars.
 Now,
 SpaceX
 had


>> so
 that's
 bullish
 Rocket
 Lab,


potentially
 bullish
 Blue
 Origin,
 uh,
 you


know,
 bullish
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other
 space


companies
 that
 are
 smaller
 than
 my
 bid


for
 it.
 Elon's
 response
 was,


"Why
 are
 you
 gay?


This
 is
 the
 world's
 richest
 man,
 folks.


This
 is
 the
 world's
 richest
 man.
 You
 got


to
 love
 it.
 You
 got
 to
 love
 it,
 bro.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we
 will
 have
 in
 history
 a


person
 of
 his
 wealth
 being
 able
 to


respond
 to
 these
 highle
 officials
 like


this
 ever
 again
 in
 history.
 So
 Elon's


response
 is
 like,
 "Bro,
 like
 I
 know


you're
 trying
 to
 seem
 like
 you're
 uh


embracing
 metocracy
 by
 opening
 up
 the


ability
 for
 other
 companies
 to
 compete


with
 SpaceX,
 but
 you
 realize
 if
 SpaceX


is
 slow
 on
 the
 contract,
 you
 think
 any


of
 these
 other
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 be


faster
 than
 us?"
 I
 think
 that's
 what


Elon's
 basically
 implying
 right
 here.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 we're
 gonna
 see
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out,
 but
 I
 did


think
 this
 was
 funny.
 So,
 this
 was


Elon's
 response
 as
 a
 result
 to
 what
 uh


what
 Sean
 Duffy
 said,
 which
 it
 also
 does


make
 sense,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 going


back
 to
 the
 moon,
 we
 haven't
 been
 there


in
 54
 years.
 It's
 not
 the
 easiest
 thing


to
 do.
 So,
 SpaceX
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 behind


on
 their
 goals.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 I'm
 not


sure
 how
 many
 other
 space
 companies
 are


that
 much
 more
 advanced
 than
 SpaceX
 to


be
 able
 to
 figure
 this
 out
 quicker.


Maybe
 some
 of
 them
 are.
 We're
 going to


see.
 But
 overall,
 it
 does
 seem
 like


SpaceX
 should
 still
 have
 a
 good
 shot
 of


ending
 up
 to
 get
 this
 deal.
 So,
 that's


what
 we
 got
 there
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Elon


and
 uh
 and
 SpaceX.
 All right,
 let's
 get


into
 some
 macro
 news
 because
 we
 got
 a


bunch
 bunch
 of
 other
 things
 happening
 in


the
 macro.
 First
 of
 all,
 let's
 just
 get


through
 earnings.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of


earnings.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 any
 of
 you
 guys


own
 these
 names
 in
 the
 chat,
 but
 let's


go
 through
 them
 one
 by
 one.
 Most
 of
 them


I'm
 looking
 at
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom,
 which
 is
 really
 good.
 So,
 let's


pull
 these
 up
 right
 here.
 So,
 first,


Galaxy
 Digital.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys,
 or
 not
 a
 lot,
 but
 a
 decent
 chunk


of
 you
 own
 this
 one.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this.
 EPS
 is
 up
 a,000%
 year-over-year.


They
 beat
 by
 261%.


Uh,
 and
 then
 revenue
 is
 also
 up


substantially.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 235%


year-over-year.
 They
 beat
 that
 by
 90%.


Galaxy
 is
 up
 9%
 on
 the
 day.
 Why
 is
 this


happening?
 Well,
 the
 AI
 HPC
 market
 is


becoming
 massive.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 these


Bitcoin
 miners
 that
 have
 pivoted
 their


business
 are
 starting
 to
 lean
 in
 to
 that


growth.
 And
 so,
 these
 are
 just
 crazy


numbers.
 I
 mean,
 beating
 EPS
 by
 80


cents,
 beating
 revenue
 by
 uh
 9
 minus
 15.


That's
 basically
 what
 14
 billion,
 29


billion
 versus
 15
 billion
 expected.
 It's


quite
 incredible.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


you're
 seeing
 the
 stock
 price
 get
 some


momentum.
 Then
 you
 got
 Coca-Cola,
 82


cents
 versus
 78
 cents,
 that's
 a
 beat
 by


5%,
 12.4
 versus
 12.4
 billion
 on
 revenue.


That's
 a
 slight
 beat.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 4%


year-over-year.
 EPS
 is
 up
 6%


year-over-year.
 Coca-Cola
 is
 up
 3%.


Coca-Cola
 is
 up
 3%.
 So
 you
 got
 those
 two


earnings
 going
 out
 pretty
 well.
 Then
 you


have
 3M,
 another
 company,
 EPS
 219
 versus


207.
 That's
 a
 beat
 by
 6%.
 Revenue
 6.3


versus
 6.25.
 That
 is
 a
 beat
 by
 1%.


Revenue
 is
 up
 4%
 year-over-year.
 EPS
 is


up
 11%
 year-over-year.
 3M
 is
 up
 1%.


In
 the
 pre-market
 then
 you
 had
 GM.
 This


was
 actually
 a
 pretty
 good
 quarter.
 They


beat
 by
 21%
 280
 versus
 232.
 Uh
 so
 they


beat
 by
 about
 40
 cents
 right
 there.
 And


then
 48.5
 versus
 45.3.
 They
 beat
 by
 7%


on
 revenue.
 Revenue
 is
 still
 down


year-over-year
 and
 so
 is
 EPS,
 but
 they


did
 beat
 on
 both
 of
 those
 metrics
 for


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 against
 the


street
 expectations.
 GM,
 wow,
 I
 actually


did
 not
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 all
 morning.


Up
 11%
 on
 the
 day.
 11%


on
 the
 day.
 Now,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 expecting
 an
 11%
 move
 or
 a


10%
 move.
 I
 think the
 implied
 volatility


is
 like
 an
 8.2%
 for
 Tesla
 going
 into


tomorrow's
 earnings.
 Um,
 it's
 just
 the


expectations
 might
 be
 a
 little
 higher.


So,
 you
 know,
 GM
 had
 some
 pretty
 high


expectations.
 They
 came
 out
 and
 they


beat
 them.
 So,
 now
 it's
 just
 the


question
 of
 can
 Tesla
 beat
 some
 of
 those


expectations.
 And
 if
 they
 do,
 maybe
 that


one
 gets
 some
 love.
 And
 then
 you
 have


General
 Electric
 beat
 by
 13%
 on
 EPS,
 166


versus
 147,
 11.3
 versus
 10.4
 billion.


EPS
 is
 up
 44%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is


up
 26%
 year-over-year.
 The
 punchline
 to


all
 these
 earnings,
 GE,
 is
 up
 2.4%.
 is


that
 so
 far
 pretty
 much
 every
 company


that
 matters
 has
 either
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 line
 or
 they've
 slightly


came
 in
 line
 with
 expectations
 on
 one
 or


the
 other.
 Very
 few
 of
 them
 have


actually
 missed
 a
 revenue
 and
 earnings


estimate.
 And
 this
 is
 we're
 talking


about
 Coca-Cola,
 we're
 talking
 about


Bitcoin
 miners,
 we're
 talking
 about


banks,
 we're
 talking
 about


semiconductors
 with
 TSM
 and
 ASML.


You've
 got
 a
 wide
 diversity
 of
 all
 these


different
 companies
 that
 are
 putting
 up


the
 earnings
 growth
 that
 we
 saw
 in
 Q2,


which
 was
 quite
 phenomenal
 across
 the


board,
 beating
 by
 about
 almost
 8.5%.


If
 that
 continues
 in
 Q3,
 I
 think
 we
 have


some
 momentum.
 I
 think
 we
 have
 some


momentum.
 The
 other
 big
 company
 that
 we


had
 today
 was
 Eleven
 Health,
 another


healthcare
 company.
 They
 beat
 by
 22%
 on


EPS
 603
 versus
 494
 and
 then
 50
 versus


49.5
 billion.
 That
 stock
 I
 believe
 is


also


up
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Yeah,
 up
 about
 2%


as
 well.


Not
 too
 bad.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 We're
 getting


a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 put
 up
 some


numbers
 and
 those
 numbers
 are
 resulting


in
 some
 decent
 earnings
 growth
 across


the
 board.
 Wow.
 We
 got
 a
 headline
 right


here.
 The
 Saudi
 prince
 is
 going
 to
 be


visiting
 the
 White
 House
 on
 November


18th.


Huh.


Wow.
 Oh,
 Bin
 Salman's
 coming
 to
 the


White
 House.
 Last
 time
 he
 came,
 you
 guys


remember,
 last
 time
 he
 came
 was
 uh
 they


they
 signed
 $150
 billion
 defense
 uh


contract
 and
 uh
 the
 the the
 Saudis


basically
 bought
 our
 tanks
 and
 guns
 and


weapons
 and
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.
 And
 he


was
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 with
 Trump
 and


Trump
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 just


peanuts
 for
 you.
 You
 can
 even
 buy
 more."


Looks
 like
 he's
 coming
 back
 November


18th.
 November
 18th
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 Tuesday.
 All right.


So,
 you
 got
 the
 Saudis
 coming
 back
 to


the
 US
 and
 hopefully
 we're
 going to
 get


some
 more
 deals
 that
 are
 announced


uh
 with
 the
 Saudis,
 particularly
 in


regards
 to
 AI.
 Rathon
 had
 earnings
 today


as
 well.
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 Rathon
 had


earnings
 today.
 Rathon,


wow,
 5.28%.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Looks
 like


Rathon
 had
 a
 double
 beat.
 I
 didn't
 even


see
 the
 earnings,
 but
 looks
 like
 Rathon


as
 well
 had
 a
 double
 beat.
 So,
 again,


you're
 just
 seeing
 more
 and
 more


excitement
 across
 the
 board
 on
 these


earnings.
 Yeah,
 revenue
 22.4.
 4
 versus


21.7
 and
 then
 uh
 EPS
 170
 versus
 141


that's
 up
 17%
 year-over-year.
 Revenues


up
 12%
 year-over-year.
 Both
 of
 these
 are


beating
 whether
 it's
 defense,
 Coca-Cola,


semiconductors,
 Bitcoin
 miners,
 banks.
 I


mean,
 you're
 just
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


different
 industries
 put
 up
 the
 numbers


that
 really
 do
 matter.


And
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 EOS,
 this


one's
 running
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 I


don't
 know
 the
 headline
 on
 this
 one.
 EOS


is
 up
 19%.
 It
 was
 actually
 down
 19%
 last


week.
 I
 think
 on
 like
 a
 random
 Tuesday


it
 got
 hit
 when
 American
 Batteries
 got


hit.
 The
 news
 is
 they're
 expanding
 their


Pennsylvania
 operations
 with
 a
 24


million
 stateback
 package
 to
 build
 a
 new


432,000
 feet
 facility
 in
 Marshall


Township.
 The
 project
 will
 boost
 battery


production
 to
 8
 gawatts
 a
 year.
 Wow.


Support
 a
 thousand
 jobs
 and
 advance


their
 zincbased
 long
 duration
 energy


storage
 tech
 as
 a
 part
 of
 their
 newest


project.


All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 If
 you
 are
 an


EOSE,
 congratulations.
 This
 one
 is


definitely
 a
 volatile
 name
 that
 looks


like
 a
 pretty
 damn
 good
 deal
 they
 got


this
 morning,
 especially
 because
 it's


backed
 by
 the
 state
 itself.
 And
 8


gawatts
 a
 year
 of
 battery
 production
 is


quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 if
 they
 can
 get


that
 out
 there.
 But


looks
 like
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 news,
 one


of
 the
 headlines
 that's
 getting
 it
 to


get
 some
 momentum.
 They're
 meeting
 with


Governor
 Shapiro
 today.
 Okay.
 Well,
 that


also


should
 be
 helping
 them
 as
 well.
 Um,
 why


are
 you
 guys
 saying
 Michael
 J.
 Fox


passed
 away
 in
 the
 chat?


Is
 that
 is
 that
 true?
 Because
 I
 don't


see
 any
 headline
 saying
 Michael
 J.
 Fox


passed
 away.
 Can
 we
 can
 we
 not
 joke


about
 people
 passing
 away,
 please?
 Like,


I
 get
 the
 trolling
 is
 fun,
 but
 can
 we


can
 we
 not
 joke
 about
 that?
 Like,
 can
 we


have
 some
 line
 that
 we
 that
 we
 don't


cross?
 Okay,
 he
 didn't,
 right?
 Because
 I


just
 searched
 it
 up
 and
 I
 don't
 see
 that


either.
 Yeah.
 Can
 we
 please
 not
 joke


about
 people
 dying?
 That's
 uh
 like
 not


the
 the
 funnest


thing
 to
 do
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 then
 have


to
 see
 if
 that's
 true
 or
 not.
 All right,


cool.
 So,
 Michael
 J.
 Fox
 did
 not
 die.


Good.
 You
 know,
 Back
 to
 the
 Future.
 I
 I


I
 don't
 watch
 a
 lot
 of
 movies.
 I
 watched


it
 last
 year
 and
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 it.
 I


enjoyed
 Back
 to
 the
 Future
 2
 as
 well.


And
 then
 I
 didn't
 see
 the
 third
 one


because
 the
 third
 one
 looked
 like
 it
 was


some
 cowboy
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 don't


really
 like
 cowboys
 on
 it.
 But
 but
 the


first
 two
 were
 really
 good
 and
 I
 only


watched
 it
 because
 I
 had
 a
 Dan
 Ives


moment
 with
 Vlad.
 I
 asked
 Vlad
 on
 the


podcast
 back
 in
 March
 of
 2024.
 What's


your
 favorite
 movie?
 He
 said
 Back
 to
 the


Future.
 And
 I
 just
 nodded
 my
 head.
 I
 was


like
 classic.
 That
 was
 great.
 And
 then
 I


had
 to
 I
 couldn't
 lie
 to
 Vlad.
 I
 had
 to


watch
 it.
 And
 then
 I
 tweeted
 that
 I


watched
 it
 in
 like
 April
 of
 2024
 and


Vlad
 commented
 under.
 He
 was
 like,
 "You


should
 watch
 the
 Broadway
 special
 too


and
 you
 should
 watch
 the
 second
 one."
 I


was like,
 "Yep,
 I
 will.
 I
 will
 do
 that.


I
 will
 do
 that.
 Mr.
 Mr.
 Teniff."
 All


right.
 Goldman
 Sach
 CEO
 David
 Salvin.


They
 crushed
 earnings
 last
 week
 yet
 to


say
 about
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the
 state
 of


AI
 and
 the
 markets.


>> Bubbles
 just
 over
 the
 last
 week.
 Bubbles


in
 AI,
 bubbles
 in
 markets.
 You
 don't


particularly
 like
 that
 term.
 It's
 not


one
 you
 want
 to
 use
 yourself.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


like
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 overdramatic.


>> Bubble
 and
 bubbles.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 looking
 at
 tech


multiples
 and
 trying
 to
 put
 tech


multiples
 in
 a
 historical
 context.
 you


know,
 I've
 looked
 at
 um
 a
 variety
 of


datas,
 a
 variety
 of
 data
 on
 public


company
 tech
 multiples
 and
 you
 know,


also
 private
 capital
 formation
 for
 tech


companies
 and
 it,
 you
 know,
 it
 strikes


me
 that,
 you
 know,
 that
 the
 multiples


are
 kind
 of
 75th
 percentile
 or
 80


percentile.
 So
 there's
 no
 question,
 you


know,
 we're
 somewhere
 in
 a
 cycle
 where


the
 values
 are
 are
 higher,
 but
 the


growth
 opportunity
 coming
 from
 AI
 is


significant.
 But
 I'm,
 you
 know,
 I'm


certainly
 in
 the
 camp
 that
 they're
 going


to
 be
 winners
 and
 losers.
 capital
 has


been
 allocated
 to
 companies
 that
 are


going
 to
 be
 hugely
 important
 companies


and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 allocated
 to


companies
 that
 um
 that
 ultimately
 you


know
 won't
 make
 it
 or
 won't
 you
 know


won't
 succeed
 in
 that
 context
 and


ultimately
 whenever
 we
 have
 a
 new


technology
 especially
 at
 scale
 and
 you


have
 significant
 capital
 formation


around
 it
 you
 know
 they're
 going
 to
 be


winners
 or
 losers
 we're
 not
 smart
 enough


you
 know
 to
 pick
 pick
 them
 all
 and


ultimately
 there's
 you
 know
 there's
 a


rebalancing
 but
 I
 think
 the
 long-term


trends
 around
 this
 technology
 the


opportunity
 for
 productivity
 gains
 for


some
 great
 companies
 to
 be
 formed
 is


really
 quite
 exciting
 How
 about
 how


you're
 using
 it
 internally
 at
 Goldman


Sachs
 because
 you've
 made
 a
 lot
 of


comments
 in
 the
 past
 about
 how
 this
 can


really
 do
 the
 work
 for
 investment


bankers
 much
 faster.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 there
 there
 are
 couple


of
 base
 ways
 that
 we're
 using
 it.
 We're


very
 focused
 on
 this.
 The
 first
 is
 we've


always
 I
 mean
 since
 I
 started
 40
 some


years
 ago,
 we
 get
 technology
 tools
 into


the
 hands
 of
 really
 smart
 people
 to
 make


them
 more
 productive.
 So
 I
 always
 joke


about
 doing
 a
 common
 stock
 comparison
 40


years
 ago.
 It
 took
 six
 hours.
 you
 had
 to


go
 to
 the
 library,
 go
 get
 microfich
 to


get
 back
 issues
 of
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal.
 Now
 somebody
 can
 do
 it
 in


seconds.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 we
 don't
 have
 a


lot
 of
 very
 smart
 young
 people
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 work.
 They're
 just
 doing


different
 work
 than
 they
 did
 when
 I


started
 40
 years
 ago.
 And
 so
 we
 continue


to
 get
 these
 tools
 into
 the
 hands
 of
 our


very
 smart
 people
 and
 it
 makes
 them
 more


productive.
 It
 gives
 them
 an
 ability
 to


spend
 more
 time
 with
 clients
 to
 do
 more.


It
 scales
 our
 footprint,
 our
 reach.
 The


more
 interesting
 thing
 we're
 spending
 a


lot
 of
 time
 on,
 you
 might
 have
 seen
 last


week,
 Becky,
 that
 we
 put
 out
 a
 memo


where
 we
 announced
 what
 we're
 calling


one
 Goldman
 Sachs
 3.0,
 know
 the


evolution
 of
 our
 one
 Goldman
 Sachs


operating
 ethos
 is
 we're
 really
 looking


at
 six
 principles
 you
 know
 throughout


the
 firm
 to
 operate
 the
 firm
 more


efficiently
 serve
 clients
 better
 where


we're
 looking
 at
 processes
 inside
 the


firm
 and
 saying
 this
 technology
 gives
 us


the
 right
 and
 the
 ability
 for
 the
 first


time
 to
 reimagine
 these
 processes
 and


really
 do
 them
 entirely
 differently
 to


automate
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 to
 create


meaningful
 efficiency
 that
 then
 can
 be


reinvested
 in
 growth
 in
 the
 business.


It's
 not
 just,


>> you
 know,
 the
 exciting
 thing
 about
 what


he's
 saying
 right
 there
 is
 that
 Jamie


Diamond
 was
 making
 the
 same
 argument
 as


well.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 banks
 are
 seeing


that
 there
 are
 internal
 uh
 efficiencies


that
 they
 can
 operate
 in
 if
 they


effectively
 use
 AI.
 The
 question
 is
 how


quick
 can
 that
 lead
 to
 an
 ROI
 for
 the


overall
 bank
 itself.
 And
 you
 know
 the


earnings
 from
 these
 banks
 again
 outside


of
 a
 couple
 regional
 banks
 which
 by
 the


way
 Zions
 they
 had
 earnings
 yesterday.


Apparently
 last
 week
 we
 got
 like
 a


preliminary
 part
 of
 their
 earnings
 with


this
 charge
 off
 that
 they
 legally
 had
 to


report
 and
 that's
 what
 caused
 all
 the


concern
 about
 the
 regional
 banks
 having


a
 credit
 crisis.
 They
 reported
 earnings


yesterday.
 They
 demolished
 earnings.


They
 had
 56
 million
 in
 charge
 offs.
 50


million
 of
 that
 was
 the
 uh
 fraud
 charge


off
 that
 they
 had
 to
 legally
 report
 last


week
 which
 caused
 everyone
 to
 get
 scared


about
 the
 regional
 banks.
 they
 only
 had


an
 extra
 six
 million
 of
 charge
 offs
 of


like
 quoteunquote
 default
 default
 or
 or


bad
 loans.
 So
 their
 earnings
 were
 great


and
 and
 so
 were
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 regional


banks
 that
 reported
 last
 week.
 So
 every


single
 bank
 that
 has
 reported
 including


Goldman
 Sachs
 has
 beat
 definitively
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 line.
 And
 you


know
 I
 think
 it's
 maybe
 too
 early
 to
 say


if
 that's
 all
 because
 of
 AI
 but
 based
 on


what
 David
 Solomon
 is
 saying
 a
 lot
 of
 it


seems
 like
 it
 could
 turn
 into
 the


ecosystem
 of
 AI
 as
 he's
 mentioning


becoming
 more
 and
 more
 important.
 Um,


and
 if
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 that
 doesn't


stop,
 then
 we
 should
 be
 in
 for
 a
 little


bit
 more
 earnings
 growth
 over
 the
 next


coming
 years.
 And
 speaking
 of
 earnings


growth
 and,
 you
 know,
 AI
 efficiency,


this
 is
 what
 Amazon
 reported
 today,
 or


this
 is
 at least
 what
 the
 New
 York
 Times


reported
 today
 for
 Amazon.
 Amazon
 is


reportedly
 hoping
 its
 robots
 can
 replace


more
 than
 600,000
 jobs
 it
 would


otherwise
 have
 to
 hire
 in
 the
 United


States
 by
 2033.


So
 you
 know
 when
 you
 think
 of
 AI


transforming
 an
 enterprise
 for
 Goldman


Sachs
 it
 would
 be
 making
 the
 way
 they
 do


underwriting
 the
 way
 they
 do
 M&A
 IPOs


etc
 more
 efficient
 for
 Amazon
 it's


physical
 labor
 that
 they
 are
 trying
 to


automate
 away
 likely
 with
 humanoid


robots
 maybe
 they're
 going to
 buy
 it


from
 Tesla
 maybe
 they're
 going to
 buy
 it


from
 figure
 maybe
 they
 buy
 from
 maybe


they
 build
 it
 themselves
 but
 this
 is


happening
 this
 is
 going
 to
 happen


whether
 it's
 in
 5
 years
 or
 10
 years


there
 is
 just
 no
 way
 a
 business
 is
 going


to
 look
 at
 the
 potential
 of
 using
 AI
 in


the
 physical
 form


as
 a
 cheaper
 significantly
 cheaper


alternative
 to
 a
 human
 and
 not
 take
 that


opportunity.
 So
 the
 question
 is
 going
 to


be
 you
 know
 how
 does
 society
 prepare
 for


that
 but
 this
 is
 something
 that
 likely


is
 going
 to
 play
 out
 and
 whether
 it's


Goldman
 Sachs
 or
 Amazon
 all
 of
 these


guys
 are
 trying
 to
 see
 how
 AI
 can


transform
 the
 entire
 industry
 which


again
 brings
 up
 the
 the
 ethical
 question


of
 just
 like
 okay
 if
 we're
 going
 to


transform
 all
 these
 industries
 and


increase
 shareholder
 returns
 by


increasing
 profit
 margins
 what
 happens


to
 human
 beings
 that
 like
 need
 a
 job


which
 is
 all
 of
 us
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 an


answer
 to
 that
 question
 but
 it
 is


something
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 having
 to


Think
 about
 Warner
 Brothers
 is
 up
 10%


right
 now.
 Pre-market,
 I
 think
 they
 just


said
 something.
 WBD.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 that


go.
 That's
 up
 8%.
 Warner
 Brothers
 said


they
 are
 open
 to
 being
 acquired.
 Boom.


There
 you
 go.
 They
 are
 open
 to
 being


acquired.


That
 is
 enough
 for
 Warner
 Brothers
 to


get
 an
 8%
 move.
 What
 was
 the
 company?
 Uh


I
 think
 it
 was
 Paramount,
 right,
 that


was
 thinking
 of
 acquiring
 these
 guys.


Warner
 Brothers
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 debt.
 They


have
 like
 70
 billion
 in
 debt.
 So,
 I


mean,
 they
 would
 be
 acquiring
 a
 lot
 of


assets
 with
 HBO
 Max
 and
 all
 the


different
 things
 they
 own,
 but
 they
 also


have
 to
 deal
 with
 a
 ton
 of
 debt
 debt


that
 they
 have.
 Isn't
 Amazon
 already


using
 robots
 in
 some
 of
 their
 assembly


lines
 of
 sorting
 packages?
 Yes.
 Um,
 it's


just
 not
 necessarily
 humanoid
 robotics


that
 are
 like
 doing
 everything
 a
 normal


human
 would
 do.
 Amazon
 still
 employs


over
 two
 million
 people
 that
 literally


do
 the
 things
 that
 you
 need
 a
 human
 to


do.
 So,
 there
 I
 mean,
 Amazon's
 been


using
 robotics
 for
 the
 past
 15
 years.


question
 is,
 do
 they
 end
 up
 just


replacing
 the
 whole
 human?


And
 maybe
 that
 does
 happen
 sooner
 than


later.
 Yeah,
 PK,
 PSKY,
 that
 was
 the


company
 that
 uh
 the
 merger
 between


Paramount
 and
 Sky
 potentially
 acquiring


Warner
 Brothers.
 That
 would
 be
 a
 pretty


big
 consolidation
 in
 the
 industry.


That's
 Paramount
 Plus
 and
 HBO
 Max
 coming


together.
 I
 I
 actually
 do
 pay
 for
 HBO


Max
 even
 though
 I
 barely
 use
 it.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 I
 pay
 for
 it.
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 pay


for
 it
 because
 they
 have
 The
 Dark
 Knight


and
 Inception
 and
 on
 the
 random
 day
 I


feel
 like
 watching
 The
 Dark
 Knight
 or


Inception.
 Like
 I
 really
 should
 cancel


the
 subscription,
 bro.
 I
 don't
 pay
 for


it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 watch
 it,
 so
 I


don't
 know
 why
 I
 paid
 for
 it,
 but


yeah,
 if
 that
 were
 to
 merge
 with


Paramount,
 it
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible


to
 see.
 Did
 Kathy
 sell
 SoFi?
 Yes,
 Kathy


took
 some
 profits
 on
 SoFi
 yesterday.
 I


have
 not
 bought
 SoFi
 for
 those
 that
 are


asking.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 buy
 it
 yesterday


and
 then
 the
 thing
 ran
 up
 10%
 and
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 I
 can't
 buy
 this
 anymore."


But,
 um,
 we'll
 see
 going
 into
 earnings


if
 if
 I
 buy
 some
 shares
 or
 sell
 some


puts.
 But,
 she
 sold
 some
 Oaklo
 53,000


shares.
 She
 sold
 some
 Kratos.
 She
 sold


some
 Palanteer,
 sold
 some
 Shopify,
 sold


some
 Roblox,
 uh,
 and
 then
 sold
 some


Palanteer,
 Roblox,
 Shopify,
 and
 SoFi
 in


the
 Arc
 Fun.
 She
 actually
 bought
 CLA


instead,
 which
 I
 don't
 get,
 bro.
 Selling


SoFi
 to
 buy
 CLA.
 I
 really
 don't
 get


that.
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 weird,
 but


that's
 what
 she
 ended
 up
 doing.
 And
 she


took
 some
 profits
 there
 as
 well.


So,
 that's
 what
 she
 got
 with


Kathy
 and
 SoFi.
 Is
 Beyond
 Meat
 still


moving?
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 why
 it


squeezed
 yesterday.
 Wow,
 it's
 up
 another


63%.
 Dude,
 see
 the
 theme
 of
 yesterday


and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 talked
 about
 on
 the


market
 close
 is
 that
 I
 was
 really
 happy


that
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 basically
 0.5%
 away


from
 alltime
 highs
 which
 is
 super


bullish.
 Uh
 and
 the
 other
 reason
 that's


super
 bullish
 is
 because
 a
 lot
 of the


random
 frothy
 names
 like
 a
 QBTS
 in
 the


quantum
 space
 or
 a
 Oaklow
 were
 red


yesterday.
 I
 mean
 QBTS
 lost
 another
 8%.


It's
 down
 another
 2%
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


the
 stock
 is
 down
 over
 20%
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 and
 I
 was
 like
 that's
 good


because
 there
 was
 no
 reason
 for
 it
 to


run
 up
 to
 50.
 So
 like
 Oaklo
 down
 from


190
 good
 is
 there
 was
 no
 reason
 for
 it


to
 run
 up
 there.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


staying
 down
 Oaklo
 down
 another
 4%
 and


the
 S&P
 is
 going
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs


super
 bullish
 but
 then
 you
 have
 this


Beyond
 Meat
 stuff
 and
 I'm
 like
 well
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 explain
 now
 if


that's
 necessarily
 bullish.


I
 guess
 people
 decided
 they
 wanted
 to
 be


vegan.
 It
 is
 heavily
 shorted,
 so
 that


could
 be
 a
 headline
 as
 well.
 Is
 there
 a


Walmart
 partnership
 today?
 I
 mean,
 that


could
 definitely
 get
 the
 street
 excited.


Beyond
 Meat,
 Walmart.
 Wow,
 it
 came
 out
 a


minute
 ago.
 Wow.
 Two
 minutes
 ago,
 dude.


I
 clicked
 on
 it
 right
 when
 it
 ran
 up
 not


seeing
 this
 headline.
 Beyond
 Meat


expands
 distribution
 at
 Walmart.


Okay.
 Is
 that
 enough
 for
 it
 to
 go
 up
 70%


though?
 Like
 I
 mean


I
 I
 don't
 know
 dude.
 I
 I
 I
 guess
 I
 know


they
 are
 shorted
 but
 do
 people
 even
 eat


Beyond
 Meat
 anymore?
 Like
 this
 thing
 was


like
 a
 fad
 with
 the
 Impossible
 Burgers


and
 stuff.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know


how
 people
 are
 that
 excited
 about
 it.
 I


know
 this
 thing
 ran
 like
 crazy
 in
 2021,


but


I
 guess
 Walmart
 distribution
 is
 enough


to
 uh
 to
 get
 people
 Yeah.
 What
 does


expand
 even
 mean?
 They
 I'm
 sure
 they


were
 already
 in
 Walmarts.
 I
 guess


there's
 different
 Walmarts
 that
 they're


going
 to.


I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 This
 stuff
 is
 weird.


So,
 look,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 liked
 that


Oaklo
 and
 the
 Quantum
 stuff,
 all
 that


stuff
 was
 read
 yesterday.
 I
 And
 not


because
 I
 want
 to
 see
 people
 lose
 money


on
 those,
 but
 because
 even
 if
 you're


down
 on
 those
 names,
 if
 you
 got
 in


early,
 you
 are
 still
 up
 like
 crazy.
 And


you
 yourself
 should
 not
 want
 those


things
 to
 go
 straight
 to
 the
 moon
 if
 you


want
 any
 chance
 for
 those
 stocks
 to


actually
 stabilize
 in
 a
 range
 because


the
 quicker
 they
 go
 to
 the
 moon,
 the


quicker
 they
 come
 back
 down.
 So,
 you


should
 probably
 want
 a
 healthy


retracement,
 which
 I
 think
 Oaklow
 and


D-Wave
 both
 did
 take
 yesterday
 to


normalize
 potentially
 the
 the
 30s


instead
 of
 the
 50s.
 And,
 you
 know,


D-Wave
 would
 still
 be
 up
 thousands
 of


percent.
 But,
 it
 would
 be
 a
 clown
 market


if
 the
 S&P
 went
 back
 to
 673
 all-time


highs
 and
 then
 Oak
 goes
 back
 to
 200.


It's
 like,
 no,
 dude.
 Like,
 that
 that's


just
 too
 much
 liquidity.
 There's
 no
 real


rotation.
 There's
 no
 broadening
 of
 the


market.
 I
 know
 if
 Oakland
 goes
 to
 zero,


it
 doesn't
 matter,
 but
 you
 just
 don't


want
 to
 see
 all
 those
 names
 run
 up
 with


the
 market
 because
 they're
 not
 being


rewarded
 for
 anything.
 They're
 just


being
 rewarded
 for
 excess
 liquidity.


Now,
 AMD
 hitting
 all-time
 highs


yesterday,
 super
 bullish.
 Apple,
 based


on
 these
 iPhone
 17
 reports
 being
 way


better
 than
 the
 iPhone
 16,
 hitting


all-time
 highs
 yesterday,
 super
 bullish.


Apple
 still
 only
 up
 8%
 year
 to
 date.


These
 are
 things
 that
 are
 very,
 very


healthy
 from
 my
 perspective.
 And
 it
 was


really
 healthy
 to
 not
 see
 the
 oak
 lows


of
 the
 world
 go
 to
 200
 yesterday.
 And
 so


the
 question
 now
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 do
 they
 stay
 at
 those
 levels


or
 do
 they
 end
 up
 ramping
 back
 up?


Mishaka
 says,
 "I
 agree.
 I'm
 up
 400%
 on


QBTS,
 so
 I'm
 not
 greedy."
 Yeah.
 It's


like,
 and
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 Maybe
 you're
 not


up
 6x
 anymore,
 but
 you
 know,
 if
 the
 6x


results
 in
 being
 up
 1x
 and
 going
 back
 to


being
 up
 4x
 results
 in
 at least
 staying


up
 4x,
 you
 I
 think
 most
 people
 would


rather
 say
 I'
 I'd
 rather
 keep
 the
 gains


I
 have
 versus
 go
 up
 into
 the
 moon,
 miss


selling
 the
 top
 because
 everyone
 misses


selling
 the
 top
 and
 then
 have
 everything


come
 crashing
 down.


I
 feel
 like
 that
 is
 also
 more
 healthy


for
 the
 broader
 market
 as
 well.
 Gold
 is


coming
 down,
 folks.
 So,
 we
 we
 didn't


talk
 too
 much
 about
 this
 commodity
 trade


outside
 of
 when
 I
 mention
 mentioned
 it


in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 show.


If
 anyone
 has
 any
 theories
 on
 why
 you


think
 it's
 coming
 down,
 I
 would
 love
 to


see
 it
 in
 the
 chat.
 My
 theory
 is
 simply


the
 trade
 got
 overcrowded.


It
 got
 overcrowded.
 However,
 I
 say
 that


with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt
 because
 I
 mean,


what
 if
 this
 is
 something
 that
 can


reverse
 by
 tomorrow?
 Now,
 I
 know
 it's


not
 a
 stock
 price
 and
 there's
 not
 that


many
 like
 headlines
 that
 we
 can
 look
 at


that
 can
 easily
 can
 get
 this
 thing
 to


move
 up
 or
 down.
 Commodities
 are
 a


totally
 different
 animal.
 But
 I
 I I
 do


feel
 like
 the
 trade
 at
 some
 point
 after


an
 11-year
 breakout
 probably
 got
 a
 bit


overcrowded,
 at least
 for
 now.
 And
 maybe


because
 of
 that
 overcrowding,
 you're


seeing
 some
 weakness.
 I
 mean,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 headline
 right
 here.


India's
 biggest
 refinery
 yesterday,
 ran


out
 of
 silver
 for
 the
 first
 time
 as


demand
 exploded.
 Now,
 Diwali
 was


probably
 a
 part
 of
 this
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 the


lot
 of
 the
 elements
 in
 silver
 and
 gold


are
 used
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 different


things
 that
 are
 made
 for
 Dvali.
 But
 the


fact
 that
 there's
 this
 much
 demand


across
 the
 world
 for
 global
 silver
 and


the
 global
 silver
 supply
 has
 lagged


behind
 demand
 for
 five
 straight
 years


now
 that
 it's
 starting
 to
 flip.
 It's


quite
 incredible
 to
 see
 how
 much


excitement
 there
 is
 in
 this
 trade


and
 the
 question
 is
 will
 that
 excitement


continue
 to
 last?
 Daniel
 says
 taking
 a


breather
 moves
 have
 been
 too
 big.
 Um


Vanango
 says
 overextended.
 Kel
 says


everything
 is
 down
 right
 now
 on
 that.


Green
 Bull's
 goal
 will
 be
 15K
 in
 two


years.
 We
 looked
 at
 the
 central
 bank


chart
 yesterday
 that
 showed
 so
 many


central
 banks
 are
 starting
 to
 buy


massive,
 massive
 amounts
 of
 gold.
 Even


Poland,
 Kazakhstan,
 Turkey,
 they're
 all


buying
 as
 much
 gold
 as
 you
 can
 imagine.


And
 so,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those


things
 that's
 becoming
 an
 asset
 class


that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 central
 banks
 are


liking
 probably
 even
 more
 than


treasuries.
 Speaking
 of
 treasuries,
 the


US
 10-year
 pre-markets,
 wow,
 3.95.
 We


closed
 below
 four
 yesterday.
 we
 open


below
 four
 once
 again
 today.


You
 know,
 it
 it
 it
 really
 doesn't
 make


sense
 for
 gold
 to
 be
 going
 higher
 and


for
 the
 10-year
 to
 be
 going
 lower.
 But


if
 gold
 starts
 going
 lower,
 maybe
 that


starts
 to
 make
 more
 sense
 in
 terms
 of


how
 these
 two
 macro
 dynamics
 should
 be


playing
 out.
 Gold
 is
 becoming
 very


liquid
 and
 maybe
 all
 that
 liquidity
 is


also
 a
 reason
 why,
 you
 know,
 some
 people


might
 be
 taking
 advantage
 of
 it
 as
 well.


So,
 you
 got
 the
 10-year
 potentially


coming
 down.
 Countries
 are
 fomoing
 into


gold.
 That
 could
 also
 be
 happening.


countries
 could
 be
 fomoing
 into
 it
 even


more
 than


uh
 even
 more
 than
 individual
 investors.


We
 looked
 at
 this
 when
 the
 market
 close


yesterday.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 The
 term


AI
 bubble
 on
 Google
 Trends
 has
 five
 to


8x
 the
 search
 volume
 of
 the
 following


terms.
 How
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin,
 Bitcoin,


Ethereum,
 how
 to
 buy
 Nvidia,
 stock


market,
 how
 to
 buy
 stocks.
 This
 was


fascinating
 to
 look
 at
 yesterday
 because


more
 people
 are
 searching
 for
 if
 we're


in
 an
 AI
 bubble
 than
 what
 you
 would


expect
 people
 to
 be
 searching
 for
 if
 we


were
 at
 the
 top
 of
 that
 bubble.
 People


would
 be
 searching
 for
 how
 to
 buy


stocks,
 how
 to
 buy
 Nvidia,
 Bitcoin,


Ethereum,
 like
 stock
 market.
 Like
 these


are
 the
 terms
 that
 would
 be
 trending.


And
 in
 fact,
 it's
 AI
 bubble.
 So
 to
 me,
 I


think
 this
 is
 actually
 not
 toppy.
 I


think
 this
 is
 more
 so
 a
 signal
 of
 we've


got
 a
 lot
 of
 room
 to
 grow
 if
 the


majority
 of
 people
 are
 concerned
 with
 be


about
 being
 in
 a
 bubble
 versus
 being


concerned
 about,
 you
 know,
 the
 things


that
 you
 would
 search
 for
 in
 a
 bubble,


like
 how
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean,
 the


fact
 that
 Bitcoin
 is
 not
 even
 near
 its


2017
 levels
 in
 terms
 of
 search
 volume


just
 goes
 to
 show
 retail's
 just
 not


interested
 right
 now.
 And
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 can
 easily
 have
 a
 bubble
 if


retail
 is
 not
 massively
 interested
 in


the
 context
 of
 of
 crypto.
 Here's
 another


stat
 that
 was
 important
 yesterday.


Goldman
 Sachs
 says
 its
 basket
 of
 most


shorted
 stocks
 is
 up
 16%
 in
 October,
 on


pace
 for
 its
 best
 month
 record
 since


2008,
 far
 outpacing
 the
 S&P
 500.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 Goldman's
 unprofitable
 tech


basket,
 which
 includes
 names
 like
 Roku


and
 Pelaton,
 has
 also
 surged
 16%,
 the


strongest
 since
 October
 2014.
 So,
 this


is
 kind
 of
 why
 you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 the


names
 like
 a
 Beyond
 Me
 get
 these
 massive


moves.
 You
 do
 have
 shorted
 names
 that


are
 on
 a
 percentage
 basis
 much
 more


shorted
 than
 you
 know
 your
 average
 tech


stock
 have
 a
 pretty
 strong
 October
 which


also
 aids
 to
 the
 volatility
 that
 we've


seen
 in
 October.
 October
 is
 the
 most


volatile
 month
 on
 record
 and
 the
 fact


that
 some
 of
 these
 shorted
 names
 are


getting
 the
 moves
 that
 they're
 getting


continues
 to
 prove
 how
 volatile
 this


month
 ultimately
 is
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 levels.


Yeah,
 profits
 are
 coming
 from
 somewhere


else.
 100%
 profits
 are
 coming
 from
 so


many
 different
 I
 from
 so
 many
 different


areas


as
 well
 which
 is
 a
 whole
 different
 way


that
 this
 is
 playing
 out.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 in
 the
 context
 of


some
 of
 this
 macro
 news
 and
 what
 is


going
 on
 as
 we
 get
 to
 the
 end
 uh
 of


October.
 Here
 is
 Karpathy,
 one
 of
 the


former
 guys
 at
 Tesla,
 talking
 a
 little


bit
 more
 about
 some
 of
 the
 AI
 progress


we're
 seeing
 right
 now.
 Overall,
 the


models
 are
 are
 um
 they're
 not
 there.
 And


I
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 the
 industry
 it's


it's
 um
 it's
 over
 it's
 it's
 making
 too


big
 of
 a
 jump
 and
 it's
 trying
 to
 pretend


like
 this
 is
 amazing
 and
 it's
 not.
 It's


slop
 and
 I
 think
 they're
 not
 coming
 to


terms
 with
 it.
 Overall,
 the
 models
 are


are
 um
 they're
 not
 there
 and
 I
 kind
 of


feel
 like
 the


>> So,
 you
 got
 Carpathy
 basically
 saying,


"Hey,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 stupid."
 And


I
 was
 talking
 about
 this
 yesterday.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 starting
 to
 agree
 with
 him
 as


well.
 Like
 I
 downloaded
 Sora,
 I
 used
 it


a
 little
 bit
 and
 I'm
 like
 I
 am
 never


gonna
 use
 this
 again,
 bro.
 I
 don't
 want


to
 see
 this
 random
 AI
 generated
 content.


Like
 it
 really
 is
 stupid.
 And
 so
 when


Karpathy
 who
 you
 know
 used
 to
 work
 on


FSD
 he
 was
 one
 of the
 head
 guys
 on
 FSD


and
 is
 you
 know
 using
 AI
 to
 like
 really


make
 a
 change
 in
 the
 world
 is
 seeing


that
 these


models
 that
 are
 producing
 the
 type
 of


content
 they're
 producing
 that
 are
 using


all
 this
 GPU
 data
 center
 uh
 capacity
 for


what
 exactly
 to
 like
 make
 a
 picture
 of
 a


cat
 jumping
 over
 a
 birthday
 cake.
 Like


it
 it's
 just
 it's
 weird.
 And
 so
 maybe


I'm
 not
 the
 target
 market,
 maybe
 I'm
 not


the
 dem
 demographic,
 but
 I
 wonder
 how


many
 people
 in
 the
 world
 actually
 want


to
 sit
 and
 consume
 all
 that
 content
 and


if
 that's
 the
 real
 resources
 that
 people


should
 be
 focusing
 on
 when
 it
 comes
 to


AI


and
 you
 know
 maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


what
 people
 care
 about.
 Speaking
 of


brain
 brought
 content,
 I
 made
 this
 post


yesterday
 that
 resonated
 with
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 I
 wonder
 how
 much
 it
 resonates


with
 everybody
 here,
 but
 I
 said
 I
 wish


Instagram
 reels
 ran
 on
 AWS
 because
 maybe


maybe
 just
 for
 one
 day
 I
 wouldn't
 get


sent
 all
 the
 stupid
 reels
 that
 I
 have
 to


pretend
 to
 click
 on
 in
 these
 group
 chats


and
 then
 respond
 to
 them
 every
 day.


Because
 at
 this
 point
 in
 my
 life,
 as


someone
 who's
 about
 to
 turn
 28,
 I've


just
 told
 people
 that
 if
 you
 send
 me
 a


reel,
 I
 will
 not
 watch
 it.
 I
 have
 zero


sympathy
 for
 not
 watching
 it.
 I
 will


actively
 tell
 you
 after
 you
 send
 me
 the


reel
 that
 I'm
 not
 clicking
 on
 it
 in


hopes
 of
 you
 one
 day
 deciding
 to
 never


send
 me
 a
 reel
 again.


Ironically,
 it
 just
 makes
 my
 friends


want
 to
 spam
 me
 with
 more
 reels.
 So,
 I


I'm
 putting
 my
 foot
 down
 in
 a
 lot
 of


these
 group
 chats,
 bro.
 I'm
 really


putting
 my
 foot
 down
 and
 I'm
 just


telling
 them,
 dude,
 I'm
 not
 clicking
 on


this.
 I
 don't
 care
 if
 it's
 10
 seconds.
 I


don't
 have
 the
 patience
 to
 listen
 to


this
 for
 to
 to
 to
 watch
 whatever
 thing


that
 gave
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 giggle


during
 the
 middle
 of
 your
 day
 for
 10


seconds.
 I'm
 not
 watching
 it.
 I'm
 just


not.
 And
 if
 it's
 more
 than
 10
 seconds,
 I


mean,
 you're
 out
 of
 your
 mind,
 dude.
 I'm


not
 waiting
 through
 30
 seconds
 of


watching
 some
 stupid
 reel.
 So,
 I'm
 done.


I'm
 totally
 done.
 I
 I
 am
 moving
 on
 with


my
 life
 and
 I'm
 telling
 people
 I'm
 not


watching
 it.
 Having
 said
 that,
 I
 made
 a


new
 Instagram.
 So,
 follow
 me
 on


Instagram.


So,
 I'm
 on
 Instagram.
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I


was
 going
 to
 start
 one
 anyway.
 I
 feel


like
 I
 should
 probably
 like
 start


posting
 on
 this
 platform
 and
 like
 build


up
 Instagram.
 So,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 follow


me
 there,
 you
 can
 follow
 me
 there.
 I


don't
 there's
 no
 guarantee
 I'm
 even
 ever


going
 to
 be
 posting
 on
 this.
 I
 just
 feel


like
 I
 probably
 should
 be
 posting
 on


Instagram
 because
 it's
 been
 like
 10


years
 and
 I
 haven't
 actually
 made
 an


Instagram.
 So,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 follow
 me


there,
 I
 will
 not
 send
 you
 reels.
 I
 will


also
 not
 click
 on
 your
 reels
 if
 you
 send


it
 to
 me.
 But,
 uh
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 use


this
 as
 a
 way
 to
 show
 more
 of
 a
 behind


the
 scenes
 of
 my
 actual
 life.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 actually
 will
 do


that.
 Maybe
 in
 2026,
 but
 there
 it
 is.


Instagram's
 out.
 So,
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to


follow
 me,


you
 can
 uh
 you
 can
 follow
 me
 there.
 It


looks
 like
 a
 fake
 account,
 dude.
 It


looks
 like
 such
 a
 fake
 it.
 Emit
 Cook


Rage
 at
 222.
 It
 looks
 so
 stupid.
 It


looks
 like
 a
 fake
 account,
 but
 every


other
 username
 was
 taken.
 So,
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 put
 my


first
 and
 last
 name
 with
 those
 numbers


there."
 And
 that's
 You
 just
 want
 us
 to


watch
 your
 reels.
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 I'm


ever
 going
 to
 make
 I
 I
 really
 I
 I
 want


to
 capture
 some
 moments
 in
 life,
 right?


Because,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 I
 was
 actually


scroll,
 you
 know,
 here.
 Okay,
 I'll
 I'll


I'll
 talk
 more
 about
 this
 later,
 but
 I


was
 scrolling
 through
 Facebook
 the
 other


day
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 dude,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 memories
 on
 Facebook,
 but
 I
 don't
 use


Facebook
 anymore.
 I
 still
 scroll
 through


Instagram,
 you
 know,
 occasionally
 for
 a


couple
 minutes
 a
 day.
 I
 was
 like,
 it'd


be
 nice
 to
 just
 capture
 some
 memories
 on


a
 platform
 that
 I
 can
 go
 back
 to.


Realistically,
 I'm
 like,
 you
 know,
 I


should
 be
 documenting
 the
 journey
 of


life
 on
 a
 platform
 that
 I
 actually
 use.


Cuz
 on
 Facebook,
 I'm
 like
 trying
 to
 find


these
 memories
 from
 like
 10
 years
 ago.


I'm
 like,
 "Dude,
 I
 don't even
 use


Facebook
 anymore.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to


use
 this."
 So,
 I
 feel
 like
 from
 that


perspective,
 it's
 not
 the
 worst
 idea
 to


uh
 to
 start
 posting
 on
 IG.
 All
 right,


here
 we
 go,
 folks.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 It
 is
 Tuesday,
 October


21st,
 9:30
 a.m.,
 and
 the
 snack
 market


is
 once
 again
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 see


if
 we
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 this
 green
 momentum


that
 we
 had
 yesterday.
 S&P
 500
 flat
 on


the
 day.
 Looks
 like
 it's
 about
 to
 go


red.
 We
 do
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle


right
 there.
 67134.
 We
 did
 close
 above


671
 yesterday.
 Tesla
 goes
 red.
 Palanteer


slightly
 red.
 Robin
 Hood
 down
 1%.
 It
 did


hit
 137
 yesterday.
 Grab
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Google
 down
 1%,
 SoFi
 down
 half


a
 percent,
 2850
 from
 28.90
 to
 2850.
 AMD


down
 half
 a
 percent
 as
 well.
 Reddit's
 up


1.4%.
 Amazon
 somehow
 Amazon
 is
 holding


on
 to
 a
 1%
 move.
 Amazon
 literally
 did


not
 go
 red
 at
 all
 yesterday
 outside
 of


the
 pre-markets
 and
 then
 it
 bounced
 up


green
 even
 after
 the
 AWS
 outage
 which


literally
 affected
 half
 the
 internet.


But
 Amazon
 holding
 Dawn.
 And
 I
 put
 the


green
 or
 red
 poll
 in
 the
 chat
 so
 you
 can


uh
 vote
 on
 what
 you
 think
 we
 end
 up
 for


the
 day.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 trying
 to
 go


for
 219.
 Meta
 that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.


Salesforce
 up
 1%.
 ELF
 is
 up
 1.23%.
 How


about
 Galaxy
 which
 crushed
 earnings?


These
 guys
 are
 up
 7%.
 They
 were
 up
 12%.


So
 they're
 losing
 some
 of
 their
 steam.


Coca-Cola
 was
 up
 3%.
 Coca-Cola
 holding


on
 to
 that
 3%.
 GM
 was
 up
 11%.
 GM
 right


there
 is
 up
 8%.
 So
 giving
 back
 a
 little


bit
 of
 those
 gains.
 SMCI,
 there
 was
 the


rumor
 yesterday
 that
 they're
 partnering


with
 XAI.
 We
 have
 no
 updates
 on
 if
 that


rumor
 is
 true,
 but
 that
 was
 the
 rumor


that
 got
 this
 thing
 to
 pop
 up
 7%


yesterday.
 Bitcoin
 108
 loses
 109.


Ethereum
 3,800.
 That
 means
 Bitmine's


probably
 at
 52.
 Bit
 mine
 5254


that's
 down
 2.3%.
 The
 NASDAQ's
 down.


Crowd
 strikes
 down.
 Coinbase
 is
 down.


HIMS


87
 cents
 away
 from
 losing
 50.
 Micro


Strategy
 that's
 down
 1%.
 PaloAlto
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 And
 then
 ESTs
 losing
 a
 100


from
 last
 week,
 losing
 85
 from


yesterday,
 now
 at
 81.
 still
 up
 a
 chunk


from
 65,


but
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh,
 Square,
 that's


down.
 Intel
 was
 up
 4%,
 that's
 down.


Archer
 was
 up
 yesterday,
 that's
 down


another
 2%.
 TFC's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Palanteer
 goes
 down.
 Robin
 Hood
 loses


134
 now
 back
 below
 134.
 SoFi
 slightly


goes
 green
 by
 about
 a
 cent
 trying
 to


hold
 on,
 but
 still
 red.
 Tesla
 right
 here


at
 446.
 That
 that
 one
 is
 basically
 flat


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Now,
 Apple
 hit
 264


yesterday.
 Hit
 all-time
 highs.
 And
 I


think
 the
 iPhone
 17
 growth
 likely
 means


they
 deserve
 it.
 But
 262
 right
 here


trying
 to
 hold
 on
 at
 least
 to
 the
 260s.


Where
 are
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners?
 IN.
 Wow.


56.
 I
 ran
 losing
 that
 58
 level
 that
 it


held
 on
 to
 yesterday.


5695


on
 Iran.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 Bitcoin
 miners.


Where's
 Bit
 Farms?
 Oh
 my.
 Bit
 farms


actually
 took
 the
 biggest
 beating
 I


think
 over
 the
 last
 week.
 Bit
 farms
 was


at,
 let
 me
 do
 the
 math
 right
 now.
 Bit


Farms
 is
 down


30%.


30%.
 In
 the
 past
 week,
 I
 know
 they
 did


an
 offering
 and
 for
 a
 day
 it
 seemed
 like


the
 offering
 didn't
 matter,
 but
 then
 the


next
 day
 the
 offering
 kind
 of
 hit
 them.


Wol's
 down
 2%.
 Hives
 down
 2%.
 Clean


Spark
 down
 1%.
 Cipher
 down
 3%.
 IN
 down


3%,
 Riot
 down
 one,
 Galaxy
 is
 the
 only


one
 that's
 up
 because
 they
 had
 a
 good


earnings
 which
 is
 helping
 them.
 Wow.


Amazon
 220.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Look
 at
 that.


In
 the
 face
 of
 the
 AWS
 outage,
 Amazon
 is


the
 one
 that
 holds
 on
 and
 continues
 to


go
 green,
 which
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 to


see.
 So,
 Amazon
 holding
 on,
 the
 rest
 of


these
 companies
 going
 down.
 How
 about


the
 rare
 earth
 companies?
 They
 are
 all


down
 on
 the
 day.
 LAC
 down
 two,
 TMQ
 down


five,
 MP
 down
 three,
 CRML
 down
 nine,
 US


down
 nine.
 It
 looks
 like
 whatever


momentum
 the
 rare
 earth
 companies
 had


starting
 from
 three
 weeks
 ago,
 at least


over
 the
 past
 four
 days,
 has
 died
 down.


And
 maybe
 this
 is
 not
 a
 structural
 die


down
 of
 the
 momentum.
 Maybe
 it's
 them


taking
 a
 breather.
 Same
 thing
 with


silver.
 Maybe
 silver
 is
 just
 taking
 a


breather.
 Maybe
 it's
 not
 structural.


But
 if
 it's
 structural,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to


regain
 that
 momentum.
 It
 really
 isn't,


especially
 if
 momentum
 was
 the
 only


reason
 that
 they
 were
 running
 in
 the


first
 place.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 this
 one


ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 What
 about
 Oracle,


which
 got
 whacked
 yesterday?
 Oracle
 down


another
 1%.
 Does
 anyone
 have
 the


headline
 for
 why
 Oracle
 got
 hit


yesterday?
 I
 could
 not
 find
 why
 Oracle


was
 down
 5%.


I
 I I
 did
 not
 see
 a
 legitimate
 reason


for
 what
 was
 happening.
 Nebius,
 I
 did


sell
 a
 put
 on
 Nebius
 at
 98.


Maybe
 I
 get
 assigned.
 Who
 knows?
 It's
 at


105,
 140
 to
 105.


Um
 it
 has
 taken
 a
 pretty
 big
 beating


from
 those
 all-time
 highs.
 Uh
 but
 I
 did


sell
 a
 put
 for
 98.
 So
 if
 it
 gets
 below


98,
 I
 probably


will
 get
 that
 assignment.
 Beyond
 meat,


what
 do
 we
 have
 there?
 That's
 up
 61%


based
 on
 the
 announcement
 with
 Walmart,


which
 I
 don't
 know if
 is
 enough
 to


warrant
 a
 60%
 move,
 but
 that's
 up.
 GSIT,


uh,
 this
 was
 the
 company
 that
 put
 out
 a


white
 paper
 yesterday.
 They're
 up


another
 30%.
 They
 were
 up
 200%


yesterday,
 and
 this
 white
 paper
 had
 to


do
 with
 GPUs
 that
 don't
 have
 to
 use


energy
 as
 intensively
 as
 Nvidia's
 GPUs


do.
 Um,
 no
 revenue,
 no
 earnings,
 no


distribution
 deals,
 just
 a
 white
 paper.


And
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 continues
 to


go
 green.
 Uh,
 Rathon,
 that's
 up
 as
 well.


Again,
 they
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.


Rathon.
 Wow.
 9%
 for
 Rathon.
 I
 didn't


look
 exact.
 I
 mean,
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom,
 but
 I
 guess
 they
 said


something
 in
 the
 call
 or
 via
 guidance


that
 really
 is
 getting
 the
 street


excited.
 Defense
 contractors
 don't
 move


9%
 that
 easily.
 So,
 you
 would
 imagine


Loheed
 Martin
 probably
 will
 have
 a


strong
 earnings.
 That
 one's
 down
 2%


right
 now
 on
 the
 day.
 Why
 is
 Nebius


being
 hit
 so
 hard?
 You
 know,
 Nebius
 is


is
 is
 uh
 because
 I
 I
 bet
 you.
 All right.


So,
 Nebius
 is
 down
 3%.
 I
 bet
 you
 Cororee


is
 down
 at
 least
 2%.
 Cororeweave
 down


3.5%.
 Nebius,
 Cororeweave,
 Irene,
 all


these
 companies,
 if
 you're
 investing
 in


them,
 you've
 got
 to
 remember
 they're
 in


the
 same
 bucket
 from
 a
 narrative


perspective,
 just
 like
 Robin
 Hood,


Coinbase,
 etc.
 are
 in
 the
 same
 bucket


from
 a
 crypto
 perspective.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


I
 don't
 know if
 there's
 any
 justified


reason
 for
 why
 Neb
 is
 getting
 hit,


especially
 after
 Roman
 announced
 a
 new


data
 center
 that
 they
 were
 building


yesterday
 in
 Israel.
 But,
 it's
 down
 2%.


And
 it's
 down,
 you
 know,
 15%
 over
 the


past
 week.
 I
 think
 because
 all
 the
 data


center
 players
 are
 taking
 a
 hit.
 Same


thing
 with
 Core
 Wee.
 Cor
 we've
 announced


multiple
 partnerships
 over
 the
 past


week,
 not
 to
 mention
 the
 14
 billion


partnership
 with
 Meta.
 Does
 that
 deserve


to
 go
 down
 from
 150
 to
 120?
 I
 don't


know.
 But
 all
 the
 data
 centers
 get
 hit


at
 the
 same
 time
 if
 they
 do
 get
 hit.
 If


you
 are
 in
 this
 trade,
 you
 are
 in
 the


trade
 with
 all
 the
 other
 stocks
 as
 well.


That
 doesn't
 mean
 they're
 going
 to


proportionally
 trade
 onetoone
 every


single
 day
 uh
 together,
 but
 you're


likely
 in
 the
 same
 trade
 together
 in


regards
 to
 how
 the
 how
 the
 bucket
 of


stocks
 perform.
 I
 think
 the
 only
 kind
 of


way
 you
 get
 out
 of
 that
 bucket
 is
 if
 you


buy
 one
 of
 the
 hyperscalers
 because
 they


have
 different
 deals
 like
 not
 exactly
 a


hyperscaler
 but
 one
 of the
 larger


companies
 right
 and
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 and


Oracle
 they
 kind
 of
 trade
 on
 their
 own


merits
 because
 they're
 multiundred


billion
 dollar
 if
 not
 multi-
 trillion


dollar
 companies


but
 Nebus
 is
 a
 $30
 billion
 company
 you


know
 is
 a
 $60
 billion
 company
 IN's
 a
 $20


billion
 so
 all
 these
 names
 they
 are
 much


more
 volatile
 and
 probably
 in
 buckets


with
 these
 algos


that
 end
 up
 getting
 traded
 together
 SMCI


goes
 green.
 Okay,
 SMCI
 is
 up.
 TLT
 is


also
 up.
 TLT,
 look,
 if
 people
 hedged


with
 TLT,
 you
 are
 doing
 pretty
 decent
 on


it.
 I
 think
 TLT
 a
 couple
 months
 ago
 was


back
 at
 83.
 It's
 at
 92
 as
 the
 10ear


comes
 down.
 So,
 for
 those
 that
 bought


TLT
 as
 their
 hedge,
 look
 at
 that.
 The


10ear
 3.955.
 Lowest
 since
 April,
 folks.


Lowest
 since
 April.


And
 that's
 why
 you
 are
 getting
 some


momentum.
 Why
 is
 Oaklo
 tanking?
 I
 don't


know.
 But
 it
 is
 good
 to
 see.
 Look
 at


that.
 7%
 down,
 baby.


I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 super
 excited
 for


that,
 but
 I'm
 super
 excited
 for
 that.


You
 need
 the
 froth
 to
 leave
 the
 market.


You
 need
 it.
 We
 cannot
 have
 a
 healthy


bull
 market
 with
 stupid
 stocks
 running


up.
 D-wave
 down
 another
 4%,
 baby.


You
 need
 the
 froth
 to
 leave.
 We
 cannot


have
 nonsense
 companies
 running
 for
 no


reason.
 That's
 not
 indicative
 of
 any


level
 of
 longevity
 in
 regards
 to
 this


bull
 run.
 We
 just
 it's
 just
 not


possible.
 Every
 time
 that's
 happened,
 we


end
 up
 topping
 out.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 this


is
 really
 bullish
 to
 see
 the
 S&P
 two


bucks
 away
 from
 alltime
 highs
 and
 Oaklo


40
 bucks
 away
 from
 its
 all-time
 highs.


Potentially
 never
 even
 getting
 back
 to


those
 all-time
 highs
 because
 why
 the


hell
 should
 it?
 Someone
 tell
 me
 why
 it


deserves
 to
 be
 worth
 $40
 billion.


I
 mean
 like
 and
 if
 if
 there
 is
 no
 reason


then
 it
 shouldn't
 get
 back
 there
 and


that's
 a
 good
 thing.


That
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 to
 see.
 That's


important.
 Wow.
 Netflix
 is
 reportedly


one
 of
 the
 companies
 looking
 to
 acquire


Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery.
 Huh.
 Warner


Brothers
 up
 10%.
 Market
 cap
 is
 50


billion.
 Dude,
 if
 Netflix
 bought
 Warner


Brothers,


I
 wouldn't
 be
 that
 upset
 about
 that.
 How


much
 cash
 does
 Netflix
 have?
 How
 much


cash
 does
 Netflix
 have?


Uh,
 okay.
 Okay,
 Netflix
 has
 8
 billion
 in


cash.
 Warner
 Brothers
 is
 worth
 50


billion
 as
 of
 its
 move
 today.
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 how
 they
 would
 finance


this,
 but
 they
 would
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 good


content.
 Friends
 would
 come
 back
 to


Netflix.


I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 bullish.
 All
 those


films
 on
 HBO
 Max,
 Silicon
 Valley,
 these


shows,
 like
 these
 are
 really
 good
 pieces


of
 content.
 Are
 they
 worth
 50
 billion?


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 Netflix
 also
 now
 has


advertising.
 So,
 you
 know,
 worst
 case


scenario,
 they
 can
 they
 can
 put
 a
 ton
 of


ads
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 shows
 that
 they


know
 people
 will
 watch
 even
 if
 they


don't
 gain
 new
 subscribers.
 I
 mean,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 this


plays
 out.
 Comcast
 is
 another
 one
 to
 bid


for
 for
 Warner
 Brothers.
 That
 makes
 more


sense
 to
 me
 because
 Comcast
 and
 Warner


Brothers
 have
 had
 a
 pretty
 close


relationship
 over
 the
 past
 20
 years.


Netflix
 would
 be
 the
 outsider,


but
 I
 wouldn't
 hate
 that.
 You're
 buying


the
 IP
 essentially.
 Yeah,
 you're
 buying


the
 IP.
 They
 would
 get
 DC
 Studios.
 Yeah,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 assets
 that
 HBO
 Max


has.


a
 lot
 of
 stuff.


And


I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 the
 stuff


they
 own.


Yeah,
 TNT.
 That'd
 be
 massive.
 Wouldn't


they
 get
 basketball?
 Doesn't
 TNT
 still


have
 a
 contract
 with
 with
 the
 NBA?
 I


think


like
 they
 might
 get
 Live
 Sports,
 Cartoon


Network,
 Animal
 Planet,
 uh
 Food
 Network,


The
 Science
 Channel,
 CNN.


Um,
 which
 you
 know,
 even
 if
 everyone


doesn't
 watch
 CNN,
 there's
 a
 certain


part
 of
 the
 population
 that
 does
 care


about
 that
 type
 of
 news.
 You're
 going to


get
 those
 subscribers.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a


decent
 amount
 of
 stuff
 that
 they
 own.


Comedy
 Central,
 Crunchyroll,


there's
 a
 ton
 of
 things
 that
 Warner


Brothers
 owns
 that
 Netflix
 could
 get


from
 an
 asset
 class.
 Batman,
 yep,
 that's


a
 big
 one.


TNT
 contract
 is
 over.
 Okay,
 so
 they


won't
 get
 the
 NBA,
 but
 there
 are
 some


pretty
 good
 assets
 here.
 Hims
 down


1.25%.
 AS
 down
 1.8.
 85.
 Micro
 strategy


down
 1%
 on
 the
 day.
 Where
 is
 Regetti?


Regetti.
 Wow.
 3%
 down
 on
 Regetti.
 How


about
 NQ?
 O
 NQ
 down
 2%.
 INQ's
 been
 the


most
 resilient
 in
 all
 the
 quantum
 names.


Regetti
 and
 Dwave
 have
 just
 fallen
 off


like
 a
 rock.


Uh
 but
 Q
 has
 actually
 held
 up


strong
 compared
 to
 them.
 But
 you
 are


seeing
 those
 names
 just
 get
 hit.
 And


then
 an
 Oaklo
 right
 here
 down
 7%
 on
 the


day.
 SMR
 down
 7%.
 And
 then
 Nanuclear


down
 5%.


Galaxy
 is
 not
 fading
 because
 their


earnings
 are
 pretty
 good.
 Uh
 but
 all


their
 competitors
 are
 massively
 red


today.
 Wow.
 I
 ran
 6%
 down


70
 to
 55.


Cipher
 down
 four.
 Clean
 Spark
 down
 four.


Clean
 Spark
 was
 up
 20%
 yesterday.


Marathon
 down
 one.
 Bit
 farms
 just
 keeps


going
 to
 the
 gutter
 462.
 And
 then
 Riot


down
 1%.
 Again,
 all
 of
 these
 names
 are


still
 up
 multiple
 hundreds
 of
 percent


over
 the
 past
 year.
 Iran,
 Clean,
 Spark,


Cipher,
 etc.
 So,
 it's
 it
 it's
 I
 mean,


yeah,
 they're
 taking
 a
 breather.
 They


should
 be
 taking
 a
 breather.
 And
 also,


they
 should
 have
 to
 put
 up
 they
 should


be
 forced
 to
 do
 what
 Galaxy
 did,
 aka
 put


up
 massive
 earnings
 for
 them
 to
 get
 a


premium.
 All
 these
 companies,
 including


the
 Oakloss
 and
 the
 Quantum,
 like
 that's


the
 other
 thing,
 like
 D-Wave
 should
 put


up
 some
 really
 good
 earnings
 to
 get
 its


premium.
 D-Wave
 now
 down
 7%.


They
 don't
 put
 up
 good
 earnings.
 There's


there's
 no
 real
 growth.
 So
 like
 why
 is


it
 like
 Big
 Bear
 AI?
 They
 should
 be


forced
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI.
 If
 you're
 going


to
 put
 the
 ticker
 symbol
 AI
 in
 your
 in


your
 ticker
 or
 the
 letters
 in
 your


ticker,
 you
 should
 be
 forced
 to
 put
 up


good
 earnings.
 These
 companies
 have
 gone


parabolic
 and
 they
 haven't
 put
 up


anything
 other
 than
 a
 narrative.


It's
 like
 this
 is
 I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 so


healthy,
 bro.
 This
 is
 so
 healthy.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 I'm
 not
 being
 biased
 to
 any
 of


these
 companies
 because
 I
 say
 the
 exact


same
 thing
 with
 Robin
 Hood.
 Robin
 Hood


should
 be
 forced
 to
 show
 that
 Q3
 was


phenomenal
 to
 get
 back
 to
 150.
 They


shouldn't
 just
 get
 to
 150
 off
 hopes
 and


dreams.


Like
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff
 needs
 to
 be


earned
 and
 you
 know
 the
 best
 companies


that
 deserve
 it
 will
 earn
 it.
 But
 the


ones
 that
 don't,
 they
 should
 not
 be


running
 up
 for
 no
 reason.
 Nvidia
 right


there
 18141.
 That
 also
 goes
 red.
 Grab


right
 there
 561.
 Grabb's
 going to
 have


to
 put
 up
 good
 earnings
 to
 get
 back
 into


the
 sixes.
 Although
 I
 do
 think
 Grab
 is


getting
 manipulated.
 I
 mean,
 it
 stayed


at
 six
 for
 a
 month
 and
 now
 it's
 back


down
 below
 six
 for
 no
 reason.
 So,
 to
 me,


I
 think
 the
 shorts
 are
 more
 in
 control


there.
 But,
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 put


up
 good
 earnings
 to
 justify
 that
 they


deserve
 to
 be
 there.
 Apple
 right
 there,


that
 one
 is
 green,
 up
 8.1%
 on
 the
 day.


It
 shows
 a
 rotation
 out
 of
 risk.


Exactly.
 It
 shows
 a
 rotation
 out
 of


risk,
 which
 is
 very,
 very
 healthy.
 I


feel


when
 the
 S&P
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


alltime
 highs.
 GM,
 they
 put
 up
 a
 great


earnings
 today.
 They
 deserve
 it.
 GM
 put


up
 a
 great
 earnings.
 You
 know,
 I
 don't


invest
 in
 GM,
 but
 you
 can't
 deny
 a
 30%


EPS.
 It's
 up
 26%
 now
 year-to-
 date,
 12%


today


based
 on
 some
 good
 numbers.
 Are
 you


going
 to
 cover
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


crypto
 meeting
 today?
 So,
 thank
 you
 for


that
 comment
 because
 uh
 yes,
 I
 will
 be


covering
 it.
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's


going
 to
 be
 live
 streamed,
 but
 there


will
 be
 a
 meeting
 today.
 And
 this
 is


actually
 really
 important.
 So,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


panel
 around
 stable
 coin
 use
 cases
 and


tokenized
 products.
 The
 COO
 of
 BlackRock


will
 be
 in
 the
 tokenized
 product
 um


panel.
 Kathy
 Wood
 is
 going
 to
 be
 there


for
 uh
 another
 panel
 and
 then
 the
 circle


president
 is
 going
 to
 be
 there
 for
 the


stablecoin
 panel.
 I
 think
 that
 and
 then


the
 chain
 link
 founder
 is
 going
 to
 be


there
 for
 another
 panel.
 I
 think
 this
 is


super
 bullish
 because
 the
 fact
 that
 the


Federal
 Reserve,
 one
 of the
 entities


that's
 been
 the
 most
 dogmatic
 around


crypto
 over
 the
 past
 essentially
 decade,


is
 hosting
 multiple
 panels
 in
 one
 day


around
 different
 crypto
 ideas
 like


stable
 coins
 and
 tokenization.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 super
 bullish
 crypto


just
 as
 an
 industry
 even
 if
 you
 know


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 have
 been
 flat
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 So,
 uh,
 it
 is


good
 to
 see
 that
 and
 hopefully
 we
 get


some
 updates
 from
 that
 and
 then
 I'll


report
 about
 it
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Bit


mine
 right
 there
 5216


that
 is
 down


3%
 on
 the
 day.


We're
 losing
 money.
 Stop
 saying
 healthy.


Okay,
 hold
 on.
 L
 If
 you're
 losing
 money


in
 Oaklo
 and
 you
 bought
 it
 at
 190,
 I'm


sorry,
 but
 that
 is
 very
 healthy
 to
 not


see
 the
 froth
 in
 Oaklo.
 Now,
 if
 you


bought
 it
 at
 190,
 it
 sucks
 for
 you.


Like,
 just
 if
 we're
 gonna
 be
 honest,
 but


that
 does
 not
 mean
 it
 is
 not
 healthy
 to


see
 Oaklow
 come
 down.
 If
 you
 bought


Robin
 Hood
 at
 150,
 it
 sucks
 you
 bought


it
 at
 150,
 but
 it
 does
 not
 mean
 that


it's
 not
 healthy
 to
 see
 Robin
 Hood
 come


back
 to
 reality
 because
 it
 probably


didn't
 deserve
 to
 be
 at
 150.


Like,
 dude,
 there
 is
 no
 way
 one
 can
 say


that
 this
 is
 not
 healthy.
 This
 is
 the


most
 healthy
 you
 could
 possibly
 imagine.


Grab
 has
 seven
 billion
 in
 cra
 cash
 going


25%
 year-over-year.


When
 Grab
 goes
 down,
 that
 seems
 more


like,
 okay,
 the
 shorts
 are
 involved.


There's
 manipulation.
 There
 could
 be


something
 going
 on.
 Maybe
 there's
 some


narrative
 that
 we
 might
 not
 know
 about,


but
 that
 is
 a
 company
 with
 a
 healthy


balance
 sheet
 that
 is
 profitable
 and


growing.
 Oaklo
 is
 up
 2,000%
 this
 year,


has
 no
 cash,
 no
 earnings,
 no
 revenue,
 no


contracts.
 They
 just
 have
 a
 narrative.


So
 it
 it's
 not
 healthy
 to
 see
 stocks


with
 a
 large
 pile
 of
 cash
 and
 actual


earnings
 go
 down.
 It
 is
 very
 healthy
 to


see
 nonsense
 come
 back
 down
 to
 reality.


It's
 just
 that
 simple.


Like
 this
 is
 the
 nature
 of
 how
 the
 stock


market
 operates
 when
 stupid
 companies
 go


to
 the
 moon.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's


stupid
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a


sense
 that
 they
 can't
 ever
 have


potential
 or
 they
 can't
 get
 a
 bunch
 of


contracts,
 but
 the
 stock
 price
 action


was
 stupid.
 Like
 let's
 just
 be
 honest


about
 it.
 It
 it
 does
 not
 make
 sense.


There's
 no
 way
 to
 justify
 it


quantitatively
 or
 qualitatively.
 The


only
 qualitative
 argument
 you
 can
 make


is
 nuclear
 energy
 is
 important.
 Okay,


how
 long
 does
 it
 take
 to
 set
 up
 a
 small


a
 small
 modular
 reactor?
 5
 years,
 10


years?
 How
 many
 has
 Oaklo
 set
 up?
 How


much
 revenue
 have
 they
 potentially
 even


had
 in
 their
 backlog
 to
 generate
 from


that?
 Like
 it's
 not
 even
 picking
 on


Oaklo.
 It's
 Oaklo
 is
 a
 metaphor
 for
 all


these
 companies
 that
 ran
 up
 for
 no


reason.


It
 doesn't
 make
 sense.


It
 does
 not.
 Amazon
 pumping
 today.
 It


makes
 way
 more
 sense
 than
 an
 Oaklo


getting
 back
 to
 190.
 Amazon
 right
 there


220.
 That's
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Yeah,
 it
 always
 comes
 back
 to


fundamentals.


Pouncer
 is
 an
 exception
 because
 you
 like


it.
 Pouncer
 is
 not
 an
 exception
 because


I
 like
 it.
 I
 have
 said
 I
 mean
 if
 you've


been
 actually
 watching
 the
 channel
 for


the
 past
 four
 years,
 especially
 since


Paler
 started
 making
 its
 run
 in
 2024,
 I


was
 the
 first
 person
 to
 say
 Paler
 is


getting
 ridiculously
 expensive.
 However,


the
 one
 thing
 Pounder
 is
 doing
 that


Oaklow
 or
 DWave
 or
 any
 of
 this
 other


crap
 is
 not
 doing
 is
 growing
 50%.
 With


60%
 free
 cash
 flow
 margins
 and
 45%


adjusted
 operating
 margins.
 You
 can


disagree
 with
 the
 multiple
 on
 the
 stock.


You
 can't
 disagree
 that
 they
 probably


don't
 deserve
 a
 multiple
 because
 of


their
 growth.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Hood.
 Same


thing
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 companies


that,
 you
 know,
 does
 Oracle
 really


deserve
 to
 be
 worth
 800
 billion?
 Maybe


not.
 But
 Oracle
 is
 growing
 like
 crazy
 in


terms
 of
 how
 they're
 a
 massive


hyperscaler
 in
 the
 age
 of
 cloud


computing
 for
 AI.
 These
 other
 companies


have
 nothing.
 You
 can
 disagree
 with
 the


multiple
 on
 some
 of
 these
 stocks.
 You


cannot
 compare
 them
 to
 companies
 that


have
 nothing
 other
 than
 a
 name
 and
 a


retail
 audience
 that
 is
 pumping
 them
 up.


Like
 that
 is
 the
 difference.
 Does
 Apple


deserve
 a
 35
 PE?
 Probably
 not.
 Apple's


growing
 like
 3%
 year-over-year,
 but


Apple's
 also
 buying
 back
 a
 hundred


billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 stock.
 Apple
 is


also
 going
 through
 an
 upgrade
 cycle
 with


with
 iPhone
 17.
 And
 Siri
 might
 end
 up


becoming
 one
 of the
 biggest
 AI
 consumer


products
 next
 year,
 which
 is
 why
 those


are
 substantive
 things
 you
 could
 say


probably
 deserves
 a
 multiple.
 You
 can


disagree,
 maybe
 it
 should
 be
 27
 instead


of
 35,
 but
 disagreeing
 on
 a
 multiple
 is


different
 from
 saying
 that
 Apple
 doesn't


deserve
 any
 premium.
 A
 lot
 of
 these


other
 companies
 probably
 don't
 deserve


any
 premium
 because
 there's
 nothing


there.
 And
 it's
 good
 for
 that
 to
 be


wiped
 out.


It's
 really,
 really
 important
 for
 that


to
 be
 wiped
 out.


He's
 being
 moody
 today.
 No,
 I'm
 just


like,
 bro,
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 this
 bull


market
 going.
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 it
 going.


Nebas,
 by
 the
 way,
 104.
 It
 looks
 like
 I


might
 get
 signed
 on
 my
 98
 puts.
 Um,
 and


to
 keep
 this
 bull
 market
 going,
 you


cannot
 have
 these
 stocks
 go
 to
 the
 moon.


Like,
 you
 just
 can't.


It
 starts
 to
 look
 like
 a
 bubble
 when
 a


lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 go
 to
 the
 moon
 for


no
 reason.
 And
 the
 best
 way
 to
 hedge


against
 that
 is
 for
 those
 stocks
 to
 die


out.


It's
 important.


It's
 very,
 very,
 very
 important.
 Amid


sounds
 like
 an
 ex-wife.
 Yes.
 sound
 like


an
 X-wave.
 And
 I'm
 not
 even
 trying
 to


offend
 people
 that
 are
 in
 these
 names.
 I


feel
 like
 if
 you're
 in
 these
 names,
 you


should
 know
 that
 these
 like
 again
 I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 many
 times
 I
 have
 to
 say


it.
 I'm
 in
 Robin
 Hood
 heavily
 and
 I
 know


it
 didn't
 doesn't
 deserve
 150.
 Am
 I


happy
 it
 gets
 there?
 Sure.
 Am
 I
 crying


that
 it's
 not
 there
 anymore?
 Absolutely


not.
 A
 because
 I
 didn't
 buy
 a
 150


because
 I
 had
 enough
 level
 of


reasonability
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 it
 probably


doesn't
 deserve
 to
 just
 go
 to
 the
 moon


for
 no
 reason,
 even
 if
 it
 got
 into
 the


S&P."
 And
 then
 B,
 it's
 like
 the
 stock
 is


up
 230%
 even
 if
 it's
 down
 from
 150.


Oaklo,
 if
 we
 look
 at
 its
 year-to
 date,


is
 still
 up
 575%


and
 they
 have
 not
 grown
 anywhere
 near


like
 how
 Robin's
 grown,
 even
 though
 it's


down
 from
 190.


Like,
 this
 is
 my
 point.
 It's
 like
 it
 it


takes
 a
 $40
 drop
 and
 it's
 still
 up
 5x,


which
 means
 it
 could
 take
 another
 30
 40%


drop.
 would
 still
 be
 up
 2x
 and
 like
 no


one
 could
 be
 that
 upset
 about
 it.
 Or
 at


least
 if
 you
 own
 it,
 you
 shouldn't
 be


that
 upset
 about
 it
 because
 you
 probably


know
 it
 might
 not
 have
 deserved
 to
 be
 up


10x
 in
 the
 first
 place.


Yeah,
 it's
 only
 up
 500%.


That's
 my
 point.
 It's
 not
 to
 pick
 on
 any


of
 these
 companies.
 Like
 I
 I'm
 not
 I'm


not
 trying
 to
 be
 biased
 to
 anything.
 I'm


just
 saying
 like
 froth
 is
 froth.
 You


either
 either
 understand
 froth
 or
 you


don't
 understand
 froth.
 And
 if
 Oakland's


not
 froth
 to
 you,
 then
 I
 don't
 know
 what


is
 froth.
 Apploven
 right
 here
 five.
 Like


does
 apploven
 deserve
 to
 be
 down
 from


800?
 Maybe
 it
 deserves
 to
 be
 down.
 Does


deserve
 to
 be
 down
 as
 aggressively
 as


it's
 down?
 No.
 But
 they
 have
 a
 narrative


around
 the
 SEC
 probing
 them
 for


advertising
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 this
 one's


getting
 hit.


Oaklo
 has
 a
 narrative
 around
 nuclear


energy
 that
 has
 not
 manifested
 in


anything
 real.
 This
 apploven
 thing
 is


probably
 going
 to
 go
 away
 in
 a
 couple


months,
 but
 Apploven's
 getting
 hers
 hurt


worse
 than
 Oaklo.
 How
 does
 that
 make


sense?


It
 really
 doesn't
 fully
 fully
 make
 sense


right
 here.


Google
 253,
 that's
 down
 from
 255.
 S&P


going
 red
 on
 the
 day
 but
 still
 holding


670


for
 what
 we
 have
 right
 now.


Uh
 would
 you
 like
 grab
 below
 550?
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 look
 I
 like
 grabb
 right
 here
 as


well
 there.
 I
 there's
 not
 much
 I
 can
 say


for
 why
 grab
 is
 down
 from
 630
 other
 than


because
 there's
 no
 narrative.
 If
 anyone


has
 a
 headline
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 the


headline
 and
 this
 is
 why
 I'm
 saying
 it's


chalking
 it
 up
 to
 shorts
 and


manipulation
 and
 the
 data
 that
 we
 have


on
 that
 is
 the
 short
 float
 went
 from


5.7%
 to
 8.3%
 in
 the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 We


talked
 about
 this
 two
 days
 ago.
 So
 all
 I


can
 say
 is
 grab
 reminds
 me
 of
 SoFi
 right


now
 when
 it
 was
 stuck
 at
 six,
 seven


bucks
 and
 the
 shorts
 would
 just
 could


not
 believe
 that
 you
 know
 SoFi
 was
 ever


going
 to
 grow.
 So
 they
 kept
 shorting
 it.


Guess
 what?
 No
 put
 up
 the
 good
 earnings.


The
 shorts
 got
 the
 hell
 out
 and
 the


stock
 moved
 higher.
 I
 think
 that
 could


be
 the
 same
 trajectory.
 Um
 but
 I
 don't


have
 a
 fundamental
 narrative
 for
 why
 it


deserved
 to
 lose
 650
 when
 it
 was
 trading


there
 for
 about
 a
 month.


But
 that's
 different
 from
 like
 an
 Oaklo


or
 a
 DW,
 right?
 It's
 just
 different
 from


some
 of
 these
 other
 stocks
 that
 ran
 up


thousands
 of
 percent.
 One
 could
 argue


for
 no
 reason.
 And
 now
 they're
 taking
 a


bit
 of
 a
 breather.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 Oaklo


might
 not
 ever
 get
 back
 down
 to
 1020


bucks.
 It
 might
 normalize
 in
 the
 100s,


which
 again
 would
 still
 keep
 it
 up
 3


400%
 for
 the
 year,
 but
 it
 it
 just
 might


not
 get
 back
 to
 195,
 which
 again,
 I
 just


don't
 think
 anyone
 can
 meaningfully


complain
 about.


Also,
 Grab
 has
 84%
 institutional


ownership.
 Oaklo
 does
 not.
 Like
 look
 at


where
 the
 smart
 money
 is
 going.


Sometimes
 the
 stock
 price
 action
 is
 not


indicative
 of
 where
 the
 smart
 money
 is


loading
 up
 on
 and
 those
 are
 things
 you


have
 to
 see
 through
 versus
 companies


that
 have
 nothing
 going
 for
 them
 in


regards
 to
 smart
 money
 or
 institutional


ownership
 because
 there
 is
 no
 real


institutional
 ownership
 because
 the


institutions
 don't
 care
 and
 that
 is
 a


fundamental
 difference.
 Roblox
 right


there
 down
 1%
 on
 the
 day
 and
 then
 the


Q's
 down.13%


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 get


any
 macro
 data.
 Let
 me
 also
 pull
 up
 the


heat
 map
 here.
 It's
 definitely
 a
 red
 day


for
 what
 we're
 seeing.


Um,


actually


it's
 red,
 but
 it's
 also
 green.
 It's
 just


a
 very
 small
 green.
 Apple's
 up,
 Amazon's


up,
 Meta's
 up,
 Birkshshire's
 up,
 Lily's


up,
 consumer
 defenses
 are
 down,


industrials
 are
 green,
 Microsoft's
 up,


Oracle's
 down.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 a
 mix
 of


green
 and
 red.
 Google's
 getting
 hit
 the


worst
 in
 the
 Max
 7.
 Then,
 Amazon's


getting
 the
 most


up
 1.4%.


People
 shouldn't
 be
 People
 shouldn't
 be


down
 that
 much
 today,
 but
 they
 probably


aren't
 up
 a
 ton
 as
 well.
 Wow.
 Apple
 new


alltime
 highs.
 Yep,
 look
 at
 Apple.


264.84.
 It
 hit
 265


a
 second
 ago.
 It
 just
 got
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 notification.
 Warner


Brothers
 Discovery
 says
 it's
 exploring
 a


potential
 sale
 of
 all
 or
 some
 of
 its


media
 holdings,
 which
 include
 HBO
 and


CNN.


That
 is
 wild,
 bro.
 Warner
 Brothers
 has


been
 around
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 The
 fact


that
 they're
 basically
 saying
 HBO
 Max


failed.
 That's
 basically
 what
 they're


saying.
 They're
 basically
 saying
 they


weren't
 able
 to
 compete
 in
 the
 streaming


era,
 which
 like,
 yeah,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to


compete
 in
 the
 streaming
 era.
 And
 HBO


Max
 has
 some
 really
 good
 content,
 but


still,


Warner
 Brothers
 was
 a
 media
 company.


They
 decided
 to
 become
 a
 tech
 company


with
 the
 streaming
 platform.
 And
 it's


not
 easy
 to
 compete
 with
 technology.


It's
 not
 easy
 to
 compete
 with
 Apple
 Plus


and
 Netflix.
 And
 like,
 that's
 a
 whole


different
 ballgame.


A
 whole
 Also,
 CNN
 Plus
 ruthlessly


failed.
 I
 mean,
 that
 thing
 lasted
 for


literally
 five
 days
 before
 they
 shut
 it


down.
 So,
 that
 one
 also
 did
 not
 give


them
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum.
 Iran
 right
 there


down
 5%
 of the
 day
 continues
 to
 go
 down.


Baba's
 down
 3%.
 The
 VIX
 actually
 up
 2.8.


So,
 you
 got
 the
 VIX
 moving
 higher.
 Uh,


still
 below
 20,
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see,


but
 the
 VIX
 is
 up.
 The
 final
 season
 of


Game
 of
 Thrones
 literally
 killed
 HBO.


Agreed.
 And
 I
 didn't
 even
 watch
 Game
 of


Thrones,
 but
 from
 all
 my
 friends
 that
 I


heard
 about,
 they
 could
 not
 stand
 the


ending
 of
 Game
 of
 Thrones.
 So
 maybe
 that


was
 the
 the
 nail
 in
 the
 coffin.


Why
 is
 Google
 down?
 Google
 is
 not
 Oaklo.


Okay,
 so
 again
 like
 we
 cannot
 make
 these


types
 of
 comparisons.
 Google
 is
 Google


and
 Google
 will
 go
 up,
 Google
 will
 go


down.
 It's
 it's
 a
 stock.
 A
 stock
 will
 go


up,
 a
 stock
 will
 go
 down.
 The
 difference


between
 Google
 and
 Oaklo
 outside
 of
 a


couple
 trillion
 dollars
 in
 market
 cap
 is


that
 Google
 does
 a hundred
 billion


dollars
 in
 profit
 every
 year.
 Oaklo
 does


nothing.


So,
 when
 I
 say
 Oaklo's
 not
 getting
 back


to
 all-time
 highs,
 there's
 a
 difference.


Oaklo
 now
 down
 8%
 on
 the
 day.


Google
 will
 probably
 continue
 to
 grow


over
 the
 next
 decade
 and
 they
 will


probably
 more
 valuable
 than
 what
 they


are
 today.
 And
 Google
 itself
 had
 a


narrative
 issue
 for
 nine
 months
 this


year
 that
 it
 just
 broke
 out
 of
 three


weeks
 ago.


Oaklo
 might
 be
 able
 to
 grow
 over
 the


next
 10
 years
 if
 they
 actually
 end
 up


putting
 up
 the
 earnings
 results,
 but
 as


of
 now,
 none
 of
 that's
 there.
 And


they're
 getting
 a
 massive
 premium
 for
 no


reason.
 That
 That's
 my
 point.
 That's
 the


point.
 It's
 not
 about
 comparing
 stocks


that
 are
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 It's
 about
 the


velocity
 at
 which
 one
 went
 to
 the
 moon


and
 then
 came
 back
 down
 and
 another
 one


that
 is
 down
 1%
 but
 is
 up
 from
 150


because
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about


the
 DOJ
 anymore.


It's
 completely
 different
 sectors,


different
 names,
 but
 different


opportunities
 to
 understand
 across
 the


board.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 see
 this
 is
 the


problem.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 to


explain
 the
 difference
 between
 Google


and
 Oaklo.
 And
 this
 is
 has
 this
 is
 this


is
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 conversation
 I
 was


having
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 This
 is
 what


made
 me
 scared
 on
 Technical
 Tuesday
 last


week.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 chat


asking
 for
 these
 penny
 stocks
 and
 TA
 on


all
 these
 random
 OTC
 companies.
 And
 I'm


like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 good
 sign.
 This


is
 too
 many
 people
 are
 trying
 to
 find


the
 next
 shiny
 object."
 And
 now
 having


to
 explain
 the
 difference
 between
 Google


and
 Oaklow
 continues
 to
 reinforce
 that


point
 that
 there
 is
 froth
 in
 the
 system.


That
 froth
 is
 not
 indicative
 of
 a
 market


top
 in
 my
 opinion
 because
 that
 froth


could
 go
 to
 zero
 and
 Nvidia
 will
 be


fine.
 But
 it's
 not
 good
 in
 any
 sense
 of


the
 imagination
 objectively
 to
 have
 that


froth
 if
 we're
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 the
 next


leg
 up
 on
 the
 S&P.


We
 should
 have
 good
 quality
 companies


join
 the
 rally
 and
 diversify
 in
 the


rally,
 not
 your
 random
 run-of-the-mill


narrative
 on
 an
 OTC
 that
 someone
 saw
 on


Twitter
 and
 that
 now
 is
 going
 crazy


because
 they
 bought
 10,000
 shares


because
 it's
 $2
 and
 they
 think
 it's


going to
 go
 to
 $5.


It's
 just
 not
 healthy.


And
 maybe
 in
 2020
 when
 I
 was
 five
 years


ago
 and
 I
 was
 a
 much
 more
 naive


investor,
 I
 would
 have
 said,
 "Oh
 yeah,


that's
 awesome."
 And
 now
 I'm
 just
 like,


"No,
 this
 is
 stupid.
 This
 is
 stupid."


Objectively,
 it's
 stupid.
 We
 need
 to


call
 it
 what
 it
 is.
 And
 we
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 does
 not
 permeate


across
 the
 market.


And
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 I
 I
 I've


lost
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 betting
 on
 those


names
 back
 in
 2020.
 Like
 it's
 you
 go


through
 the
 hard
 lessons
 of
 losing
 money


and
 then
 you
 realize,
 oh,
 that
 stuff
 is


stupid.


and
 you
 try
 not
 to
 lose
 money
 anymore,


but
 having
 it
 come
 back


is
 not
 the
 best
 thing
 that
 we
 want
 to


see.
 Nabius
 right
 here
 also
 getting


wrecked
 10471.
 It
 did
 hit
 102.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 one
 wants
 to
 go


below
 100,
 but
 10454.
 Nabius,
 by
 the


way,
 even
 after
 this
 decline
 from
 140
 to


104
 is
 still
 up
 240%
 year
 to
 date.
 And


Nebius
 is
 not
 a
 meme
 stock.
 Nebius
 is
 a


legit
 company
 with
 legit
 earnings,
 legit


revenue,
 quite
 frankly,
 a
 fantastic


revenue
 growth
 rate
 after
 that.


Microsoft
 news.
 So,
 you
 know,
 no
 one


should
 be
 complaining
 that
 Nebis
 is
 down


from
 140.
 It's
 still
 up
 more
 than
 2.5x


for
 the
 year.


But
 when
 people
 complain
 about
 that


stuff,
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 much
 greed
 is


really
 in
 the
 markets
 and
 that
 stuff


needs
 to
 get
 wiped
 out.


It
 just
 has
 to
 get
 wiped
 out.
 Eatzilla


did
 a
 reverse
 split
 and
 that's
 why
 ETHZ


is
 uh
 down
 12%
 on
 the
 day.
 Reverse


splits.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 another
 function


of
 these
 stocks
 getting
 overhyped.
 I've


been
 in
 stocks
 that
 do
 a
 reverse
 split


and
 then,
 you
 know,
 you
 go
 from
 10,000


shares
 to
 100
 shares
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 the


share
 price
 goes
 up
 in
 order
 for
 it
 to


continue
 being
 listed
 on
 the
 NASDAQ


because
 you
 have
 to
 be
 above
 a
 certain


price,
 but
 your
 share
 your
 actual
 shares


go
 down.
 Your
 ownership
 in
 the


percentage
 company
 stays
 the
 same,
 but


the
 stock
 usually
 sells
 off
 after
 a


verse
 split
 because
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 be


part
 of
 a
 company
 that
 can't
 even
 keep


their
 share
 price
 above.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


what
 almost
 happened
 to
 Openor
 at
 50


cents.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 above
 a
 dollar
 to


be
 listed.
 And
 then
 Eric
 Jackson
 came
 in


and
 kind
 of
 started
 that
 movement
 that


changed
 the
 narrative
 with
 open
 door,


but
 they
 were
 about
 to
 go
 through
 a
 re
 a


reverse
 split
 just
 to
 stay
 listed.


So
 companies
 that
 don't
 have
 a
 massive


retail
 movement
 like
 an
 open
 door,
 you


know,
 they're
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to


end
 up
 taking
 that
 reverse
 split
 because


there's
 no
 other
 option
 they
 have
 to


stay
 listed
 on
 the
 NASDAQ
 or
 on
 the
 on


the
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange.


But
 we
 are
 relatively
 seeing
 a
 red
 day.


Gold.
 Gold
 is
 still


Wow.
 Gold
 loses
 42.


We
 were
 at
 freaking
 42
 during
 the


pre-market.
 Look
 at
 that.
 4180.
 So,
 gold


is
 actually
 officially
 getting
 hit


today.


Silver,
 are
 we
 below
 49?
 Wow.
 Silver,


hold
 on.


12
 cents
 away
 from
 49.
 12
 cents
 away


from
 from
 losing
 49.
 And
 then
 you
 get
 to


the
 48s


and
 we
 see
 what
 goes
 down
 from
 there.


Silver
 down
 6%,
 Grab
 now
 down
 4%
 and


gold


down
 4.2%
 as
 well.
 Oscar
 announced
 a


partnership
 with
 OpenAI
 yesterday.


That's
 why
 Oscar
 is
 running.
 Um,
 looks


like
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 incorporating


more
 agents
 into
 their
 healthcare


facilities.
 So
 Oscar
 right
 there,
 that's


up
 3.2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 it's
 a


good
 partnership.
 The
 real
 thing
 that


matters
 about
 Oscar
 is
 when
 this


shutdown
 is
 going to
 end.
 And
 so
 far
 we


don't
 really
 have
 updates
 on
 it.
 Mike


Johnson,
 he
 was
 live
 this
 morning
 and


basically
 he
 said


um
 I
 mean
 he
 said
 the
 same
 thing,
 right?


He
 said
 it's
 a
 Schumer
 shutdown.
 He
 said


the
 Democrats
 are
 to
 blame.
 I
 mean
 they


they
 every
 time
 they
 go
 live
 they
 say


the
 same
 thing.
 They
 just
 blame
 each


other.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going


to
 get
 any
 capitulation.
 You
 did
 have


Hasset
 yesterday
 say
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this


week
 there
 might
 be
 some
 type
 of
 a
 deal.


You
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if


that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 But


as
 of
 now,
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 remedy
 for


the
 shutdown


shutdown
 yet.


Chia
 says,
 "This
 is
 why
 you
 shouldn't


FOMO."
 I
 agree.


This
 is
 also
 why


you
 shouldn't
 FOMO.
 Um,


this
 is
 what
 Mike
 Johnson
 said
 about
 20


minutes
 ago
 on
 the
 shutdown.


Was


that
 muted?
 Was
 that
 muted?
 Oops,
 that


was
 muted.
 My
 bad.


>> All right,
 it's
 back.


>> Is
 so
 clear.
 Remember,
 it
 was
 over
 a


month
 ago
 that
 the
 House
 did
 our
 job
 and


we
 passed
 a
 clean
 continued
 resolution,


a
 totally
 nonpartisan
 24-page,
 very


simple
 piece
 of
 legislation
 to
 just
 keep


the
 lights
 on
 so
 that
 Congress
 could


continue
 to
 do
 the
 work
 of
 appropriating


the
 the
 funds
 for
 the
 annual
 budget
 and


also
 for
 navigating
 all
 the
 rest
 of
 the


issues
 we
 have
 on
 the
 table
 throughout


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 The
 the
 Democrats


voted
 it
 down.
 They've
 done
 it
 now


almost
 a
 dozen
 times,
 as
 you
 said,


because
 they're
 playing
 partisan
 games.


They
 filed
 a
 counter
 proposal.
 Uh
 don't


let's
 not
 let
 anybody
 forget
 what
 they


filed
 as
 their
 their
 counter
 offer.


Their
 CR
 is
 not
 a
 clean
 one.
 It's
 a


dirty
 one
 because
 they
 want
 to
 spend
 up


trillion
 half
 new
 dollars
 on
 all
 sorts


of
 wasteful
 programs,
 including
 $200


billion
 to
 fund
 health
 care
 benefits
 on


the
 backs
 of
 American
 taxpayers
 for


illegal
 aliens.
 They
 want
 to
 give
 a
 half


a
 billion
 dollars
 back
 to
 the


Corporation
 for
 Public
 Broadcasting
 to


prop
 up
 leftist
 news
 organizations.
 and


they
 want
 to
 spend
 billions
 of
 dollars


overseas
 on
 all
 sorts
 of
 extraneous


crazy
 kinds
 of
 programs.


>> Day
 21
 of
 the
 shutdown
 and
 on
 the
 21st


day,
 what
 is
 Johnson
 doing?
 He
 continues


to
 point
 the
 fingers
 at
 Democrats
 and


the
 Democrats
 are
 pointing
 the
 fingers


at
 the
 Republicans.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I


don't
 know
 what
 gets
 them
 to
 the
 table.


The
 other
 quote
 that
 Hasset
 had


yesterday
 was
 that
 if
 the
 uh
 if
 the


shutdown
 doesn't
 happen,
 uh
 the


government
 will
 look
 into
 more
 strategic


options
 to
 get
 the
 Democrats
 to
 the


table.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 means.
 I


don't
 know
 how,
 you
 know,
 if
 they
 don't


negotiate
 on
 healthcare,
 which
 is
 the


biggest
 lynch
 pin
 of
 getting
 the


shutdown
 to
 be
 resolved,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 else
 they're
 going
 to
 focus
 on.
 But


it
 just
 doesn't
 look
 like
 they're
 easily


getting
 to
 resolve
 things.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 be


shut
 down
 until
 this
 ends
 up
 fixing
 up.


Um,


so
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 the
 shutdown.


Caliber
 says,
 "Amit
 you
 can
 still
 be


honest
 and
 truthful
 about
 these
 energy


stocks
 without
 being
 an
 ass
 about
 it."
 I


don't
 think
 I'm
 being
 an
 ass
 about
 it,


dude.
 I
 If
 if
 if
 being
 an
 ass
 if if


saying
 Oaklo
 is
 up
 5x
 even
 after
 it's


down
 40
 bucks
 and
 it
 probably
 doesn't


deserve
 to
 be
 193
 is
 being
 an
 ass,
 then


okay,
 I
 guess
 I'm
 an
 ass.
 If
 someone


gets
 offended
 by
 saying
 Oaklo
 is
 up
 500%


and
 probably
 doesn't
 deserve
 to
 go
 up


another
 30%.


Even
 after
 it's
 up
 500%
 on
 no
 revenue


and
 no
 earnings,


then
 I
 I
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 new


definition
 of
 an
 these
 days.
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 like
 that's
 this
 is
 also


this
 is
 not
 saying,
 hey
 AMD
 deserves
 to


go
 to
 It's
 not
 saying
 Google


deserves
 to
 go.
 It's
 saying
 a
 company


with
 no
 revenue
 and
 no
 earnings
 doesn't


deserve
 to
 be
 up
 6,000%.


I
 think
 that's
 I
 think
 that's
 actually


being
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 responsible


around
 thinking
 of
 some
 of
 these
 names


in
 a
 bull
 market
 that
 I
 want
 to
 see


continue.
 My
 life
 is
 more
 fun
 if
 the


bull
 market
 continues.
 But
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 fun
 if
 we
 say,
 "Oh,
 look,


Oakllo
 is
 going
 to
 the
 moon."
 Like,


that's
 not
 fun.


And
 it's
 not
 fun
 because
 even
 if
 I
 owned


Oakllo,
 I
 I
 I
 know
 that
 that's
 not


sustainable.
 Like,
 it's
 just
 not.
 Every


market
 has
 not
 had
 the
 ability
 to


sustain
 stupid
 names
 going
 up
 on
 nothing


other
 than
 narratives.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 Paler
 was
 a
 narrative


stock
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Guess
 what


happened
 in
 the
 early
 2024.
 They
 put
 up


the
 growth.


I
 mean,
 pound
 the
 paler
 would
 have
 been


a
 narrative
 stock
 for
 the
 past
 couple


years
 if
 they
 had
 not
 pivoted
 in
 2024


and
 actually
 started
 growing
 upwards
 of


30%
 now
 at
 50%.


But
 they
 put
 up
 the
 growth
 and
 the


growth
 changed
 everything.
 So
 if
 Oak


puts
 up
 the
 growth,
 the
 narrative


changes
 everything.
 Like
 you
 start
 to


get
 something
 substantial.
 If
 D-Wave


puts
 up
 the
 growth,
 the
 narrative


changes.
 But
 like
 these
 companies
 aren't


putting
 up
 any
 growth,
 there's
 nothing.


It's
 vaporware.
 It's
 just
 excitement.


And
 if
 you're
 in
 these
 stocks,
 you
 have


to
 understand
 that
 as
 well.
 And
 if
 that


it
 gets
 you
 offended,
 then
 I
 I
 don't


know
 what
 to
 say.
 I'm
 not
 shorting
 them.


I
 don't
 have
 an
 agenda.
 I
 don't
 have


puts
 on
 these
 things.
 I
 don't
 have
 an


agenda
 to
 make
 them
 come
 down.
 I
 just


want
 to
 be
 more
 reasonable
 about
 the


health
 of
 this
 bull
 market


because
 if
 we
 lose
 momentum
 across
 the


actual
 stocks
 that
 matter,
 then
 then
 you


can
 kiss
 Oaklo
 goodbye.
 If
 Nvidia
 falls


20%,
 yeah,
 like
 that
 then
 you're
 really


done.
 But
 the
 only
 way
 for
 Nvidia
 to
 not


fall
 20%
 is
 for
 the
 health
 of
 the
 bull


market
 to
 actually
 be
 sustainable
 enough


where
 a
 stock
 like
 Oaklo
 can
 still
 be
 up


5x,
 even
 2x
 if
 it
 falls
 another
 30%.


without
 earnings.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 most
 important


thing
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 this
 out.
 Is


flushing
 out
 all
 the
 froth
 by
 himself.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 To
 aid's
 point,
 Oaklo
 can't


even
 produce
 energy
 until
 at
 least
 2030.


Yeah,
 dude.
 What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?


What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?
 I
 don't
 care


if
 the
 secretary
 of
 energy
 knows
 the


brothers
 on
 the
 board
 of
 directors.


Like,
 all
 this
 stuff
 is
 nonsense.
 Like,


where's
 the
 where's
 the
 actual
 growth?


Where's
 the
 actual
 earnings?
 Until
 we


get
 that,


we
 cannot
 be
 championing
 these
 names.


It's
 just
 that
 simple.


It's
 just
 that
 simple.


Um,
 where's
 BMR?
 What
 do
 we
 have
 on
 BMR?


And
 again,
 I
 I
 know
 some
 people
 think


that
 BMR
 is
 similar
 to
 that
 category,


but
 that
 I
 think
 that
 misses
 the
 point


of
 understanding
 Ethereum.
 You
 can
 hate


a
 digital
 asset
 treasury.
 That's
 fine.


you
 don't
 have
 to
 like
 the
 concept
 of
 of


a
 DAT,
 but
 to
 to
 have
 beef
 with
 BMR,
 you


need
 to
 have
 much
 more
 sophisticated


beef
 with
 Ethereum.
 And
 Ethereum,
 I


mean,
 we
 we've
 covered
 the
 story
 pretty


extensively
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


weeks,
 really
 the
 past
 couple
 months,


ever
 since
 these
 DATs
 started
 getting


excited.
 Ethereum
 is
 showing
 real


growth.
 Stable
 coin
 supply
 is
 300


billion.
 62%
 of
 that
 stable
 coin
 supply,


which
 basically
 wasn't
 even
 an
 industry


10
 years
 ago,
 is
 on
 Ethereum.


tokenization
 across
 the
 board.
 Black


Rockck,
 Robin
 Hood,
 PayPal,
 all
 these


companies
 are
 using
 layer
 2s
 on


Ethereum.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 something


where
 yeah,
 the
 price
 is
 now
 moving
 like


crazy,
 which
 is
 actually
 kind
 of
 bullish


to
 me,
 but
 the
 actual
 uh
 use
 cases,
 I


mean,
 literally
 1.4
 billion
 users
 on


Alipe
 in
 China
 are
 now
 using
 a
 layer
 2


on
 Ethereum.
 Like,
 these
 are
 real
 things


that
 are
 happening
 that
 you
 can
 point
 to


versus
 just
 pure
 narratives
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day.
 Amazon,
 are
 we
 moving
 past


220?
 Amazon
 221
 that's
 up
 2.16%.
 So
 some


of
 this
 money
 coming
 out
 of
 froth
 and


going
 into
 Amazon


going
 into
 Amazon.


AS
 is
 the
 same
 as
 Oakllo.
 So
 the
 only


reason
 I
 would
 disagree
 here
 and
 yes


doesn't
 have
 revenue
 is
 AS
 has
 a
 lot
 of


deals
 in
 the
 pipeline
 that
 one
 can


easily
 see
 the
 revenue
 coming.
 Oaklo
 has


actually
 nothing.
 Dude,
 that's
 the


difference.


ESTs
 is
 a
 phenomenal
 business
 model
 and


they
 have
 tons
 of
 deals
 and
 partnerships


with
 massive
 companies
 like
 a
 Verizon


where
 the
 revenue
 is
 coming
 like
 there's


actually
 something
 substantially
 you


could
 still
 say
 it's
 overvalued
 for
 sure


but
 you
 can't
 say
 there's
 nothing
 there


a
 lot
 of
 these
 other
 names
 that
 have
 run


there
 is
 nothing
 there
 and
 and
 that's


the
 part
 where
 it's
 just
 it
 becomes


something
 that
 ultimately
 is


unsustainable


and
 they
 have
 a
 few
 satellites
 in
 orbit


that's
 also
 true
 as
 well


the
 beer
 spirit
 is
 making
 a
 bit
 grouchy.


There
 you
 go.
 Beyond
 volume
 550
 million,


dude.
 Holy
 crap.
 Still
 up
 45%.
 It
 was
 up


70%.


Uh,
 so
 it's
 down
 from
 that
 70%
 move,


214,


but
 still
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 All right,


let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 econ
 Oh,
 can


Canada's
 inflation
 came
 out.
 Okay,


annual
 inflation
 rate
 in
 Canada
 rose
 to


2.4%
 in
 September.
 Wow,
 that's
 a
 big


move.
 1.9%
 last
 month,
 2.4%.
 Street


thought
 it
 would
 come
 in
 at
 2.3.
 It
 is


the
 first
 time
 inflation
 crossed
 the


Bank
 of
 Canada's
 2%
 threshold
 in
 six


months.


Okay,
 so
 Canada
 not
 really
 signaling
 the


best
 potential
 for
 America's
 CPI,
 which


is
 going
 to
 be
 coming
 out
 on
 Friday.
 I


don't
 even
 know
 how
 they're
 calculating


it
 because
 the
 government
 is
 shut
 down.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 they
 say.


But
 you
 do
 have
 Canada
 inflation
 that's


ramping
 up
 a
 bit
 right
 here.


Not
 really
 affecting
 the
 broader
 market.


But
 that
 is
 one
 piece
 of
 macro
 data.


Nvidia
 right
 here
 down
 1.3%.
 The
 S&P
 500


670


69.
 Shopify
 was
 up
 5%
 yesterday.
 Where


is
 Shopify
 today?
 Down
 2%.
 Pretty
 much


everything
 outside
 of
 Amazon
 quite


frankly
 taking
 a
 hit
 today
 which
 is
 okay


because
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 ran
 up
 yesterday.


S&P
 if
 we
 don't
 lose
 670
 I
 think
 that


would
 be
 pretty
 bullish.
 It
 looks
 like


it
 wants
 to
 lose
 670,
 but
 if
 we
 can
 hold


above
 it,


that
 would
 be
 nice
 to
 see.


Doug
 said,
 "I
 bought
 puts
 on
 D-Wave."


Okay.
 Yeah,
 the
 bottom
 is
 definitely
 in


on
 D-Wave.
 Doug
 Doug


Doug
 is
 officially
 setting.
 Doug,
 did


you
 buy
 it
 at
 freaking
 3184?
 And
 then
 we


got
 these
 green
 candles.


There
 you
 go.
 That's
 your
 bottom


on
 Dwight.


Yeah,
 it
 does
 look
 like
 everyone's


flowing
 into
 uh
 Amazon
 right
 here
 on
 the


day
 221.
 Abselera,
 that's
 down
 2.3%
 as


well.
 That
 one
 taking
 a
 hit.
 Meta
 down


half
 a
 percent.
 Salesforce
 down
 1.24.


I
 mean,
 look,
 Salesforce
 at
 this


valuation.
 I
 don't
 love
 Salesforce
 the


company,
 but
 I
 mean,
 you
 probably
 should


catch
 a
 bid
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 some
 of


these
 people
 looking
 for
 more
 potential


value
 opportunities.
 Bitcoin
 getting


green
 109.4
 before
 and
 then
 Ethereum
 at


3,900.


Ethereum
 at
 3,900.


Where's
 Amcore
 today?
 It
 was
 up
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Amcore
 3201.
 All right,
 so


holding
 above
 32.


Um,


let's
 see
 what
 else
 we
 have


in
 the
 pre-markets
 as
 well.


Um,


Jinszo,
 thanks
 for
 the
 $10
 super
 chat.


Emit,
 have
 you
 considered
 your
 streaming


would
 be
 impacted
 in
 a
 legit
 bare


market,
 say
 three-year
 downturn?
 Is


anyone
 watching?
 That
 actually
 goes
 to


my
 point.
 Like,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 not


stream
 every
 day
 in
 a
 bare
 market.
 It


would
 kind
 of
 suck.
 I
 remember
 2022.
 And


the
 way
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 don't
 have


a
 bare
 market
 as
 easily
 is
 if
 stocks


with
 no
 earnings
 or
 fundamentals
 keep


running
 to
 the
 moon
 because
 at
 that


point,
 you're
 you're
 bound
 to
 get,
 you


know,
 some
 level
 of
 a
 massive


retracement.
 So
 yeah,
 look,
 it's
 not
 as


fun
 to
 care
 about
 the
 markets
 when


everything's
 tanking.
 Uh


but
 you
 know,
 the
 best
 way
 to
 hopefully


not
 have
 that
 happen
 is
 if
 you
 have
 a


slow
 fundamental
 reason
 for
 the
 rally


even
 taking
 place
 in
 the
 first
 place,


which
 is
 which
 is
 what
 matters.
 Um
 Yoko,


thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.


I
 mean,
 could
 you
 do
 a
 deep
 dive
 on


Chime?
 I
 have
 not
 looked
 at
 Chime.
 I


know
 Tanner
 is
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more


interested
 in
 Chime
 Financial
 and
 the


reason
 for
 that
 is
 because
 the
 stock
 is


down
 50%
 from
 its
 IPO.
 Uh
 so
 Tanner


thinks
 it
 looks
 a
 little
 bit
 more


attractive
 here.
 I
 have
 not
 gone
 super


deep
 into
 them.
 I
 can
 take
 a
 look.
 I


know
 that
 Sofi's
 numbers
 are
 objectively


better,
 but
 Chime's
 valuation
 probably


now
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 attractive
 given
 it's


not
 at
 48


and
 back
 down
 to
 18.
 Yeah,
 Tanner
 in
 the


chat
 right
 there,
 he
 says
 it's


definitely
 a
 bit
 more
 interesting.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Um,


when
 markets
 are
 down,
 I've
 noticed


viewership
 is
 way
 up.
 That's
 also
 true,


but
 I
 feel
 like
 so
 like
 when
 the
 market


goes
 down,
 more
 people
 want
 to
 know


what's
 happening,
 right?
 So
 naturally,


viewers
 will
 increase.
 This
 is
 why
 CNBC


tries
 to
 capitalize
 on,
 you
 know,
 like


scaring
 people
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 The


problem
 is
 if
 you
 have
 a
 2022
 type
 of


year
 where
 every
 day
 people
 tune
 in


knowing
 they're
 just
 going
 to
 lose


money,
 people
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 stop


tuning
 in,
 right?
 You
 kind
 of
 check
 out


mentally.
 Now,
 I
 think
 there's
 enough


junkies
 in
 here
 that
 will
 still
 care


about
 the
 markets
 and
 the
 dynamics
 of
 it


every
 single
 day
 because,
 you
 know,


we're
 obsessed
 with
 it.
 But
 the
 general


person
 just
 says,
 "All
 right,
 the


markets
 suck.
 Stock
 market's
 not
 doing


anything.
 Who
 cares?"


Gold,
 by
 the
 way,
 continuing
 to
 go
 down.


Now,
 down
 about
 3.72%.


On
 the
 day.


Um,


yeah,
 Amazon
 really
 is
 one
 of
 the
 only


green
 names
 today.
 Reddit's
 up
 a
 little


bit
 and
 then
 Amazon
 221


2.4%
 and
 it's
 crazy
 that
 after
 the


outage,
 Amazon
 is
 still
 getting
 some
 of


this
 love,


but
 you
 are
 seeing
 it


get
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 move.
 Uh,
 Coca-Cola


CEO
 is
 on.
 Let's
 listen
 to
 him
 and
 see


if
 we
 can
 get
 any
 insight
 on
 what's


going
 on
 with
 the
 state
 of
 the
 consumer


based
 on
 their
 earnings


>> up
 nicely.
 Almost
 4%
 I
 I
 mean
 organic


revenue
 growth
 of
 6%
 is
 higher
 than
 what


we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 industry
 right
 now.


Talk
 about
 what
 you're
 seeing
 from


consumers
 around
 the
 globe.


>> Look,
 we
 we're
 seeing
 the
 strong
 results


from
 Coca-Cola
 because
 we're
 basically


investing
 uh
 in
 a
 great
 industry.
 we're


the
 leader
 and
 we're
 gaining
 share
 and


and
 what
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 is
 to


adapt
 to
 the
 different
 dynamics
 that


consumers
 are
 facing.
 You
 can
 see
 that


in
 the
 US
 uh
 with
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 higher


end
 of
 the
 income
 pyramid
 still
 got
 lots


of
 spending
 power,
 still
 outspending
 and


you
 see
 growth
 in
 the
 channels
 and
 the


products
 uh
 they're
 most
 interested
 in.


Uh
 and
 but
 you
 do
 see
 the
 lower
 income


consumers
 under
 pressure
 uh
 doing
 some


value
 seeking
 behavior
 whether
 that
 be


channel
 or
 the
 pack
 sizes
 or
 the
 price


point.
 You
 see
 some
 of
 that
 in
 Europe


too.
 So
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 difference


across
 the
 world.
 You
 see
 some
 economic


sluggishness
 in
 parts
 of
 Asia.
 Um
 but


overall
 aggregate
 consumer
 demand
 is


there.
 Uh
 and
 we've
 been
 able
 to
 drive


that
 and
 turn
 that
 into
 a
 good
 result


for
 the
 Coke
 company.


>> Why
 then
 aren't
 we
 seeing
 more
 volumes?


I
 think
 1%
 overall
 volumes
 uh
 flat
 in
 in


North
 America.
 Why
 not
 the
 kind
 of


volume
 growth
 that
 you
 want
 to
 see?


Uh
 I
 think
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 this
 quarter


yes
 we
 we
 I I
 certainly
 would
 like
 to


see
 more
 volume
 growth
 in
 our
 algorithm


of
 the
 total
 company.
 We
 expect
 to
 see


more
 of
 the
 volume
 growth
 come
 from
 more


of
 the
 emerging
 markets
 and
 what
 we
 saw


in
 the
 third
 quarter
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 similar


trend
 uh
 to
 the
 year
 is
 some
 pressure
 in


some
 of
 the
 key
 emerging
 markets
 for
 us.


India
 uh
 was
 below
 our
 expectations
 a


lot
 of
 early
 monsoon
 action
 and
 some


local
 local
 dynamics
 there.
 uh
 China


didn't
 come
 in
 as
 strong
 while
 Coke
 grew


uh
 we
 underperformed
 and
 and
 didn't
 get


the
 volume
 growth
 we
 wanted
 uh
 in
 China


and
 also
 some
 of
 the
 Azan
 markets.
 Uh
 so


there
 were
 some
 weaknesses
 in
 our


emerging
 markets
 that
 should
 drive


volume
 growth
 that
 certainly
 have
 driven


volume
 growth
 in
 the
 past
 as
 well
 as


some
 issues
 in
 Mexico.
 So
 I
 think
 those


will
 revert
 themselves.


>> So
 that's
 pretty
 good
 to
 see
 although


there
 are
 some
 issues
 in
 various


countries
 by
 the
 way
 Amazon
 making
 new


highs
 of
 day.
 uh
 the
 Koch
 CEO
 saying


aggregate
 consumer
 demand
 is
 there.
 This


is
 similar
 to
 what
 JP
 Morgan
 said,


similar
 to
 what
 City
 Bank
 said,
 similar


to
 what
 the
 Levi
 CEO
 said
 uh
 three
 weeks


ago
 when
 they
 had
 the
 the
 first
 earnings


of
 of
 the
 cycle
 and
 and
 they
 said,
 "Hey,


people
 are
 buying
 clothes,
 people
 are


buying
 jeans,
 we're
 seeing
 consumer


demand."
 Like
 the
 fact
 that
 pretty
 much


all
 of
 these
 CEOs
 are
 not
 arguing
 with


the
 idea
 of
 um
 of
 consumer
 demand,
 I


think
 it's
 pretty
 damn
 bullish
 to
 see.


Even
 though
 we
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of


conflicting
 data
 around
 consumers
 and


delinquencies,
 but
 if
 the
 earnings
 are


being
 put
 up,
 that
 means
 consumers
 are


continuing
 to
 buy.
 Coca-Cola,
 right?


They're
 up
 3.84%


on
 the
 day.
 Aid,
 are
 you
 still
 buying


SoFi
 before
 earnings?
 I
 really
 wanted


SoFi
 at
 26.50,
 50.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it


gets
 below
 if
 it
 gets
 to
 at least
 like


27
 probably,
 but
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 buy
 at


2860.
 So
 I'll
 sell
 some
 puts
 most
 likely


and
 if
 SoFi
 goes
 to
 the
 moon,
 I'll


collect
 the
 premium.
 If
 it
 doesn't,
 then


I'll
 get
 SoFi
 at
 a
 better
 price.
 But
 it


kind
 of
 just
 ran
 away
 from
 me
 last
 week.


So
 it
 might
 not
 be
 easy
 to
 get
 back
 into


this
 one.
 S&P
 671
 about
 to
 go
 green
 on


the
 day.
 Nvidia
 back
 up
 from
 179
 to

than
 Tesla


still
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 The
 thing
 about


Amazon
 and
 I
 was
 saying
 this
 yesterday


on
 the
 market
 close.
 I
 I
 do
 want
 to


caution
 people
 here.
 If
 they
 do
 not
 show


AWS
 acceleration,
 I
 can
 see
 the
 stock


going
 below
 200
 pretty
 easily.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 stay
 there
 for
 a


while,
 but
 the
 market
 is
 always
 I
 mean,


if
 you
 remember
 two
 quarters
 ago,
 Amazon


went
 from
 200
 to
 185
 back
 to
 200
 within


three
 days
 because
 you
 know
 AWS
 was


17.2%
 and
 17
 instead
 of
 17.5%.
 like
 the


market
 is
 so
 volatile
 when
 it
 comes
 to


cloud
 growth
 because
 they
 think
 that


Amazon
 is
 losing
 share
 to
 Google
 and


Microsoft
 which
 to
 an
 extent
 in
 certain


areas
 they
 are
 because
 those
 companies


are
 growing
 like
 crazy
 but
 it's
 also


Amazon
 that
 has
 done
 this
 since
 2006
 and


so
 the
 base
 that
 they're
 growing
 off
 is


much
 greater
 I
 mean
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this


chart
 right
 here
 76
 million
 websites


are
 hosted
 on
 Amazon's
 infrastructure


this
 is
 why
 yesterday
 when
 one
 of
 their


largest
 servers
 in
 the
 northeast
 goes


down
 the
 entire
 world
 feels
 the
 pain.


Coinbase,
 Snapchat,
 Robin,
 I
 mean
 all


those
 companies
 just
 get
 like
 nuked
 if


this
 plays
 out.
 But
 76
 million
 websites


running
 on
 this
 infrastructure
 is
 not
 a


joke
 and
 it
 proves
 Amazon's
 moat.
 So


look,
 if
 AWS
 growth
 is
 bad,
 I
 think
 the


stock
 tanks.
 If
 AWS
 growth
 is
 even


somewhat
 reasonable
 or
 better
 than


expected,
 I
 think
 it
 gets
 potentially


rerated.
 not
 like
 a
 Google
 rerating,
 but


it
 at least
 gets
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it


might
 not
 be
 as
 ugly
 as
 before.
 Here
 was


a
 journalist
 who's
 in
 the
 tech
 space,


and
 this
 is
 not
 confirmed
 yet,
 but
 they


put
 this
 out
 yesterday.
 Anthropic
 spent


2.6
 billion
 on
 AWS
 in
 the
 first
 three


quarters
 of
 2025,
 around
 100%
 of
 their


estimated
 revenue.
 Its
 costs
 appear
 to


increase
 with
 their
 revenue,
 showing


little
 path
 to
 profitability.
 So,
 the


the
 punchline
 of
 the
 article
 is
 that


Anthropic
 is
 not
 making
 any
 money,


similar
 to
 OpenAI.
 However,
 the
 fact


that
 they're
 spending
 almost
 100%
 of


their
 revenues
 on
 AWS
 in
 particular


goes
 to
 show
 the
 growth
 that
 Amazon
 is


getting
 from
 these
 AI
 workloads
 and
 you


know
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 2.6


billion
 from
 every
 single
 client
 that


they
 have.
 But
 if
 AI
 workloads
 in


general
 are
 increasing
 on
 AWS,
 you


should
 see
 a
 potential
 increase
 in


guidance
 for
 Q4
 even
 if
 it's
 by.3%


that
 can
 get
 the
 street
 to
 think
 okay


the
 story
 is
 reacelerating.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 would
 make
 the
 story


more
 exciting.
 Bitcoin,
 are
 we
 moving?


Bitcoin
 110.
 Okay,
 that's
 a
 nice
 $1,100


candle
 from
 108
 to
 110.


Ethereum
 3942.


That's
 waking
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 3750.


Bit
 mine
 5331.
 That's
 starting
 to
 go
 a


bit
 more
 green.


And
 Micro
 Strategy
 also
 starting
 to
 go
 a


bit
 more
 green
 as
 well.
 297.5


is
 what
 you
 have
 there.


Amazon's
 about
 to
 be
 up
 1%
 year
 to
 date.


There
 you
 go.
 The
 fact,
 dude,
 the
 fact


that
 half
 the
 world
 shut
 down
 yesterday


and
 the
 stock
 is
 up
 1%.
 It
 just
 goes
 to


show
 how
 important
 valuations
 and


narratives
 are
 in
 a
 market
 because
 you


could
 have
 something
 that
 is
 so


important
 like
 an
 Amazon.
 I
 mean,


literally
 thousands
 and
 thousands
 of


businesses
 across
 the
 country
 could
 not


operate.
 I
 mean,
 think
 about
 how
 much


money
 Robin
 Hood
 and
 Coinbase
 lost


yesterday
 because
 people
 couldn't
 trade


for
 like
 I
 think
 it
 was
 almost
 for
 seven


hours.
 My
 I
 didn't
 get
 my
 Robin
 Hood


back
 until
 3
 PM
 in
 the
 night
 or
 in
 in


the
 afternoon,
 which
 is
 an
 hour
 away


from
 market
 close.


And
 you
 know,
 Amazon
 is
 barely
 is
 quite


incredible
 to
 see
 how
 the
 market
 thinks


of
 this
 stuff.
 Zeta's
 up
 3.5%
 of
 the


day.
 Zeta
 1915.
 And
 then
 what's
 the


other
 one?
 Um,
 VG,
 this
 one
 was
 below
 8


938.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 I
 know
 it's
 down
 from


the
 15s
 because
 of
 that
 BP
 case,
 but
 at


least
 that
 one's
 making
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 move
 in
 the
 next
 decade.


Still
 down
 1%
 of
 the
 day.


My
 brother
 works
 for
 Amazon.
 He
 said


they
 lost
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 yesterday.


Expect
 to
 see
 that
 in
 Q4
 earnings.
 Well,


that's
 the
 other
 thing,
 and
 I'm
 happy


you
 bring
 that
 up.
 Uh,
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 give
 some
 vouchers
 to
 some
 of


these
 companies.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 going


to
 have
 to
 give
 some
 service
 credits.


Wow.
 Amazon
 222
 new
 high
 of
 day
 to
 a


Robin
 Hood
 or
 a
 Snapchat
 or
 a
 Coinbase.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't know
 if
 it's
 going to
 be


tens
 of
 millions
 or
 hundreds
 of


thousands,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to


give
 something
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 sorry.


Please
 don't
 leave
 us."
 Just
 like


CrowdStrike
 did.
 And
 that
 could
 be
 a


one-time
 hit
 for
 their
 Q4
 margins,


which
 again,
 if
 they
 guide
 in
 a
 negative


way,
 that
 could
 get
 the
 street
 to
 also


be
 upset.
 And
 so
 I
 really
 think
 Amazon's


either
 going to
 be
 a
 hit
 or
 miss
 going


into
 earnings,
 but
 I
 think
 long
 term


it's
 freaking
 Amazon
 and
 it's
 an
 easy


stock
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 on.


But
 those
 are
 the
 dynamics
 going
 into
 Q4


that
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 look
 up.


Um


3M
 is
 moving.
 That's
 correct.
 3M
 they


had
 a
 good
 earnings
 as
 well


with
 the
 EU
 Freudian
 slip
 saying
 3
 PM


etc.
 is
 the
 night.
 Dude,
 I'm
 I'm
 excited


to
 uh
 to
 visit
 Europe
 next
 year.
 EM


right
 or
 3M
 right
 there
 up
 4%.


Definitely
 excited
 to
 hopefully
 have


some
 meetups
 and


see
 everyone
 in
 the
 region.
 Dualingo


319.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 draft


today.
 What
 do
 we
 have
 there?
 Matt
 is


still
 definitively
 in
 the
 lead,
 48%.


Uh
 Tanner's
 at
 20,
 Steve's
 at
 eight,
 I'm


at
 36,
 and
 Chris
 is
 at
 10.
 So,
 Matt


Money,
 AS,
 and
 Rocket
 Lab
 continuing


to
 bring
 in
 some
 more
 momentum.
 Weeble


actually
 recovered
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 yesterday
 at
 1190,
 back
 down
 to


1130.


Weeble
 was
 $80
 at
 one
 point
 last
 year.


So,
 I
 mean,
 this
 was
 another
 one
 of


those
 names
 that
 had
 a
 massive
 run
 up


for
 no
 reason
 and
 then
 came
 back
 down
 to


reality
 and
 it
 has
 barely
 gotten
 above


15
 ever
 since
 it
 lost
 80.
 And
 this
 is


some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 can
 happen
 to


these
 names
 that
 are
 running
 like
 crazy


for
 no
 reason.
 Like
 how
 like
 dude,
 how


eagm
 Imagine
 buying
 Weeble
 at
 forget
 80,


at
 50,
 at
 40,
 at
 60,
 at
 70.
 Like
 you're


not
 getting
 back
 to
 those
 levels
 anytime


soon.
 You're
 you're
 you're
 done.
 You
 got


to
 take
 the
 loss
 on
 that.
 And
 if
 that's


what
 happens
 in
 some
 of
 the
 names
 that


have
 been
 running,
 it's
 just
 going
 to


create
 a
 different
 dynamic
 in
 terms
 of


how
 people
 think
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 those


names.
 Lyft.
 Lyft
 is
 green.
 Lyft
 is
 up


about
 2%.


Lyft
 is
 up
 about
 2%


on
 the
 day.
 Uber
 as
 well
 slightly
 flat


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 that's
 the
 other
 worst
 thing
 as
 as


people
 are
 saying
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat.
 I
 mean,
 imagine
 if
 you
 were
 on


margin
 and
 you
 were
 on
 some
 of
 these


names
 buying
 them
 at
 at
 their
 highs.


Like
 then
 not
 only
 are
 you
 down
 on
 the


stock,
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 back
 the
 money.


And
 now
 you
 got
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 get


the
 money
 to
 pay
 back
 the
 margin.


And
 we
 know
 that,
 dude,
 we
 know
 Verizon


right
 there,
 1.2%.
 Chris
 and
 Steve
 had
 a


great
 episode
 on
 Verizon
 yesterday.
 I


actually
 watched
 it
 last
 night
 on


Steve's
 podcast.
 So
 definitely
 would


recommend
 people
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 a


yield
 play
 going
 into
 2026
 to
 listen
 to


it.
 But
 like
 we
 know
 there's
 a
 record


level
 of
 margin
 debt
 out
 there.
 There's


1.13
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 margin
 debt.


It's
 the
 most
 in
 history.
 Are
 we
 sure


that
 there's
 not
 people
 out
 there
 that


have
 used
 margin
 to
 buy
 some
 of
 these


names
 that
 have
 done
 nothing
 in
 terms
 of


earnings
 growth,
 but
 have
 done


everything
 in
 terms
 of
 pumping
 their


narrative
 over
 the
 past
 six
 months?
 Like


I'm
 sure
 there's
 some
 people
 who
 bought


some
 of
 these
 speculative
 names
 on


margin
 and
 if
 they
 bought
 them
 at
 the


top,
 which
 is
 when
 most
 people
 buy


because
 that's
 when
 FOMO
 is
 the
 highest.


If
 those
 names
 don't
 come
 back,
 that


margin's
 done.


And
 again,
 I
 think
 that's
 just
 fraud


that
 has
 to


has
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 system.
 Take
 a


look
 at
 this
 chart
 right
 here.
 We
 looked


at
 this
 yesterday
 in
 the
 market
 close,


but
 look
 at
 gold
 inflows.
 Gold
 down
 4%


on
 the
 day,
 but
 34
 billion,
 not
 in
 the


past
 year,
 in
 the
 past
 10
 weeks,
 3.4


billion
 a
 week
 is
 coming
 into
 gold
 and


silver
 or
 gold
 ETFs.
 And
 then
 gold
 and


silver
 together,
 7.5
 billion
 over
 the


past
 four
 weeks.


By
 the
 way,
 when
 I
 was
 on
 the
 path


yesterday
 coming
 back
 from
 New
 York
 City


back
 to
 New
 Jersey,
 you
 know,
 the
 number


one
 advertiser
 in
 the
 in
 the
 train
 that


was
 like
 it
 was
 plastered
 all
 over
 the


walls.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 could
 not
 look


anywhere
 on
 the
 path


uh
 which
 is
 like
 for
 those
 that
 aren't


part
 of
 the
 the
 tri-state
 area.
 It's


basically
 like
 this
 train
 that
 connects


New
 Jersey
 and
 New
 York
 together.
 The


number
 one
 advertiser
 was
 Mumu.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "What
 is
 this
 Chinese


brokerage
 doing
 advertising
 all
 across


this
 New
 York
 City
 train?
 It's
 like
 just


like
 it
 was
 literally
 hundreds
 because


it's
 a
 really
 long
 train.
 Like
 you
 know


how
 different
 advertisers
 pay
 for


different
 ad
 spots.
 They
 must
 have
 paid


for
 the
 entire
 train."


And
 I
 was
 like
 this
 like
 you
 know
 it's


not
 Robin
 Hood,
 not
 Coinbase,
 it's


freaking
 mumu.


And
 so
 I
 was
 surprised.
 I
 was
 like,
 the


fact
 that
 these
 Chinese
 brokerages
 are


trying
 to
 get
 these
 many
 users
 with
 this


type
 of
 brand
 advertising
 is
 quite


incredible.
 But
 this
 is
 what
 you
 would


see
 in
 a
 bull
 market,
 right?
 People
 want


to
 invest.
 So,
 you
 would
 see
 that
 more


people
 are
 willing
 to
 advertise
 to
 to


get
 those
 investors.


Yeah,
 Mumu
 is
 huge
 in
 Asia
 100%.
 I
 just,


you
 know,
 it
 it's
 doesn't
 have
 the
 type


of
 American
 presence
 that
 it
 has
 in


Asia,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 going


after
 that
 American
 presence
 to
 me
 was


incredible.


Yeah,
 they're
 all
 on
 YouTube.
 They


sponsor
 a
 bunch
 of
 you.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


they've
 reached
 out
 to
 me
 like
 50
 times.


I'm
 just
 But
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 really
 like
 doing
 the


sponsorships.
 But
 it
 it
 it
 is
 it
 is


quite
 incredible
 the
 amount


of
 attention
 these
 brokerages
 are
 trying


to
 generate
 because
 they
 know
 that
 this


is
 a
 bull
 market.
 This
 is
 the
 time
 where


you
 get
 people
 to
 get
 onto
 these


platforms.
 Apple
 right
 here
 up
 half
 a


percent
 on
 the
 day.
 PayPal
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 Then
 Salesforce
 now
 breaking


out
 a
 little
 bit,
 2.39%
 as
 well
 on
 the


day.
 Yes,
 Mumu
 was
 not
 affected


yesterday.
 And
 if
 you
 use
 them
 as
 your


brokerage,
 you
 didn't
 have
 that
 much
 of


an
 issue


with
 uh
 with
 AWS.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 some
 of
 the
 other


headlines
 we
 have.
 Is
 Nebus
 recovering
 a


little bit?
 Nebas
 was
 at
 104.
 Nebas
 to


106.
 All right.
 Nice
 little
 Vshape
 on


Nebus.
 So,
 you're
 not
 seeing
 a
 ton
 of


pain
 right
 there.
 Again,
 I
 I
 I
 hate
 to


bring
 it
 up,
 but
 you're
 you're
 not


really
 seeing
 that
 same
 Vshape
 on
 an


Oaklow.


Still
 down
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 So
 again,
 like


a
 Nebia
 should
 have
 a
 Vshape
 because
 a


Nebia
 is
 a
 very
 high
 quality
 company.
 It


doesn't
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 140,
 but
 it


probably,
 you
 know,
 when
 the
 market


starts
 to
 algorithmically
 bottom
 during


the
 intraday
 at
 102
 to
 105,
 it's
 nice
 to


see
 that
 some
 of
 these
 other
 names
 are


not
 getting
 that
 V.
 They're
 staying


stuck.
 or
 if
 they're
 getting
 a
 V,
 it's
 a


very
 slight
 V,
 which
 means
 there's
 not


really
 any
 momentum
 to
 bring
 them
 back


to
 their
 intraday
 highs.
 And
 that's
 how


you
 know
 some
 of
 this
 momentum
 is
 really


starting
 to
 fade
 out.
 Salesforce
 right


there,
 260.
 And
 then
 Meta


up
 15%


on
 the
 day.
 Air
 Test
 Systems,
 this
 is
 a


stock
 that
 Roy
 really
 likes.
 Uh,
 this
 is


down
 8%.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 why
 this
 one's


down.
 He
 did
 do
 a
 video
 on
 this
 on
 his


channel
 for
 those
 that
 are
 interested.


He
 thinks
 it's
 going to
 be
 a
 really


important
 player
 in
 the
 semiconductor


ecosystem.
 that
 stock
 up
 60%


year
 to
 date
 as
 well.


60%


year
 to
 date.


Um


I
 want
 Nebus
 to
 go
 to
 60.
 That's
 why
 I


sold
 it.
 See,
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 get


that
 opportunity
 like
 because
 that
 would


be
 discounting
 pretty
 much
 the
 entirety


of
 the
 Microsoft
 deal.
 And
 that's
 where


you
 have
 to
 be
 more
 reasonable
 and
 be


like,
 "Yeah,
 look,
 it's
 probably
 not


going
 back
 to
 60."
 I
 mean,
 if
 that


happens,
 you're
 probably
 having
 a


broader
 macro
 collapse,


but
 it
 also
 doesn't
 need
 to
 stay
 stuck


at
 140,
 right?
 Like
 that
 that's
 more


euphoria.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Hood
 at
 150.


That's
 more
 euphoria.


And,
 you
 know,
 coming
 back
 down
 because


because
 it
 was
 at
 it
 was
 at
 what
 65
 or


55
 right
 before
 the
 Microsoft
 deal.
 I


was
 live
 with
 with with
 uh
 Sam
 when
 that


deal
 came
 out
 and
 and and
 couch
 investor


and
 uh
 Jose
 and
 we
 saw
 it
 go
 from
 either


50
 or
 60
 all
 the
 way up
 to
 103


and
 then
 you
 know
 it
 took
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 breather
 came
 back
 down
 to
 85
 and


then
 over
 the
 next
 month
 it
 went
 up
 to


140


but
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 goes
 back
 down
 to


where
 it
 was
 before
 that
 that
 Microsoft


deal.


Steve's
 milk
 brand
 is
 Mumu.
 Dude,
 Mumu


should
 sponsor
 Steve.
 Literally
 milk,


cows,


mooing.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 synergy
 in
 that,


that
 is
 what
 needs
 to
 happen.


That
 is
 what
 has
 to
 happen.
 He
 needs
 to


get
 a
 mumu
 deal
 ASAP


for
 his
 channel.


Microsoft
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Speaker


Johnson
 is
 still
 live.
 This
 guy's
 been


live
 for
 like
 an
 hour,
 bro.


He's
 just
 live
 for
 an
 hour


talking
 about
 the
 Democrats.


I'm
 curious
 when
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 any


resemblance
 of
 a
 negotiation.
 I
 mean,


Trump
 on
 Sunday
 did
 say
 they're
 getting


closer
 to
 something.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


Trump
 meant
 by
 that,
 but
 he
 did
 say


we're
 having
 better
 conversations.


It's
 just
 it
 seems
 like
 publicly
 those


conversations
 are
 just


blaming
 each
 other
 back
 and
 forth.
 Uh,


we
 got
 Mike
 Wilson
 on.
 Let's
 see
 what
 he


has
 to
 say.
 Mike
 Wilson's
 been
 pretty


bullish
 over
 the
 past
 year.
 Let's
 get


his
 thoughts
 on
 how
 the
 Fed
 should
 be


operating
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


>> in
 layoffs.
 And
 there
 was
 a
 a
 low
 in
 all


the
 jobs
 creation,
 which
 the
 revisions


now
 are
 proving.
 And
 the
 stock
 market


figured
 this
 out.
 The
 stock
 market
 is


smarter
 than
 all
 of
 us.
 And
 and
 and
 the


confirmation
 for
 us
 is
 that
 the
 earnings


revisions
 now
 have
 really
 exploded


higher
 in
 a
 way
 they
 only
 do
 in
 a
 new


economic
 cycle.


>> That
 that's
 what
 I
 think
 is
 so


interesting.
 David
 Solomon
 was
 here
 just


a
 little
 bit
 ago
 and
 he
 called
 this
 late


cycle.
 You
 think
 we're
 still
 early


cycle?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we
 just
 transitioned.
 Now,


what
 where
 I
 think
 I
 also
 differ
 have


been
 differing
 is
 that
 these
 cycles


aren't
 going
 to
 last
 that
 long,
 right?


We're
 in
 we're
 now
 in
 an
 inflationary


regime.
 It's
 very
 different
 than
 all
 of


our
 careers
 where
 inflation
 was
 coming


down.
 And
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 these


cycles
 can't
 be
 elongated
 the
 way
 that


they
 were
 because
 the
 Fed
 has
 to
 respond


ultimately
 to
 higher
 inflation.
 Think


about
 the
 last
 5
 years.
 two
 years
 on


2020
 2021
 one
 year
 off
 had
 a
 nice


recovery
 in
 23
 24
 then
 we
 had
 another


kind
 of
 capitulation
 recession
 and
 this


>> gold
 officially
 down
 5%
 folks
 gold


officially
 down
 5%
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to


find
 the
 data
 on
 the
 last
 time
 it
 had
 a


5%
 down
 day
 silver
 down
 7.5
 looks
 like


all
 the
 commodities
 are
 taking
 a
 hit


right
 now


>> year
 and
 now
 we're
 into
 a
 new
 two-year


cycle
 so
 you
 just
 got
 to
 keep
 that
 in


the
 back
 of
 your
 mind


>> that
 that's
 not
 that
 different
 than
 what


he
 was
 saying
 then
 he
 what
 David
 Solomon


was
 saying
 we're
 late
 cycle
 this
 could


have
 another
 year
 or
 two
 to
 run.


>> That's
 right.
 But
 it's
 but
 I
 think
 that


context
 is
 important
 to
 distinguish


because
 if
 it's
 late
 cycle
 then
 you
 only


want
 to
 own
 sort
 of
 defensive


highquality
 names
 in
 an
 early
 cycle
 new


recovery.
 The
 market
 will
 expand.
 It


will
 broaden
 out
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


what's
 starting
 to
 happen
 now.
 We
 think


that's
 a
 story
 for
 26.
 It
 looks
 a
 lot


like
 21
 in
 that
 regard.


>> What
 do
 you
 like?


>> Well,
 we
 like
 a
 we
 like
 a
 lot
 we
 like
 a


barbell
 at
 the
 moment
 because
 we
 still


think
 the
 Fed
 needs
 to
 cut
 rates.
 So,


we've
 been
 on
 the
 cyclical
 side.
 We
 have


liked
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 tech
 sector.
 We
 have


liked
 financials.
 We
 have
 like


industrials.
 That's
 the
 the
 pro
 side
 on


the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 cyclical
 side.
 And
 on


the
 defensive
 high
 quality
 side,
 it's,


you
 know,
 it's
 basically
 healthcare


right
 now.
 We
 think
 healthcare
 looks


quite
 interesting.
 Now,
 we
 do
 think
 the


Fed
 will
 get
 with
 the
 program
 and
 they


will
 start
 cutting
 rates
 in
 a
 more


meaningful
 way
 once
 the
 labor
 data


confirms
 what
 we
 all
 know,
 which
 is
 that


the
 labor
 market's
 not
 that
 not
 that


good.
 And
 when
 that
 happens,
 then
 we
 can


really
 transition
 to
 the
 interest
 rate


sensitive
 parts
 of
 the
 market
 that
 have


been
 languishing.
 things
 like
 housing,


things
 like
 consumer
 goods,
 all
 the


durable
 goods,
 the
 the
 areas
 that
 where


there's
 pent-up
 demand.


>> How
 how
 difficult
 is
 it
 to
 not
 have


government
 data
 at
 this
 point?
 Yeah,


because
 you
 sound
 so
 sure
 in
 your


beliefs
 on
 these
 things.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 government
 data
 that


we're
 waiting
 for,
 everybody's,
 you


know,
 waiting
 for
 is
 mostly
 the
 the
 jobs


data,
 but
 that's
 backward-looking.
 I


think
 we've
 already
 confirmed
 that
 the


trough
 was
 in
 in
 April.
 That
 doesn't


mean,
 by
 the
 way,
 we're
 totally
 out
 of


the
 woods.
 But
 what
 it
 means
 is
 that
 I


don't
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 learn
 a
 whole


lot
 from
 this
 data
 that
 we're
 not
 seeing


at
 the
 moment.
 I
 think
 it
 gives
 comfort.


I
 think
 it
 will
 give
 the
 Fed
 the
 cover


to
 do
 what
 I
 think
 they
 need
 to
 do,


which
 is
 cut
 rates
 in
 a
 more
 meaningful


way.
 So
 that's
 to
 me
 that's
 the
 risk
 is


that
 we
 don't
 get
 the
 data
 that
 allows


the
 Fed
 to
 cut
 more
 meaningfully.


>> And
 and
 when
 you
 say
 more
 meaningfully,


you're
 talking
 about
 more
 than
 25
 basis


points
 at
 a
 clip.


>> Exactly.
 I
 let
 me
 just
 put
 it
 in


context.
 So
 the
 Fed
 is
 behind
 the
 curve


in
 my
 view
 until
 they
 get
 ahead
 they
 get


lower
 than
 two-year
 Treasury
 yields.


Okay.
 It's
 about
 75
 85
 basis
 points.
 So


that's
 just
 three
 cuts
 to
 get
 to


neutral.
 to
 get
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve,
 they


probably
 got
 to
 cut
 150
 plus.
 And
 the


only
 way
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 that
 is
 if


we
 get
 weaker
 labor
 data,
 which
 I
 think


is
 probably
 forthcoming,
 or
 we
 get
 some


sort
 of
 bond
 volatility
 or
 financial


stress,
 the
 third
 mandate,
 if
 you
 will.


>> All
 of
 your
 thoughts
 about
 the
 market


continuing
 to
 climb
 from
 here.


What
 would
 happen
 if
 we
 do
 get
 some
 of


that
 bond
 market
 turmoil
 that
 you're


talking
 about
 or
 tensions
 continue
 on


this
 China
 trade
 front?
 Because
 that's


been
 the
 macro
 issue
 that
 has
 made


markets
 wobble
 recently.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 distinguish
 our
 12-month
 view
 is


quite
 constructive
 for
 the
 reasons
 I


just
 laid
 out.
 But
 on
 a
 in
 a
 short-term


basis,
 this
 is
 probably
 the
 first
 time


since
 April
 that
 I
 think
 we
 have
 maybe
 a


tradable
 correction.
 And
 it
 would
 be


those
 three
 things
 you
 mentioned.
 First,


the
 China
 US
 trade
 tensions.
 We're
 kind


of
 walking
 towards
 this,
 you
 know,


deadline.
 The
 markets
 may
 get
 nervous


around
 that.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 it's
 a


correction.
 It's
 not
 like
 we're
 going


back
 to
 where
 we
 were
 in
 April,
 but
 but


you
 know,
 a
 10%
 correction
 would
 feel


pretty
 nasty.
 The
 second
 reason
 would
 be


we
 get
 funding
 market
 stress
 which
 by


the
 way
 the
 chair
 chair
 Powell
 talked


about
 last
 week.
 That's
 one
 of the


reasons
 why
 we
 may,
 you
 know,
 end
 QT
 a


little
 bit
 earlier
 next
 year
 because


we're
 starting
 to
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of


funding
 stress
 which
 is
 essentially
 the


bank
 reserves
 are
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 too


low
 for
 the
 liquidity
 we
 need
 not
 just


for
 the
 financial
 markets
 but
 now
 for


this
 economy
 which
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be


booming
 next
 year.
 So
 those
 are
 two


reasons
 I
 think
 we
 could
 see
 some


corrective
 activity
 in
 the
 near
 term.
 I


don't
 think
 it
 derails
 our
 core
 view
 on


the
 rolling
 recovery.
 It's
 nice
 you
 said


all
 of
 us
 have
 spent
 our
 entire
 careers


in
 a
 low
 inflation
 environment.


>> It
 was
 nice
 that
 you
 one
 exception.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 nice
 that
 you
 threw
 me
 in


there
 and
 and
 ju
 just
 to
 cuz
 it's
 hard


to
 believe
 uh
 inflation
 rate
 right
 when


I
 started
 in
 the
 business
 13
 and
 a


half%.
 inflation
 rate
 13
 and
 a
 half.
 We


you
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 when
 you
 think


about
 things
 being
 bad,
 think
 of
 I
 mean


>> okay
 because
 it
 creates
 earnings
 growth.


It's
 just
 different.


>> Yeah.
 And


>> painful
 for
 everybody
 living
 through
 it


though.


>> Well,
 it's
 painful
 for
 the
 consumer,


right?
 And
 that's
 why
 we
 have
 this


bifurcated
 economy.
 But
 don't
 fear


inflation
 next
 year.
 In
 fact,
 if
 we


don't
 get
 inflation
 next
 year,
 I'll


probably
 get
 more
 bearish
 because
 that


means
 the
 earning
 story
 is
 probably
 not


going
 to
 deliver
 on
 what
 people
 are


expecting.
 H.


>> So,
 Mike
 Wilson
 kind
 of
 making
 a
 very


similar
 argument
 that
 he's
 made.
 By
 the


way,
 S&P
 regaining
 671
 over
 the
 past
 um


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 now,
 which
 is


that
 we
 are
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 new


bull
 market.
 And
 that
 beginning
 of
 a
 new


bull
 market
 is
 uh
 emblematic
 of
 the


earnings
 growth
 that
 we're
 seeing,
 but


also
 of
 the
 massive
 draw
 down.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 tenure
 right
 here
 3.955


still
 below
 four
 of
 the
 April
 draw
 down.


So,
 and
 this
 is
 the
 same
 thing
 Tom
 Lee


says
 that
 once
 you
 have
 this
 massive


April
 30%
 draw
 down,
 stocks
 bottomed
 and


historically
 when
 you
 have
 a
 bottom


after
 a
 30%
 draw
 down,
 you
 tend
 to
 enter


into
 a
 new
 cycle,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy


to
 imagine
 because
 that
 30%
 draw
 down


basically
 happened
 for
 no
 reason
 with


all
 the
 liberation
 tariff
 stuff.
 But
 the


fact
 that
 it
 did
 happen
 is
 something


that
 can't
 be
 ignored.
 And
 if
 that


introduces
 a
 new
 part
 of
 the
 cycle,
 then


it's
 a
 totally
 different
 dynamic
 of
 how


to
 think
 historically
 of
 what
 this
 bull


market
 looks
 like.


But
 you're
 seeing
 that
 in
 some
 of
 the


numbers
 potentially
 based
 on
 the


earnings
 growth
 that
 we
 could
 get.
 671


right
 here
 on
 the
 S&P
 1030.
 Not
 really


getting
 a
 massive
 slam.
 You're
 actually


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 reversal.


Bitcoin


108
 to
 110.
 Nice
 to
 see
 that.
 Ethereum


back
 almost
 to
 40
 or
 to
 4,000.
 And
 then


BMR
 just
 below
 53


but
 still
 holding
 above
 50.


Wow.
 China
 imported
 no
 soybeans
 from
 the


US
 in
 September,
 the
 first
 time
 since


November
 2018.


Bro,
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 just
 joking


about
 the
 soybean
 I
 thought
 I


didn't
 think
 they
 were
 serious.


China's
 really
 not
 buying
 our
 soybeans.


I
 thought
 they
 were
 just
 like
 messing


around.
 They
 really
 don't
 want
 our


soybeans.


Damn.


No
 soybeans
 since
 November.
 Remember


2018,
 the
 the
 reason
 the
 rally
 got


messed
 up
 outside
 of
 the
 Fed
 hiking
 was


uh
 the
 the
 soybean
 trade
 war
 drama
 with


China.
 Now,
 given
 Trump's
 deescalation


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days,
 it
 seems


like,
 you
 know,
 he
 literally
 said,
 "I


think
 we'll
 get
 a
 deal
 on
 soybeans
 with


China."
 So,
 he
 is
 confident
 that
 they'll


figure
 something
 out,


but
 it
 looks
 like
 they're
 not
 buying
 it.


It
 looks
 like
 they


are
 not
 buying
 it.
 Yeah,
 this
 is
 why


it's
 Yeah,
 100%.
 This
 is
 why
 it's
 hard


to
 separate
 politics
 from
 the
 stock


market.
 I
 mean,
 when
 when
 there's


implications


of
 these
 political
 events
 within
 stocks


and
 obviously
 within


commodities,
 futures,


goods,
 etc.
 Like,
 it's
 hard
 to
 to
 be


separated
 from
 it.


Triple
 V,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here,
 Mr.


Triple
 V,
 as
 well.
 Appreciate
 you
 being


here
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the
 channel.


Going
 back
 to
 the
 conversation
 we
 were


having
 about
 frothy
 names
 going
 up
 for


no
 reason.
 I
 mean
 TripleV
 who's
 become


uh
 you
 know
 a
 a
 mentor
 of
 mine
 along


with
 Derek.
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 have
 been


part
 of
 this
 cycle
 many
 many many
 times.


They've
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 on
 frothy


names
 but
 they
 both
 I
 mean
 he
 triple
 V


literally
 shorted
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


couple
 million
 shares
 of
 open
 door
 at
 10


bucks
 and
 it
 was
 a
 really
 good
 short.
 I


think
 he
 covered
 like
 830.


So,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 when
 when


you
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 who
 have


seen
 these
 cycles,
 plenty
 of
 you
 guys
 in


the
 chat
 have
 been
 around
 bubble
 2008,


like
 you've
 seen
 these
 cycles
 and
 these


cycles
 when
 these
 names
 run
 up
 for
 no


reason,
 like
 until
 they
 can
 pivot
 the


company.
 And
 Openoro,
 by
 the
 way,
 is


actually
 a
 special
 case
 because
 that
 CEO


I'm
 actually
 pretty
 bullish
 on.
 And
 if


they
 can
 somehow
 pivot
 the
 company
 to


produce
 like
 earnings,
 that
 stock
 does


not
 have
 to
 go
 to
 zero
 by
 any
 sense
 of


the
 imagination.


But,
 you
 know,
 Triple
 V,
 Derek,
 they've


been
 in
 these
 cycles
 where
 these
 names


go
 up
 like
 crazy.
 They've
 lost
 money
 on


some
 of
 these
 names
 before.
 They've
 also


made
 money
 by
 recognizing,
 hey,
 you
 just


don't
 need
 to
 get
 into
 these
 names


because
 these
 names
 are
 likely
 a
 fat
 of


the
 moment
 that
 until
 they
 put
 up
 growth


are
 going
 to
 come
 and
 go,


like
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 that
 are
 out
 there.


Thoughts
 on
 UNH
 gapping
 up?
 Uh,
 look,
 I


like
 UNH
 here.
 They
 revised
 their


guidance,
 I
 think,
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 That's


why
 they
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 price
 target


upgrades
 and
 that's
 why
 the
 street
 was


excited
 about
 them.
 Um,
 I
 think
 there


still
 are
 better
 opportunities
 in
 some


of
 these
 AI
 names,
 but
 UNH
 is
 more
 so


you
 can
 sleep
 well
 at
 night
 without


having
 to
 worry
 too
 much
 even
 if
 you


don't
 get
 massive
 growth.
 So,
 I
 don't


hate
 UNH
 here.
 It
 has
 made
 a
 pretty
 big


move
 since
 the
 230
 run.
 Also,
 dude,
 we


got
 to
 see
 when
 these
 13Gs
 come
 out
 in


November
 on
 if
 um


if
 uh
 I
 if
 the
 big
 guys
 sold
 UNH.
 So


Buffett,
 Ter,
 Bur,
 all
 these
 guys
 own
 a


ton
 of
 UNH.
 I
 wonder
 did
 they
 sell
 after


the
 pump
 from
 230
 to
 370.
 Now
 my
 gut


says
 no
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 guys


bought
 in
 around
 350.
 And
 I
 don't
 know


how
 many
 of
 them
 double
 down
 in
 the
 lows


of
 230,
 240,
 250.
 But
 if
 they
 didn't,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 sell
 for
 break


even.
 They're
 probably
 expecting
 a
 $500


stock
 at least
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years
 to


to
 to
 make
 some
 profits
 on.
 But
 if
 they


did
 sell,
 then
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 they


made
 some
 quick
 money
 and
 left.
 And
 so
 I


am
 curious
 when
 those
 13Gs
 come
 out.


They
 should
 be
 out
 in
 like
 three
 weeks.


It
 shouldn't
 be
 too
 long
 until
 we
 see


the
 new
 13Gs


on
 what
 happened
 with
 UNH.
 Yeah,
 Bur


probably
 sold.
 Buffett
 most
 likely
 held


on
 to
 it.
 Ter
 tends
 to
 hold
 on
 for
 at


least
 a
 year.
 So
 I
 feel
 like
 Ter


probably
 held
 on.


Bur
 is
 probably
 out
 of
 it
 though.


Amit,
 would
 you
 go
 long?
 Ethereum's


Black
 Rockck
 Fund
 or
 just
 BMR.
 It


depends
 on
 the
 leverage
 you
 want.
 Uh
 the


Ethereum
 ETF
 is
 fine
 if
 you
 want
 a


onetoone
 proportional
 move
 with


Ethereum.
 The
 other
 reason
 why
 people


like
 BMR,
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 wrote
 in
 my


Substack,
 um
 are
 the
 call
 premiums,


right?
 Like
 if
 you
 buy
 it
 at
 52
 and
 this


thing
 stays
 stuck
 between
 52
 and
 60,


you're
 going
 to
 significantly
 reduce


your
 cost
 bases
 by
 even
 selling,
 you


know,
 0.2
 deltas
 on
 this
 every
 week.
 And


so
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 people
 like


Bitmine
 is
 because
 they
 can
 artificially


decrease
 their
 cost
 bases
 with
 the
 call


premiums.
 And
 if
 Ethereum
 is
 rangebound


between
 3500
 and
 let's
 call
 it
 5,000,


then
 Bitmine's
 not
 going
 to
 the
 moon,


right?
 Bit
 mine's
 going
 to
 stay
 stuck


within
 a
 1.4x
 premium
 above
 that
 net


asset
 value.


So
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 another
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 why
 people
 like
 it.
 Now,
 the


Ethereum
 ETF
 on
 Black
 Rockck
 also
 has


some
 good
 premiums,
 but
 the
 Bitmine


premiums
 are
 just
 a
 totally
 different


level.


Uh,
 Amit,
 did
 you
 sell
 calls
 on
 Nebius?


No,
 I
 sold
 puts
 on
 Nebus.
 So,
 no
 calls


on
 Nebus,
 just
 puts.
 I'll
 just
 say
 it


right
 now
 because,
 you
 know,
 people
 are


probably
 wondering
 why
 I
 sold
 puts
 on


it.
 I'm
 doing
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 Nebas.


Doing
 a
 deep
 dive
 on
 Nebus.
 So,
 that
 as


I've
 started
 to
 do
 my
 research,
 I'm


like,
 okay,
 there's
 something
 there's


something
 here.
 Obviously,
 I
 missed
 this


stock
 the
 whole
 year.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of the


Nebus
 bulls
 know
 that
 this
 is
 a
 very


special
 name.
 I
 have
 not
 concluded
 if


it's
 worth
 taking
 a
 a
 real
 position
 in,


but
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 my
 deep
 dive,


I'm
 like,
 you
 know
 what,
 if
 I
 have
 to


own
 it
 at
 98,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that


upset
 about
 it.
 So,
 that's
 why I
 sold


some
 puts
 at
 98,


but
 there
 will
 be
 a
 deep
 dive
 on


Nebulius
 coming
 up
 pretty
 soon.


And
 I
 am
 enjoying
 learning
 a
 lot
 more


about
 the
 company.


I
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 buy,
 dude.
 I
 It's


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


bagghold
 anything.
 Like
 I
 don't
 want
 to


freaking
 bagghold
 a
 name
 that
 I'm
 not


fully
 convicted
 in
 like
 grab
 I
 can
 buy


bag
 hold
 because
 my
 conviction
 is
 set


and
 like
 it's
 not
 the
 company
 would
 have


to
 really
 mess
 up
 for
 me
 to
 lose
 my


conviction
 and
 so
 it's
 easy
 to
 bag
 but
 I


don't
 want
 to
 bagold
 apploven
 it.
 I


don't
 know
 anything
 about
 apploving
 even


though
 it
 does
 feel
 like
 it's
 a
 deep


value
 opportunity
 right
 here
 but
 I'm


definitely
 not
 going
 to
 take
 the
 risk


and
 hold
 it
 in
 case
 I'm
 wrong.


Same
 thing
 on
 an
 ebius.
 You
 know,
 as


much
 as
 I
 love
 it,
 like
 if
 I
 end
 up
 if


this
 thing
 ends
 up
 going
 back
 down
 to
 90


and
 I
 buy
 a
 106,
 it's
 it's
 not
 fun
 to
 be


bag
 holding
 16
 bucks
 when
 I
 could
 have


just
 been
 a
 bit
 more
 patient.


I
 definitely
 don't
 want
 to
 bag
 hold.


Definitely
 don't
 want
 to
 bag
 hold.
 Wow,


gold
 down
 the
 worst
 it's
 been
 today.
 Low


of
 days
 5.44%.


4106.


Goodness
 gracious.
 Silver
 down
 7.6.


This
 one's
 ugly,
 bro.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


really
 curious
 to
 see
 if
 gold
 can
 get
 a


rebound.
 Who
 do
 you
 think's
 selling


today?
 By
 the
 way,
 Philip
 Morris
 down


10%.
 Do
 they
 have
 earnings?
 I
 think


Philip
 Morris
 might
 have
 had
 earnings


and
 maybe
 weren't
 the
 best
 earnings.
 Uh,


who
 do
 you
 think
 selling?
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 central
 banks?
 Do
 you
 think
 it's


retail?
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 institutions?


Like,
 who's
 actually
 taking
 profits
 on


gold
 today?


that
 would
 be
 causing
 that
 much
 of
 a


decline.


I
 mean
 5%


hold
 on
 that
 means
 gold
 has
 lost
 in


terms
 of
 market
 cap
 um


if
 I'm
 not
 wrong
 gold
 has
 lost
 1.5


trillion
 in
 market
 cap
 on
 that
 5%.


Yeah,
 I
 believe
 that's
 1.5
 trillion.


So
 that's
 a


yeah
 1.5
 trillion
 or
 1.3.


It
 was
 at
 30.
 Now
 it's
 at
 around
 28.8.


That's
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 leaving
 gold,


bro.
 That's
 why
 a
 5%
 move
 is
 a
 big
 move.


That's
 why
 a
 70%
 move
 is
 also
 a
 big
 move


this
 year
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's


been
 able
 to
 explain.


But
 a
 5%
 draw
 down
 also
 takes
 a
 big
 hit.


Okay.
 Okay,
 Philip
 Morris
 did
 have


earnings
 today,
 folks.
 This
 is
 why
 we


hired
 Cactus
 Jack.
 This
 for
 those
 that


don't
 know,
 he
 has
 joined
 AK
 Media


full-time.
 This
 is
 why
 we
 have
 our
 own


Bloomberg
 terminal.
 There
 you
 go.
 Philip


Morris.
 Okay,
 so
 earnings
 EPS
 224
 from


191.
 That's
 a
 beat.
 Revenue
 10.8
 versus


9.9.
 That's
 a
 beat.
 Revenues
 up
 9%


year-over-year.
 EPS


17%
 year-over-year.
 And
 they
 raised


guidance.
 Why
 is
 the
 stock
 down
 10%
 on
 a


double
 beat
 and
 a
 raise
 of
 guidance?


That
 is
 weird.
 These
 guys
 sell


cigarettes,
 right?
 Yeah,
 they
 sell


cigarettes.


Okay,
 so
 they're
 guiding
 for
 more
 people


smoking
 and
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.


This
 is
 a
 $220
 billion
 company.


Bro,
 I
 didn't
 think
 Philip
 Morris
 was


that
 big.
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 like
 a
 $70


billion
 $220
 billion
 company.


Oh,
 yeah.
 And
 Zen
 Zen,
 that
 that
 that's


their
 main
 thing,
 right?
 Zen.
 Yeah.


I've
 still
 never
 taken
 Zen
 before.
 Yo,


put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 take
 Zen.
 Put
 in


the
 chat
 if
 you
 take
 Zin
 because
 I
 know


it's
 getting
 popular
 with
 the
 youth.
 I


can
 say
 that
 now
 because
 I'm
 28.
 So,
 I


know
 the
 kids
 these
 days
 are
 uh
 are


popping
 Zin.
 You
 know,
 in
 my
 day,
 we


used
 to
 pop
 Molly,
 but
 I
 guess
 the
 kids


want
 to
 do
 Zen
 these
 days.
 Do
 you
 do


Zen?
 Yes
 or
 no?
 Put
 a
 poll
 in
 the
 chat.


Just
 kidding.
 I've
 never
 done
 Molly.


too
 much
 of
 a
 to
 do.
 Too
 much
 too


much
 of
 a
 scaredy-cat
 to
 do
 something


like
 that.
 Um,


but
 Zen
 is
 like
 nicotine,
 but
 you
 like


put
 it
 in
 your
 in
 your
 gums.
 It's
 the


weirdest
 thing
 ever,
 bro.
 You
 like
 It's


like
 a
 pouch
 of
 nicotine
 and
 you
 put
 it


in
 your
 gums
 and
 you
 just
 go
 about
 your


day.
 I've
 never
 understood
 it,


but
 it's
 healthier
 than
 smoking.
 I
 guess


there's
 less
 like
 uh
 there's
 like
 no


tobacco
 in
 it,
 right?
 Because
 it's
 not
 a


cigarette.
 It's
 just
 nicotine.


But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 CEOs
 that
 actually


do
 it
 as
 well.
 It's
 like
 it's
 like
 this


is
 what
 it
 looks
 like.
 This
 thing
 right


here.


There's
 a
 celebrity
 that
 owns
 a
 big


brand
 around
 Zen.
 I
 forgot
 the
 name
 of


it.
 But


why?
 That's
 weird.
 Why
 is
 the
 stock
 down


10%
 on
 those
 results?
 Something
 in
 the


earnings
 they
 must
 have
 said


is
 getting
 the
 street
 to
 not
 be
 that


excited.
 Oh,
 Tucker.
 Tucker
 Carlson.


Yes,
 Tucker.
 That
 guy,
 he
 loves
 his


Zins.


No
 carcinogenics
 is
 the
 big
 deal
 about


it.


Tucker
 owns
 ALP.
 Okay,
 so
 there
 you
 go.


It's
 just
 nicotine
 salt
 in
 a
 nylon


pouch.


Uh
 83%
 of
 you
 say
 no.


Yeah,
 I've
 never
 never
 done
 Zen,
 but
 it


is
 a
 big
 big
 product.
 All right,
 here's


the
 update
 on
 Netflix
 and
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 potentially
 getting
 that


buyout.
 That
 of
 course
 has
 been
 the
 plan


that's
 been
 in
 place
 for
 quite
 some
 time


and
 one
 that
 many
 expected
 they
 might


continue
 to
 pursue
 even
 with
 Paramount's


interest.
 Um
 but
 that
 being
 said,
 citing


what
 is
 interest
 from
 multiple
 parties,


my
 belief
 uh
 my
 reporting
 indicating
 all


those
 parties
 other
 than
 Paramount
 have


been
 interested
 in
 buying
 the
 streaming


and
 studio
 business.
 But
 nonetheless,


citing
 all
 of
 those
 multiple
 parties,


again,
 not
 naming
 those
 parties,
 but


citing
 multiple
 parties,
 the
 company
 has


said
 uh
 that
 it
 will
 initiate
 a
 review


of
 strategic
 alternatives
 to,
 of
 course,


what
 they
 always
 say,
 maximize
 uh
 uh


shareholder
 value.
 And
 so
 that
 process


uh
 will
 begin.
 Now,
 they
 already
 have
 in


hand
 a
 bid
 from
 Paramount.
 Um,
 I


reported
 previously,
 you
 know,
 perhaps
 a


range
 of
 22
 to
 24
 largely
 made
 up
 of


cash.
 Uh,
 at
 some
 point
 I
 expect
 to
 be


able
 to
 sort
 of
 get
 a
 sense
 exactly


where
 Paramount
 ended
 their
 bidding,
 so


to
 speak,
 privately.
 But
 now,
 this
 will


become
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 public
 story,
 if
 you


will.
 You
 can
 take
 a
 look
 at
 Warner


Brothers
 stock
 moving
 up
 a
 bit.
 Remember


where
 it
 came
 from,
 of
 course,
 before


all
 of
 the
 speculation
 began
 with
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 story
 discussing


Paramount's
 interest
 in
 mounting
 a
 bid


for
 the
 company.
 stock
 was
 somewhere


around
 12
 bucks
 a
 share.
 Um,


>> so
 speaking
 of
 content
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 content
 acquisitions,
 uh,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 The
 only
 fan
 CEO
 is
 live


at
 a
 panel
 right
 now.
 Here's
 two
 things


that
 she
 said.
 Uh,


people
 don't
 want
 AI
 generated
 content.


AI
 can't
 replace
 human
 created
 content.


So
 you
 got
 the
 only
 fan
 CEO
 kind
 of


hedging
 back
 against
 a
 lot
 of
 these


arguments
 that
 quite
 literally
 Sam
 Alman


made
 last
 week
 around
 this
 whole
 erotica


element
 of
 chatbt
 that
 the
 best
 form
 of


content
 in
 that
 niche
 is
 going
 to
 be
 not


AI
 generated.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 for


humans.


Now,
 obviously,
 yeah,
 she's
 saying
 that


because
 she
 has
 a
 business
 that
 she


wants
 to
 continue
 running,
 and
 you
 need


uh
 human
 generated
 content
 to
 make
 that


happen.
 But
 I
 wonder,
 dude,
 if
 people


start
 flipping
 to
 AI
 stuff,
 I
 mean,
 what


if
 only
 fans
 kind
 of
 makes
 their
 own
 AI


content?
 I
 mean,
 like,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 ways
 that
 you
 could
 imagine


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 You
 know,
 my


dad,
 I
 was
 with
 my
 dad
 last
 night
 for


Dvali,
 and
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 my
 dad


asked
 me,
 uh,
 because
 he's
 learning
 a


lot
 more
 about
 AI,
 and
 he's
 like
 reading


all
 these
 articles
 about
 it.
 like,
 "Do


you
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 affect
 your


career
 one
 day?"
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,


people
 might
 not
 want
 to
 listen
 to
 a


human
 talk
 about
 the
 stock
 market.
 They


might
 want
 to
 get
 their
 news
 from
 an


AI."
 And
 he
 was
 like, "So,
 so
 what
 what


how
 are
 you
 going to
 hedge
 against?"


He's
 like, "How
 are
 you
 going to
 protect


yourself
 against
 it?"
 I
 was
 like,
 "The


only
 thing
 I
 can
 hope
 is
 that
 more


people
 care
 about
 authentic
 human
 level


creativity
 over
 a
 bot
 that's
 providing


information
 to
 them,
 right?"
 And
 and
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows?
 Maybe
 in


10
 years,
 people
 just
 don't
 care
 about


the
 authentic
 human
 to
 human
 connection


that
 we
 have
 via
 content
 and
 and
 they


they
 like
 getting
 it
 through
 something


that's
 more
 automated.
 But
 it
 is
 a
 risk


for
 every
 single
 industry,
 whether


you're
 in
 content
 or
 bluecollar
 job.


Like
 everyone
 could
 be
 affected
 by
 it.


Bitcoin
 moving
 up,
 Bitcoin
 111,


you're
 getting
 some
 momentum
 right


there.
 All
 right,
 Bitcoin,
 that's
 a


that's
 a
 pretty
 that's
 a
 $2,500
 candle


in
 the
 past
 20
 minutes.
 So,
 nice
 to
 see


Bitcoin
 making
 a
 little
 bit
 move.


Ethereum
 still
 lagging
 just
 below
 4,000.


Can
 AI
 mispronounce
 words
 as
 badly
 as


you
 admit?
 See,
 that's
 not
 going
 to


happen.
 And
 that's
 why
 that's
 why
 I


might
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 my
 job.


I
 told
 him,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Dad,
 I
 I
 think


hopefully
 the
 the
 the
 you
 know,
 the


level
 of


creative,
 authentic
 connections
 that
 you


build
 in
 in
 this
 type
 of
 industry,
 which


is
 media,
 are
 enough
 to
 sustain
 the
 the


the
 the
 threat
 of
 AI.
 But
 no
 one's
 safe.


No
 one
 is
 freaking
 safe.


And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it
 comes
 down


to
 just
 how
 much
 are
 people
 going
 to
 be


using
 this
 for
 every
 single
 part
 of


their
 life
 over
 the
 coming
 decades.


Uh
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 again,
 111


starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 juice


right
 here.
 Bitcoin's
 been
 doing
 that


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 It
 it
 goes


up
 around
 this
 time,
 11,
 then
 by
 2
 p.m.


it
 comes
 down,
 then
 by
 5:00
 p.m.
 it


comes
 back
 up.
 This
 will
 be
 the
 first


October
 if
 Bitcoin
 doesn't
 make
 a
 move


where
 BTC
 will
 be
 down
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 10
 years.
 October
 would
 not
 be


happening
 if
 Bitcoin
 does
 not
 get
 to
 at


least


they
 have
 to
 get
 to
 at
 least
 115.


Bitcoin
 needs
 to
 get
 to
 115
 by
 October


31st
 for
 it
 to
 not
 which
 I
 mean
 it's


4,000
 away
 which
 is
 not
 that
 crazy


but
 it
 has
 to
 hold
 above
 that
 by
 the
 end


of
 October
 for
 it
 to
 still
 be
 a
 green


October


for
 Bitcoin.
 No,
 now
 hey
 here
 here's


here's
 something
 that
 I
 just
 thought
 of


which
 some
 of you
 guys
 are
 probably
 have


been
 thinking
 about
 for
 the
 past
 hour.


Maybe
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 up
 because
 gold


is
 going
 down.


Maybe
 Bitcoin's
 going
 up
 because
 gold
 is


going
 down.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't know
 if
 everyone
 selling


their
 gold
 is
 getting
 into
 Bitcoin,
 but


maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 people
 that


are
 taking
 profits
 on
 gold
 are
 coming


over
 to
 digital
 gold.
 Maybe
 that's
 the


trend
 for
 the
 next
 10
 days
 of
 October


that
 we
 get
 our
 October
 or
 or
 October.


Then
 again,
 if
 you're
 selling
 gold,


why
 would
 you
 buy
 digital
 gold?
 Like
 the


people
 that
 are
 in
 gold
 in
 the
 first


place
 probably
 don't
 care
 that
 much


about
 digital
 gold.
 I'm
 sure
 there's


some
 people
 that
 own
 both,
 but
 I'll
 say


the
 far
 majority
 bought
 gold
 instead
 of


Bitcoin
 for
 a
 reason.
 So
 if
 you
 sell
 it,


do
 you
 really
 go
 to
 something
 that's


much
 more
 volatile
 than
 gold?


We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that


rotation
 actually
 becomes
 real.


Um,


call
 Peter
 Schiff.
 Dude,
 Peter
 Schiff


must
 be
 having
 the
 time
 of
 his
 life.


This
 guy
 was
 on
 the
 wrong
 side
 of
 the


gold
 Bitcoin
 trade
 for
 basically
 seven


years.
 Every
 interview
 he
 would
 just
 get


humiliated
 because
 the
 price
 of
 gold
 was


flat
 and
 Bitcoin
 was
 going
 to
 the
 moon.


And
 Bitcoin
 has
 still
 done
 very
 well.


And
 obviously
 he
 would
 have
 made
 a
 lot


of
 money
 if
 he
 picked
 Bitcoin
 over
 gold.


But
 he
 must
 feel
 like
 a
 legend
 for


Bitcoin
 doubling
 over
 the
 past
 two


years.


And
 he's
 been
 talking
 about
 it
 for
 a


long
 time.


It's
 just
 during
 the
 time
 that
 he
 was


talking
 about
 it,
 if
 he
 talked
 about


Bitcoin
 or
 if
 he
 made
 an
 investment
 in


Bitcoin,
 he
 would
 be
 up
 like
 10x,


which
 would
 be
 different.


Um,


yeah,
 Bitcoin,
 Salana,
 Ethereum,
 Doge,


Sheba
 Enu,
 and
 Cardano.
 All
 of
 those
 are


green.
 Yeah,
 this
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a


rotation.


Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.
 Look
 at
 the
 hour


chart
 on
 all
 these
 cryptos.
 All
 of
 them


up
 on
 the
 day.


This
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


rotation,
 folks,
 which
 would
 be
 nice
 to


see
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 are
 in
 more


crypto
 derivative
 plays
 than
 gold


derivative
 plays.
 Like
 the
 only
 gold


derivative
 plays
 are
 gold
 miners.


And
 yeah,
 it's
 gold
 miners,
 right?
 I


mean,
 that's
 it.
 Like
 you
 can
 either
 do


a
 gold
 ETF
 or
 a
 gold
 miner.


There's
 not
 that
 many
 other
 derivatives


to
 to
 to
 go
 long
 on
 gold.
 S&P
 672
 high


of
 days.
 S&P
 going
 green
 along
 with


Bitcoin
 and
 Amazon
 still
 up
 2.2.


So,
 you
 got
 Amazon
 and
 the
 S&P


going
 higher.


By
 the
 way,
 you
 know how
 I
 said


yesterday
 there's
 only
 two
 real
 business


models
 in
 the
 world.
 paying
 for
 a


product
 or
 advertising
 for
 a
 product.


Aka,
 you
 buy
 a
 product
 or
 service,
 you


pay
 a
 company
 money,
 or
 you
 pay
 someone


to
 get
 someone
 to
 buy
 your
 product
 or


service.
 And
 like
 that's
 how
 you
 can


that's
 how
 you
 can
 categorize
 the


majority
 of
 businesses
 on
 the
 planet.
 I


was
 thinking
 about
 it
 yesterday.
 There's


a
 third
 one.
 There's
 a
 third
 business


model
 that
 I
 I
 think
 these
 three


encompass
 the
 majority
 of
 every
 single


business
 on
 the
 planet.
 One
 is
 you
 buy
 a


product
 or
 service.
 One
 is
 advertising.


The
 other
 one
 is
 lending.


Lending.
 I
 can't
 believe
 I
 forgot
 that


banks
 I
 mean
 the
 other
 way
 to
 make
 money


on
 this
 planet
 Bit
 mine
 going
 green
 is


you
 charge
 people
 interest
 on
 giving


them
 money
 and
 you
 become
 you
 know
 a


pseudo
 bank
 to
 be
 able
 to
 to
 uh
 to


generate
 yield
 off
 the
 money
 that
 you're


lending
 out.
 I
 think
 that's
 how
 you


could
 sum
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 businesses
 on
 the


planet.
 People
 either
 directly
 pay
 for
 a


product
 or
 service,
 people
 pay
 for
 an


advertisement
 on
 a
 product
 or
 service
 or


people
 pay
 to
 borrow
 capital.


seems
 to
 be
 those
 are
 the
 three
 major


ways
 that
 you
 know
 people
 can
 end
 up


making
 money
 in
 the
 broader
 economy.


BMR
 going
 green.
 Matt
 says
 my
 full-time


is
 private
 money
 lending.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


lending
 is
 a
 massive
 Matt.
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 that
 because
 I
 was


looking
 at
 the
 margin
 debt
 and
 I
 was


just
 like
 all
 all
 these
 brokerages
 are


making
 tons
 of
 money
 off
 lending
 people


money
 and
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 a
 certain


cost
 of
 capital
 for
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have


the
 credit
 line
 to
 be
 able
 to
 lend


money.
 So
 there's
 someone
 making
 money


off
 them
 lending
 money.
 It's
 like
 it's


this
 cycle
 of
 just
 people
 constantly


lending
 out
 more
 money
 and
 hopefully


generating
 some
 yield
 on
 that
 money
 to


pay
 back
 the
 money
 that
 they're


borrowing.
 Bit
 mine

 there

Don
 Vin,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I


might
 quit
 how
 I
 get
 my
 adult


entertainment,
 but
 never
 quitting.
 AK


media
 travel
 has
 kept
 me
 away
 from
 this


community.
 Miss
 you
 guys.
 Don
 Vin,


appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.


I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 yeah
 that
 that
 you


know
 that
 is
 the
 goal
 at least
 for
 me
 to


hedge
 against
 AI
 is
 to
 try
 to
 you
 know


continue
 making
 authentic
 content
 that


can
 resonate
 with
 people
 and
 that's
 the


best
 way
 to
 keep
 this
 going
 and
 again
 I


do
 not
 mean
 to
 be
 on
 a
 rant
 today
 about


Oaklo
 or
 Quantum
 and
 you
 know
 Oaklo
 by


the
 way
 still
 down
 it's
 it's
 not
 really


getting
 that
 recovery
 like
 I
 have
 I
 have


zero
 vendetta
 against
 those
 companies
 I


I
 I
 do
 not
 care
 if
 you're
 in
 these


companies
 either
 like
 I'm
 not
 short
 I


don't
 have
 puts
 I'm
 not
 scre
 that
 I
 want


to
 see
 this
 thing
 go
 down
 so
 I
 can
 make


millions
 of
 dollars
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 just


personally
 really,
 really,
 really
 want


to
 keep
 this
 bull
 market
 going.


And
 I
 feel
 like
 most
 of
 us
 know
 the


stocks
 that
 don't
 have
 anything
 going


for
 them,
 going
 to
 the
 moon
 is
 not
 the


easiest
 way
 to
 keep
 it
 going.
 And
 so,


it's
 not
 to
 be
 aggressive
 against
 any
 of


those
 stocks.
 I
 try
 not
 to
 be
 super


super
 biased.
 Being
 bearish
 or
 bullish


like
 that,
 why
 would
 I
 want
 to
 do
 that?


I
 don't
 want
 to
 isolate
 people
 from


watching
 the
 content
 if
 I'm
 super


bearish
 on
 a
 name
 they
 like.
 I'm
 just


saying
 sometimes
 you
 got
 to
 call
 a
 spade


a
 spade.
 Like
 sometimes
 some
 of
 these


names
 just
 need
 to
 take
 a
 breather.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 go
 to
 zero,
 but
 they


cannot
 keep
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 for
 Nvidia
 to
 go


higher
 if
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other
 names
 are


going
 higher
 for
 no
 reason
 when
 Nvidia


is
 putting
 up
 the
 best
 earnings
 we've


ever
 seen
 in
 history


and
 that's
 why
 it's
 important.


Um,
 Dualingo
 right
 there,

 that's

 So,
 Duolingo

 bit

 TFC,
 that's
 up.
 Iran,
 nice


little
 recovery.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 down

 now
 it's
 down

So
 you
 do
 have
 some
 juice
 right
 there
 on


I
 ran

on
 the
 day.
 Pound
 here

 flat


at

Oscar
 continues
 to
 run
 as
 well.
 This


one,
 let's
 watch
 the
 video
 they
 put
 out


yesterday
 because
 we
 didn't
 watch
 the


video.
 Wow.
 6%
 move
 on
 Oscar.


They
 put
 out
 a
 video
 on
 their
 AI.


Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 this
 is
 what
 they


introduced
 yesterday.


Hello
 Menow
 is
 Oscar's
 bold
 new
 plan,


reimagining
 menopause
 care
 with
 real


talk
 and
 reliable
 resources.
 Say
 hello


to
 Z
 midlife
 care.


Say
 hi
 to
 menopause
 experts
 who
 get
 it


and
 rewards
 just
 for
 doing
 healthy


things.
 And
 don't
 forget
 to
 say
 what's


up
 to
 real
 savings
 on
 health
 care
 costs


because
 with
 Hello
 Menow,
 more
 care
 is


covered
 where
 it
 actually
 counts.
 And


with
 all
 of
 Oscars'
 great
 benefits,
 you


and


>> Okay,
 so
 that
 is
 a
 new
 product.


That
 might
 be
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 up
 more


than
 their
 OpenAI
 announcement


yesterday.


>> Question.


>> This
 was
 the
 OpenAI
 announcement


>> about
 your
 coverage
 or
 health.
 Meet


Oswell,
 your
 new
 AI
 health
 and
 benefits


pal.
 He's
 friendly.
 He's
 smart
 and
 he's


here
 for
 you
 24/7.


Ask
 Oswell
 anything
 about
 your
 plan,
 med


refills,
 or
 that
 weird
 hip
 thing
 you've


been
 ignoring.


Oswell
 keeps
 your
 health
 history
 and


plan
 details
 in
 mind,
 so
 his
 answers
 are


personalized.
 And
 he
 can
 point
 you
 to


great
 doctors
 and
 specialists
 in
 your


Oscar
 network.
 He'll
 even
 help
 you
 come


up
 with
 questions
 to
 ask
 during
 your


appointment.


Oh,
 and
 if
 you
 need
 Z
 virtual
 care
 or
 a


quick
 text
 visit,
 he's
 got
 you
 covered


with
 that,
 too.
 Oswell
 is
 hyped
 to
 get


to
 know
 you,
 so
 he
 can
 help
 out
 even


more.


>> Right,
 Oswell?


>> Okay.
 Uh
 it's
 either
 the
 Menopause


announcement
 or
 the
 Oslo
 announcement,


but
 uh
 Oscar
 up
 6%
 on
 the
 day
 based
 on
 a


partnership
 with
 OpenAI


and
 essentially
 creating
 a
 personalized


chatbot
 for
 all
 your
 data
 inside
 of


their
 proprietary
 application.
 You
 know,


the
 biggest
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 we've


seen
 from
 AI,
 at
 least
 in
 terms
 of
 the


use
 cases,
 and
 we've
 got
 to
 see
 more


than
 this,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 undeniable.


The
 biggest
 use
 case
 we've
 seen
 is
 chat


is
 a
 chatbot.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 chatbot


should
 not
 be
 the
 only
 use
 case
 of
 AI,


but
 can
 anyone
 name
 anything
 else


besides
 chat
 bots?
 Google
 right
 there


250
 losing
 2.4%.


Like
 it's
 chat
 bots
 across
 the
 board,


whether
 it's
 Canva


or
 what
 Robin's
 coming
 up
 with
 Cortex,


that's
 going to
 be
 a
 chatbot
 for


finance.


like


okay
 image
 creator
 I
 guess
 is
 the
 next


one
 but
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 outside
 of
 like


something
 creative
 something
 that
 people


are
 using
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis
 for


productivity
 it
 ends
 up
 just
 yeah
 FSD
 is


a
 whole
 different
 category
 I'm
 not
 I'm


not
 talking
 about
 FSD
 or
 robotics
 I'm


talking
 about
 like
 the
 things
 that
 we


all
 use
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 as
 we're


navigating
 our
 lives
 I
 it's
 these
 chat


bots
 and
 like
 you
 know
 maybe
 that's
 not


the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 I
 think


that
 the
 next
 evolution
 of
 that
 is
 for


it
 to
 be
 agentic
 aka
 we
 don't
 even
 have


to
 chat
 with
 a
 bot
 and
 That's
 where
 it


gets
 like
 really
 intense
 in
 terms
 of


productivity.


But
 so
 far
 the
 biggest
 use
 case
 has
 been


a
 chatbot
 that
 we've
 seen
 from
 AI
 and


hopefully
 robotics
 and
 FSD
 ends
 up


becoming
 the
 ma,
 you
 know,
 the
 major
 use


case.
 But,
 you
 know,
 outside
 of


transportation
 and
 physical
 labor,


it's
 a
 bot,
 whether
 it's
 a
 medical
 bot


or
 a
 lawyer
 bot,
 whatever
 type
 of
 bot
 it


is,
 it
 is
 a
 bot
 that's
 generating
 most


of


the
 productivity.


Now
 again,
 and
 this
 is
 why
 I
 think


Palenter
 gets
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a


premium
 because
 Paler
 is
 not
 just
 using


a
 bot.
 A
 lot
 of
 what
 they're
 using
 is


agentic
 workflows
 inside
 of
 the


enterprise.
 And
 based
 on
 what
 they


showed
 at
 AIPcon,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 examples
 of
 that.
 But
 that


that's
 like
 using
 the
 LLM
 almost
 as
 like


a
 foundational
 element
 to
 power


something
 happening
 versus
 one
 of
 their


clients
 just
 chatting
 with
 an
 LLM
 inside


of
 Palenture
 software
 to
 figure
 out
 the


answer,
 which
 which
 feels
 like
 the
 most


mundane
 version
 of
 what
 the
 use
 case


could
 become.
 So
 going
 green
 2877
 trying


to
 get
 back
 to
 29.
 That's
 up
 about
 28%


on
 the
 day.
 Dude,
 I
 thought
 music


creation
 would
 be
 a
 way
 bigger
 uh
 story


in
 AI
 than
 it
 would
 be.
 There
 was
 a


there
 was
 a
 a
 fake
 Drake
 and
 weekend


song
 that
 came
 out
 two
 years
 ago
 via
 AI.


It
 was
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 song
 and


it
 was
 like
 exploding
 on
 TikTok
 and
 then


you
 thought
 you
 would
 get
 more
 of
 that,


but
 like
 it
 didn't
 really
 turn
 into
 a


big
 industry
 like
 you
 know
 most
 people


that
 go
 on
 Spotify
 don't
 want
 to
 listen


to
 some
 AI
 generated
 nonsense.
 they
 want


to
 listen
 to
 Taylor
 Swift
 or
 Travis


Scott
 or
 like
 you
 know
 artists
 that
 you


have
 an
 emotional
 connection
 with.


So
 I
 feel
 like
 music
 creation
 has
 not


exploded


in
 this
 AI
 ecosystem


but
 obviously
 there
 are
 some
 people
 that


care
 more
 about
 AI.
 Why
 is
 Google
 down


3%?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 there's


any
 headline
 on
 Google.
 It
 looks
 like


there
 should
 be
 when
 a
 Google
 falls
 3%


like
 that.


Oh
 wow.
 Open
 AAI
 to
 debut
 a
 web
 browser


today.


Open
 AAI


to
 debut
 web
 browser
 today


at
 1:00.


Dude,
 OpenAI
 has
 been
 doing
 a
 lot
 of


these
 live
 streams.
 It's
 like
 one
 every


other
 week,
 bro.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 they're


really
 trying
 to
 prove
 that
 they
 can
 put


out
 new
 products
 into
 the
 world.


Okay.
 Okay.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 is
 for


Google,
 you
 know,
 how
 many
 people
 are


going
 to
 stop
 using
 Chrome
 and
 use
 Open


Eyes
 browser?


I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 I've
 used
 Chrome
 for


the
 past
 15
 years.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 hard


to
 stop
 using
 Chrome.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 freaking
 hard
 to


stop
 using
 it,


but
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 they
 come
 out
 with
 today.


There
 are
 people
 who
 make
 custom
 music


for
 their
 games
 that
 they
 stream.
 It's


actually
 pretty
 good.
 Yeah,
 there's


definitely
 a
 use
 case
 for
 the
 AI
 music


stuff.
 I
 just
 mean
 like
 an
 AI
 music


artist
 getting
 70
 million
 monthly


listeners
 on
 Spotify.
 That
 was
 kind
 of


what
 people
 were
 afraid
 about
 two
 years


ago.
 That's
 definitely
 what
 Spotify
 and


the
 record
 labels
 were
 afraid
 about


because
 how
 do
 they
 make
 money
 off
 that?


But
 that
 hasn't
 become
 a
 thing,
 right?


That
 AI
 musician
 that
 people
 want
 to


listen
 to
 more
 than
 listen
 to
 Justin


Bieber.
 Like
 no,
 they'd
 rather
 listen
 to


Justin
 Bieber
 because
 it's
 Justin


Bieber.
 There's
 like
 a
 connection
 to


Justin
 Bieber.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 really
 see
 a
 ramp


up
 in
 AI
 music
 that,
 you
 know,
 makes
 us


paradically
 change
 how
 we
 think
 of
 music


in
 general.
 Same
 thing
 with
 movies,


right?
 You
 know,
 we've
 not
 really
 seen
 a


real
 AI
 movie
 go
 viral
 yet.


That
 might
 be
 something
 in
 the
 future


that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Yeah,
 UMG
 did


get
 mad
 about
 the
 copyright
 about
 it,


but
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 there


was
 a
 a
 vast
 amount
 of
 people
 creating


this
 type
 of
 content,
 like
 it
 would
 find


a
 way
 to
 get
 distribution
 even
 if
 it


wouldn't
 be
 allowed
 on
 Spotify.
 And
 I
 I


just
 have
 not
 seen
 vi
 there
 was
 one


Drake
 AI
 song
 that
 went
 viral.
 And
 since


then,
 I've
 not
 really
 heard,


you
 know,
 more
 of
 those
 songs
 actually


coming
 out
 into
 the
 world.


I
 think
 the
 music
 part
 hasn't
 started


yet,
 but
 Timberland
 has
 done
 it.
 I
 have


seen
 Timberland
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 these


Instagram
 lives
 where
 he's
 like
 making


these
 different
 beats


and
 so
 you
 could
 see
 uh
 more
 excitement


at least
 on
 the
 side
 of
 producers
 that


are
 using
 AI
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 Here's


an
 update
 on
 China
 and
 what
 we've
 got


going
 on
 based
 on
 some
 of the
 new
 stuff


they
 announced
 this
 morning.


Well
 Sarah,
 this
 meeting
 is
 called
 the


fourth
 plenum
 and
 over
 the
 next
 four


years
 uh
 Xiinping
 and
 um
 other
 policy


makers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 mapping
 out
 uh


the
 uh
 the
 economic
 priorities
 for
 2026


until
 2030.
 And
 it
 probably
 comes
 as
 no


surprise
 to
 investors
 that
 the
 likely


focus
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on
 advanced


manufacturing
 as
 well
 as
 new


technologies
 such
 as
 AI,
 semiconductors,


robotics
 as
 well
 as
 new
 energy.
 Now,


this
 is
 a
 reassertion
 of
 what
 we
 already


know
 that
 the
 Xiinping
 administration's


primary
 goal
 is
 to
 turn
 China
 into
 a


global
 uh
 tech
 player
 um
 and
 really


dominating
 globally
 uh
 these


technologies.
 So
 in
 addition
 to
 that,
 of


course,
 uh
 the
 leadership
 wants
 these


technologies
 and
 tech
 innovation
 to


promote
 the
 economy.
 However,
 in
 the


past,
 uh
 few
 years,
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 we've


also
 seen
 that
 the
 Xiinping


administration
 hasn't
 really
 been
 paying


as
 much
 attention
 to
 policies
 that
 would


promote
 everything
 else
 such
 as


consumption
 and
 that
 um
 was
 showing


showing
 up
 in
 some
 of
 the
 economic
 data


that
 we
 had
 today.
 uh
 the
 FAI
 for


example
 contracted
 uh
 private
 investment


is
 down
 consumption
 met
 expectations
 but


these
 were
 very
 low
 expectations
 and


there
 is
 a
 an
 expectation
 and
 a
 belief


that
 some
 of
 um
 acknowledgement
 is
 going


to
 be
 had
 in
 the
 5-year
 plan
 of
 this


issue.
 Uh
 there's
 a
 belief
 that
 a
 policy


platform
 could
 be
 in
 place
 to
 try
 to


encourage
 more
 household
 consumption.


And
 uh
 there's
 some
 speculation
 that


this
 means
 that
 the
 uh
 that
 there
 we


could
 see
 some
 uh
 targets
 set
 at
 a
 local


level
 for
 consumption
 growth.
 Guys,


>> uh
 Ununice,
 there's
 been
 some
 who
 argue


that
 she
 has
 already
 started
 removing


some
 stimulus
 to
 the
 economy
 to
 let
 it


sort
 of
 slowly
 decelerate
 going
 into


these
 tougher
 discussions.
 Uh
 C
 can
 you


talk
 about
 to
 what
 level
 the
 government


is
 supporting
 activity?


Uh
 well
 the
 government
 has
 been


supporting
 some
 activity.
 We've
 seen


that
 over
 the
 past
 um
 couple
 of
 years
 I


would
 say
 but
 uh
 yeah
 these
 have
 been
 in


in
 fits
 and
 starts
 and
 um
 I
 I
 haven't


heard
 that
 he
 would
 be
 rolling
 back
 a


stimulus
 but
 there's
 definitely
 a
 belief


at
 this
 point
 um
 from
 many
 economists


that
 at
 least
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 this
 year


we
 probably
 won't
 see
 much
 more


stimulus.
 And
 part
 of
 that
 is
 because


the
 Q3
 number
 came
 in
 at
 4.8%.


That
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 slower
 than
 Q2.


And
 because
 the
 overall
 economic
 growth


target
 is
 5%,
 people
 are
 saying
 likely


the
 government
 is
 going
 to
 hold
 back.


And
 see,
 look,
 that
 GDP
 number
 being
 the


lowest
 in
 a
 year
 and
 that
 stimulus


starting
 to
 come
 to
 an
 end,
 China
 cannot


mess
 up
 any
 meaningful
 relationship
 with


the
 United
 States.
 Because
 if
 you're
 not


doing
 stimulus
 and
 you're
 not
 getting


your
 GDP
 growth
 to
 be
 at
 levels
 it
 was


at
 last
 year,
 which
 is
 still
 pretty
 good


at
 4.8%
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 at
 like
 6.2%.


2%.
 Losing
 the
 American
 consumer
 would


be
 the
 worst
 thing
 uh
 for
 the
 Chinese.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 feeling
 pretty


optimistic
 in
 South
 Korea.
 Trump
 and
 and


G
 get
 a
 deal
 done.


And
 if
 we
 do,
 then
 you
 know
 that
 could


be
 another
 bullcase
 going
 into
 the
 end


of
 earnings
 for
 the
 market.
 Google


really
 down
 4%
 on
 this
 OpenAI
 news
 of
 a


browser.


I
 mean,
 I
 I I
 I
 don't
 see
 why
 it
 is
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal
 for
 Google.
 I
 mean,
 yes,


theoretically
 people
 might
 stop
 using


Chrome,
 but
 OpenAI
 is
 gonna
 have
 to
 put


out
 a
 really
 good
 browser
 today
 to
 get


people
 to
 not
 care
 about
 Google.
 Look
 at


Bitcoin
 continuing
 to
 make
 a
 move.


Almost
 113,
 folks.
 At
 the
 same
 time,


gold
 continues
 to
 go
 down.


Maybe
 you're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


juice
 from
 gold
 into
 digital
 gold.


Maybe


Um,


Adobe
 also
 getting
 a
 move,
 CRM
 getting
 a


move.
 So,
 some
 of
 these
 plays
 that
 have


not
 really
 move,
 you
 know,
 again,
 going


back
 to
 the
 theme
 of
 today's
 show,


quality
 names
 getting
 a
 bid.
 Adobe
 up


4%.
 Salesforce
 up
 5%.


Your
 Oakloss,
 your
 D-Waves
 are
 down
 7%.


And
 look,
 I
 I
 don't
 love
 Salesforce
 and


Adobe
 as
 long-term
 investments,
 but
 I've


said
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 week,
 these


they're
 undervalued.
 You
 can't
 look
 at


their
 numbers
 and
 say
 they're
 not


undervalued.
 It's
 just
 there
 might
 be


better
 opportunities
 for
 your
 capital,


especially
 if
 they
 become
 value
 traps,


just
 like
 PayPal
 is
 undervalued.
 PayPal


up
 1.2%.
 You
 just
 might
 not
 want
 to
 be


in
 PayPal
 for
 the
 next
 year.


But
 if
 I
 had
 to
 pick
 between
 a


Salesforce
 getting
 love
 and
 a
 random


quantum
 name
 that
 has
 shown
 nothing


getting
 love,
 I
 would
 pick
 Salesforce


every
 day
 of
 the
 week.
 just
 healthier


for
 the
 market
 environment
 for
 a
 company


doing
 40
 billion
 in
 revenue
 to
 get
 a
 bit


of
 a
 boost.


So
 you
 are
 seeing
 potentially
 a
 bit
 more


of
 that
 rotation.


Ah
 this
 is
 a
 good
 point
 by
 Austin.


Interesting
 that
 OpenAI
 didn't
 build
 the


browser
 for
 Microsoft
 and
 Fix
 Edge
 but


instead
 are
 making
 their
 own
 Microsoft


would
 have
 given
 them
 distribution.
 That


is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 point.
 It's
 a
 hell.
 It


goes
 to
 show
 that
 Altman
 and
 Adella
 are


not
 boys,
 bro.
 They
 are
 not
 boys.


Like,
 how
 like
 why
 wouldn't
 they
 build


the
 Microsoft's
 distrib
 distribution
 is


massive.
 Bing
 still
 gets
 a
 billion
 users


or
 a
 billion
 visits
 every
 month.
 Google


gets
 88
 billion,
 but
 still,
 you
 know,


it's
 not
 like
 Bing
 is
 starting
 from


zero.
 If
 you
 could
 rebuild
 Microsoft


Bing
 and
 brand
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 more
 AI


version
 of
 what
 OpenAI
 is
 trying
 to


create,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 meaningful


partnership.
 However,
 OpenAI
 probably


thinks
 that
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 partner


with
 a
 legacy
 company
 like
 Microsoft
 on


search.
 They
 want
 to
 build
 their
 own


version
 of
 it.


And
 that
 that's
 nothing
 wrong
 for
 them


to
 to
 think
 like
 that.
 But
 it
 also
 goes


to
 show
 that
 they
 have
 zero
 intention
 of


like
 really
 building
 something
 special


with
 Microsoft.
 They
 just
 needed
 a
 lot


of
 the
 cloud
 computing
 with
 Azure
 back


in
 2023
 and
 they
 had
 to
 give
 Microsoft


one
 of
 the
 best
 deals
 ever
 to
 be
 able
 to


secure
 that
 that
 agreement,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 they


necessarily
 care
 of
 fixing
 Microsoft's


issues.


Even
 Copilot,
 right?
 Copilot
 started


using
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 models
 besides


OpenAI
 and
 Nadella
 doesn't
 really
 care


what
 model
 you
 use
 as
 long
 as
 you're


using
 it
 through
 Copilot.


um
 BMR
 now
 that
 ETH
 is
 above
 4,000
 is
 at


5465.
 Okay.


So,
 that
 one
 coming
 back
 to
 life
 as


well.


We
 need
 ETH
 to
 make
 a
 run
 to
 4500
 to
 get


Bit
 Mine
 closer
 to
 60.
 So,
 ET's
 really


got
 to
 make
 that
 move,
 but
 right
 now


it's
 kind
 of
 been
 stuck
 around
 35
 to


4,000.


Um,


yeah,
 Amazon
 really
 being
 the


the
 major
 winner
 on
 a


on
 a
 day
 like
 this.


Um,


Nebius,
 are
 we
 still
 Amazon
 right
 there?


222
 Nebius,
 are
 we
 still
 moving?
 Nebius


106.
 All right,
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 from


103.
 Hood
 still
 down
 1%
 of
 the
 day
 and


then
 pounder
 basically
 flat
 on
 the
 way.


The
 gold
 is
 still
 down.
 It
 it
 bounced
 a


little
 bit.
 It
 was
 down
 6%.
 Now
 it's


down
 4.6.


So
 you
 have
 somewhat
 of
 a
 move
 to
 the


upside,


but
 still
 down


overall
 on
 the
 day.
 Here's
 some


coverage,
 I
 think,
 on
 gold


that
 we
 might
 be
 getting
 here.
 said,
 "I


do
 think
 the
 sentiment
 around
 uh
 private


credit
 and
 the
 implications
 for
 regional


banks,
 for
 example,
 um
 tells
 us
 a
 lot


about
 how
 uncomfortable
 some
 market


participants
 are
 with
 the
 duration
 of


this
 rally.
 Look,
 we've
 got
 2023,
 we've


got
 2024,
 continued
 outperformance
 in


2025,
 but
 a
 key
 thing
 I
 anchor
 to
 when
 I


think
 about
 overall
 risks
 is
 how
 much
 of


this
 market
 is
 being
 driven
 by
 earnings


relative
 to
 multiples.
 And
 two-thirds
 of


the
 market
 is
 being
 driven
 by
 uh


earnings.
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to


exposures
 to
 some
 of
 the
 private
 debt,


um
 it
 is
 a
 more
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 smaller


investor
 base
 there
 and
 uh
 we
 don't


think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 like
 a
 this


spreading
 across
 many
 banks
 or
 many


credit
 funds,
 but
 people
 are
 going to


have
 to
 manage
 the
 risk.


>> Right.
 You
 said
 you
 were
 listening
 for


in
 the
 earnings
 calls
 hints
 about


productivity
 and
 whether
 or
 not
 this


tech
 boom
 would
 start
 to
 really
 start
 to


get
 monetized
 in
 the
 sense.
 Are
 you


hearing
 it
 so
 far?
 I
 know
 it's
 early.


>> Yeah.
 And
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 give
 a


couple
 small
 examples,
 but
 they're
 going


to
 want
 like
 big
 data,
 frankly,
 before


they,
 you
 know,
 pound
 the
 table
 and
 say,


"This
 is
 going
 to
 change
 the
 shape
 of
 my


labor
 um
 market
 or
 what
 we're
 going to


do
 to
 our
 workforce."
 We've
 already
 seen


pockets
 of
 significant
 productivity


growth
 even
 within
 City.
 Um,
 my
 CEO
 Jane


was
 talking
 about
 this
 last
 week.


>> The
 journal
 did
 a
 huge
 piece.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 really,
 really
 important.


We're
 at
 the
 beginning
 stages,
 I
 think,


of
 people
 knowing
 how
 to
 use
 these


tools,
 leveraging
 them,
 and
 increasing


their
 productivity.
 Does
 that
 lead
 to
 a


significantly
 smaller
 workforce
 over


time?
 I
 have
 I
 don't
 know.
 Um
 but
 I


think
 that
 the
 shape
 of
 our
 everyday


work
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 evolve.
 I


and
 my
 team
 continue
 to
 use
 many


different
 tools
 and
 alternative
 data
 in


ways
 that
 we
 had
 not
 in
 the
 past.
 So
 I'm


very
 excited
 about
 the
 kind
 of
 work
 and


investment
 analysis
 we
 can
 do
 uh
 with


the
 AI.
 I
 mean,
 the
 use
 cases
 are


exciting
 and
 and
 we
 heard
 some
 from
 the


CEO
 of
 KO
 in
 the
 last
 hour
 around


advertising
 and
 sales,
 making
 sales


processes
 more
 efficient
 and
 how
 they're


working
 on
 it
 from
 that
 that
 point
 of


view.
 Kate,
 the
 question
 is
 just
 what's


priced
 in
 by
 the
 market
 here
 and
 and
 is


it
 is
 it
 the
 capex
 numbers?
 Is
 that


what's
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 fuel
 the


hype
 and
 enthusiasm
 of
 the
 market
 as


long
 as
 those


>> NASDAQ
 trying
 to
 hold
 on,
 but
 Google


really
 getting
 wrecked
 here,
 bro.
 It


went
 from
 2.3%
 to
 5%
 down
 on
 this
 open


AI
 news.


And
 as
 she
 said
 right
 there,
 right,
 it's


a
 question
 of
 multiple
 expansion
 in
 the


midst
 of
 earnings.
 And
 you
 know,
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 gold
 is
 getting
 some
 love
 is


because
 people
 think
 that
 multiple
 not


like
 actual
 multiple,
 but
 the
 broader


sentiment
 around
 gold
 should
 continue
 to


expand.
 The
 sentiment
 around
 Google
 and


why
 the
 multiple
 is
 contracting
 right


here
 is
 because
 of
 this
 open
 AI
 news.


And


it
 feel
 I
 agree
 with
 Batty.
 It
 feels


like
 an
 overreaction.


It
 really
 does.
 Google's
 messing
 up
 the


S&P
 as
 well.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 that
 5%
 draw


down
 on
 Google.
 There's
 your
 uh
 what
 is


that?
 3%
 draw
 down
 on
 the
 S&P.


I
 don't
 know.
 We
 saw
 this
 happen
 last


time,
 too.
 This
 was
 like
 seven
 months


ago
 when
 OpenAI
 announced
 their
 plans
 to


create
 a
 browser.
 Google
 was
 down
 like


7%.
 But,
 you
 know,
 people
 kind
 of
 moved


on.
 They
 didn't
 care.


Google
 right
 here
 down
 4%.


Google
 to
 150,
 Oaklow
 to
 200.
 Yes.


Oh
 my
 gosh,
 dude.
 That's
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 now
 that
 I
 I
 I
 usually
 don't
 try


to
 go
 on
 a
 rant
 on
 these
 names.
 That's


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 now.
 That
 my
 rant


was
 the
 bottom
 of
 Oaklo.
 Oaklo
 is
 going


to
 go
 to
 freaking
 200
 and
 everyone's


going
 to
 be
 like,
 "All
 right,
 Amit,
 can


you
 rant
 about
 another
 stock
 so
 we
 can


buy
 that
 shit?"
 It's
 exactly
 what's


going
 to
 happen,
 bro.
 It's
 exactly
 how


this
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out.
 I'm
 praising


Google,
 on
 Oaklo,
 and
 Oaklo
 is


going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon.


It's
 what's
 going
 to
 happen,
 dude.
 It's


going
 to
 happen.


Yeah,
 tens
 of
 billions
 of
 market
 cap


wiped
 out
 on
 the
 announcement
 that


OpenAI
 might
 have
 a
 product
 and
 has
 zero


users.


Perplexity
 has
 released
 the
 browser
 as


well.
 Now,
 OpenAI
 has
 more
 distribution


than
 Perplexity.
 But
 look,
 here's
 the


other
 thing
 about
 why
 this
 OpenAI


browser
 news
 might
 not
 matter
 that
 much.


A
 lot
 of
 OpenAI's
 users
 are
 on
 their


phones
 and
 it's
 mobile.


I
 mean,
 like,
 yes,
 there's
 people
 that


obviously
 use
 it
 on
 desktop,
 but
 I
 don't


have
 the
 exact
 stats
 on
 this.
 I
 would


just
 my
 gut
 tells
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


using
 the
 mobile
 app
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 young
 and
 they're
 in
 college
 and


high
 school
 and
 they're
 using
 it
 to
 do


tasks
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 Ask
 all
 these


questions.
 Their
 behavior
 pattern
 is


already
 set
 with
 using
 Chrome
 as
 a


browser.
 They
 might
 go
 to
 Chrome
 and


then
 click
 on
 chatbt.com,
 but
 for
 them


to
 open
 up
 a
 brand
 new
 browser
 that


that's
 a
 whole
 different
 user


experience.
 It's
 not
 necessarily
 easy
 to


get
 people
 to
 switch
 to
 something
 like


that
 unless
 the
 product
 is
 definitively


better.
 And
 I
 guess
 at
 1
 p.m.
 we're


going
 to
 see
 what
 their
 live
 stream


looks
 like
 and
 how
 good
 that


announcement
 is
 because
 who
 knows,
 maybe


it's
 so
 much
 better
 than
 Chrome
 that
 it


blows
 away
 expectations.


But
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a


browser
 that
 directly
 links
 to
 chatb.


That's
 going to
 be
 the
 gist
 of
 it.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 that


exciting.


>> Yeah.
 Also,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 give
 all
 your


data
 to
 OpenAI?
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 this
 is
 a


big
 Look,
 I
 usually
 am
 not
 that
 like


nitpicky
 around
 people
 giving
 up
 their


data
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if


we
 agree
 to
 use
 these
 products,
 we're


going
 to
 be
 giving
 up
 our
 data.
 It's
 the


nature
 of
 how
 we
 operate
 in
 in
 a
 society


that's
 rooted
 in
 technology.
 However,


after
 Sam
 Alman
 said
 that
 about
 new


adult
 verticals
 on
 chat
 GBT,


immediately
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 do
 you


really
 want
 all
 your
 search
 results
 and


all
 those
 conversations
 being
 used
 to


train
 these
 models
 in
 OpenAI?


Which,
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 also
 going
 to


happen
 with
 Grock
 and
 Gemini.
 I
 get
 it.


But
 people
 already
 have
 a,
 you
 know,
 a


bad
 perception
 of
 Sam
 Alman
 and
 the
 way


he
 thinks
 about
 data.
 Similar
 to


Zuckerberg
 with
 Meta,
 right?
 People,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 just
 don't
 like
 Facebook


because
 of
 the
 perception
 of
 Zucks
 and


data.


It
 makes
 you
 wonder
 how
 many
 people


actually
 want
 to
 give
 up
 valuable
 search


data
 to
 a
 company
 that
 could
 be
 using
 it


for
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things.


Yeah,
 you
 gave
 everyone
 your
 birthday.


Yes,
 exactly.


So,
 I
 don't know.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.
 But
 yeah,
 dude,
 that
 quote
 right


there,
 Alman
 saying,
 "We
 are
 not
 the


moral
 police
 of
 the
 world
 tells
 you


everything."
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 would
 be


one
 to
 agree
 with
 that
 frame
 of


reference
 that
 a
 tech
 company
 should
 not


act
 as
 the
 moral
 police
 of
 the
 world.


However,
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI,
 like
 to
 to


take
 that
 type
 of
 a
 stance,


I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 It's
 a
 little


tonedeaf
 in
 my
 opinion.
 It's
 a
 little


tonedeaf.


Even
 even
 Figure
 the
 the
 Brett
 Adcock,


he
 was
 asked
 uh
 with
 uh
 with
 with
 Mark


Beni
 off
 at
 Dreams
 Force
 if
 he
 if
 you


would
 use


um
 your
 robots
 for
 military
 technology.


And
 he
 was
 like,
 "No."
 He
 was
 like, "We


don't
 want
 to
 be
 given
 robots
 to
 the


military."
 He's
 like,
 "That's
 that's
 not


the
 culture
 we're
 trying
 to
 build.
 We're


not
 trying
 to
 have
 robots
 on
 the


battlefield.
 We're
 trying
 to
 make
 robots


do
 your
 laundry."
 Right?
 He
 just
 he


doesn't
 want
 to
 be
 associated
 with
 that.


And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 ethical


implications
 to
 think
 about
 robots
 on


the
 battlefield.


And
 whatever
 side
 of
 the
 aisle
 you're
 on


on
 that,
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that


is
 super
 polarizing
 and
 requires
 a
 lot


of
 deep
 thought.
 Chalking
 it
 up
 to
 say


we
 are
 not
 the
 moral
 police
 of
 the


world.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


enough
 of
 a
 easy
 way
 to
 approach
 this


this
 ecosystem.


It's
 very
 lzair.


Maybe
 AI
 can't
 just
 be
 that
 lz
 fair.
 Bit


mine
 55.
 That's
 green.
 ETH
 trying
 to


break
 4,100.
 4,64.
 Bitcoin
 very
 close
 to


113.


Very
 close
 to
 113.


All right,
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get


there.


Uh,
 I
 am
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 stream


the
 GPT
 event.
 We'll
 cover
 it
 on
 the


close
 though,


but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 tough
 for


me
 to
 stream
 it.
 Dude,
 how
 is
 it
 11:30


already?
 Goodness,


the
 stream
 went
 by
 quick.
 I
 didn't
 even


notice
 that.
 Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin.


Ethereum
 4,000.
 Yeah,
 that's
 two
 hours


away,
 bro.
 That's
 a
 long
 time
 away
 for


that
 stream,
 but
 we'll
 cover
 it
 on
 the


close
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 Google
 tanks
 even


further.


Um,
 dude,
 is
 the
 NBA
 coming
 back


tonight?
 Why
 are
 you
 guys
 saying
 betting


NBA?
 Is
 the
 NBA
 back
 tonight?


Is
 the
 first
 NBA
 season
 game
 tonight?


Oh
 man,
 it's
 back
 tonight.
 This
 is
 not


pre-market,
 right?
 This
 is
 like
 a
 legit


game.
 Or
 is
 this
 pre-market


Lakers
 Warriors?


Dude,
 LeBron
 can't
 play,
 right?
 Because


freaking
 LeBron
 has
 the
 injury.


So,
 it's
 gonna
 be
 Luca
 versus
 Curry.


Okay,
 I'm
 definitely
 betting
 on
 this.


Does
 Robin
 Hood
 unveil
 the
 prediction


markets
 for
 the
 NBA?
 Oh,
 yep.
 It's


already
 there.
 Wow,
 it's
 already
 there.


58
 cents
 for
 the
 Warriors,
 43
 cents
 for


the
 Lakers.


Did
 I
 say
 pre-market?
 Oh,


I
 meant
 to
 say
 preseason.


>> This
 is
 how
 you
 know
 we're
 a
 junkie.
 But


this
 is
 how
 you
 know
 if
 the
 stock
 market


falls
 20%.
 There
 will
 be
 a
 select
 few
 of


us
 that
 come
 back
 every
 day.
 As
 sad
 as


it
 will
 be
 to
 see
 the
 red
 every
 day


because
 we
 are
 freaking
 junkies.


We
 are
 junkies.


Yeah,
 I'm
 definitely
 betting
 on
 that,


bro.


I
 I
 actually
 like
 the
 NBA
 and
 I
 I
 think


I
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 it
 than


football.
 So,


I
 think
 I
 gotta
 go
 Warriors,
 bro.
 I


think
 I
 gotta
 go
 Warriors.


Got
 to
 go
 Warriors
 today.
 Everything
 is


a
 market
 to
 admit.
 Exactly.


Kraken
 Robotics
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 All


right.
 So,
 Kraken
 again,
 these
 guys


trade
 OTC.
 They
 got
 a
 nice
 14%
 move.
 The


thesis
 on
 Kraken
 for
 those
 that
 haven't


heard
 of
 it
 and
 I've
 done
 not
 done
 a


major
 deep
 dive
 but
 essentially
 they
 are


one
 of the
 major
 suppliers
 for
 and


especially
 for
 their
 underwater


machines
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think


that
 hey
 if
 I
 can
 buy
 Kraken
 given
 they


have
 such
 tight
 relationships
 with
 Andro


which
 which
 is
 correct
 there's
 not
 that


many
 companies
 that
 have
 direct
 vendor


distributor
 relationships
 with
 Android


that
 is
 my
 proxy
 of
 owning
 Andro


I
 don't
 know
 how
 legit
 that
 argument
 is


I
 can
 understand
 people's
 uh
 eagerness


to
 think
 that
 Kraken
 is
 your
 proxy.


I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 the
 company
 to


be
 super
 excited
 about
 like
 their


financials
 or
 anything,
 but
 that
 has


been
 a
 majority
 of
 the
 reason
 that
 I've


seen
 people
 get
 excited
 about
 the
 name.


And
 so
 it
 is
 OTC.
 You
 can't
 buy
 it


easily.
 You're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 go


through
 I
 think
 on
 Schwab
 and
 Fidelity


they
 allow
 OTCs.
 Robin
 Hood
 Weeble
 is


not
 that
 easy
 to
 get
 OTC
 stocks.


Now,
 if
 this
 stock
 can
 make
 it
 onto
 the


NASDAQ
 on
 like
 a
 exchange
 that
 has


massive
 distribution,
 I
 think
 that's


when
 it
 can
 really
 start
 to
 make
 a
 move


because
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 in
 general
 just
 want


something
 as
 an
 Android
 proxy
 and
 if


they
 can
 easily
 buy
 it,
 they
 probably


would
 buy
 it.
 But
 as
 of
 now,
 it
 is
 still


uh
 still
 OTC.


Yeah,
 you
 likely
 could
 buy
 it
 on
 Schwab


because
 they
 they
 offer
 OTC
 names.


Silver
 and
 gold
 still
 down
 while
 Bitcoin


making
 its
 move
 112.8.
 Hey
 folks,
 the


last
 10
 days
 of
 October,
 if
 we
 see
 a


gold
 dump
 and
 a
 Bitcoin
 pump,
 that
 would


be
 fascinating
 because
 it
 would
 keep
 the


October
 thesis
 alive
 for
 freaking


Bitcoin.
 OTC
 is
 over
 the
 counter.
 That's


the
 term
 for
 it.
 So
 basically,
 it's
 not


on
 all
 the
 regulated
 exchanges.
 So


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 on
 OTC
 you


should
 stay
 away
 from.
 They're
 like
 p


pink
 sheet
 penny
 stocks,
 but
 there
 also


are
 some
 really
 good
 companies
 that
 just


haven't
 made
 their
 way
 to
 the
 regulated


exchanges.
 But
 if
 gold
 is
 down
 5%
 and


Bitcoin's
 up
 5%
 to
 end
 out
 the
 month,


Bitcoin
 gets
 to
 stay
 green
 for
 October


and
 maybe
 sets
 itself
 up
 really
 well
 for


November.
 Also,
 last
 couple
 days
 of


October,
 we
 get
 that
 rate
 cut.
 We
 get
 uh


we
 get
 we
 get
 October
 29th,
 we're
 going


to
 get
 25
 pips
 of
 a
 cut.


Theoretically,
 that
 should
 be
 way
 more


bullish
 Bitcoin
 than
 regular
 gold.


Again,
 gold
 is
 a
 hedge


against
 monetary
 policy.
 Bitcoin
 should


be
 leaning
 into
 monetary
 policy.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if
 we
 end


up
 getting
 that
 rate
 cut
 as
 well.


It's
 called
 October
 because
 out
 of
 the


last
 10
 October,
 nine
 of
 them
 have
 been


green
 and
 very
 green
 by
 that
 matter
 for


Bitcoin.
 Like
 we're
 talking
 about
 17%


months,
 10%
 months,
 25%
 months.


So,


still
 got
 10
 days
 left.
 Maybe
 that
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there


67195.
 Google
 still
 down
 4%


on
 this
 opening
 ideas.


Oh
 yeah,
 the
 other
 headline
 that
 could


be
 helping
 Bitcoin
 today
 is
 this


freaking
 this
 Fed
 meeting,
 right?
 We


talked
 about
 that.
 Yeah,
 that's
 live


right
 now.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 stream
 it,


but
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to
 watch
 it,
 I'll


put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 chat.
 It's
 on
 the


Fed's
 YouTube
 channel.
 They're
 having
 an


entire
 conference
 today
 around
 crypto


banking.


That
 could
 also
 be
 another
 reason


why
 Bitcoin
 and
 ETH
 are
 moving.
 Um,


Cointelegraph
 reporting
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 is
 studying
 a
 new
 payment


account
 model
 that
 would
 give
 fintech


and
 crypto
 firms
 limited
 access
 to
 Fed


payment
 rails
 without
 full
 banking


privileges.
 Wow.


That
 would
 be
 giving
 some
 of
 the
 banking


privileges,


not
 all
 of
 them,
 but
 some
 of
 them,
 some


of
 the
 ecosystem
 that
 the
 banks
 have


access
 to
 to
 these
 crypto
 firms.


That's
 actually
 pretty
 damn
 bullish.
 We


don't
 have
 the
 full
 details
 on
 what
 that


would
 look
 like,
 but
 that
 that
 would
 be


opening
 up
 a
 lot
 more
 space
 for


innovation
 and
 quite
 frankly,
 to
 be


honest,
 liquidity
 for
 these
 crypto


companies
 that
 get
 access
 to
 the
 payment


infrastructure
 of
 the
 Fed.


Yeah.
 That
 could
 be
 the
 reason
 Bitcoin.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 113.1.
 Now
 it's


moving
 107
 to
 113.
 $6,000
 candle


in
 two
 hours.


Is
 that
 bearish
 Galileo?
 I
 would
 hope


not.
 Dude,
 if
 not
 can
 put
 up
 some
 good


Galileo
 results
 next
 week,
 which
 I
 don't


expect,
 but
 if
 he
 does,
 Sofi
 could


really
 have
 some
 fun.
 But
 that
 might
 be


the
 2026
 story
 for
 Q1
 instead.


All
 right,
 cool.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.


Bitcoin,
 look,
 I'm
 losing
 my
 voice.
 I've


been
 talking
 for
 three
 hours.
 Bitcoin


113,
 Ethereum
 4,000,
 S&P
 holding
 flat
 on


the
 day,
 but
 still
 671.
 Not
 too
 bad.


Everything
 else
 relatively
 red
 outside


of
 Amazon.
 That's
 up
 2.5%.


And
 we'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 market
 close.


So,
 on
 the
 close,
 we
 will
 be
 reviewing


this
 OpenAI
 Google
 browser.
 I'll


probably
 tweet
 about
 it
 in
 a
 couple


hours.
 So,
 if
 you're
 following
 me
 on


Twitter,
 you
 will
 uh
 you'll
 get
 the


update
 there.
 Um,
 we'll
 talk
 about


Netflix
 earnings.
 That's
 a
 big
 one.
 So,


we'll
 do
 that.


And
 then
 we'll
 talk
 about
 uh
 technical


Tuesday.


So,
 we
 have
 Tech
 Tuesday,
 Netflix,
 and


this
 OpenAI
 stuff.
 And
 we'll
 see
 the


impact
 it
 has


ultimately
 on
 Google.
 Fear
 and
 greed.
 We


were
 at
 30
 on
 fear.
 We
 were
 at
 extreme


fear
 on
 Friday.
 We're
 at
 30
 on
 fear.


So,
 you're
 seeing
 fear
 and
 greed
 start


to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 normalized,


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Oh,
 wait.
 We
 got


to
 do
 the
 Netflix
 pump
 or
 dump
 pull.


Okay,
 last
 thing
 before
 I
 leave,
 then


we'll
 do
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 Netflix
 pump


or
 dump.
 Let's
 see
 what
 you
 guys
 say


right
 now
 versus
 right
 before.


Last
 time
 we
 all
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


pump
 and
 it
 dumped
 by
 like
 5%.


So,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 the


same
 results,
 but


we
 got
 to
 see.
 We
 got
 to
 see
 how
 this


plays
 out.
 Siege,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


tomato
 super
 chat.
 Tell
 your
 father
 I


said
 that
 there
 is
 no
 way
 AI
 could
 ever


replace
 your
 insight.
 Thank
 you
 for


everything
 you
 do.
 Siege,
 deeply,
 deeply


appreciate
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 hopefully,
 you
 know,


more
 people
 continue
 to
 uh
 enjoy
 the


authenticity
 of
 the
 content
 and
 the


mispronunciation
 of
 the
 content
 as
 well.


And
 look,
 I'm
 not
 going to
 be
 perfect.


AI
 probably
 will
 be
 perfect.
 I'll


probably
 get
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 wrong
 in


the
 course
 of
 my
 analysis
 after
 you
 do


this
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 But
 I
 think
 that


that
 also
 shows
 you're
 a
 human.
 If


everything's
 perfect
 via
 AI,
 it's
 not
 as


easy
 to


consume
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day.
 So,
 I


appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 as
 well.


Manohar,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50
 super


chat.
 Overall,
 data
 says
 SoFi
 Q3
 will


post
 a
 900
 million
 to
 1
 billion
 in


revenue.
 If
 SoFi
 actually
 hits
 1


billion,
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 you
 scream
 the


same
 way
 you
 did
 when
 pounder
 crossed


that
 mark.
 If
 they
 do
 hit
 1
 billion
 in


Q3,
 do
 you
 see
 SoFi
 heading
 towards
 40?


by
 end
 of
 year.
 Look,
 if
 they
 hit
 1


billion,
 that
 would
 be
 really
 bullish.


Obviously,
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 massive
 SoFi


position
 like
 I
 did
 when
 Hood
 and
 Paler


hit
 a
 billion.
 So,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


different
 emotionally,
 but
 I
 will
 be


very
 excited
 for
 you
 guys
 that
 are
 into


SoFi
 because
 I
 know
 retail
 is
 very,
 very


heavy.
 I
 mean,
 Josh
 was
 on
 the
 channel


yesterday.
 He
 has
 300,000
 shares
 of
 this


thing.
 So,
 it
 is
 a
 massive
 retail
 name.


Um,
 I
 think
 they
 can
 hit
 a
 billion
 based


on
 Tanner's
 videos.
 I
 think
 it's
 very


possible.
 He's
 been
 pretty
 bullish
 about


the
 member
 growth.
 If
 they
 hit
 a


billion,
 do
 I
 see
 $40
 by
 end
 of
 year?
 I


don't
 know
 if
 the
 billion
 is
 the
 reason


they
 would
 get
 to
 40
 by
 end
 of
 year.
 I


think
 the
 rate
 cuts
 and
 potential
 40%


growth.
 Remember
 they
 did
 44%
 last


quarter.
 That
 could
 be
 why
 they
 hit
 40


by
 end
 of
 year.
 A
 billion
 in
 and
 of


itself.
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's
 like
 the


only
 reason.
 But
 if
 they
 can
 get
 up
 the


growth
 and
 you
 know
 the
 real
 way
 they


hit
 40
 bucks
 is
 if
 that
 operating


leverage
 starts
 to
 get
 higher.
 I
 mean


that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 about
 pounder


hood
 that
 has
 really
 got
 the
 street


excited.
 Their
 operating
 margins
 are
 you


know
 40
 to
 50%.
 So
 is
 I
 think
 at
 like
 14


15%
 or
 something.
 that
 gets
 up
 anywhere


near
 20%.
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 gets
 the


street
 really
 excited,
 which
 means
 they


would
 just
 have
 a
 massive
 beat
 on
 EPS
 as


well.


All
 right,
 cool.
 That's
 what
 we
 got.


Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Let's
 do


word
 of
 the
 day
 and
 then
 uh
 we'll
 check


out
 the
 pre-market
 uh
 tonight
 for
 the


NBA
 season
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 the
 uh


Warriors
 can
 beat
 the
 Lakers
 and
 what


happens
 from
 there.
 I'm
 just
 kidding.
 I


know
 it's
 a
 preseason,


but
 it
 is
 funny
 that
 it
 said
 pre-market.


Word
 of
 the
 day


ka


ka


>> qua


qua


interjection


indeed.


Qua
 is
 an
 interjection
 used
 to
 express


surprise
 or
 contempt
 essentially
 meaning


indeed.


I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this
 word
 before.


I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this
 word
 before.


All
 right.
 If
 anyone
 wants
 to
 show
 their


uh
 affirmation
 with
 something
 that
 is


being
 said,
 they
 can
 say
 quota.


Quo
 is
 in
 quote.
 Yeah,
 I
 guess
 that's


this
 is
 a
 useless
 word.
 Some
 of
 these


words
 are
 weird.
 Some
 of
 these
 words
 are


weird.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 the


subscriber
 count
 for
 Netflix.


Unfortunately,
 they
 don't
 disclose
 that


anymore.
 So,


I
 mean,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 their


overall
 revenue
 growth,
 but
 we
 will
 not


be
 getting
 any
 subscriber
 numbers.
 54%


of
 you
 say
 pump
 on
 Netflix.
 54%
 of
 you


guys
 say
 pump.


I'm
 going
 with
 pump
 as
 well.
 I
 think


we're
 getting
 into
 holiday
 season.
 I


think
 it'll
 be
 good
 guidance.


I
 don't
 really
 think
 it
 dumps
 as
 the
 S&P


continues
 to
 do
 well.
 They
 would
 have
 to


have
 a
 really
 crappy
 earnings.
 It
 is


priced
 for
 perfection,
 though.
 Netflix


does
 trade
 at
 a
 multiple
 that's
 higher


than
 Nvidia
 and
 it's
 up
 40%
 this
 year.


So,
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 give
 us


good
 earnings,
 but
 if
 they
 if
 they
 do,


maybe
 we
 get
 a
 pump.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Thank


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Appreciate
 it.


Again,
 uh
 did
 not
 mean
 to
 trigger
 people


with
 the
 rant
 I
 went
 on
 today
 about
 some


of these
 unprofitable
 companies
 going
 to


the
 moon.
 If
 you
 own
 these
 names,
 I
 hope


you
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 them.
 I
 just


think
 for
 the
 health
 of
 the
 market,
 it's


prudent
 for
 a
 lot
 of these
 names
 to
 not


necessarily
 keep
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 go
 to
 zero,
 but
 they
 can't


keep
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 It's
 just
 very


hard
 for
 us
 to
 keep
 up
 this
 bull
 run.


And
 so
 seeing
 the
 S&P
 go
 green
 and
 a
 lot


of
 these
 names
 stay
 flat,
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 and


hopefully
 can
 continue
 to
 keep
 this


going
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 All
 right,
 that's


it.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll


see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 We
 got


the
 opening
 eye
 stuff,
 we
 got
 the


Netflix
 stuff,
 we
 got
 technical
 Tuesday,


and
 then
 we
 got
 Tesla
 tomorrow.
 And
 so


we'll
 do
 a
 preview
 on
 Tesla
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you


guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Buy
 one.
