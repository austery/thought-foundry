now
 let
 me
 start
 with
 some
 fresh


insights
 last
 week
 we
 received
 results


from
 a
 survey
 we
 sent
 out
 to
 our


portfolio
 companies
 about
 how
 they


perceive
 nature
 risk
 48%
 of
 the


responding
 companies
 now
 consider
 nature


risk
 to
 be
 financially
 material
 that


means
 it
 could
 impact
 the
 operations
 or


results
 and
 while
 survey
 responses
 as


you
 know
 they're
 not
 hard
 science
 this


validates
 our
 decisions
 to
 look
 further


into
 this
 risk
 and
 combine
 our


climate
 and
 nature
 disclosures
 into
 one


single
 document
 uh
 in


2024
 but
 let
 me
 be
 honest
 while
 it


conceptually
 makes
 sense
 to
 you
 know


treat
 these
 topics
 together
 the


complexity
 really
 became
 appearent
 when


we
 wrote
 These
 disclosures
 we
 are


dealing
 with
 different
 yet


interconnected
 risks
 and
 the
 portfolio


of
 over
 8,000


companies
 but
 that's
 why
 we
 organized


this
 event
 here
 today
 to
 share
 insights


Foster
 dialogue
 and
 collectively
 build


knowledge
 about
 nature
 and
 climate
 risks


and
 I'm
 fortunate
 to
 be
 joined
 by
 my


colleagues
 you
 can
 see
 here
 Mia


Christopher
 and
 Julia
 over
 the
 next
 25


minutes
 we
 will
 cover
 how
 the
 fund
 is


exposed
 to
 climate
 nature
 risks
 what
 our


portfolio
 companies
 are
 doing
 how
 they


addressing
 these
 risks
 and
 our
 future


priorities
 and
 after
 our
 presentation


very
 excited
 to
 welcome
 Dr
 Nicola
 Ranger


from
 Oxford
 University
 and
 Martin


skunker
 the
 former
 chair
 of
 the
 expert


group
 on
 climate
 risk
 and
 the
 fund
 and


very
 looking
 forward
 to
 hearing
 your


perspectives
 and
 your
 questions
 at
 the


end
 now
 turning
 to
 you


Mia
 let's
 come
 back
 to
 our
 my
 initial


point
 about
 combining
 our
 climate
 nature


disclosures
 could
 you
 explain
 why
 does


that
 integration
 make
 sense
 from
 a


science
 perspective
 I
 can
 I
 can
 so


climate
 systems
 and
 ecosystems
 exist
 in


a
 delicate
 balance
 so
 we
 know
 that


climate
 change
 threatens
 biodiversity


but
 we
 also
 know
 that
 healthy
 and


adaptive


ecosystems
 help
 us
 be
 more
 resilient
 and


mitigate
 climate
 change
 now
 scientists


have
 acknowledged
 these
 interconnections


for
 decades
 however
 among
 investors
 we


haven't
 really
 Quantified
 these


interconnections
 and
 that
 is
 something


we
 are
 actively
 working
 on
 now
 this
 is


important
 to
 us
 because
 nature
 provide


critical
 resources
 that
 fuel
 our
 economy


right
 so
 think
 by
 direct
 resources
 such


as
 food
 fuel
 or
 medicines
 or
 more


regulatory
 services
 such
 as
 carbon


sequestration
 and
 flood


control
 now
 these
 natural
 Services


underpin
 economic


development
 but
 they
 are
 rarely
 valued


in
 financial
 markets
 but
 for
 investors


it's
 about
 understanding
 the
 future
 risk


reward
 of
 our
 current
 Investments
 and


also
 potential
 investment


opportunities
 traditional
 climate


scenario
 models
 don't
 really
 account
 for


the
 economic
 impacts
 it
 has
 on
 natural


systems
 and
 the
 future
 availability
 of


Natural


Resources
 for
 example
 I'll
 give
 you
 one


um
 example
 from
 the
 from
 the
 Fisheries


on
 how
 climate
 change
 have
 an
 impact
 on


species
 and
 that
 then
 how
 the
 species


have
 an
 impact
 on
 an
 Industries
 as
 for


example
 Fisheries
 so
 as
 the
 ocean


temperature
 is
 changing
 Studies
 have


found
 that
 fish
 docks
 move
 following
 the


preferred
 temperatures
 so
 when
 climate


change
 lead
 leads
 to
 changes
 in
 species


distribution
 the
 fishermen
 also
 need
 to


follow
 addressing
 these
 in


interconnections
 between
 climate
 and


species
 leads
 to
 better
 measurement
 of


future
 risk
 and
 this
 is
 what
 we
 are


working
 on
 in
 the
 fund
 so
 now


Christopher
 is
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 how


we
 measure
 this
 currently
 on
 the


portfolio


thank
 you
 uh
 Mia
 so
 there's
 actually
 a


very
 interesting
 story
 about
 uh


emissions
 uh
 in
 the
 fund
 the
 big
 picture


as
 we
 know
 is
 that
 Global
 emissions
 are


continuing
 to
 go


up
 and
 this
 uh
 means
 a
 warmer
 World
 a


more
 volatile
 world
 and
 this
 is
 a
 big


risk
 uh
 to
 the
 fund
 in
 the
 long
 term
 so


this
 worries
 us
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Blue


Line
 uh
 on
 this
 chart
 it
 shows
 the


emissions
 associated
 with
 listed
 markets


globally
 and
 they
 have
 gone
 up
 as
 I
 said


now
 the
 funds
 Benchmark
 makes
 some


adjustments
 to
 this


index
 particularly
 we
 remove
 ethical


exclusions
 related
 to
 coal
 and
 the


removal
 of
 these
 companies
 contribute
 to


lowering
 the
 emissions
 of
 The
 Benchmark


relative
 to
 the
 index
 and
 that
 is
 done


at
 the
 ministry


level
 the
 fund
 does
 not
 have
 a
 separate


decarbonization


Target
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the


recommendations
 that
 Martin
 made
 three


years
 ago
 when
 he
 put
 forward
 his
 report


with
 recommendations
 on
 how
 climate
 risk


should
 be
 should
 be
 uh
 managed
 in
 the


fund
 and
 this
 recommendation
 was


accepted
 by
 by
 parliaments
 we
 don't
 have


a
 separate
 decarbonization
 goal
 but


emissions
 in
 our
 portfolio
 have


marginally
 declined
 over
 this


period
 and
 that's
 interesting
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 for
 that


is
 that
 we
 have
 divested
 from


companies
 with
 high
 emissions
 I'll
 get


back
 to
 that


uh
 next
 yeah
 so
 risk-based
 Investments


these
 are
 decisions
 financial
 decisions


to
 sell
 companies
 that
 we
 believe
 have


unsustainable
 business
 models
 they
 add


long-term
 risk
 to
 the
 fund
 and
 we
 can


sell
 them
 they
 are
 not
 ethical


exclusions
 so
 they're
 different
 from
 the


work
 of
 the
 Council
 on
 ethics
 they


remain
 in
 the
 fund's
 Benchmark
 and
 so


they
 contribute
 to
 the
 relative
 risk
 of


the
 fund
 and
 they're
 financially


motivated
 in
 uh
 last
 year
 we
 did
 49


divestments
 10
 of
 these
 were
 associated


with
 climate
 and
 nature
 related


risks
 when
 companies
 improve
 we
 can


bring
 them
 back
 in
 we
 can
 reverse


previous
 decisions
 many
 of
 the


divestments
 we've
 made
 were
 made
 10


years
 ago
 uh
 or
 more
 and
 so
 last
 year
 we


started
 reviewing
 many
 of
 those


decisions


and
 and
 we
 decided
 to
 reverse
 16
 of
 them


eight
 of
 these
 were
 related
 to
 climate


and
 nature
 uh
 related


risks
 I
 mentioned
 that
 risk-based


divestments
 are
 financial
 decisions
 so


like
 all
 our
 investment
 decisions
 we


track
 Returns
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 this
 picture
 is
 quite
 positive
 and


interesting
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 the


cumulative
 effect
 of
 these
 decisions
 has


increase
 the
 uh
 returns
 of
 the
 fund
 by


64
 basis
 points
 or
 more
 than
 16
 billion


croner
 climate
 related
 divestments
 have


made
 the
 biggest
 contribution
 in
 part


because
 they
 account
 for
 the
 largest


share
 of


divestments
 nature
 related
 uh


divestments
 have
 also
 contributed


positively
 so
 there's
 a
 story
 here
 if
 we


sell
 risky
 companies
 with
 unsustainable


business
 models
 and
 reinvest
 in
 the


broader
 Market
 we
 can
 generate
 a


positive
 return
 that's
 at
 least
 the
 the


the
 experience
 from
 the
 last
 10
 years


but
 as
 we
 can
 see
 these
 returns
 are


volatile
 so
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 will


continue
 to
 be
 positive
 uh
 in
 the


future
 now
 we
 measure
 climate
 risk
 using


different
 methods
 this
 is
 stated
 in
 our


mandate
 but
 it's
 also
 prudent
 we
 don't


believe
 a
 single
 metric
 tells
 the
 whole


story
 we
 need
 to
 look
 at
 a
 menu
 of


different
 metrics
 to
 understand
 risk
 in


the


fund
 scenario
 analysis
 is
 a
 tool
 for


understanding
 how
 different
 climate


scenarios
 might
 impact
 the
 fund
 over


time
 so
 this
 is
 an
 important
 part
 of
 our


toolkit


um
 we
 have
 used
 a
 bottom
 up
 approach
 for


the
 last
 four
 years
 this
 is
 where
 we


started
 with
 this
 work
 it
 basically


means
 you
 you
 estimate
 the
 net
 losses
 of


climate
 change
 at
 company
 level
 and
 then


you
 aggregate
 that
 up
 to
 portfolio
 level


we've
 looked
 at
 a
 range
 of
 climate


scenarios
 including
 scenarios
 with
 very


high
 levels
 of
 warming
 the
 results
 show


estimated
 portfolio
 losses
 between
 2
 and


10%
 it's
 quite
 modest
 if
 you
 think
 about


these
 these
 include
 scenarios
 with
 very


high
 warming
 so
 we
 have
 identified
 a


number
 of
 weaknesses
 with
 the
 bottomup


approach
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 extensively


in
 the


report
 to
 to
 further
 develop
 this
 work


we've
 developed
 some
 internal
 top-
 down


approaches
 the
 first
 one
 looks
 and
 this


is
 the
 starting
 point
 here
 is
 the


macroeconomy
 so
 it
 doesn't
 start
 with


companies
 it
 starts
 with
 the


macroeconomy
 and
 the
 GDP
 effects
 of


climate
 this
 exercise
 yielded
 19%
 loss


for
 us


equities
 under
 a
 current
 policy
 scenario


so
 it's
 a
 fairly
 moderate
 warming
 so
 if


we
 look
 at
 a
 more
 extreme
 warming


scenario
 we
 might
 have
 even
 higher


losses
 in
 addition
 we
 started
 looking
 at


how
 nature
 risk
 could
 be
 included
 in


these
 scenario
 models
 as
 Mia
 said


currently
 this
 is
 a
 very
 nent
 field
 uh


under
 development
 so
 we
 looked
 we
 worked


with
 a
 set
 of
 academics
 at
 the


University
 of


Minnesota
 and
 looked
 at
 what
 the
 effect


of
 Glo
 on
 global
 GDP
 would
 be
 if
 three


ecosystem
 Services
 collapsed
 there
 are


three
 out
 of
 total
 18
 ecosystem
 Services


it
 doesn't
 capture
 all
 of
 nature
 risk


but
 it's
 a
 portion
 of
 it
 and
 the
 result


was
 roughly
 2%
 GDP


loss
 so
 what
 can
 we
 learn
 from
 all
 of


this
 well
 we
 can
 see
 that
 the
 the
 um


results
 across
 these
 different
 models


vary
 and
 we
 know
 why
 because
 they


measure
 different
 things
 they
 have


different
 assumptions
 different
 inputs


different


scenarios
 we
 also
 know
 that
 they're
 in


their
 early
 stages
 they're
 continuously


develop
 and
 and
 this
 is
 good
 but
 it
 does


mean
 that
 you
 cannot
 compare
 results


over


time
 they
 also
 don't
 say
 much
 about
 the


pricing
 of
 climate
 risk
 in
 the
 market


and
 this
 is
 critical
 information
 for


making
 investment


decisions
 so
 for
 that
 reason
 we're
 not


using
 them
 the
 results
 directly
 to
 make


decisions
 but
 more
 as
 a
 way
 to


understand
 broader
 portfolio
 risk
 and


how
 to
 use
 different
 models
 to
 better


account
 for


that
 right
 Alexis
 maybe
 you
 can
 talk
 us


through
 how
 we
 work
 with
 these
 issues
 as


an
 active
 owner
 thank
 you
 Christopher


um
 companies
 are
 really
 the
 core
 of
 our


approach
 how
 we
 manage
 climate
 risk


because
 in
 our
 climate
 action
 plan
 2025


that
 lays
 out
 our
 strategy
 to
 address


climate
 risks
 we
 State
 basically
 that
 em


engaging
 with
 the
 highest
 emitters
 in


our
 portfolio
 in
 is
 the
 core
 of
 our


strategy
 and
 since
 our
 portfolio
 broadly


represents
 the
 market
 our
 climate
 risk


exposure
 mirrors
 market-wide
 risks


channeled
 through
 these
 companies
 so


ultimately
 how
 these
 companies
 address


and
 manage
 the
 risks
 determines
 our


portfolio
 risk


exposure
 in
 2024
 we
 engaged
 519


companies
 on
 climate
 and
 nature
 issues


we
 conducted
 141
 Net
 Zero
 dialogues


these
 are
 in-depth
 often
 multi-year
 long


dialogues
 about
 companies
 climate


targets
 transition
 plans
 and
 emission


reductions
 and
 we
 set


753
 specific
 objectives
 for
 these


dialogues
 based
 on
 company's
 plans
 and


progress
 versus
 peers
 and
 as
 you
 can


imagine
 doing
 this
 effectively
 requires


robust
 quantitative
 and
 analytical


foundations
 to
 determine
 which
 companies


should
 we
 engage
 with


which
 issues
 to
 prioritize
 and
 how
 do
 we


measure
 progress
 over


time
 and
 the
 starting
 point
 for
 our
 work


our
 public
 expectation
 documents
 on
 how


we
 want
 our
 portfolio
 companies
 to


manage
 sustainability
 risks
 they
 are


financially
 motivated
 this
 is
 about


ensuring
 that
 risks
 are
 well
 managed
 and


businesses
 create
 value
 over
 time
 what's


new
 in
 24
 we
 took
 the
 important
 step
 to


quantify
 all
 our
 expectations
 in


quantifiable
 score
 SC
 creating
 a


powerful
 tool
 for
 us
 to
 measure
 to
 what


extent
 companies
 actually
 fulfill
 our


expectations
 and
 these
 scores
 behind


them
 lies
 a
 sophisticated
 methodology
 we


combine
 multiple
 data
 sources
 we
 use
 AI


to
 extract
 further
 data
 points
 and
 we


apply
 machine
 learning
 techniques
 to


fill
 data
 gaps
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 seek


ways
 to
 improve
 these
 scores


further
 how
 are
 companies
 performing
 in


2024
 these
 numbers
 tell
 an
 interesting


story
 climate
 scores
 average


56%
 meaning
 the
 average
 company
 in
 our


portfolio
 meets
 over
 half
 of
 our


expectations
 and
 we
 are
 seeing
 constant


improvement
 over
 the
 last
 years


biodiversity
 lags
 behind
 standing
 at


32%
 but
 with
 a
 faster
 growth
 rate
 than


on
 climate
 suggesting
 companies
 are


waking
 to
 Nature


risks
 the
 biodiversity
 Gap
 you
 could
 say


is
 most
 pronounced
 in
 risk
 management


and
 Target
 setting
 aspects
 few
 companies


have
 actually
 concrete
 biodiversity


goals
 and
 for
 climate
 the
 blind
 spot


really
 remains
 a
 lack
 of
 transparency
 by


companies
 on
 how
 they
 engage
 with


regulators
 and
 policy
 makers
 and
 Julia


will
 explore
 this
 issue
 towards
 the
 end


of
 the


presentation
 now
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about


management
 practices
 and
 disclosures
 but


the
 question
 is
 how
 does
 that
 actually


affect
 corporate
 performance
 we
 don't


have
 good
 sustainab
 sustainability


performance
 indicators
 for
 many
 top


Nicks
 but
 we
 have
 a
 good
 starting
 point


when
 it
 comes
 to
 climate
 companies
 scope


one
 into
 two
 emissions
 and
 the
 graph
 you


can
 see
 here
 shows
 you
 actually
 how
 the


companies
 do
 on
 our
 Focus
 list
 that's


the
 list
 where
 the
 highest
 emitters
 are


on
 um
 we
 have
 in
 our
 portfolio
 and
 here


we
 cluster
 them
 by
 that
 23
 scoring
 on


our
 climate
 expectation
 scores
 so
 the


black
 line
 here
 shows
 you
 the
 companies


meeting
 at
 least
 75
 5%
 of
 our


expectations
 they
 had
 declining


emissions
 since
 the
 Paris
 agreement


since


2015
 and
 now
 the
 compan
 is
 scoring
 wors


on
 our
 climate
 score
 you
 can
 see
 that


actually
 emissions
 went
 up


since
 um
 our
 starting
 point
 here
 we
 have


in


2015
 that's
 reassuring
 we're
 capturing


something
 meaningful
 these
 correlations


give
 us
 some
 confidence
 actually
 that


when
 we
 address
 company
 management
 and


disclosure
 practices
 that
 that
 likely


affects
 corporate
 performance
 over


time
 key
 indicator
 when
 it
 comes
 to


companies
 management
 of
 climate
 risks


are
 whether
 they
 have
 robust
 Net
 Zero


Targets
 this
 graph
 here
 shows
 you
 the


development
 how
 many
 how
 much
 of
 our


finance
 emissions
 are
 covered
 by
 Net


Zero
 targets
 and
 we
 reached


74%
 last
 year
 so
 theoretically
 these


emissions
 they're
 all
 managed
 addressed


by
 the
 companies
 and
 should
 go
 decline


to
 Net
 Zero
 by


2050
 while


encouraging
 you
 may
 have
 seen
 in
 the


news
 over
 the
 last
 month
 there
 are


companies
 pushing
 out
 targets
 or


cancelling
 that
 zero
 targets
 so
 whether


you
 know
 the
 future
 progress
 is
 more


uncertain
 than
 this
 positive
 trajectory


have
 seen
 over
 the
 last


years
 scrutiny
 of
 targets
 is
 also


increasing
 last
 year
 the
 science-based


targets
 initiative
 that's
 the
 main
 body


in
 a
 way
 to
 evaluate
 and
 approve


corporate
 n
 zero
 targets
 removed
 at


least
 87
 companies
 because
 they
 didn't


submit
 the
 Net
 Zero
 Targets
 in


time
 that
 gives
 us
 actually
 good
 setting


to
 analyze
 how
 do
 these
 targets
 how
 are


they
 value
 by
 financial
 markets
 so
 here


with
 this
 research
 piece
 we're
 looking


at
 the
 stock
 market
 reaction
 to
 these


companies
 not
 or
 being
 chucked
 out
 by


spti
 and
 we
 can
 see
 in
 develop
 Market


we
 see
 a
 statistically
 significant


negative
 um
 share
 price
 reaction
 of
 over


2%
 when
 companies
 around
 the
 event
 when


companies
 lost
 their
 Target
 in
 Emerging


Markets
 that's
 not
 uh
 statistically


significant
 and
 obviously
 we
 need
 to


remember
 this
 is
 an
 event
 study
 right
 we


have
 a
 small
 sample
 um
 but
 still
 I
 think


it
 suggests
 that
 in
 developed
 countries


really
 financial
 markets
 take
 that
 into


account
 and
 react
 to
 a
 company
 losing


approval
 of
 its
 Target
 and
 that
 could
 be


either
 because
 the
 market
 is
 concerned


about
 the
 company's
 management
 of


climate
 issues
 or
 it
 can
 be
 seen
 more


broadly
 as
 an
 indicator
 of
 poor


corporate
 management
 quality
 if
 you
 kind


of
 suggest
 and
 commit
 but
 then
 you
 can't


follow
 through
 and
 set
 and
 get
 a
 Target


approved
 now
 this
 completes
 uh
 the
 chain


I
 wanted
 to
 lay
 out
 from
 management


quality
 to
 sustainability
 performance


year
 emissions
 to
 to
 actually
 how


financial
 markets
 react
 to
 changes
 in


management
 indicators
 it's
 peac
 mail
 but


I
 think
 that's
 how
 we
 need
 to
 break
 down


the
 problem
 of
 how
 sustainability


factors
 affect
 asset


prices
 we
 also
 believe
 that
 supporting


academic
 research
 is
 very
 important


specifically
 now
 that
 the
 financial


implications
 of
 climate
 and
 and
 nature


risk
 become
 more
 apparent
 this
 is
 really


not
 the
 time
 to
 say
 we
 know
 enough
 and


we
 have
 recently
 funded
 three
 new


projects
 with
 a
 National
 Bureau
 of


economic
 research
 with
 NYU
 and
 with


Imperial
 College
 in
 London
 and
 we
 have


entered
 a
 research
 collaboration
 with


the
 University
 of
 surich
 on
 this
 survey


I
 mentioned
 in
 my
 introductory


remarks
 and
 I
 want
 to
 share
 a
 few
 more


insights
 from
 this
 survey
 conducted
 with


Professor
 s
 and
 Vagner
 and
 my
 colleague


snada
 here
 at
 the
 fund
 we
 sent
 out
 the


survey
 in
 February
 so
 the
 data
 is
 brand


new
 we
 had
 over
 300
 companies
 responding


on
 their
 perceptions
 of
 nature
 risk
 and


I
 want
 to
 share
 few
 key
 figures
 from


this
 survey
 with


you
 already
 today


44%
 of
 the
 responding
 companies
 believe


physical
 nature
 risks
 has
 a
 financially


material
 effect
 on
 their
 companies
 while


28%
 believe
 the
 same
 is
 true
 as
 for


transition
 risk
 and
 just
 to
 remind


ourselves
 physical
 risk
 here
 refers
 to


the
 direct
 impacts
 of
 nature


degradation
 um
 whereas
 transition
 risk


is
 more
 about
 regulatory
 changes
 policy


changes
 and
 shifts
 in
 consumer


preferences
 as
 we
 move
 to
 more


sustainable


economies
 for
 context
 there
 was
 a
 survey


carried
 out
 in


2019
 on
 investor
 preferences
 actually
 um


perceptions
 of
 climate
 risk
 and
 it


showed
 nearly
 the
 opposite
 results
 where


55%
 of
 the
 investors
 actually
 felt
 that


um
 transition
 risk
 was
 already
 material


whereas
 only
 34%
 said
 the
 same
 about


physical


risk
 these
 findings
 they
 suggest
 two
 key


observations
 and
 again
 acknowledging
 we


are
 comparing
 surveys
 from
 different


points
 in
 time
 and
 different
 respondence


group


first
 physical
 risks
 appear
 more


material
 relative
 to
 transition
 risks


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Nature
 while
 the


opposite
 holds
 true
 for


climate
 second
 that's
 probably
 important


finding
 the
 level
 of
 risk
 awareness
 for


nature
 seems
 comparable
 where
 we
 were


when
 it
 came
 to
 risk
 Awareness
 on


climate
 6
 years


ago
 Julia
 we're
 seeing
 rapid
 evolution


of
 our
 assessment
 and
 knowledge
 uh
 and


awareness
 of
 of
 these
 risks
 what
 are
 the


key
 areas
 we
 still
 need
 to
 understand


better
 yes
 thank
 you
 while
 we
 have
 made


progress
 with
 our
 combined
 disclosures


we
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 learn
 about


nature
 risk
 all
 sectors
 in
 our
 portfolio


depend
 on
 healthy
 ecosystems
 and
 Water


Resources
 we
 have
 identified
 several


sectors
 that
 could
 potentially
 have
 very


high
 impact
 on
 nature
 including
 basic


materials
 food
 producers
 and
 energy
 in


total
 companies
 comprising
 20%
 of
 net


asset
 value
 could
 potentially
 have
 very


high
 impact
 on


nature
 this
 assessment
 provides
 a
 useful


overview
 but
 it
 does
 not
 allow
 us
 to


assess
 individual
 companies
 risk


exposures
 and
 guide
 our
 engagement
 with


companies
 therefore
 a
 more
 granular


analysis
 is
 needed
 our
 goal
 will
 be
 to


better
 understand
 which
 natural


resources
 our
 companies
 rely
 on
 and
 how


companies
 can
 impact
 this
 complex
 system


as
 Mia
 already
 mentioned
 we
 also
 need
 to


gain
 a
 better
 understanding
 of
 the
 links


and
 trade-offs
 between
 nature
 and


climate
 to
 fully
 understand
 the
 funds


risk


exposures
 this
 year
 we
 have
 taken
 a


first
 step
 to
 understand
 location


specific
 nature
 risk
 this
 map
 shows


asset
 locations
 of
 our
 tech
 companies
 in


our
 portfolio
 and
 their
 exposure
 to


water
 stress
 areas


you
 might
 notice
 though
 that
 these


assets
 are
 clustered
 in
 certain


regions
 and
 one
 of
 the
 missing
 pieces


here
 we
 believe
 is
 value
 chain


data
 um
 and
 we
 need
 to
 understand
 not


only
 how
 nature
 risk
 affects
 direct


operations
 but
 entire
 Supply


chains
 and
 our
 next
 step
 will
 be
 to


utilize
 open-
 Source
 geospatial
 data
 to


understand
 these
 location
 specific
 risk


better
 and
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 access
 already


publicly
 available


data
 for
 climate
 we
 will
 focus
 on
 three


key
 areas
 climate
 performance
 corporate


policy
 engagement
 and
 scenario
 analysis


it
 is
 key
 for
 us
 to
 understand
 company's


actual
 results
 versus
 their
 stated
 goals


and
 this
 leads
 us
 to
 another
 very


important
 question
 on
 company's
 actions


do
 companies
 with
 Net
 Zero
 targets
 Lobby


against
 climate


policies
 we
 recently
 published
 a
 view
 on


responsible
 corporate
 policy
 engagement


but
 we
 have
 actually
 raised
 this
 topic


for
 nearly
 20
 years
 and
 given
 our


long-term
 interest
 and
 Diversified


Investments
 we
 now
 want
 to
 understand


this
 better
 we
 are
 utilizing
 an
 AI


driven
 approach
 again
 to
 uncover


misalignments
 between
 public
 commitments


and
 actual
 lobbying


activities
 as
 Christopher
 mentioned
 we


also
 will
 continue
 developing
 our


scenario
 analysis
 for
 climate
 and
 nature


and
 we
 believe
 that
 this
 is
 crucial
 for


understanding
 how
 physical
 risk
 will


impact
 the
 fund
 in
 the
 future
 so
 now
 I'm


really
 looking
 forward
 to
 hearing


perspectives
 from
 our
 panel
 on
 how
 to


manage
 nature
 and
 climate
 risk
 going


forward
 please


yeah
 so
 we're
 really
 really
 pleased
 to


be
 joined
 by
 uh
 nicoa
 Ranger
 and
 Martin


skunka
 to
 eminent
 panelists
 with
 a


wealth
 of
 knowledge
 on
 this


topic
 uh
 so
 let
 me
 start
 with
 you
 uh


Martin
 you
 authored
 a
 seminal
 report
 on


climate
 risk
 and
 the
 fund
 not
 me
 alone


not
 you
 alone
 with
 a
 commission
 but
 you


were
 the
 face
 of
 it
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 was


highly
 anticipated
 it
 made
 a
 number
 of


recommendations
 and
 most
 of
 them
 were


accepted
 uh
 by
 Parliament
 this
 was
 3


years
 ago
 so
 now
 we
 feel
 like
 it's
 a


very
 different
 time
 so
 I
 want
 to
 start


with
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 has
 changed


and
 both
 in
 in
 the
 world
 around
 us
 uh


relevant
 to
 climate
 risk
 and
 how
 this


should
 be
 managed
 uh
 by
 a
 financial


investor
 uh
 yes
 thank
 thank
 you
 for
 for


having
 me
 um
 a
 lot
 has
 changed
 actually


I
 went
 back
 to
 look
 at
 the
 report
 and


fall
 about
 you
 would
 what
 would
 have


done
 differently
 now
 uh
 and
 it's


striking
 how
 much
 has
 changed
 in
 just


three
 years
 I
 think
 um
 on
 uh
 physical


risk
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 publication
 also
 of


the
 sixth
 assessment
 report
 from
 the


ipcc
 that
 came
 I
 think
 March


2023
 gave
 us
 I
 think
 a
 richer
 Fuller


picture
 of
 physical
 risks
 uh
 and
 we


might
 come
 back
 to
 this
 but
 I
 think


there
 are
 some
 structural
 sort
 of


methodological
 issues
 that
 have
 to
 do


with
 how
 we've
 modeled
 this
 that
 has
 led


us
 to
 significantly


underestimate
 uh
 physcal
 risks
 and
 I


just
 looked
 at
 you
 the
 survey
 you
 did


2019
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 uh


when
 we
 did
 this
 report
 I
 think
 we
 also


had
 sort
 of
 not
 maybe
 explicitly
 but


implicitly
 there
 was
 an
 assumption
 that


uh
 what
 matters
 in
 the
 very
 sort
 of
 near


term
 medium
 term
 is
 transition
 risk


physical
 risks
 are
 really
 important
 but


they're
 sort
 of
 further
 out
 on
 the


future
 I
 think
 if
 I
 were
 to
 write
 this


report
 today
 I
 would
 have
 stressed
 that


physical
 risks
 are
 actually
 very


material
 and
 important
 also
 in
 the
 short


and
 medium
 term
 so
 I
 think
 we
 actually


underestimated
 the
 near-term
 effects
 of


fiscal
 risk
 so
 that's
 number
 one
 on


transition
 risks
 um
 I
 think


the
 uh
 the
 mindset
 then
 was
 that
 uh
 and


I
 think
 uh
 inspired
 a
 lot
 by
 the
 ngfs


the
 network
 network
 for
 Greening
 of
 the


financial
 system
 and
 their
 work


categorizing
 uh
 you
 know
 physical


transition
 risk
 and
 uh
 orderly


disorderly
 uh


transitions
 um
 so
 as
 a
 former
 consultant


I
 love
 2
 by
 two
 matrices
 so
 I
 was
 for


very
 uh
 inspired
 by
 that
 I
 still
 think


that
 framework
 or
 that
 way
 of


categorizing
 makes
 sense


but
 in
 2020
 2021
 I
 think
 we
 thought
 that


there
 were
 several
 viable


orderly
 Pathways
 to
 Net


Zero
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 exist


anymore
 um
 and
 it's
 a
 little
 like
 uh
 you


know
 the
 famous
 opening
 line
 of
 Anna


coren
 says


all
 uh
 happy
 families
 are
 the
 same
 and


unhappy
 families
 are
 all
 different


because
 there's
 only
 one
 way
 to
 be
 happy


and
 you
 check
 all
 the
 boxes
 and
 there


are
 many
 many
 ways
 of
 being
 unhappy
 and


I
 think
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 transition


risks
 um
 I
 think
 we're
 at
 a
 point
 where


um
 there
 aren't
 really
 many
 orderly


Pathways
 to
 n
 zero
 maybe
 none
 but
 there


are
 many
 many
 different
 ways
 a


disorderly
 transition
 could
 play
 out
 and


I
 think
 what
 we
 don't
 understand
 is
 what


are
 the
 relevant
 dimensions
 of


disorderly
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 investors
 need


to
 think
 about
 what
 could
 disorderly


look
 like
 and
 I'm
 hoping
 and
 I
 know
 that


you
 norus
 bank
 is
 involved
 in
 work
 with


updating
 the
 ngfs
 scenarios
 I
 think
 uh


and
 now
 working
 in
 the
 partly
 in
 the


private
 sector
 and
 and
 chairing
 the
 risk


Committee
 of
 a
 of
 a
 large
 investor
 uh
 I


think
 we
 would
 be
 hoping
 for
 some
 more


guidance
 on
 how
 we
 can
 think


systematically
 about
 the
 different
 ways


in
 which
 a
 transition
 can
 be
 disorderly


and
 I
 would
 have
 focused
 more
 on
 that
 I


think
 if
 I
 were
 to
 write
 a
 report


today
 so
 Nicola
 let
 me
 bring
 you
 in
 so


Martin
 mentioned
 the
 the


underestimation
 of
 physical
 risk
 in
 the


near
 term
 and
 so
 and
 I
 also
 mentioned
 in


my
 my
 uh
 remarks
 that
 the
 models
 that
 we


use
 and
 see
 tend
 to
 underestimate
 this


risk
 you've
 worked
 extensively
 with
 uh


with
 climate
 modeling
 nature
 modeling


and
 also
 with
 a
 variety
 of
 uh
 of
 uh


participants
 in
 the
 financial
 industry


insurers
 Banks
 central
 banks
 so
 what
 is


your
 uh
 current
 kind
 of
 assessment
 of


the
 state
 of
 these
 models
 and
 and
 how


are
 they
 used
 um
 in
 the
 financial


industry
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 and
 firstly


thank
 you
 for
 inviting
 me
 to
 be
 here
 and


also
 huge
 congratulations
 for
 this
 um


brilliant
 work
 that
 you've
 been
 doing


and
 really
 really
 welcome
 it
 um
 so
 so
 to


answer
 the
 question
 I
 well
 firstly
 I


would
 say
 the
 mo
 most
 of
 the
 scenarios


that
 we
 use
 or
 financial
 institutions


are
 using
 are
 not
 representing
 the
 risk


so
 they're
 not
 representing
 what
 say
 the


ipcc
 tells
 us
 are
 the
 key
 physical
 risks


and
 they're
 definitely
 not
 representing


the
 link
 between
 climate
 and
 nature


risks
 and
 so
 what
 what
 we
 see
 so
 when
 uh


We've
 interviewed
 financial
 institutions


for
 example
 particularly
 Banks
 and


insurers
 that
 I
 mainly
 work
 with
 um
 we


find
 actually
 they
 know
 this
 as
 well
 so


they're
 looking
 at
 the
 scenarios
 and


they're
 asking
 exactly
 the
 same


questions
 that
 the
 scientists
 are
 asking


and
 and
 knowing
 that
 there's
 something


hugely
 missing
 in
 these
 scenarios
 and


you
 for
 example
 you
 we
 did
 a
 survey


after
 the
 bank
 of
 England's
 stress
 test


so
 the
 bank
 of
 England
 did
 its
 first


climate
 stress
 test
 about
 two
 years
 ago


where
 they
 provided
 financial


institutions
 a
 set
 of
 scenarios
 and


asked
 them
 to
 run
 them
 and
 report
 back


on
 the
 findings
 and
 we
 did
 a
 big
 survey


with
 the
 bank
 of
 England
 afterwards
 of


of
 all
 the
 participating


firms
 and
 all
 of
 them
 said
 they
 did
 not


believe
 these
 scenarios
 actually


represented
 the
 risk
 and
 these
 scenarios


were
 based
 on
 the
 ngfs
 scenarios
 with
 a


sort
 of
 tweak
 to
 represent
 the
 UK
 on
 top


of
 that
 so
 we
 know
 that
 they
 they're


underestimating
 the
 risk
 but
 some


specific
 areas
 and
 I
 would
 say
 on


transition
 risk
 as
 well
 I
 totally
 agree


with
 you
 and
 they're
 not
 picking
 up
 the


the
 disorderly
 transition
 scenarios
 that


we
 see
 out
 of
 the
 window
 now
 um
 and


they're
 also
 I
 think
 not
 picking
 up
 the


fact
 that
 in
 reality
 it's
 not
 going
 to


be
 that
 we
 see
 transition
 risk
 or


physical
 risk
 we're
 now
 in
 a
 world
 where


we're
 going
 to
 see
 these
 two
 things


together
 and
 actually
 impacting
 many
 of


the
 same
 sectors
 at
 the
 same
 time
 um
 but


come
 coming
 on
 to
 sort
 of
 specific


things
 on
 on
 the
 um
 physical
 side
 that


that
 we
 see
 sort
 of
 in
 in
 the
 research


that
 we're
 doing
 so
 I
 focus
 on
 a
 a


number
 of
 different
 aspects
 of
 it
 so
 one


one
 is
 around
 extreme
 events
 um
 I
 also


particularly
 focus
 on
 things
 like


cascading
 and
 compounding
 risk
 so
 how


these
 different
 things
 play
 out
 how
 they


transmit
 across
 different
 countries
 and


some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 can
 see
 is


that
 for
 example
 the
 the
 scenarios
 that


are
 being
 used
 are
 not
 even
 really


thinking
 about
 extreme
 events
 so
 until


actually
 the
 latest
 version
 of
 the


version
 five
 of
 the
 um
 ngfs
 scenarios


they
 were
 not
 capturing
 really
 any


extreme
 events
 um
 now
 they're
 doing
 a


bit
 better
 but
 they're
 still
 not


capturing
 the
 types
 of
 events
 that
 we


see
 again
 from
 looking
 out
 of
 the
 window


and
 I
 used
 to
 work
 in
 the
 insurance


industry
 that
 the
 insurance
 industry
 is


very
 aware
 of
 um
 these
 are
 not
 captured


in
 the
 the
 types
 of
 scenarios
 that
 are


being
 used
 um
 by
 investors
 and
 banks
 at


the
 moment
 they
 they're
 also
 not


capturing
 said
 these
 cascading
 risks
 and


what
 do
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 so
 what
 what
 we


can
 see
 whenever
 so
 when
 when
 a
 disaster


hits
 what
 are
 the
 big
 things
 that
 really


affect
 the
 economy
 so
 it's
 yes
 there
 is


the
 reconstruction
 of
 buildings
 and
 that


sort
 of
 thing
 and
 that
 and
 we
 pretty


much
 are
 able
 to
 capture
 that
 now
 but


what
 we
 know
 is
 really
 causing
 the
 r
 of


things
 like
 power
 networks
 going
 down


Interruption
 to
 um
 uh
 water
 supplies
 U


people
 not
 being
 able
 to
 get
 to
 work
 all


of
 these
 these
 what
 we
 call
 these
 sort


of
 network
 risks
 and
 not
 captured
 at
 the


moment
 and
 we
 know
 that
 actually
 a
 lot


of
 the
 risk
 is
 coming
 from
 uh
 these


types
 of
 things
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 work
 we


do
 is
 to
 try
 to
 capture
 these
 added


risks
 and
 we
 know
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to


at
 least
 double
 if
 not
 more
 the
 the
 size


of
 the
 r


risks
 coming
 on
 to
 the
 the
 nature
 side


again
 I
 really
 appreciate
 um
 the
 work


that
 you're
 doing
 really
 really
 great


and
 I
 I
 know
 s
 of
 in
 the
 we
 were
 just


commenting
 the
 other
 day
 in
 the
 social


media
 field
 that
 this
 is
 everyone's


picking
 up
 on
 this
 work
 and
 and
 really


applauding
 it
 and
 I
 certainly
 do
 as
 well


um
 I
 think
 on
 on
 the
 nature
 side
 so
 I


think
 this
 is
 the
 it's
 the
 elephant
 in


the
 room
 and
 we
 wrote
 this
 paper
 with


the
 ngfs
 called
 the
 green
 scorpion
 which


was
 our
 version
 of
 this
 isn't
 the


elephant
 in
 the
 room
 it's
 the
 great


green
 scorpion
 in
 the
 room
 that's
 going


to
 sort
 of
 hit
 us


um
 these
 risks
 are
 not
 taken
 into


account
 and
 they
 interplay
 it's
 very


very
 difficult
 to
 separate
 climate
 and


nature
 risk
 because
 they're
 fully


interconnected
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 couple


actually
 from
 some
 work
 that
 I'm
 doing


with
 the
 World
 Bank
 at
 the
 moment
 um
 so


I
 just
 picked
 out
 a
 few
 that
 I
 know
 are


linked
 to
 um
 your
 portfolio
 or
 or
 your


your
 geographical
 portfolio
 at
 least
 so


Brazil
 for
 example
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


risks
 in
 Brazil
 right
 now
 are
 how
 um


land
 conversion
 so
 we
 all
 know
 about
 the


Amazon
 but
 the
 other
 areas
 like
 the
 the


Sado
 for
 example
 land
 conversion
 in
 the


Sado
 which
 is
 very
 much
 linked
 to
 mining


is
 putting
 huge
 impacts
 on
 aquifers
 and


impacting
 on
 on
 water
 availability


across
 the
 whole
 country
 and
 this
 is
 an


enormous
 potential
 limit
 to
 growth
 so


it's
 that
 interplay
 between
 these
 nature


related
 factors
 but
 also
 the
 climate
 so


the
 increased
 pressure
 from
 um
 changes


in
 weather
 conditions
 but
 also
 what's


happening
 in
 terms
 of
 Economic


Development
 and
 these
 things
 are
 coming


together
 and
 they're
 amplifying
 each


other
 the
 other
 one
 I
 mentioned
 is
 is


Morocco
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 one
 as


well
 so
 Morocco
 as
 well
 big
 water


constraint
 issue
 so
 they
 have
 huge


potential
 in
 terms
 of
 Renewables
 um
 but


they
 can't
 exploit
 that
 at
 the
 moment


because
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 water
 to
 do


it
 so
 this
 is
 putting
 a
 constraint
 on


their
 growth
 and
 is
 also
 impacting
 on


the
 agricultural
 system
 so
 this


interplay
 between
 water
 energy
 land


nature
 is
 all
 coming
 together
 and


amplifying
 and
 again
 we're
 not
 taking


account
 of
 that
 at
 the
 moment
 I
 think
 on


the
 the
 nature
 side
 one
 of
 the
 big


things
 that
 that
 I've
 been
 particularly


sort
 of
 pushing
 on
 is
 we
 often
 associate


nature
 when
 we
 think
 about
 nature
 risk


we
 think
 about
 the
 birds
 and
 bees
 and


butterflies
 that's
 not
 where
 the
 big


risks
 are
 going
 to
 come
 from
 yeah


everyone
 everyone
 loves
 birds
 and
 bees


and
 butterflies
 I
 do
 but
 that's
 not


what's
 going
 to
 get
 the
 economy
 and
 it's


not
 what's
 going
 to
 hit
 investors
 and


you
 know
 I
 the
 the
 2%
 number
 you
 you
 uh


quoted
 you
 that's
 based
 on
 Fisheries


Timber
 and
 pollinators
 again
 like


Fisheries
 Timber
 and
 pollin
 pollinat
 are


important
 but
 for
 a
 small
 part
 of
 the


food
 system
 um
 Timber
 Fisheries
 again


really
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 local


livelihoods
 but
 for
 the
 whole


macroeconomy
 not
 big
 so
 that's
 why


you're
 seeing
 such
 this
 tiny
 2%
 number


if
 you
 took
 into
 account
 these
 big
 water


supply
 issues
 big
 soil
 quality
 issues


impacting
 on
 our
 food
 system
 you
 can


very
 easily
 get
 into
 um
 10
 20%
 uh


potential
 losses
 to
 GDP
 so
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 I
 think
 we
 we're


making
 a
 lot
 of
 progress
 I
 don't
 want
 to


sound
 too
 negative
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 we
 need
 just
 need
 to
 be


aware
 that
 are
 missing
 at
 the
 moment
 so


so
 it
 sounds
 like
 from
 your
 your
 summary


is
 that
 we
 we
 actually
 know
 quite
 a
 bit


of
 this
 risk
 and
 we
 also
 know
 that
 the


models
 don't
 capture
 all
 of
 it
 so
 what


is
 the
 state
 of
 kind
 of
 pricing
 this


risk
 in
 the
 market
 which
 I
 said
 was
 a


critical
 point
 like
 what
 do
 you
 think


Martin
 is
 uh
 to
 what
 extent
 are
 I
 think


investors
 factoring
 this
 in
 so
 I
 think


some
 of
 these
 risks
 are
 at
 least


understood
 I
 think
 the
 transition
 risk


on
 climate
 is
 relatively
 easy
 to
 model


because
 you
 can
 model
 it
 essentially


at
 least
 the
 Direct
 effects
 as
 sort
 of


increasing
 the
 price
 of
 CO2
 emissions


and
 see
 how
 it
 affects
 corporate


profitability
 and
 I
 think
 most
 companies


are
 doing
 this
 so
 that's
 not
 I
 think


capturing
 some
 of
 the
 indirect
 effects


are
 more
 that's
 more
 challenging
 um
 just


to
 take
 an
 example
 from
 Norway
 so
 you


increase
 the
 price
 of
 CO2
 emissions
 that


creates
 a
 lot
 of
 demand
 from
 oil


companies
 for
 electricity
 to
 decarbonize


their
 uh
 operations
 but
 that


increases
 the
 energy
 prices
 for
 other


companies
 including
 companies
 that
 have


already
 Electrify
 their
 production


processes
 and
 have
 zero
 emissions
 so


even
 thinking
 about
 you
 had
 this
 graph


about
 you
 financed
 emissions
 or


emissions
 from
 the


portfolio
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 say
 a


lot
 about
 risk
 because
 it
 could
 be
 lots


of
 transition
 risks
 even
 for
 companies


with
 zero


emissions
 because
 we're
 I
 think
 uh
 to


use
 uh
 sort
 of
 Economist
 speak
 we're


thinking
 too
 much
 of
 this
 as
 a
 partial


equilibrium
 problem
 but
 it
 is
 a
 general


equilibrium
 problem
 and
 we
 have
 market


failure
 in
 very
 many
 markets
 that
 are
 a


necessary
 integrated
 part
 of
 the


transition
 and
 so
 in
 terms
 of
 policy


prescriptions
 I
 think
 we
 have
 thought


too
 much
 in
 terms
 of
 finding
 optimal


policies
 when
 we're
 faced
 with
 this


enormous
 uncertainty
 we
 should
 be


thinking
 more
 about
 finding
 robust


policies
 no
 regret
 moves
 and
 thinking


more
 systematically
 about
 how
 can
 we


make
 decisions
 that
 will
 minimize
 the


expected
 regret
 in
 the


future
 um
 so
 for
 climate
 policy
 you
 know


very
 very
 simplified
 you
 can
 make
 two


mistakes
 right
 one
 is
 you
 have
 a
 very


strict
 climate
 policy
 and
 it
 turns
 out


oh
 the
 climate
 issue
 wasn't
 so
 important


after
 all
 so
 that's
 one
 policy
 mistake


or


you
 could
 have
 a
 very
 LAX
 unambitious


climate
 policy
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 oh


this
 was
 a
 really
 important
 big


problem
 which
 C
 which
 policy
 mistake
 do


you
 think
 you'll
 regret
 the


most
 well
 clearly
 you'll
 regret


most
 having
 triggered
 irreversible


climate


change
 the
 regret
 of
 having
 a
 too


ambitious
 climate
 policy
 will
 be
 pretty


small
 because
 it
 simply
 means
 that
 you


would
 have
 been
 speeding
 up
 maybe
 too


fast
 a
 transition
 to
 local
 carbon


technologies
 that
 have
 many
 other


advantages


anyway
 and
 so
 I
 think
 this
 whole


modeling
 you
 know
 an
 economists
 love


their


models
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


problems
 of
 of
 these
 models
 particularly


the
 so-called
 integrated
 assessment


models
 the
 models
 that
 combine
 sort
 of
 a


climate
 model
 with
 a
 macroeconomic
 model


is
 that
 they
 are
 by
 their


nature
 uh
 equilibrium
 models
 they
 are
 uh


they
 always
 uh
 search
 for
 an


equilibrium
 but
 an
 equilibrium
 model
 is


not
 really
 a
 good
 way
 of
 understanding


risk
 because
 you're
 not
 interested
 in


what
 happen
 happens
 at
 the
 equilibrium


point
 you're
 interested
 in
 what
 happens


in
 the
 tail
 end
 of
 a
 probability


distribution
 sorry
 and
 that's
 not


captured
 at
 all
 so
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to


move
 away
 from
 thinking
 about
 this
 in


terms
 of
 optimizing


policy
 and
 thinking
 more
 about


robustness
 and
 that
 goes
 even
 at
 the
 Cor


level
 thinking
 about
 how
 robust
 are
 your


corporate
 strategies
 across
 a
 range
 of


different


scenarios
 and
 minimizing
 regression
 I


think
 that
 robustness
 way
 of
 thinking


that
 you
 know
 thinking
 about
 robustness


is
 a
 much
 better
 way
 of
 dealing
 with


deep
 uncertainty
 that
 we
 have
 in
 this


space
 would
 like
 to
 S
 thank
 first
 of
 all


um
 you
 too
 thanks
 a
 lot
