Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 the
 Book
 Review


Podcast.
 I'm
 MJ
 Franklin.
 I'm
 an
 editor


here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review.


And
 this
 week
 on
 the
 podcast,
 we
 have
 an


author
 you've
 probably
 heard
 of
 if


you've
 been
 keeping
 up
 with
 literary


fiction
 at
 all
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years.


That
 author
 is
 Brandon
 Taylor.
 Brandon's


first
 book,
 Real
 Life,
 published
 in


February
 2020,
 right
 before
 the


pandemic,
 changed
 life
 as
 we
 know
 it.


And
 that
 book
 went
 on
 to
 become
 a
 Booker


Prize
 finalist.
 He
 followed
 that
 up
 with


two
 other
 books,
 Filthy
 Animals
 in
 2021


and
 The
 Late
 Americans
 in
 2023.


Now
 Brandon
 is
 back
 with
 a
 brand
 new


book,
 Minor
 Black
 Figures.
 It's
 a
 novel


about
 art
 and
 race
 and
 class
 and


religion
 and
 love
 and
 New
 York
 and
 so


much
 more.
 He
 joins
 us
 today
 to
 discuss.


Brandon,
 welcome.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


or
 I
 should
 probably
 say
 welcome
 back


because
 you
 joined
 the
 book
 review


podcast
 in
 2021
 to
 talk
 about
 Sally


Rooney's
 beautiful
 world
 where
 are
 you


which
 you
 reviewed
 for
 us
 and
 then
 that


interview
 was
 conducted
 by
 Pamela
 Paul


who
 was
 the
 editor
 at
 the
 time
 but
 we've


spoken
 previously
 because
 right
 before


your
 first
 book
 Real
 Life
 came
 out
 I


wrote
 a
 profile
 of
 you
 for
 the
 book


review
 that
 was
 remote
 now
 we're
 in


person
 welcome
 back


oh
 thank
 you
 how
 far
 we've
 come
 how
 far


we've
 I
 feel
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 that


Vanity
 Fair
 Billy
 Isish
 same
 interview.


Do
 you
 know
 about
 this?


Yes,
 I
 Yes.


So,
 for
 anyone
 listening
 who
 doesn't


know,
 every
 year
 they
 interview
 Billy


Isish
 and
 through
 that
 all
 together
 you


get
 to
 see
 an
 artist's
 evolution.
 So,


I'm
 excited
 to
 talk
 to
 you,
 learn
 about


your
 new
 book,
 hear
 about
 what
 you've


been
 up
 to,
 which
 is
 quite
 a
 lot.
 But
 to


get
 started,
 let's
 talk
 about
 your
 new


book,
 Minor
 Black
 Figures.
 Can
 you
 just


give
 us
 a
 brief
 setup,
 spoilerfree,
 but


tell
 us
 what
 is
 this
 book
 about?


Minor
 Black
 Figures
 is
 about
 Wyth,
 who


is
 a
 black
 gay
 male
 painter
 living
 in


New
 York
 City,
 and
 we
 encounter
 him
 at


the
 start
 of
 a
 sort
 of
 hazy
 late
 summer


scenario
 where
 he's
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 a


artist
 block.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 how
 to


paint
 the
 moment,
 whatever
 that
 is.
 He's


in
 search
 of
 the
 real,
 whatever
 that


means
 indeed.
 And
 after
 going
 to
 a


terrible
 art
 show,
 or
 he
 thinks
 it's
 a


terrible
 art
 show,
 he
 encounters
 another


young
 man
 whose
 name
 is
 Kading.
 And
 then


he
 very
 quickly
 discovers
 that
 Keading


is
 a
 former
 seminarian.
 And
 then
 they


spend
 a
 summer
 walking
 and
 talking
 about


God,
 about
 art,
 about
 politics,
 about


the
 meaning
 of
 life.
 Oh,
 just
 the
 light


stuff.


All
 the
 light
 stuff.
 All
 the
 light


stuff.
 So
 that's
 what
 it's
 really
 about.


It's
 about
 art.
 It's
 about
 love.
 It's


about
 faith.
 And
 it's
 about
 what
 happens


when
 you
 encounter
 a
 priest
 at
 a
 bar.


One
 one
 hazy
 summer
 night
 in
 New
 York


City.


Count
 me
 in.
 I'm
 hooked.
 I'm
 hooked.
 I


have
 one
 silly
 quick
 question,
 but
 Wyth,


his
 name,
 is
 he
 named
 after
 NC
 Wyth
 the


painter?


I
 mean,
 that
 seems
 like
 the
 obvious


choice.
 And
 in
 fact,
 I
 didn't
 really


think
 of
 that
 until
 a
 friend
 pointed
 out


to
 me,
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 I've
 written


about
 a
 painter
 and
 I've
 named
 that


painter
 Wyth
 in
 America
 in
 New
 York
 of


all
 places.
 But
 no,
 he's
 named
 after


Mariah
 Wyth
 from
 a
 Joan
 Ddian
 novel
 from


Play
 It
 As
 Lays,
 I
 believe
 it
 is.
 And


I've
 always
 really
 loved
 that.
 I've


always
 really
 loved
 that
 name.
 And
 I


have
 this
 habit
 of
 naming
 my
 characters


after
 after
 other
 characters
 in
 other


people's
 books.


I
 kind
 of
 love
 this.
 Is
 Kading
 named


after
 anyone?


Well,
 he's
 named
 that
 name
 I've
 been


trying
 to
 stick
 on
 a
 character
 for
 a


long
 time,
 but
 really
 that
 name
 first


came
 to
 me
 from
 watching
 How
 to
 Get
 Away


with
 Murder.
 Analise
 Keing.
 It's
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 characters.
 And
 I
 just
 love


that
 name.
 I'm
 going
 to
 slap
 that
 name


on.


It's
 a
 great
 name.


Even
 in
 my
 first
 book,
 Wallace
 is
 named


people
 thought
 it
 was
 like
 Wallace


Stegner,
 but
 it
 was
 in
 fact
 Wallace


named
 after
 a
 character
 in
 Anne


Patchet's
 Commonwealth.
 So,
 I
 just
 have


this
 terrible
 sickness
 of
 loving
 female


characters.


What
 is
 it
 that
 like
 Lady
 Gaga
 says


where
 it's
 not
 afraid
 to
 reference
 or
 be


referenced?
 Is
 that
 Lady
 Gaga?


Yes,
 I
 love
 that.
 Yeah,
 that's
 me.


That's
 me
 out
 here
 riffing,
 referencing.


Well,
 with
 that
 out
 of
 the
 way,
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 officially
 ask
 a
 more
 serious


question,
 which
 is
 this
 book.
 I'm


wondering


where
 did
 the
 inspiration
 come
 from?
 Can


you
 tell
 us
 about
 that
 first
 seed
 of
 an


idea?
 What
 that
 was
 that
 then
 later


evolved
 into
 this
 book,
 Minor
 Black


Figures?
 What
 was
 the
 start?
 Sure.
 This


book,
 unlike
 some
 of
 my
 other
 books,


maybe
 this
 book
 has
 like
 a
 really


definite
 starting
 place
 because
 I
 was


under
 contract
 to
 write
 a
 different
 book


and
 that
 book
 was
 called
 Group
 Show
 and


was
 going
 to
 be
 about
 a
 Midwestern
 art


museum
 in
 the
 Midwest
 and
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 like
 big
 multi-
 character
 cast


decades
 spanning.
 And
 I
 kept
 writing
 137


pages
 of
 that
 book
 and
 throwing
 it
 away


over
 like
 a
 period
 of
 5
 years.
 Wow.
 I


even
 got
 a
 fellowship
 at
 the
 New
 York


Public
 Library
 to
 research
 that
 book
 and


to
 work
 on
 it.
 And
 after
 a
 period
 of


about
 like
 5
 years,
 I
 was
 just
 like


really
 stuck.
 I
 had
 137
 pages
 again.
 And


I
 was
 getting
 on
 a
 plane
 to
 go
 teach
 in


Paris
 in
 summer
 of
 2023.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


I
 cannot
 rewrite
 this
 book
 one
 more


time.
 And
 so
 I
 sent
 the
 137
 pages
 to
 my


editor
 and
 I
 said,
 I'm
 getting
 on
 a


plane.
 I
 won't
 have
 Wi-Fi
 for
 8
 hours.


can
 you
 read
 this
 and
 tell
 me
 if
 it's


good
 or
 bad
 just
 so
 that
 I
 know.
 And
 by


the
 time
 I'd
 landed
 in
 Paris,
 my
 editor


had
 written
 me
 a
 really
 long,
 really


beautiful
 email
 that
 essentially
 was


like,
 "You've
 never
 written
 better.
 The


writing
 is
 so
 good.
 I
 love
 this
 book.
 I


love
 it
 so
 much."
 And
 that
 was
 like


super
 clarifying
 for
 me
 because
 I


because
 it
 revealed
 to
 me
 that
 like
 the


reason
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 keep
 going
 with


the
 book
 was
 cuz
 I
 just
 didn't
 want
 to


write
 it
 anymore.


Interesting.


So,
 I
 threw
 it
 out.


So,
 you
 get
 this
 letter
 that
 says,
 "This


is
 great.
 you
 never
 and
 you're
 like
 it's


got
 to
 go.


Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 was
 just
 like
 I
 don't
 want


to
 write
 this
 book
 anymore
 and
 I
 threw


it
 out
 and
 did
 my
 teaching
 and
 then
 at


the
 end
 of
 that
 period
 I
 thought
 okay


I'm
 going
 to
 check
 into
 a
 hotel
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 book
 it
 for
 3
 weeks
 and
 by
 the


end
 of
 that
 3
 weeks
 I
 want
 to
 have
 the


next
 thing
 going.
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 like


what
 am
 I
 interested
 in?
 And
 I
 thought


I'd
 written
 a
 couple
 books
 that
 were


kind
 of
 severe
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 describe


things
 again
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 write
 about


light
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 write
 about
 a


priest
 and
 I
 thought
 what's
 going
 to
 let


me
 do
 that
 and
 I
 thought
 painters
 if
 if


I
 write
 a
 painter
 I'll
 get
 to
 describe


stuff
 just
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 natural
 course


of
 things
 and
 so
 I
 sat
 in
 that
 hotel
 and


by
 the
 time
 I
 left
 I'd
 written
 the
 first


hundred
 pages
 of
 the
 book.


What
 an
 origin
 story.
 That's
 kind
 of


incredible.


I
 mean
 utter
 utter
 insanity.
 It's,
 oh,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 saying
 that
 I've


written
 like
 137
 of
 the
 best
 pages
 I've


ever
 written.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 this


anymore.
 I'm
 going
 to
 like
 take
 the
 And


I
 told
 my
 editor,
 I'm
 going
 to
 throw


this
 away.
 And
 he
 said,
 leave.
 I'll


catch
 you.
 And
 I'm
 really
 thankful
 for


that
 because
 an
 editor
 is
 not
 often


going
 to
 be
 like,
 no,
 this
 is
 so
 good.


But
 he
 was
 like,
 go
 for
 it.
 I
 got
 your


back.
 And
 so
 then
 making
 Wyth
 a
 painter


was
 a
 way
 to
 get
 to
 write
 and
 describe.


But
 then
 also


when
 we
 see
 it
 in
 this
 book,
 the
 art


world
 itself
 is
 so
 robust
 and
 rich
 and


full
 and
 varied.


Can
 you
 talk
 to
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about


your
 deep
 dive
 into
 the
 art
 world
 and


how
 you
 brought
 that
 to
 the
 page?
 Yeah,


I
 I
 was
 always
 so
 interested
 in
 like
 art


world
 parties
 because
 it's
 often
 like
 an


easy
 target
 for
 like
 caricature
 in
 film


and
 TV
 when
 they
 want
 to
 show
 oh


someone's
 an
 elite
 or
 whatever
 they'll


have
 them
 go
 to
 like
 a
 gallery
 show.


There's
 that
 sort
 of
 Sex
 in
 the
 City


reboot
 and
 just
 like
 that
 which
 sort
 of


makes
 a
 much
 of
 Charlotte's
 involvement


in
 the
 art
 world
 and
 those
 are
 my


favorite
 scenes
 honestly.
 They're
 like


so
 dishy
 and
 I
 myself
 have
 found
 myself


going
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 gallery
 parties
 just


living
 in
 New
 York.
 You
 sometimes
 your


friend
 texts
 you,
 hey,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 go


to
 this?
 And
 you
 in
 fact
 do
 cuz
 it's


Thursday
 and
 there's
 nothing
 else
 to
 do.


But
 I
 thought,
 okay,
 there's
 that
 part


of
 it,
 but
 I
 also
 want
 to
 dig
 deeper


here
 and
 just
 figure
 out
 what
 are
 people


thinking
 and
 feeling
 when
 they
 leave
 the


party
 and
 when
 they
 go
 home.
 And
 so
 I
 I


went
 to
 the
 past.
 I
 read
 this
 really


wonderful
 book
 called
 Fierce
 Ambition
 by


Alexander
 Nimmerov
 that
 it's
 a
 biography


of
 Helen
 Frankenthaler.
 I
 read
 Ninth


Street
 Women,
 which
 is
 another
 really


great
 biography.
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of


biographies.
 I
 read
 the
 multi
 volume


series
 of
 biographies
 about
 Lucy
 and


Freud
 and
 because
 I
 was
 interested
 in


like
 the
 artist
 lives,
 yes,
 but
 I
 was


interested
 in
 like
 the
 social
 network
 of


it
 all.
 I
 was
 interested
 in
 how
 the


journalists
 fit
 together
 with
 the


reviewers
 and
 how
 they
 fit
 together
 with


the
 critics
 and
 how
 they
 fit
 together


with
 the
 artists
 cuz
 they're
 often


friends
 and
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.
 And
 so


a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 informed
 by
 my
 own
 sort


of
 gadf
 flying
 about
 parties,
 but
 it


also
 came
 from
 I
 did
 this
 deep
 dive
 into


art
 biographies
 and
 read
 about
 so
 many


parties.
 So
 many
 juicy
 parties.


It
 sounds
 like
 fun
 research,
 too.
 Like


you
 mentioned
 Sex
 in
 the
 City.
 Now


you're
 getting
 to
 read
 about
 parties


that
 happened
 in
 the
 past,
 real
 parties.


You
 watching
 fictional
 parties.


Yes.
 And
 on
 the
 mess
 the
 mess
 of
 their


personal
 lives
 and
 how
 it
 like
 spill


over
 into
 the
 public.
 It
 was
 so


delicious.
 It
 was
 insane
 but
 really
 fun.


You
 just
 mentioned
 something
 that
 I


found
 really
 interesting
 I
 wanted
 to


follow
 up
 on,
 which
 is
 you
 said
 the
 word


social
 world,
 and
 that
 is
 something
 that


I
 think
 comes
 through
 the
 start
 of
 this


book
 immediately
 and
 I
 want
 to
 read
 I


guess
 from
 the
 first
 chapter.
 Is
 it


always
 weird
 to
 hear
 someone
 read
 back


to
 you?


I'm
 looking
 forward
 to
 it
 actually.


You
 write
 that
 summer
 they
 threw
 bombs


and
 made
 signs
 for
 peace.
 They
 went
 into


the
 streets
 and
 the
 parks
 and
 the


squares
 the
 same
 as
 they
 had
 done
 two


years
 before
 and
 three
 years
 before
 that


and
 six
 years
 before
 that
 and
 three


years
 before
 that
 which
 of
 course
 meant


that
 they
 had
 never
 really
 left
 the


streets
 and
 the
 parks
 and
 the
 squares
 in


the
 first
 place.
 There
 was
 a
 president


in
 Washington
 and
 nine
 Supreme
 Court


justices.
 There
 was
 a
 war
 in
 Europe.


There
 was
 not
 yet
 a
 war
 in
 America


because
 America
 fought
 its
 wars


elsewhere.
 And
 it
 goes
 on
 and
 you


immediately
 start
 by
 creating
 this


social
 political
 scene.


You
 mentioned
 wanting
 to
 write
 about


painting
 and
 seeing,
 but
 then
 this
 is


how
 we
 start.
 I
 really
 strugg
 not


struggled,
 maybe
 that's
 not
 the
 right


word,
 but
 the
 book
 had
 a
 different


opening
 and
 it
 started
 much
 more
 in


scene
 and
 it
 started
 with
 Wyth


complaining
 about
 this
 bad
 art
 show
 he'd


been
 to.
 And
 I
 was
 just
 I
 I
 need
 more


scope.
 I
 need
 more
 scale
 because
 if
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 book
 about
 a
 painter


struggling
 to
 make
 art,
 I
 have
 to
 dig


deep
 down
 into
 the
 roots
 of
 that


struggle.
 And
 it's
 not
 just
 like
 his


personal
 stuff.
 It's
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


the
 unique
 collision
 of
 his
 personal


experiences
 with
 the
 social
 and


historical
 climate
 that
 determines
 what


it
 is
 to
 make
 art
 at
 a
 particular
 time.


And
 I
 can't
 smuggle
 that
 in
 if
 I'm


starting
 with
 him
 just
 in
 scene.
 And
 I


wanted
 it
 to
 also
 reflect
 what
 it
 is
 to


like
 try
 to
 take
 stock
 of
 your
 time
 and


your
 era
 and
 how
 can
 I
 do
 that
 if
 the


book
 isn't
 also
 willing
 to
 admit
 those


things
 into
 itself.
 So
 I
 went
 back
 and
 I


rewrote
 the
 opening
 with
 this
 grander


almost
 a
 Kenzian
 sweep
 because
 that
 is


what
 Wyth
 is
 trying
 to
 capture.
 He's


trying
 to
 capture
 the
 moment.
 And
 so


he's
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 the
 moment.


And
 if
 the
 book
 is
 a
 record
 of
 all
 that


he
 sees
 and
 feels
 and
 experiences
 and


what
 he
 thinks
 of
 it,
 then
 I've
 got
 to


show
 the
 reader
 that
 as
 well.
 If
 you


want
 to
 show
 someone
 swimming,
 you
 have


to
 create
 the
 water.


Yes.
 And


precisely.
 That's
 so
 good.
 You
 mentioned


sweep
 and
 you
 do
 get
 that
 sense
 of
 Yeah.


Here
 is
 the
 scene
 overall
 and
 almost
 I


feel
 like
 I'm
 not
 in
 film
 at
 all,
 but
 I


feel
 like
 you
 could
 see
 the
 camera
 zoom


down.
 Here's
 the
 scene
 and
 it
 zooms
 into


Wyth.
 And
 for
 the
 purposes
 of
 this


conversation,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 also
 zoom


into
 Wyth.
 Can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 this
 character?
 Who
 is
 he?


Tell
 us
 more
 about
 him.


Yeah,
 Sir
 Wyth
 is
 black,
 biracial,
 but


for
 his
 purposes,
 he
 is
 black
 and
 he


grew
 up
 in
 Virginia
 and
 he's
 always


wanted
 to
 be
 an
 artist,
 but
 he's
 always


also
 felt
 estranged
 from
 basically


everyone
 around
 him.
 and
 he
 goes
 to
 art


school
 at
 a
 really
 pivotal
 time
 in


American
 history.
 He
 goes
 to
 art
 school


around
 the
 murder
 of
 Tamir
 Rice.
 And
 so


that
 is
 the
 formative
 social
 backdrop
 of


his
 aesthetic
 education.
 And
 almost
 from


the
 very
 beginning,
 he
 feels
 this
 clash


between
 his
 aesthetics
 and
 the
 political


veillances
 that
 are
 being
 projected
 onto


his
 work
 by
 by
 his
 peers,
 white
 and


black.
 And
 so
 he's
 never
 felt
 quite
 sure


about
 what
 to
 do,
 how
 to
 resolve
 this


tension
 between
 the
 aesthetic
 and
 the


political.
 Many
 such
 cases.
 So
 many
 such


cases.
 And
 so
 now
 he's
 molted
 into


adulthood.
 He's
 out
 of
 grad
 school.
 He's


firmly
 living
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 he
 is
 in


search
 of
 meaning
 and
 but
 he
 isn't
 sure


that
 meaning
 exists
 in
 the
 world


anymore.
 And
 he
 isn't
 sure
 that
 he
 wants


the
 things
 that
 he
 wants
 for
 the
 right


reasons.
 And
 so
 he's
 always
 turning
 them


over
 and
 inspecting
 his
 ambitions
 and


his
 motivations
 in
 this
 like
 sometimes


like
 endlessly
 recursive
 self-defeating


spiral.


I
 found
 Wyth
 to
 be
 so
 smart
 and


searching
 and
 hurt
 and
 messy
 and


determined.


He
 felt
 so
 full
 as
 a
 character.


You
 you
 mentioned
 at
 the
 start
 that
 you


wanted
 to
 write
 about
 painting
 and


seeing
 and
 priests
 and
 yet
 you
 just


described
 Wyth.
 You
 mentioned
 all
 of


these
 very
 deep
 existential


ideas.
 When
 I
 think
 about
 what
 the
 book


is
 about
 at
 its
 like
 simplest
 level
 to


me
 it
 is
 about
 two
 people
 with
 a


vocation
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 it


means
 to
 have
 a
 vocation
 in
 a
 world
 that


seems
 so
 evacuated
 of
 meaning
 and


structure.
 And
 can
 you
 pursue
 a
 vocation


in
 a
 world
 like
 the
 one
 we
 have
 now?
 Is


it
 possible
 to
 sell
 out
 in
 a
 world
 that


is
 already
 bought
 and
 sold
 by
 the
 sort


of
 various
 powers
 that
 be?
 And
 I
 think


yeah,
 Wyth
 as
 a
 painter
 is
 at
 a
 crisis


of
 faith
 in
 in
 what
 it
 is
 that
 he's


doing
 because
 he
 feels
 like
 he's
 come
 to


the
 end
 of
 one
 form
 of
 value
 in
 his


painting.
 you
 know,
 he
 loves
 to
 paint


these
 various
 tableau
 where
 he
 inserts


black
 people.
 And
 he
 at
 the
 start
 of
 the


book,
 we
 find
 him
 losing
 faith
 in
 that


as
 like
 an
 artistic
 practice.
 And
 he's


like,
 "Well,
 what
 else
 is
 there?"
 And


he's,
 "Should
 I
 try
 to
 be
 political?"


And
 he's,
 "What
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 be


political
 in
 your
 art?"
 And
 I
 feel
 like


I've
 been
 told
 my
 whole
 life
 that
 I


shouldn't
 be
 political
 in
 my
 art,
 that


my
 art
 should
 just
 be
 about
 beauty
 and


truth
 and
 expressing
 all
 this
 other


stuff.
 And
 he
 just
 like
 doesn't
 know


what
 to
 make
 of
 any
 of
 it,
 right?
 And
 so


the
 book
 is
 charting
 his
 in
 some
 sense


the
 end
 of
 his
 artistic
 naive
 and
 his


development
 into
 a
 mature
 artistic


consciousness
 which
 is
 also
 just
 the


maturation
 of
 a
 person
 like
 how
 we
 all


reach
 that
 end
 of
 very
 late
 adolescence


when
 we
 finally
 just
 have
 to
 stand
 up


and
 like
 be
 an
 adult
 in
 the
 world
 and


that
 is
 like
 a
 singularly
 harrowing


moment
 that
 comes
 for
 us
 all.
 How
 do
 you


put
 that
 in
 a
 novel?
 This
 is
 so


conceptual
 and
 I
 I
 said
 the
 word


existential
 before
 I
 say
 it
 again,


existential
 and
 yet


this
 is
 a
 novel.
 We
 have a
 story
 and
 we


have
 this
 character
 and
 we
 have
 their


own
 journey.
 Can
 you
 tell
 me
 a
 little


bit
 about
 your
 process
 of


having
 that
 conversation
 in
 this
 form?


Yeah.
 Well,
 so
 my
 process
 used
 to
 look


very
 different.
 It
 used
 to
 just
 look


like
 I
 would
 I
 would
 just
 write
 scenes


and
 then
 try
 to
 extrapolate
 from
 that


some
 deeper
 meaning
 or
 whatever.
 But
 in


between
 writing
 my
 last
 novel,
 the
 late


Americans,
 and
 writing
 this
 book,
 I
 read


a
 great
 deal
 of
 political,
 social,
 and


literary
 theory,
 especially
 this
 one


critic,
 Gayorg
 Glucos.
 And
 Lucash,
 his


whole
 program
 of
 realism
 is
 that
 it's


all
 about
 distilling
 things
 down
 to


their
 most
 emblematic
 moments.
 And
 so


taking
 the
 existential
 and
 then
 trying


to
 figure
 out
 what
 is
 the
 moment
 in
 this


character's
 life
 that
 most
 clearly
 and


keenly
 and
 most
 urgently
 expresses
 all


of
 their
 problems
 because
 that
 is
 the


place
 where
 in
 expressing
 that


character's
 particular
 urgencies,
 you're


also
 expressing
 the
 particular
 urgencies


of
 their
 time.
 And
 so
 for
 this
 book,
 it


was
 okay,
 he's
 in
 crisis,
 whatever
 that


means.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 write
 a
 woo
 woo


mushy
 book.
 What
 are
 the
 moments
 and


situations
 that
 most
 keenly
 express
 that


crisis
 and
 then
 leaning
 into
 full-on


dramatizing
 those
 moments?
 He's
 got
 to


be
 looking
 at
 his
 bad
 paintings
 and


being
 this
 is
 not
 enough.
 And
 then
 he's


got
 to
 go
 into
 the
 world
 and
 see
 some


art
 he
 hates
 and
 be
 like,
 "That's
 not
 it


either."
 And
 then
 he's
 got
 to
 encounter


someone
 who's
 going
 to
 press
 him
 on
 all


of
 his
 ideals
 in
 all
 these
 different


ways.
 So
 when
 he's
 in
 the
 studio,
 the


people
 pressing
 him
 are
 his
 friends,
 his


peers,
 his
 studio
 mates.
 Well,
 he's
 not


always
 in
 the
 studio,
 right?
 he's
 got


this
 other
 job
 as
 an
 art
 restorer
 and
 so


those
 people
 will
 press
 him
 from
 one


angle
 and
 then
 he
 meets
 this
 guy
 who
 he


maybe
 feels
 something
 really
 intense
 for


and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 different
 set


of
 questions.
 I
 guess
 like
 I
 was
 trying


to
 just
 demonstrate
 how
 the
 social


process
 works
 its
 way
 out
 through
 our


relationships
 cuz
 like
 ultimately
 to
 me


a
 novel
 is
 about
 relationships


and
 you
 just
 mentioned
 he
 has
 this


relationship
 with
 someone
 else.
 He
 meets


this
 guy
 and
 I
 want
 to
 pivot
 to
 talk


about
 him.


I've
 had
 this
 long-standing
 fascination


with
 Catholicism.
 I'm
 obsessed
 with


Catholicism
 and
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 European


history
 and
 so
 you
 cannot
 read
 about


European
 history
 and
 not
 read
 about


Catholicism.
 Yep.


And
 I
 was
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go
 for
 it.


I'm
 going
 to
 write
 about
 a
 Jesuit.
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 for
 it.
 Who's
 going
 to
 stop


me?
 I'm
 going to
 write
 about
 a
 Jesuit


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 like
 put
 him
 in
 this


novel.
 And
 so
 the
 guy
 that
 you
 know
 at


the
 same
 time
 that
 W
 is
 having
 a
 crisis


of
 faith
 in
 a
 more
 secular
 way,
 there's


this
 guy
 who's
 trained
 his
 entire
 life


to
 be
 a
 priest
 who's
 also
 having
 a


crisis
 of
 faith.
 and
 they
 meet
 and
 they


intersect
 in
 the
 city
 at
 this
 very


particular
 moment
 in
 time
 and
 they


pressurize
 each
 other
 in
 these
 really


interesting
 ways.
 But
 writing
 Keing
 was


just
 an
 excuse
 to
 I
 don't
 know
 write
 my


own
 version
 of
 a
 Norah
 Efron
 movie.


Maybe
 I
 love
 romance
 novels
 and
 I
 love


romantic
 comedies
 and
 I'd
 always
 wanted


to
 write
 one
 and
 I
 thought
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 my
 chance
 to
 write
 my
 favorite


genre
 of
 story
 where
 people
 walk
 and


talk
 themselves
 into
 love
 where
 they


talk
 about
 all
 the
 sort
 of
 heady


questions
 while
 giving
 each
 other
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 hard
 time
 and
 come
 to


know
 each
 other
 better
 through
 their


their
 riffing
 and
 their
 banter
 and
 in


knowing
 each
 other
 better
 aren't
 totally


turned
 off
 by
 what
 they
 see.
 And
 I
 think


like
 the
 romantic
 comedy
 is
 the
 ultimate


optimistic
 art
 form
 because
 it
 it
 posits


that
 two
 people
 who
 come
 to
 know
 each


other
 won't
 be
 turned
 off
 or
 repulsed


and
 will
 in
 fact
 want
 greater
 intimacy.


And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 most
 optimistic


statement
 about
 the
 human
 condition
 that


we
 have.
 That's
 wild.
 And
 it's
 the


opposite
 I
 think
 of
 all
 my
 other
 books.


And
 so
 when
 writing
 this
 I
 was
 I'm
 going


to
 get
 to
 write
 two
 people
 walking


around
 New
 York
 City
 and
 talking
 and


falling
 in
 love.
 What
 is
 not
 to
 like?
 H.


And
 so
 whenever
 I
 was
 deep
 in
 an
 edit
 or


deep
 in
 a
 revision
 struggling,
 I
 was


this
 is
 your
 Norah
 Efron
 moment.
 Find


the
 bliss.
 Find
 the
 joy
 in
 it.
 I
 kind
 of


love
 this
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 the


Keading
 and
 Wyth
 relationship
 just
 did


feel
 so
 fun.
 You
 mentioned
 they're


walking
 around
 and
 talking,
 but
 they're


also
 having
 these
 deep
 philosophical


conversations
 over
 so
 many
 cigarettes


and
 then
 they're
 making
 out
 and
 then


they're
 talking
 about
 religion
 and
 art


and
 then
 they're
 smoking
 again
 and


they're
 making
 out
 again
 and
 then
 they


go
 away
 and
 then
 they're
 thinking
 about


each
 other
 and
 then
 they
 come
 back.
 And


what
 I
 loved
 about
 that
 relationship,
 in


addition
 to
 it
 just
 being
 very
 fun
 to


read,
 is
 that
 it
 added
 this
 other


texture
 to
 this
 book
 where
 this
 book
 is


so
 cerebral
 and
 they
 have
 such
 a


physical
 chemistry
 in
 addition
 to
 that


cerebral
 and
 spiritual
 bond.


Yeah.
 I'm
 so
 glad
 that
 you
 that
 you
 feel


that
 way
 because
 certainly
 in
 my
 own


life,
 some
 of
 the
 most
 intense


relationships
 that
 I've
 had,
 romantic
 or


platonic,
 have
 come
 about
 because
 I've


had
 one
 of
 those
 allnight
 first


conversations
 with
 someone
 where
 you're


talking
 about
 everything
 under
 the
 sun


and
 you're
 turning
 over
 all
 the
 rocks


and
 you're
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 gosh,
 that's
 so


funny.
 You're
 so
 funny.
 I
 love
 this.
 I


can't
 get
 enough
 of
 this.
 I
 want
 to
 talk


to
 you
 again
 and
 again
 and
 again."
 And


and
 so
 to
 me,
 I
 guess
 that's
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 wanted
 to
 write
 into
 the
 book


was
 just
 this
 sense
 of
 falling
 for


someone
 because
 of
 their
 ideas,
 because


of
 what
 they
 have
 to
 say,
 but
 at
 the


same
 time,
 it
 is
 physical,
 but
 that
 the


two
 often
 go
 together.
 They
 often
 feed


each
 other.
 And
 that
 an
 initial
 physical


spark
 is
 sometimes
 deepened
 when
 you


discover,
 oh,
 this
 person
 knows
 so
 much


about
 French
 lit
 or
 like
 this
 person


knows
 so
 there.
 Yeah.
 Like
 when
 you
 find


out
 there's
 weird
 stuff.
 Oh,
 this
 person


knows
 so
 much
 about
 this
 random
 corner


of
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 love
 that.
 Yeah.


Tell
 me
 more.


They
 know
 so
 much
 about
 French
 lit
 and


that
 is
 so
 attractive.


Yeah.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Or
 the
 wrist.
 Oh,
 your


wrist
 is
 so
 Oh,
 like
 it's
 Yeah.


What
 were
 you
 thinking
 about
 as
 you
 were


balancing
 those
 two
 approaches
 and
 those


two
 tones
 in
 the
 novel?
 This
 I
 guess
 you


mentioned
 you
 wanted
 to
 write
 a
 light


book,
 but
 then
 Wyth
 is
 really
 grappling


with
 pain
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 heavy
 stuff,
 too.


And


I
 think
 I
 was
 just
 in
 pursuit
 of
 what


Luc
 borrowing
 from
 Hegel
 calls
 the


totality.
 And
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 symbol
 a


totality
 of
 a
 life,
 which
 is
 to
 say
 that


it
 I
 felt
 that
 in
 order
 to
 tell
 the


truth
 with
 the
 book,
 it
 had
 to
 have


joking
 around
 with
 his
 friend
 Bernard


and
 them
 riffing
 on
 Jane
 Air
 and
 the


trope
 of
 the
 tragic
 Mulatto.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 it
 had
 to
 have
 these
 deep
 dives
 on


Sergeant.
 And
 it
 had
 to
 have
 this


methodical
 researching
 process.
 He
 goes


in
 search
 of
 a
 lost
 artist
 as
 well.
 And


it
 had
 to
 have
 that.
 and
 it
 had
 to
 have


the
 melancholy
 over
 watching
 his


mother's
 burgeoning
 mommy
 blogger
 fame.


The
 details
 of
 her
 story
 are
 very


amusing
 and
 painful.


Painful,
 but
 I
 I
 will
 say
 that
 I
 did


delight
 in
 getting
 to
 think
 of
 this


woman
 who's
 Anyway,
 it
 also
 had
 to
 have


this
 love
 story
 at
 the
 center
 of
 it,


right?
 And
 that
 it
 had
 to
 have
 all
 of


that.
 And
 I
 think
 in
 some
 ways
 the
 book


was
 me
 assembling
 various
 things
 that
 I


found
 a
 great
 deal
 in
 pleasure
 in


contemplating
 like
 French
 cinema
 and


painting
 and
 light
 changing
 on
 a
 wall


and
 methodical
 processes
 of
 like
 art


restoration.


But
 all
 of
 my
 delight
 in
 it
 that
 doesn't


mean
 anything
 if
 it
 doesn't
 cohhere
 into


life,
 right?
 And
 so
 the
 hardest
 part
 was


just
 looking
 for
 all
 of
 the
 places
 where


the
 seams
 could
 come
 together
 in
 a
 way


that
 felt
 true
 and
 authentic
 and
 letting


the
 book
 meander
 and
 find
 its
 own
 shape


because
 otherwise
 it's
 going
 to
 feel


like
 quite
 forced
 if
 I'm
 gluing
 this


disquisition
 on
 Sergeant
 on
 top
 of
 a


long
 thing
 about
 lithography
 or


whatever.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


And
 we're
 back.
 I'm
 MJ
 Franklin.
 I'm
 an


editor
 here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book


Review
 and
 I'm
 talking
 to
 the
 author


Brandon
 Taylor
 about
 his
 new
 book,
 Minor


Black
 Figures.
 In
 this
 book,
 you
 are


reading
 this
 story
 and
 you're
 just
 swept


up
 in
 Wyatt's
 life
 and
 its
 challenges


and
 the
 development
 of
 this
 relationship


and
 then
 you
 do
 get
 long
 passages
 about


classical
 music
 or
 meditations
 on
 art.


And
 what
 I
 really
 appreciated
 is
 that
 it


felt
 like
 this
 was
 a
 book
 that
 really


respected
 the
 reader,
 that
 didn't
 hold


the
 reader's
 hands
 as
 it
 introduced
 them


to
 a
 variety
 of
 interesting,
 thoughtful


topics
 and
 interesting
 meditations
 on


art.
 And
 I
 feel
 that
 something
 about


that
 just
 felt
 very
 refreshing
 just
 to


feel
 that
 respect
 radiating
 through
 the


pages.
 And
 yet
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 also
 in


a
 way
 is
 a
 type
 of
 bravery
 of
 saying


will
 the
 reader
 follow
 me
 down
 this


path.
 I
 agree
 that
 it
 is
 a
 a
 faith
 in


the
 reader
 and
 it
 is
 a
 faith
 in
 the


novel
 as
 a
 form.
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 a


moment
 where
 everyone
 has
 an
 opinion


about
 the
 contemporary
 novel
 and
 what


ails
 it
 and
 what
 plagues
 it
 and
 we're


always
 complaining
 about
 it
 being
 made


ever
 sleeker
 and
 ever
 more
 efficient
 and


ever
 more
 cinematic.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 the
 novel
 is
 dead.
 Fiction
 is


over.
 If
 it's
 dead,
 why
 are
 we
 still


complaining
 about
 like
 it
 there?
 All


there
 everyone
 has
 a
 thought
 about,


well,
 the
 contemporary
 novel
 can't
 do


anymore.
 Okay,
 maybe.
 But
 when
 you
 read


Dickens,
 when
 you
 read
 Zolah,
 when
 you


read
 Flo,
 when
 you
 read
 George
 Elliot,


when
 you
 read
 Jane
 Austin,
 don't
 you


want
 to
 try
 that
 stuff?
 Like
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 19th
 century
 novel,
 it's
 so


much
 more
 varied
 and
 so
 much
 more
 alive


and
 so
 much
 stranger
 than
 I
 think
 people


remember.
 And
 I
 was
 reading
 a
 lot
 of


Zullah
 right
 around
 the
 time
 that
 I
 was


getting
 ready
 to
 write
 this.
 And
 I


thought,
 I'm
 just
 gonna
 I'm
 just
 gonna


remind
 myself
 and
 readers
 of
 all
 that
 a


novel
 can
 be
 and
 what
 it
 can
 do.
 And


there
 were
 moments
 where
 my
 agent,
 like


with
 the
 opening,
 my
 agent
 was
 like,


"Maybe
 we
 make
 it
 more
 efficient.
 Maybe


we
 get
 in
 scene
 sooner."
 The
 line,
 I


think
 I've
 written
 about
 this
 elsewhere,


but
 the
 line
 I
 I
 told
 her
 was,
 "Well,
 it


is
 a
 novel.
 The
 reader
 should
 have
 to


read
 it."
 And
 reminding
 readers
 that,


"Oh,
 yeah,
 a
 book
 can
 contain
 all
 these


really
 wonderful
 trap
 doors
 that
 drop


you
 down
 inside."
 And
 but
 I
 do
 think


having
 faith
 in
 the
 reader
 is
 one
 thing,


but
 also
 respecting
 the
 reader
 and


respecting
 their
 attention
 so
 that
 even


if
 you're
 getting
 a
 disquisition
 about


Sergeant,
 you're
 learning
 something


about
 Wyth
 and
 how
 he
 sees
 the
 world
 and


that
 it
 will
 influence
 how
 he
 interacts


with
 the
 world
 going
 forward.
 And
 so
 I


have
 great
 faith
 in
 the
 reader
 that


they're
 going
 to
 follow
 me.
 Maybe
 they


will,
 maybe
 they
 won't.
 I
 hope
 they
 will


come
 with
 me.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 hold
 you


for
 too
 long.
 And
 it's
 it's
 going
 to
 be


worth
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 was
 about


making
 every
 discursion
 feel
 worth
 it.


We
 are
 now
 in
 my
 favorite
 territory


which
 is
 the
 state
 of
 the
 novel
 and
 the


defense
 of
 the
 novel.
 And
 that
 leads
 me


to
 a
 question
 that
 I
 had
 which
 is
 so


Wyth
 is
 a
 painter.


He
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 literary
 thoughts
 though


and
 a
 lot
 of
 thoughts
 about
 music
 but


Wyth
 is
 a
 painter.
 However,
 reading


this,
 it
 felt
 like
 this
 was
 also
 a


commentary
 on
 the
 criticism
 and


responses
 and
 reception
 to
 your
 books


that
 you've
 received.
 Is
 that
 fair
 to


say?
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Wyth
 is


really
 grappling
 with,
 for
 instance,
 is


whether
 or
 not
 people
 feel
 like
 his


portrayals
 of
 real
 life
 feel
 real.
 And


he
 wants
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 paint
 real


life.
 And
 that
 phrase
 comes
 up
 a
 lot.


And
 that
 is
 also
 the
 title
 of
 your
 first


book.
 So,
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a
 way
 that


the
 book
 is
 inviting
 you
 to
 make
 those


comparisons.
 And
 I'm
 wondering


why
 write
 about
 this
 the
 philosophy
 and


ethics
 of
 art
 making
 and
 art
 perception


through
 painting
 rather
 than
 making
 Wyth


a
 writer.


Yeah.


First
 of
 all,
 it
 was
 just
 I
 wanted
 to


write
 about
 a
 painter.
 I'd
 written
 some


books
 that
 were
 very
 severe
 and
 I


allowed
 myself
 a
 very
 minimal


descriptive
 budget.
 what's
 going
 to
 let


me
 execute
 the
 most
 description?
 I
 just


need
 to
 describe
 stuff
 cuz
 again
 I've


been
 reading
 these
 19th
 century
 novels


which
 are
 full
 of
 description.
 I
 was


like
 you
 can't
 do
 you
 in
 order
 to


smuggle
 that
 in
 you
 need
 a
 reason.
 I
 was


like
 a
 painter
 would
 give
 me
 a
 great


pretext
 for
 it.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 the


reason
 that
 it's
 painting
 and
 not
 pros


is
 like
 a
 similar
 reason
 that
 it's


painting
 instead
 of
 photography.
 I
 mean


there's
 some
 photography
 in
 the
 book
 but


there's
 something
 about
 painting
 which


feels
 very
 close
 to
 to
 pros
 literature


which
 is
 that
 it
 it
 can
 never
 give
 an


exact
 replica
 of
 life
 and
 so
 at
 the
 same


time
 it's
 not
 trying
 to
 do
 that.
 It's


only
 ever
 offering
 a
 sort
 of
 very


subjective
 view
 of
 the
 world
 and
 those


resonances
 feel
 so
 dear
 to
 me
 as
 a


thinker
 and
 as
 a
 as
 an
 artist.
 And
 so


for
 that
 reason,
 as
 was
 my
 sort
 of
 venal


desire
 to
 write
 about
 the
 materiality
 of


painting,
 but
 it
 also
 just
 feels
 like


any
 black
 artist
 making
 art
 today,
 no


matter
 the
 medium
 or
 the
 form,
 is


confronted
 with
 a
 set
 of
 difficulties


and
 that
 our
 work
 is
 measured
 against


some
 sort
 of
 external
 perception
 of
 what


real
 black
 life
 is.
 And
 so
 even
 if


you're
 a
 fantasist,
 they're
 reading
 it


for
 the
 commentary
 on
 black
 life,
 even


if
 you
 yourself
 have
 no
 commentary
 to


make
 therein.
 And
 that
 tension
 feels


alive
 no
 matter
 the
 genre
 or
 the
 form.


And
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 it's


painting
 is
 that
 it
 was
 the
 most


expedient
 because
 it
 let
 me
 describe


stuff
 and
 also
 I
 still
 get
 to
 pursue


these
 questions
 which
 are
 so
 active
 in


my
 own
 life
 in
 a
 way.
 And
 can
 we
 dig


into
 some
 of
 those
 questions?
 And


specifically,
 I
 want
 to
 pose
 the
 dilemma


that
 and
 frustration
 that
 Wyth
 has
 as
 it


appears
 in
 the
 book,
 which
 is
 Wyth
 wants


to
 paint
 beautiful
 lush
 scenes
 of
 people


wearing
 sweaters,
 fraught
 relationships,


considering
 things.
 He
 is
 painting


stills
 from
 movies
 and
 instead
 of
 and
 he


swapped
 the
 white
 figures
 from
 those


stills
 with
 black
 figures.
 That's
 one


thing
 that
 he's
 doing.
 But
 one
 of
 his


frustrations
 is
 that
 he
 could
 paint


anything
 and
 people
 will
 feel


differently
 about
 it
 because
 not
 of


what's
 in
 the
 painting
 but
 who
 he
 is
 as


a
 painter,
 which
 is
 to
 say
 a
 black


painter.
 And
 there's
 a
 really
 rich


conversation
 in
 the
 book
 with
 that.
 Wyth


has
 a
 series
 of
 ideas,


other
 characters
 talk
 to
 him
 about
 it,


challenge
 him
 on
 that.
 Can
 you
 talk
 to


me
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 just
 that


conversation
 as
 it
 appears
 in
 the
 book


about
 race,
 about
 perception?
 We
 talked


about
 the
 ethics
 of
 art
 making,
 but
 also


about
 the
 ethics
 of
 perceiving
 art.


This
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of
 a
 thing
 we


were
 talking
 about
 earlier,
 which
 is


like
 how
 do
 you
 put
 it
 in
 a
 novel,


right?
 Because
 these
 are
 ideas
 that
 I've


wrestled
 with,
 that
 I've
 grappled
 with


for
 a
 long,
 long
 time.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 could


put
 it
 in
 a
 book
 where
 he's
 just
 sitting


moodily
 thinking
 about
 what
 it
 means
 to


be
 a
 black
 artist.
 Yeah,
 but
 nobody


nobody
 wants
 to
 read
 that.


We
 need
 to
 make
 this
 readable
 and


interesting.


Yeah.
 Well,
 also
 that's
 an
 idea
 that


lives
 in
 isolation
 from
 the
 world.
 And


that
 might
 make
 an
 interesting


philosophical
 treatise,
 but
 how
 does
 it


intersect
 with
 this
 guy's
 life?
 Also,


how
 does
 it
 arrive
 out
 of
 his
 his
 lived


experience?
 And
 so,
 the
 best
 way
 to
 do


it
 is
 just
 have
 him
 argue
 about
 it
 with


other
 people.
 And
 so,
 as
 you
 say,
 he


talks
 about
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 And
 it


also
 felt
 important
 to
 me
 that
 to
 put


into
 conversation
 because
 I
 can
 have
 an


idea
 about
 why
 people
 project
 various


things
 onto
 my
 art
 and
 I
 can
 walk
 around


thinking
 that
 that
 is
 the
 correct
 idea


about
 that.
 But
 the
 minute
 it's
 in


conversation,
 it
 is
 then
 in
 in


conversation
 with
 someone
 else's
 ideas


and
 someone
 else's
 perceptions
 and
 it
 is


therefore
 challenged
 by
 those


alternative
 reads
 and
 it
 forces
 me
 to


rethink
 sometimes
 my
 own
 motivations
 for


thinking
 that.
 And
 so
 it
 felt
 important


also
 just
 to
 offer
 a
 variety
 of
 takes
 on


the
 idea
 of
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 a
 black


artist
 and
 how
 is
 black
 art
 evaluated?


How
 is
 black
 art
 judged?
 How
 is
 it


perceived
 even
 in
 in
 the
 world?
 Because


the
 way
 that
 I
 feel
 about
 it
 isn't
 the


way
 that
 this
 black
 artist
 feels
 or
 that


black
 artist
 feels.
 And
 so
 it
 would
 have


felt
 false
 to
 write
 a
 book
 about
 this


character
 lamenting
 the
 perception
 of


black
 art
 if
 the
 text
 itself
 didn't


admit
 that
 this
 is
 just
 one
 perspective.


I
 can't
 say
 this
 is
 a
 book
 about
 him


yearning
 for
 his
 subjectivity
 if
 I
 don't


do
 a
 great
 job
 of
 showing
 these
 external


limitations
 of
 that
 subjectivity
 cuz


then
 it's
 universal.
 So
 you've
 got
 to


put
 it
 in
 in
 in
 a
 context
 in
 like
 the


easiest
 way
 is
 just
 to
 have
 them
 argue


about
 it
 which
 I
 love.
 I
 love
 an


argument
 that
 distills
 what's
 happening


in
 this
 book
 which
 is
 big
 philosophical


lofty
 conversations.
 Let's
 have
 people


argue.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 art.
 Let's
 have


a
 painter.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 fraught


relationships.
 with
 a
 high
 priest.
 Yes.


Well,
 I
 could
 ask
 you
 questions
 about


this
 novel
 all
 day,
 but
 I
 have
 a
 few


panned
 out
 questions
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure


to
 get
 to.
 I
 want
 to
 pivot
 and
 talk
 to


you
 about
 just
 writing
 and
 your
 career


at
 large.
 We
 alluded
 to
 it
 earlier,
 but


you
 are
 up
 to
 so
 much.
 You
 are
 an


author.
 You
 are
 a
 professor.
 You
 are
 a


critic.
 And
 you've
 written
 for
 places


including
 the
 New
 Yorker,
 the
 New
 York


Times
 Book
 Review.
 You
 mentioned
 the


Sally
 Reini
 review.
 You
 are
 an
 acquiring


editor.
 You
 have
 a
 very
 popular


substack.
 You're
 doing
 so
 much.
 And
 I


feel
 because
 of
 that,
 you
 have
 a
 very


unique
 vantage
 point
 on
 the
 literary


world
 and
 the
 books
 industry.
 And
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 ask
 about
 that.
 And
 I
 guess
 to


start,
 I
 was
 wondering,
 have
 any
 of


those
 other
 jobs
 impacted
 your
 writing


or
 are
 they
 just
 completely
 separate
 for


you?
 M
 well
 I
 think
 definitely
 my


criticism
 that
 I
 write
 because
 it
 means


that
 I'm
 reading
 a
 lot
 and
 I'm
 reading
 a


lot
 of
 criticism
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to


before
 I
 offer
 an
 opinion
 about
 a
 book
 I


want
 to
 be
 versed
 in
 its
 themes
 and
 its


ideas
 and
 its
 ideologies
 and
 its


tradition.
 So
 that
 involves
 a
 lot
 of


background
 reading
 and
 that
 has
 come
 in


like
 a
 big
 way.
 Most
 obviously
 is
 the


case
 like
 this
 piece
 I
 wrote
 for
 the
 LRB


about
 Emil
 Zolah's
 Rugo
 Macar
 which
 is


his
 20
 novel
 cycle
 and
 so
 I
 had
 to
 read


20
 Zolola
 novels
 casual
 and
 when
 you


read
 that
 much
 of
 an
 author
 he
 does


leech
 into
 the
 groundwater
 and
 so


reading
 this
 book
 back
 there's
 so
 much


Zolola
 his
 fingerprints
 are
 all
 over
 it


and
 so
 that's
 like
 a
 really
 obvious
 case


teaching
 also
 influences
 my
 thinking
 the


teaching
 sometimes
 leads
 to
 criticism
 I


will
 notice
 a
 thing
 in
 my
 students
 work


and
 I'll
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 why
 is
 it


like
 that
 and
 that
 will
 lead
 to


criticism
 And
 sometimes
 the
 criticism


leads
 to
 quirks
 in
 my
 own
 writing.
 And


so
 it
 is
 a
 wild
 ecosystem.
 One
 thing


that
 I
 noticed
 and
 really
 appreciated
 is


I
 think
 it
 was
 for
 book
 form
 you


reviewed
 intermetso
 and
 in
 the
 middle
 of


that
 review
 you
 mentioned
 that
 in
 books


by
 European
 authors
 they
 have
 friends


the
 main
 characters
 and
 there's
 a
 social


world
 and
 in
 books
 by
 American
 authors


they
 do
 not.
 And
 while
 reading
 this


minor
 black
 figures,
 I
 noticed
 the
 rich


social
 world.
 And
 you
 mentioned
 it
 in


this
 interview.
 And
 so
 that
 for
 me,
 as
 I


was
 reading,
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 that


symbiotic
 relationship.


As
 I
 was
 writing
 it,
 I
 was
 also
 thinking


about
 that
 as
 I
 was
 I've
 now


indoctrinated
 my
 students
 into
 this


where
 I
 call
 it
 loser
 fiction
 where
 it's


just
 you
 guys
 notice
 that
 all
 your


characters
 are
 losers.
 They
 don't
 have


friends.
 They
 don't
 have
 families.
 They


don't
 know
 their
 neighbors.
 They
 don't


even
 live
 in
 a
 neighborhood.
 They
 just


live
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 totally
 secluded


threedimensional
 space.
 And
 it
 now


they've
 started
 giving
 their
 characters


friends
 again.
 So
 friends
 are
 coming


back.
 Friends
 are
 back.
 2025.


I
 know.
 I
 mean,
 but
 it's
 wild.
 It
 was


wild
 to
 see
 because
 I'd
 read
 Intermetza


and
 I'd
 read
 all
 these
 other
 books
 by


Irish
 and
 European
 authors
 and
 oh,
 this


person's
 afraid
 of
 their
 neighbor


finding
 out
 this
 thing
 about
 them.
 When


was
 the
 last
 time
 I
 read
 an
 American


novel
 with
 a
 neighbor
 in
 it?


Isolated,
 anxious,
 losers.
 Loser


fiction.
 Loser
 fiction
 is
 a
 phrase
 that


will
 stick
 with
 me
 for
 a
 long
 time.


I
 guess
 going
 off
 of
 that,
 what
 else
 are


you,
 now
 I'm
 just
 like
 picking
 your


brain,
 but
 what
 else
 are
 you
 noticing
 in


books
 these
 days?
 What
 excites
 you?
 What


are
 you
 seeing?
 I'm
 working
 on
 a
 perhaps


too
 long
 article
 about
 Rachel
 Kusk
 and


her
 sort
 of
 literary
 descendants
 and


what
 autofiction
 was
 basically.
 And
 it


does
 seem
 that
 we're
 at
 the
 end
 of
 that


mode
 and
 that
 we're
 entering
 this


rejuvenation
 of
 this
 multi-deade


spanning
 family
 saga.
 So
 that's


interesting
 to
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 sort
 of


after
 a
 period
 of
 experimentation
 going


mainstream
 in
 American
 literature,
 we're


sort
 of
 reverting
 to
 a
 more
 conservative


form
 and
 what
 can
 be
 more
 conservative


than
 the
 multi-deade,


which
 is
 a
 novel
 form
 I
 really
 love.
 And


so
 that's
 the
 thing
 I've
 noticed
 most.


Also,
 there
 was
 a
 raft
 of
 novels
 that
 I


called
 wrong
 protagonist
 novels
 where


they
 uh


What
 are
 those?


It's
 a
 novel
 in
 which
 a
 character
 who's


not
 very
 interesting
 goes
 in
 search
 of


like
 a
 more
 interesting
 character
 who


has
 gone
 missing,
 died.
 They're
 trying


to
 figure
 out
 what
 happened
 to
 this


person
 who
 is
 infinitely
 more


interesting
 than
 them.
 And
 so
 it's
 a
 lot


of
 novels
 about
 podcasters,
 novels
 about


detectives,
 novels
 about
 a
 woman
 in


search
 of
 her
 missing
 insert
 mother,


sister,
 friend,
 whatever.
 And
 I
 find


that
 genre
 of
 novel
 really
 interesting.


It's
 almost
 true
 crimey,
 but
 the
 book


should
 just
 be
 about
 that
 more


interesting
 person,
 but
 it's
 not.


Say
 the
 title
 of
 the
 genre
 again.
 More


wrong
 protagonist
 novels.


So
 we
 have
 wrong
 protagonist
 novels.
 We


have
 loser
 fiction.
 Talk
 to
 me
 about


your
 taxonomy.


Those
 are
 like
 the
 two
 most
 obvious


kinds
 that
 you
 just
 see
 a
 ton.
 Weirdly


enough,
 I
 feel
 like
 campus
 novels
 are


coming
 back.
 Where
 were
 you
 guys
 when
 I


was
 writing
 real
 life?
 I
 needed
 to
 feel


like
 I
 was
 in
 the
 midst.
 I
 think
 like


neo
 gothic
 is
 coming
 back
 as
 well.
 The


sort
 of
 suburban
 gothic
 where
 it's
 often


like
 a
 woman
 in
 a
 house
 and
 there's


something
 odd
 about
 it.


The
 I'm
 laughing
 because
 when
 put
 this


way,
 these
 sound
 so
 silly,
 but
 I
 love


all
 of
 these
 types
 of
 novels.


Oh,
 sign
 me
 up.
 A
 novel
 about
 a


misanthropic
 guy
 living
 in
 an
 apartment


building.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 any
 of
 his


neighbors.
 I'll
 read
 400
 pages.
 I
 cannot


wait
 for
 the
 sequel.


Well,
 given
 all
 of
 the
 various
 types
 of


novels,
 can
 we
 know?
 Are
 you
 working
 on


anything
 next?
 And
 is
 it
 a
 radically


different
 type?
 Is
 it
 one
 of
 these
 types


of
 novels?


You
 know
 what?
 I
 I
 signed
 my
 first
 book


contract
 in
 2018.
 It
 was
 a
 two-book


deal.
 And
 then
 in
 2020,
 I
 signed
 another


two
 book
 deal,
 which
 means
 that
 for
 the


last
 seven
 or
 eight
 years,
 I've
 always


known
 what
 the
 next
 book
 would
 be
 or
 I


knew
 that
 my
 next
 book
 would
 have
 a


home.
 But
 now
 I
 I
 I
 don't.
 And
 so
 I'm


finding
 out
 what
 it
 is
 like
 again
 to


write
 fiction
 in
 absence
 of
 a
 structure


or
 like
 a
 contract
 or
 whatever.
 And
 so


I'm
 getting
 to
 know
 myself
 again
 in
 a


way.
 But
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 feel
 like
 I


fought
 against
 writing
 a
 tennis
 novel


for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 over
 the
 summer
 I


feel
 like
 I
 finally
 just
 got
 worn
 down


and
 I'm
 like
 you
 know
 I'm
 gonna
 give
 in.


I'm
 going
 to
 like
 give
 in
 to
 the
 muse


and
 so
 I'm
 tinkering
 with
 the
 beginnings


of
 a
 tennis
 novel.


That's
 so
 exciting.
 Both
 knowing
 how


much
 tennis
 you
 play.
 You
 write
 about


tennis
 quite
 a
 lot.


In
 my
 brain
 challengers
 is
 there's
 so


much
 tension
 and
 possibility
 in
 tennis


as
 a
 sport.
 Yeah,
 it's
 inherently


narrative
 and
 it's
 right
 now
 I'm
 sort
 of


shuttling
 between
 two
 ideas
 which
 I


won't
 give
 away,
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 curious


which
 one
 will
 win
 out.
 My
 next
 novel


might
 be
 a
 tennis
 novel
 or
 like
 a


Southern
 Gothic,
 which
 is
 another
 book


I've
 been
 working
 on
 for
 seven
 years
 and


just
 keep
 putting
 away.


And
 those
 are
 so
 different,
 those
 types.


Southern
 Gothic,
 tennis.


Yeah,
 I
 know.
 It's
 the
 the
 mind
 never


rests.


Well,
 before
 we
 go,
 I
 just
 have
 a
 few


last
 questions
 really
 quickly.
 If
 minor


black
 figures
 could
 whisper
 something


from
 the
 shelf
 to
 a
 reader
 who's
 passing


by,
 what
 would
 it
 say
 to
 them?


Oh,
 that's
 such
 a
 good
 question
 because


there's
 a
 theodore
 Diser
 in
 my
 heart,


the
 sort
 of
 social
 novelist
 in
 my
 heart


wants,
 you
 know,
 to
 whisper,
 "What
 is
 it


like
 to
 preserve
 your
 own
 sort
 of
 weird


subjectivity
 in
 this
 world
 that's
 trying


so
 hard
 to
 homogenize
 us?"
 But
 then
 the


sort
 of
 swoon
 me
 Ryan
 in
 me
 wants
 people


to
 pick
 it
 up
 and
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


a
 book
 that
 swoons
 where
 love
 is


possible."
 And
 I
 did
 write
 a
 swooning


scene
 in
 the
 book
 that
 that
 I
 when
 I


read
 it,
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 finally
 wrote
 a


character
 being
 swept
 off
 their
 feet.


Those
 are
 my
 two
 those
 are
 my
 two
 little


whisperers
 that
 love
 is
 possible
 and
 you


can
 preserve
 your
 own
 subjectivity.
 And


then
 my
 last
 question
 is,
 are
 you


reading
 anything
 good
 these
 days?
 Do
 you


have
 anything
 that
 you
 want
 to


recommend?
 Well,
 I'm
 reading
 Madame


Bovery,
 which
 hot
 take
 so
 good.
 So,
 I'm


reading
 Madam
 Bovery
 because
 I'm


teaching
 a
 class
 on
 ideology
 and


fiction,
 but
 for
 contemporary
 novels,


there's
 this
 wonderful,
 strange
 book


called
 Muscleman
 by
 Jordan
 Castro.


I
 don't
 know
 this.


It
 just
 came
 out,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 the


gayest
 book
 of
 2025.
 It's
 about
 a


professor
 who
 gets
 stuck
 in
 a
 long


faculty
 meeting,
 and
 all
 he
 wants
 to
 be


doing
 is
 lifting
 at
 the
 gym.
 And


it's
 so
 smart
 on
 all
 of
 our
 sort
 of


contemporary
 anxieties
 around


masculinity,
 but
 also
 like
 what
 it
 means


to
 be
 in
 the
 humanities,
 which
 is
 a


rapidly
 fraught
 space.
 And
 it's
 so


funny.
 It's
 so
 smart.
 It's
 so
 light
 on


its
 feet.
 And
 it's
 like
 Thomas


Burnernhard
 meets
 a
 gym
 meme
 Instagram


account.
 It's
 exquisite.
 I
 love
 it
 so


much.
 This
 sounds
 so
 good.
 Readers,
 go


check
 that
 out.
 And
 also
 go
 check
 out


Minor
 Black
 Figures
 by
 Brandon
 Taylor.


Brandon,
 this
 has
 been
 incredible.
 Thank


you
 for
 joining
 us.
 A
 thanks
 for
 having


me.
 Can't
 wait
 to
 come
 back.


That
 was
 my
 conversation
 with
 Brandon


Taylor
 about
 his
 new
 book,
 Minor
 Black


Figures.
 I'm
 MJ
 Franklin,
 an
 editor
 here


at
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review.
 Thank


you
 for
 listening.
 We'll
 see
 you
 next


week.
