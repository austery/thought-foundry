[Music]


hi
 everybody
 I'm
 Nikolai
 tangan
 and
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 sov
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 in
 properly
 good
 company
 with


Jennifer
 scanland
 president
 and
 CEO
 of


the
 remarkable
 UL
 Solutions
 now
 UL


Solutions
 specialize
 in
 safety
 testing


across
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 areas
 from


household
 appliances
 Industrial


Equipment
 building
 materials
 medical


devices
 lots
 of
 interesting
 things
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 and
 we
 own
 1.6%
 of


the
 company
 equivalent
 to
 $160
 million


Jennifer
 huge
 pleasure
 to
 have
 you
 on


today
 it's
 such
 a
 pleasure
 to
 be
 here


Nikolai
 we're
 thrilled
 to
 be
 part
 of


your
 portfolio
 as
 a
 newly
 public
 company


absolutely
 so
 let's
 just
 uh
 kick
 off


with
 the
 basics
 what
 exactly
 do
 you
 guys


test
 so
 we
 test
 products
 and
 we
 test


products
 in
 the
 industrial
 space
 um


where
 our
 customers
 are
 in
 the
 B2B


environment
 and
 we
 test
 products
 in
 the


consumer
 space
 where
 our
 customers
 are


really
 in
 the
 B
 Toc
 environment
 and
 then


we
 have
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 offerings
 of


software
 and
 advisory
 services
 that
 help


those
 customers
 uh
 have
 uh
 better
 usage


of
 the
 data
 and
 some
 of
 the
 advisory


services
 that
 they
 need
 to
 get
 their


products
 to


market
 now
 how
 do
 how
 do
 you
 test
 what


kind
 of
 things
 do
 you
 do
 with
 the


products
 visiting
 our
 Labs
 is
 always


such
 a
 crowd-pleaser
 uh
 we
 do
 things


like
 we
 drop
 things
 from
 six
 feet
 high


see
 if
 they
 break
 we
 break
 things
 we
 may


try
 to
 put
 an
 anvil
 on
 top
 of
 let's
 say


a
 uh
 helmet
 for
 personal
 protective
 gear


we
 try
 to
 blow
 things
 up
 our
 fire
 Labs


uh
 here
 in
 North
 brick
 at
 our


headquarters
 uh
 were
 constantly
 lighting


things
 on
 fire
 and
 then
 all
 over
 the


world
 we're
 trying
 to
 uh
 ensure
 that
 uh


the
 way
 that
 products
 are
 used
 over
 and


over
 again
 meets
 a
 set
 of
 Standards
 uh


we
 may
 stick
 a
 boot
 in
 a
 pool
 of
 water


for
 48
 hours
 with
 sensors
 inside
 to
 see


if
 there's
 any
 leakage
 anything
 you


could
 possibly
 think
 of
 to
 test
 a


product
 we
 probably
 do
 H
 and
 why
 is
 the


testing
 Market
 growing
 the
 testing


Market's
 growing
 for
 a
 number
 of
 reasons


and
 it's
 really
 driven
 by
 I
 would
 say


the
 amount
 of
 transparency
 that


consumers
 now
 have
 we
 all
 want
 to
 keep


ourselves
 safe
 our
 family
 safe
 our


children
 in
 particular
 safe
 and
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 information
 that's
 available
 so


you
 think
 about
 50
 years
 ago
 nobody
 was


paying
 attention
 to
 things
 like
 uh


volatile
 organic
 compounds
 voc's
 and
 how


much
 of
 you
 know
 that
 new
 car
 smell
 or


new
 carpet
 smell
 um
 what
 that
 was


actually
 doing
 uh
 to
 you
 know
 our
 lungs


or
 our
 bodies
 and
 so
 as
 consumers
 have


more
 information
 about
 products
 they


want
 better
 assurance
 that
 those


products
 are
 safe
 secure
 sustainable
 you


know
 additionally
 as
 the
 Confluence
 of


Technology
 comes
 together
 you
 have


second
 order
 effects
 of
 safety
 so
 a


component
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 might
 be
 safe


but
 when
 you
 weave
 it
 together
 into
 a


larger
 system
 and
 then
 add
 software
 to


that
 system
 uh
 lots
 of
 things
 can
 go


wrong
 so
 it's
 you
 know
 this
 exponential


explosion
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 have
 to


think
 about
 when
 you're
 testing
 product


safety
 so
 uh
 give
 some
 more
 examples
 of


the
 stuff
 that
 we're
 testing
 today
 which


we
 didn't
 test
 let's
 say
 10
 20
 years
 ago


you
 know
 to
 start
 with
 um
 I
 mean
 let's


just
 start
 with
 uh
 the
 Confluence
 of
 now


ai
 and
 the
 way
 that
 that's
 being


embedded
 in
 products
 I
 was
 at
 one
 of
 our


largest
 uh
 retail
 customers
 a
 year
 ago


and
 launching
 our
 retail
 center
 of


excellence
 in
 Arkansas
 and
 they
 said
 to


us
 hey
 there's
 AI
 embedded
 in
 this
 kids


toy
 how
 do
 we
 think
 about
 this
 and
 you


know
 on
 one
 hand
 you
 know
 an
 individual


toy
 with
 a
 you
 know
 couple
 pieces
 of


algorithm
 in
 there
 may
 or
 may
 not


present
 a
 safety
 hazard
 but
 when
 you


start
 thinking
 about
 the
 ways
 in
 which


AI
 can
 power
 industri
 Trail
 controls
 or


change
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 decisions
 are


made
 about
 um
 the
 use
 of
 software
 in
 a


complex
 vehicle
 now
 you
 have
 to
 start


thinking
 about
 how
 do
 we
 validate
 that


those
 algorithms
 we
 using
 uh
 the
 right


data
 how
 do
 we
 consider
 uh
 the


functional
 safety
 the
 second
 order


effects
 of
 the
 way
 that
 those
 products


are
 connected
 and
 how
 do
 we
 just
 think


differently
 about
 this
 entire
 higher
 uh


you
 know
 kind
 of
 integration
 and
 and


Confluence
 of
 Technologies
 so
 that's
 you


know
 our
 most
 state-of-the-art
 extreme


but
 even
 on
 the
 Other
 Extreme
 you
 know


something
 as
 simple
 as
 wiring
 cable
 you


know
 we'll
 test
 the
 efficacy
 of
 wiring


cable
 and
 uh
 I
 had
 a
 customer
 call
 me
 uh


a
 little
 over
 a
 year
 ago
 and
 say
 Hey
 you


know
 the
 standards
 and
 the
 way
 that


we're
 testing
 uh
 that
 worked
 back
 in
 the


1950s
 and
 60s
 When
 contractors


installing
 that
 cable
 used
 these
 types


of
 tools
 well
 fast
 forward
 technology


has
 changed
 in
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 um


buildings
 are
 built
 the
 ways
 in
 which


contractors
 work
 and
 so
 you
 should


change
 your
 test
 methods
 you
 should


think
 about
 changing
 the
 standards
 and


advocating
 on
 our
 behalf
 for
 that
 uh
 and


we
 did
 that
 and
 that
 recently
 just
 got


published
 as
 an
 update
 so
 there's
 just
 a


constant
 Evolution
 because
 of
 technology


in
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 uh
 you
 need
 to
 test


things
 and
 and
 the
 types
 of
 testing
 we


do
 is
 there
 much
 difference
 between
 the


various
 geographical
 areas
 so
 do
 we
 test


more
 in
 Europe
 for
 instance
 than
 you
 do


in
 the
 US
 the
 US
 is
 certainly
 the
 most


highly
 regulated
 market
 uh
 in
 fact
 the


US
 in
 many
 cases
 requires
 third-party


testing
 not
 every
 Market
 requires


thirdparty
 testing
 of
 of
 distinct


products
 but
 the
 US
 uh
 has
 a
 much


greater
 amount
 of
 third-party
 testing


requirements
 and
 that's
 from
 regulations


but
 it's
 also
 from
 the
 way
 our
 insurance


industry
 works
 and
 it's
 also
 quite


frankly


uh
 our
 Tor
 system
 here
 and
 so
 that
 third


party
 testing
 can
 really
 protect


manufacturers
 in
 addition
 to
 protecting


consumers
 so
 that's
 um
 you
 know
 that's


kind
 of
 how
 we
 think
 about
 it
 all
 over


the
 world
 as
 a
 manufacturer
 you're


trying
 to
 get
 products
 into
 multiple


markets
 so
 you're
 looking
 for
 what's
 the


common
 denominator
 of
 tests
 uh
 that
 can


get
 your
 product
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and


then
 what's
 distinct
 uh
 for
 each
 market


and
 and
 we
 help
 our
 customers
 maneuver


through
 uh
 all
 of
 those


regulations
 so
 if
 I
 test
 for
 something


in
 America
 I
 can
 sell
 it
 in
 Europe
 let's


say
 I
 have
 a
 toy
 if
 you
 test
 for
 It
 in


America
 it's
 highly
 likely
 it
 will
 pass


all
 of
 uh
 the
 European
 standards
 but
 not


necessarily
 and
 and
 I'll
 give
 some
 great


examples
 even
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 Minnesota
 a


couple
 years
 ago
 uh
 changed
 some


regulations
 around
 use
 of
 I
 want
 to
 say


cadmium
 and
 lithium
 in
 products
 and
 so


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 know
 if
 you
 wanted


to
 sell
 your
 product
 in
 Minnesota
 you


had
 to
 meet
 these
 extra
 tests
 well
 no


manufacturer
 is
 only
 selling
 into


Minnesota
 they're
 selling
 across
 the


United
 States
 and
 then
 thinking
 about


Europe
 and
 so
 they
 start
 testing
 maybe
 a


broader
 array
 than
 they
 otherwise
 would


have
 needed
 so
 again
 we
 help
 our


customers
 think
 about
 what's
 the
 full


set
 of
 markets
 you
 want
 to
 get
 your


product
 into
 what's
 that
 set
 of
 tests


that
 meets
 those
 criteria
 how
 do
 we
 do


that
 most
 expeditiously
 so
 that
 when


that
 product
 lands
 in
 customs
 and
 the


Customs
 agent
 is
 looking
 for
 the


certification
 uh
 they
 know
 that
 it's


it's
 passed
 that
 test
 for
 that
 market


what's
 the
 weirdest
 thing
 you
 test


what's
 the
 weirdest
 thing
 we
 test
 I'll


tell
 you
 the
 most
 one
 of
 the
 most
 fun


things
 we've
 tested
 uh
 two
 years
 ago
 we


stacked
 up
 two
 million
 soda
 pop
 cans
 in


our
 largescale
 testing
 lab
 and
 you
 know


our
 team
 probably
 worked
 uh
 you
 know
 a


good
 portion
 of
 a
 week
 just
 to
 get
 those


stacked
 and
 then
 what
 happens
 is


somebody
 walks
 through
 the
 middle
 and


drops
 a
 lighted
 piece
 of
 paper
 and
 walks


away
 and
 we've
 got
 all
 these
 sensors
 and


we're
 behind
 glass
 and
 they
 waited
 to


see
 what
 would
 happen
 and
 in
 that


particular
 test
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 know


whether
 they
 were
 testing
 labels
 or


aluminum
 or
 the
 warehouse
 itself
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 even
 know
 exactly
 who
 they
 were


testing
 on
 behalf
 of
 but
 what
 they


thought
 was
 going
 to
 happen
 was
 that


those
 aluminum
 cans
 would
 collapse
 upon


themselves
 from
 the
 heat
 instead
 they


exploded
 outwards
 failed
 test
 but
 a
 lot


of
 information
 uh
 for
 that
 customer
 in


determining
 how
 they
 needed
 to
 either


you
 know
 again
 manufactur
 that
 container


or
 uh
 build
 out
 that
 warehouse
 to
 hold


those
 types
 of
 products
 now
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 we
 think
 uh
 testing
 is
 a
 good


industry
 is
 because
 it's
 a
 relatively


cheap
 thing
 to
 do
 and
 it
 has
 huge


implications
 for
 the
 product
 right
 um
 so


these
 kind
 of
 things
 what
 do
 they
 cost


what
 do
 what
 does
 it
 cost
 to
 test


something
 it
 can
 range
 you
 know
 if


you're
 if
 if
 I'm
 rubbing
 you
 know
 my


sweater
 10,000
 times
 uh
 that
 has
 to
 be


in
 and
 out
 in
 the
 lab
 in
 about
 3
 days


and
 it's
 a
 pretty
 lowcost
 test
 if
 you're


testing
 let's
 say
 a
 product
 that's
 going


to
 26
 markets
 around
 the
 world
 and
 it


has
 a
 big
 uh
 life
 or
 health
 safety
 risk


you
 know
 that
 can
 cross
 into
 um
 you
 know


a
 much
 greater
 part
 of
 new
 product


development
 you
 know
 into
 the
 hundreds


of
 thousands
 of
 dollars


range
 H
 if
 you
 sell
 something
 uh
 that


you
 have
 imported
 from
 some
 emerging


market
 do
 you
 have
 to
 test
 it
 in
 the
 US


do
 you
 have
 to
 have
 local
 testing
 no
 you


have
 to
 have
 passed
 the
 US
 tests
 and


this
 is
 why
 we
 have
 Labs
 all
 over
 the


world
 so
 we
 try
 to
 be
 close
 to
 our


Customer
 because
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 cases
 if
 a


test
 fails
 they're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 go


back
 to
 their
 research
 and
 development


organization
 their
 new
 product


development
 team
 and
 make
 the
 right


adjustments
 so
 we
 have
 Labs
 all
 over
 the


world
 to
 be
 close
 to
 our
 customer
 and


those
 labs
 know
 how
 to
 test
 to
 the
 US


standards
 to
 the
 EU
 standards
 to
 local


market
 standards
 in
 in
 every
 country


around
 the
 world
 how
 many
 people
 you


have
 15,000
 in
 wow
 yes
 and
 and
 that


launches
 us
 into
 110
 markets
 around
 the


world
 any
 new
 uh
 regulatory
 requirements


that
 you
 are
 particularly
 excited
 about


I
 think
 the
 one
 that
 we're
 most
 excited


about
 right
 now
 is
 we
 were
 named
 the


lead
 administrator
 on
 the
 US
 cyber
 trust


Mark
 and
 you
 know
 I
 viewed
 this
 it's


probably
 version
 one
 of
 the
 type
 of


product
 uh
 cyber
 safety
 that
 consumers


are
 looking
 for
 uh
 today
 as
 a
 consumer


you
 really
 don't
 have
 good
 evidence
 that


that
 product
 has
 been
 tested
 so
 you
 know


you
 always
 hear
 the
 horror
 stories
 of


like
 the
 baby
 monitors
 and
 being
 hacked


into
 uh
 but
 more
 broadly
 giving


consumers
 a
 view
 a
 lens
 into
 the
 fact


that
 the
 products
 that
 that
 they're


purchasing
 have
 passed
 a
 certain
 set
 of


you
 know
 validation
 and
 standards
 um
 to


make
 them
 safe
 so
 so
 we're
 excited
 about


that
 that's
 something
 new
 uh
 that
 the


FCC
 has
 chosen
 us
 as
 a
 lead


administrator
 I
 think
 the
 other
 testing


when
 you
 move
 to
 the
 Other


Extreme
 um
 lithium
 ion
 batteries
 the


electrification
 of
 everything
 is
 such
 an


important
 topic
 and
 we
 saw
 in
 New
 York


City
 alone
 uh
 you
 know
 over
 a
 dozen


deaths
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 from
 lithium


ion
 batteries
 and
 ebikes
 uh


spontaneously


combusting
 and
 that
 can
 be
 prevented
 and


it
 can
 be
 prevented
 by
 following
 some
 UL


standards
 around
 the
 uh
 battery


enclosure
 around
 the
 connector
 and
 uh
 we


worked
 with
 the
 city
 of
 New
 York
 to
 turn


those
 standards
 into
 law
 and
 as
 we've


seen
 uh
 some
 recent
 data
 it's
 evident


that
 the
 number
 of
 deaths
 uh
 have


reduced
 pretty
 significantly
 as
 a
 result


of
 those
 standards
 being
 put
 into
 law
 so


those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 are


the
 most
 fulfilling
 for
 our
 15,000


employees
 is
 really
 seeing
 the
 evidence


uh
 that
 we
 are
 working
 for
 a
 safer
 world


the
 fact
 that
 global
 trade
 seems
 to
 be


going
 a
 bit
 in
 the
 wrong
 direction
 now


what
 are
 the
 implications
 for
 you
 yeah


for
 us
 it's
 really
 the
 implications
 for


our
 customers
 and
 I
 like
 to
 say
 our


customers
 are
 really
 smart
 and
 they've


been
 worrying
 about
 this
 for
 you
 know


almost
 a
 decade
 when
 the
 first
 set
 of
 of


tariffs
 started
 shifting
 under
 the
 first


Trump
 Administration
 customers
 started


making
 different
 decisions
 they
 make


different
 decisions
 about
 their
 raw


materials
 they
 make
 different
 decisions


about
 their
 suppliers
 and
 their
 supply


chain
 they
 may
 value
 engineer
 their


products
 and
 swap
 out
 components
 uh
 they


may
 move
 the
 location
 of
 their
 Factory


in
 many
 of
 those
 cases
 it
 does
 require


that
 product
 to
 be
 retested
 uh
 to
 a
 new


standard
 based
 on
 on
 those
 new
 um


designs
 or
 those
 new
 manufacturing


parameters
 so
 we
 just
 stay
 by
 our


customer
 side
 to
 help
 them
 maneuver


through
 the
 decisions
 that
 they're


making
 in
 response
 to
 the
 shifting


tariff
 climate
 who
 do
 you
 compete
 with


our
 competitors
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


fascinating
 industry
 just
 in
 product


testing
 uh
 we
 estimate
 that
 um
 there
 are


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 companies
 you
 can


be
 you
 know
 a
 a
 getting
 a
 PhD
 at
 a


university
 and
 come
 up
 with
 a
 uh
 testing


protocol
 for
 the
 specific
 you
 know


product
 or
 uh
 use
 of
 of
 what
 you're


studying
 and
 you
 could
 be
 a
 competitor


to
 us
 or
 you
 could
 be
 a
 large
 European


publicly
 traded
 uh
 company
 uh
 that
 has


you
 know
 similar
 longevity
 to
 what
 we


have
 we've
 been
 in
 business
 100
 30
 years


and
 uh
 some
 of
 our
 competitors
 have
 as


well
 this
 is
 a
 longstanding
 industry
 you


know
 again
 connected
 to
 you
 know


insurance
 and
 shipping
 originally
 but


moving
 into
 as
 the
 industrial


environment
 evolved
 and
 then
 consumer


awareness
 evolved
 and
 global
 trade


evolved
 um
 has
 really
 opened
 it
 up
 so


we've
 got
 competitors
 all
 over
 the
 world


and
 why
 do
 that
 Choose
 You
 is
 this


reputation
 or
 Price
 or
 uh
 how
 does
 he


work
 I
 think
 our
 customers
 first
 and


foremost
 they
 want
 to
 know
 that
 they
 can


get
 their
 product
 to
 Market
 quickly
 and


safely
 and
 UL
 has
 the
 longest
 reputation


and
 I
 believe
 the
 most
 recognizable


brand
 uh
 in
 the
 North
 American
 markets


so
 the
 first
 and
 foremost
 question
 we


get
 from
 customers
 is
 really
 you
 know


they
 call
 do
 you
 have
 the
 technical


expertise
 for
 this
 you
 know
 new
 product


or
 all
 new
 and
 improve
 the
 next


generation
 of
 product
 the
 next
 question


they
 ask
 is
 can
 you
 get
 it
 done
 quickly


and
 then
 they
 want
 to
 know
 how
 much
 does


it
 cost
 us
 um
 but
 getting
 that
 product


to
 Market
 you
 know
 I
 spent
 almost
 20


years
 in
 manufacturing
 when
 you're


investing
 in
 new
 product
 development
 and


you
 want
 to
 get
 a
 product
 to
 Market
 and


there's
 a
 delay
 because
 of
 testing
 uh


that's
 really
 frustrating
 that's
 when


the
 CEO
 picks
 up
 the
 phone
 and
 and
 is


you
 know
 really
 pushing
 that
 new
 product


development
 team
 on
 you
 know
 where
 the


heck
 is
 it
 why
 why
 aren't
 those
 trucks


shipping
 so
 we
 need
 to
 be
 right
 there
 by


our
 sides
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 you
 know


we're
 the
 facilitator
 not
 the
 bottleneck


in
 our
 customers
 processes
 you
 mentioned


you've
 been
 in
 business
 for
 130
 years


now
 you
 came
 in
 I
 believe
 in
 2019
 what


uh
 what
 have
 you
 done
 with
 the
 company


since
 you
 took
 over
 when
 I
 joined
 in


2019
 UL
 was
 for
 profit
 but
 we
 were


privately
 held
 by
 a
 single
 shareholder


who
 was
 not
 for
 profit
 so
 it
 was
 a


little
 unusual


structure
 and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I


joined
 you
 so
 was
 it
 like
 a
 sleepy
 was


it
 like
 a
 sleepy
 company
 it
 was
 a


company
 that
 actually
 prided
 ourselves


in
 being
 under
 the
 radar
 so
 there
 was


this
 opportunity
 to
 introduce
 the
 UL


story
 uh
 to
 a
 you
 know
 a
 broader


population
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 did
 was


we
 rebranded
 so
 we
 were
 UL
 Inc
 when
 I


joined
 and
 in
 the
 process
 of
 thinking


about
 uh
 becoming
 public
 and
 in
 uh


continuing
 that
 consistency
 and


continuity
 of
 brand
 uh
 with
 our
 not
 for


profit
 Affiliates
 uh
 we
 rebranded
 as
 UL


Solutions
 and
 uh
 created
 the
 fond
 Mobius


logo
 and
 launched
 that
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 2022
 so
 that
 was


exciting
 but
 where
 I
 had
 to
 start
 was


really
 taking
 a
 company
 that
 had
 been


for
 profit
 for
 about
 seven
 years
 and


having
 them
 start
 to
 think
 about
 what


would
 be
 the
 same
 and
 what
 would
 be


different
 if
 we
 had
 more
 than
 one


shareholder
 because
 I
 knew
 that
 that
 was


the
 likely
 outcome
 and
 that
 our
 singular


shareholder
 was
 looking
 to
 monetize
 uh


part
 of
 their
 position
 so
 that
 they


could
 build
 an
 endowment
 and
 and
 focus


on
 their
 primary
 Safety
 Science
 research


in
 the
 areas
 that
 that
 they're
 really


focused
 so
 bringing
 our
 employees
 along


without
 you
 know
 a
 strategic
 decision


having
 been
 made
 about
 which
 direction


the
 parent
 company
 was
 going
 to
 go
 in
 uh


was
 an
 interesting
 exercise
 you
 know
 we


had
 to
 start
 talking
 about
 shareholders


or
 the
 sharehold
 older
 and
 start


thinking
 about
 you
 know
 how
 do
 we
 aim


for
 best-in-class
 return
 start
 thinking


about
 how
 do
 we
 tell
 this
 story
 in
 a
 way


that
 is
 understandable
 and
 exciting
 to


investors
 and
 that
 was
 fun
 for
 me
 as
 a


new
 CEO
 to
 join
 and
 to
 have
 that


opportunity
 what
 do
 you
 think
 uh
 being
 a


a
 listed
 company
 has
 done
 to
 the
 culture


has
 it
 changed
 much
 it's
 absolutely


changed
 and
 I
 think
 even
 the
 process
 of


getting
 to
 that
 changed
 us
 but
 one
 of


the
 Great
 greatest
 things
 that
 being


listed
 has
 done
 for
 us
 is
 it
 really
 has


taken
 us
 above
 the
 radar
 and
 it's
 helped


us
 attract
 talent
 I
 think
 it's
 helped


extend
 our
 brand
 and
 our
 value
 with
 our


customers
 and
 certainly
 it
 positions
 us


uh
 with
 the
 capital
 markets
 for
 growth


in
 the
 future
 in
 an
 industry
 that's


that's
 large
 and
 fragmented
 and
 growing


now
 I
 believe
 you
 are
 also
 a
 big
 uh
 user


of
 data
 analytics
 and
 just
 how
 um
 How
 is


uh
 more
 data
 and
 data
 analytics
 changing


the
 way
 you
 uh
 you
 test
 and
 go
 about


your
 business
 there's
 a
 couple
 different


ways
 we
 think
 about
 data
 and
 analytics


almost
 10%
 of
 our
 revenue
 is
 from


software
 software
 is
 a
 service
 that
 we


sell
 to
 our
 customers
 and
 a
 great


example
 of
 that
 is
 uh
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


pieces
 of
 software
 is
 focused
 on
 having


injested
 all
 of
 the
 chemical
 information


from
 material
 safety
 data
 sheets
 into
 a


system
 using
 that
 data
 to
 help
 retailers


understand
 how
 they
 live
 up
 to


regulations
 around
 the
 transport
 the


sale
 or
 the
 disposal
 of
 products


containing
 chemicals
 in
 their


environment
 but
 what
 our
 retailers
 have


discovered
 and
 where
 we
 help
 them
 is


there's
 lots
 of
 derivative
 uses
 of
 that


data
 for
 their


environment
 we're
 constantly
 thinking


about
 how
 do
 we
 help
 those
 large


retailers
 uh
 better
 use
 that
 data
 and


that's
 just
 one
 slice
 of
 the
 data
 we


have
 we
 have
 880,000
 customers
 we've
 got


information
 on
 billions
 of


products
 helping
 our
 customers
 better


use
 that
 data
 to
 stay
 ahead
 of


regulatory
 requirements
 or
 uh
 think


about
 other
 derivative
 uses
 both
 in
 you


know
 sustainability
 reporting
 or
 scope


two
 scope
 three
 how
 it
 traces
 back


through
 their
 component
 manufacturers
 or


their
 raw
 material
 suppliers
 is
 an
 in


Opportunity
 the
 other
 way
 we're
 thinking


about
 data
 and
 analytics
 is
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 future
 uh
 We've
 some


customers
 uh
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 with
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 you
 know


leading
 technologists
 in
 the
 world
 and


their
 focus
 on
 the
 industrial
 metaverse


and
 you
 start
 looking
 at
 the


opportunities
 for
 the
 way
 in
 which


digital
 twin
 and
 simulation
 and
 other


uses
 of
 data
 can
 help
 them
 work
 through


that
 new
 product
 development
 process


faster
 with
 better
 results
 is
 an
 area


we're
 really
 focused
 on
 so
 when
 you
 look


at
 AI
 you
 mentioned
 that
 you
 are
 um


testing
 for
 the
 use
 of
 AI
 in
 some


products
 um
 could
 you
 elaborate
 a
 bit
 on


that
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 well


with
 regard
 to
 AI
 we
 launched
 a
 verified


Mark
 as
 we
 call
 it
 uh
 last
 fall
 focused


on
 uh
 AI
 PCS
 and
 AI
 servers
 and
 and
 we


put
 together
 you
 know
 a
 list
 of
 let's


just
 call
 it
 10
 categories
 that
 we
 work


with
 our
 customers
 to
 walk
 through
 to
 to


achieve
 that
 Mark
 that
 can
 go
 onto
 a


product
 additionally
 uh
 those
 customers


as
 well
 as
 many
 others
 have
 come
 to
 us


and
 asked
 us
 to
 think
 about
 given
 that


there
 aren't
 any
 standards
 or
 real


regulations
 around
 this
 today
 what


should
 they
 be
 thinking
 about
 so
 we've


been
 convening
 uh
 different
 groups
 of


customers
 to
 work
 with
 our
 AI
 scientists


around
 how
 should
 we
 be
 better
 thinking


about
 what
 they
 should
 be
 building
 into


their
 products
 as
 well
 as
 how
 we
 can


help
 them
 advocate
 for
 regulation
 that's


sensible
 and
 meets
 the
 needs
 of
 a
 pretty


rapidly
 changing
 ever
 evolving


technology
 um
 it
 is
 something
 I
 I
 still


believe
 we're
 in
 you
 know
 we're
 in
 early


stages
 of
 AI
 um
 and
 we're
 barely
 even
 on


the
 road
 map
 on
 Quantum
 we
 can
 go
 there


too
 but
 all
 of
 these
 Technologies
 really


do
 change
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 humans
 are


going
 to
 interact
 with
 products
 but
 also


the
 way
 products
 are
 going
 to
 interact


with
 each
 other
 and
 that
 second
 order


effect
 of
 functional
 safety
 and
 the
 way


that
 AI
 is
 you
 know
 powering
 or


directing
 or
 uh
 concluding
 how
 that


product
 is
 going
 to
 work
 uh
 is
 is
 really


it's
 it's
 an
 exciting
 opportunity
 but


it's
 also
 daunting
 there's
 a
 lot
 that
 we


don't
 yet
 know
 how
 do
 you
 use
 it
 uh
 in


your
 company
 to
 to
 simplify
 and
 automate


there's
 a
 number
 of
 different
 ways
 uh


back
 to
 you
 know
 that
 software
 I
 was


talking
 about
 uh
 on
 the
 uh
 The
 View
 for


the
 retailers
 of
 chemicals
 that
 one
 of


our
 largest
 retailers
 came
 to
 us
 and
 has


asked
 us
 to
 help
 them
 um
 with
 uh
 you


know
 what
 I
 would
 call
 you
 know
 the


metadata
 about
 every
 product
 that
 they


could
 possibly
 sell
 through
 their


portals
 and
 then
 could
 possibly
 be


returned
 to
 them
 well
 pre
 AI
 that
 would


take
 a
 team
 of
 people
 you
 know
 an


extraordinary
 number
 of
 hours
 let's
 say


to
 put
 in
 500
 attributes
 about
 a
 product


uh
 with
 AI
 you
 can
 reduce
 the
 time
 to
 do


that
 uh


dramatically
 and
 so
 that's
 one
 you
 know


just
 particular
 use
 case
 of
 how
 we're


working
 with
 one
 customer
 we're
 also


really
 focused
 on
 the
 use
 of
 AI
 in


thinking
 about
 um
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 we


can
 help
 our
 customers
 uh
 reach
 faster


conclusions
 about
 uh
 whether
 or
 not


their
 product
 is
 safe
 so
 a
 really
 good


use
 case
 that
 we're
 focused
 on
 right
 now


is
 uh
 Plastics
 Plastics
 that
 are
 you


know
 on
 printed
 circuit
 boards
 or


surrounding
 you
 know
 consumer
 technology


that
 plastic
 has
 to
 sit
 in
 a
 long-term


thermal
 aging
 oven
 it
 could
 sit
 in
 there


for
 12
 months
 18
 months
 before
 it's


passed
 all
 those
 tests
 and
 so
 thinking


about
 how
 do
 we
 uh
 get
 data
 sooner
 about


how
 it's
 performing
 in
 this
 you
 know


kind
 of
 static
 environment
 uh
 to
 help


draw
 those
 conclusions
 faster
 so
 we're


applying
 AI
 across
 the
 board
 in
 all
 of


our
 areas
 do
 you
 think
 um
 it
 will


replace
 actual
 testing
 the
 fact
 that
 you


have
 a
 digital
 twin
 and
 can
 can
 show
 uh


the
 results
 I
 mean
 for
 instance
 now
 you


can
 crash


cars
 uh
 digitally
 right
 yeah
 I
 think


over
 time
 there's
 always
 opportunities


uh
 for
 you
 know
 the
 digital
 to
 replace


the
 physical
 um
 I
 also
 think
 that
 there


will
 continue
 to
 be
 these
 connection


points
 that
 will
 be
 difficult
 to


simulate
 in
 really


highrisk
 uh


situations
 um
 there
 I
 think
 for
 a
 while


there
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 the
 need
 to
 do


both
 um
 but
 it's
 something
 that
 we
 all


have
 to
 stay
 ahead
 of
 and
 make
 sure
 that


um
 what
 we're
 doing
 meets
 Regulators


needs
 as
 well
 as
 customers
 needs
 Jenny


moving
 on
 to
 um
 to
 leadership
 you
 have


been
 running
 both
 a
 manufacturing


company
 and
 now
 a
 global
 safety


organization
 how
 how
 has
 your
 leadership


style
 changed
 it
 definitely
 evolves
 uh


there's
 a
 big
 difference
 between


becoming
 CEO
 at
 a
 company
 where
 you
 had


worked
 for
 14


years
 and
 being
 a
 new
 CEO
 to
 a
 new


company
 in
 a
 new
 industry
 quite


frankly
 and
 I
 I
 frequently
 say
 to
 my


team
 kind
 of
 what
 got
 us
 here
 doesn't


get
 you
 to
 there


when
 I
 was
 named
 CEO
 at
 USG
 corporation


which
 was
 publicly
 traded
 at
 the
 time


you
 know
 I
 knew
 the
 team
 I
 knew
 the


business
 I
 visited
 every
 plant
 in
 the


world
 I
 knew
 our
 customers
 I
 knew
 the


relationships
 but
 we
 still
 had
 the


opportunity
 to
 sharpen
 and
 hone
 our


strategy
 and
 um
 I
 had
 the
 opportunity
 to


spend
 time
 you
 know
 with
 our
 largest


shareholders
 and
 uh
 hear
 what
 they


thought


about
 coming
 into
 a
 private
 company
 as


CEO


uh
 it
 gave
 me
 the
 latitude
 to
 learn
 the


industry
 to
 learn
 the
 team
 to
 learn
 the


company
 to
 get
 out
 there
 and
 visit
 and


we
 didn't
 we
 had
 one
 shareholder
 so


spending
 the
 time
 to
 think
 about
 what


types
 of


shareholders
 um
 would
 be
 most
 attracted


to
 our
 business
 model
 and
 how
 did
 we
 get


out
 there
 um
 in
 front
 of
 them
 uh
 to
 have


them
 you
 know
 support
 our
 IPO
 that
 was


an
 interesting
 kind
 of
 leadership


assessment
 an
 interesting
 way
 to
 shape


my
 leadership
 team
 into
 thinking
 about


our
 next
 stage
 of
 growth
 um
 so
 the


leadership
 has
 definit
 you
 my
 leadership


my
 style
 has
 definitely
 evolved
 over


time
 and
 it
 is
 different
 depending
 on


the
 circumstances
 that
 you're
 in
 I
 I


also
 say
 I
 think
 the
 longer
 you're
 in


this
 chair
 the
 less
 patient
 you
 become


why
 is
 that
 I
 think
 you
 see


patterns
 and
 I'm
 a
 pretty
 decisive


person
 and
 when
 you
 start
 to
 see
 a


pattern
 of
 something
 that
 is


familiar
 that
 you've
 already
 decided


three
 years
 ago
 or
 five
 years
 ago
 you've


seen
 this
 before
 um
 you
 just
 become
 less


patient


about
 getting
 to
 that
 conclusion
 and
 and


having
 it
 executed
 is
 that
 about
 people


I
 think
 it's
 it's
 people
 it's
 um
 but


it's
 more
 than
 that
 it's
 you
 know


relationships
 with
 the
 board
 it's


relationships
 with
 shareholders
 it's


relationships
 with
 customers
 um
 you
 know


I
 think
 being
 decisive
 and
 having
 a
 bias


toward
 action
 and
 uh
 moving
 with
 speed


uh
 is
 is
 extremely
 important
 and
 it's


probably
 why
 I've
 become
 less
 patient


over
 time
 I
 kind
 of
 thought
 that
 age


brought
 some
 patience


I
 had
 a
 stone
 on
 my
 desk
 for
 years
 that


somebody
 gave
 me
 with
 the
 word
 patience


written
 on
 it
 to
 remind
 me
 that
 I
 needed


it
 um
 so
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 ever
 had
 it
 um


so
 aging
 may
 have
 helped
 with
 some


perspective
 there
 but
 it's
 uh
 not


something
 that
 I've
 ever
 been
 known
 to


have
 are
 you
 a
 better
 leader
 now
 than


you
 were
 absolutely
 absolutely
 in
 what


ways
 I've
 learned
 one
 of
 the
 challenges


of
 leadership
 particularly
 when
 you're


named
 CEO
 is
 how
 your
 voice


carries


and
 learning
 the
 lesson
 that
 you
 can
 say


something
 and
 it's
 interpreted
 in
 a


really
 unintentional
 fashion
 and
 I
 yeah


I've
 told
 this
 story
 a
 number
 of
 times


and
 it
 it
 it
 really
 hit
 home
 for
 me
 uh


early
 in
 being
 a
 CEO
 uh
 so
 I
 was
 at
 my


former
 company
 I
 got
 in
 the
 elevator
 and


I
 was
 with
 one
 of
 our
 Engineers
 who
 was


from
 a
 plant
 and
 he
 was
 wearing
 a
 really


nice
 car
 heart
 jacket
 and
 it
 was


embroidered
 on
 the
 sleeve
 uh
 they
 had


won
 uh
 best
 employer
 for
 the
 region
 and


I
 said
 wow
 that
 is
 a
 nice
 jacket
 that
 is


so
 great
 you
 guys
 won
 that
 award
 and


what
 wow
 what
 a
 nice
 jacket
 car
 heart


jackets
 are
 really
 nice
 and
 and
 he
 said


thank
 you
 45
 minutes
 later
 I
 got
 an


email
 from
 the
 plant
 manager
 that
 said


hey
 Jenny
 what
 size
 are
 you
 and
 I


thought
 well
 I
 wasn't
 trolling
 to
 get
 a


free
 jacket
 but
 then
 I
 realized
 that
 my


voice
 carried
 my
 voice
 carried
 that
 that


engineer
 felt
 seen
 and
 heard
 that
 he


called
 his
 boss
 to
 say
 hey
 Jenny


complimented
 Us
 in
 the
 elevator
 and
 that


that
 mattered
 and
 it
 it
 really
 taught
 me


this
 this
 lesson
 that
 you
 can
 say
 things


and
 people
 interpret
 it
 different
 ways


and
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they're


as
 much
 as
 possible
 interpreting
 it
 in


the
 way
 that
 you
 intended
 and
 so
 to
 be


very
 careful
 about
 your
 voice
 that
 it


can't
 be
 used
 in
 an
 unintended
 fashion


and
 and
 that's
 something
 I've
 become


more
 deliberate
 about
 as
 a
 CEO
 than
 I


was
 in
 my
 early
 days
 what
 are
 some
 of


the
 ways
 you
 use
 it
 in
 an
 intendent


fashion
 it's
 funny
 my
 father
 was
 a
 high


school
 football
 coach
 and
 you
 know
 he


had
 you
 know
 colorful
 expressions
 and


great
 language
 but
 he
 was
 a
 pretty
 um


tempered
 guy
 and
 I
 remember
 the
 story
 I


I
 I
 tell
 the
 story
 I
 remember
 a
 time
 at


a
 big
 game
 and
 he
 threw
 his
 jacket
 in


the
 air
 and
 he
 was
 you
 know
 yelling
 at


the
 rough
 and
 the
 next
 morning
 we
 won


the
 game
 and
 the
 next
 morning
 I
 said
 to


him
 I'm
 like
 wow
 dad
 you
 were
 really
 mad


and
 he
 said


no
 he
 said
 but
 sometimes
 you
 got
 to


throw
 the
 jacket
 they
 need
 to
 know
 that


you
 know
 that
 they
 got
 it


wrong
 and
 I
 think
 that
 using
 your


leadership
 voice
 effectively
 to
 you
 know


respectfully
 and
 honestly
 point
 out


where
 there's
 opportunities
 for


improvement
 sometimes
 you
 got
 to
 throw


that
 jacket
 most
 of
 the
 time
 you
 don't


and
 if
 you
 throw
 it
 too
 often
 people


will
 stop
 paying
 attention
 to
 it
 and
 so


it's
 just
 it's
 I
 I
 I
 think
 about
 my


father
 often
 and
 I
 think
 about
 that


story
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 every
 once
 in
 a


blue
 moon
 I
 think
 it's
 time
 to
 throw
 a


jacket
 but
 most
 of
 the
 time
 you
 find


another
 way
 to
 communicate
 appropriately


what
 about
 uh
 using
 the
 voice
 in
 the


opposite
 way
 so
 compliments
 and
 praise
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 incredible


things
 by
 having
 being
 a
 leadership


position
 is
 just
 how
 you
 can
 how
 you
 can


use
 it
 to
 really
 see
 people
 uh
 you
 know


lift
 them
 up
 uh
 a
 compliment
 from
 you


means
 more
 than
 from
 some
 other
 people


it's
 a
 wonderful
 thing
 right
 it
 is
 it
 is


and
 I'm
 GNA
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 two


different
 examples
 of
 times
 where
 I've


I've
 really
 felt
 this
 and
 and
 agree
 that


it's
 very
 important
 one
 was
 um
 long


before
 I
 was
 CEO
 I
 was
 CIO
 at
 my
 former


company
 and
 we
 were
 doing
 awards
 for
 uh


employees
 across
 the
 organization


and
 a
 woman
 that
 that
 received
 an
 award


who
 I
 had
 spoken
 about
 afterwards
 wrote


me
 a
 note
 and
 the
 note
 said
 Jenny
 I
 knew


I
 was
 getting
 the
 award
 I
 knew
 that
 you


were
 going
 to
 announce
 it
 and
 I
 knew
 you


were
 going
 to
 say
 a
 few
 words
 about
 me


what
 I
 didn't
 know
 was
 how
 good
 it
 was


going
 to
 make
 me
 feel
 and
 how
 long
 I


continue
 to
 feel
 that
 way
 and
 I
 I
 I've


always
 kept
 that
 note
 because
 I
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 a
 great
 example
 of
 people


never
 forget
 the
 way
 you
 make
 them
 feel


de
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 continued
 to


do
 when
 I
 joined
 UL
 that
 my
 predecessor


had
 done
 was
 send
 a
 Blog
 once
 a
 week
 to


all


employees


and
 uh
 I'm
 insistent
 that
 you
 know
 it's


just
 it's
 whatever's
 on
 my
 mind
 it
 can


tie
 to
 what's
 happening
 in
 the
 company


but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 really
 like
 to


do
 if
 I've
 been
 out
 traveling
 or
 if
 I've


been
 in
 a
 meeting
 and
 somebody's


presented
 something
 interesting
 I
 really


like
 to
 Showcase
 and
 highlight
 our


employ
 employees
 just
 through
 my
 blog


and
 I
 get
 some
 great
 notes
 back
 from


people
 of
 wow
 thank
 you
 for
 noticing
 or


oh
 our
 team
 was
 so
 proud
 that
 you


mentioned
 them
 and
 that
 positive


reinforcement
 I
 mean
 we've
 got
 15,000


employees
 I
 always
 say
 everybody
 rolls


out
 of
 bed
 every
 day
 wanting
 to
 do
 a


good
 job
 and
 they
 want
 to
 feel
 like


their
 work
 matters
 and
 they
 matter
 and


the
 more
 that
 I
 can
 highlight
 and


showcase
 that
 uh
 I
 think
 uh
 just
 the


better
 the
 culture
 is
 and
 the


organization
 is
 do
 you
 think
 people
 tell


you
 the
 truth
 I
 think
 the
 more
 senior


you
 get
 in
 a
 company
 the
 more
 deliberate


you
 have
 to
 be
 about
 finding
 people
 who


are
 willing
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 truth
 uh
 I


think
 having
 people
 around
 you
 uh
 the


ones
 who
 come
 in
 and
 tell
 you
 what
 you


need
 to
 hear
 whether
 or
 not
 you
 want
 to


hear
 it
 is
 extremely
 important
 and


knowing
 who
 those
 people
 are
 uh
 and


ensuring
 that
 you
 provide
 the


opportunity
 for
 them
 to
 provide
 that


input
 is
 extremely
 important
 uh
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 only
 want
 to
 tell


you
 what
 you
 want
 to
 hear
 and
 and
 that


is
 a
 recipe
 for
 disaster
 so
 we
 are


introducing
 a
 new
 award
 uh
 in
 our


company
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 ice
 hockey


puck
 and
 it's
 called
 the
 straight
 Puck


award
 okay
 basically
 for
 people
 who
 are


telling
 me
 things
 I
 you
 know
 uh
 the
 real


truth
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 quite
 fun
 we're


kicking
 it
 off
 now
 so
 you
 can
 actually


physically
 give
 them
 a
 puck
 you
 know


it's
 just
 like
 hey
 thanks
 for
 the


straight
 Puck
 go
 har
 is
 a
 straight
 PU


and
 uh
 so
 we
 see
 how
 that
 goes
 I
 think


it's
 quite
 fun
 actually
 oh
 I
 think


that's
 excellent
 well
 how
 would
 you


describe
 the
 corporate
 culture
 our


corporate
 culture
 is
 13
 years
 old
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 long-standing


Traditions
 as
 well
 as
 habits
 uh
 we
 have


some
 employees
 they've
 been
 here
 45


years
 40
 years
 35
 years
 and
 and
 these


are
 thought
 leaders
 and
 and
 they


understand
 the
 science
 and
 the


engineering
 and
 the
 business
 and
 and


they've
 you
 know
 they're
 just
 really
 fun


and
 interesting
 to
 be
 around


and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 our
 culture
 you


know
 grounded
 you
 know
 founded
 by
 the


you
 know
 Underwriters
 electrical
 Bureau


uh
 can
 be
 risk


averse
 one
 of
 the
 things
 and
 and
 that's


good
 for
 our
 customers
 our
 customers


always
 say
 like
 you
 know
 somebody's
 got


to
 tell
 us
 the
 bad
 news
 that
 our
 product


you
 know
 isn't
 safe
 or
 isn't
 working
 um


glad
 you're
 here
 to
 do
 that
 but


balancing
 out
 evolving
 our
 culture
 into


um
 you
 know
 risk
 appropriate
 at
 the


right
 speed
 is
 really
 important
 uh
 but


one
 of
 the
 greatest
 things
 about
 our


culture
 is
 how
 connected
 our
 employees


are
 to
 our
 mission
 uh
 in
 our
 Employee


Engagement
 survey
 over
 80
 I
 think
 85%
 of


our
 employees
 uh
 said
 that
 our
 mission


matters
 to
 them
 personally
 working
 for
 a


safer
 World
 matters
 to
 them
 and
 I
 think


that
 creates
 this
 unification
 of
 no


matter
 what
 country
 you're
 in
 what
 lab


you're
 working
 in
 what
 customer
 you're


working
 with
 you
 feel
 that
 same
 sense
 of


purpose
 now
 you
 work
 for
 a
 safer
 world


and
 um
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 were
 a
 lifeguard


for
 seven
 years
 so
 are
 you
 like
 totally


paranoid
 about
 safety
 are
 you
 just
 like


one
 of
 these
 people
 who
 are
 afraid
 of


everything
 or
 I'm
 not
 afraid
 of


everything
 but
 I
 am
 my
 I
 have
 two


daughters
 they're
 in
 their
 20s
 and
 when


I
 was
 named
 to
 this
 job
 they
 said
 the


headline
 should
 be
 mom
 safety
 freak
 runs


safety
 company
 and
 I
 have
 always
 been


attuned
 to
 you
 know
 managing
 risk


appropriately
 risk
 management
 is


important
 and


you
 working
 in
 a
 manufacturing


environment
 a
 heavy
 industrial


environment
 you
 know
 we
 mined
 we
 had


paper
 mills
 we
 had
 you
 know
 wallboard


flying
 off
 lines
 at
 600
 feet
 a
 minute


you
 know
 dangerous
 environments
 plant


man
 you
 know
 we
 had
 a
 plant
 manage


couple
 people
 who
 were
 missing
 a
 hand


and
 you
 know
 other
 terrible
 things
 can


happen
 to
 people
 in
 these
 environments


so
 I've
 always
 been
 attuned
 to
 focusing


on
 how
 do
 you
 eliminate
 unnecessary


risks
 you
 know
 life
 is
 full
 of
 risks
 but


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 you
 know
 better
 to


wear
 a
 bike
 helmet
 than
 not
 why
 do
 you


think
 your
 daughters
 uh
 think
 you
 are
 a


safety
 freak
 cuz
 I
 made
 them
 wear
 bike


helmets
 when
 they
 were
 like
 six
 years


old
 riding
 their


tricycles
 but
 um
 but
 I
 think
 they
 also


they
 know
 that
 I've
 always
 and
 it's
 it's


probably
 the
 project
 manager
 at
 me
 as


well
 that
 you
 just
 constantly
 have
 to


think
 about
 you
 know
 expect
 the
 best


plan
 for
 the
 worst
 do
 you
 like
 hold
 the


handrail
 when
 you
 go
 down
 the
 stairs
 uh


three
 points
 of
 contact
 absolutely
 and


in
 fact
 um
 we
 do
 safety
 moments
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 all
 of
 our
 meetings
 and
 we


pick
 different
 topics
 and
 we
 leave
 it
 up


to
 the
 leaders
 but
 if
 you
 are
 walking


down
 a
 hallway
 with
 me
 and
 I
 see
 you
 on


a
 stair
 rail
 uh
 and
 you're
 not
 holding


if
 staircase
 and
 you're
 not
 holding
 the


rail
 you're
 going
 to
 hear
 me
 say
 hey


three
 points
 of
 contact
 it
 will
 save


your
 teeth
 maybe
 a
 concussion
 what
 is


that
 drives
 you
 the
 thing
 that
 drives
 me


I've


always
 I've
 always
 been
 a
 leader
 when
 I


was
 a
 little
 kid
 I
 organized
 the


neighborhood
 into
 you
 know
 teams
 or


games
 or
 put
 on
 the
 show
 I've
 always


wanted
 to
 feel
 like
 I
 was
 making
 a


difference
 in
 every
 job
 I've
 ever
 had


you
 know
 I
 wanted
 to
 feel
 like
 there
 was


a
 connection
 into
 uh
 a
 way
 that
 was


making
 the
 world
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


better
 place
 uh
 you
 know
 I'm
 driven
 by


uh
 being
 a
 mother
 I
 look
 at
 my
 daughters


and
 I
 hope
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 they
 have


even
 greater
 opportunities
 than
 I
 have


had
 and
 I
 hope
 that
 as
 I'm
 paying
 it


forward
 for
 others
 in
 the
 work


environment
 that
 others
 are
 doing
 the


same
 for
 the
 Next
 Generation
 for
 all
 of


our
 kids
 what's
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 do


in
 the
 morning
 first
 thing
 I
 do
 in
 the


morning
 is
 drink
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 I
 am
 a


non-functioning
 human
 being
 without
 that


that
 caffeine
 uh
 and
 then
 I
 usually
 when


do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 about
 5:00


every
 day
 I
 was
 not
 naturally
 a
 morning


person
 but
 being
 in
 the
 construction


industry
 for
 almost
 two
 decades
 turned


me
 into
 that
 and
 then
 once
 I
 became
 head


of
 international
 having
 teams
 all
 over


the
 world
 I've
 just
 learned
 you
 you
 got


to
 be
 up
 that
 early
 and
 check
 email
 and


make
 sure
 that
 everything
 is
 uh
 staying


afloat
 everywhere
 what
 are
 some


important
 pieces
 of
 advice
 that
 you
 have


got
 during
 the
 years
 from
 people
 you


respect


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 pieces
 of
 advice
 is


take
 the
 time
 to
 listen
 if
 if
 you
 take


that
 time
 back
 to
 do
 people
 tell
 you
 the


truth
 if
 you
 take
 the
 time
 you
 will


learn
 what
 matters
 and
 you
 will
 learn


what
 motivates
 and
 drives
 people
 so


taking
 the
 time
 to
 listen
 early
 in
 my


career
 I
 had
 someone
 point
 out
 to
 me


that
 I
 was
 always
 in
 a
 rush
 you
 know


back
 to
 that
 lack
 of
 patience
 and
 that


sitting
 down
 and
 starting
 a
 meeting
 and


and
 saying
 you
 know
 just
 taking
 the
 the


30
 seconds
 you
 know
 hey
 how
 was
 your


weekend
 how
 was
 your
 daughter's
 school


play
 how
 was
 you
 know
 how's
 your


birthday
 what
 are
 your
 plans
 and
 just


listening
 because
 you
 can
 learn
 so
 much


and
 the
 next
 great
 piece
 of
 advice
 that


I
 give
 to
 uh
 every
 uh
 you
 know
 kind
 of


post
 col
 newly
 employed
 is
 become
 a


really
 good
 project
 manager
 what
 does


that
 mean
 it's
 it's
 figure
 out
 first
 and


foremost
 what
 problem
 are
 you
 trying
 to


solve
 and
 then
 how
 much
 time
 does
 that


take
 what
 resources
 do
 you
 need
 do
 you


need
 money
 what
 issues
 are
 going
 to


arise
 what
 risks
 are
 out
 there
 what


communication
 is
 needed
 with
 others
 to


get
 it
 done
 to
 get
 that
 problem
 solved


and
 then
 always
 come
 back
 to
 did
 you


solve
 that
 problem
 was
 it
 the
 right


problem
 to
 solve
 and
 then
 how
 do
 you


close
 that
 Loop
 and
 do
 it
 again
 because


so
 many
 times
 people
 solve
 the
 wrong


problem
 absolutely
 well
 uh
 Jennifer
 you


have
 solved
 lots
 of
 very
 important


problems
 over
 the
 Year
 big
 thank
 you

for
 making
 the
 world
 a
 safer
 place

 a


big
 thanks

 being

 a


pleasure
