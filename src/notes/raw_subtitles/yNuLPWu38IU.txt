[Music]


hi
 there
 I've
 just
 had
 the
 most


incredible
 experience
 of
 my
 life
 having


been
 allowed
 to
 interview
 saan
 Adella


the
 CEO
 of
 Microsoft
 which
 is
 now
 the


most
 valuable
 company
 in
 the
 world
 wow


please
 tune
 in
 SAA
 you
 are
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 most
 valuable
 company
 in
 the
 world


what's
 what's
 on
 your
 mind
 these


days
 look
 to
 me
 um
 Nikolai
 first
 of
 all


it's
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 and
 um
 have


this
 conversation


what's
 top
 of
 mind
 for
 me
 is
 twofold


right
 one
 is
 I'm
 grounded
 in
 the
 fact


that
 in
 our
 business
 in
 Tech
 business


now
 this
 is
 my
 32nd
 year
 at


Microsoft
 um
 I
 know
 that
 for
 a
 fact
 that


there's
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 a
 franchise


value
 and
 so
 that
 means
 every
 day
 you


have
 to
 get
 up
 and
 hopefully
 you're


doing
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


relevant
 tomorrow
 um
 and
 so
 to
 me
 that's


sort
 of
 perhaps
 the
 biggest
 lesson


learned
 over
 all
 these
 decades
 and
 years


and
 so
 here
 we
 are
 on
 what
 is
 is


essentially
 a
 complete
 new
 platform


shift
 uh
 that
 we're
 in
 the
 midst
 of


right
 I
 kind
 of
 say
 it's
 my
 32nd
 year


but
 it's
 year
 two
 of
 my
 fourth
 platform


shift
 and
 so
 what's
 on
 mind
 is
 like
 okay


what
 is
 this
 platform
 shift
 really
 all


about
 and
 as
 a
 company
 can
 we
 be
 all
 in


and
 innovate
 right
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 uh
 when
 I
 say
 there's
 no


franchise
 value
 it
 also
 means
 that
 you


get
 to
 play
 for
 it
 all
 up
 again
 even
 the


battles
 we
 won
 and
 the
 battles
 we
 lost


are
 all
 up
 for
 grab
 again
 and
 so


therefore
 um
 there's
 a
 freshness
 to
 it


so
 what's
 on
 my
 mind
 is
 you
 know
 that


ability
 to
 ground
 myself
 back
 yet
 on
 on


another
 platform
 shift
 and
 it's
 exciting


the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 no
 franchise


value
 does
 that
 make
 you
 nervous


absolutely
 I
 mean
 it
 should
 make
 every


one
 of
 us
 nervous
 right
 at
 least
 that's


why
 the
 tech
 is
 so
 exciting
 right
 it's


sort
 of
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 two
 sides


to
 the
 same
 coin
 right
 one
 is
 you're


nervous
 and
 it's
 exciting
 so
 therefore


you
 can't
 rest
 uh
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


hey
 who
 wants
 to
 be
 in
 in
 a
 business


that
 you
 know
 where
 you
 don't
 get
 to


reinvent
 yourself
 again
 and
 again


absolutely
 do
 you
 think
 we
 look
 at
 Tech


in
 two
 narrow
 a
 sense
 I
 mean
 how
 can


technology
 really
 be
 a
 driver
 for
 the


next
 level
 of
 economic
 growth
 yeah


that's
 a
 great
 great
 question
 I
 think
 a


lot
 about
 that
 right
 which
 is
 uh
 in
 some


sense
 if
 you
 take
 at
 a
 GDP
 level
 uh
 Tech


spend


narrowly
 defined
 is
 probably
 4


5%
 uh
 so
 the
 question
 is
 what
 is


happening
 with
 the
 other
 95%
 so
 one
 of


the
 ways
 I've
 always
 thought
 about
 the


prospects
 of
 any
 new
 technological


Paradigm
 or
 platform
 shift
 like
 take
 AI


let's
 I
 if
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 next


big
 general
 purpose
 technology
 for
 me


the
 real
 opportunity
 is
 let's
 say
 Tech


spend
 goes
 from
 5
 to
 10%
 over
 the
 next


you
 know
 five
 years
 or
 what
 have
 you
 or


10
 years
 then
 what
 happens
 to
 the
 other


90%
 And
 the
 pi
 does
 it
 become
 bigger


right
 does
 the
 you
 know
 do
 we
 have
 a


breakthrough
 in
 healthc
 care
 driven
 by


AI
 do
 we
 have
 a
 breakthrough
 in
 material


signs
 and
 energy
 transition
 because
 of


uh
 AI
 uh
 and
 the
 list
 goes
 on
 right
 so


to
 me
 that
 is
 fundamentally
 the
 way
 I


think
 about
 it
 right
 which
 is
 I
 I
 think


that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 might
 be


most
 important
 for
 us
 is
 to
 consider
 how


a
 general
 purpose
 technology
 somebody


was
 telling
 me
 this
 right
 which
 is
 in


the
 height
 of
 the
 Industrial


Revolution
 uh
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom
 they


spent
 10%
 of
 their
 GDP
 building
 the


railroads
 and
 obviously
 the
 railroads


not
 just
 didn't
 is
 not
 about
 the


railroads
 it
 was
 about
 the
 entire


economy
 of
 the
 United
 Kingdom
 and
 so


something
 like
 that
 I
 think
 is
 what
 uh


that's
 the
 unit
 of
 analysis
 at
 least
 for


me
 as
 to
 how
 Tech
 and
 its
 future
 will


impact
 the
 in
 a
 broader
 society
 and


economy
 now
 um
 Google
 had
 almost
 all
 the


top
 AI
 people
 and
 you
 suddenly
 got
 ahead


partly
 due
 to
 your
 partnership
 with
 open


AI
 now
 how
 did
 that
 come


about
 I
 mean
 um
 to
 me
 the
 way
 I
 came
 at


this
 Nikolai
 is
 just
 very
 simple
 which


is
 obviously
 we
 have
 been
 like
 I
 think


the
 very
 first
 thing
 Microsoft
 research


did
 in
 1995
 when
 it
 was
 formed
 was
 some


stuff
 around
 speech
 right
 in
 fact
 I


think
 we
 hired
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 folks
 from


CMU
 and
 so
 we've
 been
 at
 this
 AI
 thing


in
 its
 variety
 of
 different
 forms


forever
 um
 and
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


when
 I
 met
 with
 the
 open
 AI
 folks
 and


Sam
 and
 Greg
 and
 crew
 uh
 back
 in
 you


know
 I
 would
 say
 when
 they
 were
 working


even
 on
 the
 Dota
 2
 contest
 and
 what
 have


you
 uh
 was
 to
 sort
 of
 say
 wow
 they
 have


a
 new
 different
 approach
 to
 things
 and


we
 wanted
 a
 partner
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 I've
 always
 looked
 at


over
 my
 years
 at
 Microsoft
 is
 look
 for


high
 ambition
 um
 Technology
 Innovation


companies
 right
 whether
 it
 you
 know
 or


and
 partnership
 like
 whether
 it's
 Intel


and
 windows
 came
 together
 and
 that
 was


successful
 sap
 and
 SQL
 Server
 it
 came


together
 and
 was
 successful
 so
 I'm


always
 looking
 for
 partners
 that
 we
 can


innovate
 with
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 found
 in


uh
 Sam
 and
 team
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 you
 know


at
 that
 time
 it
 was
 not
 like
 it
 was
 a
 it


was
 a
 real
 uh
 in
 the
 dark
 right
 it
 is


not
 like
 oh
 wow
 this
 is
 a
 sure
 sure


thing
 everybody
 now
 talks
 about
 it
 as
 if


uh
 you
 know
 this
 is
 the
 issue
 with
 tech


right
 which
 is
 uh
 long
 before
 it's


conventional
 wisdom
 you
 have
 to
 be
 all


in
 and
 hope
 it
 works
 um
 and
 this
 is
 one


of
 those
 things
 where
 we
 backed
 it
 long


before
 it
 was
 conventional
 wisdom
 um
 and


here
 we
 are
 but
 I
 don't
 take
 you
 know


like
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 severe
 amount


of
 competition
 you
 know
 Google's
 a
 very


competent
 company
 and
 obviously
 they


have
 both
 the
 talent
 and
 the
 compute
 and


they
 have
 you
 know
 they're
 the


vertically
 integrated
 player
 in
 this


right
 they
 have
 everything
 from
 data
 to


Silicon
 to
 models
 to
 have
 products
 and


distribution
 and
 there's
 others
 as
 well


and
 so
 yeah
 we
 will
 have
 significant


amount
 of
 competition
 and
 I
 think
 if


anything
 Microsoft's
 partnership
 with


open
 AI
 is
 bringing
 more
 competition
 to


otherwise
 what
 would
 have
 been
 a
 default


Google
 should
 have
 be
 the
 default
 winner


uh
 and
 if
 we
 partner
 well
 and
 we


innovate
 well
 we
 can
 bring
 some


competition
 to
 them
 so
 if
 you
 look
 3
 to


five
 years
 from
 now
 where
 is
 Microsoft


in
 this
 whole
 AI
 ecosystem
 you
 think
 so


to
 me
 I
 think
 about
 this
 in
 the
 fullness


of
 the
 stack
 right
 so
 I
 want
 us
 to
 have


first
 and
 foremost
 the
 best
 AI


infrastructure
 uh
 so
 that
 means
 when
 it


comes
 to
 Azure
 whether
 it's
 for
 training


whether
 it's
 for
 inference
 to
 have


fantastic
 infrastructure
 we'll
 partner


with
 Nvidia
 we'll
 partner
 with
 AMD
 we'll


have
 our
 own
 own
 silicon
 uh
 we
 will
 have


our
 own
 system
 architecture
 we
 will
 take


the
 best
 system
 architecture
 Innovation


from
 Jensen
 and
 Lisa
 and
 others
 who
 may


come
 along
 and
 make
 sure
 Azure
 is


serving
 the
 needs
 of
 open
 AI
 serving
 the


needs
 of
 Mistral
 uh
 serving
 the
 needs
 of


fi
 that
 we
 are
 building
 right
 which
 is


the
 small
 language
 model
 so
 that's
 kind


of
 the
 first
 uh
 thing
 that
 we
 want
 to
 do


which
 is
 the
 best
 work
 um
 in
 being
 able


to
 build
 the
 infrastructure
 out
 for
 both


training
 and
 inference
 and
 then
 the
 next


layer
 up
 we
 want
 to
 have
 like
 the
 entire


data
 tier
 right
 so
 you
 can
 imagine
 as


these
 models
 and
 model
 capabilities


become
 uh
 you
 know
 more
 capable
 I
 think


the
 data
 tier
 will
 be
 completely
 uh


redone
 uh
 right
 we've
 talked
 with
 the


retrieval
 augmented
 generation
 already


you
 have
 all
 these
 things
 where
 whether


it's
 embeddings
 vctor
 search
 how
 do
 you


chunk
 data
 such
 that
 retrieval
 augmented


generation
 can
 work
 well
 so
 that's
 an


entire
 l
 layer
 or
 when
 contact
 lens


become
 bigger
 that's
 a
 different
 sort
 of


data
 layer
 like
 what's
 the
 throughput


between
 data
 and
 your
 inference
 Fleet
 uh


how
 do
 you
 sort
 of
 think
 about
 that
 so


therefore
 we
 will
 innovate
 on
 the
 data


layer
 and
 then
 of
 course
 on
 top
 of
 it
 is


where
 um
 we
 will
 innovate
 on
 our
 uh


co-pilots
 one
 of
 the
 first
 products
 we


built
 was
 get
 up
 co-pilot
 in
 fact
 my


entire
 confidence
 in
 this
 generation
 of


AI
 started
 when
 I
 started
 seeing
 from


GPD
 3
 to
 35
 and
 that
 implementation
 in


GitHub
 uh
 and
 so
 we
 now
 have
 you
 know


not
 only
 GitHub
 co-pilot
 we
 have


co-pilot
 for
 M
 all
 knowledge
 work
 in


Microsoft
 365
 we
 have
 co-pilots
 for


these
 functions
 whether
 it's
 service
 or


sales
 or
 Finance
 uh
 so
 we're
 going
 to


innovate
 in
 our
 app
 layer
 uh
 on
 our
 own


and
 so
 that's
 I
 think
 fundamentally
 how


I
 look
 at
 it
 it's
 it's
 a
 full
 stack


approach
 uh
 and
 each
 layer
 by
 the
 way


we're
 we
 will
 innovate
 we
 will
 have


Partners
 we
 will
 have
 others
 innovating


there
 will
 be
 competition
 even
 it's
 not


like
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 of
 being


a
 platform
 company
 is
 you
 got
 to
 be


comfortable
 with
 many
 third
 parties


competing
 with
 you
 on
 different
 layers


because
 that
 to
 me
 is
 core
 otherwise
 you


kind
 of
 try
 to
 you
 know
 do
 everything
 in


a
 monolithic
 way
 and
 at
 least
 what
 we've


learned
 over
 the
 years
 is
 the
 best
 thing


to
 do
 is
 to
 keep
 each
 layer
 competitive


on
 its
 own
 you
 said
 in
 the
 beginning


that
 we
 are
 year
 two
 into
 this
 Paradigm


Shift
 uh
 how
 do
 you
 see
 it
 compared
 to


other
 technological
 breakthroughs
 that


we
 that
 you've
 been
 through
 so
 at
 least


the
 four
 I've
 seen
 Nicolai
 is
 um


obviously
 PC
 client
 server
 both
 what


happened
 on
 the
 you
 know
 PC
 and
 the


server
 side
 that
 was
 my
 first
 that's


kind
 of
 when
 I
 joined
 92
 where
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 that
 uh
 then
 there
 was
 the


Web
 Internet
 uh
 and
 then
 there
 was


mobile
 cloud
 and
 so
 AI
 is
 the
 fourth
 um


I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things
 is


each
 one
 of
 these
 built
 on
 the
 previous


right
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 web
 would


have
 happened
 if
 there
 was
 not
 and
 you
 B


his
 PC
 after
 all
 the
 first
 time
 I
 saw


MOS
 uh
 you
 know
 was
 as
 a
 browser
 on
 top


of
 Windows
 right
 so
 and
 then
 Netscape


came
 about
 and
 then
 uh
 IE
 and
 what
 have


you
 and
 so
 therefore
 I
 think
 um
 you
 sort


of
 see
 each
 one
 of
 these
 births
 the
 next


uh
 and
 then
 it
 goes
 beyond
 uh
 what


births
 you
 right
 that's
 I
 think
 the
 the


real
 thing
 right
 right
 now
 we're
 seeing


that
 right
 which
 is
 the
 cloud
 um
 as
 we


know
 of
 it
 and
 mobile


uh
 and
 PCS
 on
 the
 edge
 have
 really


birthed
 the
 AI
 age
 and
 the
 question
 is


what
 happens
 next
 uh
 right
 which
 is
 does


it
 go
 beyond
 that
 and
 that
 I
 think
 is


going
 I
 mean
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 AI
 that


is
 not
 just
 what
 about
 cognitive
 work
 AI


that
 is
 also
 going
 to
 accelerate
 science


so
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 a
 exciting
 space


uh
 AI
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 embodied
 in


the
 real
 world
 so
 what
 may
 happen
 in


robotics
 is
 an
 exciting
 space
 and
 so


there
 is
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that
 are


going
 to
 happen
 over
 time
 uh
 but
 clearly


yes
 this
 is
 year
 two
 of
 a
 complete
 new


paradigm
 that
 obviously
 reinforces
 what


happened
 pre
 or
 bills
 on
 what
 happened


previously
 but
 also
 also
 is
 showing


early
 signs
 of
 what
 happens
 next
 if


there
 had
 been
 no
 shortage
 of
 um
 uh


chips
 now
 would
 the
 development
 have


gone
 even


faster
 that's
 a
 good
 question
 in
 the


sense
 of
 scaling
 laws
 right
 so
 there
 are


two
 sides
 to
 it
 right
 there's
 the
 the


training
 side
 and
 the
 inference
 side
 on


the
 training
 side
 clearly
 uh
 compute
 and


compute
 scale
 and
 the
 scaling
 laws
 have


proven
 to
 be
 very
 successful
 U
 and
 the


question
 is
 how
 long
 does
 that
 go
 is


there
 going
 to
 be
 another
 model


architecture
 breakthrough
 or
 what
 have


you
 um
 I
 I
 think
 that
 one
 has
 to
 see


it's
 it's
 unclear
 uh
 but
 we
 definitely


are
 not
 going
 to
 bet
 against
 scaling


laws
 nor
 are
 we
 going
 to
 bet
 against
 uh


or
 not
 are
 we
 going
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is


the
 last
 Model
 architecture
 breakthrough


in
 fact
 a
 great
 example
 of
 it
 is
 even
 uh


what
 what
 we've
 we've
 seen
 even
 with
 uh


our
 small
 language
 model
 Innovation
 like


fi
 right
 which
 is
 we
 are
 able
 to
 create


what
 is


significant
 um


capabilities
 uh
 in
 a
 small
 language


model
 uh
 which
 uh
 doesn't
 require


obviously
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 compute


right
 which
 is
 uh
 like
 just
 like


attention
 is
 everything
 attenti
 is
 all


you
 need
 uh
 textbooks
 is
 all
 you
 need
 I


mean
 that
 sort
 of
 intuitively
 speaks
 to


uh
 how
 I
 think
 Co
 you
 know
 learning
 can


happen
 and
 so
 therefore
 I
 would
 say


uh
 yes
 if
 more
 more
 more
 capacity
 there


is
 in
 the
 world
 the
 chances
 are
 that
 we


will
 be
 able
 to
 make
 progress
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 I
 would
 discount
 a
 real


breakthrough
 uh
 in
 model
 architecture


that
 doesn't
 perhaps
 require
 uh
 the
 same


type
 of
 compute
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 um


at
 least
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 myself


open-minded
 about
 it
 talking
 of
 a
 small


language
 models
 do
 you
 think
 a
 small


country
 like
 Norway
 should
 develop
 its


own


model
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


I've
 studied
 there's
 an
 economist
 out
 of


darthmouth
 his
 name
 is
 Diego
 colan
 and


he
 did
 one
 of
 the
 best
 longitudinal


studies
 uh
 of
 Technology
 diffusion
 uh


and
 the
 fundamental
 conclusion
 um


paraphrasing
 was
 that
 any
 country
 that


wants
 to
 get
 ahead
 should
 one
 first
 make


sure
 that
 they
 don't
 reinvent
 the
 wheel


which
 is
 they
 import
 the
 best
 general


purpose
 technology
 that
 is
 available


in
 and
 then
 on
 top
 of
 it
 build
 value
 ad


so
 I
 think
 for
 example
 U
 even
 on
 for
 no


way
 first
 thing
 I
 would
 do
 is
 if
 we
 feel


like
 for
 whatever
 reason
 these


Foundation
 models
 are
 not
 good
 at


Norwegian
 or
 what
 have
 you
 then
 let's


make
 sure
 they're
 fine-tuning
 and
 and


there
 there
 are
 many
 things
 one
 could
 do


even
 top
 of
 foundation
 models
 like
 an


open
 eye
 model
 or
 a
 Mistral
 or
 what
 have


you
 so
 there
 are
 ways
 you
 can
 add
 unique


knowledge
 unique
 value
 on
 top
 of
 even


what
 exists
 uh
 before
 you
 go
 off
 and
 say


let's
 build
 all
 the
 compute
 all
 of
 it


and
 do
 the
 same
 pre-training
 run
 uh
 you


know
 there's
 no
 nothing
 stopping
 any


country
 from
 doing
 any
 of
 this
 uh
 but


the
 question
 is
 what
 is
 the
 value
 ad
 and


so
 therefore
 I
 think
 that
 you
 start
 from


the
 value
 ad
 and
 then
 back
 into
 whatever


is
 needed
 for
 it
 when
 you
 look
 at
 how
 uh


important
 the
 big
 technology
 companies


have
 become
 in
 in
 geopolitics
 what
 kind


of
 Reflections
 do
 you
 make
 well
 I
 mean


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 um
 to
 two
 things


right
 one
 is
 I'm
 very
 very
 grounded
 on


the
 fact
 that
 we
 are
 a
 multinational


company
 that
 is
 a
 definitely
 in
 this


case
 a
 us-based
 multinational
 company


that
 has
 to
 earn
 permission
 and
 license


to
 operate
 one
 country
 at
 a
 time
 right


so
 therefore
 I
 I
 think
 of
 the
 uh
 we're


not
 nation
 states
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 have


power
 we
 get
 to
 operate
 in
 any
 Nation


based
 on
 our
 ability
 to
 contribute
 to


that
 country's
 progress
 right
 so


whenever
 I
 am
 right
 whether
 I'm
 in


Norway
 or
 or
 I'm
 in
 Jakarta
 or
 or
 New


Delhi
 or
 wherever
 I
 I
 am
 always
 grounded


on
 uh
 fundamentally
 the
 fact
 is
 are
 we


able
 to
 make
 you
 know
 look
 the
 local


politicians
 and
 political
 leadership
 and


Society
 at
 large
 in
 the
 eyes
 and
 say


that
 we
 contributed
 to
 their
 public


sector
 becoming
 more
 efficient
 or
 large


multinational
 companies
 in
 the
 region


becoming
 more
 globally
 competitive


because
 of
 some
 tech
 input
 education


outcome
 Health
 outcome
 small
 businesses


and
 their
 productivity
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 you
 have
 your
 your
 social
 contract


with
 the
 country
 uh
 comes
 from
 your


ability
 to
 contribute
 to
 their
 local


progress
 and
 that
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 we


can
 ever
 be
 Beyond
 geopolitics
 will


exist
 with
 or
 without
 us
 and
 our
 goal


has
 to
 be
 how
 do
 you
 participate
 and


have
 permission
 to


operate
 moving
 on
 in
 your
 book
 um


refresh
 you
 talk
 about
 three
 areas
 you


talk
 about
 AI
 you
 talk
 about
 Quantum


Computing
 and
 mixed
 reality
 so
 um
 how
 uh


what
 kind
 of
 opportunities
 are
 you


seeing
 in
 Quantum


Computing
 it's
 fascinating
 in
 fact
 I
 I


think
 of
 all
 those
 three
 still
 right
 for


example
 when
 I
 think
 about
 um
 mixed


reality
 I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 that's
 an


embodied
 AI
 right
 effectively
 whether


it's
 autonomous
 uh
 Vehicles
 robotics
 or


people
 with
 glasses
 they're
 all
 seeing


the
 real
 world
 is
 the
 prompt
 effectively


so
 your
 real
 World
 understanding
 so


therefore
 I
 think
 of
 in
 the
 generation


of
 AI
 some
 of
 these
 things
 become
 even


more
 interesting
 and
 more
 important
 and


we
 do
 need
 to
 broaden
 the
 aperture


versus
 thinking
 narrowly
 of
 just
 one


device
 or
 one
 form
 factor
 similarly


Quantum
 is
 a
 fascinating
 thing
 when
 I
 I


me
 mentioned
 science
 right
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say
 is
 in
 order


to
 make
 progress
 on
 science
 you
 need


great
 insilico
 simulation
 Quantum
 is
 the


ultimate
 breakthrough
 right
 so
 when
 we


have
 a
 complete
 new
 system
 architecture


cure
 that
 go
 breaks
 free
 of
 the
 one
 Nyon


limitation
 uh
 you
 are
 then
 finally
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 simulate
 something
 like


the
 Dynamics
 of
 a
 cell
 or
 a
 molecule


right
 so
 that
 I
 think
 when
 you
 can
 do


that
 then
 everything
 else
 even
 in
 terms


of
 biology
 becomes
 more
 feasible
 the


interesting
 thing
 is
 AI
 is
 kind
 of
 like


an
 emulator
 of
 that
 simulator
 in
 other


words
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 simplify
 the


search
 space
 and
 we
 see
 this
 already


Nikolai
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 did


recently
 uh
 was
 um
 we
 have
 a
 of
 a
 model


for
 Material
 Science
 which
 we
 use
 to


generate
 a
 new
 novel
 compound
 which
 we


then
 went
 and
 manufactured
 we
 worked


with
 the
 Pacific
 National
 Lab
 locally


here
 to
 effectively
 go
 reduce
 the
 uh
 the


the
 lithium
 content
 uh
 by
 70%
 in
 a
 new


battery
 material
 uh
 and
 produced
 it


right
 not
 just
 conceptualized
 it
 but


simulated
 It
 produced
 it
 and
 so
 to
 me
 uh


something
 where
 like
 Quantum
 plus
 AI
 I


think
 can
 be
 the
 ultimate
 accelerator
 of


science
 uh
 and
 we
 are
 making
 progress


right
 we
 will
 even
 on
 Quantum
 we're


taking
 a
 very
 full
 stack
 approach
 we


have
 our
 software
 stack
 with
 uh
 you
 know


our
 Q
 sharp
 which
 is
 our
 Quantum


programming
 stack
 so
 we
 are
 excited


about
 sort
 of
 the
 progress
 we're
 making


on
 Quantum
 and
 how
 it
 complements
 Ai
 and


where
 does
 the
 gaming
 fit
 into
 this
 yeah


so
 to
 me
 one
 of
 the
 things
 in
 fact


Microsoft
 was
 in
 gaming
 long
 before
 we


you
 know
 we
 were
 into
 windows
 in
 fact


flight
 simulator
 I
 think
 was
 launched


long
 before
 Windows
 was
 launched
 so
 uh


we
 are
 very
 very
 excited
 obviously
 now


with
 Activision
 as
 part
 of
 Microsoft
 we


have
 Mobile
 gaming
 we
 have
 cloud
 gaming


we
 have
 console
 gaming
 PC
 gaming
 so
 we


are
 a
 full
 stack
 game
 publ
 publisher
 uh


as
 well
 as
 a
 game
 systems
 provider
 um


and
 so
 our
 goal
 there
 is
 one
 we're
 in


gaming
 for
 our
 love
 of
 gaming
 right
 so
 I


always
 sort
 of
 say
 we
 should
 never
 be
 in


businesses
 as
 a
 means
 to
 someone
 other


end
 it
 has
 to
 be
 an
 end
 otherwise
 it's


not
 a
 business
 so
 to
 me
 gaming
 uh
 is


something
 where
 we
 want
 to
 bring
 joy
 of


gaming
 that's
 the
 one
 pure
 consumer


entertainment
 category
 I
 love
 the
 fact


that
 gaming
 on
 a
 secular
 basis
 is


probably
 going
 to
 be
 if
 not
 already
 the


biggest
 entertainment
 category
 out
 there


so
 that's
 one
 and
 of
 course
 it
 has
 real


implications
 on
 the
 rest
 of
 it
 right
 if


you
 think
 about
 even
 remember
 it's


interesting
 I'm
 not
 talk
 to
 Jensen
 about


it
 but
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 sort
 of


success
 es
 of


gpus
 was
 fostered
 by
 innovation
 in


gaming
 right
 DX
 which
 was
 the
 Microsoft


graphic
 stack
 is
 what
 made
 gpus
 uh
 an


accelerator
 uh
 right
 after
 all
 the
 gpus


were
 created
 for
 PC
 gaming
 you
 know


gaming
 I
 think
 as
 both
 a
 an
 application


of
 AI
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 game
 testing
 one


of
 the
 first
 areas
 I'm
 very
 excited


about
 is
 games
 are
 so
 complicated
 right


now
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 want
 to


use
 I
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 find
 these
 bugs


in
 these
 even
 closed
 worlds
 uh
 before


they're
 out
 there
 and
 so
 therefore
 we


have
 some
 very
 great
 use
 cases
 there
 uh


but
 beyond
 that
 I
 think
 gaming
 as
 uh


data
 in
 the
 context
 of
 some
 of
 the


Innovation
 uh
 in
 our
 models
 I
 think
 is


going
 to
 be
 important
 do
 you
 game


yourself
 I'm
 a
 you
 know
 a
 light
 gamer
 I


used
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 Civ
 was
 my


favorite
 game
 Age
 of
 Empires
 is
 a


another
 great
 game
 that
 I
 enjoyed
 I
 wish


I
 could
 play
 more
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 from


time
 to
 time
 I
 slip
 into


it
 um
 you
 have
 really
 changed
 the


culture
 at
 Microsoft
 when
 you
 look
 back


what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 most
 important


changes
 you


made
 look
 I
 mean
 Nicola
 I
 sort
 of
 first


of
 all
 I've
 as
 I
 said
 I've
 grown
 up
 all


my
 professional
 career
 for
 most
 part
 is


all
 Microsoft
 so
 uh
 you
 know
 when
 you


say
 I've
 being
 at
 Microsoft
 for
 30
 two


years
 all
 the
 good
 the
 bad
 uh
 I
 was
 part


of
 it
 right
 so
 I
 don't
 sort
 of
 somehow


think
 that
 uh
 I'm
 I
 don't
 repes
 I


represent
 all
 errors
 of
 Microsoft
 yeah


which
 makes
 it
 even
 more
 incredible
 that


you
 have
 made
 these


changes
 yeah
 and
 the
 way
 though
 I
 came


about
 it
 is
 quite
 frankly
 as
 a
 consumate


Insider
 I
 basically
 pattern
 matched
 as


to
 hey
 what
 were
 the
 thing
 when
 were
 we


at
 our
 best
 uh
 what
 was
 the
 cultural
 set


of
 attributes
 that
 helped
 us
 succeed
 and


then
 when
 we
 failed
 what
 were
 the


cultural
 attributes
 that
 caused
 that


failure
 and
 then
 you
 know
 dampen
 this


latter
 and
 amplify
 the
 former
 that
 was


as
 simple
 as
 that
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


look
 back
 even
 in
 my
 you
 know
 career
 at


Microsoft
 when
 we
 first
 became
 the


largest
 market
 cap
 company
 I
 forget
 I


think
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 I
 think
 we


crossed
 G
 you
 know
 people
 on
 our
 campus


prob
 were
 walking
 around
 including
 me


thinking
 oh
 we
 must
 be
 God's
 gifts
 uh
 to


humankind
 uh
 because
 we
 are
 so
 brilliant


and
 what
 have
 you
 except
 what
 we
 needed


to
 be
 grounded
 on
 that
 day
 was
 to
 say


wow
 we
 now
 have
 a
 real
 responsibility
 to


reground
 ourselves
 to
 innovate
 again
 uh


so
 that
 we
 are
 relevant
 in
 the
 future


right
 and
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 I
 was
 lucky


enough
 to
 have
 read
 Carol
 D's
 book
 on


mindset
 which
 is
 around
 child
 psychology


called
 growth
 mindset
 and
 I
 love
 that


book
 I
 read
 it
 more
 on
 the
 context
 of


sort
 of
 our
 children's
 education
 but
 I


must
 say
 I
 got
 educated
 because
 I
 felt


like
 this
 is
 uh
 what
 makes
 uh


individuals
 children
 in
 school
 it's
 very


clear
 right
 it's
 better
 to
 be
 a
 learn
 it


all
 versus
 a
 know
 it
 all
 because
 even
 if


the
 know
 it
 all
 has
 great
 innate


capability
 uh
 the
 learn
 it
 all
 you
 know


even
 if
 they
 start
 from
 behind
 they
 will


surpass
 the
 know-it-all
 right
 that's


sort
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 true
 for
 children
 in


school
 it's
 true
 for
 CEOs
 in
 my
 seat
 uh


it's
 true
 for
 companies
 and
 so
 we
 took


that
 approach


Nikolai
 we
 said
 let's
 be
 a
 learn
 it
 all


versus
 annoy
 it
 all
 uh
 and
 the
 day
 you


say
 you've
 achieved
 that
 cultural


transformation
 means
 you're
 Anno
 it
 all


so
 therefore
 it
 is
 a
 good
 way
 to
 sort
 of


say
 every
 day
 you
 make
 a
 bunch
 of


mistakes
 you
 at
 least
 have
 the
 courage


to
 acknowledge
 them
 and
 continue
 on
 it


and
 so
 it's
 a
 it's
 not
 a
 destination
 you


ever
 reach
 but
 how
 do
 you
 get
 the
 the
 uh


organization
 to
 buy
 into
 that
 how
 do
 you


get
 it
 to
 penetrate
 down
 towards
 the


Perma
 Frost
 in
 the
 organization
 it's
 a


beautiful
 it's
 a
 great
 point
 so
 I
 think


the
 way
 I
 I
 I
 think
 see
 the
 problem
 of


Corporations
 especially
 for
 non-founder


companies
 and
 Founders
 have
 great
 power


and
 great
 followership
 and
 that's
 why
 I


think
 they're
 so
 successful
 or
 at
 least


you
 know
 at
 least
 we
 only
 talk
 about
 the


successful
 Founders
 but
 if
 you
 set
 that


that
 class
 aside
 for
 M
 modals
 like
 me
 uh


it
 can't
 be
 like
 okay
 new
 Dogma
 from
 a


new
 CEO
 and
 more
 corporate
 spe
 it
 has
 to


appeal
 to
 us
 as
 human
 beings
 that's
 why


I
 you
 know
 I
 credit
 more
 of
 this
 work
 uh


by
 Carol
 and
 team
 and
 so
 on
 because
 it's


not
 like
 it
 was
 not
 like
 I
 don't
 think


anybody
 at
 Microsoft
 views
 growth


mindset
 as
 some
 Microsoft
 Dogma
 or


definitely
 not
 Saia
 Adela
 Dogma
 it
 is


something
 that
 speaks
 to
 them
 as
 humans


right
 which
 is
 it's
 good
 for
 them
 as


friends
 colleagues
 Partners
 parents


neighbors
 it
 integrates
 work
 in
 life


they
 can
 bring
 their
 own
 personality
 and


passion
 to
 it
 uh
 and
 benefit
 from
 it


right
 I
 I
 always
 say
 like
 you're
 not
 do


like
 this
 Microsoft
 culture
 of
 growth


mindset
 is
 not
 for
 Microsoft
 it's
 for


you
 and
 if
 you
 you
 should
 only
 practice


it
 if
 you
 feel
 like
 it
 speaks
 to
 your


own
 thriving
 at
 Microsoft
 and
 in
 life
 uh


that's
 I
 think
 what
 I
 attribute
 it
 to


right
 it
 wouldn't
 have
 taken
 off
 if
 it


was
 just
 another
 thing
 that
 is
 a
 topdown


slogan
 uh
 it
 is
 ult
 I
 always
 have


believed
 that
 which
 is
 ultimately
 people


work
 um
 and
 Find
 meaning
 in
 work
 uh
 only


if
 they
 can
 find
 some
 true
 deeper


meaning
 for
 themselves
 and
 so
 that's
 I


think
 what
 I've
 been
 always
 trying
 to


invoke
 well
 they
 clearly
 also
 have
 found


um
 true
 deeper
 meaning
 in
 in
 the
 concept


of
 empathy
 because
 uh
 you
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 that
 and
 you
 say
 that
 it's
 key
 to


Innovation
 and
 Leadership
 and
 so
 on
 so


what
 do
 you
 um
 why
 why
 is
 that
 why
 is
 it


so
 important
 for
 you
 I
 think
 about
 this


as
 um
 I
 think
 most
 people
 think
 of


empathy
 as
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 soft
 skill


that's
 interesting
 in
 the
 context
 of


your
 family
 or
 personal
 life
 and
 works


all
 about
 hardcore
 you
 know
 whatever


right
 but
 that
 but
 I
 look
 at
 that
 and


say
 again
 what
 is
 where
 is
 innovation


come
 from
 right
 Innovation
 comes
 from
 us


being
 able
 to
 drive
 the
 solutions
 to


unmet
 unarticulated
 needs
 of
 customers


out
 there
 right
 so
 the
 key
 being
 unmet


and
 unarticulated
 so
 that
 means
 you
 have


to
 have
 a
 better
 sense
 when
 you're
 even


looking
 at
 some
 log
 data
 or
 you
 know


some
 customer
 interview
 data
 or
 whatever


you
 it's
 not
 just
 the
 words
 that
 they're


saying
 but
 you
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 walk
 in


their
 shoes
 uh
 and
 the
 good
 news
 there


is
 this
 is
 innate
 in
 us
 all
 human
 beings


we
 have
 uh
 the
 ability
 to
 empathize
 with


the
 other
 person
 um
 in
 fact
 design


thinking
 is
 that
 right
 so
 when
 people
 go


and
 say
 let's
 do
 learn
 about
 design


thinking
 design
 thinking
 is
 applied


empathy
 uh
 and
 so
 to
 me
 uh
 that's
 what
 I


pull
 the
 thread
 on
 which
 is
 let's
 not


think
 of
 empathy
 as
 something
 that
 you


know
 is
 just
 a
 soft
 skill
 that
 you


reserve
 for
 your
 friends
 and
 family
 but


it's
 I
 think
 it's
 at
 the
 root
 of
 all


Innovation
 uh
 it's
 about
 being
 able
 to


meet
 the
 unmet
 unarticulated
 needs
 that


comes
 from
 your
 unique
 I
 mean
 your


innate
 ability
 to
 have
 curiosity
 to


learn
 about
 others
 walk
 in
 their
 shoes


innovate
 on
 their
 behalf


uh
 and
 that
 I
 think
 is
 I
 think
 what
 we


have
 to
 do
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 I
 think


empathy
 is
 an
 important
 important
 skill


for
 all
 of
 us
 when
 did
 you
 first


discover
 the
 power
 of
 empathy
 I
 mean
 I
 I


read
 your
 book
 fantastic
 book
 you
 talk


very
 warmly
 about
 your
 mother
 she
 being


very


empathetic
 yeah
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think


that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 I
 feel


like
 all
 of
 us
 learn
 how
 to
 turn
 on
 this


bit
 of
 empathy
 through
 life's
 experience


right
 so
 in
 some
 sense
 every
 day
 you
 get


confronted
 with
 different
 circumstances


not
 just
 yourself
 personally
 but
 people


around
 you
 uh
 for
 me
 obviously
 the
 birth


of
 my
 son
 uh
 for
 both
 my
 wife
 and
 me
 was


uh
 was
 a
 life-changing
 event
 and
 was


something
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 over
 the


years
 I
 at
 least
 learned
 a
 lot
 because
 I


I
 I
 remember
 in
 the
 early
 days
 it
 was


all
 about
 sort
 of
 my
 son
 was
 born
 with


cbal
 poliy
 he
 passed
 away
 a
 few
 years


ago


uh
 and
 um
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 in
 the
 when


when
 he
 was
 born
 it
 was
 a
 lot
 about
 what


happened
 to
 me
 I
 was
 sort
 of
 you
 know


essentially
 quote
 unquote
 um
 you
 know
 in


you
 know
 all
 about
 why
 did
 this
 happen


to
 us
 why
 did
 it
 happen
 to
 me
 how
 and


then
 I
 realized
 after
 watching
 in
 some


sense
 my
 wife
 uh
 who
 was
 there
 as
 a


caregiver
 as
 a
 parent
 uh
 you
 know
 taking


him
 up
 and
 down
 Seattle
 to
 every
 therapy


possible
 uh
 quite
 frankly
 you
 know
 it


took
 me
 years
 not
 you
 know
 days
 or


months
 or
 weeks
 um
 and
 um
 and
 then
 I


realized
 that
 nothing
 had
 happened
 to
 me


but
 something
 had
 happened
 to
 my
 son
 and


I
 needed
 to
 be
 there
 for
 my
 son
 and
 that


is
 the
 experience
 I
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 but


there's
 experiences
 like
 that
 every
 day


right
 some
 colleague
 of
 mine
 comes
 with


some
 you
 know
 parent
 of
 theirs
 who
 needs


care
 right
 that
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 I
 learn


from
 it
 I
 or
 at
 least
 let
 me
 put
 it
 this


way
 I
 am
 more
 a
 tuned
 to
 learning
 from


other
 people's
 experiences
 today
 than
 I


was
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 my
 career
 and
 I


think
 that
 happens
 to
 all
 of
 us
 right


which
 is
 life's
 experiences
 if
 they
 they


ACW
 uh
 that
 ability
 to
 build
 a
 deeper


empathy
 for
 other
 people
 and
 that
 also


helps
 you
 be
 a
 better
 manager
 a
 better


coworker
 a
 better
 uh


innovator
 yeah
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 do
 you


um
 think
 there
 is
 a
 contradiction


between
 empathy
 and
 execution


I
 don't
 right
 I
 think
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 to
 me
 you
 have
 to
 take


accountability
 right
 so
 this
 is
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 uh
 in
 business
 um
 like


in
 life
 too
 right
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 be


accountable
 for
 making
 real
 progress
 uh


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 think
 about
 why
 do


businesses
 exist
 businesses
 exist
 at


least
 I
 like
 this
 Colin
 mayor
 definition


that
 you
 have
 to
 create
 profitable


solution
 to
 challenge
 of
 people
 in


Planet
 uh
 because
 that's
 at
 least
 a
 good


way
 to
 allocate
 the
 global
 resources


that
 are
 available
 right
 the
 profit


motive
 is
 a
 good
 motive
 because
 it
 means


you're
 competing
 and
 allocating


resources
 in
 the
 most
 efficient
 ways
 and


uh
 and
 face
 competition
 and
 so
 therefore


you
 have
 to
 have
 great
 execution
 you


have
 to
 have
 great


accountability
 and
 so
 I
 think
 of
 empathy


as
 a
 necessary
 condition
 to
 create
 great


solutions
 that
 are
 profitable
 and
 that


are
 competitive
 solutions
 that
 are


winning
 in
 the
 marketplace
 as
 opposed
 to


somehow
 this
 being
 a


tradeoff
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 your
 your


skill
 set
 and
 your
 personality
 what
 do


you
 think
 it
 is
 that
 makes
 you
 so


effective
 as
 a
 leader
 I
 mean
 first
 of


all
 right
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 of
 this


as
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 have
 causality
 here


well
 understood
 because
 quite
 frankly


it's
 so
 much
 easier
 for
 others
 to
 app


Pine
 on
 this
 than
 or
 rather
 it's
 it's


just
 really
 for
 others
 to
 judge
 and


assign
 uh
 causality
 there
 but
 the
 way
 at


least
 I
 come
 at
 this
 is
 I
 don't
 start


with
 uh
 what
 am
 I
 good
 at
 I
 am
 very


keenly
 shaped
 by
 what
 am
 I
 not
 good
 at


uh
 in
 other
 words
 I'm
 always
 looking


what
 can
 I
 learn
 from
 someone
 else
 so
 if


there's
 one
 attribute
 I
 have
 I
 don't


start
 each
 day
 by
 thinking
 oh
 all
 the


stuff
 I
 know
 and
 I'm
 good
 at
 I'm
 like


wow
 what
 am
 I
 weak
 at
 whom
 do
 I
 talk
 to


whom
 do
 I
 meet
 how
 do
 I
 really
 shape
 the


colleagues
 around
 me
 who
 have
 better


skills
 than
 me
 on
 many
 fronts
 uh
 that's


what
 I'm
 wired
 like
 maybe
 that
 helps
 but


I
 don't
 know
 whether
 that's
 the


causality
 but
 I
 don't
 start
 each
 day
 was


saying
 wow
 I'm
 so
 good
 at
 this
 so


therefore
 I'm
 GNA
 go
 do
 this
 no
 I
 come


at
 the
 exact
 opposite
 is
 it
 something


you
 learned
 from
 is
 this
 something
 you


learned
 from
 Bill
 Gates
 because
 he
 said


the
 same
 thing
 right
 he's
 a
 he's
 really


a
 Le
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 good


point
 both
 Bill
 and
 Steve
 uh
 there
 is
 uh


there's
 a
 sense
 at
 Microsoft
 I
 think


that
 that's
 an
 interesting
 thing
 we're


going
 to
 be
 50
 years
 next
 year
 um
 there


is
 you
 know
 what
 Andy
 Gro
 would
 talk
 the


paranoid
 survive
 or
 what
 have
 you
 um
 and


I
 don't
 come
 at
 it
 but
 though
 with


paranoia
 right
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 like


paranoia
 I
 like
 this
 just
 that's
 why
 I


go
 back
 to
 my
 own
 words
 for
 this
 is


that's
 why
 the
 the
 growth
 mindset
 or


confronting
 your
 own
 fixed
 mindset


having
 confidence
 that
 wow
 what
 an


unbelievable
 world
 we
 live
 in
 that
 every


customer
 can
 teach
 me
 every
 partner
 can


teach
 me
 every
 colleague
 can
 teach
 me


like
 what
 more
 can
 I
 ask
 for
 in
 life
 uh


so
 it's
 not
 paranoia
 it's
 not
 like
 oh


wow
 we
 have
 to
 go
 in
 every
 day
 uh
 that


if
 I
 don't
 learn
 something
 I'll
 you
 know


fail
 I'm
 more
 about
 like
 what
 do
 I
 learn


so
 that
 I
 can
 innovate
 maybe
 uh
 that's


how
 I
 come
 at
 it
 and
 that's
 right
 Bill


and
 Steve
 in
 their
 own
 unique
 way
 uh
 had


that
 mindset
 and
 so
 I've
 grown
 up
 around


it
 and
 how
 do
 you
 install
 that
 kind
 of
 I


mean
 it
 is
 humbleness
 in
 a
 way
 right
 how


do
 you
 install
 that
 in
 an
 organization


you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 you
 know


humbleness
 is
 an
 interesting
 word
 right


I
 I
 always
 say
 that
 you
 you
 need


confidence
 um
 and
 uh


humility
 uh
 and
 not
 hubris
 right
 because


there
 is
 sometimes
 confidence
 with


humility
 can
 allow
 you
 to
 really
 make


great
 progress
 but
 confidence
 that


translates
 into
 hubris
 and
 bring
 you


know
 it's
 the
 downfall
 of
 you
 know


civilizations
 Empires
 and
 IND
 indviduals


right
 and
 from
 ancient
 Greece
 to
 Modern


Silicon
 Valley
 and
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 think


uh
 you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 really
 get
 that


calibration
 that
 you
 got
 to
 have
 some


confidence
 in
 your
 own
 capability
 you


said
 in
 the
 podcast
 with
 um
 with
 our


common
 friend
 Adam
 grant
 that
 uh
 your


father
 he
 had
 a
 list
 of
 people
 he
 met


and
 a
 list
 of
 ideas
 generated
 have
 you


got
 a
 list
 of
 people
 you
 want
 to
 meet


yeah
 yeah
 so
 I
 he
 had
 this
 you
 know
 he


had
 this
 note
 in
 his
 diary
 were
 full
 of


that
 schema
 uh
 which
 is
 uh
 people
 met
 uh


ideas
 generated
 and
 tasks
 completed


which
 I
 love
 which
 is
 a
 beautiful
 way


each
 day
 to
 keep
 account
 of
 uh
 and


absolutely
 uh
 so
 that's
 sort
 of
 like
 I
 I


took
 that
 uh
 to
 heart
 and
 that's


essentially
 how
 that's
 my
 framework
 for


life
 as


well
 another
 thing
 that
 makes
 you
 stand


out
 is
 you
 know
 there
 is
 a
 saying
 most


people
 ignore
 most
 poetry
 because
 most


poetry
 ignores
 most
 people


that's
 clearly
 clearly
 not
 the
 case
 for


you
 tell
 me
 about
 your
 love
 for
 poetry
 I


love
 poetry
 you
 know
 F
 you
 know
 the


because
 in
 an
 interesting
 way
 I
 got
 into


poetry
 very
 late
 uh
 my
 mom
 was
 a
 a


professor
 of
 Sanskrit
 drama
 and
 um
 and


um
 and
 so
 she
 really
 instilled
 in
 me
 or


at
 least
 tried
 to
 instill
 in
 me
 the
 love


for
 um
 you
 know
 poetry
 and
 in
 her
 case


you
 know
 Sanskrit
 uh
 literature
 and


poetry
 and
 what
 have
 you
 but
 I
 think
 of


it
 as
 compression
 it's
 the
 best
 like


when
 you
 think
 about
 code
 uh
 is
 as
 I


coded
 more
 is
 when
 I
 sort
 of
 sort
 of


felt
 like
 wow
 poetry
 is


basically
 natural
 language


compression
 um
 and
 it
 is
 able
 to


describe
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 model
 of


the
 world
 in
 the
 most
 uh
 succinct
 form


and
 so
 there's
 um
 and
 I
 I
 got
 into
 uru


poetry
 in
 a
 big
 way
 in
 my
 mid-30s
 and
 so


I
 grew
 up
 in
 Hyderabad
 where
 obviously


Udu
 poetry
 was
 in
 the
 air
 um
 and
 now
 of


course
 I
 love
 it
 but
 even
 you
 know
 the


American
 poets
 uh
 the
 English
 Romantics


Germans
 they're
 F
 I
 mean
 like
 so
 I
 I'm


at
 least
 I'm
 not
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 I
 know


much
 poetry
 uh
 but
 I
 at
 least
 I'm


fascinated
 by
 the
 ability
 of
 the
 human


mind
 to
 compress
 uh
 thought
 whether
 it's


code
 or
 poetry
 well
 that's
 fantastic


last
 question
 um
 SAA
 we
 have
 um
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 young
 people
 listening
 to


this
 what
 is
 your
 best
 advice
 to
 young


people
 I'd
 say
 the
 best
 you
 know
 advice


for
 anyone
 starting
 out
 in
 I
 oh
 you
 know


some
 sort
 of
 advice
 I
 got
 uh
 which
 I


paraphrase
 as
 never
 wait
 for
 your
 next


job
 to
 do
 your
 best
 work
 right
 which
 is


one
 of
 the
 things
 is
 any
 job
 you
 get


like
 I
 don't
 remember
 ever
 at
 Microsoft


feeling
 like
 oh
 I
 have
 to
 get
 a


promotion
 in
 order
 to
 feel
 more


satisfied
 or
 more
 fulfilled
 because
 I


Som
 felt
 I
 had
 gotten
 the
 lottery
 and
 I


was
 in
 the
 best
 job
 I
 could
 ever
 be
 in


and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 you
 shouldn't
 have


ambition
 you
 shouldn't
 strive
 for
 your


next
 promotion
 you
 shouldn't
 put


advocate
 for
 yourself
 or
 have
 others
 you


absolutely
 should
 do
 all
 that
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 really
 my
 advice
 would
 be
 also


to
 take
 the
 job
 you
 have
 at
 hand
 and
 do


an
 un
 wonderful
 you
 know
 go
 at
 it
 with


uh
 all
 of
 you
 the
 wiger
 and
 all
 of
 the


energy
 and
 also
 Define
 it
 as
 broadly
 as


possible
 right
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 perhaps


one
 of
 the
 things
 when
 I
 look
 back
 at
 it


I
 never
 defined
 my
 job
 narrowly
 uh
 and


that
 I
 think
 was
 both
 very
 satisfying
 in


the
 moment
 and
 it
 helped
 I
 think
 land
 me


the
 next
 job
 and
 so
 that
 that
 that
 is
 my


perhaps
 the
 ad
 one
 advice
 I
 would
 leave


people
 with
 well
 I
 cannot
 think
 of


anybody
 who
 is
 doing
 a
 better
 job
 than


you
 so
 uh
 big
 thanks
 for
 being
 in
 the


show
 good
 luck
 with
 everything
 and
 uh


you
 know
 all
 the
 best
 thank
 you
 so
 much


n
 such
