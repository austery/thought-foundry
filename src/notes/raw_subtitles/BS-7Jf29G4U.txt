From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Tuesday,
 October
 14th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


So,
 this
 long
 and
 difficult
 war
 has
 now


ended.
 You
 know,
 some
 people
 say
 3,000


years,
 some
 people
 say
 500
 years.


Whatever
 it
 is,
 it's
 uh
 the
 granddaddy


of
 them
 all.
 You
 succeeded
 in
 doing


something
 that
 no
 one
 believed
 was


possible.
 You
 brought
 most
 of
 the
 world


behind
 your
 proposal
 to
 free
 the


hostages
 and
 end
 the
 war.


>> You
 could
 hear
 in
 in
 the
 speeches
 by


President
 Trump
 and
 Prime
 Minister


Netanyahu
 in
 Jerusalem
 this
 kind
 of


reaching
 to
 declare
 victory.


>> This
 is
 the
 historic
 dawn
 of
 a
 new


Middle
 East.


>> Trump
 and
 declaring
 that
 the
 war
 is


over.
 Netanyahu
 claiming
 a
 victory
 for


Israel
 over
 Hamas.


>> With
 our
 military
 pressure


and
 President
 Trump's
 global
 leadership,


we
 achieved
 this
 historic
 moment.


>> But,
 you
 know,
 there
 is
 no
 guarantee


that
 this
 war
 is
 fully
 over.
 As
 much
 as


it
 took
 months
 of
 negotiations,
 getting


to
 this
 point
 may
 well
 prove
 to
 have


been
 the
 easy
 part.
 And
 going
 from
 here


forward
 to
 complete
 the
 rest
 of
 Donald


Trump's
 peace
 plan
 might
 actually
 prove


a
 lot
 harder.
 David
 Helfinger
 is
 the


Times
 bureau
 chief
 in
 Jerusalem.
 He
 says


that
 after
 yesterday's
 long
 awaited


return
 of
 the
 last
 hostages
 and
 the


release
 of
 nearly
 2,000
 Palestinian


prisoners,
 there's
 been
 a
 huge
 sense
 of


relief
 and
 tears
 of
 joy
 across
 the


region
 at
 the
 break
 in
 fighting.
 But


hanging
 over
 all
 of
 that
 are
 a
 lot
 of


unresolved
 questions
 about
 what
 happens


next.
 To
 go
 from
 a
 ceasefire
 to
 actual


peace
 here,
 both
 sides
 have
 to
 give
 up


things
 that
 they're
 really
 not
 ready
 to


do.
 Hamas
 is
 being
 asked
 to
 lay
 down
 its


weapons
 permanently.
 This
 for
 Hamas,


which
 is
 created
 as
 a
 resistance


organization,
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 giving


up
 its
 ideology
 or
 ceasing
 to
 exist.
 For


Israel,
 the
 request
 is
 to
 pull
 out


completely
 from
 the
 Gaza
 Strip.
 And


they're
 being
 asked
 to
 do
 that
 by
 Hamas


before
 Gaza
 is
 fully
 disarmed.
 And
 the


idea
 that
 Israel
 would
 pull
 out


completely
 knowing
 that
 Hamas
 still
 has


weapons
 and
 fighters
 and
 tunnels
 is


just,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to


imagine
 them
 ever
 accepting
 that.
 And


then
 there
 are
 other
 aspects
 of
 the
 way


forward
 that
 are
 also
 equally
 thorny.


The
 plan
 calls
 for
 an
 international


stabilization
 force
 made
 up
 of
 soldiers


from
 other
 countries,
 funded
 by
 other


countries,
 while
 Arab
 countries
 are


expected
 to
 step
 up.
 It
 is
 hard
 to


imagine
 Arab
 countries
 sending
 their


soldiers
 into
 Gaza
 to
 effectively
 assist


the
 Israelis
 lest
 they
 be
 considered
 an


occupying
 army
 themselves.
 So
 there's


just
 every
 aspect
 of
 the
 way
 forward
 is


fraught
 with
 peril
 and
 pitfalls.


In
 Gaza
 with
 the
 ceasefire
 in
 place,
 the


United
 Nations
 says
 it's
 making
 quote


real
 progress
 in
 getting
 more
 aid
 in
 to


help
 ease
 the
 humanitarian
 crisis
 there.


It
 said
 it's
 now
 been
 able
 to
 bring
 in


cooking
 oil
 for
 the
 first
 time
 since


March
 along
 with
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 hot
 meals,
 tents
 for
 displaced


families,
 and
 medical
 supplies.
 The
 UN


estimates
 that
 at
 least
 500,000
 gazins


will
 need
 treatment
 to
 address
 the


effects
 of
 famine.

Now,
 three
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 Just
 after
 midnight,
 a


new
 wave
 of
 tariffs
 kicked
 in
 that
 could


affect
 the
 American
 housing
 market.


There's
 now
 an
 additional
 10%
 levy
 on


imported
 wood
 and
 timber
 and
 25%
 sir


charges
 on
 upholstered
 furniture,


kitchen
 cabinets,
 and
 bathroom
 vanities.


The
 Trump
 administration
 says
 the


tariffs
 will
 encourage
 more
 furniture


manufacturing
 and
 logging
 in
 the
 US.
 But


some
 economists
 say
 that
 for
 the
 moment,


higher
 lumber
 prices
 could
 slow
 the
 pace


of
 home
 building
 and
 drive
 up
 the
 cost


of
 housing.
 Home
 prices
 have
 already
 hit


record
 highs
 this
 year.
 Also,
 the


administration
 has
 given
 journalists


reporting
 on
 the
 Pentagon
 a
 deadline
 of


5:00
 p.m.
 today
 to
 either
 agree
 to
 new


restrictions
 on
 their
 coverage
 or


forfeit
 their
 press
 passes.
 The
 21
 pages


of
 new
 rules
 put
 out
 by
 the
 Pentagon


reflect
 Defense
 Secretary
 Pete
 Hgs's


adversarial
 approach
 to
 the
 press
 corps.


They
 include
 a
 number
 of
 requirements


that
 lawyers
 for
 news
 outlets
 say


restrict
 press
 freedom.
 For
 example,
 one


provision
 says
 that
 journalists
 could
 be


deemed
 a
 quote
 security
 risk
 if
 they


disclose
 classified
 or
 even
 unclassified


information
 without
 Pentagon
 approval.


The
 conservative
 news
 outlet
 ONN
 has


signed
 on
 to
 the
 policy,
 but
 many
 others


have
 already
 said
 they'll
 refuse,


including
 CNN,
 NPR,
 Newsmax,
 the


Washington
 Post,
 the
 Times,
 and
 The


Atlantic.
 The
 editor
 of
 The
 Atlantic


said,
 quote,
 "The
 requirements
 violate


our
 First
 Amendment
 rights
 and
 the


rights
 of
 Americans
 who
 seek
 to
 know
 how


taxpayer
 funded
 military
 resources
 and


personnel
 are
 being
 deployed."


And


>> today
 in
 front
 of
 the
 Labor
 Department


in
 Washington,
 there's
 a
 group
 of
 people


who
 are
 going
 to
 be
 protesting
 the


administration.
 And
 it
 might
 be


surprising
 to
 some
 to
 see
 who
 the


protesters
 are.
 Coal
 miners.
 Lisa


Freriedman
 covers
 energy
 policy
 for
 the


Times.


>> Just
 a
 few
 months
 ago,
 coal
 miners
 were


standing
 behind
 President
 Trump
 at
 a


press
 conference.


>> I
 call
 it
 beautiful
 clean
 coal.
 I
 told


my
 people,
 never
 use
 the
 word
 coal


unless
 you
 put
 beautiful
 clean
 before


it.
 while
 he
 announced
 the
 ways
 that
 he


planned
 to
 reinvigorate
 their
 struggling


industry.


>> Beautiful.


>> Now
 though,
 they're
 protesting
 the


monthslong
 delay
 of
 a
 regulation
 that
 is


aimed
 at
 protecting
 miners
 against
 a


major
 driver
 of
 black
 lung
 disease.
 Lisa


says
 that
 the
 coal
 miners
 who
 are


protesting
 today
 are
 worried
 about


exposure
 to
 toxic
 silica
 dust,
 which
 has


driven
 a
 recent
 spike
 in
 the
 incurable


respiratory
 disease
 known
 as
 black
 lung.


When
 miners
 cut
 into
 rock,
 silica
 dust


gets
 released
 into
 the
 air.
 And
 because


miners
 in
 places
 like
 Appalachia
 have


already
 pulled
 out
 the
 most
 easily


accessible
 coal,
 they've
 been
 having
 to


cut
 deeper
 and
 deeper
 into
 the
 rock,


exposing
 themselves
 to
 even
 more
 silica


than
 previous
 generations.
 New
 limits
 on


silica
 exposure
 from
 the
 Biden


administration
 were
 supposed
 to
 take


effect
 in
 April.
 But
 after
 a
 lawsuit


from
 mining
 industry
 groups,
 the
 Trump


administration
 agreed
 to
 delay


enforcement.


>> I
 spoke
 with
 a
 number
 of
 miners
 and


their
 family
 members
 who
 will
 be
 in


Washington
 today.
 And
 many
 of
 them


pointed
 out
 to
 me
 the
 enormous


assistance
 that
 the
 administration
 has


given
 to
 coal
 mining
 companies
 to
 coal


fired
 power
 plants
 and
 they
 feel
 that


they
 are
 not
 getting
 the
 same
 attention


to
 their
 health.
 I
 spoke
 with
 Judith


Reef.
 Her
 husband
 was
 a
 coal
 miner
 in


West
 Virginia
 who
 passed
 away
 from
 black


lung
 and
 she
 told
 me
 the
 coal
 miners


have
 supplied
 this
 country
 with


electricity
 and
 now
 they're
 just
 cast


aside
 to
 die.


In
 a
 statement,
 a
 White
 House


spokeswoman
 said
 President
 Trump
 quote


cares
 deeply
 about
 unleashing
 America's


energy
 potential
 as
 well
 as
 standing
 up


for
 those
 who
 fuel
 our
 country.
 She
 did


not
 say
 what
 the
 administration
 plans
 to


do
 about
 the
 silica
 dust
 regulation.


[Music]


In
 California,
 homeowners
 who've
 lost


everything
 in
 devastating
 wildfires
 say


they've
 often
 had
 to
 live
 through
 a


second
 trauma,
 dealing
 with
 insurance


paperwork,
 in
 order
 to
 get
 payouts
 for


what
 they've
 lost.
 Most
 fire
 victims


have
 had
 to
 submit
 exhaustive


inventories,
 sometimes
 thousands
 of


items
 long,
 covering
 everything
 from
 TVs


to
 toothbrushes.
 After
 detailing
 every


single
 thing,
 then
 insurers
 would
 decide


what
 the
 payout
 would
 be.
 But
 a
 new
 law


signed
 by
 Governor
 Gavin
 Newsome
 aims
 to


ease
 that
 burden.
 Under
 the
 legislation,


Californians
 will
 be
 able
 to
 collect
 at


least
 60%
 of
 their
 coverage
 amount


without
 cataloging
 every
 item
 burned
 in


the
 blaze.
 That's
 up
 from
 a
 30%
 payout


before.
 There's
 a
 cap
 of
 $350,000.


Lawmakers
 celebrated
 the
 bill's
 passage


as
 a
 win
 for
 wildfire
 victims.
 They'll


no
 longer
 have
 to
 sift
 through
 the
 ashes


or
 dig
 through
 old
 receipts
 and
 photos


to
 find
 ownership
 of
 every
 little
 thing.


The
 relief
 won't
 be
 instant,
 though.
 The


new
 law
 takes
 effect
 next
 year
 and
 is


not
 retroactive,
 meaning
 people
 who
 lost


homes,
 like
 in
 LA's
 widespread
 wildfires


this
 year,
 are
 not
 necessarily
 eligible.


Lawmakers,
 however,
 are
 urging
 insurance


companies
 to
 voluntarily
 adopt
 the


practice
 now.


[Music]


And
 finally,


>> I
 think
 I
 got
 like
 15
 things,
 maybe
 16,


I
 don't
 really
 know.
 And
 it
 was
 like


$96.
 Starting
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 the
 fast


fashion
 company
 Shien
 basically
 took


over
 the
 internet,
 filling
 social
 media


feeds
 with
 cheap
 knockoffs
 and


influencers
 showing
 off
 their
 shopping


halls.


>> It's
 just
 this
 like
 lace.


>> Now
 though,
 the
 company's
 trying
 to
 make


the
 leap
 from
 online
 shopping
 to
 an


actual
 physical
 store,
 but


it
 has
 been
 a
 little
 rocky.


Sheen
 picked
 Paris,
 the
 world
 capital
 of


fashion,
 as
 the
 site
 for
 its
 first
 ever


brickandmortar
 boutique.
 It
 plans
 to


open
 in
 an
 iconic
 department
 store
 with


sweeping
 views
 of
 the
 Eiffel
 Tower.
 The


store
 BHV
 Marray
 is
 known
 for
 selling


French
 specialty
 brands.
 Sheen's
 space


there
 is
 supposed
 to
 open
 next
 month,


but
 French
 lawmakers
 and
 the
 fashion


world
 have
 responded
 with
 a
 very
 cold


shoulder.
 BHV
 Marray's
 staff
 walked
 off


the
 job
 last
 week
 to
 protest
 Shien's


arrival,
 accusing
 the
 company
 of
 using


cheap
 labor
 and
 violating
 environmental


and
 human
 rights
 standards
 at
 its


factories,
 claims
 Shien
 has
 denied.
 As


the
 home
 of
 Chanel,
 Dior,
 and
 other
 high


fashion
 empires,
 France,
 as
 a
 country,


is
 already
 fighting
 back
 against
 fast


fashion.
 The
 French
 Senate
 recently


passed
 a
 so-called
 anti-Shi
 measure
 that


would
 raise
 taxes
 on
 cheap
 Chinese


clothing.
 If
 signed
 into
 law,
 the
 bill


would
 also
 ban
 the
 company's
 ads
 in


France
 and
 penalize
 influencers
 who


promote
 the
 products.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy


Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
