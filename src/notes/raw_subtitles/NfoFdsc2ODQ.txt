- There is no other technological
shift that has an ability
to reimagine every single function
within the pharmaceutical industry.
And we believe that this is truly
a once in a generation opportunity
for us to accelerate our progress
and our impact for patients.
- Hi everyone. I'm Ivy Weng.
I'm on the Healthcare & Life Sciences
Go-to-Market team here at Anthropic.
- Hi everyone.
My name is Sarah Nam, and
I'm the Vice President
of AI Strategy and Partnerships at AbbVie.
- Thank you so much for joining us, Sarah.
Maybe you could start
by telling us a little bit about your role
at AbbVie and the remit.
- Yes, I'm currently serving
in developing a new function
called AI Strategy and Partnerships,
and the remit of my
team is really twofold.
The first is to lead our
enterprise AI strategy
in terms of defining
what are our strategic priorities
related to AI across our business,
as well as many of the
cross-cutting enablers
that allow us to make that
happen from the tech architecture
to the data modernization to
change management among others.
The second hat that I play
is around our business development
and external innovation at AbbVie.
We wanted to stand up an entirely new team
that would focus on business
development related to AI.
And so that's a little bit about the role
that I play at AbbVie.
- We see AbbVie as a
leader in deploying AI
in life sciences,
and it would be great if you
could paint a picture around
how AI has been deployed
across the biopharma lifecycle.
- There is no other technological
shift that has an ability
to reimagine every single function
within the pharmaceutical industry.
And we believe that this is truly
a once in a generation opportunity
for us to accelerate our progress
and our impact for patients.
And we're taking a very
value chain-based approach
to how we do this at AbbVie
and really being able to identify
what are the core priorities
for AI across each function within AbbVie
and being able to deploy
AI use cases against them.
And so I'll walk you through
some of the core functions
and where we're prioritizing AI.
Within drug discovery,
we're deeply inspired
by the ways in which we can
better understand human biology
and be able to design, make, test,
and validate new therapies at
scale much more effectively
through AI.
We're also focused a
lot on multiparametric
optimization of human efficacy, safety,
and pharmacokinetics when
it comes to designing drugs,
both in the small molecule
and biologic space a lot more effectively.
And in addition, we're
spending a lot of time around
how we do indication expansion
in combination studies
by really pulling together
clinical data, genomic data,
and multimodal data of all kinds,
to be able to drive that
more effectively at scale.
And lastly, we're also
spending a lot of time
around precision medicine,
starting first with digital pathology,
but really expanding upon
the ways in which we could
deliver medicines in a
much more precise way
for our patients.
In addition, as we think
about clinical development,
there is so much that we
could do as it relates to
how we design
and conduct clinical trials.
On the design of clinical trials,
we're spending time around
how we can leverage AI
to better inform our inclusion
exclusion criteria for trials
to how we think about adaptive
clinical trial designs
and really being able to
identify patient subpopulations
that are more likely
to respond to our drugs
for heterogeneous diseases.
And then as we think about
running the clinical trials,
there's also so much that
we could do in terms of
being able to automate
a lot of the processes
related to clinical trials,
as well as authoring documents
that are related to document submission,
regulatory requirements
among others in that space.
And then lastly, there's also
a lot that we're doing around
data surveillance within the
clinical development space,
and that we could really
be able to leverage AI
to look at the types of
clinical data that's coming in
for our different programs
and be able to adjust accordingly.
- I mean, what you're describing
is exactly the inflection
point that we are experiencing
where we're moving from
acceleration to AI transformation.
And it sounds like you're describing this
across clinical workflows,
commercial workflows,
regulatory workflows.
Are you able to dive into
maybe one or two examples
and walk us through that?
- A few areas that we've
worked together on include,
one is around GenAIsys,
and GenAIsys is a tool
that we've developed
that leverages generative
AI to really pull forward
a lot of the different
sales force-related tools
that are helping our sales
force be much more effective
in their call planning.
And so this has been a tremendous effort
that has allowed our
sales reps across AbbVie
to be much more effective and
efficient in what they do.
And early results are showing
that there's been very
significant improvements
in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness of our sales force
that are enabled by a tool like GenAIsys.
In addition, we've partnered on GAIA,
which is a clinical development
document authoring tool
whereby we're leveraging
large language models
to essentially automate the writing
and authoring of a lot
of our study documents,
starting first with
NDA and PSUR documents,
but really to thousands of
different document types.
And this has led to roughly 40
to 60% efficiencies in terms
of time saving and writing
some of these documents across AbbVie.
- I think part of what makes Anthropic
and the models that we're
building so exciting
is that we see this as the engine
powering all of these different use cases
that are applicable to
life sciences firms.
Something that we think
about a lot is, you know,
we see coding being adopted
and has proliferated, really.
And you know, we think
that value from coding
can be transferred or you know,
can be experienced in
other industries, too.
But I think fundamentally there are some
very pragmatic issues or
problems when we're working
with larger enterprises
when there's a lot of
change management involved.
How do you see that playing out at AbbVie?
- It's not only a technology challenge,
but it's also really moving
people's hearts and minds
and also the process
management that's needed.
And so we have found
that focusing on people
and processes are equally as important
as many of the technology decisions
and truly driving an AI transformation
at a large enterprise.
Some of the ways that we've been focusing
on change management in
AbbVie include upskilling
in terms of doing AI training programs
at all levels across the organization
from those that are just
starting on their journey
to learn AI
all the way to the more
proficient practitioners
that are developing the
AI solutions on behalf
of many of our functions.
And in addition, we're focused
on demonstrating early wins
that by being able to
focus on a few use cases
that generate near-term
ROI, financial returns,
impact for our patients
that really move the needle
on true golden metrics
in our business,
in each of our functions
has been really critical
to that change management.
And then lastly, it's been really
empowering champions within
each of our functions
that we are standing up small AI teams
across each of the functions
that serve as true champions
that bring forward a lot
of the AI transformation
in their respective domains.
- When your teams are evaluating
or looking at new AI technology partners,
what are some of the
criteria that you use?
- Our organization recently developed a
detailed diligence framework
for how we would evaluate
AI-driven partnerships,
and there's four key
pillars that we focus on.
One is really around the strategic fit.
How does the actual partnership fit
in terms of the strategic objectives
of the organization that we have?
The second is really around
the technical foundation
in terms of how differentiated
is the AI offering
that the partner is providing?
What is the actual data
generation capabilities,
what's the comparative differentiation
in the models that they're providing?
And really being able to diligence that
in a very systematic way.
The third pillar that we look at is really
around the management team.
And so typically,
especially with AI-driven
drug discovery partnerships,
we're looking at ones that
truly understand our domain
as well as the deep AI
and ML experience that we're looking for.
And having that kind of bilingualism
in terms of the management
team is really critical for us.
And then the last pillar that we look at
is really around external validation.
And so looking towards
benchmarking real impact
in terms of case studies has
been really critical for us,
primarily around how we evaluate
AI-driven drug discovery partners.
- I love that framework.
If you were to speak
with another pharma exec,
what would you tell them about, you know,
going on their own AI
transformation journey?
Any advice you have for them?
- I think my advice
would be to start simple,
start to identify a few areas
that could serve as quick wins
and early demonstrations of impact.
And once those are
demonstrated in the ROI,
in some ways can then self-fund
the rest of the AI initiatives,
but those early wins will really enable
tremendous amount of transformation
across the organization.
- That really resonates with us.
I think something that
we think about a lot is
the risk of inaction is just too great,
and that's not something that
I think a lot of companies
are willing to take.
Given all the innovation in this space,
what are you most excited about
in the next three to five
years around AI and pharma?
- I'm very excited about
the ways in which AI
will push the frontiers of drug discovery
in a meaningful way.
A few areas that I'm very
excited about is one,
that generative models can
push the frontiers in terms
of not only being able to
predict molecular properties,
but also aid in de novo
design of small molecules
and biologics in a really meaningful way.
The second area that
I'm very excited about
is around being able to
develop agentic models
that can help us glean
and actively reason against
multimodal data sets
from genomics to proteomics,
to transcriptomics,
to clinical, to real-world
data in a meaningful way,
and really be able to
integrate those insights
to address biological problems
that we're working on.
And the third is around
patient stratification,
that this could really help
us not only in the discovery
of therapeutics,
but also in how we design
our clinical trials
going forward as well.
Thank you so much for joining us today.
It's been wonderful having you.
- Thank you so much, Ivy.
