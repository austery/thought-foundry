Most people don't know
the real story of Alfred Nobel.
(dramatic music)
One morning in 1888,
Alfred Nobel sat down
to read the newspaper
in his conservatory.
He scanned the pages casually,
but then, he froze.
The Merchant of Death is dead.
Dr. Alfred Nobel, who
became rich by finding ways
to kill more people faster than
ever before, died yesterday.
It was his own obituary.
The newspaper had made a mistake.
Alfred's older brother
Ludwig had died in France,
and the journalists had confused the two.
(dramatic music)
But in that moment, he saw exactly
how the world would remember
him, not as an inventor,
but as a butcher.
Now, the wording in the
obituary, the Merchant of Death
and all that, well, it's
likely been exaggerated
over the years.
We could only find an obituary
that described him as a man
who can hardly be passed off
as a benefactor of humanity.
But reading this allowed Alfred to see
what others truly thought
of him, and it wasn't good.
He had earned his reputation
building an empire
on one substance.
Nitroglycerin.
It's one of the most powerful
explosives in the world.
Its blast pressure is over 100
times greater than gunpowder.
(explosion booms)
- Oh my God.
Woo!
Oh, that's so sick.
But that power comes at a price.
Nitroglycerin is so sensitive
that if it's dropped, shaken,
or even just bumped, it can detonate.
And as a result, hundreds
of workers died trying to handle it.
So Alfred made it his
mission to tame this beast.
But in doing so, he created
powerful new explosives used
in everything from blasting
tunnels to making bombs,
tools that transformed the modern world,
but also contributed to
deaths of tens of thousands
of people, unleashing
a level of destruction
that would come to define him.
(ground rumbles)
Alfred's father, Immanuel
was also an inventor.
He opened the first ever
rubber factory in Sweden
and invented the rotary lathe,
which made modern plywood possible.
But Immanuel struggled with business.
He went bankrupt shortly
after Alfred was born.
So Immanuel set off to
Russia to start over,
leaving his family behind.
Some of Alfred's earliest memories
were of watching his brothers sell matches
on the street corners of
Stockholm just to afford food.
He was often sick, bedridden
with colds, stomach problems,
and bouts of depression.
He would later say, "Mine
was a pitiful half-life,
which ought to have been extinguished
by some compassionate doctor
as I yelled my way into the world."
But soon after Alfred turned nine,
a letter arrived from his
father asking the family
to join him in St. Petersburg.
In the early 1850s, the great powers
of Europe were gearing up for war.
And Immanuel spotted an opportunity.
He realized Russia's
capital was vulnerable
to attack from the sea.
So he approached Tsar
Nicholas I with plans
for a new kind of explosive device,
one that would float in the harbor
and detonate on contact with enemy ships.
A sea mine.
(explosion booms)
Within months of his
proposal in the Black Sea
just off Sinope, the Russian
Navy sank an ottoman fleet,
and the Crimean war began.
Immanuel's invention was
suddenly in high demand,
and the newly established
Nobel armaments factory
quickly grew from a few dozen employees
to over 1,000, producing mines, torpedoes
and other explosives for
the Russian military.
With money now pouring
in, Immanuel decided
to invest in Alfred's education.
At the age of 17,
Alfred found himself in a lab in Paris
studying under the
world's greatest chemists.
And it's here that he
met an Italian doctor
named Ascanio Sobrero who
had a peculiar demonstration.
Sobrero would take an ordinary
looking piece of cotton
and lay it on an anvil.
He would raise his hammer and.
(mysterious music)
- Whoa. (laughs)
It's like a bird ran into a window.
- That was a good one, right?
- Yeah, that was a great one.
- Soaked into that cotton
was a new explosive
material, nitroglycerin,
and it was unlike anything the world
had ever seen before.
See, until then, the most
commonly used explosive
was gunpowder.
But it had a major drawback.
It's fast, but it's not that fast.
When we were doing it, it was much slower
than the speed of sound.
- Ah!
- Jesus!
- That's because all the
ingredients you need,
the carbon for fuel, the
potassium nitrate for oxygen
and the sulfur to speed up the reaction,
they are all in separate grains.
And if they're spread far apart,
their reaction is just too slow.
Come on, you can do it.
Go.
But if you contain gunpowder,
that forces these
reactants closer together.
And it also traps in heat,
which accelerates the reaction.
And this allows the
pressure from the hot gases
to build up until.
(explosion booms)
(playful music)
- You see the explosion
and then the powder burst out.
- No way.
- And then it catches flames.
- Yeah.
- You can see
the whole bottom comes out,
and then it just catches up to it.
All these particles have
to be in close proximity,
and they also have to be small enough,
and they have to be mixed well enough
to get this reaction.
So it kinda feels a little bit clunky.
Like it's not the ideal
way you'd wanna do this,
where it's like all the molecules
are actually like right
next to each other.
- That's a great instinct.
Putting all the molecules
beside each other
so that you'd have them all available
to react as quickly as possible.
But I think I can one up that.
And that is, can you
put everything you need
in the same molecule?
- Okay.
- And that's what nitroglycerin does.
- No way.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, right?
Pretty cool.
- That is way cooler.
And because of that,
it's way more powerful.
We've loaded 15 grams of gunpowder
and 15 grams of nitroglycerin
into test tubes,
and then set them in clay blocks
so we can compare their destructive power.
- This is a bikini gauge for
measuring blast over pressure.
And it's called the
bikini gauge in reference
to the bikini atoll
because a analog blast over
pressure measurement device
was used in the nuclear
tests in the bikini atoll.
It has a number of
different diameter holes
and a film inside.
- [Narrator] The larger
circles have more area,
and so under the same pressure,
they will experience more
force and so burst first.
The smaller circles take
more pressure to break
because they've got smaller area.
- The smaller the circle
that gets punctured
means the higher the blast over pressure.
- Okay, black powder into clay.
- Fire in the hole!
Three, two, one.
(explosion booms)
Yeah, it launched the block a bit.
Popped the top right off.
- Let's look at the bikini gauge,
which looks totally intact.
- Looks totally intact.
- Yeah.
I mean, I'm getting nothing, yeah.
- All right.
- So, we'll see if we'll
leave that for the nitro.
When the nitroglycerin goes off,
it's gonna be like someone
shooting a 50 cal.
So I don't know if
you've been to the range,
but that's gonna be a big blast.
(mysterious music)
Fire in the hole!
Five, four, three, two, one.
- Oh.
Oh my God.
(explosion booms)
So first thing I noticed
is there are bits of clay
that have just rained down on me.
I got bits of blue all over me.
That's crazy, right there.
Is there anything left?
- Yeah, there is a
bunch of clay on this window,
on that window, on this
window, on bikini gauge.
- It's like a Jackson Pollock painting.
(mysterious music)
There's no way we've got a frame there.
There's just instant white.
Joosh
When it's fast on the
phantom,
then it's fast.
- (laughs) Right.
- Nitroglycerin is incredibly powerful
and it gets this power from
its molecular structure.
See, nitroglycerin is a
highly unstable molecule.
It consists of a chain
of three carbon atoms
with three oxygens,
and then three nitro
groups attached to those,
which are just nitrogen atoms
bonded to two oxygen atoms.
These nitro groups are what
makes nitroglycerin so unstable.
Oxygen is more
electronegative than nitrogen.
So these two oxygen atoms
pull on the electrons
from the nitrogen, which shifts
the electron density away
from this third oxygen.
But now there's little
shared electron density
between these two atoms, which
results in a much weaker bond
between the nitro groups
and the main chain.
So you get these weak spots,
and all it takes is a
little bit of energy,
like from the shock
created by hammer strike
and then those bonds snap apart.
So now you've got all these atoms
that are swapping partners,
and they form much more stable
products like nitrogen gas,
carbon dioxide, and water vapor.
And this process releases a
huge amount of energy and heat,
and it shoots off the
products at high velocities.
So then these go on to hit
other nitroglycerin molecules,
which causes their bonds to break.
And if this happens for
enough molecules at once,
well, it sets off a chain reaction.
- Now you've got a shockwave,
and now it's going to propagate.
And as it propagates through,
it's gonna break bonds
here, here, here, here, here.
- [Henry] Its blast pressure
is over 100 times greater than
the peak pressures that
are produced by gunpowder.
- Lots of things will explode
even, you know, you pop a
balloon and that's an explosion.
But the specific kind of
explosion we're interested in
with nitroglycerin is a detonation.
And the detonation is that
chemical decomposition
that happens faster than the
speed of sound in the material.
- What we see in our experiments
with nitroglycerin is all these
things happen really fast.
Like less than 100 femtoseconds fast.
- I don't operate in femtosecond
seconds very frequently.
How fast is that?
- Well, femtosecond 10
to negative 15 seconds.
- That's crazy.
So a molecule of
nitroglycerin will decompose
3 trillion times faster
than the blink of an eye.
And it's this speed that is one
of the defining characteristics
of high explosives.
- Yet, Sobrero never set out
to discover an explosive.
He was searching for a
medicine to improve blood flow.
During one test, he mixed
glycerol with nitric
and sulfuric acid, when
suddenly, it exploded.
(explosion booms)
Sobrero survived but shards of glass
left permanent scars on his face.
Deeply shaken, he concluded
this new substance,
nitroglycerin, was just too dangerous.
He later wrote, "I am
almost ashamed to admit
to be its discoverer."
But Alfred disagreed.
To him, the hammer strike
was like a pistol shot.
It was like somebody had kicked
open the door to his mind.
- It's a real shift in his character.
'cause he is been this frail, sickly boy,
kind of has trouble with people.
And then he discovers
explosives and chemistry
and it changes.
You know, it's like
whenever he is working,
he finally isn't depressed.
You know, he can kind of
escape through his work.
- And you know, at that age,
you're probably not thinking
about all the possible
consequences of this.
You're just sort of excited
about what it can do.
Far from fearing its power,
he believed he'd be the one to unlock it
and solve one of nitroglycerin's
greatest problems.
- If I had a jar sitting
right here and I wanted to
detonate it, how do I do that?
- Need a long fuse.
- But what's crazy about nitroglycerin
is that a regular flame
won't cause it to ignite.
So even if I ran a fuse into that vial,
it's not gonna explode.
See, while a fuse can heat nitroglycerin,
which makes its molecules vibrate faster,
and it might even break a few no bonds,
it usually doesn't break
enough of them at the same time
to detonate the rest of the liquid.
So it doesn't explode.
However, if you drop it.
(explosion booms)
But even that effect isn't consistent.
We tried putting a vial loose
in the back of this RC truck,
expecting the bumpy ride to trigger it.
(playful music)
And nothing.
- Whoa!
- Ah!
- It always seems to be blowing up
when you don't want it to,
and you can't really get it to
blow up when you want it to.
- That's very paradoxical.
(explosion booms)
- (laughs) You know, my browser
used to look like a blast site too.
I had windows and tabs
scattered like debris.
I had YouTube, Wikipedia,
random research articles.
Some things that I swear I never opened.
But that changed when I switched
to today's video sponsor, Opera.
With its free built-in AI tool, Aria,
I can use the quick
shortcut to write a prompt,
and then the chaos is gone.
I can say close all my
YouTube tabs and it's done.
Or I can say, group my chemistry papers
and it creates this tab island.
I can even hover one tab over another tab.
Boom, another island.
Can expand and collapse
them as needed to save
space and stay organized.
I also love that I can ask
Aria anything while researching
like, what year did Alfred Nobel
patent dynamite in England?
And I get the answer instantly
without having to switch tabs.
It's really helpful when
Derek is patiently waiting
for the next version
of my script. (laughs)
If I'm going through an

I can just drag one tab down,
split the screen, and now I can do both.
No need for multiple browser windows.
And if I feel like listening to some music
in the background, Opera's

And now, back to some
explosions. (mimics explosion)
- In 1852, when Alfred returned to Russia,
he moved into a cramped apartment
with his brother Robert,
and he turned their kitchen
into a makeshift lab.
He was searching for a reliable way
to detonate nitroglycerin,
dreaming it could one day
power his father's sea mines.
But when the Crimean war ended in 1856,
the Russian government refused
to honor the contracts
they'd signed during the war.
So the Nobel factory
was forced to shut down,
and Immanuel went bankrupt
for the second time.
Alfred later wrote that
his father was, quote,
"A man of genius, but a
failure all the same."
And so Alfred goes back to Sweden
and he decides, he's like,
"I'm not gonna make the
mistakes of my father."
Where does his mind go?
Sticking with nitroglycerin.
He's like, "If I can make this, you know,
I'll be successful on my own terms."
By the summer of 1862,
a 28-year-old Alfred thought
he was onto something.
Excited, he gathered his brothers
by the banks of Lake Malaren
just behind his workshop in Stockholm,
and he pulled out a metal tube
with a fuse extending from the top.
He ignited it and tossed
it into the water.
(explosion booms)
(Henry laughs)
That's crazy.
He had finally found a way
to reliably detonate nitroglycerin,
and its finished form, it
works something like this.
Alfred took a container of nitroglycerin
and inserted a wooden plug
and packed it with gunpowder.
Then when the fuse was lit, the gunpowder
inside would explode, blasting
down into the container.
And it was that sudden impact
that delivered the shock needed
to detonate the nitroglycerin.
It was just like the
hammer striking the anvil.
We need a blasting cap for this.
All right, so now Jesse's
gonna add a blasting cap.
Alfred Nobel's first major adventure.
(excited music)
I could just like, my heart is
just racing more than usual.
And I know that it's safe, but yeah,
I actually didn't really expect
to feel this nervous about it.
- Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!
Five, four, three, two, one.
(explosion booms)
- Oh my god.
(explosion booms)
Jeez. (laughs)
- [Jesse] Stay down.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Gotta say that, okay,
gotta clear the wrench.
- All clear!
- Oh my God.
- [Jesse] All right, Henry.
Yeah, how do you like that?
- Geez, man.
(explosion booms)
(mysterious music)
- [Jesse] Is that what you came for?
- Yeah, yeah, for sure.
That was insane.
- Look at how it carved out
the exact imprint of the bottle
a foot and a half below.
Okay, look, we even have puncture
on the second to last hole.
The smallest is not punctured.
- [Henry] Yeah. Wow.
- So I mean, that's the entire range
of our measurement capability.
- Yeah. (laughs)
I'm gonna get you
through through. (laughs)
That's awesome. (laughs)
His invention, the
blasting cap, was refined
to use an even more consistent
explosive than gunpowder,
mercury fulminate.
It became the first reliable way
to detonate nitroglycerin on command.
The design was so effective,
it remained virtually
unchanged for decades.
I think it'd be hard to
argue that this advancement
doesn't find its place into every other
explosive device that
comes after it basically.
- Probably the most
significant development
since the invention of gunpowder.
The same idea, using a small explosion
to trigger a much larger
one would later be used
in atomic bombs to set off
nuclear chain reactions.
With the invention of
the blasting cap, the use
of nitroglycerin finally became practical.
- It can break rock and make
tunnels much more effectively.
- Nitroglycerin sped up
industrial excavation.
In one mind, the rate of
tunneling almost doubled
from 0.76 to 1.34 meters per day.
And in Mexico, crews reported
that 15 men using
nitroglycerin could do the work
of 25 with gunpowder.
So orders started pouring
in from mining companies,
engineers, and railway
builders from around the world.
To meet the sudden demand,
Alfred began producing
nitroglycerin in Sweden,
enlisting the help of his
younger brother, Emil.
But on the 3rd of September,
1864, an intern asked Emil
for help moving a heavy crate.
The two began to lift when suddenly,
(explosion booms)
the factory was ripped apart.
(dramatic music)
A witness wrote this of the explosion.
"Most ghastly was the sight
of the mutilated corpses
strewn on the ground.
Not only had their clothes been torn off,
but on some, the head was missing
and the flesh ripped off the bones.
These formless masses of
flesh and bone bore little
or no resemblance to a human body."
Emil, just 21 years old and four others,
the intern, a janitor, a young laborer,
and a passing carpenter
all died in the explosion.
Alfred blamed himself
and he swore, "I will never
let this happen again.
I will make nitroglycerin safe."
(dramatic music)
The city of Stockholm declared
nitroglycerin too dangerous
and banned its production
within city limits.
Alfred, however, refused to give up.
So this is a moment where
he's actually a pretty
savvy entrepreneur.
He says, "Okay, if I'm
not gonna do it on land,
I'm gonna do it on the water."
So he set up a laboratory
on a floating barge on Lake Malaren.
But as he was experimenting, another one
of his factories in Germany exploded.
Alfred was fighting a ticking clock.
With every day that passed,
more lives were lost.
Workers were terrified.
No sane agent would use it.
A mining publication reported
we confidently expect
within 30 days to announce
another serious accident.
See, he had addressed the
problem of detonation,
but not nitroglycerin's
fundamental sensitivity.
Because nitroglycerin is so
viscous, tiny bubbles of air
and water vapor easily get trapped inside.
As we zoom in, you'll
notice there are even more.
These gases are a problem.
When a shockwave reaches
a bubble, it squeezes it,
compressing the gas and heating it up.
And it happens so fast
that the heat can escape.
And so the temperature inside can increase
by thousands of degrees
Celsius in an instant.
It creates a hotspot.
The gas molecules in these
hotspots carry so much energy
that they break the weak N-O bonds
in the nitroglycerin molecules nearby.
And so these molecules then decompose,
releasing even more hot gases.
But nitroglycerin doesn't just
have one of these bubbles.
No, it's filled with them.
So that's what makes it
so sensitive to shock.
A single impact can collapse
many bubbles at once,
which releases enough energy
to trigger the chain reaction
that detonates the entire liquid.
(explosion booms)
Now, you might think to
make nitroglycerin safe,
Alfred just has to get rid
of those bubbles, right?
Well, it's not that easy.
- You have an air bubble trap,
it's like really hard to get that out
without like starting
to, you know, bang on it.
And then you don't wanna do that
because you don't want it to go off.
- But even if you could
remove every single bubble,
you would still have a problem.
That's because nitroglycerin
is a lot like the liquid
in this beer bottle.
I replaced it with water.
And you can see, you know,
there aren't many bubbles.
But if I give it a smack.
(bottle shatters)
Whoa! (laughs)
The impact drives the bottom
of the beer bottle down faster
than the liquid can follow,
which creates this sudden pressure drop.
And that drop of vaporizes the liquid
and creates bubbles.
When the liquid rushes back in,
those bubbles then collapse violently.
And those implosions sometimes
release enough energy to crack the glass.
Now, a similar thing can
happen in nitroglycerin.
A strong impact can create new bubbles
inside the liquid in a
process called cavitation.
And their collapse again
triggers the same chain reaction.
(excited music)
So Alfred realized that the only way
around the bubble problem
was to change the state
of nitroglycerin from a liquid to a solid.
Working on his barge in Germany,
he tried mixing in powdered
charcoal, sand, wood shavings,
brick dust and cement,
but nothing really worked.
(sullen music)
Dejected, he looked down and
noticed something strange,
a fine powder whispering around his feet.
So he looked up
and saw the same pale threads drifting
over the banks of the Elbe.
Millions of years earlier,
that dust had actually been
living organisms, diatoms.
Single-celled algae that
once floated in ancient seas.
But now, in the dunes above the river,
all that remained were their
fossilized exoskeletons.
That made for a fine silica
powder that carried on the wind.
This material, diatomaceous
earth or kieselguhr,
had been appreciated by Darwin.
He wrote, "Few objects are more beautiful
than the minute siliceous
cases of the diatomaceae."
But Alfred saw beyond their beauty
to the microscopic holes
in their exoskeletons.
- [Jesse] On the granular level,
it's got lots of little pores
and places to absorb the liquid into.
- We're looking for what
kind of consistency.
- Oh, it's gonna be
like a thick and solid.
It will make the
nitroglycerin less sensitive.
So the same hammer
impact that you would try
with straight nitroglycerin
would take more force,
because that absorbent
material will take some of
that energy from the impact.
- That kind of feels like we're baking.
- Right.
- [Henry] In fact, kiesleguhr can soak up
more than three times
its weight in liquid nitroglycerin.
- And so if it's porous now, if you mix it
with a nitroglycerin, the nitroglycerin
can kind of go into the pores.
What that helps do is separate
the nitroglycerin
molecules from each other.
- And within any individual pore,
there just isn't enough nitroglycerin
to propagate the detonation.
So now when it's bumped or shaken,
the mixture won't detonate.
And if we drop it in the exact same way
that set off the nitroglycerin.
Drop.
It didn't go.
- No.
- So this new material won't
explode when you drop it.
So can you still detonate it?
Well, if you combine it with
Alfred's other invention,
the blasting cap, the resulting
shockwave is powerful enough
to compress many pockets of
nitroglycerin at the same time,
which triggers the detonation.
(explosion booms)
(bright music)
- [Jesse] The biggest
explosion we've seen up
to now is 100 grams of nitroglycerin.
- [Henry] Yeah, it'll be the
biggest one we've done so far.
- [Jesse] Three, two, one.
(explosion booms)
(Henry laughs)
- [Henry] Oh, that's so sick.
- "To all whom it may concern, be it known
that I, Alfred Nobel have invented a new
and useful composition of matter,
to wit, an explosive powder."
(dramatic music)
To name it, he took the Greek
word dynamis meaning power,
and he made it dynamite.
(explosion booms)
Alfred was determined to
capitalize on his new invention,
and he believed that he could make
the most money in England.
England is a jewel worth the
rest of the world, he said.
A dynamite company there
would have the entire
empire as its market.
So in the spring of 1868,
he set foot on British soil
carrying with him a suitcase
overflowing with dynamite.
- 'Cause he is going around
and he's inviting journalists
to come to these demonstrations
where he would bring sticks
of dynamite in his backpack and a stand.
He would set up these
huge boulders, basically,
and put a stick of dynamite in there
and watch as they like cleft in two.
Alfred was a clever salesman.
So when Alfred created dynamite,
nitroglycerin still had
a terrible reputation.
And so his initial thought was to name it,
"Nobel's safety powder."
- Oh.
I like that.
- Come on down, get you
a Nobel Safety powder.
Blow the hell out of this rock.
You know?
Whatever the name.
His invention came at the perfect time.
Around when Alfred introduced dynamite,
there were two other major breakthroughs,
the pneumatic drill
and the diamond drilling
crown, which now made it easy
to bore holes in solid rock.
Perfect for a stick of dynamite.
(explosion booms)
These tools revolutionized construction.
Many of the iconic engineering feats
of the era from the Brooklyn Bridge
to the Panama Canal depended on dynamite.
One thing that I think
is really interesting
to think about is Russia at the time
isn't the Russia that we think of now.
It was effectively a
mid-sized European country.
'Cause they had this
vast wealth of resources,
but it was cut off by these mountains.
And so without dynamite,
you actually wouldn't have
the Russia we have today
'cause you would've
never been able to make
the Trans Siberian Railroad.
It's worth saying that
dynamite is different than TNT.
- Yeah, I was gonna ask
about that actually.
Trinitroglycerin.
- Trinitrotolu, toluene.
Tolu?
- Trinitrotoluene.
- Yup. Trinitrotoluene.
- Those nitrogens are bound
to carbons, not to oxygens,
and so that makes it much more stable
so you don't have that really
weak oxygen nitrogen bond.
Because of that, it is much,
much, much less sensitive
than nitroglycerin.
- So that actually wouldn't be discovered
for another couple decades after dynamite,
- The TNT labels on the dynamite sticks
in the Looney Tunes
cartoons never bothered me
when I watched them as a kid.
But now I'm just like,
"Wait, that's not right.
They're not TNT in there."
- But the main point is that
dynamite happened first.
And no matter what ACDC
says, it is not TNT.
- It's a good line.
- Yeah, I mean, it's a good track too.
So dynamite was changing the world,
but the old dangers of
nitroglycerin were hard to escape.
(sullen music)
In 1869, near Brentford, England,
a barge carrying dynamite
exploded on the river Thames,
killing three people
and damaging buildings
800 meters away.
Investigators traced the cause to dynamite
that had been sweating
beads of nitroglycerin.
See, wet kieselguhr from the
riverbed has to first be dried
to remove moisture.
And that leaves empty pores
ready to absorb nitroglycerin.
But the kieselguhr never loses
that strong attraction to water.
So if your dynamite is
later exposed to moisture,
even just humidity in the air,
but water seeps back into those pores,
and the invading water molecules
then encounter nitroglycerin,
which gets pushed outwards.
Now, moisture wasn't the only culprit.
Time and temperature could
also cause this separation.
But moisture just made
the problem a lot worse,
though it actually wasn't
Alfred's only concern.
See, kieselguhr is inert,
and since dynamite was
about 25% kieselguhr,
that meant it would always
absorb a large fraction
of the explosive energy,
and that power was wasted.
It reduced the strength
of Alfred's explosive,
and ultimately, it hurt his bottom line.
So he kept experimenting
with new formulations
and new absorbents.
Again and again, he failed.
But he was undeterred saying,
"If I have 1,000 ideas
and only one turns out to
be good, I am satisfied."
Then one day, while working
in his home lab in Paris,
he cut his hand.
It was a pretty deep cut, and
blood started to pour out.
So he grabbed a bandage,
pressed it to the wound,
and watched it soak up the mess.
That night, the pain woke him.
But as he was lying there in the dark,
annoyed at his earlier
carelessness, his mind drifted back
to the bandage, how clean it was,
how fast it absorbed the blood.
He bolted upright and
rushed down to the lab.
He thought, "If cotton is
so good at absorbing blood,
maybe it'll be just as good
at absorbing nitroglycerin."
So inside that bandage is this,
and it looks like regular cotton,
but you'll see it's
not when I light it up.
Woo!
- Yeah, I remember, yeah,
watching this YouTube video
where they just light it on fire
and the whole thing's just gone.
And it is so counterintuitive
and so just crazy to see.
It's like magic.
I'm sure it's used in
like magic shows too.
- Woo!
It's called gun cotton or nitrocellulose.
And nitrocellulose is made
by taking cellulose polymers,
say from cotton or wood pulp.
And then replacing the oh,
groups with oxygen atoms
bonded to nitro groups, which
are the same unstable groups
that made nitroglycerin so explosive.
So now when you ignite it,
these groups rapidly break down
into products like nitrogen,
carbon dioxide, and water.
All of which are gases,
so there's no particulate
to scatter light.
That's why the whole thing
seems to just disappear into thin air.
But what Alfred was interested in
was what happened when you
combined it with nitroglycerin?
See, nitrocellulose has these
chains that are very similar
to nitroglycerin chemically
because of the nitro groups.
So because of that, they mix easily.
- Now you have two
things that are soluble.
They like each other.
This is very different from, you know,
kieselguhr, water and nitroglycerin.
- And now when you mix them,
the smaller nitroglycerin molecules slip
between these long nitrocellulose chains,
trapping the nitroglycerin
molecules and keeping them apart.
Just like in the dynamite.
If you mix in just a small
amount of nitrocellulose,
you get a stable moldable
gel that resists sweating.
We're take a little bit
of the nitrocellulose,
a gun cotton like this much.
- Yeah.
- Okay, we're gonna
start with a little bit.
We're gonna drop it in there.
You see that it soaks right in.
- [Jesse] Yeah, yeah.
- Keep on adding bits
until it soaks all up
and then we'll stir it around to make sure
there's no dry spots.
But that's not all.
This mixture also solves
Alfred's problem of yield.
The matrix, like the structure
that it's being held
in is itself explosive.
So now you get perfect yield,
no sweating, ding, bang, boom.
And because the material is a gel,
it can be molded into different shapes,
perfect for precise
controlled mining blasts.
- [Jesse] While it's soft like this,
we can put it into a shape,
and then when it sets,
it'll stay that shape.
- We enough to do a VE?
- Oh yeah, yeah.
Let's make a VE.
(explosion booms)
(mysterious music)
- Alfred named it Gelignite.
The world's first moldable explosive.
With gelignite, dynamite,
and the blasting cap in hand,
Alfred had fulfilled his oath.
He had made explosives safer everyone.
He opened factories across
the world, in Scotland,
France, the United States and beyond.
By the early 1870s,
he was running more than
90 sites in 20 countries.
But not everyone was happy.
His father never recovered from
Emil's death and just weeks
after the explosion in Stockholm,
Immanuel suffered a stroke.
He survived, but was never the same.
Immanuel became obsessed
with death, often rambling
to Alfred about strange
inventions, including a scheme
to build a network of underground tubes
that would carry corpses
directly from people's homes
to giant incinerators.
- His dad never had the
success that Alfred's having,
you know, financially,
and he's being lauded
as this great inventor.
His dad, I think, is
just jealous essentially.
But he claims that Alfred
had stolen the idea
for dynamite from him.
- So he says to his dad,
"Rather than regarding this idea
as your own, far from
it, you laughed at it.
Your fatherly love
seems to run aground on
complacency or vanity.
It should not seem strange
that I, at the age of 30,
will not allow myself to
be treated as a schoolboy.
It pains me but when it
comes to serious matters,
I've adopted the rule of acting seriously.
Despite the confident front
he put up for his father,
the truth was that his wealth
hadn't made him any happier.
He says, "I'm two steps
ahead of my competitors,
but the accumulation of money
and praise leaves me totally indifferent.
My home is where I work,
and I work everywhere.
I am a nomadic atom with
no attachments, no roots,
and no real joy in life.
By 1876, he couldn't take it anymore.
Overwhelmed by the
loneliness, he placed an ad.
Wealthy, highly educated,
elderly gentleman seeks lady
of mature age, versed in
languages as secretary
and supervisor of household.
And into his life, entered Bertha Kinsky.
She was an idealistic woman,
part of the Budding Peace Movement.
Together, they took long carriage rides
where they discussed the
role of science and society
and whether it could serve
a purpose greater than war.
For a moment, Alfred was happy.
Hopeful, he asked if her heart was free.
But while Alfred was away on business,
she left to be with
another man in Austria.
So Alfred was back to being alone.
Alfred was heartbroken.
He responded by throwing himself
even deeper into his work.
Alfred attempted to sell his explosives
to the French military, but
they weren't interested.
Then a year later, when war
broke out between France
and Prussia, German troops hurled dynamite
at the French positions.
Now, Alfred received a message.
The French wanted to place an order.
- One thing that I think is important
to like think about in this moment
is that people have been
stabbed, bruised, shot with gunpowder
and all this other
stuff, but up till then,
it would've been totally
foreign to see that level
of destruction on a human body.
- Yeah, it would've been unmatched
in kind of human history.
- As he starts thinking more about war
and becoming involved with
like the French military,
the German military, the Italian military.
They come to him with a problem
that's been plaguing them
for hundreds of years since
the invention of gunpowder,
which is that on a
battlefield with black powder.
When you shoot, it obscures visibility
so you don't really
know how to shoot again.
Like, you can't aim very well.
Yeah, one thing you're
seeing with the black powder
is that every time it explodes,
there's just this huge plume
of smoke that enemy fighters
would be able to see your location.
So it's just this big problem
where there's like a literal fog of war.
Alfred starts contemplating that problem.
What he thinks back to is gun cotton.
You know, it doesn't create smoke.
Can I use gun cotton to replace powder?
But the problem with using gun cotton
or any high explosive mass in small arms
is that it detonates all at once,
releasing its energy in a split second,
and the pressure inside
the barrel spikes faster
than the bullet can accelerate.
So much of the energy is wasted as heat.
Instead of propelling the projectile,
it can even destroy the barrel.
What Alfred wanted was a propellant
that built pressure gradually,
so the forest rose smoothly
as the bullet traveled down the barrel.
So he began experimenting
with a new nitroglycerin
nitrocellulose mixture.
By adding 10 to 20 times
more nitrocellulose
than a gelignite, he transformed it
from a jelly into a tougher substance,
one that could be rolled into
pasta thin sheets in Italy.
They even used pasta makers to do this.
These sheets were then stamped
into countless tiny little grains.
When these grains were
packed into a cartridge,
they wouldn't fit tightly.
Small gaps of air remained between them,
but that was actually a good thing.
Now, when one grain ignited, a shockwave
couldn't just race through
the entire charge at once.
Instead, each grain had
to ignite its neighbor.
And the one beside it, and
the next one in sequence.
This slowed down the burn rate
and allowed the pressure
to build gradually.
So they were able to replicate
the effect of gunpowder.
And because the fuel was a
combination of nitroglycerin
and nitrocellulose, both of
which broke down into clear,
stable gases, it burned with little smoke.
So Alfred had solved a problem
that had plagued armies for centuries,
- And to this day, the propellant in much
of the world's ammunition
is still a combination
of nitroglycerin and nitrocellulose.
Just like Alfred's invention,
he called it ballistite,
the world's first smokeless
high energy propellant.
Alfred quickly received an
order for 300,000 kilograms
of ballistite from the Italian army.
So he opened a massive
armaments factory in Italy
and began to fall deeper
into the world of warfare.
He developed landmines,
early gun silencers,
and even experimented with one
of the first rocket-powered missiles.
It flew over four kilometers down range,
and allegedly captured this image.
- The whole time, he's
in contact with Bertha,
like the woman who kind of jilted him,
and she's become pretty
important in the peace movement
at the time.
She wrote this book called
"Lay Down Your Arms."
That became kind of a sensation
and established these peace
congresses across the world.
To her, he insisted, "My
rockets are meant not only
for war, but also for the
rescue of shipwrecked persons."
He even took it a step further.
"Perhaps my factories will put an end
to war sooner than your congresses.
On the day that two army corps
can mutually annihilate
each other in a second.
All civilized nations will
surely recoil with horror
and disband their troops."
This is a concept that we see a lot of.
When people are sure to kill each other
with the modern weapons
that I've given them,
no war will be possible.
It's also the same thing that
we think about in Oppenheimer.
- I feel like we've heard it so many times
that you just can't believe it ever.
- No.
- And then it's just marketing on the part
of all these guys who are selling weapons.
They don't wanna come across
as evil guys who are like,
"I'm gonna make something
that'll help you kill
more people than ever before."
I mean, that's kind of the truth of it,
- Especially in the dynamite case.
It feels like a tremendous
misjudgment of human nature.
It's like, yeah.
- Yeah.
- This is not gonna be
used for to stop war.
And we definitely don't see
that in the decades that follow.
(jazz music)
Between the 1890s and the
1920s, over 7,000 bombings
occurred in New York alone.
Imagine waking up, opening the paper
and seeing another explosion
every other day for decades.
(sullen music)
The most common perpetrators were known
as the Dynamite Club.
They were part of a deadly
new political movement
on the rise in America.
They rejected industrialization
and longed for a simpler world.
Today, their name evokes
chaos and destruction.
But at the time, it was more literal.
No ruler, an-ackhos.
This was anarchy.
They were so crazy and so
effective using dynamite
that Theodore Roosevelt
addressed Congress,
and he said, "The largest
threat facing the US
is the anarchist threat."
- Were they intentionally
just killing people?
- Yeah.
Their argument was that, you know,
if if one person dies at
the hands of an anarchist,
100 people have died in
the industrial machine.
Yeah.
- These people sound crazy.
In fact, the entire modern practice
of terrorism using spectacular violence
to advance a political agenda,
often targeting civilians,
but that all began with the
anarchists and their dynamite.
Dynamite unlocked a new scale
of destruction previously unimaginable.
With only a few sticks in a coat pocket,
one person could walk into a
crowded street and wreak havoc.
What began as an industrial tool
had become a weapon of mass murder.
In 1927 in Bath, Michigan,
a man spent months wiring
the town's new elementary
school with dynamite.
He hid the charges in the basement
and crawl spaces,
concealed them under floors
and behind walls, all while serving
as the school board treasurer.
Then on the morning of May
18th, just after classes began,
he triggered the explosives.
As parents and rescuers
rushed to the scene,
he arrived in a truck
packed with more dynamite
and shrapnel and detonated.
In all, 38 children, six
adults, and the attacker died.
Another 58 were grievously injured.
The deadliest school
massacre in American history
was not a shooting.
It was a dynamite attack.
Of course, Alfred
couldn't know all the ways
in which his inventions would be abused,
but he had seen the
destruction in his own life,
and he had heard the
pleas to change his ways.
So in 1888, when he read that paper,
something in him broke.
(somber music)
Just a few years later, as
his health began to fail,
as he took pellets of nitroglycerin
to ease the pain in his chest,
he couldn't shake the thought.
So he called his lawyer
and wrote a new will.
With 94% of his personal fortune,
31.2 million Swedish kronor
or about $340 million today,
he created a set of prizes for those who,
during the preceding
year, shall have conferred
the greatest benefit on
mankind, the Nobel Prize.
There were five in total.
For chemistry, physics,
medicine, literature,
and finally, peace.
(gentle music)
On December 10th, 1896,
Alfred Nobel died in his villa in Italy.
Just as he had always
feared, he died alone.
At the time of his death,
he held 355 patents
and ran an empire of 90 factories
that produced explosives
and armaments across the world.
And yet, in his final act,
he gave his fortune away
for an idea.
So did it work?
Did it redeem him in the
eyes of everyone today?
- Have you ever heard
the name Alfred Nobel?
- Oh yeah.
He was the creator of
the Nobel Peace Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Nobel Prize.
- Anything else?
- I should know more.
- The Nobel Prize.
- Is that it?
- Yes.
- I'm saying like nothing like dynamite.
Don't think about that at all?
- Dynamite?
- Yeah.
He also invented dynamite.
- Did not know that.
- I didn't know about the dynamite.
I knew about the Peace
Prize, but that's it.
- I think the attempt has
been to have him portrayed
as somebody who tried to promote
new understanding and advances in science.
And so that's-
- That's his legacy.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- It would seem.
- I mean, if you're cynical,
you say it's a PR move.
And are you inclined to be cynical?
- I think it must be at
least somewhat a PR move.
To me, like Nobel Prize
has always been like
the pinnacle of achievement.
If anyone wins the Nobel
Prizes, like, yeah, you're done.
Like that's all you need
to accomplish in life.
I mean, in some ways, like
maybe he was in control
of his legacy.
- Yes, and he took control of his legacy.
- He did.
- He decided he wanted it
to be a positive thing.
There's a twisted irony to the story.
When Alfred Nobel created
dynamite, he was trying
to make explosive safer to prevent
the kind of accident
that killed his brother.
But by making nitroglycerin
easier to handle,
he also made it more accessible
and that made it more deadly.
So why then did he create the Nobel Prizes?
Was it out of the goodness of his heart?
Or a desire to redeem himself in the eyes of everyone
who would come after?
I mean, I think
the idea that anyone anywhere
can be recognised
for advancing science,
literature or peace
is beautiful.
- 'This award is not just a piece of metal
that you would wear
an award that you would keep in your room
but, this is really an encouragement for me
to go forward and
to believe in myself.
To know that there are people
who are supporting me
in this campaign.'
So maybe it doesn't matter why he did it,
only that he did.
