the
 Stock
 Movers
 Report,
 your
 roundup
 of


companies
 making
 moves
 in
 the
 stock


market,
 harnessing
 the
 power
 of


Bloomberg
 data.
 Welcome
 to
 the
 Stock


Movers
 podcast.
 I'm
 Charlie
 Pellet.


Joining
 us
 today,
 Bloomberg's
 Christine


Aino,
 managing
 editor
 for
 Markets
 Live.


Got
 to
 begin
 with
 the
 homebuilders


because
 there
 was
 quite
 the
 move
 today


in
 PY.
 what
 was
 going
 on
 with
 PY
 Home.


Yeah,
 absolutely
 Charlie.
 So,
 PY
 groups


at
 ticker
 PHM,
 those
 shares
 finished


lower
 by
 4.9%.


And
 this
 is
 because
 we
 have
 seen
 a


series
 of
 social
 media
 posts
 from


President
 Donald
 Trump
 as
 well
 as
 the


Federal
 Housing
 Finance
 Agency
 director


Bill
 Py
 essentially
 pressuring
 home


builders
 to
 build
 homes,
 which
 I
 guess


you
 could
 say
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense,
 but


it's
 just
 that
 added
 pressure
 from
 the


administration
 that's
 really
 uh
 lighting


a
 fire
 under
 the
 stocks
 in
 not
 a


positive
 way.
 And
 we
 should
 note,
 of


course,
 that
 uh
 Bill
 Py
 is
 the
 grandson


of
 William
 J.
 PY
 who
 founded
 PY
 Group.


So,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 irony
 there,
 but


yes,
 we
 have
 seen
 her
 comments


essentially
 just
 pressure
 the
 whole


homebuilder
 sector
 in
 general.
 Uh
 we've


seen
 a
 gauge
 by
 the
 S&P
 uh
 down
 over


9.6%
 just
 over
 4
 days.
 That's
 down
 more


than
 19.5
 billion
 in
 terms
 of
 market


value
 over
 this
 period.


Indeed,
 PY
 down
 every
 single
 day
 this


week,
 dropping
 4.9%
 today.
 And
 not
 just


PY,
 but
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 other
 home


builders
 down,
 Dr.
 R.
 Horton
 down
 4.6%.


KB
 was
 down
 4
 1.5%.
 Toll
 Brothers
 down


2.6%.


Let
 us
 move
 beyond
 housing,
 the


homebuilders,
 and
 into
 earnings,


specifically
 the
 airlines
 and
 Delta.


Delta
 stock
 up
 today.
 What
 was
 going
 on


with
 Delta
 after
 earnings?


Yeah,
 some
 good
 news
 for
 Delta
 here,


Charlie.
 So,
 Delta,
 ticker
 D,
 those


shares
 finished
 4.3%
 higher.
 We
 did
 get


updated
 guidance
 from
 the
 carrier


regarding
 its
 adjusted
 earnings
 per


share
 forecast
 for
 the
 full
 year
 and
 new


guidance
 that
 also
 beat
 the
 analyst


estimate.
 So
 now
 they're
 seeing
 adjusted


EPS
 at
 about
 $6,
 whereas
 the
 analyst


estimate
 was
 at
 580.
 So
 very
 interesting


bit
 of
 good
 news,
 especially
 seems
 like


it's
 a
 time
 when
 all
 we
 get
 is
 bad
 news


from
 airlines
 these
 days,
 isn't
 it?
 But


yeah,
 this
 is
 a
 rare
 bit
 of
 good
 news


for
 them
 at least.


Indeed.
 We
 saw
 United
 move
 higher
 today.


We
 saw
 American
 Airlines
 decline
 though.


U
 is
 there
 any
 veracity?
 Is
 it
 worth


talking
 about
 Delta
 Airlines
 as
 an


economic
 indicator?


I
 mean
 certainly
 and
 that's
 something
 I


think
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 analysts
 on
 the


street
 are
 still
 potentially
 worried


about.
 We
 did
 hear
 from
 chief
 executive


officer
 Ed
 Bastian
 saying
 that
 their


customer
 is
 in
 a
 financially
 good
 spot.


they're
 not
 not
 necessarily
 seeing
 any


pullback
 in
 demand.
 But
 that's
 of
 course


something
 that
 you
 would
 expect
 a
 CEO
 of


an
 airline
 to
 say.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 for


analysts
 the
 concern
 is
 really
 whether


they
 will
 be
 able
 to
 push
 their
 premium


products
 because
 this
 is
 something
 that


Delta
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 do
 more
 of
 and


whether
 consumers
 will
 be
 able
 to
 absorb


uh
 the
 cost
 of
 these
 premium
 products


especially
 at
 a
 time
 when
 inflation
 just


in
 general
 still
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 worry
 for


a
 lot
 of
 American
 households.
 Yeah,
 I


heard
 Delta
 too
 talking
 about
 the


quarter
 saying
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 travelers


also
 too
 are
 choosing
 not
 to
 go
 in
 the


hot
 summer
 season,
 especially
 some
 of


the
 older
 travelers
 who
 want
 to
 move
 or


go
 to
 Europe
 when
 say
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


a
 little
 bit
 cooler,
 not
 as
 hot,
 and


that's
 also
 helping
 bookings
 into
 the


fourth
 quarter.
 Now,
 also
 out
 today
 with


earnings,
 PepsiCo,
 how
 do
 they
 fare?


Yeah,
 PepsiCo
 finishing
 the
 day
 higher


as
 well.
 So
 ticker
 PEP
 those
 shares
 up


more
 than
 4%.
 And
 we
 did
 get
 their


annual
 profit
 outlook
 and
 the
 analysts


are
 just
 seeing
 some
 positives
 here.


Right?
 So
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 actual


outlook,
 you
 know,
 they're
 still
 seeing


uh
 operating
 profits
 at
 3.6
 billion.
 Uh


still
 below
 estimates,
 net
 revenue,
 uh


slightly
 above
 estimates,
 23.94


billion.
 This
 is
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 third


quarter
 results.
 Um,
 in
 terms
 of
 their


actual
 outlook,
 they're
 seeing
 low


singledigit
 boost
 in
 organic
 revenue.


But
 I
 think
 what
 analysts
 are
 really


seizing
 upon
 here
 is
 the
 fact
 that


PepsiCo
 is
 working
 to
 cut
 costs
 and


overhaul
 its
 portfolio
 and
 they're
 doing


it
 with
 such
 urgency.
 uh
 chief
 executive


officer
 uh
 Rammon
 Laguarta
 did
 speak
 to


analysts
 on
 a
 call
 on
 Thursday
 morning


and
 they
 say
 that
 they
 are
 still
 a
 few


areas
 that
 they
 need
 to
 work
 on
 but


they're
 doing
 this
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 urgency


and
 there
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 of


constructive
 discussions
 and
 at least


for
 today
 investors
 are
 taking
 that
 to


be
 a
 positive
 thing


indeed
 we
 saw
 shares
 of
 PepsiCo


advancing
 as
 you
 say
 interestingly


though
 rival
 CocaCola
 uh
 it
 was
 up
 today


by
 just
 about
 4/10en
 of
 1%
 sent


Coca-Cola
 reports
 on
 October
 21st.
 Is
 it


safe
 to
 say
 so
 goes
 Pepsi,
 then
 we'll
 go


Coca-Cola?


I
 mean,
 you'd
 think
 that
 they
 would
 be


working
 or,
 you
 know,
 moving
 in
 tandem


in
 this
 particular
 market
 given
 uh
 that


competition,
 right?
 And
 so
 for
 for
 both


of
 these
 brands
 really
 um
 it
 just


depends
 on
 how
 they
 manage
 to


differentiate
 uh
 from
 each
 other
 uh
 in


terms
 of
 you
 know
 PepsiCo's
 approach
 to


things.
 Um
 analysts
 are
 pointing
 to
 the


fact
 that
 you
 know
 there
 there's
 uh
 some


fourth
 quarter
 trends
 that
 could
 show


some
 improvement
 uh
 particularly
 when
 it


comes
 to
 mitigating
 tariff
 actions
 and


perhaps
 also
 weather
 might
 play
 a
 part.


There
 might
 be
 less
 weather
 related


pressure
 particularly
 when
 it
 comes
 to


their
 international
 beverage
 line.


All
 right
 uh
 Christina
 Kino
 always


appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you
