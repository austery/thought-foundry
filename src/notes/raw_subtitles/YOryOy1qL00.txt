Surfing
 well
 requires
 me
 to
 activate


dozens
 of
 muscles
 across
 my
 body,


combining
 explosive
 power
 with
 balance


and
 strength.
 It's
 a
 full
 body
 workout


disguised
 as
 effortless
 grace.
 Oh,
 by


the
 way,
 that's
 that's
 not
 me.
 Did
 you


think
 that
 was
 me?
 That
 guy
 is
 amazing.


I
 have
 no
 idea
 how
 he's
 doing
 that.
 When


I
 surf,
 it
 doesn't
 look
 anything
 like


that.
 It
 looks
 a
 lot
 more
 like
 this.
 Not


catching
 a
 wave.
 paddling
 extremely
 hard


and
 almost
 catching
 a
 wave


and
 trying
 to
 pretend
 that
 I
 have
 caught


a
 wave.


Look,
 I'm
 not
 what
 you'd
 call
 physically


strong.
 I
 am
 more
 comfortable
 surfing


the
 internet
 than
 I
 am
 surfing
 the


ocean.
 All
 of
 my
 life,
 I
 have
 relied


more
 on
 my
 mind
 than
 on
 my
 body.
 But
 as


I
 approach
 my
 40s,
 I've
 started
 to
 feel


pain
 in
 weird
 places.
 I've
 gotten
 winded


in
 ways
 that
 I
 never
 got
 winded
 before.


So,
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is
 time
 to
 maybe


start
 paying
 attention
 to
 muscles
 and
 to


even
 dip
 my
 toe
 into
 getting
 stronger.


But,
 as
 you
 can
 see,


I'm
 going
 to
 need
 some
 help.


Bonnie
 Toy
 is
 a
 journalist,
 a
 surfer,


and
 the
 author
 of
 the
 book
 On
 Muscle:


The
 Stuff
 That
 Moves
 Us
 and
 Why
 It


Matters.
 Bonnie.


>> Hi,
 Chris.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 doing
 this.


>> Hey,
 it's
 great
 to
 see
 you.


>> Wow.


>> Welcome.
 really
 beautiful.


>> I'm
 meeting
 up
 with
 her
 to
 find
 out
 more


about
 the
 surprising
 science
 of
 muscles


and
 how
 it's
 changing
 who
 and
 what
 we


think
 of
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 physical


fitness.


>> So,
 Bonnie,
 you
 wrote
 the
 book
 on
 muscle


and
 I'm
 curious
 what
 writing
 and


researching
 this
 book
 made
 you
 think


differently
 about
 when
 it
 comes
 to


strength.


>> I
 think
 this
 all
 goes
 back
 to
 what
 I


learned
 from
 growing
 up
 having
 the
 dad
 I


had
 who
 was
 not
 just
 an
 artist
 but
 a


martial
 artist.
 I
 think
 this
 was
 so


integral
 to
 my
 growing
 up
 in
 getting
 me


to
 understand
 from
 a
 very
 early
 age
 that


the
 body
 is
 beautiful
 because
 of
 what
 it


can
 do.
 If
 you
 understand
 that
 these


muscles
 that
 you're
 building
 are
 helping


you
 live
 a
 better
 life,
 a
 longer
 life,
 a


healthier
 life,
 one
 that
 helps
 your


cognitive
 health.
 Like
 your
 muscles
 are


always
 talking
 to
 your
 brain
 and
 having


conversations
 that
 you
 don't
 hear.


One
 thing
 that
 I
 learned
 was
 that


muscles
 are
 not
 just
 for
 like
 moving
 you


around
 mechanically,
 but
 they
 are
 an


endocrine
 tissue.
 And
 so
 they're
 always


talking.
 They're
 super
 chatty.
 They
 are


releasing
 these
 signaling
 molecules
 that


travel
 all
 around
 your
 body
 to
 talk
 to


all
 these
 different
 parts
 of
 it,


including
 your
 brain,
 and
 are
 telling


your
 brain
 to
 do
 certain
 beneficial


things.


>> So
 what
 should
 we
 be
 doing?
 I
 think
 what


has
 been
 a
 sea
 change
 over
 the
 last


several
 years
 is
 that
 weightlifting
 is


something
 that
 the
 medical


establishment,
 your
 doctor
 uh
 will
 be


telling
 you
 and
 your
 mom
 and
 your


grandmother
 is
 it
 that
 is
 something
 that


they
 have
 to
 be
 doing.


>> You
 said
 that
 pretty
 much
 everyone
 like


there's
 this
 big
 change
 that
 now
 pretty


much
 everyone
 should
 be
 lifting
 heavy.
 I


want
 to
 ask
 you


>> how
 and
 why.
 Most
 of
 us
 understand
 that


as
 we
 get
 older,
 we
 lose
 bone
 mass.
 And


less
 people
 are
 familiar
 with
 the
 fact


that
 in
 your
 30s,
 sorry
 everyone,
 you


start
 losing
 muscle.
 So
 it's
 like
 age


related
 muscle
 mass.
 It
 is
 normal
 for


everyone.
 So
 what
 that
 really
 means
 is


that
 in
 your
 30s,
 you
 need
 to
 start


thinking
 about
 who
 you
 want
 to
 be
 and


what
 you
 want
 to
 be
 capable
 of
 doing
 in


your
 40s,
 50s,
 60s,7s,
 and
 beyond.
 Much


as
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 spend
 the
 rest
 of
 the


day
 eating
 pasta
 on
 the
 couch,
 Bonnie


really
 did
 convince
 me
 that
 building


muscle
 matters
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 I


thought.


So,
 with
 that,
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 a
 little


training
 from
 her
 to
 build
 the
 strength


that
 I'm
 going
 to
 need
 if
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 tackle
 these
 waves
 and
 be


able
 to
 grab
 a
 can
 off
 the
 top
 shelf


when
 I'm
 70
 years
 old.


>> Always
 start
 off
 with
 a
 warm
 up.
 Okay.


>> Okay.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 do
 some
 jumping


jacks.


>> Okay.
 Go.


And
 then
 let's
 do
 some
 burpees.


>> Two.


[Laughter]


>> Three.


>> I
 swear
 this
 here
 is
 me
 trying
 my


hardest.


>> Four.


>> Five.


>> Oh,
 that
 was
 five.
 Oh,
 thank
 God.


Okay,


>> we'll
 front
 kick
 towards
 We'll
 start


with
 the
 right
 side.
 Okay,


>> so
 like
 this.


>> Yes,


>> except
 I'm
 not
 grunting.


>> You
 You
 can
 grunt
 if
 you
 want
 to.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 do
 without
 grunting.


>> Right,
 return,
 left,
 return,
 right,


return.
 Yeah.


>> Okay,
 cool.


>> It
 just
 feels
 like
 yours
 is
 like
 a


martial
 art
 and
 mine
 is
 like
 dog
 using
 a


fire
 hydrant.


>> So,
 you
 want
 to
 do
 a
 plank
 off?


>> Sure.


All
 right.


>> Oh
 boy.
 After
 that
 workout,
 I
 was
 sore


in
 places
 that
 I
 didn't
 even
 realize


were
 muscles.
 Oh
 god.


>> Using
 all
 of
 my
 muscles
 at
 once
 prompted


actually
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 strange


question
 for
 Bonnie.
 What's
 your


favorite
 muscle?


>> Can
 you
 point
 that?


>> Well,
 you
 won't
 see
 it
 on
 this
 map.
 And


that
 those
 are
 the
 muscles
 that
 give
 you


goosebumps.


>> Oh,
 that's
 cool.


>> The
 erector
 peely.
 And
 these
 little


muscle
 fibers
 that
 attach
 to
 your


bottoms
 of
 your
 hair
 follicles.


And
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 every
 time


you're
 cold
 and
 you
 get
 goosebumps
 when


those
 muscles
 contract,
 it's
 trying
 to


warm
 you
 up.
 And
 also
 when
 you're


scared,
 the
 hairs
 on
 your
 back
 and
 your


neck
 all
 go
 up.
 and
 think
 about
 a


porcupine
 being
 so
 frightened
 that
 their


quills
 go
 up.
 And
 then
 also
 of
 extreme


emotion,
 like
 awe.
 I
 think
 those
 are
 the


most
 underrated
 muscles
 to
 be
 quite


honest.
 And
 we
 all
 have
 them.


>> I
 got
 goosebumps
 hearing
 you
 talk
 about


goosebumps.


>> That's
 a
 great
 favorite
 muscle
 because


I'll
 tell
 you
 this,
 my
 erector
 pilly


were
 flexing
 goosebumps
 all
 over
 me
 as


we
 prepared
 to
 venture
 into
 the


relentless
 ocean.
 Cold,
 check.
 Awe,


check.
 Fear
 definitely
 check.
 You
 love


being
 in
 the
 water
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 on


muscle.
 You're
 also
 talking
 about


surfing.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 your


relationship
 to
 surfing?


>> It's
 mostly
 love
 and
 sometimes
 hate


mostly
 because
 I
 hate
 that
 I'm
 not


better
 at
 it
 all
 the
 time.


>> All
 right.


>> All right.
 Let's
 go
 waves.
 I
 love
 it.
 I


love
 it
 so
 much.
 I
 love
 the
 feeling
 of


flying
 and
 of
 flow
 and
 this
 dance
 that


happens
 with
 the
 water
 and
 how
 the
 ocean


is
 your
 dance
 partner
 and
 you
 have
 to


work
 with
 that
 dance
 partner
 and


sometimes
 your
 dance
 partner
 is
 feeling


especially
 strong
 and
 rambunctious
 and


you're
 trying
 to
 wrestle
 that
 dance


partner
 into
 cooperating
 with
 you.
 All


right,
 turn
 around.
 Turn
 around
 and
 try


it.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 party.
 What
 is


the
 connection
 specifically
 between


surfing
 and
 muscle
 and
 strength?


>> I
 mean,
 for
 me,
 surfing
 is
 the
 most


joyful
 at
 this
 moment
 manifestation
 of


muscle
 and
 strength
 and
 what
 I
 can
 use


my
 body
 for
 in
 the
 world.


>> I
 love
 wrestling
 with
 the
 ocean.
 I
 love


like
 understanding
 that
 the
 ocean
 itself


has
 its
 muscularity.


>> It's
 an
 energy
 transfer.


Yeah,
 Bonnie.


>> Watching
 Bonnie
 surf
 so
 effortlessly,
 so


gracefully
 while
 I
 was
 flailing
 just
 to


keep
 up,
 it
 made
 me
 wonder
 whether
 I


would
 ever
 have
 the
 same
 command
 over
 my


body
 as
 she
 does.


>> If
 you
 stop
 100
 people
 on
 the
 street
 and


ask
 them,
 "What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 when
 you


think
 of
 the
 word
 muscle?"
 I
 think
 there


is
 a
 very
 specific
 kind
 of
 body


stereotypically
 and
 a
 very
 particular


kind
 of
 person
 who
 gets
 to
 have
 that


body
 and
 often
 times
 it's
 someone
 who's


in
 the
 gym,
 someone
 who's
 a
 bodybuilder,


someone
 who
 looks
 like
 Arnold


Schwarzenegger.
 What
 I
 learned
 is
 that


it
 goes
 so
 much
 deeper
 than
 that.


>> There's
 an
 interesting
 metaphor,
 I


guess,
 in
 muscle
 in
 that
 the
 way
 that


you
 build
 a
 muscle
 is
 by
 tearing
 it.
 So,


it
 has
 to
 break
 and
 then
 it
 rebuilds


stronger.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


So
 when
 you
 paddle,


try
 to
 be
 deliberate
 with
 your
 paddles.


Yeah.
 And
 don't
 don't
 do
 this
 so
 much.


So
 it's
 just
 lifting.
 Yeah.
 There
 are


all
 these
 characteristics
 of
 muscle
 that


the
 tangible
 stuff,
 right?
 So
 strength


and
 form
 and
 you
 know
 action
 that
 it
 is


the
 stuff
 that
 actually
 moves
 us
 and


flexibility
 and
 endurance.
 And
 these
 are


not
 just
 qualities
 of
 muscle,
 but
 they


are
 qualities
 that
 we
 strive
 for
 in


personhood.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 You
 got
 this.
 Aim
 for
 that
 peak.


Aim.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.
 Go.


>> You
 can
 only
 strengthen
 a
 muscle
 by


stressing
 it,
 by
 pushing
 it,
 by


challenging
 it.
 And
 And
 that's
 something


that
 I
 think
 we
 all
 understand.
 We
 can


look
 at
 life
 as
 something
 that
 always
 is


stressing
 us,
 is
 always
 throwing
 these


challenges
 at
 us.


Oh
 my
 god,
 that
 was
 so
 close.


>> So
 close.
 And
 yet
 no
 cigar.


>> I
 love
 Bonnie's
 point
 that
 pushing
 and


stressing
 and
 building
 up
 our
 muscles
 is


also
 about
 pushing
 and
 stressing
 and


building
 up
 ourselves.
 We
 can't
 grow


unless
 we
 are
 out
 of
 our
 comfort
 zone.


>> You
 went
 and
 visited
 with
 the
 strongest


people
 on
 the
 planet,
 people
 who
 are


quite
 literally
 like
 have
 lifted
 the


heaviest
 weights
 imaginable,
 pushing
 the


boundaries
 of
 what
 humans
 can
 actually


lift.
 You
 talk
 about
 how
 the
 strength


community
 is
 actually
 really
 inspiring


to
 you
 in
 ways
 that
 are
 surprising


because
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 can
 I
 lift
 a


600
 lb
 rock,


>> right?


>> It's
 actually
 about
 something
 bigger


than
 that.
 So,
 I'd
 love
 to
 have
 you
 um


read
 this
 quote
 um
 for
 me.


>> But
 the
 strength
 community's
 insatiable


curiosity
 about
 the
 human
 body
 is


something
 I
 find
 surprisingly
 moving.


>> All right,
 let's
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


wave
 dance.


A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 wave
 dance.


Come
 to
 us.
 To
 know
 one's
 own
 strength.


I've
 come
 to
 understand
 the
 meaning
 of


these
 words
 not
 as
 a
 binary
 statement


and
 I
 do
 or
 and
 I
 don't,
 but
 as
 an


ongoing
 process
 of
 discovery.
 All right,


Chris,
 stop.


All right,
 let's
 turn
 around
 and
 paddle


straight
 in
 as
 hard
 as
 you
 can.
 Yeah.


Muscles
 matter.
 They
 allow
 us
 in
 an


observable
 way
 to
 see
 what
 we
 can
 do.


>> Though
 you
 may
 not
 initially
 know
 what


you're
 capable
 of,
 you
 have
 vast


reservoirs
 of
 potential
 waiting
 to
 be


tapped
 for
 just
 the
 right
 moment
 to
 be


revealed.


>> All
 right,
 there's
 another
 chance.


There's
 another
 one
 coming.


>> Stay
 where
 I
 am.


>> Yeah.
 Go
 straight.


>> Hard,
 hard,
 hard.


>> How
 do
 we
 know
 our
 true
 potential?


I
 think
 that
 we
 don't
 know
 until
 we
 try.


And
 I
 think
 that's


both
 the
 beauty
 and
 the
 terror
 of


trying.


I
 did
 it.
 I
 can't
 believe
 it.
 I
 did
 it.


It
 only
 took
 20,000
 tries
 and
 5
 hours
 of


effort.


Look,
 I
 I
 guess
 I'll
 probably
 always
 be


a
 brain
 over
 brawn
 kind
 of
 guy,
 but


spending
 the
 afternoon
 with
 Bonnie
 made


me
 realize
 that
 muscles
 aren't
 just
 meat


rubber
 bands
 in
 our
 bodies.
 They're
 also


inextricably
 intertwined
 with
 who
 we


are,
 how
 we
 see
 ourselves,
 and
 how
 we


feel.


>> Yeah,
 baby.


>> Yeah,
 baby.


>> Yeah,
 baby.


>> What
 should
 people
 do
 to
 put
 these
 ideas


into
 practice?
 I
 would
 love
 for
 you,
 the


listener,
 to
 think
 about
 something
 that


involves
 movement
 that
 you
 love.
 You


know,
 maybe
 it's
 jumping
 a
 rope,
 maybe


it's
 swimming,
 maybe
 it's
 playing
 pickup


basketball,
 maybe
 it's,
 you
 know,
 just


being
 outside
 more
 than
 you
 have
 been
 in


your
 regular
 life.


>> Party.
 Keep
 moving
 because
 that's
 what


life
 is.


>> We
 did
 it.
 We
 did
 it.
