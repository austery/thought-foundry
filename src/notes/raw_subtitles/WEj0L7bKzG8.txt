Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.


Folks,
 we
 are
 green
 in
 the
 pre-markets


and
 uh
 we're
 really
 green.
 And
 the


reason
 we
 are
 really
 green,
 when
 I
 mean


really
 green,
 I
 mean
 S&P
 500
 just
 hit


676.


We're
 talking
 about
 new
 all-time
 highs


in
 the
 pre-market
 type
 of
 green.
 Uh
 it's


because
 of
 CPI,
 which
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


lie,
 I
 forgot
 was
 coming
 out
 this


morning.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys


also
 probably
 forgot
 that
 it
 was
 coming


out
 this
 morning,
 but
 it
 did.
 And
 uh
 it


was
 better
 than
 expected.
 It
 was
 better


than
 expected.
 CPI
 comes
 in
 at
 3%
 versus


3.1%.


This
 is
 the
 highest
 read
 since
 January.


August
 was
 at
 2.9.
 So,
 we
 are
 up
 a


little
 bit
 month
 over
 month,
 but
 it's


lower
 than
 expectations.
 It
 came
 in


lower
 than
 expectations.
 Um,


this
 kind
 of
 changes
 a
 lot
 of
 dynamics.


There
 is
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 in
 terms
 of


how
 the
 macro
 reacts
 to
 this.
 Obviously,


uh,
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 really
 excited


about
 this
 and
 you're
 seeing
 this
 in


equity
 prices.
 I
 mean,
 Nvidia
 184.
 Tesla


still
 holding
 447.
 Palinger
 trying
 to


break
 184.
 Grab
 Grab
 was
 at
 548
 3
 days


ago,
 it's
 at
 586.
 Robin
 Hood
 139
 trying


to
 break
 140.
 Amazon
 221.
 Meta
 breaking


through
 740.
 Salesforce
 up
 another
 1%.


We
 got
 everything
 across
 board.


Ethereum,
 it
 was
 just
 at
 4,000
 before
 I


went
 live.
 Now
 it's
 just
 below
 4,000.


But
 still
 39.64.
 Bitcoin
 right
 here
 at


111.
 BMR
 was
 breaking
 52.
 I
 mean,
 you


are
 seeing
 a
 decent
 amount
 of


excitement.
 We'll
 see
 if
 this
 gets
 faded


when
 the
 market
 opens
 or
 if
 this
 has


some
 legs
 to
 continue.
 Um,
 but
 as
 of


now,
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 market
 is
 happy


with
 the
 CPI.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 coverage
 on
 this
 and
 then
 we'll


talk
 about
 some
 more
 of
 these


implications.
 Coming
 out
 September
 read


on
 the
 consumer
 price
 index.
 Headline


number
 up
 3/10enth
 cooler
 than
 both
 rear


view
 mirror
 and
 what
 we're
 expecting.


And
 if
 we
 look
 at
 the
 stripping
 out
 of


food
 and
 energy
 known
 as
 core,
 it
 comes


in
 also
 a
 bit
 less
 than
 expected,
 up


210.
 We're
 expecting
 up
 3/10.
 Our
 last


look
 was
 up
 3/10.
 Here's
 the
 money
 ball


numbers
 year-over-year,
 3%.
 And
 even


though
 it's
 less
 than
 the
 3.1
 we're


expecting,
 it's
 hotter
 than
 2.9.
 And


after
 all,
 it's
 got
 a
 three
 handle.
 And


if
 we
 look
 at
 CPI
 year-over-year,
 X
 food


and
 energy,
 it
 also
 comes
 in
 at
 3%.
 We


are
 also
 expecting
 3.1,
 but
 last
 look


was
 3.1,
 so
 it
 cooled
 a
 bit.
 So,
 we're


seeing
 interest
 rates
 move
 down
 and


stocks
 move
 up.
 You
 may
 be
 asking
 why.


The
 easy
 answer,
 because
 it's
 less
 than


expectations.
 Is
 it
 less
 than
 the
 Fed's


target
 of
 2%?
 No.
 Which
 in
 my
 opinion,


that
 fact
 will
 rise
 above
 all
 the
 issues


of
 the
 day
 at
 some
 point,
 but
 yes,
 we
 do


see
 rates
 moving
 a
 bit
 lower.


Ultimately,
 this
 is
 a
 very
 important


number
 because
 the
 market
 without
 any


data
 points
 has
 been
 pretty
 much
 viewed


on
 the
 notion
 that
 the
 labor
 market
 is


slowing
 and
 that
 really
 is
 a
 good
 thing


if
 you're
 looking
 for
 the
 Fed
 uh
 cycle


to
 continue
 its
 rate
 cuts.
 Now,
 how
 does


this
 figure
 in?
 I
 can't
 speak
 for
 Fed


officials,
 but
 if
 you
 really
 have
 an


agnostic
 view
 and
 you
 look
 at
 these


numbers,
 the
 last
 thing
 you
 think
 about


is
 we're
 closing
 in
 on
 the
 Fed's
 target.


Joe
 and
 the
 gang,
 back
 to
 you.


>> Now,
 that
 that
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 cutting
 rates.


Uh
 I
 mean,
 the
 probabilities
 for
 cutting


continue
 to
 be
 pretty
 high,
 still
 at


98.9%.


Uh
 they
 might
 not
 cut
 three
 times
 as


some
 people
 are
 saying
 towards
 the
 end


of
 the
 year,
 like
 an
 additional
 three


times
 from
 the
 first
 time
 we
 already


cut,
 but
 we
 still
 might
 get
 those
 two


cuts
 that
 people
 are
 looking
 for.
 In


terms
 of
 the
 summary
 of
 this,
 energy,


folks,
 was
 the
 biggest
 factor.
 The
 index


for
 gasoline
 rose
 4.1%
 in
 September,
 was


the
 largest
 factor
 of
 all
 the
 monthly


items
 increased.
 Energy
 was
 up
 1.5


overall.
 Food
 was
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 month
 uh


and
 home
 index
 increased.1%.


Uh
 indexes
 that
 increased
 over
 the
 month


include
 shelter,
 airline
 fairs,


recreation,
 household
 furnishings
 and


operations
 and
 apparel.
 Apparel
 was
 one


of
 the
 largest
 ones.
 The
 indices
 for


motor
 vehicle
 insurance,
 used
 cars
 and


trucks
 and
 communication
 were
 among
 the


few
 that
 actually
 decreased.
 Market


loves
 it.
 Market
 absolutely
 loves
 it


right
 now.
 Uh
 AMD
 all-time
 highs.
 There


you
 go.
 in
 the
 pre-market
 24294.


SoFi
 trying
 to
 break
 29.
 Google
 at
 256.


You
 got
 Rocket
 Lab
 trying
 to
 potentially


get
 back
 into
 the
 70s.
 Dell's
 up
 3%.


SMCI
 which
 took
 a
 nasty
 9%
 beating.


That's
 getting
 a
 2%
 reversal.
 Apple
 261.


ELF's
 up
 1.58%.
 I
 ran
 I
 think
 was


hitting
 60.
 I
 ran
 61.


And
 that
 means
 the
 other
 ones
 are


probably
 going
 with
 it.
 If
 we
 look
 at


Cipher,
 that's
 up
 8%.
 Clean
 Spark's
 up


six.
 Wolves
 up
 six.
 Bit
 Farm's
 up
 12.


Hives
 ups
 five.
 Marathon's
 up
 three.


Riot
 four.
 Galaxy
 is
 up
 three.
 Broadcom,


that
 one
 I
 saw
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 as


well.
 That
 was
 green.
 And
 that's
 up


2.84%.
 All right.
 So,
 let
 me
 ask
 a


question
 to
 everybody
 because
 this
 is


something
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 in
 the


morning
 before
 I
 got
 the
 CPI
 data.
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 this
 really
 for
 the
 past


couple
 of
 days
 now.
 Uh,
 and
 the
 CPI
 data


might
 be
 potentially
 kind
 of
 confirming


it.
 So
 on
 Monday
 we
 had
 let's
 call
 it


well
 realistically
 this
 started
 two


weeks
 ago.
 This
 started
 October
 10th.
 By


the
 way
 the
 draw
 down
 has
 been
 so
 bad


over
 the
 p
 you
 know
 we're
 we
 you
 know


we're
 down
 one
 or
 two%
 away
 from
 alltime


highs
 which
 is
 quote
 unquote
 so
 bad.


Renaissance
 Technologies
 the
 the
 massive


hedge
 fund
 they
 took
 a
 $3
 billion
 loss


on
 paper
 over
 the
 past
 14
 days
 ever


since
 the
 whole
 Trump
 China
 stuff


started
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 So,


their
 gains
 for
 the
 year
 have
 gone
 to


zero
 and
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 up
 12%.
 Now,


they'll
 probably
 recover
 that
 over
 the


next
 couple
 of
 days,
 but
 it
 just
 goes
 to


show
 how
 much
 money
 was
 in
 the
 system


that
 ended
 up
 getting
 wiped
 out
 from


some
 of
 these
 funds
 because
 they
 were


levered
 long
 on
 some
 of
 these
 names.
 And


then
 when
 you
 take
 a
 3%
 draw
 down,
 it


really
 takes
 a
 hit.
 So,
 the
 the
 the
 3%


draw
 down
 on
 the
 S&P
 ended
 up
 creating
 a


massive
 high
 beta
 draw
 down,
 momentum


stock
 draw
 down,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 it.
 the
 Oaklows
 of
 the
 world,


nuclear
 stocks,
 quantum
 stocks,
 all
 that


stuff
 really
 took
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 beating


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 Here's


the
 question
 to
 everybody
 in
 the
 chat.


Now
 that
 we
 have
 CPI
 data
 and
 we
 have


some
 pretty
 good
 earnings
 data
 that


we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days


and
 next
 week
 will
 be
 the
 big
 one
 for


earnings.
 Is
 the
 draw
 down
 in
 momentum


stocks
 done?
 That
 is
 my
 question.
 Is
 the


draw
 down
 in
 momentum
 stocks
 done?
 Do


you
 think
 that
 is
 the
 case?


Because
 if
 it
 is
 the
 case,
 then


obviously
 anyone
 who
 has
 bought
 the
 dip


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days
 in
 anything,


no matter
 what
 the
 stock
 is,
 I
 mean,
 you


can
 see
 everything
 is
 up
 right
 now.
 HIMS


is
 up,
 AS,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 Uber,
 etc.,


you
 know,
 you're
 green.
 Now,
 look,
 AS


maybe
 is
 not
 going
 back
 to
 102
 anytime


soon,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 going


back
 down
 to
 36.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 the


same
 thing
 for
 like
 an
 Oaklow.
 Maybe


it's
 not
 going
 back
 to
 195
 anytime
 soon,


but
 it
 might
 not
 be
 going
 back
 to
 85


either.
 So,
 it
 chills
 out
 in
 the
 130s,


140s
 type
 of
 range.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we


have
 the
 ability
 to
 have
 those
 momentum


stocks
 make
 new
 all-time
 highs
 like
 the


S&P
 500
 is
 making
 right
 now.
 And
 that's


probably
 healthy
 because
 those
 stocks


likely
 didn't
 deserve
 to
 be
 at
 those


types
 of
 levels,
 at least
 not
 yet.
 But


that
 also
 means
 that
 if
 the
 S&P's
 500
 is


at
 alltime
 highs
 and
 we've
 basically


flushed
 out
 all
 of
 the
 the
 froth
 that


was
 there,
 maybe
 not
 all
 of
 it,
 but
 to


an
 extent
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 it,
 then


maybe
 this
 is
 creating
 the
 next
 leg
 up


to
 go
 higher.
 The
 earnings
 haven't
 come


out
 yet.
 That's
 a
 good
 point.
 Their


earnings
 haven't
 come
 out
 yet,
 and


that's
 another
 question
 uh
 on
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 those


names.
 But
 the
 sort
 of
 structural
 draw


down
 that
 we
 saw
 across
 a
 lot
 of
 names


that
 just
 took
 a
 beating
 and
 again
 every


name
 took
 a
 beating,
 right?
 Pounder
 took


a
 beating.
 It
 got
 to
 169.
 Hood
 got
 to


120.
 Those
 those
 names
 took
 a
 beating.


Grab
 took
 a
 beating.
 Soi
 got
 to
 25.


Those
 they
 took
 a
 beating
 but
 they


didn't
 take
 as
 big
 of
 a
 beating
 as
 some


of
 those
 other
 names.
 But
 if
 everything


is
 kind
 of
 back
 to
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


a
 stabilized
 perspective
 on
 this,
 maybe


that
 beating
 theoretically


might
 not
 be
 that
 crazy.
 Funstrat
 says


there
 could
 be
 a
 correction
 in
 the
 next


few
 weeks.
 I
 haven't
 seen
 their


technical
 analysis
 from
 Mark
 Newton.


I'll
 try
 to
 pull
 up
 what
 he
 said.
 Uh
 but


maybe
 so
 that
 that's
 why
 I'm
 asking
 the


question
 because
 could
 this
 be
 setting


up
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 another
 draw


down
 because
 we
 don't
 really
 have


anything
 fundamental.
 Government's
 still


shut
 down,
 etc.
 to
 say
 that
 we're
 out
 of


basically
 I'm
 trying
 to
 say
 are
 we
 out


of
 the
 woods?
 Are
 we
 out
 of
 the
 woods


for
 the
 volatility
 of
 October?
 It's
 been


a
 very
 choppy
 October.
 Could
 we


potentially
 end
 out
 October
 green?


Which,
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 October
 ended


today,
 we
 would
 be
 green.
 S&P's
 at
 all


time
 highs.
 We
 would
 be
 green.
 That
 is


what
 I'm
 curious
 to
 see
 what
 people
 are


thinking.


But
 it
 definitely
 has
 been
 a
 a
 past
 two


crazy
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 it
 took
 a
 beating
 as


a
 dude.
 I
 was
 down
 like
 130
 grand
 three


days
 ago.
 I
 think
 right
 now,
 let's
 open


up
 the
 port.
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 it
 all


day
 all old
 morning.


It's
 up
 134
 that
 like
 it's
 literally,


you
 know,
 it's
 reversing
 almost


everything
 that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 days.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 that's
 very


similar
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 as
 well.
 So


that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 reason
 for
 this


question.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


coverage
 right
 here
 on
 CPI
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 into
 some
 of the
 other
 macro


data
 that
 we
 have
 from
 from
 last
 night.


What
 you
 were
 expecting,
 is
 it
 not?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 even
 a
 little
 bit
 softer.
 Um,


and
 so
 that
 that's
 great
 news
 for
 the


Fed
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 their
 ability
 to
 to


cut
 in
 October,
 which
 didn't
 really
 seem


that
 much
 in
 doubt,
 but
 also
 to
 follow


the
 dot
 plot
 in
 December.
 uh
 you've
 had


some
 people
 on
 the
 Fed
 uh
 who
 are
 on
 the


more
 hawkish
 side
 of
 things
 who've
 since


September
 pushed
 back
 on
 what
 what


seemed
 like
 a
 dove
 a
 shift
 and
 of
 course


we
 haven't
 gotten
 very
 much
 data
 since


then
 of
 course
 but
 what
 little
 data
 we


do
 have
 now
 from
 from
 just
 now
 does


appear
 to
 make
 it
 seem
 like
 inflation


fears
 are
 at
 least
 a
 little
 bit
 uh
 were


a
 little
 bit
 uh
 too
 high
 given
 given


what
 we're
 getting
 in
 so
 far


>> so
 um
 the
 market
 has
 been
 strong
 Michael


and
 and
 Rick
 makes
 that
 point
 any
 AI
 uh


tailwind
 that
 that
 makes
 it
 less
 uh


fundamentally
 based
 than
 than
 we
 think.


>> No,
 I
 think
 listen
 fundamentals
 Joe
 are


pretty
 strong
 right
 now.
 I
 there's
 no


doubt
 about
 it.
 You
 know,
 the
 economy
 is


not
 weak
 per
 se.
 I
 mean,
 you've
 had


pockets
 of
 weakening.
 I
 really
 do


believe
 we're
 in
 a
 K-shaped
 economy


where
 the
 lower
 end
 is
 maybe
 not
 quite


as
 strong
 as
 the
 higher
 end.
 Um
 today's


number
 for
 me
 is
 actually
 about


broadening
 more
 than
 it
 is
 about
 AI.


Although
 probably
 the
 first
 step
 forward


is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 about
 AI
 and
 some
 of


the
 momentum
 plays
 just
 because
 they
 are


juiced
 by
 liquidity
 and
 we
 do
 have
 easy


financial
 conditions
 and
 this
 will
 sort


of
 pretend
 more
 of
 that
 but
 uh
 you
 know


I
 think
 you
 can
 make
 an
 argument
 that


you
 get
 some
 broadening
 here
 and
 it's


not
 just
 about
 AI


>> and
 that
 broadening
 obviously
 would
 be


very
 healthy.
 Having
 a
 CPI
 come
 in


better
 than
 expected
 also
 would
 be


healthy.
 57%
 of
 you
 say
 yes
 the
 momentum


draw
 down
 is
 over.
 50%
 of
 you
 say
 yes,


the
 momentum
 draw
 down
 is
 over.
 I
 mean,


look,
 the
 way
 some
 of
 these
 stock
 prices


are
 reacting
 to
 CPI,
 which
 by
 like
 it's


good
 CPI,
 but
 I
 I
 I
 mean,
 I've
 covered


CPI
 for
 the
 past
 two
 years.
 This
 is
 not


a
 phenomenal
 reading
 of
 CPI.
 I
 mean,


it's
 the
 highest
 read
 since
 January.


It's
 better
 than
 expectations,
 and
 in


the
 stock
 market,
 perception
 is
 more


important
 than
 reality
 most
 of
 the
 time,


but
 but
 it's
 still
 a
 still
 an
 aggressive


read.
 I
 just
 think
 because
 we've
 got
 so


little
 data
 and
 the
 market
 was
 so
 happy


to
 finally
 get
 some
 piece
 of
 tangible


data
 that
 could
 justify
 like
 that


inflation
 is
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 expected.


That's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 this


momentum
 right
 here
 across
 the
 entire


board.
 Now,
 we're
 going to
 see
 a
 9:30.


Let's
 do
 another
 poll
 right
 here.
 Do
 you


think
 we
 end
 up
 green
 or
 red
 for
 the


day?
 It
 would
 be
 a
 pretty
 big
 whipsaw
 if


we
 end
 up
 actually
 going
 red
 on
 this.


Um,


but
 would
 be
 curious
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 how


people
 think


this
 day
 would
 end
 out.
 All right,
 so


let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 other
 stuff


that
 happened
 overnight.
 So,
 uh,
 the
 CPI


story
 took
 away
 from
 the
 most
 important


story
 that
 happened
 last
 night,
 which
 I


don't
 even
 know
 if
 it's
 really
 that
 in


supportive.
 I
 mean,
 important
 because
 I


don't
 know if
 the
 market
 cares,
 but


Trump
 tweeted
 at
 about
 10
 p.m.
 Uh,
 the


the
 Ronald
 Reagan
 Foundation
 has
 just


announced
 that
 Canada
 has
 fraudulently


used
 an
 advertisement,
 which
 is
 fake,


featuring
 Ronald
 Reagan
 speaking


negatively
 about
 tariffs.
 The
 ad
 was
 for


$75,000.
 The
 only
 reason
 they
 did
 this


is
 to
 interfere
 with
 the
 decision
 of
 the


US
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 other
 courts.


Tariffs
 are
 very
 important
 to
 the


national
 security
 of
 the
 United
 States.


Based
 on
 their
 egregious
 behavior,
 old


trade
 negotiations
 with
 Canada
 are


hereby
 terminated.


Thank
 you
 for
 your
 attention
 to
 this


matter.
 So,
 this
 came
 out
 at
 10:40
 and


immediately
 I
 did
 what
 everyone
 else


did,
 which
 is
 you
 went
 to
 your
 brokerage


app
 and
 you
 looked
 to
 see
 like
 how
 bad


is
 the
 carnage
 and
 like
 it
 was
 nothing.


No
 one
 cared.


No
 one
 freaking
 car.
 If
 that
 country


that
 started
 with
 a
 C
 was
 China
 instead


of
 Canada,
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 CPI
 would


have
 been
 able
 to
 save
 us
 aside.


Remember,
 the
 whole
 reason
 this
 draw


down
 started
 two
 weeks
 ago
 on
 October


10th
 is
 because
 of
 a
 tweet
 about
 China.


So,
 it's
 quite
 incredible.
 It's
 almost


like
 the
 market
 doesn't
 care
 at
 all


about
 Canada.
 Also,
 do
 we
 not
 think
 Mark


Carney
 is
 going
 to
 call
 up
 Trump
 and
 be


like,
 "Yo,
 I'm
 sorry
 you
 got
 offended
 by


the
 bubble.
 Let's
 like,
 you
 know,
 they


were
 just
 laughing
 with
 each
 other.
 What


was
 it
 a
 week
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 in
 the
 Oval


Office?"
 So,
 like
 I
 I
 really
 don't
 think


that
 Mark
 thought
 this
 was
 serious
 and


as
 a
 result,
 that's
 why
 he
 had
 some
 of


the
 pain.
 This
 is
 the
 ad
 for
 those
 that


wanted
 some
 context
 that
 Trump
 was
 so


pissed
 off
 about.


>> When
 someone
 says,
 "Let's
 impose
 tariffs


on
 foreign
 imports,"
 it
 looks
 like


they're
 doing
 the
 patriotic
 thing
 by


protecting
 American
 products
 and
 jobs.


And
 sometimes
 for
 a
 short
 while
 it


works,
 but
 only
 for
 a
 short
 time.
 But


over
 the
 long
 run,
 such
 trade
 barriers


hurt
 every
 American
 worker
 and
 consumer.


High
 tariffs
 inevitably
 lead
 to


retaliation
 by
 foreign
 countries
 and
 the


triggering
 of
 fierce
 trade
 wars.


Then
 the
 worst
 happens.
 Markets
 shrink


and
 collapse.
 Businesses
 and
 industries


shut
 down
 and
 millions
 of
 people
 lose


their
 jobs.


Throughout
 the
 world,
 there's
 a
 growing


realization
 that
 the
 way
 to
 prosperity


for
 all
 nations
 is
 rejecting


protectionist
 legislation
 and
 promoting


fair
 and
 free
 competition.
 America's


job.


>> All right.


>> And
 growth
 are
 at
 stake.


>> So
 this
 is
 what
 this
 this
 was
 paid
 for


the
 government
 of
 Ontario.
 Obviously


Trump
 was
 pissed
 off
 on
 that.
 He
 thought


it
 lacked
 context,
 was
 fake,
 yada
 yada.


I
 mean,
 and
 that
 was
 enough
 for
 him
 to


create
 that
 tweet.
 And
 again,
 the


markets
 just
 didn't
 react
 to
 it.
 The


markets
 really
 just
 didn't
 react
 to
 it.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 Trump's
 point
 is
 that


it's
 out
 of
 context
 and
 it's
 like
 it's


misinterpreting
 what
 they
 said.
 uh
 and


you
 know
 he
 governs
 policy
 through


through
 tweeting
 and
 so
 that's
 what
 he


said
 yesterday.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 for


investors
 no
 one
 cared
 which
 is
 kind
 of


hilarious
 because
 you
 would
 think
 like


there
 would
 be
 some
 impact
 of
 Trump


saying
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 trade
 with


China.
 All
 negotiations
 are
 quote


unquote
 over.
 But
 the
 market
 was
 just


like
 no
 they're
 not.
 You'll
 be
 back
 to


normal
 in
 a
 couple
 days.
 You'll
 be
 okay.


And
 as
 a
 result
 you
 get
 good
 CPI
 and
 now


we're
 continuing
 to
 go
 green.
 So
 there


you
 go.
 Apploving
 right
 there.
 608


that's
 up
 3%.
 Circle
 up
 2.4.
 Pinterest


is
 up
 2.1.
 The
 Q's
 are
 up
 1%.
 Crowd


Strike
 up
 1%.
 I
 mean,
 today
 if
 if
 a


stock
 is
 red,
 you
 really
 got
 to
 question


why
 the
 hell
 it's
 red.
 Like
 Tesla
 Tesla


just
 had
 earnings,
 so
 I
 mean,
 you
 can


understand
 why
 that,
 but
 Tesla's
 barely


down
 from
 earnings,
 which,
 you
 know,
 is


pretty
 incredible
 given
 the
 earnings


weren't
 amazing.
 I
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 be


remarkable
 to
 see
 all
 this
 go
 to
 the


downside
 and
 have
 a
 little bit
 of
 a


U-turn,
 but
 everything
 and
 it's
 kind
 of


like
 things
 have
 been
 coiled
 up
 a
 little


bit
 as
 well
 that
 things
 have
 wanted
 to


rally.
 They
 needed
 a
 real
 catalyst.
 And


this
 CPI
 news
 could
 be
 the
 reason
 why
 we


are
 getting
 this
 rally.
 Bit
 farms
 is


red.
 Bit
 farms
 was
 just
 green,
 bro.
 It


was
 up
 6%.


No,
 no,
 Bitform
 is
 up
 11%.
 Bit
 forms
 is


green.
 Maybe
 it's
 not
 up
 as
 as
 much
 as


it
 was
 before,
 but
 pretty
 much


everything
 is
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 green.


Also,
 hold
 my
 beer.
 Maybe
 maybe
 Alos
 are


saying
 hold
 my
 beer.
 What
 did
 you
 guys


say
 in
 the
 poll?
 85%
 of
 you
 think
 it


ends
 out
 green.


All right,
 we're
 going
 to
 see,
 dude.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we
 are
 out
 of
 the
 woods.


My
 gut
 wants
 to
 tell
 me
 yes
 because


we're
 almost
 near
 the
 end
 of
 October.


November,
 December
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 better


time
 for
 the
 market.
 Uh,
 money
 market


funds
 added
 even
 more
 money
 yesterday
 on


the
 sidelines.
 Eventually,
 that
 money
 is


going
 to
 come
 out
 and
 that
 money
 is


going
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 an
 opportunity


when
 rates
 come
 down.
 Rates
 are
 ready
 to


come
 down
 in
 less
 than
 10
 days.
 Earnings


so
 far
 have
 been
 good.
 We're
 going to


talk
 about
 earnings
 next
 in
 a
 second.


And
 overall,
 like
 how
 low
 do
 these


stocks
 have
 to
 go?
 I
 mean,
 even
 the
 high


beta
 momentum
 names,
 they've
 already


taken
 all
 of
 them,
 whether
 it's
 Quantum,


Nuclear,
 Rare
 Earth,
 Bitcoin
 miners,


they've
 all
 taken.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 all


still
 down
 even
 after
 they've
 recovered


a
 little
 bit
 over
 the
 past
 48
 hours.


Oaklo
 is
 still
 down
 21%.
 This
 week,
 so


it's
 like,
 does
 it
 really
 need
 to
 go


that
 much
 lower?
 And
 if
 if
 it
 doesn't,


then
 maybe
 that
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 structural


bottom
 we're
 seeing
 across
 the
 board.


And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 we
 might
 be


going
 higher.


We
 might
 be
 going
 higher.
 All
 right,
 so


let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other
 stories


that
 we
 got.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Nebius,
 by
 the


way,
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 I
 almost
 got
 I


almost
 thought
 I
 was
 going to
 get


assigned
 on
 my
 98
 puts
 on
 Wednesday.


That
 was
 a
 great
 day
 for
 anyone
 who


bought
 the
 dip
 across
 the
 entire
 board,


whether
 it
 was
 SoFi,
 Nvidia,
 Nebius,


Core.
 I
 mean,
 Nebius,
 look
 at
 that
 11289


up
 6.3%.
 Which
 which
 gets
 us
 AMD,
 Wow.


244.
 Look
 at
 that
 4%
 move.
 Maybe
 we
 see


Nvidia
 follow
 AMD
 and
 get
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 breakout.
 Remember,
 Nvidia
 was
 195


a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 but
 AMD
 really


outshining
 in
 the
 semises.
 TSM
 back


above
 300.
 TSM
 very
 close,
 ASML


at
 138.
 Okay,
 so
 let's
 have
 this
 uh
 sort


of
 transition
 into
 the
 data
 center


conversation
 because
 this
 is
 the
 other


big
 story
 that
 came
 out
 last
 night
 and


this
 is
 why
 Nebius,
 Cory,
 etc.,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 are
 also
 green.
 Um,


well,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 coming
 into


Oracle.
 Oracle
 completed
 a
 $
 38
 billion


debt
 deal
 to
 finance,
 you
 guessed
 it,


more
 data
 centers.


Um,
 this
 is
 quite
 remarkable.
 23.25


billion
 will
 be
 financed
 for
 a
 data


center
 in
 Texas.
 14.75
 billion
 will
 be


financed
 for
 a
 data
 center
 in
 Wisconsin.


Vantage
 Data
 Centers
 is
 developing
 both


of
 those,
 which
 are
 going to
 be
 used
 by


Oracle
 to
 power
 another
 company
 that
 we


all
 know
 about,
 OpenAI.
 The
 Saudis
 are


getting
 involved
 in
 this.
 The
 Japanese


are
 getting
 involved
 in
 this.
 Uh
 Wells


Fargo,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 JP
 Morgan,
 Black


Rockck,
 all
 your
 typical
 vendors
 that


you
 would
 understand
 as
 like
 critical


parts
 of
 the
 financing
 project
 for
 a
 lot


of
 data
 centers
 that
 have
 been
 very


vocal
 that
 they
 want
 to
 commit
 finance


to
 this
 opportunity.
 They
 are
 part
 of


this.
 Now,
 there's
 a
 bull
 case
 to
 this


and
 there's
 a
 bare
 case
 to
 this.
 And


let's
 do
 the
 bare
 case
 first.
 I
 think


all
 of
 you
 guys
 understand
 the
 bare


case.
 It's
 uh
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the


things
 that's
 kind
 of
 glaring
 you
 right


in
 the
 eye,
 which
 is
 that
 this
 38


billion
 is
 not
 free
 cash
 flow.
 It's
 not


net
 income.
 It's
 not
 operating
 income.


It
 is
 debt.
 It
 is
 debt.
 Oracle
 is
 taking


on
 basically
 $40
 billion
 worth
 of
 debt


likely
 through
 the
 the
 sale
 of
 of


corporate
 bonds.
 Uh
 which
 they
 did
 a


couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 as
 well
 at
 to
 the


tune
 of
 13
 billion.
 And
 they
 were
 paying


six
 and a
 half%
 on
 those
 corporate


bonds.
 And
 so
 in
 layman's
 terms,
 they


are
 getting
 40
 billion.
 They
 are
 saying,


"Hey,
 we'll
 pay
 you
 back
 the
 40
 billion


with
 6%,
 5%,
 7%,
 whatever
 rate
 they're


offering
 to
 the
 debt
 issuers."
 And
 the


debt
 issuers
 are
 happy
 to
 give
 the
 money


because
 they
 believe
 that
 data
 centers


are
 real.
 there's
 going to
 be
 an
 ROI
 on


all
 this
 AI
 capex
 spend
 and
 Oracle
 knows


that
 their
 market
 cap
 is
 likely
 going
 to


go
 much
 higher
 and
 they
 can
 afford
 to


pay
 back
 that
 debt
 eventually
 even
 with


interest
 because
 of
 how
 massive
 the


opportunity
 is
 for
 data
 centers
 and
 I


think
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 major
 reasons
 I


ran
 and
 cipher
 and
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 these


other
 smaller
 names
 Navius
 Coriv
 etc


exploded
 last
 night
 in
 the
 overnight


market
 CPI
 is
 just
 adding
 fuel
 to
 the


fire
 is
 that
 Oracle
 saying
 there
 is
 40


billion
 of
 demand
 and
 this
 is
 just
 for


two
 data
 centers
 in
 two
 different
 states


We're
 talking
 about
 data
 centers
 across


the
 entire
 world.
 Google
 committed
 15


billion
 to
 data
 centers
 in
 India
 on


Monday.


I
 mean
 like
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 demand
 for


this
 product
 is
 insatiable
 which
 is
 the


bull
 case.
 The
 bare
 case
 is
 they're


doing
 it
 through
 debt.
 And
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we
 should
 be
 the
 most
 excited
 about


40
 billion
 being
 financed
 via
 debt


because
 like
 if
 we
 if
 something
 doesn't


go
 as
 planned
 and
 there
 is
 lack
 of
 an


ROI.
 Yeah.
 you
 know
 all
 the
 general
 bare


cases
 around
 data
 centers
 and
 AI
 uh
 you


know
 Oracle
 stuck
 with
 $40
 billion
 in


debt
 which
 is
 not
 the
 best
 idea
 amid
 do


you
 know
 how
 many
 data
 centers
 Grinder


has
 I
 do
 I
 do
 not
 even
 though
 I
 I
 know


I'm
 the
 largest
 shareholder
 of
 of
 that


company
 I
 do
 not
 know
 how
 many
 data


centers
 they
 have
 so
 there
 you
 go
 you're


green
 on
 a
 lot
 of the
 data
 center
 names


because
 of
 this
 news
 on
 Oracle
 I
 mean


look
 I
 think
 it's
 bullish
 obviously


because
 the
 fact
 that
 $40
 billion
 is


willing
 to
 go
 into
 these
 debt
 financing


projects


means
 that
 you
 know
 the
 banks,


institutional
 shareholders,
 investors,


they
 want
 to
 subsidize
 this
 because
 they


believe
 this
 is
 actually
 real
 and
 it's


going
 to
 happen.
 The
 question
 is
 just


you
 know
 over
 time
 is
 the
 debt
 going
 to


be
 a
 burden
 for
 these
 companies
 and
 if


it's
 not
 then
 show
 goes
 on.
 If
 it
 is


then
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 issues.
 Um


the
 Bitcoin
 mining
 data
 center
 companies


are
 up
 because
 Jane
 Street
 just


disclosed
 a
 5%
 stake
 in
 three
 of
 them.


Okay,
 so
 let's
 talk
 about
 this
 real


quick
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 very


important
 for
 people
 to
 understand


what's
 going
 on
 right
 here.
 When
 you
 see


the
 market
 makers
 like
 a
 Jane
 Street
 or


a
 Black
 Rockck
 or
 a
 Citadel
 take
 a
 stake


in
 these
 companies,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 very


cautious
 in
 looking
 at
 what
 you're


reading
 here.
 Jane
 Street
 is
 a
 market


maker.
 They
 operate


essentially
 the
 way
 they
 make
 their


money
 is
 through
 a
 deltaneutral
 option


strategy.
 What
 does
 that
 mean?
 That


means
 they
 are
 selling
 calls
 to
 retail


shareholders.
 retail
 shareholders
 are


buying
 those
 call
 options.
 Jane
 Street


is
 then
 pocketing
 the
 difference
 on
 the


premium,
 which
 is
 pennies
 of
 a
 penny


that
 they're
 trying
 to
 make
 on
 selling


all
 these
 call
 options
 or
 put
 options.


Basically,
 whatever
 route
 the
 the
 an


investor
 wants
 to
 go
 and
 they're
 a


proprietary
 trading
 fund
 that
 makes
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 its
 profit
 from
 market


making
 activity.
 So,
 when
 you
 see
 a
 Jane


Street
 discloses
 a
 5%
 stake
 in
 Cipher,


it's
 not
 because
 they're
 actually


bullish.
 Cipher.
 Black
 Rockck
 owns
 5.7%


of
 Robin.
 Black
 Rockck
 is
 not
 screaming


to
 the
 moon
 that
 they
 love
 Robin
 Hood
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Black
 Black
 Rockck


doesn't
 care
 about
 Robin
 Hood.
 They
 care


that
 if
 they
 own
 those
 shares,
 they're


able
 to
 rent
 out
 those
 shares
 or
 they're


able
 to
 use
 those
 shares
 to
 facilitate


activities
 to
 make
 a
 market.
 So,
 the


headline
 is
 definitely
 pumping
 cipher


over
 the
 past
 24
 hours.
 And
 it's
 not


bearish
 by
 any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination.


It's
 just
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


are
 thinking
 this
 is
 like
 Jane
 Street


says
 we
 we
 take
 I
 mean
 Jane
 Street
 took


a
 7%
 stake
 in
 Open
 Door.
 Open
 door,
 you


know,
 they
 took
 that
 at
 850.
 Open
 Door


is
 down
 to
 seven
 bucks,
 right?
 It's
 like


it's
 it's
 it's
 not
 like
 they
 think
 Open


Door
 is
 going
 to
 $12
 soon.
 That's
 why


they're
 taking
 the
 5%
 they
 can
 get
 that.


No,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 liquidity
 that
 they


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 provide
 because


there's
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 that
 trade
 Open


Door
 and
 Jane
 Street
 makes
 this
 money


off
 selling
 calls
 and
 puts
 and
 options


to
 these
 retail
 shareholders.


So
 yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 people
 should
 be
 overly
 excited


about,
 you
 know,
 this
 was
 I
 remember


this
 was
 back
 in
 uh
 back
 in
 July


overnight,
 but
 this
 is
 the
 same
 Black


Rockck
 took
 like
 a
 5.2%
 stake
 in
 Robin


and
 everyone
 was
 tagging
 like
 oh
 my


goodness,
 this
 is
 so
 it's
 like
 I'm
 like


it
 doesn't
 matter
 like
 Vanguard,
 Black


Rockck,
 Jane
 Street,
 Citadel,
 these


people
 have
 to
 take
 stakes
 in
 all
 these


companies
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


they
 you
 know
 they
 make
 market
 making


activities
 on
 so
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that's


the
 reason
 they're
 up.
 Now
 the


perception
 of
 that
 might
 be
 that
 because


it's
 so
 green
 and
 like
 we
 love
 that


these
 stocks
 are
 getting
 institutional


investors
 that's
 fair
 but
 Bridgewwater


you
 know
 an
 actual
 money
 manager
 that


has
 an
 opinion
 on
 the
 market
 going
 long


on
 these
 names
 a
 Stanley
 Ducken
 Miller


that's
 a
 lot
 different
 than
 a
 market
 so


that's
 the
 only
 difference
 there
 James


Street
 is
 not
 uh
 public
 so
 you
 cannot


buy
 their
 stock
 they
 do
 they
 did
 this


for
 Grab
 they
 did
 this
 for
 Grab
 last


month
 it
 look
 like
 it
 was a
 2.2%
 2%
 they


can
 grab.
 Grab
 is
 down
 for
 the
 month,


right?
 Like
 this
 is
 not
 this
 is
 not
 them


expressing
 any
 point
 of
 view.
 They


they're
 are
 delta
 neutral.
 They
 don't


care.
 They
 just
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make


money
 off
 the
 premiums
 and
 you
 know
 they


need
 to
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 shares
 to
 be
 able


to
 do
 that.
 Think
 of
 it
 like
 yourself.


If
 you
 buy
 a
 100,000
 shares
 of
 or
 of
 of


any
 stock,
 right?
 If
 you
 buy
 10,000


shares
 of
 Bit
 Farms
 or
 10,000
 shares
 of


Rivian
 or
 3,000
 shares
 of
 Cipher
 just


because
 you
 want
 to
 sell
 calls
 and
 milk


the
 premium,
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 doing


that
 with
 BMR,
 then
 you're
 basically
 a


small
 little
 market
 maker.
 They're
 just


doing
 it
 at
 a,
 you
 know,
 much
 higher


scale.
 BMR,
 by
 the
 way,
 51.24.


That
 is
 also
 green.
 The
 Q's
 are
 up


almost
 1%.
 NASDAQ
 really
 getting
 some.


Wow.
 616.
 I
 think
 that's
 alltime
 highs


for
 the
 NASDAQ
 as
 well.
 Basically


all-time
 highs
 for
 the
 NASDAQ
 in
 the


pre-market.
 If
 this
 can
 stick
 when
 the


market
 opens,
 this
 would
 also
 be
 very,


very
 bullish


to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Uh,


APLD,
 is
 that
 moving
 as
 well?
 ALD.
 Yep.


That's
 up
 5%.
 All right.
 All right,
 so


let's
 talk
 about
 earnings
 that
 we
 had


yesterday.
 First
 of
 all,
 Intel,
 massive


earnings.
 This
 stock
 is
 up
 6%.
 I
 feel


like
 this
 was
 such
 a
 layup
 when
 it
 was


$24
 and
 we
 should
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 more


bullish
 on
 it
 because
 Donny
 T,
 you
 know,


Donnie
 T
 gave
 us
 the
 playbook,
 but
 I


missed
 this
 one
 and
 it
 ended
 up
 working


out.
 Now,
 what
 also
 helps
 is
 if
 they
 can


beat
 on
 earnings
 and
 boy
 did
 they
 beat


on
 earnings.
 2,200%


beat.
 2200%


23
 cents
 versus
 1
 cent
 expected.
 Uh,


that'll
 definitely
 get
 the
 stock
 to
 go


up.
 EPS
 is
 up
 150%
 year-over-year.
 The


stock
 is
 up
 more
 than
 90%
 year-to
 date.


13.6
 billion
 in
 revenue
 versus
 13.1


billion.
 They
 beat
 by
 4%.


So,
 this
 is
 very,
 very
 exciting
 to
 see.


Uh,
 yeah,
 only
 2200%.


Which
 is
 what
 you've
 got
 going
 on
 now.


It's
 not
 just
 Intel
 yesterday.
 I
 mean,


pretty
 much
 every
 company


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 line.
 So


you
 got
 Intel
 right
 there
 that
 beat
 by


22
 100%.
 Deckers
 beat
 by
 15%
 on
 EPS.


Pneumont
 beat
 by
 19%.
 Ford
 beat
 by
 25%.


We're
 talking
 about
 freaking
 Ford
 Legacy


Auto
 Company,
 they
 also
 beat
 by
 three


billion
 on
 revenue,
 which
 means
 there


was
 $3
 billion
 worth
 of
 more
 demand
 for


Ford
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 these
 cars.
 Next


Tracker
 beat
 by
 18%.
 Digital
 realy
 beat


by
 510%.
 EPS
 was
 up
 13%
 year-over-year.


I
 think
 the
 core
 argument
 for
 all
 these


companies
 that
 beat
 yesterday
 on


earnings
 and
 you
 know
 the
 majority
 of


companies
 that
 we've
 covered
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks
 have
 really
 beat
 on


that
 top
 line
 and
 even
 if
 they
 came
 in


line
 with
 expectations
 on
 revenue
 most


of
 them
 are
 beating
 on
 the
 top
 line
 is


that
 there
 is
 margin
 efficiency
 that
 is


happening
 across
 the
 board
 and
 this
 is


the
 real
 reason
 to
 be
 bullish
 for
 a


cipher
 or
 INE
 or
 any
 of
 these
 other
 data


center
 plays
 is
 because
 the
 reg
 reason


some
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 beating
 if


it
 is
 because
 of
 AI
 and
 increasing
 their


margins
 that
 goes
 back
 down
 to
 the
 data


centers.
 Like
 if
 these
 companies
 are


utilizing
 artificial
 intelligence,


increasing
 their
 margins,
 that
 means
 you


need
 compute
 in
 order
 to
 keep
 increasing


their
 margins,
 you
 need
 more
 and
 more


demand
 for
 that
 compute.
 Based
 on
 this


Oracle
 deal,
 we're
 seeing
 more
 and
 more


demand.
 And
 then
 these
 smaller


companies,
 Nebas,
 Corey,
 Vyan,
 Cipher,


Galaxy,
 etc.
 They
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 are


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 deals
 because


they
 have
 more
 facilities
 than
 other


people.
 And
 that
 is
 leading
 back
 to
 the


ecosystem
 of
 a
 lot
 of these
 other


companies,
 whether
 it's
 an
 Intel
 or
 a


Realy
 Income
 that
 are
 actually


generating
 EPS
 growth.
 EPS
 growth
 means


that
 they're
 earning
 more
 per
 share.
 If


they're
 earning
 more
 per
 share,
 that


means
 their
 margins
 are
 likely
 going
 up


uh
 against
 expectations
 and
 that
 means


there
 is
 some
 reason
 for
 their
 margins


going
 up
 for
 them
 to
 deliver
 that
 EPS.


By
 the
 way,
 a
 lot
 of these
 companies


don't
 have
 a
 massive
 buyback
 plan


either.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 next
 week,
 you


know,
 the
 Amazon's
 Google.
 Well,
 Amazon


doesn't
 buy
 back,
 but
 Google,
 Meta,
 they


have
 more
 buyback.
 But
 like
 Intel's
 not


buying
 back
 a
 ton
 of
 stock,
 Ford's
 not


buying
 back
 a
 ton
 of
 stock.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 are
 not
 just


artificially
 financially
 engineering


their
 EPS
 to
 go
 up.
 It
 really
 does
 feel


like
 margin
 enhancement
 across
 the


board.
 By
 the
 way,
 a
 lot
 of these


companies
 as
 well,
 Deckers
 is
 a
 consumer


brand.
 They
 sell
 shoes
 to
 people
 that


like
 the
 fact
 that
 people,
 you
 know,


where
 we
 we
 hear
 about
 what's
 going
 on


with
 the
 state
 of
 the
 consumer.
 Uh,
 if


the
 consumer
 is
 able
 to
 buy,
 now
 Deckers


is
 down
 12%.
 So,
 the
 stock
 is
 not


necessarily
 reacting
 as
 positively,
 but


if
 the
 consumer
 is
 still
 able
 to
 buy


shoes
 at
 the
 level
 at
 which
 they're


buying
 them,
 that's
 bullish.
 Um,
 Ford,


it's
 a
 consumer
 brand.
 people
 are
 buying


cars
 and
 if
 they're
 buying
 it
 at
 the


level
 that
 is
 way
 ahead
 of
 expectations,


three
 billion
 more
 than
 expected,
 again


that
 feels
 bullish.
 And
 so
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 conflicting
 data
 here
 because
 there's


tons
 and
 tons
 of
 data
 we
 looked
 at
 on


why
 the
 consumer
 is
 struggling,
 private


credit,
 auto
 delinquencies,
 credit
 card


loans,
 etc.
 But
 then
 you
 look
 at
 these


earnings
 and
 unless
 these
 numbers
 are


fake,
 if
 more
 and
 more
 people
 are
 buying


shoes
 and
 jeans
 with
 Levis's
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago
 and
 cars
 with
 Ford,


I
 mean,
 maybe
 the
 consumer
 is
 not


necessarily
 in
 that
 bad
 of
 a
 place,


especially
 with
 CPI
 starting
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 lower
 than
 expected.
 You


know,
 maybe
 inflation
 is
 not
 eating
 them


up
 as
 much
 as
 people
 thought.
 As
 well,


they're
 all
 buying
 on
 credit.
 It's
 all


doom
 spending.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 that
 that


is
 one
 theory
 and
 maybe
 that's
 maybe


that's
 possible
 that
 all
 of
 them
 are,


you
 know,
 just
 taking
 out
 loans
 for
 all


this
 stuff
 and
 that
 could
 come
 back
 to


hurt
 people.
 But
 if
 that's
 not
 AMD
 right


there,
 243,


then
 maybe
 it's
 not
 horrible.


Maybe
 it's
 not
 horrible.
 They
 are
 buying


cars
 but
 behind
 on
 their
 payments.
 Yeah.


I
 mean,
 and
 that
 is
 the
 that
 is
 the


contradiction,
 right?
 Like
 like
 we
 saw


the
 chart
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 that
 they


are
 uh
 auto
 delinquencies,
 not
 auto


delinquencies,
 but
 people
 who
 are
 late


on
 their
 payments
 by
 over
 60
 days
 has


doubled
 in
 the
 past
 five
 years.


So
 it's
 like
 okay
 for
 it's
 selling
 more


cars
 but
 if
 the
 people
 that
 are
 buying


it
 aren't
 making
 their
 payments
 that
 is


the
 conundrum
 that
 we
 have
 to
 navigate


with
 and
 maybe
 that
 comes
 to
 bite


everyone
 back
 in
 the
 ass
 and
 that
 ends


up
 hurting
 the
 entire
 economy
 or
 you


know
 that
 is
 a
 subse
 section
 of
 the


consumer
 that
 might
 not
 have
 the
 biggest


impact.
 So
 we
 got
 to
 see
 we
 got
 to
 see


so
 remember
 how
 I
 said
 if
 your
 stock
 is


red
 right
 now
 then
 something
 is
 deeply


wrong.
 Uh
 well,
 one
 of
 the
 companies


that's
 red
 even
 after
 this
 bullish
 CPI


uh
 is
 Snapchat.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 because


of
 this
 headline
 that
 we're
 seeing
 right


here.
 Snapchat
 is
 in
 talks
 to
 raise
 a


billion
 dollars
 for
 their
 AR
 glasses.


Multiple
 investors
 involved,
 including


Saudi
 Arabia's
 sovereign
 wealth
 fund.


Plan
 is
 to
 move
 specs,
 which
 is
 their


Snapchat
 AR
 glasses,
 into
 a
 new


independent
 subsidiary
 and
 structure
 it


similarly
 to
 Whimo
 and
 Alphabet.


Uh
 this
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 funny.
 This
 was


kind
 of
 funny
 to
 me
 to
 see
 this
 end
 up


playing
 out.
 Uh
 first
 of
 all,
 Snapchat,


you
 know,
 has
 been
 horrible
 to


shareholders.
 They
 haven't
 been
 able
 to


make
 a
 profit.
 Evan
 Spiegel
 really
 has


not
 cared
 about
 any
 meaningful
 form
 of


uh
 shareholder
 value
 creation
 via


buybacks,
 dividends,
 anything.
 And
 now


they
 want
 to
 dilute
 by
 another
 billion


for
 a
 company's
 market
 cap,
 which
 is


only
 13
 billion,
 to
 be
 able
 to


potentially
 try
 to
 get
 some
 more
 money,


not
 through
 free
 cash
 flow,
 but
 through


more
 equity,
 aka
 dilution,
 to
 build
 out


their
 Snapchat
 glasses
 product.


I
 mean,
 again,
 every
 time
 I
 think
 about


taking
 a
 a
 chance
 on
 Snapchat,
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 this
 thing's
 at
 seven
 bucks.
 It


could
 do
 a
 little
 rerating.
 They
 still


have
 750
 million
 monthly
 active
 users."


And
 then
 you
 get
 a
 news
 update
 like
 that


and
 you're
 like,
 this
 is
 why
 it's
 hard


to
 to
 bid
 on
 Snapchat.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Snapchat
 still
 red


right
 there.
 And
 ultimately
 they
 might


be
 taking
 on
 some
 more
 debt
 or
 issuing


more
 equity
 to
 be
 able
 to
 raise
 another


billion
 dollar
 right
 here.
 Tesla
 right


here
 at
 447.
 S&P
 look
 at
 that
 676


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 We
 are
 continuing
 to


be
 green.
 Jerome
 Pal
 is
 not
 talking


today
 to
 my
 understanding.
 I
 don't


believe
 that
 JPAL
 is
 having
 any
 major


conversation
 today.


Um,


but
 I
 think
 the
 Fed
 is
 in
 a
 quiet
 period


as
 well
 because
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 uh


we're
 going to
 have
 the
 FOMC
 meeting


coming
 out
 next
 week
 along
 with
 SOFI


earnings
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


important
 as
 well.
 All right,
 so
 that's


what
 we
 have
 there
 across
 the
 board
 on


CPI.
 In
 terms
 of
 government
 shutdown,
 we


don't
 have
 any
 major
 updates
 outside
 of


that.
 The
 government
 continues
 to
 be


shut
 down.
 Again,
 Trump
 blamed
 the


Democrats
 yesterday.
 Bernie
 Sander


blamed
 the
 Republicans.
 So
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 back
 and
 forth
 and
 maybe
 next


week
 we'll
 get
 some
 level
 of
 resolution.


Kevin
 Hassid
 did
 say
 he
 thought
 it
 could


get
 resolved
 this
 week.
 Unfortunately,


that's
 not
 necessarily
 what
 we're
 seeing


across
 the
 board.
 These
 are
 the
 CPI


numbers
 for
 those
 that
 missed
 it.
 Again,


we
 came
 in
 a
 bit
 better
 than
 expected.


That's
 what
 really
 got
 the
 market
 to
 get


some
 love.
 At
 9:30,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


how
 much
 the
 market
 continues
 to
 believe


that
 CPI
 is
 in
 the
 right
 spot.


Um,
 and
 it
 is
 the
 highest
 rate
 since


January,
 but
 at least
 it's
 better
 than


from
 before,
 which
 is
 important.
 Crypto.


Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about


crypto.
 So,
 we
 had
 some
 big
 updates


today
 in
 the
 world
 of
 crypto
 that


actually
 potentially
 were
 the
 reasons


why
 Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin
 broke
 out
 a


little
 bit
 in
 the
 morning.
 Um,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this,
 folks.
 JP
 Morgan
 as
 for


Bloomberg
 will
 allow
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 as
 collateral


if
 you
 now
 want
 to
 take
 out
 a
 loan
 or
 if


you
 want
 to
 finance
 an
 opportunity.
 JP


Morgan
 plans
 to
 allow
 institutional


clients
 to
 use
 their
 holdings
 of
 Bitcoin


and
 Ether
 as
 collateral
 for
 loans
 by
 the


end
 of the
 year
 and
 a
 significant


deepening
 of
 Wall
 Street's
 crypto


integration.
 The
 program
 offered


globally
 will
 rely
 on
 a
 third-party


custodian
 to
 safeguard
 the
 pledge


tokens.
 According
 to
 people
 familiar


with
 the
 matter,
 it
 builds
 on
 JP


Morgan's
 earlier
 move
 to
 accept
 crypto


linked
 ETFs
 as
 collateral.
 JP
 Morgan


declined
 to
 comment,
 but
 Bloomberg
 is


reporting
 that
 this
 is
 happening.
 How


many
 people
 think
 this
 is
 a
 good
 idea


for
 institutional
 investors?
 They
 didn't


notice.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they
 didn't
 say


retail
 investors
 yet,
 but
 they
 did
 say


institutional
 clients
 that
 probably
 have


significant
 stakes
 in
 like
 a
 Black


Rockck
 ETF
 or
 an
 Ether
 ETF
 or
 something


as
 collateral.


Will
 they
 accept
 Barcoin?
 Yeah.
 if
 they


accept
 Farcoin
 that,
 you
 know,
 that


would
 definitely
 help
 uh
 collateralize


some
 loans
 that
 people
 want
 to
 get.
 But


look,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 bullish
 for
 the


broader
 industry.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you
 have


the
 most
 important
 consumer
 finance


companies
 coming
 out
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,


we
 are
 ready
 to
 take
 uh
 your
 Bitcoin
 as


collateral
 before
 we
 give
 you
 a
 loan,
 it


only
 institutionalizes
 and
 legitimize


bit
 Bitcoin
 and
 all
 these
 other
 assasses


even
 more."


And
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 bullish.
 Now,
 if


Bitcoin
 were
 to
 collapse,
 that
 would


suck
 if
 either
 like
 because
 then,
 you


know,
 they're
 holding
 the
 bag.
 But
 then


you
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 why
 is
 a
 JP


Morgan
 even
 thinking
 of
 allowing
 their


collateral
 to
 be
 at
 such
 risk
 to
 going


away?
 Like
 if
 you
 came
 to
 JP
 Morgan
 and


said,
 "Hey,
 I
 have
 10,000
 shares
 of


Apple
 stock.
 Can
 I
 get
 a
 loan?"
 I
 mean,


you're
 probably
 gonna
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 take
 you
 seriously,
 right?


Because
 they're
 like, "Okay,
 Apple


Apple's
 probably
 not
 going
 away
 anytime


soon.
 Maybe
 it
 has
 a
 bit
 of a
 draw
 down,


but
 we
 can
 take
 the
 risk
 on
 giving
 you


the
 loan
 because
 even
 if
 there
 is
 a
 draw


down,
 we
 know
 that
 Apple
 will
 come
 back


and
 it'll
 be
 okay."
 That's
 the
 entire


concept
 of
 margin,
 right?
 If
 you
 own


really
 safe
 stocks
 in
 your
 brokerage


like
 Apple,
 Google,
 you're
 going to
 get


more
 margin.
 If
 you
 own
 really
 risky


stocks,
 high
 beta
 stocks,
 they're
 not


going
 to
 give
 you
 as
 much
 money
 because


they're
 afraid
 that
 those
 stocks
 could


end
 up
 tanking.
 It's
 almost
 like
 JP


Morgan's
 admitting,
 "We're
 not
 that


afraid
 of
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 tanking.


And
 if
 they
 do
 tank,
 we
 would
 probably


buy
 the
 dip
 and
 we
 think
 it'll


eventually
 come
 back.
 So,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 margin
 call
 unless


things
 get
 like
 really
 really
 bad.
 But


there's
 safeguards
 in
 place
 to


necessarily
 deal
 with
 that."


Yeah.
 And
 it
 it's
 also
 funny
 because
 as


as
 Cactus
 says
 right
 there,
 Jamie


Diamond
 speaks
 very
 negatively
 about


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum,
 but
 then
 what
 his


firm
 is
 doing
 is
 the
 exact
 opposite.
 And


then
 if
 we
 go
 deeper
 into
 Ethereum,
 this


came
 out
 yesterday.
 Robin
 Hood
 has
 now


brought
 on
 493
 assets
 on
 chain,


including
 stocks,
 ETF,
 crypto
 ETFs,


commodities,
 US
 treasuries,
 and
 private


equities.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 not


available
 to
 people
 in
 the
 United
 States


because
 tokenization
 isn't
 necessarily


um
 available
 through
 Robin
 Hood
 in
 the


States.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 more
 so
 being


done
 in
 in
 Europe
 right
 now.
 But
 it


seems
 like
 it's
 happening.
 And
 you
 know,


the
 exciting
 thing
 about
 this
 and
 how


it's
 playing
 out
 is
 Vlad
 was
 tweeting
 a


lot
 last
 night
 basically
 saying
 that


tokenization
 is
 beginning
 to
 eat
 the


entire
 financial
 system.
 And
 when
 people


asked
 him,
 what
 is
 the
 next
 big
 asset
 to


tokenize,


he
 ended
 up
 saying


real
 estate,
 which
 begs
 the
 question
 for


a
 lot
 of
 the
 bulls
 in
 another
 stock
 that


is
 called
 Open
 Door.
 I
 mean,
 is
 there
 a


world,
 that's
 the
 first
 place
 my
 mind


went
 to.
 Is
 there
 a
 world
 where
 Vlad


says,
 "Hey,
 Open
 Door,
 you've
 got
 a
 ton


of
 inventory.
 What
 if
 we
 could
 tokenize


all
 those
 homes
 and
 make
 them
 tradable


on
 Robin
 Hood's
 blockchain?"
 Now
 again,


I
 don't
 know
 why
 people
 would
 want
 to


trade
 random
 homes.
 You
 would
 want
 to


trade
 like
 stuff
 that
 has
 more
 intrinsic


value.
 Like
 we're
 talking
 about


commercial
 real
 estate.
 We're
 talking


about,
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 talking
 about


some
 random
 home
 in
 Arizona.
 We're


talking
 about
 like
 something
 that
 people


can
 actually
 resonate
 with.
 Whether
 it's


like
 a
 massive
 building
 in
 Manhattan
 or,


you
 know,
 some
 beach
 house
 in
 California


that's
 worth
 $40
 million.
 Like
 there
 I


think
 there's
 a
 different
 way
 to
 think


about
 the
 excitement
 of
 tokenization.


But
 if
 if
 there
 was
 a
 partnership
 like


that,
 I
 mean,
 you
 could
 imagine
 Open


Door
 would
 bring
 out
 a
 new
 vertical
 for


them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 generate
 revenue
 and


that
 would
 be
 massive
 inventory
 for


Robinet
 as
 well.
 Yeah.
 Buying
 fractions


of
 homes,
 all
 that
 stuff.


It's
 just
 the
 majority
 of
 homes
 in
 on


Open
 Doors
 platform.
 It's
 like
 I
 don't


know
 who
 would
 even
 care
 about
 trading


them.
 Um,
 but
 nonetheless,
 it
 it
 is
 one


of
 those
 things
 to
 think
 about
 and


you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 more
 assets
 that


are
 coming
 on
 chain
 for
 Ethereum,
 which


is
 also
 very
 exciting.
 Doesn't
 Hood
 just


become
 an
 insane
 holder
 of
 equities
 and


holding
 houses
 when
 those
 equities
 get


tokenized?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 that
 that's
 the


question,
 right?
 Would
 Hood
 actually


hold
 the
 e
 the
 the
 the
 assets
 or
 would


they
 go
 through
 a
 third
 party
 provider


that
 operates
 essentially
 as
 their


clearing
 house
 to
 custody
 the
 assets


when
 we're
 talking
 about
 real
 world


assets?
 But
 then
 again,
 you
 would
 think


Hood
 kind
 of
 has
 to
 own
 a
 piece
 of
 all


that
 real
 estate
 if
 they're
 tokenizing


it.
 It's
 a
 very
 complicated
 kind
 of
 mind


share
 to
 work
 through.
 But
 and
 you
 know


Vlad
 did
 say
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 in
 an


interview
 in
 Singapore
 that
 it's
 going


to
 take
 some
 time
 for
 this
 to
 play
 out,


but
 he
 does
 think
 the
 technology
 is


there
 and
 as
 long
 as
 the
 technology


keeps
 advancing
 in
 the
 right
 direction,


then


this
 could
 be
 something
 that
 could
 play


out.


Uh
 Essence
 says
 the
 reason
 the
 Bitcoin


collateral
 is
 important
 is
 because
 you


don't
 need
 to
 sell
 to
 utilize
 crypto


profits.
 This
 is
 bullish.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


it's
 like
 a
 stock,
 right?
 If
 you're
 up


big
 on
 Nvidia,
 but
 you
 don't
 want
 to


sell
 your
 Nvidia
 to
 pay
 the
 taxes,
 you


can
 borrow
 against
 it.
 If
 you
 can
 borrow


against
 your
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 on
 an


institutional
 level
 with
 a
 JP
 Morgan,
 it


creates
 first
 of
 all
 more
 loans,
 which


means
 more
 money
 in
 the
 system,
 more


capital
 spending
 activity,
 more
 um


underwriting
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 banks,


which
 is
 bullish
 financials,
 but
 it
 also


means
 that
 those
 assets
 don't
 have
 to
 be


sold.
 I
 mean,
 how
 many
 people
 are


sitting
 on
 massive
 gains
 in
 Tesla
 and


Nvidia
 from
 years
 ago
 that
 instead
 of


selling
 them,
 which
 would
 create
 selling


pressure
 on
 the
 stock,
 they're
 just


saying,
 "I'm
 just
 going
 to
 live
 off
 of


them
 by
 borrowing
 against
 it,
 pay
 the
 5%


interest
 or
 whatever,
 and
 keep
 my
 gains


for
 a
 long
 time."


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 that
 could
 be


what
 h
 what
 happens
 on
 the
 institutional


level
 as
 well.
 Beyond
 Meat,
 are
 we


moving
 on
 that?
 Let's
 see
 how
 some
 of


those
 names
 are
 doing.
 That's
 up.
 Wow.


17%.
 All
 right.
 So
 CPI
 getting
 beyond


meat
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love
 as
 well


and
 that
 one
 getting
 some
 green
 slowed


down
 from


from
 uh
 from
 750.
 Kevin
 Hasset,
 we
 have


some
 quotes
 from
 him.
 Hasset
 says,


"Expect
 Trump
 to
 talk
 to
 Canada
 again
 by


end
 of
 term."


End
 of
 term.


Does
 he
 mean
 the
 presidential
 term
 or


does
 he
 mean
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year?
 End


of
 term.
 Dude,
 imagine
 Trump
 doesn't


talk
 to
 Canada
 for
 the
 next
 four
 years.


I
 don't
 think
 Trump
 is
 that
 pissed
 off


about
 the
 advertisement.
 For
 those
 that


don't
 know
 what
 we're
 talking
 about,
 he


tweeted
 last
 night
 that
 he's
 mad
 that


China
 used
 like
 a
 Ronald
 Reagan
 ad
 out


of
 context
 and
 all
 trade
 negotiations


are
 now
 cancelled
 with
 China.
 I
 think


he's
 saying
 this
 literally
 to
 negotiate.


Like
 we
 know
 Trump
 by
 now.
 Is
 he


actually
 pissed
 off
 about
 China
 to
 s
 or


Canada
 to
 such
 an
 extent


or
 is
 he
 to
 just
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of


potential
 momentum
 in
 in
 some
 of
 these


negotiations
 with
 leverage?


I
 said
 China.
 I
 meant
 to
 say
 Canada.


Meant
 to
 say
 Canada.
 Oh,
 wait,
 wait.
 Did


he
 say
 China
 on
 the
 Let
 me
 see.


Did
 he
 say


Yeah,
 I
 meant
 to
 say
 Canada.
 Hassid


expects
 Trump
 to
 talk
 to
 Canada
 by
 end


of
 term.
 Now,
 if
 Canada
 did
 say
 if
 he
 if


Trump
 did
 if
 if if
 this
 tweet
 was
 about


China,
 I
 think
 we
 would
 be
 in
 a
 worse


situation.
 But
 thankfully,
 it's
 about


Canada,
 which
 is
 why
 it's
 not
 that
 bad.


He's
 mad
 at
 Tanner.
 Yeah,
 Tanner
 did


something
 to
 piss
 him
 off.
 Something.
 Uh


Amit,
 I
 have
 a
 covered
 call
 on
 Tesla
 450


and
 Hood
 140
 expiring
 today.
 Would
 you


roll
 them
 over
 now
 or
 wait
 to
 see
 what


happens
 during
 the
 day?
 I
 would
 give


yourself
 at
 least
 30
 minutes
 to
 see
 what


happens.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 we
 have
 a
 pretty


good
 green
 pre-market.
 We're
 basically


at
 all-time
 highs.
 I
 definitely
 would,


you
 know,
 I
 I
 personally
 would
 wait
 at


least
 30
 minutes
 to
 an
 hour,
 especially


if
 you're
 in
 covered
 calls,
 uh,
 to
 see


if
 the
 market
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 this


momentum.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 not
 just
 at


alltime
 highs,
 folks.
 The
 previous


all-time
 high
 was
 67395.


We
 are
 at
 67640.
 We
 are
 well
 above


673.95.


And
 uh
 so
 if
 we
 were
 to
 have
 a
 complete


meltdown
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market
 opens
 and


everything
 gets
 sold
 off,
 it
 would
 be
 a


bit
 surprising
 to
 me
 that
 that
 would


probably
 help
 some
 of
 your
 covered
 calls


though,
 but
 I
 would
 wait
 a
 little
 bit.


Also,
 your
 Tesla
 450
 and
 your
 Hood
 140


is
 very
 close
 to
 the
 money
 right
 now.
 So


you
 can
 easily
 roll
 those
 without
 having


to
 worry,


but
 I
 would
 want
 to
 see
 what
 the
 trend


ends
 up
 looking
 like.
 So
 about
 80%
 of


you
 say
 we're
 going
 green
 for
 the
 day.


Um,
 it's
 a
 pretty
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 the


most
 green
 premarket
 I've
 seen
 in
 two


weeks.
 Everything
 like
 Lily's
 down,


GameStop's
 down.
 GameStop
 was
 up
 4%


yesterday.
 Snapchat's
 down,
 Fizer's


down.
 The
 VIX,
 look
 at
 that.
 The
 VIX
 is


down
 5%.


VIX
 was
 at
 25
 weeks
 ago.
 It
 was
 at
 22
 on


Wednesday.
 That's
 when
 most
 of
 us,
 I


think,
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of a
 nibble.


Whether
 you
 bought
 anything,
 I
 mean,


you're
 likely
 green
 right
 here.
 Grab
 was


at
 550
 that
 day.
 Pouncer
 was
 at
 169.


Nebius
 was
 at
 94,
 Google
 was
 at
 245,
 AMD


was
 at
 228,
 like
 everything.
 Hood
 was
 at


120,
 Tesla
 got
 to
 415.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 ended
 up
 being
 some
 buy
 the


dip
 opportunities.
 Amazon
 got
 to
 214


and
 they're
 getting
 a
 rebound.


So,
 now
 we
 just
 got
 to
 see
 if
 that


momentum
 has
 the
 has
 the
 ability
 to
 take


over.
 It
 is
 an
 options
 expiry
 day.
 It
 is


a
 Friday,
 so
 you
 potentially
 could
 get


some
 wonky
 behavior
 in
 regards
 to


options
 expiring,
 but
 overall
 CPI
 seems


relatively
 bullish.
 The
 Canada
 trade


escalation
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it
 matters,


at least
 for
 now.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 market


plays
 out.
 Is
 gold
 actually
 down?
 We
 got


30
 seconds.
 Gold
 is
 down.
 Gold
 is


slightly
 down,
 but
 it
 is
 down.
 Maybe
 a


little
 bit
 more
 risk
 on
 as
 gold
 goes


down,
 equities
 go
 up.
 The
 10-year
 also


is
 flat.
 That's
 actually
 a
 pretty
 good


scenario.
 Gold
 down
 10
 years
 flat,


equities
 green.
 I
 mean,
 this
 could
 be


setting
 up
 for
 an
 explosive
 Friday.
 It


really
 could.
 Might
 be
 a
 fun
 Friday
 for


a
 lot
 of
 us,
 but
 we
 got
 to
 see
 how
 this


can
 play
 out.
 All right.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Friday,


October
 24th,
 9:30
 a.m.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 S&P
 500
 opens
 at
 an
 official


all-time
 high.
 Look
 at
 that
 green


candle.


676,
 baby.
 Tesla
 450.
 Robin
 Hood
 138.


Palenture
 busting
 through
 184.
 They
 did


get
 that
 $200
 million
 contract
 with


Lumen
 yesterday
 and
 that
 was
 also
 very


bullish
 for
 them.
 S&P
 again
 675.95.
 SoFi


2880.
 Grabby
 Grab
 587.
 Google
 255.


Nvidia
 that's
 up
 1%.
 Maybe
 Nvidia


getting
 ready
 to
 go
 back
 to
 185.
 Amazon


222.
 It
 was
 at
 223
 a
 couple
 days
 ago


then
 got
 hit
 all
 the
 way
 to
 215.
 Maybe


coming
 back.
 Salesforce
 that's
 up
 1%.


Meta
 738
 that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent.


Ethereum
 trying
 to
 break
 through
 4,000.


Bitcoin
 111.
 Apple
 that's
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 ELF
 that's
 up
 1%.
 Apploven


that's
 up
 2.8.
 Pinterest
 is
 up.
 Circle


is
 up.
 Nvidia
 is
 up.
 Tesla
 just
 goes


red.
 Wow.
 I
 literally
 said
 450
 less
 than


30
 seconds
 ago
 and
 then
 it
 goes
 red.
 So


Tesla,
 you
 got
 a
 ton
 of
 sellers
 at
 450,


but
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 445,
 which
 is


not
 too
 bad.
 Wow.
 Pound
 here.
 2.7
 2.7


185
 again.
 190
 is
 that
 alltime
 high
 for


a
 pounder.
 Where
 is
 Micron?
 We
 are
 green


2.3%.
 ASML
 that
 is
 green
 by
 about
 half
 a


percent.
 Even
 SMCI
 took
 a
 nasty
 hit


yesterday.
 SMCI
 is
 up
 1.8%.
 Rocket
 Lab,


what
 do
 we
 got?
 Rocket
 Lab
 6413,


relatively
 flat,
 but
 still
 green.
 Uh,


ESTS
 7329,
 that's
 up
 about
 2%.
 Uber
 goes


red,
 but
 basically
 flat.
 Hims
 trying
 to


break
 through
 50
 again,
 49.68,
 that
 is


green.
 Robin
 Hood
 138.45,
 Google
 1%,
 S&P


67572.
 S&P
 very
 small
 red
 candle.
 Let's


see
 if
 it
 develops
 into
 anything
 more


substantial.
 We're
 seeing
 a
 couple
 red


candles
 on
 some
 of
 these
 names,
 but
 a


lot
 of
 these
 other
 names
 continuing
 to


move
 higher
 on
 this
 one.
 So,
 the


momentum
 names,
 they
 took
 a
 beating
 over


the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 Going
 back
 to
 what
 I


was
 saying
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 show,


maybe
 that
 beating
 is
 now
 over.
 If
 we


look
 at
 the
 rare
 earth
 stocks,
 they
 are


all
 green.
 CRML,
 MP,
 US,
 TMQ,
 LAC.
 If
 we


look
 at
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners,
 they
 are
 all


green.
 Cipher's
 up
 nine.
 Iron's
 up


eight.
 Clean
 Spark's
 up
 five.
 Bit
 farm's


up
 12.
 Marathon's
 up
 three.
 Riots's
 up


three.
 Galaxy
 is
 up
 three.
 Crowd
 Strike


yesterday
 that
 hit
 alltime
 highs.
 That's


at
 another
 alltime
 high.
 52971.
 That's


up
 1.48%.
 SoFi
 29.


Shout
 out
 to
 SoFi.
 Let's
 see
 if
 it
 can


break
 through
 30
 going
 into
 earnings.


Maybe.


Maybe.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 give
 you
 guys


credit
 because
 you
 guys
 told
 me
 a
 couple


days
 ago
 2680
 was
 the
 buy
 and
 we
 got
 it


at
 2680.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 Maybe
 we
 are


on
 the
 way
 to
 SoFi
 for
 30.
 Uh
 Tuesday


we'll
 have
 earnings
 on
 SoFi.


Tuesday
 we'll
 have
 earnings
 for
 SoFi
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 when
 can
 put
 up
 S&P


500.
 Wow.
 676
 is
 getting
 moved.
 676.
 We


are
 moving
 through
 that
 potentially
 for


677.


AMD
 alltime
 highs.
 Do
 we
 have
 AMD?
 Oh
 my


goodness.


AMD
 and
 SoFi.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 Do
 it.
 AMD.
 I


think
 she
 wants
 250.
 I
 think
 she
 wants
 I


think
 AMD
 wants
 250.
 I
 think
 SoFi
 wants


30.
 I
 think
 AMD
 wants
 250.
 I
 think
 SoFi


wants
 30.
 Let
 me
 check.
 Resistance
 on


AMD.
 24755.


248.
 Resistance
 on
 AMD
 is
 33,000
 shares.


That
 is
 not
 a
 lot.
 Nebia
 should
 be
 up
 if


AMD
 is
 up
 a
 lot.
 Nebius
 112.
 Nebius
 up


5.9%.
 Cororeevee
 which
 fell
 to
 115
 a


couple
 days
 ago.
 Coreweave
 126.


IBM
 and
 AMD
 news
 headline.
 Let
 me
 see.


IBM
 and
 AMD.


Um,


okay.
 This
 was
 a
 couple
 hours
 ago.


IBM
 says
 it
 can
 successfully
 run
 a


quantum
 computing
 algorithm
 on
 AMD


chips.
 The
 algorithm
 designed
 to
 correct


cubit
 errors
 was
 executed
 on
 AMD's


field.
 programmable
 gate
 arrays.
 IBM


plans
 to
 integrate
 the
 approach
 in
 2029.


All right.
 Well,
 we
 know
 about
 this


partnership
 from
 IBM
 and
 AMD
 from
 three


weeks
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 they
 talked
 about


this
 partnership
 around
 quantum


computing
 a
 while
 ago.
 Stock
 didn't


really
 react
 to
 that
 when
 they
 announced


three
 weeks
 ago,
 but
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this


when
 you
 get
 a
 CPI,
 that's
 as
 bullish
 as


we
 get
 it.
 There
 you
 Wow.
 AMD
 24875


busted
 through
 248
 right
 there.
 Nvidia


185.
 So,
 AMD
 really
 liking
 that


headline.
 S&P
 is
 about
 to
 go
 for
 677.


S&P
 is
 about
 to
 go
 for

on
 the
 day.
 Amazon

 Nice
 to
 see


Amazon
 coming
 back.
 S&P
 still
 67650.


SMCI
 is
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 50.
 Apple


almost
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs.
 ELF
 is
 up


on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 Bitcoin
 is
 green.
 I


am
 struggling
 to
 find
 anything
 that's


meaningfully
 red.
 GameStop,
 Eli
 Liy,


even
 Archer
 is
 up
 today.
 Door
 Dash.


There
 was
 a
 really
 stupid
 short
 report


that
 came
 out
 yesterday
 on
 Door
 Dash.
 I


mean,
 of
 all
 the
 companies
 you
 could


short,
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 going


short,
 Door
 Dash
 is
 just
 weird.
 Uh,
 but


Door
 Dash
 did
 get
 a
 short
 report


yesterday.
 Carried
 a
 little
 bit
 of


weakness,
 but
 that
 stock
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 AMD
 SoFi
 2950
 up
 24930.


I
 think
 she's
 going
 for
 250,
 folks.
 250


resistance
 on
 AMD
 I'm
 looking
 at
 right


now
 is


uh


198,000
 shares.


198,000
 shares.
 Tesla
 is
 red,
 but
 it
 was


red
 in
 the
 pre-market,


so
 that's
 not
 too
 surprising.
 Uh,
 you


know,
 also
 they,
 you
 know,
 they
 had


earnings
 this
 week,
 so
 the
 streets


probably
 reacting
 to
 that,
 but
 it's
 not


really
 down
 that
 much
 from
 earnings,


which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Hoodie
 back


to
 140.
 Hoodie
 back
 to

 Reddit
 above


207.
 AMD
 very
 close
 to
 250
 and
 the
 S&P


677.
 Wow,


guys,
 we
 did
 a
 round
 trip.
 We
 recovered.


We
 recovered
 and
 broke
 higher.
 We


recovered
 and
 broke
 higher.
 We
 fell
 all


the
 way
 to
 647


a
 week
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 and
 now
 it's
 at


677.


I
 mean,
 my
 goodness,


that
 is
 absolutely
 incredible.


Again,
 if
 you
 got
 if
 you
 got
 super


bearish
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 it
 ended
 up


being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the


bears,
 if
 they
 thought
 that
 was
 going
 to


be
 where
 they
 kind
 of
 find
 their
 way
 to


to
 make
 to
 to
 essentially
 call
 a
 thesis


that
 would
 stop
 the
 earnings
 growth,


stop
 the
 capex
 band,
 you
 know,
 claim


recession.
 We're
 just
 not
 there
 yet.
 We


don't
 have
 the
 data
 to
 suggest
 that's


the
 case.
 And
 the
 market's
 not
 acting


like
 that's
 the
 case
 either.
 Bitcoin
 111


as
 well.
 AMD
 very
 close
 to
 250.
 Here
 we


go.
 This
 is
 the
 push.


Intel
 earnings
 changed
 everything.
 Well,


Intel
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 numbers.


And
 here's
 the
 thing
 about
 Intel.
 If


Intel
 put
 up
 those
 numbers,
 you
 know,


beating
 EPS
 by
 2,000%.
 Are
 we
 not


expecting
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 to
 have
 some


good
 numbers?
 AMD
 250.
 There
 it
 is.
 AMD


250


for
 AMD.


250


250.


The
 bears
 are
 an
 extinct
 animal.
 The


bears
 might
 have
 to
 be
 an
 extinct


animal.
 We
 got
 to
 ring
 the
 bell.
 There


you
 go.
 AMD
 at
 250.


Dude,
 that
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 move.
 It
 was


only
 a
 week
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 when
 AMD


said,
 "We'll
 give
 up
 10%
 of
 our
 company


for
 OpenAI."
 And
 boy,
 did
 it
 pay


dividends.
 S&P
 is
 busting
 through
 677.


Did
 we
 hit
 30
 on
 SoFi
 again?
 No,
 we


didn't
 hit
 30
 on
 SoFi
 yet.
 2987.


Remember,
 3030
 is
 the
 all-time
 high
 for


SoFi.
 So,
 3030
 is
 what
 you
 got
 to
 beat


for
 SoFi
 to
 to
 really
 break
 above


potentially.
 Maybe
 that's
 where
 the


price
 discovery
 happens.
 But
 look
 at


that.
 AMD
 definitely
 getting
 some
 price


discovery.
 250.21.
 And
 then
 the
 S&P


potentially
 going
 for
 678.
 Google
 258.


Google,
 that's
 new
 all-time
 highs.


Amazon
 223.
 Salesforce
 up
 1%.


I
 mean,
 again,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


green
 Fridays.
 I
 know
 it's
 only
 been


eight
 minutes.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 see


pounder
 185.
 Robin
 trying
 to
 go
 for
 141.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 uh
 if
 the
 street


lets
 this
 continue,
 if
 they
 get
 upset,


if
 we
 get
 some
 algos
 come
 in
 or
 if
 this


is
 how
 we
 keep
 going.
 Amcor
 should
 be


green
 based
 on
 those
 Intel
 earnings.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Amcore
 3290.
 That's


up


2.8%
 as
 well.
 If
 we
 can
 get
 Ethereum
 to


start
 moving,
 then
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


even
 more
 fun
 because
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of


crypto
 derivative
 assets,
 Micro


Strategy,
 Ethereum,
 Coinbase
 that
 are


probably
 waiting
 for
 another
 20%
 gap
 up


if
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 can
 help
 help


the
 party.
 But
 you
 have
 these
 going


green.
 Coinbase
 right
 there,
 that's
 up


5.4%
 of
 the
 day.


I
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 days


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been
 waiting


for.
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 blessed
 with
 a
 lot


of
 these
 days
 back
 in
 September
 and


August,
 and
 maybe
 it
 got
 too
 normal,


which
 is
 why
 we
 have
 to
 go
 through
 the


choppiness
 of
 October.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


we're
 out
 of
 the
 woods
 yet
 for
 October.


I
 mean,
 we
 got
 to
 see
 how
 the
 rest
 of


the
 the
 earning
 cycle
 plays
 out,
 but
 um


it
 definitely
 feels
 like
 this
 has
 been


one
 of
 those
 days
 that's
 been
 coiling
 up


and
 it
 needed
 a
 catalyst
 and
 it
 got
 the


CPI
 and
 that
 was
 the
 catalyst
 and
 here


we
 are.
 Here
 we
 are
 giving
 some
 people


opportunities
 if
 they
 bought
 the
 dip.


SoFi
 right
 there,
 2950
 and
 then
 AMD
 just


below


250.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 congrats
 to
 you
 if


you're an
 AMD.
 This
 was
 one
 of the
 names


that
 was
 hated
 for
 a
 good
 amount
 of
 time


and
 if
 you
 just
 trusted
 Lisa
 Sue,
 who
 is


an
 absolute
 rockar,
 it
 ended
 up
 playing


out.
 I
 mean,
 this
 thing
 got
 to
 70
 back


in
 April
 and
 then
 after
 it
 got
 from
 70,


it
 was
 basically
 stuck
 at
 105
 for
 a


while.
 And
 that
 open
 AI
 deal
 kind
 of


changed
 the
 dynamics
 of
 everything.
 Even


Apploven
 app
 was
 at
 540
 a
 couple
 days


ago
 at
 613
 now.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names


kind
 of
 just
 taking
 off
 right
 here.


Microsoft
 that's
 still
 up
 523
 as
 well.


How
 about
 Lumen?
 We
 know
 they
 announced


their
 partnership
 with
 Palunteer


yesterday.
 Lumen
 is
 up
 5%.
 Lumen
 getting


a
 boost


from
 this
 as
 well.
 Uh
 Oracle,
 where
 is


Oracle?
 They
 were
 down
 yesterday
 after


did
 the
 debt
 offering.
 Oracle
 is
 up
 2.3.


Uh
 Oracle
 still
 down
 from
 that
 350
 high


it
 hit
 in
 September.


Look,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 debt


offering
 is
 not
 bearish
 if
 you
 think


there
 is
 going to
 be an
 ROI.
 It
 is


bearish
 if
 you
 think
 the
 ROI
 is
 far
 from


here
 and
 it
 might
 take,
 you
 know,


multiple
 multiple
 decades
 versus
 five
 to


seven
 years.
 But
 overall,
 it
 feels
 like


the
 more
 excitement
 these
 data
 center


plays
 get,
 even
 if
 they're
 financed


through
 debt,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 the
 worst


thing
 in
 the
 world.
 Did
 we
 hit
 186
 on


pounder?
 Wow,
 we
 did
 hit
 186
 on
 pounder.


We
 got
 pounder
 earnings
 coming
 up.
 We


got
 pounder
 earnings
 coming
 up.


Maybe
 that
 can
 create
 some
 more


excitement.
 Tesla
 again.
 Tesla,
 one
 of


the
 only
 names
 that's
 red.
 Now
 it's


actually
 really
 getting
 red.
 Almost
 2%


down.
 What
 else
 is
 red?
 Let's
 pull
 up


some
 of
 these
 other
 watch
 list.
 Uh


semis,
 I
 would
 imagine,
 are
 all
 green
 on


the
 day.
 Semis
 are
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.


Across
 the
 board,
 Intel
 up
 6%.
 And


Intel's
 now
 up
 90%
 for
 the
 year.
 TSM
 up


2%.
 Marll
 up
 1%.
 Qualcomm
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 Micron
 up
 3%.
 Dell
 up
 two.
 And


then
 AMD
 up
 6.3.
 Netflix
 is
 red.
 Oh,
 we


haven't
 looked
 at
 Netflix.
 Netflix.


Wow.
 Netflix
 it
 is.
 Dude,
 Netflix
 is


about
 to
 give
 up
 a
 big
 level
 of
 support.


They
 gave
 up,
 1100
 already
 earlier
 in


the
 week.
 If
 they
 actually
 give
 that
 up,


you're
 in
 the
 thousands
 on
 Netflix.


Yeah,
 I
 guess
 I
 again
 if
 Netflix
 did
 not


have
 a
 $700
 million
 charge
 from
 the


Brazilian
 tax
 authorities,
 they
 would


have
 be
 earnings.
 So
 that's
 why
 even
 if


you're
 not
 a
 Netflix
 shareholder,
 if
 you


just,
 you
 know,
 care
 about
 the
 broader


market
 holding
 up,
 Netflix
 didn't
 miss


because,
 you
 know,
 consumers
 aren't


willing
 to
 to
 pay
 15
 bucks
 a
 month


anymore.
 It's
 just
 because
 of
 taxes.


Feels
 like
 that's
 the
 main
 reason
 they


should
 have
 split.
 Yeah,
 they
 should


have
 split.
 Bro,
 I
 I
 would
 have
 bought


some
 Netflix
 the
 day
 they
 split.
 Dude,


sell
 some
 calls
 against
 it.
 Would
 have


been
 easy.
 But


they
 met
 at
 Costco.
 They've
 not
 done
 the


split
 yet.
 Open
 door
 770.
 You
 got
 a
 10%


move
 on
 Open
 Door.
 You
 got
 a
 10%
 move
 on


Open
 Door.
 Is
 Beyond
 Meat
 still
 green?


Beyond
 Meat?


Um,


yes,
 it's
 green
 5%.
 It
 was
 up
 19%
 of
 the


pre-markets.
 How
 about
 Danut?


DNU
 is
 red.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 meme


stocks
 not
 really
 pushing
 on.
 Grab
 at


582.
 That's
 up
 1.75%.


Uh,
 SoFi
 29.40.
 SoFi
 is
 really
 trying
 to


push
 a
 break
 above
 30,
 I
 feel
 like,


would
 be
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 to
 end
 out
 the


week.


Level
 one
 options
 is
 on
 SoFi.
 NOT
 was


talking
 about
 it
 yesterday.
 So,
 I
 mean,


you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 going


into
 earnings.
 I
 think
 NOT
 seems
 pretty


optimistic.
 And
 then
 again,
 all
 the


banks
 already
 crushed
 it.
 So,
 you
 can


imagine
 that
 we
 should
 be
 continuing
 to


see
 more
 banks
 do
 well.
 Did
 Google
 break


259?
 Really?
 Wow.
 Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 check


resistance
 on
 the
 Googles.


Dude,
 I
 think
 we
 might
 see
 260
 for
 the


first
 time.
 It's
 50
 cents
 away.


Google
 47,000
 shares
 at
 260.


47,000
 shares
 at
 260.


Um,
 couple
 other
 quotes
 from
 Hasset.


Inflation
 is
 decelerating,
 takes


pressure
 off
 the
 Fed.
 Trump
 is


frustrated
 with
 progress
 making
 on


Canada.
 Uh,
 National
 Economic
 Council


Hasset
 says
 that
 Trump
 will
 speak
 to


Canada
 by
 the
 end
 of
 term.


Oh,
 so
 got
 a
 price
 target
 upgrade
 24
 to


26
 by
 JP
 Morgan.
 That's
 probably
 another


reason
 why
 it's
 running
 today.
 24
 to
 26.


They
 maintain
 a
 neutral,
 so
 they're
 not


saying
 to
 buy.
 I
 love
 when
 they
 upgrade


the
 price,
 but
 they
 say
 don't
 buy
 it.


They're
 like,
 "Hey,
 we
 think
 it's
 going


higher,
 but
 don't
 buy
 the
 stock."
 It's


always
 funny
 when
 that
 happens.
 But
 you


do
 have
 a
 green
 upgrade
 right
 there.
 And


then
 UNH
 360.


UNH
 slightly
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Where
 is


Oscar?
 Oscar
 is
 I
 mean,
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it


was


from
 the
 Molina
 Healthcare
 20%
 draw


down.
 Molina's
 down,
 Oscar's
 up,


and
 you
 got
 some
 more
 of
 that
 green.


Yeah,
 the
 anthropic
 announcement
 for


Google,
 that
 was
 also
 very,
 very


bullish.
 That
 was
 also
 very,
 very


bullish
 as
 well,
 which
 was
 nice
 to
 see.


Um,


Alphabet
 right
 there
 at
 258,
 Open
 Door


still
 moving.
 And
 again,
 Lending
 Club


had
 a
 great
 earnings
 as
 well,
 so
 that


should
 also
 be
 pretty
 damn
 bullish
 for


SoFi.
 1895
 on
 Lending
 Club,
 Google
 258.


You're
 seeing
 a
 couple
 of
 red
 candles
 on


some
 of
 these
 stocks,
 but
 overall,
 I


know
 it's
 only
 15
 minutes
 in.
 Market's


trying
 to
 see
 if
 they
 can
 actually
 hold


it
 green.
 Um,


again,
 there's
 not
 that
 many
 names
 I'm


seeing
 that's
 red.
 Look
 at
 the
 heat
 map


here.
 We
 are
 pretty
 much
 green
 across


the
 board.


So,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum


going
 green.


And
 now
 we
 think
 we
 just
 want
 to
 see
 if


we
 can
 hold
 it
 till
 the
 end
 of the
 day.


App
 right
 there.
 616.


Tesla
 trying
 to
 recover
 as
 well.
 Oh,
 we


got
 PMI.
 Hold
 on.
 We
 got
 PMI.
 That's


some
 more
 data.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 Looks
 like
 it's
 a


beat
 on
 PMI
 as
 well,
 which
 is
 good.
 Uh,


PMI
 comes
 in
 at
 52.2
 versus
 52
 expected.


Services
 PMI
 55.2
 versus
 53.5.
 That's
 a


big
 beat.
 Overall
 composite
 PMI
 54.8


versus
 53.9.


So
 those
 are
 two
 beats,
 one
 miss.
 The


miss
 was
 very
 slight.


And
 also
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 consumer


sentiment
 in
 15
 minutes.
 But
 there's


your
 PMI
 54.8
 versus
 53.9,


52.2
 versus
 52.2,
 and
 then
 services
 55.2


versus
 54.2.


Dude,
 that
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 I
 mean,


those
 are
 some
 pretty
 decent
 PMI
 numbers


along
 with
 good
 CPI.
 Yeah,
 look
 at
 the


S&P
 new
 alltime
 high.
 S&P
 loves
 it.
 S&P


loves
 it.


She
 wants
 to
 break
 678.
 Dude,
 if
 we


touch
 680,


if
 we
 touch
 680
 today,


I
 think
 the
 bears
 might
 be
 in
 shambles


if
 that
 happens
 to
 I
 think
 the
 bears


might
 be
 This
 is
 what
 this
 market
 has


done
 to
 bears.
 Every
 time
 they
 give
 you


a
 little
 bit
 of
 juice
 and
 you
 think,


"All
 right,
 this
 is
 the
 narrative
 that


ruins
 everything.
 This
 is
 what
 collapses


the
 financial
 system."


It's
 like,
 no,
 that's
 just
 that's
 it.
 It


ends
 up
 being
 a
 buying
 opportunity.


It
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Steve


and
 I
 were
 talking
 about
 this
 last


night.
 What
 if
 the
 next
 five
 years
 just


ends
 up
 being
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 going
 out
 10


years
 or
 15
 years.
 I'm
 going
 out
 just


the
 next
 five
 years.
 I
 know
 the
 markets


have
 always
 been
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 if
 you
 if


you
 zoom
 out
 long
 enough,
 but
 in
 the


past
 two
 years
 it
 has
 been
 a
 legit
 3
 to


5%
 draw
 down.
 You
 hammer
 the
 buy
 button.


And
 I
 think
 this
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the


only
 times
 in
 history
 where
 on
 a
 four
 to


5%
 draw
 down,
 even,
 you
 know,
 2%
 draw


down.
 Everyone
 hammers
 the
 buy
 button.
 I


don't
 know if
 we're
 ever
 going
 to
 have
 a


stock
 market
 where
 you
 have
 a
 multi-year


cycle
 where
 you
 see
 a
 dip,
 you
 buy.
 I


mean,
 we
 saw
 that
 on
 October
 10th.
 Bank


of
 America
 came
 out
 and
 said
 it
 was
 the


largest
 single
 day
 inflow
 for
 individual


equities
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the
 stock


market
 and
 the
 S&P
 was
 down
 3%.
 Which


should
 be
 a
 relatively
 normal
 pullback.


Like
 that's
 not
 even
 that's
 not
 even
 a


correction.


And
 it
 has
 just
 become
 an
 opportunity


for
 people
 to
 get
 more
 exposure.
 And
 and


Steve's
 point
 last
 night
 is
 that
 there's


so
 much
 more
 money
 in
 the
 system,
 not


just
 from
 liquidity,
 but
 from
 investors


that
 are
 interested,
 people
 that
 have


signed
 up
 to
 Robin
 Hood
 for
 the
 first


time,
 you
 know,
 people
 that
 are
 watching


investing
 content
 and
 they
 care
 more


about
 allocating
 their
 capital
 than,
 you


know,
 doing
 a
 different
 type
 of
 hobby.


This
 becomes
 a
 sport
 for
 them.
 Like
 like


that's
 just
 leading
 to
 more
 liquidity


and
 as
 a
 result,
 people
 want
 to
 invest.


And
 what
 do
 they
 invest
 in?
 They


probably
 invest
 in
 things
 they
 know
 like


Amazon
 because
 they
 use
 Amazon
 every
 day


or
 a
 Google,


you
 know,
 the
 these
 are
 the
 names
 that


get
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 liquidity.


Doug
 says,
 "Retail
 owns
 too
 much
 now.


Tootses
 haven't
 figured
 out
 yet
 how
 to


force
 retail
 to
 sell
 low."
 That
 is
 such


a
 good
 point.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 the


tootses
 have
 figured
 out
 how
 to
 scare


retail
 into
 really
 selling
 at
 the
 lows.


And
 boy,
 did
 they
 try
 during
 April
 and


that
 [ __ ]
 did
 not
 work.
 Robin
 back
 to


140.
 It
 just
 did
 not
 work.


Meta
 going
 red.
 Not
 sure
 why
 Meta
 is


red.
 I'll
 see
 if
 there's
 a
 headline.


Meta
 did
 break
 740
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


a
 month
 and
 a
 half.
 So
 maybe
 there
 is


some
 resistance
 on
 a
 technical
 level.


Wow,
 Meta
 got
 an
 upgrade
 today
 to
 900


from
 Truist


and
 they
 got
 another
 upgrade
 to
 900
 from


Stifle.
 Two
 $900
 upgrades
 today
 and
 the


stock's
 going
 red.
 You
 know
 what
 that


tells
 me?
 That
 tells
 me
 the
 street
 is


not
 that
 confident
 that
 Zucks
 is
 not


going
 to
 screw
 them
 with
 a
 quarter
 where


he
 spends
 like
 he
 did
 back
 in
 2022.
 And


I
 think
 the
 street's
 waiting
 for
 the


earnings
 just
 to
 confirm
 that
 Zucks
 is


not
 being
 reckless
 with
 the
 spend.


Which,
 by
 the
 way,
 that
 was
 the


narrative
 going
 into
 Q2
 and
 they
 ended


up
 beating
 earnings
 by
 uh
 it
 was
 about


23%
 and
 that
 narrative
 went
 away.
 But


then
 they
 started
 hiring
 all
 these
 AI


researchers
 for
 billions
 of
 dollars
 and


maybe
 that
 narrative
 is
 coming
 back.


But
 Meta
 right
 there
 going
 red.
 Bitcoin


also
 going
 red.
 You
 got
 a
 red
 candle
 on


Biddy
 and
 Meta.
 EU
 investigation.
 Is


there
 an
 EU
 investigation?
 Maybe
 that


could
 be
 the
 headline.
 Not
 sure
 why


crypto


is
 going
 down.


Um,
 oh
 yep,
 here
 we
 go.
 The
 European


Commission
 found
 Tik
 Tok
 and
 Meta
 in


breach
 of
 transparency
 obligations
 under


the
 EU's
 digital
 service
 act
 lacking


adequate
 data
 access
 for
 researchers
 and


failing
 to
 provide
 users
 with
 effective


reporting
 mechanisms
 for
 illegal


content.


Okay,
 so
 the
 digital
 services
 act
 in
 the


European
 Union
 has
 been
 violated
 by
 Tik


Tok
 and
 Meta.
 There's
 no
 like


implication
 on
 the
 fine
 that
 Meta
 would


have
 to
 pay
 about
 this.


Also,
 I
 mean,
 Meta
 has
 violated
 every


single
 data
 privacy
 act
 over
 the
 past
 15


years.
 I
 don't
 know if
 that
 would
 be
 the


narrative
 to
 hurt
 the
 stock,
 but
 that's


why
 you're
 seeing
 that
 gut
 reaction
 of


Meta
 going
 red.
 S&P
 also
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red


candle
 from
 660


from
 677
 to
 660.


There
 it
 is
 right
 there.


Um,
 and
 then
 SoFi
 still
 trying
 to
 hold


on
 to
 2950.


Not
 sure
 why
 crypto's
 down
 though.
 Not


sure
 why
 crypto
 is
 losing
 its
 steam.


Yeah,
 Bitcoin
 officially
 going
 red.


That's
 weird.
 That
 is
 weird.
 You
 got
 the


S&P
 at
 alltime
 highs
 and
 gold's
 going


up,
 by
 the
 way.
 Gold
 was
 down
 a
 bit
 more


at
 9:30.
 Gold
 is
 now
 recovering
 some
 of


those
 losses.
 So,
 you
 got
 gold
 going
 up,


Bitcoin
 going
 down,


and
 uh
 the
 market's
 going
 up.


Grinder
 is
 up
 26%.


Um,
 Grinder
 received
 a
 non-binding
 one


$18
 per
 share
 take
 private
 proposal.


Okay,
 so
 Grinder,
 we
 we
 I
 mean
 we
 talked


about
 this
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 They
 did


get
 a
 private
 equity
 firm
 say
 they
 want


to
 buy
 them
 out.
 $18
 per
 share
 is
 the


proposal.
 That's
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 up


27%.
 That
 means
 there's
 some
 alpha.
 If


you
 think
 the
 buyout
 happens
 at
 18,
 you


could
 buy
 it
 at
 16,
 make
 two
 bucks
 a


share.
 Now,
 if
 the
 buyout
 doesn't


happen,
 then
 you
 could
 be
 bag
 holding


that.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 careful
 here.


But
 you
 do
 have
 some
 green.
 Thank
 you


for
 the
 congratulations.
 I
 appreciate


it.
 It's
 my
 first
 institutional


takeover.


Hoping
 to
 uh
 to
 take
 over
 a
 lot
 more


companies
 over
 the
 lifetime
 of
 of


building
 out
 my
 my
 holding
 enterprise.


So,
 it
 does
 mean
 a
 lot.
 It
 does
 mean
 a


lot.
 Intel,
 are
 we
 at
 41?
 No,
 Intel


loses
 40.


Okay.
 Intel
 loses
 40.
 3980.


Got
 Intel
 going
 down.
 Dell
 still
 up
 2%.


Tessy
 now
 it's
 getting
 worse
 for
 Tessy.


Robin
 Hood's
 getting
 better
 for
 Robin


Hood.
 That's
 weird.
 Bitcoin's
 down,
 but


Robin
 Hood's
 up
 5%.


That
 is
 so
 weird.


That
 usually
 is
 not
 how
 it
 plays
 out,


but
 you
 got
 Robin
 Hood
 moving
 much


higher.
 Palunteer
 is
 still
 holding
 up


nicely
 at
 3%.


Openoro
 back
 to
 $8.
 Open
 door
 hasn't


seen
 $8
 in
 about
 Well,
 let's
 see
 the


last
 time.
 Last
 time
 they
 saw
 eight


bucks
 was


October
 10th.
 Yeah.
 a
 little
 October


10th
 was
 that
 day
 that
 created
 a
 draw


down
 a
 lot
 of these
 names.
 So
 basically


two
 weeks
 and
 now
 it's
 back
 to
 eight


bucks.
 That's
 up
 14%.
 And
 then
 SoFi


2940.
 Rocket
 Lab


6531.


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 reason
 why
 Open


Door
 is
 up.
 I
 just
 think
 everything
 is


up
 and
 momentum
 draw
 down
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 I


mean
 let's
 look
 at
 Oaklo.
 Oaklo


134
 that's
 up
 8%.
 So
 Oaklo
 now
 for
 the


week
 is
 down
 20%.


But
 maybe
 that's
 the
 end
 of
 it,
 right?


Maybe
 that's
 it.


Now
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 these
 stocks
 are


necessarily
 cheap,
 even
 if
 the
 draw
 down


is
 over.
 Um,
 but
 if
 the
 structural
 draw


down
 is
 not
 as
 aggressive,


then
 maybe
 that's
 where
 they
 ended
 up


bottoming
 bottoming
 out.
 Iran
 back
 to


61.
 Iran
 was
 at
 74,
 fell
 all
 the
 way
 to


50,
 back
 to
 61.
 on
 the
 data
 center
 news


last
 night
 was
 super
 bullish
 for
 Iran.


So,
 makes
 sense
 that
 Iran
 is
 getting
 up.


Ford
 down
 9%


or
 sorry,
 Ford
 is
 up
 9%
 which
 makes


sense.
 Um,
 they
 beat
 their
 adjusted
 free


cash
 flow
 as
 well
 by
 about
 $2
 billion


which
 you
 don't
 see
 a
 company
 like
 Ford


do
 often.
 Last
 time
 Ford
 was
 at
 1346,


July
 2024.
 That's
 a
 big
 move
 on
 Ford.


That's
 a
 big
 freaking
 move
 on
 forward.


45
 million
 shares
 of
 volume
 in
 the
 first


20
 minutes.


That
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 move


on
 forward.
 There's
 the
 heat
 map.
 Pretty


much
 green.
 J&J's
 down
 a
 little bit.


Walmart's
 down
 a
 little
 bit.
 And
 then


Tesla's
 down.


Netflix
 down.
 Everything
 else
 is
 holding


up.


There's
 Josh.
 Yes.
 SoFi
 is
 looking
 for


30
 again.
 That's
 correct.


Um,


do
 we
 have
 some
 statements
 from
 Canada?


Prime
 Minister
 Carney,
 we
 can
 focus
 on


new
 partnerships,
 including
 with
 Asia.


Oh,
 they
 must
 be
 asking
 him
 about


Trump's
 comments.


Did
 he
 Did
 he
 apologize?
 Did
 he
 Is
 he


going
 to
 bend
 the
 knee?


Uh,


we
 can't
 control
 trade
 policy.
 The
 US


recognized
 US
 policy
 has
 changed.
 Dude,


are
 they
 actually
 beefing,
 bro?
 Are
 they


legit
 beefing?


May
 maybe
 Trump
 used
 that
 Reagan


commercial
 as
 a
 scapegoat
 to
 like
 hide


how
 much
 he's
 annoyed
 with
 Canada
 and
 he


used
 that
 as
 his
 reasoning.
 Look,
 based


on
 these
 Canadian
 prime
 minister


comments,
 it
 kind
 of
 looks
 like


they
 are
 beefing
 a
 little
 bit.
 Nvidia


still
 green,
 which
 is
 weird
 because
 they


were
 literally
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 two


weeks
 ago
 laughing


and
 Trump
 was
 like,
 "This
 is
 a
 great


man.
 He's
 a
 smart
 man."
 They
 were,
 you


know,
 they
 were
 they
 were
 the
 media
 was


laughing.
 Like,
 it
 was
 a
 very
 amicable


press
 conference.


It's
 kind
 of
 wild,
 bro.
 You're
 in
 the


Oval
 Office
 with
 someone,
 you
 think
 you


have
 a
 deal,
 you
 think
 you're
 nice,
 you


think
 you
 can
 negotiate,
 and
 then
 two


weeks
 later,
 you're
 fighting
 on
 Twitter.


like
 that's
 been
 the
 the
 story
 with


Trump
 and
 a
 lot
 of these
 leaders


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months.


Um,


okay.
 So,
 that
 one
 is
 causing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 red,
 but
 overall
 you're
 not


seeing
 that
 much
 weakness
 from
 these


from
 these
 comments.
 S&P
 still
 holding


677.
 We
 are
 in
 those
 new
 all-time
 highs.


Google
 very
 close
 to
 260.
 Very,
 very


close
 to
 260.
 It's
 High
 School
 Musical


Mid.
 Yeah,
 it
 feels
 like
 High
 School


Musical.
 Feels
 like
 there's
 old
 clicks.


AMD
 251.
 She
 hit
 251.


Wow,
 dude.
 What
 a
 day.
 What
 a
 freaking


day.


Um,


uh,


680
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 going
 to
 have
 some


resistance.


You
 do
 have
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 option


flow
 coming
 in
 on
 it,
 though.


White
 House
 Hasset
 adviser
 says


negotiations
 with
 Canadians
 have
 not


been
 going
 well.


Negotiations
 with
 Canadians
 have
 not


been
 going
 well.
 That's
 Hasset
 on
 Fox


News
 just
 now.
 Okay,
 so
 that's
 why
 Trump


tweeted
 what
 he
 tweeted.
 It's
 almost


like
 when
 Trump
 tweeted
 about
 the


soybeans
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 and
 the
 rare


rare
 earth
 exports,
 it
 was
 more
 so
 about


him
 voicing
 his
 frustration
 with
 China


versus
 him
 like
 trying
 to
 start
 a
 fight


or
 anything.
 It
 seems
 like
 same
 thing


with
 Canada.
 He's
 a
 bit
 annoyed
 at


Canada
 and
 that's
 why
 he's
 putting
 this


stuff
 out.
 Robin
 Hood
 142


142.


Uh
 Hasset
 also
 said
 the
 shutdown
 could


drop
 GDP
 by
 tenth
 of
 a
 percent
 each


week.


We
 talked
 about
 this
 yesterday,
 but
 uh


the
 reason
 the
 shutdown
 might
 last


longer
 is
 because
 the
 debt
 sealing


negotiations
 are
 not
 anytime
 soon.
 Every


other
 time
 we've
 had
 a
 shutdown,
 it's


coincided
 with
 the
 debt
 sealing


negotiations.
 And
 so
 that's
 where,
 you


know,
 most
 reasonable
 senators
 come


together
 and
 say
 we
 should
 probably
 do


something
 about
 this.
 You
 don't
 have


that
 type
 of
 pressure
 this
 time.
 And
 as


a
 result,
 that
 might
 not
 be
 the
 same


reason
 for
 why
 we
 don't
 get


negotiations.
 Open
 door
 right
 there.


Wow.
 20%
 on
 open
 door.
 I
 don't
 see
 an


open
 door
 headline.
 If
 anyone
 has
 one,


let
 me
 know.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 more
 so


just
 rate
 cuts
 and
 then,
 you
 know,


momentum
 from
 CPI.


Maybe
 it's
 the
 potential
 Robin
 Hood


tokenization
 partnership.
 I
 mean
 like


there's
 nothing
 confirmed
 on
 that,
 but


people
 could
 be
 thinking
 there
 could
 be.


But
 outside
 of
 that,
 you
 are
 getting
 a


move
 right
 there.
 Yeah,
 there
 is
 no


confirmation
 on
 a
 partnership,
 but
 you


do
 have
 people
 potentially
 thinking


there
 is
 a
 partnership.


Um,


Open
 Door
 833,


Nvidia
 still
 holding
 1.8
 Tesla


potentially
 going
 below
 439
 and
 then


SoFi
 2946.


All right,
 so
 what
 do
 we
 think?
 Are
 we


out
 of
 the
 woods
 on
 momentum
 or
 momentum


stocks?
 The
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 probably
 has


to
 be
 up
 today.
 The
 meme
 stock
 ETF.


Yeah,
 look
 at
 that
 dude.
 It's
 up
 5.9%.


Do
 people
 think
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 2025
 a


lot
 of
 these
 momentum
 names
 are
 out
 of


the
 woods
 and
 they
 have
 some
 room
 to


breathe
 without
 having
 to
 worry
 about


getting
 hit?


That
 is
 the
 qu
 until
 the
 China
 tweets.


Yeah,
 literally
 right,
 dude.
 We
 still


have
 negotiations
 into
 next
 week.
 I


mean,
 we
 need
 to
 freaking
 hope
 that


meeting
 with
 Xi
 does
 not
 have
 any


issues.


We
 need
 to
 Yeah,
 even
 Novo
 is
 green


today.
 Look
 at
 that.
 We
 need
 to
 hope
 we


don't
 have
 any
 issues
 with
 Gi.
 If
 so,
 I


think
 we're
 in
 a
 much
 better
 situation.


Or
 at least
 I
 would
 hope
 so.
 Stock


draft.
 Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 that.
 What


do
 we
 got
 going
 on?
 Uh,
 Matt's
 at
 45.


I'm
 back
 to
 40.
 Steve's
 at
 nine.


Tanner's
 at
 24.
 Tanner
 was
 at
 20
 a


couple
 days
 ago.
 So,
 that's
 a
 big
 move.


And
 then
 Chris
 is
 at
 10.


So,
 Matt's
 nearly
 at
 45.
 And
 I
 am
 at
 40.


Google,
 are
 we
 at
 260?
 We
 are
 at
 260,


folks.


260
 Dellores
 for
 the
 Googs.


Please,
 Trump,
 do
 not
 ruin
 the
 holidays


for
 the
 USA.


Yeah,
 if
 we
 could
 just
 get
 a
 very
 normal


holiday
 season
 with
 some
 equities
 going


higher,
 that
 would
 be
 fun.
 I
 mean,
 dude,


7,000
 Meta,
 by
 the
 way,
 going
 green


again.
 7,000.
 Is
 that
 in
 play?


Is
 that
 in
 play
 for
 the
 S&P?


Google
 260.32,
 that's
 up
 2.8%.


Palenter
 185,
 Robin
 Hood
 141,
 Nvidia
 up


1.8.


again,
 dude.
 It's
 just
 like
 over
 the


past
 two
 weeks,
 over
 the
 past
 two
 years,


every
 dip
 has
 been
 a
 buy.
 Every
 single


one
 has
 just
 been
 one
 of
 those
 you
 got


to
 buy.
 You
 got
 to
 take
 advantage
 of


these
 opportunities.
 And
 the
 worst
 thing


is,
 look,
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 if
 you're


a
 fund
 manager,
 as
 Tom
 Lee
 was
 saying,


that
 hasn't
 performed
 and
 you
 didn't
 buy


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 and
 now
 you


follow
 into
 Google
 at
 260
 or
 you
 just


have
 to
 buy
 higher.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 it's


tough.


It
 is.
 It
 is
 a
 lot
 tougher,
 but
 that


just
 is
 better
 for
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 as


you
 compound
 some
 of
 the
 [ __ ]
 I


think
 we
 have
 some
 macro
 data.
 Let
 me


pull
 this
 up.
 Let's
 see
 what
 we
 have


here.


>> Hi,
 Lesie.
 Indeed,
 just
 crossing
 the


tape.
 These
 are
 October
 final
 reads
 to


replace
 the
 midmon
 read.
 And
 the
 midmon


read
 of
 55
 deteriorates
 to
 53.6.


53.6.
 That
 would
 be
 the
 weakest
 level


going
 back
 to
 May
 of
 this
 year.
 If
 we


look
 at
 the
 current
 conditions
 from
 61


midmon
 to
 58.6


58


>> this
 is
 consumer
 confidence


>> 6
 will
 be
 the
 weakest
 going
 back
 to
 b


you're
 going
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 July
 of


22.
 July
 of
 22
 on
 expectation
 same
 50.3


and
 that
 is
 from
 51.2
 a
 big


deterioration
 there.
 That
 would
 be
 the


weakest
 going
 back
 to
 May
 of
 this
 year


when
 it
 was
 under
 50.
 Now
 let's
 get
 to


the
 inflation
 data.
 The
 midmon
 at
 4.6


remains
 at
 4.6.
 However,
 the
 5
 to
 10year


read
 moves
 from
 3.7
 to
 3.9,
 the
 warmest


since
 June
 when
 it
 was
 4%.
 We
 see
 that


yields
 are
 back
 up
 as
 Carl
 just
 pointed


out.
 And
 do
 keep
 in
 mind
 we
 settled
 at


401
 last
 week
 on
 a
 10
 which
 means
 you're


about
 unchanged
 for
 the
 week.
 We
 settled


at
 398
 yesterday.
 We're
 up
 on
 the


session.
 Same
 for
 two-year.
 Uh
 two-year


346
 last
 week
 up
 two.
 Uh
 yesterday
 it


was
 exactly
 uh
 at
 346.
 Uh
 so
 we're
 uh


excuse
 me.
 Yeah,
 we're
 down
 a
 couple


there
 as
 well.
 Maybe
 the
 most
 important


feature
 continues
 to
 be
 that
 the
 CPI


data
 was
 cooler
 than
 expectations.
 The


initial
 market
 move
 was
 lower
 yields
 and


higher
 equities
 as
 it
 sunk
 in
 that
 were


well
 above
 the
 2%
 target.
 rates
 came


back,
 but
 we
 still
 see
 that
 the


pre-opening
 equities
 held
 good
 and
 the


final
 equity
 markets
 are
 also
 way
 in
 the


green.
 Mike
 Santoi,
 back
 to
 you.
 Okay,


so
 uh
 consumer
 confidence
 street
 wanted


at
 54.5.
 We
 came
 in
 at
 53.6.


Again,
 they
 surveyed
 like
 a
 couple


hundred
 people,
 so
 it's
 not
 the
 biggest


important
 piece
 of
 data,
 but
 the


street's
 not
 reacting
 to
 it
 negatively.


Google
 261.


What's
 the
 market
 cap
 now?
 Google,
 that


is
 another
 all-time
 high.
 Google
 3.1


trillion.
 Google
 has
 hit
 3.1
 trillion.


Nvidia
 is
 at
 4.5.
 Apple's
 at
 3.8.


Microsoft
 is
 at
 3.8.
 By
 the
 way,


Microsoft
 and
 Apple,
 they're
 not
 that


far
 away
 from
 4
 trillion.
 It
 is
 not
 that


crazy
 to
 say
 on
 December
 31st,
 we
 might


have
 three
 4
 trillion
 dollar
 companies


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Uh,
 but
 you
 got


Google
 right
 there
 moving
 260.
 Consumer


confidence
 not
 really
 affecting
 the


market.
 AMD
 251
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 252
 and


then
 S&P
 potentially
 going
 for
 678


potentially
 going
 for
 678
 which
 would
 be


again
 another


alltime
 high


this
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 today
 dude


this
 is
 pretty
 incredible
 50.3
 versus


51.2
 2
 on
 inflation
 index
 as
 well.


Again,
 a
 bit
 lower
 than
 expected,
 but


Street


not
 caring
 too
 much.
 Uh,
 we
 got
 some


option
 flow.
 Someone's
 buying
 the
 75


uh
 let
 me
 see.


Someone's
 buying
 the
 $75
 call
 for
 HUD
 8


mining.
 1.8
 million
 of
 it


for
 January
 2027.
 Someone
 just
 bought


about
 2
 million
 of
 the
 HUT75
 call
 for


January
 2027.
 There
 you
 go.
 Hut
 right


there
 up
 8%
 on
 the
 day.
 They
 have


earnings
 in
 11
 days.
 So
 you
 got
 some
 OP.


This
 is
 another
 Bitcoin
 miner
 turn
 data


center.
 You
 got
 more
 and
 more
 people


feeling
 bullish
 on
 those.
 And
 then


Google
 again
 just
 below


261.
 Where
 is
 Nebius?


Nebius
 1371.


Intel's
 down.
 Really?
 Intel
 loses
 it.


Wow,


dude.
 Intel
 was
 at
 4150
 yesterday.
 All


right,
 so
 people
 are
 Okay,
 so
 here's
 the


question
 for
 everybody.
 Trim
 or
 no?
 Trim


or
 no?


Taking
 some
 profits
 or
 no?
 What
 are


people
 thinking?


What
 are
 people
 thinking?
 Letting
 the


show
 go
 on
 or
 maybe
 something
 you
 bought


two
 days
 ago,
 UiPath
 up
 3%.
 Is
 it
 worth


shaving
 a
 little
 bit
 off
 if
 the
 market's


giving
 you
 these
 types
 of
 chances?


And
 if
 you
 did,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 did.


I
 see
 a
 couple
 of
 people
 saying
 yes.


Too
 much
 for
 taxes.


Uh,
 no
 reason
 to
 trim.
 Not
 till


November.
 Trim
 Tesla
 at
 450
 at
 the
 open.


Okay,
 that
 was
 not
 a
 bad
 sell.


Not
 until
 earnings
 and
 rate
 cuts.
 Yeah,


that
 that's
 kind
 of
 my
 thesis
 on
 this
 as


well.
 It
 was
 a
 similar
 question
 to
 what


people
 are
 saying.
 When
 would
 you
 sell


SoFi?
 It's
 like,
 well,
 earnings
 are
 on


Tuesday,
 so
 not
 before
 earnings.
 And


then
 you
 have
 the
 rate
 cut
 the
 day


after.
 But
 but
 that's
 not
 just
 specific


to
 SoFi.
 That's
 every
 single
 growth


stock.
 Like
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a


if
 they're
 if
 you
 think
 they
 could
 have


good
 earnings
 like
 a
 Google
 and
 they're


getting
 a
 rate
 cut
 as
 well.
 I
 think


Google
 is
 after
 the
 rate
 cut.
 It's
 just


like


what
 exactly
 is
 the
 the
 super
 big
 logic


to
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 position?
 Now,


maybe
 you
 hedge
 a
 little
 bit
 by
 selling


some
 calls
 or
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 off


the
 table,
 but
 those
 two
 catalysts
 are


very
 important.
 S&P
 right
 there,
 677.


S&P
 677.


Trimmed
 some
 AMD.


Trimmed
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 AMD
 above
 250.


Just
 takes
 a
 tweet
 to
 lose
 it
 all
 again.


Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 the


thing
 that
 all
 of
 us
 are
 getting
 more


used
 to.
 It's
 like
 today's
 a
 pretty


euphoric
 day
 as
 long
 as
 this
 continues,


which
 I
 mean
 the
 momentum
 looks
 really


high
 today.


But
 it
 takes
 a
 tweet
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 it.


And
 you
 would
 just
 hope
 that
 we're
 kind


of
 done
 with
 some
 of
 those
 tweets.


Um,


yeah.
 No,
 we're
 seeing
 some
 pretty
 big


moves,
 bro.
 This
 stuff
 is
 not
 easily


going
 away.


Julian,
 thank
 you,
 brother,
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 Shout
 out


to
 Amid
 and
 everything
 he
 does
 for
 the


community.
 I
 give
 you
 your
 flowers
 for


giving
 your
 platform
 with
 so
 much


integrity,
 not
 gripping
 like
 every
 other


finance
 creator.
 You
 are
 a
 gem.


Everybody
 drop
 a
 thank
 you
 for
 it
 for


what
 he
 does
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out.
 He


gives
 the
 value
 and
 energy
 he
 gives
 for


free.
 Julian,
 appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 You
 do
 not
 need
 to


say
 that,
 but
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate


you
 being
 here.
 I
 know
 today's
 probably


a
 very
 fun
 day
 for
 your
 portfolio.
 We


were
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 Julian's
 videos


the
 other
 day
 and
 uh
 you
 October
 10th
 he


was
 down
 like
 5
 million.
 Couple
 weeks


later
 he
 was
 up
 5
 million.
 I
 would


imagine
 he's
 up
 a
 decent
 amount
 today.


But
 appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being


here.
 Oh,
 wow.
 That's
 a
 $540s
 super


chat.


Goodness
 gracious.
 I
 don't
 even
 know.


AED,


that's
 the
 United
 Arab
 Emirates.


Wow,


dude.
 I
 appreciate
 that,
 man.
 Thank
 you.


That's
 a
 big
 one.
 I
 I
 I
 deeply


appreciate
 that.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 man.


Shout
 out
 to
 the
 United
 Arab
 Emirates.


Shout
 out
 to
 them.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Yes,
 I
 know
 I
 said
 it
 wrong.
 Trolling.


I'm
 trolling.
 Emirati
 sounds
 better


though,
 right?
 That's
 the
 easier
 way
 to


say
 it.
 Emirates.
 Emirates
 sounds
 like


pirates,
 bro.
 Emiradis
 is
 like
 legit,


bro.
 It's
 legit.
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone's


ever
 sent
 a
 a
 Durham
 super
 chat.


United
 Arab
 Emirates
 Durham.
 Thank
 you,


Julian.
 Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Deeply,


deeply
 appreciate
 you.
 And
 uh
 today's


probably
 got
 to
 be
 a
 fun
 day
 for
 your


portfolio
 as
 well.
 So
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Robin
 Hood
 right
 there
 140.


We
 know
 Julian's
 a
 big
 Robin
 Hood


Palenter
 guy.
 Both
 of
 these
 names


massive
 massive
 days
 on
 the
 day
 up
 2.4


and
 4.7.
 You
 know
 that
 that
 that's
 why
 I


bought
 hood
 at
 17
 or
 pounder
 at
 172.
 I


mean
 like
 I
 know
 it's
 an
 expensive
 stock


here
 but
 I
 really
 do
 think
 they're
 going


to
 give
 one
 of
 those
 earnings
 that
 could


take
 this
 guy
 up
 to
 200
 and
 then
 if
 it


gets
 to
 200
 and
 normalizes
 200.


I
 mean
 I
 know
 it
 is
 expensive
 though.
 So


same
 thing
 with
 Hood.
 They're
 all


expensive.
 It's
 just
 if
 they
 could


deliver
 some
 earnings
 and
 the
 macros
 in


the
 right
 sector,
 you'd
 get
 some


momentto
 mirror.


Uh
 677
 on
 the
 S&P.
 That
 is
 green.


Julian,
 we
 are
 sorry
 this
 guy
 can't
 say


your
 country
 name
 right.
 I
 was
 trolling.


I
 wasn't
 trolling
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 when


I
 actually
 said
 Emirati,


but
 I
 was
 trolling
 today.


Uh
 you're
 getting
 some
 green.
 You're


getting
 some
 good
 green
 right
 here.


SMCI,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 think
 SMCI
 is
 crazy
 here
 at
 49.


They
 didn't
 really
 take
 away
 their


guidance.
 They
 just
 pushed
 it
 back
 a


quarter.
 So,
 SMCI
 47
 yesterday
 also


wasn't
 that
 bad.
 Cory
 right
 here,
 130.


That's
 up
 6%.
 And
 then
 Coinbase,
 look
 at


that.
 6.7%
 move
 on
 freaking
 Coinbase
 as


well.


Suriraj,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Happy
 CPI
 day.


Happy
 CPI
 day
 to
 all
 of
 us.
 I
 did
 did
 a


lot
 of
 people
 even
 remember
 we
 were


getting
 CPI
 today


cuz
 I
 didn't
 remember
 until
 it
 came
 out.


I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 crap,
 it's
 Friday.
 CPI


never
 comes
 out
 on
 a
 Friday
 and
 the


government
 shutdown."
 But
 that
 thing


just
 whips
 out
 all
 of
 us
 to
 the
 upside.


Deanna,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as


well.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Hoof,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Today
 is
 my


birthday
 and
 historically
 it's
 a


terrible
 day
 in
 the
 market,
 but
 today
 it


is
 celebrating
 with
 alltime
 highs.
 Hoof,


happy
 birthday.
 And
 what
 a
 birthday


president


with
 alltime
 highs.


What
 a
 freaking
 birthday
 present
 with


alltime
 highs.


Amazing.


Amazing.
 Amazing
 stuff.


That's
 the
 best
 thing
 you
 could
 ask
 for


your
 birthday,
 right?
 Like
 there's
 no


amount
 of
 money
 or
 gift
 that
 anyone


could
 give
 you
 in
 your
 life
 on
 your


birthday
 than
 the
 stock
 market
 on
 a
 new


all-time
 high
 on
 the
 S&P,
 right?
 Like


you
 will
 you
 there's
 just
 no
 gift
 that


could
 compare
 like
 numerically
 other


than
 the
 stock
 market
 hitting
 alltime


highs
 for
 your
 birthday.


S&P
 she's
 going
 for
 678.
 She's
 going
 for


it.


She
 is
 going
 for
 it.
 And
 maybe
 we're


going
 to
 see
 some
 green.
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


people
 saying


they
 didn't
 remember
 CPI.
 A
 couple
 of


you
 guys
 saying
 yes.


Yeah,
 I
 I
 genuinely
 woke
 up
 and
 I


forgot.
 This
 is
 a
 Friday
 usually.


Otherwise,
 I
 would
 have
 even
 been
 early


because
 usually
 CPI
 we
 we
 do
 it
 15


minutes
 early,
 but
 on
 a
 Friday
 it
 just


felt
 like
 it
 was
 all
 off.
 But
 it
 was
 a


great
 surprise
 right
 here.
 67764


on
 the
 S&P.


Um,


uh,
 unless
 you
 shorted
 the
 market.
 Yeah,


that
 was
 not
 the
 best
 either.


That
 was
 not
 the
 best
 either.
 10-year


Treasury
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 a
 bit
 up.


Are
 we
 green
 on
 that?
 Yeah.
 Oh,
 we're


back
 above.
 We're
 just
 under
 4%.
 So,
 you


got
 the
 tenure
 inching
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Not
 that
 concerning,
 but
 nonetheless,


you
 are
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.


Adam
 says,
 "Amit,
 my
 birthday
 is


tomorrow."
 Happy
 pre-birth
 to
 you,
 Adam.


Hopefully,
 you
 enjoy
 it.
 Yeah,
 we
 got
 a


lot
 of
 October
 babies.
 Shopify
 alltime


high.


Shopify.
 Wow.
 173
 on
 Shopify.


Shout
 out
 to
 Austin.
 He's
 in
 the
 chat.


He's
 been
 bullish
 Shopify
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Tanner.
 I
 think
 this


is
 his
 second
 largest
 position.
 Shopify


from
 Canada.
 Also,
 fix
 HVAC.


This
 company
 was
 up
 15%.
 This
 is
 another


one
 that
 Austin
 was
 talking
 about
 over


the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 Uh,
 apparently


HVAC
 matter
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 data


centers.
 That
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 growth


momentum
 play
 for
 them.
 S&P
 right
 there


677
 and
 then
 AMD
 250
 SoFi
 up
 5.2%.
 Nebas


ripping
 higher
 as
 well.
 Look
 at
 that.


Nebas
 8.2.
 I
 think
 what
 the
 draw
 down
 on


the
 data
 center
 names
 kind
 of
 showed


everybody
 is
 that
 if
 there
 is
 any
 level


of
 fragility
 in
 the
 in
 the
 uh
 data


center
 like
 narrative
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 are
 going to
 get
 hit
 really
 bad.


But
 as
 soon
 as
 that
 narrative
 dies
 out,


aka
 Oracle
 financing
 $40
 billion
 of


debt,
 you
 just
 need
 one
 headline
 to


change
 everything.
 And
 the
 headline
 from


Oracle
 was
 enough
 and
 then
 boom,
 Nebius,


Core
 Weave,
 all
 these
 names,
 they're


back
 to
 green.


They
 are
 back
 to
 green.


Yeah,
 BMR
 is
 stuck
 unfortunately
 because


Ethereum
 is
 not
 really
 moving.
 If


Ethereum
 joins,
 this
 can
 really
 get
 fun.


But
 both
 Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin


just
 not
 moving
 as
 much
 this
 this
 month.


Um,


Cipher,
 are
 we
 still
 moving
 on
 Cipher?


Yeah,
 12%.
 There
 you
 go.


Hims,
 where
 is
 HIMS?


Hims
 is
 back
 above
 50.
 Okay,
 we're
 at


least
 back
 above
 50
 on
 HIMS.
 Western


Union,
 they
 did
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 Western
 Union
 is
 up
 10%.
 You


know,
 we
 talked
 about
 Western
 Union
 like


a
 month
 ago.


who
 brought
 one
 of
 someone
 brought
 it
 up


and
 I
 I
 shared
 them
 speaking
 about
 the


thesis.
 I
 think
 it
 might
 have
 been
 Josh


Brown.
 Uh
 again,
 it
 it's
 hard
 to
 invest


in
 kind
 of
 the
 legacy
 financial


infrastructure
 on
 money
 payments,
 but


this
 one
 did
 have
 a
 decent
 earnings.
 By


the
 way,
 speaking
 of
 Josh
 Brown,
 his


latest
 pick
 that
 he
 likes
 is
 Zoom.


Zoom
 up
 2.4%.
 He
 is
 a
 fan
 of
 Zoom.


He
 thinks
 that
 their
 enterprise
 business


can
 get
 rerated
 on
 a
 variety
 of


different
 verticals.


I
 think
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hard


stretch
 to
 see
 it
 get
 rerated,
 but
 maybe


zooms
 right
 there
 is
 at
 8489.


Oh
 yeah,
 he
 did
 say
 insiders
 were
 buying


a
 ton
 of
 Western
 Union.
 Yeah,
 that
 was


his
 thesis.
 I
 forgot.
 That's
 why
 I


showed
 it.
 I
 remember
 that.
 I
 showed
 it


because
 the
 insider
 buying
 was
 crazy.


Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.
 August
 couple


million
 worth
 of
 buys


on
 Western
 Union.


Zoom
 is
 not
 interesting.
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 Zoom
 is
 growing


literally
 2%.
 Like,
 for
 them
 to
 really


change
 that
 growth,
 which
 technically


that's
 the
 bull
 case,
 right?
 If
 you're


only
 growing
 2%,
 how
 hard
 is
 it
 to
 grow


5%,
 10%.
 But
 still,
 it's
 like
 there's


not
 as
 many
 use
 cases
 for
 the
 product,


even
 though
 Josh
 thinks
 there's
 are
 more


use
 cases,
 and
 you
 would
 have
 to
 see
 a


lot
 more
 of
 those
 to
 to
 get
 a
 change.


Okay,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 find
 this
 Funstrat


quote.
 Um,
 if
 anyone
 has
 it,
 let
 me
 see


it.
 People
 are
 saying,
 "Funstrat
 says


correction
 in
 November."


I
 think
 that
 might
 be
 Mark
 Newton
 saying


that
 from
 a
 technical
 perspective.


which
 is
 very
 possible
 because
 he
 was
 a


bit
 more
 bearish


uh
 two
 weeks
 ago.


Um


yeah,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 see
 their
 exact


prediction
 on
 that,
 but


they
 potentially
 think
 we
 might
 get
 a


correction
 going
 into
 November.
 I
 don't


see
 the
 exact
 quote
 on
 it,
 though.
 Mark


said
 it.


Let
 me
 see.
 Was
 Mark
 live
 yesterday?


Is
 Mark
 live?


Um,


I
 got
 to
 see.
 I
 got
 to
 try
 to
 find
 it.


Wasn't
 October
 enough.
 So,
 Tom
 and
 Mark


don't
 agree.
 No,
 I
 think
 they
 agree


macro
 by
 end
 of
 year
 is
 going
 to
 be


good,
 but
 they
 might
 think
 November
 is


not
 the
 best.
 I
 would
 be
 I
 just
 I'm


curious
 to
 see
 why
 they
 think
 November,


especially
 after
 this
 draw
 down
 we
 got,


why
 they
 think
 November
 could
 get
 hit.


Um,


I'm
 not
 sure.
 Not
 sure
 right
 here.
 Let


me
 see.
 I
 think
 is
 this
 the
 video?


Okay,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 I
 think
 this


might
 be
 it.


uh
 thought
 of
 as
 being
 a
 big
 surprise


just
 given
 the
 overlapping
 nature
 of


what
 we've
 seen.
 Uh
 even
 though
 I
 do


suspect
 that
 the
 move
 from
 the
 10th
 last


Friday
 into
 the
 15th
 uh
 was
 very
 strong.


Um
 you
 know
 we
 can
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of


choppiness
 near
 term
 and
 still
 be


bullish.
 Where
 that
 changes
 of
 course
 is


a
 move
 down
 under
 6550.
 So
 for
 those


that
 are
 negative
 that's
 really
 what
 you


need
 to
 really
 have
 a
 concern.
 For
 now
 a


lot
 of
 this
 so-called
 rotation
 uh
 really


isn't
 that
 negative
 or
 doesn't
 need
 to


be.
 and
 if
 anything
 can
 still
 help
 S&P


uh
 turn
 higher
 uh
 into
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 meeting
 or
 in
 the
 event
 that
 we


would
 go
 sideways
 for
 another
 week
 uh


likely
 would
 start
 to
 turn
 up
 very


sharply
 after
 a
 POW
 speech
 uh
 in
 late


October.
 Uh
 bottom
 line,
 I
 I
 don't
 find


a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 to
 be
 too
 negative
 just


given
 that
 this
 longer
 term
 trend
 has


not
 shown
 any
 evidence
 of
 damage


specifically
 when
 we
 have
 stocks
 like


Apple.


>> Okay,
 I
 think
 I
 have
 the
 exact
 video.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up.
 the
 market
 is
 going


to
 close
 in
 2025.
 This
 is
 this
 is


amazing
 what
 we're
 seeing.


>> I
 think
 we
 close
 at
 7,000.


>> Okay,


>> I'm
 bullish
 for
 the
 next
 couple
 months.


However,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 correction
 in
 November.
 Um


there's
 several
 things
 that
 are
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 problem.
 Technology
 has
 moved


straight
 up,
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 market


has
 not.
 So,
 the
 Ecoated
 S&P
 is


unchanged
 since
 July.
 No
 movement.


>> Eventually,
 that
 needs
 to
 change.
 We


need
 to
 see
 a
 broad-based
 move
 or
 else


the
 market
 is
 susceptible
 and
 vulnerable


to
 a
 possible
 pullback.
 We
 also
 see
 that


positioning
 and
 deal
 making
 is
 is


rapidly
 gone
 on
 the
 rise.
 Last
 month
 was


the
 biggest
 month
 in
 US
 M&A
 mergers
 and


acquisitions
 in
 25
 years.
 It's
 amazing,


but
 it's
 like
 where
 has
 this
 been
 all


this
 time?
 The
 market's
 already
 up
 35%


and
 now
 people
 are
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


getting
 starting
 turning
 the
 switch
 and


starting
 to
 do
 deal
 making.
 Um,
 to
 the


bull's
 credit,
 sentiment
 is
 still
 not


all
 that
 optimistic,
 and
 I
 think
 that's


a
 good
 thing
 for
 the
 market
 in
 general,


but
 I
 do
 worry
 that
 breath
 and
 momentum


have
 started
 to
 slide
 a
 little
 bit.


Technology
 has
 gone
 straight
 up.
 There's


several
 pockets
 of
 speculation
 in
 the


metals,
 in
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners,
 and
 the


quantum
 stocks,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 can


get
 too
 bearish
 to
 yet
 just
 yet.
 So
 I
 I


think
 we
 have
 to
 stick
 with
 the
 trend


but
 recognize
 that
 we
 probably
 will
 get


some
 type
 of
 a
 backing
 and
 filling
 which


I
 think
 starts
 at
 the
 end
 of
 October


near
 6,800.
 We
 pull
 back
 a
 little
 bit


and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 buy
 dips
 into
 the


middle
 part
 of
 November
 for
 a
 big
 move


to
 finish
 on
 a
 high
 note.


>> So
 they
 recorded
 this
 on
 October
 16th.


That's
 when
 the
 S&P
 was
 at
 6
 uh
 660.


Uh
 we
 did
 have
 again
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 choppy


time
 since
 then.
 And
 now
 S&P's
 at
 677.


I
 don't
 think
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 is


inconsistent
 with
 what
 they
 believe


already,
 which
 is
 S&P
 end
 of
 year
 7,000.


He
 literally
 said
 680
 and
 then
 a
 draw


down
 that
 you
 buy
 the
 dip
 on.
 I
 mean,
 if


we
 tap
 680
 by
 the
 end
 of
 October
 and


then
 we
 have
 a
 draw
 down
 in
 November,


uh,
 at least
 for
 the
 first
 couple
 weeks,


that
 would
 support
 his
 thesis,


especially
 going
 into
 earning
 season


because
 then
 if
 you
 buy
 the
 dip
 on
 that,


it
 sets
 up
 7,000.
 or
 we
 see
 the
 exact


opposite
 and
 the
 draw
 down
 that
 did


happen
 673
 to
 647
 I
 think
 was
 the
 exact


draw
 down
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


that
 is
 over
 that
 is
 done
 and
 we
 resume


the
 uptrend
 I
 mean
 obviously
 no
 one
 can


predict
 this
 stuff
 but
 he
 did
 say
 until


mid
 November


you
 might
 see
 that
 end
 up
 happening


we're
 going
 to
 see
 overall
 you
 know


whether
 it
 happens
 on
 a
 technical


retracement
 or
 whether
 it
 happens
 on


something
 fundamental.
 If
 it
 ends
 up


being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip,
 by
 the
 way,
 fear


and
 greed
 right
 here
 at
 34.
 So
 far,


buying
 the
 dip
 has
 worked
 out
 across
 the


board.
 Buying
 the
 dip
 has
 worked
 out.


Iran
 is
 up
 10%.


Um


S&P
 still
 moving


and
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more.
 Yeah,
 he


said
 correction.
 So
 he
 would
 be


expecting,
 you
 know,
 5
 to
 7%


if
 we
 do
 get
 that,
 which
 look,
 if
 we
 get


to
 6,800
 and
 then
 we
 get
 a
 5%
 correction


going
 into
 the
 end
 of the
 year,
 that


that's
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 probably


would
 be
 panicking,
 which
 is
 where
 I


think
 they
 would
 be
 buyers.


But
 especially
 because
 we're
 getting


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 but
 I


wonder
 if
 that's
 kind
 of
 ultimately
 how


it
 plays
 out.
 Or
 was
 this
 the
 draw
 down?


I
 mean, this
 is
 what
 I
 asked
 in
 the


morning,
 right?
 Is
 this
 the
 did
 the
 draw


down
 happen?
 Did
 we
 live
 through
 the


draw
 down
 over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 where


everything
 got
 wrecked?
 And
 maybe


everything
 doesn't
 get
 back
 to
 exactly


the
 all-time
 highs
 it
 was
 at.
 You
 know,


maybe
 Hood
 doesn't
 get
 to
 150
 easily.


But
 Hood
 back
 at
 140
 from
 120
 definitely


had
 took
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 beating
 at
 120.
 So


if
 it's
 not
 going
 back
 to
 120,
 maybe


it's
 not
 going
 back
 to
 150
 either.
 But


staying
 in
 the
 middle
 at
 140
 is
 I
 don't


think
 people
 are
 too
 upset
 about
 that.


Nvidia
 right
 here
 184.
 Amcar,
 did
 we


break
 33?
 Amcore,


nice
 breaking
 33.
 Cool.
 There
 you
 go.


Intel
 earnings
 definitely
 helps
 on
 that.


Broadcom
 helps.
 Amcore
 right
 there
 at


33.
 Intel
 is
 down.
 Intel
 losing
 a
 lot
 of


its
 momentum.
 So,
 you
 got
 some
 sellers


coming
 in.


Then
 Broadcom
 that's
 at
 352.


You
 could
 sell
 some
 aggressive
 calls
 on


that.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 do
 get
 a


November
 hit,
 maybe
 that
 is


not
 the
 worst
 thing.
 Uh,
 yeah.
 Booze


Allen
 Hamilton,
 dude,
 this
 was
 horrible.


This
 was
 an
 absolutely
 disgusting


earnings.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 Douggee,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 gifted
 five.
 Appreciate
 you


being
 here,
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the


gifted
 five
 membership.
 Nick
 Hill,
 thank


you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member.
 I


see,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 20
 bucks.
 Thanks


for
 making
 investment
 entertaining
 and


very
 informative
 every
 day.
 Keep
 up
 the


good
 work.
 I
 see.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 And
 Douggee,
 thank
 you
 as
 well
 for


the
 gifted
 memberships.
 I
 was
 looking
 at


Booze
 Allen
 Hamilton
 this
 morning.
 It


really
 does
 feel
 like
 Pounder
 is
 eating


their
 lunch.
 I
 mean,
 the
 report
 is
 kind


of
 crazy,
 bro.
 The
 report
 is
 kind
 of


crazy.
 They
 specifically
 said
 that
 they


are
 losing
 key
 contracts.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this.
 Here
 are
 some
 quotes.
 The


reaceleration
 of
 our
 business
 will
 take


longer
 than
 expected,
 and
 we
 are


lowering
 top
 and
 bottom
 line
 guidance


for
 the
 year.
 This
 is
 the
 most


bifurcated
 environment
 I've
 seen
 in
 my


decade
 with
 Booze
 Allen.
 Our
 civil


business
 is
 operating
 in
 the
 most


challenging
 market
 in
 a
 generation.


Almost
 90%
 of
 our
 7.2
 billion
 in
 gross


bookings
 in
 the
 na
 in
 the
 quarter
 were


from
 national
 security.
 Our
 focus
 of
 the


civil
 business
 is
 to
 maximize
 our
 AI


capabilities
 and
 commercialize
 our


technology
 partnerships
 to
 reignite


growth.
 Aka
 we
 are
 overly
 reliant
 on
 the


US
 government
 and
 the
 US
 government
 is


not
 giving
 us
 as
 much
 of
 a
 deal
 or
 as


much
 of
 a
 string
 of
 deals
 as
 we
 thought


we
 were
 going
 to
 get
 which
 is
 why
 we're


lowering
 our
 guidance
 and
 as
 a
 result


it's
 creating
 a
 more
 bifrocated


environment.


I
 mean,
 if
 if
 that's
 not
 Palanteer


eating
 a
 a
 legacy
 consulting
 firm's


lunch,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 is.
 This
 is


Accenture,
 by
 the
 way,
 said
 basically


the
 same
 thing.
 They
 have
 a
 little
 bit


more
 GI
 revenue
 to
 to
 to
 cushion
 some
 of


the
 pain.
 But
 Accenture
 year
 to
 date


down
 30%.


Booze
 Allen
 Hamilton
 year-to-
 date
 down


29%.
 I
 mean,
 all
 these
 consult


consulting
 firms,
 this
 is
 we're
 kind
 of


seeing
 the
 bloodbath
 of
 AI
 take
 some
 of


the
 lunch
 from
 the
 white
 collar
 jobs.


where
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 companies
 are


realizing
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 pay


consultants
 if
 we
 have
 something
 like
 an


AIP
 like
 why
 do
 we
 need
 consulting
 firms


and
 you
 might
 be
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of


weakness
 there
 Tesla
 right
 there
 down


1.6
 6
 pound
 here
 184
 is
 that's
 green.


I
 don't know
 if
 I
 was
 short
 booze
 Allen


Hamilton
 especially
 down
 30%
 but


you
 know
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year
 it


definitely
 was
 susceptible
 some
 of
 to


some
 of
 the
 problems
 with
 AI.
 Uh
 Trump


tweeted
 two
 hours
 ago
 the
 stock
 market


is
 stronger
 than
 ever
 because
 of


tariffs.


He
 tweeted
 that
 at
 7:30.


So
 Trump
 bullish
 on
 the
 markets
 right


here.
 SoFi
 2941


still
 holding
 up
 green.


Okay,
 we
 got
 some
 news
 from
 Amazon.


Amazon
 says
 the
 AWS
 outage
 started


because
 a
 of
 a
 bug
 in
 its
 automation


software
 where
 its
 AWS
 customers
 store


their
 data
 which
 then
 triggered
 more


issues
 in
 its
 other
 systems
 that
 relied


on
 their
 software.


Okay,
 so
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 update
 from


Amazon


on
 why


things
 did
 not
 work
 out
 the
 best.
 By
 the


way,
 Vlad
 also
 publicly
 commented
 on
 the


AWS
 shutdown.
 So,
 someone
 said,
 "Can
 we


for
 a
 second
 appreciate
 how
 Robinet
 took


no
 responsibility
 for
 being
 down?


However,
 it
 was
 Robin
 Hood
 that
 decided


to
 run
 from
 a
 single
 AWS
 region."
 And


then
 someone
 said,


someone
 said
 right
 here,
 I
 heard
 that


even
 if
 you
 were
 multi-reion,
 a
 bunch
 of


internal
 AWS
 stuff
 depended
 on
 the
 east


region
 anyway
 and
 you
 were
 half
 half


borked
 either
 way,
 it
 was
 effectively
 a


global
 AWS
 outage
 that
 made
 it
 so
 bad.


And
 Vlad
 said,
 "This
 is
 accurate.


So
 basically
 he's
 saying
 or
 implying


that
 they
 had
 multiple
 distributed


servers
 across
 the
 country.
 It
 wasn't


just
 in
 one
 region
 but
 because


everything
 relies
 so
 much
 on
 US1
 East


that's
 why
 it
 wrecked
 pretty
 much


everything
 else


which
 again
 technically
 you
 know
 Robin


Hood
 ultimately
 has
 responsibility
 but


maybe
 you
 can't
 blame
 Snapchat,


Coinbase,
 Robin
 Hood,
 Slack
 all
 those


companies
 themselves
 based
 on
 AWS.
 SoFi


right
 there
 2930.
 Amazon
 still
 at
 223.


Vlad
 should
 reply
 with
 why
 are
 you
 gay?


Dude,
 see
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 about
 Vlad


compared
 to
 Elon.
 Like
 Elon
 has
 FU
 money


and
 he
 also
 just
 doesn't
 care.
 And
 I


mean
 Vlad
 also
 has
 FU
 money,
 but
 Elon's


just,
 you
 know,
 Elon
 500
 billion's


different.
 Elon's
 telling
 the
 Secretary


of
 Transportation,
 "Why
 are
 you
 gay
 for


freaking
 not
 giving
 SpaceX
 the
 the


contract
 and
 opening
 it
 up
 to
 be


multiple
 competitors?"


And
 it
 just
 like
 like
 no
 other
 public


CEO
 would
 start
 a
 beef
 with
 the
 guy


that's
 supposed
 to
 give
 him
 the


contract.
 But
 Elon
 doesn't
 care.


Elon
 legit
 does
 not
 care.
 Speaking
 of


Elon,
 by
 the
 way,
 who
 thinks
 who
 thinks


that
 the
 video
 I'm
 about
 to
 play
 was


Elon
 Musk?


>> And
 a
 friend
 of
 mine,
 talking
 about


donors,
 a
 friend
 of
 mine,
 a
 man
 that's


great.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 use
 his
 name


unless
 he
 lets
 me
 do
 it.
 Uh
 Susie
 can


tell
 you
 about
 this,
 but
 he
 was
 uh
 he


called
 us
 the
 other
 day
 and
 he
 said,


"I'd
 like
 to
 contribute
 any
 shortfall


you
 have
 because
 of
 the
 Democrat


shutdown.
 Uh,
 I'd
 like
 to
 contribute


personally
 contribute
 any
 shortfall
 you


have
 with
 the
 military
 because
 I
 love


the
 military
 and
 I
 love
 the
 country
 and


any
 shortfall
 if
 there's
 a
 shortfall


I'll
 contribute
 it.
 And
 today
 he
 sent
 us


a
 check
 for
 $130


million.
 Do


>> you
 share
 who
 that
 is?


I
 would
 love
 to
 tell
 you
 he
 deserves
 he


doesn't
 really
 want
 the
 recognition
 if


you
 want
 to
 know
 the
 truth
 but
 he
 gave


us
 a
 check
 for
 $130
 million


>> and
 that's
 going
 to
 go


>> which
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 shortfall.
 Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 military.


Yeah.


>> And
 what's
 your
 message?


>> A
 friend
 of
 mine
 talking
 about


>> that's
 crazy,
 right?
 There
 was
 a


billionaire
 who
 gave
 Trump
 130
 million


to
 pay
 the
 troops
 during
 the
 shutdown.


I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 Karp
 because
 I


think
 I
 think
 I
 I
 given
 how
 much
 they


work
 with
 the
 government,
 I
 feel
 like


there's
 too
 much
 controversy
 for
 him
 to


make
 that
 type
 of
 donation.


Um,


then
 again,
 Elon
 also
 works
 heavily
 with


the
 government
 with
 SpaceX.
 So,
 I
 mean,


who
 knows?
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 got
 to
 be


someone
 who's
 worth
 many
 many
 tens
 of


billions.
 I
 don't know
 if
 you
 could
 be


like
 a
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 could
 have
 a


couple
 billion
 if
 you
 can
 give
 away
 130


million.
 You
 got
 to
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to


be
 at least
 20
 billion
 to
 be
 able
 to


think
 of
 giving
 away
 130
 million.
 But


that's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 right?
 Someone


agrees
 with
 Trump
 so
 much
 on
 this


government
 shutdown
 that
 they
 literally


paid
 for
 the
 salaries
 for
 the
 troops
 the


tune
 of
 130
 million
 because
 they
 wanted


the
 shutdown
 to
 continue
 and
 for
 you


know
 Trump
 to
 achieve
 his
 agenda.
 It's


quite
 incredible.


But
 you
 know
 he's
 got
 the
 the


connections
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 business


people
 which
 is
 why
 this
 happens.


Allison
 Palmer
 Lucky.
 It
 was
 not
 me.
 I


can
 confirm
 it's
 not
 me.
 Yeah,
 CZ.
 I


mean,
 CZ
 got
 a
 uh
 pardon
 yesterday
 in


the
 crypto
 world.
 He's
 worth
 80
 billion


bucks,


which,
 you
 know,
 it's
 hard
 to


potentially
 deny
 that
 he
 did
 also
 just


get
 a
 pardon.
 You
 got
 to
 also
 imagine


someone
 had
 some
 You
 gota
 imagine


someone
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 like,
 hey,


you
 know,
 maybe
 it
 was
 fully
 altruistic


or
 maybe
 it
 was
 like,
 well,
 under
 30


million
 in
 the
 long
 term
 is
 going
 to
 pay


me
 back
 later.
 Maybe.
 Tesla
 right
 there


down
 2.2.
 Tesla
 one
 of
 the
 only
 names


that's
 actually
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 GameStop


a
 little bit.
 Disney
 a
 little
 bit.
 Intel


holding
 1%.
 Everything
 else,
 Dolingo


even
 is
 up
 1.4.


I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 Triple
 V.


I
 think
 I
 honestly
 Larry
 Ellison
 to
 me


seems
 like
 the
 the
 the
 easiest
 guest,


but
 then
 again,


I
 don't
 know.
 You
 gota
 have
 a
 lot
 of


money
 and
 you
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 easily


give
 it
 away.


This
 is
 how
 you
 do
 government
 charity.


Don't
 force
 the
 government
 to
 raise


taxes
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 a
 program
 funded


yourself.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 you
 talk
 about


people
 complaining
 about
 taxes
 and
 then


boom,
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 some
 people
 that


will
 just
 give
 away
 all
 this
 money.
 Now


granted,
 it
 could
 be
 it
 could
 probably
 a


tax
 write
 off
 for
 whoever
 gave
 it
 away.


So
 they
 are
 saving
 something
 on
 the
 back


end.


I
 feel
 like
 the
 best
 guess
 is
 around


Ellison,
 Elon,
 maybe
 Karp
 or
 some
 of


those.


Um
 I
 don't
 know if
 Joe
 Lonzil
 is
 worth


enough
 to
 give
 away
 130
 million.
 Again,


I
 think
 you
 got
 to
 be
 worth
 10
 to
 20


billion
 to
 be
 able
 to
 part
 with
 a
 couple


percentage
 points
 of
 your
 entire
 net


worth.
 probably
 more
 than
 that.
 You


know,
 like
 if
 you're
 worth
 100
 billion,


130
 is
 like
 whatever.
 If
 you're
 worth
 10


billion,
 130
 is
 still
 130
 million.


Tanner
 says,
 "It
 wasn't
 me.
 Trump
 is
 mad


at
 me."
 Exactly,
 dude.
 Tanner,
 what
 did


you
 guys
 do
 to
 piss
 off
 Trump
 like
 this,


bro?
 You
 guys
 pissed
 him
 off.


Absolutely
 freaking
 pissed
 him
 off.


It
 was
 Ken
 Griffin.
 You
 know,
 Ken


Griffin's
 not
 been
 the
 biggest
 fan
 of


Trump.
 He's
 not
 like
 Rah
 Ro.
 He's


actually
 criticized
 the
 tariffs


aggressively,
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it


would
 easily
 be
 Ken
 Griffin,


but
 it
 would
 have
 to
 be
 someone
 that
 has


some
 money.
 Um,
 okay,
 let's
 get
 some


updates
 right
 here
 on
 the
 crypto
 news.


We
 talked
 about
 JP
 Morgan
 thinking
 of


Bitcoin
 and
 ETH
 as
 collateral.
 Here's


some
 coverage


on
 what
 we
 have
 there.
 JP
 Morgan's


trading
 business
 has
 for
 a
 few
 months


now
 accepted
 IBIT,
 the
 ETF,
 as
 a
 form
 of


collateral,
 which
 it
 sees
 as
 less


volatile
 as
 the
 underlying
 currencies.


However,
 I'm
 told
 that
 certain
 hedge


fund
 managers
 and
 asset
 managers
 are


demanding
 more
 of
 these
 types
 of
 crypto


services.
 Although
 again,
 I'm
 told
 that


offering
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ether
 as
 collateral


for
 trading
 is
 not
 imminent.
 While
 many


remember
 JP
 Morgan
 chairman
 and
 CEO
 Jaie


Diamond's
 comments
 about
 Bitcoin
 being
 a


pet
 rock,
 he's
 moderated
 his
 tone


recently.
 Here's
 what
 he
 said
 when
 I


asked
 him
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 about
 the


firm's
 increasing
 overlap
 with
 crypto,


including
 a
 Coinbase
 partnership
 and
 the


stable
 coin
 like
 token
 JPMD.


>> I'm
 not
 against
 stable
 coins
 like
 a


mutual
 fund,
 you
 know,
 but
 mutual
 funds


have
 rules.
 What
 are
 the
 rules
 going
 to


be
 around
 stable
 coins?
 and
 the
 you
 I


think
 there
 are
 really
 so
 I'm
 a
 believer


in
 stable
 coin
 a
 believer
 in
 blockchain


not
 personally
 a
 believer
 in
 bitcoin


itself
 but
 you're
 the
 customer
 you
 know


I
 don't
 like
 to
 tell
 customers
 what
 they


can
 and
 can't
 do
 with
 their
 money
 that


that
 is
 a
 whole
 different
 issue
 for
 us


and
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 accommodate
 those


things
 if
 the
 customers
 want
 to
 use
 it


and
 how
 they
 use
 it
 and
 it's
 used


properly
 we'll
 be
 doing
 it
 what
 the


customer
 wants
 is
 not
 what
 JP
 Morgan


personally
 wants


>> JP
 Morgan
 declining
 to
 comment
 but
 this


is
 a
 space
 to
 watch
 because
 although
 it


is
 early
 days
 and
 so
 far
 somewhat


isolated
 to
 the
 trading
 group,
 it
 could


ultimately
 potentially
 we'll
 see
 expand


to
 other
 areas
 of
 the
 business.
 They've


got
 a
 very
 sprawling
 business
 whether


it's
 corporate
 or
 asset
 management
 or


even
 consumer.
 But
 again,
 still
 early


days
 here
 in
 reserve
 for
 that
 trading


business,
 guys.


>> Yeah.


All
 right.
 IBIT
 and
 Ethereum
 ETFs


looking
 like
 they
 will
 officially
 be


collateralized,
 guys.
 We're
 still


holding
 some
 pretty
 good
 levels
 right


here.
 S&P
 losing
 677
 but
 barely


almost
 broke
 678.
 If
 we
 even
 I
 mean


again
 67395
 was
 the
 previous
 all-time


high.
 If
 we
 even
 hold
 anywhere
 above


that
 to
 close
 out
 the
 Friday


that
 would
 be
 nice.


Uh
 Google
 260
 close
 out
 even
 above
 257


that'd
 be
 bullish.
 Nvidia
 holding
 the


180s.
 Palinger
 holding
 184.
 I
 mean
 Robin


at
 anything
 above
 135
 I
 think
 would
 be


bullish.
 You're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of these


names
 that
 are
 just
 holding
 on
 to
 levels


that
 they
 were
 at
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.


Not
 officially
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 still,


you
 know,
 still
 doing
 okay.


Iran
 up
 nine.
 Cipher
 up
 12.


Yeah,
 you're
 getting
 these
 names.
 Not


really
 getting
 hit
 yet.
 We
 didn't
 really


even
 have
 a
 10.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 10:30.


Maybe
 we
 get
 through
 a
 10:30
 slam
 right


now.
 Even
 look,
 look
 at
 the
 regionals.


The
 regionals
 caused
 so
 so
 much


kurfuffle
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days


about
 private
 credit.
 No
 one
 cares.


Regionals
 are
 up.
 KRE
 is
 literally
 back


to
 where
 it
 was
 the
 day
 the
 Zion's


charge
 off
 came
 out
 and
 it
 tanked
 9%.


It's
 right
 back
 to
 it.
 Up
 12%
 in
 the


past
 six
 months.
 Like


private
 credit's
 not
 the
 issue.
 AI
 capex


not
 the
 issue
 as
 per
 Oracle.
 Earnings
 so


far
 not
 the
 issue.
 Tesla
 and
 Netflix
 not


the
 best
 earnings
 but
 definitely
 not


some
 like
 horrendous
 earnings.
 Um
 and


again
 Netflix
 would
 have
 beat
 if
 it


wasn't
 for
 the
 Brazilian
 tax
 authority


charge
 and
 then
 CPI
 was
 better
 than


expected.
 Like
 where
 where
 is
 the
 bare


case?


Now
 the
 only
 thing
 I
 think
 we
 can
 comp


we
 can
 point
 to
 is
 momentum
 draw
 down


which
 again
 we
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 and


and
 that
 that's
 not
 the
 momentum
 draw


down
 was
 not
 bearish.
 That
 was
 healthy.


It
 was
 healthy
 for
 Oakllo
 to
 not
 be


stuck
 at
 a,
 you
 know,
 $
 35
 billion


market
 cap.
 And
 now
 Oakllo
 is
 back
 at
 a


what
 market
 cap
 is
 that
 at?
 20
 billion.


I
 mean,
 look,
 like,
 yeah,
 20
 billion
 is


still
 aggressive
 for
 a
 company
 with
 no


revenue,
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 crazy.
 I


mean,
 it
 might
 still
 be
 crazy
 euphoric,


but
 it's
 not
 still
 crazy
 crazy
 euphoric.


That
 level
 of
 flush
 out,
 I
 think,
 was


actually
 really
 healthy
 for
 the
 for
 the


market
 to
 breathe
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 to


have
 a
 move
 to
 go
 higher.


with
 alltime
 highs.
 Why
 is
 Verizon
 at


year
 lows?
 Because
 I
 mean,
 why
 would
 you


buy
 Verizon
 when
 rates
 are
 coming
 down


and
 growth
 is
 up,
 right?
 Like
 that's


Verizon
 to
 me
 is
 you
 buy
 it
 to
 get
 yield


and
 you
 buy
 it
 in
 case
 there's
 weakness


in
 other
 like
 yeah,
 if
 we
 have
 a


recession,
 people
 are
 not
 going to
 be


trading
 on
 Coinbase.
 So
 Coinbase
 is


going
 to
 get
 nuked,
 but
 people
 are
 not


going
 to
 cancel
 their
 phone
 bill.
 So


Verizon
 is
 not
 even
 just
 a
 hedge,
 but


it's
 something
 to
 safe
 to
 be
 in.
 But
 if


if
 people
 are
 trading
 Bitcoin
 on


Coinbase
 and
 Coinbase
 is
 getting
 more


transaction
 volumes,
 then
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 from
 an
 opportunity
 perspective


being
 stuck
 in
 Verizon
 versus
 a


Coinbase,
 I'm
 using
 Coinbase
 as
 an


example,
 it's
 a
 pretty
 big
 opportunity


cost.


So
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 value
 names,
 they're


they're
 not
 really
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 bit,


especially
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this
 when
 CPI


is
 better
 than
 expected.


What
 what
 what
 do
 we
 think
 is
 the
 bare


case?
 because


I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 need
 to
 kind
 of


analyze
 that
 deeply.


Again,
 AI
 capex,
 that's
 why
 AMD
 is
 going


to
 the
 moon
 today.
 Oracle
 just
 showed


there's
 more
 demand
 than
 expected.
 CPI


way
 better
 than
 expected.
 Not
 way


better,
 but
 better,
 which
 is
 good.


Earnings
 growth
 strong.


Uh,


I
 mean,
 crypto
 has
 been
 relatively
 flat,


but
 I
 also
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 bullish


because
 they
 should
 be
 coiling
 up
 and


setting
 up
 for
 a
 good
 end
 of
 year.


And
 then
 momentum
 draw
 down
 names,
 even


if
 they
 don't
 continue
 to
 draw
 down,
 you


know,
 they're
 not
 at
 all-time
 highs


anymore.
 And
 so,
 you
 just
 and
 and
 a
 lot


of
 that
 liquidity
 probably
 left
 some
 of


those
 names.
 I
 mean,
 Douggee
 is
 a
 prime


example.
 Douggee
 took
 some
 quantum


profits.
 He's
 probably
 going
 to
 deploy


some
 of
 that
 money
 into
 an
 Amazon
 or


something,
 right?
 Or
 into
 into
 something


else.
 And
 so
 those
 other
 names
 that
 are


a
 bit
 more
 fundamental,
 you
 know,
 they


might
 get
 some
 of
 that
 liquidity
 and


that
 could
 continue
 to
 get
 those
 to
 go


higher
 as
 well.


Bare
 cases,
 inflated
 revenue,
 everyone


passing
 money
 around.


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 a
 macro
 AI
 bear
 case.


I'm
 thinking
 more
 so
 like
 structurally


what
 gets
 us
 to
 take
 a
 big
 hit.
 Also,
 I


didn't
 even
 mention
 the
 China
 stuff
 has


been
 it's
 not
 resolved,
 but
 like
 it's


definitely
 not
 escalated
 over
 the
 past


two
 weeks.


Any
 good
 news
 we
 get
 from
 China,
 any
 new


good
 news
 we
 get
 from
 Russia,
 Ukraine,


we
 already
 have
 the
 pseudo
 peace
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 stuff
 that
 has
 been
 at least


relatively
 tamed
 over
 the
 past
 two


weeks,
 all
 of
 those
 are
 tailwinds
 again


for
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Doug
 says,
 "Amit
 that's
 exactly
 what
 I


did.
 I
 bought
 a
 bunch
 of
 Amazon."
 Yeah,


there
 I
 mean


took
 six
 figures
 of
 profits


from
 names
 that
 were
 a
 bit
 more
 momentum


driven
 and
 threw
 it
 into
 something
 that


has
 done
 nothing
 all
 year
 like
 Amazon.


Like
 I
 feel
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 over


the
 past
 two
 weeks
 did
 that.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 people
 took
 some
 profits
 and
 and


may
 you
 know
 maybe
 they
 took
 some
 of


those
 profits
 because
 they
 just
 didn't


know
 where
 the
 bottom
 was.
 Retail


psychology
 takes
 over
 when
 something's


down
 30%
 in
 a
 week.
 You
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 like
 dude
 I'm
 up
 a
 lot.
 I


should
 probably
 take
 some
 off
 the
 table


and
 then
 redeploy


and
 and and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 if
 that's


taking
 place
 then


it
 only
 adds
 to
 more
 bullish
 momentum


and
 it
 continues
 to
 prove
 that
 retail


you
 know
 is
 not
 just
 stupid
 money
 buying


stupid
 stuff.
 It's
 like
 no
 retail
 is


able
 to
 take
 profits
 and
 put
 money
 into


different
 areas


which
 is
 important.


AMD
 252.
 Wow.
 Is
 that
 a
 new
 alltime


high?
 It's
 about
 to
 go
 to
 No,
 no,
 we


covered
 252.
 It's
 about
 to
 go
 for
 253.


Let
 me
 check
 resistance


and
 see
 if
 we
 are
 getting
 253.


Uh,
 China
 also
 not
 horrible
 today.


Geopolitical
 risk.
 Yeah,
 that
 is
 usually


always
 there.
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 think


by
 end
 of
 year,
 how
 do
 we
 not
 have
 a


market
 that's
 higher
 is
 my
 question.
 253


resistance.
 13,000
 shares.
 Not
 a
 lot.


13,000
 shares.


There
 might
 be
 a
 shot.


There
 might
 be
 a
 shot.
 Trump
 tweeting.


Well,
 that's
 always
 the
 potential
 bear


case
 as
 well.


Uh
 Flowway,
 thanks
 for
 becoming
 a


channel
 member.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Matthew


says,
 "Hit
 my
 SO
 XL
 price
 target.
 I
 said


in
 April
 8
 to
 44.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 help
 of


it."
 Wow.
 8
 to
 44.
 Congrats,
 dude.
 This


is
 leveraged
 triple
 leverage


semiconductors.


8
 to
 44.
 Incredible.


Absolutely
 incredible.


Not
 bad.
 Not
 bad
 at
 all.


Doug
 says,
 "I'll
 be
 looking
 for
 a


re-entry
 into
 quantum
 as
 well.
 It's
 too


necessary
 and
 transformative."
 I
 mean,


look,
 that
 that's
 also
 a
 fair
 point.
 If


there
 are
 opportunities
 to
 re
 get
 into


some
 of
 the
 quantum
 names
 that
 have
 lost


their
 all-time
 highs,
 you
 know,
 maybe


those
 opportunities
 become
 a
 lot
 more


attractive.


The
 quantum
 names
 also,
 you
 know,
 on


earnings,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 they
 they
 also


look,
 maybe
 on
 earnings,
 the


expectations
 are
 low
 and
 they
 come
 out


with
 some
 really
 good
 numbers
 along
 with


all
 the
 general
 sentiment
 that
 Elon
 and


Sundar
 are
 talking
 about
 quantum
 and


that
 helps
 it
 out.


It's
 just
 a
 question
 of
 where
 this


industry
 like
 is
 going
 and
 then
 again
 I


don't
 think
 we
 can
 undermine
 if
 the
 US


actually
 backs
 stops
 the
 quantum


companies
 like
 they're
 probably
 not


going
 that
 much
 lower.
 I
 mean
 like
 I


know
 the
 revenue
 multiples
 are
 extremely


aggressive
 but
 if
 Donnet
 T
 is
 on
 your


side
 just
 like
 with
 Intel


you
 know
 you're
 going
 to
 have


institutional
 support.


question
 is
 what
 is
 the
 best
 entry
 price


and
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 because
 these


names
 still
 are
 up
 3
 4,000%.


He
 might
 just
 have
 to
 wait
 to
 get
 a
 a


good
 opportunity.
 Archer
 right
 there


that's
 up
 3%.
 Verizon's
 up
 1%.
 Dell's
 up


three
 and
 then
 Lily


that
 is
 also
 1%
 up.


Um


Tabitha
 says
 thank
 you
 for
 these
 morning


live
 streams.
 I
 watch
 it
 while
 I
 day


trade
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 the
 news.
 It's


super
 helpful.
 Tabitha,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Appreciate
 you
 being
 here.


You
 know,
 I
 love
 doing
 it
 every
 day.
 Oh,


I
 announced
 this
 yesterday
 on
 the
 market


close,
 but
 so
 so
 my
 birthday's
 on


Monday.
 For
 the
 everyone's
 been
 asking,


can
 we
 do
 a
 birthday
 stream?
 We're
 going


to
 do
 the
 market
 close
 and
 then
 towards


the
 end
 of
 the
 close,
 we're
 going
 to
 do


um
 not
 like
 a
 birthday
 stream,
 but
 like


it's
 just
 after
 we're
 done
 with
 the


market
 close,
 we'll
 do
 like
 a
 birthday


segment
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 a
 bunch
 of


pictures
 from
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 in
 high


school,
 all
 these
 like
 random
 memories


that
 I
 have
 and
 we
 can
 do
 like
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 photo
 album


session
 for
 uh
 for
 the
 birthday.
 I'm


also
 doing
 a
 giveaway.
 So,
 we're
 going


to
 be
 giving
 away
 some
 money.
 I
 like,


you
 know,
 I've
 always
 liked
 giving
 away


stuff
 on
 my
 birthday
 and
 kind
 of,
 you


know,
 was
 giving
 back
 to
 everybody.
 So,


we'll
 do
 that
 on
 Monday
 as
 well.
 And,


uh,
 yeah,
 I'll
 come.
 I
 got
 the
 idea


because
 I
 was
 on
 Facebook
 the
 other
 day


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 like
 a
 month.
 And


I
 was
 scrolling
 through
 all
 these
 old


pictures
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 dude,
 this
 is


kind
 of
 wild.
 Like
 28
 years
 old,
 you


have
 all
 these
 memories.
 I
 was
 like,


maybe
 we
 compile
 some
 pictures
 and
 I
 can


show
 everybody
 some
 stuff
 from
 the
 rest


of
 my
 life.


I
 never
 had
 braces.
 I
 never
 had
 braces.


I
 actually
 never
 had
 to
 deal
 with


braces,
 which
 was
 nice.


Tess
 says,
 "Baby
 pics."
 Yes.
 You're


like,
 "Dude,
 I
 was
 a
 cute
 baby."
 I'm
 not


gonna
 I
 was
 a
 cute
 baby.
 Like,
 I
 was


like,
 you
 know,
 you
 know
 how
 some
 babies


are
 ugly?
 I
 was
 not
 an
 ugly
 baby,
 bro.
 I


was
 I
 remember
 my
 mom
 told
 me
 the
 um
 the


the
 doctor
 didn't
 want
 me
 to
 go
 home.


Like,
 she
 was
 like, "This
 is
 the
 cutest


baby
 ever.
 You
 got
 to
 leave
 him
 in
 the


hospital."


So
 you
 guys
 are gonna
 see


that
 was
 a
 cute
 little
 baby.
 What


happened?


You
 sound
 like
 my
 sister.
 She
 makes
 that


joke
 every
 time.


>> Dude,
 you
 know
 my
 sister
 convinced
 me


that
 convinced
 that
 she
 figured
 out
 a


way
 to
 convince
 me
 that
 I
 was
 adopted.


She
 like
 there
 I
 think
 I
 was
 like
 seven


years
 old.
 I
 was
 crying.
 I
 ran
 up
 to
 my


mom
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 like
 di
 says


I'm
 adopted.
 Di
 is
 like
 the
 the
 Indian


way
 to
 to
 to
 to
 say
 big
 sister.


And
 my
 mom
 had
 to
 look
 me
 in
 the
 face.


She's
 like,
 "You're
 not
 adopted."
 I'm


like,
 "But
 she
 keeps
 saying
 I'm
 adopt."


She's
 like, "You're
 not
 freaking


adopted."
 Like,
 "Shut
 up."


It
 was
 hilarious,
 bro.


There
 you
 go.
 You
 got
 my
 uncle
 in
 the


chat.
 He
 says,
 "I
 can
 vouch
 for
 that.
 He


wasn't
 an
 ugly
 baby."


He
 was
 holding
 me
 in
 9798


when
 he
 used
 to
 come
 home
 from
 school


and
 he
 was
 uh
 I
 think
 he
 he
 was
 getting


a
 CPA
 around
 that
 time
 I
 think
 if
 I'm


not
 wrong.
 He
 was
 in
 accounting
 school.


He
 would
 come
 home


and
 he
 would
 uh
 he
 would
 play
 with
 me


when
 I
 was
 what
 10
 months
 old,
 12
 months


old.


I
 was
 a
 cute
 baby,
 bro.
 I
 was
 a
 cute


baby.


He
 didn't
 say
 you
 were
 cute
 either.


Yeah.
 You
 didn't
 say
 I
 was
 not
 ugly.
 You


didn't
 say
 I
 was
 cute.


Can't
 we
 all
 just
 get
 drunk?
 Dude,
 it's


a
 Monday.
 If
 my
 birthday
 was
 on
 a


Saturday,
 it'd
 be
 different.
 It's
 a


freaking
 Monday,
 bro.
 I
 I
 I
 got
 to
 do


the
 market
 close
 or
 market
 open
 on


Tuesday,
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 can
 get


drunk.


Who
 knows?
 Maybe
 maybe
 we'll
 get
 a


little
 drunk.
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 it
 is
 a


Monday.


Um


where's
 gold
 and
 silver?
 Are
 we
 still


moving
 gold
 and
 silver?
 Oh,
 wow.
 Look
 at


gold
 and
 s
 gold
 recovering
 everything.


Look
 at
 that.
 Gold
 is
 down
 0%
 on
 the


day.
 Wow.
 Gold
 getting
 the
 full


recovery.


Gold
 not
 stopping.
 Copex
 as
 well.
 Copper


miners.
 This
 one
 was
 down
 about
 three


bucks
 from
 these
 prices
 two
 days
 ago.


That
 one
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


recovery.
 60.70.
 So
 maybe
 the


commodities
 kind
 of
 getting
 back
 to
 what


they
 were
 doing
 before.
 So,


still
 trying
 to
 break
 through
 30.


Still
 trying
 to
 break
 through
 30.


Um,


Siege,
 goodness
 gracious,
 bro.
 I'll
 be


drunk
 enough
 for
 the
 both
 of
 us
 on


Monday.


Siege,
 never
 change,
 bro.
 Never
 change.


Next
 meet
 up,
 you
 gota
 you
 got
 to
 be
 the


exact
 same
 way.


Got
 to
 be
 the
 exact
 same
 way.


I
 loved
 it.
 I
 loved
 seeing
 you
 in
 Miami,


bro.
 I
 I
 again,
 I
 didn't
 drink
 in
 Miami,


but
 I
 was
 happy
 that
 you
 drank.
 I
 was


happy
 that
 everyone
 else
 had
 fun,
 but
 it


was
 cool
 to
 see
 everyone
 just
 like
 so


messed
 up,
 but
 still
 so
 happy
 to
 like


connect
 with
 people.
 AMD
 252,
 S&P


again
 trying
 to
 break
 678.
 Let's
 see


what
 other
 headlines
 we
 have.
 Oh,
 we
 got


a
 Tom
 Lee
 clip.
 Hold
 on.
 Let's
 pull
 up


Tom
 Lee.
 He
 did
 a
 new
 podcast.


Uh,
 this
 is
 a
 Bitcoin
 prediction


from
 Mr.
 Tom.


Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.


Wanted
 to
 understand
 the
 use
 case
 for


Bitcoin.
 And
 there's
 many,
 but
 they
 but


they're
 not
 too
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


conviction
 around
 something.
 To
 me,
 I


could
 say
 easily
 it
 should
 supply
 gold.


And
 so
 I
 think
 Bitcoin
 should
 be,
 you


know,
 over
 a
 million
 over
 time.
 And
 and


then
 I
 kind
 of
 prescribing
 to
 the
 view


that
 there's
 probably
 a
 chance
 that


maybe
 the
 four-year
 cycles
 ending
 for


Bitcoin
 because
 of
 the
 way
 institutional


adoption
 of
 that
 thesis
 is
 taking
 place


and
 so
 you
 have
 institutional
 and
 per


essentially
 permanent
 holders
 of
 Bitcoin


coming
 in.
 So
 uh
 should
 be
 good.
 I
 mean,


so
 I
 think
 Bitcoin
 should
 really
 build


upon
 this
 120
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 So,
 you
 know,
 200,000,
 maybe
 250


if
 someone
 wanted
 to
 under.


>> All right.
 So,
 he's
 still
 think
 saying


250.
 He
 is
 still
 saying
 250,
 bro.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know,
 guys.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we're
 seeing
 250,
 but
 if
 it
 does


happen,
 that
 would
 be


that
 would
 be
 fun.


would
 definitely
 help
 a
 lot
 of
 these


different
 assets.
 See,
 I
 mean,
 we've


seen
 crazy
 things
 in
 crypto,
 right?
 For


things
 to
 make
 the
 moves
 that
 they
 have


made.


It's
 just
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how


that
 plays
 out.
 Here's
 another
 clip
 of


Tom
 yesterday
 with
 Pomp
 talking
 a
 bit


more
 about
 crypto.


I
 I've
 now
 there's
 like
 seven
 or
 eight


gold
 stable
 coins


>> plus
 you
 know
 there's
 big
 stable
 coin


issuers
 and
 so
 that
 could
 be
 the
 bid
 to


gold.
 Now


>> does
 that
 mean
 gold
 is
 unlimited
 on
 the


upside?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I'm
 not


studying
 it
 so
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Um
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 bullish
 for


Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 because


>> what


>> well
 gold
 is
 moves
 first
 and
 then


Bitcoin
 catches
 up.
 Mhm.


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


network
 value
 of
 gold
 just
 went
 up
 by
 a


lot
 and
 so
 let's
 say
 gold
 settles
 at


5,000


>> that
 puts
 fair
 value
 of
 Bitcoin,
 you


know,
 like
 16
 to
 2
 million
 if
 it
 matches


gold's
 network
 value.
 So
 I
 think
 it's


actually
 helping
 Bitcoin's
 future


terminal
 price.


>> So
 you
 think
 that
 if
 gold
 settles
 at


5,000,
 Bitcoin,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 take


the
 gold
 market
 cap
 divided
 by
 the


number
 of
 Bitcoin,
 then
 you
 get
 1.6
 to


$2
 million
 per
 coin.
 Uh
 what's
 the
 time


frame
 for
 us
 to
 get
 there?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 can
 see
 that
 in
 five


years
 for
 Bitcoin.
 So
 I
 think


>> five
 years.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 Bitcoin
 Yeah.
 I


think
 Bitcoin


>> Bitcoin
 doesn't
 get
 capped
 by
 gold.
 It


actually
 gets
 pulled
 up
 by
 gold.


>> And


>> because
 it's
 growing
 the
 monetary
 base,


right?


>> And
 then
 uh
 this
 year
 gold's
 up
 60-ish%,


Bitcoin's
 up
 18
 to
 20%
 depending
 on
 uh


the
 day.
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 on
 December


31st
 of
 2025
 we'll
 actually
 look
 back


and
 could
 Bitcoin
 have
 outperformed
 gold


in
 2025
 even
 though
 it
 has
 such
 a
 big


lead
 right
 now?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 We


have
 we
 have
 10
 weeks.
 Um
 as
 you
 know


Bitcoin
 makes
 its
 move
 in
 10
 days
 a


year.
 So
 are
 Bitcoin's
 best
 days
 in
 the


fourth
 quarter?
 Probably
 because
 we
 have


catalyst
 the
 Fed's
 easing.
 We
 have
 a


shutdown
 that's
 been
 riskoff.
 We
 have


China
 US
 tensions
 that
 look
 every
 time


there's
 a
 headline
 on
 China
 like
 Bitcoin


takes
 a
 gut
 punch,
 right?
 Um
 because
 it


it
 is
 money
 flows
 and
 deleveraging
 uh
 so


that
 goes
 away.
 We
 have
 seasonality
 that


favors
 stocks
 moving
 up
 and
 stocks


moving
 helps
 Bitcoin.
 So
 to
 me
 uh
 the


chances
 of
 Bitcoin
 having
 a
 huge
 fourth


quarter
 are
 really
 high
 and
 not
 all
 of


these
 would
 be
 tailwinds
 for
 gold.
 So
 I


I
 you
 know
 I
 wouldn't
 count
 I
 still


think
 it's
 possible
 for
 Bitcoin
 to
 hit


200,000
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


I
 don't
 know,
 guys.
 What
 do
 you
 think?


Tom
 Lee
 saying
 10
 weeks.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of


time.


I
 mean,
 he's
 right.
 In
 crypto
 terms,


that
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 I
 just
 I
 can't


wrap
 my
 mind
 around
 200,000,
 dude.
 By


the
 end
 of
 year,


if
 that
 does
 happen,
 I
 mean,
 because
 the


reason
 I
 can't
 wrap
 my
 mind
 around
 it,


the
 actual
 reason
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


Bitcoin.
 It
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the


implications
 on
 Robin
 Hood.
 If
 Bitcoin


is
 at
 $200,000,


I
 mean,
 Robin
 Hood's
 pushing
 minimum
 175


to
 180.
 The
 transaction
 volumes
 alone,


it
 would
 be
 like
 a
 billion
 dollar


revenue
 quarter
 on
 crypto
 alone.


So,
 we're
 talking
 about
 1.8
 to$
 1.9


billion
 of
 revenue
 into
 like
 that


doesn't
 make
 sense
 to
 me.
 I
 can't
 see


that
 happening.


But
 if
 that
 does
 happen,
 like
 Coinbase


is
 going
 to
 $500.
 Like
 Micro
 Strategy
 is


going
 way
 past
 550,
 its
 previous


all-time
 high.
 Like
 the
 amount
 of
 pump


we
 would
 see.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 Ethereum


always
 lags
 behind
 Bitcoin,
 right?
 So
 if


Bitcoin's
 at
 200,000,
 I
 mean,
 we're


Ethereum's
 got
 to
 be
 somewhere
 near
 8
 to


9,000,
 right?


even
 if
 it's
 at
 7,000
 and
 Bitmine's
 at


freaking
 probably
 75
 80
 but
 like
 the


implications
 of
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 so


gigantic
 that
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 it


happen.


And
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 he
 he's
 not
 backing


down
 from
 it.
 He's
 not
 saying
 like,
 "Oh


yeah,
 we're
 getting
 close
 to
 the
 end
 of


the
 year."
 He's
 like, "No,
 10
 weeks
 is


plenty
 of
 time."
 He's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 we're


fine.
 We'll
 be
 good."


And
 so
 if
 it
 dude
 if
 if
 if
 it
 does


happen,


I
 mean
 that's
 a
 big
 big
 call
 by
 Tom
 Lee.


No,
 no,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 get
 everything
 you're


saying.
 Bitcoin's
 a
 worldwide
 asset.


Bitcoin's
 move
 happens
 within
 9
 to
 10


days.
 I
 get
 it.
 But
 a
 $90,000
 candle


to
 end
 out
 the
 year,
 even
 if
 it
 is


within
 a
 couple
 of
 days,
 like
 I
 that's


massive,
 bro.
 I
 would
 not
 complain
 about


that.
 It's
 just
 if
 it
 does
 happen,


it
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible.


And
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 rate
 cuts
 coming


too.
 Like
 if
 he
 if
 Tom
 Lee
 was
 saying


130,
 140,
 I'm
 like,
 okay.
 Like
 because


you
 could
 see
 that,
 but
 he's
 he's
 going


for
 the
 jugular.
 He's
 going
 for
 200.


And
 you
 know,
 he's
 he's
 no
 stranger
 to


giving
 out
 price
 targets.
 He's
 been


giving
 out
 price
 targets
 for
 35
 years
 as


an
 analyst.
 So,
 he
 knows
 what
 it
 means


to,
 you
 know,
 make
 a
 price
 target
 and


stick
 with
 your
 call
 or
 readjust
 your


rating.


And
 he's
 sticking
 with
 it.


He
 is
 sticking


with
 it.


Um,
 Stuvoski,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $50


super
 chat.
 Been
 following
 you
 since
 22.


In
 my
 opinion,
 you've
 become
 one
 of
 the


top
 creators
 in
 the
 space.
 You
 create
 so


much
 value
 for
 us
 here
 every
 day.
 Thanks


for
 your
 dedication,
 showing
 up
 every


day.
 Much
 respect,
 mate.
 We
 appreciate


you.
 Love
 from
 Aussie
 Sheroski.
 Thank


you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.


Appreciate
 it.
 Hopefully
 we
 can
 have
 a


great
 end
 to
 the
 year
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 And


um
 yeah,
 it's
 been
 awesome,
 dude.
 It's


been
 an
 awesome
 awesome
 community
 over


the
 past
 three
 years.
 And
 I
 think
 the


meetups
 next
 year,
 we
 can
 take
 it
 to
 the


next
 level
 and,
 you
 know,
 really
 do
 this


in
 a
 in
 a
 fun
 way.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 want


to
 make
 it
 fun.
 I
 want
 I
 want
 to
 make
 it


really
 fun.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 the
 mods
 to


show
 up
 to
 the
 meetups
 as
 well.
 I
 think


there
 might
 be
 a
 world
 where
 every
 new


city
 we
 go
 to,
 a
 couple
 mods
 can
 can
 be


there
 because
 it
 was
 it
 was
 really
 nice


to
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 mods
 in
 Miami
 just


because
 a
 it
 it
 helped
 me
 a
 bit
 and
 also


b
 like
 you
 know
 they
 were
 able
 to


incorporate
 and
 make
 people
 feel
 welcome


and
 it
 was
 just
 it
 really
 felt
 like
 the


chat
 was
 in
 person
 in
 Miami.
 And
 so
 if


we
 could
 replicate
 that
 in
 every
 city
 we


go
 to
 that'll
 be
 really
 fun.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 what
 we
 can
 do.


We're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 what
 we
 can
 do.


S&P
 676.


That
 is
 also
 green.
 Were
 they
 modding


conversation
 in
 person,
 too?
 Yes,
 they


were
 banning
 people.
 If
 you
 were
 bearish


hood,
 they
 would
 ban
 you
 immediately
 in


person.
 You
 like,
 "You
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of


here,
 bro.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of
 here."


If
 we
 do
 UK,
 you
 know,
 Tess
 is
 going
 to


be
 there.
 You
 know
 Tess
 is
 going
 to
 be


there.


Tessa
 is
 going
 to
 be
 there
 and
 she
 will


be
 hosting
 a
 quantum
 seminar
 at
 the


meetup.
 That's
 what's
 going
 to
 be


happening.
 There
 will
 be
 a
 meetup
 and


then
 there
 will
 be
 a
 quantum
 seminar
 in


the
 meetup.


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 so
 serious
 too.
 This
 is
 what


happens.
 Like
 there
 like
 if
 you're
 and


and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 a
 mod
 to
 do


this,
 but
 if
 you're
 like
 an
 expert
 in
 a


certain
 thing,
 like
 you
 end
 up
 talking


about
 it
 at
 the
 meetups
 and
 I've


literally
 seen
 10
 15
 people
 in
 a
 circle


with
 what
 I
 mean
 Adam
 Adam
 was
 like


there
 were
 30
 people
 with
 him
 and
 he
 was


talking
 about
 how
 to
 sell
 puts
 for
 like


a
 good
 50
 minutes.
 He
 was
 sitting
 with


30
 people
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 about


selling
 puts,
 answering
 questions,
 all


that
 stuff.


So
 if
 we
 if
 we
 go
 to
 the
 UK,
 I'm
 sure


Tess
 will
 be
 there
 and
 she
 will
 get
 you


drunk
 as
 well.
 That's
 the
 other
 thing.


She
 she'll
 be
 she'll
 be
 she'll
 be


talking
 about
 Quantum
 for
 five
 hours


while
 she'll
 she'll
 be
 drinking
 and
 tw


talking
 about
 Quantum
 at
 the
 same
 time


and
 it'll
 almost
 be
 like
 she's
 not
 even


drunk
 when
 she
 talks
 about
 it.
 But
 she


will
 make
 sure
 you
 get
 drunk


cuz
 her
 tolerance
 is
 something.
 I
 mean


like
 I
 know
 the
 Brits
 can
 drink,
 but
 she


is
 a
 different
 type
 of
 Brit
 that
 can


drink.


She's
 a
 different
 type
 of
 Brit
 that
 can


drink.
 I
 need
 an
 excuse
 to
 go
 to
 the
 UK


again.
 Yeah.
 hopefully
 becomes
 an
 excuse


for
 everyone
 who
 wants
 to
 go
 on
 vacation


to
 uh
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 an
 excuse
 for
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 to
 come
 to
 Miami


and
 that's
 why
 it
 was
 fun.


Um


Beepster,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 100
 super


chat.
 Hi,
 thank
 you
 for
 all
 you
 do
 for


the
 community.
 Ever
 since
 I
 moved
 to


Southeast
 Asia,
 it's
 been
 hard
 to
 keep


up
 with
 the
 market
 closes.
 Have
 an
 early


birthday
 present
 on
 me.
 Hope
 to


celebrate
 many
 more
 with
 you
 and
 this


great
 community
 you
 have
 fostered.


Beepster,
 thank
 you
 man.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 and
 uh
 congrats
 on
 the
 move


to
 Southeast
 Asia.
 I
 know
 the
 timing
 is


definitely
 a
 bit
 different
 to
 catch


these
 market
 opens
 and
 the
 closes,
 but


thank
 you
 for
 the
 happy
 birthday
 wish


and
 appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 every
 day.


AMD
 right
 there,
 251
 still
 holding
 at


Google
 259.
 We're
 not
 getting
 any
 crazy


headlines.
 Oh,
 do
 we
 have a
 China


headline?
 No,
 no
 China
 headline.
 I


thought
 we
 almost
 No,
 we
 do.
 We
 do.
 We


do.
 Uh,
 China
 embassy
 says


China
 embassy
 says


this
 is
 hilarious,
 bro.
 The
 China


embassy
 just
 came
 out
 and
 says
 the


United
 States
 is
 the
 world's
 number
 one


hacking
 state.


The
 United
 States
 is
 the
 world's
 number


one
 hacking
 state.


Why?
 Like
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 hilarious


because
 the
 amount
 of
 hacking
 the


Chinese
 have
 done
 is
 like
 if
 you
 go
 down


the
 rabbit
 hole
 and
 then
 the
 North


Koreans
 go
 down,
 type
 in
 North
 Korea


Sony
 hacking
 on
 Google,
 you
 are
 going
 to


go
 down
 a
 rabbit
 hole
 to
 see
 what
 the


North
 Koreans
 did.
 But
 the
 Chinese


embassy
 says
 the
 NSA
 case
 is


self-evident
 that
 a
 real
 Volt
 typhoon


operation
 looks
 like
 the
 US
 and


therefore
 the
 US
 is
 the
 number
 one


hacking
 state.


That's
 weird.
 What
 I
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what


motivated
 them
 to
 say
 that
 today.


But
 there
 you
 go.


Yeah.
 They're
 basically
 the
 US
 has
 hyped


up
 the
 so-called
 China
 cyber
 threat


theory,
 coerced
 other
 countries
 to
 syrup


up
 Chinese
 hacker
 attack
 incidents,


sanctioned
 Chinese
 enterprises,
 and


prosecuted
 Chinese
 citizens
 to
 confuse


the
 public
 and
 distort
 the
 truth.


Gotta
 love
 the
 CCP,
 bro.
 Gotta
 love
 the


CCP.
 All right.
 Well,
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 enough
 to
 give
 us
 a
 red
 candle.
 I


mean,
 markets
 are
 still
 kind
 of
 holding


up
 so
 right
 there.
 2912
 S&P

Um,


we
 are
 the
 number
 one
 state
 to
 get


hacked.
 Yeah,
 we've
 been
 hacked
 a
 lot


more
 than
 before.


Trump
 is
 going
 to
 be
 pissed.
 What?
 Watch


Trump
 respond.


And
 he's
 like,
 actually,


the
 Chinese


cannot
 hack
 any
 of
 our
 infrastructure.


Has
 he
 tweet
 tweeted
 yet,
 Trump?
 No.
 The


last
 tweet
 he
 had
 was,
 "The
 stock
 market


is
 stronger
 than
 ever
 before
 because
 of


tariffs.


Um,


yeah.
 You're
 not
 seeing
 any
 other
 crazy


headlines.


It's
 11:00
 a.m.
 already.
 Dude,
 this
 it


feels
 like
 it's
 barely
 10
 a.m.


Bank

Okay,
 so
 the
 Bank

 looking


into
 a
 inquisition
 of
 how
 much
 data


center

 is
 going
 on.
 It
 makes


sense.
 They're
 a

 They
 want
 to
 make


sure
 their

are
 going
 to
 be
 okay
 on
 these

No
 Trump
 tweet.


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 getting


anything
 too
 crazy.
 As
 long
 as
 we
 don't


have
 anything
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 I
 think
 maybe
 we


maybe
 we
 get
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 this.

Well,
 it
 was
 up
 25,
 now
 it's
 up
 20%.


There
 is
 an
 arbitrage
 there.
 If
 you


think
 they
 go
 private
 at
 18
 and
 you
 buy


at
 15:30,
 you
 can
 make
 some
 money,
 but


they
 actually
 do
 have
 to
 go
 through
 with


the
 deal
 for
 that
 to
 play
 out.


Um,


Mexican
 president
 says,
 "We're
 going
 to


wait
 when
 asked
 about
 decision
 to


terminate
 trade
 talks
 with
 uh
 with


Canada.


Well,
 look,
 the
 Mexican
 president
 has


had
 a
 really
 good
 uh
 really
 good
 track


record
 with
 Trump
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months
 in
 terms
 of
 negotiations.


I
 guess,
 you
 know,
 he's
 more
 upset
 at


Canada
 today,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see
 if
 that
 ends
 up
 resulting
 in
 any


pain
 with
 Mexico.
 Uh
 Beyond
 Meat


continuing
 to
 get
 to
 lows
 of
 weak
 now
 as


that
 one
 is
 down
 another


7%
 on
 the
 day.


See,
 you
 know,
 there
 were
 so
 Beyond
 Meat


was
 also
 a
 momentum
 stock,
 but
 unlike


the
 quantum
 names
 and
 Oaklo
 and
 Nuclear,


a
 lot
 of
 those
 kind
 of
 found
 their


bottom,
 right?
 And
 that's
 why
 they've


recovered.
 Like
 D-Wave
 is
 still
 down
 for


the
 week,
 but
 it's
 up
 6%.
 So,
 you
 know,


maybe
 it
 found
 it
 bottom
 its
 bottom
 at


26.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 freaking
 Beyond
 Meat


is
 finding
 any
 type
 of
 a
 bottom.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 just
 750
 to
 260.
 like
 who
 comes


in
 and
 buys
 it
 at
 260
 and
 reverses
 it


back.


Especially
 now
 that
 the
 shorts
 are


winning,
 right?
 The
 shorts
 were
 losing


on
 the
 squeeze
 and
 now
 they're
 winning.

 are
 some

completely

right,
 let's
 see
 some
 of
 the

 stuff


we
 have.


Um,
 shutdown

Well,
 we,
 you
 know,
 we
 listened
 to


Trump,
 we
 listened
 to
 Mike
 Johnson.


Let's
 listen
 to
 the
 other
 side.


I
 mean,
 let's
 see
 what
 the
 Democrats
 are


saying
 here.
 And
 if
 there's
 any


perspective
 on
 what
 could
 change.
 Here


is
 Hakee
 Jeff.


And


here
 is
 his
 take
 on
 this
 shutdown


>> and
 enacted
 the
 largest
 cut
 to
 Medicaid


in
 American
 history,
 but
 refused
 to


consider
 extending
 Affordable
 Care
 Act


tax
 credits
 that
 actually
 benefit


workingclass
 Americans,
 everyday


Americans,
 and
 middle
 class
 Americans.


their
 priorities
 are
 misplaced.
 And
 as


Democrats,
 we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to


fight
 uh
 for
 the
 American
 people
 all


across
 the
 country
 in
 rural
 America,


urban
 America,
 small
 town
 America,
 the


heartland
 America
 of
 America,
 and
 of


course,
 black
 and
 brown
 communities


throughout
 America,
 all
 of
 whom
 are


being
 devastated
 by
 this
 Republican


healthcare
 crisis.


>> Leader
 Jeff,
 we
 were
 just
 joined
 by


Senator
 James
 Langford
 from
 Oklahoma.


He's
 a
 Republican
 and
 his
 his
 concern


with
 this
 was
 that
 the
 ACA
 subsidies


aren't
 helping
 bring
 cost
 down
 overall.


He
 said
 that
 in
 his
 state,
 Oklahoma,
 if


you
 look
 over
 six
 years
 from
 2013
 to


2019,
 premiums
 for
 ACA
 plans
 were
 up
 by


200%
 versus
 premiums
 being
 up
 by
 29%
 for


commercial
 plans
 in
 his
 state.
 His


concern
 is
 that
 there's
 something
 that


needs
 to
 be
 fixed
 within
 this.
 Um,
 some


of
 the
 things
 he
 threw
 out
 would
 be


things
 like
 limiting
 fraud
 by
 just


requiring
 that
 there
 be
 at
 least
 a
 $20


premium
 or
 some
 premium
 that's
 put
 down


instead
 of
 zero
 premium
 so
 that
 people


get
 enrolled
 in
 things
 without
 even


knowing
 that
 they're
 enrolled
 in
 some
 of


these
 programs.
 What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 that?


We've
 made
 clear
 uh
 in
 the
 House
 that
 we


will
 consider
 anything
 that
 emerges
 from


the
 Senate
 in
 good
 faith
 in
 a
 bipartisan


way
 uh
 that
 both
 reopens
 the
 government


while
 at
 the
 same
 time
 addresses
 this


healthc
 care
 crisis
 and
 extends
 the


Affordable
 Care
 Act
 tax
 credits
 in
 a


meaningful
 way.
 The
 uh
 90%
 or
 so
 of
 the


people
 who
 benefit
 from
 these
 Affordable


Care
 Act
 tax
 credits
 make
 $63,000
 per


year
 or
 less.
 And
 a
 significant
 number


of
 small
 businesses
 and
 entrepreneurs


across
 the
 country
 rely
 upon
 the


Affordable
 Care
 Act
 tax
 credits
 in
 order


to
 provide
 health
 insurance
 for


themselves
 and
 for
 their
 families.
 So


this
 is
 an
 issue
 that
 needs
 to
 be


addressed.
 In
 fact,
 we
 know
 uh
 that
 red


state
 residents
 actually
 are


disproportionately
 higher
 represented
 in


terms
 of
 the
 Affordable
 Care
 Act
 tax


credits
 than
 any
 other
 part
 of
 the


country.
 And
 so
 we're
 fighting
 for


>> same
 argument
 that
 Bernie
 made


yesterday.
 Again,
 their
 their
 argument


here
 is
 that
 the
 Republicans
 are
 more
 in


jeopardy
 of
 losing
 health
 care
 than
 uh


than


than
 the
 Democrats
 because
 the
 ACA


subsidies
 extend
 to
 a
 lot
 more


Republicans.
 So,
 you
 know,
 their
 their


argument
 here
 is
 that
 if
 we
 don't
 do


this,
 Republicans
 will
 get
 hurt
 more.


Obviously,
 Mike
 Johnson
 and
 the
 other


people
 disagree.


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we


get
 any
 level
 of
 meaningful
 negotiation


on
 this.
 This
 has
 been
 bad.
 This
 is
 now


23
 days,
 guys.
 23
 days
 we've
 been
 stuck


on
 this
 shutdown.
 It
 almost
 feels
 like


there
 is
 no
 shutdown
 because
 how
 the


market
 has
 not
 cared,
 but
 there
 is.
 And


eventually,
 you
 would
 imagine
 there
 are


some
 impacts
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 see.


But
 I
 do
 wonder
 if
 this
 ends
 up
 getting


resolved
 anytime
 soon.
 S&P
 still
 holding


strong.
 6767,


AMD
 252.
 Yeah,
 23
 days,
 right?
 It
 went


fast.
 It's
 almost
 like
 the
 shutdown
 was


announced
 yesterday,
 but
 it's
 been
 23


days.


You
 do
 have
 some
 red
 candles.
 Google


losing
 260.
 AMD
 losing
 252.


SoFi
 tried
 to
 break
 2950.
 Got
 up
 there
 a


little
 bit
 now
 back
 below.
 Hoodie
 142
 to


137.
 I
 mean,


you
 do
 have
 some
 red,
 but
 nothing


as
 crazy.


Yeah,
 it
 was
 35
 days
 in
 2018.


So,


we
 do
 have
 a
 ways
 to
 go
 to
 get
 there.


Um,


oh
 boy.
 Kramer
 just
 tweeted,
 "Pounder


next
 stop
 200."
 Goodness
 gracious,
 bro.


If
 Pounder
 gets
 a
 red
 candle.


There
 you
 go.
 Of
 course,


Mr.
 Why
 can't
 he
 just
 let
 us
 live,
 bro?


Why
 does
 he
 always
 have
 to


every
 time?


Um,
 speaking
 of
 the
 Chinese
 hacking,


this
 is
 a
 fun
 clip


of
 him
 talking
 about
 China
 hacks.


>> Hack,
 didn't
 they
 hack
 into
 our
 telecom


system?
 They've
 been
 stealing


intellectual
 property.
 They
 fentinel,
 co


I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 this
 stuff.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 negotiate
 with
 obviously
 a


bad
 actor
 on
 economics?


>> You
 don't
 think
 we
 do
 that
 to
 them?


>> We
 do.


>> So,
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things.


>> That's
 the
 way
 the
 world
 works.


>> That's
 the
 way
 the
 world
 works.
 It's
 a


nasty
 world.
 And
 then
 you
 just
 do
 a


trade
 deal.


>> We
 do.
 Well,
 we
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 with


this
 trade
 deal.
 You
 know,
 I
 do
 a
 trade


deal
 if
 it
 works.
 We
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money


with
 the
 trade
 deal.


>> Hack,
 didn't
 they
 hack
 into
 our
 tele?


>> All
 right.
 So,
 Trump
 basically
 saying,


"Look,
 we
 have
 to
 fight
 them.
 They
 have


to
 fight
 us,
 and
 there's
 not
 much
 we
 can


do."
 Here
 are
 the
 clips
 from
 Hasset
 and


what
 he's
 he
 was
 saying
 this
 morning


around
 shutdown
 and
 a
 couple
 other


things,


>> right?
 Well,
 well,
 the
 measure
 of
 the


effect
 is
 first
 of
 all
 the
 750,000


workers
 that
 aren't
 getting
 their


paychecks
 uh
 that
 it
 it's
 really


disruptive
 for
 their
 lives
 and
 that


disruption
 is
 happening
 because
 of
 the


Schumer
 shutdown.
 We
 want
 the
 Democrats


to
 open
 the
 Senate
 and
 then
 we're
 happy


to
 talk
 with
 them
 about
 any
 policy
 they


want
 to
 talk
 about,
 but
 the
 actual
 GDP


effects
 are
 starting
 to
 be
 seen
 in
 just


but
 we
 just
 have
 high
 frequency
 data


that's
 not
 government
 data.
 We
 expect


that
 it's
 going
 to
 reduce
 GDP
 by
 about
 a


tenth
 of
 a
 percent
 for
 every
 week
 uh


that
 it's
 shut
 down.


>> Okay.
 Well,


>> that
 is
 pretty
 wild.
 A
 tenth
 of
 a


percent
 for
 every
 week
 that
 government


is
 shut
 down.
 And
 then
 this
 is
 more


about
 talking
 about
 the
 deficit.


>> The
 bottom
 line
 is
 the
 markets
 are


responding
 not
 because
 they
 think


inflation's
 going
 up,
 but
 because
 they


believe
 as
 we
 know
 is
 true
 that


inflation
 is
 headed
 in
 the
 right


trajectory.
 And
 and
 here's
 what
 I
 was
 uh


would
 like
 to
 say
 about
 that.
 That
 if


you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 the
 history
 of


the
 Biden
 administration,
 then
 what


people
 are
 going
 to
 say
 is
 that
 Biden's


runaway
 deficits
 caused
 the
 biggest


inflation
 spike
 basically
 we
 had
 since


the
 70s.
 There's
 no
 dispute
 about
 that


really.
 Well,
 why
 is
 inflation
 going


down
 now?
 Well,
 it's
 because
 President


Trump's
 policies
 are
 set,
 we
 just
 did


the
 calculation
 to
 reduce
 the
 deficit
 by


$600
 billion
 this
 year
 alone.
 And
 that's


because
 uh
 we've
 got
 laugher
 curve


effects.
 So
 tax
 revenue
 is
 up
 about
 200


billion.
 We've
 cut
 discretionary


spending
 already
 this
 year
 by
 about
 200


billion.
 And
 we've
 got
 the
 tariff


revenue.
 And
 so
 we're
 doing
 the
 exact


opposite
 of
 what
 Biden
 did
 to
 feed


inflation.
 And
 so
 of
 course
 inflation's


going
 down.
 That's
 the
 only
 way
 it
 could


go.
 The
 bottom
 line
 is
 the
 markets
 are


>> all
 right.
 Hasset
 seems
 pretty
 bullish


on
 inflation
 coming
 down
 and
 the
 deficit


coming
 down
 as
 well.
 Um,


I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 the
 government


continues
 to
 be
 shut
 down
 and
 we're


losing
 a
 tenth
 of
 GDP
 every
 week,
 a
 lot


of
 that
 GDP
 being
 contributed
 by
 the


government,
 that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 good


for
 our
 numbers.
 But
 the
 question
 is,


does
 this
 end
 up
 lasting
 as
 long
 as
 it


did
 back
 in


back
 in
 2018?
 Is
 Clover
 squeezing
 COLV?


Oh,
 yeah.
 Maybe
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


squeeze
 right
 here.
 Clover
 was
 one
 of


the
 OG
 stocks
 in
 2021


that
 ended
 up
 squeezing
 hardcore.


Uh,
 this
 was
 one
 of
 Chamat's
 first


spaxs.


It's
 not
 a
 massive
 short
 float,
 only


13%.


But
 maybe
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


squeeze


on
 the
 day.


Um,


I
 think
 that's
 it,
 guys.
 I
 don't
 think


we
 have
 that
 much
 else
 going
 on.
 We


don't
 have
 CPI
 was
 the
 big
 news
 of
 the


day.
 We
 got
 that
 headline,
 pumped
 up
 the


markets,
 S&P
 all-time
 highs


unless
 the
 Canada
 tweet
 no
 one
 cared


about.


And
 then
 CPI
 was
 kind
 of the
 main
 story.


The
 Oracle
 news
 from
 yesterday,
 massive


for
 the
 data
 centers.
 I
 think
 that's
 why


Cipher,
 Iran,
 all
 those
 are
 getting
 some


love.
 But
 realistically,
 CPI
 set
 up
 a


pretty
 good
 week
 going
 into
 an
 a
 rate


cut.
 And
 then
 next
 week's
 a
 big
 week
 for


earnings.
 I
 mean,
 next
 week
 is


your
 big
 week.


Next
 week
 you
 have
 SoFi,
 PayPal,
 UPS,


Etsy,
 Shell.


Is
 this
 correct?
 Are
 Microsoft
 Meta
 and


Google
 all
 on
 the
 same
 day?


Hold
 on.
 Is
 that
 correct?
 Microsoft


earnings.


Uh,
 are
 they
 all
 on
 Wednesday,
 bro?
 That


would
 be
 crazy.
 The
 calendar
 I'm
 looking


at.
 Yes,
 bro.
 Hold
 on.
 That
 day
 is
 going


to
 be
 insanity.


We
 have
 to
 cover
 Microsoft
 Meta
 and


Google
 on
 the
 same
 day.


And
 you
 have
 Starbucks
 and
 you
 have


Chipotle
 and
 you
 have
 Service
 Now
 and


you
 have
 Coca-Cola
 and
 you
 have
 Carvana


and
 you
 have
 Micardo
 Libre
 and
 then


Amazon
 and
 Apple
 are
 on
 there.
 Usually


there's
 a
 break


between
 Microsoft
 Meta
 and
 Google.


Dude,
 that
 day
 is
 going
 to
 be
 insane.


All right,
 folks.
 Whatever
 you're
 doing,


clear
 out
 Wednesday
 the
 29th.


Clear
 out
 Wednesday
 the
 29th.
 That
 is


going
 to
 be
 madness.


That's
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 well,
 dude.


Yeah,
 it's
 no
 break
 for
 me.
 Not
 that


day.


Not
 that
 day.
 Amazon
 and
 Micro
 Strategy


the
 day
 after
 with
 Apple


and
 then
 the
 Fed
 decision
 the
 day


before.
 Wait,
 no,
 the
 Fed
 decision
 is
 in


the
 morning,
 right?
 Oh,
 yeah.
 the
 Fed


decisions.
 Dude,
 so
 the
 Fed
 cuts
 in
 the


morning
 and
 then
 Microsoft
 met
 a
 Google


report
 in
 the
 afternoon.


Dude,
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 wild.


The
 29th
 is
 your
 birthday.
 Well,
 a


couple
 of
 you
 guys
 have
 a
 birthday
 on


the
 29th.


All
 right,
 dude.
 Imagine
 the
 S&P
 just


rips.
 Imagine.
 Okay,
 I'm
 just
 like


imagine
 we
 get
 like
 a
 7,000
 push
 on
 that


day.
 Like
 imagine
 the
 earnings
 are
 so


good
 and
 the
 rates
 are
 down.
 Like
 it


would
 be
 wild.


I
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 happen,
 but
 it


could
 be
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 crazy
 day.


Uh
 shout
 out
 to
 Chris.
 He
 just
 tagged
 me


in
 this
 chill
 Friday
 morning
 watching
 a


mid
 cover
 the
 markets
 with
 my
 V1
 Rocket


Lab
 mug
 that
 apparently
 got
 an
 upgrade


in
 the
 new
 shop
 refresh.
 Dude,
 that's


awesome.
 Look
 at
 that.
 That
 is
 so
 cool.


Doug
 says,
 "I'm
 taking
 that
 day
 off
 of


work.
 Not
 like
 I
 do
 anything
 at
 work


anyway.
 Yeah,
 no
 one
 will
 be
 able
 to


focus
 at
 work
 on
 a
 day
 like
 that.
 It
 is


so
 cool
 to
 see
 you
 guys
 tag
 how
 you


watch
 the
 show.
 Like
 uh
 I
 love
 seeing


that
 just
 because
 it's
 it's
 really
 cool


from
 my
 perspective
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 mean,


someone
 was
 literally
 drinking
 milk.


Shout
 out
 to
 Bob
 while
 watching
 me
 and


Steve
 yesterday.


I
 don't
 get
 how
 how
 you
 guys
 like
 milk.


I
 guess
 Steve
 has
 brainwashed
 everyone


into
 drinking
 ice
 cold
 milk,
 but
 there


you
 go.


So,


super
 cool.
 Super
 cool
 stuff.
 I
 think


that
 is
 it
 for
 today
 for
 today.
 Yeah,


maybe
 it's
 an
 old
 day
 stream
 that
 day.


We
 haven't
 done
 an
 old
 day
 stream
 in
 a


while.
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 year
 since
 we


did
 a
 full-on
 old
 day
 stream.
 Actually,


that's
 not
 true.
 May
 May
 2025
 we
 did
 do


I
 remember
 we
 did
 one
 in
 in
 May
 because


I
 remember
 by
 the
 end
 of
 it
 I
 was
 dead.


We
 ended
 at
 like
 9:30
 p.m.
 But
 maybe
 we


do
 that
 on
 Wednesday.


All
 right.
 So,
 there
 we
 go.
 I
 think


that's
 it
 for
 today.
 Chris,
 thank
 you


for
 that.
 Um,


again,
 S&P
 making
 even
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


push
 right
 here
 to
 678.
 But
 overall,


been
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 awesome
 day.
 And
 if


we
 can
 just
 continue
 this
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 then
 it
 would
 be
 very


very
 fun.


Would
 be
 very,
 very
 fun.
 Ignasio
 says,


"First
 time
 hit
 20K."
 Congratulations.


Incredible.
 Uh
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 days


that's
 creating
 probably
 a
 lot
 of
 moves


for
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 in
 the
 port.
 We'll


do
 year-to-
 dates
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week


or
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 market
 close,
 but
 I


think
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 are
 up
 from


where
 we
 were
 last
 week


when
 we
 were
 barely
 holding
 665.


Now
 we're
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 up
 to
 678.


There
 you
 go.


Um,
 okay.
 Let's
 do
 word
 of
 the
 day
 and


then
 we're
 done.
 We'll
 go
 to
 chat
 GBT


and
 we
 will
 get
 our
 word
 of
 the
 days.


What
 do
 we
 got,


bro?
 How
 like


don't
 tell
 me
 anyone
 can
 easily
 say


that.
 Don't
 tell
 me
 anyone
 can
 easily


say
 that.
 Susurus.


Susurus.
 A
 soft
 whispering
 or
 rustling


sound.


Susurus.


>> Cissurus.


>> Of
 course,
 Cissurus.
 Why
 not?
 A
 soft


whispering
 or
 rustling
 sound
 like
 leaves


swaying
 in
 the
 wind
 or
 distant
 murmurss


of
 a
 crowd.


The
 cissurus
 of
 the
 ocean
 at
 night
 made


it
 impossible
 to
 tell
 where
 the
 waves


ended
 and
 dreams
 began.


Yeah,
 it
 seems
 sus
 to
 me,
 bro.
 I've


never
 heard
 this
 word
 before.
 A
 soft


whispering
 or
 rustling
 sound.


Admit
 that's
 legit
 the
 second
 word
 you


learn
 in
 school
 after
 cat.
 Yeah,


apparently.


Apparently.
 I've
 never
 heard
 this
 word


before,
 but
 there
 you
 go.


There
 you
 go.
 That
 is
 our
 word
 of
 the


day.


And
 we
 are
 done
 for
 this
 Friday
 morning.


We
 are
 officially
 done


for
 this
 Friday
 morning.


Thank
 you,
 Mitt.
 How
 do
 you
 feel
 about


almost
 10,000
 people
 watching
 every


single
 day?
 Look,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 mean,


thank
 you
 to
 everyone
 who's
 been
 showing


up.
 It
 has
 I
 think
 it's
 we've
 been


getting
 to
 that
 10,000
 I
 think
 for
 the


past
 past
 couple
 weeks
 now.
 It's
 really


cool,
 dude.
 It's
 really
 cool.
 I
 was


talking
 about
 this
 yesterday
 in
 the


market
 close,
 just
 reflecting
 on
 it.
 Uh


it's
 just
 been
 an
 incredible
 journey.


It's
 been
 awesome.
 It's


I
 I I
 I
 think
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this


with
 Tanner
 as
 well
 the
 other
 day.
 Um


because
 you
 know
 Tanner
 doesn't
 know
 do


a
 market
 open
 market
 close
 but
 he's
 been


growing
 his
 live
 streams
 as
 well
 every


day.
 And
 you
 know
 there's
 not
 that
 many


people
 in
 the
 financial
 space
 that
 go


live
 every
 day


multiple
 times
 a
 day.
 There's
 really
 a


handful
 of
 people.
 So
 it
 is
 a
 little bit


of
 an
 isolated
 space.
 Um


but
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think


that
 the
 number
 necessar
 And
 really


honestly
 the
 numbers
 never
 had
 an
 impact


in
 terms
 of
 live
 viewers.
 Like
 it's


something
 you
 pay
 attention
 to,
 but
 it's


not
 something
 you
 obsess
 over
 or
 it's


not
 something
 that
 necessarily
 changes


like
 who
 you
 are,
 you
 know?
 Like
 for
 the


people
 that
 were
 here
 when
 there
 were
 40


people
 in
 2022,
 it
 really
 is
 the
 same


energy
 and
 that
 that's
 the
 reason
 I


think
 people
 continue
 to
 come
 back


because
 that
 energy
 is
 something
 that


they're
 attracted
 to
 every
 day.


But
 I
 mean,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 more


people
 that
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 opinions
 and


you
 have
 to
 deal
 with,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 say
 something
 in
 a
 in
 a
 lot
 more


ways
 because
 there's
 just
 so
 much
 more


of
 a
 magnitude
 of
 feedback
 that's
 going


to
 come
 your
 way
 and
 that
 you
 just
 got


to,
 you
 know,
 learn
 how
 to
 deal
 with
 it


over
 the
 long
 term.
 But
 I
 am
 deeply


appreciative.
 It
 means
 a
 lot.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 we
 built
 a
 real
 real


community
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the


I
 think
 the
 numbers
 are
 more
 validation


that
 the
 people
 that
 show
 up
 live
 every


day
 care
 about
 that
 community.
 they
 want


to
 be
 part
 of
 that
 community.
 Um,
 not


everyone
 has
 to
 agree
 in
 that
 community,


whether
 it's
 a
 political
 belief
 or
 a


belief
 on
 a
 stock,
 but
 as
 long
 as


everyone
 respects
 each
 other
 in
 the


community,
 that's
 the
 most
 important


thing.
 And
 it's
 fun,
 dude.
 You
 get
 to


wake
 up
 every
 morning
 and,
 you
 know,
 all


of
 us
 get
 to
 be
 together
 every
 single


day.
 Like,
 that's
 like
 it's
 it's
 just


it's
 something
 I
 don't
 take
 for
 granted


at
 all
 as
 the
 S&P
 is
 trying
 to
 break


alltime
 highs
 again.
 It's
 something
 I
 do


not
 take
 for
 granted.
 And
 I
 just
 want
 to


find
 more
 ways
 to
 give
 back.
 like


literally
 with
 like,
 you
 know,
 actually


giving
 back
 money
 and
 prizes
 and
 stuff.


Just
 like
 ways
 to
 like
 constantly
 just


just
 show
 how
 thankful
 I
 am
 for
 this,


but
 also
 with
 the
 meetups
 because
 I


think
 that's
 the
 the
 most
 fun
 stuff.
 So,


we'll
 we
 will
 be
 doing
 giveaway
 on
 my


birthday.
 I
 asked
 if
 I
 should
 like
 give


away
 something
 physical,
 but
 people
 said


cash
 instead.
 So,
 we'll
 just
 do
 cash
 and


uh
 maybe
 we'll
 try
 to
 do
 we
 we'll
 do


something
 going
 into
 Christmas.
 We'll
 do


like
 I
 don't know
 like
 giving
 away
 a


MacBook
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 We'll


we'll
 do
 something
 like
 that
 going
 going


to
 Christmas,
 but
 we'll
 do
 cash
 for
 for


the
 birthday
 and
 then
 yeah,
 the
 meetups


hopefully
 can
 continue
 to
 just


consolidate
 this
 entire
 community
 as


well.


By
 cash,
 I
 mean
 Venmo
 or
 PayPal


basically.
 But
 yes,
 we'll
 do
 cash.


Um


like
 with
 your
 family.
 I
 don't
 agree


with
 my
 sisters.
 I'm
 right,
 they
 are


wrong.
 Yeah,
 pretty
 much.


pretty
 much.


My
 sister
 did
 ask
 me
 the
 same
 question


the
 other
 day
 though.
 She
 was
 like
 like


because
 my
 sister
 is
 much
 more
 sensitive


than
 I
 am
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 just
 like


dealing
 with
 with
 feedback
 and
 stuff
 and


like
 you
 know
 even
 at
 her
 job
 if
 she


gets
 negative
 feedback
 it's
 like
 it's


stuff
 that
 like
 affects
 her
 mentally
 and


emotionally.


And
 so
 she
 was
 like
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with


like
 just
 people
 throwing
 their
 opinions


at
 you
 every
 day
 and
 saying
 this
 saying


that.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 you
 got
 you
 got
 to


you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 isolate
 yourself


to
 also
 understand
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


that
 people
 say
 is
 just
 people
 saying


stuff,
 including
 myself.
 People
 say


whatever
 they
 want
 to
 say,
 right?
 People


will
 always
 say
 whatever
 they
 want
 to


say.
 It
 it
 cannot
 be
 something
 that


define
 it
 cannot
 be
 something
 you
 lose


sleep
 over.
 It
 really
 can't.
 And
 it


should
 only
 be
 something
 you
 lose
 sleep


over
 if
 you
 think
 that
 what
 they're


saying
 is
 so
 accurate
 or
 so
 right
 or
 you


know
 you've
 done
 something
 so
 wrong
 and


that
 but
 if
 you're
 just
 being
 yourself


like
 yeah
 you're
 not
 perfect
 but
 people


can
 say
 whatever
 they
 want
 to
 say.
 It's


it's
 at
 the
 core.
 Are
 you
 building


something
 real?
 Is
 there
 something


legit?
 And
 do
 people
 understand
 that?


And
 I
 think
 the
 numbers
 of,
 you
 know,


the
 viewers
 every
 day
 is
 just
 the


validation
 of
 that
 more
 than
 anything,


even
 if
 not
 everyone
 will
 always
 agree.


Uh,
 first
 trillion,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Just
 went
 through
 a
 breakup.


These
 streams
 really
 help
 with
 the


emotional
 emotional
 turmoil.
 Honestly


though,
 really
 grateful
 for
 the


community
 here.
 See
 the
 these
 are
 the


comments
 that
 mean
 the
 most
 to
 me


because
 because
 uh
 you
 know
 content
 I


think
 is
 a
 form
 of
 escapism
 as
 well
 and


uh
 you
 know
 whether
 it's
 a
 live
 stream


or
 whether
 it's
 a
 Netflix
 show
 anything


that
 can
 be
 that
 form
 of
 escapism


especially
 if
 you're
 because
 everyone's


going
 to
 go
 through
 some
 [ __ ]
 in
 life


whether
 it's
 a
 breakup
 or
 anything
 right


and
 you're
 always
 going
 to
 need
 some


level
 of
 community
 whether
 it's
 physical


or
 whether
 it's
 online
 to
 kind
 of


navigate
 through
 that
 because
 life
 is


hard
 life
 is
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 thing
 we


all
 forget
 life
 is
 tough
 bro
 we
 all


forget
 that
 [ __ ]
 Life
 is
 Wow.
 S&P.


Well,
 life's
 not
 that
 tough
 when
 we're


breaking
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P.
 There


you
 go.
 678,
 baby.
 Look
 at
 that.
 678
 on


the
 S&P.
 Up
 almost
 1%
 on
 the
 day.


There
 you
 go.


But
 life
 is
 hard.
 I
 think
 we
 all
 forget


sometimes.
 Life
 is
 like
 there's
 so
 much


[ __ ]
 we
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 with
 life.


And
 it's
 like
 just
 just
 being
 able
 to
 uh


to
 sit
 back
 and
 and
 know
 that
 you
 have
 a


group
 of
 people
 that
 that
 have
 your


back,
 right?
 And
 that
 that
 care
 about


you
 and
 that
 that
 actually
 want
 to


engage.


And
 I
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 I
 mean
 like
 the


fact
 that
 people
 even
 say
 happy
 birthday


to
 random
 people
 in
 the
 chat,
 you
 know,


someone
 in
 the
 chat
 said,
 "I
 just
 had
 a


baby
 girl.
 I
 just
 had,
 you
 know,
 I
 just


had
 a
 newborn."
 and
 people
 are


supportive
 like
 like
 that
 that's
 the


part
 that
 makes
 it
 really
 cool
 because


it
 like
 because
 then
 when
 you
 meet
 in


person
 it's
 like
 a
 legit
 uh
 a
 sense
 of


like
 emotional
 connection
 to
 these


people
 these
 quote
 unquote
 strangers
 in


the
 chat
 but
 it
 happens
 because
 because


there's
 a
 community
 and
 then
 if
 we
 all


get
 to
 make
 money
 together
 as
 the
 S&Ps


at
 678
 that
 also
 helps
 as
 well


which
 is
 nice


thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel
 member


appreciate
 it
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here


um
 and
 and
 Santo
 to
 thank
 you
 for


becoming
 a
 channel
 member
 as
 well.


Uh
 Oriel,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I


appreciate
 what
 you
 do.
 I've
 watched


your
 videos
 more
 than
 any
 other
 media.
 I


feel
 you
 genuinely
 care
 about
 your


followers.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 just


care
 I
 love
 the
 game
 of
 content
 creation


and
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 why
 the


channel
 has
 been
 successful.
 Like
 I


really
 do
 not
 care
 about
 the
 money


aspect
 of
 it.
 Obviously,
 this
 is
 a


business
 and
 you
 want
 to
 turn
 it
 into


something
 that's
 profitable
 long
 term


and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But
 again,
 my


philosophy
 has
 always
 been
 that
 building


a
 brand
 will
 eventually
 allow
 you
 to


make
 more
 money
 than
 the
 monetization
 of


the
 audience
 in
 that
 brand
 ever
 could.


And
 I
 think
 that
 thesis
 has
 been
 proven


to
 be
 very
 accurate.
 Like,
 but
 the
 only


people
 who
 can
 survive
 via
 that
 mindset,


aka
 I
 will
 make
 my
 money
 on
 the
 back


end.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 make
 my
 money
 on


the
 front
 end,
 are
 people
 that
 love


doing
 the
 work
 because
 they
 just
 enjoy


the
 process
 of
 the
 game
 and
 they
 know


that
 eventually
 the
 money
 will
 find


them.
 And
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 the


channel
 is
 is
 working.
 So


S&P
 678,
 dude,
 she's
 not
 stopping.
 Look


at
 that.
 67830.


She's
 not
 freaking
 stopping.


Some
 of
 us
 even
 overshare.


Yeah,
 it's
 part
 of
 it.
 It's
 part
 of
 it.


Matt
 says,
 "The
 people
 I
 met
 in
 Miami


were
 absolutely
 awesome.
 I'm
 sure
 the


other
 towns
 are
 just
 as
 great."
 Dude,
 it


is
 really
 cool.
 The
 meetups
 are
 a
 lot
 of


work
 and
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 work


behind
 the
 scenes.
 But
 I
 like
 every
 time


I
 think
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 work
 that
 needs


to
 go
 into
 it,
 which
 is
 a
 bit
 daunting


because
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]
 to
 do.
 I


remember
 that
 like
 the
 the
 the
 feeling


of
 everyone
 being
 there
 at
 once,
 it
 is


so
 special
 and
 I
 just
 want
 everyone
 to


one
 day
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 experience
 it.


So,
 we
 got
 to
 put
 in
 the
 work
 to
 to
 make


it
 happen.


But
 hopefully
 it
 will
 in
 uh
 in
 2026.


All right,
 cool.
 I
 think
 that's
 it.


Thank
 everybody.
 Got
 the
 S&P
 making


all-time
 highs.
 Bitcoin,
 are
 we
 kind
 of


following
 Bitcoin
 at
 110?
 Ethereum


trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 4,000.


I
 think
 we
 can
 end
 out
 the
 day
 at


alltime
 highs
 at
 least
 above
 673.


And
 if
 so,
 that
 would
 be
 really
 bullish


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 I


think
 Steve
 will
 be
 on
 on
 the
 close.


We'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 See


if
 we
 have
 any
 other
 headlines


and
 if
 so,
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


John,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Congrats
 on
 your
 accomplishment
 with
 the


YouTube
 milestone
 new
 apartment.
 Love


every
 live
 call
 and
 finally
 broke
 70k


from
 11k
 in
 April.
 Wow.
 11
 to75.


I
 mean
 the
 markets
 again
 they
 have
 they


have
 just
 been
 incredible
 this
 year
 and


really
 it's
 been
 a
 retail
 story
 because


the
 only
 people
 that
 were
 buying
 in


April
 were
 retail
 investors.


So
 incredible
 incredible
 stuff
 across


the
 entire
 board.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


market
 close.
 Uh,
 if
 I
 don't
 see
 you
 on


the
 close,
 I'll
 see
 you
 Sunday
 for
 the


future
 stream.
 Um,


and
 yeah,
 if
 I
 don't
 see
 you
 Sunday,


then
 I'll
 see
 you
 Monday
 for
 the
 market


open.
 And
 next
 week
 is
 a
 crazy
 week.


SoFi,
 FOMC,
 Google,
 Meta,
 Apple,


Microsoft,
 Amazon.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive
 week,
 but
 it'll
 be
 fun
 and
 we're


going
 to
 keep
 navigating
 it
 every
 single


day.


All
 right,
 thanks
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 market


close.
 Bye
 everyone.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
