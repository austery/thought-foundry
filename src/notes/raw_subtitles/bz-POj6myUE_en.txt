You've
 also
 built
 a
 custom
 GBT
 to
 make


sure
 that
 your
 writing
 is
 concise.
 So,


can
 you
 show
 us
 a
 little bit
 of
 what


that
 looks
 like?


I've
 been
 giving
 feedback
 multiple
 times


and
 my
 writing
 is
 good,
 but
 it
 can
 be


really
 long.
 So,
 my
 Slack
 messages
 on


updates
 and
 channels
 are
 really
 long
 and


it's
 hard
 for
 people
 to
 get
 through.
 And


Lenny
 released
 a
 newsletter
 where
 you


had
 Wes
 Cow
 say
 her
 recommendations
 on


how
 to
 write
 concisely,
 how
 to
 deliver


message.
 Well,
 I
 took
 these
 newsletters,


I
 command
 Ped
 it,
 downloaded
 them,
 and
 I


put
 it
 into
 a
 custom
 GPT
 as
 my


guidelines
 to
 how
 to
 write.
 And
 then
 you


have
 this
 here,
 this
 instructions.
 GPT


rewrites
 Slack
 messages
 to
 be
 more


concise,
 to
 be
 more
 clear,
 to
 be


readable,
 maintains
 the
 natural
 voice
 of


the
 user
 because
 I
 want
 anyone
 in
 my


company,
 anyone
 in
 general
 to
 use
 this


GPT
 so
 it
 doesn't
 like
 make
 it
 super
 AI,


avoid
 too
 much
 dashes,
 don't
 give
 so


much
 bullet
 points,
 all
 that
 stuff
 like


that.
 And
 then
 I
 come
 into
 here
 so


often,
 I'll
 write
 a
 message
 out
 on
 Slack


to
 like
 myself.
 I'll
 copy
 it,
 paste
 it


in
 here,
 and
 it
 does
 a
 really
 good
 job


of
 making
 it
 super
 concise,
 sticking
 to


these
 guidelines
 up,
 delivering
 to
 the


point,
 having
 a
 really
 good
 follow-up


and
 leadup
 as
 to
 what
 the
 next
 section


will
 be.
 It
 is
 a
 lifesaver.
