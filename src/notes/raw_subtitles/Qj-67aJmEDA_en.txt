You've
 actually
 set
 up
 these


independent,
 fully
 loaded
 brains
 in


Claude
 and
 Chat
 GPT
 and
 then
 use
 those


to
 hold
 the
 context
 for
 you
 and
 be
 more


efficient
 with
 your
 job.
 So,
 show
 us


what
 one
 of
 these
 brains
 actually
 looks


like.


Yeah,
 let's
 dive
 right
 into
 it.
 So,


here's
 an
 example
 of
 a
 project.
 You
 can


see
 here
 that
 I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 them.


And
 in
 it,
 we
 have
 my
 files
 and
 my


instructions.
 Right
 now,
 there's
 20


files.
 It
 started
 with
 two
 or
 three
 or


four
 and
 then
 just
 kept
 growing
 and


growing
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 pre.
 This
 is


what
 all
 the
 projects
 look
 like.
 They


all
 just
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 files,


instructions
 and
 you
 can
 see
 my
 endless


amount
 of
 threads
 that
 I
 have
 with
 it.


Okay.
 So,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are


important
 files
 for
 a
 product
 manager
 to


put
 in?


So,
 I
 usually
 kick
 it
 off
 with
 a
 ping


pong.
 So,
 I
 give
 it
 any
 data
 that
 I


have.
 If
 there
 is
 anything
 that


references
 as
 to
 what
 exactly
 is
 going


on
 to
 start
 things
 off,
 then
 it
 helps
 me


and
 the
 thread
 that
 I'm
 having
 here
 in


projects
 get
 an
 understanding
 as
 to
 what


I'm
 looking
 to
 achieve
 and
 more


realistic
 what
 we're
 talking
 about.

Welcome
 back
 to
 how
 I
 AI.
 I'm
 Clarvo,


product
 leader
 and
 AI
 obsessive
 here
 on


a
 mission
 to
 help
 you
 build
 better
 with


these
 new
 tools.
 Today
 I
 have
 AI
 PM
 Amir


Klein
 who
 works
 at
 monday.com
 and
 is
 in


the
 top
 five
 AI
 powered
 PMs
 on
 his
 team.


He's
 going
 to
 show
 us
 how
 he
 uses
 AI
 to


build
 scrapers
 to
 get
 customer
 feedback


into
 his
 custom
 GPTs,
 use
 those
 custom


GPTs
 to
 not
 only
 make
 his
 product
 sense


better,
 but
 improve
 feedback
 that
 he's


gotten
 from
 his
 boss.
 And
 finally,
 he
 is


the
 first
 guest
 that
 will
 demo
 Voice


Mode
 live
 for
 us
 on
 air
 to
 show
 how
 he


prepares
 for
 product
 interviews.
 Let's


get
 to
 it.
 This
 episode
 is
 brought

 giving
 funds,
 the
 zero


fee
 daff.

 fund.
 Hey
 Omir,


happy
 to
 have
 you
 here.


Thank
 you
 Claire.
 Happy
 to
 be
 here.
 So,


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 I'm
 excited
 to


have
 you
 here
 is
 you
 don't
 just
 like


using
 AI.
 We
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 it.


You
 are
 now
 highly
 dependent
 and
 maybe


incapable
 of
 doing
 your
 job
 without
 AI.


So,
 tell
 me
 how
 you
 got
 to
 this
 point


where
 you're
 really
 depending
 on
 AI
 to


do
 your
 job
 as
 an
 AI
 PM.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 like
 the
 whole


context
 switching
 um
 is
 something
 that's


really
 difficult
 for
 everyone.
 And
 as
 a


PM,
 when
 you're
 going
 back
 toback


meetings
 and
 jumping
 between
 different


initiatives
 and
 different
 requirements


and
 asks
 from
 people,
 you
 have
 so
 many


things
 to
 juggle
 that
 I
 discovered
 with


the
 help
 of
 everything
 that's
 out
 there


online
 that
 you
 can
 silo
 like
 brains
 of


conversations
 and
 threads
 in
 GPT
 and


cloud
 that
 it
 made
 me
 super
 dependent
 on


it
 in
 order
 to
 just
 do
 my
 work.
 And
 I'm


doing
 it
 really
 well.
 I
 think
 I'm
 doing


really
 efficiently.
 So
 that's
 how
 I
 got


to
 where
 I
 am
 today.


Okay.
 So
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 you
 like


all
 PMs
 have
 to
 context
 switch
 and
 hold


a
 million
 different
 threads
 in
 your
 mind


at
 one
 time.
 And
 instead
 of
 burdening


your
 poor
 human
 brain
 with
 all
 that


contact
 switching,
 you've
 actually
 set


up
 these
 like
 independent
 fully
 loaded


brains
 in
 Claude
 and
 chat
 GBT
 and
 then


use
 those
 to
 hold
 the
 context
 for
 you


and
 be
 more
 efficient
 with
 your
 job.


Absolutely.
 Now,


okay.
 So,
 show
 us
 what
 one
 of
 these


brains
 actually
 looks
 like.
 What
 are


some
 of
 the
 use
 cases
 for
 my
 collection


my
 file
 folder
 of
 of
 brains?
 Yeah,
 let's


dive
 right
 into
 it.
 Um,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to


I
 guess
 dive
 into
 what
 a
 I
 guess
 folder


looks
 like,
 my
 projects
 look
 like.


So
 here's
 an
 example
 of
 um
 a
 project.


You
 can
 see
 here
 that
 I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


them.
 And
 in
 it,
 we
 have
 like
 my
 files


and
 my
 instructions.
 Um,
 so
 right
 now


there's
 20
 files.
 It
 started
 with
 two
 or


three
 or
 four
 and
 then
 just
 kept
 growing


and
 growing
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 brain.
 And


I'll
 dive
 into
 like
 some
 of
 the
 files


that
 are
 in
 here
 and
 kind
 of
 like
 what


I'm
 trying
 to
 achieve
 to
 help
 you


understand
 like
 how
 I
 put
 this
 into


action,
 but
 just
 this
 is
 what
 all
 the


projects
 look
 like.
 They
 all
 just
 have
 a


lot
 of
 files,
 instructions,
 and
 you
 can


see
 like
 my
 endless
 amount
 of
 threads


that
 I
 have
 with
 it
 um
 like
 non-stop.


Okay.
 So
 what
 do
 you
 think
 are
 important


files
 for
 a
 product
 manager
 to
 put
 in
 or


what
 are
 some
 unique
 sources
 of
 you
 know


context
 for
 these
 GPT
 projects
 that
 you


have
 found
 particularly
 useful
 or


unique?


It
 varies
 obviously
 on
 what
 you're


working
 on
 but
 I
 always
 start
 with
 some


sort
 of
 like
 reference
 that
 it
 can


understand
 whatever
 is
 that
 I'm
 starting


with.
 So
 I
 usually
 kick
 it
 off
 with
 a


ping
 pong.
 So
 I
 give
 it
 any
 data
 that
 I


have
 any
 data
 whatsoever.
 So,
 if
 there's


a
 company
 kickoff
 deck,
 if
 there's
 a


team
 kickoff
 deck,
 if
 there's
 another


reference
 to
 a
 PR,
 if
 there
 is
 anything


that
 um
 references
 as
 to
 what
 exactly
 is


going
 on
 to
 start
 things
 off,
 then
 it


helps
 like
 me
 and
 the
 thread
 that
 I'm


having
 here
 in
 projects
 get
 an


understanding
 as
 to
 what
 I'm
 looking
 to


achieve
 and
 more
 what
 we're
 talking


about.


Great.
 And
 then
 what
 do
 you
 want
 these,


you
 know,
 second
 brains
 or
 these
 GPTs
 to


actually
 do
 for
 you?
 So,
 what
 is
 the,


you
 know,
 what
 does
 this
 one
 actually
 do


for
 you?


I'll
 start
 this
 one
 kind
 of
 like
 where


it
 began.
 Um,
 I
 started
 at
 my
 company
 at


monday.com
 leading
 like
 the
 AI
 agents
 uh


team,
 the
 whole
 initiative
 there.
 And


I'm
 sure
 anyone
 who's
 on
 AI
 today
 can


allude
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 AI
 agents
 is


probably
 like
 one
 of
 the
 most
 fantasized


thing
 that
 is
 in
 SAS.
 Everybody
 wants


it.
 Everybody
 wants
 it
 to
 work.


Everybody
 has
 like
 this
 vision
 of
 what


it
 can
 do
 and
 it
 can
 do
 everything
 and


whatever
 you
 hear
 outside
 is
 also
 what


you
 hear
 inside.
 And
 there's
 a
 thousand


different
 voices
 and
 different
 opinions


of
 where
 they
 want
 it
 to
 go
 and
 what


they
 believe
 it
 will
 be.
 And
 I
 was


seeking
 some
 voice
 of
 reason
 that
 was


unbiased.
 I
 was
 looking
 for


conversations
 that
 people
 were
 having


that
 weren't
 connected
 to
 my
 company


that
 didn't
 have
 any
 specific


narrative
 they
 wanted
 to
 go
 down.
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 know
 what
 people
 are


interested
 in,
 what
 they
 expect,
 and


what
 they
 want.
 Um,
 which
 is
 what
 led
 me


to
 Reddit.


Okay.
 So,
 you
 were
 a
 PM.
 You
 were
 given


the
 great
 and
 wonderful
 task
 of
 building


out
 agents.
 No
 one
 has
 agreed
 on
 what


the
 definition
 of
 an
 agent
 is.
 No
 one


has
 agreed
 what
 the
 agent
 should
 do.
 No


one
 really
 understands
 if
 customers


actually
 even
 want
 agents.
 Technically


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 complexity
 and
 um


aspirationally
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 goals


around
 these.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 very
 common


product
 manager
 problem
 where
 you're


given
 a
 big
 meaty
 interesting


technically
 complex
 problem
 with
 a
 lot


of
 hopes
 and
 dreams
 in
 it
 and
 then
 it's


your
 job
 to
 go
 make
 it
 reality.
 And
 so


what
 I'm
 hearing
 from
 you
 is
 you
 went


and
 sought
 out
 these
 different
 resources


um
 that
 were
 external
 that
 could
 give


you
 more
 of
 an
 unbiased
 filter
 on
 which


to
 make
 some
 product
 decisions
 and
 maybe


even
 go
 kind
 of
 back
 to
 your
 leadership


partners
 or
 people
 with
 big
 hopes
 and


dreams
 and
 say
 this
 is
 what
 people


actually
 want
 or
 this
 is
 what's
 actually


possible.
 And
 so
 you
 mentioned
 Reddit.


What
 did
 you
 actually
 pull
 from
 Reddit


that
 you
 think
 was
 so
 useful
 here?
 So,


I'm
 going
 to
 walk
 you
 through
 like
 what


I
 did
 here
 in
 order
 to
 scrape


conversations
 on
 Reddit
 uh
 with
 the
 help


of
 Claude.
 I
 had
 this
 idea.
 I
 had
 this


vision
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


this
 file
 or
 many
 files
 containing


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 conversations


that
 people
 have
 about
 anything
 that
 I


wanted.
 In
 this
 case,
 I
 wanted
 about


agents,
 AI,
 money.com,
 all
 in
 relation


with
 one
 another.
 Um,
 so
 I
 went
 into
 I


went
 into
 uh
 to
 cloud
 and
 I
 said,
 "Here,


help
 me
 help
 me
 scrape
 conversations."
 I


started
 my
 conversation
 here
 with
 just


like
 I
 want
 to
 find
 everything
 that's


written
 aboutmoney.com
 whether
 it
 be
 on


Reddit,
 Twitter,
 LinkedIn,
 anything


that's
 online.
 Um,
 and
 I
 wanted
 like
 a


sort
 of
 an
 automated
 free
 way
 to
 do


this.
 So,
 it
 went
 into
 like
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 options.
 We
 realized
 that


LinkedIn
 and
 Twitter
 have
 like
 more


limited
 APIs.
 Some
 of
 them
 are
 like


paid.
 Eventually,
 we
 got
 down
 to
 what
 I


needed,
 how
 to
 get
 it,
 and
 how
 can
 do
 it


more
 automated.
 So,
 I
 asked,
 "Okay,


great.
 We
 know
 Reddit
 is
 the
 place
 I


need
 to
 be.
 Now,
 give
 me
 a
 step-by-step


guide
 of
 what
 I
 need
 to
 do."
 So,
 I'm
 not


not
 technical.
 I
 am
 a
 little
 bit
 I
 have


a
 little
 bit
 of
 experience
 with
 things.


Um,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 I'm
 not


skipping
 any
 steps.
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 everything
 I'm
 doing
 here
 is
 going


to
 be
 exactly
 what
 needs
 to
 be
 done


because
 I
 had
 a
 vision
 of
 what
 I'm


getting
 out
 of
 this
 here.
 So,
 it


literally
 walks
 me
 through
 here
 like


open
 Safari,
 go
 to
 Brew,
 write
 a


command,
 open
 your
 terminal,
 write
 like


literally
 step
 by
 step
 of
 what
 I
 need
 to


do
 as
 if
 I'm
 5
 years
 old
 and
 I
 don't


know
 how
 to
 uh
 program
 or
 code
 anything,


which
 was
 fantastic.
 It
 tells
 me
 to
 go


into
 Reddit,
 go
 into
 this,
 make
 make
 a
 a


developer
 account.
 I
 literally
 follow


the
 step
 by
 step.
 I
 didn't
 even
 try


changing
 any
 name.
 I
 literally
 did
 as
 as


it
 asked.
 And
 then
 we
 get
 to,
 you
 know,


doing
 brew
 install.
 It's
 getting
 stuck,


whatever.
 Eventually,
 we
 get
 to
 the
 good


stuff
 where
 I
 have
 everything
 set
 up.


Um,
 it's
 finished.
 Now,
 what
 do
 I
 do?
 I


had
 the
 environment
 set
 up
 and
 I
 had
 all


the
 packages
 that
 I
 need
 to
 set
 up.
 And


now
 it
 starts
 giving
 me
 like
 all
 these


commands
 to
 run.
 So
 install
 different


packages
 and
 libraries
 that
 I
 need
 in


order
 to
 run
 the
 script
 that
 I
 write
 for


me.
 Here's
 a
 script
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


help
 you
 write
 and
 let's
 get
 started.
 So


basically
 it
 writes
 me
 up
 this
 script
 we


can
 see
 over
 here


where
 it
 I
 put
 in
 my
 client
 ID
 would
 ask


me
 to
 take
 out
 from
 Reddit
 my
 client


secret
 and
 my
 username.
 Um
 and
 then
 it


scrapes
 everything
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with


like
 Monday
 with
 things
 that
 I'm
 looking


for
 with
 AI
 and
 whatever
 it
 be.
 Um,
 and


lo
 and
 behold,
 came
 out
 a
 file
 with


34,000
 rows
 of
 conversations.


Okay.
 So,
 you
 had
 this
 like
 very
 again
 a


very
 classic
 product
 manager
 problem
 of


I
 know
 people
 are
 talking
 about
 this


product.
 Like
 I
 I
 know
 I
 know
 there's


information
 out
 there
 and
 I
 can
 manually


call
 through
 and
 you
 know
 do
 Reddit


searches
 and
 search
 through
 Twitter,
 but


I
 want
 to
 do
 this
 in
 a
 programmatic
 way.


I'm
 technical
 but
 not
 that
 technical
 and


dear
 God
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 write
 a
 bunch


of
 Python.
 And
 so
 what
 you
 did
 is
 you


went
 to
 Claude
 and
 you
 said,
 "I
 have


this
 general
 problem.
 I
 just
 want
 to


know
 what's
 out
 there."
 You
 actually


said
 the
 prompt
 is
 really
 interesting.


It
 says,
 "I
 want
 to
 know
 everything
 out


there."
 Everything
 everyone
 is
 saying.


That's
 a
 very
 broad
 ambition.


Yeah.
 Very
 ambitious
 flow.


And
 then,
 you
 know,
 Claude
 narrowed
 you


into,
 well,
 here
 are
 the
 actual


accessible
 sources
 of
 data
 for
 you.
 And


then
 you
 wrote
 a
 script
 to
 go
 pull
 all


that
 Reddit
 data.
 And
 then
 what
 did
 you


do
 with
 that?
 Yeah,
 you
 said
 34,000
 or


something.
 3,400
 um
 line
 spreadsheet.


What
 did
 what
 did
 you
 do
 with
 that
 data?


Um
 so
 I'll
 show
 you
 basically
 first
 of


all
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 what
 the
 file


looks
 like
 just
 so
 you
 get
 a
 glimpse
 as


to
 what
 this
 like
 monstrous
 file
 is.
 So


this
 is
 what
 34,000


rows
 of
 threads
 looks
 like
 um
 in


relation
 to
 the
 conversations
 that
 I


wanted,
 the
 theme
 that
 I
 was
 looking


for.
 So
 this
 is
 great.
 Um,
 and
 it
 really


helps
 me
 understand.
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of


conversations.
 I
 also
 went
 crazy
 with


it.
 I
 said
 like,
 "Give
 me
 different


files.
 Show
 me
 how
 it
 looks
 like
 in


compar
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 competitors.
 Show


me
 conversations
 that
 are
 happening
 like


in
 relation
 to
 our
 competitors
 like


comparing
 us
 to
 any
 other
 competitor
 and


their
 AI
 and
 give
 me
 some
 sort
 of
 idea."


When
 I
 had
 all
 that
 information,
 I
 went


back
 into
 Claude
 and
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 now


be
 my
 analyst."
 Um,
 and
 start
 breaking


this
 down.
 I'm
 like
 really
 into
 data.


Um,
 I
 have
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 data


background.
 So,
 I
 came
 into
 it
 and
 I


said,
 "Here,
 I'm
 giving
 you
 this
 this


file.
 This
 is
 one
 of the
 files
 that
 was


pulled
 out
 with
 30,000
 rows
 of


conversations."
 And
 I
 said,
 "I
 want
 you


to
 summarize
 it
 in
 a
 table
 where
 you
 put


like
 the
 frequency."
 So,
 how
 often
 it


comes
 up
 at
 what
 percentage.
 I
 need


weights
 because
 I
 need
 numbers
 to
 go


back
 to
 my
 team
 and
 for
 myself
 to
 know


what
 to
 prioritize,
 see
 what
 the
 biggest


hottest
 topics
 are
 that
 people
 are
 are


discussing
 and
 some
 of
 the
 key


discussion
 points.
 and
 out
 comes
 this


table
 which
 is
 really
 nice


and
 really
 helpful
 because
 I
 have
 okay


here's
 here's
 a
 here's
 some
 sort
 of
 idea


I
 know
 like
 what
 are
 the
 top
 five
 areas


that
 people
 are
 wishing
 and
 hoping
 and


having
 conversations
 about
 around
 this


their
 expectation
 and
 their
 dreams


around
 what
 AI
 or
 an
 agent
 would
 do


and
 did
 you
 find
 that
 this
 did
 you
 spot


check
 this
 at
 all
 did
 you
 just
 trust
 it


did
 you
 feel
 like
 this
 was
 relatively


accurate
 based
 on
 what
 you
 saw
 in
 that


in
 that
 spreadsheet


yeah
 it's
 a
 really
 good
 question
 um
 I


did
 check
 it
 obviously
 I'm
 not
 checking


34
 4,000
 rows
 of
 conversations.
 But
 um
 I


did
 do
 like
 keyword
 searches
 and
 I


looked
 at
 different
 threads
 and


conversations
 that
 I
 pulled
 up.
 Also


what
 I
 typically
 do
 with
 whenever
 I
 ask


GBT
 or
 Claude
 to
 analyze
 something,
 I


say
 reference,
 give
 me
 at least
 one
 or


two
 quotes
 as
 to
 where
 this
 came
 up
 from


and
 I
 have
 tons
 of
 conversations
 where


it
 does
 that.
 So
 then
 I
 fact
 check
 it.
 I


copy
 that.
 I
 go
 back
 into


document
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


actually
 there.


Awesome.
 And
 so
 you
 built
 this
 scraper,


you
 took
 the
 data,
 you
 analyzed
 it.
 Did


you
 then
 feed
 this
 analysis
 back
 into


that
 GPT
 project
 we
 saw
 before?
 Kind
 of


how
 does
 this
 become
 part
 of
 your
 corpus


of
 one
 of
 your
 secondary
 brains?


Yeah,
 fantastic.
 So
 I'll
 show
 you
 um
 how


that
 looks
 like
 back
 in
 the
 project


itself.
 So
 here
 I
 am
 in
 the
 project.
 Um,


you
 can
 see
 that
 I
 have
 like
 the
 thread


like
 the
 AI
 threads
 on
 Reddit
 and
 in


general
 like
 these
 are
 different
 like


Reddit
 th
 files
 that
 I
 had
 and
 this
 is


how
 I
 started
 things
 off.
 I
 had
 my


kickoff
 that
 I
 had
 um
 that
 my
 manager


did
 and
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 of
 pages
 that


like
 I
 took
 from
 our
 site
 of
 like
 how


Monday
 works
 and
 I
 just
 command
 Ped
 it


so
 it's
 a
 PDF
 and
 put
 in
 another
 classic


example
 of
 everything
 is
 text


and
 then
 it
 so
 it
 has
 an
 idea.
 It
 knows


what
 Monday
 is.
 in
 know
 what
 in
 more
 or


less
 like
 what
 our
 goal
 is
 as
 a
 team
 and


here
 are
 some
 conversations
 that
 are


happening
 so
 you
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 idea


as
 to
 what
 people's
 dreams
 and
 hopes
 are


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI.
 Yeah,
 I
 just
 want


to
 call
 out
 that
 little
 trick
 for
 folks


that
 may
 might
 have
 missed
 it
 because
 I


do
 the
 exact
 same
 thing,
 which
 is
 I


actually
 just
 use
 our
 marketing
 website


or
 our
 support
 website
 and
 I
 just
 print


things
 as
 PDFs
 and
 download
 them
 and


then
 upload
 them
 to
 GPT
 projects
 or


whatever
 kind
 of
 store
 because
 then
 I


know
 it's
 scoped
 to
 that
 specific
 piece


of
 content.
 I've
 done
 it
 a
 lot
 with
 like


support
 pages.
 I've
 done
 it
 with
 the


homepage
 obviously
 because
 that's


usually
 like
 the
 source
 of
 truth
 of
 your


your
 positioning.
 And
 then
 I
 do
 it
 a
 lot


with
 like
 pricing
 pages.
 So,
 I'll
 go


like
 print
 a
 bunch
 of
 competitor
 pricing


pages


and
 drop
 them
 in
 a
 GPT.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 a
 really
 great
 source
 of


information
 for
 a
 GPT.


No,
 for
 sure.
 I
 think
 like
 once
 you
 like


when
 I
 started
 with
 this
 and
 I
 had
 the


CSV
 file
 from
 from
 um
 Reddit,


my
 mind
 was
 like,
 okay,
 literally


everything
 is
 text.
 So,
 like
 even
 you


may
 not
 necessarily
 think
 of
 like
 a


slide.
 It
 was
 a
 slide
 from
 like
 Google


Slides
 as
 like
 text,
 but
 it
 is.
 So
 you


just
 download
 as
 a
 PDF
 and
 you
 have
 just


like
 whatever
 it
 is,
 however
 many
 slides


here
 as
 a
 reference.
 Um
 and
 like
 the


example
 that
 you
 said
 as
 well
 like
 the


list
 is
 endless
 of
 what
 is
 text.
 So
 I


have
 it
 all
 through
 like
 instructions


more
 or
 less
 of
 like
 what
 I
 want
 to
 do.


Uh
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 is
 a
 professional


in
 product
 management
 and
 expert
 and
 all


this
 stuff.
 It
 has
 a
 good
 product


strategy
 mindset
 and
 product
 sense


mindset.
 Um,
 I
 also
 gave
 it
 like
 a
 lot


of
 like
 instructions
 on,
 you
 know,
 you


know,
 how
 to
 give
 feedback
 to
 me,
 you


know,
 how
 to
 give
 candid
 feedback
 and


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 like
 too
 nice
 to


me,
 you
 know,
 to
 challenge


because
 I
 hate
 it
 when
 the
 AI
 will
 be


like
 super
 supportive
 of
 every
 idea
 that


I
 come
 up
 with.
 Like
 push
 back
 on


things.
 You
 have
 the
 knowledge,
 so
 feel


free
 to
 challenge
 me
 on
 things
 that
 I


come
 up
 with
 and
 then
 the
 ping
 pong


begins
 and
 then
 we
 start
 going
 back
 and


forth
 and
 I
 have
 a
 thousands
 of


conversations
 here.


And
 so
 are
 you
 using
 this
 as
 a
 thought


partner?
 Are
 you
 using
 this
 to
 prep
 for


meetings
 with
 your
 boss?
 Like
 what
 are


the
 most
 common
 use
 cases
 for
 this
 GBT


for
 you?


All
 my
 projects
 I
 start
 with
 a
 scope.
 I


want
 to
 get
 to
 some
 sort
 of
 like
 outline


overview
 that
 will
 help
 me
 with
 PPRD


with
 a
 product
 review
 with
 some


something
 that
 I
 can
 deliver
 to
 my
 team.


So
 narrative.
 So
 it
 always
 starts
 off


with
 a
 ping
 pong
 always.
 And
 then
 once


I've
 gone
 into
 some
 sort
 of
 document
 and


I
 have
 like
 this
 overview
 doc
 of
 what
 it


is,
 I
 played
 around
 with
 it.
 I
 download


it
 and
 I
 put
 it
 back
 into
 its
 knowledge.


And
 now
 it
 has
 that
 as
 a
 basis
 and
 then


it
 goes
 from
 there.
 The
 more
 work
 I
 do


with
 it,
 the
 more
 knowledge
 I
 add
 into


it
 uh
 into
 its
 files.
 And
 then


everything
 that
 comes
 after
 that
 is
 just


super
 intuitive
 and
 fluid.
 I'll
 give
 you


examples
 like
 if
 I
 need
 to
 write


something,
 how
 often
 I
 get
 asked


questions
 by
 like
 marketing
 and
 with
 the


communications
 theme
 of
 like,
 okay,


you're
 releasing
 something.
 Can
 you
 give


me
 like
 a
 twoline
 sentence
 is
 what
 it


is.
 Those
 are
 classic
 examples
 of
 like


catch
 me
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day
 on


Slack
 and
 ask
 me
 then.
 I'm
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 think
 about


that,
 but
 here
 is
 something
 that
 has
 a


brain
 for
 this.
 I
 ask
 it
 that
 question


and
 it
 usually
 does
 a
 pretty
 good
 job


and
 then
 lo
 and
 behold,
 here
 we
 go.


Great.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 speaking
 of


documents,
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 common


complaints
 that,
 you
 know,
 people
 have


about
 AI
 generated
 documents
 is
 the


writing
 maybe
 isn't
 great.
 And
 at
 the


very
 least,
 maybe
 it's
 good
 thinking,


but
 it's
 quite
 long.
 And
 I
 know
 you've


also
 built
 a
 custom
 GBT
 to
 make
 sure


that
 your
 writing
 is
 concise.
 So,
 can


you
 show
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 what
 that


looks
 like?


Yeah,
 there's
 al
 also
 a
 background
 to


that.
 Um,
 so
 if
 any
 of
 my
 past
 managers


and
 colleagues
 see
 this,
 um,
 they
 will


be
 able
 to
 confirm
 this,
 but
 I've
 been


giving
 feedback
 multiple
 times
 and
 my


writing
 is
 good,
 but
 it
 can
 be
 really


long.
 So,
 my
 Slack
 messages
 on
 updates


and
 channels
 are
 really
 long
 and


it's
 hard
 for
 people
 to
 get
 through.
 And


Lenny
 released
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a


newsletter
 where
 you
 had
 Wescow
 like
 say


more
 or
 less
 like
 her
 recommendations
 on


how
 to
 write
 concisely,
 how
 to
 deliver


message
 well.
 And
 again
 example
 here
 of


everything
 is
 written.
 Um
 I
 took
 these


newsletters,
 I
 command
 Ped
 it,


downloaded
 them
 and
 I
 put
 it
 into
 a


custom
 GPT
 as
 like
 my
 guidelines
 to
 how


to
 write.
 Um
 and
 I'll
 show
 you
 what
 this


custom
 GPT
 looks
 like.


You've
 seen
 the
 doom
 and
 gloom


headlines.
 AI
 is
 coming
 for
 your
 job.


But
 the
 reality
 is
 a
 little
 bit


brighter.
 In
 Miro's
 latest
 survey,
 76%


of
 people
 say
 AI
 can
 boost
 their
 work.


It's
 just
 that
 54%
 still
 don't
 know
 when


to
 use
 it.
 As
 a
 product
 leader
 and
 a


solo
 founder,
 I
 live
 or
 die
 by
 how
 fast


I
 can
 turn
 fuzzy
 ideas
 into
 crisp
 value


propositions,
 road
 maps,
 and
 launch


plans.
 That's
 why
 I
 love
 Miro's


innovation
 workspace.
 It
 drops
 an
 AI


co-pilot
 inside
 the
 canvas
 so
 stickies,


screenshots,
 and
 brainstorm
 bullets
 can


become
 usable
 diagrams,
 product
 briefs,


and
 even
 prototypes
 in
 minutes.
 Your


team
 can
 dive
 in,
 riff,
 and
 iterate.
 And


because
 the
 board
 feels
 like
 a
 digital


playground,
 everyone
 has
 fun
 while
 you


cut
 cycle
 time
 by
 a
 third.
 Miro
 lets


humans
 and
 AI
 play
 to
 their
 strengths
 so


that
 great
 ideas
 ship
 faster
 and


happier.
 Help
 your
 teams
 get
 great
 done


with
 Miro.

So,
 while
 you're
 pulling
 that
 up,
 I
 have


to
 ask,
 did
 you
 try
 Lennybot
 yet?


Because
 I
 I
 know
 he
 has
 his
 own
 bot
 with


all
 of
 these
 newsletters
 and
 some


content
 loaded
 in,
 but
 you
 wanted


something
 really
 precise,
 right?
 So,
 you


created
 your
 own.
 I
 had
 something
 really


spec
 specific
 because
 I
 know
 what
 it
 is


that
 I
 needed.
 Um,
 so
 I
 took
 in
 her


newsletters
 because
 he
 hosted
 her
 on
 on


his
 podcast.
 She
 also
 referenced
 a
 bunch


of
 books.
 I
 looked
 for
 those
 books


online
 and
 put
 them
 in
 here.
 I
 never


read
 them,


but
 I
 just
 put
 them
 in
 here.
 It's
 like,


okay,
 you
 must
 know
 then
 how
 writing
 and


delivering
 is.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 this


here
 this
 this
 instructions
 that
 like


this
 GPT
 rewrites
 Slack
 messages
 to
 be


more
 concise
 to
 be
 more
 clear
 to
 be


readable
 maintains
 the
 natural
 voice
 of


the
 user
 because
 I
 want
 anyone
 in
 my


company
 anyone
 in
 general
 to
 use
 this


GPT
 so
 it
 doesn't
 like
 make
 it
 super
 AI


like
 I
 said
 here
 as
 well
 like
 you
 know


avoid
 too
 much
 dashes
 don't
 give
 so
 much


bullet
 points
 all
 those
 stuff
 like
 that


and
 then
 I
 come
 into
 here
 so
 often
 I'll


write
 a
 message
 out
 on
 Slack
 to
 like


myself
 I'll
 copy
 it
 paste
 it
 in
 and
 it


does
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of
 making
 it


super
 concise,
 sticking
 to
 these


guidelines
 of
 like
 delivering
 to
 the


point,
 having
 really
 good
 followup
 and


leadup
 as
 to
 what
 the
 next
 section
 will


be.
 It
 is
 a
 lifesaver.
 People
 respond
 to


my
 Slack
 messages
 more
 now.


So,
 I
 know
 that
 you
 didn't
 read
 the


books,
 but
 I
 do
 have
 to
 recommend
 as


somebody
 with
 a
 liberal
 arts
 degree,


those
 are
 exceptional
 books
 on
 writing.


So,
 I
 highly
 recommend
 reading
 them.


We'll
 link
 to
 them
 and
 the
 newsletter


and
 Wes's
 website
 in
 the
 show
 notes.
 But


what
 I
 love
 about
 the
 approach
 here
 is
 a


lot
 of
 times
 people
 get
 sort
 of


professional
 development
 feedback
 like


you
 got
 your
 writing's
 great
 it
 just


needs
 to
 be
 shorter
 like
 you
 just
 write


too
 much
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


really
 build
 for
 themselves
 a
 way
 to


coach
 into
 improving
 those
 skills
 right


they're
 like
 thanks
 for
 the
 feedback
 but


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 sit
 with
 my
 boss
 for
 an


hour
 and
 have
 them
 like
 edit
 my
 Slack


messages
 and
 edit
 my
 PRDS
 uh
 maybe
 I'll


read
 a
 book
 or
 maybe
 I
 can
 do
 some


research,
 but
 it's
 it's
 a
 hard
 thing
 to


put
 into
 practice
 into
 your
 day-to-day.


And
 so
 what
 I
 like
 about
 this
 is
 you


took
 some
 coaching
 feedback
 that
 you
 got


and
 you're
 like,
 cool,
 I'm
 going
 to


create
 myself
 a
 coach
 for
 this
 very


specific
 development
 piece
 that
 I
 need


to
 work
 on
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 rely
 on


experts
 that
 I
 think
 are
 great
 and
 then


I'm
 going
 to
 use
 it
 dayto
 day
 to


actually
 make
 things
 better.
 Sure.
 And


then
 what
 I
 liked
 again
 about
 what
 you


said
 is
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 share
 it


with
 with
 my
 colleagues
 because
 I'm
 sure


I'm
 not
 the
 only
 one
 that
 has
 has
 this


problem.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 really
 yeah


really
 nice
 process.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 cool
 that
 you


mentioned
 like
 all
 that
 like
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 know
 send
 this
 and
 have
 like


somebody
 rewrite
 it
 like
 go
 pre
 GBT
 era


and
 my
 dependency
 on
 AI.
 I
 did
 that.
 I


got
 this
 feedback.
 I'm
 all
 for
 feedback.


I
 love
 feedback
 and
 I
 love
 improving


anything
 on
 stuff
 like
 that.
 I
 would


literally
 do
 that.
 I
 would
 write
 out
 a


message
 to
 myself,
 send
 it
 to
 my
 manager


and
 say,
 "Hey,
 tell
 me
 how
 this
 can
 be


improved."
 And
 he
 wouldn't
 respond.
 He


came
 back
 a
 couple
 days
 later.
 By
 then,


like,
 I
 lost
 momentum.
 That's
 what
 I


wanted
 to
 say.
 And
 then
 this
 is
 a
 game


changer
 for
 me.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 definitely


think
 other
 people
 probably
 feel
 it
 as


well.


Well,
 and
 it
 makes
 me
 think
 of
 another


idea
 that
 maybe
 folks
 would
 find
 useful,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 people
 get


performance
 reviews
 on
 maybe
 an
 annual


or
 twice
 annual
 basis.
 Like,
 what
 do
 you


do
 with
 that?
 And
 you
 know,
 maybe
 what


you
 do
 is
 you
 load
 up
 your
 performance


review
 and
 you
 load
 up
 your
 peer


feedback
 into
 a
 GPT
 and
 you
 reference
 it


and
 you
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 just
 made
 this


stock,
 but
 based
 on
 the
 feedback
 that


I've
 gotten
 in
 the
 past,
 is
 there
 any


like
 blind
 spots
 that
 I
 might
 have?"
 I


think
 it's
 a
 really
 great
 method
 for


self-reflection
 and
 self-improvement
 if


you're,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 open
 to


feedback
 like
 it
 seems
 like
 you
 are.


Yeah,
 absolutely.
 The
 the
 it's
 limitless


what
 you
 can
 do.


Okay.
 So
 for
 our
 last
 use
 case,
 you


know,
 you
 seem
 like
 a
 person
 that
 likes


a
 lot
 of
 feedback
 and
 likes
 to
 prep.
 You


actually
 use
 GPT
 voice
 for
 mock


interviews
 and
 we
 are
 going
 to
 push
 the


bounds
 of
 the
 technical
 capabilities
 of


this
 podcast
 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 demo


this.
 So
 while
 we're
 getting
 set
 up,
 can


you
 tell
 us
 a
 little bit
 about
 the


problem
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 solve
 and


what
 why
 you
 kind
 of
 went
 down
 this


path?


Yeah.
 Okay.
 So
 basically
 anyone
 who's


prepping
 for
 interviews
 for
 for
 product


interviews
 knows
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


content
 out
 there.
 Uh
 YouTube
 is
 loaded


with
 mock
 interviews.
 Exponent
 is
 a


fantastic
 channel.
 Um
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 people
 I
 could
 shout
 out,
 but


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 off
 top
 my
 head.
 I


haven't
 been
 interviewed
 for
 in
 for
 a


job
 in
 a
 while.
 But
 basically
 interview


prep,
 what
 I
 would
 do,
 and
 I
 think
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 would
 do
 leading
 up
 to


product
 interviews
 was
 watch
 these


videos
 um
 over
 and
 over
 again.
 I'm


obsessive.
 I
 would
 watch
 the
 same
 three


videos
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 again,


remember
 any
 nuance
 and
 stuff
 like
 that


that
 when
 I
 walked
 into
 an
 interview,
 it


was
 like
 copy
 paste
 of
 what
 I
 just


listened
 to
 and
 I
 would
 feel
 super


awkward
 to
 be
 like,
 let
 me
 practice
 on


something.
 I
 tried
 in
 front
 of
 a
 mirror,


it
 didn't
 work.
 My
 mirror
 is
 not
 talking


back
 to
 me.
 I
 tried
 with
 my
 wife
 and
 I


was
 like,
 hey,
 these
 are
 the
 type
 of


things
 to
 ask
 me.
 She
 didn't
 know
 what
 I


wanted
 from
 her.
 So
 when
 GBT
 voice
 came


out,
 I'm
 like,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this.
 I


will
 be
 that
 lunatic
 in
 my
 living
 room


talking
 to
 AI
 as
 if
 we're
 in
 the
 movie


Her.
 And
 it
 was
 like
 the
 most
 exciting


thing
 ever.
 Like
 I
 forgot
 that
 I'm


talking
 to
 AI.
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 this


like
 this
 interview
 coach
 who's
 with
 me


at
 all
 times,
 who's
 constantly
 like


challenging
 me
 and
 pushing
 me
 and
 like


finding
 the
 right
 things,
 coming
 up


fantastic
 questions,
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "This


is
 what
 I
 needed."
 And
 I
 walked
 into


every
 interview
 after
 that
 super


prepared.
 It
 was
 the
 best
 feeling
 ever.


Literally
 can't
 recommend
 it
 more.


anytime
 anybody
 asks
 me
 like
 how
 to


prepare
 for
 a
 product
 uh
 interview,
 I


said
 just
 open
 GPD
 voice
 and
 just
 go
 for


it.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 because
 you
 have


this
 very
 structured
 setup
 from,
 you


know,
 a
 writing
 GPT
 perspective
 and
 a


product
 GPT
 perspective,
 but
 it
 sounds


like
 you're
 just
 opening
 up
 GPT
 voice


and
 and
 going
 for
 it.
 Are
 there
 any


tricks
 to
 getting
 GPT
 voice
 into
 the


right
 mindset?
 And
 then
 once
 you
 tell


us,
 let's
 try
 it.
 Let's
 try
 it
 live.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 make
 it
 happen.
 I'm


gonna
 make
 you
 feel
 so
 awkward.


Let's
 We
 could
 We
 could
 definitely
 do


it.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 super
 rusty.
 Um


there's
 first
 of
 all,
 there's
 two


different
 approaches.
 Yes,
 I
 am


organized
 and
 structured,
 but
 I
 do
 love


to
 freestyle
 it.
 I
 did
 make
 a
 custom
 GPT


for
 something
 like
 this.
 Um
 I
 can
 show


it
 to
 you
 so
 you
 have
 an
 idea
 of
 what
 it


is.
 But
 basically
 like
 so
 similar
 to
 the


other
 one,
 it
 has
 like
 instructions
 on


like


what
 product
 sense
 questions
 like
 you


need
 to
 look
 out
 for
 and
 what
 product


execution
 questions
 you
 need
 to
 look
 out


for
 and
 like
 for
 instance
 the
 the


interview
 the
 interviewer
 needs
 to


clarify
 the
 company's
 mission
 and
 the


product
 goals
 and
 identify
 specific


target
 users
 and
 pinpoint
 their
 real


pain
 points
 then
 design
 a
 solution
 that


solve
 those
 pain
 points
 and
 then
 they


all
 have
 a
 sequence
 to
 it.
 So
 I
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 it
 understood
 like
 what


exactly
 you
 need
 to
 look
 out
 for
 and


what
 type
 of
 things
 you
 need
 to
 ask.
 And


then
 obviously
 I
 put
 in
 some
 knowledge


base
 to
 it
 too.
 I
 have
 my
 own
 product


manager
 interview
 prep
 document.
 I
 took


Ben
 Harris's
 uh
 posts.
 He's
 fantastic
 on


product
 coaching
 um
 on
 product
 sense
 and


product
 execution.
 And
 now
 it
 has
 this


whole
 background.
 You
 can
 pop
 into
 this


GPT
 and
 have
 a
 conversation
 with
 it.
 Um,


and
 it's
 super
 guided
 on
 what
 a
 product


sense
 interview
 looks
 like,
 what
 a


product
 execution
 interview
 looks
 like.


So,
 that's
 like
 more
 structured.
 You
 can


use
 the
 voice
 mode
 and
 go
 for
 it.
 Um,


freestyling,
 we
 can
 chat
 to
 freestyle.


Let's
 do
 that.
 I'll
 open
 my
 trade
 style.


One
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 add,
 you


can
 also
 plop
 in
 your
 CV
 and
 the
 link
 to


the
 uh
 role
 that
 you're
 applying
 for.


So,
 there's
 more
 context
 as
 to
 who
 you


are
 and
 what
 they're
 looking
 for
 in
 the


role
 itself.
 And
 then
 there's
 more
 of


like
 guidance
 towards
 things
 to
 pick
 on.


But
 you
 can
 freestyle
 it.
 And
 also
 like


if
 you
 have
 like
 in
 backtoback


if
 you
 have
 backto-back
 interviews
 with


like
 GBT
 voice,
 it
 can
 learn
 from
 like


what
 you
 made
 mistakes
 on
 beforehand.


Like
 I
 was
 really
 bad
 at
 user
 segments.


I
 always
 struggle
 with
 it.
 And
 then
 like


I
 would
 be
 like, "Okay,
 now
 let's
 let's


talk
 through
 this
 and
 figure
 it
 out."


And
 then
 the
 next
 two
 interviews
 like,


"Oh,
 you're
 your
 um
 user
 segment


actually
 has
 improved.
 You
 really


figured
 out
 how
 to
 like
 narrow
 down


different
 user
 segments
 that
 are
 super


different."
 So
 anyways,
 uh


great.


Let's
 get
 started.
 Okay,
 let's
 try.
 For


those
 that
 are
 listening,
 not
 watching,


I've
 made
 Amir
 very
 uncomfortable
 by


making
 him
 talk
 to
 AI.


What's
 that?
 Can
 you
 can
 you
 hear
 me?


Like
 everything's
 working
 fine
 on
 my


end.
 How
 can
 I
 help
 you
 today?


So,
 I
 want
 you
 um
 to
 interview
 me
 um
 for


a
 Product
 Sense
 interview.
 I'm


interviewing
 for
 a
 role
 at
 monday.com
 as


an
 AI
 product
 manager.
 Um
 and
 I
 need
 you


to
 give
 me
 a
 Product
 Sense
 question.


It's
 really
 important
 that
 you
 don't


guide
 me
 in
 anything
 that
 you
 are
 super


candid
 that
 you
 let
 me
 take
 the
 reins
 on


where
 I
 take
 this
 interview
 and
 in
 terms


of
 like
 the
 direction
 um
 don't
 lead
 me


to
 anything.
 Don't
 be
 um
 specific
 or


give
 me
 any
 hints.
 Um
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of


it,
 give
 me
 some
 candid
 feedback.
 Let
 me


know
 if
 that
 makes
 sense
 to
 you.


That
 makes
 perfect
 sense.
 I'm
 happy
 to


help
 you
 prep
 for
 your
 interview.
 So,


let's
 dive
 right
 in.
 Uh,
 here's
 a


product
 sense
 question
 for
 you.
 Imagine


you
 are
 tasked
 with
 improving
 the
 user


experience
 for
 one
 of
 monday.com's
 AI


powered
 features.
 How
 would
 you
 go
 about


identifying
 areas
 of
 improvement
 and


what
 steps
 would
 you
 take
 to
 implement


those
 improvements?
 Uh,
 feel
 free
 to


take
 it
 in
 any
 direction
 you
 like.


Claire,
 I'm
 going
 to
 stop
 there.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 do
 the
 interview.


No,
 that's
 great.


You're
 like,
 I
 don't
 want
 people
 to
 see


if
 I'm
 a
 good
 or
 bad
 PM.


Also,
 product
 like
 we
 should
 be
 doing


products
 all
 the
 time,
 but
 no.
 Yeah,
 if


you
 could
 have
 caught
 me
 like
 a
 couple


years
 ago,
 I
 probably
 would
 have
 been


able
 to
 ace
 that
 interview
 right
 now.


No,
 this
 one's
 great.
 I
 mean,
 what
 I


think
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 for
 for
 folks,


so
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 a
 good
 sport
 that


was
 really
 really
 good.
 For
 folks


listening
 at
 home,
 give
 a
 small
 round
 of


applause
 for
 Amir.
 So,
 the
 thing
 that
 I


want
 to
 call
 out
 that
 I
 think
 is
 is


really
 great
 in
 your
 setup
 is
 again,
 you


gave
 it
 a
 job
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 help


me
 prep
 for
 interviews
 and
 then
 we're


all
 so
 frustrated
 with
 how
 nice
 AI
 is.


It's
 so
 nice
 and
 it
 wants
 you
 to
 succeed


and
 will
 sort
 of
 craft
 you
 into


questions
 that
 like
 lead
 you
 to
 the


right
 answer.
 And
 I
 think
 your
 caveats


that
 you
 called
 out
 in
 prepping
 the


voice
 agent
 are
 really
 important,
 right?


Like
 don't
 lead
 me
 to
 anything.
 Be
 super


candid.
 Kind
 of
 be
 objective.
 Give
 me
 a


real
 interview
 and
 then
 finalize
 with


with
 some
 feedback.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 great
 feedback.
 The
 other
 thing


that
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 is
 how
 natural.


It
 doesn't
 feel
 natural
 to
 do
 uh
 GBT


voice
 mode
 on
 a
 podcast
 live
 that
 you


know
 thousands
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to


watch.
 But
 it
 does
 feel
 natural
 to
 speak


and
 practice
 interviewing
 with
 voice.


It's
 not
 the
 same
 to
 sit
 there
 and
 type


out
 an
 answer
 to
 a
 question.
 And
 in


fact,
 like
 your
 written
 communication


skills
 are
 just
 very
 different
 than
 your


verbal
 communication
 skills.
 And
 so
 I


think
 the
 the
 process
 if
 if
 folks
 were


listening
 of
 just
 how
 the
 intonation
 of


the
 voice,
 how
 they
 ask
 the
 questions,


how
 you
 can
 interact
 sort
 of
 live,
 I
 do


think
 simulates
 the
 interview
 process
 a


lot
 better
 than
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 textbased


GBT
 would.


No,
 for
 sure.
 I
 would
 never
 do
 that


textbased.
 Um,
 absolutely.
 It's


supernatural.
 It's
 it's
 oddly
 natural.


So
 100%.


And
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 call
 out
 a
 couple


other,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 adjacent
 use


cases
 that
 people
 can
 be
 inspired
 by.
 My


my
 darling
 husband
 is
 one
 of
 the
 people


that
 can
 prep
 for
 public
 speaking
 by


like
 going
 to
 the
 bathroom
 and
 speaking


in
 the
 in
 the
 mirror.
 And
 I
 can't
 I


can't
 do
 it.
 I
 I
 hate
 I
 hate
 looking
 at


myself
 too
 much,
 which
 is
 odd
 to
 say
 for


for
 a
 podcast
 host.
 But,
 you
 know,
 just


thinking
 about
 maybe
 doing
 kind
 of
 like


speech
 and
 public
 speaking
 prep
 via


voice
 mode,
 like
 where
 did
 I
 do
 well?


Where
 did
 I
 not
 do
 well?
 Um,
 and
 then


I'm
 even
 thinking
 for
 my
 kids,
 we're


doing
 a
 really
 um
 we're
 trying
 to
 do
 a


consistent
 job
 of
 getting
 them
 to
 read


out
 loud
 at
 night
 and
 think
 about
 their


punctuation
 and
 emphasis,
 all
 that.
 And


I'm
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 gosh,
 my
 kids
 should
 do


oral
 dictation
 to
 GPT
 voice
 mode
 and
 get


a
 little
 get
 a
 little
 feedback."


Although
 I
 love
 I
 love
 our
 bedtime
 story


time.
 Do


that,
 you
 know,
 totally.
 The
 world
 of
 AI


with
 kids
 is
 unreal.
 It's
 unreal.
 Uh


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 we
 can
 go
 that
 for


hours
 as
 well.
 The
 stuff
 that
 I
 do
 with


my
 daughter
 is
 so
 much
 fun.
 I
 think
 at


some
 point
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 roundt


parents
 in
 AI
 episode
 where
 we
 get
 like


half
 a
 dozen
 of
 us
 on
 to
 talk
 about
 all


of
 our
 tips
 and
 tricks.
 Okay,
 Amir,
 this


was
 so
 great.
 So
 just
 going
 back
 to
 the


beginning,
 what
 do
 we
 cover?
 Product


GBTs
 using
 quad
 to
 help
 you
 discover
 and


technically
 implement
 ways
 to
 access


customer
 and
 market
 feedback
 data,
 do


data
 analysis,
 and
 then
 as
 you
 say,


create
 these
 GBTs
 as
 a
 secondary
 brain


that
 you
 can
 pingpong
 with,
 that
 you
 can


go
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 and
 have
 a


thought
 partner
 on.
 Um,
 you
 taught
 us


how
 to
 take
 feedback
 well,
 which
 is
 AI


aside,
 a
 really
 good
 trait,
 but
 take


feedback
 and
 then
 put
 that
 feedback
 from


your
 um,
 your
 boss
 or
 your
 peers
 into
 a


custom
 GPT
 that
 then
 can
 coach
 you
 and


improve
 something
 you
 need
 to
 prove
 on.


For
 you,
 it
 was
 using
 um,
 concise


writing
 tactics.
 And
 then
 the
 third


piece,
 again,
 a
 very
 feedback
 oriented


person.
 You
 prepare
 for
 interviews.
 You


want
 to
 do
 a
 great
 job.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


resources
 out
 there
 to
 prepare
 for


interviews.
 Well,
 and
 so
 you
 used
 GPT


voice
 to
 do
 mock
 interviews
 and
 not
 only


do
 mock
 interviews,
 but
 get
 ongoing


feedback
 about
 how
 you're
 improving
 on


product
 sense
 and
 products
 execution


interviews.
 So,
 you
 really
 are
 dependent


or
 at least
 a
 power
 user
 of
 AI.


I
 love
 the
 power
 user.


I
 love
 the
 power
 user.
 I
 think
 there's


there
 was
 um
 in
 like
 my
 company
 they


really
 try
 to
 reinforce
 AI
 to
 everybody


and
 they
 did
 this
 like
 top
 10
 AI
 powered


use
 you
 like
 PMs
 using
 AI
 um
 since


January
 2025
 my
 son
 was
 born
 in
 February


so
 I
 was
 on
 Pat
 for
 two
 months
 so
 I
 was


active
 at
 the
 company
 for
 four
 months
 of


this
 sixmonth
 range
 there's
 90
 PMs
 there


I
 was
 number
 four
 of
 power
 users
 and
 I


had
 a
 twomonth


delay
 on
 people.
 So,
 I'm
 consider
 myself


number
 one
 or
 number
 two.


And
 I
 also
 want
 to
 add
 like
 a
 bonus


thing,
 Claire,
 if
 that's
 all
 right,
 that


your
 episodes
 inspired
 me
 a
 lot
 that
 I


vibe
 coded
 um
 a
 scraper
 that
 can
 do
 what


I
 did
 for
 anyone.
 It's
 in
 the
 works.
 I


wish
 that
 I
 finished
 it
 up
 until
 this


point,
 but
 basically
 like
 the
 concept
 is


what
 I
 wanted,
 find
 any
 discussion


anywhere.
 um
 where
 users
 can
 kind
 of


just
 write
 in
 their
 own
 natural
 language


what
 they
 want
 to
 scrape
 from
 any


platform.
 So
 let's
 say
 for
 instance
 I


have
 like
 I
 want
 every
 discussion
 that


relates
 to
 AI
 withmoney.com
 I
 have
 hard


mentions
 that
 like
 with
 all
 the
 keywords


it'll
 always
 reference
 that
 towards


whatever
 it
 is
 I'm
 searching
 the


platform
 that
 I
 want
 the
 the
 output
 and


then
 I
 want
 to
 search
 for
 it
 and
 give
 me


the
 file.
 So
 it's
 in
 the
 works.
 It's
 not


done
 yet.
 I
 have
 like
 the
 results
 are


okay
 but
 when
 it's
 out
 there
 um
 I'll


share
 it.
 Well,
 if
 it's
 live
 by
 the
 time


we
 uh
 put
 this
 episode
 out,
 we
 will
 link


to
 that
 in
 the
 show
 notes
 or
 we'll
 do
 a


follow-up
 and
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be
 a
 beta


user
 because
 that
 looks
 super
 useful.


All right,
 we're
 going
 to
 wrap
 up
 with


two
 lightning
 round
 questions
 and
 get


you
 back
 to
 spending
 time
 with
 voice


mode.
 My
 first
 question
 is
 for
 PMs
 that


are
 not
 on
 the
 top
 of
 that
 leaderboard,


what
 do
 you
 think
 the
 number
 one
 thing


they're
 missing
 out
 on
 is?
 Honestly,


it's
 the
 ability
 to
 be
 at
 so
 many
 places


simultaneously.
 That's
 really
 what
 it


is.
 I
 can
 be
 asked
 on
 the
 spot
 from


pretty
 much
 anyone
 in
 the
 company
 about


something
 and
 I
 can
 give
 you
 an
 answer


really
 quickly.
 I
 couldn't
 have
 done


that
 preai.


Amazing.
 Uh
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 such
 a
 great


I
 mean
 it's
 you
 know
 as
 a
 as
 a
 leader


it's
 our
 favorite
 trait
 of
 our
 favorite


PMs
 is
 know
 everything
 are
 everywhere
 at


all
 times.
 It's
 really
 tough
 as
 a
 PM
 to


do
 that
 though
 because
 of
 you
 know
 just


physical
 limitations,
 space
 time,
 mental


capacity,
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 And


so,
 you
 know,
 I
 do
 recommend
 these
 these


tools
 because
 they
 just
 give
 you
 a
 lot


of
 horsepower
 in
 terms
 of
 answering


questions,
 getting
 stuff
 done
 right
 away


and
 holding
 all
 that
 context
 without


totally
 totally
 breaking
 your
 brain.


Okay,
 last
 and
 final
 question
 I
 ask


everybody.
 When
 AI
 is
 not
 listening
 and


it's
 giving
 you
 bad
 results
 or
 analyzing


your
 data
 incorrectly,
 what
 is
 your


tactic
 for
 getting
 it
 back
 on
 track?
 Do


you
 bribe
 it
 with
 money?


I
 just
 yell.
 I
 just
 yell.


I'm
 in
 voice
 anyways,
 right?
 Can
 you
 not


hear
 my
 tone?


You
 were
 the
 first
 person
 that's


admitted
 to
 getting
 getting
 angry
 with


AI
 on
 this
 podcast.


So,
 pre
 prevoice
 it
 was
 caps.
 I'll
 be


like,
 "This
 is
 not
 what
 I
 asked
 for."


Um,
 and
 now
 voice,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 get


upset.
 Uh,
 no,
 but
 and
 mostly
 what
 I
 do


is
 I'll
 copy
 the
 response
 and
 I'll
 say,


"This
 isn't
 what
 I
 was
 looking
 for.
 This


is
 an
 example
 what
 I
 was
 looking
 for."


Um,
 that's
 usually
 what
 I
 do.
 Um,
 to


just
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 benchmark


reflection
 on
 it.


Amazing.
 All
 right.
 Well,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 sharing
 your
 workflows
 with
 us.


Where
 can
 we
 find
 you
 and
 how
 can
 we
 be


helpful?


I'm
 like
 not
 too
 active
 on
 social
 media.


I
 like
 pop
 into
 LinkedIn
 from
 time
 to


time,
 so
 that's
 always
 good.
 And


honestly,
 anyone
 who's
 posting
 anything


cool
 on
 what
 they
 do
 with
 AI
 is
 super


super
 helpful.
 The
 list
 of
 things
 that
 I


do
 here,
 majority
 of
 it
 is
 just


inspiration
 from
 what
 I've
 seen
 online.


So,
 keep
 it
 up.


Great.
 Well,
 you
 keep
 it
 up
 as
 well.


Thanks
 for
 being
 here.


Of
 course,
 Claire.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having


me.

 much
