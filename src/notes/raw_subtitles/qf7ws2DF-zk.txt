- Democracy might be
mathematically impossible.
(serious music)
This isn't a value judgment,
a comment about human nature,
nor a statement about how rare
and unstable democratic
societies have been
in the history of civilization.
Our current attempt at democracy,
the methods we're using
to elect our leaders,
are fundamentally irrational.
And this is a well-established
mathematical fact.
This is a video about the math
that proved that fact
and led to a Nobel Prize.
It's a video about how groups
of people make decisions
and the pitfalls that our
voting systems fall into.
(subdued music)
One of the simplest
ways to hold an election
is to ask the voters to mark one candidate
as their favorite on a ballot.
And when the votes are counted,
the candidate with the most
votes wins the election.
This is known as "first
past the post" voting.
The name is kind of a misnomer though.
There is no post
that any of the candidates
need to get past.
The winner is just the
candidate with the most votes.
This method likely goes back to antiquity.
It has been used to elect members
of the House of Commons in
England since the 14th century,
and it's still a common voting system
with 44 countries in the world using it
to elect its leaders.
30 of these countries were
former British colonies.
The US, being a former British colony,
still uses first past the
post in most of its states
to elect their representatives
to the electoral college.
But first past the post has problems.
If you are selecting
representatives in a parliament,
you can, and frequently do,
get situations where the
majority of the country
did not vote for the party
that ends up holding the power.
In the last a hundred years,
there were 21 times a single party held
a majority of the seats
in the British Parliament,
but only two of those times
did the majority of the voters
actually vote for that party.
So a party, which only a
minority of the people voted for,
ends up holding all of
the power in government.
Another thing that happens
because of first past the post
is that similar parties
end up stealing votes
from each other.
- The 2000 US presidential election,
which was an election essentially
between Al Gore and George W. Bush.
At that point, every state in the nation
used first past the post
to determine the outcome of the election.
Bush had more votes in Florida,
but by a ridiculously slim margin.
It was fewer than 600 votes.
But there was another candidate
on the ballot, Ralph Nader.
Nader was a Green candidate.
He was certainly to the
left of either Gore or Bush.
- And what we need is the upsurge
of citizen concern, people concern,
poor, rich, or middle class,
to counteract the power
of the special interests.
- And he got almost a hundred
thousand votes in Florida.
- I just don't know if I
can, with a conscience,
vote for Bush or Gore.
- I will vote for Ralph Nader.
- Most of those voters were devastated
that by voting for Nader rather than Gore,
they ended up electing Bush.
This is what is called a spoiler effect.
Almost all Nader voters
preferred Gore to Bush,
but in a first past the post system,
they had no way of
expressing that preference
because you could only
vote for one candidate.
(inquisitive music)
- So first past the
post incentivizes voters
to vote strategically.
Say there are five parties,
one of them will be the smallest
one, and so they won't win.
Why would you vote for them?
This is also true if you have
four parties or three parties.
This winner-takes-all voting system leads
to a concentration of
power in larger parties,
eventually, leading to a two-party system.
This effect is common enough
that it has a name: Duverger's Law.
So first past the post
isn't a great option.
So what else could we do?
(subdued music)
Well, we can say that a candidate
can only win an election
if they get a majority, at
least 50% plus one of the vote.
But what if we hold an election
and no one gets a majority?
We could go to the people
who voted for the candidate
with the fewest votes and
ask them to vote again,
but choose a different candidate
and we could repeat this
process over and over
eliminating the smallest candidate
until one candidate reaches a majority.
But holding many elections is a big hassle
so instead we could just ask voters
to rank their preferences
from their favorite to
their least favorite.
And if their favorite
candidate gets eliminated,
we go to their second preferences.
When the polls close, you count
the voters' first choices.
If any candidate has a
majority of the votes,
then they're the winner.
But if no candidate has a majority,
the candidate with the
fewest votes gets eliminated
and their ballots are distributed
to those voters' second preferences,
and this keeps happening
until one candidate has
a majority of the votes.
This is mathematically identical
to holding repeated elections,
it just saves the time and hassle
so it's referred to as instant runoff,
but the system is also known
as preferential voting
or ranked-choice voting.
An instant runoff doesn't
just affect the voters,
it affects how the candidates
behave towards each other.
- It was the Minneapolis
mayor's race, 2013,
they were using ranked-choice voting.
The incumbent mayor had stepped down
and there were all of these people
came out from the woodwork
wanting to be mayor.
There're 35 candidates.
And so you would think
if there's 35 candidates
you'd want to dunk on someone,
you'd wanna like kind of elbow
yourself into the spotlight.
That's not what happened.
These 35 candidates,
all of them were really
nice to each other.
They were all super cordial, super polite,
to the degree that at the end
of the final mayoral debate,
they all came together and
they sang "Kumbaya" together.
♪ Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya ♪
♪ Oh, Lord, kumbaya ♪
- The amount of vitriol and anger
and partisan, you know,
mudslinging that we're all used to,
to see this vision of an actual "Kumbaya."
It's not even a joke.
All of these people getting along
so desperate for second and third choices
from other people that they're like,
"I'm gonna be the picture-perfect,
kindest candidate possible."
- But there's also a
problem with instant runoff.
There can be cases where
a candidate doing worse
can actually help get them elected.
Let's say we have three candidates:
Einstein, Curie, and Bohr.
Now, Einstein and Bohr
have very conflicting views
while Curie is
ideologically in the center.
So let's say Einstein
gets 25% of the vote,
Curie gets 30, and Bohr gets 45.
No one got a majority.
So it goes to the second round
with Einstein being eliminated
and because people who voted for Einstein
put down Curie as their second choice,
well, Curie ultimately gets elected.
But now imagine that Bohr has
a terrible campaign speech
or proposes a very unpopular policy
so bad that some of his voters
actually switch over to Einstein's side.
Well now it's Curie that gets eliminated
and because she's more moderate,
half of her voters select Einstein
and the other half select
Bohr in the second round,
and this leads to Bohr winning.
So Bohr doing worse in the first round
actually leads to him
winning the election.
Clearly, this isn't something
that we want in a voting system.
(serious music)
This is what
the French mathematician
Condorcet also thought.
Condorcet was one of the
first people applying logic
and mathematics to rigorously
study voting systems
making him one of the founders
of a branch of mathematics
known as social choice theory.
He was working during the
time of the French Revolution,
so fairly determining
the will of the people
was having a cultural moment right then.
In 1784, Condorcet's contemporary
at the French Royal Society of Science,
Jean-Charles de Borda,
proposed a voting method.
You ask the voters to rank the candidates.
If there are five candidates,
ranking someone first gives
that candidate four points,
ranking them second would
give them three, and so on,
with zero points being
awarded for last place.
But the Borda count has a problem
because the number of points
given to each candidate
is dependent on the total
number of candidates.
Adding extra people that
have no chance of winning
can affect the winner.
Because of this, Condorcet
hated Borda's idea.
He wrote that it was
"bound to lead to error
because it relies on irrelevant
factors for its judgments."
So in 1785, Condorcet published an essay
in which he proposed a new voting system,
one he thought was the most fair.
(soft music)
Basically the winner needs
to beat every other candidate
in a head-to-head election.
But with more than two candidates,
do you need to hold a large number
of head-to-head elections
to pick the winner?
Well, no.
Just ask the voters to
rank their preferences
just like in instant runoff
and then count how many voters
rank each candidate higher
than each other candidate.
This feels like the
most fair voting method.
This voting system was actually discovered
450 years earlier by Ramon Llull,
a monk who was looking at how
church leaders were chosen,
but Llull's ideas didn't make an impact
because his book, "Ars
eleccionis," the art of elections,
was lost and only rediscovered in 2001.
So the voting system is named
after Condorcet and not Llull.
(gentle music)
But will there always
be a winner in this way?
Let's try Condorcet's
method for choosing dinner
between you and two friends.
There are three options:
burgers, pizza or sushi.
You really like burgers, so
that's your first preference,
your second choice is pizza,
and you put sushi last.
Your friend prefers pizza,
then sushi, then burgers,
and your other friend prefers sushi,
then burgers, then pizza.
Now if you choose
burgers, it can be argued
that sushi should have won instead
since two of you prefer sushi over burgers
and only one prefers burgers to sushi.
However, by the same argument,
pizza is preferred to sushi
and burgers are preferred to pizza
by a margin of two-to-one
on each occasion.
So it seems like you and your
friends are stuck in a loop.
Burgers are preferred to pizza,
which is preferred to sushi,
which is preferred to burgers and so on.
This situation is known
as Condorcet's paradox.
Condorcet died before he could resolve
this problem with his voting system.
He was politically active
during the French Revolution
writing a draft of France's constitution.
In 1793 during the Reign of Terror
when La Montagne came to power,
he was deemed a traitor
for criticizing the regime,
specifically their new constitution.
In the next year, he was
arrested and died in jail.
(gentle music)
Over the next 150 years,
dozens of mathematicians
were proposing their own voting systems
or modifications to
Condorcet's or Borda's ideas.
One of those mathematicians
was Charles Dodgson,
better known as Lewis Carroll.
When he wasn't writing
"Alice in Wonderland,"
he was trying to find a
system to hold fair elections.
But every voting system had
similar kinds of problems,
You'd either get Condorcet loops
or other candidates that
had no chance of winning
would affect the outcome of the election.
(lively jazz music)
In 1951, Kenneth Arrow
published his PhD thesis
and in it he outlined five very obvious
and reasonable conditions
that a rational voting system should have.
Condition number one:
if everyone in the group
chooses one option over another,
the outcome should reflect that.
If every individual in the group
prefers to eat sushi over pizza,
then the group as a whole
should prefer sushi over pizza.
This is known as unanimity.
Condition two: no single person's vote
should override the
preferences of everyone else.
If everyone votes for pizza
except one person who votes for sushi,
the group should obviously choose pizza.
If a single vote is decisive,
that's not a democracy,
that's a dictatorship.
Condition three: everyone should be able
to vote however they want
and the voting system must
produce a conclusion for society
based on all the ballots, every time.
It can't avoid problematic ballots
or candidates by simply ignoring them
or just guessing randomly,
it must reach the same answer
for the same set of ballots every time.
This is called unrestricted domain.
Condition four: the voting
system should be transitive.
If a group prefers burgers over pizza
and pizza over sushi,
then they should also
prefer burgers over sushi.
This is known as transitivity.
Condition five: if the
preference of the group
is sushi over pizza,
the introduction of another
option, like burgers,
should not change that preference.
Sure, the group might collectively
rank burgers above both
or in the middle or at the bottom,
but the ranking of sushi over pizza
should not be affected by the new option.
This is called the independence
of irrelevant alternatives.
But here's the thing, Arrow
proved that satisfying all five
of these conditions in
a ranked voting system
with three or more
candidates is impossible.
This is Arrow's Impossibility Theorem,
and it was so groundbreaking
that Arrow was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 1972.
So I wanna go through
a version of his proof
based on a formulation by Geanakoplos.
So let's say there are
three candidates running for election:
Aristotle, Bohr, and Curie,
but we'll refer to them as A, B, and C,
and we have a collection of voters
that we'll line up in order.
So we have voter 1, 2, 3, and
so on all the way up to N.
Each of these voters
is free to rank A, B
and C however they like.
I'll even allow ties.
And the first we wanna show
is that if everyone ranks
a particular candidate first or last,
then society as a whole
must also rank that
candidate first or last.
Let's arbitrarily pick candidate B.
If say half of the voters rank B first
and half rank B last, then the claim is
our voting system must
put B either first or last
and we'll prove it by contradiction.
So say this is how everyone voted.
If our system does not
put B first or last,
but rather in the middle,
say A is ranked above B,
which is above C, then
we'll get a contradiction.
Because if each of our
voters moved C above A,
then by unanimity, C
must be ranked above A.
However, because we
didn't change the position
of any A relative to B,
A must still be ranked above B
and because we didn't change the position
of any C relative to B, C
must still be ranked below B,
and by transitivity,
if A is preferred to B
and B is preferred to C,
then A must be ranked above C.
But this contradicts
the result by unanimity
and that proves that if everyone ranks
a candidate first or last,
then society must also
rank them first or last.
Now let's do a thought experiment
where every voter puts B at
the bottom of their ranking,
we'll leave the ranking
of A and C arbitrary.
Well then, by unanimity,
we know that B must be at the
bottom of society's ranking
and we'll call this setup Profile 0.
Now we'll create Profile 1
which is identical to Profile 0
except the first voter moves
B from the bottom to the top.
This, of course, doesn't
affect the outcome,
but we can keep doing this
creating Profiles 2, 3, 4, and so on
with one more voter flipping B
from the bottom to the top each time.
If we keep doing this, there
will eventually come a voter
whose change from having B
at the bottom to B at the top
will first flip society's
ranking, moving B to the top.
Let's call this voter the pivotal voter
and we'll label the Profile p.
Profile o is then the profile
right before the pivotal change happens.
Let's now create a Profile
q, which is the same as p,
except the pivotal voter moves A above B.
By independence of
irrelevant alternatives,
the social rank must also put A above B.
Since for all of our voters,
the relative position of A and B
is the same as it was in Profile o,
and B must be ranked above C
because the relative positions
of B and C are the same
as they were in Profile p,
where our pivotal voter
moved B to the top.
By transitivity A must be ranked above C
in the social ranking.
This is true regardless
of how any of the
non-pivotal voters rearrange
their positions of A and C,
because these rearrangements don't change
the position of A relative
to B or C relative to B.
This means the pivotal
voter is actually a dictator
for determining society's
preference of A over C.
The social rank will always
agree with the pivotal voter
regardless of what the other voters do.
We can run a similar thought experiment
where we put C at the bottom
and prove that there is again, a dictator,
who in this case determines
the social preference of A over B.
And it turns out this
voter is the same one
who determines the social
preference for A over C.
The pivotal voter is
therefore a complete dictator.
(dark music)
So is democracy doomed?
Well, Arrow's impossibility
theorem seems to say so.
If there are three or more
candidates to choose from,
there is no ranked-choice method
to rationally aggregate voter preferences.
You always need to give something up.
(hopeful music)
But the mathematician, Duncan Black,
found a much more optimistic theorem
which might actually
represent reality better.
If voters and candidates
are naturally spread
along a single dimension,
say ranging from liberal on the left
to conservative on the right,
but this could apply to any
other political dimension.
Well, then Black showed
that the preference
of the median voter will
reflect the majority decision.
The median voter's choice
will often determine the
outcome of the election,
a result that aligns with
the majority of voters,
avoiding the paradoxes
and inconsistencies highlighted by Arrow.
And there's more good news.
Arrow's Impossibility Theorem only applies
to ordinal voting systems,
ones in which the voters
rank candidates over others.
There is another way:
rated voting systems.
The simplest version is
known as approval voting
where instead of ranking the candidates,
the voters just tick the
candidates they approve of.
There are also versions
where you could indicate
how strongly you like each candidate,
say from -10, strongly disapprove of,
to +10, strongly approve.
Research has found
that approval voting
increases voter turnout,
decreases negative campaigning
and prevents the spoiler effect.
Voters could express their
approval for a candidate
without worrying about the size
of the party they're voting for.
It's also simple to tally,
just count up what
percentage of the voters
approve of each candidate
and the one with the
highest approval wins.
Kenneth Arrow was initially skeptical
of rated-voting systems,
but toward the end of his life,
he agreed that they were
likely the best method.
Approval voting is not new.
It was used by priests in the Vatican
to elect the Pope between 1294 and 1621.
It's also used to elect
the Secretary General
of the United Nations,
but it hasn't been widely
used in large-scale elections.
And so more real-world
testing is likely required.
(mellow music)
So is democracy mathematically impossible?
Well, yes, if we use ranked
choice methods of voting,
which is what most
countries in the world use
to elect their leaders.
And some methods are clearly better
at aggregating the people's
preferences than others,
the use of first past the post voting
feels quite frankly ridiculous to me,
given all of its flaws.
But just because things aren't perfect
doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
Being interested in the world around us,
caring about issues,
and being politically
engaged is important.
It might be one of the few ways
we can make a real
difference in the world.
Like Winston Churchill said,
"Democracy is the worst form of government
except for all the other
forms that have been tried."
Democracy is not perfect, but
it's the best thing we've got.
The game might be crooked, but
it's the only game in town.
(static buzzes and whines)

How it works today is no guarantee
of how it'll work tomorrow

to how we do our jobs.
