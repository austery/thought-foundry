News now, I'm Nathan Hager.

Can we begin with the winner of this
year's Nobel Peace Prize?
Following an active campaign from
President Trump to claim the award,
Bloomberg's John Tucker joins us with
the latest John.
Good morning, Nathan.
This year's winner is Marina Carina
machado of Venezuela.
She is known as Venezuela's Iron Lady
and has been in hiding for more than a
year.
After refusing to bow out after Nicolas
Maduro declared victory in an election
that's been widely criticized as rigged.
The Oslo based Norwegian Nobel Committee
honors her for, quote, her tireless work
promoting democratic rights for the
people of Venezuela.
Well, this year's prize has been marked
by a campaign by President Trump to
secure the award.
Trump has made public declarations.
He deserves it and has even lobbied
Norwegian officials with phone calls.
Now Norway is on edge.
Observers are worried about the
diplomatic and possible economic
fallout.
Norway currently is in negotiations with
the U.S.
for a trade deal, hoping for a reduction
of a 15% tariffs, with a trade minister
meeting officials in Washington this
week.
Another worry is Norway's $2 trillion
sovereign wealth fund that is the
world's largest in about 40% of its
investments are in the U.S..
There's been some concern that Mr.
Trump might target that fund.
A Norway's foreign minister has pointed
out the government does not interfere in
Nobel decisions.
The five member Nobel committee is
actually independent.
I'm John Tucker Bloomberg Radio.
All right, John, thank you.
Now we go to the latest developments in
the Middle East.
Israel's government has approved a cease
fire deal with Hamas that will include
releasing thousands of Palestinian
prisoners in exchange for any remaining
hostages in Gaza.
Stewart Livingstone Walsh heads
Bloomberg's Middle East coverage.
It all seems to be going reasonably
smoothly.
Went to the Israeli cabinet last night,
was approved.
So we're now in a sort of a 24 hour
initial phase where the IDF, that is the
Israeli army, will start withdrawing
from his current positions to sort of a
pre-agreed line.
They will still be inside Gaza, but it's
going to be over a significantly smaller
amount of territory.
So basically, we're looking at the next
four days is going to unfold.
And again, this is very much a phase
one.
And then in terms of the next hurdles, I
mean, I think there's a long way to go.
And, you know, we should be under no
illusion about how difficult some of
those questions are, notably on the
question of the, you know, the complete
disarmament of Hamas, the future
governance of the Gaza Strip, and
perhaps most importantly, the
reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.
And Bloomberg's Stuart Livingstone Walla
says President Trump says he'll travel
to Israel to be on hand for the release
of hostages.
Now, Karen, to the latest on the federal
government shutdown on day ten of the
stalemate in Washington, both sides
continue to blame each other for the
impasse.
And President Trump is doubling down on
threats to take advantage of it.
Will be cutting some very popular
Democratic programs that aren't popular
with Republicans, frankly, because
that's the way it works.
They wanted to do this.
So we'll get a little taste of their
own.
And President Trump spoke at a cabinet
meeting at the White House, heard live
on Bloomberg Radio.
Republicans may be feeling political
heat as well.
House Speaker Mike Johnson took
questions about the shutdown on C-SPAN.
One caller on the Republican side said
her husband serves at Fort Belvoir,
Virginia, and their medically sensitive
children might have to go without
medication if the military misses
paychecks.
You could stop this and you could be the
one that could say military is getting
paid.
And I think that it is awful.
And the audacity of someone who makes
six figures a year to do this to
military families is insane.
Speaker Johnson responded to that caller
saying the Democrats are the ones
keeping her from getting a check.
Well, Nathan, the Trump White House has
decided there is a group of federal
staffers that they can't do without.
During the shutdown, the people who put
together the economic data, the White
House Office of Management and Budget
has directed the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to recall staff.
They need them to assemble the September
Consumer Price Index, and that's the
report that determines the size of next
year's Social Security checks.
President Trump fire the BLS
commissioner in August after the release
of a weaker than expected jobs report
and the Justice Department still working
through the shutdown as well.
Karen, it's bringing charges against
another one of President Trump's
perceived political enemies.
New York Attorney General Letitia James
has been indicted on counts of bank
fraud and making false statements to a
financial institution.
The grand jury indictment stems from a
property James purchased in Norfolk,
Virginia, in 2020.
It is the second indictment brought by
US attorney Lindsey Halligan, who was
recently appointed by President Trump
and also secured charges against former
FBI Director James Comey.
Attorney General James says she will
fight these charges.
This is nothing more than a continuation
of the president's desperate
weaponization of our justice system.
He is forcing federal law enforcement
agencies to do his bidding.
All because I did my job as the New York
state attorney general.
Attorney General James posted that
statement on X.
She campaigned on a promise to
investigate President Trump and won a
civil case against him and his company
in 2022.
James's first appearance in federal
court in Virginia is set for October
24th, and that's news A when you wanted
with Bloomberg News.
Now.
