This
 is
 the
 Bloomberg
 Dayb
 podcast.
 Good


morning.
 It's
 Friday
 the
 10th
 of


October.
 I'm
 Caroline
 Hepka
 in
 London.


And
 I'm
 Steven
 Carol
 in
 Brussels.
 Coming


up
 today,
 Israel's
 government
 approves
 a


ceasefire
 plan
 with
 Hamas
 that
 will


release
 Palestinian
 prisoners
 and


Israeli
 hostages
 held
 in
 Gaza,
 bringing


a
 landmark
 peace
 agreement
 closer
 to


reality.


France
 prepares
 for
 its
 sixth
 prime


minister
 in
 two
 years
 as
 political


factions
 jockey
 for
 position
 in
 a


fractious
 landscape.


Plus,
 the
 return
 of
 the
 bean
 counters,


staff
 at
 the
 US
 Bureau
 of
 Labor


Statistics
 are
 recalled
 despite
 the


government
 shutdown
 to
 prepare


September's
 inflation
 report.


Let's
 start
 with
 a
 roundup
 of
 our
 top


stories.
 Israel's
 ministers
 have
 signed


off
 on
 the
 first
 stage
 of
 the
 US


ceasefire
 plan,
 setting
 up
 a
 release
 of


Hamas's
 hostages
 within
 48
 hours.
 The


plan
 will
 see
 aid
 into
 Gaza
 ramped
 up


and
 Israel's
 troops
 begin
 to
 withdraw


from
 the
 strip.
 Crowds
 gathered
 into
 to


celebrate
 in
 Tel
 Aviv
 and
 across
 Gaza


with
 Israel's
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 saying
 the
 breakthrough
 was


down
 to
 US
 involvement.
 We
 are
 at
 a


tremendous
 development
 uh
 in
 the
 last


two
 years.
 We
 fought
 during
 these
 two


years
 to
 uh
 achieve
 our
 war
 aims
 and


central
 one
 of
 these
 wars
 is
 to
 return


the
 hostages
 all
 of
 the
 hostages,
 the


living
 and
 the
 dead,
 and
 we're
 about
 to


achieve
 that.


Despite
 both
 Netanyahu's
 cabinet
 and


Tamasa's
 chief
 negotiator
 having
 agreed


to
 the
 deal,
 challenges
 remain.
 The
 war


has
 reduced
 Gaza
 to
 rubble,
 left
 tens
 of


thousands
 dead,
 and
 destabilized
 the


Middle
 East.
 Officials
 have
 privately


told
 Bloomberg
 the
 long-term
 parts
 of


the
 peace
 deal
 will
 be
 far
 harder
 to


achieve
 with
 major
 hurdles
 in
 rebuilding


Gaza
 and
 preventing
 further
 violence.


Now,
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 hailed
 his
 own


role
 in
 bringing
 about
 what
 he
 called


peace
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 As
 the
 US


president
 continues
 to
 lobby
 for
 a
 Nobel


Peace
 Prize,
 Trump
 says
 that
 he
 will


travel
 to
 Israel
 for
 the
 release
 of
 the


hostages
 in
 the
 coming
 days.
 The
 US
 is


also
 sending
 200
 troops
 to
 the
 region
 to


monitor
 the
 deal.
 Trump
 has
 been
 arguing


that
 his
 achievements
 deserve
 a
 Nobel


Peace
 Prize.


Well,
 I
 don't know.
 Look,
 I
 made
 uh


seven
 deals
 and
 now
 it's
 eight.
 Uh


solved
 the
 wars.
 One
 going
 31
 years,
 one


going
 34
 years,
 one
 going
 35
 years,
 one


going
 10
 years.
 Uh
 I
 made
 seven
 deals.


Uh
 this
 would
 be
 number
 eight.


But
 President
 Trump
 is
 unlikely
 to
 win


the
 annual
 award,
 which
 is
 announced


today.
 Members
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Nobel


Committee
 have
 hinted
 the
 White
 House's


campaign
 has
 been
 futile.
 Some
 observers


have
 worried
 there
 may
 be
 a
 diplomatic


and
 economic
 fallout
 for
 Norway
 should


the
 independent
 fivemember
 Nobel


committee
 not
 choose
 him.


France
 President
 Emanuel
 Macron
 is


expected
 to
 pick
 a
 new
 prime
 minister
 by


this
 evening
 following
 the
 resignation


of
 Sebastian
 Lornu
 on
 Monday.
 In
 the


meantime,
 the
 country's
 business
 leaders


have
 been
 jockeying
 for
 influence
 with


key
 political
 players
 who
 are
 likely
 to


wield
 power
 in
 the
 coming
 months.


Bloomberg's
 team
 Adabio
 has
 more.


France's
 business
 elite
 are
 courting


socialist
 leader
 Julio
 Fur
 who
 has
 been


tipped
 as
 a
 potential
 prime
 minister.


Bloomberg
 understands
 that
 the


politician
 dined
 with
 the
 country's
 most


powerful
 business
 lobby
 on
 Wednesday


ahead
 of
 Macron's
 nomination


announcement
 expected
 today.
 During
 the


gathering,
 he
 reportedly
 told
 industry


leaders
 that
 another
 snap
 election
 would


destabilize
 the
 economy
 more
 than
 any


policy
 measures
 backed
 by
 the


socialists,
 including
 pausing
 Meccon's


controversial
 pension
 reform.
 Although


false
 chances
 of
 becoming
 premier
 are


slim,
 his
 party
 became
 kingmakers
 after


last
 year's
 surprise
 elections.
 His


group
 are
 now
 essential
 to
 form
 a


government
 that
 doesn't
 include
 the
 far


right.
 In
 London,
 Tiwa
 Adabio
 Bloomberg


radio.
 The
 US
 Treasury
 is
 purchasing
 the


Argentine
 peso
 to
 shore
 up
 its
 value


after
 weeks
 of
 sharp
 declines.
 Treasury


Secretary
 Scott
 Bessen
 said
 in
 a
 social


media
 post
 that
 Washington
 has
 finalized


a
 20
 billion
 currency
 swap
 line
 with


Argentina's
 central
 bank.
 This
 is
 Eugene


Ludwig,
 a
 former
 supervisor
 of
 national


banks
 operating
 in
 the
 US
 commenting
 on


the
 rare
 intervention
 in
 currency


markets.


Well,
 you
 know,
 it's
 an
 important


country.
 It's
 it's
 much
 uh
 larger
 and


and
 richer
 than
 most
 people
 understand.


So
 making
 sure
 that
 this
 stays
 stable
 uh


as
 well
 as
 the
 currency
 markets


generally
 is
 a
 is
 a
 sensible
 move
 but
 as


I
 say
 this
 is
 a
 very
 hard
 area.


Eugene
 Ludwick
 former
 controller
 of
 the


currency
 speaking
 to
 Bloomberg
 TV
 there


the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 launching
 a


financial
 rescue
 for
 a
 political
 ally


Argentinian
 President
 Javier
 Malay
 ahead


of
 upcoming
 midterm
 elections
 on
 the


26th
 of
 October.
 Malay
 welcomed
 the
 move


and
 thanked
 Bessant
 in
 a
 post
 on
 X
 as


Argentina's
 markets
 rallied
 on
 the


announcement.


Bloomberg
 has
 learned
 that
 the
 US
 Bureau


of
 Labor
 Statistics
 is
 bringing
 back


staff
 to
 finish
 September's
 inflation


report.
 The
 data,
 which
 was
 originally


due
 next
 week,
 is
 used
 to
 determine
 the


cost
 of
 living
 adjustment
 for
 Social


Security
 recipients.
 The
 White
 House


budget
 office
 has
 ordered
 the
 agency
 to


recall
 employees
 to
 complete
 the


consumer
 price
 index
 in
 time
 for
 release


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.
 The
 BLS
 had


previously
 suspended
 all
 operations


during
 the
 government
 shutdown.
 The
 last


time
 a
 shutdown
 delayed
 the
 CPI
 release


was
 in
 2013
 when
 the
 report
 was
 pushed


back
 by
 two
 weeks.
 New
 York's
 Attorney


General,
 Leticia
 James,
 has
 been


indicted
 by
 a
 federal
 grand
 jury
 in


Virginia,
 the
 second
 of
 President


Trump's
 perceived
 political
 enemies
 to


be
 criminally
 charged
 in
 two
 weeks.


James
 was
 charged
 with
 one
 count
 of


alleged
 bank
 fraud
 and
 one
 count
 of


making
 false
 statements
 to
 financial


institutions
 in
 relation
 to
 a
 mortgage


application.
 She
 says
 the
 charges
 are


baseless
 and
 that
 the
 president's
 goal


is
 quote
 political
 retribution
 at
 any


cost.
 Speaking
 to
 Bubber's
 Falsi
 Laqua,


Ray
 Dalio,
 the
 founder
 of
 Bridgewater


Associates,
 has
 warned
 of,
 in
 his
 words,


civil
 war
 brewing
 in
 the
 US.


We're
 in
 wars.
 Okay?
 There
 is
 a


financial
 money
 war.
 There's
 a


technology
 war,
 there's
 geopolitical


wars,
 and
 there
 are
 more
 military
 wars.


And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 civil
 war
 of
 some
 sort


which
 is
 developing
 in
 the
 United
 States


and
 elsewhere
 where
 there
 are


irreconcilable
 differences.


That
 was
 Ray
 Dalio
 speaking
 on
 leaders


with
 Frasi
 Lacqua


and
 the
 UK's
 Prime
 Minister
 Kristmer
 has


held
 deeper
 trade
 ties
 with
 India
 on
 the


final
 day
 of
 his
 visit
 to
 the
 country.


Narendra
 Modi,
 the
 Indian
 Prime
 Minister


said
 his
 country
 and
 the
 UK
 had
 quote


shown
 the
 world
 the
 way
 on
 global
 trade


as
 he
 raised
 over
 5,000
 posters
 in


Mumbai
 celebrating
 the
 deal
 they
 signed


in
 July.
 Starmer
 tented
 1.7
 billion
 of


investments
 by
 Indian
 companies
 in


sectors
 such
 as
 education,
 defense,
 and


technology,
 which
 he
 said
 would
 create


almost
 7,000
 jobs
 in
 the
 UK.
 He


reaffirmed
 Britain's
 support
 for
 India


to
 join
 it
 with
 a
 permanent
 seat
 on
 the


UN
 Security
 Council
 as
 he
 appeared


willing
 to
 overlook
 points
 of


disagreement
 such
 as
 India's
 purchases


of
 Russian
 oil.


Those
 are
 our
 top
 stories
 for
 you
 this


morning.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 market,
 so


largely
 a
 sell-off
 in
 Asia,
 MCI
 Asia


Pacific
 Index
 is
 down
 by
 almost
 8/10en


of
 1%
 after
 what
 has
 been
 a
 blistering


rally
 in
 global
 stocks.
 In
 terms
 of


stock
 futures,
 US
 stocks
 50
 futures
 this


morning
 are
 currently
 down
 a
 tenth
 of


1%.
 Uh
 the
 dollar
 is
 also
 lower
 210.
 The


euro
 trading
 at
 11575.


Looking
 at
 10-year
 Treasury
 yields
 right


now.
 Those
 are
 down
 a
 basis
 point
 at


412.
 Those
 are
 the
 markets.


In
 a
 moment,
 we'll
 bring
 you
 more
 on


what
 to
 expect
 in
 France
 as
 we're


looking
 ahead
 to
 the
 announcement
 of
 the


next
 prime
 minister
 later
 today.
 But


first,
 we
 want
 to
 bring
 you
 to
 the


Middle
 East.
 Israel's
 government


approving
 that
 ceasefire
 deal
 with
 Hamas


that
 will
 include
 releasing
 thousands
 of


Palestinian
 prisoners
 in
 exchange
 for


any
 remaining
 hostages
 in
 Gaza.
 Our
 head


of
 Middle
 Eastern
 North
 Africa
 coverage,


Stuart
 Livingston
 Wallace,
 joins
 us
 now


for
 more.
 Stuart,
 thanks
 for
 being
 with


us.
 Where
 are
 we
 now
 in
 implementing


this
 ceasefire
 deal
 and
 and
 what
 are
 the


next
 hurdles
 that
 need
 to
 be
 overcome?


Good
 morning.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it
 all
 seems


to
 be
 going
 reasonably
 smoothly.
 It
 went


to
 the
 Israeli
 cabinet
 uh
 last
 night,


was
 approved.
 So,
 we're
 now
 in
 a
 sort
 of


a
 24-hour
 initial
 phase
 where
 the
 IDF,


that
 is
 the
 Israeli
 army,
 will
 start


withdrawing
 from
 its
 current
 positions


to
 sort
 of
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 pre-agreed


line.
 They
 will
 still
 be
 inside
 Gaza,


but
 it's
 going to
 be
 over
 a


significantly
 smaller
 amount
 of


territory.
 Uh,
 at
 that
 stage,
 there's


you
 then
 have
 a
 72-hour
 period
 where
 the


hostages,
 both
 those
 still
 alive
 and


those
 dead,
 uh,
 are
 hopefully
 going
 to


be
 brought
 out
 of
 Gaza
 and
 back
 into


Israel.
 and
 as
 you
 said
 simultaneously
 a


release
 of
 Palestinian
 prisoners
 um
 into


well
 presumably
 into
 Gaza.
 So
 basically


we're
 looking
 at
 the
 next
 four
 days
 it's


it's
 it's
 going
 to
 unfold
 and
 again
 this


is
 very
 much
 phase
 one.
 Uh
 and
 then
 in


terms
 of
 the
 next
 hurdles
 I
 mean
 I
 think


there's
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go.
 uh
 and
 you


know
 we
 should
 be
 under
 no
 illusion


about
 how
 difficult
 some
 of
 those


questions
 are
 notably
 on
 the
 question
 of


the
 you
 know
 the
 complete
 disarmment
 of


Hamas
 uh
 the
 future
 governance
 of
 the


Gaza
 Strip
 and
 perhaps
 most
 importantly


the
 reconstruction
 of
 the
 Gaza
 Strip.


What
 do
 we
 know
 about
 the
 US's


commitment
 to
 overseeing
 the
 deal
 also


militarily
 overseeing
 the
 commitment
 to


the
 deal?
 I
 mean
 certainly
 in
 terms
 of


overseeing
 the
 deal
 from
 a
 sort
 of


political
 and
 logistical
 perspective
 uh


the
 suggestion
 is
 that
 Trump
 would
 head


this
 committee
 uh
 that
 would
 sort
 of


keep
 an
 eye
 on
 things
 and
 direct
 traffic


as
 it
 were.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 military


commitment
 I
 mean
 we
 did
 have
 a


statement
 from
 Sentcom
 that
 is
 the
 uh


the
 bit
 of
 the
 uh
 department
 of
 defense


that
 looks
 after
 the
 Middle
 East
 as
 well


as
 Central
 Asia
 and
 South
 Asia.
 They


said
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 200
 people
 on


the
 ground
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 without


spec
 specifying
 exactly
 where
 they
 will


be.
 Uh
 now
 SenCom
 has
 a
 forward
 base
 in


Katar,
 a
 rather
 large
 one.
 So
 I
 suppose


it's
 conceivable
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 it


from
 there,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone


should
 interpret
 that
 as
 a
 commitment


for
 US
 troops
 on
 the
 ground,


particularly
 in
 Gaza.
 And
 they
 they
 were


very
 clear
 they
 had
 no
 intention
 of


having
 troops
 stationed
 inside
 Gaza.


Stuart,
 our
 big
 take
 report
 today
 looks


at
 what's
 next
 in
 Gaza,
 feeding
 the


population,
 reconstruction
 and


governance.
 I
 mean,
 how
 big
 a
 challenge


is
 ahead
 for
 Gaza's
 future?


I
 mean,
 enormous.
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


arguably
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 big


biggest
 engineering
 challenges
 uh
 of


modern
 times
 just
 because
 of
 the
 scale


of
 destruction
 and
 the
 amount
 of


ordinance
 that
 has
 been
 that
 has
 been
 uh


dropped
 on
 Gaza,
 you
 know,
 that
 the
 the


just
 clearing
 the
 rubble
 and
 making
 it


safe
 so
 that
 you
 can
 start
 building


again
 is
 going
 to
 take
 an
 awful
 long


time.
 And,
 you
 know,
 we've
 had
 lots
 of


guesstimates
 out
 there.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how


accurate
 any
 of
 them
 could
 possibly
 be


given
 that,
 you
 know,
 there's
 so
 few


people
 that
 have
 actually
 gone
 and
 seen


what's
 what's
 there,
 but
 we
 did
 have
 a


reporter
 inside
 southern
 Gaza
 yesterday


and,
 you
 know,
 he
 certainly
 reported


back
 that
 it's
 exactly
 what
 you
 would


expect
 or
 what
 you
 what
 you've
 seen
 on


the
 photos
 that
 it
 is
 very
 widescale


destruction.
 So,
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 a


long
 time.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 of


money
 and
 it's
 not
 clear
 at
 this
 stage


quite
 where
 that
 funding
 is
 going
 to


come
 from
 or
 indeed
 who
 is
 going
 to


carry
 out
 the
 work.
 Uh
 but
 you
 know
 what


you
 can
 say
 on
 a
 more
 positive
 side
 is


that
 there
 is
 clearly
 a
 great
 deal
 of


goodwill
 uh
 to
 make
 progress
 here
 and
 to


try
 and
 ameliorate
 the
 situation.


Stuart,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being
 with


us
 this
 morning
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 follow


um
 all
 of
 the
 details
 as
 they
 emerge


from
 the
 Middle
 East.
 That
 is
 Stuart


Livingston
 Wallace,
 Bloomberg's
 head
 of


Middle
 East
 and
 North
 Africa
 coverage.


Thank
 you.


Stay
 with
 us.
 More
 from
 Bloomberg
 Dayb


coming
 up
 after
 this.


Now
 in
 France,
 we'll
 find
 out
 later


today
 who
 will
 be
 the
 country's
 next


prime
 minister.
 That
 person
 will
 need
 to


build
 a
 consensus
 around
 a
 budget
 on
 an


accelerated
 timetable
 after
 Sebastian


Nonu
 resigned
 from
 the
 job
 on
 Monday.


Richard
 Bravo,
 who
 leads
 our
 team


covering
 government
 and
 economics
 in


Western
 Europe,
 joins
 us
 now
 for
 more.


Rich,
 you
 and
 I
 have
 been
 in
 Paris
 all


week
 covering
 this
 story.
 Are
 we
 any


closer
 this
 Friday
 morning
 to
 knowing


who
 President
 Mron
 might
 pick?
 You
 know,


I
 don't
 think
 we're
 any
 closer
 to


knowing
 exactly
 who
 he
 will
 pick
 to
 be


the
 next
 prime
 minister,
 but
 the


important
 thing
 to
 focus
 on
 is
 the
 fact


that
 he's
 naming
 a
 prime
 minister
 at


all.
 Earlier
 this
 week,
 it
 was


increasingly
 looking
 like
 Macron
 would


call
 another
 snap
 election.
 That
 would


have
 meant
 even
 more
 political
 chaos
 and


financial
 instability.
 So
 even
 though


it's
 not
 clear
 who
 exactly
 Macron
 could


name
 and
 the
 list
 is
 very
 long
 and
 and


it
 does
 run
 the
 political
 gamut,
 um
 most


see
 this
 uh
 as
 the
 least
 bad
 option.
 So


um
 we're
 really
 looking
 forward
 to


seeing
 who
 he
 picks,
 which
 we're


expecting
 to
 find
 out
 later
 later
 this


evening.


Well,
 Bloomberg's
 been
 writing
 about
 how


business
 leaders
 have
 been
 courting
 the


Socialist
 Party
 leader
 Olivier
 for.
 How


important
 is
 he,
 do
 you
 think,
 to
 what


happens
 next?
 Well,
 in
 order
 to


understand
 the
 the
 political
 dynamics
 at


work
 here,
 um
 you
 have
 to
 look
 back
 to


last
 summer's
 European
 elections
 when


the
 far
 right
 made
 um
 historic
 gains
 in


France
 and
 that
 led
 Macron
 to
 call
 a


snap
 election
 in
 France
 cuz
 he
 thought


that
 um
 a
 new
 election
 might
 uh


reinforce
 his
 centrist
 coalition.


Unfortunately,
 the
 opposite
 thing


happened
 and
 the
 far
 right
 made
 even


even
 more
 gains
 and
 it
 fragmented
 the


National
 Assembly
 that
 effectively
 made


the
 socialist
 kingmakers
 in
 parliament


for
 anyone
 trying
 to
 form
 a
 workable


government.
 Um,
 so
 in
 effect,
 Olivia
 for


isn't
 an
 incredibly
 important
 uh


individual
 in
 in
 the
 grand
 scheme
 of


things.
 It's
 just
 that
 he
 leads
 a
 party


that
 is
 is
 necessary
 for
 anyone
 trying


to
 form
 a
 centrist
 government
 in
 France


at
 this
 moment.


So
 Rich,
 we've
 taken
 back
 out
 our
 guess


who
 boards
 to
 try
 and
 decide
 who
 might


be
 the
 next
 prime
 minister
 of
 France.


But
 when
 we
 do
 find
 out,
 how
 long
 will


this
 next
 prime
 minister
 have
 to
 make


progress
 before
 the
 spectre
 of
 snap


elections
 comes
 back?
 Well,
 that's
 a


really
 important
 question
 and
 the
 new


prime
 minister
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 act


very
 quickly.
 So,
 looking
 at
 the


timetable,
 the
 a
 new
 cabinet
 will
 have


to
 be
 named
 almost
 immediately
 and
 if


they
 want
 to
 pass
 a
 budget
 through
 the


normal
 process,
 that
 will
 have
 to
 be


proposed
 on
 Monday.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 time
 to
 to
 choose
 a
 cabinet
 and


get
 a
 very
 complicated
 uh
 budget


together.
 And
 that
 budget
 will
 need
 to


be
 passed
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 we


expect
 to
 see
 things
 move
 very
 quickly


and
 uh
 there
 really
 is
 no
 guarantee
 of


success
 in
 in
 any
 of
 this
 whether
 it's


naming
 a
 cabinet
 or
 getting
 a
 budget


together.
