Hello everyone, I'm Anthony
Welcome to my channel
today
I want to talk to you about a recent
Hot topics on the Chinese internet
That is, NPD
or narcissistic personality disorder
The word itself
Just a
Clinical diagnostic terms in psychology
But after it went viral
This word has successfully spread
and evolved into a
A rather unique social phenomenon
Many people share their
Experiences with people suspected of having NPD
They suddenly discovered
Parents, partners,
Teachers and leaders
All of these may be potential NPD
From social media to short videos
How to identify complaints,
Escaping and fighting back against NPD parents,
Companion and boss content is everywhere
There are even psychology bloggers
NPD will be analyzed
As the core positioning of your account
It speaks for itself
At least in the eyes of the creators
The subject of NPD
Have a large enough and highly sticky
Vertical audience groups with strong viewing intentions
at the same time
As more and more creators join this discussion
Around the NPD concept
Soon a set of
Quite unique language system
Such as blood packs, flying monkeys, narcissistic supply,
Absorbing energy, etc.
Generally speaking
Determine whether a topic is relevant
The subconscious of the entire society
A key sign is
See if it can produce
Slang used by the public
Similar ecological niche to NPD
A few years ago
A very popular buzzword "giant baby"
They all originate from some kind of psychological discourse
But it quickly got out of its original context
Became a vague concept
A concept with a broad scope
This also reflects the Chinese society
Use moralization
and psychological diagnostic methods
To express the real pain in specific power relations
and dissatisfaction
This video
Let's try to analyze
The logic behind NPD narratives
I will post this video
Put it in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
and consultation topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
First, we say
Critical discourse on NPD
It is indeed of precious value
In my opinion
Its greatest positive value lies in
It makes many people
first
Able to use a specific word
To name those in toxic relationships
Unspeakable pain
It has also awakened many people's awareness of self-help
Many relationships in Chinese society
It is indeed poisonous
This is also the case with many videos on our channel
All analyzed
Before the concepts of NPD and PUA spread
Many people have been in their original families for a long time.
or psychological violence in a relationship
But their feelings are hazy,
Chaos and self-doubt
They might think:
"Am I too sensitive?"
"Am I overthinking it?"
“Why am I in this relationship
Always unhappy,
But I can’t tell what’s wrong with him.”
In the NPD discourse system
Especially
Several key concepts are widely circulated
Gave these vague pains
An exact name
This process of “naming”
It has a certain liberating power.
Like the gaslighting effect
Popularization of the word
It made many people suddenly realize:
It turns out that kind of thing that makes people constantly doubt their memory
and rational dialogue mode
A classic means of control
When someone says, "I never said that.
You remembered it wrongly."
or "You just love to daydream"
The victim can finally tell himself:
“This is not my problem,
It’s the gaslighting effect.”
This can
The heavy self-attack and guilt
Transformed into the recognition of external manipulation behavior
For example, the concept of triangulation
Explained precisely
That kind of interpersonal relationship in China
The pain of being compared and competed
For example, when your partner
Constantly praising the ex in front of you,
A colleague or even a stranger
Or being a parent
Always between you and your siblings
Creating conflicts
And always use other people's children to suppress you
When you are confident
You know what you evoke
That unspeakable discomfort is not accidental
But it stems from
This discourse itself
It's creating insecurity.
besides
NPD criticism also describes a complete set of
The Process of a Toxic Relationship
Allowing many people to see the full picture
For example, NPD is considered to be
It is easy to go from idealization to devaluation
Then to the abandonment mode
This model explains
Why many intimate relationships
Will fall from "heaven" to "hell"
Many people are confused about
Why was the other person so nice to me in the beginning?
Praise yourself to the sky
I said so many sweet words to myself
But after being together
But they began to be picky, belittle and suppress
Finally, he cruelly abandoned himself
This tendency to over-idealize others
and quickly belittle the other party's rapid switching
He is indeed a patient with narcissistic personality disorder
Common phenomena on the body
The NPD critical discourse names this phenomenon
Let the parties
No longer indulge in the illusion that "he loved me so much at the beginning"
But I saw clearly
The other person does not have the ability to love himself
therefore
Criticism of NPD on the Chinese Internet
Indeed to a certain extent
The external signs of a toxic relationship revealed
Teach many people to learn to recognize such relationships
This is indeed very valuable
However, we should also note that
Description and interpretation of NPD on the Chinese Internet
to a large extent
Deviating from rationality and common sense
This is actually not conducive to
How a person recovers from the trauma of a toxic relationship
For example, the Chinese Internet
portrays NPD as something that cannot be changed.
The existence of incomprehensible pure evil
and uses a lot of dehumanizing metaphors
For example, NPD is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
A vampire, an energy sucker.
They are demons, not humans.
Therefore, in principle we
It is impossible to understand the inner thoughts of NPD
NPD on the Chinese Internet
Often described as doing bad things
The party that does evil
They do evil at no cost
No psychological burden or guilt
Even take pleasure in it
They are good at gaining other people's trust
Use others and then abandon them
Because of this
They usually have good worldly achievements
With more wealth,
Power and more supporters
This is even more serious
The client's fear of NPD
But if NPD is really that powerful
Have the ability to understand people's hearts
And never feel guilt or pain
Do such people really exist?
Hidden here is a romanticized imagination of evil
It's like saying a person has given up on morality.
Abandoning empathy and compassion
Instead, you can get a
Devilish vitality
and secular abilities
This is a beautification to some extent.
However
Real narcissistic personality disorder
Although some
Have worldly achievements
But more people show social withdrawal
Having bad interpersonal relationships
NPD as described online
Possess the ability to deceive others' trust
The magic of controlling people's hearts
It's largely fictional.
According to this paper from Central China Normal University
Narcissistic personality disorder
Mainly manifested as social maladjustment
In the field of interpersonal relationships
There is considerable incompetence and pressure
A large proportion of people suffer from major depressive disorder,
Substance dependence or substance abuse
and have a higher risk of developing borderline personality disorder
Higher risk of suicide
This is actually easy to understand.
Because of the nature of NPD patients
Not too confident
But too fragile
All his exaggerations,
Showing off and aggressive behavior
They are just hiding their inner thoughts
The self on the verge of breaking
Idealization and devaluation
Alternating interpersonal relationship patterns
They are destined to be unable to maintain long-term
Healthy relationships and friendships
This deep sense of loneliness
The source of their pain
and
A person who is accustomed to blaming others and being jealous of others,
People who exaggerate themselves
Maybe in some situations
Achieve success through temporary publicity
But their development
There is an obvious bottleneck
He might suddenly discover
The person you trust most
I don't really like myself
at this time
They go into narcissistic rages
However, when they hit a wall in reality
Discovering that the world doesn't revolve around your needs
result
They will fall into a depressive collapse again
So they could only retreat
Into a smaller social circle
Immersed in exaggerated fantasies
in other words
Mental Resilience in NPD
and empathy are relatively poor
These two abilities
For achievement
is indispensable
Although NPD is empathetic
and empathy difficulties
But that doesn't mean they don't suffer.
More adaptable to society
Quite the opposite
NPD patients are more vulnerable
More likely to feel pain
They just habitually
With a very destructive
and drinking poison to quench thirst to save themselves
See clearly that the other person is a poor patient
Although we still need to be vigilant and stay away from
But it can allow individuals
Remove the fear of the other person
That's it
Some might say
He actually met
The kind that is very good at applying pressure
At the same time, they can adapt well to social authority
Can't such a person be considered NPD?
I think this is indeed a
Common ways of thinking in Chinese society
It is a personalized
Psychological diagnosis to express
Dissatisfaction with structural oppression
Let's say a person
Behavior that oppresses and exploits another person
To a large extent
It's the environment he's in.
and the role he was assigned
It does not necessarily reflect
The stabilizing factors in this person's personality
In a country dominated by culture and institutions,
Empowered to a position of higher authority
A person is indeed prone to self-expansion
If he doesn't reflect
He will indeed behave
What this system expects
For example, the military is highly bureaucratic.
Or in companies or environments that encourage wolf culture
A leader oppresses and exploits employees
Probably not from
He has narcissistic personality disorder
But because
The system itself
Encouraging and rewarding this behavior
His behavior
Just adapting to this organizational culture
But he walked out of the scene
For example, when facing your superiors
or people outside the company
He might be empathetic.
Pathological NPD
Exaggeration of self
and the craving for narcissistic supply
is diffuse
In almost all relationships
Power alienates people
When a person
Under certain power advantages
He is indeed more likely to show
Lack of empathy
and the exploitative side
but
This may not generalize to all relationships.
Think carefully
Described by the Chinese Internet
That terrible NPD
This often happens when NPD has more power
Or in a scenario where there is an advantage
If NPD does not exist in reality
The power to control the parties involved
Or
The client is in a relationship with NPD
In a more advantageous position
So
Even if NPD verbally brags about himself
and demeaning the parties involved
No matter how you say it
The kind of manipulative words
Although the parties involved will feel uncomfortable
But it doesn't feel that scary
And it may feel ridiculous
because
He couldn't handle his real life.
Cause substantial impact
This explains
Empower those toxic words and actions
With great lethality
It is often not the words or actions themselves
The user's advantageous position
This is also why
Our Channel
Pay more attention to culture, environment,
The impact of the system on people
Try to avoid characterization of individuals
or a mental diagnosis
I don't think so either
Psychotherapy alone is a panacea
It's easy to label people
This is equivalent to admitting
Some people are born
Or it's inherently bad.
And this kind of badness is inexplicable
Although this is just beginning
Can give victims a sense of relief
However, in the long run
It will hinder a person from recovering from trauma.
because
Reducing evil to an inexplicable essence
Even though it makes one feel
I am completely powerless, innocent and pure
But it also feels inoperable
Not knowing how to act
The result is that he seems to have been living in
In the fight against this diffuse evil
Living with a sense of persecution
therefore
We need to assume that human nature is universal.
I understand a bad guy from a psychological perspective
does not mean
I want to be realistic
To forgive and reconcile
Just to disenchant
This way we can
From an inexplicable almighty devil
Restored to a flawed, predictable behavior
Even poor and miserable people
Once this devil is restored to human form
His psychological control over me
It has been greatly weakened
His manipulation skills are no longer a dragnet.
It's just a clumsy trick of an insecure person.
This also makes us no longer live in a
Persecuted by powerful forces
In a sense of powerlessness
For example, I saw an article
Articles introducing NPD cases
That's what it says
Male NPD in the early stages of a relationship
Will deliberately create a secular sense
Popular
A personality that easily wins the favor of women
Come closer to the blood bag
at the same time
Since NPD has no stable self
So the imitation ability is very strong
You can copy and plagiarize the good qualities of people around you
Then
This article lists several types of male NPD
For example, you are approached by a man
He revealed it intentionally or unintentionally
He is very rich
The circle of friends is also full of photos of traveling around
And drove a luxury car to pick you up
Just when you thought
When I started a sweet love
Suddenly saw someone expose him
Saying his character is fake
The photo is stolen
The luxury car is rented
Even the age is fake.
After reading this passage
I think
This doesn't sound like a description of a liar.
Rather, it seems to be describing
A very talented actor
An artist who understands human nature
So that it sounds
Like a hidden compliment to this NPD
But even if we don't consider morality
Just from a practical point of view
This kind of person who pretends to be rich
Strategies to gain women's trust
It's also very stupid.
Far from being brilliant
First, for a
For those who are not rich
Rent luxury cars, buy high-end imitation luxury goods,
Pretend to spend money at a high-end restaurant
This itself
You need to invest a certain amount of money
And you have to create a false identity
and corresponding life experiences
This requires the parties
Remember the countless lies you've told
Fabricate countless details to avoid being exposed
Many people
May not have experience with fake identity
have no idea
This kind of lying is very exhausting.
Maybe a moment
was discovered and exposed by the other party
More importantly
The benefits of this strategy
It is also very unstable
I strongly disagree
That sentence in this article
that is
This kind of person is easy to be favored by women
In fact
For many people with independent judgment
For women who are pursuing spiritual goals
This eagerness to show off one's wealth
Men who create a successful persona
It just makes people feel greasy.
Insincere, too purposeful, and alarming
Therefore, this strategy
It only attracts some women.
That is to attach great importance to material conditions
Having experienced financial trauma and deprivation
People who lack judgment
This strategy is also very fragile.
Because as long as in any link
Being discovered by the other party
Then your initial financial investment
and spiritual engagement
It's all gone to waste
I really can't see
What's so terrible about this strategy?
This article also describes another type of NPD
Feminist men
This is also a very interesting type
The article says that some men have NPD
Like to call herself a feminist
On his bookshelf
There are books like "Misogyny"
Feminist quotes
A token of love for you
Both are from Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex
But when you're with him
But I found that he was not sincere
He once said
Women don't owe anyone beauty
Now PUA you are fat and ugly
He clearly said
Women's fertility damage should not be ignored
Now I'm urging you to have a baby
Finally one day you discovered
He made a lot of misogynistic remarks
and
Teaching others to wear the cloak of feminism
Having sex with women
You also found
He bought more than a dozen copies of The Second Sex
I've given many blood packs.
To be honest, I think
The dangers of this NPD
It's also been greatly exaggerated.
Because this kind of feminist man
Strategies to gain women's trust
Also quite low returns
and high-risk
It's even more unreliable than pretending to be rich
Its target group is women
Several conditions must be met
First, this woman
Need to highly identify with feminist ideas
And use it as an important criterion for choosing a spouse
Second, she must be relatively theoretical
Easily influenced by book concepts
Abstract and empty slogans impress
Third, she must
Lack of social experience and judgment
So that
Unable to get into the details of early interactions
Identify
Inconsistency between the other person's words and actions
This intersection is quite narrow.
For those who don’t know much
Feminist theory for women
This show is meaningless.
For women who think deeply
This excessive force
Superficial rhetoric
It's also a cause for concern
Pretending to be a rich man only requires props
But pretending to be a certainist
Go and deal with people who like this theory
It's going to be more difficult
This requires a higher level of knowledge
and logical ability
A misogynist
In the continuation
When constantly outputting various opinions
Almost impossible
Not revealing one's true values
In this author's description
We feel
It seems like women's judgment
Set very low
It seems that this feminist male NPD
After saying a few incantatory theories,
Slogans and quotes
Can hypnotize women
Let women completely give up their own observation and judgment
Trust each other wholeheartedly
This makes us feel
This
Rendering and describing the dangers of NPD
It's a kind of hidden degradation of women.
certainly
It is also not conducive to individuals recovering from trauma.
