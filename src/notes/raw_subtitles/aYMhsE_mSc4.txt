If
 you
 had
 $100,000
 to
 grow
 your


software
 business,
 would
 you
 invested
 in


ads
 or
 in
 a
 sport?
 When
 all
 eyes
 over


the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks
 have
 been
 on


Lovable's
 hackathon
 and
 the
 team
 that


built
 and
 sold
 a
 startup
 in
 20
 hours,


Lovable
 made
 another
 announcement.
 The


announcement
 that
 did
 not
 get
 as
 much


media
 attention,
 but
 the
 one
 that
 shows


how
 drastically
 AI
 companies
 are


changing
 the
 technological
 landscape.


Lovable
 is
 now
 the
 official
 sponsor
 of


the
 company
 called
 Take

Take Take
 the
 company
 that
 happens
 to


belong
 to
 one
 of
 the
 best
 chess
 grand


masters
 of
 our
 time,
 Magnus
 Carlson.
 In


2010s,
 the
 typical
 growth
 path
 for
 any


software
 business
 was
 SEO,
 paid
 ads,
 and


a
 neverending
 cycle
 of
 optimizations.


But
 15
 years
 later,
 we're
 entering
 the


age
 of
 culture
 native
 growth,
 which
 will


replace
 spray
 and
 prey
 ads
 faster
 than


ever.
 Why
 did
 lovable
 do
 it?
 Of
 all


possible
 communities,
 why
 chess?
 Stick


around
 to
 find
 out
 why,
 because
 this


video
 will
 blow
 your
 mind.
 We're


starting
 a
 series
 of
 videos
 exploring


the
 fundamental
 changes
 and
 how
 tech


companies
 grow
 in
 the
 AI
 first
 era.
 And


today's
 episode
 is
 dedicated
 to
 the


economics
 of
 growth
 and
 distribution
 and


why
 the
 way
 companies
 grow
 has
 changed


forever.
 Let's
 dive
 in.


Let's
 talk
 about
 distribution
 and
 why


it's
 so
 incredibly
 important
 for
 a


software
 business.
 Distribution
 is


basically
 various
 ways
 through
 which
 an


app
 or
 a
 software
 platform
 is
 delivered,


sold,
 or
 how
 it
 gets
 into
 your
 hands.


Historically,
 distribution
 has
 always


been
 marketing's
 problem.
 And
 marketing


had
 plenty
 of
 tactics
 in
 their


possession
 on
 how
 they
 could
 distribute


a
 product.
 Distribution
 could
 be
 owned,


meaning
 that
 it
 was
 the
 marketing
 team


themselves
 who
 owned
 distribution


channels.
 A
 marketing
 team
 would
 pay
 for


SEO.
 They
 would
 write
 content.
 They


would
 create
 landing
 pages
 with
 examples


and
 use
 cases
 on
 how
 to
 drive
 traffic.


In
 other
 words,
 it
 was
 done
 through


everything
 that
 marketing
 could
 buy
 and


control.
 Distribution
 can
 also
 be
 done


through
 partnerships.
 For
 example,
 if


you
 put
 your
 app
 inside
 somebody
 else's


app.
 Examples,
 Trello
 and
 Slack,
 Sneak


and
 GitHub,
 Zoom
 and
 Salesforce.
 Another


variation
 of
 partnerships
 are
 things


like
 conferences,
 influencer


collaborations,
 and
 organic
 referrals
 to


gain
 users
 without
 paying
 for
 ads.
 And


lastly,
 distribution
 could
 be
 done


through
 product
 native
 channels,
 meaning


the
 product
 itself
 has
 a
 built-in


organic
 sharing
 with
 other
 people.
 A


great
 example
 is
 Zoom.
 Remember
 how
 Zoom


took
 virtual
 call
 space
 by
 storm
 in


2020?
 I
 got
 to
 admit,
 they
 hit
 a
 combo.


Yes,
 they
 were
 very
 heavy
 on
 viral


product
 features
 by
 nature,
 but
 also
 the


timing.
 Pandemic
 was
 an
 ideal
 time
 for


them
 to
 capitalize
 on
 their
 growth,
 but


the
 point
 still
 stands.
 Products
 that


have
 organic
 mechanisms
 that
 can
 create


virality
 by
 design
 become
 their
 own


distribution
 channel.
 If
 you
 were
 a


founder
 in
 2010s,
 prior
 to
 co
 all
 of


your
 growth
 was
 heavily
 focused
 on
 a


combination
 of
 paid
 marketing
 content


like
 blog
 posts
 or
 videos,
 partnerships,


and
 direct
 sales.
 Everybody
 was
 growing


their
 businesses
 on
 Google
 ads
 and


LinkedIn
 ads.
 Some
 companies
 were


different.
 HubSpot
 and
 Salesforce,
 the


legends
 of
 B2B
 world,
 were
 pioneers
 in


content
 distribution.
 They
 started


creating
 educational
 posts,
 webinars,


white
 papers,
 and
 even
 those
 flywheels


that
 were
 circulating
 LinkedIn.
 Dropbox


came
 up
 with
 what
 would
 later
 become
 a


staple,
 the
 refer
 a
 friend
 mechanics,


which
 at
 the
 time
 in
 the
 B2B
 software


space
 was
 a
 revolutionary
 technique
 that


brought
 the
 massive
 adoption.
 But
 then


we
 hit
 a
 turning
 point
 and
 that
 point
 is


called
 productled
 growth.
 PLG
 arose
 as
 a


response
 to
 those
 traditional
 sales
 and


marketing
 heavy
 growth
 strategies.
 In


simple
 terms,
 when
 a
 product
 follows
 the


PLG
 model,
 a
 user
 can
 onboard


themselves.
 They
 can
 invite
 others.
 They


can
 pay
 for
 the
 product
 without
 having


to
 call
 the
 sales
 team.
 The
 world's
 top


tech
 companies
 that
 you
 have
 definitely


heard
 of
 Mero,
 Canva,
 Figma
 or
 Pendo


either
 adapted
 to
 that
 growth
 or
 built


with
 the
 PLG
 model
 from
 the
 start.
 But


most
 of
 software
 market
 was
 still
 stuck


in
 hardcore
 sales
 and
 marketing.
 The


pandemic
 caused
 a
 dramatic
 change
 when


remote
 work
 exploded
 and
 offline


services
 closed.
 The
 only
 remaining


option
 for
 most
 businesses
 was
 to
 go


online.
 Paid
 events
 and
 field
 sales


dried
 up
 and
 businesses
 had
 to
 shift
 to


online
 first
 model.
 So
 the
 very


productled
 growth
 became
 a
 staple.
 This


is
 the
 point
 that
 fundamentally
 changed


the
 growth
 of
 software.
 Let's
 compare


the
 economics
 of
 software
 businesses


pre-
 pandemic,
 post
 pandemic,
 and
 AI


first
 economy.
 Now,
 we're
 going
 to
 go


through
 some
 numerical
 comparisons,
 but


I
 promise
 it
 won't
 be
 boring.
 The
 math


is
 mindblowing,
 so
 stay
 with
 me.
 In


2010s,
 the
 cost
 of
 customer
 acquisition


was
 between
 $100
 and
 $300
 on
 average,


and
 it
 was
 largely
 driven
 by
 Google
 and


LinkedIn
 ads.
 and
 sales
 team
 costs.
 But


during
 pandemic
 with
 the
 adoption
 of
 the


PLG
 model,
 these
 costs
 began
 dropping


from
 30
 to
 50%.
 Why?
 Because
 instead
 of


hiring
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 to
 onboard
 you,


you
 could
 now
 do
 the
 self-s
 serve.
 You


did
 not
 need
 sales
 or
 anybody
 else
 to


try
 the
 product.
 The
 concept
 of
 PLG
 also


gave
 rise
 to
 so-called
 growth
 loops,


user
 invitations
 and
 referrals,


collaboration
 features,
 content
 sharing


and
 templates,
 and
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 whole


community
 engagement
 in
 B2B.
 Dropbox's


referral
 program,
 for
 example,
 led
 to


almost
 a
 4,000%
 growth
 in
 user
 base
 over


15
 months.
 Figma's
 collaborative


features
 drove
 a
 20%
 month-over-month


increase
 in
 active
 teams
 during
 2020.


And
 then
 in
 the
 AI
 economy,
 the
 already


reduced
 customer
 acquisition
 cost
 gets


reduced
 even
 more
 through
 AIdriven


targeting.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


margins,
 the
 metric
 that
 is
 the


foundation
 of
 profitability.
 In
 2010s,


B2B
 software
 businesses
 had
 80
 to
 90%


margin
 due
 to
 minimal
 variable
 cost


because
 there
 was
 very
 little
 support


and
 maintenance
 that
 had
 to
 be
 done


after
 the
 product
 was
 built.
 Remember


the
 analogy
 from
 the
 previous
 video?
 It


costs
 almost
 nothing
 for
 Shopify
 to
 have


you
 as
 a
 customer.
 The
 same
 margins
 held


up
 through
 a
 pandemic
 and
 postpandemic.


But
 when
 AI
 blew
 up,
 businesses
 that


introduced
 AI
 features
 on
 top
 of
 their


existing
 platforms
 maintained
 the


margins.
 But
 AI
 first
 businesses
 where


the
 core
 product
 is
 an
 AI
 application


that
 doesn't
 work
 without
 AI,
 doesn't


solve
 any
 problem
 without
 AI,
 doesn't


exist
 without
 AI,
 60%
 at
 best.
 I'm


pausing
 here
 to
 show
 you
 evidence
 on


margins
 in
 AI
 native
 B2B.
 Multiple


resources
 confirm
 that
 it's
 between
 40


and
 60%
 with
 60
 being
 best-in-class.
 The


key
 drivers
 of
 costs
 in
 prepandemic


software,
 it
 was
 always
 sales.
 In


pandemic
 and
 PLG
 era,
 it's
 always


infrastructure
 because
 like
 I
 said


before,
 the
 cost
 of
 acquiring
 a
 customer


went
 down.
 But
 in
 AI
 first,
 it's


computing
 costs.
 And
 finally,
 the
 key


metric
 that
 quantifies
 the
 return
 on


investment
 for
 every
 dollar
 spent
 on
 a


new
 customer.
 In
 2010s,
 it
 was
 the
 ratio


of
 the
 lifetime
 value
 of
 a
 customer
 to


the
 customer
 acquisition
 cost.
 This
 was


the
 most
 important
 metric
 and
 the
 number


one
 reason
 why
 SAS
 businesses
 collapsed.


The
 golden
 standard
 was
 the
 3:1
 ratio.


There
 were
 plenty
 of
 examples
 when


software
 businesses
 collapsed
 because


they
 couldn't
 fix
 this
 metric.
 One
 of


the
 most
 notable
 and
 recognizable


examples
 was
 actually
 not
 a
 software


business,
 but
 still
 the
 Smile
 Direct


Club.
 In
 the
 software
 world,
 a
 good


example
 is
 Outreach,
 who
 by
 the
 way


managed
 to
 recover.
 Early
 on,
 they


aggressively
 spent
 on
 sales
 and


marketing
 to
 acquire
 enterprise


customers,
 but
 their
 cost
 of
 acquisition


was
 far
 too
 high
 relative
 to
 their


lifetime
 value.
 Later
 on
 in
 late
 2010s


and
 moving
 into
 post-pandemic
 absolute


northstar
 became
 the
 net
 revenue


retention
 or
 NRR
 was
 the
 metric
 in


product
 management
 still
 is
 but
 in
 AI


first
 it's
 contribution
 margin


contribution
 margin
 is
 the
 amount
 of


revenue
 left
 after
 subtracting
 the


variable
 costs.
 Do
 you
 see
 how
 the


narrative
 has
 changed?
 You
 can
 feel
 the


turbulence
 and
 the
 massive
 shift
 that


happened
 over
 the
 past
 5
 years
 by


looking
 at
 the
 metrics
 that
 mattered
 the


most.
 We
 went
 from
 retention-based
 goals


to
 revenue
 goals
 to
 let's
 hope
 we
 stay


afloat
 goals.
 The
 economics
 of
 an
 AI


first
 business
 is
 a
 different
 beast
 on


every
 level.
 So
 if
 this
 is
 the
 situation


we're
 dealing
 with,
 how
 do
 you
 as
 a


business
 make
 this
 math
 make
 sense?
 What


did
 Lovable
 do?
 Lovable
 quickly
 realized


that
 the
 traditional
 growth
 doesn't
 work


in
 AI.
 Let's
 come
 back
 to
 what
 we


started
 this
 video
 with
 the
 sponsorship


of
 an
 online
 chess
 company.
 With
 this


move,
 they
 invest
 in
 the
 so-called


tentpoles
 where
 their
 ideal
 customer


already
 is.
 And
 they
 do
 it
 in
 a
 very


creative
 way.
 They're
 not
 betting
 on


casual
 users
 who
 just
 want
 to
 play


around
 with
 lovable
 and
 build
 a
 quick


prototype
 they
 can
 show
 at
 work.
 They're


betting
 on
 a
 community
 of
 potential


founders.
 The
 trick
 here
 is
 to
 recognize


where
 the
 potential
 founders
 are.


They're
 not
 just
 investing
 in
 a


community.
 They're
 investing
 in
 a


culture.
 The
 chess
 community
 isn't
 just


passionate.
 It's
 analytical
 and
 niche,


but
 global
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 It
 is
 a


highly
 engaged
 cultural
 ecosystem
 with
 a


massive
 monetization
 potential.


Sponsoring
 Carlson's
 company
 taps
 into
 a


niche
 but
 incredibly
 engaged
 and
 what's


even
 more
 important
 monetizable
 global


community
 that
 is
 highly
 aligned
 with


their
 culture.
 Lovable's
 target
 audience


is
 ambitious,
 analytical,
 aspirational


developers
 and
 founders.
 On
 top
 of
 that,


they
 create
 a
 very
 strong
 campaign


around
 the
 moment
 of
 aspiration.
 That


hackathon
 they
 run
 is
 another
 example
 of


a
 new
 age
 marketing
 investment
 because


their
 brand
 already
 attracts
 people
 with


massive
 ambitions
 and
 the
 ones
 who


challenge
 the
 notion
 of
 impossible.
 I


mean,
 can
 you
 believe
 it?
 During
 that


hackathon,
 they
 had
 a
 team
 of
 four


people,
 I
 think,
 who
 built
 a
 product
 in


20
 hours
 and
 sold
 it.
 No
 marketing


tactics,
 no
 flashy
 demos
 or
 graphics
 can


beat
 that.
 Did
 they
 know
 it
 would


happen?
 Of
 course
 they
 didn't.
 They
 had


absolutely
 no
 idea.
 It
 was
 a
 bet,
 not
 a


blind
 bet,
 but
 still
 a
 big
 ambitious


bet.
 And
 the
 fundamental
 difference
 in


the
 growth
 motion
 for
 AI
 companies
 is


that
 they
 don't
 really
 do
 optimization.


For
 traditional
 software
 companies,


marketing
 and
 optimization
 was
 their


bread
 and
 butter.
 And
 AI
 native,
 they


don't
 do
 optimization.
 Well,
 actually,


let
 me
 take
 it
 back.
 It's
 not
 that
 they


don't
 do
 optimization.
 They
 don't
 have


time
 for
 it.
 And
 another
 thing,
 Lovable


is
 embracing
 the
 creator
 economy,
 which


is
 becoming
 a
 major
 factor
 in
 the
 growth


strategy
 for
 B2B
 software.
 The
 whole


point
 of
 these
 partnerships
 and
 the


community-led
 growth
 is
 the
 high


lifetime
 value
 and
 retention
 potential,


which
 aligns
 perfectly
 with
 the


imperatives
 of
 AI
 SAS
 unit
 economics.
 As


I
 was
 preparing
 for
 this
 video,
 the
 head


of
 growth
 at
 Lovable,
 Elena
 Vera,
 posted


an
 article
 about
 how
 growth
 is
 different


in
 AI
 companies.
 and
 she
 wrote
 a
 very


interesting
 observation
 saying
 that


marketing
 can't
 keep
 up
 with
 the


shipping
 velocity
 because
 marketing


teams
 were
 never
 designed
 for
 that
 kind


of
 velocity.
 That
 is
 exactly
 where
 that


fundamental
 difference
 is.
 This
 isn't
 to


say
 that
 all
 marketers
 are
 slow
 but


anyone
 who
 works
 in
 software
 business


knows
 that
 marketing
 especially
 for
 B2B


SAS
 takes
 time.
 But
 when
 you
 are
 AI


native,
 you
 can't
 afford
 to
 wait
 until


marketing
 finishes
 their
 research
 plan,


does
 the
 whole
 planning
 for
 the
 quarter


and
 only
 then
 starts
 executing.
 Another


trend
 that
 is
 huge
 in
 AI
 native
 software


is
 founderled
 sales
 and
 the
 whole
 brand


around
 the
 founder.
 For
 me
 personally,
 a


fantastic
 example
 of
 a
 founder
 growth
 is


the
 company
 called
 June.
 I
 have
 been


following
 the
 co-founder
 of
 this


company,
 Enzo
 Aviggo,
 for
 a
 long
 time.


And
 what
 blew
 my
 mind
 back
 when
 I


started
 following
 him
 is
 that
 he
 was


basically
 documenting
 how
 they
 were


building
 a
 business
 and
 they
 were


documenting
 the
 whole
 thing
 on
 LinkedIn.


If
 you
 go
 on
 his
 LinkedIn
 page
 and
 open


his
 post,
 you'll
 see
 that
 it's
 a
 manual


on
 how
 to
 build
 a
 software
 company.
 I


remember
 being
 so
 shocked
 that
 somebody


was
 actually
 writing
 everything
 and


making
 it
 public
 on
 LinkedIn
 because


it's
 the
 kind
 of
 content
 that
 I
 once


started
 creating
 on
 Substack.
 Yes,
 I
 had


a
 Substack
 very
 long
 time
 ago
 where
 I


was
 writing
 down
 my
 observations
 as
 a
 PM


working
 at
 a
 hyperrowth
 company
 that
 was


going
 through
 a
 massive
 scale,
 but


because
 I
 was
 an
 employee,
 the
 data
 was


not
 mine
 to
 share.
 So,
 my
 content
 wasn't


particularly
 interesting
 because
 because


it
 wasn't
 juicy.
 I
 could
 not
 write
 about


the
 actual
 numbers.
 And
 then
 after
 Enzo,


I
 started
 noticing
 that
 a
 lot
 more


founders
 are
 doing
 the
 exact
 same.
 And


Anton,
 the
 founder
 of
 Lovable,
 is
 no


exception.
 He
 doesn't
 document
 how


they're
 building
 Lovable
 per
 se,
 but
 if


you
 study
 Lovable
 as
 a
 company,
 if
 you


study
 them
 closely,
 you'll
 see
 that


Anton
 himself
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


brand.
 Since
 our
 last
 video
 on
 the


economics
 of
 AI
 blew
 up,
 I
 got
 several


hundred
 people
 follow
 me
 on
 LinkedIn.


And
 for
 that,
 I
 truly
 thank
 you.
 And


because
 I
 can
 now
 see
 with
 my
 own
 eyes


what
 kind
 of
 people
 watch
 us
 on
 YouTube,


I
 know
 for
 a
 fact
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 are


founders.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 needs
 to


hear
 this,
 but
 if
 you're
 an
 early
 stage


founder
 and
 you're
 building
 a
 solid


software
 product,
 a
 product
 that
 has
 a


strong
 AI
 component,
 and
 you
 are


dependent
 on
 LLMs,
 your
 product
 and
 your


branding
 have
 to
 go
 hand
 in
 hand.
 I


don't
 know if
 this
 comes
 as
 a
 surprise


to
 you,
 but
 do
 not
 rely
 on
 marketing


because
 they're
 not
 built
 for
 the
 speed


of
 LLMs.
 Your
 marketing
 will
 have
 to


ramp
 up
 and
 match
 you
 in
 speed,
 but
 you


cannot
 afford
 to
 lose
 the
 momentum.
 a


founder
 sales
 or
 a
 founder
 brand,
 you


are
 the
 brand
 and
 that
 is
 because
 the


culture
 always
 wins.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 age


when
 anything
 and
 everything
 can
 be


generated,
 deep
 faked
 or
 reproduced
 and


that
 is
 exactly
 why
 authenticity
 is
 the


highest
 currency.
 The
 data
 proves


exactly
 that.
 The
 cost
 of
 acquisition
 is


lower
 through
 organic
 advocacy.
 Compound


and
 network
 effects
 amplify
 growth
 and


creator
 economy
 enables
 scalable
 brand


storytelling
 because
 each
 creator
 will


have
 their
 own
 take
 on
 your
 product
 and


will
 open
 new
 channels
 to
 put
 your


product
 to
 use
 in
 ways
 that
 resonate


deeply
 with
 their
 audience.
 It's
 the


channels
 that
 you
 might
 not
 have
 thought


of
 yourself.
 Content
 and
 especially


founder
 content
 drives
 up
 to
 13
 times


higher
 return
 on
 investment
 compared
 to


non-blogging
 businesses.
 So
 if
 you're
 a


founder,
 a
 growth
 leader,
 a
 sea
 suite


member,
 ask
 yourself
 in
 the
 AI
 era,
 will


you
 spend
 your
 next
 $100,000
 on
 ads
 or


invest
 in
 a
 culture
 that
 turns
 users


into
 advocates,
 creators,
 and
 founders?


Lead
 with
 culture.
 Lead
 with
 your
 brand.


Lead
 with
 you.
 As
 always,
 we
 hope
 this


was
 helpful.
 We'll
