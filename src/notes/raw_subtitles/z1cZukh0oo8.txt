How is the consumer doing?
Well, thanks for having me, Carolyn
Bailey.
It's great to be here again.
You know, we had a real strong quarter.
Four consecutive quarters of high single
digit growth and record gross margins,
as well as the fact that we were able to
raise our full year guidance by as well
as gross margin and EPS expectations.
Overall, as a company, we're a stronger
and higher performing company defined by
accelerated growth, expanding margins
and higher return on invested capital.
Your question about the consumer, the
consumer is largely being resilient.
You know, our products are really well
segmented.
You know, we have blue tie, which we
which is our premium high pinnacle
product, and that's doing well.
We've introduced that in the US.
So far, so good.
We have a red product that is basically
marketed to consumers who earn between
100,000 and over.
And that's, you know, based on our
results really done well.
And then we have, you know, a signature
product sold through Wal-Mart that
again, had a banner, Coca-Cola.
And that's for, you know, lower income
consumer.
So consumer strength really strong.
That's why we were able to raise the
full year guidance.
And our product pipeline hasn't been
stronger.
Now, if you go outside the U.S.
and international business was up in the
high single digit, and so Asia had a
strong core, consumer strong.
Europe had a decent quarter.
Consumer in a better place.
And so is Latin America.
Well, I'm just going to lay it out for
you.
I think I bought my first pair of Levi's
in a long time, just a couple of months
ago.
My daughter, who's 22, so much younger
than me, has been buying Levi's for a
while, so barely.
I mean, they're back.
I go into the store in downtown, in in
the village, and yeah, it's packed.
Or you get a partnership with Beyonc√©.
All the marketing you guys are spending
in terms of targeting both young and
older generations.
But Harmeet, I want to ask about
tariffs.
So Levi expects tariffs from China about
30%, but increase expectations to 20%
from the rest of the world.
Where are you sourcing your jeans
materials?
Is it more are you more exposed to that
doubling in terms of are you getting
materials from Vietnam in place of
China?
Yeah.
So overall, we're taking a holistic
approach as we are able to offset the
tariff impact.
You know, as you think about this year,
we raised guidance in the top line and
the bottom line and gross margin.
So, you know, we've been able to
withstand that specific question, barely
resource about a 1% we import into the
U.S.
from China, a little over a percent from
India.
Most of and Vietnam is in the mid to
high single digit.
So most of our imports are from the
Southeast Asian countries think
Bangladesh.
I think Pakistan and and the rest of
Asia.
The way we think about our supply chain,
it's fairly well diversified.
We import from about 20 countries into
the U.S.
60% of our business is outside the U.S.
And so we are well positioned to
mitigate and offset tariffs in the way
we are thinking about the holistic
approach, given that volume is driving a
big piece of our, you know, revenue
momentum and we have tenured vendor
relationships, we're working with our
vendors, we're looking at different cost
efficiencies across our organization as
well as, you know, being very thoughtful
about pricing.
So let me just ask you, though, you
guys, did you know, you mentioned you
raised your full year outlook.
You did warn that tariffs are starting
to bite profit profitability to measure
by gross margins improve.
So these are the good stuff.
But again, that tariffs are starting to
bite.
I mean, can you tell us what that means,
what the bite of tariffs, when, when,
how much you know, any color around
that?
Sure.
So, you know, we're all you know, we
were able to raise top line and bottom
line guidance despite absorbing tariffs.
And so we are able to mitigate it.
To the question about tariffs.
Yeah.
You know, tariffs were introduced on
Liberation Day.
We normally buy our products, you know,
six months in advance.
And so, you know, we are working
through, you know, our efforts and we've
got different levers to kind of position
as who take order through the quarter,
which is reported gross margins are red
card.
So we are able to offset tariffs because
we've got other things working for us.
You know, as we grow our women's
business, our direct to consumer
business and international, all of which
are accretive to gross margins and allow
us to, you know, mitigate and offset
some of the tariff exposure.
Quarter four, we did good gross margins
to be slightly down versus a year ago.
And had it not been for tariffs, you
know, we would have grown gross margins.
But overall, as we think about the year,
we will report again another year of
record gross margin.
So we are working on levers for 2026.
The good news is we'll end the year
stronger and we believe we're well
positioned to have another strong year
in 2026.
And Carol, we've talked with a good
friend, Peter Atwater, for quite some
time about that k-shaped recovery, where
people who are well-off are doing much
better than those really in the bottom
quintile.
Harmeet, when you look at your goods,
when you look at the ability to raise
prices from the impact of tariffs, which
products are you able to more easily
raise prices where you are going to see
consumers push away?
And how are you thinking about that
strategy as it relates to, say, the
jeans that you do sell through a Walmart
where you don't have that gross margin
going direct to consumer and you do have
likely, at least when we look at the
data consumer who's feeling the pinch of
inflation, broadly speaking.
Yeah.
And so the first thing Baily, to your
question is our products are well,
segmented depending on the income
profile of different consumers.
I talk blue to red.
And signature signature is what's sold
into the lower income consumer.
We've been very thoughtful about
pricing.
We're leading with product innovation
rather than price.
And so we're doing what we can to
maintain a price point.
It was evident in quarter three
Signature, for example, I think is up in
the low double digits for the year.
As we think about, you know, our other
products.
The good news for us is our product
pipeline has never been stronger, you
know, leading with lose and baggy while
at the same time selling a lot of slim
and skinny both for him and her.
You know, we've got wonderful, you know,
waist up product the thing trucker
jackets, think linen shirts, etc., etc..
And so as a company, we're making this
pivot to be more of a denim lifestyle
retailer going forward.
Our past was all about denim.
Our future is going to be about denim
lifestyle.
