Gold
 is
 hitting
 new
 highs
 as
 global


tensions
 and
 trade
 wars
 show
 no
 signs
 of


abadating.
 What
 a
 momentum
 trade
 for
 the


yellow
 metal.
 Gold
 has
 now
 risen
 over


20%
 since
 the
 dovish
 shift
 from
 the
 Fed


back
 in
 Jackson
 Hole
 back
 in
 August,


crossing
 4,000
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever.


And
 as
 the
 price
 booms,
 African
 nations


are
 doing
 their
 best
 to
 cash
 in.


Cumulatively
 from
 January,
 exports
 from


the
 smallcale
 sector
 reached
 51.5


tons,
 which
 is
 valued
 at
 approximately
 5


billion
 US.


On
 today's
 next
 Africa
 podcast,
 we'll


look
 at
 how
 goldri
 countries
 can


capitalize
 on
 the
 price
 rises
 and
 how


big
 the
 windfall
 could
 really
 be.


I'm
 Jennifer
 Zabasa
 and
 this
 is
 the
 Next


Africa
 podcast
 bringing
 you
 one
 story


each
 week
 from
 the
 continent
 driving
 the


future
 of
 global
 growth
 with
 the
 context


only
 Bloomberg
 can
 provide.


Bloomberg's
 Africa
 Mining
 and
 Metals


correspondent
 William
 Clauss
 and
 our


precious
 metals
 reporter
 Jack
 Ryan
 are


both
 with
 me
 this
 week.
 Thank
 you
 both


so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.
 Jack,
 let's
 just


start
 with
 you.
 Last
 time
 we
 were


talking
 about
 gold
 on
 this
 podcast,
 the


the
 price
 was
 creeping
 up
 to
 3,000.
 Many


people
 have
 their
 predictions
 for
 the


end
 of
 2025,
 but
 now
 we're
 seeing
 the


metal
 around
 4,000.
 What's
 what's
 some


of
 the
 factors
 behind
 the
 rising
 price?


Recently,
 there's
 been
 kind
 of
 like
 this


long
 laundry
 list
 of
 things
 that
 have


been
 driving
 gold
 higher.
 So
 we
 had


obviously
 the
 resumption
 of
 rate
 cuts


and
 that's
 good
 for
 gold
 because
 gold


obviously
 doesn't
 pay
 interest.
 So
 when


interest
 rates
 become
 lower
 then
 it


becomes
 more
 appealing
 relative
 to
 cash.


So
 that's
 something
 that
 the
 market
 has


priced
 in
 and
 it's
 priced
 in
 further


rate
 cuts.
 And
 then
 beyond
 that
 we've


had
 things
 like
 the
 attacks
 or
 the


perceived
 attacks
 on
 the
 independence
 of


the
 Federal
 Reserve.
 And
 that
 I
 think
 is


something
 that
 really
 got
 the
 attention


of
 people
 who
 are
 invested
 in
 gold


because
 then
 you
 get
 the
 potential
 for
 a


kind
 of
 goldilock
 situation
 where
 you


have
 low
 rates
 if
 you
 have
 a
 kind
 of
 Fed


and
 potentially
 hotter
 inflation.
 Gold


also
 is
 seen
 as
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 inflation


hedge.
 So
 kind
 of
 a
 heads
 I
 win
 tails


you
 lose
 scenario
 for
 gold.
 swirling


beyond
 that.
 I
 think
 probably
 most


people
 would
 agree
 more
 geopolitical


tension
 in
 the
 world
 than
 there
 has
 been


maybe
 five
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 all
 of
 that


stands
 to
 benefit
 gold.


Goldilocks,
 no
 pun
 intended.


Exactly.


William,
 jump
 in
 here.
 When
 we
 take
 a


look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 big
 gold
 producers


on
 the
 continent,
 have
 we
 seen
 them
 all


benefit
 from
 this
 current
 wave
 of


enthusiasm?
 So
 when
 we
 talk
 about


African
 countries
 which
 do
 produce


significant
 volumes
 of
 gold,
 we're


talking
 about
 quite
 a
 few
 of
 them.
 The


likes
 of
 Ghana,
 Mali,
 South
 Africa,


Bikina,
 Faso,
 Sudan,
 Guiney's,
 Zimbabwe,


and
 the
 DRC.
 And
 that
 that's
 not
 all
 of


them.
 And
 between
 those
 countries,


you've
 got
 a
 sort
 of
 differing
 mix
 of


types
 of
 gold
 production.
 So
 on
 the
 one


hand
 you've
 got
 the
 sort
 of
 big


industrial
 commercial
 formal
 operations


owned
 by
 well-known
 multinational
 miners


like
 Barrack
 or
 Anglo
 Gold
 or
 Goldfields


and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 you've
 got
 this


production
 which
 is
 done
 by
 hand
 and


rudimentary
 tools
 and
 one
 of
 the
 big


problems
 for
 African
 governments
 not


just
 now
 but
 for
 for
 a
 long
 time
 has


been
 this
 second
 kind
 of
 gold
 mining


which
 is
 often
 unauthorized
 and
 illegal


which
 results
 in
 most
 of
 the
 gold
 being


smuggled
 out
 of
 the
 countries
 and


therefore
 doesn't
 benefit
 their


treasuries
 at
 all.
 So
 the
 the
 easiest


way,
 the
 most
 obvious
 way
 in
 which


African
 countries
 are
 benefiting
 right


now
 is
 the
 countries
 that
 have
 more
 of


these
 big
 industrial
 operations,
 places


like
 Ghana,
 Tanzania,
 Mali,
 and
 you


know,
 they're
 making
 loads
 of
 money,


loads
 more
 money
 than
 before,
 just


because
 the
 royalties
 they're
 receiving,


in
 other
 words,
 a
 percentage
 of
 every


ounce
 of
 gold
 produced
 and
 exported
 have


shot
 up
 so
 much,
 even
 if
 overall
 output


hasn't
 changed
 a
 great
 deal.
 And
 it


isn't
 surprising,
 I
 guess,
 or
 it
 would


be
 surprising
 if
 it
 wasn't
 like
 this,


that
 some
 countries,
 I
 can
 think
 of


Ghana
 and
 Ivory
 Coast
 to
 name
 just
 two,


have
 been
 trying
 to
 capitalize
 even
 more


on
 the
 gold
 price
 by
 changing
 the
 rates


so
 that
 the
 state
 receives
 a
 bigger


chunk
 of
 the
 multinational
 companies


turnover
 from
 their
 countries.


Have
 they
 been
 successful
 in
 doing
 that?


Well,
 it's
 always
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 fight


because
 if
 you
 introduce
 new
 laws,
 it's


quite
 hard
 to
 implement
 changes
 to
 the


rates
 companies
 pay
 overnight
 because


often
 companies
 will
 argue
 that
 they


have
 clauses
 that
 mean
 they're
 exempt


from
 new
 legislation
 for
 a
 period
 of


time,
 maybe
 5
 years,
 maybe
 10
 years.
 So,


it's
 it's
 really
 really
 difficult
 to
 do


quickly.
 And
 the
 sort
 of
 most
 obvious


example
 of
 this
 has
 been
 in
 Mali
 where


the
 military
 government
 there
 has
 got


into
 the
 most
 almighty
 fights
 with
 its


biggest
 investor.


Yeah.
 And
 those
 contracts
 date
 back


years,
 decades.
 Uh
 William,
 you've
 spent


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 the
 DRC.


Let's
 dig
 into
 what
 we're
 seeing
 from


the
 country
 in
 particular
 and
 their


plans
 to
 increase
 extraction.
 Why
 does


that
 stand
 out
 to
 you?
 Well,
 Congo
 is


it's
 a
 bit
 odd
 in
 that
 there's
 tons
 and


tons
 of
 gold
 there,
 but
 it's
 only
 got
 a


single
 industrial
 mine.
 It's
 called


Gibbali,
 and
 it's
 co-owned
 by
 Barrack


and
 Anglo
 Gold.
 It's
 it's
 absolutely


massive.
 It's
 very
 impressive,
 but


there's
 only
 one
 in
 a
 country
 that


should
 probably
 have
 quite
 a
 few
 more


geologically
 speaking.
 And
 what's
 more,


the
 government
 thinks
 or
 says
 it
 thinks


that
 it
 loses
 out
 on
 about
 60
 tons
 of


gold
 smuggled
 out
 of
 the
 country
 every


year.
 Now
 that's
 that's
 worth
 more
 than


7
 billion
 at
 the
 moment.
 It's
 a
 poor


country
 and
 the
 government
 would
 very


dearly
 love
 to
 take
 its
 slice
 of


royalties
 and
 taxes
 from
 those
 volumes.


So
 in
 short,
 they
 haven't
 really
 been


able
 to
 do
 a
 great
 deal
 to
 increase


legal
 formal
 production
 because
 mines


take
 a
 long
 time
 to
 build.
 But
 there's
 a


new
 mines
 minister
 in
 town
 and
 what
 he's


trying
 to
 do
 and
 what
 he
 said
 he's
 doing


is
 that
 he's
 really
 focusing
 on
 deals


with
 gold
 miners
 both
 major


multinational
 players
 and
 smaller


exploration
 firms
 in
 an
 effort
 to


develop
 more
 operations
 like
 Cabali


where
 it's
 easier
 to
 capture
 the
 value


from
 that
 kind
 of
 production.


And
 William,
 what
 about
 in
 Ghana?
 What


are
 you
 watching
 for?
 What
 are
 some
 of


the
 projects
 there?


So
 Ghana
 is
 doing
 something
 interesting.


It's
 got
 plenty
 of
 these
 big
 industrial


operations
 run
 by
 international
 mining


firms,
 but
 it's
 also
 got
 loads
 of
 this


smallcale
 activity
 which
 is
 known
 as


artisal
 mining.
 And
 there's
 a
 new


government
 in
 Ghana
 which
 has
 been
 all


over
 that
 and
 trying
 to
 organize
 it


better
 and
 close
 the
 leaks
 and
 benefit


more
 from
 that
 industry
 than
 before.
 And


basically
 they've
 got
 this
 state-owned


body
 called
 the
 Ghana
 Gold
 Board
 that's


been
 set
 up
 to
 purchase
 and
 sell
 this


kind
 of
 production
 and
 it's
 in
 an
 effort


to
 curb
 smuggling
 and
 boost
 the
 local


currency.
 Nigeria's
 tried
 to
 do


something
 similar
 for
 years
 to
 let
 the


central
 bank
 buy
 all
 the
 gold
 and
 boost


its
 reserves
 like
 that,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 been
 as
 effective
 as
 in


Ghana.
 I
 don't
 think
 Ghana's
 released


the
 latest
 data
 for
 the
 third
 quarter


yet,
 but
 their
 gold
 board
 bought
 I
 think


it
 was5
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 gold
 in


the
 first
 six
 months
 and
 it
 says
 it


wants
 to
 buy
 more
 at
 least
 three
 tons
 a


week
 in
 the
 future
 and
 is
 aiming
 for


sales
 revenue
 up
 around
 sort
 of
 12


billion
 a
 year.
 Let's
 take
 a
 quick


break,
 William
 and
 Jack,
 and
 when
 we


come
 back,
 we'll
 unpack
 more
 about
 this


boom
 and
 potentially
 how
 long
 it
 will


last
 and
 whether
 or
 not
 some
 countries


are
 actually
 taking
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 risk


betting
 on
 the
 long-term
 high
 of
 the


precious
 metal.
 We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Welcome
 back.
 Today,
 we're
 talking
 about


gold's
 continued
 boom
 and
 the
 countries


across
 the
 continent
 looking
 to
 cash
 in.


William
 Clauss
 and
 Jack
 Ryan
 are
 still


with
 me.
 Jack,
 before
 the
 break,
 we


talked
 about
 some
 of
 the
 people
 on
 the


countries
 looking
 to
 cash
 in
 on
 this


price
 increase.
 How
 sustainable
 is
 the


price
 of
 gold
 right
 now,
 though?
 There's


a
 number
 of
 analysts
 that
 have
 their
 own


projections
 for
 the
 end
 of
 2025,
 but


could
 people
 start
 investing
 in
 more


extraction
 only
 to
 see
 the
 price
 start


to
 fall?
 I
 know
 that's
 a
 difficult


question
 to
 put
 to
 you.
 I
 think
 anytime


someone
 looks
 at
 a
 price
 chart
 and
 they


see
 a
 straight
 line
 going
 up
 for
 2


years,
 it
 probably
 should
 make
 them,
 you


know,
 nervous
 and
 maybe
 gold
 is
 a
 less


appealing
 investment
 now
 than
 it
 was
 2


years
 ago
 given
 it's
 more
 than
 twice
 the


price.
 I
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 miners


probably
 many
 of
 them
 will
 be
 hesitant


to
 you
 know
 ramp
 up
 their
 capbacks


invest
 rather
 than
 returning
 cash
 to


shareholders
 because
 I
 think
 the


philosophy
 now
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 kind
 of


investors
 share
 is
 that
 that's
 really


what
 miners
 should
 be
 focused
 on


disciplined
 about
 spending
 and
 handling


cash
 over.
 Most
 of
 the
 gold
 miners
 now


are
 make
 or
 nearly
 all
 of
 them
 are


making
 bonanza
 levels
 of
 profit.
 you


know,
 maybe
 cost
 them
 $1,200
 to
 $1,600


to
 dig
 an
 ounce
 of
 gold
 out
 of
 the


ground
 and
 now
 they're
 going
 to
 get


$4,000
 for
 it.
 So,
 they're
 really
 making


an
 incredible
 amount
 of
 money
 and


there's
 there
 and
 there's
 an
 incredible


margin
 there
 where
 gold
 could
 fall
 by


$1,000
 and
 they'd
 still
 be
 making
 lots


of
 money.
 The
 unusual
 thing
 about
 gold


is
 that
 supply
 the
 demand
 dynamics
 are


are
 not
 really
 so
 relevant
 when
 you're


trying
 to
 analyze,
 you
 know,
 where
 the


price
 will
 go,
 which
 is
 unlike,
 I
 think,


pretty
 much
 every
 other
 commodity
 that
 I


can
 think
 of.
 And
 that
 I
 think
 makes
 it


harder
 to
 analyze
 cuz
 really
 it's
 it's
 a


metal
 where
 the
 price
 is
 all
 about


sentiment.
 I
 think
 it
 will
 be
 stronger


supported
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 an
 end
 to
 some


of
 the
 trends
 that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


last
 few
 years
 in
 terms
 of
 maybe
 the


multilateral
 system
 and
 kind
 of
 trading


relationships
 and
 just
 positive


relationships
 between
 nation
 states


generally.
 If
 they
 don't
 continue
 to


deteriorate
 or
 if
 they
 begin
 to
 recover


then
 gold
 might
 suffer
 from
 that.
 But


other
 than
 that,
 most
 of
 the
 tailwinds


are
 still
 blowing
 in
 its
 at
 its
 back.


William,
 let's
 just
 talk
 about
 some
 of


the
 other
 risks
 for
 some
 of these
 gold


producers.
 Many
 of
 the
 countries
 with


the
 gold
 reserves
 are,
 you
 know,


relatively
 unstable,
 as
 we
 were


mentioning,
 controlled
 by
 military.


Honta
 is
 dealing
 with
 illegal
 miners.
 Do


you
 think
 that
 affects
 the
 appetite
 for


investors
 in
 some
 of
 the
 projects
 across


the
 continent?


I'd
 say
 so.
 Yeah.
 But
 it's
 I
 mean
 it's


hard
 to
 calculate
 how
 many
 more
 mines


there
 would
 be
 in
 places
 like
 Mali
 or


how
 much
 more
 investment
 if
 the


government
 was
 different
 or
 the
 security


situation
 was
 better.
 But
 what
 I
 would


say
 is
 that
 there
 are
 still
 a
 few


companies
 which
 want
 to
 build
 gold
 mines


in
 Mali
 and
 are
 raising
 money
 to
 do
 it


even
 after
 Barrack
 Mining
 got
 deep
 into


its
 problems
 and
 ended
 up
 losing
 its


mine
 at
 least
 on
 a
 temporary
 basis
 and


executives
 at
 another
 company
 were


detained
 and
 effectively
 held
 hostage


while
 Marley
 negotiated
 with
 that


company.
 You
 know,
 perhaps
 this
 company


I'm
 thinking
 of,
 it's
 called
 Dubani


Resources,
 is
 very,
 very,
 very
 brave.
 Or


maybe
 Barrett
 just
 played
 its
 hand
 very


poorly,
 but
 you
 know,
 there
 is
 still


interest.
 But
 if
 you
 you
 look
 at
 the


geology
 and
 gold
 deposits
 in
 some
 of


these
 riskier
 countries,
 there
 should
 be


more
 industrial
 mines
 there
 and
 there


would
 be
 more
 appetite
 at
 this
 time
 in


this
 market
 if
 say
 northeastern
 Congo


and
 Sudan
 were
 safer
 or
 Bikina
 Faso
 had


a
 different
 government.
 If
 we
 do
 see
 the


price
 continue
 to
 rise,
 does
 that
 affect


what
 you
 are
 paying
 attention
 to
 with


some
 of
 these
 projects
 or
 will
 they


continue
 to
 invest
 and
 push
 forward
 as


you
 were
 just
 mentioning
 regardless
 of


the
 price
 swings?


No,
 I
 don't
 think
 they'll
 push
 forward


regardless
 because
 there
 are
 other


places
 you
 can
 do
 this.
 So
 I
 think
 you


know
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of


Congo
 risk
 associated
 with
 building
 a


new
 industrial
 gold
 mines
 in
 Congo.
 It's


it's
 you
 know
 you
 see
 this
 with
 other


commodities
 when
 prices
 are
 skyhigh
 too


whether
 these
 reputations
 for
 being
 a


risky
 jurisdictions
 are
 deserved
 or
 not


and
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 African
 governments


would
 say
 they're
 unfairly
 treated
 in


the
 way
 they're
 seen
 by
 Western


investors
 in
 particular.
 It
 definitely


does
 act
 as
 a
 drag
 on
 investment
 that


probably
 would
 go
 in
 if
 the


consideration
 was
 based
 exclusively
 on


on
 geology
 and
 deposits.


William
 Claus
 and
 Jack
 Ryan,
 thank
 you


both
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us
 this
 week


and
 for
 your
 reporting.
 You
 can
 of


course
 read
 all
 the
 latest
 reporting
 on


gold
 across
 Bloomberg
 platforms.
 Now,


here
 are
 some
 of
 the
 other
 stories
 from


the
 region
 we've
 been
 following
 this


week.
 Nigeria
 is
 planning
 to
 raise
 as


much
 as
 $2.3
 billion
 in
 a
 euro
 bond
 sale


in
 the
 fourth
 quarter,
 potentially


joining
 other
 African
 issuers,
 taking


advantage
 of
 lower
 borrowing
 costs.
 And


Egypt
 is
 asking
 its
 liqufied
 natural
 gas


suppliers
 to
 delay
 shipments
 scheduled


for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 year
 on
 weaker
 than


expected
 demand.
 And
 you
 can
 read
 more


of
 these
 stories
 across
 Bloomberg


platforms
 now,
 including
 the
 Next


African
 Newsletter.
 We'll
 put
 a
