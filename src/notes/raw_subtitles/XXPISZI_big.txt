 in

 you
 will
 die.

[Music]


Hi
 guys.
 Okay,
 everybody
 stand
 up.
 Okay,


what
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 is
 you're
 going


to
 choose
 your
 left
 or
 your
 right
 foot.


I'm
 going
 to
 count
 down
 from
 three
 and


you're
 going
 to
 stay
 standing
 on
 your


selected
 foot
 as
 long
 as
 you
 can
 with


your
 eyes
 closed.
 Okay?
 Hands
 by
 your


side.
 You
 can't
 be
 out.
 It's
 got
 to
 be


close
 by.
 Your
 foot's
 got
 to
 be


somewhere
 close
 by.
 You
 can't
 be
 clear


out.
 Okay?
 So,
 just
 choose
 right
 or
 left


foot.


And
 those
 of
 you
 on
 the
 balcony,
 be


careful.


If
 somebody
 fell
 off,
 that'd
 be
 a
 bad


situation.
 Okay.
 Foot
 selected.
 Let
 me


pull
 out
 my
 timer.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to


count
 the
 number
 of
 seconds
 that
 pass.


Okay.


Ready?
 3
 2
 one.
 Close
 your
 eyes.


5
 seconds.


10
 seconds.


And
 your
 foot
 can't
 move.
 Stationary.


15.


20.
 Okay,
 we'll
 stop
 there.
 Who's
 Who's


still
 up?


Okay,
 good.
 Okay,
 good.
 We'll
 do
 it
 one


more
 time.
 All
 right,
 you
 got
 No,
 no,


stay
 up.
 This
 is
 a
 biological
 age
 test.


As
 you
 age,
 part
 of
 your
 brain
 that


keeps
 you
 well
 balanced
 atrophies
 and


you
 can't
 maintain
 a
 balance
 very
 well.


So,
 kids
 are
 very
 good
 at
 this.
 As
 you


age,
 you
 get
 worse.
 Okay.
 So
 if
 you
 are


uh
 between
 15
 and
 30
 seconds,
 that's


roughly
 age
 20
 to
 40.
 7
 to
 15
 seconds,


you're
 between
 40
 and
 60.
 And
 0
 to
 7,


you're
 60
 plus


>> as
 an
 age
 category.
 Okay.


Yep.
 All right.
 Ready?
 Okay.
 You
 can


choose
 again.
 Right
 or
 left
 foot?
 Your


foot's
 got
 to
 be
 stationary.
 You
 can't


move
 it
 around.
 Arms
 close
 by.
 Okay.


Three,


two,
 one,
 go.


Five.


10.


15.


20.
 Make
 it
 to
 30,
 you
 guys.
 10
 more


seconds.


30.
 Okay,
 cool.
 Good
 job,
 you
 guys.
 All


right,
 you
 can
 take
 a
 seat.
 This
 is
 the


neat
 thing
 about
 biological
 age
 testing


is
 you
 of
 course
 know
 when
 you
 were
 born


and
 therefore
 you
 know
 how
 many
 years


you've
 lived.
 You
 can
 look
 at
 yourself


in
 the
 mirror
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 I
 have


a
 few
 wrinkles
 or
 a
 few
 spots.
 But


actually
 in
 your
 body,
 your
 organs
 have


different
 ages.
 So,
 your
 lungs
 are
 a


certain
 age,
 your
 brain,
 your
 eyes,
 your


ears,
 your
 gums,
 your
 pancreas,
 your


liver,
 they're
 all
 different
 biological


ages.
 And
 it's
 really
 important
 to
 know,


for
 example,
 my
 left,
 so
 I'm
 47.
 My
 left


ear
 is
 64
 years
 old.


It's
 because
 I
 shot
 a
 lot
 of
 guns
 as
 a


kid.
 I
 was
 right-handed
 like
 this
 with
 a


lot
 of
 exposure
 in
 my
 ear.
 And
 I
 also


listen
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 loud
 music.
 And
 so


that's
 really
 important
 for
 me
 to
 know


because
 when
 you
 have
 hearing
 loss
 and


you
 don't
 correct
 for
 it
 with
 a
 hearing


aid,
 it
 can
 affect
 it
 can
 result
 in


cognitive
 decline.
 So
 this
 applies
 to


all
 things
 about
 the
 heart.
 And
 so
 a


couple
 years
 ago,
 I
 posed
 this
 question.


Are
 we
 really
 the
 first
 generation
 who


won't
 die?


It's
 kind
 of
 the
 coolest
 question
 in


existence.
 What
 matters
 more
 than
 our


experience,
 our
 ability
 to
 live?
 And
 so


to
 do
 this,
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 an


experiment.
 So,
 I
 measured
 the


biological
 age
 of
 every
 organ
 in
 my
 body


as
 much
 as
 we
 could.
 We
 then
 went


through
 the
 scientific
 evidence
 and
 we


tried
 to
 reverse
 and
 or
 slow
 down
 my


speed
 of
 aging.
 And
 what
 I've
 been


trying
 to
 do
 is
 create
 a
 sport
 or
 a
 new


genre
 of
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 healthy.


And
 so,
 I
 put
 my
 biomarkers
 out
 and


said,
 basically,
 I
 have
 the
 best


biomarkers
 of
 anybody
 in
 the
 world.


Anyone's
 willing,
 anyone's,
 you
 know,


capable
 of
 competing
 with
 me.
 But
 try
 to


make
 it
 like
 a
 quantified
 thing
 where


it's
 just
 like
 I'm
 healthy
 or
 not.
 And


so
 it's
 been
 a
 really
 fun
 journey.
 And


so
 today
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 guys
 in


just
 a
 few
 minutes
 time
 everything
 I've


learned
 about
 health.
 I'm
 going
 to


compress
 it
 into
 some
 very
 simple


lessons
 for
 you
 because
 health
 is
 really


complicated.
 It's
 very
 confusing.
 It's


all
 consuming.
 It's
 overwhelming.
 Cool.


>> Okay.


So
 first
 uh
 who
 got
 eight
 hours
 of
 sleep


last
 night?


Uh,
 7


6
 5
 4
 3


Thank
 you
 for
 your
 honesty.
 Two.
 There.


Thank
 you,
 sir.
 One.
 Yeah,
 I
 appreciate


that.
 Okay.
 Who
 has
 a
 confession
 to


make?
 Who
 recently
 polished
 off
 a
 bag
 of


chips,
 ate
 some
 ice
 cream,
 and
 then


jammed
 some
 Twizzlers?
 What
 did
 you
 do,


sir?


>> Chips.
 A
 whole
 bag.
 One
 sitting.
 All


right.
 Great.
 Who
 else?
 Yeah.
 What
 did


you
 do?
 Gelato.


>> Gelato.
 Yeah,
 I
 get
 it.
 Okay,
 cool.


Okay,
 so
 you
 guys,
 the
 single
 best
 thing


I've
 learned
 out
 of
 everything
 I've
 ever


done
 is
 your
 resting
 heart
 rate
 before


sleep
 is
 the
 best
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 for


your
 health.
 Hands
 down.
 Okay,
 so
 here's


what
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 tonight.
 Before


you
 go
 to
 bed,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a


baseline
 read.
 You're
 either
 with
 a


wearable
 or
 just
 on
 your
 fingers
 on
 the


neck.
 You're
 going
 to
 lay
 down
 on
 your


bed,
 take
 a
 few
 deep
 breaths.
 You're


going
 to
 find
 your
 resting
 heart
 rate.


Let's
 say
 it's
 60
 beats
 per
 minute.


Okay,
 your
 goal
 over
 the
 next
 month
 is


to
 lower
 your
 heart
 rate
 by
 10%
 or
 so.


So,
 if
 you're
 60,
 be
 down
 to
 54.
 And


here's
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 If


your
 bedtime's
 at
 10
 p.m.,
 eat
 your


final
 meal
 of
 the
 day
 at
 6
 p.m.
 After
 6,


no
 more
 food,
 no
 more
 snacks.
 Okay?
 By


doing
 that,
 you
 have
 you
 allow
 your
 body


to
 digest
 your
 food.
 And
 you're
 going
 to


see
 that
 as
 you
 do
 that,
 your
 heart
 rate


is
 going
 to
 go
 down.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


heart
 rate
 is
 so
 important
 is
 the
 lower


your
 heart
 rate
 is,
 the
 better
 your


sleep.
 The
 better
 your
 sleep,
 the
 better


your
 willpower.
 Did
 you
 know
 if
 you


don't
 sleep,
 your
 prefrontal
 cortex
 goes


offline
 and
 you
 lose
 your
 willpower.
 So


when
 you're
 trying
 to
 not
 eat
 the


cookie,
 you're
 powerless.
 You
 can't
 do


it.
 It's
 gone.
 So
 sleep
 is
 the
 best


performance-enhancing
 drug
 in
 the
 whole


world.
 It's
 the
 thing
 you
 want
 to
 do


every
 night.
 So
 first
 thing
 is
 eat
 your


final
 meal
 4
 hours
 before
 bed.
 Number


two
 is
 you
 need
 to
 turn
 your
 screens
 off


an
 hour
 before
 bed.
 Okay?
 Okay,
 now
 I


realize
 that's
 hard.
 We
 are
 all
 addicted


to
 our
 phones,
 but
 that
 1
 hour
 is
 so


important
 because
 you
 have
 to
 give
 your


body
 ability
 to
 wind
 down.
 And
 if
 you're


scrolling
 or
 working,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


in
 a
 roused
 state,
 which
 boost
 your


heart
 rate.
 Anything
 that
 boosts
 your


heart
 rate
 before
 bed
 is
 going to
 be
 bad


for
 you.
 Okay.
 Three
 is
 you
 want
 to
 have


uh
 amber
 and
 red
 lights
 in
 your
 house.


No
 blues
 like
 these
 are
 very
 blue.
 Uh


you
 want
 to
 have
 u
 be
 mindful
 of
 your


stimulants.
 So
 noon
 thereabouts
 is
 when


you
 want
 to
 stop
 your
 caffeine
 intake


because
 caffeine
 has
 roughly
 a
 6-hour


halflife.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee


at
 4
 p.m.
 at
 bedtime
 a
 half
 a
 cup
 of


coffee
 is
 in
 your
 system.
 And
 then


finally
 you
 want
 to
 have
 some
 kind
 of


windown
 routine
 where
 you
 read
 a
 book,


go
 for
 a
 walk,
 do
 breath
 work,
 meditate,


but
 something
 to
 calm
 yourself
 down.


Okay,
 now
 just
 be
 sober
 with
 me
 for
 a


minute.


I
 promise
 you


this
 is
 the
 single
 best
 thing
 you
 can
 do


for
 your
 health.
 And
 if
 we're
 honest,


the
 majority
 of
 you
 in
 this
 room
 have


some
 moderate
 to
 serious
 mental
 health


problem.


Tell
 me
 I'm
 wrong.


Waiting.
 It's
 true.
 Like
 you
 sample
 your


friends.
 Like
 it
 is
 a
 pretty
 tough


environment
 right
 now.
 We
 are
 on
 our


phones
 all
 the
 time.
 We
 don't
 sleep


well.
 We
 eat
 junk
 food.
 It's
 very
 hard


to
 take
 a
 moment
 to
 ourel
 to
 be
 healthy.


I
 promise
 you,
 optimize
 your
 resting


heart
 rate
 and
 it's
 going to
 be
 the
 very


best
 thing
 you
 do
 for
 your
 mood.
 If


you're
 experiencing
 anxiety
 or


depression
 or
 you're
 having
 some
 other


kind
 of
 difficulty,
 I'm
 telling
 you,


high
 quality
 sleep
 is
 the
 thing.
 And


culture
 that
 tells
 us
 right
 now
 that
 you


have
 to
 grind
 and
 not
 sleep
 is
 a
 lie.


It's
 a
 bad
 deal
 for
 you.
 You
 can
 be


ambitious.
 You
 can
 have
 unhinged


ideas
 about
 the
 world
 and
 still
 sleep.


Okay.
 So,
 I've
 got
 20
 seconds
 left.


Who's
 going
 to
 commit
 to
 this?


>> Yep.


Who's
 not?


So,
 I
 can
 shame
 you.
 Okay.
 Why?
 Why
 are


you
 not
 going
 to
 commit?


>> I'm
 a
 startup
 founder.


>> Okay.
 There
 we
 go.
 This
 is
 Okay.
 This
 is


it,
 you
 guys.
 Here's
 it.
 Yes,
 you're
 a


startup
 founder.
 Okay.
 The
 narrative
 is


you
 have
 to
 martyr
 yourself,
 literally


martyr
 yourself
 to
 achieve
 success.


That
 is
 not
 true.
 You
 will
 be
 a
 better


founder
 slashparent/partner


slash
 whatever
 if
 you
 prioritize
 your


sleep.
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 it
 is
 a
 false


idea.
 Don't
 fall
 for
 it.


Don't
 die.
 Yes,
 it's
 about
 health.
 It's


also
 the
 next
 major
 ideology
 for
 the


human
 race.
 We
 are
 giving
 birth
 to
 super


intelligence.


Our
 ideas
 about
 reality
 are
 going
 to


shift.
 Existence
 itself
 will
 be
 the


highest
 virtue.


Don't
 die
 is
 the
 next
 major
 ideology
 on


par
 with
 democracy,
 capitalism,


Christianity,
 Islam.
 It
 is
 the
 next


thing
 we
 do
 as
 a
 species.
 So
 friends,


be
 well.
 Go
 to
 bed
 on
 time.
 Am
 I
 seeing


this?
 You
 committed?
 All right,
 guys.
 Be


well.


[Music]
