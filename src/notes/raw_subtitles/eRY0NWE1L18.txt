[Music]


hi
 everybody
 our
 special
 guest
 today
 is


Andy
 Ransom
 the
 CEO
 of
 rill
 which
 is
 the


world
 largest
 Pest
 Control
 provider
 now


many
 people
 have
 uh
 memorable
 stories


about
 pest
 related
 stories
 whether
 it's


removing
 you
 know
 ants


rats
 uh
 alligators
 even
 from
 pools
 so
 um


Andy
 let's
 kick
 off
 what's
 kind
 of
 the


crazy
 story
 you


have
 oh
 my
 word
 well
 uh
 hi
 n
 thanks
 for


inviting
 me
 along
 um


look
 I
 mean
 we
 could
 probably
 spend
 the


next
 hour
 talking
 about
 crazy
 pest


control
 stories
 that's
 that's
 that's


what
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 that's
 what
 we're


going
 to
 do
 is
 okay
 well
 you
 know
 where


where
 to
 start
 I
 mean
 uh
 we
 were
 hired


by
 Libya
 to
 go
 and
 deal
 with
 Bubonic


plague
 that
 that
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 surprise


we
 uh
 we've
 done
 some
 work
 in
 Australia


with
 mouse
 plages
 where
 we
 had
 millions


millions
 of
 mice
 to
 deal
 with
 we've
 had


um
 monkeys
 in
 Singapore
 we've
 had
 camels


we've
 had
 to
 deal
 with
 in
 the
 middle


East
 I
 mean
 you
 name
 it
 snakes
 and


everything
 it's
 it's
 um
 it's
 a
 crazy


business
 in
 that
 sense
 say
 as
 you
 say


everyone's
 got
 a
 pest
 control
 story
 and


and
 um
 my
 wife
 always
 tells
 a
 pest


control
 story
 about
 me
 um
 when
 we
 were


living
 in
 in
 America
 and
 I
 was
 I
 was


doing
 the
 garden
 one
 day
 and
 I
 Disturbed


a
 a
 nest
 of
 yellow
 jackets
 or
 wasps
 as


we
 would
 call
 them
 and
 one
 of
 them
 stung


me
 and
 stung
 me
 in
 the
 neck
 and
 I
 ran


like
 a
 scared
 kid
 and
 I
 ran
 into
 the


house
 open
 the
 door
 I
 then
 closed
 the


door
 and
 I
 locked
 it
 and
 my
 wife
 was


saying
 what
 what
 on
 Earth
 are
 you
 doing


you
 know
 why
 have
 you
 closed
 the
 door


are
 you
 expecting
 them
 to
 come
 in


through
 the
 door
 you
 have
 they
 got
 a
 set


of
 keys
 but
 that's
 a
 sort
 of
 you
 know


panic
 and
 and
 uh
 reaction
 that
 pests


generate
 in
 people
 so
 it
 it
 is
 one
 of


those
 those
 subjects
 that
 as
 I
 say


everyone's
 got
 an
 experience
 everyone's


got
 a
 story
 but
 it
 is
 an
 amazing


industry
 what
 are
 the
 big
 drivers
 of


this
 uh
 industry
 well
 I
 think
 you
 know


somebody
 once
 described
 the
 business
 to


me
 as
 almost
 biblical
 you
 know
 the
 pests


have
 been
 with
 us
 since
 the
 beginning
 of


time
 and
 they
 will
 be
 with
 us
 till
 the


end
 of
 time
 and
 and
 that
 that
 is
 true


you
 know
 the
 pests
 will
 always
 be
 with


us
 right
 now
 certainly
 global
 warming


and
 an
 increasing
 temperature
 of
 the


planet
 there's
 no
 doubt
 that
 that
 is


having
 a
 bearing
 um
 that
 is
 altering
 the


breeding
 season
 of
 flying
 biting


crawling
 insects
 so
 if
 if
 it's
 hotter


you
 tend
 to
 see
 the
 the
 SE
 seon
 start


earlier
 and
 it
 goes
 a
 bit
 longer
 because


of
 the
 the
 temperature
 so
 that's
 one


thing
 um
 regulation
 legislation
 the


world
 is
 is
 increasing
 with
 uh
 its
 its


regulatory
 environment
 that's
 not


getting
 easier
 anywhere
 um
 Rising


standards
 I
 mean
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 used


to
 travel
 to
 uh
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 years


and
 years
 ago
 and
 I'd
 go
 out
 to
 dinner


and
 there'd
 be
 a
 cockroach
 would
 run


across
 the
 tablecloth
 and
 you'd
 just


flick
 it
 to
 the
 floor
 you
 wouldn't


accept
 that
 uh
 today
 in
 in
 a
 nice


restaurant
 so
 Rising
 it
 do
 it
 doesn't


look
 these
 rages
 they
 don't
 look
 so


good
 on
 social
 media
 do
 they
 they
 don't


look
 so
 good
 in
 social
 media
 and
 that's


a
 big
 part
 of
 you
 know
 why
 why
 do


companies
 uh
 hire
 us
 well
 they
 need
 uh


their
 health
 protected
 but
 they
 need


their
 reputation
 protected
 as
 well
 and


that
 that's
 a
 key
 part
 of
 what
 we're


doing
 particularly
 for
 the
 for
 the


businesses
 so
 you
 know
 you've
 got


regulation
 you've
 got
 climate
 you've
 got


increasing
 standards
 you've
 also
 got


Rising
 middle
 classes
 and
 in
 big
 chunks


of
 the
 world
 particularly
 uh
 in
 the


emerging
 markets
 you've
 got
 urbanization


the
 towns
 and
 the
 cities
 are
 getting


bigger
 and
 bigger
 uh
 and
 you've
 got


people
 with
 more
 and
 more
 money
 why
 are


bigger
 cities
 good
 for
 you
 well
 it's


because
 um
 you
 know
 if
 you
 take
 rats
 and


rodents
 for
 example
 they
 go
 where
 the


food
 is
 um
 and
 people
 go
 to
 the
 cities


uh
 the
 cities
 are
 typically
 not
 so
 clean


restaurants
 put
 the
 trash
 out
 the
 back


they
 they
 they
 leave
 it
 around
 uh
 and


rats
 in
 particular
 will
 find
 those


sources
 of
 Food
 they'll
 find
 places
 to


live
 so
 the
 bigger
 the
 cities
 the
 the


more
 urban
 they
 become
 the
 more
 likely


there
 there
 to
 be
 an
 attractive
 place


for
 rats
 to
 to
 come
 and
 move
 into
 so


that's
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 key
 reasons


that
 um
 urbanization
 has
 an
 impact
 quite


a
 big
 impact
 on
 growth
 in
 the
 pest


control
 industry
 I
 heard
 that
 in
 big


cities
 you're
 never
 more
 than
 two
 meters


from
 a


rat
 yeah
 I
 think
 that
 might
 be
 one
 of


those
 um
 might
 be
 one
 of
 those
 urban


urban
 myths
 and
 there's
 certainly
 um


some
 CI
 that
 you're
 probably
 never
 more


than
 a
 couple
 of
 feet
 from
 a
 rat
 but


honestly
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 take
 a
 city
 like


London
 city
 where
 I
 live
 um
 you've
 got


sewers
 under
 the
 city
 you've
 got
 a
 very


very
 old


infrastructure
 um
 you've
 got
 restaurants


and
 and
 waste
 outside
 for
 for
 rats
 to
 to


feed
 on
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 to
 look
 too


far
 to
 find
 rodent
 activity
 in
 in
 London


or
 New
 York
 or
 Paris
 but
 but
 whether


it's
 you
 know
 within
 a
 couple
 of
 meters


I
 think
 that
 might
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 stretch


could
 you
 spend
 a
 bit
 more
 time
 on
 the


climate
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 main


effects
 of
 climate
 on
 your


business
 well
 I
 suppose
 to
 two


Dimensions
 to
 that
 if
 if
 you
 think
 about


it
 the
 first
 one
 is
 is
 the
 one
 I've


touched
 on
 which
 is
 the


environment
 um
 for
 pests
 and
 pest


activity
 in
 a
 world
 where
 the
 planet
 is


warming
 uh
 and
 the
 seasons
 are
 more


unpredictable
 and
 and
 Summers
 tend
 to
 be


hotter
 and
 the
 winters
 tend
 to
 wetter


those
 are
 good
 um
 breeding
 conditions


for
 certain
 types
 of
 particularly
 the


insects
 the
 flying
 the
 biting
 the


crawling
 insects
 so
 that
 does
 have
 a


bearing
 on
 how
 soon
 in
 the
 season
 do
 we


see
 see
 activity
 and
 how
 long
 do
 those


Seasons
 go
 on
 for
 if
 you
 flip
 it
 round


to
 a
 more
 positive
 um
 social
 side
 of
 the


question
 in
 terms
 of


sustainability
 today
 most
 solutions
 for


Pest
 Control


still
 require
 some
 element
 of
 chemical


treatment
 and
 going
 forward
 that
 will


not
 be
 the
 case
 we
 we're
 increasingly


moving
 in
 a
 world
 of
 non-tox
 Sustainable


Solutions
 chemical-free


Solutions
 um
 ours
 is
 a
 business
 that
 has


a
 lot
 of
 people
 driving
 around
 burning


um
 carbon
 in
 their
 in
 their
 vehicles


we're
 making
 changes
 in
 that
 uh


Department
 as
 well
 so
 on
 the
 one
 side


yes
 it's
 probably
 quotes
 net
 good
 uh
 for


demand
 side
 of
 the
 industry
 on
 the
 other


side
 we're
 a
 very
 responsible
 uh
 player


very
 responsible
 company
 so
 like
 many


other
 companies
 we're
 looking
 to
 the


environment
 in
 which
 we
 operate
 say
 okay


how
 can
 we
 do
 what
 we
 do
 which
 is
 a


necessary
 service
 how
 can
 we
 do
 it
 in
 a


way
 that
 has
 much
 less
 of
 an
 impact
 on


the
 planet
 going
 forward
 the
 fact
 that


you
 uh
 cannot
 use
 as
 much
 chemicals
 as


you
 have
 done
 in
 the
 past
 does
 that
 make


your
 job
 more
 difficult
 yeah
 I
 it's
 a


good
 question
 it's
 a
 good
 question


because
 in
 in
 Europe
 um
 it's
 the
 first


part
 of
 the
 world
 where
 they
 put
 in


place
 a
 ban
 on
 permanent
 baiting
 so


historically
 what
 you
 would
 do
 a


customer
 your
 your
 hotel
 for
 example


that
 just
 called
 us
 in
 and
 we
 see
 okay


we
 can't
 see
 any
 evidence
 of
 of
 rodent


activity
 but
 to
 prevent
 them
 coming
 we


would
 put
 down
 poisons
 well
 the
 European


authorities
 say
 no
 no
 no
 no
 no
 you
 can't


do
 that
 going
 forward
 you
 can
 only
 put


down
 poisons
 once
 you
 have
 a
 problem


it's
 quite
 an
 interesting
 change
 so
 so


initially
 when
 the
 industry
 saw
 that


this
 was
 going
 back
 a
 few
 years
 the


industry
 said
 well
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this


is
 not
 good
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 rodent


problems
 everywhere
 because
 part
 of
 what


we
 do
 is
 a
 preventative
 the
 prevention


of
 the
 problem
 I
 think
 the
 reality
 is


with
 those
 rule
 changes
 as
 they've
 come


through
 it's
 forced
 companies
 like


ourselves
 to
 become
 more
 innovative
 so


we've
 come
 up
 with
 solutions
 that
 say


okay
 if
 we
 can't
 put
 down
 permanent


baiting
 and
 poison
 initially
 until


there's
 a
 problem
 what
 else
 can
 we
 do
 so


we've
 used
 Internet
 of
 Things
 connected


devices
 we've
 used
 technology


increasingly
 now
 we're
 using
 cameras
 um


to
 identify
 the
 problem
 once
 you
 see
 a


problem
 then
 you
 can
 put
 down
 the


chemical
 Solutions
 we're
 also
 trying
 to


come
 up
 with
 new
 Solutions
 which
 don't


use


chemicals
 at


all
 being
 a
 bit
 lame
 here
 but
 why
 why


can't
 you
 use
 uh
 permanent
 baiting
 well


there
 there's
 two
 things
 one
 is
 is
 you


know
 the
 European
 authorities
 and


increasingly
 California
 authorities


another
 one
 who
 who's
 looking
 at
 it
 um


they're
 trying
 to
 reduce
 the
 amount
 of


chemicals
 that
 we
 put
 into
 the
 planet


generally
 so
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


chemicals
 going
 into
 the
 planet
 and
 and


farm
 farms
 in
 particular
 use
 a
 huge


quantity
 of
 chemical
 bait
 so
 so
 that's


you
 know
 that
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 and


the
 second
 uh
 concern
 is
 one
 of


secondary
 poisoning
 so
 there
 is
 a


concern
 that
 uh
 if
 you
 put
 down
 um


chemical
 poisons
 to


indiscriminately
 not
 only
 will
 you
 kill


the
 rats
 and
 the
 mice
 but
 you
 could
 end


up
 damaging
 other
 Wildlife
 birds
 birds


of
 prey
 for
 example
 that
 might
 feed
 on


the
 uh
 feed
 on
 on
 the
 rodent
 so
 you
 know


it's
 it's
 well
 intended
 and
 it's
 in
 it's


um
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 oppose
 it
 but
 it


does
 require
 Innovation
 and
 innovative


solutions
 to
 come
 up
 with
 Alternatives


which
 they're
 coming
 but
 in
 some
 cases


they're
 not
 they're
 not
 there
 yet
 what


um
 kind
 of
 emerging
 pest
 threats
 are
 you


most
 concerned
 about
 now
 yeah
 I
 mean


like
 I
 said
 you
 know
 the
 the
 pest
 have


always
 been
 with
 us
 and
 probably
 always


will
 be
 I
 think
 I
 think
 they
 go
 in


phases
 certainly
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the


time
 of
 uh
 the
 Olympics
 in
 Brazil
 um


zika
 was
 a
 massive
 concern
 and
 zika
 is


is
 just
 one
 example
 of
 diseases
 which


are
 born
 and
 spread
 by
 mosquitoes
 so
 I


would
 say
 if
 you
 if
 you
 actually
 look


and
 and
 go
 back
 in
 time
 um
 malaria
 is


responsible
 for
 more
 deaths
 on
 the


planet
 since
 the
 beginning
 of
 time
 than


any
 other
 cause
 more
 than
 War
 more
 than


disease
 more
 than
 cancer
 um
 so
 things


like
 malaria
 right
 now
 Deni
 fever
 um
 is


is
 significantly
 on
 the
 increase
 in


markets
 like
 Brazil
 you
 see
 huge


increases
 in
 Deni
 fever
 so
 I
 think


Vector
 born
 diseases
 um
 remain
 a
 big


concern
 and
 they
 you
 know
 they
 very


serious
 consequences
 you
 can
 you
 know


you
 can
 end
 up
 um
 dying
 or
 being
 very


very
 sick
 from
 vectorn
 diseases
 um
 less


dramatic
 but
 certainly
 more
 topical
 at


the
 moment
 you've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 bed


buuck
 activity
 in
 the
 news
 of
 course
 we


got
 the
 Olympics
 um
 in
 in
 France
 in


Paris
 this
 year
 and
 last
 year
 in


particular
 there's
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


media
 coverage
 about
 the
 the
 surge
 in


bed
 bug
 activity
 is
 it
 real
 or
 is
 it


because
 people
 want
 to
 have
 a
 go
 at
 the


French
 oh
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 the
 second


but
 but
 um
 look
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 uh


yes
 it
 is
 real
 there
 there
 is
 real


significant
 um
 bed
 bug
 activity
 I
 think


there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 media
 um
 hype
 in


here
 as
 well
 I
 think
 we've
 had
 bed
 bugs


in
 the
 big
 cities
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 um


but
 but
 there's
 there's
 little
 doubt


certainly
 the
 the
 number
 of
 inquire


we've
 had
 from
 customers
 in
 the
 UK
 in


France
 and
 callouts
 to
 deal
 with
 bed


bugs
 is
 certainly
 significantly


increased
 so
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 difficult


to
 say
 is
 that
 because
 the
 bed
 bugs
 are


increasing
 or
 is
 it
 because
 of
 the


awareness
 of
 the
 problem
 it's
 a
 little


difficult
 to
 call
 that
 but
 you
 know
 that


that'd
 be
 another
 another
 good
 example


of
 of
 you
 know
 the
 increasing
 um


intolerance
 of
 people
 to
 to
 pest


activity
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 new


technologies
 that
 you
 using
 yeah
 and


look
 we
 are
 a
 really
 Innovative
 company


and
 and
 we
 think
 Innovation
 is
 really


the
 lifeblood
 of
 future
 growth
 and


Internet
 of
 Things
 connected
 devices


remote
 monitoring
 devices
 so
 these
 are


think
 of
 it
 like
 um
 a
 burglar
 alarm
 for


pests
 so
 you
 put
 down
 a
 a
 monitor
 and
 if


uh
 in
 this
 case
 a
 rat
 or
 a
 mouse


triggers
 the
 infrared
 beam
 we've
 got


activity
 we
 know
 there's
 activity


we
 can
 either
 send
 a
 message
 back
 to
 the


organization
 you've
 got
 rodent
 activity


and
 this
 is
 where
 it
 is
 or
 we
 can


actually
 deal
 with
 the
 problem
 uh
 and


kill
 the
 road
 in
 in
 situ
 so
 Internet
 of


Things
 connected
 devices
 remote


monitoring
 is
 the
 first
 wave
 of


innovation
 we
 we
 brought
 through
 uh


about
 18
 months
 ago
 we
 bought
 a
 a
 really


exciting
 tech-based
 business
 out
 of


Israel
 which
 is
 using
 the
 next


generation
 of
 technology
 which
 is


cameras
 camera
 based
 technology


micro
 cameras
 that
 are
 in
 situ
 so
 not


only
 can
 they
 see
 um
 the
 source
 of
 the


problem
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 problem
 the


extent
 and
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 problem
 but


they
 can
 actually
 identify
 using
 facial


recognition
 the
 identity
 of
 the
 Rat
 so


they
 cannot
 just
 say
 it's
 it's
 three


rats
 and
 this
 is
 the
 activity
 we've
 seen


they
 can
 say
 it's
 rat
 number
 12
 rat


number
 17
 and
 rat
 number
 24
 have
 come


through
 this
 camera
 um
 16
 times
 in
 the


last
 hour
 so
 you
 can
 actually
 track
 the


behavior
 and
 if
 you
 can
 start
 to
 track


behavior
 and
 you
 can
 mimic
 animal


behavior
 you're
 far
 more
 effective
 and


far
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 able
 to
 solve
 the


problem
 so
 I'd
 say
 camerab
 based


technology
 is
 is
 probably
 the
 next
 big


thing
 in
 um
 identification
 of
 rodent


problems
 and
 and
 insect
 problems
 well
 I


have
 to
 say
 knowing
 one
 rat
 from
 the


other
 uh
 it
 kind
 of
 uh
 takes
 it
 into
 a


new


level
 yeah
 it
 does
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 sit


there
 and
 say
 yeah
 but
 what's
 the
 point


I
 mean
 is
 it
 really
 that
 important
 that


you
 know
 it's
 rat
 number
 three
 and
 rat


number
 13
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 can
 do
 it


the
 fact
 that
 the
 technology
 can
 can
 do


that
 it
 does
 start
 to
 give
 us
 new
 new


insights
 Andy
 you
 are
 a
 really
 really


impressive
 uh
 deal
 maker
 and
 um
 you
 make


new
 deals
 pretty
 much
 every
 week
 uh


buying
 companies
 and
 and
 building
 rent


tole
 larger
 why
 why
 is
 this


important


yeah
 look
 I
 mean
 apart
 from
 the
 fact
 I


love
 doing
 deals
 and
 that's
 that's
 part


of
 my
 DNA
 um
 we
 do
 deals
 for
 I
 guess


three
 reasons
 um
 the
 first
 one
 is
 it


gives
 us
 density
 so
 as
 is
 as
 is
 a


network
 business
 so
 the
 way
 to
 think


about
 it
 if
 we've
 got
 I
 live
 in
 a
 little


town
 in
 Kent
 and
 and
 if
 we've
 got
 say
 10


customers
 in
 the
 High
 Street
 um
 we'll


make
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 money
 if
 we
 had


20
 customers
 in
 the
 High
 Street
 we'd


make
 a
 lot
 more
 money
 money
 and
 the


reason
 is
 we're
 not
 then
 spending
 all
 of


the
 time
 driving
 from
 one
 appointment
 to


the
 next
 and
 to
 the
 next
 if
 you
 can


minimize
 drive
 time
 windshield
 time


therefore
 you
 maximize
 the
 amount
 of


time
 that
 you're
 on
 customer
 site


providing
 value
 added
 work
 so
 that's
 the


first
 thing
 it's
 about
 density
 it's


about
 shortening
 uh
 drive
 time
 and


therefore
 it
 means
 instead
 of
 doing
 six


visits
 a
 day
 maybe
 a
 technician
 can


squeeze
 in
 another
 and
 do
 seven
 visits
 a


day
 that
 gives
 you
 a
 much
 uh
 much


greater
 gross
 margin
 so
 that's
 that's


the
 first
 reason
 we
 do
 deals
 and
 a
 lot


of
 our
 deals
 are
 are
 density
 deals
 um


the
 second
 we
 call
 it
 the
 cities
 of
 the


future
 and
 so
 if
 you
 look
 today
 I
 mean
 a


statistic
 I
 never
 get
 tired
 of
 quoting


is
 that


50%
 50%
 half
 of
 the
 world's
 Pest
 Control


takes
 place
 in
 the
 United
 States
 of


America
 the
 other
 half
 of
 the
 world's


Pest
 Control
 Tak
 takes
 place
 in
 all
 of


the
 other
 countries
 and
 cities
 and
 towns


added
 together
 it's
 a
 remarkable


statistic
 well
 if
 we
 fast
 forward
 50


years
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


5050
 the
 growth
 in
 the
 big
 cities
 and
 we


talked
 about
 the
 importance
 of
 of


urbanization
 but
 the
 growth
 in
 the
 big


cities
 particularly
 in
 China
 in
 India
 in


Brazil
 in
 Colombia
 there's
 there's
 a


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cities
 that
 in
 the
 next


10
 20
 30
 40
 50
 years
 the
 growth
 in
 those


cities
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 very


significant
 so
 our
 our
 strategic
 model


says
 hey
 look
 if
 we
 can
 identify
 the


cities
 of
 the
 future
 and
 we
 can
 get
 into


those
 cities
 now
 typically
 through


acquisition
 and
 then
 we
 can
 build
 the


density
 then
 in
 10
 20
 30
 40
 years
 we're


going
 to
 have
 a
 series
 of
 very
 very


dense
 very
 very
 profitable
 powerful


positions
 in
 the
 biggest
 cities
 in
 the


world
 so
 that's
 the
 second
 reason
 we
 do


deals
 is
 to
 try
 and
 pick
 those
 cities


build
 early
 buy
 the
 best
 pest
 control


business
 make
 it
 rent
 to
 kill
 the
 third


reason
 we
 do
 deals
 is
 is
 capability
 and


Technology
 I
 gave
 you
 an
 example
 a


minute
 ago
 we
 bought
 that
 business
 in


Israel
 sometimes
 we'll
 buy
 a
 company


where
 they've
 already
 got
 the
 technology


so
 th
 those
 are
 the
 three
 the
 three


reasons
 what's
 the
 secret
 to
 making
 a


good


deal
 uh
 well
 yeah
 that's
 a
 that's
 a


that's
 a
 big
 discussion
 as
 well
 isn't
 it


let's
 just
 start
 I
 think
 first


off
 strategic
 alignment
 you
 know
 I


always
 always
 say
 you
 know
 you
 should
 be


really
 really
 strategy
 is
 a
 big
 word
 but


you
 know
 are
 you
 really
 clear
 um
 where


you
 want
 to
 be
 which
 which
 markets
 you


want
 to
 be
 which
 Services
 you
 want
 to


offer
 which
 Industries
 you
 want
 to
 serve


are
 you
 clear
 how
 you
 want
 to
 grow
 um
 if


you've
 got
 a
 clear
 strategy
 and
 we've


talked
 about
 you
 know
 cities
 of
 the


future
 and
 we've
 talked
 about
 density


building
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 is


the
 potential
 acquisition
 on
 strategy
 or


is
 it
 yeah
 is
 it
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 stretch
 is


it
 a
 bit
 so
 that
 that's
 the
 first
 point


um
 second
 I'd
 say
 look
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a


retired
 lawyer
 I
 know
 I
 was
 an
 m&
 lawyer


as
 well
 and
 I
 would
 always
 say
 detail


detail
 detail
 you
 know
 this
 is
 this
 is


uh
 so
 critical
 that
 you
 do
 your
 due


diligence
 you
 do
 your
 preparation
 you
 do


your
 planning
 and
 it's
 thorough
 and
 you


don't
 get
 seduced
 by
 the
 process
 a
 lot


of
 people
 get
 halfway
 in
 oh
 yeah
 we


found
 a
 problem
 that's
 all
 right
 we'll


deal
 with
 it
 no
 no
 now
 you've
 got
 to
 be


really
 disciplined
 and
 and
 be
 prepared


to
 walk
 away
 if
 what
 you
 find
 is
 is
 not


uh
 acceptable
 to
 you
 I
 do
 think
 Forward


Thinking
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 negotiation
 um
 I


always
 encourage
 my
 team
 to
 think
 like


chess
 players
 try
 and
 think
 three
 steps


ahead
 try
 and
 anticipate
 um
 the


evolution
 of
 a
 negotiation
 what's
 likely


to
 happen
 and
 to
 and
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


that
 you've
 really
 got
 to
 understand


well
 what
 does
 the
 other
 side
 want
 to


get
 out
 of
 this
 deal
 as
 well
 and
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 a
 critical
 part
 if
 you


want
 a
 successful
 negotiation
 too
 many


people
 just
 work
 on
 well
 what
 do
 I
 want


what
 do
 I
 need
 what
 am
 I
 prepared
 to
 pay


you
 got
 to
 work
 out
 what
 the
 other
 side


of
 the
 table
 is
 looking
 for
 are
 they


looking
 for
 maximum
 price
 is
 it


certainty
 is
 it
 speed
 is
 it
 what
 are


they
 what
 what's
 important
 to
 them
 let's


assume
 now
 so
 so
 now
 I
 assume
 I
 have


Nicola
 tang
 and
 pest
 control
 company


limited
 yeah
 and
 um
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 me


now
 what
 is
 your
 best
 negotiation


trick
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 tricks
 I


don't
 know
 about
 tricks
 Nikolai
 I
 mean
 I


I
 I
 I
 used
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 aggressive


negotiator
 when
 I
 first
 started
 out
 um


and
 this
 and
 I
 I
 learned
 some
 pretty
 um


as
 I
 say
 aggressive
 approaches
 and
 I
 was


you
 know
 I
 was
 quite
 a
 table
 Banger
 um


are
 you
 are
 you
 have
 you
 become
 softer


with
 age
 yeah
 I've
 become
 I'm
 mellowed


and
 I'm
 chilled
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 pussycat


now
 so
 I'm
 much
 easier
 to
 deal
 with
 but


I
 actually
 figured
 out
 along
 the
 way


that
 being
 hard
 and
 tough
 and
 shouty


isn't
 necessarily
 the
 best
 approach
 to


getting
 the
 best
 out
 of
 out
 of
 a
 out
 of


a
 negotiation
 what
 I
 would
 say
 in
 the


way
 I
 do
 it
 I
 I
 won't
 pretend
 I'm
 the


world's
 expert
 um
 I
 always
 say
 don't


treat
 everyone
 the
 same
 don't
 don't


assume
 that
 Nikolai
 is
 going
 to
 behave


in
 this
 way
 or
 that
 way
 and
 don't
 make


you
 know
 assumptions
 that
 he's
 Norwegian


so
 he'll
 think
 like
 this
 or
 he's
 you


know
 50
 whatever
 and
 he'll
 think
 like


don't
 make
 assumptions
 about
 who
 you're


dealing
 with
 understand
 them
 get
 to
 know


them
 and
 then
 flex
 your
 negotiating


style
 according
 to
 who
 you're
 dealing


with
 and
 and
 some
 people
 respond


differently
 to
 different
 styles
 and


techniques
 but
 I
 I
 said
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 a
 trick
 but
 but
 my
 view
 is
 if


you're
 more
 prepared
 if
 you're
 more


thorough
 if
 you're
 more
 detail
 oriented


than
 the
 person
 that
 is
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 table
 you
 should
 get
 the


better
 of
 the
 negotiation
 you
 don't
 have


to
 be
 difficult
 and
 shouty
 to
 do
 it
 um


you
 just
 got
 to
 be
 prepared
 to
 to
 uh
 you


know
 work
 at
 it
 I'd
 also
 say
 negotiating


tricks
 or
 not
 be
 prepared
 to
 walk
 away


you
 know
 the
 somebody
 once
 told
 me
 the


best
 deal
 that
 you
 can
 do
 is
 to
 avoid
 a


bad
 deal
 you
 know
 never
 be
 afraid
 to


walk
 away
 even
 at
 late
 stage
 if
 the


deal's
 not
 the
 right
 deal
 walk
 away
 so
 I


think
 um
 you
 know
 those
 are
 important


things
 I
 don't
 think
 they're
 necessarily


tricks
 of
 the
 trade
 but
 uh
 um
 they


they've
 sort
 of
 held
 me
 in
 pretty
 good


stad
 and
 now
 you
 have
 bought
 me
 what's


the
 key
 to
 integrating
 my
 company
 in
 the


best
 possible
 way
 into
 racill
 I
 I
 would


say
 the
 first
 thing
 and
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 people
 and
 in
 in
 a


business
 services
 it's
 it's
 all
 about


people
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 got
 to
 make


make
 sure
 is
 before
 we
 even
 buy
 your


business
 going
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 there


is
 cultural
 alignment
 how's
 it
 going
 to


work
 are
 you
 are
 we
 all
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 play
 nicely
 together
 are
 we
 going
 to


respect
 each
 other
 are
 we
 going
 to


listen
 to
 each
 other
 we're
 going
 to


learn
 from
 each
 other
 uh
 or
 are
 you


going
 to
 feel
 bent
 out
 of
 shape
 and
 your


people
 are
 going
 to
 feel
 like
 they
 lost


because
 they've
 been
 sold
 or
 are
 we


going
 to
 behave
 inappropriately
 because


we
 quotes
 one
 so
 the
 first
 for
 me
 is
 no


no
 no
 you've
 got
 to
 get
 cultural


alignment
 You'
 got
 to
 get
 people
 feeling


really
 really
 good
 that
 this
 is
 a
 great


thing
 then
 the
 second
 bit
 is
 really
 all


about
 execution
 and
 and
 I
 learned
 that


years
 ago
 that
 you
 know
 execution
 counts


way
 more
 than
 strategy
 I
 think
 those
 are


those
 are
 absolutely
 key
 and
 all
 of
 the


time
 keeping
 one
 very
 very
 fixed
 eye
 on


the
 people
 side
 and
 the
 culture
 so
 th


those
 would
 be
 the
 things
 I
 guess
 we'd


focus
 on
 I'd
 focus
 on
 you
 mentioned
 the


importance
 of
 um
 of
 uh
 people
 here
 and


this
 is
 an
 industry
 where
 there's
 quite


a
 bit
 of
 uh
 turnover
 in
 uh
 amongst
 the


people
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 retain


them
 yeah
 look
 I
 I
 I
 said
 um
 a
 minute


ago
 for
 me
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important


part
 of
 a
 business
 services
 business
 is


is
 about
 people
 I'd
 say
 like
 the
 I've


been
 CEO
 over
 10
 years
 now
 Ren
 been


privileged
 to
 have
 that
 that
 role
 the


first
 five
 years
 I
 think
 I
 focused
 on
 uh


process
 I
 focused
 on
 cost
 I
 focused
 on


structure
 I
 focused
 on
 uh
 innovation
 of


getting
 out
 of
 bad
 businesses
 focused
 on


acquisition
 the
 second
 five
 years
 of
 my


ten
 year
 I've
 really
 focused
 on
 people


and
 I
 think
 I
 was
 a
 bit
 late
 to
 to
 wake


up
 to
 this
 one
 what
 made
 you
 wake


up
 um
 oh
 quite
 honestly
 I
 was
 I
 was


chatting
 to
 one
 of
 my
 guys
 um
 and
 you


know
 we
 were
 doing
 well
 and
 we
 were


making
 great
 progress
 and
 we
 had
 this


conversation
 and
 I
 get
 a
 very
 open


relationship
 with
 my
 team
 and
 and
 um
 he


was
 giving
 me
 some
 feedback
 and
 um
 he


said
 look
 Andy
 he
 said
 you
 know
 you're


pretty
 good
 you
 know
 you're
 not
 bad


you're
 doing
 all
 right
 we're
 doing
 all


right
 he
 said
 but
 can
 I
 give
 you
 some


advice
 I
 yeah
 of
 course
 he
 said
 well
 he


said
 you
 play
 not
 to
 lose
 you
 you
 play


it
 safe
 you
 play
 with
 inside
 yourself


and
 and
 that's
 right
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 fear
 of


failure
 guy
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 screw
 up


okay
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 mess
 up
 and
 that's


that's
 been
 my
 you
 know
 that's
 that's


deep
 in
 my
 DNA
 and
 his
 advice
 he
 said


you
 know
 you
 should
 start
 playing
 to
 win


and
 and
 stop
 playing
 not
 to
 lose
 which
 I


thought
 was
 amazing
 advice
 considering


this
 guy
 worked
 for
 me
 and
 it
 and
 it


really
 resonated
 with
 me
 okay
 that
 is


right
 actually
 you
 know
 that
 that
 we're


doing
 well
 and
 we're
 making
 Pro
 we
 need


to
 start
 playing
 we
 need
 to
 start
 making


some
 more
 bold
 strokes
 and
 it
 was
 about


that
 time
 that
 it
 occurred
 to
 me
 and


looking
 at
 all
 of
 about
 numbers
 that
 the


single
 biggest
 in
 abler
 of
 success
 in
 my


business
 as
 people
 and
 your
 point
 about


you
 know
 retention
 and


churn
 um
 I
 said
 if
 only
 we
 could
 drive


up
 colleague


retention
 um
 then
 great
 things
 happen


colleague
 retention
 goes
 up
 if
 you
 got


happy
 engaged
 well-trained
 safe


colleagues
 who
 come
 to
 work
 every
 day


and
 do
 a
 great
 job
 for
 their
 customers


then
 we
 get
 happy
 engaged
 customers
 who


want
 to
 buy
 more
 stuff
 from
 us
 who
 are


interested
 in
 our
 story
 our
 Innovation


they'll
 pay
 our
 bills
 they'll
 give
 us


cash
 and
 we
 reinvest
 that
 cash
 you
 got


and
 you
 got
 50,000
 people
 you
 need
 to


get
 out
 of
 bed
 every
 day
 right
 yeah
 6
 60


now
 60,000
 and
 how
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you


get
 them
 out
 of
 bed
 and
 how
 do
 you
 get


them
 to
 come
 and
 be
 proud
 of
 what
 they


do
 and
 and
 how
 do
 you
 motivate
 them
 I


have
 to
 start
 very
 early
 and
 make
 a
 lot


of
 phone
 calls
 yeah
 um
 look
 I
 think
 you


know
 it
 is
 incredibly
 important
 um
 that


whole
 cultural
 bit
 and
 I
 do
 take
 it
 very


very


seriously
 first
 off
 it's
 genuine
 and
 in


our
 company
 you
 know
 people
 say
 what's


it
 like
 at
 rent
 gu
 I
 said
 you
 know
 what


it's
 a
 really
 nice
 company
 so
 it
 starts


with
 this
 Bedrock
 that
 we
 do
 actually


care
 about
 our
 people
 we
 do
 want
 them
 to


thrive
 we
 do
 care
 about
 their
 safety
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example
 um
 we
 put


safety
 uh
 at
 the
 number
 one
 agenda
 item


for
 every
 single
 meeting
 in
 the
 company


without
 exception
 every
 single
 meeting


starts
 with
 say


and
 in
 the
 last
 well
 because
 for
 me
 on
 a


personal
 level
 as
 a
 leader
 it's


incredibly
 important
 I've
 got
 a


background
 I
 used
 to
 work
 in
 explosives


and
 my
 previous
 business
 um
 I
 had
 some


fatalities
 on
 my
 watch
 um
 that
 still


affect
 me
 today
 and
 I
 said
 NE
 you
 never


again
 so
 in
 a
 people-based
 business
 in
 a


root-based
 business
 with
 thousands
 of


people
 driving
 working
 at
 height
 um


being
 exposed
 to
 chemicals
 I've
 said
 the


single
 most
 important
 thing
 in
 this


business
 is
 our
 people
 are
 safe
 and


everyone
 is
 authorized
 to
 walk
 off
 the


job
 if
 you
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 safe
 walk


off
 the
 job
 no
 one's
 ever
 going
 to


criticize
 you
 so
 we
 put
 that
 agenda
 item


number
 one
 10
 years
 ago
 changing
 um
 tax


here
 um
 what
 makes
 you
 an
 effective


leader
 well
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 ask


others
 as
 to
 whether
 I
 am
 an
 effective


leader
 I
 suppose
 um
 I
 think
 look
 I'm
 not


I
 I'm
 not
 a
 big
 uh
 quoter
 of
 of
 um
 sort


of
 business
 books
 but
 I
 do
 remember


reading
 uh
 Jack
 Welsh
 years
 and
 years


ago
 when
 I
 went
 to
 business
 school
 and


he
 said
 something


like
 um
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 uh
 an


effective
 business
 leader
 you
 should


surround
 yourself
 with
 people
 who
 are


better
 than
 you
 and
 then
 get
 out
 of
 the


way
 and
 let
 them
 do
 their
 job
 and
 to
 a


pretty
 large


degree
 that's
 what
 I've
 always
 tried
 to


do
 now
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 to
 say
 I'm
 not


an
 interventionist
 manager
 the
 legal


training
 that
 I've
 had
 means
 I
 do
 detail


I'm
 not
 a
 micromanager
 but
 I
 do
 detail


like
 nobody
 else
 in
 the
 company
 does


detail
 so
 but
 but
 my
 notion
 is
 why
 would


I
 try
 to
 be
 the
 best
 at
 marketing
 why


would
 I
 try
 to
 be
 the
 best
 at
 sales
 or


innovation
 or
 it
 or
 Finance
 I
 need


worldclass
 people
 surrounding
 me
 I
 need


to
 empower
 them
 and
 engage
 them
 and
 then


I
 need
 to
 hold
 them
 to
 account
 so
 for
 me


how
 can
 you
 do
 how
 can
 you
 do
 detail


without
 being
 a
 micromanager
 yeah
 well


well
 you
 can
 do
 detail
 I
 you
 know
 the


question
 was
 about
 efficiency
 and
 I
 am
 a


very
 very
 efficient
 um
 uh
 processor
 of


materials
 I
 I
 I
 can
 read
 a
 document


incredibly
 quickly
 and
 I
 can
 pick
 what
 I


think
 are
 the
 the
 kernels
 that
 I
 need
 to


get
 out
 of
 it
 but
 what
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


do
 is
 say
 okay
 I've
 read
 your
 report
 now


do
 this
 now
 do
 that
 turn
 left
 turn
 right


don't
 do
 that
 I've
 read
 the
 report
 I've


got
 the
 key
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 a


bunch
 of
 questions
 so
 my
 method
 of
 of


management
 is
 not
 to
 tell
 you
 what
 to
 do


now
 Nikolai
 my
 method
 of
 management
 is


say
 okay
 I've
 listened
 to
 what
 you
 said


here's
 a
 bunch
 of
 questions
 have
 you


thought
 about
 this
 that
 combined
 with


holding
 people
 to
 account
 in
 in
 Brent


isue
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 freedom
 you
 get
 a


lot
 of
 entrepreneurial
 Freedom
 if
 you


don't
 deliver
 you
 will
 be
 held
 to


account
 that
 that's
 that's
 my
 method


whether
 that
 makes
 me
 effective
 or


efficient
 others
 can
 judge
 how
 do
 I
 get


to
 the
 top
 of


rill
 yeah
 um
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 you


have
 to
 move
 me
 out
 F
 first
 I
 guess
 um


look
 I
 I
 think
 I
 look
 at
 my
 team
 I
 had


my
 team
 together
 on


Monday
 we've
 got
 huge
 tenure
 and


longevity
 in
 my
 senior
 team
 and
 I
 think


that
 is
 a
 tremendous
 compliment
 to
 the


organization
 when
 you
 say
 long
 what
 do


you
 mean
 by
 long
 what's
 a
 long


tenure
 uh
 well
 my
 head
 of
 it
 has
 been


doing
 it
 32
 years
 and
 I
 would
 I
 would


rate
 him
 as
 one
 of
 the
 best
 it


professionals
 I've
 ever
 worked
 with
 um
 I


didn't
 I
 didn't
 think
 we
 had
 computers


32
 years
 ago
 well
 I
 know
 it
 makes
 you


wonder
 you
 know
 but
 but
 he's
 still
 up
 to


speed
 with
 with
 AI
 and
 and
 Robotics
 and


all
 the
 rest
 of
 it
 I've
 been
 here
 15


years
 uh
 the
 finance
 director's
 been


here
 15
 years
 the
 head
 of
 UK's
 been
 here


15
 years
 the
 head
 of
 Europe's
 been
 here


14
 years
 so
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 longevity


now
 you
 could
 look
 at
 that
 and
 say
 well


maybe
 that's
 too
 much
 maybe
 where's
 the


where's
 the
 new
 blood
 where's
 well
 we


have
 some
 new
 blood
 as
 well
 but
 I
 think


people
 don't
 stay
 that
 length
 of
 time
 in


an
 organization
 if
 certain
 good
 things


AR
 aren't
 happening
 so
 for
 me
 comes
 back


to
 something
 we
 touched
 on
 earlier


culture
 is
 so
 so
 important
 and
 we
 have


fun
 working
 at
 r
 we
 really
 do
 we
 enjoy


each
 other's
 company
 we're
 high
 energy


we're
 nice
 but
 we
 are
 very
 hard
 agged


and
 I
 will
 say
 to
 the
 guys
 don't
 don't


confuse
 neness
 with
 softness
 we're
 not


not
 a
 soft
 organization
 we're
 a
 very


hard-edged
 business
 driven


performance-driven
 so
 I
 think
 how
 do
 you


get
 to
 the
 top
 you
 know
 hard
 work


application
 I
 would
 say
 be
 prepared
 to


move
 you
 know
 be
 prepared
 to
 move
 roles


be
 prepared
 to
 move
 countries
 be


prepared
 to
 move
 cross
 divisions
 so
 keep


learning
 and
 and
 um
 don't
 just
 stick
 in


that
 one
 tram
 line
 for
 your
 entire


career
 how
 hard
 do
 you


work
 um
 my
 wife
 would
 tell
 you


ridiculously
 hard
 um
 uh
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 things
 I've
 noticed
 over
 my
 career


and
 technology
 is
 really
 part
 of
 this


and
 I'm
 sure
 you're
 the
 same
 and
 many


people
 listening
 would
 be
 the
 same
 I


think
 the
 way
 in
 which
 we
 work
 is


radically
 different
 now
 so
 I
 I'm
 I
 kind


of
 I'm
 always
 on
 the
 the
 phone
 is
 always


on
 um
 I
 run
 a
 global
 business
 so
 I'm


getting
 emails
 and


messages
 kind
 of
 247
 you
 know
 and
 and
 as


I'm
 as
 I'm
 going
 to
 bed
 America's
 still


firing
 and
 as
 I'm
 getting
 up
 at
 the


morning
 Australia
 is
 not
 even
 yet
 you


know
 back
 at
 the
 afternoon
 and
 and
 the


way
 I
 cope
 with
 that
 is
 I
 I
 back
 to


efficiency
 I
 just
 deal
 with
 the
 stuff


when
 it
 comes
 in
 and
 that
 I
 think
 is
 you


know
 that
 makes
 huge


impositions
 on
 your
 lifestyle
 it
 means


you
 know
 you're
 constantly
 on
 um
 and


unfortunately
 for
 me
 that
 means
 if
 I
 go


on
 holiday
 I'm
 still
 on
 um
 I'm
 very
 bad


at
 at
 downtime
 it
 means
 that
 we
 weekends


I'm
 still
 on
 but
 for
 me
 I
 found
 a
 way
 of


making
 that
 work
 and
 sort
 of
 splitting


my
 brain
 a
 little
 bit
 so
 I
 can
 get
 on


and
 do
 the
 work
 stuff
 uh
 and
 still
 do


all
 the
 other
 things
 I
 want
 to
 do
 um
 you


know
 dayto
 day
 and
 in
 my
 life
 so
 I
 do


resent
 it
 from
 time
 to
 time
 because
 it


is
 a
 huge
 a
 huge
 imposition
 but
 it's


also
 an
 amazing
 job
 I
 think
 being
 a
 CEO


of
 any
 company
 is
 such
 a
 a
 privilege
 and


such
 a
 an
 excit
 exciting
 job
 and
 such
 a


varied
 job
 um
 so
 I
 feel
 you
 know
 I
 feel


it's
 not
 right
 for
 me
 to
 point
 out
 yeah


it's
 it's
 bloody
 hard
 work
 and
 and
 I


work
 very
 very
 hard
 but
 you
 know
 how
 do


you


relax
 yeah


um
 I
 I
 to
 I
 do
 a
 ton
 of
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 dry


January
 at
 the
 moment
 so
 I
 won't
 say


alcohol
 and
 that
 that
 wouldn't
 be
 the


politically
 correct
 answer
 but
 I
 enjoy


going
 out
 with
 family
 in
 particular
 I


enjoy
 going
 out
 with
 friends
 I'm
 a


massive
 sport
 night
 I'm
 a
 huge
 Chelsea


football
 fan
 um
 I'm
 I
 have
 a
 house
 in


Portugal
 and
 I
 love
 going
 out
 and


spending
 time
 in
 the
 sun
 um
 you
 know
 I


play
 some
 sport
 um
 but
 it's
 that
 sort
 of


stuff
 it's
 it's
 family
 it's
 socializing


it's
 sport
 um
 I'm
 not
 a
 I'm
 not
 an
 Avid


Reader
 I
 find
 my
 my
 brain
 is
 already


full
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 because
 I've


spent
 so
 much
 time
 reading
 stuff
 um
 I


enjoy
 watching
 various
 you
 know
 things


on
 TV
 and
 films
 I
 I
 got
 a
 busy
 life


don't
 get
 me
 wrong
 I'm
 my
 my
 my
 life


crams
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 um
 so
 yeah
 I
 do


find
 time
 to
 relax
 but
 but
 for
 me
 my


special
 place
 is
 is
 Portugal
 and
 the


algar
 that's
 that's
 where
 I
 feel
 I'm
 in


a
 I'm
 in
 a
 different
 place
 that's
 if
 I


can
 relax
 anywhere
 it's
 in
 the
 sunshine


in
 Portugal
 favorite
 Portuguese


dish
 ah
 frango
 P
 peri
 chicken
 Peri
 P
 hot


spicy


chicken
 sounds
 like
 a
 plan
 um
 Andy


finally
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people
 yeah
 that's
 another
 big
 question


an
 important
 question
 um
 one
 bit
 of


advice
 that
 I
 give
 when
 I
 talk


internally
 into
 my
 uh
 colleagues


here
 um
 I
 will


say
 when
 the
 hits
 the
 fan
 you
 got
 a


choice
 you
 can
 either
 take
 a
 step
 back


avoid
 it
 or
 you
 can
 take
 a
 step
 forward


and
 move
 towards
 it
 and
 what
 I
 mean
 by


that
 is
 throughout
 our
 lives
 through


throughout
 our
 careers
 in
 particular


throughout
 our
 jobs
 there'll
 be
 many


times
 where
 there's
 a
 situation
 that


looks
 a
 bit
 messy
 that
 looks
 a
 bit


complex
 that
 looks
 a
 bit


scary
 and
 my
 advice
 is
 when
 you
 see


those
 grasp
 them
 go
 towards
 them
 take


that
 opportunity
 it
 will
 make
 your


career
 more
 interesting
 It
 won't
 always


work
 out
 perfectly
 but
 I
 think
 if
 your


first
 instinct
 is
 to
 shy
 away
 from
 the


complex
 the
 messy
 the
 difficult
 the


challenge
 ing
 you
 never
 get
 to
 find
 out


what
 the
 alternative
 is
 and
 and
 you
 know


back
 to
 how
 do
 you
 get
 to
 the
 top
 most


CEOs
 will
 tell
 you
 and
 I'm
 sure
 you'll


be
 the
 same
 is
 we've
 all
 got
 the
 scars


to
 show
 for
 the
 things
 we
 didn't
 get


right
 the
 mistakes
 that
 we
 made
 the


things
 that
 we
 screwed
 up
 the
 things


that
 didn't
 go
 quite
 as
 well
 and
 I
 I
 do


think
 I
 do
 encourage
 that
 bravery
 if
 you


like
 and
 and


experimentation
 uh
 for
 younger
 people
 go


and
 have
 some
 fun
 with
 it
 what's
 the


worst
 that
 can
 happen
 sort
 of
 thing
 so
 I


think
 combination
 of
 having
 a
 plan
 and


executing
 that
 plan
 and
 talking
 and


asking
 for
 help
 but
 also
 that
 bit
 of
 bit


of
 bravery
 and
 if
 if
 the
 hits
 the


fan
 well
 don't
 worry
 about
 it
 Go
 and


deal
 with
 it
 and
 and
 get
 stuck
 in
 um


I've
 I've
 always
 felt
 that's
 that's


Sound
 Advice
 um
 I
 I've
 certainly
 um
 got


a
 lot
 out
 of
 it
 over
 the
 years
 in
 my


career
 yeah
 well
 Andre

 for
 sure

taken
 a
 little
 opportunities

 um
