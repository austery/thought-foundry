[Music]


welcome
 to
 in
 Good
 Company
 I'm
 Nikola


tangan
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 subone


wealth
 fund
 now
 today
 I'm
 joined
 by


David
 schrimmer
 the
 CEO
 of
 eleg
 which


contains
 the
 London
 Stock
 Exchange
 now


this
 company
 has
 been
 at
 the
 Forefront


of
 financial
 markets
 for
 centuries
 it's


now
 a
 global
 Powerhouse
 David
 is
 a
 New


Yorker
 with
 a
 really
 interesting


background
 and
 we'll
 explore
 some
 of


that
 uh
 but
 uh
 David
 I'm
 so
 happy
 that
 I


managed
 to
 convince
 you
 to
 come
 on
 when


we
 l
 at
 dinner
 in
 London
 Nikolai
 it's
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 thanks
 for
 having
 me


now
 eleg
 contains
 lond
 on
 Stock
 Exchange


but
 it
 also
 does
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 things


so
 what
 what
 does
 the
 company
 actually


do
 let's
 kick
 off
 with
 the
 basics
 so
 we


are
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 or
 I'll
 say
 the


world's
 leading
 financial
 markets


infrastructure
 and
 data
 provider
 we
 uh


have
 a
 number
 of
 different
 businesses


that
 serve
 customers
 buy
 side
 sell-side


financial
 institutions
 and
 corporates


governments
 across
 the
 trade
 life
 cycle


across
 the
 value
 chain
 so
 just
 in
 terms


of
 the
 specific
 businesses
 that
 we
 are


in
 we
 have
 uh
 data
 and
 analytics
 we're


the
 number
 one
 provider
 in
 the
 world
 of


for
 example
 real-time
 financial
 data
 uh


we
 have
 an
 index
 business
 footy
 Russell


uh
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 leading


uh
 index
 businesses
 we
 have
 a
 risk


intelligence
 business
 which
 provides
 the


leading
 content
 set
 for
 what
 banks
 use


for
 background
 checks
 and
 kyc
 uh
 AML
 you


put
 all
 those
 businesses
 together
 that's


our
 our
 uh
 data
 and
 analytics
 offering


that's
 roughly
 70%
 of
 our
 Revenue
 we


have
 uh
 Capital
 markets
 execution
 venues


across
 multiple
 asset
 classes
 so
 you


touched
 on
 the
 London
 Stock
 Exchange
 uh


a
 leading
 execution
 venue
 and
 equities


uh
 we
 have
 FX
 execution
 venues
 both


dealer
 to
 customer
 and
 dealer
 to
 dealer


uh
 in
 foreign
 exchange
 and
 then
 we
 also


are
 the
 controlling
 shareholder
 of
 trade


web
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 leading


electronic
 execution
 venues
 for
 fixed


income
 so
 what
 are
 the
 big
 macro
 trends


that
 drive
 your


business
 so
 the
 uh
 inflation


uh
 situation
 that
 we've
 had
 over
 the


last
 several
 years
 moves
 in
 interest


rates
 all
 those
 kinds
 of
 uh
 Dynamics


have
 an
 impact
 on
 our
 business
 generally


to
 the
 positive
 side
 in
 other
 words


volatility
 tends
 to
 be
 fairly
 good
 for


our
 business
 so
 we
 have
 this
 Foundation


of
 um
 70%
 of
 our
 Revenue
 very
 uh
 stable


and
 growing
 and
 then
 we
 get
 incremental


upside
 when
 there
 is
 volatility
 in
 the


markets
 but
 uh
 if
 you
 take
 a
 step
 back


from
 that
 and
 uh
 get
 your
 question
 on


the
 the
 different
 Trends
 uh
 data
 and


demand
 for
 data
 uh
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of


discussion
 about
 AI
 these
 days
 and
 how


does
 that
 play
 into
 what
 we're
 doing
 uh


the
 quality
 of
 for
 example
 large


language
 models
 is
 only
 uh
 is
 entirely


uh
 dependent
 on
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 data


that
 goes
 into
 them
 uh
 and
 so
 there's


more
 and
 more
 focus
 on
 data
 quality
 uh


and
 given
 what
 we
 do
 given
 our
 focus
 on


data
 Integrity
 data
 lineage
 data
 a


auditability
 uh
 that's
 proving
 to
 be
 a


big
 driver
 uh
 for
 us
 as
 well
 I
 think
 uh


some
 of
 the
 geopolitical
 Dynamics
 also


uh
 they
 tend
 to
 lead
 to
 uh
 more


volatility
 and
 they
 tend
 to
 also
 lead
 to


more
 demand
 for
 data
 as
 people
 are


trying
 to
 navigate
 the
 global
 situation


we
 are
 seeing
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 trend
 U
 when
 it


comes
 to
 UK
 companies
 moving
 to
 the
 US


why
 why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is
 well
 there


is
 a
 uh
 there's
 a
 stronger
 narrative


around
 that
 than
 the
 facts
 would


actually
 suggest
 yeah
 and
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 recognize
 that
 but
 having


said
 that
 we
 have
 seen
 a
 few
 U
 moving
 to


the
 US
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 things
 uh


driving
 that
 um
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 little


bit
 different
 in
 each
 case
 in
 uh
 one
 or


two
 cases
 it's
 been
 because
 of
 a
 sense


of
 uh
 most
 of
 the
 market
 being
 in
 the
 US


for
 certain
 companies
 uh
 in
 some
 cases


it
 has
 been
 people
 don't
 like
 to
 talk


about
 this
 too
 much
 but
 in
 some
 cases


it's
 been
 because
 of
 uh
 compensation


standards
 in
 the
 US
 so
 easier
 to
 pay


easier
 to
 pay
 higher
 salaries
 yes
 the


salaries
 for
 executives
 in
 the
 US
 tend


to
 be
 uh
 in
 some
 cases
 a
 multiple
 of


what
 they
 are
 uh
 in
 the
 UK
 so
 if
 you're


a
 fintech
 or
 biotech
 company
 that's
 come


out
 of
 one
 of
 the
 great
 universities
 in


the
 UK
 and
 you
 can
 uh
 list
 in
 London
 um


or
 you
 can
 list
 in
 New
 York
 and
 you
 list


in
 New
 York
 you
 might
 get
 paid
 three
 or


four
 times
 more
 um
 than
 you
 get
 paid
 in


London
 and
 in
 London
 you
 might
 be


criticized
 for
 it
 because
 of
 some
 of
 the


cultural
 elements
 here
 which
 we
 should


probably
 talk
 about
 that
 can
 create
 a
 a


dynamic
 where
 people
 are
 um
 more


attracted
 to
 the
 US
 environment
 there


are
 a
 number
 of
 factors
 uh
 and
 I
 think


that
 this
 the
 pendulum
 will
 swing
 there


are
 number
 of
 factors
 that
 make
 the
 UK


frankly
 a
 much
 more
 attractive
 listing


venue
 uh
 but
 there
 is
 a
 I'll
 call
 it
 a


cultural
 discussion
 going
 on
 right
 now


in
 the
 UK
 about
 this
 particular
 issue


from
 y
 Point
 how
 have
 you
 seen
 the
 the


backlash
 against
 ESG


considerations
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the


underlying
 Trends
 or
 changes
 that
 are


included
 in


this
 uh
 unwieldy
 acronym
 of
 ESG
 are


still
 moving
 forward
 I
 think


ESG
 as
 a
 concept
 is
 just
 becoming
 more


sophisticated
 I
 don't
 see
 there
 there's


there's
 the
 politics
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 around


climate
 uh
 and
 this
 sort
 of
 anti-woke


dynamic
 uh
 in
 certain
 aspects
 of
 us


politics
 I
 think
 uh
 if
 you
 break
 it
 down


in
 terms
 of
 the
 elements
 of
 what
 goes


into
 ESG
 climate
 continues
 to
 be
 an


issue
 and
 although
 people
 are
 talking


about
 it
 less
 I
 think
 companies
 are


still
 focused
 on
 it
 and
 recognize
 it's
 a


multi-decade
 challenge
 and
 we
 have
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 work
 through
 a


transition
 I
 think
 on
 the
 social
 and


governance
 um
 most
 companies
 are
 focused


on
 uh
 creating
 an
 inclusive
 environment


in
 the
 interest
 of
 attracting


employees
 uh
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 employee


value
 proposition
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 think
 the


political
 noise
 or
 backlash
 will


continue
 uh
 sort
 of
 in
 its
 own
 sphere
 uh


but
 if
 you
 are
 a
 company
 looking
 to


attract
 Talent
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 you


have
 an
 attractive
 environment
 have
 you


got
 a
 view
 on
 block
 chain
 a
 Bitcoin
 yes


uh


we
 did
 not
 move
 aggressively
 into
 uh


Bitcoin
 in
 its
 early
 uh
 boom
 years
 we


sort
 of
 expected
 it
 to
 have
 I
 don't
 want


to
 say
 we
 we
 were
 predicting
 uh
 the


decline
 but
 uh
 when
 you
 have
 that
 kind


of
 bubble
 or
 boom
 uh
 inevitably
 then
 it


tends
 to
 flame
 out
 and
 then
 there's
 uh
 a


return
 of
 a
 more
 sober
 approach
 and


probably
 a
 more
 regulated
 approach
 and


we're
 kind
 of
 seeing
 that
 that
 play
 out


in
 the
 environment
 today
 so
 uh
 we
 work


with
 uh
 digital
 Assets
 in
 a
 number
 of


different
 areas
 uh
 first
 of
 all
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 that
 we
 are
 the
 number


one
 provider
 in
 the
 world
 of
 real-time


pricing
 that
 includes
 pricing
 of
 digital


assets
 we
 also
 are
 uh
 working
 through


regulatory
 approval
 to
 clear
 digital


assets
 through
 our
 clearing


house
 uh
 each
 of
 these
 areas
 is
 really


about
 trying
 to
 facilitate
 instit


tional
 customers
 dealing
 with
 digital


assets
 whether
 that's
 Bitcoin
 or
 or


other
 digital
 Assets
 in
 a
 very
 credible


regulated
 manner
 uh
 and
 so
 we're
 not
 uh


given
 who
 we
 are
 we're
 a
 highly


regulated
 institution
 uh
 we're
 very


focused
 on
 working
 closely
 with
 The


Regulators
 we're
 not
 going
 out
 there


trying
 to
 build
 something
 in
 the
 world


of
 defi
 uh
 that
 is


unregulated
 uh
 we're
 very
 focused
 on


doing
 things
 in
 a
 transparent
 way


uh
 that
 institutions
 that
 are
 highly


regulated
 are
 comfortable
 with
 we
 are


also
 working
 on


building
 uh
 and
 this
 is
 a
 longer
 term


project
 but
 building
 digital
 Market


infrastructure
 uh
 and
 doing
 it
 with
 the


industry
 and
 building
 uh
 what
 we


describe
 as
 an
 asset
 class
 agnostic


digital
 Market
 infrastructure
 so
 that


the
 industry
 can
 use
 it
 that
 means
 it


will
 have
 the
 full
 value
 chain
 so


tokenization
 up
 front


execution
 basically


uh
 settlement
 and
 then
 custody
 built


into
 that
 market
 infrastructure
 uh
 doing


it
 in
 partnership
 with
 the
 industry
 is


the
 way
 we
 typically
 work
 doing
 it
 in
 a


regulated
 Manner
 and
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 way


that
 can
 be
 applicable
 as
 I
 said
 uh


across
 different
 asset
 classes
 it's
 just


the
 infrastructure
 that
 would
 work
 with


any
 particular
 asset
 class
 David
 moving


on
 to
 CEO
 pay
 which
 is
 something
 we
 feel


pretty
 strongly
 about
 what
 what
 kind
 of


Reflections
 do
 you
 have
 when
 it
 comes
 to


C
 so
 from
 our
 perspective
 and
 this
 ties


in
 uh
 importantly
 with
 the
 notion
 of


London
 as
 a
 Global
 Financial


Center
 uh
 we
 think
 that
 it
 needs
 to
 be


globally
 competitive
 and
 that
 then


quickly
 gets
 into
 a
 uh
 a
 discussion


around
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 is


the
 as
 CEO
 pay
 in
 the
 US
 uh
 excessive
 is


is
 it
 excessive
 I
 would
 say
 there
 there


are
 uh
 some
 examples
 where
 you
 look
 at


the
 numbers
 and
 you
 say
 does
 why
 does


someone
 need
 to
 be
 paid
 that
 amount
 for


for
 what
 they're
 doing
 fundamentally


it's
 uh
 it's
 about
 creating
 value
 for


shareholders
 uh
 that's
 how
 I
 think
 about


it
 personally
 uh
 and
 that's
 how
 we
 think


about
 it


conceptually
 but
 we
 operate
 in
 a
 global


market
 uh
 and
 so
 whether
 it's
 CEO
 pay
 or


whether
 it's
 uh
 pay
 for
 senior


Executives
 we
 have
 been
 bringing
 in
 a


lot
 of
 talent
 as
 we've
 been
 transforming


Elsa
 uh
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 talent
 that
 we


have
 been
 looking
 at
 uh
 is
 working
 in


the
 US
 uh
 and
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that


we
 can
 compete
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 attracting


that
 Global
 Talent
 uh
 I
 think
 that


applies
 to
 us
 but
 that
 that
 applies
 to


companies
 across
 the


UK
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 needs
 to
 be
 a


there's
 a
 a
 cultural
 aversion
 uh
 in
 the


UK
 and
 this
 you
 see
 this
 in
 the
 media


you
 see
 this
 in
 some
 of
 the
 proxy


agencies
 and
 a
 very
 different
 standard


to
 pay
 in
 the
 UK
 uh
 versus
 pay
 in
 other


jurisdictions
 particularly
 in
 the
 US
 and


so
 our
 uh
 we
 have
 been
 involved
 in
 a


growing
 dialogue
 uh
 on
 this
 topic
 in
 the


UK
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 important


element
 to
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 UK


continues
 and
 London
 continues
 to
 remain


globally
 competitive
 and
 attracting


worldclass
 Talent
 do
 you
 think
 American


cosos
 are
 better
 than
 um
 European
 cosos


uh
 I
 would
 not
 make
 that
 generalization


no
 speaking
 as
 an
 American
 uh
 I
 I
 don't


but
 I
 don't
 think
 think
 I
 can
 make
 that


generalization
 now
 no
 but
 certainly
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 pay
 difference
 you
 would


have
 thought
 there'd
 be
 a
 heck
 of
 a
 lot


better
 right
 if
 the
 pay
 difference
 was


the
 indication
 uh
 you
 would
 think
 I
 do


think
 there
 are
 some
 cultural


differences
 between
 American
 corporate


culture
 and
 uh
 UK
 corporate
 culture
 what


do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 essence
 of
 the


difference
 I
 think
 in
 the
 US
 success
 is


more
 celebrated
 and
 failure
 is
 more


tolerated
 and
 I
 think
 there
 is
 greater


RIS
 risk
 aversion
 uh
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 they


sense
 that
 uh
 it's


better
 uh
 to
 avoid
 failure
 uh
 and
 take


less
 risk
 uh
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 there's
 less


celebration
 of
 extraordinary
 success
 in


the
 UK
 and
 well
 you
 should
 you
 should


you
 should
 come
 to
 Norway
 and
 visit
 I


imagine
 it's
 different
 uh
 uh
 in
 many


different
 cultures
 but
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


that
 kind
 of
 comparison
 between
 uh
 the


US
 and
 the
 UK
 and
 I've
 certainly
 noticed


the
 difference
 in
 my
 time
 here
 do
 you


think
 shareholders
 actually
 have
 a
 an


impact
 here
 and
 what
 they
 say
 on
 cop
 I


mean
 we've
 been
 vocal
 for
 a
 long
 time


it's
 it's
 uh
 it's
 not
 really
 moving
 well


I
 think
 you
 know
 we
 pay
 attention
 to
 it


I
 can't
 uh
 can't
 speak
 for
 others
 we


certainly
 pay
 attention
 to
 it
 as
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 I
 think
 it's
 about


aligning
 the
 pay
 of
 Executives
 with
 the


shareholder


experience
 uh
 and
 I
 would
 say
 it's


important
 that
 that
 is
 aligned
 over
 the


medium
 to
 longterm
 within
 the
 construct


of
 what
 I
 was
 saying
 about
 um
 Global


competitiveness
 uh
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 be
 able
 to
 compete
 on
 a


global
 stage
 uh
 and
 attract
 Talent


globally
 but
 within
 that
 construct
 I


think
 uh
 the
 UK
 Market
 people
 pay
 a
 lot


of
 attention
 to
 that
 uh
 and
 I
 would
 say


perhaps
 so
 much
 attention
 to
 that
 uh


when
 these
 differential
 standards
 are


applied
 across
 geographies
 it
 makes
 it


hard
 to
 attract
 Talent
 from
 the
 US


moving
 on
 to
 um
 data
 analytics
 you
 know


a
 huge
 part
 of
 your
 business
 is
 in
 this


field
 how
 how
 will
 AI
 change
 your


business
 so
 we
 are
 embedding
 AI
 in
 a


number
 of
 different
 parts
 of
 our


business
 it's
 uh
 a
 capability
 that
 we


have
 been
 working
 with
 in
 a
 few


different
 areas
 for
 a
 while
 uh
 and


whether
 it's
 uh
 improving
 our
 operations


uh
 improving
 our
 customer
 service


improving
 some
 of
 the
 customer
 products


let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 examples
 uh
 we


have
 we
 get
 over
 a
 million
 customer


queries
 a
 year
 given
 the
 breadth
 of
 our


product


offering
 uh
 we
 get
 questions
 about
 all


kinds
 of
 things
 so
 someone
 may
 call
 us


up
 or
 email
 saying
 how
 do
 I
 uh
 get


pricing
 and
 then
 uh
 to
 a
 chart
 for
 uh


Indonesian
 versus
 Malaysian
 government


fonds
 um
 that's
 something
 that
 what


we're
 doing
 now
 we're
 using
 basically


large
 language
 model
 capability
 to


answer
 that
 question
 for
 our
 customer


service
 reps
 and
 as
 that
 model
 gets


better
 and
 better
 we
 are
 going
 to
 expose


that
 directly
 to
 the
 customers
 um
 and
 so


that's
 one
 example
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 due


diligence
 business
 that
 does
 due


diligence
 reports


for
 uh
 our
 customers
 one
 of
 the


complaints
 we
 got
 uh
 about
 the
 product


was
 that
 the
 reports
 were
 not
 written


well
 enough
 the
 English
 writing
 was
 not


good
 enough
 uh
 we
 now
 have
 uh
 those


being
 written
 WR
 using
 llm


capabilities
 makes
 the
 the
 actual


writing
 much
 better
 and
 then
 we
 have
 the


people
 going
 through
 the
 reports
 who


might
 English
 might
 not
 be
 their
 first


language
 but
 they're
 factchecking
 them


and
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 quality
 of
 the


data
 in
 them
 is
 accurate
 and
 better
 so


uh
 those
 are
 a
 couple
 examples
 we're
 of


course
 embedding
 AI
 functionality
 in
 the


different
 products
 that
 we're
 building


with


Microsoft
 which
 is
 going
 to
 uh
 bring
 a


whole
 new
 capability
 to
 uh
 what
 has


historically
 been
 uh
 you
 know
 I'll
 say
 a


fairly
 clunky
 space
 in
 terms
 of
 user


interface
 um
 whether
 that's
 desktop


products
 or
 others
 uh
 in
 the
 financial


sector
 so
 what
 kind
 of
 functionality


will
 you
 have
 now
 I'll
 give
 you
 a


specific
 example
 uh
 we
 are
 rolling
 out
 a


product
 called
 meeting


prep
 uh
 doing
 this
 with
 Microsoft
 what


will
 that
 be
 on
 your
 screen
 you'll
 have


a
 little
 button
 uh
 you
 click
 on
 the


meeting
 prep
 button
 you
 it
 opens
 up
 a


box
 you
 input
 the
 name
 of
 the
 person


you're
 meeting
 with
 uh
 and
 maybe
 the


company
 she's
 from
 and
 then
 you
 ask
 for


the
 meeting
 prep
 memo
 within
 15
 seconds


or
 so
 it
 will
 pull
 up
 and
 craft
 a
 memo


however
 long
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 based
 on


public
 data
 financial
 data
 research
 data


corporate
 data
 from
 us
 and
 then
 using
 uh


some
 of
 the
 AI
 functionality
 pulling
 all


the
 data
 that
 uh
 you
 make
 accessible
 to


it
 from
 your
 email
 your
 files
 your
 CRM


system
 oh
 and
 I
 think
 we
 all
 know
 in
 in


these
 various
 Industries
 when
 you
 have
 a


meeting
 with
 someone
 you
 you
 may
 have


someone
 on
 your
 team
 preparing
 that
 kind


of
 memo
 over
 the
 course
 of
 a
 few
 hours


uh
 and
 this
 will
 be
 ready
 in
 15
 seconds


or
 so
 and
 if
 it
 if
 it
 doesn't
 have


everything
 you
 want
 or
 if
 you
 wanted
 to


refocus
 on
 a
 certain
 new
 area
 you
 can


just
 ask
 it
 to
 pretty
 handy
 for
 my


podcast
 preparation
 it
 would
 uh
 it
 would


the
 use
 cases
 are
 uh
 kind
 of
 amazing


when
 you
 think
 about
 it
 David
 uh
 we


touched
 on
 um
 corpa
 culture
 what
 have


you
 done
 with
 the
 Cora
 culture
 at
 the


eleg
 culture
 has
 been
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


change
 that
 we
 have
 been
 going
 through


so
 when
 I
 arrived
 at
 eleg
 uh
 it
 was
 in


in
 many
 ways
 it
 was
 a
 collection
 of


great
 assets
 uh
 it
 was
 not
 really


operating
 as
 an
 integrated
 company
 uh


and
 so


really
 from
 day
 one
 uh
 or
 actually
 I'll


say
 uh
 three
 months
 in
 because
 I
 spent


my
 first
 three
 months
 just
 talking
 to


people
 and
 and
 learning
 my
 way
 around


and
 understanding
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 issues
 I


was
 very
 focused
 after
 that
 those
 first


few
 months
 I
 was
 very
 focused
 on


creating
 a
 common
 culture
 for
 the


organization
 how
 would
 you
 do
 that
 well


you
 have
 to
 Define
 it
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


what
 your
 aspiration
 is
 what
 your
 intent


is
 so
 at
 eleg
 I
 mentioned
 it
 was
 a


collection
 assets
 we
 were
 uh
 we
 had
 some


great
 businesses
 uh
 but
 they
 were


operating
 in
 a
 siloed
 way
 or
 a
 segmented


way
 so
 we
 had
 to
 make
 it
 clear
 that
 we


wanted
 people
 to
 operate
 in
 a
 more


connected
 way
 uh
 and
 a
 more
 integrated


way
 we
 had
 an
 environment
 where
 in


certain
 parts
 of
 the
 business
 people


were
 very
 comfortable
 operating
 the
 way


they
 had
 always
 been
 operating
 um
 and
 it


had
 been
 fine
 uh
 so
 we
 were
 very
 focused


on
 creating
 an
 environment
 where
 people


were
 willing
 to
 change
 that
 and
 we're


willing
 to
 disrupt
 themselves
 and
 then


we
 also
 had
 parts
 of
 the
 business
 that


were
 operating
 spectacularly
 well
 and


then
 we
 had
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 business


that
 uh
 were
 really
 more
 comfortable


with
 mediocrity
 uh
 to
 be
 blunt
 about
 it


and
 so
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 we


wanted
 to
 raise
 the
 bar
 across
 the


organization
 uh
 this
 was
 all
 before
 we


went
 through
 a
 significant
 acquisition


uh
 of
 a
 business
 called
 reative
 um
 and


that
 added
 a
 significant
 level
 of
 uh


challenge
 in
 terms
 of
 creating
 a
 common


culture
 but
 but
 I
 mean
 how
 do
 you
 go


about
 it
 I
 mean
 you
 can't
 just
 say
 hi


guys
 uh
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 work
 harder


and
 really
 lift
 the
 bar
 and
 we're
 all


going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 more
 money
 what


specifically
 do
 you
 do
 you
 have
 to
 model


it
 at
 the
 senior
 Le
 leadership
 level
 you


have
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 all
 the
 time
 you


have
 to
 embed
 it
 in
 all
 the
 different


processes
 that
 you
 have
 and
 that
 means


you
 have
 to
 evaluate
 people
 on
 whether


they
 are
 living
 up
 to
 your
 cultural


aspirations
 so


uh
 one
 of
 the
 processes
 that
 we
 went


through
 this
 past
 year
 uh
 was
 an


exercise
 of
 really
 engaging
 the
 whole


organization
 in
 talking
 about
 what
 are


our
 values
 at
 ELC
 uh
 and
 um
 we
 had
 a


massive
 survey
 and
 we
 uh
 had
 focus


groups
 Etc
 and
 our
 people
 came
 up
 with


the
 values
 of
 the
 organization
 and


that's
 an
 important
 underpinning
 it's


real
 Foundation
 of
 our
 culture
 and


making
 sure
 that
 our
 people
 are


living
 in
 line
 with
 those
 values
 if
 you


think
 about
 what
 what
 is
 culture
 it
 is


the
 uh
 it's
 the
 rules
 of
 behavior
 for
 an


organization
 often
 Unwritten
 rules
 David


you
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 Goldman
 saxs


MH
 is
 the
 culture
 at
 eleg
 different
 from


Goldman
 Sachs
 or
 are
 you
 aspiring
 to


bring
 the
 Goldman
 Sachs
 culture
 into


eleg
 very
 different
 cultures
 uh
 there


are
 parts
 of
 the
 Goldman
 Sachs


culture
 uh
 that
 I
 think


uh
 I
 have
 been
 trying
 to
 bring
 a
 little


bit
 more
 into
 such
 such
 as
 well
 so
 in
 my


I
 think
 it
 was
 I
 had
 only
 been
 at
 eleg
 a


couple
 months
 and
 I
 was
 visiting
 the


Paris
 office
 of
 eleg
 and
 uh
 someone


raised
 a
 question
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 in


Goldman
 Sachs
 that
 is
 helpful
 for
 us


here
 at
 lch
 SAA
 and
 I
 said
 that's
 really


interesting
 in
 my
 20
 years
 at
 Goldman


Sachs
 no
 one
 ever
 asked
 me
 about
 their


specific
 legal
 entity
 or
 operating
 unit


that
 has
 been
 an
 important
 part
 about


creating
 a
 more
 connected
 eleg
 uh
 in


terms
 of
 making
 people
 whether
 they're


in
 Paris
 or
 Tokyo
 or
 Cape
 Town
 and
 we


operate
 all
 over
 the
 world
 so
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 build
 down
 those
 silos
 so
 a


couple
 things
 uh


when
 when
 I
 arrived
 at
 ELC
 we
 didn't


have
 a
 common
 uh
 review
 process
 the


reviews
 were
 done
 within
 each
 business


unit
 and
 the
 head
 of
 the
 business
 unit


would
 uh
 make
 decisions
 about
 his
 or
 her


people
 and
 that
 was
 that
 uh
 we
 have
 now


created
 a
 common
 review
 process
 across


the
 organization
 we
 calibrate
 across
 the


organization
 we've
 created
 a
 group
 of


senior
 leaders
 basically
 our
 top
 hundred


people
 we
 get
 them
 together
 once
 a
 month


so
 they
 all
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 across


the
 organization
 we
 have
 um
 done
 a


number
 of
 different
 structural
 things


like
 that


uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 are
 thinking


across
 the
 organization
 we
 have
 thought


about
 do
 you
 embedd
 it
 in
 your


compensation
 uh
 structure
 uh
 we
 haven't


actually
 had
 to
 do
 that
 because
 uh
 it's


actually
 working
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 people


in
 one
 part
 of
 the
 business
 actually


helping


introduce
 um
 someone
 in
 the
 other
 part


of
 the
 business
 to
 a
 strong
 customer


relationship
 but
 you
 have
 to
 model
 it
 uh


and
 you
 have
 to
 really
 focus
 on


embedding
 and
 it
 doesn't
 it
 it's
 not


quick
 it's
 a
 multi-
 multi-year
 process


so
 what
 kind
 of
 people
 do
 you
 promote
 to


achieve
 this
 you
 have
 to
 promote
 people


who
 are
 living
 that
 culture
 and
 living


those
 values
 it's
 been
 another


interesting
 change
 for
 the
 organization


we
 historically
 have
 been
 in
 an


organization
 of
 very
 impressive
 subject


matter
 experts
 given
 the
 kind
 of


business
 that
 we
 are
 in
 and
 the


important
 of
 expertise
 in
 our
 business


uh
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 subject
 matter


expertise
 within
 eleg
 is
 extraordinary


across
 a
 broad
 range
 of
 of
 aspects
 of


financial
 markets
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we've
 been
 very
 focused
 on
 over
 the


last
 few
 years
 is
 in
 some
 cases
 taking


those
 subject
 matter
 experts
 and
 making


them
 helping
 them
 training
 them
 and


turning
 them
 into
 leaders
 of
 people
 and


leaders
 of
 businesses
 and
 in
 some
 cases


we've
 also
 been
 bringing
 that
 talent
 in


from
 outside
 uh
 so
 uh
 a
 big
 focus
 on
 the


development
 of
 our
 talent
 how
 easy
 is
 it


to
 make
 a
 subject
 expert
 into
 a
 general


leader
 not
 easy
 no
 not
 easy
 if
 but
 it's


a
 really
 interesting
 debate
 I
 mean
 we
 of


course
 have
 it
 here
 in
 the
 font
 as
 well


we
 got
 some
 incredible
 experts
 and
 many


people
 like
 to
 be
 led
 by
 experts
 to
 have


the
 credibility
 and
 someone
 they
 love
 to


be
 led
 by
 experts
 there
 is
 a
 really
 it's


a
 really
 two-side
 the
 discussion
 this


and
 frankly
 there
 are
 some


people
 where
 they
 add
 and
 and
 there
 are


some
 roles
 uh
 that
 are
 right
 for
 people


who
 are
 subject
 matter
 experts
 but
 may


not
 be
 great
 people
 leaders
 that's
 okay


but
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the
 right
 mix
 and


importantly


in
 the
 roles
 that
 require
 leadership
 and


require
 real
 management
 of
 teams
 and


require
 the
 development
 of
 talent
 you


have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 people
 in


those
 roles
 do
 have
 those
 skills
 now
 to


make
 this
 all
 um
 tick
 what
 is
 your


leadership
 philosophy


to
 bring
 in
 great
 people
 or
 to
 have


great
 people
 on
 my
 team
 to
 get
 them


aligned
 around
 the
 Strategic


Direction
 and
 then
 to
 give
 them
 uh
 a
 lot


of
 running
 room
 and
 then
 I
 uh
 I
 like


to
 periodically
 drill
 down
 into
 the


details
 of
 certain
 areas
 not
 as
 a


micromanager
 but
 more
 just
 because
 I
 I


like
 knowing
 what's
 going
 on
 and
 I
 like


getting
 into
 the
 specifics
 of
 things
 but


as
 I
 said
 I'll
 do
 that
 not
 in
 a


micromanaging
 way
 but
 understand
 what's


going
 on
 and
 then
 uh
 pop
 back
 out
 oh
 are


you
 sure
 you're
 not
 Market
 managing
 I


think
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 so
 yeah
 I
 haven't


that
 that
 has
 not
 been
 an
 issue
 that
 uh


has
 come
 up
 in
 in
 my
 reviews
 now
 the
 CEO


of
 um
 Goldman's
 um
 said
 that
 we
 had
 him


on
 the
 podcast
 that
 leadership
 is
 to


take
 people
 where
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 go


now
 where
 are
 you
 taking
 people
 at
 eleg


where
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 I
 I
 think
 a


part
 of
 leadership
 uh
 can
 be
 taking


people
 in
 a
 New
 Direction
 uh
 I'm
 not


sure
 it's
 necessarily
 where
 they
 don't


want
 to
 go
 it
 may
 be
 where
 they
 didn't


know
 they
 did
 want
 to
 go
 yeah
 um
 and
 so


I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example
 when
 we


acquired
 the
 refini
 of
 business
 so
 uh


this
 was
 an
 acquisition
 that
 we
 closed


on
 uh
 at
 the
 at
 basically
 end
 of
 January


2021
 and
 at
 that
 point
 uh
 refinitiv
 had


about
 25,000
 people
 eleg
 had
 about
 5,000


people
 uh
 so
 it
 was
 a
 massive


acquisition
 for
 us
 the
 refini
 of


business
 was
 growing
 at
 one
 or
 2%
 a
 year


on
 the
 back
 of
 a
 2%
 annual
 price


rise
 and
 Ela


had
 prior
 to
 that
 had
 had
 a
 strong
 track


record
 of
 high
 growth
 so
 there
 was
 an


enormous
 question
 in
 the
 marketplace
 and


frankly
 within
 eleg
 how
 do
 we
 take
 this


massive
 business
 and
 get
 it
 to
 change


and
 and
 grow
 and
 so
 there's
 there's
 a


lot
 that
 we
 went
 through
 uh
 to
 do
 that


we
 now
 have
 that
 business
 growing
 you


know
 at
 attractive
 rates
 uh
 as
 of
 the


last
 quarter
 was
 about
 7%
 growth
 so


massive
 change
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years


that's
 something
 that
 we
 had
 to
 change
 a


lot
 of
 how
 people
 operated
 and
 a
 lot
 of


how
 that
 organization
 worked
 and
 there


was
 some


resistance
 institutional
 bureaucratic
 uh


but
 we
 now
 have
 people
 incredibly


excited
 about
 the
 direction
 that
 we're


going
 in
 so
 I
 think


it's
 uh
 leadership
 is
 more
 about


communicating
 where
 you're
 trying
 to
 get


people
 and
 then
 showing
 them
 how
 you're


going
 to
 get


there


than
 uh
 taking
 people
 where
 they
 don't


want
 to
 go
 when
 you
 uh
 make
 a
 big


decision
 how
 important
 is
 gut
 feeli
 or


pattern
 recognition
 relative
 to
 analysis


and


numbers
 I


think
 gut
 feeli
 is
 important
 in
 the


context
 of
 having
 a
 really
 good


understanding
 of
 the


situation
 uh
 and
 so
 you're
 never
 going


to
 have
 perfect


information
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 in
 most
 of


these
 situations
 where
 we're
 dealing


with
 complex
 decisions
 or
 complex


systems
 uh
 you
 often
 have
 to
 make
 a


judgment
 call
 I'm
 very
 comfortable


making
 a
 judgment
 call
 uh
 you
 know
 or
 or


using
 gut
 feel
 if
 you
 will
 in
 a


situation
 where
 I've
 I
 feel
 like
 I


understand
 the
 broader
 situation
 and


understand
 the
 underlying
 drivers
 uh
 I


think
 the
 notion
 of
 making
 a
 gut
 feel
 in


a
 situation
 that
 you
 otherwise
 don't


know
 much
 about
 or
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 can
 Verge
 on
 into
 the
 realm
 of
 of


Reckless
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 you
 absolutely


have
 to
 make
 some
 judgments
 with


imperfect
 information
 uh
 and
 that's


effectively
 what
 uh
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 it
 judgment
 um
 got
 feel
 you
 have
 to


exercise
 that
 and
 you
 have
 to
 be
 willing


to
 do
 that
 and
 you
 have
 to
 be
 willing


frankly
 to
 make
 mistakes
 I
 think
 if
 you


if
 you
 go
 into
 a
 decision
 process


knowing
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 some


mistakes
 you
 want
 to
 make
 more
 good


decisions
 than
 bad
 decision
 decisions


but
 you
 got
 to
 keep
 moving
 forward


that's
 okay
 how
 would
 you
 deal
 with


mistakes
 try
 to
 acknowledge
 them
 openly


and
 address
 uh
 what
 the
 issues
 were
 sort


of
 Lessons
 Learned
 you
 know
 we
 we
 have
 a


we
 have
 a
 great
 process
 internally


within


eleg
 um
 where
 you
 know
 if
 there's
 a


problem
 if
 there's
 an
 outage
 if
 there's


an
 issue
 you
 know
 we
 do
 incident
 reviews


uh
 we
 try
 to
 do
 Lessons
 Learned
 we
 try


to
 track
 all
 we
 track
 the
 serious


incidents
 but
 we
 also
 track
 the
 less


serious
 incidents
 because
 they're
 the


ones
 where
 you
 can
 learn
 a
 lot
 from
 and


make
 sure
 that
 you
 address
 issues
 before


they
 become
 serious
 incidents
 so
 and
 we


have
 this
 is
 another
 aspect
 that
 we
 are


really
 building
 into
 and
 embedding
 in


our
 culture
 because


eleg
 pre
 reative
 a
 a
 strong
 risk


management
 culture
 refinitiv
 came
 out
 of


Thompson
 reuter
 which
 was
 a
 media


company
 uh
 and
 Views
 itself
 as


effectively
 a
 media
 company
 there
 was


very
 little
 concept
 of
 risk
 management


in
 the
 way
 that
 the
 financial
 sector


thinks
 about
 risk
 management
 David
 I'd


love
 to
 um
 end
 with
 some
 personal


questions
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 setbacks


personally
 I
 think
 you
 just
 have
 to


recognize
 it's
 it's
 all
 part
 of
 the
 game


if
 you
 will
 not
 that
 life
 is
 a
 game
 but


like
 setbacks
 happen
 and
 what's
 been


your
 main
 setbacks
 in
 life
 I
 would
 say


uh
 know
 things
 things
 go
 wrong
 all
 the


time
 uh
 from
 a
 career


perspective
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 funny
 you


asked
 earlier
 about
 Goldman
 Sachs
 um
 I


think
 I
 must
 have
 applied
 to
 Goldman


Sachs
 three
 times
 before
 I
 got
 a
 job


there
 over
 the
 course
 of
 several
 years


um
 uh
 so
 that
 that's
 just
 an
 example
 of


yeah
 setback
 okay
 you
 didn't
 get
 it
 Jack


ma
 in
 um
 applied
 to
 Harvard
 10
 times
 he


never
 got
 in
 you
 did
 you
 you
 did


actually
 you
 did
 actually
 get
 into


Harvard
 I
 I
 did
 for
 law
 school
 yes
 um
 I


think
 but
 it's
 it's
 just
 the
 point
 of


like
 setbacks
 are
 part
 of
 life
 you
 have


to
 sort
 of
 assume
 there
 will
 be
 setbacks


and
 you
 keep
 going
 and
 uh
 can
 you
 get


discouraged
 in
 certain
 things
 or
 if
 if


there's
 something
 that
 you're
 going
 for


that's
 just
 not
 realistic
 and
 you
 you


sort
 of
 change
 direction
 that's
 okay
 um


but
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 expect
 and
 then


it's
 sort
 of
 a
 question
 what's
 what's


your
 personal
 resilience
 and
 do
 you
 want


to
 just
 keep
 trying
 do
 you
 want
 to
 keep


going
 uh
 or
 do
 you
 change
 course
 how


important
 is
 your
 personal
 Network
 I


think


huh
 interesting
 um
 you
 know
 when
 I
 got


to
 the
 UK
 I
 I
 was
 not
 a
 part
 of
 the


network
 here
 at
 all
 oh
 you
 know
 I
 have


be
 I've
 gotten
 to
 know
 more
 people
 and


gotten
 more
 embedded
 in
 the
 community


and
 whether
 that's
 from
 a
 government


perspective
 the
 corporate
 world
 the
 the


media
 world
 and
 have
 uh
 built
 more
 and


more
 of
 that
 Network
 I
 think
 networks


are
 important
 uh
 and
 helpful
 and
 I
 think


it
 is
 it
 can
 be
 an
 important
 part
 of
 how


someone
 can
 develop
 or
 rise
 up
 through


organizations
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 in
 this


world
 for
 good
 or
 for
 bad
 is
 based
 on


personal
 relationships
 and
 so
 it
 is


important
 to
 build
 those
 relationships


and
 what's
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 to
 doing


that
 to
 building
 relationships
 yeah
 I


think
 look
 everyone's
 going
 to
 have


their
 own


style
 um
 my
 style
 is
 to
 be


straightforward
 try
 to
 be
 clear
 I


believe
 in
 decency
 if
 I
 can
 put
 it
 that


way
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 treat


people
 well
 uh
 humility
 is
 really


important
 to
 me
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


patience
 or
 interest
 in
 in
 dealing
 with


big
 egos
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 areas


that
 uh
 with
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 I
 approach


uh
 relationships
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 more


important
 to
 be
 respected
 than
 liked
 how


do
 you
 avoid
 becoming
 a
 big
 eagle
 I


think
 you


just
 keep
 your
 feet
 on
 the
 ground
 uh


it's
 really
 helpful
 to
 have


kids
 and
 a
 partner
 perhaps
 yes
 uh
 you


know
 they
 don't
 care
 how
 important
 your


job
 is
 or
 how
 people
 treat
 you
 at
 work


uh
 and
 they're
 uh
 they've
 got
 their
 own


issues
 and
 their
 own


needs
 so
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 just
 a


value
 set
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 it's
 a
 really


interesting
 question
 um
 I
 think
 modesty


and
 humility
 is
 is
 uh
 it's
 just
 an


important
 way
 dealing
 with
 people
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 a
 justification
 is


kind
 of
 how
 I
 would
 answer
 there's
 no


rationale
 or
 justification
 for
 someone


to
 have
 a
 big
 ego
 that
 seems
 almost
 like


it's


a
 it's
 compensation
 for
 insecurity
 is


kind
 of
 how
 I
 think
 about
 it
 yeah
 how
 do


you
 relax
 like
 spending
 time
 with
 my


family
 I
 like
 getting
 exercise
 and
 I


love
 reading
 what
 do
 you
 read
 all
 kinds


of
 things
 I
 love
 reading


histories
 I
 like
 books
 about
 how
 how


people
 think
 almost
 finished
 with
 a
 a


relatively
 new
 book
 about
 the
 uh
 the


Japan
 war
 crimes
 tribunal
 called


Judgment
 at
 Tokyo
 um
 really
 interesting


but
 I
 love
 reading
 I
 also
 like
 just


reading
 current
 events
 uh
 reading


articles
 in
 in
 different
 Publications
 so


favorite


publication
 oh
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 would
 name


a
 favorite
 uh
 and
 I
 read
 a
 few
 different


newspapers
 few
 different
 magazines
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you
 do
 endorsements
 here


on
 on
 your
 podcast


so
 and
 David
 last
 last
 question
 what
 is


your
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people


don't
 set
 your
 own


limits
 I
 think
 in
 so
 many
 situations


people
 don't
 even
 go
 for
 something


because
 they're
 scared
 they
 won't
 get


it
 and
 that
 is
 such
 an
 unnecessary


limitation
 on
 what
 people
 might
 go
 for


so
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 important
 the


environment
 will
 make
 sure
 there
 were


enough
 limitations
 exactly
 exactly
 the


environment
 takes
 care
 of
 that
 so
 you


shouldn't
 add
 it
 add
 to
 it
 yourself
 very


good
 David
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 very
 few


limitations
 for
 eleg
 we
 wish
 you
 um
 all


the
 best
 and
 it's
 been
 really
 fantastic


to
 have
 you
 on
 big
 thanks
 thank
 you


Nikolai
 pleasure
 to
 be
