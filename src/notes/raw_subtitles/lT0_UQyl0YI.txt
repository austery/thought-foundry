If
 AI
 can
 do
 the
 math,
 write
 emails
 and


even
 draft
 contracts.
 Why
 are
 lawyers


and
 accountants
 still
 in
 business?


Lawyer,
 $500
 an
 hour,
 an
 LLM
 $20
 a


month.
 Both
 provide
 answers
 and
 even


some
 degree
 of
 emotional
 support.
 So,


why
 aren't
 these
 going
 anywhere?
 Because


the
 consequences
 are
 different.
 I've


been
 wanting
 to
 do
 an
 episode
 on
 why
 it


is
 so
 damn
 hard
 to
 build
 an
 AI
 business


or
 an
 AI
 app
 that
 can
 replace
 a


specialist,
 but
 that
 wouldn't
 help
 you


to
 know
 what
 to
 build.
 So,
 instead,
 I


decided
 to
 tie
 this
 video
 to
 the


previous
 video
 on
 why
 most
 AI
 startups


are
 bad
 businesses
 and
 talk
 about
 how
 to


actually
 build
 a
 sustainable
 AI
 product


that
 will
 outlive
 the
 hype
 blown
 up
 VC


rounds
 and
 one
 that
 can
 actually
 bring


you
 billions
 of
 dollars.
 This
 is
 for


those
 of
 you
 who
 evaluate
 AI


investments,
 especially
 now
 that
 we're


in
 the
 middle
 of
 2026
 budget
 planning,


as
 well
 as
 for
 potential
 and
 current


founders
 looking
 for
 a
 problem
 that
 is


really
 worth
 solving.
 Let's
 dive
 in.


Why
 does
 the
 labor
 of
 a
 lawyer,
 an


accountant,
 or
 a
 tax
 adviser
 cost
 so


much?
 Remember
 this
 song
 that
 was


circulating
 social
 media
 some
 time
 ago?


>> Exposure
 doesn't
 pay
 the
 bills.
 It
 cost


that
 much
 cuz
 it
 takes
 me
 hours.


>> The
 ambition
 to
 replace
 high-cost


professionals
 with
 AI
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


significant
 miscalculations
 in
 modern


technology
 entrepreneurship.
 And
 I
 think


that
 the
 fundamental
 problem
 lies
 in


combining
 the
 hours
 with
 responsibility.


This
 distinction
 creates
 devastating


economic
 consequences
 for
 companies


aiming
 at
 full
 replacement
 of
 a


professional.
 To
 understand
 why,
 let's


break
 down
 what
 a
 specialist
 does.
 Let's


use
 a
 lawyer
 as
 an
 example,
 but
 this


applies
 to
 accounting,
 finance,
 tax


advising,
 and
 similar
 high-cost
 high-v


value
 professions.
 The
 work
 of
 a


specialist
 can
 be
 largely
 divided
 into


two
 categories.
 The
 first
 category
 is


admin.
 Input
 data,
 analyze
 the
 data,


make
 a
 recommendation,
 spit
 out
 a


document,
 write
 an
 email.
 These
 tasks


usually
 repeat
 from
 a
 client
 to
 client,


a
 patient
 to
 patient.
 It's
 usually
 the


tasks
 with
 very
 low
 variability
 because


a
 specialist
 has
 to
 follow
 a
 protocol.


Let's
 use
 a
 hypothetical
 situation
 that


people
 often
 encounter
 when
 they,
 for


example,
 are
 going
 through
 a
 divorce.


When
 you're
 going
 through
 a
 divorce,
 you


typically
 need
 a
 family
 lawyer.
 So,
 how


does
 your
 interaction
 with
 a
 lawyer


begin?
 You
 call
 them,
 you
 tell
 them


about
 your
 situation.
 They
 listen
 to


you.
 They
 assess
 your
 options.
 If
 you


have
 common
 children,
 if
 you
 have
 a


property,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 mutual
 business,


how
 can
 those
 things
 be
 split,
 etc.,


etc.?
 This
 is
 the
 step
 when
 you're


inputting
 data.
 You're
 inputting
 data


into
 your
 lawyer's
 brain.
 They
 analyze


it.
 They
 provide
 a
 recommendation
 based


on
 your
 situation
 and
 they
 start


communication
 with
 the
 lawyer
 of
 your


former
 partner.
 Chances
 are
 your
 case
 is


fairly
 common
 and
 a
 relatively


experienced
 family
 lawyer
 has
 seen
 it


before.
 But
 what
 this
 similarity
 means


is
 that
 your
 lawyer
 is
 going
 to
 be


repeating
 the
 same
 procedures
 that
 they


always
 do.
 If
 we
 map
 this
 scenario
 to


how
 much
 it
 would
 cost
 you
 to
 hire
 an


intermediate
 level
 lawyer
 in
 Toronto,


for
 example,
 it'll
 be
 around
 $500
 an


hour.
 You
 tell
 them
 about
 your


situation.
 That's
 the
 first
 hour.
 They


provide
 a
 recommendation.
 That's
 the


second
 hour.
 And
 then
 you
 start


communicating
 or
 they
 start


communicating
 with
 a
 fellow
 lawyer
 of


your
 former
 partner.
 So
 let's
 say
 three


more
 hours.
 So
 we
 just
 spent
 $2,500
 on


the
 initiation
 of
 the
 case.
 In
 the


interest
 of
 time
 and
 for
 the
 purpose
 of


this
 problem
 discovery
 exercise,
 let's


keep
 it
 at
 $2500.
 Please
 don't
 come
 at


me
 and
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,
 it's
 $7,000
 or


it's
 $500."
 Let's
 just
 assume
 that
 it's


2500.
 Now,
 is
 this
 easy
 to
 automate?


Objectively,
 yes.
 Everything
 I've
 said


until
 this
 point
 is
 fairly
 easy
 to


automate
 for
 the
 vast
 majority
 of


divorce
 cases.
 Are
 there
 going
 to
 be


exceptions?
 Of
 course.
 But
 let's
 say
 for


80%
 of
 divorce
 cases,
 the
 procedure
 is


going
 to
 be
 straightforward.
 So,


creating
 a
 way
 to
 input
 data,
 building


an
 algorithm
 to
 provide
 a


recommendation,
 drafting
 emails
 and


sending
 them.
 Very
 common
 use
 cases
 for


an
 AI
 app.
 But
 what
 happens
 after?
 And


the
 thing
 that
 happens
 after
 is
 the


point
 where
 automation
 ends
 because


beyond
 this
 point
 you
 stop
 paying
 for


the
 hours
 and
 that
 is
 because
 beyond


this
 point
 you
 enter
 the
 phase
 of


negotiations
 and
 where
 there
 is


negotiation
 there
 is
 responsibility.


Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 economics
 of


responsibility.


If
 you're
 building
 a
 company
 you
 already


know
 scaling
 means
 hiring.
 With
 every


hire,
 you're
 looking
 at
 payroll
 setup,


benefits
 enrollment,
 IT
 provisioning,


access
 to
 12
 different
 tools,
 corporate


card
 compliance
 paperwork.
 Onboarding


one
 takes
 your
 op
 teams
 about
 6
 hours,


but
 you're
 hiring
 15
 this
 quarter.


That's
 90
 hours
 of
 manual
 work.
 Most


companies
 are
 running
 on
 100
 plus


disconnected
 tools.
 Now,
 each
 one
 solves


the
 problem,
 but
 together
 they
 create


silos.
 Ripling,
 one
 of
 the
 fastest


growing
 HR,
 IT,
 and
 spend
 platforms
 out


there,
 calls
 this
 SAD
 software
 as
 a


disservice.
 To
 combat
 this,
 Ripling


built
 a
 unified
 platform
 across
 four


systems
 that
 run
 your
 company.
 One


source
 of
 truth
 for
 all
 employee
 data


that
 allows
 you
 to
 manage
 HR,
 payroll,


spend,
 and
 IT
 in
 one
 unified
 system.
 You


can
 hire
 contractors
 in
 more
 than
 185


countries
 and
 full-time
 employees
 in


more
 than
 80
 countries
 and
 pay
 them
 in


different
 currencies,
 which
 really


matters
 because
 your
 next
 hire
 probably


isn't
 local.
 New
 hire
 gets
 their
 laptop,


all
 accounts,
 correct
 permissions
 based


on
 their
 role,
 all
 automatically.


Someone
 leaves,
 everything
 gets


deprovisioned
 instantly.
 Realtime


visibility
 into
 company
 spending.
 No


more
 waiting
 for
 expense
 reports.
 No


more
 budget
 surprises.
 Rippling
 is


trusted
 by
 more
 than
 20,000
 companies


across
 a
 range
 of
 industries
 including


cursor,
 berry,
 chz.com,
 and
 liquid


death.
 Every
 fragmented
 system
 in
 your


stack
 is
 holding
 back
 execution.


Rippling
 provides
 four
 core
 systems
 to


manage
 your
 entire
 staff
 end
 to
 end.
 HR,


payroll,
 IT,
 and
 spend
 management.
 All


connected,
 all
 automated,
 helping
 you


increase
 savings
 and
 make
 better


decisions.
 And
 that's
 how
 you
 build
 a


company
 that
 can
 actually
 move
 as
 fast


as
 you
 scale.
 Check
 out
 stops
 sad.com
 to


see
 if
 SAD
 is
 affecting
 your


organization
 and
 what
 you
 can
 do
 about


it.


The
 core
 issue
 isn't
 whether
 AI
 can


technically
 do
 it.
 It's
 in
 the
 liability


surface
 area.
 When
 professionals
 charge


$500
 per
 hour,
 clients
 aren't
 paying
 for


the
 time.
 They're
 paying
 for
 someone
 to


carry
 legal
 and
 financial
 responsibility


when
 things
 go
 wrong.
 This


responsibility
 gap
 creates
 multiple


economic
 pressures
 that
 destroy
 AI


business
 models
 that
 are
 aimed
 at


professional
 replacement.
 From
 the
 point


when
 you
 enter
 the
 phase
 of
 negotiations


and
 onward,
 what
 you're
 paying
 for
 is


not
 an
 hour
 of
 their
 time.
 Sure,
 they


can
 charge
 you
 for
 billable
 hours,
 but


it's
 up
 to
 the
 lawyer
 on
 how
 they
 price


their
 work.
 It
 can
 be
 by
 the
 hour,
 it


can
 be
 by
 a
 fixed
 rate
 or
 it
 can
 be
 a


contingency
 fee.
 But
 what
 you
 are
 paying


for
 is
 the
 responsibility
 that
 that


lawyer
 is
 going
 to
 carry
 and
 the


ultimate
 outcome
 that
 they
 promise
 to


deliver.
 When
 AI
 founders
 embark
 on
 a


journey
 to
 replace
 an
 expensive


professionals
 even
 for
 a
 narrow
 use


case.
 So
 going
 back
 to
 our
 example,
 when


a
 founder
 says,
 "We
 want
 to
 automate
 the


work
 of
 a
 family
 lawyer
 who
 specializes


in
 divorce
 cases."
 This
 is
 already


narrow.
 Not
 all
 lawyers
 out
 there
 but


specifically
 family
 lawyers
 and
 the


within
 the
 family
 lawyers
 just
 the
 ones


who
 specialize
 in
 divorce
 cases.
 But


when
 they
 do
 that
 they
 start
 playing


with
 the
 riskshifting
 mechanism
 that


exposes
 the
 professional
 replacement


fallacy.
 When
 children
 joint
 property
 a


spousal
 support
 are
 at
 issue.
 The
 lawyer


must
 anticipate
 and
 plan
 for
 all
 kinds


of
 outcomes
 and
 calculate
 each
 step


given
 the
 constraints
 and
 most


importantly
 sign
 their
 name
 as
 council


of
 record
 on
 binding
 agreements
 or
 court


filings.
 If
 the
 child's
 custody


arrangement
 does
 not
 serve
 their
 best


interests,
 lawyers
 face
 investigations,


disciplinary
 hearings,
 and
 possible


suspension
 or
 even
 disbarment.
 Defending


against
 these
 regulatory
 and
 bar
 actions


can
 cost
 between
 50
 to
 200
 plus,000
 in


legal
 fees
 alone,
 not
 counting
 any


client
 compensation
 awarded.
 If
 a
 poorly


worded
 support
 order
 results
 in


long-term
 financial
 harm
 to
 the
 client,


the
 lawyer's
 insurer
 typically
 pays
 for


damages.
 The
 minimum
 required
 liability


coverage
 in
 Ontario
 is
 $1
 million,
 and


many
 firms
 carry
 between
 $2
 to
 $6


million.
 In
 contrast,
 AI
 platforms


typically
 cap
 vendor
 liability
 at
 the


annual
 contract
 value,
 often
 just


between
 10
 to
 $100,000
 per
 client
 or
 per


business.
 Most
 AI
 products
 in
 legal
 tech


stipulate
 that
 if
 their
 software
 misses


an
 asset
 or
 miscalculate
 support,
 the


refund
 is
 limited
 to
 the
 subscription


fee
 and
 no
 coverage
 of
 actual
 losses.
 AI


tools
 do
 not
 provide
 malpractice


insurance
 for
 clients.
 If
 an
 error
 costs


the
 client
 $500,000,
 the
 client
 bears


the
 risk
 and
 cost.
 There
 is
 no


million-doll
 coverage,
 there
 is
 no


insurance
 guarantee
 and
 no
 regulatory


recourse
 against
 the
 AI
 vendor.
 AI


platforms
 will
 always
 lose
 to
 a
 real


professional
 in
 the
 negotiation
 stage


because
 they
 never
 sign
 as
 council
 of


record
 do
 not
 hold
 regulatory


responsibility
 and
 cap
 economic
 risk
 at


trivial
 sums
 which
 leaves
 the
 client
 to


absorb
 financial
 regulatory
 and
 legal


responsibility
 and
 responsibility
 is
 a


dimension
 that
 cannot
 be
 automated


because
 if
 AI
 resolves
 your
 divorce
 case


in
 a
 way
 that
 would
 make
 you
 give
 up
 all


of
 your
 life
 savings
 in
 favor
 of
 your


former
 partner,
 AI
 won't
 take


responsibility.


A
 lawyer
 will.
 If
 your
 business
 puts
 you


in
 the
 territory
 of
 financial
 fraud
 and


AI
 hasn't
 caught
 that
 while
 trying
 so


hard
 to
 flatter
 you,
 AI
 won't
 pay
 the


fine,
 but
 an
 accounting
 firm
 will.
 The


economics
 of
 responsibility
 extend
 far


beyond
 liability
 and
 malpractice


coverage.
 The
 one
 that
 is
 really


delicate
 is
 politics.
 The
 ability
 to


navigate
 politics
 and
 high
 stakes
 and


emotionally
 charged
 situations
 is
 the


biggest
 economic
 mode
 that
 professionals


have
 over
 AI.
 Now
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 our


divorce
 example.
 Apart
 from
 real
 estate,


custody,
 financial
 aspects,
 it
 is
 very


important
 to
 consider
 all
 of
 these


things
 within
 the
 context
 of
 family


politics,
 cultural
 sensitivities
 and


power
 dynamics
 within
 the
 same
 family.


Experienced
 family
 lawyers
 understand


generational
 hierarchies,
 cultural


taboss,
 family
 alliance
 patterns,


religious
 community
 pressures,
 and


cultural
 concepts
 of
 honor
 that
 AI


technically
 can
 learn,
 but
 it
 will
 not


predict
 or
 consider
 that
 within
 a
 larger


context
 reliably.
 The
 economic


consequences
 of
 mishandling
 these


dynamics
 isn't
 just
 legal
 or
 financial.


It's
 a
 family
 relationship
 destruction


and
 cultural
 alienation
 that
 can
 span


generations.
 On
 top
 of
 it,
 power


imbalances,
 subtle
 intimidation


patterns,
 financial
 abuse
 tactics,
 and


emotional
 manipulation.
 Lawyers


recognize
 when
 one
 spouse
 uses
 financial


complexity
 to
 maintain
 control
 or
 when


child
 custody
 becomes
 a
 weapon.
 AI
 on


the
 other
 hand
 cannot
 read
 micro


expressions
 on
 the
 spot
 or
 assess


informal
 undocumented
 power
 structures


or
 the
 highest
 paid
 person's
 opinion.


The
 cost
 of
 missing
 these
 signals
 is


continued
 abuse,
 financial
 harm,
 and


psychological
 damage
 worth
 millions
 in


long-term
 consequences.
 This
 is
 why


replace
 the
 professional
 business
 model


simply
 collapses
 because
 it's
 trying
 to


replace
 hours.
 But
 what
 you're
 paying


for
 are
 not
 the
 hours.
 It's
 the


responsibility.
 So
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


build
 a
 sustainable
 AI
 native
 business


based
 on
 automating
 professional


services
 within
 a
 foreseeable
 future
 and


have
 a
 working
 product
 that
 you
 can


actually
 start
 testing,
 you
 want
 to
 be


looking
 at
 the
 first
 bucket.
 And
 now


let's
 talk
 about
 how
 to
 build
 a


billion-dollar
 AI
 business.


You
 emerge
 100%
 of
 yourself
 in
 a


specialist's
 life
 and
 study
 their


day-to-day
 routine.
 You
 have
 to
 know


what
 they
 do
 so
 well
 that
 you
 can


basically
 become
 their
 shadow.
 And
 when


you're
 at
 a
 point
 when
 you're
 able
 to


map
 out
 their
 work
 step
 by
 step
 and
 draw


patterns
 from
 repetitive
 things
 that


they
 do,
 pick
 one
 step
 in
 this
 entire


thing.
 You
 pick
 one
 step
 when
 a
 client


is
 paying
 the
 most
 and
 the
 lawyer
 or


accountant
 or
 any
 other
 kind
 of


specialist
 is
 losing
 the
 most
 time
 by


doing
 this
 admin
 work.
 And
 then
 you
 try


and
 see
 if
 you
 can
 automate
 that.
 You


would
 be
 priming
 your
 product
 for
 a
 high


adoption
 from
 the
 very
 start
 because
 it


goes
 both
 ways.
 Your
 selling
 point
 for


the
 specialist
 is
 that
 they're
 going
 to


spend
 less
 time
 on
 this
 step
 and
 can


probably
 do
 more
 work
 faster
 and


therefore
 get
 more
 clients.
 And
 the


benefit
 for
 the
 client
 is
 that
 they
 get


results
 faster
 and
 with
 potential
 cost


savings.
 To
 do
 this,
 I
 suggest
 that
 you


really
 narrow
 down
 your
 scope.
 Narrow
 is


the
 moat.
 Automating
 difficult
 workflows


in
 legal
 tech
 comes
 with
 immense


business
 potential,
 especially
 when


targeting
 labor
 intensive
 or
 errorprone


tasks
 considered
 boring
 or
 extremely


challenging
 for
 AI.
 Automating
 even
 a


part
 of
 the
 step,
 a
 step
 that
 is
 plagued


by
 regulation
 and
 nuance,
 can
 bring
 you


a
 unicorn
 value
 business
 because
 you


would
 be
 saving
 for
 example
 law
 firms
 a


lot
 of
 money
 and
 enabling
 scaling
 at
 a


level
 that
 was
 not
 possible
 for
 them


with
 manual
 labor
 alone.
 But
 there
 is


one
 caveat
 and
 here
 is
 what
 I
 would


recommend
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 when
 assessing


an
 idea
 for
 an
 AI
 native
 business.
 Do


the
 math
 on
 how
 much
 it
 would
 cost
 to


outsource
 this
 work.
 If
 a
 specialist


needs
 help
 and
 they're
 choosing
 between


an
 app
 or
 an
 outsourced
 resource
 to


delegate
 to.
 How
 does
 your
 product


compare
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 impact
 it's


creating
 compared
 to
 an
 outsourced


human?
 Because
 if
 the
 process
 that


you're
 automating
 can
 be
 done
 by
 a


junior
 specialist,
 the
 value
 of
 your


product
 plummets
 because
 you
 don't
 have


a
 moat.
 Just
 like
 lots
 of
 GPT
 rappers


don't
 have
 a
 mode
 because
 if
 Google,


Anthropic
 or
 OpenAI
 introduce
 a
 native


product
 that
 will
 cover
 the
 use
 case


that
 the
 rapper
 is
 built
 around,
 your


product
 may
 not
 have
 a
 moat
 due
 to
 a


limited
 functionality
 that
 a
 cheaper


human
 can
 do.


And
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 throw
 two
 business


ideas,
 billiondoll
 business
 ideas
 at


you.
 One
 from
 the
 legal
 and
 one
 from
 the


finance
 space.
 And
 hopefully
 they
 will


be
 a
 good
 illustration
 of
 what
 I
 mean
 by


that
 one
 step
 that
 needs
 to
 be


automated.


For
 this
 example,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 thank


our
 subscriber.
 Her
 name
 is
 Christina.


She's
 a
 financial
 planning
 and
 analysis


professional
 based
 in
 New
 York
 who
 was


kind
 enough
 to
 help
 us
 with
 a
 concrete


example
 of
 an
 idea
 in
 the
 finance


industry.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much,


Christina.
 For
 context,
 R&D
 tax
 credit


documentation
 is
 the
 process
 of


paperwork
 and
 recordkeeping
 that
 you


must
 provide
 to
 the
 government
 to
 prove


that
 your
 company
 deserves
 money
 back


for
 doing
 research
 and
 development
 work.


Think
 of
 it
 this
 way.
 The
 government


wants
 to
 encourage
 companies
 to
 innovate


and
 build
 mind-blowing
 AI.
 So,
 they


offer
 a
 tax
 credit,
 basically
 a
 discount


on
 your
 taxes
 and
 even
 cash
 back.
 And
 it


offers
 it
 to
 companies
 that
 spend
 money


trying
 to
 solve
 technical
 problems.
 But


to
 get
 the
 money,
 you
 need
 to
 prove
 that


you
 actually
 did
 qualifying
 R&D
 work.
 To


prove
 this,
 companies
 spend
 between
 50


and
 $150,000
 a
 year
 on
 tax
 consultants


because
 documenting
 qualifying


activities,
 tracking
 employee
 time,
 and


maintaining
 audit
 trails
 is
 impossibly


complex
 when
 done
 manually.
 A
 simple
 use


case,
 your
 software
 company
 spends
 $2


million
 on
 engineer
 salaries,
 building
 a


new
 bleeding
 edge
 AI
 feature.
 The


government
 says,
 "Great.
 We'll
 give
 you


back
 6
 to
 10%
 of
 that
 spending
 as
 a
 tax


credit."
 So,
 you
 could
 get
 between
 $120


to
 $200,000
 back.
 Now,
 you
 need
 to


document
 and
 prove
 that
 your
 engineers


were
 actually
 solving
 technical


uncertainties.
 They
 experimented
 with


different
 approaches,
 and
 that
 the
 work


that
 they
 did
 involved
 real
 engineering


research.
 Let's
 do
 a
 quick
 estimation
 of


this
 business
 opportunity.
 The
 total


addressable
 market
 is
 comprised
 of


500,000
 plus
 companies
 in
 North
 America


conducting
 qualifying
 R&D
 activities.


200,000
 of
 those
 companies
 currently


claim
 R&D
 credits
 and
 they
 spend
 $15


billion
 annually
 on
 consulting
 services.


300,000
 companies
 are
 eligible,
 but
 they


don't
 proceed
 with
 R&D
 tax
 credit


because
 the
 documentation
 is
 very


complex.
 The
 R&D
 tax
 credit
 market
 is


valued
 at
 $5.2
 2
 billion
 in
 2024
 and


projected
 to
 grow
 to
 9.1
 billion
 by


2033.
 North
 American
 market
 takes
 up


about
 60%
 of
 this
 market.
 And
 here
 are


some
 automation
 opportunities
 in
 this


space.
 Number
 one,
 companies
 must


reconstruct
 retrospectively
 which


employees
 worked
 on
 qualifying
 R&D


projects
 and
 how
 many
 hours
 were
 spent.


Currently,
 this
 is
 being
 done
 manually.


Number
 two,
 companies
 must
 correlate


payroll
 costs,
 cloud
 computing
 expenses,


materials,
 and
 contractor
 payments
 to


specific
 R&D
 projects.
 This
 cost


companies
 between
 10
 and
 $25,000


annually
 in
 accounting
 and
 consultant


time.
 This
 is
 currently
 being
 done


manually.
 The
 CRA
 and
 IRS
 require


comprehensive
 audit
 trails
 with
 proper


documentation.
 This
 costs
 companies


between
 5
 and
 $15,000
 annually
 in


administrative
 fees.
 This
 is
 also
 being


done
 manually.
 Going
 back
 to
 my


suggestion,
 with
 one
 step,
 solve
 one
 of


these
 and
 there's
 your
 billion-dollar
 AI


business.
 Want

Example
 number
 two,


automation
 for
 intellectual
 property


litigations.
 For
 this
 one,
 I'm
 going
 to


start
 with
 an
 example.
 Imagine
 that


Apple
 sues
 Google,
 claiming
 that
 the


Pixel
 phones
 infringe
 Apple's
 slide
 to


unlock
 patent.
 To
 defend
 themselves,


Google's
 lawyers
 must
 analyze
 the


prosecution
 history
 of
 Apple's
 patent
 to


find
 weaknesses.
 In
 this
 context,
 patent


prosecution
 history
 is
 the
 detailed


review
 of
 every
 document
 creating
 during


a
 patent's
 journey
 through
 the
 US
 patent


and
 trademark
 office
 from
 initial


application
 to
 final
 grant.
 This


includes
 all
 office
 actions,
 claim


amendments,
 examiner
 reviews,
 applicant


responses
 that
 show
 how
 the
 patent


evolved,
 and
 what
 arguments
 were
 made
 to


secure
 approval.
 What
 Google's
 lawyers


need
 to
 discover
 is
 whether
 Apple
 has


originally
 claimed
 something
 broader


during
 prosecution
 and
 then
 narrowed
 it


down.
 What
 prior
 art
 did
 the
 examiner


site
 that
 forced
 Apple
 to
 amend
 their


claims?
 Did
 Apple
 make
 any
 statements


during
 prosecution
 that
 limit
 how


broadly
 the
 patent
 can
 be
 interpreted?


Are
 there
 any
 inconsistencies
 between


what
 Apple
 argued
 to
 have
 as
 part
 of
 the


patent
 and
 what
 they're
 claiming
 in
 the


lawsuit
 against
 Google?
 A

 and
 essentially
 any


information
 that
 was

public
 before
 the
 inventor

 Another
 area
 is

 And

 American


enterprise
 world
 is
 full
 of
 examples


like
 these.
 And
 the
 rule
 of
 thumb
 is


that
 you
 should
 go
 for
 industries
 where


work
 isn't
 just
 tasks.
 Any
 occupation


that
 involves
 consulting
 in
 various


capacities
 such
 as
 negotiation,


strategizing,
 long-term
 planning
 that


involves
 risk.
 I've
 said
 this
 before
 and


I'll
 say
 it
 again.
 The
 best
 examples
 are


boring,
 traditional,
 classic,
 regulated


industries,
 finance,
 healthcare,


accounting,
 legal,
 and
 stick
 to
 these


rules.
 Pick
 a
 boring
 traditional


industry.
 You
 can
 either
 find
 someone


who
 has
 spent
 decades
 working
 in
 it,
 or


you
 can
 go
 to
 that
 industry
 and
 work
 in


it
 yourself.
 Usually,
 the
 best
 founders


are
 the
 ones
 who
 actually
 tried
 working


in
 the
 industry
 for
 a
 while.
 Focus
 on


making
 expensive
 professionals
 more


efficient
 and
 narrow
 down
 your
 focus.
 Do


not
 underestimate
 the
 nuance
 and


regulation
 that
 goes
 into
 their
 job


thinking
 that
 you
 can
 automate
 it
 all


only
 because
 the
 industry
 is
 textbased.


Sure,
 laws
 are
 textbased
 and
 in
 the


legal
 process
 everything
 gets


documented.
 But
 even
 before
 we
 get
 to


the
 notion
 of
 regulations,
 check
 your


assumptions.
 For
 example,
 the


assumptions
 around
 how
 much
 data
 is


publicly
 available
 to
 train
 your
 model.


In
 fact,
 my
 close
 friend
 does
 audio


transcriptions
 for
 a
 court
 and
 that


industry
 is
 not
 dying.
 In
 the
 age
 when


any
 video
 or
 audio
 AI
 software
 records,


transcribes
 and
 connects
 to
 various


agendic
 workflows,
 the
 courts
 are
 not


allowed
 to
 use
 those
 apps
 due
 to
 privacy


reasons.
 Automate
 small
 routine


workflows,
 not
 core
 accountability,


responsibility
 or
 skills
 that
 require


high
 emotional
 intelligence
 such
 as


corporate
 politics.
 Hours
 are
 easy
 to


automate.
 consequence
 and
 responsibility


aren't.
 That
 is
 why
 $500
 an
 hour
 beats


$20
 a
 month.
 To
 build
 a
 profitable


product,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 automate
 the


entire
 job.
 You
 need
 one
 narrow,


highstake
 step
 that
 sits
 beside


accountability.
 Own
 that
 step
 and
 build


a
 product
 that
 solves
 that
 step
 from
 end


to
 end.
 Do
 that
 and
 the
 margins
 will


follow.
 We
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 We'll


see
 you
 next
 time.
