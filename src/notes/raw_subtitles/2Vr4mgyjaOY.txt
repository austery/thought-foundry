hey
 this
 is
 Daria
 and
 today
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about


networking
 on
 this
 channel
 we're


discussing
 all
 things
 Tech
 Career


Development
 in
 Tech
 and
 Tech
 news
 I'm
 a


product
 manager
 I've
 been
 working
 in


tech
 for
 the
 past
 8
 years
 and
 if
 you
 are


in
 Tech
 or
 want
 to
 get
 into
 Tech
 you


have
 probably
 heard
 about
 layoffs
 every


time
 I
 go
 in
 LinkedIn
 since
 early
 2023
 I


see
 at
 least
 one
 person
 from
 my
 network


announcing
 that
 they
 got
 laid
 off
 and


that
 they're
 asking
 for
 help
 from
 their


Network
 naturally
 I
 started
 thinking


about
 a
 scenario
 what
 would
 I
 do
 if
 I


were
 to
 get
 laid
 off
 thankfully
 my


company
 has
 been
 very
 stable
 and
 safe


I'm
 not
 worried
 about
 that
 we
 haven't


had
 any
 Mass
 layoffs
 but
 I
 see
 what's


happening
 around
 me
 and
 it
 is
 quite


concerning
 so
 I
 started
 asking
 myself


who
 would
 I
 call
 if
 it
 were
 to
 happen
 to


me
 I
 have
 a
 decent
 number
 of
 contacts
 on


LinkedIn
 and
 I
 always
 thought
 that
 I
 had


a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 I
 could
 connect


with
 professionally
 and
 seek
 help
 if
 I


needed
 to
 so
 I
 went
 into
 my
 LinkedIn


started
 scrolling
 through
 the
 contacts


and
 seeing
 what
 the
 people
 that
 I
 would


reach
 out
 to
 are
 up
 to
 these
 days
 first


thing
 that
 caught
 my
 attention
 was
 that


some
 of
 my
 former
 bosses
 and
 colleagues


were
 laid
 off
 as
 well
 some
 of
 them
 still


searching
 for
 a
 job
 the
 second
 thing
 the


people
 who
 remained
 where
 they
 were
 when


I
 met
 them
 the
 companies
 are
 simply
 not


hiring
 or
 at
 least
 not
 the
 product
 roles


so
 if
 I
 were
 to
 look
 for
 a
 job
 today
 and


reach
 out
 to
 those
 people
 they'd


probably
 be
 willing
 to
 help
 but
 their


companies
 are
 not
 hiring
 right
 now
 and


just
 a
 quick
 reference
 to
 my
 first
 video


on
 YouTube
 that
 I
 published
 the
 worst


tech
 jobs
 to
 get
 into
 product
 management


was
 one
 of
 the
 jobs
 that
 I
 specified


there
 because
 as
 I
 said
 the
 structure
 of


the
 development
 team
 is
 such
 that
 there


is
 usually
 1
 pm.
 per
 one
 team
 or


sometimes
 even
 1
 p.m.
 per
 two


development
 teams
 so
 it
 is
 quite
 normal


for
 companies
 not
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 a


ton
 of
 PMs
 and
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 that


about
 10%
 of
 people
 who
 could
 become
 my


potential
 leads
 have
 actually
 switched


careers
 entirely
 so
 the
 best
 thing
 they


could
 do
 is
 perhaps
 help
 me
 with
 a


referral
 and
 by
 the
 way
 I
 think
 that


referrals
 are
 extremely
 overrated
 I


think
 they
 help
 you
 a
 tiny
 little
 bit


but
 unless
 that
 referral
 is
 going
 to
 the


hiring
 manager
 and
 the
 person
 referring


you
 knows
 the
 hiring
 manager
 can
 put
 in


a
 good
 word
 for
 you
 I
 don't
 think
 that


referral
 is
 going
 to
 help
 you
 much
 one


last
 thing
 I
 would
 not
 consider
 cold


applying
 on
 LinkedIn
 as
 my
 main
 search


tactic
 in
 2024
 2025
 as
 far
 as
 I
 remember


according
 to
 the
 recent
 data
 I'll
 check


either
 the
 response
 rate
 or
 the
 offer


rate
 is
 actually
 1%
 from
 cold
 applying


so
 to
 me
 cold
 applying
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a


wasted
 effort
 I
 would
 probably
 still
 do


it
 like
 5
 to
 10
 minutes
 a
 day
 but
 I


would
 not
 be
 counting
 on
 cold


applications
 at
 least
 not
 right
 now


which
 brings
 me
 to
 my
 point
 how
 do
 you


find
 a
 job
 and
 recover
 from
 a
 layoff


fairly
 quickly
 if
 you
 were
 to
 lose
 a
 job


right
 now
 or
 if
 you
 already
 lost
 your


job
 of
 people
 I
 know
 the
 ones
 who
 were


able
 to
 recover
 quickly
 were
 usually
 the


people
 who
 who
 had
 a
 very
 strong
 Network


and
 were
 able
 to
 land
 their
 offers
 and


were
 able
 to
 land
 solid
 offers
 through


their
 Network
 so
 how
 do
 you
 build
 a


network
 that
 can
 help
 you
 when
 you
 need


it
 the
 most
 so
 just
 a
 quick
 fact
 about


me
 I
 had
 never
 been
 big
 on
 building


Network
 until
 late
 2023
 I
 would
 consider


myself
 an
 introvert
 or
 an
 ambt
 I
 love


people
 I
 like
 helping
 people
 but
 I'm


just
 I'm
 not
 a
 very
 social
 type
 of
 a


person
 I
 don't
 like
 loud
 places
 I
 don't


like
 parties
 very
 much
 and
 it
 is
 really


unnatural
 for
 me
 to
 put
 myself
 in
 a


group
 of
 strangers
 walking
 around
 and


making
 connections
 and
 adding
 them
 in


LinkedIn
 hoping
 that
 they
 would
 help
 me


or
 that
 I
 could
 help
 them
 in
 the
 future


I
 always
 considered
 that
 nature
 of


relationship
 to
 be
 very
 transactional


and
 I
 always
 tell
 myself
 well
 I'm
 not


that
 I
 appreciate
 deep
 meaningful


conversations
 I
 am
 not
 the
 one
 who's


going
 to
 be
 jumping
 from
 one
 group
 to


another
 just
 introducing
 myself
 pitching


myself
 and
 then
 leaving
 the
 event
 but


then
 again
 when
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the


list
 of
 my
 lingin
 connections
 I
 realized


that
 if
 something
 were
 to
 happen
 to
 my


career
 today
 and
 if
 I
 were
 to
 lose
 my


job
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 I


could
 reach
 out
 to
 who
 could
 help
 me


with
 a
 job
 fairly
 fast
 let
 alone


thinking
 about
 the
 long-term
 strategy


for
 your
 career
 finding
 a
 mentor
 finding


someone
 who
 can
 help
 you
 build
 a
 very


logical
 career
 path
 that
 will
 lead
 you


to
 success
 in
 a
 fairly
 short
 period
 of


time
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 network
 I
 did


not
 know
 how
 to
 even
 start
 a


conversation
 what
 to
 ask
 how
 to
 join
 a


little
 group
 which
 events
 to
 go
 to
 so
 on


and
 so
 forth
 so
 I
 want
 to
 share
 all
 the


lessons
 that
 I
 learned
 from
 my


networking
 Journey
 since
 late
 2023


because
 I
 think
 it
 has
 been
 quite


successful
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 make


approximately
 200
 highquality


connections
 on
 LinkedIn
 since
 late
 2023


as
 I've
 been
 putting
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 into


my
 networking
 strategy
 and
 if
 that


number
 doesn't
 sound
 too
 big
 it's
 just


200
 I
 personally
 think
 that
 that
 is


actually
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 I
 thought
 I


would
 make
 in
 just
 one
 year
 because
 it


is
 200
 real
 people
 that
 I
 built


relationship
 a
 certain
 level
 of


relationship
 with
 that
 I
 can
 comfortably


reach
 out
 to
 and
 I
 know
 they
 will


respond
 and
 I
 know
 that
 they
 could


potentially
 help
 me
 I
 can
 help
 them
 when


they
 need
 me
 and
 they
 can
 help
 me
 when
 I


need
 them
 so
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 contact
 on


LinkedIn
 the
 number
 of
 contacts
 you
 have


on
 LinkedIn
 does
 not
 equal
 the
 number
 of


high
 quality
 contacts
 you
 can
 reach
 out


to
 when
 you
 need
 it
 I
 feel
 very
 good


about
 that
 number
 so
 I
 want
 to
 share


some
 of
 the
 tips
 that
 I
 learned
 along


the
 way
 that
 could
 help
 you
 build
 a


highquality
 network
 in
 a
 fairly
 short


period
 of
 time
 coming
 from
 somebody
 who


had
 never
 done
 networking
 before
 was


incredibly
 scared
 and
 uncomfortable


starting
 a
 conversation
 with
 a
 stranger


and
 especially
 asking
 them
 for
 a
 favor


so
 tip
 number
 one
 know
 that
 everybody
 is


scared
 when
 they
 start
 doing
 it
 for
 the


first
 time
 but
 trust
 me
 after
 three
 or


four
 networking
 events
 you're
 going
 to


go
 to
 you
 will
 get
 very
 comfortable


talking
 to
 strangers
 it's
 just
 that


barrier
 that
 you
 have
 to
 overcome
 I


don't
 have
 any
 tips
 for
 you
 as
 to
 how


you
 can
 suppress
 that
 fear
 I
 don't
 think


you
 can
 you
 just
 take
 that
 fear
 with
 you


and
 you
 go
 you
 have
 to
 make
 that
 first


step
 it
 is
 probably
 comparable
 to
 dating


when
 you
 go
 in
 a
 first
 date
 everybody


scar
 sced
 but
 you
 just
 you
 just
 have
 to


do
 it
 this
 is
 very
 similar
 you're
 not


alone
 Everybody's
 scared
 if
 that
 makes


you
 feel
 better
 then
 there's
 that
 number


two
 don't
 be
 afraid
 to
 get
 ignored


because
 you
 won't
 get
 ignored
 people
 who


gather
 for
 professional
 events
 everybody


understands
 that
 they're
 there
 to


network
 I
 have
 never
 met
 anyone
 who


would
 be
 just
 outright
 rude
 to
 me
 and
 if


I
 were
 to
 approach
 them
 they'd
 be
 like


no
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 never


happened
 to
 me
 never
 happened
 to
 anyone


I
 know
 I
 think
 it
 really
 comes
 from
 a


very
 primal
 fear
 of
 being
 rejected
 and


I'm
 not
 a
 psychologist
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


talk
 about
 the
 fears
 that
 we
 all
 have


but
 I
 remember
 being
 scared
 of
 being


rejected
 when
 I
 was
 was
 first
 going
 into


those
 events
 I
 thought
 nobody
 would
 want


to
 talk
 to
 me
 nobody
 would
 want
 to


listen
 to
 what
 I
 had
 to
 say
 why
 would


they
 even
 talk
 to
 me
 I
 have
 nothing


interesting
 to
 say
 I
 have
 nothing


interesting
 to
 share
 so
 just
 know
 that


that
 is
 not
 the
 case
 you
 will
 not
 get


ignored
 and
 it
 could
 be
 because
 people


are
 polite
 but
 I
 don't
 really
 care
 that


other
 people
 are
 being
 polite
 or
 not


even
 if
 they're
 not
 ignoring
 you
 just


out
 of
 politeness
 that's
 all
 you
 need


you
 need
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 that
 fear
 and
 if


it
 comes
 from
 somebody
 who
 is
 talking
 to


you
 just
 because
 they're
 being
 polite
 so


be
 it
 the
 first
 couple
 of
 times
 not
 a


problem
 as
 long
 as
 you
 talk
 to
 somebody


number
 three
 do
 not
 feel
 bad
 about
 being


transactional
 everybody
 is
 there
 to
 make


good
 connections
 and
 introducing


yourself
 to
 somebody
 in
 order
 to


exchange
 some
 information
 or
 connect


with
 them
 about
 a
 potential
 job
 those


people
 are
 doing
 the
 exact
 same
 thing


maybe
 they're
 not
 talking
 to
 you
 about


those
 things
 but
 they're
 definitely


talking
 about
 it
 to
 someone
 who
 stands


right
 behind
 your
 back
 number
 four
 how


do
 you
 actually
 start
 a
 conversation


with
 a
 stranger
 let's
 imagine
 that
 you


are
 at
 a
 networking
 event
 you're
 getting


into
 a
 room
 full
 of
 people
 you
 see
 those


little
 groups
 and
 you're
 probably


thinking
 what
 do
 I
 even
 say
 how
 do
 I
 get


into
 at
 least
 one
 of
 those
 groups
 what


if
 I
 interrupt
 what
 if
 they
 find
 me


boring
 this
 is
 actually
 very
 easy
 you


quite
 literally
 come
 up
 to
 that
 group


usually
 maybe
 not
 every
 single
 group
 but


a
 lot
 of
 those
 groups
 have
 little


openings
 get
 into
 that
 opening
 people


start
 noticing
 you
 and
 instead
 of
 being


awkwardly
 silent
 where
 you
 just
 like


standing
 and
 staring
 at
 them
 waiting
 for


them
 to
 say
 something
 and
 it's
 just


awkward
 you
 go
 hey
 guys
 may
 I
 please


join
 you
 that's
 it
 or
 you
 can
 also
 say


hey
 guys
 I
 over
 heard
 you
 talk
 about
 ex


I'm
 really
 interested
 in
 that
 topic
 may


I
 please
 join
 your
 conversation
 that
 way


you're
 not
 really
 interrupting
 anybody


because
 you're
 asking
 for
 permission
 to


join
 you're
 being
 respectful
 while


getting
 what
 you
 want
 and
 what
 do
 you


think
 they're
 going
 to
 say
 no
 you


can't
 people
 who
 enter
 conversations
 and


look
 really
 awkward
 and
 are
 usually
 the


ones
 that
 others
 do
 not
 want
 to
 talk
 to


but
 still
 do
 because
 they
 being
 polite


are
 the
 ones
 who
 just
 step
 into
 the


circle
 and
 don't
 say
 a
 word
 that's
 when


it
 gets
 awkward
 because
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 if
 you
 are
 actually
 part
 of


that
 group
 and
 you
 see
 a
 stranger
 who


just
 entered
 the
 conversation
 and
 is


just
 standing
 there
 staring
 at
 you


you're
 waiting
 for
 them
 to
 say
 something


to
 at
 least
 introduce
 themselves
 I


realize
 that
 the
 best
 strategy
 is
 to


enter
 a
 group
 with
 a
 question
 when


you're
 asking
 them
 for
 permission
 to
 let


you
 in
 people
 feel
 like
 you're
 you


acknowledge
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 were


there
 before
 you
 you
 introduce
 yourself


and
 now
 you're
 part
 of
 the
 group
 number


five
 when
 to
 show
 up
 to
 a
 networking


event
 this
 may
 be
 a
 little
 bit


controversial
 but
 I
 find
 if
 you
 think


about
 it
 networking
 event
 there
 are
 two


points
 in
 every
 event
 where
 you
 would


get
 the
 most
 value
 out
 of
 it
 if
 you


enter
 one
 of
 those
 two
 points
 number
 one


if
 you
 show
 up
 at
 the
 very
 beginning
 and


I
 actually
 think
 that
 it's
 quite


efficient
 if
 you
 know
 the
 attendees
 and


if
 perhaps
 you've
 been
 eyeing
 somebody


you
 know
 the
 person
 or
 you
 have
 heard
 of


the
 person
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 at
 that


event
 and
 you
 just
 want
 to
 be
 there
 in


advance
 to
 perhaps
 catch
 them
 as
 early


as
 possible
 and
 and
 have
 an
 opportunity


at
 a
 oneone
 chat
 I
 have
 done
 that
 when
 I


personally
 go
 to
 professional
 events
 I


look
 at
 who's
 going
 to
 show
 up
 and
 if


there's
 somebody
 I'm
 really
 interested


in
 I
 would
 make
 sure
 to
 show
 up
 and
 I'd


be
 very
 open
 about
 it
 I'm
 not
 a
 stalker


I'm
 very
 open
 about
 it
 I'd
 say
 something


like
 hi
 I'm
 Daria
 I
 noticed
 your
 name
 in


the
 list
 of
 attendees
 and
 I
 just
 really


wanted
 to
 have
 a
 conversation
 with
 you


because
 I
 noticed
 on
 your
 LinkedIn
 that


you
 did
 ABC
 or
 you
 work
 at
 ABC
 and
 I


really
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 something
 I've


been
 looking
 forward
 to
 seeing
 you
 at


the
 event
 because
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 can


connect
 about
 something
 something
 along


those
 lines
 I
 feel
 like
 when
 you're


being
 really
 honest
 and
 sincere
 about


your
 intentions
 and
 rather
 than
 coming


up
 and
 pitching
 yourself
 to
 somebody


very
 aggressively
 being
 transparent
 and


sincere
 about
 your
 intentions
 people
 are


very
 much
 inclined
 to
 respond
 to
 you
 and


be
 friendly
 with
 you
 really
 and
 the


second
 point
 is
 actually
 quite
 late
 so


let's
 say
 the
 event
 starts
 at
 7:00
 so


typically
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 the


culture
 is
 in
 different
 parts
 of
 the


world
 but
 like
 in
 Canada
 for
 example
 not


a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 show
 up
 at


7:00
 most
 will
 probably
 come
 at
 like


7:15
 to
 7:20
 so
 what
 I
 would
 do
 if
 I


know
 that
 I'm
 running
 late
 instead
 of


rushing
 and
 trying
 to
 get
 there
 by
 7:00


when
 I
 know
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


I
 would
 rather
 take
 my
 time
 and
 arrive


at
 7:50
 it's
 not
 a
 rule
 or
 anything
 it's


just
 something
 that
 I
 personally
 find


efficient
 most
 people
 show
 up
 at
 7
 7:15


or
 720
 and
 they
 start
 making
 kind
 of


their
 rounds
 and
 talking
 to
 people
 who


are
 at
 the
 event
 again
 it
 also
 depends


on
 the
 size
 of
 the
 event
 I'm
 not
 talking


about
 big
 text
 Summits
 or
 conferences
 if


it's
 a
 fairly
 small
 networking
 event


happening
 locally
 within
 40
 minutes
 by


7:50
 it's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 describe
 but


it's
 a
 point
 where
 most
 people
 have


already
 met
 each
 other
 and
 now
 they're


kind
 of
 struggling
 to
 find
 what
 to
 talk


about
 of
 course
 there
 will
 be
 some


groups
 where
 the
 conversation
 would
 be


very
 active
 but
 in
 my
 experience
 that


like
 about
 50
 minutes
 after
 the
 start
 or


about
 an
 hour
 after
 the
 start
 that's


when
 people
 are
 like
 okay
 what
 else
 do
 I


do
 what
 else
 do
 do
 I
 go
 who
 else
 can
 I


talk
 to
 like
 they're
 looking
 for


something
 fresh
 and
 new
 CU
 they've
 been


talking
 to
 either
 the
 same
 group
 or
 the


same
 number
 of
 groups
 for
 a
 certain


period
 of
 time
 by
 that
 point
 I
 find
 it


really
 efficient
 when
 you
 enter
 the


group
 at
 that
 time
 because
 you
 are
 going


to
 be
 that
 fresh
 meat
 and
 they're
 like


oh
 someone
 new
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 them
 as


well
 so
 that
 is
 again
 an
 observation
 and


it
 worked
 for
 me
 so
 I
 personally


recommend
 it
 as
 a
 tip
 tip
 number
 six
 I


think
 how
 to
 choose
 a
 networking
 event


when
 you're
 just
 starting
 to
 network
 I


recommend
 that
 you
 go
 to
 as
 many
 events


as
 possible
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 point


where
 you'll
 understand
 the
 kind
 of


events
 that
 you
 will
 not
 want
 to
 attend


anymore
 again
 sounds
 pretty
 obvious
 with


me
 personally
 it
 was
 actually
 quite


unexpected
 cuz
 there
 was
 a
 group
 that
 I


joined
 for
 product
 managers
 and
 I


thought
 that
 that
 would
 be
 a
 great
 group


for
 me
 specifically
 because
 I
 am
 in


product
 but
 I
 actually
 stopped
 going
 to


their
 events
 after
 the
 third
 event
 and


the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 because
 they


typically
 we
 have
 a
 very
 hyped
 topic


like
 how
 to
 build
 AI
 native
 products


like
 something
 along
 those
 lines


something
 that
 they
 know
 people
 are


interested
 in
 and
 they
 would
 have
 a


30-minute
 lecture
 and
 they
 would


typically
 invite
 a
 director
 or
 a
 VP
 from


a
 tech
 company
 and
 those
 people
 would


give
 a
 half
 an
 hour
 lecture
 about
 a


topic
 it
 would
 be
 incredibly
 high
 level


the
 Q&A
 part
 is
 just
 miserable
 because


they're
 not
 really
 answering
 the


questions
 the
 questions
 that
 are
 being


asked
 are
 quite
 deep
 because
 people
 want


to
 know
 more
 they
 want
 to
 learn
 from


them
 but
 because
 they
 have
 30
 or
 40


minutes
 the
 answers
 aren't
 really
 very


helpful
 and
 then
 after
 that
 you
 have
 a


room
 full
 of
 PMS
 who
 went
 there
 because


of
 the
 overhyped
 topic
 and
 those
 people


aren't
 really
 specialists
 in
 that
 topic


so
 it's
 not
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 NW


workking
 with
 subject
 matter
 experts
 and


the
 executives
 who
 were
 presenting
 the


lecture
 would
 actually
 leave
 right
 after


the
 presentation
 so
 in
 my
 experience


those
 events
 were
 not
 helpful
 to
 me
 at


all
 there
 would
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 of
 people


that
 are
 just
 trying
 to
 get
 into
 the


industry
 who
 only
 want
 to
 get
 something


from
 you
 I
 stopped
 attending
 after
 the


third
 event
 to
 sum
 it
 up
 if
 you're
 just


starting
 go
 to
 every
 single
 possible


event
 that
 you
 can
 get
 into
 over
 time


limit
 your
 choice
 to
 events
 that
 are


really
 valuable
 and
 the
 ones
 that
 are


not
 just
 based
 on
 topics
 that
 are
 just


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 hype
 so
 that
 was
 a
 now


B
 closed
 groups
 paid
 groups
 smaller


venues
 Community
 Based
 and
 smaller


ticketed
 events
 events
 those
 are
 my


favorite
 as
 I
 also
 mentioned
 in
 my
 first


video
 there
 is
 a
 barrier
 to
 entry
 my


absolute
 favorite
 is
 Lenny
 ritky
 PM


Community
 Lenny
 is
 by
 far
 my
 favorite


product
 management
 Creator
 on
 LinkedIn


his
 substack
 and
 his
 podcast
 probably


the
 biggest
 thing
 that
 I
 appreciate


about
 him
 is
 that
 he
 has
 a
 closed


community
 for
 the
 newsletter
 subscribers


it
 is
 only
 available
 to
 people
 who
 pay


for
 the
 subscription
 and
 then
 they
 add


you
 to
 a
 slack
 Channel
 where
 people
 can


meet
 organize
 events
 and
 connect
 every


city
 I
 travel
 to
 just
 for
 leisure
 as
 a


tourist
 if
 I
 can
 attend
 Lenny's
 event
 I


do
 it
 I
 did
 it
 in
 Denmark
 I
 did
 it
 in


the
 US
 in
 multiple
 cities
 in
 the
 US
 I


did
 it
 in
 Germany
 I
 did
 it
 in
 Sweden
 and


I'm
 doing
 it
 very
 actively
 in
 Toronto


and
 the
 quality
 of
 people
 that
 this


community
 has
 is
 just
 outstanding
 it
 is


hands
 down
 my
 favorite
 community
 of
 all


every
 event
 you
 show
 up
 to
 you're
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 find
 someone
 really
 Val


valuable
 I've
 met
 friends
 I've
 met
 very


good
 contacts
 through
 his
 Network
 Lenny


himself
 through
 his
 content
 does
 a
 lot


of
 research
 around
 product
 management


product
 L
 companies
 how
 certain
 products


become
 viral
 what's
 kind
 of
 the


mechanism
 behind
 every
 single
 one
 of


them
 Career
 Development
 things
 like
 that


so
 I
 find
 that
 the
 people
 that
 you
 meet


at
 Lenny's
 events
 are
 really
 nerdy
 but


in
 a
 very
 good
 way
 can
 have
 a
 very


meaningful
 and
 productive
 conversation


with
 probably
 the
 entire
 group
 when
 you


go
 if
 you're
 in
 product
 I
 highly


recommend
 Lenny's
 Community
 number
 seven


what
 do
 you
 do
 if
 you
 are
 an
 early


career
 professional
 I
 would
 say
 that
 you


should
 concentrate
 on
 intermediate
 to


senior
 people
 within
 the
 community
 that


you're
 about
 to
 meet
 so
 for
 example
 if


you're
 a
 junior
 product
 manager
 I
 highly


recommend
 that
 you
 network
 the
 most
 with


intermediate
 and
 Senior
 PMS
 if
 your


primary
 goal
 is
 to
 find
 a
 job
 those
 are


the
 people
 that
 will
 be
 able
 to
 refer


you
 and
 recommend
 you
 to
 the
 hiring


manager
 if
 you're
 looking
 for
 advice
 in


your
 field
 or
 to
 get
 some
 feedback
 on


your
 work
 you
 can
 talk
 about
 that
 as


well
 and
 even
 though
 it
 may
 seem
 like


you
 don't
 have
 much
 to
 share
 and
 you're


just
 talking
 about
 your
 little
 things


while
 they
 know
 so
 much
 more
 than
 you


you
 will
 actually
 be
 surprised
 how
 much


people
 are
 willing
 to
 help
 because
 a
 lot


of
 PMS
 are
 going
 through
 similar


struggles
 and
 it's
 a
 great
 opportunity


for
 you
 to
 learn
 from
 their
 mistakes
 and


lastly
 don't
 feel
 like
 nobody
 is


interested
 in
 you
 because
 you're
 an


entry
 level
 specialist
 my
 biggest


realization
 from
 my
 networking
 Journey


is
 that
 often
 times
 you
 come
 to
 an
 event


and
 you
 think
 oh
 my
 God
 like
 I'm
 I'm


such
 a
 nobody
 what
 am
 I
 even
 going
 to


say
 I
 remember
 being
 at
 this
 event
 in


New
 York
 and
 the
 majority
 of
 PMS
 were


Fang
 PMS
 I
 work
 in
 a
 very
 big
 company


but
 it's
 not
 Fang
 I
 remember
 showing
 up


and
 thinking
 oh
 gosh
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 me
 and
 thinking


what
 are
 you
 even
 doing
 here
 it's
 funny


because
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 one
 of
 the


best
 events
 I've
 ever
 gone
 to
 people


would
 be
 so
 interested
 in
 talking
 to
 me


just
 because
 I
 was
 that
 fresh
 meat
 and


my
 biggest
 real
 realization
 was
 that
 in


my
 mind
 I
 was
 like
 they
 have
 nothing
 to


gain
 from
 me
 like
 I
 have
 nothing
 to
 give


them
 why
 would
 they
 even
 talk
 to
 me
 they


ended
 up
 being
 the
 nicest
 people
 I
 could


have
 ever
 hoped
 for
 tip
 number
 eight


what
 not
 to
 do
 please
 don't
 start
 the


conversation
 by
 pitching
 yourself
 to
 a


stranger
 I
 see
 plenty
 of
 career
 coaches


in
 LinkedIn
 actually
 encouraging
 people


to
 do
 that
 starting
 a
 conversation


saying
 I'm
 so
 and
 so
 and
 I'm
 doing
 this


and
 that
 just
 bluntly
 pitching
 yourself


to
 a
 person
 in
 front
 of
 you
 I
 I
 also


feel
 like
 this
 is
 a
 common
 mistake
 for


beginners
 because
 often
 times
 they're


simply
 too
 awkward
 and
 they
 don't
 know


what
 to
 say
 so
 they're
 just
 trying
 to


fill
 in
 that
 Silence
 with
 something
 and


they
 talk
 about
 themselves
 just
 to
 be


like
 you
 know
 hey
 I'm
 worthy
 of
 being


here
 like
 I
 have
 something
 to
 say
 listen


to
 me
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 because
 the


person
 is
 bragging
 or
 anything
 sometimes


it's
 just
 really
 because
 they're
 awkward


they
 don't
 know
 what
 else
 to
 say
 but
 if


you
 think
 about
 it
 from
 the
 person
 who's


listening
 to
 you
 from
 their
 perspective


imagine
 if
 you
 were
 the
 one
 listening
 to


that
 pitch
 from
 somebody
 when
 you
 hear


that
 you
 really
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 do


about
 it
 you're
 like
 yeah
 okay
 you've


done
 this
 and
 that
 and
 you're
 so


knowledgeable
 and
 smart
 and
 and
 and


experienced
 okay
 cool
 how
 can
 I
 help
 you


what
 what
 can
 I
 do
 for
 you
 like
 you


really
 don't
 know
 where
 to
 take
 that


conversation
 and
 it
 becomes
 really


awkward
 so
 I
 highly
 encourage
 you
 to
 be


very
 organic
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 building
 a


relationship
 with
 people
 professionally


your
 openness
 and
 sincereness
 is


actually
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 lot
 more


opportunity
 to
 create
 a
 connection
 uh


with
 people
 a
 lot
 faster
 with
 my
 last


tip
 I
 want
 to
 emphasize
 the
 importance


of
 networking
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 believe


me
 I
 encourage
 you
 to
 talk
 to
 people


around
 you
 that
 are
 a
 lot
 more


successful
 than
 you
 and
 who
 have
 a
 lot


more
 zeros
 in
 their
 bank
 accounts
 if


they
 open
 up
 to
 you
 and
 tell
 you
 about


their
 career
 journey
 I
 can
 put
 money
 on


the
 fact
 that
 the
 success
 that
 they
 got


to
 was
 probably
 due
 to
 not
 only
 their


skills
 and
 talent
 and
 hard
 work
 but
 also


very
 strategic
 and
 highquality


networking


networking
 makes
 you
 future
 proof


networking
 takes
 time
 I
 highly
 encourage


you
 to
 do
 it
 continuously
 you
 don't
 want


to
 be
 in
 a
 situation
 when
 you
 start


doing
 it
 when
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 about


to
 be
 laid
 off
 you
 want
 to
 be
 networking


continuously
 because
 those
 relationships


those
 coffee
 chats
 those
 that
 organic


relationship
 building
 it
 truly
 takes


time
 for
 people
 to
 trust
 you
 and
 be
 able


to
 refer
 you
 and
 be
 able
 to
 hire
 you


confidently
 they
 need
 time
 to
 get
 to


know
 you
 if
 you're
 thinking
 about


networking
 when
 you
 have
 already
 been


laid
 off
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 late


better
 late
 than
 never
 but
 if
 you
 are
 in


a
 position
 right
 now
 where
 you're
 not


worried
 about
 losing
 your
 job
 get
 into


networking
 so
 that
 you
 can
 have
 that


peace
 of
 mind
 going
 forward
 and
 you're


not
 going
 to
 start
 panicking
 if


something
 were
 to
 happen
 to
 your
 current


job
 if
 you
 have
 any
 strategies
 that
 made


a
 massive
 difference
 in
 your
 career
 that


I
 haven't
 covered
 today
 I
 would
 love
 to


hear
 from
 you
 please
 comment
 below
 for


now
 thank
 thanks
 for
 listening
 till
 next


time
 bye
