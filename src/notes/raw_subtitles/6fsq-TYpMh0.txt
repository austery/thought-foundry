 tune
 in
 to
 this
 short


version
 of
 the
 podcast
 which
 we
 do
 every


Friday
 for
 the
 long
 version
 tune
 in
 on


Wednesdays
 hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan


the
 CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund


and
 today
 we
 are
 thrilled
 to
 be
 joined


by
 Aden
 fredman
 CEO
 of


NASDAQ
 now
 Adina
 transformed
 NASDAQ
 into


a
 Global
 Tech
 Powerhouse
 and
 she's
 now


one
 of
 the
 most
 influential
 leaders
 in


global
 Finance
 so
 Aden
 welcome
 well
 it's


great
 to
 be
 here
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 nikai


and
 welcome
 to
 NASDAQ
 well
 exactly


because
 I'm
 visiting
 you
 so
 I'm
 sitting


here
 with
 a
 NASDAQ
 mug
 you
 know


kind
 of
 pretty
 pretty
 big
 but
 um
 would


you
 start
 with
 the
 basic
 so
 what
 is


NASDAQ
 sure
 well
 NASDAQ
 of
 course
 is
 a


world-class
 Market
 operator
 and
 we're


extremely
 extremely
 proud
 of
 that


Foundation
 yeah
 but
 as
 you
 know
 we
 have


expanded
 our
 business
 to
 become
 a
 global


technology
 provider
 to
 the
 financial


industry
 and
 we
 focused
 on
 expanding
 our


business
 in
 three
 key
 pillars
 and
 they


all
 are
 kind
 of
 form
 the
 foundation
 of
 a


good
 market
 so
 we've
 got
 our
 liquidity


pillar
 transparency
 and
 integrity
 and
 if


you
 think
 about
 it
 you
 need
 all
 three
 of


those
 things
 to
 make
 for
 a
 worldclass


capital
 Market
 but
 as
 we've
 kind
 of


become
 a
 technology
 provider
 and
 partner


to
 our
 clients
 we've
 used
 those
 themes


to
 really
 expand
 our
 business
 so
 you


know
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 shares
 in
 apple


Microsoft
 Amazon
 alphabet
 you
 basically


do
 it
 on
 ndaq
 but
 you
 also
 have
 a
 lot
 of


people
 in
 Sweden
 how
 come
 how
 come
 yes


in
 fact
 we
 own
 and
 operate
 the
 markets


in
 the
 nordics
 other
 than
 Norway
 um
 so


Sweden
 Denmark
 Finland
 Iceland
 and
 the


three
 Baltic
 countries
 we
 own
 an
 oper


those
 markets
 and
 we
 also
 have
 a
 market


technology
 business
 where
 we
 provide


technology
 to
 the
 world's
 markets
 so
 130


markets
 um
 rely
 on
 us
 for
 their


technology
 to
 run
 them
 to
 run
 their


markets
 and
 that's
 also
 operated
 out
 of


Sweden
 and
 why
 haven't
 you
 go
 Norway
 uh


that
 you
 know
 we
 wanted
 to
 have
 Norway


and
 why
 you
 probably
 remember
 well
 uh
 we


decided
 to
 take
 a
 friendly
 approach
 with


the
 Norwegian
 exchange
 and
 unfortunately


there's
 another
 exchange
 operator
 that


decided
 to
 take
 a
 less
 friendly
 approach


and
 they
 unfortunately
 won
 but
 we
 did


try
 very
 hard
 to
 come
 in
 as
 a
 friend
 as


a
 friendly
 partner
 to
 the
 Norwegian


exchange
 does
 each
 country
 need
 a
 so


exchange
 I
 would
 say
 in
 today's
 modern


Capital
 markets
 you
 know
 Capital
 flows


are
 Global
 money
 moves
 moves
 simly


around
 the
 world
 but
 there
 are
 very


local
 elements
 to
 exchanges
 where
 they


appeal
 to
 local
 innovators
 local
 market


participants
 local
 investors
 and
 so


there
 is
 a
 benefit
 to
 having
 a
 country


have
 its
 exchange
 but
 having
 it


connected
 into
 a
 global
 ecosystem
 to
 to


allow
 for
 more
 Capital
 flows
 is
 what
 we


think
 is
 the
 the
 future
 of
 markets
 if
 I


start
 up
 a
 company
 and
 it
 gets
 really


big
 are
 you
 going
 to
 call
 me
 and
 ask
 me


whether
 I
 want
 to
 list
 on
 NASDAQ
 well
 is


that
 how
 it
 works
 I
 personally
 start
 a


company
 and
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 get


really
 big
 we
 will
 call
 you
 up
 and
 ask


if
 you
 want
 to
 list
 on
 NASDAQ
 so
 we
 list


companies
 of
 all
 sizes
 on
 NASDAQ
 and


we're
 very
 happy
 to
 have
 a
 startup
 come


and
 earlier
 in
 their
 life
 and
 choose
 to


make
 their
 their
 stock
 available
 to
 you


know
 everyday
 consumers
 and
 everyday
 uh


retail
 investors
 and
 then
 grow
 up
 as
 a


company
 like
 you
 know
 when
 Amazon
 went


public
 many
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 decades


ago
 they
 were
 worth
 $300
 million
 and


they've
 grown
 up
 as
 a
 public
 company
 and


done
 remarkably
 well
 in
 the
 public


market
 du
 all
 their
 exchanges
 tried
 to


steal
 them
 away
 from
 you
 um
 you
 know
 it


used
 to
 be
 that
 there
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 view


that
 nasac
 was
 the
 home
 to
 smaller


companies
 but
 today
 nasc
 is
 home
 to
 the


largest
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 and
 and


what
 happened
 was
 these
 companies
 would


come
 to
 NASDAQ
 as
 small
 companies
 but


then
 they'd
 stay
 there
 are
 more
 private


companies
 than
 before
 now
 um
 it's
 partly


because
 of
 private
 Equity
 but
 it's
 also


because
 companies
 um
 choose
 to
 to
 stay


private
 so
 why
 should
 companies
 go


public
 and
 have
 a
 listing
 instead
 of


being
 private
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are


structural
 and
 cyclical
 reasons
 why
 the


the
 public
 markets
 are
 more
 or
 less


attractive
 to
 companies
 yeah
 but
 uh


cyclically
 of
 course
 it's
 just
 a
 matter


of
 our
 public
 investors
 ready
 to


underwrite
 risk
 in
 a
 time
 when
 you
 have


changing
 interest
 rate
 environment
 like


we're
 having
 right
 now
 but
 more


structurally
 it's
 the
 question
 is
 are
 is


the
 burden
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company


such
 that
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 that
 becomes


more
 attractive
 to
 remain
 private
 and


that's
 where
 we
 have
 to
 work
 with
 the


government
 to
 think
 about
 the
 balance
 of


the
 regulatory
 balance
 between
 the


responsibility
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company


and
 making
 your
 stock
 available
 to


Everyday
 consumers
 and
 everyday
 retail


investors
 but
 also
 the
 the
 the
 ability


for
 you
 to
 continue
 to
 drive
 your


strategy
 change
 you
 know
 and
 make


changes
 and
 and
 continue
 to
 progress
 in


a
 way
 that
 is
 still
 attractive
 to
 to


institutional
 um
 investors
 the
 fact
 that


there
 is
 so
 much
 concentration
 in
 the


market
 now
 you
 know
 few
 companies


account
 for
 a
 huge
 proportion
 of
 the


value
 of
 the
 so
 exchange
 is
 that
 a
 is


that
 a
 worry
 um
 I
 mean
 I
 would
 have
 to


say
 that's
 just
 the
 nature
 of
 the


economy
 as
 it's
 kind
 of
 been
 progressing


right
 you
 have
 these
 huge
 companies
 that


have
 really
 defined
 the
 future
 of
 our


economy
 really
 in
 terms
 of
 the


technological
 innovation
 that
 they're


underwriting
 the
 risk
 they're
 taking
 the


scale
 that
 they're
 providing
 to
 really


underpin
 the
 future
 of
 technology
 and


they
 have
 therefore
 become
 very
 large


parts
 of
 the
 economy
 because
 the
 entire


economy
 is
 becoming
 technological
 yeah


and
 so
 it's
 really
 a
 the
 natural


progression
 of
 economy
 towards
 these


technological
 um
 phenomenon
 really
 I


think
 that
 at
 the
 same
 time
 there
 are


still
 5,000
 companies
 listed
 on
 NASDAQ


so
 it's
 not
 like
 there
 are
 many
 many


companies
 that
 are
 innovators
 and
 change


agents
 and
 people
 who
 are
 in
 every


single
 sector
 of
 the
 economy
 creating


change
 driving
 new
 things
 bringing
 new


ideas
 into
 the
 market
 and
 also
 and
 or


and
 or
 just
 very
 mature
 companies


operating
 in
 in
 every
 sector
 of
 the


economy
 so


I
 don't
 actually
 agree
 that
 it's
 a
 bad


thing
 so
 Adina
 you
 became
 CEO
 in
 2017


yes
 what
 does
 one
 do
 when
 one
 becomes


the
 CEO
 of
 a
 big
 company
 how
 do
 you


approach
 it
 well
 I
 think
 first
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 what
 you're


walking
 into
 so
 I
 I
 started
 at
 nzac
 as


an
 intern
 31
 years
 ago
 yeah
 uh
 so
 I
 knew


the
 company
 very
 well
 well
 you
 were
 at


University
 uh
 right
 after
 yeah
 so
 um
 so


I
 knew
 the
 company
 very
 well
 coming
 into


the
 role
 of
 CEO
 but
 you
 you
 also
 have
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you're
 looking
 at
 with


fresh
 eyes
 and
 understanding
 kind
 of


where
 where
 is
 the
 company
 at
 the
 time


the
 second
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 came
 into
 a


company
 that
 was
 very
 well-managed
 and


and
 had
 a
 great
 foundation
 so
 it
 was
 I


had
 the
 fortune
 of
 coming
 into
 the
 seat


and
 playing
 offense
 from
 day
 one
 yeah
 so


my
 first
 year
 as
 CEO
 we
 really
 focus
 on


driving
 our
 strategy
 do
 you
 think
 you're


a
 better
 leader
 now
 than
 when
 you
 were


30
 oh
 definitely
 what's
 uh
 how
 are
 you


different
 well
 when
 you're
 30
 and
 you're


taking
 on
 you
 know
 a
 a
 you
 you
 kind
 of


want
 to
 think
 that
 you
 know
 everything


for
 one
 thing
 and
 second
 of
 all
 you're


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 not
 to
 do


everything
 but
 to
 make
 it
 all
 get
 done


the
 way
 that
 you
 want
 it
 you
 know
 that's


like
 if
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 you


know
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 scalability
 to


that
 that
 has
 some
 limitations
 um
 so


when
 you're
 30
 you're
 trying
 to
 learn


new
 skills
 learn
 how
 to
 manage
 learn
 how


to
 lead
 and
 obviously
 drive
 a
 business


forward
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 that
 you're


learning
 that
 you
 probably
 are
 not
 doing


perfectly
 how
 you
 do
 a
 different
 now
 so


when
 you
 go
 from
 being
 a
 manager
 to
 a


leader
 it's
 the
 difference
 between


directing
 people
 in
 their
 activities
 to


empowering
 people
 so
 that
 they
 can
 be


empowered
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job
 at
 their


job
 than
 you
 can
 do
 at
 their
 job
 isn't


that
 just
 amazing
 and
 that
 is
 a
 total


difference
 in
 skill
 set
 isn't
 it
 just


amazing
 you
 ask
 people
 to
 do
 something


without
 um
 setting
 any
 limitations
 or


defining
 it
 to
 uh
 kind
 of
 accurately
 and


then
 they
 just
 come
 up
 with
 things
 which


is
 beyond
 what
 you
 could
 do
 what
 beyond


what
 you
 could
 do
 so
 what
 does
 that


require
 I
 love
 it
 it
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


trust
 do
 you
 think
 kind
 kindness
 is


underrated
 in
 this
 Society
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 reputation
 within
 certain


industries
 that
 that
 would
 be
 the
 that


that
 um
 kindness
 is
 a
 weakness
 I
 think


kindness
 is
 a
 strength
 uh
 you
 know
 our


business
 we
 are
 a
 technology
 business


but
 we
 are
 founded
 on
 the
 on
 the
 notion


of
 relationships
 I
 always
 say
 that
 even


in
 the
 trading
 business
 where
 it
 is
 a


very
 analytical
 decision
 as
 to
 whether


we
 go
 first
 in
 your
 routing
 tables
 or


not
 that
 relationships
 break
 ties
 and
 so


at
 the
 very
 least
 relationships
 break


ties
 but
 at
 the
 most


they
 drive
 trust
 and
 if
 you
 are
 the


trusted
 provider
 clients
 naturally
 want


to
 do
 more
 with
 you
 and
 that
 trust
 is


the
 most
 important
 thing
 that
 you
 can


gain
 and
 I
 think
 kindness
 is
 a
 is
 a
 big


part
 of
 building
 that
 trust
 I
 think
 I


think
 the
 concept
 of
 kindness
 is
 quite


funny
 because
 when
 you
 are
 20
 the
 cool


people
 they
 were
 not
 kind
 they
 were
 the


least
 kind
 okay
 and
 so
 nobody
 wanted
 to


be
 kind
 because
 then
 you
 were
 just
 like


a
 loser
 now
 you
 fast
 forward
 until


you're
 50
 and
 if
 I
 were
 to
 if
 I
 were
 to


pick
 one
 trait
 which
 I
 would
 really
 love


to
 have
 in
 my
 you
 know
 partner
 or


colleague
 it's
 kindness
 of
 course


because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 kindness


is
 generally
 a
 reflection
 of
 confidence


too
 and
 and
 I
 think
 those
 things
 go
 hand


in
 glove
 with
 each
 other
 um
 and
 I
 you


know
 at
 the
 end
 that's
 what
 you're


looking
 for
 is
 that
 kind
 of
 kind


confident
 humble
 leader
 um
 person
 who


can
 relate
 to
 other
 people
 who
 can
 get


the
 most
 out
 of
 another
 person
 and
 who


cares
 about
 those
 other
 people
 and
 their


success
 that's
 a
 great
 leader
 and
 that's


what
 we
 look
 for
 now
 now
 finally
 we
 got


um
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 young
 people
 uh


listening
 to
 this
 what
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 them
 I
 would
 say
 first
 always


stay
 curious
 um
 always
 you
 know
 make


sure
 that
 you
 when
 you
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 say
 yes
 you
 say
 yes
 you


know
 early
 in
 my
 career
 I
 was
 asked
 to


do
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 were
 outside
 the


scoop
 of
 my
 job
 and
 I
 would
 always
 just


say
 okay
 I'll
 do
 that
 and
 then
 you
 go


back
 to
 your
 office
 and
 you
 go
 hm
 I


wonder
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 that
 but
 you


know
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 and


that's
 the
 great
 thing
 if
 someone's


trusting
 you
 to
 give
 you
 that
 projects


they
 think
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 figure
 it
 out
 so
 take
 it
