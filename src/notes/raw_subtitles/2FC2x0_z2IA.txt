[Music]


so
 hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 this
 live


podcast
 with
 kinik
 a
 remarkable
 Swedish


company
 and
 um
 this
 company
 was
 founded


in
 1936
 so
 has
 a
 long
 tradition
 in


driving
 growth
 and
 innovation
 in
 various


Industries
 Telecom
 e-commerce
 and


Healthcare
 and
 at
 mbim
 we
 own
 just
 under


4%
 of
 the
 company
 equivalent
 to
 just


under
 $1
 million
 so
 a
 warm
 welcome
 to


the
 CEO
 Georgie
 ganv
 and
 the
 chair
 James


Anderson
 so
 so
 um
 Georgie
 just
 before
 we


start
 what
 is


kinck
 so
 as
 you
 said
 we
 are
 290
 years


old
 or
 young
 I
 suppose
 uh
 we
 have
 a


history
 of
 um
 backing
 amazing
 Founders


and
 being
 part
 of
 building
 businesses


across
 various


sectors
 um
 we
 are
 publicly
 listed


meaning
 that
 we
 give
 public
 shareholders


the
 exposure
 to
 fast
 growing
 um


companies
 um
 and
 we
 have
 a
 long-term


mindset
 because
 we
 also
 have
 our


founding
 families
 still
 as
 lead


shareholders
 providing
 you
 know


shareholders
 of
 flesh
 and
 blood
 with


long-term
 mindset
 looking
 for
 returns


for
 Generations
 rather
 than
 quarters


that
 I
 think
 in
 simple
 terms
 who
 we
 are


good
 and
 how
 has
 the
 portfolio
 changed


over
 the
 years
 it
 has
 changed
 massively


uh
 because
 the
 only
 constant
 within


shinik
 is
 that
 we
 you
 know
 reinvent


ourselves
 so
 we've
 had
 a
 number
 of


transformation
 Transformations
 before


and
 for
 the
 last
 six
 years
 or
 so
 we
 have


again
 changed
 the
 portfolio
 into
 new


sectors
 so
 healthc
 care
 is
 was
 some


healthcare
 was
 something
 we
 built
 up


actually
 starting
 you
 know
 six
 six
 seven


years
 ago
 complete
 new
 sector
 so


transformed
 the
 portfolio
 massively
 over


the
 last
 years
 so
 when
 you
 come
 to
 work


every
 day
 what's
 your
 goal
 what
 is
 your


kind
 of
 long-term
 goal
 I
 mean
 I
 think


our
 ultimate
 goal
 is
 that
 we
 want
 to
 be


the
 best
 owners
 in
 these
 sectors
 for
 our


companies
 and
 I
 mean


a
 lot
 of
 investors
 say
 that
 they're


long-term
 for
 me
 that's
 not
 just
 a


holding
 period
 time
 it's
 basically
 what


type
 of
 discussions
 we
 are
 driving
 in


the
 boardroom
 so
 when
 I
 see
 especially


at
 you
 know
 times
 like
 this
 with
 this


quite
 difficult
 Market
 climate
 for
 for


growth
 uh
 Ventures
 we
 see
 short-term


discussions
 in
 the
 boardroom
 that
 we


don't
 like
 we
 would
 like
 to
 challenge


our
 Founders
 and
 discuss
 with
 them
 how


to
 expand
 features
 expand
 products


expand
 Footprints
 into
 new
 markets
 and


have
 those
 strategic
 discussions
 so


invest
 for
 returns
 for
 the
 future
 and


becoming
 that
 owner
 I
 think
 um
 is


something
 you
 you
 earn
 that
 right
 to


have
 those
 strategic
 discussions
 so
 for


us
 to
 uh
 be
 perceived
 or
 to
 be
 properly


perceived
 as
 a
 long-term
 investor
 what


kind
 of
 questions
 should
 we
 ask
 you


basically
 the
 size
 of
 the
 opportunity
 to


start
 with
 how
 large
 can
 something


become
 because
 I
 think
 people
 tend
 to


look
 at
 average
 returns
 M
 but
 forgetting


I
 think
 that
 those
 returns
 are
 buil
 up


typically
 by
 extreme
 outcomes
 so
 trying


to
 understand
 the
 potential
 and
 how
 big


something
 can
 become
 I
 think
 something


that
 I
 would
 welcome
 us
 you
 know
 welcome


um
 as
 a
 discussion
 now
 I
 saw
 um
 I
 saw


some
 stats
 that
 um
 out
 of
 1
 million


companies
 only


45
 get
 to
 a
 100
 year
 old
 what
 what
 do


you
 think
 is
 a
 key
 to
 in
 getting


there
 firstly
 I
 think
 every
 successful


company
 you
 know
 survives
 so
 you
 need
 to


survive
 to
 start
 with
 that's
 a
 good


starting
 point
 yep
 and
 then
 I
 think
 you


just
 need
 to
 realize
 that
 if
 you're


going
 for
 novel
 business
 models
 which
 I


think
 is
 something
 that
 differentiates


us
 as
 an
 investor
 all
 investor
 wants
 to


find
 amazing
 Founders
 great
 you
 know


visions
 and
 so
 forth
 but
 if
 you're


backing
 novel
 business
 models
 lacking


comparisons
 lacking
 peer
 groups
 it
 is


very
 difficult
 it's
 a
 different
 type
 of


risk
 you're
 taking
 and
 quite
 often
 it


turns
 out
 that
 might
 not
 work
 because
 of


wrong
 timing
 or
 wrong
 setup
 wrong


structure
 and
 so
 forth
 but
 when
 it
 works


it
 can
 actually
 create
 fantastic


outcomes
 what
 is
 how
 would
 you
 define


the
 investment
 strategy
 just
 now
 what


what
 type
 of
 companies
 are
 you
 looking


for
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 we're
 looking
 for


companies
 that
 actually
 are
 um


comfortable
 in
 articulating
 that
 great


vision
 and
 how
 large
 something
 can


really
 become
 um
 that
 there
 are
 bold
 and


brave
 uh
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 of
 course


understanding
 that
 creating
 a
 business


takes
 time
 and
 they
 should
 have
 that


grit
 to
 go
 through
 not
 only
 one
 period


of
 challenges
 but
 I
 think
 all
 great


companies
 speaking
 about
 envidia
 Amazon


and
 so
 forth
 and
 of
 course
 James
 knows


much
 more
 of
 these
 companies
 than
 I
 do


they
 all
 gone
 through
 difficult
 periods


so
 I
 think
 what
 I
 like
 to
 see
 in
 a


Founder
 is
 that
 he
 or
 she
 is
 is
 ready
 to


go
 through
 periods
 like


that
 um
 now
 what
 um
 how
 do
 you
 find
 that


in
 a
 Founder
 what
 are
 you
 what
 does
 an


interview
 look
 like
 so
 now
 I'm
 a
 Founder


how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 figure
 out
 whether


I've
 got
 the
 you
 know
 this
 grit
 or


resilience
 the
 first
 question
 I
 think
 is


to
 really
 pan
 out
 because
 typically
 when


you
 do
 your
 classical
 you
 know


three-year
 plans
 you
 tend
 to
 extrapolate


just
 what
 you're
 doing
 now
 which
 doesn't


tell
 me
 anything
 about
 what
 can


potentially
 you
 know
 happen
 and
 become


so
 to
 kind
 of
 pan
 out
 and
 to
 ask


questions
 regarding
 the
 10
 or
 20
 years


outcome
 that
 forces
 I
 think
 the
 founder


to
 think
 differently
 and
 certain


Founders
 that
 we
 have
 met
 and
 and
 of


course
 backed
 they
 have
 the


understanding
 of
 how
 large
 this
 can


become
 they
 can
 articulate
 that
 for
 the


long
 term
 while
 of
 course
 being
 very


disciplined
 and
 execution
 oriented


result
 oriented
 here
 now
 because
 you


also
 build
 typically
 great
 companies
 by


delivering
 every
 day
 every
 week
 so
 I


think
 we
 have
 we
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 we


are
 not


patient
 by
 seeing
 for
 seeing
 results
 we


want
 to
 see
 the
 results
 all
 the
 time
 but


at
 the
 same
 time
 we
 have
 the
 patient


Capital
 to
 actually
 wait
 for
 the
 large


outcomes
 and
 if
 you
 can
 have
 that


discussion
 with
 a
 founder
 and
 ask
 those


questions
 uh
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 good


starting
 point
 so
 that's
 about
 the


people
 but
 what
 about
 the
 industry
 and


the
 type
 of
 business
 you're
 looking
 at


yeah
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


industry
 we
 are
 we
 have
 always
 looked


for
 you
 know
 business
 models
 that
 can


change
 an
 entire
 sector
 going
 back
 to


the
 80s
 when
 shic
 was
 part
 of
 you
 know


um
 creating
 um
 Challenger
 within


telecommunications
 or
 the
 media
 sector


for
 instance
 or
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


e-commerce
 again
 backing
 novel
 business


models
 disrupting
 you
 know
 entire


sectors
 by
 providing
 better
 choice
 for


the
 consumer
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 the


starting
 point
 we
 always
 had
 that
 we


would
 like
 to
 see
 how
 we
 can
 use


technology
 in
 a
 way
 that
 would
 disrupt


an
 entire
 sectors
 typically
 a
 sector


that
 is
 you
 know
 where
 we
 see
 that


consumers
 are
 badly
 treated
 or
 they
 have


low
 experience
 or
 low
 customer


experience
 because
 of
 of
 uh
 lace


incumbent
 if
 I
 may
 use
 that
 word
 so
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 something
 that


attracts
 us
 uh
 to
 the
 Investments
 and
 we


can
 look
 at
 companies
 in
 our
 portfolios


today
 like
 recursion
 for
 instance
 where


we
 as
 an
 investor
 would
 back
 the


platform
 of
 drug
 Discovery
 whereas
 many


investors
 today
 they
 would
 look
 at
 the


actual
 candidates
 in
 a
 pipeline
 so
 how


many
 potential
 drugs
 are
 passing
 phase


one
 phase
 2
 etc
 those
 are
 the
 short-term


proof
 points
 we
 would
 more
 look
 at
 the


potential
 of
 the
 platform
 again
 and
 how


that
 fundamentally
 could
 change
 the


success
 of
 drug
 Discovery
 over
 a
 period


but
 do
 you
 think
 it
 was
 easier
 to
 be
 I


mean
 in
 a
 way
 you're
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 venture


capitalist
 uh
 you
 know
 investor
 do
 you


think
 that
 was
 easier
 in
 the
 old
 days


when
 there
 were
 less
 Venture
 Capital


companies
 competing
 for
 these


ideas
 yes
 and
 no
 because
 I
 think
 at
 that


time
 you
 were


by
 default
 unique
 if
 you
 were
 taking


those
 bets
 but
 today
 I
 think
 you


shouldn't
 underestimate
 how
 much
 impact


you
 can
 do
 by
 just
 being
 different
 and


again
 what
 I
 said
 taking
 different
 types


of
 risks
 business
 model
 risk
 is


something
 that
 very
 few
 investors
 do


actually
 they
 tend
 to
 look
 for


comparisons
 for
 peers
 Etc
 taking
 the


long-term
 bets
 by
 pushing
 the
 right


discussions
 is
 also
 something
 that
 is


different
 and
 although
 I
 think
 we
 have


we
 have
 a
 team
 now
 that
 have
 been
 kind


of
 spearheading
 a
 strategy
 of
 these


different
 sectors
 when
 we
 meet
 Founders


typically
 we
 are
 also
 selected
 as
 a


partner
 because
 of
 those
 different


different


mindsets
 moving
 on
 to
 you
 James
 you
 are


um
 one
 of
 the
 most
 successful
 investors


Europe
 has
 ever


seen


and
 in
 particular
 in
 the
 technology


sector
 you've
 been
 incredibly


early
 um
 tell
 us
 about
 your
 investment


philosophy
 because
 you
 say
 thatth
 the


normal
 ways
 of
 looking
 at
 companies
 is


not
 really
 valid
 and
 we
 need
 to
 look
 at


10
 15
 year
 upside
 downside
 scenarios
 do


what's
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 this
 well


firstly
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 the
 kind


words
 I
 I
 think
 there
 is
 something
 very


strange
 about
 our
 industry
 in
 the
 way
 it


thinks
 about


prediction
 um
 no
 experts
 on
 predictions


who
 I've
 ever
 talked
 to
 or
 read


would
 say
 that
 what
 you
 should
 be
 doing


is
 providing
 a
 spot
 number
 often
 to


three
 decimal
 points
 for
 a
 particular


company
 at
 a
 particular
 date
 we
 live
 in


a
 deeply
 complex


society
 where
 you
 cannot
 tell
 what
 is


going
 to


happen
 but
 you


can
 with
 all
 concerns
 about
 how
 precise


you
 ought
 to
 be
 in
 your
 likelihoods
 have


different
 scenarios
 and
 I
 don't
 know


whether
 it's
 been
 the
 same
 for
 you


but
 every
 single
 really
 successful


company
 that
 I've
 been
 fortunate
 enough


invest


in
 has
 way
 exceeded
 anything
 that
 I


could
 primarily
 envisage
 you
 know
 it's


become
 a
 matter
 of
 trying
 to
 use


imagination
 rather
 than
 anything


else
 and
 I
 actually
 sort
 of
 increasingly


become
 if
 I
 may
 say
 this
 more
 extreme


about
 this
 and
 I
 was
 thinking
 this
 when


you
 were
 asking
 Georgia
 just
 then
 about


what
 to
 answer


Founders
 for
 those
 very
 small
 number
 of


companies
 that
 dominate
 returns
 you
 know


in
 America
 since


1926
 just
 72
 companies
 provided
 half
 the


returns
 over
 bonds
 of


companies
 I
 think
 these
 people


Nikolai
 instantly
 shock


you
 but
 if
 you
 go
 back
 now
 for
 instance


you
 you've
 been
 one
 of
 the
 early
 very


large
 and
 serious
 backers
 of
 Tesla
 right


yeah
 so
 what
 did
 you
 think
 what
 what
 did


you
 think
 at
 the
 time
 when
 you
 made
 your


first
 investment
 how
 did
 you
 go
 about


that


analysis
 well
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 say
 is


I
 think
 you


need
 to
 have
 a
 long-term
 view
 point
 of


it
 and
 you
 know
 to
 go
 back
 to
 what
 I
 was


saying
 before
 I
 have
 a
 death
 draw
 full


of
 to
 the
 second
 decimal
 point
 top
 price


targets
 sent
 to
 me
 by
 kind
 hedge
 funds
 o


over
 over
 the


years
 but
 you
 know
 you
 also
 need
 don't


you
 different
 sets
 of
 information
 and


need
 different
 metrics
 and
 thinking


about
 all
 this
 and
 in
 all
 honesty
 the


most
 valuable
 help
 I
 had
 in
 it
 was


talking
 to
 a
 set
 of
 professors


particularly
 A
 lady
 called
 Jessica


tranic
 who
 is
 both
 at
 MIT
 and
 Santa
 Fe


Institute
 who
 was
 trying
 to
 think
 about


how
 Energy
 Technologies
 progress
 over
 50


20
 year
 time
 periods
 and
 that
 gave
 us


the
 confidence
 to


say


that
 actually
 your
 minimum
 Improvement


rate
 is
 15%
 per
 anom
 and
 it
 turned
 out


to
 be
 rather
 higher
 than
 that
 and
 if
 you


afford
 yourself
 time
 periods


sufficiently
 long
 15%
 is
 against
 a
 2
 to


3%
 improvements
 that
 even
 Toyota
 could


give
 you
 gave
 you
 confidence
 that
 it
 was


going
 to
 change


so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was
 about
 the


exponential
 change
 in
 the
 industry
 from


academic


sources
 I
 think
 you
 and
 I
 would
 agree


that
 for
 good
 or
 ill
 Elon
 certainly


falls
 into
 that
 category
 of
 being
 an


extraordinary
 person
 in
 the
 way
 he
 was


thinking
 about
 this
 the
 industry
 and


possibly
 even
 more
 so
 at
 that
 juncture


than
 in
 its
 present


Incarnation
 uh
 so
 I
 actually
 think
 that


as
 long
 as
 your
 clients
 allowed
 you


patience
 uh
 it
 was
 something
 that
 the


odds
 of
 success
 were
 pretty
 high


on
 give
 another
 example
 we
 talked


briefly
 about
 Atlas
 Copco
 for
 instance


who
 we
 had
 on
 on
 the
 podcast
 why
 why
 did


you
 invest
 in
 at
 Atlas
 Copco
 well
 the


first
 honest
 response
 would
 be
 that
 in


1986
 if
 I
 go
 back
 and
 read
 my
 notes


which
 STIs
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 longer
 but
 I


think
 I
 would
 have
 found
 the
 answer
 was


guys
 we're
 talking
 1986
 okay
 it's
 a
 long


time
 think
 about
 our
 holding
 period
 and


how
 we
 you
 know
 plan
 on
 extended
 this
 is


where
 we
 are
 this
 is
 where
 we're
 going


to
 yeah
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 at
 that
 time


the
 answer
 would
 probably
 have
 been


reasonably
 superficial
 I
 need
 to
 be
 be


honest
 about
 that
 it
 took
 me
 a
 long
 time


to
 to
 tr
 try
 and
 think
 about
 this
 in
 a


hopefully
 more
 profound


way
 I
 I
 think
 in
 that
 very
 Swedish


element
 of
 it
 having
 stable
 longterm


owners
 was
 incredibly
 important
 you
 know


what
 the
 wenberg
 Universe
 I
 know
 you


talk
 to
 um
 have
 enabled
 there
 is
 so
 far


different
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 you
 need


in
 most
 great
 companies
 Founders
 or
 long


run
 families
 I
 think
 there
 are
 very
 few


companies
 that
 don't
 have
 those
 that


become
 truly
 successful
 but
 it
 was
 also


an
 absolute
 commitment
 and
 this
 goes


back
 to
 George's
 point
 about
 constantly


widening
 the
 market
 um
 so
 that
 it
 got


big
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 rather
 than


exhausting
 those
 tiny
 areas
 of
 dominance


some
 companies
 have
 but
 what
 I
 most
 like


to
 understand
 more
 is
 within
 those
 two


conundrums
 how
 they've
 constantly


managed
 to
 select
 CEOs
 mostly
 who've


been
 there
 as
 you
 know
 for
 a
 very
 long


period
 of
 time
 who
 absolutely
 themselves


embody
 these
 principles
 and
 I
 think
 that


is
 very
 unusual
 and
 you
 know
 I
 sometimes


find
 the
 European
 companies
 that
 have


really
 succeeded
 even
 more
 interesting


than
 the
 American
 ones
 from
 this
 point


of
 view
 because
 it
 is
 actually
 something


wider
 isn't
 it
 than
 just
 the
 founder
 you


know
 I'd
 say
 exactly
 the
 same
 of
 asml


which
 is
 effect
 we
 never
 really
 had
 a


Founder
 but
 yet
 has
 had
 truly


astonishing
 people
 leading
 him
 for
 40


years
 so
 when
 do
 you


sell
 or
 do
 you
 sell


well
 I
 think


firstly
 one
 should
 think
 again
 and
 again


of
 it
 you
 know
 as
 Charlie
 manga
 says


interrupting
 compounding
 is
 not
 really
 a


very
 senseful
 thing
 to
 do
 and
 you
 know


my
 sins
 of
 commission
 on
 this
 front
 have


been
 worse
 than
 my
 U
 my
 my
 sins
 vom


mission
 on
 it
 um
 and
 you
 know
 both
 on


the
 buying
 and
 the
 selling
 um
 and
 I
 only


have
 to
 admit
 that
 I
 sold
 Apple
 in
 n
 in


2016
 um
 because
 I
 couldn't
 see
 how
 it


was
 going
 to
 grow
 and
 I
 couldn't
 see


post
 Steve
 how
 it
 was
 going
 to
 have
 the


ethos
 has
 now
 in
 some
 ways
 that's
 been


true
 but
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 it's
 it's


been
 true
 in
 economic
 terms
 even
 if
 it's


been
 absolutely
 wrong
 in
 stop
 stock


market
 terms
 I
 I
 think
 you
 should
 only


sell
 if
 you
 think
 you
 have
 actually
 got


to
 the
 period
 where
 you've
 exhausted


that
 growth
 and
 that
 growth
 has
 to
 be


estimated


via
 your
 imagination
 as
 well
 as
 any
 sort


of
 sense
 of
 predictions
 about
 it
 and
 you


know


I
 I


wish
 on
 the
 whole
 that
 i'
 kept
 to
 those


cultural
 factors
 more
 behind
 all
 that


you
 know
 I
 think
 once
 a
 company
 changes


its


nature
 uh
 then
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to


get
 the
 longevity
 and
 the
 extremes
 that


we've
 got
 so
 in
 some
 way
 expressing


about
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 market
 but
 a
 lot


of
 it
 is
 also
 have
 they
 got
 the
 culture


still
 that
 will
 enable
 them
 to
 explore


these


extraordinary
 uh


thesis
 that
 they
 have
 you
 know
 perhaps


can't
 put
 it
 better
 than
 if
 you
 excuse


me
 one
 more
 word
 it's
 a
 Jeff
 Bezos
 thing


isn't
 it
 I
 mean
 l
 Lots
 is
 but
 once
 a


company
 moves
 on
 to
 day
 two
 then
 it's


effectively
 beginning
 to
 die
 and
 you've


got
 to
 stay
 with
 that
 extraordinary


level
 of
 ambition
 extraordinary
 iconic


clasm
 about
 how
 you
 go
 about
 thinking


about
 your
 own
 Industries
 the
 fact
 that


um
 so
 few
 companies
 uh
 account
 for
 so


much
 of
 the
 growth
 in
 the
 market
 what


are
 the
 implications
 for
 how
 we
 should


invest
 so
 in
 days
 of
 you
 my
 largest


client
 and
 one
 which
 immensely
 helpful


was


Vanguard
 um
 and
 you
 imagine
 having


interesting
 conversations
 with
 a
 very
 um


own
 everything
 type
 approach
 and
 I
 think


there
 are
 basically
 three
 approaches


that
 you
 can
 have
 um
 and
 very
 quickly


you
 can
 own
 everything
 but
 I'm
 not
 sure


you
 can
 own
 everything
 because
 you
 can't


own
 the
 unquoted
 companies
 that
 George


is
 talking
 about
 but
 then
 you
 you
 don't


miss
 out
 secondly
 you
 do
 and
 I
 think


this
 is
 something
 which
 your


organization
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 extremely


well
 and
 can
 have
 a
 huge
 role
 on
 you
 try


and
 make
 the
 companies
 better
 by
 how
 you


are
 owning
 them
 it
 fits
 in
 with
 what


George
 is
 saying
 the
 third
 one
 which
 is


my
 own
 approach
 but
 I'm
 not
 remotely


trying
 to
 say
 it's


better
 is
 that
 you
 can
 believe
 that


there
 are
 identifiable
 characteristics


that
 truly
 great
 companies
 have
 and


actually
 I
 think
 in
 many
 ways
 I've


probably
 expanded
 that
 too
 much
 and
 had


too
 many
 not
 truly
 great
 companies
 but
 I


think
 they
 have
 identifiable


characteristics
 and
 I
 think
 you
 can


actually
 if
 you're
 prepared
 to
 use
 them


for
 long
 term
 I
 think
 the
 job
 is


possible
 it's
 in
 some
 ways
 simpler
 but


that's
 not
 the
 game
 that
 most
 people


believe
 they're
 doing
 I
 um
 I
 sometimes


use
 this
 an
 analogy
 which
 goes
 down


quite
 well
 with
 my
 Italian
 employes
 say


that
 you
 know
 Scotland
 where
 I
 come
 from


will
 never
 ever
 win
 a
 European
 or
 a


World
 Soccer
 Championship
 why
 well


mostly
 because
 we're
 not
 very
 good
 so
 we


did
 beat
 Norway
 last
 time
 around
 um
 um


but
 also
 you
 just
 need
 to
 have
 the
 scale


to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 some
 something


special
 about
 it
 but
 you
 know
 if
 we
 play


a
 different
 game
 like
 darts
 or
 snooker


mostly
 in
 Cloudy
 pubs
 we
 can
 be
 better


than
 other
 people
 at
 it
 now
 most
 people


in
 investment
 and
 I
 find
 this
 incredibly


sad
 but
 most
 people
 in
 investment
 to
 my


mind
 are
 engaged
 in
 the
 game
 and
 they


are
 incentivized
 to
 this
 of
 trying
 to


beat
 other
 people
 over
 short
 periods
 of


time
 I
 think
 if
 I
 say
 that
 you're


looking
 for
 the


extremes
 they
 have
 identified
 extremes


and
 you
 give
 your
 yourself
 or
 hopefully


your
 clients
 give
 you
 at
 least
 10
 years


to
 do
 it
 it
 becomes
 a
 feasible
 game


which
 as
 much
 chance
 as
 winning
 you
 know


could
 sound
 very
 arrogant
 otherwise


could
 do
 Nikolai
 you
 know
 saying
 I
 can


do
 this
 other
 people
 I
 just
 don't


believe
 that's
 what
 most
 Mar


participants
 are
 doing
 you
 know
 the


figure
 in
 New
 York
 is
 that
 60%
 of
 people


are
 are
 paid
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 their
 daily


p&l
 well
 that
 you're
 not
 you're
 not


going
 to
 be
 interested
 in
 trying
 to
 find


the
 Exp
 exponential
 companies
 for
 the


long
 term
 if
 that's
 what
 you
 what
 you're


going
 through
 would
 you
 be
 pleased
 to


hear
 that
 we
 have
 a
 slightly
 longer
 term


Horizon
 than
 daily
 um
 now
 um
 Georgie


just
 moving
 on
 to
 uh
 the
 difference


between
 uh
 Europe
 and
 and
 the
 US
 just


how
 what's
 the
 difference
 between
 the


startup
 scene
 we
 are
 seeing
 in
 Europe


and
 the
 US
 and
 in
 a
 way
 why
 is
 why
 is
 US


succeeding
 so
 much
 better
 than
 Europe
 I


think
 if
 I
 kind
 of
 boil
 things
 down
 um


the
 word
 I
 think
 of
 is


ambition
 and
 for
 sure
 now
 when
 we
 have


you
 know
 more
 than
 half
 of
 our
 portfolio


in
 US
 businesses
 I
 see
 a
 clear


difference
 it's
 an
 ambition
 level
 that


is
 much
 higher
 in
 the
 US
 compared
 to


Europe
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 really
 why
 but
 in


Europe
 we
 tend
 to
 focus
 a
 lot
 you
 know


around
 legislation


boundaries
 um
 regulation
 Etc
 instead
 of


actually
 thinking


how
 to
 do
 the
 you
 know
 impossible
 kind


of
 so
 that's
 that's
 the
 ambition
 level


and
 that
 goes
 well
 beyond
 Founders
 I


think
 also
 investors
 think
 in
 a


different
 way
 in
 Europe
 um
 and
 we
 have


of
 course
 fantastic
 European
 examples
 I


mean
 companies
 like
 Spotify
 and
 others


that
 have
 proven
 that
 you
 can
 truly


become
 Global
 winners
 but
 still
 I
 think


the
 ambition
 level
 is
 is
 a
 big


difference
 what
 about
 Stockholm
 I
 think


Stockholm
 has
 Sweden
 has
 the
 pleasure
 of


of
 having
 having
 several
 factors
 that


has
 you
 know
 helped
 you
 know
 this


startup
 scene
 to
 move
 everything
 from


you
 know
 PCS
 being
 you
 know
 rolled
 out


during
 um
 number
 of
 years
 in
 the
 in
 the


90s
 sorry
 um
 very
 early
 on
 I
 was
 uh


working
 with
 that
 you
 know
 myself
 with


with
 kind
 of
 um
 fiber
 to
 the
 home
 kind


of
 allow
 people
 to
 have
 fast
 access
 to


to
 internet
 early
 in
 the
 early
 days
 has


been
 kind
 of
 part
 of
 the
 of
 of
 of
 the


scene
 growing
 and
 I
 think
 also
 that


successful
 startups
 uh
 typically
 you


know
 feed
 other
 startups
 because
 you


mentioned
 this
 home
 PC
 just
 explain


briefly
 because
 in
 Sweden
 there
 was
 a


situation
 where
 well
 people
 just
 got
 PCS


right
 yes
 at
 home
 and
 very
 affordable
 at


least
 yeah
 I
 know
 but
 I
 mean
 it's
 quite


interesting
 that
 how
 how
 a
 government


can
 actually
 accelerate
 technological


yes
 progress
 by
 something
 like
 that
 it


wasn't
 very
 expensive


no
 it
 wasn't
 expensive
 and
 I
 think
 it


again
 was
 a
 long-term
 bet
 understanding


that
 if
 we
 would
 provide
 more
 people


with
 this
 these
 tools
 and
 the


infrastructure
 which
 basically
 is
 the


broadband
 connection
 right
 good
 things


will
 happen
 probably
 lots
 of
 good
 things


as
 well
 we
 had
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 debates


around
 Pirate
 Bay
 and
 other
 stuff
 during


this
 period
 of
 time
 but
 I
 think
 it


actually
 created
 a
 lot
 of
 innovation
 so


we
 can
 definitely
 do
 it
 in
 in
 Europe
 as


well
 but
 it's
 sad
 to
 to
 say
 say
 that


it's
 a
 clear
 difference
 today
 both


within
 the
 investment
 community
 and
 and


founder
 community
 that
 the
 ambition


level
 is
 different
 then
 of
 course
 having


said
 that
 us
 is
 a
 huge
 market
 and
 and


you
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 abroad
 before


scaling
 what
 we
 see
 in
 Europe
 is
 that
 it


just
 takes
 a
 year
 or
 two
 after
 a
 company


has
 started
 and
 then
 it
 needs
 to
 think


about
 expansion
 and
 going
 into
 New


Market
 new
 language
 new
 cultures
 Etc


within
 Europe
 can
 be
 more
 difficult
 than


for
 you
 as
 company
 to
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the


difference
 between
 uh
 private
 and
 public


uh


companies
 I
 mean
 we
 say
 sometimes
 that


we
 can
 actually
 save
 companies
 from


going
 public
 it
 sounds
 a
 bit
 sad
 but
 but


especially
 since
 we
 are
 a
 public
 company


ourselves
 but
 we
 see
 sometimes


that
 Founders
 in
 the
 private
 environment


has
 the
 freedom
 to
 actually
 focus
 on


building
 a
 great
 company
 for
 the
 long


term
 and
 once
 they're
 public
 they
 are


actually
 evaluated


along
 the
 lines
 that
 James
 just


described
 right
 so
 much
 shorter
 time


periods
 different
 type
 of
 of
 you
 know


work


streams
 uh
 you
 seldom
 you
 know
 hear
 a


private
 founder
 or
 founder
 in
 a
 private


environment
 think
 too
 much
 about
 what
 to


do
 today
 to
 improve
 the
 share
 price
 but


that's
 quite
 common
 actually
 in
 the


public
 environment
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is


that's
 a
 big
 contradiction
 when
 you
 want


the
 company
 to
 focus
 on
 Innovation
 and


R&D
 and
 me
 and
 James
 just
 discussed
 the


other
 day
 about
 you
 know
 Nvidia
 H
 when


they
 had
 this
 massive
 uh
 setback
 in
 I


think
 it
 was
 2006
 and
 then
 nearly
 they


were
 nearly
 wiped
 out
 right
 exactly


share
 price
 dropped
 more
 than
 8%
 and
 and


the
 sad
 thing
 here
 the
 funny
 thing
 I


don't
 know
 the
 irony
 at
 least
 is
 that
 it


was
 because
 they
 invested
 a
 lot
 in
 R&D


Building
 the
 platform
 that
 then
 created


a
 trillion
 dollar
 company
 right
 so
 the


markets
 are
 not
 rewarding
 businesses


typically
 in
 the
 public
 environment
 to


invest
 for
 the
 future
 I
 think
 so
 now
 you


look
 at
 so
 now
 you
 look
 at
 so
 James
 go


back
 to
 you
 um
 now
 you
 look
 at
 where
 the


R&D
 is
 being
 spent
 uh
 where
 the


Innovation
 is
 where
 do
 you
 think
 we're


going
 to
 make
 the
 most
 money
 in
 the
 next


5
 to
 10
 years
 what
 type
 of


Industries


oh
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 three


outstanding
 areas
 um
 one
 I'll
 just
 just


mention
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 need
 is


I
 think
 that
 in
 clean


technology
 there
 are
 much
 better


business
 models
 than
 people
 believe
 and


that
 that
 can
 be
 done
 at
 scale
 the


second
 would
 be
 and
 George
 has
 touched


on
 it
 at
 the
 moment
 where
 data
 meets


genomics
 I
 think
 that
 we
 got
 a
 chance
 of


moving
 our
 understanding
 of
 human


biology
 up
 from
 I
 don't
 know
 15%
 to
 50%


and
 I
 think
 that
 will
 lead
 to
 a
 complete


transformation
 which
 hopefully
 will
 lead


to
 Better
 Health
 Care
 at
 lower
 costs
 so


of
 course
 there
 are
 many
 things
 cutting


against
 that
 the
 third
 one
 would
 be
 that


I
 do
 believe
 that
 AI
 has
 huge


opportunities
 but
 in
 a
 very
 different


way
 I
 think
 than
 people
 are
 going
 about


at
 the


moment
 if
 AI
 continues
 to
 compound
 its


its
 power
 levels
 its
 understanding


levels
 at
 something
 like
 60%
 perom
 then


trying
 to
 think
 about
 what
 problems
 we


can
 solve
 in
 10
 years
 time
 becomes


what's
 interesting
 from
 my
 point
 of
 view


and
 what
 type
 of
 problems
 are
 they
 well


I
 think
 it
 feeds
 back
 into
 the


healthcare
 one
 at
 the
 first
 place
 and
 I


think
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 interesting
 I


think
 there
 are
 you
 know
 you
 you'll


recognize
 that
 it's
 early
 stages
 here


but
 you
 were
 just
 beginning
 to
 get


companies
 evolve
 into
 that
 which
 I
 think


is
 a
 sign
 of
 real
 hope
 that
 we're
 going


to
 break
 out
 into
 it
 and
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 critical
 to
 reforming


Healthcare
 I
 think
 one
 much
 talked
 about


for
 many
 years
 and
 again
 back
 to
 a


company
 that
 we
 mentioned
 I
 think
 that


you've
 get
 that
 rate
 of
 improvement
 than


both
 autonomous
 driving
 and
 Robotics
 for


general
 purposes
 become
 extremely


compelling
 um
 and
 at
 prices
 levels
 where


they
 can
 transform
 our
 world
 and
 George


do
 you
 agree
 on
 this
 or
 are
 are
 you


coordinated
 in
 where
 you
 want
 with
 the


money
 kind
 of
 hopes
 so
 in
 away
 most
 of


the
 time
 not
 always
 but
 most
 of
 the
 time


and
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 I'm
 an
 engineer
 by


training
 and
 I'm
 truly
 fascinating


because
 we're
 now
 seeing
 something
 that


is
 that
 hasn't
 happened
 before
 I
 think


for
 the
 first
 time
 we
 can
 translate
 you


know
 human
 biology
 chemistry
 into
 you


know
 technology
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever


and
 this
 is
 not
 this
 does
 not
 mean
 that


we
 move
 boundaries
 we
 actually


completely
 remove
 them
 so
 I
 honestly


think
 that
 we
 are
 looking
 at
 something


that
 could
 you
 know
 change
 fundamental


again
 how
 we
 look
 at
 Healthcare
 and
 Drug


Discovery
 but
 also
 in
 other
 areas
 I
 mean


we
 we
 backed
 a
 fantastic
 company
 where


we
 are
 backing
 a
 fantastic
 company


called
 Solen
 in
 the
 US
 that
 has


reinvented
 chemical
 engineering
 they
 can


actually
 produce


materials
 um
 and
 the
 result
 is
 kind
 of


carbon
 net
 negative
 and
 that
 wasn't
 able


to
 do
 just
 you
 know
 five
 10
 years
 ago


was
 impossible
 so
 now
 I
 think
 we
 have


all
 this
 Innovation
 and
 yet
 the
 market


seems
 to
 focus
 more
 on
 the
 daily
 trading


and
 the
 next
 quarter's
 results
 and
 I


think
 it's
 quite
 quite
 interesting
 that


we're
 talking
 about
 things
 in
 in
 10
 or


15
 years
 time
 what
 this
 technology
 can


do
 I
 I
 do
 believe
 however
 that
 there


will
 be
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 margin


compressions
 around
 the
 AI
 field
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 what
 we
 call
 thin
 wrappers


that
 might
 not
 have
 you
 know
 so
 much


deep
 connection
 to
 businesses
 you
 know


workflows
 or
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 very


limited
 modes
 there
 uh
 we
 won't
 see
 the


same
 kind
 of
 development
 earning
 wise


over
 time
 okay
 good
 um
 changing
 t
 a
 bit


here
 um
 James
 moving
 back
 to
 um


governance
 what
 what
 what
 are
 your
 main


priorities
 as
 the


chair
 my
 number
 one
 priority
 at
 the


moment
 is
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that


Georgie
 and
 his


team
 have
 the
 confidence
 to
 invest
 in
 a


way
 that
 logically
 fits
 into
 the


philosophy
 both
 of
 us
 I
 think
 is


expressing
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 there


was
 is
 a
 continuous
 danger
 when
 you
 are


in
 a
 bad
 phase
 of
 markets
 or
 a
 bad
 phase


in
 the
 company
 or
 both
 combined
 that
 you


give
 up
 trying
 to
 be
 truly
 successful


and
 I
 so
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 you
 call
 him


and
 say
 come
 on
 Georgie
 Cher


up
 well
 I
 you
 know
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 fact


yes
 some


I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 actually
 think
 that


the
 human
 aspect
 of
 that
 is
 important


you
 know
 there's
 this
 great
 story
 about


Bezos
 and
 Buffett
 you
 know
 at
 a
 far


higher
 level
 than
 Georg
 you
 myself
 that


you
 know
 in


2005
 Buffett
 very
 publicly
 went
 and
 put


his
 arms
 around
 Bezos
 and
 said
 Jeff


you're
 getting
 it
 right
 don't
 listen
 to


the
 market
 these
 things
 really
 matter


and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 know
 it's
 as
 Jensen


and
 Nidia
 says
 you
 know
 if
 he
 if
 he'


known
 how
 hard
 this
 was
 going
 to
 be
 he


wouldn't
 have
 done
 it
 um
 so
 you
 know


you've
 got
 to
 keep
 that
 but
 I
 think
 that


there
 is
 you
 know
 I
 think
 very
 often
 as


George
 was
 implying
 a
 different
 way


around
 I
 think
 what
 goes
 on
 at
 board


meetings
 does
 matter
 from
 that
 point
 of


view
 does
 it
 help
 to
 have
 a
 big
 family


shareholder
 for
 sure
 I
 would
 say
 so
 I


mean
 I
 think
 in
 what
 ways
 I
 mean
 I
 think


shareholders
 of
 flesh
 and
 blood
 again


thinking
 about
 generation
 rather
 than


quarters
 matters
 and
 I
 think
 especially


when
 you
 have
 founding
 families
 as
 in


chinik
 that
 have
 they
 have
 been
 around


for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 they
 have
 seen


you
 know
 changes
 before
 if
 there's
 some


you
 know
 Legacy
 in
 culture
 and
 history


we
 have
 it
 is
 that
 we
 have
 done
 many
 new


things
 and
 one
 of
 our
 uh
 you


know
 persons
 within
 the
 famous
 person


persons
 within
 chinik
 John
 sbec
 he
 said


I
 don't
 just
 want
 to
 see
 around
 the


corner
 I
 want
 to
 live
 around
 that
 corner


that
 and
 how
 is
 it
 and
 how
 is
 it
 to
 take


over
 after
 somebody
 like
 that
 right
 I


mean
 he
 was
 he
 was
 he
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 a


Visionary
 genius
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 you


are
 not
 but
 uh
 and
 of
 you
 know
 probably


you
 are
 but
 but
 he
 for
 he
 for
 sure
 was


right
 and
 what
 is
 it
 to
 take
 to
 take


that
 I
 first
 of
 all
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that


I
 I
 wouldn't
 compare
 myself
 to
 to
 anyone


uh
 like
 that
 but
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 thing
 to
 understand
 as
 a
 CEO


of
 shinik
 is
 that
 you're
 actually
 taking


the
 Baton
 m
 and
 you
 are
 carrying
 this


forward
 because
 this
 is
 much
 more
 than


one
 person
 or
 one
 team
 it's
 actually
 an


institution
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 unique
 you


know
 vehicle
 because
 we
 have
 the


combination
 of
 being
 an
 investor
 you


know
 looking
 at
 fast
 grown
 tech


companies
 but
 also
 in
 one
 way
 backed
 by


you
 know
 a
 family
 office
 kind
 of
 of


mentality
 with
 this
 long-term
 approach


that
 is
 unique
 is
 it
 important
 that


board
 members
 own
 shares
 in
 the
 company


comp
 is
 where
 they
 on
 the


board
 yes
 though
 I
 fully
 accept
 that
 the


number
 they
 own
 is
 dependent
 on
 their


own
 personal
 cyes
 is


yes
 is
 kin
 very
 Swedish


company
 in
 that
 we
 had
 um
 Arin
 mayor
 on


um
 the
 podcast
 and
 uh
 she
 talks
 about


the
 importance
 of
 consensus
 decisions
 in


Sweden
 now
 at
 the
 same
 time
 when
 you


reach
 consensus
 is
 normally
 not
 a
 very


good
 investment
 because
 it's
 so


consensual
 right
 so
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 balance
 this
 how
 do
 you
 how
 can
 you


be
 contrarian
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 country


like
 Sweden
 where
 everybody
 has
 to
 agree


for
 from
 that
 perspective
 I
 think
 we're


typically
 non-s
 Swedish
 and
 I
 think


that's
 why
 shinik
 in
 the
 past
 has


been
 very
 much
 of
 a
 role
 model
 I
 think


to
 certain
 Sweden
 Founders
 that
 have


been
 looked
 at
 at
 you
 know
 the
 stenbeck


family
 and
 shinc
 as
 an
 example
 of
 being


a
 contrarian
 and
 taking
 bold
 decisions
 I


don't
 believe
 in
 always
 in
 Democratic


decisions
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 you
 should


listen
 and
 carefully
 consider
 every


different
 perspectives
 so
 having
 a
 a


open
 discussion
 a
 good
 decision-making


process
 is
 one
 thing
 trying
 to
 agree
 on


everything
 is
 a
 total
 different
 thing


and
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 there
 so
 from


that
 perspective
 we're
 very
 nons
 Swedish


how
 do
 you
 deal
 with


failures
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 first
 of
 all
 you


need
 to
 acknowledge
 failures
 um
 but
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 but
 but
 do
 you
 guys


really
 Ann
 acknowledge
 failures
 at
 kin


you
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 your
 successes
 you


don't
 talk
 so
 much
 about
 the
 stuff
 that


doesn't
 go
 so
 well
 H
 it
 hurts
 to
 talk


about
 failures
 but
 actually
 we
 do
 we


talk
 about
 things
 that
 have
 gone
 wrong


we
 have
 you
 know
 taking
 some
 serious


bets
 in
 in
 companies
 that
 have
 gone
 bust


and
 we've
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 that
 we


talk
 about
 but
 I
 think
 what's


important
 is
 it
 that
 it
 doesn't
 create


this
 culture
 of
 you
 know
 fear
 of
 doing


mistakes
 because
 we
 we
 are
 in
 the


business
 of
 risk-taking
 and
 I'm
 sure


that
 every
 great
 company
 out
 there


including
 shinik
 will
 do
 a
 lot
 of


mistakes
 during
 that
 successful
 Journey


right
 so
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 obsessed
 about


failures
 in
 a
 negative
 way
 I
 think
 that


can
 form
 a
 culture
 that
 is
 very
 negative


when
 it
 comes
 to
 seeing
 the
 potential


going
 forward
 somehow
 I
 think
 you
 should


as
 an
 investor
 sometimes
 celebrate
 you


know
 mistakes
 and
 and
 see
 that
 as


something
 you
 know
 very
 natural
 in
 your


evolution
 of
 becoming
 better
 and


sometimes
 I
 also
 get
 annoyed
 by
 people


saying
 that
 it's
 very
 good
 to
 extract


learnings
 so
 we
 don't
 do
 the
 same


mistake
 twice
 I
 do


agree
 but
 there
 are
 so
 many
 new
 mistakes


to
 be
 done
 so
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 sure
 you


can
 protect
 yourselves
 from
 doing


mistakes
 just
 because
 you
 learn
 your


past
 mistakes
 you
 just
 have
 to
 live
 with


them
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 when
 you
 hit


that
 extreme
 outcome
 it
 hopefully
 will


actually
 compensate
 for
 all
 the
 mistakes


you've
 done
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 I


don't
 know
 James
 if
 I
 get
 fired
 now
 or


or
 so
 we
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 I
 just


love
 to
 explore
 that
 a
 bit
 uh
 you
 know


kind
 of
 the
 potential
 of
 being
 fired


because
 um
 not
 not
 you
 of
 course
 but
 um


um
 James
 you
 mentioned
 um
 a
 bit
 earlier


that
 uh
 you
 know
 if
 your
 shareholders


permit
 you
 you
 know
 if
 your
 investors


permit
 you
 to
 be
 longterm
 right
 yeah
 now


um
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 a
 draw
 down


and
 how
 much
 money
 you
 can
 lose
 before


your
 job
 is
 at
 stake
 right
 so
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 in
 this
 fund
 that
 they
 have
 this


um
 tracking
 error
 budget
 is
 that
 so


there
 are
 limit
 for
 how
 bad
 we
 can


do
 because
 this
 is
 a
 very
 important
 fund


now
 have
 you
 got
 have
 you
 got
 any
 type


of
 risk
 management
 put
 on
 you
 or
 Draw


down
 limits
 or
 you
 know
 we
 have
 of


course
 a
 lot
 of
 risk
 you
 know
 um


parameters
 that
 we
 look
 at
 um
 but
 I


think
 typically
 what
 we
 do
 we
 back
 a


company
 because
 we
 have
 a
 thesis
 and
 we


see
 that
 big
 picture
 but
 we
 don't
 deploy


all
 the
 capital
 at
 once
 what
 we


typically
 do
 is
 that
 we
 deploy
 the


capital
 over
 time
 when
 we
 see
 the


company
 develop
 and
 of
 course
 that
 can


reach
 a
 certain
 number
 that
 it's
 a
 lot


of
 money100
 million
 or
 more
 but
 at
 a


certain
 point
 we
 don't
 regret
 that
 we


back
 that
 you
 know
 in
 the
 beginning
 and


we
 admit
 that
 we
 made
 a
 mistake
 and
 the


company
 will
 actually
 not
 be
 part
 of
 our


portfolio
 either
 because
 it's
 written


down
 or
 it
 goes
 bust
 that
 happens
 but


but
 it's
 a
 limit
 of
 course
 how
 much


Capital
 we
 can
 put
 in
 that
 company


what
 do
 you
 think


James
 I
 think
 how
 how
 badly
 can
 he
 do


before
 you
 give
 him
 a
 different
 type
 of


telephone
 call
 yeah
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it


should
 be
 about
 making
 an
 assessment
 of


the
 caliber
 of
 the
 decision
 making
 more


than
 the


outcome
 um
 and
 I
 think
 we
 forget
 just


how
 fragile
 success
 is
 so
 go
 back
 to


another
 company
 that
 in
 mark
 rust
 to


Atlas
 Copco
 which
 I
 held
 on
 to
 through


this
 I
 earliest
 semesters
 when
 I
 was


working
 as
 assistant
 in
 American


depart
 was
 in
 Home


Depot
 now
 Home
 Depot
 in
 I
 think
 late


1985
 might
 have
 been
 early
 1986
 but


around
 that
 time
 period
 again
 was
 within


3
 weeks
 of
 going


bankrupt
 and
 I
 believe
 there's
 a
 Harvard


case
 study
 around
 this
 at
 the
 time


now
 it
 is
 since
 then
 one
 of
 the
 25
 best


investments
 you
 could
 have
 made
 if
 youve


carried
 on
 loaning


it


um
 if
 they'
 gone
 under
 at
 that
 point


would
 they
 have
 deed
 a
 prium
 I'm
 not


really
 sure
 they
 would
 because
 the


entire
 thesis
 was
 was
 out
 there
 and
 GRE


and
 the
 upside
 was


huge
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 is
 about


think
 thinking
 about
 the
 caliber
 of


thought
 and
 the
 caliber
 of
 work
 that
 is


done
 and
 on
 that
 score
 yeah
 I
 do
 think


that
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 people
 in
 the


financial
 industry
 who
 don't
 deserve
 to


have
 very
 highly
 remunerated
 jobs
 and
 to


keep


them
 but
 I
 think
 also
 I
 mean
 in
 times


like
 this
 when
 we
 had
 a
 big
 Market
 reset


it's
 more
 difficult
 to
 raise
 capital
 for


growth
 in
 our
 companies
 for
 sure
 um
 I


think
 we
 need
 also
 to
 be
 humble
 right


because
 it's
 easy
 to
 say
 that
 now
 we


separate
 the
 winners
 from
 the
 losers
 we


separate
 the
 weat
 from
 the
 shaft
 and
 so


forth
 but
 there
 are
 definitely
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 out
 there
 that
 will
 go
 bust


because
 they
 can't
 raise
 Capital
 that


could
 have
 become
 something


extraordinary
 and
 we
 are
 the
 one


deciding
 whether
 they
 should
 have
 that


chance
 might
 not
 be
 so
 that
 it's
 a
 bad


company
 but
 we
 did
 not
 give
 them
 that


chance
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 for
 us
 of


course
 we
 can't
 we
 can't
 fund
 every


company
 we
 have
 in
 the
 portfolio
 we


can't
 fund
 every
 company


out
 there
 but
 we
 should
 also
 remind


ourselves
 that
 it's
 difficult
 to


actually
 you
 know
 see
 that
 future


potential
 Al
 in
 a
 company
 that's


struggling
 otherwise
 investing
 would
 be


easy
 you
 would
 only
 then
 allocate
 more


Capital
 to
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 performing


right
 now
 every
 day
 yeah
 but
 that's
 not


the
 case
 investing
 is
 not
 easy
 James


what
 advice
 would
 you
 have
 to
 us
 as
 a


firm
 well
 firstly
 I
 I
 repeat
 that
 I


genuinely
 have
 admiration
 for
 you're


going
 on
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 remotely


arrogant
 enough
 to
 say
 that
 I
 can
 better


but
 I
 I
 think
 that
 you
 have
 such


enormous


opportunities
 to
 do
 good
 for
 the
 way
 the


financial
 sector
 Works
 indeed
 so
 that
 it


goes
 beyond
 niol
 made
 the
 financial


sector
 because
 you
 know
 I've
 always
 had


this
 belief
 that
 really
 would
 be
 better


off
 if
 we
 thought
 about
 the
 job
 that


we're
 doing
 as
 trying
 to
 help
 build


great


companies
 I
 think
 you
 have
 an
 unequal


chance
 to
 try
 and
 help
 build
 great


companies
 and
 the
 second
 part
 of


that
 is
 that
 I
 think
 that


building
 a
 really
 distinctive


individualized
 investment
 culture
 with


inside
 your
 organization
 would
 be
 a


fascinating
 project
 for
 you
 because
 and


what
 should
 it
 look
 like
 sorry
 and
 what


should
 that
 culture
 look


like
 I
 think
 the
 culture
 and
 I
 hope
 this


is
 consistent
 with
 the
 many
 of
 the


companies
 that
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 should
 be
 all
 of
 you
 taking
 a
 look


at
 what
 you
 think
 from
 the
 first


principles
 your
 objectives
 are
 what
 you


can
 contribute
 in
 the
 broadest
 possible


sense
 and
 not
 to
 care
 at
 all
 if
 that
 and


again
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 you
 were
 in
 a


strong
 position
 in
 most
 ways
 from
 that


point
 of
 view
 and
 not
 to
 care
 whether


that
 cuts
 against
 the
 convention
 you


know
 talking
 to
 your
 colleagues
 earlier


about
 you
 know
 I
 personally
 believe
 that


there
 is
 no
 evidence
 that
 the
 financial


rewards
 prevalent
 in
 most
 markets
 of
 for


for
 investment
 do
 anything
 to
 help
 get


you
 to
 better
 investment
 so
 rethink
 it


all
 rethink
 the
 metrics
 that
 you
 judge


by
 companies
 by


I
 was
 been
 incredibly


influenced
 recently
 by
 kathen
 gico
 the


um
 discover
 of
 many
 mRNA
 technologist
 as


most
 of
 you
 all
 know


autobiography
 which
 was
 relating
 the


terrible
 terrible
 things
 she
 had
 to
 go


through
 in


Academia
 um
 because
 of
 what
 she
 put
 were


the
 rituals
 of
 how
 you
 had
 to
 do
 things


each
 year
 and
 gradually
 the
 amount
 of


money
 she
 was
 allowed
 the
 research
 staff


the
 size
 of
 the
 lab
 even
 the
 appointment


of


her
 was
 in
 question
 just
 because
 she
 was


being
 measured
 by
 how
 much
 money
 she


brought
 in
 each
 year
 then
 at
 the
 end
 of


20
 years
 you
 suddenly
 win
 the
 Nobel


Prize
 you
 don't
 know
 when
 these
 things


are
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 they
 need
 to
 be


given
 this
 their


space
 now
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 young


people
 listening
 uh
 to
 this
 podcast
 you


know
 the
 room
 is
 full
 of
 them
 um
 what


kind
 of
 advice
 would
 you
 give
 them


Georgie
 we
 start
 with
 you


I
 mean
 I
 think
 if
 I
 go
 back
 um
 some


years
 it's
 it's
 really
 the
 question


about
 planning
 I
 think
 it's
 very


difficult
 to
 plan
 things
 because
 seldom


it
 turns
 out
 as
 you
 plan
 them
 it's
 when


it
 comes
 to
 your
 develop
 your
 personal


development
 your
 career
 I
 think
 it's


impossible
 right
 so
 you
 need
 to
 do
 what


you're
 passionate
 about
 and
 what
 you're


interested
 about
 and
 also
 coming
 back
 to


what
 we
 discussed
 earlier
 the
 mistakes


right
 allow
 yourself
 to
 do
 some
 mistakes


it's
 not
 possible
 to
 learn
 by
 just
 doing


the
 things
 that
 you're
 comfortable
 with


and
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 able
 to
 do
 more


mistakes
 earlier
 on
 you
 will
 become


wiser
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 something
 I


wish
 someone
 would
 have
 given
 me


confidence
 to
 do
 early
 on
 in
 my
 career


what
 about
 you


JS
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the
 courage


to
 think


differently
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 I'm
 incredibly
 saddened
 by
 the


number
 of
 people
 I've


seen
 who
 continued
 in
 a
 financial


services
 or
 investment
 industry
 because


they
 were
 a
 wellp
 paid
 and
 B
 it
 was


thought
 to
 be
 a
 relatively
 prestigious


job
 and
 they
 didn't
 enjoy
 it
 at
 all
 so


your
 advice
 is
 to
 leave
 the
 financial


sector
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 real


willingness
 to
 think
 differently
 or
 that


you
 find
 just
 you
 know
 my
 own
 case
 just


a
 sheer
 problem
 of
 investment
 to
 be


sufficiently
 intriguing
 that
 you
 know


provides
 you
 with
 the
 inherent


motivation
 from
 from
 that
 point
 of
 view


I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 great
 piece
 of


advice
 and
 a
 good
 place
 to
 end
 hey
 if


you
 don't
 like
 it
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 to


be
 different
 uh
 do
 something
 else
 big


thanks
 to
 both
 of
 you
 and
 great
 and


thanks
 for
 coming
 to
 Oso
 thank
 you
 very


much
