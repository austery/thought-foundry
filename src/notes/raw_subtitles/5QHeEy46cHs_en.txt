On the latest Masters in Business
podcast, An amazing conversation.
I sit down with Brian Timmer.
He's the director of Global Macro at
Fidelity.
They run about $16 trillion in client
assets.
They touch about 50 million separate
clients.
What an amazing conversation.
European has been started out in fixed
income before he became a market
technician.
Now global macro is his beat, which
means he covers everything U.S.
overseas equity bonds, commodities,
economic data.
I thought this conversation was
fascinating, and I think you will also
what a depth and breadth of knowledge.
With no further ado, my conversation
with Fidelity's Uri and Timmer.
Welcome to Bloomberg.
Thank you very much, Barry.
I've been looking forward to this.
I've been consuming your stuff for it
feels like forever.
I'm a big fan of what you do.
But before we get to your work at
Fidelity for the past three decades,
let's talk a little bit about your
background.
You get a Bachelors in Finance from
Babson College.
What was the original career plan?
Well, so I was born and raised on the
island of Aruba in 1962, when Aruba was
still very small and sheltered and as a
Dutch citizen, now also an American
citizen.
But, you know, generally, the the Dutch
kids would go to Holland to go to higher
education.
But I was in love with the American
culture.
I met many tourists on the beach, you
know, And so I wanted to go to the
states and do the American thing.
And then my father, who was an importer
of construction materials, etc., he had
contacts in Boston.
They said, okay, well, you should send
your your kid to Babson because it's
small.
He won't be overwhelmed as as an
international student.
And I've always wanted to be an
architect.
But then in the last year before
finishing high school, I'm like, I don't
think I'm good enough to be an
architect, so let me do business.
And I figured, you know, there's always
something you can do with a business
degree.
And so I studied finance with a minor in
investments, and then, you know, I
graduated with no work permit, right?
So I was in that place where you need to
have obviously a work permit.
So back then, I don't know if it's still
the case, but back then you got one year
practical training visa and then you had
to go, you know, get a get a real a real
visa.
And so I took literally the only job
that was offered to me in the United
States.
So I applied to every Dutch company.
I figure at least they'll have maybe
some sentimental reasons to hire a Dutch
person.
I could have worked in Holland, of
course, but I wanted to be in the
States.
So the Dutch bank ABN, which later
became ABN Amro, right, hired me.
I went to New York into their corporate
banking credit program in which I had
zero interest.
But it's like, you know, this is the job
intended, not the boss.
But you eventually become pretty senior
in the fixed income group at ABN.
Yeah.
So I was very lucky.
And again, you know, it's sort of you
take the job that's offered to you and
you make the best of it.
You know, you play the hand that's
dealt.
And literally within a few months,
ABN set up a capital markets group
because, you know, we were the the
primary dealer in New York together with
LaSalle National Bank in Chicago for the
HQ in Amsterdam, which of course was one
of the world's largest banks at the
time, and a very large Treasury book.
And so I was the person who would
execute the trades for HQ.
So I became a client of like Solomon
Brothers and Smith Barney and, you know,
Goldman Sachs, etc..
And so I got into the Wall Street game
and I learned everything about fixed
income.
And to this day, I'm, you know, like if
you're either a stock market person or a
global macro person, having a foundation
and fixed income is so important.
It's so true.
You say that some of my favorite stock
analysts began as bond analysts because
they're concerned about return of
capital, not return on capital.
And it focuses them very much on staying
away from the speculative nonsense.
And it's been very consistent over the
years.
I have a list of some favorite people in
that space.
So so you start out in fixed income.
When did technical analysis and becoming
a a CMT arise in your journey?
So I was at ABN Amro in New York for ten
years.
And so I'm, you know, I'm there
executing trades, learning about the
markets, watching my tolerate and the
Bloomberg's for still there were the
quad screens with the amber right and
you know I just I've always been a
visual person and so I started
gravitating towards charts and you know
charts are kind of the mainstay of what
I do even now, 40 years later, 40 years
later.
Yeah, it's great.
And I like to write.
I think I get that from my dad, who's a
great writer.
And so I always had this kind of urge to
put pen to paper and and to show charts.
And so I just started writing a
newsletter for the people in my universe
at the time.
And, you know, it would be like charts
from Coogee cut out, taped onto a type
report and then faxed to people like
that's what the technology was back
then.
And so it was, oh, so that's how it
started.
And then I ended up, you know, getting
the the chartered market technician,
although that may have been during the
fidelity or so.
So how did you go from ABN Amro to
Fidelity when was up?
So even so, the culture at ABN Amro
not not to spill any beans, but this was
a long time, two years ago.
30 years ago.
I didn't like where it was going.
So we even had a bank in Chicago and
they saw what a profit center in New
York was.
So they wanted to they wanted me to work
for them, become a commission salesman.
And I'm like, That's not what I do.
And just coincidentally, at that time,
Fidelity came looking around, looking
for the most obscure job in the world, a
fixed income technical analyst, right?
I mean, talk about a narrow field, very
specific.
So that was in 1994.
Around that time, you know, I was kind
of looking around and and I had two
major career highlights within six
months of each other, because in 94, I
was approached by Paul Tudor Jones's
company.
Oh, really?
And so I had a meeting with Paul in his
office downtown New York with this giant
teller on the screen.
And we were looking at the bond chart in
94, the bear market.
Right.
And he very famously had called the 87
crash before.
And he was like, is that do you think
that's a fourth wave?
And we were having that conversation.
That was great.
And then, you know, I was approached by
Fidelity and I ended up going with
Fidelity.
But the last interview of that process
was with Ned Johnson.
Oh, really?
And so I was the founder.
I spent an hour with him in his office
talking about bankers because I was
hired to go into the chart room.
And at Fidelity, nobody got into the
chat room without Ned's blessing,
because then back then, were they still
doing charts by hand?
Yep.
I mean, and so, so that, so that.
Anyway, so that's how the Fidelity
career started.
And it was it was interesting because
this is now early 95 and of course 94
was that bear market with the so-called
tequila crisis in Mexico.
And so that and the new mandate from
upstairs in 95 was we're not making any
duration bets.
You just stick to your bottom up.
You know, you look at credits and like,
I'm coming in there as a technician.
I'm like, what am I supposed to do now?
Like, there really is nothing for me to
do.
And so at that point, I kind of
reinvented myself and became multi
multiasset.
And I went to the equity side.
And anyway, so that was the when you say
multi asset, I think you're the only
person in all of finance with the title
director of global macro global means
around the world, macro means 30,000
foot view is everything out there in
your jurisdiction.
Pretty much so I don't do security
selection.
I you know we have armies of very
talented but you do stocks bonds all
crypto commodities, gold you name it
everything but it's top down as well as
economic data.
Yes, interest rates, employment, etc.
And that's how I transitioned from being
a technical strategist to being more
kind of multidisciplinary because I
quickly learned to at Fidelity as I was
roaming the halls, pitching ideas to to
portfolio managers who generally are
fundamentally oriented.
Right?
I'm like, you know, I'm it's like I'm
speaking a different language, right?
So Fidelity has always had a lot of
technical analysts and the chat room.
But I, I had to like, reinvent myself
again and pivot towards at least
speaking their language And like, you
know, a chart is a chart, right?
It can just be a bar chart of the S&P or
it could be of the p e ratio or earnings
or monetary policy.
So I figured a charts a chart.
I'm going to like weave a broader
approach to this.
And that's where kind of I came up with
the title.
So whenever I see a technician and a
fundamental analyst having a discussion
somewhere along the line, someone says,
Look, I am a technical analyst, I'm just
telling you what's going on in the
battle between supply and demand.
It's up to you to create a narrative
around that.
You tell us what's going on.
Fundamentally, I don't know, but I can
tell you who's winning the buyers or the
sellers.
Yeah, so the fundamentals tell you.
Kind of the why,
maybe the what and the why and the
technicals tell you kind of the when and
the how much it helps give you
conviction.
And generally speaking, we use technical
analysis like our equity PBMs do, like
they're obviously going to have an idea
about a company and what their long term
prospects are.
But then our technical analysts will
say, okay, well, you've rated this stock
a one meaning strong buy, but the chart
looks like hell.
Like you should be aware that what's in
what's happening is not the same as what
should be happening.
And may be it takes time, but it's like
so it's the second opinion which can be
very helpful and the other way around as
well.
Like a chart looks amazing, but it gets
a really poor fundamental ranking.
And we also have a quantitative team
that does a quant overlay as well.
So so we talked about global macro.
I'm curious, you're a Dutch citizen,
originally born and raised in Aruba, now
a citizen of the U.S.
for the past 25 years.
How does that international upbringing
affect how you see the entire world of
assets?
Yeah, it's a great question.
I do think
that I'm I've been privileged to grow up
in a very diverse environment.
Like if you look at old high school
pictures, I'm like maybe one of two
white kids in there.
Everyone else is different shades of
yellow brown.
You have all kinds of
ethnic sort of diversity.
What is the name for people from Aruba?
Well, they're Arubans, Aruban.
Is that all it is?
Yeah,
But so very, very diverse.
And and so I think and also just going
to different countries and learning
different cultures or being exposed to
them, I think it's helped me like I view
myself sort of as a global citizen.
Well, you're a globetrotter.
You're you're in the U.S., you are in
California, you're in New York, Boston.
You go on to where?
What's your next few stops?
London.
I'm flying to London on Saturday.
I'll be in Geneva after that.
And then we were just in Lake Geneva a
year ago.
Yeah.
And then actually we're going to
Holland, because my parents are they
live in The Hague.
They're celebrating their 70th wedding
anniversary.
So that's what there is, their 91 and
97.
So we've got three generations of Temer
descending on The Hague.
That's in about in about a week and a
half.
So, you know, talking about global
trials, I'm in Amsterdam for a week.
Two years ago, I feel like, oh, look how
sophisticated lam I was just a tourist
for seven days, but one of my favorite
cities.
Yeah.
And I like, I think what I feel at home
in almost any place really in the world.
And, you know, when it's hard to
understand what someone says because the
English is not their first language, you
you can kind of like you figure it out
because you just kind of used to this,
you know, this environment where
everyone's coming from different places
and and like, you know, even now, like I
run and it's is totally separate topic,
but I run a food camp at Burning Man and
it's a very global camp.
We have 90 people and we all cook meals
that we gift away to the artists there,
but we have like 30 Brazilians and we
have like French and Swiss and Mexican
people and obviously Americans.
And that like it's it's easy to do
because you just used to having all
these different cultures in the same
space.
So I'm kind of fascinated by the new I
don't love the earbuds.
They're not comfortable in my ear.
But the new air enables instant
translation.
That is Star Trek Next level is
futuristic.
I can see that saying, Oh, you want to
go to Japan or Korea?
China, here you go, knock yourself out.
So that that sort of technological
innovation is that that turns it into a
must have technology for sure.
How many languages do you speak?
I speak obviously.
Dutch is my native language, English.
I used to be totally fluent in Spanish,
but I've I've kind of lost that.
And then, of course, there is the world
language called Puppy Memento, which is
what they speak in Aruba, which is
essentially kind of a Spanish Portuguese
blend.
But if you don't know a word, you can
just say it in Dutch or English.
And it is and it's completely
accessible.
Really fascinating.
So we were talking about
what a globetrotter you are.
Let's trot around the world and talk
about various asset classes since you
began your career with bonds.
Let's let's start with bonds.
How do you see what's been going on with
Treasury yields anticipating not only
the 25 basis point we had in September,
but perhaps a couple more this year and
next?
Yeah, So so Treasury yields such an
interesting market right now.
We've been stuck sort of between four
and 5% for a while.
For a while.
And when we go above four and a half,
it's like nothing good happen.
It's like the old Fed model from the
Greenspan days comes lurching back and
it starts to wobble the stock market
because the bond yield and the equity
yield are about the same right now.
And and so that that takes you back to
the the eighties and and, you know,
mid-nineties and even the seventies and
sixties where bonds the stocks were
positively correlated instead of
negatively correlated that happened that
that began you know during the great
moderation era late nineties until Covid
basically and said that in 2022 of
course, the correlation flipped back to
positive.
It was rising yields that caused the
problem in the stock market.
And and so there's a whole broader
conversation about the 6040 but just
dealing with treasuries right now.
So as you get close to five, it really
starts to freak the stock market out.
But also the bond buyers start to emerge
because there's value, right?
I mean,
yields over two and a half percent
inflation, you're actually income is
back into fixed income.
Right.
But down at four when you have a growth
scare, kind of like I mean, I wouldn't
say it's growth scare, but there's
there's some nervousness and some I hate
the word uncertainty, but there's a lack
of clarity as to how all these things
tariffs yield FOMC plays out.
Yeah.
So so at four generally I would be a
better seller than than a buyer.
But this question of, you know, fiscal
dominance, you know, clearly the
administration wants to grow out of the
debt.
I think that's the very
overt plan for if you listen to Scott
Bessant or they're pretty explicit about
it.
And so they're trying to goose the
economy and outrun the debt because
everyone knows you can't really cut the
debt very much because too much of the
budget is under is not discretionary.
And so that's the plan.
And I think it's basically it's a good
plan because what are the alternatives,
right?
Raising taxes and cutting spending,
which we know what the odds of that.
Yes.
But running kind of that fiscal train
means deficit spending, or at least
that's part of it.
And that means more supply.
And that could mean higher term premia
for for long treasuries.
And we saw we've seen that right.
The term premium during the QE, QE
financial repression days was like -150,
which makes no sense.
A term a risk premium should always be
positive.
And now it's plus 60 plus 70.
But historically it's been plus 150 or
even more.
And so if if the term premium mean
reverts back to a normal level, positive
level, because deficit spending and debt
levels are rising, you could easily see
a five handle on Treasuries and a five
handle on Treasuries are not going to
sit well with equities like the equity
market can go up, earnings can drive the
bus, but the PE gets under pressure
because the risk free asset is now
competing with the risky asset and
they're offering the same yield.
So quick question on that.
In the 20 tens or at least towards the
end of the 20 tens, we had an inverted
yield curve for a while.
What's the impact of that on that term
premium or lack thereof?
Yeah, so we had that very inverted yield
curve.
Obviously it shouted recession and it
didn't happen.
And I think the reason in hindsight was
that the economy is just less interest
rate sensitive than it used to be.
Right?
So everyone refi their mortgage in 2020
and 21 at sub 3%.
That's also why the housing market is
frozen.
Right.
But also, if you look at the big banks,
Right.
Why is a yield curve inversion typically
bad is because banks net interest
margins goes upside down, Right.
They borrow short, lend long.
And so banks stop lending and you get a
credit crunch and you get a recession.
But in this case, the large banks, you
know, if you notice your your deposit
rate at the large mega center banks has
not really gone up commensurate with the
yield on money market funds.
Right.
So that deposit rate went up to a half a
percent and is now coming back down
again.
So for a large bank, the yield curve not
only was never inverted, it was
extremely steep, half a percent funding
rate.
If you're if you're funding your loans
on deposits and you're paying half a
percent on those deposits and you can
lend at seven or 8%, you'll do that all
day long.
And yet at the same time, we've watched
money markets go 5 trillion, 6 trillion,
7 trillion.
It's become so easy with your app to
move money from, Hey, I'm going from
Chase to Schwab.
I'm going from City to Fidelity where
I'm getting real yield.
I wonder how much technology plays a
role in people.
It used to be a pain in the neck.
Oh, I'm getting a quarter percent in my
checking account, but do I really want
to write a check and mail it out and
wait for the.
Yeah.
So.
So you leave money at the bank for
convenience.
You know, you got bills to pay, but if
you have extra cash, you're buying a CD
or money market fund or buying T-bills.
So.
What have you.
And it's a lot easier than it used to
be.
And so now you've got 7 trillion in
money market funds, which a lot of
people actually think is money waiting
to be invested in the stock market.
But I don't think there's really a
signal there because I think that money
came out of the banks and probably will
go back to the banks.
So some people have said, hey, as soon
as the Fed starts cutting rates, it'll a
make the cost of borrowing cheaper for
corporate America as well as American
households.
And B, is going to scare some of that
money away and it's got nowhere to go
but equity fear narrative for kind of a
lot of wishful thinking.
It could be a combination of both.
But if you typically look at when money
market fund assets swell like it did
during the pandemic, it's money coming
out of the stock market seeking a safe
haven.
And then when the stock market recovers,
the money goes back in the stock market.
That's not the pattern.
This year.
The money came out of the banks in part
because of like the Silicon Valley
debacle, but also 500 basis points of
rate hikes, 2022.
So money markets went from 0 to 5 and a
half, suddenly attractive and depositors
went from zero to half, you know, so
money markets yielded ten x the bank
deposit.
And so some of that may go to the stock
market, but but it didn't come from the
stock market, let me put it that way.
So you noted something really
interesting.
I remember you wrote in 2022, Bonds went
from being a port in the storm to the
storm itself.
Yes.
So normally we think of money leaving
equity and going in the safe harbor of
money markets.
Were we seeing money exiting bonds and
going to money markets?
Is that what happened?
Was it a duration play from among sort
of the typical investors?
We we have not really seen an exodus at
all.
And I think part of that is just the
demographics of, you know, the baby boom
solving for income more so than growth.
So you look at fund flows into fixed
income, they've remained strong and they
were strong at, you know, 1% and they're
strong at 4%.
So I think that is more of a structural
trend than playing the markets, if you
will.
Like I think the average investor is not
looking at, okay, well, real rates are
now positive.
So let me do this.
But they're solving for outcomes.
They're buying solutions based funds
like like our target date will have
certain amount of fixed, which has just
attracted so much money in for one case
over the past 20 years.
It's it's amazing.
So let's talk a little bit about
equities.
I keep hearing people complain about
valuations, but if you stayed out of
equities due to elevated valuations, you
miss most of this run from the 2013
breakout.
Yes.
So
so the market obviously is very
bifurcated.
We've got the Mach seven, the cap
weighted PE is, you know, 23, 24, the
equal weighted P is 18.
So there's a very large gap there.
You know, if you look back at the mid to
late nineties, which is a kind of an
analogous period to today.
Right, we had the the 94 stealth bear
market when Greenspan raised rates 300
basis points, then he gave back 75 and
we had a huge rally and it was also the
start of the Internet boom.
You know, the Netscape IPO I think was
like in 96.
Yeah.
So the post 2022 periods, very analogous
to post 1994, you know, soft landing is
off the brakes, markets, markets rip and
then the post 98 long term capital.
Yeah that you know 22% decline very
robust recovery and then Greenspan eases
three times into that recovery.
We're seeing the same thing now.
We had a 21% tariff tantrum, Right?
No recession.
You know, the kind of the administration
backed off very, very strong, one of the
strongest ever recovers from a 20%
decline other than 1998.
And then now Powell is easing into that.
And so but the point is that that period
saw almost nonstop, multiple expansion.
And that's what we've seen since 2022.
And, you know, these are they have they
are strong predictors of long term
returns.
So if you take a ten year cap ratio and
you've regressed that against ten year
forward returns, you see a very high
you know, it explains the forward
returns very well.
But over the near term, a high P has
very little to say about the next year
or two.
And this is because the market tends to
be in a rising trend.
Momentum begets momentum.
And that's what what we're in.
So it's it's a you know, it's a tough
game to time.
On the mean reversion of PS Either way,
even though we know that historically
it's between ten and 30 and it does mean
revert but when the mean revert
reversion starts and from what level is.
Very, very difficult to do, especially
during secular trends, which I think
we're very clearly in.
So, so many different places to go with
this.
I have a dozen questions.
Maybe we'll go a little long the segment
and delve deeper into equities.
I love the concept of a secular bull
market as opposed to a cyclical, but I
think a lot of people don't really
understand the difference.
Give us your definition of what is a
secular bull market when this one began
and why.
Yeah, so we have so we have the market
cycle, which is generally driven by the
business cycle.
So you have a recession and you have the
early cycle recovery where things get
less bad.
And of course the market is always
anticipating that the market's always in
price discovery and this is why at
bottom price will lead earnings, which
is why the PE always goes up in the
first year of a bull market like it
always does.
And it doesn't make sense on the
surface.
People are like, Oh, this can't be real.
It's all driven.
Where are the earnings for the markets
just from growing the earnings?
Yeah, but then there are the secular
trends and you know, if you go back 100
years, you can see them,
you can spot them very easily because
the market has a kind of central trend
line plus 10% nominal plus seven, six
and three quarters real.
And if you run a regression trend line
against the total real return of the S&P
or some basket of stocks going back 150
years, it's like perfect.
And then you have the pendulum swinging
above it and below it.
So you have very noisy, but still the
overall trend is being maintained.
You have these super cycles where you're
outperforming the trend line.
So the eighties and nineties was one of
those.
So instead of a 10% return, we got 18%
returns for like eight years, the
fifties and sixties after World War two,
the twenties, that was a truncated one,
but from 20 to 29, boy, did that thing
go.
And since oh nine is where I put it,
other technicians generally disagree
with me.
They think it was 2013.
When you look at the Cape model, you
look at deviation from trend, you look
at the slope of those early trend lines.
For me, it's oh nine, which puts us at
16 and of course, and then you have the
secular bear markets, right?
So the 2000 was one of the 1970s, very
famous, of course, 1930s.
Doesn't mean the market necessarily goes
down, but it it's underperforming that
10% trend line.
And generally in real terms, it's
probably going down.
And so that's kind of how I define the
secular trend.
So we are in agreement on so much stuff.
I'm going to circle back to oh nine and
push back a little bit.
But you mentioned that first year you
get a spike as the market anticipates
improving earnings.
One of the things that's kind of
fascinating is to see how much of a bull
markets gains are attributable to not
improving fundamentals, but multiple
expansion from 82 to 2000 was it three
quarters of the gains were multiple
expansion.
How much of that is psychology and how
much of that is just people getting on
board late in as the market rallies?
It it's it's both.
But yeah, for instance, in 82 the PE was
like seven and in 2000 and what was a
yields in 82 is double digits, almost
20% competition.
And then in 2000, yes, exactly.
And in 2000 the P was 35 using operating
earnings that that was the forward PE.
Actually the trailing feels like 45.
So that's a hell of a pendulum swing.
Yeah.
And you know, obviously 1982 inflation
was very high.
The at the malaise of in the economy
bonds were very competitive.
Nobody wanted to pay for earnings.
The death of equities was the few years
early on.
Death of equities.
Yes, for sure.
And then people become more comfortable
and then they go from comfortable to
confident.
And then it's like, yeah, I'm going to
pay.
I'm going to pay 20 or 25 times these
earnings.
And then of course, then you have to
gross the growth stocks.
So the late nineties obviously were, you
know, I used to call them the Janice 20.
There was a fund which as I recall the
most stocks.
And so remember the Ryan net net fund.
Yes, exactly.
And of course right now it's the Mag
seven formerly known as the as the
fangs.
And those are secular growers.
Right.
And there is a theme, right?
It was Internet back then, It's air now
and people get onto the onto the
bandwagon and it's like, yeah, you know,
I'll pay 35 times earnings for a company
that is in this space and is going to
grow their earnings in a secular way,
not a cyclical way.
And so it's totally plausible and
understandable, but at the end it goes
too far.
And I don't think we're we're anywhere
close to that.
But then you start looking for signs of
froth.
But yeah, but that's that's the pendulum
swing.
So.
So let's talk about oh nine.
And why so many of your technical
brethren dated to 2013, which was when
all of the major indices broke out over
their prior trading range.
So the pushback I hear to oh nine is,
well, that's like dating the 82 to 2000
bull market to the lows in 73, 74.
And you're still all you're doing over
that period is recovering.
The sell off today are what we were down
56 57% from October seven to March nine.
And then to get back to where you were
in oh seven.
It took till 2013.
Yeah.
So.
So why only as opposed to 13?
It's totally legit argument.
But I would say a couple of things.
One is this is not an exact science,
right?
There's only been two or three or four
secular bull markets, right?
Small data says small data set.
It's it's not a quant model.
You have to look at the chart at the
slope.
So I date the secular bull market
from the fifties.
I date at 49.
Even though 49 was not the low right of
the low was 3646, something like that.
But in 49, something changed and the
slope started to, you know, like the
market found itself and that trajectory
started to really compound at double
digits.
And you broke out of that big shelf that
was really from 29 all the way to 4970.
The low was, of course, in 74 October
74, after 48% bear market.
We had some other little cycles, but
then in 82 it took off.
That was a change in the fundamentals
code.
Volcker broke inflation.
And so and then you look at the so then
I get verification from the
fundamentals.
So then so I look at the charts and yes,
I see the argument and I agree it's a
good point.
But in oh nine, the market just went
straight up.
After a decade of sideways.
In 82, the market went straight up after
a decade of sideways in 49.
Same thing, whether the low was in or
not.
And of course, in real terms, the 82 low
was below the 74 lows.
So because of inflation, you really felt
so, so, so.
So I want to get second opinions from
the real chart and from the
fundamentals.
So the Cait model, again, where you
compare the ten year P to the ten year
forward return, looks very similar at
the oh nine and not similar at the 13
when the market already had a lot of
momentum.
And then the other thing I look at it
again that 150 year regression trend
line of the real S&P in 50 years.
Yeah.
And so at the at secular peaks the
market is about 100% above the trend
line.
And at secular troughs it's about 50%
below.
So that point was in oh nine, it was not
in 13.
So, so I look at that at like the weight
of the evidence from a multitude of
indicators.
And again, it's not an exact science.
I'm not saying I'm right, they're wrong,
but that's for me, that's where I get.
But you've been a whole lot more right
than than many other people.
And it's interesting.
So in oh nine, you know, I was actually
running a fund back then, a kind of a
global macro fund.
And I was like, the market was so
depressed.
Right?
So remember March of oh nine?
Sure.
Of course.
And I'm like, you know, I want to be
long,
but what if I'm wrong?
And I'm like, at this point, if I'm
wrong, so what?
You're already down 50 cut in half.
But at that point, the whole system is
going to collapse.
So it's like, why?
Why not?
Why not bet at that point?
And so, yeah, when is down more than 50%
in U.S.
markets?
Not a great entry point.
I mean, that's one thing.
But I have to ask you a question about
oh nine.
So I was looking through some of my old
notes as I was preparing for this.
And, you know, I'm curious as to your
thoughts on some of the behavioral
aspects, including sentiment and bull
bear ratios.
I wrote something up in October nine
calling that recovery the most hated
bull market in market history.
Markets went straight up.
Everybody was miserable.
It's a head fake.
It's a false breakout.
This is all going to be a disaster.
And if you listen to those people, you
left a ton of money on the table.
What's your thought on that extreme
sentiment in one direction or the other
and just what it means when everybody
hates a particular asset class?
It's obviously an opportunity because
that means that everyone is not on the
same side of the boat.
Right.
And I actually and what I saw, they're
all on the wrong side of the boat.
But before I answer the rest of that, I
wasn't what I was going.
Say earlier was when you run the
regression of the oh nine to present
S&P, either in real or nominal terms and
you run the same regression from 82 to
2000 from 49 to 68.
It's exactly the same slope.
And so if in 09i got bullish and in 13
I'm like, Yeah.
Now we've taken out the high, so now we
can say this bull market is confirmed.
So the 13 for me is not the start, but
it's confirmation.
But if I had looked at nothing else for
the for the next, you know, 12 years
today I would be within 10% of that
slope having materialized.
And so, again, you're never going to do
that on a secular chart.
Do you want to have weight of the
evidence?
But it shows you how powerful that
context can be to just look at those
different timeframes and see where they
are, because it'll keep you on the right
side of the market.
So last question on equities.
Given the 49 to 66 rally, the 82 to 2000
and then the oh nine forward, how much
legs does this secular bull market have?
Can can this go another five, six, seven
years?
And the other related question is how
much of a reset does that giant fiscal
stimulus of 20 2122 build into into
markets?
It's it's a great question.
And so on the surface, if it were six
years in, the last two were eight years.
But again, sample size of two, like you
can't go with that.
Right.
But the cap model again, which has been
a very good long term model in terms of
the ten year cure for the market
suggests that the so the the p the the
growth rate in the P peaked in 19 for
obvious reasons because it's a ten year
model.
So oh nine rolls off and then you know
you have that peak and we've been
holding steady at around you know 14
15%, ten year cagrs that actually has
another peak in about like 2026, seven,
eight.
My guess is that that acceleration will
be an air bubble or it could be where
it's just like, you know, the air boom,
the max seven.
Like all of a sudden everyone's buying
companies with no earnings because
they're promising to be the next killer
app and that sort of the next Pets.com.
Yes.
And my guess is that if we are heading
into a fiscally dominant era or we're in
it already, so we had 5 trillion of
helicopter money in 2020, we now have
another $5 trillion fiscal bill.
If the next Fed post-poll is going to be
just more dovish than the economics
suggest, in order to fund that to help
fund that debt, then you could see
inflation, you know, be structurally
higher than 2%, maybe 3 to 4.
And if that and if the ten year yield at
that point goes to a five handle because
the term premium is back, you can easily
see a scenario where in a few years,
again, that Fed model principle of
rising yields bringing down the PPI is
going to be the thing that flattens that
secular slope.
That doesn't mean like a 2000 like bear
market.
It doesn't have to mean that, but it
could just be a flattening.
Instead of running at two x the ten year
rate of change, maybe you're at half X
or something like that.
So generally speaking, when you see an
elevated cape, it's not a sell signal,
it's really a signal.
Lower your future return expectations.
Things are going to be a little more a
little less easy sledding.
Yes, I think the next ten years will be
less less robust than the last.
But it doesn't mean they have to be
negative at all.
You mentioned the eighties into the
nineties in the post-World War two era.
It's kind of fascinating to look at
rolling 15 year periods the 15 years
following oh nine is the third best 15
year period in history.
It's really amazing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, so let's talk a little bit about the
current environment.
You look at more than just stocks and
bonds.
You look at a lot of economic data as
well and chart that.
So how do you think where we are in the
current economic cycle?
How do you describe our location in the
business cycle?
So generally speaking, the economy
remains pretty solid.
People are employed, their wages are
exceeding the inflation rate.
At this point,
debt levels are not high, at least as a
percent of GDP.
Right?
So the household debt to GDP ratio
peaked during the financial crisis.
It's pretty modest.
And it's yeah, it was 100% of GDP is now
70.
So there's a debt issue on the
government's balance sheet.
But but not in the household or even the
core.
For balance.
Even the government side is in our debt
to GDP ratio, like half of Japan,
something like that.
So about 120%, if it's just a federal
debt, if you add all other debt, it's
about 250.
But it's comparable to other regions.
But certainly Japan gets the prize and
China as well.
And just in terms of the growth rate of
the China, oh, okay.
Not total, but yeah, China has been
growing debt and the Chinese provinces
have been growing debt as well.
And the Chinese numbers, of course, are
can be a little vague because the
federal debt in China is not high.
But they have the four big policy banks
that are essentially providing
liquidity.
And so you have to add that.
And so China and Japan are the worst
offenders.
The U.S.
is is on par with most kind of European
and other other countries.
But so anyway, so so that the economy
looks pretty good.
But, you know, one of the things that
COVID did was it sort of upended a lot
of the things we think about when we
look at the at the economic cycle and
the business cycle.
So, you know, of course, we know what
happened.
The economy froze, people got laid off.
And then at least in the U.S., the
economy came back really fast, faster
than in other places.
And the labor wasn't there.
Right.
The baby boomers had checked out.
They left the labor force.
Of course, the borders were closed.
And I remember like I was I was doing a
lot of flying back to L.A.
at the time because I was hiding in
Santa Barbara because the office was
closed.
And it's like like the counter at
JetBlue in Boston was like they just did
not have enough people.
People were coming back.
Like everyone was like, okay, we're
back.
But they weren't.
There wasn't the supply chains weren't
there.
And so we had this very tight labor
market that of course, we would hear
about all the time, you know, from the
jobs report to job openings for every
job seeker, that sort of thing.
And that has been worked off over the
last few years.
I think that was the goal of the
tightening policy or part of the goal.
So when you look at the jobs report, you
look at the U3 jobless rate relative to
NAIRU, the non-accelerating rate of
employment,
everything is in balance like it's right
at that zero line.
So the supply, is that why we've kind of
been hanging around for three, four,
two?
So unemployment, so no one's hiring, but
not many people are looking for jobs and
not a lot of people getting laid off.
No.
And so there's balance, right?
They're job seekers versus the job
providers.
But you look at that chart over 50 years
and you can see that there is a pendulum
swing of that business cycle.
So we went from very tight to neutral
and you know, like the inclination is to
look at that and it's like, well, every
other time that's happened, the next
phase is contraction.
Yeah.
And I think that's what the bond market
is saying.
That's, I think where the Fed's coming
from.
Now that they did the 25, they're
looking at the job, started looking at
the revision, write the jobs report
revision the big downward revision most
of nine on 11,000 jobs and they're like,
okay, you know, we should we should
build in some some cushion for that.
And so I think that's generally the
vibe.
But other than that, you know, we have a
whole economics team that looks at the
business cycle and we're not really
seeing a lot of red flags other than
that yellow flag.
If you how closely does the market cycle
track the business cycle?
Because, you know, I've heard it said so
many times the market is not the economy
and vice versa.
And the old joke is the stock market is
forecast nine of the last four
recessions.
How do you see the that overlay?
There is, of course, a connection,
right?
If you look at GDP growth and
inventories, I mean, it's less about
that now than it was decades ago, the
impact of monetary policy.
But, you know, the markets are not the
economy.
There is a reflection because if the
economy grows, earnings are going to
grow and then, you know, the market's
going to go up because price follows
earnings.
But there's a sentiment equation in the
stock market that, of course, you don't
have so much in the economic cycle and
and you have the timing right.
So the market is always going to
anticipate future changes.
So you have a chart showing markets
bottom eight months below profits.
So you can that's a huge lead time,
eight months.
So you could be 100% correct about the
economic cycle and be 100% wrong about
the market leaders, because if it's
already been reflected right and if it's
already have has even over earned
against that future signal, then you're
buying yesterday's miss.
But yes, so the market generally at
bottoms will bottom two or three
quarters before earnings that happened
during COVID.
And I remembered like it was yesterday
because during COVID, you know, the
market fell 35% February, March, then
like late March, it bottomed and I think
20.
And I think by June it was at new highs,
Right.
69% for the year from the lows.
Yeah, which is amazing.
And people like the economists had a
cover saying this is divorced from
reality and everyone.
And so it's my job A to have people not
sell in the first place to be to be the
long term investor.
You know, the way I always describe it
is you're getting a really juicy ten 11%
return by investing in stocks.
But the price of admission is you got to
endure some volatility.
And if you can't stand the price, then
you don't get the reward.
How do you explain to clients, and I got
a million calls, man, this market has
become disconnected from reality.
What's your explanation to that?
So.
So that what what happened?
It happened after the financial crisis,
right?
So price bottoms, the market bets on
recovery and it could be wrong.
Right.
Price discovery doesn't mean the market
knows everything.
And that's one thing where I sometimes
disagree with technicians who say
markets are always right.
So what?
The market's not always right, but the
market's always right in discounting
everything that's knowable.
Right.
So it's right in that.
But it doesn't mean that that what it's
discounting can't change.
Right.
And we saw this during the tariff
tantrum in April.
The market was pricing in a left tail
that never arrived.
And now and then it had to on price it.
So but so the market looks ahead and the
market bottomed in March of oh nine.
Earnings didn't bottom until the third
or fourth quarter.
Same thing during COVID march bottomed
in March of 2020.
Earnings recover its third or fourth
quarter.
And and so you have so you can't look at
the news and say, how can the market be
here when the earnings or like people
are dying?
So how did you explain this to clients?
I'm curious.
I explained it exactly that way, that
the price always leads and you can't
look at it in sort of a linear way.
You have to just
you have to know that at an inflection
points, the price action is going to
make no sense.
And this is why people, you know, sell
at bottoms and buy a tops, because they
are they're trying to understand the
narrative.
And that narrative is not the one that
that is ruling the roost at the time.
One of the things that we found was
useful was explaining to clients that
their life experience isn't market cap
weighted.
When you look at what's driving the big
indexes, it was back then, it was the
FAANG.
Now we call it the Magnificent Seven.
But we did a calculation and found out
that if all the airlines, all the
hotels, all the local retailers, like
just a run of the worst businesses
during the pandemic, if they just
disappeared, tomorrow was 6% of the S&P
500.
And, you know, or Apple or Microsoft,
it's like it's amazing how how our daily
experience is so different from what
markets are like.
And we had that during Brexit in 2016.
I mean, that was constantly the
headlines.
What about Brexit?
Why is the the U.S.
market ignoring it as well?
Because well, because the U.K.
is 3% of S&P revenue is that's why, you
know, so and so that raises really
interesting question about the U.S.
versus the rest of the world in terms of
economic activities.
So the S&P 500 just gets just about half
of its revenue from overseas for most of
the past 15 years.
The U.S.
side of consumer spending, business
spending, government spending has been
very supportive of the domestic side of
the S&P 500.
Kind of feels like that's shifting a
little bit.
We're seeing a little slow down on
consumer spending, a little slow down on
economic activity here as Europe and
Asia seem to be starting to finding
their footing after about ten years.
Can we just pass off the baton without
the S&P stumbling?
Is that is that possible?
It's possible.
And it's actually happening right now.
And this is one of the areas that I'm
most excited about right now is that
this U.S.
bull market has become a global bull
market.
You look at AM stocks, Chinese stocks,
Europe, Japan.
And it's very exciting because, you
know, for many years, right.
The U.S.
exceptionalism train has been running
since 20 1415 and the rest of the world
was always so tempting with its lower
valuation.
And I I've had conversations, we all
with our asset allocation PMS for years
saying looks like, yeah, I can I could
buy if I were I'm at 1414.
It's like it's cheap for a reason
though.
It's cheap for a reason.
The market's very efficient
but for the but so the catalyst so you
need a catalyst to make the mean
reversion in valuation to trigger that.
And the catalyst is always going to be
related to earnings, like if you look at
the relative performance, U.S.
versus non-U.S.
over the past ten years, it's exactly
the same as a relative earnings line.
It's the same thing.
So you need something to change in the
on the earnings side, and that's
changing.
So we have, of course, a very
concentrated market in the U.S.
and that does pose risks, right?
I mean, if if those seven stocks go
down, guess what?
The S&P is going to go down even if 70%
of the stocks in the S&P are going up.
If you're an indexer or you're buying an
ETN spy, you're not going to feel those
gains because those top seven stocks are
taking the index down.
And so it was so for the last year or
so, it was a question of how do you
diversify against concentration risk?
Do you go down capped, you buy the
Russell 2000.
But now the answer's easier because now
you have a catalyst, a fundamental
catalyst that is causing the mean
reversion to happen between U.S.
and non-U.S.
stocks and where that's coming from.
Is that so?
I'm a big fan of the discounted cash
flow model, the DCF, which looks at not
so much earnings, but the payout of
earnings.
So if you have earnings growth of 10%
and 70% of those earnings are being
returned to shareholders as dividends or
buybacks, the payout is that 70% and the
payout ratio is 70%.
And for the U.S., it's always been a
very dominating scenario where the
payout in the U.S.
is very strong because of all the share
buybacks we have here.
Where are we today with that?
Are we still seeing the same sort of
share buybacks?
Because it seems like we haven't been
hearing a lot of announcements, but that
doesn't mean it's nothing.
We don't hear a lot.
But the buybacks at record highs, 300
billion over the last 12 months and the
payout ratio is 75% for the S&P.
But guess what?
The payout for IFA, which is non-U.S.
developed stocks,
the payout ratio is also 75%.
It always used to be lower because they
don't do buybacks over there.
They do dividends, but now they're doing
more buybacks.
And the growth rate in the payout itself
over the last five years is now higher
in IFA than in the U.S.
So you're getting equal or superior or
at least competitive fundamentals at at
a fraction of the valuation.
And that that is a good that's a good
deal.
And so that's so finally that that part
is working where the pond that we're
fishing from is now broader.
And for me, kind of it's a barbell
strategy.
I don't want to be short the max seven
because they can get bigger, right?
And you don't want to miss out on that.
But rather than going down cap in the
U.S., go overseas, do a barbell of max
seven and non-U.S.
stocks, then you can play the dollar
with dollar weakening story.
You can get equally good fundamentals
for a 15 PE instead of a 24 PE.
And to me, that's that's that's a good
that's a good thing right now.
So so the last two things I want to talk
to you about in terms of the current
environment are inflation and sentiment.
And I'm not sure how much of this is
related.
You know, when we see the Michigan
sentiment data, it seems to be so awful
and it just doesn't feel like, is this
really worse than the financial crisis,
worse than Covid, worse than the dot com
implosion in 911 or worse than the 87
crash?
If you follow the sentiment data, it's
saying yes, just doesn't feel that way.
No, it doesn't.
And I think the sentiment data,
obviously they're very bifurcated by
political belief.
Right.
You know and I seen those charts are
really useful and I spend time on both
coasts.
And, you know, I was at a dinner party
in Modesto, California, a few weeks ago,
and people were like, how can everything
look so good when we're like at the end
of the world type of thing, right?
And then I'll be in some other place and
it'll be the total opposite.
But I think a lot of the sentiment data
are still driven by the inflation data.
Like obviously the inflation rate has
come down to 2.8%, but everything
remains more expensive that that, you
know, that COVID spike, you know, that
has not been unwound.
And one of and that's one of the things
I worry about, because not not to make a
comparison to the 1970s, which obviously
was the great inflation in long term.
But during the fifties and sixties,
inflation was super low 2%.
Then you to the second half of the
sixties, it started to creep up and then
it came back down.
But in order to for the average to be at
2%, if you go to 6%, you then need to go
below two for the average to be two.
And we haven't done that.
We went from two to 9 to 2.8, right.
And we never went below two.
And if we for some reason get another
upswing and we're at three and four,
like that five year number is now going
to be at four or 5%.
And I think that's what's driving a lot
of it, is it certainly did during COVID
and it's things.
It's like food, right?
So, you know, like the beef prices are
up and prices have come back down, but
beef prices have run away.
So I think a lot of it has to do with
that because, you know, people are
employed.
Wages are competitive right now.
And, you know, unemployment rates 4.3%.
But I think it's just that that cost of
living, it just kind of like grinds
right now and has been grinding for five
years now.
So let's talk about that 2% target.
You know, in the 20 tens, an era of
concerns about deflation and monetary
stimulus, 2% seemed like a reasonable
number.
Is that still a reasonable number?
Now that and that was an upside target.
Yeah, right.
You were at 1% aiming for two.
Now we're at two and a half, three
aiming back at to maybe in an era of
fiscal stimulus.
Two and a half, 3% makes more sense.
I mean, I'm not a monetarist, but I
don't know why the whole world changes
except for our inflation.
There's nothing magical about two.
Like if you go back 150 years again, the
average inflation rate is like 3%, 2.8.
If you look at a distribution of equity
piece and the inflation rate, the sweet
spot is sort of 1 to 4.
Right.
So whether you're at three or two, it's
like for the stock market doesn't
matter.
Does it matter like 1010 to do it like
that, nine, nine matter that matters.
And that distribution is interesting
because obviously the higher the
inflation rate goes, the lower the P.
Which makes perfect sense because if
inflation goes up, bond yields go up,
then the safe asset is very competitive
with the risky assets.
So why take the risk?
Plus the cost of capital goes up.
If you go to the left tail deflation,
there is really no correlation.
Nobody likes deflation.
So so from that angle, two and a half is
not a problem.
Even three is not a problem.
I think the Fed worries that if they
were to ever admit that, you know,
inflate inflation expectations could get
unanchored.
But they went to the 80 thing where the
average inflation targeting
and actually that actually prevented
them from raising rates when they should
have back in 2021.
And two, they were late to the party to
raise and they seem like they were late
to the party to cut it.
Yeah.
So their policy was we need to see the
whites in the eyes of inflation before
we raise rates.
And and by the time the whites of the
eyes were visible, it was like too late.
You know, inflation was at five going to
nine.
But so, you know, it's a nuance thing.
But again, 3% is not going to be the end
of the world.
It just means that bonds have a term
premium and stock market is still fine.
Maybe the PE is like 17 instead of 19,
But like, you know, if earnings are
doing the heavy lifting, it doesn't
matter.
But again, it's like what?
What will it take for the Fed to
actually say that or will they ever say
it, or will we just have a post Powell
Fed that says, you know, instead of
neutral being inflation plus 100 neutral
is inflation.
And and you know, so there are three
instead of four or something.
So so I see your charts everywhere.
Not only are they all over social media,
but you do regular chart packs.
I love your monthly chart pack.
I'm going to flip open my laptop and
let's look at some of your favorite
charts and I'll make these available on
YouTube and and on the website when when
this posts.
Let's start with market cycles and what
we see going back to around our birth
date
is just a series of long bull markets
followed by shorter, shallower bear
markets.
Tell us about this market cycle chart
and what are the different shading means
in blue and red?
What what's the significance of that?
Yeah, so so the shadings are is the
valuation, the five year cap ratio, when
it starts to get pricey, it turns out it
turns red.
Yeah.
And so what the top part of the chart
shows are the market cycles.
So the Green Hour, you know, the bull
markets, of course, cyclical bull
markets, the red are the bear markets.
And you can see as we as we talked about
earlier, they're really it's pretty rare
for a 50% drawdown.
There's only been really a couple of
them.
And so what this shows is that the
current bull market, as strange as it or
as unusual as it has felt for many
people, actually is pretty garden
variety, right?
88% gain over 35 months.
So it's pretty pretty average.
But then when you look at the bottom
panel, it shows the relative the
percentage of stocks outperforming the
index.
And now you see something pretty
unusual, something we've only seen a few
times in history.
And that is, of course, the
concentration effect of the max seven.
And before that, the.
Thanks.
And it is the market is as concentrated
as it was in the late nineties and the
early to mid seventies, which was the
original Nifty 50 period.
And so, you know, for
for it indexer I guess it doesn't matter
for an active manage active investor it
does, but even for an index or it does
because the largest stocks are getting
bid up whether they deserve it or not.
Of course they're large because they
deserve to be generally, but it shows
you how narrow the market has been
during this cycle.
And so it's it's just a way of
describing kind of where we are.
So you get the cyclical on the top and
the bottom speaks more to the secular.
Really interesting.
Let's go to
debt dynamics, which is kind of
interesting, a footnote.
I have to go for this.
Do they pass it already?
No.
So this next one.
There it is.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
So let's talk about debt dynamics, which
shows the change in federal debt versus
what?
So what this chart shows and it's a very
simple chart, but it's I think it speaks
volumes, is that, you know, during
COVID, we kind of, I think, entered the
fiscal lead dominant era where debt
financing or deficit spending becomes a
very major tool, which is definitely
different from the financial crisis.
When we actually had austerity after the
financial crisis with the Tea Party
movement.
Now we have the opposite.
And in the initial years after that
fiscal expansion started, the Fed was
actually doing a lot of the heavy
lifting by putting those bonds or not
those bonds, but putting bonds on its
balance sheet.
So you could see the rise in debt is is
largely accommodated by an expanding
balance sheet.
Since that time, since 2022, the Fed has
gone into quantitative tightening mode
where it's shrinking its balance sheet,
but the debt just keeps going up.
So the debt is now up about 14 trillion
in the last five years, and only about
two and a half of that is sort of been
absorbed by the Fed.
So I put two and two together and say,
okay, if that purple line at the top
just keeps going up,
who's going to buy this, right?
And who's going to buy the debt?
And will the Fed be forced
back into playing a bigger role in kind
of mopping up that supply?
And that's the fiscal dominance thing.
That's a little bit of modern monetary
theory, is that the Fed can just buy up
all the debt and there's no constraints
whatsoever.
So MA stands for what system open market
account.
So that's what the Fed has on its
balance sheet.
So that went up since the financial
crisis and it's come down since 20.
It's the part of the Fed's balance sheet
that is sort of the QE part, if you
will.
All right.
So let's talk a little bit about equity,
supply and demand.
What are we looking at?
This chart back to 1986.
Is this simply liquidity driven or
what's going on here?
So I think this is and it's not a lot of
people talk about this, but I think this
is one of the fundamental drivers of the
current secular bull market era.
And so you can see on the chart, I
started the clock at the bottom in oh
nine, which again I believe is the start
of the secular bull market.
And I look at just the supply and demand
of equities just from within the
corporate America structure.
So not investor flows, but how much were
there in IPOs and secondary issues.
And it's a couple of trillion.
How much was share buybacks and how much
was M&A and share buybacks and M&A have
something in common in that it's
corporates buying shares of other
corporates and those shares get retired,
right?
So that's the demand for shares.
And what you see is if you look at the
supply demand ratio, like it's very
unbalanced, like it's the demand far
exceeds the supply.
And to me this has been one of the
important drivers for driving returns in
a secular bull market.
And there's no signs that this is this
is letting up.
And so when we when we think about what
inning is the secular bull market in,
when is it going to end and why, This is
one of the things I look at.
It's just, you know, when when you're
retiring far more shares than you
issuing, it's like, duh, you know,
markets are going to go up, all else
being equal.
What's so surprising about this is how
relatively insignificant the retail
flows are.
Yes, they are.
It's it's just the opposite of how so
many people describe it.
Yeah.
Let's talk about us fundamentals versus
ether fundamentals.
So this looks at various market data
buybacks, dividends, etc..
Um, tell us what this chart is showing
us.
Yes, it is.
We were talking about earlier about
there finally being a catalyst for
non-U.S.
stocks to compete with the US with the
max seven driven U.S.
stock market.
And so on the left, I show the earnings
line for the S&P, the payout so that the
share of earnings being returned, quote
unquote to shareholders, shareholder
yield as dividends and buybacks.
And then at the bottom, you see that the
payout ratio again, either as dividends
in the yellow, buybacks in the purple,
and you can see that the payout has
risen very nicely, almost a double
since, oh, since five years ago.
Payout ratio is about 75%.
So very bullish fundamentals like you,
you know, those fundamentals deserve a
high, high PE, right, because not only
is are the earnings growing, but they're
being returned to shareholders, which of
course is worth more than if you're not
getting them back.
It's just the present value of future
cash flows.
But what's changed just in the last few
years is that for EFA again, which is
the.
See, I non-U.S.
developed index.
You see an even better growth rate in
the payout and you see it more than
double.
Yeah.
And you see an equally robust payout
ratio, again, of about 75%.
So the rest of the world is really
competitive now, despite the fact that
this is such a Mag seven heavy market.
And so this is, you know, just a very
exciting time because you can actually
you don't have to make that make or
break binary decision like you're either
in these big stocks or you're left
behind.
There are other places to get those
returns down.
What's so fascinating about this chart
is how inverted the ratio of buybacks to
dividends is.
In the U.S., 45% of shareholder yield is
buybacks, 30% are dividends.
That flips In Europe, it's 47% or
dividends, only 27% are buybacks or I
should say e for not just Europe,
although a lot of it seems to be
concentrated in Europe.
Yes.
How much of that is just driven by tax
policy and regulations?
I think it's largely culture.
It's just, you know, and Europe is more
of a value market, right?
So it's really like the banks are really
running the show right now.
And so the U.S., it's more the growth
stocks.
So they don't want to so, you know,
dividends are kind of like a sacred
contract, if you will like it takes a
lot for dividends to be cut.
So I think Europe and Japan has just
generally been more of a of a value
driven and the culture has been more,
okay, we're going to earn so much and
you're going to get that back as
dividends, but especially the Japanese
and also the Europeans are getting much
more with the shareholder culture now in
terms of unlocking value and and
returning those as as buybacks.
So it's they're getting they're starting
to play it again.
Last few questions before we get to our
favorite questions.
Um, you have a section in the chart book
about the post 6040 world.
I've heard people say the old 6040 is
now 50, 30, 20 or 5030 1055.
Tell us what you think of as the post
6040 world.
So I look at it, I call it the 6020 20.
So the 6040 paradigm worked like a charm
right from the late nineties until the
early 2020s
and you know, 60% S&P 40% Bloomberg AG
So the investment grade bond index and
you've got a 9% Kaga against the 9% vol
and like what's not to like about that
right it during that time inflation was
like two and a half so you got a very
attractive real return with really
moderate volatility.
But the whole premise of that paradigm
was that the 40 was insurance against
the 60.
So the 60, of course, is always the
anchor.
That's where the compounding is.
And the 40 would be your port in the
storm.
I think that's now changed.
So 2022 obviously was a return to the
old Fed model days where rising yields
take, you know, take take the mojo out
of the stock market, to put it mildly.
The good news is that bonds, of course,
now are a viable asset.
They generate a positive real yield, but
their correlation is now positive
against equities instead of negative.
So when I think about the post 6040
world, I'm less worried about the 60.
Like we can add more international in
the 60 and like we were just discussing,
but what do we do about the 40 if the 40
can be the cause of problems rather than
the solution to problems?
And especially if we end up with a
higher term premium, then bonds are not
going to be as as safe as they used to
be.
So then I get into kind of, okay, I'm
going to take some share from the bonds.
It doesn't have to be 20.
Like, again, this is not investment
advice, but back of the envelope stuff
and, you know, maybe some cash
strategies are more competitive if we're
not going to go back to the zero
interest rate days, which I don't think
we are.
Gold are the proven anti bond over
history, right?
They don't produce a cash flow, 3700
bucks as we speak.
But when bonds do poorly, gold really
shines, no pun intended.
And then you got to throw Bitcoin in
there as kind of the want to be
exponential gold.
And then other strategies like
alternatives, right?
Managed futures, equity, long short
private credit, you know, all of those
kind of alpha rather than beta
strategies you have, you have tips in
there as well.
Yeah.
Tips, high yield,
you know, markets or asset classes that
are not negatively correlated, but
they're not positively correlated as
well.
So when you look at kind of the Sharpe
ratios versus the.
Correlation not just to to 60, but
especially to the 40.
Right?
Because I want to hedge more against the
40 than the 60.
I was going to say this doesn't look
like a yield chase.
This looks like a diversifier.
Is that's the thinking here.
Yeah.
And actually, if you go down one chart I
think.
Yeah, right.
You look at that.
So I want high Sharpe ratios or high
super high sortino ratios and and and
assets that are uncorrelated.
Then you get into, you get into the B
com commodities, you get into gold.
C Bitcoin is not quite uncorrelated but
all the old strategies are uncorrelated.
And so to me that is sort of the next
6040 really, really fascinating.
Last question before we get to our
favorites.
You look at so many charts each week,
you identify trends for a lot of people
do what are investors not talking about
but perhaps should be what topics,
assets, geographies, data points, What
do you think is getting overlooked but
is really worth investors time to pay
attention to one asset class and we just
talked about it that I think generally
is seen as a as a side show the way
Bitcoin used to be.
It's no longer a sideshow for sure is
actually gold, because for even at 3700
bucks, it's well, people still think of
it as a sideshow.
I think institutions do it right.
So regular retail investors as as I call
them, you know, you can buy gold or some
other or gold ETF and like, you know, I
own it in my portfolio.
And so they're I think they're it's part
of the conversation.
But when you think about like large
endowments, institutional investors,
even mutual funds, like you need a
special wrapper in your mutual fund to
own physical gold.
Like you need to go to the SCC and get
approval.
And so, you know, gold has been sort of
dormant for so long until recently, that
is like, yeah, I don't really want to go
through this trouble.
To buy something that doesn't have a
cash flow, can't be valued, requires
special regulatory approvals, and then
all of a sudden it starts to run like it
is now everybody.
And so, so I think that's the story.
So ironically, because Bitcoin has
obviously come well after gold as a kind
of a store of value, hard money asset.
In a way, gold is kind of like where
Bitcoin was ten years ago or five years
ago where, okay, bitcoin's interesting,
but I don't understand it.
I don't feel like spending 100 hours on
this.
It's a bubble, it's a scam, it's a pet
rock.
And gold is like if it keeps going the
way it is and I suspect it will, like
the endowments are like, okay, like
people are asking me about this.
I need to like, really like figure out
how do we not how do we buy it?
You can buy it, of course, but it's
always been a a dismissed asset, let me
put it that way.
I mean, that's what I grew up with.
It was kind of mocked by the equity
people.
Depends on the length of the chart you
look at.
You could show a trailing multi-decade
period where gold has outperformed the
S&P.
So so if you look at gold as in a
secular bull market, yeah, I'm not
asking for a forecast, but what's within
the range of possible numbers gold could
run to from 3700 up from the low 2000s
and early.
What do we peak in like 2014 and then
2019, something like that.
And it was like 260 that I remember in
the 1980s.
Yeah, Yeah.
When Gold first came out, I want to say
gold was about four 3440.
I remember talking about it on TV and
getting laughed at by figures.
So I once saw a chart that actually Paul
Tudor Jones created, speaking of Fall,
where he compared the the aboveground
value of gold or the value of above
ground gold and compared it to the value
of M2.
And and they're trying to track each
other.
The chart concluded that when the money
supply grows too fast,
gold takes market share.
So hard money takes market share from
soft money from fiat money.
And at certain extremes, like in the
seventies and other periods of thirties
gold, the value of gold would go all the
way up or beyond the value of M2.
And so right now, M2 is about 23
trillion.
Gold plus Bitcoin is is also about 23
trillion.
So in that sense, it's come a long way
to to take that market share.
And now it's a question of does M2
either globally or in the U.S.
continue to grow at an above average
pace?
So the average pace is about 6% nominal,
about 2 to 3% real.
So I do think a lot of the gains are in
already, but it will it will naturally
overshoot as these cycles all.
Always do so.
So that's kind of how I would how I
would measure it.
So if the money supply goes to 30
trillion.
Gold and Bitcoin could be 35 trillion.
And obviously gold is a large part of
that.
Bitcoin's about 2 trillion.
And then you convert that to to a price.
But that's kind of how I think about the
valuation side.
Really fascinating.
So I only have you for a limited amount
of time.
Let me jump to my favorite questions
that I ask all of my guests, starting
with.
Tell us about your mentors who helped
shape your career.
Definitely.
Nat Johnson Mm hmm.
Because when I came in to Fidelity in
95, I had been in the of in New York for
ten years, didn't really have mentors.
And so he.
You know, Fidelity has a very strong
corporate culture, let's put it that
way.
And especially around, you know, the way
we approach long term investments, we're
obviously a long term investor.
But so he he was like the last person I
spoke to before I got hired.
And then in those formative years, I
worked in the chat room and I would
spend hours per week with with Ned.
Like he would just come down really and
hours per week and we would just pour
over charts like we have these huge
charts on the wall, floor to ceiling,
you know, like 40 foot wide, like a
daily chart of, of whatever the Dow and
S&P by him.
It would be computer generated but then
because we don't want to print a whole
new 40 foot sheet every year you would
just you fill it in by hand and and you
know, just the the oral tradition, the
oral history.
So he was looking at the chart and then
he would say, okay, well, like and he
would go from right to left and say,
okay, you know, then and we'd end up
like in 1968.
And he's telling me about the glamour
stocks and this and that.
And I'm like, Wow, this is like gold or
I like you don't, you know, literally.
And so he would have this encyclopedic
memory, but also just the way the
information was displayed.
Sammy Log skills, the chart room has
like museum quality lighting, how you
display, how you visualize, you know,
data.
And so that he instilled that culture,
you know, we call it kaizen, kind of
just gradually improving and having, you
know, compounding isn't just for
investing, right?
It's just in our day to day stuff, you
do something consistently right, It's
going to make an impact.
And when I look back at my 40 years and
I'm not going anywhere, but like to me
that that Kaizen has has really played a
role in my relationships, in my work.
And and I think a lot of that just came
from him.
Really, really interesting.
Let's talk about books.
What are some of your favorites?
What are you reading now?
So I hate to admit it, but
I don't read a lot of finance books
because I'm very interested in having
balanced budget.
I don't want finance between right and
left.
People read reminiscence of a stock
operator.
I'm curious as to what else you read.
Well, I will say that during COVID, I
read a huge tune called The History of
the Federal Reserve by Alan Meltzer.
Oh, sure.
Because, you know, I've looked at so
many charts.
You've read the reports of like the
financial thousand pages, official press
doorstop, But I went like that book.
It was like this blow by blow using the
Fed minutes and all these, you know,
correspondence to see how the Fed
handled the, the financial repression of
the forties.
And so that was fascinating although
most people would say, well, that sounds
really boring.
But but as as a as a consumer of the
data just to hit to see okay you know
like the whoever was at the Fed would go
to the Treasury and they were playing
games like the Treasury would issue
bonds below market and then the auction
would fill.
Then knowing that the Fed would have to
mop up the supply.
Like all of that stuff is just really,
really fascinating.
And, you know, and we see the
interference in politics with politics
and money's monetary policy today, but
it's nothing new.
Like in the sixties, both Nixon and
Kennedy were equally guilty.
It seems a little more overt and more
obvious today.
It used to be sort of a cloak room.
Sort of, Yes.
So so that was one.
But the most interesting recent book
I've read was it's called Rock Me on the
Water,
and it's a book about music, TV and
movies during the early seventies and
how L.A.
was like the epicenter of American
culture.
So you had like the Laurel Canyon folks
and the musicians in Nashville.
David Crosby had these groundbreaking TV
shows, right?
Because we were coming out of the
straitjacket of the Sixties conformist,
like no one dared to make a show that
that, like, challenged the status quo.
And then you had like, MASH and, you
know, Mary Tyler Moore on the Family and
then the movies like Taxi Driver and as
a you know, as a I think I'm kind of Gen
X, but on the border of Gen-X and Baby
Boomer, the same like a foot in each
camp.
Yeah.
And so growing up, you know, formative
years in the seventies in Aruba, but
consuming American pop culture, we would
sit down every night watching like, you
know, Wide World of sports and Mary
Tyler Moore and all those show Rock Me
on the water, rock me on the wall.
That and it's just like so it's
fascinating to read about the things
that we lived through as kids, as
teenagers.
But then like, yeah, you know, that was
so amazing.
Let's talk about streaming.
What are you watching or listening to
right now?
We are binge watching the bear.
So I'm a I'm an avid cook.
Like I said, I run a food camp at
Burning Man.
And that's that's and we tend to be late
to shows and then we just watch like 44
seasons of There Is great.
Yeah.
So we do cook or worked in restaurants.
Yeah, it just rings so true.
Yeah.
I got to ask you a crazy question.
You're a cook.
What parts do you like?
What knives do you like?
I use the all-clad I have.
I have two places.
I have a gas stove in Santa Barbara and
an induction stove in Boston.
You know, I came this close to putting
an induction stove in my primary
residence, but we had just gotten gas,
and so, of course we ran with gas.
Yeah, I will run with gas any time.
Induction is good.
It's very precise.
Yes.
But I like the the organic kind of
tactical, the tactic, tactile dimension
of gas.
But so All-clad and the the German
knives
with Scott Gustaf I forget and my go to
knife is a ten inch chef's knife, not
the really high one, but the medium one.
So the medium one is is thick enough to
like smash on garlic, but not so thick
that you don't feel connected.
You don't have the road feel of the
knife on the cutting boards.
My guilty pleasure on Tik-tok is a
little food clips and I don't even have
to have the sound on.
It's just, you know, because I kind of
know what works with recipes.
So I don't need a recipe, but I just
need someone to visualize an approach.
And so a lot of the things I cook today
are from TikTok.
Oh, no kidding.
Yeah.
Oh, that's amazing.
All right, our final two questions.
What sort of advice would you give a
recent college grad interested in a
career in technical analysis, fixed
income or just investing generally?
Be open minded, be humble.
You know that the true heroes of mine in
our business, including that Johnson is
no longer with us, Of course.
Was that just humility?
Right.
I'll talk to Will Danoff, who runs 300
billion.
I love Will.
He's the humble, this guy, right?
He's amazing.
Ever meet and there's no room for four
big egos.
Like no matter how important you are.
Like, I have no time for that.
Right?
So stay humble.
Don't figure out.
Don't think you you'll figure it all
out.
When at the age of 25, you'll be learner
and be ready to reinvent yourself.
I've had to do it a number of times with
fidelity, either
as planned or as not planned.
And you just got to roll with the
punches.
And like I said, the first job I had, I
was like the last job I was interested
in.
But I took it because it was the only
job, you know.
And our final question, what do you know
about the world of investing today?
You wish you knew 40 years ago or so
when you were first getting started.
The markets go through cycles and it
always comes back, not always quickly,
but, you know, every time the market
goes down 20 plus percent, it's like the
end of the world.
And it's like totally different from
every other time.
And this is like such a crisis.
But then, you know, I've now been
through like 12 bear markets in my
career and it's like, yeah, whatever.
And like, nothing shocks me anymore.
Of course, I may be in a better place
because I've I've earned my, my wealth.
I'm not still building it, but, but it's
just, you know, take, take, take a step
back.
Look at the bigger picture.
Make sure your portfolio is where it
should be in terms of risk and goals.
And don't be your own worst enemy by
selling at the bottom.
You know, call someone like have them
talk you off the ledge first.
You know, you're Ian.
Thank you for being so generous with
your time.
This has been just delightful.
