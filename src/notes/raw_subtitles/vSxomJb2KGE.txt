- So here's the thing to
recognize about your bad habit.
You cannot eradicate your bad habit.
You have to trick your neurology.
(pensive music)
We are living through this huge evolution
in our understanding of habits,
and it's being driven primarily
by understanding the neurology
of where habits come from.
- I thought that drugs were
the source of the problems
that we were seeing in our community.
Turns out not only was I
wrong, society was wrong.
- Basically, we tend to develop addictions
when we have a psychological need.
At those moments, smartphones
tend to be great vehicles
for providing the hits that
you need when you need them.
- I think that there
is this interior sense
when a bad habit strikes
that people know that
they have a bad habit.
It just seems like a lot of people,
even the most successful people,
don't necessarily know where
to start at changing it.
The ability to form habits
is one of the most important
and amazing evolutionary tactics
that the human race has come
up with and all primates
and almost all animals for that matter.
When you form a habit,
you can execute a fairly
complex series of behaviors
without having to think
really, really hard about it.
And what that means
is that it lets us think
about other things.
But the downside of a habit
is that you stop thinking
while you're doing a habit.
So as a result, you become less aware
of the negative consequences
of that behavior.
There is a woman named Wendy Wood
who did a study when she was at Duke,
and what she found was that
about 45% of all the behaviors
that someone did in a day was habit.
It wasn't decision-making.
And this gets to sort of
the way that habits work,
which is that there's this
thing called the habit loop.
There's three parts to it.
There's first a cue, which
is a trigger for behavior,
and then the behavior itself,
which we usually refer to as a routine.
And then there's the reward,
and the reward is actually
why the habit happens
in the first place.
It's how your brain sort of decides,
should I remember this
pattern for the future or not?
And the cue and the reward
become neurologically intertwined
until a sense of craving emerges
that drives your behavior.
If you take this framework
and sort of apply it
and look at the behaviors
that you do, for instance,
backing your car out of a driveway,
or why you suddenly feel hungry
when you see a donut box
on the counter at work,
but you weren't hungry
five minutes earlier,
you can find these cues and rewards
that kind of explain the behaviors.
So it's enormously important.
- Between 1990 and 2000,
that is deemed the decade of the brain.
There was a lot of money
into studying brain
illnesses, brain disease.
There was a lot of money
in terms of learning about the brain.
And during that time,
we're looking for some neural
footprint of addiction.
And we thought that
once cocaine interacted
with these dopamine neurons,
it just had this almost magical power
over the person's behavior.
We've learned that that's
not necessarily the case.
So when we think of drug addiction,
it's important for the lay audience
to keep the focus on
the person's behavior.
Are they not showing up for work?
Are they not meeting
their obligations at home?
Are they not meeting their
obligations in school?
All of these are important indicators
of whether someone is
drug addicted or not.
And notice, I didn't
look at anyone's brain.
I'm really looking at
the person's behavior.
(cellphone ringing and buzzing)
- Behavioral addiction is a
lot like substance addiction
in a lot of ways.
Basically what has to happen
is that there's a behavior
that you enjoy doing in the short term
that you do compulsively,
so you keep returning to
it over and over again,
but that in the long
term harms your wellbeing
and it can harm your wellbeing
in lots of different respects.
And it's much newer. It's a
much more recent phenomenon.
And I think the reason why
we've got these new forms of addiction,
there are two main reasons.
The first one is that technology
is much more sophisticated
and advanced than it
was even 20 years ago.
You're able to deliver the
kinds of rewards that you need
for a system to be addictive.
So basically what people are
looking for is unpredictability
and the rapid feedback of either rewards
or if it's negative then
negative experiences.
And you actually need that mix
of positive and negative feedback.
Just as, for example, when
you post something online,
sometimes you're gonna get a lot of hits,
sometimes you aren't
and it's that unpredictability
that we find so compelling.
Whenever we're bored,
whenever we're feeling
a little bit lonely,
whenever we're not really sure
what to do with ourselves next,
whenever we don't feel
particularly efficacious,
like we're having an effect on the world
that we'd like to be having,
those are the moments when you're looking
for what some people
call the adult pacifier.
And smartphones tend to
be a great adult pacifier
because at those moments,
you turn on your screen,
you swipe and you feel relaxed again.
- If you just try and say,
"I'm gonna use willpower
to make this behavior go
away," it's not gonna work.
And we know this from study after study.
Every scientist who's worked
on habits will tell you,
once a neurology of that habit is set,
it's always there in some form or another.
So what you need to do
is instead of thinking about
eradicating this bad habit
or just using willpower
to sort of blast your
way through, ignoring it,
is to change it.
And there's this thing that's known
as the golden rule of habit change,
which is if a habit is made up of a cue,
a routine, and a reward,
you can't change all three parts at once.
In fact, you shouldn't even try.
What you really wanna change
is you wanna change the
routine, the behavior.
And to do that, you need
to keep the same cue
and deliver the same reward,
and you'll be able to
shoehorn that new behavior
into your daily pattern.
You can't change everything overnight.
You can't suddenly say, I want
a brand new habit tomorrow,
and expect it to be easy and effortless.
It's something you have to
give yourself permission
to take a little bit of time to practice
because you're building up neural pathways
associated with a certain behavior,
and those neural pathways
just build up over time.
You can't speed up that process
any more than is natural.
