(brooding music)
- Most plane doors aren't locked.
There are no keys, no sensors
or passcodes to secure them.
If someone wants to pull
the lever, they can.
- A man opened the emergency exit door
and forced his way off the plane.
- And yet with 40 million
flights each year,
these doors are virtually
never opened in flight.
So, why not?
- Your self preservation, surely.
- Common sense.
- Most people are, you know, smart enough
to not mess with that.
- The real answer relies
on where planes fly.
- How high do planes fly approximately?
- 10,000 km or
is that overshooting it?
- I think that's overshooting it.
I think you'd be in space.
- 25,000 km.
That's the height of a plane flying?
- Is that way too low?
- It's too much. It's too much.
Too much. Too much.
Bring it down.
- Maybe yeah, 1,000 km?
- 1,000 km, still space.
- 50,000 ft, I think.
- Yeah, some of them can
go up to 43,000 ft.
- 30,000 ft.
- 38,000 ft.
- Yeah.
Why do they fly that high?
Uhh...
- I don't know. Safety, I guess.
- Probably to avoid
collision with other aircraft
and if there's high mountain ranges.
- I don't know,
when storms or weather hit?
- My guess is to avoid
the turbulent weather.
- I think that's a decent guess.
Now, it's true that one of the benefits
of flying at 30,000 ft is a smoother ride.
This is high in the troposphere,
the layer in which most weather occurs.
So, there's less turbulence
and fewer storms to navigate around.
But this is not the main
reason that planes fly so high.
The bigger reason, of course, is money.
As you go up, the density of air decreases
and at 33,000 ft or 10 km,
the density of air is just a third
of what it is at sea level.
So flying at this altitude,
the plane runs into a third
of the air molecules it would
closer to the ground.
That means the plane
can fly about 73% faster
for the same amount of thrust.
And as a result, you get
to your destination faster
and since you spend less time in the air,
you burn less fuel.
It seems in a way that like
climbing is wasted energy.
Can you compare like the
descent to the ascent?
Do you essentially get the energy back
as you fall down the other side?
- Yeah.
When we climb, we burn
about 80 kilos per minute.
In cruise, we burn about
40 kilos per minute.
And in descent, it's maybe 10.
So, it's almost negligible.
- Not only that, jet engines
are more efficient at altitude.
They work by compressing
air at the intake,
mixing it with fuel and igniting it.
So, the combustion products
are ejected very fast
from the exhaust nozzle.
Now, this process is more
efficient the colder the air is.
And at altitude, the temperature
is around minus 50 degrees Celsius,
which is a lot colder
than an average of plus 15
here at the ground.
So, flying higher means you
burn less fuel for less time
and avoid the weather
and associated turbulence
of lower altitudes.
- The other reason you wanna fly high
is to take advantage of
the jet stream tailwinds
and the company likes people who do that,
because you're burning less fuel,
so it's less money.
- But there is a problem
with flying this high.
The air up there is unbreathable.
If you were suddenly teleported
to the top of Mount Everest, a
height lower than planes fly,
you would remain conscious
for only about three minutes.
This is because in addition
to density dropping with
altitude, so does air pressure.
Air pressure actually falls off faster,
because it depends on the
weight of all the air above you.
So at 10 km, the air pressure
is only a quarter of
what it is at sea level.
To be clear, the air is still 21% oxygen,
but the partial pressure of oxygen,
the pressure exerted
solely by oxygen molecules
is around 5.5 kilopascals,
which is a quarter of
what it is on the ground.
Now at this pressure, not
enough oxygen molecules
can force their way into
your blood in your lungs.
To function normally, humans
need an oxygen partial pressure
of at least 16 kilopascals.
So, all the cabins of airplanes
that cruise at high altitude
must be pressurized.
A little bit of air is
continuously brought
into the cabin from outside.
It actually comes in from
the compression stage
of the jet engines.
That is what maintains
breathable air inside the plane.
- The downside is that you are taking away
a little bit of the
efficiency of the engines.
- Now, pressurizing the cabin
required a radical redesign of aircraft.
Before pressurization, planes would fly
up to 10,000 feet or
around three kilometers,
where the partial pressure
of oxygen is 15 kilopascals,
just at the limit of
what people can handle.
On these planes, doors opened outward
and there wasn't much concern
about the seal around them
since the pressure was
the same on both sides.
But once planes were pressurized,
all the doors were changed
to be the shape of a plug.
They're wider on the
inside than the outside.
That way the higher
pressure inside the cabin
pushes the door into its frame,
creating an airtight seal.
How airtight is a cabin?
- It's pretty airtight, but
not completely airtight.
So,  you'll notice for example,
every time that someone
flushes the toilet,
you'll see some of the
air pressure go down.
So every time that happens,
you can actually see the cabin
altitude jump a little bit.
- And this is why plane doors
and emergency exit doors
don't need locks.
The difference in pressure
between the pressurized cabin
and the low pressure exterior is so great
that no one is strong enough
to pull the door inwards.
And if someone had come up
and turned that while
you're mid-flight? 
Nothing.
- Even modern plane
doors that open outward
are shaped like plugs.
They're just cleverly designed.
The main passenger door on a Boeing 737
is both wider and taller
than the frame it needs
to pass through.
But when you pull the lever,
gates at the top and bottom fold in,
reducing the height just enough.
However, the sides are still too wide.
So, the door first has
to pop inside and rotate.
It's that movement inwards
that is impossible at altitude.
It would require a force equivalent
to lifting 9,000 kilograms.
And airplane cabins aren't
even fully pressurized
to the sea level pressure
of 101.3 kilopascals.
You may have noticed this
if you take a bag of chips on a plane.
It's easy to squish on the ground
but as the plane climbs, the
pressure in the cabin drops
and the chip bag seems to
inflate like a balloon.
I measured the pressure in my plane
and at cruising altitude,
the pressure dropped to 77 kilopascals.
Meaning the partial pressure of oxygen 
was only 16 kilopascals,
the minimum required for people
on the plane to feel normal.
This has some unintended consequences.
Do you think you fart more in a plane?
(interviewee laughing)
- If I did, I'd blame someone else.
- I feel like no.
- No.
- No
- I can't let it rip, no way in the world.
Do you think you fart more in
a plane than on the ground?
- A hundred percent, no hesitation.
Sure, I mean it's gotta do
with the cabin pressure, right?
- So as you go up, that
cavity in here now expands
and the air wants to go somewhere,
and the quickest place it can go is south.
- Bag of chips just popped by itself.
- Now, the International
Space Station is pressurized
to sea level pressure, 101.3 kilopascals.
So, why are planes pressurized
to the minimum extent possible
to carry human passengers?
Well, it's actually
for a very good reason.
In 1988, Aloha Airlines 243
was en route from Hilo
to Honolulu, Hawaii.
The cabin was being
pressurized as we've described,
but unfortunately, this plane's
fuselage had a small crack
and all of a sudden at 24,000 feet,
the crack widened and the whole roof
tore off the front of the plane.
Miraculously the pilots
were able to land safely
and only one person was killed.
The difference between the
International Space Station
and a plane is that the
ISS was pressurized once
and it stays pressurized.
But a plane experiences
a pressure difference
every time it climbs to cruising altitude.
So, the fuselage is stretched
and then relaxed with every flight.
Stretched and relaxed,
stretched and relaxed.
The Aloha Airlines plane
had the second highest 737
flight cycle count in the world,
with nearly 90,000 in total.
That's way more than it was designed for.
This led to fatigue, cracking, corrosion,
and the eventual explosive decompression.
So, planes are pressurized
to the least extent possible
to minimize stresses and
extend the life of the plane.
But even 75% of atmospheric pressure
should be plenty to prevent
the doors from opening.
So, how did this happen in May, 2023?
- A passenger panicked
and actually managed
to open an Airbus
emergency exit in flight.
They were on final approach
and they were quite close to the ground,
so the pressure differential
was very little.
And because of him using all of his force,
he actually managed to get
the door open, which was crazy
and we didn't think
that that was possible.
But if you want something
bad enough, I guess it is.
- Wow.
Was he okay?
- He was okay. Everyone
was okay in that case.
- That was a pretty serious mishap.
So, I guess the next logical question is: 
Have any other passengers
inadvertently caused a mishap, 
by say, forgetting to put
their phone on airplane mode?
When you're sitting there on the tarmac
and they come on and tell you
to put your phone on
airplane mode, do you do it?
And why do they get us to do that?
What is the reason? Is there a reason?
- Obviously, they
wouldn't ask you to do it
if it wasn't for some benefit.
- I'm unfortunately a bit of a rebel
and I don't follow the rules and yeah.
- But you're not worried
about taking the plane down?
- I'd make sure my parents
have the airplane mode on
so I can have it off.
- I mean, yes I do because
I don't want it interfering
with like the radio or whatever.
- Well, I think it's the
communication interference.
- I feel like I've always been told
like it messes up like instruments,
but honestly you're
always just told to do it.
So you know, just gotta put
your phone in  airplane mode.
- In 1961, the Federal
Aviation Administration or FAA
found that some portable FM radios
could interfere with
plane navigation systems
since they used neighboring radio bands.
And out of caution, they banned
almost all personal
electronics on flights.
But airlines could test
any device for interference
and overrule the FAA ban
to allow it on board.
Any device, that is, except a phone,
because another organization
has jurisdiction over phones
and that's the Federal
Communications Commission, or FCC.
See a phone on the ground
with buildings and hills around it
can usually only see
one or two cell towers
at the same time.
But from the air, it could
see 10 or 20 or more.
The concern was that 200 phones
traveling at 800 kilometers
per hour in a plane
could rapidly connect
to many towers at once,
overloading the infrastructure.
At least that's what the
FCC thought could happen.
So, they banned cell phone
use in flight in 1991.
(funky music)
But there's a problem with this theory.
A plane is a big metal enclosure,
essentially a Faraday cage.
So, it should block almost
all electromagnetic signals.
That's why plane antennas
are located on the outside.
Your phone signals can only
escape through the windows,
which means they go horizontally
out the sides of the plane.
So, they would have to
travel long distances
before reaching the ground.
And the cell towers your
phone is trying to connect to,
well they are tilted downwards, you know,
to collect all the signals from people
walking around on the ground.
So, it's very hard to make
a connection from the air
unless you're flying really low.
So, phones could only conceivably
disrupt ground networks
during takeoff or landing.
And the FCC never even
tested if this was the case.
In 2005, they went
before Congress and said
the rule banning 800 MHz
cell phone use in flight
may not be needed in order
to protect ground-based cellular networks.
As far as we know,
a mobile phone has never
caused an air accident.
All airplane mode does for
sure is save your battery life.
So, why are these rules still around?
- I've been flying myself
and where I've gotten interference,
you know, when you're
talking to a traffic control
and you get that
(imitating a phone signal),
you know that signal,
and that is because someone
is either using their phone
or the phone is on.
Will one phone in an
aircraft cause any problems?
Probably not.
Will 200 do something?
Maybe.
Rather than taking the
chance of like, let's everyone
update their Twitter profile at 500 feet,
rather than saying that, we're saying no,
you know, just keep them off, you know,
enjoy the Wi-Fi up at
altitude and that's it.
- But airplane mode might
soon be a thing of the past.
The EU actually no longer requires it
and is pushing for airlines
to provide 5G service
on all EU flights.
So, we may eliminate that inconvenience,
but we still have to
deal with airplane food.
What do you think about airplane food?
- I only eat the bread rolls.
That's only thing I can handle.
Apart from that, everything
tastes like mush.
- It's can be very good.
It can be very terrible.
- Eh, bland-ish, different consistency.
- Do you think the food
tastes as good in a plane
as it would on the ground?
- No.
- But bad-tasting food might
not be all the airlines' fault.
See, the air that's pumped
into the cabin altitude
is really dry.
And the Sahara Desert for reference
has an average relative humidity of 25%,
but inside an airplane cabin,
it can be as low as 5%.
This can dry out your nasal passages,
hindering your sense of
smell and therefore taste.
The lower cabin pressure
can also decrease sensations
like the intensity of salt and sugar.
But there is one flavor
that appears to be enhanced
in flight.
What do you drink in an airplane?
What's your drink of choice?
- Apple juice.
- Apple juice?
- Yeah.
- Interesting.
- I mean Coke, that's default
- Orange or apple juice.
- Gin and tonic.
- Maybe a Bloody Mary, but...
- You're the first one today.
- Really?
- Yeah.
A German survey of a thousand flyers
found that more than a quarter of them
order tomato juice in flight.
And what's really weird is
that 23% of those people
would never drink it on the ground.
And would you drink Bloody Mary,
would that be like a
standard drink at the bar
or is it a special plane drink?
- I only have it on planes.
- So, why is everyone
ordering tomato juice?
Well, it could be because of the noise.
A 2015 study points to the chorda tympani,
a nerve that carries taste information
from the tongue to the brainstem.
It runs right past the eardrum,
between the tiny sound conducting bones.
So, loud cabin noise might
unintentionally stimulate it.
This could produce an audio illusion
that boosts our sense of umami,
the savory taste you
find in MSG, soy sauce,
and well, tomatoes.
- I always drink tomato
juice and I never knew why.
It just felt like my plane drink.
Or like spicy tomato juice-
- Yeah.
- Like both of those
are favorites of mine.
- Yeah.
So, next time you're on a flight,
go for something extra sweet or salty
or maybe try the tomato juice.
I feel like with how much people fly,
our perspective of flying
is still pretty distorted.
So, why is that?
- Yeah.
I know that we talk a lot
about accidents and incidents
and we dig into them really, really deep
and people might ask, "Why
would you be doing this?
Doesn't that just make people
even more afraid of flying?"
But the fact is that this
is one of the prime reasons
why aviation is as safe as it is.
The fact that we have
hundreds of professionals
that dig deep into these accidents
means that we learn from them.
So, every flight becomes
a little bit safer.
That's actually a big reason
that I started my channel
Mentour Pilot in the first place
'cause I promise you, the more you know
the safer you'll feel.
(closing music)
- Do you think that climate
change increases turbulence?
- Eh, depends on what people
think about their opinions.
- Yeah.
- It's been a bit of that in
news recently, hasn't there?
- Today, the media tends to prioritize
sensationalized headlines
over key details.
Part of why airplane mode is
still such a big deal today
is because of the media frenzy
it started in the 1960s.
So it's more important than ever
to look at all sides of the story.
This is why we specifically
asked Ground News
to sponsor this video.
Recent stories about the
increase in turbulence
come from a 2023 study
that suggested a link to climate change.
Yet, this study was barely
reported on by the media,
totally eclipsed by other major events.
But Ground News lets you
see the whole picture.
You can easily compare the coverage
and verify the source of the information.
If you look closer,
you'll see that some of the outlets,
like The Independent and the SCMP,
argue that climate change is
making flying more dangerous.
While others like the Free
Press paint a different picture
by dismissing the study.
That's why it's really important
to look at all the information.
But Ground News doesn't
only highlight breaking news
on things like science and aviation,
they also specifically
show blind spot stories
the media isn't covering.
Veritasium is all about
getting to the truth
and Ground News' mission
is to provide all sides of every story,
so that we can do that for ourselves.
