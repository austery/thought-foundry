From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Wednesday,
 October
 15th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.

 anything.
 He's
 not
 doing

 need
 to
 stay
 over

 Chicago
 and
 the
 surrounding
 suburbs.


>> He's

>> He's
 a
 citizen.
 A
 crackdown
 by
 federal


immigration
 agents
 has
 been


intensifying.


What
 started
 with
 a
 slow
 uptick
 in


arrests
 has
 escalated
 rapidly
 with


agents
 sometimes
 in
 masks
 pulling
 up
 to


people
 on
 sidewalks
 and
 detaining
 them.


And
 the
 encounters
 are
 increasingly


turning
 into
 open
 confrontations.
 I've


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 aggressive
 tactics


from
 federal
 agents
 who
 have
 fired
 tear


gas
 and
 pepper
 balls
 at
 not
 just


protesters,
 but
 at
 people
 on
 city


streets
 who
 have
 formed
 crowds
 when
 they


see
 people
 being
 arrested.
 Julie
 Bosman


is
 the
 Chicago
 bureau
 chief
 for
 the


Times.
 She
 says
 just
 yesterday,
 ICE


agents
 used
 tear
 gas
 on
 a
 crowd,


apparently
 without
 warning.
 The
 scene


was
 so
 chaotic
 that
 even
 police
 officers


nearby
 were
 exposed
 with
 one
 officer


seen
 rinsing
 out
 his
 eyes
 with
 a
 garden


hose.
 In
 response
 to
 these
 aggressive


tactics
 from
 federal
 agents,
 I
 think


that
 regular
 Chicagoans
 are
 really


pushing
 back.
 They
 crowd
 around
 when


agents
 are
 making
 arrests.
 They
 organize


on
 Facebook.


They
 try
 to
 warn
 other
 people.
 I've


heard
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,
 honking
 horns


when
 agents
 are
 spotted
 on
 the
 street,


people
 blowing
 whistles
 when
 they
 see


immigration
 agents.
 So,
 things
 just
 feel


very
 tense
 and
 getting
 more
 tense
 here


in
 Chicago.
 Julie
 says
 that
 the


residents
 who
 have
 been
 pushing
 back
 and


even
 organizing
 patrols
 of
 their
 own
 say


they're
 trying
 to
 protect
 their


neighbors
 and
 that
 they
 feel
 the
 city


didn't
 need
 a
 surge
 of
 federal
 law


enforcement.
 One
 city
 council
 member


said
 quote
 Chicagoans
 are
 just
 trying
 to


live
 their
 life.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


tolerate
 unconstitutional


authoritarianism.


Federal
 authorities
 originally
 told


local
 officials
 that
 they
 expected
 the


operation
 in
 Chicago
 to
 last
 for
 45
 days


as
 they
 said
 they
 needed
 to
 find
 and


arrest
 undocumented
 immigrants.
 There


now
 appears
 to
 be
 no
 set
 end
 date.
 In


the
 past
 few
 weeks,
 the
 Trump


administration
 also
 deployed
 hundreds
 of


National
 Guard
 troops
 to
 the
 Chicago


area,
 saying
 they
 were
 needed
 to
 protect


federal
 agents.
 The
 effort
 was
 recently


blocked
 temporarily
 by
 a
 federal
 judge


who
 accused
 the
 Trump
 administration
 of


misrepresenting
 the
 facts
 on
 the
 ground


to
 justify
 the
 deployment.

Now,
 three
 other
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


Trump
 administration.
 Democrats
 in


Congress
 refuse
 to
 fund
 the
 federal


government.
 And
 because
 of
 this,
 many
 of


our
 operations
 are
 impacted
 and
 most
 of


our
 TSA
 employees
 are
 working
 without


pay.
 As
 the
 government
 shutdown
 hits
 the


2e
 mark,
 the
 president
 and
 his
 team
 are


turning
 up
 the
 political
 pressure
 on


Democrats.
 Christy
 Gnome,
 the
 Secretary


of
 Homeland
 Security,
 recently
 asked


airports
 across
 the
 country
 to
 play
 a


video
 on
 TV
 screens
 near
 security


checkpoints
 that
 blames
 the
 shutdown
 on


Democrats.
 A
 number
 of
 airports,


however,
 have
 refused
 to
 show
 the
 video,


saying
 it's
 overly
 partisan
 and


potentially
 even
 a
 violation
 of
 the


Hatch
 Act,
 a
 law
 intended
 to
 limit


political
 activities
 by
 federal


employees.
 Meanwhile,


>> honestly,
 can
 I
 put
 it
 in
 plain
 words


for
 you?
 Trump
 is
 ramping
 up
 his
 efforts


to
 fire
 federal
 workers
 and
 slash


government
 programs,
 claiming
 the


shutdown's
 given
 him
 a
 quote


unprecedented
 opportunity
 for
 that.


>> So,
 we
 are
 closing
 up
 Democrat
 programs


that
 we
 think
 that
 we
 disagree
 with
 and


they're
 never
 going
 to
 open
 again.


>> In
 the
 past
 2
 weeks,
 the
 administration


has
 frozen
 or
 canled
 nearly
 28
 billion


for
 more
 than
 200
 projects
 primarily
 in


Democratic
 cities
 and
 states.
 everything


from
 subway
 upgrades
 in
 New
 York
 to


renewable
 energy
 projects
 in
 California


and
 Washington
 state.
 At
 the
 same
 time,


the
 White
 House
 has
 used
 creative


accounting
 to
 keep
 funding
 flowing
 to


politically
 sensitive
 areas
 that
 could


have
 otherwise
 triggered
 blowback
 like


military
 salaries
 and
 food
 assistance


for
 low-income
 families.


Also,


>> he's
 MAGA
 all
 the
 way.
 Make
 Argentina


great
 again.
 I
 heard


>> Trump
 hosted
 the
 president
 of
 Argentina,


Javier
 Malay,
 yesterday
 as
 the


administration
 says
 it's
 moving
 forward


with
 a
 controversial
 $20
 billion
 bailout


of
 the
 country
 which
 has
 been
 in


financial
 crisis.
 Trump
 has
 described


Malay
 as
 his
 favorite
 president,
 saying,


"I
 love
 him
 because
 he
 loves
 Trump."
 The


White
 House
 has
 said
 the
 bailout
 is


needed
 to
 stabilize
 Argentina's
 economy,


though
 Trump
 also
 said
 the
 money
 was


contingent
 on
 Malay's
 party
 winning


upcoming
 elections.
 Critics
 of
 the
 plan,


however,
 including
 many
 Democratic


lawmakers,
 say
 the
 financial
 lifeline
 is


effectively
 a
 gift
 to
 hedge
 funds
 and


wealthy
 Americans
 who've
 invested


heavily
 in
 Argentina,
 including
 friends


of
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Bessant.


And
 last
 update


>> today,
 we're
 here
 to
 honor
 and
 remember


a
 fearless
 warrior
 for
 liberty,
 beloved


leader
 who
 galvanized


the
 next
 generation
 like
 nobody
 I've


ever
 seen
 before.


>> In
 the
 Rose
 Garden
 yesterday,
 Trump


postumously
 awarded
 the
 Presidential


Medal
 of
 Freedom
 to
 Charlie
 Kirk,
 the


conservative
 activist
 who
 was


assassinated
 last
 month.
 Trump
 called


Kirk,
 the
 founder
 of
 the
 right-wing


political
 group
 Turning
 Point
 USA,
 a


martyr
 for
 truth
 and
 for
 freedom.
 Trump


and
 other
 Republicans
 have
 credited
 Kirk


with
 helping
 them
 win
 office
 by


mobilizing
 young
 voters.
 The
 president


has
 said
 he
 also
 plans
 to
 award
 the


Medal
 of
 Freedom
 to
 Ben
 Carson,
 the


former
 housing
 secretary,
 and
 Rudy


Giuliani.

A
 new
 report
 has
 found
 that
 a
 lot
 of


popular
 protein
 supplements,
 think
 of


the
 powders
 and
 drinks
 that
 have
 popped


up
 everywhere
 these
 days,
 contain
 levels


of
 lead
 that
 could
 pose
 health
 concerns.


Consumer
 Reports
 tested
 23
 different


products
 and
 found
 that
 over
 2/3
 of
 them


had
 more
 lead
 per
 serving
 than
 the


standard
 set
 by
 the
 state
 of
 California,


which
 has
 a
 strict
 guideline
 on
 lead


consumption.
 At
 least
 a
 few
 products
 had


more
 than
 10
 times
 that
 amount.


According
 to
 the
 report,
 there's
 no


reason
 to
 panic.
 There's
 no
 risk
 of


immediate
 harm
 from
 the
 products,
 but


extended
 use
 may
 be
 unsafe.
 Lead
 is


highly
 toxic
 and
 can
 accumulate
 in
 the


body
 over
 time.
 Children
 are
 at


especially
 high
 risk
 for
 developing


developmental
 delays
 or
 even
 seizures


from
 lead
 exposure.
 Health
 experts
 not


involved
 with
 the
 testing
 called
 the


results
 troubling.
 One
 said
 he
 was
 quote


appalled
 that
 companies
 weren't
 checking


their
 supply
 chains
 well
 enough
 to
 avoid


these
 levels
 of
 lead
 contamination.
 In


the
 US,
 supplements
 like
 protein
 powder


are
 not
 regulated
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that


food
 and
 drugs
 are.
 With
 that
 light


oversight
 in
 mind,
 one
 doctor
 told
 the


Times
 consumers
 should
 weigh
 whether
 the


risk
 of
 supplements
 is
 worth
 it
 since


there
 are
 other
 ways
 to
 get
 protein.

And
 finally,


>> it's
 a
 major
 problem.
 Criminals
 riding


up
 on
 ebikes
 and
 literally
 nicking


devices
 out
 of
 people's
 hands.


>> I've
 just
 put
 my
 phone
 against
 my
 chest.


I'm
 thinking,
 "No,
 not
 me.
 not
 at
 9:00


a.m.
 Like
 I'm
 just


>> In
 recent
 years,
 London
 has
 earned
 a


reputation
 as
 one
 of
 the
 phone
 theft


capitals
 of
 the
 world.


>> A
 mobile
 phone
 is
 snatched
 every
 15


minutes
 in
 this
 part
 of
 London
 alone.


>> Social
 media
 is
 flooded
 with
 warnings


about
 staying
 alert.


>> Guys,
 my
 phone
 nearly
 got
 stolen
 today.


No,
 it's
 actually
 not
 funny.


>> Along
 with
 surveillance
 footage
 of
 theft


after
 theft
 on
 busy
 streets
 in
 broad


daylight,
 the
 culprits
 zipping
 away.


Some
 experts
 say
 part
 of
 what's
 made
 it


so
 common
 in
 Britain
 is
 the
 fact
 that


police
 budgets
 were
 slashed
 in
 the
 last


decade
 to
 the
 point
 that
 police
 in


London
 said
 they
 would
 stop


investigating
 minor
 crimes
 when
 there


was
 a
 low
 chance
 of
 catching
 anyone.
 Now


though,
 after
 80,000
 phones
 were
 stolen


in
 the
 last
 year
 alone,
 police
 in
 London


are
 trying
 to
 tackle
 the
 problem.
 And


some
 of
 what
 they've
 uncovered
 points
 to


an
 industrial
 level
 criminal
 operation.


They
 say
 there's
 three
 tiers
 to
 it.
 The


thieves
 at
 the
 bottom
 wearing
 balaclavas


on
 ebikes.
 They
 then
 sell
 the
 stolen


phones
 to
 shopkeepers
 and
 other


middlemen.
 And
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 network


are
 exporters.
 Police
 say
 they
 found


that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stolen
 phones
 are


being
 shipped
 overseas
 and
 have


identified
 a
 group
 they
 say
 was


responsible
 for
 sending
 almost
 40,000


phones
 to
 China
 where
 they
 can
 be
 resold


for
 a
 large
 profit.
 When
 police
 arrested


two
 men
 who
 they
 say
 were
 ring
 leaders


for
 sending
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 phones


overseas,
 they
 found
 several
 phones
 in


their
 car
 wrapped
 in
 foil,
 an
 attempt
 to


try
 and
 block
 the
 signals
 from
 people


trying
 to
 use
 the
 find
 my
 iPhone
 feature


before
 the
 thieves
 could
 get
 them
 out
 of


the
 country.
 Police
 later
 said
 that
 the


men
 had
 gone
 to
 Costco
 at
 one
 point
 and


bought
 over
 a
 mile
 and
 a
 half
 of


tinfoil.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines
 today
 on
 the


daily.
 President
 Trump's
 border,
 Tom
 H.


Home. Homeman,
 was
 recorded
 on
 camera


last
 year,
 accepting
 $50,000
 in
 cash
 in


an
 undercover
 FBI
 investigation,


according
 to
 people
 familiar
 with
 the


case.
 The
 investigation
 was
 then
 closed


under
 Trump,
 and
 administration


officials
 have
 been
 sidestepping


questions
 about
 it.
 My
 colleague
 Devon


Barrett
 walks
 through
 what
 happened.
 You


can
 listen
 to
 that
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times


app
 or
 wherever
 you
 get
 your
 podcasts.
