- Let's have faith
in the pace of progress of the technology,
because if the models get good
enough to do it end to end,
a year from now and only
then you start deploying it.
There will be
another two year delay
and that's, you know, that's two years
during which all the
work that you're doing
to benefit patients is not happening.
Hello everyone.
My name is Diogo Rau
and I'm Chief Information
and Digital Officer
of Eli Lilly and Company.
I'm joined here with Dario,
who is the Founder and CEO of Anthropic.
Dario, thanks for joining me today.
- Thanks for having me, Diogo.
- I know
you're spending a lot of
time now thinking about
how do you work better with enterprises?
What's your enterprise strategy
and how do you see Anthropic
different from other providers?
- Yeah, I mean, you know,
I think we've made a number
of choices that are different, right?
So if I think about the
incentives given by consumer AI,
their folks are in a competition
for engagement and growth, right?
And so that drives a lot
of behaviors of the AI
that I think are not ideal
from an enterprise perspective,
For example, there's this
idea of model sycophancy
where the model tells you whatever you say
is a good idea,
- Right.
right, and even on the
consumer side that can,
you know, cause problems.
We've seen stories of people
who are like, oh yeah,
I've discovered a new
fundamental theory of physics.
- And that's right.
- Models, like, that's great
and maybe you don't want it to,
maybe you don't want it to say that,
but I think, you know, of
course on the enterprise side,
you know, the problems are
much greater and clearer
with that, where, you know,
you really don't want the model to say,
oh yeah, this drug compound's great.
Spend millions of dollars to, you know,
I just think this is, you know,
I think your idea is great.
I think it's really promising,
like, you want truth.
- Yeah.
- And so I think that incentive has led us
to design our models in
a different way, right?
I think it's more compatible
with making the model smarter,
making them better at a wide variety
of economically valuable tasks.
And it causes us
to put a premium on
accuracy and reliability.
One experiment, you know,
that I give to everyone,
although it's particularly relevant
because I'm talking to
you, is I say, you know,
let's say I improve the model's
knowledge of biochemistry
from undergraduate level knowledge
to graduate level knowledge.
You know, if I go to consumers
and say that, 99% of them
are going to say, you know,
I didn't know what you
were talking about before.
I don't know what you're
talking about now,
but if I go to you, like you really,
you care about that, a lot.
- Appreciate that.
- Like, that's very important.
- That's exactly right.
Well, actually, that
gets into something else
that you've launched as
well, which is Skills, right?
There are a lot of skills
that you want in biology
or even just skills,
like, as an enterprise,
how you want to operate.
Is that part of the
future for you as well?
- Yeah, I definitely think so.
I mean, things ranging
from skills to, you know,
we're in the process of launching
various specialized Claudes
which are, you know, in some cases
will be improvements to the model itself,
fine tunings of the model.
But in some cases it'll be something
that looks more like wrapping
the model with access
to particular types of information.
So when we did Claude
for Financial Services,
you know, we connected to
a lot of the usual kind
of indices and ratings.
And so, you know, you'd be surprised
to connect Claude to those things
and kind of use it in a way
that's aware of that
knowledge is valuable.
So I think, you know,
we're working on a Claude
for Life Sciences that
will be some mixture
of making the model inherently smarter
and wrapping it with
various things, right?
I don't know exactly what
the analogy will be here,
but like, geez, there are
zillions of databases of,
you know, proteins, compounds,
assays, like, you know,
you probably want that at
the model's fingertips.
- Well, any parting advice for those of us
that are working in this world
of drug discovery and development?
- You know, I would say
there's a temptation
and it's, I think it's hard
to avoid starting this way
of, you know, what are the
small things we can do with AI?
Like, and in a way you just
kind of have to start there.
I think one of my pieces
of advice is be very,
very ambitious in terms of
where the models are going.
I think you can get caught in a mode
where there's an existing process,
it has 20 parts you want to swap in AI,
to part five and part 12.
And, you know, that can actually be hard
because part 12 has to, you
know, intersect with part 13
and part 11, which are
not being done with AI.
And you know, you look at it
and you're like, well,
the AI models aren't
where they could do, you know, part zero
to part 20, end to end,
But in a year they might be.
- That's right.
- And so,
you should start thinking now,
don't get too seduced by, oh,
we can make these little
hill climbing gains
by, you know, doing
this part and that part,
let's start preparing to do
the whole thing end to end.
Let's have faith in the pace
of progress of the technology.
Because if the models get good
enough to do it end to end,
a year from now and only
then you start deploying it,
there will be another two year,
- That's right.
- There'll be
another two year delay.
And that's, you know, that's two years
during which all the
work that you're doing
to benefit patients is not happening.
Whereas if you go in parallel,
if you start preparing
now for the large change
as the models are getting better,
then you know, you may save years of time.
- That's right.
So don't do two year long projects
and expect that it's gonna
be exactly the same way
in two years from now as this,
- Yes, if you do two year long projects,
plan for where the AI is gonna, I mean,
that sounds like an obvious thing to say,
but I think it actually takes
a lot of courage and foresight to do that.
- It does. For sure.
Well, thanks a lot for taking
the time to chat today.
Really appreciate it.
- Yeah, yeah. Thank you.
