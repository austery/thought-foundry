- In this US Government lab,
they study air flow to solve crimes,
using mirrors, lights and lasers,
they can illuminate
the tiniest differences
in air temperature and density,
and track how drug powder
settles in the rooms of a house,
determine which person fired a gun,
or spot particles escaping
from a sealed package.
A portion of this video was
sponsored by Caseta by Lutron.
Our best tool for picking
up trace substances
has been the same for centuries.
- So it turns out nature
has already provided us
with the best chemical detector,
and that is the dog's nose.
So this is Bubbles.
She's a 3D-printed,
anatomically-correct model
of a female Labrador Retriever.
We tried to get one of the
police canines to come in here
and get in front of the mirror,
but dogs get hungry and
cranky very quickly.
And we got about four
seconds of good footage,
and I'm like, okay, we
can do better than this.
- Dogs can sniff very faint scents
and from far away,
but they don't do it just by breathing in.
What they do is breathe out and in rapidly
around five times a second.
(air whizzing)
- What I want you to notice
is this pulsating motion
by the, we'll call it
the doggy treat, right?
This is our doggy treat.
If you notice this pulsating motion.
- And what allows them to
detect scents from far away
is the rapid and turbulent exhale.
- When the dog exhales,
there's a turbulent air jet
that comes out of each nostril,
just like when you and I exhale.
If you put your hand under here
and just exhale outta your nose,
those are two turbulent air jets coming
out of the dog's nose.
But when the dog is down on the ground,
those air jets are vectored
back towards its rear.
The dog is pushing air back,
and when by doing that, it's
pulling air from ahead of it.
So imagine me, I'm blowing air this way,
and when I do that,
I actually reach out
and pull air towards me.
The dog reverses flow inhales, right?
Gets a new sample, analyzes it
with an amazing chemical
detector upstairs, right?
Its olfactory region,
and does it at five times a second.
On average, a dog when it's
sniffing for something,
five times a second repetitive sine wave.
So that's what makes the dog
this incredible sampling system.
It kind of didn't matter the breed of dog.
Somehow their evolution
allowed them to figure out,
okay, one over five seconds is what I need
before I take the next
puff or the next inhale.
If the dog had infinite lung capacity,
and it just inhaled constantly,
it has a very limited reach.
But because of this in
and out bellows effect,
its reach goes up by
roughly a factor of 18.
We have a number of commercially
available vapor detectors,
okay? Because some of
these are really good
for various explosives and drugs,
some are very good for chemical
and biological hazards,
but they all just inhale air.
What we did is we designed and printed
what are essentially nostrils
that plug onto this thing
and make it sniff like a dog.
And then by doing a set
of controlled experiments,
by moving your vapor
source farther and farther,
we were able to, on average,
improve the detection
capabilities of these
by roughly a factor of 16 to 18.
- Whoa1
- Just by making them
sniff like a real dog.
- We're able to see this dog breath
using Schlieren imaging.
I've actually done a video on this before.
- This is an automotive headlamp.
After that, I have a condenser lens,
so it takes this light and
focuses it down to a point.
So from there our light diverges,
and it comes up and it fills our mirror.
Think of these light
beams as arrows, okay?
And there are a bunch of
arrows that are coming up,
they're straight as can be,
but when they pass something
of a different refractive index,
which could be the heat from my hand,
or a different density,
which could be a gas
of a different density,
those light rays, they shift a little bit,
they shift very slightly, okay?
They refract, they bend.
Then they all come back.
So we're coming back here,
and right here we have a two-way mirror.
So light can travel through
the mirror this way,
but when it comes back,
it turns 90 degrees.
And if you look right
here, I have a razor blade.
And what this is doing,
it is positioned exactly at
the focal point of that mirror.
I have that razor blade edge,
it's able to move in and
out of the focal plane.
And so what I do is I cut
off those arrows of light,
those beams of light that
shifted a little bit,
and I cut 'em off, I block 'em.
As I move the knife edge out,
so I'm not cutting off
any light right now,
so you basically have a
really expensive mirror,
it's not doing anything for you.
But as I take this razor blade,
and push it in,
you start to see, you know,
turbulence in the air,
and as I take it more and
more, yeah, there you go,
get your hand in there.
- Whoa, your Schlieren setup is
so much better than mine.
- So take a look at this.
So this is in a Shadowgraph system.
- Wow.
- So it's Schlieren's
little brother, okay?
It's not a Schlieren
system, but it's very close,
a Shadowgraph.
Shadowgraph is not as sensitive, okay?
But it's easier to build.
Look, we have a flashlight
and a white wall,
and we're already seeing
a shadowgraph there.
- So why does this work?
- What's happening is we have light,
it's not as focused as I would like,
but the more focus, the better.
The light's coming up this way,
it's passing through a hot
flame of a different density
and refractive index,
and we're basically casting
a shadow of that plume
on the wall, which is why
it's called a Shadowgraph.
- These can still be used
to visualize flow patterns
in detail.
Just by looking at the
footage of guns fired
in a Shadowgraph,
we can actually figure out
the speed of the bullet
and how loud the bang was.
- And there's our bullet whizzing off,
it is supersonic because it
has a very small bow shock.
You see it there?
- Yep.
- Very, very small.
So it's, you know, roughly
what Mach 1.05 maybe,
just above sonic.
Compare that to the
infamous AK47 assault rifle.
There's two things that we can
qualitatively observe here.
One is, if you compare these side to side,
the Smith & Wesson versus the AK47,
the darkness of this line is different.
This is a quieter firearm,
it's not as loud,
the report is not as loud.
- Because
it's less pronounced.
- [Matt] It's less pronounced, yep.
- The hot gases released
when the gun is fired expand outwards,
creating a shockwave.
Across this shock,
the pressure, temperature,
and density of the air changes rapidly.
And the bigger that change,
the darker this shows up
in the Shadowgraph.
So you can get a sense of how loud it is
by how dark that shock appears.
- And then here we see our
bullet whizzing off at about,
oh gosh, Mach two,
- two and a half,
- It's like
two, three degrees, right?
- You could actually measure that
and calculate the Mach number.
- Any object moving
through air creates pressure
waves that travel out
at the speed of sound.
Since this bullet is moving
faster than the speed of sound,
the pressure waves it creates
all get compressed together
into a single conical shock wave.
It's like a tiny sonic boom.
And you can use this to determine
the speed of the bullet.
The sine of the angle is the
ratio of the speed of sound
to the speed of the object.
There is a different
way to visualize flow,
which is with a laser sheet.
It illuminates fine particles.
So we can see the plumes of
gun powder residue created
when a gun is fired.
- We call this laser light sheet.
And the reason is, okay,
so now our light's there,
I can barely see it because I
have laser safety glasses on.
- Yep. I can only see it in the camera.
- Yeah, so what's happening
here is we have a laser beam,
and we send it, we steer it
through a cylindrical glass rod.
All it is, is a piece of
glass that's a cylinder.
And what that does is it spreads that beam
into a two-dimensional
wall of laser light. Okay?
And so the way this works is
whenever particles or theatrical fog cross
through this sheet, they
light up because of the laser.
There's a lot of effort now going
into understanding gunshot residue.
So gunshot residue is the kind of burned
and unburned propellant that occurs
whenever a firearm is discharged, right?
So what we're looking at
here is using laser lights
and high speed cameras,
is we're looking at the
plume of gunshot residue
that's generated after a firing event.
This is looking at ventilation
inside an actual gun range.
But look at all this.
This is all gunshot
residue that you can't see
with the naked eye, but is there,
so you can imagine if
you're inside a home,
this is five shots in a few seconds.
Enormous amounts of material.
A lot of this is landing on
the hands of the shooter,
but unfortunately a lot of
it is also being dispersed
into the local environment.
- It goes way farther than I expected.
- So the question is, can we differentiate
between something that's
actually been done by the shooter
and something, say, by a
bystander that walked in
two minutes later?
So that this is what we're actively trying
to pursue right now.
So these are tools and techniques
that we use here at NIST
that are qualitative or
sometimes semi-quantitative,
but they really help
illustrate what's happening.
And then the public security part of this,
deals with trace contraband detection.
We're all generating heat, right?
So we all have this warm plume
of air. You wanna see it?
I'll show you. It's kind of crazy.
So you seeing it there?
So that is called the human thermal plume.
And guess what's in that plume?
- Water?
- Parts of me. Skin cells.
- No way.
- Yeah.
So we're shedding skin cells
at a pretty creepy rate.
I forget what the number
is, but it's a lot.
Thousands an hour-ish.
So we are shedding these
skin cells constantly,
and it's actually not
necessarily a bad thing
from a trace detection standpoint.
- What do you mean?
- Well, whenever we are
talking about trace detection,
whether it's drugs or explosives,
it's all based on this
fundamental principle,
it's called Locard's Exchange Principle.
It's in forensic science.
It's that every contact leaves a trace.
And what that means is when
you're done in this lab,
there will be parts of you
left behind in this lab,
whether you like it or not, right?
'Cause we're all shedding
skin cells and taking things,
and taking stuff with us.
So if I'm a bomb maker, if
I'm involved in manufacturing,
you know, illegal fentanyl in my basement,
I am ultimately contaminating
myself with the bulk material.
And this contamination comes
in the form of very, very small particles.
And the chemical detection systems
that we have available
now are so sensitive,
they can detect a single particle of say,
an explosive residue.
Imagine you have a bomb
in a package, right?
And you're at some kind of
screening facility, right?
You're at a facility
that maybe is screening things
coming in from overseas,
maybe you've got a sniffer,
you've got a commercially
available vapor detector,
and you've got 10 seconds
to sample this package.
Where do you point your device, right?
These are the kinds of experiments
that help us understand where
you should point your device.
We call this burping.
We're burping the package.
So we have some acetone in here.
So wherever you burp it,
where you squeeze it,
you have acetone vapor coming
out of all the gaps, right?
So they're coming out in the gaps,
so that gap gives you the highest chance
of actually detecting
what's inside, right?
You don't want to go over
here where there's no gaps.
You don't want to go up
there where there's no gap.
You want to go in these corners here,
where stuff is actually
kind of permeating through
and outside of the box.
This is some recent work we're doing.
We are basically simulating
illicit drug manufacturing.
So here's some talc powder, right?
No big deal. I'm gonna
shake it up a little bit.
When I open this and squeeze,
I can't see anything,
but are you seeing anything in the camera?
- Yes.
- So again, to the naked eye,
we'd never be able to see this.
But because the laser is
doing the illuminating for us,
we're able to see this.
Let's do a little experiment
where I am taking illegal substance A
and pouring it into substance B.
First thing I'll do,
just watch when I take
the lid off of this.
(tense music)
Take it from here.
- There is a little bit coming off,
yeah.
- A little bit?
- Oh yeah.
It's still going.
- So just imagine, you're in a basement,
and you're building stuff like this,
and you don't realize that there's all
this contamination spreading and landing
on other surfaces in your room.
And I can't talk about the numbers,
but they're pretty startling.
- Like there's a lot.
- There's a lot.
- It spreads everywhere.
- There's a lot, yeah.
(tense music)
This thing's going to be full of smoke in here. You ready?
- Yep.
(tense music)
What I really love about
the laser sheet technique is
it allows you to visualize the
turbulence that's in the air.
- [Matt] So this is a way
we can see how the air flow
in the room is actually being tracked.
- Oh, that's nice.
- [Matt] Yep.
If you look at the
graph and the top right,
that is actually real-time
counts of the particles
that are being generated
around this person.
So that plot represents
basically inhalation exposure
of the materials that he's working with.
That's crazy, if you think about,
'cause if that's fentanyl,
and that person doesn't have
a mask on, they're gone.
We add fluorescent powder
to this kind of stuff,
so we can actually visualize
where the contamination goes.
The other cool part of this is
that we can use a quantitative method
of sampling surfaces in the house.
We basically use swabbing.
And it's the same idea
when you go to the airport.
Have you ever gone there
and they ask for your hands?
- Yeah.
- Right? And they take
a little swab and they wipe your hands.
What they're doing is they're looking
for these trace amounts
of explosive particles
that could be on you if you were involved
in the manufacture of
an explosive device.
But that's a drone.
That's looking at a drone.
And the question is, 'cause you know,
you get this cool prop wash,
and these four propellers
that are are all
interacting with each other.
So the question is, can
we use the fluid dynamics
of a drone to do the sampling for us?
And here's what I mean by that.
If there is a suspected, you know,
manufacturing facility of something,
say it's a methamphetamine or fentanyl,
you know, it's very, very expensive
to get Hazmat crews involved.
Have them come, they have to
gown up, they have to go in,
to a potential really dangerous situation.
What if we had a drone?
We just flew the drone in, right?
It buzzes around and it's got
some special kind of collector
on the belly of the drone
and we're using the prop wash
of the drone to stir up
particles off of a surface,
and then somehow inhale
them, collect them.
The drone comes back to base,
you run your chemical analysis, you say,
okay, the house is clean,
or no, we found stuff.
Okay, now it's time to pull
out the Hazmat crew. You know?
So the big-picture idea
that I want you to keep
in the back of your head the whole time is
this idea of public safety and security.
So that's really what happens in this lab.
But underneath that kind of umbrella term,
think mask research.
So when the Covid pandemic hit,
we kind of switched gears in
here to try to address some
of the issues related to masks.
This thing will actually
breathe as a human does,
that human happens to be me.
So I measured my own
kind of breathing rate,
and then built a system,
kinda engineered a pneumatic
system that replicates that,
but it also has a fog
machine, a fog generator.
So this thing basically just
looks like it took a drag off
of a cigarette and exhaled.
What's kind of cool with this is
it looks like there's nothing
coming through, right?
But there is millions and millions
of particles trying to make it through.
Some do, 'cause it's not 100%.
So I wrote an image-processing code.
So you take this information,
you plug it into a code,
and it analyzes,
based on pixels and it's
counting white pixels,
and sure enough, if you use an N95,
you put an N95 on here,
you run it through an
image processing code,
guess what percentage of
pixels light up white?
- 5%?
- 5%.
- Okay.
- Now I just want you
to breathe naturally.
So when you're inhaling, it gets dark.
And when you're exhaling, it gets lighter,
because the air is being
warmed by your lungs
and then coming back out.
- Like it's interesting
how fast you can see
the effect of the breathing in,
like just makes it go dark so quickly.
- But that shows me that,
like this now doesn't change color at all.
So this is being used
to seal versus filter.
I notice the color
change is a lot more dramatic.
- Yeah.
- With this, you know, it was in and out.
- I feel like that's
a thinner mask, right?
- [Matt] Yeah. So the
heat transfer-through,
it is gonna be greater.
- I feel like there's a lot coming out
over the top.
- There is, yeah,
there's a lot.
If you just breathe naturally,
you'll see a lot coming out there.
- The thing with masks, right, is like,
initially they were
like, masks don't work,
don't wear a mask.
And then they were like, masks do work,
like, and wear a cloth mask,
and then they were like, no,
no cloth masks don't work,
like, I don't know, there
was a lot of confusion
around masks.
- What we learned early on
was that the communication of,
you know, mask effectiveness
could have been improved,
right? And so that's kind
of why I did what we did
with the Schlieren.
The truth is, the average
American is not gonna sit down
and read a scientific journal article.
But they will sit down and
watch a 90-second video
of me coughing with a mask on and off.
And that's what we did.
It's kind of a unique relationship we have
with other federal agencies here.
So you have a three-letter
agency that has a specific need
for something, right?
In the security arena.
What they'll often do is
they'll come here to NIST,
and they'll say,
hey, we're really interested
in sampling people's shoes
for explosives for whatever reason, right?
So what we do here, and
in this lab in particular,
is we figure out what are
some good ways to sample shoes
for explosives?
What are some not so good ways, right?
What do the measurements need to look like
to evaluate a shoe-sampling system
that doesn't even exist yet?
And then what do the
standards need to look like
that support those measurements, right?
And so we figure all this
stuff out in the lab,
package it up nice and neat,
give it back to the sponsoring agency,
and then they take it to industry.
And industry already has a
leg up on the development
of these kinds of systems,
because we did a lot of the
heavy lifting here in the lab.
Because with the success of, you know,
doing the Covid-related visualization,
we're realizing now that
the application space
for this kind of technology is huge.
Indoor air quality.
You can imagine a bigger
mirror where we could look
at two people interacting with each other,
and what that transfer looks like
from one person to the other.
The take-home message
is flow visualization
is a critical tool that
we use here at NIST
to really help understand
what's happening, right?
It's one thing to do quantitative analysis
on various surfaces, but now we can see,
we can actually see what's happening,
and where these particles are generated.

Perfect lighting isn't just important
for visualizing air flow,
it's also essential for making
your house feel welcoming,
cozy and safe.
And with the sponsor of this
video, Caseta by Lutron,
you can easily set up
your own perfect lighting.
You know, Caseta provides
premium smart lighting control,
including switches, remotes
and plug-in smart dimmers,
which allow you to
customize your home lighting
from anywhere in the house.
What I love about smart switches is
that one switch can
control many regular bulbs.
So you can effectively
make all your bulbs smart
just by replacing the switch.
And installation is easy.
First, make sure you turn
off power to the switch,
and then disconnect the existing wires,
and connect them to Caseta's Smart Switch.
If you need any help, they're
just a click or a call away.
And then with the Smart Hub,
you can turn your lights on
and off just using your phone.
Or you can use another device,
like Alexa or Google Assistant.
Caseta works with more smart home brands
than any other smart
lighting control system.
Plus their switches don't rely on Wi-Fi,
so they always stay connected,
and you always have
control over your lights.
I personally like setting
timers in my house,
for example the lights
in my office turn on
by themselves in the evening.
And this gives me peace of mind
that my family will always
come home to a well-lit house.
And the best part of it all
is if I'm already in bed,
I can just check which
lights are still on,
and turn them off without
having to run around the house.
