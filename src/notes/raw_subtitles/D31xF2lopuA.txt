Welcome
 to
 the
 Daybreak
 Asia
 podcast.


I'm
 Doug
 Krer.
 Some
 renewed
 tension


today
 in
 the
 US
 China
 relationship.
 It


was
 early
 on
 Tuesday
 that
 China


sanctioned
 five
 US
 units
 of
 the
 South


Korean
 shipping
 firm
 Hana
 Ocean
 Company.


And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 Beijing
 threatened


more
 retaliation.
 Then
 later
 in
 the
 day,


we
 heard
 from
 US
 trade
 rep
 Jameson


Greer.
 He
 told
 CNBC
 President
 Trump
 was


still
 set
 to
 meet
 with
 Chinese
 President


Xi
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.


>> Right
 now,
 there
 there
 is
 a
 plan.


There's
 a
 scheduled
 time
 for
 that.
 It's


on
 the
 schedule.
 It's
 there's
 there's
 a


scheduled
 time
 for
 that.
 Um,
 you
 know,


whether
 it'll
 go
 through
 or
 not,
 I
 don't


want
 to
 pre-commit
 either
 ourselves
 or


the
 Chinese.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 it
 makes


sense
 for
 people
 to
 talk
 uh
 when
 they


can.
 So
 Jameson
 Greer's
 remarks
 helped


provide
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 hope
 for


negotiation.
 But
 then
 near
 the
 close
 of


US
 trading,
 President
 Trump
 said
 the
 US


might
 stop
 trade
 in
 cooking
 oil
 with


China.
 And
 he
 framed
 this
 potential
 move


as
 retaliation
 against
 Beijing
 for
 its


refusal
 to
 buy
 American
 soybeans.
 For
 a


closer
 look
 now
 at
 the
 state
 of
 US
 China


trade,
 I'm
 joined
 by
 Sandra
 Schwarzki.


She
 is
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 the


advisory
 firm
 Integer.
 She
 joins
 us
 from


Washington,
 DC.
 Sandra,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 making
 time
 to
 chat
 with
 me.
 Do


you
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 where
 we
 are
 in
 this


process
 of
 the
 US
 and
 China
 attempting


to
 reach
 some
 type
 of
 workable
 path


forward?


>> Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 on.
 I
 think


it's
 safe
 to
 say
 that
 both
 China
 and
 the


US
 have
 plenty
 of
 balls
 that
 they
 can


put
 in
 the
 air
 and
 they're
 increasingly


doing
 that
 from
 tariffs
 to


export
 controls
 on
 key
 uh
 rare
 earth


minerals
 in
 the
 case
 of
 China
 and
 key


semiconductors
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 US
 to


agricultural
 products.


And
 it
 appears
 that
 both
 sides
 in


anticipation
 in
 the
 leadup
 to
 what
 are


supposed
 to
 be
 trade
 talks


uh
 later
 this
 month,
 both
 sides
 are


throwing
 everything
 they
 have
 at
 each


other
 to
 try
 to
 gain
 some
 leverage
 at


these
 talks.
 So
 one
 could
 look
 at
 this


really
 as
 posturing.


Um
 but
 it
 is
 it
 is
 it
 is
 very
 unsettling


given
 the
 two
 given
 these
 superpowers.


>> It
 certainly
 has
 helped
 to
 contribute
 to


a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 in
 markets.
 That's


for
 sure.
 Moments
 ago,
 we
 learned
 that


Apple
 is
 preparing
 to
 expand
 its


manufacturing
 operations
 in
 Vietnam.


It's
 part
 of
 a
 push
 on
 the
 part
 of
 Apple


to
 lessens
 its
 dependence
 on
 China.
 This


is
 something
 the
 company's
 been
 pretty


transparent
 about
 in
 the
 past
 and
 for


years
 we've
 seemed
 to
 kind
 of
 attempt
 to


focus
 on
 this
 issue
 of
 decoupling


between
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 It
 seems
 that


that's
 inevitable,
 right?
 That
 these
 two


very
 large
 economies,
 the
 largest
 in
 the


world,
 are
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 begin
 to


become
 less
 dependent
 on
 one
 another.


>> I
 think
 it
 makes
 complete
 sense.
 They're


looking
 for
 other
 supply
 chains
 because


the
 US
 is
 a
 supply
 chain
 to
 China
 and


vice
 versa.
 It
 just
 isn't
 working.
 And


so
 just
 like
 uh
 just
 like
 Apple,
 the
 US


and
 China
 are
 looking
 for
 other


countries
 to
 supply
 the
 raw
 materials,


the
 goods
 that
 they
 need
 so
 that
 so
 that


they
 can
 continue
 to
 advance
 the
 these


super
 technologies


that
 are
 going
 to
 revolutionize


uh
 our
 day-to-day
 lives.
 I
 think


recently
 I
 saw
 that
 um
 Australia
 has


ramped
 up
 its
 production
 of
 rare
 earth


minerals
 which
 is
 increasingly
 important


to
 the
 US
 and
 to
 all
 of
 our
 advanced


technologies.
 But
 even
 even
 with
 them


ramping
 up
 it
 is
 it
 is
 hardly
 going
 to


replace
 if
 it
 needs
 to
 replace
 hardly


going
 to
 replace
 what
 we're
 buying
 from


China.
 So
 lately,
 as
 a
 part
 of
 this
 tit


fortat,
 President
 Trump
 threatened
 new


tariffs
 of
 100%
 on
 Chinese
 goods
 that


would
 be
 imported
 by
 the
 United
 States.


There
 are
 already
 a
 number
 of
 tariffs
 in


place.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the


markets
 have
 been
 wrestling
 with
 is


whether
 or
 not
 these
 tariffs
 are
 going


to
 produce
 much
 higher
 inflation.
 Now,


we
 really
 haven't
 seen
 much
 of
 that.


Although
 there
 is
 the
 suggestion
 that


inflation
 expectations
 on
 the
 part
 of


consumers
 are
 beginning
 to
 rise.
 How
 do


you
 feel
 about
 the
 way
 in
 which
 these


tariffs
 potentially
 have
 the
 ability
 to


contribute
 to
 a
 higher
 rate
 of
 inflation


in
 the
 US?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 think


that
 when
 tariffs
 started
 to
 go
 north


back
 in
 the
 spring,
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 lot


of
 concern
 that
 consumers
 were
 going
 to


feel
 the
 pinch
 almost
 immediately.
 And


what
 we
 saw
 was
 that
 June
 came,
 July,


August,
 and
 the
 and
 the
 inflation
 rate,


the
 pain
 point
 for
 consumers
 just
 wasn't


there.
 And
 in
 large
 part,
 it's
 because


businesses
 weren't
 passing
 along
 the


tariffs
 to
 consumers.
 They
 didn't
 want


to
 lock
 out
 their
 their
 customers
 and
 so


they
 ate
 those
 those
 tariffs.


At
 this
 point,
 tariffs
 are
 um
 are


becoming
 so
 high
 and
 companies
 and


businesses


are
 uh
 are
 are
 not
 able
 to
 continue
 to


eat
 those
 extra
 costs.
 The
 concern
 now


is
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see


higher
 prices
 um
 because
 of
 those


tariffs
 hitting
 consumers
 right
 when
 we


start
 to
 head
 into
 the
 holiday
 season


when
 the
 store
 shelves
 are
 packed
 with


all
 the
 goodies
 that
 we
 want
 to
 buy
 and


we've
 all
 got
 Amazon
 purchases
 on
 our


minds.
 Now
 there's
 a
 there
 is
 a
 greater


concern
 that
 inflation
 is
 going
 to
 begin


to
 pinch
 the
 consumer


>> and
 I
 think
 that
 may
 be
 a
 little


troubling
 for
 the
 Fed.
 Although
 we
 heard


from
 Chair
 Jay
 Powell
 today
 and
 a
 lot
 of


his
 focus
 continues
 to
 be
 on
 this


weakness
 in
 the
 labor
 market.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 very
 very
 interesting
 to
 see
 how


the
 Fed
 navigates
 this
 terrain
 and
 at


what
 point
 the
 Fed
 really
 has
 to
 do
 a


better
 job
 of
 balancing
 the
 risk
 between


weakness
 in
 the
 labor
 market
 with
 the


potential
 for
 very
 very
 sticky


inflation.
 But
 if
 the
 market
 has
 to
 dial


back
 from
 expectations
 of
 aggressive
 Fed


easing
 given
 the
 clients
 that
 you
 have,


the
 folks
 that
 you
 speak
 to
 in


Washington,
 would
 that
 be
 deeply


concerning?
 Are
 these
 people
 that
 you


speak
 with
 very
 dependent
 on
 the
 idea


that
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 easier
 monetary


policy?


>> I
 think
 the
 expectation
 um
 after


September
 and
 in
 the
 leadup
 to
 the
 next


Fed
 meeting
 is
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see


another
 cut.
 Maybe
 not
 in
 October
 but


certainly
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 we


are
 going
 to
 see
 another
 cut
 uh
 based
 in


large
 part
 on
 the
 weakening
 job
 market.


Now,
 we
 don't
 have
 numbers
 uh


prospective
 numbers
 because
 the


government
 is
 shut
 down
 and
 so
 all
 of


the
 um
 all
 of
 those
 indicators
 are
 not


being
 supplied
 by
 the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor


Statistics.
 So,
 we
 have
 some
 really
 good


guesses
 based
 upon
 some
 private
 sector


data
 and
 all
 of
 those
 uh
 and
 all
 of
 that


data
 looks
 like
 it
 is
 a
 much
 uh
 weakened


job
 market.
 Um,
 and
 that
 is
 going
 to


play
 into
 the
 Fed's
 decision
 to
 perhaps


lower
 interest
 rates.
 But
 again,
 they're


looking
 at
 all
 of
 the
 the
 the
 threat
 of


all
 the
 increased
 tariffs,
 which
 at
 100%


coming
 out
 of
 China
 on
 on
 all
 those


Chinese
 input
 uh
 imports
 will
 affect


consumers,
 will
 affect
 inflation.
 So,


boy,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 envy
 their
 uh
 their


next
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 M
 I'm
 curious,


Sandra,
 given
 the
 client
 base
 that
 you


have,
 how
 do
 they
 feel
 about
 the
 way
 in


which
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has
 been


been
 managing
 the
 economy,
 whether
 it's


tariffs
 or
 tax
 policy,
 deregulation?
 I


mean,
 is
 there
 a
 consensus
 here
 that


that
 you
 can
 address
 or
 is
 there
 a
 kind


of
 a
 range
 of
 opinion
 in
 terms
 of
 how


the
 administration
 is
 doing?


So,
 I
 think
 when
 the
 administration


first
 took
 office
 and
 the
 and
 our


clients
 saw
 the
 tariff
 threats
 and
 the


and
 the
 saber
 rattling
 and
 the
 rest,


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 concern
 and
 a
 lot
 of


pause,
 but
 they've
 come
 to
 expect
 some


of
 that.
 In
 some
 cases,
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 normalized
 the


threatening
 tariffs
 and
 the
 saber


rattling.
 And
 despite


uh
 what
 appears
 to
 be
 instability
 in
 the


government,
 the
 market
 continues
 to
 go


up.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 market
 um
 and
 our


clients
 that
 rely
 on
 the
 market
 and
 are


part
 of
 the
 market


feel
 like
 they've
 uh
 and
 believe
 that


they
 have
 figured
 out
 the
 secret
 sauce,


figured
 out
 that
 the
 administration
 is


going
 to
 continue
 to
 threaten
 and
 to


provoke.


But


many
 of
 them
 believe
 that
 uh
 that
 will


have
 little
 real
 impact
 in
 the
 long
 term


on
 the
 market
 or
 their
 companies.
 There


may
 be
 some
 short-term
 instability
 and


volatility
 but
 long
 term
 they
 believe


that
 uh
 the
 president
 wants
 a
 strong


economy
 and
 will
 do
 what
 he
 and
 and and


is
 doing
 what
 he's
 doing
 in
 order
 to
 get


us
 to
 a
 stronger
 economy.
 Even
 though
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 dayto-day
 it
 does
 not
 it


it
 seems
 it's
 it's
 very
 unsettling.


>> Sandra
 we'll
 leave
 it
 there.
 Thank
 you


so
 very
 much.
 Sandra
 Schwarzki
 is
 the


founder
 also
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 advisory


firm
 Integer
 joining
 us
 from
 Washington


DC.
 In
 a
 moment
 or
 two
 we'll
 bring
 in


Rob
 Williams
 from
 Sage
 Advisory


Services.
 He's
 in
 Austin,
 Texas.
 And


we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 interest
 rate


environment
 and
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


fixed
 income
 space
 coming
 up
 here
 on
 the


Daybreak
 Asia
 podcast.


Welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Daybreak
 Asia


podcast.
 I'm
 Doug
 Krer.
 The
 earning


season
 is
 underway
 in
 the
 US
 and
 in
 the


last
 session
 we
 heard
 from
 several
 of


the
 big
 banks.
 The
 results
 were
 by
 and


large
 pretty
 solid
 although
 the


commentary
 seemed
 to
 be
 a
 little
 mixed.


We
 had
 bank
 stocks
 finishing
 mixed
 as


well.
 The
 KBW
 Bank
 index
 was
 up
 1.8%
 but


it
 closed
 off
 its
 session
 high.
 For
 a


look
 at
 the
 earning
 season,
 I'm
 joined


by
 Rob
 Williams.
 He
 is
 managing
 partner,


also
 the
 chief
 investment
 strategist
 at


Sage
 Advisory
 Services.
 Rob
 is
 based
 in


Austin,
 Texas.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


making
 time
 to
 chat
 with
 me.
 Give
 me


your
 sense
 of
 what
 you
 heard
 today
 from


the
 big
 banks.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 we
 look
 we're
 think


manager.
 We
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 investing
 in


credit
 obviously
 and
 and
 we're
 very


concerned
 about
 the
 consumer.
 So
 we


wanted
 the
 overall
 thing
 we
 wanted
 to


see
 is
 uh
 any
 read
 on
 on
 insight
 on
 the


consumer
 especially
 kind
 of
 uh
 write


downs
 things
 like
 that
 and
 overall
 like


you
 said
 earlier
 very
 healthy
 driven
 a


lot
 by
 IPO
 activity
 trading
 revenue


things
 like
 that
 uh
 not
 much
 damage
 you


know
 these
 big
 banks
 hold
 very
 little


limited
 subprime
 auto
 type
 of
 exposure


or
 anything
 that
 would
 have
 hurt
 them


that
 much
 so
 pretty
 positive
 overall
 but


but
 the
 comments
 uh
 like
 You
 also
 said


kind
 of
 looking
 forward
 uh
 not
 not
 as


optimistic
 as
 as
 kind
 of
 the
 current
 run


rate
 that
 you've
 seen
 you
 know
 slow
 down


the
 consumer
 maybe
 some
 cracks
 on
 the


credit
 side.
 You've
 seen
 a
 few
 little


cracks
 and
 you
 know
 and
 we
 all
 know
 how


tight
 credit
 spreads
 are.
 So
 there's
 not


a
 lot
 of
 room
 uh
 for
 any
 kind
 of
 you


know
 bigger
 systemic
 sort
 of
 crisis


would
 would
 certainly
 impact
 uh
 the


credit
 markets
 overall.


>> So
 I'm
 glad
 you
 mentioned
 Jamie
 Diamond


there
 the
 CEO
 of
 JP
 Morgan.
 He
 was


warning
 today
 of
 a
 potential


deterioration
 in
 credit
 quality.
 Now
 you


and
 I
 both
 know
 that
 lately
 we
 have
 seen


the
 implosion
 ofricolor


holdings
 the
 auto
 lender
 as
 well
 as
 the


car
 parts
 supplier
 first
 brands
 and


Diamond
 was
 remarking
 when
 he
 sees


situations
 like
 this
 his
 antenna
 go
 up


and
 he
 also
 said
 when
 you
 see
 one


cockroach
 there
 are
 probably
 more.
 Does


he
 have
 a
 point
 there?


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 look
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 opaque


sides
 of
 the
 credit
 market
 now
 in


private
 credit
 and
 other
 and
 other


things.
 So
 for
 sure
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 a


little
 more
 dispersion
 amongst
 some
 of


these
 BDC's
 and
 other
 things
 because


there
 are
 some
 problems
 under
 there


whether
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 big
 enough


to
 bleed
 up
 to
 you
 know
 investment
 grade


credit
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 see
 that


happening
 anytime
 soon
 but
 we
 certainly


think
 it's
 not
 a
 bad
 time
 to
 be
 thinking


about
 hey
 should
 I
 be
 moving
 up
 in


liquidity
 in
 my
 income
 side
 of
 my


portfolio
 right
 you
 know
 bank
 you
 know


bank
 reserves
 have
 been
 going
 down
 bank


reserves
 serves
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 GDP,


which
 is
 what
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 Fed


measures
 sort
 of
 when
 we're
 in
 ample


liquidity
 situation.
 That's
 been
 kind
 of


getting
 down
 lower
 and
 lower,
 kind
 of


out
 of
 that
 band
 of
 like
 ample.
 So
 maybe


liquidity
 shrinking
 a
 little
 bit.
 We've


seeing
 some
 cracks.
 Not
 a
 bad
 time
 to


stay
 in
 more
 liquid,
 transparent,
 higher


uh
 you
 know,
 not
 just
 higher
 quality,


but
 but
 lower
 volatility
 kind
 of
 markets


in
 the
 fixed
 income
 space.
 Well,
 that


takes
 us
 to
 Fed
 Chair
 Jay
 Powell.
 Today,


he
 kind
 of
 reinforced
 bets
 on
 a
 rate
 cut


in
 October.
 That
 shouldn't
 be
 a
 big


surprise
 if
 you've
 been
 tracking
 the
 Fed


speak.
 A
 number
 of
 policy
 makers
 have


been
 very
 concerned
 about
 the
 weakness


of
 the
 labor
 market.
 Powell
 also


indicated
 the
 Fed
 may
 stop
 shrinking
 its


balance
 sheet
 in
 the
 coming
 months
 as
 a


way
 of
 perhaps
 maintaining,
 to
 your


point,
 a
 little
 of
 the
 liquidity,


especially
 in
 the
 overnight
 funding


markets.
 So
 are
 you
 really
 seeing


evidence
 now
 that
 things
 are
 kind
 of


drying
 up
 a
 bit?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 bankers
 have
 certainly
 been


run
 down,
 right?
 And
 the
 Fed
 has
 has,


you
 know,
 been
 engaging
 in
 triggering


their
 balance
 sheet
 for
 a
 while.
 They've


said
 when
 when
 when
 liquidity
 is
 is
 gone


from
 excessive
 to
 ample
 uh
 is
 when
 they


would
 think
 about
 shutting
 down
 QT.
 And


we're
 we're
 in
 that
 zone.
 We're
 the


bottom
 of
 that
 zone.
 I
 think
 some
 of
 the


governors
 has
 pointed
 at
 put
 the
 number


in
 that
 kind
 of
 12
 10
 to
 12%
 of
 GDP
 for


bank
 reserves.
 We're
 right
 around
 10.
 So


we're
 right
 at
 the
 lower
 end
 of
 that.
 So


the
 good
 news
 is
 uh
 they're
 probably


getting
 ready
 to
 fold
 up
 that
 and
 and


NQT.
 The
 bad
 news
 is
 that
 yeah,


liquidity
 has
 shrunk
 a
 little
 bit.
 It's


not
 it's
 not
 like
 tight
 at
 this
 moment,


but
 like
 I
 said
 earlier,
 maybe
 a
 good


time
 to
 be
 thinking
 about,
 hey,
 I
 want


to
 be
 a
 little
 more
 uh
 you
 know,
 liquid


in
 my
 fixed
 income
 side.


>> I'm
 curious
 about
 how
 you
 view
 the
 macro


these
 days,
 particularly
 in
 the
 absence


of
 a
 lot
 of
 government
 data.
 We've
 been


lacking
 some
 key
 data
 points
 here


because
 of
 the
 shutdown
 and
 the
 CPI


report,
 which
 was
 to
 have
 been
 released


tomorrow.
 That
 would
 have
 been
 the


October
 15th
 here
 in
 the
 States.
 It's


been
 pushed
 out
 to
 I
 think
 the
 24th.


Give
 me
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 you've
 had
 to


navigate
 this
 landscape
 right
 now


without
 a
 lack
 of
 or
 with
 a
 lack
 of


government
 data.


>> Yeah,
 that
 that
 is
 a
 problem,
 especially


if
 it
 continues
 on.
 You
 know,


fortunately,
 there's
 a
 good
 there's
 been


a
 you
 know,
 20
 years
 ago
 it
 would
 have


been
 more
 difficult,
 but
 there's
 been
 a


growing
 amount
 of
 sort
 of
 alternative


private
 data
 that
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 lean


into.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 Bloomberg


certainly,
 you
 know,
 has
 a
 has
 a
 good


read
 on
 that.
 There's
 even
 a
 worksheet


of
 of
 all
 the
 various
 private
 sources


like
 you
 had
 one
 today.
 The
 one
 piece
 of


data
 you
 had
 was
 small
 business


optimism,
 right?
 And
 that
 ticked
 down.


If
 you
 crack
 that
 open,
 there
 are
 some


inflation
 components
 to
 that.
 So,
 you


have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 more
 creative
 and


dig
 a
 little
 deeper.
 But
 that
 one,
 we
 we


actually
 look
 at
 that
 small
 business
 and


there's
 a
 reading
 in
 that
 that
 says,


hey,
 what
 percentage
 of
 small
 businesses


are
 expecting
 to
 increase
 prices?
 So,


it's
 a
 good
 indication
 of
 price


pressures.
 and
 that
 that's
 been
 ticking


up.
 So
 that
 tells
 us,
 yeah,
 this
 price


pressure
 is
 still
 coming
 and
 you
 have
 to


kind
 of
 lean
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other


alternative
 data
 sources
 for
 job
 uh
 the


job
 numbers
 and
 they
 basically
 been


telling
 you
 the
 same
 thing.
 Jobs
 are


weakening,
 pricing
 pressure
 is
 okay,
 but


we're
 seeing
 some
 sign
 that
 it's


starting
 to
 percolate.


>> Does
 that
 necessarily
 equate
 to


stagflation?


>> No,
 I
 I
 think
 because
 you
 just
 haven't


seen
 the
 goods,
 you're
 getting
 some
 stag


in
 the
 job
 numbers.
 um
 you
 know,
 but


you're
 not
 getting
 inflation
 coming


through
 that.
 The
 goods
 pass
 through
 has


not
 been
 that
 bad.
 The
 housing
 and
 the


energy
 and
 the
 service
 sector
 slowing


down
 has
 sort
 of
 contained
 that.
 What


we're
 kind
 of
 looking
 for
 is
 hey,
 you


know,
 we
 know
 inventories
 have
 been


built
 up,
 they're
 running
 down.
 And
 when


we
 start
 to
 see
 more
 margin
 pressures


and
 things
 like
 that
 small
 business


price
 index
 and
 and
 really
 starting
 to


come
 through,
 we
 get
 a
 little
 nervous.


But
 right
 now
 it
 looks
 more
 like
 the


Fed's
 going
 to
 be
 wor
 more
 and
 they've


said
 it
 more
 worried
 about
 jobs
 and


inflation.
 Uh
 at
 the
 moment


>> I'd
 like
 to
 get
 your
 view
 Rob
 on
 this


debasement
 trade
 that's
 been
 rippling


across
 not
 just
 markets
 here
 in
 the


states
 but
 globally
 as
 well.
 It
 seems


like
 a
 number
 of
 investors
 are
 pulling


away
 from
 sovereign
 debt
 chasing
 gold


maybe
 even
 silver.
 Give
 me
 your
 sense
 of


what's
 happening
 and
 what
 the
 risks
 are


right
 now.


Yeah,
 I
 you
 know
 uh
 there's
 there's
 many


reasons,
 but
 it's
 just
 like
 when
 you
 saw


that
 backend
 volatility
 in
 the
 curve,


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty


policy
 politically


uh
 for
 inflation.
 And
 there's
 also


deficits
 are
 not
 a
 US
 problem.
 They
 are


a
 global
 problem
 and
 they're
 not
 going


away
 anytime
 soon.
 So
 that's
 going
 to


kind
 of
 keep
 pushing
 people
 away
 from


some
 of
 the
 traditional
 things
 and
 get


and
 creating
 some
 volatility
 on
 the
 back


end
 of
 the
 curve
 and
 pushing
 people


towards
 gold
 and
 and
 things
 like
 and
 and


even
 crypto
 and
 things
 like
 that
 for
 and


it's
 it's
 not
 going
 away
 anytime
 soon,


but
 it's
 also
 from
 a
 rate
 perspective,
 I


I
 think
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 out
 of


hand
 either.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it'll
 be


contained
 because
 like
 I
 said,
 inflation


is
 not
 out
 of
 the
 bag
 here.
 Um
 the


supply
 demand
 for
 for
 rates
 and
 some
 of


this
 stuff
 is
 still
 pretty
 favorable.
 We


just
 talked
 about
 QT
 ending.
 Um
 you
 know


the
 Treasury
 is
 going
 to
 issue
 more


bills
 than
 long
 paper.
 So
 they're
 going


to
 do
 their
 level
 best
 to
 keep
 uh
 the


volatility
 sort
 of
 down
 at
 the
 long
 end


of
 the
 curve.
 Uh
 but
 people
 are


certainly
 the
 the
 driving
 force
 is
 I


think
 global
 deficits.
 So
 you
 wouldn't


be
 shunning
 US
 treasuries
 in
 favor
 of


highquality
 IG
 credit
 like
 a
 Microsoft


would
 you?


>> Uh
 no
 I
 look
 I'd
 have
 a
 diversified


portfolio.
 I
 wouldn't
 shy
 away
 from


duration,
 right?
 The
 cash
 is
 not
 going


to
 look
 is
 going
 to
 look
 increasingly


less
 attractive
 in
 an
 easing
 cycle,


right?
 You
 you've
 gotten
 good
 returns
 in


say
 fixed
 income,
 treasuries,
 IG,


credit,
 6
 7%,
 you're
 going to
 get
 just


in
 carry,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 another


percent
 and
 a
 half
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter


just
 in
 carry.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't


worry
 a
 whole
 lot
 about
 duration.
 And


and
 again,
 you're
 not
 if
 you're
 in
 a


diversified
 portfolio,
 you
 don't
 have
 a


lot
 of
 the
 extreme
 longend
 exposure
 if


that's
 what
 you're
 worried
 about.
 And


we're
 frankly,
 I'm
 not
 too
 worried
 about


having
 u
 that
 long
 end.
 But
 I'm
 just


saying
 typical
 investor
 is
 not
 going
 to


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 30-year
 paper.
 They're


going
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 1
 to


10year
 part
 of
 the
 curve
 anyhow.
 So,
 no,


I
 wouldn't
 shy
 away
 from
 duration
 or
 or


high
 quality
 fixed
 income.


>> Okay,
 Rob,
 we'll
 leave
 it
 there.

you
 so
 much.
