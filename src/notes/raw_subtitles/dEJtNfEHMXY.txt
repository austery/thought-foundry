hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangin
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 here
 with
 Rich
 shama
 one
 of


the
 most
 respected
 voices
 in
 global


economics
 and
 also
 the
 chair
 of


Rockefeller
 International
 now
 earlier


this
 year
 he
 published
 his
 book
 really


really
 good
 what
 went
 wrong
 with


capitalism
 and
 that's
 what
 we're
 going


to
 talk
 about
 today
 so
 rich
 warm
 welcome


thank
 you
 thank
 you
 for
 having
 me
 so


let's
 kick
 off
 with
 budget
 deficits
 why


are
 budget
 deficits
 a
 problem
 well


firstly
 that
 budget
 deficits
 have


apparently
 not
 been
 a
 problem
 for
 the


last
 uh
 50
 years
 or
 so
 because
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 pattern
 Let's
 Take
 America


as
 an
 example
 uh
 it's
 uh
 in
 it's
 300


years
 or
 so
 of
 existence
 in
 the
 first


250
 years
 America
 did
 not
 run
 a
 budget


deficit
 except
 when
 there
 was
 an


outright
 recession
 or
 there
 was
 like
 a


war
 going
 on
 the
 norm
 was
 to
 balance
 the


books
 or
 to
 run
 even
 surpluses
 then
 from


the
 197s
 that
 began
 to
 change
 why
 uh
 and


I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 that
 the


Habit
 then
 some
 people
 B
 it
 to
 the
 fact


that
 you
 had
 the
 end
 of
 the
 gold


standards
 so
 the
 discipline
 went
 away


and
 then
 this
 culture
 sort
 of
 crept
 in


which
 is
 that
 you
 can
 run
 budget


deficits
 and
 there
 are
 no
 consequences


to
 it
 uh
 and
 for
 the
 last
 50
 years
 I


think
 that
 America
 has
 run
 a
 budget


surplus
 for
 only
 five
 of
 the
 last
 50


years
 otherwise
 it's
 been
 a
 deficit


practically
 every
 year
 so
 when
 will
 it


become
 a
 problem
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are
 now


getting
 to
 that
 point
 and
 our
 a
 couple


of
 reasons
 for
 that
 one
 that


historically
 America's
 budget
 deficits


were
 still
 I'd
 say
 within
 the
 realm
 of


other
 nations
 you
 know
 so
 like
 in
 the
 uh


for
 the
 last
 uh
 20
 years
 or
 so
 the


budget
 deficit
 averaged
 around
 2
 3%
 of


GDP
 and
 most
 other
 developed
 countries


were
 running
 similar
 budget
 deficits
 now


in
 the
 last
 3
 to
 four
 years
 the
 average


budget
 deficit
 that
 America
 is
 running


has
 gone
 up
 to
 6%
 of
 GDP
 and
 uh
 if
 uh


the
 uh
 projections
 are
 right
 next
 year


that
 let's
 say
 the
 tax
 cuts
 are
 extended


uh
 and
 so
 the
 budget
 deficit
 in
 America


will
 get
 to
 7%
 of
 GDP
 why
 is
 it
 a


problem
 yeah
 it's
 a
 problem
 just
 because


of
 the
 fact
 that
 now
 we're
 getting
 to


levels
 where
 we
 are
 borrowing
 so
 much


that
 the
 auction
 sizes
 are
 also
 going
 to


become
 much
 larger
 now
 and
 the
 Market's


ability
 to
 absorb
 all
 this
 I
 think
 at


some
 point
 is
 going
 to
 come
 into


question
 and
 the
 issue
 you
 know
 there's


no
 science
 behind
 this
 and
 especially


because
 America
 has
 got
 the
 world's


Reserve
 currency
 so
 it
 has
 an
 ability
 to


run
 budget
 deficits
 that
 are
 far
 greater


than
 other
 countries
 would
 you
 mind
 just


explaining
 what
 a
 reserve
 currency
 is


yeah
 so
 the
 reserve
 currency
 is
 a


currency
 which
 most
 uh
 like
 everybody


uses
 as
 the
 main
 currency
 of
 reference


the
 main
 currency
 of
 transaction
 the


world
 in
 the
 last
 uh
 6
 700
 years
 has


always
 had
 one
 predominant
 currency
 that


is
 used
 in
 transactions
 around
 the
 world


last
 100
 years
 it's
 been
 the
 dollar


before
 that
 it
 used
 to
 be
 the
 pound


sterling
 before
 that
 the
 French
 Frank


and
 then
 before
 that
 the
 Spanish
 and
 the


Portuguese
 and
 the
 Dutch
 currencies
 and


if
 you
 are
 the
 reserve
 currency
 can
 you


have
 as
 much
 budget
 deficit
 as
 you
 want


uh
 for
 a
 while
 yes
 but
 eventually


remember
 that
 the
 reserve
 currency
 is


not
 a
 permanent
 status
 it's
 a
 long-term


status
 but
 not
 a
 permanent
 status
 the


average
 time
 that
 a
 country
 has
 been


able
 to
 have
 the
 world's
 Reserve


currency
 has
 been
 about
 100
 years
 or
 so


every
 100
 years
 the
 world's
 Reserve


currency
 tends
 to
 change
 what
 will
 make


it
 change
 when
 that
 firey
 becomes
 too


indebted
 it
 becomes
 too
 extended
 and
 the


world's
 trust
 in
 using
 that
 currency
 as


a
 reference
 declines
 and
 I
 think
 that


with
 America
 we
 are
 now
 getting
 to
 that


point
 where
 this
 has
 become
 a
 bit


ridiculous
 where
 America
 thinks
 that


they
 can
 run
 whatever
 budget
 deficit


they
 want
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 will


keep
 funding
 it
 and
 financing
 it
 and
 and


what
 what
 causes
 these
 tipping
 points


what
 is
 it
 that
 can
 make
 it
 a
 Tipping


Point
 well
 often
 it's
 not
 a
 Tipping


Point
 it
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 gradually


happens
 over
 time
 but
 it
 generally
 is


the
 you
 know
 when
 the
 investors
 the
 bond


market
 they
 begin
 to
 say
 enough
 is


enough
 we
 saw
 that
 with
 UK
 and
 Sterling


uh
 in
 the
 1950s
 60s
 and
 finally
 they
 had


a
 big
 crisis
 in
 the
 1970s
 and
 before


that
 we
 saw
 that
 with
 the
 French


currency
 so
 so
 we're
 not
 seeing
 it
 in


the
 States
 now
 yeah
 there
 is
 no
 sign
 of


it
 now
 at
 least
 explicitly
 uh
 there


other
 issues
 I
 address
 in
 the
 book
 as
 to


what
 are
 the
 consequences
 of
 the


government
 action
 which
 are
 leading
 to


lower
 productivity
 growth
 and
 which
 are


undermining
 economic
 growth
 well
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 that
 could
 cause
 a


moment
 where
 investors
 just
 decide


listen
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a
 much
 higher


price
 to
 lend
 money
 to
 a
 country
 right


so
 I
 think
 that
 generally
 when
 the


interest
 expenses
 become
 very
 high
 that


a
 lot
 of
 the
 budget
 now
 goes
 to
 just


paying
 off
 your
 interest
 expenses
 and


the
 price
 of
 money
 is
 also
 changed


remember
 that
 for
 the
 last
 20
 years
 or


so
 when
 you
 had
 virtually
 zero
 interest


rates
 it
 was
 much
 easier
 to
 fund
 these


budget
 deficits
 now
 we
 have
 moved
 to
 an


Era
 where
 interest
 rates
 are
 far
 higher


and
 the
 bond
 markets
 in
 other
 parts
 of


the
 world
 with
 other
 countries
 are


beginning
 to
 express
 their
 concern
 we


saw
 that
 in
 UK
 if
 you
 remember
 in
 2022


what
 was
 referred
 to
 back
 then
 famously


as
 the
 Liz
 trust
 moment
 when
 she
 tried


to
 expand
 the
 budget
 deficit
 by
 cutting


taxes
 and
 the
 market
 revolted
 we
 seeing


that
 this
 year
 as
 well
 in
 countries
 such


as
 France
 where
 the
 budget
 deficit
 is


now
 at
 6%
 of
 GDP
 and
 the
 French


government
 is
 now
 being
 forced
 to
 uh


address
 it
 in
 some
 way
 and
 and
 this
 is
 a


Playbook
 we've
 seen
 in
 so
 many
 Emerging


Markets
 you
 know
 from
 Brazil
 to
 Turkey


to
 so
 many
 other
 Emerging
 Markets


Frontier
 markets
 where
 the
 bond
 market


has
 said
 listen
 this
 is
 far
 gone
 far
 too


much
 uh
 we
 can't
 do
 this
 if
 if
 I
 told


you
 that
 uh
 without
 naming
 America
 that


there's
 a
 country
 in
 the
 world
 today


running
 a
 budget
 deficit
 which
 is
 6
 to


7%
 of
 GDP
 its
 debt
 to
 GDP
 government


debt
 to
 GDP
 is
 now
 over
 100%
 and
 is


going
 to
 be
 the
 second
 highest
 in
 the


developed
 World
 After
 Japan
 by
 the
 end


of
 of
 this
 decade
 you
 would
 say
 that
 hey


this
 is
 really
 problematic
 but
 in


America's
 case
 because
 this
 entire


deficit
 today
 is
 uh
 leading
 to
 higher


economic
 growth
 uh
 and
 you
 have
 this


incredible
 Rush
 of
 capital
 Coming
 to


America
 because
 of
 the
 boom
 that
 you're


seeing
 in
 technology
 and
 like
 AI
 these


uh
 problems
 are
 being
 glossed
 over
 what


is
 a
 trust
 moment
 the
 list
 trust
 moment


is
 when
 the
 market
 basically
 says
 okay


we
 cannot
 fund
 this
 we
 want
 hire
 and


higher
 interest
 rates
 to
 do
 this
 unless


you
 start
 cutting
 spending
 so
 this
 is


what
 happened
 in
 the
 UK
 right
 yes
 and


remind
 us
 what
 happened
 with
 interest


rates
 in
 the
 UK
 yeah
 trust
 announces


yeah
 so
 interest
 rates
 sort
 of
 you
 know


spiked
 up
 the
 currency
 uh
 declines


because
 generally
 like
 in
 America
 and


all
 we
 used
 to
 that
 when
 interest
 rates


go
 up
 you
 expect
 the
 currency
 to


strengthen
 so
 a
 tell
 sign
 that
 something


is
 going
 wrong
 is
 when
 interest
 rates
 go


up
 but
 the
 currency
 declines
 doesn't
 go


up
 that
 is
 always
 a
 Telltale
 sign
 that


the
 market
 is
 now
 saying
 enough
 is


enough
 and
 foreign
 investors
 are
 uh


retreating
 so
 the
 country
 you
 uh
 talked


about
 without
 talking
 about
 uh
 they
 are


seeing
 interest
 rates
 going
 up
 but
 also


the
 currency
 going
 up
 in
 the
 US
 today


interest
 rates
 have
 gone
 up
 even
 after


the
 Trump
 uh
 election
 interest
 rates


have
 gone
 up
 but
 the
 currency
 is
 also


gone
 up
 so
 that
 shows
 that
 there
 is
 no


sign
 as
 yet
 of
 any
 big
 concern
 but
 my


fear
 is
 that
 these
 things
 can
 turn
 very


quickly
 next
 year
 the
 you
 know
 when
 the


budget
 deficit
 in
 America
 begins
 to
 hit


7%
 imagine
 what
 happens
 in
 America
 if


there's
 an
 economic
 slowdown
 then
 the


budget
 deficit
 gets
 to
 8
 to
 9%
 of
 GDP


because
 if
 you
 have
 a
 Slowdown
 then
 the


revenue
 slow
 down
 spending
 automatically


goes
 up
 so
 we're
 getting
 to
 levels
 which


are
 uh
 completely
 egregious
 and
 I
 think


that
 investors
 are
 being
 misled
 because


a
 lot
 of
 this
 deficit
 today
 is


artificially
 funding
 the
 growth
 so
 the


economic
 growth
 in
 America
 looks
 pretty


good
 and
 you
 think
 that
 what's
 the


problem
 but
 I
 think
 that
 because
 it's


being
 funded
 by
 the
 deficit
 because


usually
 in
 the
 past
 when
 America
 has


been
 at
 this
 stage
 of
 the
 economic
 cycle


where
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 has
 been


this
 low
 the
 budget
 deficit
 has


historically
 been
 only
 1
 or
 2%
 of
 GDP


today
 you
 have
 full
 employment
 virtually


in
 America
 and
 a
 deficit
 of
 6
 to
 7%
 of


GDP
 so
 this
 is
 I
 think
 uh
 an


unsustainable
 situation
 Ria
 what's
 the


score
 in
 Europe
 Europe
 is
 in
 much
 worse


shape
 you
 know
 than
 America
 so
 as
 I


argue
 in
 the
 book
 that
 capitalism
 is
 in


worse
 shape
 in
 is
 bad
 well
 no
 um
 not


everywhere
 else
 but
 core
 Europe
 at
 least


because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 France
 Germany


productivity
 growth
 is
 much
 lower
 than


than
 even
 America
 in
 America
 too


productivity
 growth
 has
 been
 declining


for
 the
 last
 30
 to
 40
 years
 but
 in


Europe
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 why
 is
 this
 the


case
 because
 as
 somebody
 said
 that


Europe
 is
 really
 the
 Silicon
 value
 of


Regulation
 uh
 like
 in
 America
 as
 we
 know


that
 they're
 trying
 to
 now
 uh
 go
 after


too
 much
 regulation
 we
 know
 that


regulation
 has
 been
 a
 big
 burden
 on


small
 to
 midsize
 businesses
 in
 Europe


the
 regulatory
 burden
 is
 far
 higher


similarly
 like
 in
 Europe
 government


spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 is
 far
 higher


the
 deficits
 may
 not
 be
 but
 government


spending
 is
 so
 you're
 forced
 to
 tax
 much


more
 and
 in
 countries
 like
 France


government
 spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 is


nearly
 60%
 how
 do
 you
 call
 that
 a


capitalist
 Society
 When
 government


spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 is
 60%
 of
 the


economy
 second
 possibly
 highest
 in
 the


world
 after
 North
 Korea
 that
 is
 not
 a


capitalist
 Society
 anymore
 now
 IMF
 the


international
 monetary
 F
 uh
 have
 added


together
 all
 the
 the
 debt
 in
 the
 world


they
 get
 to
 roughly
 $100


trillion
 is
 that
 a
 problem
 well
 I
 think


that
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 total
 debt


levels
 is
 not
 uh
 like
 the
 issue
 for
 me


because
 in
 fact
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 work


on
 this
 that
 what
 when
 is
 debt
 a
 problem


and
 here's
 you
 know
 what
 I
 I
 found
 and


something
 I've
 written
 about
 in
 my


previous
 books
 that
 typically
 it's
 not


the
 level
 of
 debt
 which
 matters
 but
 it's


the
 pace
 of
 acceleration
 because
 if
 you


uh
 extend
 too
 much
 debt
 over
 a
 short
 uh


span
 of
 time
 uh
 often
 end
 up
 making
 bad


loans
 and
 so
 the
 typical
 sequence
 which


happens
 is
 that
 the
 private
 sector
 makes


uh
 those
 mistakes
 which
 is
 that
 you
 see


a
 big
 lending
 boom
 which
 takes
 place


which
 is
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 America
 and
 in


Europe
 in
 the
 2000s
 uh
 it
 was
 mainly


into
 the
 housing
 markets
 and
 then
 be
 if


the
 pace
 of
 growth
 is
 very
 sharp
 over
 a


5-year
 time
 Horizon
 you
 end
 up
 making


lots
 of
 bad
 loans
 and
 then
 you
 end
 up


having
 a
 problem
 and
 the
 government
 debt


typically
 increases
 after
 the
 country


has
 hit
 a
 crisis
 point
 or
 the
 problem


then
 the
 government
 increases
 its
 debt


to
 bail
 out
 the
 private
 sector
 that's


been
 the
 usual
 sequence
 of
 events
 this


time
 what's
 happening
 currently
 is
 that


the
 private
 sector
 has
 not
 increased


debt
 that
 much
 in
 places
 like
 America
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 households
 even
 the


corporate
 sector
 the
 increase
 in
 debt


has
 not
 been
 that
 much
 but
 this
 time
 the


unusual
 thing
 has
 been
 that
 the


government
 which
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 the


lender
 of
 Last
 Resort
 that
 is
 where
 the


debt
 has
 gone
 up
 exponentially
 and
 so


now
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 if
 you
 get
 in


trouble
 where
 the
 government
 uh
 debt


becomes
 an
 issue
 you
 have
 no
 lender
 of


Last
 Resort
 left
 because
 the
 government


was
 supposed
 to
 be
 the
 lender
 of
 of
 Last


Resort
 and
 that's
 where
 the
 debt
 has


gone
 up
 now
 you
 have
 some
 bold


perspectives
 on
 capitalism
 in
 your
 book


is
 that
 something
 that's
 been
 kind
 of


brewing
 in
 your
 mind
 for
 a
 long
 time
 or


was
 it
 a
 particular
 moment
 there
 we


triggered
 it
 well
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you


know
 like
 I've
 been
 a
 writer
 for
 a
 long


period
 of
 time
 I've
 been
 a
 I've
 been


writing
 since
 the
 age
 of
 17
 so
 these
 are


thoughts
 which
 keep
 building
 over
 time


and
 the
 book
 is
 a
 accumulation
 of
 that


thought
 process
 but
 I
 would
 say
 that
 for


me
 the
 moment
 was
 during
 the
 pandemic


that
 during
 the
 pandemic
 when
 I
 saw
 what


governments
 did
 which
 is
 that
 to
 shut


everything
 down
 and
 then
 to
 say
 that
 we


will
 just
 give
 massive
 amounts
 of


stimulus
 and
 you
 can
 sit
 home
 and
 and
 in


terms
 of
 it
 it
 does
 not
 matter
 and
 then


that
 stimulus
 is
 what
 led
 to
 this
 huge


amount
 of
 asset
 price
 inflation
 where
 in


2020
 the
 number
 of
 new
 billionaires


which
 were
 minted
 by
 people
 sitting
 at


at
 home
 was
 incredible
 because
 because


stock
 markets
 went
 up
 asset
 prices
 went


up
 that's
 when
 the
 real
 thought
 came
 up


what's
 gone
 wrong
 with
 capitalism
 that


this
 is
 not
 how
 it's
 supposed
 to


function
 where
 you
 give
 people
 free


money
 and
 especially
 the
 rich
 and
 the


privilege
 sitting
 home
 uh
 earning
 more


than
 $100,000
 a
 day
 are
 getting
 checks


or
 tax
 credits
 uh
 that's
 not
 how


capitalism
 is
 supposed
 to
 function


what's
 the
 biggest
 difference
 between


how
 it's
 supposed
 to
 function
 and
 how


you
 believe
 is
 functioning
 now
 right
 so


one
 thing
 I
 believe
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 uh


you
 know
 as
 someone
 put
 it
 very
 suly


which
 is
 that
 capitalism
 without


bankruptcy
 is
 like
 Christianity
 without


hell
 which
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 if
 you
 have


capitalism
 then
 you
 have
 to
 accept
 risk


as
 well
 you
 cannot
 have
 a
 system
 like


you
 have
 today
 where
 risk
 has
 been


socialized
 where
 the
 you
 know
 where
 the


governments
 are
 telling
 you
 on
 the


upside
 you
 can
 make
 as
 much
 money
 as
 you


want
 fine
 we
 will
 tax
 it
 you
 know
 when


we
 have
 to
 but
 you
 can
 make
 all
 the


money
 on
 the
 downside
 we
 are
 here
 to


protect
 you
 so
 this
 is
 what
 you
 call
 the


bailout
 culture
 that's
 right
 okay
 tell


us
 about
 it
 what
 when
 did
 they
 start
 uh


this
 is
 relatively
 new
 Nikolai
 because


if
 you
 look
 at
 even
 America
 right
 up


until
 the
 1970s
 America
 believed
 that


private
 sector
 companies
 are
 not
 meant


to
 be
 bailed
 out
 and
 then
 when
 the
 first


attempts
 at
 bailout
 happened
 in
 the


1970s
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 resistance
 uh


uh
 in
 in
 uh
 Washington
 uh
 in
 Congress
 at


the
 city
 state
 levels
 any
 talk
 of


bailing
 out
 private
 sector
 companies
 was


met
 with
 Fierce
 amount
 of
 resistance
 but


isn't
 it
 quite
 perfect
 I
 get
 the
 upside


and
 if
 it
 goes
 wrong
 somebody
 bails
 me


out
 yeah
 but
 that's
 what
 leads
 to


problems
 also
 because
 that's
 where
 you


end
 up
 having
 so
 many
 inefficient


companies
 that
 stay
 alive
 because
 of


that
 asymmetry
 and
 then
 it
 prevents
 new


companies
 from
 entering
 prevents
 new


entrance
 uh
 from
 um
 entering
 the
 system


and
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 what
 really


happened
 that
 in
 1984
 was
 a
 landmark


moment
 because
 that
 was
 the
 first
 major


bailout
 of
 a
 financial
 institution
 in


America
 that
 was
 the
 the
 Continental


Illinois
 Bank
 and
 once
 that
 happened


then
 every
 time
 there's
 been
 any
 problem


in
 the
 financial
 system
 the
 government's


been
 there
 to
 bail
 out
 and
 the
 most


ridiculous
 situation
 was
 last
 year
 where


you
 had
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 bailout


which
 is
 that
 it
 was
 a
 midsize
 Bank
 of


relatively
 ra
 uh
 rich
 depositors
 and
 uh


the
 depositors
 were
 all
 bailed
 out
 and


so
 now
 you
 have
 the
 implicit
 assumption


that
 at
 any
 Bank
 if
 you
 put
 money
 uh
 the


government's
 there
 to
 protect
 your


deposit
 so
 originally
 this
 was
 called


the
 green
 span
 put
 right
 cuz
 he
 was
 a


central
 Banker
 when
 it
 happens
 at
 the


first
 time
 but
 what
 are
 the
 implications


of
 this
 happening
 again
 yes
 the
 green


span
 put's
 a
 bit
 different
 so
 we
 spoke


about
 the
 bailout
 culture
 of
 Continental


like
 Illinois
 the
 greenpan
 put
 was
 also


very
 significant
 and
 this
 is
 the
 irony


of
 it
 we
 associate
 the
 1980s
 with
 this


Golden
 Era
 of
 free
 markets
 and


capitalism
 being
 Unleashed
 by
 Reagan
 and


Thatcher
 and
 stuff
 that's
 the
 popular


image
 and
 yet
 a
 couple
 of
 landmark


moments
 which
 totally
 distorted


capitalism
 happened
 in
 the
 1980s
 we


spoke
 spoke
 about
 the
 bailout
 of


Continental
 Illinois
 in
 1984
 which
 was
 a


landmark
 as
 the
 first
 major
 bailout
 of
 a


financial
 institution
 in
 post
 World
 War


II
 history
 and
 then
 in
 1987
 for
 the


first
 time
 when
 the
 stock
 market
 crashed


the
 Central
 Bank
 explicitly
 cut
 interest


rates
 and
 intervened
 to
 prop
 up
 the


stock
 market
 and
 that
 created
 this


feeling
 of
 a
 green
 span
 put
 which
 is


that
 once
 again
 on
 like
 on
 the
 upside


the
 policy
 makers
 say
 we
 don't
 know
 how


to
 predict
 bubbles
 or
 when
 markets


become
 too
 expensive
 so
 we'll
 do
 nothing


about
 it
 on
 the
 downside
 if
 something


happens
 we
 are
 here
 to
 clean
 up
 the
 mess


so
 um
 you
 say
 that
 we
 become
 addictive


to
 these
 type
 of
 help
 support
 bailouts


right
 yeah
 now
 how
 do
 you
 win
 markets


off
 it
 well
 it's
 very
 difficult
 but
 I'd


say
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 that's
 what
 I
 said


you
 know
 that
 that
 for
 any
 incoming


president
 or
 something
 it's
 to
 make
 it


very
 clear
 that
 we
 do
 not
 believe
 in
 a


bailout
 culture
 uh
 in
 terms
 and
 how
 do


you
 show
 that
 by
 letting
 something
 go


bus
 no
 by
 by
 s
 it
 uh
 preventively
 before


in
 good
 times
 because
 once
 you
 have
 a


crisis
 it
 becomes
 very
 difficult
 because


once
 you
 have
 a
 crisis
 then
 everyone


scrambling
 to
 find
 a
 solution
 but
 if
 you


make
 it
 clear
 to
 the
 outset
 that
 this
 is


not
 the
 culture
 we
 believe
 in
 and


remember
 you
 know
 this
 is
 what
 I
 find


like
 the
 great
 irony
 of
 it
 that
 usually


we
 say
 populism
 and
 an
 economic
 populism


is
 bad
 economics
 that
 you
 know
 populism


is
 supposed
 to
 be
 spending
 giveaways
 and


stuff
 like
 that
 but
 here
 is
 one
 populist


measure
 which
 I
 think
 is
 good
 economic


ICS
 if
 you
 say
 no
 bailouts
 because


bailouts
 remember
 are
 very
 unpopular


with
 the
 average
 person
 the
 2008


bailouts
 you
 can
 argue
 that
 they
 were


required
 of
 the
 banking
 system
 they
 were


very
 unpopular
 with
 the
 average
 American


they
 were
 because
 they
 saw
 their
 small


Community
 Banks
 fail
 and
 yet
 they
 saw


these
 large
 Banks
 getting
 bailouts
 and


that
 I
 think
 SED
 the
 seeds
 for
 so
 much


of
 the
 anti-establishment
 feeling
 the


anger
 that
 we
 have
 today
 so
 I
 think
 that


that's
 one
 of
 the
 solutions
 out
 here
 but


there
 are
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 solutions


that
 I
 offer
 in
 the
 book
 as
 to
 what
 can


be
 done
 to
 try
 and
 correct
 this
 system


where
 the
 average
 American
 or
 the


average
 person
 in
 Western
 societies


feels
 that
 the
 economic
 system
 is
 not


working
 for
 them
 first
 step
 is
 to


recognize
 this
 what
 I
 find
 shocking
 even


in
 America
 is
 that
 you
 know
 like
 in


terms
 of
 the
 number
 of
 people
 who
 are
 in


denial
 to
 say
 the
 oh
 the
 economy
 is


doing
 fine
 we're
 growing
 at
 2
 and
 a


half%
 what's
 the
 problem
 in
 terms
 of


that
 no
 no
 we're
 growing
 at
 2
 and
 a


half%
 but
 that's
 at
 the
 headline
 level


look
 beneath
 the
 hood
 the
 number
 of


people
 who
 are
 dissatisfied
 with
 the


economic
 system
 is
 staggering
 there
 are


70%
 of
 Americans
 say
 they
 want
 the


economic
 system
 to
 be
 torn
 down
 and
 the


country
 is
 moving
 in
 the
 wrong
 economic


Direction
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 very


important
 factor
 even
 in
 this
 election


and
 a
 very
 important
 reason
 why
 in
 the


last
 uh
 uh
 three
 elections
 for
 example


here
 in
 the
 US
 the
 incumbent
 party
 in


the
 white
 house
 has
 lost
 the
 election


that's
 never
 happened
 before
 uh
 or
 at


least
 not
 happened
 before
 in
 the
 last


you
 know
 150
 years
 that
 I
 know
 you
 say


that
 capitalism
 in
 Europe
 is


dysfunctional
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that


that
 I
 mean
 like
 in
 Europe
 as
 I
 said


that
 if
 we
 talk
 about
 problems
 in


America
 of
 overregulation
 over
 uh


spending
 and
 too
 much
 of
 a
 uh
 welfarist


Society
 then
 in
 Europe
 those
 problems


are
 even
 greater
 and
 you
 think
 America


is
 going
 in
 the
 same
 direction
 exactly


so
 that's
 what's
 happening
 which
 is
 if


you
 look
 at
 welfare
 spending
 as
 a
 share


of
 GDP
 America
 is
 very
 quickly
 catching


up
 with
 Europe
 now
 and
 I'm
 talking
 about


core
 Europe
 as
 I
 say
 like
 in
 Europe
 also


we
 have
 to
 make
 distinctions
 that
 there


is
 core
 Europe
 uh
 which
 is
 the
 France


Germany
 of
 the
 world
 but
 then
 there
 are


some
 good
 examples
 in
 Europe
 too
 one
 of


the
 countries
 I
 speak
 about
 are


countries
 like
 Switzerland
 where
 I
 say


that
 here
 you
 know
 like
 it's
 the
 richest


country
 in
 the
 world
 it
 is
 among
 the
 20


largest
 economies
 and
 they
 seem
 to
 get


the
 balance
 much
 correct
 in
 terms
 of


their
 spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 there


is
 no
 utopian
 Nation
 but
 uh
 they
 get
 the


balance
 correct
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 and


you
 know
 this
 even
 in
 places
 like


Scandinavia
 and
 staff
 that
 that
 places


like
 Sweden
 and
 all
 that
 that
 when
 they


became
 very
 overextended
 in
 the
 1990s


and
 they
 faced
 a
 crisis
 even
 they
 were


forced
 to
 pull
 back
 their
 government


spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 had
 reached


70%
 and
 stuff
 in
 the
 early
 1990s
 and


they
 reached
 a
 crisis
 and
 then
 the
 good


thing
 is
 that
 these
 countries
 uh
 are


much
 more
 fiscally
 disciplined
 today


compared
 to
 let's
 say
 America
 so
 do
 you


think
 the
 countries
 in
 Europe
 will
 start


to
 pull
 back
 on
 government
 spending
 well


I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 start


to
 pull
 back
 but
 you
 know
 like
 on


government
 spending
 because
 very
 few
 do


it
 until
 they
 face
 a
 crisis
 what
 do
 you


think
 will
 cause
 the
 crisis
 the
 bond


market
 that
 you
 know
 when
 the
 bond


market
 revolts
 we
 saw
 that
 in
 UK
 we
 and


we're
 seeing
 some
 signs
 of
 that
 in


France
 this
 year
 so
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the


only
 way
 is
 when
 the
 market
 says
 enough


is
 enough
 we
 cannot
 fund
 these
 deficits


we
 can't
 fund
 this
 spending
 anymore
 and


Emerging
 Markets
 have
 seen
 that
 all
 the


time
 which
 is
 that
 you
 know
 that
 the


markets
 say
 we
 just
 can't
 fund
 this
 it


happened
 to
 Greece
 too
 in
 fact
 the
 the


poster
 child
 of
 an
 economic
 turnaround


story
 in
 Europe
 has
 been
 Greece
 that


Greece
 at
 this
 time
 last
 decade
 we
 were


all
 what
 it
 sick
 about
 Greece
 and
 the


crisis
 in
 Greece
 they
 were
 forced
 to
 cut


back
 but
 but
 they
 faced
 a
 crisis
 the


problem
 is
 if
 you
 don't
 face
 a
 crisis


then
 you
 can
 keep
 on
 extending
 and


pretending
 that's
 what
 Japan
 has
 done


that's
 what
 Italy
 has
 done
 so
 it's


almost
 sometimes
 better
 to
 have
 a
 crisis


to
 force
 change
 because
 then
 the
 society


the
 people
 understand
 the
 reason
 for


cutting
 back
 and
 for
 change
 if
 you
 don't


have
 an
 outright
 crisis
 even
 if
 the


problem
 is
 Insidious
 in
 nature
 there
 is


no
 incentive
 to
 cut
 it
 back
 and
 I
 think


that
 that's
 where
 we
 stand
 today
 with


many
 Western
 societies
 with
 the


increased
 public
 sector
 um
 activity
 in


many
 countries
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 productivity
 in
 those
 countries
 well


as
 I
 said
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at


productivity
 growth
 and
 this
 is
 the


great
 Paradox
 right
 which
 is
 that


productivity
 growth
 in
 the
 last
 30
 to
 40


years
 has
 been
 declining
 even
 though


we've
 had
 some
 incredible
 technology


booms
 through
 it
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that


the
 only
 way
 that
 you
 can
 explain
 it
 is


that
 because
 you've
 had
 this
 increased


role
 of
 government
 in
 the
 last
 30
 to
 40


years
 because
 productivity
 growth
 should


be
 going
 up
 on
 the
 back
 of
 the
 tech
 boom


and
 except
 for
 a
 brief
 period
 in
 the


late
 1990s
 and
 and
 early
 2000s
 when
 you


had
 the
 tech
 boom
 and
 you
 saw
 big


increase
 in
 productivity
 yeah
 um


otherwise
 productivity
 has
 been


declining
 now
 um
 after
 the
 pandemic


we've
 seen
 some
 increase
 in
 productivity


in
 places
 like
 the
 United
 States
 but


that
 could
 be
 because
 you
 got
 some
 churn


out
 there
 where
 where
 old
 businesses


were
 some
 shut
 down
 some
 new
 ones
 began


but
 the
 trend
 has
 been
 down
 for
 the
 last


30
 to
 40
 years
 the
 Paradox
 is
 why
 do
 we


have
 a
 decline
 in
 productivity
 in
 the


midst
 of
 this
 incredible
 Tech
 boom
 and


the
 only
 explanation
 that
 I
 can
 find
 uh


over
 this
 time
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 role


of
 the
 government
 has
 increased
 a
 lot
 it


has
 distorted
 capitalism
 that
 if
 you
 if


risk
 is
 being
 socialized
 then
 then
 you


will
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 Deadwood
 float
 up
 in


the
 system
 and
 one
 of
 the
 big
 themes
 I


speak
 about
 as
 well
 in
 the
 book
 as
 well


is
 the
 concept
 of
 zombie
 companies
 and
 I


think
 this
 is
 fascinating
 which
 is
 that


you
 know
 uh
 this
 term
 zombie
 companies


first
 became
 popular
 in
 Japan
 and
 the


1990s
 uh
 when
 um
 and
 if
 you
 read
 the


Western
 press
 then
 or
 of
 even
 the


American
 Press
 and
 staff
 they
 would


almost
 be
 scornful
 that
 you
 know
 these


zombie
 companies
 which
 are
 defined
 as


companies
 that
 don't
 even
 make
 enough


profit
 to
 cover
 their
 interest
 expenses


for
 three
 years
 in
 a
 row
 that
 these


companies
 exist
 in
 places
 like
 Japan


it's
 not
 in
 in
 in
 like
 America
 they


don't
 exist
 now
 in
 the
 1990s
 zombie


companies
 were
 roughly
 2%
 of
 the
 total


amount
 of
 listed
 companies
 in
 places


like
 America
 today
 by
 some
 estimates


such
 as
 the
 bis
 the
 number
 of
 zombie


companies
 is
 close
 to
 20%
 of
 the
 total


number
 of
 listed
 companies
 in
 places


like
 America
 why
 has
 that
 happened


that's
 because
 you've
 kept
 so
 much


Deadwood
 alive
 in
 the
 system
 because
 of


easy
 money
 bailouts
 that
 and
 if
 you
 have


so
 many
 zombie
 companies
 it
 only
 stands


to
 reason
 that
 it'll
 be
 much
 more


inefficient
 now
 so
 if
 you
 could
 make


some
 changes
 to
 put
 capitalism
 on
 a


better
 path
 what
 would
 you
 do
 well
 I'd


say
 that
 what's
 practical
 and
 what's


practical
 right
 so
 cutting
 spending


welfare
 and
 all
 is
 Not
 Practical
 it's


not
 going
 to
 happen
 so
 let's
 not
 even
 go


down
 that
 path
 what
 are
 the
 three
 to


four
 practical
 suggestions
 that
 anyone


can
 do
 uh
 to
 to
 try
 and
 do
 that
 so
 I
 do


think
 that
 deregulation
 is
 a
 very
 big


step
 because
 the
 people
 who
 are
 hurt
 the


most
 by
 regulation
 tend
 to
 be
 the
 small


and
 midsize
 businesses
 and
 that's
 where


confidence
 today
 is
 really
 low
 the
 large


companies
 they're
 able
 to
 uh
 they
 almost


like
 regulation
 because
 they
 they're


able
 to
 uh
 afford
 it
 and
 they're
 able
 to


also
 write
 regulations
 in
 the
 way
 which


favor
 them
 because
 they
 have
 all
 the


lobbyists
 uh
 in
 the
 capital
 city
 such
 as


Washington
 so
 deregulation
 is
 very


important
 the
 second
 thing
 I
 think
 which


is
 very
 important
 is
 that
 if
 you
 if
 I


were
 to
 say
 what's
 the
 leading
 symbol
 of


what
 went
 wrong
 with
 capitalism
 it
 is


housing
 prices
 that
 in
 places
 like


America
 it
 is
 unaffordable
 to
 buy
 a
 new


home
 uh
 the
 number
 of
 20
 year
 olds
 who


are
 living
 in
 with
 their
 parents
 today


is
 more
 than
 50%
 the
 number
 of
 Americans


who
 say
 today
 that
 you
 know
 that
 they'll


not
 be
 able
 to
 realize
 their
 so-called


American
 dream
 of
 having
 their
 own
 home


is
 staggeringly
 high
 so
 home
 prices
 have


gone
 up
 a
 lot
 and
 one
 of
 the
 big
 reasons


home
 prices
 have
 gone
 up
 a
 lot
 is


because
 uh
 you
 have
 so
 much
 amount
 of


Regulation
 that
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to


build
 new
 homes
 now
 and
 so
 Supply
 is


very
 short
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 if
 you
 have


very
 easy
 interest
 rates
 then
 the
 demand


is
 very
 high
 for
 for
 for
 home
 so
 you
 got


this
 massive
 mismatch
 so
 I
 think


focusing
 on
 making
 homes
 affordable


again
 has
 to
 be
 a
 central
 issue
 for


capitalism
 whether
 it's
 got
 to
 do
 with


improving
 zoning
 coding
 laws
 the
 culture


of
 nimbyism
 that's
 that's
 something
 else


which
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 and
 I
 think
 that


the
 other
 thing
 also
 as
 I
 say
 is
 that


this
 culture
 of
 bailouts
 needs
 to
 end


that
 you
 know
 and
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 done


preemptively
 you
 can't
 do
 it
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 crisis
 but
 in
 the
 middle
 of


an
 expansion
 for
 you
 know
 like
 you
 know


for
 the
 leaders
 to
 say
 that
 we
 you
 the


private
 sector
 companies
 get
 in
 trouble


you
 guys
 need
 to
 sort
 this
 out
 on
 your


own
 don't
 expect
 us
 to
 come
 and
 bail
 you


out
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the
 basic
 steps


which
 can
 be
 taken
 I
 think
 to
 try
 and
 uh


right
 capitalism
 and
 also
 I
 think
 that


this
 whole
 idea
 of
 running
 deficits
 this


large
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 an
 economic


expansion
 you
 know
 like
 what's
 the


justification
 for
 doing
 it
 uh
 I
 think


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 worried
 about


you
 know
 what
 the
 debt
 situation
 is
 the


younger
 people
 it
 leads
 to
 geter


intergenerational
 tension
 they
 think


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 left
 with
 all


this
 debt
 uh
 to
 try
 and
 service
 at
 some


point
 in
 time
 so
 I
 think
 these
 are
 some


of
 the
 basic
 steps
 which
 need
 to
 be


taken
 to
 right
 capitalism
 rer
 this
 has


been
 great
 uh
 just
 an
 example
 of
 why
 it


is
 so
 incredibly
 interesting
 to
 live


today
 and
 to
 read
 the
 papers
 every
 day


see
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 economy
 and
 W


Times
 have
 just
 never
 been
 more


interesting
 big
 thanks
 thanks
