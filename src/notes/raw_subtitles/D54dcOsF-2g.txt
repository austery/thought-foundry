From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Monday,
 October
 13th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


This
 morning,
 Hamas
 released
 all
 of
 the


remaining
 living
 hostages
 held
 in
 Gaza.


In
 Israel,
 crowds
 gathered
 to
 cheer
 and


wave
 along
 a
 road
 leading
 to
 a
 military


base
 where
 some
 of
 the
 hostages
 were


transferred
 for
 initial
 checks
 and
 to
 be


reunited
 with
 their
 families.
 The
 20


hostages
 had
 been
 held
 since
 October


7th,
 2023,
 and
 they
 included
 Israeli


soldiers
 and
 people
 who
 had
 been


abducted
 from
 a
 music
 festival.
 Their


release
 is
 a
 crucial
 part
 of
 a
 ceasefire


deal
 that
 Israel
 and
 Hamas
 agreed
 to


last
 week.
 Hamas
 is
 also
 required
 to


return
 the
 remains
 of
 roughly
 two
 dozen


hostages
 who
 have
 died.
 though
 it's


unclear
 how
 quickly
 that
 will
 happen.


In
 exchange,
 today
 Israel
 began


releasing
 nearly
 2,000
 Palestinian


prisoners.
 Many
 were
 busted
 to
 the


Israeli
 occupied
 West
 Bank,
 where
 they


stepped
 off
 the
 bus
 into
 a
 cheering


crowd.
 Under
 the
 deal,
 Israel's
 also


partially
 pulled
 its
 troops
 back
 in
 Gaza


and
 started
 allowing
 more
 humanitarian


aid
 to
 flow
 into
 the
 territory.
 Earlier


today,
 President
 Trump,
 who
 helped


broker
 the
 agreement
 between
 Hamas
 and


Israel,
 landed
 in
 Tel
 Aviv
 to
 meet
 with


hostages
 families
 and
 deliver
 a
 speech


to
 the
 Israeli
 parliament.
 In
 the


audience,
 some
 people
 are
 wearing
 hats


that
 say
 Trump
 the
 peace
 president.
 You


can
 follow
 live
 coverage
 of
 Trump's


remarks
 at
 ny
 times.com.


After
 he's
 done
 speaking,
 Trump
 is


expected
 to
 fly
 to
 Egypt
 for
 a
 summit
 on


what
 will
 happen
 next
 in
 Gaza
 and
 the


wider
 region.
 The
 Egyptian
 president's


office
 said
 the
 goal
 was
 to
 usher
 in


quote
 a
 new
 phase
 of
 regional
 security


and
 stability.
 As
 multiple
 world
 leaders


gather
 for
 the
 summit,
 it
 remains


unclear
 if
 the
 ceasefire
 between
 Israel


and
 Hamas
 will
 hold
 and
 become


permanent.
 Two
 major
 sticking
 points
 in


negotiations,
 whether
 Hamas
 will
 disarm,


and
 whether
 it
 will
 agree
 that
 it
 can
 no


longer
 rule
 Gaza
 are
 still
 unresolved.

It's
 day
 13
 of
 the
 government
 shutdown


and
 across
 the
 country
 more
 and
 more


Americans
 are
 beginning
 to
 feel
 the


impact.
 In
 some
 Native
 American


communities,
 key
 medical
 services
 like


diabetes
 monitoring
 have
 been
 cancelled.


Veterans
 have
 seen
 regional
 benefits


offices
 close.
 And
 many
 of
 the
 country's


fruit
 and
 vegetable
 farmers
 don't
 have


access
 to
 crucial
 information
 about
 what


government
 programs
 they'll
 be
 able
 to


rely
 on
 as
 they
 plan
 for
 next
 year's


crops.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 many
 federal


workers
 got
 what
 will
 be
 their
 last


paychecks
 on
 Friday
 until
 the
 government


reopens.
 And
 thousands
 of
 other


government
 workers
 have
 lost
 their
 jobs


altogether.


Can
 you
 assess
 how
 significant
 these
 job


cuts
 will
 be?


Well,
 the
 longer
 it
 goes
 on,
 the
 more


significant
 they're
 going
 to
 be.
 And
 to


be
 clear,
 some
 of
 these
 cuts
 are
 going


to
 be
 painful.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 a
 situation


that
 we
 relish.
 This
 is
 not
 something


that
 we're
 looking
 forward
 to.


On
 Friday,
 the
 White
 House
 began


following
 through
 on
 its
 threat
 to
 use


the
 shutdown
 to
 fire
 federal
 workers,


eliminating
 more
 than
 4,000
 positions


across
 multiple
 agencies,
 including
 the


departments
 of
 the
 Treasury
 and
 Health


and
 Human
 Services.
 The
 process
 has
 been


somewhat
 chaotic,
 though.
 On
 Friday


night,
 the
 administration
 mistakenly


fired
 hundreds
 of
 scientists
 at
 the
 CDC,


some
 of
 whom
 specialized
 in
 measles
 and


Ebola
 outbreaks.
 The
 administration
 then


spent
 the
 weekend
 scrambling
 to
 bring


some
 of
 them
 back.
 At
 the
 moment,


lawmakers
 remain
 deadlocked
 over
 any


effort
 to
 reopen
 the
 government.


Republicans
 need
 at
 least
 some


Democratic
 support
 to
 pass
 their


proposed
 temporary
 spending
 bill,
 but


Democrats
 say
 they're
 holding
 out
 for


concessions
 on
 healthcare
 funding.

A
 red
 start
 is
 what
 Hangen
 has
 seen.


Taiwan
 index
 is
 down
 2%
 as
 well
 as


this
 morning.
 Stocks
 across
 Asia


dropped.


One
 of
 the
 toughest
 days
 on
 Wall
 Street


in
 months.


The
 slide
 follows
 a
 big
 drop
 in
 stocks


in
 the
 US
 on
 Friday.
 Investors
 are
 on


edge
 after
 President
 Trump
 threatened
 a


massive
 new
 wave
 of
 tariffs
 on
 Chinese


goods,
 sparking
 fears
 that
 the
 two


countries
 could
 reignite
 the
 trade
 war


that
 flared
 up
 this
 spring.
 The
 new


tension
 started
 when
 China
 said
 last


week
 that
 it
 was
 tightening
 its
 grip


over
 rare
 earth
 metals,
 requiring


companies
 to
 get
 new
 licenses
 to
 ship


them
 out
 of
 the
 country.
 Those
 minerals


are
 crucial
 for
 making
 computer
 chips


and
 batteries,
 and
 China
 dominates


production
 of
 them.
 Its
 factories


process
 roughly
 90%
 of
 the
 global


supply.
 For
 example,
 it's
 the
 only
 place


in
 the
 world
 that
 refineses
 Samarium,
 a


material
 used
 in
 American
 F-35
 fighter


jets
 and
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 missiles.
 Trump


denounced
 China's
 move
 as
 sinister
 and


hostile,
 and
 said
 the
 US
 will
 put
 a
 100%


tariff
 on
 all
 products
 from
 China.


That's
 on
 top
 of
 existing
 sir
 charges


that
 he's
 imposed
 of
 at least
 30%.
 He


also
 threatened
 to
 call
 off
 the


in-person
 talks
 he
 scheduled
 to
 have


this
 month
 with
 the
 Chinese
 president
 on


the
 sidelines
 of
 an
 economic
 conference


in
 South
 Korea.
 Meanwhile,
 despite
 the


tensions
 over
 trade,
 there
 was
 a
 little


breakthrough
 in
 US
 China
 relations
 this


past
 week
 in
 basketball.


For
 years,
 the
 NBA
 has
 had
 a
 massive
 fan


base
 in
 China.
 By
 some
 estimates,
 at


peak
 viewership,
 more
 people
 watched
 the


NBA
 Finals
 in
 China
 than
 in
 the
 US.
 But


that
 all
 imploded
 in
 2019
 when
 a
 manager


for
 an
 NBA
 team
 posted
 on
 social
 media


that
 he
 supported
 pro-democracy
 protests


in
 Hong
 Kong.
 That
 infuriated
 Chinese


officials
 who
 pulled
 the
 NBA
 from


Chinese
 state
 TV.
 The
 controversy


exploded
 while
 two
 NBA
 teams
 were
 in


China
 set
 to
 play
 a
 pre-season
 game.
 The


players
 told
 the
 Times
 they
 saw
 the


outrage
 build
 in
 real
 time,
 watching


from
 their
 hotel
 rooms
 as
 workers
 ripped


down
 huge
 ads
 with
 their
 faces
 on
 them


from
 a
 nearby
 building.
 There
 have
 been


no
 NBA
 games
 in
 China
 or
 its
 territories


since
 then
 until
 this
 past
 Friday.


I
 mean,
 is
 this
 the
 most
 exciting
 live


shot
 I've
 ever
 done?
 We're
 a
 couple


hours
 away
 now
 from
 tip
 off.


The
 game
 between
 the
 Phoenix
 Suns
 and


the
 Brooklyn
 Nets
 happened
 in
 Macau.


This
 game
 is
 more
 than
 about
 basketball.


And
 it
 was
 the
 result
 of
 years
 of


negotiations
 by
 an
 American
 casino


mogul,
 Patrick
 Dumont,
 who
 operates
 a


location
 in
 Macau,
 too.
 Casino
 owners


there
 have
 been
 under
 pressure
 from
 the


Chinese
 government
 to
 diversify
 beyond


gambling
 or
 risk
 losing
 their
 license.


And
 so,
 Dumont
 hatched
 a
 plan
 to
 bring


the
 NBA
 back
 to
 Chinese
 audiences
 and
 to


play
 at
 his
 casino's
 arena
 in
 Macau.


Specifically,
 this
 weekend's
 games
 were


part
 of
 a
 multi-year
 plan
 for
 more.
 In


the
 past,
 other
 sports
 leagues,


including
 the
 English
 Premier
 League,


have
 had
 riffs
 with
 Beijing
 over


questions
 of
 human
 rights
 and
 other


controversies.
 In
 those
 cases,
 the


leagues
 have
 often
 made
 concessions
 to


the
 Chinese
 government
 to
 resolve


things.
 In
 the
 case
 of
 the
 NBA,
 the


league
 insists
 it
 made
 no
 concessions.


But
 in
 an
 interview
 with
 the
 Times,
 the


head
 of
 the
 NBA
 said
 that
 the
 league


would
 have
 to
 be
 flexible
 in
 its
 renewed


relationship
 with
 Beijing,
 saying,


quote,
 "If
 this
 is
 about
 ideological


purity
 on
 either
 side,
 it
 will
 never
 be


achieved."

And
 finally,
 today
 on
 the
 federal


calendar
 is
 Columbus
 Day.
 Post
 offices


are
 closed.
 A
 lot
 of
 banks
 are
 shut,
 but


across
 the
 country,
 more
 than
 a
 dozen


states
 and
 cities
 mark
 today
 as


Indigenous
 People's
 Day.
 There's
 been
 a


longtime
 push
 not
 to
 celebrate
 Columbus,


the
 Italian
 navigator
 who
 sailed
 to
 the


Americas
 in
 1492
 by
 people
 who
 point
 to


the
 violent
 colonization
 that
 followed


his
 arrival.
 In
 2020,
 statues
 of


Columbus
 became
 a
 flash
 point
 during


racial
 justice
 protests
 after
 the
 murder


of
 George
 Floyd.


That
 year,
 more
 than
 30
 were
 dismantled,


either
 by
 protesters
 or
 officials
 who


took
 them
 down.


5
 years
 later,
 the
 Times
 has
 been


looking
 at
 where
 those
 statues
 ended
 up.


Boston's
 Columbus
 statue,
 which
 was


beheaded,
 ended
 up
 being
 repaired
 and


relocated
 to
 a
 church
 garden.


Baltimore's
 was
 dumped
 in
 the
 harbor
 by


protesters,
 but
 the
 pieces
 have
 since


been
 fished
 out
 to
 be
 used
 to
 make
 a


replica.
 Other
 Columbus
 statues
 have


found
 new
 homes
 at
 museums
 or


Italian-American
 social
 clubs.


Italian-American
 groups
 have
 helped
 with


a
 lot
 of
 the
 restorations
 and


relocations.
 For
 them,
 Columbus
 is
 a


part
 of
 their
 heritage.
 A
 lot
 of


Columbus
 statues
 were
 originally
 put
 up


years
 ago
 as
 symbols
 of
 Italian
 pride
 at


a
 time
 when
 Italian
 immigrants
 faced


discrimination
 in
 the
 US.
 Meanwhile,


some
 cities
 have
 decided
 to
 put
 up
 new


statues
 altogether
 where
 Columbus
 used


to
 be.
 Newark,
 New
 Jersey
 put
 up
 a


monument
 to
 Harriet
 Tubman.
 San
 Antonio,


Texas,
 put
 up
 a
 statue
 of
 the
 patron


saint
 of
 seafarers.
 And
 in
 New
 Haven,


Connecticut,
 a
 bronze
 statue
 was


unveiled
 last
 year
 that
 depicts
 an


Italian
 immigrant
 family.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

 be
 back
