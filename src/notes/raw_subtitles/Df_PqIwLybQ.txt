This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 This
 is
 part
 two
 to
 the


video
 about
 the
 US
 tech
 hubs.
 Tech


cities
 today
 can
 be
 broken
 into
 three


types.
 High
 salaries,
 insane
 hustle


culture,
 and
 you
 live
 paycheck
 to


paycheck,
 mid
 salaries,
 okayish
 balance,


but
 taxes
 crush
 any
 real
 ambition.
 Mid


to
 low
 salaries,
 affordable
 living,
 but


social
 life
 is
 non-existent.
 In
 a
 world


where
 housing
 costs
 have
 spiraled
 out
 of


control,
 inflation
 eats
 your
 race
 before


it
 hits
 your
 bank
 account,
 where


geopolitical
 tensions
 reshape
 borders,


one
 question
 looms
 large.
 Where
 to
 run?


You
 can
 watch
 part
 one
 here.
 In
 this


video,
 we
 will
 be
 talking
 about
 less


popular
 locations
 in
 the
 United
 States


where
 life
 is
 a
 lot
 calmer,
 more


affordable,
 and
 where
 people
 simply
 have


different
 values
 than
 what
 you
 typically


find
 in
 California
 or
 New
 York.
 So,


let's
 start
 with
 Seattle,
 Washington.


Tech
 scene
 and
 culture.
 Seattle's
 tech


scene
 was
 built
 for
 engineers,
 and
 it


still
 shows.
 In
 2025,
 it
 remains
 a
 major


force
 in
 tech,
 but
 it's
 not
 as
 chaotic,


high
 velocity
 startup
 playground
 you


will
 find
 down
 in
 California.
 Seattle
 is


best
 known
 for
 big
 tech.
 Think
 Amazon,


Microsoft,
 Google,
 and
 Meta.
 All
 with


massive
 campuses,
 deep
 budgets,
 and


hundreds
 of
 product
 and
 engineering


teams.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 Seattle's


talent
 pool
 is
 top
 tier,
 but
 it's
 a


different
 flavor
 compared
 to
 NYC
 or
 San


Francisco.
 While
 San
 Francisco
 draws


wild
 startup
 founders
 with
 halfbaked
 AI


products,
 people
 who
 want
 to
 build
 the


next
 big
 thing
 and
 change
 the
 world,
 and


New
 York
 attracts
 hyper
 ambition


generalists
 from
 finance,
 consulting,


and
 legacy
 tech.
 Seattle
 is
 home
 to


deeply
 technical
 builders
 skilled
 in


stability
 and
 scale.
 It's
 very
 common
 to


come
 across
 people
 who
 have
 spent


decades
 optimizing
 distributed
 systems


at
 Amazon
 or
 perhaps
 shipping
 a
 core


infrastructure
 feature
 at
 Microsoft
 or


building
 a
 very
 specific
 messaging


platform
 and
 messaging
 infrastructure


for
 WhatsApp.
 The
 roles
 here
 are
 often


highly
 specialized.
 The
 average
 PM
 or


data
 scientist
 here
 is
 less
 about


networking
 meetups
 and
 more
 about


shipping
 clean,
 sustainable
 and
 dur


durable
 product.
 It's
 not
 as
 chaotic
 or


experimental
 as
 San
 Francisco
 or
 NYC.


But
 the
 execution
 discipline
 and


engineering
 collaboration
 in
 Seattle
 are


hard
 to
 beat,
 especially
 if
 you're


serious
 about
 learning
 how
 to
 build
 at


scale.
 The
 vibes
 less
 flashy,
 more


engineering
 driven.
 PMs
 here
 don't
 yell


pivot
 at
 every
 meetup.
 Data
 scientists


are
 not
 trying
 to
 reinvent
 the
 wheel.


There
 is
 a
 quiet
 confidence
 to
 how
 teams


build
 things.
 Companies
 in
 Seattle
 are


big
 on
 hierarchy.
 This
 isn't
 a
 flat
 work


sort
 of
 situation.
 You
 have
 to
 earn


those
 title
 bumps.
 But
 the
 upside
 is


career
 clarity.
 If
 you're
 sick
 of


startup
 chaos
 and
 want
 defined
 roles,


mentorship,
 and
 predictable
 career
 and


compensation,
 Seattle
 might
 be
 a
 perfect


place
 for
 you.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and


salaries.
 The
 salaries
 for
 mid
 to
 senior


product
 managers,
 data
 scientists,
 and


software
 engineers
 are
 still
 very


competitive.
 It's
 usually
 between
 160
 to


220
 depending
 on
 the
 company
 and
 level.


Big
 tech
 can
 push
 you
 towards
 250
 plus


when
 equity
 hits.
 The
 beautiful
 thing


about
 Washington
 state
 is
 the
 absence
 of


state
 income
 tax.
 That
 alone
 can
 save


you
 10
 to
 $20,000
 compared
 to
 California


or
 New
 York.
 Rent
 isn't
 cheap,
 but


manageable.
 Groceries
 and
 lifestyle


costs
 are
 highish,
 but
 still
 more


affordable
 than
 California.
 You
 won't


feel
 rich,
 but
 unlike
 NYC
 or
 California,


you
 can
 save,
 you
 can
 invest,
 and


perhaps
 even
 own
 something
 before
 you


turn
 60.
 Conclusion:
 At
 which
 stage
 of


your
 career
 is
 Seattle
 a
 good
 idea?
 When


is
 it
 worth
 it?
 You're
 a
 specialized


tech
 professional
 with
 deep
 expertise


who
 values
 a
 predictable
 career
 path,


strong
 compensation,
 and
 a
 balanced


life.
 You
 have
 no
 ambitions
 to
 build
 a


time
 machine.
 You're
 here
 to
 build
 a


solid
 system,
 grow
 steadily,
 and
 live


well.
 You
 prioritize
 well-being,
 nature,


and
 calmer
 pace
 over
 the
 adrenaline
 and


cutting
 edge
 moonshots.
 In
 Seattle,


working
 in
 tech
 often
 means
 a
 stable


income,
 real
 savings,
 generous
 vacation,


and
 actual
 time
 with
 your
 family.
 When


is
 it
 not
 worth
 it?
 If
 you
 get
 bored
 of


repetitive
 work
 and
 crave
 the
 thrill
 of


high
 stakes,
 innovation,
 and
 chasing
 the


next
 unicorn,
 you're
 looking
 for
 a
 go


hard,
 play
 hard
 sort
 of
 culture
 with


constant
 pressure,
 intensity,
 and
 the


chance
 to
 swing
 big
 and
 fast.
 Seattle


will
 likely
 be
 too
 slow,
 too


comfortable,
 and
 a
 little
 too
 stable.


Austin,
 Texas.
 Tech
 scene
 and
 culture.


Austin's
 tech
 ecosystem
 has
 evolved
 fast


over
 the
 past
 decade.
 It's
 no
 longer


just
 the
 IBM
 and
 Dell.
 Now
 you've
 got


the
 big
 tech,
 Oracle,
 Tesla,
 and
 a


growing
 wave
 of
 startups.
 Austin
 isn't


trying
 to
 be
 the
 next
 Silicon
 Valley.


And
 that's
 exactly
 why
 it
 works.
 It's
 a


launchpad
 city.
 You
 come
 here
 to
 build


lean,
 fast,
 and
 extend
 your
 runway.
 Cost


of
 living
 is
 still
 significantly
 lower


than
 San
 Francisco
 or
 NYC.
 There
 is
 no


state
 income
 tax
 and
 the
 local
 ecosystem


is
 packed
 with
 tech
 entrepreneurs
 who


have
 done
 it
 before.
 You
 will
 find
 a
 lot


of
 second-time
 founders,
 engineers


leaving
 the
 big
 tech
 and
 trying
 to
 build


something
 new
 and
 teams
 anchoring
 their


headquarters
 here
 to
 access
 talent


without
 burning
 through
 cash.
 It's


especially
 good
 for
 MVP
 stage
 products,


bootstrap
 ventures,
 and
 preede
 to
 series


A.
 Quality
 of
 talent.
 The
 talent


ecosystem
 is
 strong
 and
 growing.
 The


University
 of
 Texas
 at
 Austin
 produces


fantastic
 tech
 talent
 and
 the
 influx
 of


experienced
 professionals
 from
 coastal


tech
 hubs
 is
 elevating
 the
 talent
 pool


significantly.
 Plus
 the
 layoffs
 over
 the


past
 3
 years.
 People
 who
 were
 laid
 off


across
 the
 country
 and
 especially
 those


in
 the
 states
 with
 high
 cost
 of
 living


like
 California
 for
 example
 are
 now


considering
 to
 move
 down
 south.
 So


Austin
 is
 no
 longer
 a
 boring
 place
 in


Texas
 with
 some
 tech
 forums
 that
 only


locals
 want
 to
 work
 at.
 the
 vibes.
 I


know
 there
 is
 a
 saying,
 don't


California,
 my
 Texas.
 So,
 no
 offense
 to


any
 Texans
 listening
 to
 this,
 but
 I've


heard
 from
 people
 who
 remember
 the
 Bay


Area
 back
 in
 early
 2000s
 and
 some
 of


them
 are
 saying
 that
 Texas
 reminds
 them


of
 California
 of
 2000s.
 Honestly,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 big
 compliment
 and
 also


it's
 a
 known
 fact
 that
 if
 Austin
 were
 a


standalone
 country,
 it
 would
 be
 the


eighth
 largest
 economy
 globally
 by


nominal
 GDP.
 To
 me,
 the
 Texas
 tech
 scene


is
 the
 perfect
 blend
 of
 the
 charisma
 and


hospitality
 of
 the
 South,
 the
 energy
 of


early
 stage
 old
 school
 Silicon
 Valley,


and
 a
 very
 American
 love
 of
 capitalism.


Austin
 has
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 tech
 hubs


cannot
 offer,
 the
 actual
 vibe.
 It's
 got


a
 lot
 of
 personality,
 live
 music,
 Texas


barbecue,
 weird
 little
 bars,
 and
 that


laid-back
 yet
 driven
 energy
 that
 you


rarely
 get
 at
 hyperoptimized
 tech
 hubs.


People
 here
 work
 and
 work
 hard,
 but
 they


also
 hang
 out.
 You
 can
 launch
 a
 product


and
 hit
 the
 lake
 before
 the
 sunset.
 It's


a
 city
 for
 people
 who
 want
 to
 work


without
 turning
 into
 robots.
 Cost
 of


living
 and
 salaries.
 Texas,
 like


Washington,
 still
 has
 no
 state
 income


tax,
 which
 gives
 you
 a
 nice
 head
 start


on
 savings.
 Product
 management,
 data


science,
 and
 software
 engineering


salaries
 are
 looking
 at
 the
 range


between
 140
 and
 180,
 perhaps
 200k
 plus


of
 total
 comp
 if
 you're
 lucky.


Conclusion:
 When
 is
 Austin
 a
 good
 idea?


You're
 a
 mid-level
 to
 senior
 level
 tech


professional
 who
 wants
 to
 grow
 without


burning
 out.
 You're
 into
 working
 at


preede
 or
 serious
 a
 phase.
 You're


betting
 on
 Texas
 becoming
 a
 major
 tech


player
 over
 the
 next
 10
 to
 20
 years
 and


you
 want
 in
 early.
 You
 have


entrepreneurial
 ambitions
 and
 you're


perhaps
 looking
 at
 various
 businesses,


not
 just
 tech.
 And
 you
 want
 access
 to


investors,
 early
 hires,
 and
 taxes
 that


won't
 destroy
 your
 ambition.
 When
 is


Texas
 not
 a
 good
 idea?
 If
 you're
 chasing


prestige
 logos
 and
 need
 that
 elite
 level


acceleration,
 you're
 thrive
 in
 high


density
 tech
 ecosystem
 with
 deep


technical
 complexity
 or
 cutting
 edge
 R&D


if
 you
 want
 that
 pressure
 and
 network


density
 of
 places
 like
 NYC,
 Seattle
 or


San
 Francisco
 to
 stay
 sharp
 and


motivated.
 Atlanta,
 Georgia.
 Tech
 scene


and
 culture.
 Atlanta
 has
 its
 strengths.


logistics,
 fintech,
 cyber
 security,


media
 tech,
 and
 increasingly
 AI


infrastructure.
 You've
 got
 Mailchimp,


NCR,
 Calendarly,
 Reddit,
 and
 lots
 of


tech
 roles
 from
 legacy
 and
 nontechnative


enterprises
 like
 Delta,
 Coca-Cola,
 Home


Depot,
 all
 building
 legit
 tech
 orcs.


It's
 also
 a
 growing
 B2B
 startup
 hub
 with


strong
 university
 to
 startup
 pipelines


coming
 from
 Georgia
 Tech.
 The
 startup


scene
 is
 getting
 real
 venture
 capital


money
 thanks
 to
 lower
 overhead
 and


founder
 friendly
 ecosystem.
 But
 don't


expect
 hyperrowth
 hype.
 Atlanta
 builds


with
 a
 southern
 draw
 measured
 and


sustainable
 quality
 of
 talent.
 Thanks
 to


Georgia
 Tech,
 the
 city
 produces
 some
 of


the
 sharpest
 engineers
 and
 data
 folks
 in


the
 country.
 There
 is
 a
 ton
 of
 homegrown


talent,
 plus
 a
 wave
 of
 boomerang
 tech


workers.
 people
 who
 did
 the
 San


Francisco
 and
 were
 done
 with
 it
 and
 now


coming
 back
 smarter,
 hungrier,
 and
 ready


to
 build
 something
 locally.
 Is
 it
 NYC


level
 dense?
 No.
 But
 the
 quality
 per


capita
 is
 very
 strong.
 You'll
 find
 smart


people
 who
 actually
 understand
 how
 to


build
 enterprise
 scale,
 not
 just
 the


reactive
 feature
 work.
 The
 vibes
 Atlanta


has
 a
 strong
 professional
 energy.
 People


move
 here
 to
 build
 stuff,
 grow
 fast,


raise
 families,
 raise
 capitals,
 and
 make


connections,
 not
 necessarily
 to
 unplug.


The
 tech
 community
 is
 very
 diverse,


driven,
 and
 tightly
 knit.
 You'll
 find
 a


lot
 of
 founders
 that
 are
 actually
 open


to
 helping
 each
 other.
 It's
 not
 as


intense
 as
 New
 York,
 but
 it's
 definitely


not
 slow.
 Culturally,
 Atlanta
 feels
 a


lot
 more
 social
 and
 extroverted
 than


most
 of
 the
 UX
 hubs.
 Cost
 of
 living
 and


salaries.
 Atlanta
 might
 be
 one
 of
 the


last
 major
 US
 cities
 where
 tech
 salaries


still
 feel
 very
 good.
 A
 mid-level
 PM
 or


data
 scientist
 can
 pull
 between
 120
 to


$160,000
 a
 year,
 perhaps
 180
 again
 if


you're
 lucky.
 Now,
 pair
 that
 with


Atlanta's
 cost
 of
 living,
 which
 yes,
 it


has
 risen,
 but
 still
 much
 better
 than


NYC
 or
 California
 or
 even
 Austin.


Conclusion:
 At
 what
 point
 in
 your
 career


is
 Atlanta
 a
 good
 move?
 If
 you're
 tired


of
 overpriced,
 overhyped
 tech
 cities
 and


looking
 for
 more
 stability,


affordability,
 and
 real
 cultural
 depth,


Atlanta
 does
 not
 have
 the
 loud
 noise
 of


NYC,
 or
 the
 big
 tech
 saturation
 of


Seattle.
 But
 what
 it
 does
 have
 is


balance.
 Great
 pay,
 lower
 cost
 of


living,
 high
 talent
 quality,
 and
 an


ecosystem
 where
 you
 can
 still
 keep


growing.
 When
 is
 Atlanta
 a
 bad
 idea?


Atlanta
 may
 not
 be
 the
 greatest
 idea
 if


you're
 chasing
 prestige
 or
 early
 stage


chaos.
 you
 might
 simply
 get
 bored.
 Also,


if
 you
 crave
 that
 insane
 energy
 and
 the


thrill
 of
 building
 something
 that
 is


going
 to
 change
 the
 world
 again,
 that's


a
 lot
 more
 West
 Coast.
 But
 if
 you're


playing
 the
 long
 game,
 Atlanta
 might


just
 be
 one
 of
 the
 best
 kept
 secrets
 in


the
 US.
 And
 that's
 a
 wrap
 for
 the
 US.


These
 were
 the
 five
 places
 in
 America


that
 I
 think
 are
 worth
 considering
 if


you're
 looking
 to
 move.
 Tell
 me
 if
 there


is
 anything
 you
 think
 I
 missed.
 We
 could


definitely
 do
 another
 part
 to
 this


video.
 The
 next
 one
 is
 Canada,
 so
 stay


tuned.
 As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this
 was


helpful.
 Till
