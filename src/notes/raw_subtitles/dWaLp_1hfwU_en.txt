As we've been talking about, Mike,
markets lower on fears of an escalating
trade war.
You're a macro guy.
Your international economics and policy
correspond.
Is this a rethink of U.S.
foreign.
Of U.S.
policy?
U.S.
trade policy?
It's just a social media post.
Yeah, I think well, there's a couple of
things going on.
And I think Erick's right that the
markets are using this as an excuse to
sell off because we don't know exactly
what's going to happen.
Chinese have said that they're going to
put new restrictions on rare earths and
super magnets and things like that that
have been under discussion.
And Xi and Trump are supposed to meet at
APEC later this month and talk about
this.
And there was thought that they might
reach some kind of deal.
Some analysts think that this is
basically the Chinese trying to get some
negotiating leverage and Trump doesn't
want to be backed into a corner.
So he's negotiating back in the kind of
language that he tends to use.
The Chinese, the main body of the
Chinese new restrictions wouldn't hit
till November or December.
So it's not something that's imminent.
And it could be that this is just all
posturing and one has to hope that at
this point.
But that may be why we've got a 2% fall
or roughly 2% fall and nothing worse.
I think if the president had really come
out and said, I'm going to jack up these
tariffs to 50, 60, 70%, then you would
see a much bigger reaction.
These comments, of course, are coming
before he's set to meet with Chinese
President Xi Jinping a little bit later
this month.
Have we heard any details about whether
that meeting is still going to be taking
place in the wake of the social media
posts?
Well, we haven't heard that it's off.
The Chinese didn't mention it's off.
And the president said, I don't see any
reason to meet right now.
But he didn't say I'm not going to.
So at this point, I think we just have
to wait and see how this plays out over
the next couple of days.
Maybe he gets it off.
Maybe he's mad because of the Nobel
Prize.
And instead of going after Norway, which
we all thought he do this morning, he's
just taking it out on China for the time
being.
But he was thanked by the winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize.
Well, yeah.
And then he reposted this.
Yes.
Basically, she she said we're counting
on President Trump and our friends in
democracies around the world to continue
the struggle for Venezuela.
She didn't say thank you, President
Trump.
Exactly.
Well, let's shift gears a little bit,
Mike, and talk about reductions in
force, the idea of layoffs, permanent
layoffs.
Russ vote earlier today.
Right.
House Budget director saying the
reductions in workforces, the reductions
in workforce have begun.
He he's referring to the federal
government's term for layoffs here.
Do we know how many do we know?
Who do we know where?
What we know is that there the White
House senior White House officials told
Bloomberg News that it would be
thousands.
Representative of the American
Federation of State, Local and
Government Employees said that they
heard 1300, but there's no exact number
at this point.
It does seem to be affecting many
agencies.
I've heard as many as nine.
And
this is obviously going to provoke
lawsuits from the federal unions, the
administration, and say this is
necessary because of the government
shutdown.
But it's not they've never done this
before.
Yeah, what the workers are being paid
right now.
So it doesn't it's just it's also
theater.
Now, does the administration, they could
be setting this up as a bargaining chip.
You know, Democrats come to the table
and they concede something and the
president says, all right, we won't fire
these people, because remember how this
went with the Dodge thing.
People were on the payroll.
Off the payroll.
On the payroll again.
So this could also be a big smokescreen.
I'm wondering how you think that kind of
impacts the what could be an already
weak labor market that we're seeing?
We had Governor Christopher Waller from
the Fed saying job growth has been
negative for the last few months.
The labor market is his biggest concern.
Of course, that's what we've also heard
from Jerome Powell, these firings.
Wouldn't that make the labor market even
weaker or is it not quite related?
There's not enough people getting fired.
I mean, is it terrible for them
individually?
But at this point, if you said
thousands, I mean, there are something
like 2 million federal employees, so it
wouldn't mean that many people are going
to affect the economy.
But it does contribute to the overall
sense that the country is not doing
well, that the economy is not doing
well, and that may hit consumer
confidence.
And and the more layoffs you have in
your neighborhood, the more you start to
worry about yourself and.
Then you cut back on spending.
And that's how recessions begin,
basically as a confidence matter.
So it's not good news in that sense, but
it's not something that we will really
see in the economy.
What ends up happening with government
shutdowns is spending is delayed, but
it's not completely gone.
People will get their back pay in
theory.
The administration is threatening that,
too.
But the law says they get paid and then
they'll go make the important payments
that they have to make.
And I'm sure they'll use their charge
cards for groceries and things like that
in the meantime.
Well, speaking of getting paid,
Argentina is about to get paid to the
tune of $20 billion.
Is it fair to call this a bailout?
It's fair to call it a bailout, but
they're not really going to get $20
billion from the U.S..
Essentially, what we're they're calling
it a swap line, which it isn't exactly
either.
The swap line is an agreement between
two central banks.
One that needs dollars sends money to
the Fed, and the Fed sends the
equivalent amount in dollars to them so
that their companies in that country can
pay their dollar denominated bills and
then they send it back.
And when it when the crisis is over and
the Fed sends them back their money,
this is more like a rescue package along
the lines of what happened with Mexico
in 1994, where the U.S.
used the exchange stabilization fund and
agreed to guarantee Mexico Mexican bonds
that couldn't be sold because there was
a concern about whether or not they
would default.
And so the US guaranteed those the U.S.
bought some of the assets.
They didn't give Mexico cash directly,
and I don't think we're giving Argentina
cash directly, but it'll be a system set
up like that.
Is it a little different than Mexico
back then, though, because we share a
border with Mexico.
The stability of Mexico is in our best
interest because it's such a large
trading partner, at least right now.
I mean, Argentina is a little bit of a
different story.
It seems more political.
Well, there's definitely a political
angle to it, and it just kind of depends
on what your cynicism meter goes up to.
Argentina is obviously a poster child
for bad financial management.
They owe the IMF billions and billions
of dollars.
They've defaulted something like 23
times.
And you could argue that it could be a
sort of economic domino in the way we
saw things happen in the in the Asian
financial crisis.
But there's also the idea that a lot of
the hedge funds that
hedge fund leaders who worked with Scott
Bessant over the years have loaded up on
Argentine debt distress because they buy
it at a discount.
And if the Argentine peso keeps falling,
as it has and is predicted to do, if
they lose the congressional elections
coming up, then these people lose a lot
of money.
And if the US can prop up the peso, then
it helps besson's friends.
Now.
I don't have any evidence one way or
another.
But The New York Times is reporting
this.
Paul Krugman did a column on it today.
So that is something for I don't think
you have to go as far as a tinfoil hat,
maybe maybe Saran wrap hat like that,
too, you know.
But, yeah, that could be maybe it's in
the same drawer where you would find the
tinfoil.
Well, and you get you get in these
situations, you get people who are
nervous about the impact on
American investors and funds.
We saw the same thing happen with
Greece.
And Greece was definitely going to
default, but it was handled very
gingerly so it didn't cause systemic
problems.
Well, this coming from the Treasury
Department, but certainly the next Fed
chair might be thinking about the
implications of this.
And that's kind of where we want to end
with you, Mike.
We learned earlier today some other
names that could be in the running or
are in the running for Fed chair.
Finalists
Rick Rieder, Michele Bowman, Chris
Waller, Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett.
What's the timeline here?
Is there anyone else?
A CNBC report that they are the final
five, okay.
And that they would do another round of
interviews and then sometime maybe in
December, the president would nominate
someone to the Stephen Myron seat that
where the term expires at the end of
January and that person would be
essentially the de facto Fed chair in
waiting.
And then if Jay Powell resigns, they
could put Steve Myron back in that seat
or somebody else.
We don't have any other outside
confirmation of that, but it certainly
tracks with what the president has been
saying.
He's called the Kevins and Chris Waller,
the finalist for some time.
Michele Bachmann might be a little bit
of a deal here because we know they like
her in the
in the regulatory role that that she's
in.
And Rick Rieder obviously has a good
reputation in the markets.
It depends on what the president
ultimately ends up wanting in a Fed
chair.
How much of a splash does he want to
make?
And sense of a rock falling in the pond
and sending out Ripple?
How much does he want to upset the apple
cart and how much can he do without
upsetting the markets?
So this is going to be something to
watch over the next couple of weeks,
because once we get to an announcement,
there's going to be a lot of reaction to
that as well.
Well, we'll certainly be talking to you
many times between now and then.
