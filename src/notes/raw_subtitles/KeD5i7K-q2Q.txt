The
 most
 uh
 profound
 experience
 that
 I


had
 in
 my
 career
 uh
 in
 healthcare
 and


one
 that
 I
 consider
 my
 most
 important


accomplishment
 was
 uh
 in
 in
 my
 previous


venture
 to
 to
 get
 more
 than
 25,000
 notes


from
 people
 saying
 thank
 you
 for
 saving


my
 life.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 really
 like


amazing
 it
 was
 profound.
 I
 mean
 like


it's
 you
 know
 from
 somebody
 who's
 uh
 who


had
 dreams
 as
 a
 child
 as
 a
 you
 know
 a


computer
 geek
 to
 to
 build
 things
 that


that
 have
 some
 impact
 to
 to
 really
 get


you
 know
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 notes
 for


people
 saying
 thank
 you
 for
 saving
 my


life
 is
 something
 that
 uh
 you
 know


it's
 bringing
 me
 to
 tears
 right
 now
 just


to
 talk
 about
 this
 right
 I
 mean
 it's


it's
 it's
 really
 like
 I
 getting
 I'm


getting
 goosebumps
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that


like
 the
 the
 it's
 it's
 just
 it
 just
 it


really
 is
 special
 always
 do
 what
 you


love.


Always
 do
 what
 you
 love,
 right?
 Like,


start
 by
 doing
 what
 you
 love.
 I
 mean,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 choose
 to
 do
 things


because
 they're
 cool,
 uh,
 because


they're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money,


uh,
 because
 it's
 fashionable,
 uh,


because
 somebody
 told
 them
 to
 do
 that,


because
 other
 people
 are
 doing
 that,


right?
 Like
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons.
 Just
 don't


like
 go
 into
 where
 your
 heart
 is,
 right?


Like
 do
 things
 that
 you
 love.
 Why?


Because
 when
 you
 do
 thing
 that
 you
 love,


it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 work
 and
 you're


going
 to
 become
 a
 lot
 more
 successful


and
 happier
 most
 importantly.
 It's
 not


just
 about
 success.
 You
 want
 to
 be
 happy


in
 your
 life.
 So
 follow
 your
 real


passion
 and
 then
 everything
 else
 will


follow
 like
 the
 the
 money,
 the
 fame,
 the


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 do
 when
 you
 do


things
 you
 love,
 they
 will
 come.


[Music]


Okay.
 Nice
 to
 meet
 you.
 Uh
 my
 name
 is


Ron
 Goodman.
 and
 uh
 co-founder
 and
 CEO


of
 uh
 Intrivo.
 We
 really
 like
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 Invo
 the
 the
 vision
 was
 to


to
 bring
 health
 and
 care
 to
 you
 where


you
 are.
 Now
 when
 the
 pandemic
 started


we
 tried
 to
 see
 where
 we
 can
 apply
 this


to
 actually
 help
 resolve
 the
 pandemic


and
 then
 we
 start
 solving
 the
 challenge


of
 how
 do
 we
 bring
 efficient
 testing
 to


use.
 So
 initially
 testing
 if
 you


remember
 was
 a
 terrible
 user
 experience.


We
 created
 this
 technology
 platform
 that


enable
 us
 to
 manage
 the
 entire
 supply


chain.
 And
 I
 really
 would
 like
 to
 be


part
 of
 creating
 a
 solution
 like
 that


that
 will
 change
 the
 way
 we
 manage
 our


health
 and
 well-being
 in
 ways
 that
 were


just
 not
 possible
 before.
 And
 I
 think
 AI


has
 a
 a
 great
 opportunity
 to
 be
 the


foundation
 for
 that.
 And
 I'm
 looking


forward
 to
 the
 next
 chapter
 of
 uh
 you


know
 how
 humanity
 managing
 not
 only


health
 and
 well-being
 but
 happiness
 as


well
 because
 I
 want
 more
 people
 to
 smile


a
 lot
 more
 often.


[Music]


The
 whole
 idea
 of
 helping
 other
 people


uh
 came
 from
 home.
 My
 mom
 uh
 raised
 me


with
 the
 the
 notion
 of
 tikun
 lam


which
 is
 an
 ancient
 uh
 part
 of
 Jewish


philosophy
 and
 tikunol
 lam
 means
 in


English
 very
 simply
 fixing
 the
 world.


What
 does
 fixing
 the
 world
 mean?
 My
 mom


used
 to
 explain
 that
 fixing
 the
 world
 is


something
 that
 is
 important
 for
 me
 to


engage
 in
 just
 because
 the
 world
 needs


fixing.
 It
 doesn't
 need
 to
 give
 me


anything.
 It
 doesn't
 need
 to
 have
 a


reason
 for
 it.
 But
 because
 things
 are


not
 the
 way
 they
 should
 be
 and
 I
 have


the
 ability
 to
 make
 a
 positive
 influence


with
 them,
 I
 should
 do
 it.
 And
 think


about
 it.
 If
 everybody
 thought
 this
 way


and
 pay
 it
 forward
 without
 even
 needing


to
 get
 anything,
 our
 world
 will
 look


such
 a
 better
 place.
 Every
 single
 day
 I


do
 things
 that
 help
 other
 people
 improve


their
 lives,
 improve
 their
 health
 and


well-being.
 Some
 of
 these
 uh
 really


important
 lessons
 that
 I've
 learned.
 Uh


first
 and
 foremost
 was
 traveling,


traveling
 around
 the
 world.
 So
 I
 I
 I


love
 travel.
 I
 love
 meeting
 people
 all


over
 the
 world.
 I
 made
 it
 a
 point
 to


meet
 people
 where
 they
 are
 and
 go
 and


stay
 where
 they
 stay,
 eat
 where
 they


eat,
 travel
 how
 they
 travel,
 volunteer


as
 much
 as
 I
 could.
 And
 when
 I
 did
 that,


I
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 them
 and
 that


helped
 shape
 me
 as
 an
 entrepreneur


because
 when
 you
 build
 solutions
 that


are
 global
 solution,
 you
 need
 to


understand
 the
 world.
 And
 understanding


the
 world
 is
 not
 enough
 to
 just
 do


internet
 research.
 I
 believe
 you
 need
 to


meet
 the
 people
 and
 need
 to
 see
 them


where
 they
 are.
 Understand
 all
 people


are
 people
 and
 and
 all
 humans
 are
 very


much
 similar
 but
 they
 have
 nuances
 and


if
 you
 understand
 these
 nuances
 and
 you


understand
 different
 approach
 approaches


to
 solving
 problems
 it
 creates
 for
 you
 a


toolkit
 that
 is
 a
 lot
 richer
 when
 you


tackle
 some
 of
 these
 challenges
 to
 not


just
 look
 at
 it
 the
 way
 all
 of
 us
 look


at
 a
 certain
 thing
 but
 find
 different


angles
 that
 may
 be
 more
 applicable
 for


particular
 challenges
 than
 the
 tools


that
 you
 have
 in
 your
 regular
 toolkit.


So
 one
 uh
 was
 definitely
 travel
 and
 and


and
 I
 recommend
 uh
 people
 to
 do
 that
 and


particularly
 meet
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 doing


that


[Music]


being
 in
 the
 valley
 in
 a
 time
 that
 was


you
 know
 post
 the
 the
 dot
 crash
 actually


when
 most
 people
 left
 here
 and
 just
 a


handful
 of
 people
 uh
 remained
 that
 were


very
 very
 passionate
 about
 building


businesses.
 And
 and
 some
 of
 these
 people


that
 were
 very
 very
 early
 in
 their


career
 back
 then
 are
 some
 of
 the
 most


successful
 entrepreneurs
 of
 our
 time


today.
 But
 the
 people
 who
 really
 stayed


here
 stayed
 because
 they
 were
 passionate


about
 building
 things
 that
 actually
 make


a
 difference
 and
 change
 the
 world.
 and


having
 long
 conversations
 with
 them,
 you


know,
 early
 early
 in
 their
 career
 about


how
 they
 think
 about
 building
 companies,


how
 they
 think
 about
 building
 teams
 uh


very
 early
 uh
 in
 the
 TED
 community
 for


example
 uh
 the
 the
 TED
 conference
 before


there
 was
 even
 TED
 X
 before
 there
 were


like
 a
 million
 conferences
 before
 there


was
 even
 a
 website
 I
 used
 to
 go
 to
 to


Mterrey
 it
 was
 like
 we
 used
 to
 go
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 from
 Silicon
 Valley
 uh


to
 to
 Monterey
 every
 year
 and
 and
 it
 was


a
 small
 handful
 of
 people
 that
 got
 It


was
 all
 the
 people
 that
 started
 the
 most


successful
 companies
 that
 you
 know
 in


the
 world
 right
 now.
 It
 was
 back
 then.


And
 we,
 you
 know,
 we
 would
 go
 and
 hear


some
 talks
 and
 then
 at
 night
 we'd
 spend


until
 2,
 three
 or
 4:00
 in
 the
 morning


just
 hanging
 out,
 chatting,
 talking


about
 our
 challenges,
 you
 know,
 figuring


out
 what
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was


amazingly
 amazingly
 important
 in
 shaping


how
 all
 of
 us
 thought
 about
 doing


certain
 things.
 Just
 interacting
 with


one
 another,
 working
 with
 some
 of
 them


that
 were
 more
 accomplished
 and
 already


had,
 you
 know,
 some
 success.
 Some
 of


them
 it
 was
 their
 first
 time
 of
 doing


this
 but
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 The
 the


sharing
 was
 very
 important.
 So
 we
 did


that
 at
 TED.
 We
 did
 it
 in
 the
 early
 days


of
 South
 by
 Southwest
 when
 it
 was
 mostly


a
 music
 festival
 that
 was
 a
 tiny
 little


interactive
 section
 to
 it.
 There
 was
 a


couple
 hundred
 people
 or
 whatever
 the


number
 was
 back
 then.
 And
 the
 same
 thing


we
 used
 to
 go
 there
 every
 year
 and
 and


just
 hang
 out
 with
 each
 other
 and
 and


chat
 about
 it.


[Music]


It's
 really
 really
 great
 to
 be
 here
 and


I
 I
 really
 want
 to
 say
 before
 I
 start


talking
 about
 that
 Silicon
 Valley
 I


really
 want
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is
 this
 is


not
 a
 community
 this
 is
 a
 movement
 I


mean
 seriously
 I
 want
 to
 give
 a
 huge


hand
 to
 Lara
 and
 Salomi
 like
 from


everyone
 like
 it's
 it's
 just


it's
 unbelievable
 it's
 so
 powerful
 We're


talking
 about
 collaboration.
 We're


talking
 about
 what
 we
 how
 can
 we


leverage
 the
 learning
 that
 everyone
 here


has
 achieved
 by
 putting
 together
 these


amazing
 events
 in
 universities,
 in


cities
 and
 everything
 and
 exchange
 this


information,
 share
 it
 together
 and


talking
 with
 Lara
 about
 trying
 to
 create


a
 platform
 that
 will
 make
 it
 very
 easy


to
 disseminate
 this
 information
 on
 an


ongoing
 basis.
 You
 know,
 you
 all
 put


together
 programs,
 you
 all
 put
 together


some
 software
 or
 something
 that
 helped


you
 make
 a
 better
 event.
 And
 I
 I
 felt


putting
 together
 TEDx
 Silicon
 Valley


that
 if
 we
 could
 tap
 into
 some
 of
 that


or
 if
 we
 can
 share
 what
 we've
 created


with
 everyone
 else,
 it
 would
 be


amazingly
 powerful.
 So
 this
 is
 something


that
 uh
 I'm
 very
 excited
 to
 help
 doing


going
 forward.
 Uh
 and
 and
 it's
 really


really
 uh
 important
 to
 get
 together
 in


these
 gatherings,
 right,
 that
 are


smaller
 gatherings
 with
 people
 who
 are


experiencing
 the
 same
 thing
 that
 you're


experiencing
 and
 share
 authentically


what
 you're
 going
 through
 in
 these
 long


midnight,
 you
 know,
 conversations,
 but


also
 absorb
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 how
 they're


solving
 thing
 and
 get
 inspired
 by
 that.


So
 that
 was
 really
 awesome.


Entrepreneurship


is
 all
 about
 the
 people.
 It's
 all
 about


you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 only
 as
 successful


as
 the
 people
 around
 you.
 And
 it's
 very


important
 to
 choose
 the
 people
 that
 you


don't
 only
 think
 they're
 the
 best
 in


doing
 what
 they
 need
 to
 do.
 And
 that's


very
 important
 as
 a
 foundation.
 Choose


people
 who
 have
 the
 right
 skill
 and


right
 kind
 of
 level
 of
 experience
 to
 do


what
 they
 need
 to
 do.
 but
 also
 make
 sure


that
 they
 have
 the
 kind
 of
 energy
 right


and
 the
 stamina
 and
 the
 kind
 of


resilience
 that
 is
 required
 in
 order
 to


solve
 entrepreneurial
 challenges.


Sometimes
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 chose
 people


who
 who
 actually
 were
 great
 and
 smart


and
 capable
 and
 had
 great
 resumes
 but


you
 know
 they
 did
 not
 have
 this
 kind
 of


dynamic
 and
 or
 this
 kind
 of
 character


that
 would
 take
 them
 through
 a
 lot
 of


ups
 and
 downs
 which
 entrepreneurship
 is


has
 inevitable
 huge
 amount
 of
 these


things.
 So
 think
 about
 how
 to
 bring


people,
 communicate
 to
 them.
 Don't


overcommunicate
 to
 them
 something
 that


like,
 oh
 yes,
 we're
 going
 to
 everything


is
 going to
 be
 great.
 We're
 going to


build
 a
 huge
 company.
 We're
 going
 to


change
 the
 world.
 That's
 great.
 Get
 them


inspired,
 but
 also
 be
 truthful
 to
 them.


Hey,
 this
 journey
 is
 going
 to
 have
 ups


and
 downs.
 There
 will
 be
 some
 tough


days.
 You
 need
 to
 think
 about
 that.
 And


here's
 what's
 coming
 up
 next.
 Make
 sure


that
 they
 are
 the
 right
 people.
 Also,


what's
 important
 is
 that
 they
 gel
 with


each
 other
 really
 well.
 Choose
 the
 right


kind
 of
 characters
 that
 get
 along
 with


each
 other
 well,
 that
 play
 well
 in
 a


team,
 right?
 Unless
 they're
 a
 personal


contributor
 that
 really
 wants
 to
 needs


to
 do
 one
 very
 particular
 thing
 and


they're
 excellent
 at
 it
 and
 doesn't


require
 collaboration.
 That's
 rare,
 but


that's
 sometimes
 important
 in
 things


that
 you're
 building.
 The
 majority
 of


people
 work
 with
 each
 other
 and
 teamwork


does
 make
 the
 dream
 work,
 right?
 So
 you


need
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 choose
 people


that
 get
 not
 only
 are
 great
 people
 and


are
 social,
 but
 they
 get
 along
 with
 each


other
 really
 really
 well,
 right?
 And
 and


so
 that's
 that's
 a
 very
 very
 important


thing.
 And
 eventually
 people
 that
 really


resonate
 with
 the
 mission.
 I
 learned
 in


my
 life
 that
 it's
 important
 to
 have


missionaries
 and
 not
 mercenaries.
 Right?


There's
 some
 people
 who
 are
 really
 good


in
 what
 they're
 doing,
 but
 they're
 just


there
 for
 the
 paycheck
 and
 they
 do
 what


they
 need
 to
 do
 and
 they're
 done.
 Right?


I
 think
 the
 best
 way
 to
 identify
 if


somebody
 truly
 uh
 buys
 into
 a
 mission
 is


to
 have
 a
 deep
 conversation
 with
 them


that
 is
 situational.
 Don't
 just
 ask
 them


to
 talk
 in
 generalities
 about
 uh
 the


mission
 itself.
 Like
 it's
 everybody
 can


say,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 yeah,
 I
 really
 want
 to


help
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 or
 billions
 of


people
 live
 a
 healthier
 life."
 I
 mean


that's
 a
 very
 easy
 sentence
 to
 practice


at
 home
 in
 a
 job
 interview
 and
 and
 then


you
 know
 site
 it
 back.
 The
 best
 way
 to


tackle
 this
 is
 to
 ask
 them
 how
 they


practiced
 this
 uh
 this
 kind
 of
 mission,


this
 kind
 of
 uh
 world,
 this
 kind
 of


living,
 this
 kind
 of
 philosophy
 in
 their


own
 life
 in
 the
 past,
 right?
 So,
 so
 to


give
 you
 examples,
 right,
 of
 why
 they


actually
 resonate
 with
 that
 mission
 or


how
 they
 resonate
 with
 that
 mission,
 but


things
 that
 they
 did,
 not
 just
 things


that
 they're
 thinking
 about,
 right?


Right?
 And
 even
 if
 it's
 small
 things,


you
 know,
 some
 people
 want
 to
 help
 a


billion
 people
 and
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 daunting
 for
 them
 to
 even
 think


about
 it
 because
 they're
 early
 in
 their


career.
 So
 what
 how
 do
 you
 know
 because


they're
 early
 in
 their
 career?
 But


people
 who
 really
 care
 about
 these


things
 do
 things
 in
 their
 lives
 that


actually
 show
 that
 they
 are
 very
 very


interested
 in
 the
 mission.
 So
 look
 for


the
 doers,
 not
 just
 the
 thinkers.


So
 every
 everything
 that's
 worth
 doing


is
 challenging
 in
 my
 mind,
 right?
 I


think
 that
 there
 is
 a
 point
 in
 life
 in


which
 you
 just
 embrace
 challenge,
 right?


And
 and
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 learned
 over


the
 years
 and
 I
 practice
 right
 now
 is,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 get
 too
 worked
 up
 when


things
 are
 uh
 challenging
 and
 I
 don't


get
 too
 excited
 when
 things
 are
 great,


right?
 I
 try
 to
 just
 accept
 the
 fact


that
 there's
 beauty
 in
 what
 we
 define
 as


good
 and
 pleasurable
 and
 nice
 and
 and


and
 you
 know
 fulfilling
 but
 there's
 also


beauty
 in
 things
 that
 are
 challenging


actually
 sometime
 make
 people
 sad.
 I


know
 that
 sounds
 a
 little
 bit


controversial
 but
 when
 you
 understand


that
 the
 life
 is
 the
 circular
 approach


and
 the
 whole
 approach
 of
 everything


that's
 happening
 to
 us
 good
 and
 bad
 and


and
 when
 you
 stop
 judging
 them
 when
 you


start
 stop
 trying
 to
 just
 go
 to
 only


figure
 out
 how
 to
 make
 things
 good
 and


try
 to
 avoid
 the
 bad
 because
 the
 bad


what
 we
 consider
 as
 bad
 or
 less


favorable
 will
 happen.
 Not
 strive
 to


make
 it
 happen
 but
 accept
 it.
 they
 say,


you
 know,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 there.
 It's


fine.
 And
 it's
 it's
 it's
 something
 that


is
 part
 of
 life
 and
 we
 celebrate
 it.
 We


celebrate
 the
 good.
 We
 celebrate
 the
 not


so
 good.
 It
 makes
 us
 stronger.
 And
 I


think
 that
 the
 advice
 that
 I
 give


everybody
 is
 to
 try
 to
 get
 to
 that
 place


at least
 once
 a
 day.
 And
 then
 once
 you


figure
 out
 where
 it
 is
 to
 start
 applying


it
 here
 and
 there
 so
 you
 can
 go
 back
 to


this
 clean
 slate
 cuz
 you're
 going
 to


make
 better
 decisions,
 you're
 going
 to


feel
 better
 with
 yourself
 and
 you're


going
 to
 have
 a
 better,
 happier
 life.
