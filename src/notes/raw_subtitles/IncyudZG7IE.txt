thank
 you
 everyone
 and
 welcome
 to
 this


uh
 Coffee
 Talk
 uh
 today
 we
 are
 going
 to


run
 you
 through
 our
 four
 strategic
 goals


uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to


communication
 what
 we
 have
 done
 to
 uh


achieve
 them
 but
 we're
 just
 going
 to


dive
 straight
 into
 it
 we
 have
 translated


the
 strategy
 plan
 that
 you
 find
 out


there
 into
 four
 key
 targets
 so
 these
 are


our
 four
 targets
 that
 we
 worked
 with


against
 as
 a
 communication
 department


and
 as
 a
 overall
 organization
 the
 first


one
 is
 about
 internal
 communication
 uh


it's
 about
 boosting
 performance
 through


effective
 internal
 communication
 we
 need


good
 information
 sharing
 so
 that
 we
 know


what
 other
 people
 are
 doing
 and
 Damon


will
 talk
 more
 about
 that
 today
 the


second
 goal
 we
 have
 is
 to
 increase


knowledge
 and
 Trust
 about
 the
 fun
 among


key
 stakeholders
 in


Norway
 we
 are
 a
 public
 fund
 uh
 over
 one


main
 client
 that
 is
 the
 Norwegian
 people


and
 that
 is
 the
 client
 we
 need
 to


communicate


with
 then
 the
 third
 goal
 is
 to
 position


the
 fund
 as
 a
 preferred
 employer
 among


students
 and
 young
 professional
 and
 that


goal
 we
 did
 not
 have
 uh
 in
 previous


years
 uh
 is
 something
 we
 have
 worked
 a


lot
 uh
 towards
 to
 achieve
 both
 to
 get


the
 best
 employees
 in
 here
 but
 also
 to


increase
 the
 knowledge
 among
 younger


stakeholders
 which
 we
 see
 have
 in


general
 low
 lower
 knowledge
 about


finance
 and
 about
 the
 fund
 and
 then
 uh


over
 four
 goal
 is
 about
 markets
 out


there
 it's
 about
 strengthening


understanding
 of
 the
 funds
 roles
 as
 a


financial
 and
 responsible
 investor


abroad
 we
 will
 talk
 about
 which
 key


markets
 we
 uh
 operate
 in
 and
 uh
 talk
 to


and
 how
 we
 focus
 uh
 in
 here
 and
 it's


maybe
 more
 important
 than
 ever
 that
 how


we
 operate
 and
 what
 we're
 doing
 is


understood
 in
 the
 market
 and
 then
 they


understand
 that
 we
 are
 a
 financial


investor
 but
 we
 need
 to
 be
 operate
 in
 a


responsible
 manner
 uh
 so
 boosting


performance
 through
 effective
 internal


communication
 might
 sound
 like
 a
 bit
 of


a
 stretch
 to
 some
 of
 you
 but
 there's


loads
 of
 uh
 research
 out
 there
 showing


that
 companies
 that
 communicate
 well


have
 better
 performance
 higher


engagement
 lower
 turnover
 uh
 execute


project
 better
 and
 just
 about
 every


other
 indicator
 you
 can
 think
 of
 so
 how


do
 we
 do
 that
 we're
 trying
 to
 we're


trying
 to
 find
 a
 balance
 between
 uh


face-to-face
 communication
 our
 digital


tools
 and
 our
 events
 so
 whenever
 we
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 few
 new
 ideas
 and
 so
 on


but
 we
 always
 try
 to
 come
 back
 to
 this


balance
 because
 we
 think
 it's
 sort
 of


the
 best
 way
 to
 build
 trust
 um
 build


connections
 um
 and
 get
 communication


flowing
 quickly


and
 all
 those
 things
 rely
 on
 you
 so
 we


see
 nbim
 employees
 at
 the
 center
 of
 the


strategy
 and
 that's
 really
 because
 when


you
 think
 about
 our
 Workforce
 right


Highly
 Educated
 people
 um
 all
 online
 and


dispersed
 across
 uh
 several
 offices


probably
 the
 least
 efficient
 thing
 you


could
 do
 is
 put
 someone
 in
 head
 office


and
 get
 them
 to
 put
 all
 the
 news
 out
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 organization


so
 a
 much
 more
 efficient
 way
 to
 do
 that


is
 for
 us
 to
 enable
 you
 to
 give
 you
 the


tools
 and
 the
 structure
 to
 coach
 and


whatever
 is
 needed
 um
 just
 point
 people


in
 the
 right
 direction
 but
 you
 are
 the


ones
 that
 are
 best
 at
 communicating
 your


message
 and
 you
 know
 what
 we've
 been
 on


this
 journey
 for
 like
 two
 years
 and
 I


think
 you
 know
 the
 way
 people
 have


responded
 here
 is
 really
 amazing
 um


seeing
 so
 many
 of
 you
 getting
 involved


in
 uh
 speaking
 on
 the
 uh
 the
 Monday


meeting
 setting
 up
 coffee
 talks
 uh


posting
 stuff
 on
 Yama
 uh
 and
 all
 sorts


so
 uh
 from
 email
 and
 you
 know
 when
 you


think
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 like
 closed


and
 open
 uh
 say


platforms
 you've
 got
 email
 and
 teams


which
 work
 really
 well
 for
 us
 but


they're
 closed
 so
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 is


go
 more
 towards
 open
 platforms
 like


yamma
 Monday
 meeting
 even
 the
 Monday


meeting
 chat
 some
 something
 where


everyone
 has
 the
 opportunity
 to
 to
 uh


see
 and


respond
 so
 I've
 just
 got
 a
 couple
 of


examples
 for
 you
 of
 kind
 of
 why
 we
 want


that
 and
 why
 something
 like
 yemma
 is


better
 than
 email
 for
 for
 the
 kind
 of


messages
 that
 we
 want
 everyone
 to
 be


able
 to


see
 so
 Marius
 went
 to
 the
 biggest
 AI


what
 is
 it
 uh
 responsible
 AI
 conference


in
 the
 world
 in
 Brazil
 right
 and
 he


could
 have
 sent
 that
 as
 an
 email
 to
 who


is
 it
 Oscar
 uh
 Sig
 good
 the
 few
 people


that
 he
 tagged
 there
 but
 then
 it
 sort
 of


it
 stays
 between
 those
 four
 people
 right


so
 he
 put
 it
 out
 and
 then
 Lydia
 who
 he


didn't
 know


responded
 they
 kind
 of
 realized
 that
 oh


they
 had
 something
 in
 common
 here


something
 to
 discuss
 and
 they
 set
 up
 a


meeting
 and
 they've
 been
 meeting
 ever


since
 then
 uh
 to
 discuss
 responsible
 Ai


and
 governance
 and
 and
 so


on
 so
 much
 better
 as
 a
 post
 Daniel
 could


have
 sent
 this
 you
 know
 in
 a
 teams
 chat


to
 12
 PMS
 or
 something
 like
 that
 uh
 to


his
 team
 or
 even
 to
 all
 of
 eqs
 but
 by


putting
 it
 out
 there
 then
 we
 got
 to
 hear


the
 response
 from
 active
 ownership
 and


this
 is
 like
 you
 know
 really
 key
 stuff


to
 the
 future
 of
 nbim
 Future
 Finance


really
 important


discussions
 and
 same
 thing
 with
 B
 right


and
 this
 is
 like
 such
 an
 easy
 win
 when


PMS
 go
 away
 and
 we've
 seen
 them
 doing


more
 of
 this
 instead
 of
 putting
 it
 on


tamale
 notes
 or
 sharing
 it
 with
 their


team
 if
 you
 go
 away
 on
 a
 field
 trip
 and


you
 learn
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 like
 share
 it


with
 everyone
 and
 just
 put
 it
 out
 there


and
 then
 you
 know
 you'll
 see
 that
 some


people
 that
 uh
 you
 didn't
 even
 know
 were


interested
 are
 interested
 and
 will
 react


to
 it
 great
 Damon
 um
 so
 then
 the
 next


goal
 we
 are
 working
 towards
 is
 then
 uh


towards
 the
 key
 stakeholders
 in
 Norway


to
 increase
 knowledge
 and
 trust
 and
 what


we
 see
 from
 we
 you
 measure
 our


reputational
 and
 Bal
 basis
 is
 that
 those


uh
 who
 know
 more
 about
 us
 have
 bigger


trust
 in
 what
 we
 do
 and
 in
 that
 way
 uh


that
 is
 super
 important
 for
 us
 uh
 as
 a
 a


public
 uh
 fund
 so
 our
 strategy
 is
 to
 be


transparent
 and
 to
 build
 knowledge
 that


is
 the
 key
 to
 this
 uh
 strategy
 and
 our


overall
 communication
 goal
 is
 to
 be
 the


most
 transparent
 Fund
 in
 the
 world
 and


when
 we
 first
 set
 had
 that
 goal
 we
 had


no
 way
 of
 measuring
 it
 it
 was
 kind
 of


like
 a
 fluffy
 Direction
 This
 is
 the


direction
 we
 want
 to
 go
 overall
 we
 want


to
 be
 transparent
 but
 then
 um
 Sam


benchmarking
 came
 out
 with
 a
 new


Benchmark
 they
 Benchmark
 cost
 and


performance
 for
 fun
 for
 years
 they


started
 a
 benchmarking
 transparency
 and


we
 were
 not
 number
 one
 but
 really
 wanted


to
 win
 this
 uh
 otherwise
 we
 wouldn't
 be


the
 world's
 most
 transparent
 Fone
 so
 we


put
 down
 a
 group
 uh
 from
 Cross
 teams


across
 MIM
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 uh
 participated


there
 and
 we
 truly
 appreciate
 it
 and


then
 for
 the
 first
 time
 last
 year
 we


became
 number
 one
 and
 we
 are
 the
 world's


most
 transparent
 fund
 and
 it's
 measured


across
 four
 uh
 categories
 and
 it's
 done


in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 need
 to
 find
 this


information
 uh
 in
 an
 easy
 way
 at
 our
 web


page
 then
 we
 did
 uh
 quite
 well
 across


all
 the
 four
 categories
 uh
 but
 we
 were


pretty
 sure
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 even


harder
 this
 year
 and
 the
 question
 we


asked
 ourself
 can
 we
 push
 ourself
 even


further
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 discussions


in
 the
 leader
 group
 at
 different


departments
 uh
 in
 the
 fund
 and
 I
 guess


the
 answer
 was
 yes
 we
 can
 push
 ourselves


even
 further
 because
 this
 year
 we
 got


100
 in
 all
 the
 categories
 so
 we
 are


fully
 transparent
 on
 all
 the
 parameters


that
 some
 are
 benchmarking
 this
 75
 large


fund
 across
 uh
 the
 ball
 but
 I
 think
 for


me
 the
 cool
 thing
 here
 is
 is
 not
 only


are
 we
 even
 more
 transparent
 but
 when
 we


look
 at
 the
 10
 largest
 investment
 fund


they
 all
 improved
 quite
 a
 lot
 over
 the


last
 two
 years
 so
 I
 guess
 a
 bit
 of
 a


healthy
 competition
 uh
 is
 good
 because


it
 has
 increased
 transparency
 uh
 across


uh
 the


board
 then
 Lena
 over
 to
 our
 approach
 to


media
 in
 Norway
 yes
 so
 media
 is
 of


course
 a
 very
 important
 channel
 to
 reach


are
 stakeholders
 in
 Norway
 uh
 and
 we


have
 three
 sort
 of
 main
 pillars
 uh
 to


how
 we
 work
 with
 media
 first
 of
 all
 it's


just
 handling
 all
 the
 incoming
 requests


we
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 requests
 every
 day


from
 all
 over
 the
 world
 and
 it's
 h
 it's


a
 massive
 job
 just
 responding
 to


everything
 and
 we
 have
 a
 24hour
 response


policy
 we
 try
 to
 answer
 everything


within
 24
 hours
 uh
 that's
 also
 in
 our


interest
 because
 uh
 deadlines
 uh
 are
 no


longer
 fixed
 to
 when
 the
 paper
 newspaper


come
 out
 as
 a
 used
 to
 be
 now
 it's
 on
 web


and
 it's
 constant
 so
 if
 we
 are
 delayed


in
 responding
 uh
 the
 journalists
 will


often
 just
 publish
 a
 story
 anyway
 and
 we


come
 off
 uh
 worse
 than
 if
 we
 had
 a


comment
 on
 so
 that's
 why
 sometime
 when


we
 reach
 out
 to
 you
 we
 give
 you
 really


short
 deadlines
 but
 just
 that's
 just


because
 we
 are
 under
 uh
 time
 pressure
 to


really
 responding
 uh
 quickly
 just
 a
 very


quick
 examples
 of
 a
 proactive
 initiative


uh
 Karina
 has
 a
 column
 in
 e24
 where
 she


writes
 about
 the
 ownership
 topics
 has


been
 really
 successful
 a
 great
 way
 to


get
 uh
 knowledge
 out
 of
 how
 we
 work
 on


ownership
 uh
 then
 we
 have
 uh
 gather
 some


data
 from
 retri
 who
 an
 external
 media


monitoring
 firm
 uh
 just
 to
 see
 how
 much


we
 are
 mentioned
 out
 there
 where
 are
 we


mentioned
 is
 it
 positive
 negative
 so
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 I'm
 just
 going
 to


give
 you
 some
 highlights
 now
 this
 is
 how


much
 we're
 mentioned
 in
 a
 reg
 media
 from


2019
 up
 until
 August
 uh
 this
 year
 uh
 we


see
 a
 peak
 in
 2020


related
 to
 a
 certain
 hiring
 process
 uh


but
 other
 than
 that
 it's
 pretty
 stable


uh
 every
 year
 then
 over
 to
 external


relations
 uh
 as
 I
 said
 we
 will
 come
 back


to
 several
 times
 the
 key
 to
 this


strategy
 is
 you
 the
 employees
 in
 uh
 a


few
 years
 back
 now
 only
 three
 years
 back


we
 scrapped
 our
 guideline
 on
 speaking


engagement
 then
 you
 had
 to
 have
 Chief


approval
 line
 managers
 approval
 and


communication
 approval
 and
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 things
 you
 could
 not
 talk
 about


we
 try
 to
 change
 that
 into
 we
 encourage


more
 people
 to
 get
 uh
 on
 a
 stage
 and
 you


only
 need
 your
 line
 manager
 approval
 and


get
 it
 into
 the
 system
 so
 uh
 we
 have
 now


180
 employees
 who
 have
 completed


presentation
 skills
 uh
 training
 then
 we


have
 created
 this
 internal
 presentation


hub
 for
 all
 employees
 because
 of
 course


we
 need
 to
 do
 this
 in
 a
 efficient
 way
 we


cannot
 talk
 to
 each
 and
 every
 one
 of
 you


every
 day
 but
 on
 this
 platform
 you
 can


find
 of
 course
 the
 corporate


presentation
 but
 also
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


good
 examples
 and
 we
 will
 continue
 to


evolve
 that
 and
 build
 it
 out
 with
 other


people
 presenting
 a
 good
 presentation


that
 we
 think
 uh
 we
 sharing
 with
 the


rest
 of
 you
 so
 we
 had
 a
 strategy
 to


increase
 uh
 to
 get
 more
 people
 uh
 out
 on


stages
 uh
 because
 we
 are
 all
 ambassadors


for
 the
 fund
 we
 can
 share
 knowledge
 we


are
 experts
 within
 our
 areas
 and
 it's
 a


good
 way
 to
 to
 sh
 yeah
 to
 to
 to
 get
 more


knowledge
 out
 there
 about
 uh
 the
 fund
 in


2021
 which
 was
 of
 course
 year
 with
 still


covid
 the
 picture
 looked
 like
 that
 this


uh
 where
 CEO
 Nikolai
 uh
 presented


approximately
 half
 the
 events
 that
 we


were
 at
 now
 in
 2024
 it's
 a
 completely


different
 pictures
 and
 when
 I
 show
 this


to
 uh
 other
 organizations
 I
 see
 that
 we


stand
 out
 because
 we
 now
 have
 a
 lot
 of


spokes
 people
 out
 there
 and
 uh
 different


stages
 and
 different
 are
 UNS
 and
 that


means
 that
 we
 have
 a
 more
 robust


strategy
 uh
 going
 forward
 we
 have
 more


people
 that
 uh
 can
 share
 the
 knowledge


and
 be
 at
 that
 stage
 we
 want
 to
 be
 a


preferred
 employer
 in
 general
 uh
 but
 we


think
 we're
 pretty
 much
 good
 on
 that
 for


more
 more
 experience
 but
 we
 realized
 a


few
 years
 ago
 that
 we
 want
 to
 do
 a
 push


on
 students
 and
 young
 professionals
 so


what
 do
 we
 do
 well
 we
 have
 three
 more


than
 three
 have
 at
 least
 three
 tools


that
 we're
 going
 to
 that
 we
 want
 to
 uh


to
 share
 with
 you
 today
 the
 first
 one
 is


actually
 visiting
 where
 these
 people
 are


going
 out
 to
 universities
 but
 also


inviting
 them
 to
 us
 the
 second
 one
 is


the
 podcast
 and
 the
 third
 one
 is
 uh


social
 media
 but
 let's
 start
 with
 uh
 the


first
 thing
 University
 visits
 and
 NBI


teach
 I
 love
 talking
 to


students
 that
 was
 probably
 one
 of
 the


first
 thing
 I
 heard
 from
 Nikolai
 and
 he


really
 did
 uh
 Nikolai
 spent
 a
 lot
 of


time
 in
 the
 beginning
 uh
 of
 his
 uh
 of


his
 tenure
 here
 uh
 going
 out
 to


universities
 both
 in
 Norway
 and
 abroad


but
 especially
 in
 Norway
 and
 we
 did
 it
 a


lot
 the
 first
 years
 and
 as
 the
 chart
 you


just
 saw
 by
 Marta
 it
 looks
 a
 little
 bit


similar
 right
 uh


Nikolai
 in
 2001
 67%
 of
 all
 with
 of
 all


the
 the
 visits
 we
 did
 and
 was
 quite
 a


lot
 here
 we
 has
 we
 have
 done
 uh
 change


as
 well
 we
 want
 more
 people
 to
 be
 out


there
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 could


go
 back
 to
 visit
 their
 own
 schools
 uh


and
 talk
 about
 the
 fun
 and
 this
 is
 what


it
 looks


like
 and
 this
 is
 both
 visiting


universities
 just
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 fun


but
 it's
 is
 also
 what
 we're
 going
 to


what
 I'm
 going
 to
 touch
 upon
 now
 NB


teach
 and
 what
 is
 that
 n
 teach
 I
 mean


there's
 been
 people
 in
 the
 fun
 going
 out


to
 schools
 talking
 about
 the
 fund
 and


what
 we
 do
 for
 a
 long
 time
 but
 MBI
 teach


was
 launched
 as
 an
 initiative
 uh
 a
 few


years
 ago
 uh
 and
 in
 the
 beginning
 we
 had


a
 web
 page
 where
 schools
 could
 come
 to


us
 and
 sort
 of
 order
 your
 own


expert
 after
 a
 while
 we
 realized
 that
 we


should
 just
 turn
 that
 around
 the
 second


thing
 is
 the
 podcast
 I
 mean
 the
 podcast


wasn't
 tailor
 made
 for
 recruitment
 right


it
 was
 made
 for
 something
 something
 else


uh
 but
 it
 has
 grown
 so
 big
 that
 that
 is


one
 of
 the
 effects
 we
 get
 out
 of


it
 uh
 and
 it
 attracts
 young
 people
 as


well
 40%
 of
 our
 listeners
 are
 between
 18


and


35
 so
 uh
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 who


uh
 apply
 for
 jobs
 or
 Su
 internships
 here


uh
 actually
 caught
 us
 sort
 of
 by
 the
 by


the
 podcast
 and
 start
 to
 get
 interested


that's
 great
 uh
 now
 we
 scroll
 90
 met
 per


day
 that's
 what
 meta
 says
 that's
 about


as
 tall
 as
 the
 ATC
 Tower
 at
 Oto
 airport


every
 single
 day
 I
 mean
 no
 wor
 there


there's
 a
 reason
 why
 you
 hav't
 s
 them
 I


think
 in
 social
 media
 you
 it
 it
 really


is
 about
 going
 into
 the
 niche
 especially


with
 the
 young
 crowd
 they
 are
 they
 use


the
 YouTube
 things
 instead
 of
 using


Google
 they
 Tik
 Tok
 things
 to
 know
 how


to
 make
 food
 they
 literally
 use
 social


media
 for


everything
 now
 we
 can
 tap
 into
 that


where
 we
 can
 bring
 value
 we
 don't
 want


to
 use
 social
 media
 just
 as
 a
 outgoing


platform
 we
 want
 to
 use
 it
 as
 a
 two-way


Communication
 channel
 where
 we
 can


really
 bring
 value
 to
 people
 at
 the


other


end
 and
 that's
 what
 we've
 done


especially
 this
 year
 with
 the
 summer


interns
 takeover
 where
 that's
 the
 most


productive
 holiday
 I've
 ever
 had
 because


that
 was
 actually
 a
 record-breaking


summer
 where
 we
 had
 some
 of
 the
 best


post
 post
 or
 the
 best
 post
 that
 we've


actually
 had
 ever
 at
 NB
 and
 we've
 now


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 months
 also


have
 rolled
 up
 the
 Takeover
 effect
 into


other
 areas
 um
 what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 we


tend
 to
 get
 the
 most
 engagement
 that


we've
 ever
 had
 in
 that
 type
 of
 area


where
 we
 have
 these
 types
 of
 takeovers


so
 what
 we
 really
 want
 to
 do
 uh
 going


forward
 is
 for
 us
 to
 tap
 into
 the


Takeover
 space
 with
 even
 more
 people
 in


the
 fund
 because
 we
 see
 that
 it
 has
 an


actual
 true


effect
 now
 it's
 all
 about
 who
 you
 put
 in


front
 of
 the
 screen
 and
 when
 you
 want
 to


reach
 younger
 Target
 audence
 groups
 we


really
 want
 to
 have
 uh
 someone
 they
 can


relate
 to
 they
 want
 to
 Envision


themselves
 into
 working
 at
 MB
 so
 that's


especially
 important
 for
 the
 interns
 and


the
 graduates
 why
 we
 really
 want
 to
 push


them
 outwards
 as
 well
 now
 it's
 not
 all


coincidential
 we
 actually
 see
 a
 big


increase
 now
 especially
 this
 is
 from


Norway
 but
 that's
 also
 General
 uh
 across


the
 board
 uh
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 young


people
 coming
 into
 LinkedIn
 Nikolai


obviously
 staying
 ahead
 of
 the
 curve
 uh


by
 couple
 of
 years
 actually
 um
 however


we
 don't
 really
 see
 that
 MB
 effect
 uh


going
 into
 uh
 the
 followers
 that
 we
 have


so
 we
 still
 have
 some
 way
 to
 go
 and


that's
 why
 we
 really
 want
 you
 guys
 to
 to


help
 us
 in
 order
 to
 actually
 bring
 uh


even
 more
 people
 out
 there
 uh
 for
 us
 to


Showcase
 now
 on
 Instagram
 we


predominantly
 reach
 uh
 Norwegian
 so


about
 50%
 of
 the
 reach
 is
 Norwegian
 but


we
 also
 especially
 see
 that
 that's
 the


youngest
 Target
 groups
 of
 the
 different


three
 main
 different
 channels
 we
 have


which
 is
 LinkedIn
 YouTube
 and
 Instagram


now
 over
 to
 YouTube
 that's
 uh
 where
 we


have
 actually
 just
 5%
 uh
 of
 the


viewership
 in
 Norway
 uh
 which
 is
 quite


interesting
 95%
 International
 viewers


which
 is
 uh
 great
 we
 also
 see
 of
 course


a
 um
 a
 podcast
 effect
 there
 but
 what
 we


really
 want
 to
 tap
 into
 now
 is
 that
 we


can
 leverage
 that
 into
 having
 them
 view


other
 things
 than
 just
 the
 podcast
 as


well
 social
 media
 is
 now
 um
 that
 has


been
 a
 recent
 development
 for
 the
 fund


not
 however
 not
 really
 that
 new
 uh
 for


social
 media
 in
 general
 but
 we
 now
 see


that
 media
 and
 social
 media
 is
 super


linked
 it
 also
 means
 that
 in
 the


strategy
 25
 we
 have
 um
 set
 out
 that
 we


want
 to
 use
 social
 media
 for
 two-way


communication
 and
 we
 see
 that
 social


media
 is
 really
 the
 way
 that
 that
 works


we
 have
 great
 engagements
 and
 we
 have
 uh


great
 questions
 about
 uh
 our
 investments


as
 well
 so
 I
 I
 highly
 appreciate
 when


you
 are
 available
 for
 when
 I
 have
 uh


questions
 coming
 in
 because
 uh
 we
 see


now
 social
 media
 is
 really
 also
 a
 way
 to


kind
 of
 have
 a
 good
 media
 response
 as


well
 uh
 that
 actually
 gives
 us
 some
 new


opportunities
 so
 uh
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do


now
 further
 is
 just
 really
 taking
 MBI
 I


IM
 teach
 and
 all
 the
 uh
 great
 speaking


engagements
 that
 we
 have
 and
 just


leverage
 that
 in
 a
 totally
 new
 different


way
 where
 we
 can
 make
 a
 digital
 impact


as
 well
 as
 the
 physical
 one
 so
 we


instead
 of
 reaching
 just
 50
 people
 you


can
 reach
 500
 people
 or
 5,000
 5
 million


you
 know
 there's
 so
 much
 in
 here
 and


that's
 uh
 some
 untap
 potential
 that
 we


really
 want
 to
 highlight
 in
 the
 uh
 going


forward
 this
 is
 core
 right
 this
 is
 very


core
 of
 what
 we
 do
 so
 how
 can
 we
 use


Communications
 to
 uh
 enhance
 that


work
 okay
 the
 podcast
 uh
 started
 out
 as


something
 and
 you
 know
 when
 a
 snowball


starts
 to
 roll
 uh
 you
 don't
 really
 know


what
 how
 big
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 and
 that's


what
 happened
 with
 this
 and
 at
 the
 point


we
 started
 in
 and
 thought
 that
 it
 was


going
 to
 be
 only
 no
 region
 listening


listening
 to


it
 but
 at
 some


point
 uh
 we
 uh
 started
 to
 concure
 the


world
 so
 um
 by
 now
 it's
 like
 it's
 6.3


million
 downloads
 in
 total
 then
 you


think
 most
 of
 it
 is
 in
 Norway
 but
 it's


not
 uh
 it's
 only
 1.7
 of
 them
 inside
 this


country
 so
 it
 has
 really
 gone


Global
 and
 it's
 always
 interesting
 to


see
 what
 happened


here
 Bill
 Gates


happened
 and
 here
 Sam
 mman


happened
 what
 happened


here
 Elon
 Musk


happened
 and
 also
 the
 investment


conference
 but
 as
 you
 can
 see
 uh
 we


really
 really
 gone
 through
 the
 roof
 in


the
 US
 uh
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 which
 is


interesting
 and
 no
 one
 could
 really
 have


anticipated
 it
