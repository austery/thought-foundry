Bro,
 what
 just
 happened?


What
 just
 happened?
 We
 are
 live
 five


minutes
 early,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


finding
 out
 with
 you
 guys
 at
 the
 same


time.
 Where
 did
 this
 red
 candle
 come


from,
 bro?
 We
 had
 all
 this
 bullish


momentum
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


You
 had
 PAL
 that
 was
 bullish.
 You
 had
 D


Jameson
 Greer
 that
 was
 bullish.
 What
 the


hell
 just
 happened?


Literally
 all
 at
 once.
 Boom.
 AC
 SMB
 just


went
 red.


665
 to
 663.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 of
 holding


on.


I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 I'm
 literally


going
 live
 early
 to
 find
 out
 with
 you


guys
 what
 happened.
 Trump
 tweeted.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 All right,
 here
 we
 go.
 I


believe
 that
 China
 purposefully
 is
 not


buying
 our
 soybeans
 and
 causing


difficulty
 for
 our
 soybean
 farmers
 is
 an


economically
 hostile
 act.
 We
 are


considering
 terminating
 business
 with


China
 having
 to
 do
 with
 cooking
 oil
 and


other
 elements
 of
 trade
 as
 retribution.


As
 an
 example,
 we
 can
 easily
 produce


cooking
 oil
 ourselves.
 We
 don't
 need
 to


purchase
 it
 from
 China.


Okay.


So,


soybeans
 is
 the
 issue
 that
 Trump
 has


with
 China.


This
 is
 not
 how
 I
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 going


to
 start
 this
 market
 close.
 Dude,
 I
 I


had
 a
 whole
 different
 plan
 on
 how
 to


start
 this
 market
 close.


Let's
 see
 the
 impact
 of
 what's
 going
 on


here.
 So,
 Robin
 just
 dropped
 another


percent.
 S&P,
 look
 at
 that.
 662.


We
 recovered
 down
 1.5%


all
 the
 way
 to
 make
 it
 green.


Uh,
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 why
 that


happened,
 but
 I
 guess
 this
 Trump
 soybean


comment


goes
 the
 opposite
 direction.
 Uh,
 SoFi


still
 green,
 AMD
 still
 green,
 Grab
 was


at
 six,
 now
 it's
 back
 to
 595.
 This
 is


just
 alos,
 right?
 Everything
 gets
 hit.


Meta's
 down
 one,
 Amazon's
 down
 one


point.
 Amazon
 was
 at
 219,
 now
 back
 to


216.
 Apple
 about
 to
 go
 red.
 SMCI
 about


to
 go
 red.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum.
 There's


some
 red
 candles
 across
 the
 board.


Ethereum
 was
 at
 41.
 Now
 it's
 down
 to


4,000.


Iran
 was
 pushing
 freaking
 72.
 Where's


Iran?
 69.92.


I
 mean,
 it
 still
 might
 get
 the
 $70


close.
 We
 got
 to
 see
 how
 the
 market


interacts
 with
 this
 uh
 soybean
 news.


But,


okay.
 So,
 soybean
 soybeans
 is
 the
 issue.


Again,
 if
 you're
 just
 joining,
 Trump


says,
 "I
 believe
 that
 China
 is
 purposely


not
 buying
 our
 soybeans,
 causing


difficulty.
 We
 are
 considering


terminating
 business
 with
 China


and
 we
 will
 buy
 cooking
 oil
 ourselves.


Well,
 for
 everyone
 who
 bet
 that
 we
 were


going
 to
 close
 red
 this
 morning,


you
 were
 wrong
 for
 literally
 the
 past


three
 hours
 and
 you
 might
 end
 up
 being


right.
 Goodness
 gracious.
 2%
 down
 on
 the


S&P.
 Dude,
 I
 put
 a
 green
 thumbnail.


I
 put
 JPAL
 on
 a
 green
 thumbnail.


The
 reason
 I
 made
 it
 green
 is
 because
 we


were
 green.


I
 guess
 soybeans


are
 making
 us
 red.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 this
 is
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 being
 a
 little
 hyperbolic


here,
 but
 obviously
 equity
 prices
 are


reacting
 to
 the
 downside
 now.
 They're


not
 going
 as
 down
 as
 they
 were
 in
 the


morning.
 The
 morning
 was
 a
 whole


different
 issue.
 1.5%
 down
 on
 the
 S&P.


That
 was
 a
 bit
 nasty.
 We're
 at
 657,
 but


hopefully
 it's
 not
 as
 bad
 of
 an
 issue.


But
 that
 is
 the
 news
 update
 for
 what


we've
 got.
 Yeah,
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 nothing


burger,
 dude.
 It
 feels
 like
 ALOS,
 as


soon
 as
 Trump
 says
 anything
 about
 China,


the
 ALOS
 go
 down
 because
 they're
 afraid


that
 we're
 going to
 get
 into
 a
 full-on


trade
 war
 with
 China.
 So,
 look,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.
 But
 those


all-time
 highs
 that
 some
 of these
 stocks


were
 making,
 Iran,
 AS,
 etc.,
 might
 not


get
 that
 on
 the
 close
 with
 17
 minutes


left.


might
 not
 get
 that
 on
 the
 close
 with
 17


minutes
 left.
 All right,
 so
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what


happened
 throughout
 the
 rest
 of the
 day


regardless
 because
 we
 do
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 updates
 that
 are
 super


important
 to
 discuss.
 We
 will
 have


technical
 Tuesday
 today.
 Jason
 will
 be


on
 at
 4:20
 and
 we'll
 see
 what
 goes
 on


from
 there.
 But
 the
 breaking
 news
 right


here
 is
 Trump
 says
 China
 won't
 buy
 our


soybeans.


Um,


so
 we
 can


produce
 cooking
 oil
 ourselves.


That
 is
 the
 update
 right
 here.


I
 mean,
 there
 you
 go.


There
 you
 go.
 That's
 what
 that's
 what


you
 got
 happening.
 This
 is
 the
 tweet


right
 there
 for
 those
 that
 for
 those


that
 didn't
 see
 it.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 um,


let's
 get
 back
 into
 some
 of
 the
 other


stuff
 that
 happened
 today.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 the
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 that


happened
 today
 outside
 of
 PAL,
 which


we'll
 talk
 about
 Pal
 in
 a
 second,
 was


Jameson
 Greer.
 Jameson
 Greer
 basically


said,
 "Hey,
 the
 market
 should
 calm
 down


because
 the
 China
 issue
 is
 not
 that


serious."
 Obviously,
 based
 on
 what
 Trump


just
 said
 right
 now,
 it
 feels
 a
 little


bit
 more
 serious.
 But
 here's
 what
 Greer


said
 today
 about
 rare
 e
 rare
 uh
 earth


minerals.
 And
 then
 we'll
 go
 from
 there.


For
 the
 past
 six
 months,
 we've
 been


having
 constructive
 conversations
 with


our
 Chinese
 counterparts.
 Uh
 way
 back
 in


May
 in
 Geneva,
 Switzerland,
 we
 arrived


at
 a
 deal
 uh
 where
 we
 would
 take
 down


our
 massive
 145%
 tariffs.
 We'd
 suspend


most
 of
 those.
 And
 in
 return,
 the


Chinese
 would
 suspend
 their
 controls
 on


rare
 earth
 minerals.
 Last
 week,
 the


Chinese
 decided
 to,
 you
 know,
 re-expand


uh
 their
 controls
 on
 rare
 earth
 minerals


>> out
 of
 nowhere.


>> Uh
 I
 would
 say
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 Yeah,


that's
 right.
 I
 mean
 they
 there's
 always


some
 level
 of
 dramatics
 to
 it
 uh
 where


they
 will
 you
 know
 if
 we
 take
 measures


you
 know
 little
 measures
 here
 and
 there


they'll
 they'll
 threaten
 to
 you
 know


bring
 down
 you
 know
 hellfire
 and
 things


like
 that.
 Um
 but
 this
 is
 something
 that


is
 completely
 disproportionate
 to
 any


measures
 that
 the
 US
 has.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 they
 would
 probably


say
 well
 you're
 doing
 this
 on


semiconductors.
 Oh,
 well
 I
 mean
 listen,


every
 country
 has
 uh
 very
 specific


export
 controls
 that
 are
 product


specific,
 company
 specific,
 sometimes


country
 specific,
 and
 it's
 on
 things


that
 are
 very
 high-tech.
 What
 the


Chinese
 are
 doing
 is
 broad.
 It's
 on
 the


whole
 world,
 a
 broad
 range
 of
 products


that
 contain
 a
 tiny.1%
 of
 it
 is
 is
 is


rare
 earth
 materials.
 Um,
 and
 they're


doing
 it
 to
 low
 tech
 stuff.
 The
 rare


earth
 materials
 here,
 these
 are
 things


that
 the
 United
 States
 pioneered
 60


years
 ago.
 It's
 basic
 materials
 that


they're
 trying
 to
 control.
 But
 we
 need


>> So
 it's
 not
 like
 what
 he
 said
 was
 the


most
 bullish.
 But
 the
 reason
 the


markets,
 if
 you
 were
 watching
 the
 market


open
 when
 we
 watched
 that
 entire


interview
 live,
 did
 a
 literal
 U-turn
 and


ended
 up
 getting
 to
 that
 V-shaped


recovery
 is
 because
 the
 markets
 finally


got
 some
 clarity
 over
 what
 the
 heck
 is


happening
 with
 China.
 So
 we're
 not
 out


of
 the
 woods
 with
 China,
 but
 basically


the
 markets
 interpreted
 that
 as
 okay,


there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 some
 negotiation


that
 happens
 in
 South
 Korea
 when
 Trump


and
 Xi
 meet.
 They
 did
 confirm
 that
 they


would
 be
 meeting
 again
 and
 that
 this
 is


a
 situation
 that
 can
 be
 solved.
 It's
 not


just
 Trump
 randomly
 starting
 some
 100%


tariff
 back
 and
 forth,
 which
 is
 I
 think


the
 perception
 of
 why
 the
 markets
 fell


3%
 on
 Friday
 because
 they
 thought
 Trump


was
 just
 going
 crazy
 and
 we
 were
 getting


going
 to
 get
 these
 random
 tariffs
 from


nowhere
 again.
 Now,
 having
 said
 that,
 10


minutes
 ago
 when
 Trump
 or
 five
 minutes


ago
 when
 Trump
 tweets
 what
 he
 tweets,


you're
 getting
 back
 to
 that
 same


argument
 that
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 pick


fights.
 And
 apparently,
 even
 though


Greer
 tried
 to
 calm
 down
 the
 markets


based
 on
 this
 whole
 China
 situation,


Trump
 tweeting
 that
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to


uh
 buy
 cooking
 oil
 from
 China
 anymore


and
 that
 they're
 becoming
 hostile,
 which


again,
 you
 know,
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 that's
 just
 another
 form
 of
 Trump


probably
 trying
 to
 negotiate
 with
 the


Chinese
 before
 his
 meeting
 next
 week.


It's
 enough
 to
 get
 the
 Algos
 to
 be


upset.
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 it's
 a
 nothing


burger,
 but
 nonetheless,
 that's
 kind
 of


reversing
 what
 uh
 Jameson
 Greer
 said


today.
 So,
 obviously
 not
 out
 of
 the


woods.
 We're
 not
 as
 down
 as
 we
 were
 in


the
 morning
 when
 the
 rare
 earth
 metal


stuff
 uh
 came
 out
 from
 Reuters
 that


China
 was
 being
 a
 bit
 more
 hostile.


Greer
 kind
 of
 calmed
 people
 down.
 Trump


is
 kind
 of
 escalating
 here
 saying
 that


China's
 not
 buying
 our
 soybeans,
 which


is
 an
 issue.
 This
 is
 almost
 exactly
 what


happened
 in
 2018
 and
 it
 kind
 of
 messed


up
 Q4.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 happens
 this


time
 because
 the
 Fed's
 not
 hiking
 like


they
 were
 back
 then
 and
 earnings
 are


going to
 be
 way
 better
 than
 they
 were
 in


2018
 Q4.
 But
 the
 government
 shutdown


happened
 in
 Q4
 2018
 and
 the
 China


soybean
 issue
 happened.
 So
 we
 have
 two


of
 the
 same
 things
 that
 happened
 six


years
 ago
 and
 you
 know
 ultimately
 we're


going
 to
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out
 going
 into


the
 end
 of the
 year.
 But
 obviously
 we've


got
 a
 massive
 Fed
 easing
 tailwind
 and
 an


AI
 tailwind
 that's
 different.
 Speaking


of
 the
 Fed,
 so
 JPA,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 story


I
 was
 going
 to
 lead
 with
 today,
 but
 then


soybeans
 got
 into
 the
 picture.
 Uh
 JPAL


was
 pretty
 bullish,
 dude.
 Here's
 what


JPAL
 said.
 Number
 one,
 the
 data
 is


showing
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 largely


where
 it
 was
 in
 September.
 The
 data


before
 the
 shutdown
 suggests
 growth
 may


be
 better
 than
 expected.
 And
 number


three,
 the
 labor
 market
 weakness


justified
 the
 September
 rate
 cut.
 Before


I
 left
 on
 the
 market
 open,
 my
 simple


analysis
 of
 what
 JPA
 would
 say
 would
 be


labor
 market
 weak
 means
 more
 rate
 cuts.


And
 basically
 what
 he
 said
 for
 50


minutes
 in
 his
 Q&A
 is,
 hey,
 the
 labor


market
 is
 showing
 weakness,
 which
 means


we're
 likely
 going
 to
 get
 some
 rate


cuts.
 Nvidia
 down
 4%
 because
 of


soybeans,
 not
 because
 of
 JPL,
 because
 of


soybeans,
 but
 Nvidia's
 down
 4%
 right


here.
 Now,
 the
 most
 bullish
 thing
 that


JP
 Pal
 said,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 like


the
 real
 reason
 we
 had
 a
 a
 phenomenal


V-shaped
 recovery
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 until
 the
 soybean
 stuff,
 is
 that
 Pal


basically
 said
 we
 might
 come
 to
 an
 end


of
 quantitative
 tightening
 of
 QT.


Federal
 Chair
 Jerome
 Pal
 said
 the


central
 bank
 is
 nearing
 a
 point
 where
 it


will
 stop
 reducing
 the
 size
 of
 its
 bond


holdings
 aka
 selling
 off
 assets
 on
 the


balance
 sheet
 which
 would
 inevitably


even
 if
 we
 don't
 start
 buying
 bonds


which
 would
 be
 you
 know
 direct
 QE
 if
 we


stop
 selling
 bonds
 and
 we
 stop


quantitative
 tending
 and
 we've
 already


stopped
 the
 pace
 of
 how
 dramatic
 it
 was


back
 in
 2022
 it
 would
 be
 a
 form
 of


quantitative
 easing
 which
 is
 really
 good


when
 you
 pair
 that
 with
 rate
 cuts
 does


that
 create
 a
 bubble
 maybe
 but
 we'll
 see


that
 when
 we
 get
 to
 that
 but


quantitative
 easing
 and
 rates
 going
 down


means
 asset
 prices
 likely
 go
 up.
 And


that
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 story
 I
 was
 going


to
 leave
 with
 today.
 But
 then
 we
 got
 the


soybean
 news.
 So
 I
 mean,
 look,
 that
 the


soybean
 stuff
 doesn't
 change
 that
 macro


trend
 for
 what
 JPL
 said
 today,
 which
 is


incredibly
 bullish.
 But
 nonetheless,


you've
 got
 this.3%


draw
 down
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 based
 on
 what


Trump
 just
 said.
 Let's
 get
 some
 coverage


right
 here
 on
 the
 soybean
 stuff
 and
 then


we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 what
 JPAL
 said.


But,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 compliment


JPAL
 for
 being
 such
 a
 QT
 for
 starting
 to


get
 back
 into
 QE,
 but
 the
 soybeans
 kind


of
 messed
 that
 up


>> because
 the
 president
 is
 talking
 about


China
 on
 social
 media.
 Here's
 what
 he


posted.
 He
 says,
 "I
 believe
 that
 China


purposely
 not
 buying
 our
 soybeans
 and


causing
 difficulty
 for
 our
 soybean


farmers
 is
 an
 economically
 hostile
 act.


We
 are
 considering
 terminating
 business


with
 China,
 having
 to
 do
 with
 cooking


oil
 and
 other
 elements
 of
 trade
 as


retribution.
 as
 an
 example,
 we
 can


easily
 produce
 cooking
 oil
 ourselves.
 We


don't
 need
 to
 purchase
 it
 uh
 from
 China.


Note
 that
 word
 considering
 there,
 Scott,


because
 even
 though
 there's
 been
 a
 lot


of
 intense
 rhetoric
 from
 President
 Trump


and
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Besson
 over
 the


past
 four
 days,
 the
 thing
 to
 focus
 on
 is


what
 hasn't
 happened,
 which
 is
 any


action
 actually
 to
 raise
 tariffs
 or
 to


retaliate
 concretely.
 You
 saw
 that
 word


considering
 the
 retaliation
 there
 in
 the


social
 media
 post.
 Now,
 I'm
 told
 that


that's
 part
 of
 an
 intentional
 effort
 by


the
 US
 to
 manage
 through
 this
 situation.


So,
 even
 as
 tensions
 are
 rising,
 the
 US


action
 here
 has
 been
 proportional
 to
 the


Chinese
 action.
 And
 because
 the
 Chinese


have
 so
 far
 threatened
 to
 impose
 export


controls
 on
 rare
 earths,
 but
 not
 yet


actually
 done
 it.
 The
 US
 retaliation


remains
 in
 the
 realm
 of
 hypothetical
 for


now,
 too.
 Now,
 that
 means
 there's
 still


a
 way
 to
 dial
 back
 from
 this
 relatively


quickly
 if
 the
 two
 sides
 can
 find
 an


offramp.
 One
 point
 a
 senior


administration
 official
 made
 to
 me


today,
 the
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of
 Commerce


they
 feel
 has
 taken
 a
 much
 more


aggressive
 role
 in
 the
 negotiations
 than


the
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of
 Foreign
 Affairs,


which
 has
 been
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 for


the
 flare
 up.
 US
 officials
 are
 concerned


that
 some
 in
 the
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of


Commerce
 are
 adopting
 a
 more
 hostile


style
 of
 diplomacy
 known
 as
 the
 wolf


warrior
 ethos.
 One
 person
 who's
 getting


a
 lot
 of
 attention
 in
 that
 regard,


Scott,
 is
 Lee
 Chengong,
 the
 Chinese
 vice


minister
 of
 commerce.
 You
 see
 him
 here.


He's
 said
 to
 be
 one
 of the
 most


aggressive
 officials
 on
 the
 Chinese
 side


of
 these
 negotiations
 and
 a
 potential


disruptor
 or
 uh
 problem
 in
 these
 talks,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 uh
 to
 the
 US
 side


that
 all
 of
 the
 Chinese
 officials
 are


adopting
 this
 approach.
 And
 so
 that


raises
 the
 question
 of
 how
 much
 of
 this


Chinese
 this
 is
 Chinese
 domestic


politics
 playing
 out
 and
 how
 much
 of
 it


is
 an
 intentional
 good
 cop
 bad
 cop


strategy.
 US
 officials
 see
 the
 trade


truce
 since
 the
 talks
 in
 Geneva
 this


summer
 as
 fragile
 but
 stable
 despite
 the


rhetoric
 of
 the
 past
 four
 days
 and
 for


now
 the
 betting
 in
 Washington
 is
 that


face-to-face
 meeting
 between
 President


Trump
 and
 Xiinping
 will
 actually
 happen


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 Scott.
 So
 some


insight
 into
 imagine
 getting
 liquidated


over
 soybeans


over
 soybeans.


There
 you
 go.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 not


that
 dramatic
 of
 a
 red
 candle,
 but
 I


think
 this
 is
 more
 so
 annoying
 to
 market


participants
 that
 thought
 this
 China


stuff
 is
 not
 over,
 but
 it
 wouldn't


escalate
 to
 to
 to
 the
 point
 where


soybeans
 gets
 into
 the
 conversation


again.
 But
 there
 you
 go.
 Now,
 again,
 as


as
 he
 just
 said,
 Xi
 and
 Trump
 are
 going


to
 be
 meeting
 next
 week
 in
 Korea.
 So,


they
 will
 be
 having
 a
 conversation.


Trump
 might
 be
 putting
 this
 stuff
 out,


not
 really
 caring
 about
 how
 the
 market's


going
 to
 react,
 but
 more
 so
 caring
 about


um
 getting
 leverage
 and
 using
 soybeans


as
 leverage.
 And
 Jameson
 Greer
 did
 uh


say
 this
 morning
 that
 China
 realized


that
 they
 got
 too
 aggressive
 with
 their


rare
 earth
 exports
 and
 um
 and
 export


controls
 and
 they
 pulled
 back
 some
 of


their
 statements
 on
 Saturday
 night,


which
 he
 was
 right
 about.
 The
 the


Ministry
 of
 Finance
 in
 China
 came
 out


and
 basically
 said
 we
 we
 don't
 want
 to


escalate
 this
 to
 that
 extent,
 which
 is


why
 the
 market
 started
 U-turning
 at
 12


p.m.
 because
 they
 were
 like,
 "All
 right,


both
 sides
 want
 to
 get
 a
 negotiating
 uh


conclusion
 to
 what's
 going
 on
 right


now."
 But
 now
 when
 you
 put
 soybeans
 into


the
 conversation,
 that
 changes
 some
 of


the
 dynamics.
 So,
 S&P
 500
 right
 there,


662.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 not
 down
 as
 much


as
 it
 was,
 but
 it
 was
 pretty
 damn
 green


before
 we
 got
 this
 announcement.
 And
 I


guess
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 take
 a


couple
 days
 to
 see
 how
 the
 market
 reacts


to
 this,
 what
 China
 says
 to
 this.
 I


mean,
 now
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 unknowns
 that


we
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 in
 regards
 to
 the


broader
 market.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 still


down
 4%,
 potentially
 going
 back
 below


180
 right
 there.
 Pounder
 is
 still
 up
 1%.


It
 was
 at
 180.
 Tesla
 was
 at
 435.
 That's


back
 down
 to
 1.7.
 And
 then
 Robin
 Hood


was
 at
 141
 right
 before
 this
 came
 out.


now
 down
 to
 13539.


This
 is
 very
 fatiguing.
 This
 is
 indeed


fatiguing,
 but
 this
 is
 the
 nature
 of


investing
 uh
 in
 this
 administration.


Again,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,


Trump
 said,
 "I
 believe
 that
 China


purposely
 not
 buying
 our
 soybeans
 is
 an


economically
 hostile
 act.
 We
 are


considering
 terminating
 business
 with


China
 having
 to
 do
 with
 cooking
 oil."


I'm
 going
 to
 Google
 real
 quick
 how
 much


cooking
 oil
 does
 the
 US
 buy
 from
 China.


I
 didn't
 know
 it
 was
 that
 much.


1.27
 million
 metric
 tons.


We
 account
 for
 43%
 of
 China's
 total


cooking
 oil
 exports
 every
 year.
 Holy


crap,
 dude.


Well,
 now
 we
 know
 why
 Trump
 mentioned


cooking
 oil.
 We're
 we're
 almost
 half
 the


entire
 cooking
 oil
 that
 China
 exports


across
 the
 world.


Seems
 like
 a
 lot.
 So,
 it
 looks
 like


that's
 why
 he's
 choosing
 that
 to
 uh
 to


make
 his
 claim.
 Why
 can't
 he
 say
 this


after
 the
 market
 close?
 You
 know what?


I'd
 rather
 he
 does
 it
 before
 the
 market


close.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 rip


the
 band-aid
 off
 and
 not
 let
 us
 have
 a


green
 day,
 you
 might
 as
 well
 just
 do
 it


before
 4
 p.m.
 versus
 take
 our
 hearts
 out


after
 hours.
 But
 regardless,
 it
 has
 been


a
 good
 day
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 names.
 Look,
 as


got
 to
 freaking
 $99.
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 95


right
 now,
 but
 that's
 still
 up at
 5%.


Ren,
 I
 mean,
 congratulations
 to
 those


that
 are
 in
 the
 stock.
 Hit
 7230.


Muckabe,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Um,
 I
 saw
 some
 screenshots
 from


Muckabe
 today
 in
 my
 DMs.
 Let's
 just
 say


he
 basically
 took
 60,000
 and
 turned
 it


into
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 60,000.
 We're


talking
 about
 seven
 figures
 from
 60,000


because
 of
 Iren.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 this
 stock


has
 created
 literally
 millionaires.
 It


has
 been
 in
 a
 phenomenal
 name.
 It


continued
 to
 go
 higher
 throughout
 the


entire
 day.
 That's
 up
 8%
 now.
 It
 was
 at


72.
 Probably
 would
 have
 closed
 above
 70


if
 it
 weren't
 for
 the
 soybean
 thing.
 But


I
 ran
 having
 a
 great
 day.
 SLG
 that
 was


up.
 TFC
 that
 was
 up.
 The
 banks
 again


completely
 crushed
 it.
 Wells
 Fargo
 had


one
 of the
 best
 days
 for
 all
 the
 banks.


Wells
 Fargo
 right
 there
 that's
 up
 7%
 on


the
 day.
 Again,
 it
 was
 a
 really
 good
 day


in
 regards
 to
 the
 banks,
 in
 regards
 to


Jameson
 Greer.
 And
 then
 in
 regards
 to


what
 Powell
 said,
 it's
 just
 this
 last


minute
 notification
 on
 the
 soybeans
 is


kind
 of
 what
 messed
 up
 the
 the
 green


close.
 But
 overall,
 absolutely


incredible.
 And
 uh
 again,
 it's
 as
 as
 as


Makabe
 says
 right
 there,
 it's
 very


humbling
 to
 go
 from
 60,000
 to
 multiple


seven
 figures
 off
 one
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 and


you
 deserve
 it
 when
 you
 do
 the
 due


diligence
 and
 you
 get
 in
 so
 early
 into
 a


name
 like
 this.
 But
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 how


great
 the
 demand
 is
 obviously
 for
 AI


data
 centers.
 That's
 why
 I
 rent
 is


running
 and
 also
 how
 much
 the
 market


wants
 to
 continue
 pulling
 forward
 the


multiple
 because
 they
 think
 that
 growth


is
 going
 to
 be
 there.
 SoFi
 as
 well
 2778.


SoFi
 was
 pushing
 29
 before
 that
 soybean


announcement
 came
 out.
 SoFi
 right
 there


now
 at
 2777.
 I
 mean,
 you
 had
 a
 day
 where


someone
 literally
 bet
 $500
 on
 Kshi
 if


JPAL
 would
 cough.
 He
 would
 win
 $500
 if


JPAL
 would
 cough.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 in


this
 video
 right
 here,
 JPAL
 coughed
 and


this
 guy
 won
 500
 bucks.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 a
 pretty
 exciting
 day
 across
 the


board.
 Exciting
 day
 across
 the
 board.


JPAL
 gave
 us
 some
 pretty
 bullish


statements,
 but
 you
 know,
 now
 we
 have
 to


navigate
 this
 soybean
 stuff.
 This
 is
 the


world.
 world
 the
 prediction
 markets
 are


taking
 us
 into.
 Dude,
 this
 is
 the


freaking
 world
 the
 prediction
 markets


are
 taking
 us
 into.
 Walmart
 had
 a


massive
 day
 chatp
 instant
 checkout
 for


Walmart.
 So
 the
 partnership
 with
 OpenAI


that
 also
 helped
 Walmart.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot


of
 these
 companies
 if
 you're
 able
 to


partner
 with
 Open
 AAI,
 I
 mean
 at
 this


point
 Nvidia
 should
 just
 announce


something
 with
 OpenAI
 every
 freaking


week
 and
 that
 will
 continue
 to
 help


their
 stock.
 But
 Walmart
 instant


checkout
 with
 OpenAI.
 Same
 thing
 that


Shopify
 said.
 I
 mean
 look
 at
 Walmart.


It's
 up
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Walmart's
 not
 a


stock
 that
 really
 moves
 five,
 seven


percent
 a
 day.
 It's
 moving
 5%
 based
 on


AI
 integrations
 on
 checking
 out
 and
 that


was
 really
 good
 for
 Walmart.
 So
 yeah,


that's
 getting
 some
 momentum.
 And
 then


you
 had
 this
 from
 the
 senior
 vice


president
 of
 Apple
 in
 marketing
 posted


this.
 Um
 I
 would
 love
 to
 know
 what
 you


guys
 think
 it
 could
 be.
 It
 kind
 of
 looks


like
 a
 laptop,
 but
 maybe
 it's
 more
 than


a
 laptop.
 I
 mean,
 no,
 it's
 definitely
 a


laptop.
 I
 was
 thinking
 for
 a
 second,


maybe
 it's
 a
 foldable
 phone,
 but
 it's


probably
 a
 laptop.
 So,
 looks
 like
 the


new
 either
 M5
 chip
 or
 MacBook
 series
 are


getting
 ready
 to
 come
 out
 and
 Apple


likely
 will
 be
 hosting
 an
 event
 to
 talk


about
 that
 in
 the
 coming
 weeks.
 Apple


right
 there
 247.


That
 one
 also
 losing
 250
 based
 on
 uh


based
 on
 the
 soybean
 tweet.
 Prolithic


says,
 "I
 won
 the
 one
 gram
 gold
 bars
 from


Robin
 Hood."
 Wow,
 congrats.
 Uh
 I
 forgot


they
 were
 doing
 that
 giveaway
 last


month.
 Um
 so,
 if
 you
 were
 a
 winner
 of


gold
 bar,
 congratulations.
 Super
 awesome


stuff.
 I
 mean,
 gold
 continues
 to
 do
 its


thing.
 Gold
 hit
 a
 new
 all-time
 high


today,
 4158
 on
 the
 day
 right
 now.
 Silver


as
 well
 still
 above
 50.
 So
 you
 are
 still


seeing
 silver
 is
 actually
 a
 little
 red


on
 the
 day,
 but
 gold
 is
 green.
 Gold
 and


silver
 are
 not
 slowing
 down.
 Paul
 Tudtor


Jones
 came
 out.
 Remember
 last
 week
 he


said
 it
 kind
 of
 feels
 like
 a
 bubble
 or


there's
 a
 resemblance
 of
 a
 bubble.
 He


came
 out
 today
 and
 he
 said
 two
 things.


Number
 one,
 he
 said
 the
 NASDAQ
 will
 be


significantly
 higher
 between
 now
 and
 end


of
 year.
 Bullish.
 Number
 two,
 he
 said,


"I
 think
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate,
 aka


interest
 rates,
 will
 be
 two
 and
 a
 half


to
 2.75%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year."
 Oil


prices,
 by
 the
 way,
 WTI
 crew
 down
 about


1.7%.


I
 mean,
 if
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones
 is
 thinking


the
 NASDAQ's
 going
 to
 be
 higher
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 and
 he
 thinks
 rates
 are


going to
 get
 get
 basically
 cut
 in
 half


by
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year,
 obviously,


you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 market
 that
 feels


a
 bit
 more
 excited
 about
 uh
 the


potential
 for
 risk
 on
 assets
 and
 as
 a


result,
 you're
 getting
 some
 momentum.


Last
 thing
 before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 market


close,
 we
 got
 about
 20
 seconds.
 Sam


Altman
 said
 today
 that
 they
 are
 working


on
 building
 out
 more
 of
 their
 data


centers
 uh
 to
 support
 and
 for
 those
 that


didn't
 hear
 it,
 uh
 this
 might
 be
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 shocker
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 You
 might
 be
 a
 bit
 surprised,


but
 nonetheless,
 this
 is
 probably
 going


to
 be
 the
 biggest
 use
 case
 of
 AI
 to
 an


extent.
 A
 erotica
 for
 adult
 users.
 So


Sam
 Alman
 explicitly
 said,
 "Hey,
 uh
 we


see
 that
 this
 is
 high
 in
 demand
 and
 we


are
 working
 hard
 on
 building
 out
 our


GPUs
 and
 our
 data
 centers
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 can
 serve
 erotica
 to
 uh
 to
 adult


users.
 Having
 said
 that,
 Tuesday,


October
 14th,
 4
 p.m.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 the
 stock
 market.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 take
 Nvidia
 to
 the
 literal


moon.
 Take
 if
 Sam
 Alman
 is
 I
 mean,
 if


that's
 if
 he
 thinks
 that's
 one
 of the


biggest
 verticals
 of
 AI
 to
 go
 after,


we're
 taking
 Nvidia
 to
 the
 moon.
 I
 guess


we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 It's
 It's
 It's
 kind


of
 crazy,
 bro.
 But
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the


headlines
 from
 an
 AI
 perspective
 today.


And
 like
 Sam
 Alman
 literally
 tweeted


that.
 So
 it
 wasn't
 like
 misqued
 by
 some


report.
 It
 was
 literally
 announced


today.
 And
 uh
 it
 was
 in
 the
 context
 of


like
 trying
 to
 deal
 with
 mental
 health


for
 ChatBT,


but
 he
 went
 on
 further
 to
 talk
 about
 all


the
 other
 things
 that
 they
 are
 getting


ready
 to
 to
 put
 out.
 So
 that's
 what
 we


got.
 Again,
 if
 you
 are
 just
 joining,
 the


main
 headline
 of
 the
 day
 is
 not
 what


JPal
 said.
 It's
 not
 what
 Jameson
 Greer


said.
 It
 is
 Trump
 10
 minutes
 before
 the


market
 closed
 saying
 that
 I
 believe


China
 is
 not
 buying
 our
 soybeans
 and
 as


a
 result
 we
 want
 to
 counter
 by
 not


buying
 their
 cooking
 oil.
 The
 United


States
 is
 almost
 50%
 of
 China's
 cooking


oil
 exports
 which
 is
 likely
 why
 Trump


mentioned
 this
 and
 as
 a
 result
 it
 looks


like
 this
 trade
 war
 potentially
 is


escalating.
 I
 mean
 I
 guess
 we'll
 hear


what
 China
 says
 later
 but
 the
 market


definitely
 acted
 like
 it
 was
 escalating


in
 the
 last
 10
 minutes
 of
 the
 day.
 So


that
 is
 what
 we've
 got.
 All right.
 How


did
 the
 market
 end?
 Robin
 Hood
 13544.


That
 was
 down
 about
 3.72%


on
 the
 day.
 Palanteer
 right
 here
 17957.


That
 was
 down
 about
 1.3%.
 Tesla
 1.4%.
 If


you
 heard
 a
 sound
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


market
 close,
 it
 was
 probably
 the
 Robin


Hood
 sound.
 It
 does
 this
 like
 opening


sound,
 closing
 sound
 when
 the
 market


opens
 or
 market
 closes.
 So
 that's


probably
 the
 sound
 you
 heard
 when
 uh


when
 the
 market
 closes
 at
 4
 p.m.
 Nvidia


right
 there,
 180.
 That
 was
 down
 4%.
 S&P


only
 ended
 down
 0.0.
 08%
 but


unfortunately
 could
 not
 go
 green
 based


on
 that
 soybean
 quote
 was
 at
 665
 went


all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 662
 but
 I
 mean
 it


was
 better
 from
 6
 uh
 what
 was
 it
 657


in
 the
 morning
 so
 you
 did
 get
 a
 bit
 of a


rebound
 or
 653
 it
 got
 to
 AMD
 218
 that


ended
 green
 soi
 that's
 up
 2.6%
 on
 the


day
 that
 was
 green
 Google
 was
 down
 about


half
 a
 percent
 down
 about
 3.6%
 6%


Amazon.
 I
 did
 buy
 more
 Amazon
 today.
 I'm


continuing
 to
 DCA
 into
 Amazon.
 I
 mean,


we've
 been
 through
 the
 thesis
 for
 a


while,
 but
 Amazon
 below
 220
 to
 me
 is
 a


buy.
 So,
 I
 bought
 more
 at
 217
 today.


Meta
 right
 there
 708.
 That's
 down.


Salesforce
 was
 down
 4%.
 Salesforce


announced
 a
 freaking
 OpenAI
 partnership


and
 they
 could
 not
 get
 their
 stock
 to


move.
 Unfortunately,
 everyone
 can
 get


their
 stock
 to
 move
 if
 they
 say
 they're


working
 with
 OpenAI,
 not
 Salesforce.
 So,


they
 announced
 like
 some
 multi-year


enterprise


um
 addition
 to
 what
 they're
 already


doing
 with
 with
 OpenAI
 stock


unfortunately
 fell
 4%.
 PayPal
 was


actually
 green
 on
 the
 day
 6915.
 Apple


was
 down.
 SMTI
 was
 down.
 Ethereum
 4100.


Bitcoin
 at
 112.
 Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 that


Bitcoin
 guy
 who
 was
 uh
 doing
 the
 short,


the
 same
 guy
 who
 did
 the
 short
 after
 or


right
 before
 the
 Trump
 Truth
 Social
 post


on
 China,
 which
 allowed
 him
 to
 make
 $200


million,
 he
 closed
 the
 short.
 He
 closed


the
 short.
 He
 literally
 closed
 the
 short


right
 when
 I
 ended
 the
 market
 open.
 and


I
 got
 the
 notification
 that
 he
 closed


the
 short.
 And
 so,
 I
 mean,
 that's
 pretty


bullish,
 right,
 that
 he
 ended
 up
 closing


the
 short,
 but
 so
 far,
 we
 have
 not
 seen


him
 uh
 open
 the
 short.
 Let
 me
 show
 you


guys
 the
 post
 right
 here
 of
 him
 closing.


He
 closed
 it,
 I
 think,
 at
 114ish.


So,
 there
 you
 go.
 That
 was
 the
 close
 of


the
 short
 and
 or
 at
 112
 he
 closed
 it.
 I


think
 he
 made
 he
 made
 some
 good
 money
 on


it
 uh
 because
 he
 started
 at
 116.
 But


even
 he
 probably
 heard
 what
 Jameson


Greer
 had
 to
 say
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Hey,


I
 don't
 want
 to
 short
 this
 if
 the
 China


thing
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal."
 I


mean,
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 guy's
 head,
 but
 I


would
 imagine
 that's
 probably
 what
 he


was
 thinking.
 And
 then
 boom,
 you
 get


this
 Trump
 tweet
 right
 at
 the
 market


close,
 which
 you
 would
 think
 if
 he
 was


the
 guy
 who
 knew
 that
 the
 Trump
 tweet


was
 coming,
 he
 would
 get
 the
 intel
 that


another
 Trump
 tweet
 was
 coming.
 But
 I


guess
 his
 plug
 wasn't
 able
 to
 deliver


him
 the
 soybean
 notification
 before
 it


came
 out.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 kind
 of


had
 the
 market
 to
 get.


It's
 Baron
 Trump.
 It
 might
 be
 Baron


Trump.
 It
 might
 be.
 It
 was
 You
 emit.


Dude,
 I
 I
 mean,
 $200
 million,
 bro.
 That


is
 crazy.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 do


perpetual
 futures
 contracts.
 I've
 never


even
 signed
 up
 to
 a
 platform
 that
 like


allows
 me
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 but
 the
 point


is
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 JPAL,
 I
 think,


was
 the
 most
 bullish
 thing
 that
 happened


uh
 this
 morning.
 It's
 just
 that
 soybean


stuff
 kind
 of
 changed
 it.
 So,
 again,


what
 did
 JPL
 say?
 We
 talked
 about
 it
 for


a
 little
 bit,
 but
 the
 most
 important


thing
 he
 talked
 about
 was
 the
 balance


sheet.
 And
 essentially
 Japow
 made
 the


argument
 that
 the
 risk
 of
 continuing


contracting
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet
 aka


quantitative
 tightening
 is
 not
 something


they
 want
 to
 engage
 in
 at
 the
 level
 at


what
 they
 were
 doing
 before.
 And
 as
 a


result
 you
 had
 the
 markets
 immediately


interpret
 that
 as
 pretty
 bullish.
 And


that
 kind
 of
 changed
 the
 perspective
 on


what
 the
 markets
 were
 thinking
 about.
 So


let
 me
 pull
 up
 this
 uh


this
 clip
 right
 here
 where
 JPA
 is


talking
 about
 that
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 All right,
 we
 got


technical
 Tuesday
 in
 about
 15
 minutes


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 Jason
 on
 in
 start


getting
 into
 TA.


>> That
 tumultuous
 period,
 we
 continued
 to


purchase
 in
 order
 to
 avoid
 a
 sharp


unwelcome
 tightening
 of
 financial


conditions
 at
 a
 time
 when
 the
 economy


still
 appeared
 to
 be
 highly
 vulnerable.


Our
 thinking
 was,
 pardon
 me,
 was


informed
 by
 recent
 episodes
 in
 which


signals
 about


>> that
 was
 the
 cough
 by
 the
 way
 that
 that


made
 someone
 $500
 on
 call
 she
 betting
 on


JP
 coughing
 at least
 once.
 Reducing
 the


balance
 sheet
 had
 triggered
 significant


tightening
 in
 financial
 conditions
 and


we
 were
 thinking
 of
 the
 events
 of


December
 2018
 as
 well
 as
 the
 2013
 taper


tantrum.


Regarding
 the
 composition
 of
 our


purchases,
 some
 have
 questioned
 the


inclusion
 of
 agency
 MBS
 purchases
 given


the
 strong
 housing
 market
 during
 the


pandemic
 recovery.
 Outside
 of
 purchases


aimed
 specifically
 at
 market


functioning,
 MBS
 purchases
 are
 primarily


intended
 like
 our
 purchases
 of
 treasury


securities
 to
 ease
 broader
 financial


conditions
 when
 the
 policy
 rate
 is


constrained
 by
 the
 effective
 lower


bound.


>> And
 then
 this
 was
 JPAL
 talking
 about
 why


they
 made
 the
 decision
 they
 made
 in


September


>> decisions
 uh
 according
 to
 the
 FOMC


schedule.
 But
 I
 think
 uh
 it
 will
 be
 a


lot
 better
 once
 we
 start
 getting
 for


example,
 you
 know,
 the
 September


employment
 report
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very


important
 report
 and
 we
 we're
 not
 on


track
 to
 have
 that.
 We
 there
 would
 still


be
 time
 for
 us
 to
 get
 that.
 We
 will
 get


of
 course
 the
 the
 uh
 September
 inflation


the
 CPI
 and
 PPI
 reports.
 So
 that's
 a


that's
 a
 positive,
 but
 you
 know,
 we're


uh
 we
 don't
 comment
 on
 fiscal
 matters,


but
 from
 our
 standpoint
 uh
 we'll
 start


to
 miss
 that
 data
 and
 particularly
 the


October
 data.
 if
 this
 goes
 on
 for
 a


while,
 they
 won't
 be
 collecting
 it
 and


it
 could
 become
 more
 challenging.


>> Uh
 you
 use
 the
 term
 gold
 standard
 and


you
 didn't
 mean
 it
 in
 this
 context,
 but


I'm
 going
 to
 pivot
 here
 because
 there's


a
 question
 from
 the
 from
 the
 audience


that's
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 up
 votes.
 Uh
 so


one
 of
 your
 predecessors,
 Ellen


Greenspan,
 used
 to
 view
 the
 price
 of


gold
 as
 an
 indicator
 of
 inflation
 risk.


So
 in
 that
 context,
 how
 do
 you
 view
 the


rally
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 gold?
 And
 if


you
 want
 to
 throw
 in
 Bitcoin,
 you
 can


comment
 on
 that
 too.


I
 I
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 comment
 on


any
 particular
 asset
 price
 uh
 including


that
 one
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 we
 think
 of


of
 uh
 inflation
 as
 driven
 by
 you
 know


fundamental
 supply
 and
 demand
 uh
 factors


and
 uh
 it's
 not
 something
 we
 look
 at
 you


know
 actively.


>> So
 JP
 didn't
 give
 us
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 he


thinks
 gold
 is
 going
 higher.
 Again
 the


sort
 of
 gut
 check
 most
 people
 do
 when


they
 think
 gold
 goes
 higher
 is
 that


inflation
 expectations
 are
 going
 higher.


The
 problem
 is
 the
 10ear
 is
 going
 lower


and
 the
 10ear
 should
 be
 going
 higher.


Aka
 people
 should
 be
 selling
 off


treasuries
 if
 they
 think
 inflation's


going
 higher
 because
 they
 want
 to
 get


more
 bang
 for
 their
 buck
 and
 that's
 the


credit
 market's
 way
 of
 saying
 we
 don't


want
 to
 lock
 in
 a
 4%
 rate
 for
 10
 years.


We
 want
 to
 get
 4.1
 or
 4.07
 because
 we


think
 inflation
 is
 going to
 be
 higher


and
 we
 want
 to
 beat
 the
 rate
 of


inflation.
 So
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 weird,


right?
 Gold
 is
 going
 up,
 which
 usually


signals
 a
 hedge
 against
 inflation,
 but


the
 10-year
 is
 going
 down,
 which
 signals


that
 the
 bond
 market
 thinks
 that
 there's


not
 that
 much
 of
 a
 risk
 of
 inflation.


And
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 the
 fact
 that
 AI


could
 be
 massively
 deflationary
 over
 the


next
 10
 years
 could
 be
 something
 that


they're
 factoring
 in.
 But
 it
 is
 a
 little


weird
 the
 dichotomy
 between
 why
 gold's


moving
 up
 and
 why
 the
 10
 years
 is
 moving


down.
 You
 would
 think
 both
 would
 move
 in


the
 right
 direction
 if
 they
 both


believed
 inflation
 was
 coming
 down
 or


both
 believed
 inflation
 was
 coming
 up.


But
 there
 are
 different
 perspectives


from
 that.
 And
 Bitcoin
 112.5.
 I
 mean,


Bitcoin
 even
 holding
 above
 100,000
 is


still
 pretty
 damn
 good
 given
 that
 it


fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 106
 on
 Friday.
 So,


you
 do
 have
 a
 rebound,
 but
 it
 is
 down


from
 116


that
 it
 was
 yesterday.
 Uh,
 Unid
 has
 a


good
 comment
 right
 here.
 He
 says,
 "Aid,


can
 you
 speak
 about
 why
 PTG,
 Howard


Marks,
 and
 JPAL
 all
 changed
 their
 views


suddenly
 and
 around
 the
 same
 time?"
 Now


look,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones,
 I


I
 I
 can't
 really
 speak
 for
 him
 because
 I


mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 think


he's
 he
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones
 believes
 that


there
 will
 be
 a
 bubble.
 He
 thinks
 we're


in
 the
 the
 early
 signs
 of
 a
 bubble.
 So,


he's
 not
 actually
 changing
 his
 views


when
 he
 thinks
 that
 the
 NASDAQ
 is
 going


to
 increase
 significantly
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 and
 that
 rates
 are
 going
 to


come
 down
 significantly.
 I
 think
 he's


basically
 feeding
 into
 the
 narrative


that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 bubble,


right?
 Because
 you're
 going
 to
 have


really
 low
 rates,
 you're
 going
 to
 have


the
 Fed
 quantitative
 easing,
 you're


going to
 have
 the
 NASDAQ
 going
 up.


That's
 kind
 of
 how
 20
 1999
 2000
 played


out.
 At least
 that's
 how
 he's
 described


it.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 necessarily


changing
 his
 tone
 right
 there.
 JPAL,
 you


know,
 JPL
 is
 looking
 at
 the
 labor
 market


and
 realizing
 they
 have
 no
 choice
 but
 to


cut
 in
 rates.
 The
 Howard
 Marx
 pivot
 is


the
 most
 surprising
 pivot
 to
 me.
 And
 I


kind
 of
 have
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 Markx


might
 have
 pivoted.
 And
 I
 don't
 want
 to


speak
 for
 Marks,
 but
 if
 you
 guys
 want
 to


hear
 my
 tinfoil
 hat
 theory,
 uh,


Brookfield
 bought
 out
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of


Oak
 Tree
 Capital
 yesterday.
 And
 I
 found


that
 out
 late
 last
 night.


So,
 I
 mean,
 Howard
 Marx
 just
 got
 paid.


Brookfield
 acquired
 the
 rest
 of
 Oak
 Tree


for
 $3
 billion.
 The
 transaction
 is


expected
 to
 close
 in
 the
 first
 quarter


of
 next
 year.
 Maybe
 there's
 a
 world


where
 Howard
 Marx
 is
 like,
 "Hey,
 markets


are
 great
 because
 I'm
 about
 to
 get
 a


three
 billion
 dollar
 payday."
 And
 uh
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 that
 we're
 bubbly


because
 then
 the
 acquisition
 of
 my


investment
 firm
 would
 potentially
 make


it
 seem
 uh
 you
 know
 unreasonable
 to


spend
 $3
 billion.
 But
 if
 the
 markets
 are


great
 and
 the
 economy
 is
 fine
 and
 the


S&P
 is
 not
 expensive,
 then
 you
 know
 $3


billion
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.


Having
 said
 that,
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


respect
 for
 Howard
 Marks.
 Like
 a
 lot
 of


respect.
 And
 if
 you've
 listened
 to
 his


memos,
 if
 you've
 heard
 his
 interviews,


he
 is
 not
 the
 type
 of
 guy
 to
 [ __ ]


you.
 I
 mean,
 he
 will
 call
 it
 straight
 no


matter
 what
 type
 of
 market
 environment


we
 are
 in.
 So,
 at
 its
 core,
 I
 do
 think


he
 believes
 that
 the
 S&P
 is
 expensive,


but
 the
 quality
 of
 companies
 are
 much


better.
 It's
 just
 if
 you
 listen
 to
 him


on
 Bloomberg
 a
 month
 and
 a
 half
 ago,
 he


didn't
 sound
 as
 optimistic
 as
 he
 sounded


yesterday.
 He
 really
 didn't.
 And
 if
 you


don't
 believe
 me,
 go
 listen
 to
 his


Bloomberg
 interview
 from
 a
 month
 ago.


So,
 yes,
 as
 S
 says
 right
 here,
 sometimes


you
 got
 to
 let
 the
 ink
 dry.


Sometimes
 you
 got
 to
 let
 the
 ink
 dry.


And
 maybe
 maybe
 that
 could
 have
 been
 a


reason.
 Uh,
 Grab
 did
 get
 another
 upgrade


today.
 City
 Bank
 upgraded
 them
 to
 $7.
 So


now
 we
 have
 four
 analysts
 that
 have


upgraded
 grab
 to
 $7.
 City
 analyst
 Alicia


Yap,
 her
 last
 name
 is
 Yap.


Huh?


I
 need
 to
 find
 this
 woman.
 Raised
 her


grab
 price
 to
 $7
 from
 660.
 Maintaining
 a


buy
 rating
 opens
 a
 30-day
 upside


catalyst
 watch.


Dude,
 I
 think
 $7
 is
 on
 the
 table.
 I


really
 do.
 I
 mean,
 I
 could
 be
 wrong,
 but


I
 think
 if
 they
 give
 a
 good
 quarter,
 all


the
 analysts
 are
 kind
 of
 coming
 to
 the


conclusion
 that
 this
 thing
 probably


deserves
 to
 be
 around
 seven
 bucks.
 And


if
 so,
 there's
 some
 upside.
 But
 we're


going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 end
 ends
 up


playing
 out.
 Yeah,
 YAP,
 bro.
 Her
 name
 is


YAP.
 Alicia
 Yap.


I
 need
 to
 I
 just
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 I
 mean


I'm
 a
 yapper.
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 to
 talk


to
 someone
 who
 has
 who
 is
 blessed
 with


the
 last
 name
 of
 Yap.
 Yap.


Oh,
 did
 Bezos
 sell
 some
 Amazon?
 Maybe
 is


the
 Maybe
 this
 is
 why
 Amazon's
 been


getting
 hit.
 Amazon
 Jeff
 Bezos
 reports


updated
 decrease
 ownership
 of
 9%.


How
 much
 did
 he
 own
 before?


Um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 9.5.
 So
 not
 a


crazy
 decrease.
 9%.
 Yeah,
 there
 it
 is.


He
 owned
 900


no
 883
 million
 shares.
 9%.
 There
 you
 go.


Decreased
 ownership
 stake
 of
 9%.


I
 think
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 was
 at
 like


12%
 before
 or
 anything.
 I
 think
 he
 was


around
 like
 9.2
 9.3.
 So
 I
 mean
 we
 and
 we


knew
 that
 he
 was
 selling
 over
 the
 past


couple
 months.
 So
 that's
 not
 that


surprising.


But
 yeah,
 Bezos
 has
 to,
 you
 know,
 pay


for
 his
 weddings.
 So
 uh
 I
 also
 closed


their
 $1
 billion
 convertible
 note


offering
 today.
 So
 that
 is
 something


that
 is
 good
 for
 IM.
 They
 raised
 a


billion
 bucks
 69.49.
 I
 mean
 again
 this


stock
 has
 just
 done
 wonders
 for
 people.


Um,
 year
 to
 date,
 the
 stock
 is
 up
 565%.


I
 mean,
 absolutely
 life-changing
 for
 a


lot
 of
 people.
 And
 look,
 if
 they
 get
 a


deal
 like
 Nebius
 got
 with
 Microsoft,
 who


knows
 where
 the
 stock
 can
 go
 if
 they
 are


going
 to
 continue
 to
 expand.
 And
 I


imagine
 they're
 buying
 all
 these
 GPUs
 to


one
 day
 get
 that
 type
 of
 a
 deal.
 The


question
 is
 just
 when
 you
 think
 that


ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 His
 most
 was
 like


10%.
 Yeah,
 you
 know,
 he
 would
 have


another
 um
 he
 would
 have
 another


I
 think
 he
 would
 have
 another
 Hold
 on,


let's
 do
 the
 exact
 math.


Um,


well,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 literally
 the


exact.
 He
 would
 have
 another
 50
 billion


if
 he
 didn't
 get
 a
 divorce
 because
 he


gave
 4%


uh
 of
 his
 Amazon
 stock
 to
 McKenzie,
 his


wife,
 which
 at
 the
 time
 was
 worth
 about


36
 billion.
 That
 obviously
 increased,


but
 she
 gave
 away
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money.


She
 still
 has
 around
 30
 billion,
 but
 you


know,
 Amazon
 stock
 did
 really
 well
 since


2019.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 he
 would
 have
 another


probably
 40
 50
 billion


if
 he
 didn't
 give
 away
 that
 4%
 stake.
 I


mean
 he
 would
 officially
 be
 the
 rich
 or


very
 close
 to
 the
 richest
 guy
 on
 earth.


I
 mean
 I
 know
 Elon
 has
 dwarfed
 him
 but


still
 that
 4%
 stake
 kind
 of
 kind
 of
 set


him
 back.
 Um


all right
 so
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 in
 the


context
 of
 Mr.
 Basil.
 So
 let's
 see
 what


other
 headlines
 we
 got.
 Again
 Jason
 will


be on
 in
 about
 10
 minutes
 or
 about
 five


minutes
 and
 we'll
 get
 into
 technical


Tuesday.
 Oh
 here's
 a
 big
 update
 today


for
 Bitcoin.
 The
 DOJ
 seized
 15
 billion


in
 Bitcoin
 from
 a
 pig
 butchering
 scam


based
 in
 Cambodia.


So
 you
 got
 the
 DOJ
 getting
 another
 15


billion.
 Add
 that
 to
 the
 United
 States


balance
 sheet
 and


you
 know
 they're
 probably
 not
 going
 to


sell
 it
 given
 how
 bullish
 Trump
 is,
 but


you
 got
 more
 Bitcoin
 that
 has
 been


seized
 by
 the
 United
 States
 and
 likely


they
 are
 going
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 it.
 Uh


Rocket
 Lab
 successful
 deployment
 with


Sinspective.
 So
 this
 was
 great
 for


Rocklab
 today.
 Again,
 that
 stock
 didn't


get
 the
 $70
 close,
 but
 did
 get
 around


6850.
 So,
 not
 too
 bad
 there.


And
 Rock
 Lab
 got


some
 momentum
 today
 as
 well.
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 the
 pig
 butchering


scam
 was
 about.
 I
 didn't
 read
 too
 much


into
 it,
 but
 the
 DOJ
 did
 seize
 15


billion
 of
 it.
 All right,
 last
 headline


for
 today
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into


Technical
 Tuesday.
 This
 thing,
 I
 think,


was
 actually
 really
 bullish
 for
 both


Spotify
 and
 Netflix.
 Um,
 they're
 now


having
 a
 video
 podcast
 deal.
 So
 Netflix


is
 going
 to
 be
 licensing
 Spotify
 video


podcast
 from
 Spotify
 studios
 on
 their


platform
 and
 you
 got
 sort
 of
 the
 most


important
 podcasts
 on
 Spotify.
 Bill


Simmons,
 True
 Crime,
 all
 that
 stuff
 that


is
 going
 to
 be
 available
 on
 Netflix.
 The


funny
 thing
 about
 this
 is
 on
 Google,
 all


of
 these
 podcasts
 are
 available
 for
 free


because
 like
 people
 just
 upload
 them
 to


YouTube.
 So
 Google
 really
 doesn't
 have


to
 pay
 for
 these
 podcasts.
 on
 Netflix,


they
 have
 to
 pay
 Spotify
 a
 licensing
 fee


just
 to
 get
 the
 content
 onto
 the


platform,
 which
 has
 always
 been
 my
 gripe


with
 Netflix
 as
 a
 company.
 It's
 like


they
 always
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 more
 and


more
 content,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 they


have
 so
 many
 people
 willing
 to
 pay
 them


for
 the
 content
 because
 people
 assume


Netflix
 is
 like
 some
 premium
 brand
 of


content,
 you
 know,
 that's
 why
 they're


able
 to
 afford
 it.
 So,
 Netflix
 right


there
 was
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Then
 the


Trump
 soybean
 news
 came
 out.
 Spotify,


did
 that
 go
 green
 on
 the
 day?
 Spotify,


yeah,
 it
 was
 at
 700.
 It
 fell
 to
 680


right
 when
 the
 soybean
 stuff
 came
 out.


But
 Spotify
 also


was
 green
 as
 well.
 Why
 would
 you
 watch
 a


podcast
 on
 Netflix?
 It's
 a
 fair
 point,


but
 I
 mean
 people
 do
 watch
 podcasts
 on


YouTube,
 so
 you
 know,
 maybe
 people
 just


turn
 on
 the
 same
 thing
 on
 Netflix
 and


that's
 what
 they
 would
 watch
 as
 well.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got,
 folks.


That's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 I


thought
 this
 market
 close
 would
 be
 a


little
 different,
 but
 we
 got
 an
 update


for
 soybeans.
 This
 was
 the
 tweet
 for


those
 that
 didn't
 see
 it.
 Trump
 is


considering
 to
 stop
 buying
 cooking
 oil


from
 China
 because
 they're
 not
 buying


our
 soybeans.
 Obviously,
 it
 is
 a
 further


escalation
 of
 trade
 tensions
 after


Jameson
 Greer
 kind
 of
 deescalated
 this


morning
 and
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see
 how


the
 market
 reacts
 to
 that.
 But


ironically,
 the
 same
 reason
 why
 the


markets
 were
 down
 one
 and a
 half%
 in
 the


morning
 is
 why
 the
 markets
 potentially


could
 be
 down
 tomorrow,
 which
 has
 to
 do


with
 China.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 this
 is


some
 of
 the
 pain
 that
 you're
 seeing
 as


we
 uh
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 market
 close.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Let's
 get
 into


technical
 Tuesday.
 For
 those
 that
 care


about
 technicals,
 we're
 going
 to
 spend


the
 next
 two
 and
 a
 half
 hours
 going


through
 all
 the
 main
 tickers,
 Nvidia,


Hood,
 Palanteer,
 Tesla,
 etc.
 looking
 at


their
 technicals
 with
 the
 person
 that
 I


think
 is
 one
 of the
 best
 TA
 people
 on


the
 planet.
 And
 in
 about
 an
 hour,
 we


will
 start
 taking
 the
 audience
 requests


and
 we'll
 try
 to
 get
 through
 as
 many


tickers
 as
 possible.
 Five
 minutes
 a


ticker.
 We
 got
 the
 shot
 clock
 on
 the


board.
 You
 guys
 like
 the
 flow
 last
 week


when
 we
 implemented
 that.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 keep
 that
 going
 and
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 it
 is


time


for
 technical
 Tuesday.


>> We
 have
 market
 closed,
 dude.


>> I
 know.


I
 saw
 it.
 Soybeans


>> was
 the
 it
 was
 the
 the
 the
 soybeans


trump
 the
 QT
 was
 the
 line.


>> Soybeans
 trump
 the
 QT.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.


>> Well,
 we're
 live.
 How
 are
 you
 doing?


>> I'm
 good.
 I'm
 going
 to
 see
 if
 I
 can


join.
 I
 can't
 always
 see
 the
 comments.


Maybe
 I
 can
 join
 this
 through
 the


Oh,
 there
 you
 go.
 Do
 you
 have
 it
 on
 your


phone?


Yeah,
 I
 actually
 have
 it
 on
 my
 iPad.
 My


iPad.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 haven't
 showed
 you


guys
 this,
 but
 this
 is
 how
 I
 keep
 track


of
 all
 the
 comments.


>> Yeah,
 because
 I
 can't
 look
 like
 multiple


places
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 and
 Streamyard


comments
 don't
 really
 keep
 it
 up
 that


well.


>> And
 this
 is
 my
 background
 of
 my
 iPad
 for


those
 that
 have
 never
 seen
 it.


>> Dude,
 it's
 been
 like
 this
 for
 almost
 two


years.
 I
 just
 haven't
 changed
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 nice


background.
 Why
 not?
 Why
 not?


I'm
 never
 beating
 the
 allegations.
 All


right,
 so
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 I'm
 going
 to


put
 a
 Google
 doc
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.


This
 will
 keep
 track
 of
 all
 the
 tickers.


Couple
 things.
 Please
 do
 not
 spam
 your


ticker.
 I
 promise
 I
 have
 a
 big
 ass
 iPad.


I
 can
 see
 all
 the
 names.
 So
 please
 do


not
 spam
 it.
 If
 you
 spam
 it
 more,
 it's


going
 to
 make
 us
 not
 want
 to
 do
 the


ticker.
 So
 that's
 the
 first
 thing.


Number
 two,
 do
 not
 give
 us
 any
 OTC


stocks
 or
 stocks
 that
 are
 under
 a


billion.
 If
 you
 keep
 asking
 us,
 first
 of


all,
 Jason
 can't
 really
 do
 TT
 on
 those.


it's
 it's
 likely
 not
 even
 that
 legal
 for


us
 to


>> to
 talk
 about
 them
 because
 they're


probably
 of
 low
 floats.
 We
 don't
 want
 to


be
 moving
 those
 stocks.
 And
 number
 two


is
 just
 like
 we
 can't
 do
 those
 names.


Like
 you
 can
 go
 to
 other
 places
 for


those
 names,
 but
 we
 really
 can't
 talk


about
 those
 names.
 And
 then
 number


three,
 again,
 we
 will
 take
 audience


requests
 in
 an
 hour.
 We
 usually
 get
 to


most
 of
 them.
 We're
 going
 to
 miss
 some


of
 them,
 but
 we
 usually
 get
 to
 most.


Just
 got
 to
 be
 a
 little
 patient.
 We
 will


get
 to
 all
 the
 big
 ones
 that
 matter.
 But


uh
 we'll
 be
 here
 for
 the
 next
 two
 and
 a


half
 hours.
 And
 Jason
 is
 very
 grateful


every
 single
 Tuesday
 for
 free
 to
 spend


his
 time
 with
 us.
 So
 I'm
 putting
 his


Twitter
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 that
 you


guys
 can
 follow
 him
 and
 his
 YouTube
 and


we
 will
 get
 to
 as
 many
 tickers
 as


possible.
 And
 again,
 I
 I
 like
 if
 you


spam,
 dude,
 like
 it's
 it's
 really
 hard


for
 a
 chat
 to
 function
 if
 they're
 spam.


So
 if
 you
 spam
 your
 ticker
 three,
 four


times,
 you're
 just
 going
 to
 get
 banned.


>> Is
 this
 what
 we've
 come
 to?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 because
 people
 people
 are
 so,


you
 know,
 they
 love
 their
 tickers
 so


much.


>> I
 get
 it.
 I
 understand.
 like
 we're
 gonna


try
 to
 do
 them,
 but
 if
 you
 spam
 some


random
 ticker
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 you


like
 you're
 just
 not
 gonna
 be
 able
 to


participate
 and
 that
 and
 that
 sucks.
 And


it
 sucks
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 chat.
 So,
 I


don't
 I'm
 not
 even
 the
 one
 that
 wants
 to


ban
 you,
 but
 the
 rest
 of the
 chat
 will


not
 function
 if
 there's
 one
 ticker
 over


and
 over
 and
 over
 again
 coming
 back
 and


forth.
 So,
 please
 don't
 do
 that.
 I
 hate


being
 a
 dictator,
 but
 please
 do
 not
 spam


a
 ticker.


>> All right.


>> Secretly
 secretly
 he
 enjoys
 it,
 though.


>> No,
 I
 I
 do.
 I
 really
 don't
 because
 then


people
 freaking
 email
 me
 like,
 "Oh,
 Mid,


you
 banned
 me.
 What's
 going
 on?"
 and


they
 have
 to
 go
 to
 YouTube
 and
 go
 in
 my


settings
 and
 unban
 them.
 And
 it's


annoying
 for
 me.
 I'd
 rather
 not
 have
 to


ban
 it.
 But
 it
 really
 disrupts
 the
 flow


of
 the
 chat
 if
 there's
 some
 person


spamming
 Kraken
 every
 five
 minutes.
 And


like
 Kraken
 is
 an
 OTC
 stock.
 We
 can't


look
 at
 Kraken.
 Tell
 Kraken
 to
 go
 to
 the


NASDAQ.
 Maybe
 then
 we
 can
 look.
 We
 can't


look
 at
 these
 over
 the
 counter.
 Not
 Wolf


of
 Wall
 Street.
 We
 can't
 look
 at
 these


pink
 sheet
 stocks.
 I'm
 sure
 some
 of
 them


are
 great
 companies,
 but
 we
 just
 can't


do
 TTM.


All
 right.
 Having
 said
 that,
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Um,
 I
 think
 let's
 start
 off


with
 SPY.
 Let's
 go
 with
 spy.
 And
 what


are
 you
 thinking
 is
 going
 on
 with
 the


S&P
 5?


>> All right.
 So,
 let
 me
 go
 ahead
 and
 share


>> and
 yeah,
 we'll
 keep
 the
 five
 minutes.


We'll
 keep
 the
 flow
 good.
 I'm
 pissed


because
 of
 the
 soybeans.


>> Ruined
 his
 They
 ruined
 his
 thumbnail,


guys.
 Like,
 he
 had


>> I
 put
 green
 on
 the
 thumbnail
 green


clothes


>> and
 now
 it
 looks
 stupid
 because
 we're


not
 green.


Like
 I
 put
 JPL
 in
 a
 fresh
 green


thumbnail
 and
 then
 you
 know


>> he's
 like
 that's
 legitimately
 what
 he's


upset
 about
 right
 now.


>> That's
 what
 I'm
 that's
 what
 I'm
 mad


about.


>> All right.
 So
 um
 I
 got
 a
 little
 for
 my


throat.
 These
 uh
 throat
 bombs.
 What
 is


it
 called
 when
 you
 with
 the
 noises


the


when
 you
 know
 you
 hear
 me
 with
 the


Anyways,
 so
 we'll
 work
 through
 it.


>> All right.
 Are
 you
 ready?


>> I'm
 ready.


>> On
 the
 top
 left
 of
 my
 screen,
 there
 is
 a


ticker


here.


>> Oh,
 that's
 good.
 That's
 even
 better,


bro.
 Keeping
 it.
 Yeah,
 that's
 better.


>> Oh,
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 it
 this
 big?


>> A
 little
 bit
 smaller.
 Yeah,
 that's


perfect.
 That's
 perfect.
 There
 you
 go.


>> All right.


>> There
 you
 go.
 All right.
 S&P.
 Let's
 get


into


>> So,
 this
 is
 the
 countdown.
 So,
 if
 you're


wondering
 why,
 this
 is
 the
 countdown
 to


kind
 of
 keep
 us
 on
 track.
 The
 attempt.


Ready,
 set,
 S&P.
 All right.
 So,
 so
 spy,


I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 start
 on
 the
 weekly.


Last
 week,
 we
 had
 um


really
 just
 like
 the
 Trump
 the
 Trump


shenanigans,
 if
 you
 will.
 And
 um
 you


know,
 I'll
 just
 take
 this
 off
 for
 a


moment.
 A
 couple
 of
 my
 other
 lines.
 I


wasn't
 able
 to
 prep
 fully,
 but
 from
 a


weekly
 perspective,
 not
 last
 week,
 but


the
 week
 before
 last,
 that's
 672
 to
 661.


Hopefully
 you
 guys
 can
 see
 all
 the


numbers.
 Looks
 like
 you
 can
 see
 all
 the


numbers


on
 my
 screen.
 Um,
 so
 at
 66161,


that's
 where
 we're
 actually
 going
 to
 be


above
 not
 last
 week,
 but
 the
 week
 before


is
 closed.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 an


important
 level
 when
 you
 see
 a
 candle


like
 this,
 like
 this
 big
 giant,
 what
 we


call
 this
 a
 kill
 candle
 because
 it
 kills


the
 momentum.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 usually
 just


it's
 a
 sentiment
 thing.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 sentiment
 is
 important.
 What
 I
 just


did
 was
 I
 threw
 a
 fib
 on
 just
 this
 this


past
 week's
 candle
 and
 that
 50%
 range
 is


66340


right
 here.
 This
 is
 what
 we're
 going
 to


call
 a
 bearish
 retracement.
 So
 in
 this


box,
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 it's
 a
 bearish


retracement.
 And
 that's
 actually
 exactly


what
 we
 hit
 today
 right
 here.
 And
 so


that's
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 top
 of
 a
 bearish


retracement.


In
 order
 for
 this
 to
 actually
 follow


through,
 what
 what
 needs
 to
 happen
 is
 we


actually
 need
 to
 expand
 above
 666
 and
 a


half.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 your
 key


point.
 It's
 also
 going
 to
 line
 up
 with


about
 a
 20-day
 simple
 moving
 average.
 So


put
 that
 it's
 a
 20-day
 simple
 moving


average.
 I
 have
 mine
 locked
 on
 the
 daily


even
 though
 this
 is
 a
 weekly
 chart,
 but


the
 20-day
 simple,
 that's
 going
 to
 more


or
 less
 be
 your
 your
 major
 trend
 break


for
 now.
 If
 we're
 below
 661,
 then
 the


way
 this
 works
 is
 really
 you're
 just


going
 to
 go
 candle
 to
 candle,
 possibly


the
 bottom
 of
 last
 week,
 which
 is
 more


or
 less
 where
 we've
 stopped.
 If
 we
 do


lose
 this,
 the
 next
 rung
 down
 here,
 next


candle
 low
 is
 down
 to
 647.


And
 that's
 really
 um
 that's
 actually


where
 we
 would
 probably
 end
 up
 stopping


anyways


on
 the
 next
 next
 kind
 of
 retest
 of


support.
 So
 for
 now,


>> did
 you
 did
 you
 think
 the
 665
 uh
 level


we
 hit
 today
 was
 bullish
 before
 the


soybeans
 thing?
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 was
 a


good
 reversal
 that
 we
 had
 throughout
 the


day?


>> It
 was
 a
 good
 it
 was
 a
 good
 intraday


reversal.


>> It
 actually
 go
 to
 go
 up
 to
 do
 that
 1.5%


sort
 of
 Vshape.


Yeah,
 it
 really
 was.
 But
 then
 when
 you


look
 at
 when
 you
 and
 now
 I've
 zoomed


into
 a
 30-inut
 chart
 in
 our
 in
 our


private
 group,
 my
 note
 was
 look,
 we're


running
 into
 on
 both
 the
 Q's
 and
 spy.


And
 I've
 just
 kind
 of
 traced
 this.
 The


white
 line
 is
 that
 20-day
 simple
 moving


average.
 For
 whatever
 reason,
 technicals


and
 these
 random
 news
 flow
 events
 always


line
 up.
 And
 so
 to
 see
 this
 rejection


literally
 at
 the
 20-day
 simple
 moving


average
 wasn't
 surprising
 to
 me.
 My
 note


to
 our
 group
 was
 it's
 not
 a
 good
 spot


riskreward-wise
 for
 net
 new
 money
 longs.


I
 could
 easily
 see
 this
 coming
 back
 and


actually
 kind
 of
 like
 chopping
 around


and
 putting
 a
 couple
 days
 of
 sideways


action
 into
 the
 market
 to
 really
 just


digest
 what
 just
 happened.
 And
 usually


that's
 what
 happens
 when
 we
 see
 a
 big


what
 we
 call
 kill
 candle
 like
 this.
 It's


not
 really
 a
 short
 until
 you're
 breaking


these
 lows
 in
 between
 this.
 What
 we
 call


this?
 We
 call
 this
 an
 inside
 day.


Meaning
 that
 t
 like
 these
 days,
 these


last
 two
 days
 were
 inside
 the
 prior
 like


large
 candle.
 And
 so
 until
 this
 area


breaks,
 it's
 really
 we
 just
 we
 really


just
 haven't
 gone
 anywhere.
 So
 the
 way


you
 view
 this
 is
 it's
 digestion.
 Um,
 and


my
 note
 to
 put
 these
 things
 out,
 these


little
 lines,
 this
 this
 fib


retracements,
 um,
 is
 just
 just
 in


essence
 to
 say,
 hey,
 look,
 we
 have
 a


small
 tradable,
 this
 is
 trading,
 right?


A
 tradeable
 range
 from
 here
 to
 here
 and


then
 not
 but
 not
 until
 we're
 actually


over
 672
 are
 we
 really
 fully
 in
 the


clear
 because
 you
 still
 need
 to
 be


cautious
 here
 of
 some
 kind
 of
 a


pullback.
 But
 you
 don't
 really
 want
 to


see
 this
 here.
 Now,
 tomorrow
 if
 we
 do


bounce,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 running
 out
 of
 time


here.
 This
 would
 be
 worst
 case
 scenario


like
 that.
 That
 would
 be
 tomorrow
 to


have
 a
 green
 open
 tomorrow.
 Having
 a


green
 open
 and
 a
 red
 close
 would
 would


probably
 be
 worst
 case
 scenario


intraday,
 very
 short
 term
 um
 for
 active


traders.
 But
 even
 in
 that
 case,
 you're


still
 gonna
 maybe
 retest
 these
 lows,


which
 again,
 if
 this
 locks
 in
 a
 higher


low,
 higher
 than
 this
 aftermarket
 low,


that's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 a
 viable


possibly
 going
 to
 be
 a
 viable
 dip.


Anyways,
 that
 lines
 up
 somewhere
 around


this
 prior
 retest
 here,
 but
 that's
 spy


for
 now.


>> Okay.
 Uh,
 hoodie,
 what
 are
 we
 thinking


about
 that?


>> Hoodie.


So
 hoodie's
 in
 uh
 a
 very
 similar


position
 where
 like
 this
 is
 from
 that


last
 breakout
 of
 123.


This
 is
 where
 everybody
 really
 started


fumbling
 over
 themselves
 on
 where
 do


where
 do
 we
 reprice
 Robin
 Hood
 after


these
 uh
 event
 contracts
 measuring
 from


this
 breakout
 point
 to
 the
 actual
 tops


here.
 This
 this
 area
 is
 that
 kind
 of


like
 right
 in
 between
 we
 call
 this
 a


golden
 retracement.
 Um
 the
 very
 bottom


of
 that
 is
 about
 132.


You
 you
 generally
 want
 it
 to
 hold
 132.


If
 for
 whatever
 reason
 it
 doesn't,
 then


122s
 would
 be
 that
 full-blown
 retest
 of


this
 kind
 of
 block
 right
 here.
 And
 at


the
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time,
 maybe
 the


50-day
 um
 is
 is
 sitting
 around
 that
 same


general
 area.
 Robin
 Hood
 can
 get
 a


little
 whipsy
 from
 time
 to
 time,
 but


from
 a
 textbook
 perspective,
 assuming
 no


news
 flow,
 actually
 right
 here
 is
 um
 is


a
 pickup
 spot,
 assuming
 that
 the
 trend


is
 intact
 and
 it
 doesn't
 really
 lose
 the


20-day
 simple
 moving
 average.
 So,
 here


now,
 uh
 technically,
 this
 this
 general


area
 is
 a
 is
 a
 pretty
 decent
 riskreward.


I
 can
 pull
 this
 back.


for
 a
 for
 a
 short
 term.
 I
 mean
 short


term.
 So
 when
 I
 talk
 about
 trading,
 side


note,
 um
 time
 horizon,


which
 means
 how
 long
 you
 intend
 to
 hold


things
 is
 paramount.
 So
 when
 I'm


prefacing
 these
 things,
 I'm
 I'm
 mostly


thinking
 week
 to
 week
 because
 I'll
 see


you
 guys
 most
 likely
 in
 about
 a
 week


depending
 on
 how
 many
 earnings
 are


coming
 up.
 Um,
 but
 usually
 you're


looking
 for
 a
 general
 bounce
 like
 this


back
 up
 into
 this
 range,
 which
 would


really
 put
 you
 back
 into
 this
 150
 area.


>> If
 someone
 wanted
 a
 dip
 by
 135,
 do
 you


think
 it's
 not
 crazy
 to
 take
 a
 shot
 at


it
 at
 that
 level?


>> It's
 not
 It's
 not
 crazy
 to
 take
 a
 shot


at
 it.


>> Why
 did
 you
 buy
 it?


>> No,
 I'm
 just
 asking
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 have
 been
 asking,
 you


know,
 when
 do
 I
 get
 when
 do
 I
 get
 in?


It's
 not


>> technically.


>> Yeah,
 technically
 from
 this
 like
 this


most
 recent
 kind
 of
 trajectory,
 this
 is


this
 is
 a
 spot.
 Is
 it
 the
 spot?
 It's
 not


like
 the
 spot.


Um
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 okay
 discount.
 It's


like
 Tesla
 at
 415
 that
 we've
 been
 kind


of
 highlighting
 from


April.
 This
 is
 like
 $40.
 This
 is
 your


broader
 channel.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 kind
 of


like
 that
 center
 line.
 And
 I'll
 just
 uh


since
 I
 got
 a
 couple
 minutes


right
 here,
 this
 is
 the
 entire
 channel.


So
 we've
 just
 really
 kind
 of
 lost
 that


center
 line
 of
 the
 channel.
 The
 low
 end,


so
 deep
 discounts
 would
 be
 in
 that
 120


kind
 of
 area,
 which
 which
 is
 a


full-blown
 retest
 of
 really
 the
 50-day


and
 that
 initial
 breakout
 area
 right


over
 here.
 So
 that's
 your
 deeper


discount
 in
 the
 120s
 right
 here
 is
 a
 is


an
 okay
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 discount


discount
 as
 in
 it's
 not
 you're
 not


buying
 it
 at
 the
 very
 top
 of
 the


channel.
 So
 trade
 location
 matters.
 This


is
 about
 50%
 of
 the
 range.
 This
 is
 your


steepest
 discount
 with
 it
 as
 long
 as
 it


it
 stays
 within
 this
 channel.
 If
 it


doesn't
 stay
 within
 that
 channel
 from
 a


technical
 perspective,
 well
 then
 it


doesn't
 stay
 within
 the
 channel
 and
 then


it
 needs
 to
 change
 it
 needs
 to
 change


the
 trajectory.
 But
 with
 everything


else,
 assuming
 that
 everything
 else


stays
 the
 same,
 this
 is
 the
 trajectory


as
 it
 is
 and
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 broken.


It's
 still
 in
 a
 it's
 still
 in
 a
 solid


uptrend.
 The
 only
 difference
 is
 that


it's
 it's
 moving
 towards
 the
 bottom
 of


the
 channel
 versus
 staying
 in
 the
 top
 of


the
 channel.


>> Okay.
 Amazon.
 What
 are
 you
 thinking?


>> I
 bought
 that
 today.


>> Okay.
 Both.


>> Oh,
 did
 you?
 But
 I
 didn't
 know
 that


Bezos


sold


anything.
 He
 said,


>> well,
 I
 mean,
 he
 had
 like
 nine
 point.
 He


didn't
 sell
 anything
 today,
 but
 I
 guess


he
 just
 reported
 how
 much
 he
 totally
 he


overall
 has.


So,
 my
 thing
 was
 like
 when
 we
 talked


last
 Tuesday,


I
 was
 talking
 about
 the
 bears
 kind
 of


being
 pretty
 weak
 here
 at
 this
 215.
 And


in
 my
 mind,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 this
 and
 I'm


like,
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 wait
 for
 this


chart
 to
 tell
 me
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 get


to
 at
 least
 225.
 And
 assuming
 that
 we


get
 to
 225,
 we
 hold.
 We
 did
 get
 to
 225


pretty
 much
 straight
 away,
 but
 it
 did


not
 hold.
 And
 this
 whole
 time
 my
 other


deeper
 discount
 area
 was
 chat
 probably


knows
 or
 remembers
 210.
 And
 so
 this
 this


morning
 at
 211
 to
 me
 good
 enough
 for


government
 work.
 Uh
 I
 actually
 bought


straight
 up
 equity
 which
 is
 a
 rarity.
 Um


and
 I
 also
 have
 a
 smaller
 hish.


Anyways
 I
 I
 bought
 the
 stock
 um


>> what
 215
 you
 bought
 it
 213.


>> 213.


Yeah,
 it
 it
 was
 like
 a
 a
 morning
 pickup


um
 just
 under
 this
 200
 this
 200
 day


simple.
 So,
 one
 little
 trick
 since
 I
 got


a
 little
 bit
 it
 doesn't
 I
 don't
 know


that
 the
 200
 day
 simple
 moving
 average


which
 is
 this
 red
 line
 here
 actually


saves
 it.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 what
 you're


looking
 for
 is
 a


it's
 possible
 that
 it
 loses
 the
 200
 day


simple
 moving
 average,
 which
 is
 why
 I


actually
 went
 with
 equity
 here
 cuz
 at


this
 level,
 I
 don't
 mind
 actually


starting
 a
 net
 new
 equity
 position
 as
 a


position
 trader.
 That's
 just
 me.
 But


when
 a
 stock
 loses
 the
 200
 day,
 simple,


it
 can
 get
 a
 little
 funky.
 And
 usually


what
 you're
 looking
 for
 is
 a
 situation


like
 this
 or
 a
 situation
 like
 this
 or


something
 hereabouts,
 right?
 And
 so
 one


easy
 way
 to
 do
 this
 is
 to
 go
 on
 a
 daily


chart.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 one-day
 chart.
 And


what
 you're
 looking
 for
 is
 um
 you're


looking
 for
 a
 higher
 daily
 low.
 So
 this


is
 one
 kind
 of
 wick
 which
 lined
 up
 to
 my


my
 general
 loading
 zone
 right
 here.


Longer
 term,
 this
 is
 actually
 not
 a
 bad


retest


right
 over
 here.
 I'm
 okay
 with
 this.


Having
 tested
 this
 area,
 I
 think
 this
 is


more
 of
 what
 we
 ran
 into.
 So,
 testing


this
 whole
 breakout
 over
 here,
 I'm
 okay


with
 this.
 Is
 it
 possible
 that
 news
 flow


happens
 and
 this
 loses
 this
 area?
 It
 it


is.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 jump
 in
 front
 of


this,
 but
 what
 I
 will
 be
 doing
 is
 I'll


be
 watching
 for
 uh
 basically
 a
 a
 a
 daily


higher
 low.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 looking


for
 some
 kind
 of
 structure
 like
 this


where
 I
 have
 a
 it's
 coming
 down.
 I
 have


a
 candle
 like
 this
 and
 um
 and
 then
 I


break
 a
 high
 and
 then
 I
 will
 pick
 up
 on


the
 higher
 low.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 low
 and


then
 we'll
 have
 a
 higher
 low.


A
 higher
 low
 like
 this.


>> The
 the
 equity
 you
 picked
 up,
 would
 you


be
 willing
 to
 hold
 that
 equity
 for
 like


five
 years
 or
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 of


the
 equity
 that
 you
 bought?


>> Usually,
 uh
 if
 I'm
 buying
 equity,
 I


don't
 want
 to
 have
 short-term
 gains.
 So,


more
 than
 12
 months.


>> Okay.


>> Um


>> makes
 sense.
 is
 is
 if
 I'm
 buying
 equity,


I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 usually
 looking
 for
 um


short-term
 cap
 gains,


which
 means
 that
 and
 and
 I
 don't
 do
 it


all
 at
 once.
 So
 if
 I
 do
 do
 it,
 okay,


here's
 my
 here's
 a
 spot
 there's
 pos
 like


it
 would
 be,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 wherever
 it
 lands.
 If
 it
 loses
 the


200
 day,
 it
 could
 just
 become
 all
 right,


well
 now
 I'm
 sitting
 in
 a
 falling
 knife


and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 just
 average
 down


because
 I'm
 red.
 Like
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do


that.
 I
 got
 to
 wait
 till
 it
 actually


fills
 or
 like
 till
 it
 stops
 and
 starts


to
 go
 sideways.
 But
 the
 best
 way
 to
 do


that
 is
 to
 either
 look
 for
 something


like
 this,
 but
 use
 that
 little
 trick.
 If


you
 have
 a
 low,
 then
 even
 a
 higher
 low,


daily
 higher
 low,
 something
 like
 that


that
 is
 below
 the
 200
 day
 simple,


usually
 your
 a
 second
 like
 daily
 higher


low
 when
 the
 stock
 is
 actually
 below
 the


200
 day
 simple
 moving
 average
 ends
 up


being
 a
 pretty
 good
 buy.
 Nine
 out
 of
 10


times.
 Don't
 quote
 me
 on
 that
 stat,
 but


a
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 just
 waiting
 for
 a


small
 structural
 break
 or
 reversal
 when


the
 stock
 is
 actually
 below
 the
 200
 day.


Most
 people
 say,
 "Oh,
 get
 out
 because


it's
 under
 the
 200
 day."
 I
 actually
 like


to
 buy
 be
 below
 the
 200
 day.
 That's
 just


me.


So,
 um,
 as
 close
 to
 maybe
 even
 below,


I'll
 be
 happy
 with
 it.


>> BMNR.


>> BMR.
 We
 talked
 about
 this
 a
 little
 bit


last
 night,
 but
 53
 as
 close
 to
 50
 as
 you


could


was
 going
 to
 be
 to
 me
 kind
 of
 where
 we


are.
 This
 was
 that
 prevailing
 uptrend,


but
 net
 net
 very
 much
 in
 consolidation


here.
 So,
 still
 in
 consolidation,
 still


holding
 this
 general
 area.


We're
 right
 on
 the
 cusp.
 Oops,
 did
 I


just
 I
 didn't
 mean
 to
 move
 that.
 But


we're
 right
 on
 the
 cusp.
 Um,
 man,
 yeah,


you're
 right.
 This
 is
 47.


47
 was
 a
 good
 pickup
 after
 hours.
 If


anybody
 caught
 that,
 that
 was
 a
 good
 I


feel
 like
 that
 was
 a
 good
 deal.


>> That
 was
 uh
 that
 was
 3,400
 ETH
 at
 47.


>> I
 mean,


we
 could
 talk
 about
 ETH,
 but
 if
 anybody


had
 those
 resting
 orders,
 I


unfortunately
 did
 not
 have
 my
 resting


orders
 out
 there,
 but
 on
 the
 last


technical
 Tuesday,
 we
 talked
 about


needing
 to
 have
 orders
 sitting
 out
 there


because
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 so
 fast.
 This


is
 welcome
 to
 crypto.


But
 that
 that's
 how
 it
 works.
 But
 that


that
 ends
 up
 being
 like
 a
 a
 really
 good


liquidity
 grab
 to
 me.
 53
 generally


speaking
 was
 what
 I
 was
 looking
 for.
 We


are
 here.


Um
 I
 like
 it.
 What
 I
 want
 to
 do
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 one
 more
 thing
 and
 just
 add


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 parallel


channel.
 So,
 we're
 just
 barely


at
 the
 bottom
 of
 this.
 So,
 I
 don't


really
 want
 to
 see
 this
 get
 lost.
 Like,


I
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 this
 go
 much
 lower.


So,
 holding
 this
 is
 constructive.
 This
 a


bullish
 hold.


When
 you
 look
 at
 Ethereum
 compared
 to


Bitcoin
 right
 here,
 right
 now,
 last


week,
 I
 also
 said
 I
 think
 that
 Ethereum


will
 start
 to
 outperform
 Bitcoin.
 I


believe
 in
 fact
 that
 it
 has
 begun
 to


outperform
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 that
 would
 be


bullish
 as
 well.
 um
 basing
 and
 then
 I


mean
 this
 is
 this
 should
 be
 it.
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 say
 this
 should
 be
 where
 we


actually
 start
 to
 go.
 We
 could
 have
 some


more
 chop,
 but
 as
 see
 how
 you
 get
 really


close
 to
 this
 the
 peak
 of
 this


consolidation,
 that's
 when
 you
 get
 ready


to
 go.
 Um


and
 then
 just
 as
 an
 aside,


it's
 even
 even
 at
 the
 very
 peak
 of
 this


consolidation,
 it
 can
 still
 look
 really


bullish.
 It's
 still
 going
 to
 be
 65.
 So,


it's
 still
 got
 to
 break
 through
 65


before
 this
 is
 really
 ready
 to
 rock
 and


roll.


It's
 It's
 always
 possible
 when
 you're
 in


these
 kind
 of
 areas
 that
 stocks
 just
 go


sideways
 and
 and
 nowhere.


>> Someone
 says,
 "Did
 BMR
 break
 the
 wedge


support?"


>> It's
 sitting
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 it.


>> Okay.


>> It's
 sitting
 at
 the
 very
 bottom
 of
 it.


the
 wick
 down
 technically
 broke
 it
 but


quickly
 right
 back
 up.
 So
 again,
 support


resistance.
 It's
 not
 hard
 lines
 in
 the


sand.
 They're
 kind
 of
 like
 those
 those


trampoline
 levels.


This
 is
 uh
 quickly
 like
 the
 canvas
 on


the
 trampoline
 kind
 of
 broke.
 Uh
 looks


like
 there
 was
 a
 quick
 repair
 overnight.


So
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 how
 how
 strong
 the


repair
 job
 was
 cuz
 it's
 still
 holding


here.


And
 then
 you
 would
 you
 would
 really
 just


kind
 of
 want
 to
 see
 that
 beach
 ball


bounce,
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 going
 to


be
 that
 big
 of
 a
 bounce
 because
 we're


still
 in
 that
 consolidation.
 And
 again,


remember,
 we
 have
 that
 59


um
 pivot
 above
 us
 that
 we
 still
 have
 to


deal
 with.
 So,
 I
 would
 expect
 that
 to


get
 tested
 again
 and
 then
 continue
 on


with
 in
 this
 trajectory.
 And
 it
 could


just
 it
 could
 just
 hold
 this


and
 then
 eventually
 again
 not
 till
 it's


over
 65


really
 start
 to


get
 some
 legs
 over
 it.
 What
 we
 don't


what
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 is
 you
 don't


want
 to
 see
 this
 and
 then
 this
 kind
 of


trajectory
 start
 to
 happen.


That's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 fun.
 Um
 that


would
 be
 a
 broken
 chart
 in
 this


instance.
 Not
 a
 broken
 chart,
 but
 that


would
 be
 a
 short
 signal.
 Uh,
 and
 again,


just
 to
 be
 fair,
 you
 know,
 I
 want
 to
 be


bullish,
 but
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 bullish,


I
 need
 to
 know
 what
 a
 bearish
 setup


looks
 like
 just
 in
 case.
 But
 that's


that's
 what
 it
 would
 look
 like.
 And


that's
 going
 to
 be
 below
 below
 that
 48


right
 here.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 no
 fun.


Sofi


>> Sophie


um
 held
 but
 not
 extending.
 So
 of
 this


pullback,
 this
 is
 our
 chart
 from
 the


last
 couple
 weeks
 that
 we've
 been
 kind


of
 monitoring
 from
 here.
 this
 308189


to
 that
 recent
 low
 of
 24
 and
 a2
 2480


where
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 fundamental


pivot
 happens


that
 bearish
 retracement


is
 here


but
 this
 still
 looks
 stuck.
 Did
 you
 buy


back
 your
 short
 puts?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 they
 expired
 worthless
 on


Friday.


>> Okay.
 Do
 you
 do
 do
 you
 think
 buyers
 keep


showing
 up
 at
 26
 in
 a
 way
 that
 makes
 it


feel
 like
 that's
 becoming
 a
 real


strength
 of
 support?


>> No,
 it's
 not
 real.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not


massive.
 It's
 just
 the
 bottom
 end
 of
 the


same
 channel.
 This
 is
 like
 where
 Hood


is.
 So
 like
 Hood
 can
 get
 this
 kind
 of


situation
 right
 now.
 Very
 similar.


That's
 And
 so
 this
 blue
 line,
 that's
 the


50-day
 simple.


So
 again,
 kind
 of
 like
 I'll
 make
 that


like
 a
 I
 don't
 know,
 brighter
 blue.


>> I
 feel
 like
 2550
 is
 when
 it
 it
 bounces


usually
 when
 it
 hits
 that
 level.


>> Well,
 if
 you
 below
 25
 for
 the
 past
 like


month.


>> Yeah.
 So
 like
 if
 you
 zoom
 it
 across,


it's
 right
 here.
 So
 this
 is
 to
 your


point.
 So
 you're
 you're
 mentally


remembering
 the
 prior
 resistance,


resistance
 and
 support
 level
 and
 that's


now
 becoming


support
 again,


>> right?


>> Which
 was
 which
 is
 essentially
 a
 retest.


So
 this
 is
 all
 good,
 all
 well
 and
 good


here.
 It's
 also
 retesting
 kind
 of
 like


the
 bottom
 of
 this
 channel
 and
 you
 have


more
 confluence
 off
 the
 50-day
 simple


moving
 average.
 The
 only
 thing
 that's


holding
 it
 back
 is
 the
 the
 center
 line


of
 this
 existing
 channel,
 if
 you
 will,


and
 and
 that's
 sitting
 currently
 around


29
 and
 a
 half.
 As
 this
 continues,
 that


center
 line
 can
 also


like
 grind
 higher.
 Um,
 but
 this
 is
 that


this
 is
 that
 same
 kind
 of
 setup
 that


we've
 seen.
 I
 you
 put
 these
 bear
 zones


in
 because
 we
 want
 to
 know
 where
 the


overhead
 resistance
 is.
 So
 if
 you
 get
 up


and
 over
 2875,


all
 right,
 well
 then
 you're
 going
 to


make
 a
 shot
 into
 the
 30
 into
 that
 30


level.
 And
 if
 it
 can
 continue
 through


30,
 well
 then
 the
 top
 of
 the
 channel
 is


still
 3450.
 So
 this
 area
 here


2875


is
 is
 your
 is
 your
 new
 pivot.
 And
 if


you're
 a
 trader,


again,
 thinking
 like
 month
 to
 month,


week
 to
 week,
 that
 kind
 of
 trade
 looks


like
 this,
 that's
 a
 trade
 box.
 Your
 stop


would
 be
 27.85
 going
 long
 here
 with
 a


target
 at
 34.85
 with
 uh
 it's
 a
 risking


one
 to
 make
 six
 kind
 of
 trade.
 But
 your


profit
 taking
 needs
 to
 happen
 is
 that


that's
 where
 that
 would
 then


>> from
 a
 from
 a
 fundamental
 from
 a
 fun


fundamental
 perspective
 the
 banks


crushed
 today.
 So
 if
 SoFi
 gives
 us
 a


really
 good
 quarter
 uh
 as
 a
 growth


company
 in
 the
 banking
 space
 maybe
 that


also
 push
 it
 back
 above
 30.


>> Yeah.
 It
 would
 just
 basically
 look
 like


this
 from
 and
 that
 that
 would
 still
 be


that
 same
 same
 kind
 of
 channel
 and
 then


you
 could
 go
 sideways
 do
 it
 again
 kind


of
 thing.


Yeah.


Um,
 Tessy,
 what
 do
 we
 got
 going
 on?


>> Tessy's
 struggle
 bus
 right
 now.
 Um,
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 Tesla
 likes
 to
 uh
 Tesla


likes
 to
 be
 the
 center
 of
 attention.
 So,


I
 wasn't
 expecting
 much
 out
 of
 Tesla


today.
 Uh,
 she's
 like
 got
 one
 of
 those


personalities
 where
 like
 if
 she's
 going


to
 go,
 then
 she
 doesn't
 like
 it
 when


anybody
 else
 goes.
 So
 she
 wants
 to
 be


like
 just
 everybody
 look
 at
 me
 and


everything
 else
 can
 go
 down
 and
 Tesla's


going
 to
 go
 up.
 So
 on
 a
 day
 like
 that,


that's
 when
 Tesla's
 rip
 like
 next
 move


is
 really
 going
 to
 start.
 We
 did
 talk


about
 this
 415
 level
 and
 I
 think
 that


was
 absolutely
 critical.
 We
 got
 that


flush
 on
 Friday,
 freaky
 Friday.


This
 this
 stays
 um
 it's
 still
 absolutely


crucial.
 I


was
 so
 close
 to
 taking
 this
 net
 new
 long


on
 Friday's
 close,
 but
 I
 was
 waiting


for
 any
 signs
 of
 life,
 and
 I
 mean
 any


signs
 of
 life
 into
 this
 close,
 and


they're
 just
 like
 I'm
 like,
 "Where
 where


are
 the
 buyers?
 Where
 are
 the
 buyers?"


And
 they
 didn't
 show
 up
 all
 the
 way
 down


to
 the
 close.
 I'm
 like, "What
 what's


going
 on?"
 Um,
 but
 eventually,


I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 I
 should
 have
 just
 I


should
 have
 just
 gone
 with
 my
 gut


because
 it
 closed
 right
 there
 and
 I'm


like,
 it's
 too
 close
 to
 call.
 And
 I
 was


I
 felt
 good
 after
 after
 hours
 cuz
 I'm,


you
 know,
 I'm
 watching
 it
 cuz
 I'm
 like,


I
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 I
 don't
 want
 to


go
 along
 here
 because
 if
 it
 it's
 such
 a


critical
 spot.
 If
 it
 if
 it
 dumps,
 then


it's
 gonna
 be
 it's
 gonna
 be
 ugly,
 right?


Um,
 but
 sure
 enough,
 Sunday
 come
 or,
 you


know,
 Sunday
 comes
 around,
 we
 get
 the


tweet
 and
 then
 Monday,
 you
 know,
 right


back
 to
 the
 20-day
 and
 these
 20-day


simple
 moving
 averages,
 these
 were
 the


critical


technical
 pivots
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 large


fund
 managers
 watch.
 So,
 that's
 this


white
 line.
 So,
 whenever
 anything
 is
 is


chopping
 around
 a
 20-day
 simple
 moving


average,
 that's
 the
 primary
 trend
 that
 a


large
 fund
 manager
 is
 going
 to
 be


watching.
 Um
 and
 again
 where
 Tesla,
 SPY,


QQQ,
 all
 the
 above
 kind
 of
 hit
 their


heads
 up
 on
 resistance
 today.


Um
 to
 see
 that
 that
 pullback


which
 also
 happened
 to
 align
 with
 the
 a


tweet
 not
 surprising.


Now,
 what
 I'll
 say
 from
 here
 is
 that


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 a
 higher


low,
 which
 means
 that
 if
 we
 can
 if
 we


can
 get
 a
 higher
 low
 somewhere
 still


along
 that
 415
 area,
 I
 I


think
 I
 just
 got
 to
 go
 for
 it.
 This
 does


not
 look
 super
 bullish.
 Um,
 so
 the
 the


stuff
 that
 I
 had
 before,
 that's
 coming


down
 right
 now
 just
 in
 case.
 Um,
 but
 if


I,
 this
 would
 be
 a
 net
 new
 trigger,


meaning
 a
 net
 new
 trade
 would
 have
 to


come
 would
 be
 able
 to
 come
 online
 if
 I


do
 get
 this
 type
 of


setup.


So,
 a
 brand
 new
 long
 for
 a
 trade
 cuz
 I


think
 not
 I
 think
 because
 mostly
 this


this
 primary
 trade
 has
 more
 or
 less


played
 out
 and
 if
 I
 stay
 too
 long
 and


overstay
 my
 welcome,
 well,
 I
 do
 risk


this.
 So,
 this
 initial
 is
 being
 unwound


as
 we
 speak.


But


I
 can
 put
 this
 right
 back
 on
 if
 I
 get


this
 kind
 of
 this
 kind
 of
 setup.
 So,


that's
 that's
 what
 I'm
 watching
 for


right
 now.
 Um,
 if
 it
 continues
 through,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 that
 435
 pivot
 to
 get
 a


real
 confirmation.


Sorry,
 I'm
 scooting
 around
 between
 uh


charts
 right
 now.
 Also,
 you
 guys,
 just


cuz
 I'm
 moving
 around
 time
 frames
 a
 lot


cuz
 it
 matters.


But
 again,
 if
 we
 lose,


>> I'm
 not
 excited
 about
 Tesla
 right
 here.


>> Well,
 it
 needs
 a
 catalyst.
 And
 I
 think


there
 the
 only
 catalyst
 is
 earnings,


which
 Tesla
 quite
 frankly
 does
 not
 move


a
 lot
 on
 earnings.
 So,
 I'm
 kind
 of


thinking
 that
 it
 might
 be
 after
 earnings


kind
 of
 thing.
 So,
 it
 could
 just
 go


sideways.
 And
 then
 if
 I
 get
 a
 dip
 to
 buy


post
 earnings,
 um,
 you
 know,
 that
 would


be
 possibly
 ideal.


But
 I
 like
 it.
 It
 I
 I
 do
 like
 it.
 It's


just
 not
 the
 same
 discount
 that
 it
 was


before.
 Plus,
 I
 have,
 you
 know,
 other


Pokemon
 cards
 that
 I'm
 more
 interested


in
 at
 the
 moment
 than
 Tesla,


>> Nvidia,


>> Nvidita.


Shoot.


>> It
 It
 lost
 185,
 right?


>> I
 missed
 this.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 We
 just


outlined
 this.
 This
 is
 our
 lines
 from


last
 Tuesday.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 You're
 right.
 Well,
 that's


Friday
 or
 that's
 today.
 No,
 that's


today.


>> That's
 today.
 Did
 anybody
 buy
 this?


This
 is
 like
 today.
 Like
 right
 now
 live.


>> It's
 at
 Is
 it
 180
 after
 hours
 or
 below


that?


>> That
 was
 the
 buy.


Yeah,
 that
 was
 quick.


>> It
 just
 closed
 there.


>> Well,
 it's
 180.


>> It
 closed
 at
 180.3.


>> There's
 a
 couple
 people
 in
 the
 chat


saying
 they
 bought
 it.
 Yeah,


>> I
 know.
 I
 might
 need
 to
 buy
 this
 right


now,
 too.


Um
 I
 mean,
 I
 have
 I'm
 okay.
 I'm
 okay.
 I


I
 actually
 it
 looks
 like
 I
 bought
 it


this
 day.
 I
 bought
 the
 dip
 already.


Okay.
 I'm
 okay.
 I'm
 okay.
 is
 I
 bought
 I


bought
 I
 guess
 I
 bought
 this
 one.
 Um


I
 don't
 need
 to
 buy
 anymore.
 I
 don't


have
 a
 a


which
 is
 that's
 a
 longer
 hold
 for
 me,


but
 um
 it's
 not
 big.
 I
 I
 I
 like
 this.
 So


I
 like
 this
 as
 a
 retest
 of
 this.
 I
 like


this
 as
 a
 pullback
 from
 that
 prior
 um


attempted
 breakout.
 Currently
 it's
 a


look
 above
 and
 fail,
 right?
 Meaning
 like


it
 looked
 above
 that
 breakout.
 Well,


what
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 is
 I
 don't
 want


to
 see
 this
 lose


um
 175.
 So,
 if
 it
 loses
 175,
 okay,
 cool.


That's
 this
 this
 gray
 box
 right
 here.


But
 in
 terms
 of
 riskreward,


that's
 it.


It's
 here
 now.
 Uh
 so,
 TA
 says
 uh
 take


your
 shot.


I
 mean,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 feel
 like


>> I
 feel
 like
 the
 fundamentals
 supported


as
 well.
 There's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 news


since
 Nvidia
 was
 trading
 at
 175
 180.


That's
 why
 it
 got
 to
 195.
 So,
 the
 fact


that
 it's
 retesting
 it
 technically
 and


fundamentally,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.


>> Okay.


>> And
 you
 have
 TSM
 on
 Thursday,
 which


could
 validate


>> as
 so
 ASML
 is
 like
 kind
 of
 like
 this


canary
 in
 the
 coal
 mine
 for
 me,
 which


reports
 tomorrow
 morning,
 and
 they
 they


are
 really
 hot
 right
 now.
 Like
 the
 stock


price
 is
 very
 high.
 um
 concerningly
 high


to
 me.


Uh
 so
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 white
 line.


Uh
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 make
 this
 entry
 is


as
 close
 to
 this
 as
 you
 can.
 That
 is
 um


17829.


So
 it's
 not
 quite
 there,
 but
 that's
 the


level.
 So
 we
 can
 come
 down
 a
 couple
 more


dollars


and
 that's
 retesting
 like
 all
 of
 this


right
 here.


But
 just
 just
 to
 note
 you
 guys
 um
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 this
 sentiment
 is
 uh


meaning
 like
 tweets
 and
 stuff
 like
 that


that's
 as
 important
 as
 fundamentals


which
 both
 sentiment
 and
 fundamentals
 do


trump
 no
 pun
 intended
 technicals.


So
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 a
 sentiment
 change
 we


can
 see
 what
 we
 call
 kill
 candles


sometimes
 that
 that
 just
 like
 blow


through
 support
 or
 blow
 through


resistance.
 Conversely,
 and
 uh
 in
 the


moment,
 those
 those
 moments


the
 TA
 might
 have
 told
 you,
 hey,


something's
 possibly
 happening,
 but
 like


in
 the
 moment,
 anything
 anything
 goes,


right?
 So,
 while
 while
 things
 are


happening,
 just
 know
 it
 can
 continue
 to


keep
 going,
 you
 ideally
 do
 want
 to
 wait


for
 dust
 to
 somewhat
 settle
 because


yeah,
 it
 might
 hit
 this
 178
 level,
 but


it
 could
 blow
 through
 it
 also.
 And
 you


know,
 depending
 on
 whatever
 news
 is


happening,
 it
 could
 it
 could
 go
 all
 the


way
 down
 to
 170
 and
 then
 open
 up
 in
 the


morning
 at
 180.
 And
 and
 in
 even
 in
 that


event,
 sure
 178
 would
 have
 been
 the


level
 to
 get
 to,
 but
 because
 maybe
 some


kind
 of
 sentiment,
 maybe
 some
 kind
 of


fundamental
 catalyst
 happened,
 you
 know,


there
 could
 have
 been
 a
 wick
 that
 that


takes
 you
 down
 like
 that
 in
 the
 moment.


So,
 just
 as
 just
 to
 keep
 that
 in
 mind,


these
 aren't
 like
 as
 close
 to
 or
 below


uh
 as
 close
 to
 high
 170s
 as
 you
 can.


I
 like
 this.
 I'm
 a
 little
 I'm
 I
 I
 think


I
 need
 to
 take
 a
 closer
 look
 at
 this


from
 my
 group.


>> Okay.
 Palanteer,


>> what
 do
 you
 think?
 Uh
 Palunteer,


>> I
 I
 like
 it
 too
 though.
 I
 like
 Nvidia.


Well,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 about
 uh
 AMD


stuff


>> because
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 holding


it
 back
 as
 if
 it's
 like
 a
 zero
 sum
 game


for
 and
 because
 it
 kind
 of
 is,
 but
 like


AMD
 is
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 love
 in
 the
 news


news
 flow
 right
 now.


Um
 so,
 Palunteer,


all
 I
 just
 did
 is
 I
 took
 this
 low
 and


this
 low.
 I
 guess
 I
 should
 probably
 take


these
 two
 lows.
 Yeah.
 So,
 let
 me
 just


make
 this
 a
 straight
 across
 line.
 So


this
 low,
 this
 low


slightly
 breached
 here
 actually
 another


another
 little
 double
 bottom
 off
 the


50-day
 interestingly
 enough.
 Um
 this
 is


the
 box
 and
 uh
 this
 is
 that
 bullish


retracement
 that
 Palanteer
 broke


through.
 So,
 from
 the
 last
 time
 there


was
 a
 live
 trade
 on
 Palunteer
 coming
 up


this
 way
 here,
 making
 it
 right
 into
 this


what
 we
 call
 fair
 value.


Sorry,
 I'm
 using
 a
 mouse.
 Uh
 fair
 value


gap.
 This
 trade
 is
 complete.
 Check
 the


box.
 But
 what's
 bullish
 about
 this
 is


that
 it's
 still
 holding
 that
 major


support
 level.
 So,
 this
 prior
 resistance


is
 now
 acting
 as
 support.
 And
 as
 long
 as


this
 continues
 to
 act
 as
 support
 at
 172


and
 a
 half
 close
 to
 173
 that
 is
 a
 new


cohort
 of
 traders
 or
 investors
 that
 are


accumulating
 here.
 So
 this
 will
 become


this
 is
 becoming
 that
 sport
 and
 it's


actually
 still
 holding
 this
 channel
 this


general
 channel
 right
 now.
 And
 if
 I
 zoom


out


yeah
 I
 had
 a
 feeling
 that
 might
 get
 me


some
 confluence.
 It
 looks
 like
 it.
 Let


me
 see.


It's
 still
 even
 from
 over
 here.


Oh,
 yeah.
 It's
 still
 well
 in
 this
 giant.


Well,
 it
 might.


So,
 I
 have
 two
 15s.


If
 it
 can
 get
 up
 and
 through.


>> They
 got
 upgraded
 to
 200
 today.


>> This
 is
 a
 very
 large
 channel,
 but
 those


center
 lines
 are
 important
 to
 note.
 So,


this
 is
 the
 center
 line
 of
 that
 larger


channel,
 which
 was
 my
 suspicion.


Uh,
 and
 then
 if
 it
 can
 hold
 over
 that


with
 the
 white
 line
 here
 is
 the
 20-day


simple
 moving
 average.
 I'm
 telling
 you


guys,
 these
 are
 going
 to
 be
 pretty


important
 um
 trend
 indicators
 for
 large


funds.
 They're
 going
 to
 price
 chops


around
 those
 quite
 a
 bit.
 Um,
 and
 it's


stuck
 for
 now
 in
 between
 the
 20
 and


50day
 simple
 moving
 average.
 So
 just
 be


cautiously


optimistic
 because
 what
 you
 don't
 want


to
 see
 is
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 see


that.
 That's
 very
 possible


here.
 But
 um


I
 know
 as
 I
 see
 it
 I
 see
 one
 two
 three


and
 this
 would
 be
 four.


If
 this
 is
 the
 fourth
 attempt,


I
 mean
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 one
 of
 my


staples.
 Like
 if
 this
 is
 if
 this
 whole


thing
 is
 part
 of
 the
 fourth
 attempt


to
 break
 through,
 I
 think
 we're
 just
 in


the
 same
 trade


having
 taken
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 breather


here,


which
 takes
 which
 would
 take
 you
 to
 this


still.
 Uh,


let
 me
 just
 let
 me
 just
 get
 a
 little


>> I
 think,
 bro,
 if
 we
 get
 a
 50%
 revenue


quarter,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 going
 to


200,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 getting
 close.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 that's
 not
 for


like
 a
 month.
 So,
 usually
 this
 kind
 of


stuff
 is
 front
 running
 earnings.
 So,
 you


might
 get
 a
 really
 bad
 tech
 you
 might


get
 a
 bad
 technical
 setup
 into
 earnings


if
 if
 the
 market
 front
 runs
 that.
 Yeah.


>> So
 meaning
 like
 if
 you
 get
 that
 move


before
 earnings


like
 that,


you
 might
 there
 you
 might
 be
 there


before
 earnings
 which
 would


kind
 of
 suck


um
 technically


but
 I'm
 seeing
 that
 as
 a
 possibility


cuz
 earnings
 is
 not
 until


well
 I
 guess
 it's
 not
 until
 early


november


>> November
 3rd.
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Um,


let's
 do
 INE.
 What
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 that
 one?
 Had
 a
 monster
 day.


>> Another
 upgrade.
 Um,
 yeah.
 I
 not
 going


to
 lie,
 I
 bought
 the
 stock


>> today


>> for
 a
 trade
 because
 I
 looked
 at
 options


and
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 options
 were


a
 good
 riskreward
 because
 they
 were
 so


juiced.
 But
 from
 a
 technical


perspective,
 we
 had
 actually
 outlined


this
 exact
 this
 is
 last
 week's
 trade.
 We


said
 we
 said
 last
 week
 that
 IRA
 would


come
 back
 to
 50
 as
 a
 basic
 retest.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 can
 see
 that
 little


wick,
 but
 this
 is
 last
 week's
 chart.


There
 it
 is.
 Um
 that
 is
 after
 hours.
 And


then
 today,
 this
 is
 the
 breakout


over
 here
 with
 a
 a
 fundamental
 kind
 of


up
 like
 with
 another
 upgrade
 which
 was


to
 $100,
 but
 $100
 is
 on
 the
 chart
 as


stated.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 still
 in
 the
 same


exact
 trajectory
 that
 we
 outlined
 last


week.
 Nothing
 has
 changed
 on
 this
 chart


from
 last
 week.
 It's
 literally
 doing


exactly
 what
 it's
 been
 doing
 this
 entire


ride.
 So,
 to
 me,
 yeah,
 it's
 scary
 up


here,
 but
 like
 I
 said
 last
 week,
 as
 long


as
 it's
 acting
 right,


um,


then
 it's
 still
 acting
 right.
 And
 for


right
 now,
 it's
 still
 acting
 right.
 And


that
 means
 that
 this
 is
 75
 next.
 Um,
 and


then
 if
 that
 breaks
 through,
 then
 it's


it's
 it's
 into
 the
 '9s
 as
 a
 full


extension,
 which
 kind
 of
 aligns
 with


that
 upgrade.
 Um,
 and
 and
 again,
 you


look
 back
 at
 the
 charts,
 you
 got
 the
 $50


pullback,


the
 in
 all
 its
 glory
 right
 there,
 as
 as


shortlived
 as
 it
 might
 have
 been,


there
 it
 is.
 But
 this
 is
 why
 I
 have
 my


after
 hours
 market
 data
 on
 all
 the
 time


because
 like
 I
 want
 to
 know
 if
 this


trades
 here
 if
 it
 trades
 there
 it
 trades


there
 and
 it
 counts
 and


you
 know


>> what
 is
 your
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 100


like
 what
 are
 you
 looking


>> Yeah
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it
 could
 do


100
 if
 of
 all
 of
 them
 I
 was
 the
 first


one
 to
 make
 the
 shift
 so
 like
 I'm
 not
 so


sure
 I
 really
 I
 think
 we
 talked
 about
 it


last
 night
 I
 I
 think
 that


so
 I
 would
 pause
 this
 and
 we
 would
 time


stamp
 this
 as
 the
 data
 center
 conversion


play
 of
 the
 miners,
 but
 like
 I
 I
 I
 think


the
 data
 center
 conversion
 play
 for
 the


miners
 has
 has
 been
 a
 lifeline
 for
 the


industry
 as
 a
 whole.
 Um
 and
 so
 why
 why


we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 Mara
 whoever


catch
 Clean
 Spark
 catch
 a
 really
 nice


bid
 off
 the
 lows.
 Maybe
 they
 don't
 have


to
 um


uh
 raise
 as
 much
 as
 they
 used
 to
 because


they
 were
 in
 a
 a
 tight
 spot
 and
 maybe


maybe
 some
 shorts
 have
 to
 cover
 and
 you


start
 to
 see
 some
 kind
 of
 short
 squeezes


across
 the
 market.
 But
 Iran,
 I
 think,
 is


the
 is
 is
 primarily
 the
 the
 driver
 here


of
 all
 of
 them.
 Um
 so
 if
 I'm
 going
 to


believe
 one,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 I
 would


default
 to
 believing
 I
 ran
 over
 the
 rest


of
 them
 just
 personally.
 Um,


and
 it's
 got
 the
 most
 Momo
 anyways
 and


it's
 following
 the
 technicals
 like


beautifully.
 So,


>> and
 I
 think
 they
 have
 the
 most
 GPUs
 to


me.


>> That's
 Yeah.
 So,
 the
 other
 ones
 the


other
 ones
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 I
 we
 talked


about
 it
 briefly
 last
 night,
 but
 I
 was


like
 I
 the
 A6
 they'll
 get
 depreciated
 to


me,
 but
 um
 but
 are
 they
 really
 going
 to


go
 out
 and
 buy
 GPUs?
 The
 only
 one
 that
 I


think
 that
 went
 out
 and
 started
 this


whole
 trend
 was
 Iran.
 And
 so
 if
 anybody


was
 going
 to
 do
 that,
 I
 would
 probably


just
 default
 to
 believing
 Iran.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 agree.
 I
 agree.
 Um
 AMD,
 what


are
 we
 thinking
 here
 after
 the
 opening?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 bullish
 hold.


We
 had
 240
 as
 the
 extension
 even
 off


this.


>> Oh,
 we
 got


>> Yeah,
 there
 it
 is.
 That's
 from
 our
 This


is
 last
 week.
 Um,


>> we
 got
 a
 reset
 timer.


>> I
 thought
 you
 wanted
 to
 go
 extra
 on
 AMD.


No.
 Okay.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 still
 holding


210.


Uh,
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a
 situation
 where


like
 you
 do
 want
 it
 to
 continue
 to
 hold,


but
 but
 after
 a
 move
 like
 this,
 I
 think


expecting
 it
 to
 go
 sideways
 is
 perfectly


fine.


uh
 which
 which
 means
 that
 205
 is
 is


really
 like
 where
 you'd
 want
 it
 to
 hold.


If
 it
 loses
 205,
 you
 have
 a
 couple


different
 spots.


One's
 195.
 And
 to
 me,
 the
 big
 the
 big


mac
 daddy
 dip
 would
 be
 in
 that
 185s,
 but


I
 don't
 know
 that
 you're
 necessarily


going
 to
 see
 it.
 Um,


for
 now,


this
 is
 your
 general
 trajectory.
 And
 I


think
 you're
 probably
 going
 to
 start
 to


see
 some
 kind
 of
 consolidation,


which
 looks
 something
 like
 that.
 But,


but
 even
 then,
 just
 know
 when
 when
 AMD


does
 go
 into
 consolidation,
 it
 can
 be


for
 a
 while.
 So,
 it
 might
 go
 into


something
 like
 this.


Um,
 I
 might
 use
 like
 a
 fractal
 or


something.
 Um,


oops.


But
 I
 might
 I
 might
 just
 like
 say
 it


does
 exactly
 this.


And


uh,


dude,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 use
 this
 tool


anymore.
 I
 They
 must
 have
 moved
 their


tools.
 Where
 is
 the
 tool?


We
 did
 BMR
 guys.
 You
 can
 read


>> the
 tool's
 gone
 that
 I
 used
 to
 use


>> the
 185
 level
 they
 were
 talking
 about.
 I


don't
 think
 we
 get
 that
 either.
 I
 mean,


if
 we
 get
 that,
 that's
 giving
 up
 a
 lot


of
 the
 gains
 from
 the
 opening
 ideal.


>> So,
 low
 200s
 is
 the
 dip
 people
 are


looking
 for
 probably
 if
 it
 gets


>> Let
 me
 um


So,
 that's
 what
 this
 is.
 So
 here


195
 to
 188
 that's
 from
 this
 move
 to
 that


top.
 If
 I
 adjust
 this
 to
 the
 full
 240


it's
 still
 203


to
 1901.


203
 to
 191


which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 good
 enough.


Quite
 frankly,
 it's
 kind
 of
 bothering
 me


that
 I
 don't
 have
 that.
 Um,


I
 don't
 know
 where
 they
 move
 that
 tool.


It's
 called
 ghost
 feed.


Oh,
 well,


but
 that
 that
 could
 be
 like
 an
 extended.


It
 would
 basically
 be
 like
 this
 kind
 of


a
 similar
 move
 where
 you
 get
 in
 and
 it


does
 this
 and
 you
 get
 out
 and
 then
 and


then
 it
 goes
 sideways
 for
 a
 while


extended
 while


and
 then
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 chops


around.


>> So
 you
 think
 it's
 it's
 stuck
 within
 200


to
 220
 for
 the
 time
 being?


>> 240


>> 240


>> which
 is
 quite
 frankly
 it's
 a
 really


large
 range.


Yeah,
 it
 is
 a
 very
 large
 range,
 you


know.


Okay,
 cool.
 Um,


let's
 do
 this
 one.
 Let's
 get
 this
 out
 of


the
 way.
 Grabby
 Grab,
 what
 are
 you


thinking
 on
 this
 one?
 Got
 a
 couple


upgrades
 to
 seven
 bucks
 earnings
 in
 a


month.


>> Yeah,
 I
 didn't
 look
 at
 it
 today.


>> Basically
 under
 six
 ever
 since


>> 570.
 Oh,


was
 that
 an
 after
 hours?


>> No,
 I
 got
 there
 today.
 in
 the
 like
 at


9:30,
 9:40.
 I
 think


>> dude,
 all
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 a
 lot
 of
 these


discounts
 were
 after
 hours.


I
 waited
 to
 the
 actual
 bell
 for
 a
 lot
 of


the
 stuff.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 I
 don't


know
 if
 I
 get
 too
 greedy
 waiting
 for


after
 hours.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know.
 How


do
 you
 guys
 pick
 this
 up?
 Are
 you


getting
 this
 after
 hours?


>> 550.


>> That
 was
 on
 Friday.
 Yeah,
 that
 was


Friday.
 But
 570
 was
 this
 morning.
 So,


you
 know,
 it's
 not


>> not
 great.


>> No,
 it
 looks
 good.


That's
 off
 the
 50-day
 right
 here.


That's
 a
 beautiful
 retest.


So,
 I
 mean
 540
 is
 still
 like
 the
 deepest


retest
 that
 it
 could
 do,
 but
 um
 it


didn't
 hold
 the
 623.
 So,
 we
 we
 know
 that


that's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 kind
 of


consolidate
 a
 bit.
 Let's
 do
 this.


Yeah,
 we'll
 we'll
 do
 Bitcoin
 and
 MSTR
 as


well.


We
 did
 BMR
 already.


>> So,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 use
 this.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened
 here,
 but


this
 looks
 like
 it
 was
 just
 out
 of


trend.
 Whatever
 that
 blip
 on
 the
 radar


is
 in
 April


looks
 like
 the
 fake
 out
 liquidity
 grab.


But
 the
 general
 the
 general
 trend
 if
 I


have
 the
 most
 confluence


here
 is
 still
 like
 all
 of
 this


here
 here


push
 through
 here
 push
 through
 here
 all


of
 this


which
 which
 means
 that
 this
 could
 still


be
 some
 serious
 consolidation.


And
 if
 you
 do
 have
 a
 really
 big
 dip,


what
 is
 that?
 Fives.


Sorry,
 dude.


But
 that
 that's
 what
 it
 looks
 like.


>> I
 wouldn't
 mind
 fives.
 I
 mean,
 I
 would


be
 a
 very
 big
 buyer
 if
 we
 got


>> So,
 yeah.
 So,
 it's
 this
 is
 trade


location.
 So,
 what
 I
 just
 did
 was
 I
 took


this
 prevailing
 uptrend
 cuz
 just
 to
 be


crystal
 clear
 here,
 the
 trend
 is
 up.
 The


trend
 is
 up.
 It's
 almost
 like
 a
 Tesla.


So,
 this
 has
 done
 what
 I
 would
 be


concerned
 about
 for
 Tesla.
 It's
 made


such
 a
 big
 giant
 move
 and
 and
 me
 taking


some
 down
 here,
 but
 looking
 for
 possible


like
 retest
 into
 this
 retesting
 this


prevailing
 uptrend
 would
 be
 your


significant


discounts.
 Five
 and
 a
 quarter


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 get
 five
 and
 a


quarter,
 I
 would
 not
 be
 that
 upset.


>> Five
 and
 a
 quarter.


Good
 to
 cancel.
 Extended
 hours.
 Limit


order
 sent


for
 a
 thousand.
 I'll
 be
 in
 with
 you


working.


>> All right.
 If
 it
 gets
 there,
 there
 you


go.


>> Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 that's
 grab.
 Um,


>> that's
 grab.
 If
 it
 otherwise,
 if
 it's


back
 over
 six
 and
 a
 quarter,
 we're
 on
 a


Kraken.


>> Yeah.
 Uh,
 let's
 do
 ETH
 because
 we
 did


BMR,
 so
 we
 might
 as
 well
 do
 ETH.
 But


thoughts
 on
 that
 one.


>> So,
 I'm
 just
 It
 wasn't
 ETH.
 Ethereum
 is


like,
 okay,
 cool.
 That's
 that
 was
 the


that
 was
 my
 first
 level
 that
 I
 thought


we
 could
 get
 to
 here.


>> Honestly,
 the
 the
 best
 the
 best


discounts
 were
 on
 the
 other
 alts.
 I


mean,
 those
 were
 just
 epically


discounted.
 Um,
 the
 reason
 I
 was
 a


little
 concerned
 over
 here,
 and
 I
 don't


even
 know
 if
 I
 said
 it.
 I
 might
 have


said
 something
 last
 week,
 but
 it
 was


that
 we
 need
 to
 crack
 this


area
 here
 or
 we
 are
 kind
 of
 still
 at


risk
 of
 continuing
 on
 that
 Bart
 Simpson


trajectory.


And
 um
 you
 know,
 as
 bullish
 as
 people


can
 be
 on
 Ethereum,
 I'll
 just
 tell
 you


right
 now,
 38


$3,500,


it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 discount
 on
 ETH.


It's
 really
 not.
 Not
 for
 not
 for
 the


it's
 it's
 not
 a
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 discount.


It's
 a
 it's
 like
 a
 pint-siz
 discount.
 If


you
 want
 a
 big
 discount,
 we're
 talking


25
 we're
 talking
 28s
 maybe,
 right?


That's
 your
 discount.
 Um
 and
 so
 oddly


enough,
 this
 is
 Tes
 Teslaesque.
 This
 is


Graesque
 where
 it's
 here.
 These
 are


decent
 discounts,


but
 again,


where
 is
 our
 broader
 trend?
 Our
 broader


trend
 is
 up


for
 sure,
 right?
 But
 we're
 very
 far
 away


from
 the
 prevailing
 uptrend,
 which
 means


that
 if
 we
 do
 if
 we
 do
 fail
 and
 this


Bart
 Simpson
 does


continue
 to
 Iumba,


this
 is
 landing
 me
 right
 now.
 This
 is


landing
 me
 at
 32,


which
 32
 is
 a
 50%
 retracement
 from
 the


alltime,
 not
 the
 alltime,
 from
 the
 most


recent
 1,200
 or
 whatever
 it
 was,
 13
 to


this
 all-time
 high,
 49.
 3175
 is
 actually


a
 50%
 retracement.
 I
 would
 expect
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 um


there.
 32.


It's
 an
 okay
 discount.
 It's
 a
 good


discount.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 The
 thing
 is


if
 the
 if
 it
 gets
 there
 now,


I'm
 not
 so
 sure
 that
 that's
 actually


going
 to
 hold
 because


if
 this
 dip
 is
 not
 enough
 to
 get
 people


really
 interested
 to
 push
 this
 higher,
 I


don't
 think
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


enough
 either.
 I
 will
 say
 that.
 And
 and


in
 that
 case,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 expect


this
 general
 area,


which
 is
 from
 over
 here,
 to
 possibly
 be


in
 flash
 clash
 crash
 territory.


Um,


which
 would
 really
 kind
 of
 complete
 that


I
 corumba.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 an
 inverse


Iumba.


>> Would
 be
 quick
 too
 if
 that
 happens.


Super
 quick.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 it
 would
 be
 quick.
 just
 like


just
 like
 this
 was
 quick,
 right?
 This


was
 quick.
 They're
 all
 quick.
 And
 then


um
 these
 are
 always
 good
 for
 like
 these


are
 good
 pickups
 like
 this
 for
 both


short
 and
 long
 term.
 It's
 weird.
 So
 So


this
 is
 a
 good
 these
 are
 good
 pickups


when
 when
 I
 look
 at
 this
 is
 just
 my
 this


is
 not
 financial
 advice.
 This
 is
 just


how
 I
 view
 it.
 If
 I
 had
 a
 resting
 order


at
 say
 3500,
 which
 fortunately
 my
 order


was
 not
 working.
 Hopefully
 you
 guys
 had


some
 orders
 working.
 I
 mean,
 two
 things.


Roy
 was
 talking
 about
 the
 gas
 fees.


That's
 the
 one
 biggest
 cause
 for
 concern


that
 I
 have
 about
 Ethereum
 in
 general


because
 when
 the
 traffic
 gets
 heavy,


it's
 not
 efficient.
 It's
 not
 efficient


anyway
 you
 slice
 it.
 Which
 is
 why
 I'm


AVAC
 maxi.
 Um


uh
 but
 but
 these
 here
 um
 these
 can
 be


really
 good
 building
 blocks
 to


accumulate
 on
 and
 in
 the
 near
 term
 yeah


you
 can
 get
 this
 a
 huge
 bounce
 like
 that


is
 a
 giant
 bounce.
 Uh
 that
 is
 a
 21%


bounce.
 But
 you
 still
 need
 to
 be


somewhat
 cautious
 cuz
 we
 don't
 know
 that


this
 is
 the
 absolute
 lows,
 which
 is
 why


I
 use
 the
 the
 the
 phrase
 building
 blocks


because
 it's
 a
 good
 dip
 by
 you
 still


have
 the
 potential
 of
 getting
 another


one
 or
 two


in
 the
 in
 in
 the
 future.
 So
 it's
 it's


like,
 okay,
 cool.
 We've
 come
 back
 up
 to


resistance
 level
 at
 4200
 and
 that
 20-day


simple.
 I
 think
 you
 could
 trim
 this
 a


little
 bit
 if
 you
 did
 catch
 either
 one


of
 these.
 I
 think
 you
 I
 think
 you
 could


trim
 this
 if
 you
 caught
 this
 30
 35.


Okay.


This
 just
 me.
 But,
 you
 know,
 have


something
 I
 I
 think
 just
 not
 don't
 blow


your
 load
 yet.
 Is
 this
 possible
 that


there's
 another
 It's
 possible
 that


there's
 another
 dip
 to
 come.
 If
 you


don't
 have
 enough
 and
 you
 just
 need
 to


continue
 to
 accumulate,


just
 continue
 to
 accumulate
 and
 just


know
 that
 somewhere
 below
 32
 down
 to
 25


is
 a
 better
 loading
 zone
 is
 your
 next


not
 better
 is
 your
 next
 kind
 of
 loading


zone.
 And
 that
 would
 be
 my
 take


close
 to
 28.
 32


and
 28.
 So
 one


one
 two
 obviously


size
 being
 larger
 down
 here.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 I
 mean
 we
 might
 as
 well
 do


Bitcoin
 after
 that.
 So
 what
 do
 you
 think


>> Biddy
 the
 Biddy?


So
 Biddy
 not
 as
 strong.


Decent
 Biddy
 just
 tagged
 it
 right
 there.


um
 more
 resilient
 holding
 109.
 Not
 as


not
 as
 uh
 not
 as
 big
 of
 a
 bounce,
 but


not
 as
 big
 of
 a
 sell-off
 either.


Play


tick
 tick
 tick
 tick
 tick.
 Um
 holding


what
 is
 this
 prior
 alltime
 highs?
 So


this
 is
 your
 pivot
 109


505


is
 it
 is
 a
 retest.


We
 weren't
 really
 interested
 in
 buying


the
 biddy
 dip,


but


>> I
 mean,
 dude,
 it
 got
 to
 106
 on
 Friday.


Haven't
 seen
 that
 since.


>> So,
 that's
 important
 to
 hold.
 If
 you


lose
 102,
 then
 it
 goes
 to
 96.
 That's
 a


for
 sure.


>> This
 would
 be,
 bro,
 Bitcoin
 under
 a
 100


into
 Q.


>> No,
 that's
 a
 for
 sure.
 Like,
 if
 you
 lose


the
 102,
 I
 say
 for
 sure
 as
 in
 like
 tech.


So
 in
 in
 crypto
 in
 in
 the
 cryptoverse


they
 don't
 have
 the
 same
 kind
 of


fundamentals.
 So
 what
 people
 should


understand
 is
 that
 if
 the
 in
 is
 that


crypto
 relies
 very
 heavily
 on
 technical


analysis.
 So
 if
 there
 was
 a
 there
 was
 a


land
 of
 self-fulfilling
 prophecies
 for


crypto
 it's
 it's
 here.
 Um
 I
 will
 say


that
 upside
 has
 has
 been
 achieved.
 So


that
 can
 go
 away.


Um,


and
 I
 think


yeah,
 this
 is
 let's
 do
 this.


This
 is
 from
 here
 to
 here.


Let's
 not
 measure
 that
 one.


What
 we
 need
 to
 measure
 is
 from


here


to
 here.
 And
 that
 is
 in
 fact
 still


giving
 me
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 level.
 This


is
 an
 extension


of
 this
 large


draw
 down.
 So
 meaning
 that
 yep
 if
 I
 have


multiple
 confluences
 that
 if
 102


5
 fails
 we
 should
 see
 around
 96
 possibly


92s


for
 the
 next
 level.


And
 that
 would
 hopefully
 set
 you
 up
 for


a
 bigger
 launch


like
 that.


into
 the
 eating
 season,
 which
 by
 the
 way


is
 is
 just
 around
 the
 corner.
 Happy


birthday,
 by
 the
 way.


>> It's
 not
 my
 birthday,
 but
 I
 appreciate


it.


>> Will
 be
 two
 weeks.


>> Very
 close.


>> It's
 not
 It's
 barely
 two
 weeks,
 man.


It's
 less
 than
 two
 weeks
 away.


>> That's
 true.
 It's
 It's
 13
 days.


>> He's
 gonna
 be
 40,
 you
 guys.
 It's
 crazy.


life
 is
 coming.


I'm


always


so
 this
 is
 a
 good
 it's
 a
 good
 hold
 right


here
 but
 um
 and
 it
 is
 a
 higher
 high
 but


we
 have
 this
 is
 important
 sorry


we
 have
 we
 have
 entered
 price
 discovery


uh
 oh
 we've
 entered
 price
 discovery
 man


I
 just
 uh
 oh
 I
 just
 realized
 that
 we


have
 we
 have
 indeed
 entered
 price


discovery
 mode
 on
 the
 biddy


>> to
 the
 downside


>> no
 broadening
 formation
 you
 know
 this


megaphone.
 Um
 so
 again
 confluence
 is


down
 here
 towards
 the
 lows
 of
 this


um
 which
 then
 sets
 this
 trajectory
 still


in
 play


but
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is
 price


discovery
 what
 that
 looks
 like.
 So
 a


price
 discovery
 is
 a
 series
 of
 higher


highs
 and
 a
 series
 of
 higher
 lows.
 So
 uh


different
 than
 consolidation
 where


consolidation
 is
 higher
 highs
 or


consolidation
 is
 lower
 highs
 and
 higher


lows
 where
 the
 range
 is
 getting
 smaller.


Price
 discovery
 is
 the
 opposite
 where


you
 have
 both
 higher
 higher
 high
 but
 you


have
 a
 low
 lower
 low
 and
 lower
 low.
 So


the
 range
 itself
 is
 getting
 wider.
 This


is
 actually
 not
 the
 it's
 not
 a
 bad


setup.
 just
 means
 more
 volatility.
 Um,


but
 also


bigger
 range.
 Well,
 more
 volatility.


This
 is
 kind
 of
 exciting.


This
 is
 fun
 times
 for
 crypto,


not
 going
 to
 lie.


>> Okay,


>> this
 is
 this
 is
 where
 it
 can
 get
 wild.
 I


just
 just
 to
 circle
 back
 on
 you.
 Do
 we


have
 that?


We
 kind
 of
 have
 that.


>> I
 mean,
 dude,
 the
 thing
 about
 this
 that


I
 think
 is
 confusing
 people
 is
 you
 got


the
 big
 names
 saying
 200k
 Bitcoin,


10,000
 ETH,
 and
 they're
 they're
 so
 far


away
 and
 there's
 and
 they
 keep
 they're


pretty
 even
 Arthur
 Hayes,
 who's
 a
 crypto


OG,
 he
 said
 by
 end
 of
 year,
 we
 will
 see


200
 Bitcoin
 and
 10,000
 Ethereum.
 We
 got


two
 months
 left
 until
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 So,
 that
 would
 have
 to
 be
 an


explosive
 move
 if
 that
 actually
 plays


out.


Um,
 yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it
 could
 be,
 but


it's
 predicated
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


happening.
 Here's
 the
 current
 channel.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 expansion
 on


Ethereum.


This
 looks
 I
 mean,
 honestly,
 I
 don't
 see


a
 reason
 I
 What
 I
 don't
 see
 is
 I
 don't


see
 So,
 we're
 going
 a
 little
 bit
 over


time,
 but
 I
 do
 not
 see
 a
 reason
 to
 sell


any
 Ethereum


or
 Bitcoin.
 Both
 of
 these
 are
 just
 me


looking
 like
 how
 big
 of
 a
 how
 big
 of
 a


giant
 discount
 can
 I
 possibly
 get?
 Um


how
 greedy
 do
 I
 want
 to
 be?
 And
 you


know,
 in
 in
 certain
 situations,
 like
 I
 I


might
 I
 might
 want
 to
 be
 greedy,
 but
 um


but
 this
 is
 that
 kind
 of
 consolidation


triangle
 in
 here
 that
 I
 had
 more
 or
 less


highlighted
 earlier
 that
 like,
 okay,
 if


you
 get
 these
 crazy
 wicks,
 I
 would


expect
 it
 to
 bounce
 back
 into
 even
 if


you
 got
 a
 wick
 down
 to
 here,
 I
 would


expect
 it
 to
 bounce
 back
 up
 into
 you.


and
 35
 to
 be
 for
 sure
 general
 support
 if


this
 doesn't
 just
 completely
 start
 to


face
 rip
 now.
 But
 all
 of
 this
 all
 of
 it


to
 me
 is
 you
 want
 to
 posture


slowly
 by
 slowly


I
 say
 slowly
 by
 slow
 slowly
 but
 slowly


just
 nibble


at
 little
 tidbits


building
 building
 blocks.
 So
 I
 would
 use


these
 up
 as
 opportunistic
 building


blocks,
 these
 flash
 crashes.


>> All
 right.


>> The
 lab
 of
 rockets.
 Electron.


Neutron.


>> Dude,
 it
 broke
 73
 last
 week.


>> Dude,
 it's
 right
 there.
 Like
 what
 what


are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 with
 this
 thing?


This
 thing
 is
 like
 to
 the
 moon.
 M


>> I
 I
 am
 I
 am
 not
 selling,
 but
 I'm
 not


buying
 here.


>> I'm
 not
 selling.


>> But
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 that's
 you
 too,


right?
 Are
 you
 are
 you
 buying?


>> No,
 that's
 all
 a
 sizing
 thing
 cuz
 it's


cuz
 we're
 not
 like
 over
 we're
 not
 like


size
 to
 the
 hilts
 either.
 Um,


so


I


wow.


This
 is
 momentum.


I
 mean,
 bro,
 it's
 Yeah,
 there's


definitely
 some
 momentum
 here.
 I
 mean,


like


70
 B.
 That
 is
 massive
 for
 Rocket
 Life.


That
 is


>> I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 this.
 Should
 I


should
 I
 have
 bought
 more?
 I
 don't
 have


a
 problem
 buying
 more
 is
 my
 other
 thing


cuz
 I
 I
 don't
 mind
 it
 when
 something


goes
 into
 real
 price
 discovery
 like
 from


a
 fundamental
 price
 discovery


perspective
 which
 is
 what
 Rocket
 Lab
 is


in
 cuz
 you
 know
 things
 can
 just
 get


weird
 sometimes.


And
 uh
 low
 float
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


mind
 getting


>> Let
 me
 check
 it
 short
 float.
 How
 much
 is


it
 still?
 was
 a
 low
 float
 is
 for
 sure.


Um
 is
 still
 shorted
 14%.


>> Dude,
 that's
 enough
 for
 a
 squeeze
 if
 it


really
 gets
 there.
 That
 could
 happen.


>> It
 is


near
 80
 at
 least.
 Just
 that's
 not
 even
 a


near
 80
 is
 not
 even
 a
 squeeze.
 So
 this


is
 our
 measurement
 from
 this
 last


consolidation
 area


here.


And
 it's
 on
 trajectory.
 It
 was
 on


trajectory
 first
 stop
 63.
 And
 you
 know


when
 we
 do
 this
 we
 always
 say
 look
 it's


got
 to
 hold
 these
 levels
 and
 those
 those


prior
 resistance
 levels
 they
 need
 to
 act


as
 support.
 That's
 exact
 they
 need
 to


act
 as
 support
 and
 as
 long
 as
 the
 stock


acts
 right


it
 can
 go
 on
 to
 the
 next
 rung
 here.
 And


good
 lord
 this
 stock
 is
 acting
 right
 cuz


that
 is
 exactly
 what
 you
 want
 to
 see.


And
 so
 that
 means
 that
 over
 6865,


this
 little
 area
 right
 here


on
 the
 same
 path,


trajectory
 path,
 what
 has
 been
 outlined


and
 where
 we
 still
 are,
 the
 next
 stop


7850


um


probably
 single
 day
 session.


>> That'd
 be
 pretty
 incredible.


So
 that's
 a
 13%
 day
 incoming
 for
 the


Alava
 rockets.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


catalyst
 is.


Um
 and
 then
 possibly
 8380,
 but
 the
 8380


is
 is
 uh
 is
 all
 I
 have
 here.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I
 can
 get
 some
 confluence.
 Um
 this
 is


getting
 a
 bit
 wild.
 Yeah,
 I
 do
 have


confluence.


I
 mean,
 Jesus,
 that's
 right
 there
 just


on
 this
 one
 kill
 candle
 of
 a
 day.


It's
 it's
 it's
 doubling.


That's
 that's
 extra
 added
 confluence.
 I


have
 I
 have
 momentum
 increasing
 here.


Oh,
 goodness.


>> We're
 going
 to
 make
 Jason
 buy.


>> Oh,
 dude.
 This
 is
 gross.
 Daily
 squeeze.


All right.
 Daily
 is
 kind
 of
 coming
 kind


of
 a
 little
 weak,
 but
 weekly
 squeeze,


technical
 squeeze.


>> What?
 What
 do
 you
 mean?


>> Technical
 squeeze
 on
 a
 oscillator


oscillator
 perspective.
 So
 like


it's
 Oops.


That's
 this
 like
 it's
 in
 an
 active
 uh


this
 green
 bar.
 It
 should
 not
 have


necessarily
 gone
 green
 right
 away


because
 it
 went
 red
 green
 like
 boom
 boom


um
 over
 the
 this
 is
 it
 just
 that's


that's
 uh
 that's
 what
 that
 means.
 It's


just
 it's
 just
 uh
 momentum
 continuing
 to


the
 upside.
 If
 this
 was
 an
 RSI,


I
 got
 40
 seconds.
 See
 if
 I
 can
 do
 this.


If
 this
 was
 an
 RSI,
 there
 it
 is.
 What


that
 would
 be
 is
 essentially
 something


getting
 back
 over
 the
 70
 on
 a
 daily,


probably
 also
 weekly.
 Yep.
 Is
 right


here.


So,
 it's
 this
 moment


when
 you
 get
 into
 overbought
 and
 you


become
 even
 more
 overbought.


That's
 that's
 that
 kind
 of
 momentum


squeeze
 when
 you're
 already
 overbought,


but
 you
 come
 you
 become
 more
 overbought.


I
 made
 it
 in
 time.
 Look
 at
 that.
 All


right.
 Next.
 Someone
 also
 says,
 "If


Rocket
 Lab
 gets
 the
 next
 transfer
 of


their
 contract,
 it
 would
 be
 75%
 of
 their


current
 revenue.
 The
 government
 shutdown


is
 stopping
 that
 announcement,
 which


could
 be
 a
 catalyst."
 Okay,
 there
 you


go.


It
 makes
 sense.


>> 70%
 of
 your
 revenue.


>> So
 they
 do
 500
 million
 in
 revenue.
 Call


it
 give
 or
 take
 50
 million.


>> Yeah.
 But
 it's
 a
 32
 billion
 market
 cap.


Now
 we
 were
 supposed
 to
 do
 this.
 This


was
 supposed
 to
 be
 the
 10bagger.
 Ribbon


was
 supposed
 to
 hold
 it
 hold
 its
 own


which
 it's
 not.


>> Rock
 lab
 destroyed
 Rivian.
 That's


>> dude.
 It's
 no
 contest.
 All
 right.
 We
 are


over
 time
 but
 um
 but
 dude
 this
 is
 what
 a


huge
 winner.
 This
 is
 one
 where
 it's


like,
 listen,


you
 you
 you
 let
 your
 winners
 run.


Sometimes
 you
 even
 press
 your
 bets
 on


the
 winners.
 It's
 uh
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a


winner.
 It's
 sometimes
 not


uh
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


>> Yeah.


>> Until
 something
 changes,
 but
 right
 now


it's
 acting
 right.


>> Uh
 by
 the
 way,
 Hercules
 Jack,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 788
 Hong
 Kong
 dollars.
 I
 think


that's
 about
 100
 US.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for


that
 super
 chat.
 How
 do
 you
 do
 that


math?


>> Dude,
 there's
 something
 called
 Gemini.


It's
 actually
 really


useful.


>> Uh,
 Navius,
 what
 are
 we
 thinking
 there?


>> I
 thought
 8.88
 was
 the
 lucky
 number.


>> Um,


should
 asked
 for
 a
 $700
 refund,
 so
 you


just
 give
 him
 the
 88
 because
 that's
 also


good,
 Nebius,
 dude.
 Okay,
 so
 that
 was


the
 that
 was
 a
 buy.


So
 restart
 timer.
 So
 this
 is
 I
 mean


definitively


what
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


is
 it's
 Nebius,
 right?


>> I
 call
 it
 Nebius,
 but


>> I
 know
 but
 Jensen
 called
 it
 nebius.


>> Did
 he?
 Okay.
 Well,
 maybe


maybe
 it's
 Nebius.


>> Nebvious.
 Um,


so
 we
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pullback.
 I


mean,
 dude,
 it's
 uh


I
 think
 again
 again
 again


this.


I
 still
 have
 this
 147


intact.


We
 already
 hit
 the
 120
 pullback.


>> It
 hit
 107
 I
 think
 on
 Friday.


>> Well,
 yeah.
 And
 last
 Tuesday,
 technical


Tuesday,


last
 technical
 Tuesday,
 it
 was
 sitting


right
 here.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 this
 is
 a
 buy


in
 terms
 of
 accumulation


here
 on
 this
 technical
 day.
 I'll
 just


circle
 it
 and
 I'll
 put
 another
 green


arrow
 and
 I'll
 say
 it
 again.
 I
 think


it's
 a
 buy
 technically
 speaking
 as
 long


as
 it's
 traversing
 this
 and
 it's
 going


to
 145.
 It's
 a
 little
 choppy
 up
 here,


but
 it's
 it's
 actually
 acting
 right.


So,
 I
 mean,
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 where


I'm
 at.
 Like,
 as
 long
 as
 it's
 acting


right,


then
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 reason
 to


to
 change
 anything.
 It
 could
 get
 to
 125,


but
 it
 is
 for
 all
 intents
 and
 purposes


right
 there
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 golden


zone.
 Let's
 see
 just
 from
 this
 one
 spot


where
 it
 would


Yeah,
 I
 I
 have
 it
 again.
 It's
 right
 in


that
 145.
 This
 is
 saying
 150.
 That's
 a


little
 aggressive.


It's
 still
 saying
 150.


It's
 still
 saying
 150.
 It's
 got
 to
 deal


with
 150.
 Dude,


>> I
 mean,
 they
 basically
 quintupled
 their


revenues
 after
 the
 Microsoft
 deal.
 So,


>> yeah.
 The
 only
 thing
 you
 don't
 want
 to


see
 this
 do
 is
 lose
 120.
 At
 this
 point,


if
 it
 loses
 120,
 then
 this
 has
 been
 such


a
 staircase
 clean
 trend
 up,
 then
 you


will
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pullback


heavy
 probably.


And
 in
 that
 case,
 you're
 probably
 going


to
 see
 that
 full
 retest


into
 those


um
 105s.


Okay.


Um,
 going
 back
 to
 space
 ESTs,
 this
 one


broke
 alltime
 highs
 today.


Any
 thoughts
 on
 this
 one?
 The
 thoughts


of
 the
 space
 crew,
 man.
 It's
 just
 like
 I


don't
 know
 where
 these
 moon
 missions
 are


coming
 from,
 but
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the


same
 thing.
 Look,
 look,
 look,
 look,


look.
 Okay,
 a
 lot
 of
 lines
 on
 this


chart.
 I
 know,
 but
 um


I'm
 I'm
 all
 getting
 excited
 about
 this


stuff,
 man.
 But
 this
 is
 this
 is
 this
 is


what
 I
 mean
 by
 when
 it's
 acting
 right.


And
 I
 think
 last
 Tuesday,
 this
 little


green
 line
 was
 from
 last
 Tuesday.
 It


wasn't
 even
 here
 last
 Tuesday,
 but
 it


was
 your
 target
 acquired
 here.
 If
 it


hits
 it,
 it
 it
 hits


I
 mean
 people
 should
 just
 be


screenshotting
 our
 charts
 at
 this
 point.


This
 is
 crazy.


No,
 but
 this
 one
 fell
 to
 36
 three
 weeks


ago,
 too.


>> I'm
 still
 I'm
 just
 using
 the
 same
 uh


charts,
 by
 the
 way.
 So,
 I've
 saved
 this


kind
 of
 layout,
 but
 um
 pulls
 back
 and


then
 boom,


target


acquired.
 So,
 acting
 right,


which


you
 know


that
 puts
 this
 at
 like


just
 under
 110
 at
 this
 point.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 we're
 not
 just
 saying
 this
 is
 a


this
 is
 a
 ginormous
 extension
 from
 way


down
 here
 though
 is
 what
 I'm
 still


using.
 That's
 what
 this
 extension
 is.


This
 retest
 never
 showed
 up.


Um
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 show
 up.


And
 if
 I
 just
 do
 a
 quickie


here,


same
 thing.


I
 mean,


dude,
 if
 it's
 acting
 right.
 So,
 this


looks
 like
 it
 looks
 like
 this.


And
 then


target


you
 know,
 and
 at
 that
 point
 it
 could


come
 down
 again


and
 do
 another
 little
 thing.


But
 like
 that,


>> by
 the
 way,
 you
 know
 how
 much
 revenue


these
 guys
 do?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 $100.


>> Less.


less
 than
 100,


>> dude.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 obviously
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 potential.
 What
 I
 what


I
 will
 say
 is
 like
 uh
 Rocket
 Lab,


Redwire
 I
 I
 think
 slowed
 down
 for
 our


company
 for
 the
 manufacturing
 facility,


but
 at
 the
 time
 I
 don't
 remember
 if
 I


told
 you
 this
 or
 not,
 but
 I
 think
 AS
 was


down
 here
 or
 it
 might
 have
 been
 in
 this


in
 this
 general
 area,
 but
 these
 guys


showed
 up
 out
 of
 the
 blue
 and
 got
 real


busy.


>> Yeah.


on
 the
 man
 for
 the
 manufacturing


company.


>> Partnership
 with
 Verizon
 will
 do
 that


too,
 you
 know.
 So,
 I
 mean,


it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 the
 space
 TAM
 is


slowing
 down
 at
 all.


So,
 makes
 sense.
 Um,
 okay.
 Can
 we
 can
 we


get
 this
 one
 out
 of
 the
 way?
 Energy


fuels.
 You
 you
 you
 do
 you
 know
 this
 one?


>> Yeah,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 can
 get


out
 of
 the
 way
 without
 talking
 just


uranium
 in
 general.


>> Let's
 do
 it.
 Go
 for
 it.
 Um,
 well,
 I


mean,
 so
 this
 is,
 uh,
 so
 again,
 I'm


going
 to
 put
 this
 in
 the
 box
 of
 if
 you


were
 around
 during
 the
 Biden


administration
 and
 the
 plug
 power
 fuel


cell
 energy
 rally
 for
 clean
 energy,


this
 is
 the
 same
 thing,
 right?
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that
 they
 can
 just


continue
 to
 be
 absolutely
 just
 just


jaw-dropping
 moves.


um
 I'll
 go
 ahead
 and
 do
 this.
 It
 doesn't


have
 to
 make
 sense
 fundamentally.
 I


don't
 think
 that
 you
 should
 think
 that


um
 any
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 going
 to
 happen


anytime
 soon.
 It's
 it's
 not
 um
 it
 may


not
 ever
 happen,
 but
 that's
 not
 what
 is


moving
 these
 stocks,
 Oaklo
 and
 the
 like.


It's
 policy
 uh
 and
 it's
 in
 its
 market


sentiment.
 So,
 right
 now
 I
 have
 32.
 Um


you
 have
 some
 gaps.
 The
 the
 test
 here
 is


19.


Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 think
 this
 is


duh.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 doing
 it.


And
 this
 is
 from
 this
 prior.
 Yeah.


Do
 we
 really
 need
 to
 do
 this?
 I
 think
 we


need
 to
 go
 in
 here.


There
 is
 a
 stock
 that
 I
 used
 to
 follow.


chat,
 tell
 me
 if
 anybody
 knows
 what
 this


stock
 is
 called
 AQMS


that
 has
 just
 been
 on
 an
 absolute
 ripper


the
 last
 two
 days.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 I
 I


can't
 believe
 that
 that
 stock
 is
 hitting


the
 tape
 right
 now.


Does
 anybody
 know
 this


>> 21
 stock
 or
 no?


>> Uhhuh.
 Well,
 I
 used
 to
 trade
 it
 and
 I


actually
 know
 it.
 It's
 a
 clean
 energy


company,
 but


>> it
 was
 up
 200%
 today


>> and
 yesterday.


Goodness,
 bro.


>> Both
 days.


>> So,


>> because
 of
 this
 energy
 theme.
 That's
 the


reason.


>> Yeah.


>> Dude,
 it
 was
 a
 penny
 stock
 like


literally
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.


I
 mean,
 in
 the
 single
 digits.
 And
 I


think
 I
 saw
 it
 with
 like
 a
 near
 30


handle
 today.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 almost
 threw
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 my


mouth.
 I
 saw,
 oh
 my
 god.


Um,
 yeah,
 it's
 quite
 disgusting.


So,
 this
 looks
 this
 is
 holding
 to
 me.


This
 looks
 like
 possibly
 24
 pullbacks.


And
 yeah,
 and
 everything's
 showing
 me


30s
 on
 UU.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 be
 um,
 you


know,
 my
 Talon,


my
 Talon
 Energies
 is
 a
 is
 a
 smaller


midcap.
 Now,
 this
 has
 a
 nuclear
 reactor


in
 their
 portfolio.
 It's
 it's
 slower,


steadier.
 It's
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 nat
 gas
 and


some
 coal
 in
 there.
 Um,
 N&
 is
 the
 is
 the


one
 that
 has
 I
 I
 don't
 believe
 they
 they


have
 a
 facility
 that's
 they
 just
 I
 don't


know if
 they
 flipped
 a
 switch
 on
 this.


Um,


sorry
 I'm
 still
 using
 this
 time
 slot
 for


yuyu.
 But
 NE
 is
 another
 one
 that
 they


just
 I
 think
 they
 have
 a
 nuclear


facility
 that
 they
 simply
 just
 need
 to


flip
 the
 switch
 on
 to
 turn
 on.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they
 have
 or
 have
 not,
 but
 you'd


have
 to
 look
 into
 that
 and
 their
 on


their
 website.


Oh.


Oh
 no,


dude.


>> Did
 you
 not
 pay
 your
 Trading
 View
 bills?


Let's
 just
 get
 a
 Let's
 just
 get
 a
 uh


a
 paint
 application.
 You
 can
 just
 draw


your
 lines.


>> Paint
 location.


>> So,
 you
 think
 the
 nuclear
 names
 are


still
 in
 an
 uptrend
 and
 they're
 not?


>> I
 don't
 think.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can't
 argue


that
 they're
 still
 in
 an
 uptrend.


There's
 no
 argument
 to
 be
 had
 there.


Fundamentally,
 what
 I
 will
 say
 is
 that


they're
 they're
 they're they're


multi-deades


out
 from
 actually
 being
 very
 real.
 And


when
 you
 look
 at
 it,
 they're
 not
 they're


they're
 barely
 they're
 more
 efficient,


but
 they're
 not
 that
 more
 effic
 they're


not
 like
 but
 the
 the
 truth
 of
 the
 matter


is
 that
 nat
 gas
 facilities
 are
 the
 most


efficient
 um
 and
 the
 most
 abundant.
 But


people
 just
 don't
 like
 that.
 But
 that's


the
 truth
 about
 energy.
 Like
 it
 or
 not,


that's
 that's
 actually
 what's
 true.
 So


this
 I
 have
 67.
 Uu
 was
 the
 question
 that


um


uh
 I
 think
 is
 in
 the
 30s
 possibly


slightly
 higher.
 This
 one
 has
 momentum.


What's
 the
 other
 one?
 SMR


>> new
 scaler.


>> Uh
 SMR


is
 if
 it's
 too
 real,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


get
 the
 love.
 Oaklo
 um
 is
 more
 um


>> would
 you
 would
 you
 buy
 Oaklo
 here?


>> I
 mean
 you
 could
 trade
 it
 but
 yeah
 sure


why
 not
 like
 if
 you
 got
 to
 be
 in
 the


fantasy
 land
 because
 it's
 not


duted


>> but
 would
 you
 buy
 it
 as
 an
 investment


here?


>> No.
 Um
 but
 so
 if
 you
 if
 you


>> like
 a
 trade
 up
 to
 200
 would
 you
 you


would
 take
 that
 trade


>> positional
 trade?
 Yes,


>> I
 would.
 So
 investment
 if
 we
 if
 we
 if
 we


categorize
 investment
 in
 terms
 of
 time


horizon
 thinking
 3
 to
 5
 years
 minimum


no
 but
 less
 than
 3
 years
 yes
 could
 that


be
 two
 years?
 Yes.
 I
 would
 say
 with


during
 the
 full
 administration,


I
 think
 it
 could
 continue
 to
 have
 legs,


but
 if
 Democrats
 come
 in,
 you
 probably


got
 an
 exit
 stage
 left.


>> That's
 fair.


>> I
 think
 it's
 uh
 so
 so
 investment
 in


terms
 of
 does
 it
 qualify
 for
 short-term


games?
 Maybe,
 maybe
 not.
 But
 it
 this
 is


a
 policy
 and
 a
 posture
 thing.
 We
 call


this
 a
 positional
 trade.
 So
 it's
 I
 want


to
 have
 this
 type
 of
 position


um
 which
 may
 last
 more
 than
 a
 year
 uh
 in


this
 in
 this
 type
 of
 thing
 knowing
 full


well
 that
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 fantasy
 land
 um


because
 it
 it
 is
 very
 much
 about
 policy


and
 position.


>> Yeah,
 that
 makes
 sense.
 It
 makes
 a
 lot


of
 sense.
 But
 but
 the
 term
 investing
 in


terms
 of
 is
 it
 a
 money
 seed
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 plant
 to
 grow
 a
 money
 tree


that's
 going
 to
 provide
 money
 bearing


fruit
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life?
 No,
 not


necessarily.
 But
 for
 can
 it
 grow
 really


tall,
 really
 fast,
 um,
 and
 provide
 a


couple
 seasons
 of
 like
 some
 really


killer
 fruit.
 Yeah,
 maybe.


>> Google


gigs,


how
 are
 we
 on
 the
 shot
 clock?


>> Doing
 good.
 Put
 I
 mean,
 put
 a
 W
 in
 the


chat
 if
 you
 like
 the
 flow.
 I
 think
 the


flow
 is
 working
 really
 well.
 So,
 not
 too


bad.


>> Faster,
 shorter.


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 five
 minutes
 is
 perfect.


I
 think
 it's
 perfect.


>> I'm
 just
 seeing
 more.
 Um


Oh,
 I
 got
 to
 You
 got
 to
 use
 Oh,
 W's.


Okay.
 Cannot
 use
 Streamyard.
 It's
 got
 to


be
 on
 this.
 So,
 googs
 less
 less
 245
 is


still
 a
 bullish
 hold,
 my
 guy.
 Um
 it's


testing
 though.
 This
 what
 to
 do
 with
 the


googs.


This
 is
 a
 tough
 call
 right
 here
 and
 now


>> is
 it?
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 just
 you
 hold


till
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 You
 don't


really
 stress
 that
 much
 about
 it.


>> They're
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 good


earnings.
 Search
 is
 not
 dead.
 It's


holding
 240s
 really
 well,


>> right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 so
 uh
 so
 different
 hats,


right?
 trading,
 investing,
 swing


trading,
 position
 trading,
 different


time
 horizons.
 Um,
 the
 question
 is,
 do


you
 get
 another
 dip?
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 that's
 the
 only
 question.


That's
 the
 only
 question
 in
 mind.
 Do
 you


get
 another
 one?
 And
 is
 it
 a
 good
 enough


dip
 to
 actually
 go
 after
 it?


I
 don't
 know
 that
 it's
 it
 would
 have
 to


be
 an
 opportunistic
 dip.
 Like,
 if
 I
 saw


it,
 it'd
 have
 to
 be
 real
 nice.
 And
 I


mean
 like
 real
 nice
 because
 we
 might


have
 gotten
 it


because
 it's
 225


based
 on
 my
 calculations.


But
 here
 now
 it's
 it's
 at
 the
 pivot.
 245


is
 the
 pivot.
 We
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a


liquidity
 grab.


So
 we
 we
 do
 what
 I
 say
 hard
 call
 hard


call.
 Not
 from
 a
 fundamental


perspective.
 is
 not
 a
 hard
 call,
 but
 we


do
 have
 a
 couple
 lower
 lows,
 lower


highs,
 and
 we
 do
 in
 fact
 have
 a
 couple


lower
 lows.
 So,
 it's
 losing
 some
 steam


now.
 Can
 it
 go
 up
 and
 out
 right
 here,


right
 now?
 This
 right
 there
 becomes
 a


net
 new
 trade
 that
 maybe
 your
 boy
 can


partake
 in.
 I
 would
 like
 that.
 I
 would


like
 that
 very
 much
 because
 we
 still


have
 265s
 on
 deck
 still
 from
 our
 our


other
 ones,
 but
 we're
 not
 out
 of
 the


woods
 yet.
 In
 the
 meantime,
 since
 we're


at
 the
 tippy
 top
 of
 this
 range,
 do
 I


also
 have
 an
 opportunity
 to
 get
 a
 better


entry?
 See
 what
 I'm
 saying?


And
 do
 I
 get
 this
 um
 225


type
 entry
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 the
 current


channel


right
 here?
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 all
 I'm


trying
 to
 say
 is
 that
 there's
 a


possibility
 of
 a
 if
 a
 day
 trade.
 This
 is


just
 a
 day
 trade.
 This
 is
 not
 anything.


Um,
 which
 is
 losing
 that
 240.
 I
 would


say
 242
 and
 a
 half
 in
 strength.
 Um,


that's
 like
 a
 one
 and
 done
 kind
 of
 like


whoopsy
 daisy
 slipped,
 but
 then
 looking


for
 a
 base
 somewhere
 between
 230
 and


225.
 I
 I
 really
 like
 that
 for
 a


discounted
 entry.
 Although
 I
 will
 say


when
 we
 talk
 about
 Amazon,
 there's
 this


other
 thing
 since
 I
 got
 a
 minute
 and
 a


half.
 There's
 this
 other
 thing
 that


happens
 uh
 that's
 even
 more
 kind
 of


exciting
 for
 me
 about
 like
 the
 the


Amazon
 thing
 is
 whenever
 Google


historically
 is
 more
 expensive
 than


Amazon,
 you
 usually
 buy
 Amazon
 and


that's
 a
 good
 trade
 long
 term
 just
 just


from
 a
 numbers
 thing.
 Like
 if
 you
 look


back
 and
 it's
 like,
 oh
 yeah,
 whenever
 it


was
 like
 you
 kind
 of
 just
 like
 flip
 it.


So
 like
 this
 this
 could
 be
 a
 good
 setup.


This
 could
 be
 a
 a
 this
 is
 a
 better
 for


if
 something
 weird
 happens,
 some


shenanigans
 for
 whatever
 reason,


something
 just
 odd
 happens.
 I'm
 This
 is


a
 very
 interesting
 spot
 for
 me,


especially
 after
 a
 long
 kind
 of
 like


exhaustion.
 If
 people
 get
 tired
 trying


to
 press
 short-term
 bets
 and
 they
 get


just
 fed
 up,
 you
 might
 see
 a
 exhaustion


which
 is
 which
 might
 be
 exactly
 what


could
 be
 needed
 near
 term.
 Um,
 but
 if
 it


doesn't,
 we'll
 know
 and
 it's
 going
 to


look
 exactly
 like
 this.
 So,
 all
 this


said,
 something
 is
 brewing
 on
 Google.
 I


think
 a
 trade
 is
 coming.
 which
 direction


is
 hard
 to
 say
 just
 yet.
 Um
 but
 this
 is


now
 going
 to
 go
 on
 a
 closer
 um


magnifying
 glass
 for
 me
 after
 a
 30-day


sideways
 price
 action.
 I
 think
 this
 is


this
 has
 got
 a
 this
 has
 got
 a
 trade


brewing.


It's
 coming
 up
 nearing.


>> Okay,
 Meta.


>> Well,
 we
 we
 warned
 of
 it.
 Um
 it's
 7:30.


I
 did
 take
 one
 short
 on
 Friday.
 This
 was


it
 though.
 But
 it
 was
 just
 a
 one.
 It's
 a


day
 trade.
 One
 and
 done.


Um


but
 it
 hit
 that
 7:30


5
 area


right
 here.
 And
 in
 fact,
 we
 did
 see


those
 prior
 buyers
 turn
 into
 sellers
 at


least
 for
 the
 day.
 It
 does
 happen
 to
 to


align
 with
 for
 whatever
 reason.
 And
 I


don't
 know
 why
 TA
 and
 and
 newsflow


tend
 to
 align
 with
 each
 other,
 but
 this


was
 the
 concern
 that
 we
 had
 outlined


last
 week
 of
 even
 buying
 down
 here
 that


you
 get
 this
 that
 looks
 really
 good
 for


a
 couple
 days
 and
 you
 run
 into
 basically


resistance.
 And
 for
 for
 the


non-technical
 folk,
 all
 that
 resistance


is
 is
 that
 where
 people
 that
 bought
 in


the
 past,
 specifically
 here,


and
 who
 are
 stuck
 in
 these
 longer
 long


positions,
 have
 an
 opportunity
 to
 exit


for
 basically
 break
 even.


Especially
 if
 the
 chart
 has
 turned
 on


them,
 which
 it
 had,


it's
 likely
 that
 they
 turn
 into
 sellers.


those
 old
 buyers
 turn
 into
 sellers
 at


the
 at
 the
 moment
 that
 they
 have
 an


opportunity
 to
 exit
 stage
 left
 for
 a


near
 zero
 loss.
 And
 that's
 uh
 I
 think


that's
 what
 that's
 all
 that
 we
 saw
 on


Friday.
 It
 just
 happened
 to
 coincide


with
 with
 whatever.
 Um
 at
 this
 point


though,
 it's
 it's
 basically
 kind
 of


unchanged.
 still
 holding
 here,


but
 not
 um
 here
 as
 in
 sevens.
 I
 think


you
 let
 this
 base
 out
 a
 little
 bit.
 I


would
 say
 below
 seven


and
 then
 another
 little


pullback.
 So,
 we
 still
 I
 still
 want
 to


see
 this
 come
 down.


Uh
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 now
 is
 probably


the
 first
 time
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 on


the
 show
 is
 I'm
 actually
 going
 to
 do
 a


bearish
 extension
 because
 the
 the
 chart


is
 just
 bearish.
 It's
 the
 same
 thing


that
 we
 do
 on
 the
 upside
 but
 on
 the


downside
 for
 the
 bears.


And
 that
 is
 going
 to
 take
 me
 just


underneath
 the
 200
 day
 to
 660


fives
 right
 in
 here.


>> Which
 which
 I
 think
 you
 would
 love
 to


buy
 660.


>> It's
 the
 200
 day.
 So
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 I
 I


would
 still
 what
 I
 would
 like
 to
 buy.
 I


would
 probably
 wait
 on
 this
 one
 too


because
 it's
 meta.
 It's
 got
 a
 much


higher
 beta
 than
 the
 rest.
 Um,


I'm
 still
 thinking
 620s


to
 be
 completely
 fair,
 but
 I
 I
 think


that's
 a
 greedy
 idea.


It's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 So,


you're
 probably
 right.
 I'll
 probably


grab
 um


I
 mean,
 I
 have
 Meta
 and
 I'm
 not
 selling


I'm
 not
 selling
 Meta.
 Um


the
 question
 is
 do
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 do
 I


want
 is
 Meta
 do
 I
 want
 to
 make
 Meta
 a


core
 position
 for
 this
 uh
 Q4
 launch
 for


the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally?
 All
 of
 this
 by


the
 way
 any
 selloff
 to
 me
 in
 my
 mind


just
 me
 uh
 is
 like
 positioning
 for
 the


Santa
 Claus
 rally
 now
 even
 though
 it's


only
 it's
 not
 even
 Amit's
 birthday


supposedly.


Um,
 but
 by
 Amit's
 birthday,
 we
 should
 be


in
 full
 swing
 preparation.
 This
 is
 all


this
 is
 all
 preparation
 for
 the
 big


show.
 So,
 do
 of
 of
 the
 Santa
 Claus


rally.
 And
 do
 I
 want
 to
 do
 I
 want
 to


have
 Meta
 be
 a
 core
 component
 of
 that


rally?
 Do
 I
 think
 that
 that
 happens?
 I


don't
 know
 this.
 You
 know what?
 Let's
 do


this.
 Uh,
 I
 have
 a
 minute.


I
 think
 if
 this
 whole
 thing
 breaks
 down


here,


you're
 right.
 625.


640.
 640.
 There
 it
 is.
 Okay.
 It's
 640.


That's
 where
 I'll
 do
 it.
 Final
 answer.


No
 phone
 a
 friend.


I
 mean
 meta
 right
 now
 forward
 earnings


is
 25
 times.
 So
 640
 you
 would
 get
 down


to
 that
 22
 23
 which
 is
 not
 that
 scary
 to


be
 honest.


>> Yeah.
 So
 and
 that
 that
 I
 think
 would
 be


so
 that
 is
 an
 extension
 of
 this.
 So


since
 we
 do
 have
 a
 potential
 bearish


break
 here


that's
 basically
 this


doubled


Let
 me
 see.
 Hang
 on.


So
 this
 here
 to
 here.


Am
 I
 being
 greedy?
 I
 could
 be
 being


greedy,
 dude.
 Okay.
 So
 this
 break
 is
 to


675


and
 the
 deep
 discount
 640.
 I
 will
 buy
 at


640.
 Final
 answer.


Um
 and
 is
 in
 the
 meantime.


All
 right.
 But
 they're
 going
 to
 twist
 my


arm
 at
 640
 if
 I
 see
 that
 for
 whatever


reason.


I'll
 just
 have
 to
 do
 it.


Close
 my
 eyes,
 plug
 my
 nose.


I
 don't
 really
 care.


That
 would
 be
 a
 stupid
 discount.
 That


would
 be
 a
 stupid
 spot.
 Otherwise,
 until


then,
 if
 we
 get
 back
 over
 735,
 that


remains
 that
 kind
 of
 intraday
 pivot
 or


intra
 pivot.
 All right,
 next.


>> All
 right,
 we'll
 do
 two
 more
 and
 then
 uh


we'll
 take
 a
 little
 break.


It
 does
 feel
 like
 we'll
 do
 two
 more,


take
 a
 little
 break,
 and
 then
 we'll
 get


into
 rapid
 fire.
 Um,


>> I
 guess
 let's
 do
 a
 favorite.
 Well,
 do


you
 have
 a
 pick
 of
 the
 week
 or
 no?


>> Oh,
 baby.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,


>> Home
 Depot.
 This
 is
 your
 pick
 of
 the


week.


>> So,
 I
 went
 I
 went
 um
 Uber
 long
 the


depot.
 So,
 there's
 the
 stat.
 My
 annual


trade.
 I
 have
 a
 Home
 Depot
 annual
 trade.


It's
 already
 well
 in
 underway.


This
 is
 a
 sleeper.
 You
 guys
 know
 I
 I've


talked
 about
 um
 the
 homebuilders
 for
 a


while.
 I
 think
 uh
 that
 pullback
 where


this
 runup
 was
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 front


running
 into
 the
 the
 cuts.
 This
 pullback


here
 happens
 to
 align


perfectly
 to
 that
 be
 that
 bullish


retracement.


If
 I
 were
 to
 use
 this
 as
 an
 example
 of


what
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 with
 waiting


for
 a
 a
 daily
 higher
 low
 below
 the
 200


day
 simple
 moving
 average,
 this
 is


exactly
 that.
 So
 this
 is
 exactly
 that.


Here's
 the
 200
 day
 simple
 moving


average,
 right?
 So
 I
 have
 a
 a
 lower
 low


here.
 I
 have
 a
 lower
 low
 here.
 I
 have


what
 we
 call
 a
 higher
 high
 break
 of


structure


right
 here.
 All
 below
 the
 200
 day
 moving


average.
 And
 then
 I
 have
 a
 higher
 low.


Locked
 in
 here.
 Locked
 in
 here.
 All
 of


that.
 Game
 on.
 Go
 for
 launch.
 I
 like


this
 here.
 So,
 this
 trade
 to
 me
 is
 is
 a


positional
 trade,
 especially
 after


commentary
 today.
 Um,
 I
 think
 it
 got
 a


little
 love.
 Can
 it
 can
 it
 chop
 around?


I
 I
 think
 it
 can.
 But
 this
 uh
 is
 a


positional
 trade.
 So,
 it's
 not
 it's
 not


weeks.
 Uh,
 it's
 not
 even
 a
 couple


months.
 It's
 it's
 maybe
 more
 than
 a


couple
 months.
 This
 target
 is
 in
 the


450s


early
 next
 year.
 Just
 started


the
 Home
 Depot.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 AIT
 just


just
 like
 completely
 uh
 bought
 out
 all


of
 their
 Halloween
 gear.
 So,
 they're
 now


sold
 out
 and
 they're
 already
 loading
 up


the
 Christmas
 trees
 and
 all
 the


ornaments
 and
 and
 and
 yep,
 they're
 going


to
 sell
 out
 of
 all
 the
 all
 the
 Christmas


trees
 soon
 enough.
 But
 there's
 a
 stat.


>> Is
 this
 also
 a
 a
 rate
 play
 like
 more


people?


>> It
 is
 a
 rate
 play
 as
 well.
 So,
 it's
 all


of
 the
 above.
 And
 there's
 a
 stat
 that
 if


you
 buy,
 you
 know,
 Home
 Depot


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


you
 know,
 90
 something%
 of
 the
 time


you're
 green
 by
 March.


by
 late
 by
 early
 Q2,
 late
 Q1.
 Um,


just
 what
 it
 is.
 So,
 feel
 free
 to
 look


that
 up.


So,
 a
 lot
 of
 confluence
 both
 um
 from
 a


technical
 perspective,
 pullback,
 retest


a
 lot.
 Um,
 it's
 positional
 in
 terms
 of


the
 rates.
 So,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 on
 that
 side


of
 this
 play.
 Um,
 I
 was
 I
 I
 actually


took
 this
 whole
 thing
 up.
 This
 is
 this


is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 if
 Tesla
 had
 fall


if
 Tesla
 fell
 here.
 Me
 picking
 Home


Depot
 up
 here,
 which
 was
 at
 the
 200
 day,


is
 the
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 picking


Tesla
 back
 up
 at
 the
 360s
 one
 more
 time


and
 I'd
 be
 getting
 I'd
 be
 getting
 all


bowled
 up
 here
 under
 the
 radar.
 It
 is


what
 it
 is.
 You
 know
 how
 I
 feel
 about


the
 home
 builders.
 I
 think
 it's
 a


positional
 situation
 for
 the


reaceleration
 of
 rate
 cuts
 to
 come.


Okay.


>> So,
 it's
 not
 not
 really
 a
 shortterm


thing.
 It's
 multi
 months.


>> All
 right.
 Last
 one
 before
 we
 take
 a


little
 break.
 SMCI,
 what
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 this
 one?


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 baby.
 Do
 you
 see
 the
 news?


>> Yeah,
 they
 have
 some
 new
 line
 of


business
 around
 service.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that's
 exactly
 what
 they


needed
 to
 do.
 I
 obviously
 the
 the


markets
 kind
 of
 like
 doesn't
 really


care.
 I
 like
 it.
 It's
 a
 technically
 it's


a
 lower
 high.


I
 still
 like
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 the
 the
 most
 ridiculous
 underpriced


AI
 stock
 in
 the
 market.
 That
 is
 not


going
 to
 change.
 I
 am
 positive
 that
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 at
 their
 absolute
 best


quarter
 they
 ever
 report.
 I
 don't
 care


what
 anybody
 has
 to
 say
 is
 just
 what's


going
 to
 happen.
 Quote
 me
 on
 it.
 Um
 but


the
 the
 what
 they
 reported
 today
 about


the
 new
 like
 about
 a
 new
 um
 offering
 is


important
 because
 that
 puts
 them
 more
 in


line
 with
 the
 Dell
 um
 situation.
 It
 it


just
 expands
 their
 margins.
 All right.


So
 uh
 data
 center
 building
 block


solutions.
 This
 gives
 them
 the
 ability


to
 to
 bundle
 um
 so
 they
 say
 building


servers.
 So,
 it
 bundles
 storage,


networking,
 and
 liquid
 cooling
 all


together
 in
 a
 single
 purchase
 and
 and


helps
 streamline
 a
 lot
 of
 deployments,


but
 it's
 it's
 this
 is
 a
 margin
 boosting


quicker
 deployment
 type
 offer.
 Whether


or
 not
 they
 sell
 a
 bunch,
 who
 knows?


But,
 um
 it's
 just
 it's
 at
 least


something
 that
 they're
 doing.


Um
 so,
 yeah,
 I
 like
 it.
 It's
 it's
 the


first
 it's
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 I've


I've
 heard
 of
 them
 doing
 that's
 actually


enterprise
 geared.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 more


strategic
 and
 it
 takes
 them
 a
 little
 bit


slightly
 out
 of
 that
 commodity
 play
 uh


that
 they
 were
 before.
 Uh
 that
 said,


this
 is
 a
 good
 spot.
 I
 like
 the
 spot


today.
 It's
 my
 it's
 my
 largest
 trade
 um


position
 by
 a
 mile.


Um
 good,
 bad,
 or
 indifferent.
 Can
 it


come
 down
 still?
 Yes,
 it
 can.
 Um,
 but
 I


I
 love
 it
 here.


I
 keep
 telling
 Emit
 because
 you
 guys
 are


talking
 about
 Pokemon
 cards.
 Like,
 and


someone
 said
 this
 in
 my
 server
 and
 it


might
 have
 come
 from
 you
 guys.
 I
 don't


know.
 But,
 um,
 you
 know,
 stock
 market
 is


not
 like
 Pokemon.
 You
 cannot
 catch
 them


all.
 So,
 I
 need
 to
 just
 focus
 on


catching
 my
 my
 Charizard
 or
 whatever
 it


is.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 one
 of
 them.


So,
 yeah,
 I
 like
 this
 a
 lot.
 I


absolutely
 want
 to
 be
 positioned
 here


for
 Q4.
 Um,
 if
 I
 see
 it
 close
 to
 that


20-day,
 as
 close
 to
 50
 as
 I
 can,
 that


would
 be
 my
 next
 pickup.
 But
 positioning


here,
 no
 question.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm
 not
 I'm


not
 being
 picky
 about
 my
 entries
 like
 at


all
 cuz
 I
 don't
 I'm
 on
 this
 one.
 It


could
 happen
 any
 day,
 especially
 with


the
 type
 of
 newsful
 that
 we're
 getting.


I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 trim
 around
 anything.


I'm
 literally
 just
 building


um
 because
 some
 crazy
 news
 flow
 can


happen
 like
 any
 moment
 and
 I
 don't
 want


to
 like
 be
 selling
 out
 of
 positions
 and


like
 get
 the
 get
 the
 headline
 middle
 of


the
 night
 and
 be
 like,
 "Oh
 crap,
 I


didn't
 have
 my
 position."
 So,
 I'm
 just


kind
 of
 nibbling
 on
 on
 these
 pullbacks.


I
 did
 nibble
 yesterday.
 Uh
 I
 did
 not


nibble
 today
 as
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 I'm


like
 well
 if
 it
 if
 it
 does
 pull
 back
 I


could
 see
 I
 could
 see
 this
 bigger


pullback
 right
 into
 retest
 uh
 just


around
 50
 which
 would
 be
 the
 cleanest


retest
 that
 we've
 seen
 since
 the


breakout
 which
 is
 literally
 4970.


So
 just
 under
 slightly
 under
 50
 but
 am
 I


waiting
 for
 that?
 No.
 Am
 I
 positioned


today?
 Yes.
 Will
 I
 get
 bigger?
 Yes.


Okay
 guys,
 we'll
 give
 Jason
 a
 fivem


minute
 break.
 Then
 we'll
 get
 into
 rapid


fire
 and
 uh
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from


there.
 So
 we'll
 let
 Jason
 use
 the


bathroom
 or
 anything
 else
 he
 he
 needs
 to


do.


>> Okay.
 What
 are
 we
 watching?


>> Well,
 no,
 we're
 not
 watching
 anything.


Actually,
 we're
 watching
 stocks.
 I
 mean,


do
 you
 have
 to
 use
 the
 bathroom
 or
 you


don't
 have
 to?


>> I'm
 good
 right
 now.


>> We
 can
 keep
 going.
 But
 we
 will
 take
 a


little
 second
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 to
 move
 after
 hours
 across


the
 board.
 S&P
 getting
 a
 green
 candle.


Nvidia
 getting
 a
 green
 candle.
 Iran


green
 candle.
 Rocket
 green
 candle.
 I


don't
 see
 a
 Trump
 tweet.


Um,


but


I
 don't
 know.
 Is
 this
 Algo
 driven?
 I


don't
 see
 a
 headline.
 It's
 not
 a
 massive


green
 candle,
 but
 pretty
 much
 every
 even


Robin
 Hood
 getting
 1%
 after
 hours.


Maybe
 soybeans
 don't
 matter.


that
 much
 anymore.


Uh
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 have
 anything
 from


Trump.
 Is
 he
 live?
 I
 mean,
 he
 was
 live


an
 hour
 ago.
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 really


took
 questions
 at
 the
 event
 he
 was
 live


at.
 It
 was
 a
 Medal
 of
 Freedom
 event.


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 know.


But
 you
 are
 getting
 a
 move
 after
 hours.


S&P.14.


I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 nice
 green
 candle.


It's
 not
 as
 high
 as
 it
 was
 right
 before


the
 soybean
 tweet,
 but


it
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 green
 than
 not.


I
 want
 my
 Chinese
 cooking
 oil.
 Dude,


that
 [ __ ]
 really
 messed
 up
 the
 market


close.
 Yeah,
 Trump's
 son
 already
 closes


puts.


I
 don't
 have
 a
 headline.
 If
 anyone
 has


it,
 let
 me
 know.
 I
 don't
 see
 anything.


It
 could
 just
 be
 Algo's
 after
 hours


being
 algorithmic.


I
 mean,
 Oracle,
 Salesforce
 are
 having
 a


conference.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 whatever


they're
 saying,
 I
 don't
 know,
 is
 enough


to
 move
 it.
 Um,
 again,
 the
 big
 the
 big


headline
 of
 the
 day
 outside
 of
 the


soybean
 stuff
 was
 Pal
 basically
 saying


QT
 is
 over.
 And


I
 mean,
 like,
 look,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 I
 know
 we
 talked
 this
 morning
 about


FOMO
 and
 kind
 of
 navigating
 it
 and
 how


you
 understand
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 all
 those


rules
 apply
 of
 um
 buying
 things
 that
 you


feel
 comfortable
 owning.
 But
 at
 its


core,
 if
 we're
 getting
 into
 quantitative


easing,


assets
 are
 moving
 higher.
 And
 so
 the


question
 becomes
 which
 ones
 do
 you
 want


to
 be
 positioned
 into
 while
 also


navigating
 you
 know
 your
 own
 mental


health
 of
 holding
 on
 to
 those
 positions


but
 being
 net
 long
 I
 think
 still
 becomes


the
 answer.
 So
 again,
 Pal
 signaled
 the


central
 bank
 may
 stop
 shrinking
 its


balance
 sheet,
 aka
 quantitative
 tending


in
 the
 coming
 months.
 An
 important
 shift


necessary
 to
 preserve
 liquidity
 in
 the


overnight
 funding
 markets,
 which
 would


mean
 more
 assets


likely
 get
 a
 pump.


But
 I
 still
 don't
 have
 a
 reason
 why
 we


have
 a
 spike
 on
 on
 the
 S&P
 after
 hours.


But
 you
 are
 green,
 so
 there
 you
 go.


Honey
 and
 tea,
 huh?
 Dude,
 I
 need
 I
 need


to
 start
 taking
 care
 of
 my
 voice
 as


well.
 I
 don't
 I
 really
 don't


>> Dude,
 I'm
 really
 You
 guys
 need
 to
 help


me
 out
 with
 the
 what
 tea
 to
 get
 here
 or


whatever.


>> Yeah,
 I
 need
 to
 start
 I
 need
 to
 start


taking
 care
 of
 myself.


>> And
 there's
 so
 much
 like
 sugar
 like


Okay.


>> In
 what?
 In
 tea.


>> Honey.


>> Oh,
 and
 honey.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And


honey.
 That's
 fair.


>> Dude,
 did
 you
 do
 your
 Halloween


decorations
 yet?


No,
 but
 my
 mom
 did.
 I
 walked
 into
 our


house.


>> My
 my
 pumpkin
 I
 carved.
 It's
 pretty


good,
 huh?


>> No,
 it's
 really
 good.


>> But
 when
 I
 when
 I
 came
 home,
 my
 like
 it


was
 like
 freaking
 Halloween.
 Yo,
 dude,


has
 anyone
 watched
 Halloween
 Town
 in
 the


chat?


>> Bro,
 that
 is
 the
 all-time
 greatest


Halloween
 movie
 of
 all
 time.


>> That
 and
 Hocus
 Pocus.
 Those
 two
 banger,


but
 Halloween
 Town's
 the
 best.


You
 are
 um


you
 are
 not
 30.


>> I'm
 basically
 30,
 bro.
 I'm
 28.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 about
 that.


>> Dude,
 in
 12
 years
 I'll
 be
 40.


>> No,
 you're
 way
 old
 for
 your
 you
 you
 uh


>> crazy.


>> You
 uh
 you
 don't
 have
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


older
 friends,
 huh?


You
 know,
 I've
 always
 gotten
 along
 with


older,
 even
 when
 I
 was
 younger,
 like


like
 our
 neighbors
 were
 much
 older,
 and


I
 I
 would
 have
 full-on
 conversations


with
 them
 every
 day.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 walking
 down


uh
 a
 couple
 hours
 ago,
 just
 like
 down


the
 block.
 I
 met
 one
 of
 my
 old
 neighbors


I
 haven't
 talked
 to
 in
 five
 years.


Apparently,
 he
 works
 in
 the
 area.


>> Yeah.
 Near
 the
 new
 place.
 And
 I
 And
 we


both
 looked
 at
 each
 other.
 We
 took
 a


second
 look
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Bro."
 And


he
 was
 like, "Bro."
 And
 so
 it's
 just
 so


crazy
 sometimes
 because
 we
 moved
 in
 2020


and
 I
 haven't
 seen
 him
 since
 because
 of


COVID
 everything.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 is
 crazy
 when
 you
 reconnect
 with


people.


>> Sauce
 man,
 buy
 everything,
 sell


everything.
 No,
 SMCI
 got
 so
 my
 my
 crew's


like,
 "Dude,
 what
 contracts
 do
 you
 have?


What
 what's
 your
 position?"
 I'm
 like,
 "I


just
 need
 to
 like
 consolidate
 here


because
 I
 was
 just
 like
 shotgunning


across
 the
 board.
 I
 think
 I'm
 going
 to


land
 on
 the
 20
 27s


and
 then
 I
 kind
 of
 move
 those
 to
 80s


leaps
 though.
 I
 like
 the
 leaps
 and
 the


the
 the
 the
 mini
 leaps.


>> Well,
 I'm
 with
 you.
 I'm
 in
 it.


>> We
 should
 have
 a
 pumpkin
 carving


contest.


>> Did
 you
 actually
 carve
 that
 or
 did
 you


buy
 that,


>> dude?
 Absolutely.
 Look
 at
 that.
 That
 is


hot.


>> Pick
 it
 up.
 Bring
 it
 next
 to
 Did
 you


actually
 carve
 That's
 a
 pretty


>> I
 That's
 a
 pretty
 good
 pumpkin
 carve.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 heavy.


>> When
 did
 you
 take
 the
 time
 to
 carve


that?
 When
 did
 you
 have
 the
 time
 to


actually?


>> I
 don't
 believe
 you
 carved
 that.
 I
 don't


believe
 you
 carve
 that,
 bro.
 I
 think
 you


bought
 that.


>> There's
 no
 way,
 bro.
 That's
 a
 precise


carved
 pumpkin.


There's
 no
 freaking
 way.


And
 you
 set
 up
 the
 lights
 with
 it.


That's
 definitely
 not.


>> You
 think
 it
 was
 graphics?


>> That's
 too
 good
 to
 be
 carved.
 Way
 too


good
 to
 be
 carved.


>> Also,
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 time
 to
 carve
 a


pump.
 You're
 a
 trading
 goal.
 There's
 no


way
 you
 sat
 down
 and
 had
 the
 patience
 to


carve
 up.
 There's
 no
 way.


>> I
 knew
 that
 I
 did
 it
 last
 night
 while
 we


were
 on
 our
 show.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 All
 right.


All
 right,
 folks.
 Let's
 get
 into
 rapid


fire.
 It'll
 be
 two
 minutes
 a
 ticker.
 Um,


and
 we'll
 try
 to
 get
 through
 as
 many.
 Is


there
 any
 is
 there
 anything
 that
 you


wanted
 to
 see
 that
 we
 didn't
 cover,
 sir?


>> Me
 personally,
 no.


>> Yeah,
 I
 usually
 do
 that.
 Evan
 joins
 my


Monday
 stream.
 He
 always
 gets
 his
 first


pick
 before
 we
 go
 into
 the
 audience


request.
 So,
 do
 you
 have
 a
 first
 pick?


>> No,
 I'm
 I
 I
 am
 a
 man
 of
 the
 people.


Whatever
 the
 people,


>> I
 am
 a
 man
 of
 the
 people.
 What
 do
 we
 do


for
 uh


We
 decided
 to
 do
 one
 minute
 30
 second.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 1:30.
 That's
 easier.
 130.


That's
 easier.


All
 right.
 So,
 just
 please
 be
 patient.


We
 will
 probably
 get
 through
 most
 of


them.


>> Are
 you
 picking
 them
 from
 the
 audience?


>> Yes,


>> you
 are.


Can
 I
 do
 a
 can
 I
 add
 one
 request?


>> Of
 course.


>> For
 context.


>> Of
 course.
 Um
 just
 when
 you
 guys
 send
 it


and
 then
 if
 you
 can
 emit
 if
 they
 can


send
 some
 kind
 of
 context
 in
 terms
 of


time
 frame
 like
 what
 their
 time
 horizon


is


>> and
 then
 if
 you
 can


>> like
 uh


you
 know
 ticker


same
 one
 line
 ticker


expected
 time
 horizon
 that
 I'm
 ticker-


trade
 ticker-invest
 that's
 it


>> what
 no
 ticker


time
 6
 to9
 months,
 ticker
 one
 to
 three


years,
 ticker
 one
 to
 two
 weeks
 kind
 of


thing.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 have
 a
 catalyst


that
 you
 know
 of
 just
 in
 blur
 it,


>> put
 in
 a
 couple
 words.
 Okay,
 cool.


>> Yeah,
 that
 would
 be
 super
 helpful.


>> Okay,
 let's
 start
 off.
 Core
 weave
 six
 to


12
 months.


>> Oh,
 see?
 Yeah,
 they're
 running
 with


this.
 They
 got
 that.
 See,
 look
 at
 that.


That's
 really
 good.


CR.


Is
 that
 helpful?
 Oh,
 man.
 Did
 we
 just


Did
 we
 just
 hit
 something
 here?


>> Might
 have
 hit
 something
 new.
 That's
 not


bad.


>> Oh,
 look.
 They
 They're
 They
 can
 run
 with


this.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 put
 that,
 we


won't
 I
 mean,
 I
 would
 prefer
 this.
 So,


core
 weave,
 how
 long?


>> 6
 to
 12
 months.


>> Six.
 So,
 this
 is
 what
 happens


immediately.
 I'm
 going
 to
 switch
 to
 a


weekly,
 maybe
 even.


So,
 because
 of
 that,
 that
 changes
 my


entire
 outlook
 on
 this
 whole
 thing.
 So,


um
 it's
 it's
 it's
 just
 saying
 it's
 a
 big


deal.
 So
 here
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 update.


Not
 sure
 what
 these
 are.


So
 that's
 one.


This
 is
 two.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 twice.


So
 I
 want
 to
 have
 a
 base.
 So
 we've
 hit


the
 bigger
 pullback
 on
 the
 weekly


already
 at
 123.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 good.


You
 can
 still
 get
 a
 a
 solid
 potential


pullback
 and
 hold.
 We've
 been
 looking
 at


this
 core
 situation
 from
 this
 from
 that


time
 horizon.
 It
 can
 still
 pull
 back,


but
 as
 long
 as
 it's
 holding
 over
 124,


you're
 actually
 still
 on
 this
 general


trajectory.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 ripe


and
 ready
 over
 150.
 The
 next
 spot
 you're


going
 to
 go
 into
 is
 this
 175
 area
 that's


going
 to
 kind
 of
 um
 that's
 going
 to
 be


that
 where
 the
 bears
 show
 up
 right
 here


where
 the
 last
 stronghold
 of
 the
 bears


give
 up.
 And
 at
 that
 point,
 you
 will
 get


here.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 do
 get
 through


then
 we
 can
 look
 at
 this
 entire


consolidation


in
 the
 same
 time
 frame
 of
 a
 potential.


You
 would
 basically
 look
 like
 this
 and


then
 you
 would
 look
 like
 a
 second
 move


consolidation.
 Stocks
 don't
 go
 sideways.


Sorry.
 Like
 this


over
 here
 into
 this
 kind
 of
 general


trajectory.
 6
 to
 12
 months.
 This
 is


screenshot
 it.
 That's
 what
 you're


looking
 for.
 Um,
 pullbacks
 can
 still
 be


in
 the
 123s,
 but
 first
 stop
 180s.
 That


happens
 once
 you
 crack
 their
 150.
 Next,


unhel


6
 to
 12.
 All right.
 This
 is
 this
 is


happily
 on
 its
 way.


So,
 holding
 this
 super
 high
 and
 tight


number.
 So,
 6
 to
 12
 months.
 I'm
 using
 a


weekly
 cal
 um
 weekly
 time
 frame.
 I'm


still
 have
 my
 SMA
 set
 to
 a
 daily
 time


frame
 though.
 Always
 locked
 on
 the


daily.
 holding
 the
 20-day
 simple


actually
 solid
 here.
 Um,
 this
 is
 this
 is


still
 consolidating.
 35251
 is
 kind
 of


like
 their
 break
 and
 push
 over.
 Our
 our


next
 level
 377
 that
 is
 was
 has
 been
 that


gap
 fill
 that
 we
 outlined
 last
 week.
 So,


if
 you
 were
 here
 for
 the
 last
 show,
 that


first
 target,
 boom,
 tagged
 it,
 377
 to


the
 penny.
 So,
 that's
 a
 day
 trading,
 you


know,
 some
 kind
 of
 weekly.
 Sorry,
 reset


weekly


tag.
 At
 this
 point,
 you
 expect
 that
 to


happen.
 Then
 you
 see
 some
 consolidation.


Then
 you
 want
 to
 see
 another
 follow


through
 here.
 Um,
 that
 takes
 you
 to
 424


in
 this
 box
 right
 here.
 Uh,
 I'll
 pull


this
 back
 just
 slightly


just
 so
 I
 can
 get
 a
 better
 view.
 Oops.


And
 I'm
 just
 speeding
 up
 a
 little
 bit


because
 you're
 really
 in
 that
 time
 frame


looking
 at
 this
 and
 that
 is
 going
 to


align
 me
 yep
 one
 more
 time
 to
 that
 421


area
 and
 if
 for
 whatever
 reason
 you
 can


get
 through
 421
 then
 and
 only
 then
 do


you
 think
 about
 465s


that
 is
 unh.


>> Okay.
 Love
 it.
 Uh
 Oscar
 6
 months.


>> This
 is
 coming
 down
 to
 AC
 like
 ACA


extensions
 and
 the
 government
 shutdown.


>> Yeah.


>> On
 days
 like
 today
 open
 up.


>> Huh?


>> We
 should
 have
 more
 information
 after


the
 shutdown
 basically.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 as
 it
 was,
 they
 were
 already


looking
 good.
 If
 the
 ACA,
 if
 the
 if
 the


extensions
 go
 through,
 fundamentally,


you
 could
 be
 looking
 at
 a
 30
 $35
 stock.


6
 to
 12
 months,
 you're
 still
 looking
 at


this
 giant
 thing
 here
 as
 the


consolidation.
 If
 I
 look
 at
 it
 on
 a


weekly,
 it's
 the
 same
 same
 thing.
 I'm


just
 using
 a
 smaller
 time
 frame
 in
 that


instance.
 This
 is
 the
 same
 chart
 as


before.
 30
 to
 35
 is
 actually
 right
 here.


31


same
 exact
 block.
 Um,
 for
 now,
 this
 is


steadily
 in
 this
 uptrend.
 So,
 last
 week


we
 said
 19s
 were
 support.
 Guess
 what


this
 tested?
 Bingo.
 Bango.
 Bongo.


One
 more
 time.
 W
 for
 TT.


There
 it
 is.
 If
 you
 caught
 it,
 congrats.


Um,
 this
 is
 actually
 sub9
 on
 Fridays.


Even
 this
 morning,
 I
 did.
 There
 it
 is.
 I


I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 tell
 you,
 but


that's
 that's
 the
 spot.
 There
 it
 was.


Um,
 hopefully
 this
 holds.
 That's
 ideal.


We
 draw
 this
 across.
 You
 can
 see
 it
 one


more
 time
 right
 here.
 That
 prior


resistance
 turn
 support,
 resistance,


support.
 One
 more
 time.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Uh,


and
 then
 you're
 looking
 for
 even
 on
 just


this
 basic
 ascension,
 this
 gets
 hot
 and


heavy
 over
 22
 and
 a
 quarter,
 22
 and
 3/4,


which
 gives
 me
 confluence
 on
 the


trajectory.
 Uh,
 23
 and
 3/4
 on
 the


trajectory
 to
 30.
 Good
 god,
 Oscar.
 Next


>> QBTS
 6
 months
 quantum.


>> Quantum
 six
 months.
 This
 can
 this
 can
 go


all
 over
 the
 place,
 but
 let's
 just
 stick


with
 the
 uh


what
 do
 you
 call
 this?
 this
 spectacles,


techicals,
 whatever.


6
 months.
 So,
 smaller
 smaller
 stock.
 I


need
 to
 use
 uh
 a
 different
 time
 frame


here
 because
 of
 the
 way
 this
 moves.


Six
 months


on
 this
 guy
 low
 float.
 This
 has


happened.
 Uh
 let
 me
 get
 one
 more


move
 here.
 This
 has
 happened.
 I
 mean,


every
 one
 of
 these
 has
 happened.


Um,


I
 don't
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to
 take


six
 months.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be


significantly
 less
 than
 6
 months.
 This


is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 like
 1
 to
 3
 months


in
 the
 $50
 range.


And
 then
 at
 that
 point,


you're
 looking
 at
 a


you're
 looking
 at
 this
 type
 of


trajectory.


And
 then
 you're
 looking
 at


So
 you're
 looking
 six
 months
 here,
 here,


here.
 So
 twofold.
 You're
 looking
 at


multi
 multiple
 waves.
 We
 call
 waves,
 but


multiple
 iterations
 6
 months
 down
 the


line.
 You
 don't
 need
 six
 months
 for
 this


to
 get
 to
 50.
 Um
 that
 would
 as
 long
 as


this
 stays
 the
 course,
 that's
 going to


happen
 way
 before
 six
 months.


Uh
 stop.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 this


below
 38.


That
 would
 be
 your
 that
 would
 be
 your


full-blown
 retest.
 But,
 uh,
 losing
 38


would
 mean
 that
 you
 do
 see
 35s
 and
 that


would
 be
 a
 deeper


pullback
 here.


Still
 somewhat
 on
 course
 though.
 All


right.
 Next,


>> Salesforce
 one
 year.


>> Um,
 one
 year.


I
 mean,
 these
 guys
 announced
 an
 OpenAI


partnership
 and
 still
 nothing
 today.


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 a
 year
 here


either.
 I
 would
 probably
 break
 it
 up.


One
 year
 is
 a
 heavy
 commitment
 on


Salesforce
 because
 it's
 at
 the
 spot


right
 now.
 Right
 here
 and
 now.


Um,
 so
 if
 it
 if
 if


this
 does
 turn
 around
 7
 or
 240
 has
 been


kind
 of
 like
 that
 general
 area.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 300
 is
 if
 this
 does
 turn


around,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 your
 next


general
 spot
 in
 here.
 Do
 we
 want
 to
 zoom


this
 in?
 So,
 I'm
 not
 on
 a
 weekly
 now


because
 we
 are
 at
 the
 like
 absolute


tippy
 top
 of
 this
 consolidation
 here.


It's
 been
 basing
 out.


It's
 not
 on
 October
 stocks.
 Tomorrow's


sale
 or
 Dreamforce
 I
 think
 they
 have
 a


they
 have
 a
 investor
 day
 slash
 keynote


at
 the
 same
 time
 tomorrow.
 This
 is
 a
 big


pivot.


Fundamentals
 are
 going
 to
 come
 into


effect
 tomorrow.
 Um,
 and
 so
 fundamentals


will
 change
 this
 this
 this
 stock
 story


tomorrow.
 I
 think
 two
 things
 can
 happen.


One,
 uh,
 if
 this
 trajectory
 is
 to


happen,
 you'll
 start
 to
 see
 this


actually
 begin
 to
 play
 like
 tomorrow
 and


that
 would
 be
 into
 260s
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 week.
 It
 could
 still
 go
 sideways


legitimately.
 And
 then
 um
 and
 then
 you'd


want
 to
 see
 this
 kind
 of
 continuation


within
 that
 same
 time
 frame.
 So
 within


that
 time
 frame
 here,
 but
 you
 still
 want


to
 see
 this
 entire
 area
 become
 that
 low


right
 over
 here.
 So
 it's
 still
 here
 and


now.
 If
 you
 lose
 that
 200
 week,
 then
 you


are
 looking
 at
 210.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 Zeta
 one
 year.


>> Zeta,
 is
 this
 helping
 everybody?
 Is
 this


helping
 me?
 I
 think
 this
 is
 helping
 a


lot
 more.
 Yeah,


>> this
 is
 helping
 me
 a
 lot


>> with
 the
 time
 frame.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 okay.
 So,


it's
 it's
 a
 kind
 of
 like


run-of-the-mill


area.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 This
 is
 not
 a


great
 pullback.
 It's
 just
 a
 okay


pullback.
 Great
 pullbacks
 in
 the
 16s.


That
 would
 complete


great
 pullback
 in
 the
 16s
 would
 complete


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 very
 bullish
 would


which
 would
 complete
 a
 very
 strong
 head


and
 shoulders.


If
 you
 were
 to
 get
 that


then
 you
 could
 look
 for
 this
 move
 into


the
 26s.


It's
 just
 okay
 here
 at
 18.


That's
 within
 that
 time
 frame.


this
 close
 to
 the
 200
 day
 simple


and
 you're
 looking
 at
 um


that
 would
 be
 a
 fill
 of
 this
 this
 low


volume
 pocket
 between
 11850
 which
 we


outlined
 last
 week.
 It
 is
 holding
 right


now.
 So
 it's
 a
 bullish
 hold.
 But
 if
 that


does
 fill
 then
 your
 your
 bigger
 discount


is
 around
 15
 and
 3/4
 just
 under
 16.
 Uh


but
 no
 reason
 to
 sell
 here
 with
 that


time
 frame
 without
 with
 that
 time


horizon.
 Just
 know
 that
 you
 don't
 want


to
 be
 fully
 positioned
 either
 because


you
 could
 get
 a
 you
 could
 get
 a
 a
 real


nice
 little
 discount,
 which
 is
 a


measured
 pullback
 into
 a
 golden
 pocket


retracement
 from
 this
 swing
 low
 to
 swing


high
 here,
 which
 aligns
 with
 this
 order


block
 right
 here.


>> Next,


>> bullish
 Jake,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


He
 says,
 "My
 dad
 is
 up
 82%
 on
 Regetti.


Needs
 help
 with
 putting
 up
 a
 stop-loss


in
 the
 next
 3
 to
 nine
 months."
 3
 to
 nine


months.
 Uh,
 no
 stop
 loss
 here.
 The
 only


thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 is
 uh
 is
 control


sizing.


So,
 stop
 losses
 are
 not
 going
 to
 help


you
 on
 a
 stock
 like
 Regetti.
 Um,


especially
 if
 you
 actually
 get
 stopped


out.
 I
 would
 suggest
 not
 doing
 that.
 Uh,


and
 just
 control
 your
 sizing
 of
 the


position
 as
 a
 whole.
 Um,
 too
 big,
 you


get
 too
 excited,
 too
 small,
 you
 don't


have
 enough.
 and
 and
 if
 you
 do
 get


stopped
 out
 then
 you
 you're
 prone
 to


FOMOing
 back
 in
 at
 the
 wrong
 time.
 So


stay
 but
 um
 size
 appropriately.
 You're


at
 the
 top
 of
 this
 channel
 here.
 So


again,
 do
 you
 sell?
 No.
 Is
 it
 going
 to


like
 fully
 come
 back
 like
 no?
 I
 think


this
 retest
 is
 at
 49s.
 Remember
 bottom


of
 the
 channel
 is
 your
 best
 trade


location
 as
 always.
 This
 is
 your


channel.


um
 you
 guys
 don't
 have
 it,
 you
 can


screenshot
 this
 here.
 But
 I
 would
 take


this
 general
 area
 right
 there.
 That's


going
 to
 put
 you
 right
 around
 here.
 If


this


is
 uh
 your
 Yeah,
 I
 have
 a
 measure
 move


that's
 completed
 here.
 And
 then
 if
 I


have
 a
 measured
 pullback,


I'm
 getting
 I'm
 getting
 the
 same


pullback
 to
 48.
 But
 this
 should
 this


should
 be
 a
 bit
 exhausted
 in
 the


meantime.
 and
 expect
 some
 going
 to
 pull


back
 from
 58
 from
 from
 today
 56s
 to


about
 49
 as
 standard.
 If
 you
 lose
 43


then
 you've
 lost
 lost
 trend
 to
 your


legitimate
 actual
 question.
 Losing
 trend


would
 look
 like
 this
 here
 which
 is
 below


44.


>> Okay.


Um,


another
 super
 chat.
 Unity.
 This
 one,
 no


time
 frame,
 just


>> I
 actually
 don't
 hate
 Unity.
 I
 still


like
 Unity.
 I
 actually
 started
 to
 get
 a


bit
 of
 a
 pump
 here.


It
 got
 hit
 right
 at
 the
 50-day
 simple.


Um,
 this
 is
 back
 to
 entry,
 if
 you
 will.


So,
 this
 is
 um
 Can
 I
 Can
 I
 not
 start


this
 for
 just
 a
 second?
 Yeah.


>> Just
 because
 it's
 a
 special
 it's

the
 it's
 the
 bony
 frill
 of
 what
 we
 call


the
 the
 triceratops.


This
 is
 a
 paper
 profit
 special


crazy.
 So,
 uh,
 so
 just
 know
 that's
 what


it
 is.
 This
 is
 the
 bony
 frill.
 It's
 the


it's
 the
 horn.
 It's
 the
 first
 bullish


sentiment.
 And
 then
 what
 you
 do
 is
 you


you
 ride
 the
 bony
 frill
 up,
 which
 takes


it
 to
 about
 45.
 But
 you're
 always
 very


cautious
 of
 the
 violent
 trajectory
 back


down
 because
 this
 is
 very
 real.
 also.


So,
 that's
 how
 that
 whole
 thing
 works.


It's
 very
 real.
 It's
 not
 uh
 it's
 not
 an


endangered
 species
 or
 pattern.
 It


actually
 plays
 out
 all
 the
 time.
 Um
 but


it's
 a
 bullish
 hold
 here.
 So,
 I
 still


like
 it.
 Uh
 I
 would
 not
 stop
 out
 of


this.
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 fundamental
 story


behind
 this.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 super


high
 conviction.
 Is
 a
 very
 good


technical
 spot.
 I
 do
 like
 the
 technical


spot.
 The
 technicals
 are
 not
 invalidated


until
 it's
 below
 3175.


Next,


>> PayPal
 one
 year.


>> Don't
 hate
 it
 at
 all.
 Um,
 I
 think
 you


could
 take
 some
 of
 these
 in
 chunks.


You're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 kind
 of


I
 mean,
 another
 little
 bony
 frill
 if
 you


were
 to
 see
 it.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 still
 toppy,
 right?
 So,
 earnings


are
 coming
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.
 So,


just
 know
 look,
 we
 got
 we
 got
 one
 um


pre-earnings
 move
 was
 into
 it,
 hit
 that


consolidation.
 You
 know,
 I
 wanted
 to


believe
 that
 it
 continues
 to
 go,
 but
 we


always
 say,
 hey,
 you
 know,
 the
 first


time
 that
 these
 things
 typically
 break


or
 break
 that
 that
 first
 downtrend,
 they


tend
 to
 be
 a
 short
 near-term
 short
 as
 in


short
 short
 term,
 which
 it
 did
 fail.


That's
 all
 that
 that
 means.
 And
 where


they
 fail
 too,
 they
 typically
 fail
 right


into
 that
 prior
 supply
 or
 that
 prior
 buy


zone
 which
 is
 exactly
 where
 this
 went
 um


last
 uh
 today
 and
 yesterday.
 And


actually
 this
 setup
 here
 I
 think
 is
 a


long
 here
 and
 now
 right
 into
 this
 in


this
 prior
 support
 area
 here.
 This


should
 set
 you
 up
 for
 the
 for
 another


shot
 at
 least
 into
 that
 same
 exact
 area.


You
 still
 need
 to
 be
 very
 cautious
 at


74.85.
 Um,
 I
 think
 this
 can
 set
 up
 for


another
 push
 into
 that
 200
 day.
 But
 that


200
 week
 simple
 moving
 average,
 which
 is


this
 purple
 line
 right
 here,
 remains


overhead
 resistance
 remains
 that
 you


have
 a
 fair
 value
 gap.
 This
 is
 a
 base


that's
 been
 established
 over
 a
 very
 long


period
 of
 time.
 If
 I
 pull
 this
 back,


it's
 it's
 a
 very
 important
 pivot.
 So


holding
 here
 is
 very
 good
 long
 term,
 but


to
 expect
 it
 to
 explode
 here
 and
 now
 um


you
 know
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 deterred
 based
 on


that
 time
 horizon
 um
 with
 that
 little


blip
 on
 this
 radar.
 You're
 looking
 for
 a


much
 longer
 continuation
 which
 is
 going


to
 blow
 past
 your
 earnings
 and
 over
 81


then
 you
 can
 start
 talking
 about
 90s
 and


then
 over
 90s
 fine
 we
 can
 talk
 about


this.
 At
 this
 point,
 once
 you
 get


through
 that,
 you've
 been
 beyond


earnings
 and
 you
 would
 need
 to
 have
 some


confirmation
 that
 the
 fundamentals
 of


this
 entire
 company
 have
 changed.
 So,


this
 will
 be
 a
 fundamental
 catalyst
 that


confirms

 very


possible.
 If
 that
 happens,
 you're


probably
 looking
 at
 a
 pullback
 into
 the


nines
 and
 then
 you
 would
 really
 uh
 what


what
 Nick
 might
 be
 like,
 you
 know,


praying
 for
 way
 later
 is
 in
 the
 1350s.


uh
 which
 you
 never
 know.
 It's
 probably


probably
 not
 going
 to
 get
 there.
 I
 would


say
 realistically
 somewhere
 in
 the


1240s,


but
 very
 cautious
 at
 that
 point
 that
 you


have
 some
 kind
 of
 major
 overhead


resistance.


That
 would
 be
 a
 beautiful
 trade.
 Uh
 but


without
 having
 to,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't


know.
 A
 hasn't
 said
 that
 he's
 going
 to


Teddoc
 yet
 over
 the
 HIMS
 or
 other
 um


other
 places.
 By
 the
 way,
 Costco
 is


selling
 the
 Olympic
 now.
 I
 heard


>> really


>> I
 did
 hear
 that.


>> Next


>> Clean
 Spark
 in
 general.
 This
 another


>> miners
 in
 general.
 I
 think
 they
 got
 they


got
 a
 lifeline,
 right?
 Um
 I
 think


someone
 said
 that
 Clean
 Spark
 because
 I


did
 mention
 like,
 oh,
 these
 miners
 are


going
 to
 dilute
 later.
 I
 think
 Clean


Bark
 said
 that
 Clean
 Bark
 Clean
 Spark


said
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 dilute
 and


maybe
 this
 is
 the
 lifeline
 that
 they


that
 the
 whole
 cohort
 needed.


Um
 but
 this
 is
 right
 through
 that
 more


recent
 kind
 of
 area.
 So
 this
 has
 broken


through.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 this


lifeline


is
 at
 least
 from
 a
 market
 perspective


being
 seen
 in
 fact
 as
 a
 lifeline.
 So
 at


this
 point,


God,
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 me
 do
 it,


aren't
 they?
 We're
 going
 to
 the
 way
 back


machine.
 2845
 way
 back
 machine
 here.


Let's
 call
 this
 a
 session
 gap
 with
 a


breakdown.
 2861.
 Good
 night.
 Fine.
 Fine.


Fine.
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 go
 that
 far,
 but


you're
 twisting
 my
 arm
 because
 we
 are
 if


if
 we
 do
 get
 through
 this
 is
 your
 fair


value.
 21.
 Boom.
 We're
 there.
 So,
 expect


this
 one.
 So,
 you're
 here.
 So,
 let's
 say


1
 2
 3.
 If
 we
 get
 a
 chop
 chop
 chop
 pull


back
 bigger
 on
 the
 fourth
 attempt
 fine


2861


there
 you
 have
 it.
 Clean
 spark
 which


means
 that
 this
 general
 area
 of
 whatever


that
 happens
 to
 be
 18
 is
 a
 pullback


zone.
 It's
 a
 minor.
 There's
 a
 big
 shift.


There's
 a
 sentiment.
 So
 sentiment
 here


matters.
 Sentiment
 has
 changed
 for
 the


miners
 as
 a
 whole.
 Does
 it
 need
 to
 pull


back?
 No,
 it
 doesn't
 need
 to
 pull
 back.


It
 can
 just
 do
 this.


All
 right.


>> Okay.
 By
 the
 way,
 we
 have
 some
 news


right
 here.
 Bent
 and
 Greer
 are
 going
 to


hold
 a
 press
 conference
 on
 the
 economy.


I
 think
 if
 that
 happens
 tomorrow,
 then


we'll
 see
 what
 they
 both
 have
 to
 say.


Uh,
 Applied
 Digital
 next
 three
 months.


>> APLD.
 I
 think
 this
 has
 gotten
 um
 it's


gotten
 some
 more
 attention.
 Um,
 there's


clearly
 a
 story
 here,


but
 okay.
 Now,


this
 has
 actually
 hit
 through
 um
 a


pretty
 heavy
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 congrats.


I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 sell
 this.
 Um


so,
 so
 this
 has
 gotten
 through
 a
 pretty


heavy


um
 area.
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 sell


this.
 And
 um
 and
 I
 don't
 hate
 this


either.
 So
 this
 whole
 thing
 is
 I
 think


what
 people
 were
 maybe
 trying
 to
 like


yell
 at
 us
 about
 which
 I
 wasn't
 really


seeing


near
 term.
 This
 is
 what
 we're
 looking


at.
 So
 without
 going
 really
 deep
 in
 the


weeds
 on
 the
 far
 far
 left,
 let's
 just
 go


ahead
 and
 look
 at
 this
 here
 now
 and
 say


if
 this
 is
 in
 fact
 the
 consolidation
 and


breakthrough,
 we'll
 give
 it
 the
 benefit


of
 the
 doubt.
 50s.


Um


the
 uh
 [ __ ]
 me


say
 that
 out
 loud.
 It's
 50s,
 dude.
 Um
 so


sentiment
 sentiment


>> lowat.
 It's
 a
 low
 float.
 I
 could
 get


that.


>> It's
 50s.
 It's
 what
 it
 is.
 Um


it's
 50s
 and
 that
 means
 that
 in
 the
 in


the
 meantime,


the
 pullbacks,
 but
 this
 is
 it's
 now
 got


enough
 that
 I
 can
 actually
 tinker
 with


this
 um
 31s.


Now
 it's
 acting
 proper
 like
 all
 right
 so


31s


would
 be
 3189
 cool


this
 is
 like
 a
 pullback
 here


and
 that
 would
 put
 your
 as
 an
 extension


on
 the
 way


here.
 Oops


here.
 And
 then
 one
 more


sorry
 pullback


here.


And
 that's
 how
 you
 get
 there.
 One,
 two,


three.
 Multi
 multi
 leg.
 So
 one,
 two,


three,
 four.


>> Okay.


Um,
 Hercules
 Jack,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 We
 did
 Regetti,
 but
 Jason,
 any


thoughts
 on
 a
 target
 or
 you
 think
 this


thing
 is
 just
 exploding?


>> Oh,
 upside
 target.
 I
 think
 I
 did
 do
 both


of
 that
 cuz
 cuz
 the


So
 that
 the
 question
 was
 for
 a
 stop


loss.
 The
 target
 here
 is
 just
 to
 be
 in


this
 channel
 and
 if
 this
 pullback,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 in
 65
 65
 to
 68s.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 actually
 going
 to
 break
 down.


I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 your
 pullback
 area.


here
 and
 this
 continues
 on
 into
 that
 65


areas.


>> Cool.
 Uh,
 Big
 Bear
 one
 year.


>> Oh,
 I'm
 I'm
 surprised
 we
 haven't
 gotten


hit
 with
 Sound
 yet.
 Um,


>> we
 got
 that
 one,
 too.
 We'll
 do
 that.


>> We
 did.


>> I
 mean,
 we'll
 do
 it
 after
 this.


>> Okay.
 So,
 heavy
 consolidation
 finally


breaking
 out.
 Um,
 one
 year
 BBAI


weekly,
 right?
 So,
 one,


okay,
 one,
 two.
 Does
 it
 need
 to
 happen


now?
 No.
 Uh,
 I
 like
 that
 750


as
 a
 pullback
 on
 a
 headline.
 Uh,
 I'm


assuming
 that
 just
 by
 eyeing
 this
 chart,


that
 actually
 looks
 like
 I
 might
 be
 spot


on
 on
 that
 750.
 Um,


I
 was
 really
 close.
 Seven.
 So,
 a
 a


really
 nice
 pullback
 would
 be
 in
 the


sevens.


And
 that
 would
 actually
 set
 you
 up
 for


for
 that
 followth
 through.
 And
 the


follow
 through
 would
 look
 like


right
 off
 the
 50-day.


Well,
 okay.
 Into
 11
 and
 change.


I'm
 not
 usually
 super
 bullish
 like
 this,


but
 this
 is
 I
 take
 this
 as
 bullish
 or


bearish
 because
 it's
 like
 you're
 you're


at
 nine
 something
 and
 I'm
 telling
 you


that's
 a
 that's
 a
 heavy
 retracement,
 but


it's
 a
 heavy
 retracement
 to
 go
 shopping.


It's
 a
 30%
 pull
 down
 draw
 down
 to
 go


shopping
 for
 a
 bigger
 move
 that
 I
 think


is
 going
 to
 Yep.
 going
 to
 line
 up
 with


this.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 can
 fully
 go


into
 this
 whole
 situation
 right
 now,
 but


what
 we
 can
 do
 Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 going
 to


line
 me
 up
 also.
 So
 um
 right
 here
 835


is
 that
 from
 swing
 high
 swing
 low
 that


50%
 retracement


getting
 a
 push
 through
 835


landing
 this
 into
 1060
 is
 exactly
 that


bearish
 um
 that
 bearish
 retracement
 on


that.
 Right.


Next.


>> Um,
 let's
 do


this
 one
 right
 here.
 Lemonade
 one
 year.


>> Lemonade
 one
 year.
 Are
 you guys
 good


with
 this
 flow?
 Is
 this
 helping?
 No,


>> I
 think
 it's
 really
 good.
 It's
 really


good.


>> I
 think
 we're
 burning
 through
 these,


too.
 So,
 this
 is
 actually
 a
 monthly


multi
 multimon.
 So,
 two
 month
 two
 almost


three
 month
 consolidation
 that
 should
 be


ready
 soon.
 um
 insurance
 healthcare


helping.
 It's
 right
 in
 that
 golden
 kind


of
 retracement
 from
 this
 35.


Yeah,
 that's
 50%
 retracement.
 Can
 it


come
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 more?
 Sure.
 That


little
 bit
 more
 looks
 like
 45.
 Does
 it


have
 to?
 No,
 it
 doesn't.
 Um
 I
 would


actually
 like
 to
 see


this
 is
 Spencer.


Spencer
 asking
 for
 this.


>> No,
 just
 someone
 else.


>> No.


70.


Um,


>> this
 one's
 been
 Yeah,
 as
 you
 said,
 it's


consolidated
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


now.


>> Almost
 three
 months.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Two
 over
 two
 months.
 So,
 70.
 I


have
 some
 I
 have
 some
 confluence
 here.


I
 mean,


we're


Yeah,
 I
 just
 If
 I
 just
 go
 here
 to
 here,


I
 confluence
 again.


Yeah,
 I
 have
 multiple
 levels
 of


confluence


and


yeah.


Um,


yes,


it
 can
 come
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 more.


Um,


but
 it's
 not
 a
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 short
 this.


Looks
 like
 it
 did
 that
 on
 Friday.
 You


might
 have
 missed
 it.
 It
 might
 have


happened
 already.
 That
 was
 a
 that
 it
 hit


on
 Friday.
 [ __ ]
 Shoot.
 Sorry,
 my


language.
 Um,
 dang.
 It
 might
 have


happened.
 So,
 this
 might
 be
 ready
 to


roll.
 Healthcare
 is
 uh
 is
 rotating.
 So,


all right.
 Put
 it
 on
 the
 watch.


>> Fine.


>> They
 have
 earnings
 coming.
 So,


>> Adobe
 one
 year.


>> 100.


Is
 there
 a
 Z
 put?


a
 zero
 view
 that
 bearish.
 Goodness.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 I
 This
 is
 not
 um


um


they
 need
 a
 fundamental
 shift.
 So,


sentiment
 wise,
 it's
 bad.
 It's
 worse


than
 CRM.
 Way
 worse
 than
 CRM.


Uh
 yikes.


It
 is.


>> I
 don't
 think
 AI
 kills
 these
 guys,
 but


it
 doesn't
 make
 them
 more
 exciting


either.


>> No,
 but
 they
 have
 Figma.
 Don't
 we
 have


Canva
 coming
 soon?


>> Yeah.


>> Those
 two
 things
 are
 what
 I'm
 talking


about.
 Those
 two
 specific
 IPOs
 are
 like


kind
 of
 gonna
 crush
 this
 um
 sentiment,


not
 in
 reality.


So,
 I
 would
 say
 if
 you're
 long,
 stay
 the


course.
 If
 you're
 not
 long,
 you
 you
 can


wait
 patiently


below
 275.


below
 275.
 You
 can
 you
 can
 you
 got


plenty
 of
 time
 here.
 You're
 not
 going
 to


know
 that
 this
 is
 out
 of
 the
 weeds
 until


your
 see
 how
 tight
 CRM
 was.


This
 one's
 not
 really
 even
 like
 kind
 of


close
 to
 that
 that
 level
 of
 tightness.


It's
 more
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 bust
 through


this
 last
 level
 one
 more
 time
 and
 take


another
 leg
 to
 the
 downside


in
 here.
 But
 earnings
 are
 coming.


Um,
 the
 only
 way
 this
 this
 invalidates


is
 if
 this
 does
 break
 through,
 which
 is


possible.
 Um,
 and
 I
 would
 have
 to
 zoom


in
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 But
 again,
 you


have
 a
 ways
 to
 go
 yet.
 It's
 it's
 closer


to
 falling
 out
 of
 the
 having
 the
 bottom


fall
 out
 than
 breaking
 through
 the
 top.


Right
 now,
 it's
 testing
 one,
 two,
 three,


four
 times
 going
 to
 test
 through
 that


330
 level.
 Um,


that'd
 be
 another
 $50


downside
 shot.


>> Okay.


>> They
 need
 a
 new
 storyline.
 They
 need
 a


sentiment
 change.


>> RR
 3
 months.


>> RR.


>> It's
 Rich
 Tech
 Robotics.


>> Oh,
 we
 must
 have
 done
 this
 last
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 had
 a
 pullback.


Look
 it.
 We
 had
 a
 pullback
 zone


that
 was
 522


from
 this
 last
 area.


What
 is
 this
 from?
 Oh,
 from
 actually
 I


had
 measured
 it
 here,
 but
 there
 it
 was.


That
 was
 from
 our
 last
 show.


Um,
 and
 so


let's
 say
 this
 does
 hold


where
 it's
 going
 to
 break
 through
 is


over
 seven.
 And
 in
 that
 instance,
 then


you
 have
 two
 levels.
 You're
 kind
 of


going
 to
 into
 this
 box
 right
 here.


Oops.


For
 that
 breakthrough,
 but
 that
 that


happens
 over


over
 like
 this
 general
 area
 which
 you're


still
 technically
 fighting
 with.
 It
 has


not
 broken
 through
 yet.
 So
 can
 it's


possible
 that
 this
 continues
 and
 and
 it


goes
 sideways
 and
 you
 still
 get
 this


like
 all
 of
 that's
 actually
 still


possible
 by
 the
 way.
 Um
 but
 so
 whether


or
 not
 it's
 here
 now
 or
 or
 this
 comes


down
 and
 and
 slowly
 goes
 back
 up,
 either


one
 of
 these
 two
 paths
 are
 possible.
 Um,


this
 is
 a
 tough
 one
 because
 it's
 at


resistance
 literally
 right
 now.


That's
 all
 I
 would
 say
 about
 this,
 but


it
 looks
 constructive.
 You
 just
 that
 was


the
 that
 was
 the
 pullback
 right
 here


that
 you
 didn't
 want
 to
 see
 it
 like
 that


was
 your
 best
 near-term
 within
 that
 time


horizon
 risk
 reward.
 Otherwise,
 from


here,
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 um


five,
 you
 still
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 that


515
 get
 lost.
 then
 that
 trade
 is
 uh


invalidated.


That's
 a
 trade
 trade.
 All right,
 next.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 before
 we
 do
 the
 next
 one,
 real


quick
 again
 guys,
 Jason's
 Twitter,
 I'm


putting
 it
 in
 the
 chat.
 If
 you
 want
 to


connect
 with
 him
 in
 his
 Discord,
 his


private
 links,
 you
 can
 click
 on
 that
 in


the
 description
 and
 you
 can
 get
 to
 know


more
 about
 him.
 And
 then
 in
 general,
 I


would
 follow
 him
 on
 Twitter
 because
 he


drops
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 charts
 that


are
 very
 useful
 to
 see
 in
 real
 time.


>> Um


>> have
 you
 have
 you
 seen
 this
 chart


though?
 Like
 what
 the
 hell?


>> It
 looks
 like
 a
 quantum
 nuclear
 AI.


>> It
 looks
 like
 a
 quantum
 leap
 to
 me.
 This


is
 so
 irritating.
 $359,


bro.


>> So
 irritating.


>> If
 you
 have
 rare
 earths
 or
 quantum
 or


nuclear
 in
 your
 name,
 you're
 going


>> is
 clean
 energy.
 Like
 uh
 yeah,


they
 must
 have
 gotten
 some
 news.


Has
 nobody
 seen
 the
 like
 seen
 this?
 Am
 I


the
 only
 one
 that
 knows
 that
 this
 stock


is
 a
 stock?


>> I
 did
 not
 know
 this
 existed,
 but
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 like
 this.
 I
 feel
 like


moving.


Um
 Matt
 says,
 "I
 sold
 it
 for
 a
 loss
 in


February."
 Damn.


>> Yeah,
 look
 at
 this
 thing.
 That's


disgusting.


>> Uh
 Weeble
 six
 months
 out.


lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 chatter
 that
 this
 thing


is
 going
 to
 20
 by
 end
 of
 year
 by
 some
 of


the
 TA
 people
 on
 X.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you


would
 agree
 with
 that
 or
 not.


>> I
 mean,
 who
 are
 we
 talking
 about?


>> Jake.
 Jake.
 That
 guy
 has
 [ __ ]
 like


>> with
 Jastic.


>> Yeah,
 he
 has
 thousands.


>> I
 know
 Jake.
 Look,
 I
 know
 him,
 though.


>> He's
 not
 He's
 not
 bad.
 He
 hits
 more
 than


he
 misses.


>> I
 Dude,
 I've
 done
 I've
 done
 classes
 with


Jake.
 Like,
 like
 side
 by
 side.


>> 20
 by
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Jake
 is
 do
 Jake
 is
 Woff
 he's
 very
 old


school
 so
 he's
 looking
 at
 this
 as
 a


large
 WOFF
 um
 pullback
 retest
 so
 um
 what


what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 this
 here
 and


now
 has
 to
 hold
 so
 Jake
 will
 also
 know


that
 this


must
 actually
 this
 is
 pretty
 much


exactly


Um


here
 the
 thing
 about
 this
 timing


critical.


So
 right
 here
 is
 what
 we
 call
 fair
 value


a
 different
 kind
 of
 fair
 value


11:02.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 that
 hit
 well
 it


said
 10
 or
 11.
 You
 got
 the
 downside


target.
 So
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 that


meta.
 So
 downside
 target
 acquired
 um


right
 into
 the
 supply.
 This
 is
 like
 um


yeah
 so
 this
 is
 a
 spot
 where
 you
 buy


there's
 no
 question
 here
 and
 this
 is
 not


a
 spot
 where
 you
 expect
 it
 to
 explode


either
 so
 you
 you
 accumulate
 in
 this
 you


in
 that
 time
 frame
 what
 was
 it
 well


anyways
 I
 know
 Jake
 this
 time
 frame
 you


you
 you
 expect
 another
 similar


uh
 30-day
 consult
 consolidation
 right


here
 and
 then


you're
 looking
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 move
 to


the
 upside.


Telling
 paper
 what's
 up.


>> But
 but
 but
 you
 think
 do
 you
 think
 it


can
 hit
 20
 end
 of
 year?


>> Well,
 Jake
 is
 doing
 the
 same
 thing
 that


I'm
 doing
 it.
 But
 he's
 going
 to
 be


basically
 that's
 basically
 what
 he's


saying
 is
 he's
 saying
 this.
 Um,
 so


the
 only
 difference
 here
 is
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 going
 level
 to
 level.
 Um,


I
 don't
 think
 that
 it
 supports
 the
 story


fundamentally,
 but
 I'll
 tell
 you
 how
 to


track
 it,
 which
 is
 what
 he
 won't
 do.
 Um,


cuz
 I
 would
 actually
 be
 I'll
 I'll
 go
 out


and
 limit
 and
 say
 I'll
 be
 better
 at
 that


than
 tracking
 tracking
 the
 trajectory


and
 pathing.
 So
 you
 you
 can
 So
 we're


going
 to
 go
 over
 time
 on
 this,
 but
 so


you
 can
 afford
 a
 30
 to
 45day
 base
 here.


Well,
 this
 goes
 sideways
 to
 sloppy


choppy.
 Um
 and
 then
 and
 then
 here
 we


just
 did
 exactly
 what
 exactly
 the


exercise
 that
 we've
 been
 doing.
 If
 if


and
 when
 you
 get
 through
 this
 level


here,
 we're
 going
 to
 call
 this
 a
 break


of
 structure,
 right?
 This
 1160
 is
 going


to
 be
 your
 change
 of
 character
 because


that's
 the
 top
 of
 this
 channel
 here.
 So,


your
 consolidation
 area
 legitimately,


you
 want
 it
 here.


Um,


this
 give
 me
 a
 second
 uh
 second
 here.


So


if
 this
 gets
 through


this
 area,
 so
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 looking


for
 another
 WO
 off
 setup
 in
 here,


another
 reaccumulation


of
 30
 to
 45
 days
 reaccumulation
 in


there.
 And
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 be


looking
 at
 a
 trajectory
 into
 1444.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 your
 50%
 pullback


from
 swing
 high
 to
 from
 this
 more
 more


recent
 swing
 high
 to
 that
 more
 recent


swing
 low.
 Swing
 high
 to
 this
 swing
 low.


that's
 here
 which
 is
 what
 we've
 this
 is


the
 exercise
 that
 we've
 been
 talking


about.
 I
 would
 I
 would
 absolutely
 expect


this
 longer
 consolidation
 and
 then
 from


here
 to
 here


so
 that
 you're
 tracking
 your
 pathing


from
 here
 to
 here.
 Cool.
 And
 then
 you


would
 want
 to
 see
 some
 kind
 of
 move.


You're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 fair
 value


here.
 This
 is
 how
 it
 always
 goes.
 Um,


but
 once
 you
 once
 you
 learn
 this
 kind
 of


schematic,
 if
 you
 will,


it's
 a
 blueprint
 for
 the
 stock
 market.


At
 that
 point,
 you
 can
 actually
 have


some
 kind
 of
 a
 retracement.
 You
 have


another
 30
 to
 45day
 consolidation
 and


then
 you
 do
 it
 again.


That's
 how
 you
 get
 there


or
 maybe
 longer
 consolidation.


This
 can
 happen
 here.
 This
 can
 happen


there.
 This
 does
 not
 have
 to
 happen


here,
 right?
 This
 can
 happen
 here.
 Then


you
 get
 this


and
 then
 and
 then
 you
 can
 get
 this


again.
 So
 this
 can
 be
 multifaceted


to
 be
 fair


waves
 like
 that.
 But
 that
 is
 how
 you


would
 get
 there
 more
 or
 less.
 But
 this


is
 the
 pathing.
 This
 is
 the
 tra


trajectory.
 It's
 not
 a
 one
 and
 done.


This
 is
 a
 This
 is
 a
 That's
 a
 That's
 an


investment
 is
 what
 that
 is.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 ASML
 next
 few
 months.


>> This
 one
 has
 earnings
 this
 week
 as
 well.


>> No,
 this
 one
 has
 earnings
 tomorrow.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Tomorrow.
 Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 can't
 do
 this
 one
 really


because
 you'll
 have
 to
 see
 what
 happens


tomorrow.


>> Yeah,
 actually
 that
 that
 makes
 sense.


We'll
 skip
 this
 because
 you're
 not
 going


to
 see
 it.
 Um,
 let's
 do
 four.
 6
 months.


F
 O
 U
 R
 four.


Oh,
 what
 happened?


>> Call
 Jonah.
 Get
 him
 on
 the
 phone
 right


now.


>> Is
 he
 still
 long
 this
 thing?


>> I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Um,


did
 I
 reset
 this?


>> Yeah,
 you're
 good.


>> The
 only
 headline
 is
 guys
 might
 work
 for


NASA
 again.


>> Oh,
 it
 leave.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 there
 was
 some
 talks
 that


he's


>> redising.


Look,
 trade
 location.


>> Oh,
 that's
 clean.


>> There's
 not
 really
 much
 more
 to
 say
 than


put
 that
 on
 an
 image
 like,
 "All
 right,


well,
 oh,
 sorry,
 daily.
 It
 can
 come
 in."


No,
 I
 mean,
 I
 mean,


that's
 trade
 location.
 If
 it
 breaks


down,
 it
 breaks
 down.
 It's
 no
 bueno.
 But


you
 have
 a
 higher,


a
 lower
 high.


This
 doesn't
 look
 bad.
 I
 mean,
 if
 the


trade
 look,
 if
 this
 fails,


then
 what
 you're
 looking
 at
 is
 a
 failure


into
 the
 60s.


This
 is
 investment.
 What
 What
 was
 the


time
 frame?


Um,
 six
 months,


>> uh,
 take
 the
 shot
 with
 a
 very
 tight


stop-loss.
 Uh,
 or
 if
 or
 flip
 it
 because


you're
 right
 on
 the
 edge.
 6
 months,
 you


can
 take
 the
 shot
 here.
 Now,
 if
 you
 lose


um


73,
 flip
 on
 that
 and
 go
 short
 to
 63.


Okay.


Um,
 Reddit
 one
 year


it's
 coming
 in.
 It's
 getting
 more


interesting.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 sellers


are
 getting


uh
 less
 and
 less.
 So,
 this
 is
 um


191.


Well,
 assuming
 that
 you
 already
 whole


owned
 it,
 I
 think
 that
 you're
 you're


mostly
 done.
 I
 think
 you
 could
 see
 190


and
 then
 if
 you
 have
 some
 covered
 calls,


buy
 those
 back.
 Um,
 we're
 getting
 to


uh
 earnings
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.


This
 is
 I
 think
 this
 sets
 up
 for
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 liquidity
 grab
 like
 this


and
 then
 some
 more
 chop
 and
 you
 get


this.
 So
 depending
 on
 where
 your
 cover


calls
 are,
 I
 guess
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 buy


those
 back,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 get
 this


kind
 of
 consolidation


in
 into
 earnings.
 So
 maybe
 that
 was
 a


you
 get
 this


right
 that
 like
 that
 and
 then
 right
 here


is
 where
 earnings
 would
 show
 up.


So
 I'm
 looking
 at
 191


dip.


>> Okay.
 path
 six
 months


>> dip
 and
 then
 pre-
 earnings
 rip


path
 six
 months
 path.


>> This
 one
 kind
 of
 really
 worked
 out
 past


>> I
 gotta
 say
 guys
 it
 sounds
 like
 it's


really
 easy
 for
 them
 to
 for
 for
 for
 you


to
 put
 this
 time
 horizon
 and
 it
 does
 it


does
 uh
 it
 changes
 everything
 for
 me
 so


>> I
 think
 it
 helps
 you
 a
 lot
 too.
 Um,
 so,


okay.
 So,
 it
 last
 week
 I
 said
 this
 was


actually
 at
 resistance.
 So,
 it
 was
 a


hard
 call
 for
 me.
 If
 if
 you
 took
 it,
 it


broke
 through
 the
 resistance
 and
 it
 got


to
 that
 upside
 target.
 So,
 congrats.


Somebody
 pinged
 me
 on
 X
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I


looked
 at
 it
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "Wow."
 Okay.


So,
 at
 resistance,
 but
 it
 did
 break


through.
 Boom.
 This
 is
 target
 acquired.


Um
 I
 think
 what
 you
 do
 what
 you
 do
 is


you
 kind
 of
 know
 for
 sure
 that
 like
 that


was
 your
 upside
 target
 1808.


Um


at
 this
 point
 you
 just
 where
 is
 my


pullback
 in
 your
 really


this
 is
 a
 pullback
 but
 it's
 a
 very
 light


pullback.
 I
 would
 expect
 some
 kind
 of


sideways
 price
 action
 over
 1696.
 That's


actually
 going
 to
 be
 200
 the
 200
 week


SMA,
 which
 is
 this
 purple
 line
 here
 on


my
 chart.
 200
 week
 SMA.
 Can
 they
 see


that?
 You
 can
 see
 that.
 That's
 fine.


That's
 good.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 daily.
 This


is
 actually
 a
 weekly
 200
 week
 time


frame.
 Um,
 it's
 different.
 It's


significant,
 but
 I
 would
 expect
 some


kind
 of
 consolidation
 and
 then


breakthrough
 happens
 over
 17
 for
 the


next
 one.
 Sorry,
 let
 me
 move
 forward.


Over
 17
 for
 the
 next
 one.


really.


Uh,
 which
 would
 be
 in
 the
 20s.


I'm
 I'm
 getting
 a
 new
 mouse.
 Someone


bought
 me
 a
 mouse
 and
 having
 it


delivered.
 I'm
 very
 appreciative
 because


this
 mouse
 is
 extremely
 noisy
 and
 I
 I'm


over
 it.
 U
 which
 lines
 me
 up
 to
 this


little
 area
 here.
 I
 would
 probably


undercut
 that
 $20
 level
 just
 slightly.


Yeah,
 I
 pro
 it's
 going
 to
 it's
 going
 to


if
 if
 it
 continues
 if
 you
 get


continuation
 I
 think
 you
 get
 a
 a


consolidation
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 and
 it's


going
 to
 try
 for
 20


crazy
 and
 if
 it
 fails
 though
 if
 it
 fails


below
 16
 then
 it
 goes
 all
 the
 way
 back


to
 13


or
 maybe


thereabouts.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 rub
 rubric
 one
 year


>> rubric


14
 15
 then
 13.


So
 this
 was
 this
 was
 the
 spot
 I'm
 like


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 torn
 on
 rubric.
 I
 love
 the


company.
 Do
 I
 like
 the
 stock?
 It's
 a


valuation
 thing
 and
 it's
 a
 TAM
 thing
 is


security
 but
 it's
 it's
 data
 protection.


It's
 a
 different
 flavor
 of
 security.
 Um


uh
 so


this
 broadening
 formation
 to
 an
 extent


um
 is
 what
 I
 actually
 didn't
 catch


earlier
 but
 it
 it
 actually
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a


broadening
 formation.
 So
 the
 lows
 here
 I


was
 I
 if
 if
 you
 see
 70


on
 another
 200
 day
 simple
 moving
 average


flush
 I
 think
 that's
 good.
 But
 but
 here


after
 holding


so
 swing
 low
 to
 swing
 high


of
 this
 one
 and
 I
 have
 some
 confirmation


here
 after
 tagging
 the
 bottom
 of
 this


broadening
 area
 and
 bouncing


I
 actually
 sorry
 I
 didn't
 I
 actually


I
 think
 you
 might


I
 think
 you
 might
 be
 able
 to
 take
 a
 shot


at
 it


um


was
 a
 very
 cautious
 shot
 cuz
 if
 it


doesn't
 go
 if
 it
 loses
 77
 and
 a
 half


then
 you
 do
 have


what
 was
 the
 time
 frame
 a
 year
 uh
 yeah


so
 like
 you
 could
 have
 position
 it's
 not


a
 short
 but
 you
 could
 see
 something
 just


below
 70
 just
 below
 as
 close
 to
 70
 as


you
 can
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 good
 I
 think


that
 that's
 more
 interesting
 to


um
 in
 the
 near
 term
 and
 then
 uh
 ideally


picking
 up
 around
 there.
 But
 I
 just
 you


got
 to
 be
 cautious
 because
 this
 is
 still


uh
 you
 you
 have
 this
 where
 where
 it
 hit


its
 head
 right
 here.
 This
 is
 that
 major


consolidation.
 So
 this
 was
 an
 an


investor
 base
 that
 was
 trying
 to
 attempt


to


be
 like
 an
 investor
 base
 that
 was
 trying


to
 be
 established.
 It
 bounced
 up.
 It
 hit


the
 head.
 It
 hit
 its
 head
 right
 here
 and


they
 sold
 right
 into
 it.
 So,
 that's
 a


that's
 a
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 rough
 sign.


All right.
 That's
 strictly
 on
 valuation.


I
 think


>> rocking.


>> Hopefully,
 this
 consolidates.
 I
 love
 the


stock.
 I
 love
 the
 company
 though
 and


tries
 again.
 Maybe
 you
 get


four
 attempts.


Rocket
 Mortgage.
 Oh,
 dude.
 I
 should
 have


looked
 at
 this
 today.
 I
 didn't
 look
 at


this.
 I'm
 so
 upset.
 Don't
 Don't
 be


green.
 Don't
 be
 green.
 Don't
 be
 green.


Don't
 be
 a
 big
 green
 stick.
 Okay.
 Okay.


It's
 manageable.


>> It's
 manageable.


>> This
 is
 obviously
 a
 wake
 up
 play
 as


well.


>> Yeah.


>> Time
 frame
 is
 a
 couple
 years
 on
 this.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 That's
 it.
 That's
 that's
 by


that's
 your
 spot.
 16.
 Well,
 you
 should


know.
 We
 don't
 know.
 No,
 but
 like
 as


close
 to
 16
 as
 you
 can.
 That's
 your


That's
 your
 That's
 your
 That's
 a
 spot.


Um


it
 it
 can
 go
 deeper
 which
 puts
 it


towards
 14
 just
 above
 14.
 So
 as
 close
 to


15
 couple
 years
 as
 close
 to
 15
 as
 you


can


like
 this.
 So
 weekly
 couple
 years
 I'm


actually
 going
 to
 go
 to
 monthly


and
 you
 can
 expect
 this
 to
 be
 like
 one


two
 three
 maybe
 four
 shots.
 So
 in


between
 this
 I
 would
 expect
 this


like
 that
 right.
 Um,
 so,
 so
 my


accumulation
 range
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in


this
 15


to
 16
 area,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 why
 I
 said


what
 I'm
 saying.
 Why
 I
 said
 what
 I'm


saying
 what
 I've
 said
 what
 I
 why
 I
 said


what
 I
 said.
 And
 we're
 looking
 for
 20s


on
 an
 extension


in
 here.


Cool.


Soundown
 six
 months.


>> Sound
 down
 six
 months.
 Six
 months
 is
 uh


well


so
 this
 uh


6
 months
 on
 a
 daily


and
 you're
 really
 looking
 at
 this


situation
 here.


So,
 this
 is


this
 is
 an
 extension
 of
 this


consolidation
 here,
 which
 puts
 you
 right


there.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 one
 other


way.
 And
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go
 from
 here


to
 here
 and
 get
 my
 bare
 zones.


We're
 well
 above
 it.
 So,
 that's
 probably


why
 I
 didn't
 do
 that.
 So,
 at
 15.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 cleaner
 this
 is
 much
 cleaner


chart
 than
 big
 bear.
 Um,
 it's
 still


giving
 me
 22s,


which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 that
 this
 fair


value
 gap
 right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


all
 pretty
 much
 mapped
 out
 um


as
 it
 is.
 I
 think
 you
 you
 screenshot


this
 and
 you
 run
 with
 this
 and
 you
 want


to
 see
 this
 going
 kind
 of
 go
 level
 to


level
 like
 that


right
 there.
 You
 can
 kind
 of
 chop.
 You


might
 even
 get
 a
 little
 slop.


That's
 what
 you're
 looking
 for.
 At
 any


point
 if
 you
 lose,
 let's
 say,
 one
 of


these
 major
 levels,
 okay?
 Well,
 then
 you


know
 that
 you
 go
 down.
 Or
 if
 you
 lose


this
 broader


um
 trajectory
 here,
 you're
 just
 on
 that.


So,
 this
 can
 go
 sideways.


If
 it
 does,
 that's
 fine.
 Just
 know
 these


are


all
 in
 play.
 So,
 as
 close
 to


this
 area
 as
 you
 can
 is
 your
 prevailing


uptrend


wherever
 that
 happens
 to
 be.


>> Okay.


Um
 arm
 six
 months.


>> I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 six
 months.


Um,


missed
 this
 one.
 This
 one
 did
 me
 dirty.


Well,
 didn't
 do
 me
 dirty.
 I
 just
 I
 just


It
 just
 again,


Pokemon
 can't
 catch
 them
 all.


Is
 a
 This
 is
 a
 quick
 This
 is
 a
 these
 are


quick
 and
 dirty.
 This
 is
 a
 extreme
 high


beta.
 Um,


yeah.


Well,
 150
 was
 the
 major
 pivot.
 135
 I


knew.
 I
 should
 have
 known.
 I
 I
 knew


that.
 I'm
 just
 a
 little
 disappointed
 in


myself
 here
 for
 not
 having
 this
 one
 on.


This
 is
 um


you
 know,
 I
 take
 this
 trade
 all
 the
 time


because
 I
 know
 that
 this
 has
 been


happening.
 So,
 we're
 one,
 two,
 three.


This
 is


Wow.
 I'm
 just
 so
 frustrated
 here.


Whatever.
 Um
 because
 I
 trade
 this
 a
 lot.


Oh,
 I'm
 gonna
 cry.
 All
 right.
 So,
 that


said,
 it's
 okay.
 It's
 okay.
 Um,


I


think
 that
 this
 is
 more
 in
 this
 area.


So,
 we
 will
 probably


have
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 pullback


in
 here.
 We're
 going
 to
 retest.
 I'm


getting
 a
 little
 fancy
 because
 I'm


somewhat
 interested
 here.


Uh,


I
 got
 a
 couple
 seconds
 to
 find
 this


level.


159
 and
 155.
 So,
 159
 and
 155.


Kablammo
 Gabmo.
 That's
 where
 I'm
 looking


for.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be


wowers.


Screenshot
 it.
 Whatever.


Just
 under


two.


>> Just
 under
 200.


>> Okay.
 Um


>> Oh,
 frustrating.
 So,
 it's
 the
 first
 It's


the
 first
 one.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 so
 I


don't
 know
 that
 it's
 like
 you
 have
 to


chase
 this
 if
 if
 this
 doesn't
 hold
 right


here.
 Like,
 just
 know
 that
 this
 can
 come


deep.


But


there
 you
 have
 it.


>> TMC
 6
 months.


TMZ.


>> TMC.


>> TSM.


>> No,
 no.
 TMC,
 the
 Metals
 Company.
 This
 is


a
 Rare
 Earth
 10X.


>> I
 don't
 know
 this
 one.


>> The
 Rare
 Earth
 stuff
 helped
 it
 a
 lot.


I
 mean,
 I
 don't know.
 It
 It
 went


parabolic.
 So,
 the
 question
 is,
 do
 you


think
 it's
 legit


from
 here?


>> Is
 it
 more
 legit
 than
 uh
 AKMS?
 Exactly.


>> Too
 legit
 to


I
 mean
 as
 a
 target
 it's
 a
 full


extension.


Um


so
 act
 right
 needs
 to
 look
 like
 here


12
 it
 can
 and
 then
 it
 can
 do
 this
 and


then
 it
 can
 do
 that.
 That's
 what
 acting


right
 needs
 to
 look
 like.
 So
 that's
 15s.


Uh
 not
 acting
 right.
 Uh-huh.
 Looks
 like


uh


not
 acting
 right.


Looks
 like
 this


later,
 which
 puts
 you
 into
 the
 sevens.


These
 are
 these
 are
 this
 is
 uh
 you
 know


not
 for
 the
 faint-hearted.


Okay.
 Uh,


>> yeah,
 I'm
 doing
 them
 though.


>> Same
 theme.
 MP
 for
 the
 next
 year.


>> Uh,
 MP
 is
 not
 I
 mean
 MP
 is
 it's
 a
 theme.


It's
 a
 theme,
 but
 it's
 not.
 Dude,
 this


is
 sturdy.


Um,
 dude,
 whoever
 asked
 this
 the
 other


day
 and
 I
 looked
 at
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 would


have
 thought
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be


done
 and
 we
 looked
 at
 it
 on
 the
 show
 and


I
 was
 like,
 but
 it's
 holding
 right
 here.


And
 I
 remember
 looking
 at
 this
 and
 I'm


like,
 okay.
 And
 that's
 interesting


because
 that's
 like
 uh
 prior
 the


breakout
 is
 acting
 as
 support.
 So
 like


if
 it
 was
 going
 to
 break
 down
 it
 would


have
 done
 that
 and
 it
 didn't.
 Then
 all


of a
 sudden,


um,
 so
 there's
 that
 story,


you're
 there.
 Um,


I
 don't even
 know
 why
 I'm
 measuring
 this


because
 we
 know
 what
 it
 is.
 It's
 125.


Uh,
 and
 acting
 right
 needs
 to
 look
 like


this,


this,


that.
 Uh,


in
 the
 meantime,
 what
 could
 a
 pullback


look
 like?


I
 feel
 like
 if
 if
 it
 sees
 65s
 again,


people
 would
 get
 really
 excited.


>> What
 83s
 remains
 that
 breakout,


>> but
 um
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 get


83s.
 Actually,
 I
 think
 this
 morning
 wick


might
 have
 been
 it.
 It's
 this
 is
 the


rule
 of
 like
 stocks
 that
 cross
 over
 75


that
 go
 to
 125.
 You're
 there.


Okay.
 Uh,
 ALAB
 six
 months.
 This
 one
 got


hit
 with
 the
 Oracle
 AMD
 news
 this


morning,


>> which
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 bearish.


>> Also,
 Broadcom.


>> So,
 it
 got
 the
 the
 quadruple
 whammy
 one,


two,
 three,
 triple
 whammy.
 So,
 uh,
 a
 lot


of
 custom
 silicon
 stuff.
 Marbell's


actually
 having
 a
 little
 similar
 stuff,


um,
 as
 well.
 But
 I
 think
 they
 I
 think
 uh


custom
 silicon
 is
 like


this
 is
 probably
 end
 up
 being
 an


opportunity.
 I
 almost
 bought
 this
 today.


Um


I
 need
 to
 go
 uh
 when
 are
 you
 coming
 down


next?


>> San
 Francisco.


>> San
 Jose.


>> Probably
 next
 year.
 Early
 next
 year.


>> You
 want
 to
 call
 these
 guys
 up
 and
 see


if
 we
 can
 swing
 by
 and
 meet
 the
 CEO?


How
 how
 much
 how
 much
 pull
 do
 you
 think


I
 have,
 bro?
 Just
 call
 these.


>> We're
 not
 talking
 about
 you.
 I'll
 talk


I'll
 talk
 to
 them.


>> Okay.
 So,
 then
 you
 call
 them.
 I'm
 down


if
 you're
 down.


>> Yeah.
 If
 I
 can
 make
 it
 happen.
 Um


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 them,
 but
 I


think
 13%
 down
 because
 of
 a
 Oracle


headline
 is
 not
 as
 reasonable.


>> We
 could
 probably
 just
 tour
 worst
 case


scenario.
 See
 if
 I
 know
 some
 people.
 Um


150s


looks
 good.
 Um,
 but
 it
 is
 broken
 trend.


I
 think
 this
 is
 how
 this
 rolls.
 It's


very
 high
 beta.
 Broken
 trend.
 But
 just


this
 from
 that
 last
 breakout


does
 put
 me
 like
 this
 is
 the
 spot.


This
 is
 the
 spot.
 145


gets
 me
 really
 interested.


Um
 although
 that
 said
 I
 I
 did
 have
 this


on
 watch
 as
 a
 potential
 um
 extension
 and


it
 didn't
 get
 through
 it
 anyways.
 Right.


So
 like
 this
 is
 why
 we
 do
 that
 bear
 that


bare
 exercise
 because
 knowing
 when
 to


press
 that
 bet.
 Here's
 that
 bearish


retracement.


I
 needed
 to
 see
 it
 close
 over
 233.


It
 didn't
 get
 there.
 Two
 or
 223
 22450.


That's
 a
 bearish
 retracement.
 That's


what
 that's
 when
 a
 bearish
 retracement


goes
 bad
 for
 the
 bulls.
 But
 this
 is
 why


we
 always
 watch
 for
 this.
 And
 um
 in
 this


instance,
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do
 is
 we
 want


to
 do
 that.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 extension.


You're
 here.
 Yeah.
 So
 again,
 um


I'm
 here.
 I
 have
 confluence
 multiways


155s


to
 if
 it
 gets
 out
 of
 control
 140.


>> Okay.


Um,


Intel
 one
 year


>> by


>> really


>> I
 mean
 yeah


one
 year
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 one
 year


one
 year


>> one
 year


Yeah.
 Sentiment,
 just
 sentiment
 alone.


Um


>> I
 mean
 Trump's
 not
 going
 to
 let
 them


fail,
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 well,
 we
 knew
 it
 was
 under
 book


at
 20ome,
 but
 there
 was
 no
 reason
 to
 get


excited.


It's
 well
 above
 20ome,
 which
 is
 fine.


Um,
 it's
 not
 about
 that,
 though.
 It's


about
 it's
 about
 the
 sentiment
 changing.


So,
 let's
 go
 ahead
 and
 do
 the
 exercise


because
 I
 haven't
 done
 this.
 Yeah,
 I


might
 have
 to
 take
 it
 back.
 Um,
 bearish


retracement
 slapped
 her.


Oh,
 I
 almost
 spoke
 to
 him.
 Maybe
 I
 might


have
 spoken
 too
 soon.
 3950
 was
 it.
 So,


for
 this
 to
 act
 right,
 it
 has
 to
 hold.


3450.
 3475,
 which
 quite
 frankly,
 it


still
 it
 still
 kind
 of
 puts
 it
 as
 like


if
 you're
 going
 to
 act
 right,
 this
 is


kind
 of
 where
 you
 want
 to
 see
 this
 chop,


get
 a
 little
 slop,
 then
 make
 another


run.
 You
 could
 chop
 in
 here,
 make


another
 run.
 But
 that's
 that's
 what
 that


needs
 to
 look
 like.
 Um
 and
 then
 in
 this


instance,
 um


this
 is
 Yeah.
 45s


possibly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 yes,


I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 I
 need
 to
 I


think
 you
 might
 need
 to
 broaden
 your


time
 horizon,
 though.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 JD,
 same
 time
 frame,
 one
 year.


Oh,
 bye.


>> Um,


>> dude,
 the
 amount
 of
 OP
 when
 you
 showed


me
 that
 picture,
 80,000
 calls
 open
 for


the
 40.
 That's
 old
 Jake,
 by
 the
 way.
 I


think
 Jake
 called
 that
 out
 to
 his


subscribers.
 And


>> Jake,
 really?


>> Yeah.
 Jake
 owns
 like
 2,000
 of
 those


contracts.
 The
 $40
 call.


>> I
 have
 marches.
 Um,


Jake
 is
 not
 Let
 me
 just
 tell
 you
 about


Jake.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 I'll
 call
 him
 if


you
 need
 to,
 but
 he's
 not
 a
 he's
 not
 an


options
 guy.
 I'm
 an
 options
 guy.
 Jake
 is


a
 stock
 guy.


Jake
 is
 not
 an
 options
 guy.
 So,


>> yeah,
 he
 likes
 the
 stock,
 but
 he
 does


not
 know
 the
 Greeks.


He
 knows
 them
 in
 concept.
 Um,


>> so
 you
 like
 JD
 for
 a
 year?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 like
 Jake,
 let's
 be
 like


straight.
 But
 um


but
 um


but
 yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 like
 it's
 the
 same
 thing


actually.
 So
 this
 re
 So
 this
 is
 the


setup.
 It's
 like
 a
 big
 base.
 This
 is
 the


PayPal
 setup.
 This
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.


This
 is
 the
 Coinbase
 setup.
 how
 how


Coinbase
 initially
 started
 is
 like
 you


get
 this
 um
 this
 is
 and
 I
 think
 I
 think


if
 you
 side
 note
 if
 you
 get
 a
 bounce
 on


CRM
 I
 think
 that
 you
 expect
 exactly
 this


to
 happen
 in
 the
 future
 is
 you
 get
 this


big
 move
 and
 then
 another
 pullback


retest
 it
 and
 then
 you
 start
 to
 see
 it


kind
 of
 do
 this
 thing
 again.
 So
 30,
 I


don't
 think
 um
 that
 you
 have
 a
 stop
 on


this.
 I
 just
 think
 that
 you
 you
 take


your
 shot.
 Um
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 so


policy
 driven
 or
 sentiment
 driven
 that


if
 you
 stop
 out
 of
 this,


it's
 all
 about
 sizing.
 I
 don't
 think
 you


need
 to
 have
 a
 huge
 size
 here


uh
 to
 have
 a
 good
 win
 here
 either.
 But
 I


think
 this
 is
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 a


it's
 not
 a
 thing.
 This
 is
 the
 spot.
 This


is
 it.


This
 is
 the
 This
 is
 where
 you
 want
 to


take
 the
 shot.
 Uh,
 can
 it
 come
 down
 a


little
 bit
 lower?
 Yes,
 sure.
 But
 do
 you


want
 to
 really
 like
 hold
 out
 for
 exactly


that?
 This
 is
 pretty
 deep
 into
 it.


>> Uh,
 AMKR
 one
 year.
 Me
 and
 me
 and
 Stock


Talk
 are
 both
 in
 this
 one.


>> Someone
 asked
 me
 about
 this
 on
 my


channel.


is
 a
 manufacturer,
 right?
 Um,


>> packaging
 company.


>> Is
 it
 for


>> Yeah,
 packaging
 for
 semiconductors.


>> I
 thought
 it
 was
 a


Oh,
 packaging


testing.


I


Is
 this
 the
 outsourcing
 company?


>> Yeah.
 Yep.
 OSAP.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 like
 it
 because
 it


trades
 at
 1.15
 time
 sales,


>> but
 they're
 they're
 outsourcing.


Um,
 okay.
 Sorry.
 Go
 ahead.


>> They're
 cheap.
 They're
 working
 really


closely
 with
 TSM
 for
 the
 fab
 in
 Arizona.


And
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 onshoring
 any


semiconductor
 manufacturing
 in
 the


states,
 it
 seems
 like
 Amcore
 is
 going to


be
 a
 pretty
 is
 it
 reminds
 me
 of
 SMCI
 in


23.
 Like,
 it
 seems
 like
 they're
 going
 to


play
 a
 big
 role
 in
 something
 that's


about
 to
 happen.
 It's
 just
 secluded
 to


the
 US.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 I
 think
 it's
 a


double
 on
 revenues
 in
 a
 year.
 So
 six


billion
 to
 12
 billion
 revenues
 and
 that


gets
 you
 closer
 to
 like
 4550
 bucks
 in


terms
 of
 the
 stock
 price.


>> So
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 TA
 matters
 that


much
 on
 it,
 but
 you
 know


>> it
 does.


>> Um
 26
 is
 a
 good
 spot.
 This
 is
 your


prevailing
 uptrend
 right
 here.
 So
 all
 of


this


so
 it's
 it
 it
 TA
 always
 matters
 in
 terms


of
 like


can
 you
 get
 a
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 matter


in
 terms
 of
 the
 general
 direction
 to


your
 point
 no
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 but
 but


can
 it
 can
 it
 matter
 in
 terms
 of
 your


when
 you
 when
 you
 learn
 how
 to
 trade
 and


you
 can


trade
 into
 an
 investment
 can
 you
 can
 you


like
 mold
 multiply
 your
 compounded


returns
 that
 you
 would
 have
 to
 normally


just
 wait
 to
 get
 for
 sure
 like
 from
 that


perspective
 TA
 would
 matter
 um
 and
 it


would
 help
 right
 so
 like
 all
 all
 I'll


say
 is
 like
 this
 can
 come
 in
 I
 think


this
 is
 fine
 but
 um


trade
 location
 probably
 closer
 from
 a


time
 perspective
 it
 can
 go
 sideways
 for


another
 couple
 weeks
 maybe
 into


earnings.
 Uh
 and
 if
 you
 get
 something


closer
 to
 20
 just
 slightly
 sub
 27


really
 whatever
 this
 order
 block
 was


here
 retest
 this
 area
 right
 here.


>> Agreed.


>> That
 would
 be
 that
 would
 be
 good.


>> All
 right
 we'll
 do
 10
 more
 minutes
 then


we
 got
 to
 get
 Jason
 out
 of
 here.
 Jason,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being
 here
 every


week.
 I'm
 putting
 Jason's
 Twitter
 and


YouTube
 in
 the
 chat.
 Again,
 you
 can


follow
 uh
 his
 Discord.
 He
 has
 a
 private


group
 as
 well
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to
 get


deeper
 into
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 he's


doing.
 You
 can
 check
 him
 out.
 Uh
 VG,
 one


year,
 this
 bad
 boy
 got
 hit
 with
 a
 BP


lawsuit.


>> Um
 uh


I
 I
 think
 they're
 in
 a
 legal
 battle
 for


the
 next
 year.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


anything.


>> That's
 what
 the
 TA
 tells
 me.


>> TA
 tells
 me
 that
 there's
 something
 new


uh
 that
 was
 uh
 that
 changed
 the
 story
 on


October
 9th
 that
 might
 have
 uncovered


some
 kind
 of
 new
 story.
 And
 it
 tells
 me


now
 that
 this
 is
 the
 low


um
 that
 it's
 retesting


and
 it
 it
 should
 hold
 here.
 But
 if
 it


doesn't,
 then
 it's
 possible
 that
 this


goes
 lower.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 question
 is


like
 where


uh


five.


So
 there's
 a
 couple
 like
 the
 trajectory


to
 get
 there.


I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the


stock,
 but
 it's
 just
 telling
 me
 that


well,
 we're
 need
 to
 price
 you
 back
 into


March
 of
 2025.
 So,
 whatever
 is
 happening


today


is
 putting
 this
 in
 the
 time
 machine
 back


to
 whatever
 was
 happening
 with
 the
 stock


in
 early
 20
 early
 2025.
 Um,
 so
 whatever


the
 stock
 was
 dealing
 with
 in
 2025,
 is


it
 better
 or
 worse
 is
 the
 question.


That's
 really
 it.
 And
 so
 780s


is
 really
 like
 where
 you
 could
 kind
 of


go
 to
 next
 assuming
 that
 there's
 no
 what


did
 you
 say
 it
 was?


>> A
 BP
 something.


>> BP
 lawsuit.
 Arbitration
 case.
 Yeah.


>> Arbitration
 case.
 So
 um
 only
 being


somewhat
 familiar
 with
 it.
 You
 just
 need


to
 know
 like
 what
 are
 the
 other


arbitration
 risks?
 Are
 there
 other


similar
 lawsuits?
 And
 I
 think
 that
 to


the
 extent
 of
 that,
 if
 there
 are,
 that's


the
 only
 thing
 that
 would
 keep
 a
 a
 cap


on
 the
 stock.


Um,
 and
 then
 see
 this
 right
 here
 where


this
 this
 prior
 breakout
 was


and
 this
 breakdown
 area
 and
 this
 little


blip
 on
 the
 radar
 here.
 So,
 that's
 10.


I'm
 going to
 zoom
 in
 just
 a
 little bit.


And
 I
 know
 I'm
 a
 little
 over
 on
 this


one,
 but
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 10:45.


861


puts
 you
 right
 here.


That's
 a
 critical
 spot


and
 puts
 you
 back
 into
 this


heavy
 volume
 like
 cons
 like
 investor


base.
 So,
 whoever
 is
 buying
 here,


maybe
 they
 took
 some
 profit,
 but
 now


they're
 getting
 their
 initial
 cost
 back.


So,
 they
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 take
 the
 shot


one
 more
 time.
 Do
 they
 double
 dip
 here


and
 now?
 Or
 do
 they
 say
 the
 story
 has


changed?
 That's
 the
 question.
 Um,
 from


here,
 this
 will
 say
 that
 the
 story
 has


changed
 if
 if
 it's
 over
 that
 1040.


Um,


and
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go
 a
 little
 bit


deeper.


So,


maybe
 not
 even
 1040.
 1050.


So,
 right
 here.
 So,
 this
 is
 your


secondary
 breakdown.
 And
 I'll
 do
 one


more
 from
 the
 actual
 whatever
 news


candle
 it
 is.


I
 don't
 have
 a
 higher
 low
 yet.


Technically,
 I
 still
 have
 lower
 lows.


So,
 we're
 still
 making
 daily
 lower
 lows


and
 we're
 still
 making
 daily
 lower


highs.
 So,
 you
 want
 this
 trend
 to
 really


um
 go
 away


first
 because
 you're
 in
 a
 like
 somewhat


down
 channel.
 You're
 getting


consolidated.
 So,
 that's
 better.
 Stop


getting
 lower.
 You
 don't
 want
 this
 to


close
 below
 880.
 Um,
 and
 then
 at
 975


over
 975,
 this
 is
 when
 you're
 going
 to


start
 to
 be
 on
 the
 mend
 way
 over
 here.


And
 you
 could
 get
 this
 kind
 of
 a


pullback
 and
 you
 might
 see
 something


like
 that.
 At
 975,
 you
 get
 to
 10
 1054.


You
 might
 even
 get
 a
 big
 shot.
 There


might
 be
 some
 kind
 of
 case
 something.


Then
 you
 need
 to
 be
 cautious
 at
 around


11.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 this
 happen.


But
 if
 you
 do,
 this
 is
 your
 pathing
 to


recovery.
 That's
 it.


>> So,
 following
 up
 on
 this,
 quick
 thoughts


on
 next,
 just
 on
 the
 chart
 in
 general,


NEXD.


>> Uh,
 I
 only
 just
 cuz
 I
 I
 had
 an
 inkling


of
 what
 was
 going
 on
 with
 VG,
 but
 not


really
 next.
 Um,


timers.
 So,
 what
 is
 this
 the
 same
 story?


I
 don't
 know
 what's
 happening
 here,
 but


this
 looks
 um


>> this
 is
 pre-revenue
 oil
 and
 gas,


but
 does
 the
 chart


>> I
 I
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 I
 feel
 like
 oil


and
 gas
 becomes
 a
 positional
 trade
 here.


Anyways,


um
 because
 like
 like
 if
 you
 were
 to
 talk


to
 the
 milkman,
 I
 I'm
 sure
 that
 he
 will


he
 will
 he
 will
 probably


um
 tell
 you
 the
 same
 thing
 that
 in


reality
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 that
 gas
 and


oil
 and
 gas
 that
 really
 come
 to
 save
 the


day,
 believe
 it
 or
 not.
 Right.
 But


people
 don't
 want
 to
 hear
 that.
 So
 while


do
 these
 are
 these
 is
 this
 a
 producer?


I
 don't
 fully
 know.
 I
 think
 they're


upstream
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


>> Need
 to
 buy
 it


position.


>> The
 insiders
 are
 buying
 like
 crazy.


That's
 the
 one


>> I
 would
 buy
 it.
 Uh
 it's
 a
 200
 weeks


simple
 moving
 without
 knowing
 anything


with
 without
 knowing
 anything
 about
 this


company.
 It
 looks
 like
 a
 buy.
 Um


I'm
 not
 actually
 joking.
 Um


th
 this


looks
 like
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 in
 an
 it


looks
 like
 a
 investment
 buy
 possible


positional
 buy


breakout
 pullback
 retest
 into
 supply


200
 week
 simple
 moving
 average.
 Can
 it


go
 lower?
 Sure.
 Can
 you
 get
 to
 maybe


five?
 Sure.
 But
 you
 know
 am
 I
 going
 to


be
 picky?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe
 I
 need
 to


buy
 this
 right
 now.
 Um
 yeah.


So


>> I
 actually
 agree.
 I
 do
 think
 at
 these


levels
 it's
 probably
 you
 probably
 throw


a
 couple
 thousand
 at
 it
 and
 just


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 but
 so
 my
 point
 is
 that


in
 reality
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 this
 sector


that
 saves
 a
 day.
 Um
 maybe
 not
 gas.
 Uh


but
 pathing
 needs
 to
 look
 like
 this.


Then
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 that
 bare


zone
 which
 is
 $10
 950.
 And
 then
 here


maybe
 you
 could
 get
 a
 little
 pullback


and
 you
 get
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 thing.


That's
 it.
 Worst
 case
 scenario,
 you
 get


below
 five
 and
 then
 you
 know,
 well,
 you


took
 a
 shot
 and
 it
 wasn't
 good.
 And
 and


what
 does
 not
 good
 look
 like?
 Well,
 I'll


tell
 you
 what
 not
 good
 looks
 like.
 Not


good
 for
 now
 looks
 like
 a
 straight
 shot


to
 possibly
 three.
 Uh
 if
 there's
 like


no,
 let's
 see.
 Reality
 four


to
 this
 lower
 range
 here.


In
 reality,
 if
 it
 if
 all
 hell
 breaks


loose
 and
 you
 lose
 that,
 you're
 into


four.
 So,
 what
 am
 I
 risking
 here?
 I


don't
 know.
 I'm
 risking
 an
 upside
 of


100%
 or
 no,
 I'm
 I'm
 sorry.
 I'm
 risking
 a


downside
 of
 30%,
 to
 make
 an
 upside
 of


100%.
 That
 is
 what
 we
 call
 riskreward


um
 in
 trading.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 that


sets
 up
 as
 a
 dude,
 I'm
 just


that's
 risk
 management.
 If
 my
 if
 my
 risk


management
 is
 giving
 me
 risk
 one
 to
 make


four,


it's
 not
 bad.


>> No,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 mean


>> statistical


>> like
 from
 a
 statistical
 perspective
 if
 I


take
 four
 shots
 like
 this
 and
 I
 win
 one


of
 them
 with
 risking
 one
 to
 make
 four


plus
 and
 I
 have
 a
 25%
 written
 rate
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 positive
 in
 my
 trading


account.


>> Yeah.
 Also
 I
 mean
 just
 look
 at
 this


right
 here.
 Like
 if
 we
 get
 a
 little
 bit


fundamental


the
 insiders
 were
 buying
 at
 freaking


750.
 Bro,
 look
 at
 this
 [ __ ]
 7:30,
 714,


and
 they're
 buying
 in
 bulk.
 500,000


shares,
 300,000
 shares.
 This
 was
 all


September
 2025,
 bro.
 This
 was
 last


month.


>> And
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 the


industry,
 but
 at
 its
 core,
 a
 stock
 down


two
 bucks
 below
 where
 the
 insiders


bought,
 you
 probably
 take
 a
 nibble
 and


but
 but
 then
 you
 can't
 look
 at
 it.
 You


can't
 cry
 if
 it
 goes
 up
 or
 down.
 You


just
 got
 to


>> let
 it
 play
 out.


>> No.
 But
 this
 is
 one
 where
 like
 you
 could


take
 you
 could
 take
 four
 shots
 like
 this


and
 and
 lose
 75%
 of
 them
 and
 still
 be


positive
 in
 a
 trading
 account.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 a
 longer
 time
 horizon


>> on


>> Oh,
 we're
 still
 going.


>> Shoot.
 I
 went
 over
 because
 I
 thought
 was


it.


>> Okay.
 You
 want
 to
 do
 one
 more?
 One
 last


one
 and
 we'll
 get
 you
 out
 of
 here.


>> Opportunity
 cost.
 That
 that
 has
 to
 do


with
 sizing.


Yeah.
 No,
 let
 me
 do
 it.
 Let's
 go.


>> Okay.
 Last
 three.
 ISRG
 one
 to
 three


years


>> intuitive
 surgical
 um
 I
 mean
 uh


yeah
 do
 we
 look
 at
 med
 medtech
 medronics


um
 is
 uh
 how
 much
 do
 you
 believe
 in


robotics
 I
 guess
 uh
 uh


it's
 not
 Da
 Vinci
 is
 it
 is
 it
 Da
 Vinci


this
 Da
 Vinci
 I
 think
 it
 is
 um


>> yeah
 no
 it
 is
 Da
 Vinci


>> he's
 earnings
 on
 the
 21st
 Uh,


okay.


It's
 a
 spot.
 I
 didn't
 hit
 the
 timer.


Shoot.


It
 looks
 good.
 One
 year.


>> Yep.
 One
 year.


>> Nibble.


Because
 you're
 you
 have
 earnings


only
 like
 if
 it's
 a
 new
 position.
 I


mean,
 this
 looks
 good,
 but
 if
 it
 if
 it


breaks
 down,
 it
 could
 get
 uglier


and
 you
 could
 get
 a
 deeper
 discount


towards
 the
 360s.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 fine.


Um


but
 under
 400
 could
 come


and
 assuming
 that
 they
 are


firing
 on
 all
 cylinders.
 It's
 all
 good.


You
 want
 to
 uh
 you
 want
 to
 monitor


market
 sentiment,
 healthc
 care
 first,


biotech,
 and
 then
 medtech.
 This
 is


medtech.


So,
 you're
 you're
 late
 cycle
 here.
 All


right.


>> Okay.
 Last
 two.
 TMDX
 one
 year.


>> I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 this
 one
 in
 a
 long


time,
 to
 be
 honest.


Um,


stay
 the
 course,
 no
 change.
 Uh,
 this


guy.


Yeah,
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't
 go
 out


hoping
 for
 anything
 crazy.
 This
 is


definitely
 in
 consolidation.


Uh,
 you
 you
 you
 definitely
 hit
 like
 I


know
 I
 was
 shorting
 this
 for
 a
 minute


and
 then
 it
 stopped
 going
 down.
 It
 went


up,
 but
 it
 it
 it
 hit
 that
 bare
 zone.


You're
 below
 that
 50%
 mark
 here.
 This
 is


small
 cap.


It's
 possible
 that
 this


loses
 this
 area
 right
 now


for
 a
 a
 better


entry,


but
 I
 would
 be
 very
 cautious
 on
 this


kind
 of
 stock.


um
 because
 it
 can
 just
 blow
 past
 your


levels.
 Uh
 92
 looks
 like
 a
 more


supportive
 level,


which
 would
 be
 like
 this,


but
 then
 you
 still
 need
 to
 get
 through.


And
 this
 actually
 would
 play
 out
 better


to
 your
 pattern
 people


uh
 in
 a
 more
 constructive


teacup


if
 they
 like
 that.


>> All
 right.
 Um


>> someone
 as


I
 think
 it's
 gonna
 be
 similar.
 Sorry.


>> Oh,
 good.


>> Was
 that
 one?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> It
 was
 one
 of
 them.
 But
 go
 ahead.


>> Um


it
 just
 it
 just
 looks
 uh
 I
 if
 you
 have


to
 go,
 we
 have
 to
 go.
 Just
 let
 me
 know.


Um


>> I
 I
 can
 stay.
 It's
 up
 to
 you.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 this
 was
 like
 a
 three
 to


six
 month
 also.
 Something
 about
 flow.


It's
 It's
 bottom
 of
 the
 channel.
 Um


it's
 actually
 just
 channel
 up.
 This
 is


This
 is
 one
 of
 your
 stocks,
 isn't
 it?


>> It's
 Pelosi
 stocks,
 not
 mine.
 Oh,
 I


thought
 you
 were
 doing
 the
 copy
 policy


portfolio.


>> Copied
 Google,
 but


>> do
 you
 still
 have
 it?


>> Google?
 Yes,


>> you
 do.
 Huh?


>> Tempest.
 No.


>> What
 are
 you
 eating?


>> I'm
 not
 eating
 anything,
 bro.


>> Oh,


>> why
 do
 you
 think?


>> How's
 the
 tooth?


>> I
 thought
 you
 were
 eating
 something.


>> No,


>> tooth
 is
 good.
 I
 just
 need
 to
 use
 this


other
 channel.


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 on
 the
 20.
 It's
 not


strong.


I
 don't
 really
 like
 it
 that
 much
 to
 be


honest.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 it's
 AI.
 It's
 on


the
 20.


>> Okay.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say,


>> can
 we
 split
 the
 last
 minute
 30
 real


quick
 between
 Dutch
 Bros,
 NC,


and
 DLO?


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 I
 got
 this
 uh
 I
 got
 it


on
 Tempest.
 It's
 closer
 to
 80
 450
 bottom


of
 the
 channel.
 Boom.
 Right
 there.
 Dutch


Bros.
 Um,


apparently
 they're
 coming
 up
 with
 a
 new


there's
 a
 new
 Dutch
 Bros
 coming
 to
 town,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 cool.


>> Oh,
 in
 California.


>> Yeah,
 they
 don't
 they
 don't
 exist
 in


California.
 There's
 a
 big
 old
 Dubé


bottom
 that
 um
 a
 mate
 text
 me
 about
 the


other
 day.
 He's
 like,
 "Is
 this
 just
 a


screaming
 by?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Dude,
 I


don't
 know,
 man."
 Um,


don't
 hate
 it.
 Don't
 hate
 it
 at
 all.


Saved
 it.
 We
 need
 to
 go
 over
 here
 and


say
 this
 can
 this
 can
 make


this
 can
 make
 its
 way


at
 least
 to
 57


for
 now.
 pre-
 earnings.


Uh
 yeah,


especially
 if
 this
 gets
 a
 little


pullback
 right
 now.
 I
 do
 like
 this
 here.


So
 like
 especially
 if
 I
 get
 a
 little


slap
 at
 the
 20-day
 and
 then
 if
 I
 get
 a


pullback
 literally
 right
 now
 and
 then
 I


get
 a
 higher
 daily
 low,
 I
 will
 be
 in


this
 bad
 boy
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 ride
 and


likely
 to
 the
 200
 day
 simple.


Yep.


To
 65s,
 which
 I
 would
 love
 that.


>> That's
 a
 tradable
 trade.


>> Um,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 assume
 47
 holds.


>> Your
 last
 two
 are
 NCL
 and
 DLO.


>> NCLH
 I'
 I've
 right
 off
 the
 200
 right


here.


So,
 it's
 it's
 okay.
 Um,
 but
 that's
 not


like
 this
 is
 not
 like
 the
 best
 spot.
 So,


like
 around
 two
 I
 don't
 like
 trading
 a


whole
 lot
 around
 200
 day
 SMA.
 So,
 I


think
 this
 can
 get
 to
 240,
 2480,
 but


then
 you
 you
 really
 got
 to
 be
 careful


cuz
 this
 can
 get
 shellacking
 um
 into
 the


20s,
 which
 I
 think
 would
 be
 a
 better


retest
 of
 this
 general
 area
 cuz
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 this
 was
 like
 a
 high
 and


this
 this
 whole
 thing
 is
 a
 lower
 high.


Um
 and
 this
 was
 the
 last
 low
 and
 this
 is


a
 Oops,
 I
 might
 have
 misspoke.
 Is
 this
 a


higher
 low?


No,
 it
 is
 a
 lower
 low.
 So,
 uh,
 lower


low.
 So,
 lower
 high,
 lower
 low.
 Yeah,
 I


would
 be
 really
 kind
 of
 cautious
 here.


Um,
 it's
 not
 really
 cruise
 season,
 I


don't
 think,
 unless
 you're
 going
 to


Alaska.
 Um,
 so


what's
 the
 time
 frame
 on
 this?
 Is
 a
 long


time
 frame.


Confluence


is
 a
 long
 time
 frame.


Yeah,
 this
 is
 basically
 a
 year,
 year
 or


two
 years.


>> Year
 or
 two
 years,
 I
 don't
 know.
 Uh,


three
 to
 five
 years.
 I'm
 I
 would
 say


like
 more
 like
 that
 $20
 level
 is
 still


going
 to
 be
 better.


I'm
 getting
 this
 like
 all
 kinds
 of


different
 ways
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 looking


at
 this,


but
 you're
 still
 in
 this
 broader
 thing.


The
 only
 way
 that
 this
 breaks
 is
 that
 if


this
 gets
 over,
 which
 would
 be
 the
 same


thing
 here.


All right.
 What
 was
 the
 other
 one?
 DLO


like
 D
 local.


>> Yeah,
 this
 one
 got
 an
 upgrade
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 breakout


Latin
 America
 payments


one-year
 time
 frame
 almost.


Oh,
 that
 that
 that
 does
 not
 look
 bad
 at


all.


It's
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 better
 looking


charts
 I've
 seen
 in
 a
 long
 time,
 dude.


>> I
 think
 upgrade
 was
 to
 19
 today
 that
 I


got.


>> I
 think
 their
 management
 is
 actually


pretty
 strong.
 I'm
 looking
 deeper
 into


this
 company,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 too


crazy
 to
 think
 they
 get
 a
 good
 earnings


get
 rerated.
 Uh
 I
 have
 exactly
 that
 to


20s.
 Um
 from
 so
 so
 weird
 charts
 2095.


Uh


I
 got
 a
 1774
 session
 gap.


Um


yeah.
 So
 I
 mean
 and
 then
 let
 me
 see
 if
 I


have
 this
 extension.
 I
 mean
 I
 have
 uh


this
 all
 lines
 up.
 It


18.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 lines
 up
 all


kinds
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 that
 same


just
 under
 19.


Can
 this
 pull
 back?
 It
 can.


So,
 a
 pullback
 here
 would
 be
 into
 14s


and
 then
 you
 look
 for
 that
 to
 kind
 of


start
 to
 to
 grind
 higher.


You
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 it
 lose
 1350.


Like
 if
 I
 were
 to
 go
 fully
 across
 here


is
 a
 pretty
 heavy
 pivots
 and
 that
 like


you
 can
 but
 um
 it
 means
 that
 if
 you
 do


it
 means
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 to


1250.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


All
 right,
 that
 was
 a
 long
 day.


>> I
 feel
 like
 we
 had
 Okay,


>> we've
 done
 basically
 50
 tickers,
 which


is
 a
 decent
 amount.


>> Really?


>> Yeah,


that
 is
 a
 good
 amount.


>> That
 is
 a
 good
 amount.


Oh,
 dude.
 The
 end
 of
 the
 day,


>> dude.
 We
 just
 got
 Dude,
 he
 did
 it
 again.


I
 just
 looked
 at
 the
 It's


>> the
 soybeans,
 bro.
 It's
 the
 soybeans.


Soybeans.
 Dude,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 a


really
 nice
 green
 reversal
 and
 those


soybeans
 350
 came
 out
 35.


>> Is
 crypto
 flying
 right
 now
 after
 hours?


I'm
 getting
 all
 kinds
 of
 alerts


literally
 right
 now.


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 too
 big
 of
 a


green
 open.
 If
 we
 get
 too
 heavy
 green


open,
 that's
 that's
 not
 going
 to
 be


ideal.


All right.
 Well,
 there's
 Jason.
 You
 can


follow
 him
 on
 X
 if
 you
 want
 to
 join
 his


Discord,
 his
 memberships,
 all
 that
 stuff


is
 in
 papergames.comlinks.


Uh
 earning
 season
 is
 next
 week,
 so


>> I
 Well,
 Tesla's
 Tuesday,
 so
 we're


probably
 not
 doing
 TT
 on
 Tuesday.
 We
 got


to
 find
 a
 time
 to
 reschedule
 it.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 let's
 uh
 let's
 coordinate.
 I


don't
 mind
 doing
 some
 things
 after


hours.


I
 also
 if
 you
 guys
 um


I
 don't
 know
 I
 I
 was
 we're
 so
 I'm


probably
 going
 to
 change
 my
 schedule
 a


little
 bit
 too.
 Um
 I
 don't
 mind
 is
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 be
 day
 trading
 as
 much
 but


I
 don't
 mind
 coming
 in
 because
 of
 that.


I
 don't
 mind
 coming
 in
 for
 a
 day
 like


intraday
 segment.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 or


>> the
 thing
 is
 the
 thing
 is


>> yeah
 we
 might
 we
 might
 just
 have
 to
 wait


until
 earnings
 are
 done
 which
 is
 two


weeks
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff
 you're


going
 to
 be
 like
 you
 can
 give
 some


insight
 but
 you
 know
 if
 earnings
 for


meta
 are
 tomorrow
 what
 do
 you
 say
 right


>> that's
 true
 yeah
 so
 like


>> earning
 season
 typically
 just
 for


everybody
 who's
 not
 familiar


fundamentals
 supersede
 technicals


sentiment
 supersedes
 technicals
 um
 Yeah,


it


when
 we
 come
 down
 to
 earning
 season,


what
 happens
 is
 that
 the
 fundamental


stories,
 you
 know,
 think
 back
 to
 when
 I


was
 talking
 about
 PayPal.
 If
 we
 look
 at


the
 time
 stamp
 when
 I
 said
 like


something
 fundamentally
 will
 change
 on


for
 the
 company,
 this
 is
 a
 moment
 in
 the


market
 where
 we
 can
 see
 the
 fundamental


stories
 start
 to
 shift.
 So,
 technicals


will
 get
 swapped
 around
 a
 little
 bit.
 So


it's
 more
 it's
 almost
 like
 a
 quarterly


reset
 um
 from
 a
 technical
 perspective


especially
 for
 mega
 caps
 and
 things
 like


that.
 But
 what
 I
 will
 say
 to
 you
 is
 that


we
 go
 sector
 by
 sector
 when
 we
 talk


about
 earnings.
 So
 it's
 financials


first.
 We
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


financials
 come
 in
 this
 week
 but
 after


after
 financials
 report
 we
 can
 start


looking
 at
 financials.
 But
 every
 week


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 different
 cohort


that
 tend
 to
 report
 together.
 It's
 just


that
 one
 sector
 for
 that
 one
 week
 that


we
 won't
 really
 be
 able
 to
 look
 at.
 Um


but
 so
 about
 a
 third
 of
 the
 tickers
 we'd


have
 to
 be
 like
 ah
 you
 know
 today
 it
 was


ASML.
 If
 they
 report
 tonight,
 tomorrow


morning
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 it's


going
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 look
 at


the
 chart
 on.


>> Okay.
 So
 we'll
 figure
 it
 out.
 We'll
 see


what
 we
 got
 to
 do.


>> Um
 all right,
 good.
 I
 think
 your
 idea
 of


the
 time
 frame
 for
 rapid
 fire
 really


made
 sense.
 like
 that
 helps.


>> It
 just
 it
 just
 helps
 me
 understand
 like


what
 the
 logic
 is
 too.
 But
 um
 beans


supersedes


soy
 beans
 supersede
 QT
 apparently.


But
 um
 but
 yeah,


>> there
 you
 go.
 All right,
 Jason,
 thank


you
 so
 much.
 Again,
 there's
 Twitter
 and


>> we
 will
 see
 you
 next
 week.


>> Always
 fun.
 Adios.


>> Later.


All
 right,
 that
 is
 it
 from
 me.
 Thank


everybody
 for
 joining.
 Daily
 recap
 will


be
 out
 in
 about
 20
 minutes.
 So,
 if
 you


if
 you
 have
 not
 had
 enough
 of
 me
 yet,


you
 will
 get
 the
 daily
 recap.
 Dude,
 I
 am


getting
 tagged
 in
 this
 freaking
 Grinder


story,
 all
 across
 Twitter.


Shout
 out
 to
 Evan
 for
 literally
 tagging


me
 in
 this.
 I
 got
 it,
 guys.
 I
 got
 it.


Everyone
 thinks
 I'm
 the
 one
 who
 bought


out
 Grinder.


Everyone
 thinks
 I'm
 the
 one.


I
 get
 it.


But
 uh,
 no,
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 them
 out,
 but


it
 is
 hilarious.


It
 It
 is
 hilarious.
 All right,
 so
 daily


recap
 will
 be
 out
 in
 a
 bit.
 Now,
 I


recorded
 the
 daily
 recap
 before
 this


soybean
 thing
 came
 out.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 all
 the
 information
 there
 is
 still


pretty
 important
 and
 analyzes
 what's


happened,
 but
 obviously
 the
 soybean


thing
 kind
 of
 changed
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 day.
 Now,
 again,
 it
 didn't
 really


tank
 the
 market.
 It
 just
 stopped
 like
 a


really
 green
 close
 tomorrow.
 I
 think


we'll
 see
 how
 much
 the
 market
 cares


about
 the
 soybean
 stuff,
 how
 much
 it


escalates.
 But
 hopefully,
 it's
 just


Trump
 saying
 something
 before
 the


meeting
 so
 he
 can
 negotiate
 versus
 it


being
 a
 massive
 escalation.
 Is
 Steve


live?
 Is
 Steve
 still
 live?


Let
 me
 see.
 Yeah,
 we
 can
 we
 can
 spam


Steve
 stream.
 If
 he's
 been
 live
 for
 a


while,
 he
 might
 be
 close
 to
 ending
 it,


but
 we
 can
 spam
 it
 near
 the
 end.


Um,
 let
 me
 see
 right
 here.


Steve
 is


is
 he
 live?


I
 mean,
 I
 know
 he's
 live.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 he's
 still
 live.
 He
 is.
 No,
 he
 just


finished.
 Oh,
 no.
 He's
 live.
 He's
 live.


He's
 live.
 Okay,
 cool.
 All right.


What
 do
 we
 do?
 Do
 we
 do
 We
 could
 do
 CRN


or
 We
 did
 CRN
 last
 time.
 What
 do
 we
 do,


bro?
 Look
 at
 this
 guy.
 He's
 talking


about

 Of
 course
 he
 is.
 He's


getting
 a
 question
 about
 cookies.

 And
 that's


Steve's
 face.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Of
 course,


he's
 looking
 to
 the
 sky
 trying
 to
 get


inspiration
 on
 how
 to
 answer
 this


question.
 This
 is
 hilarious.


Oh,
 wow.


Oh,
 wow.
 Um,


he's
 thinking
 so
 hard.


>> That's
 a
 hard
 one.


That's
 a
 really
 hard
 one
 because
 I
 mean,


>> bro,


>> rainbow
 cookies
 are
 amazing.
 Can
 oli
 are


amazing.
 Canoli
 are
 a
 little
 better
 when


you
 have
 coffee
 with
 it.


Why
 do
 I
 have
 to
 choose?
 Why
 can't
 I


just
 have
 both?
 Why
 can't
 I
 just
 have


both?
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 choose.
 Not


choose.


>> Bro,
 he
 took
 it
 so
 seriously.
 Look
 at


this.


>> Wow.


>> He
 couldn't
 believe
 the
 question.


>> Oh
 wow.


Oh
 wow.
 Um,


>> did
 he
 closed
 his
 eyes?
 He's
 like


>> That's
 a
 hard
 one.


>> He
 looked
 to
 the
 sky.


>> That's
 a
 really
 hard
 one
 because
 I
 mean


that's
 hilarious.
 Okay,

 do
 we
 spam?


What
 do
 we
 spam

 the
 chat?

 about
 that
 question.

 that


question.
