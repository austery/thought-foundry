Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicola
 Tangen,
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund


and
 today
 I'm
 in
 Paris
 and
 thrilled
 to


be
 joined
 by
 Katherine
 McGregor,
 the
 CEO


of
 Angie,
 one
 of
 Europe's
 energy
 giants.


Now
 Katherine's
 journey
 is
 incredible


working
 on
 oil
 rigs
 in
 Congo
 uh
 to


running
 one
 of
 France's
 top
 companies.


Uh
 Katherine
 took
 over
 NG
 just
 when


COVID
 struck
 and
 they
 then
 faced


Europe's
 biggest
 energy
 crisis
 in


decades
 when
 Russia
 turned
 off
 the
 gas.


So,
 uh,
 you
 have
 basically
 been
 through


a
 lot
 of
 interesting
 things.
 So,
 great


to
 have
 you
 here,
 Katherine.
 Thank
 you


very
 much,
 Nikolai.
 Great,
 great
 to
 be


here.
 Wonderful.
 What
 is
 NG?
 NG
 is
 a,


um,
 very
 large
 energy
 player
 that
 is


super
 committed
 to
 the
 energy


transition.
 It
 has
 a
 a
 very
 long
 history


uh
 about
 150
 years
 long.
 um
 coming
 from


uh
 Gaza
 France
 Sue
 also
 a
 little
 bit
 of


British
 stuff
 with
 international
 power


and
 also
 some
 Belgium
 uh
 DNA
 uh
 in
 the


company
 but
 we
 are
 now
 really
 a
 very


large
 utility
 we
 are
 present
 across
 the


whole
 value
 chain
 of
 energy
 uh
 and
 if


I'm
 to
 simplify
 NG
 we
 are
 present
 in
 the


production
 of
 electricity
 we
 have


customers
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 spectrum.
 We


have
 uh
 resident
 customers,
 we
 have


industrial,
 we
 have
 city
 and
 in
 the


middle
 really
 important
 part
 is
 the


infrastructure
 which
 transport,
 store,


distribute
 energy.
 So
 we
 are
 the


traditionally
 we
 are
 the
 infrastructure


operator
 of
 gas
 in
 France
 but
 we
 are


also
 present
 in
 power
 and
 so
 10
 and
 so


10
 years
 from
 now
 how
 in
 rough
 terms
 how


will
 the
 company
 look
 different?
 So
 we


are
 going
 to
 be
 different
 in
 the
 sense


that
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 electrify
 our


company.
 So
 you
 know
 when
 when
 I
 talked


about
 the
 production
 profile
 of
 NG
 we're


producing
 about
 100
 gawatt
 already
 of


power.
 Tell
 me
 100
 g
 what
 is
 100
 g


exactly
 good
 question
 Nikolai
 because
 in


NG
 we
 always
 talk
 about
 megawatt
 and


gigawatt.
 So
 100
 gawatt
 you
 have
 to


think
 one
 gawatt
 is
 on
 average
 a
 nuclear


reactor.
 So
 it's
 it's
 quite
 a
 lot
 and


50%
 of
 that
 today
 is
 from
 renewables.


So
 where
 we
 want
 to
 be
 in
 2030
 say
 to


your
 questions
 give
 some
 perspective
 we


will
 be
 at
 95
 gawatt
 on
 renewables
 and


battery.
 So
 we'll
 continue
 to
 develop
 a


generation
 capability
 in
 renewables
 and


this
 is
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 big
 thing


that
 we're
 doing
 with
 the
 energy


transition.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 we


would
 change
 is
 on
 that
 middle
 part


which
 I
 talked
 about
 which
 is
 the


infrastructure
 because
 we
 want
 to
 grow


this
 infrastructure
 piece
 at
 NG.
 We
 will


develop
 in
 power
 networks
 as
 and
 I'm


sure
 we'll
 talk
 about
 electrification
 as


you
 know
 an
 important
 dynamic
 in
 the


market.
 We
 want
 to
 continue
 to
 develop


our
 presence
 in
 infrastructure
 through


the
 development
 of
 our
 power
 networks.


And
 if
 I
 look
 at
 the
 customer
 part
 where


we
 want
 to
 do
 is
 selling
 even
 more
 power


than
 we
 do
 today
 to
 our
 customers.
 And


hopefully
 we
 can
 sell
 them
 our
 growl


which
 is
 a
 247
 product
 which
 is


renewable
 power
 at
 any
 time.
 So
 um
 let's


let's
 go
 back
 uh
 a
 few
 years.
 So
 you
 had


just
 become
 the
 CEO
 uh
 of
 what
 is
 uh
 uh


you
 know
 this
 incredible
 company
 and


then
 bang
 Russia
 cuts
 off
 the
 gas
 supply


to
 Europe
 or
 we
 cut
 them
 off.
 Um
 just
 um


how
 did
 you
 experience
 that?
 Yeah
 I
 have


to
 say
 it
 was
 one
 year
 in
 the
 job.
 Yeah.


So
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 uh
 several
 aspects


security
 of
 supply.
 Yeah.
 For
 Europe,


for
 our
 country
 and
 of
 course
 as
 NG
 for


customers
 that
 was
 a
 a
 big
 stream.
 There


was
 also
 a
 financial
 exposure
 for
 the


group
 as
 obviously
 we
 had
 commitment


with
 customers.
 We
 had
 long-term


commitment
 backed
 up
 by
 long-term


contract.
 So
 when
 suddenly
 you
 have
 risk


on
 the
 delivery
 on
 this
 long-term


contract
 on
 the
 supply
 side,
 then
 you


don't
 know
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


honor
 your
 commitment
 to
 your
 customers


which
 translates
 into
 potentially


financial
 exposure.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 a
 big


thing.
 And
 then
 yeah
 was
 another
 theme


if
 you
 like
 which
 was
 all
 around


affordability


uh
 managing
 the
 price
 escalation.
 you


know
 it
 was
 time
 10
 in
 some
 cases
 even


in
 certain
 sport
 market
 it
 was
 time
 100


on
 the
 power
 side
 or
 the
 gas
 side.
 So


how
 do
 we
 manage
 the
 affordability
 for


our
 customers
 and
 of
 course
 working
 with


the
 government
 to
 try
 and
 make
 sure
 that


the
 measures
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 take


eugen
 measures
 you
 know
 we
 are
 not
 going


to
 have
 unintended
 consequences
 that


would
 have
 more
 dramatic
 effect
 than


actually
 trying
 to
 fix
 the
 problems
 they


were
 trying
 so
 dimensions
 this
 was
 the


perfect
 nightmare
 right
 it
 was
 the


perfect
 nightmares
 now
 you
 know
 looking


back
 um
 I
 think
 there
 was
 the
 sense
 of


of
 urgency
 there
 was
 the
 sense
 of


collaboration.
 There
 was
 the
 sense
 of


trying
 and
 do
 the
 right
 thing.
 And
 all


this
 I
 think
 eventually
 paid
 um
 paid


results.
 Um
 you
 know
 Europe
 was


depending
 on
 Russian
 gas
 by
 40%
 for


zero.
 Um
 and
 indeed
 we
 had
 to
 find
 you


know
 new
 suppliers
 and
 make
 sure
 we
 had


enough
 gas
 for
 the
 next
 winter.
 Um
 maybe


two
 things
 that
 um
 I
 remember
 as
 as
 a
 as


a
 CEO.
 One
 was
 really
 to
 make
 sure
 that


my
 team
 could
 tell
 me
 at
 any
 given
 time


the
 exposure
 we
 had,
 financial
 exposure,


the
 risk
 on
 supply
 and
 that
 took
 a
 lot


of
 getting
 people
 together
 and
 and
 a
 lot


of
 teamwork.
 You
 know,
 people
 having
 to


go
 out
 of
 their
 swim
 lane,
 which
 is,
 you


know,
 often
 when
 you
 manage
 crisis,


people
 have
 to
 go
 beyond
 their
 normal


job
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 look
 at
 the


interfaces
 and
 the
 spaces
 that
 are
 not


necessarily
 attended.
 that
 was
 very
 much


necessary
 to
 understand
 both
 supply


security
 but
 also
 financial
 exposure
 for


the
 group.
 So
 then
 we
 could
 we
 were
 able


to
 communicate
 to
 our
 investors
 which


were
 you
 know
 quite
 worried
 about
 what


that
 meant
 for
 a
 group
 like
 NG
 to


suddenly
 have
 these
 big
 risks.
 So
 but


going
 on
 but
 I
 mean
 what
 do
 you
 you
 got


24
 million
 customers
 across
 30
 countries


and
 suddenly
 you
 have
 no
 gas.
 So
 so
 what


fortunately
 it
 it
 didn't
 happen


overnight.
 So
 we
 we
 were
 given
 a
 bit
 of


time.
 So
 what
 we
 do
 is
 that
 you
 make


sure
 you
 take
 advantage
 of
 this
 time
 to


actually
 work
 with
 your
 other
 suppliers


um
 to
 actually
 secure
 more
 supply
 so


that
 when
 eventually
 you
 don't
 have
 this


Russian
 gas
 coming,
 you
 have
 found


alternatives
 and
 you
 use
 spot,
 you
 use


LNG,
 you
 use
 other
 suppliers.
 Norway
 was


actually
 already
 a
 supplier
 for
 ours
 and


you
 know
 we
 managed
 to
 secure
 a
 bit
 more


from
 Norway
 as
 well.
 So
 that's
 really


you
 know
 managing
 and
 working
 with
 your


suppliers.
 So
 relationship
 with


suppliers
 is
 really
 important
 and
 also


very
 important
 it's
 managing
 the
 time


managing
 the
 time
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 um


you
 anticipate
 you
 know
 when
 actually


the
 delivery
 will
 stop
 that
 you
 are


ready
 for
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


know
 that
 at
 NG
 we
 were
 depending
 on


Russian
 gas
 for
 20%
 only
 of
 our
 supply.


So
 20%
 is
 a
 lot
 but
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 as


what
 was
 the
 exposure
 for
 Europe.
 20%


but
 we
 managed
 to
 find
 you
 know
 the


other
 suppliers.
 Are
 you
 surprised
 by
 by


how
 Europe
 managed
 to
 cope
 with
 that


crisis?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 positively


surprised
 I
 think
 in
 general
 I
 think


there
 was
 a
 sense
 of
 you
 know
 yeah
 sense


of
 urgency
 was
 there
 and
 I
 think
 you


know
 eventually
 we
 we
 went
 by
 and
 we


took
 a
 lot
 of
 actions
 collectively.
 I


think
 the
 effort
 on
 on
 storage
 you
 know


some
 countries
 didn't
 have
 for example
 a


minimum
 storage
 requirement
 ahead
 of
 the


winter
 and
 you
 know
 we
 realized
 that
 it


was
 actually
 quite
 important
 to
 make


sure
 that
 ahead
 of
 every
 winter
 the


storage
 had
 a
 minimum
 uh
 refilling.


Maybe
 there
 was
 another
 defining
 moment


where
 in
 France
 the
 three
 CEOs
 of
 the


big
 energy
 companies
 wrote
 a
 piece
 to


tell
 the
 citizens,
 the
 French
 people


that
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 was
 still


spring
 and
 there
 was
 not
 really
 any


impact
 on
 energy
 yet
 that
 we
 needed
 to


make
 sure
 that
 energy
 efficiency


measures
 were
 taken
 seriously
 and


implemented.
 And
 I
 remember
 that
 this


little
 piece
 with
 the
 three
 competitors


talking
 with
 one
 voice
 saying
 guys
 you


know
 we
 need
 to
 save
 energy
 had
 a
 big


impact
 and
 I
 think
 for
 me
 it
 was
 a
 big


lesson
 to
 show
 that
 you
 know
 business


they
 have
 a
 role
 to
 play
 to
 impact


positively
 behaviors
 when
 things
 get


serious
 because
 we
 were
 really
 heard
 and


listened
 to
 and
 that
 eventually
 you
 know


turned
 into
 actually
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 the


demand
 you
 know
 being
 tempered
 and
 I


think
 contributed
 to
 to
 the
 fact
 that


that
 indeed
 we
 we
 went
 through
 this


crisis
 in
 in
 relatively
 u
 my
 my
 terms
 if


yes
 so
 that
 was
 important
 let's
 talk


about
 your
 unique
 approach
 to
 the
 energy


transition
 you
 talk
 about
 molecule
 and


the
 electron
 what
 what
 does
 this
 mean
 in


simple
 terms
 it
 means
 that
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 way
 Europe
 wants
 to
 decarbonize


and
 to
 get
 to
 carbon
 neutrality
 by
 2050


electrification
 is
 a
 very
 important


lever
 uh
 electrification
 means
 going


from
 since
 16
 18%
 of
 electricity
 in
 the


final
 energy
 mix
 to
 50%.


So
 that's
 what
 he
 means
 by


electrification.
 So
 that's
 for
 instance


electric
 cars.
 Exactly.
 And
 so
 on.


Exactly.
 What
 that
 means
 though
 is
 that


50%
 of
 the
 final
 energy
 mix
 by
 2050
 will


not
 be
 electrify.
 And
 therefore
 we
 need


to
 find
 solution
 to
 decarbonize.
 And
 a


big
 chunk
 of
 this
 50%
 is
 the
 molecules.


Today,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 natural
 gas.
 It


can
 be
 heat.
 But
 it
 is
 true
 that
 we
 have


this
 view
 at
 NG
 that
 you're
 not
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 do
 everything
 through


electricity.
 It
 will
 be
 a
 very
 important


level
 to
 decarbonize.
 But
 we
 need
 to


tackle
 the
 challenge
 of
 decarbonization


of
 the
 molecule.
 And
 we
 use
 the
 S


because
 we
 say
 natural
 gas,
 which
 is


CH4,
 you
 know,
 we
 be
 part
 of
 the


solution.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 find
 ways
 to


replace
 natural
 gas
 with
 low
 carbon
 CH4.


So
 one
 for
 one.
 But
 we
 also
 then
 need
 to


work
 on
 hydrogen
 its
 derivative
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 have
 the
 right
 green


molecule
 for
 the
 right
 application.
 What


are
 tell
 me
 what
 are
 green
 gases?
 What


are
 green
 molecules?
 So
 green
 molecules


they
 are
 today
 biomethane
 which
 is
 the


same
 molecule
 as
 CH4
 but
 produced
 from


waste.
 And
 because
 it's
 existing
 waste,


it
 doesn't
 add
 CO2,
 which
 is
 why
 we
 say


we
 say
 the
 the
 regulation
 recognize
 this


gas
 as
 green.
 So
 the
 very
 nice
 thing
 is


that
 once
 you
 produce
 it,
 it's
 exactly


the
 same
 usage
 as
 today.
 So
 you
 can


really
 replace
 it
 without
 investment.


And
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 hydrogen


and
 derivative
 of
 molecules
 of
 hydrogen.


And
 it
 can
 be
 eiam
 ammoniac,
 it
 can
 be


ethanol,
 it
 can
 be
 also
 emethane.
 uh
 and


of
 course
 every
 time
 you
 transform
 all


these
 molecules
 it
 adds
 cost
 and


obviously
 it
 reduces
 your
 efficiency.
 So


you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 economic


of
 all
 this
 works
 which
 is
 why
 maybe
 a


simple
 statement
 Nikolai
 would
 be
 to
 say


that


today
 we
 think
 we
 have
 it
 to
 decarbonize


the
 electron.
 We
 know
 how
 to
 do
 that
 in


a
 fairly
 competitive
 manner.


Decarbonizing
 the
 molecule
 is
 a
 bit
 more


challenging
 and
 we
 need
 to
 tackle
 this


challenge
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 all
 works


out
 by
 2050.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 bit


more
 time,
 but
 it's
 definitely
 a
 very


very
 important
 aspect
 of
 decarbonation


and
 we
 are
 working
 through
 it.
 Why
 will


it
 take
 more
 time
 than
 you
 thought?
 It


takes
 a
 bit
 more
 time
 because
 we
 can
 see


hydrogen
 it's
 a
 bit
 more
 expensive.
 You


see
 the
 regulation
 is
 not
 very
 mature.


It
 also
 means
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 industrials


customers
 that
 they
 need
 to
 first
 invest


in
 the
 transformation
 of
 their
 process


and
 then
 pay
 the
 hydrogen
 which
 today
 is


a
 little
 bit
 more
 expensive
 when
 it's


green
 or
 low
 carbon
 than
 the
 gray


hydrogen.
 So
 you
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 double


whammy
 when
 you
 have
 to
 have
 first
 capex


and
 then
 OPEX
 incremental
 cost.
 we
 need


to
 accompany
 the
 industries
 uh
 to
 help


them
 to
 assist
 them
 uh
 in
 these
 both
 in


both
 of
 these
 efforts
 if
 you
 like.
 So
 we


can
 see
 that
 it
 takes
 a
 bit
 more
 time.


But
 if
 you
 if
 you
 were
 to
 rank
 if
 you


were
 to
 rank
 the
 challenges
 in
 this


transformation
 what
 would
 be
 what
 would


be
 the
 most
 problematic
 things
 or
 the


most
 difficult
 things?
 I
 would
 say


simplification
 of
 regulation
 is
 a
 big


thing.
 Um
 industrialization


of
 the
 equipment.
 So
 for
 example,
 in
 the


case
 of
 hydrogen
 production,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 uh
 electrolyers
 that
 need


to
 work
 at
 larger
 scale
 that
 needs
 to
 be


a
 bit
 more
 economical.
 This
 for
 me
 is


more
 of
 a
 matter
 of
 time.
 It's
 really
 to


me
 is
 not
 so
 much
 a
 technical
 challenge.


It's
 just
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 bit
 more


time.
 And
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 challenges


had
 on
 the
 decarbonation
 of
 the


molecule,
 I
 think
 think
 of
 20
 years
 ago,


did
 we
 really
 think
 that
 we
 would
 be


where
 we
 are
 on
 renewables?
 When
 you


look
 at
 the
 price
 of
 solar
 panels,
 uh


20%,
 I
 mean
 it
 20x
 decrease
 in
 panel


cost.
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 totally


spectacular
 what
 we
 have
 achieved.
 When


I
 look
 at
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 on
 the


molecules,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 looking
 in


the
 next
 20
 years,
 I'm
 quite
 confident


we
 will
 manage
 to
 overcome
 these


challenges.
 It's
 just
 a
 bit
 more
 taking


a
 bit
 more
 time
 than
 maybe
 what
 we've


done
 on
 the
 power
 side.
 Why
 um
 given


that
 all
 the
 governments
 are
 keen
 to


have
 this
 transition?
 Why
 why
 are


regulations
 difficult?
 Regulations
 are


diff
 are
 difficult
 in
 Europe.
 Um


because
 sometimes
 we're
 trying
 to
 be
 um


we're
 trying
 to
 be
 too
 perfect.
 We're


trying
 to
 solve
 too
 many
 things
 at
 the


same
 time.
 Um
 I
 think
 maybe
 also
 a


misunderstanding
 of
 of
 the
 reality
 of


industry.
 Um
 it's
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to


to
 ask
 for
 a
 hydrogen
 molecule
 for


example


um
 to
 be
 produced
 with
 a
 electrolyer


uh
 additional
 uh
 solar
 project
 or
 wind


project
 um
 and
 everything
 needs
 to
 be


perfect
 for
 this
 hydrogen
 to
 qualify
 to


be
 a
 green
 molecule.
 I
 think
 it's
 we


just
 have
 to
 first
 make
 sure
 that
 the


market
 emerges
 and
 therefore
 in
 my
 mind


uh
 remain
 technology
 neutral.
 So
 what


that
 means
 is
 that
 we
 will
 take
 any


lowcarbon
 hydrogen
 molecule
 that
 can
 be


produced
 whether
 it
 is
 still
 from


natural
 gas
 but
 you
 capture
 the
 CO2


whether
 it's
 from
 nuclear
 power
 whether


whether
 it's
 from
 renewable
 power
 and


that
 will
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 kick
 in
 the


market
 um
 and
 then
 eventually
 if
 you


want
 to
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 strict
 on
 what


makes
 up
 really
 this
 renewable
 hydrogen


you
 can
 over
 time
 but
 I
 think
 initially


you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 market


emerge
 you
 the
 volume
 uh
 you
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 have
 the
 infrastructure.
 So
 you


know
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 need


to
 fall
 into
 piece
 and
 sometimes
 the


regulation
 is
 just
 trying
 to
 be
 too


strict
 too
 early
 not
 matching
 the


maturity
 of
 the
 technology.
 This
 is
 a


bit
 more
 expensive
 than
 other
 sources
 of


uh
 energy.
 Now
 we
 saw
 recently
 that


Arcelon
 Metal
 is
 cancelling
 green


hydrogen
 projects
 in
 Europe
 and
 so
 what


type
 of
 setbacks
 are
 we
 seeing
 now
 in


this
 transition?
 I
 I
 I
 think
 first
 of


all
 you
 you
 you
 have
 a
 you
 know
 the
 the


topic
 of
 um
 the
 the
 industry
 health
 in


Europe
 is
 is
 is
 really
 a
 a
 critical


topic.
 We
 do
 not
 want
 to
 have
 energy


transition
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 industry.


Um
 and
 hopefully
 the
 new
 commission
 uh


is
 working
 through
 its
 you
 know
 number


of
 um
 omnibus
 and
 simplification


initiative.
 it
 has
 taken
 the
 measure
 of


this
 problem
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 as
 Mal


is
 illustrating
 what
 could
 happen
 if
 we


don't
 take
 that
 topic
 seriously
 we
 want


to
 be
 able
 to
 decarbonize
 and
 keep
 the


industry
 with
 us
 that's
 very
 very


important
 now
 you
 are
 putting
 a
 lot
 of


money
 into
 this
 is
 it
 25
 billion
 uh
 for


the
 next
 three
 years
 year
 for
 the
 next


three
 years
 on
 gross
 capex
 yeah
 now
 when


you
 make
 those
 type
 of
 investments
 how


do
 you
 anchor
 those
 decisions
 who
 are


involved
 in
 that
 process.
 Obviously,
 we


have
 a
 a
 very
 clear
 strategy
 on
 how
 we


want
 to
 deploy
 our
 capital.
 Uh
 we
 have


these
 22
 to
 24
 uh
 billion
 euros
 plans


over
 3
 years.
 We
 have
 clear
 priorities


uh
 renewables
 uh
 so
 wind,
 solar,


batteries
 and
 we'll
 talk
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 the
 role
 of
 storage
 you
 know
 in
 the


energy
 transition
 is
 really
 really


important.
 We
 want
 to
 develop
 also
 in


power
 networks.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 capital


allocation
 which
 is
 based
 on


geographical
 focus.
 90%
 of
 our
 capex
 is


going
 to
 be
 spent
 on
 10
 countries
 for


example.
 Um
 the
 priorities
 I've
 laid
 out


uh
 which
 by
 the
 way
 makes
 this
 capex
 for


85%
 of
 which
 of
 it
 aligned
 with
 the


European
 taxonomy.
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


big
 word
 but
 it's
 really
 important
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 are
 deploying
 our


capex
 indeed
 in
 true
 support
 of
 the


energy
 transition
 and
 for
 sure
 value


creation
 is
 critical.
 Um
 we
 we
 do
 not


want
 at
 NG
 to
 get
 to
 our
 net
 zero
 goal


in
 2045
 and
 to
 deploy
 this
 capex
 and
 to


get
 to
 our
 95
 gawatt
 targets
 by


destroying
 value.
 So
 value
 creation
 is


very
 very
 important.
 uh
 and
 so
 project


by
 project
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 deliver


enough
 value
 and
 typically
 it's
 200
 bips


over
 whack
 typically
 on
 average
 so
 it's


not
 you
 know
 crazy
 amounts
 but
 we
 want


for
 each
 project
 to
 deliver
 its
 value


and
 the
 other
 aspect
 that
 I
 will
 mention


which
 is
 what's
 important
 for
 NG
 is


value
 creation
 it's
 also
 really


important
 for
 us
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


projects
 that
 we
 deploy
 bring
 something


to
 to
 the
 energy
 system.
 That's
 why
 we


talk
 about
 the
 smart
 electrons.
 We
 don't


want
 to
 for
 example
 just
 deploy
 dumb


solar
 projects
 if
 they
 are
 already
 in
 a


region
 too
 many
 solar
 projects
 because


then
 you
 add
 to
 the
 problem
 of
 you
 know


negative
 price
 hours
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 day
 when
 actually
 what
 you
 need
 is


electrons
 that
 are
 produced
 when
 people


need
 this
 electrons.
 So
 we
 work
 a
 lot
 at


NG
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 project
 that
 we


develop
 on
 the
 renewable
 side
 are


accretive
 to
 the
 system
 and
 are
 going
 to


bring
 you
 know
 real
 value
 to
 the
 system.


That's
 also
 a
 way
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it


will
 resist
 the
 test
 of
 time
 because
 we


know
 that
 you
 know
 CFDs
 are
 very


important
 or
 contracts
 are
 very


important
 but
 you
 know
 they
 are
 10
 15


years
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 are


solid
 and
 bringing
 value
 to
 the
 to
 the


market
 and
 to
 the
 customers.
 That's
 very


very
 important.
 So
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


some
 of
 the
 criterias
 we
 have
 for
 uh


this
 capital
 allocation
 plan
 that
 we


have
 the
 22
 24.
 So
 focus
 selectivity


making
 sure
 that
 the
 project
 are
 worth


it
 you
 know
 adding
 something
 to
 the
 to


the
 system
 that's
 really
 important


that's
 some
 of
 the
 and
 of
 course


alignment
 with
 our
 strategy
 very
 very


important.
 Now
 what
 would
 it
 take
 to


increase
 connectivity
 across
 Europe
 for


instance
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 lack
 of
 uh
 uh


grid
 systems
 from
 north
 to
 south
 right


just
 what
 what
 type
 of
 challenges
 do
 we


have
 in
 Europe?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think


you're
 pointing
 to
 a


it's
 it's
 also
 an
 opportunity.
 Um
 you


know
 one
 one
 thing
 that
 Europe
 has
 is


that
 it
 has
 a
 fairly
 integrated
 energy


market
 uh
 an
 interconnected
 grid
 which


um
 makes
 it
 benefit
 from
 the
 diversity


of
 the
 production
 types
 that
 we
 have
 in


Europe.
 You
 know
 we
 can
 have
 a
 lot
 of


wind
 in
 the
 north
 of
 Europe.
 We
 can
 have


a
 lot
 of
 solar
 in
 southern
 Europe.
 We


can
 have
 nuclear
 power
 in
 the
 countries


that
 have
 made
 the
 choice
 of
 developing


nuclear
 power.
 And
 through
 connectivity,


you
 can
 make
 sure
 that
 indeed
 first
 you


have
 a
 resilient
 system
 and
 second


you're
 working
 to
 lower
 the
 overall
 cost


of
 the
 electrons
 as
 you
 are
 taking


advantage
 notably
 on
 the
 renewable
 side


of
 very
 very
 very
 low
 uh
 cost
 um
 uh


production
 means.
 So
 the
 interconnection


is
 indeed
 a
 very
 important
 aspect
 of


keeping
 the
 cost
 down
 of
 the
 keeping
 the


grid
 cost
 down
 but
 it
 does
 take


interconnections
 to
 be
 strengthened.
 Uh


you
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 too
 much
 because


that's
 very
 expensive.
 You
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 you
 do
 uh
 you
 develop
 and


deploy
 the
 interconnection
 just
 exactly


at
 the
 right
 place.
 You
 have
 to


complement
 it
 also
 with
 storage.
 So
 you


know
 battery
 is
 something
 that
 some


countries
 in
 Europe
 are
 a
 little
 bit


behind.
 Uh
 so
 countries
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 there
 are
 the
 right
 signals
 to


invest
 in
 batteries
 because
 batteries


are
 often
 a
 way
 also
 to
 deal
 with
 um


grid
 bottlenecks
 by
 making
 sure
 that
 you


know
 you
 can
 smooth
 um
 the
 the
 the
 fl


the
 the
 the
 stream
 of
 electrons
 uh


depending
 of
 the
 time
 to
 make
 sure
 that


you
 don't
 necessarily
 over
 spend
 on
 your


grid.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 ramp
 up


these
 storage
 and
 flexible
 solutions?


Capacity
 remuneration
 mechanism.
 It's
 a


sorry
 it's
 a
 tech
 technical
 term
 but


what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 there
 are
 um


schemes
 that
 country
 and
 regulator


organize
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 an
 investor


gets
 reminerated
 for
 having
 spare


capacity.
 That's
 what
 we
 mean
 by
 CRM.


They
 are
 very
 important
 because
 they


allow
 for
 certain
 type
 of
 production.
 It


can
 be
 spinning
 machines
 or
 it
 can
 be


batteries
 that
 are
 reminerated
 for
 the


for
 just
 for
 their
 existence
 and
 then


they
 are
 called
 upon
 to
 bring
 services


to
 the
 networks.
 Um
 and
 batteries


often
 need
 to
 have
 this
 type
 of


remineration
 mechanism
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be


invested
 upon
 to
 be
 investable
 and
 and


as
 you
 ask
 us
 you
 know
 what
 is
 uh
 the


rules
 and
 the
 what
 do
 we
 need
 to
 deploy


a
 capital
 often
 on
 battery
 project
 we


are
 going
 to
 need
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


capacity
 remuneration
 mechanism
 because


it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 invest
 in
 a


battery
 project
 based
 only
 on
 merchant


remuneration.


You
 know,
 NG
 we
 are
 a
 utility.
 Our
 risk


appetite
 is
 not
 very
 high.
 We
 like
 to
 be


able
 to
 secure
 every
 investment
 with


some
 sort
 of
 uh
 income
 whether
 it's
 a


PPA
 with
 the
 customers,
 whether
 it's
 a


contract
 with
 a
 government
 or
 regulator


or
 whether
 it's
 through
 this
 capacity


remuneration
 mechanism
 and
 they
 are
 very


important
 part
 of
 the
 toolbox
 of
 the


market
 design
 that
 Europe
 has
 decided.


So
 they
 now
 exist
 and
 they
 are
 really


really
 important
 for
 you
 know
 Spain
 and


Germany
 and
 all
 and
 France
 to
 be
 able
 to


develop
 more
 battery
 energy
 storage


which
 are
 a
 critical
 part
 of
 the
 energy


system.
 Talking
 about
 risks
 and
 talking


about
 Spain
 so
 we
 had
 a
 big
 outage


um
 how
 could
 that
 have
 been
 prevented?


Look,
 I
 I
 think
 uh
 obviously
 the
 the
 I


mean
 people
 claim
 that's
 because
 of
 a


high
 proportion
 of
 renewable


energy
 supply.
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 to
 objectivize
 all
 this.
 Um


there
 was
 uh
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 renewables


working
 in
 Spain
 at
 the
 time
 of
 the


blackout,
 but
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of


renewables
 working
 in
 Spain
 in
 days
 and


weeks
 before
 and
 there
 was
 no
 blackout.


Yeah.
 Um
 so
 I
 I'm
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 I


won't
 want
 to
 to
 preempt
 the
 full


conclusion
 of
 the
 report.
 What
 is
 really


important
 in
 the
 systems
 that
 we
 are


developing
 which
 are
 more
 and
 more


complex
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have


enough
 stabilization
 means
 uh
 to
 be
 able


to
 be
 mobilized
 in
 the
 network.
 What


that
 means
 is
 that
 you
 have
 certain


types
 of
 production
 and
 it
 can
 be
 uh
 gas


gas
 plants,
 it
 can
 be
 hydro
 assets,
 it


can
 be
 nuclear
 reactors,
 it
 can
 be


batteries
 when
 they
 are
 well
 uh


configurated,
 well
 programmed
 that
 will


provide
 these
 services
 to
 the
 network


which
 stabilizes
 frequency
 of
 voltage


imbalance
 which
 are
 very
 frequent
 in
 any


networks.
 renewables
 are
 a
 little
 bit


less
 able
 to
 do
 that
 especially
 solar.


So
 the
 point
 is
 you
 need
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you
 have
 enough
 of
 these
 different


types
 of
 production
 that
 can
 bring
 this


type
 of
 services
 to
 the
 network
 that's
 I


think
 will
 be
 something
 that
 will
 need


to
 be
 reasserted.
 Basically
 if
 I'm


simplify
 the
 role
 of
 flexibility
 the


role
 of
 flexibility
 is
 very
 very


important
 and
 for
 that
 you
 need
 to
 make


sure
 that
 indeed
 you
 have
 enough
 of


these
 flexible
 assets
 in
 your
 production


uh
 portfolio
 and
 for
 that
 you
 need
 to


have
 the
 right
 um
 regulation
 mechanism


such
 as
 the
 capacity
 remuneration


mechanism
 that
 I
 talked
 about.
 So
 that's


maybe
 one
 aspect.
 Maybe
 the
 second


aspect
 is
 the
 grid
 and
 making
 sure
 that


indeed
 you
 know
 the
 interconnections
 are


sufficient.
 Um
 and
 of
 course


interconnection
 being
 between
 two


countries
 uh
 you
 have
 the
 complexity
 of


making
 sure
 that
 you
 know
 the
 two


country
 get
 along
 agree
 remuneration


etc.
 Now
 investments
 in
 the
 energy


system
 is
 extremely
 expensive
 right
 and


we're
 now
 seeing
 for
 instance
 in
 uh
 in


the
 UK
 you
 have
 uh
 private
 credit
 coming


in
 to
 invest
 in
 the
 nuclear
 uh
 energy


generation
 assets
 right
 or
 just
 what's


the
 role
 of
 um
 private
 investments
 in


this
 system
 I
 mean
 private
 in
 investment


in
 general
 is
 is
 very
 very
 uh
 obviously


very
 very
 important
 because
 you're
 right


to
 say
 you
 know
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


capital
 needed
 to
 conduct
 this
 energy


transition.
 Uh
 so
 very
 very
 important.


Um
 what
 I'd
 say
 is
 that
 in
 order
 for


this
 capital
 to
 be
 interested
 in


investing
 in
 the
 energy
 transition
 that


is
 true
 for
 NG,
 you
 need
 stability.
 Uh


you
 need
 fair
 remuneration
 and
 by


remuneration
 I
 mean
 riskreward
 you
 know


matching
 very
 very
 obviously
 very
 um


important.
 Um
 you
 need
 the
 the
 direction


to
 be
 set
 once
 for
 all.
 you
 need


regulations
 that
 um
 um
 are
 you
 know
 both


stable
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 remain


pragmatic
 which
 I
 know
 is
 easy
 to
 say


maybe
 not
 so
 easy
 to
 implement
 but
 I


think
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 private


capital
 building
 uh
 future
 proof


infrastructure
 for
 our
 economies


contributing
 to
 the
 well-being
 of
 our


citizens
 to
 the
 competitiveness
 of
 our


industries
 to
 the
 competitive
 advantage


of
 a
 continent
 like
 Europe
 you
 it
 is
 a


no-brainer
 when
 you
 think
 about
 it.
 And


by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 we
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 Europe.
 Look
 at
 what
 is
 happening


in
 China.
 China
 is
 deploying
 uh


renewable
 powers
 and
 decarbonizing


actually
 uh
 very
 fast
 and
 furious.
 Um


and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 Europe
 has
 to
 to


keep
 moving
 on
 this.
 M
 of
 course
 I
 have


to
 uh
 remind
 you
 Katherine
 that
 the


Norwegian
 sovereign
 wealth
 can
 also
 make


investments
 in
 renewable
 infrastructure


projects
 and
 so
 you
 know
 if
 you
 got
 some


uh
 some
 really
 really
 good
 ones
 we
 would


we
 would
 love
 to
 see
 them.
 Now
 uh
 AI
 and


the
 implications
 for
 energy
 uh
 supply


and
 demand
 what
 um
 how
 important
 is
 big


tech
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 driving


energy
 demand?
 So
 obviously
 really


important
 um
 data
 center
 you
 know
 AI


focused
 data
 center
 on
 average
 consumes


as
 much
 as
 about
 a
 a
 small
 city
 of


100,000
 people.
 Uh
 so
 you
 have
 obviously


um
 load
 implication.


Uh
 what
 I
 would
 like
 to
 emphasize
 is


that
 our
 tech
 customers
 um
 have
 been


fantastic
 in
 um
 helping
 moving
 the


needle
 really
 um
 on
 decarbonation
 on


being
 quite
 strict
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 they


want
 to
 have
 green
 power.
 Um
 they
 want


to
 actually
 contribute
 to
 the


development
 of
 additional


uh
 green
 power
 um
 capacity.
 Uh
 so
 we


develop
 a
 lot
 of
 projects
 uh
 with
 uh


tech
 companies
 as
 counterparty.
 We
 are


also
 working
 with
 some
 of
 them
 uh
 on
 our


projects
 which
 is
 famous
 24/7
 which


means
 that
 they
 don't
 just
 want
 to
 have


you
 know
 a
 renewable
 project
 and
 and


offset
 you
 know
 average
 volumes
 of


production
 versus
 an
 average


consumption.
 they
 are
 really
 trying
 to


matching
 to
 match
 the
 consumption
 that


they
 have
 on
 an
 hourly
 basis
 with


actually
 production
 which
 is
 much
 much


more
 difficult
 to
 do.
 Um
 and
 so
 they've


been
 moving
 the
 needle
 frankly
 and


raising
 the
 bar
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 um
 their


demand
 on
 decarbonation
 which
 I
 commend


and
 I
 I
 think
 by
 the
 way
 they
 they


should
 not
 give
 up.
 I
 think
 that's
 very


important
 that
 AI
 consumption
 comes
 with


you
 know
 additional
 productions
 with


green
 power
 that's
 really
 important


being
 mindful
 of
 the
 impact
 on
 for


example
 their
 development
 on
 potentially


potential
 affordability
 of
 power
 in
 the


region
 where
 they
 operate
 which
 is
 which


is
 why
 I
 think
 this
 dialogue
 is


extremely
 important.
 Do
 we
 have
 enough


energy
 to
 uh
 power
 all
 these
 new


centers?
 we
 will
 have
 as
 long
 as
 we


continue
 to
 work
 hand
 inhand
 with
 them


to
 make
 sure
 that
 their
 development


uh
 is
 accompanied
 with
 additional


renewable
 development
 and
 by
 doing
 so


they
 will
 themselves
 benefit
 from
 low


carbon
 power
 and
 then
 we
 will


collectively
 protect


uh
 the
 more
 you
 know
 residential


customers
 or
 nonAI
 or
 more
 you
 know
 in


traditional
 industrial
 customers
 from


price
 increase
 and
 and
 tension
 on
 the


power
 system.
 So
 they
 have
 a
 massive


role
 to
 play
 on
 the
 energy
 system.
 I


believe
 that
 they
 know
 that
 they
 have


this
 awareness
 and
 so
 we
 have
 to


continue
 to
 work
 hand
 in
 hand
 on
 that.
 I


think
 that's
 really
 important.
 Okay.
 So


let's
 move
 on
 to
 some
 of
 the
 the
 other


challenges
 we
 have.
 The
 drug
 report
 says


that
 Europe's
 energy
 costs
 are
 killing


our
 competitiveness
 and
 energy
 in
 many


cases
 are
 what
 is
 it
 like
 four
 or
 five


times
 uh
 more
 expensive
 in
 Europe
 than


in
 the
 US,
 right?
 So
 huge
 disadvantage.


So
 how
 are
 we
 going
 to
 get
 energy
 prices


down?
 So
 we
 we
 have
 to
 obviously
 work
 on


all
 aspect
 of
 the
 energy
 system.
 Uh


again
 you
 know
 renewable
 project
 can
 be


quite
 competitive.
 If
 they
 are
 developed


together
 with
 the
 other
 bricks
 that
 I


mentioned
 earlier.
 So
 you
 know
 if
 only


you
 do
 renewables
 but
 you
 don't
 work
 on


energy
 storage
 system
 you're
 going
 to


have
 a
 problem.
 If
 you
 don't
 work
 on


your
 grid
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


problem.
 So
 every
 of
 these
 component


needs
 to
 be
 developed
 and
 then


eventually
 we
 will
 have
 an
 affordable


system
 and
 it
 will
 be
 low
 carbon.
 It


will
 be
 competitive
 from
 all
 dimensions.


When
 when
 do
 you
 think
 that
 will
 be?


It's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 difficult
 question
 to


answer
 with
 with
 precision.
 It's
 going


to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time.
 But
 if
 you


look
 at
 for
 example
 Spanish
 prices,
 they


have
 come
 down
 very
 very
 very


significantly.
 when
 Spanish
 power
 price


today
 are
 very
 low.
 They
 are
 the
 lowest


in
 Europe
 and
 so
 you
 starting
 to
 see
 I


think
 you
 know
 in
 northern
 countries
 as


well
 where
 you
 have
 obviously
 you're


gifted
 with
 hydro
 but
 when
 you
 have


plenty
 of
 renewables
 in
 abundance
 you're


starting
 to
 see
 the
 impact
 on
 the
 power


prices.
 So
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 uh


France
 you
 know
 is
 also
 uh
 right
 now
 you


know
 at
 a
 fairly
 lower
 prices
 than
 in


other
 countries.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 convinced


that
 with
 sufficient
 renewables


development
 again
 well
 accompanied
 with


the
 right
 storage
 with
 the
 right
 grease


development
 for
 those
 company
 who
 have


nuclear
 that
 notably
 you
 know
 existing


nuclear
 that
 can
 be
 extended
 that
 also


contributes
 to
 low
 carbon
 electrons
 with


all
 this
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to


be
 able
 um
 to
 provide
 lower
 uh
 cost


power
 to
 our
 industrial
 customers
 and
 to


our
 customers
 In
 general,
 I
 think
 um
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 and
 you
 didn't
 ask
 me


so
 much
 about
 that,
 but
 there
 is
 also


the
 notion
 of
 sovereignty.
 Energy


transition
 is
 a
 lot
 about
 sovereignty.


Yeah.
 Electrons
 that
 are
 produced
 from


renewables
 are
 produced
 locally.
 Yeah.


So
 when
 will
 when
 will
 countries
 start


to
 think
 about
 Europe
 overall
 rather


than
 only
 the
 wrong
 country?


Um
 hopefully
 yesterday.


What
 will
 it
 take?
 I
 mean,
 will
 they


ever
 do?
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 do
 I
 do
 think
 on


the
 energy
 side,
 you
 know,
 the
 the


complimentarity
 that
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 the
 different
 profiles
 of


production,
 the
 ability
 to
 import,
 which


was
 tested
 during
 the
 energy
 crisis.


Remember
 the
 gas,
 it
 used
 to
 flow
 from


east
 to
 west
 in
 Europe
 and
 suddenly
 we


actually
 exported
 gas
 from
 west
 to
 east,


which
 showed
 the
 importance
 of
 the


connectivity
 of
 the
 infrastructure,
 the


energy
 infrastructure.
 And
 similarly
 on


power
 there
 is
 often
 you
 know
 import
 and


export
 of
 power
 from
 one
 country
 to


another.
 You
 never
 know
 which
 technology


can
 go
 through
 problems.
 You
 know


sometimes
 a
 nuclear
 powers
 in
 France
 can


have
 issues
 when
 it's
 super
 super
 hot
 in


France.
 You
 have
 to
 curtail
 a
 little
 bit


because
 you
 cannot
 cool
 anymore
 some
 of


the
 plants.
 So
 you
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 rely
 on
 each
 other.
 Tell
 me
 tell
 me


about
 technologies.
 So
 if
 you
 were
 to


rank
 them,
 you
 know,
 your
 favorites,


less
 favorites,
 you
 know,
 just
 how
 do


you
 rank
 renewable
 energy
 sources
 in


your
 mind?
 What
 is
 your
 to
 to
 be
 honest,


this
 is
 really
 a,
 you
 know,
 I
 am


actually
 advocating
 that
 you
 should


never
 oppose
 the
 lowcarbon
 technologies.


You
 need
 you
 frankly
 need
 all
 of
 them.


The
 low
 carbon
 technologies,
 you
 need


the
 mix
 because
 there
 is
 to
 to
 your


there
 is
 no
 perfect
 one.
 and
 and
 you


know
 I
 today
 you
 know
 there
 is


everybody's
 super
 bullish
 on
 nuclear
 and


nuclear
 can
 be
 great
 but
 there
 is
 topics


around
 the
 waste
 there
 is
 topic
 around


the
 cooling
 there
 is
 also
 the
 topic
 of


the
 cost
 of
 new
 nuclear
 so
 nuclear
 can


be
 part
 of
 the
 answer
 I
 don't
 think


nuclear
 can
 be
 all
 of
 the
 answers


renewables
 they
 are
 very
 cheap
 once


installed
 they
 have
 the
 intermittency
 so


you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have


enough
 battery
 you
 have
 enough
 energy


storage
 solution
 hydro
 is
 spectacul


But
 what
 happen
 if
 you
 have
 a
 jot?


So
 you
 know
 you
 really
 need
 to
 have
 a


combination
 of
 technology
 and
 I
 often


regret
 that
 sometimes
 people
 start
 to


fall
 in
 love
 with
 one
 technology
 and
 and


then
 you
 have
 this
 you
 know
 I'm
 anti
 so


I
 I
 honestly
 think
 it
 is
 not
 helpful
 at


all.
 Let's
 let's
 talk
 about
 one
 which


hasn't
 been
 really
 installed
 yet.
 Uh
 so


uh
 Norway
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 longest


coastlines
 in
 the
 world.
 it
 blows
 a
 lot,


you
 know,
 lots
 of
 wind,
 yet
 uh
 there
 is


no
 onshore
 wind.
 What
 are
 your


reflections
 about
 that?
 Um
 I
 think
 wind


is
 an
 incredible
 resource.
 Um
 in
 fact,
 I


visited
 one
 of
 our
 offshore
 uh
 wind


project
 yesterday
 in
 France.
 Um,
 you


know,
 from
 the
 decision
 to
 invest
 to


today
 where
 we
 have
 already
 10
 wind


farms
 spinning
 and
 injecting
 power


already.
 You
 know
 how
 long
 it
 took?
 Less


than
 two
 years.
 Wow.
 You
 see
 when
 people


think
 about
 nuclear
 you
 imagine
 in
 less


than
 two
 years
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be


putting
 this
 park
 in
 service
 in
 November


November
 this
 year
 that
 would
 be
 61


turbines
 500
 megawatt
 800,000
 people


that
 is
 wind
 that
 is
 wind
 for
 you
 now


when
 I
 say
 two
 years
 obviously
 I
 don't


tell
 you
 the
 whole
 thing
 in
 fact
 it
 has


been
 10
 years
 development
 this
 is


because
 of
 permits
 this
 is
 because
 of


the
 administration
 this
 is
 because
 of


you
 know
 making
 sure
 that
 you
 get
 the


fisherman
 happy
 etc.
 So
 those
 frankly


development
 time
 too
 long.
 Absolutely.


This
 is
 offshore
 which
 can
 be
 very


expensive.
 This
 is
 offshore
 which
 is
 the


offshore
 cost
 are
 reducing.
 This


technology
 is
 based
 on
 8
 megawatt


turbines.
 Today
 in
 Scotland
 we
 are


already
 doing
 15
 16
 megawatt
 per


turbine.
 So
 already
 you
 know
 you're


doubling
 the
 capacity
 of
 each
 wind
 farms


each
 wind
 turbines.
 So
 the
 cost
 of
 of
 of


offshore
 is
 becoming
 now
 today
 much
 much


more
 competitive.
 The
 resources
 are


incredible.
 The
 resources
 are


incredible.
 But
 any
 reflections
 on
 on


shore
 wind
 in
 Norway?
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 the


resources
 are
 incredible
 as
 well
 and
 I


think
 onshore
 wind
 has
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the


solution.
 The
 only
 thing
 of
 course
 is


that
 you
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 work
 with


the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 local
 constituents


and
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 acceptability


is
 where
 it
 should
 be
 that
 you
 know
 in


my
 experience
 and
 in
 France
 the
 project


where
 that
 you
 start
 developing
 very


early
 with
 a
 local
 population
 uh
 works


best.
 You
 also
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that


the
 people
 that
 are
 living
 around
 this


project
 benefit
 from
 the
 project
 and
 it


can
 be
 under
 the
 form
 of
 you
 know
 either


you
 know
 certain
 taxes
 or
 certain


benefit
 for
 their
 communities
 or
 even


sometimes
 a
 discount
 on
 the
 power
 price.


So
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 something
 in
 for


them.
 uh
 but
 what
 I'm
 you
 know
 maybe
 a
 a


small
 remark
 is
 that
 we
 have
 just
 did
 a


big
 poll
 in
 France
 on
 acceptability
 and


the
 opinion
 of
 French
 people
 of


renewable
 project
 and
 it
 was
 amazing


amazing
 84
 84%


of
 the
 French
 people
 have
 a
 positive


opinion
 of
 renewables
 and
 when
 you
 read


the
 press
 frankly
 you
 don't
 have
 that


feeling
 at
 all
 so
 what's
 very


interesting
 is
 that
 when
 you
 actually


ask
 the
 people
 they
 see
 renewables
 as


part
 of
 the
 solution.
 They
 see
 that
 it


is
 helping
 sovereignty.
 They
 see
 those


turbines
 spinning
 not
 needing
 any


imports
 of
 any
 kind
 once
 they've


installed
 and
 people
 now
 are
 seeing
 the


importance
 of
 renewables
 in
 the
 energy


mix
 of
 the
 future
 which
 is
 quite


remarkable.
 Beautiful.
 Now
 um
 solar


panels
 80%
 is
 now
 controlled
 by
 China.


Should
 Europe
 be
 worried
 about
 that?


Look,
 it's
 we
 we've
 seen
 in
 the
 past


that
 it's
 never
 good
 to
 be
 dependent
 on


on
 one
 supplier
 on
 one
 country.
 So
 you


diversification
 is
 important.
 Um
 we're


starting
 to
 supply
 uh
 and
 and
 and
 to


diversify
 our
 supply
 chain
 on
 on
 on


solars.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 Europe
 has
 to


look
 whether
 you
 we
 can
 relocize
 some
 of


this
 production.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 would


be
 fantastic.
 And
 then
 find
 the
 right


balance
 between
 you
 know
 the
 price
 of


the
 panel
 and
 the
 price
 of
 the
 power


that
 is
 produced
 from
 this
 project.
 So


you
 you
 know
 you
 need
 to
 find
 the
 right


balance.
 Mhm.
 Who
 should
 pay
 for
 the


green
 transition
 consumers
 taxpayers


companies?
 Hopefully
 you
 you
 manage
 to


balance
 the
 extra
 cost
 um
 and
 distribute


it
 in
 a
 manner
 that
 people
 can't
 afford


uh
 pay
 much
 less.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 when
 it


comes
 to
 subsidies
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 that
 uh
 from
 if
 you
 think
 of


the
 the
 citizens
 uh
 measures
 that


protect
 the
 most
 vulnerable
 in
 my
 mind


are
 welcome.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 many


people
 that
 don't
 mind
 to
 pay
 a
 little


bit
 more
 for
 the
 transition.
 So
 here
 we


have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 smart.
 Similarly


on
 the
 industries
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


example
 that
 we
 talked
 about
 which
 is
 if


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 a
 one-off


capex
 investment
 to
 completely
 change


your
 process
 to
 be
 able
 to
 electrify


your
 process
 for
 example
 as
 an
 example


then
 indeed
 I
 think
 the
 we
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 support


uh
 and
 potentially
 give
 a
 subsidies
 for


this
 oneoff
 capex
 investment
 for
 the


industries
 so
 then
 you
 know
 it's
 able
 to


stay
 in
 Europe
 and
 and
 consume
 you
 know


the
 energy
 and
 the
 electricity
 which


hopefully
 will
 be
 much
 less
 expensive
 in


the
 future.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 smart
 and
 making
 sure
 that


you
 know
 we
 we
 uh
 yeah
 I
 mean
 smartness


is
 really
 really
 important
 to
 make
 sure


that
 there
 is
 not
 overweight
 um
 that
 is


not
 too
 much
 weight
 on
 any
 given


constituents.
 Mhm.
 Um
 I
 think
 also
 you


have
 to
 really
 think
 when
 we
 talk
 about


the
 cost
 of
 the
 transition
 is
 the
 cost


of
 inaction.
 What
 happens
 when
 we
 don't


do
 that?
 You
 still
 depend
 on
 a
 lot
 of


imports.
 I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 at
 Europe


in
 2024,
 we
 imported
 375


billion
 of
 euros
 equivalent
 of
 fossil


energy
 all
 inclusive.
 It's
 it's
 amazing.


So
 you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about
 the


energy
 transition
 as
 also
 an
 opportunity


to
 develop
 uh
 industries
 to
 develop


better
 sovereignty
 to
 create
 jobs.
 You


know
 yesterday
 again
 I
 was
 on
 a
 small


island.
 This
 island
 very
 much
 lives
 on


tourism
 and
 today
 we
 are
 going
 to
 we
 are


opening
 now
 a
 base
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to


service
 this
 wind
 this
 wind
 farm
 the


project
 I
 mentioned
 and
 we
 are
 going
 to


create
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 less
 than
 100


jobs
 you
 see
 less
 than
 100
 job
 that


didn't
 exist
 and
 this
 is
 what
 you
 know


that
 energy
 transition
 when
 it
 comes


with
 new
 jobs
 when
 it's
 come
 with


positive
 impact
 on
 people's
 life
 then


you
 know
 yes
 maybe
 you
 know
 the
 the


transition
 has
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 cost,
 but
 it


has
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 benefits
 which
 you


know
 are
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 economies.


You
 mentioned
 100
 new
 jobs.
 Now
 you
 you


actually
 employ
 nearly
 100,000
 people.


Yeah.
 In
 30
 countries.
 What's
 the
 what's


the
 key
 to
 running
 a
 company
 like
 that?


Everything
 is
 about
 people.
 Um
 it's


making
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 the
 right


teams,
 um
 the
 right
 engagement.


Um
 when
 you
 have
 98,000
 people,
 what's


really
 important
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that


everybody
 knows
 um
 the
 key
 priorities,


the
 directions
 so
 that
 you
 know
 all


these
 efforts
 that
 teams
 and
 people
 are


making
 um
 individually
 translate
 into


actually
 impact
 because
 everybody
 is


pulling
 in
 the
 same
 directions.
 Uh
 at


least
 that
 was
 my
 experience
 when
 I


arrived
 four
 years
 ago,
 five
 years
 ago.


um
 is
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 efforts


but
 um
 people
 pulling
 in
 all
 kind
 of


directions
 and
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that


they
 align?
 So
 it's
 clear
 priorities


doing
 not
 too
 many
 different
 things


and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 explain


why
 why
 that
 that
 direction
 is
 the
 right


one.
 M
 um
 what
 we
 have
 in
 a
 group
 like


NG
 is
 people
 are
 super
 engaged
 on
 topics


like
 energy
 transition
 and
 and
 what
 was


really
 important
 to
 us
 was
 to
 make
 sure


that
 they
 understood
 that
 this
 purpose


and
 what
 we
 were
 trying
 to
 do
 with


energy
 transition
 was
 truly
 connected


with
 value
 creation.
 And
 if
 you
 connect


your
 value
 creation
 which
 means
 you
 know


business
 models


um
 and
 results
 results
 are
 really


important
 and
 you
 show
 that
 you
 you
 are


going
 to
 do
 the
 energy
 transition
 while


creating
 value
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to


do
 energy
 transition
 stuff
 if
 it
 doesn't


create
 value
 that
 is
 really
 important


because
 then
 people
 start
 to
 believe


they
 start
 to
 believe
 in
 the


sustainability
 of
 what
 you're
 doing


because
 sustainability
 in
 people's
 mind


sometimes
 it's
 just
 environment


sustainability,
 but
 actually
 it
 comes


also
 and
 I
 would
 say
 in
 before
 that
 it


comes
 with
 economic
 sustainability


because
 you
 know
 the
 the
 10
 billion


euros
 all
 in
 maintenance
 and
 gross
 capex


that
 we
 invest
 every
 year
 can
 only
 be


invested
 over
 time
 if
 you
 actually


generate
 cash
 flow.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 for


me
 it
 was
 really
 very
 important
 at
 NG


that
 we
 went
 through
 this
 work
 uh


internally
 to
 really
 demonstrate
 to
 our


teams
 that
 we
 had
 a
 model
 that
 was
 very


much
 yes
 we
 are
 going
 to
 do
 the
 energy


transition
 but
 we
 are
 going
 to
 do
 it
 in


an
 economically
 viable
 manner
 so
 that


it's
 going
 to
 withstand
 the
 test
 of


time.
 You
 the
 French
 uh
 the
 French


government
 owns
 a
 quarter
 of
 your


company
 roughly
 24.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 What
 uh


what
 kind
 of
 issues


uh
 does
 that
 raise?
 Honestly,
 the
 the


the
 the
 state
 shareholder
 uh
 acts


frankly
 as
 a
 I
 would
 say
 normal


shareholder
 very
 aligned
 with
 the


strategy.
 Well,
 they
 got
 more
 votes
 than


we
 have
 right
 they
 have
 there
 is
 a


certain
 amount
 of
 votes
 indeed.
 So
 they


have
 about
 33
 34%
 vote
 33
 I
 think
 from


so
 they
 are
 an
 important
 shareholder
 uh


but
 very
 supportive
 of
 the
 strategy
 of


the
 company
 and
 uh
 obviously
 very
 happy


with
 the
 dividend
 that
 we
 are
 paying
 uh


which
 has
 been
 a
 good
 dividend


particularly
 uh
 the
 past
 few
 years.
 So


frankly
 no
 nothing
 very
 specific.
 Do


they
 decide?
 I
 mean,
 do
 they
 do
 they


tell
 you
 what
 to
 do
 or
 do
 you
 call
 do


you
 call
 do
 you
 call
 them
 and
 say
 hi


hello
 can
 we
 do
 this?
 No,
 they
 are
 no


it's
 it's
 we
 are
 normal
 company
 Nikolai


we
 are
 normal
 company
 they
 have


obviously
 a
 position
 at
 the
 board
 uh


they
 have
 uh
 three
 board
 members
 um
 and


um
 so
 they
 they
 are
 important
 but
 uh
 no


they
 don't
 make
 decisions
 uh
 we
 just


have
 a
 normal
 governance
 normal
 board
 um


yeah
 and
 you
 know
 they
 want
 NG
 to
 be


successful
 um
 they
 want
 NG
 to
 be
 um


delivering
 on
 the
 strategy.
 Does
 it
 mean


that
 you
 can
 take
 a
 longerterm
 view
 than


you
 could
 have
 done
 if
 you
 hadn't
 had


the
 state
 as
 a
 main
 shareholder?
 I
 mean


they
 bring
 that
 perspective
 but
 we
 have


a
 lot
 of
 investors
 that
 take
 a
 long


view.
 Um
 when
 you
 invest
 in
 utility


you're
 not
 here
 for
 the
 short
 term.


You're
 not
 here
 for
 you
 know
 was
 it
 a


good
 quarter.
 I
 mean
 quarters
 are


important
 don't
 get
 me
 wrong
 but
 you


know
 most
 of
 our
 investors
 they
 expect


NG
 to
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 in
 the
 long


term.
 Freely
 appreciate
 that.
 We
 do
 have


we
 do
 have
 integrated
 energy
 companies


which
 have
 changed
 the
 speed
 of
 the


green
 transition
 on
 the
 back
 of


shareholder
 pressure
 right
 and
 you
 have


not
 done
 that.
 Yeah
 because
 maybe


because
 we
 have
 been
 convincing
 that
 the


way
 we
 would
 do
 our
 energy
 transition


would
 be
 value
 creating
 and
 you
 know


we've
 been
 I
 mean
 that's
 really
 the


whole
 our
 whole
 equity
 story
 hinges
 on


that.
 M
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 an
 ESG


backlash
 now
 that
 has
 not
 led
 to
 any


pressure
 on
 you
 to
 change
 your


priorities.
 No
 not
 not
 at
 all
 again


because
 you
 know
 we
 have
 not
 done
 ESG


just
 to
 please
 people.
 We
 we
 we
 have


aligned
 our
 activity


um
 and
 our
 business
 model
 with
 the


energy
 transition.
 So
 we
 have
 not


changed.
 Yeah.
 We're
 very
 consistent
 and


by
 the
 way
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 project
 we


don't
 do.
 We
 we
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


actions
 a
 lot
 of
 project
 where
 we
 think


this
 is
 not
 for
 us.
 You
 know
 if
 we're


not
 making
 if
 they're
 not
 good
 project


we
 won't
 do
 projects.
 Now
 you
 got
 a
 very


cool
 uh
 background
 born
 in
 Morocco.
 Uh
 I


was
 there
 the
 other
 day.
 Fantastic


place.
 Nice.
 Worked
 on
 oil
 rigs
 in


Congo.


Um
 like
 what's
 the
 most
 hairy
 experience


you've
 had
 during
 uh
 so
 far
 in
 your


life?


Well,
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 a
 number.
 I
 I


maybe
 just
 top
 of
 my
 head


that
 there
 was
 that
 that
 one
 person
 that


I
 met
 when
 I
 was
 in
 Congo
 on
 the
 on
 the


platform
 and
 I
 was
 I
 was
 wearing
 covers


obviously
 PP
 and
 um
 that
 that
 gentleman


told
 me
 that
 I
 would
 I
 would
 go
 to
 hell


and
 it
 was
 he
 didn't
 mean
 that
 you
 know


as
 an
 insult
 he
 was
 just
 but
 you
 know


mom
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 hell
 and
 I


said
 but
 why
 are
 you
 saying
 that
 and
 he


said
 you're
 wearing
 trousers
 and
 and


women
 wearing
 trousers
 you
 will
 go
 to


hell.
 And
 I
 explained
 to
 him
 that
 as
 I


was
 working
 on
 the
 platform,
 you
 know,
 I


had
 to
 have
 covers
 and
 and
 so
 that's


that
 was
 that
 was
 a
 a
 good
 one.
 But
 um


may
 maybe
 one
 of
 the
 the
 lesson
 that
 I


drew
 from
 from
 my
 early
 early
 years
 on


the
 on
 in
 the
 offshore
 world
 and
 then


later
 on
 is
 is
 adaptability.


It
 really
 prepares
 you
 well
 for
 being
 a


CEO
 after
 because
 you
 know
 you
 feel
 that


you
 can
 cope


almost
 with
 any
 challenges
 or


circumstances
 that
 present
 your
 way
 that


you
 know
 you
 somehow
 going
 to
 find
 your


footing
 fairly
 fairly
 quickly
 after.


Tell
 me
 more
 what
 how
 has
 that
 improved


your
 increased
 your
 resilience
 you
 think


by
 experiencing
 this?
 Well,
 but
 what


kind
 of
 things
 did
 you
 do
 on
 the


platform?
 On
 the
 platform
 I
 was
 working


as
 part
 of
 the
 recruit.
 Um
 but
 then
 you


like
 doing
 what
 what
 were
 you
 doing
 on


the
 platform?
 It
 was
 drilling
 rigs.
 So


just
 drilling
 crew
 working
 as
 a
 drilling


crew.
 Um
 and
 then
 eventually
 I
 went
 to


work
 as
 a
 service
 managers
 and
 so
 may


maybe


you
 know
 when
 when
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with


customers
 that
 have
 for
 example


expectation
 that
 a
 field
 service
 manager


you
 know
 should
 be
 um
 someone
 from


because
 I
 was
 based
 in
 the
 US
 at
 some


point.
 I
 was
 working
 in
 Louisiana
 and


so,
 you
 know,
 they
 would
 call
 me
 and
 and


then
 they
 would
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 the


person
 in
 charge
 and
 and
 they
 would


expect
 obviously
 a
 a
 male
 American


person
 and
 they
 were
 talking
 with
 a
 a


French
 woman.
 So
 you
 know
 I
 I
 didn't


meet
 at
 all
 the
 the
 I
 I
 guess
 the
 the


the
 their
 expectation
 of
 who
 they
 should


be
 talking
 to
 and
 so
 I
 remember
 they


they
 used
 to
 ask
 me
 but
 I
 want
 to
 talk


to
 the
 person
 in
 charge
 and
 I
 said
 but
 I


am
 in
 charge
 and
 so
 you
 know
 it
 created


this
 every
 time
 kind
 of
 additional


efforts
 to
 show
 that
 you
 were
 credible


as
 a
 as
 a
 counterparty
 and
 I
 think
 that


has
 helped
 me
 uh
 over
 time.
 um
 to
 yeah


to
 to
 adapt
 and
 and
 to
 also


um
 every
 time
 prove
 that
 you
 you
 you
 it


was
 it
 would
 be
 okay
 you
 know
 you
 would


be
 able
 to
 do
 the
 job.


Do
 you
 think
 it's
 giving
 you
 more


credibility
 with
 uh
 with
 the
 company
 the


fact
 that
 you've
 been
 at
 the
 tough
 end


of
 things
 and
 not
 only
 coming
 straight


from
 you
 know
 the
 gold
 and
 the
 ENA
 and


straight
 into
 CEO?
 I
 think
 the


operational
 background
 uh
 is
 is
 really


really
 helpful.
 Mhm.
 Uh


so
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think


I
 think
 to
 you
 know
 it's
 my
 operational


background
 I
 think
 gives
 me
 a
 I
 think


I'm
 quite
 grounded
 as
 a
 person
 and
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 helpful
 when
 I
 look
 at


what
 some
 of
 the
 challenges
 NG
 had
 and


has
 to
 face.
 I
 think
 that
 that
 that
 is


that
 comes
 handy.
 Yeah.
 Do
 you
 think
 you


take
 less
 I
 think
 so.
 I
 think


I'm,
 you
 know,
 when
 when
 you
 when
 you


work
 in
 a
 very
 operational
 word,
 uh,
 you


have
 this
 tendency
 to
 to
 go
 to
 cut
 to


the
 chase.
 Uh,
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 get


to
 what's
 really
 important.
 Uh,
 so
 yeah,


I
 I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that.


Now,
 um,
 any
 reflections
 on
 um,
 uh,


given
 uh,
 given
 that
 you
 were
 one
 of
 the


few,
 um,
 females
 on,
 you
 know,
 a


platform,
 any
 reflections
 on
 being
 a


woman
 CEO
 in
 today's
 world?
 we
 are
 not


enough.
 They
 are
 not
 enough
 of
 us.
 Um
 so


I
 still
 have
 sometimes,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 sentiment
 of
 loneliness.
 Uh
 still


finding
 myself
 in
 meetings
 where,
 you


know,
 I'm
 the
 only
 woman
 around
 the


table.
 It
 still
 happens
 to
 me,
 which
 is


a
 bit
 bizarre.
 Um


for
 me
 um
 maybe
 just
 the
 reflection
 is


um
 I
 know
 that
 you
 have
 to


as
 a
 CEO
 whether
 you're
 a
 woman
 or
 man


you
 have
 to
 care
 about
 this
 topic.


Um
 if
 not
 um
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 make
 any


progress.
 And
 so
 the
 reflection
 I
 have


is
 that
 I
 do
 spend
 more
 time
 I
 think


maybe
 than
 others
 I
 don't
 know
 but
 I
 I


do
 spend
 time
 um
 on
 these
 topics
 and
 I
 I


I
 really
 try
 to
 be
 very
 intentional
 in


making
 sure
 that
 our
 women
 talents
 get


developed
 to
 their
 whole
 capability.


What
 you
 learn
 from
 being
 on
 the


Microsoft
 board?
 Incredible
 company,


incredible
 board.
 um
 the
 pace


the
 pace
 of
 technology
 you
 know
 AI
 and


you
 know
 as
 a
 board
 members
 you
 know


it's
 you
 you
 you
 reconnect
 deeply
 every


quarter
 with
 with
 the
 company
 as
 a


minimum
 and
 and
 yeah
 the
 pace
 is


mind-blowing
 and
 and
 for
 me
 the
 what's


really
 fascinating
 is
 how
 you
 know
 as
 a


utility
 company
 which
 you
 know
 has
 a


certain
 amount
 of
 regulated
 activity
 and


has
 assets


uh
 change
 management
 and
 adoption


challenges,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 we
 cope


with
 the
 the
 pace
 of
 change
 that
 we
 see


on
 the
 pure
 technology
 side
 and
 how


these
 two
 words
 can
 remain
 synchronized


is
 something
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 about.


How
 do
 you
 relax?
 What's
 your
 private
 uh


charging
 station?
 Uh
 I
 try
 and
 save
 time


at
 the
 weekend.
 Um
 I
 go
 to
 the


countryside.
 Um
 I
 try
 to
 uh
 to
 read.
 I


read
 quite
 a
 bit
 and
 um
 sometimes
 for


work
 but
 also
 sometimes
 obviously
 uh
 for


for
 pleasure
 and
 I
 try
 not
 to
 overload


my
 social
 agenda
 during
 the
 weekend


because
 you
 know
 as
 the
 CEO
 we
 have


dinners
 and
 during
 the
 week
 so
 weekend
 I


try
 to
 really
 be
 in
 my
 own
 space
 it's


very
 close
 family
 um
 and
 and
 peace
 and


quiet
 and
 that's
 been
 working
 well
 for


me
 as
 a
 CEO
 since
 um
 since
 I
 joined.


What
 do
 you
 read?
 Oh,
 variety
 of
 stuff.


I
 can
 read,
 you
 know,
 very
 classic
 Jane


Austin,
 Marcel
 P
 even,
 uh,
 or
 more


modern
 stuff.
 Um,
 the
 other
 day
 I
 was


reading
 the
 the
 latest
 book
 of
 Reed


Huffman,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 co
 founder
 of
 of


LinkedIn
 also
 on
 Microsoft
 board
 and
 and


so
 and
 everything
 in
 between.
 Um,
 so,


um,
 yeah,
 I
 I
 read
 a
 lot.
 It's
 it's


really
 important
 in
 my
 life.
 Lastly,


what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people?
 You


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 people
 they
 ask
 me


about
 uh
 work
 life
 balance
 and
 all
 all


this
 stuff
 and
 I
 I
 you
 I
 think
 what's


really
 important
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that


they
 like
 what
 they
 do
 uh


professionally.
 So
 I
 mean
 it
 sounds
 very


cliche
 but
 you
 know
 opposing
 work
 and


life
 for
 me
 has
 always
 been
 a
 bit
 of
 a


mystery.
 I
 think
 what's
 really
 important


is
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 get
 a
 kick
 at


what
 you
 do
 and
 that
 would
 be
 really
 my


advice.
 Um
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 and
 at


least
 my
 experience
 has
 been
 that
 uh


don't
 necessarily
 be
 where
 people
 expect


you
 to
 be.
 Uh
 so
 stretch
 yourself
 and


and
 um
 and
 take
 some
 risk
 on
 your


career.
 Um
 don't
 necessarily
 think
 about


always
 doing
 the
 same
 thing
 but
 bigger,


you
 know,
 uh
 uh
 lateral
 moves
 and
 and


and
 uh
 think
 of
 your
 career
 as
 as
 a
 as
 a


combination
 of
 of
 bricks.
 eventually
 it


will
 it
 will
 be
 a
 great
 construction
 but


it
 might
 not
 be
 in
 the
 exact
 order
 that


you
 expected.
 So
 that's
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 I've
 learned
 along
 the
 way


in
 my
 career.
 Um
 and
 maybe
 the
 last


thing
 is
 indeed
 you
 know
 go
 for
 and
 work


for
 businesses
 that
 are
 building
 the


future.
 Um
 yeah
 we
 we
 use
 this
 thing


about
 f
 you
 know
 future
 proofing.
 I
 know


it's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 buzz
 word
 but
 there
 is


something
 true
 in
 that
 um
 that
 you
 know


if
 you
 work
 for
 companies
 whatever
 they


are
 and
 obviously
 I
 talk
 for
 NG
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 are
 actually


actively
 transitioning
 and
 decarbonizing


well
 it's
 a
 way
 to
 future
 proof


themselves


people
 really
 see
 well
 you
 know
 it's


cost
 and
 this
 but
 if
 you
 find
 value


creation
 and
 the
 right
 business
 model


and
 you
 decarbonize
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I


mean
 that's
 the
 company
 I
 would
 join
 if


I
 were


Absolutely.
 Well,
 Kath,
 you
 for
 sure
 are


building
 the
 future
 and
 uh
 clearly
 get
 a


kick
 out
 of
 what
 you
 do.
 So,
 that
 sounds


fantastic.
 Big
 thanks
 for
 being
 here


today.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 the


invitation.
