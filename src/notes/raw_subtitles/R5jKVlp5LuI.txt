hi
 everyone
 I'm
 Nikolai
 tangan
 the
 COO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 really
 happy
 to
 welcome
 Peter


Burling
 Peter
 Burling
 is
 uh
 well
 he's
 a


legend
 in
 sailing
 and
 uh
 won
 three


America's
 Cup
 victories
 including
 one


recently
 uh
 loads
 of
 World
 Championships


like
 like
 loads
 and
 loads
 and
 uh
 Olympic


championships
 as
 well
 so
 you've
 been


kind
 of
 dominating
 sailing
 lately
 so


welcome
 P
 hey
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 So


the
 plan
 is
 to
 tease
 out
 what
 we
 uh
 in


the
 business
 world
 and
 in
 the
 finance


world
 can
 learn
 from
 from
 the
 real


professionals
 so
 first
 of
 all
 um
 when


you
 win
 do
 you
 celebrate
 success
 yeah


yeah
 I
 think
 you
 definitely
 have
 to


celebrate
 the
 success
 um
 I
 mean
 with


every
 Victory
 there's
 there's
 so
 much


hard
 work
 that
 that
 goes
 behind
 that


building
 up
 to
 the
 competition
 I
 think


you've
 also
 got
 to
 celebrate
 the
 the
 end


of
 a
 milestone
 even
 if
 it
 it
 doesn't


quite
 go
 as
 well
 as
 as
 you
 would
 have


liked
 um
 but
 yeah
 it
 was
 definitely
 um


yeah
 the
 last
 America's
 Cup
 was
 a
 a


really
 enjoyable
 one
 to
 celebrate
 for


sure
 when
 you
 say
 celebrate
 what
 do
 you


mean
 um
 I
 mean
 is
 like
 like
 a
 cup
 of
 tea


and
 that's
 it


or
 it
 really
 depends
 normally
 after
 a


competition
 you're
 pretty
 tired
 so


normally
 you're
 just
 trying
 to
 enjoy
 the


moment
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 everyone
 that


that's
 got
 you
 there
 for
 an
 America's


Cup
 environment
 there's
 200
 people
 in


the
 team
 there's
 all
 the
 friends
 and


family
 um
 there's
 your
 own
 family
 yeah


there's
 just
 so
 many
 people
 that
 have
 I


suppos
 supported
 you
 along
 along
 that


journey
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 really
 nice
 to


be
 to
 share
 share
 a
 moment
 with
 everyone


just
 because
 generally
 you
 end
 up
 so


busy
 in
 the
 the
 actual
 competition
 phase


that
 you
 don't
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to
 to


really
 enjoy
 it
 with
 the
 people
 that


have
 have
 supported
 you
 to
 be
 there
 how


long
 are
 you
 happy
 for
 quite
 a
 while


um
 happy
 is
 quite
 a
 hard
 thing
 to


quantify
 right
 but
 yeah
 you
 really
 I


suppose
 get
 that
 sense
 of
 accomplishment


and
 pride
 of
 what
 you've
 managed
 to


achieve
 I
 think
 the
 the
 losses
 always


hurt
 a
 lot
 longer
 than
 the
 the
 wins
 are


are
 happy
 make
 you
 happy
 for
 um
 but
 yeah


either
 way
 I
 think
 it
 just
 fuels
 you


forward
 into
 the
 next
 adventure
 what
 do


you
 think
 is
 a
 key
 to
 kind
 of
 keep


yourself
 motivated
 for
 for
 such
 a
 long
 a


time
 you've
 done
 it
 now
 for
 many
 years


right
 well
 for
 me
 it's
 variety
 it's
 it's


doing
 things
 slightly
 differently
 I


think
 we're
 really
 lucky
 we're
 in
 a


sport
 where
 there's
 an
 incredible
 amount


of
 varieties
 and
 also
 the
 technolog
 is


evolving
 very
 quickly
 so
 you
 have
 um
 you


know
 different
 challenges
 you
 have
 to


overcome
 on
 a
 regular
 basis
 and
 you
 know


sailing's
 a
 quite
 a
 unique
 sport
 where


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 much
 a


decision-making
 sport
 um
 you
 definitely


do
 not
 get
 all
 the
 decisions
 correct


it's
 all
 about
 you
 know
 making
 one
 or


two
 more
 correct
 ones
 than
 someone
 else


and
 leveraging
 yourself
 and
 taking
 a
 bit


of
 risk
 when
 when
 you've
 got
 an


opportunity
 to
 to
 make
 a
 potential
 gain


but
 you're
 also
 knowing
 when
 to
 cut
 your


loss
 which
 is
 why
 I
 like
 to
 compare


investing
 with
 sailing
 because
 you
 could


be
 you
 could
 be
 ahead
 and
 then
 the
 win


changes
 and
 you
 are
 lost
 right
 and
 so


you
 lose
 it's
 not
 because
 of
 you
 and


it's
 the
 same
 in
 finance
 you
 know
 you


are
 you're
 doing
 really
 well
 Market


totally
 turns
 and
 you
 look
 like
 a


complete
 loser
 yeah
 oh
 I
 mean
 in
 our


sport
 is
 is
 so
 much
 of
 what
 is
 is


actually
 conservative
 and
 what
 what
 is


actually
 aggressive
 you
 know
 in
 a


traditional
 sense
 it's
 very
 obvious
 to


to
 a
 sailor
 what
 conservative
 or


aggressive
 is
 but
 you
 know
 when
 you


actually
 play
 scenarios
 fully
 out
 to
 an


end
 State
 it's
 quite
 hard
 sometimes
 to


tell
 whether
 something
 is
 um
 I
 suppose


traditionally
 would
 have
 looked
 very


aggressive
 but
 is
 actually
 what
 you


think
 is
 the
 last
 wor
 option
 at
 the
 time


or
 you
 know
 whether
 engaging
 with


another
 boat
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 taking
 the


conservative
 option
 is
 is
 not
 actually
 a


conservative
 option
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 it


over
 a
 a
 longer
 period
 so
 yeah
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 you
 know
 whether
 you're
 trying
 to


play
 against
 an
 opposition
 or
 whether


you're
 just
 almost
 trying
 to
 time
 trol


your
 race
 or
 are
 you
 an
 aggressive


sailor
 yeah
 I
 think
 so
 um
 yeah
 my


mindset
 is
 very
 much
 if
 there's
 an


opportunity
 to
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 take
 an


appropriate
 amount
 of
 of
 risk
 with
 it


you
 know
 whether
 it's
 how
 you're
 sailing


the
 boat
 but
 you
 know
 in
 saying
 that
 I


think
 you
 know
 as
 a
 sailor
 you
 want
 to


be
 technically
 good
 uh
 across
 the
 board


you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 any
 any


weaknesses
 so
 you
 can
 use
 uh
 all
 the


tools
 in
 the


toolbox
 for
 a
 very
 cliche
 cliche
 way
 of


saying
 it
 and
 take
 you
 know
 what
 options


you
 think
 are
 the
 correct
 ones
 at
 the


time
 now
 Ben
 anley
 who
 you
 beat
 in
 the


America's
 Cup
 said
 um
 your
 team
 now
 is


the
 best
 team
 sailing
 has
 ever
 seen
 what


do
 you
 think
 is
 your
 super
 strength
 I


think
 within
 a
 sport
 or
 a
 business
 you


don't
 have
 one
 super
 strength
 in
 sport


now
 everyone's
 very
 good
 um
 everyone


performs
 at
 a
 very
 high
 level
 but
 it's


making
 sure
 you
 do
 all
 the
 little
 things


really
 well
 you
 come
 together
 as
 a
 group


well
 you
 work
 um
 you're
 well
 with
 your


engineers
 you
 know
 your
 equipment


incredibly
 well
 and
 just
 the
 levels


getting
 so
 high
 that
 that
 everyone's


playing
 out
 at
 the
 moment
 that
 you're


always
 trying
 to
 look
 for
 these
 little


we
 gains
 that
 you
 know
 if
 you
 can
 find


one
 or
 two
 little
 gains
 across
 a
 an
 area


you
 very
 quickly
 get
 get
 quite
 a


significant
 jump
 so
 you
 know
 that's
 what


we
 try
 and
 do
 is
 think
 just
 trying
 to


continue
 to
 out
 learn
 and
 out
 improve


our
 opposition
 I
 don't
 think
 and
 I
 think


the
 rate
 of
 improvement
 is
 is
 more
 where


the
 the
 teams
 get
 defin
 what
 was
 the
 one


thing
 you
 did
 better
 than
 the
 UK
 team
 or


was
 it
 just
 lots
 of
 things
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 incredibly
 hard
 to
 tell
 and
 I
 say


that
 because
 we
 don't
 really
 know
 the


the
 ins
 and
 outs
 of
 of
 their
 program
 but


it
 was
 a
 pretty
 big
 beat
 very
 well
 yeah


yeah
 we
 we
 felt
 like
 we
 were
 really


confident
 with
 with
 our
 piece
 of


equipment
 you
 know
 and
 how
 we
 we
 sailed


that
 and
 how
 we
 dealt
 with
 the


decision-making
 process
 around
 the
 boat


the
 America
 scout
 boats
 have
 become
 very


interesting
 because
 you
 have
 a
 huge


blind
 spot
 now
 so
 you're
 kind
 of
 really


relying
 on
 the
 people
 on
 the
 other
 side


of
 the
 yacht
 to
 to
 help
 you
 make
 some
 of


the
 decisions
 and
 to
 to
 utilize
 their


View
 at
 at
 the
 time
 to
 to
 keep
 you
 in


the
 correct
 part
 on
 the
 race
 course
 and


you
 I
 think
 we
 did
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


that
 on
 our
 boat
 as
 is
 making
 sure
 we're


always
 making
 good
 decisions
 around
 the


race
 course
 and
 you
 know
 distributed
 the


the
 load
 really
 well
 around
 the
 boat


it's
 become
 very
 technical
 theing
 now


yeah
 it's
 tell
 us
 about
 some
 of
 the
 kind


of
 technicalities
 of
 it
 some
 data
 I
 mean


it's
 the
 boats
 are
 getting
 incredibly


technical
 on
 the
 composite
 side
 there'


be
 the
 most
 strained
 kind
 of
 composits


out
 there
 in
 the
 world
 because
 we're


pushing
 the
 boundaries
 very
 high
 um
 we


have
 a
 incredible
 amount
 of
 monitoring


on
 those
 so
 we
 can
 push
 right
 up
 against


the
 limit
 and
 you
 know
 also
 that
 that


monitoring
 while
 you're
 sailing
 and
 then


also
 the
 monitoring
 you
 know
 when
 you


get
 back
 to
 shore
 to
 see
 if
 there's
 been


any
 start
 of
 degradation
 on
 the
 on
 the


components
 you
 know
 you
 can
 pretty
 much


go
 back
 in
 the
 data
 and
 look
 at
 whatever


camera
 angle
 of
 whatever
 incident
 and


hear
 exactly
 what
 was
 said
 on
 the
 comms


um
 so
 it
 makes
 for
 this
 really
 kind
 of


open
 transparent
 conversations
 because


you
 know
 all
 the
 data
 is
 there
 all
 the


comms
 all
 the
 audio
 is
 there
 so
 you
 can


really
 get
 to
 the
 bottom
 of
 of
 whatever


is
 going
 on
 pretty
 quickly
 what's
 kind


of
 the
 coolest
 information
 stream
 you


have
 as
 a
 when
 you
 at
 you
 know
 Drive


well
 I
 think
 your
 um
 human
 interfaces
 is


really
 interesting
 and
 and
 has
 evolved
 a


really
 long
 way
 um
 you
 know
 the
 way
 you


interact
 with
 the
 boat
 um
 you
 know


whether
 it's
 through
 the
 steering
 wheel


or
 the
 the
 control
 surfaces
 you
 use
 and


then
 how
 that
 data
 gets
 projected
 back


to
 you
 through
 the
 screens
 is
 a
 massive


Loop
 that
 continues
 to
 evolve
 very
 very


quickly
 but
 you
 know
 also
 the
 way
 that


you
 know
 now
 you
 can
 interface
 back
 with


the
 shaw
 you
 know
 you
 can
 really
 cut


down
 your
 your
 iteration
 cycle
 Time
 by


you
 know
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 watching


live
 data
 and
 then
 actually
 going
 over


the
 data
 and
 giving
 you
 more
 things
 to


try
 um
 are
 you
 allowed
 to
 communicate


with
 them
 during
 the
 race
 not
 during
 the


race
 but
 that's
 more
 in
 the
 race


building
 up
 or
 on
 a
 training
 day
 once


the
 race
 comes
 at
 3
 minutes
 to
 go
 from


the
 race
 you're
 you're
 shut
 off
 and


you're
 on
 your
 your
 own
 little
 bubble
 so


you've
 got
 to
 I
 suppose
 monitor
 a
 lot
 of


systems
 on
 the
 yacht
 at
 that
 time
 as


well
 make
 sure
 that
 things
 are
 all


working
 as
 as
 they
 should
 and
 that
 you


um
 aren't
 overloading
 anything
 on
 the
 on


the
 package
 because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 in
 the
 boat
 that
 are
 sitting


right
 up
 against
 the
 the
 peak
 loads
 a


lot
 of
 the
 time
 so
 yeah
 I
 mean
 it's
 a


really
 fun
 space
 I
 before
 I
 got
 fully


into
 sailing
 um
 got
 halfway
 through
 an


engineering
 degree
 in
 Oakland
 and
 and


yeah
 I
 really
 love
 that
 Technology


Innovation
 side
 you
 like
 them
 more
 than


the
 S
 do
 you
 like
 the
 tech
 more
 than
 the


saing
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 more
 but
 I
 think


trying
 to
 get
 the
 most
 out
 of
 a
 bit
 of


equipment
 and
 being
 able
 to
 evolve
 and


adapt
 that
 bit
 of
 equipment
 as
 you
 go
 is


um
 something
 I
 really
 enjoy
 do
 you
 think


the
 technology
 background
 has
 helped
 you


and
 the
 America's
 Cup
 and
 and
 in
 sailing


I
 think
 in
 general
 for
 sure
 it
 has
 a
 a


really
 big
 benefit
 um
 on
 the
 America's


Cup
 it's
 uh
 very
 much
 being
 able
 to
 have


a
 lot
 better
 conversation
 with
 the


engineers
 and
 the
 the
 design
 is
 orbe
 it


they're
 at
 a
 much
 higher
 level
 than
 than


I
 ever
 would
 be
 in
 a
 specific
 field
 just


being
 able
 to
 understand
 enough
 I


suppose
 base
 principle
 around
 you
 know


why
 something's
 doing
 what
 it
 should
 be


doing
 or
 how
 the
 global
 structures
 kind


of
 in
 the
 big
 picture
 items
 are
 coming


together
 I
 think
 is
 really
 beneficial
 um


you
 know
 and
 then
 but
 also
 then
 when


you're
 trying
 to
 hedge
 one
 side
 or


another
 of
 a
 problem
 um
 you
 know
 just


having
 a
 little
 more
 base
 understanding


of
 of
 what
 is
 actually
 going
 on
 within


that
 that
 uh
 situation
 is
 is
 I
 think


really
 really
 positive
 do
 you
 training


simulators
 yeah
 the
 simulators
 become
 a


huge
 Tool
 uh
 in
 in
 the
 world
 of
 sailing


like
 it
 has
 in
 in
 the
 world
 of


Motorsport
 not
 only
 for
 I
 suppose


designing
 the
 boat
 choosing
 kind
 of
 what


compromises
 you
 want
 to
 make
 on
 the


equipment
 because
 there's
 always


positives
 and
 negatives
 to
 to
 any


decision
 um
 you
 know
 there
 there's
 times


where
 you
 can
 take
 a
 gain
 on
 on
 both


sides
 of
 the
 coin
 but
 you
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 times
 where
 you're
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 where
 you're
 trying
 to
 position
 your


package
 relative
 to
 where
 you're


guessing
 your
 opposition
 might
 be
 or


whether
 you're
 where
 you're
 guessing
 the


forecast
 might
 be
 which
 has
 become


incredibly
 hard
 of
 late
 with
 the
 I


suppose
 forecasts
 becoming
 so
 far
 off


what
 they
 traditionally
 would
 have
 been


if
 you
 looked
 at
 a
 5year
 average
 but


yeah
 the
 simulation
 just
 become
 a


massive
 tool
 both
 in
 the
 the
 design


space
 being
 able
 to
 make
 sure
 you're


you're
 picking
 a
 good
 good
 concept
 um


you
 know
 also
 getting
 all
 your
 muscle


memory
 around
 how
 you're
 using
 your
 user


input
 devices
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 racing
 side
 as
 well
 being


able
 to
 get
 enough
 Cadence
 and
 how
 much


time
 do
 you
 spend
 in
 that
 simulator
 it


it
 varies
 massively
 on
 how
 much
 load


we're
 doing
 on
 the
 water
 at
 the
 same


time
 but
 we
 try
 and
 make
 the
 simulator


as
 close
 to
 reality
 as
 possible
 because


it's
 um
 I
 suppose
 really
 good
 for
 for


the
 practice
 racing
 side
 but
 then
 also


it
 means
 that
 um
 you
 know
 you
 can
 design


a
 faster
 boat
 because
 your
 your


simulator
 is
 actually
 as
 close
 to


reality
 as
 you
 can
 get
 it
 how
 do
 you


prepare
 uh
 mentally
 before
 I


race
 have
 you
 got
 a
 particular
 way
 of


doing
 it
 do
 you
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 every


time
 no


probably
 relatively
 low
 on
 my


Superstition
 Factor
 um
 if
 you
 looked
 at


a
 traditional
 athlete
 um
 you
 know
 one


thing
 I
 really
 like
 to
 do
 is
 make
 sure
 I


come
 into
 a
 big
 event
 knowing
 that
 I've


done
 all
 the
 the
 preparation
 to
 the
 the


highest
 level
 I
 I
 could
 yeah
 um
 knowing


that
 you've
 done
 hard
 work
 and
 you've


really
 maximized
 the
 the
 time
 before
 the


the
 competition
 to
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 in


the
 the
 space
 you
 need
 to
 be
 but
 also


your
 equipment
 and
 you're
 really


comfortable
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 decision-


making
 processes
 how
 things
 are
 going
 to


unfold
 yeah
 it's
 I
 mean
 it's
 an


interesting
 conversation
 when
 you
 talk


to
 people
 about
 you
 know
 whether
 the


when
 it
 comes
 to
 a
 competition
 they've


been
 eagerly
 awaiting
 that
 competition


for
 a
 few
 days
 or
 whether
 they
 feel
 like


they're
 just
 ready
 for
 the
 competition


when
 the
 competition
 arrives
 um
 you
 I'd


say
 I'm
 more
 on
 the
 you
 know
 side
 of


feeling
 like
 I'm
 ready
 for
 a
 competition


on
 the
 first
 day
 of
 of
 the
 competition


normally
 try
 and
 continue
 to
 be
 um


trying
 to
 progress
 right
 up
 to
 that
 and


right
 through
 the
 competitions
 yeah


we've
 also
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 with
 uh
 a


few
 psychologists
 just
 trying
 to
 make


sure
 you
 mentally
 get
 in
 the
 the
 right


head
 space
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 one
 thing


in
 sport
 that
 has
 come
 a
 long
 way
 in
 the


last
 20
 years
 is
 making
 sure
 and


allowing
 people
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


consistent
 with
 their
 players
 making


sure
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 tools
 within
 your


own
 quiver
 to
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 you're


ready
 to
 go
 out
 there
 and
 compete
 moving


on
 to
 um
 uh
 Team
 Dynamics
 so
 you
 have
 a


partner
 Blair
 juk
 you've
 been
 sing


together
 for
 a
 long
 time
 right
 yeah
 yeah


how
 long
 2009
 so
 yeah
 it's
 a
 we
 while


ago
 now
 15
 years
 or
 something
 yeah
 um


yeah
 we
 started
 our
 relationship
 in
 the


the
 49er
 um
 and
 then
 have
 sailed


together
 on
 you
 know
 s
 GP
 and
 and
 also


the
 America's
 Cup
 so
 yeah
 we
 get
 go
 long


with
 and
 you
 were
 in
 the
 49er
 you
 were


like
 a
 consistently
 world
 champion
 over


a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 yep
 um
 we
 won


three
 Olympic
 medals
 together
 uh
 two
 two


ended
 up
 being
 silver
 so
 the
 first
 one


felt
 like
 uh
 yeah
 we
 were
 on
 this


massive
 learning
 curve
 never
 really
 got


to
 the
 Australians
 that
 that
 ended
 up


beating
 us
 so
 we
 were
 really
 happy
 with


that
 Silva
 and
 then
 went
 back
 the
 next


time
 round
 and
 didn't
 lose
 for
 the
 the


fouryear
 cycle
 can't
 remember
 how
 many


events
 but
 quite
 a
 few
 on
 the
 TR
 and
 and


one
 with
 a
 huge
 margin
 at
 the
 Olympics


and
 then
 Rio
 in
 Rio
 and
 then
 obviously


to
 how
 big
 was
 a
 Marin
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


record
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 fully
 remember


that's
 exactly
 right
 it
 was
 record


what's
 it
 was
 comfortable
 yeah
 what's


the
 secret
 behind
 a
 successful


collaboration
 over
 such
 a
 long
 time
 oh
 I


think
 playing
 to
 strengths
 a
 little
 bit


um
 me
 and
 bl
 would
 be
 quite
 different


people
 um
 but
 in
 saying
 that
 we've
 got
 a


lot
 of
 similar
 passions
 we
 both
 love
 the


outdoors
 we're
 both
 really
 competitive


and
 we
 both
 often
 share
 the
 the
 same


goal
 so
 you
 know
 just
 that
 understanding


of
 you
 you
 know
 that
 you're
 never
 going


to
 make
 um
 you
 know
 all
 the
 decisions


right
 but
 you're
 both
 trying
 to
 head
 to


the
 the
 same
 place
 and
 it's
 not
 always


uh
 you
 know
 full
 of
 happy
 families


you've
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 good


discussions
 and
 some
 people
 might
 say


this
 like
 minor
 conflict
 but
 you
 know


you've
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 those


healthy
 conversations
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 how
 to
 actually
 shift
 from
 where


you
 are
 now
 to
 to
 to
 a
 better
 place
 and


you
 know
 that's
 um
 something
 that
 you


know
 I
 think
 really
 keeps
 keeps
 things


fresh
 and
 and
 pushes
 you
 forward
 now
 how


what
 does
 a
 disagreement
 look
 like


between
 the
 two
 of


you
 it's
 relatively
 passive
 but
 yeah


just
 it's
 more
 around
 discussion
 as
 to


you
 know
 coming
 up
 with
 theories
 as
 to


why
 something
 should
 work
 or
 not
 do
 you


lose
 your
 temper
 um
 no
 I'm
 pretty
 pretty


calm
 as
 a
 person
 I
 think
 in
 our
 sport
 if


you
 lose
 your
 temper
 too
 easily
 you
 can


really
 throw
 away
 a
 lot
 of
 points
 which


or
 throw
 away
 opportunities
 to
 to
 close


out
 events
 uh
 the
 margins
 are
 so
 small


now
 that
 you
 just
 can't
 really
 allow


that
 to
 happen
 and
 what's
 the
 key
 to


stay


calm
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 think
 um
 you
 I've


grown
 up
 in
 New
 Zealand
 where
 you
 know


everything's
 relatively
 relaxed
 um
 do


you
 think
 anger
 has
 a
 place
 in


management
 at
 all
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 to


show
 frustration
 at
 times
 you've


definitely
 got
 to
 you
 know
 make
 sure
 you


you
 let
 people
 know
 when
 you
 know
 where


the
 boundaries
 are
 but
 you've
 also
 got


to
 create
 an
 environment
 where
 people


aren't
 afraid
 to
 to
 be
 Innovative
 to
 to


try
 things
 to
 develop
 to
 take
 risk
 um
 so


I
 think
 with
 everything
 there's
 always
 a


real
 balance
 you
 know
 you
 want
 people
 to


not
 be
 afraid
 to
 to
 take
 risk
 you
 want


people
 to
 put
 their
 hand
 up
 when
 they


make
 mistakes
 and
 you
 want
 to
 really


create
 that
 environment
 where
 people
 are


really
 enjoying
 what
 they
 do
 because
 you


know
 if
 you're
 enjoying
 what
 you
 do
 it's


so
 much
 easier
 to
 put
 in
 the
 that
 extra


bit
 of
 effort
 that
 you
 need
 to
 to


perform
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 so
 I
 think


you
 know
 environment
 is
 such
 a
 a
 big


part
 of
 of
 what
 we
 do
 and
 you
 know


trying
 to
 give
 people
 the
 freedom
 to
 to


learn
 and
 grow
 and
 improve
 and
 see
 a


progression
 in
 themselves
 it's
 something


that's
 incredibly
 important
 but
 you
 know


then
 obviously
 trying
 to
 push
 it
 in
 a
 in


a
 really
 healthy
 direction
 for
 the
 the


teams
 really
 important
 as
 well
 so
 yeah
 I


think
 that
 part
 of
 you
 know
 how
 the


feedback
 loop
 works
 is
 really
 important


how
 the
 debriefing
 works
 so
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 debrief
 I
 think
 we're
 really


lucky
 that
 we
 have
 these
 moments
 where


you
 get
 to
 compete
 and
 you
 get
 you
 know


to
 put
 your
 cards
 on
 the
 table
 and
 see


how
 things
 have
 performed
 and
 and
 then


go
 back
 and
 learn
 from
 that
 so
 we


generally
 would
 debrief
 we
 make
 sure
 we


get
 feedback
 from
 the
 entire
 group
 you


have
 a
 whole
 debrief
 straight
 away
 and


then
 a
 bigger
 one
 or
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 do
 it
 yeah
 we'd
 have
 a
 debrief
 after


every
 day
 and
 then
 debrief
 either


whether
 it's
 periodically
 or
 after


events
 depending
 on
 how
 long
 it's
 been


when
 you're
 trying
 to
 make
 some
 good


decisions
 about
 where
 where
 you
 should


go
 forward
 having
 a
 little
 look
 back
 is


always
 a
 an
 incredibly
 healthy
 thing
 to


do
 at
 that
 stage
 and
 not
 be
 afraid
 to
 to


make
 change
 it's
 also
 making
 sure
 you


debrief
 the
 wins
 just
 as
 much
 as
 the
 the


losses
 I
 think
 you
 can
 always
 learn
 a


lot
 by
 you
 know
 what
 things
 have
 have


worked
 really
 well
 um
 in
 a
 wi
 but
 even


in
 a
 wi
 there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 you
 still
 want
 to
 improve
 and
 get


better
 on
 so
 you
 know
 most
 people
 I


don't
 think
 are
 consistent
 enough
 on


their
 their
 review
 processes
 and
 their


you
 know
 feedback
 loops
 as
 to
 how
 people


can
 can
 improve
 and
 get
 better
 because


it
 strike
 me
 that
 um
 these
 uh
 feedback


sessions
 in
 sport
 are
 much
 more
 honest


and
 transparent
 than
 they
 are
 in


business
 and
 in
 many
 other
 places
 in


society
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 think
 in
 sport
 you


have
 a
 a
 lot
 less
 um
 Avenue
 to
 hide
 so


you
 know
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 not


completely
 honest
 and
 transparent
 people


can
 tell
 that's
 straight
 away
 but
 also


everyone's
 there
 trying
 to
 to
 push
 for


the
 same
 outcome
 so
 you've
 there
 what
 I


was
 trying
 to
 talk
 about
 before
 with
 the


environment
 you
 know
 you
 want
 to
 create


an
 environment
 where
 people
 are
 you
 know


honest
 about
 you
 know
 whether
 they
 think


something's
 worked
 or
 not
 or
 and
 aren't


afraid
 to
 put
 their
 hand
 up
 and
 and
 say


something
 if
 they
 think
 it's
 not
 um
 you


know
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 you
 can
 waste


going
 around
 in
 circles
 where
 someone's


made
 a
 small
 mistake
 there
 and
 you


haven't
 quite
 figured
 that
 out
 and
 they


haven't
 put
 their
 hand
 up
 um
 you
 know


the
 inefficiencies
 that
 can
 flow
 on
 from


something
 like
 that
 are
 massive
 and
 you


know
 time's
 always
 the
 the
 enemy
 you


know
 in
 sport
 you've
 got
 a
 hard
 deadline


of
 a
 competition
 normally
 that
 you're


building
 up
 against
 so
 you
 know
 that


time
 is
 the
 only
 thing
 you
 you
 can't


slow
 down
 it
 kind
 of
 keeps
 marching
 so


you
 know
 how
 much
 efficiency
 you
 can


gain
 through
 the
 debriefing
 process
 and


people
 being
 honest
 but
 also
 willing
 to


I
 suppose
 push
 the
 boundaries
 enough
 and


and
 put
 their
 head
 out
 at
 times
 to
 to


take
 something
 on
 I
 definitely
 feel
 like


one
 of
 my
 main
 roles
 within
 the


America's
 Cup
 is
 really
 managing
 a
 bit


of
 that
 risk
 profile
 and
 kind
 of


understanding
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 big


Global
 decisions
 and
 How
 likely
 that
 is


to
 to
 result
 in
 us
 not
 being
 able
 to
 do


a
 race
 or
 not
 being
 able
 to
 do
 a


training
 session
 or
 what
 compromises


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 make
 to
 to
 keep
 a


bit
 of
 equipment
 in
 one
 piece
 p
 a
 lot
 of


its
 efficiency
 related
 as
 well
 so
 this


focus
 on
 process
 rather
 than
 uh
 results


have
 you
 always
 uh
 being
 process


oriented
 yeah
 I
 think
 I've
 always
 been


very
 process
 orientated
 but
 um
 one
 thing


I
 would
 say
 is
 you
 need
 enough


flexibility
 within
 a
 framework
 um
 to
 be


able
 to
 create
 Innovation
 and
 to


continue
 to
 improve
 also
 if
 you
 get
 to


process
 focused
 and
 just
 go
 through
 and


D
 do
 do
 and
 that's
 you
 and
 off
 you
 go


then
 you
 you
 end
 up
 quite
 stagnant
 and


and
 it
 doesn't
 progress
 you
 need
 enough


structure
 that
 people
 know
 where
 they


should
 be
 what
 tasks
 they
 should
 be


doing
 but
 you
 need
 enough
 space
 within


that
 structure
 that
 they
 can
 grow
 and


take
 risks
 and
 do
 different
 things
 and


then
 to
 rebuild
 that
 that
 process
 on
 a


regular
 enough
 basis
 that
 it's
 still


relevant
 to
 what
 you're
 doing
 at
 the


time
 you
 go
 back
 to
 an
 efficiency
 thing


like
 the
 process
 you're
 doing
 at
 the


time
 to
 on
 an
 efficiency
 thing
 is
 is
 so


important
 and
 you
 know
 even
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 the
 amount
 of
 meetings
 you're


having
 how
 productive
 everyone
 in
 that


meeting
 is
 being
 at
 the
 time
 they're
 in


the
 meeting
 whether
 people
 are
 sitting


in
 a
 meeting
 to
 say
 you
 know
 two
 words


and
 they've
 kind
 of
 wasted
 an
 hour
 of


their
 day
 or
 whether
 they're
 kind
 of


fully
 engaged
 and
 it's
 a
 um
 a
 download


of
 information
 to
 a
 wider
 group
 it


there's
 so
 many
 points
 in
 a
 in
 a


campaign
 in
 a
 sporting
 environment
 where


you
 can
 gain
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 your
 day


or
 you
 can
 lose
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 your


day
 and
 not
 just
 for
 one
 person
 for
 a


wider
 Group
 which
 is
 I
 mean
 exactly
 the


same
 business
 if
 you're
 having
 a
 meeting


you
 you
 want
 people
 to
 feel
 like
 they


can
 walk
 into
 the
 meeting
 and
 you
 know


if
 they're
 not
 engaged
 in
 that
 meeting


to
 be
 able
 to
 not
 feel
 obliged
 to
 be


there
 and
 go
 ahead
 and
 do
 something
 else


the
 just
 the
 efficiencies
 you
 can
 derive


from
 from
 that
 I
 suppose
 flexibility


within
 a
 process
 is
 so
 key
 tell
 me
 about


the
 communication
 so
 you
 sit
 on
 each


side
 of
 of
 the
 sale
 right
 so
 you
 you
 you


can
 only
 see
 half
 the
 course
 yep
 so


you're
 pretty
 dependent
 on
 communicating


with
 the
 other
 guy
 yeah
 so
 in
 the
 americ


cup
 you
 I
 sat
 on
 the
 the
 starbard
 helmet


the
 I
 supp
 Skipper
 of
 our
 boat
 and
 then


I
 had
 another
 Helmsman
 on
 the
 the
 port


side
 Nathan
 outage
 who
 sat
 on
 the
 other


side
 and
 then
 we
 had
 um
 two
 trimmers


essentially
 sitting
 in
 front
 of
 both
 me


and
 Nathan
 so
 Blair
 set
 on
 the
 the
 port


side
 and
 Guy
 Andy
 sat
 on
 the
 starbard


side
 um
 but
 yeah
 at
 certain
 times
 you


can't
 see
 very
 much
 that
 way
 or
 you're


concentrating
 very
 hard
 on
 keeping
 the


boat
 going
 fast
 so
 what's
 the
 key
 what's


the
 key
 to
 good
 communication
 well
 on


the
 yacht
 we
 we
 all
 talk
 through
 a


headset
 so
 it's
 very
 loud
 so
 you
 have


your
 MFS
 on
 and
 you
 have
 your
 your


microphone
 right
 in
 front
 of
 you
 face


for
 us
 we
 try
 and
 talk
 it
 like
 we're


talking
 here
 normal
 volume
 and
 you
 can


say
 things
 so
 much
 quicker
 uh
 if
 you're


talking
 at
 a
 normal
 volume
 rather
 than


having
 to
 yell
 um
 but
 yeah
 being
 very


careful
 of
 I
 suppose
 your
 phrasing
 in


our
 communication
 Loop's
 really


important
 making
 sure
 you
 have
 ways
 of


getting
 information
 across
 very
 quickly


so
 you
 don't
 clog
 up
 the
 the
 coms
 Loop


because
 essentially
 only
 one
 person
 can


talk
 at
 a
 time
 on
 that
 that
 cons
 Loop


and
 knowing
 kind
 of
 who
 should
 be


feeding
 in
 what
 information
 at
 what
 time


so
 you're
 expecting
 to
 hear
 something


from
 a
 certain
 voice
 is
 very
 key
 as
 well


and
 you
 told
 me
 before
 that
 um
 you
 know


even
 if
 you
 are
 500
 M
 ahead
 or
 500
 me


behind
 you
 cannot
 discern
 the
 difference


in
 your
 voice
 and
 your
 level
 yeah
 you


shouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 really
 tell


normally
 we'd
 have
 a
 few
 checks
 and


balances
 within
 that
 if
 if
 say
 there's


um
 a
 lot
 of
 action
 going
 on
 or
 it's
 a


kind
 of
 very
 busy
 thing
 or
 there's
 kind


of
 some
 indecision
 around
 what
 exactly


we
 should
 be
 doing
 at
 a
 certain
 time
 and


things
 are
 getting
 a
 little
 but


heightened
 like
 having
 a
 good
 way
 of


bringing
 things
 back
 down
 to
 the
 level


they
 should
 be
 generally
 for
 us
 you
 know


heightened
 to
 not
 but
 quiet
 is
 uh
 the


very
 small
 band
 compared
 to
 what
 most


people
 would
 operate
 with
 him
 um
 but
 you


get
 to
 know
 people
 well
 enough
 and
 you


compete
 with
 them
 enough
 that
 you
 know


that
 you
 know
 whether
 they're
 working
 in


a
 good
 good
 window
 or
 they're
 you
 know


feeling
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 bit
 of
 tension
 in
 a


in
 a
 scenario
 or
 I
 mean
 that's
 the
 joy


of
 sport
 you
 get
 to
 go
 and
 compete


against
 the
 best
 people
 in
 the
 world
 and


you
 know
 see
 how
 how
 good
 you
 really
 are


and
 you've
 got
 absolutely
 nowhere
 to


hide
 because
 everything's
 on
 the


broadcast
 is
 so
 many
 camera
 angles


there's
 so
 much
 data
 out
 there
 that


you've
 got
 to
 really
 go
 out
 there
 and


put
 your
 best
 foot
 forward
 and
 and
 be


judged
 from
 that
 you
 mentioned
 there


were
 200
 people
 on
 your
 team
 what's
 the


what's
 the
 key
 to
 be
 a
 good
 manager
 of


200
 people
 well
 personally
 I
 quite
 like


a
 relative
 so
 I'm
 sorry
 just
 get
 right


so
 on
 board
 the
 boat
 you
 are
 how
 many
 on


board
 the
 boat
 we're
 eight
 yeah
 four
 uh


two
 two
 drivers
 two
 drivers
 two
 trimmers


and
 four
 um
 power
 related
 roles
 yeah


basically
 biking
 right
 yeah
 so
 nor


America's
 couple
 was
 um
 all
 biking
 and


then
 you
 have
 obviously
 your
 reserves
 on


both
 sides
 so
 the
 the
 power
 related
 guys


end
 up
 rolling
 through
 I
 suppose
 people


just
 because
 it's
 it's
 very
 intensive
 on


the
 other
 level
 they've
 got
 a
 got
 a


perform
 at
 and
 then
 we
 have
 in
 the


Design
 Group
 um
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


there
 you
 can
 also
 communicate
 directly


to
 them
 when
 you're
 training
 um
 you
 have


people
 on
 the
 chase
 boat
 you
 have
 your


safety
 people
 you
 have
 your
 boat


Builders
 you
 have
 a
 massive
 amount
 of
 of


projects
 going
 on
 and
 I
 think
 having
 you


know
 a
 really
 good
 structure
 within
 that


where
 you
 have
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 you


know
 people
 taking
 a
 lot
 of


responsibilities
 really
 important
 now


you
 began
 sailing
 when
 you
 were
 six


right
 yeah
 it
 was
 a
 little
 while
 ago
 now


um
 but
 yeah
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 New
 Zealand
 so


grew
 up
 in
 and
 around
 the
 water
 and


actually
 my
 dad
 had
 sailed
 when
 he
 was


younger
 and
 kind
 of
 stopped
 sailing
 and


got
 my
 brother
 into
 it
 so
 I
 was
 getting


dragged
 along
 to
 start
 with
 and
 then


decided
 to
 be
 more
 fun
 to
 go
 and
 give
 it


a
 go
 than
 sit
 on
 the
 beach
 um
 you
 I


think
 we're
 very
 Lucky
 in
 New
 Zealand


that
 so
 much
 of
 our
 our
 nation


surrounded
 by
 water
 um
 and
 so
 many


people
 live
 so
 close
 to
 the
 coast
 it's
 a


generally
 pretty
 warm
 climate
 especially


if
 you
 compared
 it
 to
 somewhere
 like


Norway
 where
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 year


you
 couldn't
 actually
 go
 on
 sale
 you


know
 New
 Zealand
 you
 could
 sail
 all
 year


round
 yeah
 something
 as
 a
 young
 guy


getting
 out
 there
 um
 and
 kind
 of
 making


some
 decisions
 with
 what
 to
 do
 with
 your


boat
 and
 um
 getting
 to
 race
 against
 some


other
 people
 was
 I
 found
 really
 good
 fun


and
 it's
 been
 been
 an
 amazing
 journey
 so


when
 you
 grow
 up
 in
 New
 Zealand
 you
 have


to
 kind
 of
 juice
 I'm
 either
 going
 to
 do


sailing
 or


rugby
 is
 uh
 yeah
 or
 um
 soccer
 football


as
 um
 getting
 incredibly
 popular
 now
 as


well
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 think
 explains
 New


Zealand's
 success
 in
 sailing
 I
 think
 if


people
 knew
 it
 would
 be
 easy
 to
 emulate


but
 yeah
 I
 think
 we've
 um
 you
 know
 as
 a


nation
 we're
 relatively
 Innovative


people
 um
 and
 we
 just
 have
 a
 really
 good


AFF
 Affinity
 with
 the
 water
 most
 people


have
 I
 mean
 so
 many
 fond
 memories
 with


the
 water
 when
 they
 they
 grow
 up
 and


just
 love
 being
 in
 and
 around
 the
 water


that
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that's
 just
 LED


through
 to
 a
 really
 high
 level
 of
 um


sailing
 in
 our
 country
 and
 for
 as
 long


as
 I
 can
 remember
 it's
 just
 always
 been


that
 way
 I
 think
 you
 know
 success
 breeds


success
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 as
 well
 you


know
 we've
 got
 a
 an
 amazing
 pool
 of


people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 ask
 questions
 to


get
 advice
 from
 do
 you
 um
 do
 you
 compare


notes
 with
 um
 with
 the
 r
 team
 we
 spent
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 with
 them
 actually


what
 do
 you
 learn
 from
 each
 other
 yeah
 I


think
 the
 sports
 are
 incredibly


different
 and
 incred
 be
 similar
 at
 the


same
 time
 and
 the
 old
 blacks
 have
 done


an
 incredible
 job
 getting
 such
 a
 high
 um


winning
 percentage
 over
 such
 a
 long


period
 of
 time
 and
 just
 continued
 to


build
 those
 those
 systems
 and
 resilience


and
 continue
 to
 evolve
 themselves
 as
 a


as
 a
 rugby
 team
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 been


pretty
 amazing
 to
 to
 see
 how
 they
 they


have
 their
 their
 RS
 and
 their
 flows
 but


they
 always
 seem
 to
 continue
 to
 perform


at
 that
 that
 super
 high
 level
 what
 are


the
 similarities
 just
 seeing
 how
 the


decision-
 making
 process
 works
 um
 you


know
 making
 sure
 all
 the
 athletes
 are


you
 know
 really
 empowered
 to
 to
 get
 the


most
 out
 of
 them
 elv
 but
 then
 you
 also


feed
 into
 the
 team
 at
 a
 a
 really
 high


level
 you
 how
 they
 onboard
 people
 um
 you


how
 they
 build
 resilience
 within
 their


their
 group
 do
 you
 also
 do
 the
 hacker


before


sailing
 I'm
 not
 too
 good
 at
 the
 hacker


to
 be
 honest
 so
 I'm
 more
 try
 and
 relax


into
 my
 day
 I'm
 pretty
 low-key
 person
 so


I
 find
 that
 just
 with
 the
 adrenaline
 of


an
 event
 and
 you
 know
 you've
 got
 to
 go


up
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 find
 a
 good
 level


for
 yourself
 but
 yeah
 it'll
 be
 a
 bit
 too


intense
 for
 me
 one
 place
 where
 you
 where


you're
 not
 relaxed
 is
 your
 view
 on
 on


the
 climate
 and
 and
 the
 state
 of
 the


ocean
 so
 you
 started
 live
 ocean
 with


Blair
 a
 little
 while
 back
 and
 so
 what


tell
 us
 what
 what
 is
 live
 ocean
 yeah


live
 ocean
 is
 a
 marine
 conservation


charity
 that
 Blair
 and
 myself
 founded
 uh


in
 New
 Zealand
 5
 years
 ago
 now
 amazing


looking
 back
 how
 much
 has
 happened


during
 that
 time
 and
 New
 Zealand
 have


the
 the
 fourth
 largest
 ocean
 space
 in


the
 world
 and
 I
 mean
 the
 oceans
 the


thing
 that
 connects
 Nations
 um
 you
 know


it's
 really
 the
 the
 heat
 sink
 of
 the
 the


world
 um
 you
 know
 it
 absorbs
 90%
 of
 the


Heat
 does
 so
 much
 of
 the
 heavy
 lifting


with
 you
 know
 oxygen
 production
 you
 know


if
 you
 start
 talking
 about
 biodiversity


you
 know
 the
 ocean
 really
 where
 a
 lot
 of


that
 is
 left
 on
 the
 planet
 we
 live
 on
 I


mean
 it's
 such
 an
 amazing
 thing
 that


that
 we
 race
 on
 that
 we
 felt
 like
 we


were
 really
 you
 know
 had
 to
 to
 do
 our


pce
 to
 protect
 it
 and
 you
 know
 normally


you'd
 wait
 till
 the
 end
 of
 your
 career


when
 you
 weren't
 too
 busy
 to
 to
 take


that
 on
 but
 you
 know
 when
 we
 went
 and


started
 talking
 to
 the
 science
 community


in
 the
 area
 it
 felt
 like
 the
 issues
 were


were
 too
 urgent
 to
 to
 wait
 and
 now
 it's


been
 a
 really
 cool
 Journey
 what
 does
 the


foundation
 do
 the
 foundation
 takes


promising
 science
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 helps


accelerate
 that
 um
 you
 know
 and


continues
 to
 promote
 the
 Outreach
 so
 we


we
 started
 off
 with
 a
 a
 project
 around


Albatross
 actually
 um
 which
 you
 know


sailed
 around
 the
 world
 in
 an
 ocean
 race


in
 in
 2017
 and
 you
 know
 when
 we're


sailing
 through
 the
 Southern
 Ocean
 you


feel
 pretty
 out
 of
 your
 depth
 you
 know


you're
 on
 the
 small
 boat
 in
 the
 middle


of
 absolutely
 nowhere
 with
 the
 the


weather
 systems
 down
 there
 are
 so


powerful
 and
 there
 these
 Albatross
 just


cruising
 around
 almost
 checking
 you
 out


wondering
 what
 on
 Earth
 you're
 doing


doing
 down
 there
 but
 they
 just
 do
 it
 so


easily
 yeah
 the
 albatross
 Mor
 tell
 a


biodiversity
 and
 and
 how
 much
 the
 that


they
 are
 Sentinal
 species
 so
 if
 they're


struggling
 then
 then
 the
 ocean's


struggling
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we
 chose
 a


species
 to
 to
 track
 that
 have
 been
 um


being
 monitored
 by
 our
 department
 of


conservation
 in
 New
 Zealand
 for
 for
 the


last
 20
 years
 and
 in
 that
 last
 20
 years


the
 the
 breeding
 population
 had
 de
 by
 by


70%
 to
 be
 honest
 they
 have
 no
 Predators


on
 land
 the
 species
 were
 following
 so


they're
 interpreting
 albatrosses
 an


island
 um
 250
 Mi
 off
 the
 Southeastern


corner
 of
 New
 Zealand
 that
 you
 have
 to


get
 a
 permit
 to
 land
 to
 it's
 piss
 free


um
 it's
 a
 very
 isolated
 bit
 of
 bit
 of


the
 world
 um
 but
 yeah
 still
 the
 species


was
 absolutely
 freef
 falling
 so
 now
 it's


um
 scary
 to
 see
 how
 how
 quickly
 things


can
 be
 changing
 in
 a
 negative
 way
 unless


you
 you
 really
 shine
 lot
 on
 the
 issues


no
 there
 some
 really
 great
 work
 you
 do


there
 um
 any
 particular
 motto
 or
 slogan


you
 live
 by
 these
 are
 tough
 questions
 um


no
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 have
 a
 particular
 I


suppose
 motto
 that
 I
 live
 by
 but
 like
 to


be
 relatively
 efficient
 with
 my
 time
 I


like
 to
 never
 be
 afraid
 to
 to
 take
 on
 a


challenge
 um
 never
 be
 afraid
 to
 to
 put


myself
 out
 there
 just
 to
 continue
 to
 to


learn
 and
 improve
 I
 feel
 like
 you've


always
 got
 so
 much
 uh
 you
 can
 learn
 from


people
 you
 can
 absorb
 and
 you
 can
 get


better
 so
 yeah
 for
 me
 that's
 that's


really
 the
 The
 Challenge
 and
 you
 know


I'm
 really
 really
 enjoying
 it
 and
 if
 you


were
 to
 give
 advice
 to
 other
 young


people
 my
 favorite
 bit
 of
 advice
 is
 to


make
 sure
 people
 really
 enjoy
 what
 they


do
 um
 you
 I
 feel
 like
 life
 isn't


massively
 long
 and
 you've
 got
 to
 really


you
 know
 be
 passionate
 about
 what
 you're


doing
 and
 enjoy
 it
 especially
 if
 you're


really
 trying
 to
 get
 ahead
 and
 Excel
 in


that
 field
 because
 you
 know
 everything's


hard
 work
 to
 a
 certain
 extent
 and
 if
 you


really
 enjoy
 what
 you
 do
 it's
 so
 much


easier
 to
 put
 on
 those
 those
 extra
 hours


or
 you
 know
 that
 extra
 little
 project
 or


or
 bits
 and
 pieces
 to
 to
 really
 get


ahead
 and
 and
 push
 that
 area
 forward
 uh


well
 Peter
 uh
 life
 may
 not
 Bel
 long
 but


you
 have
 achieved
 uh
 more
 things
 in
 so


far
 than
 most
 people
 do
 during
 10


lifetimes
 and
 it's
 very
 clear
 that


you're
 enjoying
 it
 so
 big
 thanks
 for


being
 here
 oh
 awesome
 thanks
 for
 having


me
 thanks
