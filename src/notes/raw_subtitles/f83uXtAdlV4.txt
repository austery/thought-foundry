 Stock
 Movers
 Report,
 your
 roundup
 of


companies
 making
 moves
 in
 the
 stock


market,
 harnessing
 the
 power
 of


Bloomberg
 data.


>> I'm
 Carol
 Master
 along
 with
 Isabelle


Lee.
 Let's
 get
 to
 some
 stocks
 on
 the


move.
 Bloomberg
 News
 equities
 reporter


Natalyia
 Kiny
 Javich
 is
 here
 in
 studio


and
 got
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 big
 banks.


They
 were
 definitely
 moving.
 Some
 good,


some
 bad.
 Yes,
 it
 it
 is
 an
 interesting


earning
 season.
 So,
 let's
 start
 with


Wells
 Fargo.
 The
 ticker
 is
 WFC.
 This
 is


the
 best
 performer
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 The


stock
 is
 up
 by
 7%.
 Of
 course,
 this
 came


after
 the
 bank
 raised
 its
 key


profitability
 metric
 known
 as
 target
 for


return
 on
 tangible
 common
 equity
 to
 a


range
 between
 17
 to
 18%
 from
 a
 previous


level
 of
 15.
 Of
 course,
 it
 came
 after


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 removed
 an
 asset
 cap


in
 June
 because
 we
 know
 that
 Wells
 Fargo


was
 restricted
 from
 expanding
 the
 size


of
 its
 uh
 asset
 size.
 So
 now
 it
 is
 a
 big


development.
 However,
 on
 the
 earning


side
 itself,
 we
 saw
 that
 net
 interest


income
 came
 below
 expectations.
 EPS
 and


revenue
 were
 in
 line.
 And
 then
 another


big
 bank
 we
 are
 watching
 is
 of
 course
 JP


Morgan.
 Uh
 the
 ticker
 is
 JPM.
 The
 stock


finished
 the
 trading
 session
 down
 by


almost
 2%.
 Couple
 highlights.
 Of
 course,


we
 saw
 that
 the
 revenue
 was
 driven
 by


investment
 banking
 fees.
 For
 me,
 it's


specifically
 interesting
 because
 I
 cover


the
 IPO
 market
 as
 well.
 We
 saw
 a


recovery,
 but
 of
 course,
 highlights
 from


CEO
 Jamie
 Diamond
 about
 softness
 in
 the


economy,
 labor
 market.
 This
 is
 kind
 of
 a


cockroach
 or
 a
 cockroach.


>> It
 can
 only
 happen
 in
 the
 US.


>> Got
 to
 love
 it.
 If
 you
 don't
 know
 who


we're
 talking
 about,
 just
 check
 out
 the


story
 at
 blindberg.com.


>> What
 about
 Walmart?
 This
 is
 also
 a


really
 big
 American.


>> It
 is
 a
 big
 story.
 Just
 yesterday,


right,
 we
 spoke,
 who
 else
 want
 to


collaborate
 with
 OpenAI?
 And
 here
 we


are.


>> We
 have
 Walmart.
 The
 ticker
 is
 WMT.
 The


stock
 is
 up
 by
 almost
 5%.
 And
 of
 course,


it
 came
 after
 announcement
 that
 the


company
 will
 team
 up
 with
 open
 AI
 and


enable
 shoppers
 to
 uh
 browse
 and
 uh
 buy


products
 on
 chat
 GPT
 and
 of
 course
 it
 is


a
 kind
 of
 big
 push.
 Analysts
 are
 pretty


excited
 about
 that.
 they
 see
 quote


significant
 opportunities.
 Specifically,


UBS
 uh
 analysts
 are
 saying
 that
 and
 D8


division
 Davidson,
 excuse
 me,
 analysts


is
 saying
 that
 it
 it
 is
 actually
 making


the
 case
 for
 Walmart
 to
 be
 a
 winner


among
 all
 traditional
 retailers
 in
 this


kind
 of


>> like
 doesn't
 it
 beg
 the
 question
 like


who's
 next?
 Do
 we
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


get
 a
 ton
 of
 buy
 buttons
 from
 everybody?


Like
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Yes,
 you're
 right.
 I
 I
 this
 is
 something


I
 didn't
 see
 coming
 actually.
 But
 if
 you


think
 about
 it,
 it
 kind
 of
 makes
 sense.


Like,
 yeah,
 of
 course,
 you
 want
 to
 have


a
 AI
 to
 help
 you
 with
 whatever
 your


shopping
 list
 is.
 And
 Matt
 earlier
 from


TV
 made
 the
 case
 that
 he
 even
 uses


Chatty
 for
 recipes.


>> He
 uses
 it
 for
 Yeah,
 he
 totally
 does.


Tim
 does
 the
 same
 thing.
 Like,
 he'll
 be


like,
 "Here's
 what's
 in
 my
 my
 fridge
 or


something
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 Like,


what
 can
 I
 do
 with
 it?"
 I
 love
 it.
 I


love
 playing
 with
 it.
 I've
 used
 it
 a


little
 bit
 for
 work
 and
 stuff,
 but
 it's


kind
 of
 fun.


>> Um,
 all right.
 There's
 a
 company
 I'm
 not


familiar
 with,
 but
 it
 definitely
 was
 on


the
 move
 today.


>> Yes,
 it
 is
 an
 interesting
 story.
 The


company
 is
 called
 Atai
 Life
 Sciences.


The
 ticker
 is
 ATI.


The
 stock
 jumped
 by
 11%
 today.
 This
 is
 a


clinical
 trial
 stage
 uh


biioharmaceutical
 company.
 It
 was
 among


the
 biggest
 movers
 today
 in
 the


pharmaceutical
 space
 across
 other
 uh
 uh


psychedelic
 stocks.
 So
 the
 it
 came
 after


uh


after
 a
 Republican
 state
 senator
 in


North
 Carolina
 said
 that
 the
 state
 could


quote
 lead
 the
 nation
 in
 expanding


military
 veterans
 access
 to
 mental


health
 drugs
 because
 this
 company


specifically
 develops
 uh
 treatments
 for


mental
 health
 diseases.
 This
 is


according
 to
 a
 report
 from
 a
 publication


called
 Marijuana
 Moment.
 So
 we
 do
 see


that
 these
 stocks
 are
 on
 the
 move
 today.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 Nem
 initiated
 coverage


of
 the
 company
 with
 a
 recommendation
 of


buy
 and
 a
 price
 target
 of
 $12.


>> Yeah.
 Not
 a
 company.


>> Almost
 doubling
 today's
 price.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 stock
 finished
 at
 six.


>> 351%
 higher
 this
 year.


>> Is
 that
 crazy?


>> I
 feel
 like
 these
 companies
 they
 can


>> we
 forget
 about
 them
 and
 then
 when
 a
 big


announcement
 comes,
 bam.
