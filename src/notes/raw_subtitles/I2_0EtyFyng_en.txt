for

fore


for


for


for

TV
 the
 79th
 Secretary
 of
 the
 Treasury


Scott
 Besson
 secretary
 Besson
 it's
 good


to
 see
 you
 sir
 joh
 good
 to
 see
 you
 a


warm
 congratulations
 from
 all
 of
 us
 to


you
 quite
 an
 arrival
 from
 what
 was
 it


Little
 River
 South
 Carolina


yes
 it's
 an
 American
 success
 story
 all


in
 America
 to
 the
 office
 of
 Alexander


Hamilton
 with
 some
 unique
 experience
 how


is
 that
 going
 to
 help
 you
 sir
 approach


some
 of
 the
 challenges
 in
 this
 economy


well
 Jonathan
 the
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 for


my
 career
 for
 35
 years
 I've
 been
 sort
 of


sitting
 outside
 the
 the
 room
 with
 my
 ear


up
 against
 the
 door
 or
 trying
 to
 look


over
 the
 transom
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what
 policy
 makers
 should
 do
 or
 going
 to


do
 and
 how
 that
 would
 affect
 the
 markets


now
 I'm
 inside
 the
 room
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 what
 everybody
 outside
 the
 room


expects
 us
 to
 do
 how
 the
 Market's
 going


to
 react
 and
 the
 what
 the
 economic
 and


market
 implications
 are
 shortterm
 but


more
 importantly
 medium-term
 and
 how


that's
 going
 to
 affect
 the
 underlying


economy
 we've
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 discuss
 so


let's
 start
 with
 the
 debt
 Market
 what


people
 expected
 you
 to
 do
 make
 B
 was


changed
 some
 of
 the
 issuance
 for


treasury
 something
 that
 you'd
 said
 back


last
 summer
 about
 then
 secretary
 Yellen


was
 that
 Yellen
 had
 taken
 control
 of
 of


monetary
 policy
 through
 treasury


issuance
 then
 you're
 basically


maintaining
 her
 plans
 can
 you
 help


explain
 that
 help
 us
 understand
 where


you're
 coming
 from
 sure
 so
 the
 I
 the


previous
 administration
 shortened
 some


of
 the
 duration
 and
 we
 haven't
 shortened


it
 further
 we've
 just
 kept
 the
 policy
 in


place
 and
 I
 believe
 over
 the
 medium
 term


it's
 going
 to
 uh
 play
 out
 as
 it
 becomes


clear
 that
 everything
 that
 President


Trump's
 Administration
 is
 doing
 uh
 will


bring
 will
 be
 disinflationary
 we're


going
 to
 bring
 down
 energy
 cost
 we're


going
 to
 bring
 down
 regulation
 um
 what


doge
 is
 doing
 in
 terms
 of
 cost
 cutting


and
 I
 think
 once
 the
 tax
 tax
 cuts
 and


job
 acts
 the
 is
 um
 made
 permanent
 then


you
 know
 we
 can
 have
 a
 revenue
 increase


cost
 decrease
 and
 as
 you
 said
 as
 the


nation's
 top
 Bond
 salesman
 I
 got
 a


pretty
 good
 story
 so
 what's
 the
 medium-


term
 help
 me
 understand
 that
 what
 is
 the


medium-
 term
 and
 then
 once
 you
 see
 all


those
 things
 let's
 say
 those
 Ambitions


become
 reality
 then
 do
 you
 start
 to


think
 about
 Turing
 out
 the
 debt
 uh
 sure


but
 that's
 that's
 a
 long
 way
 off
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 the
 market
 wants


as
 Lisa
 noted
 this
 morning
 that
 the
 and


it's
 to
 see
 someone
 who
 believes
 that


fed
 minutes
 are


exciting
 that
 the
 the
 FED
 said
 that
 they


may
 stop
 their
 balance
 sheet
 runoff
 so


you
 know
 easier
 for
 me
 to
 extend


duration
 when
 I'm
 not
 competing
 with


another
 big
 seller
 so
 when
 do
 you
 think


that
 time
 would
 be
 end
 of
 the
 year
 or


further
 down
 into
 the
 administration's


term
 yeah
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 it's
 going


to
 be
 past
 dependent
 you
 we're
 still


seeing
 sort
 of
 the
 residual
 B
 inflation


that's
 still
 coming
 through
 uh
 and
 I
 I


think
 as
 a
 the
 market
 starts
 to
 realize


what
 we're
 doing
 and
 um
 inflation
 starts


to
 drop
 then
 we
 will
 we
 will
 see
 so
 it's


going
 to
 be
 path
 dependent
 that's
 the


eventual
 goal
 but
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 Signal
 it
 now
 when
 you
 mention


the


for
 for


B
 minutes
 participants
 indicated


yesterday
 that
 one
 of
 the
 problems
 s


they
 had
 was
 they
 were
 waiting
 for
 Trump


policies
 to
 come
 into
 place
 do
 you
 think


that
 those
 policies
 when
 you
 think
 of


tariffs
 potentially
 deportations


immigration
 this
 can
 be
 inflationary
 is


it
 going
 to
 hold
 back
 the
 fed
 from


cutting
 rates
 uh
 well
 to
 the
 extent
 the


team
 transitory
 at
 the
 FED
 is
 still
 the


uh
 has
 any
 credibility
 I
 would
 say
 that


tariffs
 if
 they
 have
 any
 price


adjustments
 are
 the
 most
 transitory


thing
 there
 are
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that


should
 hold
 them
 back
 very
 long
 and
 I
 I


would
 point
 out
 that
 depending
 on
 what


number
 you
 want
 to
 use
 10
 20
 million
 uh


people
 who
 came
 across
 the
 border
 we
 had


the
 worst
 inflation
 in
 40
 years
 when
 we


added
 10
 or
 20
 million
 people
 so
 I'm
 not


sure
 why
 people
 are
 say
 saying
 that
 the


it's
 inflationary
 to
 tell
 them
 to
 go


home
 so
 when
 you
 look
 at
 Team
 transitory


do
 you
 think
 the
 next
 move
 for
 them


would
 be
 a
 cut
 uh
 and
 Marie
 I
 have
 uh


said
 publicly
 that
 I
 will
 talk
 about


what
 the
 FED
 has
 done
 uh
 when
 I
 was


Market
 commentator
 and
 investor
 I
 would


talk
 about
 what
 they
 should
 do
 uh
 now
 I


will
 leave
 it
 to
 them
 and
 Cher
 poell
 and


I
 have
 a
 weekly
 breakfast
 we
 saw
 each


other
 yesterday
 and
 I
 will
 convey
 my


thoughts
 there
 well
 let's
 talk
 about


what
 they
 have
 done
 we
 can
 comment
 on


that
 you
 said
 you're
 willing
 to
 they
 cut


rates
 100
 basis
 points
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 last
 year
 and
 another
 thing


happened
 yields
 at
 the
 long
 end
 Rose


they
 didn't
 decline
 do
 you
 think
 Federal


Reserve
 easing
 contributed
 to
 higher


long
 end
 yields
 well
 well
 Jonathan
 I


would
 just
 say
 the
 point
 of
 cutting


rates
 is
 to
 cut
 rates
 so
 if
 they
 cut


rates
 and
 rates
 went
 up
 then
 there


probably
 was
 the
 uh
 some
 something
 there


um
 I
 I
 thought
 that
 the
 rate
 cut
 in


September
 I
 said
 it
 may
 maybe
 even
 on


your
 show
 here
 that
 it
 it
 was
 oversized


uh
 the
 market
 responded
 but
 now
 we're


seeing
 term
 premium
 come
 back
 down
 so
 uh


you
 know
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens
 from


here
 do
 you
 think
 the
 current
 rate
 right


now
 is
 enough
 to
 bring
 down
 10year


yields
 over
 time
 time
 just
 by
 virtue
 of


being
 restrictive
 again
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


comment
 on
 current
 policy
 I
 am
 curious


you
 talk
 about
 how
 you
 do
 look
 at
 the


10-e
 yield
 every
 single
 day
 I
 love
 that


I
 love
 that
 you're
 the
 top
 Bond
 salesman


in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 I'm
 wondering


are
 you
 expecting
 it
 or
 hoping
 it
 to
 go


down
 from
 here
 is
 that
 necessary
 to


reach
 to
 achieve
 your
 3%
 growth
 Target


well
 what
 what's
 necessary
 are
 the


underlying
 conditions
 so
 the
 underlying


conditions
 that
 we
 we
 need
 for
 yields
 to


come
 down
 for
 growth
 to
 go
 back
 up
 we've


got
 this
 affordability
 crisis
 in
 housing


we've
 got
 an
 affordability
 crisis
 in
 the


auto
 payments
 so
 you
 know
 one
 thing
 that


would
 be
 very
 stimulative
 and
 as


Jonathan
 mentioned
 earlier
 that
 10
 years


come
 down
 or
 rates
 have
 come
 down
 every


week
 since
 Donald
 Trump's
 been
 president


so
 you
 know
 if
 we
 can
 continue
 that
 for


52
 weeks
 that'd
 be
 great
 uh
 and
 it'd
 be


very
 it
 would
 be
 a
 win
 for
 the
 American


people
 which
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 that


is
 our
 goal
 so
 um
 if
 we
 do
 what
 we
 say


we're
 going
 to
 do
 if
 we
 can
 re
 in
 the


budget
 deficit
 if
 we
 have


non-inflationary
 growth
 if
 we
 bring
 down


Energy
 prices
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 now


that
 I
 have
 the
 numbers
 on
 the
 inside


there
 was
 a
 big
 contributor
 to
 this


massive
 inflation
 was
 uh
 regulation
 you


know
 I
 think
 you
 said
 earlier
 this


morning
 uh
 that
 the
 um
 what
 if
 these


things
 CA
 inflation
 you
 know
 some
 as
 an


Marie
 just
 said
 some
 of
 the
 policies


well
 what
 really
 happened
 under
 the


previous
 administration
 was
 you
 created


a
 demand
 shock
 with
 government
 spending


but
 it
 was
 met
 by
 Supply
 constraints
 as


there
 was
 more
 regulation
 and
 Trump
 1.0


we
 created
 a
 demand
 shock
 with
 tax
 cuts


and
 it
 was
 met
 by
 supply
 side
 response


of
 less
 regulation
 so
 you
 know
 the
 Biden


Administration
 created
 this
 inflation


that
 a
 demand
 shock
 and
 constraining


Supply
 is
 the
 ultimate
 recipe
 for


inflation


so


for


for
 fore


and
 now
 you
 want
 to
 cut
 spending
 the


Doge
 program
 let's
 talk
 about
 it
 you've


called
 it
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


audits
 to
 government
 ever
 you
 remember


that
 Clinton
 tried
 something
 similar
 the


National
 Partnership
 for
 Reinventing


government
 how
 different
 will
 this
 be


and
 what
 kind
 of
 cost
 savings
 are
 you


and
 the
 team
 thinking
 about
 yeah
 and


John
 I
 can
 go
 all
 the
 way
 back
 the
 uh


given
 my
 tenure
 in
 the
 business
 I
 can
 go


all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 the
 80s
 to
 the
 grace


commission
 and
 they
 they
 had
 some
 great


the
 ideas
 most
 of
 them
 not
 implemented


uh
 I
 think
 that
 the
 Clint
 Clinton
 Gore


initiative
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 was


academics
 so
 you
 this
 is
 people
 on
 the


ground
 uh
 all
 all
 areas
 of
 government


and
 you
 know
 it's
 moving
 quickly
 and
 I
 I


really
 do
 think
 it's
 unfortunate
 that


it's
 been


lampooned
 and
 the
 uh
 attacked
 the
 way
 it


has
 but
 when
 it's
 being
 attacked
 like


this
 it
 tells
 me
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


entrenched
 interest
 in
 terms
 when
 you're


moving
 people's
 cheese
 they
 they
 don't


like
 it
 and
 it's
 not
 their
 cheese
 it's


the
 American
 people's
 cheese
 well
 how


about
 putting
 some
 of
 that
 cheese
 back


into
 American
 people's
 pockets
 how


inflationary
 would
 those
 $5,000


potential
 Doge
 checks
 be
 that
 the


president
 spoke
 about
 yesterday
 well
 I
 I


think
 again
 that
 if
 we
 are
 bringing
 down


energy
 prices
 if
 we
 are
 uh
 cutting
 the


regulation
 so
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that


it's
 a
 um
 to
 to
 quote
 the
 vice
 president


during
 the
 campaign
 I
 think
 it's


holistic
 and
 I
 think
 that
 um
 it
 it's
 all


kind
 of
 one
 mosaic
 if
 if
 you
 were
 to


inject
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 into
 the
 economy


because
 you
 know
 and
 think
 about
 this


that
 we
 are
 at
 the
 uh
 this
 massive


deficit
 to
 GDP
 6.7
 almost
 7%
 so
 what'll


be
 happening
 on
 one
 side
 you'll
 be


bringing
 down
 that
 spending
 in
 the


economy
 so
 you
 know
 very
 easy
 mental


model
 is
 every
 300
 billion
 is
 about
 1%


of
 GDP
 so
 every
 300
 billion
 that
 doge
 is


able
 to
 save
 could
 you
 put
 that
 back
 in


the
 economy
 into
 people's
 pockets
 one


thing
 potentially
 that
 could
 happen
 and


people
 are
 questioning
 it
 is
 maybe


remarking
 gold
 Elon
 mus
 who's
 leading


Doge
 was
 talking
 about
 maybe
 going
 to


Fort
 Knox
 to
 make
 sure
 those
 gold


reserves
 are
 there
 that
 comes
 under
 your


purview
 do
 you
 have
 any
 plans
 to
 visit


Kentucky
 uh
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 plans
 I


can
 tell
 you
 that
 that
 we
 do
 an
 audit


every
 year
 I
 can
 tell
 tell
 the
 American


people
 on
 on
 camera
 right
 now
 that
 the


there
 was
 a
 report
 September
 30th
 2024


all
 the
 gold
 is
 there
 any
 US
 senator
 who


wants
 to
 come
 and
 visit
 it
 can
 arrange
 a


visit
 through
 our


gold
 was
 your
 biggest
 holding
 when
 you


were
 a
 hedge
 fund
 manager
 before
 you


divested
 to
 become
 the
 treasury


secretary
 so
 you
 know
 the
 value
 of
 where


gold
 is
 right
 now
 versus
 where
 it's


marked
 on
 its
 balance
 sheet
 just
 north


of
 $40
 an
 ounce
 it's
 close
 to
 3,000
 is


it
 under
 consideration
 for
 this


Administration
 to
 revalue
 Gold
 uh
 I


think
 that
 somehow
 when
 I
 we
 were


talking
 about
 the
 Sovereign
 wealth
 fund


and
 I
 said
 monetize
 the
 balance
 sheet
 I


can
 promise
 you
 that's
 not
 what
 I
 had
 in


mind
 so
 it's
 not
 under
 consideration
 not


on
 the
 table
 that's
 not
 what
 I
 had
 in


mind


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Doge
 savings
 that


you
 have
 so
 far
 how
 much
 is
 that
 going


to
 go
 to
 offset
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 tax


extensions
 that
 we
 see
 what
 other


savings
 are
 you
 looking
 at
 that


potentially
 are
 crucial
 well
 again


they're
 they're
 just
 getting
 started
 and


uh
 one
 one
 of
 the
 shocking
 things
 to
 me


has
 been
 you
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 waste


Fraud
 and
 Abuse
 uh
 we
 all
 think
 of
 you


know
 what
 comes
 out
 of
 DC
 we
 think
 of


some
 waste
 and
 fraud
 and
 friction
 costs


cuz
 you
 know
 one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 this


is
 25%
 of
 the
 US
 economy
 flows
 through


Washington
 DC
 so
 if
 we
 can
 cut
 the


friction
 on
 that
 you
 know
 that's
 a
 lot


of
 savings
 uh
 what
 I
 we
 are
 discovering


now
 in
 waste
 Fraud
 and
 Abuse
 there
 may


be
 much
 more
 fraud
 going
 on
 than
 we


thought
 and
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 be


hearing
 about
 that
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks


can
 we
 hear
 about
 it
 now
 uh
 I
 think


you'll
 be
 hear
 about
 it
 on
 the
 coming


weeks
 what
 kind
 of
 fraud
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 what
 kind
 of
 fraud
 have


you
 identified
 uh
 again
 the
 I
 I'd
 refer


you
 to


now
 the
 I'd
 refer
 you
 to
 some
 of
 the


statements
 by
 Lee
 zeldon
 at
 the
 EPA
 okay
