As a 42 year old who's
spent most of my life studying physics,
I must admit
that I had a big misconception.
I believed that every object
has one single trajectory
through space, one single path.
But in this video, I will prove to you
that this is not the case.
Everything is actually exploring
all possible paths all at once.
So let's start with a simple thought
experiment.
Say you're at a beach when all of a sudden
you see your friend
struggling out in the water.
You want to go help them
as quickly as possible.
So which path
should you take to get there?
The shortest path is a straight line,
so you could head directly towards him.
But you can run faster than you can swim,
and this path requires more swimming.
So alternatively,
you could run down the beach
to minimize the
distance through the water.
But now
the total
distance is longer than it needs to be.
So the optimal path,
it turns out, is somewhere in between.
To be precise, it depends on the speeds
at which you can run and swim.
Now, you might recognize this
mathematical relationship because it is
the exact same law that governs light
passing from one medium into another.
So light also takes the fastest
path from point A to point B.
What's weird about this is that as humans,
we can see where we want to go
and then figure out the fastest route.
But light, I mean, how does light know
how to travel
to minimize its journey time?
Now here is where
my misconception comes in.
I shine a laser beam.
The light just goes in one direction.
I throw a ball.
The ball just goes in one direction,
you know?
I would have answered,
there is nothing strange about this.
Light sets off from point A
in some direction.
And then a little while later
it encounters a new medium.
And due to local interactions
with that medium,
it changes direction,
ending up at point B.
If you later find that of all the possible
paths, light took the shortest time
to get from A to B, I wouldn't
think it was optimizing for anything.
I would just think that's what happens
when light obeys local rules.
But now I will prove to you that light
doesn't set out in only one direction.
Instead, it really does explore all possible paths.
And the same is true for electrons
and protons.
All quantum particles.
So the fact that we see things on single,
well-defined trajectories
is, in a way, the most convincing illusion
nature has ever devised.
And the way it works all comes down to a
quantity known as the action.
In a previous video, we showed
how an obscure scientist, Maupertuis,
made an ad hoc proposal
that there should be a quantity
called action, which he defined
as mass times velocity times distance.
And he claimed that everything
always follows the path that minimizes
the action.
Hamilton later showed that this action
is equivalent to the integral
over time of kinetic energy
minus potential energy.
Action was useful and an alternative way
of solving physics problems,
especially when Newton's laws
get too cumbersome.
But then, around the turn of the 20th
century, action showed up at the heart
of a scientific revolution:
the birth of quantum mechanics.
It all started with electric
lighting in Germany.
Think about what it's like in the 1890s,
right?
Electricity being more widely available,
at least in urban sectors.
And things like, you know, light bulbs.
They were new.
They were literally the hot new thing.
Germany wanted to replace all their gas
street lights with electric light bulbs.
So an important question was
how do you maximize
the visible light
given off by a hot filament?
Scientists at a German research
institute, the PTR, studied
how much light different materials
emitted as a function of temperature.
At low temperatures, each material
gave off its own characteristic spectrum,
mostly in the infrared,
but above about 500°C
all materials started to glow
in the same way,
with an almost identical
distribution of light.
The hotter the object,
the more energy was emitted
at every wavelength, and the peak
of the distribution shifted to the left.
But they still didn't understand
how it worked theoretically.
So that was sort of the next step, right?
If you can understand how it works
theoretically,
then you can use that theory
to potentially design your products.
They started by imagining
the simplest object possible,
one that would absorb all light
that falls onto it
and perfectly emit radiation
based on its temperature.
They came up with a hole in a metal cube.
This hole is a perfect blackbody
because any light that shines onto
it will go straight in, bounce
around inside, and eventually be absorbed.
But this also makes it a perfect emitter.
Any radiation inside the cube can escape
through the hole unimpeded.
Theorists reasoned that electrons
in the walls of the cube
would wiggle around,
emitting electromagnetic waves.
These waves
would then bounce off the other walls.
When you have two waves
of the same frequency,
where one travels to the right
and the other to the left,
they can interfere in such a way
that they create places
where there's no wave amplitude
those are nodes, and places where there is
maximum wave amplitude,
the anti nodes. Waves like this are called
standing waves
because they don't really move left
or right
and inside a cavity,
given enough time and reflections.
It is only these standing waves
that survive.
All the other ones just cancel out.
So a sort of order emerges from the chaos.
In two dimensions, standing waves
look something like this.
For shorter wavelengths
or higher frequencies, you can fit more
and more different vibrational modes.
Inside this cube,
so that in three
dimensions, the total number of modes
is proportional to frequency cubed,
or one over lambda cubed.
The expectation was
there would be more and more waves
inside the cube,
the shorter the wavelength.
This led directly to the Rayleigh-Jeans law.
At longer wavelengths.
It matched the experimental data
pretty well,
but at shorter wavelengths
the theory diverged from experiment.
In fact, it predicted
that at the shortest wavelengths,
an infinite amount of energy
would be emitted.
This, for obvious reasons, became known
as the ultraviolet catastrophe.
The person to solve
this problem was Max Planck,
but Planck almost didn't
make it into studying physics,
because when he was 16 years old,
he went up to his professor and asked him,
well,
maybe I could do a career in physics.
To which his professor responded
that he'd better find another field
to do research in, because physics
was essentially a complete science.
You know, there was just a few tiny
little problems that they had to clean up.
But besides that, it was over.
But Planck didn't listen.
By 1897, he was a professor himself,
and for the next three years he struggled
to find a theoretical explanation
for blackbody radiation.
He tried approach after approach,
but no matter what, he tried.
Nothing worked.
He said I was ready to sacrifice
every one of my previous convictions
about physical laws.
Then, in a quote ‘act of desperation’,
he did something
no one had thought to try.
According to classical physics,
the energy of an electromagnetic wave
depends only on its amplitude,
not its wavelength or frequency.
And it could take any arbitrary value.
So any atom could emit
any wavelength of light
with an arbitrarily
small amount of energy.
But Planck tried restricting the energy
so that it could only come in multiples
of a smallest amount.
A quantum.
And he made the energy of
one quantum
directly proportional to its frequency.
E equals hf, where h is just a constant.
Think about what this does
to the radiation coming from the blackbody
at a given temperature.
The atoms in the cavity
have a range of energies.
Some have a little bit.
A few have a lot, and most of their energy
somewhere in between.
For long wavelength
low frequency radiation, the energy
HF of one quantum is small,
so all of the atoms have enough energy
to emit this wavelength,
and the spectrum matches
the really gene's prediction very well.
But at shorter
wavelengths, higher frequencies,
the energy of a quantum increases.
And now not all of the atoms have
enough energy to emit that wavelength.
This is why experiment diverges
from the classical prediction.
The spectrum peaks
and then starts to fall because fewer
and fewer atoms have enough energy
to emit one quantum of that radiation.
And there comes a point
when none of the atoms have enough energy
to emit one quantum.
So here the spectrum must drop to zero.
With this approach, Planck got a new formula
for the radiation spectrum.
Now all that was left for him to do
was to tune the parameter h.
And when he did this just right,
he got his formula to match up
perfectly with experiment.
But he was sort of troubled
by his own formula because to him
it was just a mathematical trick.
He had no clue why it worked.
It was purely formal.
And most importantly,
he had no clue what this H represented.
I mean, he had introduced a new
physical constant without any reason.
He wrote a theoretical interpretation
had to be found at any cost,
no matter how high.
So from that moment
on, he dedicated himself to finding one.
He later reflected that after some weeks
of the most strenuous work of my life,
light came into the darkness
and a new undreamed of perspective
opened up before me.
He introduces
what we now call Planck's constant,
and it has the units of action. Planck's
constant, h
is a quantum of action.
Planck later proposed that any time
any change happened in nature,
it would be some whole multiple
of this quantum of action.
So it's kind of spooky, this breakthrough
that starts the ball rolling toward
quantum theory brings action in not energy
and not force. Action. Gives you a hint.
At first, the quantum of action
got little attention.
That is, until a 26 year old patent clerk
came on the scene.
In 1905, Albert
Einstein claimed that Planck's theory
wasn't just a mathematical trick.
It was telling us
that light actually comes in discrete
packets,
or photons, each with an energy HF.
Einstein used this insight
to explain the photoelectric effect
how light can eject electrons from metal,
but only when
the frequency is high enough.
If the frequency is too low,
no electrons will be emitted
regardless of the intensity.
The idea of quantization spread.
Eight years later,
Niels Bohr was trying to understand
how an atom is stable
if it has a positive charge in the center
and negative electrons whizzing around it.
Why don't they just spiral
into the nucleus, radiating their energy
as they go?
And what he wants to do is,
he says there's something fishy
about something being discrete
that seems to be the new ambiguous weirdo
lesson of the new quantum of action. Bohr
realizes that as the electron
goes around the nucleus,
it has an angular momentum.
Mass times velocity times radius.
So angular momentum
has the same units as action.
And so what he decides to do is discretize
the orbital angular momentum.
For no good reason
he says, let me slap that on and say,
and imagine the electron can only be in
one unit, two units,
three units of the same quantity H.
And because it's talking about motion
in a circle, the factors two pi come in.
So is really nh over two pi,
what we now call an h bar.
This comes out of nowhere.
There seems like
absolutely no good reason why
angular momentum should be quantized.
But by doing it, Bohr finds the correct
energy levels of the hydrogen atom.
When an electron jumps from a higher orbit
to a lower one, the energy difference
is given off as a photon
of a particular color of light.
Exactly reproducing the hydrogen spectrum.
And that was a pretty startling thing
to have fall out.
I think that really was compelling.
Take some quantity with the unit of action
and apply some, again, kind of ad hoc,
discretization or quantization to it.
Now, although it worked
spectacularly well,
no one can make sense of it.
That is until 11 years later.
For his PhD,
Louis de Broglie was contemplating
the recent discoveries in physics.
And his big insight was that if light
could be both a wave and a particle,
then maybe matter
particles could also be waves.
He proposed that everything.
Electrons, basketballs, people,
absolutely everything has a wavelength.
And he defined this wavelength
analogously to light as Planck's
constant,
divided by the particles momentum or
mass times velocity.
Now, if an electron is a wave,
the only way it could stay bound
to a nucleus in an atom is
if it exists as a standing wave.
That requires
that a whole number of wavelengths
fit around the circumference of the orbit.
You could have one wavelength
or two wavelengths or three, and so on.
So the circumference two pi
r must be equal
to some multiple n times the wavelength.
We can sub in de Broglies expression
for the wavelength to get the two pi
r equals NH over mv,
but we can rearrange this to get the mvr.
The angular momentum
is equal to NH over two pi.
That is
precisely Bohr's quantized
angular momentum condition.
But now we have a good physical reason
why it's quantized.
Because electrons are waves
and they must exist as standing
waves to be bound in atoms
because they want to have constructive
interference, have a stable orbit back.
That's pretty good.
You get a dissertation out of that.
That's pretty good.
It is this wave nature of quantum objects.
That means they no longer
have a single path through space.
Instead,
they must explore all possible paths.
Now, I have thought about
and taught the double slit experiment
hundreds of times
without fully realizing this implication.
In the double slit experiment.
I feel like the mental thing
that I'm doing in my head is like, okay,
well, the beam is not perfectly straight,
and of course it's going to intersect
both of those slits because they're really
close together. You know?
But then
I heard this story about a professor
teaching the double slit experiment,
and it makes everything so clear.
So the professor starts by explaining
the setup.
Electrons are fired one at a time
through two slits
to be detected at a screen.
Now, because you can't say for certain
which slit the particle went through,
quantum mechanics tells us
it must go through both at the same time.
So to get the probability of finding
a particle somewhere on the screen,
you simply add up
the amplitude of the wave
going through one slit, with the amplitude
of the wave going through the other slit
and square it.
But that's when a student raised his hand.
What if you add a third slit?
Well, you just add up the amplitudes
of the waves
going through each of the three slits,
and you can work out the probability.
The professor wanted to
continue,
but then the student interjected again.
What if you add a fourth slit and a fifth?
The professor, who is now clearly losing
his patience, replies, I think it's clear
to the whole class that you just add up
the amplitudes from all the slits.
It's the same for six, seven, etc.
but now the bold student
pressed his advantage.
What if I make it infinite slits
so that the screen disappears?
And then I add a second screen
with infinite slits
and a third and a fourth.
The student's point was clear.
Even when we're not doing
a double slit experiment,
when it's just light or particles
traveling through empty space,
they must be exploring all possible paths.
Because this is exactly how the math
would work if you had infinite screens,
each with infinite slits.
You have to add up the amplitude
from each slit.
That's just the way it works.
According to the story,
the student was Richard Feynman,
and while the story is made
up, the logic is flawless.
Because if you believe
in the double slit experiment
that you can't tell which of the two slits
the particle went through,
then you have to consider the possibility
that it goes through both.
By that same logic, any time
any particle goes from place
one to place two.
You have to consider
all the possible paths
it could take to get there, including ones
that go faster than the speed of light,
including ones that go back in time,
and including ones that go
to the other side of the moon and back.
I feel like I can't go to the sun
and back.
You have to restrict it
to be local, right?
So the math doesn't do that.
I mean, you could see that
just in the double slit experiment, right?
And we'll do light because then there's
no funky business with the speed.
If you're going to say like,
this path interferes with this
path and these distances
are different, right.
And so clearly
they can’t have the same speed.
So you need to consider
paths that have different speeds.
Feynman's way of doing quantum mechanics
suggests that anything going from
one place to another is connected
in every possible way.
And the internet is kind of like that too
connecting us to anything,
anywhere, at any time.
At least in theory,
there are still artificial barriers
like geo blocks and country restrictions
that block off parts of the internet.
But fortunately, there's today's sponsor,
NordVPN, which can help knock down
those barriers.
Just connect to one of their thousands of
servers, for example, this one in the US.
And it looks as if you're accessing
the internet from there.
The team and I 
travel a lot to make these videos,
and using a VPN is a game changer.
It allows us to access the news sites 
and articles we need, no matter
where in the world we are.
And personally, I also love that NordVPN
allows me to stay up

And now let's get back to Feynman's crazy
way of doing quantum mechanics.
So according to Feynman,
any time a particle, a photon, or even a
macroscopic object moves from point 1 to point 2,
it has some chance to take any path.
And as preposterous as it might sound.
He found that we need to include
all these paths in our calculation,
where each path is weighted the same.
So why
then, do we not see all those crazy paths?
Well, that's because we still need
to add up their amplitudes.
For simplicity,
imagine we only have three paths.
Then here's what we're going to do.
First, let's take this one.
When the particle wave starts
following it, we start a stopwatch.
It goes around and around very fast,
and when it gets to the end point,
we hit stop.
We'll do the same for the other two paths.
And then we add up
the arrows, square the result.
And that is
then proportional to the probability
the particle took those paths
to get there.
In this case
the arrow and square are pretty small, so
the probability of the particle going from
1 to 2 using these paths is small.
Compare that with these three paths.
For example.
Well now the arrow is much larger.
And this is important.
The larger the resulting arrow, the higher
the probability of that event happening.
Now in these examples the stopwatch is not
actually measuring time.
Instead it measures
something called the phase.
Just as in the double slit experiment,
when a wave takes a different path
from point 1 to 2, it will end up there
with a different phase.
And this phase is what determines
the amplitude of the wave at that point.
Mathematically, we can write the amplitude
our stopwatch as e to the I phi,
where phi is the phase.
As the particle wave follows a path,
its phase increases.
Winding the vector around.
So now the big question is how much
does the phase change for each path?
Well, to answer that, imagine
we split up the path into many tiny
sections, each one
so small that it's effectively straight.
Then in each
section, the particle wave goes
a distance delta x and a time delta t,
and the increase in phase
is easy to compute.
It just depends on the wavelength
and frequency of the wave.
To find the total increase in phase
for the whole path,
we just add up all the little phase
increases of all the individual sections.
But we can sub in lambda equals
h over mv from de Broglie,
and using e we can sub in for frequency.
We can also simplify by writing h over two
pi as h bar.
To get this expression.
Then we can take delta t to the right.
And if we make delta
t infinitesimally small,
then we can replace this
sum with an integral.
But now Dx by Dt is just velocity.
So we can write this as m b squared.
Now we know that in the simplest case
the total energy
e is just kinetic plus potential energy.
And subbing that in we're left
with the integral
over time of kinetic energy
minus potential energy.
But wait a second.
That is just the classical action.
So it's action that determines
how fast the stopwatch turns.
As the particle moves along a trajectory,
its action increases,
and that is what increases the phase.
And what's important to note is that h
bar is tiny.
It's about ten to the -34 joule seconds,
which is way
smaller than the action
of any everyday object.
That means the phase of ordinary objects
on ordinary paths
spins around zillions of times,
eventually pointing
in some random direction.
If you consider a slightly different path,
the action may be slightly different
say 0.01 joule seconds different.
That doesn't seem like much,
but divide it by h bar
and the arrow will spin around
ten to the 32 more times.
So again, it will just point
in some random direction.
This is what
happens
to almost all of the possible paths.
So when you add up the phases,
they just cancel out.
They destructively interfere.
The only exception is for the paths
closest
to the path of least action,
because these paths are at a minimum.
So if you make tiny changes to the path
to first order,
the action doesn't change.
And so for other paths that are very close
to the path of least action,
their arrows point
in basically the same direction.
They constructively interfere.
And that is why those are the paths
we see.
This explains how light knows where to go.
I mean, it doesn't.
It just explores all possible paths,
but the past we end up seeing are the ones
that interfere constructively.
And those are the paths of least action.
So really,
this is how classical mechanics emerges
from quantum mechanics.
It's why a ball follows the trajectory
it does, and how planets orbit the sun.
They don't really have a precise
trajectory.
Instead, everything explores
all possible paths.
It's just that massive particles
have large actions compared to hbar,
so that only paths extremely close
to the true path of least action survive.
Which is why they're much more particle
like.
If you go to much smaller particles
like electrons or photons,
the actions are much smaller,
and so there's more of a spread
in which trajectories
they actually end up taking.
Now, you might say,
I still don't believe you,
but Casper has this incredible demo
that should convince you 100%
that this is really how the world works.
To do it, I've taken a light,
a mirror and a camera.
Now there are infinitely many paths
that the light could take.
And according to Feynman,
we have to add the contributions of each them.
Including paths that go like this.
Now, you might say he's crazy.
I'm not crazy. That's what happens.
Another possibility is I could come here
and go.
Or it could come here and go.
Or it could come
where you'd like it to come and go.
And it can go over here
and go and so on and so on.
And these are all possibilities.
And every single one of these paths
has their own little arrow.
So what we can do is we can look at all
those arrows and see where they line up.
And so if I turn on this light,
that's exactly where you see it reflects
that at the angle of incidence
is equal to the angle of reflection.
But now what I'm going to do
is I'm going to cover up that spot
so that we no longer
see the light reflect.
And then I'm going to prove
that really Feynman is right.
That really light
also goes like this.
It's just that most of the time,
those effects are cancelled out.
Now that sounds impossible, right?
But let's zoom in to this tiny piece
right here.
Then we see all these different paths
and all the arrows just go around
and around in circles.
So when you add them up,
they all just cancel out.
But what if I cover up about half of them
like so.
Well, now when I add up those arrows you
suddenly do see a large resulting arrow.
And so if I can somehow cover up
this mirror in many, many tiny strips,
then I should be able to get the light
to reflect like this.
And I can do that with this piece of foil
right here on this piece of foil.
There are about a thousand lines
per millimeter, and that should be enough
to get this effect.
So let me turn off the lights.
So let's see
I'm going to turn it on in 321.
We see it.
That is so cool.
It actually looks a lot weirder
than I was expecting it to.
I was expecting more like, one spot,
but there's many, many spots
where it's reflecting.
Oh, okay. Okay.
And just to show,
I haven't been cheating you, right
underneath is my finger.
And even with the light
on, you know, we see the light reflect.
And if we remove the cover,
then what do we see?
Yeah, we see exactly the normal reflection
where it's always supposed to go,
which is right there.
And then we've got
now all these extra reflections,
all these extra bits
where the pattern just lines up.
So very, very cool.
When I was talking about this
with a friend, actually,
he said, yeah,
but you're using a diffraction grating.
That's kind of like cheating.
You get all these other reflections
right now
and this light is just
going in all directions.
And so there's one other thing.
I've been super, super curious to try.
I also want to do this with a laser
where I shine the laser right next to it.
And then if light does take every possible
path, we should also see it
come off here.
It probably shouldn't work.
I actually have a laser right over here
and we can see when I shine it.
It really does.
Just go to one spot
and you can see where that spot is.
It's right over there, which is about the
same place where we had our reflection.
And you can also see right now if
we look at this view that you cannot see
the laser light at all.
Right.
Like I could see the laser, but I have to
bring it out all the way over here.
And then I'm able to sort of
see the light.
But if I just put it up here,
you can see the reflection.
Now, what I'm going to do next
is I'm going to put
this foil, this magic foil,
and I'm going to put it over here
and we can turn off this.
And now let's see what happens
when I turn on the laser.
Wait wait wait wait.
No way,
no way.
It works.
It works. Wait. What?
Look where the laser is going.
Oh, my God, it actually works.
What? What?
This is definitely the coolest demo
I've ever done.
So what I was doing is I was holding
the laser, and I can show you right now.
I was shining it down, like, this way off.
And you could still see it reflect.
But if I take this away, it disappears.
And if I put this back, it appears
so that it shows really that we cannot
get rid of the area which gives zero
that it really is canceling out.
And if we do clever things to it,
we can demonstrate the reality of the
reflections from this part of the mirror.
So light and by extension,
everything really does
explore all possible paths.
It's just that most of the time
the crazy paths destructively interfere.
That's because the actions of nearby paths
change rapidly.
Now, I've studied physics
for most of my life,
and I feel like I never really appreciated
how important action
and the principle of least action are.
But now I think I finally get it.
And I finally get why.
If you ask theoretical physicists
what they're working
on, they'll rarely talk about energy
or forces.
Most of the time,
they'll talk about action.
Nobody in particle physics approaches
particle physics
from a viewpoint other than least action.
But we teach physics historically,
and no least action
is almost like the new kid on the block
for understanding physics.
And so, yeah, we build up to it.
But in reality,
I think life's a lot easier once
you realize this underlying principle,
because when you do,
then all you have to do is write down
the correct Lagrangian
so you get the right action and out come
the laws of physics.
So you've got a separate Lagrangian
for classical mechanics,
for special relativity,
for electrodynamics, and so on.
It's a single mathematical framework
that, once you've learned it,
then you can apply it in different places
in exactly the same way.
The hunt
for the theory of everything, right.
The thing that will encompass

Because we can
we can sticky tape things together,
but we don't know if that's the proper
mathematical structure.
So that's what people are hunting for.
