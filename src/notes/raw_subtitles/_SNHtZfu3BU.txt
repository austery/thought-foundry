From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Rachel


Abrams
 and
 this
 is
 the
 daily.


Early
 Monday
 morning,
 thousands
 of


people
 had
 already
 gathered
 in
 what's


become
 known
 as
 hostage
 square
 in
 Tel


Aviv.


>> So
 happy
 right
 now.
 I
 stayed
 awake
 all


night
 just
 to
 see
 it
 everything.
 It's


amazing
 that
 everybody's
 coming
 back.


And
 news
 broke
 that
 the
 first
 group
 of


hostages
 had
 returned
 to
 Israel,


starting
 in
 exchange
 for
 Palestinian


prisoners
 and
 detainees
 that
 was


expected
 to
 begin
 later
 in
 the
 day.


Over
 the
 past
 few
 days,
 the
 world
 has


seen
 dramatic
 scenes
 unfold
 from
 Israel


and
 Gaza.


In
 Gaza,
 thousands
 of
 Palestinians
 are


returning
 to
 their
 homes
 and
 their


neighborhoods,
 and
 they're
 seeing


firsthand
 the
 devastation
 that
 2
 years


of
 war
 has
 brought.


[Applause]


>> As
 international
 journalists
 continue
 to


wait
 for
 access
 to
 the
 strip,


[Music]


[Music]


[Applause]


Today
 I
 talk
 with
 families
 of
 hostages


and
 other
 Israelis
 in
 hostage
 square


about
 this
 long
 anticipated
 moment
 and


also
 with
 my
 colleague
 Isabel
 Kersner


about
 why
 the
 hostages
 have
 been
 so


pivotal
 in
 the
 efforts
 to
 end
 the
 war.


It's
 Monday,
 October
 13th.


[Music]


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 we
 welcome
 you
 to


Vanura
 International
 Airport
 here
 in
 Tel


Aiv.
 And
 our
 arrival
 time
 is


approximately
 9.
 As
 the
 ceasefire
 took


effect
 in
 Gaza,
 I
 flew
 to
 Israel
 with


daily
 producer
 Claire
 Tennisceter
 to
 ask


people
 how
 they're
 feeling
 and
 what


they're
 thinking.
 So,
 we
 just
 got
 off


the
 plane.
 We
 haven't
 even
 been
 walking


maybe
 5
 minutes.
 And
 all
 along
 this
 very


brightly
 lit
 hallway
 are
 pictures
 of
 the


hostages.


And
 within
 minutes
 of
 arriving,
 we


started
 seeing
 reminder
 after
 reminder


of
 the
 remaining
 hostages
 in
 Gaza.
 They


list
 the
 ages
 of
 the
 hostages
 on
 some
 of


these
 posters
 and
 some
 of
 them
 are


crossed
 out
 with
 new
 ages
 as
 they've
 I


guess
 gotten
 older.


>> This
 guy
 34
 crossed
 out
 35
 crossed
 out


now
 it
 says
 36.
 So
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 dropped


off
 our
 luggage
 we
 went
 straight
 to


what's
 become
 the
 epicenter
 of
 the
 push


to
 return
 the
 hostages
 to
 Israel.
 A


place
 known
 as
 hostage
 square.


[Music]


It's
 a
 concrete
 public
 plaza
 between
 an


art
 museum
 and
 a
 public
 library.
 and


it's
 across
 the
 street
 from
 the
 Israeli


military's
 headquarters.


And
 in
 the
 weeks
 and
 months
 following


October
 7th,
 this
 place
 developed
 into
 a


sort
 of
 living
 interactive
 memorial
 to


the
 hostages
 that
 were
 taken
 on
 that


day.
 What's
 going
 on
 over
 in
 this?


>> So,
 this
 is
 uh
 actually
 like
 a
 little


synagogue.
 It's


>> there
 are
 big
 white
 canvas
 tents.
 Some


of
 them
 are
 for
 shade.
 Some
 of
 them
 are


sort
 of
 information
 booths.
 uh
 the
 tent


of
 prayer
 and
 good
 deeds,


>> t-shirts,
 hats,
 flags,


>> and
 there
 are
 little
 pop-up
 stores


selling
 t-shirts
 and
 books
 and
 pins,


>> the
 yellow
 ribbons,
 and
 uh


>> but
 the
 whole
 space
 has
 become
 a
 kind
 of


remembrance
 area.


>> Can
 you
 tell
 us
 what
 you're
 doing?


>> I
 write
 a
 message
 for
 the
 for
 the


hostages.


>> Every
 square
 inch
 of
 this
 place
 seems


like
 it
 has
 a
 photo
 of
 a
 hostage
 or
 a


message
 for
 them
 or
 some
 kind
 of


momento.
 And
 there
 are
 other
 things
 that


feel
 very
 specific
 to
 this
 place
 and
 to


this
 war.


[Music]


>> There's
 a
 piano
 that
 anybody
 can
 come
 up


and
 play
 because
 one
 hostage
 loved
 to


play
 the
 piano.


>> Can
 you
 describe
 what
 we're
 looking
 at?


>> It's
 the
 remaking
 of
 the
 tunnel.


>> And
 there's
 even
 kind
 of
 an
 interactive


artistic
 replica
 of
 a
 Hamas
 tunnel
 where


the
 hostages
 are
 believed
 to
 be
 held.


I
 remember
 the
 tunnel
 from
 the
 last
 time


I
 was
 in
 Israel
 over
 the
 summer
 when
 it


felt
 so
 different.
 There
 was
 no
 hostage


deal
 in
 sight.
 The
 mood
 was
 somber
 and


despondent,
 angry.
 But
 now
 coming
 back,


>> um
 we're
 very,
 very,
 very
 happy.
 This


war
 is
 coming
 to
 an
 end.
 And
 we're
 just


>> The
 mood
 was
 optimistic
 and
 people
 were


excited.


>> We're
 so
 happy.
 So
 we
 celebrate.
 So
 we


are
 offering
 a
 free
 cake
 for
 everyone.


>> Free
 cake.


>> Yeah.


The
 other
 remarkable
 difference,


>> we
 really
 have
 to
 thank
 America
 for
 the


the
 deal,
 especially
 Donald
 Trump,


>> was
 that
 there
 were
 outpours
 of


gratitude
 for
 President
 Trump
 and
 his


role
 in
 brokering
 the
 hostage
 deal.


>> Can
 you
 tell
 me
 what
 your
 sign
 says?


>> Thank
 you,
 President
 Trump.
 Because
 we


want
 him
 to
 know
 that
 we
 are
 thanking


him
 from
 the
 bottom
 of
 our
 hearts.


>> The
 square
 is
 where
 the
 families
 of
 the


hostages
 have
 come
 since
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 war,
 demanding
 that
 the
 military


and
 the
 government
 bring
 their
 loved


ones
 home.
 And
 it's
 also
 where
 thousands


of
 supporters
 and
 protesters
 have
 come


to
 weekly
 rallies
 to
 show
 solidarity
 and


support
 for
 those
 families.


And
 so
 after
 we
 spent
 some
 time
 taking


in
 the
 scene,
 we
 asked
 a
 few
 family


members
 to
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 how
 they


were
 feeling
 just
 hours
 before
 the
 final


hostages
 were
 supposed
 to
 come
 home.


>> Tell
 us
 who
 you
 are
 and
 why
 you're
 here


today.


>> I'm
 the
 brother-in-law
 of
 held
 hostage


for
 two
 years
 now.
 I'm
 here.
 We
 met


Mosha
 Levie
 in
 the
 lobby
 of
 the
 library


along
 the
 square
 where
 families
 of


hostages
 sometimes
 go
 to
 get
 away
 from


the
 crowds


>> and
 it
 was
 very
 important
 for
 the


family.


>> Mosha
 was
 wearing
 a
 t-shirt
 with
 a


picture
 of
 his
 brother-in-law
 Omry


holding
 up
 one
 of
 his
 two
 young


daughters
 in
 the
 air.


>> Omri
 has
 two
 young
 daughters.
 They
 were


held
 captive
 themselves
 on
 that
 day
 with


my
 sister
 luckily
 rescued
 and
 um
 hoping


that
 this
 will
 end.
 I
 just
 arrived


yesterday
 with
 my
 sister
 Lishai
 from
 DC.


That's
 where
 we
 got
 the
 good
 news
 and
 we


rushed
 back
 here
 and
 I'm
 very
 excited
 to


finally
 conclude
 this
 chapter.


>> When
 you
 think
 of
 Omri,
 do
 you
 have
 a


image
 that
 comes
 to
 mind?


>> Omri
 for
 me
 is
 always
 going
 to
 be


the
 smiling
 man
 who
 made
 my
 sister
 happy


after
 difficult
 years.
 It's
 the
 love
 of


her
 life.
 That's
 what
 I
 have
 in
 my
 mind.


You
 know,
 the
 the
 smiling
 face,
 the


bashful
 eyes,
 and
 and
 the
 heart,
 these


this
 big
 heart
 that
 entered
 our
 family.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 guess,
 what
 do
 you
 think


Omry's
 the
 first
 thing
 Omry
 will
 want
 to


do
 is
 when
 he
 gets
 home.


>> No,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 suppose
 what
 he


wants
 to
 do.
 He
 didn't
 have
 a
 choice
 for


two
 years.
 And
 um
 ever
 since
 we
 received


the
 news,
 our
 focus
 is
 now
 on


preparations


from
 small
 things
 like
 preparing
 a
 bag


to


>> a
 bag


>> a
 bag
 for
 a
 muri
 because
 when
 he


arrives,
 he
 would
 want
 to
 see
 wants
 to


wear
 something
 that
 is
 not
 what


terrorists
 forced
 him
 to
 wear.


[Music]


>> Have
 you
 thought
 about
 the
 first
 thing


you
 want
 to
 say
 to
 him?


just
 a
 hug.


>> Yeah.


[Music]


>> And
 um
 and
 primarily
 I
 just
 want
 to
 see


my
 sister
 and
 nieces
 hug
 him.
 I'm
 I'm


not
 important
 for
 that.
 I
 hope
 they'll


have
 that
 moment


and
 I
 hope
 it
 will
 be
 the
 most
 beautiful


moment
 in
 their
 life.


[Music]


Family
 members
 like
 Mosha
 are
 in
 so
 many


different
 situations.
 Some
 of
 them
 are


waiting
 for
 hostages
 they
 know
 are


alive.
 For
 others,
 they
 don't
 know.


They're
 uncertain.
 And
 it's
 unclear
 how


much
 hope
 they
 should
 have,
 but
 still


they
 hope
 to
 be
 on
 the
 cusp
 of
 some
 kind


of
 ending.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 us.
 It's
 a


difficult
 day.


>> Another
 person
 we
 met
 at
 Hostage
 Square


who
 had
 a
 family
 member
 go
 missing


during
 the
 war
 was
 Ruby
 Hen.


>> I'm
 a
 New
 Yorker,
 grew
 up
 in
 Flatbush,


and
 I
 met
 my
 wife
 in
 Israel
 and
 we


decided
 to
 have
 a
 home
 here.


>> Ruby
 and
 his
 wife
 raised
 their
 three


kids
 in
 Israel,
 but
 would
 frequently


travel
 to
 the
 US.
 My
 eldest
 inherited
 my


love
 for
 the
 New
 York
 Knicks
 and
 he
 ties


being
 the
 middle
 son,
 the
 more


rebellious
 one.
 He
 decided
 to
 be
 a


Celtics
 fan
 for
 the
 love
 of
 God.
 I
 don't


know
 how
 that
 happened,
 but
 I
 feel
 that


I
 failed
 as
 a
 father
 because


>> and
 when
 the
 war
 broke
 out,
 one
 of
 his


sons,
 it
 the
 one
 with
 the
 rebellious


streak
 was
 performing
 his
 mandatory


military
 service.
 and
 he
 unlike
 his
 uh


elder
 sibling
 that
 went
 to
 a
 technology


unit
 uh
 he'd
 of
 course
 decided
 to
 do


something
 totally
 different
 and
 he


wanted
 to
 go
 into
 combat
 and
 he
 joined


the
 tanks
 division
 and
 he
 on
 that
 fatal


October
 7th
 was
 uh
 on
 uh
 the
 board
 of


Gaza
 at
 a
 base
 called
 Nahal
 Oz
 Oz
 which


is
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 Gaza


Strip
 and
 they


were
 ambushed.
 They
 got
 hit
 by
 a
 few


anti-
 tank
 missiles
 and
 the
 tank
 was


neutralized
 and
 we
 were
 totally
 in
 the


dark.
 Monday
 we
 went
 to
 the
 missing


people
 command
 center
 that
 was
 put


together
 by
 the
 uh
 police
 and
 they
 said


well
 he's
 missing
 in
 action
 meaning
 no


one
 is
 able
 to
 identify
 him
 physically


standing
 next
 to
 him.
 we
 wasn't
 in
 one


of
 the
 hospitals


and
 a
 few
 days
 after
 we
 uh
 got
 notified


that
 he
 is
 indeed
 a
 hostage
 in
 Gaza


and
 we're
 sitting
 there
 and
 uh
 okay
 do


you
 have
 anything
 else
 to
 tell
 us?
 Where


is
 he
 now?
 Oh,
 we
 don't
 know.
 Okay,
 then


we're
 doing


>> So
 they
 waited
 hoping
 for
 a
 positive


signated


>> desperate
 for
 information
 on
 how
 their


son
 was
 doing.
 In
 March
 24,


uh,
 we
 got
 another
 knock
 on
 the
 door.


>> Then
 a
 few
 months
 later,


>> Ruby
 got
 a
 very
 different
 message


>> where
 the
 IDF
 concluded
 based
 on


intelligence
 that
 he
 most
 likely
 did
 not


survive
 on
 October
 7th.
 And
 we
 asked,


okay,
 where's
 the
 physical
 evidence?
 He


says,
 oh,
 we
 don't
 have
 that.
 So,
 we


understand,
 we
 looked
 at,
 I
 looked
 at


the
 intelligence.
 I
 understand
 that
 most


likely
 Tai
 is
 not
 one
 of
 the
 20,
 but
 he


is
 no
 less
 of
 a
 hostage.


[Music]


You
 know,
 there's
 the
 missing
 holidays,


you
 know,
 Thanksgiving
 to
 Hanukkah
 to,


you
 know,
 Easter
 and
 just,
 you
 know,


think
 of
 a
 family
 dinner,
 holiday
 dinner


with
 a
 chair
 that
 is
 empty.


You
 know,
 Tai
 going
 back
 to
 the
 Celtics.


you
 know,
 now
 is
 the
 beginning
 of


basketball
 season.
 We
 will
 be
 sitting
 on


the
 couch,
 you
 know,
 thinking
 about
 and


jabbing
 one
 another
 who
 has
 a
 better


chance
 of
 winning
 the
 division
 title
 and


we
 will
 play
 uh
 NBA
 2K
 and
 he
 will
 play


with
 the
 Celtics.
 I'd
 play
 with
 the


Knicks.
 He
 would
 of
 course
 beat
 me


because
 he's
 much
 better
 at
 2K
 than
 I
 am


and
 he's
 missing.


It
 is
 just
 as
 important
 to
 us
 to
 get


Itai
 back
 and
 then
 we'll
 deal
 with
 the


two
 options
 that
 we
 have.
 Either
 being


able
 to
 hug
 him
 or
 it
 means
 that
 one


chapter
 ended
 and
 we
 need
 to
 start


another
 chapter
 of
 our
 family.
 But
 we


need
 to
 have
 that
 ending
 of
 this


chapter.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


[Music]


Some
 of
 the
 family
 members
 at
 the
 square


have
 the
 answers
 that
 people
 like
 Ruby


are
 dreading.
 They
 know
 that
 their


relatives
 are
 dead,
 but
 they
 come
 here


for
 different
 reasons.
 They
 come
 to


support
 other
 people.
 They
 come
 out
 of
 a


sense
 of
 solidarity.


They
 come
 because
 they
 understand
 what


it
 means
 to
 wait
 for
 these
 kinds
 of


answers
 and
 to
 finally
 get
 them.


[Music]


Can
 you
 tell
 me
 to
 start
 just
 who
 you


are
 and
 why
 you're
 here
 tonight?


>> Okay.
 So,
 my
 name
 is
 Kit
 Pali
 Katir.
 I'm


the
 daughter
 of
 Ramy
 Katir
 who
 was


murdered
 on
 October
 7th
 in
 Kibbutz
 Niro.


My
 mother
 Khan
 Katir
 was
 abducted
 from


Kibbutni
 Ros.
 And
 my
 brother
 Alad
 was


also
 kidnapped
 from
 Kibutznos.


My
 mom
 returned
 after
 49
 days
 in


captivity
 in
 Gaza.
 and
 my
 brother


Allahad
 was
 murdered
 in
 captivity
 and


his
 body
 was
 retrieved
 to
 Israel
 on
 um


April
 2024


when
 my
 mother
 came
 back.
 I
 remember


when
 she
 she
 was
 brought
 on
 a
 journey


and
 and
 she
 looked
 like
 up
 and
 she
 saw


me
 and
 she
 saw
 my
 sister
 and
 then
 I


could
 see
 that
 she's
 looking
 about
 the


the
 missing
 faces.
 She
 couldn't
 see
 my


father
 and
 she
 couldn't
 see
 my
 brother


and
 she
 asked
 me
 where
 are
 they
 and
 I


have
 to
 tell
 her
 like
 on
 the
 first
 5


minutes
 she's
 with
 us
 that
 uh
 my
 father


her
 husband
 was
 shot
 to
 death
 and
 that


my
 brother
 for
 me
 it
 was
 good
 news.
 I


told
 her
 mom
 but
 you
 know
 the
 good
 news


is
 that
 he's
 kidnapped
 and
 he's
 alive


and
 it's
 crazy
 that
 even
 considered
 to


be
 a
 good
 news
 but
 for
 us
 it
 was
 a
 good


news
 I
 remember
 when
 they
 told
 us
 that


he's
 dead.
 So
 my
 mom
 she
 was
 in
 the


hospital
 at
 this
 at
 the
 time
 and
 she


told
 the
 officer
 that
 she
 wants
 her
 son


my
 brother
 to
 be
 brought
 to
 her
 so
 she


can
 kiss
 him
 goodbye.
 And
 then
 the


officer
 was
 shocked
 and
 he
 he
 told
 her


like,


"We
 can't
 bring
 him
 over.
 You
 you
 can't


kiss
 him
 goodbye
 because
 his
 body
 wasn't


in
 a
 state
 that
 she
 could
 have
 done


that."
 And
 it's
 awful
 because


the
 the
 sense
 of
 closure
 is
 it's
 not


full
 because


we
 don't
 get
 to
 have
 this
 normal
 phases


of
 grief
 and
 and
 goodbye.
 Um,


>> meanwhile,
 Carme's
 mom
 was
 struggling


more
 and
 more
 with
 her
 health,
 suffering


from
 ailments
 related
 to
 her
 captivity.


>> She
 steadily
 declined
 and
 passed
 away


last
 year.


>> It's
 a
 huge
 difference
 between
 what
 I've


been
 through
 with
 my
 father
 or
 my


brother
 or
 with
 her
 because
 with
 her
 we


have
 the
 the
 opportunity
 and
 the


privilege
 to
 to
 say
 goodbye,
 to
 say
 how


much
 we
 love
 her,
 to
 hold
 her
 hands,
 for


her
 not
 to
 feel
 alone
 for
 a
 second.
 And


we
 didn't
 have
 that
 with
 my
 brother
 and


we
 didn't
 have
 that
 with
 my
 father.
 And


this
 make
 this
 feeling
 of
 closure
 very


different.


>> The
 people
 here,
 the
 families,
 there
 are


so
 many
 families
 who
 are
 anticipating


having
 their
 loved
 ones
 returned.


What
 does
 that
 feel
 like
 as
 somebody


that
 also
 was
 in
 that
 position?


>> I
 I'm
 struggling
 all
 the
 time
 for
 736


days
 today.
 I'm
 fighting
 for
 the
 release


of
 all
 hostages.
 This
 is
 my
 main
 goal
 in


life
 and
 of
 course
 I'm
 so
 thrilled
 that


it's
 finally
 happening.
 Uh
 but
 of
 course


like
 emotionally
 it's
 so
 complicated


because
 you
 know
 tomorrow
 people
 are


going
 to
 hug
 their
 loved
 ones
 and
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 have
 this
 hug
 forever.


How
 do
 you
 think
 the
 country
 has
 changed


and
 how
 much
 of
 that
 change
 is
 permanent


and
 how
 much
 will
 go
 away
 when
 the
 war


is
 over?


>> I
 feel
 that
 this
 war
 has
 been
 too
 much


and
 too
 long
 and
 too
 devastating
 both


for
 Israelis
 and
 for
 Palestinians,
 for


Gazan
 people.
 Uh,
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 loss


and
 the
 ruins
 both
 in
 Israel
 and
 in
 the


and
 in
 Gaza,


it
 will
 take
 years
 and
 decades
 to


rebuild
 something
 new.
 I'm
 not
 talking


about
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 house
 or
 the


the
 homes
 or
 the
 neighborhoods.
 I'm


talking
 about
 the
 the
 possibility
 of


living


one
 next
 to
 each
 other.


And
 I
 feel
 like
 there
 is
 a
 crisis
 of


trust
 or
 of
 confident
 between
 the


Israeli
 people
 and
 and
 its
 leadership.


So
 I
 feel
 that
 in
 the
 end
 of
 the
 war,


none
 of
 us
 is
 feeling
 more
 safe
 and
 it's


sad
 to
 say
 that.


[Music]


Coming
 up
 next,
 I
 speak
 with
 my


colleague
 Isabelle
 Kersner
 on
 what
 the


return
 of
 the
 hostages
 means
 more


broadly
 for
 Israeli
 society
 and
 for
 the


end
 of
 the
 war.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Isabelle,
 thanks
 so
 much
 for
 talking
 to


us.
 We
 are
 speaking
 at
 this
 moment
 when


there
 are
 enormous
 scenes
 unfolding
 not


just
 where
 you
 and
 I
 are
 in
 Israel,
 but


also
 in
 Gaza
 where
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 people
 are
 going
 back
 to
 their
 homes


and
 their
 neighborhoods
 which
 have
 been


largely
 destroyed
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 start
 rebuilding
 their
 lives.
 And


international
 journalists
 are
 still


waiting
 for
 access
 to
 Gaza.
 We're
 not


allowed
 in
 there.
 In
 the
 meantime,
 I


wanted
 to
 come
 to
 Israel
 where
 there
 was


this
 seismic
 event
 happening
 which
 is


the
 return
 of
 the
 hostages.
 So
 just
 to


start,
 can
 you
 remind
 us
 who
 are
 the


hostages
 as
 a
 whole?


Sure,
 Rachel.
 So
 the
 hostages
 were
 taken


captive
 during
 the
 Hamasled
 attack
 on


Israel
 on
 October
 7th,
 2023.


And
 at
 the
 time
 about
 250
 people
 were


taken
 captive
 and
 taken
 back
 to
 Gaza.


They
 included
 many
 civilians,
 women,


children,
 grandparents,
 and
 some


soldiers.
 In
 the
 intervening
 two
 years


of
 war,
 we've
 had
 in
 the
 past
 two
 brief


temporary
 ceasefires


where
 some
 hostages
 were
 exchanged
 for


some
 Palestinian
 prisoners
 from
 Israeli


jails
 and
 the
 women
 and
 children
 for
 the


most
 part
 were
 returned.
 Some
 of
 the


younger
 men
 who
 were
 considered
 to
 be
 in


the
 most
 vulnerable
 states
 physically


were
 returned.
 And
 what
 we're
 expecting


is
 early
 Monday
 morning
 for
 the
 20
 live


hostages
 to
 all
 be
 returned
 more
 or
 less


at
 the
 same
 time.
 They're
 mainly
 men,


mostly
 young
 men,
 mostly
 civilians,
 and


some
 a
 small
 number
 of
 soldiers.


And
 then
 the
 remains
 of
 26
 more
 people


who
 were
 either
 killed
 or
 died
 in


captivity.


Some
 are
 supposed
 to
 also
 be
 returned


later
 in
 the
 day
 on
 Monday,
 but
 the


authorities
 have
 been
 saying
 that
 uh
 it


will
 be
 much
 harder
 to
 locate
 all
 the


remains.
 Some
 might
 be
 buried
 in
 places


that
 very
 few
 people
 know
 where
 they
 are


and
 so
 it
 could
 take
 much
 longer
 to


return
 all
 of
 them.
 Can
 you
 remind
 us


Isabelle
 how
 these
 hostage
 returns
 have


worked
 in
 the
 past
 just
 mechanically
 and


what
 is
 different
 about
 this
 time?


>> Of course.
 So
 in
 the
 past
 what
 we've


seen
 largely
 are
 these
 ceremonies
 where


Hamas
 militants
 would
 kind
 of
 in
 a
 show


of
 force
 build
 a
 stage
 and
 bring
 out


some
 of
 the
 hostages
 in
 small
 groups


surrounded
 by
 masked
 gunmen.
 Sometimes


be
 made
 to
 wave
 to
 the
 crowd
 or
 to
 give


little
 speeches.
 This
 time
 around,
 we


understand
 that
 Hamas
 is
 supposed
 to
 not


be
 holding
 these
 ceremonies.
 So,
 we


might
 not
 see
 very
 much
 at
 the


beginning,
 but
 the
 idea
 is
 they
 will
 be


handed
 over
 to
 representatives
 of
 the


Red
 Cross
 in
 Gaza.
 They
 will
 then
 be


transported
 and
 handed
 over
 to
 Israeli


military
 and
 will
 be
 brought
 over
 the


border
 into
 a
 an
 Israeli
 military
 base


called
 Rahim,
 which
 is
 uh
 in
 southern


Israel.
 And
 that's
 where
 they
 usually


get
 their
 initial
 checks
 to
 see
 what


their
 condition
 is
 and
 are
 reunited
 with


close
 family
 members.
 And
 you
 know,
 you


ask
 what's
 different
 this
 time.
 Um,
 so


much
 is
 different
 this
 time.
 I
 mean,
 for


one
 thing,
 these
 hostages
 have
 been
 in


captivity
 for
 2
 years,
 so
 nobody
 really


knows
 what
 their
 condition
 is.
 We've


seen
 some
 hostage
 videos
 released
 by


Hamas
 over
 the
 months
 where
 some
 have


appeared
 extremely
 emaciated
 and


skeletal
 and
 very,
 very
 distressed.
 And


you
 know,
 it's
 very
 unclear
 what
 the


condition
 will
 be
 of
 those
 coming
 out


alive.
 And
 for
 the
 Palestinians,
 too.


The
 Israelis
 are
 releasing
 more
 than
 200


Palestinian
 prisoners
 who
 were
 convicted


of
 life
 terms
 for
 serious
 deadly
 attacks


against
 Israelis,
 plus
 almost
 2,000


about
 1,700
 plus
 detainees
 from
 Gaza
 who


were
 detained
 by
 Israeli
 forces
 during


the
 war
 and
 brought
 to
 Israel.
 So
 it


it's
 a
 a
 very
 large
 landmark
 occasion
 on


all
 sides.
 One
 of
 our
 producers,
 Claire


Tennis
 Getter
 and
 I
 spent
 last
 night,


Saturday
 night,
 at
 Hostage
 Square,
 where


there
 have
 been
 weekly
 rallies
 in


support
 of
 bringing
 the
 hostages
 home


since
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 war.
 And
 last


night
 was
 one
 of,
 if
 not
 the
 biggest


crowd
 that
 has
 ever
 been
 there,


according
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


reports.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 the


significance
 of
 the
 hostages
 to
 the
 war


and
 to
 Israeli
 society
 and
 how
 that's


changed
 since
 the
 start
 of
 all
 of
 this?


>> Well,
 there's
 an
 ethos
 in
 Israel
 that's


largely
 been
 nurtured
 through
 the


Israeli
 military,
 which
 is
 a


conscription
 army.
 So,
 you
 know,
 most


people
 in
 Israel,
 their
 children
 or


their
 siblings,
 somebody
 they
 know,


their
 neighbors
 will
 be
 serving
 or
 will


have
 been
 serving
 in
 the
 military.
 And


the
 ethos
 because
 it's
 a
 so-called


people's
 army
 particularly
 has
 been
 that


you
 never
 leave
 soldiers
 behind
 in
 the


field.
 And
 there's
 been
 a
 feeling
 that's


grown
 over
 the
 two
 years
 as
 these


captives
 have
 languished
 longer
 and


longer
 that
 the
 Israeli
 government
 had


essentially
 abandoned
 these
 people
 and


left
 them
 in
 the
 field.
 So
 the
 square


has
 become
 a
 kind
 of
 fulcrum
 of
 uh
 anger


and
 frustration
 as
 successive
 rounds
 of


hostage
 talks
 collapsed
 and
 ceasefires


collapsed
 and
 and
 this
 war
 seemed
 to
 be


turning
 into
 a
 forever
 war.
 And
 now
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 you
 experienced
 a


complete
 uh
 flip
 and
 switch
 in
 the


atmosphere
 to
 actually
 seeing
 some
 light


at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 and
 seeing
 the


hostages
 about
 to
 come
 back
 and
 seeing


this
 war
 end,
 which
 a
 majority
 of


Israelis
 has
 been
 calling
 for.
 I
 mean,


in
 every
 single
 opinion
 poll
 for
 months


and
 months
 and
 months,
 you've
 had
 a


majority
 cutting
 across
 political
 lines


saying
 that
 they
 favored
 prioritizing


a
 hostage
 deal
 and
 a
 return
 of
 the


hostages
 over
 continuing
 the
 war.
 I
 was


really
 struck
 by
 how
 many
 people
 were


carrying
 signs
 saying,
 "Thank
 you,
 Mr.


President,"
 with
 pictures
 of
 President


Trump
 on
 them.
 There
 was
 one
 guy


actually
 dressed
 as
 President
 Trump


holding
 a
 sign
 that
 said
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize,
 like
 indicating
 he
 should
 get
 it,


which
 obviously
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have


talked
 about
 how
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 the


Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.
 And
 in
 the
 speeches


that
 we
 heard,
 particularly
 in
 Steve


Whit's
 speech,
 that's
 the
 Middle
 East


envoy
 for
 the
 Trump
 administration.


Every
 time
 Witco
 mentioned
 Trump,
 the


crowd
 would
 go
 nuts
 and
 cheer
 and
 clap.


And
 every
 time
 Witoff
 mentioned
 Prime


Minister
 Benjamin
 Netanyahu,
 people


would
 boo.
 And
 I
 wonder
 what
 you
 make
 of


that.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 quite
 stunning
 to
 see


actually,
 Rachel.
 I
 mean,
 the
 cheer
 that


went
 up
 as
 Witoff
 and
 Jared
 Kushner
 and


Ivanka
 Trump
 walked
 through
 the
 crowd


and
 and
 took
 the
 podium
 and
 the


electrifying
 atmosphere
 and
 yes,
 this


massive
 gratitude
 and
 appreciation
 of


the
 Trump
 administration's
 role
 and


President
 Trump
 personally
 in
 in
 getting


this
 done.
 And
 then
 as
 you
 mentioned,


you
 know,
 this
 extended
 prolonged
 booing


that
 uh
 accompanied
 every
 time
 Wickoff


mentioned
 Netanyahu's
 name,
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 anger
 still
 against
 the


government
 for
 Netanyahu's
 refusal
 to


take
 responsibility
 personally
 for,
 you


know,
 the
 failures,
 the
 intelligence


failures,
 the
 policy
 failures
 that


occurred
 on
 his
 watch.
 And
 you
 know,
 I


think
 that's
 what
 you
 were
 seeing
 last


night
 in
 the
 square.
 And
 there
 was


immediately
 afterward
 a
 lot
 of


discussion
 on
 the
 panel
 shows
 on
 TV


about,
 you
 know,
 whether
 it
 was


appropriate
 or
 not,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 a


very
 genuine,
 authentic,
 spontaneous


response
 and
 nobody
 had
 planned
 it
 or


rehearsed
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just,


you
 know,
 very
 reflective
 of
 of
 how


people
 have
 felt
 here.


>> What
 are
 we
 watching
 for
 now?
 What
 are


people
 expecting
 to
 happen
 next?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 the
 golden
 question.
 Nobody


really
 knows
 this
 deal.


It
 was
 very
 vague.
 Um,
 other
 than
 the


first
 phase
 of
 it,
 which
 is
 the
 hostage


for
 Palestinian
 prisoner
 exchange
 and
 an


increase
 in
 aid
 going
 into
 the
 Gaza


Strip
 as
 well
 as
 a
 Israeli
 pullback.


There's
 already
 been
 an
 initial
 pull


back
 of
 forces
 to
 a
 defense
 line
 within


the
 Gaza
 Strip.
 Beyond
 that,
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 open
 questions
 which
 do
 raise


concerns
 about
 the,
 you
 know,
 fragility


of
 of
 such
 a
 deal.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


why
 we're
 also
 seeing
 on
 Monday
 after


President
 Trump
 makes
 this
 sort
 of


lightning
 4-hour
 visit
 to
 Israel,
 he's


then
 going
 on
 to
 Charal
 Shik
 in
 in
 Egypt


for
 what
 he's
 calling
 a
 peace
 summit
 led


by
 himself
 and
 the
 president
 of
 Egypt


where
 they've
 invited
 world
 leaders
 and


the
 Arab
 partners
 to
 sort
 of
 buttress


and
 support
 this
 deal.
 And
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 the
 idea
 is
 just
 to
 create
 as


strong
 a
 coalition
 as
 possible
 and
 as


broad
 as
 possible
 of
 countries
 who
 are


just
 going
 to
 try
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 uh


this
 holds.
 I
 mean,
 whatever
 happens


next,
 clearly
 people
 in
 Israel
 at
 least


are
 celebrating
 the
 end
 of
 the
 war.
 It


feels
 to
 them
 like
 we
 have
 reached
 the


end
 of
 the
 war
 with
 this
 first
 phase.


Does
 that
 seem
 fair
 to
 you?


>> Yes.
 I
 think
 Israelis
 for
 the
 large
 part


are
 relieved
 after
 2
 years.


There's
 little
 appetite
 in
 Israel
 to


continue
 fighting.
 It's
 a
 very
 cysifian


task
 really.
 You're
 in
 a
 insurgency


situation
 and
 it
 just
 seemed
 to
 be
 a


kind
 of
 stalemate.


But
 does
 it
 mean
 peace?
 Does
 it
 mean
 the


Israeli
 Palestinian
 conflict
 has
 been


resolved?
 Absolutely
 not.


[Music]


I
 mean,
 the
 fundamental
 issues
 remain,


but
 it
 certainly
 brings
 this
 2-year


chapter
 to
 some
 kind
 of
 close,
 however


unclear
 the
 future
 looks.


Isabelle,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


Here's


[Music]


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


Over
 the
 weekend,
 President
 Trump
 said


that
 he
 would
 pay
 members
 of
 the


military
 during
 the
 government
 shutdown,


tapping
 into
 about
 $8
 billion
 of


Pentagon
 funds.


It
 would
 cover
 the
 next
 pay
 period
 for


more
 than
 a
 million
 active
 duty
 service


members.
 But
 it's
 not
 clear
 how
 long
 the


administration
 could
 pay
 troops
 if


Congress
 and
 the
 White
 House
 can't
 reach


a
 spending
 deal.


Meanwhile,
 the
 Smithsonian
 Institution


said
 on
 Sunday
 that
 the
 shutdown
 has


forced
 it
 to
 close
 its
 21
 museums
 and


the
 National
 Zoo.
