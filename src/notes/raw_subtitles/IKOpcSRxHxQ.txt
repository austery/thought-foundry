In 1992,
the year that the Los Angeles
homicide rate reached an all-time high,
members of the Crips and Bloods,
two of the largest gangs in the US,
sat down together
and brokered a peace treaty.
This historic event ended
a three-decade-long urban war
that claimed more than 10,000
lives in LA County alone,
not including those permanently
maimed or incarcerated for life.
I was one of those gang members
who negotiated that treaty.
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
Growing up in the Jordan Downs
housing projects
in the Watts section of Los Angeles,
I witnessed things
no child should ever be subject to.
By the time I was 16,
I had attended 20 funerals of friends.
And like so many youth
surrounded by violence and poverty,
I was desensitized and angry.
And joining the neighborhood gang
was my solution for safety and protection.
Now, it's important to understand
that Black American gangs
aren't inherently violent.
Less than three to five percent
of so-called gang members
are actually committing violent crime.
More often, they're like
surrogate families.
We're protecting one another,
but sometimes the only way
we knew how to survive.
In the first two years
of the peace treaty,
homicides in Watts declined by 44 percent,
changing the quality of life
in my neighborhood.
I was just 23 years old,
and my firstborn son, Terrell,
had just turned seven.
Driven by the belief that our children
would not inherit our conflicts,
we took the call to peace
to 16 more cities,
contributing to a national decline
in youth violence.
You see, peace was possible
because nobody could stop that war but us.
Those of us at the center of the conflict.
It took months of intense
high-stake conversations,
starting with a handful of brothers
from the four housing projects.
During the negotiation,
I asked who was winning the war
that we were waging against each other.
Every time we'd die or go to prison,
no one was there to provide direction
and guidance for our kids.
You see, violence is about proximity.
I had known most of my so-called
enemies my entire life,
from school and from the neighborhood.
A small group of us
went into so-called enemy territory.
The news of the peace treaty
spread like wildfires.
Hundreds of youths
from formerly warring gangs
attended celebrations in the projects
to mark the new beginning.
The peace treaty inspired
similar agreements across the country
and lasted for 12 years.
Fast forward into today,
the cycle of violence remains
an extremely concentrated problem
with unequal impacts.
Residents in low-income
urban communities of color
are 15 times more likely
to be harmed by violence,
but yet three times
less likely to get help.
And for Black males ages 14 to 25,
violence is the number one cause of death.
As this crisis has worsened in cities,
overwhelmed police departments
are joining forces with community leaders
to say that arrests alone
will not end the cycle of violence.
Many solutions are being proposed.
But what we're proposing
is an internal solution.
A solution led by those
most impacted by violence.
A solution that lifts up
nontraditional leaders
to play a key role in creating safety
in their own respective communities.
You see,
investing in nontraditional leaders
as a complement to policing works.
In 2014 --
(Applause)
I got a call from my friend Ras Baraka,
mayor of Newark, New Jersey.
Mayor Baraka asked me to help him
to strengthen his community
violence intervention strategy.
Now, Newark had been on the top ten
most violent city lists
for almost 50 consecutive years.
With a modest investment
from local philanthropies,
I launched a Newark Community Street Team.
I hired 16 credible messengers,
many of them ex-gang members
and formerly incarcerated folks
who have deep relationships
in the neighborhood.
We trained them in conflict resolution
and mediation strategies
and deployed them in high-violence areas,
and asked them to use
their relationship capital
to intervene and mediate gang disputes
that could lead to violence.
Now, you know, law enforcement
investigations are crucial,
but not always successful,
and often painstakingly slow,
whereas the credible messengers
can prevent the next
shooting in real time.
We launched the Safe Passage program
to ensure our kids went to school safely,
because violence often happens
before and after school.
We launched the city's first
trauma recovery center
to provide therapeutic services
to victims to help them heal.
We also provided mentoring
and outreach and case management.
You see, safety
isn't just one intervention.
It's a shared strategy
and requires an ecosystem
of programs that residents trust.
When we started our work
in Newark in 2014,
the city had 103 homicides.
In 2024, we had 37.
(Applause)
Family, these are not just numbers.
They're actual lives saved.
Newark now has nine
consecutive years of decline,
and we're no longer on the top ten
most violent city lists.
(Applause)
Now, what we achieved in Newark
was more than historic lows in violence.
Local law enforcement credits us
as the essential strategic partner
in reducing violence in the city.
And today, the Newark Street team
has over 80 staff,
is a formal partner with the city,
and received millions of dollars
in public funding.
Now, family, we're not just the only ones
that's improving safety in our cities.
It's just rarely recognized and supported.
Take my good friend, Miss Brenda Glass,
a survivor of violence
from Cleveland, Ohio.
Brenda started Cleveland's
first trauma recovery center,
but had to cash in her retirement fund
just to keep her doors open.
And despite being the city's
only 24-hour assistance for victims,
it took the city five years
before they granted her money.
Another champion is my brother
Lyle Muhammad from Miami,
who employs credible messengers
in some of the most violent neighborhoods
but struggles to provide a livable wage
and ongoing training for his staff.
These often overlooked groups
are most of the time
ineligible for public funding,
but what they do have
is deep commitment, lived experience,
trust and community support.
Now, other cities are primed to replicate
the successes that we had in Newark
and following the steps of leaders
like Brenda and Lyle,
but very few essential
community organizations
have the know-how to become
a permanent part
of the city's public safety workforce.
Family, we're about to change all of that
with the generous investment
from the Audacious TED community.
(Applause)
And support from people just like you.
We're launching Scaling Safety,
an initiative to put the public
back in public safety.
Our solution is simple.
Redefine public safety
by investing in a coordinated
set of high-impact,
resident-led programs
that create real, lasting change.
In 2021,
I launched a community-based
public safety collective
to spread the Newark Community
Street Team strategy nationwide.
We've already helped 150
organizations in 60-plus cities.
Now we're teaming up
with the Alliance for Safety and Justice,
the nation's leader
in public safety advocacy.
ASJ has unlocked
three billion dollars in funding
and led 150 policy reforms
to support community safety programs.
Together, we're creating a stronger,
more effective approach to safety,
one that complements law enforcement
and breaks the cycle of harm.
Now, addressing
violence is extremely complex,
but just as we no longer rely on hospitals
and emergency rooms alone
to improve public health,
we cannot rely on the justice system alone
to create safety.
(Applause)
In public health,
community health workers emerged
to improve preventative health care
by training residents in outreach
and peer support.
They've reduced the burdens
on emergency rooms
and improved public health.
We believe the same can be done
with public safety,
because racially equitable
access to safety
begins with community engagement.
Now, in 2003, my oldest son, Terrell,
that was seven years old
when I negotiated the treaty,
graduated from high school
and was accepted
into Humboldt State University.
(Applause)
The proudest day of my life, family,
was driving this kid to school
to start his first day
as a college student.
Terrell was an inspiration
to his younger siblings
and the reason why I became
a lifelong advocate for peace.
He came home from winter break.
He went to a party
with some of his friends
in an affluent neighborhood in LA.
There, some kids from a local gang
showed up at the party,
mistook his red Mickey Mouse
sweater for gang colors,
and shot him to death.
Family, I'm no novice to violence,
I've witnessed it my entire life.
But nothing prepares you
for the loss of your child.
But what I've come to understand
is that peace is a journey
and not a destination.
And that public safety is not just
the absence of violence and crime,
but the presence of well-being
and the infrastructure to support
victims and survivors
in their healing journey.
Scaling Safety is our healing journey
and my continued commitment to Terrell
and Oscar Guizar and Ronzell Pointer,
and the thousands like them,
that their deaths were not in vain.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Helen Walters: Aqeela,
another hug, if you will.
OK, come right here, I have a question.
Thank you for sharing your story.
I speak on behalf of everybody
when I say that we're
so sorry for your loss.
Aqeela Sherrills: Thank you.
HW: We talked a lot
this week about actionable hope.
What you're doing exemplifies a spirit
that too many of us have no idea
what you've experienced
and what you do on a daily basis.
What advice do you give those
who are trying to dig deep in this time,
to step up and to find actionable hope?
How do you do it?
AS: I would say that where
the wounds are in the personal life
is where the gift lie.
Sometimes we have to sit long and hard,
in the anguish and the pain
of the things that we suffered
and keep our eye on the prize, you know,
continue to look for the gift despite,
you know, the circumstances around you.
You know, the thing that I would
encourage folks to do
is to find someone
that you know or don’t know,
sometimes it’s easy to talk
to people that you don’t know.
And expose the deep secrets
in your personal life,
you know, as a way of accessing
the gift of who you are.
Because when you undress yourself,
others can’t undress you, right?
And I would say,
for the folks who are the listeners
because, you know,
people always, you know, come to us
and they tell us their horror story,
hold space for them, behold them,
don't define them as their experience,
because we're not the things
that we've perpetrated
or the things that have been done to us.
Those things are only
informing who we become,
they don't define who we are.
HW: Aqeela, you're an inspiration.
Thank you.
One more.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
