 GBT
 becomes
 a
 monopoly.
 It
 is


transforming
 how
 everybody,
 every
 normal


person
 basically
 does
 their
 work,
 funds


their
 life.
 The
 thesis
 of
 AI
 is
 too


important
 to
 the
 future
 of
 nations
 to


allow
 an
 American
 company
 to
 dominate
 in


certain
 regions.
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to


prove
 to
 be
 true.
 I
 actually
 believe
 you


can
 probably
 cut
 50%
 of
 the
 federal


government.
 What
 does
 the
 commerce


department
 actually
 do?
 People
 are
 like,


"Where
 do
 you
 get
 your
 contrarian


ideas?"
 I
 was
 like, "I
 read
 books."
 Like


all
 the
 greatest
 thinking
 of
 all
 time
 is


available
 to
 anybody.
 You
 just
 have
 to


read.


>> Yeah.


>> Keith,
 welcome
 to
 the
 podcast.


>> Pleasure
 to
 be
 with
 you.


>> It's
 been
 a
 long
 time.
 Excited
 to


excited
 to
 have
 you
 back.
 It's
 an


exciting
 day
 to
 do
 it.
 Big
 day
 for
 the


Middle
 East.
 You
 This
 I
 feel
 like
 this


is
 something
 you've
 been
 predicting
 for


a
 while.


>> Well,
 if
 you
 read
 uh
 actually
 if
 you


read
 uh
 Jared
 Kushner's
 autobiography.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 like
 quote
 he


quotes
 you
 know
 the
 Saudi
 uh
 king
 says


you're
 going
 to
 bring
 peace
 to
 the


Middle
 East.
 And
 it
 turns
 out
 to
 be


correct.
 Um
 it
 was
 pretty
 obvious
 like


this
 would
 happen.
 Um
 if
 you
 went
 to


visited
 Israel
 recently
 in
 the
 last
 69


months
 you
 could
 feel
 the
 Tatonic
 plates


shifting.
 It
 was
 just
 a
 question
 what


would
 be
 the
 trigger
 and
 everybody's


looking
 forward
 to
 the
 new
 Middle
 East.


You're
 going to
 see
 lots
 of
 countries


you
 know
 make
 peace
 explicitly
 with


Israel
 which
 is
 great.
 Um
 whether
 they


join
 the
 Abraham
 Accords
 directly
 or


indirectly
 it's
 all
 going
 to
 happen
 in


the
 next
 six
 months.
 Is
 is
 your
 view


that
 Iran
 is
 neutralized
 that
 this
 leads


to
 some
 sort
 of
 durable
 um
 non
 violent


pack?


>> Everybody
 off
 the
 record
 wanted
 Iran
 to


be
 to
 you
 be
 neutralized
 and
 they
 were


basically
 blocking
 any
 progress.
 People


were
 scared,
 terrified
 and
 now
 that


they've
 been
 neutralized.
 I
 think
 the


natural
 arc
 of
 human
 history
 is
 for


there
 be
 basically
 progress
 innovation


technology
 innovation
 actually
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 driving
 piece
 AI
 data


centers.
 you're
 going to
 see
 all
 of


this.
 Uh
 it's
 it's
 really
 an
 interesting


and
 fascinating
 future.


>> Yeah.
 Are
 are
 you
 bullish
 on
 sovereign


AI
 sort
 of
 that
 these
 are
 you
 sort
 of


you
 know
 think
 that
 you
 might
 invest
 in


that
 type
 of


>> We
 have
 at
 KV
 we
 invested
 in
 a
 sovereign


AI
 company
 in
 Japan
 called
 Scono.
 The


thesis
 of
 AI
 is
 too
 important
 to
 the


future
 of
 nations
 to
 allow
 an
 American


company
 to
 dominate
 in
 certain
 regions
 I


think
 is
 going
 to
 prove
 to
 be
 true.
 I


think
 you
 still
 need
 a
 marshall
 the
 hard


part
 that's
 easy
 to
 say
 at
 a
 conceptual


level
 to
 implement
 that
 though
 you
 still


need
 a
 marshall
 a
 critical
 density
 of


talent
 of
 AI
 researchers
 and
 there's
 not


that
 many
 world-class
 AI
 researchers


across
 the
 globe.
 I
 saw
 you
 know
 public


presentation
 by
 Jensen
 where
 he
 said


there's
 150
 people
 on
 the
 planet
 who


could
 actually
 build
 a
 foundational


model.
 He's
 probably
 more
 right
 than


wrong.
 And
 so
 you
 still,
 if
 you're
 going


to
 build
 one
 for
 Germany
 or
 Europe
 or


Israel
 or
 wherever,
 you're
 still
 going


to
 need
 a
 critical
 density
 of
 those
 150


people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 compete
 at
 the


cutting
 edge
 of
 frontier
 models.
 But
 I


think
 most
 countries
 are
 going
 to
 try.


>> Yeah.
 Before
 we
 get
 to
 tech,
 just
 to


close
 the
 the
 the
 politics
 front,
 do
 you


think
 that
 this
 will
 end
 up
 defining


Trump's
 legacy
 or
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think


his
 second
 term
 will
 be
 remembered
 for?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 thinking


last
 night,
 you
 know,
 he's
 going
 to


solve
 all
 the
 problems
 he
 inherited
 in


the
 first
 two
 years.
 Like
 if
 you
 think


about
 it,
 immigration
 basically
 solved.


Uh
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 Middle
 East
 on


its
 way
 to
 being
 solved,
 he'll
 get


Russia
 and
 Ukraine
 solved.
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 tariffs
 are
 bringing
 down
 the
 debt.


The
 growth
 rate
 is
 going
 to
 accelerate.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 4%
 or
 more
 growth


all
 of
 next
 year.
 That
 will
 make
 the


debt
 irrelevant.
 You
 can
 grow
 your
 way


out
 of
 deficits.
 Um
 interest
 rates
 still


need
 to
 come
 down.
 Trying
 to
 fix
 the


Federal
 The
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 been


obset.
 That'll
 eventually
 get
 fixed.
 He


will
 replace
 Powell
 at
 some
 point.


Bess's
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 be


outstanding.
 So,
 I
 think
 after
 the
 next


year,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 all
 upside.


>> And
 and
 why
 doesn't
 Powell
 want
 to


reduce
 rates?
 What
 is
 the
 seal
 man
 for


what?


>> Well,
 his
 argument
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know


that
 he
 has
 a
 good
 argument.
 I
 don't
 I


think
 he
 has
 Trump
 derangement
 syndrome.


He
 just
 hates
 Trump.
 That's
 why
 he


artificially
 lowered
 rates
 to
 try
 to
 get


Camala
 elected.
 It
 is
 indefensible


cutting
 50
 basis
 points
 off
 in
 LA,
 you


know,
 last
 fall.
 But
 he
 does
 see


employment
 is
 running
 pretty
 hot.
 But


the
 the
 difference
 is
 with
 AI
 and


productivity
 gains
 through
 technology.


Hot
 employment
 does
 not
 necessarily


yield
 inflation.
 It's
 not
 a
 it's
 not


just
 wage
 growth
 that's
 fueling
 GDP


growth.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 you're
 seeing


some
 of
 the
 substitution
 where


productivity
 gains
 can
 be
 made.
 GDP
 can


run
 four
 5%
 without
 triggering
 inflation


because
 it's
 not
 just
 you
 don't
 grow
 GDP


just
 by
 paying
 humans
 more
 which
 is
 the


historical
 precedent.


>> And
 again
 before
 I
 segue
 what's
 sort
 of


reflection
 post
 Doge
 like
 what
 did
 we


learn
 from
 that
 experiment?


>> Well
 actually
 the
 funny
 thing
 is
 I
 was


watching
 some
 political
 polls
 and


there's
 not
 that
 many
 pollsters
 that
 I


find
 accurate
 but
 there's
 a
 few
 and


until
 this
 week
 Trump's
 height
 of
 his


popularity
 was
 when
 Doge
 was
 at
 his


best.
 The
 American
 people
 really
 do
 want


to
 cut
 the
 size
 and
 scope
 of
 the
 federal


government.
 You
 can
 see
 like
 look
 at
 the


government's
 officially
 shut
 down
 and


Trump's
 fixing
 everything.
 It
 it
 does


suggest
 like
 why
 do
 we
 need
 the
 rest
 of


the
 government?
 Like
 everything
 has
 been


better
 the
 last
 two
 weeks.
 Like
 can
 you


name
 one
 thing
 in
 society
 across
 the


globe
 that's
 got
 worse
 in
 the
 last
 two


weeks
 with
 the
 government


>> can't
 go
 public.
 This
 is
 the
 problem.


Yes,
 I
 agree.


>> But
 yeah,
 other
 other
 than
 that
 well


fortunately
 my
 companies
 will
 be
 right


good
 enough
 to
 go
 public
 whenever
 they


want.
 It
 will
 be
 eventually
 but
 um
 you


know
 ramp
 can
 be
 public
 whenever
 it


wants.
 It
 doesn't
 need
 like
 a
 timing
 uh


you
 know
 uh
 move
 and
 manipulation
 but


fundamentally
 that'll
 get
 fixed.
 But
 the


government
 being
 shut
 down
 doesn't
 seem


to
 be
 interfering
 with
 the
 rate
 of


progress.
 And
 I
 think
 maybe
 Americans


wake
 up
 one
 day
 and
 say
 like,
 "Wait,
 why


do
 we
 need
 the
 you
 know
 this
 size


federal
 government?"
 I
 pro
 I
 actually


believe
 you
 could
 probably
 cut
 50%
 of


the
 federal
 government
 um
 ex-military


easily.


Like
 what
 does
 the
 commerce
 department


actually
 do?
 Like
 literally
 I
 mean


Howard
 does
 a
 lot
 of
 work.
 He's
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 everything
 like
 negotiating


tariff
 deals.


>> But
 like
 all
 the
 thousands
 of


bureaucrats
 what
 department
 why
 do
 we


have
 a
 department
 of
 agriculture?
 This


is
 actually
 an
 interesting
 question.
 Why


do
 we
 actually
 have
 thousands
 of
 people


probably
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 it
 recently


but
 probably
 30,000
 people
 work
 at
 the


department
 of
 agriculture


what
 world
 does
 that
 make
 sense
 like


even
 like
 the
 state
 department
 there's


like
 three
 or
 4
 thousand
 uh
 economic


officers
 over
 posted
 overseas
 this
 is


like
 back
 in
 the
 day
 when
 you
 count
 the


ships
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 an
 artifact
 of


history
 where
 you
 count
 the
 ships


showing
 up
 at
 a
 port
 and
 then
 report


back
 to
 DC
 this
 economy
 is
 growing


Poland's
 growing
 the
 UK
 is
 not
 where


obviously
 you
 can
 just
 log
 into
 like
 a


Bloomberg
 terminal
 and
 track
 that


probably
 more
 accurately


>> but
 if
 Elon
 couldn't
 do
 it
 to
 some


degree
 does
 it
 speak
 to
 the


intractability
 of
 actually


>> well
 you
 need
 political
 will
 but
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 things
 the
 last
 two
 weeks
 is


showing
 Trump's
 going
 to
 be
 more
 popular


than
 ever
 he's
 literally
 posting
 the


highest
 popularity
 and
 approval
 rate
 of


his
 career
 right
 now
 and
 the
 government


shut
 down
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 there


hasn't
 been
 political
 will
 is
 when
 you


have
 sort
 of
 a
 diffuse
 benefit
 when
 and


and
 concentrated
 aggravated
 people


politicians
 elected
 officials
 are
 afraid


so
 when
 you
 cut
 something.
 The
 people


who
 like
 whatever
 that
 program
 is,
 they


may
 only
 be
 1%
 of
 the
 population,
 but


they're
 very
 loud
 and
 annoying.
 And
 the


99%
 of
 the
 people
 benefit
 are
 quiet


typically.
 But
 if
 you
 can
 convince


people
 that,
 hey,
 we
 don't
 need
 all
 this


stuff,
 and
 the
 99%
 people
 are
 like,
 hey,


why
 do
 we
 need
 all
 this
 stuff?
 Why
 am
 I


paying
 all
 these
 taxes?
 Then
 the
 1%
 you


can
 safely
 ignore.
 And
 because
 the
 1%


have
 historically
 been
 channeling


through
 the
 legacy
 media,
 which
 is
 no


longer
 relevant,
 it
 they're
 going
 to


need
 to
 find
 a
 new
 megaphone.
 like


whether
 you
 know
 New
 York
 Times
 or
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 writes
 some
 attack


piece,
 nobody
 on
 the
 Republican
 side


cares
 anymore.
 We've
 learned
 that
 that


stuff
 is
 just
 garbage,
 it's
 fake
 and


irrelevant.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 the
 if


you're
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of
 history
 with


the
 right
 evidence
 and
 the
 right
 ideas,


you
 can
 just
 ignore
 the
 legacy
 media.
 So


I
 think
 it's
 going to
 be
 a
 lot
 easier
 to


cut
 things.


>> Do
 you
 think
 uh
 Elon
 and
 Trump
 are
 going


to
 make
 up
 in
 a
 material
 way
 or
 that


Elon
 is
 going
 to
 support
 the
 Republican


party
 and


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Um
 I
 think
 it's
 obvious.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 the
 Charlie
 Kirk
 funeral,


you
 know,
 was
 like
 ceremonial.


>> He
 must
 get
 back
 into
 politics
 in
 a


material.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 he'll
 get
 back
 into


politics,
 but
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 fund
 non


conservative
 parties.
 Like,
 I
 think


that's
 dead.
 I
 put
 a
 stake
 in
 the
 ground


in
 it
 on
 the
 All-In
 podcast.
 I
 think


after
 my
 comments,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 dead


anyway.
 But
 I
 think
 now
 they've


reconciled,
 which
 makes
 sense.
 Like,


ideologically,
 they
 mostly
 agree.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 the
 debate,
 the


funny
 thing
 is
 the
 divorce
 was
 kind
 of


weird
 in
 a
 sense
 of
 Elon's
 kind
 of
 a


perfectionist
 of
 like,
 why
 can't
 you
 do


this?
 Why
 can't
 you
 cut
 more
 faster?
 And


Trump
 was
 like
 the
 political
 realist
 in


that
 case
 where
 he's
 like,
 I
 just
 don't


have
 the
 votes
 in
 the
 Senate
 to
 do
 this


and
 you've
 got
 to
 give
 me
 some,
 you


know,
 over
 time
 I'll
 get
 there,
 but
 you


got
 to
 give
 me
 some
 rope
 and
 you
 got
 to


give
 the
 Secretary
 of
 Treasury
 some


rope.
 And
 it
 was
 really
 a
 not
 a
 fight


about
 the
 idea,
 but
 a
 fight
 about
 like


the
 prioritization,
 sequencing,
 timing.


And
 you
 know,
 Trump's
 a
 pretty
 astute


politician,
 so
 I
 would
 trust
 his


judgment
 on
 the
 timing.
 He's
 pretty


aggressive
 and
 assertive.
 And
 if
 he


doesn't
 think
 he
 can
 move
 that
 fast,


he's
 probably
 more
 right
 than
 wrong.


>> It
 also
 just
 feels
 like
 there's
 this


question
 of
 do
 you
 grow
 your
 way
 out
 of


something
 or
 cut
 your
 way
 out
 of


something.
 The
 greatest
 entrepreneur
 of


all
 time
 and
 you
 can
 quintuple
 I
 mean,


I'm
 making
 this
 up,
 but
 imagine
 you
 can


quintuple
 GDP
 with
 AI
 and
 everything


else
 versus,
 you
 know,
 cut
 us
 even
 more


or
 whatever,
 right?
 Yeah.
 You
 know,
 you


the
 the
 growth
 mentality
 for
 the


greatest
 entrepreneur
 of
 all
 time


probably
 makes
 more
 sense.
 But


>> yeah,
 the
 grow
 the
 growth
 mentality
 is


almost
 surely
 right.
 The
 austerity


mentality
 probably
 doesn't
 work.
 Which


is
 funny
 because
 ironic
 as
 you
 point


out,
 the
 greatest
 entrepreneur
 of
 all


time
 should
 understand
 the
 concept
 to


lift.
 Growth
 and
 lift
 are
 basically
 the


same
 thing.
 And
 you
 need
 to
 create
 value


and
 that
 growing
 GDP
 sustainably
 durably


is
 the
 way
 to
 solve
 America's
 problems.


Austerity
 is
 like
 a
 temporary
 hack.


You're
 kind
 of
 holding
 everything


together
 and
 making
 life
 painful.
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 a
 startup
 trying
 to
 save


its
 cash
 for
 the
 last
 12
 months,
 but


you're
 not
 really
 achieving
 anything.


>> By
 the
 way,
 Keith,
 what's
 your
 mental


model
 prediction
 of
 what
 AI
 will
 do
 to


GDP?
 Some
 people
 are,
 you
 know,
 Teran
 is


more
 conservative
 and
 just
 expressing
 a


mild,
 you
 know,
 step
 up.
 Some
 people
 are


saying,
 oh,
 if
 we
 actually
 have
 AGI,
 you


know,
 should
 be
 10%
 or
 like
 some


>> Well,
 I
 think
 you
 can
 run
 four
 to
 6%


durably
 without
 inflation,
 which
 is


magic.
 Like,
 so
 we
 used
 to
 do
 this
 like


some
 sometimes
 I
 tweet
 about
 like
 4%


growth
 and
 people
 are
 like
 that's
 crazy.


from
 1950
 to
 2010
 on
 average
 in
 a
 normal


decade
 we
 had
 4.6
 years
 per
 decade
 of
 4%


growth
 or
 higher.
 So
 we
 used
 to
 do
 this


all
 the
 time
 and
 expect
 it
 and
 then
 we


stop
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons.
 And
 if


you
 grow
 that
 fast
 a
 incomes
 real


incomes
 grow
 but
 b
 if
 you
 have
 a
 debt
 if


you
 have
 a
 deficit
 you
 can
 solve
 these


problems
 without
 cutting
 essential


services
 and
 you
 can
 probably
 expand
 the


influence
 of
 America
 across
 the
 globe.


what
 what
 you
 know
 what
 Howard
 Lutnik


articulated
 to
 me
 is
 basically
 post


World
 War
 II
 we
 sort
 of
 intentionally


sabotaged
 our
 growth
 and
 harmonized
 it


with
 let's
 say
 Europe
 people
 rebuilding


and
 made
 an
 explicit
 tradeoff
 to
 do
 that


and
 then
 just
 forgot
 that
 50
 60
 70
 80
 90


years
 have
 gone
 by
 and
 that
 makes
 no


sense.
 America
 should
 be
 leading
 the


world
 and
 we
 should
 be
 dominating
 in


technology.
 we
 should
 be
 dominating
 in


growth
 and
 that
 creates
 more
 and
 more


influence.
 So
 it's
 it's
 it
 it's it's


profound
 in
 every
 way.


>> Yeah.
 Let's
 get
 deeper
 just
 on
 the


effects
 of
 AI
 in
 the
 economy.
 If
 if


scaling
 laws
 hold
 to
 to
 some
 degree,
 do


you
 know
 will
 it
 show
 up
 in
 the


productivity
 statistics
 directly?
 um
 you


know
 what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 uh
 wages?


>> But
 you
 do
 have
 the
 I
 do
 believe
 in
 the


ball
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 the
 ball
 cost


thing
 where
 like
 the
 limiting
 step
 is


the
 most
 the
 most
 difficult
 most
 human


things
 actually
 put
 a
 constraint
 on
 like


uh
 AI
 growth
 or
 jobs
 going
 away.
 I
 think


that
 is
 actually
 true.
 Like
 someone


still
 needs
 to
 construct
 all
 these
 power


plants
 or
 data
 centers
 and
 as
 long
 as


there's
 manual
 electricians
 and
 as
 long


as
 there's
 man
 maybe
 you
 don't
 need


manual
 architects
 but
 you
 probably
 need


manual
 plumbing
 for
 a
 while
 manual


electricians
 I
 don't
 think
 robots
 are


building
 the
 next
 data
 center
 at least


not
 right
 away
 and
 so
 that
 is
 going
 to


be
 the
 constraint
 and
 so
 these
 jobs
 are


not
 really
 going
 to
 go
 away.
 So
 some
 if


you
 read
 the
 bomb,
 you
 know,
 curse
 of


the
 bomb
 stuff,
 I
 think
 we're
 not
 going


to
 see
 radical
 disruption.
 We're
 just


going
 to
 see
 the
 golden
 age
 that
 Trump


talked
 about
 in
 his
 inaugural
 address.


>> Yeah.
 The
 We
 just
 had
 Sam
 Alman
 here


last
 week
 on
 the
 podcast.
 We
 were
 Yeah.


both
 investors.


>> I
 wore
 a
 much
 more
 subtle
 shirt.


>> Exactly.
 Um
 what
 is
 your
 mental
 model
 of


OpenAI
 as
 a
 company?
 What
 what
 what
 is


it
 doing
 right
 now?
 What
 is
 Yeah.
 How
 do


you
 sort
 of
 see
 it
 going
 forward?
 Well,


I
 I
 think
 there's
 several
 things
 they're


doing.
 Obviously,
 it's
 a
 phenomenal


company.
 It's
 the
 most
 important
 company


of
 the
 last
 decade.
 I
 think
 Chat
 GBT


becomes
 a
 monopoly.
 It's
 the
 fastest


growing
 consumer
 product
 of
 all
 time.
 It


is
 transforming
 how
 everybody,
 every


normal
 person
 basically
 does
 their
 work,


runs
 their
 life.
 And
 so
 that
 product


alone
 is
 a
 several
 trillion
 dollar


company.
 Then
 they
 do
 all
 these
 other


things.
 And
 some
 of
 them
 may
 pay


commercial
 dividends,
 some
 may
 pay


societal
 dividends,
 but
 Chad
 GBT
 alone


there
 is
 no
 competition
 for.
 It's
 not


like
 anthropic
 or
 all
 these
 other


companies
 have
 any
 competition
 for
 that.


There
 are
 vertical
 applications
 where


some
 foundational
 models
 or
 some
 geos


where
 some
 foundational
 models
 may


thrive
 and
 AI
 may
 be
 important
 enough


that
 even
 having
 a
 vertical
 application


like
 coding
 or
 having
 a
 vertical
 a
 geo


application
 may
 be
 worth
 tens
 of


billions
 of
 dollars.
 But
 open
 AI
 is
 the


few
 trillion
 dollar
 company.


the
 what
 happens
 to
 Google?


>> Good
 question.


I
 know
 it
 doesn't
 show
 up
 in
 all
 their


metrics.
 I
 know
 they're
 good
 at
 spinning


like,
 hey,
 it's
 not
 having
 effect
 on


this
 and
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 just
 survey,


you
 know,
 walk
 outside
 your
 office
 and


just
 ask
 10
 people
 like
 how
 how
 often


you
 go
 to
 Google
 versus
 how
 often
 do
 you


use
 chatbt?
 And
 yes,
 maybe
 you
 grow
 both


for
 a
 while,
 but
 I
 don't
 use
 Google
 for


anything.
 Like
 I
 can't
 remember
 the
 last


time
 I
 used
 Google
 versus
 chatbt.


Like
 it's
 just
 so
 inferior.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 Alex,
 I
 know
 you've
 thought
 a


lot
 about
 Google
 as
 well.
 What


>> I
 know
 their
 strategy.
 So
 their
 strategy


is
 going
 to
 be
 at
 some
 point
 they're


going
 to
 try
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 all


this
 personal
 data
 from
 your
 Gmail,
 from


your
 YouTube
 videos,
 you
 know,
 from
 all


the
 different
 products
 they
 have
 and


then
 therefore
 make
 a
 much
 better


personalized
 experience.
 And
 I
 think
 the


tradition
 the
 company
 being
 a


conservative
 institution
 and
 a
 legacy


sort
 of
 institution,
 they've
 moved
 very


slowly
 on
 that.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


data
 there
 and
 you
 could
 create
 a
 power


a
 very
 powerful
 personalized
 assistant


sort
 of
 proactive
 product
 and
 that's


what
 they
 should
 build.


The
 question
 is,
 can
 you
 get
 can
 chachib


get
 enough
 of
 my
 prompts
 over
 enough


period
 of
 time
 that
 they're
 creating
 an


equivalent
 data
 set
 about
 me
 that
 allows


them
 to
 compete
 on
 the
 personalization


basis.
 And
 the
 longer
 Google
 waits
 to


ship
 something
 like
 this
 that's
 robust,


the
 more
 time
 Chad
 GBT
 has
 to
 develop,


you
 know,
 sort
 of
 my
 personalized
 prompt


history
 which
 can
 inform
 the
 future
 and


then
 they
 can
 ship,
 you
 know,
 better


products,
 personal
 assistants,
 devices.


There's
 also
 a
 question
 around
 devices.


Does
 someone
 do
 you
 need
 a
 device?
 Is
 AI


driven
 by
 a
 new
 computing
 device
 and


who's
 going
 to
 build
 that?
 Obviously,


OpenAI
 made
 an
 acquisition
 to
 try
 to
 get


down
 that
 path.
 Google's
 been
 terrible


at
 devices
 historically.


We'll
 see
 if
 they
 can
 get
 any
 better,


but
 someone,
 you
 know,
 Apple
 is
 great
 at


devices
 but
 bad
 at
 AI.
 Someone
 is
 going


to
 build
 a
 device.
 Where
 are
 we
 going
 to


be
 using,
 you
 know,
 your
 iPhone
 as
 your


personal
 computing
 device
 5
 years
 out?


Maybe
 10
 years
 out
 almost
 surely
 not.


>> Do
 you
 do
 you
 know
 what
 that
 device


might
 be?


>> I
 personally
 am
 a
 fan
 of
 putting


something
 in
 your
 ear.
 Um
 I
 think
 first


of
 all
 I
 believe
 in
 the
 science
 fiction


movie
 adoption
 of
 like
 like
 Mission


Impossible.
 It's
 always
 in
 his
 ear.
 The


glasses
 have
 done
 reasonably
 well,
 but


if
 you
 know
 I
 have
 Lasix,


um
 I
 think
 most
 people
 who
 wear
 glasses


try
 to
 get
 Lasix
 at
 some
 point
 and
 so
 I


think
 putting
 another
 device
 here
 all


the
 time,
 the
 bar
 on
 the
 value


proposition
 goes
 up
 versus
 put
 something


in
 your
 ear,
 it
 might
 actually
 go
 down.


Um
 there
 are
 people
 with
 like
 pendants


and
 necklaces
 which
 have
 some
 value
 and


you
 may
 have
 multiple
 instead
 of
 having


a
 phone
 maybe
 you
 have
 something
 in
 your


ear
 and
 something
 here,
 something
 here.


Depends
 what
 the
 use
 case
 is,
 what
 the


ideal
 form
 factor
 is.
 There's
 issues


around
 battery
 innovation,
 too.
 Like


some
 of
 the
 stuff's
 really
 hard
 because


you
 need
 power,
 constant
 power.


Depending
 on
 where
 something's
 located,


it
 may
 be
 very
 difficult
 to
 power
 it
 or


not.
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it,


but
 if
 I
 had
 a
 vote,
 if
 I
 was
 running
 a


company
 that's
 doing
 hardware,
 I'd
 try


the
 year
 first.
 Interesting.


>> Alex,
 any
 reaction
 to
 this
 either
 on
 the


on
 the
 Google
 side
 or
 on
 the
 device


side?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 on
 the
 Google


side,
 I
 mean,
 you
 and
 I
 have
 talked


about
 this
 a
 bunch.
 Um,
 I
 don't
 think


Google's
 going
 to
 get
 hit
 for
 a
 long


time
 on
 the
 monetization
 part,
 but
 I


agree
 like
 all
 of
 the
 non-monetizing


searches
 go
 away
 first.
 It's
 like,
 you


know,
 how
 do
 I
 get
 here?
 What
 should
 I


prepare
 for
 this
 interview?
 Like
 all
 of


these
 things
 that
 aren't
 commerce


related,
 but
 like
 where
 do
 I
 buy
 a
 like


I
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 tennis
 racket
 right
 now?


Like
 that's
 Google
 until
 it
 isn't


because


>> So
 it
 isn't
 until
 you
 say
 show
 me
 the


best
 five
 tennis
 rackets
 for
 me.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 cuz
 like
 if
 you
 try
 try


that
 right
 now
 top
 10
 top
 five
 racket


choices
 for
 me
 on
 cha
 ch
 versus
 Google


search


>> right


>> I
 think
 even
 already
 now
 cha
 chibi
 would


be
 better


>> well
 it's
 it's
 where
 it
 will
 really
 be


better
 is
 um
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 it's
 like


there's
 impulse
 buys
 which
 won't
 really


be be
 hit
 by
 either
 because
 that's
 just


like
 I'm
 looking
 at
 Instagram
 I
 see


something
 that
 I
 shouldn't
 buy
 anyway


and
 then
 there's
 highly
 highly


considered
 purchases
 like
 buying
 a
 house


we'll
 get
 to
 that
 later
 with
 the
 door


and
 everything
 else
 but
 and
 then
 in
 the


middle
 um
 this
 is
 something
 where
 I


think
 AI
 eventually
 will
 do
 a
 phenomenal


up,
 which
 is
 like,
 I
 want
 this
 skew,


this
 tennis
 racket.
 Buy
 it
 for
 me
 right


now
 at
 the
 lowest
 price.
 You're
 not


going
 to
 go
 through
 Google
 and
 like
 look


at
 coupons
 and
 like
 all
 that
 crap
 is


going
 to
 go
 away.
 You
 will
 just
 go
 to


chat
 GPT
 or
 to
 your
 point,
 like
 it's


possible
 that
 the
 Empire
 Strikes
 Back,


but
 like
 the
 like,
 all
 right,
 I
 I


already
 have
 my
 calendar,
 my
 Gmail,


everything
 else.
 That
 personalization


potentially
 makes
 it
 better.
 But
 the


execute
 on
 this
 skew
 and
 buy
 it
 for
 me.


If
 chat
 GBT
 get
 it
 gets
 that
 going,


which
 I
 think
 is
 one
 of
 their
 top


priorities,
 then
 like
 that's
 that's


going
 to
 really
 steal
 the
 monetization


engine
 by
 from
 Google
 because
 like


that's
 where
 they
 make
 all
 their
 money.


>> I
 mean,
 but
 imagine
 a
 couple
 things.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 like
 the
 example,


if
 you
 have
 Gmail,
 you
 probably
 can


figure
 out
 what
 tennis
 rackets
 I


purchased
 previously.
 I
 mean,
 if
 I


bought
 in
 the
 real
 world,
 maybe
 not.
 But


if
 I
 bought
 them
 online
 in
 my
 receipts,


you
 know,
 they're
 going to
 be
 in
 my


Gmail.
 Um,
 but
 then
 the
 other
 hand
 on


Chad
 GBT,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 say
 I
 prompt


like,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 this
 ranked
 tennis


player,
 better
 at
 forehand
 than


backhand,
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah,
 you


know,
 etc.
 Which
 racket's
 best
 for
 me.


And
 I
 can't
 even
 fathom
 like
 how
 to
 do
 a


Google
 search
 that
 would
 be
 something


like
 that.


>> It's
 more
 of
 like
 Google
 has
 this
 like


complete
 inventory,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 that


advantage
 will
 not
 hold
 for
 long.
 And
 I


think
 the
 metrics
 that
 they're
 kind
 of


faking
 right
 now
 is
 it's
 like
 what


percentage
 of
 our
 users
 are
 using
 AI
 and


that's
 not
 using
 Gemini
 as
 a
 DAOU.
 I'm


sure
 of
 that.
 It's
 just
 like
 they
 had


like
 an
 AI
 summary
 something
 something


in
 there
 but
 they're
 losing
 all
 of
 the


free
 in
 the
 premium
 sense
 searches
 to


chat
 GPT.


>> So
 eventually
 that's
 going
 to
 catch
 up


with
 them.
 Well,
 also
 Chhatty
 Boutique


is
 uh
 fixing
 the
 first
 sin
 of
 the


internet,
 which
 is
 they
 charge


subscriptions.
 And
 so
 to
 some
 extent,


you
 may
 not
 have
 to
 rebuild
 an


advertising
 model
 if
 your
 subscription


revenue
 is
 excellent.
 Consumers
 are


basically
 learning
 that
 they
 should
 pay


for
 things
 that
 create
 value,
 which
 has


always
 been
 true
 offline.
 Like
 there's


almost
 nothing
 you
 consume
 offline


except
 oxygen
 that
 you
 don't
 pay
 for.


But
 online,
 the
 first
 generation
 of


internet
 entrepreneurs
 assumed
 you
 had


to
 make
 things
 free.
 They
 sort
 of


equated
 the
 marginal
 cost
 reduction
 with


the
 value
 reduction
 and
 it
 was
 just
 a


massive
 mistake.
 And
 Chad
 GBT
 is
 now


fixing
 that
 where
 people
 are
 going
 to


pay
 for
 AI
 products
 directly
 whether


it's
 $200
 a
 month,
 $20
 a
 month
 or
 even


$2,000
 a
 month.


>> And
 yet
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 merchants
 will


still
 pay
 for
 traffic.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you
 can
 do
 hybrid,
 but
 then
 you


can
 offset
 some
 of
 Google's
 advantages


if
 you're
 already
 monetizing
 users


through
 subscriptions
 successfully.


>> Yeah.


>> Let's
 let's
 talk
 more
 broadly
 about
 how


incumbents
 are
 are
 going
 to
 be
 affected.


You
 we
 just
 talked
 about
 Google
 Keith.


I'm
 curious
 to
 hear
 your
 thoughts
 when


we
 look
 at
 the
 next
 5
 to
 10
 years
 like


how
 d
 you
 know
 companies
 like
 Amazon,


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 how
 do
 you
 think


they're
 going
 to
 handle?


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 I
 don't
 know


what
 Amazon's
 going
 to
 do.
 Um
 it
 has
 the


selection
 and
 the
 delivery.
 I
 mean
 still


you're
 there's
 a
 fulfillment
 one
 way
 or


the
 other's
 a
 fulfillment
 aspect
 which


is
 never
 been
 Google's
 strength.
 They've


tried
 various
 initiatives
 none
 of
 them


work.
 uh
 never
 been
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


chatbt
 actually
 fulfilling
 most
 likely


>> well
 most
 of their
 gross
 profit
 is
 AWS


like
 that
 is
 the


>> vast
 another
 issue
 too
 structurally
 like


maybe
 they
 don't
 even
 care
 to
 some


extent
 at
 some
 point
 but
 um
 I
 think
 the


fulfillment's
 very
 real
 and
 Amazon
 is


actually
 on
 fulfillment
 not
 that
 many


people
 are
 although
 e-commerce


fulfillment
 is
 somewhat
 distinct


from
 traditional
 fulfillment
 so
 we'll


see
 if
 there's
 room
 for
 innovation
 there


but
 they
 could
 hold
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time


of
 being
 the
 reliable
 delivery


mechanism.
 Um,
 you
 get
 satisficing,
 you


get
 a
 reasonable
 price
 and
 quality


experience
 and
 that's
 good
 enough.
 So


maybe
 that
 sustains
 them
 for
 a
 bit.


Microsoft,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 you


know
 people
 gave
 them
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 up


front
 for
 their
 investing
 in
 AI,
 forging


this
 relationship
 and
 partnership
 with


Open
 AI
 before
 it
 was
 obvious
 that
 Open


AI
 was
 going
 to
 transform
 all
 of
 our


lives,
 society,
 industries,
 etc.


But
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years,
 it's
 not


clear
 that
 they
 have
 been
 able
 to


preserve
 that
 advantage.


>> And
 now
 if
 you
 think
 about
 business


applications,


do
 you
 really
 think
 that
 Microsoft
 has


an
 advantage
 in
 business
 applications?


Not
 in
 LinkedIn,
 not
 in
 Word,
 probably


not
 in
 Excel.
 They're
 holding
 on
 to


Excel,
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 startups,


you've
 probably
 funded
 a
 few
 around


here,
 that
 are,
 you
 know,
 AI
 for
 Excel


and
 things
 like
 that.
 Keynote
 or


PowerPoint.
 I
 doubt
 they
 can
 hold
 on
 to


that,


you
 know,
 cloud
 revenue.
 Sure,
 for
 the


point
 about
 AWS
 or
 Google
 Cloud,
 um,
 but


that's
 not
 really
 why
 Microsoft's
 valued


the
 way
 they
 are.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 what


their
 advantage
 that's
 going
 to
 sustain


through
 the
 AI
 AI
 wave
 is
 going
 to
 be.


>> Well,
 historically,
 it's
 always
 been
 a


distribution
 advantage
 where
 they've


just
 crushed
 everybody
 and
 it's
 like
 you


go
 back
 to
 Lotus
 123
 or
 whatever.
 pick


your
 pick
 your
 company
 and
 it's
 like


they
 just
 have
 this
 dominant
 browsers.


>> They
 will
 just
 they'll
 clone
 you,


they'll
 crush
 you
 and
 then
 they'll


distribute
 the
 heck
 out
 of
 their


shittier
 product
 and
 then


>> Teams.


>> Yeah,
 Teams
 is
 a
 perfect
 example.
 It's


like
 Zoom
 had
 a
 higher
 market
 cap
 than


Exop.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 And
 then
 they
 like
 totally


flipped
 after
 like
 COVID
 reversed
 and


Teams
 is
 just
 but
 it's
 actually
 not


because
 of
 Exxon,
 right?
 It's
 it's


because
 of
 it's
 not
 even
 because
 of
 CO


restrictions
 or
 interest
 rates.
 They're


losing
 but
 they
 started
 with
 they


started
 with
 an
 advantage
 in
 coding


co-pilot
 etc.
 they're
 losing
 that
 cur


cursor
 or
 cognition
 and
 maybe
 others.


>> But
 it
 feels
 like
 developers
 are
 much


more
 attuned
 to
 like
 I
 want
 good


software
 whereas
 if
 you're
 like
 an
 Oompa


Loompa
 at
 a
 big
 company
 and
 you're
 just


like
 you're
 using
 Microsoft
 Office,
 it's


just
 like
 you're
 using
 Microsoft
 Office


whereas
 like
 developer
 like
 really


really
 high-end
 developers
 like
 of


course
 they're
 going
 to
 use
 cursor
 over


like
 Microsoft
 Copilot.
 But
 I
 wonder
 if


office
 even
 has
 a
 future
 like
 this
 is


where
 you
 know
 when
 people
 write
 stuff
 I


mean
 obviously
 Microsoft
 Word
 was


default
 way
 most
 humans
 have
 been


writing
 stuff
 for
 like
 20
 years
 although


I
 grew
 up
 with
 word
 perfect
 but
 the


point
 yeah


>> um
 but
 um
 are
 people
 with
 the
 way
 you


know
 AI
 writes
 chatbt
 writes
 for
 you
 and


increasingly
 better
 and
 are
 there


specialized
 versions
 of
 that
 do
 people


draft
 documents
 in
 word
 in
 three
 four


five
 years
 probably
 not
 well


>> it's
 also
 like
 this
 classic
 disruption


theory
 of
 like
 Microsoft
 Word
 has


overshot
 the
 market,
 right?
 It's
 like


there
 are
 9
 million
 features
 in


Microsoft
 Word
 that
 I
 never
 use.
 Like
 do


I
 need
 to
 make
 a
 table
 of
 content


contents
 generator
 for
 my
 book?
 Like
 no.


And
 like
 to
 a
 certain
 extent
 like
 Google


Docs
 like
 that
 was
 pillaried
 when
 it


came
 out
 because
 it's
 like
 oh
 it
 doesn't


do
 the
 table
 of
 contents
 generator
 or


whatever.
 But
 like
 Microsoft
 Word
 has


overshot
 the
 market
 but
 they
 do
 have
 the


distribution
 which
 is
 which
 I
 think
 is


the
 hardest.
 Chachi
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in


every
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 on
 everybody's


phone
 or
 device
 and
 like
 so
 for
 example


I
 was
 considering
 writing
 a
 book


everybody's
 always
 like
 you
 should
 write


a
 book
 so
 I
 was
 like
 chachi
 write
 me
 a


book


>> and
 it's
 a
 pretty
 good
 you
 know
 sort
 of


first
 draft
 I'm
 not
 that
 book's
 not


going
 to
 get
 written
 in
 Microsoft
 Word


as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell


>> if
 it's
 ever
 written


>> it's
 crazy
 to
 think
 that
 for
 a
 day
 Sam


Alman
 was
 conceivably
 going
 to
 join


Microsoft
 or
 like


>> yeah
 for
 like
 24
 hours
 until
 Venode
 and


some
 other
 friends
 intervened
 a
 fair


amount


>> I
 guess
 I
 asked
 to
 ask
 did
 Microsoft


sort
 of
 drop
 the
 ball
 on
 their


relationship
 with
 like
 could
 they
 have


capitalized
 in
 a
 much
 bigger
 way
 or
 was


it
 just


>> I
 don't
 know
 you
 know
 the
 talent
 there's


a
 complexity
 around
 talent
 like
 you
 know


individual
 people
 if
 there's
 only
 150


people
 that
 could
 build
 research
 models


successfully
 talent's
 going
 to
 have
 a


lot
 of
 power
 and
 if
 the
 talent
 doesn't


want
 to
 work
 for
 Microsoft


there there
 may
 not
 be
 economics
 there
 I


mean
 meta's
 trying
 this
 of
 like
 can
 you


use
 economic
 leverage
 to
 force
 people
 to


work
 there
 um
 you
 know
 and
 we'll
 see


we'll
 see
 what
 the
 results
 are.
 It's
 not


a
 bad
 idea.
 Like
 I
 actually
 think
 Mark's


clever.
 He
 mints
 more
 money
 than
 most.


Take
 the
 money
 and
 use
 it.
 It's
 like


imagine
 you're
 competing
 in
 sports.


>> Yeah.


>> Mark
 doesn't
 really
 have
 a
 salary
 cap.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 why
 not
 try
 to
 pay
 the
 highest


salaries?
 Now
 there
 are
 issues
 when
 you


do
 that
 and
 he's
 running
 into
 some
 of


those,
 but
 it's
 a
 relatively
 coherent


strategy
 for
 Meta
 to
 try
 it.


>> I
 just
 worry
 I
 I
 wonder
 I
 shouldn't
 even


say
 I
 worry
 like
 the
 moral
 hazard
 of


it's
 like
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 what


went
 wrong
 with
 like
 crypto
 1.0.
 Yeah.


where
 it's
 like
 I'm
 gonna
 give
 you
 tons


of
 money
 upfront
 and
 normally
 the
 way


that
 you
 build
 a
 startup
 is
 you
 build


the
 startup,
 you
 work
 really
 hard
 and


then
 at
 the
 end
 you
 get
 the
 Ferrari.


>> And
 if
 you
 get
 the
 Ferrari
 first,
 will


you
 still
 build
 the
 hard
 start?
 And
 like


the
 people
 that
 are
 in
 it
 for
 the
 love


of
 the
 game,
 they
 will.


>> They
 will.
 But
 then
 can
 you
 tell
 the


difference?
 Can
 you
 discern
 the


difference?
 In
 sports,
 it
 kind
 of
 works


where
 you
 guarantee
 contracts
 in
 some


sports.
 Um,
 but
 maybe
 that's
 because


there's
 such
 statistical
 measurements
 of


people's
 performance.
 Um,
 and
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 in
 sports
 are
 just
 so


dedicated,
 love
 the
 game.
 whatever
 so


passion
 about
 what
 they
 do
 they
 can't


imagine
 doing
 anything
 else
 but
 I
 I


think
 this
 could
 backfire
 but
 it
 is
 a


coherent
 strategy
 for
 a
 company
 that
 was


losing
 AI
 race
 to
 try
 something


different
 leveraging
 that
 they
 make


probably
 other
 you
 know
 the
 Apple
 could


have
 done
 this
 but
 so
 culturally
 foreign


Apple
 could
 have
 competed
 on
 dollars


they
 made
 more
 money
 than
 anybody
 else


like
 their
 profits
 are
 greater
 than
 like


Google's
 revenues
 or
 something
 um


something
 like
 that
 I
 haven't
 done
 the


math
 recently
 but
 it's
 pretty
 comparable


but
 culturally
 that
 just
 wouldn't
 work


at
 Apple
 and
 so
 it
 became
 a
 non-starter


but
 they're
 going to
 have
 to
 figure
 out


something
 or
 they're
 going to
 be


irrelevant
 at
 some
 point
 too,


>> right?
 Once
 the
 device
 question
 comes


into
 play.


>> Yes.
 Well,
 that
 that's
 what's
 saving


Apple
 right
 now
 is
 the
 combin
 the


vertical
 integration
 required
 to
 build
 a


device
 successfully
 is
 something
 that
 no


other
 company
 at
 least
 in
 the
 west
 knows


how
 to
 do
 because
 you
 do
 need
 software,


you
 need
 hardware
 expertise.
 You
 also


need
 like
 the
 ability
 to
 compete
 on


batteries
 and
 chips
 and
 like
 there's


four
 or
 five
 different
 things
 you
 have


to
 be
 pretty
 excellent
 at.
 But
 someone


will


figure
 out
 a
 solution
 at
 some
 point.


>> Well,
 it
 feels
 like
 they're
 looking
 at


it
 like
 you
 know
 every
 Samsung
 phone


when
 it
 comes
 out
 has
 a
 better
 camera


for
 like
 you
 know
 a
 week
 or
 a
 year
 or


whatever
 than
 Apple
 or
 like
 you
 know
 now


the
 Samsung
 phone
 folds
 in
 half
 or
 it


has
 all
 these
 advanced
 features
 that


really
 aren't
 for
 the
 mainstream
 and


Apple
 has
 always
 been
 like
 we're
 going


to
 wait.
 We're
 going
 to
 make
 it
 better


but
 like
 they're
 not
 the
 first.


>> Yeah.
 And
 like
 AI
 strikes
 me
 as
 a
 little


bit
 different
 than
 that
 because
 number


one
 it's
 software.
 Um
 so
 it's
 not
 like


we
 have
 to
 go
 get
 the
 world's
 greatest


AI
 right
 now
 and
 put
 it
 in
 in
 day
 zero.


And
 this
 whole
 we're
 going
 to
 wait
 three


years.
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 such
 a
 lost


opportunity.
 I'm
 convinced
 that
 like


traffic
 fatalities
 would
 go
 down
 in
 this


country
 if
 Siri
 actually
 work.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 Like
 there's
 so
 many
 things
 where


they
 could
 make
 it
 better
 but
 they're


treating
 it
 I
 mean
 at least
 from
 the


outside
 in
 like
 oh
 this
 is
 like
 you
 know


Samsung
 has
 a
 400
 megapixel
 camera
 or


something.
 We're
 going
 to
 wait
 on
 that


one
 and
 not
 get
 it
 right.
 And
 like
 they


just
 announced
 like
 you
 know
 why
 doesn't


Siri
 work?
 It's
 an
 embarrassment
 in
 2025


when
 chat
 GBT
 is
 like
 AGI
 like
 I
 mean


maybe
 not
 by
 like
 current
 researchers


but
 like
 10
 years
 ago
 we
 would
 have
 said


this
 is
 AGI
 and
 like
 Siri
 is
 just
 as
 bad


as
 it
 was
 in
 2015.
 It's
 just
 remarkable.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 just
 to
 close
 the
 loop
 on
 this


Keith
 what's
 your
 perspective
 on
 Meta's


um
 sort
 of
 durability
 or
 defensibility


or
 strategy
 going
 forward?


Well,
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 I
 think
 the


approach
 is
 interesting
 because
 when
 you


want
 any
 strategy,
 whether
 you're
 a


venture
 capitalist
 or
 an
 entrepreneur


has
 to
 take
 advant
 you
 want
 to
 leverage


the
 advantages
 you
 have
 and
 maximize


those.
 And
 so
 cash
 is
 one
 that
 Meta
 has.


And
 so
 trying
 to
 leverage
 that
 smart,


but
 they
 still
 need
 the
 ability
 to
 ship


products.
 And
 so
 for
 Google's
 weakness


has
 always
 been
 they
 just
 don't
 ship


products.
 like
 they
 have
 ideas,
 they


have
 researchers,
 they
 have
 lots
 of


money
 flushing
 around,
 but
 when
 is
 the


last
 time
 Google
 launched
 an
 interesting


product?


>> Gmail
 was
 pretty
 good.


>> Yeah.
 2008.


>> 2004.


>> Before
 Yeah,
 actually
 that's
 right.
 So,


um
 yeah.
 Um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 did


when
 did
 they
 do
 maps?
 Like
 2005,


something
 like
 that.
 Brett
 when
 did


Brett
 do
 maps?
 Like
 it
 was
 something


like
 that.
 Um
 and
 then
 you
 know
 they


acquired
 some
 things
 like
 YouTube


whatever
 but
 like
 launched
 a
 coherent


product.
 No,
 actually
 Whimo
 would
 in


some
 ways
 count,
 but
 it's
 it's
 actually


won't
 help
 with
 this
 problem.
 Um,
 as
 far


as
 I
 can
 tell.
 Um,
 but
 like
 a
 a
 true


sort
 of
 consumer
 product.
 I'm
 not
 sure


they
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it,


>> right?
 That
 that's
 Google
 and
 the
 meta.


The
 question
 is
 how
 defensible
 is
 their


the
 graph
 that
 they've
 built?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 graph
 is


defensible.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 other


assets
 that
 are.
 I
 think
 the
 graph
 has


kind
 of
 been
 weakened
 by
 like
 Tik
 Tok


has
 kind
 of
 shown
 that
 on
 social


products
 the
 graph
 may
 certainly
 isn't


in
 is
 not
 indispensable
 to
 success
 and


may
 even
 be
 a
 handicap.
 Ax
 is
 you've


moved
 from
 a
 people
 you
 follow
 to
 a
 for


you
 feed
 which
 is
 the
 default
 and


probably
 how
 all
 of
 us
 engage
 with
 axe


has
 also
 made
 the
 graph
 fairly


irrelevant.
 Well,
 there
 there's
 a


question
 people
 are
 asking
 with
 Sora,


which
 is,
 hey,
 if
 your
 friends
 can
 make


as
 good
 content
 as,
 you
 know,


professional
 content
 makers,
 which
 is
 a


big
 if,
 but
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 maybe
 you


want
 the
 best
 of
 both
 worlds,
 which
 is


you
 want
 the
 social
 and
 you
 want
 the


highest
 quality
 stuff


>> ideally,
 but
 also
 Reddit,
 like
 Reddit's


a
 42
 billion
 or
 $40
 billion
 market
 cap


company.
 No
 graph,


>> right?


>> So,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 graph
 was
 very


valuable
 to
 be
 clear.


>> Yeah.


>> I'm
 just
 not
 sure
 it's
 valuable
 in
 the


future.


>> Let's
 get
 into
 real
 estate.
 Let's
 get


into
 open
 door.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 we
 recently


had
 Cass
 on
 as
 well.
 Why
 did
 open
 door


lose
 its
 way?
 What
 were
 the
 mistakes


that
 were
 made?
 And
 let's
 talk
 about
 how


we're
 going to
 fix.


>> Well,
 there
 was
 two.
 One
 was


predictable.
 Venode
 actually
 warned
 Eric


and
 me
 about
 this
 in
 2015


that
 real
 estate
 has
 a
 cycl
 cyclical


nature
 to
 it
 and
 you
 need
 to
 make
 sure


that
 your
 cost
 structure
 will
 be


acceptable
 when
 you
 hit
 the
 lows
 of
 that


cycle.
 So
 he's
 basically
 get
 as
 many


variable
 costs
 built
 into
 your
 company


culture
 and
 as
 low
 fixed
 costs
 as


possible
 and
 then
 you
 don't
 care
 like
 so


real
 estate
 residential
 real
 estate


people's
 intuition
 on
 this
 is
 very
 very


off
 the
 low
 market
 like
 when
 people


think
 real
 estate's
 dead
 4
 million
 homes


transact
 a
 year
 high
 in
 the
 market
 six


so
 you
 have
 four
 to
 six
 million


transactions
 a
 year
 you
 need
 to
 build


your
 cost
 structure
 that
 you
 can
 be


break
 even
 or
 not
 you
 know
 incredibly


unprofitable
 at
 4
 million
 transactions
 a


and
 Eric
 and
 me
 collectively
 did
 not
 do


that
 from
 2015
 2019.
 So
 when
 the
 Fed


started
 raising
 interest
 rates
 and
 it


actually
 did
 raise
 interest
 rates
 six


times
 in
 a
 very
 compressed
 period
 of


time
 which
 is
 the
 fastest
 rate
 of


interest
 rate
 uh
 hikes


the
 company
 then
 went
 from
 5
 a.5
 million


transactions
 a
 year
 as
 a
 market
 as
 a
 TAM


to
 four


and
 immediately
 started
 burning
 money.


An
 extreme
 example
 of
 this
 that


clarifies
 my
 point
 I
 think
 is
 what


happened
 to
 Airbnb
 co
 the
 first
 month


Airbnb
 is
 a
 wonderful
 business
 one
 of


the
 best
 network
 effect
 businesses
 maybe


the
 best
 of
 all
 time
 13%
 kind
 of
 margin


take
 rate
 whatever
 and
 all
 of a
 sudden


COVID
 happens
 and
 nobody's
 traveling


anywhere
 companies
 had
 a
 very
 bloated


cost
 structure
 too
 but
 nobody
 noticed


because
 they're
 minting
 money
 nobody


travels
 guess
 what
 all
 that
 gna
 is
 pure


burn
 and
 they
 almost
 went
 bankrupt
 until


they
 structured
 this
 very
 complicated


deal
 with
 silver
 which
 saved
 the


company.
 Open
 dooror
 had
 that
 problem


but
 less
 excusable
 co
 is
 kind
 of
 these


true
 black
 swans
 that
 you
 really
 don't


have
 to
 typically
 build
 your
 business


taking
 uh
 taking
 account
 for
 in
 real


estate
 you
 should
 take
 account
 for
 the


idea
 that
 this
 would
 happen
 so
 anyway


basically
 that's
 what
 happened
 openor


then
 secondly
 as
 Eric
 decided
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 be
 CEO
 anymore
 the
 board
 for
 a


variety
 of
 reasons
 promoted
 this


completely
 mediocre
 CFO
 which
 is
 almost


always
 a
 bad
 idea
 to
 be
 CEO
 and
 she
 went


from
 mediocre
 to
 like
 the
 worst
 CEO
 on


the
 planet.
 Um,
 so
 the
 company
 for
 3


years
 did
 every
 possible
 thing
 you
 could


do
 wrong.
 It
 still
 survived
 barely,
 but


um,
 like
 literally
 the
 dumbest
 possible


things,
 partnering
 with
 agents,
 shutting


down
 innovation,
 hiring
 people
 overseas,


adopting
 DEI
 writ
 large,
 every
 possible


mistake,
 stupidass
 capital
 markets


decisions,
 underinvesting
 in
 uh,
 what
 we


call
 AVM,
 automated
 valuation,
 every


possible
 mistake.
 So,
 the
 good
 news
 is


you
 can
 get
 like
 10x
 value
 just
 by


unwinding
 those
 mistakes,
 which
 Cass
 is


definitely
 doing.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 even
 his


first
 month,
 I
 think
 he'll
 get
 half
 of


those
 unwound,
 maybe
 even
 more,
 like


just
 in
 one
 month
 because
 he,
 you
 know,


faster.
 Um,
 but,
 uh,
 it's
 just
 like


literally
 the
 more
 you
 dig
 in,
 it's
 kind


of
 like
 Biden.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 Trump


trying
 to
 cover
 Biden.
 It's
 like
 if
 I


just
 stopped
 doing
 every
 stupid
 thing


that
 Biden
 did,
 like
 the
 world
 would
 be


so
 much
 better.
 And
 like
 I
 don't
 have
 to


really
 do
 any
 innovation.
 I
 just
 have
 to


stop
 doing
 stupid
 The
 immigration


border
 is
 a
 perfect
 example.
 Like


literally
 on
 day
 one
 he's
 just
 we're


going
 to
 stop
 like
 enticing
 people
 to


come
 here
 and
 all
 of a
 sudden
 like


border
 crossings
 go
 from
 like
 here
 to


here
 like
 in
 24
 hours.
 So
 like
 that's


like
 open
 door.
 It's
 like
 basically


border
 crossings
 like
 we
 had
 Biden


running
 the
 company
 about
 about
 as


competently.


>> So
 what's
 your
 what's
 your
 wish?
 You


know
 uh
 in
 our
 last
 episode
 with
 Cass


Alex
 fleshed
 out
 kind
 of
 his
 Amazon
 for


homes
 thesis
 why
 he
 got
 so
 excited
 about


you
 know
 leading
 our
 investment
 in
 the


company.
 What's
 your
 um
 where
 where
 are


you
 excited?
 Well,
 here's
 my
 I'll
 give


you
 the
 top
 down
 thesis
 which
 I've


shared
 publicly
 before
 is
 in
 2017
 I
 had


dinner
 with
 Yuri
 and
 Max
 Lein
 and
 Yuri


asked
 this
 question.
 He's
 like
 what's


the
 largest
 market
 cap
 company
 on
 the


planet
 in
 residential
 real
 estate?


And
 I
 assume
 there
 must
 be
 something


outside
 the
 United
 States
 and
 that's
 why


he
 was
 asking
 the
 question.
 Turns
 out


the
 time
 the
 answer
 was
 Zillow
 at
 18


bill
 and
 it's
 insane.
 the
 largest
 asset


class
 period
 that
 of
 30
 we've
 basically


been
 innovating
 a
 technology
 consumer


technology
 call
 it
 30
 years
 like
 1995


let's
 say
 to
 now
 30
 years
 that
 in
 the


largest
 asset
 class
 in
 the
 world
 for


consumers
 that
 the
 largest
 market
 cap


company
 that
 would
 take
 advantage
 of
 any


technology
 would
 be
 $18
 billion
 makes


absolutely
 no
 sense
 like
 that's
 like


insane.
 Um,
 so
 our
 goal
 is
 to
 reinvent


the
 process
 of
 buying
 and
 selling
 a


home.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 that,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 worth
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars.
 Now,
 it's
 difficult
 to
 do
 that


successfully,
 completely
 reinventing
 the


process
 of
 buying
 and
 selling
 a
 large


asset.
 But
 it's
 not
 impossible.
 Um,


things
 that,
 you
 know,
 eBay
 did
 back
 in


1995
 to
 2003
 apply
 to
 homes.
 Carvana
 has


mastered
 this
 applied
 to
 automotive


which
 for
 a
 normal
 American
 there's


actually
 sometimes
 people
 are
 like
 oh


there's
 nothing
 like
 in
 common
 between


autos
 and
 homes
 but
 that's
 often
 very


wealthy
 people
 who
 have
 like
 a
 $40


million
 home
 in
 Palo
 Alto
 or
 Athetherton


and
 they
 drive
 you
 know
 if
 they
 drive
 at


all
 like
 a
 100k
 car
 or
 something
 like


that
 Tesla
 or
 something


most
 Americans
 have
 a
 5
 to10
 ratio
 more


like
 10
 now
 but
 like
 a
 reasonable
 ratio


between
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 value
 of
 their


car
 and
 their
 home.
 So,
 you're
 only


talking
 about
 an
 order
 magnitude


difference.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 we
 should


be
 as
 valuable
 and
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we


do
 are
 very
 comparable
 to
 what
 Carvana


does.
 We
 actually
 have
 less
 competition


than
 Carvana.
 Carvana
 actually
 has
 been


incredibly
 successful
 given
 that
 there


were
 very
 significant
 competitors
 that


were
 innovative
 that
 they
 were
 competing


with,
 but
 it's
 a
 plus
 or
 minus
 a
 $40


billion
 company.
 And
 if
 we
 just
 get
 the


same
 multiples
 on
 what
 they
 do,
 we'll
 be


worth
 tens
 of
 billions
 to
 50
 billion.


That's
 like
 the
 base
 case.


>> I
 want
 I
 want
 to
 segue
 to
 fintech.
 You


guys
 are
 among
 two
 of
 the
 best
 fintech


investors
 and,
 you
 know,
 founders,


operators,
 uh,
 in
 the
 world.
 What
 is


the,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 the
 state
 of


fintech
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 are
 we


actively
 looking
 for
 for for


investments?
 Um,
 and
 how
 we
 think
 about


it.
 Keith,
 why
 don't
 you
 start?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 lots
 of
 promising


fintech
 companies.
 It's
 always
 been


difficult.
 Like
 the
 reality
 is
 I


personally
 have
 a
 view
 that
 to
 be


successful
 as
 a
 fintech
 innovation
 you


want
 an
 underwriting
 advantage
 and
 a


distribution
 advantage.
 If
 you
 have
 both


then
 you
 can
 build
 a
 really
 epic


company.
 If
 you
 have
 one
 you
 might
 be


able
 to
 build
 a
 pretty
 solid
 company.
 A


firm
 which
 we
 were
 both
 involved
 in
 um


had
 both
 underwriting
 mispric
 certain


kinds
 of
 people
 were
 mispriced.
 We're


going
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 different
 way
 to


underwrite
 based
 upon
 other
 things
 and
 a


distribution
 a
 very
 clever
 distribution


hack
 that
 other
 people
 have
 now
 copied


but
 basically
 was
 very
 innovative
 at
 the


time.
 And
 that's
 why
 firms,
 you
 know,


$25
 billion
 company
 with
 still
 upside.


Um,
 but
 I
 think
 those
 are
 rare
 to
 find.


Um,
 if
 you
 find
 them,
 the
 world's
 still


open
 for
 innovation.
 It's
 not
 like
 the


world's
 incredibly
 efficient
 around


financial
 services.
 Uh,
 we
 have
 some


very
 successful
 ones
 that
 have
 been


built
 over
 the
 last
 5
 years
 that
 now


need
 to
 infuse
 more
 AI,
 but
 they're
 not


they're
 not
 predicated
 on
 AI.
 And
 I


actually
 kind
 of
 like
 that
 because
 you


could
 argue
 there's
 an
 AI
 overinvestment


sort
 of
 cycle
 going
 on.
 And
 arguably
 one


way
 to
 kind
 of
 create
 uh
 a
 portfolio


that's
 not
 as
 sensitive
 to
 AI
 valuations


is
 financial
 services
 innovation
 which


still
 requires
 distribution
 and


innovation
 around
 underwriting.
 There's


also
 this
 kind
 of
 question
 of
 like


there's
 bits
 and
 atoms
 like
 you


mentioned
 vomals
 cost
 disease
 right
 it's


like
 you
 know
 plumbing
 healthcare
 like


all
 of
 these
 things
 that
 are
 so


atomcentric
 that
 will
 be
 atomcentric
 for


a
 long
 time
 until
 we
 have
 sentient


robots
 or
 something
 whereas
 every


financial
 services
 product
 that
 I
 know


of
 except
 for
 like
 the
 delivery
 of


physical
 gold
 ingots
 like
 it's
 all
 bits


so
 there
 probably
 is
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


upside
 for
 for
 AI
 but
 you
 still
 have
 to


get
 the
 distribution
 which
 is
 really


hard
 like
 consumer
 fintech
 products
 are


so
 hard
 because
 like
 all
 of
 the
 I
 mean


right
 now
 all
 of
 the
 the
 economic
 rent


goes
 to
 Google
 or
 wherever
 you
 fund
 it


from.


>> Um,
 but
 for
 the
 ones
 that
 unlock


distribution,
 it's
 like
 number
 one,
 you


could
 bring
 down
 the
 variable
 costs
 that


you
 were
 talking
 about
 with
 AI.
 And
 then


number
 two,
 it's
 like
 there
 are
 I
 think


there
 are
 so
 many
 things
 right
 now
 in


the
 world,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 my
 view
 on
 AI


where
 it's
 like
 cost
 is
 here
 just
 for


any
 any
 object,
 any
 delivery
 of
 service


and
 value
 is
 here.
 So
 if
 you
 just
 keep


value
 here,
 like
 you're
 not
 trying
 to


change
 the
 value
 equation,
 but
 you
 can


bring
 the
 cost
 down.
 Now
 you've
 unlocked


a
 new
 market
 that
 just
 didn't
 exist


before.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 it's
 almost
 hard
 to
 articulate


what
 those
 are
 until
 you
 see
 them.
 But


like
 it's
 like
 oh
 yeah
 like
 people


wanted
 that.
 It's
 like
 um
 you
 know


>> well
 Square
 was
 a
 quintessential
 example


that
 everybody
 thought
 there
 was
 no


market
 for
 Square
 like
 including
 very


smart
 pe
 like
 lots
 of
 very
 smart
 people


that
 we
 both
 know


>> because
 you
 couldn't
 really
 prove
 that


everybody
 really
 wanted
 to
 accept
 like


credit
 pay
 credit
 card
 based
 payments


until
 you
 actually
 gave
 them
 real
 people


the
 option
 to
 do
 it.
 It
 made
 it
 so


simple,
 easy,
 intuitive
 that
 they
 didn't


have
 to
 think
 about
 it.
 And
 then
 it's


massive
 market,
 right?


>> Or
 like
 it's
 I'm
 on
 the
 board
 of
 a


company
 called
 Wise
 and
 Wise
 has
 shown


that
 like
 the
 market
 this
 kind
 of
 makes


sense
 in
 retrospect,
 but
 like
 the
 market


for
 real-time
 delivery
 of
 cash
 is
 just


so
 much
 bigger
 than
 the
 market
 for
 like


you
 get
 it
 two
 days
 later.


>> Yeah.
 Cash
 Well,
 Cash
 App,
 this
 is
 this


is
 the monetization
 strategy
 beyond
 Cash


App.
 Cash
 App
 makes
 money
 now.
 The


reason
 why
 is
 people
 will
 pay
 for


instant
 quote
 unquote
 delivery.
 This
 has


always
 been
 true
 in
 financial
 services.


By
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 the
 magic
 behind


PayPal's
 revenue
 model.
 We
 basically


created
 an
 instant
 debit,
 effectively
 an


instant
 debit
 or
 a
 product
 back
 before


people
 knew
 those
 that
 language
 and
 then


we
 just
 charge
 the
 fee
 for
 the
 instant


receipt
 of
 the
 availability
 of
 the


capital.
 It's
 like
 FedEx
 time
 FedEx


financial
 services,
 right?
 This
 is
 like,


you
 know,
 Frederick
 Smith
 proved
 this


with
 FedEx.
 It's
 like


>> UPS.
 You
 pay
 32
 cents
 versus
 $10


overnight.
 It's
 like
 some
 people
 need
 it


before
 TED
 AO
 some
 and
 like
 it
 turns
 out


that's
 true
 for
 like
 a
 large
 like


countably
 infinite
 number
 of
 things.
 So,


but
 I
 think
 just
 in
 general
 for
 like


fintech
 um
 there
 probably
 are
 going
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 service
 like
 the
 banks


I
 I
 love
 something
 that
 you
 tweeted.
 I


think
 it
 was
 your
 pin
 tweet
 for
 a
 long


time.
 It's
 like
 how
 to
 disrupt
 a
 market.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Like
 pick
 something
 with
 very
 low


NPS
 and
 like
 you
 don't
 get
 better
 by


delivering
 one
 particular
 service
 of


that.
 Right.
 It's
 like
 oh
 here's
 a


camera
 that
 attaches
 to
 your
 phone.
 No,


that
 that
 nobody
 wants
 that.
 you
 want


like
 the
 better
 fully
 integrated
 service


so
 you
 vertically
 integrate
 and
 this
 was


open
 door
 right
 you
 could
 just
 say


here's
 a
 better
 AVM
 automated
 valuation


model
 okay
 like
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to


get
 the
 whole
 value
 I
 mean
 like
 would


you
 rather
 be
 like
 at
 the
 at
 the
 the


heart
 of
 it
 is
 like
 would
 you
 rather
 be


Amazon
 which
 has
 a
 very
 low
 gross
 margin


on
 products
 that
 they
 actually
 you
 know


store
 and
 sell
 or
 would
 you
 rather
 be


eBay
 which
 has
 amazing
 high
 gross


margins
 but
 is
 the
 shittiest
 service
 in


the
 world
 nobody
 wants
 to
 buy
 from
 eBay


because
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 you're
 going


to
 get
 the
 product
 on
 cloud
 you
 don't


know
 if
 Eric
 Torber
 is
 going
 to
 ship
 it


to
 me
 like
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 from
 Amazon


and
 Amazon
 is
 worth
 $2
 trillion
 and
 eBay


is
 worth
 like
 $40
 billion.
 So
 like


obviously
 Amazon
 is
 better
 but
 you
 would


misjudge
 that
 based
 on
 the
 gross
 margin


classification
 like
 oh
 VC
 is
 only
 like


doing
 high
 margin
 things
 and
 like
 I
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 I


really
 respect
 about
 you.
 It's
 like
 do


something
 really
 hard.
 It
 doesn't
 matter


what
 the
 gross
 margin
 profile
 is.
 It
 it


matters
 like
 how
 much
 gross
 profit
 are


you
 generating.


>> This
 is
 the
 worst
 thing.
 There's
 lots
 of


bad
 things
 you
 learn
 as
 a
 NBA
 like
 it's


like
 in
 list.
 This
 is
 the
 worst
 one
 is


like
 the
 gross
 margin
 especially


percentage.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 a


Amazon
 is
 successful.
 Stripe
 actually


back
 in
 the
 day
 took
 this
 model
 and
 back


before
 more
 people
 understood
 this
 and


said
 we
 only
 care
 about
 the
 sliver
 of


contribution
 dollars
 not
 like
 the


percentages.
 And
 everybody
 else
 was
 like


oh
 you
 got
 to
 worry
 about
 this
 margin
 or


that
 margin
 percentage.
 It's
 just
 like


are
 we
 adding
 incremental
 layers
 of


dollars
 actual
 cash?
 And
 that
 actually


works
 really
 well.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 VCs
 have


soured
 on
 the
 or
 not
 been
 not
 as
 excited


about
 the
 category
 in
 the
 in


>> perfect
 just
 send
 them
 all
 to
 us.


>> Keep
 being
 soured.
 Financial
 service


terrible
 innovation.


>> It's
 a
 very
 small
 market.
 Nobody
 cares.


>> Nobody
 likes
 it.


>> Well,
 this
 is
 the
 point
 that
 I
 was


getting
 to.
 It's
 like
 how
 many
 people


like
 their
 bank
 and
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 these


the
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 actually


work
 because
 of
 regulatory
 capture.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Like
 if
 it
 was
 very
 easy
 for


Keith
 and
 I
 to
 start
 a
 bank
 tomorrow.


Yes.
 Distribution
 is
 very
 hard,
 right?


And
 underwriting
 is
 very
 hard.
 I'm


pretty
 confident
 um
 at least
 in
 your


ability
 and
 to
 a
 lesser
 extent
 mine
 like


we
 would
 be
 able
 to
 get
 we
 could
 build
 a


very
 valuable
 company
 but
 it's
 so
 hard


like
 the
 regulatory
 overlay
 on
 these


things
 is
 so
 high
 and
 that's
 part
 of


what
 makes
 it
 challenging
 because
 nobody


likes
 Chase.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 there
 there's
 a
 saying
 that


I
 love
 which
 you've
 heard
 me
 use
 a
 lot


which
 is
 the
 best
 companies
 have


hostages
 not
 customers
 and
 like
 all
 the


financial
 services
 comp
 all
 the
 the


incumbent
 financial
 services
 companies


they
 have
 hostages
 they
 don't
 have


customers
 and
 it
 just
 it
 turns
 out
 it's


very
 even
 if
 you
 build
 a
 better
 product


a
 10
 times
 better
 product
 it's
 still


like
 the
 distribution
 is
 very
 very


challenging
 but
 this
 is
 what
 the
 killer


entrepreneurs
 can
 do
 it's
 like
 you
 find


and
 this
 is
 why
 like
 you
 know
 new
 bank


did
 this
 for
 Brazil
 like
 in
 many
 cases


it's
 geo
 by
 geo
 just
 because
 the


regulatory
 overlay
 is
 so
 high
 versus
 you


build
 a
 software
 for
 a
 product
 like


Microsoft
 Excel
 is
 Microsoft
 Excel
 for


the
 world.
 There's
 no
 like
 Portuguese


version
 of
 Microsoft
 Excel
 that
 only
 is


sold
 in
 Brazil
 and
 Portugal.


>> This
 is
 a
 it's
 a
 great
 opportunity.
 It's


one
 of
 the
 best
 investments
 I've
 ever


made
 is
 a
 company
 in
 Europe
 uh
 called


Trade
 Republic.
 It's
 actually
 better


than
 New
 Bank
 on
 any
 metric
 actually.
 Um


and
 but
 it
 could
 only
 be
 done
 in
 Europe.


It
 it
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 translate
 what


they
 do
 and
 why
 it's
 successful
 here.


There's
 Robin
 Hood's
 a
 poor
 comparison


here,
 but
 like
 is
 the
 closest,
 but
 so


you
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 arbitrage
 the
 geo


too
 um
 because
 and
 it's
 because
 of
 the


law
 and
 regulation.
 There's
 things
 that


are
 easier
 actually
 to
 do
 in
 Europe.


There's
 a
 reason
 why
 Trade
 Republic's


better
 than
 Robin
 Hood
 because
 in
 Europe


actually
 it's
 more
 permissive
 certain


things
 and
 then
 there's
 things
 that
 are


much
 easier
 to
 do
 here.
 And
 so
 you
 need


someone
 who
 understands
 like
 how
 to
 do


the
 pro
 how
 to
 create
 a
 product
 and


value
 prop
 given
 the
 constraints
 and


where
 are
 their
 gray
 zones
 and
 like
 how


does
 it
 translate
 to
 customer
 value
 and


so
 that's
 very
 difficult
 but
 there's
 a


lot
 there's
 a
 modern
 generation
 of


financial
 service
 innovation
 it's
 a


little
 under
 the
 radar
 I
 mean
 people


definitely
 are
 paying
 attention
 to
 ramp


y


>> so
 you
 know
 like
 high-profile
 company


but
 even
 a
 company
 in
 our
 portfolio
 that


I've
 invested
 in
 many
 times
 called
 a


most
 people
 still
 don't
 really
 know


about


>> it's
 a
 great
 company


>> another
 company
 is
 called
 imprint
 great


still
 fairly
 under
 the
 radar,
 competes


with
 two
 public
 companies.
 Um,
 actually


we
 sort
 of
 helped
 seed
 fund
 it
 back
 in
 a


firm
 um
 back
 when
 they
 were
 starting
 the


company.
 A
 firm
 did
 a
 corporate,
 you


know,
 sort
 of
 investment.


>> Cool.


>> Well,
 and
 that's
 the
 thing.
 It's
 like,


you
 know,
 software
 like
 I'm
 very


confident
 that
 all
 of
 the
 banks
 cannot


build
 software,
 will
 not
 be
 able
 to


build
 software,
 will
 not
 build
 software.


>> We're
 going to
 use
 Devon.
 So,
 that's


their
 best
 shot.


>> That's
 their
 best
 shot.
 But
 they
 can't


really
 like
 if
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 that


software
 is
 at
 the
 core
 of
 everything.


software
 is
 going
 to
 eat
 the
 world.
 Like


why
 hasn't
 it
 eaten
 financial
 services?


It
 has
 around
 the
 margin.
 It's
 like
 the


cool
 thing
 for
 ramp
 is
 like
 it's
 like
 a


net
 new
 market
 where
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 like


there
 was
 a
 shitty
 version
 of
 some


corporate
 card
 something
 something
 but


it's
 like
 that
 wasn't
 the
 software
 that


was
 a
 financial
 product.


>> Once
 you
 marry
 it
 to
 a
 software
 product


it's
 10
 times
 better.
 Like
 you
 have


vertically
 integrated
 that


>> and
 the
 incumbents
 can't
 do
 this.
 They


they're
 still
 like
 literally
 in
 cobalt


often
 and
 their
 ability
 to
 attract


talent
 is
 just
 like
 zero.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 why
 Devon
 is
 actually


arguably
 over
 time
 a
 save
 for
 them


because
 they
 won't
 need
 to
 attract


talent.
 They
 can
 use
 software
 to
 compete


with
 software


>> and
 the
 software
 can
 write
 cobalt.


>> Yep.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.


>> We'll
 take
 the
 conversation
 full
 circle.


We
 were
 talking
 about
 real
 estate.
 Uh
 a


real
 estate
 expert
 solved
 the
 Middle


East.
 What
 does
 it
 say
 about
 the
 nature


of
 expertise
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 a
 guy


who
 was
 a
 tycoon
 in
 real
 estate
 and


private
 equity
 but
 didn't
 have
 a
 ton
 of


you
 know
 foreign
 policy
 expertise.
 you


know
 initially
 or
 a
 trained
 background


in
 it
 could
 be
 more
 effective
 than
 you


know
 trained
 experts.


>> Well
 at
 KV
 you
 know
 from
 Venode
 on
 down


we
 don't
 believe
 in
 experts.
 You
 know


Vid
 has
 a
 whole
 speech
 about
 how
 no


expert
 has
 ever
 created
 fundamental


disruption
 in
 any
 field.
 You
 could
 argue


that
 maybe
 in
 the
 last
 90
 years
 there's


one
 or
 two
 exceptions
 but
 the
 fact
 that


you
 have
 to
 argue
 about
 the
 one
 or
 two


exceptions
 suggests
 he's
 right.
 So
 like


for
 example
 I
 don't
 like
 experts
 like


hiring
 domain
 experts
 in
 the
 companies
 I


work
 with
 is
 pretty
 much
 a
 non-starter.


At
 PayPal,
 we
 had
 of
 the
 254
 employees


we
 had
 in
 Mountain
 View
 uh
 when
 we
 went


public,


two
 maybe
 three
 had
 any
 expertise
 in


financial
 services.
 At
 Square,
 if
 you


included
 me,
 which
 is
 I'm
 certainly
 not


a
 prototypical
 financial
 services
 guy.


Of
 the
 first
 300
 employees,
 maybe
 two


had
 any
 financial
 services
 experience.


So,
 it's
 a
 pretty
 common
 formulation.


Airbnb,
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 Brian,
 Nate,
 and


Joe
 did
 not
 have
 any
 hospitality


experience.
 So
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 going


to
 reinvent
 industry,
 you
 don't
 want


experts.
 So
 the
 same
 thing
 is
 true
 in


politics.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 solve
 a
 problem


that's
 been
 intractable,


>> at
 least
 since
 World
 War
 II,
 arguably


for
 hundreds
 of
 years,
 but
 at least
 the


modern
 era
 been
 intractable,
 you


probably
 don't
 want
 anybody
 who's
 got


expertise
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 You
 know,


as
 Jared,
 you
 know,
 was
 maligned
 for,
 he


just
 read
 books,
 which
 is
 a
 great
 idea.


Actually,
 I
 talk
 about
 this
 all
 the


time.
 Like
 people
 are
 like,
 where
 do
 you


get
 your
 contrarian
 ideas?
 I
 was
 like,
 I


read
 books.
 Like
 there's
 actually
 all


the
 greatest
 thinking
 of
 all
 time
 is


available
 to
 anybody.


>> You
 just
 have
 to
 read.
 Um
 and
 the
 more


you
 read,
 the
 sharper
 you
 are
 because


what
 it
 what
 Jared
 talks
 about
 and
 I


think
 is
 the
 common
 formulation
 and
 we


definitely
 apply
 this
 at
 KV
 specifically


and
 explicitly
 is
 asking
 the
 right


questions.
 Yeah.
 So
 what
 books
 prepare


you
 to
 do
 is
 to
 ask
 questions.
 So
 when


Jared
 went
 to
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 got


dispatched
 the
 first
 time,
 he
 actually


asked
 the
 people
 who
 were
 influential


and
 important
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 like


what
 do
 you
 care
 about
 and
 why?
 Once
 you


understand
 that,
 you
 can
 navigate
 and


find
 solutions.
 And
 that's
 the
 same


thing
 we
 teach
 all
 of
 our
 investments
 at


KV
 is
 if
 you
 ask
 the
 right
 questions,


you'll
 make
 the
 right
 investment


decisions.
 So
 when
 people
 join
 the
 team


at
 KV,
 we
 don't
 actually
 look
 at
 their


output
 like
 are
 the
 companies
 great.
 We


look
 at
 the
 quality
 of
 their
 questions.


Venode
 is
 adamant
 about
 this,
 been


adamant
 about
 this
 for
 like
 40
 years.


Yeah.


>> Just
 the
 quality
 of
 questions
 tells
 you


everything
 you
 need
 to
 know.


>> That's
 a
 good
 place
 to
 wrap.
 You
 can


just
 do
 things.
 You
 can
 just
 read
 books.


Uh
 Keith,
 thanks
 so
 I'll
 give
 you
 book


recommendations
 next
 time.


>> Amazing.
 Perfect.
 Love


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
