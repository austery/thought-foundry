You're
 listening
 to
 Mistreated.
 I'm
 Nam


Kiwanuka.
 You
 might
 have
 heard
 of
 PCOS.


It's
 an
 acronym
 that
 stands
 for


polycystic
 ovarian
 syndrome,
 a
 condition


that
 affects
 1.4
 million
 Canadians.
 And


globally,
 it
 impacts
 one
 in
 eight
 women.


For
 a
 condition
 that
 was
 identified
 just


over
 90
 years
 ago,
 there's
 no
 one


medication
 to
 treat
 it.
 The
 exact
 cause


of
 it
 is
 unknown.
 It's
 not
 curable,
 and


it
 is
 poorly
 understood.
 Some
 experts


say
 PCOS
 looks
 to
 be
 at least
 two
 or


three
 different
 conditions
 that
 have


been
 lumped
 together
 and
 there
 are
 calls


for
 it
 to
 be
 separated
 into
 two


different
 diagnoses.
 Others
 say
 the
 name


polycystic
 ovarian
 syndrome
 is


misleading
 and
 that
 the
 name
 should
 be


changed.
 According
 to
 reporting
 from
 the


conversation,
 an
 independent
 online


publication
 from
 the
 academic
 and


research
 community,
 women
 with
 PCOS
 are


20
 to
 40%
 more
 likely
 to
 experience


negative
 health
 outcomes
 during
 their


lifetime
 than
 the
 general
 population.


This
 includes
 risks
 of
 developing


hypertension,
 kidney
 disease,
 eating


disorders,
 depression,
 anxiety,
 and


gastrointestinal
 disease.
 It's
 also
 been


associated
 with
 infertility
 and


miscarriage,
 and
 it's
 common
 for
 women


with
 it
 to
 experience
 pelvic
 and


abdominal
 pain.
 Women
 with
 PCOS
 are
 also


two
 to
 three
 times
 more
 likely
 to
 have


type
 2
 diabetes.
 And
 when
 PCOS
 symptoms


are
 missed
 or
 misdiagnosed,
 it
 also
 puts


women
 at
 higher
 risk
 of
 heart
 failure


and
 stroke.
 And
 every
 person
 has
 a


unique
 presentation.
 And
 that
 might
 be


part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 70%
 of
 women
 who


have
 it
 remain
 undiagnosed.
 And
 our


guest
 today
 describes
 it
 like
 a


fingerprint
 where
 every
 person's


condition
 and
 every
 person's
 needs
 are
 a


little
 different.
 Andrea
 Lewis
 is
 an


actor
 and
 producer.
 You
 might
 recognize


her
 from
 her
 role
 as
 Hazel
 on
 Degrassi


the
 Next
 Generation.
 She
 was
 diagnosed


with
 PCOS
 in
 2012.
 She's
 been
 open
 about


talking
 about
 her
 diagnosis
 and
 what


it's
 like
 to
 live
 with
 it.
 And
 she's


been
 an
 advocate
 for
 those
 with
 it.
 She


joins
 me
 now.


>> Hi,
 Andrea
 Lewis.
 Welcome
 to
 the


podcast.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> I'm
 so
 excited
 to
 be
 able
 to
 speak
 to


you.
 Um
 because
 I'm
 a
 fan
 of
 the
 work


that
 you're
 doing,
 especially
 with
 like


glam
 culture
 right
 now.
 So,


congratulations
 on
 that.
 Um,
 I
 w
 also


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 PCOS
 because


this
 is
 something
 that
 you've
 been


talking
 about
 for
 a
 while.
 Andrea,
 can


you
 give
 us
 a
 definition
 of
 what
 it
 is?


>> Polycystic
 ovarian
 syndrome
 is
 is
 what


it
 breaks
 down
 into.
 Um,
 but
 PCOS
 is
 a


metabolic
 disorder
 and
 a
 hormonal


disorder.
 It
 affects
 about
 I'd
 say
 maybe


one
 in
 10
 women
 across
 North
 America
 and


in
 the
 UK.
 It
 is
 something
 that


essentially
 affects
 your
 reproductive


health.
 So,
 there's
 a
 very
 there's
 a


various
 amount
 of
 ways
 that
 you
 can
 kind


of
 be
 affected
 by
 PCOS,
 but
 typically
 it


is
 by
 having
 little
 cysts
 on
 um
 your


ovaries.
 It
 usually
 causes
 you
 to
 have


irregular
 periods,
 but
 this
 can
 also


affect
 weight
 gain.
 This
 can
 affect
 um


your
 testosterone
 levels.
 This
 affects


um
 hair
 growth
 in
 many
 different
 ways


for
 women.
 But
 again,
 these
 are
 kind
 of


variants
 of
 it.
 So,
 every
 woman
 I
 know


has
 it
 in
 a
 very
 different
 way.
 they


they
 it
 it
 honestly
 behaves
 a
 lot
 like
 a


fingerprint.
 It's
 also
 kind
 of the


leading
 cause
 of
 um
 infertility
 in
 a
 lot


of
 women
 in
 and
 and
 women
 are
 often


diagnosed
 kind
 of
 later
 on
 when
 they


realize
 they're
 going
 they're
 trying
 for


a
 child
 and
 they're
 having
 a
 really
 hard


time
 with
 it
 and
 then
 they
 discovered


like
 oh
 they
 actually
 have
 PCOS.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 how
 you
 discovered


that
 you
 had
 PCOS.
 How
 were
 you
 feeling


when
 you
 went
 to
 the
 doctor
 because
 this


is
 way
 back
 I
 think
 in
 2012.
 Yeah,
 2012


is
 when
 I
 2012
 is
 when
 I
 got
 diagnosed,


but
 I'd
 say
 I
 probably
 had
 it
 before


that
 because
 um
 I
 I
 always
 recall
 I
 had


like
 a
 year
 where
 I
 I
 don't
 even


remember
 my
 period
 actually
 coming.
 Um


but
 I
 was
 younger
 and
 and
 you
 know,


period
 health
 is
 um
 when
 when
 I
 was


growing
 up
 at
 least,
 it
 was
 not
 treated


as
 something
 that
 we
 should
 care
 about.


It
 was
 treated
 more
 like
 taboo.
 It
 was


like
 you
 didn't
 really
 talk
 about
 it.


And
 so
 when
 I
 was
 truly
 diagnosed
 with


PCOS,
 it
 was
 because
 I
 was
 in
 a


relationship
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 I
 remember


I
 just
 wasn't
 getting
 my
 period.
 And


obviously
 I
 was
 sexually
 active
 because


I
 was
 in
 a
 relationship.
 I
 knew
 I
 was


not
 pregnant,
 but
 I
 just
 was
 not
 getting


my
 period.
 It
 just
 was
 not
 coming.
 And


at
 the
 time
 I
 was
 struggling
 with
 my


weight.
 I
 was
 struggling
 with
 my
 overall


mental
 health
 and
 and
 just
 kind
 of


thinking
 it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 factors.


I
 went
 to
 my
 doctor.
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 not


getting
 my
 period."
 And
 I
 remember
 at


the
 time
 he
 literally
 gave
 me
 birth


control
 and
 he
 was
 like
 when
 you
 do
 get


it
 just
 take
 this
 and
 it
 will
 just
 make


it
 regular.
 And
 I
 remember
 feeling
 like


but
 I'm
 not
 getting
 it.
 So
 like
 will
 I


ever
 get
 to
 take
 this
 birth
 control?
 And


I
 honestly
 did
 not
 at
 the
 time
 because


my
 period
 did
 not
 end
 up
 coming.
 And
 I


remember
 going
 back
 to
 him
 and
 that's


when
 he
 eventually
 set
 me
 up
 with
 some


appointments
 with
 some
 specialists.
 And


I
 went
 to
 maybe
 two
 or
 three
 different


specialists
 and
 they
 all
 had
 very


different
 um
 I
 guess
 bedside
 manner
 is


what
 I'll
 call
 it
 like
 in
 degrees
 of


care
 because
 I
 remember
 going
 to
 one
 who


was
 just
 basically
 like
 you
 have
 to
 lose


weight
 and
 um
 and
 then
 it
 will
 just
 kind


of
 come
 and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 okay
 and
 and


it
 was
 like
 always
 everybody
 was
 like


you'll
 struggle
 to
 um
 conceive
 and
 then


I
 went
 to
 another
 that
 was
 like
 oh
 don't


worry
 about
 it
 you're
 young
 it'll
 figure


itself
 out
 And
 then
 finally
 at
 the
 time


I
 found
 a
 nutritionist
 who
 also


specialized
 in
 PCOS
 and
 she
 was
 probably


the
 first
 person
 who
 really
 made
 me
 feel


like
 oh
 I
 can
 manage
 this
 thing.
 I
 can


figure
 this
 thing
 out.
 But
 I
 I
 felt
 all


the
 emotions.
 I
 felt
 a
 bit
 embarrassed.


I
 felt
 a
 lot
 of
 shame.
 I
 I
 felt
 confused


with
 it.
 I
 was
 really
 challenged
 by
 what


you
 were
 supposed
 to
 eat
 or
 not
 eat.
 By


the
 way
 you
 were
 supposed
 to
 exercise
 or


not
 exercise.
 Because
 again,
 the


emphasis
 is
 on
 lose
 weight,
 which
 it's
 a


hormonal
 disorder.
 So
 if
 your
 hormonal


if
 your
 hormones
 are
 out
 of
 whack,


weight
 challenges
 are
 like
 that's
 all


you're
 experiencing.
 You're
 gaining


weight,
 you're
 losing
 weight,
 you're
 not


moving
 with
 your
 weight.
 That's
 the


that's
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 have
 a


hormonal
 challenge.
 And
 so
 anybody


whether
 you
 have
 PCOS
 or
 not,
 whenever
 I


meet
 somebody
 and
 they
 tell
 me
 like,


"Oh,
 their
 their
 hormones
 are
 the


issue."
 I'm
 always
 like
 I
 I
 completely


can
 empathize
 with
 where
 they
 are
 at


because
 it
 affects
 so
 many
 parts
 of
 our


lives
 and
 feeling
 very
 out
 of
 control
 in


your
 body
 is
 a
 big
 thing
 with
 PCOS.
 So


oftentimes
 when
 they
 emphasize
 like
 lose


weight,
 the
 women
 tend
 to
 go
 really
 hard


on
 on
 weight
 loss,
 like
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 I


have
 to
 do
 highintensity
 workouts.
 I
 I


have
 to
 be
 not
 eating
 anything.
 And
 that


actually
 affects
 you
 even
 more.
 That
 is


too
 stressful.
 So,
 in
 truth,
 why
 PCS
 is


so
 challenging
 is
 because
 it's
 it's


something
 that
 requires
 really
 low


stress.
 Like,


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 more
 about
 that,
 but
 I


want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 something
 that
 you


said.
 Um,
 why
 did
 you
 feel
 embarrassed


and
 ashamed
 when
 you
 found
 out
 that
 you


had
 PCOS?
 Um,
 I
 think
 because
 you're


you're
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 anything
 that


is
 uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 reproductive


health
 that
 sounds
 different
 to
 other


people,
 like
 that
 sounds
 different
 to


your
 friends.
 It's
 like,
 yeah,
 like
 I


said,
 when
 I
 was
 growing
 up,
 your
 period


was
 taught
 in
 like
 the
 most
 basic
 way.


It
 was
 like,
 okay,
 now
 that
 you
 have


your
 period,
 you
 can
 get
 pregnant
 at
 any


at
 any
 given
 moment,
 and
 you're
 going
 to


have
 PMS
 and
 just
 like
 a
 bad
 attitude
 or


something
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 to
 kind
 of


deal
 with
 something
 that
 your
 period
 is


not
 coming
 on
 a
 regular
 basis
 even


though
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 function
 like


every
 other
 woman
 around
 you
 or
 that


maybe
 you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 a
 challenge


to
 have
 a
 child
 things
 like
 that.
 And


then
 on
 top
 of
 that
 like
 that
 your
 body


is
 not
 feeling
 like
 it's
 your
 own.


You're
 you're
 gaining
 this
 weight.


You're
 feeling
 really
 sad
 all
 the
 time


or
 really
 depressed
 or
 really
 anxious.


and
 to
 know
 that
 it
 has
 to
 deal
 do
 with


this
 thing
 that
 almost
 sounds
 made
 up
 to


people.
 I
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 who
 had
 PCOS


and
 she
 was
 had
 really
 challenges
 with


her
 weight
 and
 I
 remember
 um
 talking
 to


her
 mom
 about
 it
 and
 saying
 that
 I
 too


had
 the
 same
 thing
 as
 her
 and
 her
 mom


literally
 said,
 "Oh,
 I
 didn't
 actually


think
 it
 was
 real.
 I
 actually
 just


thought
 my
 daughter
 was
 eating
 too
 much


candy.
 That's
 why
 she
 kept
 gaining


weight."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 no.
 It's


it's
 it's
 very
 real."
 And
 and
 so
 I
 think


I'm
 the
 first
 woman
 in
 my
 generation
 of


my
 family
 to
 experience
 it.
 So
 it's
 like


my
 mom
 didn't
 have
 it.
 My
 cousins
 that


are
 older
 than
 me
 didn't
 have
 it.
 My


grandmother
 didn't
 have
 it.
 And
 maybe


they
 do
 have
 a
 uh
 degrees
 of
 it,
 but
 I'm


the
 first
 one
 to
 like
 be
 diagnosed
 and


like
 have
 it.
 So
 you
 feel
 very
 alone
 in


the
 process,
 which
 can
 feel
 uh
 shameful


that
 you're
 just
 not
 your
 body
 is
 not


functioning
 the
 way
 people
 tell
 you


women
 are
 supposed
 to
 function.
 That


like
 you're
 that
 you
 should
 be
 just


working
 out
 and
 not
 eating
 whatever


you're
 eating.
 that's
 causing
 you
 to


have
 this
 problem.
 And
 often
 times
 it's


not
 that.
 It's
 like
 it's
 so
 many
 more


things.
 It's
 so
 complex
 and
 um
 and


people
 are
 not
 necessarily


uh
 empathetic
 to
 it.
 And
 and
 so
 yeah,
 at


first
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 had
 it
 and
 and


like
 I
 said,
 I
 was
 in
 a
 relationship,
 I


used
 to
 feel
 like
 the
 symptoms
 sounded


fake.
 It
 was
 like,
 well,
 she
 could
 be


really
 sad
 because
 she
 has
 PCOS.
 Oh,


well,
 she's
 just
 not
 losing
 any
 weight


because
 she
 has
 PCOS.
 Or
 she
 shouldn't


eat
 that
 chocolate
 because
 she
 has
 PCOS.


It's
 just
 like
 it
 just
 didn't
 sound
 like


something
 that
 people
 could
 really
 get


behind,
 especially
 because,
 you
 know,
 it


doesn't
 have
 like
 the
 you
 don't
 wear
 the


physical
 issue
 on
 it,
 right?
 It's


something
 that's
 so
 inside.
 I
 remember


having
 a
 doctor's
 appointment
 um
 and


going
 in
 and
 telling
 the
 nurse
 that
 I


had
 PCOS
 and
 she
 was like,
 "You
 don't


look
 like
 somebody
 that
 has
 PCOS.
 You


don't
 look
 like
 that
 at
 all."
 And
 I
 was


like, "Oh,
 well,
 what
 does
 it
 like
 look


like?"
 And
 and
 often
 times,
 like
 I
 said,


they
 kind
 of
 stereotype
 it.
 They
 think,


"Oh,
 well,
 you're
 supposed
 to
 be
 obese


or
 you're
 supposed
 to
 be
 larger.
 You're


supposed
 to
 be
 something
 like
 that."
 And


then
 women
 who
 really
 do
 have
 like
 a


larger
 body
 mass,
 they
 are
 now
 not


empathetic
 with
 those
 women.
 They're


like,
 "Oh,
 well,
 no,
 it
 can't
 be
 PCOS


that's
 got
 you
 this
 size.
 It
 has
 to
 be


something
 else."
 And
 so,
 it's
 very
 it
 it


has
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 find
 that
 people


outside
 of
 the
 PCOS
 community


necessarily
 understand
 what
 it
 is
 that


you're
 dealing
 with.
 And
 it's
 only
 kind


of
 very
 recently.
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 who


recently
 had
 a
 conversation
 with
 me


about
 PCOS
 saying
 that
 his
 wife
 was


recently
 diagnosed
 and
 so
 he
 was
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 research
 and
 learning
 about
 it.


But
 like,
 yeah,
 we're
 in
 2025.
 When
 I


was
 diagnosed,
 it
 was
 2012.
 And
 no,
 I


did
 not
 experience
 people
 being
 that


empathetic
 to
 it.
 I
 I'm
 still
 like


trying
 to
 process
 someone
 like
 something


being
 called
 something
 as
 serious
 as


PCOS
 being
 called
 the
 lazy
 girl
 disease


because


>> um


>> if
 you
 have
 PCOS
 you're
 at
 risk
 of


developing
 hypertension
 kidney
 disease


uh
 eating
 disorders,
 depression,


anxiety,
 gastrointestinal
 disease
 um


along
 with
 what
 you
 were
 talking
 about


infertility,
 uh
 miscarriage
 also
 women


with
 PCOS
 are
 also
 two
 to
 three
 times


more
 likely
 to
 have
 type
 do
 diabetes
 um


experience
 heart
 failure
 and
 stroke.


This
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 whether
 or


not
 you
 can
 jog
 5
 miles
 in
 the
 morning


or
 not
 or
 you're
 going
 to
 sit
 on
 the


couch
 and
 eat
 a
 bag
 of
 chips.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 absolutely
 right.
 And
 that's


what's
 unfortunate
 because
 I
 think
 as


well
 if
 people
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 more


time
 to
 understand
 even
 their
 own
 family


history.
 So
 within
 my
 family
 both
 on
 my


mom
 and
 my
 dad's
 side
 is
 diabetes.
 And


so
 when
 I
 eventually
 kind
 of
 understood


that,
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 well,
 my
 PCOS
 is


is
 a
 direct
 result
 of
 the
 diabetes


that's
 in
 my
 family."
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 like


that
 has
 absolutely
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


if
 I
 can
 run,
 if
 I
 can't
 run,
 all
 of


those
 types
 of
 things.
 I
 had
 a


conversation
 with
 somebody
 last
 year


telling
 me
 that
 they
 trained
 for
 the
 New


York
 Marathon
 and
 they
 have
 PCOS.
 They


were
 like,
 I
 I
 probably
 lost
 one
 pound


in
 my
 training
 for
 a
 marathon.
 your


average
 I
 get
 I
 guess
 your
 your
 average


person
 whose
 body
 let's
 say
 functions


completely
 normally
 would
 not
 experience


that.
 They
 would
 experience
 more
 weight


loss.
 They
 would
 experience
 their
 body,


you
 know,
 going
 through
 more
 changes.


But
 a
 PCOS
 woman
 could
 truly
 be
 doing


all
 the
 things
 right
 and
 still
 not
 see


any
 real
 change
 to
 their
 body.
 So
 oftent


times
 um
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 process
 it


as
 like
 well
 I'm
 doing
 these
 things
 for


my
 mental
 health.
 I'm
 doing
 these
 things


because
 it
 brings
 me
 joy.
 I'm
 doing


these
 things
 because
 it
 just
 feels
 good


to
 me
 versus
 worrying
 about
 how
 your


body
 will
 change
 or
 not
 change.
 Um


because
 if
 you're
 comparing
 yourself
 to


say
 your
 friends
 or
 the
 people
 around


you,
 you'll
 just
 find
 yourself
 very


frustrated
 and
 and
 I'm
 finally
 in
 that


kind
 of
 place
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 my
 own


PCOS.
 I
 I
 understand
 how
 to
 manage
 it


for
 me
 and
 how
 to
 give
 my
 body
 grace.


But
 um
 as
 you
 said,
 it's
 like
 yes,
 the


amount
 of
 oh,
 you'll
 be
 fine.
 Oh
 yeah,


just
 lose
 some
 weight.
 Oh,
 no.
 When
 it


comes
 time
 for
 it
 for
 you,
 like
 when
 you


want
 to
 have
 children,
 it
 will
 be
 easy.


I
 can't
 even
 begin
 to
 tell
 you
 how
 many


times
 I've
 had
 those
 kind
 of


conversations
 and
 they
 make
 me
 sad.
 They


make
 me
 very
 frustrated.
 But
 I
 just


realized
 I'm
 like
 it
 is
 hard
 for
 people


on
 the
 outside
 looking
 in
 to
 understand


the
 importance
 of
 reproductive
 health


and
 the
 and
 the
 ways
 that
 that
 people


who
 um
 experience
 these
 things
 PCOS,


endometriosis,
 fibroids,
 anything
 like


that,
 the
 way
 that
 we
 are
 navigating


through
 the
 world,
 it's
 it's
 not
 um


yeah,
 it's
 not
 so
 easy
 as
 people
 would


like
 to
 think.
 Um,
 the
 WHO
 uh
 says
 that


uh
 up
 to
 70%
 of
 women
 with
 PCOS
 don't


even
 know
 that
 they
 have
 PCOS.
 U
 I
 want


to
 go
 back
 to
 when
 you
 first
 were


talking
 to
 your
 doctor
 and
 you
 said
 you


probably
 had
 it
 before
 2012.
 Um
 when
 I


had
 fibroids
 and
 u
 my
 friends
 with


endometriosis
 when
 I
 speak
 to
 them
 we


are
 the
 opposite.
 We
 bleed
 a
 lot
 and
 um


the
 doctors


>> the
 common
 thing
 is
 like
 oh
 it's
 just
 a


period
 um
 you
 know
 just
 take
 some


Tylenol
 and
 you
 know
 buy
 some
 extra
 pads


it's
 just
 a
 period.
 Um
 but
 you
 were


experiencing
 the
 opposite
 and
 when
 you


don't
 have
 uh
 if
 your
 period
 isn't


coming
 you're
 at
 a
 higher
 risk
 of


developing
 uterine
 cancer.


>> So
 when
 you
 went
 to
 your
 doctor
 and
 you


you
 said
 I'm
 not
 having
 my
 period
 and


they
 were
 like
 well
 just
 take
 like
 take


me
 back
 to
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Take
 take
 me
 back
 to
 that
 because


it's
 like
 the
 doctor
 themselves
 uh
 don't


seem
 to
 understand
 the
 severity
 of
 PCOS


and
 did
 you
 ever
 have
 conversations
 with


doctors
 who
 were
 just
 like
 well
 at least


you're
 not
 getting
 your
 period
 like
 you


should
 be
 happy
 you're
 not
 getting
 your


period.
 Well,
 basically
 they
 were
 h
 they


were
 like,
 "Well,
 at least
 you
 know


you're
 not
 pregnant."
 Like
 at
 least
 it's


like,
 you
 know,
 like
 you're
 not
 getting


your
 period,
 you
 know,
 you're
 not


pregnant.
 Like
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal
 kind
 of
 thing.
 Like
 I
 said,
 where
 I


don't
 think
 the
 doctor
 was
 processing


what
 I
 was
 saying
 that
 I'm
 like
 I
 was
 at


this
 point
 maybe
 8
 months
 in
 of
 not


getting
 my
 period.
 I'm
 in
 a
 relationship


with
 somebody.
 I
 am
 I
 have
 tested
 I
 am


not
 pregnant
 and
 I'm
 not
 getting
 my


period.
 And
 he's
 like,
 "It's
 okay.
 When


you
 get
 it,
 just
 take
 this
 birth
 control


and
 it
 will
 make
 it
 regular."
 And
 it's


like,
 "But
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 getting
 it."


And
 so
 some
 this
 needs
 to
 be
 taken
 a


little
 bit
 more
 serious.
 And
 just
 like


you
 said,
 I
 have
 met
 before
 women
 who


would
 tell
 me
 they
 weren't
 getting
 their


period
 on
 a
 regular
 basis
 or
 it
 was
 very


irregular
 or
 something
 and
 I'd
 say,
 "Oh,


you
 should
 probably
 get
 that
 looked
 at.


That
 sounds
 like
 PCOS."
 And
 they'd
 be


like, "Oh,
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 a
 deal.
 I


actually
 prefer
 it
 because
 it's
 like,


oh,
 well,
 I'm
 not
 getting
 cramps
 or
 I'm


not."
 And
 I
 am
 always
 in
 shock.
 But
 I


always
 go
 back
 to,
 like
 I
 said,
 when
 I


was
 growing
 up
 and
 I
 I
 can
 remember


being
 in
 grade
 seven
 or
 six.
 I
 can't


remember
 one
 of
 those
 grades,
 but
 like


the
 the
 period
 conversation
 that
 we
 had


at
 school
 and
 it
 was
 literally
 like
 a


bunch
 of
 young
 girls
 and
 they
 take
 us
 to


the
 side
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 tell
 us,
 "All


right,
 yeah,
 you
 can
 get
 pregnant
 now.


You
 might
 have
 P
 PMS
 and
 you
 should
 have


pass."
 Like
 it
 was
 like
 boom,
 boom,


boom.
 Just
 those
 things.


>> Check
 mark,
 check
 mark,
 check
 mark.


Yeah.
 And
 like,
 okay,
 done.
 Go
 off,


girls.


And
 I
 remember
 too,
 like
 because,
 you


know,
 at
 that
 time,
 it
 it
 it
 was
 almost


like
 a
 it
 has
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 badge
 of


honor
 of
 being
 like,
 oh,
 I'm
 growing
 up


as
 a
 little
 girl.
 You
 know,
 when
 you're


12,
 when
 you're
 11,
 you're
 13,
 when


you're
 those
 ages
 and
 you're
 kind
 of


getting
 your
 period.
 And
 I
 remember
 my


friends
 like,
 I
 got
 mine
 and
 I
 got
 mine


and
 a
 couple
 of
 us
 within
 the
 school


year.
 And
 then
 the
 ones
 that
 didn't
 now


in
 hindsight
 I'm
 like
 oh
 they
 must
 have


felt
 a
 lot
 of
 anxiety
 thinking
 you
 know


oh
 is
 mine
 coming
 or
 not
 coming.
 Um
 and


so
 yeah
 I
 find
 that
 the
 idea
 of
 what
 a


period
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 for
 women
 that


I
 read
 that
 it's
 like
 it's
 supposed
 to


be
 the
 report
 card.
 It
 is
 supposed
 to
 be


the
 thing
 that
 indicates
 like
 your
 body


is
 functioning
 the
 way
 it
 is
 supposed
 to


function
 and
 that
 it's
 not
 taken
 as


seriously
 as
 it
 should
 be.
 So
 I
 I
 have
 a


best
 friend
 that
 we
 used
 to
 live


together
 years
 ago
 and
 she
 has
 fibroids.


And
 I
 always
 used
 to
 say
 I
 was
 like,


"Yes,
 in
 this
 house,
 one
 of
 us
 has
 too


much
 period
 and
 the
 other
 has
 no
 period


because
 she
 experienced
 all
 the
 things


um
 with
 her
 fibroids."
 And
 I
 just
 and


and
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 can't
 even
 believe


that
 we
 we
 are
 also
 trying
 to
 find
 joy


knowing
 that
 our
 bodies
 were
 functioning


in
 this
 way
 that
 was
 really
 hard
 for
 us


and
 really
 challenging
 and
 we
 were
 both


every
 single
 day
 just
 trying
 to
 kind
 of


manage
 through
 it.
 But
 I'm
 like,
 she's


having
 to
 bring
 an
 extra
 pair
 of
 pants


with
 her
 somewhere
 because
 she
 may
 bleed


out
 of
 her
 pants.


>> I'm
 fighting
 for
 my
 life
 just
 to
 get


like
 a
 period
 to
 come
 on
 a
 regular


basis.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 people
 and


I
 always
 say
 I'm
 like,
 I
 wish
 that


somebody
 had
 told
 us
 when
 we
 were
 13


years
 old
 that
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 could
 possibly
 happen,
 that
 you


should
 be
 thinking
 about
 your
 body


overall
 and
 how
 it
 should
 be
 uh
 working


and
 that
 every
 little
 thing
 is
 something


that
 is
 important
 to
 talk
 about
 like
 and


I
 wish
 that
 a
 doctor
 took
 me
 more


seriously
 at
 the
 time,
 but
 I
 remember


feeling
 yeah,
 incredibly
 frustrated
 um


because
 it
 really
 depends


um
 on
 I
 guess
 even
 their
 own
 level.
 And


you
 know,
 not
 to
 kind
 of
 do
 this
 because


I
 I
 do
 know
 that
 there
 are
 men
 who
 take


this
 very
 seriously,
 but
 at
 the
 time
 all


the
 doctors
 that
 I
 dealt
 with
 for
 my


PCOS
 were
 all
 men.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 maybe


there
 was
 something
 with
 that
 and
 why


they
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 kind
 of
 dismissed


the
 issue
 versus
 seeing
 it
 as
 like,
 oh,


>> hey,
 this
 is
 something
 to
 call
 out.
 Mind


you,
 it's
 like
 I
 was
 much
 younger
 and


like
 I
 said
 where
 the
 idea


um
 of
 periods
 in
 my
 life,
 the
 way
 it
 was


taught
 was
 like,
 oh,
 if
 if
 a
 period's


not
 coming,
 you're
 pregnant.
 And
 because


I
 knew
 I
 wasn't
 pregnant,
 I
 didn't
 I
 was


just
 like,
 okay,
 well,
 I
 guess
 it
 will


show
 up
 when
 it
 shows
 up.
 And
 it's
 like


now
 I
 track
 my
 period
 very
 intensely,


but
 I
 always
 think
 when
 I
 was
 younger,


I'm
 like,
 did
 I
 even
 pay
 attention
 to


when
 it
 was
 coming,
 when
 it
 wasn't


coming,
 what
 was
 happening
 to
 me,
 what


wasn't
 happening
 to
 me?
 I
 have
 no
 idea


if
 I
 did
 those
 things.
 So,
 at
 the
 time,


I
 remember
 I
 had
 moved
 to
 a
 new
 city.
 I


was
 in
 my
 first
 serious
 relationship.


Um,
 I
 was
 figuring
 so
 many
 things
 out
 in


my
 life.
 So,
 also
 my
 period
 not
 showing


up
 was
 just
 like
 a
 long
 list
 of
 things


that
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 going
 through
 that


was
 stressful.
 So,
 it
 was
 one
 of
 those


things
 that
 it's
 it's
 very
 easy
 for
 you


to
 kind
 of
 put
 it
 to
 the
 okay,
 put
 that


to
 the
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 list
 like
 this


is
 this
 can
 be
 dealt
 with
 a
 little
 later


as
 long
 as
 I
 know
 I'm
 not
 pregnant


because
 of
 some
 you
 know.
 Okay,
 I'm


fine.
 Cool.


>> Did
 you
 ever
 did
 a
 doctor
 ever
 tell
 you


to
 um
 maybe
 have
 a
 try
 to
 have
 a
 baby


right
 away
 to
 because
 that's
 something


that's
 been
 suggested
 to
 people
 with


endometriosis
 in
 order
 to
 treat
 their


endometriosis.
 But
 that's
 not


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 like
 to
 have
 a
 baby
 immediate


like
 just
 to
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 get
 a
 baby


out
 of
 the
 way
 right
 now."


>> Try
 to
 have
 a
 baby
 because
 that
 would


stop
 the
 pain
 from
 the
 indomeiosis.


>> No
 way.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 No.
 I'm
 I'm
 like


PCOS
 women
 are
 I
 think
 treated
 like
 as


if
 we
 are
 just
 completely
 barren
 and
 not


able
 to
 have
 a
 baby
 at
 all.
 And
 um
 and
 I


think
 that's
 probably
 the
 most
 painful


part
 of
 PCOS.
 even
 even
 to
 this
 day
 as


somebody
 who
 speaks
 about
 PCOS
 very


frequently.
 Um
 I
 had
 somebody
 and
 I
 had


to
 really
 correct
 them
 because
 it
 really


hurt
 my
 feelings
 that
 they
 sent
 me
 a


bunch
 of
 information
 on
 um
 on
 women
 who


are
 infertile
 and
 miscarriages.
 And
 I


was
 kind
 of
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 isn't
 like


this
 isn't
 uh
 PCOS.
 This
 is
 actually


something
 else."
 And
 they're
 like, "Oh,


well,
 I
 just
 thought
 that
 you
 could


relate."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 well,
 not


all
 PCOS
 women
 are
 unable
 to
 have


babies."
 Like,
 it's
 just
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 more
 challenging
 for
 us
 and
 kind
 of


trying
 to
 explain
 that.
 But
 when
 I
 was


first
 diagnosed,
 no,
 it
 was
 spoken
 to
 me


like
 as
 if
 I
 was
 just
 unable
 to
 have
 a


child.


>> How
 did
 you
 why
 did
 you
 decide
 to
 speak


up
 again
 about
 PCOS?
 because
 you
 did
 it


at
 a
 time
 when
 very
 again
 the
 the
 stigma


is
 still
 around
 period
 pain
 now
 in
 2025


but
 when
 you
 started
 to
 talk
 about
 it


not
 very
 many
 people
 were
 talking
 about


anything
 that
 had
 to
 do
 like
 with


women's
 business


>> yeah
 you
 know
 what
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was


honestly
 just
 because
 I
 always
 felt
 like


I
 needed
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 grace
 like
 I


think
 as
 somebody
 who's
 like
 in
 a


front-facing
 business
 I'm
 an
 entertainer


I've
 been
 in
 entertainment
 since
 I
 was
 a


little
 kid
 like
 the
 pressures
 that
 are


put
 onto
 entertainers,
 onto
 actresses


specifically,
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 weight,


in
 terms
 of
 your
 um
 your
 joy,
 like
 just


like
 the
 the
 the
 the
 continuous
 like


pursuing
 of
 a
 really
 hard
 industry.
 Um
 I


always
 felt
 like
 one,
 this
 is
 very
 hard.


So,
 um,
 that
 was
 a
 challenge
 for
 me
 in


itself,
 but
 then
 to
 also
 add
 in
 there


that
 you
 had
 a
 reproductive
 challenge,


that
 you
 had
 something
 hormonally
 that


you
 were
 dealing
 with,
 a
 metabolic


challenge,
 it
 just
 felt
 like,
 oh,
 if
 I


could
 talk
 about
 anything
 kind
 of


casually,
 PCOS
 just
 naturally
 came
 up


because
 I
 felt
 like,
 oh,
 I
 I
 need
 to


explain
 why
 I
 need
 some
 grace.


if
 you
 see
 any
 changes
 or
 if
 you
 don't


or
 if
 you
 do
 is
 because
 I'm
 also


navigating
 this
 thing.
 And
 um
 and
 I


think
 also
 because
 I
 didn't
 really
 see


it
 the
 conversation
 that
 often
 and
 um


and
 I
 always
 think
 about
 it
 like
 that.


Like
 if
 that
 there's
 something
 that


you're
 looking
 up
 and
 you're
 not
 really


seeing
 a
 lot
 um
 it's
 probably
 it's


probably
 your
 turn
 to
 start
 to
 talk


about
 it.
 And
 I
 remember
 at
 the
 time
 I


used
 to
 find
 just
 kind
 of
 forums
 and
 the


forums
 were
 so
 sad.
 Like
 all
 of
 the


women
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 how


depressed
 they
 felt
 or
 their
 bodies
 or


they're
 trying
 to
 have
 a
 baby
 or
 they


were
 really
 shockingly
 like,
 "Oh
 my


gosh,
 like
 this
 is
 what
 the
 next
 10


years
 or
 20
 years
 or
 15
 years
 of
 my
 life


is
 going
 to
 look
 like."
 And
 um
 and
 so
 I


think
 when
 I
 started
 to
 talk
 about
 PCOS,


it
 just
 felt
 like
 a
 documenting
 of
 a


journey
 of
 trying
 to
 figure
 it
 out.
 And


I
 still
 always
 tell
 people
 that
 like
 I
 I


have
 a
 lot
 of
 tricks
 up
 my
 sleeve.
 I


have
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 I
 figure
 out.


I
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 moments
 where
 I


understand
 how
 my
 body
 is
 functioning,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 everything.
 I've
 just


had
 m
 I've
 just
 had
 moments
 of
 being


able
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 on
 myself


and
 um
 and
 so
 I'm
 always
 really
 open
 to


speak
 about
 the
 things
 I've
 learned
 just


because
 I
 see


>> that
 PCOS
 is
 so
 much
 like
 I
 say,
 I


describe
 it
 as
 a
 fingerprint.
 Every


person
 I
 know
 may
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of


this
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that
 like
 this


one
 and
 but
 it's
 so
 uniquely,


you
 know,
 made
 for
 them.
 Um
 but
 I
 also


think
 PCOS
 is
 such
 a
 special
 disorder


because
 while
 it
 has
 all
 these


challenges,
 it
 has
 forced
 me
 to
 pay


attention
 to
 my
 body
 uh
 very
 early
 in
 a


way
 that
 I
 didn't
 see
 my
 peers
 having
 to


pay
 attention
 to
 their
 body.
 My
 friends


didn't
 have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 their


body
 in
 this
 way.
 And
 and
 I
 I
 honestly


think
 like
 as
 I've
 aged,
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,


it's
 it's
 it's
 allowed
 me
 to
 have
 to


care
 for
 myself
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 wasn't


before,
 mentally,
 physically,


emotionally,
 even
 spiritually.
 Like


really
 having
 to
 think
 about


what
 it's
 like
 to
 be
 a
 woman
 in
 this


world.
 Also,
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 have
 a


body
 that
 is
 truly
 in
 flow.


>> Um,
 and
 how
 to
 just
 have
 it
 like
 that


all
 the
 time.
 time
 and
 I
 and
 I
 and
 I
 and


I
 am
 grateful.
 I'm
 grateful
 that
 I've


had
 that
 journey
 because
 I
 would
 not


have
 just
 like
 I
 said
 to
 you
 early
 on
 in


my
 before
 my
 diagnosis.
 No,
 I
 was


totally
 nonchalant
 about
 my
 body.
 I
 was


completely
 like
 doop
 like
 life
 happens.


I
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 great
 that
 um
 you've


turned
 it
 into
 because
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 feel


the
 same
 way
 too
 about
 uh
 fibroids


because
 yeah
 I
 think
 before
 I
 had
 all


this
 stuff
 I
 was
 really
 disconnected


from
 my
 body
 I
 just
 didn't
 even
 when
 I


was
 pregnant
 I
 think
 the
 first
 time
 that


I
 felt
 one
 of
 my
 kids
 kick
 I
 was
 like


what
 is
 happening
 I
 am
 the
 alien
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 um


what
 you
 said
 about
 being
 a
 forward-


facing
 person
 um
 how
 you
 look
 uh
 is
 a


part
 of
 the
 gig
 and
 considering
 like


your
 age
 being
 uh
 younger.
 Um
 I
 wanted


to
 just
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that


because
 I'm
 sure
 there
 were
 days
 when


there
 were
 frustrations
 that
 maybe
 your


body
 wasn't
 doing
 what
 you
 wanted
 it
 to


do
 or
 maybe
 somebody
 said
 something


about
 how
 you
 looked
 at
 you
 have
 long


hours,
 maybe
 you
 can't
 um
 eat
 certain


foods
 that
 you
 would
 normally
 eat
 to


manage
 your
 PCOS.
 Um,
 so
 what
 what
 would


you
 say
 has
 been
 the
 most
 challenging


part
 of
 learning
 how
 to
 manage
 PCOS?
 As


you
 said,
 it's
 a
 thumbrint.
 Doctors


don't
 really
 seem
 to
 know
 what
 causes


it,
 how
 to
 manage
 it,
 while
 you're


trying
 to
 build
 a
 successful
 career
 in


an
 industry
 that's
 so
 obsessed
 with
 uh


women
 looking
 uh
 a
 certain
 type
 a


certain
 way.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 I'm
 still
 navigating
 that.


You
 know,
 I
 shot
 I
 did
 a
 film
 a
 few


years
 ago
 and
 um
 we
 had
 a
 chunk
 of
 the


shoot
 that
 was
 overnight
 and
 for
 anybody


that
 doesn't
 know,
 it
 it
 was
 basically


like
 7
 to
 7.
 So,
 it's
 like
 we'd
 start
 at


7:00
 p.m.
 and
 we'd
 basically
 be
 ending


by
 7:00
 a.m.
 And
 um
 and
 it
 was
 really


hard.
 It
 was
 it
 overnight
 is
 hard


period.
 This
 was
 very
 hard.
 We
 were
 in
 a


fairly
 controlled
 environment.
 Um,
 and
 I


remember
 feeling
 really
 worried
 because


I
 just
 kept
 thinking,
 well,
 the
 stress


of
 this,
 no
 matter
 what
 I
 eat
 or
 how
 I


work
 out
 or
 how
 much
 sleep
 I
 try
 my
 best


to
 get,
 is
 going
 to
 take
 a
 toll
 on
 my


body
 and
 I
 may
 experience
 a
 flare
 up


just
 because
 of
 the
 stress
 of
 it.
 So,
 I


had
 to
 kind
 of
 really
 focus
 on


uh
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 meditation
 during
 that


time.
 I
 did
 a
 little
 walks
 during
 that


time.
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 low
 low
 and


slow
 is
 what
 I
 called
 it
 because
 I
 was


aware
 that
 that
 may
 shift
 how
 my
 body


shows
 up
 regardless
 of
 what
 I'm
 eating,


uh,
 sleeping,
 all
 of
 those
 kinds
 of


things.
 I've
 also
 had
 um
 an
 experience


that
 I
 had
 not
 this
 long
 ago
 that
 that
 I


was
 filming,
 but
 I
 was
 doing
 a
 lot
 of


travel.
 So,
 with
 this
 filming,
 was
 doing


a
 lot
 of
 travel,
 wasn't
 really
 sleeping


as
 well,
 and
 I
 didn't
 bring
 kind
 of
 like


what
 I
 say
 my
 go-to
 supplements.
 So,


it's
 like
 I
 always
 have
 magnesium
 with


me.
 I
 always
 have
 vitamin
 D
 with
 me.
 Um,


I
 always
 have
 zinc
 with
 me.
 And
 I
 wasn't


I
 didn't
 have
 any
 of
 those
 things
 with


me.
 And
 yes,
 by
 the
 end
 of
 that
 shoot,
 I


saw
 the
 difference.
 I
 looked
 different.


I
 felt
 different.
 All
 of
 those
 kinds
 of


things.
 And
 so
 it
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those


things
 that
 you
 are
 um
 you
 are
 aware
 and


and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 it's
 like
 my


journey
 has
 ha
 has
 had
 to
 have
 space
 for


me
 to
 just
 be
 the
 human
 to
 not
 always
 be


the
 entertainer
 to
 not
 always
 be
 the


person
 who's
 like
 shiny
 like
 a
 billboard


but
 to
 also
 recognize
 that
 I
 am
 a
 human


and
 so
 that
 that
 doesn't
 always
 look


perfect
 and
 there's
 I
 can
 do
 my
 best
 but


that's
 just
 the
 space
 that
 I
 am
 in.
 And


so
 I
 have
 had
 times
 when
 I
 can
 look
 on


something
 and
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 a
 flare
 up


was
 happening
 here."
 Or,
 "Yeah,
 this
 is


when
 no
 matter
 what
 I
 was
 trying,
 my


body
 was
 just
 not
 reacting
 to
 it.
 Uh,


this
 is
 when
 I
 shouldn't
 have
 been


eating
 this
 thing.
 This
 is
 when
 oh,
 I


was
 I
 was
 actually
 experimenting
 with


what
 I
 was
 eating."
 I
 can
 see
 all
 of


those
 things.
 And
 so,
 it
 is
 challenging


because
 yes,
 you
 are
 in
 an
 industry
 that


would
 naturally
 pick
 yourself
 apart
 even


if
 you
 didn't
 have
 these
 kind
 of


disorders.
 But
 I've
 been
 forced
 to
 give


myself
 some
 care.
 So,
 I
 I
 used
 to
 do
 a


lot
 of
 content
 on
 self-love
 and
 at
 that


time
 was
 because
 I
 was
 in
 the
 the
 early


stages
 of
 discovering
 my
 PCOS
 and
 I
 was


trying
 to
 navigate
 what
 my
 PCOS
 journey


looked
 like
 and
 it
 just
 the
 every
 time
 I


would
 research,
 every
 time
 I
 would
 feel


really
 frustrated,
 it
 forced
 me
 to
 have


to
 get
 back
 to
 self-love
 because
 um
 it's


so
 yeah,
 it's
 so
 complex
 and
 and
 to
 see


how
 much
 of
 your
 physical
 can
 be
 so
 out


of
 control
 because
 I'm
 fortunate.
 I
 I


don't
 suffer
 from
 the
 skin
 issues,
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 skin
 issues
 that
 come


with
 PCOS.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 you
 know,


hair
 that
 you
 have
 out
 of
 control.


There's
 women
 who
 are
 experiencing
 chin


hair
 or
 loss
 of
 hair
 and
 hair
 is
 such
 a


focus
 for
 beauty,
 right?


>> It's
 literally
 like
 for
 so
 many
 it's
 it


it
 really
 is.
 And
 so
 to
 experience
 those


types
 of
 challenges
 but
 still
 kind
 of


have
 to
 show
 up
 every
 single
 day
 is
 is


really
 hard.
 And
 so
 the
 women
 that
 I


know
 that
 are
 still
 navigating
 even


those
 spaces
 um
 and
 still
 figuring
 out


ways
 to
 show
 up,
 to
 feel
 beautiful,
 to


feel
 very
 excited
 about
 themselves.


Yeah.
 Um
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 even


explain
 to
 someone
 uh
 the
 nuance
 of
 what


it's
 like
 to
 also
 have
 to
 be
 on
 camera


and
 do
 those
 things.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 When
 I
 had
 um
 my
 in
 the
 midst


of
 my
 fibroids,
 my
 hair
 fell
 out
 and


Yeah.
 And
 uh
 it
 went
 bald
 in
 certain


places
 and
 it
 was
 horrendous.
 We
 have


about
 five
 minutes
 left.
 I
 mean,
 I
 could


talk
 to
 you
 for
 like
 five
 hours
 on
 this.


Um,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 two
 more


questions.
 Um,
 you've
 said
 that
 PCOS
 is


framed
 in
 a
 negative
 way.
 The
 focus
 is


that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 children


or
 you'll
 have
 trouble
 getting
 pregnant.


Why
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 flip


that
 and
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 positives?


>> Because
 I
 think
 this
 world
 is
 already
 so


hard.
 So,
 you're
 like,
 if
 if
 I
 was
 to


also
 think
 about
 all
 the
 negatives
 for


my
 body,
 I
 can't
 even
 imagine
 how
 it


would
 function
 because
 you're
 all
 of


these
 things
 meet,
 right?
 like
 the
 way
 I


think
 in
 here
 is
 the
 way
 I
 feel
 in
 here


is
 the
 way
 my
 body
 also
 shows
 up.
 Um
 I


had
 a
 fertility
 doctor
 say
 this
 to
 me.


She
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 no
 women
 with


PCOS
 actually
 have
 tons
 of
 eggs.
 She
 was


like,
 you
 have
 tons
 of
 eggs.
 You
 just


have
 to
 find
 them.
 That's
 all.
 You
 just


have
 to
 get
 to
 them.
 And
 she
 was
 like,


and
 I
 was
 like,
 oh,
 okay.
 You
 know,
 and


I
 was
 like,
 I
 I
 can
 rock
 with
 that.
 Like


that
 you
 have
 it's
 there.
 All
 the
 stuff


is
 there.
 I
 just
 have
 to
 I
 just
 got
 to


piece
 it
 together.
 And
 and
 that's
 how
 I


see
 PCOS
 that
 is
 as
 unique
 as
 it
 is.
 As


I've
 said,
 like
 that
 it's
 like
 a
 thumb


print.
 It
 is
 like
 this
 puzzle.
 It's
 this


unique
 puzzle
 for
 you.
 And
 so
 whenever
 I


see
 stories
 of
 uh
 people
 who
 do
 have


PCOS,
 but
 they
 are
 having
 their
 first


child
 or
 they're
 having
 their
 third


child
 or
 they
 are
 functioning
 like
 their


body
 is
 really
 working
 with
 them
 right


now
 or
 they're
 managing
 it
 or
 they
 feel


really
 good
 or
 they've
 controlled
 their


skin.
 Um
 it's
 it's
 never
 just
 that
 they


did
 that.
 It's
 also
 that
 they
 felt


better
 about
 themselves
 that
 they


started
 to
 treat
 themselves
 overall


better.
 So
 I
 think
 like
 you
 said


fibroids,
 endometriosis,
 these
 things


are
 challenging
 and
 we
 get
 to
 learn


about
 our
 body
 in
 a
 way
 that
 nobody
 else


does.
 Even
 so
 much
 so
 as
 going
 to
 a


doctor,
 somebody
 that
 you
 should
 trust,


a
 professional,
 and
 sometimes
 them
 not


even
 caring
 about
 your
 body
 as
 much
 as


you
 do.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 you
 are
 you
 you


realize
 that
 your
 true
 survival
 is
 in


positivity
 in
 really
 seeing
 this
 thing


as
 all
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 can
 um
 that
 you


can
 experience
 joy.
 All
 the
 ways
 that


you
 can
 actually
 flip
 the
 way
 it's


talked
 about,
 flip
 the
 way
 that
 it's


treated
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 this
 is
 not
 this


is
 not
 this
 thing.
 This
 is
 this
 for
 me.


For
 my
 experience,
 I
 need
 it
 to
 look


like
 this."
 And
 so
 PCOS,
 in
 order
 for
 me


to
 manage
 it,
 I
 have
 to
 only
 think
 that


this
 is
 just
 a
 unique
 body
 for
 me.


Everything
 about
 my
 life
 is
 unique
 and


so
 is
 my
 body.
 And
 the
 the
 fact
 that,


you
 know,
 I
 have
 to
 go
 on
 a
 slow
 walk


every
 single
 day
 is
 not
 a
 bad
 thing.


>> That's
 actually
 a
 good
 thing.
 And
 and


that
 I
 have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 what
 I


put
 in
 my
 body.
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I


have
 to
 think
 about
 my
 diet
 a
 little
 bit


differently
 than
 everybody
 else,
 but


still
 get
 to
 enjoy
 myself.
 That's
 not
 a


bad
 thing.
 It's
 sometimes
 frustrating,


but
 it's
 not
 a
 bad
 thing.


>> You're
 not
 broken.
 Um,
 I
 should
 I
 should


also
 mention
 because
 you've
 said
 it
 a


few
 times
 about
 why
 you
 can't
 run
 or
 you


shouldn't
 run.
 It's
 because
 the
 stress


that
 your
 body
 causes,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 technically.
 So,
 really,
 it's
 like


high
 intensity.
 High
 intensity
 workouts


are
 not
 your
 friend.
 So
 often
 times,
 um,


I
 have
 a
 friend
 kind
 of
 going
 through


this
 who
 told
 me
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 doing


all
 this
 high
 intensity
 and
 I'm
 not


losing
 any
 weight."
 And
 I
 had
 to
 say
 to


her,
 "You
 that
 that
 is
 a
 a
 PCOS
 problem.


You
 might
 not
 have
 PCOS,
 but
 that
 is


something
 that
 PCOS
 women
 deal
 with.
 The


stress
 is
 too
 much.
 You
 actually
 would


probably
 see
 more
 results
 if
 you
 slowed


everything
 down.
 If
 you
 did
 focus
 on


weights
 and
 lifting,
 but
 just
 slow.
 if


you
 did
 focus
 on
 a
 long
 walk
 instead.
 If


you
 want
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 uh


resistance,
 get
 a
 weighted
 vest,
 things


like
 that.
 I
 love
 running.
 I
 do
 run,
 but


I
 always
 tell
 people
 I'm
 actually
 a
 very


slow
 runner.
 I
 intentionally
 run
 slow


because
 I
 just
 enjoy
 running.
 It
 makes


me
 feel
 good,
 but
 I
 am
 not
 zipping


through
 because
 that's
 too
 stressful
 for


my
 body.
 I
 am
 truly
 doing
 a
 jog.
 I
 am


doing
 something
 light.
 I'm
 doing
 it


because
 I
 enjoy
 it.
 um
 and
 not
 because
 I


am
 pressuring
 myself
 to
 lose
 a
 ton
 of


weight
 with
 it.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 I
 I
 have


running
 journeys
 all
 the
 time.
 If
 I
 lose


2
 lbs,
 if
 I
 lose
 5
 lbs
 by
 the
 end
 of


months
 of
 running,
 I'm
 excited.
 I'm


like,


>> as
 long
 as
 you're
 as
 long
 as
 you're


healthy,
 um
 finally,
 uh
 you're
 from


Canada,
 but
 you're
 building
 your
 career


in
 Los
 Angeles.
 I
 wonder
 if
 there's
 any


difference
 when
 you
 get
 treatment
 in


Canada
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 United
 States.


um
 and
 what
 you
 would
 say
 to
 policy


makers
 about
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 live
 with


PCOS.


>> I
 think
 living
 with
 PCOS
 is
 is


challenging
 because


you
 have
 to
 do
 a
 checklist
 every
 single


uh
 day.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like
 am
 I
 feeling


sad
 because
 of
 life
 or
 am
 I
 feeling
 sad


because
 my
 hormonal
 my
 hormones
 are


completely
 imbalanced
 and
 I'm
 doing


something
 that's
 off
 and
 I
 haven't


gotten
 enough
 sleep
 and
 my
 body's
 not


functioning
 the
 way
 I
 need
 to.
 I'd
 say


the
 difference
 that
 I've
 seen
 in
 you
 in


the
 US
 uh
 obviously
 specifically
 Los


Angeles
 where
 I
 live
 is
 probably
 the
 use


of
 GLP1s
 um
 ompic
 anything
 like
 that
 is


is
 a
 lot
 more
 emphasized
 in
 the
 US
 in


terms
 of
 management
 of
 these
 kinds
 of


disorders
 because
 of
 the
 weight
 problems


that
 people
 often
 have.
 Whereas
 in


Canada,
 no,
 I
 I
 have
 to
 suggest
 it
 to


the
 doctor
 for
 them
 to
 um
 think
 that


it's
 something
 I
 should
 take.
 But
 and
 I


had
 the
 tiniest
 stint
 on
 Ompic
 and
 had


that
 I
 that
 I
 was
 diagnosed
 from
 Canada


or
 rather
 prescribed
 from
 Canada
 and


you're
 not
 even
 going
 to
 believe
 I
 ended


up
 gaining
 weight
 on
 it.
 So
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 this
 is
 not
 for
 me
 at
 all."
 like
 my


body
 did
 not
 react
 to
 it
 well
 in
 any
 way


and
 and
 I
 always
 think
 I
 was
 like
 if
 I


had
 gotten
 it
 in
 the
 US
 would
 I
 have
 had


that
 experience?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 But


again
 and
 it
 was
 something
 that
 I
 had
 to


bring
 up
 to
 my
 doctor
 h
 as
 something
 to


help
 me
 to
 manage
 my
 PCOS
 and
 um
 and


they
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 ah
 I
 guess
 so


versus
 in
 the
 US
 I
 think
 it
 is
 actually


a
 lot
 more
 um
 talked
 about
 and
 and
 more


freely
 prescribed.
 Um,
 so
 I'd
 say
 that


that's
 the
 difference,
 but
 I
 definitely


think
 I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 it's,
 as
 I


said,
 to
 to
 hear
 it
 being
 described
 as


the
 lazy
 girl
 disorder
 and
 um,
 and


something
 that
 is
 not
 thought
 about
 as,


well,
 what
 is
 your
 family
 history
 or
 how


did
 this
 thing
 kind
 of
 come
 about
 that


is
 is
 stumping
 us.
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 who


was
 later
 diagnosed
 with
 PCOS
 after


trying
 to
 have
 a
 child
 for
 over
 a
 year


and
 I
 they
 called
 it
 like
 mystery


infertility
 and
 it
 was
 actually
 PCOS


that
 was
 that
 was
 doing
 it
 but
 at
 first


they
 diagnosed
 her
 with
 mystery


infertility.
 Um
 and
 I
 just
 thought
 that


was
 crazy
 and
 so
 PCOS
 is
 still
 this


thing
 where
 it's
 it
 feels
 like
 people


are
 trying
 to
 avoid
 actually


understanding
 it.
 um
 the
 people
 who
 can


really
 make
 a
 difference
 and
 and
 so


that's
 why
 the
 community
 for
 it
 is
 so


important.
 That's
 why
 you
 will
 find
 all


these
 pages
 online
 and
 people
 like


myself
 that
 talk
 about
 it
 because
 in
 the


community
 is
 where
 we've
 had
 to
 figure


it
 out
 because
 if
 you
 were
 to
 go
 to
 the


professionals,
 it's
 kind
 of
 it's
 kind
 of


dismissed.
 It's
 it's
 dismissed
 till
 this


day.
 Um
 well
 next
 on
 the
 next
 episode
 of


mistreated
 we're
 speaking
 to
 a


researcher
 on
 p
 uh
 who
 researches
 PCOS


and
 she
 also
 has
 it
 and
 I'll
 ask
 her


about
 and
 about
 some
 of
 the
 treatments


that
 are
 coming
 up.
 But
 Andrea
 this
 has


been
 a
 wonderful
 conversation.
 Uh
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 making
 time
 to
 speak


with
 us
 and
 also
 for
 what
 you're
 doing


for
 the
 PCOS
 community.
 Really


appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having


me
 and
 for
 you.
 This
 is
 great.
 I
 think


there
 should
 be
 more
 conversations
 about


women's
 reproductive
 health
 and
 the


things
 that
 we
 go
 through
 and
 you
 know


and
 and
 truly
 like
 if
 there's
 a
 link
 or


if
 just
 the
 challenges
 between
 PCOS,


endometriosis
 and
 fibroids
 and
 how


challenging
 they
 are
 especially
 for


women
 of
 color.


>> At least
 we're
 talking
 about
 it
 now.
 So,


it's
 a
 start.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you,
 Andrea.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you.
 Bye.
