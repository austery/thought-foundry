 highlight


episode

 really
 in
 a
 hurry
 we're
 going
 to


clip
 down
 the
 episode

minute
 long
 but
 probably
 what
 you'll
 see


when
 you
 heard
 10
 minutes
 you're
 going


to
 want
 to
 hear
 the
 whole
 thing
 now
 what


we
 do
 Wednesday
 full
 episode
 Fridays
 the


short
 episode
 tune


in
 hi
 everyone
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 be
 here


with
 Yen
 stoltenberg
 who
 just
 finished


off
 uh
 as
 the
 Secretary
 General
 in
 NATO


and
 before
 NATO
 he
 was
 the
 Prime


Minister
 of
 Norway
 warm
 welcome
 y
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me
 so
 I'm
 having


here
 um
 you
 know
 a
 book
 which
 uh
 you


wrote
 uh
 which
 came
 out
 8
 years
 ago


which
 basically
 covered
 the
 period
 until


10
 years
 ago
 and
 it's
 got
 a
 beautiful


picture
 of
 you
 on
 the
 on
 the
 front
 here


um
 but
 just
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


most
 important
 changes
 in
 the
 world


since
 that
 book
 came
 out
 the
 most


important
 changes
 at
 least
 related
 to
 my


task
 my
 my
 responsibilities
 in
 NATO
 is


that
 uh
 the
 world
 has
 become
 more


dangerous
 the
 good
 that's
 the
 bad
 news


the
 good
 news
 is
 that
 NATO
 has
 become


stronger
 to
 protect
 close
 to
 1
 billion


people
 um
 um
 of
 course
 there
 are
 many


other
 changes
 but
 but
 but
 seen
 from
 a


security
 perspective
 we
 have
 now
 a


fullscale
 war
 in
 Europe
 uh
 we
 have
 uh
 a


new
 very
 devastating
 conflict
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 risk
 of
 escalation
 and
 we


have
 significantly
 more


Global
 rivalry
 between
 great
 Powers


United
 States
 China
 um
 uh
 and
 then
 we


have
 cyber
 hybrid
 terrorist
 threats
 as
 a


constant
 threat
 to
 our
 security
 so
 so


fundamentally
 we
 live
 in
 a
 more


unpredictable
 more
 uh
 uh
 dangerous
 world


and
 we
 have
 done
 for
 decades
 if
 we
 um


cover
 some
 of
 these
 points
 here
 so
 how


do
 you
 think
 the
 Ukraine
 situation
 will


end
 what's
 the
 most
 likely
 Wars
 are
 by


Nature
 extremely
 unpredictable


unpredictable
 so
 therefore
 I
 will
 be


very
 careful
 predicting
 how
 that
 will


end
 um
 but
 um
 um
 of
 course
 we
 all
 want


this
 war
 to
 end
 the
 challenge
 is
 that
 uh


the
 quickest
 way
 to
 end
 the
 war
 is
 to


lose
 a
 war
 uh
 but
 that
 will
 not
 lead
 to


peace
 that
 will
 lead
 to
 occupation
 of


Ukraine
 and
 Ukraine
 will
 not
 be
 a


sovereign
 independent
 Democratic
 nation


in
 Europe
 and
 anymore
 it
 will
 be
 a


country
 controlled
 by
 by
 Moscow
 so
 if


you
 want
 the
 war
 to
 end
 in
 a
 way
 where


millions
 of
 ukrainians
 still
 can
 live
 in


a
 free
 Democratic
 Society
 then
 we
 need


to
 convince
 President
 Putin
 that
 he
 will


not
 win
 on
 the
 battlefield
 that
 he
 has


to
 sit
 down
 and
 negotiate
 agree
 uh
 a


solution
 where
 Ukraine
 uh
 can
 still
 be
 a


sovereign
 uh
 Democratic
 Nation
 the
 fact


that
 there
 are
 stronger
 and
 stronger


links
 between
 the
 autocrats
 in
 the
 world


what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 the
 Western
 world
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be


uh
 together
 when
 we
 see
 that
 the


autocrats
 are
 more
 and
 more
 aligned
 and


then
 of
 course
 that's
 partly
 we
 meaning


partly
 NATO
 allies
 so
 32
 Nations
 on
 the


both
 sou
 Atlantic
 but
 also
 with
 other


countries
 which
 at
 least
 don't
 to
 be


don't
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 a
 kind
 of


autocratic
 Alliance
 and
 again
 Ukraine
 is


perhaps
 the
 the
 clearest
 example
 Russia


is
 responsible
 for
 war
 aggression
 the


main
 providers
 of
 weapons
 uh
 and
 and


enablers
 of
 that
 war
 is
 north
 Korea
 uh


Iran
 and
 China
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 this
 is


not
 rhetoric
 this
 is
 this
 is
 really
 this


is
 real
 and
 makes
 a
 difference
 on
 the


battlefield
 and
 we
 also
 also
 see
 how


Russia
 and
 China
 are
 exercising
 more


together
 um
 also
 around
 Japan
 uh
 um
 uh


and
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 so
 so
 this


is
 really
 Global
 picture
 that
 makes
 it


even
 more
 important
 that
 of
 course
 Nat


to
 allies
 stand
 together
 but
 also
 that


we
 work
 with
 Partners
 all
 around
 the


world
 including
 South
 Korea
 Japan
 and


many
 other
 countries
 there
 are
 some


voices
 that
 want
 the
 EU
 to
 play
 a
 more


important
 part
 in
 defense
 policy
 what
 is


your
 view
 on
 that
 my
 view
 is
 that
 if


it's
 done
 in
 the
 right
 way
 it's
 very


good
 if
 it's
 done
 in
 the
 wrong
 way
 it's


very
 bad
 uh
 so
 what's
 the
 right
 way
 and


the
 right
 way
 is
 that
 EU
 should
 do
 more


and
 they
 and
 and
 they
 have
 started
 to


step
 up
 uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 for
 instance


strengthening
 the
 defense
 industry


meaning
 overcoming
 the
 fragmentation
 of


the
 European
 Defense
 uh
 industry
 uh
 um


to
 increase
 defense


spending
 uh
 and
 to
 and
 to
 in
 general


strengthen
 European
 uh
 uh
 uh
 defenses


meaning
 that
 that
 that
 will
 also


strengthen
 NATO
 good
 space
 yeah
 you


cover
 a
 lot
 of
 issues
 yeah
 well
 there


are
 well
 so
 the
 world
 is
 so
 complex


right
 it
 is
 it
 is
 what's
 going
 on
 in


space
 from
 a
 Warfare
 point
 of
 view
 so


first
 I
 think
 what
 we
 see
 is
 that
 is


more
 and
 more
 weaponization
 of
 space
 and


and
 what
 happens
 in
 space


space
 matters
 more
 and
 more
 for
 what's


going
 on
 on
 the
 earth
 that's
 obvious
 for


communications
 GPS
 cyber
 and
 then
 of


course
 targeting
 a
 lot
 of
 military


operations
 in
 Ukraine
 are
 dependent
 on


uh
 satellites
 in
 in
 in
 space
 and
 and
 any


future
 conflict
 space
 uh
 will
 be


important
 uh
 what
 we
 also
 then
 see
 is


that
 again
 Russia
 and
 China
 are


developing
 capabilities
 that
 can


actually
 be
 used
 as
 offensive
 weapons
 uh


and
 this
 is
 a
 dangerous
 uh
 uh
 um


development
 in
 a
 way
 a
 bit
 related
 to


that
 AI
 what
 are
 the
 issues
 surrounding


that
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Warfare
 some


people
 uh
 in
 America
 say
 that
 we
 should


build
 AI
 into
 everything
 we
 do
 into
 all


the
 weapons
 all
 the
 cars
 everything


right
 to
 beat
 the
 Chinese
 in
 this
 kind


of
 fight
 what
 how
 do
 you
 see
 AI
 impact


in
 Warfare
 I
 think
 what
 is
 obvious
 that


AI
 has
 and
 will
 even
 more
 so
 in
 the


future
 change
 nature
 of
 warfare
 uh


perhaps
 as
 fundamental
 as
 Industrial


Revolution
 did
 I
 think
 we
 see
 something


similar
 now
 a
 fundamental
 shift
 where
 we


don't
 fully
 understand
 but
 but
 but


autonomous
 systems
 uh
 facial
 recognition


um
 drones
 cyber
 attacks
 by
 using
 also
 AI


is
 has
 the
 potential
 of
 changing
 Warfare


so
 much
 that
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 fully
 uh


understand
 uh
 the
 full
 implications
 we


have
 SE
 we
 have
 already
 seen
 it
 on
 the


battlefield
 in
 uh
 Ukraine
 it's
 not
 the


secret
 that
 some
 of
 the
 drones
 and
 the


surveillance
 systems
 that
 NATO
 operates


also
 uses
 AI
 uh
 to
 process
 information


so
 this
 is
 a
 this
 has
 already
 started


but
 we
 only
 seen
 the
 beginning
 of
 a


fundamental
 change
 of
 the
 natural


Warfare
 you
 ran
 this
 country
 um
 during


the
 July
 attack
 uh
 the
 terror
 attacks


that
 we
 had
 and
 you
 know
 through
 the


Ukraine
 situation
 in
 NATO
 what
 are
 the


how
 does
 one
 lead
 uh
 during
 these


traumatic
 situations
 what's
 the
 key
 to


story
 it's
 to
 remain
 calm
 in
 a
 way
 um


and
 to
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 sleep


uh
 uh
 uh
 because
 U
 it
 is
 important
 to
 be


able
 to
 function
 uh
 so
 I've
 seen
 some


people
 in
 crisis
 exhausting
 them


themselves
 too
 early
 M
 how
 do
 you
 work


with


feelings
 I'm
 a
 bit
 strange
 there
 because


when
 the
 crisis
 are
 acute
 i
 i
 i
 suppress


them
 I
 just
 keep
 keep
 them
 away
 and
 and


in
 one
 way
 I
 think
 that
 helps
 me
 dealing


with
 feelings
 is
 it


lonely
 it
 is
 lonely
 but
 but
 perhaps
 less


lonely
 that's
 that
 people
 believe
 if


there's
 anything
 I'm
 quite
 good
 at
 is
 to


uh
 allow
 people
 to
 help
 me
 talking
 about


um
 people
 just
 how
 you
 at
 NATO
 you've


been
 dealing
 with
 um
 you
 know
 people
 who


are
 perceived
 to
 have
 you
 know
 large
 uh


egos
 I
 guess
 what's
 the
 key
 to
 reaching


consensus
 with
 them
 and
 getting
 to


agreement
 no
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 taking


their
 concerns
 seriously
 and
 to
 even
 if


we
 disagree
 on
 many
 issues
 we
 may
 they


may
 Al
 actually
 also
 have
 relevant


points
 and
 uh
 and
 concerns
 and
 uh


without
 being
 too
 specific
 of
 course


there
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 of


how
 did
 we
 manage
 four
 years
 of
 uh


president
 Trump
 in
 the
 white
 house
 um


and
 and
 and
 it's
 no
 no
 secret
 that
 I


disagree
 with
 him
 on
 trade
 or
 abortion


or
 or
 climate
 change
 but
 that
 is
 that


was
 not
 core
 issues
 for
 NATO
 so
 what
 I


focused
 on
 was
 what
 matters
 for
 NATO
 and


actually
 on
 those
 issues
 we
 were
 had


yeah
 a
 large
 degree
 of
 agreement
 his


main
 message
 was
 that
 European
 allies


had
 to
 invest
 more
 in
 events
 he
 conveyed


that
 message
 in
 a
 way
 which
 was
 a
 bit


say
 not
 as
 didn't
 use


conver
 different
 than
 than
 many
 other


political
 leaders
 but
 but
 the
 core
 of


that
 message
 was
 something
 was


absolutely
 the
 same
 as
 President
 Obama


had
 done
 before
 him
 or
 President
 Biden


does
 now
 uh
 and
 I
 took
 that
 concern


seriously
 and
 I
 think
 that
 helped
 the


same
 with
 with
 with
 President
 erogan


people
 asked
 me
 how
 how
 does
 that
 work


well
 he
 has
 expressed
 serious
 concerns


about
 the
 fact
 that
 no
 other
 country


NATO
 all
 country
 have
 suffered
 more


terrorist
 attacks
 than
 than
 than
 turkey


so
 take
 that
 seriously
 so
 I
 think
 focus


on
 the
 issues
 uh
 uh
 that's
 the
 best
 way


of
 uh
 uh


addressing
 strong
 political
 leaders
