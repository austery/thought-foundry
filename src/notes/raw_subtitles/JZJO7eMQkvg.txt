Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
Today I still want to talk to you about Chinese education
In this December 8th issue, we will talk about learning trauma
After the video is released
Many netizens talked to me about this.
Some of their difficulties in reading and writing
for example
Feeling upset when reading certain long passages
For example
When writing, I always feel that my thoughts are fragmented.
Difficulty concentrating
These obstacles
To a large extent
It can be attributed to China's poor language education
Their sharing also gave me a lot of new ideas
So what about this video?
Let’s discuss this.
Language Education in China
How does it destroy reading and writing skills?
at last
We will also talk about the underlying logic of this kind of language education
Let me say one more thing before we start
If you are interested in today's video
or
Do you have any topic you want to discuss with me?
You can contact my email to make an appointment
Let's get back to our topic today.
In the previous video
We have mentioned
In China's primary and secondary schools
Mathematics plays a decisive role in the overall score
Because mathematics is more important than Chinese, English and other subjects
It is easier to widen the score gap
And because of good math grades
More likely to be seen as a sign of high intelligence
therefore
Mathematics is also the easiest to hit students' self-esteem and confidence
This is certainly good
But most people leave school
Complex mathematics is rarely used
Basic mathematical logic is sufficient to handle most problems
Therefore, once you leave the test environment
Mathematics education has little impact on people
In contrast
Thinking patterns and reading habits cultivated by Chinese education
It may last a lifetime
Because most people after leaving school
Still use Chinese as a medium for reading, writing,
The main language of expression and thinking
therefore
The harm caused by Chinese language education to Chinese students
Although more difficult to detect
But it is more serious in depth and scope
Now let's talk about Chinese language education in China.
I think a lot of people will have this memory.
Students generally think that Chinese classes are boring.
I am tired of Chinese class
Dislike and rejection
Although mathematics classes also make many students disgusted
But this resentment
It's more of a fear caused by not understanding.
Few students take mathematics lightly.
Because mathematics uses a set of abstract and unfamiliar symbols
Students first need to take the time to understand
These logical deductions
But mathematics education
The requirements for teachers’ language skills are not high.
The teaching objectives of mathematics education are definite
Clear
Even quantifiable
The content is also highly structured
The evaluation system is relatively simple and objective
therefore
Students are not likely to form the impression that math classes are easy
In contrast
The teachers and students in the Chinese language class are all native speakers
Therefore, Chinese teachers need to show
Much higher language proficiency than the average native speaker
Contents of Chinese Language Teaching
Involving literature, history,
Philosophy, art and many other fields
This objectively
Chinese teachers need to have a wider range of knowledge
In order to integrate rich background knowledge into teaching
Help students understand and stimulate their interest
In addition, Chinese classes also involve the study of
Character motivations,
Emotional and cognitive control
This also requires teachers to have a certain degree of empathy
and understanding of the complexity of human nature
Therefore, the surface threshold of mathematics education is relatively high
Learners need to take the time to understand the language of mathematics
But once you understand
It is not difficult to understand
Because the relationship between mathematical symbols
It is highly precise and regular
No ambiguity
On the surface, the threshold for Chinese education is very low.
It seems that all you need is to be able to speak and write.
But the upper limit of language ability
It's not just about being able to explain
It is more about being precise, profound and contagious.
Languages
It is also reflected in the ability to understand metaphors in literary works,
Symbolism and imagery
This requires readers to have a broad perspective
and rich emotions
Therefore, we say
The ceiling of language education is quite high
This is in contrast to the poor status quo of Chinese language education in reality.
A contrast
This is first reflected in the teaching methods of Chinese classes.
Explain a text in a Chinese language class in Chinese primary and secondary schools
Generally in this order
First explain the meaning of the word
That is, the teacher leads the students to read the text through
Point out unfamiliar Chinese characters or words
Then have students divide the paragraphs
Count how many sentences there are
Analyze the components of a sentence
Then comes the main idea of ​​the summary paragraph
Summarize the main idea
Finally, let’s analyze the writing characteristics and writing techniques.
However
This is actually a very mechanical
Stereotyped and empty explanation routine
Because it puts an article
Dissecting into paragraphs, words, sentences, and punctuation marks
Mechanical combination of writing skills
So that students can only focus on this surface form
Unable to deeply understand the core content and emotions of the article
We say
Reading is more than just understanding the text
More so with the author
Dialogue and communication of thoughts and emotions
In the video about Chinese mathematics education
We actually mentioned the importance of dialogue.
Dialogue can be said to be the core of all education and learning
This kind of mechanical language education
It makes it difficult for students to feel
Emotional resonance and touch with the author
It stifles students' ability to grasp the overall article
For example, an essay
The students only remembered this sentence.
Use metaphors, parallelism and other rhetorical devices
But it is difficult to feel the emotions conveyed by the author
Although the teacher will summarize
This article conveys a certain emotion of the author
But this kind of summary is often a forced summary.
Students lack the ability to understand this emotion.
Related knowledge and background
Just to get points
And have to accept the teacher's top-down indoctrination
We say
A good article can be interpreted in many ways.
But this mechanical education
Only allow you to see from one angle
To summarize the main idea
Understand the author's thoughts and feelings
Students who have received this kind of education for a long time
Not easy to be inclusive
They also lack the ability to look at problems from multiple perspectives.
We also mentioned this in our video on December 1st.
In China
Many people have a very narrow sense of right and wrong.
This is also a product of China's rigid education system.
That is to remember the correct answer
As the key to high scores
The history of human thought
Interpretation: The elimination of wrong ideas by correct ideas
For example, the struggle between materialism and idealism
The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie
This view of right and wrong holds
truth
It is based on the elimination and removal of wrong ideas.
However
The progress of human thought
It is precisely based on integration and compatibility
Nothing is absolutely wrong
Certain ideas that have been scientifically denied and abandoned
It's just not explanatory enough.
But it's not a mistake
Moreover, science is not the only truth.
Widely accepted and experienced
and accumulate different knowledge and concepts
Much more important than right or wrong
Because this accumulation
Provides a foundation for future integration capabilities
And that is the key to creativity
However
Many Chinese people tend to
They must immediately look for a fixed
Absolutely orthodox standards
Intolerance of diverse perspectives and possibilities
This state of affairs can certainly be traced back to
The mechanical and stereotyped nature of Chinese education
This often has a more far-reaching impact than the teaching content.
Here we take a classic text
Take Lychee Honey as an example
Maybe many friends don’t know this article.
So let me first give you a brief background.
Author Yang Shuo
Born in 1913
He is famous for his elegant prose.
In 1939, he joined the Eighth Route Army and engaged in literary and artistic work
Arrived in Yan'an in 1942
And participated in the Yan'an Rectification Movement
Worked as a reporter for Xinhua News Agency during the Chinese Civil War
After 1949
Yang Shuo held several important positions in the literary and artistic circles
His works were included in the Chinese language textbooks at that time.
After the Cultural Revolution
He was listed as a key target of criticism by the rebels
Suicide in 1968
So
Let’s take a look
What does this classic elementary school text say?
The author first wrote
He was once stung by a bee
I feel like bees are uncomfortable creatures.
One day he was in a beautiful place
I saw lychee trees all over the mountains.
then
Saw swarms of bees flying around.
The author said: Maybe
What new life are the bees trying to build?
Then
The author met the beekeeper Lao Liang
Lao Liang took him to visit the beehive
And said: "Look at these little things
Be more obedient"
The author asked Lao Liang
How much honey can a hive of bees produce in a year?
Lao Liang said that bees love to work.
All year round
Leave a little bit of sugar for the bees each time
Just enough for them to eat.
They never fight
Don't care about anything
Still continue to work
Working tirelessly all day and all month
The author further asked:
How long can a bee live?
Lao Liang said: I can only live for six months at most
The author asked:
Then you always have to clean outside.
Dead bees?
Lao Liang replied:
Bees are very smart
Live to the end of life
He died quietly outside.
Never coming back
So the author sighed: How cute bees are!
No demands on humans
Give people the best things
Although bees are tiny
But how noble!
Then the author began to look out at the fields in the distance.
I saw many farmers planting rice.
He also dreamed that he turned into a bee
After listening to this text
I don't know what you guys think.
I saw a Chinese teaching plan
This is how I explain Lychee Honey
first
The lesson plan points out that this essay is poetic.
Creates a beautiful and interesting artistic conception
It uses a double-line structure of using objects to represent people
The metaphor is bee
In the article is a bright line
The main body is the working people
In the article is a hidden line
Two lines sometimes intersect and sometimes run parallel
Providing readers with space for imagination and aftertaste
certainly
Although these techniques are diverse
But it must be unified under the central idea of ​​the article
So what is the central idea of ​​this article?
The teaching objectives state:
Inspire students to love the new socialist life
Love for the working people
Then the lesson plan says
The teaching focus of this text is to make students understand
How the author praises bees
How to praise the working people?
Students need to find out
Those sentences praising bees and working people
And need to be aware of
What bees and working people have in common is
Selfless work and dedication
The next question is
Require students to understand
The smallness and nobility of bees
Why is it not contradictory?
The lesson plan says that small refers to the size of the bee.
And nobility refers to the character of bees
Okay, now let’s review it.
First, the so-called double-line structure mentioned in the lesson plan
Actually
It is to guide students towards a fixed framework of understanding.
that is
We must unite bees with working people
This actually killed the students.
Autonomous thinking and feelings
On the surface, the lesson plan mentioned
It is a purely neutral and technical writing technique
But in fact, this technique
It also has a clear meaning of indoctrination and brainwashing.
That is to say, the working people and the bees are recognized
There is some commonality
The more serious problem is that
The idea conveyed by this text
Not only is there a problem
Even terrible
Bees themselves, of course, have no self-awareness.
All its actions have no moral significance
But the idea the author wants to express is
This kind of day and night labor
Even if I'm dying, I'd rather die outside
A creature that does not cause trouble to others
It's really great
So noble
This is obviously meant for humans.
However, this kind of moral education is also quite terrible.
If I didn't ask a person if they were willing
Just take his efforts and sacrifices for granted.
Praise his noble selflessness
So is this behavior ethical?
From here we seem to be able to find
Chinese society is accustomed to
The atmosphere of glorifying victims
Once we realize this
Then the author creates in the article
The so-called poetic and beautiful artistic conception
It's gone.
Under the high-sounding moral ethics
Hidden is a rather dark scheme and calculation
This perspective
Of course, it is more realistic in contemporary China.
Although I really don't like this text
But I think
It is very suitable as a tool to inspire students' critical thinking
and widely connected materials
In our previous video
I mentioned
The learning process
is a continuous emotional and cognitive experience
Therefore, the extensive interdisciplinary connections
Often more than teaching limited to a certain field
Can stimulate students' interest in learning
If I were a Chinese teacher
I will inspire students
Pay attention to the text "Lychee Honey"
Richer details and historical background
This will help students
Understand from a more three-dimensional and macro perspective
I will not presume to have a central idea for this article.
But starting from various details
Together with the students
To explore and find the truth of this article
for example
I might remind students to
This text mentions a detail
The bee farm is located in the "Hot Spring Commune"
So when did the concept of "commune" begin?
This can be linked to history
Students who are familiar with history will know
This is a concept that was not invented until 1958.
Then
We can naturally
Transition to creative time
In fact, the essay "Lychee Honey"
Written by Yang Shuo in 1961
This is an extremely important time background.
What happened in 1961?
At that time, due to the Great Leap Forward
The famine and severe economic crisis caused
It has continued into the third year
Tens of millions starved to death
Most of the rest are struggling on the brink of starvation.
The lives of the privileged classes have also been generally affected
so
Even the most under-informed central leaders
At the end of 1960, the seriousness of the problem was also realized.
Some error correction and deviation correction policies have also been issued.
Yang Shuo was not completely ignorant
But Yang Shuo still said in his article
Bees are still building a new life
It seems that they have not yet woken up from the dream of the Great Leap Forward
Yang Shuo is obviously a person with many privileges.
He can be in Conghua, Guangdong
Kunming and Beidaihe Tours
Stay in a luxury hotel with hot springs and beautiful scenery
From his works
You don't see any hunger, scarcity or pain.
On the contrary, 1961 was a peak period for his creation.
In this year
In addition to Lychee Honey
He wrote "Snow Waves" and "Ode to Camellia"
These beautiful essays
The style of these essays is full of poetry,
Laid-back and relaxed
He wrote, "Eating such good honey
You will feel that life is sweet."
He should know
Even if he really dreamed that he turned into a bee
His life in the sanatorium and the scenic area
The lives of the farmers he saw were also different.
If students knew this background information
We can learn from the saying "bees are very sensible"
Even if I die, I won’t cause any trouble to others.”
Read a dark and depressing meaning
That’s all for today’s video.
