I've
 spent
 three
 decades
 reverse


engineering
 the
 human
 mind
 to
 show
 you


how
 you
 can
 use
 it
 to
 know
 what


somebody's
 thinking
 when
 they
 meet
 you


or
 if
 somebody
 was
 telling
 you
 the
 truth


or
 lying.
 So,
 let's
 do
 something
 fun.


Imagine
 that
 in
 front
 of
 you
 was
 an


invisible
 deck
 of
 cards.
 Spread
 them
 out


in
 front
 of
 you.
 And
 I
 want
 you
 to
 reach


down
 and
 imagine
 you
 just
 grab
 a
 card
 at


random.
 Now,
 look
 at
 it.
 Look
 at
 me.


Okay,
 close
 your
 eyes.
 Hold
 your
 hand


out,
 please.
 Now,
 before
 you
 open
 your


eyes
 and
 tell
 us
 what
 was
 that
 card,


>> three
 of
 diamonds.
 H


>> open
 your
 eyes.
 Take
 a
 look.


[Music]


And
 it's
 not
 magic.
 I
 can't
 teach
 you


this.
 And
 these
 secrets,
 these
 habits,


they're
 applicable
 all
 throughout
 life.


Trust
 me,
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 miss
 the


rest
 of
 this.


>> O
 Pearlman
 walked
 away
 from
 Wall
 Street


to
 become
 the
 world's
 leading
 mentalist,


unlocking
 the
 skills
 we
 need


>> to
 read
 people,
 win
 trust,
 spot
 a
 liar,


and
 influence
 anyone.


>> My
 whole
 job
 is
 to
 make
 you
 believe
 that


I
 can
 read
 minds.
 But
 here
 is
 the
 honest


truth.
 That's
 impossible.
 But
 I
 read


people
 through
 small,
 minute
 details.


For
 example,
 we're
 hardwired
 from


thousands
 of
 years
 that
 if
 I
 approach


you
 directly
 with
 two
 eyes,
 it
 can


create
 fear
 versus
 if
 I
 turn
 ever
 so


slightly
 and
 approach
 you
 with
 one
 eye.


That
 one
 eye
 is
 less
 danger.
 So,
 it's


all
 about
 the
 smallest
 little
 nuances.


Like,
 think
 of
 someone,
 think
 of
 their


first
 name.
 I
 got
 it.
 Five
 letters,


isn't
 it?
 Tell
 us
 all
 what
 is
 their


first
 name.


>> Jules.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 tactical


advantage
 when
 you
 ask
 your
 boss
 for
 a


raise
 or
 when
 you
 ask
 someone
 out
 on
 a


date.
 And
 I'll
 explain
 to
 you
 what
 to
 do


as
 well
 as
 how
 you
 form
 habits,


eliminating
 that
 fear
 of
 rejection,
 and


also
 the
 fast
 track
 for
 confidence.
 But


the
 next
 thing
 is
 how
 to
 improve
 your


memory,
 which
 is
 a
 huge
 secret
 to


success.
 And
 I
 have
 a
 tip.
 I've


repurposed
 the
 instructions
 on
 a
 shampoo


bottle.
 And
 the
 first
 step
 is
 what
 95%


of
 us
 do
 wrong.
 So,


I
 see
 messages
 all
 the
 time
 in
 the


comments
 section
 that
 some
 of
 you
 didn't


realize
 you
 didn't
 subscribe.
 So,
 if
 you


could
 do
 me
 a
 favor
 and
 double
 check
 if


you're
 a
 subscriber
 to
 this
 channel,


that
 would
 be
 tremendously
 appreciated.


It's
 the
 simple,
 it's
 the
 free
 thing


that
 anybody
 that
 watches
 this
 show


frequently
 can
 do
 to
 help
 us
 here
 to


keep
 everything
 going
 in
 this
 show
 in


the
 trajectory
 it's
 on.
 So,
 please
 do


double
 check
 if
 you've
 subscribed
 and
 uh


thank
 you
 so
 much
 because
 a
 strange
 way


you
 are,
 you're
 part
 of
 our
 history
 and


you're
 on
 this
 journey
 with
 us
 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 for
 that.
 So,
 yeah,
 thank


you.


O
 Pman,


you're
 a
 guy
 who
 can
 apparently
 read


people's
 minds.
 In
 fact,
 the
 book
 you've


just
 written
 is
 called
 Read
 Your
 Mind:


Proven
 Habits
 for
 Success
 from
 the


World's
 Greatest
 Mentalist.
 So,
 for


anyone
 that
 isn't
 familiar
 with
 your


work
 and
 what
 you
 do,
 why
 did
 you
 name


your
 book
 Read
 Your
 Mind?
 And
 can
 you


read
 my
 mind?


>> So,
 therein
 lies
 the
 dilemma.
 My
 whole


job
 is
 to
 make
 you
 believe
 that
 I
 can


read
 minds.
 But
 here
 is
 the
 honest


truth.
 I
 can't
 read
 minds.
 I
 wish
 I


could
 read
 minds.
 That's
 impossible.
 I


read
 people.
 Very
 different
 skill.
 This


is
 built
 on
 the
 world
 of
 magic.
 What
 I


do.
 Misdirection,
 influence,
 suggestion.


Knowing
 how
 people
 think
 indicates
 to
 me


what
 they
 think.
 Right?
 I've
 spent
 three


decades
 reverse
 engineering
 the
 human


mind.
 I'm
 teaching
 you
 habits
 for


success
 because
 the
 skills
 that
 I
 have


at
 reading
 people
 effectively,
 walking


into
 a
 room,
 taking
 charge,
 influencing


them.
 All
 of
 the
 things
 surrounding
 the


entertainment
 portion
 are
 things
 that


apply
 to
 everyone.
 If
 you
 can
 use
 these


secrets,
 these
 habits,
 they're
 going
 to


lead
 you
 to
 success
 in
 your
 personal


life,
 in
 your
 professional
 life,
 in
 your


relationships.
 And
 that's
 what
 I've


done.
 I
 think
 that
 if
 I
 had
 done
 this


same
 playbook
 and
 not
 been
 a
 mentalist,


I'd
 be
 successful
 at
 any
 field.
 They're


applicable
 all
 throughout
 life.
 You


know,
 I'm
 pausing
 for
 one
 second
 because


someone
 listening
 to
 this
 right
 now,
 I'm


always
 thinking
 about
 the
 person
 there


watching
 us.


>> And
 why
 should
 they
 be
 watching
 me
 right


now?
 That's
 my
 question.
 Who
 cares
 about


me?
 I
 don't
 know
 me.
 They
 don't
 know
 me.


Why
 should
 they
 watch
 this?
 I've
 studied


you.
 That's
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living.
 And


I
 have
 something
 for
 you.
 And
 on


Dragon's
 Day,
 I
 love
 when
 you
 make
 an


offer.
 I
 love
 the
 visual
 of
 the
 moment


where
 you
 can
 change
 someone's
 life,


right?
 A
 founder,
 you
 evaluate
 their


company.
 You
 make
 them
 an
 offer.
 So,


this
 is
 an
 offer,
 but


it's
 not
 for
 now.
 You
 have
 to
 stick


around
 till
 the
 end.
 If
 you
 open
 it
 now,


it
 will
 be
 meaningless.
 At
 the
 end
 of


this
 podcast,
 you're
 going
 to
 open
 this


piece
 of
 paper,
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 something
 you
 will
 talk
 about
 for


years
 to
 come.
 You
 know
 what?
 Put
 it


somewhere,
 maybe
 right
 under
 your
 mug


where
 it
 never
 leaves
 our
 site,
 and


we're
 going
 to
 come
 back
 to
 this
 later.


>> I'm
 going to
 put


>> You
 know
 what
 this
 is?
 It's
 your
 future.


>> This
 is
 my
 future


>> 100%.


Don't
 open.
 You
 don't
 want to
 know
 your


future
 yet.


>> And
 why
 should
 they
 stick
 around
 and


listen?
 Oh,
 because
 trust
 me,
 you
 don't


want
 to
 miss
 the
 rest
 of
 this.


Otherwise,
 you'll
 have
 to
 see
 the


highlights.
 Put
 it
 somewhere
 we
 see
 it


the
 whole
 time.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I'll
 put
 it
 I'll
 put
 it
 here


>> or
 under
 your
 mug
 or
 anywhere
 we
 never


lose
 sight
 of
 it.
 Wonderful.


>> I'll
 put
 my
 mug
 on
 top
 of
 it
 for
 anyone


that
 can't
 see
 cuz
 there
 will
 be
 some


people
 listening
 on
 audio.
 He's
 just


passed
 me
 a
 white
 piece
 of
 folded
 up


card
 and
 I've
 put
 it
 underneath
 my
 mug.


>> It's
 an
 offer.
 You
 can't
 refuse.


>> Listen
 guys,
 we're
 not
 colluding.
 So,


cuz
 I
 remember
 watching


I
 remember
 watching
 the
 Joe
 Rogan


episode
 and
 wondering
 whether
 you
 and


Joe
 Rogan
 had
 colluded.


>> Yep.


>> To
 like
 do
 the
 cuz
 it
 blew
 my
 mind.
 So,


my
 objective
 today
 is
 to
 be
 completely


honest
 with
 my
 audience.
 And
 also,
 if
 I


if
 I
 see
 you
 do
 something,
 do
 you
 want


me
 to
 say
 it?


>> For
 sure.


>> Okay.
 Do
 you
 actually
 want
 me
 to
 say
 it?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 so
 while
 I'm
 here.


>> Okay,
 fine.
 Okay.


>> I
 mean,
 they
 trust
 you.
 Why
 do
 people


listen
 to
 you?
 Great
 interview


questions,
 but
 they
 trust
 you.
 That's


how
 you
 build
 an
 audience.
 Yeah,
 I'd


feel
 bad
 if
 I
 if
 I
 duped
 them.
 And
 what


is
 it
 that
 you
 think
 you
 know
 that
 the


average
 person
 doesn't
 know
 about
 the


human
 condition?


>> I
 know
 how
 people
 think.
 So,
 I
 think


what
 I
 learned
 at
 a
 certain
 point
 were


skills
 that
 are
 for
 success
 in
 life.
 Let


me
 explain
 to
 you.
 The
 fear
 of
 rejection


is
 something
 that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 number


one
 factor
 between
 failure
 and
 success


is
 the
 fear.
 Most
 people
 don't
 try
 to


achieve
 their
 goals
 because
 they're


fearful
 of
 what
 will
 happen
 if
 they
 fail


or
 they
 set
 themselves
 up
 for
 failure


instead
 of
 for
 success.
 What
 do
 I
 mean


by
 that?
 When
 I
 was
 14,
 I'd
 walk
 up
 to
 a


restaurant.
 I
 talked
 my
 way
 into
 getting


a
 restaurant
 gig
 because
 I've
 been
 doing


magic
 trick
 tricks
 since
 I
 was
 13.
 And
 I


started
 learning
 by
 iterating
 what
 makes


people
 when
 I
 walk
 up
 to
 them


comfortable
 with
 me,
 what
 makes
 them


uncomfortable.
 I
 started
 learning
 how


people
 think.
 And
 it's
 down
 to
 the


smallest
 little
 nuances.
 I
 learned
 that


if
 I
 approach
 you
 directly,
 the
 same
 way


that
 animals
 fear
 you
 when
 they
 see
 two


eyes
 versus
 if
 I
 turn
 ever
 so
 slightly


and
 approach
 your
 table
 at
 an
 angle,
 you


only
 see
 one
 eye.
 We're
 hardwired
 from


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 years
 of


avoiding
 predators.
 That
 one
 eye
 is
 less


danger.
 Animals
 aren't
 as
 fearful
 of


you.
 So
 I
 walk
 up
 to
 you,
 I
 create
 time


limits.
 I
 learned
 quickly
 that
 if
 I
 walk


up,
 the
 first
 thing
 someone
 thinks
 is,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 is
 he
 going
 to
 be
 here


long?"
 The
 next
 thing
 is,
 "Do
 they
 even


know
 this
 kid's
 working
 here?
 Is
 he
 any


good
 at
 this?
 Oh
 god,
 I
 need
 money.
 Do
 I


have
 to
 tip
 him?
 I
 didn't
 bring
 cash.


All
 of
 these
 thoughts
 that
 go
 through


your
 minds.
 They're
 known
 as


heruristics.
 It's
 how
 we
 deal
 with
 our


life
 every
 day.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 know
 what


somebody's
 thinking,
 not
 to
 perform
 a


mentalist
 trick,
 but
 know
 what
 they're


thinking
 when
 they
 meet
 you
 or
 when
 you


ask
 your
 boss
 for
 a
 raise
 or
 when
 you


ask
 a
 girl
 or
 a
 guy
 out
 on
 a
 date,
 you


knowing
 that
 is
 a
 huge
 tactical


advantage.


>> And
 specifically,
 how
 would
 you
 do
 that?


What
 would
 you
 say?
 What
 I
 would
 say
 is


in
 my
 mind
 as
 a
 mentalist,
 what
 I
 do


most
 is
 prepare.
 I
 prepare
 in
 advance


for
 what
 will
 work,
 what
 won't
 work,
 and


all
 the
 troubleshoots
 in
 between.
 Plan


A,
 B,
 C,
 D,
 all
 the
 way
 to
 Z.
 So
 in
 that


situation,
 every
 time
 I
 learned


something
 new,
 I
 learned
 quickly
 that


people
 didn't
 know
 if
 I
 was
 working
 at


the
 restaurant.
 Am
 I
 just
 some
 kid
 who


walked
 up
 to
 you?
 Well,
 who
 is
 this?
 So


I
 walk
 at
 an
 angle
 so
 they
 know
 I
 might


be
 leaving
 soon.
 I'm
 one
 foot
 in,
 I'm


one
 foot
 out.
 I
 would
 then
 say
 to
 you,


did
 you
 hear
 what's
 going
 on
 tonight?


It's
 your
 lucky
 day.
 Right
 away,
 that's


a
 different
 thing.
 That's
 a
 dopamine


hit.
 That's
 the
 same
 way
 when
 your
 phone


buzzes.
 That's
 why
 we're
 hooked.
 Who


texted
 me?
 What
 does
 this
 say?
 Is
 this
 a


like?
 Is
 this
 a
 comment?
 That's
 that


lottery.
 By
 me
 saying
 to
 you
 a
 question


that
 denotes
 positive
 energy
 without
 a


yes
 or
 no.
 You
 don't
 have
 a
 way
 to
 stop


me.
 If
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 do
 you
 want to
 see


me
 do
 magic?"
 No.
 Get
 out
 of
 here.
 Boom.


We're
 done.
 Asking
 people
 questions
 that


are
 open-ended,
 that
 are
 inherently


positive,
 almost
 always
 generates
 a


great
 response.
 Did
 you
 hear
 why
 it's


your
 lucky
 night?
 Oh,
 why
 is
 it
 my
 lucky


night?
 And
 I
 say,
 "The
 owner
 brought
 me


in
 as
 a
 special
 treat
 to
 do
 something


amazing
 for
 you."
 So
 now
 listen
 to
 this.


The
 owner,
 they
 know
 I'm
 working
 there.


The
 owner
 brought
 me
 in.
 I
 know
 the


owner.
 Social
 value,
 social
 currency,
 as


a
 special
 treat.
 That
 means
 you
 don't


need
 to
 pay
 me
 money.
 They've
 paid
 the


bill.
 Amazing.
 And
 then
 to
 show
 you


something
 amazing.
 So
 I've
 given
 you
 no


point
 at
 which
 to
 say
 no.
 I've
 given
 you


very
 few
 angles
 to
 think
 anything
 but


positive.
 And
 I've
 done
 this
 all
 in


hopefully
 less
 than
 10
 seconds.
 That's


the
 intro.
 Now,
 you
 better
 have
 your


agame.
 I
 better
 have
 a
 trick
 that's


going
 to
 blow
 them
 away
 and
 capture


their
 attention.


>> So,
 let's
 just
 pause
 there
 for
 a
 second


because
 I
 think
 everybody,
 whether


you're
 a
 content
 creator
 or
 you're


working
 in
 sales
 or
 you're
 interviewing


people
 um
 to
 join
 your
 company,
 what
 I


what
 I
 heard
 there
 was
 you
 you
 created


this
 like
 positive


curiosity
 gap.


>> Yes.


>> Where
 immediately
 and
 that's
 also
 what


Mr.
 Beast
 does
 at
 the
 start
 of
 his


videos.
 He


>> the
 hook
 instantly.


>> Yeah.
 I
 hate
 it's
 like
 a
 positive


curiosity
 gap
 where
 you
 you
 need
 that


gap
 closed.
 And
 you
 said
 in
 that
 case,


>> they
 brought
 me
 in.
 Have
 you
 heard


what's
 happening
 tonight?


>> Yep.


>> It's
 amazing.
 You've
 brought
 me
 in
 as
 a


treat
 to
 do
 something
 amazing.


Immediately
 I
 need
 to
 know
 what
 this
 is.


>> What
 is
 this?


>> And
 I
 don't
 want
 you
 to
 leave.
 And
 then


you'd
 blow
 them
 away
 somehow.


>> I'd
 blow
 them
 away.
 But
 the
 lessons
 to


be
 learned
 from
 there
 are
 things
 that


I've
 used
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life.
 And


they
 apply
 so
 much
 to
 today's
 day
 and


age
 where
 what
 is
 the
 currency
 of
 our


time?
 Attention.
 This
 very
 moment
 that


someone's
 listening
 and
 watching
 is
 can


allow
 you
 to
 blow
 up
 a
 business.
 We
 have


never
 been
 in
 an
 era
 where
 your
 phone


having
 a
 phone
 can
 allow
 you
 to
 become
 a


global
 superstar
 to
 launch
 a
 business.


It's
 it's
 like
 100
 years
 ago
 this
 didn't


exist
 this
 option.
 So
 knowing
 how
 to


connect
 with
 people
 on
 an
 emotional


level
 and
 then
 knowing
 what
 does
 your


audience
 want.
 That's
 what
 I
 learned


early
 on.
 I'm
 just
 knowing
 how
 people


think
 and
 using
 that
 to
 entertain
 them.


>> And
 how
 much
 of
 it
 is
 based
 on
 my
 body


language?
 How
 much
 of
 it
 of
 it
 is
 based


on
 how
 I
 behave?
 Um,
 and
 I
 say
 that


because
 the
 audience,
 you
 know,
 that


they're
 all
 professionals
 working
 in


their
 careers
 and
 they're
 very
 keen
 to


better
 understand
 people
 through


observation.


>> Sure.


>> Whether
 it's
 their
 team
 members
 or


whether
 it's
 clients
 or
 whoever
 it
 might


be.
 So,
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 there's


anything
 I
 can
 learn
 to
 be
 a
 better


observer
 of
 the
 people
 in
 my
 life.


>> Absolutely.
 So,
 for
 my
 performances,


let's
 break
 this
 down.
 I
 I'm
 an


entertainer.
 That's
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a


living.
 And
 now,
 after
 many
 years,


people
 ask
 me,
 "How
 do
 you
 do
 it?
 How
 do


you
 do it?"
 I've
 realized
 you
 don't
 want


to
 know
 how
 I
 do
 it.
 You
 don't
 really.


If
 I
 were
 to
 guess,
 let's
 do
 something


fun.
 You
 have
 a
 deck
 of
 cards.
 Yeah.


Let's
 just
 sweeten
 the
 deal.
 These
 are


your
 cards,
 correct?
 This
 is
 not
 I've


not
 touched
 these.
 There's
 no
 magic


trick
 involved.


>> These
 are
 all
 cards.
 Yes.


>> Here's
 what
 I'd
 like
 to
 try
 for
 you.
 Put


them
 down
 in
 front
 of
 you,
 please.


>> You've
 mixed
 them
 up.
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 mix


them
 some
 more?


>> Yes,
 I
 do.


>> Please
 mix
 them
 as
 much
 as
 you'd
 like.


>> Just
 say
 that
 cuz
 I
 just
 saw


>> No,
 don't
 say
 a
 word.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


>> The
 moment
 I
 touch
 those
 cards,
 my
 brain


flips
 a
 switch
 and
 goes,
 "This
 is
 a


magic
 trick.
 That's
 what
 I
 know.
 Oh,
 I


know
 that
 archetype.
 I'm
 not
 touching


those
 cards.
 I
 couldn't
 care
 less
 about


those
 cards.
 Imagine
 that
 in
 front
 of


you
 instead
 was
 an
 invisible
 pack
 of


cards.
 Stephen,
 this
 is
 where
 I
 changed


gears
 where
 years
 ago
 I
 spent
 hours
 and


hours
 learning
 slight
 of
 hand.
 Pick
 up


the
 invisible
 deck,
 please.
 Just


pretend.
 Just
 like
 that.
 And
 I
 want
 you


to
 spread
 them
 out
 in
 front
 of
 you
 face


down.
 You
 can't
 see
 them.
 And
 Stephen,


you
 close
 your
 eyes.
 You
 reach
 down.
 And


here's
 the
 part
 where
 we
 can't
 collude


because
 they're
 invisible
 and
 you
 don't


know
 what
 you're
 about
 to
 do,
 much
 less


me.
 And
 I
 want
 you
 to
 reach
 down
 and


imagine
 you
 just
 grab
 a
 card
 at
 random,


face
 down.
 Do
 it
 for
 me
 now,
 please.
 And


stop
 right
 there.
 Freeze.
 Have
 I
 told


you
 what
 to
 do
 at
 this
 moment?
 Have
 I


said
 anything?
 Is
 there
 any
 way
 that
 you


could
 know
 what
 card
 you
 just
 picked
 in


your
 hand
 or
 I
 could
 know
 or
 any
 of


this?


>> No.


>> No.
 This
 is
 spontaneous,
 impulsive,
 and


in
 the
 moment.
 It's
 the
 gold
 standard


for
 what
 I
 do.
 Don't
 say
 a
 word.
 Look
 at


it.
 Look
 at
 me.
 Just
 think.
 The
 cards


are
 red.
 They're
 black.
 There's
 the


hearts,
 the
 diamonds,
 the
 clubs,
 and
 the


spades.
 There's
 the
 number
 cards.


There's
 the
 big
 cards.
 Ace
 2,
 3,
 4,
 5,


6,
 7,
 9,
 10,
 Jack,
 queen,
 king.
 Close


your
 eyes.
 That's
 it.
 I'm
 going
 to
 take


these
 cards
 that
 are
 next
 to
 you.
 Oop,


sorry.
 And
 I'd
 like
 you
 to
 keep
 your


eyes
 closed
 if
 you
 don't
 mind.
 And
 this


is
 not
 a
 card
 trick,
 but
 I
 want
 a
 visual


for
 your
 audience.
 Hold
 your
 hand
 out,


please.
 And
 hold
 it
 as
 if
 you
 were


holding
 one
 card
 in
 your
 hand.
 Keep
 your


eyes
 closed.
 Do
 not
 open
 them.
 I'm
 gonna


place
 one
 card
 in
 your
 hand.
 Close
 your


fingers
 and
 freeze
 right
 there.
 Before


you
 open
 your
 eyes,
 tell
 us
 what
 was


that
 card.


>> The


three
 of
 diamonds.


>> Open
 your
 eyes.
 Take
 a
 look.


>> It's
 very
 It
 is
 very
 very
 difficult
 for


me
 to
 understand
 how
 you
 do
 that.
 Now,


here's
 the
 question.
 So,
 I
 tell
 you


this.
 If
 I
 were
 to
 teach
 you
 that
 you


could
 do
 it,
 it
 would
 take
 you
 quite


some
 time
 and
 you'll
 learn.
 And
 it
 was
 a


narrowing
 down
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 options
 into


one,
 which
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 I
 do.
 I


limit
 your
 options
 and
 I
 read
 what
 you


are
 giving
 off
 because
 there's
 no
 magic


trick.
 There's
 no
 slight
 of
 hand


involved
 in
 this.
 Are
 we
 in
 agreement?


This
 is
 an
 invisible
 deck.
 You
 took
 out


a
 card.
 Let's
 put
 these
 away.
 But
 here's


where
 I
 would
 say
 what's
 applicable
 is


knowing
 how
 to
 read
 people
 more


effectively
 in
 your
 life.
 Not
 for
 the


sake
 of
 a
 trick,
 but
 knowing
 what


they're
 actually
 thinking.
 Now,
 if


you're
 watching
 this
 and
 you
 said
 you're


a
 business
 person,
 you
 want
 a
 tangible


takeaway
 for
 body
 language.
 You
 ask


yourself,
 was
 there
 a
 body
 language


thing?
 Was
 there
 something
 that
 you
 did


specifically?
 Was
 there
 a
 flex
 of
 an


arm?
 Was
 there
 a
 twinge
 of
 an
 eyebrow?


Was
 there
 something
 that
 you
 can
 see?


There
 are
 definitely
 markers.
 But
 what
 I


would
 describe
 to
 people
 is
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people,
 they
 want
 to
 know
 a
 core
 thing.


Is
 someone
 interested?
 Yes
 or
 no?
 And
 is


someone
 lying?
 Yes
 or
 no?
 If
 you
 could


know
 those
 two
 things,
 I
 think
 that


opens
 up
 a
 world
 of
 possibilities.
 How


many
 major
 moments
 of
 your
 life
 had
 to


do
 with
 if
 somebody
 liked
 or
 was


interested
 in
 what
 you
 were
 doing,
 be
 it


in
 sales
 or
 business
 or
 or
 per
 personal


or
 if
 somebody
 was
 telling
 you
 the
 truth


or
 lying?
 The
 best
 way
 to
 learn
 if


somebody's
 lying
 to
 you
 is
 learning


their
 benchmarks.
 Let
 me
 explain
 to
 you


what
 that
 means.
 Meeting
 somebody
 one


time,
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 know
 things


about
 them.
 One-time
 transactions,
 you


can't
 really
 gauge
 who
 they
 are
 as
 a


person.
 But
 how
 many
 people
 in
 your
 life


do
 you
 meet
 once?
 Few
 most
 of the
 people


you
 meet
 you
 meet
 often.
 So
 a
 lie


detector
 machine,
 have
 you
 ever
 been
 lie


detector
 machined?


>> Never.


>> So
 the
 way
 they
 work
 is
 they
 have
 to
 ask


you
 questions
 beforehand
 to
 set
 your


your
 your
 benchmarks.
 They
 have
 to
 check


and
 they
 see
 tell
 me
 an
 honest
 answer.


Is
 your
 name
 Steven
 Bartlett?
 Yes.
 They


look
 at
 your
 indicators
 to
 see
 what


honesty
 looks
 like.
 And
 then
 they
 look


to
 see
 tell
 me
 a
 lie.
 And
 now
 they
 try


to
 compare
 the
 two
 to
 each
 other.
 So,


what
 I
 do
 when
 I
 watch
 people
 and


observe
 is
 I
 try
 to
 see
 what
 do
 they


look
 like
 when
 they're
 telling
 me
 the


truth.
 And
 these
 are
 fun
 things
 you


could
 try
 at
 home.
 See
 when
 somebody


tells
 you
 a
 story,
 how
 many
 details
 do


they
 insert?
 What's
 their
 cadence,


right?
 How
 do
 they
 speak?
 You
 can
 tell


when
 people
 are
 lying
 more
 often
 than


not
 if
 you
 observe
 them
 often.
 You
 can


see
 it.
 Do
 they
 add
 more
 details?
 So
 you


can
 try
 to
 find
 fun
 ways
 that
 seem
 to
 be


white
 lies
 to
 see
 what
 do
 they
 do
 when


they
 lie
 versus
 what
 do
 they
 do
 when


they
 tell
 the
 truth
 and
 then
 start
 to


trust
 your
 instincts
 more.
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 things
 that
 I
 do
 I've
 unlearned
 bad


habits.
 I
 think
 that
 when
 we
 were


growing
 up
 most
 of
 us
 had
 much
 better
 BS


detection
 systems.
 When
 you're
 2,
 three,


four,
 you
 know
 if
 your
 siblings
 lying
 to


you.
 You
 know
 if
 people
 are
 lying
 to
 you


very
 well.
 you're
 kind
 of
 very
 young
 and


there's
 an
 instinct
 involved
 that
 I


think
 is
 akin
 to
 when
 I
 play
 ping
 pong.


I
 can't
 think
 about
 my
 shot.
 I
 just
 do


the
 shot.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I
 did
 it.
 My


body
 just
 goes
 into
 motion.
 So
 when
 I'm


performing,
 I
 am
 the
 way
 people
 always


ask
 me,
 are
 you
 doing
 this
 in
 every


moment
 of
 your
 life?
 No.
 It's
 tiring.


I'm
 focused,
 hyperfocused
 on
 what
 you're


doing
 and
 the
 things
 that
 I'm
 watching


that
 will
 give
 away
 certain
 elements.


And
 I'm
 influencing
 you.
 there's


misdirection
 and
 I'm
 guiding
 you
 in
 a


certain
 position
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 to


what
 I
 want
 you
 to
 select.


>> Say
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 sell
 you
 something.


>> Sure.
 I'm
 I'm
 we're
 doing
 a


presentation.
 I'm
 a
 marketing
 agency


owner
 owner
 and
 I
 would
 like
 you
 to
 buy


this
 marketing
 campaign
 from
 me
 um


instead
 of
 this
 one
 or
 no
 campaign.


>> Sure.
 So,
 what
 are
 some
 things
 you
 could


tell
 me
 that
 I
 should
 be
 thinking
 about


or
 doing
 if
 I'm
 selling
 to
 you
 to
 make


you
 buy
 what
 I
 would
 like
 you
 to
 buy?


>> Number
 one
 rule,
 I
 call
 this
 channeling


your
 inner
 mentalist.
 It's
 not
 about


you.
 It's
 always
 about
 them.
 That's
 been


the
 number
 one
 secret
 to
 my
 success.
 I


shouldn't
 have
 been
 I've
 been
 on
 all


different
 networks
 doing
 what
 I
 do
 on


CNBC.
 I've
 been
 on
 there
 dozens
 of


times.
 That's
 the
 financial
 network.
 How


many
 other
 magicians
 or
 mentalists
 have


ever
 been
 on
 that
 network?
 zero.
 It


doesn't
 make
 sense.
 That's
 a
 serious


network.
 They
 do
 finance.
 Why
 are
 they


bringing
 me
 on?
 Because
 I
 tailor
 my


presentations
 to
 the
 viewer.
 I
 don't


think
 about
 myself.
 A
 card
 trick
 is


about
 me.
 Me
 doing
 something
 related
 to


stocks
 and
 bonds
 and
 and
 dividends
 and


interest
 rates.
 That
 is
 fascinating
 the


person
 watching.
 The
 same
 way
 if
 I
 go


into
 a
 room
 with
 football
 players,
 I


make
 everything
 structured
 on
 football.


So
 I
 challenge
 you
 that
 when
 you
 make
 a


presentation
 like
 that,
 are
 you
 just


thinking
 about
 you
 or
 where
 can
 you


highlight
 the
 attributes
 of
 what
 is
 this


person
 missing?
 What's
 wrong
 with
 what


their
 status
 quo
 is?
 What
 are
 you


missing?
 Listen
 to
 your
 listen
 to
 your


consumer.
 Listen
 to
 your
 client.
 Listen


to
 your
 audience.
 They
 will
 tell
 you.


They
 will
 give
 you
 the
 answers
 to
 what


you
 need
 to
 give
 back
 to
 them.
 So
 many


people
 when
 they
 approach
 someone
 else,


they
 approach
 with
 the
 following.
 How


great
 am
 I?
 How
 great
 is
 my
 product?
 Bum


bum
 bum.
 It's
 all
 about
 me,
 me,
 me.
 This


needs
 to
 be
 benefitsoriented
 language.


All
 of
 it
 should
 be
 you.
 I
 want
 to
 make


your
 life
 easier.
 I
 want
 to
 make
 this


migration
 to
 our
 platform
 seamless.


What's
 currently
 bothering
 you?
 I
 want


to
 know
 all
 the
 things
 that
 you
 that
 are


your
 moments
 of
 resistance.
 What's


resisting
 you
 from
 saying
 yes?
 And
 every


time
 you
 tell
 me
 one,
 I
 want
 to
 be


prepared
 to
 check
 that
 off.
 That's
 so


funny
 you
 mentioned
 that.
 It's
 I
 know


you
 want
 no
 downtime.
 Here's
 how
 we
 can


ensure
 no
 downtime.
 Right?
 You
 want
 to


anticipate
 what
 they're
 going
 to
 say
 the


same
 way
 a
 mentalist
 does.
 But
 in
 this


case,
 you're
 not
 guessing
 cards
 or


numbers
 or
 names.
 You're
 guessing
 the


thoughts
 of
 what's
 keeping
 them
 from


buying
 your
 product.


>> And
 is
 that
 a
 practice
 per
 se?
 Would
 you


like
 if
 this
 was,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 was


pitching
 to
 you
 and
 you're
 the
 CEO
 of


Uber
 Y


>> and
 I
 want
 you
 to
 work
 with
 my
 agency.


Before
 I
 go
 into
 that
 meeting,
 you
 know,


you
 talked
 about
 preparation
 earlier
 on,


do
 you
 write
 down
 or
 just
 think
 about


the
 rebuttals
 or
 the
 person
 that
 you're


you're
 contending
 with
 and
 then
 try
 and


tailor
 the
 presentation
 to
 a
 set
 of
 sort


of
 ideological
 ego
 factors
 that
 that


that
 you
 believe
 that
 person's
 coming


into
 the
 room
 with.


>> Right?
 So
 I
 write
 down
 everything.


Literally
 at
 one
 chapter
 in
 that
 book
 is


all
 about
 how
 taking
 notes
 has
 changed


my
 life.
 So
 at
 every
 show
 and
 through


every
 interaction
 that
 I
 ever
 have
 with


somebody,
 I
 write
 down
 I
 had
 a
 show
 last


night,
 a
 show
 the
 night
 before.
 I
 will


write
 down
 I
 have
 a
 shortorthhand
 to


make
 it
 quicker,
 but
 I
 will
 write
 down


everything
 that
 I
 did,
 everybody
 that
 I


met,
 things
 that
 I
 remember
 about
 them.


And
 I
 will
 do
 this
 immediately
 when
 I


finish
 the
 show.
 If
 I
 might
 have
 a
 meet


and
 greet
 in
 photos,
 the
 moment
 it's


done,
 you'll
 sometimes
 see
 me
 in
 an
 Uber


in
 my
 hotel
 and
 I'm
 writing
 furiously


everything
 while
 it's
 still
 in
 my
 mind


and
 fresh
 because
 information
 is
 power.


And
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 that
 people


care
 about
 is
 themselves,
 their
 family,


their
 friends,
 their
 career,
 right?
 All


of
 us
 are
 the
 star
 of
 our
 own
 movie.


You're
 the
 star
 of
 your
 movie.
 I'm
 the


star
 of
 my
 movie.
 Right
 here,
 the


person,
 man,
 the
 camera
 is
 star.


Everybody
 else
 is
 supporting
 cast.
 So,


think
 of
 it
 this
 way.
 If
 you
 can


remember
 things
 about
 that
 person,
 not


creepy.
 What
 if
 they
 told
 you
 something?


Last
 night
 I
 met
 somebody.
 She
 has
 two


children.
 They're
 three
 and
 five.
 Her


oldest
 son
 absolutely
 loves
 this
 one


YouTube
 star.
 They
 live
 I
 know
 where


they
 live.
 Like
 she
 just
 shared
 a
 lot
 of


details
 with
 me
 that
 in
 her
 mind
 are


kind
 of
 like
 Snapchats.
 They
 vanished.


They
 didn't
 vanish
 to
 me.
 So
 now
 that


I've
 written
 those
 down,
 I
 might
 see
 her


in
 a
 month,
 in
 a
 year,
 in
 a
 decade.
 Do


you
 know
 how
 great
 that
 feeling
 is
 to


somebody
 when
 you
 remember
 things
 they


told
 you?
 It's
 like
 winning
 the
 lottery.


It's
 literally
 like
 you
 get
 to
 do
 a


magic
 trick
 like
 I
 do,
 but
 people
 give


you
 credit.
 I
 will
 remember
 at
 shows
 who


hired
 me
 for
 the
 show.
 Oh,
 they
 know


this
 person
 now.
 We
 have
 a
 chain.
 We


have
 a
 referral
 link.
 I
 might
 see
 them


again.
 I
 guessed
 their
 ATM
 pin
 code


three
 years
 ago.
 It
 was
 6124.
 I
 now
 know


that.
 I
 bump
 into
 them
 there
 and
 I
 don't


have
 a
 supernatural
 memory.
 Another
 part


of
 the
 book
 is
 how
 to
 improve
 your


memory,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 also
 a
 huge


secret
 to
 success
 in
 life
 that
 people


don't
 realize.
 We
 have
 phones
 now.
 We


think
 our
 phone
 does
 it
 for
 us.
 That's


not
 true.
 And
 I
 say
 to
 him,
 I
 go,
 "John,


I
 sure
 hope
 you
 change
 that
 pin
 code


from
 6124."
 He
 is
 blown
 away.
 Stephen,


do
 you
 understand?
 That's
 not
 a
 trick.
 I


wrote
 it
 down.
 There's
 no
 I'll
 tell
 you


exactly
 how
 I
 did
 it.
 All
 I
 did
 was
 take


the
 time
 to
 review
 it
 before
 I
 got
 there


and
 made
 him
 feel
 special.
 And
 do
 you


know
 what
 he's
 going to
 do?
 He's
 going


to
 talk
 about
 that
 moment
 for
 years
 to


come.
 I've
 created
 a
 memory.
 If
 you
 can


create
 memorable
 moments
 for
 others,


they
 will
 remember
 you
 and
 they
 will


spread
 the
 word
 to
 others.
 And
 that's


how
 you
 whatever
 you
 do
 in
 life.
 What


you
 do
 for
 others
 is
 what's
 going
 to


eventually
 propel
 you
 to
 success.
 I


would
 say
 give
 gratuitously.
 But
 the


more
 gratuitous
 you
 give,
 there's
 this


funny
 way
 in
 the
 world
 where
 the


universe
 bounces
 back
 and
 the
 more
 I
 do


for
 others,
 they
 want
 to
 do
 the
 same
 for


me.


>> If
 you
 were
 to
 make
 that
 really


practical
 for
 me.
 So
 you
 have
 a


shorthand
 book
 which
 you
 write
 in
 every


time
 you
 meet
 someone
 to
 keep
 details.


>> You
 can
 do it
 in
 your
 phone.
 I
 do
 in
 my


phone.
 So
 I
 have
 calendar
 entries.
 Let's


be
 very
 clear.
 Let's
 give
 you
 brass
 tax.


I
 will
 write
 in
 I
 if
 you
 look
 at
 my


phone
 right
 now,
 the
 event
 last
 night


set
 list.
 I
 wrote
 down
 the
 name
 of
 the


host,
 his
 wife.
 They
 have
 three


children.
 They
 have
 twins.
 Like


everything
 about
 this
 is
 very
 fresh
 in


my
 mind
 and
 I'll
 remember
 it
 for
 a
 day


but
 then
 it
 will
 kind
 of
 it
 will


dissipate.
 Which
 tricks
 did
 I
 do?
 What


happened
 in
 the
 tricks?
 What
 were
 funny


moments
 that
 were
 off
 the
 cuff?
 Who
 did


I
 meet
 earlier
 that
 day?
 I
 met
 somebody


and
 again
 I'm
 writing
 all
 this
 stuff


down
 because
 that
 information
 is
 power.


That
 information
 the
 longer
 you
 hold
 it


it's
 a
 coupon
 with
 no
 expiration
 date.


And
 when
 you
 serve
 it
 up
 to
 that
 person


in
 fact
 it's
 the
 reverse.
 The
 longer
 you


hold
 on
 to
 it
 the
 more
 impressive
 it
 is.


>> If
 I
 met
 you
 yesterday
 and
 you
 told
 me


your
 favorite
 color
 is
 magenta
 and
 I
 say


it
 to
 you
 tomorrow.
 Not
 that
 exciting.


But
 in
 two
 years
 if
 when
 I
 meet
 you
 and


we
 see
 a
 car
 I
 go
 Stephen
 that's
 your


favorite
 color
 magenta
 isn't
 it?
 Not
 as


a
 trick,
 just
 there
 in
 your
 mind.


Dopamine.
 How
 did
 you
 remember
 that?


You're
 touched
 that
 I
 remember
 that


about
 you,
 right?
 That's
 what
 people


care
 about.
 People
 think
 about
 again


their
 family,
 their
 friends,
 their


faith,
 their
 business,
 all
 of
 that.
 The


more
 that
 you
 can
 make
 someone
 else


shine,
 the
 better
 it
 happens
 to
 you.


Everything
 is
 about
 when
 I
 my
 whole
 act


is
 geared
 towards
 making
 other
 people


look
 good.
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 this
 um


quite
 a
 lot
 and
 I
 actually
 posted
 on
 my


LinkedIn
 this
 morning
 about
 the
 paradox


of
 small
 things
 um
 and
 what
 I
 said
 in


the
 post
 it's
 reflecting
 on
 Jimmy


Fallon.
 I
 was
 on
 his
 show
 this
 week
 and


he
 mentioned
 that
 we
 have
 this
 tradition


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 podcast
 with
 the


guests.
 It's
 a
 small
 thing
 that
 we
 do
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 show.
 And
 the
 fact
 that


he
 remembered
 it
 and
 told
 his
 audience


about
 it
 and
 he
 said
 he
 brought
 him
 to


tears
 made
 me
 realize
 that
 actually
 the


small
 things
 in
 life
 um
 that
 we
 often


overlook
 like
 remembering
 someone's
 name


or
 and
 as
 you
 said
 their
 family
 or
 some


sort
 of
 intricate
 personal
 detail,


they're
 so
 powerful
 because
 most
 people


don't
 think
 they
 matter.


>> That's
 it.
 So
 when
 one
 person
 in
 your


life
 remembers
 a
 tiny
 detail
 about
 you


that
 kind
 of
 matters
 to
 you,
 even
 your


name
 is
 something
 that
 matters
 to
 you,


it's
 so
 shockingly
 rare
 that
 it's
 so


shockingly
 powerful
 because
 most
 people


think
 it's
 so
 unbelievably
 petty.


>> And
 this
 is
 the
 I
 think
 the
 paradox
 of


small
 things
 that
 they're
 actually
 in


fact
 really
 big
 things.
 Well,
 think


about
 how
 many
 small
 things
 if
 you
 were


to
 look
 at
 your
 life
 and
 just
 have
 these


little
 roads,
 these
 like
 fork
 in
 the


road
 where
 one
 path
 led
 to
 this
 and
 I


have
 those
 moments
 where
 in
 my
 life


where
 somebody
 said
 one
 thing
 to
 me


sometimes
 off-handed
 they
 don't
 even


remember
 it
 and
 it
 changed
 the
 course
 of


my
 life
 and
 there's
 like
 little
 moments


I
 had
 one
 so
 I
 worked
 on
 Wall
 Street.
 I


didn't
 think
 that
 you
 could
 be
 a


magician
 or
 mentalist.
 It's
 crazy
 that


it
 never
 even
 occurred
 to
 me
 as
 an


option.
 But
 at
 one
 point
 I
 had
 I
 there's


two
 moments,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 is


I'm
 doing
 something
 for
 the
 CFO
 of
 my


company,
 Meil
 Lynch.
 He
 does
 not
 know


that
 I
 work
 for
 the
 company.
 And
 I
 used


to
 do
 this
 magic
 trick
 with
 slight
 of


hand
 where
 I
 take
 five
 $1
 bills.
 I
 hold


them,
 I
 snap,
 they
 turn
 to
 hundreds.


It's
 amazing.
 It's
 it's
 a
 great
 trick.


And
 at
 that
 moment,
 he's
 an
 Australian


guy.
 And
 he
 goes
 he
 goes
 he
 goes,
 "We


need
 you
 working
 here,
 mate."
 And


everyone
 laughs.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


it's
 a
 joke
 I've
 heard
 a hundred
 times,


a
 thousand
 times.
 And
 I
 go,
 "It's
 funny,


sir.
 I
 do
 work
 here."
 and
 he
 thought
 it


was
 a
 joke.
 I
 broke
 character
 a
 little.


I
 go,
 "No,
 no,
 seriously.
 I
 work
 at
 95


Green
 uh
 at
 your
 global
 technology


services
 department."
 And
 he
 looked
 at


me,
 he
 goes,
 "What
 are
 you
 doing
 working


here?"
 And
 that
 moment
 to
 him,
 I
 assume


was
 nothing.
 It
 was
 forgotten
 moments


later.
 But
 that
 moment
 changed
 the


course
 of
 my
 life
 because
 there
 was
 like


a
 switch
 in
 my
 mind
 that
 was
 what
 am
 I


doing
 working
 here?
 You
 know,
 where
 you


kind
 of
 like
 can
 visualize
 your
 future?


Is
 this
 my
 path?
 Is
 this
 what
 I'm
 going


to
 do
 forever?
 Or
 am
 I
 going
 to
 decide


that
 you
 live
 one
 life
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 for
 it?
 And
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 listening
 to
 this,
 I'm


not
 saying
 to
 quit
 your
 job,
 but
 you
 ask


yourself,
 look
 in
 the
 mirror,
 is
 this


what
 I
 want
 to
 be
 doing?
 And
 I
 think
 for


a
 lot
 of
 people,
 they
 might
 want
 more.


Whether
 that's
 their
 own
 business,


whether
 it's
 to
 climb
 the
 rung
 of
 a


ladder.
 And
 it's
 that
 moment
 that


somebody
 can
 change
 your
 life
 and
 take


action
 and
 decide,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it,


but
 also
 formulate
 a
 plan,
 be
 effective


and
 smart
 in
 your
 execution.


>> And
 in
 your
 case,
 you
 know,
 leaving


Maril
 Lynch
 to
 go
 and
 become
 a
 mentalist


is
 quite
 quite
 a
 leap.
 I
 remember


>> huge
 leap.
 Everyone
 thought
 I
 was
 crazy.


Same
 with
 Darren
 Brown.


>> No
 one
 said
 to
 me,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 great


idea."
 Even
 though
 I've
 got
 to
 tell
 you


the
 truth,
 most
 people
 were
 very
 happy


for
 me.
 But
 behind
 closed
 doors,
 I
 think


they
 thought
 this
 kid,
 you
 know,
 he's


nuts.


>> You
 kind
 of
 were
 nuts
 because


statistically,
 probabilistically,
 the


chance
 of
 you
 becoming


a
 quote
 unquote
 successful
 mentalist
 is


extremely
 low.


>> Extremely
 low.


>> But
 I
 mean,
 like
 there's
 there's


probably
 like
 a
 handful
 of
 mentalists


that
 earn
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


>> I
 would
 say
 it's
 a
 very
 low
 number.
 But


here's
 the
 question
 you
 should
 ask


yourself.
 Why
 not
 you?
 That
 like
 the


framing
 of
 that
 is
 always
 of
 course


there's
 statistics
 but
 why
 not
 me?
 And


so
 I
 think
 the
 way
 you
 think
 in
 your


mind,
 the
 voice
 in
 your
 head
 that
 tells


you
 that
 loop
 determines
 things.
 So
 it's


all
 about
 setting
 yourself
 up
 for


success
 rather
 than
 failure.


>> How
 much
 of
 being
 a
 mentalist
 is


understanding
 human
 behavior
 versus


>> everything?
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to


answer.
 It's
 literally
 that's
 that's
 I'm


a
 student
 of
 the
 human
 like
 how
 people


behave.
 But
 the
 practice
 of
 it,
 because


Darren
 Brown
 is
 um
 I
 consider
 him
 a


friend.
 And
 if
 I've
 learned
 anything


from
 him,
 and
 I
 do
 think
 he's
 the
 most


incredible
 person
 on
 and
 off
 camera,


it's
 that
 much
 of
 his
 work
 is
 making
 you


think
 the
 trick
 is
 happening
 here.


>> 100%.


>> But
 actually,
 the
 trick
 is
 happening


happening
 over
 here.
 And
 he's


misdirecting
 you
 to
 focus
 on
 my
 left


hand
 and
 the
 trick
 is
 taking
 place
 in
 my


right
 hand.


>> That's
 that
 couldn't
 be
 more
 true.


That's
 exactly
 it.
 But
 that's
 that
 is


knowing
 human
 behavior.


>> Explain
 to
 me
 why.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say


controlling
 because
 it
 sounds
 very


devious,
 but
 I'm
 controlling
 your


attention
 and
 your
 thoughts.
 I'm
 guiding


you
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 to
 either
 select


what
 I'd
 like
 or
 to
 give
 away
 something


that
 you
 feel
 you
 have
 not
 given
 away.


Should
 we
 should
 we
 do
 a
 fun
 example?


>> Sure.


>> Do
 you
 know
 off
 the
 top
 of
 your
 head
 how


many
 episodes
 you've
 had
 of
 this
 show?


>> I
 think
 it's
 roughly
 500,


>> I
 believe.
 So,
 close
 your
 eyes.
 I
 want


to
 make
 this
 a
 visual
 game.
 You're
 in


this
 room
 of
 all
 different
 people
 that


you've
 looked
 at,
 you've
 seen,
 that
 you


respect,
 okay?
 Some
 of
 them
 could
 have


been
 guests
 on
 the
 show


>> and
 then
 you
 get
 a
 tap
 on
 the
 shoulder.


You
 turn
 around,
 you
 look
 at
 this


person,
 and
 it's
 somebody
 you've
 met


before,
 100%.


And
 they
 say
 something
 to
 you.
 They've


said
 it
 to
 you
 before,
 and
 you
 get
 deja


vu,
 and
 it's
 something
 impactful.
 It


left
 an
 impression
 on
 you.
 Is
 that
 a


fair
 assessment?


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 inherently
 right
 there,


boom,
 that
 makes
 you
 think
 of
 another


person.
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 I
 don't


think
 they
 mentioned
 this
 other
 person,


but
 something
 about
 that
 takeaway
 or


that
 that
 thought
 or
 that
 moment
 of


clarity
 or
 wisdom
 made
 you
 think
 of


someone
 else
 in
 your
 life.
 It
 was


connected
 to
 them.
 This
 next
 person,


person
 number
 two,
 I'm
 calling.
 They


jumped
 over,
 open
 your
 eyes.
 When
 was


the
 last
 time
 you
 had
 spoken
 to
 that


person?


>> The
 person
 number
 two.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,


today.


>> Today.
 Okay.
 Let's
 let's
 lean
 into
 this.


Think
 of
 their
 first
 name.
 Count
 the


letters
 to
 yourself.


Don't
 say
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 somebody
 you
 know
 well,
 you've


spoken
 to
 them
 today.
 I
 watched
 your


eyes.
 You
 went
 up
 up
 up
 up.


Five
 letters,
 isn't
 it?


>> Yeah.


>> You
 asked
 me
 how
 I
 do it.
 You
 said,
 "Do


I
 study
 people?"
 You
 just
 gave
 it
 away


yourself.


There's
 five
 letters
 to
 choose
 from.


There's
 26
 in
 the
 alphabet.
 Pick
 any


letter
 in
 this
 person's
 first
 name.
 Mix


them
 up
 a
 little.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 you
 grab
 one
 out
 and
 you
 just


decide
 this
 is
 the
 letter
 I
 want
 to


focus
 on.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 knowing
 you,
 Knowing
 you
 as
 an


entrepreneur,
 knowing
 you,
 the
 way
 you


give
 interviews,
 I
 think
 I
 know
 what
 you


would
 want
 to
 do
 knowing
 that
 you
 know


Darren
 Brown.
 You
 know
 how
 some
 of
 this


works.
 So,
 your
 instinct
 was
 to
 go


against
 your
 instinct
 because
 you
 I
 know


this
 would
 be
 obvious.
 You
 didn't
 think


of
 the
 first
 letter,
 did
 you?


>> No.


>> You
 didn't
 want
 to.
 You
 thought
 that


would
 give
 it
 away.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 once
 I
 know
 that,
 it's
 easier
 to


figure
 out
 the
 rest.
 And
 then
 I
 know


there's
 vowels
 in
 the
 name.
 And
 so


inherently
 you
 said
 that
 limits
 my


subset.
 You
 didn't
 do
 a
 vowel,
 did
 you?


>> No.


>> L.
 Are
 you
 thinking
 of
 an
 L?


>> No.


>> I
 got
 it.
 It's
 funny
 because
 by
 you


saying
 no,
 it
 means
 you
 gave
 away
 both.


I've
 written
 this
 down.
 Can
 you
 close


your
 eyes?
 For
 the
 viewers
 who
 are


watching
 this
 as
 a
 video,
 I'm
 going
 to


show
 them.
 And
 for
 everybody
 else
 to


know
 who's
 just
 listening
 in
 their


headphones
 while
 running
 or
 doing


something,
 this
 can't
 change
 what
 I


wrote
 down.
 Open
 it
 up.
 Open
 up
 your
 You


thought
 of
 an
 S
 but
 switched
 from
 the
 L.


Is
 that
 correct?
 Tell
 us
 all.
 What
 is


their
 first
 name?


>> Jules.


>> Jewels.


>> Working
 in
 the
 sales
 team
 at
 a
 startup


can
 be
 a
 strange
 experience
 because
 one


month
 you're
 chasing
 leads
 like
 the


future
 of
 the
 business
 depends
 on
 it,


which
 often
 it
 does,
 and
 then
 the
 next


month
 you're
 buried
 in
 them.
 Pressure


builds
 up
 and
 eventually
 it
 starts


clouding
 your
 judgment.
 Then
 you
 end
 up


making
 a
 reactive
 decision
 instead
 of
 an


informed
 one.
 Our
 sponsor,

 Drive,


is

 It
 helps
 you
 get


brutally
 clear
 on
 exactly
 where
 your


focus
 should
 be.
 It
 shows
 you
 what


opportunities
 have
 stalled
 and
 what
 is


worth
 your
 time
 and
 focus.
 and
 my
 team


have
 been
 using
 the
 new

So,
 it's
 time
 to
 join
 the
 100,000


companies
 that
 are
 already
 using


Piperive
 by
 going
 to
 piperive.com/ceo


now.


>> You
 know,
 you
 walk
 into
 rooms
 and
 people


hear
 that
 you're
 a
 mentalist.
 So,


they're
 already
 like
 somewhat
 on
 edge.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 can
 see
 you
 can
 see
 that
 they're


on
 edge,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 You
 got
 to
 sweeten
 it
 because


>> So,
 how
 what
 do
 you
 do
 about
 that?
 Cuz


everywhere
 you
 go,
 people
 are
 going
 to


be
 like,
 "Fuck,
 this
 guy
 might
 be
 able


to
 guess
 my
 you
 know,
 that's
 what


they're
 thinking.
 They're
 thinking
 he


can
 guess
 my
 bank
 pin,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to


give
 nothing
 away."
 So,
 you
 must
 be


meeting
 people
 that
 are
 like
 closed
 off


your
 entire
 life.
 How
 do
 you
 get
 them
 to


go
 from
 closed
 to
 open
 up?


>> I
 think
 it's
 being
 likable.
 So
 this,


think
 about
 it.
 If
 you
 met
 somebody
 who


could
 really
 read
 your
 mind
 and
 I
 can't


read
 minds,
 just
 I
 want
 to
 be
 clear


throughout
 the
 process
 cuz
 people
 say,


"Oh,
 what's
 he
 trying
 to
 teach?"
 I
 can't


read
 minds.
 I'm
 not
 psychic.
 I
 am
 not


supernatural.
 I
 don't
 claim
 to
 be.
 You


could
 do
 this.
 Maybe
 not
 as
 well
 because


I
 think
 there's
 an
 inherent
 talent.
 The


same
 as
 musical
 talent.
 I
 can't
 play
 a


guitar.
 I
 can't
 sing
 to
 save
 my
 life.
 No


matter
 how
 much
 training
 you
 give
 me,
 I


will
 never
 have
 the
 voice
 of
 Harry


Styles
 or
 Ed
 Sheeran.
 It's
 not
 in
 the


cards
 for
 me.


>> But
 you're
 tricking
 me
 to
 think
 that
 my


eye
 movements
 played
 a
 role.


>> So,
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 this.
 I
 am
 tricking


you
 to
 believe
 that
 certain
 things
 are


more
 important
 than
 others.
 Your
 eye


movements
 and
 body
 language
 play
 a
 role,


but
 whether
 it
 played
 a
 10%
 role,
 a
 50%


role,
 100%
 role,
 that's
 100%
 true.
 My


job
 is
 to
 misdirect
 you
 and
 to
 use


multiple
 methods.
 Yeah.


>> So
 that
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 go
 down
 a
 path


and
 you
 think
 you
 got
 me,
 I
 jump
 to
 the


next
 lane,
 I
 do
 it
 a
 different
 way.


>> There's
 also
 a
 possibility
 that
 0%
 of


that
 trick
 you
 just
 did
 was
 about
 my


eyes.


>> I
 didn't
 say
 it
 was
 about
 your
 eyes,


though,
 did
 I?


>> You
 said
 you
 looked
 up
 the
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5.


>> That
 is
 absolutely
 true.
 Try
 it
 for


yourself,
 though.
 Honestly,
 try
 it
 for


yourself.
 How
 many
 letters
 somebody


counts,
 if
 they
 have
 a
 long
 name,
 it


takes
 longer
 to
 process.
 You
 aren't


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 a
 name
 and


counting
 the
 number
 of
 letters
 in
 your


day-to-day
 life.
 So,
 if
 I
 were
 to
 show


you
 how
 to
 do it,
 you
 were
 to
 attempt
 it


and
 you
 were
 to
 get
 it
 right
 75%
 of
 the


time,
 which
 you'd
 be
 shocked
 that
 you


would,
 you'd
 then
 go,
 "Now
 what?
 Who


cares?"
 Most
 of
 you
 are
 not
 going
 to


take
 and
 spend
 the
 next
 decades
 learning


mentalism.
 Rather,
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 and


take
 the
 most
 important
 parts
 of


mentalism
 and
 show
 you
 how
 you
 can
 use


them.


>> Another
 huge
 one
 is
 just
 confidence.
 How


do
 people
 build
 confidence?
 When
 I
 was


14
 and
 I
 started
 doing
 this,
 was
 I
 this


hyperconfident
 teenager?
 No.
 My
 folks


just
 got
 divorced.
 My
 life
 was
 pretty


tumultuous.
 I
 think
 I
 did
 this
 as
 a
 way


to
 not
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 all
 of
 the


trauma
 and
 kind
 of
 sadness.
 And


confidence
 gets
 built
 over
 time.
 So,


what's
 a
 better
 way
 to
 fasttrack
 that?


For
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 you
 walk
 into
 a


room,
 you
 have
 to
 give
 a
 presentation.


Are
 you
 nervous
 as
 hell?
 I
 think
 most


people
 would
 say
 yes.
 Would
 you
 agree
 to


that?


>> Mhm.


What
 can
 you
 do
 tomorrow
 to
 get
 in
 there


and
 feel
 like
 you
 own
 the
 room
 the
 same


way
 I
 go
 on
 TV
 for
 a
 million
 people
 or


right
 now
 for
 millions?
 I
 think
 there's


so
 much
 of
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 there's
 a


panic
 that
 we
 have
 in
 us
 where
 we
 take


and
 we
 fear
 a
 certain
 feeling
 which
 is
 I


have
 certain
 things
 that
 I
 dread
 doing.


Like
 let's
 say
 I
 have
 to
 call
 someone


and
 give
 a
 call
 of
 things
 I
 don't
 want


to
 say.
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 turn
 someone


down
 for
 something.
 I
 I
 hate
 that.
 I'm


avoiding
 it
 at
 all
 lengths.
 The
 same
 way


you
 procrastinate
 things
 you
 don't
 want


to
 do.
 I
 have
 this
 little
 trick
 in
 my


mind
 where
 what
 I
 do
 is
 I
 ask
 myself,


what
 will
 I
 feel
 like
 tomorrow
 about


this?
 What
 will
 I
 feel
 like
 tomorrow?


What
 if
 I
 could
 fast
 forward
 my
 feelings


to
 tomorrow?
 And
 instead
 of
 just,
 you


know,
 up
 in
 the
 air,
 try
 it
 right
 now.


What's
 something
 that
 you,
 the
 listener,


don't
 want
 to
 do?
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 call


someone.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 deliver
 bad


news.
 You
 know,
 this
 person's
 about
 to


ream
 you
 out.
 You're
 avoiding
 it
 at
 all


costs.
 You're
 moving
 in
 your
 calendar
 to


tomorrow,
 the
 next
 day.
 You
 keep
 doing


that.
 Do
 it
 now.


And
 I
 want
 you
 to
 set
 an
 alarm
 24
 hours


from
 now.
 Put
 it
 in
 your
 in
 your
 I'm
 not


I'm
 for
 real.
 Put
 an
 alarm
 that
 says


tomorrow.
 Write
 down
 how
 you
 feel
 about


this
 scale
 of
 1
 to
 10.
 Right
 when
 you


finish
 the
 call,
 you're
 going
 to
 feel
 in


the
 dread
 before
 you're
 going
 to
 feel
 an


8
 n
 10
 of
 dread.
 The
 next
 day
 when
 the


alarm
 goes
 off,
 ask
 yourself,
 "How
 do
 I


feel?"
 Most
 of
 the
 time
 you
 feel


nothing.
 Two
 or
 three.
 It's
 out
 of


sight,
 out
 of
 mind.
 So,
 what
 if
 you


could
 trick
 your
 brain
 the
 same
 way
 I


tricked
 you
 to
 think
 your
 eye
 movements


have
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 it?
 Trick
 your


own
 brain
 to
 see
 how
 you
 feel
 a
 day
 from


now.
 You
 feel
 nothing.
 So,
 what
 if
 you


can
 just
 start
 doing
 that
 to
 yourself?


Rewire
 your
 brain
 and
 say,
 "I'm
 going
 to


feel
 nothing
 in
 a
 day.
 Screw
 it.
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 it
 now."
 And
 just
 that
 trick


of
 getting
 over
 procrastination
 builds
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 confidence.
 Another


one
 is
 I
 would
 walk
 up
 to
 tables
 and


people
 would
 kick
 me
 out.
 They'd
 be


like,
 "Get
 out
 of
 here.
 Good
 dude.
 K."


They
 wouldn't
 pay
 attention
 to
 me.


things
 that
 would
 hurt
 my
 feelings.
 So


what
 I
 did
 is
 I
 created
 in
 my
 mind
 some


way
 where
 I
 have
 two
 separate


personalities.
 This
 guy
 was
 O's
 the


entertainer,
 O's
 the
 magician,
 now
 O's


the
 mentalist.
 This
 guy
 was
 O's


Pearlman.
 They
 don't
 know
 the
 real
 me.


That's
 a
 different
 guy.
 So
 when
 I
 walked


up
 to
 a
 table
 and
 got
 turned
 down
 or


rudely
 rejected,
 instead
 of
 me
 feeling


that
 pain
 in
 myself,


I
 pushed
 it
 somewhere
 else.
 And
 I
 go,


you
 know what?
 They
 didn't
 like
 the


entertainer.
 That's
 a
 different
 guy.


That's
 not
 me.
 And
 so
 the
 same
 way
 that


if
 you
 took
 right
 now
 a
 bowl
 of
 water


right
 here
 and
 we
 poured
 salt
 in
 the


water,
 it's
 salt
 water.
 But
 what
 if
 we


could
 take
 an
 invisible
 small
 piece
 of


plastic
 and
 put
 it
 right
 down
 the
 center


and
 now
 you
 pour
 all
 the
 salt
 in
 one


side.
 This
 side
 is
 immune.
 This
 is
 fresh


water.
 If
 you
 can
 do
 that
 in
 your
 own


mind,
 the
 same
 way
 that
 I
 use
 my
 tricks


to
 trick
 your
 mind,
 trick
 your
 own
 mind,


that
 will
 take
 away
 the
 sting.
 Because


so
 many
 of
 us,
 we
 don't
 go
 after
 our


goals
 because
 we're
 scared
 of
 what


happens
 if
 they
 don't
 work
 out.
 It's
 all


about
 accountability.
 You
 fear
 the


rejection.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 get
 over
 that,


it
 is
 a
 superpower
 in
 life.
 The
 same
 way


you
 asked
 me,
 "How
 did
 you
 know
 it
 was


going
 to
 work?"
 Because
 I
 stopped


thinking
 about
 it
 not
 working.
 And


people
 that
 have
 that
 singular
 focus
 on


making
 something
 work,
 those
 are
 the


entrepreneurs.
 Those
 are
 the
 people
 that


you
 see
 achieve.
 Those
 are
 the
 athletes.


Those
 are
 the
 people
 who
 have
 a


hyperfixation
 and
 focus
 on
 a
 goal
 that


they
 will
 make
 it
 happen.
 They
 manifest


it.


>> And
 what
 about
 communication?
 Your


communication
 style
 and
 how
 important


that
 is.
 Like
 what
 what
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 when
 you're
 communicating
 as
 an


entertainer
 to
 make
 sure
 people
 are


paying
 attention
 and
 they're
 engaged?


>> Be
 watching
 the
 audience
 all
 the
 time.


The
 audience
 never
 lies.
 So
 you
 have
 to


really
 assess
 what
 the
 audience
 is


throwing
 at
 you.
 And
 I'm
 seeing
 people


and
 I'm
 seeing
 are
 they
 interested?
 Are


they
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 their
 seat?
 Are
 they


leaning
 forward?
 Indicators
 of
 interest.


Are
 they
 sitting
 back
 and
 checking
 their


watch?
 Are
 they
 yawning?
 Obviously,
 you


can't
 do
 this
 with
 everybody.
 When
 I'm


in
 a
 room
 with
 a
 thousand
 people,
 maybe


one
 guy's
 hung
 over.
 Maybe
 their
 baby


didn't
 sleep
 last
 night
 and
 they
 had
 a


redeye
 flight.
 I
 can't
 know
 everyone,


but
 I
 can
 watch
 individuals
 and
 see
 how


they're
 reacting
 to
 me.
 And
 I
 can


quickly
 change
 and
 pivot
 and
 see
 how
 I


can
 continue
 keeping
 their
 attention.


And
 if
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 this
 right


now,
 am
 I
 turning
 it
 off?
 Am
 I
 fast


forwarding?
 Am
 I
 getting
 tangible


takeaways?
 If
 I
 get
 three
 things
 from


this
 that
 I
 can
 put
 into
 action


tomorrow,
 this
 is
 smash
 success.
 Because


if
 I
 get
 one
 thing
 that
 somebody
 says
 to


me,
 like
 one
 tidbit
 that
 they
 say,
 I


feel
 like
 that
 can
 change
 your
 life.


Then
 take
 action.
 I'm
 all
 about
 action


because
 I
 think
 in
 so
 many
 instances


there's
 no
 accountability.
 Inspiration,


motivation
 is
 garbage.
 I
 could
 care
 less


if
 I've
 inspired
 you.
 I
 want
 action.


What
 is
 your
 goal?
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 lose


weight?
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 make
 a
 certain


amount
 of
 money?
 Are
 you
 making
 a


million
 dollars
 next
 year?
 Is
 that


really
 going
 to
 make
 you
 happy?
 So,
 a


lot
 of
 the
 time
 we
 make
 goals
 that
 we


think
 of,
 but
 then
 we
 get
 them.
 You


know,
 I
 have
 made
 more
 money
 in
 the
 last


10
 years
 than
 if
 you'd
 asked
 me
 10
 years


ago,
 I
 dreamt
 possible.
 Does
 that
 make


you
 happy?
 It
 makes
 life
 easier,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 just
 pure
 fulfillment.


I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 very,


very
 wealthy
 and
 they
 aren't
 happy.
 I'm


around
 a
 lot
 of
 wealthy
 people.
 It's


just
 a
 nature
 of
 my
 thing.
 And
 and
 I


asked
 myself,
 they're
 billionaires
 and


if
 this
 isn't
 making
 you
 happy,
 what
 is?


I
 don't
 think
 that
 money
 is
 always
 the


goal
 that
 you
 should
 attain.
 I


understand
 why
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


money
 as
 a
 kid.
 So
 that
 was
 like
 a


barometer
 of
 success
 for
 me.
 But
 as
 I


have
 kids
 and
 as
 I
 see
 that
 life
 is


short
 and
 feel
 my
 mortality,
 I
 realize


some
 things
 are
 much
 more
 important
 than


money.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 a
 goal,
 let
 this


be
 the
 cue.
 Not
 to
 inspire
 you,
 but
 to


literally
 take
 action
 right
 now.
 What
 is


it
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do?
 I
 somebody


talked
 to
 me
 the
 other
 day
 said,
 "Man,
 I


love
 watching
 you
 run.
 I
 would
 love
 to


run."
 Stop.
 Start
 running
 tomorrow.
 Put


a
 reminder
 in
 your
 calendar.
 Literally,


tomorrow
 my
 first
 run.
 Then
 put
 one
 30


days
 from
 now
 to
 make
 sure
 you're


accountable
 and
 then
 decide
 what
 makes


you
 accountable.
 For
 me,
 I
 don't
 like
 to


be
 embarrassed.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 write


to
 10
 people
 that
 I
 know
 and
 tell
 them


I'm
 signing
 up
 for
 a
 10K.
 So,
 that
 now


if
 I
 don't
 go
 through
 with
 it,
 it's


going
 to
 come
 up
 in
 a
 future


conversation
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 say,


"Hey,
 Steve,
 whatever
 happened
 with
 the


10K?"
 Now
 I
 have
 to
 eat
 humble
 pie
 with


10
 different
 people
 and
 say
 to
 them,
 you


know
 what,
 I
 didn't
 do
 it.
 Oh,
 oh,
 okay,


you
 didn't
 do
 it.
 I
 want
 that
 to
 be
 my


motivator.
 Maybe
 your
 motivator
 is


internal,
 maybe
 it's
 external,
 but
 find


what
 motivates
 you
 and
 use
 those
 levers


to
 generate
 action.


>> You
 know,
 in
 your
 profession,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 like
 with
 Darren
 Brown,
 a
 lot
 of
 it


is
 he'll
 make
 you
 think
 that,
 like
 we


said
 earlier,
 like
 it's
 it's
 my
 right


hand,
 but
 actually
 it's
 my
 left.


>> Yep.
 Like
 how
 do
 you
 contend
 with
 being


someone
 who
 whose
 job
 it
 is
 to
 sort
 of


misdirect
 me
 to
 make
 me
 think
 it's
 my


right
 hand,
 not
 my
 left
 or
 whatever,
 but


then
 also


trying
 to
 give
 people
 information
 that


will
 make
 them
 successful
 in
 their


lives.


>> Right.
 Well,
 the
 ethics
 of
 it.
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 sell
 you
 anything
 about
 being


a
 mind
 reader
 or
 a
 mentalist.
 This
 is
 a


separate
 pursuit.
 The
 skills
 surrounding


everything
 I
 do,
 those
 skills,
 it's
 like


how
 to
 win
 friends
 and
 influence
 people.


It's
 a
 book
 I've
 read
 over
 and
 over
 and


over.
 It's
 it's
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 it's


dated,
 but
 it's
 of
 a
 different
 era.
 The


skills
 that
 allowed
 me
 to
 reach
 near
 the


top
 of
 my
 profession
 aren't
 the
 tricks.


There's
 other
 people
 that
 can
 do
 that.


There's
 other
 people
 that
 can
 do
 this.


There's
 other
 people
 that
 can
 guess
 your


card.
 So,
 what
 led
 me
 to
 here?
 Do
 I
 do


it
 better
 than
 them?


>> I'll
 let
 you
 decide
 that.


>> My
 secrets
 to
 success
 are
 the
 exact
 same


ones
 you
 can
 apply
 to
 your
 life.
 That's


the
 key.
 The
 fact
 that
 I've
 made
 it


about
 them,
 not
 me.
 How
 have
 I
 been
 on


all
 these
 TV
 shows?
 How
 have
 I
 had
 such


a
 wide
 diversity?
 Has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


performing?
 It
 has
 to
 do
 with
 me
 turning


the
 mirror
 around.
 The
 moment
 you


realize
 that
 you
 will
 be
 successful
 in


your
 life
 when
 you
 start
 making
 other


people
 the
 star,
 thinking
 about
 them,


thinking
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 their


head,
 that's
 true
 mentalism.
 What
 are


they
 thinking
 and
 how
 do
 I
 deliver
 on


that?
 How
 do
 I
 make
 them
 look
 good?
 How


do
 I
 make
 them
 like
 me
 more?
 How
 do
 I


win
 them
 over
 so
 that
 when
 the
 moment


comes
 for
 them
 to
 recommend
 somebody
 or


to
 give
 them
 a
 raise
 or
 do
 something,


they
 know
 that
 you're
 the
 person
 that


they
 think
 of
 first?
 And
 I
 think
 those


skills,
 again,
 I
 wouldn't,
 it's
 not


really
 mentalism,
 but
 it's
 the
 exact


same
 tools
 that
 I
 use.
 It's
 not
 guessing


numbers
 or
 names.
 It's
 knowing
 how
 to


influence
 others.
 And
 if
 I
 wasn't
 able


to
 influence
 people,
 none
 of
 the
 things


I
 just
 did
 would
 work.
 You
 would
 just


say,
 "No,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 that."


on
 the
 skill
 of
 listening,
 which
 I
 I


think
 is
 also
 so
 important
 to
 what


you're
 saying
 there
 about
 being
 likable


and
 winning
 people
 over.
 Do
 you
 have
 a


system
 or
 a
 framework
 for
 being
 a
 great


listener?
 You
 talk
 about
 it
 a
 little
 bit


in
 the
 book
 near
 the
 end.
 I
 think
 you


have
 five
 ways
 to
 become
 a
 better
 active


listener.


>> Yes.


>> Can
 you
 run
 me
 through
 those?


>> Sure.
 Should
 I
 give
 you
 a
 funny
 story


that
 kind
 of
 led
 this
 off?
 So,
 I
 did
 a


party
 for
 Steven
 Spielberg.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 it
 was
 his
 father's
 99th
 birthday.


It
 was
 pretty
 intimate
 affair.


I
 was
 noticeably
 nervous
 in
 my
 mind,
 not


for
 the
 performance,
 but
 to
 meet
 Stephen


Spielberg.
 So,
 he
 defined
 an
 era
 of
 my


childhood
 and
 I
 feel
 likely
 for
 a


billion
 or
 several
 billion
 other
 people.


So,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show,
 he
 comes
 up


to
 thank
 me
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 ready.
 I
 was


able
 to
 ask
 Steven
 Spielberg


zero
 questions.
 Do
 you
 know
 why?
 He


talked
 to
 me
 the
 whole
 time.
 He
 kept


asking
 me
 questions
 rapid
 fire,
 this
 and


about
 my
 life
 and
 about
 what
 drove
 me


and
 this.
 And
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 keep


being
 like,
 "Pause.
 I
 got
 questions
 for


you.
 You're
 Steen
 Spielber.
 He
 made
 it


all
 about
 me.
 All
 about
 me.
 And
 I


learned
 it
 that
 day
 that
 that
 it's
 a


greater
 power
 to
 listen.
 And
 that
 the


most
 interesting
 person
 in
 a
 room
 tends


to
 be
 the
 most
 interested
 person
 in
 the


room.
 And
 that
 some
 of
 the
 people
 I've


seen
 that
 are
 the
 most
 successful,
 the


most
 authentic
 and
 genuine,
 they
 will


look
 you
 in
 the
 eye.
 They
 will
 lock
 in.


They
 will
 not
 be
 looking
 around
 at
 other


people.
 And
 they
 will
 give
 you
 their


100%
 undivided
 attention.
 And
 they
 will


ask
 you
 questions
 that
 other
 people


haven't
 asked
 you
 before.
 And
 I


challenge
 you,
 don't
 just
 do
 the
 normal


question
 when
 you
 meet
 somebody.
 Oh,


what
 do
 you
 do
 for
 a
 living?
 Oh,
 what?


We
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 do
 that,
 we
 go
 into


autopilot.
 I
 go
 into
 autopilot.
 And
 I'm


not
 judging
 you.
 Most
 people
 do
 that,


right?
 50%
 of
 people
 have
 to
 be
 below


average,
 right?
 And
 and
 49.9%
 are
 above


average.
 that's
 inherently
 the
 challenge


yourself
 to
 be
 the
 outlier
 and
 think
 of


a
 question
 you
 can
 ask
 someone
 if
 you


have
 time
 to
 think
 of
 it
 in
 advance
 or


in
 the
 moment
 that
 throws
 them
 out
 of


autopilot
 that
 makes
 them
 think,
 "Wow,
 I


haven't
 really
 thought
 of
 that
 before."


Asking
 questions
 that
 are
 not
 yes
 or
 no


questions
 are
 also
 great.
 Ask
 questions


that
 let
 them
 explore
 who
 they
 are.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 active


listening.
 And
 I
 let
 the
 audience
 guide


me
 to
 what's
 of
 interest
 to
 them.
 When


we
 walked
 in
 here
 today,
 I
 said
 to
 think


of
 a
 favorite
 of
 of
 a
 category.
 If
 I


knew
 the
 category,
 would
 I
 be
 able
 to


guess
 what
 the
 answer
 was?


>> No.


>> What
 is
 the
 question?
 You
 know what?


Tell
 it
 to
 me.
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 I
 don't


want
 to
 write
 anything
 down.
 I
 want
 you


to
 just
 say
 it
 out
 loud.
 Give
 me
 the


question.
 What
 is
 the
 question
 that
 you


have
 defined
 the
 answer
 to?
 Give
 me
 that


question.
 Ask
 it
 to
 me.
 What
 is
 my


favorite


>> car?


>> What
 is
 my
 favorite
 car?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 think
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 can
 know


that?
 No
 prior
 research
 could
 have


alerted
 me
 to
 it.


>> No
 prior
 research.
 No.


>> You
 decide
 the
 same
 way
 that
 you
 did


with
 jewels.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 think
 of
 the


name
 of
 the
 car,
 whether
 it's
 the
 brand,


whether
 it's
 the
 make,
 and
 I
 want
 you
 to


pick
 one
 letter
 out
 from
 anywhere
 from


from
 is
 I'm
 assuming
 it's
 more
 than
 one


word
 unless
 you
 just
 said
 Ford.
 I
 again


I
 don't
 want
 to
 lead
 you,
 but
 if
 it
 is


more
 than
 one
 word
 and
 if
 it's
 two,


three,
 four
 words,
 decide
 on
 one
 of
 the


words.
 Have
 you
 decided
 on
 one
 of
 the


words?


>> Yeah.
 One
 of
 the
 words.


>> Don't
 say
 another
 word.
 Now,
 see,
 just


saying
 that
 was
 interesting.
 Decide
 on


one
 of
 the
 words.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 pick
 one
 of
 the
 letters.
 Something


interesting
 to
 you.
 Grab
 the
 one
 letter


and
 just
 focus
 on
 that
 one
 letter.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 have
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 you
 asked
 me.
 You
 said
 it's
 all


misdirection,
 right?
 The
 eye
 movements.


This
 all
 just
 window
 dressing.
 But
 you


just
 gave
 something
 away.
 You
 said
 one


of
 the
 words
 with
 a
 question


because
 you
 were
 confused.
 You
 didn't


know
 what
 to
 do.


If
 it
 was
 only
 one
 word,
 I
 would
 never


have
 said
 that
 if
 it
 was
 three
 words.


Why
 would
 it
 be
 one
 of
 the
 words?
 Of


course,
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 words.
 So,
 you


did
 one
 and
 then
 I
 think


this
 one
 went
 through
 your
 head.
 You


read
 you
 went
 to
 the
 last
 Did
 you
 think


of
 the
 last
 letter


of
 it?


>> No.


>> Okay.
 So,
 that
 would
 have
 been
 my
 first


guess,
 but
 now
 that
 you
 didn't,
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 back.


Are
 you
 thinking
 the
 letter
 Y?


>> No.


Maserati,
 Ferrari,
 Lamborghini.
 That's


not
 like
 you.


Close
 your
 eyes.


Open
 your
 eyes.
 I've
 written
 it
 down.
 I


can't
 change
 my
 mind.


>> What
 car
 is
 it?


>> It's
 uh
 It's
 my
 Cyber
 Truck.


It
 is
 your
 cybert
 truck.
 That's
 what
 I


thought
 it
 would
 be.


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 was
 thinking
 of
 the
 letter
 T.


>> T.


>> I
 did
 originally
 think
 of
 Y.


>> You
 did?


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 moved
 to
 to
 T.
 Yeah.


>> If
 I
 got
 it
 right
 every
 time,
 it
 would


be
 a
 magic
 show.


>> So
 sometimes
 when
 you
 perform,
 you


things
 must
 go
 wrong.
 Sometimes


>> it
 depends
 like
 what
 level
 they
 go
 wrong


at
 what
 scale.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 it
 goes
 destructively
 like


catastrophically
 wrong,
 it's
 not
 always


good.


>> Tell
 me
 a
 time
 when
 it
 went


catastrophically
 wrong.


>> Oh,
 so
 you
 can
 dig
 up
 old
 TV
 appearances


uh
 from
 15
 years
 ago
 where
 just
 you
 know


purely
 I
 started
 learning
 that
 if
 you
 do


something
 linear,
 which
 is
 if
 I
 show
 you


my
 hand
 and
 tell
 you
 where
 this
 is


going,
 then
 you
 have
 the
 power.
 What
 do


I
 mean
 by
 that?
 If
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 going
 to


guess
 this
 and
 then
 I
 get
 it
 wrong,
 then


you
 know
 I
 got
 it
 wrong."


>> What
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 the
 ending
 of
 the


movie?
 Then
 if
 I
 show
 you
 an
 alternate


ending,
 you
 don't
 know
 that
 the
 movie


wasn't
 supposed
 to
 end
 that
 way.
 So,
 I


learned
 early
 on
 that
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


let
 you
 hold
 the
 cards.
 I
 hold
 the


cards.
 So,
 when
 you
 even
 the
 the the


notion
 of
 get
 it
 wrong
 means
 you
 knew


what
 making
 it
 getting
 it
 right
 was.


Does
 that
 make
 sense?
 Yeah.


>> But
 what
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 getting


it
 right
 was
 because
 I'm


>> doing
 so
 many
 different
 things
 at
 once


that
 I
 will
 eventually
 find
 a
 way
 to
 get


it
 right.


>> Mhm.
 You
 see
 what
 I
 mean?


>> Yeah.
 And
 have
 you
 learned
 any
 ways
 to


break
 the
 ice
 in
 social
 situations?
 You


I
 think
 you
 talk
 about
 you
 do
 you
 talk


about
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 the
 book,
 but


um
 you
 you
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 you


talked
 about
 is
 object
 sort
 of
 handling


the
 objection
 that
 you're
 assuming
 one


has
 approaching
 from
 a
 different
 angle,


but
 just
 generally
 in
 life
 when
 you
 meet


these
 people
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 disarm


people.


>> Yes.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 else
 that
 is
 worth


knowing
 there
 that
 people
 can
 use
 for


their
 in
 their
 everyday
 lives?


>> I
 like
 having
 an
 inner
 monologue
 out


loud.
 So,
 I
 like
 to
 take
 things
 that
 I


know
 everyone
 is
 thinking


>> and
 open
 up,
 show
 some
 vulnerability.


So,
 a
 great
 way,
 you're
 in
 an


uncomfortable
 social
 setting.
 What
 do


you
 want
 to
 do?
 You
 want
 to
 shut
 down?


You
 want
 to
 be
 here?
 I
 think
 walking
 up


to
 somebody
 has
 a
 real
 power
 and
 say,


"I'm
 so
 nervous.
 I
 don't
 know
 anyone


here.
 Do
 you
 know
 anyone
 here?"
 Like


that
 moment
 of
 opening
 yourself
 up
 and
 I


don't
 want
 to
 call
 it
 oversharing


because
 some
 people
 take
 that
 to
 too


much
 of
 a
 degree
 and
 start,
 you
 know,


telling
 you
 too
 much,
 but
 showing
 that


you
 are
 a
 real
 person
 and
 vulnerable.
 I


think
 just
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 magical
 quality


and
 I've
 had
 people
 that
 do
 it
 to
 me


that
 you
 gain
 an
 intimacy
 and
 a


familiarity
 with
 them
 very
 quickly
 that


you
 wouldn't
 have
 if
 we
 were
 just
 small


talking
 each
 other.
 Have
 you
 ever
 met


those
 people
 that
 have
 that
 instant


charisma
 that
 when
 they
 walk
 in
 the
 room


everyone
 gravitates
 towards
 them?
 And


you
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 is.
 What
 is


that
 quality
 they
 have?
 Did
 they
 train


it?
 Is
 it
 innate?
 Are
 they
 born
 with
 it?


>> Um
 for
 me
 I
 didn't
 have
 that.
 So
 I


cheated
 and
 started
 doing
 magic
 tricks.


I
 remember
 Jimmy
 Carr
 saying
 to
 me
 that,


you
 know,
 people
 think
 comedians
 are


depressed
 or
 whatever,
 but
 he
 said
 a


better
 question
 to
 ask
 is
 always,
 who


are
 you
 trying
 to
 cheer
 up,


>> right?


>> And
 I
 wonder
 if
 that's
 relevant
 at
 all


to
 your
 situation.


>> I
 think
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 connect
 with


people.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 think
 that
 I
 was
 nervous,
 a
 little
 bit


awkward.
 I
 wasn't
 introverted.
 I
 had
 no


problem
 walking
 up
 to
 strangers,
 but
 I


think
 that
 it
 became
 this
 just
 uh
 this


addiction


>> to
 watching
 people
 being
 amazed
 and


overjoyed
 in
 the
 reactions.
 I
 live
 for


the
 reactions.
 Some
 people
 that
 do


magic,
 they
 do
 it
 for
 themselves
 in
 a


guilty
 way.
 I
 kind
 of
 do
 as
 well
 because


there
 is
 a
 selfish
 angle
 to
 seeing


reactions.
 But
 to
 me,
 it's
 more
 the
 joy.


And
 to
 this
 day,
 what
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that


I
 do
 for
 a
 living
 is
 not
 deceive.
 My
 job


is
 not
 to
 fool
 you.
 My
 job
 is
 to
 create


memorable
 moments.
 Not
 amazing
 moments.


Amazing
 is
 a
 subset.
 Memorable.
 Because


if
 I
 amaze
 you
 and
 you
 forget
 it,
 I
 have


failed.
 I
 failed.
 It's
 the
 same
 as
 if
 I


walk
 into
 a
 movie
 that's
 an
 action


movie.
 I
 eat
 a
 lot
 of
 popcorn.
 I
 walk


out.
 10
 minutes
 later
 you
 say
 to
 me,


"What
 was
 the
 movie
 about?"
 I
 don't


know.
 Right?
 That
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 a


month
 later
 you
 ask
 me,
 "Have
 you
 seen


that
 movie?"
 And
 I
 go,
 "Did
 I
 see
 that


movie?"
 That
 right
 there,
 that
 response


is
 the
 death
 for
 what
 I
 do.
 apathy


>> and
 in
 the
 book
 in
 page
 166
 you
 talk


about
 improving
 one's
 memory


>> yes


>> what
 do
 I
 need
 to
 know
 why
 does
 it


matter
 to
 improve
 my
 memory
 and
 in
 what


way
 does
 improving
 my
 memory
 help
 me
 to


connect
 with
 other
 people
 so
 we've


gotten
 to
 the
 point
 where
 we
 don't
 need


our
 memory
 right
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


know
 how
 to
 drive
 to
 a
 place
 a
 city
 next


door
 they
 literally
 with
 if
 GPS
 went
 out


good
 luck
 right
 you
 don't
 know
 anyone's


phone
 numbers
 how
 many
 people's
 phone


numbers
 do
 you
 have
 memorized


>> few
 and
 far
 between


>> one.


>> Exactly.
 Tomorrow
 your
 iPhone
 goes
 away.


No,
 no,
 no
 Apple,
 no
 cloud,
 you're


screwed.
 You're
 screwed.
 Am
 I
 right?
 If


you
 can't
 get
 that
 back,
 your
 life
 is.


So,
 what
 do
 we
 need
 our
 memory
 for?
 I


think
 memory
 is
 a
 superpower
 because
 no


one
 expects
 you
 to
 have
 it
 anymore.


Years
 ago,
 you
 need
 now
 you
 don't.
 So,


I'm
 going
 to
 give
 a
 great
 example,
 one


that
 I
 have
 in
 my
 book,
 which
 is


something
 applicable
 where
 you
 can't


cheat.
 Cheat
 is
 I
 have
 my
 phone.
 And
 I


feel
 a
 lot
 of
 us,
 whether
 we're
 parents


or
 kids
 or
 teens
 or
 any
 stage
 of
 life


you
 are,
 you're
 going
 to
 meet
 new
 people


at
 some
 point
 soon.
 You
 meet
 them,
 you


shake
 their
 hand,
 you
 say
 hello,
 you


just
 forgot
 their
 name.
 Literally,
 they


just
 said
 it
 to
 you,
 and
 you
 forgot
 it.


How
 many
 times
 this
 occurred
 to
 you?
 I'm


guessing
 numerous.
 And
 now
 you
 can't


enjoy
 that
 conversation
 because
 all
 you


do
 is
 feel
 dread.
 Now
 you're
 looking
 for


someone
 around
 that
 you
 know
 to


introduce
 them
 and
 pray
 to
 God.
 You
 go,


"This
 is
 Steven.
 Say
 hello."
 Like,
 tell


them
 your
 name.
 You
 know,
 you
 want
 that


moment.
 So,
 I
 have
 a
 a
 a
 trick,
 a
 tip


for
 that
 specific
 situation,
 as
 well
 as


others
 for
 memory,
 but
 I've
 repurposed


the
 instructions
 on
 a
 shampoo
 bottle
 so


it
 sticks
 in
 your
 head.
 Shampoo
 bottles


have
 three
 words
 on
 the
 back.
 Lather,


rinse,
 repeat.
 Right?
 Lather
 makes
 your


hair
 smell
 good.
 Rinse
 cleans
 your
 hair.


Repeat,
 we
 got
 to
 sell
 more
 Pantene


Prov.
 So,
 we
 all
 know
 that.
 Everyone


knows
 lather,
 rinse,
 repeat.
 I
 will


describe
 it
 as
 this.
 Listen,
 repeat,


reply.
 Listen,
 repeat,
 reply.
 So
 easy.


The
 first
 step
 sounds
 silly.
 It's


comical.
 Why
 am
 I
 even
 saying
 this?
 The


first
 step
 is
 what
 95%
 of
 us
 do
 wrong.


We
 don't
 actually
 listen.
 When
 you
 hear


that
 person's
 name,
 it's
 not
 a
 memory


issue.
 You
 never
 even
 knew
 the
 name
 to


begin
 with.
 Because
 right
 when
 you


walked
 up
 to
 them,
 just
 like
 a
 computer,


read,
 write.
 Very
 hard
 to
 read
 and
 write


at
 the
 same
 time
 for
 our
 brains.
 You


were
 thinking
 of
 something
 else.
 you


were
 thinking
 of
 what
 you
 were
 going
 to


say
 back
 to
 them
 in
 most
 instances.
 So


at
 that
 moment,
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 to


do
 is
 actually
 listen,
 quiet
 your
 mind.


So
 simple,
 so
 easy,
 but
 that's
 we
 screw


up.
 Right
 when
 I
 walk
 up
 to
 you,
 I
 make


sure
 that
 I've
 heard
 your
 name
 because
 I


instantly
 repeat
 it
 twice.
 Stephen,
 is


it
 Steve
 or
 Steven?
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure


I've
 just
 said
 your
 name
 three
 times


already.
 Your
 chance
 of
 forgetting
 it


have
 gone
 down
 dramatically.
 The
 last


one
 is
 reply,
 which
 is
 use
 one
 of
 the


three
 following
 tactics.
 one,
 you
 could


learn
 how
 to
 spell
 it.
 You
 have a
 name


that
 can
 be
 spelled.
 So
 I
 go,
 is
 it


Steven
 with
 a
 V
 or
 a
 PH
 and
 you
 with
 a


V,
 I
 go,
 I
 like
 Steven
 with
 a
 V
 better.


That's
 the
 right
 way.
 Am
 I
 right?
 So
 now


I've
 associated
 it
 Steven
 with
 a
 V.
 If


it's
 not
 a
 name
 like
 that,
 if
 it's,
 you


know,
 Jacob,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 spell


that.
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 to
 you,
 uh,
 I


might
 comment.
 I
 go,
 Jacob,
 I
 love
 that


shirt.
 Where'd
 you
 get
 that
 from?
 The


V-neck.
 Jacob,
 really
 sharp.
 So
 now
 I've


created
 a
 visual
 hook.
 You're
 Jacob
 with


the
 V-neck
 shirt.
 Now
 I
 remember
 you.


Third
 one
 is
 is
 if
 you
 want
 you
 can
 do


something
 that's
 a
 connector
 to
 someone


else
 you
 know.
 So
 if
 I
 know
 a
 Stephen


it's
 so
 funny
 you
 know
 my
 sister's


dating
 a
 guy
 named
 Stephen.
 Small
 world.


So
 you've
 really
 quickly
 connected
 it.


That
 happens
 in
 5
 seconds
 what
 I
 just


said.
 Everyone
 likes
 a
 compliment.


Everyone
 likes
 a
 hook.
 You
 will
 not


forget
 that
 person's
 name
 for
 the
 rest


of
 the
 party.
 I
 promise
 you.
 And
 this


works
 on
 people
 of
 all
 ages.
 It's
 not
 a


memory
 issue.
 If
 you
 can
 remember
 your


best
 friend's
 name,
 you
 can
 remember
 the


name
 of
 somebody
 you
 met
 at
 a
 party


after
 five
 seconds
 if
 you
 practice
 and


do
 exactly
 what
 I
 just
 said.
 And
 I
 think


a
 huge
 part
 of
 it
 as
 someone
 that
 does


meet
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 is
 you
 go
 into
 the


the
 meetings
 with
 people
 and
 because
 you


don't
 really
 think
 the
 small
 stuff


matters.
 You
 don't
 think
 most
 people


don't
 think
 someone's
 name
 matters
 that


much.
 They
 think
 they're
 walking
 into


the
 presentation,
 they're
 pitching
 for
 a


million
 dollars.
 They're
 thinking
 about


the
 campaign.
 They're
 thinking
 about,


you
 know,
 how
 they're
 going
 to
 structure


the
 offer.
 They're
 not
 thinking
 about


the
 name
 being
 pertinent.
 So,
 you
 walk


in,
 you
 shake
 hands.
 Hi,
 Deborah.
 Nice


to
 meet
 you,
 Deborah.
 You
 walk
 to
 your


chair,
 you're
 still
 thinking
 about
 the


campaign,
 the
 campaign,
 the
 campaign,


and
 within
 3
 minutes,
 you've
 lost
 their


name.
 And
 um
 I
 do
 think
 it
 really
 has
 a


huge
 impact
 when
 I
 when
 I
 was
 reading


your
 book,
 I
 was
 thinking
 like,
 do
 you


know what?
 I
 don't
 do
 a
 good
 job
 of


that.
 I
 meet
 loads
 of
 people
 all
 the


time.
 I
 walk
 up,
 I
 say
 my
 name,
 they
 say


theirs.
 For
 me,
 that's
 not
 important


information,


>> right?


>> Um
 and
 and
 I
 thought,
 you
 know,


>> until
 you
 get
 it
 wrong,
 and
 then
 then


that's
 the
 memory
 they
 carry
 of
 you.
 I


would
 say
 to
 people,
 if
 you
 don't
 know


someone's
 name,


>> we
 think
 that
 it's
 a
 dreadful
 thing
 to


ask
 them
 again.
 It's
 an
 avoidable
 thing


with
 this,
 but
 I
 would
 still
 say
 that


you
 still
 showing
 interest
 and
 there's
 a


few
 tactics
 around
 it,
 but
 say,
 "Forgive


me,
 but
 I
 really
 would
 like
 to
 know.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 it
 slipped
 my
 mind.
 Tell


me
 your
 name
 again,
 please."
 I
 think


even
 that
 is
 a
 much
 better
 way
 to
 play


it
 because
 again,
 you're
 human,
 they're


human,
 everyone's
 vulnerable.
 I
 don't


think
 there's
 anything
 wrong
 with
 that.


So,
 I'm
 okay
 with
 letting
 people
 know


that
 there's
 a
 human
 side
 and
 humanize


it.
 And
 sometimes
 if
 I
 can
 figure
 it


out,
 I
 will.
 But
 I'll
 say,
 "Give
 me
 a


clue."
 And
 I
 go,
 "Help
 me
 out.
 Tell
 me


where
 he's
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god."
 And


sometimes
 I
 have
 a
 memory
 hook
 and
 I'll


remember
 who
 introduced
 us.
 I
 go,
 "Oh,
 I


met
 you
 through
 Steven."


>> I've
 had
 so
 many
 founders
 speak
 to
 me


and
 say,
 "Why
 didn't
 this
 particular
 ad


that
 I
 ran
 on
 this
 platform
 work
 for


me?"
 Maybe
 the
 copy
 wasn't
 good,
 the


creative
 wasn't
 strong,
 but
 usually
 the


problem
 is
 they're
 not
 having
 the
 right


conversation
 because
 that
 ad
 never


reached
 the
 right
 person.
 And
 if
 you're


in
 B2B
 marketing,
 that
 is
 much
 of
 the


game.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 LinkedIn
 ads


solves
 that
 problem
 for
 you.
 Their


targeting
 is
 ridiculously
 specific.
 You


can
 target
 by
 job
 title,
 seniority,


company
 size,
 industry,
 and
 even


someone's
 skill
 set.
 And
 their
 network


includes
 over
 a
 billion
 professionals.


About
 130
 million
 of
 them
 are
 decision


makers.
 So,
 when
 you
 use
 LinkedIn
 ads,


you're
 putting
 your
 brand
 in
 front
 of


the
 right
 people.
 And
 LinkedIn
 ads
 also


drive
 the
 highest
 B2B
 return
 on
 ad
 spend


across
 all
 ad
 networks
 in
 my
 experience.


If
 you
 want
 to
 give
 them
 a
 try,
 head


over
 to
 linkedin.com/dary.


And
 when
 you
 spend
 $250
 on
 your
 first


LinkedIn
 ads
 campaign,
 you'll
 get
 an


extra
 $250
 credit
 from
 me
 for
 the
 next


one.
 That's
 linkedin.com/dary.


Terms
 and
 conditions
 apply.
 Just
 give
 me


15
 seconds
 to
 explain
 how
 you
 can
 build


a
 viable
 business
 online.
 The
 people
 I


see
 winning
 in
 life
 don't
 have
 a
 perfect


plan.
 They
 just
 take
 the
 first
 step
 and


then
 the
 next
 and
 then
 they
 keep
 going.


They
 stay
 obsessed
 and
 they
 stay


consistent.
 And
 Standstorm,
 a
 platform
 I


co-own
 and
 one
 of
 our
 sponsors,
 is
 the


best
 first
 step
 to
 help
 turn
 your


knowledge
 into
 income.
 It
 only
 takes

couple
 of

 to
 launch
 your


business
 and
 start
 selling
 digital


products,

 without
 any

 of


entrepreneurs,

 take
 control
 of
 their


future.

And
 what
 else?
 What
 else
 should
 we


should
 my
 audience
 know
 about?
 You're


someone
 that
 focuses
 on
 the
 audience.


What
 else
 should
 they
 know
 about
 that


you
 think
 can
 directly
 improve
 their


life?


I
 mean,
 I've
 given
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 the


core
 tenants
 that
 I
 think
 have
 made
 me


successful,
 which
 is
 eliminating
 that


fear
 of
 rejection,
 utilizing
 notes,


making
 it
 about
 other
 people.
 Uh,
 I


think
 I
 think
 wrapping
 things
 up
 in
 a


story
 is
 a
 huge
 one
 that
 we
 touched
 upon


lightly,
 but
 that


>> why
 why
 a
 story?


>> Because
 stories
 are
 remembered.
 Stories


are
 interwoven
 into
 our
 DNA.
 Each
 of
 us


have
 a
 story
 to
 tell.
 I
 think
 such
 a
 big


one
 is
 deciding
 what
 makes
 you


memorable.
 The
 more
 that
 you
 can
 become


memorable
 to
 others,
 the
 more
 people


talk
 about
 you,
 it
 benefits
 you
 no


matter
 what
 you
 do
 in
 life.
 When
 you


meet
 somebody,
 know
 that
 you're
 going
 to


weave
 the
 narrative
 of
 what
 they
 leave,


what
 they
 think
 of
 you,
 right?
 You
 have


to
 kind
 of
 their
 memory
 is
 malleable.


There's
 a
 trick
 I
 used
 to
 do
 when
 I
 was


a
 teenager
 where
 I
 would
 have
 somebody


pick
 a
 card.
 It
 was
 a
 card
 trick.
 They


would
 put
 the
 card
 back
 in.
 They
 would


sign
 it.
 I
 would
 throw
 it
 on
 the


ceiling.
 The
 deck
 would
 fall
 down,
 but


their
 signed
 card
 stayed
 stuck
 on
 the


ceiling.
 But
 when
 they
 described
 the


procedure
 back
 to
 someone
 else,
 they


would
 leave
 out
 the
 part
 with
 me


throwing
 the
 deck.
 Why
 did
 they
 forget


such
 an
 important
 detail?
 And
 I
 I


couldn't
 understand
 why.
 It's
 not
 that


their
 memory
 was
 faulty.
 Something


happened.
 I
 realized
 what
 it
 was.
 What
 I


put
 my
 attention
 on,
 they
 put
 their


attention
 on.
 Like
 everything
 in
 life,


if
 you're
 focused
 on
 the
 negative,
 you


start
 to
 feel
 negative.
 I
 when
 I
 threw


the
 deck
 up,
 sometimes
 wouldn't
 look
 up


with
 it.
 I
 would
 throw
 the
 deck
 up.
 I


wouldn't
 look
 and
 then
 I'd
 catch
 it.


Such
 a
 small
 minute
 detail.
 But
 me
 doing


that
 meant
 I
 caught
 the
 deck.
 No
 one


knew
 what
 happened.
 And
 I
 let
 them


look
 up
 and
 discover
 the
 card
 themselves


rather
 than
 me
 do
 it.
 Somehow
 in
 that
 in


their
 brain,
 they
 deleted
 that
 one


detail
 of
 me
 throwing
 the
 deck.
 And
 now


I
 had
 a
 miracle.
 And
 that
 changed
 my
 way


of
 thinking
 from
 there
 on
 out.
 Which
 I


said
 to
 myself,
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 I


do.
 It
 matters
 what
 people
 remember.
 And


what's
 the
 story
 they
 tell
 others?


>> The
 thing
 I
 really
 learned
 from
 that
 is


that
 your
 focus
 is
 driving
 someone


else's
 focus.
 So
 when
 I'm,
 you
 know,


when
 I'm
 going
 through
 my
 life,


I
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 my
 focus
 is
 in
 the


right
 place,
 the
 place
 that
 I
 want
 you


to
 it
 to
 be.
 And
 I
 notic
 that
 sometimes


as
 a
 podcaster
 because
 obviously
 so
 I'm


trying
 to
 manage
 this
 conversation
 and


I've
 got
 these
 notes
 written
 in
 front
 of


me.
 I've
 got
 pens,
 books,
 props.
 I've


got
 a
 little
 net
 under
 front
 of
 me
 that


has
 photos
 in
 it
 and
 other
 bits
 and


pieces
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 And
 I
 do


notice
 that
 during
 the
 podcast


conversation,
 if
 I
 don't
 look
 up
 at
 the


guest
 and
 I
 start
 looking
 down
 a
 little


bit
 or
 even
 if
 I'm
 just
 looking
 down
 to


see
 my
 next
 bullet
 point
 or
 to
 think


about
 something,


>> right,


>> I
 distract
 the
 guest.
 But
 it
 also
 in


everyday
 life,
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I


think
 we're
 all
 guilty
 of,
 and
 you
 talk


about
 this
 in
 your
 book,
 is
 um


we
 sometimes
 reach
 for
 our
 phone
 a


little
 bit,


>> right?


>> Your
 card
 story,
 that's
 what
 it
 said
 to


me.
 It
 said
 that,
 oh
 my
 god,
 people's


focus
 really
 is
 where
 your
 focus
 is.
 So


if
 I'm
 having
 a
 great
 conversation
 with


you
 and
 you're
 a
 client
 or
 something
 and


I
 just
 glance
 at
 my
 watch,
 you
 just
 did


it
 then
 with
 me
 again.
 You
 just
 glanced


down
 at
 my
 hand,


>> right?


>> And
 I
 never
 realized
 until
 you
 said
 that


card
 thing
 how
 important
 it
 was
 to
 make


sure
 my
 focus
 is
 in
 the
 right
 place.


your
 focus
 is
 in
 the
 right
 place
 but


also
 know
 the
 fact
 that
 your
 memory
 is


malleable.
 So
 in
 my
 profession
 I
 employ


all
 different
 tactics.
 I
 can
 tell
 you


one
 is
 confusion.
 Your
 brain
 is
 it's


very
 difficult
 for
 your
 brain
 to
 read


and
 write
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So
 if
 I
 want


to
 distract
 you
 from
 a
 method
 and
 I


confuse
 you
 then
 it's
 exactly
 like
 an


etch
 a
 sketch.
 Maybe
 you've
 drawn
 a


picture
 and
 the
 moment
 you
 get
 confused


and
 you
 uh
 you
 forget
 what
 you
 just
 did


exactly
 and
 the
 etch
 of
 sketch
 has
 just


been
 shaken
 and
 now
 you
 can't
 recount


the
 series
 of
 events
 properly
 and
 at


that
 moment
 you've
 now
 created
 this


beautiful
 watercolor
 painting
 that


hasn't
 dried.
 I
 can
 move
 some
 of
 the


pieces
 around
 and
 I
 can
 redraw
 your


picture
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I
 can
 change


your
 memory
 of
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 during


certain
 points
 when
 I'm
 performing
 and


this
 has
 to
 do
 when
 you
 talked
 about


public
 speaking
 and
 storytelling,
 I
 tell


you
 the
 story
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 tell


others
 and
 I
 take
 out
 the
 pieces
 I
 want


out.
 I
 want
 this
 gone.
 I
 want
 this
 gone.


I
 want
 this
 gone.
 I'm
 going
 to
 edit
 your


memories.


>> Give
 me
 a
 specific
 example.


>> Well,
 that's
 that's
 a
 nature
 of
 what
 I


do.
 So
 in
 in
 a
 certain
 routine
 again


what
 I
 would
 ask
 someone
 if
 I
 asked


somebody
 to
 think
 of
 someone
 important


to
 them
 and
 then
 later
 on
 I
 guess
 the


name
 of
 their
 first
 kiss


they
 will
 forget
 how
 the
 question
 was


orchestrated
 how
 I
 set
 up
 the
 initial


ask
 and
 what
 happened
 during
 the
 initial


ask
 and
 then
 the
 story
 they
 will
 tell
 to


someone
 else
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 but
 he


guessed
 my
 first
 kiss.
 Now
 when
 they


tell
 that
 story
 he
 goes
 he
 told
 me
 to


think
 of
 anyone
 and
 and
 I
 thought
 of
 my


first
 kiss
 and
 he
 guessed
 it.
 What
 if
 I


didn't?
 What
 if
 I
 narrowed
 it
 down
 and
 I


actually
 told
 you
 to
 think
 of
 your
 first


kiss?
 But
 the
 initial
 question
 was
 think


of
 anyone
 and
 see
 all
 those
 people


swirling
 around
 your
 mind
 and
 then
 one


person
 comes
 up
 to
 you
 haven't
 seen


since
 elementary
 school.
 First
 girl
 you


ever
 kissed,
 you
 you
 were
 blown
 away.


Now
 the
 people
 that
 watched
 it
 have
 also


seen
 a
 different
 effect.
 It's
 known
 as
 a


dual
 reality.
 The
 reality
 one
 person


experiences
 is
 different
 than
 the
 other.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 If
 you
 walk
 in
 to
 a
 conversation


in
 the
 middle,
 you
 don't
 know
 the


context,
 but
 you
 know
 the
 ending.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I'm
 using
 that
 because
 again


when
 you
 tell
 me
 the
 methods
 of


mentalism,
 mentalism
 is
 all
 about
 group


dynamics,
 the
 way
 people
 think.
 If
 I
 was


performing
 for
 you
 in
 a
 group,
 it
 would


be
 utterly
 different
 and
 completely


easier.
 This
 one-on-one
 interaction
 is


far
 more
 difficult
 because
 I
 have
 no


lanes
 to
 weave
 around.
 It's
 like
 if
 I


was
 passing
 you
 in
 a
 car
 on
 a
 four-lane


highway,
 I've
 got
 space
 right
 now.
 You


and
 me
 are
 locked
 in.
 It's
 very


difficult
 for
 me
 to
 use
 others
 cuz
 the


way
 you
 feel
 next
 to
 someone
 else,


you'll
 behave
 differently
 than
 by


yourself.
 And
 you're
 someone
 that,
 you


know,
 started
 doing
 this
 at
 a
 very
 young


age
 and
 has
 developed
 and
 evolved
 their


skill
 set
 over
 time.
 And
 so
 you've
 got


five
 kids.
 And
 I'm
 I'm
 wondering
 how


important
 you
 think
 obsession
 is
 to
 get


to
 the
 very
 top.
 You've
 got
 to


>> It's
 a
 blessing.
 It's
 a
 blessing.
 If


somebody
 can
 find
 an
 obsession,


>> you've
 got
 to
 the
 top
 of
 an
 industry


where
 very
 few
 people
 get
 to
 the
 top
 of.


And
 even
 if
 they
 do,
 they
 don't
 end
 up


on
 the
 biggest
 platforms
 in
 the
 world.


So,
 thinking
 about
 the
 characteristics


of
 your
 success,
 um,
 for
 this
 kid,
 it


was
 obviously
 obsession
 was
 a
 huge
 part


of
 that,
 right?


>> Yes.


>> How
 old
 were
 you
 in
 this
 photo?


>> Uh,
 probably
 14.
 Probably
 right
 when
 I


started
 a
 restaurant.
 That
 looks
 14
 to


me.


>> Okay.
 14
 then.
 And
 you're
 43
 now.


>> That's
 right.


>> So,
 you've
 been
 doing
 this
 decades
 and


decades
 and
 decades.


>> The
 majority
 of
 my
 life.


>> How
 important
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is
 to
 to


reach
 the
 top
 of
 any
 industry?


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 would
 say
 the
 time


matters
 as
 much
 because
 I've
 seen
 people


that
 are
 phenoms
 in
 much
 in
 much
 like


more
 compressed
 times.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


say
 that
 you
 need
 your
 30
 years.


Passion.
 The
 people
 that
 excite
 me
 the


most
 to
 be
 around
 in
 my
 life.
 The
 people


that
 I
 look
 up
 to
 and
 I'm
 on
 the
 edge
 of


my
 seat
 always
 have
 a
 passion.
 I
 don't


care
 what
 that's
 for.
 I
 don't
 care
 if


you
 are
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 trash
 man
 and
 your


obsession
 is
 is
 trash.
 Like
 something


that
 I
 would
 never
 think
 about.
 I've
 met


so
 many
 people
 where
 they
 have
 a
 topic


that
 meant
 nothing
 to
 me
 at
 the
 moment,


but
 once
 I
 start
 speaking
 to
 them,
 their


level
 of
 excitement,
 their
 their
 feeling


like
 the
 fact
 that
 they're
 so
 invested


makes
 me
 feel
 invested.


>> But
 to
 hone
 your
 skills
 to
 the
 point


that
 you
 can
 reach
 the
 peak
 of
 a


mountain.
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 someone


called
 DJ
 EZ,
 and
 he
 was
 saying
 to
 me,


he
 spends
 seven
 hours
 a
 day,
 he's
 a


great
 DJ,
 and
 when
 I
 watch
 him,
 it's


like
 watching
 a
 magician
 play
 the
 decks.


And
 he
 said
 to
 me
 he
 spends
 seven
 hours


a
 day,
 sometimes
 listening
 to
 700


different
 new
 tracks
 a
 day,
 just


listening
 to
 20
 seconds
 of
 each.
 And
 I


don't
 think
 people
 often
 get
 to
 see
 that


level
 of
 obsession.
 They
 see
 people
 sat


here,
 but
 they
 don't
 get
 to
 see
 the
 all


the
 like
 the
 messy
 journey
 to
 here,


>> right?


>> And
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 important
 to
 show


them
 what
 that
 messy
 journey
 to
 here


looks
 like
 because
 then
 they
 can
 decide


for
 themselves
 in
 their
 own
 life
 if


whatever
 thing
 they're
 pursuing
 is
 worth


the
 trade.
 Like
 is
 it
 worth
 it
 to
 sit


here
 and
 to
 be
 who
 you
 are
 now
 for
 like


that?
 You
 say
 worth
 it
 as
 if
 it's
 a


negative
 thing.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 gave
 a


definition
 to
 my
 life.
 I
 think
 that
 to


have
 a
 passion
 is
 something
 so
 few
 of
 us


I've
 hit
 the
 lottery
 in
 life.
 I
 get
 to


meet
 interesting
 people.
 I
 get
 to
 bring


joy.
 I
 get
 to
 live
 my
 dream.
 Everything


I
 do
 is
 of
 my
 own
 valition.
 Like
 I
 I


couldn't
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 I'd


complain
 for
 an
 iota
 of
 a
 second.
 I've


won
 the
 lottery
 times
 the
 lottery
 times


the
 lottery.
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 It's
 not


even
 my
 profession.
 I
 have
 a
 mindset


where
 I
 could
 die
 tomorrow,
 right?


Everybody
 who
 doesn't
 think
 that
 way


that
 you
 don't
 have
 gratitude
 for
 today


is
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 a
 natural


optimist.
 I
 just
 think
 that


>> But
 I
 mean,
 what
 does
 that
 actually
 look


like?
 Cuz
 I
 No
 one
 no
 one
 was
 there
 to


see
 those
 what
 30
 20
 30
 years.


>> How
 much
 work
 was
 there?
 And
 is
 it
 like


you
 were
 doing
 it
 part-time?
 Is
 it
 free


time?
 Is
 it
 the
 shower?
 Are
 you
 thinking


about
 it
 in
 the
 shower?
 Is
 it


>> So
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 it


for
 decades.
 And
 now
 even
 now
 I
 it


consumes
 my
 thoughts
 at
 certain
 points


in
 time
 even
 though
 I
 try
 to
 try
 to
 also


be
 present
 in
 the
 moment.
 It's
 not
 like


a
 absolute
 obsession.
 7
 hours
 a
 day
 is


pretty
 rough
 but
 the
 muse
 of
 creativity


comes
 to
 me
 and
 and
 it's
 so
 fulfilling.


It's
 the
 same
 way
 like
 this
 book
 putting


this
 book
 on
 paper
 you
 you're
 an
 author


as
 well
 was
 such
 an
 exceptional


challenge
 because
 my
 thoughts
 and
 then


crafting
 them
 onto
 the
 page
 into
 words


and
 also
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 who
 cares


about
 me?
 I
 I
 always
 have
 this
 mindset


of
 I
 need
 to
 prove
 to
 you.
 I
 don't
 come


from
 the
 assumption
 of
 you
 should
 watch


me
 because
 I'm
 great.
 I
 have
 an
 inverse.


I
 said
 I
 need
 to
 define
 to
 you
 why
 you


should
 be
 watching,
 why
 you
 should
 be


listening,
 why
 this
 should
 excite
 you,


why
 this
 should
 amaze
 you.
 Hopefully,
 it


inspired
 you
 to
 take
 action
 and
 you
 got


something
 tangible
 that
 will
 provide
 a


value
 in
 your
 life.
 And
 I
 wouldn't
 have


written
 the
 book.
 Trust
 me,
 the
 the
 book


I
 didn't
 need
 to
 write
 this
 book.
 I


wrote
 the
 book
 because
 so
 many
 people


had
 said
 to
 me,
 "We
 want
 to
 know
 what


helped
 you
 achieve
 success."
 And
 they're


fascinated
 by
 this
 pursuit.
 And
 I
 think


that
 was
 it.
 I
 just
 was
 driven
 by
 the


people
 around
 me
 that
 they
 said
 you


should
 write
 this.
 And
 I
 felt
 I
 finally


had
 a
 story
 to
 tell.


>> And
 what's
 the
 one
 thing
 about
 your


success
 and
 your
 new
 life
 that


if
 this
 guy
 knew
 he
 may
 have
 hesitated
 a


little
 bit
 to
 pursue
 the
 life
 that
 you


now
 have?


>> I
 think
 being
 very
 busy
 and
 success
 has


its
 pitfalls.
 If
 you
 assign
 your


self-esteem
 to
 something
 others
 can
 give


you,
 be
 it
 fame,
 be
 it
 money,
 be
 it


things
 that
 are
 intangible
 and
 that
 can


be
 taken
 away
 and
 you
 don't
 define
 your


self
 worth
 by
 something
 internal
 like


your
 own
 drive,
 competing
 against


yourself,
 creating
 your
 own
 goals,
 then


it's
 fleeting.
 Fame,
 for
 example,


there's
 going
 to
 be
 ups
 and
 downs.
 Every


career
 has
 a
 life
 cycle.
 Right
 now,


things
 are
 going
 very
 well.
 There's
 no


question
 that
 a
 certain
 point
 the
 peak


hits
 and
 now
 you
 go
 down.
 And
 it's


inevitable.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 about


that.
 I'd
 like
 to
 continue
 the
 peak
 or


continue
 climbing
 and
 climbing
 climbing.


But
 when
 that
 happens,
 I'm
 aware
 of
 it


and
 I
 will
 not.
 It's
 not
 a
 something


that
 will
 define
 who
 I
 am.
 This
 is
 part


of
 it.
 I
 think
 having
 outside
 interests


and
 challenging
 yourself
 outside
 your


comfort
 zone
 for
 me,
 ultramarathons,


marathons,
 athletic
 pursuits
 that
 cannot


be
 bought.
 They
 must
 be
 earned.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 something
 we
 value
 more
 and


more
 in
 our
 day-to-day
 life
 because


again
 there's
 influencers,
 there's


people,
 there's
 followers,
 there's
 all


this
 stuff
 that
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 call


fickle,


but
 it
 can
 be
 bought.
 What
 can
 be


earned?
 Earned
 are
 things
 that
 you
 this


has
 been
 earned
 by
 you.
 This
 has
 been


you
 putting
 in
 sweat
 equity
 for
 decades,


believing
 in
 yourself.
 Each
 time
 you
 get


a
 big
 guest,
 you
 harness
 your
 momentum


and
 get
 a
 bigger
 guest.
 You've
 earned


this.
 You've
 created
 a
 team
 around
 you.


I
 think
 that's
 something
 notable
 and


that
 people
 should
 decide
 what's
 your


goal
 and
 as
 you
 strive
 towards
 it
 that's


where
 you
 feel
 the
 fulfillment
 for
 me


it's
 been
 being
 on
 the
 road
 like
 the
 mo


biggest
 negative
 is
 being
 away
 from
 my


children
 and
 wife
 and
 that's
 success
 and


I
 can't
 not
 do
 that
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be


successful
 I
 have
 to
 be
 gone
 a
 lot
 and


so
 I
 have
 to
 find
 that
 balance
 between


the
 two
 of
 having
 my
 kids
 miss
 me
 but


also
 creating
 a
 life
 for
 them
 in
 the


future
 and
 also
 juggling
 the
 fact
 that
 I


have
 you
 know
 major
 career
 ambitions


>> and
 is
 there
 anything
 else
 that
 my


audience
 might
 be
 able
 to
 take
 away
 an


action
 in
 their
 own
 lives
 that
 is
 in


line
 with
 maybe
 this
 this
 David
 Gogggins


quote
 on
 the
 front
 of
 your
 book
 learn
 to


master
 the
 most
 powerful
 weapon
 your


mind
 is
 there
 anything
 else
 that
 my


audience
 should
 be
 aware
 of
 so
 that
 they


can
 show
 up
 better
 in
 their
 lives
 um
 in


the
 pursuit
 of
 their
 goals


>> I
 think
 defining
 your
 goals
 is
 huge


looking
 yourself
 in
 the
 mirror
 and
 being


honest
 and
 seeing
 what
 that
 voice
 really


says
 to
 you
 because
 I
 just
 like


everybody
 else
 have
 had
 feelings
 of


inadequacy
 feelings
 of
 I'm
 not
 going to


be able
 to
 pull
 this
 off
 and
 it's
 not


that
 it's
 not
 as
 if
 I'm
 there's
 a


superhuman
 thing
 of
 I'm
 you
 know
 I'm


putting
 my
 head
 down
 I'm
 going
 to
 get


through
 it
 like
 Gogggins
 doesn't
 stop
 if


you
 ever
 met
 him
 he
 is
 a
 machine
 he's


amazing
 but
 he
 goes
 out
 and
 he'll
 tell


you
 he's
 the
 first
 one
 who
 doesn't
 go


want
 to
 go
 out
 and
 run
 when
 it's
 raining


and
 cold
 and
 freezing
 but
 you
 know
 why


he
 does
 it
 because
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 do


it
 that's
 where
 the
 real
 work
 is
 when


I'm
 doing
 a
 workout
 that's
 exceptionally


hard
 when
 it
 gets
 to
 the
 hardest
 part


that's
 when
 I
 tell
 myself
 all
 of
 this


was
 easy
 this
 is
 where
 I'm
 actually


growing
 so
 I
 challenge
 you
 right
 now
 to


assign
 yourself
 a
 goal
 right
 now.
 If
 you


get
 one
 thing
 out
 of
 this
 podcast,


decide
 one
 thing
 that
 you
 want
 to
 strive


for.
 Define
 it.
 Define
 it.
 Don't
 do


these
 pie
 in
 the
 sky
 things.
 Goals
 that


are
 achievable
 have
 to
 be
 quantifiable.


Be
 it
 a
 number,
 be
 it
 something


achievable.
 Decide
 what
 it
 is
 and
 make


tomorrow
 the
 first
 day
 you
 go
 after
 it.


And
 create
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 will


help
 you
 succeed,
 not
 fail.
 Most
 of
 us


when
 we
 start
 a
 goal,
 the
 joke
 is
 you


start
 January
 1st.
 everyone's
 starting


their
 fitness
 journey.
 By
 February,
 no


one's
 in
 the
 gym
 anymore.
 Why
 is
 that?


Why
 does
 everyone
 give
 up?
 Because
 the


hard
 work
 is
 at
 the
 beginning.
 Those


first
 few
 weeks
 of
 setting
 a
 habit
 in


place.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 here


that
 are
 all
 about
 how
 you
 form
 habits.


I
 literally
 put
 in
 the
 book
 proven


habits
 for
 success.
 It's
 not
 tricks.
 For


example,
 atomic
 habits
 had
 a
 huge
 impact


on
 me.
 Some
 of
 these
 books
 that
 show
 you


where's
 that
 inflection
 point
 from
 you


trying
 to
 do
 something
 to
 you
 ingraining


it
 in
 your
 muscle
 memory.
 And
 now
 it


becomes
 self-fulfilling.
 You
 keep
 doing


it
 because
 you
 like
 doing
 it.
 I
 didn't


love
 running
 when
 I
 started.
 Now
 running


is
 my
 vacation.
 I
 enjoy
 running.
 It


gives
 me
 a
 flow
 state.
 I
 make
 up
 new


ideas.
 I
 get
 to
 kind
 of
 check
 in
 with


myself.
 I
 think
 physical
 activity
 is
 so


important.
 So
 many
 of the
 chronic


diseases
 and
 things
 we
 have
 are


lifestyle
 choices
 and
 inactivity.
 We


could
 solve
 so
 many
 huge
 problems
 we


have
 simply
 by
 eat
 healthier
 and
 start


working
 out
 a
 little
 more.
 And
 nobody


wants
 to
 hear
 that.
 But
 you
 do
 a
 little


bit
 of
 hard
 work.
 you
 continue
 and
 you


maintain.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 hoping


that's
 useful.
 But
 that
 that's
 what
 I'd


want
 people
 to
 do.
 If
 you
 take
 action


tomorrow
 and
 start
 making
 your
 goals


happen,
 get
 inside
 your
 own
 head.
 That's


what
 I
 want
 you
 to
 do
 right
 now.
 But
 do


you
 remember
 when
 I
 had
 you
 close
 your


eyes
 and
 I
 had
 you
 see
 hundreds
 of


different
 people?
 I
 had
 you
 envision


people
 that
 you've
 met,
 famous
 people,


people
 that
 you
 like,
 people
 you
 care


about,
 all
 those
 different
 people,
 and


one
 person
 tapped
 you
 on
 the
 shoulder,


gave
 you
 a
 piece
 of
 advice.
 Mhm.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 that?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 piece
 of
 advice
 set
 in
 motion


you
 thinking
 of
 jewels.


>> Yeah.


>> Who
 was
 the
 person
 who
 tapped
 you
 on
 the


shoulder,
 you
 turned
 around,
 you
 looked


them
 in
 the
 eye,
 and
 they
 said
 something


to
 you
 that
 changed
 your
 life,
 created
 a


memorable
 moment,
 and
 put
 in
 place
 that


domino
 effect.
 Tell
 me,
 who
 did
 you


think
 of?


>> Michelle
 Obama.


>> Open
 up
 that
 piece
 of
 paper.


>> Funny.


It's
 a
 photo
 of
 Michelle
 Obama.


She
 looks
 gorgeous
 there.


[Music]


>> Okay,
 we
 have
 a
 closing
 tradition
 on


this
 podcast
 where
 the
 last
 guest
 leaves


a
 question
 for
 the
 next
 guest
 without


knowing
 who
 they're
 leaving
 it
 for.
 And


the
 question
 that's
 been
 left
 for
 you


is,


>> "Oh,
 fantastic.


>> If
 you
 could
 live
 forever,
 would
 you?


And
 why
 or
 why
 not?"


I
 think
 I
 would.
 I
 think
 I
 would.
 Uh,
 an


obsession
 of
 mine
 growing
 up
 has
 been


science
 fiction.
 My
 favorite
 books
 to


read,
 the
 ones
 that
 just
 capture
 my


imagination.
 And
 there
 are
 so
 many
 books


I've
 read
 about
 immortality.


And
 uh
 there's
 a
 book
 that
 this
 brings


to
 mind
 uh
 by
 Octavia
 E.
 Butler,
 which


is
 underrated.
 It's
 called
 Wild
 Seed,


and
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 read
 it.


It's
 a
 sci-fi
 book,
 and
 it's
 it
 delves


into
 this
 exact
 subject.
 And
 just
 what


would
 it
 be
 like
 to
 see
 all
 the
 people


around
 you
 pass
 away
 and
 the
 sadness
 and


then
 what
 would
 you
 do?
 Because
 at
 some


point,
 you'd
 feel
 empty.
 People
 just


die,
 right?
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 think
 of


it
 as
 the
 life
 of
 an
 insect.
 Just
 they


disappear.
 They
 come,
 they
 go,
 they


come,
 they
 go.
 And
 I
 think
 that


eventually
 you
 would
 revert
 back
 to


being
 completely
 numb
 and
 cold.
 But
 at


the
 same
 time,
 death
 is
 just
 that
 abyss


that
 everyone,
 no matter
 how
 much
 we


avoid
 thinking
 about
 it,
 talking
 about


it,
 you're
 going
 to
 die.
 I'm
 going
 to


die.
 In
 one
 day,
 you'll
 have
 that
 final


breath.
 Will
 you
 know
 it's
 going to


happen?
 Will
 you
 not?
 What
 will
 you


think
 about
 in
 those
 moments?
 What
 will


you
 go
 into
 it
 with?
 Will
 you
 still
 have


that
 fear
 of
 death?
 I
 I
 think
 our
 whole


lives
 are
 an
 extension
 of
 trying
 to


avoid
 thinking
 about
 our
 eventual
 death.


I
 think
 I
 would
 love
 to
 live
 forever,


but
 I
 bet
 you
 once
 I
 live
 forever,
 it


would
 start
 to
 be
 a
 curse.


I
 can't
 wait
 to
 think
 of
 the
 question


I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 the
 next
 person.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you
 for
 writing


a
 book
 that
 inspires
 people
 to
 live


their
 better
 life.
 And
 I
 think
 all
 the


principles
 in
 here
 are
 all
 human


principles
 that
 focus
 on
 how
 we
 can


relate
 better
 to
 other
 people.
 And
 so


many
 people
 are
 struggling
 to
 connect


with
 other
 people
 for
 so
 many
 reasons.


And
 that's
 causing
 so
 much
 downstream


mental
 health
 issues
 and
 physiological


issues
 and
 disconnection
 in
 the
 world.


And
 we're
 seeing
 that
 increasingly
 if


you
 go
 on
 the
 internet
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of


disconnection
 because
 we're
 struggling


to
 relate
 to
 people.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


you
 know
 the
 most
 I
 think
 for
 me
 the


most
 important
 byproduct
 of
 the
 work


that
 you
 do
 is
 you
 make
 people


curious
 and
 open-minded
 and
 there's
 so


much
 that
 comes
 from
 that
 people
 just


being
 a
 bit
 more
 curious
 and
 that's
 you


know
 the
 all
 people
 get
 the
 magic
 of
 it.


I
 think
 it
 makes
 people's
 minds


expansive.
 And
 if
 people
 have
 expansive


minds,
 then
 that
 might
 just
 be
 the


catalyst
 to
 all
 types
 of
 progress.


>> I
 love
 it.


>> Do
 you
 know what
 I'm
 saying?
 Like
 that


>> I
 think
 being
 open-minded
 and
 having
 a


different
 feeling
 than
 the
 usual,
 which


is
 in
 our
 day-to-day,
 we
 get
 into
 this


autopilot
 where
 yes,
 we
 feel
 pings
 of


joy,
 pings
 of
 anxiety,
 pings
 of


depression,
 pings
 of
 happiness.


>> My
 I
 told
 you
 the
 thing
 I
 got
 addicted


to
 was
 giving
 people
 this
 different


feeling.
 Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 a
 feeling
 you
 lose
 out.


Children,
 you
 see
 it
 in
 their
 eyes.


Again,
 it's
 it's
 a
 little
 hokey
 to
 say,


but
 when
 I
 see
 my
 three-year-old
 or
 my


2-year-old
 discover
 something
 new
 and


you
 see
 it
 through
 their
 eyes,
 it's
 a


gift.
 It's
 something
 you
 get
 back


because
 once
 you're
 an
 adult,
 you
 can't


have
 that
 same
 thing
 because
 you've


become
 jaded
 to
 the
 world.
 And
 suddenly


for
 them
 to
 see
 a
 a
 butterfly
 fly
 and


it's
 like
 this
 joyful
 experience
 and


seeing
 it
 through
 a
 kid's
 eyes,
 it's


honestly
 it
 it's
 been
 the
 greatest
 joy


of
 my
 life
 is
 seeing
 joy
 of
 my
 kids.


It's
 seeing
 that
 cuz
 it's
 in
 our
 DNA.


That's
 my
 version
 of
 immortality.


>> And
 humans
 lose
 that.
 We
 get
 more


>> humans
 lose
 that
 more
 and
 more.
 And
 it's


sad
 to
 me
 because
 I
 have
 lost
 it
 knowing


how
 I
 do
 the
 things
 I
 do.
 So
 to
 ask
 me


the
 good
 question
 is
 if
 I
 get
 fooled
 by


another
 magician
 or
 mentalist,
 how
 does


it
 make
 me
 feel?
 Amazing.
 It's
 the
 best


feeling.
 And
 I
 try
 immediately
 to
 hold


back
 the
 part
 of
 me
 that
 wants
 to
 know


how
 it
 was
 done.
 Because
 right
 away


there's
 a
 professional
 curiosity.
 The


same
 way
 that
 a
 movie
 star
 or
 a
 director


can't
 watch
 a
 movie
 and
 just
 think
 of


it.
 They're
 watching
 here's
 how
 you
 did


the
 camera,
 here's
 this
 panning
 shot,


here's
 the
 ISO,
 right?
 They
 can't


disconnect
 from
 the
 how
 the
 sausage
 is


made.
 Yeah.


>> I
 because
 those
 moments
 are
 so
 few
 and


far
 between.
 I
 instantly
 in
 my
 mind
 stop


I
 stop
 myself
 from
 the
 how
 and
 I
 enjoy


that
 wonder
 because
 it's
 so
 few
 for
 me


that
 I
 can't
 because
 I
 know
 how


everything's
 done.
 So
 when
 I
 get
 it,
 I


love
 it.


>> It's
 like
 um
 the
 day
 you
 figured
 out


Santa
 Claus
 wasn't
 real.
 It's
 like


bursting
 an
 illusion.
 And
 when
 I
 figured


out
 Santa
 Claus
 wasn't
 real,
 my
 world


got
 small.
 like
 the
 possibilities
 of
 the


world
 got
 smaller
 because
 there
 when


magic
 existed
 anything
 was
 possible
 and


that's
 a
 great
 place
 to
 live
 but
 when
 I


found
 out
 Santa
 Claus
 wasn't
 real
 I
 was


like
 oh


>> you
 know


>> yes


>> it's
 like
 gh
 there's
 no
 magic
 in
 this


world


>> right


>> and
 that's
 not
 a
 nice
 way
 to
 believe
 and


you're
 you're
 you
 know
 the
 work
 that


you're
 doing
 and
 the
 performances
 that


you
 do
 the
 entertainment
 you
 bring
 keeps


people's
 minds
 open
 and
 lets
 them


imagine
 be
 creative
 and
 believe
 that


there's
 still
 magic
 in
 this
 world
 and


that's
 a
 wonderful
 thing
 I
 highly


recommend
 people
 go
 get
 your
 book
 I'm


going to
 link
 it
 below
 and
 put
 it
 on


screen
 for
 anyone
 that
 wants
 to
 grab


habit.
 It's
 called
 Read
 Your
 Mind:


Proven
 Habits
 for
 Success
 from
 the


World's
 Greatest
 Mentalist.
 And
 the


people
 on
 the
 back
 are
 some
 of
 which
 are


my
 friends.
 I've
 got
 an
 investor
 of
 mine


on
 here.
 Um
 many
 of
 my
 former
 podcast


guests
 on
 here
 as
 well,
 like
 Jay
 Shetty


and
 Mark
 Cuban
 and
 Adam
 Grant.
 And
 um
 on


the
 front,
 David
 Gogggins.

 you
 for
 putting
 this
 out
 in
 the


world.

 I
 enjoy
 this.
 Even
 though


your
 recent
 one
 on
 AI
 scared
 the
 crap


out
 of
 me,
 but
 I'm
 honored
 to
 have
 been


a
 guest
 and
 I
 can't
 wait
 to
 write
 a


question
 for
 the
 next
 person
 and
 live


on.

 I'm
 about
 to
 say
