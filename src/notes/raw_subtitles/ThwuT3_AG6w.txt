engineers
 are
 turning
 to
 origami
 for


inspiration
 for
 all
 types
 of


applications
 from
 medical
 devices
 to


space
 applications
 and
 even
 stopping


bullets


but
 why
 is
 it
 that
 this
 ancient
 art
 of


paper
 folding
 is
 so
 useful
 for
 modern


engineering


origami
 literally
 folding
 paper
 dates


back
 at
 least
 400
 years
 in
 japan


but
 the
 number
 of
 designs
 was
 limited


there
 were
 only
 a
 handful
 of
 patterns


maybe
 100
 200
 total
 in
 japan


nowadays
 there
 are
 tens
 of
 thousands


that
 have
 been
 documented
 and
 most
 of


that
 change
 happened
 in
 the
 20th
 century


there
 were
 a
 handful
 of
 japanese
 origami


masters
 and
 by
 far
 the
 most
 successful


of
 them
 was
 a
 man
 named
 akira
 yoshizawa


who


created
 thousands
 of
 new
 designs
 wrote


many
 many
 books
 of
 his
 works


and
 his
 work
 inspired
 a
 worldwide


renaissance
 of
 origami
 creativity
 well
 i


wanted
 to
 fold
 a
 cactus


the
 first
 thing
 one
 needed
 to
 do


is
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 i
 get
 spines
 on
 a


cactus
 so
 you
 can
 imagine
 if
 i
 can
 make


two
 spines
 here


i
 could
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 to
 make
 a


whole
 row


then
 i
 can
 go
 back
 do
 a
 complete
 design


that's
 what
 this
 is


[Laughter]


and


and
 this
 is
 actually
 the
 cactus
 and
 the


pot


are
 from
 a
 single
 sheet
 of
 paper


the
 paper's
 green
 on
 one
 side
 red
 on
 the


other
 that
 whole
 thing
 is
 this
 thing
 so


this
 is


this
 is


one
 uncut
 square
 of
 paper


how
 big
 was
 that
 piece
 of
 paper
 and
 this


is
 about
 a
 one
 meter
 square


so


there
 is
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 size
 reduction


to
 go
 from
 a
 meter
 down
 to
 here
 but
 you


need
 that
 to
 get
 all
 of
 the
 spines
 and


how
 long
 did
 that
 take
 to
 make


that


took
 about
 seven
 years


from
 start
 to
 finish


wow


why
 is
 origami
 this


thing
 that
 was
 created
 for
 aesthetics


mainly
 why
 is
 it
 so
 useful
 i
 guess
 is


the
 question
 for
 for
 like
 you
 know


structural
 things
 that
 were
 for


mechanical
 engineering
 or
 for
 space


applications
 like
 why
 does
 it
 find


itself
 in
 so
 many
 of
 these
 applications


why
 is
 it
 so
 useful


well
 the
 thing
 that
 makes
 origami


useful


is
 it
 is
 a
 way


of
 transforming
 a
 flat
 sheet


into
 some
 other
 shape
 with
 relatively


little
 processing


this
 is
 a
 folded
 pattern


it's
 called
 a
 triangulated
 cylinder
 it


is
 by
 stable
 meaning
 it's
 stable
 in
 two


positions
 this
 is
 one
 and
 then
 if
 i
 give


it
 a
 twist


this
 is
 the
 other
 this
 really
 has
 a


bunch
 of
 bi-stable
 mechanisms
 in
 it


because
 i
 can


you
 can
 see
 how
 it
 sort
 of
 pops
 into


place


but
 if
 you
 combine
 the
 two
 mechanisms


going
 in
 different
 directions
 then
 you


get
 the
 sort
 of
 magical
 color
 change


effect
 yeah
 that's
 impressive
 so
 you


look
 at
 this
 and
 you
 say
 okay
 that
 is
 a


cute
 paper
 toy


is
 it
 anything
 more
 than
 that
 and
 the


answer
 is
 yes


does
 that
 turn
 into
 that


turns
 into
 that
 yep
 we're
 working
 with
 a


company
 called
 two
 against
 surgical
 that


does
 the
 da
 vinci
 surgical
 robot


where
 they
 wanted
 to
 be
 able
 to
 insert
 a


flexible
 catheter
 with
 uh
 with
 the
 robot


but
 the
 flexible
 catheters
 tend
 to


buckle
 and
 stuff
 so
 we
 had


developed
 these


origami
 bellows


that
 if
 you
 look
 down
 there
 there's
 uh


a
 hole
 that
 no
 matter
 how
 far
 we
 move


this
 that
 that
 stays
 the
 same
 size


on
 the
 inside
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 we


can
 put
 the
 catheter
 in
 there


and
 as
 the
 catheter
 moves
 and
 it's


getting
 inserted
 into
 the
 body
 it
 still


has
 supports
 along
 the
 way


or
 for
 another
 example


here
 i
 have
 a
 foldable


bulletproof


collapsible
 wall


it's
 based
 on
 the
 yoshimura
 crease


pattern
 meanings
 might
 make
 this
 out
 of


a
 bulletproof
 material
 can
 be
 very


compact
 being
 a
 police
 officer's
 car


and
 deploy
 out
 and
 be
 bulletproof


but
 would
 it
 actually
 work


well
 they've
 put
 it
 to
 the
 test


using
 12
 layers
 of
 kevlar
 it
 can
 stop


bullets
 from
 a
 handgun
 and
 a
 new
 design


featuring
 interchangeable
 panels
 should


be
 able
 to
 stop
 rifle
 rounds


those
 and
 that
 vial
 that
 is
 those
 are


actually


bullets
 that
 have
 been
 stopped
 by


origami


an
 intrinsic
 benefit
 of
 origami
 is
 that


the
 simple
 act
 of
 folding
 a
 material
 can


make
 it
 more
 rigid


i
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 this


yeah
 more
 origami


but
 i
 was
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 a
 way
 of


making
 the
 can
 stronger
 without
 actually


like
 thinner
 metal
 right


but
 for
 engineering
 applications
 the


more
 common
 challenge
 is
 how
 to
 fold


thick
 rigid
 materials
 this
 is
 uh


polypropylene
 okay
 very
 rigid
 there's
 no


way
 that
 i'm
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 to
 fold


that
 into


this
 vertex
 so
 this
 is
 an
 example
 it


shows
 a
 couple
 things
 surrogate
 folds
 we


can
 use
 to
 replace
 the
 the
 creases
 and


then
 also


that
 piece
 of
 polypropylene
 folds
 up
 and


it
 also
 accommodates
 the
 thickness


by
 cutting
 or
 scoring
 materials
 and


adding
 hinges
 as
 necessary
 thick
 rigid


materials
 can
 in
 effect
 be
 folded


this
 is
 useful
 for
 example
 in
 deploying


solar
 panels


this
 pattern
 is
 perhaps
 the
 granddaddy


of
 deployable
 structures
 it's
 called
 the


miura
 ori
 it's
 been
 used
 for
 solar


arrays
 in
 fact
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first


patterns
 that
 flew
 on
 a
 space
 mission


back
 in
 1995


it
 was
 called
 the
 space
 flyer
 mission
 as


you
 see
 here


it
 all


opens
 and
 closes
 in
 a
 single
 motion
 and


when
 it
 flattens
 it's
 it's
 very
 thin
 and


compact
 it's
 a
 fun
 pattern
 called
 the


origami
 flasher
 and


you
 get


this
 kind
 of
 interesting


flasher
 motion


this
 has
 been
 proposed
 as
 a
 design
 for


satellite
 solar
 arrays
 increasing


compactness
 for
 launch
 and
 reliability


in
 deployment


[Music]


a
 new
 area
 for
 origami
 research
 is
 in


improving
 the
 aerodynamics
 of
 freight


locomotives
 the
 thing
 with
 freight


locomotives
 is
 you
 know
 they're
 just


like
 bricks
 going
 down
 the
 tracks
 so


their
 aerodynamics
 are
 horrible
 ideally


i'd
 like
 to
 have
 a
 nose
 cone
 on
 the


front
 of
 a
 freight
 locomotive
 to
 improve


the
 aerodynamics
 but
 you
 can't
 because


they're
 like
 lego
 blocks
 they're
 hooked


up
 anywhere
 along
 the
 train
 you
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 the
 first
 one
 or
 the
 second


one
 or
 the
 third
 one
 here's
 a


scaled
 prototype
 showing
 a
 pattern
 that


we
 demonstrated
 on
 a
 freight
 locomotive


it
 folds
 up
 to
 be


very
 flat


but
 then
 deploys
 out
 and
 it
 turns
 out


our


computer
 models
 and
 wind
 tunnel
 testing


show
 that
 this
 will
 save
 this
 one


company
 multiple
 millions
 of
 dollars
 a


year
 in
 diesel


[Music]


this
 is
 a
 violinist
 it
 was
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 mechanism
 designs
 because


he
 fiddles
 if
 you
 pull
 his
 head


fantastic


functional
 motions
 of
 origami
 are


inspiring
 new
 designs
 for
 devices


like
 compliant
 mechanisms
 that
 can


complete
 full
 360
 degree
 rotations


unlike
 a
 traditional
 mechanisms
 with
 you


know
 bearings
 or
 hinges
 i
 can
 hook
 on
 a


motor
 and
 i
 can
 get
 continuous


revolution


i
 couldn't
 do
 that
 with
 a
 compliant


mechanism
 but
 it
 turns
 out
 no
 one


bothered
 to
 tell
 the
 paper
 folders
 that


and


created


a


uh
 continuously
 revolving
 compliant


mechanism


which
 is
 called
 a
 kalita
 cycle


origami
 motions
 are
 also
 being
 used
 in


medical
 devices
 these
 would
 be


you
 know
 the
 creases
 in
 the
 paper


uh


and
 we
 have
 here
 now
 uh
 forceps


and
 so
 what's
 nice
 about
 this
 is
 we


could
 put
 this
 at
 a
 smaller
 scale
 right


on
 the
 medical
 instrument
 to
 go
 into
 the


body


but
 then
 can
 morph


and
 become
 the
 gripper
 so
 it'll
 be
 very


small
 incision
 but
 then
 go
 in
 and
 do


some
 more
 complex
 tasks
 inside
 the
 body


a
 variant
 of
 this
 mini
 gripper
 is
 now


being
 used
 in
 robotic
 surgeries


replacing
 the
 previous
 mechanism
 and


reducing
 the
 number
 of
 parts
 by
 75


percent


the
 origami
 inspired
 device
 is
 smaller


but
 with
 a
 wider
 range
 of
 motion


and
 functional
 origami
 can
 be


miniaturized
 even
 further
 this
 is
 the


world's
 smallest
 origami
 flapping
 bird


that
 sounds
 cool
 this
 one
 was
 devoted


to
 developing


techniques
 to
 make


microscopic
 self-folding
 origami
 and


what
 you
 see
 here
 is
 a
 microscope
 photo


of
 the
 finished
 bird


but


what
 the
 bird
 actually
 looks
 like


well


i'll
 need
 my
 micro
 lens
 you'll
 probably


need


not
 just
 your
 macro
 lens
 you'll
 need


your
 microscope


because
 it's
 smaller
 than
 a
 grain
 of


salt
 so
 it
 started
 out
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 less


than
 a
 millimeter
 square


but
 when
 it's
 folded


it's
 much
 much
 smaller
 wow


now


you
 might
 ask
 yourself


what
 would
 anyone
 ever
 use


a
 microscopic
 flapping
 bird
 for
 and
 the


answer
 is
 well
 nothing
 for
 a
 flapping


bird


but


there
 are


medical
 devices
 medical
 applications


implants
 that
 are
 microscopic
 where
 you


might
 want
 a
 little
 machine


this
 is
 a
 nano
 injector


used
 in
 gene
 therapy
 to
 deliver
 dna
 to


cells


it's
 only
 four
 micrometers
 thick


so
 400
 of
 them
 can
 fit
 onto
 a
 one


centimeter
 wide
 computer
 chip


there's
 some
 things
 down
 there
 that
 kind


of
 look
 about
 star
 wars
 to
 me
 yes
 this


art
 called
 elliptic
 infinity


and
 we
 wanted
 to
 do
 that
 in
 a
 material


other
 than
 paper


you
 see
 this


from
 flat


into
 that
 elliptic
 infinity
 shape
 this


is
 actually
 a
 lamp


that's
 made
 from
 a
 single
 sheet
 so
 it


comes
 in
 an
 envelope
 like
 this
 put
 its


cable
 in


fold
 it


add
 a
 clip


now
 this
 relies
 on


a
 lot
 of
 math
 the
 curvature
 of
 these


lines
 affects
 links


the
 bending
 and
 curvature
 here
 to
 here


to
 here
 all
 of
 these
 are
 coupled
 and


pretty
 much
 the
 only
 way
 to
 design
 them


and
 get
 all
 the
 folds
 to
 play
 together


is
 by
 following
 mathematical
 methods
 my


professional
 background
 is
 mathematics


and
 physics
 i
 i
 did
 laser
 physics
 for
 15


years
 as
 a
 profession
 i
 got
 my
 phd
 in


applied
 physics


and
 my
 kind
 of
 my
 job
 in
 many
 cases
 was


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 describe


lasers
 mathematically
 and
 if
 i
 could
 put


my
 problem
 in
 the
 mathematical
 language


then
 i
 could
 rely
 on
 the
 tools
 of


mathematics


to
 solve
 those
 problems
 and
 to


accomplish
 the
 goals
 but


i
 also
 felt
 like


origami
 would
 be
 amenable
 to
 that
 same


approach


so
 i
 started
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to


describe
 origami
 using
 the
 tools
 of


mathematics
 and
 that
 worked
 i'm
 sort
 of


fascinated
 about
 the
 math
 here


like


it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 conceive
 of
 like


what
 does
 that
 math
 look
 like
 the
 math


comes
 down


to
 uh
 a
 way
 of
 representing
 a
 design


called
 a
 crease
 pattern
 let
 me
 grab
 a


couple
 of
 crease
 patterns
 okay


so
 this
 is
 an
 origami
 crease
 pattern


it's
 a
 plan


for
 how
 to
 fold
 in
 this
 case
 how
 to
 fold


a
 scorpion
 a
 really
 good
 way


of
 designing
 something
 like
 this
 is
 to


represent


every
 feature


claw
 leg
 tail


by
 a
 circular


region
 a
 circular
 shape


it's
 not
 circular
 folds
 it's
 an
 abstract


it's
 an
 abstract
 concept
 that
 you


represent
 the
 pattern
 by
 a
 circle
 but


then
 you
 find
 an
 arrangement
 of
 those


circles
 on
 the
 square


like


packing


balls
 into
 a
 box


so


for
 the
 scorpion
 you've
 got
 a
 long
 tail


imagine
 a
 big
 circle
 like
 a
 big
 tin
 can


and
 the
 legs
 are
 smaller
 circles
 or


circles
 of
 different
 sizes
 so
 you've
 got


different
 smaller
 cans
 and
 the
 claws
 are


a
 couple
 more
 circles
 and
 you're
 going


to
 put
 them
 into
 a
 square
 box


in
 such
 a
 way
 that
 they
 all
 fit


so
 you
 pack
 the
 circles


into
 the
 box
 and


the
 arrangement
 of
 those
 circles


tells
 you
 the


the
 skeleton
 of
 the
 crease
 pattern
 and


and
 from
 that
 you
 can
 geometrically


construct
 all
 the
 crease
 patterns
 you


follow
 rules


put
 a
 line
 between
 the
 center
 of
 every


pair
 of
 circles


um


and
 then
 whenever
 any
 two
 lines
 meet
 in


a
 v


you
 add
 a
 fold
 halfway
 in
 between
 it's


called
 a
 ridge
 fold


and
 there's
 similar
 more
 complicated


rules
 for
 adding
 more
 and
 more
 lines
 but


the
 thing
 is
 it's
 all
 step
 by
 step
 it


says
 it


if
 you
 find
 this
 geometric
 pattern
 that


tells
 you
 where
 to
 add
 the
 next
 line
 and


you
 go
 through
 that
 process
 until
 you've


constructed
 all
 the
 lines
 and
 when


you're
 done
 you
 can
 take
 away
 the


circles


they
 were
 the
 scaffolding
 for
 your


pattern
 and
 the
 pattern
 of
 lines
 that's


left


is
 the
 are
 the
 folds
 you
 need
 to
 create


the
 shape
 and
 that's
 what's
 shown
 here


and
 this
 was
 probably
 the
 biggest


revolution


in


the
 world
 of
 origami
 design
 was
 if
 you


followed
 that
 systematic
 process


the
 fold
 pattern


would
 give
 you


the
 exact
 shape
 that
 you
 set
 out
 to
 fold


to
 begin
 with
 the
 circle
 packing
 method


that
 i
 described
 this
 works
 for
 anything


that
 can
 be
 represented


as
 a
 stick
 figure
 like
 a
 scorpion
 you


could
 draw
 this
 as
 a
 stick
 figure
 with
 a


line
 for
 the
 body
 and
 tail


lines
 for
 each
 of
 the
 legs
 lines
 for
 the


claws
 and
 from
 that
 stick
 figure


from
 any
 stick
 figure
 you
 can
 use
 circle


packing
 and
 get
 a
 shape
 that
 folds
 it


but
 suppose
 the
 thing
 you're
 folding
 is


not


a
 stick
 figure
 suppose
 it's
 something


that's
 more
 like
 a
 surface


like
 a
 sphere


or
 you
 know
 or
 a
 cloud
 or
 or
 just
 in


animal
 terms
 a
 big
 blobby
 body
 like
 an


elephant


stick
 figure
 algorithm
 is
 not
 going
 to


work
 but
 there
 are
 other
 algorithms
 for


that
 about
 10
 years
 ago
 a
 japanese


mathematician
 named


tomohiro
 tachi


developed


an
 algorithm
 that
 works
 for
 any
 surface


you
 give
 it
 a
 triangulated
 surface
 as
 a


mathematical
 description
 and
 he
 will


give
 you
 or
 his
 algorithm
 will
 give
 you


the
 folding
 pattern
 that
 folds
 into
 that


surface
 it's
 now
 quite
 famous
 and
 it's


called
 origamizer


and
 that
 is
 a
 way
 you
 could
 make


a
 sheet
 of
 anything


and
 take
 on
 any
 three-dimensional
 shape


so
 origami
 is
 useful
 in
 engineering


because
 it
 provides
 a
 method
 of
 taking
 a


flat
 sheet
 of
 material
 and
 forming
 it


into
 virtually
 any
 shape
 by
 folding


or
 if
 the
 end
 product
 is
 flat
 origami


offers
 a
 way
 to
 reduce
 its
 dimensions


while
 still
 deploying
 easily


the
 simple
 act
 of
 folding
 can
 increase


rigidity


or
 origami
 can
 take
 advantage
 of
 the


flexibility
 of
 materials
 to
 create


specific
 motions


and
 its
 principles
 are
 scalable
 enabling


the
 miniaturization
 of
 devices


perhaps
 most
 of
 all
 origami
 allows


engineers
 to
 piggyback
 on
 the
 bright


ideas
 people
 have
 had
 over
 the
 centuries


while
 experimenting
 with
 folding
 paper


but
 translating
 these
 ideas
 into


practical
 solutions
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


math
 modeling
 and
 experimentation


hey
 this
 episode
 of
 veritasium
 was


supported
 by
 viewers
 like
 you
 on
 patreon


and
 by
 audible
 you
 know
 i'm
 about
 to


take
 a
 trip
 to
 australia
 with
 the
 whole


family
 and
 on
 that
 long
 flight
 if


everything
 is
 going
 well
 i'll
 be


listening
 to
 audible
 the
 book
 i
 am
 into


at
 the
 moment
 is
 narrative
 economics
 how


stories
 go
 viral
 and
 drive
 major


economic
 events
 by
 robert
 schiller
 he
 is


a
 nobel
 prize-winning
 economist
 and
 also


the
 author
 of
 irrational
 exuberance
 now


outside
 of
 the
 natural
 sciences
 i
 really


enjoy
 learning
 about
 economics
 because


it
 explains
 so
 much
 of
 what
 is
 happening


in
 the
 world
 around
 us
 for
 example
 this


book
 starts
 off
 by
 addressing
 the


phenomenon
 of
 bitcoin
 and
 schiller's


central
 thesis
 is
 that
 in
 addition
 to


all
 the
 traditional
 factors
 thought
 to


affect
 the
 economy


it
 is
 the
 narratives
 that
 go
 viral
 the


stories
 that
 take
 hold
 that
 are


instrumental
 in
 determining
 human


behavior
 and
 therefore
 economic
 outcomes
