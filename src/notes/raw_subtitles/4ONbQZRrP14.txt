While
 tech
 giants
 across
 the
 US,
 Canada,


Germany,
 and
 Switzerland
 hammered
 their


talent
 through
 mass
 layoffs
 and


struggled
 with
 pandemic
 aftershocks,
 one


European
 market
 quietly
 defied
 the
 chaos


and
 did
 things
 differently.
 The


Netherlands.
 Not
 dramatically
 better,


just
 differently.
 But
 here
 is
 where
 it


gets
 really
 interesting.
 In
 a
 country
 of


just
 17.9
 million
 people,
 they're
 facing


a
 projected
 shortage
 of
 1.4
 million


workers
 by
 2030.
 That's
 nearly
 8%
 of


their
 entire
 population.
 The
 Dutch


market
 created
 some
 unusual
 dynamics.


Fang
 layoffs
 barely
 touched
 the


Netherlands.
 Housing
 costs
 are
 pushing


away
 the
 very
 talent
 they
 need,
 and
 tax


salaries
 are
 slowly
 climbing
 while
 the


rest
 of
 Europe
 is
 stagnating.
 By
 the
 end


of
 this
 deep
 dive,
 you'll
 understand
 for


yourself
 whether
 the
 Dutch
 model
 is


sustainable
 and
 whether
 it's
 worth
 it


for
 you
 in
 2025
 for
 a
 tech
 career.
 This


is
 episode
 9
 of
 my
 series,
 Where
 to
 Run.


And
 on
 today's
 episode,
 we've
 got
 the


Netherlands.
 Please

 and
 give


us
 a
 thumbs
 up.
 We're
 working
 very
 hard


to
 deliver
 the
 most
 accurate
 and
 honest


information
 about
 the
 tech
 market
 in


2025.
 This
 video
 series
 is
 for
 tech


professionals
 already
 living
 and
 working


in
 the
 US,
 Canada,
 the
 UK,
 or
 the


European
 Union.
 If
 you're
 based
 outside


these
 regions
 or
 in
 an
 outsourcing
 heavy


market,
 the
 data
 in
 this
 video
 will
 not


apply
 to
 your
 situation.
 I
 do
 not
 cover


immigration,
 international
 job
 hunting,


or
 topics
 like
 how
 to
 break
 into
 tech


without
 a
 college
 degree.
 If
 that's
 what


you're
 here
 for,
 this
 probably
 isn't
 the


right
 channel
 and
 that's
 okay.
 But
 if


you
 are
 operating
 within
 these
 markets,


keep
 watching.
 There's
 a
 lot
 ahead
 for


various
 seniority
 levels
 and
 career


tracks
 in
 tech.
 As
 always,
 tech
 scene


and
 culture.
 Let's
 start
 this
 episode
 by


highlighting
 the
 dynamics
 of
 growth
 and


investment
 in
 Dutch
 tech
 because
 that


will
 dictate
 how
 we
 will
 go
 through
 the


layoff
 data.
 The
 Dutch
 tech
 is
 strong
 in


deep
 tech
 fields
 such
 as
 artificial


intelligence,
 quantum
 computing,
 and


semiconductors.
 Deep
 tech
 startups
 now


make
 up
 12%
 of
 the
 Dutch
 ecosystem.
 And


this
 isn't
 higher
 when
 compared
 to
 the


UK,
 Germany,
 Switzerland,
 or
 France.
 But


Holland
 does
 have
 a
 relatively
 high


scale
 up
 ratio.
 35%
 of
 the
 Dutch
 deep


tech
 progressed
 to
 scale
 up
 status
 which


is
 significantly
 higher
 than
 others.
 The


Amsterdam's
 science
 park
 was
 recently


chosen
 as
 the
 site
 for
 a
 new
 EU
 quantum


computer.
 The
 Dutch
 tech
 companies
 got


â‚¬3.1
 billion
 euros
 in
 VC
 funding
 in


2024,
 which
 is
 a
 47%
 increase
 over
 2023,


opposing
 the
 European
 trend
 of
 declining


investment.
 As
 of
 2025,
 the
 Netherlands


is
 the
 Europe's
 fourth
 largest
 startup


hub
 behind
 Germany,
 UK,
 and
 France.
 At


the
 same
 time,
 the
 number
 of
 new


startups
 declined
 by
 23%
 in
 2024,
 and


Dutch
 investor
 participation
 in


latestage
 funding
 dropped,
 pushing
 local


startups
 to
 look
 abroad
 for
 growth


opportunities.
 I
 will
 make
 a
 separate


video
 about
 the
 VC
 situation
 in
 Europe


in
 the
 light
 of
 geopolitical
 and


political
 changes
 of
 the
 past
 2
 years.


But
 long
 story
 short,
 the
 US
 is
 still


the
 land
 of
 dreams
 for
 tech
 startups.


Whether
 you
 like
 what
 Trump
 is
 doing
 or


not,
 that
 trend
 has
 not
 changed.
 On
 to


the
 layoffs.
 Unlike
 the
 US,
 mass
 layoffs


are
 less
 common
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 due


to
 strict
 labor
 laws
 and
 employee


protection.
 Companies
 tend
 to
 manage


downturns
 by
 not
 renewing
 temporary


contracts
 rather
 than
 large-scale


firings.
 Now,
 it
 is
 worth
 noting
 that


there
 are
 examples
 of
 companies
 laying


off
 employees
 on
 permanent
 positions
 as


well
 despite
 labor
 laws,
 but
 this
 is


very
 rare.
 According
 to
 the
 information


that
 I
 found
 in
 local
 Dutch
 tech


communities,
 people
 say
 that
 unlawful


layoffs
 are
 rare
 because
 employees
 can


go
 and
 sue
 companies
 in
 court.
 And
 by


doing
 this,
 companies
 risk
 losing
 a
 lot


of
 money
 fighting
 in
 courts.
 Now,
 the


flip
 side
 of
 this
 coin
 is
 that
 the


companies
 now
 hire
 temporary
 contractors


to
 offset
 those
 risks.
 So,
 that's
 just


something
 worth
 noting
 for
 trends.


Nevertheless,
 the
 Dutch
 market
 remains


fairly
 healthy,
 as
 healthy
 as
 it
 can
 be


in
 these
 realities
 with
 a
 preference
 for


hiring
 freezes
 or
 gradual
 adjustments


rather
 than
 abrupt
 cuts.
 Let's
 look


closely
 at
 the
 layoff
 data
 of
 the
 past
 3


years.
 2022,
 the
 Netherlands
 largely


avoided
 the
 mass
 layoffs
 seen
 in
 the
 US


and
 other
 parts
 of
 Europe.
 Notable


cases,
 Message
 Bird,
 a
 Dutch
 company


that
 laid
 off
 31%
 of
 its
 staff,
 which
 is


about
 250
 employees
 in
 November
 2022.


And
 this
 is
 considered
 a
 high-profile


layoff
 case.
 Now,
 knowing
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 US,
 250
 does
 not
 seem


like
 a
 substantial
 figure
 at
 all.
 And
 to


be
 clear,
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 downplay
 the


significance
 of
 this.
 Even
 250
 people


means
 that
 250
 lives
 were
 changed
 as
 a


result
 of
 this.
 But
 please
 understand


where
 I'm
 coming
 from.
 In
 my
 career,
 I


have
 seen
 entire
 floors
 of
 people
 being


taken
 into
 a
 room
 with
 HR,
 leaving
 5


minutes
 later
 in
 tears,
 packing


everything
 they
 have
 in
 boxes
 and


leaving
 the
 building.
 So
 when
 I
 say
 that


250
 is
 low,
 it's
 only
 because
 I've
 seen


hundreds
 being
 laid
 off
 within
 single


companies.
 2023.
 For
 context,
 2023
 was


the
 worst
 year
 on
 record
 for
 global
 tech


layoffs
 with
 263,000


people
 laid
 off,
 which
 is
 59%
 higher


from
 2022.
 The
 Dutch
 market
 remained


relatively
 untouched
 by
 global


standards.
 Less
 than
 4%
 of
 software


developers
 surveyed
 in
 the
 Netherlands


were
 laid
 off
 compared
 to
 13.2%
 in
 the


rest
 of
 Europe.
 Now,
 the
 one
 thing
 that


got
 hit
 really
 hard
 was
 startups.


Startups
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 had
 a
 42%


increase
 in
 attrition
 rates,
 both


voluntary
 with
 employees
 choosing
 to


leave
 themselves
 and
 involuntary


departures
 compared
 to
 a
 10%
 increase


across
 Europe.
 But
 what
 is
 meant
 by


attrition
 in
 this
 case?
 In
 2022,
 there


was
 a
 sharp
 decline
 in
 VC
 activity


globally
 and
 the
 following
 year
 became


the
 worst
 year
 for
 startup
 funding
 in


nearly
 a
 decade.
 This
 combined
 with


macroeconomic
 factors,
 rising
 interest


rate
 to
 offset
 inflation,
 the
 war
 in


Ukraine
 and
 the
 global
 supply
 chain


disruptions
 that
 followed
 as
 well
 as
 the


pandemic
 market
 correction.
 That
 is
 what


I
 mean
 by
 attrition.
 The
 Dutch
 startups


moved
 from
 a
 growth
 at
 all
 costs


approach
 to
 a
 focus
 on
 profitability
 and


sustainability
 which
 always
 result
 in


slowdown
 and
 reduced
 hiring.
 The
 Dutch


startup
 hiring
 rates
 dropped
 by
 almost


50%
 in
 2023
 compared
 to
 a
 37.5
 drop


across
 Europe.
 So,
 like
 I
 said
 before,


the
 Dutch
 dealt
 with
 the
 crisis
 through


hiring
 freezes
 and
 termination
 of


contracts
 that
 they
 were
 able
 to
 legally


terminate
 or
 not
 continue,
 not
 layoffs.


And
 then
 2024
 and
 2025,
 the
 global
 tech


layoff
 wave
 continued
 with
 over
 150,000


jobs
 cut
 in
 2024
 and
 more
 than
 22,000


layoffs
 in
 the
 first
 5
 months
 of
 2025.


The
 Dutch,
 however,
 continued
 its
 trend


of
 low
 layoff
 rates.
 There
 were
 isolated


cases
 such
 as
 Amsterdam-based
 bird


laying
 off
 33%
 of
 its
 workforce,
 which


is
 about
 120
 employees
 in
 early
 2025.


But
 mass
 layoffs
 remained
 rare
 and
 the


overall
 labor
 market
 stayed
 tight
 with
 a


high
 job
 vacancy
 rate.
 The
 main


employment
 challenge
 for
 the
 Dutch
 tech


companies
 was
 not
 layoffs,
 but
 the


difficulty
 in
 hiring
 and
 retaining


skilled
 talent
 with
 56%
 of
 tech
 job


openings
 considered
 hard
 to
 fill.
 Now,


what's
 also
 very
 interesting
 is
 that


over
 the
 past
 2
 years,
 the
 number
 of


fang
 layoffs,
 specifically
 in
 the


Netherlands,
 has
 been
 extremely
 limited


with
 no
 large-scale
 or
 headline
 grabbing


cuts
 reported
 from
 Dutch
 offices.
 Yes,


Dutch
 teams
 and
 fang
 are
 modest
 in
 size,


but
 headcount
 is
 much
 lower
 than
 in
 the


UK,
 Germany,
 or
 Ireland.
 The
 Netherlands


is
 a
 location
 for
 logistics,
 sales,
 and


a
 very
 limited
 number
 of
 product
 roles.


It
 is
 not
 the
 primary
 engineering
 or
 R&D


center
 for
 fang
 in
 Europe.
 But
 there
 are


other
 countries
 in
 Europe
 where
 these


roles
 are
 dominant
 and
 they
 suffered
 a


lot
 more.
 For
 example,
 Spain,
 Belgium,


and
 Italy.
 The
 Dutch
 fang
 teams
 were


among
 the
 least
 affected
 by
 layoffs
 in


Europe
 in
 the
 past
 2
 years
 thanks
 to
 a


combination
 of
 robust
 labor
 protection


laws
 and
 smaller,
 less
 engineering
 heavy


local
 offices.
 So
 overall,
 the


Netherlands
 consistently
 avoided
 mass


tech
 layoffs
 seen
 in
 the
 US,
 UK,
 and


Germany.
 Layoffs
 in
 the
 Dutch
 tech
 have


been
 isolated
 and
 not
 systematic.


Attrition
 and
 hiring
 freezes
 have
 had
 a


larger
 impact
 than
 the
 layoffs


themselves.
 Onto
 the
 characteristics
 of


the
 Dutch
 tech.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 the


most
 prominent
 Dutch
 tech
 companies
 and


their
 global
 impact.
 ASML.


Semiconductors.
 Photoiththography.
 ASML


is
 the
 world's
 leading
 supplier
 of


photoiththography
 machines
 used
 in


semiconductor
 manufacturing.
 Its
 extreme


ultraviolet
 machines
 are
 essential
 for


producing
 the
 most
 advanced
 computer


chips.
 The
 company
 supplies
 all
 major


chip
 makers
 worldwide,
 including
 TSMC,


Samsung,
 and
 Intel
 145.
 Booking.com,


online
 travel
 and
 hospitality.
 I
 mean,


we
 all
 know
 what
 Booking
 is.
 It's


headquartered
 in
 Amsterdam.
 Booking.com


is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 largest
 online


travel
 platforms
 serving
 millions
 of


customers
 daily
 in
 over
 220
 countries.


Aden,
 Fintech,
 and
 Payments.
 Aden
 is
 a


global
 payment
 processing
 company


enabling
 seamless
 transactions
 from


major
 international
 brands
 like
 Uber,


Spotify,
 and
 Microsoft.
 Its
 unified


commerce
 platform
 supports
 payments
 in


almost
 every
 country,
 making
 it
 a


backbone
 for
 global
 e-commerce.
 Mali,


another
 fintech
 company.
 Mali
 is
 one
 of


Europe's
 fastest
 growing
 payment
 service


providers,
 supporting
 tens
 of
 thousands


of
 merchants
 with
 simple,
 scalable


payment
 solutions.
 Picnic
 online


groceries.
 Picnic
 has
 revolutionized


grocery
 delivery
 with
 its
 innovative


app-based
 electric
 vehicle-powered


logistics
 model
 and
 Fastend
 electric


vehicle
 charging
 infrastructure.
 Facet


operates
 a
 rapidly
 growing
 network
 of


fast
 charging
 stations
 for
 electric


vehicles
 across
 Europe.
 Onto
 the


outsourcing
 trends
 in
 Holland.
 Near


shoring
 is
 on
 the
 rise.
 40%
 of
 Dutch


organizations
 plan
 to
 increase


outsourcing
 with
 only
 6%
 expecting
 a


decrease
 and
 54%
 for
 seeing
 no
 change.


Nearshoring
 primarily
 to
 Eastern
 Europe


has
 become
 the
 most
 common
 model
 for
 IT


and
 customer
 service
 roles
 favored
 for


proximity,
 cultural
 similarities,
 and


time
 zone
 alignment.
 Traditional


offshoring,
 for
 example,
 South
 Asia
 is


expected
 to
 decline
 with
 organizations


preferring
 EU
 or
 near
 EU
 partners
 for


data
 security
 and
 regulatory
 reasons.


Now,
 what
 are
 the
 motivations
 for


outsourcing?
 Well,
 the
 main
 reason,
 the


most
 obvious
 one
 is
 cost
 savings,
 which


gives
 businesses
 the
 ability
 to
 focus
 on


core
 business
 functions.
 I'd
 like
 to
 add


here
 that
 even
 though
 Holland
 is
 known


to
 be
 a
 country
 where
 English
 is
 very


commonly
 spoken
 with
 the
 shift
 of
 local


rules
 towards
 business
 operational


technical
 leadership
 functions
 knowing


Dutch
 is
 a
 big
 asset.
 Outsourcing
 and


especially
 nearshoring
 helps
 Dutch


companies
 address
 acute
 local
 tech


talent
 shortages
 and
 optimize
 costs.


Automation
 and
 AI
 adoption
 have
 shifted


outsourcing
 from
 traditional
 call


centers
 to
 more
 IT
 data
 security
 and


digital
 service
 functions.
 quality
 of


talent.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 education
 and


then
 about
 the
 skill
 gaps.
 Digital


skills
 including
 media
 literacy
 and


cyber
 security
 are
 embedded
 in
 the


national
 curriculum
 for
 secondary
 school


onward.
 The
 Netherlands
 cyber
 security


strategy
 mandates
 continuous
 updates
 to


tech
 curricula
 at
 both
 primary
 and


secondary
 levels,
 ensuring
 that
 students


are
 introduced
 to
 early
 digital


competencies
 and
 emerging
 technologies.


I
 think
 such
 an
 early
 introduction
 to


tech
 for
 kids
 is
 fantastic.
 The
 Dutch


system
 includes
 14
 research
 universities


and
 34
 universities
 of
 applied
 sciences


with
 strong
 tech
 and
 engineering


programs.
 The
 higher
 education
 in
 the


Netherlands
 is
 more
 expensive
 than
 in


Germany
 and
 France
 but
 more
 affordable


than
 England
 and
 Scotland.
 The
 Delft


University
 of
 Technology
 or
 TU
 Delft


ranked
 number
 one
 globally
 for


engineering
 and
 technology
 by
 QS
 World


University
 Rankings
 2022
 and


consistently
 in
 the
 top
 20
 worldwide.


Actually
 here
 in
 Canada
 I
 worked
 with


folks
 who
 graduated
 TUD
 Delft
 and
 they


were
 very
 skilled
 all
 around.
 Einhovven


University
 of
 Technology
 or
 TU
 Einhovven


ranked
 number
 13
 globally
 for


engineering
 and
 technology
 and
 awarded


digital
 university
 of
 the
 year
 in
 2024.


University
 of
 Tuente
 and
 University
 of


Amsterdam
 home
 to
 cutting
 edge
 research


in
 nanotechnology,
 AI
 and
 medical


technology.
 They
 excel
 in
 AI,
 data


science
 and
 computational
 science
 with


high
 research
 output
 which
 is
 over
 24.9


million
 citations
 from
 640,000
 academic


papers
 in
 computer
 science.
 Now
 on
 to


the
 skill
 gaps.
 To
 me,
 this
 was
 a
 fairly


unexpected
 fact,
 but
 I
 found
 plenty
 of


data
 resources
 indicating
 a
 chronic


shortage
 of
 qualified
 tech
 professionals


in
 the
 Netherlands.
 To
 be
 honest,
 when
 I


saw
 it,
 I
 started
 questioning
 the


source,
 thinking
 that
 I
 misread


something.
 But
 then,
 as
 I
 started


reading,
 my
 eyes
 were
 opening
 wider
 and


wider
 because
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 Holland
 had


such
 interesting
 local
 trends.
 The
 labor


market
 scarcity
 is
 projected
 to
 triple


by
 2030,
 potentially
 resulting
 in
 a


shortage
 of
 1.4
 4
 million
 workers
 across


sectors
 with
 information
 technology


sector
 being
 affected
 the
 most.
 And


that's
 in
 a
 country
 with
 a
 17.9%


population.
 Meaning
 for
 them
 to
 fill
 the


gap,
 they
 need
 8%
 of
 the
 population
 to


get
 into
 tech.
 As
 of
 2025,
 the
 job


openings
 in
 the
 ICT
 in
 the
 information


technology
 and
 tech
 consistently


outnumber
 available
 workers.
 In
 2021,


there
 were
 26
 vacancies
 for
 every
 IT


worker
 in
 the
 Netherlands.
 The
 talent


shortage
 is
 not
 uniform
 across
 all


roles.
 It
 is
 particularly
 acute
 in


specific
 areas.
 Full
 stack
 devs,
 DevOps,


data
 engineering,
 data
 analytics,
 and


product
 engineering
 folks
 with
 expertise


in
 niches,
 fintech,
 food
 tech,
 and
 AI.


Not
 surprised.
 A
 very
 similar
 trend
 is


being
 seen
 in
 England
 and
 Switzerland.


You're
 welcome
 to
 check
 those
 episodes


as
 well.
 There's
 a
 paradox.
 Even
 though


the
 number
 of
 tech
 workers
 in
 the


Netherlands
 is
 growing
 by
 6.9%


year-over-year,
 nearly
 doubling
 over
 a


decade
 and
 projected
 to
 surpass
 1


million
 by
 2030,
 plenty
 of
 positions


still
 remain
 very
 difficult
 to
 find
 or


recruit.
 Scarcity
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 the


number
 of
 tech
 workers
 is
 small
 in


absolute
 terms.
 It
 means
 that
 there
 is


still
 more
 open
 positions
 than
 qualified


people
 to
 fill
 them.
 Holland
 ranks
 at


the
 bottom
 of
 the
 world
 89
 global


economies
 for
 ease
 of
 finding
 qualified


personnel
 and
 is
 considered
 to
 be
 one
 of


the
 hardest
 places
 to
 find
 talent.
 The


postings
 that
 require
 only
 English


dropped.
 This
 combined
 with
 a
 severe


housing
 shortage
 in
 tech
 hubs
 makes
 it


harder
 for
 foreign
 professionals
 to


relocate
 and
 stay.
 The
 vibe
 Holland


considering
 its
 location
 on
 the


continent
 takes
 something
 from
 different


tech
 cultures
 around
 it
 and
 it
 has
 a
 lot


of
 local
 and
 regional
 culture.
 It's


collaborative
 and
 flat.
 For
 those
 who


watch
 the
 Nordics
 episode,
 that's
 a
 huge


distinction
 of
 the
 Nordic
 sector.
 Work


life
 balance
 is
 everything.
 It's
 a
 very


European
 and
 also
 a
 very
 Dutch
 thing.


It's
 quite
 diverse
 and
 it
 offers
 a
 good


mix
 of
 professional
 and
 social
 life.
 Of


all
 the
 European
 countries
 outside
 of


England,
 I'd
 say
 Holland
 is
 the
 biggest


of
 networking,
 which
 reminds
 me


personally
 of
 North
 American
 culture


because
 a
 substantial
 percentage
 of
 jobs


is
 filled
 through
 networks
 and


connections.
 That's
 a
 very
 North


American
 thing.
 Events,
 meetups,
 and


conferences
 are
 very
 active
 and


accessible.
 Amsterdam
 hosts
 multiple


conferences
 and
 industry
 events.
 Go
 to


Amsterdam.
 It's
 a

 Cost
 of


living.
 Between
 2022
 and
 2025,
 the
 cost


of
 living
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 has
 risen


sharply
 with
 housing
 at
 the
 center
 of


these
 changes.
 Housing
 costs
 already


high
 by
 European
 standards
 soared


further,
 33.8%


above
 the
 EU
 average.
 And
 by
 2025,
 the


rent
 in
 cities
 like
 Amsterdam


skyrocketed.
 House
 prices
 hit
 new


records
 with
 an
 8.7
 increase
 in
 2024
 and


forecasted
 7%
 increase
 on
 top
 of
 that
 in


2025.
 Driven
 by
 a
 persistent
 housing


shortage,
 which
 is
 a
 European
 problem,


not
 specific
 to
 Holland.
 The
 lower


mortgage
 rates
 and
 higher
 household


incomes,
 meaning
 more
 people
 being
 able


to
 afford
 more
 expensive
 housing.
 But


the
 higher
 household
 income
 is
 primarily


concentrated
 in
 large
 tech
 hubs.
 Other


living
 costs
 also
 climbed.
 food
 and


non-alcoholic
 beverages,
 healthcare,


mandatory
 insurance,
 and
 transport,


making
 it
 the
 third
 largest
 expense


after
 housing
 and
 food.
 While
 economic


growth
 was
 modest
 and
 household
 finances


remained
 generally
 stable,
 the
 main


challenge
 for
 tech
 workers
 and
 newcomers


was
 the
 acute
 difficulty
 in
 finding


affordable
 quality
 housing
 in
 major


cities.
 A
 problem
 exacerbated
 by
 limited


new
 construction
 and
 high
 demand.


Overall,
 the
 Netherlands
 became
 an
 even


more
 expensive
 place
 to
 live,
 especially


in
 urban
 tech
 hubs
 with
 housing


affordability
 and
 availability
 as
 the


most
 pressing
 concern
 for
 residents.


Conclusion:
 The
 Dutch
 tech
 market
 in


2025
 is
 defined
 by
 both
 resilience
 and


clear
 structural
 challenges
 as
 it


navigates
 the
 post-pandemic,
 post


layoff,
 and
 AI
 first
 era.
 The
 ecosystem


demonstrated
 its
 strengths
 by
 securing


3.1
 billion
 in
 venture
 capital
 at
 the


time
 when
 most
 of
 Europe
 saw
 declining


investment.
 Deep
 tech,
 including
 AI,


quantum
 computing,
 and
 semiconductors,


now
 comprise
 a
 substantial
 chunk
 of
 the


Dutch
 tech
 landscape.
 So,
 when
 is


Holland
 a
 good
 idea?
 If
 you
 work
 in
 high


demand
 fields
 like
 AI,
 cloud
 computing,


data
 science,
 or
 deep
 tech.
 If
 you
 value


a
 flat,
 collaborative
 work
 culture
 with


strong
 work
 life
 balance
 with
 flexible


work
 options.
 If
 you're
 attracted
 by
 a


welcoming,
 diverse
 community
 with


frequent
 tech
 meetups,
 events,
 and


networking
 opportunities.
 If
 you
 want


strong
 employee
 benefits,
 including


amplification,
 professional
 development,


and
 relocation
 support
 for
 international


workers,
 the
 Netherlands
 might
 not
 be
 a


good
 idea
 for
 tech
 workers
 if
 you
 are


highly
 sensitive
 to
 cost
 of
 living.
 If


you
 prefer
 lower
 taxation
 as
 Dutch


income
 taxes
 are
 progressive
 and


substantial
 for
 high
 earners,
 and
 if


you're
 seeking
 rapid
 US-
 style
 startup


scaling
 or
 a
 move
 fast,
 break
 fast


culture.
 The
 Dutch
 approach
 is
 more


measured
 and
 consensus
 driven.
 If
 you


have
 founders
 ambitions
 and
 you
 want


easy
 earlystage
 startup
 funding
 as


recent
 years
 have
 seen
 a
 drop
 in
 early


stage
 investment
 and
 more
 cautious
 VC


landscape.
 If
 you
 need
 extremely
 fast


career
 progression
 or
 expect
 the
 fastest


possible
 salary
 growth.
 And
 that's
 a


wrap
 for
 Holland.
 As
 always,
 I
 hope
 this


was
 helpful
 and
 we'll
 see
 you
 in
 the


last
 episode
 of
 Where
 to
 Run.
 Till
 next


time.
 Bye.
