Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicola
 Tangen,
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund


and
 today
 I'm
 really
 thrilled
 to
 welcome


Yesp
 Burin,
 the
 CEO
 of
 IKEA.
 Now
 I
 as


you
 know
 runs
 this
 iconic
 blue
 and


yellow
 stores
 that
 had
 that
 have


transformed
 perhaps
 your
 living
 room
 but


for
 sure
 homes
 worldwide
 and
 they


brought
 a
 slice
 of
 Scandinavian
 design


to
 almost
 900
 million
 visitors
 every


year.
 Wow,
 that's
 quite
 something.
 Well,


that's
 quite
 something.
 Thank
 you
 for


the
 opportunity
 uh
 Nikolai
 to
 be
 part
 of


uh
 this
 uh
 incredible
 podcast
 and
 and


thank
 you
 for
 doing
 the
 commercial
 for


IKEA
 so
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 Yes.
 I
 would


love
 just
 to
 go
 uh
 visiting
 a
 store
 with


you.
 So
 can
 we
 just
 uh
 put
 on
 our


customer
 hat
 and
 let's
 go
 into
 any


store.
 So
 we
 enter
 the
 door.
 What
 is
 the


first
 thing
 we
 see?
 The
 first
 thing
 it's


actually
 it's
 interesting
 since
 I
 had


the
 pleasure
 uh
 to
 work
 very
 close
 to


Invampra
 our
 founder
 uh
 for
 many
 years


walking
 a
 store
 with
 him
 I
 realized
 that


there
 is
 nothing
 um
 left
 to
 chance
 so
 to


say.
 So
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 will


actually
 experience
 coming
 to
 IKEA
 is
 a


person.
 Um
 in
 a
 time
 of
 AI
 and
 digital


revolution,
 it
 could
 be
 quite


interesting
 that
 we
 believe
 that
 nothing


can
 replace
 that
 human
 uh
 first


impression
 when
 you
 somebody
 greets
 you.


Um
 and
 that
 somebody
 will
 also
 hand
 you


a
 bag
 which
 was
 Ingvar's
 of
 course


insight
 that
 if
 we
 hand
 out
 bags
 um
 you


will
 begin
 your
 shopping
 even
 sooner.
 So


that
 is
 both
 uh
 a
 friendly
 gesture
 and
 a


smart
 commercial
 uh
 trick
 from
 IKEA.
 And


these
 are
 not
 small
 bags.
 These
 are


pretty
 big
 ones,
 right?
 The
 blue
 the


blue
 ones.
 Well,
 the
 blue
 bags
 have
 um


uh
 we
 use
 the
 yellow
 bags
 when
 you
 are


inside
 the
 store
 and
 then
 you
 replace
 it


with
 blue
 when
 you
 when
 you
 leave.
 The


blue
 bags
 have
 become
 iconic
 and
 I
 think


in
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 households


they
 serve
 for
 moving
 things
 as
 laundry


bags
 and
 whatnot.
 Um
 uh
 I
 even
 know
 that


some
 of
 the
 professional
 tennis
 players


of
 the
 world
 use
 them
 when
 they
 go
 to


their
 center
 courts
 for
 games
 and
 so


forth.
 So
 it's
 an
 iconic
 IKEA
 product


for
 sure.
 Now
 what
 are
 some
 of the
 other


things
 that
 we
 should
 we
 should
 note?
 We


we
 go
 through
 this
 maze
 right
 at
 the


entrance.
 We
 we
 try
 to
 say
 a
 couple
 of


uh
 send
 a
 couple
 of
 messages.
 One


message
 is
 around
 food
 because
 um
 uh


typically
 our
 customers
 have
 traveled
 uh


from
 somewhere
 and
 we
 know
 for
 sure
 that


you
 don't
 make
 good
 business
 deals
 on
 an


empty
 stomach.
 So
 we
 want
 to
 promote
 the


opportunity
 to
 actually
 spend
 some
 time


in
 a
 restaurant.
 Uh
 you
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 if
 you
 bring
 your
 kids
 to


actually
 uh
 uh
 drop
 them
 off
 in
 the


small
 land
 area
 which
 is
 like
 the
 haven


for
 kids
 to
 play
 and
 have
 fun
 while


while
 the
 parents
 are
 looking
 for
 things


for
 the
 home.
 Uh
 you
 would
 definitely


see
 some
 inspiration
 around
 life
 at
 home


and
 home
 furnishing.
 uh
 you
 would
 see
 a


strong
 message
 around
 low
 price
 that
 we


would
 send
 and
 today
 these
 days
 you


would
 always
 uh
 see
 messages
 around
 how


we
 try
 to
 show
 up
 as
 a
 company
 in
 in


terms
 of
 being
 people
 and
 planet


positive
 and
 uh
 so
 around


sustainability.
 So
 these
 are
 some
 of
 the


messages.
 Now
 at
 the
 end
 you
 then
 have


some
 kind
 of
 shockingly
 cheap
 offer
 to


remind
 everybody
 before
 you
 leave
 that


you
 are
 super
 cheap.
 I
 guess
 I
 I
 I
 think


you're
 using
 amazing
 words
 here.


Shockingly,
 we
 we
 sometimes
 say
 uh
 uh


tapa
 undone
 predictive
 which
 means


breathtaking
 items.
 So
 we
 try
 to
 promote


um
 low
 price
 at
 the
 beginning
 but
 for


IKEA
 it's
 it's
 a
 an
 interesting
 thing


because
 um
 our
 job
 is
 not
 really
 to
 be


cheap.
 We
 we
 serve
 people
 with
 thin


wallets
 out
 there.
 What
 we
 always
 try
 to


say
 is
 a
 story
 about
 not
 only
 the
 low


price
 but
 how
 we
 made
 it,
 what
 are
 the


built-in
 sustainability
 around
 it,
 uh


the
 functions,
 the
 quality
 items
 and
 so


on.
 So,
 it's
 hopefully
 not
 just
 a
 good


offer,
 but
 actually
 a
 story
 around
 it.


How
 many
 meatballs
 do
 you
 sell
 a
 year?
 I


don't
 know.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 meatballs.
 We


We
 are
 one
 of
 the
 actually
 one
 of
 the


big
 u
 food
 um
 companies
 of
 the
 world.


It's
 interesting
 because
 I
 I
 recall
 back


in
 it
 must
 have
 been
 back
 in
 2013
 or
 14.


We
 took
 a
 look
 at
 ourselves
 when
 it


comes
 to
 food,
 which
 is
 a
 complimentary


part
 of
 our
 offer
 and
 not
 the
 primary


one.
 And
 we
 realized
 with
 the
 help
 of


some
 big
 organizations
 that
 we
 actually


have
 an
 quite
 auh
 food
 footprint
 both


when
 it
 comes
 to
 sales
 uh
 customers
 but


also
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh
 health
 aspects


and
 sustainability
 aspects.
 So
 I
 know


for
 a
 fact
 this
 was
 the
 starting
 point


for
 us
 to
 actually
 start
 the
 journey


towards
 also
 offering
 plant
 based
 more


healthy
 alternatives
 and
 so
 forth.
 Um


but
 we
 are
 probably
 the
 biggest
 seller


of
 meat
 bones
 in
 the
 world
 I
 would
 say.


I
 suspect
 now
 um
 affordable
 design
 for


everybody.
 It
 sounds
 pretty
 simple,


right?
 But
 um
 why
 has
 nobody
 managed
 to


replicate
 what
 you
 do?
 Well,
 I
 think


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 companies
 out


there
 who
 who
 try
 it.
 But
 I
 it's
 an


interesting
 question
 because
 um
 it
 is


definitely
 a
 very
 tricky
 uh
 task
 what


we're
 trying
 to
 achieve.
 So
 we
 have
 this


um
 formula
 of
 design
 which
 we
 call


democratic
 design.
 So
 that
 represents


five
 things.
 It
 represents
 function.
 So


at
 IKEA,
 we
 sort
 so
 to
 say
 committed
 to


do
 things
 functionally.
 Folding
 chairs,


storage
 units,
 things
 that
 truly
 work


for
 uh
 for
 people
 in
 in
 life
 at
 home,


not
 at least
 in
 small
 spaces.
 Um
 there's


a
 great
 commitment
 to
 quality
 where
 we


uh
 you
 know
 where
 we
 work
 uh
 through


understanding


uh
 true
 family's
 needs.
 We
 only
 sell


sofas
 with
 washable
 covers
 for
 instance


and
 so
 forth.
 So
 quality
 is
 the
 second


uh
 uh
 um
 dimension.
 The
 third
 dimension


or
 there
 is
 no
 real
 numbers
 to
 them
 but


a
 third
 dimension
 is
 about
 form
 where
 we


then
 have
 decided
 to
 take
 uh


Scandinavian
 look
 on
 things.
 So
 we
 do


have
 traditional
 things
 we
 do
 have
 more


modern
 things
 but
 we
 we
 have
 our


particular
 Scandinavian
 point
 of
 view
 on


how
 we
 think
 things
 should
 look
 like
 uh


typically
 quite
 simplistic.
 fourth


dimension
 sustainability
 which
 says
 a


lot
 about
 how
 the
 product
 was
 made
 uh
 in


relation
 to
 people
 and
 planet
 and
 then


you
 have
 all
 of
 these
 at
 a
 low
 price.
 So


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 is
 required
 is


definitely
 scale
 in
 order
 to
 so
 to
 say


achieve
 all
 these
 um
 um
 uh
 identities
 in


a
 product.
 Um
 but
 it
 requires
 a
 lot
 of


knowledge
 from
 an
 engineering
 point
 of


view
 to
 actually
 build
 things
 in
 a


smarter
 way.
 So
 again,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


competitors
 do
 do
 a
 good
 job,
 but
 IKEA


is
 dedicated
 for
 every
 product
 to
 try
 to


actually
 design
 it
 in
 a
 way
 to
 prove


that
 you
 don't
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 rich


to
 be
 smart.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 uh
 just
 spend


a
 few
 uh
 minutes
 on
 the
 products,
 how


many
 products
 do
 you
 typically
 have?
 So


we
 typically
 have
 some
 between
 some
 nine


and
 10,000
 products
 to
 offer
 in
 any


given
 market.
 And
 how
 many
 would
 be
 uh


there
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time?
 How


much
 do
 you
 change
 and
 how
 much
 would
 be


kind
 of
 evergreens?
 Well,
 we
 we
 actually


change
 about
 20%
 of
 our
 products


annually
 right
 now.
 I
 would
 say


approximately
 half
 of
 that
 would
 be


color
 updates
 of
 textiles
 or
 it
 might


even
 be
 you
 know
 products
 that
 we
 do
 we


learn
 things
 and
 we
 do
 improvements


technically
 quality
 wise
 and
 so
 forth


and
 then
 but
 at
 least
 10%
 will
 be
 uh


entirely
 new
 products
 at
 the
 same
 time.


And
 how
 many
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 uh
 totally


classic
 things
 like
 the
 billy
 bouquets


and
 so
 on
 what
 kind
 of
 how
 many
 of
 those


do
 you
 have?
 So
 in
 our
 range
 we
 have


approximately
 you
 can
 say
 20%
 of
 our


range
 would
 be
 top
 families
 as
 we
 call


them
 or
 key
 products
 in
 IKEA.
 Uh
 you're


right
 Billy
 is
 definitely
 one
 of
 the


longlasting
 uh
 products
 in
 IKEA.
 Um
 you


have
 clip
 uh
 you
 have
 armshare
 and
 you


have
 uh
 quite
 a
 number
 of
 storage
 units


as
 well.
 Uh
 we
 have
 our
 kitchen
 unit
 our


packs
 wardrobes
 and
 so
 on.
 Uh


nevertheless
 these
 products
 are
 also


updated.
 There
 are
 cali
 changes,
 there


are
 improvements
 to
 it.
 The
 PAX
 wardrobe


in
 IKEA,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 oldest


products,
 has
 recently
 been
 remade.
 So


instead
 of
 being
 two
 people
 for
 25


minutes
 to
 assemble
 a
 wardrobe,
 you
 can


actually
 click
 it
 together
 in
 5
 minutes.


Do
 you
 only
 have
 IKEA
 furniturees
 at


home?
 Now,
 now
 I
 start
 to
 sound
 like
 a


salesperson.
 I
 real
 but
 you
 learned
 me


in
 there.
 Uh,
 no,
 I
 don't
 only
 have
 IKA


products.
 I
 I
 have a
 lot
 of
 IKEA


products
 uh
 in
 in
 my
 home
 for
 sure,
 but


not
 only.
 Where
 did
 the
 uh
 concept
 of


flat
 pack
 uh
 furniture
 come
 about?
 Well,


it
 it's
 been
 argued
 who
 was
 the
 inventor


of
 the
 flat
 pack,
 but
 definitely
 this


goes
 way
 back
 to
 the
 early
 days
 of
 IKEA.


And
 um
 Ingar
 himself
 um
 and
 Gilis
 Lung,


one
 of
 the
 first
 designers,
 if
 not
 the


first
 actually
 designing
 IKEA.
 Um
 they


basically
 had
 a
 cocreation
 on
 a
 table
 um


a
 side
 table
 to
 a
 sofa
 where
 they


realized
 that
 if
 they
 could
 find
 a
 way


to
 take
 off
 the
 legs
 uh
 you
 would
 save


uh
 approximately
 80%
 of
 the
 air
 and


thereby
 drive
 down
 the
 prices.
 So
 this


product
 H
 called
 Levette
 is
 uh
 claimed


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 first
 if
 not
 the
 first


uh
 flatback
 product
 and
 still
 today
 it


is
 incredibly
 interesting
 because
 if
 you


look
 at
 what
 that
 does
 from
 a
 cost


perspective
 and
 a
 climate
 footpoint
 uh


uh
 point
 of
 view
 it's
 just
 an
 incredible


invention.
 Has
 a
 ever
 stolen
 a
 design?
 I


I
 wouldn't
 uh
 be
 able
 to
 answer
 that
 if


I
 look
 back
 uh
 earlier
 generations
 but


if
 you
 look
 at
 my
 own
 period
 at
 IKEA
 and


uh
 also
 being
 the
 leader
 of
 EKO
 Sweden


who
 is
 the
 design
 company
 I
 think
 we


pride
 ourselves
 to
 develop
 our
 own


designs.
 Of
 course
 we
 we
 will
 be


inspired
 of
 the
 you
 know
 of
 the
 the


different
 um
 trends
 of
 the
 time
 but
 we


are
 very
 careful
 to
 not
 copy
 anybody


else
 or
 infringe
 on
 anybody's
 rights
 and


I
 can't
 remember
 even
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 last
 decades
 any
 any


argument
 around
 that
 comprod
 um
 founded


IA
 in
 1943
 when
 he
 was
 17
 years
 old
 and


you
 worked
 with
 him
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time


right
 well
 I
 had
 the
 opportunity
 to
 work


as
 assistant
 to
 him
 starting
 in
 late
 99


for
 3
 years
 actually
 and
 then
 of
 course


uh
 ever
 since
 we
 became
 good
 friends
 and


I
 had
 the
 pleasure
 to
 work
 with
 him.
 How


would
 you
 describe
 him
 as
 a
 person


because
 he
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 what
 should
 we


say
 a
 fairy
 tale
 type
 of
 figure
 in


Sweden?
 Right.
 Well,
 he
 was
 a
 very


special
 person.
 When
 I
 when
 I
 started
 as


um
 his
 assistant,
 I
 I
 didn't
 really
 know


him
 that
 well
 and
 what
 I
 found
 um
 many


things
 I
 found
 interesting
 and
 one
 of


the
 things
 what
 is
 very
 authentic
 uh


person.
 So,
 as
 he
 told
 me
 his
 life


story,
 you
 know,
 he
 made
 a
 success
 in


his
 late
 30s.
 The
 company
 was
 growing.


He
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 only
 to


realize
 that
 for
 him
 the
 personal


success
 or
 the
 value
 of
 money
 had


actually
 quite
 little
 interest
 for
 him.


So
 he
 returned
 to
 his
 childhood
 um
 uh


style
 and
 his
 childhood
 principles
 which


was
 a
 person
 who
 lived
 quite
 the
 thrifty


life.
 He
 was
 very
 costconcious.
 I
 tried


to
 convince
 him
 to
 change
 his
 old
 Volvo


but
 he
 kept
 it
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 his
 life.


Today
 it's
 donated
 actually
 to
 the
 Volvo


Museum
 in
 Gatenburg.
 Uh
 and
 as
 far
 as
 I


know
 it
 still
 runs.
 Um
 he
 was
 um
 uh
 he


was
 a
 true
 entrepreneur.
 He
 was
 um
 a


person
 with
 great
 vision.
 Uh
 he
 was
 not


so
 good
 at
 strategy.
 I
 would
 say
 he


skipped
 that
 part
 and
 he
 went
 straight


for
 actions
 on
 the
 store
 floor
 on
 the


factory
 floor
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 he
 just


that
 was
 the
 two
 places
 he
 loved
 to
 be.


He
 basically
 detested
 the
 boardrooms
 or


the
 committees
 and
 um
 for
 him
 life
 was


about
 the
 factory
 developing
 products
 uh


with
 people
 or
 the
 store
 making
 sure


that
 we
 make
 a
 better
 job
 for
 our


customers.
 Um
 it's
 interesting
 I
 suspect


that
 a
 lot
 of
 retail
 founders
 are
 a
 bit


the
 same
 way
 right
 obsessed
 about
 the


there
 are
 several
 people
 who
 have


similar
 uh
 philosophies
 as
 as
 he
 he
 had.


Um
 he
 was
 also
 of
 that
 generation
 who


basically
 understood
 how
 to
 scale


business
 and
 create
 value
 through
 scale


and
 IA
 was
 a
 master
 in
 that.
 How
 have


you
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 his
 uh


values
 are
 still
 present
 in
 the
 firm?


Well,
 I
 think
 he
 did
 a
 good
 job
 with
 the


values.
 The
 values
 in
 IKEA
 is
 not


something
 that
 comes
 as
 a
 communication


slogan
 afterwards
 but
 it's
 actually


integrate
 in
 into
 from
 the
 recruitment


to
 how
 we
 like
 to
 work.
 Um
 and
 it
 is
 in


it
 is
 interesting
 because
 the
 question


came
 when
 he
 passed
 away
 how
 we
 would


continue
 to
 maintain
 and
 develop
 the


culture
 and
 I've
 seen
 through
 the
 last


years
 you
 know
 that
 has
 been
 probably


the
 most
 difficult
 period
 for
 any
 one
 of


us
 in
 business
 like
 for
 yourself.
 Um
 we


have
 had
 pandemic
 war
 economic
 turmoil


trade
 war
 uh
 climate
 crisis.
 So
 these


have
 not
 been
 easy
 times.
 Um
 what
 I've


seen
 in
 IKEA
 is
 that
 we
 have
 been
 able


to
 do
 quite
 well
 maintain
 speed
 in
 the


company
 uh
 a
 lot
 thanks
 to
 the
 values


where
 people
 know
 that
 they
 are
 actually


mandated
 to
 take
 decisions
 and
 empower


themselves
 um
 and
 that
 we
 try
 to
 lead
 in


a
 humb
 style
 together.
 I
 believe
 Ringa


would
 have
 been
 proud
 if
 I've
 seen
 how


actually
 we
 are
 leading
 the
 company


today.
 One
 of the
 things
 you
 focus
 in
 a


lot
 on
 is
 sustainability
 and
 um
 whilst


some
 other
 companies
 have
 kind
 of


backtracked
 a
 bit
 here,
 you
 are
 really


holding
 the
 ground.
 Um
 why
 why
 are
 you


so
 convinced
 about
 this?
 Well,
 I
 think


to
 start
 with
 I
 think
 it's
 an


interesting
 divide
 in
 the
 world
 and
 and


I
 see
 more
 and
 more
 companies
 actually


being
 on
 the
 uh
 train
 ride
 to
 to
 become


climate
 smart.
 Um
 uh
 many
 of
 them
 might


not
 shout
 it
 out
 loudly.
 Many
 many
 think


that
 they
 are
 still
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


it.
 But
 I've
 uh
 interesting
 enough
 I've


seen
 uh
 also
 in
 the
 banking
 world
 and
 in


services
 uh
 in
 particular
 in
 US
 but
 also


in
 uh
 parts
 of
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world


where
 people
 have
 backtracked
 them
 which


I
 found
 interesting.
 Now
 in
 our
 case
 um


we
 took
 the
 decision
 to
 um
 to
 be
 a


leader
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh
 climate


smartness
 um
 actually
 even
 before
 the


Paris
 agreement
 was
 signed
 and
 we
 have


been
 a
 pioneer
 in
 figuring
 out
 both
 how


do
 you
 understand
 your
 impact
 how
 do
 you


measure
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 is
 called


scope
 3
 which
 means
 basically
 end
 to
 end


for
 the
 company
 and
 interesting
 enough


at
 this
 moment
 many
 years
 into
 the


climate
 work
 what
 we
 have
 found
 except


that
 It's
 good
 from
 an
 ethical


perspective
 because
 we
 like
 to


contribute
 from
 a
 moral
 standpoint.
 Um


it
 is
 uh
 something
 that
 has
 strengthen


IKEA's
 brand
 massively.
 We
 have
 data


points
 that
 shows
 across
 all
 of
 the


world
 how
 important
 this
 is
 for
 people.


And
 here
 comes
 the
 most
 interesting
 part


of
 them
 all.
 Maybe
 Nikolai
 a
 lot
 of


people
 think
 that
 the
 climate


transformation
 would
 come
 at
 a
 extra


high
 cost
 or
 at
 some
 so
 to
 say
 um
 uh
 as


a
 as
 a
 burden.
 What
 we
 have
 found
 out
 is


from
 raw
 material
 production,
 transport,


retailing
 all
 the
 way
 to
 customers
 that


it's
 actually
 uh
 helped
 us
 reduce
 our


cost
 and
 become
 a
 much
 uh
 smarter


financially
 uh
 set
 company
 for
 the


future.
 Because
 what
 is
 interesting
 is


if
 you
 ask
 people,
 they
 rate
 environment


very
 highly,
 but
 they
 are
 not
 really


very
 keen
 to
 pay
 extra
 for
 it,
 are
 they?


That
 that's
 right.
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


common
 misunderstandings
 with
 that
 which


I
 would
 subscribe
 to
 a
 while
 ago
 myself


uh
 there
 was
 a
 lady
 I
 met
 in
 um
 making
 a


home
 visit
 in
 Bgrade
 a
 couple
 of
 years


ago.
 She
 was
 a
 single
 mother,
 two
 kids,


uh
 two
 jobs.
 Uh
 we
 had
 a
 discussion


because
 she
 was
 passionate
 about
 uh


about
 environment.
 She
 she
 was
 very


fearful
 for
 climate
 change.
 Uh
 she
 saw


that
 all
 around
 and
 for
 her
 kids
 future.


And
 when
 I
 asked
 her
 if
 she
 was
 prepared


to
 pay
 extra
 for
 an
 IKEA
 product
 that


would
 be
 climate
 smart,
 she
 said
 no.
 And


then
 she
 explained
 to
 me,
 I
 don't
 have


the
 money.
 So
 I
 have
 two
 jobs.
 I
 have


two
 kids.
 My
 mother
 comes
 and
 help
 me


when
 they're
 back
 from
 school,
 etc.
 Do


you
 really
 expect
 me
 to
 pay?
 Um,
 and
 she


was
 very
 clear
 say,
 I
 expect
 you,
 yes,


and
 leaders
 like
 you
 and
 me,
 Nikolai,
 to


take
 our


responsibility.
 And
 I
 think
 she
 was


morally
 right.
 What
 I
 didn't
 know
 then


that
 she
 was
 actually
 financially
 right.


There
 is
 no
 need
 to
 pay
 extra
 for


sustainability.
 On
 the
 contrary,


everything
 we
 have
 done
 in
 IKEA
 um
 to


become
 climate
 smart
 has
 actually
 made


us
 save
 money.
 And
 when
 you
 think
 about


it,
 it's
 obvious
 because
 of
 course
 if


you
 use
 less
 material
 or
 material
 in
 a


smarter
 way
 or
 have
 the
 opportunity
 of


circular
 material,
 would
 that
 make
 you


more
 expensive
 or
 would
 it
 make
 you


lower?
 Of
 course,
 it's
 lower
 price.
 If


you
 implement
 renewable
 energy
 instead


of
 expensive
 uh
 um
 oil
 and
 gas,
 you


don't
 only
 get
 independence,
 you


actually
 of
 course
 get
 a
 lower
 energy


bill.
 Our
 energy
 bill
 in
 IKEA
 is
 29%


lower
 than
 before
 Paris
 agreement.
 And


then
 you
 continue
 step
 by
 step
 in
 the


value
 chain.
 And
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 always


that
 easy,
 it
 requires
 investments
 and


it
 requires
 that
 you
 take
 a
 big
 step


putting
 your
 whole
 scale
 behind
 it


otherwise
 you
 don't
 get
 the
 financial


benefits.
 you've
 taken
 all
 this
 uh
 one


more
 step
 forward
 to
 even
 uh
 have
 uh


creating
 a
 secondhand
 market
 for
 your


for
 your
 products.
 The
 secondhand
 part


uh
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 still
 a
 bit
 of
 um
 uh


test
 and
 trial
 from
 our
 side.
 It's
 u


very
 much
 appreciated
 by
 customers.
 If
 I


look
 at
 the
 total
 carbon
 footprint
 of


IKEA,
 it's
 not
 the
 thing
 that
 has


contributed
 the
 biggest
 uh
 carbon


reduction.
 Uh
 but
 we're
 on
 our
 way.
 So


what
 we
 do
 is
 we
 offer
 takeback
 service


to
 our
 stores.
 Um
 we
 do
 sell
 secondhand


furniture
 through
 our
 all
 our
 stores


globally
 and
 recently
 we
 have
 started
 to


engage
 in
 Norway
 in
 Spain
 and
 we
 are


intending
 to
 roll
 it
 out
 globally.
 We


have
 actually
 created
 our
 own
 secondhand


digital
 platform
 where
 then
 customers


can
 actually
 get
 uh
 an
 easier
 way
 to


sell
 their
 IKEA
 uh
 products
 um
 from


customer
 to
 customer.
 Very
 interesting.


Um,
 now
 you
 are
 known
 for
 these
 huge
 uh


stores
 outside
 cities,
 but
 you
 now
 have


opened
 a
 flagship
 store
 on
 London's


Oxford
 Street.


Um,
 tell
 me
 about
 it.
 Why
 why
 is
 this?
 I


think
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


investments
 we've
 done
 to
 be
 honest.
 So


hopefully
 uh
 it
 will
 work.
 It's
 it's
 an


interesting
 thing
 because
 um
 a
 few
 years


ago
 when
 we
 um
 when
 we
 started
 to
 deep


interview
 customers
 around
 the
 world
 um


this
 is
 actually
 before
 IKEA
 transformed


into
 omni
 channel
 and
 online
 at
 all
 back


then
 some
 8
 years
 ago
 we
 were
 more
 or


less
 only
 uh
 store-based.
 So
 when
 we


spoke
 to
 customers,
 they
 told
 us
 uh
 that


if
 you
 don't
 show
 up
 uh
 on
 an
 ordinary


workday
 when
 I
 put
 my
 kids
 to
 bed
 and


and
 uh
 I
 need
 something.
 If
 you
 don't


show
 up
 online
 in
 my
 phone
 or
 on
 my


laptop,
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 start
 to


deselect
 you.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 very


important
 message
 for
 us
 to
 hear
 from
 my


customers.
 The
 same
 customers
 often
 said


in
 particular
 the
 ones
 living
 in
 the
 uh


biggest
 cities
 or
 the
 metropolitan
 areas


of
 the
 world
 say
 we
 will
 go
 to
 IKEA
 in


Tokyo
 in
 London
 in
 York
 uh
 from
 time
 to


time
 but
 again
 if
 we
 if
 we
 don't
 have
 an


IKEA
 around
 the
 corner
 or
 10
 minutes


away
 we
 might
 choose
 somebody
 else
 so
 we


we
 began
 a
 journey
 uh
 of
 transforming


into
 online
 services
 the
 whole


logistical
 backbone
 of
 IKEA
 was


re-engineered
 And
 as
 a
 part
 of
 that
 you


can
 say
 the
 cream
 on
 top
 was
 that
 we


started
 to
 experiment
 with
 uh
 smaller


versions
 of
 IKEA
 in
 cities.
 Interesting


enough
 I
 think
 we
 made
 so
 many
 mistakes


and
 so
 many
 miscalculations
 on
 what
 we


thought
 customers
 in
 the
 city
 uh
 would


like
 to
 have.
 Um
 but
 seven
 years
 down


the
 road
 we've
 actually
 found
 a
 format


which
 is
 much
 like
 a
 big
 store.
 It's


just
 a
 bit
 smaller
 but
 you
 can
 actually


buy
 everything
 from
 IKEA.
 You
 can
 have


your
 meatballs
 and
 obviously
 you
 won't


be
 able
 to
 pick
 up
 your
 sofa
 from
 Oxford


Street,
 but
 you
 will
 be
 able
 to
 shop


everything
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 products
 you
 you


can
 take
 with
 you
 on
 the
 same
 day


actually.
 How
 is
 it
 working
 out?
 Well,


it's
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 in.
 It's
 u
 we
 are


running
 in
 the
 second
 week.
 It's
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 successes
 uh
 from
 an
 opening


point
 of
 view
 we
 had
 uh
 so
 far.
 So


already
 the
 first
 week
 it
 was
 the
 second


uh
 biggest
 store
 when
 it
 comes
 to


visitations
 uh
 in
 IKEA.
 And
 if
 you


compare
 that
 then
 to
 the
 big
 stores
 out


there,
 that
 has
 has
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 a


success.
 But
 we
 need
 to
 give
 it
 a
 year


um
 to
 see
 also
 that
 we
 manage
 um
 as
 well


when
 it
 come
 not
 only
 to
 attract
 people


but
 also
 financially.
 Well,
 for
 sure
 I


will
 check
 it
 out
 when
 I'm
 in
 London


next.
 It's
 a
 cool
 place.
 It
 has
 a
 couple


of
 extra
 spices
 to
 Nikki
 experience
 that


I
 think
 you
 will
 enjoy.
 Now
 how
 uh
 is


the
 geopolitical
 situation
 impacting
 how


you
 source
 and
 how
 you
 think
 about
 your


supply
 chain?
 Well,
 you
 can
 say
 for
 for


decades
 we
 were
 used
 I
 think
 in
 our


generation
 um
 um
 yearbyear
 um
 easier
 uh


to
 do
 multilateral
 uh
 deals
 um
 less


issues
 with
 borders.
 So
 we
 were
 sort
 so


to
 say
 I
 think
 taken
 for
 granted
 that


the
 pathway
 of
 uh
 collaboration
 around


trade
 would
 continue
 and
 then
 we
 find


ourselves
 in
 some
 10
 years
 back
 in
 a


much
 more
 challenging
 situation.
 I
 think


it's
 understandable
 the
 world
 is


changing
 um
 as
 I
 met
 somebody
 in
 Davos


in
 January
 who
 said
 that
 we
 we
 have
 left


one
 world
 order
 and
 we
 haven't
 yet


established
 a
 new
 one
 and
 times
 in


between
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 chaotic


and
 that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 today.
 So


obviously
 you
 can
 say
 it
 puts
 pressure


on
 companies
 in
 general
 and
 big


companies
 like
 IKEA
 find
 ourselves
 in


the
 interesting
 dilemma
 that
 way
 back


companies
 used
 to
 be
 quick
 and


government
 slow
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


speed
 of
 governments
 right
 now
 and
 not


for
 a
 good
 reason.
 It's
 difficult
 for
 us


as
 companies
 to
 to
 keep
 up.
 Um
 so
 what


we
 do
 we
 continue
 to
 invest
 um
 we


continue
 to
 think
 long
 term
 in
 our


markets.
 Um
 and
 basically
 we
 have
 to


mitigate
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 issues
 around


the
 trade
 restrictions
 and
 so
 on
 along


the
 way.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 Swedish


companies
 are
 so
 much
 more
 successful


than
 Norwegian
 companies
 in
 terms
 of


rolling
 rolling
 out
 internationally?


Well,
 is
 that
 so?
 I
 think
 uh
 well
 I


think
 we
 have
 had
 um
 a
 different
 uh


successes,
 right?
 I
 think
 Norway
 has


been
 incredibly
 successful
 in
 energy.
 uh


when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh
 uh
 companies
 like


Yara
 working
 with
 fertilization
 and
 so


on.
 So
 there
 are
 different
 things
 in


Norway
 with
 that
 is
 of
 course


phenomenal.
 Um
 uh
 Sweden
 has
 been
 good


in
 technology
 and
 in
 um
 with
 IKEA
 as
 one


of
 the
 leader
 but
 many
 more
 like
 H&M.
 I


I
 think
 maybe
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 that


Scandinavians
 in
 general
 are
 successful


is
 that
 we
 know
 that
 we're
 small.
 So
 in


order
 to
 be
 successful
 we
 have
 to
 be
 out


there.
 We
 have
 to
 adapt.
 We
 have
 to


understand
 different
 cultures
 and
 look


for
 opportunities
 and
 win-win.
 And
 I
 do


believe
 um
 as
 of
 today
 in
 this
 world,
 I


think
 Scandinavian
 companies
 and
 leaders


in
 general
 are
 um
 in
 the
 forefront
 of


looking
 for
 win-win
 solutions.
 You


mentioned
 technology.
 Tell
 us
 how
 you


think
 technology
 will
 shape
 IKEA
 going


forward.
 To
 start
 with,
 you
 can
 say
 uh


IKA
 was
 late
 in
 the
 digital
 um


revolution
 if
 you
 like.
 So
 basically
 uh


platform
 companies
 like
 Amazon
 and
 more


revolutionized
 retailing
 um
 you
 know
 for


good
 I
 would
 say
 and
 that
 revolution


started
 in
 the
 early
 2000s.
 IKEA


continued
 to
 be
 very
 successful
 with
 our


store
 formats
 and
 um
 with
 our
 business.


So
 it
 was
 first
 somewhere
 around
 2012
 14


15
 we
 started
 to
 see
 change
 behaviors


with
 our
 customers.
 So
 we
 were
 late
 on


that
 and
 as
 I
 referred
 to
 before
 we


decided
 to
 make
 the
 the
 online
 and
 the


omni
 channel
 transformation.
 Interesting


enough
 Nikolai
 um
 as
 we
 took
 that


decision
 we
 had
 no
 clue
 about
 the


pandemic
 that
 came
 a
 few
 years
 later.


Now
 thanks
 to
 us
 shifting
 to
 online
 it


actually
 saved
 the
 company
 during
 the


pandemic.
 We
 would
 have
 been
 in
 massive


red
 numbers
 in
 layoffs
 and
 in
 in
 a
 great


retraction
 of
 volumes
 and
 everything
 if


it
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 for
 the


opportunity
 to
 actually
 operate
 through


through
 online.
 So
 it
 gave
 us
 um
 a
 good


lesson
 I
 think
 to
 to
 uh
 keep
 your
 eyes


and
 ears
 open
 for
 the
 changes
 in
 the


world.
 So
 we
 see
 uh
 AI
 is
 uh
 coming
 big


and
 for
 us
 that's
 going
 to
 re


revolutionize
 and
 it's
 already
 in
 our


value
 chain
 revolutionizing
 uh
 goods


flow
 helping
 simplify
 and
 saving
 cost


through
 goods
 flow.
 It's
 helping
 our
 us


in
 customer
 service
 uh
 at
 scale.
 It's


helping
 us
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 home


planning
 how
 you
 actually
 uh
 serve
 your


customers
 in
 making
 um
 sense
 of
 home


planning
 in
 the
 future
 and
 probably
 it's


going
 to
 help
 us
 in
 many
 more
 ways
 that


we
 don't
 know
 today.
 your
 big
 blue


catalog
 was
 more
 ubiquitous
 than
 the


Bible
 uh
 in
 the
 Nordic
 region.
 Do
 you


still
 print
 it?
 Uh
 we
 we
 don't
 print
 the


catalog
 actually
 since
 a
 couple
 of
 years


back.
 There
 are
 a
 few
 markets
 I
 know


that
 keep
 it
 as
 an
 extra
 you
 can
 say


marketing
 injection
 but
 as
 we
 knew
 the


catalog
 as
 like
 um
 the
 foundation
 for


home
 furnishing,
 it
 started
 to
 lose
 its


um
 uh
 role
 when
 online
 came.
 So
 we
 at


the
 last
 years
 it
 was
 also
 just


observing
 to
 say
 that
 it
 was
 a
 waste
 of


resources.
 It
 was
 a
 waste
 of
 paper
 in


the
 end
 and
 we
 find
 other
 ways
 better


ways
 to
 engage
 with
 our
 customers.
 Yes.


But
 how
 would
 you
 define
 your
 leadership


style?
 Well
 I
 think
 from
 a
 leadership


perspective
 I
 think
 um
 I
 think
 I'm
 a


fairly
 good
 representative
 of
 the
 IKEA


values
 or
 at least
 some
 of
 them.
 So
 I


think
 people
 would
 describe
 me
 as
 u
 a


person
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 willpower
 but
 also


humbleness.
 I
 I'm
 an
 employee
 like


everybody
 else
 in
 in
 IKEA
 and
 um
 I
 think


um
 for
 me
 it's
 important
 to
 stay


grounded
 in
 reality.
 Um
 I
 worked
 with


Ingbar.
 I
 had
 the
 opportunity
 not
 only


to
 learn
 from
 him
 but
 also
 realize
 that


we
 shared
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 same
 viewpoints


of
 staying
 grounded
 with
 people
 out


there
 in
 our
 factories
 in
 our
 homes
 in


our
 stores.
 Um
 I
 get
 joy
 from
 that
 and


um
 I
 believe
 thereby
 also
 sometimes
 I


and
 we
 in
 IA
 find
 actually
 the
 pathway


to
 speed
 in
 in
 the
 future
 because
 we
 are


close
 to
 reality.
 What's
 the
 uh
 what's


the
 key
 to
 staying
 grounded?
 Well
 uh
 I


think
 happy
 marriage
 is
 number
 one
 and


stability
 uh
 uh
 in
 your
 life
 in
 general


I
 think
 is
 uh
 is
 required
 because
 today


to
 be
 a
 leader
 it
 requires
 you
 to
 be


agile.
 Um
 again
 we
 have
 seen
 crisis


after
 crisis
 you
 need
 to
 develop
 a
 way


of
 resilience
 in
 your
 life
 a
 way
 of


recharge
 uh
 a
 way
 of
 I
 think
 accepting


that
 in
 many
 ways
 you
 need
 to
 accept


dilemas
 and
 accept
 that
 you
 don't
 have


the
 answers
 but
 that
 you
 can
 be
 open


transparent
 authentic
 in
 your
 leadership


will
 allow
 you
 to
 actually
 collaborate


with
 people
 and
 hopefully
 do
 a
 better


job
 than
 if
 you
 are
 the
 know
 it
 all
 so


to
 say.
 You
 mentioned
 speed
 a
 couple
 of


times.
 How
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 EKI
 is


a
 speedy
 place
 and
 why
 sorry
 and
 why
 is


speed
 so
 important?
 Well,
 speed
 is


important.
 I
 think
 um
 agility
 and
 speed


is
 important
 because
 the
 world
 is


changing
 in
 a
 faster
 and
 faster
 uh
 way.


Uh
 we
 have
 seen
 that
 in
 technology.
 We


see
 that
 in
 politics
 and
 so
 forth.
 And


being
 a
 big
 company,
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 risks
 for
 us
 is
 that
 we
 are


too
 slow
 and
 too
 bureaucratic.
 And


obviously
 being
 part
 of
 a
 big
 system,


there
 is
 always
 um
 force
 of
 nature
 uh


that
 invites
 you
 to
 make
 things
 more


complicated.
 maybe
 hire
 a
 little
 bit
 too


many
 experts,
 uh
 too
 many
 meetings
 and


so
 on.
 So
 you
 need
 to
 constantly
 try
 to


cut
 down
 on
 meetings,
 uh
 encourage


people
 to
 take
 decisions,
 to
 take
 risks,


to
 dare
 to
 to
 do
 mistakes.
 Um
 IKEA
 was


never
 there,
 right?
 It
 was
 developed


year
 by
 year
 by
 people
 who
 had
 the


courage
 to
 to
 take
 those
 risks.
 So
 I


think
 the
 biggest
 threat
 today
 for
 us


beside
 things
 like
 climate
 change,


economic
 turmoil
 would
 be
 our
 internal


capability
 to
 actually
 be
 entrepreneurs.


How
 do
 you
 encourage
 people
 to
 take


risks?
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 it's
 by
 definition


a
 risky
 business.
 Well,
 I
 try
 to
 be
 a


good
 example
 myself
 and
 do
 mistakes.
 Um


but
 I
 What's
 the
 biggest
 mistake
 you


ever
 made?
 Well,
 I
 I
 Where
 should
 we


begin?
 I
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 last


part
 um
 if
 if
 we
 say
 the
 definition
 of


mistake
 is
 that
 you
 have
 acted
 on
 a


problem
 but
 didn't
 find
 the
 right


solution
 if
 you
 say
 like
 that
 and
 I


think
 the
 last
 years
 we
 have
 been
 more


entrepreneurial
 than
 in
 a
 very
 long
 time


in
 particular
 when
 it
 comes
 to


transformation
 of
 retail
 so
 we
 have


invested
 both
 digitally
 and
 uh


physically
 in
 as
 we
 spoke
 about
 city


stores
 and
 other
 things
 that
 simply


didn't
 work
 in
 the
 beginning
 um
 but
 By


having
 that
 spirit
 and
 not
 just
 working


linearly
 but
 actually
 iterate
 a
 lot
 of


different
 tests
 and
 trials
 you
 you
 will


be
 faster
 in
 finding
 the
 pathway
 to
 the


future.
 So
 how
 do
 I
 encourage
 people?


Well,
 I
 have
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


techniques
 is
 I
 have
 a
 banana
 card
 and


the
 banana
 card
 was
 actually
 invented
 in


a
 dialogue
 with
 uh
 a
 big
 group
 of
 IKEA


colleagues
 who
 said
 openly
 that
 I
 we


feel
 sometimes
 afraid
 of
 daring
 to
 make


mistakes.
 What
 would
 be
 the


consequences?
 So,
 I
 invented
 this
 card


where
 where
 I
 basically
 co-sign
 uh
 in


advance
 for
 your
 mistake
 and
 I've
 handed


that
 out
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 I


actually
 do
 follow
 up
 with
 everyone
 who


I
 handed
 this
 card
 to
 but
 more
 as
 an


encouragement
 to
 say
 if
 you
 do
 a
 mistake


and
 you
 look
 for
 somebody
 to
 share
 that


burden
 with
 you
 can
 count
 on
 me
 and


obviously
 symbolically
 to
 say
 don't
 wait


with
 acting
 on
 your
 ideas.
 If
 you
 have


an
 idea
 and
 you
 don't
 act
 on
 it,
 it's


not
 only
 that
 we
 miss
 the
 opportunity
 of


uh
 of
 learning
 but
 I
 think
 people
 who


don't
 act
 on
 ideas
 slowly
 and
 gradually


uh
 there's
 something
 dying
 inside
 you


know
 if
 you
 give
 up
 on
 acting
 on
 your


ideas
 and
 for
 us
 it's
 important
 to
 be
 a


live
 community
 of
 people
 who
 who
 go
 for


their
 ideas
 and
 continue
 to
 look
 for
 the


next
 horizon.
 Um
 yes
 but
 you
 you
 talked


about
 um
 recharging
 and
 uh
 and
 so
 on.
 I


get
 her
 that
 you
 are
 uh
 also
 a
 rock


star.
 No,
 that
 that
 in
 that
 case
 you


have
 been
 totally
 misinformed.
 I
 like


rock
 music
 though
 and
 you
 play
 rock.
 You


play
 in
 a
 band,
 right?
 I
 I
 do.
 I
 do.


I've
 always
 done
 actually.


Lord
 Beaverbrock.
 Yeah,
 that
 is
 the


recent
 uh
 band.
 That's
 correct.
 So,
 we


are
 going
 to
 play
 a
 song
 here,
 but
 not


uh
 not
 on
 air,
 but
 we'll
 we'll
 cut
 it
 in


afterwards.
 Which
 one
 should
 we
 put
 in?


I
 think
 you
 could
 actually
 play
 uh
 said


generation.
 It's
 a
 tribute
 to
 the
 young


youth
 out
 there
 who's
 actually
 working


as
 activist
 in
 the
 interest
 of
 our
 and


next
 generation.
 Fantastic.
 Let's
 uh


let's
 listen.


[Music]


the
 world
 for
 you
 and


what
 does
 music
 do
 to
 you
 as
 a
 person
 as


a
 human
 being?
 Well,
 I've
 always
 been


interested
 um
 of
 music
 uh
 since
 I
 was
 um


I
 think
 12
 13
 years.
 Uh
 to
 be honest,


the
 the
 first
 interest
 in
 music
 was
 I


noticed
 that
 if
 I
 learned
 to
 play
 the


guitar
 and
 sing
 um
 I
 was
 more


lucky
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 competition


of
 girlfriends
 and
 parties
 and
 other


things.
 So,
 I
 I
 had
 a
 a
 thought
 about


it.
 that
 my
 musical
 interest
 developed


into
 new
 uh
 areas
 along
 the
 way.
 Do
 you


think
 that
 do
 you
 think
 that's
 why
 do


you
 think
 that's
 why
 people
 start
 in
 pop


groups
 generally
 yet?
 Probably
 below
 the


age
 of
 20
 I
 would
 I
 would
 guess
 that
 80%


of
 them
 have
 less
 interest
 in
 music.


That's
 just
 my
 opinion.
 So
 um
 but
 in
 any


case
 I
 I
 for
 me
 to
 be
 serious
 I
 think


music
 is
 a
 way
 of
 relaxing.
 So,
 uh,


after
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 tough
 day
 at
 work


or
 a
 tough
 week,
 if
 I
 get
 one
 hour
 with


my
 electric
 guitar
 and,
 um,
 to
 play
 a


little
 bit,
 that's,
 uh,
 super
 relaxing.


It's
 like
 totally
 disconnecting.
 It's
 a


bit
 of,
 uh,
 meditation
 for
 me
 because


you
 can't
 do
 that
 and
 have
 other


thoughts
 in
 your
 head.
 So,
 it's
 a
 way
 to


clean
 your
 mind
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 it's


also
 incredibly
 fun
 to
 play
 with
 others.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Do
 you
 think
 it
 does


anything
 to
 your
 leadership?
 Well,
 I
 I


think
 all
 of
 us
 need
 to
 have
 our
 channel


of
 um
 uh
 recharging
 and
 for
 me
 music
 is


definitely
 one
 of
 them.
 Um
 and
 writing


music,
 writing
 lyrics,
 writing
 music
 uh


gives
 me
 so
 to
 say
 another
 dimension
 to


life
 and
 um
 it
 opens
 up
 to
 many
 other


dimensions
 as
 well.
 And
 of
 course
 as
 a


hobby
 um
 to
 have
 the
 opportunity
 to
 meet


the
 band
 uh
 to
 record
 in
 a
 studio
 to


focus
 on
 something
 totally
 different


gives
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 recharging
 of


batteries
 for
 for
 what
 I
 do
 at
 work.
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important.
 And
 I
 think


if
 you
 have
 something
 outside
 work
 which


you
 really
 are
 passionate
 about,
 it


makes
 it
 easier
 to
 cope
 with
 stress,


easier
 to
 um
 you
 know
 think
 about
 other


things,
 makes
 you
 a
 more
 interesting


person,
 more
 fun
 also
 that
 in
 the
 roles


that
 we
 have
 also
 leading
 as
 CEOs
 of
 big


organization
 and
 companies,
 you
 can
 get


trapped
 in
 your
 own
 rabbit
 hole
 of
 your


own
 importance,
 but
 also
 you
 can
 get


stuck
 in
 your
 problems
 and
 and
 also
 even


in
 the
 worst
 case
 um
 the
 myth
 that
 if


you
 gear
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 extra
 and
 work


longer
 hours
 would
 be
 the
 sleep
 less


etc.
 that
 that
 would
 be
 the
 pathway
 to


success
 and
 obviously
 it's
 the
 opposite.


You
 need
 to
 find
 ways
 to
 to
 broaden
 your


perspective
 and
 recharge.
 Looking
 at


your
 journey
 at
 IKEA,
 what
 are
 you
 the


most
 proud
 of?
 Well,
 like
 a
 couple
 of


things.
 Um
 sometimes
 it's
 um
 it
 can
 be


details,
 great
 products
 I've
 been
 part


of
 um
 developing
 and
 so
 on.
 But
 if
 I


take
 any
 area
 I
 think
 it
 is
 uh
 starting


in
 95
 in
 IKEA
 in
 Pakistan
 Karachi


Pakistan
 was
 my
 first
 assignment.
 Um


these
 were
 the
 days
 when
 IKEA
 was


looking
 at
 sourcing
 uh
 opportunities


outside
 Europe.
 So
 uh
 I
 was
 uh
 put
 there


to
 build
 up
 uh
 sourcing
 of
 textiles.
 I


did
 it
 was
 an
 incredible
 success
 in
 many


ways
 from
 my
 business
 growth.
 But
 it
 was


also
 the
 first
 time
 at
 IKEA
 when
 we


started
 to
 confront
 ourselves
 to
 say
 do


we
 need
 to
 bring
 our
 values
 to
 our


supply
 chain
 as
 well
 or
 is
 it
 enough
 if


we
 apply
 them
 on
 our
 on
 our
 own
 offices


or
 communities.
 Um
 and
 in
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 we
 so
 to
 say
 came
 to
 the
 conclusion


that
 we
 have
 to
 be
 a
 leader
 when
 it


comes
 to
 environmental
 aspects
 and


social
 aspects
 and
 that
 goes
 for


everything
 we
 do
 in
 our
 value
 chain.
 I


was
 part
 of
 developing
 that
 in
 Asia
 uh


as
 a
 young
 leader
 and
 except
 for
 knowing


how
 well
 it
 works
 today
 and
 what
 that


has
 meant
 uh
 environmentally
 but
 also


socially
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 uh
 I
 found


incredible
 joy
 to
 know
 that
 it's
 helped


IA
 to
 strengthen
 its
 finances.
 So
 to
 be


a
 good
 business
 is
 actually
 also
 uh


helpful
 when
 doing
 good
 business.
 What


is
 your
 favorite
 EK
 furniture
 or
 uh


product
 that
 you
 sell?
 the
 kitchen


department
 for
 six
 years.
 So,
 uh


kitchens
 is
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 the
 most


complex
 product
 in
 a
 care
 because
 it's


part
 of
 a
 system.
 So,
 you
 need
 to
 know


many
 products
 in
 order
 to
 make
 a
 a


kitchen.
 And
 I
 found
 that
 absolutely


fascinating.
 And
 in
 your
 mind,
 what's


the
 key
 to
 a
 good
 kitchen?
 Well,
 a
 good


kitchen
 from
 a
 home
 furnishing


perspective
 is
 actually
 quality.
 So
 by


integrating
 quality
 in
 every
 part
 of


your
 design
 uh
 and
 still
 being
 able
 to


scale
 that
 proves
 that
 you
 actually
 it's


proving
 the
 IKEA
 democratic
 design


formula
 that
 you
 can
 make
 an
 affordable


kitchen
 at
 the
 best
 quality
 but
 then
 I


think
 kitchen
 for
 people
 is
 about
 the


heart
 of
 the
 home.
 It's
 about
 providing


solutions
 where
 people
 you
 know
 relax
 do


their
 homework,
 work
 from
 home
 uh
 enjoy


friends,
 family
 celebrations.
 So
 the


kitchen
 I
 as
 I
 see
 it
 is
 really
 the


heart
 of
 the
 home
 for
 people.
 Do
 you


cook?
 I
 do.
 What?
 I
 thought
 you
 would


ask
 are
 you
 a
 good
 uh
 cook
 but
 I'm
 not.


Well
 I
 in
 in
 our
 family
 I
 am
 the
 chef


chief
 uh
 dishwasher.
 So
 but
 I
 I
 have
 a


couple
 of
 my
 pasta
 bologna


uh
 is
 uh
 is
 good.
 What
 is
 your
 vision


and
 and
 your
 dreams
 for
 IKEA
 for
 the


next
 10
 years?
 So
 for
 IKEA
 for
 the
 next


10
 years
 I
 think
 um
 the
 dream
 is
 to


continue
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 grow
 and
 meet


um
 and
 reach
 more
 people
 both
 offering


jobs
 and
 uh
 meeting
 more
 customers


around
 the
 world
 and
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


dream
 in
 all
 of
 that
 is
 to
 be
 a
 proof


point
 that
 it
 is
 actually
 possible
 to
 be


a
 good
 business
 by
 doing
 good
 business.


So
 the
 integration
 of
 um
 uh
 people,


respectful
 people
 principles
 when
 it


comes
 to
 diversity,
 inclusion,
 uh


respect
 for
 people,
 but
 also
 uh
 setting


up
 IKEA
 as
 a
 truly
 climate
 smart
 value


chain
 and
 driving
 financial
 excellence


through
 that
 is
 the
 big
 vision.
 Last


question.
 What
 is
 your
 advice
 for
 young


people
 because
 we
 got
 tens
 and
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 them
 listening
 into
 this?


Well,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 for
 young
 people


today
 um
 and
 I
 do
 have
 the
 pleasure
 to


meet
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 young
 people
 and
 young


leaders.
 Um
 I
 set
 up
 actually
 um
 a
 group


of
 young
 activists
 that
 is
 advising
 me


and
 my
 management
 group
 um
 and
 they
 do


have
 full
 access
 to
 the
 company
 by
 the


way
 and
 we
 have
 a
 very
 nice
 agreement


that
 they
 actually
 read
 write
 a
 page
 in


in
 our
 annual
 report
 every
 year
 that
 I


don't
 proofread
 before
 they
 uh
 write
 it.


Um
 I
 think


um
 the
 generation
 today
 has
 more


information
 and
 is
 also
 lured
 by


misinformation
 more
 than
 probably
 any


generation
 before.
 So
 I
 think
 the


important
 thing
 is
 to
 have
 hope
 and
 to


uh
 be
 outspoken
 of
 your
 principles
 what


you
 represent
 and
 what
 you
 stand
 for.


And
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 think
 when
 you


think
 about
 the
 future
 look
 for


something
 continue
 to
 look
 for
 the


things
 that
 you're
 good
 at
 and
 the


things
 that
 you
 love
 to
 do.
 And
 if
 you


can
 find
 the
 combination
 of
 those
 two


things,
 uh
 you
 probably
 will
 find


happiness.
 And
 if
 you
 don't,
 there
 is


always
 another
 opportunity
 to
 try


something
 new
 around
 the
 corner.
 Well,


you
 uh
 for
 sure
 have
 created
 a
 lot
 of


happiness
 in
 the
 millions
 of
 homes
 which


you
 have
 furnished.
 And
 uh
 so
 big
 thanks


for
 doing
 all
 that
 for
 the
 world
 and
 for


making
 uh
 all
 our
 homes
 a
 better
 place.


Great
 talking
 to
 you
 for
 this


opportunity.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.
