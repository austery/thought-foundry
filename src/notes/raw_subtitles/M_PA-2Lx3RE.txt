[Music]


hi
 everyone
 I'm
 so
 happy
 to
 be
 here


virtually
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 you


today
 about
 quitting
 in
 particularly
 how


do
 we
 improve
 our
 exit
 decisions
 and
 why


do
 we
 really
 want
 to
 do
 that
 so
 the


problem
 that
 we
 have
 as
 decision
 makers


is
 that
 uncertainty
 makes
 it
 very
 hard


uh
 to
 start
 things
 uh
 and
 that's
 because


there's
 two
 forms
 of
 uncertainty
 that


are
 exerting
 themselves
 on
 any
 decision


that
 we
 make
 the
 first
 is
 just
 plain


luck
 uh
 which
 means
 that
 we
 can
 make
 a


great
 decision
 we
 can
 make
 a
 decision


that's
 going
 to
 work
 out
 90%
 of
 the
 time


but
 10%
 of
 the
 time
 it's
 not
 going
 to


work
 out
 uh
 and
 when
 we
 observe
 that
 10%


is
 wholly
 determined
 by
 luck
 and
 that


makes
 it
 very
 hard
 for
 us
 to
 start


things
 because
 we're
 we're
 trying
 to
 get


more
 control
 than
 we
 actually
 have
 over


what
 the
 outcome
 might
 be
 uh
 which
 is


probabilistic
 in
 nature
 the
 other
 form


of
 uncertainty
 that
 makes
 the
 decision


to
 start
 things
 hard
 is
 that
 we
 know


very
 little
 in
 comparison
 to
 all
 there


is
 to
 be
 known
 and
 so
 this
 can
 make
 it


uh
 so
 that
 we
 really
 slow
 our
 decisions


down
 in
 a
 way
 that
 isn't
 actually


productive
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 a
 level
 of


certainty
 that
 is
 actually


unattainable
 so
 those
 two
 forms
 of


uncertainty
 are
 making
 starting
 things


hard
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is
 that
 for


most
 things
 that
 we
 decide
 to
 do
 we
 have


the
 option
 to
 quit
 later
 uh
 that
 quit


might
 have
 varying
 varying
 costs


associated
 with
 it
 but
 almost
 anything


that
 we
 decide
 to
 start
 we
 can
 actually


quit
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that
 the


uncertainty
 that
 that
 makes
 it
 really


hard
 for
 us
 to
 start
 things
 this
 option


to
 quit
 later
 makes
 that
 start
 easier


because
 we
 can
 anticipate
 the
 ability
 to


exit
 when
 we
 observe
 that
 the
 world


isn't
 going
 in
 our
 direction
 or
 when
 we


observe
 that
 we're
 getting
 signals
 that


we're
 learning
 new
 things
 that
 tell
 us


that
 our
 choice
 wasn't
 actually
 that


good
 so
 you
 can
 think
 about
 it
 like


we've
 all
 had
 that
 feeling
 of
 I
 wish
 I


knew
 then
 what
 I
 know
 now
 uh
 the
 option


to
 quit
 actually
 makes
 it
 so
 that
 we
 can


act
 on
 that
 feeling
 when
 we
 learn
 new


information
 but
 here's
 the
 really
 big


problem
 is
 that
 even
 though
 we
 have
 this


incredibly
 valuable
 option
 and
 I
 would


actually
 argue
 that
 it's
 the
 single
 most


valuable
 option
 that
 we
 have
 in


decision-making
 is
 this
 option
 to
 walk


away
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 we
 actually
 are


quite
 bad
 at
 quitting
 um
 we
 tend
 to
 walk


away
 from
 things
 uh
 much
 too
 late


compared
 to
 when
 if
 you
 were
 just


judging
 expected
 value
 would
 be
 the


correct
 time
 to
 actually
 walk
 away
 so


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 this
 problem


that
 we
 have
 with
 quitting
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 why
 it
 is
 that
 we
 uh


have
 such
 a
 problem
 withit
 quitting
 and


then
 I'm
 going
 to
 hopefully
 give
 you


some
 solutions
 that
 are
 going
 to
 make


this
 all
 a
 little
 bit
 easier
 for
 you


okay
 so
 here's
 the
 important
 thing


remember
 I
 said
 after
 we
 start
 things
 we


get
 new


information
 and
 we
 have
 this
 very
 strong


intuition
 that
 when
 we
 get
 information


from
 the
 world
 that
 things
 aren't
 going


that
 well
 we'll
 actually
 pay
 attention


and
 walk
 away
 so
 when
 we
 get
 those


adverse
 signals
 we're
 going
 to
 stop
 what


we're
 doing
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 all
 think


but
 that
 intuition
 is
 actually
 wrong


instead
 in
 the
 face
 of
 those
 negative


signals
 we
 escalate
 our
 commitment
 and


actually
 in
 reference
 to
 the
 previous


speaker
 I
 use
 mountain
 climbing
 as
 an


example
 for
 this
 we've
 all
 heard
 of


summit
 fever
 we
 have
 the
 intuition
 that


if
 it
 gets
 dark
 and
 we're
 still
 climbing


or
 if
 a
 blizzard
 is
 coming
 in
 uh
 that


we're
 all
 going
 to
 stop
 climbing
 uh
 and


it
 turns
 out
 that
 we
 don't
 and
 you
 can


just
 look
 to
 for
 example
 uh
 1996
 on


Mount
 Everest
 to
 know
 that
 people
 will


continue
 past
 the
 point
 when
 they


already
 have
 um
 adverse
 signals
 1996


being
 that
 tragic
 year


uh
 when
 Rob
 Hall
 and
 Doug
 Hansen
 died
 so


this
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 a
 well
 uh
 known


effect
 it's
 called
 escalation
 of


commitment
 that
 we
 get
 these
 signals
 and


instead
 of
 actually
 reducing
 our


commitment
 to
 the
 cause
 having
 gotten


those
 adverse
 signals
 we
 actually


escalate
 our
 commitment
 to
 the


cause
 and
 of
 course
 continuing
 to
 do


something
 that
 is
 no
 longer
 worthwhile


doesn't
 just
 have
 costs
 associated
 with


doing
 something
 that's
 negative


expectancy
 itself
 but
 there
 there
 are


also
 opportunity
 costs
 associated
 with


it
 so
 we
 have
 this
 added
 cost
 of
 failure


to
 cut
 our
 losses
 that
 we
 can't
 take


that
 Capital
 our
 time
 Attention
 our


money
 our
 effort
 and
 put
 it
 into


something
 that
 would
 actually
 be


worthwhile
 so
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 we


can
 think
 about
 the
 uh
 grit
 and
 quit
 is


not
 as
 oppositional
 but
 as
 kind
 of
 the


same
 decision
 uh
 we
 should
 stick
 to


things
 that
 are
 worthwhile
 and
 we
 should


quit
 things
 that
 aren't
 and
 the
 failure


to
 quit
 things
 that
 are
 no
 longer


worthwhile
 also
 has
 opportunity
 costs


associated
 with
 it
 so
 this
 becomes
 even


more
 important
 to
 get
 this
 quit
 grit


quit
 decision


down
 now
 this
 is
 really
 important


experts
 are
 in
 no
 way
 immune
 to


escalation
 of
 commitment
 they're
 no
 way


in
 no
 way
 immune
 to
 this
 failure
 to
 quit


things
 on
 time
 there
 is
 lots
 and
 lots
 of


data
 and
 I've
 got
 three
 studies
 shown


here
 G
 Garvey
 and
 Murphy
 uh
 Woodcock
 so


on
 so
 forth
 that
 show
 that
 while
 expert


investors
 are
 alpha
 generators
 when


putting
 risk
 on
 they
 give
 Alpha
 back
 on


their
 exit
 decisions
 uh
 and
 in
 fact
 this


2023
 paper
 showed
 that
 uh
 endowments


when
 they
 put
 positions
 on
 are


generating
 between
 120
 and
 180
 bips
 on


those
 uh
 an
 alpha
 on
 those
 decisions
 but


their
 exit
 decisions
 they're
 actually


giving
 about
 70
 to
 80
 bips
 back
 uh
 uh


Woodcock
 and
 then
 also
 Garvey
 and
 Murphy


talk
 about
 the
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 intr
 day


Traders
 are
 also
 uh
 finding
 this
 and


Alex
 emus
 has
 shown
 this
 as
 well
 uh
 very


very
 good
 on
 the
 entry
 uh
 giving
 a
 lot


of
 that
 Alpha
 back
 on
 the
 exit
 and


that's
 why
 I
 think
 this
 option
 to
 quit


is
 so
 incredibly
 valuable
 because
 this


is
 the
 place
 where
 we
 can
 actually
 pick


up
 we
 can
 generate
 a
 lot
 of
 alpha
 uh


compared
 to
 our
 to
 compared
 to
 our


competitors
 so
 why
 is
 it
 that
 it's
 so


hard
 for
 us
 to
 quit
 things
 well
 it
 turns


out
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cognitive


biases
 that
 kind
 of
 pile
 up
 on
 top
 of
 us


that
 make
 us
 slow
 to
 quit
 I'm
 going
 to


walk
 through
 some
 of
 them
 pretty
 quickly


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 cover
 every
 single
 one


of
 them
 uh
 but
 we
 the
 sunk
 cost
 effect


endowment
 status
 quo
 bias
 Omission


commission
 bias
 optimism
 bias
 loss


aversion
 and
 sure
 loss
 aversion
 so
 I'm


going
 to
 walk
 through
 these
 somewhat


quickly
 uh
 the
 sunk
 cost
 effect
 uh
 is


when
 we
 take
 into
 account
 what
 we've


already
 spent
 on
 something
 and
 deciding


whether
 to
 continue
 on
 and
 spend
 more
 in


other
 words
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 we
 have


that
 feeling
 of
 we
 want
 to
 get
 our
 money


back
 or
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 wasted
 uh


what
 we
 already
 put
 into
 something
 the


problem
 of
 course
 is
 that
 waste
 is
 not
 a


retrospective
 problem
 it's
 a
 prospective


problem
 what
 we'd
 ideally
 like
 to
 do
 uh


is
 if
 it
 is
 something
 that
 we
 would


start
 today
 then
 we
 should
 be
 willing
 to


continue
 it
 if
 it
 is
 not
 something
 that


we
 would
 start
 today
 then
 we
 should
 not


continue
 it
 but
 what
 happens
 with
 sun


cost
 is
 that
 instead
 of
 this
 Forward


Thinking
 where
 we're
 saying
 is
 this


something
 that
 we
 would
 actually
 do


start
 today
 would
 we
 put
 this
 position


on
 today
 for
 example
 we
 take
 into


account
 what
 we've
 already
 put
 into
 it


and
 deciding
 whether
 to
 continue
 on
 and


and
 spend
 more
 now
 the
 problem
 is
 it


doesn't
 really
 matter
 uh
 what
 you've


lost
 coming
 up
 to
 that
 moment
 of
 the


decision
 what
 matters
 is
 whether
 the


next
 dollar
 or
 the
 next
 unit
 of
 effort


that
 we
 put
 into
 something
 is
 positive


expectancy
 so
 the
 sunk
 cost
 effect


causes
 us
 to
 continue
 things
 that
 are
 no


longer
 worthwhile
 we
 also
 have
 the


endowment
 effect
 which
 is
 just
 we
 value


things
 that
 we
 own
 more
 than
 identical


things
 uh
 that
 we
 don't
 own
 so
 the


things
 that
 we
 already
 have
 in
 our


portfolio
 the
 positions
 that
 we
 already


have
 on
 this
 is
 even
 true
 of
 our
 own


ideas
 uh
 the
 thesis
 that
 we're
 trading


uh
 the
 ideas
 that
 we
 have
 we
 value
 more


than
 things
 that
 don't
 we
 don't
 own
 so


obviously
 when
 we're
 making
 that


decision
 about
 whether
 it's
 worthwhile


to
 continue
 on
 we're
 going
 to
 distort


our
 view
 of
 what
 the
 expected
 value
 is


uh
 just
 because
 we
 think
 that
 the
 things


that
 we
 own
 are
 more
 valuable
 that
 they


have
 more
 value
 to
 them
 um
 then
 we
 have


sure
 loss
 aversion
 this
 comes
 from
 the


late
 Danny
 Conan
 and
 and
 Amos
 tersi
 uh


which
 is
 essentially
 this
 problem
 that


we're
 biased
 against
 converting
 paper


losses
 into
 realized
 losses
 and
 we


actually
 pay
 to
 avoid
 having
 to
 do
 so
 uh


so
 this
 is
 from
 their
 original
 1979


paper
 on
 prospect
 theory
 uh
 which
 shows


that
 when
 people
 are
 in
 the
 losses
 on
 a


gamble
 uh
 say
 I've
 lost
 $100
 um
 and
 I'm


offered
 a
 Fair
 coin
 flip
 uh
 where
 I
 can


either
 get
 e
 in
 or
 I'll
 lose


$220
 that
 they'll
 prefer
 to
 take
 the


flip
 there
 in
 other
 words
 they're
 paying


$10
 for
 the
 opportunity
 to
 try
 to
 get


even
 and
 that's
 because
 of
 this
 aversion


to
 turning
 a
 paper
 loss
 into
 a
 sure
 loss


and
 obviously
 that's
 a
 huge
 problem
 when


we're
 in
 the
 losses
 on
 a
 position
 that


we're
 holding
 and
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 think


of
 all
 of
 those
 under
 this
 umbrella
 of


we
 just
 don't
 like
 to
 close
 accounts
 in


the
 losses
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 paper


accounts
 this
 has
 to
 do
 with
 our
 mental


accounts
 so
 we
 can
 have
 a
 paper
 account


that's
 in
 the
 gains
 and
 yet
 our
 mental


account
 is
 in
 the
 losses
 if
 we
 buy
 a


stock
 at
 50
 it
 goes
 up
 to
 75
 and
 then
 it


goes
 down
 to
 60
 mentally
 we're
 in
 the


losses
 even
 though
 on
 our
 paper
 Ledger


we're
 in
 the
 gains
 and
 so
 this
 problem


with
 not
 wanting
 to
 close
 accounts
 in


the
 losses
 makes
 us
 very
 slow
 to
 quit
 we


also
 have
 status
 quo
 bias
 a
 preference


for
 sticking
 with
 the
 status
 quo


Omission
 commission
 bias
 we're
 much
 more


tolerant
 of
 losses
 that
 come
 from


sticking
 with
 the
 status
 quo
 in
 other


words
 making
 a
 decision
 not
 to
 switch
 uh


a
 as
 opposed
 to
 making
 a
 decision
 to


switch
 so
 if
 we're
 holding
 a
 position


we're
 going
 to
 be
 more
 tolerant
 of
 the


losses
 that
 might
 generate
 from
 that
 uh


then
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 tolerant
 of


generating
 from
 losses
 uh
 that
 come
 from


us
 switching
 from
 that
 position
 to


something
 new
 which
 also
 makes
 us
 very


slow
 to
 quit
 and
 then
 the
 last
 thing
 is


just
 cognitive
 ID
 dissidence
 identity


and
 validity
 both
 both
 uh
 the
 way
 we


view
 ourselves
 and
 the
 way
 that
 other


people
 uh
 view
 us
 uh
 we
 want
 to
 be
 seen


as
 consistent
 individuals
 over
 time
 uh


part
 of
 the
 decisions
 that
 we
 make


create
 part
 of
 our
 identity
 and
 that's


particularly
 true
 if
 those
 decisions
 are


making
 us
 stand
 out
 from
 the
 crowd
 so


bers
 and
 and
 Milkman
 showed
 that
 when


analysts
 take
 positions
 that
 are


non-consensus
 uh
 on
 earnings
 forecasts


uh
 when
 they're
 non-consensus
 and
 the


World
 Turns
 against
 them
 and
 gives
 them


information
 that
 their
 forecast
 actually


wasn't
 correct
 they'll
 actually
 double


down
 on
 the
 forecast
 but
 when
 they
 make


uh
 when
 they
 make
 uh
 forecasts
 that
 are


in
 consensus
 they're
 perfectly
 willing


to
 change
 according
 to
 what
 the
 world


tells
 them
 and
 that's
 because
 the


non-consensus
 uh
 forecasts
 are
 actually


much
 more
 part
 of
 somebody's
 identity


and
 obviously
 as
 Traders
 um
 or
 as


investors
 we're
 investing
 against
 the


market
 uh
 so
 we're
 often
 trying
 to
 stand


out
 from
 the
 crowd
 do
 something
 where
 we


think
 that
 the
 market
 is
 not
 efficient


and
 that
 makes
 it
 actually
 much
 harder


for
 us
 to
 walk
 away
 because
 it's
 an


attack
 on
 our
 identity
 if
 we
 actually


have
 to
 jump


ship
 okay
 so
 I
 told
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 we
 don't
 stop
 now
 I
 want
 to


give
 you
 quickly
 a
 few
 reasons
 how
 we


can
 help
 you
 to
 get
 better
 at
 these


stopping
 decisions
 the
 first
 is
 to
 set


very
 specific
 kill
 criteria
 which
 are


just
 criteria
 for
 killing
 a
 project


cutting
 your
 losses
 or
 changing
 a
 plan


uh
 so
 the
 first
 step
 is
 to
 identify
 the


way
 that
 things
 might
 go
 wrong
 or
 right


uh
 and
 and
 then
 identify
 the
 early


warning
 signals
 to
 develop
 a
 list
 of


kill
 criteria
 in
 other
 words
 what
 are


those
 signals
 that
 I
 think
 I
 might


ignore
 in
 the
 future
 that
 would
 tell
 me


that
 it's
 time
 to
 walk
 away
 and
 then


pre-commit
 to
 your
 reaction
 to
 those


criteria
 so
 I've
 worked
 with
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 and
 they
 have
 that
 intuition


while
 I
 have
 a
 thesis
 uh
 and
 let's
 say


the
 thesis
 has
 to
 do
 with
 uh
 the


directional
 movement
 of
 interest
 rates


so
 they
 their
 thesis
 is
 that
 interest


rates
 are
 going
 to
 go
 above
 above
 a


certain
 uh
 uh
 Point
 um
 or
 stay
 within
 a


particular
 band


or
 go
 down
 whatever
 that
 thesis
 is
 they


have
 the
 intuitions
 that
 that
 when


interest
 rates
 move
 against
 them
 that


they
 will
 get
 off
 the
 position
 that
 they


will
 take
 risk
 off
 uh
 but
 we
 know
 that


they
 don't
 they
 tend
 to
 get
 thesis
 creep


or
 they
 escalate
 our
 commitment
 or
 they


say
 now
 it's
 really
 cheap
 I
 know
 my


forecast
 is
 still
 correct
 uh
 and
 so
 um


what
 I'm
 doing
 here
 is
 saying
 okay
 if


you
 have
 a
 thesis
 that
 thesis
 is


implying
 certain
 things
 about
 what
 the


world
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 the


future
 right
 down
 what
 that
 thesis
 is


actually
 implying
 and
 then
 develop
 kill


criteria
 in
 other
 words
 if
 interest


rates
 move
 out
 of
 a
 certain
 band
 then
 I


will
 do
 X
 Y
 or
 Z
 so
 if
 they
 go
 above
 a


certain
 band
 maybe
 I'll
 put
 more
 risk
 on


but
 if
 they
 go
 below
 a
 certain
 band
 that


means
 that
 the
 world
 has
 moved
 against


my
 thesis
 and
 I
 need
 to
 actually
 take


the
 risk
 off
 now
 that
 might
 seem
 like
 a


distinction
 without
 a
 difference
 if
 I


have
 a
 thesis
 it's
 predicting
 certain


things
 about
 the
 future
 uh
 why
 is
 it


different
 if
 I
 just
 write
 those
 things


down
 and
 pre-commit
 to
 them
 and
 it
 turns


out
 just
 cognitively
 that
 makes
 a
 huge


difference
 uh
 to
 think
 ahead
 actually


identify
 what
 those
 kill
 criteria
 are


and
 then
 and
 then
 pre-commit
 to
 to
 the


actions
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 take
 when


you
 see
 those
 signals
 develop
 the
 next


thing
 is
 to
 create
 better
 feedback
 loops


one
 of
 the
 problems
 that
 we
 have
 on
 the


quits
 when
 we
 take
 risk
 off
 is
 that
 we


really
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 feedback
 loop


on
 how
 those
 decisions
 compare
 to
 a


benchmark
 so
 we
 consistently
 track


positions
 we
 have


on
 and
 obviously
 because
 they're
 in
 our


portfolio
 we
 also
 even
 uh
 track


positions
 that
 we're
 considering
 putting


on
 because
 we'll
 create
 Shadow
 books
 but


what
 we
 don't
 do
 is
 consistently
 track


positions
 that
 we
 take
 off
 so
 what
 we


want
 to
 do
 is
 create
 a
 benchmark
 W


against
 which
 we
 can
 actually
 measure


the
 quality
 of
 our
 quitting
 decisions
 so


we
 can
 do
 that
 in
 a
 couple
 ways
 one


thing
 is
 for
 example
 if
 we're
 freeing
 up


Capital
 uh
 we
 can
 create
 a
 benchmark


which
 is
 what
 if
 I
 randomly
 freed
 this


Capital
 up
 from
 anywhere
 in
 my
 portfolio


and
 actually
 judge
 my
 quit
 decision


against
 that
 over
 the
 course
 of
 a
 period


of
 time
 uh
 you
 can
 also
 actually
 start


to
 uh
 track
 your
 um
 uh
 things
 that
 you


hold
 and
 look
 at
 uh
 what
 would
 have


happened
 if
 I
 had
 actually
 sold
 those


things
 earlier
 at
 the
 time
 that
 I


considered
 it
 but
 be
 creative
 and
 try
 to


actually
 create
 benchmarks
 against
 which


you
 can
 actually
 start
 to
 judge
 your


quitting
 decisions
 so
 that
 you
 can
 start


to
 get
 feedback
 on
 whether
 you're


generating
 Alpha
 on
 those
 exit
 decisions


or
 giving
 Alpha
 a
 back
 on
 those
 exit


decisions
 and
 the
 last
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 a


big
 favorite
 of
 mine
 go
 get
 yourself
 a


quitting
 coach
 because
 an
 honest
 broker


someone
 who's
 standing
 on
 the
 outside


looking
 in
 on
 your
 situation
 is
 going
 to


see
 your
 situation
 more
 clearly
 than
 you


can
 and
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 they're
 not


carrying
 all
 of
 the
 sunk
 cost
 they're


not
 carrying
 the
 endowment
 they
 don't


they
 don't
 have
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 biases


piled
 up
 on
 them
 that
 are
 making
 them


not
 be
 able
 to
 see
 that
 situation
 so


clearly
 so
 someone
 from
 the
 outside


looking
 in
 is
 going
 to
 see
 your


situation
 more
 clearly
 than
 you
 can
 and


so
 if
 you
 work
 with
 them
 to
 pre-commit


to
 an
 exit
 plan
 with
 a
 quitting
 coach
 it


actually
 makes
 it
 more
 likely
 that


you'll
 follow
 through
 so
 they
 can
 both


see
 the
 decision
 more
 clearly
 than
 you


can
 and
 they
 create
 accountability
 that


are
 going
 to
 make
 you
 actually
 follow


through
 on
 those
 quitting
 plans
 so


actually
 when
 I've
 worked
 with
 for


example
 solo
 PMS
 I've
 paired
 them


together
 so
 that
 they
 can
 coach
 each


other
 on
 these
 exit
 decisions
 so
 I
 hope


that
 this
 uh
 bit
 about
 exiting
 uh
 you're


going
 to
 find
 helpful
 uh
 I
 really


believe
 that
 this
 could
 be
 the
 single


biggest
 uh
 Alpha
 generator
 for
 you
 right


now
 in
 your
 own
 investing
 life
 uh


because
 we
 are
 so
 bad
 at
 it
 and
 nobody's


really
 paying
 attention
 to
 how
 good


these
 exit
 decisions
 are
 so
 if
 you
 can


get
 better
 at
 these
 exit
 decisions
 I


think
 this
 is
 going
 this
 uh
 will
 vastly


improve
 your
 returns
 thank
 you
 so
 much
