[Music]


So
 today
 we
 are
 in
 very
 good
 company


with
 Ken
 Rolstrom
 the
 CEO
 and
 president


of
 Daimler
 Truck
 which
 is
 the
 largest


commercial
 vehicle
 producer
 in
 the


world.
 Ken
 has
 recently
 been
 named


Sweden's
 most
 important
 businesswoman


and
 Dino
 Truck
 and
 at
 Daimler
 Truck
 she


is
 driving
 the
 conversion
 of
 legacy


diesel
 champion
 into
 a
 future
 ready


mobility
 powerhouse.
 Now
 uh
 Colleen
 you


combine
 uh
 engineering
 background


background
 with
 a
 background
 in
 elite


sport.
 So
 a
 warm
 welcome.


>> Thank
 you.
 So
 now
 you
 and
 I,
 we
 are


going
 into
 a
 truck.
 Okay.
 You
 are


sitting
 in
 the
 in
 the
 driving
 seat.
 I'm


sitting
 next
 to
 you.
 And
 now
 you're


going
 to
 tell
 me
 what
 what
 makes
 a
 good


truck.
 What
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 look


for?


>> Uh
 well,
 the
 cab
 is
 like
 the
 driver's


living
 room.
 Yeah.


>> So
 that's
 what
 I
 look
 for
 basically.
 Is


it
 practical?
 Is
 there
 storage
 space?


How's
 the
 bed?
 Of
 course.
 Also,
 how
 do


you
 interact
 with
 with
 the
 truck?
 Um,


yeah,
 but
 I
 honestly
 I
 was
 thinking
 it


didn't
 really
 change
 so
 much
 with
 all


the
 new
 trends
 with
 electrification,


digitalization.
 It's
 it's
 still
 a
 living


room
 and
 a
 working
 office.


>> When
 people
 buy
 a
 truck,
 uh,
 what
 do


they
 look
 what
 what
 what
 are
 the


decisive
 elements?
 What
 is
 it
 that
 make


you
 win
 the
 the
 purchase?


>> Um,
 well,
 I
 think
 it
 depends
 who
 which


perspective
 you
 take.
 So
 now
 we
 started


with
 like
 the
 driver
 perspective
 which


is
 the
 cab
 and
 the
 living
 space
 but
 of


course
 also
 that
 the
 truck
 does
 the
 job


and
 I
 think
 they're
 still


>> kind
 of
 old
 school
 so
 they
 want
 to
 go


faster
 up
 the
 hill
 than
 their
 colleague


with
 the
 other
 brand.
 So
 that's
 still


important.
 Uh
 but
 then
 of
 course
 usually


the
 people
 deciding
 which
 brand
 to
 buy


are
 the
 owners
 and
 they
 look
 for
 the


whatever
 truck
 will
 give
 them
 the
 best


cost
 of
 operation
 because
 they're


running
 a
 business.
 So


>> is
 there
 a
 big
 difference
 between
 the


two
 views?
 So
 the
 driver
 and
 the
 owner


>> sometimes.


>> Yeah.
 But
 uh
 generally
 I
 think
 if
 you


have
 good
 cost
 of
 operation


means
 you
 invest
 into
 R&D,
 you
 have
 a


good
 engine,
 good
 powertrain,
 generally


the
 same
 brands
 also
 do
 more
 for
 the


drivers.
 So


>> you
 um
 split
 it
 into
 segments
 of
 light,


medium
 and
 and
 heavy.
 And
 where
 so
 where


are
 you
 positioned?


>> So
 we
 mainly
 focus
 on
 heavy
 duty
 but
 we


we
 are
 a
 full
 liner
 with
 some
 of
 our


brands.
 Um
 so
 for
 instance
 with
 with
 our


Japanese
 brand
 Fuzo
 we
 are
 very
 strong


on
 light
 duty.
 Um
 with
 Western
 Star
 in


Freightlininer
 um
 we
 have
 both
 heavy


duty
 but
 also
 some
 medium
 duty.
 So
 but
 I


would
 say
 globally
 probably
 50
 60%
 at


least
 heavy
 duty.


>> How
 do
 you
 make
 money?
 Is
 it
 by
 selling


the
 trucks
 or
 is
 it
 by
 servicing
 them
 or


repair
 or
 what
 is
 it?
 hopefully
 both.


>> But
 uh
 for
 sure
 like
 one
 of
 the
 upsides


that
 we
 have
 as
 Daimler
 truck
 compared


to
 some
 of
 our
 competitors
 is
 we
 can
 get


even
 better
 with
 services.
 Um
 where


basically
 in
 the
 old
 structure
 that
 we


had
 in
 Daimler


>> which
 was
 a
 big
 conglomerate
 you
 know


with
 Mercedes-Benz
 cars
 until
 three


years
 ago
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 service
 stuff
 was


done
 through
 the
 mothership.
 Um,
 so


that's
 something
 I
 think
 we're
 catching


up
 and
 we're
 developing
 right
 now
 and


growing.


>> How
 cyclical
 is
 the
 market
 and
 I
 mean


what
 are
 what
 are
 the
 drivers?
 What
 what


do
 you
 look
 at
 in
 which
 times
 are
 you


selling
 more
 trucks?


>> Uh,
 generally
 it
 runs
 pretty
 much
 in


parallel
 with
 the
 overall
 economy.
 So


you
 know
 when
 people
 are
 investing
 into


building
 projects,
 construction,
 they


need
 trucks.
 Uh,
 if
 people
 are
 ordering


more
 goods
 to
 parcels
 or
 whatever,
 you


need
 trucks
 to
 bring
 them
 to
 the
 people.


So
 I
 would
 say
 overall
 it
 just
 generally


really
 follows
 the
 or
 even
 I
 would
 say


sometimes
 we
 know
 early
 how
 the
 general


economy
 is
 going
 to
 develop
 because
 we


see
 the
 how
 much
 the
 trucks
 are
 running


and
 we
 see
 the
 buying
 and
 purchase


behavior
 of
 our
 customers.


>> So
 what
 are
 you
 seeing
 just
 now?


>> Uh
 yeah
 it's
 not
 looking
 so
 great


unfortunately.
 So
 it's
 it's
 pretty
 slow


market.
 Um
 we
 don't
 I
 mean


>> why
 why
 is
 it
 slow?
 Um
 I
 think
 in
 the
 US


at
 the
 moment
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty
 about


where
 the
 economy
 is
 going
 to
 go
 and
 I


think
 uncertainty
 is
 never
 good
 for
 our


customers
 then
 they
 rather
 just
 run
 the


fleet
 and
 they
 wait


>> because
 it's
 a
 big
 investment
 right?


>> Yeah
 it's
 it's
 the
 most
 important


investment
 they
 do
 in
 their
 business.


Mhm.


>> Um
 and
 in
 Europe
 like
 we
 hear
 a
 lot
 of


positive
 things
 like
 you
 know
 for


instance
 in
 Germany
 we
 have
 the


infrastructure
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 defense


initiatives
 but
 so
 far
 we
 don't
 really


see
 it
 in
 in
 the
 market.


>> Why
 do
 you
 have
 so
 many
 brands?
 You
 got


you
 know
 Freightlininer
 Mercedes
 Fuso


Western
 Star.
 Easier
 just
 to
 have
 one.


>> Yeah
 we
 have
 we
 have
 even
 more
 actually.


uh
 but
 it
 it
 comes
 from
 history
 uh
 and


and
 they
 all
 stand
 for
 different
 things


for
 the
 customers
 I
 would
 say.


>> Um
 so
 if
 I
 give
 an
 example
 on
 the
 coach


side
 we
 have
 Cetra
 which
 is
 actually


positioned
 higher
 than
 Mercedes-Benz


um
 and
 that's
 something
 we
 acquired
 um


yeah
 now
 many
 years
 ago.
 So
 that
 has
 a


higher
 brand
 value
 than
 Mercedes
 um
 for


a
 coach
 customer.
 And
 why
 why
 would
 you


take
 that
 away
 or
 Western
 Star
 in
 the


US?
 That's
 a
 super
 strong
 brand
 for
 like


heavy
 duty
 timber
 construction.
 Um


so
 it
 makes
 sense
 to
 to
 keep
 most
 brands


and
 then
 of
 course
 sometimes
 we
 buy


stuff
 where
 we
 might
 consider
 changing


the
 brand
 too.
 Now
 we're
 seeing
 in
 uh
 in


cars
 but
 also
 in
 tracks
 uh
 the
 trend


towards
 uh
 more
 technology,
 more


software
 and
 so
 on.
 How
 how
 is
 it
 to


change
 a
 100
 year old
 company
 into
 a


software
 company?


>> Uh
 it's
 not
 easy.
 I
 mean
 we're
 I
 I
 don't


think
 we
 will
 become
 a
 software
 company


per
 se.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 but
 for
 sure
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 tasks


I
 have
 as
 CEO
 is
 to
 drive
 culture
 change


to
 make
 I
 mean
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 in


diamond
 the
 truck
 about
 simpler,
 faster,


stronger
 which
 is
 what
 we
 especially


simper
 faster
 is
 something
 we
 need
 to
 do


and
 and
 we
 need
 to
 have
 in
 mind
 in


everything
 we
 do
 which
 will
 hopefully


then
 make
 us
 stronger.
 Our
 processes
 are


developed
 for
 product
 development
 and


for
 kind
 of
 slow
 cycles
 you
 know
 like
 a


diesel
 engine
 takes
 like
 five
 six
 years


to
 develop.
 Um
 so
 we
 have
 to
 challenge


everything
 right
 now


>> and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 most
 difficult


but
 also
 interesting
 part
 of
 my
 job


actually
 to
 try
 to
 drive
 that
 change.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that?
 I
 mean
 uh


Schlutgkart
 is
 not
 exactly
 Silicon


Valley
 right?
 So


uh
 you
 know
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 attracting


the
 talent
 and


>> I
 think
 um
 we
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


actually
 thinking
 about
 how
 to
 drive


culture
 change


>> um
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 found
 kind
 of
 a


good
 method
 which
 is
 um
 if
 you
 look
 at


culture
 it's
 actually
 just
 it's
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 practices
 that
 you
 have
 in


a
 company
 and
 in
 order
 to
 change


practices
 you
 need
 to
 look
 at
 like


acknowledge
 or
 or
 or
 kind
 of
 where


what's
 the
 target
 picture?
 Where
 do
 we


want
 to
 go?
 And
 I
 talked
 about
 this


simpler
 faster.
 So
 that's
 like


addressing
 just
 the
 awareness
 of
 the


people
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 putting
 the


posters
 on
 the
 wall
 in
 the
 elevator
 or


like
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 bring
 everyone
 a


t-shirt
 that
 says
 simpler,
 faster,


stronger.
 Uh
 but
 then
 to
 really
 drive


change
 you
 also
 need
 to
 look
 at
 like


which
 processes
 and
 methods
 do
 we
 have?


Um,
 so
 that's
 like
 the
 structured
 things


and
 how
 do
 we
 want
 to
 change
 those?
 And


then
 I
 think
 the
 third
 thing
 you
 need
 to


look
 at
 which
 is
 maybe
 the
 most


important
 but
 also
 the
 hardest
 to
 grasp


that's
 like
 all
 the
 behaviors
 that
 exist


that
 are
 not
 written
 but
 that
 are
 part


of
 how
 we
 do
 things.


>> Um,


>> well
 that's
 the
 definition
 of


copaculture.


to
 grab
 them
 and
 you
 have
 to
 very


I
 think
 persistently
 address
 and
 change


some
 of
 the


>> kind
 of
 key
 key
 topics.
 You
 have
 to
 look


at
 all
 of
 those.


>> How
 long
 time
 do
 you
 think
 it
 takes
 to


change
 corpora
 culture?


>> How
 long
 is
 a
 string?
 It's
 I
 think


really
 hard
 to
 answer
 because
 it's
 it's


also
 not
 about
 you've
 been
 running
 in


one
 direction
 and
 you
 move
 everything


180
 degrees.
 that
 that's
 not
 what
 we


want
 to
 do
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 will
 be


successful.
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 like
 the


startup
 from
 Silicon
 Valley
 because


we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 successful
 if
 we


try
 to
 be
 that
 company.
 But
 I
 think
 to


really
 make
 a
 step
 change
 you
 probably


need
 four
 five
 years
 in
 a
 I
 mean
 in
 a


we're
 also
 global
 company
 100
 5,000


people.


>> So
 obviously
 in
 a
 smaller
 company
 you


can
 do
 it
 faster.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 still
 tough.
 I
 mean,
 you


know,
 our
 company
 is
 700
 people
 and
 it's


still
 um
 it's
 not
 done
 overnight.
 Huh.


But
 what
 what
 part
 of
 that
 cultural


change
 do
 you
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 the
 the


toughest?


>> I
 think
 being
 in
 this
 German
 context,
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 pride
 in
 in
 our
 attention


to
 detail.


>> Um
 so
 I
 think
 over
 time
 that
 has
 also


been
 part
 of
 our
 success
 in
 the
 past.


But
 to
 dare
 to
 let
 go
 a
 little
 bit,
 to


try
 new
 things
 and
 to
 push
 things


through
 a
 little
 bit
 faster
 is
 difficult


for
 people.
 Um
 so
 that's
 something


quite
 challenging
 but
 we
 also
 see
 that


we
 cannot
 work
 at
 the
 speed
 that
 we
 have


done
 if
 we
 want
 to
 be
 competitive
 in
 the


future.
 I
 mean
 you
 are
 in
 a
 it's
 it's
 an


incred
 you
 are at
 an
 incredible
 time
 in


your
 business
 right
 because


you
 know
 uh
 you
 have
 a
 trend
 towards
 uh


you
 know
 uh
 battery


uh
 focus
 on
 climate
 uh
 digitalization


connectivity


uh
 geopolitics


uh


>> software


>> yeah
 absolutely
 you
 know
 the
 whole


software
 development
 so
 how
 do
 you


prioritize


>> yeah
 I
 would
 say
 those
 are
 like
 the


general
 things
 happening
 but
 then
 at
 the


same
 time
 we're
 just
 three
 years
 old,


four
 years
 old
 as
 a
 company
 soon.


>> So
 we
 are
 just
 becoming
 like
 a


standalone
 independent
 company.
 Um
 and


we're
 driving
 culture
 change
 and
 we
 need


to
 improve
 our
 performance.
 Um
 so
 how
 do


you
 prioritize?
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 that


different
 from
 in
 normal
 times.
 You
 have


to
 write
 down
 what
 are
 like
 the
 top
 five


things
 I
 need
 to
 get
 done.
 in
 some


perspective.
 I
 usually
 do
 it
 like
 half


year
 cycles
 and
 just
 make
 sure
 to
 really


get
 the
 most
 important
 things
 done
 and


that
 also
 means
 sometimes
 some
 things


have
 to
 wait
 that
 are
 also
 important.
 Um


>> well
 let's
 let's
 unpick
 it
 a
 bit.
 Let's


start
 with
 the
 software.
 What
 are
 the


kind
 of
 things
 you
 are
 developing
 on
 the


software
 side?
 Um,
 but
 we
 just
 I
 think


we're
 still,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 how
 the


truck
 looks
 today,
 for
 sure
 a
 lot


happened
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 years,


but
 I
 would
 still
 it's
 I
 would
 say
 it's


still
 pretty
 old
 style.
 So,
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 um
 HPUs
 or
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 ECUs


like
 electronic
 control
 units,
 couple
 of


hundred
 in
 the
 truck
 and
 they
 all
 steer


different
 functions.
 Um
 so
 that
 makes
 us


kind
 of
 slow
 because
 we
 also
 code
 design


with
 our
 suppliers
 and
 we
 every
 time
 we


want
 to
 develop
 a
 new
 function
 you
 need


to
 touch
 the
 hardware
 and
 the
 software.


Um
 so
 what
 we
 are
 doing
 now
 we
 just


formed
 a
 new
 company
 um
 together
 with


Volvo
 actually
 um
 to
 to
 do
 the
 basic


layers
 together.
 Um
 and
 what
 we
 want
 to


do
 is
 to
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 high


performing


computers
 um
 and
 then
 independently


develop
 the
 software.
 So
 it's
 very
 much


following
 what
 the
 car
 industry
 has
 been


moving
 towards.
 But
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


different
 for
 trucks
 because
 we
 need


just
 different
 functions.
 So
 when
 when


you
 are
 done
 with
 this
 work
 and
 it's


kind
 of
 totally
 software
 enabled,
 what


what
 is
 different?


>> Um
 what
 you
 can
 do
 is
 you
 can
 do
 a
 lot


more
 things
 software
 only.
 Um
 so
 you


don't
 need
 to
 touch
 the
 hardware
 in
 the


truck
 at
 all
 as
 much
 which
 makes
 you


much
 faster.
 Um
 and
 and
 the
 sensors
 in


the
 truck
 can
 be
 dumber
 because
 you
 have


the
 compute
 really
 centralized
 in
 one


unit.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 will
 be
 a
 time


where
 you
 sell
 uptime
 and


instead
 of
 selling
 the
 truck
 you
 just


sell?


>> I
 mean
 we
 we
 are
 moving
 in
 that


direction.
 We
 do
 it
 to
 some
 extent
 today


because
 we
 do
 full
 service
 lease


contracts.
 Um
 so
 we're
 definitely
 going


in
 that
 direction
 and
 I
 would
 say


already
 in
 some
 city
 bus
 tenders
 we
 have


an
 uptime
 guarantee
 of
 how
 how
 much
 the


the
 bus
 should
 be
 running.
 M


>> um
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 opportunity
 with


electrification
 because
 it
 brings
 so


much
 uncertainty
 for
 our
 customers
 where


all
 they
 want
 to
 do
 is
 take
 down
 risk


and
 if
 we
 can
 manage
 that
 risk
 better


then
 um
 we
 should
 be
 able
 to
 offer
 them


uptime.
 So
 yes,


>> tell
 me
 about
 the
 trend
 towards
 uh


autonomous
 vehicles
 in
 the
 truck


business.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 a


trend,
 but
 it's
 obviously
 something


where
 we
 invest
 a
 lot.
 Um
 we
 believe
 the


best
 place
 to
 do
 it
 is
 in
 the
 US.
 Um


because
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all
 the
 driver


wages
 are
 the
 highest.


>> Um
 and
 also
 they
 drive
 extremely
 long


distances.
 Um
 so
 we
 have
 our
 own
 company


there
 called
 Torque
 uh
 which
 we
 own
 to


93%


[Music]


uh
 where
 we're
 we're
 developing
 this
 u


where
 the
 software
 to
 drive
 autonomous


and
 then
 of
 course
 you
 need
 to
 do
 a
 lot


on
 the
 truck
 side.
 You
 need
 to
 have


every
 system
 needs
 to
 be
 redundant.
 So


in
 case
 there
 is
 a
 failure
 you
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 switch
 over
 to
 you
 know


redundant
 braking
 or
 steering.
 Um,
 so


that
 part
 we
 develop
 within
 Daimler
 and


the
 software
 we
 develop
 in
 Torque,
 but


we
 also
 work
 I
 mean
 we've
 worked
 with


Whimo
 for
 instance
 for
 for
 many
 years


until
 they
 stepped
 out
 of
 trucking.


>> Yeah.
 Is
 so
 is
 it
 very
 difficult
 to
 make


a
 self-driving
 truck
 compared
 to
 a


self-driving
 car?


>> Very
 good
 question.
 I
 I'm
 asking
 all


experts
 that
 I'm
 getting
 kind
 of
 into


this
 myself.
 So
 uh
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 uh


it's
 easier
 because
 it's
 you
 know
 mainly


driving
 on
 highway.
 Yeah.
 So
 you
 don't


have
 all
 these
 edge
 cases.
 But
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 um
 it's
 driving,
 you
 know,


90
 kilometers
 an
 hour
 and
 if
 something


happens,
 the
 the
 accident
 can
 be
 pretty


severe.


>> Um
 so
 in
 the
 end,
 I'm
 still
 looking
 for


the
 answer.


>> When
 do
 you
 think
 when
 you


>> But
 I
 mean,
 we
 see
 robo
 taxes
 already


today
 running
 in
 some
 cities
 and
 we


don't
 yet
 see
 autonomous
 trucks.
 So
 I


guess


>> when
 will
 we
 see
 it?
 When
 will
 we
 see


Oh,
 I
 think
 uh
 27
 28
 in
 commercial


um
 lines.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 already
 some


tests.
 Uh
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 driver
 out


stuff.
 Uh
 but
 we
 still
 have
 the
 safety


drivers
 sitting
 in
 the
 chair.


>> Um
 so,


>> uh


>> it's
 not
 that
 far
 off.


>> No.
 When
 will
 the
 uh
 what
 about
 the
 new


competitors
 coming
 into
 that
 area?
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 I
 think
 we
 see
 the
 opportunity


because
 on
 the
 one
 side
 you
 have
 the


hardware
 and
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 develop


that
 and
 and
 that's
 also
 going
 to
 be
 a


competitive
 advantage
 if
 you
 have
 a
 good


redundant
 chassis
 and
 there
 we
 believe


we
 are
 super
 well
 positioned.
 So
 we


could
 work
 with
 new
 competitors
 like


Aurora
 or
 Kodiak
 or
 or
 or
 other
 players


but
 then
 of
 course
 with
 Torque
 we


compete
 with
 them.
 uh
 but
 we
 believe


that
 because
 we
 have
 that
 close


because
 we're
 working
 closely
 with


Daimler
 and
 torque
 that's
 an
 advantage


for
 us
 um
 which
 should
 help
 us.


>> Another
 thing
 is
 of
 course
 the


decarbonization


uh
 uh
 kind
 of
 dilemma
 you
 just
 how
 are


you
 going
 to
 get
 to
 zero
 emission.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 So
 um
 we


have
 developed
 electric
 trucks.
 So
 we


basically
 can
 offer
 electric
 trucks
 in


almost
 all
 use
 cases.
 Um
 in
 the
 US
 we


see
 environmental
 legislation
 kind
 of


rolled
 back.
 So
 we
 believe
 it
 will
 just


slow
 down
 significantly
 now.
 Um
 and
 it


will
 probably
 take
 to
 beyond
 2030
 before


we
 see
 it
 picking
 up
 again.
 Uh
 while
 in


Europe
 we
 have
 very
 tough
 legislation


that
 pushes


um
 electrification.


I
 think
 the
 challenge
 there
 is
 that
 for


our
 customer
 to
 um
 transition
 from


diesel
 to
 electric
 there
 needs
 to
 be


three
 things
 in
 place
 and
 we
 usually
 say


it's
 like
 an
 equation.
 So
 you
 need
 to


have
 the
 truck
 uh
 and
 that's
 obviously


we
 have
 one
 available
 so
 do
 our


competitors
 um
 you
 need
 to
 have
 uh
 TCO


so
 cost
 of
 operations
 needs
 to
 be


competitive
 um
 and
 there
 it
 starts
 to


get
 there
 I
 would
 say
 in
 some
 use
 cases


especially
 um
 if
 you
 drive
 longer


distances
 because
 the
 truck
 is
 always


going
 to
 be
 more
 expensive
 to
 buy


electric
 than
 a
 diesel
 but
 then
 the


running
 cost
 is
 lower
 and
 we
 also
 see


like
 in
 Germany
 we
 have
 the
 road
 taller


system
 the
 mount
 which
 has
 an
 advantage


for
 electric
 trucks
 which
 is
 around
 30


cents
 per
 kilometer
 so
 it's
 like
 the


cost
 of
 operation
 starts
 to
 be


comparable
 and
 then
 the
 third
 part
 of


the
 equation
 is
 the
 infrastructure
 to
 be


able
 to
 charge
 um
 in
 the
 depo
 or
 along


the
 route
 and
 I
 believe
 that's
 the
 most


difficult
 challenge
 to
 solve
 Um
 and
 then


maybe
 coming
 back
 to
 where
 we
 started
 as


you
 know
 if
 you
 have
 an
 equation
 and
 one


part
 is
 zero
 nothing
 happens.
 So
 where


we
 really
 need
 to
 see
 more
 initiatives


and
 and
 more
 speed
 is
 on
 the


infrastructure
 side.


>> Um


>> so
 how
 do
 you
 cope
 with
 this
 situation


where
 Europe
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 full
 speed


ahead
 and
 the
 US
 is
 kind
 of
 pressing
 on


the
 on
 the
 brake
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 there
 were
 some
 projects


that
 we
 planned
 uh
 to
 have
 as
 global


projects
 like
 battery
 platforms
 and


stuff
 where
 uh
 we
 are
 now
 looking
 like


can
 we
 do
 more
 with
 partners,
 can
 we


derisk
 to
 buy
 for
 a
 longer
 time
 things


that
 we
 were
 planning
 to
 develop


ourselves.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


stepwise
 looking
 at
 because
 there's
 also


in
 Europe
 uncertainty
 how
 quickly
 it's


going
 to
 scale
 and
 like
 in
 everything
 we


do
 we
 try
 to
 think
 of
 the
 low
 volume


scenario
 and
 the
 high
 volume
 scenario.


So,
 as
 an
 example,
 when
 we
 were


integrating
 the
 electric
 trucks
 into
 the


production
 line,
 we
 do
 it
 on
 the
 same


line
 as
 where
 we're
 producing
 the


diesel.
 And
 that
 way,
 we
 can
 really


balance
 depending
 on
 how
 the
 demand


develops.


>> What
 are
 you
 uh
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts


on
 hydrogen?


>> Uh
 well,
 we
 really
 believe
 hydrogen
 is


necessary
 if
 Europe
 is
 serious
 about


decarbonization.


um
 because
 we
 see
 already
 today
 when
 I


think
 this
 year
 to
 date
 around
 3%
 of


trucks
 registered
 were
 electric
 and
 all


the
 struggles
 our
 customers
 already
 have


on
 the
 infrastructure
 side
 to
 get


electrified
 because
 of
 grid
 challenges


because
 of
 not
 enough
 green
 electricity


in
 Europe.
 Um
 so
 if
 you
 look
 in
 a
 longer


perspective
 there
 is
 no
 way
 you're
 going


to
 have
 six
 million
 trucks
 in
 Europe
 all


running
 electric.
 And
 that's
 where


hydrogen
 plays
 a
 role.
 Some
 people
 say


that
 hydrogen
 won't
 like
 it
 doesn't
 make


sense
 because
 it's
 less
 efficient
 than


diesel,
 which
 is
 true
 in
 a
 sense,
 but
 I


believe
 it's
 an
 answer
 to
 the
 wrong


question


because
 Europe
 is
 going
 to
 need
 to


import
 energy


and
 a
 good
 way
 to
 do
 that
 will
 be
 as
 a


hydrogen
 molecule.
 Um,
 and
 then
 you


might
 as
 well
 use
 it
 in
 a
 truck
 and


that's
 a
 pretty
 efficient
 flow.
 And


actually
 also
 building
 hydrogen


infrastructure
 when
 you
 scale
 it


is
 less
 expensive
 than
 to
 try
 to
 scale


electric
 infrastructure
 only.
 So
 there


will
 be
 a
 point
 where
 we
 will
 need


hydrogen.


>> So
 you
 are
 developing
 both.


>> We
 are
 developing
 both.


>> Yeah.
 If
 you
 were
 to
 put
 your
 money
 on


one
 of
 them.
 Well,
 electric
 is
 more
 here


and
 now
 and
 hydrogen
 is
 still
 some
 years


off.
 But
 if
 we're
 serious
 about


decarbonization,


it
 won't
 work
 with
 just
 one.
 We
 need


both.


>> When
 you
 look
 at
 China
 and
 the


electrification
 we
 are
 seeing
 in
 the


trucks
 business,
 I
 mean
 CL
 was
 just
 out


and
 said
 that
 by
 2028
 they
 expect
 50%
 of


the
 the
 new
 trucks
 to
 be
 electric.
 Um,


what
 are
 your
 when
 you
 see
 that
 kind
 of


statement,
 what
 are
 your
 reflections?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 so
 far
 off
 where


we
 need
 to
 be
 in
 Europe
 if
 we're
 going


to
 deliver
 on
 the
 CO2
 targets.
 So,
 my


reflection
 is
 we
 need
 to
 speed
 up.
 We


need
 in
 Europe
 more
 initiatives
 to
 build


the
 infrastructure.
 Um,
 and
 I
 also
 think


we
 have
 a
 unique
 opportunity
 in
 Europe


because
 we
 are
 still
 leader
 in
 this


space.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 big


global
 companies
 in
 the
 trucking
 space,


three
 out
 of
 the
 four
 big
 ones
 are


European
 and
 we're
 leading
 in


technology.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 still


time,
 but
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 start
 moving


faster.
 And
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 the


companies,
 it's
 also
 about


>> legisl
 legislation,
 infrastructure.
 I


think
 we
 spend
 way
 too
 much
 effort
 and


money
 just
 to
 fulfill
 let's
 say


sometimes
 I
 say
 stupid
 regulations
 that


we
 have
 in
 Europe
 instead
 of
 investing


into
 innovation
 and
 and
 really
 moving
 to


stay
 ahead


>> and
 to
 give
 you
 an
 example
 we're
 also


right
 now
 investing
 in
 Euro7
 which
 is


the
 next
 level
 diesel
 uh
 regulation


it
 would
 be
 much
 better
 it's
 a
 small


difference
 between
 Euro
 in
 Euro7
 to


start
 with.
 So
 the
 current
 diesel


standard
 and
 the
 coming
 one.
 So
 if
 we


could
 have
 invested
 those
 couple
 of


hundred
 millions
 into
 electric


infrastructure,
 it
 would
 have
 been
 much


better
 for
 Europe
 and
 for
 the
 companies


and
 for
 our
 customers.


>> How
 fast
 is
 the
 the
 buildout
 of
 um
 kind


of
 battery
 swap
 stations
 compared
 to


what
 it
 need
 to
 be?


>> Uh
 well,
 it's
 not
 so
 easy
 for
 trucks


because
 you
 know
 each
 battery
 weighs


like
 one
 two
 tons.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 we
 actually
 don't
 really


think
 that's
 the
 path
 for
 trucks
 in


>> but
 that
 but
 that's
 what
 they
 think
 in


China,
 right?


>> I
 think
 it's
 it
 started
 like
 that.
 I


think
 it's
 moving
 a
 little
 bit
 away
 from


that.
 I
 think
 they're
 trying
 both.
 Um,


so
 we're
 obviously
 following
 that.
 We
 do


some
 small
 stuff
 also
 with
 with
 battery


uh
 swap
 in
 Japan.
 So
 some
 pilot
 projects


and
 stuff.
 So
 learning
 about
 the


technology.
 Um
 but
 I
 think
 it
 will
 not


be
 feasible
 at
 least
 not
 for
 heavy
 duty


trucks.
 Uh
 but
 let's
 see.


>> How
 do
 you
 see
 your
 development
 in


China?


>> Well,
 we
 are
 in
 a
 joint
 venture
 there


with
 with
 Photon.
 We've
 been
 for
 12


years.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 secret
 that


we
 haven't
 quite
 developed
 as
 we
 would


have
 liked.
 Um
 and
 that's
 something


we're
 currently
 discussing
 with
 our


partner
 like
 how
 can
 we
 turn
 that


around?
 How
 can
 we
 be
 more
 successful?


And
 is
 there
 a
 way
 for
 us
 as
 diamond


truck
 to
 be
 also
 profitable
 in
 China?


>> K
 I'd
 love
 to
 spend
 a
 bit
 more
 time
 on


on
 the
 cultural
 issues.
 So
 you
 spent
 uh


nearly
 two
 decades
 at
 Scania
 before
 uh


moving
 to
 Germany.
 What
 was
 the
 biggest


kind
 of
 cultural


surprise


>> surprise


>> for
 sweet
 to
 come
 to
 Germany?


Uh
 well
 I


actually
 I
 was
 super
 surprised
 just
 when


they
 called
 me
 if
 I'm
 interested
 in
 the


job
 because
 I
 know
 I
 was
 you
 know
 not


just
 a
 Swede
 but
 also
 a
 woman.
 I
 didn't


speak
 German.
 I'm
 not
 a
 doctor.


I
 was
 younger
 than
 most
 of
 the
 other


people
 in
 those
 kinds
 of
 jobs.
 So


actually
 when
 they
 first
 called
 they


thought
 they
 just
 wanted
 a
 CEO
 for


Sweden
 and
 then
 they're
 like
 no
 no
 it's


the
 global
 it's
 the
 global
 job.


>> So
 why
 do
 you
 think
 they
 call
 you?


>> Um
 I
 think
 they
 wanted
 to
 have
 an


outside
 perspective.
 Uh
 they'd
 realized


kind
 of


somehow
 they
 needed
 to
 shake
 the
 system


a
 little
 bit.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


surprise
 was
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


be
 a
 little
 bit
 maybe
 more
 stiff
 and


more
 old
 school.
 So
 I
 I
 was
 even,
 you


know,
 talking
 to
 my
 husband
 like,
 do
 I


need
 to
 buy
 suits
 now?
 And
 like
 like


actually
 today
 I'm
 wearing
 a
 suit,
 but


that's
 really
 unusual
 for
 me.
 Um,
 and


then
 so
 I
 came
 in
 and
 it
 was
 not
 like


that
 in
 a
 positive
 sense.
 I
 think
 the


other
 thing
 was
 obviously
 I
 knew


especially
 MercedesBenz
 trucks
 as
 a


competitor
 and


I
 always
 view
 them
 as
 like
 super
 strong.


You
 know,
 we
 have
 this


uh
 exhibition
 every
 two
 years
 called
 the


IAA
 and
 we
 would
 always
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 an
 ex
 stand
 and
 you
 know,
 some


trucks
 and
 have
 some
 coffee
 with


customers
 and
 then
 you
 walked
 into
 like


the
 Daimler
 part
 and
 they
 had
 like
 a


whole
 hall.
 It
 was
 like
 a
 kingdom.
 You


could
 walk
 up
 the
 stairs
 and
 you
 could


stand
 and
 like
 look
 at
 the
 Daimler


kingdom.
 So
 I
 thought
 people
 would
 be
 a


little
 bit
 like


that
 style,
 a
 little
 bit
 maybe


overconfident
 and
 and
 uh
 not
 really


interested
 in
 in
 other
 perspectives.
 But


that
 was
 very
 wrong
 in
 a
 in
 a
 positive


sense.


>> So
 when
 I
 came
 in,
 I
 I
 found
 a
 lot
 of


>> curiosity.
 I
 felt
 very
 welcome.
 Um,
 and


I
 think
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 prerequisite


obviously
 to
 get
 in
 and
 get
 stuff
 done.


>> We
 tend
 to
 think
 that
 Germany
 is
 very


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 hierarchy
 in
 German


organizational
 structures.
 How
 do
 you


how
 did
 you
 experience
 that?


>> I
 think
 there
 is
 much
 more
 than
 in
 a


Scandinavian
 company.
 But
 I
 I
 also
 have


the
 experience
 like
 in
 the
 end
 um
 I
 had


another
 cultural
 experience
 because
 I
 I


worked
 in
 Sweden
 many
 years
 and
 then
 I


moved
 to
 Kenya
 and
 I
 did
 this
 cultural


training
 and
 they
 said,
 "Oh,
 now
 you


have
 to
 be
 different.
 You
 cannot
 do
 this


consensus
 and
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 You
 have


to
 be
 more
 directive
 and
 you
 have
 to


tell
 the
 people
 what
 to
 do."
 And
 then
 I


came
 into
 this
 Kenyan
 business
 and
 I


found


You
 know,
 people
 want
 to
 see
 the
 purpose


of
 what
 they
 do.
 They
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of


a
 bigger
 context.
 They
 want
 to
 see


appreciation
 for
 what
 they
 do.


>> Um,
 they
 want
 to
 spend
 their
 time
 like


they
 want
 to
 feel
 when
 they're
 in
 the


office
 or
 in
 the
 factory
 or
 on
 the


workshop
 floor
 that
 what
 they
 do
 is


meaningful
 and
 that
 they're
 spending


their
 time
 in
 a
 good
 way.
 Um
 so
 I
 think


very
 similar
 to
 German
 companies
 it's


like
 there
 is
 some
 hierarchy
 but
 in
 the


end
 people
 want
 to
 do
 meaningful
 things


they
 want
 to
 contribute


>> for
 sure
 there
 were
 more
 things
 coming


to
 the
 CEO
 level
 I
 was
 really
 surprised


in
 the
 beginning
 at
 like
 all
 the
 things


I
 had
 to
 sign
 off
 and
 you
 know
 I
 had
 to


one
 of
 my
 first
 meetings
 when
 I
 came
 in


I
 was
 going
 to
 go
 look
 at
 the
 new
 cab


the
 one
 we
 just
 launched
 now
 a
 couple


months
 ago
 and
 I
 went
 to
 our
 design


center
 and
 we're
 looking
 at
 it
 and
 then


I
 said
 oh
 that's
 nice
 and
 then
 they
 were


all
 looking
 at
 me
 waiting
 for
 something


and
 they're
 like
 you
 have
 to
 approve
 it


formally
 and
 if
 you
 do
 that
 you're
 going


to
 be
 like
 the
 first
 one
 who's
 not
 like


everyone
 always
 comes
 and
 they
 want
 to


change
 a
 little
 thing
 or
 two
 and
 then


I'm
 like
 well
 I'm
 not
 a
 design
 expert
 on


cabs
 so
 I
 trust
 that
 you
 guys
 you
 know


did
 your
 job
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


approve
 this
 because


like
 I'm
 not
 a
 driver.
 I'm
 not
 buying


these
 trucks.
 So,
 you
 should
 be
 asking


our
 customers.
 So,
 I
 think
 stuff
 like


that.


>> Are
 there
 a
 lot
 of
 decisions
 you
 have


pushed
 down
 in
 the
 system?


>> I
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 What
 about
 um
 like
 Sweden
 is


consensus
 driven?
 Uh
 but
 in
 Germany,
 you


have
 very
 high
 uh
 union
 participation,


right,
 in
 decision-m
 and
 at
 board


levels.
 How
 is
 there
 a
 difference
 there?


>> Yeah,
 sure.
 Uh
 this
 is
 obviously


something
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 coming
 into
 to


Daimler
 and
 I
 I
 probably
 made
 some


mistakes
 in
 the
 beginning
 just
 being


super
 rational.
 So
 I
 remember
 there
 was


one
 example
 where
 we
 had
 these
 people


sitting
 in
 each
 of
 our
 spots
 in
 Germany


or
 where
 we
 have
 factories
 receiving


parts
 like
 quality
 defect
 parts
 and


analyzing
 them.
 And
 I
 said,
 you
 know,


let's
 just
 move
 everything
 to
 one
 place


because
 then
 these
 people
 can
 work


together.
 And
 I
 totally
 underestimated,


you
 know,
 it
 it
 matters
 for
 these


different


or
 like
 the
 places,
 the
 towns
 to
 keep


the
 work.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 something
 where
 I


think
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 and
 I
 have
 today
 a


very
 good
 relation
 I
 would
 say
 with
 our


union
 and
 works
 council


>> for
 sure.
 we
 have
 really
 tough
 that's


something
 I
 like
 with
 Germany
 you
 know


it's
 in
 Scandinavia
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 careful
 how
 you
 debate
 with


people
 in
 Germany
 you
 can
 more
 you
 can


go
 headtohead
 uh
 and
 really
 say
 your


opinion
 but
 it's
 not
 personal
 so
 I
 think


that's
 something
 um
 where
 the
 where
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 with
 the
 works
 council
 we


have
 super
 tough
 discussions
 but
 with


the
 people
 in
 diamond
 the
 truck


representing
 that
 side,


they
 also
 just
 want
 what's
 best
 for
 the


company.
 And
 in
 the
 end,
 we
 have


sometimes
 different
 perspective
 on
 how


to
 get
 there,
 but
 we're
 all
 working


because
 we
 want
 to
 be
 successful
 and
 we


want
 this
 company
 to
 exist
 in
 the
 longer


perspective
 in
 the
 50
 and
 100
 years
 from


now.


>> So,
 I
 think
 we
 we
 find
 good
 solutions


and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 as
 complicated
 as


people
 outside
 Germany
 tend
 to
 make
 it.


It's
 just
 another
 group
 that
 you
 need
 to


make
 sure
 you
 align
 with
 and
 find


solutions
 with.


>> I
 mean,
 um,
 if
 you
 really
 think
 about


it,
 it's
 it's
 an
 extraordinary
 situation


that,
 uh,
 here
 there
 is
 a
 young,
 uh,


Swedish
 woman
 coming
 in
 to
 run
 uh,
 kind


of
 a


a
 big
 wellestablished
 uh,
 German
 male


uh,
 dominated
 uh,
 industry.
 What
 um
 what


do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 key
 to
 build
 trust


with
 people
 when
 you
 get
 into
 that
 kind


of
 situation?


>> I
 mean
 for
 me
 I
 was
 also
 the
 first
 woman


in
 many
 different


roles
 and
 so
 on
 in
 Sweden.


>> Um
 so
 I'm
 kind
 of
 used
 to
 it
 but
 I
 think


it's
 to
 come
 in
 uh
 obviously


competence
 speaks
 for
 itself.
 So
 to
 show


that
 you
 know
 what
 you're
 talking
 about.


Um
 I
 also
 had
 the
 benefit
 coming
 into
 my


old
 role
 running
 Mercedes-Benz
 trucks


that
 we
 had
 really
 good
 development.
 So


I
 could
 show
 that
 I'm
 delivering.


>> Um
 we
 we
 went
 from
 I
 think
 4.8%
 return


on
 sales
 my
 first
 year,
 then
 8.1,
 then


10.1
 last
 year.
 A
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a


setback
 due
 to
 low
 markets,
 but
 it's


really
 been
 moving
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 best


way
 to
 to
 build
 trust.
 Uh
 but
 then
 I


think
 also


when
 you
 come
 in
 from
 another
 company
 to


really


try
 to
 avoid
 this
 is
 how
 we
 did
 it
 in


Scania.
 Oh,
 this
 is
 how
 Scanya
 does
 it.


Like
 to
 there
 is
 usually
 a
 reason
 why


companies
 do
 things
 the
 way
 they
 do.
 So


it's
 better
 to
 listen
 and
 to
 understand


why
 and
 not
 try
 to
 copy
 whatever
 worked


in
 another
 company
 because
 people
 get
 so


tired
 I
 think
 of


this
 is
 how
 we
 did
 it.
 This
 is
 the


better
 way.
 So
 rather
 listen
 to


understand
 the
 context
 of
 why
 things
 are


the
 way
 they
 are
 because
 that
 gives
 you


also
 a
 better
 um
 platform
 to
 change
 it


in
 in
 the
 direction
 it
 needs
 to
 go.


>> What
 are
 your
 most
 important
 leadership


principles?
 someone
 who
 worked
 for
 me


some
 years
 ago.
 She
 she
 described
 it


quite
 well.
 Tough
 love,
 she
 said,
 and
 I


thought
 that
 was
 good
 because
 I'm
 quite


demanding.
 H
 it's
 maybe
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 still
 need
 to
 work
 on.
 Like
 I'm


never
 really
 or
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm


unhappy,
 but
 I
 always
 want
 to
 take
 it
 to


the
 next
 level.
 So,
 we
 reached
 like
 a


milestone.
 I'm
 already
 thinking
 about


the
 next
 one


>> and
 I
 could
 probably
 get
 better
 at


showing
 appreciation,
 but
 I'm
 tough.
 So,


always
 pushing
 forward,
 but
 hopefully
 I


do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 also
 show
 that
 I


care
 about
 the
 people
 and
 I
 want
 them
 to


grow
 and
 I
 try
 to
 push
 them
 a
 little
 bit


to
 do
 things
 they
 didn't
 dare
 to
 do,


take
 decisions
 as
 we
 talked
 about,


making
 them
 really
 accountable.
 Um,
 so


that's
 the
 one
 part
 and
 then
 I
 rely
 a


lot
 on
 the
 team


>> probably
 more
 than
 other
 CEOs.
 I
 spend
 a


lot
 of
 time
 consciously
 building
 the


team
 also
 getting
 to
 know
 each
 other


maybe
 not
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 privately


you
 know
 best
 friends
 but
 personally


really
 understanding
 the
 driving
 forces


and
 getting
 to
 the
 level
 where
 you
 can


be
 vulnerable
 with
 each
 other
 and
 kind


of
 get
 power
 from
 the
 team.
 Um
 so
 that's


important
 for
 me.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 look
 at


those
 two
 things,
 given
 that
 you
 have


been
 on
 the
 national
 rowing
 team
 in


Sweden
 for
 several
 years,


>> yeah,


>> and
 rowing
 in,
 you
 know,
 world


championships
 and
 so
 on.
 The
 first
 thing


about
 setting
 new
 goals
 and
 pushing
 to


new
 standards
 and
 so
 on,
 well,
 I'm


sorry,
 this
 is
 a
 leading
 question,
 but


I'm
 sorry.
 Sorry,
 let
 me
 just
 rephrase


it.
 Uh,
 how
 do
 you
 think
 your
 background


in
 sports
 has
 influenced
 your
 leadership


principles?
 if
 you
 do
 the
 first
 one,
 if


you
 do
 the
 first
 one
 first,
 setting
 new


goals
 that
 it's
 pretty
 obvious.
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 where
 I
 learned
 it.


>> And
 it's
 like
 that's
 what
 professional


sports
 is
 all
 about.
 It's
 like
 about


constantly
 pushing


yourself
 to
 the
 next
 level.
 And
 for
 me,


it
 was
 like
 I
 never
 thought
 I
 would
 at


first
 my
 dream
 was
 to
 win
 a
 Swedish


championships.
 And
 then
 I
 reached
 that


very
 quickly.
 my
 brain
 is


reccalibrating.
 I
 want
 to
 make
 the


national
 team
 and
 then
 I
 want
 to
 row
 in


the
 World
 Cup
 and
 stuff.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 just
 how
 I
 work.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 also
 a
 prerequisite
 to
 get


there.
 Um,
 and
 in
 the
 dayto-day
 it's


even
 more
 concrete
 because
 it's
 like,


you
 know,
 you
 do
 something
 brutal


like
 uh
 the
 worst
 thing
 as
 a
 rower
 I


think
 is
 intervals
 on
 the
 rowing
 machine


because
 it's
 very
 digital.
 So
 it
 tells


you
 exactly.
 Um,
 so
 I
 would
 do
 a
 really


hard
 workout
 and
 by
 the
 end,
 you
 know,


you're
 falling
 off
 the
 machine
 lying
 on


the
 floor
 basically


and
 you
 know
 exactly
 how
 you
 perform
 and


then
 you
 go
 back
 next
 week
 and
 you
 can


actually
 do
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 better.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 so
 that's
 comes
 from


there
 and
 that


I
 think
 made
 me
 that's
 also
 what
 makes


it
 fun.
 You
 can
 always
 step
 by
 step
 also


in
 in
 Daimler
 the
 truck
 now
 we
 do
 small


things
 and
 then
 when
 you
 zoom
 out
 over


time
 you
 see
 we're
 really
 moving


>> so
 that
 comes
 from
 the
 rowing
 I
 think.


>> And
 what
 about
 the
 team
 aspect?


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 obviously
 I
 raised
 actually


both.
 It's
 a
 very
 good
 sport
 rowing


because
 it's
 both
 an
 individual
 sport


and
 a
 team
 sport


>> I
 think
 more
 than
 most
 other
 sports


because
 you're
 racing
 in
 a
 in
 a
 team


boat.
 So,
 I
 raced
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 double,


but
 then
 maybe
 later
 in
 the
 day,
 you're


racing
 in
 the
 singles
 against
 each


other.
 So,
 you're
 both
 competitors
 and


teammates.
 And
 uh
 one
 thing
 I
 learned


very
 clearly
 is
 um
 if
 you're
 racing
 in
 a


team
 boat,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 both


physically
 and
 mentally
 fit


because
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 how
 well


prepared
 I
 am
 if
 someone
 else
 is
 sitting


in
 that
 boat
 and
 is
 not
 ready.
 And
 I


think
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 also
 as
 a
 leader


that
 my
 job
 is
 really


to
 enable
 everyone
 else
 to
 be
 fit


mentally
 and
 physically
 and
 to
 work


efficiently.
 That's
 much
 more
 worth
 than


me
 spending
 another
 two
 hours
 in
 the


office,
 you
 know,
 making


ideas
 or
 writing
 notes
 about
 something.


It's
 it's
 much
 more
 important
 that
 the


organization
 is
 healthy
 working
 and


being
 efficient.


>> I
 listened
 to
 a
 podcast
 you
 did,
 I
 think


it
 was
 5
 years
 ago,
 and
 you
 talked
 about


the
 fact
 that
 your
 your
 your
 boss
 had


seen
 the
 potential
 in
 you
 before
 you
 saw


it
 yourself.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 you
 tried
 to
 do
 that
 with
 other


people.
 What's
 the
 key
 to
 doing
 that?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 it's
 honestly
 one


of
 my
 superpowers.


I
 just
 I
 mean
 one
 key
 is
 obviously
 not


to
 think
 too
 much
 about
 the
 CV
 and
 I


just
 realized
 I
 do
 that
 much
 less
 than


most
 others.
 So
 I
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 in


this
 personal
 interaction
 and
 it
 seems
 a


lot
 of
 the
 time
 I'm
 able
 to
 I
 I
 actually


don't
 know
 where
 it
 comes
 from.
 Maybe


it's
 you
 know
 I
 lived
 in
 a
 lot
 of


different
 places
 and
 learned
 a
 lot
 about


different
 cultures
 and
 different


different
 kinds
 of
 people.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 just


get
 a
 good
 feeling
 like
 this
 is
 a
 person


who
 will
 get
 it
 done
 or
 who
 will


influence
 this
 organization
 in
 a


positive
 way.
 Um
 and
 I
 use
 my
 gut


feeling
 really
 a
 lot


>> and
 also
 thinking
 more
 about
 what
 could


they
 get
 done
 than
 what
 are
 they


bringing
 that
 they
 have
 done.


>> How
 do
 you
 work
 with
 your
 gut
 feel?


>> I
 think
 I
 I
 consciously
 listen
 to
 what


it's
 telling
 me.
 Of
 course
 I
 don't.


>> Do
 you
 do
 you
 have
 a
 good
 do
 you
 have
 a


good
 gut
 feel?
 Yeah,
 I
 guess
 so.


So
 far
 so
 good,
 but
 could
 fail
 me
 one


day.


>> Who who
 do
 you
 turn
 to
 for
 advice?


>> I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 people.
 So


definitely
 different
 people
 on
 my
 team


depending
 on
 the
 topic.
 Um,
 I
 have
 a


good
 chairman,
 Joe
 Kesser,
 who
 I
 think


also
 compliments
 me
 because
 the
 stuff


he's
 really
 good
 at
 is
 the
 stuff
 I'm
 not


so
 experienced
 with
 like,


uh,
 public
 affairs,
 um,
 now
 capital


market
 and
 all
 the
 investor
 stuff.
 A
 lot


of
 M&A
 that
 he
 did
 also
 during
 his
 time


in
 Seammens.
 Um,
 so
 him
 I
 I
 ask
 for


advice.
 I
 have
 some
 others.
 Um,
 actually


Jim
 Snape
 is
 is
 one.
 He
 used
 to
 be
 this


CEO
 in
 Germany
 and
 he's
 the
 chairman
 in


in
 Seibans.


So
 he
 understands
 also
 this
 perspective


of
 a
 Scandinavian
 in
 the
 German
 context.


So
 he
 might
 can
 ask
 about
 stuff
 and
 and


then
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 Atlas
 Copco
 so
 asking


other
 board
 members
 there
 for
 advice.


So
 I
 think
 I
 reach
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 for


the
 people
 who
 don't
 know
 Atlascop
 it's


one
 of
 the
 finest
 Swedish
 engineering


companies
 and
 we
 have


>> everyone
 knows
 Atlas
 scope


>> well
 you
 know
 we
 have
 people
 across
 the


world


and
 we
 have
 done
 a
 podcast
 with
 uh
 with


them
 um
 now
 you
 are
 also
 uh
 part
 of


women's
 leadership
 network


>> y


>> why
 is
 that
 important
 or
 is
 that


important


>> yeah
 it's
 important
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all


I
 think
 it's
 also
 being
 kind
 of
 one
 of


the
 first
 women
 not
 just
 in
 this
 job
 but


but
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 jobs.
 I
 I
 see
 it
 as


part
 of
 my
 role
 and
 I
 sometimes
 think
 in


a
 positive
 way
 like
 if
 I
 succeed
 and
 I


deliver


>> it
 will
 open
 the
 door
 for
 other
 women.


>> Um
 because
 yeah
 and
 I
 see
 it
 I
 mean
 I


was
 for
 instance
 the
 first
 woman
 to
 run


the
 bus
 business
 in
 Scania
 and
 after
 me


only
 women.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 just
 opens


people's
 minds.
 But
 I
 also
 I
 did
 a


really
 good
 training
 with
 only
 women
 a


couple
 of
 years
 ago
 called
 women
 for


leaders.


>> And
 first
 I
 was
 super
 skeptical


because
 I
 never
 did
 stuff
 with
 women
 and


I
 wasn't
 even
 used,
 you
 know,
 I
 never


really
 worked
 a
 lot
 with
 women.


>> But
 it
 was
 probably
 there
 that
 I


realized
 truly
 that
 I
 need
 to
 be
 myself.


And
 it's
 this
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,


leadership
 advice
 you
 get
 from,
 oh,
 just


be
 yourself.
 Don't
 try
 to
 be
 somewhere


someone
 else.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 not
 like


that
 was
 new.
 But
 I
 think
 that's
 easier


said
 than
 done.
 And
 I
 think
 during
 that


process
 is
 when
 I
 realized
 the
 strength


of
 being
 who
 I
 am.
 And
 it
 gave
 me
 I


think
 also
 some
 kind
 of
 context


where
 I
 was
 more
 a
 norm


and
 realizing
 also
 the
 strength
 of
 my


leadership
 and
 my
 way
 of
 thinking
 and


leading
 instead
 of
 having
 that
 but


always
 still
 trying
 to
 do
 all
 the
 other


stuff
 that
 I
 saw
 different
 colleagues


do.


>> So
 on
 the
 podcast
 I
 normally
 never
 talk


about
 uh
 gender
 uh
 when
 I
 speak
 to


leaders
 but
 you
 you
 mentioned
 it
 several


times.
 So,
 just
 as
 a
 followup,
 what
 do


you
 think
 are
 the
 advantages
 of
 being
 a


woman
 at
 the
 top
 of
 a
 big
 company?


>> Uh,
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 I


don't
 know
 what
 it
 would
 be
 like
 if
 I


was
 a
 man.
 I
 get
 this
 question
 actually


quite
 often
 and


>> I
 I
 bet
 you
 do,
 but
 you
 normally


wouldn't
 get
 it
 from
 me,
 but
 just
 since


you


>> since
 you
 mentioned
 it,


>> I
 mean,
 what
 are
 the
 person
 Do
 you
 think


there
 are
 some
 gender
 uh
 particular


gender
 qualities?


>> It's
 it's
 hard
 to
 answer
 without


generalizing.
 Yeah.
 But
 what
 I


I
 think
 I'm
 maybe
 it's
 easier
 for
 me
 not


to
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 to
 know
 everything


and
 be
 like
 a
 superhero.
 Um
 I
 found
 a


lot
 of
 male
 CEOs.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 a
 German
 thing.
 I


don't
 think
 so,
 but
 like
 feeling
 like


you
 have
 to
 have
 all
 the
 answers.
 I
 for


me
 it's
 pretty
 easy
 to
 admit
 I
 don't
 and


to
 really
 truly


listen
 to
 what
 experts
 think
 like
 this


example
 with
 the
 design
 of
 the
 cap.


>> Sure.


>> You
 know
 for
 me
 was


>> but
 it
 also
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 confidence
 to


admit
 that
 you
 don't
 know
 something


right.


>> Yeah
 maybe


>> you
 talk
 up
 your
 colleagues
 a
 lot.


>> I
 do
 that
 too.
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 very


important.
 I
 think
 they
 all
 deserve
 it


but
 um
 not
 everybody
 does.
 What
 what
 are


your
 reflections
 about
 that?


>> I
 think
 it's


comes
 very
 natural
 because
 the
 key
 apart


from
 you
 know
 finding
 the
 talent
 and


pushing


people
 to


to
 go
 beyond
 what
 they
 thought
 was


possible.


That's
 what
 makes
 a
 company
 successful


is


>> the
 people.
 Um,
 so


it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 give
 them


credit
 when
 we
 accomplish
 something.


>> I
 also
 think
 I'm
 not
 maybe
 a
 person
 I


don't
 strive
 for,
 you
 know,
 being


famous
 or
 having
 a
 big,
 I
 don't know,


being
 a
 name
 after
 I
 finish
 my
 career.


So
 maybe
 that
 helps.
 It's
 not
 about
 me.


It's
 about
 the
 company
 and
 the
 people
 in


the
 company
 and
 building
 a
 good
 future


for
 the
 company
 and
 of
 course
 for
 the


customers
 and
 so
 on.
 I
 I've
 never


reflected
 on
 it
 actually.


>> Now
 we
 talked
 about
 uh
 we
 talked
 about


the
 batteries
 and
 infrastructure.
 What


is
 your
 personal
 charging
 station?


>> The
 mountains
 I
 would
 say.
 So
 um
 I
 told


you
 I'm
 actually
 on
 holiday
 right
 now.
 I


just
 came
 from
 the
 mountains.
 So


>> absolutely.
 Uh,
 but
 also
 I
 mean
 that's


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 love
 about
 living
 in


South
 Germany.
 So
 we
 are
 two
 hours
 from


the
 Alps.
 I
 go
 there
 almost
 every


weekend.
 Um,


>> why
 is
 that
 important
 for
 you?


>> First
 of
 all,
 it's
 family
 time.
 Um,


second
 of
 all,
 being
 in
 the
 mountains.
 I


mean,
 I
 I
 do
 sports.
 So
 now
 I'm
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 trail
 running


in
 the
 winter,
 crosscountry
 skiing
 or
 or


touring.


that
 both
 makes
 me
 recharged
 because
 I


get
 to
 move
 physically
 um
 and
 also
 just


being
 in
 nature.
 I
 think
 there
 is


something
 special
 about
 that
 makes
 you


not
 think
 about
 work
 and
 I
 believe
 that


actually
 that's
 also
 one
 of
 the


learnings
 from
 rowing
 is
 this
 balance


between
 performance
 and
 recovery
 like


that's
 the
 same
 in
 CEO
 life
 and
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 underestimate
 the


recovery
 part.
 But
 actually
 that's


probably
 as
 important
 as
 delivering
 and


being
 on
 when
 you're
 on
 the
 job
 is


recovering
 and
 recharging


when
 you're
 off
 the
 job.


>> I
 think
 CEO
 stands
 for
 chief
 energy


officer
 and
 so
 you
 also
 need
 you
 also


need
 to
 charge
 to
 be
 able
 to
 deliver


that.


>> Um
 now
 I
 believe
 that
 you
 have
 a
 weekly


ritual
 of
 self-reflection.


>> Yes.


>> How
 does
 that
 work?
 Um
 so
 every
 either


it's
 Friday
 night
 or
 Saturday
 morning
 I


sit
 down
 and
 I
 write
 uh
 what
 happened


uh
 what
 did
 I
 feel
 what
 did
 I
 learn


and
 I
 share
 that
 actually
 with
 someone


who
 I
 did
 this
 training
 with
 Shalot
 um


and
 we've
 been
 doing
 that
 for
 years
 and


I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 way
 both
 to
 really


be
 aware
 of
 like
 what
 happened
 during


the
 week
 did
 I
 accomplished
 what
 I
 what


I
 planned
 also
 what
 did
 I
 learn?
 Um
 and


it's
 also
 a
 way
 to
 let
 go
 of
 the
 week
 to


get
 into
 the
 weekend
 in
 a
 good
 mood.
 Um


and
 I
 yeah
 it
 works
 for
 me
 very
 well.


>> What
 do
 you
 do
 with
 the
 notes?


>> I
 keep
 them
 and
 I


don't
 know
 sometimes
 I
 go
 back
 and
 read


but
 not
 very
 much.
 So
 I
 have
 like
 some


big
 books
 at
 home
 with
 reflections.
 I


know
 one
 other
 person
 who
 does
 this
 and


this
 is
 Albert
 Benny.


>> Okay.


>> At
 Gabberit
 and
 Lonza
 and
 he's
 made
 it


into
 a
 book
 which
 he
 has
 given
 to
 his


daughter.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> So
 perhaps
 that
 could
 be
 something
 for


you.


>> For
 my
 sons,
 maybe
 they
 will
 be


interested
 one
 day.


>> Absolutely.
 What
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people?


>> I
 think
 one
 advice
 I
 would
 have
 needed


to
 hear
 myself
 is
 to
 just
 believe
 in


yourself.


Um


I
 don't
 think
 I
 realized
 that
 I
 could


make
 a
 difference
 in
 the
 world.
 So


also
 coming
 in
 both
 applying
 for
 my


first
 jobs
 and
 coming
 into
 my
 first


jobs,
 I
 didn't
 have
 the
 self-confidence


to
 believe
 I
 could
 contribute.


>> So
 even
 when
 maybe
 this
 gut
 feeling
 was


telling
 me
 things,
 I
 was
 holding
 it


back.
 But
 I
 think
 that's
 this
 energy
 and


the
 clearsightedness
 of
 young
 people
 we


need
 in
 business.
 So
 believe
 in


yourself,
 speak
 up,
 go
 for
 it
 and
 and


really
 dream
 big.
 Anything
 is
 possible.


Usually
 it's
 you
 know
 yourself
 stopping


your
 mind.


Don't
 make
 those
 limits.
 Just
 think
 big.


I
 think
 that's
 a
 wonderful
 place
 to
 um


to
 end.
 Uh
 you
 are
 for
 sure
 one
 of
 the


most
 impressive
 people
 we
 ever
 had
 on


this
 podcast
 and
 very
 very
 personal
 and


I
 could
 easily
 see
 why
 you
 are
 you
 know


uh
 why
 you
 are
 considered
 the
 most


important
 uh
 female
 CEO
 in
 this
 country.


It's
 been
 an
 absolute
 pleasure.
 Big


thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
