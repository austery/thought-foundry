From


the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the
 headlines.


I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's
 Wednesday,


October
 29th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


>> As
 of
 right
 now,
 the
 reports
 that
 are


coming
 in
 are
 catastrophic.


>> In
 Jamaica,
 officials
 say
 that
 Hurricane


Melissa
 left
 a
 swath
 of
 devastation
 as


the
 storm
 cut
 across
 the
 island


yesterday
 with
 winds
 of
 more
 than
 180


mph.
 The
 hurricane
 made
 landfall
 as
 one


of
 the
 strongest
 category
 5
 storms
 on


record,
 knocking
 out
 power
 for
 hundreds


of
 thousands
 of
 people
 and
 cutting
 off


access
 to
 the
 internet.


>> Not
 very
 much
 survives
 a
 category
 5


hurricane
 in
 terms
 of
 infrastructure.


So,
 we
 still
 are
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 and


we're
 just
 praying
 that
 we
 will
 be
 saved


in
 terms
 of
 the
 loss
 of
 lives.
 As
 of


now,
 the
 storm,
 which
 has
 dropped
 to
 a


category
 3,
 is
 tearing
 across
 Cuba,


where
 authorities
 evacuated
 almost


750,000
 people
 ahead
 of
 what
 they
 warned


would
 be
 a
 very
 difficult
 night
 for
 the


country.


Researchers
 say
 that
 hurricanes
 have


been
 growing
 increasingly
 intense,
 in


part
 because
 of
 climate
 change,
 and


Caribbean
 nations
 are
 considered
 to
 be


more
 exposed
 to
 climate
 fueled
 disasters


than
 any
 other
 part
 of
 the
 world.
 In


recent
 years,
 countries
 there
 have
 faced


tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 damage


from
 storms,
 leaving
 most
 of
 them
 in


deep
 debt.


Meanwhile,
 the
 American
 forecasting


teams
 that
 track
 storms
 have
 been


stretched
 thin
 by
 the
 government


shutdown.
 And
 the
 Times
 has
 learned
 that


a
 handful
 of
 retirees
 from
 Noah,
 the


National
 Oceanic
 and
 Atmospheric


Administration,
 have
 volunteered
 to


help.
 Noah's
 so-called
 hurricane
 hunter


planes
 have
 been
 flying
 directly
 into


the
 eye
 of
 Melissa
 to
 gather
 crucial


data
 about
 the
 storm.
 But
 crews
 that


would
 normally
 number
 15
 to
 18
 people


have
 shrunk
 by
 a
 third.
 One
 veteran


scientist
 recently
 returned
 as
 an
 unpaid


intern
 to
 help
 analyze
 data
 from
 the


planes.
 Federal
 forecasting
 services


were
 already
 strained
 by
 mass
 firings


earlier
 this
 year.

In
 Chicago
 yesterday,
 a
 federal
 judge


sharply
 criticized
 a
 senior
 border


patrol
 official
 for
 his
 agency's
 use
 of


force
 in
 the
 city.
 Gregory
 Bo
 has
 become


one
 of
 the
 public
 faces
 of
 the
 Trump


administration's
 immigration
 crackdown


there,
 where
 law
 enforcement
 officers,


including
 Border
 Patrol
 and
 ICE
 agents,


have
 arrested
 at
 least
 3,000
 people,


according
 to
 the
 administration.


On
 multiple
 occasions,
 crowds
 have


gathered
 during
 those
 arrests,
 and
 the


agents,
 including
 Bovino
 himself,
 have


responded
 by
 deploying
 tear
 gas.


Bovino
 was
 in
 court
 because
 a
 coalition


of
 media
 organizations,
 protesters,
 and


clergy
 members
 had
 filed
 a
 lawsuit


accusing
 federal
 agents
 of
 using
 tear


gas,
 and
 other
 tactics
 in
 a
 quote


pattern
 of
 extreme
 brutality
 that
 was


intended
 to
 silence
 the
 press
 and


civilians.
 The
 judge
 had
 previously


barred
 federal
 immigration
 agents
 from


deploying
 tear
 gas
 without
 first
 issuing


two
 warnings
 among
 other
 restrictions.


But
 yesterday
 in
 court,
 she
 said
 that


they've
 appeared
 to
 violate
 those
 rules


multiple
 times.
 She
 said
 agents
 used


tear
 gas
 in
 a
 neighborhood
 where


children
 were
 about
 to
 march
 in
 a


Halloween
 parade
 and
 that
 at
 a
 different


scene
 they
 tossed
 a
 gas
 canister
 out
 of


a
 car
 as
 they
 drove
 away.
 A
 government


lawyer
 said
 border
 patrol
 agents
 use


tear
 gas
 to
 respond
 to
 volatile


situations.
 In
 some
 cases,
 protesters


have
 thrown
 things
 at
 officers
 or
 pushed


them.
 Going
 forward,
 the
 judge
 told


Bovino
 that
 he
 needs
 to
 come
 to
 the


courthouse
 at
 6:00
 p.m.
 every
 weekday
 to


personally
 provide
 her
 with
 a
 report
 on


the
 day's
 arrests
 and
 incidents.


[Music]


Now,
 three
 more
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.


President
 Trump
 is
 continuing
 his
 trip


across
 Asia.
 Today,
 he's
 in
 South
 Korea


meeting
 with
 the
 country's
 leader
 to
 try


and
 finalize
 a
 trade
 deal.
 He
 said


multiple
 times
 he's
 also
 open
 to
 meeting


with
 North
 Korea's
 leader
 to
 try
 and


reopen
 diplomatic
 talks
 with
 the


country,
 though
 there's
 been
 no


response.
 Instead,
 ahead
 of
 Trump's


visit,
 North
 Korea
 test
 fired
 missiles


this
 week
 designed
 to
 carry
 nuclear


weapons.


Also,
 the
 US
 military
 says
 it's
 blown
 up


four
 more
 boats
 it
 claims
 were
 smuggling


drugs
 to
 the
 US,
 killing
 14
 people.


Defense
 Secretary
 Pete
 Hgsth
 said
 the


strikes
 took
 place
 in
 the
 Pacific
 Ocean


on
 Monday
 and
 that
 there
 was
 one


survivor
 who
 was
 rescued
 off
 the
 coast


of
 Mexico.
 Hegs
 has
 framed
 the
 ongoing


boat
 attacks,
 which
 have
 now
 killed
 more


than
 50
 people,
 as
 an
 anti-terror


operation,
 saying,
 quote,
 "These
 narot


terrorists
 have
 killed
 more
 Americans


than
 al-Qaeda,
 and
 they
 will
 be
 treated


the
 same."
 But
 the
 Trump
 administration


has
 provided
 little
 evidence
 to
 support


its
 allegations
 of
 smuggling.
 And
 a


broad
 range
 of
 experts
 on
 military
 use


of
 force
 have
 called
 the
 attacks


illegal.


And
 in
 Washington
 DC,
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 reinstalled
 a
 statue


honoring
 a
 Confederate
 general.
 The


statue,
 which
 was
 torn
 down
 and
 set
 on


fire
 by
 demonstrators
 in
 2020,
 depicts


Albert
 Pike,
 who
 some
 historians
 believe


was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 KKK.
 The


reinstallment
 is
 the
 latest
 victory
 in


Trump's
 effort
 to
 restore
 Confederate


symbols
 in
 public
 spaces.
 It
 comes
 as


the
 president
 has
 been
 leaving
 his
 mark


on
 DC
 more
 broadly.
 He's
 torn
 down
 the


east
 wing
 of
 the
 White
 House
 to
 replace


it
 with
 a
 ballroom,
 unveiled
 plans
 to


build
 a
 giant
 arch
 near
 the
 Lincoln


Memorial,
 and
 has
 now
 fired
 the
 entire


board
 of
 an
 independent
 government


agency
 that
 would
 have
 reviewed
 those


projects.


[Music]


Yesterday,
 Israeli
 Prime
 Minister


Benjamin
 Netanyahu
 ordered
 the
 military


to
 resume
 strikes
 in
 Gaza,
 accusing


Hamas
 of
 violating
 the
 ceasefire.


Explosions
 could
 be
 seen
 over
 the


territory,
 and
 dozens
 of
 people
 were


reportedly
 killed.
 A
 spokesman
 for


Netanyahu
 said
 Hamas
 broke
 the
 truce
 by


attacking
 Israeli
 forces.
 Hamas
 has


denied
 that.
 Israel's
 also
 accused
 Hamas


of
 not
 returning
 all
 of
 the
 bodies
 of


hostages
 who've
 died
 during
 the
 war.


Yesterday,
 the
 Israeli
 military
 released


a
 video
 that
 it
 said
 showed
 Hamas


staging
 the
 discovery
 of
 a
 body,
 burying


then
 unbearing
 a
 white
 body
 bag.
 The


military
 said
 the
 scene
 was
 Hamas's


attempt
 to
 create
 the
 false
 impression


that
 it's
 working
 hard
 on
 recovery


efforts.
 Vice
 President
 JD
 Vance
 said


yesterday
 that
 the
 truce
 is
 still


holding
 despite
 what
 he
 called
 little


skirmishes
 here
 and
 there.


Meanwhile,
 under
 the
 agreement,
 hundreds


of
 trucks
 a
 day
 are
 now
 entering
 Gaza,


allowing
 some
 humanitarian
 groups
 to


distribute
 millions
 of
 meals.
 But
 relief


workers
 say
 it's
 still
 not
 enough
 to


address
 the
 crisis
 there.
 They
 say
 most


of
 what's
 being
 allowed
 into
 the


territory
 appears
 to
 be
 goods
 headed
 to


markets.
 And
 after
 2
 years
 of
 war,
 most


Palestinians
 there
 can't
 afford
 to
 buy


the
 food
 that's
 arriving.


[Music]


And
 finally,


>> wow.
 Wow.
 Wow.
 Look
 at
 this.
 Look
 at


this.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


>> going
 to
 a
 concert
 used
 to
 be
 a
 kind
 of


guessing
 game.
 When
 will
 the
 band
 really


go
 on?
 How
 long
 are
 they
 going
 to
 play


for?
 What
 deep
 cuts
 will
 make
 the
 show?


>> I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 fun


tonight,
 huh?


>> Now
 though,
 like
 all
 things,
 the


internet
 has
 taken
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 mystery


out
 of
 it.
 On
 the
 site
 set
 list
 FM,
 fans


meticulously
 document
 start
 times,
 end


times,
 and
 every
 single
 song
 in
 what


order
 for
 every
 last
 show.
 If
 the
 band


sticks
 to
 roughly
 the
 same
 lineup,
 you


can
 check
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 late


you'll
 be
 out
 or
 even
 when
 to
 take
 a


bathroom
 break
 so
 you
 don't
 miss
 your


favorite
 song.
 This
 kind
 of
 obsessive


documentation
 has
 some
 people
 worried


that
 it's
 sacrificing
 the
 surprise
 of


live
 shows.
 But
 several
 musicians
 the


Times
 talked
 with
 say
 it
 can
 actually


help
 them
 stay
 out
 of
 a
 rut.
 The
 artists


themselves
 check
 the
 site
 to
 make
 sure


they're
 mixing
 up
 their
 lineups
 enough.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 taken
 it
 on
 as
 a
 challenge


to
 keep
 the
 audience
 guessing
 in
 the
 age


of
 the
 internet
 by
 bringing
 out
 surprise


guests.
 For
 the
 record,
 the
 catalog
 of


shows
 on
 set
 list
 FM
 is
 encyclopedic
 and


historical.
 It's
 not
 just,
 you
 know,


what
 Chapel
 Ran
 may
 have
 played
 last


night.
 It's
 what
 the
 Grateful
 Dead


played
 on
 May
 8th,
 1977
 at
 Barton
 Hall.


And
 even
 what
 was
 Mozart's
 lineup
 when


he
 played
 Prague
 on
 September
 6th,
 1791.


[Music]

Trump's
