 All right,
 folks.
 Levi
 Strauss


shares
 they
 are
 trading
 slightly
 lower


today
 after
 dropping
 as
 much
 as
 14%
 on


Friday.
 This
 is
 after
 the
 company's


upgraded
 earnings
 guidance
 still
 fell


short
 of
 higher
 investor
 expectations


following
 the
 stock's
 more
 than
 40%


rally
 heading
 into
 that
 earnings
 print.


Now,
 one
 key
 disappointment,
 at least


according
 to
 analysts
 out
 on
 the
 street,


is
 earnings
 growth
 failing
 to
 match
 the


pace
 of
 sales
 expansion
 due
 to
 tariff


and
 distribution
 costs.
 Meanwhile,
 got


to
 say
 Bailey,
 you
 did
 have
 TD
 Koin


raising
 its
 price
 target
 on
 the
 stock
 to


26
 from
 22
 a
 share
 and
 they've
 got
 their


buy
 rating.


>> Yeah,
 staying
 bullish
 and
 you
 look
 at


the
 street,
 13
 analysts,
 10
 of
 them


buys.
 So,
 is
 it
 a
 sell
 the
 news
 event,


price
 to
 perfection?


>> We
 see.


>> It's
 a
 really
 good
 point.
 So,
 let's
 see


what
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 members
 of


the
 seauite
 have
 to
 say.
 Harmit
 Singh
 is


with
 us,
 chief
 financial
 and
 growth


officer
 at
 Levi
 Strauss.
 He
 joins
 us


from
 our
 San
 Francisco
 bureau.
 Harit,


it's
 so
 good
 to
 have
 you
 here
 with
 us.


How
 are
 you
 and
 how
 is
 the
 consumer


doing?


>> Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 Carolyn


Bailey.
 Um,
 it's
 great
 to
 be
 here
 again.


Um,
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 a
 real
 strong


quarter,
 four
 consecutive
 quarters
 of


high
 singledigit
 growth
 and
 record
 gross


margins
 as
 well
 as
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 were


able
 to
 raise
 our
 fullear
 guidance


as
 well
 as
 gross
 margin
 and
 EPS


expectations.
 U
 overall
 as
 a
 company


we're
 a
 stronger
 and
 a
 higher
 performing


company
 defined
 by
 accelerated
 growth,


expanding
 margins
 and
 higher
 return
 on


invested
 capital.
 to
 your
 question
 about


the
 consumer,
 the
 consumer
 is
 largely


being
 resilient.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 our


products
 are
 really
 well
 segmented.
 Uh,


you
 know,
 we
 have
 blue
 tab
 which
 we


which
 is
 our
 premium
 high
 pinnacle


product
 and
 that's
 doing
 well.
 We've


introduced
 that
 in
 the
 US.
 Uh,
 so
 far
 so


good.
 We
 have
 a
 red
 tab
 product
 that
 is


basically
 marketed
 to
 consumers
 who
 earn


between
 100,000
 and
 over.
 And
 that's
 you


know
 based
 on
 our
 results
 really
 done


well.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 a


signature
 product
 sold
 through
 Walmart


that
 again
 had
 a
 banner
 cord
 and
 that's


for
 you
 know
 lower
 income
 consumers.
 So


consumer
 strength
 really
 strong
 that's


where
 we
 were
 able
 to
 raise
 the
 full


year
 guidance
 and
 our
 product
 pipeline


hasn't
 been
 stronger.
 Now
 if
 you
 go


outside
 the
 uh
 the
 US
 and
 international


business
 was
 up
 in
 the
 high
 single
 digit


and
 so
 Asia
 had
 a
 strong
 quarter


consumer
 strong.
 Europe
 had
 a
 decent


quarter
 consumer
 in
 a
 better
 place
 and


so
 is
 Latin
 America.


>> Well
 I'm
 just
 going to
 lay it
 out
 for


you.
 I
 think
 I
 bought
 my
 first
 pair
 of


Levis's
 uh
 in
 a
 long
 time
 just
 a
 couple


of
 months
 ago
 and
 my
 daughter
 who's
 22


so
 much
 younger
 than
 me
 has
 been
 buying


Levis's
 for
 a
 while.
 So
 Bailey
 I
 mean


they're
 back.
 I
 go
 into
 the
 store
 in


downtown
 in
 uh
 uh
 in
 the
 village
 and


yeah
 it's
 packed.


>> Well,
 you
 get
 a
 partnership
 with


Beyonce.
 All
 the
 marketing
 you
 guys
 are


spending
 in
 terms
 of
 targeting
 both


young
 and
 older
 generations.
 But
 Har,
 I


want
 to
 ask
 about
 tariffs.
 So,
 Levi


expects
 tariffs
 from
 China
 about
 30%
 but


increased
 expectations
 to
 20%
 from
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world.
 Where
 are
 you


sourcing
 your
 genes
 materials?
 Is
 it


more
 are
 you
 more
 exposed
 to
 that


doubling
 in
 terms
 of
 are
 you
 getting


materials
 from
 Vietnam
 in
 place
 of


China?


>> Yeah.
 So
 overall
 we're
 taking
 a
 holistic


approach
 as
 we
 are
 able
 to
 offset
 the


tariff
 impact.
 Um
 you
 know
 as
 you
 think


about
 this
 year
 we
 raise
 guidance
 in
 the


top
 line
 and
 the
 bottom
 line
 and
 gross


margin.
 So
 you
 know
 we've
 been
 able
 to


withstand
 that.
 To
 your
 specific


question,
 Bailey,
 um
 we
 source
 about
 1%


uh
 we
 import
 into
 the
 US
 from
 China,
 a


little
 over
 a
 percent
 from
 India.
 Most


of
 and
 Vietnam
 is
 in
 the
 mid
 to
 high


single
 digits.
 So
 most
 of
 our
 imports


are
 from
 the
 Southeast
 Asian
 countries.


Think
 Bangladesh,
 think
 Pakistan
 and
 and


uh
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 Asia.
 The
 way
 we


think
 about
 our
 supply
 chain,
 it's


fairly
 well
 diversified.
 We
 import
 from


about
 20
 countries
 into
 the
 US.
 60%
 of


our
 business
 is
 outside
 the
 US.
 And
 so


we're
 well
 positioned
 to
 mitigate
 and


offset
 tariffs.
 And
 the
 way
 we're


thinking
 about
 the
 holistic
 approach


given
 that
 volume
 is
 driving
 a
 big
 piece


of
 our
 um
 you
 know
 revenue
 momentum
 and


we
 have
 tenured
 um
 vendor
 relationships.


We're
 working
 with
 our
 vendors.
 We're


looking
 at
 different
 cost
 uh


efficiencies
 across
 our
 organization
 as


well
 as
 you
 know
 being
 very
 thoughtful


about
 pricing.


>> So
 let
 me
 just
 ask
 you
 though
 you
 guys


did
 you
 know
 you
 mentioned
 you
 raised


your
 fullear
 um
 outlook.
 You
 did
 warn


that
 tariffs
 are
 starting
 to
 bite
 profit


profitability
 to
 measure
 by
 gross


margins
 improved.
 So
 these
 are
 like
 good


stuff
 but
 again
 that
 tariffs
 are


starting
 to
 bite.
 Um
 Hermit
 can
 you
 tell


us
 what
 that
 means?
 what
 the
 bite
 of


tariffs
 um
 when
 when
 how
 much
 you
 know


any
 color
 around
 that.


>> Sure.
 So
 you
 know
 overall
 you
 know
 we


were
 able
 to
 raise
 topline
 and
 bottom


line
 uh
 guidance
 despite
 absorbing


tariffs
 and
 so
 we
 are
 able
 to
 mitigate


it.
 Uh
 to
 the
 question
 about
 tariffs
 um


u
 you
 know
 tariffs
 were
 introduced
 on


liberation
 day.
 We
 normally
 buy
 our


products
 you
 know
 six
 months
 in
 advance


and
 so
 um
 you
 know
 we
 are
 working


through
 um
 you
 know
 our
 efforts
 and


we've
 got
 different
 levers
 uh
 to
 kind
 of


position
 it.
 So
 you
 take
 quarter
 three,


the
 the
 quarter
 we
 just
 reported,
 gross


margins
 are
 record.
 So
 we're
 able
 to


offset
 tariffs
 because
 we
 got
 other


things
 working
 for
 us,
 you
 know,
 as
 we


grow
 our
 women's
 business,
 our
 direct
 to


consumer
 business
 and
 international
 all


of
 which
 are
 accretive
 to
 gross
 margins


and
 allow
 us
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 mitigate
 and


and
 offset
 some
 of
 the
 tariff
 exposure.


uh
 quarter
 four
 we
 did
 guide
 gross


margins
 to
 be
 slightly
 down
 versus
 a


year
 ago
 and
 had
 it
 not
 been
 for
 tariffs


you
 know
 we'd
 have
 grown
 gross
 margins


but
 overall
 as
 we
 think
 about
 the
 year


we'll
 we'll
 report
 again
 another
 year
 of


record
 gross
 margins
 so
 we're
 working
 on


levers
 for
 2026


the
 good
 news
 is
 we'll
 end
 the
 year


stronger
 and
 we
 believe
 we're
 well


positioned
 to
 have
 another
 strong
 year


in
 2026


>> and
 Carol
 we've
 talked
 with
 a
 good


friend
 Peter
 Atwater
 for
 quite
 some
 time


K-shaped
 recovery
 where
 people
 who
 are


well
 off


in
 the
 bottom
 quintile


when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 goods
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 ability
 to
 raise
 prices
 from


the
 impact
 of
 tariffs
 which
 products
 are


you
 able
 to
 more
 easily
 raise
 prices


where
 you
 aren't
 going
 to
 see
 consumers


push
 away
 and
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 about


that
 strategy
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 say
 the


jeans
 that
 you
 do
 sell
 through
 a
 Walmart


where
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 gross
 margin


going
 direct
 to
 consumer
 and
 you
 do
 have


likely
 uh
 at least
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the


data
 a
 consumer
 who's
 feeling
 a
 pinch
 of


inflation
 broadly
 speaking.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 Bailey
 to


your
 question
 is
 our
 products
 are
 well


segmented
 depending
 on
 the
 um
 income


profile
 of
 different
 consumers.
 I
 talk


blue
 tab,
 red
 tab
 and
 signature.
 Uh


signature
 is
 what's
 uh
 sold
 into
 the


lower
 income
 consumer.
 We've
 been
 very


thoughtful
 about
 pricing.
 We're
 leading


with
 product
 innovation
 rather
 than


price.
 And
 so
 we're
 doing
 what
 we
 can
 to


maintain
 a
 price
 point.
 It
 was
 evident


in
 quarter
 3.
 Signature,
 for
 example,
 I


think
 is
 up
 in
 the
 low
 double
 digits
 for


the
 year.
 As
 we
 think
 about,
 you
 know,


our
 other
 products,
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us


is
 our
 product
 pipeline
 has
 never
 been


stronger.
 You
 know,
 we
 leading
 with


loose
 and
 baggy
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time


selling
 a
 lot
 of
 slim
 and
 skinny.
 Uh


both
 for
 him
 and
 her.
 you
 know,
 we've


got
 wonderful
 uh
 you
 know,
 waist
 up
 uh


products
 to
 think
 trucker
 jackets,
 think


linen
 shirts,
 etc.,
 etc.
 And
 so,
 as
 a


company,
 we're
 making
 this
 uh
 pivot
 to


be
 more
 of
 a
 denim
 lifestyle
 uh
 retailer


going
 forward.
 Our
 past
 was
 all
 about


denim.
 Our
 future
 is
 going
 to
 be
 about


denim
 lifestyle.


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 know,
 do
 you
 really
 have


a
 pair
 of
 baggy
 barrel
 jeans?
 I
 I
 can't


get
 my
 head
 around
 them.
 I'm
 trying.
 I'm


trying.
 I'm
 just
 I
 haven't
 done
 it.
 I


haven't
 done
 it.
 Um
 Army,
 what
 I
 do
 want


to
 ask
 you
 too
 is
 you
 guys
 have
 had
 kind


of
 a
 mission
 a
 goal
 to
 get
 to
 10
 billion


in
 sales
 by
 2027.
 I
 think
 you
 may
 have


adjusted
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 think
 also
 a


15%
 EBIT
 margin.
 Could
 you
 reach
 15%
 in


the
 next
 few
 years
 even
 if
 sales
 have


not
 hit
 that
 10
 billion?
 You
 know,
 talk


to
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that
 mission.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 you
 know,
 we
 gave
 out
 the


expectation
 of
 10
 billion
 and
 15%
 um
 on


our
 investor
 day
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 June


2022.


Since
 then,
 you
 know,
 there's
 been
 a
 lot


of
 change
 um
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty.


As
 a
 company,
 we've
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,


navigated
 our
 way
 through
 uncertainty.


We
 haven't
 given
 our
 new
 date
 on
 the
 10


billion
 and
 the
 20
 and
 the
 and
 the
 15%.


Mhm.


>> are
 are
 thinking
 is
 we
 probably
 do
 that


sometime
 next
 year.
 But
 to
 your


question,
 the
 company
 that
 we
 are


building
 and
 the
 company
 that
 is
 got
 the


foundation
 given
 where
 we
 ending
 this


year.
 So
 you
 take
 20
 2025,
 we'll
 end
 at


about
 6%
 organic
 growth.
 Last
 year
 it


was
 3%.
 The
 year
 before
 that
 it
 was


flat.
 Um
 if
 you
 think
 in
 EBIT
 margins,


this
 year
 we'll
 end
 about
 mid
 11s.
 Last


year
 it
 was
 in
 the
 mid
 10s.
 The
 previous


year
 it
 was
 about
 9.
 So
 we've
 seen
 a


steady
 progress
 and
 our
 view
 is
 we


probably
 get
 to
 the
 15%
 faster
 than
 we


get
 to
 the
 10
 billion
 but
 uh
 but
 really


a
 company
 that
 is
 steadily
 um
 delivering


mid-s
 singledigit
 growth
 uh
 in
 a


category
 that
 probably
 grows
 a
 little


you
 know
 south
 of
 that.
 So
 our
 view
 is


that
 we
 will
 we
 are
 market
 leaders
 now


in
 the
 US
 number
 one
 in
 men's
 number
 one


in
 women's
 and
 really
 resonating
 with


the
 youth.
 And
 so
 the
 question
 is
 if


you're
 able
 to
 uh
 stay
 at
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


and
 implement
 our
 strategies
 our
 view
 is


we
 can
 continue
 to
 be
 market
 leader
 and


probably
 pick
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 share


especially
 because
 the
 denim
 category
 is


accelerating.
 We've
 seen
 the


acceleration
 in
 the
 US.
 We've
 seen
 the


acceleration
 outside
 and
 that's
 largely


driven
 by
 the
 world
 becoming
 more


casual.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 more
 jeans
 in
 my
 wardrobe


than
 I've
 ever
 had
 in
 like
 since
 high


school.
 Like
 it's
 really
 kind
 of
 wild.


Anyway,
 Bailey,
 I
 know
 you've
 got


another
 question.


>> Well,
 I
 was
 just
 going
 to
 ask
 in
 terms


of
 geographic
 expansion
 when
 you
 think


about
 China,
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 China?


And
 also,
 what
 products
 do
 the
 Chinese


consumers
 want?
 Is
 it
 that
 high-end
 good


or
 is
 it
 more
 of
 a
 bargain
 purchase?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 China
 for
 us
 is
 still


underpenetrated.
 Um,
 China
 represents


about
 2
 or
 3%
 of
 our
 business.
 Um,
 you


know,
 our
 business
 in
 China
 has
 been


slow
 and
 soft.
 The
 Chinese
 consumer


right
 now
 is
 going
 through
 a,
 you
 know,


a
 bit
 of
 a
 macro
 uncertain
 climate.
 Um,


uh,
 but
 the
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is
 they


love
 the
 brand.
 Um,
 our
 brand
 equity


scores
 are
 really
 solid.
 We
 think
 China


can
 be,
 you
 know,
 a
 business
 that
 grows


double
 digit
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 But
 to


your
 specific
 question,
 the
 Chinese


consumer
 is
 fairly
 discerning
 on
 the


brands
 he
 or
 she
 gravitate
 to.
 There
 is


a
 high-end
 consumer
 as
 well
 as
 a


consumer
 that
 li
 the
 mid-market
 consumer


what
 we
 call
 the
 core
 product.
 So
 if
 you


think
 about
 our
 Asia
 strategy,
 we


really,
 you
 know,
 our
 products
 are


relevant
 for
 the
 mid-market
 consumer


while
 we
 also
 offer
 products
 for
 the
 um


higher
 premium
 end
 consumer.
 30%
 of
 the


Asian
 denim
 category
 is
 premium
 and
 you


know
 premium
 for
 example
 our
 highest


pinnacle
 product
 is
 largely
 Japanese
 uh


you
 know
 fabric
 Japanese
 denim
 and
 um


inspired
 uh
 by
 salvage
 and
 so
 that's


what
 we
 are
 selling
 and
 I
 think
 over


time
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 start
 growing
 our


China
 business
 back
 into
 in
 the
 low


double
 digit
 range.
 Yeah,
 interesting.


Seth,
 I
 will
 say,
 Carol,
 I
 know
 you


mentioned
 you
 have
 more
 jeans
 than
 ever.


I
 have
 been
 buying
 the
 sherpa
 jackets,


the
 denim
 jackets
 like
 crazy.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 I
 have
 three
 of
 them
 in


different
 colors.


>> I
 bought
 a
 bunch
 of
 denim
 jackets.


>> That's
 what
 I'm
 in.
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't


wear
 jeans.
 I
 wear
 chinos,
 but
 I
 wear


the
 the
 denim
 jackets
 like
 crazy.


>> I
 know.
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 love
 it.


I
 love
 it.
 Ask
 like
 everybody
 I
 work
 I


walk
 jeans
 every
 morning.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Bailey
 and
 and
 Carol,
 now


we've
 got
 the
 blue
 tab.
 It's
 um
 it's


it's
 a
 fuller
 jacket.
 Um
 you
 can


definitely
 wear
 it
 to
 office
 depending


on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


dress
 uh
 environment
 uh
 at
 Bloomberg.
 I


walked
 in
 here
 fairly
 casual.
 So
 you


know
 it's
 something
 that
 we
 are
 now


beginning
 to
 offer
 which
 should
 make


your
 wardrobe
 at
 some
 stage.


>> Um
 hey
 one
 last
 question.
 Does
 it
 feel


like
 God
 the
 it's
 been
 a
 crazy
 year
 uh


and
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 coming
 at
 everybody


investors
 the
 world
 at
 large.
 Does
 it


feel
 like
 things
 are
 starting
 to
 calm


down
 on
 a
 day
 when
 we've
 talked
 about


what
 seems
 like
 progress
 in
 a
 ceasefire


between
 Israel
 and
 Hamas?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 um,
 as
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 lived
 through


uncertainty.


Um,
 you
 know,
 the
 good
 news
 for
 us
 is


the
 category
 strong.
 We
 have
 real


business
 momentum.
 The
 brand's
 never


been
 stronger
 and
 we
 have
 a
 product


pipeline
 that
 is
 never
 been
 fuller


especially
 as
 we
 head
 towards
 holiday.


You
 know,
 our
 focus
 right
 now
 is
 making


sure
 our
 product
 is
 on
 the
 on
 the
 floor


when
 the
 because
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 Carol


is
 consumers
 gravitate
 to
 newness
 and


gravitate
 to
 what's
 relevant
 and
 um
 you


know
 and
 you
 know
 um
 our
 view
 is
 if
 we


can
 offer
 the
 right
 product
 and
 build
 a


brand
 experience
 and
 that's
 why
 we've


got
 real
 focus
 on
 our
 direct
 to
 consumer


business
 while
 complementing
 growth
 with


our
 wholesale
 business.
 So
 this
 quarter


um
 you
 know
 both
 DDC
 and
 wholesale
 was


up.
 We
 had
 in
 the
 US
 five
 consecutive


quarters
 of
 high
 growth
 and
 it's
 fueled


by
 both
