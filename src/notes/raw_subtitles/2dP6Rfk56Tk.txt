Hey,
 it's
 Natalie.
 Taking
 a
 quick
 second


here
 because
 we
 here
 at
 the
 Daily
 are


working
 on
 a
 fun
 little
 project.


Something
 that
 we'll
 share
 later
 as
 a


special
 bonus
 episode
 for
 New
 York
 Times


subscribers.
 The
 idea
 is
 simple.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 talking
 to
 our
 fascinating


colleagues
 here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times


about
 who
 they
 are
 and
 how
 they
 do
 their


jobs.
 And
 as
 a
 part
 of
 that
 project,
 we


want
 to
 hear
 from
 you.
 What's
 the
 one


question
 you've
 had
 for
 our
 colleagues


but
 never
 gotten
 the
 chance
 to
 ask?
 We


started
 with
 games
 and
 now
 we're
 going


to
 go
 to
 the
 Times
 restaurant
 critics,


Tel
 Ralph
 and
 Lega
 Michon.
 They're
 both


new
 to
 the
 job
 and
 they've
 brought
 a
 lot


of
 exciting
 changes.
 One
 is
 in


California,
 the
 other
 one's
 in
 New
 York


City.
 They're
 no
 longer
 dining


anonymously
 and
 they're
 reviewing


restaurants
 all
 over
 the
 country.
 I


personally
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 questions
 for


them,
 like
 how
 are
 they
 going
 to
 get


fair
 service
 from
 restaurants?
 How
 do


they
 know
 they're
 not
 getting
 treated


differently
 than
 us
 regular
 folks?
 How


do
 they
 pick
 where
 to
 go?
 And
 also,
 most


importantly,
 what's
 their
 most


controversial
 food
 take?
 Get
 us
 your


questions,
 please,
 by
 leaving
 a
 message


at
 2125564000.


Again,
 that's
 2125564000.


Okay,
 here's
 the
 show.


From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.
 The
 world's


biggest
 museum,
 a
 symbol
 of
 France,
 now


a
 crime
 scene.


>> Over
 the
 weekend,
 a
 group
 of
 thieves


staged
 a
 remarkable
 heist
 at
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 famous
 museums.
 Officials


in
 Paris
 say
 the
 masked
 crooks
 used
 a


basket
 lift
 and
 cutting
 tools
 to
 just


break
 into
 a
 gallery,


>> stealing
 some
 of
 the
 most
 precious
 and


culturally
 significant
 jewels
 in
 Europe


in
 the
 middle
 of
 Paris
 in
 broad


daylight.


>> It's
 like
 a
 scene
 from
 a
 film.


>> Yeah.
 You
 could
 not
 make
 it
 up.
 I


thought
 it
 was
 a
 joke,
 like
 no,
 not


possible.


>> As
 new
 details
 emerge
 about
 the
 brazen


theft
 at
 the
 Louvre,
 the
 response
 in


France
 has
 been
 a
 mix
 of
 shock,


disbelief,
 and
 fascination.


>> This
 is
 the
 heist
 of
 the
 decade.
 You


know,
 it's
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 gets.


>> How
 could
 the
 world's
 most
 visited


museum
 be
 robbed
 with
 such
 brazen


audacity?
 Today,
 my
 colleague
 Katherine


Porter
 explains
 how
 the
 robbery
 happened


and
 why
 so
 many
 feel
 as
 though
 they
 may


have
 just
 lost
 a
 piece
 of
 their
 history


for
 good.


[Music]


It's
 Wednesday,
 October
 22nd.


>> Catherine,
 hi.


>> How
 are
 you?
 This
 is
 probably
 the
 only


taping
 where
 I've
 literally
 been
 like,
 I


need
 us
 to
 begin
 so
 I
 can
 ask
 my


questions
 right
 now.


I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 true.
 It's
 not
 the


only
 one,
 but
 this
 is
 a
 very
 special


episode
 and
 I
 need
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about


this
 story.
 I
 have
 read
 everything
 about


this
 heist
 and
 I'm
 not
 satisfied
 still.


>> I
 am
 I
 am
 ready
 for
 you.


>> Okay,
 good.
 Just
 to
 start,
 tell
 me


exactly
 how
 a
 group
 of
 jewel
 thieves


broke
 into
 the
 Louve
 and
 stole
 these


very
 precious
 items.
 Just
 start
 from
 the


beginning.
 Tell
 me
 exactly
 what


happened.
 As
 far
 as
 we
 know,


>> as
 far
 as
 we
 know,
 this
 started
 at
 9:30


last
 Sunday
 morning.


Typical
 kind
 of
 quiet
 Paris
 morning.
 And


what
 we
 know
 is
 this
 truck
 that
 had
 a


ladder
 attached
 to
 it
 rolls
 up
 to
 the


Louv
 with
 two
 motorcycles.


Now
 you
 might
 wonder
 why
 is
 there
 a


truck
 with
 a
 ladder
 on
 it,
 but
 in
 Paris


it's
 pretty
 common
 sight
 cuz
 this
 is
 how


you
 move
 your
 furniture
 in
 and
 out
 of


your
 apartments
 because
 of
 how
 skinny


the
 halls
 are.
 M.


>> So,
 um,
 it
 rolls
 up,
 parks
 right
 up


against
 the
 building
 on
 the
 sidewalk
 and


two
 people
 pop
 out
 and
 they
 set
 out


traffic
 pylons
 around
 the
 truck
 and
 they


have
 fluorescent
 vests
 on
 like
 public


workers
 do.


>> So,
 like
 anybody
 looking
 at
 this
 from


the
 outside
 might
 think
 this
 is
 a


completely
 normal
 scene.
 Nothing
 to
 see


here.
 Nothing
 necessarily
 to
 see
 except


for
 the
 two
 men
 that
 then
 went
 up
 this


electric
 ladder
 to
 the
 balcony
 on
 the


second
 floor
 were
 masked.


So
 that
 might
 have
 tipped
 you
 off
 if
 you


were
 there.
 But
 to
 be
 honest,
 this
 is


the
 quiet
 side
 of
 the
 Louv.
 It's
 near


the
 Sen.
 Not
 a
 lot
 of
 foot
 traffic.
 So


they
 go
 up
 the
 uh
 mechanical
 elevator
 in


a
 kind
 of
 bucket,
 like
 a
 cherry
 picker.


They
 get
 to
 this
 balcony
 onto
 the
 second


floor
 of
 the
 Louve
 and
 they
 use
 what
 are


known
 as
 angle
 grinders,


>> which
 is
 what
 exactly?


>> Kind
 of
 like
 a
 electric
 hand
 saw.


>> Okay.


>> To
 saw
 through
 the
 window
 that
 leads


into
 what's
 known
 as
 the
 Apollo
 gallery.


It's
 this
 golden
 long
 beautiful


uh
 wing
 of
 the
 Louve
 that
 literally
 was


built
 by
 Louis
 the
 14th
 as
 a
 model
 for


his
 hall
 of
 mirrors
 and
 it
 houses
 the


royal
 jewels
 of
 France.


Is
 this
 like
 a
 very
 popular
 part
 of
 the


Lou?
 It
 certainly
 sounds
 as
 though
 it's


iconic.


super
 iconic.
 It's
 not
 as
 popular


obviously
 as
 the
 Mona
 Lisa,


>> but
 it's
 pretty
 close.
 You
 know,
 when


you
 go
 in
 there,
 it's
 often
 quite


crowded.
 It's
 really
 opulent.
 There's


paintings
 on
 the
 ceilings,
 on
 the
 walls


by
 famous
 people
 like
 Deloqua.
 There
 are


hanging
 tapestries.
 There
 are
 um


sculptures
 and
 these
 cases
 down
 the


middle
 that
 hold
 the
 crown
 jewels.
 the


the
 thieves
 break
 in
 using
 this
 saw.
 We


hear
 from
 people
 who
 work
 in
 the
 Louve


that
 there
 was
 an
 explosion
 of
 glass
 and


there
 were
 a
 number
 of
 security
 guards


inside
 who
 really
 quickly
 evacuated
 the


room.


>> So,
 they
 didn't
 approach
 the
 thieves.


>> No.
 The
 protocol
 in
 the
 Louvre
 and
 most


museums
 is
 if
 you
 are
 confronted
 with
 an


intruder
 that
 had
 things
 that
 seem
 like


they
 could
 be
 weapons,
 your
 priority
 is


protect
 people.
 So
 they
 did
 what
 they


were
 instructed
 to
 do,
 what
 they've
 been


trained
 to
 do.
 They
 got
 people
 out
 and


very,
 very
 quickly.
 And
 how
 many
 people


were
 there
 at
 the
 time?
 I
 mean,
 9:30


a.m.
 on
 a
 Sunday
 does
 not
 seem
 like
 the


ideal
 time
 to
 rob
 the
 most
 famous
 museum


in
 the
 world.
 Was
 it
 crowded?
 Well,
 we


don't
 know
 how
 many
 people
 were
 in
 that


room.
 That's
 like
 one
 of
 the
 details


that
 has
 not
 surfaced
 yet
 or
 been


disclosed
 by
 investigators.
 We
 do
 know


that
 the
 Louv
 is
 like
 the
 most
 visited


museum
 in
 the
 world.
 Up
 to
 30,000
 people


visit
 every
 day.
 We've
 seen
 videos
 and


spoken
 to
 people
 who
 were
 quite
 frantic


not
 knowing
 why
 they
 were
 being


evacuated.
 Many
 were
 running
 to
 get
 out.


I
 mean,
 there
 was
 huge
 fear
 at
 first


that
 either
 there
 was
 a
 fire
 or
 this
 was


a
 terrorist
 attack.


>> So,
 the
 thieves
 are
 inside.
 What
 happens


next?


>> What
 we
 know
 is
 that
 they
 go
 like


directly
 to
 two
 cases
 that
 are
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 line
 of
 cases
 and
 they
 use


their
 power
 saws
 to
 cut
 into
 them
 and


break
 them
 open.


>> I
 had
 heard
 there
 was
 some
 video
 footage


taken
 of
 the
 thieves
 stealing
 the


pieces.
 Do
 we
 know
 anything
 about
 how


they
 were
 acting,
 what
 they
 were
 doing,


their
 general
 demeanor
 at
 the
 time?


>> Yeah,
 we've
 seen
 those
 videos.
 They
 were


given,
 I
 guess,
 to
 a
 local
 French
 TV


station.
 They're
 quite
 blurry,
 but
 you


see
 clearly
 one
 of
 the
 two
 men
 wearing


something
 over
 his
 head,
 like
 a
 black


covering
 on
 his
 head.
 He's
 got
 his


yellow
 vest
 on,
 and
 he's
 just
 he
 looks


incredibly
 calm,
 like
 there's
 no


franticness.
 He's
 just
 sawing
 away.
 You


know
 what
 we
 have
 been
 told
 by
 the
 chief


Paris
 prosecutor
 who
 is
 in
 charge
 of


leading
 the
 investigation
 into
 this
 is


that
 these
 are
 seasoned.
 They
 think
 that


they're
 part
 of
 a
 gang.
 They
 clearly


knew
 what
 they
 were
 coming
 for.
 They


were
 pretty
 precise
 and
 fast
 and
 they


didn't
 seem
 panicked
 at
 all.
 But
 all


this
 was,
 you
 know,
 fairly
 quick.


>> Our
 timeline
 shows
 that
 they
 arrived


outside
 the
 building
 at
 9:30.
 They
 got


up
 to
 that
 window
 on
 the
 top
 of
 the


mechanical
 ladder.
 Four
 minutes
 later,


they
 broke
 in
 and
 they
 were
 out
 within


four
 minutes
 and
 down
 and
 gone.
 So,
 um,


>> amazing.


>> That's
 pretty
 fast.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 in


terms
 of
 heists,
 it's
 not
 the
 fastest.


There
 have
 many
 faster.
 People
 who
 study


this
 stuff
 say
 it's
 not
 crazy
 fast,
 but


it
 was
 fast
 enough
 that
 they
 escaped
 and


uh,
 they
 have
 not
 been
 found.
 So,
 okay,


let's
 talk
 about
 that
 escape.
 I'm
 trying


to
 imagine
 it.
 What
 does
 it
 actually


look
 like?


>> You
 know,
 they
 jump
 out
 the
 window
 that


they
 came
 in.
 They
 go
 down
 the
 same


bucket
 um
 ladder
 to
 the
 bottom.
 We


understand
 also
 that
 they
 at
 this
 point


attempt
 to
 um
 set
 fire
 to
 the
 truck
 to


the
 bucket
 itself.
 We
 don't
 know
 why.


There's
 been
 lots
 of
 speculation
 they


were
 trying
 to
 remove
 any
 kind
 of
 DNA
 or


fingerprints
 basically.
 And
 at
 this


point,
 what
 we
 know
 is
 that
 some


security
 guard
 or
 guards
 come
 chasing


towards
 them
 on
 the
 ground.
 They
 drop
 a


couple
 things,
 including
 one
 of
 their


security
 vests
 and
 the
 bottle
 that
 they


were
 using
 to
 spray
 gas
 onto
 the
 this


cherry
 bin
 to
 light
 it
 on
 fire.
 and
 they


jump
 on
 the
 back
 of
 two
 waiting


motorcycles
 and
 speed
 away.


One,
 you
 know,
 very
 juicy
 detail
 is
 that


they
 dropped
 one
 of
 the
 nine
 things
 they


originally
 grabbed.
 I
 read
 that


>> and
 it
 was
 this
 incredibly
 precious


crown,
 an
 imperial
 crown
 that
 was
 made


for
 the
 last
 empress
 of
 France
 who
 was


married
 to
 Napoleon
 III.
 I
 can
 tell
 you


a
 little
 bit
 about
 it.
 I
 have
 been


learning
 a
 ton
 about
 these
 type
 of


things.


>> You're
 like
 the
 world's
 expert
 in
 crown


jewels
 now.


>> Well,
 not
 before
 this,
 but
 I
 have
 become


one.
 Hold
 on.
 So,
 this
 crown
 had
 eight


golden
 eagles
 on
 it.
 1,354


regular
 diamonds
 and
 then
 1,136


rose
 cut
 diamonds
 as
 well
 as
 56
 pretty


sizable
 emeralds.
 Okay,
 so
 they
 dropped


this
 crown,
 but
 they
 did
 manage
 to
 get


eight
 items.
 Take
 me
 through
 what
 those


were.
 What
 were
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


gets?


So,
 um,
 you
 know,
 again,
 my
 crash
 course


on
 learning
 about
 royal
 jewelry,
 a
 lot


of
 these
 items
 stem
 from
 either
 Napoleon


III
 or
 Napoleon
 himself.
 So,
 I'll
 take


you
 through
 a
 couple.
 There
 was
 this


incredible
 emerald
 necklace
 and
 earring


set
 that
 Napoleon
 gave
 to
 his
 second


wife
 for
 their
 wedding
 in
 1810.


>> Wow.


>> So,
 that's
 just
 one.
 Then
 there's
 this


decorative
 bow
 that
 was
 worn
 by
 Empress


Eugenei
 that
 has
 two
 thou
 more
 than


2,000
 diamonds.


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 saw
 a
 picture
 of
 that
 one.


I
 was
 like
 hard
 to
 look
 at.
 It
 was
 so


shiny
 even
 just
 in
 the
 pictures,
 you


know.


And
 there's
 like
 a
 pearl
 um
 kind
 of
 tiar


that's
 also
 incredibly
 jaw-dropping.
 But


Natalie,
 one
 thing
 that
 points
 to
 that


these
 thieves


knew
 what
 they
 were
 doing
 is
 they
 didn't


go
 for
 what
 was
 really
 the
 most


expensive
 item.
 In
 those
 cases,
 they


went
 for
 these
 items.
 And
 there's
 a
 lots


of
 discussion
 about,
 you
 know,
 maybe


they
 thought
 these
 ones
 would
 be
 easier


to
 break
 down
 and
 easier
 to
 um
 smelled


and
 break
 apart
 and
 sell
 in
 small


pieces.
 But
 you
 know
 among
 those
 cases


is
 this
 incredible
 diamond
 that's
 known


as
 the
 regent


>> that
 was
 bought
 by
 the
 Duke
 of
 Orlon
 in


like
 the
 early
 1700s
 and
 was
 on
 the


centerpiece
 of
 Louis
 X
 the
 15th's
 crown


and
 then
 later
 was
 on
 Napoleon's
 sword


on
 Louis
 V
 16th's
 crown


>> and
 it's
 like
 the
 size
 of
 a
 plum.


>> Wow.
 But
 lots
 of
 jewelry
 experts
 say
 it


would
 be
 just
 far
 too
 easy
 to
 identify


and
 really
 hard
 to
 pawn
 off.


>> So
 we
 have
 a
 sense
 that
 this
 is
 more
 of


a
 commodity
 grab
 than
 an
 attempt
 to
 get


beautiful
 heritage
 pieces
 for
 some
 kind


of
 kooky
 specialist
 collector
 who
 wants


to
 hold
 things
 alone
 in
 a
 vault.
 Right?


>> And
 so
 if
 you're
 going
 for
 commodities,


you're
 looking
 for
 things
 that
 can
 be


quickly
 disassembled
 and
 sold
 in
 small


pieces.


>> Right?
 These
 are
 thieves.
 The
 idea
 is


who
 are
 looking
 to
 sell
 these
 things
 and


make
 money,
 not,
 you
 know,
 mount
 them
 in


their
 homes.
 I
 can
 imagine
 it's
 a
 lot


easier,
 right,
 to
 sell
 a
 single
 diamond


than
 a
 distinctive
 necklace,
 for


example.


>> Right.
 Well,
 you
 can't
 sell
 that


distinctive
 necklace
 because
 it's


already
 been
 traced.
 You
 know,
 like


Interpol
 has
 put
 it
 on
 its
 list.
 You


would
 get
 caught
 very,
 very
 quickly.
 But


the
 idea
 of
 what
 experts
 are
 telling
 us


is
 is
 that
 you
 would
 break
 it
 down
 into


small
 pieces,
 maybe
 carve
 some
 of
 the


larger
 stones
 into
 smaller
 stones
 so


they're
 less
 identifiable.


>> You
 know,
 one
 expert
 says
 you
 string


them
 into
 a
 different
 kind
 of
 necklace


and
 sell
 it
 and
 pawn
 it
 off
 that
 way.


But
 certainly
 if
 you
 try
 and
 auction


anything
 off,
 people
 will
 be
 on
 the


alert
 looking
 for
 these
 things.
 Can
 I


ask,
 you
 know,
 everybody's
 been
 talking


about
 these
 crown
 jewels
 as
 priceless,


but
 obviously
 there
 is
 a
 price
 that
 you


can
 attach
 to
 these
 things,
 right?
 Do
 we


know
 what
 was
 the
 worth
 of
 the
 things


they
 stole?
 Yeah,
 we
 just
 found
 out.
 Up


until
 now,
 there's
 been
 lots
 of


speculation
 about
 how
 much
 they
 might


have
 escaped
 with,
 but
 the
 head
 of
 the


investigation
 just
 went
 on
 public
 radio


literally
 minutes
 ago
 and
 said
 that
 the


estimation
 they
 have
 is
 they
 are
 worth


88
 million.


>> WA,


>> which
 is
 a
 ton.
 But
 she
 also
 said
 this


interesting
 thing.
 She
 said,
 "Look,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 were
 to
 break
 them
 apart


and
 melt
 them
 down,
 they'd
 be
 worth
 a


lot
 less."
 in
 some
 ways
 almost


beseeching
 to
 the
 the
 thieves
 like


please
 don't
 do
 this
 you
 know
 you're
 not


going
 to
 make
 as
 much
 money
 as
 is as
 how


uh
 we
 read
 it
 in
 in
 the
 office


>> for
 what
 purpose
 do
 you
 think
 out
 of
 a


desire
 to
 keep
 these
 precious
 items


intact?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 even
 if
 they're
 worth
 88


million
 euros,
 I
 think
 to
 the
 country
 of


France
 and


the
 history
 of
 the
 country,
 they're


worth
 a
 ton
 more.


Historically,
 symbolically,
 culturally,


these
 things
 are
 priceless.


>> And
 so,
 I
 think
 in
 some
 ways,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 talking
 about,
 you


know,
 how
 much
 they'd
 be
 worth,
 but


really
 the
 loss
 is
 more
 emotional
 for


the
 country
 than
 I
 think
 it
 is


financial.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 just
 about
 the


reaction
 to
 some
 of
 this.
 If
 the


assumption
 is
 that
 these
 thieves
 are


going
 to
 break
 these
 things
 down,
 maybe


melt
 down
 the
 gold,
 sell
 it
 for
 parts,


make
 as
 much
 money
 as
 possible,
 how
 are


French
 people
 responding
 to
 that


possibility?
 It
 is
 the
 history
 of
 this


country
 that
 could
 be
 disappeared.


I
 think
 the
 predominant
 reaction
 has


been
 shock
 and
 not
 that
 at
 the
 idea
 of


these
 things
 being
 melted
 down
 per
 se,


but
 just
 at
 the
 whole
 like
 what
 happened


on
 Sunday
 morning.
 The
 fact
 that
 these


people
 could
 that
 easily
 get
 into
 the


Louv
 has
 caused,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


different
 kinds
 of
 emotional
 reactions.


There's
 been
 anger.
 People
 are
 stunned.


Some
 people
 are
 quite
 emotional
 about


it.
 the
 country's
 justice
 minister.
 He


said
 that
 this
 is
 certain
 sign
 of
 a


failure.
 We
 have
 failed.
 It
 has
 been


politicized.
 There's
 been
 people


particularly
 on
 the
 right
 wing
 of
 the


spectrum
 blaming
 the
 government
 for
 not


putting
 enough
 money
 into
 security.


There's
 been
 questions
 about
 what
 is
 the


the
 security
 of
 the
 lou.
 And
 there's


just
 been
 sort
 of
 people
 bemoning
 the


fact
 that
 this
 could
 happen
 in
 the


center
 of
 the
 city
 in
 the
 the
 most


famous,
 most
 visited,
 most
 coveted,
 most


protected
 museum
 in
 France
 and
 likely


the
 world.


>> Right.
 The
 reaction
 that
 you're


describing
 sounds
 like
 it's
 one
 of
 a


sense
 of
 self
 questioning
 that's


happening
 because
 of
 just
 how
 highly


traffic
 this
 area
 was.
 How
 could
 this


possibly
 occur?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 There's


that
 sense
 and
 also
 just
 the
 sense
 of


tragedy.
 This
 country
 watched
 the
 NRAAM


almost
 burn
 down
 and
 people
 lined
 the


banks
 of
 the
 Sen
 with
 tears
 in
 their


eyes.
 You
 know,
 many
 of
 them
 kneeling


watching
 it.
 I
 think
 French
 people


living
 here,
 they
 are


very
 critical
 culturally.
 They're
 people


who
 like
 to
 strike.
 They
 like
 to


complain.
 They're
 pretty
 critical,


>> but
 they
 love
 their
 history.
 If
 you
 go


into
 a
 French
 bookstore,
 like
 one
 out
 of


every
 four
 books
 is
 a
 history
 book.


People
 know
 their
 history.
 They
 visit


the
 museums.
 This
 is
 like
 a
 a
 very


important
 cultural
 place
 in
 in
 French


people's
 hearts.
 And


>> I
 think
 people
 are
 appalled,
 shocked,


and
 really
 grieving
 to
 a
 degree.
 The


thing
 that's
 really
 interesting
 is
 that,


you
 know,
 France
 doesn't
 actually
 have
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 royal


jewels
 like
 this
 because
 of
 the


revolution.


>> Explain
 that.


>> And
 so,
 you
 know,
 the
 revolution
 which


ended
 in
 the
 beheading
 of
 the
 king
 and


queen
 at
 the
 time.
 At
 that
 time,
 the
 the


Louv
 was
 sacked.
 A
 lot
 of
 things
 were


stolen,
 including
 some
 of
 the
 jewels.


But
 then,
 you
 know,
 France
 has
 a
 really


ambivalent
 relationship
 with
 its
 royal


history.
 It's
 a
 very
 proud
 republic.
 And


during
 one
 of
 those
 republics,
 they


decided
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 take


what
 was
 left
 of
 the
 royal
 jewels
 and


auction
 them
 off.
 And
 that's
 what
 they


did
 in
 the
 late
 1800s.
 They
 auctioned


off
 tons
 of
 these
 jewels.
 And


incredibly,
 the
 lion
 share
 of
 them
 were


bought
 by
 an
 American
 who
 was
 a
 founder


of
 Tiffany's.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 So,
 um,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 Lou


has
 been
 spending
 decades
 now
 trying
 to


get
 them
 back.


>> In
 reading
 about
 this
 story,
 I
 learned


that
 this
 is
 one
 of
 several
 thefts
 from


French
 museums
 this
 year.
 Can
 you
 tell


me
 about
 some
 of
 those
 other
 episodes?


Like,
 what
 is
 going
 on?


>> Yeah,
 even
 this
 week
 there
 was
 a
 small


museum
 that
 was
 burgled
 twice
 in
 a
 row


and
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 like,
 should
 we


do
 a
 story
 on
 this?
 So,
 it
 was
 funny


that
 when
 this
 happened,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh


my
 god."
 But
 yeah,
 last
 month
 someone


went
 into
 the
 natural
 history
 museum,


which
 is
 only
 a
 couple
 subway
 stops
 away


from
 the
 Louv,
 and
 using
 kind
 of
 similar


tools,
 cut
 into
 some
 cases
 and
 took
 out


a
 bunch
 of
 molten
 raw
 gold
 and
 made
 off


with
 them.
 In
 the
 same
 month,
 last


month,
 a
 museum
 down
 in
 Limoge,


southwest
 of
 Paris,
 thieves
 broke
 into
 a


museum
 and
 stole
 some
 ancient
 China.
 In


November
 of
 last
 year,
 thieves
 using


bats
 went
 in
 during
 the
 day
 also
 to
 a


quite
 famous
 museum
 not
 far
 away
 from


where
 I'm
 sitting.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 there's
 definitely
 a


streak
 of
 these
 right
 now,
 right,


>> in
 France.
 Is
 there
 an
 understanding


that
 these
 robberies
 are
 connected
 in


any
 way?
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 just
 wondering,
 it


does
 feel
 like
 it's
 out
 of
 another
 era


that
 you
 have
 this
 string
 of
 museum


robberies,
 you
 know,
 and
 I'm
 wondering


if
 the
 thieves
 either
 are
 in
 any
 way


working
 together,
 even
 loosely,
 or
 are


targeting
 the
 museums
 for
 similar


reasons.


>> There's
 no
 indication
 that
 people
 are


working
 together.
 Yes,
 this
 seems
 very


old-fashioned,
 except
 for
 in
 one
 way.


This
 happened
 in
 broad
 daylight,
 you


know,
 when
 people
 were
 in
 the
 museum,


right?


>> And
 that's
 pretty
 new.
 There's
 a
 modern


art
 museum
 here
 that
 was
 famously


burgled
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 and
 a


man
 made
 off
 with
 five
 very
 famous


tableau.
 And
 he
 did
 it
 in
 a
 classic
 way


like
 when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the


movie
 in
 your
 head,
 which
 here
 is
 known


as
 Lup.
 It's
 a
 very
 famous
 series.
 If


you
 haven't
 seen
 it,
 definitely
 watch


it.


>> I've
 seen
 it.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm


watching
 it
 in
 real
 life
 right
 now.
 But,


you
 know,
 like
 it's
 it's
 secret.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 often
 that's
 at
 night
 or
 in
 some
 way


that
 people
 don't
 see
 it
 happening.
 This


is
 like
 a
 very
 brazen
 in
 that
 we
 do
 know


that,
 you
 know,
 there's
 CCTV
 cameras
 all


around
 the
 Louv.
 There
 were
 people
 there


even.
 So,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 different.


And
 the
 lead
 investigator
 is
 talking


about
 this
 being
 like
 incredibly


organized.
 She
 doesn't
 think
 there
 was


just
 four
 people.
 She
 thinks
 that


there's
 many
 more
 involved
 in
 this.
 So,


we
 don't
 know
 anything
 about
 these
 four


guys
 who
 broke
 into
 the
 Lou,
 though.
 So,


you
 know,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 um
 what
 kind


of
 connections,
 but
 clearly
 they're


either
 copycatting
 or
 there's
 some
 ring


that's
 sponsoring
 them.
 Those
 are


questions
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 hope
 to
 be


able
 to
 answer
 in
 the
 weeks
 to
 come.


>> What
 are
 the
 next
 steps
 in
 the


investigation?
 Like,
 what
 are
 the


investigators
 telling
 you
 about
 the


manhunt
 for
 these
 guys,
 about
 their


investigative
 strategies?
 Do
 we
 know
 how


they're
 going
 about
 trying
 to
 catch


them?


>> No.
 What
 we
 do
 know
 is
 that
 there
 were


60
 police
 investigators
 on
 the
 case.


Now,
 we
 know
 it's
 up
 to
 100.
 We
 know


that
 they've
 been
 using
 DNA
 methods,


fingerprinting.
 They've
 been
 using


surveillance
 cameras.
 We
 know
 that
 the


truck
 was
 left
 behind.


>> Yeah.
 They
 didn't
 manage
 to
 burn
 it.


>> They
 didn't
 manage
 to
 burn
 it.
 We
 know


that
 they
 had
 just
 recently
 basically


stolen
 it.
 And
 so
 investigators
 are


speaking
 to
 the
 person
 they
 stole
 it


from.
 But
 that's
 the
 gist
 of
 what
 we've


been
 told
 by
 investigators.
 They
 are


being
 incredibly
 tight-
 lipped
 about
 it


at
 this
 point.
 I
 think
 they
 will
 speak


more
 once
 and
 if
 they
 find
 them.
 But


there's
 a
 real
 feeling
 that
 there's
 a


race
 against
 time
 to
 try
 and
 get
 them


before
 these
 precious
 jewels
 are
 broken


apart
 and
 secreted
 away.


My
 final
 question
 for
 you,
 Catherine,
 is


do
 you
 think
 it's
 possible?
 And
 it


sounds
 like
 it
 might
 be
 that
 these


thieves
 actually
 pulled
 this
 off,
 like


that
 they
 could
 get
 away
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 possible
 that


we
 will
 never
 see
 those
 jewels
 again,


[Music]


but
 I
 think
 France
 has
 a
 pretty
 good


record
 of
 capturing
 some
 of
 these


people.
 In
 fact,
 the
 person
 who
 is
 said


to
 have
 broken
 into
 the
 Natural
 History


Museum
 was
 just
 charged
 today.
 She
 was


captured
 in
 Barcelona.
 I
 think
 given
 the


amount
 of
 cameras
 um
 and
 evidence
 that


the
 cops
 have
 that
 they
 will
 be
 able
 to


trace
 who
 these
 men
 were.


If
 someone
 tries
 to
 sell,
 you
 know,
 that


beautiful
 diamond
 bow
 that
 we
 were


talking
 about
 earlier,
 then
 no
 doubt


they'll
 get
 caught
 and
 it
 will
 be


returned.
 And
 that
 is
 the
 best
 case


scenario.
 But
 if
 they
 take
 each
 of
 those


thousand
 plus
 diamonds
 off
 and
 make


something
 entirely
 different
 out
 of
 it,


maybe
 a
 tiara,
 I
 don't
 know,
 an
 anklet,


a
 bracelet
 for
 a
 very
 rich
 person,
 then


who
 would
 notice
 at
 first?
 You
 would


need
 to
 be
 an
 expert
 to
 be
 able
 to
 trace


those
 diamonds
 to
 that
 bow.
 So,
 it
 seems


much
 less
 likely


in
 this
 case
 that
 these
 beautiful
 pieces


of
 French
 heritage
 will
 make
 their
 way


back.


[Music]


Catherine,
 thanks
 so
 much.


>> You're
 welcome,
 Natalie.
 It
 was
 such
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 talking
 to
 you.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


>> Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.
 Today


>> we
 are
 one
 week
 into
 President
 Trump's


historic
 peace
 plan
 in
 the
 Middle
 East


and
 things
 are
 going
 frankly
 better
 than


I
 expected
 that
 they
 were.
 On
 Tuesday,


Vice
 President
 JD
 Vance
 traveled
 to


Israel
 as
 the
 US
 seeks
 to
 shore
 up
 the


fragile
 ceasefire
 deal
 in
 Gaza,
 which


has
 come
 under
 strain
 with
 repeated


flare-ups
 of
 violence
 in
 recent
 days.


Vance
 didn't
 give
 a
 deadline
 for
 Hamas


to
 disarm,
 a
 key
 part
 of
 that
 truce


agreement,
 and
 he
 also
 didn't
 specify


how
 officials
 would
 make
 sure
 the
 group


agrees
 to
 do
 so.


>> We've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 left
 to
 do.
 This


is
 going
 to
 take
 a
 very,
 very
 long
 time.


>> The
 vice
 president
 did
 express
 optimism


that
 the
 deal
 would
 hold,
 but
 said
 the


process
 of
 securing
 long-term
 peace


would
 take
 time.


And
 a
 White
 House
 official
 said
 on


Tuesday
 that
 Trump
 had
 no
 plans
 to
 meet


with
 Russian
 President
 Vladimir
 Putin
 in


the
 immediate
 future.
 A
 pivot
 after


Trump
 had
 suggested
 last
 week
 that
 he


would
 meet
 with
 the
 Russian
 leader
 soon


to
 discuss
 an
 end
 to
 the
 war
 in
 Ukraine.


Speaking
 to
 reporters,
 Trump
 said
 he


wanted
 to
 avoid
 a
 quote
 wasted
 meeting


with
 Putin.


White
 House
 press
 secretary
 Caroline


Levit
 said
 that
 after
 Trump
 had
 a
 call


with
 Putin
 last
 week,
 the
 Russian
 leader


had
 committed
 to
 sitting
 down
 with
 him.
