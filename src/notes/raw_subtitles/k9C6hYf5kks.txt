responsible

 report
 we
 look


forward
 to
 presenting
 some


highlights
 the
 work
 we
 do
 on
 responsible


investment
 is
 crucial
 for
 the
 long
 term


value
 of
 the
 fund
 And
 That's
 why
 we
 here


today
 The
 report
 shows
 the

 of
 our

 Wow
 we
 have
 been


busy
 but
 when
 we
 zoom
 in
 three
 themes


appear
 long
 term
 climate
 and


transparency
 and
 let's
 start
 with
 long


term
 Because
 that's
 our
 responsible


investment
 work
 is
 all


about
 creating
 long
 term
 value
 for


Future


Generations
 We
 are
 an
 investor
 in
 almost


9000
 companies
 Across
 70
 markets
 and
 our


Returns

 from
 the

 Frequency

 and
 key
 points
 are


simple
 qu
 reporting
 and
 the
 pressure
 on


management
 to
 reach
 earnings
 guidance


can
 lead
 to
 short
 term
 decisions
 it
 May


hinder
 growth
 and
 innovation
 and
 it
 May


also
 deter
 companies
 from
 accessing


public


markets
 This
 is
 not
 about
 frequent


Disclosure

 Remains
 a
 Priority
 to


us
 We
 Believe
 the
 current
 system
 is
 not


good
 enough
 at
 aligning
 the
 interest
 of


ceos
 with
 us
 as


shareholders
 and
 last

 Paid

 that
 pay
 out
 gradually
 over
 10


years
 incentivizing
 him
 to
 think
 and
 Act


long
 term
 and
 this
 is
 the
 kind
 of


approach
 We
 want
 to
 see


the
 long
 Perspective
 is
 also
 crucial
 in


other
 areas
 not
 the
 least
 the
 climate


transition
 and

World
 growth
 And
 That's
 why
 we
 are


working
 for
 the
 transition
 of
 our


investment
 portfolio
 That's
 in
 our


economic
 interest
 and
 it's
 what
 our


climate
 plan
 is
 all
 about
 and
 as
 we


coming
 into
 the
 last
 year
 of
 the
 climate


plan
 2024
 Was
 all
 about
 making
 sure
 we


progress
 on
 the
 really
 ambitious
 targets


we
 set
 back
 in
 2022


Is
 it
 working
 Well
 data

 Show

 and
 increasing

 Risk
 We


are
 seeing
 a
 need
 for
 a
 faster


transition
 and
 more
 government
 action


It's
 Complex
 It's
 challenging
 but
 we


also
 seeing
 the
 transition
 happening
 we


seeing
 record
 renewables
 investments
 we


seeing
 more
 targets
 from
 companies
 and


we
 seeing
 emissions
 falling
 and
 this


Matters
 to
 us
 because
 our
 data
 also


shows
 that
 if
 you
 have
 good
 climate


targets
 you
 actually
 reduce
 your


emissions
 those
 without
 targets
 reduce


less
 than
 those
 with
 74%
 of
 our


emissions
 in
 the
 portfolio
 are
 now


covered
 by
 scope

 and

 And
 that's

 this

shows
 sort
 of
 growth
 from
 over
 last


years
 you
 know
 as
 you
 can
 see
 the


numbers
 are
 coming
 up
 the
 topics
 are


getting
 more
 Concrete
 And
 it
 really


points
 to
 it
 now
 being
 a
 very
 central


part
 of
 our
 company
 dialogue
 and
 we
 like


to
 see
 this
 because
 they
 say
 that
 the


proof
 of
 the
 Pudding
 is
 in
 the
 eating


and
 we
 said
 in
 our
 climate
 plan
 that
 the


largest

should
 reduce
 emissions

 Will

 and
 this


focus
 on
 Concrete
 short
 Ter
 action
 is


good
 but
 we
 would
 also
 like
 to
 remind


companies
 that
 we
 need
 a
 longterm
 Focus


to
 because
 this
 is
 not

 for

 This
 is

 for

 actually

 in

 Because
 we
 see
 that

negatively
 today
 When
 companies
 fail
 to


deliver
 on
 their

 Commitments
 as


you
