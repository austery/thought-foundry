I
 kind
 of
 landed
 into
 technology
 and


startups
 just
 by
 seeing
 that
 emergency


happen
 in
 my
 community
 as
 a
 kid.


>> A
 second
 student
 has
 died
 from
 Monday's


school
 shooting
 in
 Chardan,
 Ohio.
 All


schools
 in
 Chardan
 are
 closed
 today.
 The


seven


>> it
 was
 an
 active
 shooter
 event
 when
 I


was
 12.
 I
 was
 in
 third
 grade,
 I
 think.


And
 yeah,
 someone
 came
 on
 site
 and


brought
 a
 weapon,
 shot
 students,
 and
 I


think
 there
 were
 four
 people
 that
 passed


away.
 my
 town
 borders
 the
 town
 where
 the


emergency
 happened.
 My
 school
 walked


down
 cuz
 it
 was
 so
 close.
 And
 as
 a
 young


kid,
 right,
 I
 was
 12
 when
 this
 happened.


And
 so
 like
 you
 just
 recognize
 like,


hey,
 safety
 is
 something
 that's
 not
 a


given.


[Music]


I'm
 Michael
 Chime.
 I'm
 one
 of
 the


co-founders
 and
 the
 CEO.
 Prepared
 is
 an


AI
 assistant
 for
 911
 calls
 that
 helps


them
 process
 the
 calls
 better,
 faster,


with
 higher
 quality.
 We
 are
 in
 all
 but


one
 state
 I
 think
 so
 49
 states
 we
 cover


about
 100
 million
 in
 population


technology
 all
 around
 us
 is
 moving


really
 rapidly
 but
 it's
 not
 in
 public


safety
 somebody
 calling
 911
 and
 having
 a


really
 bad
 experience
 that's
 happening


everywhere
 uh
 was
 an
 undergrad
 at
 Yale


of
 all
 things
 so
 people
 are
 like
 why
 are


you
 building
 in
 public
 safety
 that's
 a


unique
 life
 choice
 I
 actually
 don't
 know


if
 I'll
 be
 successful
 but
 I
 think
 I'll


regret
 not
 having
 tried


so
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 small
 town
 outside
 of


Cleveland.
 I
 think
 I
 wanted
 to
 play


sports
 after
 college.
 I
 was
 always


naturally
 drawn
 towards
 things
 that
 were


challenging
 to
 do
 and
 felt
 important
 and


so
 sports
 was
 the
 best
 way
 for
 me
 to
 to


do
 that.
 Um
 I
 probably
 would
 have
 played


sports
 or
 just
 taken
 a
 fang
 job
 after


school.
 That's
 probably
 what
 I
 would


have
 done.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 pre
 that


event
 I
 ever
 really
 thought
 about
 safety


or
 the
 idea
 that
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 safe.
 And


you
 know,
 like
 as
 a
 kid
 you're
 like,
 "Oh


my
 goodness,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 drill."
 And


the
 teachers
 are
 actually
 nervous.
 um
 be


it
 comes
 real
 quickly
 that
 you
 know


you're
 not
 always
 safe.
 Seeing
 that


happen
 in
 a
 place
 where
 you
 actually


knew
 the
 people,
 I
 think
 it
 really
 hit


home.
 Emergencies
 could
 happen
 and
 they


could
 impact
 people
 you
 actually
 know
 or


you
 that
 was,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 back
 of


my
 head.
 It
 was
 a
 thought
 that
 I
 had
 all


throughout
 my
 childhood.
 And
 then
 then


when
 I
 went
 to
 high
 school
 and
 was


thinking
 about
 these
 things
 more,


Marshall
 lives
 at
 its
 at
 its
 peak.
 And


so
 our
 generation
 was
 really
 starting
 to


take
 a
 stand
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 this
 is
 not


so
 great.
 We
 should
 change
 things
 here."


And
 that
 was
 compelling
 and
 exciting
 to


me.
 When
 I
 went
 to
 college,
 I
 met
 two


classmates
 that
 turned
 out
 to
 be


co-founders
 later,
 Dylan
 and
 Neil.
 Grew


up
 in
 a
 very
 similar
 environment.
 They


the
 town
 over
 from
 them
 was
 Sandy
 Hook.


And
 so
 I
 think
 just
 generally
 speaking,


we
 thought
 about
 it
 more
 as
 kids.
 And
 we


didn't
 think
 we
 would
 build
 a
 company.


We
 just
 thought
 we
 would
 build
 this


simple
 tool
 schools
 would
 use
 in
 college


and
 then
 we
 would
 go
 off
 and
 do
 whatever


our
 jobs
 etc.
 after.


Yeah.
 So
 our
 first
 product
 was
 an
 app


for
 schools
 and
 we
 had
 a
 couple
 hundred


schools
 across
 the
 country
 launch
 that


solution
 and
 that's
 how
 we
 got
 into
 911


was
 schools
 would
 say
 they
 were
 running


a
 drill,
 right?
 They
 would
 take
 a


picture
 of
 something
 on
 site
 and
 then


they'd
 want
 to
 share
 it
 to
 911,
 right?


Because
 911
 would
 respond
 to
 that


situation.
 In
 doing
 that
 work,
 we'd
 want


to
 share
 data
 to
 911
 centers.
 But
 what
 I


realized
 is
 that
 that
 simple
 idea,


sharing
 a
 picture
 to
 somebody
 in


emergency,
 that
 the
 current
 911
 systems


weren't
 set
 up
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 don't
 think


many
 people
 know
 this,
 but
 still
 today,


most
 of
 the
 911
 centers
 are
 using


technology
 built
 on
 the
 assumption
 those


calls
 are
 landl.
 So
 the
 first
 problem
 we


attempted
 to
 solve
 was
 that
 how
 do
 we


make
 sure
 that
 when
 we
 call
 the
 systems


are
 intelligent
 enough
 to
 take
 that


information
 in?
 I
 think
 we
 can
 hold
 the


line
 and
 say,
 okay,
 when
 somebody
 has


that
 situation,
 how
 do
 we
 hold
 a
 really


high
 bar
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 use


whatever
 technology
 possible
 to
 try
 to


make
 that
 the
 best
 possible
 response?


what
 was
 going
 to
 be
 senior
 class
 at


Yale
 was
 like
 taking
 the
 year
 off


school.
 So
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 guess
 I'll


do
 that,
 too."
 And
 I
 took
 the
 year
 off.


That's
 when
 I
 applied
 and
 did
 the
 teal


fellowship.
 The
 pitch
 to
 my
 parents
 who


did
 not
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 me
 doing
 the


fellowship
 at
 all.
 My
 mom
 actually
 hated


it.
 So
 both
 parents
 are
 like,
 "Michael,


you're
 one
 year
 away
 from
 graduating.


Why
 not
 just
 finish
 up?
 Like
 why
 not


just
 go
 all
 the
 way
 through?"
 And
 this


was
 it
 was
 nonobvious
 that
 we
 were
 going


to
 have
 any
 success.
 It
 was
 like
 our


first
 office
 was
 an
 apartment
 and
 the


master
 was
 the
 office
 and
 it
 was
 just


folding
 tables
 with
 monitors.
 And
 so
 I


was
 like,
 "Mom
 and
 dad,
 I'm
 going to
 go


and
 live
 here
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 work
 on


this
 thing."
 So
 it
 was
 a
 hard
 pitch.
 I


said
 to
 them
 what
 I
 said
 here,
 which
 I


really
 believe
 is
 just
 like,
 you
 know,


mom,
 dad,
 like
 the
 problem
 that
 we're


talking
 about
 here,
 somebody
 calling
 911


and
 having
 a
 really
 bad
 experience


that's
 happening
 everywhere.
 I
 actually


don't
 know if
 I'll
 be
 successful,
 but
 I


think
 I'll
 regret
 not
 having
 tried,


right?
 And
 they
 let
 me
 do
 it.
 And
 so


this
 is
 when
 I
 just
 started
 knocking
 on


the
 door
 of
 911
 centers
 and
 then
 they,


you
 know,
 walked
 me
 through
 the
 center.


I
 remember
 that
 moment
 walking
 through
 a


911
 center
 for
 the
 first
 time
 really


vividly.
 It
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 again,


I
 had
 come
 in
 with
 this
 assumption
 that


I
 was
 about
 to
 walk
 in
 and
 see
 the


coolest
 technology
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 I
 was


about
 to
 see
 the
 best
 technology
 in
 the


world.
 And
 I
 saw
 the
 complete
 inverse.
 I


remember
 the
 first
 time
 I
 sat
 next
 to
 a


call
 taker
 and
 they
 were
 doing
 their


best
 work,
 but
 the
 guy,
 you
 know,
 like


he's
 taking
 a
 call.
 Someone
 was
 very


urgent.
 He
 kind
 of
 had
 like
 the
 headset


on
 his
 ear.
 He's
 typing
 as
 fast
 as
 he


can
 every
 single
 detail
 that
 this


person's
 trying
 to
 describe.
 like


clearly
 missing
 stuff
 and
 anybody
 would


I
 would
 miss
 stuff
 if
 I
 was
 in
 that
 same


seat
 but
 the
 that
 dash
 stream
 of


consciousness
 of
 notes
 is
 what
 someone


was
 going
 to
 run
 into
 a
 burning
 building


with
 and
 my
 mind
 was
 blown
 it's
 very


daunting
 to
 rip
 out
 their
 current


technology
 if
 you
 rip
 out
 center
 and
 you


miss
 one
 single
 call
 that's
 like
 a


really
 big
 deal
 and
 so
 what
 we
 had
 to
 do


was
 architect
 okay
 how
 do
 we
 fit
 within


the
 systems
 we
 sit
 there
 and
 we
 say
 hey


like
 I
 can
 appreciate
 why
 the
 technology


is
 that
 way
 it's
 very
 hard
 it's


difficult
 to
 switch
 systems
 how
 do
 we


actually
 build
 our
 solution


around
 your
 concerns
 which
 are
 valid,


right?
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 vendor's


done
 that
 or
 any
 technology
 company
 has


done
 that
 before.
 They've
 just,
 you


know,
 said,
 "Well,
 why
 is
 that
 so
 bad?


Let's
 just
 rip
 it
 out."
 And
 I
 think
 that


you
 need
 something
 more
 thoughtful
 than


that
 to
 to
 see
 real
 change.
 We
 should


solve
 it
 today.
 We
 shouldn't
 wait
 10


years
 to
 go
 and
 solve
 that
 problem.
 So,


we
 thought
 the
 best,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


most
 speedy
 way
 to
 start
 making
 progress


was
 integrating
 with
 the
 systems
 as


opposed
 to
 ripping
 them
 out.
 the
 next


generation
 of
 911.
 The
 Orlando
 Fire


Department
 is
 upgrading
 its
 dispatch


center
 with
 new
 software
 that
 allows


callers
 to
 live
 stream
 videos
 and


pictures.


>> I
 remember
 when
 we
 first
 turned
 on
 our


product
 for
 911
 centers.
 Within
 our


first
 week,
 people
 used
 it
 to
 save
 a


life.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 CPR
 call.
 So,


someone
 calls
 in,
 they're
 with
 their


friend
 and
 they,
 you
 know,
 pass
 somebody


on
 the
 street
 that
 was
 passed
 out
 and


they
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 we're
 going to


initiate.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 CPR."
 But


they
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 do
 CPR.
 They
 had


never
 done
 it
 before.
 and
 the
 call
 taker


was
 trying
 to
 walk
 them
 through
 it
 over


the
 phone
 but
 couldn't
 understand
 where


their
 hands
 were
 placed
 if
 they
 were


breathing
 at
 the
 right
 time
 and
 they


remembered
 oh
 I
 have
 prepared
 and
 they


turned
 on
 live
 stream
 and
 so
 the
 friends


started
 streaming
 CPR
 with
 the
 phone
 on


speaker
 and
 the
 call
 taker
 saw
 it
 and


was
 able
 to
 coach
 them
 through
 live
 and


the
 guy
 comes
 back
 to
 to
 life
 and
 so


that
 was
 in
 our
 first
 week
 of
 deploying


the
 technology
 and
 you're
 like
 okay


that's
 pretty
 cool
 so
 I
 think
 early
 on


that
 was
 a
 real
 driver
 and
 motivator
 and


now
 I
 mean
 we
 are
 on
 track
 this
 year
 to


process
 well
 over
 30
 million
 calls
 every


day.
 You
 just
 get
 stories
 of
 how
 people


are
 using
 it
 to
 save
 lives.


One
 way
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 internalize


the
 weight
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 spend


time
 with
 the
 centers.
 You
 go
 into
 a


center
 and
 you
 see
 somebody
 take
 a
 call


and
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 feel
 the
 weight


and
 the
 pain
 of
 not
 being
 able
 to
 handle


that
 call
 cuz
 they're
 sitting
 on


language
 line
 or
 they
 miss
 a
 key
 detail.


And
 so
 like
 the
 impacts
 of
 those
 things


are
 life-changing.
 Every
 new
 product


that
 you've
 seen
 us
 launch
 has
 been


sitting
 next
 to
 a
 center
 who's
 actually


using
 it
 and
 we
 just
 watch
 them
 have
 a


problem
 and
 then
 we
 go
 and
 and
 solve
 it.


In
 our
 first
 month
 where
 we
 launched
 the


very
 first
 version
 of
 our
 product
 which


was
 again
 you
 could
 send
 a
 link
 to
 a


citizen
 and
 they
 could
 live
 stream
 and


share
 pictures,
 videos
 etc.
 Our
 first


month
 we
 had
 like
 350
 incidents
 go


through
 the
 platform.
 Shortly


thereafter,
 3
 months
 later
 we
 had
 60,000


monthly
 messages
 going
 through
 the


platform.
 saw
 a
 huge
 uptick
 in


emergencies.
 And
 so
 you
 had
 this
 large


amount
 of
 data
 that
 you
 can
 go
 in
 and


talk
 to
 customers,
 hey,
 why
 are
 you


using
 it
 this
 way?
 One
 of the
 things


that
 became
 clear
 was
 if
 you
 had
 bad


information
 go
 into
 911,
 that
 was


actually
 worse
 than
 no
 information
 at


all.
 Language
 translation
 is
 an
 example.


Initially,
 we
 would
 see
 people
 text
 back


that
 link
 in
 Spanish.
 And
 we
 literally


have
 centers
 go
 into
 our
 platform,
 get


that
 text
 in
 Spanish,
 copy
 and
 paste
 it


into
 Google
 Translate,
 translate
 it,
 and


then
 go
 back
 to
 us.
 like
 they
 were


toggling
 between
 these
 two
 screens
 and


we're
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 goodness,
 like
 we'll


just
 bring
 that
 in."
 And
 so
 our
 first


paid
 product
 was
 this
 just
 language


translation
 over
 text
 and
 centers
 used


it.
 You
 know,
 the
 next
 evolution
 of
 our


product
 was
 oh
 wait,
 why
 even
 text
 them


at
 all
 if
 they
 don't
 speak
 English?
 Why


can't
 we
 just,
 you
 know,
 translate
 it


right
 on
 the
 call?
 And
 so
 our
 next


product
 was
 could
 we
 plug
 in,
 pull
 out


the
 audio
 and
 start
 translating
 on
 the


audio
 as
 opposed
 to
 moving
 them
 to
 text?


And
 then
 yeah,
 we
 launched
 that
 product


and
 centers
 across
 the
 country
 started


using
 that
 transcription
 and


translation.
 And
 then
 now
 this
 last
 year


we
 started
 launching
 new
 versions
 of
 our


or
 new
 modules
 on
 top
 of
 our
 product


because
 we
 saw
 new
 problems.
 We
 started


processing
 millions
 of
 calls
 a
 month.


And
 you
 just
 look
 at
 those
 calls
 and
 you


see,
 oh
 my
 goodness,
 one,
 we
 have
 hold


times
 on
 non-emergency
 calls.
 And
 two,


when
 emergency
 calls
 come
 in,
 I'm


rushing
 between,
 you
 know,
 call
 to
 call.


Why
 do
 we
 have
 the
 critical
 resource,
 a


human
 agent
 focused
 on
 noise
 complaints


or
 parking
 tickets?
 AI
 could
 do
 that


job.
 And
 so
 we
 launched
 a
 voice
 agent


that
 could
 handle
 non-emergency
 calls.


And
 now
 some
 of
 the
 biggest
 cities
 in


the
 country
 are
 fully
 offloading
 those


calls
 to
 us.
 But
 we've
 just
 kind
 of


consistently
 looked
 at
 the
 usage
 in
 our


system
 and
 then
 gone
 and
 solved
 problems


now.
 And
 so
 we've
 just
 really
 gotten


focused
 on
 how
 are
 they
 using
 the
 system


and
 then
 what
 new
 problems
 are
 coming
 up


that
 they're
 trying
 to
 use
 the
 system
 to


solve
 and
 then
 how
 we
 just
 actually


solve
 those
 with
 what
 I've
 learned
 is


that
 like
 often
 the
 centers
 are
 telling


you
 exactly
 what
 you
 should
 build
 and


the
 problems
 that
 they
 have.
 And
 if
 you


just
 stay
 really
 tight
 to
 them
 and
 build


those
 things
 quickly,
 you'll
 probably


have
 a
 lot
 of
 success.
 Now
 I
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time
 in
 centers
 just
 sitting
 next
 to


them.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 even
 even
 as


we've
 gotten
 big
 I've
 tried
 to
 spend
 a


week
 or
 two
 weeks
 a
 month
 in
 centers


sitting
 next
 to
 them
 and
 it's
 just
 been


like
 such
 an
 advantage
 for
 us
 is
 that


like
 okay
 how
 are
 they
 actually
 using
 it


and
 you'd
 be
 surprised
 how
 many
 founders


or
 companies
 don't
 do
 that
 just
 don't


sit
 next
 to
 the
 centers
 and
 say
 how
 are


they
 actually
 using
 it
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the


decisions
 get
 made
 in
 rooms
 like
 this


totally
 away
 from
 anybody
 that's


actually
 using
 the
 technology
 and
 so


it's
 something
 that
 we've
 tried
 to
 stick


to
 as
 we've
 we've
 gotten
 bigger


I
 remember
 when
 we
 were
 first
 starting


and
 we
 were
 pitching
 investors,
 they


would
 tell
 me,
 "Don't
 work
 in


government.
 Don't
 work
 in
 911."
 One,


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 do,
 very
 hard
 to
 see


change,
 which
 is
 certainly
 true.
 But


also,
 there's
 not
 much
 money
 in
 911.


It's
 not
 a
 big
 enough
 market.
 And
 I


remember
 that
 advice
 of
 like,
 you
 know,


starting
 small
 and
 focusing
 on
 something


niche
 was
 actually
 a
 good
 thing.
 And
 so


I
 stuck
 to
 that
 and
 it
 worked
 out.
 One


of
 the
 things
 that
 had
 blocked
 invasion


was
 this
 long,
 arduous
 process
 to
 even


get
 in
 working
 with
 the
 center.
 There


were
 startups
 that
 in
 other
 markets
 that


had
 faced
 similar
 two
 decades
 ago


selling
 to
 the
 Fortune
 500
 companies
 for


a
 startup
 was
 very
 difficult.
 Normally


that
 was
 just
 like
 Oracle
 or
 Salesforce


or
 any
 other
 big
 company
 was
 able
 to


actually
 punch
 at
 that
 weight
 and
 the


reason
 was
 you
 had
 these
 large
 systems


IT
 units
 in
 public
 companies.
 They
 would


block
 everything.
 They
 would
 say
 like
 no


you
 can't
 work
 with
 the
 startup.
 We're


going to
 work
 with
 the
 big
 guy.
 And
 then


naturally
 the
 big
 companies
 didn't
 face


any
 pressure.
 So
 the
 technology
 got


really
 decayed.
 And
 so
 you
 had
 fortune


500
 companies
 with
 really
 antiquated


tools.
 So
 startups
 started
 to
 change


their
 model.
 So
 companies
 like
 a
 Slack


or
 a
 Yammer
 started
 to
 give
 their


product
 to
 end
 employees.
 And
 at
 the


time
 that
 was
 very
 controversial.


They're
 like
 wait
 you
 can't
 just
 give


your
 technology
 to
 the
 end
 employees.


You
 got
 to
 go
 through
 it
 first.
 You
 got


to
 do
 all
 these
 things.
 And
 they
 did
 it


and
 it
 worked.
 And
 bottoms
 up
 was
 born.


This
 idea
 of
 starting
 with
 the
 end


employees
 then
 going
 back
 to
 the
 kind
 of


processes
 of
 the
 big
 company.
 But
 at


least
 now
 you
 have
 the
 users
 at
 your


back.
 You've
 already
 shown
 them
 they


have
 something
 better.
 And
 the
 reason


that
 was
 really
 innovative
 was
 now
 the


large
 companies
 could
 no
 longer
 just


defend
 on
 process.
 They
 had
 to
 actually


defend
 on
 technology
 because
 you
 were


getting
 in,
 right?
 Our
 idea
 was
 that


government
 was
 the
 same
 thing
 or
 that


procurement
 was
 the
 systems
 IT


equivalent
 in
 in
 government
 and
 that
 if


we
 could
 get
 our
 technology
 in
 the
 hands


of
 end
 users
 and
 make
 the
 discussion


about
 technology
 and
 not
 procurement


that
 uh
 we
 would
 win.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 a


big
 part
 of
 our
 initial
 strategy.
 So
 our


first
 product
 was
 no
 cost
 for
 centers


and
 the
 only
 goal
 was
 to
 get
 our


technology
 in
 build
 the
 best
 solutions


show
 them
 that
 there
 was
 a
 better
 way


and
 then
 we
 thought
 that
 if
 we
 did
 do


that
 we'd
 be
 able
 to
 expand
 from
 there


and
 so
 our
 first
 roughly
 thousand
 cities


and
 we
 have
 over
 thousand
 cities
 now


across
 the
 country
 that
 use
 us
 paid
 us


nothing
 but
 they
 saw
 like
 oh
 my
 goodness


there
 is
 a
 better
 way
 and
 that
 was
 a
 big


part
 of
 our
 initial
 strategy.


Startups
 should
 really
 think
 first


principally
 about
 what
 is
 the
 reason
 the


thing
 that
 they
 think
 should
 happen
 has


not
 happened.
 Every
 good
 company
 starts


with
 a
 vision
 of
 a
 better
 future
 right


and
 to
 you
 it's
 clear
 that
 that
 future


should
 come
 to
 pass
 but
 it
 hasn't
 right.


So
 it's
 really
 you
 know
 sitting
 on
 the


question
 why
 it
 hasn't
 come
 to
 pass.
 So


in
 our
 space
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 that
 had
 actually
 built
 better


technology
 but
 nobody
 used
 it
 right
 the


real
 constraint
 for
 us
 was
 nobody
 had


hacked
 distribution.
 Most
 times
 the
 hard


problem
 with
 government
 is
 actually


getting
 in.
 And
 so
 again,
 like


counterintuitive
 idea
 because
 a
 business


should
 make
 money,
 but
 if
 my
 goal
 is
 to


get
 the
 technology
 side
 by
 side,
 what


should
 you
 do?
 Give
 it
 for
 free.
 Remove


all
 the
 barriers
 and
 all
 the
 friction


needed
 to
 get
 your
 technology
 next
 to


theirs.
 Sometimes
 it's
 not
 obvious.
 It's


not
 just
 build
 a
 better
 system.


I
 I
 think
 the
 hardest
 thing
 is


especially
 at
 the
 rate
 that
 we've
 grown.


We
 were
 in
 that
 apartment
 office
 only
 3


and
 1/2
 4
 years
 ago
 and
 now
 here
 we're


plus
 100
 people
 might
 double
 in
 the
 next


year.
 I
 think
 the
 hardest
 thing
 is
 the


job
 is
 changing
 every
 month
 or
 every


day.
 So
 like
 when
 we
 first
 started
 first


customers
 I
 was
 selling.
 I
 was
 going
 out


and
 having
 the
 conversations
 with
 them


very
 quickly.
 we
 need
 to
 scale
 that
 and


grow
 that
 and
 I
 was
 no
 longer
 selling


and
 now
 it
 was
 about
 managing
 people


that
 are
 going
 and
 having
 those


conversations
 now
 selling
 it
 actually


and
 managing
 people
 who
 are
 selling
 it


very
 different
 jobs
 doing
 it
 versus


managing
 it
 and
 the
 hard
 things
 for
 me


were
 letting
 go
 of
 the
 past
 job
 and


getting
 good
 at
 the
 new
 job
 cuz
 it's
 not


so
 fun.
 you
 like
 feel
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm


just
 starting
 to
 get
 good
 at
 this


selling
 thing,
 and
 now
 I
 got
 to
 go
 and


do
 something
 I've
 never
 done
 before,
 and


that's
 uncomfortable."
 And
 you're
 not
 so


good
 at
 it
 initially.
 And
 I
 learned


like,
 "How
 can
 I
 get
 good
 at


communicating
 why
 I
 would
 do
 it
 this


way,
 working
 through
 whether
 their
 way


is
 actually
 right,
 agreeing
 on
 some


solution,
 and
 then
 them
 taking
 it,
 you


know,
 it's
 like
 your
 baby
 and
 you
 want


to
 do
 it."
 Now,
 as
 we
 have
 like
 very


professional
 managers
 on
 the
 team,
 it's


really
 about
 building
 a
 culture.
 We


don't
 really
 compromise
 on
 are
 we


customer
 obsessed.
 I
 think
 it's


incredibly
 important
 that
 even
 as
 we
 get


to
 a
 thousand
 people
 that
 we're
 still


sitting
 next
 to
 customers.
 We're
 not


going to
 budge
 on
 that.
 But
 there's


certain
 things
 we
 absolutely
 need
 to


budge
 on
 and
 change
 because
 the


company's
 changing
 so
 much.
 So
 like
 how


do
 you
 do
 that
 at
 scale
 across
 a
 lot
 of


people
 is
 very
 different
 than
 management


which
 was
 the
 last
 job.
 Like
 letting
 go


of
 the
 last
 job
 being
 like
 okay
 this
 is


the
 new
 job
 and
 being
 okay
 with
 learning


against
 it
 and
 the
 uncomfort
 that
 comes


with
 learning.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 where


a
 lot
 of
 founders
 get
 shirped
 up
 is
 they


just
 keep
 doing
 their
 last
 job
 even


though
 the
 company
 needs
 them
 to
 do


their
 new
 job.
 And
 sometimes
 it's
 really


hard
 because
 the
 people
 want
 you
 to
 keep


doing
 your
 old
 job.
 But
 if
 I
 spent
 my


whole
 day
 with
 one-on-
 ones
 with
 every


team
 member,
 I
 probably
 wouldn't
 talk
 to


customers
 very
 much.
 I
 probably
 wouldn't


make
 very
 many
 decisions
 that
 are


important.
 And
 so
 it's
 difficult
 to
 let


go
 of
 the
 last
 the
 last
 job.


I
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 easier
 to
 build


a
 hard
 company
 than
 an
 easy
 one,
 if
 that


makes
 sense.
 there's
 this
 thing
 in
 the


world
 that
 nobody's
 done
 yet
 and
 us
 a


group
 kind
 of
 like
 ragtag
 people
 you
 put


together
 we're
 going
 to
 change
 it
 that's


like
 an
 inherently
 confident
 maybe


arrogant
 thing
 thing
 to
 say
 yet
 though


it's
 very
 easy
 to
 get
 people
 rallied


around
 that
 right
 like
 so
 when
 you
 say


something
 like
 our
 mission
 is
 to
 ensure


that
 every
 time
 somebody
 calls
 in


emergency
 they
 get
 the
 perfect
 response


they
 get
 the
 best
 possible
 help
 people


get
 excited
 about
 that
 very
 very
 hard


very
 very
 difficult
 we
 can't
 take
 that


lightly
 but
 people
 get
 excited
 so
 You


attract
 better
 talent.
 You
 attract


people
 that
 are
 willing
 to
 work
 harder


towards
 that
 thing.
 It's
 much
 easier
 to


get
 the
 right
 talent
 necessary
 for
 a


startup
 if
 you
 do
 the
 ambitious
 thing.


So
 people
 are
 like,
 "Why
 are
 you


building
 in
 public
 safety?
 That's
 a


unique
 life
 choice."
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I


ever
 thought
 it
 had
 to
 be
 me.
 I
 guess
 I


still
 think
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 have


to
 be
 me.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 one
 of
 the


most
 compelling
 reasons
 to
 work
 on
 the


company
 is
 we
 legitimately
 believe
 if
 we


didn't
 do
 the
 work,
 it
 wouldn't
 get


done.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 most
 days
 it
 feels


quite
 uncomfortable.
 I
 I
 did
 not
 come


out
 of
 a
 dorm
 room
 ready
 to
 build
 a


company.
 And
 so
 most
 of
 the
 day
 is
 doing


things
 that
 you
 you
 haven't
 done
 before,


but
 you
 have
 to
 do
 quickly.
 You
 have
 to


learn
 really
 really
 fast.
 And
 so
 a
 lot


of
 days
 I
 think,
 oh
 my
 goodness,
 why
 me?


But
 it
 does
 seem
 true
 that
 if
 we
 just


stopped
 tomorrow,
 the
 world
 would
 be


less
 safe.
 Um
 that
 the
 technology
 would


likely
 kind
 of
 fall
 back
 into
 the
 status


quo
 and
 being
 okay
 with
 decay,
 being


okay
 with
 antiquation.
 And
 the
 result
 of


that
 would
 mean
 everyday
 lost
 life.
 And


I
 don't
 feel
 okay
 with
 that.
 Our
 work


seems
 to
 be
 raising
 the
 temperature
 of


the
 space.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 as
 we
 go


out
 and
 launch
 new
 things
 that
 the
 space


hasn't
 seen
 before,
 so
 too
 are
 the
 big


companies,
 which
 is
 also
 great,
 right?
 I


tell
 the
 team
 a
 lot
 too
 that,
 you
 know,


like
 look,
 if
 we
 build
 things
 and
 then


they
 get
 mass
 distributed
 by
 somebody


else
 and
 it
 saves
 millions
 of
 lives,


that's
 freaking
 great,
 too,
 right?
 And


and
 our
 work
 will
 be,
 you
 know,
 super


successful
 even
 if
 somebody
 else
 does
 it


on
 our
 backs.
 That
 that's
 amazing
 for


the
 world.
 Yeah.
 It
 just
 feels
 like
 we


have
 to
 do
 it
 less
 that
 it
 has
 to
 be
 me.
