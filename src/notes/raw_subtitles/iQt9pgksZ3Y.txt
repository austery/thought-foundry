[Music]


very
 welcome
 to
 the
 podcast
 in
 good


company
 today
 we
 are
 joined
 by
 uh
 Ken


Griffin
 one
 of
 the
 best
 investors
 of
 all


time
 now
 Ken
 uh
 started
 his
 journey
 in


finance
 from
 his
 Harvard
 dorm
 he
 founded


Citadel
 which
 has
 a
 great
 ambition
 of


being
 the
 most
 successful
 investment


firm
 of
 all
 times
 now
 that's
 the
 kind
 of


Ambitions
 that
 we
 like
 so
 very
 welcome


Ken
 great
 to
 have
 you
 on
 it
 is
 a


pleasure
 to
 be
 here
 today
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 to
 do
 this


interview
 fantastic
 now
 what
 motivated


you
 to
 go
 into
 Finance
 in
 the
 first


place
 so
 I
 I've
 always
 been
 interested


in
 the
 stock
 market
 for
 reasons
 I
 don't


fully
 understand
 and
 in
 third
 grade
 I


wrote
 a


paper
 where
 I
 set
 forth
 that
 I
 wanted
 to


learn
 how
 the
 stock
 market
 works
 I've


been
 on
 that
 Journey
 now
 for
 almost
 40


years
 and
 I
 still
 feel
 like
 I'm
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 learning
 curve
 the


equity
 markets
 around
 the
 world
 are
 just


a
 wash
 in
 interesting
 and
 complex


problems


the
 intersection
 of
 business
 models


earnings
 and
 then
 the
 psychology
 of


investors
 it's
 it's
 really
 an
 endless


journey
 of
 learning
 trying
 to
 appreciate


how
 to
 Value
 businesses
 and
 how
 to
 be
 a


successful
 investor
 in
 the
 stock
 market


it
 is
 just
 the
 most
 complex
 game
 in
 the


world
 now
 when
 you
 um
 started
 back
 at


your
 Harvard
 dorm
 what
 was
 your
 vision


what
 do
 you
 think
 this
 could
 be
 well


what's
 what's
 interesting
 is
 in
 my


college
 dorm
 as
 a
 freshman
 I
 bought
 two


put
 contracts
 in
 home
 Shopping
 Network


and
 in
 some
 sense
 I
 owe
 my
 career
 to


good
 journalism
 there
 was
 an
 article
 in


Forbes
 by
 gret
 morgenson
 where
 she
 set


forth
 a
 thesis
 as
 to
 why
 Home
 Shopping


Network
 was
 the
 meme
 stock
 of
 that


moment
 in
 time
 and
 I
 I
 loved
 her
 thesis


I
 bought
 these
 two-p
 put
 contracts
 and


fortunately
 from
 the
 perspective
 of
 my


career
 the
 stock
 Creator
 shortly


thereafter
 and
 ready
 for
 this
 I
 made
 a


few


thousand
 but
 great
 you
 and
 I
 both
 know


when
 you're
 when
 you're
 a
 freshman
 in


college
 if
 you
 make
 $2,000
 or
 $3,000


that's
 all
 the
 money
 in
 the
 world
 when
 I


sold
 those
 put
 contracts
 the
 market


maker
 paid
 me
 less
 than
 their
 intrinsic


value
 and
 that
 made
 me
 very
 curious


about
 the
 pricing
 of
 derivatives
 because


I
 realized
 that
 I
 got
 very
 lucky
 in


buying
 those
 puts
 with
 an
 expiration


that
 fell
 after
 the
 stock
 had
 cratered


but
 the
 market
 maker
 made
 a
 risk-free


profit
 and
 I
 was
 very
 very
 interested
 in


trying
 to
 learn
 about
 the
 pricing
 of


derivatives
 and
 that
 took
 me
 to


understanding
 the
 pricing
 of
 convertible


bonds
 which
 is
 the
 area
 that
 I
 started


in
 from
 my
 college
 dorm
 room
 when
 I


began
 my
 first
 hedge
 fund
 do
 you
 think


there
 are
 um
 as
 many
 opportunities
 in


the
 markets
 now
 as
 they
 were
 when
 you


started
 I
 think
 the
 opportunity
 sets


different
 today
 than
 when
 I
 started
 you


know
 obviously
 the
 commodation
 of
 the


knowhow
 of
 how
 to
 price
 derivatives
 for


example
 has
 been
 has
 been
 incredible
 you


know
 there's
 tremendous
 number
 of


programs
 around
 the
 world
 with
 Masters


in
 PhD
 and
 financial
 engineering
 so
 as


as
 a
 society
 we've
 really
 increased
 our


knowhow
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 investing
 but


conversely
 the
 markets
 today
 are
 much


much
 bigger
 and
 they're
 Global
 and


there's
 far
 more
 product
 proliferation


there
 will
 always
 be
 Niche
 opportunities


for
 investors
 to
 to
 gain
 an
 Insight
 with


and
 to
 have
 a
 competitive
 advantage
 in


trading
 what
 were
 some
 of
 the
 mistakes


you
 made
 in
 the
 beginning
 which
 you


learned
 from
 and
 have
 built
 on
 I
 mean
 i'


I've
 made
 every
 mistake
 you
 can
 possibly


make
 and
 unfortunately
 I've
 made
 some
 of


them
 two
 or
 three
 times
 so
 the
 key
 in


finance
 though
 is
 to
 try
 to
 learn
 from


both
 your


successes
 and
 from
 your
 failures
 and
 I


think
 that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 people


do
 too
 too
 often
 is
 they
 don't
 study


their
 winners
 they
 don't
 try
 to
 learn


what
 did
 they
 get
 right
 in
 that
 winning


trade
 because
 let's
 be
 clear
 you
 make


you
 make
 money
 in
 finance
 when
 you
 have


winners
 and
 we
 all
 tend
 to
 put
 way
 too


much
 emphasis
 on
 trying
 to
 learn
 from


our
 losers
 and
 not
 nearly
 enough


emphasis
 in
 trying
 to
 learn
 learn
 from


our
 winners
 so
 so
 what
 have
 been
 your


big
 Winners
 what
 I
 mean
 what
 what
 if
 you


were
 to
 try
 to
 summarize
 your
 your
 kind


of
 winning
 strategies
 what
 what's
 been


the
 best
 things
 you've
 done
 so
 where
 we


are
 most


successful
 as
 investors
 is
 where
 we
 have


a
 clear
 competitive
 advantage
 in


assimilating
 information
 processing
 that


information
 and
 reacting
 to
 that


information
 that's
 that's
 where
 we
 do


best
 and
 so
 we
 architect
 The
 Firm
 around


this
 principle
 of
 we
 are
 in
 we're
 in
 the


research
 business
 and
 the
 core
 of
 this


business
 is
 research
 it's
 good


oldfashioned
 whether
 it's
 stock
 picking


or
 forecasting
 the
 weather
 to
 trade


Commodities
 it's
 a
 research
 business


first
 and
 foremost
 and


trading
 is
 simply
 how
 we
 monetize
 our


research
 it's
 just
 that
 simple


when
 you
 look
 at
 all
 your
 data
 points


and
 all
 your
 research
 now
 where
 is
 the


US
 economy
 so
 if
 if
 I
 if
 I
 look
 at
 the


Mosaic
 of
 the
 data
 points
 that
 we
 have


in
 the
 US
 economy
 today
 we're
 in
 a
 very


interesting
 unchartered
 territory
 you


and
 I
 have
 have
 both
 studied
 economics


our
 entire
 life
 in
 one
 form
 or
 another


let
 me
 just
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 would


you've
 ever
 imagined
 the
 United
 States


to
 be
 at
 near
 full


employment
 with
 inflation
 running


somewhere
 around
 3
 and
 change
 percent


and
 yet
 the
 government
 is
 on
 a
 massive


spending
 binge
 no
 I
 wouldn't
 have


expected
 that
 I
 mean
 as
 economists
 we


are
 we
 are
 just
 in
 Uncharted
 Territory


that
 we
 are
 at
 that
 PO
 moment
 in
 the


cycle
 where
 generally
 you're
 trying
 to


pay
 down
 your
 government
 debt
 you're


trying
 to
 put
 your
 fiscal
 house
 in
 order


you're
 trying
 to
 create
 that
 capacity
 to


have
 flexibility
 when
 the
 rainy
 day


inevitably
 comes
 and
 yet
 right
 here


right
 now
 with
 the
 US
 economy
 pretty


much
 growing
 at
 or
 Beyond
 capacity
 the


government
 is
 still
 engaged
 in
 a
 massive


massive
 degree
 of
 fiscal
 stimulus
 that's


creating
 hotter
 inflation
 than
 we
 would


like
 to
 see
 in
 the
 economy
 and
 it
 is


leaving
 the
 United
 States
 in
 a
 more


precarious
 long-term
 position
 and
 having


fewer
 degrees
 of
 freedom
 to
 deal
 with


the
 next
 the
 next
 recession
 or
 God


forbid
 depression
 you
 are
 um
 a
 vocal


Advocate
 about
 the
 fiscal
 deficit
 and


the
 dangers
 of
 it
 um
 why
 are
 you
 so


concerned
 about
 it
 what's
 what's
 I
 mean


the
 the
 you
 and
 I
 both
 grew
 up
 in
 the


era
 of
 fears
 about
 crowding
 out
 that
 the


scale
 the
 government
 deficits
 around
 the


world
 would
 crowd
 out
 private
 sector


access
 to
 Capital
 and
 of
 course
 that's


that
 fear
 still
 exists
 amongst
 those
 of


us
 who
 think
 about
 a
 very
 long-term


process
 how
 do
 we
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 do


not
 crowd
 out
 the
 private
 sector
 from


propagate
 government
 spending
 but


there's
 a
 there's
 another
 important


point
 which
 is
 the
 matter
 of
 of
 equity


you
 know
 there's
 an
 incredible
 Focus


around
 the
 world
 today
 around
 Equity
 our


our
 is
 income
 inequality
 for
 example
 too


high
 this
 is
 an
 incredible
 moment
 of


just
 in
 some
 sense
 um
 we're
 borrowing


from
 the
 future
 we're
 borrowing
 from
 our


children
 our
 grandchildren
 and
 our
 great


grandchildren
 right
 here
 right
 now
 to


maintain
 a
 standard
 of
 living
 that
 is


not
 in
 sync
 with
 either
 productivity
 or


with
 the
 culture
 of
 work
 that's
 emerging


across
 the
 developed
 economy
 it's
 just


not
 fair
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 equity
 across


generations
 for
 us
 to
 be
 engaged
 in
 this


level
 of
 spending
 in
 the
 form
 that
 we're


spending
 the


money
 right
 here
 right
 now
 in
 my
 P
 in
 my


opinion
 so
 if
 you
 were
 advising
 the


president
 or
 indeed
 were
 in
 charge
 of


the
 country's
 finances
 what
 would
 you
 do


look
 job
 number
 one
 is
 we
 need
 to


improve
 productivity
 in
 the
 western


world
 like
 there's
 nothing
 more


important
 than
 we
 need
 to
 do
 than
 to


increase
 productivity
 both
 in
 Europe
 and


the
 United
 States
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the


path
 to
 sustain
 Prosperity
 now
 how
 do
 we


improve
 productivity
 you
 and
 I
 both
 know


we
 need
 to
 improve
 our
 education
 system


particularly
 in
 the
 United
 States
 K


through2
 education
 is
 leaving
 our


children
 at
 a
 material
 competitive


disadvantage
 relative
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world
 and
 more
 importantly
 in
 an


absolute
 disadvantage
 in
 life
 they
 just


aren't
 having
 the
 exposure
 to
 the
 ideas


and
 Concepts
 that
 will
 that
 will
 give


them
 give
 them
 their
 ability
 to
 earn
 a


rewarding
 and
 Rich
 career
 number
 two
 is


the
 work
 from
 home
 phenomena
 is


unquestionably
 reducing
 mentorship


collaboration
 leadership
 development
 and


Innovation
 and
 it's
 time
 that
 we
 bring


our
 people
 back
 together
 to
 collaborate


and
 to
 mentor
 and
 to
 develop
 leaders
 so


that
 in
 20
 or
 30
 years
 we're
 not


left
 we're
 not
 left
 in
 the
 very


frightening
 predicament
 of
 having
 a


leader
 ership
 deficit
 in
 the
 western


world
 because
 of
 today's
 work
 practices


and
 I
 worry
 about
 that
 so
 no
 home
 no


home
 office
 in
 citel
 uh
 no
 we
 uh
 we're


all
 back
 at
 work
 and
 the
 wonderful
 thing


is
 the
 mental
 health
 ramifications
 are


profound
 it's
 it's
 so
 great
 to
 see
 my


colleagues
 meaningfully
 engaged
 in
 their


work
 happy
 in
 their
 work
 and
 having
 that


separation
 of
 personal
 life
 and


professional
 life
 so
 education
 back
 to


office
 what
 else
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 so


education
 back
 to
 office
 off
 thoughtful


government
 regulation
 that
 encourages


that
 encourages
 entrepreneurship
 that


encourages
 the
 growth
 of
 small
 and


medium
 Enterprises
 that
 creates
 more


competition
 in
 our
 economy
 that's
 really


important
 and
 the
 West
 must
 continue
 to


engage
 in
 trade
 policies
 that
 really


bring
 the
 benefits
 of
 free
 trade
 across


North
 America
 and
 Europe
 so
 some
 of
 the


trends
 towards
 protectionism
 between
 our


two
 continents
 we
 really
 really
 need
 to


think
 about
 push
 pulling
 back
 on
 and


creating
 greater
 economic
 integration


now
 when
 we
 look
 at
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 are
 we
 um
 is
 the
 stock
 market
 in


a
 bubble
 or
 how
 do
 you
 see
 the
 stock


market
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 always
 it's


always
 very
 hard
 to
 know
 when
 you're
 in


a
 bubble
 because
 when
 you're
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 bubble
 you
 have
 the
 clear


justification
 for
 why
 prices
 are
 where


they
 are
 you
 know
 you
 and
 I
 can
 go
 back


to
 the
 dot
 bubble
 what
 were
 the
 key


things
 that
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 back


in
 the
 hey
 the.com
 bubble
 do
 you
 do
 you


remember
 some
 of
 those
 conversations


right
 it
 was
 about
 how
 e-commerce
 was


going
 to
 radically
 change
 the
 way
 that


we
 secured
 Goods
 metrics
 like
 eyeballs


on
 pages
 became
 the
 dominant
 pricing


metrics
 for
 Securities
 but
 we
 created
 a


whole
 lingo
 a
 whole
 vocabulary
 a
 whole


set
 of
 Frameworks
 to
 justify
 and


rationalize
 the
 bubble
 that
 was
 taking


place
 back
 at
 the
 height
 of
 the
 do


frenzy
 now
 what's
 interesting
 is
 jump


for
 20
 years
 and
 many
 of
 the
 things
 that


we
 thought
 were
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the


Revolution
 have
 actually
 happened
 and


many
 of
 the
 biggest
 companies
 in
 the


world
 today
 are
 actually


symbolically
 the
 same
 businesses
 or


similar
 businesses
 to
 what
 we
 had
 all


envisioned
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the


revolution
 of
 the
 dot
 phenomena
 so


what's
 interesting
 is
 is
 we
 had
 the


right
 thesis
 we
 had
 the
 right
 ideas
 but


people
 just
 got
 carried
 away
 in


valuations
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and
 are


we
 carried
 away
 now
 with
 are
 we
 carried


away
 now
 with
 the
 AI
 evaluations
 the
 AI


the
 AI
 um
 frenes
 is
 pretty
 pretty


amazing
 to
 watch
 what's
 going
 to
 be


fascinating
 is
 how


fast
 do
 we
 see
 some
 of
 the
 AI
 wins


incorporated
 into
 both
 our
 daily
 lives


and
 into
 how
 we
 run
 our
 businesses
 that


speed
 of
 adoption
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 quick
 there's
 a
 second
 Trend


though
 that's
 happening
 right
 here
 right


now
 it's
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 importance
 of


your
 Chief
 Information
 or
 chief


technology
 officer


once
 again
 in
 the
 SE
 Suite
 in
 the


boardroom
 there's
 a
 real
 focus
 on


digitalization
 and
 the
 use
 of
 software


and
 analytics
 to
 improve
 your
 business


so
 what's
 really
 interesting
 is
 when
 you


talk
 to
 CEOs
 they'll
 tell
 you
 about
 how


their
 companies
 embraced
 Ai
 and
 how
 it's


making
 these
 profound
 impacts
 on
 their


business
 now
 if
 you
 peel
 back
 the
 union


of
 most
 these
 stories
 there's
 no
 AI


involved
 at
 all
 but
 what
 is
 involved
 is


an
 embracing
 of
 the
 use
 of
 modern


capabilities
 and
 digitalization
 to


really
 improve
 and
 enhance
 American
 and


European
 businesses
 so
 what's
 what's
 I


find
 to
 be
 really
 great
 is
 that
 AI
 has


reopened
 the
 dialogue
 about
 how
 to
 use


technology
 to
 make
 our
 businesses
 more


successful
 and
 more
 effective
 to


delivering
 goods
 and
 value
 to
 Consumers


and
 can
 how
 do
 you
 Embrace
 AI
 at
 C
 so
 we


use
 it
 in
 a
 number
 of
 ways
 to
 enhance


productivity
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out
 amongst


our
 team
 members
 in
 some
 sense
 the
 way


that
 many
 of
 us
 will
 use
 AI
 over
 the


next
 two
 or
 three
 years
 helping
 to
 draft


emails
 helping
 to
 summarize
 research


pieces
 helping
 to
 understand
 or
 how
 to


write
 uh
 the
 introductions
 to
 Memos
 and


other
 documentation
 that's
 required
 in


the
 day-to-day
 flow
 of
 business
 we
 also


use
 it
 for
 some
 very
 mundane
 tasks
 for


example
 to
 help
 tag
 data
 and
 then
 we
 use


it
 for
 some
 very
 important
 tasks
 such
 as


how
 to
 help
 our
 software
 Engineers
 be


more
 productive
 so
 we've
 had
 a
 a
 Litany


of
 uses
 of
 AI
 within
 our
 four
 walls
 if


we
 go
 back
 to
 machine
 learning
 which
 in


some
 sense
 is
 the
 tree
 from
 Rich
 AI


Sprouts
 we've
 used
 machine
 learning
 for


over
 looking
 at
 the
 the
 date
 here
 on
 the


screen
 for
 about
 eight
 or
 nine
 years


here
 at


Citadel
 and
 machine
 learning
 plays
 a


very
 important
 role
 in
 how
 we
 think


about
 the
 pricing
 of
 assets
 and
 has
 a


small
 role
 in
 US
 thinking
 about
 risk


management
 of
 assets
 from
 time
 to
 time


but
 pricing
 of
 assets
 machine
 learning


does
 play
 an
 important
 role
 here
 at


Citadel
 Ken
 love
 to
 go
 back
 to
 when
 you


started
 Citadel
 and
 the
 vision
 you
 had


for
 the
 firm
 um
 so
 when
 you
 set
 it
 up


what
 did
 you
 think
 it
 could
 be
 well


that's
 um
 that's
 a
 walk
 down
 memory
 lane


and
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 history
 that


that's
 not


revisionist
 20
 years
 old
 I
 had
 an


opportunity
 to
 manage
 a
 million
 dollars


for
 a
 fund
 of
 funds
 that
 was
 based
 in


Chicago
 and
 if
 I
 did
 well
 they'd
 help
 me


leave
 start
 my
 own
 business
 and
 raised


some
 capital
 for
 me
 so
 Citadel
 was


started
 just
 over
 a
 year
 after
 I


finished
 College
 we
 raised
 about
 4
 A5


million
 dollar
 of
 November
 of


1990
 and
 we
 started
 with
 one
 strategy


which
 was
 the
 trading
 of
 equity
 link


derivatives
 convertible
 bonds
 and


warrants
 as
 compared
 to
 the
 common
 stock


so
 that
 was
 that
 was
 the
 Genesis
 of


Citadel
 now
 there
 was
 there's
 a
 couple


of
 key
 things
 that
 are
 important
 in
 the


story
 number
 one
 is
 I
 believed
 you
 could


use


mathematics
 and


software
 to
 help
 to
 understand
 these


pricing


relationships
 in
 an
 area
 where
 most
 of


the
 world
 was
 still
 using
 paper
 pencils


and
 rules
 of
 thumb
 and
 I
 remember
 we


hired
 a
 rocket
 scientist
 back
 in
 those


days
 to
 help
 work
 on
 these
 priceing


models
 and
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 from
 a


major
 Bank
 literally
 called
 me
 sort
 of


laughing
 he's
 like
 you're
 not
 trying
 to


put
 a
 man
 on
 the
 moon
 you're
 trying
 to


trade
 bonds
 now
 jump
 forward
 30
 some


years
 that
 bank
 he
 worked
 for
 is
 no


longer
 in
 business
 and
 Citadel
 and


Citadel
 Securities
 are
 two
 of
 the
 most


important
 firms
 in
 the
 world
 in
 the


financial
 markets
 we
 did
 we
 did
 manage


to
 in
 some
 sense
 ride
 the
 wave
 of
 the


rise
 of
 mathematics
 in
 finance
 which
 has


in
 some
 sense
 long
 since
 crested
 we
 all


take
 for
 granted
 the
 mathematical


Concepts
 that
 were
 really
 first
 utilized


in
 the
 80s
 and
 90s
 in
 our
 day-to-day


work
 today
 what's
 been
 the
 challenges
 in


riding
 this
 wave
 so
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the


largest
 challenge
 in
 riding
 this
 wave


has
 been
 the
 necessity
 to
 create
 your


own
 Talent
 so
 in
 the
 early
 days
 you
 had


to
 hire
 people
 with
 very
 very
 different


backgrounds
 from
 the
 backgrounds


typically
 found
 on
 Wall
 Street
 at
 that


point
 in
 time
 physicists
 nuclear


Engineers


mathematicians
 you
 had
 a
 hire
 people
 who


had
 a
 very
 different
 background
 in


pedigree
 than
 you
 typically
 found
 on
 a


Wall
 Street
 trading
 desk
 and
 you
 had
 to


teach
 them
 about
 finance
 and
 you
 had
 to


get
 them
 engaged
 in
 solving
 how
 do
 you


value
 derivatives
 how
 do
 you
 value


complex
 Securities
 and
 there
 was
 a
 there


was
 a
 knowledge
 Gap
 that
 had
 to
 be


crossed
 or
 bridged
 between
 those
 of
 us


who
 were
 committing
 the
 capital
 and


those
 of
 us
 who
 were
 helping
 to
 write


the
 analytics
 with
 which
 we
 made
 these


decisions
 your
 ability
 to
 to
 innovate


and
 to
 grow
 successfully
 into
 new
 areas


of
 Finance
 uh
 is
 quite
 quite
 unique
 to


to
 Cel
 so
 why
 do
 you
 think
 you're
 being


so
 successful
 here
 look
 I
 think
 there's


something
 that
 we
 do
 that's
 very


different
 than
 most


firms
 everyone
 agrees
 that
 there
 is
 an


art
 to
 investing
 but
 there's
 also
 a


science
 and
 when
 we
 think
 about
 running


this
 firm
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out
 we
 really


think
 about
 the
 union
 of
 the
 art
 and
 the


science
 of
 investing
 in
 how
 we
 make
 our


investment
 decision-making
 processes


work
 number
 two
 is
 I
 think
 we
 bring
 a


rigor
 and
 discipline
 to
 trying
 to


understand
 where
 we
 create


differentiated
 insights
 that
 give
 us


confidence
 in
 deploying


capital
 and
 then
 third
 is
 is
 it's


experience
 it's
 the
 it's
 the
 price


paid
 in
 losses
 and
 pain
 that
 converts


into


wisdom
 my
 leadership
 team
 we've
 been


through
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 difficult
 moments


of
 the
 markets
 together
 we've
 learned


some
 very
 bitter
 lessons
 but
 it
 makes
 us


much
 more
 effective
 as
 investors
 in


periods
 of
 turmoil
 and
 crisis
 one
 other


thing
 which
 has
 changed
 during
 this


period
 is
 much
 more
 passive
 Capital
 much


more
 short-term
 capital
 now
 how
 how
 do


you
 see
 that
 um
 how
 do
 you
 see
 that
 that


has
 changed
 the
 world
 for
 more
 long-term


filamental
 investors
 like
 us
 so
 what's


very
 interesting
 is
 the
 rise
 of
 passive


investing
 plays
 to
 the
 realization
 that


markets
 are
 either
 efficient
 or
 semi-


efficient
 and
 it's
 a
 way
 for
 investors


to
 have
 lowcost
 exposure
 to
 either
 broad


indices
 to
 the
 world
 as
 a
 whole
 or
 to


specific
 sectors
 without
 having
 to
 pay


the
 fees
 of
 active
 management
 it's
 a


it's
 been
 revolutionary
 for
 the
 world


this
 embracing
 of
 of
 passive
 investing


but
 passive
 investing
 only
 works
 if


there's
 a
 miningful
 community
 of
 people


involved
 in
 fundamental
 research
 who
 are


helping
 to
 set
 the
 pricing
 of
 Securities


so
 passive
 investing
 requires
 requires


the
 existence
 of
 capable
 successful
 and


competitive
 traditional
 asset


managers
 for
 the
 theory
 that
 underlies


passive
 investing
 to
 actually
 play
 out


to
 actually
 manifest
 itself
 so
 the
 rise


of
 short-term
 investors
 helps
 to
 ensure


that
 markets
 are
 efficient
 with
 respect


to
 news
 that's
 rapidly
 evolving
 but
 we


should
 really
 try
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 take
 every
 step
 possible
 to
 make


it
 that
 traditional
 asset
 managers
 have


the
 ability
 to
 have
 prosperous
 and


successful
 firms
 because
 they
 are
 so


critical
 in
 the
 price
 Discovery
 process


that
 passive
 investing
 depends
 upon
 so


given
 given
 all
 this
 um
 if
 you're
 an


equity
 investor
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think


is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 make
 money
 now
 look
 I


think
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 to
 where
 you're


situated
 in
 the
 financial


Market
 if
 you
 are
 if
 you
 have
 a


full-time
 job
 as
 a
 lawyer
 or
 dentist
 or


as
 a
 teacher
 you
 should
 be
 in
 a


broad-based
 equity
 index
 product
 or
 an


actively
 managed
 pool
 of
 capital
 that's


broadly
 based
 in
 its
 management
 let's


say
 you
 were
 running
 the
 Norwegian
 Sone


wealth
 fund
 well
 I
 I
 know
 as
 a
 as
 a


factual
 matter
 that
 that
 you
 are
 very


thoughtful
 about
 indexing
 a
 substantial


portion
 of
 your
 Capital
 to
 indexes
 that


you've
 developed
 over
 the
 years
 around


the
 world
 and
 that
 gives
 you
 very


lowcost
 exposure
 to
 the
 holistic
 growth


and
 profitability
 that
 we
 have
 watched


play
 out
 around
 the
 world
 in
 various


countries
 it
 is
 a
 very
 thoughtful
 way
 to


deploy
 the
 massive
 quantities
 of
 capital


that
 you
 have
 to
 deploy
 and
 you're
 also


investing
 in
 assets
 away
 from
 equities


and
 then
 using
 a
 variety
 of
 either


external
 managers
 or
 internal


capabilities
 depending
 upon
 what
 you


view
 to
 be
 the
 relative
 competitive


advantages
 of
 the
 in-house
 team
 and
 the


external
 managers
 this
 is
 how
 I
 would


recommend
 any
 large
 pool
 of
 count


Capital
 to
 be
 managed
 to
 do
 what
 can
 be


done
 effectively
 cost
 effectively


inhouse
 and
 then
 to
 find
 around
 the


world
 your
 best
 breed
 managers
 and
 the


various
 strategies
 that
 give
 your


portfolio
 diversification
 very
 uh
 I'm


very
 uh
 thankful
 for
 that
 approval
 of


how
 we
 do
 things
 there
 up
 in
 uh
 up
 in


Norway
 um
 now
 to
 be
 clear
 you
 know
 part


of
 the
 reason
 that
 I'm
 sure
 that
 you


walked
 away
 from
 your
 career
 as
 a
 very


successful
 hedge
 fund
 manager
 is
 you


believe
 in
 the
 same
 ethos
 of
 how
 Capital


should
 be
 deployed
 absolutely
 I
 I
 so
 I


agree
 entirely
 with
 you
 there
 now
 um
 34


years
 after
 Inception
 um
 you
 know
 we


have
 the
 scorecard
 you've
 been


incredibly
 successful
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 stay
 at
 the
 top
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure


that
 you
 are
 still
 hungry
 so
 there's


there's
 very
 different
 questions
 in
 that


question
 we're
 going
 to
 unpack
 it
 a


little
 bit
 how
 does
 citadel
 continue
 to


prosper
 we
 have
 an
 incredible
 leadership


team
 I
 have
 worldclass
 leaders
 here
 at


Citadel
 that
 are
 running
 our
 very
 ious


businesses
 and
 I'm
 grateful
 for
 them


being
 part
 of
 this
 team
 I'm
 also


constantly
 engaged
 with
 my
 leadership


team
 on
 how
 to
 improve
 and
 strengthen


our
 investment
 strategies
 so
 a
 constant


level
 of
 Engagement
 with
 my
 senior


leadership
 team
 on
 the
 core
 problems
 of


recruiting
 great


talent
 developing
 great
 Risk
 Takers


making
 sure
 that
 we
 push
 Capital
 into


the
 hands
 of
 our
 best
 Risk
 Takers
 when


the
 best
 opportunities
 present


themselves
 so
 there's
 a
 huge
 emphasis
 on


just
 human
 capital
 development
 and


deployment
 of
 capital
 with
 our
 best


people
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 second
 thread


in
 everything
 we
 do
 how
 do
 we
 build
 a


competitive
 Advantage
 how
 do
 we
 gather


information
 better
 how
 do
 we
 make
 better


decisions
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 do
 is
 uh


to
 have
 multi
 managers
 and
 these
 whole


Concepts
 um
 how
 how
 are
 the
 teams


structured
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 this


so
 we
 think
 about
 the
 business
 as
 a


variety
 of
 verticals
 for
 example
 a


global
 Commodities
 business
 a
 a
 long


short
 equities
 business
 a
 variety
 of


credit
 businesses
 within
 each
 vertical


we
 ask
 our
 Business
 Leaders
 to
 act
 as


entrepreneurs
 and
 to
 really
 to
 say
 to


yourself
 I
 have
 for
 all
 intents
 and


purposes
 access
 to
 unlimited
 capital


from
 that
 Vantage
 Point
 what's
 the
 right


team
 the
 right
 strategies
 and
 the
 right


competitive
 advantages
 to
 build
 and


utilize
 in
 today's
 world
 in
 today's


environment
 that's
 that's
 how
 we
 run
 our


businesses
 it's
 very
 much
 a
 mindset
 of


clean
 sheet
 of
 paper
 what
 should
 we
 be


doing
 today
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most


effective
 deployers
 of
 capital
 in
 the


world's
 financial
 markets
 does
 each
 team


decide
 their
 investment
 strategy
 so
 the


investment
 strategies
 are
 decide
 are
 are


are
 hone
 between
 the
 portfolio
 managers


the
 business
 heads
 and
 myself
 so
 it's


it's
 the
 three
 three
 of
 us
 will
 come


together
 depending
 upon
 the
 nature
 of


the
 problem
 and
 work
 together
 to
 try
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we've
 really
 thought


through
 how
 to
 create
 the
 most


successful
 investment
 strategies
 that
 we


can
 possibly
 create
 so
 now
 you
 give
 me


um
 $100
 million
 I
 work
 for


you
 uh
 how
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 my


mistakes
 well
 I
 mean
 first
 of
 all
 um


we'd
 like
 to
 give
 you
 a
 lot
 more
 than


$100
 million
 to
 manage
 okay
 um
 thank
 for


thank
 you
 all
 right
 and
 and
 part
 of
 this


is
 you
 know
 we're
 bringing
 really
 great


people
 here
 we
 want
 them
 to
 have
 access


to
 sufficient
 Capital
 to
 have
 both
 the


revenues
 and
 the
 profitability
 to


support
 superlative
 teams
 around
 them
 we


really
 view
 investing
 as
 the
 undertaking


of
 worldclass
 teams
 because
 within
 teams


you
 have
 a
 much
 healthier
 debate
 and


dialogue
 that
 helps
 one
 uncover
 the


truth
 to
 uncover
 the
 real
 essence
 of
 the


debate
 that's
 at
 Play
 and
 that's
 so


important
 to
 how
 we
 run
 our
 business
 so


when
 we
 would
 hire
 you
 as
 a
 portfolio


manager
 we'd
 really
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


to
 understand
 number
 one
 what
 team
 do
 we


put
 around
 you
 and
 how
 to
 recruit
 the


best
 and
 brightest
 to
 be
 on
 your
 team


and
 then
 number
 two
 is
 we
 want
 to
 be


very
 engaged
 with
 you
 in
 making
 sure


that
 you
 have
 an
 investment
 process


that's
 repeatable
 that
 you
 learn
 from


and
 you
 learn
 from
 both
 again
 your


successes
 and
 your
 failures
 and
 that
 you


can
 teach
 this
 process
 to
 your
 team


members
 to
 to
 create
 operating
 leverage


for
 yourself
 so
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 think
 about
 when
 you
 join


the
 firm
 as
 a
 new
 portfolio
 manager
 when


do
 you
 sack
 me
 well
 let's
 be
 clear
 we


don't
 want
 to
 sack
 you
 we
 want
 to
 see


you
 have
 an
 incredibly
 successful
 career


why
 do
 people's
 careers
 derail
 why
 do


people
 run
 into
 tough
 tough
 predicaments


there's
 a
 couple
 of
 reasons
 number
 one


is
 some
 people
 just
 to
 be
 blunt
 they're


just
 not
 good
 Risk
 Takers
 you
 can
 put


the
 facts
 right
 in
 front
 of
 their
 face


you
 have
 a
 portfolio
 that
 is


extraordinar
 highly


concentrated
 your
 large
 positions
 you


cannot
 demonstrate
 a
 clear
 and
 concise


competitive
 advantage
 in
 why
 you
 own


those
 positions
 if
 these
 go
 Ary
 we
 don't


have
 a
 basis
 to
 work
 together
 and
 there


are
 some
 people
 that
 just
 with
 full


information
 are
 unable
 to
 help


themselves
 and
 get
 to
 a
 better
 portfolio


construction
 you
 talk
 about
 information


um
 many
 times
 and
 um
 you
 are
 one
 of
 the


really
 great
 users
 of
 alternative
 data


tell
 us
 about
 some
 of
 the
 type
 of


alternative
 data
 sources
 that
 you
 use


what
 what
 types
 of
 alternative
 data
 do


we
 use
 yeah
 so
 it
 really
 depends
 upon


the
 nature
 of
 where
 we're
 investing
 if


you're
 investing
 in
 Airlines
 you're
 very


interested
 in
 prevailing
 airfares
 if


you're
 trying
 to
 forecast
 inflation


you're
 literally
 breaking
 down
 every


element
 of
 what
 the
 BLS
 looks
 for
 in
 the


United
 States
 and
 producing
 their


inflation
 forecast
 if
 you
 are
 um


involved
 in
 the
 Commodities
 markets
 you


might
 be
 running
 a
 worldclass


meteorology
 effort
 to
 try
 to
 predict


short-term
 weather
 patterns
 or
 a


dispersion
 of
 short-term
 weather


patterns
 so
 you're
 going
 to
 focus
 your


use
 of
 data
 and
 alternative
 data
 to
 the


nature
 of
 the
 problem
 at
 hand
 so
 we're


always
 trying
 to
 peel
 back
 the
 onion
 and


understand
 what
 information
 is
 important


to
 driving
 the
 revenues
 of
 a
 business
 or


the
 demand
 for
 a
 commodity
 and
 how
 do
 we


secure
 that
 information
 in
 an


appropriate
 way
 process
 it
 quickly
 and


make
 good
 decisions
 with
 it
 changing
 tax


up
 here
 um
 you
 mentioned
 that
 already


back
 at
 uh
 at
 University
 you
 were
 um
 you


were
 uh
 fascinated
 by
 market
 makers
 and


then
 now
 you
 made
 Citadel
 Securities


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 most


sophisticated
 market
 makers
 so
 first
 of


all
 just
 for
 the
 for
 the
 people
 who
 who


listen
 to
 who
 don't
 know
 what
 is
 the


role
 of
 a
 market
 maker
 in
 finance
 why
 is


this
 important
 so
 a
 market
 maker


is
 a
 firm
 that
 provides
 liquidity
 to


buyers
 and
 sellers
 who
 are
 not


contemporar
 contemporar
 meeting
 each


other
 Marketplace
 which
 means
 that
 when


you
 go
 to
 sell
 $50
 million
 of
 a


stock
 if
 there's
 not
 a
 buyer
 in
 the


Market
 at
 the
 exact
 same
 instant
 you're


not
 pushing
 that
 stock
 price
 unduly
 the


market
 maker
 will
 use
 their
 Capital
 to


facilitate
 your
 trade
 and
 then
 we'll


hope
 to
 find


the
 eventual
 buyer
 of
 your
 stock
 at
 some


point
 in
 the


future
 and
 we
 do
 this
 in
 a
 in
 a
 massive


scale
 around
 the
 world
 in
 fixed
 income


and
 Equity
 products
 you
 know
 for
 example


massive
 how
 massive
 in
 the
 United
 States


we
 trade
 almost


25%
 of
 all
 the
 equity
 that
 trades
 every


day
 big
 numbers
 huh
 $400
 billion
 dollar


daily
 turnover
 across
 all
 asset
 classes


here
 at
 Citadel
 Securities
 what
 do
 you


think
 Citadel
 Securities
 would
 look
 like


in
 5
 to
 10
 years
 time
 look
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 look
 very
 similar
 to
 how
 we


look


today
 but
 we'll
 deepen
 across
 more


products
 we'll
 rich
 and
 will'll
 expand


its
 reach
 across
 more
 trading
 partners


and
 we
 offer
 a
 variety
 of
 other
 services


that
 investors
 really
 value
 such
 as


corporate
 access
 access
 to
 new
 issuance


it
 will
 broaden
 its
 scale
 and
 scope
 over


the
 years
 to
 come
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 Sol


seek
 to
 solve
 the
 challenges
 and


problems
 that
 are
 are
 and


um
 clients
 face
 well
 for
 sure
 really


really


impressive
 um
 now
 moving
 on
 to
 uh
 the


bigger
 picture
 just
 what
 do
 you
 make
 out


of
 today's
 geopolitical
 situation
 you


know
 you
 and
 I
 have
 been
 very
 fortunate


we
 have
 really
 grown
 up
 through
 an
 era


of
 peace
 until
 the
 last
 until
 the
 last


two
 and
 change
 years
 and
 it's
 it's


heartbreaking
 to
 watch
 the
 war
 play
 out


in
 the
 Ukraine
 this
 is
 this
 is
 one
 of


the
 you
 know
 would
 you
 ever
 thought


there'd
 be
 a
 war
 in
 Europe
 in
 your


lifetime
 again
 no
 all
 right
 and
 and


we're
 watching
 that
 happen
 right
 here


right
 now
 and
 the
 horrible
 loss
 of
 life


and
 the
 devastating
 impact
 of
 the


Ukrainian
 people
 and
 the
 economy
 with


this
 war
 that
 they're
 entangled
 with


with
 the
 Russians
 it's
 it's
 really
 it's


heartbreaking
 and
 then
 of
 course
 just
 a


few
 days
 ago
 we
 saw
 the
 Iranians
 take
 a


strike
 at
 Israel
 Israel
 has
 been
 under


great
 duress
 the
 Middle
 East
 probably


not
 as
 much
 of
 a
 surprise
 as
 the
 war
 in


the
 Ukraine
 the
 Middle
 East
 has
 always


been
 more
 susceptible
 to
 to
 geopolitical


challenges
 but
 nonetheless
 the
 events
 of


of
 October
 of
 last
 year
 the
 war
 in
 Gaza


this
 is
 a
 this
 has
 been
 a
 very


heartbreaking
 moment
 for
 Humanity
 across


these
 two
 fronts
 so
 um
 Ken
 Griffin
 if


you
 were
 asked
 to
 um
 take
 over
 the


finances
 of
 the
 United
 States
 would
 you


do
 that
 look
 if
 if
 we
 had
 a
 financial


challenge
 in
 America
 and
 I
 could
 be
 of


helped
 to
 this
 country
 of
 course
 I'd
 do


that
 K
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 corer
 culture
 you


you've
 talked
 quite
 a
 bit
 about
 uh


talent
 and
 the
 of
 course
 the
 importance


of
 having
 talent
 and
 so
 on
 how
 much
 time


do
 you
 spend
 on
 recruitment
 so
 I
 am


talking
 to
 candidates
 all
 the


time
 nothing's
 more
 important
 than
 the


talent
 that
 we
 bring
 into
 our
 four
 walls


that
 we
 develop
 within
 our
 four
 walls


and
 that
 leads
 this
 firm
 both
 in
 the


deployment
 of
 capital
 and
 the
 building


of
 businesses
 and
 you
 have
 like
 a
 you


have
 like
 a
 wall
 of
 applications
 right
 I


mean
 I
 thought
 you
 know
 we
 have
 like


1,500
 applications
 for
 like
 three


positions
 now
 in
 New
 York
 but
 you
 got


like
 100,000
 applications
 we
 do
 we
 have


about
 a
 100,000
 applicants
 from
 colleges


and
 universities
 around
 the
 world
 wow


and
 let
 me
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 what
 makes
 me


smile
 the
 most
 about
 that
 everybody


around
 the
 world
 knows
 that
 we
 work
 5


days
 a
 week
 in
 an


office
 this
 tells
 you
 that
 there
 are
 an


enormous
 number
 of
 of
 young
 adults


around
 this
 world
 that
 want
 to
 be
 in
 an


environment
 which
 will
 be
 a
 washing


mentorship
 a
 washing
 leadership


development
 where
 they're
 going
 to
 have


careers
 like
 that
 makes
 me
 very


optimistic
 about
 the
 future
 and
 I
 hope


that
 those
 of
 us
 who
 run
 businesses


around
 the
 world
 meet
 these
 students
 in


the
 middle
 and
 give
 them
 that
 experience


that
 will
 let
 them
 have
 great
 careers
 so


now
 I'm
 one
 of
 the
 100,000
 people
 I


managed
 to
 get
 an
 interview
 with
 you
 I'm


of
 course
 uh
 a
 bit
 nervous
 but
 uh


because
 uh
 you
 know
 you're
 a
 very
 famous


person
 but
 uh
 what
 what
 would
 you
 ask
 me


what
 would
 I
 ask
 you
 so
 I'm
 not
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 the
 fourth
 person
 to
 meet


you
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 a
 really
 great


set
 of
 questions
 to
 pose
 to
 you
 let
 me


tell
 you
 what
 I
 look
 for
 I
 look
 for


ambition
 I
 want
 people
 at
 Citadel
 who


really
 want
 to
 change
 the
 world
 of


Finance
 they
 want
 to
 have
 a
 life
 that
 is


full
 of
 impact
 they
 want
 to
 make
 a


difference
 in
 this
 world
 I
 look
 for


strong
 communication
 skills
 I
 think
 the


ability
 to
 convey
 an
 idea
 is


extraordinarily
 important


no
 matter
 what
 commercial
 undertaking


you
 seek
 in
 life
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 able


to
 express
 an
 idea
 we're
 always
 trying


to
 debate
 within
 our
 four
 walls
 the


merits
 of
 our
 ideas
 to
 get
 to
 the
 truth


so
 I
 look
 for
 ambition
 I
 look
 for


communication
 skills
 I
 look
 for
 an


ability
 to
 to
 reason
 and
 to
 rationalize


across
 a
 broad
 array
 of
 problems
 like
 I


want
 people
 who
 are
 really
 good
 thinkers


because
 problem
 solving
 is
 so
 inherent


in
 what
 we
 do
 in
 our
 work
 day
 in
 and
 day


out
 and
 people
 who
 are
 good
 problem


solvers
 are
 people
 who
 Prosper
 here
 at


Citadel
 can
 you
 see
 any
 of
 this
 from
 the


CV
 or
 do
 you
 need
 to
 meet
 people
 oh
 you


need
 to
 meet
 people
 I
 mean
 let's
 be


clear
 people
 know
 how
 to
 write
 CVS


today
 to
 hit
 the
 sweet
 spot
 of
 the


employer
 they're
 seeking
 an
 employment


at
 how
 do
 you
 find
 out
 whether
 I'm
 a


good
 Problem
 Solver
 well
 what
 problems


have
 you
 solved
 and
 every
 every
 student


is
 going
 to
 have
 stories
 of
 how
 they've


solved
 problems
 whether
 it's
 the
 whether


it's
 the
 laundry
 service
 they
 launched


or
 whether
 it's
 a
 a
 prior
 summer
 job


they
 had
 whether
 it's
 a
 thesis
 they


wrote
 there's
 there's
 just
 a
 Litany
 of


opportunities
 for
 students
 to


demonstrate
 that
 they're
 really
 good


problem
 solvers
 what's
 the
 most


difficult
 problem
 you
 have
 solved
 H
 well


the
 most
 difficult
 problems
 have
 yet
 to


be


solved
 but
 what
 is
 that
 uh
 you
 know


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 that


gets
 it's
 done
 a
 multi-period


optimization
 that's
 tough
 to
 solve


multi-period
 optimization
 is
 I
 have
 a


view
 as
 to
 how
 a
 stock
 is
 going
 to
 move


over
 the
 next
 day
 over
 the
 next
 week


over
 the
 next
 month
 over
 the
 next
 year


how
 do
 I
 create
 the
 optimal
 portfolio
 at


this
 moment
 giving
 these
 different
 views


I
 may
 have
 with
 respect
 to
 time
 and
 this


comes
 into
 play
 in
 in
 just
 a
 variety
 of


ways
 in
 which
 we
 have
 to
 to
 make
 Capital


deployment
 decisions
 so
 that's
 a
 that's


an
 interesting
 fast
 a
 problem
 that
 we've


yet
 to
 really
 fully
 solve
 here
 at


Citadel
 very


interesting
 um
 now
 I
 read
 somewhere
 that


you
 said
 that
 um
 if
 you
 wired
 to
 enjoy


being
 a
 good
 competitor
 you
 love
 working


here
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 look
 we
 we're


we're
 Shameless
 we
 want
 to
 hire
 people


who
 really
 enjoy
 winning
 and
 the


financial
 markets
 give
 you
 a
 scorecard


each
 and
 every
 day
 as
 to
 how
 you're


doing
 as
 a


competitor
 and
 what
 we
 find
 is
 that


people
 that
 that
 that
 like
 to
 compete


that
 like
 to
 win


love
 being
 here
 because
 they
 like
 to
 see


the
 real-time
 feedback
 that
 goes
 with


being
 at
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 leading


financial
 institutions
 and
 seeing
 the


success
 of
 their
 research
 bear
 fruit
 in


the
 portfolios
 that
 they
 build
 and


construct
 when
 you
 look
 at
 leadership


what
 is
 good
 leadership
 for
 you
 look


great
 leadership
 comes
 down
 to
 dealing


with
 the
 realities
 of
 the
 situation
 at


hand
 like
 great
 leaders
 are
 just
 very


matter
 of
 fact
 about
 the
 problems
 issues


and
 opportunities
 that
 they
 face
 and
 the


decision
 making
 that
 they
 make
 around


the
 problems
 the
 opportunities
 and
 the


challenges
 that
 they
 face
 like
 they're


they're
 just
 very
 centered
 in
 the


reality
 of
 a
 situation
 they
 don't
 suffer


from
 Sun
 cost
 fallacy
 they
 don't
 suffer


from
 undo
 hope
 when
 a
 situation
 is
 not


hopeful
 they
 make
 good
 rational


decisions
 all
 the
 time
 do


you
 uh
 most
 of
 the
 time
 you
 ask
 what


great
 leadership
 looks
 like
 you
 know


absolutely
 how
 how
 important
 is
 speed
 is


in
 decision
 making
 um
 speeds
 there


there's
 an
 element
 you
 know
 in
 one
 axis


there's
 accuracy
 the
 other
 axis
 is
 speed


what's
 important
 to
 understand
 at
 any


point
 in
 time
 is
 what's
 the
 trade-off


between
 the
 two
 axises
 that
 you
 want
 to


be
 on
 sometimes
 it's
 more
 important
 to


be
 nearly
 right
 and
 quick
 than
 it
 is
 to


be
 absolutely
 right
 and
 slow
 you
 know
 if


you
 think
 about
 it
 you
 want
 to
 think


about
 the
 cost
 of
 changing
 your
 mind
 as


a
 key
 determinant
 of
 how
 fast
 you
 want


to
 be
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 if
 you're
 going


to
 make
 an
 investment
 in
 a
 real
 estate


development
 project
 that's
 going
 to
 take


40
 years
 to
 play
 out
 you
 don't
 need
 to


be
 quick
 you
 need
 to
 be
 thorough
 because


once
 you
 start
 that
 Journey
 that's
 a


very
 long
 journey
 to
 be
 on
 whereas
 if


you
 buy
 $500
 million
 of
 apple
 and
 you


rise
 the
 next
 day
 that
 you
 missed
 a


Salient
 fact
 you
 can
 move
 quickly
 to
 get


back
 out
 of
 that
 trade


how
 do
 you
 balance
 um
 analysis
 with


gutfield


so
 gutfield


the
 best
 gutfield
 is
 actually
 almost


like
 subconscious
 analysis
 yeah
 all


right
 so
 when
 people
 tell
 me
 like
 just


in
 my
 gut
 I
 believe
 X
 I'm
 trying
 to


think
 about
 is
 that
 their
 subconscious


playing
 out
 they've
 had
 many
 at
 bats
 in


this
 kind
 of
 problem
 they
 they
 know


roughly
 what
 the
 answer
 is
 they
 haven't


put
 it
 down
 on
 paper
 yet
 but
 their
 guts


really
 more
 of
 a
 reflection
 of
 an


intrinsic
 ability
 to
 analyze
 a
 problem


and
 tell
 you
 what
 to
 do
 some
 people's


gut
 feel
 just
 seems
 to
 be
 you
 know
 what


coffee
 did
 they
 have
 that
 morning
 and
 I


should
 be
 long
 you
 know
 S&S
 because
 like


it
 was
 a
 good
 day
 for
 coffee
 that


doesn't
 work
 here
 at
 Citadel
 gutfield


Citadel
 is
 people
 whose
 gut
 really
 is
 a


reflection
 of
 the
 analyst
 analysis


taking
 place
 in
 their
 minds
 that
 may
 be


not
 fully
 formed
 or
 fully
 manifested
 yet


what
 would
 happen
 to
 citel
 if
 you
 step


down
 that's
 a
 great
 question
 and
 and
 the


good
 news
 is
 I've
 got
 a
 number
 of
 people


here
 who
 would
 very
 successfully
 run
 the


business
 without
 me
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want


to
 step
 down
 I
 enjoy
 my
 job
 I
 love
 the


people
 I
 work
 with
 this
 really
 is
 a


passion
 for
 me
 in
 life
 so
 I
 i'
 like
 to


not
 cross
 that
 bridge
 but
 God
 forbid
 if


I
 had
 to
 I've
 got
 great
 Partners
 who'd


run
 this
 firm
 if
 I
 had
 to
 step
 down
 now


if
 you
 if
 you
 step
 if
 you
 had
 to
 go
 back


to
 University
 what
 would
 you
 study


wow
 so
 like
 20
 years
 old
 again
 or
 am
 I


at
 this
 age
 in
 life
 no
 no
 you
 are
 you


are
 the
 age
 you
 are
 I'd
 probably
 go
 back


to
 University
 and
 study
 a
 bit
 more
 in
 in


the
 realm
 of
 philosophy
 and


government
 those
 have
 been
 problems
 that


have
 always
 interested
 me
 good


governance
 is
 important
 and
 having
 a


solid
 underpinning
 philosophy
 I
 think


helps
 to
 better
 policy


decisions
 I'd
 probably
 also
 take
 a
 bit


of
 time
 to
 study
 mathematics
 and


computer
 science
 and
 understand
 the


state-of-the-art
 today
 better
 it's
 been


a
 long
 time
 since
 I
 was
 in
 a
 class


classroom
 studying
 mathematics
 or


computer
 science
 it'd
 be
 interesting
 to


see
 where's
 the
 world
 today
 in
 those


fields
 what
 are
 you
 the
 most
 curious


about
 just
 know
 I
 would
 say
 my
 curiosity


ranges
 from
 Innovations
 in
 in


biotechnology
 to
 computer
 science
 so


stem
 is
 is
 my
 area
 of
 curiosity
 I'm
 I'm


really
 interested
 in
 the
 developments


that
 are
 taking
 place
 in
 stem
 around
 the


world
 from
 nuclear
 fision
 nuclear
 fusion


microprocessors
 to
 to
 genetic


I
 I'd
 say
 I
 have
 a
 just
 a
 insatiable


thirst
 to
 understand
 more
 about
 problems


and
 developments
 and
 Fields
 as
 as
 broad


as
 that
 and
 when
 you
 don't
 spend
 time
 on


that
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 I
 mean


I
 can
 see
 out
 of
 the
 window
 here
 you're


in
 Miami
 sun
 is


shining
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 do
 outside
 office


so
 I
 I
 I
 love
 to
 bike
 we've
 got
 great


biking
 here
 in
 Miami
 and
 I'm
 very


fortunate
 I
 have
 three
 young
 kids
 who


are
 all
 roughly
 teenagers
 so
 most
 of
 the


time
 most
 time
 when
 I'm
 not
 at
 work
 I'm


I'm
 having
 three
 kids
 basically
 um


basically
 consuming
 all
 my
 free
 time
 and


talking
 of
 um
 young
 people
 we
 have


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 young
 people


um
 listening
 to
 this
 what
 is
 your
 advice


to
 young
 people
 now
 you
 know
 my
 my


advice
 hasn't
 changed
 much
 over
 over


three


decades
 pursue
 what
 you're
 passionate


about
 to
 really
 exell
 something
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 passionate
 about
 the


work
 if
 you're
 not
 passionate
 you're
 not


going
 to
 be
 great
 at
 it
 you're
 not
 going


to
 be
 satisfied
 with
 your
 career
 you


need
 to
 pursue
 areas
 that
 really
 just


you
 wake
 up
 and
 you
 want
 to
 go
 do
 X
 it


might
 be
 being
 a
 doctor
 it
 might
 be


being
 a
 lawyer
 it
 might
 be
 picking


stocks
 but
 you've
 got
 to
 find
 like
 what


wakes
 what
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning


and
 want
 to
 do
 what's
 this
 intrinsically


motivating
 to
 you
 if
 you're
 driven
 by


extrinsic
 motivation
 you
 will
 find
 life


to
 be
 very
 shallow
 you
 need
 to
 find


what's
 your
 intrinsic
 calling
 in
 life


remember
 there
 was
 a
 a
 young
 woman
 here


this
 is
 almost
 30
 years
 ago
 she
 was
 so


talented
 on
 the
 investment
 team
 and
 she


was
 with
 us
 for
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half


two
 years
 and
 her
 and
 her
 her
 manager


walked
 in
 and
 said
 she's
 thinking
 of


going
 to
 medical
 school
 and
 I
 need
 you


to
 convince
 her
 to
 stay
 here
 at


Citadel
 I
 said
 well
 here's
 the
 problem


the
 minute
 she
 walks
 in
 my
 office
 I'm


going
 to
 offer
 to
 write
 her
 a
 letter
 of


recommendation
 the
 world
 desperately


needs
 another
 great
 doctor
 and
 if
 that's


what
 she
 wants
 to
 be
 I
 want
 to
 help
 her


make
 her
 dream
 come
 true
 well
 that's
 a
 a


very
 nice
 place
 to
 end
 it
 for
 sure
 seems


like
 you
 have
 um
 managed
 to
 get
 your


dreams
 to
 come
 through
 uh
 and
 that
 you


are
 on
 your
 way
 to
 make
 Citadel
 the
 most


successful
 investment
 firm
 of
 all
 time


so
 I
 just
 have
 to
 really
 congratulate


you
 and
 uh
 big
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 on


here
 today
 you
 are
 most
 welcome
 thank


you
 so
 much
