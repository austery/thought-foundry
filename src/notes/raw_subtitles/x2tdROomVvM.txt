[Applause]


[Music]


now
 I
 I
 can't
 quite
 hear


you


conversation
 there
 you
 can
 hear
 me
 now


now
 I
 can
 yeah
 all
 right
 but
 here
 it's


super
 safe
 so
 uh
 no


problem
 was
 great
 I
 loved
 it
 I
 love
 the


opening
 I
 loved
 the
 video
 yeah
 same
 here


we
 have
 fantastic
 people
 here
 and
 uh


yeah
 it
 takes
 a
 toll
 on
 them
 once
 in
 a


while
 you
 know
 yeah
 so
 um
 psychological


safety
 why
 do
 we
 need
 it
 as
 investors


and
 what
 does
 it
 look
 like
 well
 I
 I


think
 you
 need
 psychological
 safety
 as


investors
 because
 your
 success
 depends


on
 your
 ability
 to
 make
 high
 quality


bets
 now
 you
 might
 not
 like
 the
 word


bets
 you
 might
 prefer
 decisions
 or


Investments
 but
 make
 no
 mistake
 they


bets
 right
 there
 there's
 uncertainty
 in


in
 in
 in
 that
 way
 um
 and
 those
 are


absolutely
 dependent
 on
 high
 quality


conversations
 and
 high
 quality


conversations
 are
 dependent
 on


psychological
 safety
 they
 require
 that


people
 lean
 in
 and
 say
 the
 uncomfortable


truths
 when
 they
 they
 raise
 an
 idea
 they


raise
 a
 concern
 they
 raise
 a
 dissenting


View
 and
 the
 conversation
 includes
 sort


of
 questions
 and
 answers
 and
 and
 and


makes
 thoughtful
 progress
 toward
 an


uncertain
 resolution
 but
 one
 that
 people


feel
 is
 is
 high
 enough
 quality
 to
 go


forward
 right
 so
 what
 does
 it
 look
 like


it
 looks
 like
 a
 sense
 of
 permission
 for


cander
 it
 does
 not
 look
 comfortable
 you


know
 in
 fact
 it
 it
 probably
 looks
 a


little
 uncomfortable
 because
 it's
 not


natural
 and
 normal
 to
 sort
 of
 to
 lean
 in


with
 the
 thoughts
 you
 have
 that
 you're


not
 absolutely
 sure
 are
 right
 or


helpful
 yeah
 so
 so
 the
 obvious
 question


is
 also
 when
 it
 becomes
 kind
 of
 um


unsafe
 it
 it
 becomes
 unsafe
 once
 in
 a


while
 anytime
 but
 when
 it
 becomes
 like


chronically
 unsafe
 what
 what
 do
 we
 do


any
 advice
 to
 the
 audience
 ah
 yeah
 I


mean
 because
 when
 it
 becomes
 chronically


unsafe
 what
 what
 you
 end
 up
 with
 which


by
 the
 way
 is
 invisible
 and
 I
 think


that's
 really
 important
 you
 know
 to


recognize
 the
 the
 asymmetry
 um
 here


because
 you
 can
 hear
 when
 people
 speak


up
 you
 cannot
 hear
 when
 they
 hold
 back


you
 just
 don't
 know
 that
 there
 actually


is
 something
 in
 their
 heads
 that
 they're


not
 sharing
 so
 so
 in
 a
 sense
 as
 a
 leader


you
 have
 to
 assume
 that
 it
 may
 be


happening
 and
 that
 that
 it
 may
 put
 you


at
 risk
 and
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 work


at
 risk
 so
 I
 think
 what
 the
 the
 place
 to


start
 is
 just
 and
 it
 may
 seem
 you
 know


old
 or
 redundant
 but
 keep
 reminding


people
 of
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 work
 you're


doing
 that
 the
 work
 you're


doing
 necessarily
 includes
 uncertainty


right
 it
 necessarily
 benefits
 from


diverse
 perspectives
 or
 backgrounds
 that


you
 know
 that
 that
 have
 a
 different


angle
 on
 the
 situation
 um
 and
 so
 it's


it's
 um
 when
 I
 and
 why
 why
 does
 that


matter
 because
 when
 you
 are
 reminding


people
 of
 the
 uncertainty
 and
 what's
 at


stake
 you're
 setting
 a
 kind
 of


intellectual
 rationale
 for
 why
 it


actually
 makes
 sense
 that
 you
 do
 care


about
 their


voice
 so
 it's
 so
 you
 actually
 focus
 on


the
 on
 the
 why
 we
 need
 it
 so
 the
 the


drivers
 not
 so
 talking
 too
 much
 about


psychological
 safety
 might
 have
 backfire


a
 bit
 no
 no
 in
 fact
 some
 ways
 if
 if
 I


had
 my
 brothers
 I'd
 recommend
 don't
 talk


about
 it
 at
 all
 it
 just
 talk
 about
 what


does
 a
 high
 quality
 conversation
 look


like
 how
 Does
 it
 include
 people
 you
 know


really
 taking
 those
 risks
 to
 share
 their


thoughts
 and
 being
 willing
 to
 listen


intently
 in
 the
 moments
 when
 they're
 not


speaking
 right
 so
 that
 together
 we
 are


making
 progress
 toward
 the
 best
 possible


decision
 we
 can


make
 all
 right
 so
 so
 this
 psychological


safety
 goes
 a
 bit
 up
 and
 down
 so
 it


fluctuates
 a
 bit
 so
 but
 how
 vulnerable


is
 it
 really
 from
 your
 perspective
 maybe


that's
 a
 bit
 too
 Global
 question
 yeah


I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 the


problem
 is
 that
 it's
 it's
 actually
 quite


ve
 vulnerable
 um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 there's


two


asymmetries
 uh
 that
 that
 that
 people


need
 to
 internalize
 uh
 and
 sort
 of


intellectually
 and
 maybe
 emotionally
 as


well
 and
 one
 is
 what
 I
 call
 the
 risk


reward
 calculus
 right
 and
 that's
 the
 if


I
 mean
 imagine
 a
 moment
 where
 you
 are


weighing
 maybe
 not
 entirely
 consciously


but
 you're
 you're
 you're
 weighing


whether
 or
 not
 to
 speak
 up
 about


something
 to
 share
 a
 thought
 a
 view
 and


in
 that


moment
 if
 you
 were
 to
 speak
 who
 gains


well
 the
 team
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 um


the
 organization
 if
 you
 will
 how


confident
 are
 you
 that
 your
 voice
 will


produce
 a
 gain
 not
 very
 and
 when
 will


that
 gain
 occur
 well
 sometime
 down
 the


road
 now
 if
 you
 because
 you're
 not
 quite


sure
 stay
 silent
 who
 gains
 you
 do
 right


you
 stay
 you
 stay
 safe
 and
 comfortable


for
 another
 minute
 when
 does
 that
 gain


happen
 immediately
 how
 confident
 are
 you


that
 your
 silence
 won't
 produce
 a
 bad


outcome
 100%
 so
 that's
 a
 pretty
 profound


asymmetry
 you
 know
 when
 you
 think
 about


it
 you
 realize
 that
 leaders
 actually


have
 to
 go
 on
 a
 treasure
 hunt
 because


otherwise
 the
 risk
 reward
 calculus
 will


get
 you
 every
 time
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the


other
 um
 the
 other
 is
 the
 asymmetry


between
 um
 the
 the
 good
 and
 bad


exchanges
 right
 so
 if
 I
 have
 U
 you
 know


and
 maybe
 it
 happens
 rarely
 but
 if
 I


have
 a
 bad
 a
 bad
 reaction
 to
 my
 taking
 a


risk
 and
 speaking
 up
 and
 someone
 is


dismissive
 or
 judgmental
 or
 you
 know


even
 um
 you
 know
 downright
 humiliates
 me


I
 will
 not
 try
 again
 for
 quite
 some
 time


whereas
 if
 I
 have
 a
 good
 response
 it


won't
 sort
 of
 preclude
 me
 from
 trying


again
 but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 make
 it


that
 much
 easier
 it
 just
 doesn't
 make
 it


harder
 right
 so
 again
 the
 degree
 to


which
 I'm
 willing
 to
 try
 again
 goes


vastly
 down
 if
 I
 have
 you
 know
 one


humiliating
 moment
 and
 so
 given
 you
 know


given
 those
 those
 sort
 of
 asymmetries


you
 have
 to
 um
 you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 I


guess
 I
 guess
 I'm
 just
 answering
 your


question
 wholeheartedly
 which
 is
 you
 are


vulnerable
 yeah
 makes
 sense
 I
 think
 I


think
 we
 all
 can
 relate
 to
 that
 as
 well


so
 so
 one
 misunderstanding
 or


uh
 or
 what
 what
 we
 ended
 up
 uh
 realizing


sometimes
 is
 that
 people
 when
 we
 talk
 a


bit
 about
 psychological
 safety
 we
 have


to
 open
 the
 box
 a
 bit
 and
 then
 we
 talk


about
 it
 and
 then
 people
 may
 be
 missed


the
 point
 so
 they're
 trying
 to
 make
 it


comfortable
 but
 for
 no
 particular
 reason


performance-
 wise
 so
 like
 you
 get
 points


for
 making
 it
 safe
 but
 like
 you
 forget


to
 to
 draw
 the
 link
 between
 that
 what's


what's
 your
 advice
 for
 those


misunderstandings
 yeah
 yeah
 I
 mean
 I


think
 my
 my
 Dev
 is
 again
 to
 to
 not
 again


but
 to
 come
 to
 come
 to
 that
 um
 constant


sort
 of
 appreciation
 of
 the
 knowledge


intensive
 really
 intellectual
 work
 that


you
 do
 um
 you
 know
 and
 that's
 that's


different
 from
 say
 high-risk
 work
 in
 a


you
 know
 in
 a
 a
 power
 plant
 or
 an


aluminum
 plant
 or
 something
 like
 that


but
 there
 is
 some
 there
 are
 some
 ways
 in


which
 you
 have
 it
 in
 common
 which
 is


that
 both
 require
 a
 sense
 of
 of
 of


vigilance
 of
 very
 um


thoughtful
 conscious
 inter
 relationships


with
 others
 I'm
 interrelating
 meaning
 I


want
 to
 listen
 to
 you
 closely
 I
 want
 you


to
 listen
 to
 me
 closely
 we
 want
 people


to
 be
 paying
 attention
 um
 and
 doesn't


mean
 you
 have
 to
 be
 you
 know
 completely


on
 all
 the
 time
 there
 are
 breaks
 of


course
 and
 there
 are
 you
 know
 we
 we
 want


people
 to
 you
 know
 leave
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 go
 for
 a
 run
 whatever
 you
 know


whatever
 works
 for
 you
 but
 but
 that
 that


sense
 of
 awareness
 that
 the
 knowledge


intends
 of
 intellectual
 work
 you
 do


requires
 a
 kind
 of
 um
 alertness
 and
 an


and
 an
 engagement
 to
 do
 it
 well
 um
 and


you
 know
 what
 what
 allows
 people
 in


high-risk
 Industries
 to
 perform
 well
 and


to
 avoid
 sort
 of
 catastrophic
 accidents


or
 worker
 uh
 accidents
 is
 not
 a
 kind
 of


um
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 blind
 spot
 about


failure
 but
 quite
 the
 opposite
 it's
 like


a
 almost
 a
 preoccupation
 with
 failure


they
 are
 aware
 you
 know
 that
 around


every
 corner
 is
 a
 potentially
 fatal


accident
 and
 because
 of
 that
 they
 sort


of
 bring
 their
 aame
 to
 the
 moment
 to
 the


moments
 that
 need
 it
 and
 all
 I'm


suggesting
 is
 you
 can
 bring
 your
 aame
 to


the
 moments
 that
 need
 it
 and
 it
 it's
 it


requires
 um
 vigilance
 it
 requires
 a


little
 bravery
 you
 know
 and
 it
 requires


just
 kind
 of
 an
 appreciation
 for
 for


what's
 at


stake
 all
 right
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 that


isn't
 it
 interesting


us
 nerding
 about
 you
 know
 on
 the


psychological
 safety
 part
 so
 guess
 what


Amy
 has
 written
 this
 great
 book
 I
 just


finished
 it
 uh
 the
 right
 kind
 of


wrongs
 is
 the
 name
 is
 a
 book
 about


failures
 way
 great
 fun
 what


fun
 so
 so
 you
 separate
 so
 so
 I
 think


sometimes
 having
 a
 language
 around


failures
 and
 doing
 things
 wrong
 is
 like


uh
 digging
 or
 have
 some
 more
 Precision


to
 it
 and
 you
 you
 have
 an
 interestes
 um


separation
 between
 basic
 complex
 and


intelligent
 failures
 can
 you
 clarify
 a


bit
 sure
 sure
 so
 a
 basic
 failure
 is
 a


failure
 that
 occurs
 in
 familiar


territory
 usually
 because
 of
 human
 error


just
 a


single
 dumb
 mistake
 leads
 to
 a
 basic


failure
 for
 instance
 in
 2021
 a
 City
 Bank


employee
 accidentally
 checked
 the
 wrong


box
 in
 an
 online
 form
 and
 accidentally


transferred
 $900
 million
 to
 a
 group
 of


lenders
 right
 and
 then
 later
 a
 judge
 uh


made
 a
 controversial
 ruling
 that
 did
 not


allow
 City
 Bank
 to
 reclaim
 those
 funds


right
 so
 it
 was
 a
 single
 human
 error


maybe
 not
 paying
 attention
 maybe
 not


well
 trained
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 led
 to
 a


failure
 that
 we
 would
 all
 consider


fairly
 sizable
 that
 was
 nonetheless


basic
 so
 basic
 doesn't
 mean
 small
 or
 big


you
 know
 it's
 a
 basic
 failure
 when
 you


forget
 to
 charge
 your
 phone
 and
 you
 know


Miss
 a
 meeting
 whatever
 but
 some
 of
 them


are
 big
 some
 of
 them
 are
 small
 basic


complex
 failures
 are
 ones
 with
 um
 the


perfect
 storms
 they're
 the
 they're
 the


failures
 that
 inevitably
 happen


in
 you
 know
 relatively
 familiar


territory
 when
 a
 handful
 of
 small


deviations
 from
 best
 practice
 come


together
 in
 just
 the
 wrong
 way
 to
 create


a
 failure
 a
 supply
 chain
 breakdown
 in
 a


global
 pandemic
 for
 instance
 again
 basic


failures
 can
 be
 I
 mean
 complex
 failures


can
 be
 small
 or
 large
 but
 there
 the
 what


makes
 what's
 different
 is
 that
 any
 one


of
 those
 factors
 on
 its
 own
 those
 small


deviations
 wouldn't
 produce
 a
 failure
 it


it
 was
 The
 Perfect
 Storm
 the
 way
 they


came
 together
 neither
 basic
 nor
 complex


failures
 are
 worthy
 of
 Celebration
 right


they're
 not
 useful
 like
 when
 we're
 at


our
 best
 we
 can
 prevent
 them
 I
 mean
 some


of
 them
 will
 slip
 through
 I
 understand


that
 and
 that's
 okay
 we're
 human
 but


when
 we're
 at
 our
 best
 we
 don't
 need
 to


have
 those
 they
 they
 bring
 us
 learning


but
 not
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 new
 learning
 in


contrast
 what
 I
 call
 intelligent


failures
 are
 those
 that
 uh
 explicitly


occur
 in
 New
 Territory
 they
 are
 the


undesired
 results
 of
 thoughtful


experiments
 so
 a
 failure
 for
 a
 failure


to
 be
 intelligent
 um
 we
 must
 not
 yet


have
 the
 knowledge
 we
 need
 to
 get
 the


result
 we
 want
 so
 it's
 new
 territory


much
 of
 your
 work
 is
 in
 New
 Territory
 by


definition
 yeah
 it's
 in
 pursuit
 of
 a


goal
 whether
 that's
 making
 money
 or
 you


know
 mastering
 a
 a
 skill
 or
 making
 a


scientific
 discovery
 you
 have
 a
 goal


number
 three
 it
 is
 um
 hypothesis
 driven


you've
 you've
 you've
 taken
 the
 time
 to


figure
 out
 what
 we
 know
 what
 we
 don't


know
 and
 you've
 made
 a
 good
 bet
 and
 then


finally
 for
 a
 failure
 to
 be
 intelligent


it
 should
 not
 be
 any
 larger
 than


necessary
 to
 get
 the
 new
 knowledge
 right


so
 this
 is
 what
 scient
 do
 every
 day
 uh


but
 I
 would
 argue
 in
 your
 business
 you


are
 doing
 this
 uh
 as
 well
 athletes
 also


do
 this
 yeah
 trying
 to
 yeah
 trying
 to


get
 into
 new
 territory
 uh
 you're


stretching
 and
 it
 doesn't
 always
 work


yeah
 so
 uh
 new
 territory
 we
 need
 to
 take


risk
 and
 we
 should
 celebrate
 it
 because


we
 don't
 know
 it's
 hard
 to
 yeah
 you
 have


to
 train
 yourself
 to
 say
 Okay
 that
 was


disappointing
 and
 it's
 still
 valuable


right
 it
 brings
 us
 something
 we
 did
 not


know
 before
 yeah
 and
 all
 territory
 so
 we


we're
 all
 human
 beings
 we
 had
 some
 erors


small
 today
 you
 know
 things
 happen
 uh
 we


should
 uh
 get
 them
 out
 in
 in
 the
 open
 so


we
 can
 identify
 them
 learn
 from
 them
 and


maybe
 who
 knows
 we
 might
 even
 prevent


them
 next
 time
 but
 uh
 yeah
 exactly
 so


that's
 useful
 just
 uh
 before
 we
 run
 out


of
 time
 here
 um
 Amy
 so
 um
 we
 see
 that
 in


this
 Marathon
 sport


um
 you
 become
 world
 champions
 of
 uh


committing
 mistakes
 or
 doing
 doing


something
 wrong
 and
 yeah
 so
 but
 so
 you


want
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 on
 the
 wins
 right


but
 I
 can
 see
 it
 takes
 a
 toll
 on
 quite
 a


few
 people
 any
 advice
 this
 is
 I
 suppose


this
 is
 my
 job
 but
 uh
 any
 advice
 yeah
 uh


how
 can
 people
 travel
 light
 but
 still


remain
 their
 because
 we're
 long
 term
 we


want
 people
 to


last
 be
 years
 I
 think
 you
 know
 part
 of


it
 is
 having
 a
 a
 more
 you
 know
 training


yourself
 to
 have
 a
 more
 rational


response
 to
 the
 disappointments
 I
 andan


I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 natural
 response


that's
 quite
 emotional
 and
 we
 believe


you
 know
 at
 some
 level
 We
 Believe
 well


that
 shouldn't
 have
 happened
 and
 it's
 it


it
 it
 it
 exhausts
 us
 in
 a
 way
 to
 think


that
 way
 and
 when
 we
 learn
 to
 master
 the


pause
 you
 know
 just
 insert
 that
 space


between
 the
 stimulus
 and
 our
 response
 we


can
 then
 think
 more


rationally
 about
 the
 situation
 okay


that's
 disappointing
 and
 what
 do
 we


learn
 from
 it
 what
 actually
 happened
 and


how
 do
 we
 use
 it
 uh
 to
 go
 forward
 it's
 a


almost
 a
 Relentless
 forward
 F
 Focus
 we


care
 about
 the
 past
 because
 the
 past
 is


full
 of
 learnings
 but
 our


our
 our
 focus
 is
 on
 on
 the
 future
 and


and
 what
 do
 we
 do
 with
 all
 that
 valuable


learning
 that's
 good
 advice
 I
 just


haven't
 off
 the
 burner
 I
 need
 to
 ask
 you


Amy
 uh
 this
 psychological
 safety
 really


strike
 the
 chord
 researchers
 applied
 PR


practitioners
 organizations
 have
 used
 it


to
 become
 better
 where
 are
 the
 herds


going
 in
 social
 sciences
 now
 do
 you


think
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 really


know
 it
 seems
 to
 me
 all
 anyone
 can
 talk


about
 is
 AI
 so
 maybe
 it's
 AI
 nudges
 that


help
 us
 Master
 the
 pause
 that
 help
 us


you
 know
 sort
 of
 be
 brave
 uh
 be
 more


rational


I
 don't
 know
 but
 um
 we'll
 we'll
 have
 to


just
 wait
 and
 see
 this
 was
 great
 Amy


thanks
 for
 joining
 us
 bye
 thanks
 for


having
 me
 thank
 you
