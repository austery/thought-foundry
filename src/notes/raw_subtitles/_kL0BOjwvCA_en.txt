>> Uh,
 speaking
 of
 technology,
 uh,
 piece
 of


news
 out
 I
 thought
 was
 really


interesting,
 Scarlet.
 Microsoft
 saying,


"Hey,
 we're
 not
 going to
 have
 as
 much
 u


I
 guess
 uh
 data
 center
 capacity
 as
 we


thought
 and
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 as


much
 as
 we
 need
 until
 maybe
 sometime


next
 year."
 It's
 just
 another
 data
 point


that
 as
 Jay
 was
 just
 pointing
 out,


there's
 lots
 of
 ways
 to
 play
 AI.
 Money's


being
 spent
 all
 throughout


>> the
 economy,
 not
 just
 the
 tech
 stack,


>> but
 there's
 still
 log
 jams
 nonetheless.


>> Yeah,
 still
 log
 jams
 nonetheless.
 So,


let's
 see
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 our
 good


friends
 at
 Microsoft.
 Honor
 Rana
 joins


us,
 technology
 analyst
 uh
 for
 Bloomberg


Intelligence.
 Uh
 again,
 what
 do
 you
 make


of
 this
 Microsoft
 news
 honor
 that
 they


say,
 you
 know,
 data
 center
 crunch
 is


going
 to
 persist
 into
 2026?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 Microsoft
 talked
 about
 a


little
 bit
 of
 this
 uh
 in
 the
 earnings


call
 about,
 let's
 say,
 12
 months
 ago.


Then
 they
 said
 things
 are
 easing
 or


things
 are
 improving
 and
 it
 does
 have
 an


impact
 on
 their
 cloud
 business
 growth


rate
 when
 things
 are
 tight.
 Now
 this


news
 I
 think
 it
 was
 an
 excellent
 article


written
 by
 Bloomberg
 News
 and
 you
 know


it
 gives
 us
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 to
 think


about
 as
 to
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 over


the
 next
 12
 to
 18
 months.
 We
 think
 capex


could
 go
 up.
 We
 think
 cloud
 realization


of
 the
 rates
 could
 go
 down
 and
 uh
 you


know
 the
 AI
 boom
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 or


the
 AI
 infrastructure
 boom
 is
 going
 to


continue
 because
 if
 Microsoft
 needs
 more


capacity
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 people
 like


Cororeweave,
 Nebas,
 Oracle.
 they're


going
 to
 go
 to
 their
 uh
 you
 know


companies
 that
 they
 work
 with
 to
 create


the
 data
 centers
 and
 the
 you
 know
 the


downstream
 effect
 of
 that.
 So
 positive


news
 for
 the
 AI
 infrastructure
 space
 but


maybe
 has
 an
 impact
 on
 Microsoft's
 cloud


growth
 rate.


>> Does
 it
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 Microsoft


spending
 as
 well
 and
 how
 will
 that
 show


up
 in
 the
 earnings
 when
 the
 company


reports?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 can
 have
 an
 impact
 on


their
 gross
 margins.
 You
 you
 may
 see
 a


tick
 down.
 um
 they
 they
 have
 said
 that


you
 know
 that
 the
 next
 financial
 years


the
 next
 fiscal
 year
 they're
 going
 to


spend
 more
 on
 capex
 than
 last
 year
 but


the
 rate
 of
 growth
 is
 going
 to
 go
 down.


Now
 they
 haven't
 given
 any
 figure
 so
 you


can
 drive
 a
 big
 truck
 in
 that
 particular


range
 uh
 because
 they
 are
 giving


themselves
 the
 flexibility
 to
 say
 that


one
 could
 argue
 that
 the
 year
 after
 that


now
 they're
 you
 know
 maybe
 they're
 going


to
 spend
 even
 more
 so
 that
 really
 you


know
 has
 an
 impact
 on
 the
 entire
 cycle.


So
 that
 means
 Oracle
 has
 to
 spend
 more.


That
 means
 Meta
 has
 to
 spend
 more.


Amazon
 has
 to
 spend
 more
 and
 u
 that
 that


you
 know
 continues
 this
 big
 boom
 of
 all


the
 downstream
 companies
 we
 have


anything
 from
 chips
 to
 um
 you
 know
 data


center
 cooling
 and
 water
 etc.


>> What
 inning
 honor
 do
 you
 think
 we
 are
 in


this
 AI
 tech
 buildout?


I
 think
 we're
 in
 a
 fairly
 early
 innings


because
 unlike
 software
 coding
 or
 you


could
 say,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 buildout
 of


a
 new
 e-commerce
 website,
 this
 one's


going
 to
 take
 some
 time
 because
 every


data
 center
 takes
 a
 long
 time
 to
 come


up.
 I
 mean,
 from
 breaking
 ground,


getting
 permits
 to
 getting
 power
 to


actually
 building
 it,
 then
 putting
 it


together.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 it
 takes
 a
 few


years
 for
 that
 to
 build
 out.
 So,
 I
 I
 do


not
 see
 any
 reason
 why
 in
 five
 to
 seven


years
 we'll
 still
 not
 be
 talking
 about


this
 topic.


you
 know,
 when
 we
 come
 back
 to
 this
 data


center
 crunch
 for
 Microsoft,
 is
 this
 a


zero-
 sum
 game
 where
 it's
 Microsoft's


loss
 for
 now
 in
 the
 short
 term
 as
 it


builds
 these
 things
 out
 uh
 and
 its


competitors
 gain?
 And
 if
 so,
 what
 are


the
 names
 that
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 uh
 most


able
 to
 benefit?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 anybody's
 gain
 in


this
 point.
 So,
 the
 crunch
 that
 they
 are


having,
 I
 bet
 the
 same
 thing
 is


happening
 with
 Google,
 same
 thing
 is


happening
 with
 Meta
 and
 Amazon.
 they
 are


all
 going
 out
 to
 these
 third
 party


neocloud
 providers
 to
 see
 wherever
 they


can
 find
 capacity
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 whoever
 has
 any
 capacity
 left
 you


know
 they
 will
 find
 a
 customer
 from
 one


of
 these
 large
 vendors
 uh
 because
 what


not
 only
 what
 they're
 doing
 is
 selling


products
 to
 the
 third
 parties
 outside


their
 internal
 processes
 they
 are


actually
 improving
 it
 as
 well
 somebody


like
 a
 meta
 they
 really
 are
 improving


their
 ads
 ad
 business
 because
 of
 AI
 and


they
 they
 need
 more
 capacity
 because
 of


that
 as


earnings
 uh
 will
 be
 kicking
 off
 the


season
 uh
 next
 week
 for
 the
 banks
 and


then
 we'll
 get
 the
 tech
 companies
 a


little
 bit
 later.
 What
 are
 you
 going
 to


be
 listening
 for
 uh
 honor
 during
 this


earning
 cycle
 for
 your
 tech
 names?


>> It's
 a
 big
 tale
 of
 two
 cities.
 One
 side


we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 actual
 drop
 in


discretionary
 spending.
 So
 any
 of
 the


consulting
 names
 that
 they're
 not
 going


to
 have
 a
 good
 time.
 any
 of
 the


traditional
 software
 names,
 even
 SAS


names,
 uh
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a


good
 time
 because
 subscription
 growth
 is


going
 to
 slow
 down.
 Um
 but
 on
 the
 other


side,
 you
 know,
 somebody
 like
 a


codeweave
 or
 an
 Oracle
 or
 a
 Microsoft,


uh
 they
 will
 talk
 about
 more
 bookings.


Oracle
 is
 not
 going
 to
 report
 in
 the
 in


this
 particular
 earning
 season,
 but
 a


month
 after
 that,
 I
 think
 they
 will
 all


see
 a
 good
 increase
 in
 the
 backlog
 or


the
 order
 book.
 Uh
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 the


space,
 I
 think,
 is
 going
 to
 struggle.


Once
 upon
 a
 time
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 the


companies
 benefited
 from
 uh
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 rush
 to
 use
 up
 the
 IT
 budget.


Um
 you
 know
 every
 company
 had
 a
 certain


amount
 of
 money
 allotted
 to
 spending
 on


it
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 companies
 didn't


get
 around
 to
 using
 it
 until
 the
 fourth


quarter
 and
 then
 they
 would
 do
 so
 in
 a


big
 rush.
 Do
 you
 see
 that
 happening
 this


time
 around?


>> Yes,
 it
 would
 happen
 but
 only
 happen
 on


the
 AI
 side
 of
 things.
 The
 non
 AI
 uh


side
 of
 the
 tech
 spending
 I
 think
 that's


still
 going
 to
 struggle.
 We
 we
 may
 not


have
 a
 resolution
 of
 that
 till
 the


global
 macro
 environment
 improves
 till


we
 have
 a
 resolution
 between
 US
 China


trade
 war
 till
 we
 know
 what's
 happening


to
 interest
 rate.
 I
 think
 that
 part
 of


the
 equation
 is
 going
 to
 struggle.


>> Stay
 with
 us.
 More
 from
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 coming
 up
 after
 this.


>> You're

 the
 Bloomberg

All right,
 let's
 uh
 turn
 now
 to
 a
 sector


that
 of
 course
 is
 affected
 by
 tariffs


directly
 and
 that
 is
 the
 auto
 sector.


Steve
 Man
 is
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence


global
 autos
 and
 industrials
 research


analysts
 and
 he
 joins
 us
 now
 to
 talk


about
 Stellantis.
 Uh
 Stellantis,
 it's
 uh


Chrysler,
 right
 Paul?


>> Jeep,
 Chrysler,
 all
 those
 good
 brands.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 always
 get
 confused
 cuz
 I
 see


Stalantis.
 I'm
 like,
 what
 car
 company
 is


this?
 I
 don't
 get
 it.
 In
 any
 case,
 uh
 it


third
 quarter
 shipments
 climbed
 to
 13%


led
 by
 rise
 in
 North
 America.
 So,
 there


is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 recovery
 here
 after
 the


car
 maker
 uh
 has
 been
 working
 down


inventory
 in
 the
 US.
 Uh
 Steve,
 thanks


for
 joining
 us.
 Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 Stellantis
 and
 how
 sensitive


vulnerable
 it
 is
 to
 uh
 President
 Trump's


tariffs.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 they
 are
 very
 sensitive
 um


to
 to
 tariffs.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


the
 impact
 on
 companies
 like
 Stentes
 and


the
 Detroit
 trio
 is
 really
 their
 uh


operations
 uh
 in
 Mexico
 and
 Canada.
 Uh
 I


think
 Trump
 is
 looking
 for
 them
 to


actually
 move
 some
 of
 those
 production


back
 uh
 into
 the
 US
 and
 employ
 more
 US


workers.
 So
 um
 I
 mean
 there's
 been
 a
 lot


of
 rhetoric
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know


potential
 changes
 uh
 changes
 are
 are
 are


impending.
 Um
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 for
 now
 uh


auto
 tariffs
 it's
 been
 pretty
 quiet
 and


I
 don't
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 Trump


you
 know
 the
 tweets
 are
 is
 going
 to


impact
 the
 the
 Detroit
 3.


>> So
 where
 are
 we
 in
 terms
 of
 implementing


tariffs
 on
 autos
 just
 incoming
 and


outgoing
 in
 the
 US?
 Where
 are
 we?
 Are


they
 actually
 being
 levied
 at
 the


moment?


>> Yeah
 it's
 it's
 happening
 at
 the
 moment.


We've
 heard
 a
 lot
 of
 news
 on,
 you
 know,


companies
 moving
 production
 back
 uh
 to


the
 US.
 Uh
 GM
 have
 moved
 some
 of
 their


Silverado
 uh
 production,
 one
 of
 their


highest
 uh
 profit
 uh
 vehicles
 uh
 you


know
 from
 from
 Canada
 back
 to
 the
 US.
 So


uh
 we're
 hearing
 that
 from
 Ford
 and
 and


some
 other
 uh
 automakers.
 You
 know,


Hyundai
 is
 investing
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 US
 uh


you
 know,
 likely
 to
 move
 some
 of
 the


production
 from
 South
 Korea
 into
 the
 US.


So
 we
 are
 already
 starting
 to
 hear
 and


see
 uh
 the
 the
 effects
 of
 those
 uh
 auto


tariffs.


>> Steve,
 this
 might
 be
 an
 unanswerable


question,
 but
 with
 companies
 making
 the


moves
 to
 do
 that,
 this
 will
 take
 a
 long


time.
 This
 is
 a
 multi-year
 process,


right?
 You
 don't
 just
 decide
 that
 you're


going to
 reshore
 manufacturing,
 it


happens
 the
 next
 day.
 Is
 just
 saying


that
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 that
 enough
 to


appease
 the
 administration?


>> Well,
 it's
 it's
 a
 I
 look
 at
 it
 as
 a


two-phase
 process.
 There's
 what
 what
 I


call
 lowhanging
 fruits.
 So,
 you
 know,


for
 example,
 I
 gave
 earlier
 on
 the
 uh


Chevrolet
 Silverado
 that
 GM
 shifted
 uh


to
 back
 to
 the
 US.
 You
 know,
 if
 they


have
 spare
 capacity
 uh
 in
 the
 US,
 that's


that's
 a
 no-brainer.
 They
 can
 shift
 that


back
 quickly.
 But
 you're
 absolutely


right.
 Um
 you
 know,
 longer
 term,
 it
 it's


going
 to
 take
 years
 to
 kind
 of
 unravel


uh
 the
 the
 North
 American
 supply
 chain


to
 focus
 more
 on
 the
 US.
 It's
 going
 to


take
 years
 because
 uh
 you
 know
 plants


take
 years
 to
 build
 and
 then
 you
 also


have
 to
 bring
 back
 the
 suppliers.
 The


suppliers
 rather
 produce
 their
 parts


near
 the
 manufacturing
 near
 the
 assembly


plants
 uh
 rather
 than
 you
 know
 other
 you


know
 uh
 in
 other
 countries
 where
 you


know
 shipping
 cost
 could
 cost
 could
 be


very
 high.
 So
 it
 it
 could
 take
 u
 if
 not


years
 a
 couple
 of
 decades
 to
 to
 to


actually
 um
 turn
 that
 ship
 around.
 So


where
 is
 Stalantis
 just
 from
 a


positioning
 perspective
 right
 now


relative
 to
 the
 other
 automakers
 out


there?


Yeah,
 Stalantis
 has
 been
 losing
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 market
 share
 on
 their
 high
 you


know
 the
 higher
 profit
 vehicles
 like
 the


Ram
 trucks,
 the
 the
 Jeeps
 and
 you
 know


with
 the
 new
 CEO
 coming
 on
 board
 you


know
 the
 shift
 the
 the
 the
 strategy
 has


shifted
 from
 more
 of
 achieving
 cost


savings
 from
 the
 mergers
 uh
 that
 created


Stantis
 back
 in
 2001
 to
 more
 of
 an


outreach.
 you
 know,
 how
 are
 we
 going
 to


how
 are
 they
 going
 to
 uh
 answer
 the
 the


demands
 of
 of
 the
 consumer?
 They
 really


want
 the
 V8
 back,
 which
 is
 what
 they're


doing.
 They're
 bringing
 that
 V8
 Hemi


back.


>> And,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 they
 also
 bring
 the


midsize
 Jeep
 Cherokee
 back,
 which
 has


been
 very
 popular
 with
 consumers.


>> Stay
 with
 us.
 More
 from
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 coming
 up
 after
 this.

 wherever

>> All right,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 consumer


here.
 How's
 the
 consumer
 doing
 out


there?
 Um,
 there's
 lots
 of
 ways
 you
 can


kind
 of
 get
 a
 sense
 for
 that.
 We
 talked


to
 Mike
 Halen
 from
 Bloomberg


Intelligence
 about
 how
 the
 restaurant


traffic
 is
 doing.
 And
 we
 also
 can
 talk


to
 Lindsay
 Dutch.
 Uh,
 she
 covers
 the


consumer
 hardlines
 uh
 retail
 uh


companies.
 Uh
 she's
 a
 senior
 analyst
 at


Bloomberg
 Intelligence.
 Lindsay,
 let's


talk
 like
 I
 know
 Dick
 Sporting
 Goods,
 uh


Ulta.
 You
 got
 a
 couple
 companies
 that


are
 going
 to
 be
 reporting
 earnings


coming
 up
 and
 what
 do
 you
 expect
 from


these
 companies?


>> Yeah,
 thanks
 Paul
 for
 having
 me.
 Um


we're
 taking
 a
 look
 at
 sort
 of
 fullear


guidance
 going
 into
 the
 third
 quarter


earnings
 and
 of
 course
 that
 important


holiday
 shopping
 season.
 And
 what
 we've


noticed
 is
 you
 know
 the
 guidance
 ranges


are
 very
 very
 wide
 for
 these
 retailers.


It's
 baking
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty


surrounding
 the
 consumer.
 But
 when
 we


look
 at
 the
 demand
 trends
 and
 sort
 of


first
 half
 results,
 first
 half
 results


were
 pretty
 solid
 for
 many
 of
 these


hardline
 retailers.
 And
 we're
 seeing


better
 demand
 in
 the
 beauty
 space.
 You


know,
 better
 demand
 for
 electronics
 even


and
 home
 furnishings,
 some
 categories


that
 have
 really
 been
 struggling.
 And


when
 I
 look
 at
 this
 guidance
 range,
 I


sort
 of
 think
 that
 we
 might
 be
 able
 to


trend
 sort
 of
 towards
 the
 middle
 upper


half
 of
 the
 range
 if
 that
 demand
 can


hang
 on
 through
 the
 second
 half
 into


2026.


>> Can
 that
 demand
 hang
 on
 if
 prices


increase
 or
 the
 supply
 is
 limited?
 Uh


we're
 hearing
 again
 these
 headlines
 from


President
 Trump
 that
 um
 there
 could
 be
 a


massive
 increase
 of
 tariffs
 on
 goods


from
 China.
 Dick
 Sporting
 Goods,
 Ulta


Beauty
 certainly
 uh
 do
 rely
 on
 China
 uh


for
 for
 their
 supply
 chain.
 And
 so
 I'm


curious
 whether
 that
 gets
 folded
 in.


>> So
 I
 think
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


second
 half,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that


inventory
 is
 already
 in
 place.
 Um,
 and


there
 have
 been
 price
 increases
 that


have
 occurred
 on
 that
 inventory.
 We're


expecting
 to
 see
 that.
 Um,
 we
 do
 think


the
 shopper
 is
 going
 to
 come
 out
 a
 lot


like
 they
 did
 last
 year,
 selective,


value
 focused,
 but
 they're
 still
 willing


to
 spend,
 you
 know,
 on
 certain
 things.


And
 and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 the
 key


draw
 there
 is
 you
 know
 anything
 that's


new
 um
 Nintendo
 Switch
 2
 um
 you
 know


anything
 exclusive
 or
 like
 a
 premium


type
 product
 you
 know
 which
 does
 skew
 to


add
 a
 dick
 sporting
 goods.
 I
 think
 when


I
 think
 about
 the
 risk
 you
 know
 of
 these


headlines
 that
 we're
 seeing
 you
 know


Best
 Buy
 you
 know
 is
 responding
 to
 those


headlines
 I
 think
 if
 we
 see
 a
 big
 much


higher
 levy
 on
 goods
 from
 China
 you
 know


that's
 something
 that
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 address
 in
 the
 2026
 year.
 They


have
 significantly
 reduced
 their


exposure.
 You
 know,
 of
 those
 Hardlines


names
 we
 were
 talking
 about,
 Best
 Buy
 is


probably
 the
 most
 exposed,
 33%
 of
 COGS,


but
 it's
 all
 indirect
 exposure.
 So,
 it's


not
 stuff
 that
 they're
 directly


importing.
 It's
 it's
 just
 some
 of
 the


the
 inventory
 that
 they
 have
 on
 hand.


>> Lindsay,
 the
 companies
 you
 cover,
 the


hardline
 retailers,
 what's
 their
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they
 have
 a
 collective
 view
 of


how
 the
 consumer
 is
 doing
 out
 there.


What
 do
 you
 What
 What
 are
 they
 telling


you
 guys?


>> Yeah.
 Again,
 I
 think
 what
 they're
 what


we've
 seen
 and
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 going


back
 all
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 to
 last


year's
 holiday
 season
 is
 that
 newness
 is


driving
 demand
 and
 that's
 no
 matter
 what


the
 category.
 So
 like
 beauty,


electronics,
 we
 saw
 explosive
 demand
 for


that
 Nintendo
 Switch
 2.
 Um
 but
 even
 in


the
 sporting
 um
 goods
 market,
 you
 know,


new
 product
 or
 a
 premium
 type
 product
 is


is
 really
 drawing
 that
 consumer
 in
 even


if
 it's
 a
 higher
 price
 point.
 So


consumers
 are
 definitely
 value
 focused,


but
 they're
 making
 sacrifices.
 They're


choosing
 to
 shop
 value
 on
 certain
 things


and
 then
 they're
 splurging
 on
 other


things.
 It's
 really
 hard
 to
 discern,
 but


like
 I
 said,
 we've
 seen
 improvement


broadly
 in
 the
 home
 furnishings


category.
 um
 also
 in
 electronics
 and


then
 beauty
 which
 kind
 of
 took
 a
 leg


down
 last
 year
 is
 looking
 a
 lot
 better


this
 year.


>> Lindsay,
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 these


companies
 and
 their
 efforts
 to
 make
 sure


that
 the
 consumer
 stays
 with
 them
 no


matter
 what
 happens
 even
 if
 they
 can
 go


to
 say
 TJ
 Maxx
 and
 get
 it
 for
 cheaper


because
 they
 have
 these
 loyalty
 programs


that
 um
 tie
 the
 consumer
 so
 closely
 to


their
 brand
 even
 as
 an
 aggregator.
 Dick


Sporting
 Goods
 does
 not
 sell
 its
 own


branded
 merchandise.
 It
 sells
 Nike.
 It


sells
 New
 Balance.
 But
 people
 go
 back


repeatedly
 to
 the
 store,


>> right?
 Yeah.
 Those
 loyalty
 programs,
 you


know,
 for
 the
 retailers
 are
 great


because
 that
 gives
 them
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 on


their
 their
 customers
 that
 shop
 the
 most


with
 them.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 this
 is


where,
 you
 know,
 assortment
 matters
 and


exclusives
 matter.
 So,
 you
 know,
 Dick


Smaller
 Pier,
 Academy
 Sports,
 they
 have


not
 seen
 the
 growth
 that
 Dix
 is
 seeing.


And
 it's
 because
 they
 also
 carry
 Nike,


but
 they
 might
 not
 carry
 the
 brand
 new


Nike
 basketball
 sneakers
 for
 the
 season,


whereas
 Dix
 does.
 So,
 the
 assortment
 you


you
 really
 have
 to
 dive
 in
 and
 look
 at


very
 specifically,
 you
 know,
 what
 some


of
 these
 retailers
 have.
 They
 have
 to


have
 that
 newest
 product.
 They
 have
 to


have,
 you
 know,
 exclusive
 items
 where


you
 can't
 go
 elsewhere
 to
 get
 it.
 Um,


and
 that
 is
 really
 key
 to
 keeping
 that


customer
 back.
 I
 also
 think,
 you
 know,


when
 you
 have
 a
 positive
 experience


shopping
 at
 a
 retailer,
 you
 know,
 you're


going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 them
 as
 well
 for


that
 customer
 service
 or
 whatever
 it
 is


that
 they're
 providing
 to
 you
 that
 that


no
 one
 else
 can
 give
 you.
