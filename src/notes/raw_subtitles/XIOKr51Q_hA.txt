All
 right.
 You
 guys
 were
 uh
 talking


about
 the
 fun
 shenanigans
 you
 were


having
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 at
 Mark
 Beni


off's
 Dreamforce.
 Did
 you
 see
 Brian


Johnson
 was
 at
 Beni
 off's
 CEO
 dinner?


>> Oh,
 I
 didn't
 see
 him.


>> Yeah.


>> Matthew
 McConey
 was
 at
 our
 table
 at


dinner.


>> All
 right.
 All
 right.
 All right.


>> All right.
 All
 right.


>> McConey
 is
 fabulous.
 He
 is
 funny.


>> Did
 you
 see
 where
 I
 was
 sitting
 at
 that


dinner?


>> Yeah.
 Table
 one.


>> Right
 next
 to
 the
 king
 himself.
 The
 king


himself.
 Exactly.


>> The
 king
 who?
 The
 king
 and
 I.
 Benny
 off


is
 a
 king.


>> Well,
 he's
 the
 king
 of
 San
 Francisco


>> at
 his
 party.


>> He's
 the
 king
 of
 San
 Francisco.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 obviously
 he
 has
 to
 bend


the
 knee
 to
 the
 king
 of
 kings,
 which
 is


Trump,
 but


>> I
 was
 sitting
 next
 to
 Bennett
 off
 there.


>> It
 got
 weird.


>> It
 got
 a
 little
 weird.
 No.
 Well,
 what


happened
 was
 did
 you
 see
 that
 SF


standards?
 Yeah.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how


they
 can
 write
 a
 headline
 like
 this.
 So,


>> well,
 it's
 a
 San
 Francisco
 standard.


>> Yeah.
 So
 Beni
 off
 interviewed
 me
 at


Dreamforce
 and
 somehow
 this
 was
 like


headlinew
 worthy
 for
 SF
 Standard
 and


they
 said
 that
 Mark
 Beni
 off
 dodges


political
 questions
 then
 fawns
 over


David
 Sax
 on
 Dreamforce
 day
 one.
 That


was
 just
 referring
 to
 the
 interview
 we


did.
 So
 we
 trolled
 them
 by
 taking
 that


photo.


>> That's
 um
 Yeah,
 it's
 a
 little
 weird.


I
 thought
 the
 fireside
 chat
 you
 guys
 did


was
 great.


>> It
 was
 great.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 just
 an


interview.


>> It
 was
 really
 good
 actually.
 He's
 a
 very


good
 interviewer.


>> Mhm.
 Yeah,
 totally.
 But
 apparently
 to
 SF


Standard,
 it's
 like
 some
 sort
 of


transgression


that
 I
 was
 even
 interviewed.


>> They
 didn't
 get
 the
 memo
 that
 cancel


culture
 is
 over.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 can't.


>> I
 know.
 That's
 what
 it
 feels
 like,


right?
 Where
 they're
 like
 trying
 to


They're
 trying
 to
 jin
 up
 some
 sort
 of


>> brewhaha
 over
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 was


speaking.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 you
 can't
 talk
 to
 David
 Saxs.


He's
 in
 the
 Trump
 administration.
 Not


allowed
 to
 talk
 to
 him.


>> About
 100
 people
 a
 week
 who
 say
 that.


>> Literally
 the
 AI
 guy
 and
 the
 AI
 CEO


shouldn't
 talk
 to
 him.
 It's
 like,


>> you
 know,
 like
 what
 the
 AI
 company,
 I


should
 not
 talk
 to
 the
 government's
 AI


person,


>> right?
 By
 the
 way,
 did
 you
 see
 that


there
 was
 one
 other
 uh
 very
 important


conference
 in
 town
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as


Dreamforce?


>> Okay.


>> I
 discovered
 this
 on
 my
 ex
 feed.


>> Feel
 like
 a
 cold
 open
 about
 time.
 What?


The
 Young
 Socialists
 or
 was
 it
 the


Republicans?


>> It
 was
 called
 SlutCon.


>> Oh,
 Sluck
 Con?
 Really?


>> Oh
 my
 lord.
 Look
 at
 this
 website.


>> Oh,
 this
 is
 the
 agenda.
 How
 to
 be
 good


at
 sex
 with
 Aaliyah.
 Uh,
 let's
 see.


>> You
 cannot
 do
 this.
 Cut
 this
 out.


>> Women
 venting.
 Oh,
 Sachs,
 that
 one's
 for


you.


>> I
 would
 have
 planned
 an
 or


Freeberg
 here.
 Freeberg's
 giving
 a
 talk.


A
 fluffer's
 guide
 to
 jobs
 by
 David


Freeberg.
 Is
 that
 a
 panel
 or
 is
 it
 a


fireside
 freeberg?
 Which
 one?


>> Reinforcement
 learning.
 Ho
 feedback


small
 groups.


>> Oh,
 you
 could
 reandwrite
 your
 positions.


I
 see
 that.
 reunderwriting
 your
 sexual


positions
 by


>> Jamal's
 uh
 the
 last
 one.
 The
 VIP
 room.


>> Oh,
 VIP
 room.
 Yeah,
 that's
 Jamal.
 That's


for
 sure.
 Jamal


>> Sax,
 how
 did
 you
 hear
 about
 this?
 Don't


tell
 us
 that
 you
 ran
 out
 of
 bed.
 You


went
 over
 to
 the
 East
 Bay.


>> Sax,
 were
 you
 are
 you
 on
 the
 mailing


list?


>> No,
 my
 invite
 you
 to
 speak.


>> My
 ex
 feed
 just,
 you
 know,
 it's
 the
 new


AI
 algorithm
 is
 just
 trying
 to
 find


things
 you
 might
 be
 interested
 in.


>> Sax
 also
 keynoting
 this.
 My
 ex
 seed


showed
 me
 slutcon.
 So
 I
 clicked
 on
 it


and
 now
 it's
 been
 nothing
 but
 slutcon


for
 a
 couple
 of
 days.


[Music]


>> Let
 your
 winners
 ride.


[Music]


>> We
 open
 sourced
 it
 to
 the
 fans
 and


they've
 just
 gone
 crazy
 with
 it.


[Music]


>> Jimoth,
 what
 did
 you
 think
 about
 walking


around
 San
 Francisco?
 So,
 we
 went
 on
 a


walk
 around
 downtown
 San
 Francisco.


>> Well,
 we
 were
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 place
 to


get
 a
 drink
 in
 between
 the
 Beni
 off


dinner
 and
 Sax's
 talk.
 We
 ended
 up
 at


the
 W
 Hotel,
 but
 uh
 I
 was
 worried
 for


Chimath
 because
 it
 was
 his
 first
 time
 on


the
 streets
 of
 San
 Francisco
 walking


around
 with
 his
 own
 two
 legs.
 How
 was


it,
 Chimat?


>> Did
 you
 throw
 out
 those
 shoes?
 The
 lower


piano
 shoes.


>> I
 burned
 them.


>> The
 souls
 I'm
 sure
 were
 sullied
 beyond


repair.


>> I
 burned
 them.
 Those
 are
 one
 use
 for


Chimat.
 Those
 are
 single
 use
 lower


pianos.
 Once
 I
 got
 in
 the
 car,
 I
 I
 gave


Eugene
 my
 shoes
 and
 I
 said,
 "Burn
 these,


Eugene.
 I
 never
 want
 to
 see
 these
 ever


again.
 They've
 touched
 the
 pavement
 of


San
 Francisco."
 And
 all
 I
 said
 was,


"Yuck."


>> Why
 don't
 you
 just
 have
 your
 domestic


staff
 carry
 you
 on
 their
 shoulders?
 I


don't
 understand.


>> Why
 the
 crowd?
 It
 makes
 no
 sense.


>> So
 Ben
 off
 pulls
 off
 this
 awesome


convention,
 this
 conference,
 and
 then


Trump
 does
 this
 press
 conference


yesterday
 saying
 he's
 going
 to
 send


troops
 into
 San
 Francisco.
 Did
 you
 guys


see
 this?


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 yeah.
 But
 no,
 but
 the
 Benoff
 thing


happened
 first,
 right?
 So
 Ben
 off
 made


news
 because
 he
 said,
 "Send
 in
 the


National
 Guard
 to
 clean
 up
 San


Francisco."
 But
 I
 actually
 I
 talked
 to


him
 about
 it
 and
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of


context,


>> which
 of
 course


>> misqued
 or


>> Well,
 no,
 he
 wasn't
 misqued,
 but
 it


happened
 in
 a
 more
 innocuous
 way.
 He


wasn't
 trying
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 a
 political


issue.
 Basically,
 what
 happened
 is
 I


think
 he
 was
 describing
 the
 security
 at


Dreamforce
 and
 how
 they
 bring
 in
 a


couple
 hundred
 extra
 offduty
 cops
 to


provide
 security.
 So
 then
 the
 reporter


tried
 to
 stir
 the
 pot
 by
 saying,
 "Well,


would
 you
 bring
 in
 the
 National
 Guard?"


And
 Ben
 off
 said,
 "Sure,
 if
 they
 can
 be


cops."
 And
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 end
 of


it.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 it
 turns
 into
 this


massive
 story
 that
 Ben
 off
 is
 supporting


the
 National
 Guard
 coming
 to
 San


Francisco,
 which
 I
 think
 he
 should


support
 it,
 but


>> it's
 not
 exactly
 what
 he
 said.
 He
 was


saying
 for
 Dreamforce
 he
 would
 hire


them.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows
 exactly
 what
 he


was
 trying
 to
 say,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 that


>> he
 could
 have
 just
 been
 talking.
 Yeah.


>> He
 wasn't
 seeking
 to
 make
 the
 news
 that


ultimately
 he
 made,


>> but
 it's
 not
 a
 bad
 idea.
 It's
 actually
 a


good
 idea.
 Do
 you
 think
 Trump
 teed
 off


on
 that
 press
 cycle
 when
 he
 was
 doing


that
 press
 conference
 and
 it
 was
 kind
 of


off-the
 cuff
 sacks
 when
 he
 said,
 "Oh,


they
 should
 send
 the
 National
 Guard
 in


to
 San
 Francisco
 next."


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 wasn't
 there
 for
 that.
 But
 San


Francisco
 is
 a
 pretty
 obvious
 city
 to


send
 in
 the
 National
 Guard
 because
 we


have
 this
 downtown
 area
 where,
 you
 know,


it's
 like
 that
 zombie
 city
 area,
 the


Walking
 Dead
 part
 on
 on
 Market
 Street.


And
 everybody
 understands
 that
 it's


because
 they
 won't
 stop
 the
 drug


dealing.
 So
 you've
 got
 open
 air
 drug


markets
 there
 on
 the
 main
 business


thoroughfare
 of
 town,
 which
 is
 Market


Street.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 let
 me
 just
 back


up
 and
 say
 that
 we
 have
 the
 best
 mayor


we've
 had
 in
 decades
 now.


>> Dan
 Lori.


>> Dan
 Lur's
 great.
 And
 I
 think
 Brooke


Jenkins
 was
 the
 DA
 that
 we
 supported
 to


replace
 Chase
 Beauty
 and
 after
 we
 were


called
 him.
 So
 I
 think
 she's
 good,
 too.


But
 they're
 still
 working
 within
 the


confines
 of
 a
 legal
 system
 here
 which
 is


very
 left-wing.
 You've
 got
 all
 these


leftist
 judges
 and
 I
 think
 they're


somewhat
 constrained
 or
 hamstrung
 in


terms
 of
 what
 they
 can
 do.
 Again,
 the


evidence
 of
 that
 is
 that
 you've
 got


hundreds
 of
 these
 drug
 dealers
 who
 are


just
 operating
 with
 impunity
 in
 downtown


and
 you've
 got
 this
 sort
 of
 zombie
 city


of
 people
 who
 are
 so
 sick
 with
 drug


addiction
 that
 they're
 pretty
 much


living
 on
 the
 street.
 So,
 I
 think
 it


would
 be
 a
 relatively
 easy
 thing
 to


clean
 up
 if
 if
 they
 send
 in
 the
 National


Guard.


>> I
 would
 argue
 that
 they're
 like,
 cuz


I've
 been
 working
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 I


think
 it's
 gotten
 a
 lot
 better
 this


year.


>> So,
 I
 looked
 up
 after
 all
 this
 benny
 off


bruhaha
 and
 the
 National
 Guard
 thing


that
 Trump
 said
 yesterday.
 And
 so,
 the


city's
 publication
 shows
 crime
 down
 30%


citywide
 and
 down
 40%
 downtown.


Homicides
 on
 a
 70-year
 low
 this
 year.


There
 are
 record
 lows
 of
 the
 number
 of


tents
 left
 on
 the
 street.
 They've


cleaned
 up
 all
 the
 tents.
 And
 I've
 seen


this
 cuz
 I
 drive
 to
 my
 place
 in
 the
 city


and
 they're
 all
 gone.
 And
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 seven
 years,
 they've
 actually


got
 a
 net
 gain
 in
 total
 police
 officers


on
 the
 force.
 And
 now
 they've
 got


convention
 bookings
 up
 50%.
 With
 hotel


bookings
 up
 60%
 because
 of
 it.
 And
 so


here's
 what
 DA
 Jenkins
 put
 out.
 She
 said


felony
 convictions
 in
 cases
 this
 year,


narcotics,
 88%
 of
 cases
 have
 resulted
 in


convictions.
 Robbery,
 85%
 have
 resulted


in
 convictions.
 Burglary,
 72%
 in


convictions.
 And
 gun
 possession,
 70%
 of


cases
 result.
 And
 all
 the
 car
 break-ins


are
 down
 to
 a
 25-y
 year
 low.
 And
 so
 I've


noticed
 it
 acutely
 in
 my
 experience
 in


the
 city.
 So
 it
 felt
 a
 little
 shocking


to
 be
 like,
 oh,
 we
 need
 the
 National


Guard.
 This
 is
 like
 a
 city
 on
 the


upswing
 in
 my
 opinion.
 And
 I
 think


things
 are
 getting
 much
 better


anecdotally.
 and
 the
 statistics


represent
 it
 too.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it
 feels


it
 feels
 like
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


runaway
 narrative
 with
 San
 Francisco


relative
 to
 what
 I
 think
 we
 those
 of
 us


who
 are
 in
 the
 city
 are
 experiencing.


>> Let
 me
 thread
 these
 two
 stories
 together


and
 hand
 it
 to
 you,
 Sax.
 So,
 the
 the


interesting
 thing
 when
 Sax
 and
 I
 were
 um


ousting
 Chess
 Bodin,
 one
 of
 the
 things


we
 learned
 was
 Chess
 Bodin
 had
 this


famous
 quote
 where
 he
 was
 saying,
 "Oh,


well,
 we
 can't
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 fentinol


dealers.
 I'm
 for
 drug
 regulation
 but
 not


for
 fentinyl
 because
 it's
 a
 super
 drug


that
 kills
 people
 very
 quickly.
 And
 it


turned
 out
 he
 said
 all
 these
 Honduran


nationals
 were
 victims.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 I
 guess
 theoretically
 could
 be


true,
 but
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 in
 that
 what


do
 they
 call
 it?
 U
 suicidal
 empathy


category.


>> But
 it
 turns
 out
 this
 is
 something
 where


ICE
 and
 the
 DEA
 have
 done
 some
 work.


They
 actually
 started
 deporting
 these


people
 last
 year
 and
 because
 the
 people


in
 San
 Francisco
 pre
 Dan
 Lori
 refused
 to


do
 it.
 So
 the
 the
 the
 federal
 government


actually
 has
 been
 taking
 action
 on
 this


specific
 issue.
 And
 we've
 also
 been


taking
 out
 the
 boats
 bringing
 the
 drugs


here.
 Pretty


>> you're
 not
 seeing
 a
 city
 government
 try


to
 block
 federal
 action
 either,
 which
 is


different
 than
 what
 you
 see
 in
 other


cities.
 By
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 a
 good


forewarning
 of
 what
 Mani's
 New
 York
 is


going
 to
 look
 like
 when
 Mondani's
 New


York
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 takes
 off.


Imagine
 what's
 going
 to
 come
 into
 the


city
 because
 there's
 now
 going
 to
 be


permissive
 culture
 and,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 permissive
 society
 to
 do
 this
 sort
 of


stuff.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 where


we'll
 get
 strong
 alignment
 and
 agreement


like
 deporting
 Honduran
 fentinel


dealers.
 Like,
 what's
 taking
 so
 long?
 I


would
 ask
 the
 administration
 to
 take
 a


beat
 on
 the
 San
 Francisco
 thing
 because


this
 city
 is
 like
 making
 major


improvements
 and
 I
 feel
 very
 good
 about


the
 direction.
 It's
 not
 like
 other


cities
 that
 are
 on
 the
 down
 swing
 and


also
 I
 think
 AI
 companies
 are
 setting
 up


in
 San
 Francisco.


>> Money's
 coming
 back.
 Yeah.


I
 say
 the
 power
 move
 by
 Dan
 Lori
 would


be
 to
 say
 to
 the
 Trump
 administration,


hey,
 can
 we
 get
 I
 don't know
 three


months
 of
 National
 Guard
 just
 to
 be
 in


every
 BART
 station
 and
 then
 on
 these


four
 corners
 in
 the
 tenderloin
 just
 as
 a


deterrent.


>> You
 know what
 people
 would
 do
 if
 they


did
 that?
 People
 would
 protest
 and
 riot


because
 they're
 like
 we
 don't
 want


federal
 policing
 of
 our
 city.
 Like
 it's


going
 to
 be


>> for
 sure.
 I
 think
 you
 would
 get
 like
 10


20%
 even
 in
 San
 Francisco
 rioting.
 I


think
 the
 rest
 of the
 people
 would
 be


like
 okay
 it's
 a
 short
 duration.
 It's
 on


these
 corners
 for
 this
 purpose.
 Okay,


bring
 it.
 That's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 the


Democrats
 are
 making
 a
 stupid
 decision.


>> But
 if
 the
 city's
 doing
 their
 job
 and


the
 city's
 improving,
 why
 do
 you
 need


that?
 It's
 getting
 better.
 You
 know,


like
 this
 is
 not
 the


>> Yeah,
 that's
 if
 things
 are
 worse
 and


you're
 in
 a
 spiral.
 It


>> is
 a
 back
 stop.


>> Sure.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 that
 maybe
 the
 reason
 it's


getting
 better
 is
 because
 that
 backs


stop
 is
 there.


>> What?
 The
 National
 Guard
 back
 stop?


They're
 they're
 hiring
 more
 police.
 They


haven't
 done
 that
 in
 seven
 years
 in
 San


Francisco.
 They're
 finally
 adding
 to
 the


police
 cop
 under


>> and
 they're
 enforcing
 and
 they're


getting
 convictions.
 It's
 kind
 of


working.


>> Well,
 I'll
 partially
 agree
 with
 both
 of


you.


>> So,
 I
 agree
 with
 Freeberg
 that
 we
 have


the
 best
 mayor
 we've
 had
 in
 decades
 with


Daniel
 Lurri
 and
 I
 think
 he
 is
 making


progress
 and
 the
 city
 is
 bouncing
 back.


I
 think
 we
 probably
 had
 the
 lowest
 low


during
 co
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 just


the
 finally
 the
 bounce
 back
 and
 then
 we


got
 the
 AI
 boom
 which
 is
 creating
 a
 lot


of
 wealth
 and
 it's
 bringing
 a
 lot
 of


people
 back
 to
 the
 city
 and
 it's


starting
 to
 absorb
 all
 the
 vacancy
 we


have.
 So
 in
 any
 event
 all
 those
 are
 good


things.
 Nonetheless,
 we
 still
 have
 this


problem
 of
 this
 blighted
 area
 of
 Main


Street
 where
 of
 all
 people
 Gavin
 Newsome


proved
 that
 we
 could
 clean
 it
 up.


Remember
 when
 President
 Xi
 came
 to
 town


from
 China
 for
 that
 summit


>> and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 magically
 that
 whole


area
 was
 cleaned
 up
 in
 48
 hours


>> and
 you
 know
 all
 the
 drug
 addicts
 and


all
 the
 drug
 dealers
 basically


disappeared.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 they


sent
 them
 to.
 So
 it
 shows
 that
 there
 is


a
 way
 to
 clean
 this
 up
 virtually


overnight
 and
 I
 think
 that
 somehow
 the


mayor
 and
 the
 DA
 are
 constrained
 in
 what


they
 can
 do.
 So
 you
 could
 have
 a


targeted
 operation
 here
 by
 the
 federal


authorities
 to
 go
 in
 and
 clean
 that
 up.


And
 I
 think
 that'd
 be
 a
 good
 thing.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 would
 happen
 in
 the


city
 if
 they
 did
 that
 with
 respect
 to


the
 population?
 Are
 they
 going
 to


welcome
 or
 not
 welcome
 federal
 policing


of
 their
 streets?


>> Well,
 again,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 be


held
 hostage
 by
 lawb
 breakakers
 who


basically
 threaten
 violent
 protests
 and


chaos
 in
 response
 to
 law
 enforcement


authorities
 doing
 their
 job.
 I
 don't


think
 we
 should
 be
 blackmailed
 by
 that


or
 threatened
 by
 that
 or
 held
 hostage
 by


that.


>> But
 they're
 getting
 convictions.
 They're


making
 arrests.


>> I
 think
 that's
 awesome.
 I'm
 I'm


applauding
 their
 efforts
 and
 I'm
 not


criticizing
 them.
 What
 I'm
 saying
 is
 we


still
 have
 this
 intractable
 problem
 of


this
 area
 of
 downtown
 where
 like
 Jal


said,
 there's
 a
 network
 of
 drug
 dealers.


Just
 to
 build
 on
 your
 point,
 Jacob,


about
 the
 Hondurans,
 there's
 actually
 an


article
 in
 the
 San
 Francisco
 Chronicle


talking
 about
 this
 where
 the
 majority
 of


the
 drug
 trade
 in
 San
 Francisco
 comes


from
 a
 single
 town
 in
 South
 America.


>> And
 so,
 yeah,
 it's
 like
 why
 couldn't
 you


just
 round
 up
 this
 whole
 network
 in
 a


very
 targeted
 operation
 and
 deport
 them


and
 that
 would
 clean
 up
 a
 huge
 part
 of


San
 Francisco.
 I
 think
 there's
 an


opportunity
 here.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


cities
 where
 it's
 been
 very
 successful,


so
 Muriel
 Bowser,
 who's
 the
 mayor
 of
 DC,


obviously
 she
 wasn't
 thrilled
 about
 the


president
 sending
 in
 the
 National
 Guard


and
 she
 said
 so
 publicly.
 That
 being


said,
 she
 also
 cooperated
 with
 it
 and
 it


redounded
 to
 the
 benefit
 of
 all
 the


citizens
 of
 Washington
 DC.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 an
 opportunity
 here
 for
 the


mayor
 to
 cooperate
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 do
 a
 targeted


exercise
 and
 clean
 up
 the
 streets
 of
 San


Francisco.
 I
 think


>> or
 he
 can
 do
 it
 himself
 up
 himself
 for


Did
 you
 guys
 see
 this
 interview
 with


this
 woman
 in
 DC
 who
 was
 describing
 what


it's
 been
 like
 in
 DC
 over
 the
 last
 40


years
 and
 see
 the
 changes.


>> Yeah,
 she
 feels
 safe.


>> Elon
 retweeted
 it.
 Nick,
 I
 sent
 you
 the


link
 on
 Signal.
 Just
 listen
 to
 what
 she


says.
 It's
 really
 to
 your
 point,
 Sax,


it's
 like
 it's
 just
 such
 a
 nobrainer


thing
 to
 do.
 The
 question
 now
 is
 I
 think


is
 a
 political
 calculation.
 Who
 wants
 to


take
 credit
 for
 it?
 Because
 everybody


should
 be
 doing
 this.


>> Oh,
 let's
 listen
 to
 this.
 I'm
 always
 got


to
 be
 the
 person
 to
 say
 it
 and
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 the
 person
 to
 say
 it.


But
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 been
 president
 for


nine
 months.
 Nine
 months.
 And
 I'm
 seeing


videos
 from
 Chicago,


DC,
 where
 people
 like,
 "Yo,
 I
 feel
 safe.


My
 kids
 feel
 safe.
 This
 is
 the
 best


thing
 he
 ever
 did
 for
 us."
 So,
 what
 was


happening
 all
 these
 years
 that
 this
 like


literally
 I'm
 I've
 known
 DC
 and
 Virginia


to
 have
 this
 type
 of
 [ __ ]
 going
 my
 whole


life,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 my
 40s.
 Okay.


Almost
 touching
 it.
 So
 what
 was
 really


truly
 going
 on
 if
 a
 mother
 became


president
 9
 months
 ago


and
 cleared
 that
 out
 with
 just
 a
 flick


of
 a
 pen.
 I'm
 just
 thinking
 like
 did


y'all
 really
 ever
 care?


>> Exactly.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 the
 point
 she's


making
 there
 is
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 live


this
 way.
 This
 is
 a
 choice.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 live
 in
 San


Francisco
 with
 our
 main
 drag,
 our
 main


street,
 Market
 Street,
 basically
 being


an
 open
 air
 drug
 market
 where
 you've
 got


hundreds
 of
 people
 who
 are
 addicted


doing
 drugs
 in
 the
 street,
 you
 know,


doing
 other
 things
 in
 the
 street.
 And


again,
 Gavin
 Newsome
 proved
 that
 it


could
 all
 be
 cleaned
 up
 very,
 very


quickly.
 So,
 look,
 I
 think
 it's
 great


that
 Daniel
 Lur
 and
 Brook
 Jenkins
 and


the
 new
 administration
 are
 doing
 a


better
 job,
 but
 they're
 still


constrained
 and
 hamstrung
 by
 their
 own


>> by
 the
 city's
 hold
 on
 by
 the
 city's


>> liberal
 mindset,
 extreme
 liberal
 mindset


towards
 what's
 possible.
 And
 I
 think


like
 that
 person
 just
 said
 in
 the
 video,


Trump
 just
 did
 it
 with
 a
 stroke
 of
 a


pen.
 This
 is
 a
 choice.
 We
 don't
 have
 to


live
 this
 way.


>> It's
 the
 biggest
 unforced
 era
 since


opening
 the
 southern
 border.
 These
 are


just
 the
 two
 stupidest
 decisions
 the


Democrats
 ever
 made.
 And
 obviously
 the


easiest
 thing
 to
 do
 to
 split
 the
 the
 two


approaches
 here,
 Freedberg,
 is


>> to
 have
 Dan
 Lorie
 say,


>> "Thank
 you
 for
 offering
 Trump.


>> We
 would
 like
 to
 have
 it
 for
 this
 period


of
 time
 in
 this
 location."
 Then
 you


could
 communicate
 to
 the
 people
 of
 San


Francisco,
 it's
 just
 a
 test.
 It's
 just


on
 these
 streets.
 When
 it
 comes
 top
 down


and
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 choice
 and
 JB


Pritsker
 does
 what
 he
 did,
 which
 is
 I'm


going to
 ban
 you
 from
 coming
 in
 and


reducing
 crime.
 Like,
 do
 you
 hear


yourself,
 Pritker?
 Like,
 I
 want
 to
 stop


you
 from
 lowering
 crime.


>> There's
 something
 else
 we
 got
 to
 do
 as


well,
 which
 is
 we
 got
 to
 stop
 funding


the
 drug
 addiction
 because
 the
 city


provides
 something
 like
 $2
 billion
 a


year
 to
 these
 NOS's
 who
 are
 supposedly


there
 to
 quote
 take
 care
 of
 this


homeless/addicted


population
 and
 they
 manage
 them
 like


their
 flock
 because
 for
 every
 addicted


person
 they
 add
 to
 the
 flock,
 they
 get


paid
 more
 money.
 And
 so,
 obviously,
 this


is
 why
 we
 have
 this
 problem
 here.
 And
 in


fact,
 the
 homeless
 we
 have
 in
 San


Francisco
 are
 not
 predominantly
 from
 San


Francisco.
 They're
 from
 all
 over
 the


country,
 all
 over
 the
 surrounding
 area.


They
 come
 here
 for
 the
 benefits.
 So,
 we


create
 the
 magnet
 for
 all
 these
 people.


So,


>> part
 of
 it
 is
 law
 enforcement,
 then
 also


part
 of
 it
 is
 just
 cut
 off
 the
 flow
 of


money
 that's
 funding
 their
 drug


addictions.


>> You
 are
 100%
 correct
 on
 that.
 I


completely
 agree
 with
 you
 on
 that
 point.


And
 I
 think
 that
 forced
 treatment
 center


transitions
 is
 needed.
 Obviously,
 you


know,
 we
 have
 a
 program,
 I've
 mentioned


this
 on
 the
 show
 before,
 but
 for
 those


who
 haven't
 heard
 about
 it,
 to
 hear


about
 the
 absurdity
 of
 these
 programs
 in


San
 Francisco.
 There's
 a
 program
 called


the
 managed
 alcohol
 program.
 $5
 million


per
 year
 out
 of
 the
 San
 Francisco
 city


budget
 is
 spent
 on
 this
 program
 where
 uh


you
 can
 walk
 into
 a
 hotel,
 they
 have


free
 beer.
 You
 ask
 for
 a
 beer,
 they
 give


you
 a
 beer.


>> What?


>> You
 drink
 the
 beer,
 you
 go
 out,
 you


party,
 you
 come
 back,
 you
 get
 another


beer.
 So
 they
 have
 all
 these
 studies


that
 rationalize
 this
 program
 which
 is


oh
 this
 is
 a
 way
 to
 help
 alcoholics


recover
 from
 alcoholism
 when
 they're


homeless
 and
 they
 need
 this
 treatment


but
 here
 you
 can
 see
 this
 is
 from
 last


year
 being
 beer.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 treatment
 is
 beer
 and


>> that
 works
 for
 alcoholism
 I've
 heard.


But
 it's
 one
 of
 these
 absurd
 things


where
 now
 it's
 kind
 of a
 joke
 because


there's
 also
 this
 close
 part
 of
 downtown


where
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


kind
 of
 do
 what
 you
 want
 where
 they
 kind


of
 keep
 folks
 it's
 like
 hey
 you
 can
 use


your
 needles
 here
 then
 folks
 will
 get
 a


drink
 they'll
 play
 music
 they'll
 go


after
 the
 thing.
 It's
 really
 sad
 how


these
 programs
 obviously


well-intentioned
 initially
 become
 of
 the


most
 absurd.


>> If
 you
 want
 more
 of
 something
 keep


spending
 money
 on
 it.
 Uh,
 in
 fact,
 there


is
 a
 program
 for
 people
 who
 are
 addicted


to
 gambling
 and
 they
 they
 give
 Chimoth


free
 flags
 and
 cranberries
 at
 the
 win
 to


help
 him
 with
 his
 crafts
 advent.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 amazing.
 If
 you
 uh
 if
 I
 keep


going,
 one's
 going
 to
 land.


>> You
 send
 a
 private
 jet
 and
 extend
 a


massive
 credit
 line.
 It's
 amazing
 how


how
 many
 gambling
 addicts
 you
 you'll


attract
 to
 your
 casino.


>> By
 the
 way,
 did
 you
 guys
 see
 that
 JB


Pritsker
 disclosed
 his
 income
 from
 2024?


And


>> oh,
 let's
 guess
 over
 under.
 Give
 us
 an


overunder.


>> Out
 of
 the
 10.3
 million,
 1.4
 million
 of


it
 was
 gambling
 winnings
 from
 Vegas.


>> What?
 Yum
 yum.
 Okay.
 All
 new
 respect.


>> 1.4
 million
 playing
 black.
 So,
 he's


counting
 cards.
 Yeah,
 definitely.


Definitely
 counting
 cards
 with
 sachs.


Yeah.


>> Well,
 no.
 I
 I'll
 just
 tell
 you
 like
 look


to
 win
 $1.4
 million
 in
 black
 basically


you
 basically
 need
 to
 be
 betting
 100k
 a


hand.


>> Even
 I
 don't
 do
 that.
 That's
 the
 only


way
 you
 can
 win
 that
 much,
 which
 is
 a


lot
 of
 money
 per
 hand.
 Not
 judging.
 I'm


just
 saying.


>> I
 mean,
 that's
 Dana
 White
 level.
 He's


He's
 Dana
 White
 level
 that
 David
 Sachs


at
 Caesars.


>> No,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 at
 that
 level.


>> Come
 on.
 David
 plays
 at
 the
 $100
 a
 hand


table.
 He's
 got
 great.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,


just
 to
 put
 some
 numbers
 behind
 it.


>> Speaking
 of
 Vegas,
 aren't
 we
 going
 next


next
 month?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Yum.
 Yum.


>> Yum.
 Yum.
 Just
 to
 put
 some
 numbers
 on


it,
 homeless
 budget,
 San
 Francisco,


unbelievably


high
 estimate
 like
 800
 million,
 lower


estimate
 700
 million.
 And
 uh
 low


estimate
 for
 homeless
 people
 is
 like


8,000.
 High
 estimates
 like
 20.
 If
 you


cut
 in
 between
 these
 two,
 they're


spending
 $52,000
 a
 year
 per
 homeless


person.
 $52,000


a
 year.
 It
 is
 a
 solve
 problem.
 Well,


that
 is
 an
 incentive
 to
 solve
 the


problem
 because
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


money
 goes
 to
 NOS's
 and
 they
 get
 paid


for
 every
 addict
 they
 can
 add
 to
 their


flock.
 Thomas
 had
 a
 great
 line
 about


this.
 He
 said
 that
 you
 get
 as
 much


homelessness
 as
 you're
 willing
 to
 pay


for.


>> Well,
 and
 your
 point
 before
 is
 other


places
 don't
 give
 the
 services.
 So


therefore,
 the
 homeless
 uh
 slashjunkies


converse
 about
 this
 and
 then
 they
 pick


the
 right.


>> We
 don't
 have
 to
 live
 this
 way.
 I


appreciate
 the
 mayor.
 I
 appreciate
 the


DA,
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 live
 this
 way


and
 there's
 more
 that
 can
 be
 done.


>> That
 is
 exactly
 it.
 You
 do
 not
 have
 to


live
 this
 way.


>> Yes.
 Do
 not
 stand
 for
 it,
 folks.
 Okay,


here
 we
 go.
 Lots
 of
 topics.
 The
 USChina


trade
 battle
 is
 continuing.
 Uh,
 and
 this


time
 we
 have
 a
 new
 wrinkle.
 Trump
 and


she
 are
 set
 to
 meet
 in
 South
 Korea
 later


this
 month.
 They're
 going
 to
 work
 out
 a


grand
 trade
 deal.
 And
 this
 would
 be


their
 first
 in-person
 meeting
 since


2019,
 6
 years
 ago.
 But
 last
 Thursday,


China
 announced
 new
 export
 controls
 on


12
 of
 17
 critical
 rare
 earth
 minerals


effective
 December
 1st.
 Obviously,
 we


need
 these
 for
 EVs,
 batteries,
 your


AirPods,
 everything.
 And
 on
 Friday,


Trump
 threatened
 100%
 tariff
 on
 all


Chinese
 imports
 on
 top
 of
 the
 existing


tariffs
 as
 of
 November
 1st
 and
 accused


the
 CCP
 of
 trying
 to
 quote
 hold
 the


world
 captive.
 Stock
 market
 tanked,


recovered
 on
 Monday
 when
 Trump
 told


everybody,
 "Don't
 worry
 about
 it.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 all
 good."
 So
 far
 this
 week,


things
 have
 mostly
 deescalated.
 Friend


of
 the
 pod,
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott


Bessant
 said
 the
 Trump
 meeting
 is
 still


on
 track
 and
 quote,
 "We
 have


substantially
 deescalated."
 Also,
 he


said
 the
 100%
 tariff
 does
 not
 have
 to


happen.
 However,
 on
 Wednesday,
 Vesscent


called
 the
 export
 controls
 unacceptable


and
 that
 it's
 China
 versus
 the
 free


world.
 Let's
 take
 a
 pause
 here.


Freeberg,
 thoughts
 on
 price
 controls


generally,
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 expand


into
 the
 overall
 relationship
 with
 China


as
 it
 relates
 to
 rare
 earth
 metals,
 go


for
 it.
 Bessum's
 comments
 on
 the
 price


controls
 speak
 to
 what
 he
 calls
 a


non-market
 economy,
 meaning
 that
 the


Chinese
 government
 is
 intervening
 and


creating
 artificial
 surplus
 in
 the


market,
 which
 drives
 prices
 down
 and


effectively
 eliminates
 competition.
 And


so
 the
 Chinese
 push
 in
 the
 '90s,


supported
 by
 the
 CCP,
 ultimately


eradicated
 competition
 and
 made
 it


non-competitive
 for
 US
 companies.
 So


they
 exited
 the
 market
 and
 now
 the


United
 States
 finds
 itself
 completely


dependent
 on
 Chinese
 suppliers.


Particularly
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 rare


earths,
 there
 was
 this
 company
 called


Molly
 Corp
 that
 ended
 up
 going
 out
 of


business.
 The
 asset,
 the
 Mountain
 Pass


mine
 that
 Molly
 Corp
 operated,
 became
 MP


Materials,
 which
 Chimoth
 knows
 well
 and


did
 this
 big
 deal
 recently
 with
 the
 US


government
 as
 they've
 tried
 to


revitalize
 production
 at
 this
 mine
 and


increase
 output.
 Freeberg,
 can
 you


explain
 price
 floors
 for
 people
 just
 in


case?


>> So
 price
 floors
 are
 that
 the
 government


is
 going
 to
 mandate
 that
 things
 have
 to


cost
 at
 least
 X.
 So
 they
 increase
 the


price
 of
 inputs
 and
 basically
 make
 it


more
 difficult
 for
 China
 to
 undercut


pricing
 which
 increases
 the
 rationale


for
 capital
 to
 invest
 in
 starting


competitors
 because
 now
 they
 can
 have
 a


guarantee
 of
 revenue
 or
 guarantee
 of


price.
 But
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 I
 would


argue
 the
 government's
 role
 maybe


shouldn't
 be
 in
 setting
 price
 floors


because
 that
 creates,
 you
 know,
 a
 very


bad
 effect
 long
 term
 on
 the
 market.
 The


government
 should
 deregulate
 and
 create


a
 more
 free
 market
 in
 the
 US.
 A
 large


reason
 why
 mining
 and
 processing
 of
 the


ores
 moved
 offshore
 was
 because
 of
 the


regulatory
 environment
 in
 the
 United


States
 which
 made
 it
 difficult
 to


compete
 with
 China.
 We
 could
 argue
 about


the
 environmental
 laws
 and
 how
 extensive


and
 how
 relevant
 they
 may
 be
 today


relative
 to
 the
 '90s,
 but
 this
 created
 a


real
 challenge
 for
 companies
 to
 compete


because
 it
 was
 so
 much
 more
 expensive
 to


operate
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 I
 would
 argue
 we


should
 be
 focusing
 not
 so
 much
 on


setting
 price
 floors
 to
 create
 an


incentive
 for
 folks
 in
 the
 US
 to
 get


involved
 in
 the
 industry,
 but
 rather
 to


deregulate
 and
 to
 provide
 perhaps
 tax


incentives
 and
 other
 economic


incentives.
 So
 you
 don't
 inflate
 the


cost
 of
 things,
 but
 you
 create
 a
 much


more
 kind
 of
 liquid
 market
 and
 drive


much
 more
 volume
 and
 interest
 in
 in


building
 on
 this
 side.


>> All
 right,
 price
 flaws.
 When
 we
 were


talking
 about
 Kla
 Harris
 running
 for


president,
 she
 was
 asking
 for
 price


flaws
 and
 price
 fixing
 and
 making
 sure


the
 government
 got
 involved
 in
 this.
 How


is
 this
 different,
 sex?
 Well,
 look,
 as
 a


general
 matter,
 I
 agree
 that
 the
 federal


government
 shouldn't
 be
 setting
 the


prices
 of
 goods
 and
 it
 shouldn't
 be


picking
 winners
 and
 losers
 in
 the


economy.
 But
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 different


situation
 because
 over
 the
 past
 30


years,
 we
 haven't
 really
 had
 a
 free


market
 in
 rare
 earth.
 What's
 basically


happened
 like
 Freeberg
 was
 saying,
 China


has
 been
 allowed
 to
 dominate
 this


industry.
 And
 specifically
 what
 they
 did


is
 starting
 30
 years
 ago,
 they


identified
 rare
 earths
 and
 rare
 earth


magnets,
 the
 rare
 earth
 processing
 as
 a


very
 strategic
 element
 in
 the
 supply


chain.
 And
 they
 set
 out
 to
 dominate
 it.


And
 they
 did
 that
 by
 massly
 subsidizing


their
 businesses
 and
 driving
 all
 of
 the


US
 competitors
 and
 the
 global


competitors
 out
 of
 business.
 And
 they


were
 partially
 allowed
 to
 do
 that
 by


stupid
 WTO
 rules
 that
 allowed
 quote


unquote
 developing
 nations
 to
 subsidize


their
 own
 industries
 even
 though
 China


is
 not
 developing.
 I
 mean
 their
 economy


is
 comparable
 to
 ours.
 And
 yet
 these
 WTO


rules
 allowed
 them
 to
 effectively
 cheat


by
 subsidizing
 their
 industries
 at
 the


expense
 of
 our
 industries.
 And
 the


result
 of
 this
 is
 that
 they
 do
 now
 have


course
 of
 leverage
 over
 the
 supply


chain.
 And
 over
 the
 last
 few
 weeks,
 they


just
 used
 that
 imposing
 this
 vast
 new


export
 control
 regime
 on
 rare
 earth.
 And


their
 idea
 is
 to
 tighten
 the
 screws
 when


they
 feel
 like
 it
 and
 to
 use
 rare
 earth


as
 a
 form
 of
 leverage
 in
 the


relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States.
 So,


we're
 well
 past
 economics
 here
 and
 we're


into
 international
 relations.
 We're
 into


the
 balance
 of
 power.
 We're


international
 security.
 And
 I
 don't


think
 that
 the
 price
 floors
 here
 are


designed
 to
 make
 the
 government
 the


mediator
 of
 what
 prices
 should
 be
 in
 the


free
 market.
 They're
 designed
 to
 create


enough
 certainty
 for
 US
 investors
 that


they
 can
 reinvest
 in
 rare
 earths
 and


reshore
 the
 processing
 and
 the
 casting


of
 rare
 earth
 magnets.
 And
 I
 just
 don't


see
 another
 way
 to
 be
 able
 to
 create
 the


incentives
 for
 investors
 because
 they


know
 that
 if
 they
 invest
 a
 lot
 of
 money


in
 rare
 earth
 processing
 that
 all
 China


has
 to
 do
 is
 slash
 the
 prices
 and
 drive


them
 out
 of
 business.
 And
 China


continually
 uses
 that
 tactic.
 So
 I
 think


you
 have
 to
 address
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to


alleviate
 the
 American
 dependency
 on


this
 critical
 resource
 which
 China


currently
 has
 control
 over.
 This
 started


in
 2007
 or
 eight
 with
 Huenta
 and
 what
 he


basically
 said
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 create


six
 or
 seven
 national
 champions
 and
 he


wanted
 to
 create
 them
 in
 the
 critical


areas
 that
 they
 needed
 to
 dominate
 over


the
 next
 20
 years
 and
 one
 of
 those
 was


rare
 earths.
 Another
 one
 was
 batteries


and
 EVs
 and
 yet
 another
 one
 was
 around


the
 active
 principal
 ingredients
 or
 APIs


that
 are
 the
 core
 inputs
 for


pharmaceuticals.
 So
 what
 do
 they
 do?
 And


when
 Ji
 came
 into
 power,
 Xi
 Jinping


continued
 that
 huge
 gental
 strategy.


What
 did
 they
 do?
 It's
 exactly
 what
 Sach


said,
 which
 is
 they
 have
 this
 very


aggressive
 form
 of
 mercantalism.
 How
 do


they
 affect
 that?
 They
 are
 willing


through
 provincial
 balance
 sheets,


through
 federal
 balance
 sheets,
 through


loan
 guarantees,
 through
 organizations


that
 are
 quasi
 public
 private


partnerships.
 They
 step
 into
 markets
 and


they
 can
 effectively
 change
 the
 spot


price
 on
 demand.
 Now,
 why
 is
 that


problematic
 in
 America?
 I'll
 tell
 you


the
 example
 of
 one
 of
 our
 businesses.


You
 do
 these
 deals
 that
 are
 called
 take


or
 pay
 agreements.
 So,
 MP
 has
 a
 deal


with
 General
 Motors,
 one
 of
 my


businesses
 that
 makes
 LFP
 cathode.
 Same


deal
 with
 GM.
 You
 do
 what's
 called
 a


take
 or
 pay,
 which
 means
 that
 General


Motors
 steps
 up
 and
 says,
 "Great,
 I
 will


buy
 X
 amount
 of
 volume
 from
 you
 at
 Y


price.


And
 so
 you
 go
 and
 you
 take
 that
 deal
 to


Wall
 Street
 and
 you
 say,
 "I
 need


financing
 to
 build
 a
 factory
 or
 a


capability."
 Contrast
 that
 to
 the


Chinese
 company
 who
 just
 goes
 to
 the


government
 and
 the
 government
 says,


"Here's
 a
 bunch
 of
 incentives
 and
 money


and
 price
 breaks.
 Just
 go
 build
 it."
 So


already
 we're
 a
 little
 bit
 behind,
 but


it's
 much
 more
 free
 market
 and
 it's
 more


transparent.
 So
 you
 take
 a
 deal,
 you
 go


to
 Wall
 Street,
 they
 give
 you
 money,
 you


start
 building
 it,
 you
 start
 to
 produce


it,
 and
 then
 you
 expect
 General
 Motors


or
 Ford
 or
 Tesla
 to
 start
 buying
 this


stuff.
 But
 as
 Sax
 said,
 if
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 China
 sees
 it,
 what
 they
 do
 is


they
 enter
 the
 market
 and
 they
 will
 dump


an
 enormous
 volume
 of
 that
 product
 into


the
 spot
 market.
 What
 happens?
 The
 price


craters.
 Now
 all
 of
 these
 end
 buyers
 are


in
 a
 really
 tough
 position
 because
 their


competitors
 can
 buy
 at
 a
 much
 bigger


discount
 that
 they
 can.
 They
 have
 to


flow
 that
 price
 through
 their
 products.


Their
 prices
 are
 more
 expensive.
 They


have
 less
 demand.
 And
 that's
 the
 huge


negative
 cycle
 that
 China
 has
 complete


control
 of.
 So
 why
 is
 the
 federal


government
 stepping
 in
 to
 create
 what
 is


essentially
 a
 last
 resort
 buyer
 of


record?
 It
 is
 so
 critical
 in
 these


markets
 because
 the
 US
 balance
 sheet
 is


the
 only
 one
 that
 can
 create
 a
 strategic


reserve
 around
 these
 inputs.
 Not


dissimilar
 to
 how
 we
 do
 with
 petroleum.


We
 can
 nominate
 now
 things
 that
 are


critical
 dispos


all
 of
 these
 things
 that
 can
 now
 absorb


the
 price
 shocks
 that
 China
 may


otherwise
 be
 able
 to
 affect.
 So
 I
 think


this
 structure
 where
 we
 now
 have
 these


public
 private
 partnerships
 frankly
 is


the
 only
 practical
 antidote
 to
 dealing


with
 this
 issue.
 Otherwise
 we're
 always


going
 to
 be
 prone
 to
 this
 very
 clever


and
 accurate
 and
 smart
 mercantalism
 from


the
 Chinese.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of


this
 general
 market
 structure.
 It's
 the


only
 way
 that
 you
 cannot
 be
 theoretical


and
 actually
 respond
 to
 the
 conditions


on
 the
 ground.
 Yeah,
 we've
 been
 doing
 a


little
 research
 on
 this
 and
 here
 is


neodyinium.


>> This
 is
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 two
 inputs


for
 for
 magnets
 for
 permanent
 magnets.


>> And
 uh
 you
 can
 see
 here
 $50,000
 for
 a


ton
 back
 in
 2020
 during
 CO
 it
 spiked


almost
 up
 to
 a
 quarter
 million
 dollars


and
 then
 it
 came
 back
 down.
 So
 look,
 you


can
 you
 can
 imagine
 like
 it's
 incredibly


difficult
 when
 there's
 that
 much


volatility


>> to
 try
 to
 buy
 capex,
 to
 try
 to
 plant


opex,
 to
 try
 to
 extract
 from
 the
 ground,


go
 through
 all
 of
 the
 regulatory


rigomearroll
 that
 western
 countries
 have


to
 go
 through
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


have
 a
 sale
 price
 that
 you
 can't


control.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 cost,
 we


were
 just
 doing
 some
 research
 on
 it.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 get
 your
 AirPods,
 it's
 one


or
 two%
 of
 the
 cost
 of
 that.
 medical


devices,
 it's
 a
 lot
 more.
 But
 even
 in
 a


Tesla
 Model
 Y,
 it's
 it's
 le
 it's
 10


dips.


>> It's
 less
 than
 I
 think
 this
 is
 an


inaccurate
 way
 of
 looking
 at
 it.
 You


have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 actual
 mass.


And
 so
 the
 real
 problem
 is
 in
 in
 cars,


in
 engines,
 you're
 talking
 about
 tens
 of


kilos
 ultimately,
 and
 that's
 where
 the


real
 costs
 build
 up.
 And
 then


separately,
 the
 permanent
 magnets
 that


go
 into
 cars,
 you
 can
 work
 your
 way


around.
 The
 real
 in
 future
 markets
 that


really
 matter
 is
 in
 robotics
 because


these
 permanent
 magnets
 are
 the
 key


input
 to
 the
 actuation
 mechanism
 of
 the


robots.
 Meaning
 how
 do
 the
 robots
 move?


How
 do
 the
 joints
 move?
 Through


actuation
 that
 happens
 because
 of
 rare


earths
 and
 permanent
 magnets.


>> And
 as
 Elon
 said
 at
 the
 summit,
 he's


building
 all
 those
 himself.


Right
 now,
 only
 7%
 of
 the
 known
 deposits


of
 it
 have
 been
 found.
 There's
 plenty
 of


it
 out
 there.
 But
 to
 your
 point,
 I
 came


to
 the
 same
 conclusion
 as
 you,
 Chimath,


which
 is
 we
 should
 be
 building
 a


strategic
 reserve
 of
 these.
 And
 if
 you


look,
 we
 could
 be,
 you
 know,
 buying
 them


when
 these
 things
 are
 down
 and
 deploying


them


>> when
 we
 need
 to
 do
 something
 different.


I
 think
 instead
 of
 trying
 to
 like
 time


the
 market,
 I
 think
 what
 the
 United


States
 can
 be
 much
 better
 at
 is
 having
 a


broad
 forecast
 of
 demand,
 knowing
 how


many
 million
 tons
 of
 this
 stuff
 we
 will


need
 and
 just
 thoughtfully
 and


methodically
 being
 a
 purchaser
 of
 record


to
 create
 these
 strategic
 reserves.
 And


then
 the
 worst
 case
 that
 can
 happen
 is


you
 can
 do
 a
 swap


>> with
 these
 customers.
 So
 Tesla
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 can't
 go
 into
 the
 spot
 market.


They
 should
 be
 able
 to
 come
 to
 the


strategic
 reserve
 and
 be
 able
 to
 buy


lithium.
 you
 know,
 General
 Motors
 needs


something,
 whomever,
 right?
 Figure


robots
 need
 something.
 I
 think
 that


mechanism
 is
 the
 only
 way
 we
 can
 compete


effectively
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis
 with


the
 Chinese.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 would
 argue
 I
 think
 we


actually
 if
 we
 let
 the
 market
 work
 and


we
 create
 the
 necessary
 kind
 of


structure
 to
 allow
 the
 market
 to


operate,
 meaning
 the
 regulatory
 barriers


are
 diminished
 to
 develop
 mines
 and
 to


conduct
 the
 processing
 of
 the
 ores.
 So


there's
 two
 sides
 of
 the
 equation
 when


it
 comes
 to
 this
 kind
 of
 industry
 of


rare
 earths.
 The
 one
 is
 mining
 the
 ore.


You
 know
 this
 mountain
 pass
 site
 which


is
 kind
 of
 on
 the
 border
 of
 California


and
 Nevada
 which
 is
 now
 MP
 materials.


They've
 got
 this
 rare
 earth
 ore
 called


bastnite.
 That's
 the
 ore
 that
 you
 get


out
 of
 the
 ground.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 to


process
 that
 ore
 to
 get
 the
 elements
 out


of
 the
 ore
 that
 you
 want
 to
 use
 in


manufacturing.
 The
 processing
 steps.
 I


kind
 of
 went
 a
 little
 bit
 deep
 on
 this


over
 the
 last
 week
 because
 I
 got
 really


interested
 in
 why
 we
 don't
 do
 this


anymore
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 there


is
 so
 much
 nasty


output
 from
 this
 process.
 You're
 using


very
 strong
 acids
 to
 do
 leeching.
 You
 do


processing,
 you
 do
 extraction,


refinement.
 All
 of
 the
 material
 kind
 of


gets
 separated
 out
 from
 the
 rock
 and


it's
 dirty.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 there's


byproducts
 and
 waste
 and
 environmental


exposure,
 but
 also
 human
 personnel


exposure.
 But
 the
 technology
 hasn't
 been


deeply
 developed
 in
 40
 years.
 It's
 still


kind
 of
 40-year-old
 chemical
 engineering


technology.
 And
 we
 stopped
 developing
 it


about
 40
 years
 ago
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> It's
 not
 even
 technology.
 It's
 no


>> Yeah,
 it's
 not.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just


metallergy
 and
 chemistry.
 But
 but
 there


are
 techniques
 now
 that
 can
 be
 applied


that
 can
 do
 this
 in
 a
 kind
 of
 scalable


safer
 way
 without
 any
 of
 the


environmental
 hazards.
 But
 this
 is


largely
 why
 this
 shifted
 over
 to
 China


is
 they
 didn't
 have
 the
 sort
 of


regulatory
 um
 burdens
 that
 we
 have
 in


the
 United
 States
 which
 made
 it
 much


cheaper
 and
 the
 labor
 cost
 was
 much


lower.
 But
 with
 automation
 and
 certain


systems
 we
 can
 actually
 process
 this


ore.
 It's
 not
 super
 complicated.
 It's
 a


series
 of
 well
 understood
 steps
 of


chemistry
 and
 mechanical
 separation.
 So


we
 could
 process
 ores.
 The
 other
 kind
 of


important
 point
 is
 there
 could
 be
 well


over
 a
 thousand
 times
 the
 proven


reserves
 of
 rare
 earths
 in
 the
 existing


proven
 reserve
 catalog
 using
 new


discovery
 techniques.
 So
 USGS,
 the


geological
 survey
 in
 the
 United
 States


has
 this
 kind
 of
 earth
 MRI
 system
 where


they're
 trying
 to
 do
 new
 mapping.
 But


there's
 also
 several
 private
 companies


that
 can
 use
 radar
 and
 microwave
 imaging


and
 then
 you
 can
 use
 the
 system
 of


interferometry
 where
 you
 actually
 put


multiple
 beams
 down
 underground
 and
 you


can
 get
 a
 better
 read
 or
 a
 better


understanding
 of
 where
 these
 ores
 might


lie.
 And
 there
 are
 unproven
 reserves
 in


Texas,
 in
 Wyoming,
 in
 Colorado,
 in


Missouri,
 all
 over
 the
 continental


United
 States.
 So
 if
 we
 did
 decide,
 hey,


this
 is
 strategic
 to
 us,
 I
 do
 think
 one


of
 the
 important
 points
 is
 that
 we
 could


unlock
 both
 new
 kind
 of
 discoveries
 and


new
 refinement
 systems
 in
 the
 United


States
 and
 actually
 be
 truly
 competitive


with
 China
 if
 we
 put
 the
 will
 behind
 it.


So
 I
 think
 like
 this
 is
 a
 good
 moment


for
 the
 United
 States
 to
 observe
 what's


going
 on
 and
 not
 just
 kind
 of
 be,
 you


know,
 focused
 on
 China's
 production.
 I


think
 we
 could
 outpace
 them
 and
 and
 um


and
 accelerate
 through
 this
 if
 we
 chose


to.
 So,
 Saxs,
 where
 does
 all
 of
 this
 fit


in
 to
 the
 broader
 agreement?
 And
 do
 you


think
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 South


Korea
 and
 come
 out
 with
 a
 deal?
 And
 do


do
 you
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 like
 what
 the


contours
 have
 to
 be
 to
 make
 this
 a


success?


>> Well,
 the
 Treasury
 Secretary,
 Scott


Besson,
 who
 we
 know,
 just
 said
 that
 the


Trump
 meeting
 is
 still
 on
 track
 and
 he


also
 said
 that
 we
 have
 substantially


deescalated
 and
 that
 the
 100%
 tariff


does
 not
 need
 to
 happen.
 So,
 he
 says


it's
 still
 on
 track.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 think


he's
 doing
 a
 phenomenal
 job
 here.
 he


really
 understands
 the
 intricacies
 of


this
 trade
 relationship
 and
 I
 think
 he's


capable
 of
 both
 applying
 pressure
 but


then
 also
 finesse.
 So
 I
 think
 he's
 doing


a
 great
 job
 on
 this.
 But
 in
 any
 event,
 I


think
 the
 reason
 why
 you
 want
 to
 have


the
 leaders
 meet,
 President
 Trump
 and


President
 Xi,
 is
 that
 I
 think
 that
 this


relationship,
 this
 bilateral


relationship
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China


will
 work
 best
 when
 there's
 an
 agreement


at
 the
 top.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is


that
 when
 you
 just
 let
 the
 various


bureaucracies
 deal
 with
 each
 other,


you're
 more
 likely
 to
 have


misunderstandings
 or
 or
 food
 fights.
 So


let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 Over
 the


past
 few
 weeks,
 obviously
 you've
 had


this
 Chinese
 Ministry
 of
 Commerce
 passed


these
 export
 controls
 on
 the
 rare
 earth


which
 created
 the
 possibility
 of
 greatly


limiting
 the
 access
 of
 not
 just
 American


companies
 but
 companies
 all
 over
 the


world
 to
 Chinese
 rare
 earths.
 They've


sort
 of
 backed
 away
 from
 that.


Separately
 in
 the
 US,
 you
 had
 movements


by
 our
 government
 to
 greatly
 expand
 the


export
 control
 list.
 And
 basically,


there
 was
 a
 interim
 final
 rule
 that
 was


issued
 by
 the
 commerce
 department
 on


September
 29th
 that
 said
 that
 if
 a


Chinese
 company
 is
 on
 the
 export
 control


list,
 that
 restriction
 should
 also
 apply


to
 any
 of
 its
 affiliates
 or
 subsidiaries


that
 are
 more
 than
 50%
 owned
 by
 that


company,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 obvious,


right?
 You
 don't
 want
 a
 Chinese
 company


like
 Huawei
 to
 circumvent
 the
 entity


list
 by
 simply
 setting
 up
 a
 shell


organization.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


perfectly
 reasonable
 rule
 to
 issue,
 but


then
 China
 reacted
 to
 that
 very


strongly.
 And
 so
 there's
 just
 such
 a


high
 chance
 of
 the
 two
 sides


miscommunicating
 with
 each
 other
 and


over
 escalating
 when
 you
 just
 allow
 the


bureaucracies
 to
 talk
 to
 each
 other.
 And


I
 think
 what's
 most
 needed
 right
 now
 is


to
 have
 a
 grand
 bargain
 between


President
 Trump
 and
 President
 Xi.
 And


that
 will
 then
 calm
 down
 the


relationship.
 And
 obviously
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 competitive


relationship
 for
 as
 far
 as
 the
 I
 can
 see


because
 there's
 both
 security
 and


economic
 competition
 going
 on.
 But
 I
 do


think
 that
 when
 you
 have
 an


understanding
 at
 the
 top,
 it
 creates


conditions
 for
 more
 stability.


>> All
 right.
 Traders
 on
 poly
 market
 think


or
 know
 depending
 on
 the
 situation
 that


we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 cooler
 heads


prevail.
 15%
 chance
 of
 the
 100%
 tariff


on
 China
 going
 into
 effect
 by
 November


1st.
 In
 other
 words,
 85%
 chance
 it's
 not


going
 to
 happen.
 73%
 chance
 of
 USChina


trade
 agreement
 by
 November
 10th.


>> Who
 do
 you
 think
 has
 the
 greatest


incentive
 to
 decouple?


The
 US
 or
 China?


>> I
 think
 both
 sides
 understand
 that
 they


can
 no
 longer
 be
 dependent
 on
 the
 other


for
 things
 that
 they
 consider
 to
 be


critical.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 the
 US
 has


realized,
 wait
 a
 second,
 we
 can't
 allow


China
 to
 have
 a
 monopoly
 on
 rare
 earths.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 not
 just
 the
 the


rare
 earth,
 the
 processing,
 it's
 also


the
 casting
 of
 the
 rare
 earth
 into


magnets.
 So
 there's
 this
 long
 tale
 of
 I


don't
 know
 20,000
 different
 kinds
 of


magnets
 that
 are
 made
 from
 rare
 earth


that
 are
 used
 in
 the
 industrial
 supply


chain.
 And
 if
 China
 were
 to
 cut
 those


off,
 then
 it
 would
 greatly
 impede


manufacturing
 of
 pretty
 much
 every


different
 kind
 of
 electric
 motors
 from


cars
 to
 other
 goods.
 So
 in
 any
 event,
 my


point
 is
 just
 the
 US
 clearly
 cannot
 be


dependent.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 China
 is


reaching
 a
 similar
 conclusion.
 That


doesn't
 mean
 that
 trade
 can't
 happen


between
 the
 two
 countries.
 I'm
 sure
 it


will
 continue.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 either


side
 wants
 to
 be
 in
 a
 position
 where
 the


other
 side
 can
 use
 its
 leverage
 beyond


just
 economic
 terms
 into
 geopolitics.


But
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 belt
 and
 roads


initiative,
 like
 don't
 you
 think
 China's


been
 planning
 for
 the
 decoupling
 in
 kind


of
 a
 very
 long
 viewed
 way
 relative
 to


the
 United
 States
 and
 they're
 more
 I


would
 say
 prepared
 and
 active
 to
 execute


the
 decoupling
 whereas
 the
 US
 still
 is


waking
 up
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 are


certain
 kind
 of
 critical
 supply
 chain


dependencies
 that
 we
 have
 with
 China
 and


maybe
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 decoupling
 as


quickly
 as
 we
 stated
 our
 intention
 to.


Like
 it
 feels
 like
 they're
 in
 a
 pretty


advantaged
 position.
 Sachs
 and
 both
 the


buy
 side
 and
 the
 sell
 side.


>> They
 have
 20%
 youth
 unemployment.
 They


have
 a
 demographic
 time
 bomb
 that's
 gone


off.
 They
 have
 a
 pretty
 morabund
 real


estate
 market.
 They
 have
 very
 little
 to


none
 foreign
 direct
 investment.
 So
 I


don't
 agree
 with
 you.


>> Okay.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 would
 just
 say
 that
 I
 think


what
 China
 has
 been
 doing


>> meaning
 they're
 they're
 just
 as


challenged
 as
 we
 are.
 They
 have


different
 challenges.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 good
 it's
 a
 good
 point.


Yeah.


>> I
 would
 just
 say
 that
 I
 think
 that
 China


is
 a
 rising
 great
 power.
 I
 think
 that


over
 the
 last
 decade
 their
 economy
 grew


to
 the
 point
 where
 it's
 roughly
 the
 size


of
 the
 US's
 economy.
 Certainly
 on
 a
 on
 a


PPP
 basis,
 it
 might
 even
 be
 bigger,


>> right?


>> But
 on
 an
 international
 currency
 basis,


it's
 still
 smaller.
 But
 anyway,
 the


point
 being
 that
 as
 China
 has
 risen
 as
 a


great
 power,
 it
 sought
 to
 create
 its
 own


international
 institutions.
 And
 so
 if


you
 think
 about,
 you
 know,
 what
 the
 US


has,
 the
 US
 has
 NATO
 obviously
 and
 the


G7
 and
 the
 World
 Bank
 and
 the
 IMF
 and


all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 And
 what
 China


has
 sought
 to
 do
 is
 create,
 you
 know,


they
 created
 the
 Shanghai
 Cooperation


Organization,
 which
 is
 a
 security


focused
 organization.
 I
 wouldn't
 call
 it


quite
 the
 equivalent
 to
 NATO,
 but
 it's


trending
 in
 that
 direction.
 They've
 been


probably
 the
 main
 sponsor
 behind
 bricks


and
 Belt
 and
 Road,
 I
 think,
 is
 part
 of


that.
 They're
 creating
 their
 own
 network


of
 relationships.
 are
 creating
 their
 own


international
 order
 and
 it
 is
 a


challenge
 to
 the
 US
 order.
 I
 mean
 during


the
 unipolar
 moment
 from
 say
 1991
 to
 I


don't know
 2017
 the
 US
 was
 the
 only


great
 power
 in
 the
 system
 and
 we


basically
 defined
 all
 the
 key


international
 institutions
 and
 China
 as


it's
 risen
 has
 done
 what
 all
 great


powers
 seek
 to
 do
 which
 is
 to
 create


their
 own
 order
 and
 so
 yeah
 I
 think
 they


do
 want
 to
 be
 somewhat
 independent
 of


the
 US
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 dependent


on
 us
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 realizing
 that


we
 have
 to
 act
 the
 same
 way
 and
 the


shame
 of
 it
 is
 that
 when
 we
 were
 running


all
 the
 key
 institutions
 during
 the


unipolar
 moment
 like
 the
 WTO.
 We
 engaged


in
 so
 many
 foolish
 policies
 that
 allowed


China
 to
 dominate
 rare
 earths.
 I
 mean
 we


should
 never
 have
 let
 that
 happen.


>> Can
 I
 clarify
 one
 thing
 which
 is
 I
 think


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 know
 this


historical
 artifact
 which
 I
 think
 is
 so


fascinating
 which
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 China


is
 a
 rising
 power.
 I
 think
 China
 is
 a


reasscending
 power.
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 say


that
 is
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 1500
 to
 now,


over
 all
 of
 those
 years,
 China
 had
 the


world's
 largest
 GDP
 70%
 of
 those
 years.


>> 70%.


So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 in
 that


context,
 especially
 as
 a
 Confucian


society,
 I
 think
 the
 Chinese
 think
 about


this
 as
 hold
 on,
 this
 is
 reasserting
 the


dominance
 that
 we've
 always
 had.
 And
 I


think
 if
 you
 start
 to
 look
 at
 it
 through


that
 lens,
 that's
 why
 they
 view
 the


blending
 of
 public
 private
 partnerships,


the
 organizations
 that
 go
 and
 help
 backs


stop
 private
 companies
 in
 China.
 The


other
 interesting
 thing
 which
 I
 learned


studying
 China
 is
 how
 they
 allocate


capital.
 The
 capital
 allocation
 system


is
 both
 rigid,
 but
 it's
 incredibly


flexible.
 What
 do
 I
 mean?
 The
 way
 that


China
 allocates
 money
 is
 the
 following.


You
 have
 Xi
 Jinping
 and
 his
 close
 circle


of
 people.
 They
 dictate
 the
 priorities,


right?
 I
 think
 there
 was
 an
 article,


Nick,
 you
 can
 find
 it.
 But
 Xi
 is


personally
 right
 now
 helping
 to
 draft


the
 five-year
 business
 plan
 of
 China.


But
 what
 happens
 is
 is
 it
 goes
 from
 that


central
 group
 of
 like
 7
 8
 n
 people
 to


the
 pala
 bureau.
 And
 when
 it
 gets


approved
 by
 the
 pala
 bureau,
 it
 gets


sent
 to
 all
 the
 provinces
 and
 then
 it


gets
 sent
 to
 the
 prefectures.
 So
 an


example
 was
 in
 2006
 and
 7
 when
 they


decided
 to
 prioritize
 EVs.
 What
 you


effectively
 have
 is
 a
 cascading
 set
 of


venture
 capitalists
 who
 are
 operating


against
 a
 national
 priority
 and
 then


they
 are
 rewarded
 for
 it.
 And
 so
 you


essentially
 have
 300
 VCs
 running
 around


organizing
 human
 capital
 in
 all
 of
 these


different
 provinces
 against
 all
 of
 these


different
 priorities.
 And
 at
 the
 end
 of


that
 you
 get
 a
 BYD
 or
 you
 get
 a
 Xiaomi


or
 you
 get
 these
 great
 companies.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that
 is
 what's
 so
 daunting
 if


you
 think
 about
 it.
 So
 that's
 another


thing
 that
 we
 have
 to
 factor
 as
 well.


They
 have


>> and
 they
 have
 they
 have
 one
 of
 those


plans
 Jamoth
 for
 every
 industry
 not
 just


so
 they
 have
 like
 an
 agriculture


five-year
 plan.
 They
 have an
 energy


5-year
 plan
 and
 in
 each
 one
 it
 details


out
 their
 forecast
 of
 not
 just
 like
 how


to
 catch
 up
 but
 what's
 possible
 and


that's
 why
 they're
 charting
 new
 new


avenues
 of
 innovation
 in
 nuclear
 power.


Yeah.
 It's
 about
 them,
 I
 think,
 getting


back
 to
 where
 they
 have
 been
 as
 opposed


to
 them
 realizing


that
 they
 could
 potentially
 be
 the


world's
 largest
 economy.
 It's
 more
 them


saying,
 "We
 were
 the
 largest
 for
 so


long.
 We
 took
 our
 eye
 off
 the
 ball
 and


now
 we
 need
 to
 get
 refocused."
 I
 think


that's
 more
 of
 a
 national
 pride
 kind
 of


motivation
 here.
 But
 it's
 obviously


different
 people,
 different
 country,


different
 governing
 structure,
 etc.


>> Isn't
 that
 incredible
 though?
 70%
 of
 the


year
 since
 1500
 they
 had
 the
 largest
 GDP


in
 the
 world.


>> It
 is
 incredible.


>> It's
 stunning.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 there
 were
 these


innovations
 that
 drove
 some
 of
 these


ships.
 The
 technology
 of
 ships
 and


fleets
 of
 ships
 drove
 the
 Dutch
 Empire


to
 its
 prowess
 and
 then
 the
 British


Empire
 to
 its
 prowess.
 And
 there
 were


these
 moments
 of
 technological


innovation.
 But
 you're
 right,
 always
 on


the
 heels
 was
 China.
 And
 this
 may
 be


China's
 moment
 of
 resurgence
 across
 the


board.


>> The
 person
 who
 really
 saw
 this
 ahead
 of


the
 curve
 was
 Lee
 Kuan
 Yu
 from


Singapore.
 basically
 the
 founder
 of


Singapore


>> and
 Graham
 Allison
 wrote
 a
 book
 about


Lee
 Kuan
 Yu
 where
 he
 talks
 about
 his


insights
 and
 there's
 a
 couple
 of
 quotes


here
 that
 I
 think
 are
 are
 really
 good
 on


this.
 What
 Lee
 Kuanu
 said
 is
 that
 it's


not
 possible
 to
 pretend
 that
 this
 China


is
 just
 another
 big
 player.
 This
 is
 the


biggest
 player
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the


world
 and
 he
 also
 said
 that
 the
 size
 of


China's
 displacement
 of
 the
 world


balance
 is
 such
 that
 the
 world
 must
 find


a
 new
 balance.
 So


Jamath,
 like
 you're
 saying,
 China
 was


the
 biggest
 power
 in
 the
 world
 for


hundreds
 of
 years
 and
 then
 it
 was
 kind


of
 overtaken
 by
 the
 the
 western
 powers


and
 now
 it's
 kind
 of
 reasserting
 itself.


But
 in
 any
 event,
 this
 is
 why
 I
 think


that
 during
 the
 unipolar
 moment,
 the
 US


should
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 more
 careful


about
 facilitating
 China's
 rise


>> because
 we
 created
 a
 monster.
 And
 this


is
 the
 point
 that


>> professor
 Mirshimer
 has
 made
 many
 times


and
 he
 wrote
 about
 this
 going
 back
 to


2002
 saying
 in
 his
 article
 about
 whether


China
 could
 rise
 peacefully
 and
 he
 said


the
 answer
 is
 no
 because
 if
 we


facilitate
 their
 rise
 we
 will
 create
 a


geopolitical
 competitor
 and
 we'll
 go


from
 being
 a
 unipolar
 world
 order
 to
 a


multipolar
 world
 order
 and
 that's


basically
 what's
 happened.
 But
 at
 the


time,
 just
 remember
 like
 when
 when
 they


were
 admitted
 to
 the
 WTO
 and
 the


motivation
 was
 really
 about
 lowering
 the


cost
 of
 goods
 and
 services
 for
 the


American
 consumer,
 which
 was
 like
 an


intrinsically
 reasonable
 motivation.
 It


wasn't
 like
 there
 was
 some
 nefarious


intention
 at
 the
 time,
 but
 it
 was


shortsighted
 in
 that
 it
 didn't
 do
 the


calculus.
 Fast
 forward
 20,
 30,
 40
 years


to
 determine,
 well,
 if
 we
 then
 kneecap


our
 ability
 to
 actually
 produce


anything,
 where
 are
 we
 going
 to
 be
 if


they
 do
 start
 to
 decouple?
 That's


>> it
 was
 hubris
 though.
 It
 was
 hubus


because
 we
 thought
 that
 there
 was
 only


one
 great
 power
 in
 the
 system
 and
 that's


the
 way
 it
 would
 always
 be.
 We
 thought


great
 power
 politics
 was
 off
 the
 table


and
 we
 thought
 that
 we
 were
 at
 the
 end


of
 history.


>> It
 wasn't
 hubris,
 it
 was
 greed.
 the
 the


CEOs
 at
 the
 time
 and
 the
 people
 who
 were


influential
 in
 making
 donations
 to


politicians
 wanted
 to
 make
 more
 money.


That's
 why
 they
 did
 it.
 They
 didn't
 do


it
 with
 anything
 other
 than
 a
 profit


motivation,
 which
 is
 greed.


>> Part
 of
 American
 like
 mindset
 at
 the


time
 was
 that
 we
 had
 a
 monopoly
 on


knowledge
 work,
 right?
 And
 this
 was
 I


think
 very
 key.
 This
 this
 speaks
 to
 the


hubris
 of
 the
 decision-m
 was
 that
 this


knowledge
 work
 is
 where
 you
 create
 a


separation
 of
 labor
 from
 intellect.
 and


that
 there
 was
 this
 idea
 that
 America


would
 move
 into
 a
 services
 economy
 fully


and
 not
 have
 to
 be
 in
 a
 labor
 economy


and
 the
 labor
 economy
 could
 be


outsourced.


Ultimately,
 that
 didn't
 yield
 true.
 The


the
 internet
 kind
 of
 created
 a
 rival
 to


knowledge
 work
 or
 a
 diffusion
 of


knowledge
 and
 diffusion
 of
 knowledge


capacity
 to
 societies
 around
 the
 world,


which
 really
 did
 create
 a
 different


structure
 than
 we
 anticipated
 at
 the


time.


>> I
 think
 that's
 looking
 in
 the
 rearview


mirror,
 Freeberg.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 CEOs


at
 that
 time
 were
 like
 how
 do
 we


increase
 the
 profit
 margin
 on
 an
 iPhone


on
 a
 a
 PC
 on
 any
 product
 being
 created


and
 the
 way
 to
 do that
 is
 find
 the


lowest
 I


>> labor
 source
 possible
 and
 that
 was
 China


they
 just
 did
 it
 out
 of
 just
 pure


>> so
 that
 was
 part
 of
 it
 but
 there
 was


another
 factor
 here
 as
 well
 which
 I
 I
 do


think
 the
 ideology
 was
 really
 powerful


and
 remember
 in
 the
 1990s
 the
 leading


philosopher
 or
 international
 relations


theorist
 the
 most
 celebrated
 book
 was


the
 end
 of
 history
 by
 Francis
 Fukyama


and
 what
 he
 basically
 said
 is
 that
 we're


at
 the
 end
 of
 history
 because
 liberal


democracy
 has
 won
 and
 it's
 only
 a
 matter


of
 time
 before
 the
 whole
 world
 becomes


liberal
 democracies.
 And
 the
 theory


about
 China
 was
 that
 if
 they
 got
 rich,


they
 had
 become
 more
 like
 us,
 that


people
 would
 rise
 up
 and
 demand
 a


liberal
 democratic
 government
 as
 they


became
 rich.
 And
 so
 we
 then
 justified,


and
 there
 probably
 was
 an
 element
 of


greed
 to
 this
 as
 well,
 we
 then
 justified


helping
 China
 rise
 on
 the
 grounds
 that


somehow
 this
 wealth
 would
 turn
 him
 into


a
 democracy.
 And
 in
 fact,
 all
 that
 it


did
 was
 make
 them
 richer
 and
 more


powerful.
 It
 didn't
 change
 their


government.
 It
 just
 turned
 them
 into
 a


huge
 geopolitical
 competitor
 to
 the
 US.


The
 author
 who
 actually
 predicted
 this


and
 well
 there's
 Mir
 Shimemer
 who


predicted
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 also
 Samuel


Huntington
 wrote
 a
 book


>> called
 the
 Clash
 of
 Civilizations
 in
 the


mid
 '90s
 that
 was
 sort
 of
 the
 opposite


of
 end
 of
 you
 know
 end
 of
 history
 was


celebrated.
 Clash
 of
 Civilizations
 was


sort
 of
 reviled.
 But
 what
 Huntington


said
 is
 that
 what
 these
 other


civilizations
 want
 around
 the
 world
 is


not
 westernization.
 They
 want


modernization.


And
 as
 they
 modernize
 and
 become
 richer,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 basically


westernize.
 They're
 going
 to
 become


competitors
 to
 the
 western
 order.
 And


that's
 basically
 what
 happened.


>> I
 thought
 for
 sure
 you
 were
 going
 to
 say


Freriedman's
 the
 world
 is
 flat,
 which


was
 I
 think
 air
 cover
 for
 all
 this


because
 you
 would
 get
 the
 peace
 dividend


if
 everybody
 had
 McDonald's
 and


everybody
 was
 watching
 the
 same
 movies.


Go
 ahead,
 Shimat.
 You
 have
 some


thoughts.


>> That
 Huntington
 book
 is
 actually


exceptional.
 The
 thing
 with
 Francis


Fukuyama
 is
 he
 he
 writes
 in
 this


beautiful
 way,
 but
 he
 literally
 bats


zero.
 It's
 like
 you
 could
 basically
 read


a
 Francis
 Fukuyama
 book
 and
 understand


that
 whatever
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 he


wrote
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 happen.
 That


anyway,
 that's
 neither
 here
 nor
 there.


But
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 pick
 on
 what
 Jason


said
 because
 I
 agree
 with
 him.
 The
 thing


is
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 geopolitical


tension
 sacks
 which
 I
 think
 you


articulated
 it
 well
 like
 the
 elites
 were


coming
 together
 like
 we're
 going
 to


convert
 China
 we're
 going to
 do
 all
 of


this
 stuff
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 trend


but
 then
 what
 hyperacelerated
 it
 in
 my


opinion
 was
 something
 that
 was
 very


tactical
 which
 Jay
 Cal
 mentioned
 which


is
 the
 compensation
 plans
 of
 most
 of
 the


executives
 and
 CEOs
 of
 these
 public


corporations
 started
 to
 get
 very
 tuned


to
 gameable
 metrics
 like
 EPS
 in
 and


around
 that
 same
 time.
 And
 so
 Jason's


right,
 the
 direct
 financial
 incentives


to
 basically
 think
 about
 this
 as
 a


monocultural
 global
 world
 where
 you
 can


just
 export
 things
 to
 every
 nook
 and


cranny
 of
 the
 world
 to
 optimize
 for
 the


flow
 of
 profits
 back
 to
 you,
 trap
 them


in
 any
 country
 you
 want
 because
 it


doesn't
 ultimately
 matter
 to
 your


compensation.


That
 perversion
 also
 happened
 at
 the


same
 time
 which
 I
 think
 accelerated
 what


otherwise
 would
 have
 given
 us
 maybe


another
 decade
 or
 two
 to
 realize
 that
 we


weren't
 in
 complete
 control
 of
 our


destiny.


>> So
 it
 gets
 um
 you
 can
 see
 it
 also
 in


Taiwan
 with
 like
 how
 in
 the
 world
 did


90%
 of
 the
 chips
 come
 out
 of
 one
 tiny


island?
 It's
 just
 capitalism
 like
 it's


the
 best
 place
 to
 do
 it
 at
 the
 cheapest


price,
 the
 most
 efficiently.
 And
 then


you
 have
 now
 this
 dependency
 on
 Taiwan


because
 we
 didn't
 think
 about
 redundancy


and
 supply
 chain.
 Freeberg,
 in
 related


international
 news,
 Trump
 is
 put
 up
 or


the
 Trump
 administration
 has
 put
 up


about
 $40
 billion
 to
 help
 out
 Argentina.


Can
 you
 explain
 what's
 going
 on
 there?


>> They're
 trying
 to
 bolster
 the
 credit


rating
 of
 Argentina
 with
 the
 currency


swap
 that's
 related
 to
 the
 financial


condition
 the
 promise
 proponents
 would


argue
 he
 inherited.
 the
 opponents
 would


say,
 you
 know,
 he's
 making
 things
 worse.


The
 US
 is
 stepping
 in
 to
 support
 his


free
 market
 kind
 of
 principles
 that
 are


ultimately
 going
 to
 drive
 crossber


cooperation.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 swap


agreement
 puts
 in
 place
 a
 bolstering
 of


support.
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 related


directly
 to
 the
 to
 rare
 earths


>> to
 rare
 earths.
 I
 I'm
 not
 sure
 about


rare
 earth.
 All right,
 Jamal.
 Uh
 I
 saw


you
 retweeting
 some
 of
 this
 and
 there's


been
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 back
 channel
 in


the
 last
 48
 hours.
 Kind
 of
 breaking
 news


here.
 data
 centers
 are
 spiking
 the
 cost


of
 energy
 or
 people
 are
 perceiving
 it
 to


be
 doing
 so
 in
 different
 geographies


here
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 I
 guess


not
 wanting
 to
 be
 hated
 or
 get
 into
 wars


with
 consumers
 some
 big
 tech
 companies


are
 standing
 down
 plans
 explain
 what's


going
 on
 here
 Chimathan
 if
 this
 is
 a


trend
 yet


>> I
 put
 this
 out
 there
 when
 I
 wrote
 that


because
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 this
 is
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 trend.
 Just
 to
 be
 very


specific,
 Google
 was
 planning
 a
 $1


billion
 spend
 on
 a
 data
 center
 in


Indianapolis
 County
 or
 Indianapolis.
 And


essentially
 what
 happened
 was
 there
 was


enough
 push
 back
 that
 it
 looked
 like
 if


it
 went
 to
 vote
 in
 the
 city
 council,


they
 would
 have
 voted
 against
 the


approval
 of
 the
 data
 center,
 against
 the


the
 necessary
 zoning
 and
 other


regulatory
 approvals.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 to


avoid
 what
 would
 have
 been
 an
 awkward


press
 cycle,
 Google
 just
 pulled
 it
 and


said,
 "Don't
 worry,
 we're
 not
 going
 to


do
 this
 here."
 And
 so
 that
 in
 and
 of


itself
 I
 think
 is
 an
 isolated
 incident


except
 that
 in
 this
 same
 week
 it


happened
 two
 other
 times


>> in
 Wisconsin
 there
 was
 a
 proposal
 very


similar
 to
 Google's
 but
 this
 time
 from


Microsoft
 where
 again
 those
 local


residents
 got
 pretty
 upset
 and
 in
 the


11th
 hour
 Microsoft
 pulled
 it
 and
 then


in
 the
 third
 example
 there
 was
 an


attempt
 by
 an
 Amazon
 data
 center
 to
 get


built
 near
 Tucson.
 That
 I
 think
 also
 was


mothballled.
 So
 why
 is
 this
 happening?


When
 I
 tweeted
 this
 out
 or
 when
 I
 posted


it
 rather,
 the
 comments
 were
 pretty


instructive.
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are


three
 things
 that
 I
 took
 away
 from
 it.


Thing
 number
 one
 is
 that
 people
 are


seeing
 their
 prices
 of
 electricity
 go
 up


in
 the
 local
 areas
 where
 the
 data


centers
 are
 being
 built.


The
 second
 is
 that
 people
 are
 worried


about
 the
 water
 consumption
 of
 these


data
 centers
 and
 the
 cost
 of
 water
 and


the
 access
 to
 clean
 water
 and
 that
 the


plans
 to
 be
 netneutral
 on
 water


consumption
 may
 or
 may
 not
 be
 real.
 So


there's
 a
 concern
 there.
 And
 then
 the


third
 that
 many
 of
 the
 people
 commented


was
 about
 the
 actual
 noise
 pollution


that
 it
 was
 creating.
 But
 I
 I
 took
 a


step
 back
 from
 this
 and
 my
 thought
 is


very
 simple,
 which
 is
 it
 actually
 speaks


to
 one
 of
 three
 very
 important


inflection
 points
 that
 we're
 dealing


with
 on
 the
 AI
 side,
 right?
 So
 one
 of


them
 we
 talked
 about
 last
 week,
 which
 is


you
 can't
 have
 50
 state
 laws,
 right?
 It


needs
 to
 come
 from
 the
 federal


government
 so
 that
 there's
 one
 set
 of


regulation
 and
 that
 there's
 clarity.
 So


effectively
 what
 Sax
 has
 been
 able
 to


execute
 on
 the
 crypto
 side,
 I
 think
 his


intention
 is
 to
 try
 to
 do
 this
 on
 the
 AI


side
 and
 I
 think
 the
 federal
 government


needs
 to
 be
 given
 a
 chance
 to
 do
 that.


Otherwise
 locally
 in
 the
 United
 States


the
 only
 winners
 are
 going
 to
 be
 lawyers


and
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 create
 an
 own


goal
 and
 China's
 going
 to
 win.
 Okay.


Second,
 we
 just
 talked
 about
 it
 is
 the


government
 needs
 to
 be
 the
 economic


backs
 stop
 to
 the
 US
 supply
 chain
 that


powers
 AI,
 right?
 And
 we
 talked
 about


all
 these
 things,
 the
 metals,
 the


minerals,
 the
 rare
 earths,
 so
 that
 the


tax
 that
 companies
 can
 extract
 are


mostly
 market
 driven
 and
 not


exploitative
 and
 doesn't
 create
 air


pockets
 in
 the
 funding
 cycle.
 Okay,
 so


we
 talked
 about
 that.
 But
 here's
 the


thing
 that
 nobody
 talks
 about.
 When
 you


look
 at
 these
 data
 centers,
 I
 think
 what


it's
 saying
 bottoms
 up
 is
 that
 these


hyperscalers
 need
 to
 get
 these


communities
 on
 their
 side.
 I
 think
 that


there
 is
 no
 understanding
 of
 what
 a


token
 is.
 What
 is
 a
 token?
 I
 don't
 think


if
 you
 ask
 the
 average
 person
 on
 the


street,
 they
 know
 what
 it
 is.
 What
 they


know
 is
 that
 tokens
 are
 not
 jobs.


And
 if
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 embraced
 by
 the


public,
 I
 think
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 a


better
 job
 of
 is
 to
 show
 the
 tangible


economic
 benefits,
 especially
 in
 places


like
 Wisconsin
 and
 Indiana
 that
 may
 feel


like
 they're
 missing
 out.
 So,
 we
 can't


have
 this
 narrative
 that
 AI
 may
 take


your
 job
 away
 while
 it's
 also
 doubling


your
 electricity
 price
 because
 they're


not
 feeling
 and
 seeing
 the
 abundance


that
 we
 think
 that
 it
 can
 offer.
 This
 is


exactly
 right,
 Chama.
 If
 you
 think
 about


the
 average
 American
 citizen,
 you
 know,


they
 have
 somebody
 in
 their
 family
 who


drives
 for
 Uber
 or
 Door
 Dash,
 they
 have


truck
 drivers,
 they
 have
 Amazon
 factory


workers,
 and
 all
 those
 jobs
 are
 going


away.
 It's
 just
 a
 matter
 of
 when.
 And


some
 people
 believe
 we
 can
 handle
 the


displacement,
 others
 don't.
 ahead.
 Uh,


Freeberg


>> Jal,
 my
 idea,
 just
 sorry,
 my
 idea,
 my


idea
 is
 you
 have
 to
 use
 the
 balance


sheet
 of
 these
 big
 companies,
 use
 that


free
 cash
 flow
 and
 it
 can
 act
 as
 a


cushion
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 needs
 to


happen.
 So,


>> they
 can
 pay
 higher
 tariffs
 for


electricity.


>> They
 can
 also
 just
 frankly
 go
 and
 pay


for
 some
 amount
 of
 the
 electricity
 bill


of
 these
 local
 folks.
 They
 could
 pay
 for


solar
 and
 storage
 if
 they
 wanted
 to.


There's
 a
 plethora
 of
 ideas
 here
 where


they
 probably
 are
 going
 to
 need
 to
 step


into
 market
 to
 get
 folks
 on
 their
 side


and
 I
 think
 they
 have
 to
 do
 it.
 It's


interesting
 you
 mentioned
 that
 because
 I


just
 had
 Zack
 Dell
 from
 Base
 Power
 on


this
 week
 in
 Startups
 last
 week
 and
 what


they
 do
 is
 they
 put
 batteries
 on
 the


side
 of
 your
 house
 outside
 their
 square


ones
 so
 they're
 not
 as
 felt
 as


industrial
 like
 industrial
 ones
 and
 then


they
 will
 fill
 those
 batteries
 when
 the


uh
 electricity
 is
 cheap.
 They'll
 deploy


it
 when
 it's
 expensive.
 They
 get
 the


arbitrage


>> and
 I
 said
 to
 him
 on
 the
 show
 like
 it's


only
 they
 only
 charge
 consumers
 I
 think


$500
 or
 $1,000
 to
 install
 it
 just
 so


they
 have
 some
 skin
 in
 the
 game.
 you


don't
 have
 to
 rip
 your
 roof
 apart
 and


put
 solar
 on.
 It's
 just
 batteries.
 And


they
 said,
 "Well,
 why
 don't
 you
 do
 that


and
 like
 do
 an
 entire
 neighborhood?
 Like


when
 they
 build
 these
 3,000
 home
 infill


neighborhoods,
 why
 don't
 you
 put
 them
 on


every
 single
 one
 and
 then
 create
 a


network
 for
 data
 centers?"
 And
 he
 said,


"Stand
 by.
 That's
 what
 exactly
 what


we're
 working
 on."
 So
 it
 kind
 of


combines
 your
 idea.
 Saxs,
 you're
 the


zar.
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on
 what


Chimath
 points
 out
 is
 which
 is
 the


average
 working
 American
 and
 their


perception
 of
 AI?
 You
 have
 job
 loss,
 you


have
 electric
 bills
 going
 up,
 and
 then


you
 have,
 hey,
 fake
 news,
 the
 reality,


is
 this
 real
 or
 not?
 These
 sora
 slop


videos
 I'm
 seeing,
 it
 feels
 like
 there's


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 trend
 towards
 um
 a


negative
 framing
 of
 the
 AI
 innovation


and
 maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 help
 the


bottom
 half
 of
 society.
 Uh,
 are
 you


seeing
 that?
 Do
 you
 believe
 it?
 And
 do


you
 have
 plans
 to
 counter
 it?


>> Well,
 what
 I
 see
 is
 that
 we
 just
 came


off
 a
 quarter
 of
 3.8%
 economic
 growth,


of
 which
 40%
 was
 attributable
 to
 AI.
 So,


in
 other
 words,
 if
 we
 didn't
 have
 this


AI
 boom
 going
 on,
 by
 my
 math,
 our
 GDP


growth
 rate
 in
 Q2
 would
 have
 been
 2.3%


instead
 of
 3.8%.


So
 AI
 is
 the
 difference
 between
 having


great
 GDP
 growth,
 say
 around
 4%.
 And


modest
 GDP
 growth
 around
 2%.
 So
 it
 seems


to
 me
 that
 everyone
 who
 wants
 to
 have
 a


great
 economy
 should
 be
 supportive
 of


this
 AI
 boom
 that's
 happening.
 The
 job


loss
 narrative
 is
 just
 that.
 It's
 just
 a


narrative.
 It's
 a
 story.
 The
 media
 loves


to
 tell
 it.
 It's
 mostly
 theoretical.


It's
 mostly
 anecdotal.
 You
 can
 point
 to


a
 few
 jobs
 here
 and
 there,
 but
 there's


no
 evidence
 of
 widespread
 job
 loss.
 This


is
 just
 something
 that
 people
 are


prognosticating
 about
 the
 future.
 And
 in


every
 previous
 technological
 revolution


that
 we've
 had,
 yes,
 the
 jobs
 have


shifted,
 but
 they've
 shifted
 from
 more


rote
 jobs
 to
 more
 sophisticated
 jobs


that
 create
 a
 higher
 standard
 of
 living


for
 everybody.
 The
 best
 example
 being


that
 in
 the
 year
 1900,
 50%
 of
 the
 US


economy
 was
 involved
 in
 agriculture.
 In


other
 words,
 one
 out
 of
 every
 two
 people


were
 farmers.
 By
 the
 year
 2000,
 that


number
 had
 dropped
 to
 2%.
 The


difference,
 the
 48%
 did
 not
 become


unemployed.
 They
 went
 off
 and
 did
 other


things.
 They
 worked
 in
 factories,
 for


example,
 and
 they
 went
 into
 the
 services


part
 of
 the
 economy.
 So
 I
 think
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 here
 is
 that
 AI
 is
 going


to
 enable
 people
 to
 shift
 their
 work
 to


more
 gratifying
 and
 less
 wrote
 parts
 of


the
 economy
 that
 will
 increase


productivity
 and
 standards
 of
 living
 for


everybody.
 Biology
 has
 a
 really
 good
 way


of
 explaining
 this
 and
 I
 think
 this
 goes


to
 the
 heart
 of
 why
 the
 job
 loss


narrative
 is
 a
 fallacy
 is
 because
 humans


are
 endto
 end.
 What
 makes
 them
 really


good
 and
 irreplaceable
 is
 that
 they
 can


do
 an
 entire
 job
 end
 to
 end
 and
 they
 can


pivot
 their
 objective
 and
 figure
 out


what
 their
 objective
 should
 be.
 AI
 is


not
 like
 that.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 told
 what
 to


do.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 prompted
 and
 then
 when


it
 gives
 you
 a
 result,
 that
 result
 has


to
 be
 validated
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 not


hallucinating.
 And
 then
 frequently
 you


don't
 really
 get
 the
 result
 you're


looking
 for.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 iterate
 and


you
 have
 to
 reprompt
 and
 you
 go
 through


this
 loop
 where
 you
 do
 it
 over
 and
 over


again
 until
 you
 get
 something
 that's


valuable.
 So
 in
 other
 words,
 humans
 do


the
 things
 at
 the
 end.
 They
 do
 the


prompting
 and
 validation.
 AI
 does
 the


stuff
 in
 the
 middle.
 So
 as
 biology
 says,


humans
 are
 end
 to
 end.
 AI
 is
 middle
 to


middle.
 This
 is
 why
 fundamentally
 I


think
 that
 AI
 and
 humans
 will
 be
 very


synergistic.
 AI
 will
 not
 be
 a


replacement
 for
 humans.
 They're
 going
 to


do
 the
 stuff
 in
 the
 middle
 that
 humans


don't
 like
 to
 do
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 allow


humans
 to
 be
 much
 more
 productive.
 So


right
 now
 I'm
 very
 optimistic
 about
 this


boom.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that
 people
 who
 are


criticizing
 it
 should
 really
 think
 about


whether
 they
 want
 the
 US
 to
 have
 2%


growth
 rates
 or
 4%
 growth
 rates
 because


that's
 what
 we're
 really
 talking
 about


here.


>> Freeberg,
 CEO
 of
 Uber
 and
 Tesla
 believe


the
 opposite.
 They
 think
 these
 driver


jobs
 are
 gone
 pretty
 quickly.
 Uh
 the


data
 showing
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 serious


problem
 right
 now
 with
 young
 people


getting
 jobs
 specifically
 because
 of
 AI.


And
 obviously
 GDP
 is
 not
 wages.
 The


people
 we're
 talking
 about
 who
 are


affected
 by
 these
 job
 losses
 don't
 own


equities.
 The
 top
 50
 55%
 of
 the
 country


own
 equities.
 So
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about


this
 narrative?
 Do
 you
 believe
 it's
 a


false
 narrative,
 a
 true
 narrative


somewhere
 in
 between?
 Okay,
 here
 here's


how
 I
 would
 think
 about
 what
 may
 happen


rather
 than
 think
 about
 someone
 quote


losing
 their
 job,
 which
 you
 know
 is
 a


term
 you
 keep
 using
 and
 others
 keep


using
 and


>> I
 think
 would
 be
 yeah


>> I
 don't
 what whatever
 it
 is
 it
 you're


you're
 acting
 like
 they're
 passively
 in


a
 victim
 state.
 We
 have
 the
 lowest


unemployment
 in
 history
 and
 there's
 an


extraordinary
 demand
 for
 new
 capacity
 of


work
 by
 humans
 to
 do
 stuff
 in
 the
 United


States
 right
 now
 because
 of
 the


extraordinary
 manufacturing
 buildout


that
 is
 underway
 driven
 largely
 by
 AI


and
 soontobe
 robotics
 and
 several
 other


industries.
 We
 just
 talked
 about
 rare


earths
 mining
 and
 processing.
 There
 are


many
 industries
 that
 are
 taking
 off
 in


this
 country
 that
 have
 not
 existed
 and


there
 is
 a
 demand
 for
 labor.
 And
 when


there's
 a
 demand
 for
 labor
 and
 there's
 a


shortage
 of
 people
 to
 do
 the
 work,
 the


employer
 typically
 says,
 "Let's
 go


recruit.
 Let's
 go
 spend.
 Let's
 go


train."
 And
 when
 you
 have
 an
 innovation


cycle
 like
 is
 underway
 right
 now,
 the


hiring
 for
 the
 new
 jobs
 happens
 before


the
 loss
 of
 the
 old
 jobs
 happens.
 So
 you


have
 to
 have
 someone
 that
 builds
 all
 the


Model
 T's
 before
 people
 stop
 becoming


horse
 buggy
 drivers.
 So
 who's
 going
 to


do
 all
 the
 Model
 T
 building?
 They're


going
 to
 get
 paid.
 they're
 going
 to
 get


offered
 money
 to
 go
 do
 those
 jobs.
 So


what
 typically
 happens
 in
 these
 cycles


is
 that
 there's
 a
 recruitment
 exercise,


a
 recruiting
 cycle
 that
 happens
 upfront.


And
 so
 rather
 than
 say
 all
 these
 drivers


are
 going
 to
 lose
 their
 jobs,
 another


way
 to
 frame
 it
 is
 that
 all
 of
 these


drivers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 offered
 new,


higher
 paying
 jobs
 before
 there's
 lower


demand
 for
 driving.
 And
 they're
 going
 to


say,
 I
 can
 go
 make
 twice
 as
 much
 money


per
 hour
 by
 going
 over
 to
 take
 this
 new


job.
 And
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 say,
 "I'd


rather
 do
 that
 than
 drive.
 I'm
 getting


paid
 twice
 as
 much
 and
 I
 get
 to
 work
 on


more
 interesting
 stuff.
 I
 like
 that."


That's
 how
 this
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 go.


That
 is
 the
 more
 positive
 view
 on
 how


what
 you're
 calling
 job
 displacement


actually
 plays
 out
 in
 the
 US
 economy
 in


the
 decade
 ahead.
 A
 recruiting
 cycle


precedes
 the
 elimination
 of
 old
 jobs


that
 aren't
 needed
 anymore.
 That


recruiting
 cycle
 is
 a
 net
 positive
 for


people.
 They
 say,
 "Wow,
 that
 is
 an


amazing
 improvement
 in
 my
 income,
 an


improvement
 in
 my
 lifestyle.
 I
 get
 to


work
 on
 more
 interesting
 things.
 My
 life


is
 better
 because
 of
 it.
 And
 then
 years


later,
 the
 demand
 for
 those
 old
 jobs


starts
 to
 die
 down,
 but
 at
 that
 point,


everyone's
 been
 recruited
 away
 anyway.


>> So,
 Freeberg,
 you
 mentioned
 the
 the


Model
 T
 putting
 all
 the
 horse
 and


buggies
 out
 of
 business.
 And
 if
 we
 had


today's
 media
 environment
 around
 back
 in


the
 days
 of
 Henry
 Ford,
 that's
 exactly


what
 they
 would
 have
 been
 bemoning
 is


that
 all
 the
 horse
 and
 buggy
 guys
 are


going
 to
 be
 put
 out
 of
 business.
 And


part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 that
 would
 have


been
 a
 very
 bad
 take
 is
 because
 it's


easy
 to
 see
 the
 people
 who
 are
 being


displaced
 in
 the
 short
 term
 like
 maybe


the
 Uber
 drivers
 or
 something
 like
 that.


But
 it's
 hard
 to
 see
 all
 the
 new


industries
 and
 all
 the
 new
 businesses


and
 all
 the
 new
 jobs
 that
 don't
 even


exist
 yet
 that
 are
 going to
 be
 created.


So
 for
 example,
 what
 were
 the
 downstream


effects
 of
 the
 Model
 T?
 Well,
 first
 of


all,
 it
 created
 this
 new
 kind
 of


industrial
 assembly
 line
 which
 applied


not
 just
 to
 cars
 but
 to
 all
 sorts
 of


goods.
 I
 mean
 Henry
 Ford
 pioneered
 that


and
 that
 had
 huge
 ramifications
 for
 the


US
 becoming
 the
 industrial
 power
 that
 it


ultimately
 became
 which
 led
 it
 to


winning
 World
 War
 II.
 Then
 just
 in
 terms


of
 the
 car,
 you
 had
 things
 like
 the


build
 out
 of
 the
 interstate
 highway


system,


>> the
 tire
 industry.


>> Yeah.
 that
 just
 about
 the
 highways
 that


led
 to


>> to
 Holiday
 Inn
 and
 hotels
 and
 motel
 and


drive-through
 windows
 and
 McDonald's
 and


car
 culture


>> and


>> and
 the
 taxi
 cab
 industry
 itself


emerged.


>> George
 Lucas
 got
 his
 start
 as
 a
 director


by
 making
 the
 film
 American
 Graffiti


which
 was
 all
 about
 car
 culture
 in
 the


1950s.
 So
 that
 led
 to
 Star
 Wars.
 I
 mean,


there's
 all
 these
 butterfly
 effects
 of


the
 Model
 T
 being
 invented,
 which
 are


absolutely
 massive.
 And
 it
 would
 have


been
 impossible
 to
 foresee
 all
 of
 that


stuff
 a
 hundred
 years
 ago.
 When
 you
 have


these
 new
 industrial
 revolutions
 or


these
 new
 technological
 revolutions,


it's
 going
 to
 increase
 the
 capacity
 of


humans
 to
 design
 all
 sorts
 of
 new


products,
 create
 all
 sorts
 of
 new


businesses.
 And
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 that


this
 lump
 of
 labor
 fallacy
 that
 you
 have


all
 these
 humans
 that
 we
 don't
 know
 what


to
 do
 with
 so
 you
 have
 to
 just
 keep
 them


busy
 has
 always
 proven
 to
 be
 a
 fallacy


throughout
 human
 history.


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 those
 buggy
 drivers
 did


not
 ch
 did
 not
 lose
 their
 jobs.
 They


chose
 to
 go
 into
 one
 of
 these
 new


industries
 where
 they
 were
 offered
 more


money.


>> I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 the
 issue
 at
 all.


I
 would
 say
 that
 when
 you
 look
 at


Arizona,
 Indiana,
 and
 Wisconsin,
 what


you
 are
 looking
 at
 are
 people
 whose
 jobs


are
 not
 at
 risk
 today,
 tomorrow
 or
 the


next
 day
 because
 of
 AI.
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 what
 it
 is.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 they


probably
 on
 the
 margins
 benefit.
 The


question
 is
 more
 how
 are
 they
 getting


information
 and
 how
 are
 they
 processing


their
 point
 of
 view
 so
 that
 they
 show
 up


to
 these
 local
 municipality
 meetings
 and


essentially
 cancel
 progress.
 That
 is
 a


very
 important
 thing
 to
 diagnose
 because


it
 is
 not
 isolated.
 So
 I'm
 trying
 to
 ask


the
 question
 which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 more


practical
 and
 important
 one
 is
 what
 do


we
 do
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 narrative


and
 the
 facts
 are
 clear
 because
 right


now
 you're
 seeing
 very
 different
 and


diverse
 pockets
 of
 people
 in
 largely


purple
 and
 then
 some
 red
 states
 voting


against
 the
 exact
 things
 we
 need
 to


bring
 this
 abundance
 forward.
 And
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 figure
 out
 why
 and
 how


that's
 happening
 and
 have
 a
 version
 that


counteracts
 that.
 Otherwise,
 this
 will


become
 more
 slowed.
 It
 will
 not
 go


faster.


>> Well,
 you
 bring
 up
 a
 good
 point
 there.


There
 are
 I
 would
 say
 there's
 legitimate


and
 illegitimate
 reasons
 to
 be
 skeptical


of
 AI.
 So,
 the
 one
 that
 you
 bring
 up,


Chimoth,
 that
 I
 think
 is
 very
 legitimate


is
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 stand
 up


a
 lot
 more
 electricity
 power
 generation.


Otherwise,
 it
 could
 drive
 residential


rates
 up
 and
 that
 will
 create
 a
 backlash


to
 AI
 and
 the
 buildout
 of
 data
 centers


and
 we
 don't
 want
 that.
 So,
 that's
 a


legitimate
 issue
 that
 has
 to
 be
 solved.


However,
 there
 are
 what
 I
 would
 call


illegitimate
 reasons
 to
 fear
 AI.
 And


that's
 got
 everything
 to
 do
 with
 the


media
 environment.
 And
 there
 spreading


of
 all
 these
 unproven
 narratives
 in
 many


cases
 based
 on
 contrived
 studies
 where


they're
 saying
 that,
 you
 know,
 there's


going to
 be
 50%
 job
 loss
 in
 the
 next
 few


years
 or
 you
 have
 all
 the
 Terminator


type
 scenarios
 where
 AI
 is
 going to
 grow


beyond
 our
 control.
 all
 of
 these
 doomer


narratives
 that
 are
 being
 created
 that


are
 scaring
 people
 and
 creating
 a


knee-jerk
 reaction
 at
 the
 state
 level,


which
 we
 talked
 about
 last
 week,
 where


there's
 now
 a thousand
 bills
 going


through
 state
 legislatores
 mostly


because
 the
 legislators
 feel
 a
 need
 to


quote
 unquote
 do
 something,
 not
 because


they
 know
 what
 they
 want
 to
 do.
 So,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 unnecessary
 fear
 out


there
 that's
 been
 created
 by
 the
 media


and
 then
 by
 organizations
 and
 companies


who
 have
 a
 regulatory
 capture
 agenda


around
 this.


>> I
 hear
 you.
 What
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 we


need
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 fix
 this


because
 you
 can't
 have
 Google,


Microsoft,
 and
 Amazon
 cancel
 essential


projects
 that
 advance
 this
 entire
 sector


and
 economy
 forward.
 We're
 not
 talking


about
 some
 random
 fly
 by
 night
 business


here.
 We're
 talking
 about
 three
 of
 the


five
 pinnacle
 horsemen
 of
 the
 AI
 race


that
 we
 are
 fielding
 on
 the
 field.


>> Well,
 you
 we're
 looking
 for
 suggestions.


Do
 you
 have
 any
 off
 the
 top
 of
 your


head?
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 in
 education?
 Do


you
 think
 it's
 in
 explaining
 the
 value


of
 AI
 and
 how
 those
 people
 in
 those


states
 would
 benefit
 from
 it
 or
 do
 you


think
 it's
 just
 simple
 economics
 lower


their
 electricity
 bill?


>> I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 things.
 The
 people


in
 Indiana
 and
 Wisconsin
 said
 again


electricity
 prices,
 water
 and
 noise.
 I


think
 that
 we
 can
 fix
 those
 problems
 and


I
 think
 we
 we
 meaning
 our
 industry
 and


specifically
 the
 hyperscalers


need
 to
 start
 using
 these
 gobs
 of
 free


cash
 that
 today
 public
 markets
 don't


value
 anyways.
 It's
 not
 like
 Google,


Amazon,
 Facebook
 gets
 credit
 for
 their


cash.
 In
 fact,
 Facebook's
 stock
 price


went
 up
 when
 they
 basically
 burned


through
 all
 their
 cash.
 You
 want
 to
 see


them
 invest.
 And
 so,
 if
 you
 really
 want


to
 take
 the
 capex
 around
 AI
 and
 make
 it


a
 true
 super
 cycle,
 there's
 another


avenue
 of
 where
 capital
 can
 be
 deployed.


I
 would
 encourage
 the
 CEOs
 of
 these


companies
 to
 wake
 up
 and
 get
 their
 act


together
 and
 do
 it.
 That's
 number
 one.


And
 then
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 I
 think


that
 we
 need
 to
 have
 better
 spokesman


for
 our
 industry.
 So
 meaning
 every
 time


you
 see
 somebody
 talking
 about
 all
 these


naval
 gazing
 technologies
 and
 then
 can't


translate
 it
 into
 simple
 English
 into


product
 value.
 For
 example,
 this
 week
 on


the
 one
 side
 we
 have
 anthropic
 AI


doomerism
 that
 Saxs
 had
 to
 confront,
 but


then
 on
 the
 other
 side
 there
 were
 all
 of


these
 people
 that
 got
 freaked
 out


because
 open
 AI
 wants
 to
 push
 towards


erotica
 and
 all
 they
 could
 think
 of
 was


the
 impact
 to
 their
 children.


Again,
 this
 is
 not
 necessarily
 true
 or


not
 true,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 we
 need
 to


have
 better,
 more
 eloquent,


reasonable
 spokesman
 who
 can
 articulate


a
 vision
 that
 everybody
 can
 buy
 into.


And
 I
 said
 this
 on
 X,
 what
 is
 Arabella


and
 Soros
 going
 to
 get
 behind
 now
 to


find
 a
 boogeyman?
 You
 don't
 have
 Israel.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 have,
 you
 know,


Ukraine
 soon.
 So,
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to


find
 as
 a
 boogeyman?
 And
 it's
 it's


unfortunately
 sitting
 right
 in
 our


backyard.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 sure
 Altman
 is
 the


greatest
 spokesperson
 for
 the
 industry.


Just
 to
 to
 clean
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 here,


uh
 Freeberg,
 my
 position
 isn't


doomerism.
 I
 just
 think
 displacement
 is


going
 to
 be
 more
 significant
 than
 we


think.
 And
 the
 evidence
 I
 have
 of
 that


is
 just
 watching
 what's
 happening
 with


young
 people
 applying
 for
 jobs
 and
 the


increase
 in
 unemployment
 there.
 And
 then


looking
 at
 the
 people
 who
 deploy
 AI
 at


the
 highest
 velocity
 which
 are
 obviously


tech
 companies
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


Alphabet


you
 know
 they
 had
 peak
 Googlers
 in
 2022


190,000
 and
 they've
 had
 massive
 earnings


and
 profits
 increase
 and
 have
 187,000


people
 now
 in
 other
 words
 less.
 And
 then


you
 do
 the
 same
 for
 Meta
 Uber
 and


Amazon.
 You
 know,
 Meta
 peaked
 at
 86,000


employees
 now
 at
 75,
 Uber
 at
 33,
 now
 at


31.
 And
 Amazon,
 where
 you'd
 think
 you'd


have
 a
 lot
 of
 growth
 here,
 uh
 they're
 at


they
 peaked
 at
 1.6
 and
 now
 they're
 down


at
 1.55.
 So,
 these
 companies
 are
 not


hiring.
 the
 gains
 they're
 talking
 about


publicly
 in
 the
 deployment
 of
 AI
 are


significant
 and
 they
 all
 have
 aggressive


plans
 to
 use
 automation
 specifically
 in


robots
 and
 self-driving
 and
 obviously


knowledge
 work
 to
 reduce
 headcount


increase
 profits
 and
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 become
 the
 narrative
 that's


going
 to
 be
 very
 challenging
 for
 our


industry
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 our
 own


companies
 they're
 saying
 wait
 a
 second


your
 companies
 aren't
 growing
 and
 my
 kid


got
 a
 computer
 science
 degree
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 unemployment
 level
 of
 people


graduating
 with
 computer
 science
 degrees


who
 are
 developers.
 It's
 increasing.


Unemployment
 amongst
 developers
 is


increasing
 and
 that's
 just
 really


notable.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 I'm
 a


dumerrist,
 but
 I
 am
 concerned
 that
 the


new
 jobs
 might
 not
 show
 up
 as
 quickly
 as


the
 old
 jobs
 or
 the
 static
 team
 size
 uh


trend
 continues
 because
 we've
 had
 static


team
 sizes
 for
 years
 now.
