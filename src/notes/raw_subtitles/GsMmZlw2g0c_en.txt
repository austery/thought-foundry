Chris, welcome.
The company divesting non-core assets
for, for example, earlier this year
announcing the sale of its mass market
residential fiber unit to AT&T for $5.75
billion in cash.
Now, what you're planning to do is
leasing existing fiber routes to
hyperscalers and social media companies
to transport air traffic between data
centers.
I want to know how big of an opportunity
is it to lease to these hyperscalers?
Yeah.
Thanks for having me today.
It's it's been quite a journey at
looming over the last three and a half
years.
And really what we see is an opportunity
and have seen really through our
transformation is the AI multi-cloud
world that's being developed right now.
The network of yesterday wasn't built to
support it.
And if you really think about the
economics of AI and the economics of a
GPU, you want to keep that GPU fed
as much as it can consume so that
they're spinning constantly.
And that's where you get the economic
benefit.
So the problem with the network that has
existed so far is that as those data
loads get spread further and further
away,
as data centres are in search of power
in cooler temperatures, there's latency
problems and there's access problems.
It takes a long time for networking to
adjust.
So what we're doing is building a mesh
that basically goes anywhere to anywhere
where the customer on demand can move
those workloads where they need them in
super low latency manner.
So that's the big change.
And so it's not just hyperscalers, it's
really the full connectivity between the
hyperscalers running those clouds, the
hyperscalers obviously building those AI
algorithms and large enterprise
customers who are on the journey now and
and will be using it much more heavily
in the future.
Chris, thanks for joining us again.
It's great to to chat.
Just wondering with the AT&T deal and
also what you've done in capital markets
in recent weeks, you've really improved
your financing structure.
You've you're saving hundreds of
millions in interest expenses a year.
Talk to us a little bit about that.
Yeah.
If you go back in time when we all
joined Lumen and saw this opportunity,
the balance sheet was not our friend.
We had a lot of debt.
Half that debt was due in one year.
It was due in 2027.
And that was job number one.
We really needed to strengthen the
foundation of the company so that we
could go do the things that we're
executing against today.
So that was really accomplished through
a couple of things.
One is we did the largest out-of-court
debt restructuring in history.
That's not quite two years ago, and that
allowed us to push those maturities out
a bit.
But at a at a significant expense are
annualized interest expense at that
point was about $1.4 billion.
But from there, we saw in the middle of
those negotiations, we saw this
opportunity with the hyperscalers and
soon after that, that debt negotiation
was completed.
We we signed $8 billion worth of deals,
and that has grown since.
That allowed us to monetize an asset
that has been in the ground for 25
years, which is conduit that we can we
can blow fiber through to meet the needs
of the hyperscalers in a fairly short
period of time versus building new.
And that's really the the core enduring
advantage of this business.
And then we layer the digital on top of
that.
But but the cash from those deals
allowed us to refinance and delever.
So we've made a number of moves so far
this year.
And with the sale of the consumer fiber
business to AT&T, when that closes, our
debt will be down to just over $13
billion.
In our interest expense on an annualized
basis will be about 700 million.
So in a two year period, dramatically
reshaping both the quantum of debt as
well as the maturity curve.
And now that balance sheet is a real
asset for us as we invest in the A.I.
multi-cloud world.
Now, I'm actually wondering about the
investments.
Of course, there's a lot of CapEx that's
required in a business like like yours.
We've seen earlier this year, the the
one big beautiful bill act that was
passed which tries to encourage
investment and including in capital
investments by allowing you as CFO to
depreciate certain investments faster.
Like do you think this will make an
impact as you're thinking about future
investments in your business here in the
U.S.?
Definitely.
If you go back to the 2017 legislation
that the big problem with that
legislation is it created an equal
playing field between, say, more service
oriented or asset light companies and
asset heavy or infrastructure companies.
And if if you look at where the
administration is focused today, it's
clearly around infrastructure.
That's where I think the US has the
biggest challenges really is it is
making sure that we don't get too far
behind with our infrastructure.
So the recent legislation has leveled
that playing field and really that was
around two things.
The first is, is that there was interest
deductibility, limits that that used to
exist, that have been relaxed
dramatically because, again, asset heavy
infrastructure companies tend to have
higher leverage.
And then to your point, the ability to
accelerate depreciation
to help on the tax side is significant.
That reduces the risk that
companies that are investing in
infrastructure take on when they make
those kinds of investments.
So it's absolutely an opportunity for
us.
Chris, you have to leave it there, but
