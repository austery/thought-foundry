Hi
 everyone
 and
 welcome
 to
 In
 Good


Company.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund.
 And


today
 we
 have
 a
 very
 special
 guest,


Christelle
 Edaman,
 the
 chief
 executive


of
 Orange
 Group.
 Now
 Orange
 is
 one
 of


the
 largest
 telco
 companies
 in
 Europe


and
 in
 the
 world
 actually
 with
 2190


million
 customers.
 And
 Crystal
 is
 an
 uh


engineer
 by
 training,
 transformative


leader,
 and
 an
 avid
 mountain
 tracker.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 learn
 about
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 Castell,
 big
 welcome.


>> Thank
 you.
 It's
 a
 pleasure
 to
 be
 here.


>> Why
 is
 the
 telecom
 sector
 interesting?


>> Actually,
 what's
 interesting
 is
 that
 we


are
 in
 everybody's
 life
 in
 actually
 in


good
 moments
 and
 and
 we
 don't
 realize


it,
 but
 we
 rely
 on
 connectivity
 all
 the


day.
 I
 mean,
 as
 companies,
 are
 humans,


we're
 always
 connected.
 We
 look
 at
 our


phones
 and
 so
 the
 technology
 is


surrounding
 us
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 do.


So,
 we
 are
 here
 in
 the
 life
 of
 the


citizens,
 the
 people,
 our
 families.
 And


then
 of
 course
 where
 it's
 actually
 more


impacting
 is
 of
 course
 we
 are
 here
 in


times
 in
 good
 times
 the
 Olympics
 in


Paris
 for
 for
 instance
 with
 a
 great


experience
 where
 everyone
 was
 connected


and
 everyone
 could
 see
 but
 it's
 also
 the


case
 when
 things
 go
 wrong
 and
 that's
 ex


I
 mean
 you've
 seen
 a
 number
 of
 blackouts


in
 countries
 or
 when
 there's
 extreme


events
 and
 that's
 when
 actually


connectivity
 is
 more
 important
 than
 ever


because
 you
 want
 to
 reach
 out
 to
 your


family.
 You
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 connect.


So
 I
 think
 the
 the
 that's
 why
 the


telecom
 sector
 is
 so
 fascinating
 because


we
 are
 here
 people
 don't
 realize
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 technology
 behind
 it's


simple
 you
 turn
 on
 your
 mobile
 phone
 and


you
 see
 the
 connectivity
 actually
 you're


not
 happy
 when
 it's
 not
 connected


actually


>> absolutely
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


what
 are
 the
 most
 important
 trends
 in


this
 sector
 just
 now


>> well
 I
 think
 this
 industry
 went
 I
 mean


has
 gone
 through
 many
 cycles
 of
 I
 mean


transformation
 and
 so
 of
 course
 there's


been
 first
 the
 the
 big
 mobile
 adoption
 I


and
 then
 the
 web
 and
 the
 mobile
 phones


and
 the
 smartphones
 and
 the
 big
 data
 and


the
 streaming
 of
 video
 on
 our
 networks


which
 has
 really
 changed
 the
 profile
 of


the
 traffic
 on
 our
 networks.
 Of
 course,


the
 big
 trend
 these
 days
 is
 the
 fast


adoption
 of
 AI.
 And
 the
 big
 question
 is


what
 impact
 will
 that
 have
 on
 our


networks
 and
 what
 type
 of
 traffic
 what


will
 change?
 Will
 we
 need
 uh
 low
 latency


type
 of
 use
 cases
 when
 everyone
 has


glasses?
 So,
 so
 we're
 thinking
 about
 the


the
 we're
 very
 humble
 because
 the
 the


the
 size
 of
 the


>> latency
 is
 the
 speed
 it
 takes
 for


>> latency
 because
 you
 think
 of
 I
 mean


video
 streaming
 was
 really
 I
 mean


downloading
 video
 and
 there's
 been
 a
 lot


of
 things
 on
 our
 network
 which
 actually


people
 don't
 see
 but
 I
 mean
 content


delivery
 networks
 and
 all
 that
 with
 AI


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 use
 cases


where
 some
 use
 cases
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 about


security
 some
 will
 be
 AI
 at
 the
 edge
 on


your
 mobile
 phone
 when
 you
 need
 realtime


translation
 for
 instance


Some
 of
 it
 will
 I
 mean
 requires
 actually


a
 lot
 of
 compute
 power
 in
 the
 cloud


because
 you
 can't
 distribute
 it.
 So
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 potential
 scenarios
 and


we're
 looking
 at
 it.
 We've
 actually


created
 at
 the
 GSMA
 an
 observatory
 of
 AI


traffic
 because
 what
 is
 for
 sure
 is
 that


today
 AI
 keeps
 on
 increasing
 the
 the


volume
 of
 traffic.
 You
 see
 it
 with


social
 networks
 and
 and
 I
 think
 what's


probably
 the
 biggest
 trend
 is
 that
 we


are
 trusted
 partner
 for
 our
 customers.


It's
 today
 the
 the
 art
 of
 the
 possible


because
 of
 AI,
 the
 increase
 of
 fraud,


the
 fake
 news,
 all
 this
 debate
 around
 am


I
 talking
 to
 someone
 who's
 a
 real
 person


when
 I
 get
 a
 phone
 call
 and
 and
 so


there's
 also


>> you
 are
 you
 are
 talking
 to
 a
 real
 person


here
 today.


>> I
 am
 talking
 to
 a
 real
 person
 of
 course.


>> What
 are
 the
 main
 challenge?
 What
 are


the
 main
 challenges?


>> Well,
 the
 main
 challenges
 in
 the
 telecom


industry
 is
 of
 course
 that
 the
 value
 in


telecom
 industry
 has
 been
 huge
 value


creation
 when
 mobile
 adoption
 was
 spread


out.
 Now
 demography
 in
 western
 world
 is


uh
 flat
 if
 not
 declining
 and
 so
 there's


there's
 a
 big
 question
 about
 value


creation
 because
 we
 keep
 it's
 a
 capital


intensive
 uh
 industry
 and
 so
 how
 do
 we


continue
 to
 invest
 in
 our
 networks
 while


creating
 value
 in
 mature
 markets.
 So
 the


big
 question
 of
 course
 especially
 in


Europe
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


consolidation
 because
 especially
 in


Europe
 the
 industry
 is
 very
 fragmented


and
 it's
 a
 business
 of
 scale
 and


>> and
 you
 you've
 been
 vocal
 about
 the
 uh


the
 need
 for
 consolidation
 so
 the


situation
 now
 uh
 each
 country
 three


players
 so
 or
 roughly
 27
 countries
 three


players
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 players
 in


America
 three
 players
 in
 a
 much
 bigger


country
 correct
 and
 what
 are
 the


implications
 of
 of
 this


>> so
 the
 implications
 is
 that
 it's
 a


business
 of
 scale
 so
 if
 you
 have
 150
 50


million
 customers
 on
 a
 mobile
 network.


It's
 not
 the
 same
 or
 even
 500
 million
 as


or
 even
 1
 billion
 as
 China
 Mobile
 has
 in


China.
 It's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 if
 you
 have


20
 million
 customer
 as
 we
 have
 as
 a


large
 operator
 in
 most
 of
 our
 countries


and
 even
 lower
 in
 most
 countries
 who


have
 less
 than
 5
 million.
 So,
 so
 the


cost
 of
 running
 the
 network
 per
 customer


is
 actually
 more
 expensive
 in
 Europe


than
 it
 is
 in
 other
 countries.
 So
 that's


why
 we
 have
 to
 consolidate
 and
 and


>> give
 us
 give
 us
 a
 feel
 for
 the
 the
 the


difference.
 So
 okay
 I'm
 a
 China
 mobile
 1


billion


>> correct


>> I'm
 some
 kind
 of
 da
 operator
 in
 Europe


let's
 say
 I've
 got
 10
 million
 what's
 the


difference
 in
 terms
 of
 cost
 of
 operation


here?
 So
 the
 difference
 is
 ability
 to


invest
 in
 your
 network
 because
 for
 the


same
 number
 of
 customer
 you
 put
 on
 your


network.
 So
 of
 course
 the
 the
 size
 the


geography
 impacts
 but
 in
 a
 given
 city


the
 cost
 I
 mean
 it's
 procurement
 because


you
 buy
 millions
 of
 I
 mean
 mobile
 sites


when
 you're
 China
 mobile
 we
 buy


thousands
 of
 mobile
 sites.
 So
 there's


just
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 order
 of


magnitude
 and
 then
 and
 then
 of
 course
 so


that's
 the
 the
 speed
 the
 roll
 out
 of
 5G


for
 instance
 is
 moving
 much
 faster
 in


the
 US
 or
 in
 China
 than
 it
 is
 in
 Europe.


the
 ability
 to
 reach
 the
 I
 would
 say
 to


develop
 I
 mean
 fiber
 in
 Europe
 we
 have


the
 same
 debates
 and
 that's
 because
 the


markets
 are
 fragmented
 actually
 we're


not
 benefiting
 from
 these
 450
 million


market
 size
 that
 Europe
 is
 and
 that's


not
 because
 that's
 because
 we
 just
 have


27
 member
 states
 with
 27
 different


markets


>> and
 as
 a
 as
 a
 customer
 how
 do
 I
 see
 it


>> well
 as
 a
 customer
 you
 see
 it
 because
 I


mean


>> but
 do
 I
 have
 do
 I
 pay
 more
 than


>> so
 as
 a
 customer
 actually
 you
 pay
 you


don't
 pay
 more.
 The
 the
 consumers
 in


Europe
 see
 the
 benefit
 if
 you
 live
 in
 a


big
 city
 today
 in
 Europe
 and
 and
 we
 have


price
 points
 especially
 in
 this
 country


where
 today
 in
 France
 I
 mean
 France
 has


the
 cheapest
 mobile
 data
 packages


actually
 in
 Europe
 and
 and
 probably
 even


cheaper
 much
 cheaper
 than
 than
 in
 US.
 So


that's
 very
 good
 for
 consumers.
 The


challenge
 is
 long-term
 the
 ability
 to


invest
 in
 network
 and
 and
 of
 course


resilience
 of
 network
 is
 a
 big
 is
 a
 big


question
 because
 of
 extreme
 events.
 I


was
 mentioning
 it
 the
 ability
 to


continue
 to
 invest
 in
 so
 so
 consumer
 on


on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis
 you
 may
 not
 notice


it
 but
 for
 political
 leaders
 and
 we've


seen
 that
 you
 see
 telecom
 operators


selling
 their
 networks
 their
 fixed


network
 or
 their
 mobile
 networks
 and


then
 it's
 a
 kind
 of
 sell
 and
 lease
 back


model
 because
 of
 the
 pressure
 on
 their


cash
 flow
 and
 the
 level
 of
 depth.
 So


that's
 actually
 for
 from
 a
 consumer


standpoint
 dayto-day
 you
 don't
 see
 it


unless
 you
 travel


>> which
 which
 is
 also
 the
 why
 they
 have


regulated
 in
 this
 way
 right.
 So
 the


European
 uh
 competition
 regulator
 has


thought
 that
 you
 know
 we
 need
 big


competition
 in
 every
 country
 right
 you


need
 three
 players
 and
 so
 therefore
 you


get
 the
 prices
 down
 but
 you
 have
 no


European
 champion


>> ex
 exactly
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 mean


>> but
 you
 think
 this
 will
 happen


>> the
 Mario
 Draggy
 report
 was
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 very
 difficult
 to
 combine
 to


one
 single
 telecom
 market
 in
 Europe
 for


various
 reasons
 in
 this
 environment
 you


take
 I
 mean
 security
 I
 mean
 depth
 I
 mean


depth
 country
 depth
 where
 I
 mean
 and


spectrum
 for
 instance
 is
 a
 big
 topic
 But


this
 is
 something
 that
 the
 member
 states


will
 will
 hardly
 I
 mean
 transfer
 to
 the


European
 Union.
 That
 being
 said,
 I
 think


as
 a
 telecom
 operator,
 our
 job
 is
 to
 be


this
 platform
 because
 we
 operate
 in
 many


countries
 in
 Europe
 and
 we
 can
 have
 this


platform
 that
 helps
 I
 would
 say
 unify


the
 customer
 experience
 and
 we
 benefit


from
 the
 scale
 actually
 of
 being
 across


multiple
 countries
 but
 it's
 it
 takes


time
 and
 for
 the
 time
 being
 we
 are
 so


focused
 on
 competing
 in
 every
 single


market
 with
 with
 frankly
 deflationary


prices
 many
 other
 sectors
 including


utility
 sector
 you
 take
 energy


water,
 food,
 everything.
 The
 prices
 have


increased
 in
 the
 past
 years.
 That's
 not


the
 case
 in
 telecom.


>> So
 you
 are,
 you
 mentioned
 platform.
 You


are
 in
 a
 way
 providing
 a
 platform.
 You


are
 putting
 in
 billions
 and
 billions
 in


uh
 in
 investments
 and
 then
 hey,
 social


media
 companies
 come
 makes
 lots
 of


money,
 much
 more
 than
 you.


>> Correct.


>> So
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 fair?


>> Well,
 I
 mean


>> it's
 a
 kind
 of a
 leading
 question.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 business
 is
 not
 always


fair.
 So
 it's


>> how
 did
 you
 end
 up
 in
 this
 situation


that
 you
 are
 spending
 so
 much
 money
 and


making
 so
 little
 money
 compared
 to
 the


these
 other
 guys?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 because
 I


mean
 that's
 the
 concept
 of
 I
 mean
 in


innovating
 on
 top
 of
 networks
 and
 and
 we


are
 trying
 to
 create
 this
 platform
 that


would
 pre
 I
 mean
 allow
 us
 to
 gain
 scale


but
 part
 of
 it
 is
 because
 we're
 highly


regulated
 and
 this
 regulation
 is
 not


just
 about
 the
 price
 and
 the
 antitrust.


I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 regulation.
 Even


the
 price
 of
 the
 infrastructure
 we
 sell


is
 regulated
 and
 there's
 a
 whack.
 I
 mean


for
 I
 mean
 the
 whack
 is
 in
 the


regulation.
 It's
 not
 the
 whack
 that
 I


that
 our
 investors
 expect
 and
 and
 that


we
 as
 a
 company
 have.
 It's
 something


that's
 there's
 a
 parallel
 world
 of


regulation


>> the
 cost
 of
 capital
 right


>> cost
 of
 capital
 that
 in
 the
 in
 the


regulation
 for
 infrastructure.
 So,
 so
 I


think
 the
 way
 the
 regulation
 today
 is
 in


our
 sector
 is
 really
 based
 on
 this
 will


to
 open
 the
 telecom
 market
 to
 a
 lot
 more


competition
 and
 and
 we
 need
 to
 update


that.
 Now
 the
 the
 OTT
 player
 as
 we
 call


them
 whether
 it's
 a
 plat
 video
 platform,


social
 networks
 I
 mean
 the
 issue
 is
 that


somehow
 they
 monetize
 data
 of
 customers


because
 there's
 no
 free
 lunch
 if
 you


have
 free
 of
 charge
 service
 there
 must


have
 a
 monetization
 model.
 The
 issue


that
 we
 see
 today
 is
 that
 of
 course


their
 monetization
 model
 relies
 on
 more


traffic
 on
 our
 network
 because
 the
 more


traffic
 they
 generate
 the
 more
 data
 they


get
 the
 more
 I
 mean
 publicity
 they
 can


make
 of
 course
 for
 us
 more
 traffic
 on


our
 networks
 means
 more
 investment
 so
 so


I
 think
 that's
 where
 we
 have
 a
 challenge


and
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 fix
 it
 and
 to


discuss
 with
 them
 because
 whether
 you


have


>> are
 you
 going
 to
 make
 uh
 good
 returns
 on


your
 next
 big
 investments


>> well
 we're
 trying
 to
 reduce
 investments


as
 a
 consequence
 And
 that's
 what
 the


telecom
 industry
 is
 going
 through.
 So
 we


are
 trying
 to
 reduce
 investment
 and
 to


limit.
 Of
 course,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 to


decrease
 the
 quality
 of
 experience
 for


our
 customers.
 That's
 a
 challenge.
 Who


should
 bear
 the
 cost
 of
 an
 increased


quality
 of
 video
 on
 your
 mobile
 phone


when
 it's
 to
 serve
 only
 some
 of
 the


social
 on
 or
 video
 platforms
 and
 uh
 when


actually
 we're
 just
 doing
 our
 job
 which


is
 to
 provide
 the
 same
 quality
 to


everyone.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 debate
 and


and
 we're
 trying
 to
 innovate
 in
 that


front.
 But
 so
 we
 we
 are
 now
 at
 5G.
 What


is
 6G
 going
 to
 look
 like?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


6G.
 Actually,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


5.5,
 5.6.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 move.


>> Okay.
 What
 is
 5.5?


>> Actually,
 now
 6G
 upgrade.
 That's
 not
 We


got
 used
 to
 2G,
 3G,
 4G,
 5G.
 We
 got
 used


to
 it
 and
 and
 I
 think
 now
 we're
 in
 the


world
 of
 software.
 Software
 is
 not
 about


big
 bang
 hardware
 renewal,
 etc.
 So,
 it's


going to
 be
 progressive
 upgrade
 of
 our


existing
 5G
 network
 that
 will
 be


software.
 So
 that's
 why
 it's
 going to
 be


a
 release
 software
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 I


don't
 think
 I
 mean
 of
 course
 some
 people


are
 working
 on
 6G
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 anytime
 soon.


>> So
 security
 what
 how
 is
 it
 security


going
 to
 change?


>> Well
 security
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 talking


about
 AI.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 I
 mean
 questions
 around
 AI
 adoption


and
 ethics
 around
 AI
 and
 and
 and
 private


data
 and
 and
 for
 company
 as
 well
 not


just
 for
 consumers
 and
 and
 I
 think
 the


question
 about
 increase
 of
 fraud
 and
 and


fake
 news
 and
 and
 and
 attacks
 cyber


attacks
 of
 course
 we're
 investing
 a
 lot


on
 cyber
 security
 to
 protect
 our


networks
 to
 protect
 our
 customers
 and
 we


see
 I
 mean
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 the
 the


the
 the
 threats
 are
 increasing
 is
 just


accelerated
 as
 fast
 as
 AI
 is


accelerating
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 I


mean
 a
 request
 more
 and
 more
 we
 see
 that


from
 from
 our
 customers
 and
 and
 that's


true
 for
 for
 consumers
 because
 people


are
 not
 picking
 up
 the
 phone
 anymore


because
 they
 are
 not
 sure
 whether
 it's


fraud
 or
 whether
 it's
 actually
 a
 real


number.
 How
 often
 do
 you
 look
 at
 your


telephone?


>> Way
 too
 often
 actually.
 Even
 though
 I


tell
 I
 tell
 my
 kids
 not
 to
 uh
 I
 can
 I


mean
 in
 meetings
 it's
 uh
 I
 don't
 know


some
 depend
 if
 I
 get
 bored
 in
 a
 meeting


then
 I
 know
 if
 I'm
 looking
 too
 much
 my


phone
 I
 know
 I
 should
 move
 to
 something


else.


>> Do
 you
 have
 do
 you
 have
 digital
 detox


periods?


>> Actually
 given
 I
 have
 kids
 that
 are


still
 young.
 They
 are
 my
 detox
 because


when
 I
 go
 back
 home
 in
 the
 evening
 they


want
 me
 to
 read
 them
 a
 story
 and
 they


don't
 care
 whether
 I've
 had
 a
 good
 day


or
 a
 bad
 day.
 I
 still
 have
 to
 work.
 So


that's
 my
 detox.


>> That's
 good.
 Um
 just
 coming
 back
 to
 the


uh
 the
 security
 and
 so
 on.
 Um
 how
 should


we
 think
 about
 supply
 chains?
 So
 for


instance,
 um
 Chinese
 uh
 providers
 of


infrastructure.
 Well,
 I
 think
 supply


chain
 are
 really
 interconnected
 these


days
 and
 and
 and
 we've
 seen
 that
 during


COVID
 and
 and
 we
 see
 that
 today
 the


technology
 and
 of
 course
 we
 follow
 the


rules
 when
 in
 some
 countries
 where
 I


mean
 we
 are
 we
 are
 instructed
 not
 to
 use


some
 vendors
 and
 that's
 especially
 true


for
 5G
 for
 instance
 uh
 Chinese
 vendors


for
 5G
 in
 in
 Europe.
 That
 being
 said,


when
 we
 see
 the
 speed
 of
 innovation
 in


China,
 uh
 we
 we
 work
 as
 well
 with


Chinese
 vendors
 of
 course
 more
 in
 Africa


than
 than
 than
 in
 Europe.
 U
 what's


difficult
 is
 that
 of
 course
 I
 mean


Chinese
 vendors
 or
 European
 vendors
 when


it
 when
 there's
 scarcity
 and
 we've
 seen


that
 with
 all
 the
 supply
 chain


disruption.
 I
 mean
 whether
 it's
 a


chipset,
 whether
 it's
 energy
 actually


which
 is
 a
 big
 big
 important
 item
 for


for
 the
 continuity
 of
 our
 activity.
 uh


of
 course
 uh
 all
 the
 equipment
 the
 the


devices
 of
 we
 don't
 like
 to
 have
 one


source
 one
 vendor
 so
 we
 tend
 to
 have


this
 policy
 where
 we
 of
 course
 want
 to


rely
 and
 and
 diversify
 our
 sources
 but


in
 some
 areas
 it's
 very
 difficult
 and


and
 mobile
 network
 is
 an
 example
 where


there's
 I
 mean
 China
 vendor
 or
 two


European
 vendors
 but


>> if
 you
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at
 the


technology
 how
 does
 the
 Chinese
 uh


technology
 compare
 with
 European
 and


American


>> well
 I
 mean


>> is
 it
 better
 or
 worse
 or
 I've
 worked
 15


years
 at
 Alcatel
 Lucen.
 So
 I've
 seen
 the


Chinese
 vendors
 growing.
 It's
 actually


cheaper.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 more
 advanced


more
 more
 efficient
 from
 an
 energy


standpoint.
 So
 it's
 actually
 very
 good


technology.
 I
 don't
 think
 European


vendors
 are
 far
 behind
 but
 they
 actually


not
 benefiting
 from
 the
 size
 and
 the


investment
 that
 Chinese
 operators
 make


in
 China.
 And
 so
 Chinese
 technology
 when


it
 comes
 to
 mobile
 network
 are
 very


good.


>> How
 safe
 is
 my
 communication?
 depends


what's
 your
 routine.
 Make
 sure
 you


upload
 make
 sure
 you
 update
 your
 OS
 on


your
 phone
 whenever
 there's
 one
 new


because
 most
 of
 the
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 training
 we
 have
 to
 do
 and
 that's


true
 for
 lead
 company
 leaders
 that's


true
 for
 individuals
 but
 there's
 a


reason
 why
 you
 get
 a
 node
 for
 whether


you
 are
 on
 on
 the
 Apple
 environment
 or


Android
 environment
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


investment
 from
 tech
 companies
 on
 on


security
 I
 mean
 on
 protecting
 consumers


and
 so
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 update
 it


whenever
 there's
 a
 new
 OS
 coming
 on
 your


phone
 because
 most
 of
 the
 time
 is
 to
 to


fix
 a
 security
 issue.


>> What
 do
 you
 put
 in
 the
 expression


digital
 sovereignity?


>> Well,
 digital
 sovereignty
 is
 is
 complex


because
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 it
 should


not
 be
 understood
 as
 let's
 close
 the


border.
 And
 if
 we
 think
 about
 Europe,


digital
 sovereignty
 for
 Europe,
 Europe


relies
 a
 lot
 on
 technology
 that
 comes,


we
 were
 discussing
 China,
 but
 of
 course


US
 technology,
 chipsets
 coming
 from
 Asia


as
 well,
 devices,
 I
 mean
 mobile
 devices


coming
 from
 Asia
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 think


digital
 sovereignty
 the
 the
 way
 we
 call


it
 is
 restrategic
 autonomy
 we've
 defined


it
 at
 orange
 on
 four
 C
 one
 being
 the


control
 be
 understand
 your
 supply
 chain


understand
 try
 to
 avoid
 having
 I
 mean


single
 vendor
 type
 of
 environment
 choice


I
 think
 choice
 is
 both
 having
 many


options
 but
 it's
 also
 reversibility
 and


there's
 a
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 question


behind
 I
 mean
 can
 you
 move
 backward
 in


case
 you
 want
 to
 change
 not
 easy
 with


many
 technology
 if
 we
 think
 about
 cloud


than
 all
 the
 AI
 or
 AI
 tools.
 So,
 uh,


choice,
 control,
 competence
 because
 I


think
 many
 very
 often
 and
 that's
 true
 in


Europe,
 but
 that's
 also
 true
 when
 I
 talk


to
 to
 country
 heads
 in
 Africa
 for


instance,
 having
 the
 competence
 and
 the


skills
 and
 the
 knowhow
 to
 be
 able
 to


understand
 just
 to
 understand
 what's


your
 where
 what
 are
 your
 weaknesses
 and


how
 should
 you
 use
 the
 technology
 that's


also
 part
 of
 strategic
 autonomy,
 the


skill
 set.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 uh
 the
 the


the
 fourth
 one
 is
 uh
 is
 really
 the


scale.
 So
 it's
 um
 uh
 making
 sure
 that


you
 get
 uh
 you
 you
 benefit
 from
 the


scale
 and
 that's
 where
 Europe
 is
 is


somehow
 uh
 at
 at
 at
 a
 difficult


situation
 because
 of
 the
 fragmented


environment
 in
 Europe.


>> Do
 you
 have
 uh
 a
 responsibility
 to
 uh


try
 to
 close
 the
 digital
 divide
 i.e.


that
 uh
 poor
 people
 have
 less
 access
 to


um
 to
 to
 your
 services
 than
 um
 than
 more


wealthy
 people
 like
 across
 across
 the


world.
 Is
 that
 is
 that
 part
 of
 your


responsibility
 you
 think
 or
 or
 are
 you


only
 about
 making
 profits?


>> No,
 that's
 very
 important
 for
 us
 and
 we


operate
 in
 countries
 in
 Africa
 where


actually
 when
 when
 we
 bring
 connectivity


to
 some
 people,
 we
 bring
 energy


together.
 So
 we
 we
 we
 enable
 people
 to


grow
 and
 to
 study
 and
 then
 to
 have
 a
 job


and
 then
 to
 connect
 to
 the
 world
 and
 so


so
 that's
 really
 deep
 in
 our
 conviction


and
 that's
 why
 we
 are
 we
 are
 really
 I


mean
 in
 in
 Africa
 especially
 that's
 true


in
 in
 Europe
 as
 well
 but
 to
 some
 extent


the
 level
 of
 connectivity
 in
 Europe
 is


much
 ahead
 of
 course
 what
 we
 see
 in


other
 parts
 of
 the
 world.
 So
 that's


that's
 always
 been
 very
 deep
 in
 our
 in


our
 values
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 we
 we


reduce
 the
 gap.
 Crystal,
 let's
 move
 on


to
 artificial
 intelligence.
 What
 part
 of


AI
 are
 you
 the
 most
 excited
 about?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 what's
 the
 most
 exciting


with
 AI
 is
 the
 speed
 of
 innovation.
 And


what
 is
 really
 exciting
 is
 that
 AI
 will


enable
 also
 to
 accelerate
 innovation
 in


in
 other
 sciences.
 and
 and
 so
 connecting


I
 mean
 some
 science
 verticals
 to
 I
 mean


you
 think
 of
 healthcare
 drug
 discovery


you
 think
 I
 mean
 science
 in
 in
 physics


uh
 being
 able
 to
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 have
 twins


for
 cells
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 exponential
 and


the
 more
 we
 think
 of
 it
 the
 more
 we
 have


ideas
 of
 things
 that
 could
 accelerate
 so


to
 some
 extent
 it
 can
 be
 also
 a
 bit


scary
 because
 we
 feel
 that
 we
 we
 may


lose
 control
 but
 really
 it's
 exciting


ing
 to
 to
 to
 see
 how
 AI
 may
 may
 allow
 us


to
 address
 issues
 that
 really
 we
 thought


were
 not
 possible.
 I
 mean
 to
 have
 I
 mean


new
 new
 drugs
 I
 mean
 to
 be
 a
 to
 address


we
 think
 of
 course
 of
 resources
 being


able
 to
 create
 new
 materials
 thanks
 to


to
 physics.
 So so
 that's
 of
 course


outside
 the
 I
 mean
 the
 telecom
 industry


but
 that's
 really
 if
 we
 think
 about
 the


possible
 that's
 just
 fascinating.


>> When
 did
 you
 get
 this
 wakeup
 moment?


Well,
 I
 think
 I
 keep
 having
 it.
 Every


time
 I
 talk
 to
 companies
 who
 innovate


with
 AI,
 I'm
 still
 as
 amazed
 as
 I
 was


two
 years
 ago.
 First
 time
 I
 saw
 how
 fast


I
 mean
 OpenAI
 tragy
 was
 adopted
 and


every
 time
 I
 see
 a
 new
 field
 and
 I'm


still
 amazed
 at
 how
 it
 seem
 it's
 it
 even


seems
 that
 it
 keeps
 accelerating.


>> Do
 you
 think
 people
 generally
 have


realized


what's
 going
 on?
 I
 think
 on
 one
 side


there's
 been
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of


debates
 and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 debates


especially
 in
 Europe
 we've
 been
 debating


regulation.
 We
 had
 the
 AI
 summit
 in


Paris
 hosted
 by
 by
 France
 and
 India
 and


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 debate.
 So
 so
 people


talk
 about
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 you
 talk
 to


young
 people
 they
 use
 AI
 all
 the
 time.


So
 so
 they're
 already
 into
 it
 but
 they


don't
 use
 it
 with
 the
 I
 mean
 it's
 just


to
 to
 to
 manage
 knowledge
 somehow.
 I


think
 the
 more
 we
 think
 of
 it,
 I
 don't


think
 most
 people
 realize
 on
 one
 side,


especially
 in
 Europe,
 I
 mean,
 we
 need
 to


be
 humble.
 We
 need
 to
 learn.
 We
 need
 to


adopt
 AI
 because
 I
 think
 what
 would
 be,


I
 mean,
 an
 issue
 for
 Europe
 would
 be
 to


stay
 behind
 and
 to
 wait
 and
 see
 until


it's
 actually
 too
 late
 because
 time
 is


really
 accelerating.
 So
 and
 and
 speed
 is


not
 something
 where
 we
 tend
 to
 be
 good


at
 in
 Europe
 because
 of
 I
 mean
 the


political
 environment
 the
 regulation


etc.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 our
 role
 as


company
 leaders
 to
 work
 with
 of
 course


our
 suppliers
 as
 well
 to
 make
 sure
 that


we
 really
 adopt
 AI
 as
 fast
 as
 possible.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 question
 on
 ethics
 and


which
 we
 have
 to
 address
 but


>> how
 is
 it
 changing
 u
 orange
 the
 way
 you


work?
 Well,
 the
 way
 we
 work,
 we've


developed,
 I
 mean,
 we've
 provided
 tools


to
 employees.
 We
 have
 70,000
 employees


who
 use
 it
 every
 day.
 So,
 that's
 more


daytoday
 management,
 testing
 it.
 And


then,
 of
 course,
 we're
 developing
 I


mean,
 now
 there's
 this
 agent
 AI,
 agentic


AI,
 which
 job
 we're
 trying
 to
 I
 mean,


we're
 testing
 it.
 I
 think
 what's
 very


interesting
 is
 that
 AI
 will
 be
 a


technology
 very
 decentralized.
 So
 you


need
 to
 define
 of
 course
 some
 very


strong
 fundamentals
 platforms
 and


protecting
 the
 company
 but
 then
 you
 need


to
 put
 the
 technology
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 of


managers
 because
 that's
 where
 the


transformation
 happens
 and
 and
 it's
 not


something
 that
 we
 can
 decide
 in
 a
 in
 a


in
 a
 headquarter
 or
 in
 a
 in
 a
 meeting


room
 and
 then
 decide
 that
 we're
 going
 to


we're
 going
 to
 spread.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 thing
 very
 interesting


with
 AI
 and
 and
 we
 see
 it
 whether
 it's


in
 finance,
 in
 HR,
 in
 sales,
 in
 customer


support
 of
 course
 big
 big
 time
 for


customer
 support.
 Uh
 now
 it
 takes
 time


as
 well
 to
 roll
 out
 at
 scale
 because


it's
 I
 mean
 it
 addresses
 things
 that
 we


all
 know
 I
 mean
 quality
 of
 data
 and
 then


making
 sure
 you
 cut
 the
 silos
 that
 you


may
 have
 in
 your
 technical
 depth
 etc.
 So


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 we
 were


working
 on
 already
 before
 that
 just
 keep


on
 being
 visible
 with
 with
 AI
 adoption.


M
 I
 believe
 that
 earlier
 this
 year
 you


demonstrated
 the
 world's
 first
 uh


real-time
 conversation
 using
 generative


AI
 um
 enhanced
 by
 5G.
 So
 what
 is
 that?


>> Well,
 we
 have
 this
 demo
 at
 Mobile
 World


Congress
 where
 actually
 if
 you
 want
 to


have
 real
 time
 translation
 and
 what's


interesting
 with
 AI
 is
 that
 voice
 will


be
 a
 I
 mean
 in
 many
 actually
 will
 be
 a


new
 interface.
 It's
 going
 to
 some
 of
 it


will
 be
 back
 to
 voice
 in
 the
 way
 we


interact
 with
 our
 mobile
 phone
 because


if
 you
 don't
 I
 mean
 it's
 going
 to


simplify
 the
 interface
 with
 machine
 and


so
 voice
 will
 be
 a
 new
 human
 machine


interface
 uh
 not
 new
 on
 the
 mobile
 phone


of
 course
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 new
 in


many
 other
 devices
 and
 so
 it's
 very


exciting
 because
 our
 industry
 comes
 from


this
 voice
 interaction
 we've
 moved
 to


data
 now
 everything
 is
 IP
 etc
 but
 voice


will
 be
 important
 the
 latency
 that
 we


require
 to
 have
 this
 type
 of


conversation
 between
 humans
 is
 a
 very


low
 latency.
 You
 you
 feel
 it
 immediately


if
 it's
 not
 the
 latency
 that's
 required


for
 voice
 and
 that's
 actually
 that
 puts


that
 puts
 challenge
 on
 our
 networks
 if


you
 really
 want
 to
 have
 that
 experience


with
 an
 AI
 translator
 for
 instance
 or


with
 a
 an
 AI
 agent
 and
 and
 getting
 this


voice
 experience.
 Now
 if
 the
 agent
 is
 on


your
 mobile
 phone
 latency
 can
 be


managed.
 I
 mean
 assuming
 you
 have
 the


right
 compute
 power
 in
 your
 mobile


phone.
 So,
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


technology
 challenges
 behind
 but
 but


this
 experience
 of
 voice
 in
 in
 the
 tech


world
 is
 really
 different
 from
 this
 best


effort
 environment
 which
 we've
 built


with
 data
 and
 IP
 and
 video
 so
 far.


>> So
 if
 we
 now
 now
 if
 you
 speak
 French
 and


I
 speak
 Norwegian


um
 what
 would
 that
 conversation
 look


like
 if
 we
 had
 uh


live
 translation?
 What
 kind
 of
 late
 what


kind
 of
 delays
 would
 there
 be?
 Well,


that
 should
 be
 the
 objective
 to
 have
 a


natural
 conversation.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 people
 using
 their
 natural


language.


>> And
 when
 will
 we
 have
 that?


>> Uh
 well,
 that's
 I
 mean
 today
 the


technology
 is
 not
 at
 the
 right
 uh
 level.


uh
 or
 today
 the
 technology
 starts
 from


voice
 translates
 with
 text
 translate
 to


so
 you
 have
 voice
 text
 text
 voice
 to
 for


that
 to
 happen
 you
 need
 voice
 really
 a


voice
 uh
 type
 of
 uh
 of
 direct
 interface


to
 get
 the
 low
 latency
 uh
 so
 there's
 I


mean
 you
 have
 some
 experience
 but
 to
 get


it
 at
 scale
 on
 our
 networks
 it's
 going


to
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 uh
 it's
 going
 to


take
 a
 few
 years
 but
 it's
 not
 decades


it's
 really


>> it'd
 be
 cool


>> I
 think
 for
 Europe
 Europe
 if
 you
 think


of
 it
 I
 mean
 the
 US
 or
 the
 China
 market


they
 benefit
 from
 one
 language
 one
 of


the
 issue
 in
 Europe
 issue
 strength
 let's


put
 it
 that
 way
 the
 diversity
 of


languages
 and
 culture
 if
 AI
 could
 help


reduce
 the
 barriers
 and
 uh
 between


people
 that
 would
 be
 cool
 now
 I
 don't


think
 we
 should
 stop
 studying
 languages


because
 it's
 also
 studying
 cultures
 and


understanding
 each
 other


>> yeah
 well
 you
 are
 in
 a
 way
 multicultural


right


>> married
 to
 a
 German
 and
 uh
 raising


children
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 languages
 so
 you


know
 all
 about


Um,
 moving
 on
 now.
 Um,
 what
 kind
 of


things
 should
 a
 comp
 a
 telecom
 company


do?


>> I
 mean,
 you're
 into
 money.
 Uh,


>> where
 where
 what's
 core?
 What's
 not


core?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 good
 question


because
 we've
 tried
 to
 diversify.
 I


think
 all
 telecom
 operators
 have
 tried


to
 diversify
 sometime
 unsuccessfully.


For
 us,
 I
 mean,
 we
 we
 tried
 to
 create
 a


bank
 and
 and
 we
 decided
 to
 to
 move
 away


from
 it.
 The
 real
 question
 is
 what
 do


your
 customers
 expect
 you
 to
 to
 to


provide
 to
 them.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 I
 mean


come
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 come
 to
 us


and
 they
 see
 the
 power
 of
 having
 the


customer
 base.
 We
 have
 the
 network
 that


so
 as
 a
 distributor
 of
 technology
 we


actually
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 and and


that
 doesn't
 mean
 you
 need
 to
 do
 it


yourself
 which
 was
 the
 case
 in
 in
 terms


of
 creating
 the
 bank.
 So
 you
 can
 be
 a


distributor.
 Of
 course,
 cyber
 security


is
 something
 that
 is
 an
 adjacency
 which


we've
 developed
 and
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


because
 we
 want
 to
 be
 a
 trusted
 partner


and
 I
 think
 the
 more
 we
 progress
 the


more
 AI
 is
 rolled
 out
 this
 notion
 of


trust
 in
 our
 relationship
 with
 customers


with
 I
 mean
 governments
 is
 going
 to
 be


very
 important
 with
 companies
 as
 well.


So
 we
 want
 to
 really
 put
 trust
 at
 the


heart
 of
 everything
 we
 do
 which
 is
 which


means
 that
 you
 can
 actually
 add
 a
 lot
 of


adjacencies
 behind
 this
 concept
 of
 of


trust
 because
 I
 mean
 we
 we
 do
 I
 mean


infrastructure
 for
 instance
 for
 us


infrastructure
 is
 of
 course
 something


that
 we
 use
 for
 for
 for
 our
 networks
 but


but
 think
 of
 it
 we
 have
 submarine
 cables


we
 have
 vessels
 to
 repair
 submarine


cables
 and
 and
 we
 consider
 that
 this
 is


part
 of
 of
 our
 business
 line
 around


valuing
 infrastructure
 which
 which
 we


think
 many
 telos
 have
 moved
 away
 because


they
 had
 to
 we
 think
 that's
 a


fundamental
 value
 that's
 that's
 in
 the


company
 to
 to
 be
 in
 this
 infrastructure


layer
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 services
 I
 was


saying
 cyber
 security
 but
 we
 are
 we
 are


reselling
 or
 or
 or
 innovating
 with
 many


type
 of
 services
 in
 so
 we
 home
 security


also
 we
 do
 that
 uh
 in
 France
 in
 Spain
 uh


we
 are
 reselling
 energy
 in
 some


countries
 sometimes
 successfully


sometime
 unsuccessfully
 but
 in
 any
 case


insurance
 is
 something
 we
 do
 as
 well.
 In


any
 case,
 the
 diversification
 of


services


remains
 something
 that
 has
 not
 been
 and


I
 think
 even
 the
 telos
 who
 have
 been
 the


most
 advanced
 it
 it
 limits
 to
 10%
 of
 our


total
 uh
 total
 turnover.
 So
 now
 in
 the


B2B
 space
 for
 instance
 cloud
 AI
 cyber


security
 for
 sure
 are
 big


diversification
 that
 we've
 made
 and
 that


we
 will
 continue
 to
 invest
 on
 compared


to
 the
 traditional
 connectivity.
 Of


course,


>> you
 have
 a
 technical
 background
 and


spent
 time
 at
 uh
 Boston
 Consulting


Group,
 Alcatalusent


uh
 and
 Schneider.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 that


background
 uh
 is
 forming
 how
 you
 think


about
 strategy?
 Well,
 I
 think
 that
 I


mean
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 go
 deep
 in


understanding
 the
 technology,
 but
 being


able
 to
 to
 ask
 question
 to
 engineers
 to


really
 and
 I
 like
 to
 to
 understand
 some


of
 the
 technical
 challenge
 we
 have
 and


and
 and
 so
 being
 able
 to
 to
 dive
 I
 mean


we
 could
 talk
 about
 quantum
 for


instance.
 I
 mean
 I
 stud
 I
 studied


quantum
 physics
 when
 I
 was
 at
 school.
 I


find
 it
 fascinating
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 are
 behind
 this
 disruption


technology
 disruption
 with
 with
 quantum.


So
 being
 able
 to
 to
 to
 understand
 some


of
 those
 challenges
 and
 I
 think
 we
 live


in
 a
 world
 where
 technology
 is


everywhere
 and
 disruption
 has
 come
 as


much
 from
 great
 customer
 experience
 as


from
 deep
 technology
 I
 mean
 the


disruption.
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 my
 engineering


background
 is
 really
 trying
 to


understand
 in
 a
 more
 systemic
 approach


the
 impact
 of
 technology
 never
 I
 mean


technology
 sometime
 we
 we
 technology
 can


be
 seen
 as
 a
 as
 a
 we
 are
 technology


pushers
 instead
 of
 being
 a
 solution
 or


or
 problem
 fixers
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that's


the
 challenge
 of
 of
 engineers
 that


sometime
 we
 we we
 love
 to
 build
 very


complex
 solution
 to
 a
 problem
 that
 may


not
 exist
 so
 so
 that's
 where
 my
 engineer


background
 is
 also
 So
 very
 balanced
 by


my
 very
 pragmatic


leadership
 style
 which
 is
 okay
 this
 is


way
 too
 complex
 explain
 to
 me
 very


simply
 what's
 the
 problem
 we're
 trying


to
 fix.
 So
 and
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 to


both
 when
 you
 run
 a
 big
 company
 but


being
 able
 to
 go
 deep
 and
 really


spending
 time
 with
 engineers
 and
 is
 also


fascinating
 especially
 in
 a
 in
 a
 company


that
 invests
 so
 much
 in
 technology.


>> Tell
 me
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 your
 leadership


style.
 Well,
 I'm
 um
 I'm
 someone
 pretty


direct,
 so
 I
 I I
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 waste


time
 in
 meetings
 when
 people
 try
 to
 not


say
 things
 or
 when
 we
 don't
 put
 the
 real


issues
 on
 the
 table.
 Uh
 but
 I'm
 a
 very


energetic
 person
 and
 I
 think
 uh
 I've
 had


that
 I've
 learned
 that
 from
 one
 of
 CEOs


I
 work
 for
 in
 in
 the
 past
 who
 was


saying,
 you
 know,
 in
 companies
 you
 have


energy
 givers
 and
 energy
 takers.
 I'm


definitely
 an
 energy
 giver
 and
 I
 think


to
 run
 a
 company
 of
 the
 size
 of
 orange


and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 get
 excited


by
 indeed
 I
 mean
 hiking
 mountains


addressing
 challenging
 winning
 together


I
 think
 this
 positive
 mindset
 of
 I
 mean


providing
 energy
 to
 everyone
 to


accomplish
 big
 challenges
 I
 think
 is


fantastic
 to
 move


>> well
 you
 know
 CEO
 stands
 for
 chief


energy
 officer


>> chief
 energy
 officer


>> yeah
 where
 does
 your
 energy
 come
 from


what
 what
 is
 energy


>> well
 for
 me
 you
 know
 I
 wake
 up
 every


morning
 and
 I'm
 like
 happy
 actually
 the


more
 challenges
 we
 face


it's
 not
 that
 the
 more
 excited
 because


frankly
 speaking
 managing
 crisis
 is
 not


something
 that's
 exciting
 but
 but


somehow


I
 get
 excited
 by
 challenges
 and
 the


bigger
 the
 challenges
 the
 more
 excited
 I


am
 and
 it's
 it
 comes
 from
 I
 think
 I've


had
 I
 mean
 part
 of
 it
 is
 I
 was
 lucky
 and


I
 was
 born
 under
 the
 the
 right
 star
 I


guess
 but
 but
 part
 of
 it
 is
 because
 I've


seen
 the
 power
 of
 winning
 with
 teams
 and


I've
 seen
 that
 when
 I
 was
 an
 account


manager
 and
 winning
 a
 deal
 where


everyone
 thinks
 you're
 going
 to
 lose
 a


deal
 and
 then
 suddenly
 you
 see
 this


pride
 and
 the
 the the
 the
 spirit
 of
 and


so
 this
 winning
 mindset
 is
 extremely


powerful
 to
 to
 climb
 mountains
 and
 I


think


>> who
 do
 you
 trying
 to
 show
 who
 do
 you


want
 to
 prove


>> nobody
 myself


>> no
 parents
 or


>> no
 of
 course
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 my
 parents


are
 very
 proud
 of
 where
 I
 am
 today
 and


so
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 I
 don't
 think
 they


really
 they
 still
 struggle
 to
 understand


what
 is
 it
 like
 your
 gender
 you
 know


they
 my
 My
 mother
 was
 a
 professor
 in


university
 so
 she
 understands
 what
 it
 is


but
 going
 from
 meetings
 to
 meetings
 not


really
 understanding
 what
 I
 do
 in


meetings
 is
 something
 a
 bit
 weird
 but
 of


course
 no
 I
 want
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 I'm
 more


excited
 by
 the
 impact
 I
 can
 have
 on
 the


the
 people
 I
 work
 with
 and
 and
 and


that's
 why
 this
 winning
 spirit
 and
 you


know
 showing
 to
 people
 that
 sometime


people
 feel
 that
 things
 are
 impossible


and
 then
 they
 realize
 that
 actually
 with


hard
 work
 teamwork
 things
 are
 possible.


>> Did
 you
 do
 competitive
 sport?
 Not
 at


all.


>> No.


>> I
 was
 dancing,
 I'm
 running,
 and
 I'm


swimming.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 I
 I'm
 But
 I
 have


this
 very
 competitive
 mindset
 where
 I


like
 to
 win.


>> And
 where
 does
 it
 come
 from?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe


because
 I
 was
 the
 elder
 sister
 and
 I


have
 two
 twin
 sisters
 who
 push
 me,
 you


know,
 I
 had
 to
 to
 fight
 at
 home.
 So


maybe
 that's
 where.


>> How
 has
 your
 leadership
 style
 changed


with
 with
 age
 and
 experience?


>> I
 think
 I'm
 still


genuine.
 I
 mean
 some
 of
 it
 of
 course


experience
 is
 that
 I
 go
 faster
 to
 to
 to


addressing
 issues
 you
 know
 when
 when


you're
 when
 I
 was
 a
 younger
 leader
 I


would
 sometime
 you
 know
 say
 look
 I
 mean


politics
 there
 are
 things
 you
 can
 say


things
 you
 cannot
 say
 etc
 and
 now
 I've


learned
 that
 I
 mean
 time
 is
 really
 the


scarce
 resource
 in
 my
 job
 and
 so
 making


sure
 that
 every
 time
 I
 see
 a
 small
 issue


I
 address
 it
 with
 can
 be
 even
 people


relationship
 in
 in
 my
 team
 or
 with
 with


people
 I
 work
 with.
 And
 so
 I'd
 rather


pick
 up
 the
 phone
 and
 say,
 "Look,
 is


there
 an
 issue
 here?"
 And
 sometime
 you


realize
 there's
 a
 big
 issue
 that
 people


are
 trying
 to
 hide
 and
 so
 you
 can


address
 it.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 being
 uh
 being


probably
 more
 direct
 and
 and
 addressing


things
 uh
 more
 openly
 is
 even
 more


present
 now
 than
 it
 was
 when
 I
 was
 a


young
 leader
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what


are
 the
 things
 you
 can
 say,
 you
 cannot


say.


>> Are
 people
 generally
 direct
 in
 Orange


with
 a
 feedback?


>> I
 think
 they
 were
 not.
 And
 actually
 we


had
 our
 leadership
 meeting
 where
 we


gather
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 mean
 all
 our
 leaders


in
 the
 company
 and
 I've
 been
 very


explicit
 with
 them
 that
 I
 want
 people
 to


come
 to
 me
 with
 don't
 tell
 me
 what
 you


think
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 and
 when
 I
 say


something
 I
 expect
 you
 to
 say
 I
 disagree


because
 we
 need
 to
 have
 debates.


>> How
 long
 time
 does
 it
 take
 to
 get
 that


type
 of
 attitude
 into
 a
 company?


>> Oh
 years
 I
 mean
 culture
 is
 something


that
 we're
 working
 on
 but
 it
 takes
 years


to
 change
 a
 company
 culture.
 And
 and
 and


by
 the
 way,
 it
 starts
 from
 the
 top.


>> Oh,
 totally.
 What
 part
 of
 the
 orange


culture
 are
 you
 try
 are
 you
 still
 trying


to
 change?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 you
 know,
 we've
 we've


defined
 our
 company
 values
 and
 there


there
 are
 there's
 one
 that's
 very


important
 which
 is
 boldness.
 And
 I
 think


as
 a
 company
 we
 we're
 very
 good
 at


managing
 risk
 and
 but
 this
 boldness
 and


and
 which
 means
 willing
 to
 test,
 willing


to
 learn
 from
 failures,
 accepting


failures
 and
 speaking
 about
 failures.
 We


tend
 to
 have
 a
 culture
 where
 we
 talk
 a


lot
 about
 the
 things
 that
 work
 well


>> but
 we
 don't
 talk
 about
 the
 things
 that


do
 not
 work
 and
 and and
 that's
 my
 direct


style
 but
 also
 making
 sure
 companies


grow
 only
 you
 learn
 more
 from
 actually


failures
 and
 mistakes
 than
 from
 things


that
 work
 well
 because
 sometime
 you're


just
 lucky
 and
 things
 go
 well
 but


actually
 you
 can
 learn
 a
 lot
 more
 from


failures.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 system
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 you


prioritize
 your
 time?


>> Well,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 master
 at


that.
 I'm
 still
 working
 on
 it
 because


time
 is
 really
 the
 challenge.
 But
 yeah,


I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 system.
 I
 try
 to
 all


the
 Fridays
 in
 my
 agenda
 are
 free
 up


from
 meetings
 until
 the
 week
 starts
 and


then
 I
 can
 add
 the
 but
 Friday
 is
 the
 day


when
 I
 like
 to
 think
 do
 things
 that
 can


be
 so
 can
 be
 urgent
 things
 or
 can
 be


thinking
 and
 and
 and
 planning
 and
 and


stepping
 back
 and
 and
 meeting
 with


people
 that
 may
 not
 be
 directly
 in
 the


in
 the
 agenda.


>> And
 are
 you
 in
 the
 office
 every
 day?
 I
 I


mean
 I
 travel
 because
 I
 like
 to
 go
 in


the
 field
 but
 otherwise
 yeah
 I'm
 in
 the


office
 I
 don't
 work
 from
 home


>> in
 terms
 of
 this
 direct
 feedback
 and
 so


on
 you
 have
 a
 uh
 the
 state
 has
 a
 stake


in
 you
 right


>> the
 French
 government
 owns
 23%
 yeah


>> do
 you
 think
 that
 impacts
 your
 corporate


culture
 are
 you
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 stateowned


type
 of
 thing


>> I
 mean
 of
 course
 historically
 we
 still


have
 civil
 servants
 at
 orange


>> and
 so
 part
 of
 the
 culture
 in
 France
 or


in
 some
 other
 countries
 where
 we
 were


incumbent
 is
 coming
 from
 this


administration
 mindset


>> now
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 came
 in
 the
 company


long
 after
 but
 definitely
 in
 the
 company


culture
 there's
 part
 of
 it
 which
 is
 I


mean
 coming
 from
 the
 administration


world


>> and
 how
 do
 you
 change
 that
 part
 of
 it


>> well
 that's
 all
 the
 things
 we're
 doing


which
 is
 there
 are
 good
 things
 that
 come


with
 this
 so
 we
 we're
 trying
 to
 keep


what
 what
 is
 good
 because
 I
 mean
 what
 is


good
 what
 is
 good


>> well
 the
 good
 thing
 is
 that
 this
 deep
 I


mean
 willingness
 to
 serve
 customers
 and


and
 and
 you
 know
 people
 when
 there's
 a


storm
 and
 the
 network
 is
 down
 people


don't
 count
 their
 hours
 they
 just
 go
 in


the
 field
 And
 we
 had
 this
 this
 big
 uh


big
 storm
 in
 Mayot
 where
 the
 network
 was


completely
 crashed
 and
 we
 had
 people
 who


lost
 their
 house
 still
 the
 employ
 the
 I


mean
 our
 colleagues
 were
 coming
 to
 work


repairing
 the
 network
 even
 though
 they


had
 lost
 their
 house.
 So
 that's
 really


deep
 in
 our
 in
 our
 in
 our
 and
 that
 may


come
 from
 this
 civil
 servant
 culture


even
 though
 it
 were
 not
 coming
 from
 the


administration
 in
 every
 country.
 So


that's
 very
 powerful.
 Of
 course,
 some
 of


the
 things
 which
 are
 maybe
 more
 I
 mean


you
 take
 I
 mean
 leadership
 development,


talent
 talent
 uh
 development.
 I
 don't


think
 administrations
 are
 are
 they
 tend


to
 manage
 people
 more
 equally
 and
 I


think
 that's
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we're


we're
 we're
 addressing.


>> What's
 the
 best
 carrier
 advice
 you
 ever


got?


>> Uh
 actually
 I've
 had
 a
 lot
 and
 I
 did
 not


follow
 all
 of
 them
 because
 I
 tend
 to
 No.


And
 and
 I've
 worked
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 great


>> CEOs.
 What's
 the
 ones
 you
 haven't


followed
 which
 you
 are
 glad
 you
 didn't


follow?


>> Uh
 you
 know
 I've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 advice


actually
 I
 had
 one
 advice
 which
 was


don't
 join
 the
 orange
 board
 of
 directors


because
 I
 had
 proposal
 to
 join
 two


boards.
 I
 would
 not
 be
 the
 sea
 of
 orange


today
 if
 I
 had
 not
 jo.
 So
 I
 did
 not


follow
 that
 advice
 which
 was


>> But
 you
 were
 on
 the
 board
 for
 five
 years


before.


>> I
 was
 on
 the
 board
 for
 five
 years
 and
 uh


and
 and and
 I
 and
 my
 instinct
 was
 I


should
 join
 this
 orange
 board
 because


I've
 been
 in
 the
 telecom
 industry
 for
 15


years.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 value
 as
 as


a
 board
 uh
 as
 a
 director
 on
 the
 board.


But
 I
 mean
 that's
 one
 one
 example.
 But


but
 I
 think
 sometime
 I've
 had
 advice
 on


uh
 don't
 take
 that
 job
 too
 risky.
 And


actually
 I'm
 like,
 well
 maybe
 if
 it's


risky
 that
 means
 okay
 I
 can
 fail
 but
 I'm


going
 to
 learn
 and
 if
 I
 succeed
 then


I'll
 be
 more
 visible
 because
 guess
 what


nobody
 would
 expect
 me
 to
 to
 succeed.
 So


>> and
 where
 do
 you
 get
 that
 risk
 appetite


from?


>> I
 think
 and
 that's
 something
 I
 tell
 I


mean
 when
 people
 ask
 me
 advice
 in
 for


young
 people
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 get
 bored.


So
 every
 time
 there's
 new
 technology


crisis,
 not
 that
 much,
 but
 I
 mean
 new


challenge
 to
 to
 overcome
 or
 new
 project


to
 win,
 I
 like
 this
 idea
 that
 we're


going
 to
 learn
 together
 and
 do
 great


things
 together.
 And
 I've
 had
 that
 I


mean
 again
 this
 is
 this
 this
 winning


mindset
 which
 is
 it's
 much
 better
 to
 win


big
 things
 than
 just
 to
 win
 small


things.
 And
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 get
 bored.


So
 when
 I
 feel
 I'm
 not
 learning,
 which


I'm
 not
 bored
 these
 days.
 We
 learn,
 we


learn
 every
 day
 is
 bringing
 new
 things.


But
 but
 in
 my


>> and
 if
 you
 were
 to
 turn
 this
 around
 and


actually
 uh
 make
 this
 internet
 advice


for
 young
 people,
 which
 we
 all
 always
 do


at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 podcast,
 what
 would


you
 tell
 them?


>> Uh
 it's
 really
 if
 you
 go
 to
 work
 and
 you


feel
 you're
 getting
 bored,
 I
 mean
 have


the
 courage
 to
 to
 to
 move
 on
 and
 move


out
 of
 your
 comfort
 zone.
 And
 of
 course


being
 bored
 sometime
 is
 good
 because


that
 means
 you're
 you
 also
 you
 have
 some


time.
 But
 but
 if
 you
 get
 bored
 and
 you


just
 go
 to
 work
 thinking
 well
 I
 just
 go


to
 work.
 I
 mean
 when
 people
 are
 young
 I


mean
 they
 have
 their
 entire
 life
 to
 to


to
 accomplish.
 Life
 life
 is
 always
 too


short
 actually.
 So
 don't
 get
 bored.
 I


mean
 knock
 on
 the
 doors
 of
 other
 people


or
 talk
 to
 your
 managers.
 In
 my
 case


when
 I
 was
 getting
 bored
 in
 my
 jobs
 I've


always
 I
 went
 to
 my
 manager
 and
 say
 well


I
 think
 I'm
 not
 learning
 anymore.
 What


can
 I
 do
 more?
 which
 doesn't
 mean


changing
 job
 but
 at least
 making
 sure


you
 you
 you
 ask
 for
 it.


>> Well,
 Crystal,
 uh
 life
 is
 short.
 Uh
 time


is
 uh
 scarcity
 and
 we
 are
 really
 happy


that
 you
 spent
 some
 time
 with
 us.
 We've


learned
 so
 much.
 Big
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 time.


>> Thank
 you.
