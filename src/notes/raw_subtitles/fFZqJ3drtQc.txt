Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 September


17th
 and
 this
 is
 my
 September
 FOMC


debrief.
 So
 I
 just
 finished
 watching


JPAL's
 presser
 and
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 a


pretty
 good
 press
 conference
 and
 a


pretty
 interesting
 meeting.
 So
 we
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 stuff
 to
 talk
 about.
 However,


as
 usual,
 let's
 first
 level
 set.
 Now


between
 this
 meeting
 and
 the
 last


meeting,
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 happen
 on


the
 labor
 market
 front.
 As
 we've
 been


discussing,
 the
 labor
 market
 has
 been


pretty
 disappointing.
 A
 whole
 bunch
 of


jobs
 that
 we
 thought
 we
 had
 were
 revised


away
 and
 the
 most
 recent
 jobs
 report
 was


pretty
 disappointing
 where
 jobs
 you
 know


about
 20ome,000
 created
 lower
 than


expectations.
 However,
 the
 unemployment


rate
 remains
 pretty
 low
 at
 around
 4.3%.


Now
 looking
 on
 the
 inflation
 side,


things
 really
 haven't
 been
 improving


either.
 Uh
 taking
 a
 step
 back,
 it
 really


looks
 like
 inflation
 is
 stuck
 at
 about


3%.
 And
 looking
 ahead,
 there
 doesn't


seem
 to
 be
 a
 path
 for
 inflation
 to
 come


down.
 Actually,
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 good


argument
 that
 inflation
 could
 actually


tick
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 account
 of


tariffs.
 So,
 if
 you're
 the
 Fed
 looking


for
 2%
 inflation
 and
 full
 employment,


you
 know,
 you're
 kind
 of
 not
 doing
 very


well
 on
 either
 mandate.
 So,
 you're
 in
 a


pretty
 tough
 position.


Now,
 we
 all
 knew
 since
 Cher
 Powell


telegraphed
 that
 at
 Jackson
 Hall
 that
 he


would
 be
 cutting
 rates
 today.
 So
 the


market
 had
 fully
 priced
 in
 a
 25
 basis


point
 cut.
 Now
 heading
 into
 this
 meeting


there
 were
 a
 few
 questions.
 Well
 first


off
 on
 the
 political
 front
 we
 have
 the


newly
 sworn
 in
 finit
 distinguished
 finit


alum
 Steve
 Meyer
 joining
 as
 Governor


Meyer
 as
 his
 first
 meeting.
 We
 also
 have


Governor
 Cook
 who
 was
 fired
 by
 the


president
 and
 reinstated
 by
 the
 court
 of


appeals.
 So
 you
 had
 some
 interesting


dynamics
 there.
 Um
 wasn't
 sure
 if
 there


would
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 dissents.
 Maybe
 some


people
 wanted
 50
 basis
 points.
 Maybe


some
 people
 didn't
 want
 to
 cut
 at
 all.


So
 that
 was
 a
 question
 mark.
 There's


always
 of
 course
 on
 the
 margins
 some


people
 hoping
 for
 a
 50
 basis
 point
 cut.


And
 of
 course
 for
 me
 of
 course
 the


biggest
 question
 was
 how
 uh
 the
 Fed


would
 project
 its
 dot
 plots
 in
 2026
 and


2027.


Now
 heading
 into
 this
 meeting
 like
 we


discussed
 market
 fully
 priced
 in
 25


basis
 point
 cut
 and
 also
 let's
 say
 25


for
 each
 of
 the
 meetings
 for
 throughout


the
 end
 of
 this
 year.
 However,
 the


market
 also
 priced
 in
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


cuts
 for
 2026


going
 as
 low
 as
 2.9%
 in
 December
 2026.


That
 is
 actually
 much
 lower
 than
 uh
 the


June
 dot
 plot.
 And
 so
 there
 was
 kind
 of


a
 big
 disconnect
 where
 the
 market
 was


thinking
 and
 where
 uh
 where
 the
 Fed
 had


guided
 towards
 in
 June.
 And
 you
 know
 as


I
 wrote
 about
 on
 Monday
 my
 my
 perception


was
 that
 the
 the
 market
 would
 be
 uh


forced
 to
 move
 to
 the
 bit
 uh
 hawkishly


to
 the
 Fed
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 today.
 So


those
 were
 the
 questions
 heading
 into
 uh


the
 meeting
 today.
 Now
 at
 the
 meeting


again
 immediately
 we
 got
 the
 25
 basis


point
 cut
 as
 expected.
 No
 50
 basis
 point


cut.
 That
 was
 always
 very
 very
 unlikely.


And
 we
 did
 get
 a
 descent
 and
 that


descent
 of
 course
 comes
 from
 Governor


Myron
 who
 wanted
 50
 basis
 points.


Uh
 no
 other
 descent.
 So
 it
 looks
 like


the
 FOMC
 uh
 as
 as
 a
 whole
 is
 still


pretty
 cohesive
 on
 on
 that
 front.
 Now


more
 interesting
 thing
 is
 looking
 at
 the


dot
 plot.
 Now,
 looking
 at
 the
 dot
 plot,


no,
 the
 the
 the
 dot
 plot
 really
 didn't


really
 change
 that
 much
 between
 uh
 this


meeting
 and
 the
 last
 meeting.
 Looks
 like


the
 Fed
 basically
 just
 penciled
 in
 an


extra
 cut.
 So,
 again,
 the
 Dow
 plot
 is


much
 more
 hawkish
 than
 was
 priced
 into


the
 market.
 And
 on
 the
 actually
 the


economic
 forecast
 front,
 looks
 like
 the


Fed


marked
 down
 their
 unemployment
 rate
 a


little
 bit.
 So,
 a
 little
 bit
 better


growth
 and
 marked
 up
 their
 inflation
 a


little
 bit.
 So
 inflation
 a
 little
 bit


worse.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 they're


looking
 at
 it.
 One
 of
 course
 very


interesting
 thing
 is
 that
 when
 you
 break


out
 the
 dot
 plot
 as
 to
 where
 the


committee
 members
 stand
 with
 respect
 to


rates
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2025,
 you
 you'll


notice
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 them
 are


clustered
 around
 um
 you
 know
 say
 4%
 or


something
 like
 that.
 And
 there's
 this


one
 dot
 that
 is
 very
 very
 low
 that
 is


actually
 looking
 for
 50
 basis
 point
 cut


in
 each
 of
 the
 last
 three
 meetings
 this


year.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 we
 can
 all
 guess


who
 that
 is.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,
 going
 to
 the


um
 PA
 press
 conference
 again,
 I
 think


there
 were
 two
 things
 that
 really
 stood


out
 to
 me.
 Well,
 actually,
 I
 I'll
 say


three
 things.
 Well,
 first
 off,
 what's


his
 rationale
 for
 cutting
 rates
 today?
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 mean,
 yeah.
 So,
 what


does
 he
 say?
 So,
 Powell
 basically
 says


that
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 not
 as
 strong


as
 he
 thought
 it
 was.
 Over
 the
 past
 few


meetings,
 Powell
 had
 repeatedly
 asserted


that
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 doing
 really


well.
 I
 mean
 looking
 looking
 at
 the


unemployment
 rate
 and
 so
 his
 focus
 was


mostly
 on
 inflation.


Now
 he
 mentioned
 that
 uh
 looking
 at
 the


revised
 data
 the
 labor
 market
 really


doesn't
 look
 as
 good
 as
 he
 thought
 and


so
 you
 know
 the
 the
 risks
 are
 a
 bit
 more


two-sided
 now.
 He
 can't
 really
 just
 all


think
 that
 much
 on
 on
 inflation
 and
 he


also
 suggested
 that
 you
 know
 inflation


is
 uh
 not
 as
 worrisome
 as
 he
 used
 to


think.
 So
 I
 take
 that
 to
 mean
 that


inflation
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 stuck


at
 around
 3%.
 It's
 probably
 not
 going
 to


get
 worse
 to
 four
 or
 five
 6%.
 Now
 during


the
 pandemic
 it
 was
 super
 high.
 That
 was


totally
 unacceptable.
 Uh
 but
 my
 sense
 is


that
 3%
 inflation
 is
 actually
 okay
 to


him.


Uh
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 I
 thought
 was


super
 interesting
 is
 how
 he
 perceived
 uh


the
 upcoming
 job
 numbers.
 So
 as
 we


mentioned
 last
 month
 we
 only
 created


20ome,000
 jobs
 and
 actually
 in
 June


after
 revisions
 we
 actually
 had
 a


negative
 job
 number.
 So
 his
 perspective


was
 that


a
 lot
 of
 the
 weakness
 the
 perceived


weakness
 in
 the
 labor
 market
 really
 is


just
 due
 to
 immigration
 supply
 and


demand
 dynamics
 over
 there.
 So
 he


thought
 that
 you
 know
 a
 break
 even
 job


growth
 because
 of
 our
 red
 reduced


immigration
 is
 between
 0
 to
 50,000.


So
 any
 number
 according
 to
 this


perspective
 any
 number
 of
 we
 get
 from


the
 NFP
 report
 going
 forward
 if
 it's


between
 zero
 and
 50,000
 it
 it's
 probably


okay
 because
 you
 know
 we
 should
 expect


low
 job
 growth
 because
 we
 have
 lower


population
 growth.
 Now
 uh
 one
 Gberger


who
 is
 a
 smart
 person
 who
 focuses
 on


employment
 also
 suggested
 that
 you
 know


they
 kind
 of
 just
 look
 at
 the


unemployment
 rate
 to
 kind
 of
 derive
 what


the
 break
 even
 number
 is.
 So
 that's
 kind


of
 a
 the
 headline
 number
 is
 not
 super


important
 but
 really
 what
 matters
 is
 the


unemployment
 rate
 and
 I
 think
 that
 makes


sense
 as
 well.
 Uh
 in
 any
 case,
 based
 on


where
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 is
 today
 and


based
 on
 the
 job
 growth
 numbers
 we've


seen
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months,
 it
 seems


that
 uh
 it's
 correct
 that
 the
 economy


because
 of
 low
 population
 growth,
 these


low
 job
 numbers
 actually
 actually
 don't


seem
 to
 be
 super
 concerning.
 Though
 of


course,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 other
 things
 like


wages
 and
 so
 forth,
 it
 does
 seem
 the


labor
 market
 continues
 to
 weaken.
 All


right,
 so
 that
 means
 that
 uh
 actually
 a


pretty
 hawkish
 perspective
 really.
 It


means
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


super
 worried
 about


uh
 the
 loop
 the
 lower
 job
 growth
 uh


numbers
 going
 forward.
 And
 another
 thing


that
 I
 thought
 was
 pretty
 interesting
 he


mentioned
 was
 his
 perspective
 on


tariffs.
 Now,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


tariffs
 for
 months
 and
 initially
 what
 I


was
 telling
 you
 guys
 is
 that
 just


looking
 at
 the
 past
 what
 happened
 2017


2018
 is
 that
 the
 distributors
 like
 the


middlemen
 they
 ate
 the
 tariffs
 as
 profit


through
 through
 lower
 profits
 and
 they


really
 weren't
 passed
 through
 the


consumers
 and
 that's
 really
 what


happened
 based
 on
 studies
 looking
 at


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 p
 of
 prices
 in


2018
 and
 2019
 and
 pow
 basically
 are


saying
 right
 now
 that
 yeah
 that's
 kind


of
 what's
 happening
 right
 now
 um
 all


these
 distributors.
 They're
 eating
 the


cost,
 eating
 the
 tariffs.
 They
 plan
 on


passing
 this
 on
 to
 consumers,
 but


they're
 having
 trouble,
 too.
 So,
 he's


saying
 that
 pass
 through
 could
 be
 very


slow
 and
 and
 very
 low.
 So,


at
 the
 moment,
 there
 really
 just
 doesn't


seem
 to
 have
 been
 a
 very
 big
 uh
 impact


from
 tariffs
 on
 inflation.
 So
 uh
 that


could
 come
 going
 forward
 but
 uh
 if
 the


economy
 weakens
 and
 the
 FOMC
 is


projecting
 below
 uh
 below
 trend
 growth


and
 I
 also
 am
 quite
 negative
 on
 the


economy.
 So
 that
 won't
 be
 passed
 through


and
 it
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 eaten
 by
 the


by
 the
 distributors.
 So
 it
 looks
 like


everyone
 who
 is
 afraid
 of
 massive


inflation
 from
 tariffs
 does
 not
 have
 to


be
 afraid.


Um
 I
 think
 that's
 all
 right
 now.
 So


going
 forward
 I
 think
 we'll
 just
 um


See,
 just
 looking
 more
 closely
 on
 the


employment
 market
 and
 that's
 that's


going
 to
 be
 what
 happens.
 Again,
 the


market
 is
 fully
 pricing
 in
 uh
 another


rate
 cut
 at
 the
 next
 meeting
 and
 another


rate
 cut
 in
 December.
 And
 beyond
 that


though,
 I
 think
 we'll
 just
 have
 to
 see


who
 the
 composition
 of
 the
 FOMC
 is.
 uh


because
 personnel
 changes
 uh
 either
 what


happens
 with
 Governor
 Cook
 or
 you
 know


who
 the
 next
 Fed
 chair
 is
 and
 of
 course


whether
 or
 not
 Cher
 Powell
 will
 leave


after
 his
 term
 as
 fetchure
 is
 over.


Those
 are
 the
 questions
 that
 will
 shape


the
 rates
 market
 uh
 for
 next
 year.
 All


right,
 that's
 all
 I
 prepared.
 Talk
 to


you
 guys
 on
 Saturday.
