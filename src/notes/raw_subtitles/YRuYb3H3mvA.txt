Is Russia's economy about to collapse?
So far, these predictions
have always proved wrong.
But now, with oil prices down, a new
Russia collapse narrative has emerged
which essentially says that war has been
a huge stimulus for the Russian economy.
But they can't continue
doing this forever.
The reality is,
they're likely to run out of money.
Therefore, as US Treasury Secretary Scott
Bessent recently said,
we are in a race now
between how long can Ukrainian
military hold up versus
how long can the Russian economy hold up?
So despite getting it wrong earlier,
lots of really good Western economists
now again think Russia's war
economy is heading for a collapse.
And yet here you are
listening to this economist on YouTube,
no less, telling you
that if we look at the four main ways
that historic economies have collapsed,
there really are
not many signs that Russia's economy
is about to collapse.
In fact, if you compare Russia's war
economy to historical ones like
Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union,
and even Vietnam era USA,
it actually looks like Russia's war
economy is just getting started.
To see why,
let's do a quick recap of why Russia's war
economy has surprised most analysts
so far.
After all, since the war, Russia's economy
so far has actually outperformed
major European economies
like the UK and Germany.
So why did most analysts get it so wrong?
Well, in my view, the most likely reason
is that they have been trained
to understand peacetime economies,
but not war economies.
To see why Russia has outperformed
so far, it's time for a quick war.
Economics 1 or 1 lesson,
starting with a simple definition.
What is a war economy?
In a nutshell, a war
economy is about doing what is necessary
to support the military effort.
Transitioning from a civilian to a war
economy is therefore about changing
the nation's focus, from what's best
for the people to what's best for the war.
Of course,
war equals destruction and death.
That is not good for the economy.
In the long run.
However, in the short run, which actually
can be quite a few years, it's
actually very normal for war economies
to see their GDP increase by quite a lot.
For example, just before World
War two, Britain and especially Nazi
Germany got major boosts
from rapid rearmament while the US economy
really started outperforming them all
when it got serious about the war as well.
Even more strikingly,
in the first phase of a war economy,
regular civilians often even get richer.
This can explain why,
after Russia invaded Ukraine, average life
satisfaction in Russia
actually rose to an all time high.
Yes, that's right, as Russia was hit
by unprecedented sanctions
and hundreds of thousands of Russians
were killed or fled the country.
Its economy was booming and regular
Russians were actually becoming
better off.
On average,
this contradiction only makes sense
if we look at it through the lens of war.
Economics 101, and how it can explain
why war boosted Russia's economy
initially.
To fully understand this story, I think
it's essential to look at Russia's war
economy through the lens
of mobilizing local resources for war,
which is then constrained
by international limitations.
To start, it's important
to realize that before the war,
a significant portion of Russian workers
were not working and a significant share
of Russian factories was not operational.
In other words, Russia's
economy was operating below its potential
in times of war.
This is not acceptable.
Therefore, the first phase of the war
economy is about activating unused
resources.
Russia did this by massively
increasing state spending, by drawing down
its wealth and essentially releasing
new money into the economy.
New money into the economy.
Won't that cause inflation?
Not always.
In fact, basic monetary
theory teaches us that if new money helps
to create new products, this new money
does not have to cause inflation.
New money spent on unemployed workers
that are now working in factories
that were previously idle means that
there is now more money in the economy,
but also increased production
in Russia in 2022.
We saw exactly these three things
a massive increase
in spending by the Russian government,
a massive reduction
in unemployment and a higher average
level of industrial output.
This is exactly the same pattern
that we saw when major economies
like the UK, Germany
and the US got ready for war in the 1930s.
But hold on a minute.
Isn't this strange?
Why do countries only activate
these unused resources in times of war?
Can't they do this in times of peace?
To answer this question,
we have to look at Russia's
pre-war economy
through the lens of one of the most famous
theories in international finance
the monetary trilemma.
In the early 2000,
Russia was still trying to be a rapidly
growing modern capitalist economy
and therefore strive
to have an optimally activated economy
and give its citizens
the liberty to attract foreign investments
and to invest abroad.
The monetary trilemma teaches us
that therefore
Russia could not have a stable currency,
a flexible currency
meant that the value of the Russian ruble
was primarily determined
by market forces, by supply and demand.
To see how this works.
Economists often use
the balance of payments framework.
It shows us that demand for the ruble
can increase in two ways.
The first is by increasing exports.
Russian exporters may ask to be paid
in rubles, meaning that European importers
have to sell euros to buy rubles first,
or they may ask to be paid in euros.
In that case, Russian exporters
will likely sell these euros for rubles
soon because most of their costs are,
of course, in rubles.
As a consequence, the ruble becomes worth
more compared to the euro.
If there are more Russian exports.
Similarly, if Europeans
were to invest more in Russia,
they will need rubles to do so,
raising its price.
On the other hand, if Russians import
from Europe or invest in Europe,
they will likely sell some rubles to do
this, driving the price of the ruble down.
This situation changed
drastically in 2013, when Putin promoted
his economic adviser, Elvira Nabu Lena,
as a central bank governor.
When the year previously,
the US had just decimated
the value of Iran's riyal
by sanctioning foreign investments,
which in turn encouraged
a run on the Iranian riyal.
Under neighborliness leadership,
Russia adopted this so-called Fortress
Russia strategy
to prevent this scenario at all cost.
Thus, she essentially strived
to make the ruble more stable,
moving Russia's economy from here to here.
On the monetary trilemma,
the value of the Russian ruble
was now no longer
fully determined by the free market.
Instead, neighborliness
Bank of Russia started intervening
by buying any excess foreign currencies
from either investments or exports.
By doing so,
she accumulated Putin's famous war chest,
which could then, in theory,
be used to defend the value of the ruble.
If Russia was ever hit
by Western sanctions,
however, this strategy could only work
if Russia consistently
brought in more foreign currency
than they spent.
It's extremely difficult for a government,
however, to massively
increase exports
or incoming foreign investments.
So if Nabi Polina wanted to build her war
chest
and keep the exchange rates somewhat
stable and keep money flowing freely
in and out of Russia,
she had only one real option.
Reducing how much? Russians imports.
This is easier said than done,
of course, in a relatively free economy.
Imports are not directly controlled
by the state.
They are done by Russian companies
and workers.
However, crucially,
they can only really import a lot
if they have enough money to do so.
Using this knowledge, Polina and Putin
essentially reduced imports
by making Russians a little bit poorer
than they had to be by severely
limiting government spending and keeping
interest rates relatively high.
Of course,
we know with the benefit of hindsight,
that Fortress Russia was a massive failure
in the modern world.
Foreign currencies held by a central bank
are not bars of gold in a vault
anymore, but rather financial assets
issued by other countries
like the US Treasury bonds
or deposit in European banks.
In other words, when Russia said
we have 300 billion in reserves,
much of that was actually in accounts
outside of Russia,
under Western jurisdiction.
Maybe Yelena had gambled that Western
and especially European countries
did not have the guts
to freeze their assets.
She was wrong.
Once Russia's war chest was frozen,
capital started fleeing Russia, quickly
collapsing the ruble.
Yet it was at this moment that Nabih Olena
showed her pragmatism
and skill as an economist.
To save the ruble,
she knew there were only two options.
Either she could reduce imports
by making Russians
even poorer,
by making the government spend even less.
However, given that this conflict
needed more and more government
spending on the war,
her only option left was essentially
to introduce capital controls
moving the Russian economy
from here to here.
On the trilemma.
Now, the fact that she now directly
controls money flowing out of Russia
enabled the Russian government
to fully activate the Russian economy
without collapsing the ruble.
After all, while Russians
now had the purchasing power to import
to their heart's content,
they simply were not allowed to do so.
This move surprised
many economic analysis, because they were
no longer used to thinking
about capital controls as a viable option.
It is, however, the first crucial step
to see
why Russia's economy will not collapse
if we study historical economic collapses.
We can essentially see four ways
economies collapse.
The most frequent one is sudden
capital flight.
This may happen
because a financial bubble pops,
like what happens during the 1997 Asian
financial crisis or 2011 eurozone crisis.
It may also happen because the country
has been importing too much for too long.
Like the Lebanese crisis of 2019
or Sri Lanka's 2022 currency collapse.
Or it may happen because of sanctions
such as the 2012
Iran crisis or 2020
22 collapse of the ruble.
Regardless of what the cost may be,
though, Russia has essentially ruled out
this type of economic collapse
when it introduced capital controls.
This means that, internationally speaking,
Russia is now
really only vulnerable
to an economic collapse.
If crucial imports get squeezed suddenly,
for example, through a blockade.
Arguably, this is what happened
to Imperial Germany in 1918,
where the Allied blockade at least
contributed to severe food shortages,
which then arguably led Germans
to revolt and overthrow the Kaiser.
Given that Russia has so many
natural resources, produces
all the food that it needs,
and has a pretty reliable trading partner
in China and also in India, its economy
does not seem particularly vulnerable
to a collapse in crucial imports
or exports right now.
This leaves us with option three, an
internal collapse due to excessive debt.
Japan 1992.
The US in 2007.
In these crises, local households
were increasingly borrowing against
ever rising housing prices.
When that stopped, the bubble
collapsed, the banks collapsed,
and the economy collapsed with it.
Another super interesting example
is the collapse of Russia's predecessor,
the Soviet Union, which famously collapsed
after years of economic
and political dysfunction,
after which the government saw no other
way out than to start printing money
in order to keep paying all of its various
powerful interest groups
that supported the government.
If we look at Russia's economy today,
we can see that while there are some signs
of a housing price bubble and excessive
government spending running down reserves,
both household debt and government debt
in Russia are still exceptionally low,
making such a collapse extremely unlikely,
at least in the short run.
Finally,
there are some examples, yes, of crises
where all of the previous factors
played a role,
but where the economic pain
was just unexpectedly too much
for an already disgruntled population
to take,
making them demand change
through protesting,
for example, that in the Vietnam era in
the US was not out of control
and the US had plenty of resources
increasing loss of life
and inflation still turned public opinion
against the war.
Similarly,
while the Soviet Union arguably collapsed
due to increased government
spending and debt, this all happened
very, very quickly, much more quickly
than people expected, potentially
due to the public being unhappy
about its decades of economic stagnation.
This could, of course,
theoretically happen to Russia as well.
In fact,
there are some cracks beginning to show
inflation is still dangerously high.
Economic growth has come down quite a bit,
so the easy phase one of Russia's war
economy is now clearly over.
Russians are now going to be feeling
more and more economic pain.
This could yes, it could still
turn Russians against the war.
Right?
Yeah it could.
However,
this is very unlikely to happen quickly
because Russia's war
economy is just getting started.
Now, the core of this argument
is that, yes, an ever increasing
economy is ultimately unsustainable,
but Russia's war
economy is still quite far
from that point for three reasons.
First, if we compare war spending to GDP
between Russia and other famous
historical war economies,
we can clearly see that actually Russia's
war spending compared to the size of its
economy, is actually even lower
than that of the US during Vietnam,
and it's way lower than the Soviet Union.
War spending in the 1980s
had way, way lower
than that of the Nazis
during the height of the Second World War.
So, given that Russia's economy
is already at its maximum capacity,
how were these other war economies
then able to spend so much more?
Well, this gets us to my second argument.
When it comes to the main economic tools
to control
our economy,
Russia has only really introduced one.
Yet the capital controls
that we've been talking about.
As you have seen, capital controls
are extremely effective
at preventing balance of payments crises,
but they come at a cost of reduced freedom
for citizens.
Historical war economies
like the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany
employed similar freedom
reducing tools to control inflation.
Specifically, they introduced price
controls and wage controls to keep prices
from rising too quickly, while military
spending got bigger and bigger and bigger.
This brings us to phase
two of the war economy.
If phase one, everyone is happy,
we've seen that.
But in phase two,
real sacrifices have to be made.
Specifically, civilian industries
will have to be sacrificed more and more
to free up resources
for the ever expanding war economy.
Not have enough workers to produce drones?
Do you really need movie theaters?
Do you really need coffee shops?
Not enough fuel available for tanks.
Do you really need people
to go on vacation?
You catch my drift?
Historical economies
like the Soviet Union and Germany
sacrifice
civilian freedom for military might.
Russia is only at the start
of this process.
But yes, there are some signs
that it is starting to go down this path.
Now, Lana has already shown us
she's pragmatic and willing
to think outside the box
when she introduce capital controls.
Wage controls have not yet
been introduced in Russia, but
there are now credible reports
that the Russian government is considering
introducing sweeping
price controls for essentials like food.
But won't this turn Russian public opinion
against the war?
Yes, of course.
This brings me to my third
and final argument.
Russian
public opinion is still at an all time
high and as was shown to us
when the war just started.
Russia's authoritarian government
can afford to let public opinion
sink quite a bit further.
So these three arguments are why
I think waiting
for a Russian economic
collapse is a naive fantasy.
Sure, as you've seen with the Vietnam
era USA or with the Soviet Union,
some economies that still look
pretty fine on paper can collapse.
So I could be wrong,
but if we look at all the main ways
that economic collapse has happened
by facing a run on their currency
being blocked from crucial resources,
having too much debt
or very low public morale, Russia's
economy actually looks really stable.
This does not mean that Russia's
economy cannot be hurt.
Crucially, sanctioning
Russia may directly hurt its war effort
by reducing its ability
to pay for crucial water imports.
It also does not mean that
Russia does not have serious problems.
For example, there are manpower shortages
as well as some serious gas shortages
right now in Russia. Don't you?
Ukrainian attacks.
However, given
just how few really oppressive war economy
tools Russia has used to this day,
and given how flexible
Putin's
central banker has shown herself to be,
I think it's in the interest of everyone
to recognize that simply
waiting is not enough
to stop the Russian war machine.
In fact, I think this analysis shows us
that if the West wants to keep Ukraine
free, it seriously needs to ramp up
economic support.
But yeah, that's my take.
