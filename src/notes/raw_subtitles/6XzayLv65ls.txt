[Music]


so
 hi
 everyone
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 Good


Company
 I'm
 Nicola
 tangan
 and
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 someone
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 we
 are
 joined
 by
 Patrick
 Doyle
 and


Josh
 kobza
 the
 executive
 chair
 and
 the


CEO
 of
 restaurant
 Brands
 so
 basically


you
 get
 two
 for
 the
 priz
 or
 one
 like
 in


a
 good
 fast
 food
 retail
 shop
 they
 own


Burger
 King
 team
 Hortons
 firehouse
 and


Popeye
 so
 basically
 combined
 they
 sell


billions
 of
 burgers
 coffees
 chicken


sandwiches
 so
 hey
 what's
 so
 good
 about


the
 fast
 food
 industry
 we
 think
 it's
 a


great
 industry
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 very


stable
 industry
 people
 generally
 eat


three
 times
 a
 day
 365
 days
 a
 year
 uh
 so


it's
 pretty
 consistent
 business
 to
 be
 in


and
 there
 are
 a
 bunch
 of
 of
 really


incredible
 Global
 growth
 drivers
 you


have
 the
 formalization
 of
 the
 restaurant


sector
 all
 around
 the
 world
 especially


in
 developing
 markets
 that's
 a
 decades


long
 uh
 journey
 and
 that
 drives
 a
 lot
 of


structural
 growth
 for
 us
 it's
 also
 a


pretty
 good
 margin
 business
 so
 our


margin
 profile
 is
 something
 like
 40%


operating
 margins
 and
 it's
 pretty
 low


Capital
 intensity
 so
 something
 like
 10%


of
 IAA
 goes
 into
 capex
 cheap
 to
 make
 the


shops
 and
 uh
 high
 margin
 yeah
 overall


sounds
 sounds
 like
 a
 good
 combination


now
 you're
 in
 coffee
 you're
 in
 Burgers


chicken
 sandwiches
 why
 are
 those


particularly
 good
 sectors
 they're
 the


four
 biggest
 ones
 uh
 globally
 so
 we're


already
 we
 have
 amazing
 brands
 in
 the


four
 largest
 segments
 of
 Quick
 Service


restaurants
 globally
 pretty
 good
 place


to
 be
 well
 there's
 one
 one
 thing
 here


which
 is
 glaringly
 absent
 in
 my
 mind


which
 is
 pizza
 terrible


category
 now
 uh
 Patrick
 you
 previously


the
 CEO
 of
 Domino's
 Pizza
 so
 why
 have


you
 not
 entered
 the
 pizza
 business
 with


this
 company
 we've
 got
 plenty
 to
 work
 on


with
 the
 with
 four
 categories
 we're
 in


today
 Russell's
 doing
 a
 terrific
 job
 at


Domino's
 and
 there
 is
 just
 enormous


value
 that
 we
 can
 create
 through
 these


four
 categories
 and
 four
 Brands
 around


the
 world
 today
 so
 we
 need
 to
 prove
 that


this
 is
 uh
 a
 business
 that
 makes
 sense


having
 this
 holding
 company
 having
 these


four
 Brands
 together
 that
 we
 can
 run


them
 better
 than
 if
 they
 were


uh
 independent
 and
 separate
 and
 we
 can


we
 can
 prove
 that
 with
 four
 categories


we
 don't
 need
 to
 prove
 it
 with
 five
 but


when
 you
 compare
 if
 you
 and
 now
 contrast


and
 compare
 Pizza
 against
 burgers
 for


instance
 what
 how
 do
 how
 does
 it
 stack


up
 what's
 the
 best
 business
 well
 I
 you


know
 look
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 it's
 a
 a


question
 of
 a
 best
 business
 is
 a


franchise
 or
 because
 mostly
 your
 income


is
 coming
 from
 uh
 from
 collecting


royalties
 from
 the


franchisees
 as
 a
 as
 an
 investor
 in
 the


public
 company
 and
 the
 franchise
 or


they're
 both
 terrific
 businesses
 But


ultimately
 the
 health
 of
 the
 business


comes
 down
 to
 the
 cash
 on
 cash
 returns


for
 the
 franchisees
 so
 you
 know
 the


answer
 on
 what
 is
 the
 best
 business
 it's


the
 it's
 the
 business
 that
 gives
 the


best
 returns
 to
 the
 franchisees
 if


they're
 getting
 a
 great
 return
 on
 their


investment
 they're
 going
 to
 build
 more


they're
 going
 to
 reinvest
 uh
 in
 their


restaurants
 so
 franchisees
 they


basically
 run
 the
 restaurants
 for
 you


they
 run
 the
 restaurants
 they
 own
 it


it's
 their
 capital
 and
 it's
 their
 return


if
 they're
 getting
 a
 great
 return
 then


they're
 going
 to
 build
 more
 of
 them
 and


that's
 going
 to
 accelerate
 the
 overall


growth
 of
 the
 brand
 and
 because
 we're


fundamentally
 our
 earning
 stream
 is
 off


the
 top
 line
 as
 a
 royalty
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 sales
 um
 our
 job
 is
 to


create
 a
 great
 economic
 uh
 business
 and


opportunity
 for
 those
 franchisees
 and
 so


as
 a


franchisor
 to
 me
 the
 best
 business
 is


the
 one
 that
 gives
 the
 best
 return
 to


the
 franchisee
 and
 those
 that
 are
 most


focused
 on
 that
 and
 what
 and
 what
 are


you
 seeing
 just
 now
 I
 mean
 you
 have


inflation
 which
 has
 been
 high
 you
 have


some
 economic
 challenges
 in
 many


countries
 what
 does
 the
 consumer
 behave


like
 overall
 the
 business
 is
 doing


pretty
 well
 and
 we're
 seeing
 pretty
 good


Trends
 from
 from
 consumers
 if
 you
 look


at
 our
 our
 results
 last
 year
 and


especially
 uh
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 we


actually
 saw
 a
 bunch
 of
 great
 things
 in


our
 our
 biggest
 business
 in
 Tims
 we
 were


positive
 in
 traffic
 in
 our
 our
 Burger


King
 business
 which
 we've
 been
 working


to
 change
 the
 trajectory
 of
 we're
 also


positive
 in
 traffic
 for
 the
 first
 time


in
 a
 while
 so
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 biggest


business
 we're
 actually
 seeing
 prettyy


good
 Trends
 are
 you
 seeing
 any
 impact
 on


the
 weight
 loss
 strikes
 nothing
 that
 we


can
 see
 yet
 no
 do
 you
 think
 there
 will


be
 I
 think
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 but
 it
 you


know
 we
 really
 haven't
 seen
 anything


that
 that
 we
 can
 pick
 up
 on
 at
 this


point
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 do
 the
 the
 quick


math
 if
 10
 to
 20%
 of
 people
 wind
 up
 on


these
 drugs
 over
 time
 and
 they
 reduce


their
 caloric
 intake
 by
 10
 or


20%
 you're
 talking
 about
 you
 know
 a
 1
 to


4%
 overall
 reduction
 in
 calories


consumed
 by
 people
 and
 look
 these
 drugs


for
 people
 who
 need
 them
 it's
 wonderful


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 fabulous
 thing
 but
 if
 that


happens
 over
 time
 it's
 a
 negligible


effect
 on
 you
 know
 on
 the
 overall


restaurant
 industry
 what
 drives
 the


restaurant
 industry
 ultimately
 is
 the


number
 of
 employed
 people
 people
 who
 are


employed
 value
 the
 convenience
 of
 food


being
 prepared
 for
 them
 meals
 being


prepared
 for
 them
 particularly
 if
 it's
 a


two
 income
 household
 um
 just
 time
 value


is
 high
 and
 so
 the
 convenience
 of


getting
 a
 meal
 prepared
 for
 you
 is
 you


know
 is
 the
 value
 of
 that
 is
 terrific


and
 so
 you
 know
 what
 I
 always
 look
 at
 is


um
 you
 know
 tell
 me
 what
 employment


levels
 look
 like
 in
 markets
 and
 if
 if


overall
 employment
 is
 rising
 it's
 a
 very


good
 sign
 for
 uh
 the
 restaurant
 industry


if
 you
 start
 seeing
 jobs
 getting
 cut
 um


then
 that
 becomes
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a


concern
 okay
 well
 let's
 zoom
 in
 on
 uh
 on


on
 Burger
 King


now
 we
 had
 a
 we
 had
 the
 COO
 of
 the
 OT


Burger
 Company
 on
 the
 uh
 on
 the
 show
 how


do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 compare
 the
 two


companies
 we're
 entirely
 focused
 on
 the


Whopper
 which
 is
 our
 Flagship
 product


it's
 a
 huge
 brand
 and
 of
 itself
 flame


grilling
 which
 is
 our
 big
 functional


differentiator
 uh
 we're
 the
 only
 large


player
 that
 does
 flame
 grilling
 and
 and


it
 generates
 a
 really
 differentiated


taste
 that
 our
 guests
 love
 and
 have
 it


your
 way
 uh
 which
 is
 something
 we


started
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 and
 we're
 uh


we're
 bringing
 it
 back
 in
 even
 more


modern
 iteration
 really
 reaiming
 The


Flame
 or
 something
 that's
 that's
 the
 big


part
 of
 the
 plan
 um
 so
 we've
 been


working
 on
 on
 that
 that
 is
 the
 big


investment
 plan
 that
 we
 put
 together
 we


announced
 about
 $400
 million
 a
 year
 and


a
 half
 or
 so
 ago
 and
 we're
 working
 on
 a


lot
 of
 things
 uh
 including
 modernizing


all
 the
 facilities
 we
 think
 we
 need
 to


have
 uh
 modern
 convenient
 restaurants


everywhere
 in
 America
 and
 we
 fell
 behind


on
 that
 I
 have
 a
 Big
 Mac
 hair
 and
 I
 have


a
 double
 w
 hair
 just
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 compare
 them
 as
 a
 Prof
 professional


not
 the
 waer
 is
 much
 better
 I
 don't
 know


where
 to
 start
 why
 I'm
 a
 little


surprised
 you
 say
 this


but
 if
 you
 you
 like
 scientifically
 what


is
 the
 difference
 there
 scientifically


the
 Whopper
 is
 much
 bigger
 uh
 that


that's
 our
 starting
 point
 uh
 it's
 a


large
 uh
 burger
 and
 you
 get
 more
 uh
 but


the
 other
 big
 differentiator
 is
 what
 I


mentioned
 is
 the
 flame
 grilling
 what


does
 the
 flame
 do
 it
 gives
 it
 like
 more


of
 a
 Char
 boiled
 taste
 uh
 that
 guests
 uh


very
 much
 prefer
 over
 the
 kind
 of
 the


flat
 top
 grilling
 now
 you
 kicked
 it
 off


in
 the
 50s
 right
 yeah
 I
 think
 it
 was


1957
 uh
 was
 the
 birthday
 has
 it
 changed


since
 then
 or
 is
 it
 the
 same
 thing
 it's


evolved
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 not
 too
 it's


pretty
 close
 to
 the
 original
 version


what
 do
 you
 guys
 eat
 Whopper
 any


particular
 no
 it's
 straight
 a
 straight


Whopper
 with
 cheese
 right
 I
 I'm
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 a
 double
 cheeseburger
 guy
 I


have
 been
 since
 I
 I
 I
 was
 growing
 up


that's
 my
 favorite
 is
 it
 a
 good
 as
 it


can
 be
 while
 you
 working
 to
 improve
 it


further
 I
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 place
 that


we
 can
 improve
 the
 Whopper
 is
 delivering


on
 it
 more
 consistently
 uh
 every
 day


every
 time
 it
 is
 America's
 favorite


burger
 but
 we
 haven't
 always
 executed


perfectly
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


that
 Tom
 Curtis
 who
 runs
 the
 the
 Burger


King
 business
 is
 doing
 uh
 to
 serve
 an


even
 better
 Whopper
 every
 time
 we're


doing
 a
 lot
 more
 training
 uh
 to
 make


sure
 we
 deliver
 the
 gold
 standard


specification
 of
 the
 Whopper
 and
 we've


also
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 investments
 in


equipment
 uh
 so
 we
 had
 some
 dated


equipment
 in
 the
 restaurants
 and
 we
 put


in
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 together


with
 the
 franchises
 to
 make
 sure
 that


all
 of
 the
 equipment
 is
 up
 to
 spec
 in


modern
 that
 has
 a
 really
 big
 impact
 on


the
 consistency
 that
 you
 get
 in


everything
 from
 the
 toasting
 of
 the
 Buns


to
 the
 the
 heat
 of
 the
 product
 that


comes
 out
 so
 we
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on


just
 making
 sure
 we're
 delivering
 that


gold
 standard
 Whopper
 every
 time
 every


day
 now
 Patrick
 you
 were
 in
 charge
 of


the
 big
 rehash
 of
 Domino's
 Pizza
 when


you
 basically
 went
 out
 and
 said
 it's


actually
 not
 very
 good
 but
 now
 we
 are


going
 to
 sort
 out
 something
 which
 is


much
 better
 are
 you
 planning
 to
 do
 the


same
 hair
 no
 you
 it's
 it's
 interesting


if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 four
 brands
 that


we
 have
 the
 one
 thing
 and
 at
 some
 level


the
 only
 thing
 that
 they
 have
 in
 common


other
 than
 allbe
 restaurants
 is
 they


have
 the
 best-in-class
 food
 in
 each
 of


their
 categories
 Popeyes
 is
 the
 best


chicken
 in
 the
 chicken
 category
 just


absolutely
 no
 question
 the
 Whopper
 is


the
 best
 product
 in
 the
 burger
 category


you
 go
 through
 all
 of
 them
 Tims
 has


remarkable
 uh
 coffee
 and
 the
 same
 at
 at


Firehouse
 it's
 the
 only
 one
 that's


that's
 hot
 um
 and
 heated
 so
 the
 food
 is


in
 great
 shape
 Domino's
 was
 in
 a
 very


different
 situation
 where
 you
 know
 what


they
 were
 great
 at
 was
 service
 and


delivery
 and
 value
 um
 and
 they
 executed


quite
 consistently
 their
 problem
 was


people
 didn't
 think
 the
 food
 was
 very


good
 so
 very
 different


circumstance
 here
 where
 we've
 got
 some


opportunities
 like
 with
 Burger
 King
 and


and
 frankly
 speeda
 service
 wise
 on
 popey


we've
 got
 to
 execute
 this
 great
 food
 at


a
 higher
 level
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 the


opportunity
 for
 these
 Brands
 is
 going
 to


come
 from
 execution
 um
 service
 levels
 in


the
 restaurants
 making
 sure
 all
 of
 the


restaurants
 look
 great
 um
 some
 of
 the


Burger
 King
 restaurants
 probably
 half
 of


them
 in
 the
 US
 far
 less
 of
 an
 issue


outside
 the
 US
 where
 most
 of
 the
 Burger


Kings
 look
 great
 um
 but
 in
 the
 US
 half


of
 them
 really
 need
 to
 be
 remodeled
 um


so
 it's
 more
 an
 execution
 issue
 here


than
 a
 food
 issue
 do
 you
 have
 a


responsibility
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 people's


Health
 yeah
 I
 think
 we
 do
 need
 to
 be


very
 thoughtful
 uh
 about
 the
 ingredients


that
 go
 into
 our
 food
 how
 we
 prepare
 it


and
 the
 nutrition
 of
 it
 and
 we've
 become


much
 more
 conscious
 of
 those
 ingredients


uh
 over
 time
 Burger
 King
 was
 one
 of
 the


the
 first
 Brands
 actually
 to
 go
 through


all
 of
 its
 ingredients
 and
 take
 out
 all


artificial
 colors
 flavors
 we
 actually
 we


moved
 to
 a
 much
 cleaner
 ingredient
 list


about
 four
 or
 five
 years
 ago
 and
 so
 we


have
 been
 thoughtful
 about
 that
 and


we're
 trying
 to
 also
 be
 much
 more


transparent
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 nutritional


values
 of
 of
 the
 food
 well
 you
 know
 we


um
 we
 live
 up
 in
 in
 in
 all
 way
 lots
 of


fish
 L
 over
 fish
 Burgers
 what's
 on
 your


next
 menu
 plan
 so
 if
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the


Burger
 Kings
 here
 in
 the
 US
 which
 I


highly
 encourage
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 firy
 fish


which
 is
 a
 spicier
 version
 of
 a
 fish


sandwich
 that's
 out
 now
 for
 Lent
 and
 I


don't
 know
 about
 a
 chicken
 burger
 but
 we


actually
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 great
 chicken


products
 already
 we
 have
 our
 original


chicken
 sandwich
 which
 has
 been
 a


favorite
 for
 about
 60
 years
 and
 we
 now


have
 our
 Royal
 Krispy
 uh
 chicken


sandwich
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 chicken


options
 a
 couple
 of
 fish
 options
 uh
 and


encourage
 you
 to
 check
 them
 out


plant-based
 has
 perhaps
 not
 taken
 off


the
 way
 we
 thought
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 it's


interesting
 on
 that
 um
 in
 Europe
 it
 has


so
 you
 know
 you're
 looking
 at
 a
 pretty


high
 mix
 on
 plant-based
 now
 in
 Europe


we've
 got
 markets
 that
 are
 in
 the
 20
 30%


of
 sales
 are
 plant-based
 products
 what


the
 biggest
 plant-based
 countries
 the


further
 north
 you
 get
 in
 Europe
 the
 more


you've
 got
 plant-based
 the
 further
 south


still
 less
 so
 you
 know
 Germany
 um


Scandinavia
 generally
 um
 the
 UK
 you've


got
 higher
 levels
 you
 get
 down
 to
 Italy


France
 somewhat
 lower
 gree
 somewhat


lower
 uh
 I
 think
 Austria
 is
 maybe
 the


highest
 um
 plant-base
 right
 now
 um
 but


it's
 been
 much
 less
 of
 a
 uh
 driver
 of


business
 in
 the
 US
 um
 it's
 a
 low
 single


digit
 percentage
 of
 of
 sales
 in
 the
 US


but
 adoption
 in
 Europe
 has
 actually
 been


very
 strong
 moving
 on
 to
 Tim
 Hortons
 now


I
 think
 perhaps
 if
 you
 not
 from
 Canada


it's
 difficult
 to
 understand
 how
 what


what
 an
 institution
 it
 is
 right
 how
 how


important
 is
 TE
 Hort
 it's
 incredibly


important
 to
 our
 guests
 in
 Canada
 and


it's
 very
 important
 to
 to
 us
 as
 well
 I


think
 it
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 special


and
 and
 most
 unique
 qsr
 grants
 anywhere


in
 the
 world
 um
 it's
 almost
 synonymous


with
 the
 country
 our
 our
 logo
 uh
 has


some
 similarities
 to
 to
 the
 Canadian


flag
 and
 I
 think
 Canadians
 view
 it
 as


theirs
 uh
 rightly
 so
 and
 what's
 good


about
 it
 I
 think
 the
 coffee
 business


overall
 is
 a
 great
 business
 it's
 a
 very


routine
 based
 business
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 our


guests
 come
 to
 us
 every
 single
 day
 of


the
 week
 some
 multiple
 times
 a
 day
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 loyalty
 and
 the


beverage
 business
 is
 a
 good
 business
 a


high
 margin
 uh
 business
 what
 it's
 it's


an
 addiction
 business
 right
 it's
 a


recurring
 I
 me
 this
 this
 is
 my
 number


four
 today
 great
 that's
 perfect
 legal


drug
 right
 you
 stop
 drinking
 coffee
 you


get
 like
 headache
 three
 days
 I
 mean


several
 days
 headache
 yeah
 I
 I
 have
 it


every
 morning
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 do
 three


or
 four
 a
 day
 but
 uh
 but
 every
 morning


pretty
 much
 but
 it's
 an
 amazing
 business


the
 product
 is
 terrific
 people
 love
 it


and
 truly
 I
 mean
 I've
 spent
 you
 know


half
 of
 my
 career
 outside
 of
 the
 US


there
 is
 no
 brand
 um
 in
 its
 Home
 Market


that
 is
 as
 beloved
 as
 Tim's
 is
 in
 Canada


so
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 then
 so


it's
 kind
 of
 maxed
 out
 in
 terms
 of
 Love


penetration
 shopping
 patterns
 all
 that


kind
 of
 stuff
 where
 do
 you
 take
 it
 from


there
 love
 yes
 penetration
 no
 there's


still
 there
 are
 still
 more
 opportunities


business
 in
 the
 afternoon
 and
 evenings


is
 growing
 very
 fast
 we're
 moving
 more


and
 more
 to
 cold
 beverage
 which
 is
 a


great
 driver
 of
 business
 and
 then
 we've


got
 the
 opportunity
 to
 take
 it
 around


the
 world
 and
 we're
 doing
 that
 now
 um
 so


it's
 now
 growing
 outside
 of
 Canada


including
 into
 the
 US
 um
 and
 that's


really
 what's
 going
 to
 drive
 growth
 on


it
 but
 there's
 still
 even
 opportunities


in
 Canada
 Canada
 is
 one
 of
 the
 faster


growing
 populations
 um
 amongst
 developed


countries
 in
 the
 world
 just
 because
 of


the
 immigration
 policies
 it's
 growing


probably
 a
 percent
 and
 a
 half
 a
 year
 so


we
 should
 be
 growing
 our
 you
 know


restaurant
 counts
 at
 least
 a
 percent
 and


a
 half
 uh
 a
 year
 in
 Canada
 so
 there


there
 are
 actually
 a
 lot
 of
 growth


opportunities
 there
 but
 it's
 our
 biggest


business
 from
 a
 cash
 flow
 standpoint
 for


RBI
 um
 it's
 bigger
 than
 Burger
 King
 it's


the
 more
 you
 can
 do
 on
 the
 global
 coffee


scene
 oh
 Absol
 absolutely
 you
 know
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 we
 got
 involved
 with
 the


business
 is
 we
 think
 that
 the
 global


coffee
 bussiness
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


compelling
 opportunities
 out
 there
 and


will
 be
 for
 decades
 to
 come
 and
 than
 to


your
 point
 many
 of
 the
 best
 restaurant


companies
 they
 have
 a
 geographic
 origin


story
 Popeyes
 has
 the
 same
 it
 brings
 a


lot
 of
 its
 Authority
 from
 coming
 from


New
 Orleans
 and
 the
 Cajun
 cooking
 and
 so


the
 fact
 that
 Tim
 Horton
 is
 closely
 tied


with
 its
 origin
 I
 think
 is
 a
 good
 thing


uh
 there's
 some
 there's
 a
 strong
 point


of
 view
 there
 and
 the
 business
 has
 a
 lot


of
 authority
 in
 coffee
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 a


natural
 uh
 player
 in
 in
 the
 global


coffee
 markets
 and
 there's
 so
 many


exciting
 markets
 out
 there
 you
 know


there's
 places
 like
 China
 where
 you're


just
 starting
 to
 see
 um
 greater
 adoption


of
 coffee
 India
 is
 another
 one
 I
 think


those
 are
 two
 that
 that
 have
 us
 the
 most


excited
 as
 come
 visit
 the
 the
 coffee


beans
 that
 are
 being
 grown
 in
 Canada


they're
 pretty


remarkable
 sorry
 you
 doesn't


exist
 I
 had
 never
 heard
 about
 it
 so
 it


wasn't
 new
 one
 for
 me
 very
 Southern


Canada
 yeah
 you
 go
 you
 do
 grow
 wine
 now


in
 Canada
 exactly
 but
 there
 are
 some


problems
 related
 to
 Coffee
 production
 uh


in
 particular
 in
 in
 deforestation
 and


child
 labor
 how
 are
 you
 dealing
 with


these
 we're
 very
 thoughtful
 about
 the


sustainability
 of
 our
 coffee
 we
 go
 back


and
 and
 verify
 the
 sustainability
 of
 it


and
 look
 at
 things
 like
 farming


practices
 and
 in
 all
 the
 places
 that
 we


buy
 from
 so
 we're
 auditing
 for
 you
 know


child
 labor
 and
 I
 mean
 we're
 doing


everything
 we
 possibly
 can
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you
 know
 we
 are
 as
 good
 at
 that
 as


anybody
 moving
 on
 to
 um
 corpor
 culture


do
 these
 brands
 have
 separate
 corpor


cultures
 and
 in
 which
 case
 what
 what
 are


they
 like
 we
 have
 a
 unified
 corporate


culture
 across
 all
 of
 the
 businesses
 I


think
 culture
 comes
 from
 the
 leaders
 and


like
 and
 what
 they
 exemplify
 for
 me
 it's


less
 about
 the
 the
 value
 statements
 the


management
 systems
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 it


comes
 from
 what
 we
 do
 and
 and
 that's


what
 I've
 seen
 over
 all
 of
 my
 years
 in


business
 I
 find
 that
 if
 we
 wear
 suits


and
 ties
 you
 end
 up
 seeing
 it
 in
 the


restaurants
 if
 we
 wear
 jeans
 and


t-shirts
 you'll
 find
 that
 too
 and
 uh
 if


we're
 kind
 with
 people
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


you'll
 find
 out
 over
 time
 that
 people
 at


the
 restaurants
 are
 kinder
 to
 the


customers
 are
 you
 kind
 with
 people
 I
 try


to
 be
 try
 he
 is
 I
 promise
 so
 I
 I
 I
 am


just
 very
 conscious
 of
 the
 behaviors


that
 we
 model
 as
 leaders
 and
 I
 think


that
 tends
 to
 find
 its
 way
 through
 your


organization
 in
 a
 faster
 way
 than
 than


you
 think
 in
 a
 more
 powerful
 way
 than


systems
 uh
 can
 can
 drive
 you
 uh
 employ
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 young
 people
 how
 many


people
 do
 you
 employ
 so
 if
 you
 look


across
 our
 system
 including
 all
 the


franchises
 the
 total
 employee
 uh
 count


is
 probably
 somewhere
 north
 of
 500,000


today
 so
 he's
 a
 tenth
 of
 the
 Norwegian


population
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 how
 to


treat
 these
 young
 people
 in
 many
 cases


you
 would
 be
 the
 first
 meeting
 with
 a


job
 right
 yeah
 huge
 responsibility
 it's


a
 really
 important
 one
 and
 and
 many
 of


us
 had
 some
 of
 our
 first
 jobs
 in


restaurants
 I
 don't
 know
 about
 you
 guys


I
 had
 I
 had
 my
 first
 job
 in
 a
 uh
 a
 fried


fish
 restaurant
 in
 in
 Florida
 so
 many


people
 have
 their
 formative
 experience


there
 and
 I
 think
 uh
 young
 people
 they


want
 to
 be
 proud
 of
 what
 they're
 selling


uh
 they
 want
 to
 have
 flexibility
 uh


because
 they're
 probably
 probably
 trying


to
 work
 around
 other
 things
 in
 their


lives
 uh
 whether
 that's
 school
 or
 or


another
 job
 or
 or
 family
 commitments
 I


think
 we
 provide
 both
 those
 things
 and
 I


think
 the
 really
 important
 thing
 in
 my


mind
 uh
 is
 the
 environment
 that
 we
 give


people
 to
 work
 in
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the


less
 discussed
 things
 about
 our
 efforts


to
 to
 update
 all
 of
 the
 the
 bur
 King
 us


facilities
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 critical


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 an
 employer
 today
 a


competitive
 employer
 to
 give
 people
 a


workplace
 that
 they're
 comfortable
 in


and
 they're
 proud
 of
 how
 do
 you
 make


people
 proud
 of
 working
 in
 a
 Burger
 King


I
 want
 them
 to
 have
 pride
 in
 the


products
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 products


that
 they're
 serving
 I
 want
 them
 to
 feel


proud
 of
 the
 facility
 where
 they
 work
 at


uh
 where
 that's
 a
 a
 NIC
 looking
 facility


that
 people
 uh
 feel
 good
 about
 and
 I


think
 the
 other
 important
 thing
 is
 like


the
 kindness
 and
 the
 relationship
 with


the
 people
 who
 are
 running
 the


restaurants
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 comes
 from


the
 restaurant
 general
 manager
 you
 you


always
 find
 when
 you
 walk
 into
 a


restaurant
 and
 you
 have
 an
 amazing


restaurant
 general
 manager
 the


restaurant
 just
 magically
 works
 better


you
 can
 tell
 people
 are
 happy
 uh
 the


environment
 and
 the
 kitchen's
 better
 the


interactions
 with
 the
 customers
 are


different
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 example


that
 the
 restaurant
 general
 manager
 set


for
 young
 employees
 is
 really
 powerful


and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 comes
 from
 our


franchisees
 so
 how
 do
 you
 find
 these


people
 how
 do
 you
 interview
 for
 that


type
 of
 soft
 skills
 I
 think
 that's
 one


of
 the
 discussions
 that
 we've
 had
 a
 lot


uh
 recently
 is
 what's
 the
 right
 profile


of
 franchisee
 and
 I
 I
 feel
 very
 strongly


that
 the
 smaller
 franchisees
 who
 are
 who


are
 involved
 in
 their
 communities
 uh
 who


are
 in
 the
 restaurants
 every
 day
 they're


the
 ones
 who
 tend
 to
 be
 the
 most


successful
 because
 they
 care
 a
 lot
 about


their
 people
 and
 and
 people
 feel
 that


and
 I
 think
 that's
 probably
 the
 most


profound
 thing
 that
 impacts
 the


environment
 in
 a
 restaurant
 but
 I'll


tell
 you
 n
 the
 to
 me
 in
 the
 restaurants


the
 answer
 is
 always
 and
 frankly
 even
 in


corporate
 level
 um
 you
 hire
 attitude
 you


teach


skills
 and
 so
 if
 somebody
 comes
 in
 and


they
 want
 to
 work
 in
 your
 restaurant
 and


they
 walk
 in
 and
 they
 look
 presentable


they
 show
 up
 on
 time
 for
 the
 interview


they're
 looking
 you
 in
 the
 eye
 when


they're
 speaking
 to
 you
 and
 they're


shaking
 your
 hand
 and
 they're
 saying


thank
 you
 for
 this


opportunity
 perfect
 you're
 done
 I'm


going
 to
 hire
 that
 person
 and
 you
 know
 a


mistake
 that
 I've
 seen
 franchisees
 make


particularly
 when
 they're
 hiring


managers
 restaurant
 managers
 um
 is


they'll
 look
 at
 the
 experience
 of
 that


restaurant
 manager
 and
 the
 number
 of


years
 they've
 been
 doing
 it
 and
 they
 get


very
 focused
 on
 that
 and
 if
 that
 is
 not


a
 kind
 person
 who
 is
 going
 to
 treat
 the


people
 well
 who
 work
 in
 that
 restaurant


I
 don't
 care
 what
 level
 of
 success


they've
 had
 running
 restaurants
 before


um
 I
 want
 the
 person
 who's
 going
 to
 come


in
 and
 set
 a
 tone
 for
 that
 restaurant


and
 for
 all
 of
 the
 young
 people
 who
 are


working
 for
 them
 because
 for
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 the
 people
 working
 in
 the


restaurant
 it
 is
 their
 first
 job
 they're


going
 to
 remember
 that
 experience
 most


of
 them
 are
 going
 to
 wind
 up
 getting


promoted
 at
 some
 point
 to
 customer


they're
 going
 to
 go
 on
 and
 they're
 going


to
 do
 something
 else
 and
 their
 brand


impression
 is
 going
 to
 be
 100%
 built
 by


The
 Experience
 they
 had
 when
 they
 worked


in
 a
 Burger
 King
 or
 a
 popey
 or
 a
 Tim


Hortons
 or
 a
 firehouse
 I
 I
 think
 it's


interesting
 you
 know
 we
 live
 in
 a
 world


where
 there's
 more
 Ai
 and
 more
 machines


more
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 but
 what


strike
 me
 more
 and
 more
 you
 get
 into
 a


restaurant
 what
 makes
 you
 come
 back
 is


just
 the
 the
 I
 mean
 it's
 the
 attention


it's
 the
 absolutely
 it's
 the
 person


seeing
 you
 it's
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 that


connectivity
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 that


the
 people
 who
 work
 there
 have
 that


every
 day
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 like


Relentless
 right
 do
 you
 can't
 you
 can't


skip
 you
 can't
 skip
 a
 day
 that's
 the


franchise


right
 I
 mean
 it's
 ultimately
 the
 tone


that
 the
 franchis
 because
 we
 as
 you
 know


with
 over
 half
 a
 million
 people
 working


in
 our
 restaurants
 around
 the
 world
 we


can't
 be
 enforcing
 that
 it's
 got
 to
 be


something
 that
 is
 naturally
 set
 um
 by


the
 franchisee
 that
 we
 have
 an


expectation
 the
 people
 we
 hire
 are
 going


to
 be
 kind
 to
 our


customers
 and
 that's
 something
 you
 can't


instill
 in
 somebody
 if
 they
 walk
 in
 you


know
 I
 always
 tell
 people
 that
 the


interview
 you
 have
 with
 that
 person
 is


the
 best
 they're
 ever
 going
 to
 be


so
 if
 they
 are
 not
 kind
 to
 you
 when
 they


walk
 in
 if
 they're
 not
 polite
 to
 the


people
 behind
 the
 counter
 when
 they're


asking
 for
 the
 manager
 you
 know
 who's


going
 to
 interview
 them
 I
 mean
 look
 at


all
 of
 those
 signs
 if
 they
 show
 up
 and


they're
 not
 looking
 kind
 of
 neat
 and


smart
 and
 well-groomed
 that's
 the
 best


they're
 ever
 going
 to
 be
 because
 the
 day


they're
 asking
 for
 a
 job
 and
 so
 if
 you


hire
 those
 people
 who
 have
 a
 great


attitude
 and
 it's
 natural
 for
 them


that's
 going
 to
 set
 the
 tone
 for
 every


every
 body
 in
 the
 restaurant
 in
 the


burger
 business
 what's
 the
 people
 turn


over
 there
 for
 instance
 so
 I
 think
 the


key
 is
 the
 restaurant
 general
 manager
 I


think
 that's
 a
 it's
 almost
 like
 it's
 in


any
 business
 right
 what
 keeps
 people
 or


causes
 people
 to
 leave
 is
 usually
 the


manager
 like
 in
 old
 jobs
 I
 mean


supposedly
 you
 quit
 you
 quit
 bosses
 not


companies
 7
 70%
 of
 the
 cases
 you
 equit


the
 boss
 above
 you
 so
 how
 does
 it
 range


so
 you
 got
 a
 good
 shop
 and
 a
 bad
 shop


what's
 the
 difference
 in
 turnover


between
 retention
 huge
 um
 yeah
 it
 varies


a
 little
 bit
 by
 country
 but
 you
 might


have
 up
 to
 200%
 turnover
 in
 the
 team


members
 in
 a
 like
 in
 a
 US
 restaurant
 and


a
 restaurant
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 turnover


and
 in
 a
 better
 one
 you
 could
 be
 sub
 100


you
 keep
 them
 from
 between
 six
 months


and
 one
 year
 on
 average
 i''s
 say
 it's


six
 months
 and
 two
 years
 moving
 on
 to


leadership
 how
 do
 the
 two
 of
 you
 work


together
 really


well
 well
 that's
 the
 way
 it
 looks
 I


think
 you
 you
 you
 are
 I
 mean
 you
 both
 uh


clearly
 very
 young
 and
 so
 on
 but
 you
 are


clearly
 a
 Patrick
 you
 are
 clearly
 a
 bit


less
 young
 how
 old
 are
 you
 I'm
 60
 you're


60
 and
 you
 are
 are
 37
 okay
 but
 on


average
 we're
 very
 averagely
 aged
 for


for
 leaders
 in
 a
 restaurant
 if
 you
 take


the
 average


opportunity
 what
 are
 what
 are
 the
 um


what
 are
 the
 advantages
 of
 having
 uh


somebody
 like
 Patrick
 to
 to
 draw
 on
 and


learn
 from
 there's
 so
 many
 um
 you
 know
 I


just
 think
 in
 anything
 you're
 doing
 I'm


sure
 it's
 the
 case
 for
 you
 and
 your


business
 the
 the
 ability
 to
 talk
 to


somebody
 and
 have
 some
 a
 sounding
 board


somebody
 you
 can
 talk
 through
 some
 of


the
 hardest
 problems
 that
 you
 have
 who's


in
 it
 with
 you
 who
 understands
 the


people
 the
 context
 the
 issues
 who's


lived
 it
 before
 that
 is
 invaluable
 and


so
 what's
 the
 most
 difficult
 thing
 he


has
 helped
 you
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 you


know
 I
 think
 he
 he's
 taught
 me
 lessons


about
 the
 importance
 of
 franchisee
 Prof


profitability
 and
 their
 success
 it's


been
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 that
 we


focused
 on
 over
 the
 last
 year
 and
 it's


been
 really
 profound
 in
 terms
 of


bringing
 everybody
 together
 and
 moving


the
 franchisees
 forward
 uh
 he's
 taught


me
 a
 lot
 about
 about
 being
 a
 better


Communicator
 uh
 it's
 something
 that
 I've


had
 to
 work
 on
 a
 lot
 I've
 learned
 a
 a


lot
 from
 Patrick
 on
 that
 front


and
 I
 think
 the
 ability
 to
 be


relentlessly
 positive
 and
 motivating
 to


people
 while
 still
 dealing
 with
 some
 of


the
 hard
 issues
 what
 has
 he
 taught
 you


about
 communication
 just
 the
 importance


of
 it
 um
 that
 you
 really
 need
 to
 get
 out


there
 this
 is
 a
 you
 know
 to
 the
 point


you
 made
 earlier
 uh
 there
 are
 so
 many


stakeholders
 in
 this
 business
 you
 need


to
 be
 out
 there
 you
 got
 to
 talk
 to


people
 you
 need
 to
 be
 really
 transparent


and
 that's
 something
 that
 we've
 evolved


on
 a
 lot
 um
 over
 the
 past
 year
 and
 a


half
 whether
 it's
 with
 investors
 with


our
 franchisees
 with
 our
 employee
 base


um
 I've
 learned
 to
 become
 much
 more


comfortable
 being
 very
 open
 about
 the


good
 the
 bad
 what
 we're
 working
 on
 uh


and
 I
 think
 that's
 helped
 to
 bring


people
 together
 more
 and
 how
 how
 open


are
 you
 I
 mean
 in
 a
 way
 you
 are
 you
 are


the
 boss
 right
 you
 are
 the
 chair
 right


how
 open
 can
 you
 be
 can
 you
 share
 the


problems
 all
 of
 them
 yeah
 we
 we
 do
 look


Josh's
 the
 CEO
 he
 is
 running
 the


business
 running
 the
 company
 he's
 doing


an
 amazing
 job
 and
 it's
 interesting


because
 you
 get
 into
 this
 role
 and


executive
 chair
 roles
 very
 dramatically


on
 what
 they're
 doing
 in
 in
 the
 company


and
 what
 I've
 come
 to
 realize
 after
 you


know
 we
 work
 through
 together
 and
 you


know
 making
 sure
 we've
 got
 the
 right


team
 in
 place
 we've
 got
 the
 right


strategy
 the
 right
 plan
 for
 executing
 it


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 all
 him
 now
 right
 I


mean
 Josh
 is
 the
 one
 that
 is
 driving
 all


of
 that
 what
 I
 find
 my
 job
 to
 be
 I
 mean


you
 know
 day-to-day
 now
 it's
 mentoring


Josh
 it's
 mentoring
 the
 five
 business


unit
 uh
 presidents
 um
 but
 broadly
 I


think
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 now
 bring
 and


it's
 it's
 because
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 little


longer
 in
 years
 than
 uh
 than
 Josh
 um
 is


speed
 he's
 right


99.5%
 of
 the
 time
 he's
 a
 brilliant


leader
 he
 is
 he
 he
 knows
 the
 right


answer
 it's
 just
 that
 he's
 too
 slow
 and


well
 it's
 not
 that
 he's
 too
 slow
 but
 but


the
 you
 know
 when
 you
 are
 when
 you
 are


earlier
 in
 your
 career
 you're
 still


going
 to
 be
 working
 through
 the


analytics
 on
 these
 things
 and
 saying


okay
 my
 hypothesis
 is
 this
 let's
 test


that
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 analytics
 and


with
 more
 years
 of
 of
 doing
 this
 often
 I


think
 my
 job
 is
 is
 simply
 to
 say
 Josh


you're
 right
 just
 go
 you're
 100%
 right


do
 think
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 the
 Harvard


Education
 which
 is
 slowing
 him


down
 no
 no
 too
 much
 anal
 I
 guarantee
 you


he
 was
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 best


students
 that
 ever
 went
 through
 there


he's
 an
 extraordinarily


bright
 but
 so
 this
 is
 so
 you
 are
 more


you
 are
 more
 analytical
 you
 are
 more


intuitive
 no
 you
 know
 it's
 funny
 because


I'm
 I'm
 originally
 way
 back
 when
 a


finance
 guy
 I'm
 I'm
 pretty
 analytical


it's
 not
 that
 I'm
 more
 intuitive
 at
 this


point
 it's
 just
 that
 more
 experience


I've
 just
 got
 more
 experience
 so
 I've


seen
 it
 before
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 and
 the


answer
 is
 just
 go
 why
 is
 speed
 so


important
 it's
 how
 you
 create


competitive
 advantage
 and
 you
 know
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


the
 most
 important
 things
 that
 you
 look


at
 in
 a
 franchise
 or
 franchisee


relationship
 um
 that
 determines
 the


success
 of
 both
 is
 the
 relationship
 and


the
 level
 of
 trust
 that
 you
 have
 between


the
 franchisees
 and
 the
 franchisor
 if


the
 trust
 level
 is
 high
 you
 move
 twice


as
 fast
 when
 that's
 broken
 it
 just


throws
 sand
 in
 the
 gears
 and
 everything


moves
 slowly
 and
 so
 when
 you're
 trying


to
 change
 and
 adapt
 and
 improve
 the


business
 um
 for
 your
 customers
 for
 your


franchisees


um
 you
 know
 what
 allows
 you
 to
 do
 that


ultimately
 is
 that
 the


franchisees
 look
 at
 you
 and
 say
 look
 he


may
 be
 wrong
 but
 I
 trust
 that
 he
 is


doing
 that
 for
 the
 right
 reasons
 that's


very
 interesting
 because
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 very


uh
 um
 focused
 on
 on
 speed
 but
 I
 haven't


really
 connected
 it
 with
 trust
 yeah
 do


you
 find
 that
 internally
 in
 the
 company


as
 well
 that
 the
 more
 trust
 you
 have
 the


faster
 things
 go
 absolutely
 how
 do
 you


and
 how
 do
 you
 drive
 it
 so
 you
 know
 look


ultimately
 it's
 it's
 about
 communic


it's
 about
 doing
 what
 you
 say
 you're


going
 to
 do
 um
 it's
 about
 being
 very


honest
 about
 what
 the
 real
 issues
 are


and
 taking
 them
 on
 I
 have
 this
 strong


belief
 that
 you
 can
 walk
 into
 any


company
 um
 even
 a
 business
 that
 you


don't
 know
 and
 you
 could
 just
 grab
 10


people
 and
 say
 if
 there
 is
 one
 thing


that
 we
 could
 be
 better
 at
 in
 this


company
 what
 is
 it
 and
 80
 or
 90%
 of
 the


people
 are
 going
 to
 wind
 up
 giving
 you


some
 variation
 of
 the
 same
 answer
 and
 so


then
 the
 question
 is
 well
 then
 why


aren't
 you
 doing
 that
 and
 there's


usually
 the
 answer
 is
 some
 version
 of


how
 hard
 it
 is
 or
 how
 expensive
 it's


going
 to
 be
 or
 you
 know
 just
 how
 high


that
 Hill
 is
 that
 you
 need
 to
 take
 and


you
 know
 so
 I'll
 go
 back
 to
 the
 Domino's


example
 they
 you
 know
 the
 answer
 at


Domino's
 was
 people
 didn't
 think
 our


food
 was
 very
 good
 it's
 like
 okay
 that's


a
 problem
 in
 a
 food


business
 let's
 fix
 it
 let's
 change
 that


and
 so
 you
 know
 working
 with
 Dave


Brandon
 then
 at
 the
 time
 who
 was
 CEO
 and


we
 started
 the
 work
 Russell
 was
 the


chief
 marketing
 officer
 at
 the
 time
 who


there
 was
 it
 actually
 you
 know
 to
 fix


the
 food
 um
 everybody
 knew
 it
 had
 to
 be


done
 Dave
 was
 the
 CEO
 at
 the
 time
 so
 you


know
 Dave
 was
 ultimately
 the
 person
 that


said
 we
 need
 to
 do
 this
 I
 was
 the


president
 of
 the
 US
 business
 so
 I
 wound


up
 driving
 that
 I
 hired
 Russell
 and
 the


process
 of
 fixing
 the
 food
 was
 underway


when
 he
 arrived
 as
 CMO
 but
 he's
 the
 one


who
 oversaw
 the
 the
 advertising
 that


walked
 out
 and
 just
 said
 yeah
 our
 food's


not
 very
 good
 if
 he
 had
 worked
 who
 would


have
 been
 sacked
 me
 okay


that's
 me
 no
 question
 Cool
 Patrick


you've
 been
 um
 you've
 been
 uh
 you
 know


climbing
 a
 few
 Hills
 and
 uh
 what
 makes


you
 continue
 to
 climb
 what
 is
 it
 that


drives
 you
 these
 F
 I
 think
 joy
 in
 this


world
 comes
 from
 doing
 things
 that


you're
 good
 at
 and
 I
 missed
 it
 when
 I


left
 you
 know
 I
 left
 Domino's
 in
 2018


and
 you
 know
 we
 had
 great
 leadership
 it


was
 time
 for
 me
 to
 pass
 the
 Baton
 on
 to


the
 to
 the
 next
 team
 and
 but
 what
 is
 it


what
 is
 it
 particularly
 which
 is
 fun
 you


know
 it's
 fun
 figuring
 things
 out
 seeing


success
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 What's


um
 most
 gratifying
 for
 me
 is
 to
 see
 the


success
 um
 that
 other
 people
 are
 having


because
 you're
 helping
 them
 to
 lead
 the


business
 well
 and
 you
 know
 at
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 for
 me
 really


um
 what
 drives
 me
 is
 the
 success
 of
 the


franchisees
 if
 the
 franchisees
 I
 mean


you
 know
 I
 I
 mean
 most
 of
 my
 closest


friends
 from
 my
 Domino's
 years
 I'm
 very


close
 to
 Russell
 I'm
 very
 close
 to
 Dave


they're
 they
 both
 remain
 very
 very
 good


friends
 um
 but
 most
 of
 my
 closest


friends
 from
 my
 Domino's
 years
 are


franchisees
 that
 what
 you
 eat
 when
 you


hang
 out
 together
 as


well
 no
 I
 make
 from
 the
 Domino's
 years


now
 they've
 got
 to
 eat
 Burger
 King
 and


popey
 Jo
 what
 is
 your
 driver
 what
 who
 do


you
 want
 to
 show
 it's
 evolved
 over
 time


you
 know
 when
 I
 was
 younger
 I
 think
 it


was
 what
 motivates
 a
 lot
 of
 young
 people


you
 want
 to
 be
 successful
 and
 and
 see


progress
 and
 it's
 changed
 a
 bit
 and


today
 I
 think
 it's
 much
 more
 I
 would


like
 to
 be
 proud
 over
 time
 of
 what
 we've


done
 with
 these
 Brands
 uh
 I'd
 like
 to


change
 how
 consumers
 view
 them
 in
 a
 more


positive
 way
 as
 Patrick
 said
 I
 want
 to


see
 your
 franchisees
 be
 successful
 uh


they're
 an
 incredibly
 important
 part
 of


what
 we
 do
 and
 I
 want
 to
 see
 they're


entrepreneurs
 all
 over
 the
 world
 I
 want


to
 see
 them
 win
 uh
 win
 together
 with
 us


and
 I
 also
 want
 to
 see
 our
 employees
 do


well
 I
 want
 to
 see
 them
 progress
 and
 be


successful
 and
 be
 successful
 for
 their


families
 um
 so
 for
 me
 it's
 moving
 the


brands
 forward
 and
 seeing
 that
 success


play
 out
 for
 all
 the
 people
 who
 are


involved
 in
 the
 system
 and
 which
 part
 of


yourself
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 improve
 so
 I


think
 uh
 one
 thing
 I'd
 like
 to
 improve


is
 uh
 using
 my
 phone
 less
 uh
 I
 think
 I


think
 it's
 something
 that
 distracts


that's
 just
 a
 habit
 that's
 not
 the


proper
 yeah
 more
 philosophically
 more


philosophically
 um
 you
 know
 I
 do
 think


I'm
 trying
 to
 grow
 and
 learn
 as
 a
 leader


I'm
 learning
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 from
 from


Patrick
 in
 in
 that
 respect
 and
 you
 know


I'm
 early
 in
 in
 that
 and
 some
 of
 it's


around
 Communications
 some
 about
 of
 his


about
 leadership
 and
 and
 trying
 to
 steer


a
 very
 large
 organization
 uh
 so
 it's


something
 I'm
 contining
 to
 work
 on
 how


do
 you
 relax
 pretty
 much
 anything
 to
 do


with
 the
 ocean
 uh
 so
 I
 love
 uh
 spear


fishing
 surfing
 sailing
 diving
 sailing


anything
 with
 the
 ocean
 uh
 is
 something


that
 I
 just
 I
 love
 always
 have
 when
 did


that
 start
 shortly
 after
 I
 was
 born
 I


think
 I've
 what
 about
 you
 what
 you
 I'm


actually
 the
 opposite
 Um
 mountains
 schi


yeah
 I
 I
 I
 love
 being
 in
 the
 mountains


that
 is
 that
 is
 my
 happy
 place
 that's


what
 causes
 my
 blood
 pressure
 to
 go
 down


and
 the
 smile
 to
 grow
 on
 my
 face
 and
 you


know
 I
 like
 playing
 golf
 and
 there
 are


some
 other
 things
 but
 I'm
 happiest
 in


the
 mountains
 do
 you
 read
 I
 do
 what
 do


you
 mean
 uh
 you
 know
 mostly
 biography
 a


fair
 amount
 of
 business
 stuff
 I'm
 I'm


reading
 right
 now
 a
 a
 biography
 on
 uh
 on


Rudolph
 diesel
 fascinating
 man
 what
 he


invented
 the
 diesel
 engine
 is


extraordinary
 and
 the
 story
 of
 how
 he


died
 is
 one
 of
 the
 great
 Mysteries
 um
 he


disappeared
 right
 before
 the
 start
 of


World
 War
 I
 and
 his
 engine
 was
 the
 most


efficient
 on
 the
 planet
 It
 ultimately


could
 decide
 who
 was
 going
 to
 win
 World


War
 I
 and
 he
 was
 taken
 off
 the
 map
 um


right
 at
 the
 start
 of
 of
 World
 War
 I
 so


Rudolph
 diesel
 rudol
 diesel
 he
 needs
 to


get
 on
 my
 reading
 list
 it's


fascinating
 and
 we
 got
 tens
 of
 thousands


of
 young
 people
 listening
 to
 this
 what


what
 kind
 of
 advice
 would
 you
 give
 them


I
 I
 would
 say
 work
 hard
 when
 you
 when


you're
 young
 I
 think
 that
 I
 do
 think


that's
 really
 important
 and
 I
 would
 try


to
 I
 would
 make
 decisions
 about
 what
 you


do
 and
 who
 you
 work
 with
 based
 on
 the


people
 pick
 people
 you
 like
 respect
 and


and
 trust
 and
 more
 often
 not
 than
 not


it's
 going
 to
 work
 out
 for
 you
 well
 you


for
 have
 done
 great
 there
 what
 about
 you


what
 do
 you
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 so
 you


know
 for
 me
 it's
 um
 it's
 interesting


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 they
 start
 their


career
 and
 they
 say
 I
 want
 to
 find


something
 that
 I'm
 passionate
 about
 and


to
 my
 mind
 um
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 when
 I
 was


18
 years
 old
 I
 didn't
 think
 what
 I
 was


going
 to
 be
 passionate
 about
 was
 was


leading
 restaurants
 right
 and
 what
 you


find
 is
 that
 the
 passion
 builds
 because


it's
 something
 you're
 good
 at
 and
 you


know
 that
 you
 can
 create
 value
 and
 so
 I


think
 some
 people
 start
 out
 and
 they


have
 the
 end
 in
 mind
 and
 I
 need
 to
 find


that
 perfect
 thing
 that
 I'm
 excited


about
 and
 what
 they
 don't
 realize
 is


that
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 passion
 that


you
 have
 for
 your
 job
 is
 because
 you


grow
 more
 and
 more
 confident
 in
 your


ability
 to
 do
 it
 well
 um
 and
 you
 want
 to


show
 that
 and
 you
 want
 to
 prove
 it
 to


yourself
 and
 you
 want
 to
 prove
 it
 to
 you


know
 your
 family
 and
 your
 friends
 that


I'm
 very
 good
 at
 what
 I
 do
 and
 I
 think


people
 get
 very
 surprised
 to
 find
 that


that
 you
 know
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are


passionate
 about
 accounting
 there
 are


people
 who
 are
 passionate
 about


engineering
 I
 mean
 all
 of
 these


different
 disciplines
 that
 aren't
 maybe


at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 mind
 of
 of
 an


18yearold
 or
 a
 20-year-old
 on
 how
 they


want
 to
 spend
 their
 lives
 um
 but
 they


find
 out
 that
 it's
 extraordinarily


rewarding
 to
 to
 do
 something
 well
 well


you
 guys
 have
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 things


really
 well
 it's
 been
 great
 to
 have
 you


on
 big
 thanks
 for
 taking
 time
 thanks
 for


having
 us
 thank


you


oh
