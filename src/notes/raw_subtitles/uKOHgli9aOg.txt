Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 October
 18th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week
 was
 a
 pretty
 volatile
 week
 in


markets,
 but
 if
 you
 zoom
 out
 a
 bit
 and


see
 that,
 you
 know,
 over
 the
 past
 few


months,
 the
 equity
 market
 could
 only
 go


up,
 but
 now
 it
 looks
 like
 there's
 some


two-sided
 risk.
 Sometimes
 it
 goes
 down.


So
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 change
 in
 the


mood
 of
 the
 market.
 Now
 this
 week,
 we're


still
 in
 a
 government
 shutdown,
 so
 we


don't
 have
 any
 official
 data.
 The


betting
 markets
 are
 suggesting
 that
 the


shutdown
 could
 go
 deep
 into
 November.
 So


maybe
 we
 won't
 have
 data
 for
 some
 time


and
 concerningly
 if
 no
 one's
 working,
 no


one's
 collecting
 the
 data.
 So
 even
 when


the
 government
 opens,
 we
 might
 not


really
 get
 any
 official
 data.
 So
 we're


going
 to
 be
 flying
 blind
 for
 some
 time


today.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 three
 things.


First
 off,
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 the


regional
 bank
 scare
 that
 we
 had
 the
 past


week
 where
 credit
 concerns
 were


prompting
 a
 pretty
 big
 sale
 of
 a
 couple


regional
 banks.
 Secondly,
 let's
 look
 at


some
 private
 data
 to
 see
 where
 the


economy
 might
 be
 heading.
 And
 lastly,
 we


have
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 parabolic
 ascent


of
 gold
 and
 silver.
 All
 right,
 starting


with
 the
 regional
 banks.
 So,
 if
 you
 look


at
 this
 price
 index
 of
 regional
 bank


stocks,
 you
 can
 see
 that
 there
 was
 kind


of
 a
 tumble.
 So
 what
 happened
 was
 that
 a


couple
 regional
 banks
 got
 sold


significantly
 because
 there
 were
 reports


that
 they
 had
 to
 write
 down
 some
 of


their
 loans
 made
 to
 an
 investment
 fund


that
 lost
 money.
 Now
 this
 is
 occurring


uh
 during
 a
 broader
 context
 where
 there


seems
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 concern
 in


the
 credit
 markets
 about
 uh
 you
 know


maybe
 credit
 is
 not
 as
 good
 quality
 as


as
 the
 pricing
 suggests.
 So
 credit


spreads
 are
 still
 pretty
 tight.
 Now,
 in


the
 past
 few
 months,
 we've
 had
 the


bankruptcies
 of
 two
 pretty
 large


companies.
 We
 had,
 which
 was
 a
 company


that
 basically
 specialized
 in
 lending
 uh


to
 illegal
 immigrants,
 and
 also
 First


Brands,
 which
 was
 a
 company
 that
 uh
 had


a
 lot
 of
 business
 in
 auto
 parts.
 Now,


those
 two
 companies
 are
 both
 privately


held,
 so
 there
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 same


public
 disclosures,
 but
 it's
 easy
 to
 see


them
 as
 idiosyncratic.
 So
 when
 it
 comes


toricolor
 of
 course
 the
 president
 has
 a


uh
 different
 immigration
 policy
 he's


enforcing
 immigration
 law
 now
 and
 so
 you


know
 when
 your
 clients
 are
 getting


deported
 obviously
 that's
 not
 going
 to


be
 good
 for
 business
 when
 it
 comes
 to


first
 brands
 there's
 some
 allegations
 of


potential
 fraud
 and
 there's
 always
 fraud


in
 the
 corporate
 space
 right
 so
 you
 know


maybe
 these
 two
 failures
 could
 just
 be


idiosyncratic
 or
 you
 know
 maybe
 they're


systemic
 of
 something
 that's
 a
 lot


deeper
 and
 so
 with
 that
 cloud
 in
 mind


the
 market
 was
 very
 jumpy
 when
 it
 came


to
 reports
 that
 uh
 these
 regional
 banks


had
 lost
 some
 money.
 But
 over
 this
 past


week
 was
 also
 a
 very
 big
 week
 for
 bank


earnings.
 So
 we
 can
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and


we
 can
 kind
 of
 look
 broadly
 to
 see


whether
 or
 not
 there's
 a
 systemic
 risk.


Maybe
 there's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 bad
 loans


or
 maybe
 these
 are
 just
 really


idiosyncratic
 events
 and
 the
 market
 is


getting
 a
 bit
 too
 jumpy.


Now
 first
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 mega


banks.
 Obviously
 if
 you
 are
 a
 bank
 you


have
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 data.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 have
 deposing


accounts
 with
 you.
 You
 make
 loans.
 So,


you
 have
 your
 finger
 on
 the
 pulse.
 Now,


looking
 at
 Bank
 of
 America,
 you
 can
 see


that,
 you
 know,
 they're
 saying
 credit


quality
 is
 is
 really
 good.
 It's
 actually


improving,
 right?
 So,
 they're
 a
 huge


ginormous
 bank
 and
 but
 again,
 there's


just
 one
 bank.
 What
 if
 it's
 just


something
 in
 the
 regional
 banks?
 So,
 if


we
 look
 at
 the
 large
 regional
 banks,


let's
 say
 Truest,
 what
 are
 they
 saying


in
 their
 earnings
 presentation?
 You
 can


see
 they're
 saying
 the
 same
 thing.


credit
 quality
 is
 not
 just
 fine
 but
 it's


getting
 better.
 Loan
 loss
 reserves


coming
 down,
 charge
 offs
 also
 declining.


Uh
 what
 about
 uh
 US
 Bank
 also
 a
 large


regional
 bank
 saying
 the
 same
 thing
 and


actually
 uh
 basically
 all
 the
 regional


banks
 are
 saying
 the
 same
 thing
 as
 are


the
 big
 banks.
 Credit
 quality
 so
 far
 in


the
 banking
 system
 appears
 to
 be
 uh


improving.
 Now
 one
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 note


keep
 in
 mind
 is
 that
 after
 the
 great


financial
 crisis
 the
 structure
 of
 the


banking
 system
 has
 changed
 significantly


such
 that
 when
 we
 do
 have
 credit
 issues


they're
 really
 unlikely
 to
 come
 from
 the


banking
 sector.


So
 in
 the
 great
 financial
 crisis
 the


banks
 made
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 bad
 loans


and
 those
 bad
 loans
 caused
 them
 to
 lose


a
 lot
 of
 money
 which
 in
 turn
 caused
 a


banking
 crisis
 that
 basically
 morphed


into
 a
 great
 financial
 crisis.
 The


regulators
 don't
 want
 that
 to
 happen


because
 consumers,
 households
 view
 bank


deposits
 as
 safe
 assets,
 even
 though


technically
 they're
 not
 safe.
 You're


lending
 unsecured
 to
 a
 bank.
 But
 when


people
 put
 money
 in
 a
 bank,
 they
 think


of
 it
 as
 safe.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 have


issues
 in
 the
 banking
 sector,
 that


causes
 panics.
 So
 they
 put
 on
 all
 these


regulations
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 banks


became
 much
 more
 conservative.
 So
 today


a
 lot
 of
 lending
 actually
 happens
 um


through
 the
 what
 they
 call
 shadow
 banks.


So
 for
 example
 before
 the
 great


financial
 crisis
 the
 commercial
 banks


made
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 mortgages.
 Today


most
 mortgages
 are
 actually
 originated


from
 mortgage
 lending
 companies
 that
 are


not
 banks
 that
 are
 just
 basically


private
 financial
 companies.
 And
 you
 can


say
 similarly
 with
 many
 other
 things


right.
 So
 uh
 let's
 say
 that
 you
 are
 a


middle
 market
 company.
 If
 you
 want
 to


get
 a
 loan,
 you
 could
 go
 to
 a
 bank,
 but


increasingly
 you
 or
 you
 could
 go
 to
 a


private
 investor
 like
 a
 private
 uh


credit
 fund
 and
 get
 a
 loan
 there.


Um
 if
 you
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 of
 bank


loan
 growth
 over
 the
 past
 year,
 you
 can


see
 that
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of
 loan


growth
 from
 the
 commercial
 banks
 is
 not


to
 say
 uh
 corporations,
 but
 it's
 to


what's
 called
 uh
 non
 non
 uh
 non-bank


financial
 institutions.
 Well,


non-depository
 financial
 institutions,


basically
 financial
 companies
 that
 are


not
 banks.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 that


chart,
 you
 can
 see
 there's
 a
 big
 jump.


Part
 of
 it
 was
 because
 of
 a


reclassification.
 So
 in
 any
 case,
 banks


like
 to
 lend
 to
 these
 private
 financial


companies
 and
 then
 these
 private


financial
 companies
 then
 lend
 to
 the


real
 economy.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 bank
 lending


today
 is
 done
 indirectly.


And
 so
 when
 there
 are
 credit
 problems,


let's
 say
 a
 company
 can't
 pay,
 it's
 a


problem
 for
 the
 shadow
 bank
 for
 the


private
 non-bank
 lender
 and
 then
 the


private
 mom
 lender
 will
 have
 to
 deal


with
 it.
 Now
 before
 it
 goes
 up
 to
 the


bank
 level,
 the
 private
 lender
 is
 going


to
 have
 to
 exhaust
 their
 resources.
 And


so
 it's
 an
 extra
 layer
 of
 safety
 for
 the


commercial
 banks.
 So
 the
 commercial


banks,
 they're
 lending
 to,
 let's
 say,
 a


Blackstone
 or
 a
 Polo,
 basically
 these,


you
 know,
 fancy
 sophisticated


uh
 financial
 sponsors
 and
 then
 the


credit
 funds
 managed
 by
 these
 guys
 then


go
 and
 do
 the
 lending.
 So
 it's
 in
 my


personal
 view
 very
 unlikely
 for
 there
 to


be
 any
 credit
 problems
 in
 the
 regulated


banking
 sector
 uh
 simply
 because
 so
 much


of
 the
 risk
 has
 basically
 been
 moved
 to


the
 private
 space
 and
 there
 you
 could


have
 some
 issues
 but
 so
 far
 at
 least
 uh


you
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that
 with
 the


with
 the
 public
 traded
 business


developed
 corporations
 the
 BDC's


not
 having
 a
 good
 uh
 quarter
 but
 so
 far


it
 seems
 Okay.
 So,
 we'll
 guess
 we'll


watch
 that
 going
 forward.
 Okay.
 The
 next


thing
 we
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 the
 state


of
 the
 economy.
 So,
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 uh


publicly
 collected
 data
 and
 probably


won't
 have
 it
 until
 deep
 into
 November.


And
 who
 knows,
 maybe
 the
 government


prefers
 it
 this
 way.
 Um,
 but
 we
 do
 have


some
 clues
 from
 some
 private
 data


sources
 as
 to
 how
 the
 economy
 is
 doing.


Of
 course,
 we
 want
 to
 go
 first
 to
 the


mega
 banks.
 The
 mega
 banks,
 like
 I


mentioned
 earlier,
 have
 their
 finger
 on


the
 pulse
 of
 the
 economy.
 But
 let's
 hear


it
 from
 JP
 Morgan,
 the
 biggest
 bank
 of


the
 them
 all,
 the
 one
 with
 the
 most
 uh
 I


guess
 most
 data
 on
 the
 real
 economy.


When
 asked
 about
 the
 state
 of
 the


consumer
 on
 their
 earnings
 call,
 JP


Morgan
 basically
 said
 the
 consumer
 is


fine.
 Everything
 is
 okay.
 They
 don't


really
 see
 any
 stresses.
 And
 you
 know
 if


you
 look
 at
 say
 card
 spending
 data
 from


American
 Express
 you'll
 also
 get
 the


same
 picture
 as
 well.
 Card
 spending
 is


up.
 Now
 to
 be
 clear
 American
 Express
 and


maybe
 JP
 Morgan
 probably
 has
 a
 more


affluent
 slice
 of
 the
 consumer
 market.


But
 we
 also
 got
 the
 Fed's
 beige
 book


last
 week.
 So
 even
 as
 the
 government


shut
 down
 the
 Fed
 continues
 to
 work.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 they
 do
 is
 they
 go
 and


they
 talk
 to
 all
 their
 contacts
 in


industry
 and
 try
 to
 get
 a
 qualitative


sense
 as
 to
 how
 the
 businesses
 are


performing.
 Now
 according
 to
 the
 beige


book
 the
 economy
 is
 you
 know
 it's
 not


great
 but
 it's
 not
 bad.
 It's
 basically


uh
 just
 kind
 of
 um
 install
 speed
 right


now.
 So
 the
 beige
 book
 suggests
 that
 you


know
 hiring
 is
 is
 is
 low
 but
 you
 know


there's
 not
 like
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


firing.
 Consumer
 spending
 among
 the


affluent,
 good
 among
 the
 less
 affluent,


not
 as
 great,
 but
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


still
 basically
 at
 stall
 speed.
 So


that's
 kind
 of
 consistent
 with
 what's


been
 happening
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months.


So
 looks
 like
 it
 hasn't
 deteriorated
 so


far.


But
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 puzzle
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 economy
 right
 now
 is
 the


divergence
 between
 the
 labor
 data
 and


GDP
 growth.
 Now
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


Atlanta
 Fed,
 uh
 again
 Atlanta
 Field


still
 works.
 Their
 GDP
 now
 estimates
 are


really
 high
 according
 to
 their
 GDP


estimates
 everything
 is
 booming.
 Now
 you


can
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 market
 and
 maybe


draw
 some
 conclusions
 there.
 But
 as
 we


all
 know,
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 not
 the


economy.
 It's
 honestly
 less
 and
 less


related
 as
 time
 goes
 on.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 we
 also
 know
 that
 hiring
 is
 slow.


So
 how
 can
 you
 have
 strong
 GDP
 growth


when
 you're
 not
 having
 more
 workers,


right?
 In
 order
 to
 produce
 more
 goods


and
 services,
 you
 have
 to
 have
 more


people
 working.
 So
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 a


conundrum
 that
 I
 think
 is
 is
 the
 topic


duour
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 economy
 and


also
 what
 the
 Fed
 is
 struggling
 as
 well.


If
 you're
 an
 optimist,
 you
 could
 say


that
 maybe
 there's
 this
 huge


productivity
 boost
 maybe
 due
 to
 AI


that's
 causing
 companies
 to
 be
 much
 more


productive
 without
 growing
 their
 labor


force.
 Although
 I
 would
 point
 out
 that


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 anecdotes
 that


suggest
 that
 AI
 actually
 isn't
 really


super
 productivity
 enhancing
 for
 most


companies
 probably
 helps
 a
 bit
 in
 coding


but
 then
 uh
 they
 also
 say
 that
 uh
 the


engineers
 have
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to


fix
 the
 bugs
 in
 the
 AI.
 So
 uh
 one
 of


these
 data
 measurements
 is
 wrong.
 Either


GDP
 is
 too
 high
 or
 labor
 market
 is
 not


as
 bad
 as
 people
 think.
 So
 this
 is


something
 we'll
 find
 out
 probably
 not


for
 some
 time
 since
 there's
 no
 official


data
 and
 again
 maybe
 maybe
 the


authorities
 like
 it
 that
 way.
 Okay,
 the


last
 thing
 we
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 the


parabolic
 ascent
 of
 gold
 and
 silver.
 Now


if
 you
 are
 a
 subscriber
 to
 to
 my
 work,


you
 know
 that
 I
 have
 a
 market
 view


portfolio.
 The
 whole
 year
 basically
 we


had
 no
 equities
 exposure
 but
 we
 did
 have


about
 50%
 weight
 in
 gold.
 Now
 that


sounded
 very
 strange
 earlier
 in
 the


year,
 but
 hopefully
 a
 little
 bit
 less


strange
 today.
 Gold
 has
 basically
 gone


parabolic,
 far
 outperforming
 the
 equity


market.
 And
 of
 course,
 it's
 little


brother
 silver
 has
 as
 well.
 Now,
 I
 think


this
 is
 actually
 really
 good
 because
 I'm


happy
 that
 gold
 is
 going
 up,
 but
 I
 think


it's
 also
 really
 worrying.
 Uh
 when


things
 go
 up
 slowly,
 that's
 great.
 you


know,
 slow
 and
 steady
 wins
 the
 race.
 But


once
 you
 reach
 this
 kind
 of
 parabolic


ascent,


you
 know,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 correct


sideways.
 The
 parabolic
 asense
 usually


correct
 violently
 downwards.
 And
 also,


you
 don't
 really
 know
 uh
 when
 these
 when


the
 correction
 ends
 or
 when
 the


parabolic
 ascent
 stops.
 Now,
 if
 you
 zoom


out
 and
 look
 at
 silver,
 for
 example,
 you


can
 see
 throughout
 the
 decades,
 it's


just
 gone
 straight
 up,
 but
 every
 time


it's
 gone
 straight
 up,
 it's
 also
 gone


straight
 down.
 And
 to
 some
 extent
 gold


does
 this
 as
 well.
 So
 what
 are
 the


drivers
 for
 this
 huge
 rally
 in
 gold.
 You


know
 honestly
 in
 a
 bull
 market
 everyone


is
 a
 genius.
 So
 everyone
 has
 their


theories
 as
 to
 why
 the
 price
 goes
 up
 and


then
 when
 they
 see
 the
 price
 goes
 up


they
 think
 their
 theory
 is
 correct
 and


then
 they
 say
 and
 then
 they
 feel
 like
 a


genius
 and
 they
 buy
 more.
 But
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 you
 know
 is
 that
 really
 why


gold
 is
 going
 up?
 So
 again
 we
 talked


about
 last
 time
 the
 debasement
 trade


very
 popular
 gold
 is
 going
 up
 because


the
 dollar
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 depreciating


debasing
 going
 to
 zero
 but
 then
 again


inflation
 is
 at
 3%
 or
 more
 a
 better


market
 signal
 would
 be
 uh
 the
 10-year


Treasury
 yield
 right
 around
 4%.
 If
 you


were
 having
 a
 massive
 dollar
 view


basement,
 if
 you
 were
 having
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 inflation,
 you


would
 not
 expect
 a
 10-year
 yield
 to
 be


at
 4%,
 right?
 So,
 this
 this
 basement


stuff
 is
 obvious
 nonsense.
 But
 people


who
 believe
 that,
 you
 know,
 they're


buying
 gold,
 gold
 prices
 go
 up,
 they


feel
 smart,
 maybe
 they
 buy
 more.
 Uh,


another
 popular
 narrative
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 maybe
 there's
 tremendous
 amounts


of
 geopolitical
 risk
 in
 the
 world,
 but


so
 far
 it
 looks
 like
 Middle
 East
 war


risk
 is
 going
 lower.
 And
 in
 addition
 to


that,
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 president
 wants


to
 speak
 with
 President
 Putin
 again.
 So


maybe
 there's
 a
 potential
 future


deescalation
 in
 geopolitical
 risk
 as


well.
 So
 that
 doesn't
 seem
 likely
 as


well.
 So
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 this
 is


just
 momentum
 basically
 what
 drives
 a


lot
 of
 assets
 today.
 Price
 goes
 up,
 so


you
 buy
 more,
 you
 lever
 up,
 you
 buy
 more


again.
 And
 that's
 probably
 why
 you
 can


have
 these
 violent
 reactions
 like
 we
 saw


on
 Friday
 where
 you
 had
 kind
 of
 a
 sudden


tumble,
 especially
 in
 silver.
 Whereas


people
 become
 levered
 um


they
 feel
 greedy,
 lever
 up
 more
 and
 that


makes
 it
 more
 volatile
 and
 more
 fragile.


Now
 one
 other
 thing
 that
 I'll
 note
 is


that
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years
 uh
 a
 lot


of
 people
 have
 commented
 that
 you
 know


maybe
 that
 gold
 is
 not
 doing
 not


performing
 as
 well
 because
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 would
 buy
 gold
 people
 who
 are


afraid
 of
 let's
 say
 the
 fiscal


unsustainability


who
 want
 to
 have
 quote
 unquote
 hard


assets
 are
 instead
 buying
 crypto.
 Now,


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 price
 of
 Bitcoin
 now,


it
 did
 well
 uh
 for
 most
 of
 this
 year,


but
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months,
 it
 just


really
 hasn't
 gone
 anywhere.
 And
 and


honestly,
 it
 looks
 like
 it's
 trending


lower.
 And
 reports
 suggest
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 really
 levered
 last
 week.
 A


lot
 of
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 And
 so,
 if


Bitcoin,
 if
 they're
 souring
 on
 Bitcoin,


maybe
 some
 of
 those
 guys
 will
 go
 back
 to


gold,
 which
 actually
 has
 performed
 very


well
 uh
 so
 far.
 Uh
 but
 in
 any
 case,
 you


know,
 when
 you're
 going
 parabolic,
 you


don't
 know
 how
 high
 you
 can
 go,
 but


ultimately
 uh
 I
 think
 there's
 there's


significant
 risk
 of
 a
 sharp
 pullback.


And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 Friday
 was
 the


case.
 That
 actually
 seemed
 kind
 of
 mild.


Um
 but
 that
 is
 probably
 coming
 going


forward.
 So
 it's
 reason
 to
 be
 cautious.


But
 again,
 not
 telling
 you
 it's
 bearish


because
 you
 don't
 really
 know
 how
 high


the
 parabola
 can
 go.
 All
 right.
 So


that's
 all
 I
 prepared
 for
 today.
 Thanks


so
 much
 for
 tuning
 in
 and
 I'll
 talk
 to


you
 guys
 next
 week.
