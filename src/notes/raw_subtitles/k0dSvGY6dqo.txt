As
 wildfire
 seasons
 grow
 longer
 and


deadlier,
 states
 are
 increasingly


relying
 on
 private
 companies
 to
 provide


thousands
 of
 firefighters
 to
 the
 front


lines.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Hannah
 Dryer


explains
 how
 lacks
 rules
 and
 regulatory


loopholes
 have
 left
 many
 of
 these


firefighters
 sick,
 in
 debt,
 and
 on
 their


own.


It's
 Tuesday,
 October
 28th.


[Music]


Hannah,
 it
 feels
 like
 every
 year
 there


are
 more
 and
 more
 wildfires
 and
 you
 have


spent
 months
 investigating
 one
 specific


aspect
 of
 wildfires,
 which
 is
 the


wildfire
 fighting
 industry.
 So,
 I'd
 love


to
 start
 off
 with
 you
 telling
 us
 what


got
 you
 interested
 in
 that
 particular


angle.
 I
 first
 started
 thinking
 about


this
 after
 the
 fires
 that
 tore
 through


Los
 Angeles
 in
 January.
 I
 saw
 that
 there


was
 all
 this
 footage,
 all
 these
 pictures


coming
 in
 of
 the
 people
 who
 were


fighting
 those
 fires.
 And
 I
 couldn't


help
 but
 notice
 that
 there
 were
 all
 of


these
 firefighters
 out
 there
 standing
 in


what
 looked
 like
 the
 most
 toxic
 black


smoke
 and
 none
 of
 them
 were
 wearing


masks.
 And
 it
 got
 me
 wondering
 why
 is


that?
 And
 what
 might
 be
 the
 consequences


of
 working
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 environment


with
 no
 protection?
 And
 so
 I
 started


digging
 into
 the
 industry
 of
 people
 who


fight
 wildfires.
 And
 what
 I
 discovered


is
 that
 it's
 completely
 unlike
 any


industry.
 They
 are
 out
 there
 in
 these


really
 hazardous
 conditions
 and
 they


work
 without
 protection.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


them
 are
 getting
 very
 sick
 at
 young


ages.
 And
 when
 they
 develop
 things
 like


severe
 lung
 damage
 or
 cancer,
 things


that
 are
 linked
 to
 this
 smoke
 exposure,


they're
 often
 on
 their
 own.
 often
 they


don't
 even
 have
 basic
 health
 insurance.


>> So
 basically
 they're
 vulnerable
 at


several
 different
 stages
 of
 this
 process


from
 starting
 work
 to
 actually
 getting


sick.


>> Exactly.
 I
 mean
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people


have
 told
 me
 is
 they
 feel
 like
 they
 put


their
 health
 on
 the
 line
 to
 protect


people
 and
 then
 when
 they
 get
 sick


themselves
 there's
 sort
 of
 no
 one
 there


protecting
 them.


>> And
 this
 is
 not
 a
 small
 issue.
 There
 are


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 people
 who
 do
 this


work
 almost
 year
 round
 now.
 And
 as


wildfire
 season
 grows
 longer
 and
 gets


more
 intense,
 this
 is
 something
 that
 is


just
 going
 to
 become
 more
 and
 more


urgent.
 So
 to
 get
 my
 arms
 around
 this,
 I


talked
 to
 hundreds
 of
 firefighters.
 Many


of
 them
 were
 very
 sick,


>> but
 there
 was
 one
 story
 that
 really


stood
 out
 to
 me.


>> Hi,
 come
 on
 in.
 I'm
 Matt.
 I'm
 Joel's


dad.


>> This
 is
 a
 young
 man
 named
 Joel
 Eisinger.


>> So,
 can
 we
 go
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 your


childhood
 and
 start
 there?
 just
 a
 lot
 of


riding
 bicycles
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 races.


>> Joel
 was
 a
 shy
 kid
 who
 moved
 around
 a


lot.
 He
 didn't
 always
 have
 an
 easy
 time


making
 friends.
 He
 was
 really
 physical.


He
 went
 on
 long
 hikes,
 long
 bike
 rides.


He
 played
 lacrosse
 in
 high
 school
 and


his
 nickname
 was
 battering
 ram.
 But
 he


had
 a
 hard
 time
 focusing
 in
 school.


Sometimes
 he
 didn't
 go
 to
 class.
 He
 sort


of
 barely
 managed
 to
 graduate.
 And
 once


he
 graduated,
 he
 wasn't
 sure
 what
 he
 was


going to
 do.


>> Uh,
 got
 a
 job
 at
 Taco
 Bell.


>> He
 was
 living
 in
 Oregon.
 He
 got
 a
 job
 at


Taco
 Bell.
 And
 one
 night,


>> I
 watched
 a
 movie
 called
 Only
 the
 Brave.


>> I
 worked
 this
 blaze
 near
 Big
 Timber,


Montana.


>> He
 started
 watching
 this
 movie
 on
 TV


called
 Only
 the
 Brave.


>> No
 matter
 what's
 going
 on,
 we
 can't
 go


back
 up
 there.
 Stay
 together.
 Everyone


here.


>> It's
 a
 movie
 that's
 about
 this
 tragedy


that
 happened
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 where


basically
 an
 entire
 crew
 of
 wildland


firefighters
 died
 burned
 by
 a
 fire.


>> Soup.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 thank
 you
 for


pulling
 me
 out
 earlier.


>> It
 was
 definitely
 an
 ass
 pucker,
 wasn't


it?


>> No
 doubt,
 man.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 dying.


>> And
 it's
 this
 tragic
 movie,
 but
 his


reaction
 to
 it
 was
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 bond


between
 these
 crew
 members.


>> This
 ain't
 the
 greatest
 job
 in
 the


world.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 is.


>> Got
 that
 right.


>> So,
 in
 the
 movie,
 these
 guys
 are
 always


joking.
 They're
 really
 close.
 And
 that


really
 appealed
 to
 Joel.
 I
 mean,
 he's


working
 at
 like
 a
 fast
 food
 restaurant


during
 the
 day.
 And
 to
 him,
 this
 is


like,
 oh
 my
 god,
 it's
 a
 way
 to
 be


outside,
 have
 friends,
 and
 be
 doing
 what


he's
 best
 at,
 which
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 like


physical
 work.
 So,
 the
 very
 next
 day,
 he


goes
 and
 applies
 to
 work
 for
 a
 company


called
 Pacific
 Oasis.


>> And
 what's
 Pacific
 Oasis?
 Pacific
 Oasis


is
 one
 of
 hundreds
 of
 companies
 that
 now


offer
 private
 firefighting
 services
 to


the
 federal
 government.
 And
 these
 are


easier
 jobs
 to
 get
 than
 working
 directly


for
 the
 federal
 government
 doing


firefighting.


>> Like
 less
 red
 tape.


>> Yeah.
 Less
 paperwork
 to
 fill
 out,
 fewer


hoops
 to
 jump
 through.
 You
 can
 get
 hired


on
 the
 spot.
 And
 so
 they
 attract
 a
 lot


of
 people
 like
 Joel
 who
 maybe
 were
 a


little
 a
 drift
 in
 life.
 So
 it's
 an


easier
 job
 to
 get
 than
 working
 for
 the


federal
 government.
 But
 there's
 a


trade-off,
 which
 is
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot


fewer
 protections
 and
 fewer
 benefits.
 So


most
 people
 working
 for
 these
 companies


don't
 have
 health
 insurance,
 for


example.
 They
 have
 less
 training
 and


overall
 they're
 just
 sort
 of
 less


protected.


>> Um,
 so
 at
 Taco
 Bell,
 I
 had
 a
 manager.
 He


brought
 up
 Pacific
 Oasis
 actually.
 So


like
 I
 had
 that
 in
 my
 head
 already
 and


uh
 he
 just
 told
 me
 all
 the
 cool
 stories


and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 sweet,


man."
 You
 know,
 he's
 like,
 "I
 don't
 hire


anybody.
 I
 just
 want


>> So
 Joel
 walks
 in
 the
 door.
 He
 meets
 with


the
 president
 of
 the
 company.
 He's
 like,


"This
 is
 uh
 you're
 exactly
 what
 we're


looking
 for."


>> And
 signs
 him
 up
 for
 training
 straight


away


>> on
 the
 spot.


>> And
 he's
 almost
 immediately
 sent
 out
 to


a
 major
 fire.
 And
 he's
 still
 18
 at
 this


point.
 His
 father,
 Matt,
 remembers


driving
 him
 down
 to
 the
 Pacific
 Oasis


headquarters.


>> So,
 I
 went
 down
 there
 with
 him
 and


dropped
 him
 off
 at
 the
 fire
 like
 it
 was


a
 sporting
 event,
 you
 know what
 I
 mean?


And
 I
 was
 incredibly
 worried
 about
 him,


of
 course,
 as
 I
 I
 think
 most
 parents


would
 be.
 But


>> Matt
 was
 so
 worried
 that
 Joel
 was
 going


to
 go
 out
 in
 this
 really
 dangerous


situation.
 He
 knows
 his
 son
 is
 sort
 of


hard-headed,
 maybe
 sometimes
 push
 his


boundaries.
 And
 he
 knew
 he
 couldn't
 stop


Joel
 from
 signing
 up
 for
 this
 work.
 Joel


was
 determined,
 but
 he
 was
 really


worried.
 Understandably,


>> right?
 So
 Steve
 saw
 me
 just
 nervously


pacing
 and
 waiting.
 and
 he
 Steve
 came
 up


to
 me
 and
 he
 approached
 me
 and
 I
 was


staying
 out
 of


>> and
 Steve
 Dods
 who's
 the
 president
 of


Pacific
 Oasis
 comes
 over
 and
 talks
 to


Matt
 and
 reassures
 him


>> and
 he
 said,
 "Hey,
 we'll
 take
 good
 care


of
 him.
 He's
 going
 to
 be
 all
 right."
 And


anybody
 could
 say
 that,
 but
 I
 truly
 did


believe
 him.
 I
 I
 respected
 him
 at
 that.


>> And
 then
 Joel
 gets
 in
 a
 truck
 and
 he


drives
 off
 to
 his
 very
 first
 fire.


>> So,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 about
 your
 first


fire?
 Uh
 it
 was
 like
 California
 coming


to
 the
 Oregon
 border.
 So
 we
 were
 there


to
 like
 protect
 it
 coming
 into
 Oregon.


>> This
 fire
 was
 called
 the
 Clamathon
 fire.


Every
 fire
 has
 a
 name.


>> So
 we
 were
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 direct
 hand


line.
 So
 that's
 you're
 at
 the
 fire's


edge.
 You're
 digging
 down
 to
 like
 bare


mineral
 soil
 creating
 like
 a
 small
 fire


break
 that
 the
 fire
 stops.


>> So
 fighting
 a
 wildfire
 is
 not
 like
 what


we
 sort
 of
 imagine
 when
 we
 think
 of


firefighting.
 There's
 not
 usually
 water


and
 hoses
 involved.
 It's
 more
 like


you're
 digging
 a
 containment
 line.


>> I
 would
 definitely
 think
 that
 any
 kind


of
 firefighting
 required
 water.
 So,
 this


is
 interesting.


>> I
 mean,
 what
 it
 is
 is
 that
 wildfires
 are


too
 big
 to
 put
 out
 with
 water.
 They
 can


really
 only
 be
 trapped
 and
 contained.


>> You're
 just
 trying
 to
 stop
 it
 from


spreading
 on
 the
 ground.
 Basically,


small
 flames
 smoldering.
 And


>> but
 what
 that
 means
 for
 somebody
 like


Joel
 is
 that
 you're
 just
 working
 right


next
 to
 the
 fire
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 sort
 of


unbelievable.


Joel's
 first
 night
 was
 basically


trapesing
 around
 on
 a
 cliff's
 edge
 right


next
 to
 the
 act
 of
 fire.


>> The
 scariest
 part
 about
 that
 first
 fire


was
 uh
 they
 call
 it
 a
 freight
 train.
 You


start
 hearing
 the
 fire.
 You
 can't
 see


it,
 but
 you
 just
 start
 hearing
 trees


just
 torching
 and
 running.
 It
 sounds


like
 Yeah.
 train.


>> He
 told
 me
 about
 how
 he
 was
 hearing


trees
 snapsh.


>> So,
 he's
 crossing
 checkpoints.


>> National
 Guard
 was
 there.
 Uh
 they
 shut


down
 all
 highways
 now.


>> And
 he
 gets
 to
 drive
 around
 them
 to
 go


to
 this
 sort
 of
 offlimit
 space
 with
 his


crew.


>> Um
 I'm
 like
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 the
 coolest


thing
 ever,
 you
 know.


>> And
 it's
 this
 wild
 unpredictable
 scene.


>> It's
 pure
 chaos,
 dude.
 Flames
 start


ripping,
 wind
 changes


>> where
 he
 is
 right
 next
 to
 these
 flames,


>> fire
 on
 both
 sides
 of
 us.
 It's
 like
 I


look
 up
 like
 a
 200t
 wall
 of
 flames
 just


like
 50
 ft
 away
 from
 me
 and
 I'm
 just


like
 everybody's


>> and
 he's
 starting
 to
 get
 to
 know
 these


guys
 who
 are
 sort
 of
 teaching
 him
 how
 to


be
 out
 there
 and
 stay
 safe
 but
 also


teasing
 him.


>> My
 closest
 friends
 I
 met
 on
 that
 first


fire,
 you
 know,
 I've
 kept
 that
 circle


>> for
 him.
 It
 was


>> everything
 he
 had
 hoped
 it
 might
 be
 to


to
 go
 out
 and
 fight
 a
 wildfire.


[Music]


It
 sounds
 like
 he
 found
 that
 Band
 of


Brothers
 element
 that
 he
 was
 really


drawn
 to.
 Absolutely.
 So
 after
 that,
 he


was
 pretty
 much
 hooked.
 He
 worked
 six


more
 fire
 seasons.
 He
 learned
 to
 work
 a


chainsaw.
 And
 that
 meant
 that
 he
 would


sort
 of
 be
 out
 in
 front
 of
 the
 rest
 of


the
 crew
 leading
 this
 group
 of
 guys
 deep


into
 the
 woods,
 cutting
 down
 trees,


cutting
 down
 flaming
 branches.


>> It
 took
 me
 three
 about
 3
 years
 to
 be


able
 to
 walk
 through
 the
 woods
 without


falling
 over,
 if
 that
 makes
 sense.
 like


with
 a
 chainsaw
 with
 all
 the
 weight
 took


about
 3
 years.


>> He
 would
 be
 hiking
 with
 a
 50
 lb
 pack


just
 you
 know
 him,
 his
 friends
 and


nature.


>> You're
 you're
 removed
 from
 like
 everyday


life
 and
 I
 don't
 like
 everyday
 life


personally.
 So
 it's
 like
 I
 like
 that
 you


know


>> it's
 really
 physically
 demanding
 but
 it


was
 also
 for
 him
 really
 rewarding
 and


made
 him
 proud.
 He
 felt
 like
 it
 was


finally
 something
 that
 he
 was
 just


naturally
 good
 at.


>> Just
 freedom.
 Being
 on
 fires
 doesn't


feel
 like
 a
 job.
 It's
 like
 makebelieve


stuff
 that
 we
 do
 out
 there,
 you
 know?


It's
 just
 fairy
 land
 [ __ ]
 So,
 it's


cool.


>> But
 it
 also
 involved
 a
 lot
 of
 risk.
 He


fell
 down
 a
 burning
 hill
 once.
 He
 almost


cut
 into
 his
 foot
 with
 his
 chainsaw.
 He


got
 full
 body
 poison
 oak.


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 most
 dangerous
 things


about
 the
 work
 was
 a
 natural
 byproduct


of
 fires,
 which
 was
 breathing
 in
 smoke.


and
 nobody
 out
 there
 wore
 masks.
 Why


wouldn't
 they
 wear
 masks?
 Masks
 weren't


provided
 when
 he
 started
 this
 work.
 And


they
 also
 weren't
 allowed.
 And
 this
 is
 a


longtime
 Forest
 Service
 policy.
 And
 what


the
 Forest
 Service
 says
 is
 that
 wearing


a
 mask
 could
 increase
 your
 risk
 of
 heat


stroke.
 The
 work
 is
 really
 taxing.
 It's


usually
 pretty
 hot
 out
 there.
 And
 the


concern
 is
 if
 you're
 out
 there
 with


something
 over
 your
 face,
 maybe
 you


would
 start
 to
 overheat.
 Wildland


firefighters
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world


do
 wear
 masks
 and
 there
 has
 not
 been
 a


heat
 stroke
 issue
 there,
 but
 that's
 what


the
 Forest
 Service
 says.
 But
 there
 was


also
 this
 cultural
 element
 of
 not


wanting
 to
 seem
 weak.
 Firefighters
 sort


of
 see
 masks
 as
 like
 silly
 as
 a
 sign


that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 up
 to
 the


job.
 And
 breathing
 in
 smoke
 is
 seen
 as
 a


sign
 that
 you're
 willing
 to,
 you
 know,


take
 sacrifices
 and
 focus
 on
 the
 work
 at


hand
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 too


caught
 up
 in
 your
 own
 comfort.
 So


basically,
 even
 if
 they
 had
 been


provided
 with
 masks,
 what
 you're
 saying


is
 that
 they
 probably
 wouldn't
 have
 worn


them
 because
 of
 this
 culture.


>> Yeah,
 there
 is
 this
 macho
 fireline


culture,
 but
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 worth


noting
 that
 at
 this
 point,
 firefighters


like
 Joel
 weren't
 told
 that
 there
 was


any
 reason
 to
 be
 concerned
 about
 smoke.


So
 part
 of
 it
 maybe
 is
 that
 they
 thought


that
 the
 masks
 could
 make
 them
 look


weak,
 but
 they
 also
 maybe
 just
 had
 no


reason
 to
 think
 that
 there
 would
 be
 a


real
 benefit
 to
 wearing
 them.


>> But
 the
 smoke
 exposure
 was
 really


intense.
 Pacific
 Oasis
 workers
 told
 me


morning
 sounded
 like
 an
 emphyma
 clinic


in
 their
 fire
 camps.
 They
 were
 coughing.


They
 had
 black
 stuff
 coming
 out
 their


noses.
 There's
 something
 called
 camp


cred
 that
 goes
 around
 these
 fire
 camps


where
 everyone
 will
 be
 coughing
 and


everyone
 will
 be
 sort
 of
 feeling
 sick


and
 people
 just
 think
 of
 it
 as
 like
 a


natural
 consequence
 of
 the
 work.
 For


Joel,
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 being
 sore.
 It


was
 just
 something
 that
 he
 thought
 came


along
 with
 fighting
 fires.
 And
 for
 him,


it
 was
 proof
 that
 he
 was
 doing
 something


right
 and
 he
 was
 putting
 in
 the
 right


amount
 of
 effort.
 He
 was
 really
 focused


on
 trying
 to
 get
 his
 boss
 Steve's


attention
 and
 show
 Steve
 that
 he
 was


tough
 and
 he
 should
 be
 sent
 out
 on
 more


fires
 and
 maybe
 promoted.
 So,
 he
 was


working
 really
 hard.
 He
 was
 trying
 to


impress
 Steve.
 Show
 Steve
 that
 he
 would


make
 any
 sacrifice.
 And


>> he
 would
 cough
 up
 black
 stuff.


>> Exactly.
 Go
 out
 for
 weeks
 and
 weeks


without
 complaining.


and
 he
 was
 getting
 these
 positive


reviews.
 Steve
 seemed
 to
 be
 liking
 what


he
 was
 doing.
 And
 eventually
 Steve


invited
 him
 to
 start
 training
 to
 be
 a


crew
 boss,
 which
 meant
 that
 he
 would


lead
 his
 own
 team
 of
 about
 20
 people.


And
 that
 for
 Joel
 was
 one
 of
 the


proudest
 moments
 of
 his
 life.
 It
 was
 so


validating.


>> Did
 you
 imagine
 spending
 your
 whole


career
 in
 fire?


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 already
 knew
 I
 was
 in.
 Yeah.


I
 knew
 that's
 a
 job
 I
 wanted
 probably


when
 I
 was
 19.
 I
 was
 probably
 going
 to


stick
 with
 that
 one.
 you
 know,
 I'm
 good


at
 it.


I'm
 really
 good
 at
 it.


>> And
 he
 started
 to
 see
 this
 as
 probably


being
 his
 lifelong
 career.


And
 that's
 why
 what
 happened
 next
 felt


like
 such
 a
 betrayal.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Hannah,
 it
 sounds
 like
 Joel
 is


basically
 living
 his
 dream
 life.
 When
 do


things
 start
 taking
 a
 turn
 for
 the
 worst


for
 him?


>> Yeah.
 So
 looking
 back
 at
 it,
 uh
 I
 had
 a


lot
 of
 different
 signs.


>> Everything
 started
 falling
 apart
 last


year.
 It
 was
 the
 4th
 of
 July
 weekend.


>> You
 know,
 I
 was
 extremely
 probably
 the


best
 shape
 I
 ever
 been
 in
 my
 life
 before


that.
 You
 know,


I
 just
 did
 my
 crew
 boss
 class.


>> He
 was
 fighting
 a
 fire
 in
 Northern


California
 staying
 in
 a
 hotel.


>> I
 broke
 out
 in
 a
 rash.


>> He
 had
 this
 strange
 rash
 that
 was
 sort


of
 creeping
 up
 his
 legs


>> my
 body
 and
 it
 was
 so
 painful,
 dude.
 And


I
 didn't
 know
 what
 was
 going
 on.


>> It
 really
 hurt.
 It
 looked
 like
 nothing


he'd
 ever
 seen
 before,
 but
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 complain.


>> And
 we're
 staying
 in
 hotels,
 right?
 So


everybody
 was
 like, "Oh,
 you
 got
 bed


bugs."
 Everybody's
 like
 freaking
 out.


>> And
 so
 he
 let
 it
 slide.
 Then
 his
 crew


moves
 deep
 into
 the
 forest
 and
 they


start
 camping
 there
 to
 get
 closer
 to
 the


fire
 line.


>> And
 day
 nine
 or
 10,
 my
 face
 started
 to


like
 droop.


>> That's
 when
 his
 crew
 mates
 notice
 that


his
 face
 is
 drooping.
 Half
 of
 his
 mouth


is
 sort
 of
 just
 hanging
 open.


>> Every
 fire
 you
 go
 on,
 there's
 going
 to


be
 one
 thing
 that's
 always
 bugging
 you.


You're
 going
 to
 have
 blisters,


something,
 some
 fingernail
 messed
 up.


You're
 going
 to
 have
 something.


>> And
 again,
 he
 wants
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 this,


you
 know,
 tough
 person
 who
 could
 be
 a


crew
 boss.
 And
 so
 he
 keeps
 going,


working
 these
 12-hour
 shifts
 until
 the


end
 of
 their
 deployment.
 That's
 when
 a


medic
 finally
 sees
 him
 and
 says,
 "You


need
 to
 get
 to
 the
 hospital.
 You
 might


have
 had
 a
 stroke."
 Were
 people
 worried


about
 him?
 Do
 we
 know
 during
 the
 period


that
 he's
 working
 with
 a
 a
 drooping


face?


>> You
 know,
 people
 noticed
 it,
 but
 nobody


was
 that
 worried.
 And
 I
 think
 that


partly
 goes
 back
 to
 this
 fire
 line


culture.
 I
 mean,
 firefighters
 say
 if
 you


get
 injured
 out
 on
 the
 fire
 line,
 you


just
 rub
 dirt
 in
 it
 and
 keep
 walking.
 Oh


my
 god.


>> So,
 everybody
 is
 just
 very
 focused
 on


getting
 this
 fire
 under
 control
 and


keeping
 going
 sort
 of
 no
 matter
 what


happens.


>> So,
 the
 medic
 tells
 him,
 "You
 need


urgent
 medical
 attention.
 Does
 he
 go
 to


a
 hospital?
 Does
 he
 heed
 that
 advice?"


>> So,
 Joel
 opts
 not
 to
 take
 an
 ambulance.


He
 instead
 is
 driven
 by
 Steve,
 the
 owner


of
 the
 company.


>> And
 in
 my
 opinion,
 I'm
 going
 to
 the


hospital,
 right?
 So,
 but


>> he
 thinks
 that
 Steve
 is
 going
 to
 take


him
 to
 the
 hospital.
 That's
 sort
 of
 the


protocol
 for
 a
 moment
 like
 that.


>> Mhm.
 Instead,
 he
 was
 driven
 90
 minutes


back
 from
 the
 fire
 line.
 And
 then
 he's


surprised
 because
 Steve
 drops
 him
 off
 at


his
 dad's
 house.
 It's
 almost
 midnight
 at


this
 point.
 He
 looks
 drawn.
 He
 looks


weak.


>> You
 could
 have
 asked
 me
 what
 color
 this


guy
 was
 and
 I
 probably
 didn't
 know.


That's
 how
 just
 messed
 up
 I
 was.
 You


know,
 my
 body
 was
 just
 shutting
 down.


>> When
 I
 saw
 him
 in
 that
 state,
 I
 knew


this
 isn't


a
 cold.


>> And
 his
 dad
 realized
 that
 something
 is


terribly
 wrong
 here.
 I
 drove
 to
 the


hospital
 thinking
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 die


at
 any
 moment.
 I
 knew
 it.


>> And
 immediately
 takes
 him
 to
 the


emergency
 room.


>> There's
 no
 going
 back
 from
 something


like
 that
 happening
 as
 a
 parent.


>> So,
 at
 the
 hospital,
 doctors
 start


running
 tests
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 few
 days
 of


tests
 and
 Joel
 is
 getting
 weaker
 and


weaker.
 At
 this
 point,
 he
 can't
 even


really
 walk
 down
 the
 hallway.
 And


eventually,
 they
 come
 back
 with
 an


answer
 that
 nobody
 expects.
 He
 is


diagnosed
 with
 acute
 myoid
 leukemia,


which
 is
 an
 aggressive
 blood
 cancer
 that


is
 most
 often
 seen
 in
 people
 in
 their


60s
 and
 70s.
 Not
 somebody
 Joel's
 age.


>> And
 how
 old
 was
 he
 at
 that
 point?


>> He
 is
 diagnosed
 the
 day
 before
 he
 turns


25.


>> Wow.


>> That
 moment
 it's
 still
 in
 jog
 for
 him.


So
 feels
 fake,


>> but
 it's
 not.
 You
 know,


>> he
 needs
 immediate
 chemotherapy,


immediate
 blood
 transfusions.


That
 rash
 that
 was
 creeping
 up
 his
 legs


turns
 out
 to
 have
 been
 his
 blood


basically
 just
 breaking
 down
 without


treatment.
 He
 could
 die
 within
 a
 matter


of
 weeks.
 And
 the
 truth
 is,
 even
 with


medical
 interventions,
 only
 about
 half


of
 patients
 with
 this
 kind
 of
 cancer


survive
 a
 year.
 But
 all
 Joel
 is
 thinking


about
 in
 these
 days
 is
 how
 quickly
 he


can
 get
 through
 treatment
 and
 get
 back


to
 fighting
 fires.


>> So
 I
 was
 really
 excited,
 man,
 to
 go
 back


with
 that
 crew.
 I
 was
 locked
 in
 with


that
 crew,
 but
 it
 was
 a
 good
 crew.
 They


got
 the
 most
 hours
 out
 of
 any
 of
 the


crews,
 you
 know.


>> He's
 sort
 of
 not
 understanding
 how


serious
 the
 situation
 is,
 how
 in
 danger


he
 is
 of
 dying,


and
 he's
 just
 focused
 on
 this
 life
 that


he
 thought
 was
 in
 front
 of
 him.
 It


sounds
 like
 he
 almost
 couldn't
 accept


the
 reality
 of
 what
 was
 actually


happening
 to
 his
 body.
 Yes.
 I
 mean,
 it's


so
 jarring
 for
 him,
 like
 he
 just
 can't


really
 process
 what's
 going
 on.
 But
 for


his
 father,
 the
 reality
 was
 very
 clear.


And
 he
 was
 thinking
 back
 to
 that
 first


day
 when
 he
 dropped
 off
 Joel
 and
 Steve


said
 that
 he
 would
 take
 care
 of
 his
 son.


>> He
 got
 dropped
 off
 at
 my
 doorstep
 by
 the


same
 person
 not
 seven
 years
 prior
 had


told
 me,
 "Hey,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 care


of
 him."


>> For
 his
 part,
 Steve
 says
 that
 he


understood
 that
 this
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a


long
 diagnostic
 process
 for
 Joel.
 it


wasn't
 going
 to
 be
 a
 quick
 thing
 and
 he


was
 trying
 to
 do
 Joel
 a
 favor
 by
 letting


him
 rest
 at
 home
 and
 then
 go
 into
 the


hospital
 the
 next
 day.
 But
 Matt
 just


cannot
 get
 over
 that
 moment,
 that


nightmare
 moment
 of
 seeing
 your
 child.


He
 felt
 like
 on
 death
 store
 and
 they're


being
 taken
 to
 your
 house
 instead
 of


taken
 to
 get
 medical
 care.


>> They
 let
 him
 linger
 out
 there
 having


facial
 paralysis,
 drooling,
 and
 all
 this


stuff
 going
 on.
 He
 had
 no
 control
 over


his
 muscles,
 pain.
 He
 wasn't
 okay.


>> And
 what
 happened
 to
 him
 really
 could


have
 happened
 at
 any
 private


firefighting
 company.
 No
 matter
 who
 he


worked
 for,
 he
 would
 probably
 have
 been


out
 there
 without
 a
 mask
 in
 heavy
 smoke


and
 he
 might
 have
 ended
 up
 in
 this
 exact


situation
 at
 the
 hospital
 sick
 with


cancer.


But
 I
 think
 that
 for
 Matt
 and
 eventually


for
 Joel,
 they
 got
 really
 fixated
 on


these
 specifics
 of
 where
 he
 got
 dropped


off,
 what
 time
 it
 was
 because
 they
 felt


like
 Joel
 was
 just
 sort
 of
 dumped,
 like


he
 had
 been
 a
 disposable
 worker
 all


along.
 And
 so
 they
 felt
 really
 mad.
 And


meanwhile,
 all
 of
 these
 medical
 bills


started
 to
 come
 in.


>> I
 was
 paying
 that
 first
 hospital
 bill.
 I


didn't
 have
 insurance.
 I
 was
 paying
 that


[ __ ]
 out
 of
 my
 pocket,
 right?
 He
 and


Matt
 felt
 like
 Pacific
 Oasis
 should
 be


held
 accountable
 since
 he
 had
 gotten


sick
 on
 their
 watch.
 And
 workers


compensation
 covers
 things
 like
 lost


wages
 and
 hospital
 bills
 when
 employees


get
 sick
 on
 the
 job.
 So
 Joel
 and
 Matt


decide
 they
 are
 going
 to
 file
 a
 workers


compensation
 claim.
 They
 go
 down
 to


Pacific
 Oasis
 and
 Steve
 pulls
 them
 into


a
 room


>> room
 and
 said
 there's
 no
 way
 you
 guys


can
 prove
 this
 is
 workrelated.
 And
 I


said
 what?


>> He
 basically
 said
 anything
 could
 have


caused
 this.
 trying
 our
 best.


>> Our
 workers
 compensation
 policy
 is
 not


going
 to
 pay
 for
 this.


>> I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 prove
 anything.
 I'm


just
 trying
 to
 say
 that
 this
 happened
 to


him
 on
 a
 fire.
 Let's
 get
 him
 covered


right
 now
 until
 we
 can
 figure
 this
 out.


You
 know what
 I
 mean?


>> But
 they
 filed
 the
 claim
 anyway.
 And


ultimately,
 the
 workers
 comp
 insurer


denies
 their
 claim.


>> So,
 I
 was
 just
 using
 money
 out
 of
 out
 of


pocket
 basically.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> Out
 of
 pocket.


>> And
 why
 couldn't
 they
 prove
 this
 link?


It's
 almost
 impossible
 to
 prove
 that
 any


individual
 cancer
 case
 comes
 from


wildfire
 smoke.
 And
 that
 sort
 of
 shields


the
 whole
 firefighting
 industry
 from


responsibility.


People
 who
 work
 at
 the
 Forest
 Service


have
 told
 me
 that
 this
 is
 one
 reason


that
 firefighters
 historically
 have
 not


been
 provided
 with
 masks
 because
 if
 you


give
 somebody
 a
 mask,
 it's
 essentially


acknowledging
 that
 smoke
 is
 risky
 and


could
 cause
 some
 sort
 of
 long-term


illness.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a


mask
 that
 could
 protect
 you
 because
 that


would
 be
 an
 admission
 that
 you
 are
 in


danger
 doing
 this
 work.
 So
 therefore,
 we


were
 going
 to
 leave
 you
 unprotected.


This
 is
 what
 whistleblowers
 have
 been


telling
 me
 that
 there's
 just
 sort
 of


been
 this
 culture
 of
 denial
 around
 how


dangerous
 smoke
 is
 because
 what
 do
 you


do
 once
 you
 acknowledge
 that
 you
 have
 to


really
 change
 how
 fires
 are
 fought?


>> The
 government
 might
 start
 to
 have
 to


provide
 more
 staffing
 so
 that
 people


could
 take
 breaks
 from
 smoke.
 Then
 they


might
 have
 to
 start
 covering
 this
 whole


range
 of
 health
 conditions.
 Okay.
 So
 the


employers
 don't
 acknowledge
 a
 link


between
 the
 work
 and
 the
 illness
 here.


But
 is
 there
 a
 link
 between
 the
 work
 and


the
 type
 of
 cancer
 that
 Joel
 got?
 Like


what
 do
 we
 know
 about
 that
 for
 sure?
 So


until
 the
 1980s,
 people
 thought
 that


wildfire
 smoke
 was
 basically
 benign
 like


a
 campfire.
 But
 since
 then,
 there's
 been


a
 lot
 of
 research
 that
 has
 shown
 pretty


definitively
 that
 wildfire
 smoke
 is


linked
 to
 cardiovascular
 issues,
 lung


issues,
 and
 at
 least
 12
 kinds
 of


cancers.
 So,
 responding
 to
 this
 growing


body
 of
 research,
 in
 2022,
 Congress


actually
 forced
 the
 Forest
 Service
 to


start
 offering
 workers
 compensation


benefits
 for
 a
 list
 of
 more
 than
 a
 dozen


cancers
 that
 are
 most
 strongly


associated
 with
 smoke
 exposure.
 But


that's
 not
 how
 it
 works
 for
 this
 large


group
 of
 other
 firefighters
 working
 on


contract
 for
 the
 Forest
 Service,
 but


working
 for
 private
 companies.
 So


basically,
 if
 you
 work
 directly
 for
 the


federal
 government
 fighting
 fires,
 you


will
 get
 coverage.
 But
 if
 you
 work
 for
 a


private
 company
 that
 works
 for
 the


Forest
 Service,
 you
 will
 not
 get


coverage.
 Exactly.
 So
 if
 you've
 had,
 you


know,
 Joel's
 career
 and
 then
 you
 develop


leukemia
 and
 you're
 working
 for
 the


Forest
 Service,
 you
 now
 don't
 have
 to


prove
 where
 your
 cancer
 came
 from.
 It's


just
 assumed
 that
 it
 came
 from
 your
 work


on
 fires
 because
 there's
 such
 a
 strong


link.
 But
 for
 Joel,
 he
 would
 have
 to


prove
 where
 his
 cancer
 came
 from,
 which


is
 almost
 impossible.


>> So
 basically,
 for
 somebody
 like
 Joel,
 he


is
 completely
 on
 his
 own,
 it
 sounds


like,
 to
 cover
 the
 cost
 of
 his


treatment.


>> Yes.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 imagine,
 it
 was


extremely
 expensive.
 The
 family
 spent


basically
 everything
 they
 had
 trying
 to


pay
 for
 this.
 And
 how
 was
 Joel
 doing


through
 all
 of
 this?
 Was
 the
 treatment


working?


The
 chemotherapy
 starts
 to
 fight
 back


the
 cancer,
 but
 it
 takes
 a
 tremendous


physical
 toll
 on
 Joel.
 He
 could
 barely


move.
 He
 was
 in
 pain
 all
 the
 time.
 He


would
 crawl
 up
 to
 his
 attic
 bedroom
 on


hands
 and
 knees.
 By
 the
 winter
 though,


he
 started
 to
 get
 better.
 His
 cancer


went
 into
 remission
 and
 he
 started


recovering
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 strength.
 He


went
 out
 with
 his
 father
 to
 try
 to
 go
 on


a
 hike
 like
 he
 used
 to
 do
 with
 him.
 And


at
 first
 he
 could
 only
 take
 these
 sort


of
 stuttering
 steps,
 but
 little
 by


little
 he
 was
 able
 to
 recover
 a
 little


bit
 of
 of
 who
 he
 had
 been.
 It
 sounds


like
 he
 beat
 the
 odds.


I
 mean,
 he
 went
 into
 remission.
 His


doctors
 were
 very
 careful
 to
 explain


that
 the
 cancer
 could
 come
 back
 at
 any


time,
 and
 it
 often
 does.
 And
 if
 it
 did


come
 back,
 chemotherapy
 wouldn't
 be


enough.
 He
 would
 have
 to
 have
 a
 bone


marrow
 transplant.
 But
 after
 Joel
 got


the
 sign
 off
 from
 his
 doctors
 in
 the


spring,
 he
 sort
 of
 went
 back
 to
 that


place
 of
 aimlessness
 that
 he
 had
 been
 in


after
 graduating
 high
 school.
 He
 didn't


quite
 know
 what
 to
 do.
 He
 felt
 a
 drift


and
 his
 mind
 started
 drifting
 back
 to


fighting
 fires.
 He
 started
 sort
 of


fantasizing
 about,
 well,
 like
 what
 if
 I


went
 back
 there?
 He
 wanted
 to
 go
 back
 to


the
 line.


>> He
 wanted
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 line.
 It's


where
 his
 friends
 are.
 It's
 a
 way
 to


start
 making
 money
 to
 pay
 off
 his
 debts.


>> And
 Joel
 is
 very
 hung
 up
 on
 that
 last


fire
 that
 he
 fought
 and
 how
 he
 got
 sick


and
 he
 wasn't
 able
 to
 to
 keep
 going.
 He


really
 sees
 that
 as
 a
 defeat.
 And
 in
 a


lot
 of
 ways,
 he
 says
 he
 wants
 to
 redeem


himself
 by
 getting
 back
 out
 on
 the
 fire


line.


>> Sure,
 I'm
 motivated.
 I
 can
 go
 do
 fire,


but
 can
 I
 do
 a
 14-day
 run?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Probably
 try
 till
 I
 die
 again.
 You
 know,


that's
 one
 of
 those
 things.


>> Some
 pretty
 tough.


>> He
 actually
 went
 and
 asked
 Steve
 for
 his


job
 back
 and
 Steve
 told
 him,
 "Are
 you


crazy?
 You're
 think
 that
 firefighting


gave
 you
 this
 cancer.
 You're
 going
 to
 go


back.
 Isn't
 that
 tempting
 fate?"
 So


Steve
 wouldn't
 hire
 him.
 He
 couldn't
 get


a
 job
 locally.
 So
 he
 bought
 a
 ticket
 to


go
 to
 Alaska
 where
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 more


federal
 wildland
 firefighting
 jobs.


>> Wow.
 And
 Matt
 desperately
 wants
 Joel
 to


do
 any
 kind
 of
 work
 besides


firefighting.
 But
 he
 also
 knows
 that
 if


he
 pushes
 too
 hard,
 he
 could
 alienate


Joel.
 So
 he's
 walking
 this
 really
 fine


line.


>> Even
 though
 everybody's
 telling
 me
 I'm


insane,
 but
 I
 don't
 care
 what
 anybody


thinks.
 Like
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it's


just
 all
 all
 I
 know.


>> His
 kind
 of
 cancer
 is
 very
 aggressive.


It
 doesn't
 have
 a
 great
 prognosis.
 In


his
 mind,
 he
 is
 likely
 still
 to
 die
 from


this
 cancer.


>> If
 I
 got
 if
 I
 got
 a
 year
 left
 in
 my


life,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 the
 last
 year


doing
 some
 [ __ ]
 I'd
 enjoy,
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 the
 damage
 is
 already
 done,


right?


>> No.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 too
 late
 to


turn
 back.
 I
 mean,
 [ __ ]


>> He
 feels
 like
 everything
 he's
 doing
 now


is
 just
 sort
 of
 borrowed
 time.
 And
 if
 he


ends
 up
 dying
 in
 his
 20s,
 he
 wants
 to


just
 keep
 going
 and
 keep
 being
 that


strong
 firefighter.


It
 really
 strikes
 me
 that
 there
 will


always
 be
 a
 Joel.
 There
 will
 always
 be


people
 who
 need
 this
 kind
 of
 work,
 who


want
 to
 do
 this
 kind
 of
 work,
 and
 an


industry
 that
 needs
 Joles,
 right?
 It's


true.
 There
 are
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


wildland
 firefighters.


And
 as
 wildfire
 season
 grows
 longer
 and


the
 fires
 grow
 more
 intense,
 the


government
 is
 increasingly
 turning
 to


firefighters
 like
 Joel
 and
 people
 get


into
 this
 work
 young.
 They
 really
 want


to
 do
 it.
 And
 when
 they
 get
 sick,
 the


industry
 just
 sort
 of
 moves
 on
 and


there's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 another
 young


person
 to
 come
 and
 replace
 them.


Hannah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you,


Rachel.


Not
 long
 after
 Hannah
 published
 the


first
 story
 in
 this
 investigative

Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.
 Today,
 Prime


Minister
 Andrew
 Holes
 of
 Jamaica
 ordered


mandatory
 evacuations
 and
 issued
 dire


safety
 warnings
 as
 Hurricane
 Melissa,


with
 winds
 of
 175
 mph,
 and
 enough


moisture
 to
 drop
 nearly
 3
 ft
 of
 rain,


churned
 toward
 his
 country
 and
 its
 2.8


million
 people
 on
 Monday.
 Dangerous


winds,
 catastrophic
 flooding,
 and
 a


storm
 surge
 as
 high
 as
 13
 ft
 were


expected
 in
 Jamaica
 as
 soon
 as
 Monday


night,
 long
 before
 the
 hurricane's


expected
 landfall
 on
 Tuesday
 morning.
