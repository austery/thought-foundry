I
 remember
 when
 I
 got
 cast
 as
 the
 bad


guy
 in
 Miss
 Congeniality
 2:
 Armed
 and


Fabulous.
 I
 got
 a
 small
 but
 nice
 chunk


of
 change.
 And
 I
 thought,
 "Oh,
 instead


of
 spending
 this
 on
 an
 indiscretion
 or


an
 indulgence,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 a
 really


nice
 band
 saw."

>> I'm
 Christine
 Zerette.
 I'm
 Kyra


Blackwell.
 I'm
 Rosie
 Garren
 and
 you're


listening
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


[Music]


>> Hi
 guys.


>> Hey
 there.


One
 thing
 I've
 learned
 about
 the
 Wire


Cutter
 team
 is
 beyond
 their
 passion
 for


talking
 about
 gear
 that
 hopefully
 will


help
 folks
 live
 better,
 you
 know,
 great


chef's
 knife,
 a
 sewing
 machine,
 maybe


the
 right
 pen
 for
 journaling,
 is
 an


inner
 light,
 an
 excitement
 when
 that


sentiment
 is
 shared
 by
 someone
 else
 in


the
 world,
 particularly
 someone
 famous.


In
 this
 case,
 I'm
 referencing
 tools


specifically.


>> Absolutely.
 It's
 kind
 of
 funny.
 It's
 few


and
 far
 between
 that
 there's
 actually


someone
 famous
 who
 really
 geeks
 out
 to


the
 level
 that
 people
 at
 Wire
 Cutter


will
 geek
 out
 on
 different
 products.
 But


about
 six
 years
 ago,
 Nick
 Offerman,
 who


is
 famous
 actor,
 if
 you
 haven't
 watched


Parks
 and
 Recreation,
 go
 back
 and


familiarize
 yourself
 with
 Ron
 Swanson.


He
 tweeted
 about
 this
 S-wing
 hammer
 that


he
 really
 loves.
 and
 he
 pointed
 to
 our


hammer
 review
 which
 was
 written
 by
 Doug


Mahoney
 who
 has
 been
 on
 the
 show
 before


and
 since
 then
 tons
 of
 people
 at


Wirecutter
 have
 been
 like
 it
 would
 be
 so


great
 to
 have
 him
 on
 the
 site
 it
 would


be
 so
 great
 to
 get
 him
 involved
 with
 the


review
 can
 we
 get
 him
 to
 test
 hammers


for
 us
 you
 know
 it's
 been
 on
 our
 bucket


list
 to
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 to
 him
 and
 the


thing
 is
 Ron
 Swanson
 the
 character
 is


really
 big
 on
 woodworking
 but
 I
 didn't


even
 know
 that
 Nick
 Offerman
 the
 man


he's
 actually
 been
 a
 professional


woodworker
 for
 decades
 he
 started


Offerman
 wood
 shop
 his
 own
 shop
 over
 20


years
 ago
 before
 he
 even
 made
 it
 big
 in


Hollywood.
 He
 also
 wrote
 a
 bunch
 of


books
 and
 he's
 got
 a
 new
 one
 out
 called


Little
 Woodchucks,
 which
 is
 so
 cute.


It's
 a
 woodworking
 guide
 for
 kids,
 but


really
 it's
 more
 of
 a
 love
 letter
 to


anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 slow
 down,
 get
 their


hands
 dirty,
 and
 learn
 how
 to
 build


something
 real.
 This
 book
 has
 everything


from
 beginner
 projects
 like
 carving


little
 creatures
 with
 a
 whiddling
 knife


to
 even
 more
 ambitious
 builds.
 We
 had
 a


blast
 talking
 with
 Nick.
 He
 is
 just
 as


funny
 as
 you
 would
 expect.
 And
 uh
 this


conversation
 is
 actually
 a
 bit
 different


than
 we
 usually
 have
 in
 our
 episodes.
 We


do
 talk
 with
 Nick
 about
 his
 favorite


tools
 and
 gear,
 but
 we
 also
 delve
 into


some
 headier
 territory.
 We
 talk
 about


why
 woodworking
 continues
 to
 be
 one
 of


his
 enduring
 passions,
 what
 he
 gets
 out


of
 it,
 and
 why
 he
 thinks
 that
 everyone


should
 really
 slow
 down
 and
 start
 making


things
 by
 hand.


>> It's
 a
 great
 conversation.
 We
 should


also
 say
 this
 episode
 does
 have
 some


adult
 humor
 in
 it,
 so
 please
 take
 care


when
 you're
 listening
 with
 your
 kids.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 With
 us
 now
 is
 Nick


Offerman,
 who
 you
 probably
 know
 as
 Ron


Swanson
 on
 Parks
 and
 Recreation.
 He's


not
 only
 an
 accomplished
 actor,
 though.


He's
 a
 skilled
 woodworker
 who's
 founded


his
 own
 woodworking
 collective
 in
 LA,


and
 it's
 called
 Offerman
 Wood
 Shop.
 He's


also
 a
 published
 author
 of
 now
 six


incredible
 books.
 His
 latest
 being


Little
 Woodchucks,
 which
 released
 on


October
 14th.
 Nick,
 welcome
 to
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that
 generous


introduction.
 Nick,
 you
 might
 be


interested
 to
 know
 that
 the
 staff
 at


Wire
 Cutter
 is
 pretty
 obsessed
 with
 you


and
 has
 been
 for
 some
 time
 because
 we


know
 that
 you're
 into
 tools,
 that
 you're


a
 woodworker.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 curious
 about
 just
 the


fact
 that
 you're
 such
 a
 big
 celebrity,


but
 you're
 also
 you've
 got
 this
 life


moonlighting
 as
 a
 as
 a
 woodworker.


>> What
 got
 you
 into
 woodworking
 in
 the


first
 place?
 Was
 this
 something
 that
 you


did
 as
 a
 kid?
 Is
 it
 something
 that
 you


picked
 up
 as
 an
 adult?
 How
 did
 it
 start?


>> Um,
 well,
 thank
 you.
 There
 there
 are


some
 compliments
 in
 there.
 I
 I


appreciate
 it.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 it's
 funny


to
 hear
 you
 describe
 your
 crowd
 here.


This
 book
 is
 exactly
 for
 you
 all
 because


when
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 my
 mom
 and
 dad
 brought


up
 me
 and
 my
 three
 siblings
 in
 a


farmhouse
 that
 my
 dad
 got
 for
 free
 and


rolled
 down
 the
 road
 to
 like
 a
 and
 set


it
 down
 on
 a
 basement
 that
 he
 poured.


And
 it
 was
 Little
 House
 on
 the
 Prairie.


Like
 for
 real,
 we
 we
 made
 so
 much
 stuff.


Mom
 made
 clothes.
 She
 and
 dad
 both
 come


from
 farm
 families
 a
 few
 miles
 in
 either


direction.
 So
 I
 grew
 up
 surrounded
 by


family
 members
 who
 make
 things
 of
 all


sorts.
 And
 the
 farmers,
 you
 know,
 they


have
 to
 be
 amazing
 mechanics
 and


carpenters
 and
 painters
 and
 cooks
 and


tailor
 and
 cobblers
 and
 you
 name
 it.
 Um


because
 everything
 has
 to
 be
 incredibly


frugal
 to
 survive
 year
 in
 and
 year
 out.


And
 so
 growing
 up,
 it
 was
 just
 part
 of


my
 hero
 worship
 of
 adults.
 Like
 when
 I


when
 I
 grow
 up,
 when
 I
 come
 into
 my


manhood,
 it
 means
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 back
 a


wagon
 of
 corn
 into
 the
 crib.
 And
 it


means
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 hammer
 a
 nail
 in


one
 blow.
 I'll
 be
 able
 to
 use
 the


chainsaw
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 so
 I
 just


always
 had
 a
 fascination
 with
 tools,


with
 the
 implements
 that
 we
 clever


monkeys
 have
 come
 up
 with
 to
 affect


change
 on
 the
 raw
 materials
 of
 life
 to


like
 make
 our
 lives
 better.
 And
 my
 dad


was
 an
 amateur
 furniture
 maker.
 He
 made


some
 really
 cool
 pieces
 of
 furniture.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 those
 uh


influences
 combined
 so
 that
 when
 I
 was


strong
 enough
 as
 a
 teenager
 to
 like
 get


a
 labor
 job,
 I
 was
 drawn
 to
 framing


houses
 to
 like
 swinging
 a
 hammer.
 And


so,
 at
 age,
 I
 think
 15
 or
 16,
 I
 got
 my


first
 job
 framing
 houses
 for
 these


brothers
 in
 town.
 And
 to
 just
 suddenly


be
 paid
 a
 man's
 wage
 for
 climbing
 a


ladder,
 like
 having
 an
 adventure
 up
 on
 a


third
 story
 roof,
 like
 cutting
 rafters


and
 hammering
 into
 place,
 just
 felt


super
 heroic.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 always
 loved


uh
 making
 some
 of
 my
 livelihood
 with


tools,
 even
 though
 then
 I
 went
 to


theater
 school.
 I
 wanted
 to
 become
 an


actor.
 So
 while
 I
 was
 there,
 there
 was


this
 guy
 named
 Ken
 Egan
 running
 this


beautiful
 scene
 shop
 uh
 at
 this
 facility


at
 the
 University
 of
 Illinois
 called
 the


Cranert
 Center.
 and
 this
 guy
 hired
 me
 to


work
 in
 the
 scene
 shop.
 And
 so
 that
 was


my
 first
 shop.
 Suddenly
 my
 mind
 exploded


where
 I
 was
 like
 I
 learned
 what
 a
 these


big
 wood
 shaping
 machines
 were,
 a
 planer


and
 a
 joiner
 and
 a
 dust
 collection


system
 and
 like
 how
 to
 run
 a
 great
 wood


shop.
 And
 so
 even
 as
 I
 became
 a
 young


adult
 as
 a
 theater
 actor,
 I
 also
 that


was
 my
 origin
 story
 as
 a
 woodworker


where
 I
 was
 like
 I
 I
 can
 shape
 things


with
 wood
 tools.


I
 will
 thrive.


>> Well,
 I
 want
 to
 know
 that
 the
 new
 book


is
 called
 Little
 Woodchucks
 and
 it's


really
 about
 projects
 to
 do
 with
 kids.


In
 the
 intro
 to
 the
 book,
 you
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 how
 important
 it
 is
 to
 know
 how
 to


make
 things
 with
 your
 hands.
 And
 um
 I


can
 identify
 with
 this.
 I
 sew
 a
 lot
 of


my
 own
 clothing.
 I
 taught
 my
 kids
 how
 to


sew.
 I
 think
 it's
 important,
 but
 it's


also
 a
 lot
 of
 work.
 And
 sometimes
 I'm


like,
 I
 could
 just
 go
 buy
 something
 for


a
 fraction
 of
 the
 price
 and
 the
 time


involved
 with
 this.
 What
 is
 the
 argument


today
 in
 2025
 to
 make
 things
 with
 your


hands,
 to
 spend
 the
 time
 and
 effort
 and


all
 of
 that?
 And
 sometimes
 it's
 kind
 of


expensive
 to
 get
 into
 making
 things
 by


hand.
 What's
 the
 argument?


>> Well,
 let
 me
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 all
 the


way
 back
 to
 soil
 health.


Things
 are
 about
 to
 get
 real
 sexy.
 I


agree
 with
 you.
 And
 I
 in
 the
 intro
 to
 my


last
 book
 uh
 called
 Where
 the
 Deer
 and


the
 Analopee
 Play.
 I
 talk
 about
 our


relationship
 with
 nature
 and
 all
 my


alarms
 start
 going
 off
 as
 I'm
 writing


because
 this
 is
 not
 good
 television.


This
 is
 not
 sexy.
 like
 everybody's
 going


to
 sleep
 because
 that's
 what
 consumerism


does
 so
 effectively
 is
 it
 says
 to
 you,


why
 don't
 you
 just
 buy
 what
 you
 need


from
 the
 corporations
 and
 then
 sit
 on


your
 couch
 and
 enjoy
 our
 diversions


while
 our
 robots
 service
 your
 wife
 for


you,
 you
 know.
 And
 I
 personally
 would


like
 to
 take
 care
 of
 some
 of
 those


responsibilities
 myself.
 I
 feel
 like


it's
 our
 duty
 as
 citizens
 to
 maintain


to,
 you
 know,
 no
 pun
 intended,
 like
 keep


a
 hand
 in
 to
 the
 construction
 and


maintenance
 of
 our
 civilization.
 So,


there's
 the
 responsibility
 side
 of
 it,


but
 I
 also
 think
 it's
 just
 really
 fun.


If
 we
 were
 in
 Little
 House
 on
 the


Prairie,
 they
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 Like,
 if


you
 got
 a
 deck
 of
 cards
 and
 a
 sewing


machine
 and
 a
 hammer,
 you
 can
 have
 a


really
 a
 really
 good
 time.
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 part
 of
 the
 answer
 to
 that


question
 of
 like
 if
 we
 all
 just
 say
 why


don't
 we
 just
 border
 it
 off
 your
 phone.


We
 we'll
 throw
 our
 planet
 in
 the


garbage.
 That's
 what
 makes
 me
 so
 happy


to
 hear
 when
 people
 love
 tools.
 I
 mean


it's
 becoming
 really
 rare
 that
 people


know
 what
 a
 tool
 is.


>> It
 was
 important
 for
 us
 making
 this


show.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 conversations
 we
 end


up
 having
 are
 about
 things
 that
 are


built
 to
 last.
 What
 are
 the
 things
 that


you
 can
 invest
 in
 that
 will
 last
 if
 not


a
 lifetime
 than
 decades?


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 especially
 when


you're
 starting
 out
 as
 a
 woodworker,
 uh,


good
 tools
 are
 expensive.
 Um,
 and
 so


naturally
 there
 are
 all
 kinds
 of


laborsaving
 devices
 and
 gadgets
 and


cheap
 versions
 of
 things
 that
 at
 first


seem
 like
 a
 a
 great
 idea
 and
 then
 when


it
 breaks
 or
 breaks
 your
 heart
 time


after
 time
 you
 finally
 say,
 "Okay,
 it's


you
 get
 what
 you
 pay
 for."
 And
 these


good
 beautiful
 hand
 planes
 or
 chisels
 or


what
 have
 you
 or
 or
 machines
 are
 worth


the
 money.
 And
 incredibly,
 like
 when


when
 I'm
 outfitting
 a
 shop,
 I
 do
 my


damnedest.
 I
 work
 really
 hard
 to
 find


machines
 from
 the
 60s
 and
 70s
 that


require
 absolutely
 no
 maintenance
 or
 or


refurbishment
 that
 are
 10
 times
 better


than
 what
 you
 can
 get
 today
 because


things
 are
 being
 made
 for
 the
 company's


profitability
 rather
 than
 your
 use.


[Music]


This
 book
 that
 you
 just
 came
 out
 with
 is


about
 projects
 for
 kids.
 And
 I've


noticed
 that
 with
 my
 own
 kids,
 there's


this
 thing
 that
 happens
 where
 they're


not
 on
 a
 screen.
 They're
 like
 in
 front


of
 the
 sewing
 machine.
 They're
 having
 to


push
 through
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 make


this
 thing.
 And
 it
 does
 kind
 of
 push


them
 to
 be
 more
 patient
 working
 on
 this


book.
 Did
 you
 find
 that
 process
 was


happening
 with
 these
 kids
 at
 all?
 Like


were
 you
 making
 these
 projects
 with
 the


kids
 and
 they
 were
 having
 to
 kind
 of


push
 through
 and
 get
 past
 their
 own


impatience
 with
 themselves?


>> For
 sure.
 And
 it's
 really
 interesting
 to


see
 kids
 today
 like
 kids
 that
 are


growing
 up
 with
 the
 technology
 they
 have


versus
 the
 kids
 I've
 known
 in
 other


generations.
 And
 thankfully,
 I
 mean,
 I'm


really
 relieved
 to
 see
 these
 cool
 kids


that
 that
 agreed
 to
 come
 be
 in
 our
 book.


You
 can
 see
 their
 distraction,


but
 then
 you
 would
 see
 them
 click
 in.
 I


would
 work
 with
 them
 to
 whatever


operation
 we
 were
 doing
 to
 get
 them
 to


feel
 the
 correct
 use
 of
 the
 tool.
 And


that's
 a
 big
 moment
 just
 teaching
 them


the
 difference
 between
 driving
 a
 screw


with
 a
 drill
 horizontally
 versus
 getting


your
 weight
 up
 on
 top
 of
 it
 and
 feeling


how
 much
 more
 effective
 that
 is.
 If
 you


read
 the
 whole
 book,
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 not


so
 veiled
 screed.
 Not
 just
 for
 the
 kids,


it's
 for
 the
 parents,
 too.
 I
 want
 I


write
 it
 with
 a
 great
 sense
 of
 humor
 so


that
 hopefully
 people
 will
 be
 engaged
 to


read
 it
 out
 loud
 to
 their
 kids.
 So
 I
 I'm


hoping
 to
 awaken
 this
 in
 everybody
 cuz
 I


think
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 big
 wood
 trucks


as
 well
 these
 days
 who
 also
 never
 use


tools
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 fun
 and
 a


lot
 easier
 to
 do
 it
 together.


>> I
 had
 a
 question
 because
 it
 still


surprises
 me
 and
 I
 know
 you
 wrote
 this


in
 your
 book.
 You
 will
 still
 make


mistakes.
 you,
 Nick
 Offerman,
 who's
 been


doing
 this
 for
 years,
 and
 that's
 both


inspiring
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 intimidating,


I
 think,
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 myself


included.
 I'm
 not
 handy.
 I
 can't
 build


anything.
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 you
 have


any
 advice
 for
 people
 like
 me
 who
 aren't


that
 patient,
 but
 they
 want
 to
 learn
 and


they
 want
 to
 experience
 that
 joy
 of
 like


creating
 something
 by
 hand.


>> Well,
 yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 a


great
 life
 lesson
 because
 I
 mean
 I


learned
 early
 on
 in
 everything
 I
 do
 that


if
 I
 make
 clumsiness
 part
 of
 my
 brand


then
 when
 I
 fall
 on
 my
 face
 they
 laugh


and
 they
 give
 me
 money
 and
 I
 say
 that's


that's
 what
 I
 do.
 Mission
 accomplished.


I
 hope
 you
 enjoyed
 that.


>> But
 I
 mean
 with
 woodworking
 it's
 it's
 a


great
 example
 like
 one
 of the
 fun
 things


about
 making
 a
 table
 or
 anything
 in
 the


shop
 is
 it's
 a
 puzzle.
 It's
 uh
 solving
 a


series
 of
 problems
 and
 understanding


that
 you
 have
 to
 lay
 those
 problems
 out


in
 the
 right
 order.
 You
 can't
 cut
 this


before
 you
 cut
 this.
 And
 you
 got
 if
 you


look
 through
 the
 steps
 of
 one
 of
 the


projects
 in
 my
 book,
 I
 think
 it's
 easy


to
 understand
 if
 you
 don't
 maintain


focus.
 It's
 just
 easy
 to
 make
 brain


fart,
 you
 know,
 like
 simple
 errors.


>> But
 I
 love
 it.
 It
 makes
 me
 I
 rarely
 get


mad
 at
 myself
 or
 at
 my
 family
 because
 I


understand
 if
 somebody
 makes
 a
 mistake.


I'm
 like
 sure
 that's
 what
 we
 do.
 We're


humans.
 Like
 we're
 built
 to
 make


mistakes.
 No
 one
 ever
 does
 anything


perfectly
 on
 the
 first
 try.
 And
 so
 I


make
 I
 make
 less
 mistakes
 the
 older
 I


get.
 Knock
 on
 wood
 to
 a
 certain
 point


and
 then
 I
 guess
 then
 it
 go
 starts
 going


back
 the
 other
 direction.


My
 wife's
 uncle
 was
 a
 luier.
 He
 made


guitars
 and
 he
 made
 her
 a
 guitar.
 And


she
 was
 talking
 to
 me
 about
 how
 he
 would


take
 the
 wood
 options
 and
 lay
 his
 hands


on
 them
 and
 kind
 of
 knock
 them
 and
 ask


her
 to
 sing
 so
 that
 he
 could
 match
 wood


tone
 with
 the
 tone
 and
 timber
 of
 her


voice.
 And
 it
 struck
 me
 as
 like
 this


really
 spiritual


practice.
 And
 so
 I
 guess
 I'm
 wondering


for
 you,


religion
 is
 personal,
 but
 is
 there
 kind


of
 a
 spiritual
 or
 meditative


aspect
 to
 the
 way
 that
 you
 work
 with


wood
 and
 the
 way
 that
 you
 work
 with
 your


hands?


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 our


heroes
 of
 the
 field,
 George
 Nakashima,


look
 it
 up.
 It's
 gorgeous
 work.
 His


daughter
 Meera
 is
 still
 running
 it.


They're
 still
 cranking
 out
 Nakushima


pieces.
 And
 he
 has
 a
 wonderful
 book


called
 The
 Soul
 of
 a
 Tree.
 And
 he
 and


James
 Krenov,
 who
 has
 a
 school,
 they


both
 are
 sort
 of
 two
 of
 the
 spiritual


hearts
 of
 of
 woodworking.
 And
 there
 is


that
 elfin
 sensibility
 of
 like
 if
 you're


making
 a
 guitar
 or
 a
 dining
 room
 table,


you
 know,
 you
 meet
 your
 clients
 and


you're
 making
 the
 board
 on
 which
 they're


going
 to
 have
 their
 family
 dinners


hopefully
 for
 generations.
 And
 so
 that


is
 holy.
 I
 mean,
 that
 really
 feels
 like


a
 wonderful
 and
 touching
 responsibility.


In
 in
 the
 sole
 of
 a
 tree,
 George
 talks


about,
 you
 know,
 the
 wood
 will
 tell
 you


sort
 of
 what
 it
 wants
 to
 be
 or
 or


>> how
 thick
 or
 thin.
 You're
 trying
 to


strive
 for
 this
 meditative
 sensibility.


Sometimes
 there
 are
 noisy
 tools.


Sometimes
 things
 are
 are
 violent
 or
 or


you're
 bashing
 things,
 you
 know.
 But


then
 there
 are
 moments
 where
 you're


planing
 wood
 or
 shaving
 it
 or
 or


finishing
 it
 where
 you
 can
 have
 music


playing
 or
 the
 tools
 themselves
 are


making
 a
 kind
 of
 music
 where
 it
 it
 is


quite
 spiritual.
 There's
 a
 passage


Wendel
 Barry
 writes
 in
 I
 think
 it's
 in


his
 novel
 the
 memory
 of
 old
 Jack
 where


he
 talks
 about


you
 used
 to
 get
 to
 town
 only
 at
 the


speed
 of
 walking
 or
 the
 fastest
 would
 be


the
 speed
 of
 a
 horse.
 And
 so
 you


maintained
 a
 knowledge
 of
 the
 health
 of


your
 neighborhood.
 You
 saw
 the
 creek.


You
 saw
 your
 neighbors
 houses.
 And
 you


had
 time
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 look.
 Looks
 like


they
 painted
 the
 barn
 or
 they're
 taking


good
 care
 of
 their
 sunflowers."
 Or
 the


opposite,
 like
 I
 looks
 like
 Bob
 might
 be


drinking
 again.


The
 faster
 we
 go
 in
 our
 society,
 the


less
 we
 are
 able
 to
 pay
 attention.
 And


so
 the
 the
 less
 we
 communicate
 with
 our


community
 to
 say
 my
 laundry
 is
 well


hung,
 Bob
 was
 successfully
 on
 the
 wagon


and
 so
 forth.
 And
 so
 in
 the
 shop,
 we
 try


to
 honor
 that.
 And
 it's
 a
 fine
 line


because
 I'm
 not
 going
 for
 the
 greatest


profitability.
 I
 do
 my
 best
 to
 have
 my


shop
 break
 even.
 That's
 my
 my
 goal
 every


year.
 But
 that
 allows
 everybody
 to
 work


at
 the
 pace
 of
 a
 horse
 or
 walking
 and


and
 I
 think
 that
 enjoyment
 goes
 into
 the


beauty
 of
 the
 pieces
 that
 we
 make.


>> I
 was
 talking
 to
 a
 friend
 last
 night
 who


said
 I
 I
 was
 telling
 her
 that
 you
 were


going
 to
 be
 here
 today
 and
 she


immediately
 said,
 "Oh,
 I
 have
 his


coasters."
 And
 she
 was
 very
 excited.
 Um,


but
 it
 made
 me
 wonder
 about
 the
 actual


place
 you
 do
 your
 work.
 So,
 are
 you


working
 on
 personal
 projects
 at
 the


Offermanwood
 Shop,
 or
 do
 you
 have
 a


dedicated
 space
 in
 your
 home?
 And
 if
 so,


can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 visual?
 Walk
 us


through.


>> Sure.
 Um,
 I
 I'm
 not
 allowed
 to
 make


sawdust
 where
 I
 share
 a
 marriage
 bed


with
 Megan
 Mali.


She's
 going
 to
 hear
 this.
 I'm
 going
 to


get
 in
 trouble.


>> Yeah.


>> For
 insinuating
 that
 we've
 made
 love.


Um,


so
 I
 have
 a
 a
 shop
 across
 town
 on
 the


east
 side
 of
 LA
 and
 I'm
 wonderfully


spoiled.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 used
 to
 uh


have
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 dining
 tables
 to


make
 my
 rent
 and
 now
 the
 shop
 is
 is
 I've


got
 such
 great
 woodworkers
 there
 that


I'm
 able
 to,
 you
 know,
 I
 remember
 when
 I


got
 cast
 as
 the
 bad
 guy
 in
 Miss


Congeniality
 2:
 Armed
 and
 Fabulous.
 I


got
 a
 nice
 uh
 small
 but
 nice
 chunk
 of


change
 and
 I
 thought,
 "Oh,
 instead
 of


spending
 this
 on
 an
 indiscretion
 or
 or


an
 indulgence,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 a
 really


nice
 band
 saw
 from
 the
 Lagona
 bandsaw


folks."
 And
 so
 that
 beca
 started
 a
 habit


where
 every
 time
 I
 would
 get
 a
 a
 nice


acting
 job,
 I
 would
 buy
 a
 new
 machine.


And
 so
 now
 I
 have
 a
 space
 sort
 of
 up
 in


a
 loft
 where
 daddy
 can
 just
 keep
 his


mess.
 That's
 the
 pull
 quote.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 like
 the
 idea
 though
 of
 a
 wood
 shop


full
 of
 beautiful
 things
 that
 are


expensive
 and
 a
 metaphor
 for
 your
 career


success.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 kind
 of
 special,


>> I
 guess.
 So,
 yeah,
 it's
 weird.
 It's
 I


never
 could
 have
 imagined
 how
 much
 my


tool
 use
 would
 lend
 sucker
 to
 my
 dreams


of
 a
 life
 of
 artistry.


to
 the
 point
 where
 like
 uh
 they
 even


made
 Ron
 a
 woodworker
 because
 of
 my
 shop


and
 we
 shot
 a
 few
 episodes
 in
 my
 shop.


Like
 Ron's
 shop
 is
 shot
 at
 Offerman
 Wood


Shop.


>> No
 way.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 awesome.


>> And
 those
 his
 canoes
 are
 my
 canoes
 that


I
 built.
 Like
 there
 are
 a
 few
 things


that
 Ron
 builds
 in
 the
 show
 that
 are


comedy
 woodworking.
 Like
 he
 builds
 an


Irish
 harp
 overnight.


And
 by
 the
 time
 we
 got
 into
 later


episodes,
 there's
 one
 where
 I
 either


build
 a
 crib
 for
 Chris
 Trager
 or
 we


build
 it
 together
 or
 something.


>> I
 remember
 that.
 Yeah.


>> And
 it
 was
 like
 I
 became
 unavailable


where
 they
 were
 like,
 we
 need
 a
 crib
 by


Tuesday.
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 I
 have
 to
 learn


my
 lines.
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 build
 a
 crib.


>> Do
 you
 find
 that
 your
 woodworking,
 your


acting,
 and
 your
 writing
 kind
 of
 feed


each
 other?
 It
 sounds
 like
 in
 that


example
 like
 the
 woodworking
 kind
 of
 fed


your
 acting
 in
 some
 ways
 and
 vice
 versa.


>> I
 think
 so.
 I
 I
 think
 that
 more
 it's


more
 just
 on
 a
 disciplinary
 level
 like


they
 all
 feed
 into
 each
 other.
 The
 work


and
 planning
 and
 forethought
 that
 I
 put


into
 something
 in
 the
 wood
 shop
 gives
 me


patience
 and
 the
 wherewithal
 to
 also


like
 ah
 right
 I
 should
 sharpen
 things


for
 my
 acting
 job
 or
 my
 tour
 as
 a


humorist
 and
 I
 should
 also
 understand


that
 I'm
 going
 to
 make
 some
 mistakes
 you


know
 and
 all
 of
 these
 lessons
 and
 I
 get


them
 from
 my
 mom
 and
 dad
 and
 from
 Wendel


Barry
 and
 and
 also
 you
 know
 Zen
 Cohen's


like
 the
 way
 of
 the
 art
 is
 the
 way
 of


the
 Buddha.


which
 will
 always
 move
 me
 and
 to
 always


maintain
 the
 attitude
 of
 a
 student.
 You


know,
 that
 all
 means
 like
 we
 all
 have
 a


gift
 within
 us.
 It's
 our
 responsibility


to
 figure
 out
 what
 that
 is
 and
 then


that's
 how
 we
 make
 our
 life
 fulfilling


is
 by
 performing
 that
 that
 service
 for


others.
 For
 me,
 it's
 making
 stuff
 out
 of


wood
 or
 making
 funny
 faces
 as
 I
 fall


down.


Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a
 quick
 break


and
 when
 we
 come
 back,
 we'll
 chat
 with


Nick
 about
 his
 favorite
 tools
 of
 all


time.
 Be
 right
 back.


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 So
 Nick,
 this
 is
 the
 Wire


Cutter
 show.
 We
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 the


tools
 that
 you
 use.
 So
 hypothetically,


let's
 say
 someone
 really
 wants
 to
 get


into
 tools,
 but
 they
 don't
 even
 know


where
 to
 start.
 At
 Wire
 Cutter,
 we


rarely
 recommend
 like
 pre-made
 tool
 kits


where
 you
 can
 just
 buy
 them
 basically


off
 the
 rack,
 you
 know,
 at
 Home
 Depot
 or


whatever.
 So,
 we
 were
 wondering
 what


five
 tools
 you
 would
 recommend
 or
 range


in
 your
 own
 personal
 bag
 for
 a
 newbie.


And
 is
 is
 this
 just
 for
 someone's
 like


household
 first
 five
 tools?


>> Let's
 start
 there.
 Yeah.


>> First
 and
 foremost,
 these
 days
 I
 go
 for


uh
 for
 a
 nice
 cordless
 drill.


>> She's
 laughing
 because
 I
 very
 very


intentionally
 went
 out
 and
 bought
 a


drill
 so
 that
 I
 could
 be
 a
 bit
 more


self-sufficient.
 And
 I
 was
 suckered
 into


buying
 a
 corded
 drill
 because
 the
 person


at
 the
 store
 told
 me
 that
 that
 was
 the


one
 to
 get.
 and
 I
 assumed
 that
 was
 the


right
 thing
 and
 I've
 been
 dragged
 ever


since.


>> Well,
 I
 will
 not
 shame
 you.


>> Thank
 you,
 Nick.


>> Um,
 you
 you
 can
 get
 a
 lot
 done
 with
 a


corded
 drill.
 Uh,
 especially
 if
 you
 have


an
 extension
 cord.


>> Yeah.
 Or
 you're
 just
 close
 to
 the
 the


plug,
 right?
 It's
 absurd.


>> It
 just
 cracks
 me
 up
 thinking
 that
 you


have
 to
 plug
 it
 in
 to
 do
 anything
 in


your
 house.


>> It's
 absurd.


>> It's
 funny
 to
 me
 that
 you
 think
 that's


funny
 where
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 of
 course


that's
 how
 we
 did
 it
 for
 a
 really
 long


time.


>> I
 know.
 No,
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 it's
 just


it's,
 you
 know,
 she
 can
 get
 a
 cordless


>> dr.
 No,
 I
 get
 it.
 I
 get
 it.
 I
 mean,
 we


used
 to
 to
 make
 a
 phone
 call,
 you
 used


to
 have
 to
 move
 your
 body
 to
 a
 place


where
 a
 phone
 was
 on
 a
 wall


>> before
 my
 time,
 Nick.


>> And
 then
 you
 had
 to
 stay
 there
 the
 whole


time.
 Yeah.
 You
 couldn't
 leave
 the


phone.
 Um,
 but
 those
 they're
 incredible


because
 especially
 nowadays,
 you
 can
 get


a
 kit
 with
 all
 the
 different
 bits
 and
 a


nice
 set
 of
 drill
 bits.
 So,
 you
 can
 get


a
 lot
 done
 with
 those.
 That's
 one.


Number
 two
 is
 I
 also
 would
 get
 a
 nice


manual
 screwdriver
 with
 interchangeable


bits
 cuz
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 applications


that
 a
 drill
 doesn't
 fit
 into
 or
 that
 a


drill
 is
 maybe
 too
 much
 for.
 Number


three
 is
 a
 nice
 socket
 set.


>> What's
 that?
 It's
 a
 set
 of
 little
 uh


cylinders
 that
 fit
 on
 nuts
 and
 bolts,


hexagonal
 nuts
 and
 bolts,


>> and
 it
 comes
 with
 a
 ratchet.


>> So,


>> Got
 it.


>> So,
 that
 in
 combination
 with
 a
 wrench


set
 or
 a
 crescent
 wrench
 that's
 an


adjustable
 wrench


>> that
 kind
 of
 equips
 you
 to
 put
 together


and
 take
 apart
 all
 nuts
 and
 bolts
 that


are
 in
 the
 in
 the
 hexagonal
 family,


which
 used
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 the
 only
 game


in
 town.
 Nowadays,
 they
 have
 all
 kinds


of
 different
 fasteners.
 That
 complicates


things
 where
 if
 you
 have
 to
 have
 more


than
 two
 or
 three
 kinds
 of
 screw
 tip,


especially
 if
 you're
 taking
 things
 apart


and
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 tip
 they


use,
 they
 have
 square
 tips
 and
 phips


tips.


>> So,
 this
 is
 like
 comparable
 to
 like
 when


iPhone
 kept
 changing
 the
 charging
 ports


on
 everything
 and
 now
 we're
 all
 going


back
 to
 like
 universal
 and
 we
 could
 have


just
 done
 that
 forever.


>> How
 could
 Yeah.
 And
 how
 is
 that
 even
 I


don't
 like
 that
 about
 capitalism
 that


that


even
 that
 the
 nations
 are
 allowed
 to
 go


imperial
 or
 metric.
 I'm
 like
 come
 on


guys
 we're
 we're
 sharing
 this
 planet


along.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 What
 are
 we
 on?
 Three
 or
 four.


>> Well,
 if
 the
 socket
 set
 is
 three
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 a
 set
 of
 wrenches
 and
 that


includes
 your
 box
 end,
 your
 open
 end,


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 include
 a
 crescent


wrench
 in
 that
 as
 a
 set
 of
 wrenches.
 I


think
 you're
 cheating.
 You're
 including


sets.


>> I
 don't
 call
 it
 cheating.


You
 got
 to
 have
 a
 hammer.
 You
 have
 to


have
 a
 persuader
 and
 then
 a
 saw.
 I
 mean,


those


but
 but
 I've
 gone
 over
 five.


>> You
 like
 an
 Estwing?
 Is
 that
 what
 you


like?


>> I
 do.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 in
 my
 day,


Estwing
 really
 just
 nailed
 the
 uh
 they


were
 like
 the
 Nike
 of
 the
 available


hammer
 brands.
 They
 feel
 great.
 They


look
 great.
 Is
 there
 something
 in
 your


workshop
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 an
 unsung
 hero?


It's
 not
 the
 obvious
 tool.
 It's
 not
 the


thing
 that
 everybody
 has
 in
 their


toolbox,
 but
 it's
 something
 that
 you


think
 deserves
 more
 attention
 than
 it


gets.


>> The
 thing
 that
 springs
 to
 mind
 is


there's
 a
 company
 in
 Maine
 called
 Lee


Nielsen
 Hand
 Planes.
 They
 make
 hand


planes
 and
 uh
 chisels
 and
 a
 few
 other


implements
 of
 fine
 woodworking.
 Their


tools
 are
 just
 exquisite.
 there's
 a


little
 uh
 hand
 plane
 that's
 that's
 all


in
 brass
 that
 fits
 neatly
 into
 like
 your


apron
 pocket.
 So
 that's
 what
 springs
 to


mind
 is
 invariably
 in
 my
 co-author
 of


this
 book,
 Lee,
 who
 ran
 my
 shop
 for
 10


years,
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 how


it's
 like
 your
 dependable
 Swiss
 Army


knife
 where
 there
 are
 so
 many
 other


shavings
 or
 adjustments
 that
 you
 want
 to


make
 to
 a
 piece,
 but
 you've
 always
 got


that
 that
 little
 Lee
 Nielsen
 plane.


[Music]


Nick,
 you
 don't
 have
 kids,
 but
 you


collaborated
 with
 Lee
 Buchanan,
 who
 is


the
 co-author
 of
 this
 book.
 Yeah.


>> I
 want
 to
 hear
 about
 how
 you
 went
 about


deciding
 on
 the
 projects,
 and
 what
 did


you
 learn
 from
 Lee
 as
 you
 were
 creating


this
 book?


>> When
 Parks
 and
 Wreck
 looked
 like
 it
 was


going
 to
 go,


I
 thought,
 I
 think
 my
 life
 is
 going
 to


change.
 I
 think
 if
 this
 is
 anything
 like


it
 seems,
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 less


time
 in
 the
 shop.
 And
 so
 I
 either
 need


to
 like
 lock
 up
 the
 shop
 or
 get
 somebody


working
 here
 under
 the
 opaces
 of
 offer


wood
 shop.
 And
 a
 mutual
 friend
 of
 ours
 I


was
 working
 with
 and
 he
 said
 you
 know
 I


just
 did
 an
 install
 and
 this
 woman
 named


Lee
 outworked
 the
 other
 three
 guys.
 Uh
 I


just
 met
 her
 and
 you
 should
 you
 should


meet
 her.
 She's
 pretty
 special.
 So
 I
 had


her
 in
 for
 a
 meeting.
 Everything
 about


her
 was
 so
 wonderful.
 So
 together
 we


sort
 of
 built
 this
 family
 over
 the


years.
 We
 ended
 up
 doing
 a
 woodworking


book
 for
 adults
 and
 everybody
 called


Good
 Clean
 Fun
 and
 it's
 been
 so
 much
 fun


to
 get
 to
 collaborate
 with
 her
 again.


When
 we're
 together,
 we
 come
 up
 with
 all


of
 the
 ideas
 for
 what
 the
 projects
 will


be.
 Some
 of
 them
 were
 no-brainers
 and


some
 of
 them
 we
 kind
 of
 workshopped


where
 we
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 what
 bench


design,
 what
 saworse
 design,
 what


materials,
 you
 know,
 we
 workshopped
 a


few
 different
 connectors
 for
 the
 box


kite,
 for example.
 And
 Lee's
 just
 so


great,
 whether
 she
 was
 running
 my
 shop


or
 doing
 this
 from
 afar,
 working
 in
 her


shop
 in
 Berkeley,
 she's
 just
 amazing."


>> How
 did
 you
 decide
 what
 would
 be


appropriate
 for
 kids?
 Were
 you
 really


leaning
 on
 Lee
 to
 kind
 of
 be
 like,
 "Hey,


you've
 got
 some
 kids.
 Is
 this


appropriate?"
 Or
 were
 you
 testing
 it
 out


with
 kids
 in
 the
 shop?


>> It
 had
 mainly
 to
 do
 with
 what
 you
 could


make
 satisfyingly
 with
 hand
 tools.
 We


were
 trying
 to
 limit
 most
 of
 the


projects
 to
 not
 needing
 power
 tools.


There
 aren't
 a
 lot
 of
 projects
 that
 are


meant
 to
 send
 your
 kids
 off
 like
 go
 out


in
 the
 garage
 and
 and
 whip
 up
 a
 couple


saw
 horses.
 They're
 generally
 meant
 to


have
 adult
 supervision
 just
 because
 in


the
 wood
 shop,
 you
 know,
 just
 like
 in


the
 kitchen,
 there
 are
 implements
 that


are
 sharp
 that
 you
 can
 really
 hurt


yourself
 with.
 And
 so,
 no
 matter
 what


age
 we
 are,
 when
 anybody
 comes
 into
 my


shop,
 I'm
 like,
 okay,
 always
 a
 lot
 of


grab
 ass
 here.
 And
 like
 we
 love
 having


fun,
 but
 number
 one
 is
 straight
 up
 like


safety
 first.
 That
 will
 kill
 you.


That'll
 chop
 your
 hand
 off.
 We
 wear


hearing
 protection
 and
 protect
 our
 eyes.


We
 protect
 our
 lungs.
 And
 we're
 dead


serious.
 Like
 don't
 if
 somebody's
 using


a
 tool,
 pretend
 that
 they're
 backing
 a


bulldozer
 toward
 you.
 Just
 give
 them


respect.
 And
 so
 with
 kids
 as
 well,
 we


just
 went
 through
 each
 project
 idea.
 And


you
 know,
 there
 were
 all
 kinds
 of


different
 toys
 and
 games
 and
 and
 fun


things.
 And
 maybe
 the
 most
 benign
 thing


I
 can
 think
 of
 in
 the
 book,
 there
 are


two
 sets
 of
 tongs
 that
 we
 make.
 One
 of


them
 are
 are
 these,
 we
 call
 them
 toast


tongs.
 And
 you
 can
 imagine
 a
 couple
 of


big
 tongue
 depressors
 and
 you
 glue
 a


little
 piece
 of
 wood
 between
 one
 end
 of


those.
 And
 you
 can
 make
 it's
 a
 big
 pair


of
 tweezers.
 And
 it's
 really
 fun.
 One
 of


the
 first
 things
 you
 can
 learn
 in


woodworking
 is
 when
 you
 glue
 wood


together,
 how
 strong
 that
 is.
 It's
 so


exciting.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 make
 whole


pieces
 of
 furniture
 just
 relying
 on
 the


strength
 of
 the
 wood
 glued
 together.
 And


so
 the
 tongs
 is
 such
 a
 handy
 implement.


And
 that
 to
 me,
 everything
 that
 we
 make


in
 the
 shop,
 once
 its
 use
 comes
 into


play,
 like
 you
 let
 the
 glue
 dry,
 you


sand
 it
 a
 little
 bit,
 and
 then
 you
 can


pull
 your
 toast
 out
 of
 the
 toaster
 or


you
 can
 take
 these
 tongs
 and
 flip
 your


hot
 dog
 on
 the
 grill
 and
 it
 just
 feels


incredible.
 Like,
 holy
 cow,
 I
 made
 this


just
 by
 gluing
 these
 pieces
 of
 wood


together.
 And
 so
 we
 sort
 of
 extrapolate


off
 of
 that,
 you
 know,
 using
 a
 a
 set
 of


hand
 tools.
 We
 kind
 of
 discerned,
 okay,


most
 of
 what
 we
 did.
 We
 made
 some
 of


them
 together,
 Lee
 and
 I,
 cuz
 we
 did


have
 some
 times
 together
 up
 in
 her
 shop,


but
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 she
 also


prototyped
 with
 her
 kids,
 and
 she
 would


go
 through
 and
 see
 what
 they
 could
 do


and
 what
 they
 couldn't
 do.


[Music]


Nick,
 we
 usually
 ask
 all
 of
 our
 guests


one
 final
 question,
 which
 is,
 what's
 the


last
 thing
 you
 bought
 that
 you've
 really


loved?
 But
 we
 want
 to
 ask
 you,
 what's


the
 last
 thing
 that
 you've
 built
 that


you've
 really
 loved?


>> That
 is
 a
 great
 question.
 There
 there


are
 a
 couple
 things
 that
 I
 made
 for


Megan
 uh
 that
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say.
 Um,


one
 of
 them
 is
 a
 sex
 toy,
 but


that's
 all
 I'm
 going
 to
 say.


And
 if
 you
 are
 making
 a
 sex
 toy,
 just


make
 sure
 if
 you
 think
 you've
 sanded
 it


enough,
 sand
 it
 just
 a
 little
 more.


The
 last
 thing
 I
 made
 that
 I
 really


loved
 are
 this
 batch
 of
 ukuleles,
 which


I've
 been
 working
 on
 bit
 by
 bit
 for


years.
 When
 you
 play
 a
 an
 instrument


that
 you've
 made
 and
 people
 don't
 leave,


it
 feels
 pretty
 incredible.
 One
 day
 I


will
 wield
 that
 in
 concert


and
 then
 I
 can
 retire.


Well,
 thank
 you,
 Nick.
 It's
 been
 a


pleasure.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> You're
 very
 patient.
 Thanks
 for
 putting


up
 with
 me.


>> Very
 fun.


>> Nick
 Offerman's

>> So,
 when
 you're
 making
 sex
 toys,
 uh,


first
 of
 all,
 just
 don't
 even
 use


conifers.
 Like,
 don't
 avoid
 soft
 woods


altogether.
 Go
 with
 deciduous
 hardwoods.


And
 just
 don't
 forget
 to
 raise
 the


grain.
