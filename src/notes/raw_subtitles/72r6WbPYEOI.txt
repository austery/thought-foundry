All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


It
 is
 the
 last
 day
 of
 October
 and
 we
 are


ending
 out
 the
 month
 of
 October.
 Two


months
 left
 of
 the
 year
 and
 it
 looks


like
 folks
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 a
 green


close
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 We
 got
 a
 lot


to
 talk
 about.
 Lots
 of
 headlines
 since


we
 were
 live
 on
 the
 market
 open.
 If
 you


take
 a
 look
 right
 here
 at
 the
 S&P
 500
 up


about
 half
 a
 percent
 on
 the
 day
 which
 is


not
 too
 bad.
 68405.
 It
 looks
 like


Palanteer
 will
 give
 us
 the
 $200
 close.


We
 got
 13
 minutes
 left.
 Hopefully
 we
 get


that
 close
 above
 200.
 We
 did
 dip
 all
 the


way to
 197.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 coming


back
 above
 200
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.


Robin
 Hood
 dipped
 to
 43,
 back
 to
 147.


Not
 too
 bad.
 Google
 relatively
 flat
 on


the
 day
 at
 281.
 AMD's
 up
 1%.
 SoFi
 is
 up


1.5.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 flat
 day


since
 the
 market
 open.
 Amazon
 246
 did


lose
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love,
 but
 still


holding
 that
 10%
 move,
 which
 is


incredible
 for
 a
 hyperscaler.
 Now,
 Meta,


they
 are
 absolutely
 taking
 to
 town.
 I


did
 not
 buy
 more
 Meta.
 649
 down
 2.48%
 on


the
 day.
 They
 put
 it
 at
 645
 at
 one


point.
 I
 didn't
 think
 they
 would
 let
 it


break
 650.
 It
 seems
 like
 there
 is
 a
 deep


structural
 concern
 about
 capex
 and
 we'll


talk
 more
 about
 Meta
 and
 it
 has
 to
 go


deeper
 than
 the
 surface
 level
 concerns


if
 the
 street
 is
 this
 scared
 on
 a
 green


day
 on
 the
 last
 day
 of
 the
 month
 for


Meta.
 Now
 you
 probably
 have
 a
 lot
 of


options
 that
 are
 expiring
 today
 as
 well.


So
 it
 could
 just
 be
 ALOS
 but
 uh
 Meta


right
 here
 649
 that
 one
 is
 down
 another


2%
 of
 the
 day.
 Bitcoin
 will
 end
 red
 for


October.
 I
 mean
 we
 do
 have
 um
 what
 nine


10
 more
 hours
 in
 the
 day.
 So
 maybe


Bitcoin,
 if
 it
 gets
 a
 $5,000
 candle,


will
 be
 able
 to
 hold
 up,
 but
 if
 it
 does


go
 red,
 it
 will
 be
 the
 first
 red


October,
 not
 really
 October
 for
 Bitcoin,


uh,
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 six
 years.
 So,


it's
 one
 thing
 to
 look
 out
 for.
 We
 do


have
 about
 nine
 more
 hours
 to
 see
 how


Bitcoin
 closes.
 Ethereum
 right
 there
 at


3,800.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 BMR
 right
 now
 at


4667,
 up
 about
 4.7%
 on
 the
 day.
 So,


look,
 I
 mean,
 overall,
 it's
 been
 an


incredible
 month.
 It's
 been
 a
 wild


month.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things


happen
 this
 month,
 this
 entire
 week
 with


the
 Fed
 cuts,
 big
 tech
 earnings,
 etc.


has
 been
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 but
 I
 do
 think


it
 has
 been
 a
 strong
 month
 for
 the
 stock


market,
 if
 we
 do
 end
 green
 today,
 which


it
 looks
 like
 we
 will,
 it'll
 be
 six


months
 of
 green
 in
 a
 row.
 The
 resiliency


of
 the
 market
 is
 something
 to
 be


commended.
 And
 those
 who
 bought
 the
 dip


when
 it
 was
 time
 to
 buy
 the
 dip,
 whether


it
 was
 October
 10th
 or
 October
 17th,


variety
 of
 days
 this
 month
 that


definitely
 test
 the
 conviction,
 uh,
 you


are
 being
 rewarded.
 And
 we
 got
 an
 Elon


and
 Rogan
 podcast
 for
 Halloween.
 Here's


Elon
 talking
 about
 flying
 cars.
 of
 the


the
 future
 was
 supposed
 to
 have
 flying


cars,
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 flying
 cars.


>> So,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fly?


>> Well,
 I
 mean,


uh,


I
 think
 if
 Peter
 wants
 a
 flying
 car,
 we


should
 should
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 one.


>> He's
 talking
 about
 Peter
 Teal.


>> So,
 you
 are
 you
 actively
 considering


making
 an
 electric
 flying
 car?
 Is
 this


like
 a
 real
 thing?


>> Well,
 I
 have
 to
 see
 in
 the


>> in
 the
 demo.
 So
 when
 you
 do
 this,
 like


are
 are
 you
 going
 to
 have
 a
 retractable


wing?
 Like
 what
 is
 the
 idea
 behind
 this?


>> Don't
 be
 sly.
 Come
 on.


>> I
 I
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 uh
 do
 the
 unveil


before
 the
 unveil.
 Um
 but
 um


>> tell
 me
 off
 air
 then.
 I
 I
 I
 it
 h
 look
 I


I
 think
 it
 has
 a
 shot
 at
 being
 the
 most


memorable


um
 product
 unveil


ever.


It
 has
 a
 shot.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 Some
 uh
 nice
 threeh


hour
 Halloween
 action
 with
 Mr.
 Joe
 Rogan


and
 Elon
 Musk.
 I
 mean
 there's
 been


rumors
 of
 this
 flying
 car
 roadster


collaboration
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So
 Elon


kind
 of
 just
 bringing
 those
 back
 and
 who


knows
 maybe
 we
 get
 that
 going
 into
 the


next
 five
 years.
 AMD
 right
 there
 up


about
 1.28%.
 Where
 is
 the
 lab
 of


rockets?
 Rocket
 Lab
 right
 here
 62.99


that's
 up
 about
 3.37%.
 Coinbase
 348.


Coinbase
 had
 a
 great
 day
 as
 well.
 Wells


was
 up
 9%
 now
 up
 6%.
 Cory
 up
 2.5.
 Nebius


are
 we
 still
 holding
 130?
 We
 are
 131.


Not
 bad
 on
 Nebus.
 Congratulations.
 Nice


to
 see
 that.
 Went
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


94.
 Speaks
 to
 the
 resiliency
 of
 that


data
 center
 play
 in
 particular.
 And


that's
 why
 NeAs
 is
 getting
 some
 love


right
 there.
 Delta
 at
 57.
 You
 got
 DLO


down
 about
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 then
 Cisco


basically
 flat.
 S&P
 500
 at
 62.
 We
 did


have
 Tom
 Leon.
 Uh
 he
 was
 in
 the
 Middle


East
 traveling
 this
 entire
 week,
 which


is
 why
 we
 didn't
 hear
 too
 much
 from
 him.


But
 here
 is
 what
 he
 just
 said
 about
 30


minutes
 ago
 on
 what
 is
 the
 state
 of
 this


bull
 market
 and
 why
 he
 continues
 to
 be


bullish
 on
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.


>> Great
 to
 see
 you,
 Scott.
 I'm
 going
 to


take
 issue
 like
 I
 did
 last
 time
 with
 an


a
 comment
 that
 you
 gave
 to
 our


producers.
 Tom,
 you
 think
 it's
 still
 the


quote
 most
 hated
 rally?
 I
 I
 just
 don't


know
 how
 that
 still
 holds
 water


given
 where
 we
 are.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I


interview
 people
 all
 day
 every
 day.
 I've


got
 no
 bears
 around.


>> Well,
 um
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 some
 of
 the
 bears


have
 gone
 to
 hiding,
 Scott,
 but
 because


the
 last
 time
 we
 talked,
 I
 wanted
 to


give
 you
 some
 quantitative
 stats.
 Um,
 if


you
 take
 AAI,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 one
 of


the
 best
 surveys
 of
 high
 netw
 worth


retail
 investors,
 it's
 averaged
 -
 11.7


this
 year,
 negative
 11.7.
 There
 have


only
 been
 three
 other
 times
 in
 that


survey's
 35-year
 history
 where
 the


year-to-
 date
 average
 has
 been
 negative.


It
 was
 1990,


2002,


and
 2022.


So
 um
 all
 those
 times
 have
 actually
 been


associated
 with
 bare
 markets
 and
 so


sentiment
 has
 averaged
 this
 year
 what's


consistent
 with
 a
 bare
 market.
 So
 it
 is


the
 most
 hated
 V-shaped
 rally.
 Now
 there


may
 be
 some
 people
 who
 say
 they're
 no


longer
 bearish
 but
 their
 P&L
 doesn't


reflect
 that.


>> No,
 that
 that
 that
 that
 may
 be
 fair.
 Um,


which
 leads
 us
 to
 the
 potential
 of
 a


chase
 into
 year
 end
 when
 they
 realize


that
 what's
 at
 stake
 for
 them
 if
 they're


not
 engaged.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 we
 know
 80%
 of
 fund


managers
 are
 trailing
 their
 respective


benchmark
 this
 year.
 It's
 the
 worst
 in


almost
 25
 years.
 So,
 uh,
 and
 now
 they're


given
 two
 things
 to
 work
 with.
 One
 is


that
 seasonally
 November's
 a
 good
 month,


so
 it
 should
 be
 a
 positive
 month.
 And
 as


far
 as
 earnings
 go
 and
 and
 you
 guys
 had


a
 conversation
 about
 it
 um
 earlier


today,
 margins
 have
 been
 improving


despite
 tariffs.
 And
 so
 it's
 showing
 you


that
 companies,
 I
 think,
 using
 AI
 are


able
 to
 expand
 profit
 margins.
 That's


actually
 a
 a
 pretty
 good
 tailwind


because
 the
 tariff
 headwinds
 are
 fading,


but
 the
 benefits
 from
 AI
 margin
 benefits


are
 still
 going
 to
 grow.


Now,
 I'm
 a
 little
 surprised,
 maybe
 not


much,
 but
 just
 because
 you
 have
 a


history
 of
 of
 liking
 small
 caps
 o
 over


the
 last
 year
 or
 so,
 but
 particularly


coming
 off
 the
 Fed
 meeting
 where
 the
 Fed


chair
 went
 out
 of
 his
 way
 to
 say
 that


December
 is
 not
 a
 foregone
 conclusion


and
 then
 underscored
 that
 with
 far
 from


it,
 which
 obviously
 if
 rates
 aren't


going
 to
 go
 down
 in
 the
 trajectory
 that


you
 probably
 thought
 they
 would,
 then


small
 caps
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 perform


the
 way
 you
 thought
 they
 might.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 one
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 is


that,
 you
 know, if
 you
 look
 at
 Fed
 fund


futures,
 it's
 still
 projecting
 a
 cut
 in


December.
 I
 think
 Fed
 Chair
 Powell
 in


his
 statements
 did
 give
 you
 a
 window
 for


why
 it's
 possible.
 One
 is
 he
 did


acknowledge
 that
 inflation's
 effect
 from


tariffs
 is
 less
 than
 they
 expected.
 And


despite
 a
 lot
 of
 Fed
 governors
 talking


about
 inflation
 widening,
 that's
 not
 the


case.
 Um
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 CPI


report
 in
 September,
 it
 was
 the
 highest


percentage
 of
 components,
 54%
 that
 were


in
 outright
 deflation.
 So
 it's
 it's
 in


fact
 inflation
 is
 falling
 like
 a
 rock.


And
 the
 second
 was
 he
 acknowledged
 that


rates
 aren't
 accommodative.
 They're
 just


less
 restrictive.
 And
 so
 in
 a
 case
 where


there's
 falling
 inflation
 and
 if
 if
 jobs


markets
 weakening,


I
 think
 that
 that's
 a
 good
 reason
 for


cuts
 to
 happen.
 And
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 good


for
 equities.


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 mean,
 we
 were
 talking
 about


December
 probabilities,
 Tom,
 before
 the


meeting
 at
 like
 100%.
 Now
 they're
 down


and
 some
 like,
 you
 know,
 Jeffrey


Gunlock,
 who
 I
 interviewed
 the
 other
 day


post
 Powell
 was
 like
 could
 be
 50/50.
 So


maybe
 the
 that
 particular
 trade
 gets


paralyzed,
 if
 you
 will,
 between
 now
 and


the
 next
 meeting
 because
 we
 just
 need
 to


see
 what
 the
 Fed's
 going
 to
 do
 before
 we


become
 big
 believers
 in
 the
 small
 caps.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 something


that
 the
 Fed
 won't
 will
 not
 want
 to
 do,


which
 is
 be
 a
 little
 forward-looking.


But
 we
 have
 a
 government
 shutdown
 that's


continuing
 that
 is
 causing
 even
 things


like
 air
 traffic
 to
 slow
 and
 inflation


isn't
 going
 to
 be
 gaining
 strength
 in
 a


period
 like
 that.
 So,
 if
 the
 Fed
 was


acknowledging
 inflation's
 weakening
 now,


I
 think
 it's
 even
 weaker
 in
 December
 at


a
 time
 when
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 is


suffering.
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 if
 those
 if


someone
 thinks
 the
 odds
 have
 dropped


because
 of
 what
 the
 Fed
 said,
 I
 just


think
 the
 data
 would
 support
 a
 very


opposite
 picture.


>> And
 you
 still
 like
 7,000
 at
 least


between
 now
 and
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 I


mean,
 we
 closed
 above
 6,900
 the
 other


day.
 So,
 we're
 well
 on
 our
 way,
 it
 would


appear.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 And
 uh
 but
 it


probably
 makes
 sense
 for
 people
 to
 be


aware
 that
 because
 October
 was
 so


strong,
 we
 we
 have
 to
 consolidate
 some


of
 those
 gains
 in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the


of
 November.
 And
 Mark
 Newton,
 our


technician,
 does
 think
 it's
 it
 that


we're
 going
 to
 be
 entering
 a
 period
 of


chop.
 So
 7,000,
 yes,
 makes
 sense.
 And


it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 bumpy
 in
 the
 next


couple
 weeks.


>> Hey
 Tom,
 have
 a


>> So
 look,
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 Tom
 said
 right


there
 I
 think
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 We


got
 four
 minutes
 until
 the
 market


closes.
 Number
 one,
 I
 think
 the
 Fed
 is


trying
 to
 just
 get
 the
 market
 to
 not
 be


over
 excited
 for
 a
 December
 rate
 cut.


But
 the
 number
 one
 reason,
 which
 I


1,000%
 agree
 with
 on
 Tom,
 on
 why
 we


would
 get
 that
 rate
 cut,
 uh,
 is
 that
 we


have
 a
 government
 shutdown
 and
 we
 have
 a


weak
 labor
 market.
 And
 naturally,
 if
 the


fear
 on
 a
 December
 rate
 cut
 is
 that
 we


have
 inflation
 because
 of
 tariffs,
 well,


if
 we
 have
 a
 labor
 market
 slowdown
 and


we
 have
 a
 government
 shutdown
 in
 which


people
 aren't
 getting
 paid,
 guess
 what?


If
 people
 aren't
 getting
 paid
 as
 much,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 consume,


which
 will
 naturally
 be
 deflationary.
 So


from
 that
 perspective,
 I
 think
 it
 is


very
 unlikely
 that
 we
 don't
 get
 a


December
 cut.
 I
 mean,
 something
 would


have
 to
 change
 in
 the
 macro
 in
 a


meaningful
 way
 uh
 for
 that
 to
 take


place.
 So
 I
 think
 we're
 going to
 get


that
 rate
 cut,
 which
 is
 why
 he's


bullish.
 And
 then
 number
 two,
 the
 AI


investor
 survey
 that
 he
 talks
 about
 is


legit.
 I
 mean,
 I
 looked
 at
 the
 stats
 he


was
 looking
 at
 and
 the
 last
 three
 times


we
 had
 uh
 the
 investor
 sentiment
 be
 as


skewed
 as
 it
 is
 to
 the
 bearish
 side,


we're
 in
 bare
 markets.
 We
 are
 obviously


not
 in
 a
 bare
 market,
 but
 the
 fact
 that


people
 are
 acting
 like
 we
 are
 through


that
 investor
 survey
 and
 if
 you
 don't


even
 want
 to
 look
 at
 that
 investor


survey,
 just
 look
 at
 what
 Mr.
 Michael


Bur
 posted
 yesterday
 essentially


claiming
 that
 this
 is
 a
 bubble.
 And
 so


when
 you've
 got
 that
 level
 of
 excitement


on
 wanting
 to
 call
 that
 it's
 toppy,
 it's


bubbish,
 etc.
 by
 ignoring
 the
 earnings


growth
 that
 we
 have
 seen
 all
 week,


Amazon
 just
 growing
 AWS
 at
 20%.
 I
 think


that's
 actually
 very
 productive
 for
 the


bull
 case
 because
 it
 means
 there
 is


enough
 healthy
 skepticism
 that's
 out


there
 to
 go
 higher.
 And
 so
 I
 don't
 think


anything
 Google,
 Microsoft
 Meta,
 Amazon


or
 Apple
 said
 today
 was
 or
 said
 over
 the


past
 week
 was
 bearish
 and
 as
 a
 result


you
 likely
 have
 this
 bull
 market
 that


has
 a
 chance
 to
 continue.
 Google
 right


there
 at
 281.
 BMR
 right
 here
 4664.
 So


that's
 up
 about
 1.84%.
 Microsoft
 down


1.5.
 Microsoft
 did
 get
 hit
 today.
 Uh


they
 did
 take
 that
 open
 AI
 $3
 billion


loss
 and
 the
 street
 likely
 is
 punishing


them
 for
 that
 but
 the
 overall
 quarter


was
 not
 that
 bad.
 Micro
 strategy
 right


here
 up
 5.86%
 as
 up
 4.6.
 HIMS
 up
 3.2
 and


then
 Uber
 basically
 up2%


on
 the
 day.
 Uh
 we
 got
 about
 two
 minutes


until
 this
 market
 closes.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 if
 Palanteer
 can
 get
 that
 $200


close.
 We
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 headlines


that
 we
 got
 to
 talk
 about.
 Grab
 earnings


is
 on
 Monday.
 There's
 actually
 a
 new


interview
 that
 came
 out
 with
 the
 COO
 of


Grab.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 I
 just
 want
 to
 share
 one


clip
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 where
 he
 talks


about
 Grab
 as
 an
 AI
 company
 that
 I


thought
 was
 a
 really
 important
 thing
 to


think
 about.
 And
 so
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at


that
 and
 then
 we'll
 preview
 what
 we've


got
 going
 on
 into
 next
 week
 as
 we


officially
 end
 out
 the
 month
 of
 October.


Been
 a
 wild
 week.
 Nvidia
 going
 a
 little


red.
 Nvidia
 crossed
 200
 for
 the
 first


time.
 Got
 to
 a
 five
 trillion
 dollar


company
 in
 the
 month
 of
 October.
 We
 had


a
 lot
 of
 different
 headlines,
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 that
 happened.
 We
 had
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 China
 stuff.
 I
 mean,


we
 kind
 of
 got
 a
 China
 deal.
 Kind
 of


don't.
 Bassen
 did
 give
 some
 comments


today
 to
 the
 Financial
 Times
 and
 said,


"Hey,
 I
 think
 the
 Chinese
 were
 very


alarmed
 by
 the
 global
 backlash
 to
 their


export
 controls,
 which
 is
 why
 they
 were


able
 to
 negotiate
 with
 us
 and
 create


some
 type
 of
 meaningful
 deal.
 Hopefully


by
 the
 end
 of the
 year,
 if
 we
 get
 China


and
 India
 confirmed,
 uh,
 that
 would
 be


very
 exciting.
 And
 maybe
 that
 allows
 us


to
 end
 out
 this
 bull
 market
 with
 a


pretty
 decent
 run."
 All
 right,
 folks.


Here
 we
 go.
 Happy
 Halloween
 to
 everybody


again.
 Thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 here.


Thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 here
 this
 entire


week.
 Uh
 it's
 been
 an
 incredible
 week.


Turned
 28
 this
 week.
 Was
 happy
 to


celebrate
 it
 with
 everyone
 here.
 Truly,


truly,
 truly
 am
 blessed
 and
 honored
 and


privileged
 to
 be
 in
 this
 position
 and


grateful
 to
 be
 here
 every
 single
 day.


And
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 it
 going.
 So,


thank
 you
 everybody.
 Here
 we
 go.
 It
 is


Friday,
 October
 31st.
 We
 are
 ending
 out


the
 month
 of
 October
 and
 the
 stock


market
 goes
 green
 for
 the
 sixth
 month
 in


a
 row.
 The
 markets
 are
 officially


closed.


All
 right,
 we're
 done.
 We
 survived


another
 month.
 We
 survived
 another


month.
 S&P
 selling
 off
 a
 bit
 into
 the


close.
 Palunteer
 does
 get
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 history
 the
 $200


close.
 Got
 the
 204
 at
 one
 point
 today.


200.5


on
 pound
 here.
 Grab
 got
 the
 six-star


close.
 Google
 at
 281.
 SoFi
 at
 2963.


Hoodie
 14673
 on
 the
 close.
 S&P
 500
 just


above
 680.
 AMD
 at
 256.
 Salesforce
 up


1.4,
 PayPal
 got
 to
 69
 today,
 up
 1.3,


Bitcoin
 at
 109,
 Ethereum
 at
 38.884,
 BMR


on
 the
 close,
 we
 are
 at
 4668,


uh,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 It
 was
 pushing


44
 last
 night.
 Circle
 up
 3.4%.
 App


loaning
 up
 2.6%.
 Amazon
 got
 the
 245,


244,
 just
 below
 10%,
 but
 nice
 to
 see
 it


make
 that
 move
 after
 AWS.
 Meta,
 we'll


talk
 more
 about
 that.
 Unfortunately,


Meta
 just
 really
 was
 not
 able
 to
 put
 up


the
 numbers
 that
 or
 I
 shouldn't
 say
 put


up
 the
 numbers,
 not
 able
 to
 put
 up
 the


guidance
 that
 the
 street
 wanted
 to
 see


because
 it
 was
 too
 aggressive
 on
 capex.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 Meta
 got
 hit.
 Meta


right
 there
 at
 2
 at
 648
 and
 then
 Apple


at
 271.
 Uh
 and
 then
 Microsoft
 also
 down.


Actually,
 pretty
 much
 every
 big
 tech


stock
 took
 a
 beating
 this
 week
 to
 the


downside.
 Not
 a
 massive
 beating
 um


outside
 of
 Amazon
 and
 Google.
 They
 were


the
 ones
 that
 were
 actually
 able
 to
 hold


on.
 Apple
 did
 get
 to
 those
 all-time


highs,
 but
 gave
 it
 up
 earlier
 today.


Cory
 right
 there
 2%.
 Rocklab
 3.2%.
 Dell


up.58%
 on
 the
 day.
 Irene
 we
 got
 60.99.


That
 was
 up
 4.6.
 Nebas
 did
 it
 get
 the


130
 close.
 Nebas
 did
 get
 the
 130.5


close.
 Not
 too
 bad.
 Corweed
 again
 right


there
 at
 13370


which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Archer
 right


there
 up
 2.3%.
 Verizon
 up
 1.9.
 And
 then


Dell
 161.
 SMCI
 also
 great
 recovery.


Anyone
 who
 bought
 that
 dip
 at
 47.48.


That
 one
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 that
 one


right
 here
 at
 5191.


All
 right,
 let's
 do
 it.
 Tesla
 as
 well


3.5%
 455
 even
 after
 the
 earnings.
 Tesla


was
 able
 to
 hold
 I
 mean
 Tesla
 fell
 to


418
 on
 their
 earnings
 and
 it
 was
 able
 to


keep
 moving.
 So
 Tesla
 right
 there
 with


the
 450
 close
 for
 the
 month
 of
 October.


All
 right,
 year
 to
 dates.
 Let's
 do
 it.


Let's
 get
 it
 in
 the
 chat.
 I
 know
 we
 did


a
 midweek,
 but
 we
 usually
 do
 it
 every


Friday.
 And
 let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 on


the
 year
 to
 dates.


can
 put
 that
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 into


uh
 all
 the
 other
 headlines
 we
 have.
 I


think
 we're
 gonna
 have
 a
 couple
 special


guests
 join
 us
 today
 and
 we'll
 talk
 to


them
 about
 their
 thoughts
 on
 October.


Year
 to
 date
 173.9


173.9
 for
 me.


173.9


I
 think
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 we
 were
 at


120.
 So
 decent
 recovery
 since
 the


October
 10th
 lows.
 Uh,
 but
 obviously


this
 was
 also
 a
 pretty
 good
 week.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 were
 in
 some
 stocks
 like
 a


Meta,
 that
 probably
 hurt
 your
 week.
 If


you're
 in
 a
 pounder,
 that
 probably


helped
 your
 week,
 but
 had
 a
 lot
 of


different
 stocks
 recovered.
 So,


definitely
 helping
 out
 the
 majority
 of


portfolios.
 Jake
 at
 294,
 Ikeep
 at
 163,


uh,
 Slayer
 at
 31,
 Jason
 at
 74,
 Oolie
 at


20,
 Lionus
 at
 47,
 Chris
 at
 45,
 Shane
 at


12,
 Leon
 at
 130,
 Michael
 at
 148,
 Shou
 at


500,
 uh,
 Final
 Version
 at
 43,
 023
 at
 91,


pounder
 at
 211.
 I
 mean,
 we
 are
 pretty


much
 seeing
 above
 the
 board
 around
 that


40
 to
 50%
 move
 for
 most
 people.
 Oswald


at
 67.
 Johnny
 at
 102.
 Bourbon
 time
 at


151.


It's
 not
 too
 bad.
 Jonah
 at
 60.3.
 Bro


Hizzle.
 I
 love
 that
 name.
 Bro
 Hizzle


157.8.


Chris
 Foreman
 at
 40.
 Al
 Money
 at
 129.


Draco
 at
 108.
 Callum
 at
 56.
 Golf
 Garbage


at
 158.
 King
 at
 150.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 these


are
 pretty
 incredible
 numbers
 and
 it's
 a


pretty
 good
 week
 to
 end
 out
 for
 getting


these
 numbers.
 By
 the
 way,
 S&P
 500
 for


the
 month
 to
 end
 it
 out
 officially


is
 2.38%.


2.38%


on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 It's
 a
 really
 nice


month.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 easy
 to
 get
 a
 2%


month.
 It
 almost
 went,
 you
 know,
 to
 a


negative
 4%
 month
 at
 one
 point,
 but
 the


resiliency
 of
 this
 market
 is
 quite


remarkable
 to
 see.
 Year
 to
 date,
 we're


up
 about
 17%
 over
 the
 past
 6
 months,
 23


and
 well
 over
 30%
 from
 the
 lows
 in
 April


when
 things
 hit
 the
 fan.
 Last
 says
 182.


Thank
 you
 to
 Amazon.
 Congratulations
 on


that.
 Uh
 Zoho's
 156,


Hans
 at
 300.
 Uh


Abena
 at
 710.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 these


numbers
 are
 just
 just
 incredible.
 And


you
 have
 a
 decent
 decent
 chunk
 of
 these


numbers
 well
 over
 at
 least
 17%
 which
 is


the
 S&P
 500.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.


Not
 too
 bad.
 Yeah.
 AMD
 58%
 this
 month


alone.
 I
 mean
 when
 you
 have
 names
 like


AMD
 I
 dude
 I
 forgot
 October
 AMD
 is
 when


they
 signed
 the
 uh
 this
 is
 the
 month


where
 they
 signed
 the
 opening
 eye
 deal,


right?
 Like
 same
 thing
 with
 Broadcom.
 So


you
 got
 a
 lot
 of these
 names
 if
 you're


leveraged
 into
 them
 or
 if
 you're
 just


you
 know
 heavily
 allocated
 to
 them.


these
 were
 the
 names
 that
 really
 did


outperform
 and
 that's
 where
 we're
 seeing


some
 move.
 Now,
 having
 said
 that,
 Tom


Lee
 did
 say
 at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 video


that
 uh
 Mark
 Newton,
 which
 we
 talked


about
 a
 couple
 days
 ago,
 the
 technical


analyst
 said
 uh
 November's
 going
 to
 be


choppy.
 And
 I
 kind
 of
 don't
 disagree


with
 that.
 I
 mean,
 not
 even
 from
 a


technical
 perspective,
 but
 just
 we've


had
 a
 lot
 of
 gains.
 We
 got
 to
 digest


them.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 the
 fact
 that
 we


gave
 up
 as
 many
 gains
 as
 we
 did
 back
 on


October
 10th
 and
 got
 them
 back
 and
 more,


it
 would
 be
 healthy
 to
 digest
 them,


which
 means
 a
 lot
 of these
 stocks


probably
 consolidate.
 Now,
 some
 of
 these


stocks
 have
 different
 catalyst
 like


earnings
 that
 could
 get
 them
 into
 a
 new


rerating
 of
 their
 narrative.
 But
 like
 in


Nvidia
 at
 202,
 I
 mean,
 does
 this
 go
 to


230
 next
 month
 or
 does
 this
 consolidate


maybe
 settle
 in
 around
 205,
 210?
 Is
 that


healthy?
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


question
 that
 we
 have
 to
 see
 even
 with


that
 7,000
 target
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 The
 one
 scary
 stat
 I
 told
 everyone


yesterday
 on
 crypto
 is
 that
 the
 last


time
 Bitcoin
 finished
 red
 in
 October,


which
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 to
 115,
 it
 will
 be


a
 red
 October
 for
 Bitcoin,
 we
 ended
 at


32%
 in
 November.
 Now
 granted,
 that
 was


2018.
 That
 was
 in
 one
 of
 the
 years
 of


the
 cycle.
 That
 was
 also
 or
 that
 was
 the


last
 year
 of
 the
 cycle.
 And
 um
 you
 were


also
 having
 uh
 a
 trade
 war
 happened
 with


China.
 The
 Fed
 was
 hiking
 rates.
 I
 mean,


you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 macro
 things


to
 consider.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


necessarily
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 November,


but
 those
 are
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to


watch
 out
 for
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 Yes,
 we
 looked
 at
 Elon
 and


Rogan
 speaking
 about
 the
 flying
 car.


Elon
 has
 talked
 about
 this
 before.
 I


guess
 he
 wanted
 to
 publicly
 tell


everyone
 again
 that
 there
 was
 a
 flying


car
 coming,
 but
 he's
 got
 everyone


thinking
 about
 that.
 One
 bullish
 stat


for
 Bitcoin
 is
 this.
 US
 money
 supply


rose
 4.5%
 year-over-year
 in
 September


2025
 to
 a
 record
 22.2


trillion.
 This
 is
 a
 19th
 consecutive


monthly
 increase
 that
 happens
 in
 tandem


with
 the
 United
 States
 likely
 um


stopping
 quantitative
 tightening,
 which


is
 what
 JPAL
 said
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 The


long-term
 average
 growth
 has
 been
 about


6.3%.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 at
 4.5%
 is


pretty
 incredible.
 Adjusted
 for


inflation,
 the
 M2
 supply
 grew
 1.2%


year-over-year.
 What
 does
 this
 mean?


This
 means
 you
 have
 to
 own
 assets.
 The


more
 money
 that
 is
 out
 there,
 the
 less


the
 dollar
 actually
 matters.
 Which
 means


you
 have
 to
 own
 something
 that
 preserves


the
 value
 of
 the
 dollar
 in
 the
 first


place,
 which
 has
 to
 either
 be
 a
 stock,
 a


piece
 of
 land,
 piece
 of
 property,
 uh,
 or


a
 commodity.
 You
 know,
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 buckets
 you
 can
 put
 it
 into,
 or
 a


cryptocurrency,
 and
 that's
 likely
 what


you're
 seeing
 across
 the
 entire
 equity


markets.
 The
 dollar,
 by
 the
 way,


actually
 ended
 green
 for
 the
 month.
 We


read
 97
 for
 the
 majority
 of
 October,


ended
 out
 at
 9980,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.


10-year
 was
 not
 able
 to
 close
 below
 4%


but
 we
 are
 just
 above
 that
 at
 4.095


and
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 right
 here.


Money
 market
 funds
 yesterday
 we
 took
 a


look
 at
 it
 they
 increased
 by
 20
 billion


7.42
 trillion
 still
 on
 the
 sidelines


that
 money
 still
 has
 not
 really
 flooded


into
 the
 asset
 market
 and
 if
 it
 chooses


to
 flood
 into
 the
 asset
 market
 when
 we


do
 get
 rates
 to
 come
 down
 significantly


hopefully
 towards
 the
 latter
 half
 of


2026
 that
 could
 also
 be
 an
 additional


tailwind
 for
 the
 market.
 I
 think
 the


broader
 argument
 for
 this
 bull
 market
 is


not
 even
 rooted
 in
 macro,
 not
 even


rooted
 in
 rates,
 money,
 market
 funds,


money
 on
 the
 sidelines,
 inflation.
 I


think
 it's
 really
 genuinely
 rooted
 in


earnings.
 And
 again,
 I
 I
 think
 the


number
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 focused
 on
 over


the
 past
 month
 is
 earnings.
 Are
 the


earnings
 good?
 Are
 we
 seeing
 earnings
 in


a
 way
 that's
 positive?
 The
 more
 and
 more


we
 look
 at
 it,
 the
 more
 and
 more
 it


seems
 that
 earnings
 are
 continuing
 to


propel.
 By
 the
 way,
 speaking
 of


protecting
 your
 money,
 take
 a
 look
 at


this.
 I
 didn't
 even
 see
 this
 this


morning,
 but
 Coinbase
 on
 their
 earnings


disclosed
 that
 they
 bought
 another
 100


million
 of
 Ethereum.
 So,
 they
 now
 have


617
 million
 of
 Ethereum
 on
 their


treasury.
 They
 also
 bought
 more
 Bitcoin.


The
 other
 thing
 that's
 really
 important


about
 Ethereum
 is
 that
 they
 have
 base,


which
 is
 their
 L2
 underneath
 Ethereum.


So,
 Coinbase
 is
 scaling
 their


architecture
 on
 Ethereum's
 blockchain
 as


well.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 to
 me,


I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 very
 bullish


Ethereum
 and
 BMR
 long
 term
 as
 the
 most


important
 financial
 companies
 in
 the


world.
 Whether
 it's
 Robin
 Hood
 or


Coinbase
 are
 embracing
 that
 new


financial
 system
 that
 is
 playing
 out


which
 is
 also
 nice
 to
 see.
 SoFi
 is


moving
 after
 hours.
 Is
 SoFi
 actually


moving
 or
 are
 you
 guys
 just
 saying
 it's


moving?


How
 much
 of
 a
 percentage
 move
 is
 this?


29.90
 SoFi.


Okay,
 that's
 a
 18
 cent
 move.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the
 biggest


deal
 in
 the
 world,
 but
 someone's
 buying


SoFi
 after
 hours
 to
 the
 tune
 of
 moving


it
 up
 18
 cents.
 Dude,
 look,
 SoFi
 was
 the


disappointment
 of
 this
 week.
 Obviously,


people
 were
 super
 annoyed
 that
 it
 didn't


really
 make
 the
 move
 even
 after
 it
 had
 a


a
 blockbuster
 quarter.
 And
 look,
 that


that
 that
 could
 happen
 to
 any
 stock.
 It


might
 happen
 to
 Palantry
 next
 week,


might
 happen
 to
 Grab,
 might
 happen
 to


Robin.
 It
 might
 happen
 to
 any
 of
 these


stocks.


It's
 just
 the
 nature
 of
 investing.
 like


you
 can't
 complain
 too
 much
 about
 its


year-to-day
 return
 as
 SoFi
 has
 vastly


outperformed
 the
 broader
 market.
 In


terms
 of
 the
 options
 market
 today,
 take


a
 look
 at
 the
 top
 20
 stocks
 that
 were


traded.
 Nvidia
 3.2
 million
 options


traded
 today.
 Tesla
 was
 at
 3.2,
 Amazon


2.7,
 Apple
 at
 1.6,
 Meta
 at
 1.5,
 Pounder


1.1,
 IBIT,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 AMD,


Microsoft
 Hood,
 SoFi
 at
 500,000


contracts,
 Google,
 Coinbase,
 SMCI,


Intel,
 Rocket,
 which
 had
 a
 great


earnings,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 Open,
 and
 then


Regetti.
 Unfortunately
 for
 Beyond
 Meat,


that
 stock
 got
 clobbered
 again
 today.


Um,
 again,
 there
 are
 people
 that
 are


deeply
 in
 this
 name
 like
 this
 guy
 who


has
 927,900


shares
 of
 Beyond
 Meat,
 62%
 of
 his


portfolio,
 1.5
 million.
 He
 posted
 this


publicly.


And
 uh,


you
 know,
 that's
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 I


feel
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 places
 you


could
 put
 that
 money,
 but
 nonetheless,


it
 is
 uh
 in
 Beyond
 Meat.
 Now,
 again,
 I


do
 think
 there
 might
 be
 a
 bigger
 story


to
 Beyond
 Meat
 given
 that
 the
 uh
 given


that
 the
 short
 float
 is
 161%
 and
 so
 the


shorts
 are
 literally
 borrowing
 shares


that
 don't
 exist.
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 the


riskreward
 on
 betting
 on
 some
 massive


short
 squeeze,
 you
 know,
 might
 not
 be


the
 most
 fun.
 But
 you
 got
 that
 part
 of


the
 market
 and
 then
 you
 got
 a
 company


like
 Amazon
 that's
 actually
 like
 putting


up
 earnings
 that
 really
 matters.
 So


there
 you
 go.


Go
 all
 in
 on
 beyond
 and
 prove
 the
 haters


wrong.
 You
 might
 have
 to.
 You
 might.
 You


might
 have
 to.
 All right.
 So
 let's
 get


into
 some
 of
 the
 headlines.
 We'll
 keep


talking
 from
 there.
 I
 think
 Steve
 will


be
 joining
 a
 little
 bit.
 We'll
 get
 his


perspectives
 on
 what
 we
 got.
 But
 uh


let's
 preview
 next
 week
 because


obviously
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Pounder
 Weekly
 will
 be
 tonight
 11
 p.m.
 I


know
 we
 haven't
 done
 it
 in
 a
 long
 time,


but
 we
 will
 be
 live
 for
 Pounder
 Weekly


and
 uh
 we'll
 go
 through
 earnings


expectations
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 So,
 uh


look,
 my
 simple
 preview
 right
 now
 is
 I


think
 they're
 going
 to
 they
 guided
 for


50%
 growth,
 1.09
 billion.
 Last
 year,


they
 did
 700
 25
 million.
 So,
 they're


going
 to
 need
 to
 come
 in
 at
 like
 1.15


1.2
 to
 really
 have
 an
 accelerated
 beat


above
 the
 50%
 guidance
 that
 they
 gave.


That's
 what
 I'm
 expecting.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 we're
 going to
 get
 it.
 Maybe
 we
 do,


maybe
 we
 don't.
 If
 we
 don't,
 maybe
 the


stock
 tanks.
 If
 we
 do,
 maybe
 the
 stock


is
 flat.
 If
 we
 really
 beat
 it,
 maybe
 the


stock
 gets
 to
 220,
 2
 to
 210.
 It's
 now


that
 the
 move
 has
 already
 happened.


Remember,
 pounder
 was
 at
 170
 last
 week.


So
 my
 perspective
 was
 maybe
 it
 settles


around
 185
 and
 then
 a
 really
 good


quarter
 gets
 us
 to
 200.
 That
 move's


happened.
 And
 so
 now
 it
 complicates
 the


earnings
 picture.
 That's
 why
 it's
 so


hard
 to
 to
 bet
 on
 earnings.
 And
 same


thing
 with
 Hood.
 I
 mean,
 Hood
 has
 kind


of
 made
 a
 move
 back
 to
 alltime
 highs


before
 earnings.
 So
 these
 companies
 are


going
 to
 really
 have
 to
 put
 up
 amazing


numbers.
 And
 if
 they
 can
 put
 up
 those


numbers,
 then
 that's
 obviously
 going
 to


help
 their
 share
 price
 as
 well.
 Twilio,


wow,
 look
 at
 that.
 19%
 day
 for
 Twilio.


It
 was
 even
 higher
 at
 one
 point.
 It
 was


at
 138.
 So,
 some
 of
 these
 SAS
 companies


really
 put
 up
 some
 good
 numbers.
 We


talked
 about
 that
 yesterday.
 And
 Roku


was
 up
 7%
 as
 well


on
 the
 day,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Yeah,


Shift
 4
 is
 next
 week.
 AMD,
 SMCI,
 got
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 next
 week
 that
 we
 are


going
 to
 be
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 with
 some


of
 those
 earnings
 expectations.
 Let's


get
 into
 a
 few
 more
 of
 these
 headlines.


First
 of
 all,
 Trump
 was
 speaking
 with
 uh


some
 reporters
 as
 he
 landed
 in
 Florida.


A
 couple
 things
 he
 said
 he's
 willing
 to


meet
 with
 the
 Democrats.
 All
 Democrats


have
 to
 do
 is
 open
 the
 government
 as
 he


was
 speaking
 to
 reporters
 when
 he


arrived
 in
 Florida.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 the


president
 trying
 to
 get
 this
 shutdown
 to


be
 done.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 that's
 really


important
 about
 the
 shutdown
 and
 this
 is


something
 that
 uh
 started
 getting


alerted
 a
 couple
 of
 hours
 ago
 because
 we


are
 getting
 to
 the
 point
 where
 you
 know


it
 matters
 is
 uh
 SNAP
 benefits.
 So,
 we


are
 getting
 to
 the
 point
 where
 the


government's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start


tapping
 some
 emergency
 funds
 to
 to


navigate
 benefits
 that
 the
 country
 is


going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 out
 to
 people
 that


are
 on
 those
 benefits.
 There's
 an
 update


on
 that


>> is
 Emily
 Wilkins
 does
 and
 she
 joins
 us


now
 from
 DC.


>> Hey
 Brian.
 Well,
 we
 were
 waiting
 to
 see


how
 federal
 courts
 would
 rule
 today
 on


the
 Trump
 administration
 deciding
 to
 not


be
 funding
 the
 SNAP
 program
 on
 November


1st.
 We
 now
 actually
 have
 two
 different


judges
 making
 two
 different
 rulings.


Let's
 start
 with
 the
 one
 in
 Rhode


Island.
 That
 judge
 basically
 ruled
 from


the
 bench
 telling
 the
 US
 government
 that


they
 need
 to
 find
 funding
 for
 that
 SNAP


program.
 They
 mentioned
 the
 contingency


fund.
 This
 is
 the
 one
 that
 Brooke


Rollins,
 a
 secretary,
 just
 told
 us
 a


little
 bit
 ago
 they
 couldn't
 use.
 Now,
 a


federal
 judge
 is
 saying,
 "You
 need
 to
 go


ahead
 and
 use
 that."
 A
 Massachusetts


judge,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 also
 seems
 to


be
 leaning
 in
 the
 direction
 that
 the


government
 will
 need
 to
 provide
 SNAP


benefits
 somehow,
 that
 they
 cannot
 cut


off
 the
 program,
 but
 they're
 saying
 that


they
 need
 the
 White
 House
 to
 actually


put
 in
 writing
 that
 they
 plan
 to
 not


continue
 to
 fund
 that
 program
 or
 that


they're
 not
 planning
 on
 finding
 a
 backup


source
 of
 funding.
 So,
 two
 different


judges
 there.
 Kind
 of
 in
 the
 same
 vein,


though.
 It
 sounds
 like
 the
 overall


takeaway
 from
 this
 is
 that
 the
 courts


are
 telling
 uh
 the
 Trump
 administration


that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 find
 a


way
 to
 get
 funds
 into
 the
 SNAP
 program


and
 they're
 not
 just
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


end
 it
 tomorrow
 as
 was
 fear.


>> Now,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really


important
 because
 there
 are
 Americans


that
 have
 those
 food
 benefits
 and
 the


Trump
 administration
 by
 cutting
 off


those
 food
 benefits
 obviously
 was
 going


to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 angry
 at
 the


Democrats,
 right?
 The
 whole
 point
 is


like
 if
 you
 can
 get
 your
 constituents
 to


get
 mad
 at
 the
 people
 that
 are
 shutting


down
 the
 country
 from
 the
 Republicans's


perspective,
 then
 you
 could
 possibly
 get


them
 to
 come
 to
 the
 negotiating
 table.


Well,
 you
 got
 federal
 judges
 saying


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 allowed
 to
 do


that
 because
 people
 need
 to
 eat
 and
 you


have
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 fund
 the
 way
 for


people
 to
 get
 the
 funding
 for
 them
 to


eat
 via
 these
 SNAP
 benefits.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 it
 continues
 to
 complicate
 the


picture
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 shutdown.


So,
 I
 think
 that's
 another
 layer
 to


November
 that
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


navigate.
 And
 I'm
 I
 should
 do
 a
 poll


right
 here
 given
 that
 November
 is
 uh


upon
 us
 tomorrow.
 Uh
 and
 here's
 the


question.
 Very
 simple
 question.


Green
 or
 red
 November?


Green
 or
 red
 November?
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 green
 because
 seasonally
 it


ends
 up
 usually
 being
 green
 by
 an


average
 of
 4%.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 November


is
 going
 to
 be
 fine.
 But
 I
 also
 do
 think


there's
 some
 choppiness
 to
 expect
 in


November
 given
 navigating
 the
 shutdown


and
 all
 this
 earnings
 that
 has
 to
 be


digested.
 Uh
 Fed
 Governor
 Waller
 says
 we


have a
 lot
 of
 data
 despite
 the


government
 shutdown.
 We
 did
 get
 a
 little


bit
 more
 data
 today
 from
 the
 PMI
 which


was
 important.
 And
 then
 Axio
 is


reporting
 the
 US
 House
 will
 stay
 out
 of


session
 next
 week
 under
 Speaker
 Mike


Johnson's
 plan
 continuing
 the
 indefinite


recess
 amid
 the
 31-day
 shutdown.
 Wow,
 we


are
 at
 day
 31.
 Four
 more
 days
 and


officially
 this
 is
 longest
 shutdown
 in


history.
 No
 votes
 are
 expected
 per
 the


current
 strategy.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 another
 thing


that
 we
 have
 to
 navigate
 going
 into


November.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 down
 a


little
 bit
 more
 after
 hours
 244


as
 it
 has
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle.


You
 know,
 my
 answer
 is
 orange.
 I
 mean,


look,
 November
 tends
 to
 not
 be
 horrible


for
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.
 October
 tends
 to
 be
 really
 good,


but
 it
 is
 quite
 surprising.
 Even
 with


rate
 cuts,
 even
 with
 M2
 supply


increasing,


uh
 October
 just
 wasn't
 friendly
 enough


for
 Bitcoin.
 Not
 this
 time.
 And
 it


really
 begs
 the
 question,
 what
 exactly


happened
 uh
 in
 October.
 Now,
 2024
 and


2023,
 November
 was
 great.
 So,
 we
 had
 an


8%
 2023
 and
 a
 37%
 move
 in
 2024.
 And
 then


in
 2020,
 you
 had
 a
 42%
 move.
 So,
 2021


and
 2022
 were
 not
 the
 best
 for
 Bitcoin,


but
 23
 and
 24
 have
 been
 pretty
 good.


Maybe
 some
 consolidation
 in
 October
 is


not
 horrible


as
 we
 uh
 as
 we
 get
 ready
 for
 November,


which
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 bad.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 that
 one


also
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Um,
 all
 right.


So,
 couple
 updates
 right
 there
 in
 terms


of
 the
 Fed
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 what's
 going


on
 with
 the
 White
 House.
 Let
 me
 pull
 up


a
 couple
 other
 things
 right
 here
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 First


of
 all,
 Coinbase
 uh
 they
 acquired
 a


futures
 derivative
 firm
 called
 Derivit


uh
 last
 what
 three
 months
 ago
 uh


reportedly
 in
 stages
 to
 acquire
 another


company
 called
 BBNK.
 And
 the
 idea
 here


is
 to
 strengthen
 Coinbase's
 stablecoin


and
 payments
 infrastructure.
 Once
 again,


stable
 coins
 continuing
 to
 get
 more


momentum.
 The
 move
 aligns
 with
 broader


consolidation
 and
 strategic
 positioning


in
 crypto
 finance.
 Coinbase
 is


reportedly
 nearing
 a
 $2
 billion


acquisition.
 Again,
 they
 absolutely


crushed
 earnings,
 but
 as
 they
 want
 to


expand,
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 more
 and


more
 acquisitions.
 Another
 piece
 of


macro
 news
 that
 we
 have
 uh
 right
 here
 is


that,
 let's
 pull
 this
 up.
 US
 bank


deposits
 fell
 to
 18.5
 trillion
 from


18.508
 trillion
 in
 the
 prior
 week.
 So,


you
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 decline
 on


bank
 deposits.
 Nothing
 too
 substantial,


but
 nothing
 like
 the
 I
 forgot
 October


was
 so
 crazy.
 We
 had
 this
 regional


banking
 credit
 crisis
 that
 people
 were


so
 scared
 about.
 And
 you
 know
 that
 ended


up
 lasting
 for
 like
 a
 day
 and
 then
 no


one
 cared.
 So
 the
 banks
 also
 started
 off


October
 with
 a
 really
 strong
 earning


session.
 I
 mean
 Jamie
 Diamond
 Tanner
 was


on
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 and
 he
 shared
 the


clip
 of
 Jamie
 Diamond
 saying
 he's
 now


embracing
 stable
 coins
 at
 the
 uh
 Middle


Eastern
 conference
 and
 specifically
 he


said
 that
 he
 was
 wrong
 on
 stable
 coins


even
 after
 calling
 Bitcoin
 a
 fraud
 and


all
 that
 stuff.
 This
 is
 the
 clip
 for


those
 that
 didn't
 see
 that.


>> Skeptical
 of
 crypto
 at
 one
 point.


I've
 gotten
 away
 with
 no
 damage
 so
 far.


Crypto
 is
 real.
 If
 you
 mean
 blockchain,


stable
 coins,
 you
 have
 a
 JP
 Morgan


deposit
 coin.
 You
 can
 move
 stuff.
 Smart


contracts
 are
 real.
 All
 that
 stuff
 is


real.
 It
 will
 be
 used
 by
 all
 of
 us
 to


facilitate,
 you
 know,
 better


transactions
 and
 customer.


>> Anybody
 skeptical?


>> There
 you
 go.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 I
 know
 the


price
 action
 is
 not
 the
 best
 on
 ETH
 and


Bitcoin,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 a
 Jamie


Diamond,
 Larry
 Frink,
 and
 a
 variety
 of


these
 crypto
 CEOs
 that
 are
 obviously


more
 friendly
 towards
 the
 state
 of


what's
 going
 on
 in
 regards
 to


blockchain.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we've
 got


there.
 All right,
 Grab,
 let
 me
 play
 this


video.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 have
 been
 asking
 for
 this.
 Shout


out
 to
 Mike
 for
 getting
 this
 clip.
 This


was
 the
 CEO
 COO
 of
 the
 company,
 Chief


Operating
 Officer,
 Alex
 Hungate.
 Here's


what
 he
 had
 to
 say
 about
 how
 Grab
 is


embracing
 AI.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 really
 good


15-minute
 interview,
 but
 this
 two-minute


clip
 kind
 of
 highlights
 the
 nature
 of


Grab
 becoming
 more
 of
 an
 AI
 company
 as


we
 get
 into
 earnings
 on
 Monday
 that
 we


have.
 How
 are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 that?
 Uh


the
 good
 news
 is
 that
 Grab
 is
 already


quite
 a
 big
 AI
 player.
 We
 run
 about


10,000
 AI
 models
 already.
 Uh
 which
 makes


us
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 bigger
 ones
 in


the
 region.
 Um,
 and
 a
 function
 that
 we


already
 play
 is
 we
 bridge
 between
 the


large
 foundation
 models
 which
 are
 being


produced
 largely
 out
 of
 the
 US
 at
 the


moment
 and
 then
 we
 make
 them
 more


relevant
 for
 Southeast
 Asia.
 We're
 the


only
 lighthouse
 partner
 for
 OpenAI
 in


the
 region
 which
 means
 we
 get
 access
 to


foundational
 models
 as
 soon
 as
 they're


ready
 but
 before
 the
 official
 releases


and
 then
 we
 fine-tune
 them.
 Um,
 and
 I


give
 you
 example
 of
 how
 important
 that


is.
 When
 we
 first
 got
 the
 um
 the
 40


model,
 we
 tried
 to
 use
 it
 for
 speech


recognition
 because
 we
 were
 targeting
 to


help
 the
 visually
 impaired
 to
 be
 able
 to


use
 the
 app
 better.
 It
 only
 worked
 45%


of
 the
 time
 for
 Southeast
 Asia
 and
 that


was
 in
 English.
 That's
 in
 English.
 So


45%
 of
 the
 time
 an
 English
 speaker
 tried


to
 use
 it
 in
 Southeast
 Asia
 and
 because


of
 our
 different
 accents,
 different


place
 names,
 etc.,
 it
 didn't
 work.
 That


makes
 it
 not
 fit
 for
 purpose.
 So
 we


we've
 had
 about
 120,000
 Southeast
 Asians


have
 given
 us
 voice
 samples.
 So
 now
 it's


92%
 accuracy,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad


actually.
 Yeah.
 So
 that's
 one
 role
 that


we
 can
 play.
 Another
 role
 is
 we're


trying
 to
 improve
 the
 productivity
 of


our
 drivers
 by
 giving
 them
 uh
 what
 we


call
 co-pilot.
 It
 helps
 them
 to
 position


themselves
 during
 the
 day,
 make
 sure


that
 they
 get
 the
 the
 maximum
 possible


earnings
 that
 they
 can
 get.
 Um
 it


informs
 them
 of
 road
 closures.
 They


themselves
 can
 report
 road
 closures,
 you


know,
 using
 voice
 so
 it's
 not
 unsafe.
 Um


for
 the
 merchants,
 we're
 trying
 to
 help


them
 with
 a
 merchant
 chat,
 what
 we
 call


merchant
 chatbot,


which
 has
 been
 phenomenal.
 You
 know,
 not


only
 they
 did
 they
 get
 the
 CFO
 and
 a


CMO,
 but
 they
 also
 get
 like
 emotional


support.
 A
 life
 coach,
 one
 of
 the


merchants
 in
 Indonesia
 actually
 two


weeks
 ago
 was
 showing
 me
 her
 chat
 with


her
 her
 Grab
 chatbot
 and
 she'd
 been


she'd
 been
 asking
 about,
 oh,
 you
 know,


how
 do
 I
 get
 sales
 up,
 etc.
 And
 then
 it


got
 to,
 oh,
 can
 you
 give
 me
 advice
 on


different
 menu
 items?
 And
 the
 chatbot


kind
 of
 looked
 at
 the
 different


restaurants
 in
 the
 area,
 worked
 out
 what


people
 were
 searching
 for,
 worked
 out


what
 the
 gaps
 were
 and
 and
 suggested.


And
 then
 she
 said,
 "Oh,
 I
 can't
 cook


that.
 You
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 cook
 it?"


Gives
 a
 cooking
 advice.
 Then
 says,
 "Oh,


what
 shall
 I
 put
 in?"
 And
 given
 her


advice
 for
 which
 orders
 to
 put
 in,
 um,


how
 long
 the
 lead
 time
 should
 be
 based


on
 the
 prediction
 and
 number
 of
 sales.


And
 then
 that's
 not
 all.
 The
 last
 part


which
 is
 absolutely
 the
 best
 part.
 The


last
 part
 was
 she
 had
 actually
 said
 one


of
 the
 chats
 she
 showed
 me
 said,
 "Oh,


can
 you
 just
 give
 me
 some


encouragement?"


And
 the
 chat
 boys
 say,
 "Hey,
 don't
 worry


sis,
 you're
 doing
 well.


Keep
 it
 up."
 It
 was
 so
 endearing.
 It's


like
 it's
 like
 AI
 with
 heart,
 you
 know.


So,
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 way
 that
 uh
 you


know,
 we
 can
 really
 help.
 And
 of
 course


our
 lending
 um
 and
 insurance
 type


products
 that
 we
 can
 provide
 also
 should


get
 better
 and
 better
 with
 AI.


>> Is
 anyone
 else
 kind?


>> So
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 unpack
 there


but
 at
 its
 core
 you
 know
 there
 are
 a


variety
 of
 different
 AI
 verticals
 that


grab
 is
 stepping
 into
 particularly
 from


the
 use
 cases
 of
 people
 that
 quite


frankly
 depend
 on
 a
 platform
 like
 that.


They
 don't
 have
 a
 CMO
 or
 a
 CFO
 or
 a


entire
 team
 to
 help
 them
 grow
 a


business.
 And
 from
 that
 perspective,


when
 you
 take
 a
 large
 language
 model
 and


fine-tune
 it
 to
 the
 context
 specific


arenas
 of
 what
 Grab
 should
 be
 making
 it


useful
 for,
 which
 is
 the
 whole
 point,


right?
 How
 can
 we
 get
 a
 use
 case
 for


these
 models
 that
 make
 sense?
 By
 the


way,
 QuantumCape
 16%
 day.
 So
 pretty


incredible
 for
 QS
 for
 anyone
 who's
 in


that.
 There's
 a
 battery
 company
 really


big
 move
 today
 is
 that
 one's
 up
 16%.
 Uh


that's
 what
 I
 think
 is
 the
 broader


network
 effect
 that
 the
 company
 is


developing
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 I
 don't


know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 on
 Monday.
 I


don't
 know if
 the
 stock's
 going
 to
 go
 up


or
 down.
 All
 I
 know
 is
 that
 the
 reason


they're
 getting
 the
 market
 share
 of


almost
 75%
 of
 the
 entire
 region
 is


because
 they're
 embracing
 and
 they're


investing
 in
 R&D
 to
 be
 able
 to
 build


products
 and
 suites
 and
 tools
 of


products
 that
 essentially
 are
 going
 to


make
 lives
 much
 better
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 in
 the
 region.
 And
 with
 that
 over


time
 comes
 profitability,
 comes
 earnings


growth,
 etc.
 along
 with
 8
 billion
 cash.


So
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 it
 ultimately


plays
 out.
 But
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 good


interview.
 If
 anyone
 wants
 to
 watch
 it,


I'll
 put
 the
 link
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat.
 And
 you
 know,
 Alex
 is
 a
 phenomenal


COO.
 I
 mean,
 listening
 to
 him
 on
 the


earnings
 calls
 as
 well
 gives
 me
 a
 lot
 of


conviction
 in
 just
 their
 broader


platform
 approach
 and
 how
 they
 think
 of


technology
 as
 a
 way
 to
 unlock


a
 lot
 of
 the
 goods
 for
 people
 that
 are


in
 the
 region.
 Alex
 Hungate
 is
 his
 name


as
 well.
 Um,
 Nebia
 still
 moving
 a
 bit


after
 hours.
 Nebius
 right
 there
 six
 or


130.1313


that's
 up
 5%
 of
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 did


close
 red.
 didn't
 get
 that
 green
 close,


but
 we
 did
 get
 a
 $200


uh
 close
 overall
 for
 the
 week,
 which
 is


nice.
 And
 then
 Palunteer
 is
 still
 200
 as


well,


200.85.


Uh
 Butterfly
 Network,
 this
 one
 is
 a


small
 cap.
 This
 one
 also
 had
 a
 big
 move


today,
 24%.


So
 yeah,
 this
 one
 medical
 imaging
 device


company
 making
 that
 24.5%
 move.
 Volume


was
 pretty
 high
 today.
 Average
 volume
 is


3
 million.
 This
 was
 at
 20.8
 million.


some
 of
 these
 companies
 that
 uh
 you
 know


are
 smaller
 companies
 in
 regards
 to
 the


coverage
 on
 their
 earnings,
 but
 overall


again
 putting
 up
 decent
 growth.
 Reddit


right
 here
 as
 well
 7%
 move
 that
 was
 up


almost
 20%
 at
 one
 day.
 A
 lot
 of
 these


stocks
 got
 faded
 after
 12
 p.m.
 like
 they


really
 peaked
 at
 around
 that
 time
 and


then
 you
 know
 the
 market
 ended
 up


selling
 them
 off


but
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 for


some
 of
 these
 names.
 Um


Cheyion,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 AMD


is
 up
 58%
 this
 month.
 second
 best
 month


ever
 after
 25
 years
 in
 2000.
 What
 do
 you


think
 this
 fundamentally
 means
 since
 58%


on
 a
 $400
 billion
 company's
 a
 lot?
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 this
 is
 similar
 to
 what
 Sutin


said
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 I
 think
 AMD
 is


really
 going
 to
 have
 to
 gear
 up
 their


remaining
 performance
 obligations


guidance
 to
 be
 substantial.
 And
 if
 they


don't,
 I
 mean
 that
 400
 billion
 market


cap
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 bit
 hard
 to
 sustain


until
 the
 growth
 estimates
 come
 in.
 Now


again,
 I
 think
 if
 Lisa
 Sue
 is
 smart,


which
 she
 is,
 they're
 going
 to
 increase


guidance
 dramatically,
 which
 is
 going
 to


justify
 why
 it
 had
 that
 58%
 move.
 At
 the


end
 of the
 day,
 if
 opening
 eye
 is
 going


to
 pay
 you
 80
 to
 100
 billion
 over
 the


next
 five
 years,
 if
 you
 can
 just
 factor


that
 into
 the
 guidance,
 if
 you're


confident
 enough
 to
 believe
 that
 that
 is


going
 to
 manifest
 itself,
 then
 I
 think


the
 street's
 going to
 be
 fine
 with
 it.
 I


mean,
 who
 knows?
 They
 might
 have
 ended


up
 growing
 Q3
 way
 faster
 than
 expected


without
 OpenAI,
 and
 that
 in
 and
 of


itself
 helps
 the
 stock.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 AMD
 has
 to
 collapse.
 I
 think


there'll
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 dip
 buyers
 if
 it


does
 have
 a
 10-15%
 dip.
 But,
 they've
 got


to
 give
 us
 a
 good
 guidance
 number.
 And


it
 should
 be
 like
 that,
 right?
 If
 you


have
 a
 58%
 move
 in
 your
 stock,
 you


should
 have
 to
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good


numbers.
 But
 I
 think
 AMD


will
 uh
 will
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 do
 it.


>> Um,
 okay,
 Meta.
 Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 Meta.
 So,
 let's
 do
 a
 poll


right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 let's
 kind
 of


get
 some
 sentiment
 on
 what
 people
 are


thinking
 on
 Meta.
 I
 guess
 here's
 the


question.


How
 many
 people
 think
 this
 Meta
 dip
 is


justified
 based
 on
 the
 earnings?
 78%
 of


you
 said
 we
 will
 have
 a
 green
 November.


22%
 said
 red.
 Is
 the
 Meta
 dip
 justified?


Aka,


should
 Meta
 be
 getting
 punished
 the
 way


that
 it's
 getting
 punished?


Because
 in
 my
 opinion,
 I
 think
 the


answer
 is
 no.
 I
 think
 it's
 very,
 very


hard
 to
 say
 that
 this
 company
 deserves


to
 get
 the
 type
 of
 hit
 that
 it's


getting.
 Again,
 this
 was
 kind
 of the


theme
 of
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 in


the
 morning.
 these
 companies,
 the


hyperscalers,
 and
 in
 fact,
 I'm
 thinking


of
 uh
 writing
 out
 a
 Substack
 post
 around


this
 entire
 thesis,
 which
 is
 that
 the


hyperscalers
 should
 be
 the
 best
 and


easiest
 investments
 of
 our
 lifetime.
 If


we're
 all
 going
 to
 live
 for
 the
 next
 50


to
 100
 years,
 the
 Max
 7
 should
 be
 the


most
 important
 companies
 in
 the
 world


that
 we
 deserve
 to
 benefit
 from
 because


we're
 using
 their
 products
 and
 services


every
 day
 if
 we
 choose
 to
 invest
 in


them.
 So
 I
 like
 I'm
 gonna
 go
 deeper
 into


Meta's
 numbers,
 but
 the
 given
 they
 said


they're
 probably
 going
 to
 spend
 close
 to


hundred
 billion
 dollars
 in
 fiscal
 year


2026.
 By
 the
 way,
 Amazon's
 going
 to


spend
 more
 than$125
 billion.
 Google's


spending
 93
 billion,
 Microsoft's


spending
 closer
 to
 150
 billion.
 So
 if


all
 these
 companies
 are
 spending
 these


massive
 amounts
 of
 capex,
 it's
 not
 that


the
 street
 is
 upset
 that
 Meta
 is


spending
 more
 because
 they
 expect
 them


to
 spend
 more.
 It's
 that
 they
 don't


think
 there's
 an
 ROI
 on
 that
 spend,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 laughable
 given
 ad


impressions
 are
 up
 14%,
 average
 price


per
 ad
 is
 up
 10%,
 and
 revenue
 growth
 is


up
 26%.


So
 it
 it
 really
 is
 incredible
 to
 see.
 I


I
 I'm
 trying
 to
 rationalize
 why
 the


street
 is
 so
 upset.
 But
 nonetheless,


they
 are
 upset.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 if


Meta
 enters
 into
 an
 Amazon
 or
 Google


phase
 in
 2026
 where
 the
 narrative
 sucks,


whether
 it's
 AWS
 or
 the
 narrative
 sucks


on
 Google,
 whether
 it's
 DOJ
 concerns,


who
 knows?
 Maybe
 the
 stock
 is
 flat
 in


26.
 You
 know,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 big
 mover


in
 24
 and
 25.
 Maybe
 it's
 flat
 in
 26.


Maybe
 that's
 a
 consolidation
 year
 which


ended
 up
 proving
 to
 be
 healthy
 for


Google
 and
 Amazon
 after
 their
 recent


runs.
 But
 that
 is
 something
 that
 we
 have


to
 think
 about


in
 regards
 to
 what
 would
 happen
 for


metaverse
 to
 for
 meta.
 Did
 he
 finish
 the


metaverse?
 I
 I
 he
 actually
 lost
 another


four
 billion
 in
 the
 past
 90
 days
 under


the
 for
 the
 metaverse.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 do


think
 the
 street
 has
 a
 point
 where
 they


can
 say,
 "Hey
 Zucks,
 like
 no
 one's
 using


that
 [ __ ]
 You
 can
 cut
 it
 out."
 Like


it's
 not
 that
 serious.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 find
 out
 if


that
 actually
 happens.
 Meta
 is
 indeed


under
 the
 200
 day,
 which
 is
 why
 it
 gets


scary
 here.
 Now,
 if
 it
 loses
 support


right
 here,
 this
 is
 where
 you
 can
 see
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 dip
 if
 that
 ends
 up


happening.
 Zuck
 sounded
 bearish
 on
 the


call.
 Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 sounded


bearish.
 I
 think
 he
 just
 sounded
 like


annoyed
 with
 questions,
 which
 is
 yeah,


it's
 bearish
 because
 like
 that's
 not


what
 you
 want
 to
 sound
 like
 when
 you're


talking
 to
 analysts.
 But
 nonetheless,


pretty
 much
 all
 the
 analysts
 upgraded


the
 stock.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 they
 were


that
 upset
 about
 it.


But
 I
 agree,
 he
 did
 not
 sound
 the
 best.


Why
 are
 you
 guys
 calling
 Tanner


Tannerella?
 Do
 we
 have
 another
 nickname


for
 Tanner?
 Goodness,
 dude.
 This
 guy
 has


more
 nicknames
 than
 me.
 You
 guys
 have


figured
 out
 more
 nicknames
 for
 Mr.


Tanner
 than
 for
 myself.


Lori
 Tannerella.


He
 brings
 it
 on
 himself
 though.
 He


absolutely


brings
 it
 on
 himself.
 Um,
 poll
 right


here
 says
 64
 64%
 no.


64%
 no.
 All right,
 folks.
 Let's
 bring


someone
 on
 to
 the
 market
 close
 on
 this


Friday
 and
 get
 their
 thoughts
 on
 what's


been
 going
 on
 over
 the
 past
 week
 in
 the


global
 capital
 equity
 markets.


Um,


I
 mean,
 he
 has
 two
 words
 to
 his
 name,


but
 to
 be
 honest,
 we
 should
 just
 call


him
 the
 second
 word
 because
 there's
 no


reason
 to
 even
 say
 the
 first
 word.
 It's


Matt
 money,
 but
 we
 should
 just
 call
 him


money.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


>> Matt,
 what's
 up,


>> sir?
 Mr.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me
 on.


Happy
 to
 be
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 coming
 on,
 man.
 How
 are


you?
 Did
 you
 work
 from
 home
 today
 or
 are


you
 just
 back?


>> Uh,
 I
 did.
 I
 didn't.
 Uh,
 to
 be
 very


fair,
 hopefully
 nobody
 from
 work
 is


watching.
 I
 don't
 do
 too
 much
 work
 but


uh


but
 uh
 but
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


>> All right.
 Well,
 I
 think
 I'll
 get


started
 with
 uh
 my
 first
 question
 right


here
 which
 is
 a
 journey
 we
 have
 been


part
 of
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Palunteer
 at


200o.
 I
 mean
 just
 how
 are
 you
 thinking


of
 uh
 of
 this
 stock
 at
 this
 level?


>> Uh
 I
 either
 bought
 more
 today
 or


yesterday
 I
 think.
 Um


>> yeah.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 not
 buying
 a
 lot,


right?
 Just
 the
 monthly
 buys
 that
 I


always
 have.
 Every
 time
 I
 get
 a


paycheck,
 I
 just


>> just
 get
 your
 mic
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 on


the
 gain.


>> Uh,
 is
 it
 is
 it
 a
 little
 little
 crazy?


>> Little
 hot.


>> Little
 hot.
 I
 think
 it's
 all
 the
 way


down.
 Maybe
 I'll
 just
 move
 it
 away
 a


little bit.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Uh,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 that's
 a
 little


bit.


>> That's
 perfect.
 I
 think
 that's
 way


>> Okay,
 perfect.
 Perfect.
 Um,
 yeah,
 I'm


trying
 to
 adjust
 the
 mic
 to
 make
 it
 a


little
 bit
 more
 full
 sounding.
 So,
 maybe


I
 made
 it
 too
 full.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 uh,
 I


just
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 to
 be


released
 still,
 like
 AI,
 FTE,
 a
 lot
 of
 a


lot
 of
 great
 products
 that
 I
 don't
 think


have
 been
 fully
 rolled
 out
 as
 of
 yet.


And
 when
 that
 does
 actually
 come


through,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a


lot
 of
 efficiency
 gains
 in
 a
 lot
 of


different
 companies.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 the
 the


ops
 margins
 for
 Palanteer
 are
 continuing


to
 do
 well.
 I
 anticipate
 and
 and
 I
 think


Arie
 had
 a
 really
 good
 post
 earlier


talking
 about
 how
 he
 thinks
 that
 that's


going
 to
 be
 a
 good
 story
 coming
 up
 this


this
 uh
 this
 quarter
 as
 well,
 but
 I'm


more
 so
 concerned
 about
 how
 many
 more


small
 contracts
 we
 can
 get,
 right?
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been
 very
 I


think
 the
 only
 thing
 they're
 complaining


about
 now
 is
 oh
 well
 they
 only
 have
 a


thousand
 customers
 or
 whatever.
 It's


like,
 well,
 I
 think
 with
 what
 they
 come


out
 with
 in
 the
 near
 future
 will
 allow


them
 to
 attack
 some
 of
 those
 smaller


customers
 uh
 that
 could
 actually
 add
 a


lot
 to
 the
 bottom
 line
 as
 well,
 but
 they


don't
 have
 necessarily
 the
 the


operational
 footprint,
 meaning
 the
 floor


deployment
 engineers
 to
 be
 able
 to


actually
 go
 to
 every
 single
 company,


right?
 And
 I
 think
 that


>> uh
 this
 this
 will
 really
 help.
 Um,
 so


I'm
 very
 happy
 to
 see
 uh
 the
 progress
 of


the
 company
 and
 I'm
 also
 anticipating
 a


50%
 growth
 handle
 uh
 year-over-year.
 So


it'll
 be
 it'll
 be
 fun
 to
 watch.
 It'll
 be


fun
 to
 watch.


>> I
 think
 the
 cool
 thing
 about
 it
 is
 you


and
 I
 both
 as
 the
 company
 started
 rising


and
 its
 price
 felt
 the
 valuation
 was


getting
 aggressive
 and
 we
 were
 pretty


transparent
 about
 that
 similar
 you
 know


to
 Arie
 and
 Amir
 as
 well.
 But
 it's
 it's


almost
 all
 of
 us
 have
 been
 humbled
 by


the
 fact
 that
 the
 execution
 is
 so
 strong


and
 now
 it's
 like
 oh
 at
 some
 point
 you


got
 to
 buy
 if
 you
 want
 more
 of
 it,


right?
 And
 to
 your
 philosophy
 of
 just


continuing
 to
 get
 more
 of
 it.
 You
 kind


of
 say
 screw
 the
 the
 beautiful
 10
 $15


average
 and
 you
 just
 get
 more.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 look
 at
 it
 in
 a
 different


way,
 right?
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 somebody


about
 this
 yesterday.
 They're
 like
 are


you
 like
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 Like
 should


I
 sell
 here?
 Whatever.
 And
 first
 and


foremost
 I
 think
 when
 people
 think
 about


this,
 right?
 If
 they've
 been
 in
 it
 like


you
 and
 I
 have
 and
 they
 have
 shares,


let's
 say
 at
 the
 $67
 8
 range
 and
 then


they
 sell
 here
 at
 200,
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 pay,
 you
 know,
 pretty
 much
 uh
 15


to
 20%
 depending
 on
 what
 tax
 bracket
 uh


for
 federal
 tax
 um
 on
 long-term
 capital


gains.
 So
 before
 they
 enter
 even
 back


in,
 the
 stock
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 go


down
 to
 uh
 to
 at least
 $160
 before
 they


even
 make
 an
 entry
 back
 in.
 And
 so
 um


before
 they
 break
 even,
 right?
 Unless


it's
 in
 a
 tax
 advantage
 account,
 then


you
 could
 play
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 games


with
 that.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 people


think
 about
 that
 a
 lot.
 I
 think
 they


say,
 "Oh,
 I
 got
 5%
 more
 shares."
 It's


like,
 "Well,
 you
 also
 just
 locked
 in
 a


20%
 or
 in
 short-term
 capital
 gains
 a


30%,
 you
 know,
 the
 tax
 rate
 that
 you
 had


to
 pay."


>> But
 so
 anyway,
 going
 back
 into
 the
 real


the
 real
 aspect
 of
 it,
 I
 I
 just
 the
 the


the
 execution
 that
 I
 continue
 to
 see
 out


of
 the
 company,
 you
 know,
 five
 years


ago,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 150


to20
 billion
 dollar
 company.
 And
 since


then,
 and
 it's
 documented
 literally


almost
 every
 week
 when
 when
 I
 had
 the


opportunity
 to
 come
 on
 Palunteer
 weekly


was
 like,
 "Nope,
 it
 it
 moved
 right
 to


the
 point
 where,
 you
 know,
 it
 got
 to
 a


trillion
 dollar
 valuation
 and
 and
 and


more
 recently
 I've
 moved
 it
 to
 a


trillion
 and
 a
 half."
 And
 some
 people


might
 say
 that
 that's
 that's
 still


bearish
 and
 I
 I
 can
 agree
 with
 that.


Like
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 still


potentially
 undervaluing
 the
 potential,


but
 I
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 too
 far


ahead
 of
 myself.
 Um,
 but
 if
 you
 think


about
 in
 that
 respect,
 it's
 like
 we're


only
 at
 a
 500
 billion
 compared
 to
 that


1.5.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 buybacks


and
 and
 so
 many
 other
 things
 along
 the


way,
 it's
 like
 when
 you
 have


opportunities
 like
 this
 of
 certainty,


right?
 Why
 bet
 against
 certainty?


>> Yep.


>> Um,
 and
 I
 understand
 that
 you're
 like,


"Oh,
 well
 that
 money
 could
 have
 used


elsewhere.
 I
 can
 make
 a
 5
 10x


elsewhere."
 But
 Palanteer
 to
 me
 is


certain,
 right?
 If
 you
 look
 at
 those


things
 that
 might
 get
 you
 5
 to
 10x,
 they


might
 not
 be
 certain.
 And
 so
 to
 me,
 you


know,
 I'm
 not
 looking
 for
 when
 I
 have


those
 things
 of
 certainty.
 Palunteer
 was


a
 certainty
 for
 me.
 Rocket
 Lab
 was
 a


certainty
 for
 me.
 I
 like
 to
 bet
 on


certainty.
 And
 so,
 um,
 why
 like
 same


thing
 with
 Amazon,
 right?
 We'll
 get
 into


that,
 I'm
 sure.
 So,
 it's
 like,
 why
 bet


against
 it,
 you
 know?
 Um,
 and
 that's


kind
 of
 where
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 why
 have


I
 not
 been
 averaging
 up?
 And
 that's
 why


I
 restarted
 my
 buys.


>> I
 agree.
 Sometimes
 your
 best
 ideas
 are


your
 original
 ideas,
 your
 first
 ideas,


you
 know,
 and
 like
 as
 there's
 plenty
 of


opportunities
 in
 the
 market,
 owning
 more


of
 something
 definitely
 is
 uh
 in
 the


long
 term,
 especially
 if
 you're,
 as
 you


said,
 you're
 so
 confident
 that
 you
 know


it's
 a
 winner
 and
 they've
 proven
 they're


a
 winner,
 even
 if
 they
 are
 expensive.


You're
 not
 having
 to
 buy
 at
 this
 price


for
 the
 first
 time.
 So,


>> averaging
 up
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world.
 Um,
 so
 before
 we
 get
 into


Amazon,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 more


broadly
 about
 big
 tech
 earnings.


Obviously,
 pretty
 much
 all
 of
 them


crushed
 it
 across
 the
 board,
 even
 if


some
 of
 their
 stock
 prices
 didn't


reflect
 that.
 Are
 you
 kind
 of
 on
 the


same
 page
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people,


which
 is
 that
 and
 and
 I
 know
 you've


you've
 been
 buying
 most
 of
 these
 for
 a


long
 time,
 but
 big
 tech
 is
 just
 going
 to


get
 bigger
 and
 26
 people
 should
 be


thinking
 about
 just
 continuing
 to
 DCA


into
 the
 best
 companies
 in
 the
 world.


>> I
 think
 that
 26
 will
 be
 a
 good
 year,
 but


I
 think
 it'll
 be
 I
 think
 we're
 entering


the
 the
 latter
 half
 of
 the
 this
 very


extreme
 bullish
 easy
 money
 stage.
 Now,


it
 could
 run
 into
 27.
 You
 know,
 I
 what
 I


don't
 think
 is,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 I'll
 be


humbled
 and
 I'
 I've
 been
 humbled
 before


by
 because
 you
 think
 about
 it.
 Amazon's


investing
 over
 100
 billion.
 They're


going
 to
 invest
 over
 125
 billion
 before


the
 year
 end.
 And
 and
 Meta
 is
 investing


a
 lot
 of
 money
 as
 well.
 So,
 all
 these


companies,
 but


they
 keep
 talking
 about
 expanding
 the


amount
 of
 capital
 that
 they're
 going
 to


plow
 in.
 And
 the
 really
 the
 only
 ones


that
 have
 excess
 capital
 that
 they
 can


without
 dipping
 into
 their
 coffers
 is


Microsoft
 and
 and
 Amazon.
 And
 everybody


else
 is
 having
 to
 dip
 into
 their
 cash


pile.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 or


Yeah.
 Or
 or
 or
 issue
 debt
 in
 the
 case
 of


Oracle,
 right?
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't


think
 that
 we're
 in
 this,
 you
 know,


unless
 that
 the
 income
 really
 starts
 to


come
 through
 and
 the
 cash
 flow
 really


starts
 to
 come
 through,
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 start
 hitting
 a
 wall
 a
 bit.
 And


I'm
 not,
 when
 I
 say
 wall,
 it
 makes
 it


seem
 more
 extreme.
 I'm
 not
 bearish
 by


any
 means.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 sell
 these


things,
 but
 I'm
 just
 saying
 there's


going
 to
 be
 some
 backlash
 associated


with
 when
 we
 actually
 hit
 and
 we
 can't


grow
 capital
 expenditure,
 you
 know,
 from


50
 billion
 to
 100
 billion
 like
 we
 have


been
 able
 to
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Amazon
 or


even
 125
 billion
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Amazon


in
 in
 as
 rapid
 of
 a
 pace
 because
 you


think
 about
 how
 much
 of
 a
 a
 valuation


that
 Nvidia
 has
 been
 able
 to
 get
 and
 how


much
 people
 continue
 to
 price
 that
 in.


you
 know,
 if
 you
 start
 to
 have


pullbacks,
 you're
 going to
 either
 have


to
 pull
 back
 on
 buybacks,
 dividends,
 or


capex,
 right?
 And
 and
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 balanced
 in
 terms
 of
 that.
 And
 so,


I
 feel
 like
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 going
 to


do
 well


are
 the
 ones
 that
 are going
 to
 be
 able


to
 invest
 through
 the
 cycle
 and
 navigate


that
 to
 the
 best
 of
 their
 ability.
 I


think
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 who
 has


the
 best
 management
 in
 the
 next
 two
 to


three
 years
 and
 and
 who
 to
 really
 stick


to.
 Uh
 because
 I
 think
 times
 will
 get


Did
 I
 lose
 you?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 you're
 good.
 You're
 good.


>> Okay,
 good.


>> You
 got
 me.
 Yeah.
 You
 said
 times
 will


get
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 choppy
 and
 like


the
 best
 management
 teams
 ultimately
 are


the
 ones
 you
 want
 to
 bet
 on.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 100%.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 I I


think
 these
 these
 max
 seven
 companies,


not
 all
 of
 them
 are
 turning
 at
 the
 most


attractive
 multiples,
 but
 nonetheless,


these
 are
 the
 most
 important
 companies


in
 the
 world,
 and
 the
 modes
 that
 they


have
 are
 just
 unbelievably
 strong.
 And


so
 I've
 been
 thinking
 a
 lot
 about
 what


2026
 looks
 like
 and
 I'm
 getting
 closer


and
 closer
 to
 the
 conclusion
 that
 yes,


there
 are
 some
 plays
 you
 want
 to
 get


into
 that
 are
 high
 risk,
 high
 reward,


which
 you
 know,
 Rock
 Lab
 Houndry
 Hood


have
 been
 for
 for
 us.
 But
 to
 sleep


better
 at
 night
 DCing
 into
 Microsoft,


even
 if
 it
 doesn't
 move
 like
 crazy,
 is


just
 not
 horrible.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


that's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 to
 uh
 to


think
 about
 more
 deeply.
 Uh
 Amazon,
 so
 I


want
 to
 give
 you
 your
 flowers
 here.
 you


have
 been
 preaching
 the
 Amazon
 thesis


for
 a
 long
 time
 even
 though
 no
 one
 has


listened
 as
 much
 as
 uh
 as
 recently
 now


that
 you
 got
 the
 results.
 Google
 you


were
 preaching
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 a
 lot


more
 people
 took
 advantage
 of
 that.
 Why


do
 you
 think
 Amazon
 was
 able
 to
 surprise


the
 street
 as
 well
 as
 they
 did?
 Well,
 I


think
 the
 the
 ease
 of
 Amazon
 was
 kind
 of


easy
 to
 tell
 because,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


first
 and
 foremost,
 I
 think
 some
 people


are
 saying
 they're
 pointing
 to
 the


anthropic
 net
 gain
 on
 paper
 and
 they're


saying,
 "Oh,
 you
 know,
 they
 shouldn't


have
 been
 warded."
 And
 but
 you're
 seeing


an
 acceleration
 AWS
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was


inevitable,
 right?
 You're
 increasing


capital
 expenditure
 to
 over
 hundred


billion
 dollars
 in
 the
 trailing
 12


months.
 So
 that
 obviously
 should
 flow


through
 a
 little
 bit
 considering
 I
 think


they
 were
 only
 spending
 50
 billion
 you


know
 just
 a
 few
 years
 ago.
 So
 in
 terms


of
 capital
 expenditure
 that
 should


hopefully
 increase
 the
 the
 acceleration


of
 of
 AWS


um
 revenue
 growth
 on
 a
 topline
 basis.


So,
 but
 I
 think
 in
 other
 pieces
 is
 that


the
 valuation
 for
 Amazon
 has
 continued


to
 contract
 for
 quite
 some
 time.
 Like


it's
 trading
 at
 a
 a
 price
 to
 earnings


multiple
 similar
 to
 uh
 or
 less
 than


Google
 and
 and
 so
 in
 that
 respect
 I


think
 there
 there
 is
 no
 forward
 growth


assumed
 for
 Amazon
 in
 my
 opinion.
 If


they
 if
 you
 were
 to
 look
 at
 a
 quality


business
 like
 Amazon,
 even
 if
 it's
 just


growing
 at
 a
 at
 a
 decent
 pace
 of
 5
 to


10%
 a
 year,
 you
 should
 be
 giving
 it
 a
 uh


you
 know,
 easily
 at
 20x
 to
 25x
 multiple


because
 of
 the
 premium
 number
 one


business.
 You're
 number
 one
 in


e-commerce,
 you're
 number
 one
 in
 in


cloud,
 you're
 growing
 advertising


business.
 What
 else
 aren't
 they
 doing


that's
 you
 know
 they
 have
 a
 premier
 uh


video
 on
 demand
 platform.
 So
 to
 me


that's
 a
 premium
 business,
 right?
 if
 if


Coca-Cola
 can
 trade
 at
 22x
 on
 a
 on
 a


historical
 basis,
 why
 shouldn't
 Amazon?


And
 so,
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 this
 floor
 and


and
 to
 me
 it
 was
 just
 like,
 well,


eventually
 they're
 going
 to
 break
 out


from
 that
 floor
 because
 of
 the
 great


cash
 flow
 and
 and
 the
 uh
 the
 great


opportunity
 that
 they
 still
 have
 with


AWS.
 And
 to
 me,
 it's
 a
 margin
 story.
 And


you
 heard
 Andy
 Jasse
 talk
 about
 it
 uh
 on


the
 call
 himself.
 He
 was
 like,
 look,


because
 of
 culture,
 we're
 making
 sure


that
 we're
 making
 things
 the
 most


efficient
 as
 possible,
 right?
 and
 that's


why
 they're
 laying
 off
 the
 employees


that
 they
 are.
 And
 that
 just
 goes
 to


show
 like
 that
 margins
 are
 a
 big


important
 piece
 to
 them.
 And
 so
 you


start
 doing
 some
 mathematics
 and
 you


say,
 well,
 they're
 not
 done
 growing.


They're
 going
 to
 be
 at
 a
 trillion
 and
 a


half
 dollars
 of
 revenue
 here
 pretty


soon.
 If
 they
 get
 that
 to
 a
 25%


operating
 margin,
 I
 mean,
 the
 ops
 cash


that's
 going
 to
 be
 flown
 off
 on
 that
 is


is
 going
 to
 be
 monumental.
 And
 uh


that'll
 be,
 you
 know,
 close
 to
 to
 $400


billion.
 you
 throw
 a
 25x
 multiple
 on


that,
 there's
 no
 reason
 why
 this
 company


should
 be
 trading
 at
 $6
 trillion
 in
 the


next
 couple
 years.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 um,
 and
 then
 you
 give
 it
 a
 little


bit
 more
 runway.
 There's
 no
 reason
 why


it
 shouldn't
 be
 at
 a
 $10
 trillion
 market


cap
 valuation.


>> So,
 to
 me,
 it
 it
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 a


no-brainer.
 Um,
 that
 whole
 time
 it
 was


oscillating
 between
 2022
 and
 now.


>> Yeah.
 You
 were
 buying
 at
 like
 85


basically
 859.


>> Yeah.
 unfor
 you
 know
 fortunately


unfortunately
 during
 that
 dip
 um
 that
 we


had
 in
 late
 22
 when
 everyone
 else
 bought


Meta
 I
 bought
 I
 bought
 Amazon


>> so
 um
 you
 know
 I
 bought
 Amazon
 and


Google
 and
 Google
 turned
 out
 a
 good


decent
 run
 for
 me
 but
 Amazon
 not
 as
 much


but
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 lost
 money


or
 anything
 but
 you
 know
 I
 could
 have


made
 a
 lot
 more
 investing
 in
 something


like
 Meta
 but
 to
 me
 you
 know
 I
 just


think
 that


Amazon's
 just
 a
 no-brainer
 of
 a
 stock


going
 into
 into
 2030
 and
 beyond.


>> Are
 you
 at
 all
 interested
 in
 Meta
 now


with
 a
 15%
 dip?


>> I
 am
 now
 a
 shareholder
 of
 one
 share.
 Um,


you
 inspired
 me.
 I
 saw
 you
 buy
 your
 I


don't
 know
 how
 many
 shares
 you
 bought.


Not
 important,
 but
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know


what?
 I
 need
 to
 be
 involved.
 And
 I


always
 do
 that.


>> You
 put
 you
 bought
 it
 on
 Robin
 Hood.


Yeah,
 I
 remember.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um
 I
 I've
 started
 to
 do
 that


more
 recently.
 Stocks
 that
 intrigue
 me


that
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 following
 out
 of


this
 buy
 a
 share
 of.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 I'm
 excited
 to
 see
 it


continue
 to
 drop
 because
 my
 fear
 was


that
 it
 was
 just
 going
 to
 go
 back
 above


700
 and
 I
 will
 never
 get
 an
 opportunity.


And
 so
 I
 think
 I
 actually
 might
 start
 a


small,
 you
 know,
 couple
 hundred
 bucks


every
 paycheck
 sort
 of
 thing
 um
 on
 it.


>> Get
 rich,
 get
 rich
 or
 die
 trying.
 Get


rich
 or
 die
 trying.


>> No,
 but
 that
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 the
 motto
 of


uh
 definitely
 your
 life.
 Get
 rich
 or
 die


trying.
 Is
 it
 more
 so
 because
 of
 the


drop
 or
 is
 it
 because
 it's
 a
 hyperscaler


and
 you
 know
 that
 no
 one's
 replicating


meta?


>> The
 thing
 that
 I'm
 actually
 most
 bullish


about
 and
 it's
 actually
 a
 video
 I
 made.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 was
 I
 think
 it
 was


when
 I
 was
 still
 in
 my
 old
 apartment
 so


it
 must
 have
 been
 in
 2022.
 I
 was
 very


bullish
 when
 the
 company
 changed
 from


Facebook
 to
 Meta.


>> And
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we
 fully
 grasp


even
 though
 it's
 still
 losing
 a
 crap
 ton


of
 money.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we
 fully


grasp
 what
 Reality
 Labs
 will
 do
 in
 the


future.
 And
 I
 um
 I
 think
 that
 that
 will


play
 a
 huge
 piece
 into
 how
 things


operate.
 And
 I
 think
 you're
 starting
 to


see
 it
 come
 through.
 I
 think
 people


originally
 were
 saying
 that
 Google
 Glass


was
 too
 ahead
 of
 its
 time.
 But
 now
 you


look
 at
 metag
 glasses
 and
 and
 people
 are


a
 little
 bit
 more
 receptive
 to
 it,
 even


though
 some
 people
 still
 poke
 fun.
 But
 I


think
 that
 they're
 on
 to
 something.
 And


I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 uh
 it
 hopefully


it'll
 be
 able
 to
 um
 flow
 through
 and


it'll
 work
 out
 for
 them.
 For
 now,


Reality
 Labs
 has
 kind
 of
 just
 been
 a
 a


dumpster
 fire
 of
 innovation
 and


eventually
 something
 will
 stick
 in
 my


thoughts.
 But
 overall,
 um
 I
 don't
 know.


I'm
 I'm
 cautiously
 optimistic.
 It's
 a


great
 business.
 It'll
 continue
 to
 do


well.
 Threads
 has
 caught
 on
 more
 than
 I


thought.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 it
 died
 out
 for
 a


little
 bit.
 It
 got
 really
 hyped
 up


initially
 and
 then
 it
 kind
 of
 died
 out


and


>> it
 kind
 of
 found
 its
 wave
 again.
 So,
 um


you
 know,
 and
 I
 think
 Mark,
 I
 don't


think
 people
 give
 him
 enough
 credit.
 He


is
 a
 he's
 a
 wartime
 CEO.
 You
 know,
 as


much
 hate
 as
 he
 gets,
 he
 just
 shrugs
 it


off
 and
 keeps
 building.
 Love
 him
 or
 hate


him,
 you
 have
 to
 admit.
 I
 mean,
 he's


built
 a
 phenomenal
 company
 in
 the
 last


20
 years.


The
 fact
 that
 Met
 is
 only
 up
 8%
 now
 year


to
 date,
 I'm
 just
 seeing
 that
 is
 crazy


because
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 why
 a
 lot
 of


people
 bought
 Amazon,
 right?
 It
 was


barely
 up
 year
 to
 date
 and
 they
 thought


that
 didn't
 make
 sense.
 So,
 uh
 the


market
 giveth,
 the
 market
 taketh
 away,


but
 as
 we
 get
 in
 towards
 the
 end
 of the


year,
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 market


definitely
 taking
 away
 some
 of
 those


gains
 from
 Meta.
 Yes,
 monetization


coming
 as
 well,
 which
 I
 mean
 I
 use


WhatsApp.
 Do
 you
 use
 WhatsApp
 every
 day?


>> Every
 day.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 never
 really


used
 WhatsApp
 before
 I
 moved


internationally
 and
 then
 when
 I
 moved


internationally
 obviously
 um
 you
 know


you
 don't
 have
 the
 normal
 US
 um
 sort
 of


towers
 and
 everything
 and
 they
 charge


you
 extra
 to
 text
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.


So,
 I
 just
 always
 started
 doing
 texting


and
 everything
 off
 Wi-Fi
 from
 from


WhatsApp.
 And
 then
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 stuck


like
 to
 keep
 in
 touch
 with
 some
 of
 my


international
 friends.
 And
 um
 now
 that


my
 life
 and
 business
 is
 slightly
 more


international,
 it
 just
 makes
 sense.
 Like


I'm
 texting
 with
 people
 from
 Australia,


New
 Zealand,
 London,
 you
 know,
 Trinidad


still,
 uh
 you
 know,
 so
 it
 just
 doesn't


make
 sense
 to
 use
 typical


typical
 means
 of
 of
 text
 messaging.


Are
 you
 happy
 that
 Rock
 Lab
 is


consolidating?
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 people


want
 to
 see
 this
 go
 to
 100,
 but
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 pretty
 healthy
 for
 it
 to
 pull


back
 from
 70
 and
 make
 room
 in
 the
 60s.


Do
 you
 think
 that
 makes
 sense?
 And
 do


you
 think
 it
 can
 get
 back
 above
 alltime


highs
 on
 earnings?


>> I
 think
 so.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to


make
 a
 wild
 prediction
 um
 because
 I


think
 earnings
 is
 next
 week.
 Uh
 I
 got
 to


figure
 out
 my
 earnings
 times
 because


I'll
 be
 in
 the
 UK,
 so
 I
 might
 be
 doing


some
 of
 this
 stuff
 like
 late
 at
 night.


Um,
 but
 uh
 the


I'm
 okay
 with
 it.
 I
 I'm
 okay.
 Um,
 I


actually
 just
 rolled
 I
 had
 some
 $85


covered
 calls.
 I
 moved
 them
 to
 the
 end


of
 next
 month
 at
 $100
 and
 I
 made
 like
 a


$60
 or
 60
 cent
 spread
 and
 as
 you
 guys


can
 assume,
 I
 have
 some
 decent
 shares,


right?
 So,
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 Um,
 so
 I'm
 just
 pocketing
 that.


I'm
 not
 buying
 more
 shares,
 but
 I
 think


I'll
 have
 a
 buy
 set
 for
 Monday
 or


something
 because
 I
 have
 my
 normal,
 you


know,
 buy,
 but
 like
 you
 stated,
 I
 I


think
 we're
 a
 little
 bit
 rich
 in
 terms


of
 where
 we
 are
 today,
 right?
 In
 terms


of
 what
 the
 company
 is
 valued
 at
 today


versus
 what
 they're
 delivering
 today
 is


obviously
 overvalued,
 but
 it
 goes
 back


to
 kind
 of
 like
 how
 we
 look
 at


Palanteer,
 right?
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


potential
 Rocket
 Lab
 could
 be,
 you
 know,


my
 thought
 process
 is
 is
 it'll


eventually
 be
 a
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


company.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we've
 heard


enough
 about
 constellation
 that
 they're


going
 to
 be
 releasing.
 So
 you
 have


Amazon
 Kyper
 releasing
 a
 constellation.


You
 have
 a
 releasing
 constellation.
 You


have
 um
 Starlink
 obviously
 which
 has


done
 extremely
 well.
 So
 you
 start
 to


think
 how
 much
 revenue
 per
 satellite


those
 things
 are
 bringing
 in.
 If
 Rocket


Lab
 is
 able
 to
 replicate
 something
 like


that
 and
 distribute
 their
 own


satellites,
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 in


a
 phenomenal
 position
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make


a
 lot
 of
 gross
 margin
 off
 of
 that.
 Um,


so
 I
 don't
 think
 you've
 heard
 heard
 the


end
 of
 that.
 But
 I
 personally
 would
 love


the
 stock
 to
 consolidate.
 Um,
 even


further
 back
 into
 the
 40s,
 50s,
 but
 I


know
 unfortunately


people
 think
 like,
 oh,
 Matt's
 got


covered
 calls
 and
 he
 needs
 are


underwater
 or
 something.
 It's
 like,
 no,


this
 is
 like
 I
 want
 to
 own
 as
 much
 of


this
 company
 as
 I
 can,
 and
 I
 don't
 own


enough.
 So
 in
 that
 respect,
 I
 just,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that
 this
 is
 a
 great


company
 and
 and
 buying
 it
 at
 a
 $20


billion
 market
 cap
 valuation
 allows
 me


to
 buy
 much
 more
 percentage
 of
 the
 the


company
 on
 a
 on
 a
 buy
 basis.


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about


conviction.
 Beautiful
 thing
 about


conviction
 is
 that
 when
 you
 actually


know
 what
 you're
 holding,
 which
 I'm
 not


saying
 every
 stock
 I
 get
 into
 I
 like


fully
 have
 the
 type
 of
 conviction
 that


is
 necessary
 for
 like
 a
 a
 Rocket
 Lab


situation
 like
 you,
 but
 once
 you
 do,
 you


just
 don't
 care.
 You
 just
 don't
 because


unless
 the
 thesis
 breaks
 which
 again
 if


these
 are
 phenomenal
 companies
 they
 will


have
 bad
 quarters
 they
 might
 even
 have


bad
 years
 but
 for
 them
 to
 have
 a
 thesis


breaking
 moment
 is
 is
 going
 to
 be
 tough


and
 it's
 possible
 but
 if
 that
 doesn't


happen
 then
 you
 buy
 the
 dip
 and
 you
 know


you
 tend
 to
 be
 rewarded
 if
 you
 are
 able


to
 do
 that.
 Um
 how
 do
 you
 feel
 the
 year


has
 gone
 for
 you
 in
 general?
 Not
 just


stock
 market
 portfolio
 performance
 but
 I


mean
 it's
 been
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 year.


Obviously
 the
 stock
 market
 going
 up


definitely
 helps,
 but
 how
 do
 you
 feel


2025
 is
 wrapping
 up
 for
 you
 as
 a
 person?


>> Uh
 it's
 gone
 so
 well
 that
 I'm
 actually


having
 growing
 pains,
 you
 know.
 Um
 it's


like
 uh
 I
 didn't
 think
 I
 would
 get
 to


this
 level
 of
 monetary
 uh
 success
 as


fast
 as
 I
 have.
 And
 so
 I'm
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 like,
 okay,
 say
 half
 of
 it


goes
 away
 tomorrow,
 which
 is
 always


possible,
 right?
 You
 could
 always
 have
 a


market
 retracement.
 And
 um
 I'm
 wondering


it's
 like
 well
 what
 what
 is
 my
 next


path?
 Um
 and


you
 know
 I'm
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what


do
 I
 do
 next?
 I
 like
 working
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 it
 seems
 like
 I
 could
 be
 doing


more
 to
 help
 people
 in
 the
 community.
 We


have
 a
 beautiful
 community
 here.
 Um
 and


and
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 Miami
 really


opened
 my
 eyes
 to
 that
 to
 see
 how
 many


people
 have
 really
 been
 benefiting
 by
 us


contributing
 and
 feeding
 that
 community


you
 know
 on
 a
 on
 a
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 So,


it's
 like
 I'm
 stuck
 between
 a
 rock
 and
 a


hard
 place,
 man.
 I
 really
 am.
 Like,
 and


it's
 and
 it's
 not
 a
 bad
 thing.
 I'm
 not


depressed
 by
 it
 in
 any
 means,
 but
 it
 it


messes
 with
 your
 brain
 a
 little
 bit.


It's
 like
 I'm
 doing
 so
 well
 in
 my
 career


and
 I
 have
 such
 a
 great
 career
 ahead
 of


me.
 I
 look
 up
 and
 I'm
 like,
 I
 could


continue.
 Um,
 and
 then
 at
 the
 other
 end,


you're
 just
 like,
 well,
 I
 have
 this
 also


thing
 like
 you
 could
 see
 the
 end
 of


that,
 right?
 You
 can
 kind
 of
 quantify.


Sorry,
 this
 is
 getting
 super
 like


existential,
 but
 it's
 the
 truth.
 It's


like
 you
 can
 see
 where
 that
 ends,
 right?


And
 and
 where
 I
 could
 potentially
 go
 and


then
 you
 see
 this
 other
 side
 where
 it's


like
 I
 see
 you
 ex
 excelling
 so
 much
 and


Tanner
 excelling
 so
 much.
 And
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 living
 on
 your
 own
 time


because
 you
 still
 have
 a
 market
 and


market
 close,
 market
 open
 and
 close


every
 day,
 but
 in
 between
 those
 times,


you
 can
 read
 or
 do
 whatever.
 It's
 it's


just
 an
 interesting
 different
 lifestyle


that
 I've
 never
 thought
 I
 could
 live.


And
 I
 see
 myself
 potentially
 getting


closer
 and
 closer
 to
 something
 like
 that


and
 seeing
 Steve
 start,
 you
 know,
 it's


really
 inspiring
 me.
 But
 overall,
 man,


the
 the
 market
 is
 been
 really
 good
 for


me.
 It's
 allowed
 me
 to
 focus
 a
 little


bit
 more
 on
 my
 health.
 So,
 I'm
 trying
 to


get
 that
 in
 order.
 Um,
 obviously,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 journey
 um
 that
 I


have
 to
 have
 to
 to
 face
 on
 that
 end,
 but


um
 things
 are
 going
 in
 the
 right


direction
 with
 that.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 the


to
 me
 it's
 more
 about
 optimization
 of


figuring
 out
 what
 what
 the
 next
 steps


are
 because
 in
 order
 to
 break
 through


the
 numbers
 show
 up
 after
 you've
 gotten


to
 a
 certain
 mindset,
 right?
 So,
 and


this
 is
 for
 anybody
 listening
 and
 you


can
 shut
 me
 off
 and
 redirect
 me
 if
 you


want,
 but
 I
 often
 tell
 people
 they're


like,
 "Ah,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 millionaire."


And
 I'm
 like,
 "Well,
 are
 you
 are
 you


acting
 like
 a
 millionaire?"
 Like,
 you


have
 to
 act
 like
 a
 millionaire
 and
 think


like
 a
 millionaire
 before
 the
 numbers


show
 up,


>> right?
 You
 have
 to
 make
 millionaire


decisions.
 Like
 you
 can't
 be
 managing


money
 like
 you
 have
 a hundred
 bucks.
 You


have
 to
 be
 managing
 money
 or
 thinking
 in


in
 a
 way
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 get
 to
 that


point.
 Um


just
 like
 you
 know
 to
 get
 better
 at


baseball,
 right?
 Or
 like
 better
 at
 at at


uh
 anything
 like
 you
 can't
 just
 put
 in


baby
 amounts
 of
 time.
 Like
 you
 have
 to


put
 in
 real
 effort,
 real
 time,
 make
 the


right
 decisions,
 and
 eventually
 your


skills
 will
 will
 catch
 up.
 And
 so
 I'm


trying
 to
 think
 like
 in
 order
 to
 get
 to


that
 next
 level,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,


eight
 figures
 beyond,
 it's
 like,
 am
 I


making
 the
 right
 decisions?
 Am
 I
 going


in
 the
 right
 direction?
 Am
 I
 holding


myself
 back?
 Um,
 so
 anyway,
 that
 might


be
 too
 much
 of
 a
 philosophical.


>> Well,
 no,
 that
 that's
 why
 look,
 it's
 the


last
 day
 of
 October.
 That's
 why
 I
 asked


the
 question.
 I
 mean,
 like
 it's


important
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


look,
 the
 good
 thing
 about
 a
 bull
 market


year
 is
 it
 gives
 you
 the
 the
 privilege


to
 even
 think
 like
 that,
 right?
 because


you
 obviously
 need
 to
 have
 that
 level
 of


financial
 independence
 and
 freedom
 or
 at


least
 being
 close
 to
 it
 to
 get
 you
 to


think
 of
 like
 what
 is
 on
 the
 other
 side


of
 life.
 Um,
 and
 living
 on
 your
 own


terms
 and
 all
 that
 stuff
 and
 like
 it's


not
 easy
 to
 do
 stock
 market
 going
 up
 and


being
 invested
 in
 the
 best
 companies
 in


the
 world
 really
 helps
 which
 goes
 back


to
 this
 bifurcation
 of
 the
 economy


argument.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 also
 like
 you


only
 have
 one
 life,
 right?
 So
 why


wouldn't
 you
 why
 wouldn't
 you
 start


having
 those
 thoughts
 especially
 as
 you


get
 into
 your
 30s
 and
 just
 start


thinking
 of
 like
 and
 I'm
 getting
 into
 my


30s
 soon.
 So
 it's
 like
 these
 are
 things


that
 are
 really
 really
 important
 I
 think


to
 deeply
 think
 about
 and
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 you're
 about
 them.


>> Someone
 says
 never
 get
 married.


>> Yeah.
 We're
 going to
 see
 if
 if
 you
 do


get
 married
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 need
 to
 be
 at


the
 wedding.
 That's
 for
 sure.


>> You'll
 probably
 officiate
 it.
 You're


very
 you're
 very
 articulate.
 So


>> there
 you
 go.
 Dude,
 I
 definitely
 Dude,
 I


I
 should
 look
 into
 that
 business
 of


officiating
 weddings.
 Like


>> I
 think
 you
 got
 enough
 on
 your
 plate.


But
 I
 I'm
 sure
 some
 people
 in
 the


audience
 would
 love
 you
 to
 officiate


their
 wedding.


>> There's
 no
 way
 I
 wouldn't
 crush
 being
 an


MC
 at
 a
 wedding.
 Dude,
 like
 that
 would


be
 elite


elite
 elite
 to
 that.
 All right,
 so
 um
 I


think
 let's
 end
 it
 out
 with
 just
 some


Q&A
 for
 the
 past
 10
 minutes.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 Steve
 will
 be
 able
 to
 be
 on.


He's
 in
 a
 work
 call.
 He
 might
 be
 able
 to


make
 it,
 might
 not.
 But
 uh
 we
 got
 10
 15


more
 minutes
 left.
 If
 anyone
 has
 any


questions
 for
 Matty
 Money,
 put
 them
 in


the
 chat.
 Yes,


>> Tanner.


I
 will
 definitely
 be
 mcing
 your
 wedding


if
 you
 ever
 get
 married,
 Tanner.
 Um,


but
 yes.
 So,
 any
 questions
 in
 the
 chat,


put
 them
 here.
 Stock
 market
 related,


could
 be
 life
 related,
 whatever
 it
 is.


It
 could
 be
 for
 me,
 Matt,
 as
 well.
 And


>> damn,
 100K
 wedding.
 Yeah,
 I
 didn't
 think


about
 that.
 You
 probably
 could
 make
 100K


wedding.
 Like,
 here's
 my
 YouTube


channel.
 And
 be
 like,
 I
 I
 charge
 a
 lot,


you
 know?
 And
 they'd
 be
 like,
 whatever.


It's
 okay,


>> dude.
 There's
 no
 way
 they
 pay
 the
 MC
 a h


100,000.
 That's
 like


if
 they
 did.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 maybe
 if


someone's
 funny,
 that
 one
 that
 one
 plays


out.
 Um,


>> jokes
 are
 good.
 Your
 jokes
 are
 good.


>> Broad
 2026
 strategies.
 Is
 it
 just
 big


tech
 or
 is
 there
 anything
 specific


you're
 thinking
 of?


>> Um,


oil
 and
 gas.
 I
 know
 that's
 your


expertise.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 I'm I'm
 still
 dabbling


in
 that.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 I
 have
 some
 buys.


Uh
 just
 because
 the
 I
 don't
 know
 why


it's
 the
 31st,
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 all


my
 buys
 aren't
 going
 in
 today.
 Um


yeah,
 so
 I've
 have
 some
 normal
 buys
 that


I
 have
 on
 a
 bi-weekly
 basis
 every
 time
 I


get
 paid
 that
 go
 into
 some
 oil
 and
 gas.


Um


some
 sharebased
 compensation
 that's


coming
 in
 today,
 which
 it
 hasn't
 in
 my


account
 yet,
 so
 I'm
 pretty
 flustered


with
 that,
 but
 hopefully
 by
 Monday
 it'll


come
 in.
 Um
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I'm
 trying


to
 understand
 exactly
 the
 same.
 Right.
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 26
 will
 be
 a


bad
 year
 in
 the
 first
 half.
 I
 think


second
 half
 it
 might
 see
 some
 some


turmoil
 just
 because
 I
 think
 that
 we'll


start
 to
 see
 the
 runway
 end
 slightly
 for


for
 big
 tech
 in
 terms
 of
 capex
 growth


and
 everything
 like
 that.
 But
 with


that's
 going
 to
 come
 a
 lot
 of
 income


because
 everybody's
 been
 throwing
 so


much
 money.
 So
 I'm
 like
 stuck
 between
 a


rock
 and
 a
 hard
 place.
 is
 like,
 okay,


yes,
 they
 might
 get
 their
 hand
 slapped


for
 having
 to
 reset
 their
 capital


expenditure,
 etc.,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,


they're
 going
 to
 be
 generating
 so
 much


more
 income.
 It's
 I'm
 curious
 to
 see
 how


it
 pans
 out,
 but
 to
 me,


um,
 just
 continuing
 to
 buy
 every
 every


other
 week,
 every
 time
 I
 get
 a
 paycheck,


and
 um
 I
 don't
 know,
 looking
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 next
 decade
 in
 Venture


Global
 going
 into
 26.
 I
 think
 that


that'll
 be
 an
 interesting
 one.
 Um,
 I'm


continuing
 to
 buy.
 Next
 decade,
 I
 bought


some
 more
 yesterday.
 I
 bought
 some
 more


Venture
 Global
 yesterday.
 Um,
 or
 maybe


it
 was
 today.
 Either
 one.
 Um,
 I
 just


woke
 up
 and
 I
 was
 just
 double-checking


my
 spreadsheets
 and
 my
 accounts
 and


cross-checking
 everything
 and
 I
 saw
 that


I
 had
 more.
 Um,


yeah,
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 100%
 certain
 for


26
 yet.
 That's
 tough.
 Um,


>> yeah,


>> I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 think
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 best
 ideas
 could


still
 continue
 to
 do
 well,
 but
 there's


gonna
 have
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


understanding
 of
 how
 this
 year
 ends
 to


figure
 out
 what
 happens
 in
 26.


>> I
 will
 say
 uh
 the
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 I


did
 start
 to
 do
 in
 the
 background
 and


it's
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 conversation
 I


had
 about
 Amazon
 and
 maybe
 I
 encourage


people
 to
 do
 this
 as
 well.


>> Things
 have
 moved
 such
 a
 in
 such
 a
 good


direction
 for
 me
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


that
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 targets
 have
 been
 hit


faster.
 And
 so
 one
 of the
 things
 right


before
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 you
 and
 I
 was


being
 inspired
 as
 I
 always
 am
 when
 I


listen
 to
 you,
 I
 went
 into
 my


spreadsheet
 and
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 how
 many


shares
 of
 each
 of
 these
 companies
 do
 I


need
 to
 get
 to
 to
 get
 to
 my
 next
 goal?"


And
 so
 I
 did
 it
 for
 Amazon,
 but
 I
 have


all
 these,
 you
 know,
 these
 other
 six
 or


seven
 positions
 that
 I
 have
 that
 I'm


adding
 to.
 You
 know,
 what
 what
 number
 do


I
 need
 to
 get
 for
 that?
 Rocket
 Lab's


relatively
 filled
 out
 if
 it
 gets
 to
 my


uh
 um
 to
 my
 uh
 where
 I
 think
 it'll
 get


to,
 but
 maybe
 I
 should
 build
 in
 a
 margin


of
 safety.
 Like,
 oh,
 what
 if
 it
 only


gets
 to
 80
 billion
 instead
 of
 100?
 You


know,
 do
 I
 still
 get
 to
 that
 X
 number


of,
 you
 know,
 dollar
 value?
 But
 I
 went


through
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 man,
 like
 so
 for


example,


um,
 prime
 example,
 because
 it's


literally
 just
 filling
 this
 out,
 is
 for


Palunteer,
 I'm
 only
 76%
 filled
 on
 my


total
 allocation
 for
 that.
 Amazon,
 I'm


only
 63%
 filled.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 have
 633


shares
 of
 that.
 I
 would
 like
 to
 get
 um


close
 to
 a
 thousand.
 We
 talked
 about


next
 decade,
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 than


half.
 Uh,
 Venture
 Global,
 I'm
 a
 little


less
 than
 or
 I'm
 I'm
 at
 like
 33%.


Google,
 I'm
 at
 like
 33%,
 Rocket
 Lab,
 I'm


at
 like
 82%.
 Um,
 and
 I
 might
 do
 that
 for


some
 of
 my
 other
 stocks,
 but
 it's
 like
 I


basically
 have
 where
 I
 think
 the
 stocks


will
 get
 to
 in
 terms
 of
 valuation
 and


what
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to.
 So,
 for
 example,


Amazon,
 I
 said
 10
 trillion
 is
 where
 I


want
 to
 get
 to.
 I
 want
 it
 to
 be
 a


million
 dollar
 position.
 You
 know,
 I


needed
 to
 get
 to
 $1,000
 a
 share
 pretty


much.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 well
 I


have
 633.
 Divide
 that
 by
 a th00and


that's
 63%.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to
 100%."
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 how
 I'm
 looking
 at


things.
 Like
 I
 would
 like
 to
 get
 my


stocks
 up
 to
 So
 if
 they
 do
 hit
 that,


like
 I
 think
 Next
 is
 going
 to
 hit
 20


billion.
 Let's
 say
 I
 want,
 you
 know,
 a


million
 dollars
 worth
 of
 Next
 or


something
 like
 that.
 I
 need
 this
 many


shares
 to
 get
 to
 that.
 Um
 that's
 that's


how
 I'm
 evaluating
 it.
 So
 once
 it's


fully
 valued
 at
 a
 million
 dollars,
 I


need
 this
 many
 shares.
 Otherwise,
 I'll


I'll
 miss
 it.
 And
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 be


wrong,
 right?
 People
 are
 going
 to
 dilute


share
 count.
 They'll
 buy
 back
 shares,
 so


maybe
 it'll
 even
 be
 easier.
 But
 the
 hope


is
 is
 at
 least
 you
 have
 some
 sort
 of


goal
 that
 you
 can
 achieve
 and
 and
 look


after.


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 think


about
 it.
 We
 were
 talking
 about
 this
 in


the
 morning,
 but
 just
 having
 your
 own


mental
 framework
 on
 how
 you
 navigate


position
 building,
 position
 sizing.
 I


mean,
 someone
 asked
 like,
 "Hey,
 I
 feel


like
 we're
 getting
 toppy.
 What
 should
 I


It's
 like,
 well,
 if
 you
 feel
 that
 way,


then
 mentally,
 how
 can
 you
 come
 to
 a


sense
 of
 peace?
 One
 of
 the
 easiest
 ways


is
 take
 some
 profits.
 You
 know,
 there


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 to


navigate
 how
 you
 think
 about
 the
 current


state
 of
 the
 markets
 and
 the
 economy.


But
 having
 your
 own
 subjective
 view
 of


the
 world
 and
 then
 taking
 from
 other


people,
 but
 having
 conviction
 in
 your


opinion,
 which
 is
 that
 Amazon
 will
 get


to
 a
 thousand
 bucks,
 so
 you
 need
 those


thousand
 shares,
 it
 makes
 it
 easier
 to


just
 continue
 buying
 and
 holding.
 Um,


someone
 said
 you
 said
 you
 have
 to
 think


like
 a
 millionaire
 before
 you
 are
 a


millionaire.
 any
 I
 guess
 quick
 ideas
 on


how
 you
 manifested
 that
 idea?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean


listen
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 smart
 people,
 man.


Like
 a
 lot
 of
 motivational
 speeches.


Mostly
 you.
 No,
 I'm
 just
 kidding.
 Uh
 but


no,
 but
 um
 in
 all
 seriousness,


>> it's
 usually
 Steve.


>> Yeah,
 usually
 Steve.
 But
 no,
 I
 mean
 in


all
 seriousness,
 it's
 like
 it's
 just


through
 learning
 things,
 right?
 Like


just
 having
 experience
 in
 the
 market.


like
 you
 can't
 expect
 to
 become
 a
 master


at
 something
 if
 you
 don't
 start
 to
 move


in
 a
 certain
 direction,
 right?
 Um
 you


really
 have
 to
 put
 yourself
 in
 the


opportunities
 to
 to
 have
 those
 things


open
 up
 and
 you
 can
 get
 lucky,
 right?
 So


there
 is
 an
 opportunity
 where
 you
 get


lucky
 and
 and
 you
 find
 a
 train
 and
 and


it's
 able
 to
 literally
 siphon
 through


and
 and
 make
 things
 five
 times
 easier


for
 you.
 But
 I
 think
 so
 many
 times


people
 don't
 think
 of
 their
 lives
 like
 a


business.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 it's


pretty
 funny.
 Like
 I
 quote
 Jay-Z
 a
 lot.


Like
 I'm
 a
 businessman.
 Like
 it's
 the


truth,
 right?
 Like
 so
 I
 think
 so
 many


people
 are
 like,
 "I
 have
 this
 thousand.


How
 do
 I
 get
 this
 thousand
 dollars
 to
 be


a
 million?"
 It's
 like
 that's
 not
 the


right
 question,
 right?
 Like
 you
 need
 to


be
 feeding
 your
 portfolio
 every
 single


month,
 right?
 I
 always
 talk
 about
 it.


Every
 every
 other
 paycheck
 or
 like
 every


paycheck
 that
 I
 get,
 I'm
 investing
 in


the
 market.
 I'm
 not
 like
 waiting
 till
 I


get
 to
 10,000
 or
 anything
 else.
 Like
 I


have
 my
 buys.
 Luckily,
 Robin
 Hood
 makes


it
 so
 much
 easier.
 Fidelity
 makes
 it
 so


much
 easier
 than
 it
 did
 when
 I
 first


started.
 It's
 like
 I
 literally
 know
 how


much
 of
 my
 paycheck
 is
 going
 where
 and


by
 the
 end
 of
 it,
 my
 paycheck
 is


literally
 just
 enough
 or
 the
 remainder


in
 my
 checking
 account
 is
 just
 enough
 to


pay
 my
 credit
 card
 and
 my
 mortgage.


>> And
 so
 like
 that's
 the
 goal
 is
 like
 I


never
 I
 never
 want
 to
 have
 more
 than


$500
 to
 $1,000
 in
 my
 checking
 because
 I


don't
 get
 paid
 in
 my
 checking
 account.


>> So
 why
 why
 have
 why
 have
 money
 in
 my


checking
 account?
 So,
 I
 have,
 you
 know,


Robert
 Kiyosaki,
 you
 know,
 all
 these


smart
 people.
 Uh,
 Jim
 Rome,
 you
 know,
 it


doesn't
 always
 have
 to
 be
 about
 money.


Sometimes
 it's
 about
 life
 and
 and
 just


listen
 to
 everything
 and
 formulate
 your


own
 opinion.
 Understand
 your
 goals
 and


objectives
 where
 you
 want
 to
 go.
 And
 so,


like,
 that's
 just
 how
 I've
 worked
 it.


And
 I've
 learned
 a
 lot
 along
 the
 way.


Um,
 thinking
 that
 I
 was
 smarter
 than
 I


am.
 And
 um
 I'm
 sure
 somebody
 sorry
 my


washer
 and
 dryer
 are
 going
 off,
 but
 I'm


sure
 somebody
 out
 there
 is
 like
 that
 has


way
 much
 more
 money
 than
 I
 do
 that
 way


more
 experience
 on
 hand
 manage
 money
 is


um
 like
 Matt's
 an
 idiot.
 And
 they're


probably
 right,
 but
 for
 me
 it's
 worked


out
 and
 it's
 gotten
 me
 to
 a
 place
 where


I
 feel
 like
 I
 can
 start
 to
 play,
 you


know,
 the
 game
 where
 the
 high
 net
 worth


individual
 game.
 Right
 now
 I
 just
 have
 a


decent
 net
 worth,
 right?
 and
 and
 I
 want


to
 get
 to
 that
 place
 where
 it's
 like
 if


I
 want
 to
 take
 off
 and
 go
 to
 Monaco
 for


Monaco
 F1
 race,
 like
 I
 can
 do
 that,
 you


know,
 and
 not
 worry
 about
 it.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 that that
 is
 the
 privilege


of
 what
 financial
 freedom
 affords
 you.


And
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 the
 motivational


stuff
 you're
 saying
 makes
 a
 lot of


sense.
 I
 mean,
 everyone
 has
 their
 own


phases
 of
 what
 they
 listen
 to
 and
 how


they
 navigate
 motivation,
 how
 they
 think


about
 it.
 But
 like
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it's


important
 at
 some
 point
 in
 your
 life
 if


you
 want
 to
 have
 like
 a
 growth
 mindset


or
 a
 transformational
 journey.
 Feeding


your
 own
 content
 diet,
 I
 think
 is
 what


it's
 been
 called,
 is
 really
 important


because
 if
 you
 feed
 it
 with
 just


horrible
 forms
 of
 nonsense
 and
 brain


rot,
 it
 really
 is
 hard
 to
 to
 to
 be
 sane,


especially
 with
 all
 the
 different


thousands
 of
 things
 that
 are
 coming
 at


you
 every
 single
 day
 in
 regards
 to


content.
 But
 feeding
 it
 with
 this
 stuff


that
 helps
 you
 understand
 how
 to
 move


forward
 in
 life,
 which
 is
 what
 we're
 all


trying
 to
 do,
 move
 forward,
 grow,
 you


know,
 that
 stuff
 matters
 and
 it
 matters


a
 lot.
 Um,
 I
 saw
 you
 posting
 about
 Micro


Strategies
 earnings
 yesterday.
 17
 years


ago
 on
 Today,
 the
 Bitcoin
 white
 paper


came
 out.
 I
 guess
 just
 in
 general,
 do


you
 truly
 believe
 in
 Bitcoin?
 Uh,
 to
 the


extent
 that
 you
 would
 call
 yourself
 a


Bitcoin
 maxi?


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 maxi.
 I
 don't
 know.
 If
 I


was a
 Maxi,
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 wouldn't
 have


any
 stocks.
 Um,
 maybe
 that's
 not
 the
 way


it
 is.
 I
 don't know.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm


Is
 it
 really
 to
 the
 day?


>> Yeah.
 17
 years
 ago,
 October
 30th.


>> Well,
 I
 can't
 be
 a
 maxi.
 I
 don't
 even


know.
 Um,
 so


>> but
 uh


>> but
 you
 like
 Micro
 Strategy.
 You
 like


it.


>> I
 think
 it's
 an
 interesting
 one,
 right?


And
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 proxy
 for
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 with
 BMR.
 And
 I


originally
 thought
 they
 were
 a
 little


bit
 crazy.
 I
 had
 Bitcoin
 back
 in
 2020,


but
 I
 thought,
 okay,
 the
 whole
 company


being
 kind
 of
 formulated
 around
 because


it
 wasn't
 really
 a
 company
 before
 then.


Yes,
 they
 had
 some
 software
 sales
 and


they
 still
 have
 revenue
 sales
 and


everything
 like
 that,
 but
 now
 the


majority
 of
 their
 income
 is
 operated
 off


of
 the
 delta
 that
 they
 get
 between
 what


they
 buy
 Bitcoin
 at
 and
 what
 it's
 valued


at
 today.
 And
 so,
 um,
 I
 think
 their


average
 is
 like
 47,000
 or
 something
 like


that.
 So,
 now
 they're
 actually
 able
 to


kind
 of
 write
 up
 the
 the
 amount
 of
 value


that
 they
 have.
 Maybe
 it's
 70,000.
 I


don't
 remember
 per
 Bitcoin.
 But
 I
 mean,


I
 like
 it.
 It's
 something
 where
 I
 say


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 decent
 store
 of
 value


throughout
 time.
 And
 to
 me
 now,
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 seen
 me
 get
 into


this
 world
 where
 originally
 I
 was
 like,


you
 know what,
 I
 need
 to
 sell
 these


things,
 put
 them
 into
 the
 S&P
 500,
 super


secure,
 and
 it's
 like
 at
 this
 point
 I'm


looking
 for
 things
 that
 I
 know
 will
 be


good
 stewards
 of
 growth
 in
 the
 future


like
 Palanteer,
 Rocket
 Lab,
 Bitcoin
 that


I
 could
 just
 borrow
 against
 it.
 Like


Robin
 Hood
 makes
 it
 so
 easy


comparatively
 to
 a
 bank.
 Like
 no,
 I
 have


zero
 will
 to
 go
 to
 a
 bank
 and
 be
 like,


"Please
 underwrite
 me."
 So
 like
 like
 now


I'm
 just
 gonna
 be
 like,
 "Let
 me
 just


borrow
 from
 Robin
 Hood."
 Like
 they
 make


it
 so
 easy.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 just
 looking
 for


things
 like
 Bitcoin
 that
 I
 think
 will
 be


a
 great
 store.


>> And
 um
 to
 me,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


interesting.
 Like
 I
 can
 see
 the
 cycles.


I
 can
 see
 the
 supply
 demand.
 It's
 it's


very
 intriguing
 to
 me.
 And
 so
 2%
 or
 3%,


I
 forget
 what
 it
 is.
 If
 every
 paycheck
 I


get
 goes
 into
 buying
 more
 Bitcoin
 and
 my


thought
 process
 with
 that
 is
 like,
 well,


if
 it
 does
 eventually
 10x,
 then


technically
 I
 save
 30%
 of
 my
 paycheck.


Um,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 in
 that


respect.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 but,
 uh,
 but
 I
 don't know,
 the
 way
 I


look
 at
 it
 is
 is
 like
 I
 I
 could
 leverage


against
 it
 in
 the
 future.
 Same
 thing


with
 Palunteer,
 same
 thing
 with
 Rocket


Lab.
 Um,
 eventually
 those
 things
 will


pay
 dividends.
 So,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 a
 way
 that
 I
 can
 make
 money
 off
 of


my
 Bitcoin
 as
 well.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 I
 uh
 I


wish
 I
 could
 write
 covered
 calls
 on
 my


Bitcoin.
 I
 I
 can
 on
 some
 of
 it
 because


some
 of
 it
 I
 used
 I
 bought
 GBTC,


Grayscale
 Bitcoin
 Trust
 back
 in
 the
 day.


Um,
 and
 then
 that
 split
 off
 into
 just


the
 mini
 trust,
 which
 is
 a
 lot
 cheaper.


And
 so,
 I
 do
 write
 covered
 calls
 on
 that


and
 then
 generate
 some
 income
 off
 of


that.
 But,
 um,
 the
 actual
 physical


Bitcoin
 I
 hold,
 uh,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to


make
 money
 off
 of
 that.
 That's
 something


I'm
 still
 uh
 trying
 to
 figure
 out.


>> Brendan
 says,
 "Thank
 you
 for
 talking


about
 borrowing
 against
 your
 portfolio.


Everyone
 I
 talk
 to
 in
 real
 life
 is
 so


worried
 about
 it.
 It's
 a
 game
 changer


when
 done
 right."
 Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And


what
 Matt's
 saying
 right
 there
 is
 like


if
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 liquidity
 to
 do


something,
 maybe
 buy
 his
 like
 85th


house,
 uh,
 and
 you
 have
 a
 multi-million


dollar
 stock
 portfolio
 and
 margin
 rates


are
 at,
 at least
 on
 Robin
 Hood,
 four
 and


a
 half%,
 Fidelity
 maybe
 it's
 like
 6%,


whatever
 it
 is.
 Like
 you
 don't
 need
 to


go
 to
 a
 bank
 and
 they
 have
 to
 evaluate


your
 entire
 financial
 profile
 to
 say
 hey


this
 is
 the
 money
 we're
 going
 to
 give


you
 and
 this
 is
 the
 rate
 we're
 going
 to


give
 you.
 Your
 assets
 whether
 it's
 Apple


or
 Amazon
 or
 Google
 or
 Tesla
 are
 going


to
 be
 deemed
 worthy
 enough
 to
 give
 a


margin
 loan
 against
 aka
 they're
 going
 to


use
 the
 stock
 as
 collateral
 to
 give
 you


loans
 or
 they're
 not
 going to
 be
 if
 you


have
 100%
 and
 beyond
 meat
 you're
 not


going
 to
 get
 that
 much
 margin.
 But
 if


you're
 in
 the
 greatest
 companies
 in
 the


world
 like
 a
 Google
 and
 Amazon
 that
 are


continuing
 to
 execute,
 Robinet's


probably
 going
 to
 lend
 you
 uh
 a
 lot
 more


money.
 And
 so
 from
 that
 perspective,
 you


can
 leverage
 your
 own
 portfolio,
 your


own
 decision-
 making
 that
 you've
 had
 for


the
 past
 few
 years
 effectively


allocating
 into
 these
 companies
 to
 then


borrow
 money
 against
 it,
 which
 can
 be


dangerous
 if
 you
 take
 that
 money
 and
 you


go
 put
 it
 into
 zero
 DTE
 and
 then
 you're


wrong
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 back
 the


money
 and
 sell
 all
 your
 stock
 to
 pay
 it


back.
 But
 if
 you're
 doing
 it


productively,
 then
 it's
 not
 the
 worst


thing
 in
 the
 world.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think
 where


where
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people
 is
 when
 they're
 trying
 to
 borrow


like
 20%
 of
 their
 portfolio
 in
 a
 year.


It's
 like
 that's
 not
 where
 I'm
 at,


right?
 Like
 I'm
 at
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get


to
 a
 better
 place
 where
 it's,
 you
 know,


I
 can


>> get
 almost
 like
 a
 floor,
 right?
 Like
 you


should
 never
 borrow
 more
 than
 3
 to
 4%
 of


your
 entire
 portfolio.
 The
 3
 to
 4%
 rule,


if
 you've
 heard
 of
 it,
 maybe
 if
 you


haven't,
 you
 know,
 look
 into
 it.
 But


basically
 the
 thought
 process
 is
 is
 on


an
 average
 after
 inflation
 everything


like
 that
 your
 portfolio
 goes
 up
 at
 a


rate
 where
 even
 if
 it
 does
 this
 right


generally
 speaking
 over
 and
 it's
 been


back
 tested
 if
 you
 pull
 out
 4%
 you
 have


like
 an
 80%
 likelihood
 of
 never
 running


out
 of
 money.
 So,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 million-


dollar
 portfolio
 and
 you
 pull
 out
 40


grand
 a
 year,
 it'll
 yeah,
 there'll
 be


ups
 and
 downs,
 but
 eventually,
 you
 know,


over
 time
 it
 generally
 goes
 up
 and
 to


the
 right
 if
 you're
 invested
 in
 the


right
 things.
 Um,
 so
 for
 me,
 it's
 like,


you
 know,
 um,
 where
 I
 was
 two
 or
 three


years
 ago,
 I
 was
 like,
 oh
 yeah,
 I
 still


have
 to
 work
 or
 do
 something
 like
 that.


Now,
 it's
 getting
 to
 the
 point
 where
 the


portfolio
 is
 to
 an
 extent
 where
 it's


like,
 okay,
 that
 makes
 more
 sense.
 like


why
 would
 I
 sell
 and
 pay
 have
 to
 pay
 the


government
 you
 know
 the
 taxes
 associated


with
 it
 and
 I
 was
 like
 why
 would
 I
 want


to
 sell
 Rocket
 Lab
 it's
 like
 if
 I
 could


just
 borrow
 against
 it
 then
 I
 still
 get


to
 own
 it
 and
 not
 sell
 it
 nor
 do
 I
 have


to
 pay
 the
 capital
 gains
 tax
 you
 think


about
 it
 it's
 like
 if
 I
 were
 to
 sell
 my


Rocket
 Lab
 it's
 all
 it's
 all
 capital


gains
 so
 everything
 that
 I
 sell
 off
 of


it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 15
 and
 actually
 more


like
 20%
 to
 the
 government
 so


>> it's
 like
 why
 why
 do
 that
 immediately
 I


almost
 like
 a
 I
 can
 use
 part
 of
 that
 and


um
 think
 about
 it
 that
 that
 plays
 into


the
 factor
 as
 well.
 It's
 like
 I
 no


longer
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 that
 aspect


of
 it.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 if
 Rocket
 Lab


switches
 directions,
 different
 story.
 I


would
 sell
 it
 and
 but
 for
 right
 now,
 I


just
 think
 they're
 moving
 in
 the
 right


direction
 and
 firing
 on
 all
 cylinders.


So,
 same
 thing
 with
 Palanteer.
 Like,
 why


would
 I
 sell
 Pounder
 when
 it's
 still


churning
 out?
 So,


>> and
 quite
 frankly,
 this
 is
 like
 this
 is


the
 the
 secret.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 too


much
 of
 a
 secret
 anymore,
 but
 like
 most


people
 in
 the in the in the investing


community
 understand
 this
 is
 what


wealthy
 people
 do.
 They
 I
 mean
 like


Larry
 Ellison
 has
 I
 think
 sold
 less
 than


1%
 of
 his
 entire
 stake
 of
 Oracle
 for
 the


past
 50
 years.
 Like
 you
 borrow
 against


the
 assets
 and
 you
 get
 I
 mean
 look
 Larry


Ellson's
 in
 a
 different
 league,
 multiund


billionaire,
 but
 you
 get
 very
 cheap


loans
 from
 private
 lending
 companies


when
 you're
 in
 that
 league
 because
 uh


they
 want
 to
 do
 business
 with
 you
 and


you
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 when


you
 have
 access
 to
 that
 much
 capital.
 So


we're
 people
 can
 do
 it
 on
 a
 much
 smaller


stage
 at
 these
 levels
 if
 you
 do
 it


productively.
 But
 it
 is
 something
 as
 you


get
 wealthier.
 You
 know
 that
 is
 I
 guess


the
 trick
 of
 not
 having
 to
 sell
 your


assets
 ever.
 And
 you
 know
 this
 goes
 back


to
 that
 bifurcation
 of
 the
 economy


bargain.
 If
 you
 have
 been
 borrowing


against
 Nvidia
 for
 you
 know
 there's


people
 in
 the
 chat
 that
 have
 like


100,000
 Nvidia
 shares.
 Like
 why
 would


you
 sell


>> right?
 Like
 why
 would
 you
 sell
 that?


It's
 like
 no
 you
 can
 borrow
 again
 like


unless
 Nvidia
 goes
 to
 zero
 or
 Nvidia


substantially
 goes
 down
 which
 it
 did


with
 the
 deepseek
 moment.
 So
 those
 risks


are
 there.
 But
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then
 you


can
 pay
 off
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 bills
 without


having
 to
 sell
 all
 the
 stock.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 unless
 you
 think
 it's


truly
 fully
 valued
 and
 it's
 at
 risk.


Like
 say
 I
 thought
 Palanteer
 was
 only


supposed
 to
 be
 $250
 billion
 company
 and


I
 think
 what
 they're
 doing
 right
 now


they're
 they're
 running
 like
 a
 $250


billion
 company
 and
 I
 think
 their


terminal
 market
 cap
 should
 be
 $250


billion.
 It's
 like,
 well,
 why
 am
 I


holding
 it,
 right?
 It
 doesn't
 make


sense.
 But
 to
 me,
 I
 still
 think
 it's


going
 to
 grow
 to
 one
 and
 a
 half$2


trillion
 dollar
 market
 cap.
 So


>> yeah,


>> why
 why
 sell
 it?
 Pay
 the
 capital
 gains.


I
 don't
 think
 it'll
 go
 back
 to
 160
 very


easily.
 And
 if
 it
 does,
 will
 I
 have
 the


money
 on
 hand
 to
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 back
 in?


You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 That
 that's
 always


you're
 playing
 so
 many
 ifs.
 You're


stacking
 assumptions
 on
 top
 of
 each


other,
 and
 it
 just
 doesn't
 work.
 Um,
 so


I,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 very
 smart
 either,


so
 I
 try
 to
 make
 things
 as
 simple
 as


possible.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 somebody


asked
 in
 the
 chat,
 will
 I
 ever
 disclose?


I
 mean,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 what


the
 number
 is
 that
 I
 say
 that
 comes
 out


of my
 mouth.
 is
 more
 important
 is
 what


I'm
 saying
 and
 how
 it
 pertains
 to
 you


because
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 versus
 what


your
 what
 your
 life
 is
 or
 whatever
 can


be
 completely
 different.
 Um,
 and
 so
 does


>> I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 people
 get
 too


obsessed
 about
 someone's
 net
 worth
 or


how
 many
 shares
 do
 they
 have
 in
 this
 or


position
 size
 or
 all
 that
 stuff
 like


>> the
 the
 question
 is
 about
 the
 analysis


around
 a
 position,
 not
 exactly
 how
 many


shares
 or
 how
 big
 someone's
 portfolio
 is


because
 at
 that
 point
 like
 you're
 you're


looking
 for
 validation
 from
 a
 number,


not
 from
 the
 actual
 person
 and
 and
 and


what
 they're
 saying.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 important
 because
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 people
 on
 Twitter
 that
 are
 young
 and


you
 know
 I'm
 seeing
 them
 fresh
 out
 of


college
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 seeing
 their


analysis
 on
 stuff.
 They
 don't
 have


$100,000
 to
 put
 into
 a
 Nebus
 but
 the


analysis
 they're
 putting
 out
 even
 if


they
 only
 have
 $10,000
 which
 is
 a
 lot


when
 you're
 20
 years
 old
 to
 put
 into


Nebas
 that
 stuff
 matters
 and
 to
 discount


it.
 I
 mean
 when
 I
 was
 starting
 out
 on


YouTube
 my
 first
 video
 was
 I
 put
 $25,000


into
 Palunteer
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was


pretty
 much
 my
 net
 worth
 at
 the
 time.
 I


mean
 like
 maybe
 I
 had
 like
 35
 maybe
 I


had
 10,000
 in
 some
 other
 bank
 account


but
 that
 was
 it.
 The
 analysis
 is
 what


really
 mattered.
 Not
 like
 I
 put
 250,000


because
 I
 didn't
 have
 250,000.
 I


couldn't
 have
 put
 that
 into
 right.


>> No,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 right
 way.


I
 mean
 maybe
 maybe
 you're
 in
 a
 situation


like
 Amit
 was,
 right?
 That
 you
 only
 you


have
 one
 shot
 and
 and
 that's
 the
 only


money
 you'll
 ever
 have.
 Your
 great
 aunt


Sue
 unfortunately
 passed
 away
 and
 then


maybe
 that's
 it.
 You
 you
 pile
 it
 all


into
 one
 thing.
 But
 to
 me,
 I
 think


there's
 more
 to
 be
 said
 about
 making


prudent
 investment
 decisions,
 running


your
 life
 like
 a
 business,
 trying
 to


understand
 that
 every
 paycheck
 you


should
 go
 reinvest
 it
 in
 yourself
 in


some
 sort
 of
 way,
 shape,
 or
 form.
 And
 I


think
 so
 many
 people
 think
 I
 could
 turn


this
 $1,000
 into
 a
 million.
 And
 it's


like
 that's
 a
 thousandx,
 man.
 Like


that's
 a
 lot.


>> You
 know,
 you
 know
 how
 you
 know
 how
 to


have
 the
 amount
 of
 difficulty.
 It's


literally
 add
 another
 thousand


portfolio.
 Now
 you
 only
 have
 to
 500x.


And
 if
 you
 do
 that
 every
 month,
 you


know,
 and
 I
 know
 $1,000
 is
 a
 lot.
 say


it's
 a hundred,
 right?
 You
 want
 to
 turn


a 100
 to
 a
 million,
 right?
 It's
 it's
 the


same
 sort
 of
 principle.
 It's
 about


principles
 in
 my
 opinion
 and
 how
 it


pertains
 to
 your
 goals,
 objectives,
 etc.


And
 not
 Bill
 next
 door,
 right?
 So,
 it


really
 just
 depends
 upon
 how
 you
 can


apply
 things
 to
 yourself
 and
 you
 know,


what
 does
 my
 net
 worth
 have
 anything
 to


do
 with
 you?


>> Nothing.


>> And
 and
 and
 what
 and
 what
 you're


listening
 to.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I


stopped
 sharing
 it
 back
 in
 2021
 2022.
 If


you're
 really
 curious
 about
 where
 I
 was


back
 then,
 go
 check
 out
 the
 channel.


But,
 you
 know,
 I
 haven't
 really


disclosed
 it.
 Um,
 I've
 disclosed
 it
 to


people
 personally,
 like,
 you
 know,
 but


not
 on
 X
 or
 anything
 like
 that.
 And,
 um,


I
 just
 don't
 think
 it's
 important,
 you


know.
 Um,
 yeah.
 Also,
 there's
 a
 level
 of


privacy
 that
 people
 want
 to
 keep,
 you


know,
 like
 it's
 it's
 okay
 to
 not
 tell


everyone
 how
 much
 money
 you
 have
 because


like
 you
 kind
 of
 don't
 want
 to
 tell
 the


world
 sometimes
 how
 much
 money
 you
 have.


>> That
 is
 okay
 to
 do.
 People
 thought
 I
 was


lying
 back
 then,
 so
 I
 mean,
 what's
 the


point
 of
 me
 saying
 it
 now?


>> Matt
 Money's
 YouTube
 is
 right
 there.
 By


the
 way,
 Matt,
 our
 our
 boy
 who's
 been


turning
 into
 the
 new
 Pelosi,
 he
 bought


some
 more
 Palunteer
 in
 October.


>> I
 saw
 that.
 That
 was
 so
 funny.


>> Our
 boy
 Cleo
 Fields,
 baby.
 Half
 a


million
 in
 Palanteer.
 Now
 he
 has
 to


disclose
 cuz
 he
 is
 an
 elected
 official


so
 he
 doesn't
 get
 to
 get
 away
 with
 it


even
 though
 they
 always
 disclose
 like
 45


days
 late.
 But


>> yeah,


>> I
 mean


>> I
 thought
 it
 was
 so
 funny.


>> Our
 boy
 Cleo,
 he
 continues
 to
 buy.


>> He
 knows
 I
 mean
 he
 probably
 sees
 the


amount
 of
 contracts
 that
 they're
 bidding


on
 and
 you
 know
 he
 knows
 the
 he
 knows


for
 a
 fact
 that
 NATO
 is
 going
 to
 be


running
 entirely
 off
 of
 Pal.
 We
 will


talk
 about
 it
 tonight
 but
 like
 so
 shout


out
 to
 the
 people
 that
 are
 going
 to


watch
 tonight.
 Uh
 but
 it's
 you
 think


about
 it,
 you
 start
 to
 see
 it
 and
 it's


my
 thought
 process
 back
 when
 I
 started


using
 the
 software
 2015
 2016
 is
 like


every
 company
 should
 be
 running
 off


this.
 Every
 process
 should
 be
 running


off
 this.
 The
 government
 should
 be


running
 off
 this
 and
 it's
 it's
 slowly


what's
 the
 word
 per
 not
 perforating


partic


>> permeating.
 Thank
 you.
 Um
 throughout
 the


entire
 economy
 and
 it's
 insane.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And


>> somebody
 asked,
 sorry,
 somebody
 asked
 if


I
 do
 401k.
 I
 do,
 uh,
 but
 I
 don't


contribute.
 I
 do
 the
 match,
 but
 I
 don't


do
 I
 don't
 max
 it
 out
 because
 I
 like
 to


have
 the
 ability
 to
 flexibly
 move
 my


money
 around
 and
 have
 access
 to
 it
 to


buy
 real
 estate
 or
 invest
 in
 other


things
 or
 um,
 so
 in
 my
 opinion,
 it
 like


I
 said,
 depends
 if
 you're
 going to
 be


working
 your
 job
 for
 the
 next
 30
 years.


If
 you're
 going
 to
 retire
 at
 say
 60
 and


you
 need
 that
 job,
 then
 do
 the
 match.


like
 max
 it
 out,
 right?
 Like
 get
 it
 that


as
 much
 of
 that
 tax
 advantage
 as
 you


can.
 But
 for
 me,
 I
 always
 wanted
 that


ability
 to
 to
 to
 switch
 careers
 if
 I
 if


I
 wanted
 to.
 And
 if
 you're
 not
 selling
 a


lot,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 pay
 a
 lot
 of


taxes
 anyway.
 Like
 for
 me,
 like
 I


haven't
 paid
 a
 single
 tax
 dollar
 on
 on


Palunteer
 other
 than
 the
 covered
 calls


that
 I've
 sold.
 So,
 and
 same
 thing
 with


Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 haven't
 paid
 a
 single


dollar
 on
 tax
 other
 than
 the
 covered


calls
 that
 I've
 sold.
 So,


>> I
 agree.
 And
 uh
 the
 flexibility
 of
 that


stuff
 is
 really
 important,
 especially
 if


you're
 managing
 a
 retirement
 account.
 We


were
 about
 to
 leave.
 I
 was
 about
 to
 end


it,
 but
 then
 this
 guy
 wants
 to
 join.


Steve,
 you're
 kind
 of
 late,
 buddy.


>> Look,
 daddy.


>> He's
 probably
 not
 even
 there.
 Look
 at


that.
 You're
 muted
 if
 you
 are
 there.


It's
 also
 not
 his
 fault
 because
 he
 had


Look,
 he
 text
 me
 two
 minutes.


Dude,
 this
 guy,
 he
 loves
 streaming
 so


much.
 He's
 just
 like
 getting
 into
 it.


>> He's
 married
 to
 the
 game.
 He's
 married


to
 the
 game
 and
 I
 love
 it.


>> He's
 married
 to
 the
 game.
 All right,


we'll
 get
 him
 on
 in
 a
 second.
 Uh,
 Matt,


did
 you
 see
 the
 Kramer
 clip
 on


Palunteer?


>> No,
 the
 one
 nobody
 was
 on
 stage
 or


>> Yeah.


>> No,
 I
 didn't
 end
 up
 getting
 to
 that.


>> Okay,
 so
 for
 those
 that
 didn't
 see
 it,


here's
 uh
 here's
 the
 clip
 because
 this


was
 pretty
 incredible
 as
 well
 to
 see.
 By


the
 way,
 Elon
 just
 did
 Olin.
 So,
 he
 did


Rogan
 and
 Olen.
 So,
 for
 those
 who
 are


Elon
 fans,
 you've
 got
 like
 five
 hours
 of


Elon
 content
 over
 the
 weekend


to
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to


consume.
 Okay,
 this
 is


this
 is
 what
 Mr.
 Kramer
 had
 to
 say
 about


Palunteer.


>> Palanteer,
 are
 you
 as
 impressed
 with


Alex
 Karp
 as
 he
 is
 with
 himself?


>> All
 right.
 So,


>> I
 find
 him
 to
 be
 really
 interesting.
 I'm


not
 long
 the
 stock.
 I'm
 curious
 books


who
 come
 out.
 Axio
 says
 some
 stuff
 about


it.
 Uh
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 him.
 Uh


>> isn't
 he
 a
 Philly?
 He's
 a
 Philly
 guy,


too.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 I
 I
 told
 him
 that.
 I
 said,


"Listen,
 like
 you're
 like
 a
 more


repulsive
 Philly
 guy
 than
 I
 am."
 I
 gave


him
 a
 note
 once.
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 not
 your


enemy."
 And
 he
 goes,
 "Yeah."
 I
 said,


"No,
 that's
 a
 peace
 offering."
 Yeah.
 It


was
 like
 horrible.
 He's
 like
 a
 horrible


guy,
 but
 I
 think
 he's
 real.
 I
 think
 that


and
 I
 say
 that
 because
 like
 like
 all
 the


companies
 that
 have
 hired
 him,
 the
 big


ones,
 I've
 called
 them
 and
 I
 said,
 "How


is
 it?"
 And
 they
 all
 to
 a
 person
 say,


"Listen,
 it's
 pretty
 good."


>> I
 mean,
 he's
 on
 fire.
 That
 business
 is


on
 fire.


>> It's
 on
 fire,


>> but
 is
 it
 too
 expensive
 even
 given
 how


on
 fire
 they
 are?


>> Um,


>> it
 seems
 crazy
 to
 me.


>> It
 is
 rule
 of
 80.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 I'm
 going


to
 end
 up
 It's
 gonna
 go


>> They're
 killing
 rule
 of
 80.


>> They're
 they're
 they're
 killing
 it.
 And


the
 you
 know
 look
 Boeing
 just
 went
 with


them
 and
 Ortberg
 was
 a
 very
 serious
 guy.


When
 I
 say
 the
 serious
 guys
 it's
 like


the
 uh
 scene
 in
 in
 Succession
 when
 right


yeah
 right
 Brian
 you
 you
 are
 not
 serious


people.
 Well
 it's
 like
 a
 great
 line


because
 I'm
 talking
 about
 people
 who
 are


serious
 like
 Orber
 would
 not
 be
 going
 to


him.
 I
 know
 a
 kid
 who
 who
 went
 there


from
 uh
 from
 Wharton
 and
 I
 know
 his
 mom


and
 his
 mom
 was
 saying
 you
 know
 they


work
 247.
 Uh
 they're
 all
 Karp
 to
 them
 is


a
 hero
 because
 he's
 really
 not
 imperious


at
 all
 to
 them
 and
 that's
 what
 makes
 me


like
 him.
 Now
 I
 sent
 that
 guy
 Shyam
 the


number
 two
 guy.
 He
 had
 a
 really
 good


piece
 about
 the
 military
 last
 week.
 I


sent
 him
 an
 email
 and
 I
 and
 I
 knew
 he


wasn't
 going
 to
 return
 but
 I
 said
 look


that
 you
 know
 I
 know
 you
 guys
 despise
 me


whatever.
 But
 then
 I
 meet
 this
 woman


Wendy
 who's
 in
 charge
 of
 defense.
 She's


>> So
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to
 keep
 watching
 that


you
 can
 keep
 you
 can
 uh
 hear
 it.
 I'll


put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 in
 the
 channel.
 But


I
 mean,
 look,
 Karp
 uh
 Kramer
 said
 that


Karp
 was
 not
 a
 real
 businessman
 and
 that


Paliner
 was
 not
 a
 real
 business.
 And
 so


obviously,


you
 know,
 that's
 why
 Karp
 is
 not
 the


biggest
 fan
 of
 it.


>> Dude,
 those
 guys
 run
 on
 something


different.
 They
 run
 on
 like
 I
 I
 I've


seen
 people
 work,
 but
 that's
 been
 the


reason
 why
 I
 bought
 them
 on
 direct


listing
 day.
 Like
 they
 are
 on
 something


else.
 Like
 I
 don't know
 if
 they
 say,


"Hey,
 you
 realize
 when
 we
 give
 you
 this


offer,
 like
 you
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 a


completely
 different
 kind
 of
 human
 being


than
 everybody
 else
 on
 the
 goddamn


planet."
 They
 they
 have
 to
 like
 you've


met
 so
 many
 of
 their
 employees.
 They're


just
 they're
 all
 so
 unique
 and
 so


different
 in
 a
 good
 way,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> In
 a
 good
 way.
 All
 right,
 Steve.
 I
 think


he's
 here.


I
 just
 saw
 him
 and
 then
 he
 disappeared.


Milkman,


>> I'm
 here.


>> Did
 you
 go
 and
 get
 your
 milk?


>> No.
 There
 he
 is.
 You


>> get
 them
 fresh
 milk
 for
 like,
 is
 that


what
 you're


>> No,
 I'm
 freaking
 starving.
 Sorry
 to
 do


this
 to
 you
 guys,
 but
 I
 I
 haven't
 even


had
 lunch
 yet.
 Like,


>> dude,
 why
 are
 you
 complaining?
 You're


You're
 a
 full-time
 streamer
 now.
 This
 is


I
 don't
 eat
 for
 seven
 hours.
 That's
 how


it
 is.
 Like,


>> I
 ordered
 diner
 in
 the
 car
 on
 the
 way


home


>> and
 you
 just
 muted
 yourself.
 Are
 you


with
 Steve?
 Are
 you
 an
 amateur
 today?


What's
 going
 on?


>> No,
 I
 just
 got
 home.
 I
 ordered
 diner


from
 the
 car.
 He
 met
 me
 at
 the
 door.
 It


was
 freaking
 perfect
 timing.
 Got
 a
 nice


burger.
 Medium.


>> That
 red
 meat,
 baby.


>> That
 red
 meat.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 look,
 I'll
 ask
 you
 one


question,
 then
 we'll
 end
 it
 out
 for
 for


the
 day
 and
 you
 can
 get
 to
 eat
 your


food.
 But
 just
 like
 and
 we
 kind
 of
 talk


about


>> No,
 it's
 fine.


>> No,
 no,
 we
 gotta
 end
 it.
 We
 gotta
 let


Matt
 go.
 I
 gotta
 go
 as
 well.
 But
 I
 mean,


overall
 thoughts
 on
 uh
 this
 week,
 sixth


month
 in
 a
 row
 green
 for
 the
 S&P
 500.


>> I
 mean,


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any
 way
 we're
 not


getting
 to
 7,000
 at
 this
 point.


>> I
 agree.


>> Unless
 something
 happens
 with
 China.
 I


mean,
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 big
 retracement
 or


anything.
 And


Nvidia
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 have
 great


numbers.
 I
 I
 didn't
 really
 see
 anything


that
 happened
 today
 other
 than
 Chevron


Exon.
 Chevron
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 quarter


and
 the
 H
 deal
 seems
 like
 it's
 going
 to


be
 amazing.
 So,


I'm
 really
 happy
 with
 where
 things
 are


right
 now.
 I
 think
 Meta,
 look,
 if
 you


looked
 at
 my
 article,
 it's
 more
 of
 what


I
 said
 last
 night.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 huge


opportunity
 right
 now.
 I
 think
 Amazon's


a
 huge


>> 648
 today.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 crazy.
 These
 people
 are


crazy.


It's
 crazy.


>> I
 want
 to
 see
 that
 chart
 to
 the
 right.
 I


want
 to
 see
 that
 chart
 to
 the
 right.
 How


many
 times
 has
 this
 guy
 covered
 this?


>> What
 chart?


>> The
 chart
 to
 the
 right
 that
 shows
 like


how
 many
 buy
 recommendations


>> all
 the
 way.


>> We
 did
 this
 last
 night.
 Go
 on
 my
 profile


and
 look,
 Matt.
 I've
 done
 like
 30


articles
 on
 Meta.
 All
 buys.


>> Champion.


>> Champion.
 Yeah.


>> All
 buys
 for
 like
 five
 years.


since
 2018.


>> Yeah.


>> When
 did
 you
 start
 writing?


>> 2018.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


>> I
 think
 that
 we're
 in
 an
 opportunity


cycle
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 keep


going
 up.


I
 don't
 see
 any
 headwinds
 at
 the
 moment.


I
 hate
 saying
 that,
 but
 maybe
 a


recession
 is
 in
 the
 bingo
 card
 to
 the


back
 half
 of
 26.
 If
 unemployment
 keeps


going
 like
 this,
 who
 knows?
 But


right
 now,
 corporate
 earnings
 are
 really


strong
 and
 the
 companies
 that
 are
 not


producing
 revenue
 are
 not
 going
 to


impact
 the
 S&P
 or
 the
 NASDAQ.
 So,
 I'm


just
 I'm
 not
 worried
 about
 it.


>> The
 thing
 I'm
 the
 thing
 that
 still


concerns
 me,
 Steve,
 is
 exactly
 what
 I


was
 telling
 you
 the
 other
 day
 is
 is
 that


that
 remaining
 free
 cash
 flow
 after


after
 dividends
 and
 and
 share
 buybacks,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 rear
 its


head
 at
 all
 this
 year.
 I
 think


everyone's
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 power


through
 it.
 But
 the
 second
 half
 of
 next


year,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 start
 to
 to


come
 to
 fruition.
 I
 think
 you
 already


started
 to
 see
 people
 on
 CNBC
 talk
 about


it.
 Um,
 so
 if
 I'm
 talking
 about
 it
 and


then
 they
 start
 talking
 about
 it,
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 eventually
 going
 to
 perforate


through
 permeate
 as
 a
 kindly
 corrected


me.
 The


>> Sorry,
 go
 ahead.


>> I
 just
 don't
 know
 that
 we
 can
 go
 against


the
 most
 brilliant
 minds
 in
 the
 country.


>> I'm
 with
 you.


>> That's


Oh
 no.
 buyback
 slow
 down
 for
 a
 little


bit.
 who
 freaking
 like
 in
 the
 grand


scheme
 of
 things
 if
 this
 was
 shortterm


money
 I
 would
 be
 like
 you
 know
 what


maybe
 this
 isn't
 such
 a
 great
 idea
 but


over
 the
 next
 f
 they're
 they're
 building


this
 out
 for
 the
 next
 5
 10
 15
 years
 and


when
 you
 think
 about
 how
 they're


deploying
 capex
 if
 they
 fall
 behind
 and


they're
 wrong


you're
 their
 profitability
 is
 off
 the


table
 in
 the
 future
 so
 I
 would
 rather


them
 spend
 the
 capex
 and
 cut
 the


buybacks
 by
 20%
 or
 so
 because
 this
 is


the
 next
 leg
 of
 future
 profitability
 and


I
 would
 be
 willing
 to
 take
 that
 as
 a


shareholder.
 So


I'm
 just
 not
 willing
 to
 go
 against
 big


tech
 right
 now.


That's
 to
 be
 fair
 that
 that's
 one
 of the


problems
 that
 I
 have
 with
 some
 oil


companies
 is
 they
 focused
 too
 much
 on


buybacks
 and
 dividends
 and
 in
 reality
 if


they
 just
 focused
 on
 acquiring
 more
 and


investing
 through
 the
 cycle
 then
 their


buybacks
 and
 dividends
 would
 eventually


catch
 up
 in
 a
 couple
 years.
 So
 to
 me
 I'm


I'm
 hoping
 that
 they
 manage
 it
 well.
 I


was
 telling
 a
 bit
 earlier
 that
 somebody


will
 fail
 a
 couple
 like
 somebody
 will


not
 do
 well.
 They'll
 be
 too
 focused
 like


oh
 we
 can't
 do
 the
 buy
 we
 can't
 cut
 on


buybacks
 or
 anything
 like
 that.
 I
 would


actually
 welcome
 it.
 In
 fact,
 I
 welcomed


it
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 companies
 cut
 their


dividends
 back
 in
 2020.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


this
 is
 a
 good
 resetting
 point
 because


at
 the
 time,
 Shell
 was
 paying
 15
 a
 year


and
 however
 many
 other
 companies
 were


paying
 20
 billion
 a
 year
 in
 dividends.


So,
 I
 was
 like,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 reset.


But,
 yeah,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 curious
 to
 see


how
 they
 navigate
 it.
 You're
 right.


Maybe
 it's
 only
 a
 5
 10%
 impact
 if
 they


cut
 share
 buybacks
 versus
 where
 they'll


end
 up
 being,
 which
 is
 20
 30%
 40%
 higher


because
 of
 the
 net
 income
 growth.


ground.

 Alphabet

billion
 in
 shares.
 Oh
 no,
 we're
 only


going
 to
 buy
 back
 55
 billion
 now.
 Like,


is
 it
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal?
 That's
 more


cash
 than
 companies
 generate
 in
 a
 5
 to


10
 year
 cycle.
 Like,


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 something


I'm
 going
 to
 really
 get
 up
 in
 arms
 about


when
 we
 see
 the
 backlog
 numbers
 on
 cloud


and
 AI
 is
 still
 in
 its
 infancy.
 So
 to


me,
 that
 cash
 is
 better
 used
 being


deployed
 into
 what's
 going
 to
 be
 the


growth
 engine
 of
 the
 company
 going


forward
 and
 what's
 going
 to
 propel
 the


S&P
 higher.


>> I
 agree.


>> I
 would
 agree.
 Matt
 Money's
 YouTube,
 I'm


putting
 that
 in
 the
 chat.
 Steve,
 are
 you


going
 to
 stream
 anytime
 soon?


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 actually
 probably
 gonna
 do
 a


do
 something
 at
 6:30
 for
 a
 while.


Get
 caught
 up
 on
 a
 few
 things.
 probably


going
 to
 do
 something
 and
 then
 uh


probably
 going
 to
 do
 something
 tonight


too
 around
 9
 9:30.
 But
 um
 admit
 I
 wanted


to
 ask
 you
 something.
 How
 you
 feeling


for
 Monday?


>> Well,
 real
 quick,
 Steve's
 YouTube
 is


right
 there.
 So
 for
 those
 that
 want
 to


subscribe
 to
 him,
 he'll
 be
 streaming
 in


like
 an
 hour,
 so
 you
 can
 check
 him
 out


on
 his
 stream.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 the
 rest
 of


us
 will
 be
 back
 on
 Pounder
 Weekly
 at
 11.


No,
 I'm
 feeling
 good
 for
 Monday.
 I


didn't
 expect
 the
 stock
 to
 move
 before


the
 earnings,
 although
 that
 happens.


It's
 happened
 a
 couple
 times.
 So
 yeah,


Matt,
 me
 and
 Amir
 will
 get
 deeper
 into


it
 tonight
 on
 the
 weekly,
 but
 I
 agree


with
 Matt.
 Margins
 are
 what
 I
 care
 about


more.
 Topline
 revenue
 growth,
 I
 think


it'll
 break
 50%.
 I
 think
 guidance
 for
 26


right
 now
 is
 at
 45.
 That
 might
 bump
 up


to
 like
 4850,
 but
 the
 stocks
 already


made
 a
 move.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 have


no
 idea
 how
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 react,


but
 the
 numbers
 I
 think
 are
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 damn
 good.


>> What's
 Monday,
 Steve?


[Laughter]


Super
 Bowl,
 dude.
 Super
 Bowl.


>> Super
 Bowl
 hat,
 baby.


>> What
 is
 it?


>> It's


>> You're
 wearing
 the
 hat.


>> Thought
 it
 was
 Tuesday.
 Isn't
 it
 on


Tuesdays?


>> No,
 it's
 on
 Monday.
 Am
 I
 Am
 I
 wrong?
 No,


it's
 on
 Monday.


>> I
 thought
 it
 was
 on
 Monday.
 I
 could
 be


wrong.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 Monday.


>> It's
 definitely
 November
 3rd.
 Yeah,


dude.
 It's
 Monday.


>> Okay,
 good.
 Yeah,
 I
 ain't


>> doing
 nothing
 Monday
 night.


There
 you
 go.
 That'll
 be
 Monday


>> at
 3:30.


>> Yeah.
 Live.


>> I
 am
 hoping
 that
 they
 have
 a
 five
 in


front
 of
 the
 number
 for
 revenue
 growth.


I
 don't
 know
 how
 they
 go.


>> That's
 going
 to
 happen.
 It
 is
 because


they
 they
 guided
 for
 50%.
 So
 there's
 no


way
 they
 don't.


>> I'm
 just
 saying
 I
 I
 hope
 that
 they
 have


a
 five.
 If
 they
 if
 they
 come
 out
 with
 a


six


>> Oh,
 that
 then
 we
 are
 gonna
 have
 some


fun,
 bro.
 Like
 all
 I'm
 saying
 is
 if
 they


come
 out
 with
 a
 six,
 all
 hell
 is


breaking
 loose.


>> If
 they
 show
 60%
 revenue,


not
 even
 inviding
 loose.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 no
 other
 software
 name


close.
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 growing
 60%


anymore.


And
 if
 they
 guide
 upwards
 of
 60%.
 I


mean,
 dude,


>> the
 rule
 of


>> Yeah.


I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 the
 rule
 of
 80
 instead
 of
 the
 rule


of
 40,
 but
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 quite


incredible.
 They
 already
 have
 rule
 of


81.
 So,


>> I
 should
 be
 able
 to
 Yeah,
 I
 should
 be


able
 to
 stream
 that.
 Uh
 cuz
 it'll
 be


what?
 I
 don't
 remember.
 Was
 it
 five


hours
 ahead,
 so
 that'll
 be


>> Oh,
 you're
 the
 UK
 on
 Monday.


>> Yeah,
 Monday
 I'll
 be


>> So,
 you're
 flying
 out
 tomorrow?


>> Flying
 out
 tomorrow
 night.
 Yeah.


>> Matt's
 gonna
 have
 some
 tea
 and
 crumpets.


Oh,
 some
 biscuits.


>> I
 mean,
 listen,
 English
 breakfast
 tea
 is


the
 only
 good
 tea.
 So,


>> I
 had
 some
 yesterday.


>> Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.


Steve's
 YouTube
 in
 the
 chat.
 He's
 going


to
 stream
 in
 about
 an
 hour.
 Matt,


>> I'll
 be
 on
 around
 600,
 guys.


>> I
 might
 have
 to
 go
 get
 some
 cookies
 to


watch
 that.
 Steve,


>> I
 mean,
 why
 don't
 you
 just
 come
 on?


>> Maybe
 I
 will.
 Maybe
 I'll
 have
 to
 go
 get


some
 cookies
 to
 come
 on.


You
 both
 of
 you
 have
 an
 open
 invite.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 sure
 Mid
 has.
 What's
 your


favorite
 cookie?


>> Chocolate
 chip.
 It's
 always
 chocolate


chip.


>> Although
 Oreo
 is
 up
 there,
 but
 it's


chocolate
 chip.


>> I
 do
 have
 to
 get
 candy
 for
 the
 little


ones
 coming
 tonight,
 so


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Well,
 I'm
 in
 an
 apartment


complex,
 so
 it's
 not
 really


>> Yeah,
 Houston's
 a
 little
 weird.
 They


normally
 go
 to
 the
 rich
 neighborhoods,


and
 I'm
 not
 in
 there.
 So,


>> that
 makes
 sense.
 That
 makes
 sense.
 All


right.
 Thank
 you,
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 Congrats
