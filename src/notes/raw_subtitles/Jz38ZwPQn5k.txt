If
 you
 take

 Update

I'm
 Christine
 Sierette.
 I'm
 Kyra


Blackwell.
 I'm
 Rosie
 Garin.
 And
 you're


listening
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


[Music]


Hey
 pals.
 Hi.
 Hey.
 We're
 going
 tech


today.


>> I
 think
 that
 you
 both
 know
 and
 that


hopefully
 our
 listeners
 know
 that
 I'm


like
 a
 super
 super
 tech
 wiz.
 I
 know
 all


the
 things.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 looking


forward
 to


>> You're
 going
 to
 school
 our
 guest.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 school
 our
 guest
 today.


>> Nothing
 could
 be
 farther
 from
 the
 truth.


>> Yeah.
 your
 nose
 is
 growing
 and
 growing


and
 growing
 and
 growing
 Pinocchio
 style.


Um,


>> yeah,
 we
 are
 always
 sort
 of
 thinking


about
 what
 kind
 of
 tech
 episodes
 we
 can


do.
 And
 the
 truth
 is
 that
 not
 one
 of
 us


is
 particularly
 techsavvy.


>> And
 it's
 ironic
 because
 Wire
 Cutter
 is


actually
 known
 as
 a
 tech
 site


foundationally.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 where
 it


started.
 So,
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 ironic
 that


the
 three
 of
 us
 feel
 so
 out
 of
 our
 depth


when
 we're
 talking
 about
 computers.


Well,
 all
 these
 years
 later,
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 really,
 really
 clever
 and


talented
 techy
 people
 at
 Wire
 Cutter
 who


now
 help
 us.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 Kimber


streams.
 Kimber
 wrote
 a
 piece
 on
 the


site
 called
 How
 to
 Make
 Your
 Old


Computer
 Feel
 New
 Again.
 And
 I
 think


each
 of
 us
 individually
 has
 bookmarked


>> that.
 Yeah,
 it's
 been
 on
 my
 list
 of
 to


do
 all
 the
 things
 in
 this
 article.


So
 Kimber's
 guest
 today
 and
 we're
 going


to
 get
 into
 that.
 How
 to
 make
 your


laptop,
 your
 Mac,
 your
 PC
 feel,
 what
 you


can
 actually
 do
 and
 how
 to
 sort
 of


empower
 yourself
 to
 do
 that.


>> And
 the
 first
 step
 isn't
 surprise,
 panic


and
 take
 it
 immediately
 to
 your
 local


Apple
 Genius
 Bar
 or
 whatever
 your


>> or
 buy
 a
 new
 one.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 But


I
 think
 Kimber
 will
 be
 able
 to
 help


guide
 us
 in
 when
 there
 is
 a
 limit
 to


what
 you
 can
 actually
 do
 to
 make
 your


computer
 feel
 faster
 and
 more
 efficient


and
 when
 it
 is
 actually
 time
 to
 buy


something
 new.


>> Well,
 I'm
 really
 excited.
 You
 guys
 know


that
 saying
 when
 uh
 when
 you
 don't
 know


how
 anything
 works,
 everything
 is
 a


conspiracy.
 Like
 every
 single
 time
 my


laptop
 like
 twitches,
 I'm
 like
 Steve


Jobs
 has
 something
 to
 do
 with
 this.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 Kimber
 might
 have
 a


different
 perspective.
 So,
 let's
 hear


from
 them
 right
 after
 the
 break.
 Stick


around.


[Music]


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 Today
 we're
 talking
 with


Kimber
 streams,
 Wire
 Cutter
 senior
 staff


writer
 covering
 laptops.
 Kimber
 has


tested
 hundreds
 of
 laptops,
 including


ultrabooks,
 gaming
 laptops,
 Chromebooks,


and
 budget
 Windows
 laptops,
 plus
 a
 ton


of
 keyboards,
 mice,
 and
 other


accessories.
 They're
 a
 laptop
 wizard,


and
 I
 cannot
 wait
 to
 hear
 your
 best


advice,
 Kimber.
 Hey,
 Kimber.
 It's
 great


to
 see
 you.
 Great
 to
 be
 here.
 We've


established
 you
 test
 laptops,


specifically
 PC
 laptops,
 plus


accessories
 like
 keyboards
 and
 mice.
 I'm


always
 curious
 how
 different
 folks
 at


Wire
 Cutter
 got
 into
 their
 line
 of
 work.


So,
 how
 how
 did
 you
 get
 into
 this?


>> Yeah,
 so
 I've
 always
 been
 the
 person


that
 people
 in
 my
 life
 come
 to
 for


laptop
 advice,
 but
 if
 you're
 looking
 for


my
 villain
 origin
 story,
 it
 was


>> What
 kind
 of
 spider
 bit
 you?
 Yeah,
 a a


radioactive
 laptop
 bit
 me.
 Back
 when
 I


was
 a
 broke
 college
 student,
 my
 laptop


died
 and
 I
 needed
 a
 new
 one
 and
 I
 had
 no


money.
 So,
 I
 saved
 up
 and
 I
 saved
 up
 and


I
 finally
 bought
 a
 new
 one
 and
 it
 was


awful.
 It
 was
 complete
 garbage.
 It
 just


gave
 me
 grief
 forever.
 So,
 now
 I
 make
 it


my
 job
 to
 save
 other
 people
 from
 the


same
 fate.


>> That's
 amazing.


>> What
 actually
 made
 you
 interested
 and


intrigued?
 cuz
 I
 think
 if
 my
 laptop


broke,
 I
 would
 call
 for
 someone
 to
 fix


it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 didn't
 have
 anyone
 like
 that
 to


lean
 on.
 I
 was
 like
 kind
 of
 the
 most


tech
 person
 around.
 So,
 I
 went
 on
 the


internet
 and
 I
 learned
 about
 all
 the


different
 laptop
 specs
 and
 what
 to
 look


for
 in
 a
 laptop
 and
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 reading


and
 then
 I
 got
 into
 tech
 journalism
 and


here
 I
 am.
 The
 rest
 is
 history.


>> And
 autodidact,
 how
 do
 you
 test
 laptops


for
 Wire
 Cutter?
 What
 is
 this
 process


like
 for
 you?
 We
 test
 laptops
 at
 Wire


Cutter
 by
 using
 them
 just
 like
 everyone


does.
 So,
 we
 browse
 the
 web.
 We
 I
 do


work
 on
 them.
 I
 binge
 watch
 shows
 on


them.
 We
 also
 have
 our
 own
 battery
 test


that
 we
 designed
 that
 simulates
 real


world
 web
 browsing
 use
 that
 gives


readers
 kind
 of
 an
 idea
 of
 how
 long
 a


laptop's
 going
 to
 actually
 last
 versus


some
 of
 the
 more
 synthetic
 benchmarks


that
 there
 are
 out
 there
 that
 don't
 do


that.


>> What
 is
 this
 battery
 test
 you
 created?


So,
 it's
 a
 Chrome
 extension
 and
 it


cycles
 through
 a
 series
 of
 popular


websites
 and
 it
 opens
 a
 Google
 doc
 and


it
 messes
 in
 the
 Google
 doc.
 It
 opens
 up


a
 YouTube
 video.
 It
 has
 audio
 streaming


in
 the
 background.
 It
 checks
 email.
 It


kind
 of
 does
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you


would
 usually
 do
 on
 a
 laptop.


>> How
 many
 laptops
 are
 you
 testing
 a
 year?


>> Yeah,
 so
 last
 year
 I
 tested
 around
 90


laptops.
 Um,
 so
 far
 this
 year
 I've


tested
 more
 than
 80,
 but
 I
 also
 just
 got


some
 more
 delivered
 like
 yesterday.
 So,


I'm
 sure
 that's
 number
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up


before
 the
 year
 is
 out.


>> Kimber,
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 with
 all


these
 laptops
 once
 you're
 done
 with


them?
 Where
 are
 they
 going?


>> So,
 they
 go
 back
 to
 the
 companies
 that


lend
 them
 to
 me
 for
 testing.
 The
 ones


that
 we've
 bought,
 we
 either
 hold
 on
 to


for
 long-term
 testing
 to
 make
 sure
 like


in
 a
 year,
 how
 does
 it
 feel
 to
 use?
 Did


the
 screen
 break?
 How's
 it
 going?
 And


then
 the
 ones
 that
 we
 own
 that
 we
 don't


use
 anymore
 go
 to
 a
 recycling
 service


called
 Revive.


>> Okay.


>> Do
 you
 are
 you
 are
 you
 stress
 testing


them
 at
 all?
 because
 I
 I
 was
 typing
 last


night
 and
 uh
 I
 accidentally
 spilled
 some


salt
 on
 my
 keyboard.
 Um
 and
 so
 I'm
 just


I'm
 just
 suggesting
 that
 there
 are
 real


people
 who
 make


>> mistakes


>> mistakes.


I
 do
 some
 basic
 stress
 testing
 like
 I'll


flex
 the
 hinge
 a
 bunch
 and
 like
 I'll


I'll
 grab
 the
 screen
 and
 see
 like
 how


flexible
 it
 is.
 I'll
 push
 on
 the
 lid
 and


see
 like
 if
 it's
 creaky
 or
 bendy
 or
 if


it
 cracks.
 I
 did
 crack
 like
 the


underside
 of
 a
 laptop
 once
 doing
 that.


And
 like
 I'll
 push
 on
 the
 keyboard,
 but


we
 don't
 do
 spill
 testing
 on
 laptops


because
 generally
 they're
 aside
 from
 one


laptop
 that
 I've
 tested
 that
 actually


had
 holes
 underneath
 the
 keyboard
 to


vent
 liquid
 out.
 It
 was
 designed
 for


kids
 specifically.


>> I
 feel
 attacked.


>> I
 clearly
 need
 a
 laptop
 with
 holes
 in


the
 bottom.


>> Yeah,
 generally
 we
 don't
 spill
 liquids


on
 them
 on
 purpose.


Kimber,
 these
 days,
 how
 long
 should
 you


expect
 a
 laptop
 to
 last?


>> So,
 a
 great
 laptop
 is
 going
 to
 last
 at


least
 5
 years
 or
 longer
 if
 you're
 lucky


and
 don't
 spill
 liquids
 on
 your


keyboard.


>> Okay.
 Okay.


Okay.


>> It
 um
 it
 doesn't
 actually
 differ
 too


much
 based
 on
 the
 brand,
 but
 rather
 like


the
 price
 bracket
 that
 you're
 working


in.
 So,
 cheaper
 laptops
 that
 are
 under


$500
 aren't
 going
 to
 last
 as
 long
 as
 5


years.
 They're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 feel


slow
 probably
 in
 just
 a
 few
 years


because
 they
 start
 with
 slower


processors,
 less
 memory,
 slower
 storage,


just
 lower
 stuff
 overall.


>> To
 that
 point,
 Kimber,
 what
 are
 some


signs
 that
 your
 current
 laptop
 might


need
 some
 love
 or
 might
 need
 to
 be


replaced?


>> So,
 if
 your
 laptop
 is
 super
 slow
 to
 boot


up,
 it
 takes
 kind
 of
 a
 long
 time
 to


launch
 some
 apps,
 or
 just
 generally


feels
 sluggish
 to
 use,
 it
 might
 need


some
 TLC.
 Your
 article
 about
 fixing


laptops
 um
 sort
 of
 blew
 my
 mind,
 Kimber,


mostly
 because
 it's
 never
 really


occurred
 to
 me,
 like
 I
 said,
 to
 fix
 my


own
 laptop.
 I've
 always
 assumed
 that
 if


there's
 something
 wrong,
 I
 should
 bring


it
 somewhere
 and
 have
 someone
 who
 knows


how
 to
 do
 it
 fix
 it.
 Kind
 of
 like
 I


think
 about
 my
 car.
 You
 suggest
 in
 your


piece
 that
 we
 should
 actually
 think


differently
 about
 troubleshooting
 our


laptops.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 that
 a


little
 bit?
 We
 kind
 of
 live
 inside
 of


our
 computers
 nowadays
 and
 like
 the
 the


space
 that
 you
 live
 in
 gets
 messy
 and


cluttered.
 So
 you
 might
 feel
 like
 your


computer
 is
 a
 car
 because
 it's
 a


complicated
 piece
 of
 technology,
 but


it's
 really
 more
 like
 your
 home.
 It's


like
 your
 living
 space.
 So
 cleaning
 up


your
 files
 and
 tidying
 up
 unused
 apps


isn't
 like
 electrical
 or
 plumbing
 work.


It's
 not
 something
 that
 you
 need
 an


expert
 for.
 It's
 more
 like
 vacuuming
 or


picking
 up
 some
 dirty
 socks
 that
 are
 on


the
 floor.
 If
 you
 can
 do
 those
 things,


you
 can
 clean
 your
 computer,
 too.


>> Again,
 I
 feel
 attacked.
 Um,
 so


essentially,
 you're
 suggesting
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 issues
 people
 have
 with


laptops
 are
 coming
 from
 maybe
 the
 fact


that
 they're
 not
 caring
 for
 them
 in
 the


way
 that
 they
 could
 be.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 people
 feel


intimidated
 by
 technology
 and
 that


neglect
 builds
 up
 over
 time,
 but
 if
 you


take
 like
 15
 minutes
 here
 or
 there
 just


to
 do
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 routine


tidying,
 it's
 going
 to
 add
 up
 over
 time,


just
 like
 the
 opposite
 adds
 up
 over


time.
 I
 love
 this
 analogy
 of
 a
 computer


being
 kind
 of
 like
 your
 home
 because
 I


also,
 like
 Rosie,
 always
 have
 thought
 of


my
 computer
 as
 this
 like
 chore
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 to
 someone
 else
 to
 fix.


But
 if
 you're
 thinking
 about
 cleaning
 up


your
 computer
 as
 you
 would
 your
 home,
 do


you
 have
 a
 strategy
 for
 how
 you
 time


that?
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 I'll
 out


myself
 too
 here.
 I
 do
 it
 whenever
 my


desktop
 is
 like
 completely
 a
 mess


because
 that's
 kind
 of
 where
 I
 save
 all


of
 my
 files
 to
 and
 that's
 my
 biggest


indicator
 of
 like
 this
 is
 a
 huge


cluttery
 mess.
 Or
 like
 everyone
 else,


whenever
 something's
 broken
 and
 doesn't


work,
 then
 I
 need
 to
 sit
 down
 and
 do


something
 about
 it.
 If
 I
 were
 a
 perfect


person
 living
 in
 a
 perfect
 world,
 I


would
 say
 probably
 every
 3
 months
 you


could
 sit
 down
 on
 like
 a
 Saturday


morning
 with
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 and
 take
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 to
 tidy
 up
 your


computer.
 So,
 let's
 just
 assume
 that
 I


have
 the
 confidence
 to
 try
 to
 fix
 my
 own


laptop.
 How
 hard
 is
 this
 actually
 going


to
 be?
 And
 will
 I
 mess
 up
 my
 computer
 in


the
 process
 of
 doing
 it?


>> You
 could
 totally
 do
 it.
 Fixing
 your


computer
 is
 not
 as
 scary
 as
 you
 think
 it


is.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 things
 are
 things


that
 you
 could
 do
 in
 about
 15
 minutes,


maybe
 30
 if
 you
 have
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 files


to
 go
 through.
 And
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be


a
 tech
 wizard
 to
 do
 any
 of
 this.


>> I
 imagine
 you
 are
 probably
 the
 person


who
 all
 your
 friends
 come
 to
 with


questions
 about
 their
 laptops.
 Is
 that


right?


>> Yes,
 that
 is
 absolutely
 correct.


>> Is
 broken.
 Can
 you
 help
 me?


>> Yeah.
 Family,
 too.


>> And
 I
 would
 imagine
 a
 lot
 of
 these


problems
 are
 maybe
 individual
 problems.


Everybody
 has
 their
 own
 issues,
 but
 are


there
 themes
 that
 you
 find
 are
 the


common
 things
 that
 seem
 to
 be


problematic
 with
 computers?
 Why
 they're


slow,
 why
 they're
 slow
 to
 boot
 up,
 why


they're
 not
 doing
 the
 things
 you
 want


them
 to
 do
 as
 fast
 as
 they
 as
 they
 used


to.
 I
 guess
 like
 advice,
 the
 first


biggest
 impact
 things
 that
 you
 would


tell
 somebody
 in
 general
 to
 do
 if


they're
 feeling
 like
 their
 computer


isn't
 operating
 as
 well
 as
 it
 used
 to.


The
 first
 one
 would
 be
 to
 tidy
 up
 your


files
 and
 make
 sure
 your
 storage
 isn't


too
 full.
 After
 that,
 you
 should
 get
 rid


of
 any
 apps
 or
 browser
 extensions
 that


you're
 not
 using
 anymore.
 And
 you
 should


also
 make
 sure
 that
 everything
 is


updated,
 your
 operating
 system,
 and
 your


apps.
 And
 those
 three
 steps
 will
 fix


probably
 90%
 of
 computer
 problems,
 if


not
 more.
 These
 steps
 seem
 simple


enough,
 the
 the
 three
 steps
 you
 just


listed,
 but
 let's
 dig
 into
 each
 of
 those


a
 little
 more.
 Starting
 with
 cleaning
 up


your
 storage.
 Why
 do
 you
 need
 to
 do


this?
 And
 how
 do
 you
 even
 start?
 When


your
 storage
 is
 close
 to
 full,
 your


computer
 can
 actually
 slow
 down.
 It's


also
 just
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 tidy
 things
 up


to
 make
 stuff
 easier
 to
 find
 and
 get
 rid


of
 stuff
 you
 don't
 need
 anymore
 because


otherwise
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at


just
 like
 multiple
 filing
 cabinets
 worth


of
 documents
 and
 you
 can't
 find
 anything


anywhere.
 So,
 in
 Windows,
 you'll
 click


system
 and
 then
 storage.
 And
 in
 here,


you
 can
 get
 rid
 of
 your
 temporary
 files.


That's
 an
 easy
 way
 to
 free
 up
 some
 space


and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 break
 anything


by
 doing
 that.
 Um,
 I
 also
 recommend


checking
 your
 downloads
 folder
 because
 a


lot
 of
 Croft
 ends
 up
 in
 there
 that


people
 forget
 about.


>> On
 Mac,
 you'll
 open
 the
 system
 settings


and
 go
 to
 general
 and
 then
 you'll
 click


storage
 and
 there's
 going to
 be
 a
 little


I
 symbol
 next
 to
 stuff.
 In
 there,
 you


can
 see
 what's
 taking
 up
 the
 most
 space


on
 your
 computer
 and
 you're
 going to
 get


rid
 of
 anything
 that
 you
 don't
 need.


Personally,
 in
 there,
 whenever
 I
 was


doing
 the
 research
 for
 this
 piece,
 I


found
 a
 2
 gig
 GarageBand
 sound
 library.


I'm
 never
 going
 to
 use
 that
 app.
 I
 got


rid
 of
 that.
 Isn't
 that
 what
 comes
 with


the
 laptop
 when
 you
 get
 it
 or
 that


something
 that
 was
 your
 own
 personal


project
 that
 you
 saved
 two
 years?


>> No,
 I've
 I've
 never
 opened
 GarageBand
 in


my
 entire
 human
 years
 on
 this
 earth.
 I


don't
 need
 it.
 It
 probably
 came
 with
 the


laptop.
 That's
 two
 gigs
 I
 could
 use
 for


anything
 else.


>> And
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 I
 know
 this
 is


such
 a
 basic
 question,
 but
 you
 drag
 all


this
 stuff
 into
 your
 little
 trash
 can,


right?
 And
 then
 you
 need
 to
 empty
 your


trash
 can.


>> That
 is
 correct.
 You
 do
 need
 to
 empty


your
 trash
 can
 or
 your
 recycle
 bin


whenever
 you're
 done.


>> But
 that's
 the
 scariest
 part.
 Like,


haven't
 you
 guys
 ever
 thrown
 away


something
 and
 then
 you
 put
 it
 out
 in
 the


dumpster
 and
 you
 realize
 that
 you


actually
 needed
 something
 in
 there?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 Kimber,
 what
 if
 the
 trash


person
 has
 come?
 What
 What
 do
 you
 do
 if


you've
 put
 something
 into
 the
 trash
 that


you're
 like,
 "Oh
 gosh,
 I
 didn't
 mean
 to


get
 rid
 of
 that.


>> It's
 gone."


>> Yeah.


>> See,
 don't
 tell
 me
 that.
 Okay.


>> That's
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 throw


things
 out.
 They're
 gone.


>> So,
 it
 turns
 out
 you
 can
 screw
 some


things
 up.


>> Is
 there
 a
 fail
 safe
 for
 that
 or
 an


extra
 security
 measure
 for
 it?
 Well,
 if


you
 have
 your
 things
 backed
 up
 to
 an


online
 backup
 service
 like
 the
 one
 Wire


Cutter
 recommends
 or
 to
 a
 separate


drive,
 um
 then
 you
 could
 probably
 get
 a


copy
 of
 your
 file
 from
 one
 of
 those


other
 locations
 if
 you
 have
 it
 there.
 Um


but
 otherwise,
 you
 really
 should
 just
 be


getting
 rid
 of
 garbage
 that
 you
 don't


need.


>> Otherwise,
 you
 just
 you
 embrace
 the


transients
 of
 life.


>> Yeah,
 you
 never
 you
 you've
 lost
 those


Bitcoin
 passwords
 never
 to
 them
 again.


>> Kyra
 could
 be
 rich
 on
 Bitcoin
 by
 now.


[Music]


So,
 next,
 let's
 talk
 about
 apps.
 What


should
 people
 know
 about
 the
 apps


installed
 on
 their
 computer
 and
 what


they're
 doing
 to
 potentially
 slow
 it


down?
 We've
 all
 installed
 apps
 for
 like


one
 specific
 task
 that
 you
 needed
 to
 get


done
 to
 like
 eign
 something
 or
 make
 one


particular
 clip
 of
 a
 PowerPoint
 and
 then


you
 forgot
 to
 un
 uninstall
 the
 app
 after


you
 were
 done.
 So
 again,
 it's
 a
 good


idea
 to
 take
 10,
 15
 minutes
 to
 go


through
 that
 list
 of
 apps
 and
 get
 rid
 of


anything
 that
 you
 don't
 need
 anymore.


This
 is
 going
 to
 free
 up
 even
 more
 drive


space
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 make
 your


computer
 feel
 faster
 by
 reducing
 the


number
 of
 things
 that
 you
 have
 running


at
 the
 same
 time
 in
 the
 background.


Windows
 laptops
 also
 come
 with
 a
 lot
 of


bloatware
 that
 you
 didn't
 ask
 for.
 Um,


>> what
 is
 bloat
 wear?
 I
 like
 that
 term.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it's
 it's
 what
 I
 wear
 during
 a


certain
 time
 of
 the
 month.


>> That's
 actually
 really
 funny.


Um,
 so
 this
 happens
 the
 most
 in
 cheap


Windows
 laptops
 that
 are
 under
 $500.


It'll
 come
 with
 stuff
 like
 random
 salad


games
 and
 like
 a
 a
 free
 trial
 of
 some


editing
 software.
 Like
 there's
 already


editing
 software
 in
 Windows.
 You
 don't


need
 all
 this
 other
 junk.
 So
 you
 should


go
 through
 and
 get
 rid
 of
 those
 things.


>> What
 about
 Apple?
 Are
 there
 things
 that


people
 should
 be
 looking
 out
 for,
 you


know,
 related
 to
 the
 apps
 that
 come


pre-installed
 on
 Apple
 computers?
 So,


Mac
 does
 not
 come
 with
 as
 much


pre-installed
 garbage
 and
 at
 least
 all


of
 it
 is
 like
 first
 party.
 It's
 from


Apple.
 Apple
 controls
 the
 operating


system,
 the
 hardware,
 all
 of
 that
 stuff.


So,
 it's
 only
 things
 that
 Apple
 wants


you
 to
 have.


>> Like
 GarageBand.


>> Like
 GarageBand.
 Exactly.
 So,
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 like
 random
 salad
 games,
 but


it
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be
 like
 I
 don't


need
 a
 2
 gig
 GarageBand
 sound
 library.


So,
 there
 are
 things
 you
 can
 get
 rid
 of,


but
 it's
 not
 as
 necessary.
 I
 recently


did
 this
 on
 my
 computer
 because
 it
 was


really
 slow
 and
 what
 I
 realized
 is
 my


daughter
 who
 is
 12
 and
 now
 uses
 a


computer
 for
 her
 homework
 had
 been
 using


my
 laptop
 and
 basically
 it's
 hers
 at


this
 point.
 Um
 but
 we
 have
 two
 different


profiles.
 So
 I
 log
 into
 my
 profile,
 she


logs
 into
 her
 profile
 and
 I
 think
 she


had
 downloaded
 some
 stuff.
 there
 was


some
 like
 graphics
 app
 that
 was
 running


a
 huge
 amount
 of
 the
 space
 on
 the


computer
 and
 when
 we
 sort
 of
 figured


that
 out
 and
 turned
 that
 off
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 the
 computer
 was
 really
 fast.
 So


if
 you
 are
 sharing
 your
 computer
 in
 a


household
 is
 there
 anything
 you
 should


watch
 out
 for
 there.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 basically
 just
 the


experience
 you
 described.
 So,
 you'll


want
 to
 have
 like
 an
 administrator


account
 so
 that
 you
 can
 see
 like
 what


everyone
 on
 the
 computer
 is
 doing.
 And


then
 your
 daughter's
 account
 would
 be
 an


account
 with
 less
 privileges
 basically.


Like
 she
 would
 need
 permissions
 to


install
 things
 and
 delete
 things
 and
 all


of
 that.
 And
 then
 your
 account
 would
 be


the
 one
 that
 can
 do
 all
 of
 that
 stuff.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 need
 to
 go
 back
 and
 do
 my


homework.
 And
 I
 like
 being
 called
 the


administrator.
 I
 will
 tell
 her
 that
 that


is
 my
 new
 role.


>> Bonus
 tip.
 You
 can
 also
 limit
 how
 many


apps
 launch
 whenever
 you
 start
 up
 your


computer,
 which
 is
 also
 going
 to
 help
 it


run
 faster.
 Whenever
 you
 launch
 your


computer,
 it's
 going
 to
 try
 and
 launch


all
 of
 the
 apps
 that
 it
 thinks
 you
 might


need,
 but
 you
 don't
 necessarily
 use
 them


all
 the
 time.
 So,
 you
 can
 go
 into
 the


list
 of
 applications
 on
 both
 Windows
 and


Mac
 and
 toggle
 off
 ones
 that
 you
 don't


want
 to
 launch
 whenever
 you
 boot
 up
 your


computer.
 And
 then
 you
 can
 just
 go


launch
 them
 the
 normal
 way
 that
 you
 need


to
 whenever
 you
 are
 actually
 going
 to


use
 that
 app.


>> That's
 I
 never
 thought
 about
 that.


>> Mhm.


>> Yeah.
 It
 helps
 speed
 up
 how
 slow
 your


computer
 is
 when
 it
 boots.
 Like
 a
 lot
 a


lot.


>> This
 is
 a
 wild
 card
 question,
 but
 do
 we


need
 to
 be
 turning
 our
 computers
 off
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day?


>> No,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 that.


>> Do
 we
 need
 to
 turn
 them
 off
 ever?


>> Sometimes
 yes.
 So
 you'll
 get
 a
 software


update
 and
 then
 it'll
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 would


like
 you
 to
 restart
 your
 computer."
 you


should
 do
 that,


>> right?


>> But
 otherwise,
 not
 really.
 They'll
 go
 to


sleep,
 they'll
 wake
 up.
 You
 don't
 really


need
 to
 do
 anything
 beyond
 that.


>> Hypothetically,
 if
 you
 never
 update
 your


computer,
 what
 happens
 then?
 I'm
 pulling


a
 rosie
 here.
 I'm
 asking
 for
 a
 friend.


Is
 that
 going
 to
 make
 everything
 slower


and
 and
 works?


>> Yes.
 And
 also,
 I
 come
 to
 your
 house
 with


a
 spray
 bottle.
 And


>> like,
 you're
 going
 to
 spray
 water
 on
 me


like
 I'm
 a
 cat.


>> Yes.
 Correct.
 Yeah.
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm


going
 to
 recommend
 you


>> I
 imagine.
 And
 tell
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,


Kimber,
 but
 if
 you're
 never
 installing


software
 updates,
 you're
 not
 necessarily


getting
 updated
 safety
 things
 that
 come


with
 new
 operating
 systems
 or
 or
 updates


to
 operating
 systems.
 Is
 that
 right?


Correct.
 So,
 if
 you
 take
 anything
 away


from
 this
 entire
 podcast,
 please
 update


your
 software.
 Please
 update
 your


operating
 system.
 Update
 your
 computer.


I
 know
 that
 we
 all
 get
 grouchy
 whenever


that
 popup
 shows
 up.
 You're
 in
 the


middle
 of
 something.
 you're
 busy,
 you


don't
 have
 time
 to
 restarting
 your
 whole


computer
 right
 now.
 Or
 on
 the
 other
 side


of
 that,
 okay,
 you
 updated
 your
 apps,


you
 updated
 your
 operating
 system,
 and


now
 nothing
 is
 where
 it
 was
 before
 and


you're
 just
 mad
 cuz
 the
 menus
 are


different.
 Even
 so,
 it
 is
 very
 important


to
 update
 your
 computer.
 This
 will
 help


keep
 your
 computer
 more
 secure.
 It
 will


also
 keep
 it
 running
 better
 than
 it
 did


before.
 Everything
 will
 be
 smoother.


It's
 a
 good
 thing
 to
 do,
 even
 if
 it's


annoying.


>> You
 hear
 that,
 Christine?


>> I
 hear
 it
 loud
 and
 clear.
 Thank
 you
 very


much.


[Music]


>> So,
 to
 recap,
 it
 sounds
 like
 fixing
 your


laptop
 at
 home
 isn't
 as
 scary
 as
 it


sounds,
 as
 long
 as
 you've
 got
 Kimber
 by


your
 side,
 at least.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 the


issues
 we
 experience,
 like
 a
 slow


startup
 or
 a
 quickly
 drained
 battery,


can
 be
 solved
 with
 three
 simple
 steps.


Number
 one
 is
 tidying
 up
 your
 files,


which
 is
 getting
 rid
 of
 anything
 that


you
 don't
 need
 and
 deleting
 it
 from
 your


trash
 can.
 Second
 is
 deleting
 or
 turning


off
 apps
 you
 never
 use.
 And
 third,


remember
 to
 update
 your
 operating


system.
 All right,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a


quick
 break.
 When
 we're
 back,
 Kimber
 is


going
 to
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 when
 to


consider
 throwing
 in
 the
 towel,
 getting


a
 new
 laptop,
 and
 how
 to
 find
 an


affordable
 one.


[Music]


Welcome
 back.
 Today
 we're
 talking
 with


Wire
 Cutter
 senior
 staff
 writer
 Kimber


streams
 about
 a
 piece
 that
 they
 wrote


that
 outlines
 all
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 can


make
 an
 old
 computer
 feel
 new
 again.
 All


right,
 Kimber,
 I've
 psyched
 myself
 up.


I've
 read
 your
 article.
 I've
 cleaned
 my


storage.
 I've
 taken
 an
 inventory
 of
 my


apps.
 I've
 checked
 what
 software
 my


computer
 is
 running.
 Updated
 all
 of
 the


things.
 and
 I'm
 still
 convinced
 it's
 not


functioning
 as
 well
 as
 it
 should.
 When


do
 you
 know
 it's
 time
 to
 give
 up
 on
 your


old
 computer
 and
 get
 a
 new
 one?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 great
 job.
 You
 did


all
 those
 things.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 show


up
 to
 your
 house
 with
 a
 spray
 bottle.


I'm
 just
 very
 proud
 that
 you
 did
 all
 of


those
 things.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 feel
 seen.


>> But
 now
 I
 have
 bad
 news
 for
 you.
 If
 your


computer
 is
 still
 frustratingly
 slow,


it's
 probably
 time
 to
 consider
 an


upgrade.


>> What
 should
 the
 average
 person
 be


looking
 for
 in
 a
 new
 machine?
 What's


important
 to
 pay
 attention
 to?
 What
 do


you
 not
 have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to?


>> The
 two
 biggest
 questions
 whenever


you're
 shopping
 for
 a
 new
 laptop
 that
 I


always
 ask
 everyone
 is
 what
 do
 you
 need


to
 do
 on
 the
 computer
 and
 how
 much
 can


you
 spend
 on
 the
 computer?
 They're


actually
 very
 like
 big
 picture
 questions


um
 that
 will
 kind
 of
 inform
 everything


else
 that
 comes
 after
 that.


>> So
 you
 mentioned
 earlier
 and
 this
 was


actually
 I
 thought
 a
 pretty
 hot
 take


that
 if
 you
 are
 spending
 more
 you're


likely
 going
 to
 get
 a
 better
 product.
 Is


that
 fair
 to
 say
 Kimber?


>> Yes
 absolutely.
 A
 laptop
 that's
 probably


$800
 or
 more
 is
 going
 to
 last
 you
 longer


than
 a
 cheaper
 laptop.
 That's
 generally,


in
 my
 experience
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 research


and
 testing
 over
 the
 years,
 that's
 kind


of
 where
 the
 cut
 off
 is.
 That's
 not
 to


say
 that
 every
 laptop
 over
 $800
 is
 great


and
 will
 definitely
 last
 you
 that
 long.


That's
 just
 to
 say
 that
 tends
 to
 be
 the


this
 is
 a
 a
 budget
 model
 where
 you're


making
 compromises
 versus
 this
 is
 a


really
 good
 laptop
 that's
 going
 to
 last


you.


>> Why
 is
 that?
 Is
 it
 because
 you're
 buying


more
 storage
 space?
 Is
 it
 because
 the


internal
 software
 is
 better?
 What
 makes


these
 800
 plus
 laptops
 last
 longer?
 It


is
 a
 combination
 of
 both
 the
 specs
 that


you're
 getting
 inside
 of
 the
 laptop.
 So,


the
 processor,
 the
 storage,
 the
 memory.


You're
 going
 to
 have
 faster
 and
 better


options
 in
 that
 higher
 price
 range,
 but


it
 is
 also
 partially
 the
 build
 quality


and
 the
 materials
 of
 those
 laptops.
 So,


to
 make
 a
 laptop
 cheaper,
 it's
 going
 to


cut
 corners.
 They're
 going
 to
 put
 a


crappier
 screen
 in
 it.
 The
 body
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 made
 out
 of
 metals
 like


aluminum.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 made
 out
 of


crappy
 plastic
 that
 caks
 and
 crunches


whenever
 you
 move
 it.
 So,
 it's
 not
 going


to
 really
 survive
 being
 thrown
 in
 a
 bag


and
 run
 all
 over
 the
 place
 the
 same
 way


that
 a
 higherend
 laptop
 will.


I
 often
 do
 see
 deals
 for
 relatively


cheap
 laptops,
 especially
 on
 Amazon.
 And


I
 feel
 like
 they're
 always
 trying
 to


push
 the
 lowest
 price
 for
 the
 most


unrecognizable
 product
 ever.
 But,
 you


know,
 if
 I'm
 shopping
 for
 a
 cheap


laptop,
 I
 wanted
 the
 price
 to
 be
 at


least
 $500
 or
 lower.
 I
 don't
 know
 how


realistic
 that
 is.
 So,
 baseline,
 how


much
 do
 you
 think
 people
 should
 expect


to
 be
 spending
 on
 a
 solid
 cheap
 PC?
 To


get
 a
 great
 PC,
 meaning
 one
 that's
 going


to
 last
 you
 at
 least
 5
 years,
 you
 do


typically
 need
 to
 spend
 at least
 $800.


Um,
 you
 can
 get
 a
 decent
 PC
 for
 under


$500,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 careful
 because


a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 pretty
 bad.


>> Meaning
 they
 just
 won't
 last
 that
 long.


>> Yes.
 Meaning
 they'll
 be
 bad
 the
 day
 you


get
 them.
 Like
 my
 college
 laptop.


>> Oh,
 right.
 And
 then
 it's
 just
 dead
 on


arrival
 essentially.


>> Yep.
 It's
 just
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 hard


time
 the
 whole
 time
 and
 then
 you'll
 have


to
 replace
 it
 sooner
 than
 if
 you
 had


just
 spent
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 money
 up


front
 in
 the
 first
 place.


>> Yeah.
 Super
 frustrating.
 Is
 it
 the
 same


with
 Macs,
 too?
 Macs
 have
 a
 reputation


for
 being
 more
 expensive,
 and


historically
 they
 have
 been,
 but
 Mac


prices
 are
 honestly
 really
 great
 right


now.
 Um,
 our
 top
 pick,
 the
 M4
 MacBook


Air,
 has
 regularly
 been
 on
 sale
 for


$800,
 which
 is
 a
 pretty
 bonkers
 price


for
 just
 a
 general
 purpose
 MacBook.


Walmart
 also
 still
 sells
 the
 2020


MacBook
 Air
 for
 about
 600
 bucks,
 which


is
 the
 best
 option
 if
 you're
 working
 on


a
 tight
 budget.
 That
 model
 is
 fast


enough
 for
 basic
 tasks,
 but
 it
 did
 come


out
 5
 years
 ago,
 so
 it
 struggles
 with


some
 more
 intense
 workloads
 and
 it's
 not


going
 to
 get
 new
 features
 like
 Apple


Intelligence.


>> Say
 you
 are
 in
 the
 market
 for
 a
 new


laptop.
 Christine,
 Rosie,
 and
 I
 all
 use


MacBooks,
 but
 do
 you
 think
 there's
 an


argument
 to
 be
 had
 about
 maybe
 switching


completely
 over
 to
 a
 PC?


>> PC
 versus
 Mac
 has
 been
 a
 very
 longunning


debate.
 You've
 seen
 the
 commercials
 with


John
 Hodgejman.
 Even
 though
 it's
 like
 a


longunning
 debate,
 I
 use
 both
 for
 work.


It's
 my
 job
 to
 use
 both.
 And
 my
 advice


is
 really
 just
 get
 whatever
 operating


system
 you're
 the
 most
 comfortable
 with.


Neither
 one
 is
 better
 than
 the
 other.
 If


you're
 not
 already
 wedded
 to
 a


particular
 operating
 system
 that
 you


love,
 that
 you
 know,
 that
 you're
 already


like
 deeply
 embedded
 in,
 you
 should


consider
 the
 other
 devices
 in
 your
 life


in
 that
 decision.
 So,
 do
 you
 already


have
 an
 iPhone?
 Do
 you
 have
 an
 Android


phone?
 And
 you
 should
 also
 consider
 how


easy
 it
 is
 to
 get
 support.
 So,
 if
 the


most
 techsavvy
 people
 in
 your
 life
 use


Windows
 or
 your
 school
 or
 company


provides
 support
 for
 Windows,
 then
 you


should
 get
 that.
 If
 you
 live
 near
 an


Apple
 store
 and
 you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to


take
 things
 there
 whenever
 they
 do
 break


for
 real
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you
 can't
 fix
 at


home,
 you
 should
 get
 a
 Mac.
 And
 let's


say
 I
 find
 a
 great
 deal
 on
 a
 budget


laptop
 and
 let's
 say
 it's
 a
 brand
 I've


never
 heard
 of.
 Would
 your
 advice
 be
 to


scoop
 up
 that
 deal
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 or
 pause
 because
 it
 might
 be
 a


scam?
 Please,
 please,
 please,
 please,


please
 do
 not
 just
 buy
 that
 random


laptop
 from
 a
 brand
 that
 you've
 never


heard
 of.
 I'm
 begging
 you.
 My
 advice
 is


to
 be
 patient.
 Check
 Wire
 Cutter.
 I
 have


advice
 for
 you.
 I
 have
 done
 all
 of
 the


research
 and
 testing
 to
 find
 cheap


laptops
 that
 are
 not
 bad.
 So,
 please
 do


not
 do
 that.


>> Before
 we
 move
 on,
 I
 want
 to
 know
 your


guidance
 for
 buying
 secondhand.
 Where


can
 you
 buy
 that's
 safe
 and
 reliable?


And
 how
 do
 you
 help
 folks
 determine


which
 is
 the
 best
 route?
 So,
 I
 would


always
 start
 with
 manufacturer


refurbished
 laptops,
 which
 means
 those


are
 straight
 from
 Apple,
 Dell,
 Lenovo,


HP,
 the
 first
 party
 manufacturers.
 These


refurbs
 are
 computers
 that
 have
 been


returned
 to
 the
 company
 that
 made
 them.


That
 company
 then
 repairs
 them
 with
 new


parts
 and
 then
 resells
 them
 in
 like
 new


condition
 with
 the
 same
 warranty
 that


you
 get
 on
 a
 new
 device.
 So
 that's
 the


best
 case
 scenario.


>> And
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 less
 expensive


but
 perhaps
 not
 as
 cheap
 as
 something


that's
 used.


>> Correct.
 Yes.


>> And
 what's
 the
 deal
 with
 used?


>> So
 used
 is
 for
 retailer
 refurbs
 from


sites
 like
 Best
 Buy
 or
 Newegg.
 In
 that


case,
 refurb
 is
 more
 just
 a
 fancy
 word


for
 used.
 You'll
 want
 to
 look
 for


excellent,
 like
 new,
 or
 very
 good


condition.
 And
 you
 want
 to
 look
 for
 the


longest
 warranty
 that
 you
 could
 possibly


get.
 So,
 if
 you
 can't
 go
 into
 a
 store


like
 a
 Best
 Buy
 and
 physically
 touch


that
 laptop
 to
 say
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 like


the
 condition
 it's
 in,"
 you
 want
 to
 look


for
 longer
 than
 90
 days.
 But
 you
 can
 get


away
 with
 a
 shorter
 warranty
 if
 you
 can


actually
 go
 check
 that
 laptop
 out
 in


person.


Kimber,
 I
 feel
 that
 you
 are
 our
 genius


bar.
 You're
 our
 laptop
 doctor,
 whatever


we
 want
 to
 call
 you.
 I
 want
 to
 throw
 you


a
 few
 questions
 of
 common
 problems
 that


people
 have
 with
 their
 laptop.
 Maybe


some
 of
 our
 listeners
 have
 with
 their


laptop.
 And
 I
 want
 you
 to
 diagnose
 the


problem.


>> Let's
 go.


>> Let's
 do
 it.
 Okay.
 My
 laptop
 is
 really


hot
 and
 the
 fan
 is
 really
 loud.
 So,


first
 step,
 dust
 out
 your
 laptop.
 If
 you


can
 see
 the
 fans,
 you
 can
 get
 some


compressed
 air.
 Dust
 the
 laptop
 out
 if


you
 can't
 really
 get
 in
 there.
 You
 can


also
 use
 a
 Q-tip
 and
 a
 toothpick
 to
 kind


of
 like
 pick
 any
 debris
 out
 of
 the
 vents


carefully.
 Another
 important
 thing
 is
 to


not
 block
 the
 fans.
 Sometimes
 it's
 like


up
 under
 the
 hinge,
 sometimes
 it's
 on


the
 sides,
 or
 sometimes
 it's
 on
 the


bottom
 of
 your
 laptop.
 If
 you're
 using


your
 your
 laptop
 on
 your
 lap
 or
 on
 a


pillow
 or
 on
 a
 blanket,
 like
 a
 lot
 of


people
 will
 just
 lay
 down
 with
 their


laptop
 all
 in
 their
 cozy
 zone,
 you're


probably
 blocking
 something
 you


shouldn't.
 We
 do
 have
 lap
 desk
 pickics


that
 will
 help
 with
 this.
 All
 right,


this
 one
 is
 my
 problem.
 My
 battery
 seems


to
 run
 out
 really
 quickly.
 So,
 the
 first


thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 to
 turn
 down
 your


screen
 brightness
 a
 little
 bit
 cuz
 the


brighter
 your
 screen
 is,
 the
 more
 energy


your
 laptop
 needs
 to
 power
 that.
 Also,


if
 you
 followed
 the
 recommendations
 from


earlier
 and
 you've
 cleared
 out
 some
 of


your
 apps,
 having
 fewer
 apps
 running
 all


at
 the
 same
 time
 in
 the
 background
 will


also
 help
 you
 use
 less
 battery.
 You
 can


also
 toggle
 on
 energy
 saver
 mode
 in


Windows
 or
 enable
 low
 power
 mode
 on
 Mac


if
 you're
 like
 really
 in
 a
 pinch
 and
 you


need
 to
 get
 through
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 day.


>> Okay,
 help.
 My
 laptop
 won't
 turn
 on.


Scary.
 Scariest
 one.


>> Yeah,


>> just
 absolutely
 terrifying.
 But
 don't


panic.
 That's
 step
 one.
 Don't
 panic.


Plug
 your
 laptop
 in
 and
 let
 it
 sit
 there


and
 charge
 for
 an
 hour
 or
 two.
 Then
 try


holding
 the
 power
 button
 down
 for
 at


least
 10
 seconds
 until
 it
 turns
 on.


>> Why
 10
 seconds?


>> That's
 going
 to
 do
 a
 hard
 reboot.
 So,


it's
 going
 to
 force
 shut
 down
 whatever


it
 was
 stuck
 on
 before
 and
 then
 turn
 it


back
 on
 fresh.


>> I
 need
 that
 like
 on
 on
 me
 like
 a
 hard.


Okay.
 Uh
 my
 keyboard
 and
 or
 my
 touchpad


are
 not
 responding.
 You
 can
 try


restarting
 your
 computers
 and
 hope
 the


gremlins
 that
 are
 living
 inside
 of
 their


leaf.
 If
 they
 haven't
 left
 yet
 by


restarting
 your
 computer,
 you'll
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 everything's
 updated
 with


the
 latest
 version
 of
 your
 operating


system,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 pull
 down


drivers,
 which
 is
 how
 your
 computer


talks
 to
 your
 keyboard
 and
 mouse.
 Well,


how
 are
 you
 supposed
 to
 figure
 that
 out


if
 your
 touchpad
 isn't
 working?
 Uh,
 plug


in
 an
 external
 mouse.
 We
 have
 the


technology.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 what
 in
 the


case
 for
 Rosie,
 if
 you
 spilled
 coffee
 or


soda
 or
 something
 on
 your
 laptop,
 what


then?
 Turn
 it
 off
 immediately.
 Shut
 it


down.
 Then
 flip
 it
 upside
 down.
 Just
 let


it
 dry
 out
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 for
 like
 a


day.
 Does
 rice
 work
 here?


>> No.
 Don't
 put
 your
 stuff
 in
 rice.
 Do
 not


put
 your
 tech
 in
 rice.


>> What?
 Not
 even
 your
 phone?
 No.
 Not
 even


your
 phone.


>> Okay.


>> We
 have
 a
 piece
 on
 the
 site
 that


explains
 what
 you
 are
 supposed
 to
 do,


which
 we
 will
 put
 in
 the
 show
 notes.


>> I
 dropped
 uh
 my
 phone
 in
 the
 bay
 like
 a


month
 ago
 and
 then
 put
 it
 in
 rice.
 And


spoiler
 alert.


>> Oh
 no.


>> I've
 got
 a
 new
 phone
 now.


Rosie,


>> I
 know.
 I
 know.
 I'm
 doing
 my
 best.


[Music]


Okay,
 Kimber,
 we're
 down
 to
 our
 final


question.
 What's
 the
 last
 thing
 you've


bought
 that
 you've
 really
 loved?
 I
 love


cross
 body
 bags
 that
 are
 really
 cute.


It's
 like
 my
 favorite
 way
 to
 like
 add


whimsy
 to
 an
 outfit.
 Back
 in


January,
 I
 think
 I
 shot
 a
 video
 with
 a


video
 team
 that
 also
 had
 my
 frog
 bag
 in


it.
 And
 everyone
 on
 Instagram
 wanted
 to


know
 about
 this
 custommade
 frog
 bag
 that


I
 had.
 The
 bag
 is
 a
 frog.
 He's
 very
 long


and
 green.
 And
 he's
 got
 big
 eyeballs.


And
 when
 you
 unzip
 his
 mouth,
 it's
 red


on
 the
 inside.
 And
 then
 you
 put


everything
 into
 his
 mouth.
 And
 then
 he's


got
 long
 little
 goofy
 arms.


>> Cute.
 I
 like
 it.


>> So
 there's
 a
 shop
 called
 uh
 Chimera


Bunny.
 It's
 like
 a
 couple
 of
 artists


work
 together
 to
 like
 design
 these
 bags.


So
 earlier
 this
 week,
 I
 got
 the
 sequel


to
 the
 frog
 bag.
 This
 one
 is
 a
 Pac-Man


frog.
 So
 he's
 very
 round
 and
 yellow


>> and
 he
 looks
 absolutely
 ridiculous.


>> Oh
 my
 goodness,
 that
 is
 so
 cute.


>> Yeah,
 I
 love
 that.


>> So
 this
 this
 is
 what's
 bringing
 me
 joy


right
 now.
 Kimber,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


Really
 appreciate
 you
 coming
 on
 and
 uh


appreciate
 all
 your
 recommendations
 and


insight.
 Come
 back
 soon.
 here
 to
 help.


[Music]


>> All right.
 Do
 you
 feel
 more
 educated?
 Do


you
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 what
 to
 do
 with


your
 laptops?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 know
 how
 to
 handle
 the


ghost
 in
 the
 machine
 now.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Great,
 great,
 great,
 great.


>> As
 as
 often
 happens
 at
 the
 end
 of
 these


episodes,
 I
 feel
 slightly
 more


empowered.


>> Yeah.
 Educated.


>> It
 doesn't
 seem
 as
 hard
 as
 I've
 been


making
 it
 to
 be
 in
 my
 own
 head.
 One
 of


my
 takeaways
 is
 that
 if
 you
 pay
 more
 for


a
 laptop,
 you
 often
 are
 getting
 more.


>> Hard
 pill
 to
 swallow,
 honestly.
 Um,
 but


the
 other
 thing
 is
 that
 you
 can
 kind
 of


choose
 your
 own
 adventure
 for
 operating


system.
 If
 you
 are
 a
 PC
 person,
 go
 PC.


If
 you're
 a
 Mac
 person,
 go
 Mac.
 It's


whatever
 works
 for
 you,
 whatever
 works


for
 your
 life.
 You
 know,
 my
 takeaway
 is


I
 am
 going
 to
 take
 one
 of these


Saturdays
 coming
 up
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 sit


with
 Kimber's
 article
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 step
 by
 step
 on
 how
 to
 clean
 up
 all


the
 different
 things
 on
 my
 computer


because
 it
 has
 been
 really
 slow
 and


sluggish
 and
 I've
 been
 wondering,
 do
 I


need
 to
 get
 a
 new
 one?
 Kind
 of
 in
 the


same
 vein,
 I
 need
 to
 get
 my
 digital


household
 in
 order.
 I
 know
 that
 I


constantly
 put
 stuff
 in
 my
 trash
 can,


but
 then
 I
 never
 actually
 delete
 the


stuff
 in
 the
 trash
 can
 because
 I'm


scared.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 the
 same


thing.
 I'm
 going
 to
 sit
 down,
 make
 sure


I'm
 not
 about
 to
 delete
 anything
 forever


that
 I
 will
 need
 again.
 And
 I
 think
 that


will
 make
 my
 laptop
 a
 little
 bit
 faster.


And
 then
 one
 of
 the
 tangential
 things


that
 I
 learned
 from
 Kimber
 today
 is
 that


rice
 is
 not
 the
 option
 when
 you
 drop


water
 or
 any
 liquid
 on
 any
 of
 your
 tech.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 had
 no
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 You're
 just
 going
 to
 get
 like
 wet


sticky
 rice
 on
 your
 devices.
 So
 yeah,


>> the
 more
 you
 know.


>> Yes.


>> Well,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 find
 out
 more
 about


any
 of
 Kimber's
 reporting,
 all
 of
 it
 is


so
 helpful.
 The
 piece
 we've
 referenced


today
 is
 called
 How
 to
 Make
 Your
 Old


Computer
 Feel
 New
 Again.
