Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 This
 is
 the
 last


daily
 recap
 for
 the
 week
 as
 we
 have
 come


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week
 on
 Thursday.


Thank
 you
 again
 to
 everyone
 who's
 been


showing
 support
 on
 these
 episodes.
 I


really
 do
 love
 making
 them
 every
 day
 and


I'm
 happy
 that
 people
 are
 enjoying
 them.


Uh
 today
 was
 a
 red
 day
 in
 the
 stock


market
 and
 we've
 got
 some
 things
 to
 talk


about
 about
 why
 it
 was
 red.
 We're
 going


to
 spend
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time
 on
 the


first
 subject
 today
 which
 is
 the


regional
 banking
 crisis.
 I
 say
 crisis
 in


a
 hyperbolic
 way.
 It's
 not
 a
 crisis
 yet,


but
 the
 market
 is
 acting
 like
 it
 could


become
 a
 crisis.
 And
 whenever
 the
 market


thinks
 something
 can
 become
 a
 crisis,


you
 tend
 to
 get
 a
 sell
 off.
 We
 got
 some


other
 updates
 with
 Bitmine,
 Pounder.


We'll
 talk
 about
 that
 stuff,
 but
 let's


get
 into
 why
 stocks
 are
 red
 and
 what's


going
 on
 with
 regional
 banks.
 Okay,
 so


yesterday
 we
 ended
 green,
 but
 we
 had
 a


couple
 of
 China
 hiccups,
 especially


based
 on
 some
 comments
 that
 Bent
 had


made
 that
 kind
 of
 allowed
 the
 market
 to


feel
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 scared
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 US
 and
 China.


Now,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 US
 and
 China


relations
 because
 we
 do
 have
 a
 little


bit
 of
 an
 update
 on
 that
 and
 uh
 that


that
 update
 is
 actually
 good.
 It's
 not


that
 counterproductive
 in
 terms
 of


what's
 going
 on
 with
 US
 and
 China.
 But


today,
 we're
 going
 back
 to
 March
 2023.


And
 if
 anyone
 remembers
 what
 happened
 in


March
 of
 2023,
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 had


collapsed.
 The
 Fed
 had
 raised
 rates
 the


highest
 in
 40
 years
 in
 2022
 up
 until


sort
 of
 the
 end
 of
 2023.
 there
 was


probably
 going
 to
 be
 some
 collateral


damage
 because
 a
 lot
 of these
 regional


banks,
 regional
 banks
 are
 not
 the
 JP


Morgans,
 the
 cities,
 the
 Well
 Fargo,
 but


rather
 the
 truest
 which
 are
 located
 more


in
 the
 south
 of
 America.
 They
 are


regional
 to
 a
 demographic
 and
 that's
 why


they're
 called
 regional
 banks.
 Silicon


Valley
 Bank
 catered
 towards
 a
 lot
 of
 the


tech
 elite
 in
 Silicon
 Valley,


California.
 And
 unfortunately,
 they
 took


on
 some
 risk
 when
 rates
 were
 low
 that


they
 probably
 shouldn't
 have
 taken
 on
 in


case
 rates
 went
 up.
 They
 didn't
 think


rates
 would
 go
 up.
 Guess
 what?
 rates


went
 up
 and
 they
 ended
 up
 getting


liquidated.
 So
 that
 created
 a
 bit
 of
 a


crisis
 back
 in
 2023.
 Now
 it
 didn't


really
 turn
 into
 some
 massive
 issue
 that


would
 cause
 something
 like
 2008
 again,


but
 it
 was
 isolated
 to
 the
 regional


banks
 and
 the
 markets
 had
 a
 bit
 of
 a


hiccup
 and
 ultimately
 we
 got
 through


that.
 Today
 there
 are
 fears
 in
 the
 stock


market
 which
 is
 why
 stocks
 ended
 red
 on


the
 day
 about
 regional
 banks.
 Now
 what


is
 the
 fear
 and
 what
 exactly
 was
 the


catalyst
 to
 create
 this
 fear?
 Well,
 we


have
 to
 go
 to
 the
 culprit
 of
 what's


going
 on,
 which
 is
 obviously
 a
 bank


earnings
 because
 if
 some
 of
 the
 regional


banks
 gave
 their
 earnings,
 which
 they


did
 today.
 So,
 number
 one
 is
 Zion's


Bank.
 They
 came
 out
 today.
 They
 had
 a


record
 60
 million
 credit
 provision
 and
 a


charge
 off
 of
 50
 million.
 And
 then


Western
 Alliance
 Bank
 said
 that
 they
 had


filed
 a
 lawsuit
 in
 August
 alleging
 fraud


by
 a
 borrower
 in
 failing
 to
 provide


collateral
 loans
 in
 the
 first
 position.


Essentially,
 two
 regional
 banks
 came
 out


today
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 think
 we
 have


some
 bad
 loans.
 We
 are
 having
 some


credit
 issues.
 These
 might
 be
 oneoff


issues,
 but
 nonetheless,
 like
 you
 know,


when
 you're
 a
 public
 company,
 you
 can't


hide
 this
 stuff.
 Um,
 we
 have
 some
 bad


issues
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 loans
 that
 we


are
 dispersing.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 Jeffre


went
 down
 7.9%.
 Truis
 was
 down
 10%.
 The


KRE
 regional
 banking
 index
 was
 down


almost
 7%.
 A
 firm
 block,
 PayPal,
 CLA,


all
 the
 other
 fintexs
 were
 down
 on
 the


day.
 One
 of
 the
 analysts
 about
 a
 note
 in


Zions
 that
 he
 wrote
 today.
 Is
 it
 a
 good


thing
 or
 a
 bad
 thing
 in
 credit
 terms
 if


these
 loans
 went
 bad
 due
 to
 fraud
 or
 as


opposed
 to
 the
 normal
 course
 of


business?
 Either
 way,
 there
 have
 been


enough
 one-offs
 in
 commercial
 credits
 of


banks
 as
 of
 lately
 that
 investors
 are


selling
 first
 and
 asking
 questions


later.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the


moral
 of
 the
 story.
 It
 seems
 like
 more


investors
 are
 selling
 first
 versus


asking
 questions
 later.
 We
 had
 a
 3%
 draw


down
 on
 Friday.
 Everything
 feels
 a
 bit


frothy.
 By
 the
 way,
 rare
 earth
 stocks


crushed
 today.
 Uh
 quantum
 stocks
 crushed


today.
 Nuclear
 stocks
 crushed
 today.


Bitcoin
 miners
 turned
 data
 center
 stocks


crushed
 today.
 And
 I
 think
 are
 they


structurally
 dead
 because
 of
 momentum


that
 has
 completely
 faded
 out
 of
 those


names.
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 going
 to
 take


I
 think
 at least
 a
 couple
 weeks
 to
 see


if
 the
 momentum's
 gone
 and
 if
 those


stocks
 are
 just
 going
 to
 turn
 a
 lot
 of


people
 into
 bag
 holders
 or
 if
 those


stocks
 are
 taking
 a
 breather
 because
 you


know
 even
 if
 they
 fell
 20
 to
 30%
 some
 of


them
 would
 be a
 four
 to
 5x
 still
 on
 the


year
 which
 is
 just
 incredible.
 So
 it


might
 just
 be
 them
 taking
 a
 breather.
 It


might
 be
 something
 structural
 we're


going to
 have
 to
 see
 over
 the
 coming


weeks,
 but
 credit
 concerns
 across
 the


entire
 market
 are
 always
 a
 reason
 for


why
 investors
 would
 sell
 first
 and
 ask


questions
 later.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 that


is
 because
 when
 there
 is
 a
 credit


problem
 in
 an
 economy,
 you
 have


cascading
 effects
 across
 the
 entire


market.
 Consumers
 need
 to
 borrow
 money


to
 do
 things.
 To
 buy
 a
 car,
 you
 need
 to


take
 a
 loan,
 to
 buy
 a
 house,
 you
 need
 to


get
 a
 mortgage,
 uh
 to
 buy
 everyday


products
 and
 services.
 Most
 people
 need


to
 take
 on
 credit
 card
 debt.
 When
 there


are
 credit
 issues,
 aka
 massive


delinquencies
 or
 problems
 in
 the


underlying
 structure
 of
 credit
 in
 the


United
 States
 or
 in
 any
 country,
 banks


aren't
 that
 easy
 to
 lend
 money
 for.
 Uh


companies
 start
 pulling
 back
 their
 spend


on
 marketing,
 hiring
 new
 people
 because


they
 say,
 "Hey,
 if
 there's
 some
 credit


issues,
 then
 we
 need
 to
 reserve
 our


right
 to
 be
 able
 to
 utilize
 this
 capital


in
 more
 efficient
 ways."
 And
 overall


risk
 on
 sentiment
 starts
 to
 come
 down.


So,
 these
 were
 two
 regional
 banks
 today


that
 said
 they
 had
 some
 issues.
 It's
 not


like
 these
 uh
 are
 you
 know
 the
 the
 most


important
 banks
 in
 the
 country.
 JP


Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 Black
 Rockck,


Cityroup,
 Wells
 Fargo,
 Bank
 of
 America,


Morgan
 Stanley,
 they
 did
 not
 say
 any


credit
 issues
 were
 a
 massive
 concern.
 In


fact,
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 City
 Bank
 yesterday


literally
 said
 on
 their
 earnings
 call


delinquencies
 came
 in
 lower
 than


expected,
 which
 to
 me
 is
 a
 great
 sign
 in


terms
 of
 the
 health
 of
 the
 consumer.
 So


then
 the
 question
 becomes
 in
 the
 context


of
 the
 broader
 market
 are
 regional
 banks


and
 our
 issues
 in
 credit
 within
 those


regional
 banks
 specific
 enough
 and
 quite


frankly
 harmful
 enough
 for
 the
 entire


economy
 to
 now
 be
 afraid
 of
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 based
 on
 those
 regional
 banks.


I
 don't
 think
 the
 answer
 is
 yes.
 My
 gut


feeling
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 I
 actually


bought
 truest
 TFC
 which
 is
 a
 regional


bank
 back
 in
 2023.
 Put
 some
 options
 on


it.
 Shout
 out
 to
 our
 friend
 Chris
 Patel


who
 really
 taught
 me
 how
 to
 do
 call


debit
 spreads.
 And
 he
 really
 said
 you


need
 to
 look
 at
 truest.
 And
 that's
 when


I
 kind
 of
 learned
 how
 to
 do
 some
 more


due
 diligence
 on
 banks.
 Truis
 got
 to


$27.
 Right
 now
 today
 it's
 at
 like
 41.
 It


got
 to
 a
 peak
 of
 like
 48
 a
 couple
 months


ago.
 And
 truest


um
 truest
 is
 is
 one
 of
 the
 leading


regional
 banks
 in
 the
 south
 part
 of
 the


United
 States
 of
 America.
 And
 they
 had


no
 fundamental
 underlying
 issues.
 It's


just
 when
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 collapsed,


well,
 you
 know,
 every
 regional
 bank
 was


in
 question.
 And
 so
 you
 were
 able
 to
 buy


it
 at
 an
 11-year
 low
 and
 ride
 it
 back


up.
 and
 the
 options
 created
 some
 more


leverage
 on
 that
 trade
 as
 well.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 the
 regional
 banks
 are
 in
 that


type
 of
 an
 opportunity
 where
 you
 know


truis
 gets
 back
 down
 to
 $27
 gets
 to
 an


11-year
 low.
 But
 if
 that
 does
 happen,
 it


says
 one
 of
 two
 things.
 Number
 one,


either
 there
 is
 a
 structural
 credit


problem
 in
 America
 and
 the
 regional


banks
 are
 where
 the
 contagion
 is
 in


which
 will
 spread
 pretty
 quickly.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 be
 pretty
 if
 the
 regional


banks
 have
 this
 underlying
 issue.
 So
 I


think
 the
 most
 important
 earnings


outside
 of
 tech
 earnings
 now
 because
 of


today
 have
 become
 regionals.


Everyone
 needs
 to
 focus
 on
 what
 the


regional
 banks
 are
 saying
 or
 number
 two.


This
 is
 a
 one-off
 and
 it's
 not
 that
 big


of
 a
 deal.
 And
 I'm
 leaning
 towards


number
 two
 because
 the
 big
 banks
 are


saying
 we're
 okay
 now.
 The
 big
 banks
 are


not
 the
 entire
 story.
 But
 if
 the
 big


banks
 are
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 story,


then
 this
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 buy
 the
 dip


opportunity.
 I
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 today.
 I


bought
 more
 Grab,
 bought
 more
 Amazon.
 I


think
 all
 stocks
 are
 going
 down


algorithmically.
 There's
 no
 reason
 for
 a


lot
 of these
 stocks
 to
 be
 down
 five,


seven,
 seven%
 on
 the
 day
 outside
 of
 if


there
 is
 a
 structural
 credit
 problem
 in


this
 country,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 too
 soon


to
 say.
 So,
 the
 regional
 banks
 are
 the


reason
 we
 went
 red
 today.
 The
 regional


banks
 might
 be
 the
 reason
 we
 continue
 to


be
 red.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 do
 with


China.
 Doesn't
 have
 to
 do
 with
 Trump's


announcement
 at
 3
 p.m.
 in
 the
 Oval


Office,
 which
 is
 about
 in
 vitro


fertilization.
 We
 thought
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 about
 the
 markets.
 That's
 not
 what


it's
 about.
 Uh,
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with


regional
 banks.
 And
 so,
 now
 the
 question


becomes,
 how
 bad
 of
 an
 issue
 would
 this


will
 this
 be?
 And
 we
 will
 find
 out.
 I


mean,
 again,
 you
 got
 some
 of
 the


analysts
 on
 these
 reports
 saying
 maybe


Zion's
 and
 Western
 Alliance
 was
 just
 a


one-time
 charge
 off,
 but
 investors
 would


rather
 sell
 first
 and
 find
 out
 later


versus
 hold
 on
 to
 the
 ride
 if
 there
 is
 a


contagion
 in
 the
 regional
 banks.
 So,
 for


the
 coming
 future,
 we
 will
 definitely
 be


paying
 attention
 to
 what's
 going
 on
 with


the
 regionals.
 Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about


Bitine
 and
 Mr.
 Tom
 Lee.
 Um,
 Bitmine


today
 got
 one
 of
 its
 first
 institutional


upgrades,
 which
 was
 quite
 incredible
 to


see.
 Uh,
 because
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


analysts
 actually
 covering
 the
 stock.


Again,
 Bitmine
 is
 an
 Ethereum
 treasury.


Um,
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 the
 chairman
 of
 the


company.
 B.
 Riley


initiates
 coverage,
 $90
 price
 target,


indicating
 a
 70%
 upside
 from
 current


prices.
 Here's
 what
 they
 say.
 We
 are


initiating
 coverage
 of
 BMR
 with
 a
 buy


rating
 and
 a
 $90
 price
 target.
 Bit
 mine


is
 the
 largest
 Ethereum
 digital
 asset


treasury
 with
 an
 experienced
 management


team
 and
 what
 we
 believe
 are
 achievable


plans
 to
 acquire
 a
 5%
 stake
 in
 the


Ethereum
 network
 which
 is
 this
 kind
 of


alchemy
 of
 5%
 that
 Tomloo
 talks
 about.


We
 expect
 the
 shares
 to
 continue
 trading


at
 a
 premium
 1.3
 to
 1.5x
 I
 think
 right


now
 it's
 around
 1.3x
 driven
 by
 ETH


staking
 revenue
 institutional
 custody


partnerships
 with
 leading
 service


providers
 and
 a
 strong
 capital
 raising


capability
 thanks
 to
 the
 current
 premium


valuation.
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 one
 of
 those


ambassadors
 that
 knows
 how
 to
 raise


money
 and
 effectively
 allocate
 that


capital.
 We
 project
 that
 BMR
 will
 hold


approximately
 7.6
 million
 ETH
 by
 fiscal


year
 2026
 end,
 which
 would
 be
 more
 than


5%
 of
 the
 entire
 Ethereum
 network


subject
 to
 market
 conditions
 and
 capital


availability.
 So,
 I
 thought
 this
 was


pretty
 interesting
 today
 because


essentially
 you
 have
 some
 institutional


investors
 coming
 out.
 Devon
 Ryan,
 by
 the


way,
 he
 was
 one
 of
 the
 only


institutional
 analysts
 that
 was
 bullish


on
 Robin
 Hood
 at
 $8
 in
 2022.
 He


initiated
 coverage
 on
 SBET,
 which
 is
 a


competitor
 to
 Bitmine,
 uh
 $50
 price


target.
 So,
 he's
 not
 putting
 out


coverage
 on
 Bitmine,
 but
 he's
 putting


out
 coverage
 on
 their
 competitor.
 And
 it


was
 quite
 fascinating
 to
 me
 that
 a
 lot


of
 these
 financial
 guys
 on
 Wall
 Street


that
 cover
 banks
 and
 fintech
 and
 all


this
 stuff
 are
 now
 covering
 Ethereum
 and


digital
 asset
 treasuries
 rooted
 in
 the


underlying
 asset
 that
 is
 Ethereum.
 And


the
 only
 justification
 I
 have
 for
 it
 is


that
 I
 think
 these
 Wall
 Street
 guys
 are


speaking
 to
 other
 Wall
 Street
 guys.
 And


when
 you're
 speaking
 to
 the
 Wall
 Street


guys,
 this
 is
 what
 Tom
 Lee's
 been


saying.
 Wall
 Street
 is
 becoming
 obsessed


with
 tokenizing
 everything
 onchain,


bringing
 assets
 on
 chain.
 Larry
 Frink


was
 talking
 about
 the
 multi-t
 trillion


dollar
 opportunity
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 of


bringing
 all
 these
 assets
 on
 chain.
 Vlad


Tennant,
 CEO
 Robin
 said
 the
 financial


network
 will
 be
 eaten
 up
 by


tokenization.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 a
 lot
 of


these
 uh
 Wall
 Street
 analysts
 are


realizing
 that
 Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 be


inextricably
 linked
 with
 the
 financial


sector,
 particularly
 with
 Wall
 Street.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 it's
 hard
 to
 ignore
 it.


And
 if
 it
 becomes
 really
 hard
 to
 ignore


it,
 that
 means
 that
 you
 need
 to
 have


exposure
 to
 it.
 That
 means
 you
 probably


need
 to
 tell
 your
 clients
 to
 get
 some


exposure
 to
 it.
 And
 that
 exposure
 seems


like
 it's
 coming
 through
 the
 form
 of
 an


ETH
 treasury,
 potentially
 BMR.
 Now


another
 update
 on
 Ethereum
 and
 this


leads
 back
 to
 the
 argument
 around


Bitmine
 as
 well
 is
 Jove
 which
 is
 a


Ethereum
 layer
 2
 blockchain
 for
 real


world
 assets
 and
 users
 by
 Ant
 Digital


Technologies
 Ant
 Group
 one
 of the


largest
 financial
 institutions
 in
 China


is
 now
 building
 on
 Ethereum.
 And
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 this
 is
 really
 important
 is


because
 Alipe
 and
 its
 1.4
 4
 billion


monthly
 active
 users
 in
 China
 which


processes
 8.7
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 volume


have
 launched
 on
 Jovi
 which
 is
 an


Ethereum
 L2.
 So
 Jovi
 is
 an
 Ethereum
 L2


launched
 by
 the
 Ank
 group
 and
 Alip
 pay


is
 a
 payment
 infrastructure
 in
 China


that
 1.4
 billion
 monthly
 users
 use
 that


now
 will
 get
 access
 to
 being
 able
 to


trade
 transact
 etc
 on
 a
 layer
 2
 a
 layer


2
 underneath
 Ethereum
 called
 Joy.
 That


means
 1.4
 four
 billion
 people
 in
 China


out
 of
 all
 places.
 China
 has
 not
 been


the
 most
 friendliest
 to
 crypto
 just
 got


access
 to
 being
 able
 to
 work
 on
 chain


and
 the
 the
 chain
 of
 choice
 that
 they


picked
 is
 not
 Salana,
 it's
 not
 Bitcoin


Bitcoin,
 it's
 not
 their
 own
 layer
 1,


it's
 a
 layer
 two
 on
 Ethereum.
 Robin's


entire
 tokenization
 is
 a
 layer
 two
 on


Ethereum.
 So
 again,
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 BMR.


I
 mean,
 regardless
 of
 what's
 happening


to
 the
 stock,
 regardless
 of
 what's


happening
 to
 Ethereum's
 price,
 which
 is


under
 4,000
 today,
 if
 you
 believe
 in


that
 overall
 ecosystem
 developing,


growing,
 bringing
 more
 people
 into
 uh


what
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


revolutions
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Wall


Street
 and
 crypto
 and
 the
 intersection


of
 that
 taking
 place
 on
 Ethereum,
 the


asset
 that
 Bit
 continues
 to
 buy
 is


Ethereum.
 And
 they
 have
 continued
 to
 be


able
 to
 do
 this
 at
 a
 premium.
 As
 long
 as


they
 can
 keep
 doing
 it
 at
 a
 premium,


that
 premium
 will
 expand
 as
 long
 as


Ethereum
 also
 continues
 to
 go
 up.
 if
 the


thesis
 for
 Ethereum
 plays
 out,
 which


means
 long
 term,
 you
 know,
 the
 reason
 I


continue
 to
 own
 Bitmine
 is
 because
 I


think
 that
 thesis
 does
 play
 out.
 So,


nice
 to
 see
 a
 $90
 upgrade
 on
 Bitmine
 for


the
 first
 time
 uh
 since
 the
 company
 went


public
 and
 actually
 getting
 some


institutional
 coverage.
 And
 I
 think
 we


will
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 that
 in
 the


future.
 All right,
 last
 update
 for
 the


day.
 Palanteer
 and
 Snowflake,
 folks,


they
 are
 working
 together.
 And
 I
 know


this
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 for
 some
 people


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 never
 thought


that
 Palanteer
 and
 Snowflake
 would
 ever


work
 together.
 Uh
 but
 they
 are.
 Pounder


and
 Snowflake
 are
 teaming
 up
 to
 start
 a


partnership
 for
 enterprise
 ready
 AI
 and


analytics.
 One
 of
 their
 flagship


customers,
 Eaton,
 which
 I've
 actually


interviewed
 some
 of
 the
 executives
 at


Eaten
 at
 AIPCON
 for
 Palare,
 is


leveraging
 the
 integration
 to
 deliver


enhanced
 business
 outcomes
 and


streamline
 enterprisewide
 governance.


So,
 let's
 back
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 What
 is


going
 on
 right
 here?
 Why
 is
 Palanteer


working
 with
 Snowflake?
 Chad,
 one
 of
 the


Palunteer
 AIP
 architects,
 came
 on
 my


channel
 a
 couple
 months
 ago
 and


basically
 said
 that
 Palunteer
 has


started
 to
 shift
 their
 approach
 from


being
 super
 competitive
 with
 a
 customer


if
 they
 are
 on
 Snowflakes
 and
 data


bricks
 to
 just
 saying,
 hey,
 what
 if
 you


could
 keep
 your
 data
 system
 the
 way
 it


is
 and
 integrate
 with
 us
 so
 that
 you


don't
 have
 to
 leave
 snowflake
 and
 data


bricks
 but
 you
 can
 work
 with
 us.
 So


instead
 of
 trying
 to
 convince
 them,
 hey,


leave
 Snowflake,
 leave
 data
 bricks,


which
 is
 not
 an
 easy
 thing
 to
 do
 for


some
 of
 these
 large
 CL
 customers,
 what


if
 you
 could
 just
 keep
 your
 data
 stored


on
 whatever
 different
 data
 provider
 you


have,
 but
 use
 us
 to
 integrate
 an


ontology
 and
 actually
 get
 the
 value
 that


Pounder
 provides.
 And
 Chad
 talked
 about


this
 as
 essentially
 launching
 an


interoperable
 way
 for
 Paler
 to
 have
 a


better
 go
 to
 market
 approach
 into
 the


enterprise
 which
 for
 us
 as
 shareholders


of
 Paler,
 we
 really
 want
 to
 see
 them
 be


able
 to
 break
 into
 the
 enterprise
 in
 a


more
 meaningful
 way
 and
 continue
 the


commercial
 growth
 that
 they've
 had


success
 with
 without
 having
 to
 be
 super


competitive
 with
 all
 these
 companies


that
 are
 already
 using
 the
 Snowflake
 or


data
 bricks
 which
 have
 thousands
 of


sales
 people.
 So
 obviously
 they're
 going


to
 have
 an
 advantage
 over
 Palter
 in


terms
 of
 just
 being
 able
 to
 get
 more


customers.
 Snowflake
 has
 like
 10,000


customers.
 Pal
 has
 900.
 But
 if
 Pounder


can
 just
 work
 with
 those
 customers,


things
 start
 to
 become
 a
 lot
 more
 easy.


So
 the
 chief
 revenue
 officer
 of


Snowflake
 said
 bringing
 the
 power
 of


Pounder
 and
 Snowflake
 platforms
 together


is
 a
 natural
 fit
 aimed
 at
 reducing


friction
 for
 customers
 to
 more
 easily


deploy
 intelligent
 apps
 and
 accelerate


time
 to
 value.
 Ted
 may
 global
 head
 of


commercial
 at
 Paler
 said
 first
 class


interoperability
 means
 our
 customers


win.
 We
 are
 excited
 to
 partner
 with


Snowflake
 to
 power
 our
 customers
 futures


together
 with
 the
 Eaton
 setting
 the


standard
 of
 what
 the
 AI
 powered


institution
 of
 the
 future
 will
 look


like.
 Now
 what
 did
 Eaton
 have
 to
 say


about
 this?
 The
 co
 chief
 data
 officer


says
 discoverability,
 accessibility,
 and


usability
 are
 key
 to
 unlocking
 the
 value


of
 our
 data
 assets
 for
 the
 business.


With
 a
 native
 integration
 between


Snowflake
 and
 Palantry
 are
 two
 of
 our


strategic
 technology
 partners,
 we


eliminate
 tedious
 data
 movements,


allowing
 us
 to
 focus
 on
 delivering


outcomes
 ranging
 from
 agentic


configuration,
 pricing
 and
 quoting
 to


digital
 twins
 on
 our
 shop
 floor
 and


improve
 servicing
 of
 our
 products
 in
 the


field.
 Essentially
 saying,
 hey,
 when
 we


can
 integrate
 both
 together,
 we
 don't


need
 to
 pick
 one
 or
 the
 other.
 We
 can


pay
 both.
 We
 might
 not
 be
 paying
 uh
 one


of
 them
 all
 the
 money.
 We
 might
 be


splitting
 it,
 but
 we're
 getting
 twice


the
 value.
 And
 if
 we're
 getting
 all
 the


value
 from
 the
 software
 providers,


that's
 what
 really
 matters.
 And
 as
 long


as
 Palanteer
 is
 getting
 the
 clients
 and


some
 of
 the
 upside
 and
 the
 revenue,


that's
 what
 matters
 for
 Palante's


business.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 super


bullish
 for
 Palanteer.
 I
 think
 they
 will


continue
 to
 be
 able
 to
 uh
 have
 a


precedent
 of
 being
 able
 to
 scale
 into


the
 enterprise.
 And
 if
 they
 continue
 to


do
 that,
 commercial
 growth
 should


continue
 to
 be
 very
 strong.
 All right,


that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank
 everybody
 for


listening
 and
 watching.
 This
 is
 the
 last


daily
 recap
 for
 the
 week.
 Hopefully


these
 daily
 recaps
 have
 really
 been


helpful
 in
 keeping
 people
 updated
 in


terms
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 markets.


I
 know
 today
 was
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 weird


day
 with
 the
 regional
 banks.
 We
 will


keep
 a
 very
 strong
 eye
 on
 what's


happening
 with
 regional
 banks
 and


ultimately
 uh
 if
 this
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a


larger
 implication
 long
 term,
 but
 I


appreciate
 everyone
 keeping
 up
 with
 the


channel.
 Markets
 go
 up,
 markets
 go
 down.


I'll
 be
 here
 every
 single
 day
 to
 cover


it.
 And
 thank
 you
 all
 for
 supporting
 as


much
 as
 you
 did.
 Either
 way,
 I
 uploaded


my
 first
 deep
 dive
 or
 not
 my
 first
 deep


dive
 that'll
 come
 out
 tomorrow,
 but
 my


first
 uh
 post
 on
 Substack
 and
 it's
 a


very
 simple
 probably
 five
 minute
 read
 on


my
 methodology
 for
 how
 I
 analyze


companies.
 So,
 I'll
 leave
 that
 in
 the


description
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to
 check
 it


out.
 Feel
 free
 to
 check
 it
 out.
 And
 uh


first
 deep
 dives
 will
 be
 launching


tomorrow.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 next


week
 on
 the
 deep
 dives.
