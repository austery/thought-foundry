Bloomberg
 Audio
 Studios,

radio,
 news.


>> Good
 morning.
 I'm
 Nathan
 Hager


>> and
 I'm
 Karen
 Moscow.
 Here
 are
 the


stories
 we're
 following
 today.


>> Karen,
 we
 begin
 with
 the
 latest


developments
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.


Israel's
 government
 has
 approved
 a


ceasefire
 deal
 with
 Hamas
 that
 will


include
 releasing
 thousands
 of


Palestinian
 prisoners
 in
 exchange
 for


any
 remaining
 hostages
 in
 Gaza.
 Stuart


Livingston
 Wallace
 heads
 Bloomberg's


Middle
 East
 coverage.


>> It
 all
 seems
 to
 be
 going
 reasonably


smoothly.
 It
 went
 to
 the
 Israeli
 cabinet


last
 night
 was
 approved.
 So,
 we're
 now


in
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 24-hour
 initial
 phase


where
 the
 IDF,
 that
 is
 the
 Israeli
 army,


will
 start
 withdrawing
 from
 its
 current


positions
 to
 sort
 of
 a
 pre-agreed
 line.


They
 will
 still
 be
 inside
 Gaza,
 but
 it's


going
 to
 be
 over
 a
 significantly
 smaller


amount
 of
 territory.
 So,
 basically,


we're
 looking
 at
 the
 next
 four
 days.


It's
 going
 to
 unfold.
 And
 again,
 this
 is


very
 much
 phase
 one.
 And
 then
 in
 terms


of
 the
 next
 hurdles,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go.
 And
 you
 know,


we
 should
 be
 under
 no
 illusion
 about
 how


difficult
 some
 of
 those
 questions
 are.


Notably
 on
 the
 question
 of
 the,
 you


know,
 the
 complete
 disarmament
 of
 Hamas,


the
 future
 governance
 of
 the
 Gaza
 Strip,


and
 perhaps
 most
 importantly,
 the


reconstruction
 of
 the
 Gaza
 Strip.


Bloomberg
 Stuart
 Livingston
 Wallace
 says


President
 Trump
 will
 travel
 to
 Israel.


He
 says
 to
 be
 on
 hand
 for
 the
 release
 of


the
 hostages.


>> And
 we
 have
 some
 breaking
 news
 here,


Nathan.
 Venezuelan
 opposition
 leader


Maria
 Corina
 Machado
 has
 won
 the
 2025


Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.
 And
 of
 course,
 we'll


be
 watching
 this
 morning
 for
 any


reaction
 from
 President
 Trump,
 who
 has


waged
 an
 aggressive
 lobbying
 campaign


ahead
 of
 today's
 announcement.
 And


again,
 that's
 just
 crossing
 the


Bloomberg.


>> All right,
 Karen,
 thank
 you
 for
 that.


And
 now
 to
 the
 latest
 on
 the
 federal


government
 shutdown
 into
 day
 10
 of
 the


stalemate
 in
 Washington.
 Both
 sides


continue
 to
 blame
 each
 other
 for
 the


impass
 and
 President
 Trump
 is
 doubling


down
 on
 threats
 to
 take
 advantage
 of
 it.


>> We'll
 be
 cutting
 some
 very
 popular


Democrat
 uh
 programs
 that
 aren't
 popular


with
 Republicans
 frankly
 because
 that's


the
 way
 it
 works.
 They
 wanted
 to
 do
 this


so
 we'll
 give
 them
 a
 little
 taste
 of


their
 own
 medicine.
 President
 Trump


spoke
 at
 a
 cabinet
 meeting
 at
 the
 White


House
 heard
 live
 on
 Bloomberg
 radio,
 but


Republicans
 may
 be
 feeling
 political


heat
 as
 well.
 House
 Speaker
 Mike
 Johnson


took
 questions
 about
 the
 shutdown
 on


C-SPAN.
 One
 caller
 on
 the
 Republican


side
 said
 her
 husband
 serves
 at
 Fort


Belvour,
 Virginia,
 and
 their
 medically


sensitive
 children
 might
 have
 to
 go


without
 medication
 if
 they
 miss
 a


paycheck.


>> You
 could
 stop
 this
 and
 you
 could
 be
 the


one
 that
 could
 say
 military's
 getting


paid.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is
 awful.
 And


the
 audacity
 of
 someone
 who
 makes
 six


figures
 a
 year
 to
 do
 this
 to
 military


families
 is
 insane.


>> Speaker
 Johnson
 responded
 to
 that
 caller


saying
 the
 Democrats
 are
 the
 ones


keeping
 her
 from
 getting
 a
 check.


>> Well,
 Nathan,
 the
 Trump
 White
 House
 has


decided
 there's
 a
 group
 of
 federal


staffers
 they
 can't
 do
 without
 during


the
 shutdown,
 and
 the
 people
 who
 put


together
 the
 economic
 data
 are
 the
 ones


they're
 talking
 about.
 Let's
 get
 more


from
 Bloomberg's
 John
 Tucker.
 John,
 good


morning.


>> Yeah,
 good
 morning
 Karen.
 White
 House


Office
 of
 Management
 and
 Budget
 has


directed
 the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor
 Statistics


to
 recall
 staff.
 They
 need
 them
 to


assemble
 the
 September
 consumer
 price


index.
 That
 is
 the
 report
 that


determines
 the
 size
 of
 next
 year's


Social
 Security
 checks.
 Dozens
 of


economists
 and
 IT
 specialists
 are


typically
 involved.
 So,
 it's
 still


unlikely
 this
 report's
 going
 to
 be


released
 by
 its
 original
 publication


date
 of
 October
 15th.
 You'll
 recall


President
 Trump
 fired
 the
 BLS


commissioner
 in
 August
 after
 the
 release


of
 a
 weaker
 thanex
 expected
 jobs
 report


he
 didn't
 like.
 In
 New
 York,
 I'm
 John


Tucker,
 Bloomberg
 Radio.


>> All right,
 John.
 Thank
 you.
 We
 have
 this


red
 headline
 crossing
 the
 Bloomberg


terminal.
 China
 is
 probing
 Qualcomm
 for


suspected
 violations
 of
 the
 country's


anti-
 monopoly
 law.
 That's
 according
 to


a
 statement
 from
 Beijing
 State


Administration
 for
 market
 regulation.


Qualcomm
 shares
 in
 the
 pre-market
 down


three
 and
 a
 quarter%.


Well,
 Nathan,
 the
 Justice
 Department
 is


still
 working
 through
 the
 shutdown,
 and


it's
 bringing
 charges
 against
 another


one
 of
 President
 Trump's
 perceived


political
 enemies.
 New
 York
 Attorney


General
 Leticia
 James
 has
 been
 indicted


on
 counts
 of
 bank
 fraud
 and
 making
 false


statements
 to
 a
 financial
 institution.


The
 grand
 jury
 indictment
 stems
 from
 a


property
 James
 purchased
 in
 Norfol,


Virginia
 in
 2020.
 It's
 the
 second


indictment
 brought
 by
 US
 Attorney


Lindseay
 Halligan,
 who
 was
 recently


appointed
 by
 Trump
 and
 also
 secured


charges
 against
 former
 FBI
 Director


James
 Comey.
 Attorney
 General
 James
 says


she'll
 fight
 the
 charges.
 This
 is


nothing
 more
 than
 a
 continuation
 of
 the


president's
 desperate
 weaponization
 of


our
 justice
 system.
 He
 is
 forcing


federal
 law
 enforcement
 agencies
 to
 do


his
 bidding.
 All
 because
 I
 did
 my
 job
 as


the
 New
 York
 State
 Attorney
 General.


Attorney
 General
 Leticia
 James
 posted


that
 statement
 on
 X.
 She
 campaigned
 on
 a


promise
 to
 investigate
 President
 Trump


and
 won
 a
 civil
 case
 against
 him
 and
 his


company
 in
 2022.
 Her
 first
 appearance
 in


federal
 court
 in
 Virginia
 is
 set
 for


October
 24th.


>> Turning
 overseas
 now,
 Karen,
 French


President
 Emanuel
 Mcron
 is
 expected
 to


pick
 a
 new
 prime
 minister
 by
 this


evening
 after
 the
 resignation
 of


Sebastian
 Lornu
 earlier
 this
 week.


Richard
 Bravo
 leads
 Bloomberg's
 coverage


of
 Western
 European
 government.
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 any
 closer
 to
 knowing


exactly
 who
 he
 will
 pick
 to
 be
 the
 next


prime
 minister,
 but
 the
 important
 thing


to
 focus
 on
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 he's
 naming


a
 prime
 minister
 at
 all.
 Earlier
 this


week,
 it
 was
 increasingly
 looking
 like


Macron
 would
 call
 another
 snap
 election.


That
 would
 have
 meant
 even
 more


political
 chaos
 and
 financial


instability.
 So
 even
 though
 it's
 not


clear
 who
 exactly
 Mcron
 could
 name
 and


the
 list
 is
 very
 long
 and
 and
 it
 does


run
 the
 political
 gamut,
 most
 see
 this


as
 the
 least
 bad
 option.
 Bloomberg's


Richard
 Bravo
 reports
 Francis
 caretaker


finance
 minister
 Roland
 Lassour
 says
 the


country
 is
 on
 course
 to
 meet
 its
 budget


promises
 to
 the
 European
 Union
 even


after
 outgoing
 Premier
 Lornu
 indicated


there
 will
 be
 less
 fiscal
 consolidation


next
 year
 than
 previously
 planned.
 Well,


in
 Asia,
 Nathan,
 Japan's
 decade
 old


ruling
 coalition
 has
 collapsed.
 It
 comes


after
 talks
 between
 Liberal
 Democratic


Party
 chief
 Senate
 Kaishi
 and
 junior


partner
 Kato
 leader
 Tetssuo
 Saitto
 ended


without
 agreement.
 The
 collapse
 was
 due


to
 a
 disagreement
 over
 the
 needs
 for
 the


LDP
 to
 regulate
 political
 donations.
 The


coalition
 has
 maintained
 political


stability
 for
 LDP
 administrations
 for


most
 of
 the
 past
 quarter
 century.
 And


looking
 at
 the
 yen,
 it's
 at
 152.70


against
 the
 dollar.
 Back
 to
 this


country,
 Karen,
 there's
 a
 warning
 from


Ray
 Dallio.
 The
 Bridgewater
 Associates


founder
 says
 US
 government
 debt
 is


rising
 too
 quickly,
 creating
 a
 climate


he
 says
 is
 very
 much
 analogous
 to
 the


years
 before
 World
 War
 II.
 Dalio
 spoke


with
 Bloomberg's
 Francine
 Lqua.


>> We're
 in
 wars.
 Okay,
 there
 is
 a


financial
 money
 war,
 there's
 a


technology
 war,
 there's
 geopolitical


wars,
 and
 there
 are
 more
 military
 wars.


And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 civil
 war
 of
 some
 sort


which
 is
 developing
 in
 the
 United
 States


and
 elsewhere
 where
 there
 are


irreconcilable


differences.


>> Bridgewwater
 founder
 Ray
 Dalio
 has
 long


cautioned
 of
 the
 risks
 of
 spiraling
 US


debt.
 Last
 month
 he
 said
 it
 poses
 a


threat
 to
 the
 monetary
 order.
 And
 Nathan


Paramount
 Sky
 Dance
 chief
 executive


David
 Ellison
 who
 is
 reportedly
 weighing


a
 merger
 with
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery


says
 he
 sees
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 for


consideration
 in
 the
 industry.
 We
 spoke


with
 him
 at
 the
 Bloomberg
 Screen
 Time


Conference
 in
 Los
 Angeles.


>> First
 and
 foremost,
 what's
 good
 for
 the


talent
 community?
 What's
 good
 for
 our


shareholders
 and
 value
 creation?
 And


what's
 good
 for
 basically
 storytelling


at
 large?
 And
 so
 from
 our
 standpoint,


whether
 we
 were
 approach
 any


acquisition,
 and
 I
 actually
 do
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 options
 out
 there
 in


terms
 of
 what
 actually
 might
 be


actionable
 in
 the
 near
 future,
 we
 would


approach
 that
 through
 the
 lens
 of


wanting
 to
 make
 more,
 not
 less.


>> And
 David
 Ellison
 took
 over
 Paramount,


the
 parent
 of
 CBS,
 Nickelodeon,
 MTV,
 and


the
 namesake
 movie
 studio
 in
 August


after
 completing
 an
 8
 billion
 dollar


merger
 with
 his
 film
 production
 company,


Skyance
 Media.
 Get
 that
 full


conversation
 and
 all
 of
 the
 biggest


names
 we
 spoke
 with
 at
 screen
 time
 on


the
 Bloomberg
 podcast
 channel
 on


YouTube.


Time
 now
 for
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 other


stories
 making
 news
 in
 New
 York
 and


around
 the
 world.
 And
 for
 that,
 we're


joined
 by
 Bloomberg's
 Michael
 Bar.


Michael,
 good
 morning.


>> Good
 morning,
 Karen.
 National
 Guard


troops
 are
 expected
 to
 begin
 patrolling


in
 Memphis.
 The
 patrols
 are
 expected


today
 after
 a
 federal
 judge
 in
 Illinois


ruled
 Thursday
 to
 block
 a
 deployment
 in


the
 Chicago
 area
 for
 at
 least
 2
 weeks.


Illinois
 Attorney
 Generalwami
 Ru
 says


the
 deployment
 was
 never
 legally


justifiable.


>> This
 is
 an
 important
 decision
 not
 just


for
 the
 state
 of
 Illinois


uh
 but
 for
 the
 entire
 country.

 Virginia


gubanatorial
 candidates
 Democrat
 Abigail


Spanberger
 and
 Republican
 Winom
 Earl


Sears
 clashed
 over
 issues
 in
 a
 debate
 at


Norfolk
 State
 University.
 The
 debate


also
 focused
 heavily
 on
 a
 text
 message


scandal
 involving
 Democratic
 nominee
 for


attorney
 general
 Jay
 Jones
 with
 Earl


Sears
 pressing
 Spanberger
 to
 demand


Jones
 suspend
 his
 campaign.


>> Really
 what
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 this
 first


question
 is
 Abigail
 when
 are
 you
 going


to
 take
 Jay
 Jones
 and
 say
 to
 him
 you


must
 leave
 the
 race?
 He
 has
 said
 that
 he


wants
 to
 murder
 his
 political
 opponent


and
 not
 only
 that,
 but
 the
 polit
 the
 his


political
 opponent's
 children


and
 5
 years
 old.


>> Earlier,
 Spanberger
 condemned
 Jones's


remarks,
 but
 stopped
 short
 of
 calling


for
 him
 to
 exit
 the
 race.


>> As
 we
 move
 forward,
 the
 voters
 now
 have


this
 information,
 information
 that
 was


withheld
 for
 them,
 presumably
 for


political
 reasons.
 Uh
 but
 the
 voters
 now


have
 the
 information
 and
 it
 is
 up
 to


voters
 uh
 to
 make
 an
 individual
 choice


based
 on
 this
 information.


>> Spanberger,

 representative,

 More
 from
 Bloomberg


Daybreak
 coming
 up
 after
 this.


>> Coast
 to
 coast
 on
 Bloomberg
 radio,


nationwide
 on
 SiriusXM,
 and
 around
 the


world
 on
 Bloomberg.com
 and
 the
 Bloomberg


Business
 App.
 This
 is
 Bloomberg


Daybreak.
 Good
 morning.
 I'm
 Nathan


Hagar.
 It
 is
 a
 major
 step
 toward
 ending


two
 years
 of
 brutal
 war
 in
 Gaza.


Israel's
 government
 has
 approved
 a
 deal


for
 Hamas
 to
 free
 its
 remaining
 hostages


in
 exchange
 for
 more
 than
 2,000


Palestinian
 prisoners.
 Israeli
 Prime


Minister
 Benjamin
 Netanyahu
 says
 this


clears
 the
 way
 for
 those
 hostages
 to


come
 home
 in
 the
 next
 3
 days.


>> We
 couldn't
 have
 achieved
 it
 without
 the


extraordinary
 help
 of
 President
 Trump


and
 his
 team,
 Steve
 Whit,
 and
 Jared


Kushner.
 Israeli
 Prime
 Minister
 Benjamin


Netanyahu
 spoke
 after
 the
 vote
 flanked


by
 the
 White
 House
 special
 envoy
 and


President
 Trump's
 son-in-law.
 For
 the


very
 latest,
 we
 go
 to
 Tel
 Aviv
 and


welcome
 Bloomberg
 News
 Israel
 Bureau


Chief
 Ethan
 Bronner.
 Ethan,
 good


morning.
 This
 morning,
 after
 the
 vote,


is
 the
 ceasefire
 holding?


>> Well,
 the
 ceasefire
 is
 actually
 only


just
 starting
 officially,
 right?
 I
 mean,


it's
 they
 uh
 the
 deal
 was
 that
 after
 the


vote,
 Israel
 would
 begin
 to
 redeploy
 its


forces
 from
 controlling
 approximately
 uh


70%
 of
 Gaza
 to
 about
 half
 of
 it.
 So,


Israel
 has
 begun,
 actually,
 I
 think
 in


just
 the
 last
 minutes,
 to
 start
 to
 move


its
 troops
 back
 to
 that
 uh
 first
 line


agreed
 to
 uh
 between
 the
 two
 sides.


interesting
 to
 see
 uh
 the
 the
 White


House
 envoy
 and
 President
 Trump's


son-in-law
 side
 by
 side
 with
 Netanyahu


as
 he
 was
 surrounded
 by
 his
 cabinet


during
 this
 vote.
 We've
 spoken
 before


about
 US
 influence
 on
 Israel
 throughout


this
 conflict.
 What
 does
 this
 say
 to


have
 them
 in
 the
 room
 at
 this
 moment?


You
 know,
 this
 is
 something
 honestly


that
 was
 done
 even
 during
 the
 Biden


administration.
 and
 President
 Biden,


Tony
 Blinken,
 and
 others
 would
 sit
 in


the
 cabinet
 meeting
 uh
 during
 the


beginning
 of
 this
 war
 in
 a
 sign
 of


solidarity.
 So,
 of
 course,
 it's
 it
 is
 as


you
 as
 you
 point
 out,
 a
 sign
 of
 an


incredible
 sort
 of
 shoulder-to-shoulder,


you
 know,
 no
 daylight,
 we're
 all
 in
 this


together
 approach.
 And
 obviously,
 there


have
 been
 tensions
 between
 Netanyahu
 and


Trump.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 the
 point
 and


again
 in
 addition,
 President
 Trump
 is


planning
 to
 be
 here
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 days.


So
 the
 point
 is
 to
 say
 whatever
 tensions


there
 have
 been,
 we're
 basically


together
 in
 our
 views
 of
 how
 to
 go


forward
 here.


>> Going
 forward,
 there
 are
 still
 plenty
 of


unanswered
 questions
 as
 to
 whether
 this


will
 be
 just
 a
 first
 step
 or
 whether


this
 20point
 plan
 can
 be
 fully


implemented,
 aren't
 there?


>> Yeah.
 Many,
 many,
 many.
 I
 mean
 in
 fact


fundamentally
 what's
 most
 striking
 about


this
 is
 that
 uh
 for
 for
 a
 variety
 of


reasons
 which
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 Hamas
 is


going
 to
 give
 up
 all
 the
 hostages
 in


front
 that
 is
 to
 say
 in
 the
 next
 72


hours
 uh
 and
 then
 uh
 Israel
 uh
 is
 going


to
 free
 about
 1950
 uh
 Palestinian


prisoners
 uh
 and
 then
 we
 shall
 see.
 Then


there's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 that's


supposed
 to
 happen,
 but
 it's
 going
 to


have
 to
 be
 negotiated
 in
 terms
 of
 who's


going
 to
 rule
 the
 Gaza
 Strip
 and
 whether


Hamas
 is
 going
 to
 disarm
 and
 how
 and
 so


on
 and
 so
 forth.
 Lots
 and
 lots
 of
 stuff


ahead
 of
 us
 for
 sure.


>> So
 then
 Ethan,
 what
 are
 we
 expecting


when
 those
 negotiations
 continue?
 I


imagine
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 fraught


conversation
 still
 in
 Charmeal
 Shake.


>> Deeply,
 deeply.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 in
 Charal
 Shikh.
 Um
 I


don't
 know
 where
 these
 negotiations
 are


going
 to
 take
 place
 or
 or
 you
 know
 over


what
 period
 of
 time
 but
 absolutely


hugely
 fraught.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 the


the
 my
 instinct
 is
 that
 the
 reason
 Hamas


is
 giving
 up
 all
 the
 hostages
 up
 front


which
 is
 something
 it
 had
 refused
 to
 do


consistently
 for
 2
 years
 is
 that
 Qatar


and
 Turkey
 and
 Egypt
 its
 sponsors
 and


friends
 have
 said
 to
 it
 do
 that
 and
 then


work
 hard
 on
 the
 question
 of
 your
 role


in
 the
 future
 and
 and
 who
 gets
 amnesty


and
 so
 forth
 and
 so
 on.
 So,
 uh,
 uh,


Israel
 is
 still
 saying
 it's
 not
 going
 to


allow
 Hamas
 to
 have
 any
 role
 in
 the


future
 of
 Gaza
 ruling
 rulership.
 So,
 we


shall
 see.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 a
 lot.
 There's
 no


no
 question
 about
 it.
 But
 the
 I
 mean,


the
 other
 question
 is
 once
 Israel
 gets


its
 hostages
 back,
 will
 it
 a
 will
 Prime


Minister
 Netanyahu
 call
 an
 early


election?
 Reasonably
 likely.
 Will
 he


win?
 Another
 question.
 And
 also,
 will


the
 public
 uh
 say,
 "Look,
 our
 hostages


are
 home.
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 fight


anymore,
 no matter
 what's
 going
 on
 in


Gaza."
 I
 don't
 know.
