the
 global
 economy
 has
 a
 peculiar
 habit


of
 what
 economists
 diplomatically
 call


periodic
 Corrections
 you
 might
 know
 them


better
 as
 those
 moments
 when
 everyone


suddenly
 remembers
 markets
 can
 go
 down


as
 well
 as


up
 2008
 the
 housing
 market
 discovers
 the


law
 of
 gravity


2020
 the
 global
 economy
 learns
 it's
 not


actually
 cloud-based


2023
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 proves
 that


even
 the
 most
 Innovative
 disruption


still
 follows
 the
 base
 Bic
 rules
 of


banking
 behind
 each
 of
 these
 Corrections


stands
 John
 Maynard
 KES
 The
 Economist


who
 dared
 to
 suggest
 that
 perhaps


markets
 aren't
 as
 self-regulating
 as


we'd
 like
 to
 believe
 in
 the
 next
 couple


of
 minutes
 we'll
 explore
 how
 economies


actually
 function
 why
 free
 markets


sometimes
 freeze
 and
 what
 can
 be
 done


about
 it
 whether
 you're
 an
 investor


trying
 to
 understand
 Market
 Cycles
 a


student
 preparing
 for
 exams
 or
 someone


wondering
 why
 economic
 theory
 suddenly


feels
 relevant
 this
 is
 where
 Theory


meets


reality
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 world


before
 canes
 when
 markets
 were
 supposed


to
 fix


themselves
 before
 can's
 economic
 theory


was
 built
 on
 an
 elegantly
 simple
 idea


markets
 naturally
 find
 balance
 like
 a


perfectly
 tuned
 machine
 Supply
 meets


demand
 prices
 adjust
 and
 every
 problem


fixes
 itself
 Adam
 Smith's
 invisible
 hand


would
 guide
 the
 economy
 to
 Optimal


outcomes
 without
 any
 outside


interference


this
 wasn't
 just
 Theory
 it
 seemed
 to


work
 the
 Industrial
 Revolution


transformed
 economies
 markets
 expanded


and
 living
 standards
 Rose
 the
 Invisible


Hand
 was
 conducting
 a


masterpiece
 then
 came


1929
 the
 Great
 Depression
 wasn't
 just
 a


downturn
 it
 was
 a
 mathematical


impossibility
 according
 to
 classical


economics
 with
 unemployment
 reaching
 25%


and
 production
 Falling
 by
 a
 third
 the


Invisible
 Hand
 had
 apparently
 developed


a
 severe
 Tremor
 classical
 economists


kept
 insisting
 the
 market
 would


self-correct
 which
 is
 rather
 like
 saying


a
 car
 without
 brakes
 will
 eventually


stop
 technically
 true
 but
 the


destination
 might
 be
 problematic
 what


kan's
 realized
 watching
 this
 economic


freef
 fall
 was
 that
 the
 economy
 isn't
 a


self-regulating
 machine
 it's
 more
 like
 a


complex
 network
 of
 human
 decisions
 each


influencing
 the
 other
 and
 human


decisions
 as
 we're
 about
 to
 see
 don't


always
 follow
 the
 rational
 path


economists
 expect
 let's
 explore
 what


kan's
 discovered
 about
 what
 really


drives
 economic


activity
 let's
 start
 with
 kan's


fundamental
 Insight
 what
 really
 drives


economies
 isn't
 Supply
 it's
 demand


specifically
 what
 economists
 call


aggregate
 demand
 the
 total
 spending
 in


an
 economy
 think
 of
 the
 last
 recession


you
 lived
 through
 companies
 weren't


struggling
 because
 they
 forgot
 how
 to


make
 things
 the
 problem
 was
 simpler
 and


more
 complex
 at
 the
 same
 time


people
 stopped
 spending
 here's
 how
 it


works
 when
 uncertainty
 Rises
 people
 in


businesses
 naturally
 become
 cautious
 you


postpone
 buying
 a
 new
 car
 companies


delay
 building
 new
 factories
 each


decision
 seems
 perfectly
 rational
 on
 its


own
 after
 all
 who
 doesn't
 want
 to
 be


careful
 during
 uncertain
 times
 but


here's
 the
 Paradox
 kan's
 identified
 your


spending
 is
 someone
 else's
 income
 when


everyone
 tries
 to
 save
 at
 once
 we
 create


the
 very
 downturn
 everyone
 was
 worried


about
 and
 that's
 not
 even
 the
 scary
 part


each
 dollar
 not
 spent
 has
 an
 impact
 far


beyond
 its
 face


value
 the
 multiplier
 effect
 is
 what


turns
 a
 small
 economic
 hiccup
 into
 a


full-blown
 crisis
 or
 on
 the
 bright
 side


what
 can
 turn
 a
 modest
 investment
 into


widespread
 growth
 let's
 say
 a
 company


cancels
 construction
 of
 a
 $10
 million


Factory
 it's
 not
 just
 $10
 million
 that


vanishes
 from
 the
 economy
 the


construction
 workers
 who
 would
 have
 been


hired
 now
 can't
 spend
 at
 local


businesses
 those
 businesses
 then
 order


less
 inventory
 their
 suppliers
 scale


back
 production
 and
 their
 workers
 have


less
 to
 spend
 like
 a
 financial
 game
 of


dominoes
 the
 initial
 $10
 million
 drop


might
 reduce
 total
 economic
 activity
 by


$30
 million
 or
 more
 but
 if
 the
 math
 is


this
 straightforward
 why
 can't
 we


predict
 or
 prevent
 economic
 crises
 turns


out
 economic
 decisions
 aren't
 always


about
 the
 math


here's
 where
 rational
 economic
 theory


meets
 irrational
 human
 behavior
 Kane's


observed
 that
 markets
 aren't
 moved
 by


pure
 mathematics
 they're
 driven
 by
 human


psychology
 or
 what
 he
 called
 animal


spirits
 take
 the
 cryptocurrency
 boom


traditional
 economics
 might
 explain
 why


digital
 currencies
 have
 value
 but
 it


can't
 fully
 account
 for
 why
 Bitcoin
 can


soar
 on
 a
 tweet
 from
 Elon
 Musk
 or
 crash


on
 news
 from
 China
 these
 waves
 of


optimism
 and
 pessimism
 conf
 confidence


and
 fear
 Drive
 investment
 decisions
 far


more
 than
 careful


calculation
 this
 isn't
 just
 about


speculative
 markets
 business
 investment


hiring
 decisions
 and
 even
 government


policies
 are
 all
 influenced
 by
 these


psychological
 factors
 when
 confidence


Falls
 no
 amount
 of
 positive
 data
 can


convince
 investors
 to
 take
 risks
 so
 if


psychology
 can
 override
 economics
 how
 do


we
 prevent
 total


collapse
 if
 markets
 are
 driven
 by


psychology
 as
 much
 as
 mathematics


waiting
 for
 them
 to
 self-correct
 is
 like


expecting
 a
 panicked
 crowd
 to
 calm
 down


on
 its
 own
 sometimes
 you
 need
 someone
 to


step
 in
 and
 restore
 confidence
 this
 is


where
 government
 policy
 enters
 the


picture
 KES
 proposed
 two
 main
 tools


fiscal
 policy
 and
 monetary
 policy
 think


of
 them
 as
 the
 accelerator
 and
 break


pedals
 for
 the
 economy
 fiscal
 policy
 is


when
 the
 government
 directly
 influenc
 es


spending
 during
 a
 downturn
 while


everyone
 else
 is
 cutting
 back
 the


government
 steps
 in
 as
 the
 spender
 of


Last
 Resort
 building
 infrastructure


funding
 research
 or
 even
 sending


stimulus
 checks
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 counter


that
 downward
 spiral
 we
 saw
 with
 the


multiplier
 effect
 take
 the
 2020
 pandemic


response
 when
 businesses
 shut
 down
 and


people
 stay
 at
 home
 government's


worldwide
 rolled
 out
 unprecedented


stimulus


packages
 was
 it
 perfect
 number
 but
 it


helped
 prevent
 the
 co
 recession
 from


becoming
 another
 Great
 Depression


monetary
 policy
 managed
 by
 central
 banks


works
 by
 controlling
 the
 cost
 and


availability
 of
 money
 by
 adjusting


interest
 rates
 and
 money
 supply
 they
 try


to
 influence
 borrowing
 spending
 and


investment
 decisions
 it's
 like
 trying
 to


calibrate
 the
 temperature
 of
 the
 economy


not
 too
 hot
 inflation
 not
 too
 cold


recession
 but
 these
 tools
 come
 with


their
 own


challenges
 after
 all
 if
 fixing
 the


economy
 was
 as
 simple
 as
 pressing
 a


button


modern
 economic
 crises
 have
 become
 a


stress
 test
 for
 Keynesian
 Theory
 during


the
 2008
 financial
 crisis
 governments


faced
 a
 classic
 Keynesian
 moment
 private


spending
 collapsed
 confidence
 evaporated


and
 markets
 spiraled
 downward
 the


response
 massive
 stimulus
 packages
 near


zero
 interest
 rates
 and
 direct
 Market


intervention
 did
 it
 work
 well
 we
 avoided


another
 great
 depression
 but
 the


recovery
 revealed
 new
 challenges
 Kane's


never
 had
 to
 consider
 in
 our
 globalized


economy
 stimulus
 spending
 often
 leaks


overseas
 zero
 interest
 rates
 can
 create


asset
 Bubbles
 and
 government
 debt
 well


that's
 become
 a
 debate
 all
 its
 own
 the


2020
 pandemic
 added
 another
 wrinkle
 when


policy
 makers
 deployed
 the
 Keynesian


Playbook
 at
 unprecedented
 speed
 and


scale
 we
 got
 to
 see
 its
 limitations
 in


real
 time
 stimulus
 checks
 revealed
 the


challenge
 of
 targeting
 some
 who
 needed


help
 didn't
 get
 enough
 While
 others
 got


more
 than
 they
 needed
 near
 zero
 interest


rates
 worked
 until
 inflation
 forced
 a


dramatic
 reversal
 even
 the
 multiplier


effect
 proved
 more
 complex
 in
 a
 supply


constrained
 economy
 yet
 despite
 these


challenges
 Keynesian
 insights
 remain


fundamental
 to
 understanding
 Market


behavior
 and
 crafting
 crisis
 responses


so
 what's
 the
 verdict
 on
 Keynesian


economics
 like
 markets
 themselves
 it's


complicated
 Keynesian
 economics
 isn't


perfect
 no
 economic
 theory
 is
 but
 it


gives
 us
 something
 invaluable
 a


framework
 for
 understanding
 why
 markets


break
 down
 and
 tools
 for
 preventing


economic
 collapse
 modern
 economies
 face


challenges
 can's
 never
 imagined
 instant


Global
 Capital
 flows
 digital
 currencies


automated
 trading
 yet
 his
 core
 Insight


remains
 relevant
 markets
 aren't


self-correcting
 machines
 they're


networks
 of
 human
 decisions
 and


sometimes
 humans
 need
 a
 little
 help


making
 better
 ones
 whether
 you're
 facing


an
 exam
 managing
 Investments
 or
 trying


to
 make
 sense
 of
 economic
 headlines


understanding
 these
 principles
 matters


more
 than
 ever
