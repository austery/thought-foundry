Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


head
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 so
 we
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 in
 really
 good
 company
 with


Ken
 Rogoff.
 Now
 Ken
 is
 known
 for
 his


insights
 into
 global
 finance,
 economic


history
 and
 for
 his
 incredible
 book


which
 he
 wrote
 together
 with
 Carmen


Reyhard
 which
 is
 like
 a
 seminal
 book


actually
 and
 it's
 called
 this
 time
 it's


different.
 He's
 out
 with
 a
 new
 book


coming
 up
 soon.
 Uh
 and
 you
 can
 look


forward
 to
 it.
 Ken,
 wonderful
 to
 have


you
 here.
 Uh
 wonderful
 to
 be
 here.
 Thank


you
 for
 having
 me
 on
 your
 podcast.
 So,


um,
 Ken,
 I
 think
 I've
 said
 once
 that


discussing,
 you
 know,
 inflation
 with


you,
 that's
 a
 bit
 like
 discussing,
 uh,


the
 Bible
 with,
 uh,
 with with
 Jesus.


But,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 let's
 give
 it
 a
 go,


huh?


I
 don't
 know
 how
 we
 can
 live
 up
 to
 that.


Ken,
 um,
 how
 would
 you
 assess
 the


current
 state
 of
 the
 global
 economy
 just


now?
 Well,
 it
 was
 uh
 in
 modestly
 good


shape,
 but
 obviously
 it's
 being
 thrown


into
 chaos
 with
 uh
 the
 restructuring
 of


globalization
 that
 Donald
 Trump
 comes


with
 uh
 what's
 happening
 in
 Europe.
 Uh


you
 know,
 it
 it's
 a
 pretty
 wild
 time.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 it'd
 be
 a
 little
 bit


much
 say
 it's
 unlike
 anything
 we've
 seen


before.
 I
 think
 it
 feels
 a
 little
 like


the
 70s
 to
 me.
 Trump
 actually
 feels
 a


little
 like
 Nixon
 to
 me,
 but
 u
 obviously


we're
 in
 for
 a
 wild
 ride.
 Where
 are
 we


in
 terms
 of
 American
 exceptionalism
 now?


Well,
 it's
 been
 dented.
 I
 mean,
 I'd


almost
 we
 sometimes
 call
 the
 US
 the


hegeimon,
 the
 one
 that
 dominates


everything.
 And
 it's
 almost
 like
 the


hegeimon
 is
 turning
 on
 itself.
 And
 Trump


says,
 and
 I
 hope
 he
 has
 a
 plan,
 that


it's
 all
 going
 to
 be
 better
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 this,
 but
 uh
 obviously
 the
 stock


markets
 are
 getting
 nervous.
 Uh


everybody's
 getting
 nervous
 that
 there


might
 not
 be
 a
 plan.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


mean,
 I
 say
 I
 I
 he's
 the
 president
 of


the
 United
 States.
 I
 wish
 his
 policies


well,
 but
 uh
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to


understand
 exactly
 where
 he's
 going
 and


what
 he's
 doing.
 Again,
 it
 feels
 like
 a


throwback
 to
 the
 70s
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways.


What
 are
 your
 biggest
 concern
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 current
 economic
 policy?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 the
 biggest


concern
 is
 that
 uh
 we
 undermine
 the


institutions
 that
 are
 the
 bedrock
 of
 US


exceptionalism.
 You
 trust
 the
 rule
 of


law.
 Uh
 when
 the
 United
 States
 gives
 its


word,
 it
 keeps
 its
 word.
 I'm
 not
 saying


we
 always
 did
 that,
 but
 you
 know,
 uh


certainly
 with
 respect
 to
 paying
 our


debts,
 uh
 I'm
 concerned
 uh
 certainly


about
 this
 view
 that
 people
 uh
 who


believe
 in
 global
 trade
 and
 global


integration
 are
 globalists.
 I'm
 an


unapologetic
 globalist
 myself.
 uh
 and
 uh


this
 fracturing
 of
 the
 global
 economy.
 I


mean,
 Trump
 sometimes
 and
 his
 people


sometimes
 say,
 "Let's
 go
 back
 to
 the


50s."
 Well,
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 lower
 income


back
 in
 the
 50s.
 Like,
 okay,
 maybe
 we'll


have
 more
 manufacturing
 jobs,
 maybe,
 but


things
 will
 cost
 a
 lot
 more.
 I
 mean,


it's
 it's
 just
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 know
 how


much
 of
 its
 bluster


theater.
 He'll
 retreat.
 Obviously,
 early


on
 that's
 what
 everyone
 thought
 that
 he


was
 just
 saying
 this
 for
 his
 base
 and
 he


would
 pull
 back,
 but
 uh
 you
 know
 that's


uh
 um
 certainly
 not
 how
 it's
 been
 going.


Where
 do
 you
 see
 tariffs
 a
 year
 from


now?
 Whoa.
 You
 threw
 in
 the
 year
 from


now.
 I
 mean,
 it
 seems
 like
 he's
 spinning


a
 wheel
 when
 he
 when
 he
 wakes
 up
 every


morning.
 And
 first
 he
 spins
 the
 wheel
 to


see
 what
 country
 it
 points
 at,
 and
 then


he
 spins
 the
 wheel
 to
 see
 what
 tariff
 he


wants
 to
 put
 on,
 and
 then
 he
 changes
 his


mind
 the
 next
 day.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 that's


a
 really
 hard
 thing
 to
 forecast,
 but
 I
 I


I
 think
 he's
 very
 intent
 on
 it.
 So
 I'm


guessing
 the
 US
 will
 have
 tariffs
 for


example
 on
 Europe
 uh
 on
 on
 the
 uh
 on
 the


order
 of
 uh
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 at least
 10


you
 know
 15%
 20%.
 And
 Europe
 will
 have


retaliated
 and
 there'll
 have
 been
 a
 lot


of
 noise
 back
 and
 forth.
 He
 he
 he
 seems


to
 be
 a
 believer.
 I
 even
 back
 in


2016
 when
 he
 was
 first
 running
 someone


who
 was
 uh
 close
 to
 him
 called
 me
 and


just
 for
 did
 I
 have
 any
 general
 thoughts


and
 I
 said
 okay
 first
 of
 all
 this


conversation
 never
 happened
 I'm
 I I


can't
 be
 seen
 as
 talking
 to
 you
 but
 if


you
 ask
 me
 I
 discussed
 some
 things
 but


the
 tariffs
 are
 a
 terrible
 idea
 why
 are


you
 doing
 the
 tariffs
 this
 is
 this
 is


and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 person
 said
 Well,


you
 know,
 the
 candidate,
 uh,
 Trump,
 uh,


he
 knows
 politics
 better
 than
 I
 do,
 and


he
 thinks
 80%
 of
 Americans
 love


terrorists.
 And
 actually,
 you
 know,
 I,


sadly,
 I
 find
 that
 hard
 to
 argue
 with.


Um,
 my
 mother
 was
 a
 librarian,
 a


brilliant
 woman.
 Uh,
 uh,
 she
 sadly


passed
 away
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 but
 she


liked
 tariffs.
 And
 I
 would
 I'm
 an


economist
 and
 she
 kind
 of
 knew
 I
 had
 a


PhD
 in
 economist
 and
 I
 worked
 on


international
 economics
 and
 I
 would
 say


yeah
 but
 you
 know
 it
 would
 make


everything
 more
 expensive
 and
 do
 we


really
 want
 to
 do
 this
 and
 I
 went
 into


the
 whole
 rigomearroll
 about
 how
 we
 buy


stuff
 from
 them
 and
 they'd
 buy
 stuff


from
 us
 us
 and
 she
 just
 wouldn't
 give
 in


you
 know
 she
 did
 not
 agree
 and
 I
 mean


that's
 a
 you
 know
 very
 educated
 woman


and
 so
 it's
 very
 popular
 and


historically
 This
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the


issues
 where
 the
 president
 who
 knows


that
 people
 don't
 like
 tariffs,
 people


like
 tariffs,
 stands
 and
 says,
 "Well,


you
 know,
 this
 you
 you
 don't
 like
 you


don't
 want
 to
 have
 to
 eat
 your
 your


vegetables,
 but
 eat
 them
 and
 you'll
 grow


and
 it'll
 be
 better."
 And
 uh
 Trump


didn't
 invent
 this,
 by
 the
 way.
 Bernie


Sanders,
 who
 was
 came
 very
 close
 to


being
 the
 candidate
 in
 2016,
 is
 very


influential
 in
 the
 Democratic
 party.
 He


had
 pretty
 much
 the
 same
 stuff.
 he


wouldn't
 agree
 now,
 but
 there's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 open
 water
 between
 really
 the


left
 where
 the
 left
 was
 in
 the
 US
 and


Trump.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 been
 one
 of


those
 things
 which,
 you
 know,
 uh
 it's


it's
 been
 obviously
 very
 good.


Globalization's
 been
 great
 for
 the


United
 States.
 Who
 are
 we
 kidding?
 I


mean,
 the
 United
 States
 has
 been
 at
 the


top.
 has
 benefited
 and
 yes,
 there
 are


problems
 with


globalization,
 but
 uh
 he
 he
 seems
 to


just
 think
 it's
 really
 good
 for
 him.


We'll
 we'll
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.
 How


bad
 are
 Tar
 for
 globalization?
 So,
 truth


be
 told,
 if
 we
 just
 slapped
 on
 20%


tariffs,
 it
 would
 be
 very
 bad,
 like
 a


big
 tax
 hike.
 It
 would
 reduce
 trade.
 it


would
 interfere
 with
 the
 global
 supply


chains
 and
 such.
 It
 would
 not
 be
 the
 end


of
 the
 world
 if
 together
 with
 that
 Trump


did
 a
 bunch
 of
 sensible
 things


deregulation


uh
 you
 know
 finding
 uh
 ways
 to
 uh


improve
 innovation.
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 if


he
 did
 on
 balance
 it
 could
 be
 okay.
 They


do
 raise
 revenue.
 What
 what's
 just
 been


so
 weird
 about
 it
 is
 the
 randomness
 of


it.
 Just
 you
 don't
 know
 what's
 coming.


It's
 like
 he
 wants
 everyone
 to
 hide
 from


him.
 I
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 look
 at
 country
 I
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 ever
 visited
 the
 North


Pole,
 but
 the
 the
 uh
 uh
 penguins
 are


sort
 of
 getting
 eaten
 by
 the
 polar
 bear


and
 they're
 very
 sad
 about
 that,
 but


they
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 in
 and
 fight
 the


polar
 bear.
 They
 sort
 of
 hold
 back
 and


that's
 how
 everyone
 is.
 they
 want.
 Oh,


go
 look
 at
 the
 other
 country.


And
 anyway,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 the
 real
 problem


is
 the
 randomness
 and
 what
 it
 signals


about
 other
 things
 to
 come
 such
 as


central
 bank
 independence.
 We'll
 come


back
 to
 that.
 Just
 um
 what
 will
 be
 the


impact
 on
 inflation
 from
 the
 tariffs?
 So


that
 is
 not
 a
 big
 deal.
 I
 mean
 uh
 it


raises
 prices.
 is
 the
 United
 States
 is


pretty
 closed
 and
 it
 raises
 prices


there'll
 be
 a
 short-term
 effect
 that's
 I


mean
 it
 won't
 be
 pleasant
 and
 I
 think


some
 of
 it
 will
 be
 inflation
 some
 of
 it


lower
 quality
 but
 the
 the
 problem
 is


more
 uh


innovation
 slowing
 growth
 over
 the


longer
 run
 and
 uh
 the
 effect
 on
 American


consumers
 well
 you
 know
 of
 course
 we
 pay


the
 tariffs
 dollar
 for


Every
 study
 shows
 that.
 It
 shows
 it
 on


other
 examples.
 It
 shows
 it
 when
 he
 put


in
 tariffs
 in


2018.
 And
 uh
 so
 you
 know
 this
 whole


story,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 obviously
 like


Mexico
 will
 pay
 for
 the


wall.
 The
 American
 consumers
 will
 pay


the
 tariffs
 both
 in
 terms
 of
 higher


prices
 and
 I
 think
 lower
 quality.
 their


goods
 that
 if
 they
 revert
 to
 the
 United


States
 will
 will
 be
 lower
 quality
 than


we
 get
 at
 the
 moment
 at
 least
 for
 a
 long


time
 to
 come.
 Uh
 you
 are
 a
 professional


uh
 chess
 player
 and
 you're
 still
 uh
 avid


in
 terms
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 playing.
 So
 how


would
 you
 so
 let's
 say
 now
 you're
 in


Europe.
 How
 would
 you
 navigate
 the
 trade


negotiations
 in
 the
 US
 from
 like
 a
 chess


player
 point
 of
 view?
 F
 first
 of
 all
 I'm


still
 a
 grandmaster
 but
 I
 actually


haven't
 played
 in
 decades.
 I
 follow
 uh


follow
 at
 a
 distance.
 I
 think
 you
 have


to
 combine,
 you
 know,
 long-term


strategy.
 What
 is
 it
 we
 want
 to
 do?
 Some


of
 the
 things
 Trump
 is
 forcing
 Europe
 to


do,
 it
 probably
 should
 have
 done
 a
 long


time
 ago.
 I
 think
 I've
 I've
 said


whenever
 I've
 given
 talks
 in
 Europe
 uh


over
 the
 years
 or
 at least
 often
 we
 need


Europe
 to
 be
 a
 geopolitical


counterweight
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 You


can't
 every
 time
 there's
 a
 presidential


election
 and
 you
 know
 you
 think
 people


think
 you
 know
 this
 is
 the
 worst
 thing


that'll
 ever
 happen.
 I
 don't
 know
 what's


to
 come.
 Every
 time
 there's
 a


presidential
 election
 you
 can't
 suddenly


rethink
 everything.
 you
 need
 a


counterbalance
 and
 Europe
 uh
 for


whatever
 its
 frictions
 and
 divisions


probably
 is
 more
 more
 stable.
 You
 don't


have
 one
 election
 in
 France
 or
 Germany


suddenly
 changing
 everything.
 Change
 a


lot
 but
 not
 everything.
 So
 that's
 good.


Uh
 on
 the
 other
 and
 you
 you


uh
 you
 need
 to
 think
 about
 um
 being
 more


independent
 in
 tech.
 that
 Mario
 Draghi,


the
 former
 head
 of
 the
 ECB,
 wrote
 a


report
 where
 he
 made
 that
 point
 where


Europe's
 lagged.
 And
 those
 two
 things


are
 connected
 because
 military
 often


provides
 the
 funding
 early
 on
 for
 uh


tech
 uh
 tech
 startups,
 tech
 investment


and
 uh
 I
 mean
 then
 there's
 short-term


tactics
 which
 obviously
 really
 hard
 to


know.
 I
 mean,
 do
 you
 supplicate
 to
 Trump


and
 kiss
 the
 ring
 or
 which
 your
 public


hates,
 but
 then
 he's
 not
 throwing
 a
 200%


tariff
 on
 you,
 or
 do
 you
 just
 sort
 of


turn
 the
 other
 cheek
 and
 hope
 that
 it


calms
 down?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 it
 it's


not
 it's
 not
 good
 in
 a
 way,
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 it
 kind
 of
 forces
 Europe
 to


g
 be
 more
 assertive,
 to
 be
 more


independent
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 think
 has


been
 a
 long
 time
 coming.
 Will
 we
 have
 a


recession
 in
 the
 US?
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


odds
 have
 gone
 up
 sharply.
 And
 it's
 sort


of
 funny,
 but
 the
 nature
 of
 the


recession
 we
 might
 get
 is
 a
 loss
 of


confidence,
 not
 an
 oil
 shock,
 not
 a


pandemic,
 not
 a
 global
 financial
 crisis.


But
 among
 consumers,
 particularly


consumers
 who
 didn't
 vote
 for
 Trump,


which
 is
 about
 half
 of
 people,
 they


think
 it's
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world.
 They


think
 it's


20089,
 the
 global
 financial
 crisis,
 the


pandemic.
 The
 indicators
 for
 the


Democratic
 voters
 are
 just
 off
 the


charts
 terrible.
 Oddly
 enough,
 they
 also


think
 inflation's
 going
 to
 go
 through


the
 roof.
 You
 talk
 to
 the
 Republicans,


everything's
 ducky.
 They
 economy
 is


doing
 fine.
 There's
 nothing
 to
 worry


about.
 President's
 doing
 a
 great
 job.


Inflation's
 going
 to
 be
 low.
 I
 mean,


they're
 looking
 at
 the
 same
 data
 and


just
 drawing
 completely
 different


conclusions.
 Now,
 half
 of
 all
 the


consumers
 are
 Democrats.
 Have
 you
 seen


this
 before
 that
 um
 political
 uh


inclination
 uh
 impacts
 the
 way
 you
 look


at
 data
 this
 way?
 I've
 never
 se
 I've
 ne


of
 course
 we
 see
 it
 but
 uh
 we
 saw
 it


under
 Biden
 where
 the
 Republicans


thought
 inflation
 was
 way
 higher
 than
 it


was
 and
 the
 Democrats
 thought
 inflation


was
 way
 lower
 than
 it
 was.
 I
 mean
 just


ask
 what's
 inflation
 and
 the
 Republicans


just
 give
 a
 different
 answer.


But
 it
 is
 much
 more
 pronounced
 and
 it


can
 cause
 a
 recession
 because
 yeah
 you


the
 the
 Republicans
 are
 not
 going
 to


spend
 enough
 to
 make
 up
 for
 what
 the


Democrats
 aren't
 spending.
 I
 get
 so
 many


letters
 and
 emails
 from
 relatives,


friends,
 even
 professional
 colleagues.


Should
 I
 sell
 everything?
 You
 know,
 is


the
 world
 ending?
 Should
 they
 should


they
 sell
 everything?
 Well,
 we
 ask
 you


Nikolai
 on
 that.
 But
 no,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 my


uh
 I
 I
 say
 to
 be
 calm
 and
 uh
 I
 it's
 very


hard
 for
 me
 to
 stay
 calm,
 but
 it's
 I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 to
 second
 guessess
 all
 of


this.
 What
 um
 what's
 your
 view
 on
 on


potential
 tariffs
 on
 capital
 inflows?


Well,
 they'd
 been
 very
 strong
 before.


So,
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 bring
 uh
 more


production
 into
 the
 United
 States.
 Uh


but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 something


that's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 a
 first
 order


effect.
 When
 Biden
 put


his
 kind
 of
 called
 it
 inflation


reduction
 act
 but
 his
 environment
 act


that
 had
 a
 ton
 of
 subsidies
 to
 invest
 in


the
 United
 States
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


Europeans
 were
 really
 angry
 about
 that


saying
 you
 know
 this
 is
 just
 basic
 trade


war.
 You're
 incentivizing
 people
 to


invest
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 this


violates
 general
 principle.
 So
 Trump


didn't
 invent
 this.
 Um
 I
 mean
 the


tariffs
 are
 different
 than
 the


subsidies.
 We
 were
 giving
 subsidies
 to


invest
 in
 the
 US
 but
 it's
 six
 of
 one
 and


half
 a
 dozen
 of
 the
 other.
 Uh
 you
 know


it's
 I
 think
 economists
 would
 say
 it's


not
 a
 very
 good
 way
 to
 run
 your


business.
 uh
 it's
 better
 to
 have
 an


environment
 where
 the
 regulation
 and
 the


general
 uh
 work
 environment
 for


companies
 is
 good
 and
 makes
 them
 want
 to


invest.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 won't
 ask
 you
 to


comment
 but
 people
 were
 pouring
 their


money
 into
 the
 US.
 The
 US
 as
 you
 well


know
 had
 been
 outperforming
 the
 last
 10


years
 some
 remarkable
 data
 about
 that.


So
 exactly
 how
 you're
 improving
 things


now
 I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 you
 believe
 there


is
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 a
 Trump
 put?


Where
 is
 he
 going
 to
 put
 it?
 I
 mean,
 uh,


but
 he
 will
 he'll
 he'll
 he'll
 he'll
 pull


back
 is
 what
 you're
 saying.
 So,
 you


don't
 have
 to
 sell
 because
 he's
 sounding


uh
 uh
 untethered,
 but
 it's
 all
 going
 to


pull
 back
 at
 the
 at
 the
 at
 the
 same


time.
 He
 clearly
 looks
 at
 the
 market,


but
 this
 is
 someone
 who's
 very


determined
 to
 put
 his
 place
 in
 history.


He
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it
 came
 from
 his


childhood
 or
 something,
 but
 he
 has
 this


deep
 belief
 that
 tariffs
 are
 beautiful.


He
 says
 it
 again
 and
 again.
 It
 seemed
 to


have
 worked
 very
 well
 for
 him


politically.
 He
 in
 his
 first
 term
 when


he
 said
 something,
 he
 delivered
 it.
 And


so
 I
 I
 don't
 you
 know
 that
 that
 was


certainly
 the
 the
 thinking
 that
 the


markets
 had
 was
 that
 he
 would
 pull
 back.


Now
 I
 want
 to
 emphasize
 the
 real


concerns
 the
 randomness
 of
 it
 if
 if
 he


just
 put
 in
 tariffs
 which
 we
 did
 think


he
 was
 going
 to


do
 and
 you
 know
 10%
 20%
 it
 it
 would
 not


have
 been
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world.
 Bad
 idea


but
 not
 crippling
 you
 it
 would
 hurt


growth
 in
 the
 long
 run.
 it
 would
 hurt
 US


welfare,
 but
 you
 know,
 nothing
 to
 uh


nothing
 compared
 to
 some
 of
 the
 bigger


things
 that
 go
 on.
 So,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 a
 Trump
 put
 put.
 Uh
 I
 think


he
 has
 conviction.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 you


never
 know
 from
 day
 to
 day,
 like


tomorrow,
 maybe
 he'll
 pull
 the
 tariffs


off,
 but
 in
 a
 year
 I'll
 have
 a
 tantrum


at
 someone
 and
 they'll
 be
 back.
 Yeah.


Let's
 move
 on
 to
 the
 dollar.


um
 what's
 so
 what's
 your
 view
 now
 on
 on


the
 US
 dollar's
 global
 role?
 So
 I
 think


uh
 and
 my
 book
 argues
 that
 we
 sort
 of


reached
 the
 peak
 10
 years
 ago
 in
 terms


of
 the
 dollar's
 footprint
 and
 dominance


in
 the
 global
 economy
 and
 lots
 of


different
 measures
 uh
 you
 know
 how
 many


res
 reserves
 people
 hold
 uh
 number
 of


transactions
 in
 dollars
 what's
 priced
 in


dollars
 and
 we
 won't
 need
 to
 go
 into


detail.
 they
 all
 kind
 of
 tell
 the
 same


story
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 this
 what
 I


sort
 of
 portray
 there
 is
 there's
 this


sense
 in
 which
 the
 dollar
 has
 been
 lucky


at
 different
 stages
 the
 US
 has
 been
 good


the
 US
 system's
 good
 but
 as
 the
 US
 has


faced
 challenggers
 I
 think
 they've


fallen
 short
 more
 than
 I
 would
 have


guessed
 and
 it
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 we'd
 have


the
 euro
 instead
 of
 the
 dollar
 but
 it
 is


a
 surprise
 that
 the
 euro
 right
 now
 is
 a


regional
 currency
 It's
 just
 basically


not
 a
 central
 currency
 outside
 of


Europe.
 And
 of
 course,
 the
 yen's
 hardly


used
 at
 all.
 The
 renimi
 even
 less.
 And


I'm
 old
 enough,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 are,


but
 I'm
 old
 enough
 to
 remember
 when


Russia
 was
 considered
 much
 more


seriously
 as
 an
 economic
 counterweight.


And
 we've
 been
 been
 lucky.
 I
 I
 actually


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 book
 quote
 the


Danish
 Grandmaster
 Ben
 Larson
 uh
 and
 he


was
 asked
 would
 you
 rather
 be
 lucky
 or


good
 and
 he
 said
 I'd
 rather
 be
 lucky
 and


good
 and
 I
 think
 Americans
 forget
 the


lucky
 part
 we
 just
 beat
 ourselves
 on
 the


chest
 we're
 the
 greatest
 country
 in
 the


world
 everybody
 loves
 us
 so
 I
 think


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 trends
 pushing


towards
 the
 dollar
 still
 being
 at
 the


top
 but
 not
 quite
 as
 much
 king
 of
 the


Well,
 as
 we
 as
 we
 were,
 is
 there
 a


scenario
 where
 the
 dollar
 uh
 loses
 its


status
 as
 the
 world
 reserve
 currency
 in


a
 bit
 more
 dramatic
 fashion?
 What
 what


could
 what
 could
 cause
 that?
 It
 would
 be


great
 for
 the
 sales
 of
 my
 book
 with


Carmen
 Reinhardt
 that
 you
 mentioned
 at


the
 beginning
 to
 have
 a
 crisis
 of
 that


magnitude.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 the
 the


global
 currency


normally
 changes
 slowly.
 you
 you
 know


you
 had
 the
 Spanish
 peda
 and
 it's
 like


100
 years
 yeah
 like
 a
 hundred
 years
 and


there's
 usually
 you
 know
 you
 die
 a
 slow


death
 over
 time
 and
 the
 newcomer
 comes


up
 and
 you're
 even
 for
 a
 while
 and
 I
 I


would
 describe
 the
 dollar
 as
 late


middleaged
 at
 the
 moment
 uh
 you
 know


there's
 no
 nobody's
 going
 to
 take
 over


right
 now
 but
 for
 it
 to
 actually


disappear
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 seen
 it
 but


there's
 actually
 a
 movie
 uh
 last
 year


something
 like
 called
 uh
 civil
 war
 where


it's
 a
 dystopian
 not
 so
 distant
 future


where
 the
 dollars
 become
 worthless
 and


everybody
 uses
 the
 Canadian
 dollar


instead.
 I
 don't
 know
 you
 know
 but
 no
 I


don't
 see
 it
 happen
 dramatic
 happening


dramatically.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 assess
 other


nations
 efforts
 to
 decouple
 from
 the


dollar
 then?
 Well,
 there's
 the
 uh
 PMIC


stuff
 like
 when
 Lula
 says
 he
 doesn't


want
 to
 use
 the
 dollar
 in
 Brazil
 and
 he


he
 has
 no
 power.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 not
 able


to
 do
 anything.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 Chinese


take
 it
 very
 seriously
 of
 wanting
 it's


it's
 not
 that
 they
 want
 to
 get
 everyone


for
 everything
 to
 use
 the
 renimi
 their


Chinese
 currency
 instead.
 It's
 that
 they


want
 to
 expand
 its
 footprint.
 more


things
 priced
 in
 Chinese
 currency,
 more


loans
 priced
 in
 Chinese
 currency.
 And


they've
 got
 a
 couple
 reasons
 for
 this.
 F


first
 of
 all,
 they
 should
 have
 done
 that


20
 years
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 I


I
 haven't
 had
 engagement
 with
 them
 for


over
 20
 years
 and
 have
 been
 puzzled.


They
 haven't
 done
 that.
 If
 you're
 the


euro
 is
 not
 pegged
 to
 the
 dollar.


There's
 a
 good
 reason
 the
 euro
 is
 not


pegged
 to
 the
 dollar.
 Yet
 forever
 they


had
 their
 rendity,
 this
 big
 economy
 with


its
 own
 business
 cycles,
 its
 own


problems.
 Over
 time,
 it
 has
 become
 a


little
 looser.
 But
 I
 think
 what's
 really


scared
 the
 daylights
 out
 of
 them
 is


watching
 what
 the
 US
 has
 tried
 to
 do
 to


Russia
 with
 the
 sanctions.
 And
 you
 know,


we
 don't
 know,
 but
 China
 is
 certainly


thinking
 about
 uh,
 you
 know,
 provoking


the
 eye
 of
 the
 United
 States
 at
 some


point
 by
 trying
 to
 take
 over


Taiwan
 and
 looking
 at
 the
 sanctions.
 And


it
 it
 isn't
 just,
 you
 know,
 it
 isn't


just
 the
 sanctions,
 it's
 the
 ability
 of


the
 United
 States
 to
 see
 everything.


thing
 and
 I
 a
 thing
 many
 people
 don't


understand
 about
 the
 military
 and
 power


and
 dominance
 of
 the
 United
 States
 is


the
 US
 gets
 to
 make
 the
 rules
 of
 the


game
 when
 bankers
 are
 negotiating
 over


you
 know
 what
 kind
 of
 uh
 transactions


mechanism
 should
 we
 have
 how
 swift
 is


something
 people
 may
 have
 heard
 of
 the


uh
 international
 uh
 messaging
 system


that's
 used
 by
 banks
 all
 of
 these


negotiations


the
 US,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 like
 they
 say


it's
 our
 bomb
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 home


if
 you
 don't
 do
 what
 we
 want,
 but
 they


can.
 And
 it
 gives
 them
 this
 tremendous


power
 and
 so
 many
 things
 go
 through
 the


United
 States.
 We
 Donald
 Trump
 can


possibly
 see
 some
 things
 you
 bought
 uh


because
 the
 clearing
 goes
 through
 the


United
 States.
 If
 it
 touches
 the
 dollar,


most
 of
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 So


by
 getting
 more
 things
 into
 rembi


getting
 more
 things
 into
 the
 Chinese


currency
 and
 developing
 their
 own
 the


word
 is
 rails
 but
 their
 own
 clearing


mechanisms
 they
 can
 get
 around
 this


that's
 as
 big
 as
 all
 the
 other
 things


that
 the
 Chinese
 are
 looking
 at
 when


they're
 trying
 to
 diversify.


So
 uh
 official
 Chinese
 GDP
 growth
 is


around
 5%.
 Some
 people
 think
 it's
 it's


lower
 and
 you
 are
 quite
 skeptical
 when


it
 comes
 to
 the
 official
 figure
 as
 well,


right?
 Yeah,
 absolutely.
 They're


throwing
 people
 in
 in
 jail
 for


questioning
 the
 figure.
 They're


academics
 who
 said
 in
 uh
 too
 publicly


that
 they
 thought
 the
 growth
 was


overstated
 and
 they
 got
 in
 trouble.
 What


are
 the
 global
 implications
 of
 a
 Chinese


economic
 slowdown?
 Well,
 um
 it's
 very


big
 on
 uh
 energy
 exporters
 and
 commodity


exporters.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 if
 we
 were
 to


turn
 around
 and
 tell
 you
 that
 China's


growth's
 going
 to
 be
 8%
 the
 next
 2
 or
 3


years
 instead
 of
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


be
 2
 or
 3%.
 Uh
 probably
 that
 would
 be


very
 good
 for
 inflows
 into
 the
 Norwegian


sovereign
 wealth
 fund.
 I
 mean
 and
 for


Norway
 in
 general
 uh
 and
 for
 the
 United


States
 as
 a
 big
 uh
 energy
 producer
 and


good
 for
 Brazil
 and
 good
 for
 Argentina.


So
 that's
 one
 aspect.
 Another
 aspect
 is


the
 fact
 that
 they're
 in
 trouble
 has
 uh


panicked
 their
 savers.
 We
 were
 talking


about
 the
 Democrats
 in
 the
 United


States.
 People
 in
 China
 are
 they
 have
 no


confidence
 in
 the
 regime.
 They
 have
 they


have
 just
 lost
 confidence.
 So
 they're


trying
 to
 get
 people
 to
 consume,
 but


it's
 just
 collapsed.
 So
 they're
 forced


to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 artificial
 stuff
 to


create
 the
 mirage
 of
 this
 figure
 of
 5%.


And
 uh
 that
 that
 loss
 of
 confidence
 has


pushed
 interest
 rates
 down.
 They're


going
 up
 all
 over
 the
 world.
 Uh
 we
 can


come
 to
 that.
 But
 in
 China,
 they've
 been


going
 down.
 They
 actually
 have


deflation.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 your


prices
 are
 going
 down
 continually
 and


you're
 telling
 me
 you
 have
 5%
 growth,
 I


don't
 believe
 you.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just


hard
 to
 sustain.
 So,
 how
 does
 that


affect
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world?
 If
 they


push
 that
 money
 out
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world
 in
 the
 form
 of
 trade
 surpluses
 and


such,
 it'll
 have
 a
 big
 effect,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world's


going
 to
 accept
 that.
 So,
 do
 we
 have
 a


some
 kind
 of
 japanification
 in
 China
 now


then?
 Yes,
 we
 do.
 The
 question
 is
 a


matter
 of
 degree.
 So
 we
 those
 of
 us
 who


work
 on
 financial
 crisis
 look
 at
 Sweden


on
 the
 one
 end
 is
 like
 the
 fastest


recovery
 ever
 and
 the
 other
 end
 is
 Japan


which
 by
 some
 measures
 took
 two


decades.
 China's
 Sweden
 time
 is
 over.


That's
 gone.
 They're
 having
 a
 longer


crisis
 than
 that.
 Uh
 it
 looks
 to
 me
 like


it'll
 be
 a
 few
 more
 years
 uh
 to
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 I
 think
 that
 China
 has
 a
 lot
 of


things
 going
 for
 it
 but
 they
 have
 this


over
 centralization
 of
 power
 which
 you


know
 may
 undermine
 their
 longer
 term


growth
 but
 it's
 uh
 you
 know
 certainly


the
 the
 the
 deflation
 the
 slow
 growth


the
 housing
 problem
 the
 overbuilding
 in


infrastructure
 and
 housing
 the


similarities
 are
 are
 really
 quite


remarkable.
 What
 about
 their
 ability
 to


intervene
 in
 the
 market
 in
 different


ways?
 Well,
 the
 thing
 is
 where
 China
 was


doing
 really
 well
 was
 their
 private


sector.
 They're
 they
 were
 very


innovative.
 There
 are
 areas
 of
 tech


where
 they're
 just
 fantastic
 and
 uh


they're
 great
 investments
 in
 China
 if


you
 could
 make
 them
 now.
 But
 they
 they


crush
 them.
 You
 know,
 famously
 Jack
 Ma


who
 recently
 reappeared
 had
 sort
 of
 he's


the
 founder
 of
 Alibaba
 and
 one
 of the


great
 innovators
 at
 China
 just
 sort
 of


disappeared
 and
 you
 know
 he
 was
 a
 little


too
 vocal
 about
 his
 power.
 They
 started


putting
 uh
 party
 hacks
 on
 the
 boards
 of


financial
 firms
 of
 you
 know
 uh
 their


tech
 companies.
 So
 they
 need
 to
 go
 back


to
 this
 growth
 model
 where
 the
 private


sector
 leads
 and
 the
 states
 not
 doing


everything.
 But
 President
 Xi's
 been
 very


reluctant
 to
 let
 go
 of
 that
 power.
 He's


worried
 about
 instability.
 There
 is


quite
 a
 bit
 of
 manufacturing
 moving
 out


of
 China.
 How
 does
 this
 impact
 the


situation?
 Well,
 I
 mean
 there's
 still


quite
 a
 manufacturing
 force,
 but
 it's


reduced
 invest.
 It's
 reduced
 investment


into
 China.
 So
 uh
 it's
 been
 great
 for


Japan,
 for
 Korea,
 for
 Singapore,


Malaysia,
 even
 Indonesia
 and
 India.
 So


as
 you
 well
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


have
 this
 China
 plus
 one
 strategy,


meaning
 we're
 leaving
 our
 stuff
 in


China.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 can't
 get
 it


out
 right
 now
 anyway.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


do
 our
 new
 investments
 uh
 we're
 going
 to


do
 our
 new
 investments
 somewhere
 else.


But
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 alone
 is
 the


big
 thing.
 The
 big
 thing
 is
 that


housing,
 real
 estate's
 plummeting.


Consumers
 are
 panicked.
 They
 don't
 trust


the
 government.
 They're
 not
 spending.


That's
 really
 the
 big
 impetus
 of
 why


they're
 so
 going
 growing
 so
 slowly.
 A


few
 sentences
 on
 India.
 Where
 do
 you
 see


that?
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 India's
 been
 a


positive
 story
 for
 a
 while,
 right?
 I


mean,
 uh,
 we
 can
 still
 point
 to
 a
 lot
 of


problems
 in
 India,
 but
 they
 have
 faster


growth
 rates
 than
 China.
 Who'd
 have


thought
 that?
 and
 seemed
 to
 be
 for
 a


while.
 Uh
 Modi
 is
 building


infrastructure
 finally
 uh
 in
 India
 that


you
 know
 is
 laying
 the
 groundwork
 for


future
 growth.
 They
 still
 have
 myriad


problems.
 A
 few
 monopolies
 dominate
 a


lot
 of
 the
 economy.
 We're
 talking
 about


Donald
 Trump's
 tariffs.
 India
 is
 already


there
 and
 they
 they've
 actually
 come


down
 some
 but
 you
 know
 not
 uh
 not
 not


enough.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 doing
 well.
 I


sorry
 I
 have
 to
 come
 back
 to
 chess.
 The


uh
 he's
 not
 he's
 not
 as
 good
 as
 uh
 your


boy
 Magnus
 Carlson
 who
 pulled
 out
 of


things
 but
 you
 know
 the
 world
 champion


Gash
 is
 from
 India.
 Amazing.
 And
 there


they
 won
 the
 world
 team
 championship


too.
 Um
 I
 think
 I
 sent
 you
 I
 think
 I


sent
 you
 the
 podcast
 with
 Magnus


Carlson.
 You
 you
 did.
 You
 did.
 Um
 and


thank
 you.
 And
 so
 you
 know
 um
 if
 you
 can


do
 that
 you
 can
 do
 other
 things.
 And
 so


I'm
 that
 you
 know
 there
 there
 I'm
 I'm


optimistic
 but
 it's
 hard
 to
 get
 euphoric


about
 India
 because
 it's
 just
 so
 hard
 to


govern
 a
 country
 of
 1.4
 billion
 people.


Moving
 on
 um
 to
 inflation.
 Um
 how
 has


your
 uh
 view
 on
 inflation
 changed
 over


the
 last
 10
 years?
 So
 I
 have
 always


thought
 inflation
 was
 in
 remission
 and


not
 dead.
 And
 my
 academic
 papers
 have


made
 this


case.
 My
 colleagues
 across
 all
 of


academics,
 I
 think,
 became
 in
 somehow


mesmerized,
 brainwashed
 by
 central
 banks


saying
 there's
 never
 going
 to
 be


inflation,
 nothing
 to
 worry
 about.
 That


assumption
 of
 no
 inflation
 is
 hardwired


into
 all
 the
 top
 journal
 papers
 that


have
 been
 coming
 out.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 have
 a


paper
 with
 some
 co-authors
 that
 has
 a


different
 idea.
 I
 think
 in
 fact
 the


period
 where
 inflation
 was
 really
 low
 uh


the
 central
 banks
 were
 good
 going
 back


to
 Ben
 Larson
 but
 they
 were
 also
 lucky


because
 globalization
 helped
 the
 rise
 of


China
 helped.
 There
 was
 a
 general


consensus
 away
 from
 populist
 policies


more
 or
 less
 and
 that
 helped.
 They
 had


the
 they
 had
 the
 wind
 at
 their
 backs.


Now
 they
 don't.
 And
 not
 only
 did
 they


have
 the
 wind
 at
 their
 backs
 in
 terms
 of


these
 techno
 factors,
 but
 the
 politics


were
 leave
 the
 central
 bank
 alone.
 And


that
 has
 been
 thrown
 by
 the
 wayside
 in


in
 many
 countries.
 So
 inflation
 doesn't


have
 to
 be
 high.
 The
 central
 banks
 can


control
 inflation.
 But
 e
 economists,


prognosticators,
 opinion
 makers
 had
 just


forgotten
 that
 inflation's
 a
 political


economy
 problem.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 really


have
 central
 bank
 independence,
 that's


the
 core
 of
 it,
 you're
 going
 to


periodically
 run
 into
 trouble.
 Is
 2%
 uh


still
 a
 realistic
 target?
 Well,
 I
 mean,


I
 uh
 you're
 asking,
 are
 they
 going
 to


ever
 get
 down
 to
 2%
 again?
 I
 think
 what


I
 think
 is
 they
 will
 but
 we
 will
 see
 in


the


next
 my
 book
 says
 5
 to
 seven
 years
 but


that
 was
 the
 I
 did
 the
 page
 the
 final


day
 of
 page
 proof
 was
 just
 the
 day
 after


Trump
 got
 elected
 I
 might
 make
 that
 a


little
 faster
 now
 than
 5
 to
 seven
 years


there's
 going to
 be
 another
 big
 burst
 of


inflation
 similar
 to
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 the


uh
 after
 the
 pandemic
 what's
 going
 to


cause
 that
 surge
 what's
 going
 to
 cause


That
 will
 be
 another
 shock


where
 the
 central
 banks
 are,
 you
 know,


get
 put
 into
 a
 corner
 where
 they
 worry


about
 recession,
 they
 worry
 about


inflation,
 but
 the
 pressures
 are
 going


to
 be
 towards
 worrying
 about
 having
 a


recession
 and
 they're
 just
 not
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 stand
 up
 to
 the
 politics
 the


way
 they
 might
 have
 say
 in
 2008
 and


2009.
 So,
 you
 it
 depends
 on
 what
 kind
 of


shock
 we
 get.
 If
 we
 get
 another
 one
 just


like
 2008,
 we
 won't.
 But
 I
 think
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 kinds
 of
 shocks.
 Call
 it
 a


cyber
 war,
 another
 pandemic
 where
 it's


very
 hard
 to
 maintain
 growth
 and
 keep


inflation
 low.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it


hard
 to
 put
 my
 finger
 on
 exactly
 what
 it


would
 be,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 kinds
 of
 shocks


could
 make
 could
 make
 them
 need
 to
 raise


interest
 rates.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 really


what
 we're
 talking
 about.
 uh
 US
 debt


being
 out
 of
 control
 if
 that
 goes
 and
 I


don't
 know
 what's
 happening
 but
 my
 best


guess
 is
 that
 both
 parties
 want
 it
 to
 go


up
 and
 it
 will
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 put


upward
 pressure
 on
 interest
 rates
 and
 if


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 raises
 interest


rates
 no
 problem
 there
 won't
 be


inflation
 good
 luck
 with
 that
 even
 if


Trump
 wasn't
 president
 it's
 ve
 they're


already
 high
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 do
 so


it's
 I'm
 making
 a
 political
 economy
 call


I'm
 not
 saying
 there's
 some,
 you
 know,


constellation
 of
 shocks
 that's
 just


going
 to
 happen
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 and


create
 inflation.
 I'm
 saying
 that
 when


the
 going
 gets
 tough,
 some
 of
 the,
 you


know,
 some
 of
 them
 are
 going
 to
 hide
 and


not
 fight
 the
 fight.
 When
 do
 you
 think


we'll
 start
 to
 see
 it
 uh
 move
 up?
 Well,


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 like
 forecasting
 a


financial
 crisis.
 We
 can
 say
 what


happens
 once
 the
 shock
 hits.
 uh
 you
 know


at
 the
 moment
 uh
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 it


happening
 at
 all
 near-term.
 What
 would


be
 the
 most
 likely
 trigger?
 What's
 the


what's
 what
 are
 the
 most
 important


things
 you
 look
 at?
 I
 mean
 h
 having
 some


the
 most
 likely
 trigger
 for
 getting
 a


really
 big
 shock
 is
 some
 out
 ofthebox


thing
 happening
 that
 we
 haven't
 seen


before
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 uh
 such
 as


such
 as
 what?
 Well
 well
 let
 me
 throw
 out


another
 pandemic
 because
 that's
 an
 easy


one.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 the
 possibility
 of


a
 say
 a
 cyber
 war
 is
 not
 far
 off.
 And
 uh


and
 just
 explain
 to
 us
 why
 a
 so
 cyber


war
 will
 drive
 inflation.
 Well,
 it
 cuts


growth
 and
 then
 the
 government
 uh
 does


stuff
 to
 try
 to
 hold
 up
 consumption
 by


spending
 money.
 Uh
 a
 debt
 event
 debt


doesn't
 just
 mechanically
 turn
 into


inflation.
 That's
 wrong.
 It
 either
 turns


into
 higher
 interest
 rates
 or
 inflation.


And
 at
 some
 point,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


there'll
 be
 pressures


to,
 you
 know,
 they'll
 they'll
 pack
 the


central
 bank
 with
 people
 who
 we
 call


doves.
 It
 hasn't
 happened,
 but,
 you


know,
 it
 could.
 Or
 obviously,
 we
 have


Trump
 here
 and
 he
 has
 said
 he
 thinks


he's
 smarter
 than
 the
 central
 bankers.


He'd
 like
 a
 bigger
 voice.
 A
 thing
 a
 lot


of
 people
 don't
 understand
 is
 the


central
 this
 the
 Fed
 is
 not
 the
 Supreme


Court.
 It
 does
 not
 have
 that
 kind
 of


constitutional
 status
 that
 the
 ECB
 does


have.
 And
 it
 it
 could
 disappear
 in
 a


week.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it
 isn't
 just


Trump
 that
 wants
 it
 to
 disappear.
 The


left
 wants
 it
 to
 disappear,
 too.
 They


have
 all
 these
 plans.
 They
 want
 to,
 you


know,
 have
 it
 print
 money
 and
 give
 it


away
 to
 people.
 So,
 there's
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 pressures
 on
 on
 the
 Fed's


independence
 coming
 from
 both
 sides
 of


the
 spectrum.
 One
 more
 question
 before


we
 spend
 more
 time
 on
 the
 Fed.
 uh
 the


climate,
 how
 can
 the
 climate
 suddenly


uh
 impact
 inflation
 in
 your
 mind?
 Well,


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 a
 thing
 that
 is
 likely


is
 that
 storms
 are
 going
 to
 get
 worse.


So,
 I
 think
 a
 big
 thing
 that
 we've


learned
 over
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 it
 had


always
 been
 about
 what
 was
 going
 to


happen
 in
 2100,
 was
 that
 these
 storms


and
 climate
 extremes
 that
 we're


experiencing
 are
 coming
 faster.
 So
 you


have
 natural
 catastrophes
 which
 lower


output
 and
 put
 upward
 pressure.
 You


could
 have
 uh
 geopolitical
 issues
 arise


say
 with
 migration.
 Al
 Gore
 writes
 about


that
 talks
 about
 this
 a
 lot.
 So
 I
 think


the
 climates
 providing
 I
 think
 I'm
 glad


you
 raised
 it
 because
 I
 should
 have
 said


it.
 You
 could
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 climate


shock
 that's
 just
 out
 of
 the
 box.
 we


don't
 know
 how
 to
 deal
 with
 it
 and
 uh
 we


deal
 with
 it
 by
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money


which
 I'm
 not
 saying
 would
 necessarily


be
 wrong
 but
 you
 then
 have
 a
 choice
 do


you
 raise
 interest
 rates
 or
 do
 you
 allow


inflation
 to
 go
 up
 and
 I
 bet
 we'd
 allow


inflation
 to
 go
 up
 just
 coming
 back
 to


the
 uh
 political
 pressures
 that
 the
 Fed


is
 facing
 now
 just
 what
 uh
 could
 you


elaborate
 a
 bit
 more
 on
 that
 please?


Well,
 I
 mean
 the
 mo
 the
 most
 fundamental


point
 is
 that
 Fed
 independence
 is
 a
 new


thing.
 Uh
 central
 bank
 independence
 is
 a


new
 thing.
 I
 mean
 the
 Fed
 was
 not
 the


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 this
 grand


building
 that
 you
 see
 pictures
 of,


you've
 probably
 been


to
 in
 the
 20s
 and
 you
 know
 early
 30s.


They
 were
 in
 a
 room
 in
 the
 Treasury
 a


few
 people.
 This
 whole
 they
 were
 part
 of


the
 treasury.
 most
 countries
 the
 central


bank
 was
 part
 of
 the
 treasury.
 The


notion
 of
 central
 bank
 independence


which
 I
 by
 the
 way
 I
 think
 I
 wrote
 the


first
 paper
 on
 uh
 just
 40
 years
 ago
 now


and
 back
 then
 almost
 no
 one
 had


independent
 central
 banks.
 It's
 new.


It's
 experimental
 and
 there
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 saying
 well
 it's
 had
 its


benefits
 but
 now
 that
 inflation's
 down


we
 don't
 need
 it
 anymore.
 it
 we
 it
 was


useful
 to
 bring
 inflation
 down.
 Now
 we


don't
 need
 it,
 which
 of
 course,
 you


know,
 they
 don't
 they
 don't
 see
 that


that's
 why
 inflation's
 down
 because
 you


have
 central
 bank
 independence.
 Uh
 but


it's
 it's
 political.
 It
 it
 doesn't
 have


to
 be.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not
 something,
 you


know,
 that's
 in
 our
 constitution.
 I


couldn't
 comment
 on
 the
 ECB
 really
 is


remarkably
 more
 independent,
 but
 I
 think


in
 most
 countries
 that's
 not
 the
 case.


So,
 how


likely
 are
 we
 to
 see
 that
 the
 Fed
 loses


its
 independence?
 Well,
 that's
 a
 strong


statement
 of,
 you
 know,
 loses
 its


independence.
 What
 I
 would
 say
 is


near-term
 likely,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 come


back
 to
 drawing
 parallels
 between
 Trump


and
 Nixon,
 I
 think
 after
 he's
 done
 with


Doge
 and
 all
 this
 pseudo
 cutting,
 which


isn't
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 that
 much
 and


finally
 gets
 to
 the
 big
 tax
 uh
 cuts
 and


other
 stimulus.
 And
 maybe
 by
 creating
 a


recession
 out
 of
 thin
 air,
 Trump
 will


have
 provided
 political
 cover
 for
 him
 to


do
 all
 this
 stimulus.
 We
 are
 going
 to


start
 to
 get
 inflation
 pressures.
 Trump


is
 not
 going
 to
 like
 it.
 Trump
 is
 not
 a


person
 who
 sits
 back
 and
 quietly
 takes


things
 when
 he
 doesn't
 like
 it.
 I
 I


think,
 and
 this
 may
 sound
 really
 out


there,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 Nixon


like
 price
 controls
 like
 we
 saw
 in
 the


1970s.
 Maybe,
 you
 know,
 other
 kinds
 of


controls.
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 things


like
 we
 uh
 Reinhardt
 and
 I
 label


financial
 repression
 which
 we
 have
 to


some
 degree
 now
 since
 the
 financial


crisis
 where
 banks
 and
 financial
 firms


are
 forced
 to
 hold
 more
 debt
 at
 ending


up
 at
 lower
 returns
 than
 they'd
 like.
 So


I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 wilder


stuff
 like
 that
 is
 coming
 to
 a
 theater


near
 you
 soon.
 I
 don't
 think
 we're
 going


to
 wait
 to
 the
 fourth
 year
 of
 the
 Trump


presidency
 for
 that.
 That
 stuff
 doesn't


work
 indefinitely.
 It
 works
 for
 a
 little


while
 and
 then
 eventually,
 you
 know,


things
 spin
 out
 of


control.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 in
 for
 a


wild
 ride.
 So,
 sort
 of
 trying
 to
 make
 a


smooth
 prediction
 like
 I
 think
 inflation


in
 2026
 is
 going
 to
 be
 5%.
 I
 I
 don't


know
 what
 side
 of
 bed
 Donald
 Trump's


going
 to
 wake
 up
 up
 on.
 I
 don't
 know


Vladimir
 Putin
 either.
 Uh
 but
 I
 I
 I
 do


see
 this
 willingness
 just
 like
 with
 the


tariffs
 to
 use
 things
 that
 we
 globalist


economists
 think
 are
 bad.
 He'll
 say


they're
 good.
 I
 think
 they're
 good.


He'll
 say
 I
 think
 they're
 good.
 And
 so
 I


I
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 him
 reach


into
 the
 toolkit.
 And
 you
 know,
 Fed


independence
 comes
 later.
 The
 Fed
 does


not
 like
 this
 stuff,
 but
 you
 know,


that's
 that's
 sort
 of
 something
 that


comes
 further
 down
 the
 road.
 Okay.
 So


let's
 say
 now
 inflation
 uh
 climbs,
 jobs


are
 strong,
 politicians
 don't
 want
 rates


higher.
 What
 will
 the
 Fed
 do?
 Oh,
 I


think
 I
 think
 if
 left
 to
 its
 own


devices,
 it
 will
 raise
 interest
 rates.
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 any
 doubt
 about
 it.


What
 form
 will
 the
 pressure
 come?
 Well,


I
 mean
 it's
 it
 it
 the
 the
 immediate


pressure
 if
 jobs
 are
 strong,
 it's


nevertheless
 the
 case
 that
 there
 are


people
 who
 lose
 by
 having
 interest
 rates


high.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 talk
 to
 young


people
 and
 tell
 them,
 "You're
 earning
 a


lot
 more
 than
 I
 did
 at
 your
 age."
 And


they
 say,
 "Yeah,
 but
 look
 what
 a
 house


costs.
 Look
 at
 how
 high
 interest
 rates


are."
 Uh,
 people
 who
 are
 buying
 cars,
 I


mean,
 people
 care
 about
 interest
 rates
 a


lot.
 So,
 uh,
 no,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 the


current
 Fed
 right
 here
 and


now


without
 some,
 you
 know,
 real
 turn
 of
 the


screw
 coming
 from
 Congress,
 coming
 from


the
 president,
 no,
 they're
 they're
 going


to
 raise
 interest
 rates
 if
 they
 see


inflation,
 but
 that's
 that's
 going
 to


lead
 to
 a
 showdown
 at
 some
 point
 because


nothing's
 perfect.
 It's
 not
 just
 going


to
 be
 this
 perfect
 world
 with
 jobs
 going


up
 and
 interest
 rates
 are
 high
 because


everybody's
 doing
 so
 well.
 It's
 it's


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that
 simple.
 So,
 uh


how
 important
 is
 business
 sentiment
 in


shaping
 monetary
 policy?
 Not
 as


important
 as
 consumer
 sentiment
 because


consumer
 sentiment
 70%
 of
 consumers
 are


70%
 of
 consumption.
 But
 it's
 business


sentiment
 is
 certainly
 very
 important.
 I


mean,
 it
 affects
 investment.
 Investment


affects
 future
 growth.
 And
 I'd
 also
 say


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 probably
 takes
 the


business
 forecast
 to
 be
 a
 little
 more


professional
 than
 the
 consumers.
 When


the
 professionals
 are
 saying
 you're


doing
 a
 bad
 job,
 they
 listen
 a
 little


more.
 But
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 the
 Fed
 listens


to
 everybody.
 Business
 sentiment's


important.
 Financial
 market
 sentiment,


political
 sentiment,
 consumer
 sentiment.


They
 even
 listen
 a
 little
 bit
 to


economists
 like
 me.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,


it's
 not
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any
 one


thing
 that's
 oversized.
 Is
 that
 a
 good


thing
 to
 listen
 to
 economists?
 Well,


what
 am
 I
 going
 to
 say?
 No,
 I
 I
 I


I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 you
 know
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 Fed,
 uh
 the
 only
 complaint


I
 would
 have
 about
 my
 professional


colleagues,
 what
 I
 see
 in
 the
 journals


is
 they
 just
 became
 mesmerized
 that


there'd
 never
 be
 inflation.
 Yeah.
 So,


actually
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 have
 really


leaned
 into
 this
 idea
 the
 Fed
 should


deal
 with
 the
 environment,
 social


justice,
 inequality,
 and
 all
 of
 those


things
 are
 really
 important.
 They're


very
 valuable,
 but
 it's
 wrong.
 And


actually,
 a
 survey
 of
 the
 American


Economic
 Association
 just
 a
 couple
 years


ago
 showed
 incredible
 naive
 Tay
 among


academic
 economists
 about
 where
 the


Fed's
 focus
 should
 be.
 It
 should
 be
 on


inflation.
 Should
 central
 banks
 spend


time
 on
 climate
 issues?
 Basically,
 it
 uh


let
 me
 start
 with
 the
 Fed
 and
 I
 would


say
 uh
 of
 course
 they
 should
 follow


whatever
 policy
 is
 set
 by
 Congress,
 but


they
 shouldn't
 be
 leading
 the
 pack.
 The


Fed
 doesn't
 have
 the
 uh
 personnel.
 it


doesn't
 have
 the
 knowledge
 and
 above
 all


it
 doesn't
 have
 the
 democratic


accountability
 to
 be
 the
 leader
 and


pushing
 the
 Fed
 to
 be
 the
 leader
 in


climate
 change
 is
 just
 a
 ticket
 to


having
 it
 lose
 its
 focus
 and
 I
 would
 say


you
 know
 I
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing


about
 inequality
 and
 of
 course
 Fed


policy
 affects
 inequality
 but
 in
 a
 very


difficult
 to
 calibrate
 way
 Congress


should
 fix
 it
 now
 the
 ECB
 is
 different


and
 my
 friend
 Christine
 Lagarde
 would


certainly
 raise
 her
 eyebrows
 if
 I
 were


saying
 you
 shouldn't
 look
 at
 um
 you
 know


the
 environment
 I
 would
 say
 the
 ECB
 is


following
 Europe
 Europe
 European


dictates
 it's
 not
 telling
 it's
 not


making
 its
 own
 forecast
 of
 the


environment
 but
 that
 said
 I
 I
 find
 it


very
 thin
 pretext
 for
 having
 the
 ECB
 uh


intervene
 by
 saying
 you're
 not
 worrying


about
 the
 business
 risks
 coming
 from
 the


environment
 enough.
 We're
 worrying
 about


the
 business
 risks.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think


businesses
 are
 pretty
 good
 at
 worrying


about
 their
 own
 business
 risks.
 So,
 it


it
 shouldn't
 be
 that
 that
 central
 banks


should
 be
 a
 team
 player,
 but
 very
 much
 a


follower
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


environment.
 Talking
 about
 what
 central


banks
 should
 or
 shouldn't
 do,
 uh
 should


they
 publish
 forward
 guidance
 curves
 for


interest
 rates?
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 been


overdone.
 I
 think
 the
 whole
 thing
 that


came
 under
 another
 friend
 of
 mine,
 Ben


Bernani,
 uh,
 who
 is,
 you
 know,
 a
 great


Fed
 chair,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 whole
 thing


about
 here's
 the
 dot
 plot
 here
 that
 that


tells
 where
 they
 think
 interest
 rates


are
 going.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 here's


everything
 we
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 do,


it
 got
 overdone.
 And
 the
 the
 problem
 is,


uh,
 markets
 don't
 believe
 it.
 And
 then


you
 get
 to
 a
 year
 later
 and
 the
 Fed's
 a


little
 bit
 tied
 its
 hands
 by
 giving
 this


forward
 guidance
 or
 the
 central
 bank,


the
 Bank
 of
 England,
 the
 Central
 Bank
 of


Norway,
 they
 they've
 tied
 their
 hands
 a


little
 bit
 and
 you
 know,
 in
 some
 sense


they're
 the
 only
 ones
 listening
 to


themselves.
 But
 how
 how
 tied
 are
 they?


How
 tied
 are
 they
 by
 their
 own
 forecast?


Well,
 they're
 not
 completely
 tied,
 but


it's
 awkward,
 you
 know.
 Was
 it
 was
 that


the
 reason
 why
 the
 why
 the
 ECB
 was
 slow


to
 increase
 rates,
 for
 instance?
 You


think?
 Well,
 I
 think
 they
 I
 I
 think
 I


think
 part
 partly
 it
 was
 a
 case
 where
 a


lot
 of
 people
 were
 thrown
 off
 in
 their


forecasts.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the
 main
 reason


everyone
 was
 slow
 to
 increase
 rates


really
 was
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 be
 the


things
 looked
 like
 they
 could
 get
 really


bad.
 They
 didn't
 get
 really
 bad
 and
 they


were
 trying
 to
 be
 cautious.
 I
 I
 just


want
 to
 make
 one
 point
 about
 this.
 I


often
 hear
 the
 line
 that
 well
 it
 was


just
 the
 supply
 side.
 It
 was
 just
 supply


chain
 problems
 that
 made
 prices
 go
 up.


That's
 why
 we
 had
 inflation.
 Okay,
 fine.


But
 then
 the
 supply
 chain
 problems
 went


away.
 Why
 didn't
 the
 price
 of
 paper


towels
 come
 down?
 Why
 didn't
 the
 price


of
 everything
 come
 down?
 That
 was
 a


central
 bank
 mistake.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they


we
 could
 go
 off
 into
 the
 theory
 of
 it


that
 they
 should
 look
 through
 temporary


shocks,
 but
 they
 this
 was
 a
 big
 shock.


They
 they
 screwed
 up
 on
 this.
 They
 they


should
 have
 raised
 interest
 rates


sooner.
 Yeah.
 Moving
 on
 to
 debt.
 Uh
 is


the
 current
 level
 of
 US
 debt


sustainable?
 Well,
 yes
 and
 no.
 I
 mean,


uh
 no
 in
 the
 sense
 with
 on
 its
 current


path,
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 resolved


by
 inflation.
 Uh
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 I


I
 think
 again
 going
 back
 to
 my


colleagues
 in
 the
 profession,
 there
 were


these
 people
 who
 argued
 interest
 rates


would
 be
 lower
 forever.
 Larry
 Summers


had
 this
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you've
 ever
 had


this
 line
 in
 your
 podcast,
 secular


stagnation.
 We're
 never
 going
 to
 grow


again.
 Uh
 interest
 rates
 will
 be
 low.


We're
 not
 inventing
 anything.


Everybody's
 getting
 old.
 And
 I
 I
 I


debated
 this
 with
 him
 uh
 10
 years
 ago.


Paul
 Krugman,
 even
 Peter
 Teal,
 actually


Gary
 Kasparov
 uh
 at
 one
 time.
 And
 I've


always
 thought,
 you
 know,
 that
 people


are
 very
 short.
 They're
 looking
 at
 the


recent
 past
 too
 much.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at


a
 longer
 time
 period,
 you
 would
 see
 that


this
 period
 of
 low
 interest
 rates
 was


going
 to
 go
 away.
 I
 think
 it
 has.
 And
 if


it
 if
 interest
 rates
 come
 way
 down,


well,
 any
 debt
 sustainable
 if
 you
 don't


have
 to
 pay
 interest
 on
 it.
 But
 with
 the


level
 we
 have
 and
 the
 uh
 rate
 it's


going,
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 be
 need


needing
 to
 make
 adjustments.
 I
 don't


think
 politicians
 have
 prepared
 people


to
 make
 the
 adjustments.
 So
 at
 the
 you


know
 what
 I
 see
 happening
 eventually
 and


it'll
 happen
 together
 with
 a
 big
 shock


like
 we
 discussed
 pandemic
 we're
 going


to
 have
 a
 a
 big
 inflation
 that's
 going


to
 partly
 bring
 the
 debt
 down
 but
 this


time
 interest
 rates
 are
 going
 to
 go
 up
 a


lot
 more.
 uh
 investors
 were
 forgiving


last
 time
 to
 both
 the
 ECB
 and
 the
 Fed


and
 others
 that
 okay
 that
 was
 an


accident
 we
 really
 believe
 you
 it's
 not


going
 to
 happen
 again
 you
 know
 fool
 me


once
 shame
 on
 shame
 on
 you
 etc
 uh
 so
 I
 I


think
 we're
 eventually
 going
 to
 have
 to


make
 these
 adjustments
 but
 so
 far
 no


one's
 really
 been
 prepared
 for
 that
 what


kind
 of


adjustments
 can
 we
 see
 well
 you
 either


lower
 raise
 taxes
 or
 lower
 spending.
 I


mean,
 you
 have
 to
 do
 something
 to
 do


with
 adjusting
 what
 you're
 spending.
 The


US
 is
 running
 a
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 7%
 of
 GDP


deficit
 this
 year.
 I
 mean,
 and
 it'll


come
 down
 a
 bit,
 but
 who
 knows
 how
 much.


Uh,
 all
 the
 projections
 are
 the
 debts


currently
 at
 36
 trillion.
 The


Congressional
 Budget
 Office,
 I
 think,


has
 it
 going
 to
 65
 trillion
 in
 10
 years.


So
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 things
 you
 can
 I'm


not
 tell
 I
 I'm
 not
 about
 what
 you
 should


adjust.
 I'm
 not
 about
 the
 size
 of


government.
 That's
 a
 separate
 question.


But
 you
 know
 some
 kind
 of
 adjustments


will
 need
 to
 be
 made.
 And
 one
 of the


things
 that
 has
 really
 puzzled
 me


throughout
 all
 this
 is
 that
 particularly


on
 the
 left
 they
 just
 want
 to
 make
 debt


really
 big.
 That's
 been
 the
 argument
 for


a
 long
 time.
 Anyone
 who
 thinks
 that
 big


debt
 is
 a
 problem
 is
 in
 favor
 of


austerity.
 They
 think
 you
 must
 not
 want


to
 give
 people
 stuff.
 And
 I
 would
 say


no,
 just
 raise
 taxes.
 If
 you
 want
 to


give
 people
 more
 stuff
 and
 bigger


transfers,
 all
 for
 it,
 more
 power
 to


you,
 but
 raise
 taxes.
 This
 whole
 idea
 of


it's
 a
 free
 lunch.
 You
 can
 just
 give


everything
 away.
 You're
 shooting


yourself
 in
 the
 foot,
 which
 the
 Biden


administration
 did
 to
 some
 extent.
 And


on
 the
 right
 they
 say,
 "Oh,
 we
 can
 do


whatever
 we
 want
 because
 when
 we
 cut


taxes,
 growth
 just
 soarses,
 doesn't
 cost


anything."
 And
 it
 soarses
 a
 little,
 but


it
 doesn't
 pay
 for
 itself.
 So,
 they've


both
 been
 telling
 this
 fiction,
 which
 I


think
 now
 interest
 rates
 are
 saying
 the


markets
 don't
 believe.
 Where
 is
 the
 debt


level
 where
 investors
 suddenly
 will


demand
 a
 sharply
 higher
 coupon?
 No,
 but


I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 in
 the
 case
 of


the
 United
 States
 that
 happens
 because


we
 we
 have
 the
 inflation
 card
 to
 play


and
 you
 can
 play
 it
 a
 little,
 you
 can


play
 it
 a
 lot.
 So
 when
 you
 go
 to
 an


emerging
 market
 uh
 that
 borrows
 in


dollars,
 it
 can
 happen
 very
 suddenly


that
 Greece
 was
 an
 example.
 They
 were


borrowing
 in
 Euro
 but
 they
 didn't


control
 it
 can
 happen
 very
 suddenly.
 I


think
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 United
 States,


uh,
 it's
 more,
 you'll
 see
 it
 in
 the


interest
 rate,
 but
 probably
 not,
 you


know,
 all
 at
 once.
 It's
 gone
 up
 after


people,
 you
 know,
 see
 what's
 going
 on.


But
 I
 think
 this
 whole
 idea
 I
 I
 mean,


having
 really
 high
 debt
 for
 an
 advanced


country
 weighs
 on
 growth
 because
 it


reduces
 your
 options.
 You
 you're
 a


little
 more
 nervous
 about
 doing


stimulus.
 You're
 a
 little
 more
 numerous


about
 doing
 investment.
 Uh
 but
 it's
 not


it's
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 question
 of
 what


kind
 of
 risk
 what's
 coming
 in
 the


future.
 Let's
 look
 at
 Europe.
 Oops.
 They


have
 to
 build
 up
 their
 military.
 Hm.
 We


didn't
 budget
 for
 that.
 And
 you
 know


that's
 just
 an
 example.
 And
 I
 by
 the
 way


I
 think
 Europe's
 going
 to
 end
 up
 having


to
 put
 a
 lot
 more
 in
 than
 uh
 leaders
 are


beginning
 to
 talk
 about
 yet.
 Why
 do
 you


say
 that?


I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 United
 States
 even
 if


Harris
 had
 won,
 she
 was
 the
 one
 opposing


Trump.
 uh
 is
 not
 prepared
 to
 defend


Europe,
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 Asia
 at
 the


same
 time.
 The
 US
 defense
 budget
 which
 I


was
 like
 8%
 of
 GDP
 uh
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 cold
 war
 is
 3
 and
 a
 half%
 of
 GDP


now.
 I
 think
 it
 will
 go
 up
 uh
 again


regardless
 of
 Harris
 or
 Trump
 winning.


But
 uh
 most
 of
 the
 foreign
 policy


experts
 I
 talked
 to
 think
 the
 US
 does


not
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 project
 power


in
 two
 regions
 at
 once,
 much
 less
 three.


And
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 fall
 to
 Europe
 to


take
 more
 responsibility.
 And
 it's
 it's


not
 just
 going
 to
 2%.
 There's
 decades
 of


underinvestment
 that
 need
 to
 be
 made
 up


for.
 And
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 that's


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 adjustment
 for
 Europe.


Yeah.
 Do
 you
 see
 a
 scenario
 where
 the
 US


defaults
 on
 his
 treasury
 bonds?
 I
 mean,


again,
 it
 would
 be
 so
 good
 for
 sales
 of


my
 book
 with
 Carmen
 Reinhardt
 from
 2009


if
 that
 happened.
 But,
 you
 know,
 and
 it


would
 be
 total
 dysfunction
 to
 do
 that.


It
 would
 be
 so
 stupid
 because
 we
 we
 can


print
 money.
 We
 don't
 need
 to
 default
 on


our
 Treasury
 bonds.
 So,
 uh
 yeah.
 Can
 you


restructure
 them?
 Can
 you
 restructure


them
 into
 longer
 duration
 obligations?


That's
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 What
 already


happened
 after
 the
 financial
 crisis
 was


we
 put
 in
 all
 these
 restrictions
 to
 make


the
 bank
 safer
 that
 had
 them
 basically


hold
 more
 Fed
 debt,
 which
 is
 basically


Treasury
 bonds
 and
 more
 Treasury
 bonds.


So,
 we
 can
 put
 in
 restrictions.
 We
 can


put
 in
 rules.
 The
 US
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 cars.


I
 mean,
 look
 at
 Japan.
 Japan's
 debts


very
 high.
 Their
 growth's
 been
 terrible,


by
 the
 way,
 but
 their
 debts
 very
 high.


They
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 financial
 repression


in
 Japan.
 And
 they
 haven't
 had
 growth,


but
 there
 if
 if
 you're
 printing
 one
 of


the
 big
 currencies
 that
 and
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 cards
 you
 can
 play.
 So
 looking


for
 something
 sudden
 a
 sudden
 turn
 I


think's,
 you
 know,
 not
 where
 it's
 going.


Of
 course,
 in
 the
 real
 the
 10-year


inflation
 index
 Treasury
 when
 Larry


Summers
 did
 a
 secular
 stagnation
 speech


was
 average
 zero
 over
 those
 10
 years.


That
 got
 to
 minus
 one.
 Now
 it's
 around


two.
 You
 know,
 it's
 a
 3%
 swing.
 And
 US


uh
 interest
 payments
 have
 gone
 up
 in
 a


short
 period
 from
 250
 billion
 to
 nearly


a
 trillion.
 And
 that's
 very
 painful.
 But


for
 the
 moment
 there
 are
 ways
 to
 adjust


but
 you
 know
 it
 certainly
 one
 doesn't


really
 feel
 like
 comfortable
 with
 what's


going
 on
 right
 now.
 And
 that's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 think
 if
 we
 come
 back
 to


my
 thesis
 that
 the
 US
 dollar
 peaked
 in


2015,
 there's
 the
 competition
 from


China,
 crypto,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 big


problems
 are
 inside
 the
 unwillingness
 to


confront
 debt,
 concerns
 about
 the


independence
 of
 the
 central
 bank.
 Uh,


you
 know,
 just
 like
 that
 was
 the
 problem


in
 Rome
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 I
 think


that's
 also
 going
 to
 weaken
 the
 dollar


and
 the
 dollar's
 footprint
 a
 lot.
 In
 uh


Euro
 and
 Carmen's
 book
 um
 this
 time
 is


different.
 You
 lay
 out
 the
 potential


consequences
 of
 big
 uh
 debt
 buildups.


Now,
 how
 did
 the
 aftermath
 of
 the


financial
 crisis
 match
 your
 predictions?


Well,
 actually,
 you
 know,
 uncannily
 so.


I
 mean
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 we
 we
 gave


that
 by
 the
 way
 uh
 we
 were
 looking
 at


private
 financial
 crisis
 and
 not


government
 debt
 crisis
 and
 what
 we're


talking
 about
 um
 and
 and
 I
 think
 what


you're
 talking
 about
 but
 um
 you
 know
 if


you
 look
 at
 uh
 how
 much
 unemployment


went
 up
 on
 average
 in
 the
 US
 how
 long
 it


lasted


um
 uh
 how
 much
 uh
 uh
 stock
 markets
 fell


fell,
 how
 much
 housing
 prices
 fell.
 It


was
 remarkably
 uh
 on
 our
 on
 our


averages.
 We
 we
 didn't
 write
 them
 as


predictions.
 We
 just
 said
 these
 are
 the


averages.
 There
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 people


making
 fun
 of
 us
 when
 our
 book
 came
 out.


The
 New
 York
 Times
 had
 almost
 a
 two-page


article
 saying
 these
 crazy
 people
 think


this
 recession's
 going
 to
 last
 a
 long


time.
 They
 think
 the
 stock
 market's


going
 to
 go
 down
 further.
 They
 think


housing
 prices
 won't
 come
 back
 for


years.
 And
 uh
 you
 know
 now
 the
 de
 you


know
 the
 debate
 is
 certainly
 changed
 uh


around
 financial
 crisis.
 Why
 um
 haven't


the
 big
 debt
 levels
 in
 Europe
 been
 a


problem?
 Yeah.
 But
 I
 mean
 so
 we
 didn't


write
 about
 that
 in
 our
 book.
 We
 had
 a


paper
 papers
 after
 that.
 We
 just
 argued


it
 weighed
 on
 growth.
 When
 you're
 a
 big


rich
 country
 it's
 the
 case
 of
 Japan.
 So


if
 you
 look
 at
 Italy,
 you
 look
 at
 Japan,


obviously
 Greece,
 but
 you
 can
 go
 to


France,
 this
 has
 weighed
 on
 growth.
 Uh


the
 the
 Europe
 has
 wildly
 underperformed


the
 last
 10
 years.
 And
 how
 much
 of
 this


is
 due
 to
 the
 high
 debt
 levels,
 you


think?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the
 high
 debt


levels
 some
 of
 the
 responses


that
 Europe
 needs
 to
 uh
 invest
 more
 in


infrastructure
 to
 improve
 education


uh
 on
 occasion
 to
 do
 uh
 stimulus
 when


there's
 a
 transaction.
 I
 I
 you
 know
 I


would
 say
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 wouldn't
 want
 to


overstate
 the
 weight.
 It's
 very
 hard
 to


parse
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 you


know
 how
 much
 uh
 particularly
 after
 the


global
 financial
 crisis,
 look
 at
 the
 low


debt
 countries
 and
 how
 much
 they
 were


able
 to
 stimulate
 their
 economies,
 they


did
 better.
 Germany
 is
 able
 to
 do
 stuff


now
 because
 it
 has
 saved
 for
 a
 rainy
 day


and
 it's
 a
 rainy
 day
 and
 they're
 making


use
 of
 it.
 I
 I
 think
 they
 should
 have


made
 use
 of
 it
 sooner,
 but
 yeah,
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 you
 spend


the
 money
 obviously.
 I
 mean,
 debt's
 not


the
 be
 all
 and
 end
 all
 of
 uh
 macro


policy.
 You
 care
 about
 education,


investment,
 uh
 you
 know,
 helping
 with
 uh


smoothing
 over
 recessions,
 but
 the


people
 who
 Let
 me
 put
 this
 another
 way.


Running
 deficits
 is
 great.
 It's
 good
 for


your
 economy.
 Having
 a
 big
 debt
 is
 not


good
 for
 your
 economy
 because
 it


prevents
 you
 from
 as
 easily
 running


deficits.
 And
 there
 are
 all
 these
 people


who
 said
 you
 shouldn't
 care.
 It
 doesn't


matter
 a
 wit.
 And
 that
 that
 was
 that
 was


nutty
 and
 unfortunately
 became
 almost
 uh


a
 religion
 in
 some
 circles.
 I
 think
 if


you
 add
 up
 all
 the
 all
 the
 government


debt
 across
 the
 world
 according
 to
 IMF


where
 you
 were
 the
 chief
 economist
 for


some
 time
 u
 it's
 100
 trillion
 dollars


right
 what
 so
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


here
 given
 what
 you
 are
 seeing
 now
 uh


deglobalization
 tariffs
 um
 central
 bank


independence


um
 I
 mean
 all
 the
 geopolitical
 issues
 we


see
 just
 how
 how
 will
 this
 mountain
 of


debt
 pan
 out.
 Well,
 so
 the
 good
 news
 is


that
 central
 bank
 independence
 up
 to


this
 point
 has
 worked.
 It's
 given
 people


more
 confidence.
 It
 allowed
 uh
 debt


levels
 to
 be
 higher
 maybe
 than
 they


would
 have
 otherwise.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 this
 question
 has
 to
 do
 with


where
 do
 you
 think
 interest
 rates
 are


going?
 That
 you
 people
 often
 say
 is
 this


debt
 level
 high?
 Is
 that
 debt
 level


high?
 Well,
 tell
 me
 what
 interest
 rate


you're
 paying
 and
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a
 lot


better
 answer.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 this
 debate


around
 debt
 took
 place
 when
 there
 was


this,
 you
 know,
 zealous
 belief
 that


interest
 rates
 would
 stay
 zero.
 And
 so,


why
 ever
 think
 about
 it?
 They're
 not.


They're
 they're
 not
 in
 your
 country.


They're
 not
 in
 my
 country.
 Uh
 they're


not
 in
 many
 places
 around
 the
 world.
 And


interest
 payments
 have
 gone
 up.
 It's


more
 painful.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


countries
 will
 need
 to
 make
 adjustments,


but
 it's
 it's
 not
 something
 that,
 you


know,
 necessarily
 precipitates
 change


immediately.
 You
 know,
 the
 next
 time


there's
 a
 big
 crisis
 in
 Europe
 with


these
 kind
 of
 interest
 rates,
 it
 maybe


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 harder
 to
 work


out
 a
 package
 when
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like


a
 free
 lunch.
 I
 I
 think
 what
 Europe
 did


during
 the
 pandemic
 was
 great,
 but


interest
 rates
 were
 negative,
 so
 wasn't


very
 hard
 to
 persuade
 the
 Germans
 to
 do


it.
 Now
 they're
 not.
 Can
 we
 spend
 a


moment
 on
 technology?
 Is
 there
 a


um
 could
 it
 be
 that
 we
 potentially


underestimate
 the
 deflationary
 effect
 of


new
 technology
 including
 AI?
 What
 do
 you


think?
 Absolutely
 we
 could.
 Um
 so
 you


know
 it's
 possible
 that
 technology
 will


produce
 an
 effect
 like
 globalization
 did


putting
 downward
 pressure
 on
 wages
 and


putting
 downward
 uh
 pressure
 on
 prices.


And
 that's
 a
 distinct
 possibility.
 But


on
 the
 other
 hand,
 I
 think
 uh
 AI
 is
 also


going
 to
 lead
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 political


tensions,
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 worker


displacement.
 So
 yes,
 there's
 definitely


a
 bright
 side
 to
 AI
 and
 I've
 been


arguing
 that
 for
 for
 years.
 back
 when
 I


did
 the
 debate
 with
 Peter
 Teal
 and
 Gary


Kasparov
 uh
 just
 over
 a
 decade
 ago,
 they


were
 arguing
 this
 idea
 there
 wouldn't
 be


growth
 again.
 And
 I
 said,
 I'm
 a
 chess


player.
 I
 see
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 AI.


It
 looks
 to
 me
 like
 it's
 going to
 be


good.
 What
 worries
 me
 is
 that
 it's
 going


to
 be
 so


fast.
 Humans,
 mankind,
 will
 not
 be
 able


to
 adjust
 to
 it.
 And
 that's
 what
 worries


me
 right
 now.
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 the


potentially
 chaotic
 change
 that
 could


happen
 with
 AI.
 We
 obviously
 see
 it
 in


warfare
 but
 we
 may
 see
 it
 in
 the


workplace
 as
 well.
 You
 know
 we
 are
 just


seeing
 a
 dramatic
 uh
 increase
 in


efficiency
 in
 our
 firm
 on
 the
 back
 of


it.
 Last
 year
 probably
 15%
 I
 suspect


this
 year
 we'll
 see
 20%
 efficiency
 gain.


is
 just
 you
 know
 totally
 democratize
 the


way
 people
 around
 the
 firm
 here
 code
 and


um
 automate
 and
 uh
 it's
 just


unbelievable
 and
 there
 are
 many
 firms


like
 yours
 so
 that's
 really
 interesting


but
 uh
 it
 creating
 efficiencies
 it's


doing
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 things
 and
 some


people
 like
 you
 know
 Venod
 Kosla
 the


venture
 capitalist
 he
 believes
 that


computer
 will
 be
 free
 labor
 will
 be
 free


on
 the
 back
 of
 robots
 and
 so
 on
 I
 mean


can
 we
 then
 at
 the
 end
 actually
 use
 GDP


to
 measure
 the
 economy.
 Well,
 it's
 been


a
 long
 time
 since
 GDP
 was
 a
 really


accurate
 measure
 of
 the
 economy.
 There


are
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 it
 doesn't
 capture,


but
 uh
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 a
 there's


it's
 a
 very
 difficult
 world
 that
 our


children
 face
 with
 tremendous


uncertainty
 about
 what
 jobs
 are.
 Uh
 I


see
 so
 many
 people
 graduate
 college


trying
 to
 see
 how
 to
 make
 a
 million


dollars
 in
 a
 year
 because
 they
 don't


know
 what
 they'll
 be
 doing
 in
 three


years.
 they
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 plan
 a


career
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 away.
 It's


very
 unsettling.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 try
 to
 be
 an


optimist
 about
 it,
 but
 I
 I
 don't
 buy


this
 idea
 that
 don't
 worry
 about


inflation
 because
 this
 is
 going
 to
 make


everything
 cheaper.
 These
 political


pressures
 on
 central
 banks
 are
 very
 very


powerful.
 So
 I
 think
 inflation
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 problem
 for
 the
 next
 several


decades
 even
 though
 I
 do
 think
 AI
 will


transform
 our
 lives.
 Do
 you
 think
 um
 the


high
 valuations
 in
 AI
 related
 companies


uh
 and
 a
 potential
 in
 deflation
 here


could
 trigger
 a
 new
 financial
 crisis?


Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 financial
 crises
 have


come
 because
 there's
 a
 new
 technology


and
 everybody
 gets
 all
 excited
 about
 it.


The
 the
 steam
 engines,
 uh


railroads,
 uh
 airplanes,
 you
 know,
 you


name
 it.
 often
 there's
 a
 new
 technology


everybody
 thinks
 it's
 amazing
 and
 it's


hard
 to
 evaluate
 I
 mean
 hard
 to
 know


what
 what
 it's
 worth
 so
 of
 course


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 around
 it


and
 uh
 there's
 the
 potential
 to
 have
 you


know
 sudden
 valuation
 changes
 collapses


I
 you
 know
 uh
 hesitate
 to
 say
 that
 I


don't
 see
 a
 financial
 crisis
 around
 the


corner
 but
 uh
 I
 don't
 right
 now
 there's


an
 awful
 lot
 of
 regulation
 which
 makes


it
 more
 difficult.
 I
 think
 if
 we
 get
 a


financial
 crisis,
 look
 for
 it
 coming
 out


of
 crypto
 rather
 than
 necessarily
 high


valuations
 of
 AI
 firms.
 Where
 are
 you


the
 most
 different
 from
 other
 economists


in
 your
 views
 now
 you
 think?
 Well,
 where


I
 have
 been
 different
 uh
 for
 some
 uh
 in


many
 places
 over
 the
 years,
 but
 right


now
 where
 I've
 been
 different
 is
 I
 was


sort
 of
 all
 alone
 in
 arguing
 that
 real


interest
 rates
 weren't
 going
 to
 be
 low


forever
 among
 academic
 economists.


people
 write
 in
 opinion
 pages.
 Uh
 I
 was


uh
 alone
 in
 saying
 when
 they
 rise
 debt


which
 seems
 like
 a
 free
 lunch
 today
 uh


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 I
 would
 say
 I
 was


also
 pretty
 isolated
 in
 saying
 China
 was


not
 going
 to
 grow
 to
 the
 moon
 uh
 that
 it


would
 have
 a
 financial
 crisis.
 I
 think


to
 some
 extent
 you
 know
 though
 uh
 I'm


I'm
 still
 fringe
 on
 saying
 those
 things


believe
 it
 or
 not
 but
 less
 so.
 One
 thing


I
 say
 in
 my
 book
 uh
 is
 that
 the
 dollar


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 what
 you're
 used
 to.


That
 it
 reached
 its
 peak
 and
 it's
 coming


down.
 That
 is
 way
 out
 of
 consensus.
 And


uh
 I
 again
 I
 I
 I
 think
 we
 did
 see
 some


of
 that
 in
 the
 Nixon
 era.
 I
 think
 we're


going to
 see
 it
 again.
 But
 uh
 you
 know


that
 that
 I
 I've
 sort
 of
 discussed
 over


the
 the
 our
 time
 here
 some
 of
 the


reasons
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 true.
 It's


not
 just
 the
 dollar
 is
 going
 to
 come


down
 in
 value.
 I
 think
 that
 too,
 but


that
 its
 footprint's
 going
 to
 fall.
 We


live
 in
 a
 dollar
 dominant
 world.
 The


dollar
 is
 going
 to
 stay
 first,
 but


gradually
 its
 place
 is
 going
 to
 come


down.
 Well,
 Ken,
 it's
 uh
 been
 amazing
 uh


tapping
 into
 your
 your
 insights
 and
 uh


and
 visions.
 So,
 uh,
 big
 thank
 you
 for


spending
 time
 with
 us
 and,
 uh,
 very
 much


very
 much
 look
 forward
 to
 to
 keeping
 in


touch
 and
 I'm
 just
 so
 happy
 I
 don't
 have


to
 face
 you
 on
 the,
 you
 know,
 on
 the


chessboard.
 You
 do
 fine.
 I
 I
 I
 was
 It's


been
 many
 decades,
 but
 I
 look
 forward
 to


speaking
 to
 you
 again
 soon.
 Very
 good.


Thanks
 a
 million.
 So
 long.
 Bye.
