- [Derek] There are
robots the size of bees,
others that can jump on water,
and some that are powered
by tiny combustion engines
the size of a penny.
One day they could work in swarms,
they could save your
life, or even spy on you.
We got access to the best micro
robotics labs in the world.
- Whoo, that flipped.
- [Derek] To learn
how these robots work
and what are they for.
This video is sponsored by Onshape.
This is a tiny yellow submarine.
Under water, it can move around
by flapping these miniature
wings nine times per second,
but you can use those same wings
when the submarine is out of the water,
only now you have to flap
them 250 times a second
to make it fly.
So, this robot can do both.
It can fly and swim,
but since it weighs only 175 milligrams,
about the mass of two Cheerios,
surface tension is a problem.
- That's a consequence of
physics at a smaller scale.
The surface tension is like a wall
that blocks the transition process.
- This happens because water molecules
are slightly polar.
Groups of these molecules
pull in all directions,
but at the surface there's no water above,
so the pull is only
sideways and downwards.
This imbalance creates
strong, cohesive forces
that compress the surface
into a tightly packed layer,
making it difficult to break.
This is the same effect
that lets water striders walk
on the surfaces of ponds and lakes.
This other robot weighs only 68 milligrams
and by using a spring mechanism
that mimics a flea's leg,
it can jump without breaking
the water's surface,
just like a water strider.
(upbeat music)
(water bubbles)
It's like there's solid ground below.
(water bubbles)
Now that's great if you wanna
stay on top of the water,
but this barrier can also be a problem
if you want to go underwater.
To escape this trap,
the submarine splits water
into hydrogen and oxygen
and then stores these gases
in a buoyancy chamber.
It does this because the
wings are super fragile.
If they started flapping while the robot
was still trapped under water,
they would break right off.
So, the buoyancy from the gas
helps bring the fragile parts
of the robot out of the water,
but the robot is still stuck
in that top layer of surface tension.
So, a sparker inside the
chamber ignites the gas,
and the explosion breaks
the surface tension
and shoots the robot 30
centimeters into the air.
And once it's free, this robot can fly.
This robot found a different way
to break through the surface tension.
It uses these large water
repellent copper pads on its feet
to walk on the water,
but when it needs to dive beneath,
it applies 600 volts to those pads,
which creates a positive charge
that attracts water molecules to it
and breaks the hydrophobic barrier,
and that allows it to sink on command.
(gentle music)
(water gurgling)
Then, once submerged,
it can walk underwater.
Both of these robots were
made by Dr. Kevin Chen at MIT.
- We're looking at the flight room,
and this is where we do all
of our flight experiment.
As you can see, it has
motion capture cameras.
- [Derek] This lab
is one of the only places in the world
where robots this small attempt flight.
- [Henry] Okay, so because
this robot's so small,
it is such low inertia, right?
So, you're saying that
it could flip faster
than any other drone in the world?
- Beyond 7,000 degrees per second.
I mean, you can actually hit the button.
- You'd let me hit the button?
Yeah, I'd love to.
- Ready?
- Yep.
- Okay.
- Three, two, one.
(robot buzzing)
(triumphant music)
(group cheering)
(defeated music)
(robot buzzing)
- We know who's fault it is.
(group laughing)
- [Derek] Getting these
robots flying is tough.
I mean, they're the size of bees,
so the internal mechanisms
have to be even smaller,
like the parts of a watch.
- Yep.
(wing buzzes)
- You got that?
- [Derek] Components
have to be precise
to within five microns.
That's a 10th the width of a human hair.
- In the summer,
we have those very big
flies zipping by in the lab,
and I was making the statement of,
"Oh, they're just showing off."
(group laughing)
- [Henry] Take two.
- Three, two, one.
(robot buzzes)
- Whoo!
(gentle music)
- That flipped.
- There we go.
(group clapping)
- So these bots fly but not like birds.
I mean, they don't soar.
Instead, they have to use
a whole lot more energy,
flapping their wings
hundreds of times per second.
So why do they do that?
Well, it comes down to
this scale phenomenon.
Larger objects typically
have less surface area
relative to their volume,
and that's important.
Let's just approximate a flyer by a cube.
Let's say it's 10 centimeters on a side.
Well then that would have
a volume of 10 by 10 by 10,
or a thousand cubic centimeters,
and it would have an area
of 10 by 10 by six sides,
600 square centimeters.
So the surface area to volume
ratio would be 0.6 to one.
But now imagine we have
a much smaller flyer
that is just one cubic
centimeter in volume.
Well, its surface area is going
to be one by one times six.
That is six square centimeters.
So that's gonna be 10
times the surface area
to volume ratio.
It's gonna have a surface
area to volume ratio
of six to one.
Now why is that so important?
Well, it's because drag
depends on surface area.
So if you have more surface area to volume,
well you're gonna have a lot more drag,
and also, at that small scale,
you'll be much lighter
relative to that drag.
So you're not gonna have as much inertia,
so you'll get pushed
around more by the air,
so you can't just soar
through it like a bird.
And that's why bees
and other insects flap their wings a lot.
What they're doing is
generating swirls of air
above the top of the wing,
and those vortices create
low-pressure zones.
When combined with the high
pressure below the wing,
that is what generates lift.
So they're pushed up into
that low pressure region
by flapping their wings back and forth.
This robot was inspired by
seeds from a maple tree.
(gentle music)
Their unique shape creates
the same swirling vortices
above the seed's leading edge,
and as they fall,
they spin and generate
surprisingly high lift.
These seeds are still just falling,
but if you add miniature electric rotors
to the ends of each wingtip on this robot,
then it can generate enough lift to fly.
(gentle music)
(robot whirring)
But this robot isn't quite insect scale.
It actually weighs about 50
times more than the RoboBees
in Kevin's lab.
So to power something that small,
you can't just use electric motors.
I mean, the magnets and coils
don't scale down effectively
to such a small size.
(gentle music)
So to power the first RoboBees,
they had wings driven by special crystals
called piezoelectric crystals.
By applying a voltage across the crystal,
they contract slightly,
but only around 0.1%,
not nearly enough of a
deflection to make a robot fly.
So roboticists designed a chassis
that mechanically amplifies
the motion 30 times.
If you then turn the voltage on
and off 120 times per second,
the RoboBee flaps its wings and flies.
But there is a downside
to piezoelectric crystals,
which is, they're fragile.
Even a small impact to the
wings and the crystal cracks,
and the RoboBee stops working.
So at MIT, they are building
their RoboBees differently.
- They're so confident that
it will survive being dropped
that they're gonna let me
throw it off of a building.
So, I mean, here we go.
(robot dings)
(laughing)
Okay, we gotta go see it. Come on.
(gentle music)
(henry laughs)
I mean, it looks pretty good.
This is amazing.
Like how does this thing
survive? I have no idea.
- [Derek] Well, these
robots have a secret ingredient.
- So put into scale.
- Okay.
- Zero it.
- [Derek] Instead of using
piezos to drive the wings,
these bees use soft polymers.
They effectively work like tiny muscles.
- Just drop it here.
- [Derek] They take a polymer
and they coat each side
with carbon nanotubes
that creates two effective
conducting plates.
So if you apply opposite
charges to these plates,
that pulls them together,
stretching out the polymer.
But if like charges are applied
to both plates, they repel,
and so the polymer shrinks
and if we roll up layers
like this into a tube,
we can amplify the force they generate.
It stretches up to 25% of its length.
By cycling the voltage
hundreds of times per second,
these muscles drive the RoboBees wings.
- When you shrink down to smaller scale,
your fly wing frequency goes up higher.
So we are at the 400 hertz range.
- Which is right in between
a honeybee and a mosquito.
- Yes.
(group laughs)
- [Derek] This flexible
muscle can take bumps
and scrapes and keep working,
but if it's pierced by a needle,
the carbon nanotubes get pulled in
and then the plates touch,
causing a short circuit that
renders the muscle useless.
But the scientists have even
found a way around this.
When high current is cycled,
the carbon nanotubes that
are touching burn off
and so the muscle self-heals.
Kevin and his team even invented a process
to perform laser surgery on the robot.
- You're creating smaller defect
around a very, very big defect
and then by isolating the small defect,
you're using the small defect
to isolate the big defect.
So that was what we call
the laser-assisted clearing process.
- One robot was really
tested to its limits.
Its artificial muscle was
pierced by cactus needles
and hit by a laser beam
(laser sizzling)
and it could still fly,
but these muscles are energy intensive
and for robots at this scale
that have to be so light,
there's no room for extra batteries.
Luckily, there is another
way to get around.
- [Henry] That's a jumping, flying robot.
- [Kevin] Yeah.
(upbeat music)
- [Derek] This RoboBee
conserves energy by hopping.
This tech was used on another drone
at the City University of Hong Kong.
Normally this drone can
only fly continuously
for 6.3 minutes,
but with the hopping attachment,
it can keep moving for 50 minutes,
nearly 10 times longer.
(RoboBee buzzing)
Scientists believe this
could be even more effective
in low-gravity, low-air
resistance environments like Mars.
So it would be perfect for
an ingenuity version 2.0.
But microrobots are
already being used today.
(gentle music)
(airplane whooshing)
Every day planes complete
hundreds of thousands of flights
and most of them have
multiple turbine engines.
Now a crack in a turbine
can be catastrophic,
so manufacturers inspect
them every 3000 flight cycles
or 180 days,
but inspections cost tens
of thousands of dollars
and can take a whole day.
That's where this cockroach-inspired
robot from earlier,
HAMR, comes in.
It's incredibly fast,
it can run 10.5 body lengths per second.
Speaking in relative terms,
that's faster than a
horse, and it's versatile.
Its special foot pads can apply a voltage
to polarized metal surfaces,
creating an opposite
charge underneath its feet
and that's how it's able
to stick to metal surfaces,
similar to a balloon sticking to a wall
after you rub it on your hair.
Rolls-Royce and Harvard
are working to put HAMR
inside of engines to
inspect for turbine cracks
even upside down.
And since its mass is so small,
adhesion forces are much
stronger relative to its weight.
So HAMR can get into some tight spaces
and that can be pretty useful.
(sirens wailing)
One of the first times
that robots were deployed
in an emergency situation
was during the 9/11 search
for survivors at Ground Zero.
Unfortunately, they didn't
turn out to be that helpful.
They were big and expensive
and they'd get stuck.
Three different types inspected
eight sections of rubble,
but none found survivors.
So an ideal rescue robot
should be able to navigate tight spaces,
withstand damage and debris,
operate across varied environments,
and be inexpensive enough
to be replaced if destroyed.
- The material cost is actually quite low
for making the robot.
The human labor is high,
but in terms of the material, right,
couple of dollars per robot,
but it's really not that much.
- Really?
- Yes.
- So the idea is to deploy swarms
of insect-sized microrobots
to search for survivors in disaster zones.
(dramatic music)
(siren wailing)
But I understand when I say swarm,
you might get a little worried.
I mean, swarms of miniature killer robots
are straight out of dystopian sci-fi.
Think the hunter-seeker from "Dune"
or the killer robot bees
from "Black Mirror."
- You might be familiar
with that like famous
"Black Mirror" TV episode
where all like the bees.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
When that came out,
everybody that I had ever
met in my entire life
sent me a text message and was like,
"Hey bro, you seen this?"
- [Derek] But this
idea isn't so farfetched.
In the early 2000s, bees were dying off.
- It's called
colony collapse disorder.
- Congress is holding hearings,
even the Vice President has been briefed.
- In fact, the whole
RoboBee project started
with the goal of replacing the bees.
Thankfully that idea didn't last long.
- Bees can do much better jobs
in terms of pollination than
those robots much more cheaply.
To pollinate,
you need a huge colony of
bees to do those effectively.
Also, from an environmental
protection perspective,
I think it doesn't make sense
to replace bees with robotics bees
from a cost-effective perspective
and also from the
perspective of, you know,
if you have so much money,
why you making those bees
than protecting the real bees.
- Okay, so they won't replace the bees,
but I can still easily imagine a world
where these same robots
that are supposed to help in a disaster
are secretly being used to spy on me.
(tense music)
(robot buzzing)
I mean, it's a bug that would
literally look like a bug.
(shower water dripping)
That's terrifying.
- Is there any fear from you
about what they could be
used for, like ethically?
- We really focus on
the fundamental science
and solving the fun technical problems.
And as a society in general,
we all should think about collectively
how to prevent those new
technology from doing harm.
- But we're getting a
bit ahead of ourselves.
I mean, most of the robots we've seen
aren't able to spy on us.
In fact, they're not
even fully autonomous.
- We have offboard sensing
from those cameras,
you have offboard power from those,
and offboard computation.
What you see today is
everything is offboard.
But hopefully in five years,
then we can combine both sensing autonomy
and power autonomy,
and that's the longer-term goal.
- That's awesome.
- Harvard's RoboBee has
managed short bursts
of untethered autonomous flight.
So it's fair to say we aren't that far off
from robot insects
operating freely around us.
Still, there is a limit
to how far these robots
can go on just batteries.
Batteries need shielding
to prevent damage,
short circuits, and leaks.
And the thing is, as
batteries are scaled down,
this shielding has to stay
about the same thickness.
So that means smaller batteries
become increasingly inefficient.
And that's ignoring that
the energy-to-weight ratio
of batteries is just fundamentally lower
than that of chemical fuels.
At the insect scale,
every milligram matters.
- We just said, like let's
just sail past all of that
and just use a video game cheat code
and just power our robot
with the smallest explosions possible
and put two tiny internal
combustion engines on board it,
and it works.
(upbeat music)
(robot tapping)
And it sounds like a combustion engine,
which is probably my favorite part of it.
(robot tapping)
- [Derek] Cameron's
penny-sized engine runs
on a constant stream
of methane and oxygen.
This is fed into a chamber
where it's ignited by a spark
and so it combusts,
releasing a burst of energy.
The hot gases rapidly expand,
pushing against a
flexible polymer membrane
that acts like a piston.
- So the membrane moves as the piston
and then instead of having
to, like, have any sort
of elaborate system
that brings it back down
because it just naturally is elastic,
it sort of has its own restoring force.
That was our clever little innovation.
- As the membrane shrinks back,
it vents the exhaust gases,
allowing the cycle to repeat.
(mechanism tapping)
Despite the continuous
flow of methane and oxygen,
the fuel line never catches fire.
That's because as explosions get smaller,
their volume shrinks much
faster than their surface area.
This causes them to lose heat more quickly
to their surroundings.
In Cameron's robot,
only a small amount of
gas burns at a time,
so heat quickly escapes
into the fuel line,
cooling the gas
and stopping the flame from
traveling back up the line.
With just two of these combustion chambers
on a little robot,
one for the front legs
and one for the back,
Cameron can control its heading.
- You can actuate just
one of the two sides
at a given time if you want
because both sides are operational.
So if we spark in both
sides, it'll move straight.
But if we just do one or
the other, it'll pivot.
- [Derek] And this robot
is super powerful for its size.
- It weighs 1.6 grams,
which is about as much
as a gummy bear weighs.
(robot tapping)
It can jump like two feet
in the air approximately.
It can carry 22 times its body weight,
which is about what a cockroach
or a lot of beetles can do.
We'll be able to put
a fuel tank, you know,
microelectronics sensors,
a camera battery,
and still have weight left over to go,
and this thing will still chug along.
That's the future. That's the goal.
- Scientists have created robots
that can do what some insects do
and there are clear
applications for this work.
But for these roboticists,
these self-labeled misfits,
that's not what it's all about.
- If it's about application,
we should all like make a startup
and try to like think about what we can do
to make money, right?
We think there are nice applications,
like inspection and search and rescue,
but I would say as a research lab,
we are mostly driven by curiosity.
I think that's a very
honest answer. (laughs)
(quirky electronic music)
- So cool.
If you are someone
who designs hardware like
these robots, mini or mighty,
you know that you need to
create a CAD model first
so you can prototype and
bring your ideas to life.
But the problem with most
mainstream CAD software
is you need a very powerful
computer and a mighty budget.
That's why we reached out
to today's sponsor, Onshape.
Onshape is a modern CAD
and PDM system designed for businesses.
And unlike any other
professional CAD system,
Onshape is built entirely in the cloud,
powered by Amazon Web Services.
That means you don't need
expensive computer hardware,
it never crashes, and
you never lose your work.
It just runs in your
browser on any system,
be it Windows, Mac, Linux,
or even on your phone.
I can actually pull up that
mini robot model right now
and start moving some
of these things around.
It's also built to be collaborative
so you can work alongside friends
or colleagues like never before
on the same design in real time.
For businesses, you can
trial Onshape for six months
and for students' hobbyists,
it's completely free to use.

Onshape also uses tried
and tested Git-style
version control methods
from software design so
you don't have to worry
about sending multiple large files around
and keeping track of all
the different iterations.
It is all done for you.
None of this emailing V2 final final
for real this time one nonsense.
If you work for a government agency
or have contracts with the
government, I have good news.
