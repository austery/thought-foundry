Groner
 a
 very
 warm
 welcome
 jump
 thank


you
 for
 having
 me
 Nikolai
 and
 thank
 you


for
 your
 trust
 uh
 with
 us
 and
 our


companies
 now
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at
 exor
 as


a
 company
 exor
 is
 a
 company
 that
 builds


great
 companies
 with
 great
 people
 and


how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 we
 try
 and
 do
 that
 by


choosing
 the
 companies
 by
 committing


ourselves
 as
 owners
 of
 these
 companies


and
 aligning
 our
 ownership
 with
 the


governance
 of
 these
 companies
 and
 the


leadership
 of
 these
 companies
 you
 have


some
 other
 groups
 worldwide
 who
 is


trying
 to
 do
 the
 same
 you
 of
 course
 have


Warren
 Buffett's
 uh
 B
 Hathaway
 you
 have


the
 wenberg
 in
 Sweden
 just
 how
 would


your
 philosophy
 be
 similar
 or
 different


well
 those
 are
 very
 good
 examples
 um
 and


very
 respected
 uh
 examples
 by
 us
 and
 and


admired
 and
 both
 have
 have
 served
 as


Role
 Models
 as
 both
 of
 them
 are
 owners


of
 many
 companies
 engaged
 long-term


think
 ERS
 and
 True
 Believers
 in
 in


people
 and
 and
 Leadership
 how
 do
 you


decide
 what
 to
 buy
 we
 end
 up
 really


trying
 to
 reflect
 on
 sectors
 we're


interested
 and
 most
 recently
 healthc


care
 has
 really
 become
 the
 area
 of
 of


focus
 that
 we've
 have
 at


exor
 um
 and
 we'll
 come
 back
 to
 to
 um
 to


many
 of
 these
 companies
 but
 you
 know
 you


are
 um
 a
 really
 long-term
 um
 thinking


group
 you
 own
 the
 football
 club
 for
 100


years
 pretty
 much
 and
 uh
 few
 companies


get
 really
 old
 I
 think
 um
 you
 have


mentioned
 that
 only
 45
 out
 of
 a
 million


companies
 survive
 for
 more
 than
 a


century
 so
 why
 why
 why
 are
 you
 guys


dealing
 business
 well
 what
 you
 need


really
 to
 to
 think
 about
 is
 to
 last
 you


need
 to
 renew
 yourself
 and
 make
 sure


that
 what
 you
 do
 remains
 current
 and


your
 your
 abilities
 as
 an
 organization


as
 a
 company
 are
 ones
 that
 allow
 you
 to


make
 sure
 that
 you
 are
 as
 current
 today


as
 you
 were
 yesterday
 as
 you
 will
 be


tomorrow
 and
 there's
 that
 real
 belief


and
 fortitude
 that
 comes
 with
 it
 in
 in


trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 what
 you
 are


working
 on
 and
 what
 you're
 working
 for


is


enduring
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure
 you
 stay


current
 you
 you
 are
 always
 reminded
 in
 a


competitive
 market
 Marketplace
 about


what
 is
 happening
 by
 your
 customers
 by


your
 competitors
 and
 being
 aware
 of
 what


your
 customers
 want
 and
 and
 how
 your


competitors
 are
 actually
 behaving
 is
 is


what
 keeps
 you
 most
 alert
 on
 the
 other


hand
 what
 is
 wonderful
 is
 also
 to
 be


able
 to
 explore
 innovate
 and
 vent
 and


and
 that
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 renewing
 ones


themselves
 MH
 because
 you
 you
 are


particularly
 in
 in
 the
 industries
 in


which
 we
 operate
 and
 some
 of
 our


companies
 have
 over
 free
 centuries
 of


existence
 and
 the
 most
 recently
 one
 is


Phillips
 over
 that
 amount
 of
 time
 it
 is


also
 based
 on
 new
 things
 new
 ideas
 and


and
 inventions
 that
 become
 reality
 MH


how
 important
 is
 the
 family
 ownership


and
 family
 backing
 or
 commitment
 I
 think


that
 a
 committed
 ownership
 is
 very


important
 for
 an


organization
 uh
 it
 provides
 that


stability
 uh
 I
 believe
 that
 family


controlled
 companies
 and
 and
 within
 uh


the
 public
 markets
 are
 a
 very
 good


combination
 between
 the
 stability
 that
 a


family
 provides
 and
 the
 long-term


thinking
 but
 being
 a
 public
 company
 the


stimulus
 that
 you
 have
 by
 having


investors
 um
 John
 your
 background
 is
 is


uh
 pretty
 incredible
 you
 were
 put
 in


charge
 of
 this
 group
 when
 you
 were
 21
 22


I
 became
 a
 director
 at
 21
 in
 1997
 yeah


do
 you
 just
 want
 to
 tell
 us
 about
 uh
 how


this
 all
 came
 about
 because
 your


grandfather
 was
 uh
 you
 know
 the


legendary
 onelli
 and
 he
 kind
 of
 picked


you
 just
 how
 how
 did
 this
 come
 about
 I


always
 had
 uh
 very
 keen
 interest
 in
 um


in
 in
 learning
 and
 learning
 about
 uh


business
 and
 I
 studied
 engineering
 uh
 in


Trin
 when
 I
 was
 18
 years
 old
 I
 I
 lived


in
 multiple
 countries
 and
 as
 I
 started


uh
 studying
 I
 also
 started
 working
 and


spending
 more
 time
 with
 with
 my


grandfather
 and
 and
 and
 his
 colleagues


and
 being
 more
 and
 more
 involved
 with


the
 company
 and
 he
 felt
 uh
 in


1997
 um
 as
 we
 were
 approaching
 the


Centennial
 in
 1999
 that
 it
 was
 important


to
 have
 on
 the
 board
 uh
 a
 representation


of
 the
 younger


generation
 and
 he
 he
 appointed
 me
 as
 as


the
 choice
 of
 continuing
 the
 commitment


our
 family
 had
 with
 the
 company
 at
 21


years
 old
 which
 by
 the
 way
 was
 the
 same


age
 he
 joined
 the
 board
 of
 Fiat
 uh
 which


was
 uh
 his
 grandfather
 my
 great


great-grandfather
 the
 founder
 of
 Fiat


that
 uh
 indicated
 him
 and
 and
 I
 think


that
 it
 was
 partially
 symbolic
 to
 show


commitment
 to
 a
 company
 that
 was
 turning


a
 100
 years
 and
 in
 preparation
 for
 its


Next
 Century
 but
 but
 also
 a
 great


opportunity
 that
 he
 wanted
 to
 give
 me
 as


he
 was
 observing
 that
 I
 had
 a
 keen


interest
 in
 in
 learning
 and
 his
 advice


which
 remains
 true
 to
 to
 this
 day
 was
 no


one's
 going
 to
 expect
 nothing
 from
 you


the
 important
 thing
 is
 for
 you
 to
 learn


to
 listen
 and
 to
 ask
 questions
 what
 did


he
 see
 in
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 were
 the


traits
 that
 he
 admired
 in
 you
 I
 think


that
 um
 my
 my


grandfather
 uh
 was
 was
 someone
 who


believed
 in
 uh
 in
 Freedom
 and
 that
 you


can't
 force
 people
 in
 choices
 but
 you


need
 to
 enable
 them
 in
 making
 sure
 that


they
 can
 uh
 work
 to
 what
 their


aspirations
 are
 and
 he
 generally
 felt
 as


as
 also
 the
 envir
 his
 working


environment
 uh
 that
 I
 I
 had
 real


interest
 and
 real
 curiosity
 so
 that
 that


is
 really
 at
 that
 point
 what
 he
 seen
 he


was
 seeing
 and
 commitment
 I
 was
 studying


and
 I
 was
 also
 working
 um
 and
 I
 was


doing
 that
 because
 I
 truly
 enjoyed
 it


not
 because
 it
 was
 forced
 on
 me
 and
 the


combination
 of
 those
 two
 were
 were
 were


the
 definitely
 at
 that
 point
 um
 because


at
 21
 years
 old
 you
 you
 cannot
 say


you've
 achieved
 much
 you're
 now
 the


biggest
 employer
 in
 Italy
 right
 you
 have


400,000
 people
 working
 in
 your
 group
 how


does
 that
 feel
 like
 a
 21y
 old
 to
 be


given
 that
 type
 of


responsibility
 or
 or
 to
 know
 that
 you


will
 get
 the
 responsibility
 at
 some


stage
 responsibility
 is
 is
 something


that
 you
 have
 yeah
 and
 uh
 I
 I've


personally
 always
 felt
 responsible
 felt


responsible
 um
 since
 a
 very
 very
 early


age
 um
 as
 we
 we
 were
 growing
 up
 in
 many


different
 countries
 and
 we
 had
 divorced


parents
 and
 was
 very
 much
 very
 close
 to


to
 my
 siblings
 and
 always
 tried
 to
 be


responsible
 uh
 in
 in
 school
 settings


Sports
 settings
 uh
 and
 taking
 on
 taking


on
 responsibility
 was
 definitely


something
 that
 uh
 I
 I
 always
 uh
 was


drawn
 to
 one
 of
 the
 values
 we
 have
 at


exor
 is
 courage
 and
 responsibility
 and


difficulties
 are
 the
 moments
 in
 which


you
 can
 show
 courage
 and
 you
 can
 show


responsibility
 for
 for
 others
 and
 over


the
 course
 of
 the
 more
 than
 20
 20
 CL


getting
 close
 to
 30
 years
 uh
 that
 I'm


I've
 been
 involved
 as
 as
 a
 director
 of


fied
 back
 in
 1997
 there
 have
 been
 many


moments
 of
 time
 uh
 where
 that


responsibility
 uh
 was
 was
 acted
 on
 how


do
 they
 prepare
 you
 for
 taking
 on
 that


responsibility
 what
 do
 they
 what
 kind
 of


things
 do
 they
 expose
 you


to
 who
 do
 they
 introduce
 you
 to
 my


grandfather
 he
 would
 take
 me
 and
 also
 my


my
 brother
 and
 my
 sister
 we
 we
 would
 be


exposed
 to
 his
 life
 and
 to
 people
 he


would
 be
 to
 he
 would
 be
 meeting
 uh
 what


he
 liked
 to
 do
 is
 he'd
 have
 these
 phone


calls
 which
 were
 professional
 work
 rated


phone
 calls
 and
 we'd
 spend
 time
 with
 him


as
 we
 were
 speaking
 then
 he'd
 take
 a


phone
 call
 and
 he
 have
 that
 phone
 call


but
 we
 couldn't
 really
 listen
 to
 what


the
 other
 person
 was
 saying
 so
 we
 had
 to


guess
 and
 then
 somehow
 we
 had
 these


conversations
 after
 about
 what
 actually


the
 other
 person
 was
 saying
 what
 type
 of


people
 did
 he
 speak
 to
 it
 would
 be


colleagues
 of
 his
 would
 be
 business


partner


would
 be
 uh
 would
 be
 different
 different


persons
 with
 whom
 he
 he
 was
 uh
 working


um
 and
 and
 that
 definitely
 was
 a
 a
 very


formative


way
 my
 family
 uh
 my
 grandfather
 were
 not


imposing
 any
 form
 of
 apprentice


apprenticeship
 uh
 that
 was
 more


something
 I
 ended
 up
 uh
 wanting
 which
 is


why
 I
 I
 started
 uh
 while
 I
 was
 studying


apprenticeships
 and
 you
 mentioned


yourself
 people
 like
 Sergio
 maon
 which


is
 who's
 you
 know
 the
 phenomenal
 CEO
 in


Italy
 so
 who
 have
 been
 the
 really


instrumental
 people
 in
 forming
 you
 as
 a


leader
 and
 thinker
 I
 was
 incredibly


fortunate
 to
 have
 uh
 many
 people
 uh
 whom


I
 worked
 with
 had
 wisdom
 and


experiences
 um
 my
 grandfather's


colleagues
 um
 John
 Luigi
 gabetti
 with


whom
 he
 worked
 for
 many
 decades
 Serio


with
 whom
 I
 worked
 for
 14
 years
 and
 and


many
 many
 of
 my
 colleagues
 have
 been
 uh


incredible
 particularly
 as
 as
 I
 started


relatively
 young
 uh
 I
 was
 very
 fortunate


to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 at
 a
 young
 age
 with


people
 who
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 experience
 I


will
 also
 say
 that
 I've
 always
 been
 uh


trying
 to
 to
 learn
 uh
 from
 from
 others


and
 spend
 time
 uh
 studying
 what
 other


family
 controlled
 companies
 did
 and
 know


the
 examples
 you
 men
 you
 mentioned
 of


Burkshire
 hatway
 or
 investor
 have
 been


role
 models
 and
 I
 was
 very
 fortunate
 to


spend
 time
 with
 uh
 Mr
 Buffett
 in
 Omaha


or
 with
 the
 wenberg
 family
 in
 Stockholm


and
 and
 by
 asking
 and
 and
 also
 really


genuinely
 uh
 being
 interested
 in
 in


trying
 to
 see
 what
 that
 could
 apply
 to


us
 and
 and
 equally
 also
 within
 the


entrepreneurial
 world
 or
 the
 investment


world
 uh
 my
 my
 life
 has
 allowed
 me
 to
 be


able
 to
 interact
 with
 with
 many
 people


who
 have
 who
 have
 been
 very
 helpful
 in


in
 helping
 us
 become
 what
 what
 are
 at


the
 same
 time
 you
 mentioned
 to
 me
 that


you
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 reset
 as
 well
 right


you
 want
 to
 have
 a
 clean
 slate
 you
 are


you
 know
 the
 new
 start
 of
 a
 new
 uh


generation
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 that
 reset
 in
 our
 case
 the
 reset


was
 imposed
 Nikolai
 it
 was
 imposed


because
 when
 when
 I
 came
 uh
 and
 got
 more


involved
 which
 was
 in
 2003


2004
 uh
 my
 grandfather
 passed
 away
 in


2003
 my
 great
 uncle
 passed
 away
 in
 2004


at
 that
 point
 uh
 I
 was
 in
 effect


representing
 my
 family
 in
 in
 our


business
 uh
 and
 those
 were
 times
 of
 big


trouble
 and
 when
 you
 are
 going
 through


those
 circumstances
 you
 forced
 into


decisions
 how
 dire
 was
 the
 situation


when
 you
 took
 over
 incredibly
 dire
 I


mean
 if
 you
 look
 between
 the
 financial


and
 operational
 difficulties
 that
 the


company
 was
 facing
 back
 then
 the


likelihood
 of
 us
 not
 making
 it
 were


extremely
 high
 so
 what
 did
 you
 do
 we


were
 because
 you
 you
 you
 you
 talk
 about


the
 different
 faces
 that
 you've
 been


through
 in
 EXO
 after
 you
 took
 over
 so


what
 what's
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 do
 you


come
 into
 that
 situation
 it
 doesn't
 look


great
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 do
 we
 we
 ended
 up


uh
 as
 a
 family
 uh
 investing
 in
 the


company
 so
 we
 committed
 Capital
 which


strengthened
 the
 balance
 sheet
 and


renegotiated
 with
 with
 the
 banks
 that


allowed
 us
 to
 have
 Headroom
 we
 were


fortunate
 to
 appoint
 Sergio
 after
 having


appointed
 four
 different
 cosos
 before


within
 those
 two
 years
 who
 did
 not
 work


and


Sergio
 gave
 the
 company
 a
 a
 complete


projection
 uh
 with
 a
 turnaround
 we


worked
 on
 and
 the
 moment
 in
 which
 we


launched
 the
 Fiat
 500
 in
 2007
 which
 is


50
 years
 after
 it
 had
 launched
 being
 the


first
 time
 was
 really
 a
 moment
 of
 uh


where
 where
 we
 felt
 the
 company
 was
 was


actually


flourishing
 and
 that
 was
 just
 when
 the


financial
 crisis
 was
 going
 to
 hit
 and


and
 then
 we
 had
 the
 financial
 crisis
 and


the
 financial
 crisis
 led
 us
 to
 America


where
 we
 got
 involved
 with


kryer
 and
 and
 kryer
 allowed
 to
 create


Fiat
 kryer
 and
 also
 to
 start
 separating


the
 different
 companies
 of
 the
 Fiat


group
 who
 today
 are
 cnh
 which
 is
 a


global
 leader
 in
 agriculture
 equipment


IO
 one
 of
 the
 leaders
 in
 trucks
 and


commercial
 vehicles
 and
 Ferrari
 which


had
 a
 very
 different
 Destiny
 in
 terms
 of


what
 it
 did
 versus
 a
 large
 car
 company


in
 the
 midst
 of
 that
 we
 also
 simplified


the
 group
 and
 we
 had
 different
 holding


companies
 which
 we
 merged
 into
 one
 which


was
 exor
 and
 we
 also
 started
 rethinking


what
 we
 owned
 in
 trying
 to
 own
 less


companies
 but
 more
 of
 these
 companies
 so


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 decades
 and
 the


first
 decade
 was
 really
 survival
 the


second
 decade
 was
 stability
 and
 and
 and


really
 trying
 to
 find
 the
 the
 right


construct
 and
 the
 third
 decade
 which
 is


the
 one
 we're
 in
 is
 the
 decade
 where
 we


have
 been
 able
 to
 grow
 well
 an


incredible
 U
 development
 um
 since
 you


took
 over
 now
 when
 um
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the


group
 uh
 you
 have
 really
 really
 strong


companies
 with
 strong
 Brands
 so
 when


what
 what
 kind
 of
 ties
 them
 together


what
 do
 you
 think
 they
 have
 in
 common


these
 companies
 the
 defining
 commonality


of
 these
 companies
 is
 really
 through
 our


ownership
 uh
 and
 we
 believe
 very
 much


that
 the
 most
 effective
 uh
 way
 in
 which


you
 can
 manage
 a
 company
 is
 a
 Founder


let
 company
 and
 and
 that
 combines
 the


ownership
 the
 governance
 and
 the


leadership
 and
 we
 we
 have
 tried
 within


our
 companies
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that


Clarity
 of
 of
 purpose
 is
 very
 much
 felt


within
 all
 the
 companies
 in
 which
 we
 are


we
 are
 involved
 now
 you
 put
 great
 CEOs


in
 place
 what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 define
 a


great
 CEO
 I
 I've
 been
 very
 lucky
 to
 work


and
 and
 and
 be
 working
 with
 great
 cosos


and
 um
 for
 me
 a
 great
 Co
 is
 someone


who's
 really
 interested
 in
 the
 job
 and


not
 the
 title
 MH
 and
 who's
 really


interested
 in
 competing
 in
 the
 pure


sense
 of
 what
 it
 means
 and
 and
 really


likes
 likes
 not
 only
 the
 company
 but


likes
 the
 people
 with
 with
 whom
 he
 he


works
 uh
 a
 a
 great
 CEO
 is
 also
 someone


who
 has
 the
 ability
 of


thinking
 longterm
 but
 also
 acting
 uh
 now


being
 strategic
 but
 yet
 being


operational
 how
 do
 you
 find
 them
 one
 of


our
 values
 that
 defined
 for
 me
 well
 uh


the
 leaders
 with
 whom
 we
 work
 is


ambition
 and


humility
 and
 in
 some
 ways
 I
 feel
 culture


self-
 select
 and


the
 the
 the
 ground
 in
 which
 and
 the


environment
 in
 which
 we
 we
 operate
 is
 is


one
 that
 self
 selects
 uh
 the
 the
 leaders


that
 our
 companies
 have
 and
 the
 the


opportunity
 have
 have
 really
 been
 that


when
 you
 work
 with
 someone
 very
 good


Sergio
 uh
 was
 leading
 uh
 SGS
 which
 was


one
 of
 our
 companies
 and
 then
 the


opportunity
 of
 taking
 over
 Fiat


presented
 himself
 more
 recently
 uh


Garrett
 uh
 was
 running
 IO
 and
 he's
 now


been
 appointed
 to
 run


cnh
 and
 and
 I
 feel
 that
 having
 the


abilities
 of
 of
 creating
 also


opportunities
 for
 talented
 leaders
 that


we
 work
 with
 is
 has
 been
 one
 in
 in
 which


we
 have
 uh
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 progress
 some


grow
 up
 in
 the
 companies
 some
 come
 from


outside
 uh
 benedetto
 uh
 whom
 you


interviewed
 Nikolai
 who's
 running


Ferrari
 came
 from
 a
 different
 industry


from
 a
 different
 world
 yeah
 uh
 I
 was


acting
 CEO
 of
 Ferrari
 for
 a
 year
 and
 and


clearly
 uh
 clearly
 understood
 that
 ferar


needed
 not
 someone
 from
 the
 car
 industry


not
 someone
 from
 the
 luxury
 industry
 and


Benedito
 has
 given
 Ferrari
 with
 with
 his


enthusiasm
 and
 and
 also
 his
 experience


uh
 something
 that
 was
 very
 needed
 for


the
 company
 to
 look
 at
 building


something
 new
 for
 this
 Century
 you
 also


pay
 um
 your
 people
 very
 well
 and
 uh
 uh


as
 you
 know
 we
 have
 voted
 against
 the


pay
 package
 at
 stantis
 you
 know
 the
 car


uh
 group
 because
 we
 think
 uh
 we
 think


the
 pay
 package


is
 is
 not
 correctly
 aligned
 with
 with


our
 interest
 um
 just
 how
 do
 you
 look
 at


executive
 pay
 is
 there
 such
 a
 thing
 as


too
 high
 a
 pay
 package
 for
 you
 I
 believe


that
 if
 if
 you
 are
 a
 high
 performing


company
 which
 is
 what
 we
 aspire
 to
 be


and
 if
 you
 compete
 within
 a
 competitive


Marketplace
 to


win
 uh
 what
 we
 believe
 is
 that
 we
 need


to
 align
 our


compensation
 with
 what
 our
 objectives


are
 M
 and
 our
 compensations


are
 variable
 compensations
 and
 these


compensations
 are
 completely
 align
 with


results
 so
 if
 we
 win
 as
 a
 company


everyone
 who
 works
 in
 the
 company
 from


the
 co
 to
 all
 all
 the
 different


participants
 in
 the
 company
 are
 ones


that
 benefit
 from
 it
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


2023
 where
 results
 of
 our
 companies
 have


been
 good
 the
 the
 overall


compensation
 the
 variable
 compensation


has
 been
 very
 rewarding
 for
 everyone
 so


we
 believe
 that
 what
 is
 important
 is
 to


be
 clear
 with
 your
 objectives
 in
 the
 way


you
 compensate
 which
 is
 what
 we
 feel
 we


are
 what
 we
 also
 um
 observe
 is
 in
 some


ways
 the
 better
 you
 do
 the
 more


compensated
 you
 are
 and
 so
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 debates
 about
 the
 quantums
 yeah


but
 in
 some
 ways
 we
 believe
 that
 if
 the


quantums
 are
 high
 as
 it's
 a
 variable
 pay


that
 is
 a
 reflection
 that
 the
 results


are
 there
 yeah
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we
 also


think
 it's
 important
 that
 we
 have
 an


alignment
 and
 that
 alignment
 is
 a
 medium


long-term
 alignment
 M
 and
 we
 expect
 not


only
 the
 executives
 the
 leadership
 of


our
 companies
 to
 own
 shares
 within
 our


companies
 but
 we
 also
 believe
 that
 if
 we


can
 have
 a
 broader
 based
 ownership
 which


is
 what
 we
 have
 been
 doing
 in
 our


companies
 it
 is
 really
 important
 to
 have


that
 that
 alignment
 well
 as
 you
 know
 we


are
 very
 transparent
 about
 these
 things


and
 and
 the
 important
 thing
 for
 us
 is


that
 the
 uh
 the
 packages
 are
 long-term


they
 are
 Equity
 based
 they
 are
 result


based
 um
 and
 and
 not
 kind
 of
 to
 stand


out
 from
 industry
 um
 standards
 so
 we'll


so
 so
 you
 may
 continue
 to
 get
 over


against
 vote
 on
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 but


uh
 but
 we
 we
 are
 grown
 up
 people
 but
 I


think
 Nikolai
 that's
 exactly
 aligned
 uh


with
 us
 you
 are
 100%
 aligned
 the


difference
 is
 we
 would
 do
 more
 than


industry
 standards
 because
 we
 feel
 that


if
 you
 overperform
 within
 your
 industry


you
 should
 also
 be


overcompensated
 talking
 about
 um
 uh
 full


speed
 here
 Ferrari
 I
 see
 when
 you
 talk


about
 Ferrari
 you
 know
 you
 you
 you
 smile


differently
 from
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 other


companies
 we
 talk
 about
 here
 so
 what's


so
 special
 with
 Ferrari
 Ferrari
 is
 uh
 is


about
 passion
 uh
 Ferrar
 is
 about
 uh


being
 able
 in
 the
 free
 Souls
 that
 the


company
 has
 is
 it
 a
 car
 company
 Ferrari


is
 not
 a
 car
 company
 what
 is
 it
 Ferrari


is
 a
 a
 very
 special
 company
 so
 it's


beyond
 great
 it's
 beyond
 a
 great
 company


it's
 a
 special
 company
 and
 it
 roots
 in


racing
 a
 very
 strong
 the
 sports
 cars


that
 it
 does
 are


incredible
 and
 the
 opening
 up
 to
 all


different
 areas
 within


lifestyle
 is
 is
 giving
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities
 to
 many
 people
 to
 be
 able


to
 have
 Ferrari
 in
 their
 lives
 uh
 not


necessarily
 all
 of
 them
 being
 able
 to


have
 one
 of
 our
 cars
 what
 does
 Ferrari


mean
 to
 an
 Italian
 ferar


is
 is
 press
 of
 what
 uh
 our
 country
 can


achieve
 and
 also
 a
 demonstration
 that
 uh


we
 are
 a
 country
 of
 incredible
 abilities


in


genosity
 and
 there
 is
 a
 competitive


Spirit
 also
 uh
 within
 the
 the
 uh
 the


racing
 world
 uh
 we
 won
 in
 Monaco
 uh
 just


a
 week
 ago
 uh
 with
 SH
 Clair
 who
 is
 from


Monaco
 winning
 the
 first
 time
 in
 in
 his


country
 and
 Monaco
 is
 a
 really
 important


race
 and
 those
 are
 moments
 of
 incredible


Joy
 now
 you
 are
 launching
 your
 first


electric
 car
 next
 year
 and
 I
 tried
 to


get
 you
 to
 show
 me
 a
 picture
 which
 you


didn't
 want
 to
 I
 think
 you
 needed
 to


kill
 me
 afterwards
 if
 you
 did
 but
 uh


what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 look
 like
 it's
 going


to
 look
 like
 nothing
 you
 would
 expect
 it


to
 look
 like
 right
 and
 for
 us
 the


electric
 car
 is
 a
 white
 canvas
 which


allows
 us
 to
 use
 new
 technologies
 from


the
 electric
 and
 the
 electronic
 world


and
 to
 really
 be
 able
 to
 create
 and


design
 a
 car
 which
 is
 very
 different
 and


that
 is
 incredibly
 exciting
 and
 I
 think


the
 the


industry
 as
 of
 now
 has
 not
 yet
 explored


the
 realm
 of
 possible
 that
 these
 new


technologies
 can
 can
 provide
 us
 have
 you


driven
 it
 yet
 I
 have
 tried
 it
 yes
 what


does
 it
 feel
 like
 it's
 incredible
 in


what
 way
 in
 all
 ways
 if
 you
 like
 to


drive
 the
 Frills
 And
 the
 emotions
 that


you
 will
 have
 on
 this
 car
 are
 just


exceptional
 does
 it
 have
 a
 sound
 it
 it


has
 a
 sound
 it
 will
 have
 a
 sound
 which


that
 is
 even
 more
 precious
 to
 listen


than
 the
 pictures
 I
 didn't
 show


you
 so
 tell
 me
 you
 sat
 inside
 the
 car


what
 did
 you
 experience
 it's
 a
 very


different
 uh


experience
 um
 and
 and
 what
 we
 are
 trying


to
 do
 Nikolai
 is
 to
 give
 the
 opportunity


at
 Ferrari
 to
 really
 take
 the
 most


Advantage
 we
 can
 and
 the


spaces
 particularly
 as
 you
 think
 about


more
 space
 that
 you
 can
 obtain
 is
 is


going
 to
 be
 special
 I
 can
 tell
 you


different
 special
 and
 Incredibly


incredibly
 fun
 to
 to
 actually
 drive
 you


have
 not
 Johnny
 Ives
 uh
 also
 working


with
 you
 at
 Ferrari
 who
 was
 the
 famous


Apple
 designer
 what
 does
 he
 contribute


Johnny
 IV
 and
 Mark
 new
 uh
 and
 have


created
 love
 from
 which
 is
 a
 creative


Collective
 yeah
 and
 we
 we
 are
 at
 Ferrar


a
 very
 creative
 company
 and
 design
 is


very
 important
 and
 there's


always
 uh
 there's
 always
 dialogues


between
 design
 engineering
 and
 Fin


you
 all
 always
 need
 to
 make
 the
 numbers


work
 as
 you
 well
 know
 Nikolai
 and
 the


the
 contribution
 of
 Johnny
 and
 mark
 is


really
 been
 incredibly
 positive
 because


they've
 taught
 us
 other
 ways
 of
 thinking


they've
 taught
 us
 other
 understanding
 of


not
 only
 Hardware
 but
 also
 software
 and


as
 the
 architect
 of
 the
 Apple
 watch


which
 has
 been
 as
 of
 now
 the
 most


successful
 example
 of
 what
 is
 a


traditional
 mechanical
 analog
 product


into
 an
 electronic
 and
 digital
 one
 all


of
 that
 has
 been
 very
 very
 important
 as


we
 think
 and
 we
 frame
 uh
 our
 our
 actions


toward
 building
 this
 car
 all
 together


and
 also
 working
 together
 working
 with


them
 in
 California
 uh
 Us
 in
 maranelo
 the


exchange
 we've
 had
 the


discussions
 the
 dreams
 of
 what
 we
 wanted


to
 do
 but
 then
 we
 can't
 do
 uh
 it
 has


been
 a
 very
 invigorating
 experience
 and


one
 that
 gives
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 optimism


and
 courage
 to
 to
 Ferrari
 as
 we
 think
 at


our
 future
 that
 won't
 only
 be
 with
 our


great
 combustion
 engines
 and
 12


cylinders
 are
 hybrid
 engines
 that
 exist


today
 uh
 not
 only
 in
 in
 the
 racing
 with


our
 V6
 hybrid
 but
 also
 in
 our
 sports


cars
 and
 the
 electric
 cars
 that's
 is


going
 to
 be
 uh
 starting
 its
 unveil
 in


2025
 some
 of
 the
 other
 car
 brands
 you've


um
 grouped
 together
 in
 stantis
 so
 that's


P
 Fiat
 uh
 and
 so
 on
 what
 are
 you
 working


on
 here
 stantis
 has
 uh
 14
 and
 now
 15


brands
 with
 with
 leap
 Motors
 uh
 which
 we


recently
 announced
 which
 is
 our
 fully


electric
 car
 company
 in
 China
 we're


working
 very
 hard
 stantis
 is
 very


committed
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 cost


competitive
 at
 scale
 in
 electric


vehicles
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 get
 there
 I


mean
 is
 it
 possible
 to
 beat
 the
 Chinese


in
 EV
 I
 think
 we're
 getting
 there
 and
 I


think
 it's
 a
 very
 exciting
 Challenge
 and


we
 we
 also
 believe
 that
 with
 with
 Le


Motors
 we
 are
 also
 now
 within
 the


Chinese
 electric
 vehicle
 which
 by
 the


way
 is
 the
 electric
 vehicle
 Market
 more


than
 two-thirds
 of
 the
 electric
 vehicle


company
 uh
 cars
 have
 been
 sold
 in
 China


in
 2023


and
 even
 more
 have
 been
 built
 in
 in


China
 can
 the
 Europeans
 compete
 in


Battery
 Technology
 I
 think
 the
 Europeans


have
 to
 compete
 and
 the
 way
 in
 which
 the


car
 is
 is
 composed
 is
 of
 many
 different


uh
 components
 of
 which
 also
 batteries


who
 is
 going
 to
 do
 well
 in
 Europe
 on
 the


battery
 side
 ba
 B
 batteries
 are
 an


important
 component
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most


uh
 expensive
 one
 so
 the
 the
 importance


is
 really
 to
 try
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 as


you
 develop
 these
 new
 technologies
 both


in
 chemistry
 and
 and
 and
 actually
 in
 in


assembling
 these
 batteries
 you're
 able


to
 find
 cost
 competitive
 uh
 Solutions
 I


believe
 that
 there
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


very
 broad
 um
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very


broad


offering
 uh
 stellantis
 has
 ACC
 which
 is


a
 joint
 venture
 with
 total
 energy
 and


Mercedes
 which
 is
 building
 batteries
 in


Europe
 in
 Germany
 in
 France
 and
 in
 Italy


and
 we
 have
 strong
 Partnerships
 with
 LG


and
 Samsung
 in
 North
 America
 so
 we
 think


it's
 important
 in
 this
 stage
 for
 an
 oem


to
 have
 access
 to
 batteries
 that
 they


control
 in
 addition
 that
 than
 to
 the


ones
 that
 that
 they
 buy
 I
 feel
 that


building
 an
 electric
 car
 is
 more
 than


the
 battery
 and
 that's
 where
 a
 lot
 of


the
 concentration
 should
 be
 going
 both


in
 terms
 of


engineering


manufacturing
 and
 the
 overall
 product
 is


is
 one
 that
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 with


great
 excitement
 the
 Fiat
 500
 electric


which
 is
 built
 in
 in
 chin
 has
 been


incredibly
 successful
 smaller
 cars
 like


the
 Citroen
 Ami
 uh
 the
 the
 Topolino
 fat


poino
 which
 is
 a
 two-seater
 which
 you


can
 drive
 in
 urban
 centers
 is
 is
 very


very
 successful
 and
 if
 we
 think
 about


the
 muscle
 car
 that
 we
 historically
 have


with
 with
 our
 Dodge
 brand
 uh
 that
 are


also
 going
 electric
 that
 was
 a
 big


demonstration
 of
 what
 we
 can
 do
 in
 terms


of
 our
 range
 of
 Brands
 what
 do
 you
 drive


I
 drive
 the
 Fiat
 500
 electric
 um
 that


that's
 a
 car
 that
 I
 enjoy
 driving
 I
 also


have
 a
 bigger
 car
 which
 is
 a
 Jeep
 uh


which
 is
 a
 Jeep
 Grand


vager
 and
 I
 luckily
 I
 also
 have
 the


opportunity
 with
 my
 wife
 to
 drive
 nice


cars
 like
 Ferraris
 or
 alfha


Romeos
 and
 Maseratis
 well
 um
 good
 for


you
 um
 now
 um
 um
 staying
 in
 the
 fast


line
 here
 you
 also
 have
 a
 football
 club


so
 Juventus
 you
 owned
 for
 100
 years
 why


why
 do
 you
 own
 a
 football
 club
 Juventus


was
 uh
 acquired
 by
 my


great-grandfather
 uh
 and
 he
 was
 very


passionate
 about
 football
 very


passionate
 about
 his
 community
 and
 and


he
 felt
 it
 was
 important
 to
 uh
 and
 and


he
 he
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 uh
 with
 with


Juventus
 and
 in
 the
 30s
 uh
 there
 was
 an


historical
 moment
 where
 Juventus
 won


five
 championships
 in
 a
 row
 with
 an


incredible
 team
 which
 is
 when
 my


grandfather
 was
 young
 and
 and
 he
 got
 got


incredibly
 passionate
 by
 football
 so


football
 has
 been
 a
 true
 passion
 uh
 that


we've
 had
 a
 responsibility
 that
 we've


had
 as
 a
 family
 for
 more
 than
 a
 100


years
 and
 a
 passion
 that
 my
 family


shares
 with
 the
 many
 families
 that
 love


Juventus
 do
 you
 go
 to
 all
 the
 matches
 I


go
 to
 many
 matches
 and
 my
 my
 children


were
 very
 fortunate
 to
 grow
 up
 in
 a


period
 where
 Juventus
 won
 nine


championships
 in
 a
 row


so
 as
 my
 grandfather
 they
 actually
 ended


up
 growing
 up
 with
 Juventus
 uh
 having


extraordinary
 results
 so
 they're


incredibly
 passionate
 do
 you
 learn


anything
 from
 um
 running
 a
 football
 club


that
 you
 can
 apply
 in
 all
 the
 parts
 of


the
 business
 a
 football
 club
 is
 is
 made


of
 people
 a
 football
 club
 is
 made
 of


competing
 a
 football
 club
 is
 made
 of


resources
 that
 are
 limited
 and
 that
 you


need
 to
 try
 and
 and
 use
 in
 the
 best
 way


there
 are
 many
 leadership
 uh
 traits
 that


Sports
 and
 particularly
 football
 club


have
 and
 so
 as
 as
 our


companies
 aspire
 to
 be
 high
 performing


companies
 you
 definitely


learn
 in
 in
 high
 performing
 environments


like
 like
 professional
 sport
 is
 John
 you


are
 less
 represented
 in
 some
 of
 the


high-tech
 Industries
 and
 it
 Ai
 and
 so
 on


in
 terms
 of
 direct
 Investments
 but
 I
 but


I
 gather
 you
 are
 investing
 through
 uh


Venture
 Capital
 systems
 so
 I
 I
 studied


engineering
 um
 and
 when
 I
 was
 studying


engineering
 Internet
 and
 mobile
 were


their
 nence
 Technologies
 and
 I
 actually


uh
 among
 the
 other
 things
 I
 I
 did
 during


those
 years
 I
 also
 founded
 a
 a
 company
 a


startup
 back
 then
 which
 was
 a
 portal
 so


I've
 always
 been
 very
 uh
 inclined
 and
 a


tune
 with
 Innovation
 and
 and
 technology


and
 we
 we
 we
 actually
 are
 in
 involved


directly
 in
 in
 investing
 we
 have
 over


100
 companies
 uh
 particularly
 within
 the


fields
 of
 our
 interest
 like
 mobility
 and


Healthcare
 and
 we
 also
 host
 the
 largest


Tech
 Conference
 in
 Italy
 Italian
 Tech


week
 and
 we
 have
 now
 a
 program
 which


we're
 very
 proud
 of
 which
 is
 called


vental
 and
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 really
 help


with
 seed
 money
 any
 Italian
 entrepreneur


or
 any
 Italian
 company
 within
 the
 early


stage
 space
 and
 have
 become
 the
 larg


investor
 within
 that
 area
 and
 it's
 very


promising
 so
 you
 give
 them
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of


money
 and
 see
 how
 he
 goes
 and
 then
 what


you
 do
 and
 we
 also
 have
 a
 specific


program
 which
 we
 learned
 from
 why


combinator
 and
 others
 which
 is
 Sam


oldman's
 which
 is
 set
 yes
 and
 was
 Sam's


uh
 setup
 and
 we
 and
 we
 have
 different


batches
 of
 uh
 to
 be
 Founders
 and
 we
 we


go
 through
 that
 and
 and
 it's
 a
 very


rigorous
 process
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 good


good
 team
 that
 is
 doing
 that
 in
 chin
 and


I
 was
 with
 them
 just
 a
 couple
 of
 uh


actually
 last
 week
 and
 it's
 very
 uh
 very


promising
 uh
 every
 every
 year
 there


there
 is
 more
 courage
 to
 really
 innovate


and
 there's
 more
 courage
 to
 want
 to


actually
 build
 companies
 based
 on
 on


Technologies
 and
 do
 you
 do
 this
 because


you
 want
 uh
 you
 want
 Italy
 to
 be
 uh
 to


be
 great
 or
 you
 do
 it
 because
 you
 think


it's
 good
 business
 we
 we
 do
 our


contribution
 with
 vento
 and
 Italian
 Tech


week
 because
 we
 fundamentally
 believe


that
 a
 country
 needs
 a
 future
 despite


its
 great
 past
 and
 we
 believe
 that


that's
 a
 very
 effective
 way
 in


stimulating
 that
 future
 which
 goes


alongside
 the
 work
 we
 do
 on


philanthropies
 particularly
 with
 our


foundation
 on
 education
 where
 we
 provide


many
 different
 programs
 around
 education


starting
 at
 schools
 with
 uh
 maths
 and


physics
 and
 and
 around
 all
 the
 different


stages
 uh
 within
 within
 education
 on
 the


other
 hand
 we
 also
 think
 that
 it's


important
 not
 only
 to


transform
 and
 and
 to
 renew
 19th
 century


companies
 uh
 within
 uh
 within
 old


Industries
 but
 also
 to
 start
 21st


century
 companies
 and
 and
 that's


something
 which
 uh
 we
 we
 are
 very
 keen


in
 doing
 and
 and
 working
 with
 with

 R
 preneurs
 who
 really
 believe


that
 our
 our
 purpose
 of
 building
 great


companies
 with
 great
 people
 and
 our


values
 are
 very
 aligned
 with
 what
 they


they're
 trying
 to
 do
 you
 increasingly


are
 also
 active
 in
 the
 in
 the
 healthcare


space
 and
 you
 bought
 um
 a
 big
 stake
 in


in
 Phillips
 how
 did
 that
 come
 about
 we


we
 believe
 Healthcare
 is
 is
 a
 critical


industry
 and
 we've
 become
 much


more
 much
 more
 aware
 of
 it
 after
 what
 we


live
 through
 during
 the
 pandemic
 and
 how


how
 frail
 we
 are
 as
 humans
 and
 and
 how


healthare
 is
 so
 important
 to
 be
 able
 to


sustain
 us
 in
 the
 future
 and


particularly
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


increasing
 cost
 that
 that
 we
 have
 in


providing
 the
 right
 healthare
 we
 believe


that
 these
 problems
 are
 going
 to
 require


Solutions
 and
 we've
 been
 focusing
 very


much
 within
 the
 enablers
 and
 we
 believe


that
 Phillips
 is
 an
 extraordinary


company
 in
 really
 addressing


those
 those
 issues
 and
 Phillips
 is
 a


company
 that
 has
 an
 incredible
 history


so
 we
 were
 very
 taken
 by
 it
 history
 and


also
 one
 that
 is
 in
 in
 in
 a
 phase
 of


really
 renewing
 itself
 with
 the
 focus
 it


has
 had
 over
 the
 last
 decade
 in


healthcare
 and
 technology
 and
 it's
 a


very
 determined
 and
 ambitious
 company
 in


solving
 important
 factors
 so
 we
 we
 truly


believe
 that
 Healthcare
 is
 not
 only
 a


place
 where
 we
 do
 think
 there
 is
 a
 big


impact
 one
 can
 have
 but
 we
 also
 believe


that
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


solutions
 that
 ultimately
 will
 result
 in


good
 commercial


applications
 tell
 me
 about
 your
 interest


in
 sailing
 I
 uh
 you
 know
 you've
 had
 a


monoh
 hole
 with
 Maserati
 again
 you're


now
 doing
 a
 a
 a
 Ferrari
 project
 within


the
 sailing
 area
 what
 what
 is
 that
 going


to
 look
 like
 um
 we
 we
 we
 announced
 that


we
 were
 going
 to
 do
 a
 a
 Ferrari
 boat
 and


it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 boat
 uh
 that
 would


not
 have
 an
 engine
 and
 uh
 it
 it
 it
 was


really
 important
 uh
 for
 us
 to
 do
 a
 an


internal
 project
 uh
 where
 we
 could
 use


our
 capabilities
 in
 aerodynamics
 and


also
 looking
 at
 how
 we
 can
 fly
 because


the
 the
 new
 boats
 that
 that
 are
 coming


up
 are
 all
 with
 foils
 and
 also
 creating


a
 spirit
 of
 competition
 joanni
 soini


with
 whom
 uh
 I've
 worked
 over
 the
 last


decade
 with
 a
 mono
 then
 a
 multi-
 and
 now


with
 with
 this
 new
 project
 is
 someone


who
 has
 incredible
 experience
 and
 the


level
 of
 EX
 internal
 excitement
 of


trying
 to
 build
 something
 from
 new
 that


doesn't
 exist
 and
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be


flying
 and
 not
 powered
 by
 engine
 is
 also


very
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 we
 as
 a


company
 at
 Ferrari
 are
 thinking
 about


the
 future
 when
 is
 she
 going
 to
 be


launched
 we
 want
 to
 launch
 it
 when
 we


will
 launch
 the
 electric
 car
 all
 right


in
 20
 the
 actual
 year
 will
 be
 2026
 how


do
 you


relax
 do
 you


relax
 that's
 a
 good
 question
 I
 I'm
 very


fortunate
 to
 really
 love
 what
 what
 I
 do


and
 uh
 I
 like
 to
 spend
 time
 with
 my


family
 as
 a
 family
 we
 like
 to
 travel
 we


used
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 cultural
 uh


traveling
 and
 then
 at
 some
 point
 our


second
 son
 said
 that
 we
 ought
 to
 also


explore
 nature
 and
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 to
 be


learned
 by
 nature
 which
 we
 have
 been


doing
 and
 one
 of
 our
 most
 recent
 trips


was
 not
 far
 from
 here
 we
 went
 to
 uh
 to


visit
 uh
 Iceland
 which
 was
 an
 incredible


incredible
 trip
 and
 we
 enjoy
 sports
 we


enjoy
 practicing
 Sports
 we
 enjoy
 uh


watching
 sports
 together
 as
 a
 family
 and


personally
 sailing
 has
 being
 a
 big


passion
 of
 mine
 I'm
 not
 able
 to
 sail
 as


much
 as
 I
 would
 like
 but
 in
 the
 last


decade
 I've
 been
 able
 to
 sail


competitively
 and
 doing
 in
 incredible


Adventures
 Cape
 Town
 to
 Rio
 Los
 Angeles


to
 Honolulu
 and
 the
 most
 recent
 one
 was


Hong
 Kong
 to
 to
 Vietnam
 last
 last
 year


and
 those
 are
 moment


of
 where
 you
 are
 in
 a
 very
 small


environment
 as
 you
 being
 a
 sailor
 you


know
 which
 creates
 very
 strong


camaraderie
 and
 intimacy
 and
 you're
 you


are
 in
 these
 extraordinary
 scenes
 where


you
 live
 with
 nature
 and
 the
 wind
 takes


you
 or
 there's
 no
 wind
 then
 you
 need
 to


wait
 and
 you
 are
 within
 the
 ocean
 and


those


are
 really
 magical


moments
 now
 John
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people
 the
 ad
 the
 advice
 to
 young


people
 is
 first
 of
 all
 they
 need
 to
 be


optimistic
 about
 the
 future
 because
 the


future
 is
 theirs
 and
 they
 have
 the


responsibility
 of
 building
 that
 future


and
 that's
 not
 daunting
 it's
 exciting
 on


a
 more
 practical
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 advice


that
 my
 grandfather
 gave
 me
 remains
 true


to
 listen
 and
 ask
 questions
 and
 in
 some


ways
 curiosity
 and
 learning
 are
 really


what
 you
 need
 to
 start
 young
 at
 well
 um


J
 it's
 been
 great
 um
 hosting
 you
 here
 in


in
 Oslo
 I
 think
 Italy
 is
 very
 lucky
 to


have
 you
 and
 I
 think
 we
 need
 many
 more


people
 like
 you
 in
 Europe
 generally
 so


all
 the
 best
 of
 luck
 with
 everything


colai
 thank
 you
