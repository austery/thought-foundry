Hello everyone, I am Anthony
Welcome to my channel
This video
I want to talk to you about China’s nationalist propaganda
I want to start with the Great Wall
Some time ago
A friend
She shared with me a unique viewpoint she had recently
That is to say, the function of the Great Wall is not only to defend against foreign enemies.
Its other equally important
Even more important is to control the people.
Preventing people from running away
She also shared this view with her friends
But my friends strongly disagree
I think this is misleading from Western thought.
In this video, let's talk about this point of view
This video
It will also be included in the list of "History and Society"
If you have anything you want to discuss with me
And consulting topics
You can contact my email to make an appointment
So let's get back to our topic today.
We say, the Great Wall
In Chinese nationalist discourse
Occupies an extremely important position
It is often used as a symbol of the Chinese national spirit.
In various songs, poems, movies and TV shows
Being constantly summoned
To inspire patriotic sentiment among the audience
For example, in Zhang Mingmin's song "My Chinese Heart"
There is a famous line in the lyrics: "The Yangtze River, the Great Wall,
Huangshan Mountain, Yellow River
It weighs a thousand pounds in my heart."
Like the Yellow River and the Yangtze River
Here
The Connotation of the Great Wall
It also goes far beyond specific architectural remains.
and condensed into
A symbol of Chinese identity
Pattern on RMB
In major celebrations or promotional posters
The Great Wall is often described as solid, long,
Image of protection and unity
Defense is of course the first function of the Great Wall
It represents the will to resist external aggression
In the official propaganda
The Great Wall is also often associated with defending the country.
For example, emphasizing that the People's Army is a Great Wall of Steel
The South China Sea is China's Great Wall on the Sea, etc.
As Callahan discusses in this article
As stated in the Chinese Nationalist paper:
The Great Wall is not only a physical border
Or is it the dividing line between the Chinese and the barbarians?
It symbolizes the binary opposition between civilization and barbarism
On one side of the wall is the ancient, continuous and superior Chinese civilization
On the other side are dangerous, terrifying invaders.
Therefore, the Great Wall first embodies an inward-looking
and defensive nationalism
To build such a huge defense project
It must be built on the labor of countless people.
This is the second meaning of the Great Wall
That is, through collective mobilization
Make countless individuals unite as one and be brave enough to sacrifice
can be gathered into a strong will of the country and the nation
As a Chinese elementary school language text puts it:
"How much blood, sweat and wisdom of the working people
It condensed into this endless
The Great Wall with no end in sight
So we say inward defense and collective mobilization
This is the connotation that Chinese nationalism has given to the Great Wall.
But this is not the case in every country.
For example, Marianne, the national symbol of France
It represents the spirit of rationality, republicanism and autonomy.
Brandenburg Gate in Germany
Although it initially symbolized the Prussian monarchy
But now
It represents more cooperation and peace in Europe
In contrast
The spiritual connotation of the Great Wall
It appears more conservative, closed and exclusive
It defines those within the wall as “us”
Defining people outside the wall as “others”
Walls are there to protect us from others.
The opposition between the two is clear.
However, this narrative is rather simplistic and one-sided.
The real function of the Great Wall is much more than this.
The success of nationalism lies in
It takes the concept of an abstract community
Through symbols like the Great Wall and large-scale rituals
Transformed into daily life
Things that allow the public to project their emotions
In the process
It brings together various specific differences and conflicts
Flattened to “We”
Thus obscuring and hiding "who rules whom"
This core issue
In fact, the Great Wall not only defends against foreign enemies,
Also defending the so-called own people
This is clearly reflected in
Emperor Yuan of Han's attitude towards the Xiongnu
then
Huhanye Chanyu surrenders to the Han Dynasty
Emperor Yuan of Han was very happy
Give him Wang Zhaojun as his wife
So Huhanye wrote to the emperor
Said he was willing to help the Han Dynasty defend its borders
Ask the emperor to withdraw the soldiers guarding the border
Good rest and recuperation
All the ministers agreed with this suggestion.
Only Langzhong Linghou should object
He listed 10 reasons
The first few reasons are nothing more than saying that the Huns are barbarians.
No credibility
Maybe they will rebel tomorrow.
Can't trust them
But the key point behind
But he focused on preventing his own people from escaping.
For example, the fourth reason says:
China still builds passes and bridges to control the princes
So I cut off the desire for victory for my subordinates.
Set up forts and garrisons
Not just the Huns
They were also surrendered people from various vassal states.
Originally from the Xiongnu
Fearing that he would miss the past and flee
This sentence means that
The country built various passes and city walls
Not just to guard against the Huns
Mainly to stop the ministers from having extravagant thoughts
That is to prevent the ministers from rebellion
in addition
It was also to avoid some Huns who had surrendered to the Han Dynasty.
Running away because of missing home
The sixth reason is that many soldiers who joined the army
He stayed in the Xiongnu and never came back.
Their families are often poor.
so
They also had the motivation to run to the Xiongnu to reunite with their relatives.
Article 7 says
Those frontier people and slaves who were trapped in difficult situations
They heard that the Xiongnu lived happily there.
That is to say, "Hearing the music of the Xiongnu"
I really want to run away
Although the soldiers were watching closely
But many managed to escape.
Article 8 states that
There were many robbers and thieves in the Han Dynasty
They often break the law in groups
If you are pushed
Maybe he could run to the Huns.
Escape from legal punishment
We can see
The group of people who wanted to escape at that time was very wide.
It not only includes those who have surrendered to the Han Dynasty
But the Huns wanted to go home
And the soldiers' families
Poverty-stricken people, slaves
and those who violate the criminal law
And they generally believe
Life is better in the Xiongnu
This makes people think
Why are there so many people?
Want to escape from civilization and education
Would you rather run to a barbaric place?
Obviously the Xiongnu were not rich either.
Actually, this is not difficult to understand
Nationalism
Often assume that “we” are a monolithic group
“We” must be naturally superior to “them”
So there is no need to consider the real situation inside "us"
However, internal social injustice, oppression and poverty
Often more serious than so-called foreign threats
Although the legitimacy of the Han Dynasty came from its resistance to the Qin system
However
Since the Qin system was indeed efficient in centralization and mobilization
Therefore, the Han Dynasty had a strong institutional and power structure.
Still inherited the previous dynasty
By the time of Emperor Liu Che
Like the group of meritorious officials during the founding period of the Western Han Dynasty,
Various princes and other factors that are not conducive to dictatorship
It's almost been eradicated.
Thus, the imperial power reached its peak.
This is mainly reflected in the economic
The salt and iron industry and the politics of cruel officials
We will talk about the salt and iron government later
Here we will focus on the politics of cruel officials.
Emperor Wu of Han
The politics of cruel officials reached its peak
Although the later emperors restrained themselves
But the problem has never been fundamentally solved
Cruel politics
To meet the high-intensity absorption target
In order to better extract resources
The imperial power of the Han Dynasty
Numerous laws and decrees have been issued
As recorded in the Daxue Yanyi
When Liu Bang entered Xianyang
Abolish the harsh and cumbersome Qin laws
Three Articles of Agreement with the Qin People
Only punish murder, wounding and theft
Later, Xiao He increased the number of laws and regulations to nine chapters.
Shusun Tong added eighteen chapters to the
The Qin law was gradually restored.
By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, Liu Che
Only fifty or sixty years
The number of laws in the Han Dynasty increased to 359 chapters.
There are 409 death penalty items.
Involving 1882 behaviors
The number of judgment criteria and detailed rules has increased to more than 13,000
The total number of words has reached one million.
and
These laws are often made on the spur of the moment.
Don't care about the law itself
Is there a self-consistent and unified logic?
Therefore, cases of the same nature
The judgment criteria of different laws are also inconsistent
Law enforcement is about avoiding punishment from superiors
Tend to choose a more stringent standard
The author cited the case of Lü Bushu handling Huainan
Tens of thousands of people were sentenced to death at one time.
Considering that there were only tens of millions of people in the country during the Western Han Dynasty
This is equivalent to wiping out about one thousandth of the population at once.
This is a very shocking proportion.
In addition, we must take into account
Most people in the Han Dynasty were illiterate.
And the flow of information is extremely slow
Therefore, most of the subjects
I don't understand these laws and precedents at all.
This leads to
Law enforcement officers can easily exploit information gaps
To manipulate the people
The subjects of the empire
Living in this airtight environment for a long time
The author laments
The law has become ridiculous.
Every move of the people may violate the criminal law
It's a miracle that such a country has not perished
Since Liu Che himself liked to promote and appoint cruel officials
Therefore, officials from all over the country also instinctively followed suit.
The entire bureaucratic machine exhibits a sadistic tendency
For example, some cruel officials would exterminate the entire family of the victim.
Some like to saw people's necks
Some like to use sticks to extort bribes, etc.
Under such harsh violence
Most of the subjects were in a state where life was worse than death.
We have said before
Hou Ying believes
Walls and passes prevented thieves from escaping to the Xiongnu
There should be no preconceived notion here
These thieves are bad guys.
Because in the Han Dynasty, when a thief
Often it is an act of helplessness.
As recorded in the "Records of the Grand Historian: Biographies of Cruel Officials":
"Officials and people are more likely to break the law, and thieves are on the rise.
Nanyang has Meimian, Bai Zheng
Chu has Yin Zhong, Du Shao
Qi You Xu Bo
Between Yan and Zhao there are people like Jianlu and Fansheng.
Large groups up to several thousand people
He called the shots without authorization, attacked cities, and took soldiers from the treasury.
Pardon the death penalty and tie up and humiliate the county governor."
that is
At that time, the people were generally forced to live
So the whole country was filled with rebels.
Including Nanyang, which is very close to the center of the empire
They may be a group of hundreds of people
Or a group of thousands of people
Attacking the City
Killing local officials
Release of death row inmates
From this we can also understand
Why did so many Han Dynasty people think
The Huns were happy living in a simple and barbaric environment.
Because although the Huns were also poor and lacking
But the customary law of the tribe still prevails.
There weren't as many outrageous and strict laws as in the Han Dynasty.
Nor will they resort to torture and collective punishment.
This kind of annoying thing
For the fugitives from the Han Dynasty
The Huns took a pragmatic attitude
They were allowed to teach the Huns how to cast iron, how to farm,
Making clothes, etc.
It is equivalent to accepting skilled immigrants
Some were also promoted to advisors and messengers.
To some extent
These Han people who crossed the Great Wall to go to the Xiongnu
With East Germans trying to cross the Berlin Wall
North Koreans who want to defect are the same
Berlin Wall, 38th Parallel
Although it has the function of defending against Western invasion
But its more essential function is to prevent our own people from escaping.
Nationalist narrative
I will only accuse these people of being traitors.
Using patriotism or other ideologies
Stigmatize them
But avoided its own hypocrisy
In this historical perspective
The Central Plains civilization is often assumed to be advanced,
A symbol of progress and morality
The Huns were backward, barbaric and unethical.
But the reality is very complicated
The so-called civilization
Maybe it's just a more sophisticated form of tyranny.
for example
The Huns had a marriage system at that time.
After my father passed away
Son can marry stepmother
After my brother's death
Brother can also marry sister-in-law
This is seen in the Confucian ethics of the Central Plains.
Of course it is treasonous.
Barbarian behavior that violates moral principles
However
This criticism
Not from the perspective of human rights and humanity
Women in the Han Dynasty
Although not as bound and imprisoned as in the Ming and Qing dynasties
However, the official also clearly
Encourage and emphasize the concept of chastity for women
For example, Ban Zhao's "Female Precepts" in the Eastern Han Dynasty
Often referred to as the beginning of women's education in ancient China
Then this article "Women's Rings" says:
"A husband has the right to remarry
A Woman Cannot Marry Another Man
Therefore, it is said: Husband is Heaven.
There is no escape from the sky
"Husband is inseparable."
That means the husband can remarry.
But the wife should not remarry
Husband is like heaven
The sky is inevitable
This is equivalent to looking at the universe and natural order from the perspective of
Established the status of male superiority and female inferiority
Ban Zhao's article is often praised for its beautiful writing style.
However
This is just a beautiful phrase
A disguised civilization
Compared with the primitive and crude system of the Huns,
Which one is more civilized?
It's hard to tell
So we can see
The actual functions of the Great Wall are highly complex and diverse
It is the boundary of power
It could also be a cage of oppression
It can be used as a dividing line between civilization and barbarism.
Or maybe it's just part of civilization's self-deification
Nationalism needs to maintain an imagined us
Therefore, there is an urgent need
Some visible, collective object of worship
To carry collective identity
Once selected
These symbols
Whether it is the Great Wall, the national flag or the national myth
It is often given a super-historical and natural meaning.
It transcends time and space and is impartial and selfless.
Therefore it is noble and sacred
If it is just a temporary, accidental
Or special products
Then its sublimity will be eliminated.
What we are going to discuss next is
Since modern times
How the Great Wall is used in different political contexts
The reinterpreted
How has its symbolism changed in the hands of different regimes?
Constantly manipulated, updated and reproduced
At the beginning of the Republic of China
The Great Wall’s Enclosure
Considered to be an obstacle to transportation and social development
It is also seen as a symbol of the division of national unity.
Should be demolished and criticized
During the New Culture Movement
Intellectuals
The Great Wall
Seen as a symbol of backwardness that hinders China's modernization
In 1925, Lu Xun published the short essay "The Great Wall"
It is said that building the Great Wall was just a waste of many workers.
It didn't really stop the Hu people.
Now it is just a relic.
Lu Xun said that he always felt that there was a Great Wall surrounding him.
This Great Wall surrounds people
When will we stop adding new bricks to the Great Wall?
This great and cursed Great Wall!
this
Obviously, Lu Xun strongly denied and criticized the Great Wall.
But also during this time
Many scholars and intellectuals
Beginning to realize
The role of the Great Wall in establishing the national spirit
Thus gradually began to avoid the backwardness of the Great Wall
For example, Sun Yat-sen praised the greatness of the Great Wall.
Call it a unique wonder of the world
It is believed that without the Great Wall as a defense
China would have perished at the hands of barbarians during the Qin and Han dynasties.
During the Anti-Japanese War
The Great Wall is almost synonymous with China.
It symbolizes the spirit of resistance against Japanese invaders.
For example, the famous lyrics
"Build a new Great Wall with flesh and blood"
At this time, the negative image of the Great Wall almost completely disappeared.
After 1949
The Great Wall is a visual symbol of defending the country.
It started to fade away
The new era requires socialism
Realism is the highest criterion for literary creation
Great Hall of the People, Monument to the People's Heroes
Factories and trains representing the development of heavy industry
And the idol symbol of Mao Zedong
It became the mainstream symbol of this period.
The ancient Great Wall
As a symbol of old China
was marginalized intentionally or unintentionally
Until the reform and opening up
With the deepening of ideological emancipation
Ideological Symbols of the Mao Era
Gradually going bankrupt among the people
National spiritual image
Some vacuum areas began to appear
So the authorities started to pick up the Great Wall again.
As a new symbol to fill the vacuum and unite the spirit
As Deng Xiaoping put forward in 1984:
"Love my China, build my Great Wall"
The spiritual significance of restoring the Great Wall
It is far more significant than the actual
on the other hand
Because the authorities still need to face pressure from the West
There is an urgent need for a symbol of solidity,
Symbol of resistance and solidarity
To cope with the anxiety of being surrounded and infiltrated
Therefore, the ancient image of the Great Wall
Once again given a defensive
The connotation of nationalism
Anyway, we can see
The significance of the Great Wall is not static
At different stages in history
Constantly given new symbols and missions
Its symbolic value
As state power and ideology change
The circulating
From a closed symbol that hinders modernization
To the national symbol that inspired the spirit of the War of Resistance
From the marginalized old Chinese heritage
To become the core totem of "cultural confidence" again
The image of the Great Wall
Always shaped and rewritten by realistic political needs
This also reminds us
In the face of those seemingly "eternal"
The “sacred” symbol of nationalism
We should maintain a sense of history
and critical thinking
Distinguish between personal and national sentiments
Don't be easily offended
Many times
Things that are endowed with noble meaning
It's not because it's sacred.
But because it is at a particular moment
It happens to be used to maintain a certain structure
