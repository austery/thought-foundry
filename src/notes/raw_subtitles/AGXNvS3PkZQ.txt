Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Friday,
 October
 31st.


Happy
 Halloween
 to
 everybody.
 I
 did
 not


dress
 up
 because
 this
 week
 has
 been
 one


of
 the
 most
 wild
 weeks
 this
 year.
 I
 have


barely
 went
 outside
 this
 week.
 So,


nine-hour
 streams
 basically


eight,
 seven
 to
 eight
 hour
 streams
 every


day
 outside
 of
 the
 nine
 hour
 stream.
 I


mean,
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 have
 an
 outfit.
 I'm


sorry.
 I
 just
 This
 was
 This
 was
 a
 wild


week.
 I
 guess
 you
 can
 call
 me
 uh
 stock


market
 YouTuber
 who
 is
 absolutely


exhausted
 after
 a
 week
 of
 earnings,
 but


it's
 worth
 it
 given
 S&P
 500
 right
 here


is
 at
 alltime
 highs.
 And
 we've
 got


Amazon,
 which
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that


absolutely
 demolished
 earnings.
 Amazon


right
 here,
 25265.


I
 guess
 I
 dressed
 up
 as
 rich
 on
 Amazon


today.
 That's
 I
 guess
 you
 can
 say
 a
 lot


of
 us
 dressed
 up
 with
 that.


Yeah,
 we're
 live
 and
 we're
 here
 for
 the


market
 open.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 Um
 I
 hope
 everyone
 has
 been


having
 a
 good
 week.
 It's
 been
 a
 long


week,
 dude.
 It's
 been
 a
 long
 freaking


week.
 There's
 just
 been
 so
 much
 going
 on


and
 again
 this
 has
 been
 an
 exciting


week,
 but
 we're
 getting
 into
 the
 home


stretch
 of
 2025.
 So
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those


weeks
 that
 we
 really
 needed
 to
 have
 as
 a


good
 week.
 And
 we
 needed
 big
 tech


earnings
 to
 be
 good.
 We
 needed
 the
 Fed


to
 cut.
 We
 you
 know
 all
 of
 us
 this
 is


real
 money
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 I
 know


we
 all
 look
 at
 numbers
 and
 candlesticks


go
 up
 and
 down,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 every
 dollar
 of
 these
 stocks
 up
 or


down
 does
 affect
 all
 of
 us
 in
 some
 way


and
 affect
 our
 families.
 So,
 we
 needed
 a


good
 week
 and
 uh
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 got
 a


relatively
 good
 week
 and
 hopefully
 we


can
 end
 out
 the
 week
 pretty
 strong
 on


this
 Friday.
 Even
 yesterday
 when
 we
 had


that
 1%
 decline
 on
 the
 S&P,
 which
 I


don't
 even
 know
 why.
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 any
 meaningful
 reason
 for
 why
 we


had
 that
 draw
 down.
 We're
 back
 basically


up
 1%
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Everything


that
 we
 lost,
 we
 are
 pretty
 much
 getting


back.
 And
 it's
 likely
 because
 Amazon
 and


Apple
 just
 had
 monster
 earnings.
 Apple,


by
 the
 way,


276.
 At
 one
 point,
 it
 hit
 284.
 So,
 they


had
 an
 they
 had
 a
 great
 earnings,
 then


they
 crushed
 it.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 that.


Reddit,
 it's
 up
 10%.
 Amazon
 obviously


13%.
 Massive,
 massive
 day.
 They
 crushed


it.
 Meta
 starting
 to
 recover
 a
 little


bit
 from
 the
 lows
 at
 650.
 Palunteer,
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 try
 to
 push
 200
 when


the
 market
 opens,
 which
 will
 be
 great
 to


see.
 Nvidia
 back
 above
 200.
 Tesla
 446.


Robin
 Hood
 141.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum


starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


recovery.
 Bitcoin
 at
 109.6.
 It
 fell
 to


105
 yesterday.
 Ethereum
 fell
 to
 3,700


back
 at
 3850.
 I
 know
 they've
 been


lagging.
 And
 Bitcoin's
 got
 to
 have
 like


a
 $7,000
 candle
 to
 end
 green
 for


October.
 Um,
 but
 regardless,
 you
 do
 have


a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum
 coming
 back
 in


the
 pre-market,
 which
 is
 very
 nice
 to


see
 as
 we
 get
 into
 it.
 So,
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Excited
 to


talk.
 Next
 week's
 also
 going
 to
 be


crazy.
 Monday,
 we've
 got
 Paler.
 That's
 a


big
 one.
 Uh
 we
 also
 have
 Grab
 on
 Monday.


So,
 you
 know,
 and
 then
 and
 then
 we
 have


Hood
 I
 think
 on
 Wednesday.
 So,
 it's
 just


going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 massive
 week
 next


week.
 This
 was
 really
 important
 for
 the


stock
 market
 next
 week
 is
 really


important
 for
 my
 portfolio.
 Also
 really


important
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


long
 those
 names.
 And
 uh
 we
 are
 pretty


much
 done
 with
 40%
 of
 big
 tech
 earnings


or
 of
 of
 the
 S&P
 500
 earnings.
 And
 so,


this
 was
 one
 of
 those
 weeks
 we
 had
 to


get
 through.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 long
 week,
 but


we
 got
 through
 it
 and
 we
 are
 here.
 All


right.
 So,
 since
 it's
 Friday,
 let's
 do


what
 we
 usually
 do
 on
 Fridays
 in
 the


morning.
 Where
 are
 you
 watching
 from?


You
 can
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 where
 are
 you


watching
 from.
 We'll
 see
 where
 everyone


is.
 Hopefully,
 everyone
 gets
 to
 enjoy


the
 weekend.
 Also,
 we
 will
 have
 Palenter


Weekly
 today.
 I
 know
 we
 haven't
 had
 it


in
 a
 while,
 but
 we're
 going to
 be
 doing


Paler
 Weekly
 today
 to
 do
 an
 earnings


preview
 of
 expectations.
 That'll
 be
 at


11
 PM
 Eastern
 on
 the
 channel.
 Amir
 will


definitely
 be
 there.
 Arie
 might
 make
 it.


Matt,
 I
 think,
 will
 make
 it,
 but
 if
 they


can't,
 then
 it'll
 definitely
 be
 me
 and


Amir.
 and
 uh
 we'll
 go
 through
 some


numbers
 and
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 for
 for


Monday
 and
 we
 will
 get
 that
 weekly
 in


tonight.


All
 right,
 where
 are
 we
 at?
 Where
 are
 we


at?
 Also,
 let
 me
 know if
 anyone's


wearing
 a
 costume
 today.
 I
 know
 I
 was


lame
 and
 don't
 don't
 have
 a
 costume,
 but


if
 you
 do
 have
 a
 costume,
 you
 can
 you


can
 tag
 me
 in
 Twitter
 and
 I
 would
 love


to
 pull
 up
 some
 costumes
 on
 the
 uh
 on


the
 stream
 and
 see
 what
 people
 are


wearing
 today.


And
 uh
 we
 can
 see
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 at


like
 a
 corporate
 job
 and
 you
 went
 to


work
 today.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 fun


things
 about
 like
 uh
 when
 I
 went
 to
 my


mom's
 job
 back
 when
 I
 was
 little
 is
 like


they
 they
 you
 know,
 they
 actually


dressed
 up
 because
 she
 worked
 at
 a


school.
 So
 she
 had
 she
 was
 sending
 me


these
 pictures
 from
 like
 2013
 because
 of


guess
 what?
 Facebook


has
 a
 moat.
 And
 she
 was
 showing
 me
 all


these
 pictures
 of
 me
 back
 when
 I
 was


like
 10
 uh
 14
 years
 old
 wearing
 these


outfits.


And
 so,
 yeah,
 let
 me
 know
 if
 anyone
 is


actually
 wearing
 anything
 today.


Uh,
 I'm
 gonna
 admit
 look
 alike.
 All


right.
 Well,
 you
 got
 to
 grow
 out
 the


beard
 then.
 I'm
 a
 Jensen
 look
 like,


dude.
 We
 have
 some
 videos
 of
 Jensen

are
 so
 tophy,
 but
 they're
 also
 so
 epic.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going

 that

 Not

 to
 do
 it.
 There's
 no

I

 So,

 grateful


for

 See,
 that's

 This

 you
 just
 had
 so


many
 events
 back
 to
 back
 toback
 that
 we


had
 to
 cover.


Um,
 but
 it's
 the
 coolest
 thing
 in
 the


world
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this
 every
 single


day
 with
 a
 community
 that
 truly
 is


global.
 So,
 thank
 you everybody
 for


being
 being
 here.
 Deeply
 appreciate
 it.


Hopefully
 everyone
 had
 a
 good
 week
 and


we're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 end
 out
 this
 week


as
 well.
 Wow,
 I'm
 getting
 some
 of
 these


pictures.
 Oh,
 this
 is
 awesome.
 This
 is

 Look

 Love

 Pilot.
 Yeah,

you've
 got

 tag
 me
 in

 I


would
 love
 to
 show
 the
 stream.
 Look
 at


that.
 I
 love
 it.
 This
 is
 great.
 This
 is


Love
 to
 Fly
 Fly
 Pilot.
 I
 met
 him
 at
 the


um
 the
 Bay
 Area
 meetup.
 He
 is
 the
 person


that
 actually
 gave
 us
 the
 big
 pounder


bell
 and
 uh
 he
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 pounder.


Look
 at
 that.
 I
 love
 it.
 Great
 outfit.


Absolutely
 incredible.


So
 cool.
 Yeah,
 tag
 me
 in
 these
 pictures.


I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 the
 Halloween


outfits
 today


and
 it
 would
 be
 super
 cool
 to
 kind
 of


see
 all
 them.
 All
 right,
 let's
 get


started.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Let's
 start
 off


with
 Amazon.
 We
 got
 to
 start
 off
 with


Amazon.
 We
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


macro
 stuff
 to
 talk
 about,
 but
 Amazon
 is


the
 big
 one
 today.
 And
 uh
 let's
 cover


what
 happened.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,


congratulations
 to
 everyone
 in
 Amazon.
 I


think
 on
 the
 channel
 publicly,
 we


started
 really
 talking
 about
 Amazon


basically
 a
 month
 ago.
 Call
 it
 early


September.
 And
 uh
 the
 reason
 for
 that,


it
 kind
 of
 just
 piqued
 my
 interest.
 It


was
 that
 the
 stock
 was
 negative
 year-to-


date,
 although
 the
 NASDAQ
 was
 up
 almost


20%,
 the
 S&P
 500
 was
 up
 11%.
 And
 so
 this


was
 the
 post
 I
 made.
 Yeah.
 Towards
 the


middle
 of
 September,
 as
 you
 can
 see


right
 here,
 and
 the
 two
 ter
 the
 two


reasons
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 down,


tariffs
 might
 affect
 their
 commerce


business,
 AWS
 not
 as
 exciting.
 And
 the


thesis
 simply
 was,
 and
 there
 was
 a
 lot


of
 comments
 and
 engagement
 under
 under


these
 posts
 that
 just
 like
 it
 doesn't


deserve
 to
 be
 trading
 at
 these
 levels.


And
 this
 was
 at
 222.
 That's
 when
 I


initiated
 the
 position.
 It
 ends
 up
 going


down
 to
 212.
 And
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 kind


of
 came
 together
 and
 said,
 "This
 is
 one


of
 the
 most
 important
 companies
 on
 the


planet.
 Do
 they
 deserve
 to
 be
 treated


the
 way
 they're
 being
 treated?"
 And
 it's


technically
 yeah,
 they
 do
 if
 they
 can't


get
 the
 growth
 from
 AWS.
 And
 so
 what
 did


Jasse
 deliver
 yesterday?
 He
 delivered


the
 growth
 on
 AWS.


And
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 changed


anything.
 I
 mean,
 sometimes
 it's
 really


simple.
 Sometimes
 it's
 one
 thing
 that


the
 street
 needs
 for
 a
 change.
 And
 once


you
 give
 what
 the
 street
 needs,


everything
 changes.
 Online
 stores
 up
 10%


year-over-year.
 Third
 party
 seller


services
 up
 12%
 year-over-year.
 Amazon


web
 services
 20%.


That's
 the
 big
 one.
 Physical
 stores
 7%,


subscriptions
 11%,
 and
 then
 advertising


24%
 at
 an
 $18
 billion


uh
 quarterly
 run
 rate,
 which
 is
 just


incredible.
 I
 mean,
 we
 don't
 talk
 enough


about
 the
 advertising
 business,
 but
 high


margin
 business
 and
 Amazon
 continues
 to


crush
 it.
 Now,
 what
 did
 Jasse
 say?
 He


said,
 "We
 haven't
 seen
 this
 type
 of
 AWS


growth
 since
 2022."
 That's
 it.
 As
 soon


as
 he
 said
 that,
 it
 was
 over.
 And
 I


don't
 know if
 Amazon's
 going
 to
 hold
 the


14%
 move
 right
 now.
 I
 I
 definitely
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 harder
 to
 go
 back
 to


220.
 Uh
 but
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 reason


it's
 actually
 maintaining
 this
 momentum


in
 the
 pre-market
 and
 it's
 not
 getting


faded
 away
 is
 because
 when
 Jasse
 says,


"Guys,
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 this
 type
 of


growth
 in
 almost
 three
 years.
 The
 street


pays
 attention."
 And
 what
 does
 the


street
 care
 about
 the
 most?
 They
 care


about
 the
 one
 thing
 we've
 been
 talking


about,
 which
 is
 AWS
 acceleration.
 The


whisper
 number,
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 came
 in


at
 2.2%.
 The
 whisper
 number
 was
 18.9%.


So,
 they
 beat
 the
 whisper
 number.
 The


whisper
 number
 is
 like
 the
 the
 number


that
 Wall
 Street
 is
 literally
 whispering


about,
 but
 like
 is
 not
 the
 actual
 number


they're
 expecting.
 When
 you
 beat
 that


number,
 you
 win.
 When
 you
 beat
 that


number,
 you
 win.
 And
 it's
 really
 hard
 to


lose.
 Um,
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 that's
 why


you
 had
 some
 momentum.
 Jasse
 on
 the
 call


said,
 "Another
 1
 gawatt
 coming
 in
 Q4
 and


expect
 to
 double
 load
 capacity
 by
 2027.


Power
 remains
 the
 main
 industry


bottleneck
 on
 the
 tranium
 demand.
 Our


custom
 tranium
 2
 chips
 are
 fully


subscribed
 with
 30
 to
 40%
 better
 price


performance
 than
 competitors.
 They're


basically
 building
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


mini
 Nvidia
 inside
 of
 Amazon,
 trading
 at


half
 the
 valuation
 of
 Nvidia.
 Obviously,


they
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 growth
 as


Nvidia,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 you're
 you're


getting
 something
 that
 barely
 is
 up
 here


to
 date.
 Now,
 it's
 up
 around
 14%.
 Uh,


and
 the
 moat
 is
 a
 moat
 that
 truly
 just


can't
 be
 denied,
 and
 it
 is
 one
 of
 those


companies
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 around
 for


a
 long
 time.
 Demand
 remains
 strong


across
 large
 and
 midsize
 customers.


Tranium
 3
 will
 preview
 later
 this
 year


with
 full
 volumes
 expected
 in
 early


2026.


I
 mean
 again,
 this
 was
 one
 of
 those


companies
 that's
 like
 it's
 not
 going


anywhere.
 It
 could
 become
 a
 cornerstone


of
 the
 portfolio
 at
 250
 over
 the
 long


term.
 It
 likely
 is
 still
 cheap,
 right?


May
 I
 probably
 wouldn't
 chase
 it
 today


after
 the
 run
 that
 it's
 having.
 But


nonetheless,
 if
 you're
 ready
 to
 hold
 on


to
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 then
 this


company's
 going
 to
 be
 here
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Capex,
 they're
 going to
 be


spending
 125
 billion
 this
 year.
 So


that's
 up
 from
 the
 expectations
 of


around
 118
 billion.
 And
 then
 for
 fiscal


year
 2026,
 they
 are
 projecting
 to
 spend


more
 than
 125
 billion.
 So
 you've
 got
 the


capex
 taken
 care
 of,
 which
 is
 uh
 really


good
 for
 the
 semiconductor
 names,


especially
 Nvidia.
 I
 think
 that's
 why


Nvidia
 is
 up
 right
 now.
 They're
 not


giving
 you
 a
 dividend
 or
 a
 share


buyback.
 So
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 reinvest


into
 the
 business
 or
 they
 can
 only


reinvest
 into
 the
 business
 because
 they


don't
 have
 to
 reward
 external


shareholders.
 And
 the
 street's
 rewarding


them
 for
 that
 because
 they
 got
 the


growth.
 Like
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 give


us
 a
 dividend
 or
 share
 buyback,
 give
 us


the
 growth.
 Jasse
 deliver
 the
 growth.


Uh,
 and
 then
 number
 three,
 their


operating
 margins
 were
 down
 from
 11.8%


to
 9.4%,
 but
 from
 my
 understanding,
 this


was
 more
 so
 because
 of
 the
 layoffs
 and


one-time
 severance
 charges.
 So
 imagine


operating
 margins
 are
 still
 at
 12%.


Again,
 if
 they
 increase
 that
 closer
 to


15
 20%
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years,
 you're


talking
 about
 a
 company
 that's
 likely


going
 to
 be
 doing
 200
 billion
 in


operating
 income.
 And
 that
 is
 a
 company


that
 probably
 gets
 closer
 to
 the
 $45


trillion
 valuation,
 which
 is
 basically
 a


double
 from
 here.
 And
 so
 it's
 not
 that


scary
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 going
 to
 hold
 on


to
 Amazon
 stock
 for
 a
 long
 time."
 Now,


operating
 income
 was
 flat


year-over-year.
 That
 is
 true.
 And
 free


cash
 flow
 is
 not
 uh,
 you
 know,
 growing


the
 way
 the
 way
 Google
 and
 Microsoft
 is


growing.
 The
 the
 one
 reason
 they
 beat
 on


EPS,
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 beat
 by
 30%
 is


because
 they
 recognized
 their
 investment


from
 Anthropic.
 So
 again,
 they
 have
 a


$9.4
 billion
 investment
 in
 Anthropic
 and


that
 has
 been
 or
 $9.4
 billion
 gain
 from


Enthropic
 and
 another
 startup
 they


invested
 in
 and
 that
 allowed
 them
 to


beat
 on
 EPS.
 But
 quite
 frankly,
 even
 if


they
 missed
 on
 EPS,
 I
 don't know
 if
 the


stock
 would
 be
 up
 15%,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it
 would
 be
 down
 15%.
 And
 the
 reason
 for


that
 is
 because
 the
 only
 story
 that


really
 mattered
 was
 AWS.
 This
 is


literally
 the
 only
 thing
 the
 street


wanted
 to
 see.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 the


street
 got
 it
 and
 they
 got
 it
 at
 a


number
 that
 was
 way
 above
 expectations,


that
 lets
 you
 know
 the
 demand
 for
 AI


workloads
 is
 strong
 and
 Amazon
 is
 is


fulfilling
 that
 demand.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you're
 getting
 some


great
 momentum
 as
 uh
 the
 stock
 continues


to
 move.
 So
 very
 very
 nice
 to
 see.


Congrats
 to
 everyone
 at
 Amazon.
 This
 was


a
 big
 retail
 victory.
 Uh
 definitely
 a


big
 retail
 victory
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 that


came
 together.
 So
 many
 of
 you
 in
 the


chat
 tagged
 me
 in
 post
 and
 sent
 me
 DMs


and
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 got
 to
 look
 at
 this.


You
 got
 to
 look
 at
 this."
 And
 like
 it


was,
 look,
 Amazon's
 not
 the
 hardest


stock
 to
 own.
 It's
 just
 whenever
 a
 stock


is
 down
 relative
 to
 its
 peers,
 you
 start


to
 feel
 like
 an
 idiot
 buying
 this
 stock


over
 the
 winners
 because
 it's
 obviously


not
 the
 winner
 at
 the
 time.
 But
 that's


when
 the
 opportunity
 is.
 That's
 where


the
 alpha
 is.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 the


long
 the
 longer
 everyone
 invests,
 the


more
 they
 realize
 the
 alpha
 is
 where


everyone
 is
 not
 looking
 at.
 And


thankfully,
 people
 weren't
 looking
 at


freaking
 Amazon
 for
 the
 past
 two
 months.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 people
 got
 to


take
 a
 position
 in
 the
 company
 and
 now


we
 get
 to
 benefit
 from
 the
 gains.
 So


absolutely
 incredible,
 great
 Amazon


earnings
 and
 congrats
 to
 everyone
 who
 is


in
 Amazon
 as
 well.
 All right,
 we
 got
 a


couple
 more
 pictures.
 Let
 me
 show
 you


guys
 some
 of
 these
 pictures
 that
 I'm


seeing
 that
 you
 guys
 are
 tagging
 me.
 And


again,
 if
 you're
 dressed
 up,
 definitely


tag
 me
 in
 these
 pictures.
 This
 stuff
 is


pretty
 cool
 to
 see.
 We
 got
 Bobby
 right


here.
 I
 was
 an
 Amazon
 Courier.
 I


definitely
 said
 that
 wrong.
 Courier


yesterday.
 I
 wore
 my
 team
 jersey
 on


Super
 Bowl
 Thursday.


Look
 at
 that.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Bobby.


I
 love
 it.
 And
 then
 we
 got
 Tyler.
 Happy


Halloween.
 We're
 cosplaying
 characters


from
 the
 anime
 spy
 family.
 I
 love
 it,


dude.
 I
 love
 Halloween.
 I've
 always


loved
 Halloween.
 It's
 just
 this
 week
 has


been
 crazy
 and
 I
 really
 did
 want
 to
 get


an
 outfit,
 but
 there
 was
 just
 no
 way
 I


was
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 come
 up
 with
 an


outfit
 given
 how
 busy
 it
 was.
 But
 I
 love


it.
 Awesome.
 Awesome.
 Awesome
 stuff.


Definitely
 tag
 me
 if
 you
 are
 in
 any
 of


these
 outfits
 and
 uh
 we'll
 show
 them
 on


the
 screen.
 All right,
 Apple.
 So
 let's


So
 we
 had
 Amazon.
 Let's
 talk
 Apple.


Apple
 crushed
 it
 as
 well.
 So,
 the
 big


thing
 about
 Apple
 that
 crushed
 it,
 which


I
 really
 didn't
 expect,
 is
 that
 they


increased
 their
 guidance
 for
 Q4.
 And


that
 guidance
 ended
 up
 getting
 increased


to
 10
 to
 12%
 revenue
 growth.
 Apple
 has


not
 done
 10
 to
 12%
 revenue
 growth
 in


almost
 two
 years
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


They've
 always
 been
 at
 3
 to
 4%.
 And
 so,


as
 a
 result,
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 just


haven't
 seen
 that
 type
 of
 revenue


growth.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 got
 it
 was


very
 exciting.
 5%
 EPS,
 185
 versus
 177,


and
 then
 102
 versus
 102
 billion.


Revenues
 up
 8%
 year-over-year
 EPS
 is
 up


13.
 Uh
 Tim
 Cook
 basically
 said
 he's


really
 excited
 for
 iPhone
 17.
 He's


really
 excited
 for
 the
 momentum
 they're


seeing
 in
 China,
 even
 though
 they
 missed


on
 China
 this
 quarter.
 iPhone
 also


missed.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 slight
 miss,
 but


nonetheless,
 it
 missed.
 And
 he's
 also


very
 excited
 for
 the
 overall
 AI


opportunity
 that
 exists
 long
 term.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 the
 street
 ate
 it
 up.
 I


mean,
 the
 street
 absolutely
 ate
 it
 up.


This
 is
 a
 company
 that's
 trading
 at
 a


pretty
 aggressive
 multiple
 in
 my
 opinion


for
 the
 lack
 of
 growth
 that
 they're


putting
 up,
 but
 they
 also
 have
 132


billion
 in
 cash.
 They
 are
 consistently


buying
 back
 their
 stock.
 And
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day,
 this
 is
 probably
 not
 a


company
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 going
 away


anytime
 soon
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 level
 of


distribution
 that
 they
 have
 with


consumer
 devices.
 Would
 I
 be
 buying


Apple
 here?
 No.
 But
 then
 again,
 I


haven't
 been
 buying
 Apple
 at
 198
 outside


of
 in
 the
 ETF.
 So,
 we
 have
 that
 there


for
 the
 stock
 draft.
 But
 like
 it
 doesn't


matter
 if
 I'm
 buying
 it
 or
 if
 you're


buying
 it.
 It
 matters
 if
 the
 market's


buying
 it.
 And
 given
 Apple
 is
 7%
 of
 the


S&P
 500.
 It
 really
 matters
 for
 the
 S&P


500
 if
 people
 are
 still
 buying
 it.
 And


remember,
 people
 have
 owned
 Apple
 for


the
 past
 couple
 decades.
 And
 as
 long
 as


they're
 not
 selling
 and
 they're


continuing
 to
 hold
 on
 because
 they
 see


that
 future
 belief
 in
 what
 Apple
 can


become,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 Apple
 really


having
 a
 moat
 outside
 of
 its
 numbers,


but
 more
 so
 having
 a
 moat
 in
 terms
 of


the
 scale
 and
 velocity
 of
 its
 business.


I
 think
 that's
 why
 Apple
 continues
 to


trade
 the
 way
 it
 trades.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this
 stat
 right
 here.
 uh
 capex
 now
 for


Google,
 Amazon
 and
 Microsoft
 in
 one


quarter
 was
 120
 billion.
 Tim
 Apple
 spent


12.7
 billion
 for
 capex
 in
 the
 whole


year.
 So
 basically
 Apple's
 saying
 hey


you
 guys
 can
 spend
 all
 the
 money
 and
 and


fuel
 Nvidia's
 profits.
 We
 are
 going
 to


benefit
 from
 whatever
 you
 guys
 do
 by


integrating
 you
 into
 our
 distribution


which
 is
 also
 another
 reason
 to
 get


excited
 about
 Apple
 because
 they
 don't


have
 to
 waste
 the
 money
 on
 Capex
 because


they
 don't
 necessarily
 have
 to
 build
 out


old
 models.
 Now,
 theoretically,
 a
 couple


years
 ago,
 if
 they
 decided
 to
 build


their
 own
 Apple
 LLM,
 would
 that
 have


been
 the
 right
 choice?
 Maybe.
 Maybe
 that


would
 have
 changed
 kind
 of
 how
 we
 think


of
 Apple
 as
 an
 AI
 company,
 but
 they


didn't.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 they'd
 rather


buy
 back
 their
 stock
 and
 let
 Meta
 and


OpenAI
 do
 it
 and
 Google
 and
 just
 partner


with
 them
 in
 the
 future.
 So,
 I
 think


overall,
 as
 an
 investor,
 there
 is
 not
 a


better
 week
 you
 could
 have
 had
 outside


of
 the
 conclusion
 we
 got
 to
 it


yesterday.
 Now,
 obviously,
 Meta
 could


have
 really
 helped
 the
 week
 go
 a
 lot


better,
 but
 then
 again,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 I


think
 the
 street
 is
 being
 stupid
 about


Meta.
 They
 had
 to
 pay
 their
 taxes,
 and


so
 they
 had
 an
 reaction
 to
 the
 to
 the


tax
 charge
 off.
 And
 then
 number
 two,


they're
 mad
 that
 Meta
 is
 spending
 on


capex.
 I
 think
 you
 just
 got
 to
 trust


Zucks
 that
 the
 capex
 is
 going to
 play


out.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 trust
 Zux,
 then


you
 don't
 invest.
 But
 if
 you
 do,
 and
 you


know,
 Meta
 now
 trading
 at
 20
 times
 2026


earnings,
 it
 does
 feel
 relatively
 cheap


given
 they're
 likely
 going
 to
 continue


to
 grow
 at
 25
 to
 30%.
 So,
 you
 got
 Google


that
 crushed
 it,
 Microsoft
 that
 crushed


it,
 Amazon
 that
 demolished
 it,
 uh
 Google


right
 there
 at
 285,
 Meta
 that
 did
 crush


it,
 although
 the
 optics
 didn't
 look
 the


best,
 and
 then
 Apple
 that
 continued
 to


crush
 it.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 what
 you


needed.
 This
 is
 really
 what
 we
 needed.


And
 then
 you
 got
 the
 rate
 cut.
 You
 got


the
 rate
 cut.
 So,
 the
 only
 thing
 left


for
 this
 year
 now
 to
 kind
 of
 keep
 this


playing
 out
 is
 one
 more
 rate
 cut
 in


December,
 which,
 you
 know,
 JPAL
 can
 say


whatever
 we
 want,
 but
 we're
 likely
 going


to
 get
 it.
 The
 number
 two
 is
 uh
 Nvidia.


But
 I
 think
 we
 can
 sit
 back
 a
 little
 bit


and
 at least,
 you
 know,
 allow
 the
 market


to
 consume
 these
 big
 tech
 earnings
 and


not
 be
 that
 anxious
 about
 if
 these


companies
 will
 crush
 because
 they


absolutely
 crushed.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 the


punchline
 to
 everything
 we're
 seeing,
 by


the
 way,
 Amazon
 was
 upgraded
 to
 315
 at


Morgan
 Stanley
 and
 upgraded
 to
 335
 at


Everore.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 upgrades


across
 the
 board
 as
 well.
 I
 I
 think
 the


the
 thing
 that's
 the
 most
 important


about
 this
 is
 that
 for
 the
 past
 11


quarters,
 Google
 has
 beat,
 Amazon
 has


beat,
 Microsoft
 has
 beat,
 and
 Meta
 has


beat.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 the
 simple


argument
 everyone
 is
 starting
 to
 realize


is
 that
 the
 hyperscalers
 will
 probably


go
 down
 as
 the
 easiest
 investments
 of


our
 lifetime.
 It
 is
 very
 hard,
 in
 my


opinion,
 for
 us
 to
 find
 easier


investments
 than
 the
 companies
 that


impact
 every
 single
 part
 of
 all
 of
 our


lives
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 basis,
 have
 the


free
 cash
 flow,
 the
 net
 income,
 the


balance
 sheets
 to
 support
 their
 R&D
 and


their
 growth,
 and
 ultimately
 are


companies
 that
 are
 likely
 just
 going
 to


keep
 getting
 bigger,
 which
 is
 starting


to
 make
 me
 think
 about
 2026
 portfolio


allocation
 and
 and
 and
 a
 decent
 part
 of


that
 allocation
 might
 be
 just
 to
 go
 a


little
 heavier
 into
 the
 hyperscalers,


especially
 on
 these
 dips,
 versus
 having


to
 find
 that
 next
 big
 stock,
 which
 yes


is
 very
 important
 if
 you
 want
 the
 like


increased
 you
 know
 3x
 4x
 alpha
 in
 in
 a


year
 or
 two
 years
 but
 if
 you
 want
 a


steady
 consistent
 gain
 uh
 while
 being


able
 to
 sleep
 at
 night
 and
 not
 have
 too


many
 worries
 it
 seems
 like
 the


hyperscalers


are
 important
 and
 so
 there
 you
 go
 that's


what
 you
 got
 with
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 looks


like
 they
 absolutely
 crushed
 it
 shutdown


is
 still
 here
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 shutdown


resolved
 yet
 I
 mean
 Trump's
 been


tweeting
 all
 night
 about
 how
 the


Democrats
 need
 to
 fix
 stuff
 and
 I
 don't


know
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 that
 stuff's


going
 to
 get
 resolved.
 I
 mean
 you
 are


starting
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 in
 the


country
 just
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 an


anecdotally
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 upset
 and


wondering
 why
 the
 hell
 is
 this
 happening


and
 you
 got
 each
 side
 trying
 to
 blame


the
 other
 side
 but
 I
 don't know
 we're
 in


what
 day
 30
 almost
 of
 this.


So
 hopefully
 this
 gets
 resolved
 but


obviously
 the
 market
 doesn't
 care
 about


it.
 Eventually
 it
 will
 but
 we're
 going


to
 hopefully
 need
 them
 to
 resolve
 this


pretty
 soon.
 Netflix
 did
 do
 a
 stock


split.
 Yes.
 10
 to1.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


they
 announced
 it
 today
 or
 yesterday


night.
 Uh
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 they
 should
 have


done
 it
 on
 earnings,
 but
 now
 we'll
 be


able
 to
 buy
 100
 shares
 of
 Netflix
 for


$11,000,


not
 $111,000,


which
 is
 nice.
 It's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 buy


100
 shares
 for
 100
 grand,
 but
 now
 we
 can


get
 them
 for
 11
 grand.
 So
 Netflix
 will


be
 splitting
 their
 stock.
 I
 think
 the


effective
 date
 is
 like
 in
 a
 couple


weeks,
 but
 we
 will
 be
 seeing
 this
 stock


split
 pretty
 soon.
 All right,
 let's
 talk


about
 Bur.
 So,
 uh,
 for
 those
 that


haven't
 seen,
 Michael
 Bur
 is
 back.
 This


is
 his
 Twitter
 account.
 And
 Bur
 has
 not


tweeted
 since
 January
 31st,
 2023.


The
 last
 time
 that
 Bur
 tweeted,
 he
 said


this,
 sell.
 The
 NASDAQ
 has
 doubled
 since


that.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 you
 know.
 He
 said


one
 word
 sell.
 He
 deleted
 that
 tweet


after
 on
 January
 31st,
 which
 quite
 it


was
 not
 literally
 the
 bottom,
 but
 it
 was


very
 close
 to
 the
 bottom.
 The
 bottom
 was


October
 2022.
 and
 he
 disappeared.
 He
 has


not
 tweeted
 in
 the
 past
 two
 years.
 Then


yesterday
 he
 tweets,
 "Sometimes
 we
 see


bubbles.
 Sometimes
 there
 is
 something
 to


do
 about
 it.
 Sometimes
 the
 only
 winning


move
 is
 not
 to
 play."


Very
 poetic


uh
 argument
 by
 Mr.
 Michael
 Bur.
 Look,


here's
 my
 perspective
 on
 this.
 Number


one,
 uh
 you
 need
 a
 wall
 of
 worry.
 You


need
 people
 to
 be
 afraid.
 If
 you
 don't


have
 people
 that
 are
 afraid,
 then
 you're


not
 going to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a
 bull


market
 because
 we
 get
 too
 euphoric
 and


then
 we
 top
 out.
 I
 think
 people
 like
 Bur


coming
 out
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,
 it's
 a


bubble."
 essentially
 that's
 what
 he's


implying
 uh
 is
 bullish
 because
 you
 have


people
 that
 are
 scared
 and
 you
 need


those
 people
 that
 are
 scared
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 to
 create
 that
 wall
 of
 worry.


Number
 two,
 the
 guy
 is
 probably
 annoyed


that
 he
 missed
 it
 and
 I
 know
 he's
 had


some
 trades
 with
 Estee
 Ladar
 and
 uh
 and


Baba
 etc.
 But
 if
 you
 had
 just
 leaned
 in


to
 America
 and
 you
 know
 Bur's
 not
 a


horrible
 stock
 picker
 if
 you
 had
 picked


a
 couple
 of
 the
 Max
 7s
 he
 would
 have


been
 up
 multiple
 hundreds
 of
 percent.
 So


it's
 like
 obviously
 he's
 annoyed
 that
 he


missed
 it
 and
 it's
 like
 objectively
 you


missed
 it.
 It's
 like
 you
 missed
 it,


right?
 like
 after
 two
 years
 you
 can't


keep
 saying
 it
 it's
 it
 like
 unless
 we
 go


back
 to
 3650
 on
 the
 S&P
 and
 is
 that


possible?
 Sure.
 But
 then
 when
 you
 look


at
 the
 earnings
 growth
 that
 would
 not


make
 any
 sense,
 right?
 So
 like
 at
 its


core
 when
 you
 said
 to
 sell
 you
 didn't


anticipate
 the
 type
 of
 earnings
 growth


you
 would
 see.
 You
 didn't
 anticipate
 the


type
 of
 AI
 revolution,
 the
 capex


buildout
 we
 would
 see.
 Just
 to
 say
 all


of
 that
 over
 the
 past
 two
 and
 a
 half


years
 was
 pure
 bubble.
 I
 mean
 it
 doesn't


make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 he's


obviously
 annoyed.
 He's
 angry
 and
 as
 a


result
 he's
 now
 trying
 to
 voice
 that


frustration
 by
 telling
 everybody,
 hey,


it's
 time
 to
 sell
 and
 you
 should
 uh
 you


should
 be
 scared
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 market.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 bullish


signal
 because
 again,
 you
 need
 people
 to


be
 afraid
 and
 worried
 in
 order
 to
 get


that
 type
 of
 momentum
 that
 really
 takes


us
 higher.
 And
 so
 I
 wouldn't
 read
 too


much
 into
 it,
 but
 nonetheless,
 you
 do


have
 Bur
 coming
 out
 and
 he's
 kind
 of


implying
 there's
 not
 much
 to
 do
 in
 this


market
 other
 than
 stay
 on
 the
 sidelines,


which
 is
 fair,
 but
 then
 you
 see
 Amazon's


earnings.
 It's
 like,
 do
 you
 really
 want


to
 be
 on
 the
 sidelines
 when
 Jassis
 is


going
 to
 accelerate
 growth
 at
 20%.
 For


AWS?


Maybe
 not.


Maybe
 not.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Uh,


he
 was
 right
 once.
 Yeah.
 And
 look,
 you


got
 to
 give
 him
 this
 credit.
 He
 called


the
 housing
 bubble.
 And
 Big
 Short
 is
 one


of
 my
 favorite
 movies
 ever.
 It's
 I
 know


I
 don't
 watch
 a
 lot
 of
 movies.
 This


movie
 I've
 actually
 seen
 like
 four
 or


five
 times.
 I
 I
 like
 that
 the
 entire


story
 has
 fascinated
 me
 and
 he
 got
 it


right.
 But
 it's
 also
 like
 just
 because


you
 get
 one
 thing
 right
 does
 like
 the


reason
 we
 we
 look
 up
 to
 Buffett
 and
 Aman


and
 Drum
 Miller
 is
 because
 they
 have
 a


consistent
 career
 of
 being
 right
 over


and
 over.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 all
 those
 guys


go
 long.
 It's
 really
 hard
 to
 be
 short


and
 be
 consistently
 right
 for
 a
 career


because
 stocks
 tend
 to
 go
 up
 over
 time


because
 companies
 can
 perform
 and
 the


best
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 tend
 to
 keep


performing.
 So,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 getting


one
 thing
 right
 is
 not
 really
 the
 reason


for
 why
 you
 should
 assume
 every
 time


they
 are
 bearish.
 They
 could
 be
 right.


But
 nonetheless,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 for


for
 Bur


Mitsaw
 movie.
 No
 way.
 Dude,
 I
 actually


love
 that
 movie.
 Like,
 I
 legit
 love
 it's


any
 stock
 market
 movie.
 Like,
 I
 it
 keeps


my
 attention.
 And
 so,
 that
 was
 a
 good


one.
 Um,


do
 we
 have
 some
 new
 pictures?
 Yeah,
 we


have
 some
 new
 pictures.
 Look
 at
 that.


Even
 Tony
 Stark
 would
 be
 proud
 on


Halloween.
 This
 is
 awesome.
 I
 love
 it.


Look
 at
 that,
 dude.
 I
 love
 Halloween
 so


much.
 I
 love
 it
 so
 much.
 It's
 been
 such


a
 such
 a
 busy
 week.
 But
 there
 you
 go.


You
 got
 Mr.
 Iron
 Man
 for
 his
 birthday


today.
 Ah,
 Tyler,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 great,


Tyler.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 your
 daughter.


This
 is
 This
 is
 great.
 I
 love
 it.


Look
 at
 that.
 So
 much
 fun,
 dude.
 so
 much


fun.
 Do
 you
 guys
 know
 like
 my
 mom


because
 I
 was
 born
 on
 October
 uh
 27th.


My
 mom
 dressed
 me
 up
 uh
 for
 Halloween
 on


October
 31st
 when
 I
 was
 four
 days
 old.
 I


I
 should
 see
 if
 I
 can
 try
 to
 get
 that


picture.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 get
 my
 mom
 to


send
 to
 me.
 But
 I
 was
 in
 a
 Halloween


baby
 contest
 um
 when
 I
 was
 four
 years


old
 in
 1997.
 So
 that
 I
 feel
 like


Halloween's
 been
 ingrained
 in
 me
 for
 so


like
 literally
 at
 four
 days
 old
 my
 mom


decided
 to
 dress
 me
 up
 and
 put
 me
 in


that
 this
 goes
 to
 like
 it
 shows
 it
 goes


to
 prove
 how
 creative
 my
 mom
 is.
 Like


you
 would
 think,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 popped


out.
 Maybe
 I
 need
 to
 chill
 for
 a
 couple


days.
 Nope.
 Put
 him
 in
 a
 costume.
 We
 got


a
 Halloween
 baby
 competition
 coming
 up.


And
 so
 I've
 always
 loved
 the
 holiday.


It's
 just
 been
 such
 a
 busy
 week.
 But


crazy
 crazy.
 Tess
 says,
 "I've
 dressed
 my


babies
 up
 ever
 since
 they
 were
 born,


too."
 Yeah.
 See,
 like
 some
 moms
 they


love
 it.
 Some
 moms
 they
 love
 it.
 A
 This


is
 great.
 This
 is
 Andy's
 kid.
 Look
 at


that.
 We
 got
 Mario.


We
 got
 Mario.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Andy.
 That's


his
 little
 boy.
 I
 love
 it.
 That's


awesome.
 That
 is
 awesome.
 All right.
 So,


uh,
 we
 talked
 about
 Amazon.
 We
 talked


about
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 and
 Bur.
 Let's


talk
 about
 Jensen.
 So,
 the
 videos
 I'm


about
 to
 show
 you
 are
 going
 to
 scream


Toppoy,
 but
 you
 just
 have
 to
 remember


it's
 freaking
 Jensen
 and
 he
 gets
 to
 do


what
 he
 wants
 because
 he's
 Jensen.
 So,


let's
 start
 off
 with
 a
 couple
 of
 these


videos.
 First
 of
 all,
 uh
 this
 is
 Jensen


with
 the
 CEO
 of
 Samsung
 and
 Hyundai


uh
 doing
 shots


while
 putting
 while
 locking
 each
 other's


arms.
 You
 guys
 have
 ever
 done
 that


before
 where
 you
 take
 a
 shot
 and
 you


like
 you
 you you
 put
 your
 arm
 in
 someone


else's
 arm.
 So,
 he's
 in
 Korea
 and
 uh


that
 that's
 Jensen
 taking
 a
 drink.
 So,


that's
 the
 first
 video.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that


was
 kind
 of
 cool,
 kind
 of
 fun.
 Jensen


having
 a
 good
 time.
 The
 next
 video
 right


here
 is
 uh
 well,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.


>> Anybody
 else
 Nvidia
 investors?


>> That's
 why
 Korea
 so
 rich.


So
 you
 got
 Jensen
 in
 Korea
 talking
 to
 a


crowd
 of
 people
 saying,
 "Is
 anyone


investors?"
 And
 then
 that
 same
 crowd


responded
 by
 showing
 off
 their
 phones


with
 Nvidia
 stock
 price.


>> Look
 at
 that.
 Look
 at
 that.


Look
 at
 that.


You
 could
 tell
 Justin
 uh
 Jensen's
 having


such
 a
 good
 time.
 Like
 people
 in
 a
 crowd


are
 treating
 him
 like
 a
 rockstar.


They're
 pulling
 up
 their
 phone
 to
 show


their
 stock
 prices
 of
 Nvidia.
 AND


JENSEN'S
 LIKE,
 "WOW,
 look
 at
 that.
 Look


at
 that.
 Look
 at
 the
 stock.
 Look
 what


it's
 doing."
 I
 mean,
 obviously
 it
 feels


kind
 of
 toppy,
 but
 nonetheless,
 Nvidia


has
 been
 putting
 up
 the
 growth.
 And
 I


think
 Jensen
 deserves
 to
 be
 able
 to
 bask


in
 the
 glory
 of
 this
 moment
 and
 have


this
 much
 fun
 because
 he's
 made
 people


filthy
 rich.
 And
 that's
 why
 it's
 very


exciting.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 if
 people
 don't


know
 about
 South
 Korea,
 and
 I
 found
 this


out
 actually
 over
 the
 past
 couple


months,
 South
 Korea
 is
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 countries
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 not


only
 investing,
 but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 two


things,
 option
 trading


and
 DGEN
 investing.
 When
 I
 mean
 DGEN


investing,
 I
 mean
 communities
 that
 form


in
 South
 Korea
 that
 uh
 come
 together
 to


be
 able
 to
 bet
 on
 a
 stock
 has
 happened


for
 various
 companies
 over
 the
 past


really
 decade
 and
 it's
 only


accelerating.
 Nvidia
 being
 one
 of
 them.


The
 latest
 example
 is
 Openoro.
 There
 is


a
 massive
 open
 door
 community
 in
 South


Korea.
 They
 did
 the
 same
 with
 Tesla
 back


in
 2014.
 They
 did
 the
 same
 with


Palunteer.
 They've
 obviously
 done
 the


same
 with
 Nvidia.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


option
 stats,
 so
 one
 of
 the
 high
 I
 think


South
 Korea
 is
 number
 four
 in
 the
 top


five
 countries
 that
 trade
 options
 every


day.
 India
 is
 in
 that
 top
 five.


Obviously,
 the
 United
 States
 is
 up
 there


and
 then
 South
 Korea
 is
 up
 there.
 So,


you've
 got
 the
 Koreans
 that
 really
 do


have
 a
 culture.
 There's
 also
 a
 very


heavy
 culture
 of
 gambling
 in
 South


Korea.
 I
 think
 I
 showed
 you
 guys
 a
 video


a
 while
 ago
 of
 like
 this
 like
 this
 like


futures
 trading
 event
 almost.
 It
 was


like
 a
 esports
 event,
 but
 people
 were


trading
 futures
 and
 there
 was
 like
 a


there's
 like
 an
 audience
 of
 500
 people


in
 the
 room
 that
 were
 watching
 it
 happen


live.
 Yeah,
 Terra
 Luna.
 I
 mean,
 there's


a
 massive
 culture
 of
 South
 Korean


investors
 and
 they
 like
 to
 take
 risks.


Call
 it
 DGEN,
 call
 it,
 you
 know,
 uh,


risk
 takers,
 call
 it
 whatever
 you
 want


to
 talk,
 call
 it
 whatever
 you
 want
 to


call
 it.
 But
 they
 enjoy
 the
 process
 of


allocating
 capital
 and
 seeing
 if
 there's


a
 thesis
 towards
 something.
 And
 when
 you


have
 a
 transformational
 company
 like
 an


Nvidia
 put
 up
 the
 numbers
 that
 they
 do,


you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 investors


come
 from
 South
 Korea
 and
 be
 excited


about
 it.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 Jensen
 that
 is


in
 South
 Korea.
 Now,
 why
 is
 he
 in
 South


Korea?
 Well,
 he's
 signing
 some
 deals
 and


he's
 talking
 to
 the
 media
 in
 South
 Korea


and,
 you
 know,
 continuing
 to
 make
 the


argument
 for
 why
 Nvidia
 deserves
 to
 be


at
 the
 spot
 that
 it
 is.
 He's
 making
 a


couple
 of
 deals
 with
 SKH
 Heinix
 and


Samsung.
 Here's
 what
 he
 was
 uh
 answering


when
 he
 was
 asked
 about
 Blackwell
 going


to
 China.


>> Mr.
 Jensen,
 do
 you
 talk
 about
 selling


chips
 to
 China?


>> No,
 we
 were
 just
 mostly
 talking
 about


enjoying
 each
 other's
 enjoying
 each


other's
 company.
 Thank
 you.
 Will
 you
 be


um
 selling
 techniques
 to
 China?


>> Uh
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 hope
 so
 someday.


>> Okay.


>> I
 hope
 so
 someday.
 I
 think
 it's
 really


good
 for
 America
 and
 it's
 really
 good


for
 China
 that
 Nvidia
 could
 uh


participate
 in
 the
 Chinese
 market,


>> but
 no
 decisions
 have
 been
 made
 and
 uh


uh
 you
 know,
 we'll
 see
 how
 it
 turns
 out.


I
 hope
 it
 turns
 out
 well.
 total.
 This


week,
 we
 announced
 that
 we
 will
 build


250,000
 more
 GPUs
 here
 in
 Korea,
 making


Korea
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 GPU
 or
 AI


infrastructure
 countries
 in
 the
 world.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 build
 50,000
 GPU
 AI


factories
 with
 Samsung.
 Working
 with
 SK,


the
 SK
 group,
 of
 course,
 with
 HPM


memory,
 but
 also
 in
 creating
 digital


twins
 of
 their
 factories.
 and
 we're


going
 to
 build
 50,000
 GPU
 AI
 factories


with
 uh
 SK
 group
 uh
 for
 their
 AI


factories.


>> So
 the
 overall
 deal
 is
 summarized
 right


here.
 Uh
 Nvidia
 will
 ship
 260,000
 GPUs.


Samsung
 will
 get
 50,000
 GPUs
 for
 its
 new


AI
 factory.
 SK
 Group
 50,000
 then


Navercloud
 50,000.
 Samsung
 already


manufactures
 all
 of
 its
 Nvidia's


robotics
 processor.
 So
 the
 reason
 he


went
 to
 South
 Korea
 was
 to
 really


solidify
 these
 deals.
 And
 it
 looks
 like


this
 was
 a
 successful
 trip.
 By
 the
 way,


we
 got a
 headline
 from
 Amazon.
 Amazon


robotics
 team
 is
 working
 towards


automating
 75%
 of
 the
 company's
 entire


operations
 and
 expects
 to
 ditch
 160,000


US
 roles
 that
 would
 otherwise
 be
 needed


by
 2027.


That's
 from
 Bloomberg
 right
 there.
 That


is
 likely
 in
 the
 factories,
 not


corporate,
 because
 I
 don't
 even
 think


there
 are
 160,000
 people
 that
 work
 in


corporate
 for
 Amazon.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 this
 is
 going
 to


help
 Amazon
 stock
 and
 this
 is
 what
 we've


been
 talking
 about.
 It's
 like
 no
 one


wants
 to
 see
 the
 layoffs
 hop
 happen.


Obviously,
 everyone
 feels
 bad
 for


someone
 losing
 their
 job,
 but
 the
 one


way
 to
 protect
 yourself
 is
 to
 own
 the


asset
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 that
 is


benefiting
 from
 it.
 Now,
 as
 a
 society,


how
 do
 we
 deal
 with
 all
 those
 job


losses?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Uh
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 intricate
 problem
 for


us
 to
 deal
 with
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 But


the
 asset
 share,
 the
 asset
 holders
 are


going
 to
 benefit
 when
 margins
 go
 up.
 And


if
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 ready
 to


automate,


you
 got
 to
 own
 the
 asset.
 Not
 to
 mention


robotics.
 Again,
 we
 don't
 talk
 about
 it


enough.
 This
 is
 a
 major
 tailwind
 for


Amazon
 and
 they
 didn't
 talk
 about
 it
 too


much
 on
 the
 call,
 but
 that
 is
 something


that
 we
 can't
 ignore
 as
 a
 moat
 for
 the


company
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 So,
 you
 got


Amazon
 right
 there
 at
 253.
 Another
 video


by
 Jensen.
 Here's
 him
 throwing
 the
 Biden


administration
 under
 the
 bus
 in
 regards


to
 their
 China
 business.


>> China
 sales
 be
 with
 the
 export


restrictions
 or
 without
 the
 export


restrictions?


>> Well,
 Nvidia
 had
 95%
 of
 the
 China


market.
 Today,
 we
 have
 0%.
 Um,
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 Biden
 administration,


we
 had
 95%.


And
 the
 the
 um
 uh
 the
 policies
 of
 that


administration
 u
 really
 caused
 us
 to


lose
 practically
 the
 entire
 uh
 China


market.
 Um
 I
 I
 would
 guess
 that
 China
 is


probably
 something
 like,
 you
 know,
 35
 to


50
 billion
 dollars
 a
 year
 to
 us
 if
 we're


fully
 in
 that
 market
 today.
 and
 and
 uh


uh
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 decade
 it's


probably
 you
 know
 well
 over
 a hundred


billion
 dollars.
 It's
 quite
 substantial


but
 at
 the
 moment
 it's
 zero.
 We're


forecasting
 zero.
 We're
 expecting
 zero.


We're
 hoping
 for
 nonzero
 but
 we're


expecting
 zero.
 And
 um
 uh
 we'll
 do
 our


best
 and
 continue
 to
 continue
 to
 grow


the
 company.
 You
 know
 of
 course
 around


the
 world
 the
 opportunity
 is
 really


quite
 substantial.
 We're
 going
 through
 a


platform
 shift
 from
 the
 old
 way
 of
 doing


computing
 to
 this
 new
 way,
 Nvidia's
 way


of
 doing
 accelerated
 computing
 and
 AI.


We're
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 that
 the


decade
 journey
 of
 building
 out
 uh
 this


infrastructure.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


really
 a
 lot
 of
 growth
 uh
 with
 or


without
 China,
 but
 the
 China
 market
 is


very
 special.
 We
 we
 um
 we
 don't
 take
 it


for
 granted
 and
 it
 would
 be
 really


helpful
 that
 we're
 in
 there.


So
 obviously
 Jensen's
 playing
 to
 Trump,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 love
 it
 or
 hate
 it,


he
 is
 very
 smart
 about
 this.
 And
 when


Trump
 hears
 those
 quotes,
 he
 is
 going
 to


be
 happy
 knowing
 that
 Jensen
 is
 blaming


the
 Biden
 administration.
 But
 I
 think


the
 biggest
 bullish
 takeaway
 from
 that


for
 Nvidia
 is
 that
 again,
 everything


that
 they
 said
 this
 week,
 I
 mean,
 dude,


I
 forgot
 Nvidia
 had
 GTC
 this
 week.
 That


was
 that's
 another
 thing
 that
 made
 this


week
 so
 crazy.
 Uh,
 everything
 doesn't


assume
 China
 revenue.
 None
 of
 it.
 And
 so


when
 you're
 being
 as
 bullish
 as
 Jensen


is
 with
 no
 China
 revenue,


I
 mean
 again,
 if
 they
 add
 any
 bit
 of


that
 China
 guidance,
 it
 just
 continues


to
 make
 the
 stock
 look
 not
 that


expensive,
 which
 is
 pretty
 bullish.
 So


you
 got
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 at
 20662.


Palenteer,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 shot
 we
 see


200
 today.
 We're
 at
 199.
 Got
 very
 close


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 We're
 going to
 see


when
 the
 market
 opens
 if
 the
 momentum
 is


there.
 But
 uh
 pounder
 right
 there


199.14.
 Where
 is
 Rocklab
 premarkets?
 We


are
 at
 6175.


ESTs
 we're
 at
 77.86.
 All
 those
 are


green.
 Iran
 that's
 at
 6125.


Uh
 where
 is
 Lemonade?
 We
 are
 at
 5966.


UNH
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce


yesterday.
 Wow.
 Goes
 down.
 All right.
 So


C
 A
 Sigma
 couple
 and
 Molina
 a
 couple


different
 healthcare
 companies
 not
 doing


the
 best
 over
 the
 past
 four
 days.I


United
 Health
 was
 almost
 at
 390
 on


Tuesday.
 So
 that
 one
 definitely
 took
 a


hit.
 And
 then
 Oscar
 right
 there
 1823.


Uh,
 Reddit
 crushed
 it
 as
 well.
 So,


Reddit
 was
 weird,
 dude.
 There
 was
 a


hilarious
 video
 of
 Tanner.
 If
 you
 were


watching
 Tanner
 stream,
 Tanner
 for
 the


first
 time
 did
 a
 earnings
 trade
 and
 I


know
 Tanner
 pretty
 well.
 He
 never
 does


earnings
 trades.
 He's
 always
 very
 cons
 I


mean,
 the
 guy
 would
 barely
 get
 into


options
 and
 selling
 a
 covered
 call
 for


like
 the
 past
 10
 years
 as
 an
 investor.


And
 so,
 he
 doesn't
 do
 earnings
 trades.


And
 I
 think
 Reddit
 at
 like
 195
 or


whatever.
 He
 took
 he
 took
 the
 trade
 and


then
 the
 stock
 goes
 to
 the
 moon.
 Then
 it


goes
 all
 the
 way
 back
 down
 and
 he
 starts


apologizing.
 He's
 like, "Guys,
 this
 is


why
 I
 don't
 do
 earnings
 trades.
 Don't


follow
 me.
 I'm
 a
 horrible
 person."
 And


then
 the
 stock
 shoots
 back
 up
 and
 he's


like,
 "Screw
 you
 guys.
 I
 was
 right.
 I


knew
 Reddit
 would
 go
 up."
 And
 it
 was
 the


funniest
 thing
 ever.
 But
 it
 was
 great
 to


see
 the
 roller
 coaster
 of
 emotions
 uh


from
 Mr.
 Tanner
 on
 Reddit.
 Uh
 Reddit


deserves
 it,
 dude.
 These
 guys
 are


crushing
 it.
 These
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 a


growth
 company,
 these
 guys
 are
 freaking


growing.
 And
 it's
 pretty
 incredible
 to


see.
 68%
 year-over-year
 growth.
 Gross


margins
 at
 91%.
 Profitable
 adjusted
 IBA


has
 a
 40%
 margin.
 Operating
 cash
 flow


185
 million.
 Daily
 active
 uniques
 up
 20%


year-over-year
 to
 116
 million.


I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 never
 love
 the
 valuation


of
 Reddit,
 especially
 when
 it
 started


getting
 into
 the
 high
 100s
 and
 I
 kind
 of


forgot
 about
 it.
 I
 had
 it
 at
 106,
 110,


got
 out
 of
 it
 at
 like
 120,
 125,
 but
 they


are
 able
 to
 grow
 and
 it
 doesn't
 look


like
 they're
 slowing
 down.
 There's
 also


an
 argument
 that
 there's
 an
 AI
 moat
 to


Reddit
 that
 is
 very
 undervalued
 in


regards
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 do
 have,


you
 know,
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 people


every
 week
 come
 to
 the
 platform
 and


create
 content.
 That
 content
 can
 be


trained
 on
 large
 language
 models.
 And
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 there's
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 different
 proprietary
 stuff
 Reddit


can
 do,
 but
 the
 core
 advertising


business
 is
 growing
 and
 it's
 growing


really
 well.
 So,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 in


Reddit,
 I
 don't
 see
 those
 earnings
 as
 a


reason
 to
 sell.
 Now,
 it
 it
 is
 high
 beta,


so
 you
 got
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 volatility


of
 it,
 but
 like
 it
 does
 feel
 like


Reddit's
 going to
 be
 a
 larger
 company


five
 years
 from
 now.


So,
 it's
 not
 the
 worst
 long-term
 hold
 to


uh
 to
 have
 on
 Reddit.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we


got
 on
 Reddit.
 Earnings
 this
 morning.


So,
 all
 the
 earnings
 yesterday
 after


Well,
 let
 me
 show
 you
 guys
 this
 real


quick.
 Coinbase
 also
 crushed
 on


earnings,
 but
 uh
 they
 beat
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom.
 Incredible
 revenue


numbers.
 Guidance
 was
 good.
 Subscription


revenue
 was
 good.
 I
 mean,
 Coinbase


really
 did
 crush
 it.
 And
 it's
 one
 of


those
 names
 that
 I
 know
 it's
 tied
 to


Bitcoin,
 but
 like
 just
 as
 a
 business,


they
 are
 absolutely
 crushing
 it.
 Pretty


much
 every
 company
 yesterday
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 had
 a
 really
 good
 job.


The
 headline
 on
 Coinbase
 though
 was
 this


that
 happened
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 call
 and


I'm
 just
 curious
 what
 is
 your
 gut


reaction
 when
 you
 hear
 this
 because
 I


was
 a
 bit
 mixed
 when
 I
 saw
 this
 happen


>> on
 that.
 Um
 I
 was
 a
 little
 distracted


because
 I
 was
 tracking
 the
 prediction


market
 about
 what
 Coinbase
 will
 say
 on


their
 next
 earnings
 call
 and
 I
 just
 want


to
 you
 know
 add
 here
 the
 words
 Bitcoin,


Ethereum,
 blockchain
 staking


and
 web
 3
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 get
 those
 in


before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 call.


Okay,
 so


look,
 I
 think
 Brian
 Armstrong
 is


incredible
 and
 I
 genuinely
 think
 he
 was


in
 the
 earnings
 call
 and
 someone
 in
 the


Slack
 probably
 sent
 the
 link
 of
 the
 Kali


marketplace
 for
 what
 will
 Brian


Armstrong
 say
 and
 he
 just
 had
 fun
 with


it
 and
 he
 really
 wasn't
 like
 thinking


that
 deeply
 about
 it.
 But
 dude,
 that
 is


sus.
 That
 is
 so
 like
 the
 obvious
 thing


people
 think
 about
 is
 who
 does
 he
 know


that
 is
 has
 trades
 which
 whoever
 knows


how
 much
 money
 what
 if
 it's
 like
 a


million
 dollars
 on
 if
 Brian
 Armstrong
 is


going
 to
 say
 the
 word
 stable
 coin
 and


then
 boom
 he
 does
 his
 buddy
 a
 favor
 says


the
 word
 stable
 coin
 and
 then
 and
 that


guy
 just
 made
 some
 money.
 Now
 did
 that


actually
 happen?
 I
 really
 don't
 think


so.
 I
 this
 guy
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 he's


Brian
 freaking
 Armstrong.
 He's
 not


worried
 about
 saying
 a
 word
 so
 that


someone
 can
 make
 money
 from
 a


prediction.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 it
 was


just
 him
 just
 having
 fun
 with
 it.
 But


the
 perception
 was
 so
 bad
 in
 my
 opinion


like
 and
 and
 I'm
 not
 the
 guy
 to
 nitpick


like
 that.
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 I
 I
 tend
 to
 be


on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 CEO
 and
 the
 founder.


Brian
 Armstrong's
 the
 founder.
 I
 don't


want
 to
 nitpick
 on
 something
 this


stupid.
 But
 I
 just
 like
 even
 me
 I'm
 just


like
 dude
 that's
 just
 weird,
 bro.
 You
 do


something
 like
 that
 and
 people
 start


thinking
 and
 they
 get
 all
 these


conspiracy
 theories.
 And
 it
 goes
 to
 show


how
 deep
 the
 gambling
 culture
 has


infiltrated
 our
 lives.
 And
 quite


frankly,
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 Brian


Armstrong
 did
 that
 is
 because,
 and
 I


heard
 this
 rumor
 a
 month
 ago,
 and
 I


don't
 know if
 it's
 going
 to
 happen,
 but


I
 feel
 like
 Coinbase
 is
 going
 to
 launch


prediction
 markets.
 Why
 wouldn't
 they?


They
 have
 the
 distribution.
 They
 have


the
 ecosystem.
 They
 have
 the
 technology.


Poly
 Market
 is
 not
 proprietary.
 It's
 not


special.
 Koshi
 is
 not
 special.
 I
 mean,


Robin
 would
 copy
 them
 immediately,


right?
 Like,
 so
 this
 stuff
 is
 very
 easy


to
 replicate.
 Uh,
 and
 there's
 a
 global


pool
 of
 liquidity
 that
 Coinbase
 would


offer
 to
 the
 prediction
 market.
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 why
 he
 did
 it
 because


they're
 trying
 to
 get
 into
 it.
 But
 it


really
 does
 show
 that
 gambling
 is
 not


going
 away
 and
 it's
 becoming
 more
 and


more
 uh
 of
 a
 part
 of
 our
 culture
 with


these
 prediction
 markets.
 So
 yeah,


that's
 the
 one
 thing
 you
 had
 from


Coinbase,
 but
 nonetheless
 outside
 of


that,
 still
 overall
 pretty
 good
 quarter.


Cloudflare,
 they
 beat
 by
 17%
 on
 EPS,


beat
 by
 3%
 on
 revenue.
 Zillow
 beat
 by


100%
 on
 EPS,
 beat
 by
 1%
 on
 revenue.


Rocket
 companies
 beat
 by
 40%
 on
 EPS,


beat
 by
 8%
 on
 revenue.
 Western
 Digital


beat
 by
 12%
 on
 EPS
 by
 3%
 on
 revenue.


Reddit
 beat
 by
 54%
 on
 EPS,
 6%
 on


revenue.
 Coinbase
 28%
 on
 EPS,
 4%
 on


revenue.
 Twilio
 17%
 EPS,
 4%
 revenue.
 At


last,
 they
 had
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom,
 24%
 on
 EPS,
 2%
 on
 revenue.
 And


then
 Roku,
 which
 didn't
 have
 the
 best


stock
 performance,
 but
 they
 beat
 by
 78%


on
 EPS
 and
 revenue
 came
 in
 line
 with


expectations.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 you're


seeing
 these
 companies
 continue
 to
 beat


and
 particularly
 beat
 on
 EPS,
 which
 is


the
 most
 important
 thing.
 And
 it's
 very,


very
 exciting.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 having
 a


really
 strong
 Q3
 earning
 cycle,
 which
 is


nice
 to
 see.
 Iran
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 bump
 right
 here.
 Robin
 getting
 a


bump
 as
 well.
 I
 don't
 know if
 there's


any
 headline.
 I'll
 see
 in
 a
 second,
 but


we
 got
 30
 seconds
 before
 the
 market


opens.
 Either
 this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


head
 fake
 and
 you
 have
 Algo
 coming
 in


and
 just
 buying
 stuff
 up.
 Micro
 Strategy


also
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 here,


or


uh
 you
 got
 people
 that
 are
 buying
 right


before
 the
 market
 opens
 today.
 So,
 here


we
 go.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 plays


out.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Happy
 Halloween.
 We
 got
 all
 eyes
 on


Amazon.
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 absolutely


crushed
 it.
 And
 big
 win
 for
 the
 entire


community.
 Big
 win
 this
 week
 forever
 for


all
 stock
 market
 investors.
 And
 now
 we


just
 got
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 end
 out
 this


Friday.
 I
 will
 be
 on
 the
 market
 close


today.
 Not
 going
 to
 miss
 my
 job
 today.


>> I'll
 be
 live
 and
 we'll
 see
 what
 we
 got


to
 do.
 9:30
 a.m.
 Halloween.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 snack


market
 is
 now
 open.


All


right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Amazon
 24944,


loses
 250,
 but
 holding
 on
 to
 an
 11%


move,
 which
 you
 can't
 be
 too
 upset


about.
 There
 you
 go.
 Amazon
 right
 there.


11.7%
 up
 on
 the
 day.
 Palunteer,
 do
 we


get
 200?
 We
 got
 200.
 We
 got
 200,
 folks.


We
 might
 as
 well
 do
 it
 right
 now.
 Ladies


and
 gentlemen,

congratulations.

 Robin

Nvidia
 up

 Tesla

 SoFi

 AMD

 S&P's
 up

half,
 Google's
 up
 1.3,
 Amazon
 11.7,
 Meta


starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of


recovery,
 PayPal's
 up,
 Apple's
 up,
 ELF


is
 up,
 SMCI
 is
 up.
 You're
 getting
 a
 move


across
 the
 board
 in
 this
 ecosystem.
 IN


6162,


that's
 up
 7%
 on
 the
 day.
 AMD
 is
 up
 1.5%.


Uh
 Google
 again
 up
 1%.
 BABA's
 down,
 the


VIX
 is
 down
 3%.
 That's
 a
 big
 move
 on
 the


VIX.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 going
 to
 get
 the


market
 to
 get
 some
 love.
 Fizer's
 flat.


Dualingo
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Lyft
 is
 up


a
 little
 bit.
 Consumer
 defensives
 are


down
 and
 tech
 is
 up.
 It
 looks
 like
 we're


getting
 a
 pretty
 big
 rotation
 on
 that


value
 to
 growth
 argument
 that
 we're


seeing
 right
 here.
 Tesla
 447.
 Now,
 I


know
 we're
 only
 one
 minute
 into
 the


market
 open,
 so
 we
 got
 to
 see
 how
 these


algos
 react.
 Google
 right
 there,
 284.


SoFi
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 30.
 Uh


pounder
 just
 under
 200
 at
 1995.
 Again,


we
 got
 that
 $200
 30
 level.
 BMR,
 which


did
 take
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 dump
 yesterday,
 4598


from
 47.
 So
 that's
 down
 from
 the


pre-market.
 It
 did
 hit
 44
 at
 one
 point


yesterday.
 So
 BMR
 um
 obviously
 did
 get


hit
 as
 Ethereum
 got
 hit.
 Ethereum
 right


here,
 are
 we
 still
 at
 3,800?
 We
 are
 at


3850
 on
 Ethereum.
 And
 then
 Bitcoin


trying
 to
 get
 a
 move
 at
 10,964.
 You're


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 that
 are


just
 running
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market
 opens


on
 this
 Friday.
 Look
 at
 Reddit.
 17%
 move


on
 a
 Reddit.
 Congrats
 to
 everyone
 who


has
 that
 one.
 Meta
 not
 really
 able
 to


hold
 up.
 6
 I
 did
 buy
 Meta
 yesterday
 for


those
 that
 missed
 the
 market
 close
 at


659.
 659
 I
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 a


nibble
 at
 Meta.
 Have
 not
 really
 made
 it


into
 a
 real
 position
 yet,
 but
 659
 is


when
 I
 bought
 bounced
 up
 all
 the
 way
 to


680
 yesterday
 right
 here
 at
 668.
 The
 25


billion
 of
 bonds
 that
 Meta
 offered,
 uh,


there
 was


125
 billion
 of
 demand
 for
 those
 25


billions
 of
 bonds,
 which
 is
 quite


incredible.
 And
 so
 you
 did
 have
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 get
 excited
 about
 that.
 Wow.


pound
 here.
 200.72


200.72.


We
 got
 the
 earnings
 on
 Monday.
 We
 did


hit
 200
 a
 couple
 days
 ago
 overnight.
 Uh


this
 is
 the
 first
 time
 we're
 hitting
 it


as
 the
 market
 is
 open
 again.
 It's
 pretty


incredible
 to
 see
 that
 two
 handle
 on
 it.


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 knew
 it
 was
 going
 to


happen
 eventually
 and
 as
 we
 inched
 up
 to


that
 $200
 handle,
 here
 we
 are.
 Uh
 we


just
 broke
 201.
 We
 just
 broke
 2011


on
 pound
 here.
 That
 is
 incredible,
 dude.


That
 is
 absolutely
 incredible.
 I'll


check
 resistance
 for
 202,
 but
 2045.


Someone's
 buying
 heavy.
 Someone
 is


buying
 heavy.
 202
 resistance
 is
 20,000


shares.
 20,000
 shares.
 There's
 not
 a
 ton


of
 resistance.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 at


206.
 Amazon,
 are
 we
 still
 holding
 250


248?
 So,
 we're
 not
 holding
 250,
 but


we're
 holding
 247,
 which
 you
 can't
 be


too
 mad
 about.
 It's
 a
 $24
 move
 on
 a


multi-tillion
 dollar
 company.
 Market
 cap


of
 Amazon
 now
 is
 2.65
 trillion.
 It
 was


2.3
 going
 into
 the
 print.
 So
 can't
 be


too
 upset.
 Micro
 Strategy
 that's
 up
 5%.


They
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 I
 think
 Micro


Strategy
 is
 just
 down
 because
 Bitcoin
 is


down.
 Hims
 up
 4%.
 AS
 up
 2%.
 Uber's
 up


1.4%.
 Where
 is
 Rocket
 Lab?
 Rocket
 Lab
 is


6150.


That
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 Uber
 again


that's
 at
 98.
 Nebus
 uh
 unfortunately


none
 of
 the
 hyperscalers
 mentioned
 any


of
 the
 smaller
 companies
 like
 a
 Nebius


Cororeweave.
 I
 mean,
 Jensen
 mentioned


that
 at
 GTC,
 but
 you
 didn't
 get
 any
 of


the
 big
 names
 say
 their
 names


explicitly,


but
 you
 would
 imagine
 that
 the


partnerships
 are
 going
 to
 be
 happening


in
 2026
 because
 all
 of
 them
 have
 said


they
 are
 computed
 and
 they're
 going
 to


need
 more
 capacity,


which
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 all
 these


companies
 are
 continuing
 to
 get


momentum.
 All
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 are
 up


except
 Hive
 and
 Riot.
 Bit
 Farms
 is
 up
 at


408,
 Marathon's
 up
 a
 little
 bit,


Galaxy's
 up
 now.
 All
 of
 these
 are
 still


down
 a
 decent
 chunk
 from
 where
 they
 were


a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 but
 nonetheless,


they
 are
 green
 and
 so
 they're
 holding
 on


to
 some
 momentum
 right
 there.
 AMD
 1.2%.


Pounding
 2011


20150.
 Wow.
 Roku
 reversed.
 Roku
 was
 down


bad
 yesterday.
 Look
 at
 that
 9%
 move
 on


Roku,
 which
 it
 didn't
 make
 sense
 when
 it


was
 down
 10%
 yesterday
 because
 they
 had


a
 pretty
 big
 beat
 on
 EPS,
 but
 you
 had


some
 knee-jerk
 reactions
 there.
 Roku


getting
 a
 move
 109.
 I
 think
 Kathy
 still


owns
 like
 a
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 the


stock.


So,
 that
 one
 is
 going
 green.
 Uh
 Jay


says,
 "I
 closed
 my
 Amazon
 debit
 spreads


for
 165%.
 Let
 me
 know
 what
 you
 did
 with


your
 Amazon,
 if
 you
 sold
 it,
 if
 you're


selling
 any
 covered
 calls,
 if
 you're


taking
 any
 profits."
 Micron
 right
 there,


230.
 That's
 I
 think
 an
 all-time
 high
 for


Micron.
 Very
 close
 to
 an
 all-time
 high.


232
 is
 an
 all-time
 high
 for
 Micron.


Where
 is
 TSM?
 TSM
 right
 there.
 Wow.
 306.


TSM
 five
 bucks
 away
 from
 its
 all-time


highs
 as
 well.
 Pound
 here
 touched
 202.


We
 touched
 it
 for
 a
 second,
 but
 we
 did


touch
 202.


We
 did
 touch
 202.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get


right
 back
 there.
 2080.
 202.
 There
 he


is.
 There
 it
 is.
 202
 on
 Palunteer.
 My


goodness.
 203
 resistance,
 by
 the
 way,
 is


8,000

8,000


shares.
 Nvidia
 at
 207.


This
 is
 incredible,
 dude.
 This
 is


absolutely
 incredible.
 Congrats
 to


everybody.
 I
 mean,


you
 know,
 it's
 just
 I
 you
 never
 know


sometimes
 when
 this
 stuff
 happens.
 And
 I


I
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks,
 I've
 been
 saying
 if
 we
 get


a
 good
 earnings
 run,
 especially
 a
 50%


growth
 quarter,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 make
 a


move
 to
 200
 after
 earnings.
 We
 got
 it


before,
 which
 begs
 the
 question,
 how


good
 does
 earnings
 have
 to
 be
 now
 to


hold
 200?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 if
 earnings


is
 lights
 out,
 are
 we
 going
 way
 higher


than
 200?
 Monday
 is
 when
 we're
 going
 to


find
 out.
 But
 my
 goodness,
 this
 is


incredible.
 You
 also
 have
 people


probably
 buying
 before
 earnings.
 You


probably
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 saying,


"Look,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 before
 earnings


because
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 crush


it."
 And
 you're
 getting
 those
 people
 to


load
 up
 right
 there.
 Circle
 up
 3%.
 App


loving
 638.
 This
 was
 at
 550
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 week.
 So,
 this
 one


making
 a
 nice
 move.
 Ethereum
 at
 3,800.


Then,
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 at
 109.7.


Nvidia
 is
 at
 207.
 Open
 Door
 is
 doing
 a


video
 earnings
 call
 for
 their
 earnings


and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hosted
 on
 Robin


Hood
 YouTube
 and
 X
 as
 well,
 but
 also
 on


Robin
 Hood.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 like
 it.
 Look,
 I
 I


don't
 own
 Open
 Door
 stock,
 but
 I
 really


like
 this
 new
 CEO.
 I
 think
 he's
 really


motivated
 to
 care
 about
 retail


investors,
 and
 I
 like
 that
 they're
 doing


a
 video
 call.
 So,
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 that


from
 Open
 Door,
 and
 their
 earnings,
 I


think,
 will
 be
 next
 week
 as
 well.
 And
 we


are
 going
 to
 see


uh
 Meta
 is
 not
 getting
 any
 love.
 That
 is


correct.
 Now
 again,
 I
 think
 that's
 where


the
 opportunity
 is.
 You've
 got
 to
 really


understand
 the
 thesis
 here
 to
 bet
 on


meta,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 opportunity
 is


where
 you're
 not
 getting
 love.
 Steve
 and


I
 were
 talking
 about
 this
 last
 night,


but
 there's
 not
 many
 opportunities
 where


a
 hyperscaler
 that
 has
 a
 moat
 that
 is


hard
 to
 be
 replicated.
 I
 mean,
 one
 could


say
 impossible
 to
 be
 replicated
 gives


you
 a
 15%
 decline.
 Like,
 you
 just
 don't


see
 that
 too
 often.
 And
 Meta
 is
 giving


it
 to
 you.
 So,
 the
 question
 is,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 where
 you
 got
 to
 put
 in


the
 hard
 work
 as
 an
 investor
 to
 say,
 is


it
 worth
 taking
 that
 risk?
 I
 do
 think
 a


year
 from
 now
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that


upset
 at
 Meta.
 PayPal
 right
 there,


that's
 basically
 flat.
 ELF
 is
 up
 a


little
 bit
 and
 then
 Apple
 goes
 red.


Apple
 goes
 red.
 Did
 get
 to
 285,


but
 then
 Apple


goes
 red.
 Brandon,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 Uh,
 right
 covered
 calls
 today
 on


pound
 chair
 for
 maximum
 share
 retention


but
 decent
 premium.
 Where
 would
 you
 be


looking?
 So,
 I
 would
 be
 looking
 a
 month


out
 and
 I'd
 probably
 be
 looking
 at
 230,


240.
 I
 wouldn't
 go
 210,
 215,
 220.
 I
 know


the
 premiums
 are
 super
 juicy
 and
 you


probably
 want
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 I
 would
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 give
 Palanteer
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 doubt
 every
 time
 they've


crushed
 on
 earnings.
 And
 if
 it
 if
 it


goes
 down
 on
 earnings,
 you
 can
 roll
 it


down,
 right?
 So
 you
 can
 still
 collect


some
 premium
 on
 the
 downside
 if
 you
 go


from
 like
 230
 to
 210.
 But
 I
 wouldn't


risk
 it
 by
 being
 super
 aggressive
 on


earnings
 even
 though
 the
 stock
 has
 made


a
 move
 already.
 So
 yeah,
 I'd
 probably
 go


a
 month
 out
 around
 240


and
 that's
 where
 I
 would
 write
 those


covered
 calls.
 Um,
 pounder
 still
 202.


Did
 you
 invest
 in
 OpenAI?
 No,
 I
 invest


in
 Nvidia.
 So,
 I
 guess
 by
 proxy
 I
 have


some
 allocation
 in
 OpenAI,
 but
 I
 do
 not


have
 a
 direct
 investment
 in
 open
 eye.


AMD
 right
 there
 259.
 S&P
 still
 green
 on


the
 day
 as
 well.
 Up
 half
 a
 percent.
 So,


it's
 not
 like
 the
 S&P
 isn't
 moving
 with


this.
 BABA
 is
 dumping.
 Not
 sure
 why.
 I


mean,
 not
 really
 dumping,
 but
 it's
 down


2%.


You
 are
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hit


right
 there.
 By
 the
 way,
 SpaceX,

 reported,

 Tesla

 to

 458
 or

 right
 here


on
 Tessy.
 Uh
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 moving
 up.
 Lumen
 did
 drop
 from
 11.


That
 is
 correct.
 Uh
 where's
 gold
 right


now?
 Gold
 is
 still
 back
 above
 4,000.
 By


the
 way,
 this
 10
 year
 is
 not
 really


cooperating.
 Um
 it's
 down
 a
 little


today,
 but
 it
 it
 was
 at
 4.1
 yesterday.


We
 kind
 of
 need
 these
 bond
 yields
 to
 go


down.
 So
 even
 with
 the
 rate
 cut,
 you're


not
 necessarily
 seeing
 a
 decent
 move
 on


bond
 yields
 going
 down.


But
 you
 know,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 one


could
 say
 that
 they're
 selling
 bond


yields
 to
 to
 buy
 stocks
 or
 selling
 bonds


to
 buy
 stocks,
 which
 is
 causing
 yields


to
 go
 higher.
 Uh
 we
 are
 still
 in
 fear.


We
 are
 still
 in
 fear.
 Wow.
 So
 we
 were
 at


neutral
 at
 690
 on
 or
 689
 on
 the
 S&P.


We're
 at
 684.
 So
 that
 1%
 decline
 is


causing
 36
 level
 on
 fear
 whereas
 we
 were


at
 neutral
 before.


But
 so
 far
 we're
 still
 on
 fear.
 UNH


getting
 wrecked
 I
 guess
 by

 That


one

 to

 That's


down.
 Pounder
 Weekly
 will
 be
 tonight
 at


11:00
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 11:00
 p.m.
 Eastern


tonight.
 Marll.
 Okay,
 so
 Marll
 has
 a


very
 close
 relationship
 with
 Amazon,
 uh,


or
 at least
 has
 been
 rumored
 to
 have
 a


very
 close
 relationship
 with
 Amazon,


especially
 on
 the
 tranium
 chips.
 Marll


right
 there,
 9454.
 I
 think
 it's
 running


because
 of
 Amazon's
 outstanding
 demand


for
 Tranium.
 I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 my


argument
 for
 why
 it's
 making
 a
 move,
 but


that's
 what
 you're
 seeing
 right
 now
 on


Tranium.


Uh,
 and
 that's
 why
 it
 likely
 is
 going


green.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 chart,
 by
 the


way.
 I
 mean,
 speaking
 of
 resilience
 in


the
 S&P
 500,
 the
 S&P
 has
 traded
 above


its
 50-day
 moving
 average
 for
 125


consecutive
 sessions.
 The
 longest
 streak


since
 2011


when
 it
 lasted
 130
 sessions.
 This
 is
 the


third
 long
 longest
 stretch
 this
 century.


The
 longest
 run
 since
 2000
 was
 149


sessions,
 which
 ended
 in
 February
 2007,


which
 was
 the
 Great
 Recession.
 Before


that,
 the
 index
 remained
 above
 its


50-day
 moving
 average
 for
 257


consecutive
 trading
 days
 from
 January
 95


to
 January
 96,
 the
 longest
 streak
 since


1928.
 The
 S&P
 500
 is
 also
 trading
 13%


above
 its
 200
 day
 moving
 average,
 the


widest
 gap
 since
 July
 2024.
 I
 mean,


again,
 when
 you
 when
 you
 see
 people


scream
 bubble,
 you
 also
 got
 to
 realize


just
 the
 resilience
 of
 this
 market
 and


why
 every
 dip
 is
 getting
 bought
 because


there's
 not
 that
 many
 opportunities
 to


get
 allocation
 to
 these
 dips.
 And
 so


when
 they
 give
 it
 to
 you,
 people
 start


buying.
 Wow,
 Hoodie.
 Hoodie
 also
 has


earnings
 next
 week.
 She's
 trying
 to
 go


back
 to
 150
 147


on
 Mr.
 Robin
 Hood.
 Tesla
 right
 there


449.
 Nvidia
 206
 then
 Palanteer
 just


under
 202.
 Would
 you
 sell
 Amazon?
 No,
 I


would
 not
 sell
 Amazon
 at
 least.
 Look,


here's
 my
 thing.
 Could
 Amazon
 go
 back


down
 to
 like
 220,
 230?
 Yes.
 I
 mean,


we're
 probably
 going
 to
 get
 some
 level


of
 correction
 in
 26
 and
 maybe
 get
 these


prices
 again
 that
 we
 had
 over
 the
 past


month.
 But
 I
 I
 do
 think
 Amazon
 can


become
 a
 cornerstone
 of
 a
 portfolio


where
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 too
 worried


about
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 we've
 done
 enough


work
 in
 terms
 of
 analyzing
 the
 company


over
 the
 past
 two
 months
 to
 realize
 this


is
 a
 dip
 by
 if
 it
 ever
 gives
 you
 a
 dip


and
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 hold
 on
 to
 it
 over


the
 next
 10
 years
 as
 Amazon
 continues
 to


become
 the
 behemoth
 that
 it
 is.
 So
 and


and
 from
 a
 numbers
 perspective
 again
 if


they
 can
 increase
 their
 margins
 to
 20%


they
 have
 200
 billion
 in
 operating


income.
 You
 know
 you
 likely
 have
 closer


to
 $45
 trillion
 company.
 It's
 still


trading
 it's
 not
 trading
 at
 its
 lowest


EVA
 multiple
 but
 it's
 still
 trading
 at
 a


relatively
 low
 EV
 to
 EB
 EI
 multiple


compared
 to
 the
 other
 Mac
 7.
 So
 it's
 not


the
 the
 scary
 stock
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 for


the
 long
 term.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 207


pounder
 trying
 to
 go
 for
 203
 got
 to


20261


right
 here.
 203
 again
 resistance
 on
 203


is
 like
 8,000
 10,000
 shares
 now.
 It's


not
 a
 ton.
 So
 there
 is
 a
 shot.
 Apple


right
 there
 too.
 I
 still
 can't
 believe


we're
 staring
 at
 a
 pound
 200.
 Like
 it's


like
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 seeing
 it
 but
 I'm
 not


believing
 it.
 But
 we're
 staring
 at
 a


pounder
 at
 $200


which
 is
 just
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 But
 there


you
 go.
 AMD
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 2%
 as


well.
 BMR
 put
 out
 a
 new
 presentation
 in


their
 8K
 yesterday.
 They
 said
 they
 want


to
 get
 to
 the
 5%
 alchemy
 of
 ETH
 before


they
 begin
 staking.
 They're
 looking
 for


a
 3
 to
 4%
 yield
 on
 their
 staking.
 Again,


I
 think
 with
 BMR,
 if
 you
 can't
 stomach


the
 volatility
 of
 it,
 you
 should
 get
 out


of
 the
 stock
 because
 it's
 not
 for
 the


faint
 of
 heart.
 It's
 leveraged
 against


crypto.
 Crypto
 is
 already
 volatile.
 But


if
 you
 believe
 in
 the
 broader
 ethesis,


then
 I
 think
 BMR
 plays
 out.
 And
 if
 it


does,
 then
 it
 should
 give
 some
 decent


returns.
 Speaking
 of
 BMR,
 here
 was
 Mr.


Tom
 Lee
 at
 the
 Saudi
 Arabia
 conference


yesterday
 speaking
 about
 the
 value
 of


tokenization.


>> Crypto
 has
 been
 a
 huge
 outperforming


asset
 class.
 If
 we
 look
 at
 the
 last
 10


years,
 a
 hund
 a
 million
 dollars
 invested


in
 the
 S&P
 500
 today
 would
 be
 worth
 $3


million.
 Um,
 a
 million
 dollars
 invested


in
 Bitcoin
 10
 years
 ago
 would
 be
 worth


116
 million.
 A
 million
 dollars
 invested


in
 Ethereum
 10
 years
 ago
 would
 be
 worth


$500
 million
 today.
 So
 uh
 as
 far
 as


asset
 class
 performance,
 uh
 there
 is


nothing
 even
 approaching
 the
 returns


that
 have
 come
 from
 crypto.
 Crypto
 sits


at
 the
 intersection
 today
 of
 two
 super


cycles.
 One
 is
 that
 is
 Wall
 Street


moving
 on
 to
 the
 blockchain
 evidenced
 by


stable
 coins
 and
 eventually
 tokenization


of
 assets.
 But
 it's
 also
 sitting
 I
 think


going
 to
 play
 a
 very
 important
 role
 in


aic
 AI.
 Um
 and
 that
 means
 that
 any


region
 that
 supports
 the
 growth
 of


blockchain
 and
 invests
 in
 it
 is
 going
 to


also
 be
 sitting
 at
 this
 important


intersection.
 You
 know,
 when
 I
 think


about
 the
 Bitcoin
 rationale,
 why


investors
 buy
 Bitcoin,
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 principal
 things
 that
 draws
 them


here
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 Bitcoin
 is
 digital


gold.
 Um
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 store
 of
 value


in
 a
 world
 that's
 increasingly
 digital.


U
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 all
 think


about
 the
 idea
 of
 is
 Bitcoin
 going
 to
 be


attractive
 if
 gold
 itself
 is
 available


on
 the
 blockchain?
 So
 that
 if
 gold


becomes
 digitized
 and
 we
 can
 buy
 it
 as


easily
 as
 we
 can
 buy
 Bitcoin,
 would
 we


still
 want
 to
 own
 Bitcoin?


>> The
 thing
 about
 tokenized
 gold
 is
 that


you
 still
 have
 the
 party,
 the


counterparty
 risk
 and
 you
 might
 show
 up


there
 and
 there
 might
 not
 be
 any
 gold.


The
 thing
 about
 Bitcoin
 is
 that
 the


token
 itself
 once
 you
 have
 it
 in
 your


address,
 that's
 it.
 It's
 final


settlement.


>> You
 got
 very
 important
 financial
 people


talking
 about
 the
 bullcase
 for


tokenization
 and
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean
 again


and
 then
 you
 got
 the
 United
 States


government
 being
 very
 friendly
 with
 the


legislation
 that
 is
 going
 to
 help


support
 those
 assets.
 It
 does
 it
 just


feels
 like
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years


having
 exposure
 to
 those
 asset
 classes


matters
 and
 then
 you
 get
 to
 pick
 which


one
 you
 can
 stomach
 in
 terms
 of the


volatility
 whether
 it's
 Hood,
 Coinbase,


Micro
 Strategy,
 BMR,
 but
 it
 does
 not


look
 like
 that
 train
 is
 slowing
 down


anytime
 soon.
 SoFi
 right
 there
 that's
 up


about
 1%.
 AMD
 still
 up
 1.2.
 Uh
 S&P


getting
 a
 red
 candle
 right
 there
 from


685
 to
 683.


But
 you
 do
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 red
 and


pound
 right
 there
 at
 200.9,


Nvidia
 at
 206,
 S&P
 at
 683.
 Now,
 we
 did


have
 some
 hawkish
 comments
 today
 by
 one


of
 the
 Fed
 presidents,


uh,
 Fed
 President
 Logan,
 if
 you
 can
 see


right
 here
 on
 the
 screen,
 they
 basically


just
 said,
 "Inflation's
 going
 up.
 Labor


market's
 bad.
 We
 shouldn't
 be
 cutting.


We
 have
 to
 look
 at
 repro
 rates."
 I
 mean,


they
 just
 said
 a
 ton
 of
 different
 things


about
 why
 we
 should
 not
 be
 cutting


rates.
 Uh
 this
 was
 the
 only
 person
 on


the
 federal
 board
 that
 was
 more
 bearish.


Uh
 you
 know,
 thankfully
 you've
 got
 a
 lot


of
 other
 Fed
 presidents
 that
 see
 the


downside
 risk
 to
 infl
 to to
 to
 uh
 the


labor
 market
 outweighing
 any
 upside
 risk


to
 inflation.
 But
 nonetheless,
 you
 do


have
 some
 of
 that
 commentary
 right
 there


by
 one
 of
 the
 Fed
 presidents.
 That's


that
 could
 also
 potentially
 be
 creating


a
 little
 bit
 of
 weakness
 across
 the


market
 if
 you
 know
 some
 market


participants
 think
 we're
 not
 going
 to


get
 that
 December
 cut.
 But
 we're
 going


to
 have
 to
 see.
 HMS
 is
 up
 4%.
 A
 is
 up


2.86%.
 BMR
 4664


that
 continues
 to
 go
 green
 as
 well.
 Gold


still
 above
 4,000.
 Nebius
 still
 making
 a


move
 as
 well.
 120.
 Wow,
 Nebius,
 look
 at


that.
 Trying
 to
 go
 for
 130.
 Data
 center


play
 is
 getting
 some
 love
 here.
 Likely


based
 on
 what
 Amazon
 said.
 Cory
 at
 133.


And
 you
 got
 Nebas
 trying
 to
 move
 its
 way


to
 130.


Uh,
 do
 we
 have
 PMI?
 We
 do
 have
 PMI


Chicago
 PMI
 43.8
 versus
 40.6.


43.8
 versus
 40.6.
 The
 estimate
 was
 42.3.


So,
 we
 got
 a
 beat
 on
 PMI.
 We
 got
 a
 beat


on
 PMI.
 Let
 me
 pull
 that
 up
 right
 here.


Happy
 Friday.
 Happy
 Halloween.
 And
 yes,


we
 are
 getting
 some
 of
 the
 PMIs.
 We
 get


confidence
 numbers.
 They
 don't
 go


through
 the
 government.
 Chicago's


October
 read
 on
 PMI
 comes
 in
 better
 than


expected,
 43.8.


We're
 expecting
 a
 number
 closer
 to
 42


and
 a
 half.
 There's
 good
 and
 there's


bad.
 This
 is
 the
 best
 since
 well,
 July


of
 this
 year,
 but
 that's
 still
 an


improvement,
 sequentially
 higher
 than


our
 final
 read
 last
 month
 at
 40.6.


Here's
 the
 fly
 in
 the
 ointment.
 This
 is


the
 23rd
 consecutive
 month
 in


contraction
 territory,
 meaning
 under
 50.


The
 last
 month
 to
 be
 an
 expansion
 over


50
 was
 November
 of
 23.
 Right
 now,
 as
 we


sit
 at
 408
 in
 a
 10-year,
 we're
 basically


down
 two
 basis
 points
 on
 the
 day,
 but


we're
 up
 eight
 basis
 points
 on
 the
 week.


A
 two-year
 is
 up
 11
 basis
 points
 on
 the


week.
 And
 remember,
 both
 these


maturities
 are
 higher
 in
 yield
 than
 they


were
 before
 the
 September
 25
 basis
 point


cut.
 Lesson
 to
 be
 learned
 here,
 we
 could


all
 wish
 the
 Fed
 lowers
 rates.
 that


doesn't
 mean
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 go


along
 with
 it.
 Squawk
 on
 the
 street
 will


return.


>> Okay,
 so
 PMI


uh
 still
 contracting


for
 what
 seems
 like
 about
 a
 year
 right


now,
 but
 it
 is
 beating
 expectations,


which
 is
 good.
 And
 you
 know,
 that's


another
 reason
 why
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 bullish
 on


this
 market
 because
 we've
 had
 such
 a


contraction
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years


in
 PMI
 that
 any
 level
 of
 expansion,
 aka


above
 50,
 would
 be
 very
 important.
 And


you
 know,
 that
 would
 be
 another
 bullcase


for
 earnings
 as
 well.
 Apple
 right
 there


271
 trying
 to
 go
 green
 after
 being
 red.


This
 is
 the
 heat
 map
 for
 the
 day.
 Let
 me


know
 if
 anyone's
 making
 any
 moves.
 I
 saw


a
 couple
 people
 saying
 they
 were


trimming
 their
 Amazon
 options.
 Few


people
 said
 they
 were
 trimming
 shares,


but
 seems
 like
 most
 people
 are
 holding.


It's
 a
 green
 day
 outside
 of
 a
 few


sectors.
 Real
 estate,
 utilities,


healthcare,
 consumer
 defensives,
 and


financials,


which
 is


a
 lot
 of
 the
 market
 besides
 tech.
 I
 mean


it
 looks
 like
 tech,
 communication


services,
 electronics,
 cyclical,


technology,
 semis,
 software


applications,
 etc.
 are
 green.
 Everything


else
 is
 red.


Now,
 Meta
 is
 one
 of
 the
 main
 red
 names


in
 that
 uh
 green
 tech
 trade.
 Amazon


still
 holding
 11%
 but
 everything
 else


still
 red.
 That
 is
 kind
 of
 weird.


Everything
 going
 red
 except


tech
 today.


I
 guess
 it's
 on
 the
 back
 of
 good


earnings.
 Google
 going
 red
 279
 again
 on


Google.
 I
 know
 we
 pumped
 to
 like
 297,


but
 you
 can't
 you
 just
 can't
 be
 that


upset,
 right?
 Google
 was
 at
 250
 a
 week


ago.
 Now
 it's
 at
 280.


But
 that
 one
 does
 go
 red.
 Netflix,
 they


got
 that
 split.
 So
 that's
 why
 Netflix


is
 going
 green.


And
 Meta,
 wow,
 Meta
 656.
 I
 bought
 at


659.


Goodness,
 dude.
 I
 think
 the
 lowest
 it


got
 to
 was
 at
 650
 yesterday.
 So
 we


didn't
 violate
 those
 lows
 yet.


But
 we
 are
 red
 on
 Mr.
 Meta.
 Are
 you


buying
 Netflix?
 I
 I
 want
 to
 see
 what
 the


covered
 call
 premiums
 look
 like.
 I
 mean,


Netflix
 has
 some
 pretty
 decent
 premiums.


So,
 when
 they
 split,
 I
 might
 buy


Netflix.
 But
 I
 also,
 Dude,
 I've
 never


loved
 Netflix.
 I
 mean,
 trades
 at
 like
 45


times
 earnings.
 Like,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


the
 companies
 that
 are
 growing
 faster


you
 could
 buy
 at
 that
 multiple.
 But
 the


reason
 Netflix
 caught
 a
 bid
 this
 year,


it's
 still
 up
 40%.
 Is
 because
 I
 mean,


who's
 canceling
 Netflix
 in
 a
 recession?


Now,
 granted,


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 good


content
 on
 Netflix,
 but
 I'm,
 you
 know,


so
 I
 if
 if
 things
 really
 got
 bad,
 I


would
 cancel
 it
 and
 not
 care.
 But
 I


guess
 there's
 enough
 content
 that
 keeps


people
 engaged.
 And
 every
 quarter,
 they


keep
 finding
 more
 subscribers,


which
 is
 why
 people
 buy
 in.
 Robin
 right


there.
 147.


Robin
 right
 there.


47.


Chipotle.
 Are
 we
 still
 doing
 okay
 on


Chipotle?


Wow.
 Still
 down.
 It
 might
 break
 30.
 It


might,
 you
 could
 tell
 Bill
 Aman
 was


pissed
 off
 yesterday.
 Bill
 Aman
 quoted


some
 random
 account
 on
 Twitter
 that


said,
 "The
 way
 Chipotle
 needs
 to
 fix
 its


business
 is
 to
 cut
 the
 burrito
 in
 half


because
 the
 burrito
 is
 too
 big
 in
 the


first
 place."
 And
 honestly,
 it
 makes


sense.
 No
 one
 like
 it's
 hard
 to
 finish


the
 full
 burrito
 if
 you've
 had
 it.
 like


it
 it's
 like
 and
 then
 it
 gets
 messy
 and


you
 can
 barely
 hold
 it.
 So
 it's
 like
 the


the
 the
 the
 account
 was
 like
 cut
 the


burrito
 in
 half
 and
 make
 it
 under
 $10


and
 you
 would
 have
 tons
 of
 people
 coming


to
 Chipotle.
 But
 a
 big
 burrito
 that
 no


one's
 going
 to
 finish
 that's
 15
 bucks.


It's
 like
 and
 Bill
 Aman
 tagged
 Chipotle.


Bill
 Aman
 owns
 21
 million
 shares
 of


Chipotle.
 He's
 like,
 "Hey
 guys,
 maybe


you
 should
 think
 of
 this
 idea."
 So
 you


can
 tell
 he's
 a
 bit
 pissed
 off
 that


Chipotle
 is
 not
 executed.


A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 saying
 disagree.
 Yeah,


I
 I
 I
 tend
 to
 not
 finish
 the
 full


burrito,
 dude.
 It
 just
 becomes
 too
 much.


So,
 I
 actually
 like
 the
 idea.
 Like,
 if


they
 can
 make
 a
 cheap
 version
 of
 the


burrito
 and
 it's
 just
 not
 as
 big,
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 think
 that
 could
 drive


more
 sales,
 but
 it
 might
 have
 some
 other


people
 saying
 that
 that
 wouldn't
 play


out.


Uh
 AMD
 starting
 to
 get
 a
 pump.
 That
 one


moving
 as
 well.


Make
 it
 bigger
 and
 half
 the
 price.
 Okay,


that's
 not
 sustainable.
 That's
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a
 margin
 if


they
 do
 that.
 Rocket
 Lab
 6141.


That's
 green
 because
 you're
 like
 5'4.


Okay.
 First
 of
 all,
 I'm
 5'7.
 5'8
 on
 a


good
 day.
 All right.
 So,
 you
 got
 to


watch
 your
 mouth.
 All right.
 Second
 of


all,
 it's
 No,
 it's
 just
 cuz
 the


burrito's
 freaking
 huge,
 dude.
 And
 they


never
 wrap
 it
 perfectly.
 So,
 it's
 like


it
 ends
 up
 becoming
 a
 salad
 with
 a


tortilla.


But


that's


that's
 that's
 one
 suggestion
 that
 exists


on
 uh
 Chipotle.
 Meta
 right
 there
 657.


All right,
 let's
 see
 if
 Meta
 violates


650.
 Let's
 see
 if
 it
 gets
 any
 love
 or
 if


it
 violates
 6
 650.
 I
 mean, if
 you
 see


the
 640s,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 becomes
 a
 bit


more
 attractive
 or
 at least
 the
 low


650s.
 But
 let's
 see.
 Right
 now,
 it's


getting
 dumped
 2%.
 Meta
 market
 cap
 1.65


65
 trillion
 down
 from
 about
 1.97


trillion.


Um,


okay.
 Let's
 see
 a
 couple
 other
 headlines


that
 we
 got
 right
 now.
 Again,
 PMI,
 that


is
 a
 beat.
 We're
 going to
 get
 consumer


confidence
 in
 about
 six
 minutes
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 we
 get
 there.


Pounder,
 we
 still
 holding
 200.
 We
 are


still
 holding
 200,
 folks,
 on
 pounder.


What
 are
 we
 thinking
 on
 pounder?
 Are


people
 getting
 nervous,
 scared,
 excited


before
 earnings?
 How
 are
 you
 thinking
 of


it?


How
 are
 we
 navigating
 pounders
 move?
 By


the
 way,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 The
 S&P


500
 is
 set
 for
 its
 sixth
 straight


monthly
 gain.
 If
 we
 end
 out
 green
 today,


which
 even
 if
 we
 don't
 end
 out
 green,


we're
 still
 going
 to
 be
 way
 higher
 than


we,
 Dude,
 October,
 we
 fell
 to
 647.
 Even


if
 we
 closed
 at
 650
 today,
 which
 would


be
 a
 3%
 drop
 from
 these
 levels,
 we
 would


still
 be
 green.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 be


green
 for
 the
 sixth
 month
 in
 a
 row.
 And


big
 tech,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 is


leading
 the
 multiple
 expansion
 for
 the


S&P
 as
 those
 companies


continue
 to
 perform
 on
 earnings.


And
 that's
 what
 you
 got.


Excited,
 excited,
 excited.
 See
 most


people
 getting
 excited,
 ecstatic.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I'm
 really
 confident


on
 the
 earnings.
 I
 just
 think
 they're


going
 to
 have
 a
 massive
 quarter.
 And
 so


now
 I
 I
 was
 expecting
 to
 move
 to
 200
 on


that
 quarter.
 Now
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't
 know


like
 I
 don't
 know
 210
 215
 or
 is
 it
 so


good
 but
 it's
 baked
 in
 like
 I
 I
 have
 no


clue.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


good
 quarter.
 And
 you
 know
 as
 long
 as


the
 company
 keeps
 performing
 the
 stock


price
 eventually
 over
 time
 that'll


that'll
 move
 with
 the
 earnings.
 But
 as


long
 as
 the
 company
 keeps
 performing


that's
 the
 most
 important
 thing.
 S&P


683.
 You
 got
 a
 Reddit
 right
 there.
 15%


224
 Reddit
 big
 day
 and
 then
 Grabby
 Grab


at
 608.
 I
 am
 excited
 about
 Grab
 earnings


as
 well.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 to
 expect.


Again,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


good
 quarter.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 those


stocks
 where
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 up
 25%


this
 year.
 Uh
 I
 do
 think
 it
 has


ambitions
 to
 get
 closer
 to
 $10.
 And
 I've


done
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 on
 this,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 need
 a
 good
 earnings.
 We're


going to
 need
 a
 beat.
 We're
 going
 to


need
 a
 guidance
 raise.
 We're
 gonna
 need


the
 street
 to
 really
 think
 these
 guys


are
 changing
 their
 narrative
 in
 terms
 of


how
 dominant
 they're
 becoming.
 We're


gonna
 find
 out
 7:30.
 I'm
 likely
 not


going
 to
 be
 live
 for
 Grab
 earnings,
 but


uh
 well,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it
 the
 next


day
 after,
 but
 7:30
 p.m.
 Eastern
 on


Monday.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 we
 get
 from


Grab.
 Has
 Grab
 tested
 your
 conviction


more
 than
 pound
 Hood?
 100%.
 100%.
 Now,


and
 it's
 it's
 funny
 I
 say
 that,
 right?


Because
 pounder
 and
 hood
 were
 stuck.


Like
 Grab
 has
 moved
 25%
 this
 year.


Pounder
 and
 Hood
 when
 I
 got
 them
 they


were
 stuck
 for
 a
 year.
 Like
 they
 didn't


they
 didn't
 pounder
 didn't
 get
 any
 25%


move.
 It
 got
 a
 25%
 draw.
 I
 got
 a
 70%


draw
 down.
 But
 pounder
 is
 a
 much
 more


higher
 quality
 company
 than
 Grab


obviously.
 So
 this
 one
 is
 definitely


tested
 conviction.
 But
 I
 continue
 to


look
 at
 the
 I
 was
 talking
 with
 Steve


last
 night.
 I
 looked
 at
 seven
 different


discounted
 cash
 flow
 models.
 All
 of
 them


come
 to
 the
 same
 price
 target.
 Maybe


even
 played
 with
 the
 numbers
 from
 750
 to


830
 as
 intrinsic
 fair
 value.


So
 these
 are
 the
 moments
 where
 you
 just


got
 to,
 you
 know,
 ignore
 all
 the
 noise


and
 say,
 "All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 happens."
 But
 sometimes
 you
 got
 to


trust
 yourself
 as
 well
 and
 see
 how
 it


plays
 out.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there,
 110,


Ethereum
 3852,
 BMR,
 are
 we
 getting
 any


move?
 Apple
 goes
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 Bit


mine
 4670


on
 the
 day.
 The
 googs
 is
 red
 278.


278
 on
 the
 goog.
 Where's
 Weeble?
 This


one
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 excited
 about.


Weeble.
 Dude,
 this
 one's
 been
 stuck
 as


well.
 Back
 to
 11.
 Got
 to
 12.


Right
 back
 to
 11.


Only
 a
 5-year-old
 can't
 finish
 a


Chipotle
 burrito.


I
 guess
 I'm
 alone,
 dude.
 I
 guess
 I'm


alone.
 I
 can't
 finish
 that
 damn
 burrito.


This
 goes
 back
 to
 what
 Steve
 said,
 dude.


I
 I
 can't
 finish
 my
 steak.
 I
 always
 I


always
 save
 it
 for
 later.
 CRDO,
 they


also
 had
 a
 big
 move
 today.
 This
 is
 a


correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong.
 Yeah,
 9%
 move.


This
 is
 a
 important
 company
 in
 the


semiconductor
 ecosystem
 around


cables,
 circuits,
 etc.


I
 feel
 like
 they've
 had
 a
 pretty
 strong


relationship
 with
 Nvidia
 for
 a
 long
 time


as
 well.
 Credo
 Technology
 Group,
 that's


up
 9%
 on
 the
 day.
 I
 believe
 they
 had
 a


double
 beat
 as
 well


and
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 green.


Nebus
 back
 to
 130.


back
 to
 130.


A
 man,
 I
 have a
 question.
 I
 bought
 GSIT


because
 I
 feel
 strong
 about
 their
 GPU


tech.
 Down
 35%
 on
 that,
 but
 with
 their


$50
 million
 investment,
 hoping
 Q4
 takes


off,
 do
 I
 buy
 too
 early?
 So,
 GSIT
 is
 the


company
 that
 put
 out
 that
 white
 paper,


right?
 Yeah,
 we
 looked
 at
 this
 a
 week


ago.
 They
 put
 out
 the
 white
 paper
 about


how
 they
 have
 a
 better
 chip
 than
 Nvidia.


Um,
 you're
 down
 35%.
 So,
 you
 probably


bought
 it
 around
 that
 12-
 $13
 range.


Now,
 it's
 at
 9.
 Yeah.
 See,
 this
 comes


back
 down
 to
 like
 due
 diligence,
 right?


Just
 how
 much
 do
 you
 understand
 about


the
 company?
 Uh,
 did
 you
 buy
 too
 early?


I
 have
 no
 idea.
 May
 maybe
 this
 thing's


going
 to
 15
 after
 their
 earnings
 and
 you


bought
 just
 at
 the
 right
 time.


But
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 them


outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 released
 a


white
 paper.
 The
 stock
 gained
 a
 hundred


million
 dollars
 in
 market
 cap
 because


they
 released
 a
 white
 paper
 saying
 they


can
 make
 chips
 better
 than
 Nvidia
 from


an
 energy
 perspective.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 after
 a
 week,
 people
 probably


realize
 there's
 no
 revenue,
 there's
 no


earnings,
 there's,
 you
 know,
 so
 it's


like,
 but
 some
 of
 these
 names,
 if
 you're


betting
 on
 them
 from
 a
 speculative


standpoint,
 you
 just
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 to


deal
 with
 the
 volatility
 of
 the


speculation.


But
 I
 would
 I
 would
 wait
 till
 learnings,


right?
 You
 got
 to
 wait
 till
 learnings
 to


see
 how
 that
 plays
 out.


So,
 there
 you
 go.


Is
 Bur
 tweet
 saying
 we're
 in
 a
 bubble,


but
 not
 the
 point
 of
 selling?
 No.
 Bur's


tweet
 is
 just
 him
 being
 annoyed
 that
 the


market
 is
 going
 up.
 That's
 why
 it's


poetic,
 right?
 That's
 why
 he
 says


sometimes
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 do
 is
 not
 do


anything
 because
 he
 knows
 shorting
 it


makes
 no
 sense.
 But
 he
 also
 thinks


buying
 into
 it
 is
 too
 aggressive.
 So


he's
 probably
 implying
 that
 you
 should


sell
 and
 take
 your
 gains.


But
 then
 again,
 it
 begs
 the
 question,


you
 know,
 is
 the
 earnings
 growth
 not


there?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 a
 simple
 question


for
 every
 is
 the
 earnings
 growth
 not


there?
 If
 you
 think
 the
 earnings
 growth


is
 not
 there,
 then
 you
 get
 out
 of
 this


market.
 And
 every
 company
 that
 we've


covered
 outside
 of
 a
 handful,
 literally


a
 handful,
 have
 beat
 on
 EPS,
 which
 shows


that
 the
 earnings
 growth
 is
 there.
 By


the
 way,
 EOS,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


like
 this
 one
 energy
 uh
 company.
 They


secured
 a
 228
 uh
 megawatt
 order
 from


Frontier
 Power
 under
 their
 existing
 5


gigawatt
 framework
 and
 they
 achieved


their
 final
 cerebrous
 milestone.


So
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 up
 5%
 on
 the


day.
 Bloom
 Energy,
 another
 company
 that


crushed
 it
 this
 week
 in
 energy.
 EOSE,


another
 one
 today
 that
 looks
 like


they're
 getting


some
 momentum


as
 per
 a
 new
 contract.


There
 you
 go.
 That's
 up
 5.59%.


I
 don't
 think
 any
 stock
 down
 1%
 is


dumping.
 I
 agree.
 Google
 down
 1%
 is
 not


dumb.
 Again,
 guys,
 like
 this
 is
 we're


we're
 at
 we're
 also
 at
 a
 stage
 in
 the


market
 where
 I
 think
 people
 are
 just


impatient.
 Like
 Google
 was
 at
 150
 less


than
 three
 months
 ago
 and
 it's
 down
 from


290,
 but
 that
 is
 not
 a
 reason
 to
 be


upset
 about
 it,
 you
 know,
 and
 look,
 if


Paler
 dumps
 10%
 on
 earnings,
 I'm
 sure


people
 will
 be
 so
 upset,
 but
 it's
 like


you
 just
 can't
 have
 sympathy
 for
 those


people.
 It's
 like
 it's
 like
 the
 stock


has
 done
 incredibly.
 Same
 thing
 with


Robin.
 Like
 these
 stocks
 have
 done
 same


thing
 with
 Nebas.
 These
 stocks
 have
 done


amazing.
 So,
 you
 can't
 genuinely
 be


upset
 if
 they
 don't
 hold
 a
 higher


premium
 if
 the
 market
 just
 doesn't
 want


to
 give
 it
 to
 them
 at
 the
 time.


especially
 given
 they're
 already
 holding


such
 a
 such
 a
 strong
 premium.


But
 you
 do
 have
 some
 momentum
 there


across
 the
 entire
 board.
 Robin
 Hood


14737.


I
 think
 Vlad's
 gearing
 up
 for
 a
 pretty


good
 quarter
 which
 will
 be
 very


exciting.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 the
 GooGs


right
 here
 still
 at
 279.
 Crowd
 Strikes


up
 1%.
 Coinbase
 up
 6%
 and
 then
 Corey
 up


2.4.
 Let
 me
 see
 consumer
 confidence.
 I


think
 we
 got
 that.
 Let's
 see
 what
 we've


got


on
 consumer
 confidence.
 We
 got
 spoiled.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 bull
 market
 has


definitely
 spoiled
 a
 lot of
 people,
 but


it
 is
 rather
 healthy
 because
 you're


seeing
 uh
 stocks
 go
 up
 on
 earnings,


stocks
 go
 down
 if
 they
 have
 bad


earnings,
 which
 is
 the
 most
 important


thing.
 Uh
 okay,
 consumer
 confidence.


What
 do
 we
 have?
 Let's
 see.


Uh
 it's
 10:00
 a.m.


Friday.
 Consumer
 confidence.


No,
 I
 guess
 we
 don't
 have
 it.
 I
 thought


we
 had
 it
 today.
 I
 guess
 we
 don't.
 No,


we
 had
 just
 had
 Chicago
 PMI.


I
 thought
 we
 were
 getting
 confidence.


All right.
 Maybe
 we
 don't
 have
 it.


Thought
 we
 were
 probably
 getting
 it
 next


week.
 Usually
 it's
 on
 Friday.
 Maybe
 that


one
 is
 actually
 from
 the
 government.


Yeah,
 I
 think that's
 from
 the
 BLS
 and


the
 BLS.
 The
 BLS
 is
 part
 of
 the


government.
 So,
 that
 one
 we're
 probably


not
 getting
 today.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little


bit
 more
 coverage
 on
 Amazon,
 then
 we'll


keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Two
 tech
 mega
 caps.
 Mackenzie
 Sagalas
 is


covering
 Amazon
 stocks
 spike
 this


morning.
 Steve
 Kovak
 has
 got
 the
 Apple


story
 for
 us
 as
 well.
 McKenzie,
 we'll


start
 with
 you
 on
 Amazon.


>> Hey,
 David.
 So,
 Amazon
 shares
 are


popping
 12%
 all
 thanks
 to
 its
 cloud


comeback
 story.
 AWS
 grew
 just
 over
 20%,


its
 fastest
 pace
 since
 early
 2022,
 and


beat
 even
 the
 most
 bullish
 Whisper


numbers
 with
 33
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 that


helped
 ease
 concerns
 that
 Amazon
 was


slipping
 in
 the
 C
 cloud
 wars,
 especially


after
 Google
 and
 Microsoft
 posted
 even


stronger
 year-over-year
 percentage


growth.
 Now,
 CEO
 Andy
 Jasse,
 he
 says


that
 demand
 is
 strong
 across
 both
 AI
 and


traditional
 workloads
 and
 that
 Amazon
 is


scaling
 compute
 to
 meet
 it.
 Now,
 he
 told


investors
 he
 expects
 AWS
 to
 sustain
 this


momentum
 for
 a
 while,
 ting
 the
 company


up
 for
 its
 first
 ever
 $200
 billion
 plus


quarter
 in
 Q4.
 backlog
 that's
 now
 at


$200
 billion
 dollars,
 not
 including


October's
 unannounced
 deals,
 which


apparently
 exceeded
 the
 entire
 Q3


volume.
 So,
 this
 wasn't
 just
 a
 rebound,


it
 was
 a
 referendum.
 Amazon
 needed
 to


prove
 that
 its
 massive
 infrastructure


bets
 are
 paying
 off.
 It
 spent
 $
 34


billion
 in
 Q3
 alone
 and
 now
 expects
 to


hit
 125
 billion
 in
 capex
 for
 the
 year,


more
 than
 its
 projected
 operating


income.
 A
 big
 chunk
 of
 that
 is
 going


into
 its
 in-house
 AI
 chips
 and
 new


hypers
 scale
 campuses
 like
 Project


Rainineer,
 an
 11
 billion
 data
 center


that
 it
 just
 built
 to
 power
 models


exclusively
 for
 Anthropic.
 This
 is


Amazon's
 answer
 to
 OpenAI
 Stargate.
 And


the
 chief
 takeaway
 across
 big
 tech,
 the


winners
 aren't
 just
 the
 ones
 spending


the
 most,
 they're
 the
 ones
 showing
 that


it
 is
 working.
 Alphabet
 and
 Amazon
 are


seeing
 that
 halo
 effect.
 Microsoft,
 it's


still
 growing
 fast,
 but
 saw
 its
 stock


dip.
 And
 then
 Meta,
 despite
 a
 revenue


and
 earnings
 beat,
 it
 logged
 its
 worst


drop
 in
 three
 years
 as
 investors


questioned
 whether
 its
 AI
 push
 will
 ever


turn
 into
 profit.


>> Now
 again,
 project
 rainier,
 the
 crazy


thing
 about
 it
 is
 that
 that
 is
 just
 for


Anthropic.
 It's
 in
 a
 corn
 field
 in
 um
 in


in
 Indiana
 and
 it's
 literally
 for
 one


foundation
 model
 company
 that's
 already


booked
 using
 their
 tranium
 chips.


To
 have
 that
 level
 of
 backlog
 is
 just


incredible.
 And
 for
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to


expand
 the
 margins
 on
 that
 backlog
 and


have
 it
 already
 fully
 booked.
 I
 mean,


that
 is
 why
 Amazon
 is
 getting
 the


premium
 that
 it's
 getting
 up
 11%
 on
 the


day.
 Not
 at
 255
 like
 we
 were
 yesterday,


but
 again,
 can't
 be
 too
 upset.
 248
 right


there
 on
 Amazon.
 We
 got
 Paul
 Atkins
 on.


He
 is
 uh
 the
 chair
 of
 the
 SEC.
 Last
 time


he
 was
 on,
 he
 talked
 about
 some
 hanky


panky
 going
 on
 in
 the
 market.
 So,
 let's


see
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say
 today.


>> There's
 some
 form
 of
 an
 AI
 bubble.
 Um,


by
 the
 way,
 I
 sometimes
 say
 there's
 an


AI
 bubble
 of
 some
 sort.
 What
 I
 don't


know
 is
 a
 whether
 you
 think
 there's
 a


bubble.
 U,
 but
 b,
 even
 if
 you
 thought


there
 was
 a
 bubble,
 if
 there's
 something


that
 the
 SEC
 should
 be
 doing
 about
 that.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 markets
 will
 be
 markets


and
 people
 uh
 should
 be
 free
 obviously


to
 invest
 in
 what
 they
 want
 to
 invest


in.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 not
 for
 us
 to
 say


we're
 not
 a
 merit
 regulator
 and
 we're


not
 the
 big
 daddy
 over
 the
 marketplace


and
 over
 investing.
 I
 knew
 we
 I
 knew
 we


would
 get
 something,
 bro.
 We
 would
 get


something.
 Last
 time
 we
 got
 Hanky
 Panky


and
 this
 time
 we
 got
 Big
 Daddy.
 I
 have


not
 watched
 this,
 so
 I
 literally
 I
 I


didn't
 watch
 this
 before.
 I'm
 watching


this
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 but
 I
 had
 a


feeling
 we
 would
 get
 something
 and
 we


got
 Big
 Daddy.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you


go.


>> Um
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 we'll
 look
 for


manipulative
 behavior
 and
 take
 action
 uh


where
 appropriate.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 you
 know,


we
 will,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 we're,
 uh,


obviously
 focused
 on,
 uh,
 making
 sure


that
 the
 rules
 and
 and
 the
 laws
 are


being
 followed,


>> right?
 How
 do
 you
 feel
 about
 some
 of
 the


transactions
 that
 are
 taking
 place?


People
 call
 them
 roundtrip
 deals,


circular
 deals.
 Uh,
 they
 appear
 to
 be


disclosed,
 meaning,
 you
 know,
 we're


talking
 about
 them
 here
 because
 we
 know


about
 them.
 Uh,
 but
 there
 are
 these


transactions
 that
 people
 are
 raising
 red


flags
 about.


Well,
 so
 again,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 talk


about
 any
 specifics,
 but
 of
 course
 uh


again,
 we're
 monitoring
 the
 markets
 and


we'll
 bring
 actions
 where
 um
 necessary


and
 indicated.
 So
 um
 but
 uh
 you
 know,
 at


any
 point
 of
 time
 in
 history,
 there's
 al


always
 been
 uh
 people
 who
 try
 to
 do


things
 in
 the
 marketplace
 and
 so
 we


stand
 ready
 to
 uh
 take
 action
 where


necessary.


>> Let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 different
 question


about
 some
 of
 the
 new
 products
 that
 are


coming
 to
 market.
 um
 and
 a
 letter.


>> All
 right,
 so
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 that.
 But


as
 you
 can
 see,
 he
 doesn't
 care,
 dude.


He
 is
 one
 SEC
 chair
 who
 does
 not
 care.


Gary
 Gendler
 had
 an
 opinion
 on


everything
 and
 he
 never
 had
 this
 kind
 of


LZ
 fair
 attitude
 of
 markets
 will
 be


markets
 and
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 big


daddy
 of
 markets.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 Paul


Atkins
 saying,
 "Dude,
 let
 people
 trade.


If
 they're
 going
 to
 buy
 a
 ton
 of
 Nvidia


to
 get
 it
 to
 five
 trillion,
 let
 them.
 If


they're
 going
 to
 buy
 Open
 Door,
 let


them."
 like
 he
 really
 is
 not
 having
 that


approach
 where
 he
 thinks
 he
 needs
 to


micromanage
 or
 govern
 the
 activity
 of


the
 markets
 which
 I
 think
 is
 net


bullish.
 It
 can
 get
 bearish
 if
 you
 have


nefarious
 activity
 going
 on.
 Um
 and
 you


know
 there's
 always
 some
 type
 of


nefarious
 activity
 but
 if
 it's
 not
 as


aggressive
 then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


you're
 letting
 the
 market
 be
 the
 market.


And
 this
 market
 is
 not
 going
 to
 reward


nonsense.
 You
 don't
 put
 up
 good
 growth


you
 get
 crushed.
 You
 put
 up
 good
 growth


like
 Microsoft
 you
 still
 get
 crushed.


So,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 the
 market
 is
 being


fair
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 sure
 they
 have
 a


gut
 check
 on
 what
 stocks
 they're
 going


to
 give
 a
 premium
 to
 or
 not,


which
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 for
 the


broader
 markets.
 Pounder
 right
 there.


20250.


203
 doesn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 resistance,


folks.
 Doesn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 resistance.


What
 a
 crazy
 week,
 dude.
 GTC,
 Fed
 cuts,


all
 these
 tech
 earnings.
 Pound
 here


busting
 through
 the
 200s.
 20275.


I
 mean,
 it
 has
 just
 been
 incredible
 to


witness
 this.
 It
 really
 has.


It
 really,
 really
 has.


It's
 been
 a
 crazy
 journey.
 Crazy,
 crazy


four-year
 journey.
 Red
 at
 225.
 That's
 up


16%.
 And
 then
 Amazon
 still
 holding
 up


11%.
 Meta
 bounced
 off
 657.
 So,
 it
 didn't


get
 to
 those
 650
 lows
 yet,


but
 Meta
 right
 there
 at
 667


on
 the
 day.
 I
 did
 buy
 some
 Meta
 for
 my


sister
 yesterday
 as
 well.
 So,
 I
 bought


some
 meta
 for
 myself
 and
 she
 doesn't


have
 any
 of
 the
 um
 hypers
 scales
 except


Nvidia.
 So,
 I
 did
 buy
 her
 a
 little
 bit


of
 meta


and
 you
 know,
 if
 it
 really
 does
 go
 lower


and
 she
 can
 develop
 a
 position
 in
 it,
 I


don't
 think
 that
 would
 be
 too
 crazy.
 So


far
 right
 there
 2920


as
 well.


Um,
 okay.
 Yeah,
 we
 I
 see
 the
 headline
 JP


Morgan
 has
 8.1%
 stake
 in
 HIMS.
 Again,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 actually
 JP
 Morgan


or
 the
 market
 making
 part
 of
 their


business.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't
 take
 that
 that


seriously.


But
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 him
 get
 some
 more


institutional
 ownership


as
 that
 one
 goes
 higher.
 Nebus,
 what
 do


you
 got
 here?
 Nebius
 12975.


12975.
 That's
 cuz
 Jamie
 Diamond
 is
 using


him.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.


Does
 your
 sister
 own
 she
 knows
 Meta?
 Of


course
 not.
 Of
 course
 not.
 She
 doesn't


care.
 She
 has
 no
 idea.
 She
 probably


hasn't
 checked
 her
 portfolio.
 Dude,
 what


what
 was
 that?
 Was
 it
 end
 of
 September?


early
 October
 where
 we
 just
 had
 a


massive
 run
 in
 the
 markets,
 like
 crazy


run.
 I
 remember
 I
 came
 home
 and
 I
 was


like,
 like,
 "Have
 you
 looked
 at
 your


portfolio?"
 She's
 like, "Nope."
 And
 I


was
 like, "Well,
 you
 should
 open
 it
 up."


And
 she
 opened
 it
 up
 and
 it
 was
 up
 six


figures.
 And
 she's
 like, "Oh,
 that's


crazy."
 I
 was
 like, "I
 hate
 you
 so
 much,


bro.
 I
 hate
 you
 so
 much."
 Like,
 my
 dad


freaking
 checks
 it
 every
 hour
 and
 he's


working
 like
 a
 real
 job
 and
 my
 sister


doesn't
 even
 check
 it
 on
 a
 weekly
 basis.


How
 are
 women
 even
 legal?


It's
 It's
 not
 all
 women.
 It's
 just
 my


sister,
 bro.
 She
 doesn't
 care.
 Like,
 she


legit
 does
 not
 care.


And
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is,
 bro.


But
 it
 also
 helps
 because
 she
 doesn't


ask
 me
 any
 questions,
 bro.
 She
 doesn't


ever
 like
 question
 my
 moves
 and
 she


hasn't
 had
 a
 reason
 to.
 But
 like,


it's
 not,
 you
 know,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 lost


my
 sister
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 dude.
 when
 I


lost
 money
 in
 the
 biotech.
 You
 think


your
 boy
 was
 going
 down
 alone
 on
 that


ship?
 You
 think
 in
 2020
 when
 I
 thought
 I


found
 the
 company
 that
 had
 the
 cure
 for


every
 cancer,
 you
 thought
 I
 was
 not


going
 to
 tell
 anybody
 about
 it?
 Of


course,
 I
 told
 my
 sister.
 And
 of
 course,


she
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 cool.
 Whatever.
 Buy


me
 some."
 And
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 a


year
 later,
 I
 had
 to
 have
 an
 awkward


conversation
 with
 her
 be
 like,
 "Well,


there's
 this
 thing
 called
 tax
 lost


harvesting."
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 on


the
 bright
 side,
 it's
 actually
 very


productive.


And
 she
 was
 just
 like,
 "So,
 I
 lost
 all


my
 money."
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,
 you
 know,


the
 way
 you
 say
 it
 is
 just
 not
 the
 right


way
 to
 frame
 the
 conversation."
 Like,
 we


need
 to
 think
 of
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a


diametrically
 opposed
 way
 that
 allows
 us


to
 have
 a
 new
 paradigm.
 And
 at
 the
 same


time,
 while
 we
 have
 that
 new
 paradigm,


Palunteer
 203,
 baby
 20306


on
 Palunteer.
 Wow.


Busted
 right
 through
 203.


We
 know
 what's
 better
 than
 203,
 guys.


204
 resistance.


204
 is
 9,000
 shares.
 Dude,
 there's
 no


walls.
 There's
 no
 walls.
 This
 is
 like


pure
 price
 discovery.


I
 like
 that.
 Like
 once
 we
 broke
 through


190,
 we
 were
 in
 price
 discovery,
 but
 now


price
 discovery
 because
 we
 are
 well


above
 the
 previous
 all-time
 high.
 There


you
 go.
 203
 again.
 There's
 no
 walls.


There's
 no
 resistance.
 There's
 just


people
 coming
 in
 saying,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 I'm


going
 to
 buy."


My
 goodness.
 20320.


And
 she's
 not
 stopping
 at
 203.
 Guys,


think
 about
 it
 like
 this.
 Now,
 a
 decline


from
 203
 to
 190
 would
 be
 perceived
 as
 a


dip.
 That's
 the
 beautiful
 part
 about
 a


stock
 going
 higher.
 It's
 like
 if
 it


actually
 does
 take
 a
 10-
 15%
 drop,


that's
 a
 10
 15%
 drop.
 That's
 an
 active


amount
 of
 selling
 pressure
 because
 you


had
 all
 that
 buying
 pressure.
 Especially


if
 it
 can
 you
 imagine
 us
 normalizing


200s
 forever,
 which
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get


ahead
 of
 myself.
 We're
 only
 three
 bucks


above
 200,
 but
 like
 could
 you
 imagine


that?
 I
 mean,


to
 not
 have
 to
 ever
 see
 below
 200
 again.


My
 goodness,
 dude.
 Robin
 trying
 to
 get


to

 and
 then

 Amazon


losing
 a
 bit
 of

 right
 there,


but

 and

That's
 quite
 incredible.
 20311.


But
 um
 but
 yeah,
 so
 so
 so
 on
 on
 that
 on


that,
 you
 know,
 biotech
 stock
 that
 I


thought
 was
 going
 to
 change
 the
 world,
 I


you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 went
 down
 down
 with
 the


ship
 with
 other
 people
 on
 the
 ship
 with


me.
 So
 definitely
 in
 2020
 I
 probably


ruined
 her
 trust
 in
 my
 stock
 picking


capabilities


but
 I
 think
 I
 got
 it
 back
 over
 the
 past


two
 years
 and
 that's
 why
 she
 doesn't


question
 a
 single
 thing
 anymore
 like


really
 but
 also
 I
 don't
 invest
 in
 stupid


biotech
 companies
 that
 I
 think
 are
 going


to
 solve
 every
 disease
 in
 the
 world


right
 so
 it's
 like
 I've
 grown
 as
 well


but
 you
 know
 your
 boy
 had
 to
 your
 boy


had
 to
 go
 down
 with
 the
 ship
 there's
 no


way
 your
 boy
 doesn't
 go
 down
 with
 the


ship
 and
 bring
 bring
 people
 along
 with


them.
 Microsoft

 there

 that's

 and
 then
 the

 are

Okay.
 Uh
 back
 to
 Paul
 Atkins.
 Let's
 see


what
 he
 had
 to
 say
 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get


some
 comments
 on
 everything
 else
 that's


going
 down.


>> I
 believe
 you
 received
 from
 Elizabeth


Warren
 and
 Bernie
 Sanders.
 Uh
 this
 is


expressing
 their
 concerns
 about


President
 Trump's
 EO
 that
 would


effectively
 expand
 access
 to
 private


markets.
 crypto
 and
 other
 things
 in


retirement
 plans.


What
 kind
 of
 concerns
 do
 you
 have
 about


those
 those
 products,
 what
 they
 look


like,
 what
 kind
 of
 transparency
 they


have,
 what
 kind
 of
 auditing
 they
 have


and
 the
 like?
 Well,
 like
 as
 you
 said,
 uh


uh
 President
 Trump
 uh
 issued
 an


executive
 order
 uh
 regarding
 uh
 you


know,
 the
 ability
 for
 uh
 retirement


plans
 and
 other
 sorts
 of
 uh
 um
 uh


long-term
 savings
 plans
 to
 be
 able
 to
 uh


access
 alternative
 investments.
 And
 so


the
 as
 far
 as
 the
 retirement
 investments


go,
 we're
 working
 with
 the
 Department
 of


Labor
 and
 of
 course
 all
 this
 is
 affected


by
 the
 shutdown,
 so
 we
 haven't
 really


been
 able
 to
 make
 much
 progress.
 Um
 but


uh
 basically
 we
 will
 be
 working
 uh
 with


the
 secretary
 and
 uh
 and
 deputy


secretary
 and
 others
 at
 the
 department


of
 labor
 have
 already
 met
 with
 them
 and


we
 will
 be
 plotting
 out
 a
 course
 uh
 to


uh
 to
 study
 and
 then
 uh
 make
 proposals


for
 uh
 these
 sorts
 of
 retirement
 plans


to
 be
 able
 to
 access
 uh
 alternative


investments
 but
 within
 guard
 rails.


We're
 not
 just
 going
 to
 fling
 the
 the


gates
 wide
 open.
 And
 then
 on
 the


individual
 elective
 investment
 side,
 uh


we're
 we
 will
 be
 looking
 at
 the
 credited


investor
 standard.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 which
 is


a
 very
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 hard
 bludgeon
 sort
 of


thing
 as
 far
 as
 trying
 to
 determine


who's
 sophisticated
 and
 not.


>> Right
 now
 the
 uh
 qualification
 is
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 million
 dollar
 net
 worth


excluding
 your
 home
 or
 you
 have
 to
 make


$250,000
 a
 year
 for
 the
 past
 three
 years


in
 income.
 So
 it
 is
 a
 really
 stupid
 way


they
 clarify
 accredited
 investor.


If
 they
 change
 that,
 that
 opens
 up
 the


possibility
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 just


be
 able
 to
 get
 access
 to
 things
 like


Android,
 Stripe,
 Discord,
 etc.


>> Uh,
 you
 know,
 is
 that
 still
 something


that
 we
 should
 um,
 you
 know,
 have
 or


modify
 uh,
 you
 know,
 other
 ways
 to
 do


things
 to
 uh,
 have
 uh,
 some
 sort
 of
 a


guard
 rail
 around
 who's
 able
 to
 access


those
 sorts
 of
 products.


>> Can
 I
 try
 out
 an
 idea
 on
 you?
 So
 I'm


fascinated
 by
 the
 these
 new
 sort
 of


venture
 capital
 and
 private
 equity
 and


and
 other
 kinds
 of
 uh
 instruments
 that


would
 likely
 be
 what
 are
 called


semi-liquid
 instruments
 and
 actually
 I
 I


think
 they
 are
 very
 exciting
 instruments


uh
 to
 a
 large
 degree
 in
 the
 context
 of


retirement
 though
 I
 wonder
 whether
 they


should
 have
 effectively
 a
 target
 date
 on


them
 such
 that
 you
 know
 for
 most
 people


they
 will
 look
 like
 a
 stock
 you
 could


buy
 them
 on
 any
 day
 but
 the
 truth
 is


because
 they're
 semi-liquid
 products
 uh


potentially
 you
 may
 not
 be able
 to
 all


sell
 them
 on
 the
 same
 day
 if
 you
 so


wanted
 to.
 And
 so
 while
 someone
 who's
 20


or
 30
 or
 40
 years
 old
 might
 be
 able
 to


buy
 them
 with
 a
 20
 or
 30
 year
 time


horizon
 without
 a
 problem,
 if
 they
 if


you're
 someone
 who's
 a
 65year-old
 or


70year-old,
 uh
 these
 products
 may
 not
 be


uh
 your
 friend
 in
 in
 a
 crisis
 or
 a
 panic


or
 something
 else.
 And
 so
 I
 wonder


whether
 they
 should
 actually
 be
 dated
 uh


in
 the
 in
 the
 context
 of
 retirement


programs
 against
 your
 age,
 meaning
 that


you
 can't
 not
 that
 you
 effectively
 you


can't
 buy
 them
 um
 or
 you
 shouldn't
 be


owning
 them
 at
 a
 certain
 age.
 Does
 that


make
 any
 sense
 to
 you?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 so
 that's
 building
 on
 uh
 uh


products
 that
 uh
 the
 market
 has


experience
 with.
 So
 target
 date
 funds


obviously
 are
 out
 there
 in
 various
 sorts


of
 retirement
 plans.
 Um
 and
 then
 uh
 we


have
 uh
 interval
 funds,
 those
 sorts
 of


things,
 closedend
 funds
 uh
 that
 have


various
 uh
 restrictions
 on
 uh


redemptions
 and
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 uh


that's
 uh
 that
 sounds
 like
 a
 a
 great
 uh


way
 to
 explore
 something
 that
 uh
 you


know
 it
 almost
 sounds
 like
 the
 the
 date


that
 you
 have
 on
 your
 milk
 carton
 or


something
 like
 that
 best
 buy
 or
 best


until.
 So
 anyway,
 so


>> the
 fact
 that
 he
 just
 compared


retirement
 financial
 accounts
 to
 e


expiration
 dates
 on
 a
 milk
 carton
 shows


you
 how
 much
 this
 SEC
 chair
 does
 not


care.


He
 does
 not
 care


in
 a
 good
 way,
 but
 also
 it
 means
 he's


probably
 been
 watching
 Steve's
 live


streams
 a
 lot
 as
 well.
 Robin
 Hood
 got
 to


148,
 folks.
 Big
 move
 on
 Hood,
 dude.
 Like


I
 mean
 I'm
 just
 noticing
 that
 we're
 up


7%
 today
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 which
 is
 kind
 of


crazy.
 Not
 sure
 why.
 Also
 this
 is
 super


bullish
 because
 crypto
 is
 not
 running.


So
 Robin
 is
 moving
 independent
 of
 crypto


today
 which
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 I
 guess


we're
 waiting
 for
 uh
 we're
 waiting
 for


people
 are
 getting
 excited
 for
 earnings


and
 that's
 why
 we're
 getting
 a
 move.


SMCI
 that's
 up
 3.85%.
 Applovin
 up
 3.3.


Palanteer
 still
 back
 to
 203
 right
 there.


20306
 20310
 uh
 AMD
 2.6
 and
 then
 the
 S&P


500
 still
 683.


AMD
 call
 flow
 295
 call
 for
 AMD
 1128
 1.6


million
 coming
 into
 AMD.
 AMD
 does
 have


earnings
 in
 another
 two
 weeks.


So
 you're
 getting
 some
 call
 right
 there.


AMD
 alltime
 high
 is
 267.
 Right
 now
 it's


at
 261


on
 AMD.
 You
 got
 some
 headlines


geopolitically.
 Uh
 Forbes
 and
 Reuters
 is


reporting
 Trump
 officials
 identify


Venezuela
 strike
 targets
 and
 a
 strike


could
 happen
 at
 any
 moment
 as
 per
 the


report.


So
 you
 have
 more
 of
 the
 Venezuela


headlines.
 Uh
 Birkshire
 Hathaway


tomorrow.
 Oh,
 tomorrow's
 earnings
 for
 Q3


for
 Birkshshire.
 This
 is
 the
 last


earnings
 report
 with
 Buffett
 as
 CEO.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 uh
 they
 usually


do
 it
 on
 Saturday,
 so
 it
 makes
 sense.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 they
 did,
 if


they
 sold
 more
 Apple,
 uh
 if
 they
 held


on.
 Again,
 Apple
 really
 was
 the
 defining


metric
 of
 Buffett's
 final
 run
 as
 an


investor
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years.
 He
 has


6xed
 on
 that
 investment.


And
 so,
 that
 one's
 done
 very
 well.
 I
 did


see
 Bergkshire
 get
 a
 couple
 downgrades


from
 the
 JP
 Morgans
 and
 Goldman's
 of
 the


world.
 And
 they
 were
 just
 like,
 "Hey,
 uh


we
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 new
 CEO
 is
 going
 to


be
 anywhere
 near
 Buffett's
 caliber."
 So,


we
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 the
 best
 thing
 to


get
 into
 until
 we
 have
 confidence
 in
 the


CEO.


And
 so,
 you
 do
 have
 some
 downgrades


there.
 AMD
 is
 next
 Monday.
 Really?
 Next


Monday?


No,
 AMD
 is
 on
 Tuesday.


Oh,
 wow.
 Tuesday.
 AMD
 and
 SMCI
 at
 the


same
 time.
 Okay.
 So,
 next
 week's
 going


to
 be
 crazy.
 What
 are
 we
 looking
 at
 next


week?
 We're
 looking
 at
 Poundier,
 Grab,


Uber,
 Shopify,
 Spotify,
 Ferrari,
 AMD,


SMCI,
 Hoodie,
 Qualcomm,
 Apploving,


Dolingo,
 DraftKing,
 Sound,
 Airbnb,
 Trade


Desk,
 Archer,
 DWave,
 Oscar,
 McDonald's,


Lemonade.


Okay,
 next
 week
 is
 going
 to
 be
 wild.


I
 mean,
 this
 week
 was
 big
 tech,
 but
 next


week
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be
 crazy,
 guys.


Palanteer
 is
 not
 doing
 a
 split.
 I
 don't


know
 where
 people
 got
 these
 rumors
 for


on
 a
 split,
 but
 just
 ask
 yourself


logically,
 why
 would
 they
 split
 the


stock
 at
 $200
 a
 share?


Like,
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 a
 company
 that's


done
 that.
 What
 are
 they
 going to
 split


it
 to?
 A
 10
 for
 one
 split
 and
 get
 it


down
 to
 $20?
 They're
 going
 to
 have
 20


billion
 shares
 outstanding.
 You
 know


what
 company
 has
 20
 billion
 shares


outstanding?
 Nvidia.
 And
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 $4


trillion
 company.
 So,
 I
 really
 I
 would


be
 willing
 to
 bet
 my
 life
 that
 we're
 not


doing
 a
 split
 anytime
 soon.
 And
 it's


kind
 of
 dumb
 if
 they
 did
 a
 split.
 and


they
 don't
 need
 to
 pump
 the
 stock
 to
 do


a
 split
 because
 the
 stock's
 done
 well.


So,
 until
 you
 get
 into
 that
 $500
 range,


you
 know,
 I've
 seen
 some
 companies
 do
 it


at
 300,
 400,
 but
 realistically,
 you
 got


to
 get
 above
 500
 for
 you
 to
 think
 a


split
 is
 even
 feasible.


Yeah,
 Meta
 should
 be
 doing
 a
 split.
 You


know,
 when
 you
 get
 to
 above
 $600,
 $700,


it
 becomes
 harder
 to
 buy
 a
 share
 of


stock.


200
 is
 not
 like
 that
 big
 of
 a
 burden
 for


a
 lot
 of
 people
 even
 though
 it's
 it's


higher
 obviously
 than
 like
 a
 $20
 stock


but
 you
 don't
 also
 it
 would
 be
 the


street
 would
 get
 so
 annoyed
 if
 they


artificially
 split
 their
 stock
 they


would
 if
 they're
 if
 they
 thought
 they


were
 trying
 to
 pump
 the
 stock
 by
 making


it
 more
 accessible
 and
 then
 think
 about


the
 volatility
 on
 that
 they
 have
 2.5


billion
 shares
 outstanding
 they
 would


have
 20
 billion
 shares
 they
 split
 it
 by


10
 like


when
 you
 get
 to
 that
 $500
 range
 it
 makes


a
 lot
 more
 sense
 yeah
 and
 you
 can


already
 buy
 fractional
 shares
 exactly


You
 can
 already
 do
 that.


Yeah.
 Even
 when
 they
 split
 it
 would
 be
 a


small
 one.
 Yeah.
 Maybe
 if
 they're
 like


500
 they
 would
 do
 like
 a
 three
 for
 one


split
 or
 something.
 But
 like
 there


you're
 not
 you're
 not
 you're
 not
 seeing


that
 I
 think
 until
 they
 get
 to
 a
 much


higher
 level.


Um


so
 there
 you
 go.


Okay.
 Let's
 look
 at
 a
 couple
 other


things
 that
 we're
 seeing
 right
 here.


here
 amid.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 Hood
 will
 do


on
 their
 next
 earnings?
 We'll
 actually


do
 a
 Hood
 preview
 on
 Monday
 with
 Tanner


Roy
 and
 I
 pounder
 still
 pushing
 203


right
 there.
 20307.
 Uh
 look,
 I
 think


Hood's
 going
 to
 crush.
 The
 earnings


estimates
 have
 gone
 up
 to
 1.2
 billion.
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 deliver
 a


bad
 earnings.
 Uh
 I
 am
 curious
 on
 how


wide
 of
 a
 margin
 they
 could
 beat
 by


which
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 we're
 going
 to


see
 but
 we'll
 go
 through
 the
 actual


numbers
 on
 the
 I
 think
 Coinbase
 earnings


and
 the
 the
 uh
 retail
 revenue
 on


transaction
 revenues
 was
 actually
 very


strong
 which
 makes
 me
 think
 that
 you


know
 Robin's
 going to
 have a
 pretty
 good


quarter
 and
 so
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 that
 bad.


Microsoft
 though,
 why
 is
 Microsoft


getting
 dumped
 today?
 I
 still
 have
 the


five
 shares
 of
 Microsoft
 I
 bought
 a


couple
 days
 ago.
 516.


And
 honestly,
 the
 reason
 I
 kept
 those


shares
 was
 just
 like
 a
 reminder
 to
 me
 of


like,
 hey,
 maybe
 I
 should
 really
 start


thinking
 of
 this
 company
 and


beginning
 a
 DCA
 going
 into
 2026.
 But
 I


don't
 know
 why
 that's
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day


after
 a
 really
 good
 earnings,


but
 that
 one
 is
 down.


What
 are
 the
 best
 robotic
 stocks?
 Tesla,


Greenfield,
 Figures,
 Not
 Public,
 any


others
 you
 like?
 Honestly,
 it's
 Amazon.


It
 really
 is
 Amazon.
 I
 mean
 to
 tell
 me
 a


company
 that's
 using
 robots
 more
 than


Amazon
 right
 now.
 Like
 I
 think
 it's
 hard


to
 say
 it.
 And
 Tesla
 is
 like
 more
 of
 a


multi-year
 uh
 moonshot
 on
 the
 idea
 of


optimist
 becoming
 real.
 Tesla's
 using


robotics
 today.
 ISRG
 is
 a
 good
 one,


right?
 Intuitive
 surgical.
 Uh
 serve


robotics
 is
 out
 there
 bit
 more


speculative.
 Uh
 rich
 tech
 robotics.
 I


don't
 know
 enough
 about
 them,
 but
 you


know,
 they're
 another
 robot.
 But
 like


outside
 of
 these
 smaller
 robot
 companies


that
 might
 not
 have
 moes
 yet
 or
 tons
 of


free
 cash
 flow
 or
 tons
 of
 earnings,
 feel


like
 it's
 Amazon
 and
 Tesla.
 Obviously,


Nvidia
 has
 exposure
 to
 to
 robotics
 as


well,
 but


I
 feel
 like
 it
 would
 be
 those
 two.
 Don't


know
 why
 Microsoft's
 getting
 hit
 today,


though.
 Not
 sure
 why.
 Baba's
 also


getting
 hit.
 Yeah,
 Symbotic,
 that
 one's


another
 robot
 company.
 BMR
 is
 not
 below


NAV
 right
 now.
 BMR
 is
 still
 at
 1.2
 if


I'm
 not
 wrong.


BMR
 1.27
 on
 BMR.


1.27


on
 that
 one.


Um,
 UPS
 says
 have
 exposure
 to
 robotics.


I
 don't
 know if
 that'll
 be
 the
 best


robotics.
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 be


using
 robotics.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 would
 be
 the
 best


robotics
 investment.
 Just
 got
 access
 to


hood
 banking.
 That's
 the
 other
 thing


that
 we
 haven't
 talked
 about
 a
 lot.
 I


mean,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 growth


catalyst
 this
 year,
 but
 next
 year


banking
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 important


and
 that
 could
 be
 another
 game
 changer


for
 Hood.
 Okay,
 couple
 clips
 from
 the


recent
 Mike
 Wilson
 podcast.
 uh
 he
 has


flipped
 bullish
 over
 the
 past
 year
 and
 a


half
 and
 I
 thought
 there
 were
 some


important
 things
 that
 he
 said
 yesterday.


Here's
 the
 first
 thing
 he
 said
 that
 was


pretty
 interesting
 around
 how
 he
 thinks


about
 why
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 going
 up
 in


comparison
 to
 inflation.


>> Second
 reason
 which
 is
 the
 one
 that


people's
 heads
 explode
 on
 is
 that
 stocks


are
 basically
 an
 inflation
 hedge.
 Okay,


particularly
 high
 quality
 stocks.
 S&P


500
 being
 best
 case
 in
 point,
 NASDAQ


even
 more
 so.
 Gold
 as
 you
 know
 has
 gone


through
 the
 roof.
 Okay,
 Bitcoin
 has
 also


done
 extremely
 well.
 Why
 is
 that


happening?
 Because
 investors
 are
 more


worried
 about
 inflation
 today
 than
 they


have
 been
 in
 most
 of
 our
 careers
 going


back
 to
 the
 70s.
 That's,
 you
 know,
 that


wasn't
 around
 the
 70s
 investing.


>> All right.
 So,
 the
 market
 is
 worried


about
 inflation.
 Stocks
 are
 basically
 a


hedge
 against
 that.
 So,
 if
 you
 have
 an


equity
 risk
 premium
 today
 of
 zero,
 you


say
 that's
 crazy.
 Why
 should
 I
 have
 a


zero
 risk
 premium
 relative
 to
 bonds


which
 is
 risk-free?
 Here's
 why.
 If
 bonds


are
 giving
 you
 a
 good
 base
 rate
 of
 1
 and


a
 half%
 that's
 your
 real
 rate.
 That's


four
 minus
 2
 and
 a
 half
 break
 evens.


Okay,
 that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 base
 rate.


Then
 I
 should
 be
 willing
 to
 take
 a
 0%


equity
 risk
 premium.
 Why?
 Because
 I'm


worried
 about
 inflation,


>> right?


>> So
 stocks
 give
 me
 that
 hedge
 against


inflation
 where
 bonds
 do
 not.


Particularly
 if
 you're
 only
 getting
 one


and
 a
 half%
 real
 and
 I
 think
 inflation


will
 probably
 be
 higher
 than
 two
 and a


half%
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years.


>> Okay.
 The
 argument
 there
 being
 pretty


simple,
 saying,
 "Hey,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 if
 people
 are
 investing
 in
 stocks


as
 a
 way
 to
 hedge
 against
 inflation,


then
 they're
 likely
 going
 to
 continue


investing
 in
 stocks
 as
 a
 way
 to
 deal


with
 navigating
 inflation."
 By
 the
 way,


HKD,
 this
 stock
 is
 up
 200%
 today.
 You


guys
 hear
 the
 police
 sirens?


There's
 been
 so
 many
 police
 over
 the


past
 couple
 days.
 HKD
 202%.
 Uh
 this
 is
 a


holding
 company
 which
 engages
 in
 the


development
 of
 digital
 solutions
 for
 the


spideret
 platform.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what


this
 company
 does


but
 they
 are
 up
 213%.


I
 have
 no
 idea
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 That's


making
 a
 move.
 Has
 this
 been
 around
 for


a
 long
 time?
 Yeah,
 it's
 been
 public


since
 2022.
 Obviously
 has
 gone
 through
 a


lot
 of
 reverse
 splits.
 Some
 headlines


catching
 it
 right
 here.
 But
 HKD


is
 going
 great.
 It's
 pumped
 before.


Yeah,
 it
 seems
 like
 it
 has
 pumped


before.


Pal,
 she's
 going
 for
 it.
 She's
 trying
 to


go
 for
 204.
 What
 did
 I
 say
 resistance


was
 before?


Dude,
 203,
 dude,
 forget
 200.
 The
 fact


that
 it's
 above
 200
 and
 holding
 200,


it's
 just
 incredible.
 204
 resistance
 is


13,000
 shares.


13,000
 shares.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 it
 can
 make
 that


move.
 But
 you
 got
 Pounder
 right
 there


trying
 to
 get
 there.
 Wow.
 SoFi
 below
 29.


Look,
 Sofa
 had
 a
 great
 earnings
 this


week.
 It's
 good
 earnings.
 It
 just
 wasn't


enough
 to
 get
 the
 street
 excited,
 which


is
 crazy
 because
 I
 thought
 it
 was


enough.


I
 re
 dude,
 I
 really
 think
 the
 problem


with
 SoFi
 is
 a
 narrative.
 And
 you
 know,


I
 think
 I've
 talked
 about
 it
 for
 the
 for


the
 past
 year.
 there's
 like
 there's
 not


a
 ton
 of
 exciting
 reasons
 for
 the
 street


to
 get
 on
 board
 with
 SoFi.
 Whereas
 with


Hood,
 there's
 just
 so
 many
 different


verticals
 they
 get
 excited
 about.
 That


doesn't
 mean
 SoFi
 is
 bad.
 That
 doesn't


mean
 not
 is
 bad.
 That
 doesn't
 mean


they're
 not
 executing.


It's
 just
 those
 narratives
 have
 to
 come


into
 place.
 And
 you
 know,
 SoFi
 is
 still


up
 100%
 this
 year.
 So,
 it's
 not
 even


like
 it
 shouldn't
 even
 be
 a
 concern.


It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 people
 are
 greedy


because
 they
 see
 some
 of
 the
 other
 names


and
 how
 they
 perform.


But
 it
 is
 weird
 on
 a
 triple
 beat
 with


Ray
 cuts.
 For
 that
 to
 be
 read
 for
 the


week
 is
 just
 weird
 to
 me.
 Meta,
 by
 the


way,
 658


back
 down
 to
 658.
 That
 one
 losing
 660.


654
 would
 be
 where
 it
 has
 to
 violate.


All right,
 here's
 another
 clip
 of
 Mike


Wilson
 talking
 about
 why
 the
 earnings


picture
 is
 continuing
 to
 make
 it
 a


strong
 market
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 multiple


expansion
 on
 the
 S&P.


>> No,
 I
 like
 your
 answer.


>> No,
 no,
 I'm
 saying
 that
 because
 because


it's
 very
 off
 the
 radar
 of
 what
 most


people
 are
 talking
 about
 and
 I
 would
 say


and
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 on
 this.
 So


I
 think
 stocks
 have
 done
 really
 really


well
 for
 two
 reasons.
 A,
 you
 know,


growth
 in
 certain
 parts
 of
 the
 market


have
 been
 quite
 good.
 We
 know
 those


stocks
 and
 they've
 carried
 the
 ind


indices
 higher.
 The
 average
 stock
 has


not
 done
 particularly
 well.
 So
 that
 kind


of
 speaks
 to
 this
 rolling
 recession


which
 now
 I
 think
 is
 over.
 So
 the
 market


is
 looking
 forward
 to
 next
 year
 and


saying,
 "Hey,
 the
 Fed's
 going
 to
 be


cutting.
 Earnings
 are
 actually
 going
 to


be
 probably
 better
 than
 people
 think
 if


we're
 in
 a
 new
 economic
 recovery."
 And


so
 it's
 pricing
 in
 better
 earnings


growth
 than
 what
 the
 market
 is
 modeling


today,
 which
 is
 13
 14%.
 I
 think
 it
 could


be
 something
 closer
 to
 20,
 which
 is
 one


reason
 why
 multiples
 maybe
 aren't
 as


expensive
 as
 people
 think.
 That's
 that's


one
 reason.
 The
 second
 reason,
 which
 is


the
 one
 that
 people's
 heads
 explode
 on,


is
 that
 stocks
 are
 basically
 an


inflation
 hedge.
 Okay,


>> that
 was
 the
 part
 we
 just
 listened
 to.


So,
 let's
 move
 this
 right
 here.


>> Like
 the
 thesis
 I
 just
 laid
 out
 has
 not


really
 played
 out
 yet
 in
 the


marketplace.
 So,
 that's
 why
 I
 think


there's
 still
 an
 opportunity
 assuming


these
 policies
 do
 play
 through
 into
 next


year
 and
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 some
 other


kind
 of
 accident.
 All
 right,
 let's
 go


back
 to
 that
 20%
 EPS
 growth
 uh
 for
 2026


because
 I
 think
 we
 just
 glossed
 over


that.
 Okay,
 but
 I'm
 saying
 they
 deserve


to
 be
 rich
 if
 you
 think
 they're
 a
 good


inflation
 hedge
 particularly
 relative
 to


gold.
 I
 would
 argue
 the
 stocks
 might
 be


a
 cheaper
 inflation
 hedge
 now
 relative


to
 gold
 rel
 compared
 to
 history.
 Okay,


so
 we
 can
 we
 can
 come
 back
 to
 that
 in
 a


minute.


>> But
 that's
 fair.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 anyways
 on
 the
 20%
 it's


really
 so
 if
 you
 buy
 into
 our
 argument


that
 this
 is
 a
 new
 economic
 cycle
 that


there's
 been
 many
 areas
 of
 the
 S&P
 or


Russell
 3000
 that
 have
 been
 under


earning
 for
 the
 last
 three
 years
 and
 I


can
 prove
 that
 we
 show
 it
 in
 our


research.
 So
 the
 last
 three
 years
 the


median
 stock
 okay
 the
 median
 stock
 in


the
 Russell
 3000
 that's
 large
 and
 small


has
 had
 negative
 earnings
 growth
 okay


for
 three
 years
 straight
 and
 it's
 just


starting
 to
 turn
 up
 now
 in
 the
 second


quarter
 was
 6%
 growth
 year-over-year.


That's
 the
 best
 growth
 we've
 seen
 in


three
 years.
 So
 it's
 just
 starting
 to


inflect.
 So
 what's
 going
 on?
 We're


seeing
 better
 revenue
 growth
 and
 we're


seeing
 operating
 leverage
 because
 these


companies
 have
 gotten
 so
 efficient
 now.


They've
 been
 basically
 hiring
 nobody
 for


three
 years.
 I
 mean
 all
 the
 jobs


creation
 in
 the
 last
 year
 has
 been


government
 basically
 and
 healthcare
 and


things
 that
 are
 subsidized
 by
 the


government.
 Okay?
 So
 these
 companies
 are


really
 really
 lean
 and
 they're
 going
 to


stay
 lean
 because
 maybe
 they're
 using


things
 like
 AI
 or
 other
 efficiencies.


And
 if
 we
 get
 a
 new
 economic
 cycle
 and


we
 get
 inflation
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is


good
 for
 earnings.
 This
 is
 another


different
 view
 that
 I
 have
 others.
 I


think
 if
 we
 get
 if
 we
 don't
 get


inflation
 next
 year,
 there's
 no
 chance


of
 getting
 20%
 earnings
 growth.
 I
 think


we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 inflation
 next
 year


in
 the
 right
 places


>> and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 inflation
 wage


inflation
 at
 the
 low
 end.
 Okay,
 pricing


power
 through
 that
 channel
 now
 as
 they


pass
 through
 the
 tariff
 costs
 and
 that


is
 earnings
 power.
 The
 best
 year
 for


earnings
 growth
 in
 the
 last
 40
 years
 by


the
 way
 outside
 of
 coming
 out
 of
 a


recession
 was
 2021.


Okay,
 because
 of
 the
 inflation.
 It
 was


crazy
 good.
 Crazy
 good
 for
 small
 caps,


crazy
 good
 for
 midcaps.
 I
 mean,
 that's


when
 companies
 really


>> consumers,
 corporates,
 they
 had
 a
 lot
 of


money
 slloshing
 around,
 right?


>> Well,
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 more
 money


in
 there
 through
 the
 waste
 channel.


That's
 the
 whole
 point
 is
 that
 and


they're
 still
 at
 the
 the
 wealthy
 are


going
 to
 be
 fine
 because
 they
 made
 so


much
 money
 in
 asset
 prices.
 So,
 there


there's
 still
 tons
 of
 money
 flying


around
 out
 there.
 That's
 why
 the
 stock


>> So,
 the
 broader
 takeaway
 from
 that


pounder
 trying
 to
 push
 204
 is
 that
 the


wealthy
 have
 money.
 They're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 have
 money.
 wage
 inflation,


which
 was
 the
 real
 point
 of
 that


podcast.
 His
 argument
 was
 that
 inflation


is
 good
 if
 you
 have
 inflation
 in
 the


right
 direction,
 is
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for


people
 that
 are
 uh
 lower
 income
 as
 their


wages
 will
 go
 up.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 if


you
 have
 earnings
 growth,
 healthy


inflation,
 and
 you
 have
 the
 wealthy


continuing
 to
 borrow
 against
 their


assets
 that
 are
 doing
 well
 because
 of


earnings
 growth,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 we're


in
 a
 bare
 market,
 especially
 when
 we
 had


a
 30%
 draw
 down
 back
 in
 April,
 which


created
 the
 new
 bull
 market.
 That's
 what


Tom
 Lee
 and
 Mike
 Wilson
 have
 really
 been


on
 in
 terms
 of
 this
 theory
 that
 the
 bull


market
 started
 when
 we
 had
 a
 recession.


It
 was
 a
 very
 quick
 recession,
 but
 it


was
 indeed
 a
 recession.
 And
 then
 as


we've
 been
 able
 to
 maintain
 the
 earnings


growth,
 the
 momentum,
 that's
 what's


allowed
 the
 market
 to
 continue
 moving


forward.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 to
 ask


yourself
 all
 the
 other
 different
 factors


like
 the
 tariff
 revenue
 that
 could
 be


very
 productive.
 The
 uh
 buy
 the
 dip


mentality
 for
 people
 that
 want
 to
 use


stocks
 as
 a
 hedge
 against
 inflation
 as


you
 talked
 about
 as
 a
 hedge
 against


different
 currency
 debasement.
 the
 idea


that
 stocks
 could
 be
 better
 than
 gold
 if


gold
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 aggressive
 and


stocks
 are
 still
 producing
 revenues
 and


earnings
 that
 people
 can
 see.
 Like


there's
 all
 these
 different
 caveats
 to


how
 you
 could
 consider
 people
 wanting
 to


buy
 a
 pounder
 at
 203
 or
 a
 hood
 at
 148
 or


an
 Nvidia
 at
 205


and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 know
 that
 is
 why


this
 bull
 market
 could
 continue.


Wages
 aren't
 going
 up.
 Why
 would


companies
 increase
 wages?
 Well,
 his


argument
 is
 that
 wages
 will
 naturally
 go


up
 as
 earnings
 go
 up.
 Right?
 If


companies
 have
 more
 earnings,
 they're


able
 to
 pay
 more
 money
 to
 their


employees.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 you
 if


you
 don't
 have
 as
 many
 employees
 due
 to


layoffs,
 you're
 able
 to
 pay
 more
 to
 the


ones
 that
 are
 more
 productive.
 Now,


obviously,
 that
 begs
 the
 question
 of


what
 happens
 to
 the
 labor
 market,
 and


that's
 a
 whole
 different
 question
 that,


you
 know,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


necessarily
 have
 the
 answer
 to
 yet,
 but


it
 does
 mean
 that
 asset
 prices
 should


benefit,
 which
 is
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 care


about
 given
 that
 we
 own
 these
 assets.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Hoodie
 is
 trying
 to
 push


150
 right
 here,
 up
 8%,
 almost
 149.


I
 mean
 that's
 a
 big
 move.
 Crypto
 is
 not


moving.
 So
 that's
 moving
 independent
 of


the
 market.
 Nvidia
 back
 to
 206.
 And
 then


Tesla
 also
 making
 a
 big
 move
 as
 well.


454.


That's
 up
 3%.
 Pounder
 surpass
 Netflix
 on


market
 cap.
 Really?
 Is
 that
 true?


Is
 that
 true?


Um


Netflix
 is
 at
 477.


What's
 Poundier's
 market
 cap?


Poundier
 483.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 We
 just


That's
 crazy.


Palunteer
 is
 now
 bigger
 than
 Netflix,


guys.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 This
 is
 like
 I'm


not
 saying
 it's
 cheap.
 I
 haven't
 said


it's
 cheap
 for
 a
 long
 time,


but
 the
 market
 is
 the
 market
 and
 the


market
 will
 decide
 how
 they
 want
 to


price
 these
 assets.
 We
 are
 three
 cents


away
 from
 204.


Three
 cents
 away.
 Okay,
 let's
 see
 if
 we


can
 break
 through.
 204,
 baby.
 204


for
 Palanteer.


We'll
 ring
 the
 bell
 at
 205
 if
 we
 get


there.


204
 for
 Palanteer.


Well,
 you
 know
 what's
 better
 than
 204?


We
 all
 know
 what's
 better
 than
 204.


Dude,
 it's
 really
 trying
 to
 catch
 up
 to


Nvidia.
 It's
 trying
 to
 twin
 with
 Nvidia.


Uh


resistance
 at
 205.


53,000
 shares.


53,000
 shares.


This
 is
 wild,
 bro.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I


will
 ever
 cover
 a
 stock
 that
 does


something
 like
 this
 again.
 I
 mean,


Hoodie
 is
 the
 closest.
 Uh,
 and
 you
 know,


maybe
 Hoodie
 can
 make
 a
 run
 up
 to
 to


200o
 next
 year
 if
 we
 continue
 a
 bull


market.
 But
 I
 I
 Hoodie
 right
 there,
 149.


There
 you
 go.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 will


ever
 be
 lucky
 enough
 to
 cover
 a
 name


that
 does
 what
 this
 does.
 And
 this
 is


why
 you
 got
 to
 cherish
 the
 moment
 and


you
 got
 to
 really
 celebrate
 the
 journey


because
 it
 it it
 truly
 might
 be
 once
 in


a
 lifetime.
 It
 truly


might
 be
 once
 in
 a
 lifetime.
 I
 mean,
 a


stock
 that
 everyone
 hates
 at
 seven
 and


not
 just
 hates,
 like
 vehemently
 hates.


The
 media
 hates
 it.
 Investors
 hate
 it.


Everyone
 hates
 it.
 Goes
 to
 200
 in
 less


than
 three
 years.


I
 mean,
 I
 you
 don't
 see
 that
 story


often.
 You
 really
 don't.


Really
 don't.
 But
 here
 we
 are.


Here
 we
 are.
 20417.


Yeah,
 Jeremy
 is
 Jeremy
 short
 Hood
 and


Palanteer
 and
 Tesla,
 right?
 He's
 short


all
 three.


So


look,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happens
 in
 26.


Obviously,
 we
 can
 get
 a
 correction
 and


all
 these
 names
 could
 take
 a
 10
 15%
 hit,


maybe
 more
 than
 that.
 Like
 that's
 that's


anything
 can
 happen,
 but
 I
 think
 he


initiated
 those
 shorts
 like
 $30
 to
 $40


ago
 for
 all
 of
 those
 names
 for
 Tesla.


He's
 been
 short
 since
 like
 350
 or


something
 around
 that
 rate.
 So
 shorts


haven't
 really
 worked
 out
 yet.


They
 were
 working
 out
 October
 10th.
 I


mean,
 that's
 when
 the
 shorts
 were.
 So,


but
 if
 he
 didn't
 cash
 out,


then
 it's
 still
 there.
 Oh,
 Jeremy
 sold


his
 paler
 short.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So,
 he
 made


some
 money
 on
 it.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 probably.
 Dude,
 like
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago,
 that's
 when
 it
 was


time
 to
 The
 thing
 about
 these
 inverse


funds
 and
 shorts,
 it's
 like
 when
 you
 get


a
 dip,
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 take
 the


profit.
 You
 can't
 get
 greedy.
 Like
 once


you're
 short
 a
 name,
 especially
 those


inverse
 funds
 that
 move
 so
 quick
 against


the
 name.
 Like
 once
 you
 get
 a
 even
 4%


decline,
 you
 get
 like
 an
 eight
 percent


move
 up,
 that's
 when
 you
 take
 your


profits.
 Like
 especially
 if
 it's
 a
 good


company,
 you
 don't
 get
 that
 greedy.
 Now,


Citron
 has
 not
 tweeted
 in
 three
 months


about
 their
 pound
 short
 and
 they
 shorted


at
 180,


which
 again
 was
 basically
 all-time
 highs


and
 now
 we're
 at
 200o.


to
 Hundo.
 Can
 you
 put
 a
 link
 to
 the


podcast?
 Yeah,
 I'll
 put
 a
 link
 to
 the


It's
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 podcast.


Mike
 Wilson,
 it's
 a
 it's
 worth
 listening


to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 analysis
 that
 he
 laid


out
 about
 this
 bull
 market.


>> Um,


again
 guys,
 look,
 it's
 an
 expensive


name.
 It's
 been
 expensive
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Streets
 paying
 a
 premium
 for


growth.
 Uh,
 is
 this
 retail?
 I
 don't


know.
 Could
 it
 be
 retail
 speculated


before
 earnings?
 Sure.
 Uh,
 could
 it
 also


just
 be
 the
 street
 coming
 in
 and
 saying,


"Hey,
 we
 want
 to
 get
 exposure
 before


earnings."
 They
 saw
 Nvidia's
 numbers
 and


they
 were
 like,
 I
 mean,
 first
 of
 all,


Nvidia
 had
 a
 massive
 palenture


partnership
 today
 or
 this
 week.
 That
 was


big.
 And
 then
 Jensen's
 going
 to
 get
 the


most
 important
 software
 stack
 in
 the


world.
 That's
 important.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 saying
 there's
 a
 $500


billion
 AI
 opportunity,
 you
 would


imagine
 that
 Palunteer
 is
 probably
 going


to
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 software


applications
 because
 none
 of
 this


hardware
 matters.
 It's
 very
 important
 to


remember,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 this


for
 a
 year.
 None
 of
 this
 capex
 buildout


matters
 unless
 there's
 a
 use
 case.
 Like


that's
 the
 part
 people
 tend
 to
 forget


has
 to
 be
 something
 that
 is
 uh


productive
 for
 a
 business.
 And
 so
 all


these
 AI
 models
 that
 you're
 training,
 if


the
 use
 case
 ends
 up
 becoming
 a
 company


like
 Pounder
 that
 is
 able
 to
 develop
 and


build
 those
 use
 cases,
 then


you
 know
 that's
 probably
 why
 they
 get


the
 premium.


Let
 me
 check
 hood
 resistance
 to
 150.
 Let


me
 check.
 Very
 weird
 to
 be
 honest
 that


we're
 getting
 this
 move
 today
 and
 I
 love


hood
 but
 I
 just
 I
 can't
 explain
 why


outside
 of
 but
 earnings
 is
 not
 on


Monday.
 So
 it's
 almost
 like
 someone


knows
 something.


I
 mean
 this
 is
 an
 $11
 move
 on
 hood
 dude.


This
 basically
 getting
 close
 to
 alltime


highs
 and
 crypto's
 flat
 which
 is
 super


bullish
 because
 it
 means
 it's
 not


correlated
 with
 crypto.


But
 I'm
 also
 curious
 why
 150
 has
 67,000


shares.


67,000
 shares.
 Roku
 had
 a
 good
 earnings.


So
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 Roku
 is
 getting
 a


move
 right
 here
 14%


on
 the
 day.


The
 price
 target
 on
 Hood
 was
 already


raised
 last
 week
 or
 on
 Monday
 to
 160.
 So


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 price
 target
 move.


Let
 me
 check
 the
 average


price
 target
 of
 Hood
 right
 now.


Average
 price
 target
 is
 143.


Highest
 is
 170.
 What
 about
 pounder?
 I


think
 pounder
 is
 at
 like
 180,
 not
 158.


Highest
 is
 215.


Lowest
 is
 45
 by
 our
 boy
 Richishy.


Well,


making
 a
 move.
 We
 are
 continuing


to
 make
 a
 move.


Uh,
 US
 energy
 secretary
 states
 that


there
 is
 significant
 potential
 for


mutually
 beneficial
 agreements
 in


strengthening
 energy
 relations
 between


China
 and
 the
 US.


That
 is
 good
 to
 hear.
 That
 is
 important


to
 hear.


Oh
 yeah,
 I
 saw
 Chris's
 post
 this
 morning


about
 Hood.
 I
 mean,
 the
 prediction


markets.
 Now,
 again,
 I
 agree
 with
 that.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 why
 today
 the


prediction
 markets
 are
 being
 potentially


factored
 in
 to
 the
 earnings.
 But
 Chris


basically
 said
 Robin
 Hood
 should
 have
 a


monster
 beat
 given
 the
 call
 she
 sports


volume.
 Robin
 Hood
 being
 a


a
 big
 player
 in
 that.
 Oh,
 Key
 Bank


upgraded
 us
 today
 135
 to
 155.
 Okay,


that's
 good.
 So,
 you
 got
 a
 key
 bank


upgrade
 and
 that
 could
 be
 playing
 a


role.


But
 this
 predictions
 market
 should
 be


pretty
 massive


for
 hoodie


pounder
 just
 under
 204


20360.


Then
 you
 had
 hoodie
 at
 14950.


Um


thoughts
 on
 Shopify?
 I
 like
 it.
 Tanner


likes
 it.
 Shopify
 has
 been
 moving


hardcore.


And


now
 shops
 shop's
 one
 of
 those
 companies


that
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 is
 going to


be
 around
 176.
 Is
 this
 alltime
 highs
 on


shop
 or
 this
 is
 close
 to
 alltime
 highs?


Yeah,
 look
 at
 that.
 Shopify.
 No,
 it's


alltime
 highs.


Last
 time
 it
 got
 here
 was
 November
 21.


Dude,
 look
 at
 look
 at
 that
 chart,
 dude.


Look
 at
 the
 [ __ ]
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with


as
 a
 Shopify
 shareholder
 just
 to
 get
 to


that
 level.


There
 you
 go.
 Shopify


Holding
 on.
 S&P
 is
 still
 684.


Still
 684.
 SMCI
 is
 moving.
 Seagate,
 that


one
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 That's
 down
 6%


now.
 It
 did
 have
 a
 really
 big
 move,


so
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 it's
 a
 bit
 down,


but
 Seagate
 right
 there,
 252
 still
 after


a
 good
 number.
 Robin
 Hood,
 she's
 going


for
 it.
 She's
 going
 for
 it.
 Do
 we
 come


back?
 Do
 we
 finally
 come
 back
 to
 150?
 We


are
 two
 cents
 away.


Let's
 see.
 150
 resistance
 again.
 It's


not
 too
 crazy.


Now
 it's
 70,000
 shares.
 You're
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 more
 stacking
 up
 there.


She's
 trying.


She's
 trying.
 She's
 trying.
 She's


trying.


I
 really
 wonder
 what
 Citron's
 going
 to


say,
 bro.
 At
 some
 point
 they
 have
 to


cover
 the
 short.
 either
 they
 double
 down


or
 they
 cover
 here.


Yeah,
 we
 were
 just
 at
 120
 last
 week.


See,
 again,
 really
 good
 fundamental


companies
 as
 the
 markets
 recover,
 they


usually
 tend
 to
 recover


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 now
 that
 they
 have


earnings
 coming
 up,
 if
 they
 can
 just
 put


up
 good
 earnings
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 all


these
 MAX
 7
 doing
 well,
 that's
 really


good
 for
 Robin
 Hood
 because
 that
 means


people
 are
 trading
 that
 means
 their


assets
 under
 custody
 are
 going
 up
 that


means
 people
 in
 general
 are
 more
 bullish


about
 the
 market.
 So,
 so
 like
 the
 market


doing
 well,
 Hood
 is
 a
 proxy
 on
 that


market.
 And
 so,
 Amazon,
 Apple
 hitting


alltime
 highs,
 like
 that's
 really


important
 for
 Hoodie.


150.
 There
 you
 go.
 We
 got
 it,
 folks.
 We


got
 her.


150
 Dolores


after
 a
 long
 time.


It's
 about
 a
 month.


We
 are
 back.


We
 are
 back.


Not
 bad.


150


150
 on
 hoodie
 app

 AMD

 and
 then
 the
 S&P

 Google

 Nvidia

Is
 Meta
 still
 dumping?
 Wow.
 Meta
 new
 low


of
 day
 653.


They
 might
 as
 well
 take
 it
 to
 600
 at


this
 point.
 Like
 if
 they're
 going
 to


dump
 it,
 they
 might
 as
 well
 just
 dump
 it


and
 give
 it
 to
 us.


Alex
 has
 admit
 I
 got
 into
 Hood
 because


of
 your
 channel
 now.
 The
 biggest


position
 in
 my
 portfolio.


Yeah,
 dude.
 Hood's
 been
 Hood's
 been
 a


it's
 been
 a
 special
 one.
 It's
 been
 a


real
 special
 one.


It's
 just
 crazy.
 I
 mean,
 I
 really
 when
 I


when
 I
 was
 buying
 it
 back,
 I
 didn't
 know


it
 would
 be
 making
 a
 pounder
 type
 of


move.
 I
 didn't
 know
 how
 motivated
 Vlad


was
 to
 really
 turn
 the
 ship
 around.
 I


just
 thought,
 hey,
 if
 it
 gets
 to
 25


bucks,
 like,
 you
 know,
 I'll
 make
 some


good
 money.


But
 then
 it
 just
 it
 turned
 into
 like


part
 of
 my
 brand
 like,
 and
 the
 company


wanted
 to
 do
 an
 interview
 and
 a
 podcast


and
 then
 it
 just,
 you
 know,
 got
 invited


to
 the
 events
 and
 like
 it
 really
 was
 a


retail
 story
 for
 a
 company
 that's
 for


retail
 investors.
 And
 um
 the
 thing
 is


they
 didn't
 need
 me
 as
 a
 ret
 like
 I


think
 Palunteer
 needed
 me
 more
 to


communicate
 the
 message
 because
 there


was
 just
 so
 much
 misinformation.
 Robin


Hood
 when
 I
 was
 covering
 it
 had
 70%


institutional
 holding.
 Palenter
 had
 like


30%.
 So
 the
 institutions
 already
 were
 on


board
 with
 Hood.
 It's
 just
 you
 know
 we


were
 in
 a
 bare
 market
 and
 so
 you
 weren't


seeing
 that
 much
 price
 action.


But
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 a
 retail
 story


and
 a
 retail
 investor
 got
 to
 tell
 the


story
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 retail
 investors


I
 think
 is
 the
 coolest
 part
 about
 it.


That's
 why
 it's
 dope.
 Marll
 making
 a


move.
 Marll
 again
 that's
 likely
 because


of
 Amazon


and
 this
 one


getting
 some
 love.
 Alab
 Marll
 wow
 9%


dude
 Marll
 fell
 to
 60
 on
 their
 earnings.


Jose
 likes
 Marlla


this
 was
 down
 last
 week
 17%.
 Do
 they


have
 earnings?
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 had


earnings
 today.
 Did
 they
 sign
 some
 deal?


They
 had
 to
 have
 signed
 some
 deal
 today.


I
 don't
 see
 a
 single
 headline
 on
 ALAB.


Maybe
 uh
 Krato
 earnings
 kind
 of
 pumping


it
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 They
 do
 have


earnings
 next
 week.
 It
 seems
 like
 I
 feel


like
 Krato
 CRDO
 is
 helping
 it.
 Wow.
 17%


move


on
 Astera.


My
 goodness,
 dude.
 My
 goodness.


Chris
 YM
 says,
 "Aid,
 I
 held
 and


continued
 to
 buy
 in
 because
 part
 of
 you


you
 helped
 me
 understand
 the
 tech
 and


the
 ontology.
 I
 sensed
 it,
 but
 I
 wasn't


clear."
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 and
 you
 know,
 it


really
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 it
 was
 me.
 I


think
 it
 was
 me
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 people


to
 help
 me
 understand
 it
 as
 well.
 You


know,
 codestrap
 suchin
 all
 these
 people


my
 channel
 just
 became
 a
 curation


mechanism
 to
 understand
 Palanteer


because
 you
 know
 at
 22
 years
 old
 I


definitely
 didn't
 understand
 the
 entire


thesis.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the
 coolest


part
 about
 the
 journey
 is
 just
 getting


all
 these
 people
 but
 but
 when
 you
 do


that
 that
 forms
 a
 community


intrinsically


and
 that's
 what
 makes
 it
 so
 much
 fun
 and


you
 know
 is
 if
 you
 can
 reach
 an
 audience


with
 that
 and
 and
 they
 become
 part
 of


the
 community
 that's
 why
 you
 know
 the


journey
 becomes
 so
 special.


Very
 very
 cool
 stuff
 folks.
 Very
 cool


stuff.
 Uh
 Dennis
 thanks
 for
 the
 super


chat
 bro.
 All
 of
 this
 is
 out
 of
 touch


with
 reality
 right
 surely
 you
 can
 see


the
 countries
 and
 samples
 but
 stocks


hitting
 alltime
 high.
 not
 a
 bear,
 but


come
 on
 now.
 Look,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 fair


point.
 We've
 talked
 about
 it
 a
 variety


of
 times
 on
 the
 channel.
 We
 have
 a


bifurcated
 economy.
 It
 is
 a
 weird


economy,
 but
 nonetheless,
 it
 is
 the


reality
 of
 the
 world
 that
 we
 live
 in.


There
 are
 people
 that
 are
 not
 holding


assets
 and
 their
 wages
 have
 not
 gone
 up


and
 the
 economy
 is
 not
 working
 for
 them.


This
 is
 why
 you're
 seeing
 the
 the


necessity
 of
 a
 mumani
 in
 New
 York
 City.


Then
 you
 have
 people
 that
 over
 the
 past


five
 years,
 quite
 frankly,
 thanks
 to
 co


that
 made
 investing
 part
 of
 the


zeitgeist
 of
 culture.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 at
 GameStop,
 memecoins,
 all
 this


stuff
 that
 got
 people
 thinking
 about
 the


in
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here


that
 because
 of
 GameStop
 and
 AMC
 just


even
 downloaded
 a
 Robin
 Hood
 account
 in


the
 first
 place.
 You
 have
 that
 faction


of
 the
 economy,
 which
 is
 the
 retail
 part


that
 decided
 to
 join
 the
 institutional


investors
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 are
 going
 to


allocate
 parts
 of
 our
 paycheck,
 parts
 of


our
 stimulus
 checks
 into
 the
 stock


market."
 And
 outside
 of
 2022
 with
 the


Fed
 raising
 rates,
 you
 had
 easy
 money


that
 made
 it
 accessible
 for
 people
 to


understand
 what
 it
 means
 to
 invest.
 Then


you
 had
 a
 crash.
 But
 then
 right
 after


that
 crash,
 nine
 months
 after
 that


crash,
 you
 had
 the
 greatest
 AI


revolution
 or
 the
 greatest
 technology


revolution
 in
 our
 lifetime,
 which
 has


led
 to
 asset
 prices
 even
 with
 a
 uh


restrictive
 policy
 that
 has
 just
 started


to
 ease
 over
 the
 past
 year
 in
 terms
 of


interest
 rates
 allow
 assets
 to
 be
 the


way
 they
 are
 today.


So
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 hard
 of
 a


story
 to
 understand,
 but
 it
 is
 nuanced.


It's
 like,
 yes,
 the
 economy
 in
 certain


places
 is
 definitely
 in
 shambles
 when


you
 look
 at
 delinquency
 rates,
 when
 you


look
 at
 people
 living
 to
 paycheck
 to


paycheck,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 people
 that


don't
 have
 assets,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 wage


inflation,
 but
 then
 other
 parts
 of
 the


economy
 because
 of
 the
 technology


revolution
 and
 because
 of
 monetary


monetary
 easing
 that
 is
 now
 just
 begun


over
 the
 past
 year.
 Um,
 you've
 got


resiliency
 in
 people
 that
 want
 to


protect
 their
 money.
 Not
 to
 mention
 the


elephant
 in
 the
 room,
 where
 else
 do
 you


put
 your
 money
 if
 there
 is
 rampant


inflation?
 And
 I
 think
 because
 we


haven't
 had
 the
 type
 of
 inflation
 uh
 in


the
 past
 40
 years
 that
 we
 had
 back
 in


the
 80s,
 people
 had
 to
 ask
 themselves,


where
 do
 I
 allocate
 capital?
 And
 Bitcoin


came
 up,
 gold
 came
 up,
 the
 S&P
 500
 came


up,
 which
 is
 why
 these
 prices
 are
 able


to
 sustain
 themselves
 even
 if
 they're


not
 owned
 by
 the
 majority
 of
 Americans.


Tesla
 getting
 a
 move
 right
 here
 as
 well.


Look
 at
 that.
 Tesla
 3.6%.


So
 that's
 why
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 that's


why
 I
 think
 the
 markets
 are
 are
 holding


on.
 Coinbase.
 Wow.
 Nine.
 Okay.
 So,


Coinbase
 and
 Hood
 moving
 together


basically.
 Even
 though
 crypto
 is
 flat,


it's
 almost
 like
 the
 Coinbase
 earnings


were
 good
 enough
 for
 the
 market
 to
 uh
 to


give
 the
 brokerages


a
 big
 a
 big
 return
 together.


Oh,
 that's
 incredible.
 Uh
 here's
 our


here's
 our
 guy
 Devin
 Ryan.
 He's
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 hood
 analysts.
 It
 seems
 like


he's
 also
 bullish
 on
 Coin.
 Let's
 get
 his


thoughts
 on
 what
 you
 got
 for
 Coinbase.


So,
 I
 would
 say
 good
 quarter,
 but
 I


think
 the
 update
 from
 last
 night
 was


actually
 more
 important
 just
 around
 the


trajectory
 of
 the
 business
 and
 all
 the


enthusiasm.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about


that
 because
 our
 executive
 editor,
 Brian


Sazy,
 spoke
 with
 the
 CFO,
 Alysia
 Hos,


about
 the
 company's
 play
 for


institutional
 investors
 in
 particular.


Um,
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 play
 what
 she
 had


to
 say
 and
 then
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it.


>> We
 rolled
 out
 this
 new
 white
 glove


service
 offering
 that
 seen
 a
 lot
 of


traction
 and
 we're
 able
 to
 retain
 and


grow
 these
 advanced
 traders
 on
 our


platform.


However,
 another
 bright
 star
 was
 we


closed
 the
 Darabid
 acquisition.
 So,
 our


institutional
 trading
 revenues,
 they


grew
 over
 120%
 in
 the
 quarter.
 120%


growth.
 Phenomenal
 growth.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 that's
 in
 part
 because


they
 went
 from
 very
 little
 to
 then


buying
 this
 thing
 that
 caters
 in
 part
 to


those
 institutional
 customers.
 But,
 um,


how
 like
 I
 think
 of
 Coinbase
 as
 mostly
 a


consumerf
 facing
 or
 retail
 facing


organization,
 but
 I
 guess
 increasingly


that's
 not
 the
 case.


>> Yeah.
 So
 on
 the
 trading
 side,
 um
 the


majority
 of
 volumes
 actually
 come
 from


derivatives,
 so
 options
 and
 futures
 and


that's
 been
 an
 area
 that
 Coinbase
 has


really
 accelerated
 growth
 over
 the
 last


year
 and
 then
 this
 derbit
 exchange
 kind


of
 step
 function
 that
 as
 well.
 So
 uh


they're
 they're
 absolutely
 leaning
 in


there
 and
 then
 building
 really
 the


infrastructure
 around
 that.
 So
 that's


you
 know
 lending
 and
 custody
 and
 other


things
 that
 institutions
 are
 going
 to


demand
 and
 so
 I
 think
 they're
 really


well
 set
 up
 to
 participate
 in
 that.
 But


then
 you
 more
 broadly
 you
 this
 theme
 of


bringing
 other
 companies
 on
 chain


whether
 it's
 through
 stable
 coins
 or
 I


think
 the
 big
 story
 or
 the
 biggest
 story


with
 Coinbase
 is
 the
 everything
 exchange


where
 really
 using
 the
 plumbing
 of


digital
 assets
 to
 bring
 other
 asset


classes
 on
 chain.
 So
 it's
 everything


crypto
 but
 then
 every
 other
 asset
 is


going
 to
 get
 tokenized
 over
 the
 long


term
 and
 Coinbase
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the


middle
 of
 all
 that.
 So
 traditional


financial
 services
 is
 coming
 towards


crypto
 and
 I
 think
 Coinbase
 is
 really


well
 positioned
 for
 that
 theme.
 It's


funny
 because
 Devin
 Ryan
 is
 bullish
 on


Hood
 because
 they
 are
 a
 traditional


financial
 company
 in
 regards
 to
 stocks


that
 is
 embracing
 crypto
 and
 Coinbase
 is


a
 crypto
 company
 that's
 embracing


traditional
 financial
 services
 like


stocks,
 equities,
 futures,
 etc.
 And
 the


convergence
 between
 the
 two
 is
 very


real.
 So,
 it
 makes
 sense
 why
 he
 is


bullish
 on
 Coinbase.
 Look
 at
 that.
 358.


Coinbase
 was
 at
 440
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.


So,
 it
 is
 still
 down
 a
 lot
 from
 that


previous
 high,
 but
 getting
 a
 pretty
 big


move
 right
 here.
 Coinbase
 is
 also
 just


an
 exceptional
 company.
 I
 think
 uh


Tanner
 did
 an
 interview
 with
 Vlad
 uh
 a


few
 months
 ago
 and
 he
 said
 the
 only


company
 that
 he's
 even
 like
 remotely


worried
 about
 in
 terms
 of
 technology
 is


Coinbase.
 Like
 Vlad's
 not
 worried
 about


Schwab
 or
 Fidelity,
 but
 Coinbase


actually
 they
 hire
 engineers,
 they
 pay


them
 really
 well
 and
 you
 know
 they
 build


really
 good
 products.
 So,
 I
 think
 Coin


and
 Hood
 are
 ones
 to
 own
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Obviously,
 I
 I
 like
 Hood
 more,
 but


it
 seems
 like
 they're
 both
 getting
 a
 bit


of
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 Coinbase
 up
 9%.


Tesla
 up
 3.6.
 Palin
 still
 holding
 the


200s,
 got
 to
 204,
 now
 at
 202.
 And
 then


Google
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day


at
 279.


Um
 going
 back
 to
 the
 super
 chat
 as
 well


though
 about
 what
 what
 Dennis
 is
 saying


about
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 reality
 of


the
 economy
 is
 not
 the
 best
 but
 stocks


are
 hitting
 alltime
 high.
 The
 best
 way


to
 hedge
 against
 that
 as
 well
 is
 to
 take


some
 profits
 like
 it's
 not
 that
 crazy
 to


take
 some
 profits
 and
 I
 you
 know
 I


haven't
 fully
 come
 to
 the
 conclusion
 of


what
 I
 want
 to
 do
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


because
 I
 would
 like
 to
 raise
 some
 cash.


I
 think
 that's
 a
 healthy
 thing
 to
 do


regardless
 of
 the
 market
 cycle.
 also


because,
 you
 know,
 you're
 likely
 going


to
 get
 some
 dips
 and
 you
 want
 to
 have


some
 cash
 to
 buy
 those
 dips.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 towards
 the
 end
 of the


year,
 I'm
 definitely
 going
 to
 have
 to


tax
 loss
 harvest
 some
 stuff.
 I
 think


Misti
 is
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 a
 tax


loss
 harvest
 because
 that
 thing
 just


hasn't
 moved.
 Uh,
 now
 Bitcoin
 might
 be


able
 to
 save
 it,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 see.


But
 also,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 myself
 like,


hey,
 like,
 do
 I
 take
 some
 profits
 across


these
 names?
 And
 Palenter
 is
 the
 one


company
 I
 really
 don't
 want
 to
 touch.


So,
 then
 the
 other
 two
 candidates
 that


are
 left
 are
 Nvidia
 and
 Hood.
 And
 I've


got
 to
 ask
 myself,


do
 I
 take
 some
 off
 the
 table


and
 do
 I
 wait
 in
 2026
 if
 we
 get
 a
 better


opportunity?
 So,
 and
 I
 think
 that's


normal.
 That's
 healthy,
 right?
 If
 you're


super
 overweight
 a
 position,
 I
 can't


sell
 Rocket
 Lab.
 You
 guys
 would
 kill
 me.


I
 was
 thinking
 about
 it,
 but
 I
 can't
 do


that.
 But
 also,
 I'm
 not
 super
 overweight


Rocket
 Lab.
 I'm
 really
 overweight.
 Hood


pounder
 and
 Nvidia,


but
 like
 I
 really
 don't
 lose
 sleep


holding
 pounder
 even
 at
 these
 levels.
 I


I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 want
 I
 could
 argue
 I
 lose
 a


little
 bit
 of
 sleep


with
 Hood
 at
 these
 levels
 and
 the
 reason


for
 that
 is
 because
 if
 we
 do
 get
 a


bearish
 downturn
 or
 crypto
 downturn
 like


it's
 just
 inevitable
 Hood
 is
 going to


get
 hit
 and
 like
 that's
 just
 like
 that's


just
 going
 to
 happen.
 Now
 granted
 those


are
 dips
 to
 buy.
 100%
 those
 are
 dips
 to


buy.
 But
 I
 think
 you
 can
 I
 don't
 want
 to


say
 time
 it
 but
 you
 can
 have
 a
 better


understanding
 of
 okay
 if
 things
 are


going
 red
 you
 know
 hood's
 going to
 as
 be


as
 be
 a
 proxy
 beta
 to
 going
 red
 with
 it


and
 you
 can
 buy
 that
 dip
 pretty
 easily


because
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 the
 long-term


vision
 but
 it
 also
 means
 you
 could


probably
 sell
 a
 higher
 level
 and
 not
 be


that
 worried.
 Whereas
 Nvidia
 and
 pounder


it's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 do
 that
 because


they're
 not
 as
 cyclical
 as
 hood.
 Hood
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day
 still
 if
 the
 if
 the


S&P
 falls
 10%
 tomorrow,
 Hood
 is
 going
 to


get
 whacked
 way
 worse
 than
 a
 lot
 of


other
 companies
 because
 their
 trading


volumes
 are
 going
 to
 go
 down
 and
 they


have
 some
 other
 ways
 to
 combat
 that,
 but


not
 enough
 to
 to
 to
 replace
 their
 main


source
 of
 revenue.


So,
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things
 to
 to


think
 about.
 But
 but
 again,
 it's
 a


personal
 decision
 for
 everybody.
 And
 if


you
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 shares
 of
 SoFi
 and
 you


want
 to
 take
 some
 profits
 here,
 take


some
 profit
 like
 like
 that.
 It
 always


makes
 you
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 at


night.
 You'll
 have
 some
 regrets
 in
 the


long
 term.
 That's
 just
 inevitable


because
 stocks
 and
 good
 companies
 tend


to
 go
 up.
 But
 if
 you
 want
 to
 raise
 some


cash
 just
 for
 having
 some
 cash,
 that
 is


not
 a
 bad
 idea.
 We
 are
 in
 a
 bull
 market.


It
 is
 okay
 to
 have
 some
 cash
 on
 the


sidelines
 and
 not
 be
 150%
 in


as
 you
 can
 add
 on
 different


opportunities.
 Hoodie
 moving
 higher


150.20
 20


150


20


pounds
 here
 made
 me
 overweight.


There
 you
 go.


Hood
 is
 not
 a
 hold
 in
 2026.
 I
 mean
 look,


it
 really
 depends
 really
 depends
 on
 if


we
 have
 a
 bull
 market
 or
 bare
 market.


And
 I
 want
 to
 say
 given
 all
 the


hyperscala
 earnings,
 we
 are
 going
 to


continue
 this
 bull
 market.
 But
 it's
 not


like
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a
 straight
 line


up.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going to
 be
 I


mean
 2025
 is
 pretty
 choppy.
 Not
 to


mention,
 you've
 got
 the
 risk
 of
 Trump


saying
 anything
 at
 any
 moment
 of
 the
 day


that
 immediately
 causes
 a
 downturn,


but


I
 think
 it's
 okay
 to
 take
 some
 profits


on
 your
 winners
 and
 then
 just
 hold
 them


for,
 you
 know,
 different
 opportunities.


Amazon
 losing
 250,
 246,
 still
 up
 10%.
 So


it's
 not
 like
 the
 street's
 taken
 away


the
 10%.
 Google
 back
 to
 280


and
 then
 the
 S&P


up
 half
 a
 percent.


Everyone
 was
 saying
 these
 same
 things


last
 year.
 Look,
 that's
 fair.
 That's


also
 fair.
 This
 is
 why
 profit
 taking
 is


very
 subjective,
 you
 know?
 I
 mean,
 dude,


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 the
 tax
 bill
 is
 next


year,
 but
 that
 in
 of
 itself
 is
 going
 to


have
 to
 cause
 me
 to
 take
 some
 profits.
 I


mean,
 I
 had
 I
 had
 to
 sell
 a thousand


shares
 of
 Hood
 this
 year
 for
 freaking


taxes,
 and
 that
 was
 at
 40
 bucks,
 which


was
 not
 fun.
 not
 what
 you
 see
 the
 price


today,
 but


it's
 always
 a
 broader
 subjective
 thing.


But
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 worried
 so
 much


about
 euphoria,
 then


the
 fact
 that
 you
 invested
 in
 the
 market


and
 you
 took
 some
 profits
 from
 your


investments,
 that's
 also


not


the
 uh
 the
 thing
 to
 be
 the
 most
 scared


about.


Okay,
 what
 else
 do
 we
 have?
 What
 else
 do


we
 have?
 Um,
 some
 of
 this
 Fed
 coverage,


we
 talked
 about
 some
 of
 those
 comments.


Let's
 pull
 up
 those
 and
 see
 what
 they're


saying
 about
 this
 future
 rate
 cut


>> becomes
 ingrained
 in
 people's
 psyche.


Policy
 he
 says
 should
 lean
 against


demand
 with
 inflation
 running
 too
 high


and
 above
 target.
 The
 labor
 market
 he


sees
 is
 imbalance.
 Believes
 the
 economy


showing
 some
 momentum.
 Inflation


meanwhile
 he
 says
 is
 spreading
 across


categories
 to
 both
 goods
 and
 services.


He
 went
 on
 to
 note
 that
 the
 financial


market
 conditions
 appear
 to
 be
 easy


including
 equities
 being
 at
 re
 at
 record


highs
 and
 bond
 spreads
 very
 narrow.
 He


thinks
 the
 economy
 accelerated
 through


the
 summer.
 And
 Dallas's
 Lorie
 Logan
 had


a
 similar
 take,
 saying,
 quote,
 "The


economic
 outlook
 didn't
 call
 for
 cutting


rates."
 She
 thinks
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard


for
 her
 to
 support
 a
 cut
 again
 in


December
 unless
 inflation
 is
 falling


faster
 or
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 cooling


more
 than
 had
 been
 forecast.


>> Inflation's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 falling


faster.
 The
 labor
 market
 will
 be.
 So,
 I


think
 even
 if
 some
 of
 these
 Fed


presidents
 think
 that
 we
 can't
 justify
 a


cut,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 cut.
 Even


though
 JPL
 tried
 to
 kind
 of
 tow
 the
 line


of
 a
 cut,
 there's
 no
 way,
 dude,
 given


the
 layoff
 announcements
 we're
 seeing,


we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 cut.
 Also,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 Fed
 presidents,
 they're
 not


realizing
 that
 the
 labor
 market


weakening,
 guess
 what?
 That's


deflationary
 because
 if
 people
 don't


have
 a
 job,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be


buying
 as
 much
 intrinsically.
 The
 labor


market
 weakening
 will
 be
 a
 hedge
 against


inflation
 running
 to
 the
 moon,
 which
 is


like
 the
 thing
 they've
 been
 so
 concerned


about.
 And
 then
 you've
 got
 the
 macro


thesis
 of
 AI
 creating
 so
 much
 of


deflation.


So
 we
 might
 have
 a
 deflationary
 concern


in
 the
 next
 five
 years
 over
 inflation
 if


the
 labor
 market
 continues
 to
 weaken.


And
 that
 might
 be
 another
 reason
 why
 we


have
 to
 lower
 rates.
 And
 so
 at
 this


point
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 a
 Fed
 president


saying
 that
 we
 have
 to
 keep
 rates


stable.
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 you're


looking
 at
 the
 core
 levels
 of
 data
 which


is
 why
 thankfully
 the
 majority
 of
 the


Fed
 presidents


are
 on
 the
 side
 of
 rate
 cuts.


Chad
 in
 this
 chat
 says
 man
 the
 beard
 is


nice
 and
 clean
 today.
 Thank
 you
 Chad.
 I


appreciate
 it.
 I
 appreciate
 the


compliment
 on
 the
 beard
 at
 the
 same
 time


while
 Pounder
 is
 hitting
 an
 all-time


high
 which
 is
 also
 super
 nice
 to
 see.


Chad
 was
 on
 the
 channel
 a
 couple
 days


ago
 talking
 about
 the
 Nvidia
 Palenter


partnership
 uh
 and
 describing
 what's


going
 on
 there.
 20263


on
 Palunteer.


This
 has
 got
 to
 be
 crazy
 for
 Chad
 too


because
 Chad
 joined
 in
 uh
 June
 of
 23.


Chad
 joined
 about
 two
 years
 ago.
 So,
 and


he
 joined
 when
 the
 stock
 was
 like


literally
 just
 about
 to
 take
 off.
 Like


like
 around
 that
 time
 is
 when
 the
 stock


was
 like
 seven,
 eight
 bucks
 and
 it
 was


just
 getting
 into
 profitability
 and
 we


were
 never
 going
 to
 see
 those
 levels


again.


That's
 when
 he
 joined.
 So,


one
 could
 argue,
 you
 know,
 correlation,


causation,
 Chad's
 here
 now.
 The
 stock


20x's
 like


maybe
 we
 can
 chalk
 it
 up
 to
 him.
 But


just
 an
 incredible,
 incredible
 journey.


Nvidia
 right
 there
 206.
 And
 then
 Tessy


456
 as
 well.


Are
 you
 growing
 it
 out?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


think
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 I'm
 growing
 it


out
 to
 the
 level
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 years


ago,
 but
 it
 is
 pretty
 fast,
 right?
 It's


been
 like
 two
 weeks
 and
 it's
 like
 almost


a
 full
 beard,
 which
 is
 crazy.


But,
 uh,
 yeah,
 we
 are
 growing
 it
 right


now.


Uh,
 AMKR,
 is
 that
 moving?
 Amcor.


Yeah,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right


there.
 All
 right,
 so
 I
 guess
 the
 big


stories
 of
 the
 day
 are
 essentially


Amazon
 and
 Apple
 crushed.
 Earnings
 are


good.
 Broader
 market
 likes
 it.
 S&P
 not


at
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 close
 to
 it.
 Meta


continues
 to
 get
 dumped
 659.


Halente
 200,
 Robin
 Hood
 150,
 Coinbase
 up


10%.


And
 then
 next
 week
 we
 have
 a
 whole


string
 of
 earnings
 to
 see


where
 else
 this
 goes.


I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.


I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 I
 mean,


what
 else?
 What
 else
 do
 we
 got
 right


here?


John,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Uh,
 Aie,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as
 well.
 Pounder


did
 surpass
 Netflix
 on
 Market
 Cap.
 Uh,


Prozzy,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member
 as
 well.
 K
 Roger,
 thanks
 for
 the


$50
 super
 chat.
 Pounder
 at
 200.
 Aids


sister
 is
 gonna
 be
 like,
 "Wow."
 Okay,


bye.


Dude,
 I
 I
 really
 I
 ended
 up
 buying
 more


for
 her
 at
 180.
 I
 haven't
 bought
 for
 her


since
 20.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know what?


At
 180,
 we're
 buying
 more.
 She
 probably


doesn't
 even
 know,
 but


we
 got
 that
 there.
 And
 uh
 Josh,
 thanks


for
 the
 $5
 chat.
 How do
 you
 keep
 track


of
 all
 your
 trades
 for
 your
 taxes?
 Do


you
 use
 an
 online
 journal
 or
 anything?


There
 are
 some
 specific
 trades.
 I
 have


an
 Excel
 sheet
 and
 I
 just
 keep
 track
 of


if
 they're
 like
 larger
 trades.
 In


general,
 I
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 journal


or
 anything
 like
 that.
 Uh
 Robin
 Hood


creates
 your
 tax
 documents
 for
 you.


Every
 brokerage
 does
 this,
 but
 uh
 you


can
 request
 them
 at
 any
 time,
 right?


Even
 before
 tax
 season.
 And
 so
 you
 can


get
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 Excel
 sheet
 and
 a
 CSV


of
 all
 the
 trades
 you've
 made
 with
 your


total
 P&L.


But
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 really
 have
 a


journal.
 I
 don't
 write
 things
 down.
 TJ


writes
 things
 down.
 He
 has
 a
 journal.
 He


writes
 down
 almost
 every
 trade.
 And
 so


for
 some
 people,
 it's
 very
 productive.


But
 for
 other
 people,
 you
 know,
 they


just
 track
 it
 in
 their
 brokerage.


What
 management
 fee
 are
 you
 taking?


taking
 a
 0%
 management
 fee,
 doing
 it
 out


of
 pure
 love,


but
 also,
 you
 know,
 to
 be
 to
 be honest,


it
 gives
 me
 more
 experience
 with


managing
 money
 as
 well.


>> Like,
 I
 would
 never
 charge
 to
 to
 do
 that


for
 my
 sister
 or
 for
 my
 family,
 but
 it


also
 helps
 me
 just
 in
 general


get
 some
 experience
 with
 managing
 money


that's
 not
 my
 money
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 different
 psychology
 when
 you're


managing
 someone
 else's
 money.
 Now,


granted,
 it's
 your
 loved
 one,
 so
 you
 you


almost
 think
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 part


of
 your
 money.
 So
 you
 try
 to
 really
 take


it
 seriously.
 But


no,
 there
 is
 zero
 zero
 management
 fee.


Uh
 yeah,
 legend
 at
 the
 very
 bottom
 shows


your
 year-to-
 date
 profit
 and
 loss.


That's
 true.


Even
 if
 you
 charged
 her,
 you
 wouldn't


notice.
 That's
 also
 true.
 That's
 also


true.


It's
 so
 funny,
 dude.
 My
 mom
 makes
 the


joke
 every
 time.
 It's
 like,
 you
 could
 be


stealing
 money
 from
 your
 sister
 and
 she


would
 never
 know.
 So
 yeah,
 she
 wouldn't.


She
 legit
 wouldn't,


but
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 to


family.
 Siege,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 $20


super
 chat.
 The
 race
 doesn't
 end
 just


because
 the
 year
 is
 coming
 to
 an
 end.


The
 race
 never
 ends.


I
 would
 agree.
 The
 marathon
 we
 are
 on
 in


this
 market
 never
 ends
 and
 it
 looks
 like


the
 momentum
 from
 earnings
 is
 continuing


to
 not
 show
 us
 an
 end.
 Meta
 right
 there


657
 still
 down
 1.3
 very
 close
 to
 low
 of


days
 but
 has
 not
 got
 there
 yet


in
 the
 S&P
 at
 684.


All
 right,
 I
 think
 that's
 it,
 folks.
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 else
 that's


too
 crazy.


I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 anything


not
 seeing
 anything
 too
 wild.
 Uh
 there


was
 some
 headlines
 about
 Trump
 and


Nvidia
 yesterday
 and
 him
 talking
 to


about
 Xi.


Uh
 here's
 one
 thing
 he
 said
 on
 Air
 Force


One
 yesterday.
 Let's
 just
 listen
 to
 this


real
 quick
 about
 Nvidia
 chips.


>> What
 about
 chips,
 sir?
 Did
 uh
 did
 he


agree
 did
 you
 agree
 to
 sell
 any
 more


chips?


>> We
 did
 discuss
 chips
 and
 he's
 going
 to


be
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 to
 Nvidia


and
 others
 about
 taking
 chips.
 Look,
 we


make
 great
 chips.
 Nvidia
 is
 the
 leader


and
 uh
 I'll
 be
 speaking
 to
 Jensen
 from


Dvidia,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 be


discussing
 that
 with
 Dvidia
 to
 see


whether
 or
 not
 they
 can
 do
 I
 said
 that's


really
 between
 you
 and
 Dvidia,
 but
 we're


sort
 of
 the
 arbitrator
 of
 the
 referee.


It's
 a
 little
 rough
 up
 here.
 The
 skies


>> the
 skies
 are
 a
 little
 rough.


>> And
 just
 to
 clarify,
 sir,
 that
 is
 the


the
 downgraded
 Blackwell
 chips.
 You
 you


would
 authorize
 those
 to
 be
 exported?


>> No,
 not
 the
 Blackwell.
 We're
 not
 talking


about
 the
 Blackwell
 that
 just
 came
 out


yesterday.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 chips,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 chips
 and


>> all
 right.
 So
 you
 got
 Trump
 talking


about
 the
 potential
 of
 Nvidia


getting
 to
 sell
 to
 China.
 I
 mean,
 look,


all
 of
 Nvidia's
 guidance
 has
 not
 been


with
 Blackwell
 or
 with
 or
 with
 China.
 So


any
 level
 of
 China
 is
 just
 icing
 on
 the


cake
 and
 obviously
 that
 would
 be
 very


bullish
 for
 Nvidia
 long
 term.


>> All right,
 there
 you
 go.
 That's
 uh


that's
 what
 we
 got
 folks.
 I'll
 be
 back


on
 the
 market
 close.
 Congrats
 to


everybody.
 Palenteer
 200,
 S&P
 up
 half
 a


percent
 on
 the
 day.
 Rob
 trying
 to
 get


back
 to
 150.
 It
 is
 a
 Friday,
 October


31st.


Um
 hopefully
 we
 can
 end
 out
 on
 a
 good


note.
 I
 will
 be
 back
 today
 on
 the
 close.


No
 days
 off
 today
 for
 Friday.


I
 think
 we'll
 get
 Steve
 on,
 maybe
 Matt


on,
 and
 we'll
 have
 our
 normal


uh
 Friday
 market
 close.


That's
 pretty
 much
 it.


That
 is
 pretty
 much
 it.
 Yes,
 I'll
 be


back
 on
 the
 close.
 Not
 gonna
 not
 gonna


have
 an
 excuse
 for
 this
 one,


but
 we'll
 be
 live.
 It
 has
 been
 a
 wild


week.
 Just
 a
 wild
 wild
 week.
 I
 would
 I


would
 imagine
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 alltime


highs
 in
 the
 portfolio
 this
 week
 as


well.


Crazy
 crazy
 week.
 We
 had
 that
 nine
 hour


stream,
 but
 it
 was
 fun.
 It
 was
 a
 fun


week.
 All right,
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 What


do
 we
 got?


Halon.


Halon
 denoting
 a
 period
 of
 time
 in
 the


past
 that
 was


what
 the
 hell
 is
 this
 word?
 Idily,
 happy


and
 peaceful.


Idilicy
 means
 charming,
 peaceful,
 and


perfect.
 Associated
 with
 a
 simple


or
 picturesque
 scene.


Hakon.
 It's
 also
 a
 mythical
 bird.
 Dude,


what
 the
 heck
 is
 this?


How
 do
 you
 say
 this
 [ __ ]


>> Hian.


>> Okay,
 that
 that
 was
 that
 was
 a
 little


off.


Hian.
 Dude,
 the
 C
 and
 the
 Y
 look
 like
 a


C
 sound
 to
 me.


Dude,
 no
 one
 knows
 this
 word.
 No
 one


knows
 this
 word.
 I
 know
 none
 of
 you
 guys


know
 this
 word.
 No
 one's
 heard
 of
 this


word.
 I
 miss
 those
 houseion
 summer
 days


when
 life
 felt
 endless
 and


uncomplicated.
 No
 one
 says
 that
 [ __ ]


bro.
 No
 one's
 ever
 said
 that
 [ __ ]


Houseyian
 summer
 days
 when
 life
 felt


endless
 and
 uncomplicated.
 That's


ridiculous.
 That
 makes
 no
 sense.


Swinging
 a
 miss.
 There
 you
 go.
 Houseion


admit,
 did
 you
 buy
 your
 $200
 pound


share?
 That
 is
 right.
 I
 do
 need
 to
 do


that.
 Let's
 do
 that
 right
 now.
 Someone


did
 send
 a
 $200
 super
 chat
 yesterday.


So,
 let's
 get
 that
 out
 of
 the
 way.


Here
 we
 go.
 Palunteer


first
 buy


in
 the
 two
 hundos.


The
 amount
 of
 times
 I've
 seen
 this


screen.
 Palunteer
 order
 completed.


It
 is
 just
 crazy.


There
 you
 go.
 200.


I
 was
 looking
 at
 it
 the
 other
 day.
 The


lowest
 buy
 I
 got
 was
 640.


But
 I
 was
 broke
 at
 the
 time
 and
 I
 was


already
 down,
 you
 know,
 what
 was
 it?


75%.
 So
 it
 was
 like
 a
 100
 shares.
 So
 it


was
 like
 the
 best
 I
 could
 do
 in
 2022.


Some
 of
 you
 guys
 got
 to
 load
 up
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 shares
 at
 that
 time.
 I
 was


not
 in
 that
 type
 of
 situation.


From
 6
 to
 200.


From
 6
 to
 200.
 All
 right.
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Uh
 we'll
 be


back
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Great
 week.
 If


I
 don't
 see
 you
 on
 the
 market
 close,


I'll
 see
 you
 on
 Pounder
 Weekly.
 if
 you


uh
 join
 then.
 If
 not,
 Sunday
 futures,


it'll
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 Monday
 is
 going
 to


be a
 Super
 Bowl.
 Monday
 is
 gonna
 be
 a


big
 one.
 Monday's
 gonna
 be
 big
 one
 for


two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,
 we
 have


Palunteer,
 which
 is
 always
 big,
 and


that's
 important.
 And
 now
 that
 the
 stock


has
 run
 before
 earnings,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 the
 numbers
 come
 out
 and
 what


ends
 up
 happening
 to
 the
 stock.
 So,


that's
 important.
 And
 also
 because
 the


newest
 addition
 to
 the
 name
 that
 I


really
 associate
 myself
 with
 is
 Grab
 and


that's
 going to
 have
 earnings
 as
 well.


So
 Monday
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very


anxiety
 producing
 day
 for
 me
 across
 the


board
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 it


turns
 out.
 But
 it'll
 be
 a
 big
 week.


Happy
 Halloween
 to
 everybody.
 If
 you


have
 more
 Halloween
 pictures,
 post
 them


on
 Twitter
 and
 tag
 me
 in
 it.
 I
 would


love
 to
 show
 everybody
 on
 the
 screen.


AMD
 next
 week,
 Robin
 Hood
 next
 week.
 I


mean,
 next
 week's
 just
 going
 to
 be


massive.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 And


you
 know,
 we
 had
 a
 successful
 week
 with


earnings,
 successful
 Fed
 meeting.
 Now,


if
 we
 can
 just
 continue
 that,
 it'll
 be


very
 exciting
 to
 keep
 this
 going.
 So


there
 you
 go.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 on


the
 market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Happy


Halloween.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
 See
 you
 on


the
 market
 close.
