[Music]


hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 Good


Company
 I'm
 Nikolai
 tangan
 and
 the
 CEO


of
 the
 Norwegian
 s
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


we
 are
 talking
 to
 W
 saan
 the
 CEO
 of


shell
 now
 most
 of
 us
 associate
 shell


with
 a
 pit
 stop
 on
 the
 road
 but
 shell
 is


an
 incredible
 company
 exploring


producing
 refining
 trading
 transporting


you
 know
 things
 in
 car
 ships
 planes
 and


so
 on
 in
 fact
 I've
 read
 that
 the
 amount


of
 energy
 you
 extract
 in
 one
 day
 is


enough
 to
 drive
 a
 car
 back
 back
 and


forth
 through
 the
 moon
 more
 than
 18,000


times
 we
 own
 3%
 of
 the
 Company


accounting
 for
 more
 than6
 billion
 us
 so


well
 soam
 welcome
 to
 this
 book
 call


thank
 you
 very
 much
 NCA
 now
 you
 are
 um


both
 lebanes
 and
 a
 Canadian
 citizen
 so


tell
 me
 um
 what
 uh
 how
 has
 this
 shaped


you
 as
 a
 person
 you
 think
 uh
 look
 I


think
 uh
 diversity
 of
 thought
 diversity


of
 experiences
 is
 at
 the
 core
 I
 suspect


of
 how
 I've
 grown
 up
 um
 I
 I
 actually


lived
 uh
 only
 5
 years
 in
 Canada
 and
 I've


never
 lived
 in
 Lebanon
 yet
 of
 course


both
 have
 had
 tremendous
 influence


through
 through
 culture
 what
 they
 have


done
 has
 made
 me
 uh
 accept
 the
 different


perspectives
 that
 people
 have
 in


different
 contexts
 and
 to
 learn
 from


that
 um
 and
 I
 think
 most
 importantly
 to


build
 resilience
 um
 the
 Lebanese


unfortunately
 are
 known
 for
 resilience


given
 the
 many
 challenges
 the
 country


has
 had
 and
 I
 think
 resilience
 is
 what


we
 need
 in
 particular
 in
 times
 of
 change


as
 we
 currently
 have
 geopolitically
 in


the
 energy
 system
 and
 beyond
 now
 we
 live


in
 a
 society
 now
 where
 there
 is
 in
 many


cases
 very
 little
 resilience
 do
 you


think
 that
 background
 uh
 really
 has


given
 you
 more
 resilience
 I
 believe
 so
 I


I
 think
 unfortunately
 uh
 one
 only
 gets


to
 appreciate
 what
 one's
 H
 what
 one
 has


when
 it's
 taken
 away
 from
 them
 and
 often


I
 always
 take
 my
 kids
 back
 to
 Lebanon
 to


see
 my
 father
 and
 my
 wife's
 parents
 um


and
 it's
 when
 they
 are
 in
 Lebanon
 that


they
 get
 appreciate
 some
 of
 the
 luxuries


that
 they
 enjoy
 having
 lived
 in
 Europe


in
 the
 US
 even
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the


Middle
 East
 simple
 thing
 like
 when
 they


take
 a
 lift
 um
 when
 it's
 in
 Lebanon
 they


know
 not
 to
 take
 the
 lifts
 because


unfortunately
 typically
 the
 lift
 gets


stopped
 because
 of
 power
 cuts
 um
 or
 they


get
 used
 to
 for
 example
 sometimes
 the


lights
 going
 out
 for
 an
 hour
 or
 two


hours
 because
 the
 generator
 that
 has


been
 driving
 the
 company
 the
 building's


uh
 utilities
 goes


down
 but
 gotten
 used
 to
 a
 bit
 more
 of


that
 and
 I


think
 those
 small
 elements
 of


appreciation
 of
 what
 we
 have
 what
 the


Energy
 System
 of
 today's
 world
 actually


can
 do
 to
 be
 able
 to
 deliver
 the


Comforts
 that
 we
 all
 enjoy
 we
 should


never
 take
 for
 granted
 it's
 such
 a
 core


part
 of
 what
 we
 all
 I
 think
 enjoy
 in


life
 at
 least
 majority
 of
 us
 enjoy
 in


life
 um
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 still
 just


do
 not
 have
 that
 that
 access
 to
 energy


700
 million
 people
 today
 live
 without


access
 to
 electricity
 some
 2
 and
 a
 half


billion
 in
 general
 do
 not
 have
 access
 to


available
 cooking
 uh
 fuels
 and
 the
 like


so
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 elements
 that
 I


think
 we
 shouldn't
 forget
 now
 you
 have
 a


background
 as
 a
 chemical
 engineer
 and


you've
 been
 at
 Shell
 for
 26
 years
 and


bang
 you
 are
 the


CEO
 um
 what
 are
 the
 advantages
 of
 having


spent
 so
 long
 time
 in
 a
 company
 before


you
 take
 over
 look
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 the
 context
 of


the
 company
 its
 history
 its
 present
 and


the
 Ambitions
 to
 go
 into
 the
 future
 and


it's
 tougher
 to
 do
 that
 if
 haven't


actually
 gotten
 to
 see
 the
 company
 from


within
 as
 you
 rightly
 say
 I
 I
 am
 a


chemical
 engineer
 that's
 allowed
 Me


Maybe
 the
 biggest
 learning
 I
 have
 from


chemical
 engineering
 is
 to
 understand


systems
 uh
 endtoend
 systems
 because


that's
 what
 the
 energy
 system
 is
 you


need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 look
 not
 just
 at
 what


one
 end
 of
 it
 whether
 that's
 the
 supply


side
 or
 the
 demand
 side
 it's
 the
 all
 the


whole
 integrated
 value
 chain
 from
 Supply


through
 the
 Midstream
 infrastructure
 all


the
 way
 to
 the
 demand
 side
 and
 how
 it


all
 comes
 together
 that
 plays
 in


technology
 that
 plays
 in
 product
 flows


it
 plays
 across
 the
 entire
 patch
 and
 I


think
 chemical
 engineering
 is
 a
 great


field
 to
 be
 able
 to
 learn
 about
 that
 and


having
 been
 in
 Shell
 for
 some
 26
 27


years
 now
 and
 worked
 in
 the
 Upstream


worked
 in
 the
 gas
 part
 of
 the
 company


worked
 in
 the
 downstream
 in
 the
 retail


part
 of
 the
 company
 and
 worked
 in
 the


Renewables
 part
 of
 the
 company
 as
 well


it
 allows
 you
 to
 start
 to
 see
 how
 the


pieces
 fit
 together
 into
 a
 hole
 so


you've
 been
 you've
 been
 Sono
 for
 one


year
 what
 was
 the
 big
 surprise
 taking


over
 the
 Reigns
 look
 I
 think
 there
 is


something
 fundamentally
 different
 as
 you


grow
 through
 the
 company
 where
 of
 course


your
 overall
 requirement
 in
 terms
 of


time
 spent
 and
 the
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


understand
 grow
 but
 suddenly
 becoming


the
 face
 of
 the
 company
 both
 internally


and
 externally
 of
 course
 I'd
 appreciate


it
 I'd
 intellectualized
 but
 it's
 very


different
 when
 you
 actually
 get
 into


that
 position
 and
 you
 recognize
 how


important
 every
 action
 is
 how
 important


every
 word
 is
 because
 people
 are
 looking


at
 that
 how
 long
 did
 shell
 um
 groom
 you


for
 the
 Zoll
 I
 I
 suspect
 I
 mean
 the
 day


that
 I
 got
 onto
 the
 executive
 committee


in


2019
 um
 of
 course
 created
 a
 step
 change


in
 the
 profile
 in
 the
 company
 um
 but
 I


suspect
 it
 was
 before
 that
 I
 mean
 I
 had


maybe
 my
 most
 defining
 period
 was
 in


2012
 when
 I
 was
 given
 the
 opportunity
 to


lead
 our
 Ki
 business
 I
 was
 in
 Doha
 at


the
 time
 and
 I
 stepped
 a
 ro
 which
 if
 I


was
 if
 I'm
 honest
 with
 you
 Nikolai
 I


thought
 to
 myself
 I
 think
 they've
 gotten


the
 wrong
 guy
 for
 this
 job
 this
 is
 just


too


big
 and
 you
 and
 was
 and
 was
 it
 too
 big
 I


mean
 the
 first
 six
 months
 uh
 you
 know
 I


uh
 I
 lost
 around
 four
 five
 kilograms
 cuz


I
 was
 just
 from
 5
 in
 the
 morning
 to


midnight
 just
 working
 and
 working
 and


working
 more
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to
 know


the
 people
 we
 had
 1,600
 people
 on
 site


um
 and
 I
 I
 before
 I
 took
 over
 that
 job
 I


was
 running
 the
 commercial
 and
 new


business
 team
 of
 around
 20
 people
 so
 I


had
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 and
 not
 just


getting
 to
 know
 them
 by
 giving
 speeches


getting
 to
 know
 them
 by
 going
 to


understand
 their
 business
 to
 understand


their
 their
 challenges
 their
 dilemmas


and
 then
 building
 trust
 um
 and
 I
 think


that
 leadership


Journey
 uh
 gave
 shell
 the
 opportunity
 to


be
 able
 to
 say
 let's
 let's
 see
 whether


this
 person
 can
 be
 one
 of
 the
 many


terrific
 candidates
 that
 one
 day
 could


lead
 chill
 and
 why
 do
 they
 pick
 you
 at


the
 end
 I
 think
 what
 I
 brought
 at
 this


point
 in
 time
 in
 Shell
 is
 we
 felt
 our


strategy
 was
 clear
 and
 my
 track
 record


of
 execution
 was
 an
 important
 part
 of
 I


think
 what
 the
 board
 was
 looking
 for
 so


then
 um
 you're
 appointed
 Co
 what
 what
 um


advice
 would
 you
 give
 to
 people
 who
 are


who
 get
 into
 those
 type
 of
 situations
 so


I
 mean
 what
 did
 you
 what
 did
 you
 do
 in


the
 beginning
 a
 very
 important
 piece
 of


advice
 I
 got
 early
 on
 was
 in
 particular


coming
 from
 the
 company
 and
 having
 spent


26
 years
 from
 in
 the
 company
 the
 advice


was
 approach
 it
 as
 if
 if
 you
 were
 an


external
 hire
 don't
 get
 too
 comfortable


with
 what
 you've
 grown
 up
 in
 the


paradigms
 the
 sacred
 cows
 that
 you
 have


adopted
 in
 your
 26
 27
 years
 in
 the


company
 approach
 it
 like
 an
 external
 CEO


will
 and
 that
 was
 great
 advice
 actually


just
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 the


fundamentals
 really
 look
 at
 the


comparators
 and
 say
 where
 are
 we


actually
 winning
 and
 where
 are
 we
 not


and
 that
 allowed
 me
 as
 well
 to
 sort
 of


lift
 myself
 from
 this
 is
 the


organizational
 structure
 we
 have
 today


let's
 continue
 with
 it
 to
 no
 let's


challenge
 that
 organizational
 structure


let's
 challenge
 the
 destination
 that


we're
 going
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 we


continue
 to
 be
 absolutely
 committed
 to


that
 destination
 let's
 challenge
 the
 way


we
 execute
 let's
 challenge
 how
 we


execute
 as
 a
 company
 as
 well
 all
 of
 that


was
 an
 important
 piece
 of
 coming
 in
 and


I
 would
 recommend
 it
 to
 anyone
 uh
 it's


just
 too
 easy
 to
 fall
 into
 the
 lull
 of


this
 is
 how
 it's
 always
 been
 this
 is


this
 is
 therefore
 how
 it's
 always
 need


to
 needs
 to
 be
 so
 you
 launched
 an


efficiency
 program
 and
 also
 started
 to
 C


cut
 some
 costs
 um
 tell
 me
 about
 the


program
 we
 called
 it
 a
 Sprint
 um
 a
 10


quarter
 Sprint
 and
 the
 reason
 we
 chose


10
 quarters
 is
 in
 our
 industry
 you
 could


easily
 sort
 of
 promise
 things
 at
 5
 10


years
 just
 given
 the
 uh
 the
 gestation
 of


many
 of
 our
 projects
 we
 didn't
 feel
 that


we
 as
 a
 new
 management
 team
 could
 uh


simply
 ask
 people
 to
 trust
 us
 we
 needed


to
 be
 able
 to
 show
 them
 they
 can
 trust


us
 and
 therefore
 10
 quarters
 was


measurable
 was
 clear
 while
 still
 giving


us
 enough
 time
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 the


changes
 that
 we
 needed
 to
 make
 and
 we


Tred
 to
 simplify
 the
 focus
 for
 the


organization
 and
 for
 everyone
 outside
 to


say
 there's
 a
 couple
 things
 we're
 trying


to
 do
 more
 value
 and
 less
 emissions
 so


every
 decision
 needs
 to
 reflect
 on
 the


impact
 we
 can
 have
 on
 either
 enhancing


value
 or
 reducing
 emissions
 which
 should


be
 relatively


straightforward
 and
 so
 what
 we've
 done


as
 part
 of
 that
 Sprint
 is
 we've


simplified
 the
 top
 of
 the
 house
 we
 had


nine
 executive
 committee
 members
 we've


leveled
 that
 down
 to
 to
 to
 seven
 M
 we


had
 multiple
 targets
 we
 had
 over
 75


operational
 financial
 and
 car
 and
 carbon


targets
 we've
 reduced
 that
 to
 eight
 four


financial
 and
 four
 carbon
 making
 it
 very


clear
 to
 the
 organization
 what
 it
 is


that
 we
 want
 we
 upped
 the
 performance


Cadence
 speed
 we
 have
 gone
 now
 into


bi-weekly
 and
 monthly
 performance


cadences
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 house
 and


that
 is
 even
 more
 frequent
 as
 you
 go


deeper
 into
 the
 organization
 allowing
 us


to
 become
 much
 clearer
 on
 do
 you
 have


the
 data
 that
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


understand
 whether
 we're
 making
 progress


is
 that
 data
 showing
 that
 we
 are
 making


progress
 where
 are
 interventions


required
 so
 this
 is
 a
 a
 bels
 and


braces
 um
 transformation
 of
 the
 company


um
 a
 company
 that
 has
 a
 great
 culture


but
 one
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 supplemented


with
 these
 three
 key
 elements
 of


performance
 discipline
 and


simplification
 MH
 you
 do
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 at
 Shell
 where
 are
 you


the
 number
 one
 there's
 a
 few
 areas
 that


I
 think
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to
 demonstrate


leadership
 one
 is
 in
 deep
 water
 um
 we're


very
 pleased
 with
 our
 position
 and
 more


importantly
 in
 the
 way
 we
 continue
 to


execute
 new
 projects
 such
 as
 in
 the
 Gulf


of
 Mexico
 we've
 recently
 um
 commissioned


our
 veto
 project
 we're
 in
 the
 process
 of


uh
 working
 up
 our
 whale
 project
 our


Sparta
 project
 so
 that's
 a
 real


Heartland
 for
 us
 as
 is
 Brazil
 in
 the


context
 of
 deporter
 LNG
 would
 be
 another


area
 that
 I
 think
 we
 have
 excelled
 at
 we


are
 um
 after
 Q
 energy
 the
 largest
 player


in
 LG
 the
 single
 largest
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


the
 international
 oil
 and
 gas
 companies


uh
 so
 that's
 an
 area
 where
 we
 do
 have


real
 strength
 and
 an
 area
 where
 we
 see


the
 world
 really
 needing
 a
 huge
 amount


of
 gas
 and
 LG
 in
 particular
 if
 we
 are
 to


decarbonize
 in
 the
 direction
 we
 would


hope
 we
 go
 another
 area
 I
 think
 we
 are


particularly
 strong
 at
 is
 trading
 uh
 we


have
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 trading
 and


optimization
 houses
 in
 the
 energy
 sector


anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 um
 and
 maybe
 the


last
 one
 I'd
 mention
 is
 our
 marketing


organization
 you
 started
 off
 by


referencing
 the
 brand
 and
 the
 pit
 stop


as
 you
 go
 around
 we
 have
 46,000
 stations


around
 the
 world
 well
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I've


eaten
 uh
 hot
 dogs
 in
 many
 of
 them
 and


well
 they're
 good
 right
 good
 that's
 an


important


feedback
 now
 um
 where
 are
 you
 weak
 where


are
 we
 weak
 um
 I
 think
 in
 certain
 areas


we
 have
 tried
 to
 play
 uh
 and
 we
 have


shown
 ourselves
 that
 maybe
 we're
 not
 the


best
 players
 one
 area
 for
 example
 is


trying
 to
 play
 purely
 the
 renewable


generation
 space
 uh
 we've
 tried
 there
 we


haven't
 been
 able
 to
 see
 that
 we
 can
 be


competitive
 in
 just
 the
 renewable


generation
 part
 why
 because
 I
 think
 this


is
 doesn't
 require
 the
 same
 complex


systems
 it's
 different
 risk
 profile
 um


and
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 play
 to
 what


we
 bring
 and
 what
 we
 typically
 bring
 is


big
 project
 management
 capability


integration
 of
 different
 parts
 of
 a


value
 chain
 if
 you
 take
 solar
 panel


installation
 it's
 a
 relatively
 basic


element
 but
 I'll
 give
 you
 more
 a
 more


specific
 example
 in
 that
 context
 we
 were


looking
 at
 energy
 access
 in
 Africa
 for


example
 trying
 to
 install
 solar
 panels


there
 uh
 for
 for
 folks
 who
 don't
 have


access
 to
 it
 what
 ended
 up
 H
 happening


is
 we
 would
 need
 in
 essence
 the
 vehicle


that's
 transporting
 the
 solar
 panel
 to


be
 surrounded
 by
 two
 safety
 vehicles
 to


be
 able
 to
 follow
 our
 safety
 protocols


we
 needed
 harnesses
 by
 the
 time
 the


person
 got
 to
 the
 roof
 of
 the
 house
 in


which
 he
 was
 installing
 that
 panel


that's
 very
 different
 than
 what
 others


would
 do
 and
 so
 we
 were
 actually
 dis


synergizing
 on
 the
 cost
 structure
 and
 so


we've
 said
 look
 let's
 not
 play
 in
 that


space
 let's
 play
 across
 the
 integrated


value
 chain
 and
 partner
 in
 that
 part
 of


the
 value
 chain
 the
 renewable
 generation


with
 others
 so
 does
 it
 mean
 that
 you


think
 that
 the
 integrated
 energy


companies
 should
 not
 be
 doing
 solar
 no
 I


think
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 solar
 bring


in
 the
 partners
 who
 are
 excellent
 at


doing
 solar
 and
 decide
 why
 you
 want
 to


play
 in
 the
 Solar
 space
 is
 there
 really


any
 synergies
 between
 solar
 and
 other


types
 of
 energy
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


Synergy
 is
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Energy


System
 more
 holistically
 what
 we
 see
 at


the
 moment
 is
 take
 the
 us
 where
 we
 are


one
 of
 the
 largest
 players
 in
 gas
 and


power
 we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 decarbonize


our
 sales
 of
 electricity
 in
 that


market
 as
 well
 as
 decarbonize
 both
 the


gas
 and
 the
 power
 what
 you
 find
 right


now
 is
 you
 cannot
 get
 access
 to
 Green


electrons
 because
 there
 aren't
 enough
 of


them
 so
 we
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 play


sufficiently
 in
 the
 green
 energy
 space


in
 the
 green
 electron
 space


develop
 it
 at
 some
 point
 we
 can
 dilute


it
 down
 to
 keep
 a
 20%
 Equity
 interest


but
 then
 take
 a
 disproportionately


larger
 amount
 of
 the
 green
 electrons


which
 we
 can
 put
 into
 our
 system
 many
 of


our
 B2B
 customers
 whom
 we
 serve
 with


lubricants
 we
 serve
 with
 gas
 we
 serve


with
 all
 sorts
 of
 energy
 products
 are


demanding
 green
 electricity
 to
 to
 come


to
 them
 as
 the
 largest
 energy
 Trader
 and


to
 say
 well
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 wouldn't


be
 the
 right
 approach
 and
 therefore


we're
 trying
 to
 leverage
 our
 strength
 to


be
 able
 to
 bring
 into
 at
 Green
 Green


electrons
 to
 the
 system
 should
 wind
 be


done
 by
 the
 integrated
 energy
 companies


again
 I
 think
 playing
 to
 one
 strength
 on


off
 on
 onshore
 wind
 it's
 tougher
 to
 see


what
 particular
 we
 would
 bring
 on
 the


offshore
 side
 there's
 more
 logic
 to
 be


had
 for
 the
 big
 players
 in
 particular


given
 our
 deep
 water
 experience
 and
 the


more
 complex
 element
 of
 offshore
 wind
 so


what
 part
 will
 shell
 actually
 play
 in


the
 enery
 transition
 I
 think
 the
 role
 we


play
 right
 now
 is
 to
 be
 a
 multi
 energy


player
 so
 we
 see
 ourselves
 continuing
 to


produce
 lower
 and
 lower
 carbon
 oil
 we


see
 ourselves
 being
 the
 movers
 of
 the


largest
 amount
 of
 LG
 amongst
 the
 majors


but
 then
 we
 see
 ourselves
 playing
 across


lower
 carbon
 Solutions
 both
 in
 terms
 of


lower
 carbon
 molecular
 Solutions
 and


where
 appropriate
 lower
 carbon
 green


electron
 Solutions
 and
 what
 do
 I
 mean
 by


that
 we
 see
 ourselves
 playing
 in
 areas


such
 as
 one
 day
 green
 hydrogen
 we
 are


developing
 the
 largest
 green
 hydrogen


facility
 in
 Europe
 at
 the
 moment
 in
 r
 to


them
 we
 see
 ourselves
 playing
 in
 the


biospace
 in
 low
 carbon
 fuels
 we
 are
 the


single
 largest
 blender
 of
 biofuels
 in


the
 world
 today
 we
 see
 ourselves
 playing


in
 in
 other
 areas
 as
 well
 such
 as
 for


example
 carbon
 capture
 and
 sequestration


which
 is
 an
 area
 we've
 been
 working


including
 for
 example
 in
 Norway
 in
 the


Northern
 Lights
 project
 um
 and
 we
 see


ourselves
 as
 being
 able
 to
 offer
 our


customers
 nature-based
 solution
 for


example
 carbon
 credits
 and
 the
 like
 so


really
 looking
 at
 the
 holistic
 system


but
 focusing
 on
 the
 areas
 where
 we
 have


differentiated
 capabilities
 and


competitive
 strengths
 now
 you
 Tred
 to


develop
 both
 e
 uh
 both
 electrical


vehicle
 charging
 and
 biofuel
 does
 it


make
 sense
 to
 kind
 of
 ride
 both
 those


horses
 I
 think
 it
 does
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 there
 are
 two
 major


sectors
 that
 we
 um
 we
 serve
 today
 the


transport
 sector
 whether
 that's


passenger
 vehicles
 Commercial
 Road


Transport
 Aviation
 or
 shipping
 as
 well


as
 the
 industrial


sectors
 they
 both
 need
 different
 things


so
 for
 example
 passenger
 vehicles
 needs


EV
 charging
 so
 while
 we
 have
 been


selling
 traditionally
 gasoline
 and


Diesel
 we
 see
 a
 growing
 pool
 of
 demand


for
 EV
 charging
 and
 so
 we
 can
 actually


synergize
 with
 our
 existing
 retail
 sites


and
 add
 the
 option
 of
 EV
 charging


whereas
 biofuels
 are
 slightly
 different


biofuels
 we
 see
 much
 more
 akin
 to


playing
 to
 our
 customers
 in
 the
 shipping


space
 in
 the
 Aviation
 Space
 with


sustainable
 Aviation
 fuels
 and
 in
 the


commercial
 Road
 Transport
 space
 now
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 are
 trying
 trying
 to


reposition
 themselves
 as
 you
 know


integrated
 um
 renewable
 companies
 and
 so


on
 um
 and
 I
 think
 what's
 interesting
 is


that
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 rewarding
 them


in
 different
 ways
 depending
 on
 when
 they


come
 with
 various
 types
 of
 announcements


so
 at
 some
 stage
 is
 very
 good
 to
 spend


more
 time
 on
 Renewables
 and
 then


companies
 change
 tax
 and
 say
 they're


going
 to
 do
 less
 of
 it
 and
 then
 the


share
 prices
 go
 up
 on
 it
 I
 mean
 how
 how


do
 stock
 markets
 shape
 what
 you
 think
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 listen
 to


shareholders
 But
 ultimately
 we
 are
 also


driving
 a
 long-term
 strategy
 and
 I
 don't


think
 the
 two
 are
 in
 Conflict
 what


shareholders
 are
 saying
 is
 show
 me
 that


you
 have
 investable
 business
 models
 that


allow
 me
 to
 continue
 to
 see
 cash
 flow


growth
 in
 this
 company
 that
 allow
 me
 to


have
 the
 appropriate
 shareholder
 returns


yeah
 but
 that's
 what
 they're
 saying
 now


but
 they
 didn't
 say
 that
 3
 four
 years


ago
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 much
 broader


context
 you're
 absolutely
 right
 three


four
 years
 ago
 the
 narrative
 and
 not


just
 by


shareholders
 by
 actually
 a
 significant


portion
 of
 society
 more
 acutely
 here
 in


North
 West
 Europe
 yeah
 we
 heard
 very


very
 loud
 concerns
 around
 any
 oil
 and


gas
 production
 so
 if
 we
 now
 go
 back
 to


such
 a
 period
 and
 you
 get
 that
 same
 kind


of
 political
 pressure
 back
 will
 you


change
 your
 targets
 and
 what
 you
 aim
 for


I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 be
 a
 company


that's
 um
 in
 essence
 the
 distillation
 of


all
 the
 asks
 of
 everyone
 around
 around


the
 world
 because
 in
 a
 world
 that
 is


particularly
 polarized
 today


geopolitically
 economically
 socially


what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is
 to
 be
 very
 clear


on
 who
 we
 want
 to
 be
 as
 a
 company
 but


that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 do
 not
 evolve


your
 strategy
 depending
 on
 where
 you
 see


value
 pools
 and
 where
 you
 see
 strengths


we
 thought
 we
 could
 potentially
 play
 in


home
 energy
 and
 selling
 power
 to
 homes


that
 didn't
 work
 out
 for
 us
 so
 we
 had
 to


change
 we
 can't
 simply
 keep
 doing
 the


things
 that
 are
 not
 working
 for
 us
 but


we
 need
 to
 be
 transparent
 around
 that
 so


the
 number
 one
 thing
 for
 me
 is
 be
 very


clear
 with
 our
 shareholders
 what
 our


intent
 is
 give
 them
 as
 much
 opportunity


to
 be
 able
 to
 measure
 our
 progress
 as
 as


we
 can
 and
 then
 let
 them
 make
 the


choices
 I
 cannot
 influence
 the
 decision


of
 somebody
 who
 is
 simply
 wanting
 to
 bet


on
 oil
 that's
 not
 the
 company
 that
 shell


is
 nor
 are
 we
 a
 company
 that's
 simply


going
 to
 be
 an
 offshore
 wind
 company
 or


a
 Solar
 Company
 we
 want
 to
 be
 the


investment
 case
 through
 the
 energy


transition
 offering
 multiple
 energy


vectors
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 think
 we
 are


the
 investment
 case
 for
 and
 that's
 what


we
 hope
 to
 be
 able
 to
 appeal
 to
 our


shareholders
 with
 how
 important
 is
 a


continuation
 of
 the
 inflation
 reduction


act
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 critical
 element
 and


and
 the
 reason
 I
 say
 that
 is
 one
 it


creates
 um
 allow
 me
 to
 say
 fomo
 uh
 you


know
 fear
 of
 missing
 out
 by
 many
 others


around
 the
 world
 and
 you
 see
 actually


the
 inflation
 reduction
 act
 has
 inspired


a
 few
 other
 acts
 around
 the
 world
 for


example
 the
 EU
 fit
 for
 55
 that
 um
 became


stronger
 and
 better
 on
 the
 back
 of
 the


inflation
 reduction
 act
 but
 it
 also
 is


going
 to
 be
 critical
 to
 make
 sure
 that


the
 implementation
 of
 the
 inflation


reduction
 act
 continues
 as
 planned
 the


risk
 is
 in
 what
 are
 long
 investment


Horizons
 that
 significant
 change
 in
 the


fiscal
 and
 the
 regulatory
 framework


could
 undermine
 confidence
 in
 these


Investments
 now
 the
 CEO
 of
 um
 Saudi


Arabian
 oil
 company
 said
 recently
 that


it's
 time
 to
 abandon
 the
 fantasy
 of


facing
 out
 out
 oil
 and
 gas
 is
 is
 it
 a


fantasy
 to
 think
 we'll
 face
 it
 out
 I


think
 in
 the
 coming
 years
 one
 has
 to
 be


pragmatic
 and
 look
 at
 the
 realities
 we


see
 oil
 and
 gas
 is
 a
 critical
 part
 of


the
 energy
 system
 in
 fact
 fossil
 fuels


today
 are
 over
 80%
 of
 the
 energy
 system


so
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to


continue
 to
 find
 Pathways
 to
 reduce
 the


dependence
 on
 fossil
 fuels
 but
 it's


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 an
 informed
 energy


transition
 that
 does
 not
 take
 away


resources
 from
 people
 that
 need
 it
 but


is
 it
 but
 is
 it
 actually
 a
 transition


aren't
 we
 just
 adding
 one
 energy
 source


onto
 the
 other
 energy
 source
 we
 are


today
 yeah
 you're
 right
 are
 today
 and


and
 that
 and
 when
 do
 you
 think
 oil
 and


gas
 will
 start
 to
 decline
 uh
 I
 think
 gas


has
 a
 long
 way
 to
 go
 uh
 I
 think
 for
 the


next
 you
 know
 at
 least
 through
 the
 2040s


we
 see
 a
 growing
 role
 for
 gas
 uh
 as


either
 a
 replacement
 for
 coal
 or


critically
 as
 well
 as
 a
 support
 as
 a


supplement
 to
 uh
 Renewables
 because
 of


the
 intermittency
 of
 Renewables
 um
 oil


products
 I
 think
 will
 continue
 to
 grow


through
 this
 decade
 and
 possibly
 by
 as


early
 as
 the
 next
 decade
 we
 could
 start


to
 see
 a
 peing
 of
 uh
 of
 all
 products


demand
 uh
 but
 who
 knows
 that's
 going
 to


depend
 on
 demand
 levels
 what
 we
 see


right
 now
 is
 there
 are
 new
 sources
 of


energy
 demand
 that
 we
 hadn't
 anticipated


just
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 like
 generative
 AI


like
 crypto
 mining
 all
 of
 that
 is


actually
 enhancing
 the
 demand
 for
 energy


rather
 than
 reducing
 it
 and
 that's
 an


issue
 ownership
 dialogue
 so
 we
 have


great
 dialogue
 um
 with
 you
 with
 with
 you


guys
 um
 and
 we
 appreciate
 that
 you


really
 engage
 with
 us
 uh
 um
 now
 how
 do


you
 think
 about
 stakeholder
 engagement


when
 it
 comes
 to
 things
 like
 your
 latest


climate
 package
 I
 I
 think
 it's


absolutely
 critical
 to
 be
 first
 and


foremost
 transparent
 in
 everything
 one


does
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 clear
 what
 we


stand
 for
 as
 a
 company
 uh
 and
 then
 to


share
 it
 with
 our
 shareholders
 I
 think


then
 dialogue
 is
 critical
 with
 those
 who


agree
 with
 you
 of
 which
 there
 are
 many


and
 with
 those
 who
 disagree
 with
 us


again
 of
 which
 there
 are
 many
 so
 on
 the


day
 that
 we
 announced
 our
 energy


transition
 strategy
 report
 which
 was


just
 3
 weeks
 ago
 um
 I
 had
 time
 dedicated


to
 engagement
 with
 staff
 across
 the


company
 time
 dedicated
 to
 engagement


with
 shareholders
 time
 dedicated
 to


engagements
 with
 what
 we
 would
 call


climate
 influencers
 from
 around
 the


world
 uh
 non-governmental
 organizations


who
 have
 a
 very
 very
 strong
 view
 on
 the


energy
 transition
 not
 necessarily
 always


an
 aligned
 view
 but
 good
 important


different
 views
 which
 I
 think
 it's


critical
 for
 us
 as
 a
 company
 to
 be


listening
 to
 to
 be
 learning
 from
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 increasingly
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


legal
 activity
 in
 in
 this
 field
 and
 of


course
 the
 big
 one
 being
 whether


individual
 companies
 need
 to
 share
 the


legal
 obligations
 of
 states
 in
 terms
 of


cutting
 emissions
 and
 you're
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 big
 uh
 a
 big
 lawsuit
 here
 uh


how
 do
 you
 think
 this
 will
 pan
 out


because
 it's
 quite
 it's
 quite
 key
 to


your
 future
 right
 yeah
 so
 I
 think
 that


you
 touch
 on
 a
 couple
 questions
 there
 I


think
 one
 element
 of
 this
 is
 what
 is
 it


that
 you
 own
 as
 a
 company
 we
 are
 firmly


of
 a
 belief
 that
 we
 have
 accountability


for
 our
 own
 emissions
 what
 we
 would


typically
 call
 scope
 one
 and
 extend
 it


into
 scope
 two
 those
 are
 the
 emissions


that
 we
 produce
 from
 our
 own
 activities


or
 which
 come
 directly
 into
 the
 S
 where


we
 produce
 we
 also
 think
 there's
 a


responsibility
 that
 companies
 like
 ours


have
 towards
 scope
 3
 which
 is
 why
 we


adopted
 scope
 3
 targets
 and
 Ambitions


recognizing
 we
 don't
 have
 all
 the
 levers


to
 be
 able
 to
 influence
 the
 scope
 3


numbers
 but
 feeling
 that
 if
 we
 can
 lean


into
 to
 that
 and
 set
 some
 goals
 there


it'll
 allow
 us
 to
 work
 with
 our


customers
 to
 shape
 that
 those
 products


that
 we
 are
 selling
 so
 that's
 an


important
 element
 so
 just
 to
 so
 just
 to


explain
 here
 scope
 three
 is
 basically


the
 uh
 pollution
 uh
 caused
 by
 the
 oil


sell
 it's
 it's
 the
 emissions
 of
 any


product
 we
 sell
 to
 our
 customer
 but
 the


emission
 is
 realized
 when
 the
 customer


uses
 the
 product
 so
 it's
 not
 you
 but
 the


customers
 correct
 so
 today
 if
 we
 sell
 uh


you
 gasoline
 for
 example
 to
 fuel
 your


car
 uh
 when
 you
 drive
 that
 car
 roughly


90%
 of
 the
 emissions
 are
 actually


generated
 versus
 the
 less
 than
 10%


emissions
 generated
 in
 the
 entire
 value


chain
 all
 the
 way
 from
 producing
 the
 oil


to
 delivering
 it
 to
 your
 car
 yeah
 and
 so


the
 question
 is
 how
 do
 we
 work
 with
 our


customers
 to
 support
 them
 on
 their


decarbonization
 Journey
 the
 example
 I


just
 gave
 could
 be
 that
 we
 set
 up
 an
 EV


charging
 point
 for
 our
 customers
 at
 the


point
 that
 they
 want
 to
 invest
 in
 an
 EV


uh
 another
 Point
 could
 be
 we
 offer
 them


a
 bio
 blend
 so
 that
 we
 reduce
 the


emission
 of
 their
 vehicle
 we
 can
 sell


them
 lubricants
 that
 allow
 us
 to
 also


reduce
 the
 emissions
 from
 the
 from
 the


use
 of
 the
 the
 vehicle
 so
 there
 are


multiple
 levers
 we
 could
 potentially


apply
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 all
 the
 levers


of
 control
 only
 Nicolai
 can
 choose
 if


you
 want
 to
 buy
 an
 EV
 or
 not
 those
 are


choices
 that
 the
 customers
 have
 to
 make


and
 so
 that's
 that's
 how
 we
 think
 about


that
 now
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 to
 the


lawsuit
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


the
 end
 point
 we're
 trying
 to
 all
 drive


towards
 is
 decarbonization
 and
 making


sure
 that
 we
 ear
 urgently
 act
 on
 the


worst
 impacts
 of
 climate
 change
 which
 is


happening
 around
 us
 we
 experience
 it


today
 day
 in
 day


out
 now
 the
 question
 is
 what
 is
 the
 best


approach
 is
 it
 is
 it
 right
 to
 put
 the


obligation
 on
 a
 single
 company
 in


Europe
 or
 is
 it
 right
 to
 do
 it
 much
 more


as
 elected
 governments
 choosing
 how
 they


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 set
 those
 policies


for
 Industries
 to
 then
 respond
 that's
 a


core
 point
 of
 contention
 that
 we
 have
 in


our
 in
 our
 lawsuit
 um
 it's
 not
 right


just


for
 a
 shell
 to
 have
 the
 obligation


without
 our
 customers
 having
 that
 same


obligation
 um
 the
 second
 key
 element
 is


it's
 not
 right
 for
 a
 court
 to
 actually


determine
 the
 strategy
 of
 the
 company


that's
 a
 question
 that
 has
 to
 be
 left
 to


the
 board
 so
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the


elements
 that
 we
 are
 uh
 that
 we
 are


discussing
 in
 this
 uh
 or
 that
 we
 are
 um


supporting
 in
 the
 lawsuit
 and
 we
 hope
 to


have
 a
 bit
 more
 insights
 we're
 actually


through
 the
 appeal
 process
 over
 the
 last


week
 and
 there's
 we
 expect
 to
 hear
 back


towards
 end
 of
 the
 year
 irrespective
 of


that
 we
 continue
 to
 focus
 on
 what
 we
 can


control
 which
 is
 the
 way
 we
 run
 the


company
 and
 how
 we
 actually
 adhere
 but


to
 some
 of
 the
 key
 elements
 that
 we
 have


committed
 to
 doing
 but
 we
 also
 have
 some


other
 activity
 in
 the
 in
 this
 space
 so


Exxon
 is
 suing
 activist
 shareholders
 you


are
 suing
 Green
 Peace
 um
 what
 is
 this


about
 look
 at
 I
 can
 talk
 about
 what
 we


are
 doing
 we
 fundamentally
 believe
 in


everyone's
 right
 to
 protest
 as
 long
 as


it
 is
 lawful
 and
 as
 long
 as
 it's
 safe


what
 happened
 specifically
 with
 green


peace
 this
 is
 not
 a
 new
 lawsuit
 this
 is


something
 that
 happened
 in
 February
 of


2023
 what
 happened
 there
 was
 a
 number
 of


protesters
 illegally
 mounted
 a
 moving


vessel
 a
 72,000
 metric
 ton
 moving
 vessel


the
 judge
 said
 that
 that
 they
 were


putting
 their
 own
 lives
 at
 risk
 and
 they


were
 putting
 our
 crew's
 life
 at
 risk
 I


have
 no
 problem
 with
 anyone
 wanting
 to


uh
 uh
 protest
 whether
 oil
 and
 gas
 should


be
 taking
 place
 in
 the
 North
 Sea
 but
 to


do
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it
 was
 done
 could


potentially
 have
 significantly
 hurt
 our


people
 um
 moving
 on
 to
 geopolitics
 we


touched
 upon
 that
 um
 earlier
 on
 now
 um


what
 impact
 do
 you
 see
 the
 energy


transition
 having
 on
 geopolitics
 just


what
 is
 the
 interplay
 between
 the
 two


now
 it's
 a
 heavy
 interplay
 um
 I
 think
 at


the
 heart
 of
 the
 energy
 transition
 will


be
 the
 difference
 between
 are
 we
 going


to
 be
 a
 much
 more
 globalized
 world
 or


are
 we
 going
 to
 become
 a
 much
 more


localized
 protective
 uh
 protectionist


World
 those
 will
 those
 will
 play
 up
 um


whether
 the
 energy
 corridors
 the
 trade


corridors
 of
 energy
 flows
 start
 to
 move


towards
 Allied
 parties
 um
 away
 from
 what


is
 a
 free
 flow
 of
 energy
 um
 of
 course


disruptions
 that
 we
 see
 today
 for


example
 in
 the
 Red
 Sea
 and
 and
 Beyond


are
 having
 their
 own
 impact
 on
 on
 energy


flows
 so
 so
 I
 think
 the
 two
 are


significantly


interlined
 moving
 towards
 um
 a
 split


world
 where
 you
 have
 China
 Iran
 Russia


on
 the
 one
 side
 and
 west
 on
 the
 other
 is


just
 going
 to
 be
 more
 deeply
 embedded
 in


in
 the
 world
 I
 think
 there's
 definitely


an
 element
 of
 um
 what
 we
 would
 call
 um


polarization
 in
 the
 overall
 geopolitical


space
 and
 what
 what
 are
 the
 consequences


of
 that
 what
 is
 it
 what
 will
 it
 lead
 to


like
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 it's
 going
 to
 lead
 to


a
 uh
 slower
 energy
 transition
 than
 would


have
 been
 desired
 um
 the
 biggest
 I'm


sorry
 why
 well
 the
 biggest
 enabler
 of


the
 energy
 transition
 today
 has
 been
 the


very
 lowcost
 Chinese
 products
 that
 are


coming
 into
 the
 market
 you
 look
 at
 the


majority
 of
 where
 the
 energy
 transition


is
 happening
 over
 50%
 of
 EVS
 were
 sold


in
 China
 last
 year
 over
 50%
 of
 renewable


generation
 was
 deployed
 in
 China
 and


that's
 because
 you
 have
 less
 than


$10,000


EVs
 and
 you're
 ability
 to
 be
 able
 to


Source
 cheap
 solar
 panels
 is
 in
 China
 As


you
 move
 towards
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


affordability
 constraints
 start
 to
 kick


in
 and
 therefore
 as
 we
 see
 more
 and
 more


protectionist
 measures
 that's
 going
 to


have
 an
 impact
 it
 will
 mean
 of
 course


more
 local
 production
 but
 it's
 going
 to


be
 local
 production
 at
 higher
 cost
 that


will
 be
 more
 difficult
 to
 compete


against
 lower
 cost
 energy
 sources
 like


oil
 and
 gas
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think


there's
 a
 risk
 of
 the
 geopolitical


polarization
 going
 down
 the
 energy


transition
 it
 will
 also
 mean
 more
 more


and
 more
 disruption
 in
 in
 the
 way
 energy


flows
 and
 critically
 as
 we
 look
 at
 a


larger
 role
 for
 Renewables
 in
 the
 energy


sector


intermittency
 is
 inevitable
 and


therefore
 the
 volatility
 in
 the
 energy


sector
 will
 only
 increase
 and
 volatility


we
 have
 seen
 just
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years


after
 the
 the
 Russian
 invasion
 of


Ukraine
 how
 that
 volatility
 plays
 and


impacts
 everything
 from
 cost
 of
 living


through
 to
 voting
 patterns
 and
 Beyond


and
 that
 is
 a
 concern
 as
 we
 look
 into


the
 future
 moving
 on
 to
 Cora
 culture
 so


um
 shell
 is
 basically
 a
 merger
 of
 two


companies
 shell
 which
 was
 an
 English


company
 and
 Royal
 Dutch
 uh
 this
 is
 all


the
 way
 back
 to
 1907
 so
 it's
 been
 a


little
 while
 and
 then
 you
 moved
 your


head
 your
 headquarter
 to
 to
 London
 where


you
 now
 live
 but
 there
 were
 also
 talks


about
 you
 potentially
 moving
 it
 to


America
 I
 guess
 at
 the
 time
 um
 when
 you


moved
 just
 what
 kind
 of
 Cora
 culture
 do


you
 have
 now
 at
 Shell
 how
 would
 you


define
 it
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 difficult


to
 define
 a
 culture
 um
 other
 than
 to


take
 it
 back
 to
 the
 core
 values
 that
 the


culture
 espouses
 and
 and
 and
 our
 our


values
 have
 been
 clear
 for
 a
 long
 long


time
 now
 it's
 all
 about
 honesty


integrity
 and
 respect
 for
 for
 people
 but


your
 question
 of
 course
 indeed
 reflects


all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 when
 we
 brought
 the


two
 parts
 of
 shell
 together
 and
 of


course
 there's
 been
 an
 evolution
 of
 that


culture
 but
 we
 still
 have
 that
 uh
 Anglo


Dutch
 core
 that
 we
 have
 always
 had
 and


always
 enjoyed
 as
 a
 company
 our
 English


and
 Dutch
 presence
 of
 course
 shapes
 our


history
 we
 had
 some
 real
 challenges
 for


example
 2004
 our
 reserves
 crisis
 and
 how


that
 shaped
 the
 company
 thereafter
 under


the
 leadership
 of
 yurun
 vanir
 at
 the


time
 all
 of
 those
 actually
 I
 think


create
 the
 culture
 of
 of
 today
 shell


today
 I
 think
 is
 seen
 by
 many
 as
 being
 a


heavily
 a
 Technology
 based
 company


Innovation
 based
 company
 um
 we
 can


sometimes
 be
 seen
 as
 complex


bureaucratic
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key


elements
 we're
 looking
 to
 unwind
 to


simplify
 the
 company
 all
 of
 that
 I
 think


creates
 unique
 Elements
 which
 we
 have
 to


start
 there
 as
 we
 think
 about
 where
 we


want
 to
 go
 into
 the
 future
 where
 do
 you


want
 to
 go
 what
 part
 of
 the
 CER
 culture


would
 you
 like
 to
 change
 look
 I
 think


it's
 about
 evolving
 that
 culture
 because


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 that
 I'd
 like
 to
 to


keep
 held
 together
 the
 the
 the


camaraderie
 the
 incredible
 sort
 of
 safe


place
 that
 we
 have
 created
 in
 the


company
 while
 making
 sure
 that


we
 are
 able
 to
 bring
 those
 elements
 of


performance
 discipline
 simplification
 um


when
 I
 when
 I
 came
 out
 of
 or
 when
 I


started
 my
 University
 my
 MBA
 um
 in
 2001


I
 remember
 one
 statement
 that
 was
 said


to
 me
 on
 day
 one
 this
 was
 a
 har
 by
 it


was
 in
 in
 Harvard
 Business
 School
 by
 the


dean
 he
 said
 the
 best
 leaders
 are


tough-minded
 but
 kind-hearted


tough-minded
 but
 kind-hearted


I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 kind-hearted
 culture


already
 now
 we
 need
 to
 be
 tough-minded


about
 the
 choices
 we
 make
 as
 a
 company


to
 really
 focus
 on
 the
 things
 that
 that


matter
 in
 the
 areas
 where
 we
 can
 create


the
 most
 impact
 both
 on
 a
 value
 more


value
 perspective
 as
 well
 as
 a
 less


emissions
 perspective
 that's
 I
 think
 our


scope
 for
 improvement
 how
 do
 you
 go


about
 changing
 it
 I
 think
 by
 being
 clear


are
 you
 a
 very
 empathetic
 person
 I
 can
 I


can
 be
 incredibly
 empathetic
 but
 I
 can


also
 realize
 that
 I
 can
 lock
 in
 in


certain
 areas
 that's
 the
 danger
 of
 being


in
 the
 in
 the
 Ivory
 Tower
 and
 so
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 reprieves
 for
 me
 is
 getting


out
 there
 I
 find
 I
 take
 the
 most
 energy


and
 I
 feel
 the
 most
 connected
 when
 I'm


on
 the
 road
 visiting
 our
 teams
 it


fundamentally
 changes
 my
 mood
 because


it's
 so
 so
 easy
 to
 get
 stuck
 in
 meetings


meetings
 meetings
 and
 um
 great


theoretical
 discussions
 fundamentally


different
 when
 you're
 on
 the
 front
 line


offshore
 talking
 to
 folks
 there


connecting
 listening
 to
 what
 the


challenges
 are
 and
 where
 the


opportunities
 are
 and
 so
 I
 find
 that


that's
 the
 biggest
 energy
 and
 therefore


now
 I've
 integrated
 it
 not
 just
 in
 terms


of
 visits
 but
 every
 month
 I
 find
 time
 to


be
 able
 to
 reconnect
 with
 people
 across


the
 organization
 where
 my
 team
 will
 look


at
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the
 brilliant


stories
 happening
 in
 the
 organization


where
 I
 can
 just
 pick
 up
 the
 phone
 and


call
 someone
 and
 say
 tell
 me
 a
 bit
 more


about
 this
 or
 thank
 you
 for
 doing
 what


you're
 doing
 those
 areas
 for
 me
 are
 are


incredibly
 important
 and
 that's
 what


creates
 the
 the
 DNA
 of
 this
 company
 M


now
 um
 energy
 companies
 are
 very
 safety


conscious
 and
 you
 have
 to
 be
 right
 but


you
 have
 to
 be
 it
 you
 know
 at
 the


drilling
 platforms
 but
 it
 often
 kind
 of


uh
 uh
 takes
 over
 the
 whole
 corpor


cultureal
 the
 whole
 group
 right
 so
 at


the
 HQ
 in
 some
 places
 you
 have
 to
 hold


the
 handrail
 when
 you
 go
 up
 the
 stairs


because
 it's
 less
 risky
 right
 uh
 you


come
 into
 the
 parking
 lot
 and
 you're


supposed
 to
 park
 with
 your
 with
 your


back
 to
 the
 wall
 because
 you
 are
 less


tired
 uh
 in
 the
 morning
 uh
 so
 it's
 some


less
 risky
 to
 park
 this
 way
 right
 so
 all


this
 kind
 of
 stuff
 is
 just
 like
 really


um
 uh
 Perman
 ating
 the
 whole
 corpor


culture
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 make
 sure


that
 a
 big
 company
 like
 shell
 continues


to
 be
 Innovative
 and
 agile
 we're
 still


learning
 how
 to
 do
 it
 if
 I'm
 honest
 with


you
 um
 we
 are
 by
 the
 way
 one
 of
 the


companies
 that
 are
 required
 to
 hold
 the


handrail
 with
 the
 the
 key
 element
 of


that
 ethos
 being
 do
 you
 hold
 the


handrail
 when
 I
 hold
 the
 handrail
 and
 my


kids
 hold
 the
 handrail
 as
 well
 now
 and


why
 why
 is
 that
 it's
 you
 you
 learn
 very


quickly
 that
 you
 can't
 ask
 the
 front


line
 to
 do
 things
 that
 you
 are
 not


willing
 to
 do


and
 so
 if
 you're
 asking
 folks
 who
 should


you
 be
 holding
 the
 handrail
 in
 the


headquarter
 look
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 the
 handrail
 is
 a
 proxy
 for


something
 else
 the
 handrail
 holding
 the


handrail
 is
 a
 proxy
 for
 how
 we
 are


united
 around
 our
 commitment
 to
 safety


but
 your
 question
 still
 holds
 sometimes


we
 do
 things
 which
 are
 in
 the
 context
 of


the
 risk
 profile
 there
 are
 limited
 you


don't
 need
 to
 do
 that
 thing
 right
 um
 and


the
 handrail
 has
 become
 more
 symbolic


but
 if
 you
 have
 a
 symbolic
 elements
 you


create
 an
 incredibly
 complex


organization
 with
 everyone
 going
 to
 the


lowest
 common
 denominator
 and
 so
 what


are
 we
 trying
 to
 do
 around
 it
 we've


recognized
 that
 we
 need
 to
 have


different
 control
 Frameworks
 for


different
 parts
 of
 the
 company
 we
 have


typically
 had
 one
 shell
 control


framework
 we
 are
 now
 adopting
 what
 we


call
 Shell
 performance
 framework
 that
 is


very
 unique
 to
 the
 business
 if
 you
 are


in
 Mobility
 if
 you
 are
 selling
 fuel


that's
 a
 different
 risk
 profile
 to
 if


you
 are
 Drilling
 in
 deep
 water
 that's
 a


different
 risk
 profile
 to
 if
 you
 are


actually
 selling
 lubricants
 and
 so
 what


we
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 to
 build


Frameworks
 risk
 Frameworks
 that
 are


specific
 to
 the
 risk
 profile
 that's


there
 understanding
 what
 your
 key
 risks


are
 and
 then
 liberating
 the
 organization


and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


things
 I
 take
 pride
 in
 over
 the
 last


couple
 years
 we
 used
 to
 have
 in
 our


safety
 environment
 and
 asset
 management


set
 of
 Standards
 we
 have
 around
 1,700


standards
 that's
 what
 we
 had
 we
 have


challenged


ourselves
 and
 brought
 in
 the
 experts
 to


say
 you
 have
 to
 go
 in
 and
 really
 reduce


that
 to
 make
 it
 sharp
 and
 efficient


we've
 reduced
 that
 by
 70%


mhm
 that
 will
 then
 allow
 people
 to
 say


what
 are
 the
 mus
 haves
 and
 then
 here's
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 nice
 to
 haves
 but
 you


need
 to
 decide
 whether
 you
 are
 willing


to
 take
 that
 on
 now
 that's
 easier
 said


than
 done
 because
 what
 we
 still
 find
 is


even
 when
 we
 say
 that
 people
 still
 def


to
 the
 old
 culture
 of
 well
 let's
 just


keep
 them
 just
 in
 case
 and
 so
 this
 is


also
 about
 building
 confidence
 in
 the


organization
 courage
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take


on
 one's
 own
 risk
 and
 to
 be
 able
 to


manage
 one's
 risk
 this
 is
 about
 really


becoming
 accountable
 and
 allowing
 our


people
 to
 become
 empowered
 that
 doesn't


happen
 in
 six
 months
 it
 doesn't
 happen


in
 two
 years
 this
 is
 a
 journey
 of


multiple
 years
 which
 we
 are
 on
 but
 when


you
 have
 a
 bureaucratic
 um
 a


bureaucratic
 organization
 like
 that
 with


so
 many
 rules
 do
 you
 do
 you
 manage
 to


attract
 the
 right
 type
 of
 people
 people


do
 the
 right
 type
 of
 people
 would
 want


to
 work
 in
 in
 an
 organization
 like
 that


we
 we
 are
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 have
 been


blessed
 with
 is
 we
 have
 outstanding


people
 and
 we
 continue
 to
 attract


outstanding
 how
 do
 you
 get
 them
 how
 do


you
 get
 them
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 few


things
 one
 is
 the
 shell
 brand
 is
 very


very
 strong
 right
 um
 I
 know
 it
 when
 I


joined
 shell
 there
 is
 something
 about


the
 shell
 brand
 that
 captivates
 the


imagination
 we
 are
 we
 are
 the
 number
 one


brand
 um
 in
 the
 energy
 sector
 um
 I
 think


beyond
 that
 our
 ability
 to
 be
 able
 to


offer


careers
 that
 span
 the
 entire
 Energy


System
 whether
 you
 are
 in
 gas
 or
 oil
 or


tomorrow
 you're
 selling
 fuel
 retailing


or
 working
 in
 lubricants
 or
 in
 chemicals


or
 in
 research
 and
 Technology
 all
 of
 it


is
 available
 well
 so
 now
 while
 I
 have


applied
 for
 a
 job
 in
 Shell
 I'm
 now
 in


the
 final
 interview
 uh
 I'm
 uh
 really
 uh


very
 fortunate
 because
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


interviewed
 by
 the
 big
 cheese
 and
 here


you
 are
 what
 do
 you
 ask
 me
 to
 see


whether
 I'm
 fit
 for
 Shell
 I
 think
 the


number
 one
 thing
 is
 make
 sure
 that
 this


is
 the
 right
 company
 for
 you
 are
 you
 are


you
 committed
 to
 a
 future
 to
 be
 able
 to


transform
 the
 energy
 system
 as
 this


company
 is
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 that's
 one
 do


your
 values
 fit
 with
 the
 company
 your


ability
 everything
 you've
 learned
 is


interesting
 for
 us
 we
 will
 form
 all
 the


technical
 capabilities
 that
 are
 required


to
 help
 you
 we
 will
 give
 you
 the


commercial
 capabilities
 that's
 not
 what


we're
 worried
 about
 it's
 culture
 fit
 and


it's
 ability
 to
 be
 able
 to
 actually


influence
 the
 direction
 of
 where
 this


company
 goes
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 we
 fit


you
 as
 much
 as
 you
 fit
 us
 now
 you
 um


make
 people
 change
 jobs
 with
 frequent


intervals
 is
 it
 every
 four
 years
 people


are
 supposed
 to
 try
 out
 a
 new
 job
 and


there's
 no
 set
 measure
 but
 four
 years
 is


not
 atypical
 right
 so
 some
 people
 will


do
 their
 job
 for
 eight
 years
 N9
 years
 10


years
 we
 just
 announced
 for
 example
 our


head
 of
 Mobility
 is
 moving
 on
 having


done
 that
 job
 for
 10
 years
 it
 really


depends
 but
 four
 is
 is
 not
 atypical
 for


a
 rotation
 so
 which
 I
 think
 is
 is
 really


impressive
 just
 what
 do
 you
 achieve
 by


that
 look
 there's
 pros
 and
 cons
 to
 it


and
 that's
 why
 it's
 important
 to
 be
 very


specific
 the
 beauty
 of
 of
 um
 moving


people
 out
 every
 four
 years
 is
 you


create
 opportunities
 to
 really
 learn
 and


to
 grow
 and
 to
 experience
 different


parts
 of
 the
 company
 and
 because
 we
 are


a
 multi-energy
 company
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 benefits
 is
 allowing
 people
 to


understand
 the
 different
 parts
 of
 the


shell
 Forest
 so
 that
 they
 can
 actually


connect
 those
 parts
 together
 as
 they


become
 more
 senior
 in
 the
 company
 I


think
 it
 creates
 excitement
 for
 young


staff
 um
 our
 retention
 rates
 are
 are
 are


amongst
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 industry
 uh


and
 so
 we
 know
 we're
 able
 to
 keep
 staff


because
 they
 get
 motivated
 but
 for


certain
 jobs
 you
 need
 tenure
 uh


particular
 jobs
 that
 are
 uh
 connected


let's
 say
 to
 external
 stakeholders
 where


you
 need
 to
 be
 in
 the
 country
 and
 be


known
 to
 the
 stakeholders
 certain
 jobs


where
 corporate
 history
 is
 important


such
 as
 for
 example
 in
 in
 research
 and


development
 so
 there's
 there's
 different


parts
 which
 we
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 to


also
 manage
 moving
 on
 to
 leadership
 what


is
 good
 leadership
 to
 you
 um
 I
 I
 I
 think


it's
 it
 starts


with
 having
 the
 appetite
 and
 the


humility
 to
 learn
 because
 I
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 biggest
 dangers
 in
 this
 job
 as


you
 get
 become
 more
 and
 more
 senior
 uh


in
 most
 jobs
 actually
 is
 the
 conviction


that
 you
 start
 to
 actually
 know
 stuff
 um


that
 is
 that
 is
 a
 dangerous
 space
 to
 be


the
 world
 around
 us
 is
 moving
 at
 an


incredibly
 Fast
 Pace
 um
 now
 change
 is


hard
 but
 it's
 also
 inevitable
 and


therefore
 leaders
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


reflect
 that
 change
 both
 internally
 and


externally
 and
 so
 to
 me
 the
 appetite
 to


learn
 and
 the
 awareness
 to
 be
 able
 to


then
 influence
 that
 ecosystem
 around


which
 you
 are
 learning
 on
 a
 regular


basis
 is
 a
 critical
 element
 of


leadership
 I
 think
 another
 element
 is
 um


I
 I
 recognized
 a
 few
 months
 into
 my
 job


that
 you
 have
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


um
 assumptions
 which
 underly
 every
 view


we
 have
 right
 I
 have
 26
 years
 in
 Shell


uh
 that
 I've
 learn
 multiple
 things
 and


that
 that
 forms
 my
 own
 thinking
 uh
 on


the
 energy
 system
 and
 on
 what
 are
 the


likely
 Technologies
 to
 evolve
 tomorrow


or
 what
 will
 what
 will
 be
 unlikely
 to


evolve
 one
 has
 to
 be
 careful
 that
 those


assumptions
 do
 not
 lock
 one's
 head
 in


and
 you
 become
 almost
 combative
 in


saying
 no
 no
 my
 truth
 is
 the
 only
 truth


that's
 one
 of
 the
 issues
 I
 see
 today
 in


many
 of
 the
 discussions
 I
 have
 it's


either
 my
 truth
 or
 your
 truth
 if
 you


could
 implant
 a
 new
 skill
 set
 into
 your


brain
 what
 would
 it
 be
 I'd
 love
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 understanding
 of


um
 Fusion
 nuclear
 and
 where
 that
 is


going
 u
 i
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


background
 in
 that
 space
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 it


is
 curiosity
 and
 and
 and
 I'm
 learning
 uh


AI
 is
 another
 one
 that
 I've
 been


spending
 quite
 some
 time
 on
 just
 you


know
 reading
 books
 I
 just
 read
 the


Mustafa
 Sal's
 the
 coming
 the
 coming
 wave


it's
 intriguing
 because


it's
 we're
 at
 the
 cusp
 of
 something


that's
 going
 to
 fundamentally
 change
 not


just
 the
 Energy
 System
 the
 entire
 world


so
 I'd
 love
 to
 learn
 much
 faster
 than


I'm
 currently


learning
 don't
 we
 all
 now
 these
 are
 very


big
 topics
 now
 how
 do
 you
 get
 this
 sense


of
 purpose
 uh
 into
 your


employees
 because
 intrinsic
 motivation


is
 the
 most
 important
 driver
 for


satisfaction
 and
 happiness
 and
 so
 on
 and


um
 how
 do
 you
 install
 that
 into
 the


company
 there's
 two
 elements
 I
 think
 one


is
 making
 sure
 that
 the
 purpose
 of
 the


company
 is
 Broad


enough
 and
 Noble
 enough
 that
 people
 can


connect
 to
 it
 but
 then
 secondly


recognizing
 that
 each
 of
 us
 will
 have
 a


different
 purpose
 biggest
 thing
 we
 can


do
 is
 to
 have
 great
 team
 leaders
 because


team
 leaders
 actually
 help
 our
 employees


connect
 both
 to
 the
 company
 purpose
 but


even
 more
 importantly
 help
 individuals


find
 their
 own
 purpose
 I've
 had
 leaders


who
 have
 helped
 me
 with
 that
 to
 say


actually
 here's
 where
 the
 company
 wants


to
 go
 but
 put
 that
 aside
 for
 a
 minute


what
 do
 you
 want
 to
 do
 what
 is
 driving


you
 is
 it
 is
 it
 your
 kids
 and
 what
 is
 it


about
 what
 your
 kids
 are
 driving
 you


towards
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 want
 to


prove
 to
 them
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 want


to
 prove
 to
 yourself
 and
 so
 we
 spend
 a


lot
 of
 time
 building
 that
 cadra
 of
 team


leadership
 and
 that's
 the
 number
 one


metric
 that
 we
 we
 look
 for
 every
 single


year
 when
 we
 do
 our
 overall
 shell
 people


survey
 results
 it's
 how
 is
 the
 quality


of
 our
 team
 leadership
 and
 where
 are


interventions
 required
 to
 help
 those


team
 leaders
 be
 better
 how
 do
 you
 react


when
 people
 make


mistakes
 I
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 embrace


the
 learning
 around
 mistakes
 right
 I


have
 to
 say
 I
 react
 much
 better
 at
 work


because
 I'm
 conditioned
 to
 than
 at
 home


when
 my
 son
 does
 something
 wrong
 I'm


like
 come
 on
 we've
 talked
 about
 this


before
 but
 I
 know
 that's
 wrong
 but
 is


there
 not
 like
 a
 bit
 of
 temper
 in
 your


your
 lebanes
 background
 isn't
 that
 quite


a
 I
 get
 the
 actually
 headed
 type
 of


actually
 it's
 the
 opposite
 when
 when


you've
 when
 you've
 gone
 through
 a
 lot


right
 so
 I've
 I've
 I've
 been
 I've
 had
 to


sort
 of
 evacuate
 my
 wife
 and
 my
 son
 from


you
 know
 reigning
 bombs
 when
 in
 2006
 uh


we
 were
 Refugee
 in
 1982
 when
 we
 had
 to


go
 through
 the
 Syrian
 border
 when
 you've


had
 those


experiences
 and
 somebody
 upsets
 you
 with


a
 financial
 issue
 or
 the
 like
 life
 is


there
 much
 bigger
 things
 than
 being


worried
 about
 a
 mistake
 or
 the
 like
 you


thank
 God
 every
 day
 for
 what
 you
 have


and
 then
 you
 sort
 of
 say
 okay
 what
 can


we
 do
 and
 that's
 what
 I
 like
 about
 our


company
 by
 and
 large
 when
 something
 goes


wrong
 everyone
 comes
 together
 to
 be
 able


to
 actually
 solve
 the
 issue
 and
 that
 to


me
 is
 a
 big
 re
 reason
 why
 I
 stayed
 in


the
 company
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 a
 company
 I


joined
 with
 the
 idea
 and
 want
 to
 get
 it


on
 my
 CV
 learn
 a
 bit
 and
 leave
 within
 a


year
 and
 26
 years
 27
 years
 later
 I'm


still
 around
 how
 do
 you
 relax
 uh
 I
 love


sports
 uh
 I'm
 an
 avid
 Sportsman
 I
 have


three
 young
 boys
 uh
 so
 I'm
 having
 to


work
 harder
 to
 be
 able
 to
 continue
 to


compete
 with
 them
 as
 they
 grow
 older


what
 kind
 do
 you
 what
 kind
 of
 things
 do


you
 do
 play
 football
 uh
 soccer
 um
 I
 grew


up
 loving
 soccer
 playing
 it
 we
 do
 tennis


uh
 we
 are
 more
 and
 more
 now
 into
 paddle


we
 do
 water
 sports
 um
 basketball


whatever
 we
 can
 do
 any
 sport
 where
 we


can
 get
 the
 competitive
 juices
 at


amongst
 the
 four
 boys
 we're
 doing
 it
 do


you
 have
 time
 to
 read
 I
 do
 have
 time
 to


read
 um
 I
 do
 my
 daily
 reading
 I
 do
 my


weekly
 reading
 so
 you
 know
 um


Publications
 and
 the
 like
 and
 then
 I'll


do
 my
 sort
 of
 books
 typically
 when
 I'm


traveling
 I
 I
 go
 back
 to
 my
 favorite


Khan's
 the
 prophet
 which
 whenever
 I'm


going
 through
 a
 phase
 where
 I
 just
 why


is
 that
 your
 um
 your
 favorite
 book
 um


it's
 nice
 that
 he
 comes
 from
 a
 village


that's
 not
 too
 too
 far
 away
 from
 where


my
 mother
 uh
 grew
 up
 in
 Lebanon


um
 but
 more
 specifically
 that
 book
 to
 me


was
 one
 where
 it
 allowed
 me
 to
 sort
 of


move
 away
 from
 self
 to
 actually
 society


and
 my
 broader
 role
 within
 shaping


Society
 um
 particularly
 when
 he
 I'm


reflected
 for
 example
 now
 around
 my
 own


kids
 where
 he
 uh
 in
 his
 book
 he
 talks


about
 um
 your
 kids
 are
 not
 your
 kids


they
 come
 through
 you
 and
 that
 that
 very


powerful
 as
 my
 son
 starts
 to
 prepare
 to


go
 to
 university
 how
 do
 you
 let
 him
 go


now
 you've
 done
 what
 you
 can
 he's
 his


own
 man
 now
 and
 you
 try
 to
 support
 him


through
 that
 Journey
 so
 in
 those
 times


of
 of
 reflection
 I
 think
 that
 book
 moves


me
 from
 what
 is
 Hardcore
 numbers


engineering
 back
 to
 philosophy
 and
 life


which
 is
 which
 is
 not
 a
 bad
 idea
 and


well
 um
 what
 is
 your
 best
 advice
 to
 your


three
 sons
 and
 all
 the
 young
 people
 who


listen
 to
 this
 podcast
 generally
 my
 my


sons
 are
 I
 think
 sick
 and
 tired
 of


hearing
 me
 say
 this
 it's
 how
 to
 make


them
 the
 best
 version
 of
 themselves


every
 single
 one
 of
 my
 sons
 is
 different


actually
 it's
 shocking
 to
 me
 and
 my
 wife


how
 different
 they
 are
 so
 my
 biggest
 job


is
 how
 do
 I
 help
 each
 one
 of
 them
 be
 the


best
 version
 of
 themselves
 I
 think


what's
 great
 about
 what
 we
 can
 do
 is
 if


you
 can
 have
 people
 who
 are
 truly


special
 at
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that's


absolutely
 fine
 you'll
 be
 you
 have


others
 who
 who
 will
 complement
 their


skills
 but
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 are


special
 at
 a
 few
 things
 and
 my
 biggest


job
 is
 to
 help
 them
 find
 what
 those
 one


or
 two
 things
 for
 each
 of
 the
 is
 well
 it


seems
 like
 you
 are
 a
 very
 good
 version


of
 well
 soan
 so
 big
 thanks
 for
 uh
 for


being
 here
 uh
 really
 impressive
 thank


you
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 niola
 thank
 you


for
 having
 me
