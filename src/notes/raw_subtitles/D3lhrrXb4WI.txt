I'm
 going
 to
 just
 be
 honest.
 There
 were


times
 where
 Joe
 Biden
 greatly


disappointed
 me
 and
 frankly,
 you
 know,


angered
 me.
 Like
 on
 the
 day
 of
 my
 debate


with
 Trump,
 the
 stakes
 were
 so
 high.
 And


the
 president
 calls
 and
 he
 said
 to
 me,


it
 just
 was
 so
 unnecessary.


>> And
 you
 took
 something
 from
 that


>> that
 his
 motivation
 was
 all
 about


himself.


>> Do
 you
 think
 he
 wanted
 you
 to
 win
 the


election?


Madame
 Vice
 President,
 there's
 nothing


you
 said
 I
 couldn't
 ask
 you.


>> Cuz
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 say.
 And
 so
 it


>> Okay.
 So,
 do
 you
 wish
 you
 hadn't
 ran?


>> No.
 But
 I
 do
 regret
 that
 we
 did
 not
 have


more
 time.


>> And
 then
 the
 debate
 that
 came
 before


with
 Biden
 and
 Trump,
 it
 was
 a
 car


crash.


>> I
 mean,
 this
 was
 clearly
 an
 individual


that
 was
 very
 much
 struggling.


>> He
 didn't
 want
 that
 debate.
 I
 could
 tell


something
 was
 a
 little
 off.


>> How
 do
 you
 know?


>> Well,
 I
 could
 start
 with
 this.


>> And
 what
 about
 not
 going
 on
 Joe
 Rogan's


show?
 I
 definitely
 regret
 that
 we
 didn't


do
 it,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 games


being
 played.


>> And
 then
 on
 that
 night
 when
 the
 election


hasn't
 gone
 your
 way,
 what
 would
 I
 have


seen
 if
 I
 was
 a
 fly
 on
 the
 wall
 in
 the


room?


>> I
 was
 in
 a
 state
 of
 shock.
 Like
 I


haven't
 felt
 anything
 similar
 to
 the


emotion
 I
 felt
 that
 day
 other
 than
 the


grief
 I
 felt
 when
 my
 mother
 died
 and
 I


knew
 what
 was
 going
 to
 happen
 to
 our


country.
 So
 I
 had
 a
 hard
 time


reconciling
 that
 we
 can't
 still
 do


something
 about
 it
 because
 I
 grew
 up
 in


an
 environment
 where
 everyone
 was


fighting
 for
 justice
 and
 for
 equality.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 about
 how
 different
 it


could
 have
 been,
 but
 sometimes
 the
 fight


takes
 a
 while.


>> Does
 that
 mean
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 run


again?


>> I


I
 see
 messages
 all
 the
 time
 in
 the


comments
 section
 that
 some
 of
 you
 didn't


realize
 you
 didn't
 subscribe.
 So,
 if
 you


could
 do
 me
 a
 favor
 and
 double
 check
 if


you're
 a
 subscriber
 to
 this
 channel,


that
 would
 be
 tremendously
 appreciated.


It's
 the
 simple,
 it's
 the
 free
 thing


that
 anybody
 that
 watches
 this
 show


frequently
 can
 do
 to
 help
 us
 here
 to


keep
 everything
 going
 in
 this
 show
 in


the
 trajectory
 it's
 on.
 So,
 please
 do


double
 check
 if
 you've
 subscribed
 and
 uh


thank
 you
 so
 much
 because
 in
 a
 strange


way
 you
 are
 you're
 part
 of
 our
 history


and
 you're
 on
 this
 journey
 with
 us
 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 for
 that.
 So,
 yeah,
 thank


you.


>> Madame
 Vice
 President,


how
 are
 you
 doing?


>> I
 am
 well.
 I
 am
 well.
 I
 mean
 all
 things


considered
 I
 am
 well
 my
 family
 is
 good


health
 so
 I
 start
 there
 but
 otherwise


you
 know
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 troubling


time


>> what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 full
 range
 of


emotions
 when
 you
 said
 all
 things


considered
 what
 are
 the
 full
 what's
 the


full
 picture
 there


>> everything
 from


grateful
 and
 feeling
 very
 blessed


to
 extremely
 ly


troubled,
 disappointed,


concerned


of
 the
 state
 of
 our
 country
 and
 by


extension
 the
 world.
 Like
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 watching
 the
 news
 and


reading
 the
 news,
 there's
 a
 state
 of


anxiety
 what
 will
 happen
 next.
 I
 often


have
 found
 myself
 saying
 to
 people,
 it


may
 get
 worse
 before
 it
 gets
 better.
 And


so
 the
 knowledge
 of
 that
 perhaps
 the


anticipation
 of
 that
 I
 think
 keeps
 me


and
 many
 others
 on
 edge.


>> Do
 you
 believe
 that?
 Do
 you
 believe
 it's


it
 could
 get
 worse
 before
 it
 gets


better?


>> I
 think
 it's
 very
 possible.
 Every
 day
 I


I
 because
 actually
 during
 the
 book
 tour


I've
 I've
 said
 it
 to
 audiences
 and
 in


one
 city
 and
 then
 the
 next
 day
 something


happens.


There's
 a
 lot
 that's
 very
 unpredictable


about
 this
 administration.
 Although


there
 is
 almost
 all
 of
 it
 that
 I
 did


predict.


Now,
 I
 know
 you
 you
 only
 had
 107
 days


>> to
 potentially
 intervene
 in
 the
 course


of
 history,
 but
 when
 you
 see
 these


things
 playing
 out
 that
 you're
 referring


to
 that
 incite
 those
 feelings
 you
 have


of
 frustration,


>> um
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 anxiety,
 etc.,


>> do
 do
 you
 feel
 a
 sense
 of
 like


responsibility
 in
 a
 weird
 way
 because


because


>> yeah,


>> there
 was
 a
 percentage
 chance
 of
 sort
 of


intervening
 in
 these
 things.
 This
 is
 a


complex
 question
 to
 ask,
 but
 it's


>> Mhm.
 I
 do
 think
 about
 how
 different
 it


could
 have
 been.


>> Mhm.


>> I
 do
 think
 about
 it
 in
 the
 context
 of


the
 number
 of
 people
 who
 are
 being


impacted
 in
 such
 a
 horrible
 way.
 I
 think


of
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 number
 of
 people


who
 are
 existing
 and
 living
 in
 utter


fear
 right
 now,
 afraid
 of
 being
 attacked


or
 afraid
 of
 being
 targeted
 with
 hate.


um
 much
 less
 misinformation.
 I
 Yeah,
 I


do.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 know
 that
 the
 the
 race


that
 I
 ran
 for
 president
 of
 the
 United


States,
 the
 outcome
 of
 that
 election
 is


what
 has
 happened


and
 it
 would
 have
 been
 different.
 It


would
 have
 been
 very
 different.
 I
 try


not
 to
 allow
 myself
 to
 think
 too
 much


this
 way.
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 because
 I


for
 better
 and
 worse
 really


do
 like
 to
 be
 centered
 on
 the
 present.


So,
 so
 let's
 go.
 I
 want
 to
 understand


the
 the
 set
 of
 circumstances
 that


created
 someone
 like
 you
 because
 you're


an
 anomaly.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 firsts
 that


appear
 in
 your
 career,
 but
 if
 we
 if
 we


start
 at
 the
 beginning,
 what
 is
 the


context
 that
 shapes
 someone
 to
 become


such
 an
 anomaly
 in
 their
 professional


career?


>> My
 parents
 and
 the
 community
 that
 raised


me.
 My
 mother
 arrived
 from
 India
 in
 the


United
 States
 at
 the
 age
 of
 19
 by


herself.


My
 mother
 naturally
 at
 that
 young
 age


became
 aligned
 with
 the
 civil
 rights


movement


>> in
 in
 um
 Berkeley
 and
 Oakland,


California.
 Met
 my
 father
 who
 had
 been
 a


national
 scholar
 in
 Jamaica.


They
 fell
 in
 love
 and
 here
 I
 am.
 My


sister
 and
 I
 were
 born
 and
 we
 were
 born


in
 an
 environment
 where
 everyone
 was


fighting
 for
 justice
 and
 for
 freedom
 and


for
 equality.
 every
 message
 we
 got
 was


you
 are
 important
 and
 you
 have
 a
 duty
 to


figure
 out
 how
 you're
 going
 to


participate.
 I
 I
 noticed
 this
 as
 I
 was


reading
 through
 your
 story,
 how
 service


and
 helping
 others
 seems
 to
 be
 so


interwoven
 into
 your
 DNA.


>> And
 even
 we
 spoke
 to
 Doug


>> Uhhuh.


>> your
 husband
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 me
 a


story
 about
 your
 first
 date
 with
 him.


>> Uhhuh.
 What
 did
 he
 tell
 you?
 Well,


apparently
 you
 made
 a
 you
 made
 a
 remark


on
 that
 first
 date
 that
 you're
 you're


here
 to
 help
 people
 and
 to
 serve
 people.


He
 told
 me
 many
 things.
 We
 we
 have
 a
 I


have
 many
 pages
 of
 what
 Duck
 said.
 Very


fascinating.
 He's
 um
 he's
 very
 in
 love


with
 you,
 by
 the
 way.


>> I'm
 very
 in
 love
 with
 my
 husband
 and


he's
 very
 funny.
 I
 hope
 you
 got
 a
 sense


of


>> He
 was
 hilarious
 guy.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 he
 he
 and
 I
 had
 such


different
 careers,
 both
 of
 us
 being


lawyers,
 right?
 He
 went
 immediately
 into


private
 practice.
 I
 never
 wanted
 to
 be


in
 private
 practice.
 It
 was
 never
 about


money
 for
 me.
 was
 always
 about
 people


and
 how


could
 I
 do
 the
 work
 that
 was
 about


protecting
 people
 and
 giving
 people


dignity.


>> Why
 protecting
 people?


>> I
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 um
 that
 has
 to


do
 also
 maybe
 with
 birth
 order.


>> I'm
 the
 eldest.


>> And
 from
 the
 age
 of
 2
 years
 old,
 my


mother
 told
 me,
 "Take
 care
 of
 your


sister.
 Look
 out
 for
 your
 sister."


You've
 got
 all
 kinds
 of
 pictures.
 Canon,


I've
 been
 through
 everything.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 my
 sister
 Maya.


>> That's
 you
 protecting
 her.


>> And
 that's
 me
 protecting
 her.
 I
 grew
 up


also,
 you
 know,
 seeing
 my
 mother
 who
 was


a
 5-ft
 tall
 brown
 woman
 with
 an
 accent


would
 be
 treated.
 She
 taught
 me
 this,
 my


extended
 family
 taught
 me.
 But
 then
 I


also
 witnessed


the
 importance
 of


making
 sure
 that
 all
 people
 that
 their


dignity
 is
 respected
 and
 protected.
 and


I
 because
 I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 have
 lived
 a


life
 to
 see
 where
 that
 doesn't
 always


happen.


>> So
 you
 decide
 to
 focus
 on
 law
 in
 public


practice.
 Um
 you
 have
 a
 phenomenal


career
 from
 that
 point
 onwards.
 It's


really
 remarkable
 what
 you're
 able
 to


accomplish
 and
 this
 is
 I
 guess
 where
 a


lot
 of
 the
 firsts
 come
 in
 because
 from


the
 age
 of
 24
 to
 51
 you
 rise
 from
 deputy


district
 attorney
 to
 California's


attorney
 general
 becoming
 the
 first


woman
 and
 first
 black
 person
 to
 hold


both
 roles.
 Um,
 and
 you
 led
 major


reforms
 in
 that
 time,
 including
 securing


$25
 billion
 in
 homeowner
 relief
 after


the
 2008
 crisis,
 launching
 the
 back
 on


track
 LA
 rehabilitation
 program,
 and


making
 California
 the
 state
 the
 first


state
 to
 mandate
 body
 cameras
 for


justice
 justice
 agents
 and
 much
 more.


An
 incredible
 career
 up
 until
 that


point.
 That
 could
 have
 been
 it.
 You


could
 have
 bowed
 out
 at
 that
 point
 and


celebrated.


>> There's
 so
 much
 more
 to
 be
 done.
 There's


so
 much
 more
 to
 be
 done.
 Um,
 I
 think
 one


of
 my
 strengths
 and
 weaknesses
 is
 um,
 I


like
 to
 solve
 problems,
 but
 that
 means


that
 I
 tend
 to


once
 a
 problem
 has
 been
 addressed,
 move


on
 to
 the
 next
 one
 without
 maybe
 taking


the
 time
 to
 pat
 myself
 on
 the
 back


>> because
 now
 it's
 time
 to
 move
 on
 to
 the


next
 issue.


>> During
 your
 career,
 you
 you
 saw
 some


horrific
 things.
 That's
 the
 nature
 of


your
 job.
 You
 deal
 with
 the
 dark
 darkest


parts
 of
 reality.


>> Parts
 of
 human
 behavior
 and
 nature
 I've


seen.
 Yeah,
 you're
 right.


>> Give
 me
 give
 me
 some
 context
 there.
 What


does
 that
 mean
 in
 reality?


>> Well,
 for
 a
 while
 I
 specialized
 in
 child


sexual
 assault,
 which
 is
 about
 um


the
 most
 horrendous
 of


abuse
 and
 crime,
 which
 is
 an
 adult


abusing
 a
 child.


And


those
 cases
 were
 so
 difficult
 um
 for
 so


many
 reasons.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 couple


that
 I
 remember
 in
 particular
 where
 I


just


where
 the
 children
 were
 so
 young
 that


they
 were
 um
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to


testify.


One
 was
 an
 elementary
 school
 little


girl.
 And
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 remember
 going


into
 the
 bathroom
 of
 the
 courthouse
 and


crying


because
 I
 knew
 a
 jury


would
 not


have
 enough
 to
 convict


and
 um


you
 know,
 broke
 my
 heart.
 I
 mean,
 and
 I


I
 have
 thought
 about
 that
 little
 girl,


you
 know,
 not
 years
 and
 years
 and
 years


later.
 But
 those
 cases,
 you
 know,
 it's


the
 worst
 of
 human
 behavior,
 which
 is
 we


as
 a
 society
 should
 be
 in
 the
 business


of
 protecting
 children
 and
 protecting


their
 vulnerability
 so
 that
 they
 can


thrive.
 Um,
 but
 I've,
 you
 know,
 I've


prosecuted
 homicide
 cases.
 I've,
 um,
 you


know,
 I've
 prosecuted
 fraud
 cases.
 How


does
 how
 does
 one
 deal
 with
 all
 of
 this


stress
 and
 responsibility?
 And
 I'm
 not


just
 referring
 to
 your
 time
 as
 attorney


general,
 but
 even
 thereafter
 with


>> running
 for
 president
 and
 the
 ups
 and


downs
 of
 that,
 the
 public
 feedback,
 the


the
 pressure,
 the
 responsibility
 of


potentially
 running
 the,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 free
 world
 basically
 and
 becoming


the
 most
 powerful
 person
 on
 earth
 and


the
 ups,
 the
 downs,
 the
 attacks,
 the


>> the
 the
 child
 abuses.
 How
 does
 one


learn?
 Is
 there
 a
 framework
 you've


built?
 Is
 there
 are
 there
 ideas
 or


principles
 that
 you've
 developed
 to
 deal


with
 such
 pressure?


>> Well,
 this
 may
 sound
 trit,
 but
 I
 work


out
 every
 day.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 work
 out
 every
 morning,
 no
 matter
 how


little
 sleep
 I've
 had.
 Um,
 I
 just
 find


it
 to
 be
 just
 mind,
 body,
 and
 soul.


>> Have
 you
 changed
 over
 time?


>> Oh,
 for
 sure
 I've
 changed
 over
 time.
 The


pressure
 has
 changed
 in
 magnitude.


>> Um
 but
 the
 pressure
 that
 I
 feel
 in
 terms


of
 my
 sense
 of
 personal
 responsibility


>> has
 not
 changed.
 I
 I
 put
 a
 lot
 of


I
 I
 I
 hold
 myself
 to
 a
 very
 high


standard
 and
 um
 I
 tend
 to
 be
 a


perfectionist
 even
 though
 I
 am
 far
 from


perfect
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 even
 during
 the


107
 days
 every
 night
 I
 would
 stay
 awake


thinking
 what
 more
 could
 I
 have
 done


with
 that
 one
 day


>> 24year-old
 Kamala
 Harris
 who
 starts
 as


that
 sort
 of
 uh
 becomes
 eventually


becomes
 the
 deputy
 district
 attorney.
 If


I
 sat
 her
 there


>> Uhhuh.


>> and
 you're
 sat
 there
 now
 as
 um
 madame


vice
 president,
 what
 would
 be
 the


notable
 differences
 in
 personality,


mentality,


in
 perspective?


>> Oh,
 that's
 interesting.


Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's


changed,
 but
 she
 was
 fearless.


>> She
 was
 fearless.


>> She
 was
 fearless.
 She
 didn't
 hear
 no,
 it


can't
 be
 done.


and
 whether
 it
 was
 the
 first
 case
 that
 I


had
 and
 I
 was
 a
 young
 prosecutor
 and
 I


was
 going
 through
 the
 files
 and
 it
 was
 a


Friday
 evening
 and
 I
 realized
 that
 the


person
 who
 had
 been
 arrested
 had
 young


children
 at
 home,
 a
 woman
 and
 all
 the


courts
 were
 shutting
 down
 and
 I
 went
 to


the
 courtroom
 and
 I
 asked
 the
 judge,


"Please
 take
 the
 bench
 again.
 She
 has


young
 children.
 She
 can't
 stay
 in
 over


the
 weekend.


And
 the
 clerk
 was
 like,
 "Nope,
 he's
 gone


for
 the
 day.
 He's
 leaving
 for
 the
 day."


And
 I
 would
 not
 leave.
 And
 they
 call
 the


case,
 you
 know,
 but
 not
 hearing
 no.
 I


just
 I
 um
 that
 has
 been
 probably
 a


throughine
 of
 my
 my
 life.
 I
 don't
 rest


easy
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 something
 is
 not


possible.


um
 at
 least
 I
 don't
 rest
 easy
 with
 it


without
 trying


>> to
 show
 that
 it
 is
 possible
 and
 that's


probably
 not
 changed.
 I
 also
 have


started
 to
 sit
 better
 with
 the
 idea
 that


but
 you
 can't
 change
 everyone.


>> Mhm.


>> How
 does
 that
 change
 your
 approach


knowing
 that
 you
 can't
 change
 everybody?


I'm
 better
 able
 to
 assess


a
 situation


to
 figure
 out
 what
 is
 the
 potential


there.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.


>> And
 be
 perhaps
 a
 bit
 more
 realistic


without
 being
 I
 think
 jaded
 about
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 guess
 that's
 wisdom
 and


experiences.


>> Yeah.
 It
 comes
 with
 it
 comes
 with
 I


think
 a
 bit
 of
 experience


>> which
 allows
 you
 to
 be
 more
 efficient


and
 effective.


>> And
 that's
 right.
 Yeah.


>> That's
 exactly
 right.
 That's
 exactly


right
 because
 that
 is
 how
 I
 reconcile
 it


which
 is


>> the
 effort
 is
 better
 placed


>> somewhere
 else.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 at
 what
 point
 in
 this
 in
 this


journey
 did
 you
 realize
 that
 you
 wanted


to
 be
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States?


Like
 was
 was
 there
 a
 a
 lunch
 or
 a
 dinner


you
 had
 with
 Doug?
 When
 does
 that


decision
 get
 made
 in
 your
 career?


>> It
 was
 when
 I
 was
 in
 the
 Senate.


>> Yeah.
 I
 ran
 into
 a
 friend
 who
 came
 up,


Doug
 and
 I
 were
 at
 a
 basically
 a
 a


family
 table
 in
 a
 local
 restaurant


eating
 and
 he
 said
 to
 me,
 "You
 should


run
 for
 president."
 And
 it
 had
 not


occurred
 to
 me
 until
 then.
 It
 had
 not


occurred
 to
 me
 to
 run
 for
 president.
 I


There
 are
 people
 who
 are
 born
 thinking


they're
 going
 to
 be
 president.
 There
 are


people
 who
 look
 who
 look
 in
 the
 mirror


every
 day
 and
 see
 a
 president.
 I
 was
 not


one
 of
 those
 people.
 But
 then
 the


thought


it
 kind
 of
 germinated
 and
 then
 of
 course


being
 vice
 president
 and
 doing
 the
 work


of
 vice
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 I


met
 with
 over
 150
 world
 leaders,


presidents,
 prime
 ministers,
 chancellors


and
 kings.
 I've
 negotiated
 very


important


deals
 and
 and
 and
 issues
 on
 behalf
 of


the
 American
 people.
 Um
 I've
 spent


countless
 hours
 not
 only
 in
 the
 Oval


Office
 but
 the
 situation
 room
 and


traveling
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 so
 in


those
 107
 days,
 I
 was
 fully
 aware
 of
 not


only
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 job,
 but


fully
 aware
 that
 I
 had
 the
 experience


and
 knowledge
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 it


effectively.


>> I
 mean,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 was


actually
 talking
 to
 a
 friend
 of
 mine


downstairs,
 Lucy
 Mangini,
 who
 sat
 out


there,
 and
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 this


idea
 of
 like,
 does
 imposter
 syndrome


ever
 leave
 you?
 And
 I imposter
 syndrome


is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 loaded
 term,


>> but
 you
 kind
 of
 assume
 that
 people
 in


higher
 places
 than
 you
 are
 have
 some


like
 genetic
 or
 mental
 or
 some
 gift.


They
 have
 all
 the
 answers.
 But
 higher


you
 climb
 with
 your
 own
 continued


naivity,
 you
 start
 to
 suspect
 that
 no


one
 really


>> is
 genetically
 gifted
 or
 like
 has
 some


superpower
 that
 you
 don't
 have.


>> Right.
 And
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you've


experienced
 that
 in
 your
 career
 where


the
 higher
 you've
 climbed,
 you've


realized
 that
 actually
 everybody
 up
 here


is
 like
 I'm
 like
 that
 like
 or
 I'm
 at


least
 on
 their
 level.
 Have
 you
 had
 that


experience
 in
 your
 career?


>> Yes,
 I
 have.
 And
 but
 I've
 also
 had
 the


imposttor
 syndrome
 experience
 and
 that


was
 when
 I
 was
 first
 elected
 DA


>> and
 I
 challenged
 then
 in
 the
 incumbent.


Um
 I
 started
 out
 at
 six
 points
 in
 the


polls
 which
 is
 six
 out
 of
 100.


>> Uh
 you
 know
 people
 recently
 asked
 me
 how


about
 polls
 polls.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 if
 I


listened
 to
 polls,
 I
 would
 have
 never


run
 for
 my
 first
 office
 and
 therefore
 we


wouldn't
 be
 having
 this
 interview


probably.
 And
 I
 won.
 And
 it
 was,
 you


know,
 it
 was
 not
 expected
 that
 I
 would,


at least
 when
 I
 jumped
 in
 the
 race.
 And


there
 I
 was
 sitting
 in
 the
 office
 and
 I


thought,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I'm
 I'm
 now
 the


elected
 DA
 of
 a
 major
 city
 in
 the
 United


States."
 In
 hindsight,
 it
 was
 maybe
 it's


we
 call
 it
 imposttor
 syndrome.
 to
 your


point
 maybe
 it
 is
 a
 very
 loaded
 term


because
 I
 think
 there
 is
 nothing
 wrong


with
 having
 um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 there's


a
 lot
 that
 is
 good
 with
 having
 a
 certain


level
 of
 humility


>> and
 in
 particular
 when
 the
 people
 have


vested
 you
 with
 great
 power


>> right
 to
 understand
 it's
 not
 about
 you


right
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 that
 is
 part


and
 parcel
 of
 what
 we
 call
 imposttor


syndrome
 or
 who
 has
 it
 I
 think
 often
 it


is
 because
 they
 understand
 how
 serious


The
 job
 is
 on
 behalf
 of
 others.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 applaud
 a
 bit
 of
 humility,
 honest


humility,
 not
 feain
 humility.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 Cuz
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 people


that
 are,
 you
 know,
 self-deprecating
 for


the
 sake
 of
 the
 shtick
 of
 it
 all.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 yes,
 to
 your
 point,
 the
 higher
 you


go,


>> it
 does.
 It
 does
 because
 the
 more
 you're


exposed
 to
 to
 being
 the
 more
 you're
 in


the
 rooms
 with
 the
 people
 who
 are
 who


otherwise
 feel
 untouchable,


>> the
 more
 you
 understand
 that
 they
 are


not
 untouchable.


>> It's
 a
 polite
 way
 of
 putting
 it,


>> the
 more
 you
 understand
 everyone's
 got
 a


little
 dust
 on
 them.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they're
 not
 not
 everyone's
 shiny.


>> But
 it's
 liberating
 to
 know
 that
 that


that's
 the
 case
 because
 you
 know
 there's


we
 all
 put
 a
 ceiling
 above
 us.
 and
 we


think
 that's
 my
 level
 and
 everyone
 above


that
 has
 some
 gift
 that
 I
 will
 never
 be


able
 to
 attain.
 So
 I
 won't
 even
 strive


to
 break
 that
 ceiling
 because
 you
 know
 I


don't
 deserve
 to
 be
 up
 there.


>> But
 but
 and
 also
 don't
 discount
 the


signals
 that
 that
 many
 people
 are
 sent


that
 you
 don't
 belong
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 especially


when
 I'm
 mentoring
 people
 will
 often
 say


to
 them,
 don't
 ever
 limit
 yourself


based
 on
 other
 people's
 limited
 ability


to
 see
 who
 you
 are.


>> Mhm.


>> That's
 their
 limitations
 to
 see
 who
 you


are
 in
 your
 capacity.
 Don't
 impose
 those


limitations
 on
 yourself.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 this
 that
 photo
 I
 showed


you
 before
 we
 started
 recording
 that


LeBron
 posted
 is
 a
 pretty
 iconic


example.
 I'll
 put
 it
 on
 the
 screen,
 but


it
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 I
 think
 all
 the


vice
 presidents
 that
 came
 before
 you,


and
 frankly,
 they
 all
 look
 the
 same.


>> So,


one
 might
 fall
 into
 the
 trap
 of
 thinking


that
 if
 I
 don't
 look
 like
 this,
 then
 I


can't
 do
 this
 job.
 You
 know,
 that's
 what


I
 think
 the
 human
 mind
 logically
 might


arrive
 at
 that
 conclusion.
 It
 looks
 for


pattern
 recognition.
 It
 might
 think
 if


I'm
 not
 one
 of
 these
 here,
 one
 of
 these


men
 here
 with
 this
 suit
 on
 and
 this
 kind


of
 hair
 and
 this
 age,
 then
 that's
 not
 a


position
 I
 can
 thrive
 in.


>> I'll


see
 you
 and
 add
 one.


>> Okay.


>> And
 everyone
 else
 thinks
 that
 this
 is


the
 image
 of
 who
 can
 do
 the
 job.


>> Yeah.


So
 the
 added
 challenge
 is
 not
 only
 the


limitations
 one
 puts
 on
 themselves


but
 the
 limitations
 one
 might
 be
 met


with
 around
 other
 people's
 perceptions


about
 who
 can
 do
 what.


>> And
 have
 you
 had
 that
 through
 your


career?


>> Yes.
 Is
 there
 any
 particular
 examples


that
 always
 sit
 at
 the
 front
 of
 your


mind
 where
 you
 really
 really
 felt
 that


the
 room
 you
 were
 in,
 people
 were


discounting
 you
 purely
 based
 on


appearance
 or
 gender
 or
 race
 or
 anything


like
 that?


>> I
 mean,
 there
 are
 times
 in
 my
 career


when
 I
 walked
 in
 the
 room
 and
 someone


said,
 you
 know,
 something
 along
 if
 they


didn't
 know
 me.


>> Mhm.


>> If
 they
 didn't
 know
 what
 they
 were


walking
 into,
 you
 know,
 they
 were


waiting
 for
 my
 boss.


And
 how
 did
 you
 deal
 with
 that?
 How
 do


you
 stop
 that
 suppressing
 you?
 Because


it's
 very
 easy
 to
 feel
 that
 and
 go
 and


to
 shrink.


>> You
 will
 often
 be,
 you
 may
 often
 be
 the


only
 one
 who
 walks
 into
 a
 boardroom,
 a


courtroom,
 a
 meeting
 room,


who
 looks
 like
 yourself
 or
 has
 had
 your


life
 experiences.


But
 when
 you
 walk
 in
 that
 room,
 walk
 in


that
 room,
 chin
 up,
 shoulders
 back,


knowing
 there
 are
 so
 many
 people
 who
 are


not
 in
 that
 room,


>> who
 are
 so
 proud
 of
 you
 walking
 in
 that


room
 and
 expect
 that
 you
 will
 use
 the


voice
 that
 you
 carry.


>> Mhm.
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 there
 are
 there


are
 tools
 that
 one
 has
 to
 employ
 when


you
 otherwise
 are
 aware
 that
 you
 might


be
 presenting
 the
 unfamiliar.


>> But
 but
 but
 what
 I
 also
 would
 caution
 is


is
 don't
 walk
 in
 that
 room
 with
 the


assumption
 that
 your
 value
 will
 not
 be


recognized.
 Right?
 And
 so
 again,
 this


gets
 back
 to
 my
 point
 about
 we
 all
 have


to
 moderate
 what
 limitations
 are
 we


putting
 on
 ourselves


with
 what
 limitations
 are
 being
 sent
 our


way.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 tools,


>> well,
 just
 like
 that,
 don't
 don't
 when


you
 walk
 into
 that
 room,
 see
 all
 the


people.
 I
 think
 sometimes
 of
 Mrs.


Francis
 Wilson,
 who
 was
 my
 first
 grade


teacher
 who
 attended
 my
 law
 school


graduation.


I
 think
 of
 my
 mother
 who
 would
 say
 to
 me


calmly
 don't
 you
 ever
 let
 anyone
 tell


you
 who
 you
 are
 you
 tell
 them
 who
 you


are
 right
 and
 you
 think
 of
 these
 people


when
 you
 walk
 into
 these
 important
 rooms


to
 remind
 you


>> I
 I
 it's
 a
 tool
 I
 have
 used
 over
 a


period
 of
 time
 and
 um
 and
 it
 has
 served


me
 well
 yes
 there's
 Mrs.
 Wilson.
 That's


at
 my
 law
 school
 graduation.
 And
 that's


my
 mother.
 That's
 exactly
 right.
 How


about
 that?
 Yeah.
 Where'd
 you
 get
 all


these
 pictures?


>> Well,
 stopping
 you,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 Mrs.
 Wilson.


>> And
 so,
 why
 is
 thinking
 of
 Mrs.
 Wilson


helping
 you
 when
 you
 walk
 into
 those


rooms?


Because


there
 is,
 I
 think,
 a
 key
 to
 success


that
 each
 of
 us
 who
 has
 achieved
 success


probably
 shares,
 which
 is
 there
 has
 been


someone
 at
 least,
 and
 it
 could
 be
 a


parent,
 it
 could
 be
 a
 teacher,
 it
 could


be
 a
 neighbor,
 it
 could
 be
 a
 pastor,


someone
 who
 convinced
 you
 you
 were


special.


You
 may
 not
 have
 been
 particularly


special,
 but
 they
 told
 you
 you
 were
 and


you
 believed
 them.


I
 know
 that's
 true
 for
 me.
 I
 may
 not


have
 been
 particularly
 special,
 but
 I


had
 a
 few
 people
 who
 told
 me
 I
 was
 and
 I


believed
 them.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 and
 but
 with
 that
 came


therefore
 don't
 do
 this
 thing.


>> Mhm.


>> Cuz
 you're
 you
 know
 you
 shouldn't
 be


doing
 that
 thing
 but
 go
 in
 that
 room.
 I


think
 uh
 you
 know
 when
 we
 talk
 about


mentorship,
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


signals
 that
 we
 as
 a
 society
 send
 to


children
 and
 I
 mean
 all
 of
 our
 children,


our
 own
 children,
 the
 children
 of
 a


community
 which
 we
 should
 think
 of
 as


our
 children.


to
 send
 them
 signals
 that
 tell
 them
 they


are
 special
 and
 then
 back
 that
 up
 with


giving
 them
 the
 resources


would
 make
 us
 a
 much
 stronger
 society.


as
 you
 said
 that
 I
 was
 reflecting
 on


little
 passing
 comments
 people
 in
 my


life
 made
 at
 certain
 points
 that
 at
 the


time
 I
 was
 suspicious
 about
 like
 you


know
 them
 telling
 you
 that
 you're
 going


to
 be
 special
 or
 do
 something
 great
 one


day
 that
 I
 might
 have
 not
 fully
 believed


myself
 but
 I
 believe
 they
 believed
 it


>> right


>> and
 that
 was
 enough


>> but
 that's
 that's
 what
 I'm
 saying
 they


told
 me
 and
 I
 believed
 them
 I
 didn't


think
 of
 it
 and
 maybe
 that's
 why
 I
 don't


look
 in
 the
 mirror
 and
 see
 all
 these


things


but
 yes


>> have
 you
 got
 any
 tools
 around
 how
 you've


leared
 to
 hold
 yourself.


>> Thinking
 back
 to
 24y
 old
 comma
 versus


this
 Kamla,
 is
 there
 a
 certain
 way
 you


hold
 yourself
 in
 those
 rooms
 that
 also


garners
 that
 respect?
 I
 noticed
 when
 you


speak,
 you
 you
 don't
 rush
 and
 I
 think


people
 that
 are
 younger
 in
 their
 career,


they
 tend
 to


>> Yeah.
 Right.


>> Because
 they're
 they're
 kind
 of
 almost


trying
 to
 excuse
 the
 amount
 of
 time


they're
 taking
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 are
 a


bit
 more


>> I
 just
 wondering
 if
 there's
 anything


you've
 any
 tools
 in
 that
 regard
 that


have
 helped.


It's
 important
 to
 have
 some
 sense
 of


conceptually


>> what
 you
 mean
 to
 say
 and
 you
 not
 that


you
 have
 to
 rehearse
 what
 you're
 going


to
 speak
 before
 you
 speak
 it
 but
 do
 have


a
 sense
 of
 what
 you
 intend
 to


communicate.


>> Mhm.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 important
 to


especially
 with
 complex
 issues
 in
 the


context
 of
 a
 discussion


deconstruct


in
 your
 mind
 what
 the
 issue
 is


>> so
 you
 can
 speak
 logically.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 what
 about
 appearance
 generally?
 Do


you
 think
 much
 about
 that?
 So
 do
 you


think
 much
 about
 because
 you're
 I
 mean


you
 look
 very
 your
 outfit's
 stunning


today.


>> You're
 very


>> Does
 it
 matter?


>> Sadly
 it
 does.


>> It
 does.
 I
 mean
 depending
 on
 context.
 Um


sadly
 it
 does.
 I
 I
 we
 are
 still
 I
 think


in
 a
 world
 where
 the
 way
 you
 appear
 when


you
 walk
 in
 the
 room


impacts
 first
 impressions.


>> Mhm.


um
 including
 just
 for
 example
 again
 even


in
 mentoring
 people
 people
 will
 look
 at


their
 watch
 or
 their
 phone
 to
 see
 if


you've
 walked
 in
 the
 room
 on
 time


>> and
 will
 judge
 something
 about
 your


character


>> that
 the
 piece
 of
 how
 you
 look
 that
 is


going
 to
 suggest
 the
 pride
 that
 one
 has


in
 themselves


>> as
 a
 matter
 of
 self-respect
 I
 mean
 I've


always
 this
 is
 you
 know
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 the


black
 church,


you
 dress
 up


>> and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 reflection
 of
 your


dignity


and
 the
 respect
 you
 have
 for
 the
 place


that
 you
 may
 be.


>> And
 in
 January
 2019,
 you
 launched
 your


presidential
 campaign
 for
 the
 first


time,
 which
 was
 up
 until
 you
 you
 dropped


out
 later
 that
 year
 in
 December.


>> Correct.


>> Why
 did
 you
 drop
 out
 of
 that
 uh


presidential
 race?
 What's
 the
 what's
 the


full
 context
 behind
 the
 scenes?
 There


was
 a
 lot
 there.
 Um,


mostly
 we
 ran
 out
 of
 money.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 of
 lessons
 obviously


about
 running.
 Um,
 but
 that
 was
 that
 was


the
 main
 reason.


>> And
 at
 some
 point
 you
 get
 a
 call
 from


Mr.
 President.


>> Mhm.
 I
 got
 a
 call
 from
 then
 nominee,


Democratic
 nominee
 Joe
 Biden.
 He
 um
 we


facetimed
 it
 was
 during
 the
 height
 of


COVID.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 he
 asked
 me
 to
 be
 his
 running
 mate.


and
 it
 was
 a
 a
 great
 honor
 and
 I
 was


honored
 to
 do
 it.


>> Did
 you
 have
 any
 inclination
 before
 that


moment
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 you?


>> Had
 there
 been
 like
 a
 side
 conversation?


>> So,
 no.
 I
 had
 an
 interview.
 I
 had
 an


interview
 and
 it
 was
 like
 something
 out


of
 a
 spy
 movie
 where
 I
 had
 my
 assistant


drove
 me
 to
 one
 location.
 This
 was
 in


DC.
 And
 then
 it
 was
 a
 mall.
 And
 then
 I


got
 out
 of
 that
 car
 to
 get
 in
 another


car
 that
 was
 because
 the
 press
 were


watching
 everything
 to
 see
 who
 there
 was


a
 short
 list
 that
 was
 out
 who
 was
 going


to
 be.
 So
 we
 had
 to
 do
 this
 whole


clandestine
 thing.
 And
 then
 I
 got
 into


another
 car
 being
 driven
 by
 one
 of
 his


assistants
 and
 then
 we
 went
 to
 this,
 you


know,
 this
 very
 circuitous
 route
 to
 a


house
 and
 then
 through
 the
 back
 door.


The
 windows
 were
 closed,
 the
 shades
 were


closed
 and
 I
 had
 my
 interview.
 went
 back


to
 because
 Doug
 and
 I
 were
 in
 our


apartment
 in
 DC
 because
 I
 was
 senator
 at


the
 time
 and
 again
 height
 of
 COVID
 then


the
 vans
 the
 press
 vans
 were
 parked
 out


front
 and
 we
 would
 just
 want
 to
 go
 for
 a


walk.
 Remember
 during
 co
 everyone
 just


wanted
 to
 get
 some
 fresh
 air
 they
 must


have
 thought
 we
 couldn't
 see
 them.
 They


were
 like
 in
 unmarked
 vans.
 So
 from
 time


to
 time
 I
 just
 walked
 up
 to
 him
 and
 say


we're
 going
 to
 get
 some
 coffee.
 Can
 I


bring
 you
 anything
 back?
 We'll
 be
 right


back.
 I
 the
 day
 I
 actually
 got
 the
 call


from
 from
 Joe
 Biden
 asking
 me
 to
 run


with
 him
 was
 the
 same
 day
 earlier
 where


one
 of
 my
 girlfriends
 has
 a
 house
 in


Virginia
 and
 it
 was
 the
 end
 of
 summer


and
 she
 had
 all
 these
 beautiful
 end
 of


summer
 tomatoes.


>> I
 like
 to
 cook.
 She
 brought
 me
 this
 big


box
 of
 tomatoes
 and
 I
 was
 going
 to
 make


a
 bunch
 of
 marinara


>> and
 freeze
 it.
 Then
 I
 get
 the
 call
 from


him.
 I
 said
 yes,
 of
 course.
 And
 I
 don't


know,
 it
 felt
 like
 within
 seconds


a
 parade
 of
 people
 walk
 into
 our


apartment
 with
 a
 parade
 of
 binders
 sit


down.
 Everyone's
 in
 masks
 to
 tell
 us,


"Okay,
 this
 is
 what
 the
 campaign
 is


going
 to
 be."
 And
 because
 I
 hate
 to


waste
 food,
 every
 one
 of
 them
 walked
 out


with
 me
 handing
 them
 to
 as
 they
 left.


>> I'm
 so
 intrigued
 to
 know.
 I've
 done
 many


interviews
 in
 my
 life.
 I've
 been
 in
 a


couple
 of
 interviews
 myself.
 How
 does


someone
 get
 interviewed
 to
 be
 the
 vice


president?
 like
 what
 are
 the
 questions


one
 is
 asked?


>> Well,
 having
 been
 in
 the
 position
 of


both
 being
 the
 interviewer
 and
 the


interviewee,


>> yeah,


>> um
 it
 really
 as
 much
 as
 anything
 comes


down
 to
 chemistry.


>> Oh,
 okay.


>> Because
 by
 the
 time
 that
 that
 interview


is
 happening,
 it's
 usually
 narrowed
 down


to
 about
 three
 people.


So,
 all
 the
 vetting
 has
 been
 done.
 I


mean,
 my
 the
 vetting
 I
 had
 such
 a


truncated
 experience
 when
 I
 was
 running


for
 president
 of
 of
 just
 a
 couple
 of


weeks,
 but
 I
 think
 Joe
 Biden
 took
 like


nine
 weeks
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
 And
 so


there's
 vetting
 when
 I
 was
 being
 vetted


for
 vice
 president.
 I
 had
 a
 I
 don't
 know


9-hour
 interview
 with
 a
 lawyer
 going


through
 everything,
 everything.
 My


taxes,
 my
 professional
 record,


everything
 that
 was
 everything,


everything.
 I
 mean,
 talk
 about
 a


colonoscopy.


>> It
 was
 just
 virtually.
 That's
 kind
 of


what
 it
 was.
 And
 so
 when
 all
 of
 that
 has


been
 done
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 green
 light,


green
 light
 through
 that,
 then
 it's


about
 sitting
 down
 and
 just
 deciding
 um


because
 it
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


partnership,
 right?
 And
 it
 has
 to
 be
 it


has
 to
 be
 where
 you
 feel
 that
 you
 can


trust
 someone.
 You
 you
 could
 work
 with


them.
 You
 are
 you're
 doing
 it
 for
 the


same
 reasons.


>> Was
 it
 what
 you
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


be


>> being
 vice
 president?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 what
 it
 would
 be


because
 there's
 nothing
 that
 can
 compare


to
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 the
 49th
 vice


president
 of the
 United
 States.
 There


have
 only
 been
 48
 before
 me.
 Right.


>> Mhm.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 anything
 can


truly
 prepare
 you
 for
 what
 it
 is
 because


it
 is
 um
 a
 very
 unique
 position
 where


you
 are


again
 you
 are
 number
 two
 in
 command.


>> Wow.
 you.
 So
 the
 the
 seriousness
 of
 the


responsibility
 is
 is
 that
 um
 I
 I
 give


all
 credit
 to
 now
 the
 late
 President


Jimmy
 Carter
 who
 decided
 when
 he
 was


president
 having
 come
 off
 of
 you
 Kennedy


and
 Nixon
 and
 everything.
 He
 decided


that
 the
 vice
 president
 should
 be
 given


greater
 responsibilities
 than
 had
 been


the
 case
 because
 God
 forbid
 something


happens
 to
 the
 president.
 There
 should


be
 a
 smooth
 succession.
 And
 so
 Walter


Montdale
 was
 his
 vice
 president
 and
 was


the
 first
 to
 have
 an
 office
 in
 the
 West


Wing.


>> Mhm.


>> The
 responsibilities
 were
 again
 to
 meet


with
 world
 leaders.
 The
 responsibilities


were
 to
 travel
 the
 country
 um
 on
 behalf


of
 our
 administration
 and
 our
 policies.


Um
 it's
 it's
 an
 incredible


responsibility
 and
 um
 you
 know
 meeting


with
 the
 variety
 of
 people
 who
 for
 the


most
 part
 just
 want
 us
 to
 achieve
 good


things.
 When
 I
 was
 reading
 your
 book
 107


days,
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 really


surprising
 things
 was
 but
 also
 makes


sense
 when
 I
 understand
 human
 nature
 was


that
 you
 talk
 about
 how
 some
 of
 the


president's
 staff
 were
 basically


suppressing
 you
 a
 little
 bit,


suppressing
 your
 accomplishments
 because


you're
 a
 threat
 to
 them
 and
 you
 I
 think


you
 were
 told
 pretty
 early
 on
 or
 you
 had


heard
 pretty
 early
 on
 from
 a
 chief
 of


staff
 that


>> the
 the
 vice
 president
 is
 kind
 of
 seen


as
 a
 threat
 to
 the
 president.
 So,
 the


lore
 has
 it
 that


the
 outgoing
 chief
 of
 staff
 to
 the


president
 will
 tell
 the
 incoming
 chief


of
 staff
 to
 the
 incoming
 president


regardless
 of
 political
 party.
 Rule


number
 one,
 watch
 the
 vice
 president.


Lore
 has
 it
 that
 that's
 the
 case.
 And
 um


and
 then
 I
 had
 of
 course
 run
 against
 Joe


Biden.
 I
 was
 very
 and
 acutely
 aware
 that


I
 would
 have
 to


over
 and
 over
 again
 prove
 my
 loyalty


that
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 assumed.


>> You
 say
 in
 the
 book
 the
 president
 staff


was
 adding
 fuel
 to
 negative
 narratives


that
 sprung
 up
 about
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 president's
 inner
 circle
 seemed
 fine


with
 it.
 Indeed,
 it
 seemed
 as
 if
 they


decided
 I
 should
 be
 knocked
 down
 a


little
 bit
 more.


>> Yeah.
 I
 was
 shocked
 when
 I
 read
 that
 but


at
 the
 same
 time
 understood
 it


>> because
 it's
 human
 nature
 but
 also


shocked


because
 one
 wouldn't
 expect


>> it
 was
 and
 it
 was
 counterproductive


was
 absolutely
 counterproductive.
 Was


there
 a
 particular
 moment
 where
 you


realized
 that
 this
 was
 happening


for
 the
 first
 time?


>> To
 be
 candid
 with
 you,
 I


had
 a
 sense
 of
 it
 for
 quite
 some
 time,


but
 it
 was
 after
 the
 election
 that
 I


really
 started
 to
 hear
 the
 stories
 about


it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 had
 a
 sense
 of
 it.
 It


was
 clear
 to
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 just
 the


challenges
 with
 getting
 them
 to
 uplift,


getting
 them
 to
 defend,
 especially
 when


there
 were
 inaccurate,
 unfair
 attacks.


And
 then
 I
 started
 to
 hear
 more
 stories


after.


>> And
 what
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 when
 there


were
 unfair
 media
 attacks
 on
 you
 that


could
 quite
 easily
 have
 been
 rebuttled


or


>> debunked,
 there
 was
 no
 desire
 to
 debunk


them.


>> There
 was
 there
 the
 staff
 and
 the


resources
 under
 the
 president
 as


compared
 to
 the
 vice
 president
 are


enormous.
 Mhm.


>> And
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 the
 vice


president
 is
 being
 attacked,
 resources


were
 available
 but
 not
 used
 to


defend
 the
 vice
 president
 in
 the
 way


that
 they
 could
 have
 that
 would
 have


inured
 to
 the
 benefit
 of
 everyone


involved.


>> Cuz
 that's
 what
 I
 think.
 There
 was
 an


argument
 to
 say
 it
 was
 in
 their


interests
 because
 if
 the
 if
 if
 you
 and


Joe
 Biden
 are
 strong,
 you're
 more
 like


Joe
 Biden's
 more
 likely
 to
 then
 win
 the


next
 election.
 Exactly.
 That's
 my
 point.


We
 rose
 and
 fell
 together.


>> Yeah.


And
 did
 did
 he
 did
 Joe
 Biden
 know
 that


that
 was
 happening?


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 he
 did,


>> but
 it's
 the
 staff
 underneath
 him
 that


are
 in
 charge
 of
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 they
 would
 they
 So,
 you're


saying
 that
 that
 you
 think
 they
 they


wanted
 you
 to
 be
 weaker
 in
 public


perception
 because
 that
 kind
 of
 keeps


you
 in
 your
 place?


>> I


think
 that
 that
 was
 part
 of
 it.
 I
 do.
 I


think
 that
 they
 decided
 that,
 you
 know,


there
 are
 far
 too
 many
 people
 in
 this


world
 and
 in
 professional
 life


who
 approach
 things
 with
 a
 zero-
 sum


game.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> If
 I
 have
 more,
 you
 have
 less.


And
 it
 is
 incredibly
 shortsighted.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 actually
 quite
 provincial


thinking
 when
 you're
 talking
 about
 the


stakes
 that
 were
 at
 play


>> in
 our
 administration
 and
 of
 course
 in


the
 election


>> and
 they
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 in
 the


book
 as
 well
 in
 on
 page
 47
 of
 107
 days


that
 they
 also
 didn't


promote
 your
 accomplishments
 because


when
 I
 read
 through
 all
 the
 research
 of


the
 things
 that
 you
 had
 accomplished
 I


wasn't
 aware


>> I
 know


>> there
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 megaphone


shouting
 about
 the
 things
 you


accomplished.
 So,
 um
 it


>> was
 very
 frustrating.
 I
 can't
 even
 tell


you.
 Frustrating
 and
 painful


>> really.


>> And
 well,
 and
 also
 not
 just
 for
 me,
 but


for
 the
 people
 who
 knew
 my
 career
 and


knew
 what
 was
 not
 being
 said
 and
 what


was
 being
 said.


>> What
 wasn't
 being
 said,


>> the
 accomplishments,
 the
 um
 the
 the
 the


credibility
 of
 um
 of
 my
 leadership.


They
 thought
 that,
 and
 you
 say
 this
 on


page
 51,
 if
 you
 were
 shining,
 then
 Joe


Biden
 was
 dimmed.
 So,
 it
 was
 very
 much


in
 their
 interests
 to


make
 sure
 you
 were
 dimmed.


One
 one
 could
 argue
 then
 so
 that
 Joe


Biden
 was
 shining.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 was
 um


again,
 it
 was
 very
 shortsighted.


>> Are
 you
 friends
 with
 Joe
 Biden?


>> Yes.


>> Is
 the
 relationship
 good?


>> It's
 a
 good
 relationship.
 I
 just
 talked


to
 him.


two
 days
 ago
 he
 called
 me
 for
 my


birthday.


>> Is
 it
 Is
 it
 complicated?


>> Yes,
 it's
 very
 complicated.


>> It
 is.
 And
 as
 I
 write
 in
 the
 book,
 I
 um


it
 is
 very
 complicated.
 I
 have
 a
 great


deal
 of
 affection
 for
 him.
 Um,
 and


there
 were
 times
 that
 I've
 been
 quite


candid
 about
 where
 he


greatly
 disappointed
 me


and
 frankly,
 you
 know,
 angered
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> Can
 you
 give
 me
 context
 on
 it
 where
 he


disappointed
 and
 angered
 you?


>> So,
 I
 write
 um
 and
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I


thought
 about
 this.
 Was
 I
 going to
 write


about
 it
 or
 not?
 And
 I
 I
 decided
 in


writing
 this
 book,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 just


be
 honest
 and
 these
 are
 the
 facts
 and


the
 reader
 can
 take
 what
 they
 want
 from


it.
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 debate,
 my
 debate


with
 Trump.


And
 you
 know,
 so
 going
 into
 a


presidential
 debate
 is
 an
 incredibly


intense
 and
 intensive
 project,
 including


what
 has
 historically
 happened
 that
 we


even
 called
 debate
 camp.


>> Can
 you
 imagine?
 And
 it's
 no
 camp
 at


all.
 It's
 going
 into


um
 where
 you
 basically
 are
 sequestered


for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 immediately
 before


the
 debate.


Where
 did
 you
 get
 all
 of
 these?
 This
 is


Phipe
 who
 played
 Donald
 Trump


>> in
 your
 debate
 camp.


>> In
 my
 debate
 camp
 and
 he
 never
 broke


character
 ever.


>> So
 this
 is
 a
 fake
 Trump
 that
 was
 brought


in.


>> This
 is
 the
 fake
 Trump.
 He
 would
 do
 the


makeup,
 the
 orange
 makeup,
 the
 long
 red


tie.
 He
 was
 just
 awful.


Awful.
 awful
 in
 the
 best
 way
 in
 trying


to
 get
 me
 prepared
 and
 um
 and
 there
 were


a
 lot
 of
 people
 like
 Phipe
 there
 were
 a


lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 you
 know
 I
 I'm


very
 fortunate
 I
 have
 people
 who
 have


been
 with
 me
 for
 years
 and
 years
 and


years
 through
 these
 various
 offices
 and


you
 know
 even
 if
 they
 go
 on
 to
 different


positions
 they
 always
 come
 back
 when


needed
 and
 so
 debate
 camp
 was
 this


intense
 basically
 a
 preparation
 process


where
 you


you
 know
 your
 team
 will
 basically
 try
 to


they'll
 break
 you
 and
 then
 build
 you


back
 up.
 So
 the
 day
 of
 the
 debate
 was


after
 that
 intense
 period
 of
 preparation


and
 then
 that
 morning
 I
 had
 a
 meeting


with
 my
 team.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


be
 more
 prep
 but
 they
 actually
 were


wonderful
 and
 just
 basically
 said
 to
 me


you're
 ready.


So,
 okay
 then
 being
 a
 woman
 running
 for


president
 and
 many
 women
 in
 various
 high


level
 positions
 get
 their
 hair
 and


makeup
 done.
 Back
 to
 your
 point
 about


presentation
 and
 it
 can
 take
 hours.


>> Hair
 and
 makeup
 got
 done.
 I'm
 in
 the


hotel
 room
 with
 Doug,
 with
 my
 husband,


and
 the
 president
 calls
 and
 I
 they
 I
 was


told
 that
 he
 wanted
 to
 call
 me
 so
 that


I'd
 be
 ready.
 And
 I
 was
 so
 sure
 it
 was


to
 buck
 me
 up
 and
 go
 go
 get
 him.


And
 he
 did
 say
 that
 for
 the
 first
 beat.


And
 then
 he
 went
 on
 to
 talk
 about
 a


group
 of
 people
 in
 Pennsylvania
 who
 were


saying
 bad
 things
 about
 me.


because
 they
 heard
 I
 was
 saying
 bad


things
 about
 him.
 And
 when
 I
 hung
 up
 the


phone,
 I
 was
 just


I
 was
 it
 was
 unbelievable.
 And
 I
 was


Yes,
 I
 was
 angry
 and
 deeply


disappointed.


It
 just
 it
 was
 so
 unnecessary.
 There


only
 two
 people
 in
 the
 world
 other
 than


me
 that
 has
 debated
 this
 guy,
 Hillary


Clinton
 and
 him.
 And
 you
 know
 what
 it's


like?
 It's
 going
 into
 a
 debate
 with
 the


stakes
 being
 that
 high
 and
 and
 Trump


hadn't
 agreed
 to
 another
 debate.


The
 stakes
 were
 so
 high.


So
 that's
 an
 example
 of
 what
 I
 mean.


>> You
 took
 something
 from
 that.
 You
 took
 a


an
 underlying
 message
 about
 one's


intentions
 from
 that.
 cuz
 I
 would
 if


someone
 called
 me
 in
 the
 leadup
 to
 de


debate
 prep
 and
 said
 something
 like
 that


to
 me,
 I
 would
 assume
 that
 they
 don't


want
 the
 best
 for
 me.


>> My
 takeaway
 is
 his
 motivation
 was
 all


about
 himself.


>> That's
 what
 I
 would
 assume
 from
 that.
 I


would
 assume
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Right.
 Obviously,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> It
 wasn't
 about
 my
 performance
 at
 the


debate.


>> Do
 you
 think
 he
 wanted
 you
 to
 win
 the


election?


I
 do
 because


I
 was
 the
 only
 one
 who
 would
 be
 able
 to


preserve
 his
 legacy.


>> But
 even
 that's
 about
 him.


>> Well,
 if
 I
 had
 to
 assume
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 why
 he'd
 want
 me
 to
 win


if
 Yeah.


And
 of
 course,
 you
 know
 that
 this
 all


wouldn't
 be
 happening.
 I
 don't
 think


anybody


who
 cares
 about
 the
 future
 of
 the


country
 um
 the
 democracy
 or
 even
 just


protecting
 the
 Constitution
 of
 the


United
 States
 would
 have
 wanted
 this.


Yeah.


just
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 reminder
 to
 me
 that
 a


lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 highest
 places
 in


in
 power
 are
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


self-focused.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 that
 is
 the
 case.


>> I
 think
 it
 um
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 case.


I've
 seen
 it.


>> I've
 seen
 it.


>> Maybe
 dare
 I
 say
 that
 it
 that's
 how
 they


get
 there.


I
 think
 that
 may
 be
 a
 big
 part
 of
 it
 if


they
 don't
 have
 something
 else
 that
 is


the
 pull
 or
 the
 push.


>> Yeah.
 Cuz
 I
 look
 at
 your
 life
 and
 your


career
 and
 I
 see
 a
 dedication
 to
 the


same
 thing
 which
 is
 like
 serving
 people


and
 it's
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 financial


opportunities
 and
 other
 opportunities


you
 could
 have
 pursued
 and
 it
 seems
 to


be
 really
 really
 authentic
 to
 me
 that


your
 your
 agenda
 was
 to
 serve
 people.
 Um


I
 can't
 say
 that
 about
 everybody
 else


that
 I've
 studied
 or
 interviewed
 in
 the


political
 environment.
 And
 the
 other


thing
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 so
 I
 watch


all
 these
 debates.
 I've
 been
 I'm
 such
 a


big
 fan
 of
 American
 politics.
 So
 I
 was
 I


was
 up
 at
 12
 years
 old
 watching
 Obama


get
 inaugurated
 or
 whatever
 it
 was.
 I


can't
 it
 was
 roughly
 I
 was
 a
 young
 kid


at
 the
 time.


>> I
 I
 stay
 up
 and
 watch
 all
 the
 debates.
 I


always
 have
 since
 I
 was
 a
 kid.
 I
 watched


that
 debate.
 But
 the
 debate
 that
 came


before
 with
 Biden
 and
 Trump.


>> It
 was
 so
 apparently
 clear.


>> Yeah.


>> That
 this
 was
 not
 okay.


>> And
 it
 felt
 like
 it
 felt
 like
 the
 whole


of
 the
 Democratic
 side
 of
 politics
 was


pretending
 everything
 was
 okay.
 Mhm.


>> That's
 kind
 of
 my
 observation
 from
 the


UK.
 I
 was
 like,
 why
 are
 they
 all


pretending
 everything's
 fine?
 But
 this


was
 clearly
 an
 individual
 that
 was
 very


much
 struggling
 with
 articulation,
 with


ideas,


>> and
 in
 the
 face
 of
 someone
 like
 Trump


who


>> to
 his
 credit


is
 able
 to
 pounce
 on
 that
 to
 be
 very


clear.
 and
 and
 he
 and
 he
 interestingly


enough
 because
 of
 course
 I
 watched
 that


debate
 very
 closely
 for
 many
 many


reasons
 including
 um
 I
 had
 four


interviews


right
 after
 his
 debate


>> okay


>> to
 speak
 on
 behalf
 of
 the
 president


during
 the
 debate
 and
 what
 was


interesting
 in
 that
 debate
 was
 also
 to


watch
 how
 it's
 a
 very
 rare
 circumstance


that
 you
 see
 Donald
 Trump
 actually


moderate


it
 was
 fascinating


You
 must
 have
 known.
 You
 must
 have
 you


sat
 you
 sat
 there.
 You
 were
 in
 LA
 at
 the


time,
 right?


>> I
 was
 in
 LA
 at
 the
 Fairmont
 Hotel


>> watching


>> watching


>> and


>> taking
 vigorous
 notes.
 I
 had
 ordered,


you
 know,
 like
 they
 had
 a
 little
 crude


tape
 plate
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "No,
 this
 is


a
 pizza
 night.
 Ordered
 pizza
 for


everyone."
 I
 had
 my
 a
 number
 of
 people


with
 me,
 but
 I
 had
 a
 tight
 group
 of


people
 with
 me
 in
 the
 room.


He
 called
 me
 from
 debate
 camp.


>> Mhm.


>> The
 president
 did,
 Biden
 did.
 And
 I


could
 tell
 something
 was
 a
 little
 off.


And


I
 was
 concerned
 about
 I
 I
 just
 he
 I


don't
 think
 he
 wanted
 to
 debate
 is
 my


point.
 He
 didn't
 want
 that
 debate.
 And


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 any
 competition
 you


go
 in,
 whether
 it's
 you're
 bidding
 for


something,
 you're
 if
 it's
 sports,
 you


got
 to
 want
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 If
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the


competition,


>> it
 will
 absolutely
 have
 an
 impact
 on


your
 performance.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 he


I'm
 pretty
 sure
 he
 did
 not
 want
 to


debate.


>> How
 do
 you
 know?
 What
 were
 the
 signs?


>> Well,
 we
 had
 conversations
 about
 it.
 I


think
 he
 got
 talked
 into
 it.
 And
 in
 any


event,
 so
 I'm
 watching
 the
 debate
 with


my
 tight
 team.
 I
 wanted
 it
 to
 be
 a
 small


team
 so
 I
 could
 just
 be
 candid
 as
 it's


happening
 because
 I
 know
 I
 have
 four


interviews
 right
 after.
 And
 you
 know,
 in


every
 debate,
 I
 don't
 care
 who
 you
 are,


there
 will
 be
 statistic
 wrong
 or
 you


know,
 you
 name
 this
 country,
 but
 it
 was


that
 country.
 That
 always
 happens.
 There


is
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 a
 perfect
 debate.
 So


there
 will
 be
 something
 to
 clean
 up.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 expected
 that.


And
 then,
 you
 know,
 we
 saw
 what
 we
 all


saw.


>> It
 was
 a
 car
 crash.
 It
 was
 a
 historic


car
 crash.
 I
 actually
 can't
 think
 of
 a


>> I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 historian
 of
 these


debates
 because
 I
 I
 think
 they're


fascinating
 sort
 of
 experiments
 and


demonstrations
 of
 human
 psychology
 and


how
 these
 zingers
 emerge
 and
 the
 binders


full
 of
 women
 thing
 and
 you
 know
 the


Obama's
 whole
 thing
 about
 the
 um


>> the
 Romney
 and
 Obama
 in
 that
 debate


where
 they
 talked
 about
 the
 the
 the


military
 was
 no
 longer
 horses
 and


bayonets.
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 so


interesting
 because
 it's
 funny
 how
 a
 a


sentence
 or
 a
 phrase
 can
 sway
 the


general
 public
 in
 such
 a
 profound
 way


>> and
 stick


>> and
 stick
 and
 then
 as
 a
 marketer
 I
 spent


10
 years
 in
 marketing
 I
 think
 about
 this


a
 lot
 how
 like
 that
 that
 horses
 and


bayonets
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 can
 remember


that
 but
 I
 can't
 really
 remember


anything
 else


>> right
 that's
 interesting


>> you
 know
 the
 power
 of
 the
 words
 so
 that


in
 my
 view


>> and
 the
 delivery
 right
 so
 the
 words


combined
 with
 the
 delivery
 and
 the


timing


>> yeah
 and
 this
 is
 what
 you
 learn


>> that
 has
 to
 that
 all
 has
 to
 coincide


>> so
 what
 was
 real
 strategy
 going
 into


that
 debate
 with
 Trump
 because
 you
 had


those
 same
 moments
 where
 the
 cats
 and


the
 dogs
 and
 all
 those
 all
 that


unbelievable
 stuff
 and
 and
 also
 you
 it


at
 home
 I
 was
 thinking
 oh
 she's
 she's


trying
 to
 trigger
 him
 and
 it's
 working.


>> Yeah,
 because
 he's
 so
 predictable
 that


way.


>> What
 were
 those
 things
 for
 you?
 Well,


the
 first
 thing
 is
 that
 we
 had
 empty


pads
 on
 our
 um
 podium
 and
 in
 in
 the


debate
 camp
 and
 then
 therefore
 when
 I


walked
 on
 stage
 after
 I
 shook
 his
 hand


went
 back
 to
 my
 podium,
 I
 wrote
 a
 smiley


face


and
 cuz
 I
 just
 decided
 I
 was
 going
 to


have
 fun


because
 one
 of
 the
 things
 about
 these


kinds
 of
 debates
 in
 particular
 is
 the


person
 who's
 having
 fun
 wins.


That's
 so
 true.
 We
 watched
 it
 back
 the


other
 day
 and
 you're
 smiling


>> and
 you
 you
 look
 like
 you're
 enjoying
 it


and
 he
 looks
 frustrated.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 that
 was
 intentional
 was
 to
 if
 you


look
 like
 you're
 having
 fun,


>> well,
 have
 fun,
 but
 though
 not
 just
 look


cuz
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 look


like
 you're
 having
 fun
 if
 you're
 not,


right?


>> Um,


>> so
 you've
 got
 to
 find
 you've
 you
 have
 to


find
 you
 have
 to
 this
 is
 a
 true
 for


life.
 You
 got
 to
 see
 the
 humor
 in
 it.


Otherwise,
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 undo
 you.


Especially
 if
 you're
 dealing
 with
 heavy


stuff,
 you've
 got
 to
 see
 the
 humor
 in


it.
 And
 you
 know,
 like
 when
 he
 pulled


out
 the
 cats
 and
 dogs
 thing,


I
 couldn't
 even
 believe
 it.
 I
 couldn't


because
 here's
 what
 happened.
 So


I
 didn't
 know
 that
 he
 that
 this
 was


being
 said,
 right?


>> Let's
 give
 context
 for
 anyone
 that


doesn't
 know.


>> Okay.
 Yes.
 Right.
 you
 well


>> well
 so
 from
 what
 I
 understand
 it's


faint
 in
 my
 memory
 but
 um
 there
 was
 this


like
 crazy
 rumor
 that
 I
 think
 it
 was
 im


illegal
 immigrants
 were
 eating
 cats
 and


dogs


>> that
 Haitian
 immigrants
 regardless
 of


their
 legal
 status


>> in
 Ohio
 were
 eating
 their
 pets


>> cats
 and
 dogs


>> so
 I
 hadn't
 even
 heard
 about
 it
 cuz
 I'm


in
 debate
 camp
 right


and
 then
 two
 members
 of
 my
 team
 see
 him


get
 off


his
 his
 Trump
 plane
 with
 the
 main


purveyor
 of
 this
 nonsense


and
 then
 they
 realize
 if
 she's
 on
 the


plane
 with
 him
 it
 is
 very
 possible
 last


thing
 he
 heard
 was
 this
 thing.
 So
 they


last
 minute
 tell
 me
 by
 the
 way
 um
 a
 lot


of
 them
 call
 me
 boss
 because
 it's
 like


this
 is
 what
 you
 do
 in
 law
 enforcement


and
 it
 just
 stuck
 crazy.
 Hey
 boss,
 we


got
 to
 tell
 you
 something.
 We
 didn't


mention
 it
 to
 you.
 There's
 this
 whole


thing
 that
 they're
 saying
 on
 that
 side


about
 Haitian
 immigrants
 eating
 cats
 and


dogs.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 are
 you
 kidding


me?
 That's
 ridiculous.
 No,
 but
 it's
 what


they're
 saying.
 So
 just
 it
 may
 come
 up


in
 the
 debate.
 Sure
 enough,
 it
 did.
 But


see,
 here's
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 say


to
 you,
 Stephen,
 that


again,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I
 wrote
 the


book
 is
 also
 there
 are
 lessons
 to
 be


learned
 from
 those
 107
 days
 to
 be


applied
 today.


I
 believe
 that
 part
 of
 what
 is
 the


method
 is
 say
 the
 outrageous
 thing,


then
 everyone
 is
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 that


outrageous
 thing.


And
 meanwhile
 this
 is
 happening,


right?
 And
 so
 meanwhile


>> misdirection.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 misdirection
 includes,
 by
 the
 way,


talking
 about
 immigrants
 eating
 cats
 and


dogs
 and
 not
 talking
 about
 what's
 your


plan
 for
 working
 Americans
 to
 bring
 down


the
 prices.


So
 then
 the
 press
 covers
 that
 whole


thing
 and
 not
 oh
 where
 was
 his
 plan
 for


bringing
 down
 prices.


>> Here's
 what
 I've
 come
 to
 learn
 um
 in
 the


last
 sort
 of
 10
 years
 working
 in
 in


marketing
 is
 I
 have
 this
 um
 particular


chapter
 in
 my
 last
 book
 where
 I
 say


useless
 absurdity
 defines
 will
 define


you
 more
 as
 a
 brand
 than
 useful


practicality.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 this,


>> right,
 that's
 beautifully
 said,


>> is
 when
 I,
 this
 is
 the
 analogy
 I
 give.
 I


went
 to
 this
 gym
 in
 Canary
 Warf
 and
 I


walk
 in
 and
 it's
 got
 this
 100
 foot


climbing
 wall.
 It's
 massive
 gym,


incredible.
 I
 come
 home,
 I
 tell
 my


girlfriend,
 I
 go,
 "Babe,
 there's
 this


incredible
 gym."
 And
 then
 the
 next


sentence
 out
 of
 my
 mouth
 is
 the
 most


absurd
 thing
 because
 I
 know
 that
 will
 be


the
 most
 impactful.
 So
 I
 say,
 "They've


even
 got
 a
 100
 foot
 climbing
 wall."
 Cuz


if
 I
 say
 that,
 it
 implicitly
 tells
 them,


you
 know,
 tells
 my
 girlfriend,
 "This
 gym


is
 big."
 And
 and
 even
 in
 my
 last


company,
 the
 thing
 that
 the
 press


focused
 on
 in
 my
 office
 wasn't
 our
 work,


our
 case
 studies,
 the
 clients
 we
 had.
 It


was
 that
 we
 had
 this
 massive
 blue
 slide


that
 went
 into
 a
 ballpool.
 So
 whenever


the
 press
 came,
 they
 said,
 "Can
 you
 go


stand
 by
 the
 blue
 slide?"
 It
 was
 all


about
 this
 blue
 slide.
 The
 most
 absurd


thing
 gar
 all
 the
 attention.
 And
 I


actually
 think
 to


Trump's
 strategy
 is
 he
 leads
 with
 he's
 a


master
 labeler.
 Sleepy
 Joe.
 You
 know,


you
 can't


>> is
 very
 gifted.


Don't
 discount
 the
 guy
 in
 terms
 of
 that.


>> How
 do
 you
 beat
 someone
 playing
 that


game?


>> You
 have
 to
 be
 relentless
 on
 focusing
 on


what's
 actually
 happening.


>> Does
 that
 work?


>> And
 it
 means
 it
 means
 also


deconstructing.
 So
 that
 I
 mean
 one
 of


the
 things
 for
 example
 that
 I've
 been


talking
 about
 recently
 is
 there's
 a
 word


that
 applies
 so
 well
 to
 him
 in
 this
 era


which
 is
 a
 phrase
 gaslighting.


Right?
 So
 there's
 a
 whole
 lot
 of


gaslighting
 happening
 which
 is
 basically


misrepresenting,
 lying,
 scapegoating,


distracting,
 right,
 from
 what's
 really


occurring,
 including
 like
 this
 whole


thing
 where
 he's
 coming
 down
 so
 hard
 and


with
 these
 mass
 deportations
 which
 is


picking
 up
 a
 lot
 of
 American
 citizens
 by


the
 way
 in
 the
 process,
 hardworking


people
 in
 the
 process.
 And
 what
 he
 would


have
 people
 believe
 is
 that
 your


predicament


is
 because
 this
 is
 what
 he
 actually
 is


trying
 to
 sell.
 Your
 predicament
 is


because
 of
 relatively
 powerless
 people.


So
 you
 don't
 focus
 on
 the
 powerful


people.


He's
 basically
 saying
 to
 the
 American


people,
 you
 have
 less
 because
 of
 people


who
 have
 even
 less
 than
 you.
 Here's
 the


counterpoint.
 It
 works.


>> Yes,
 evidently.


But
 there
 is,
 you
 know,
 but
 at
 some


point
 the
 veneer
 and
 the
 the
 the


deflection


has
 to
 wear
 off.
 I
 don't
 know
 when


exactly
 that
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 I


think
 that,
 you
 know,
 listen,
 um,
 the


tariffs
 taking
 hold
 and
 when
 we
 get


around
 to
 the
 holiday
 season
 and
 people


realize
 how
 many
 toys
 are
 made
 in
 China,


what
 strengthens
 that
 approach
 is
 the


rapid
 amount
 of
 dis
 disinformation
 that


is
 spreading.
 It's
 so
 much
 and
 it
 just


spreads
 like
 wildfire.
 And
 trying
 to


stay
 in
 front
 of
 that
 with
 fact,
 much


less,
 to
 your
 point,
 practical
 messaging


and
 logic,
 it
 is
 a
 real
 challenge.
 It's


funny
 because
 I
 I
 sit
 here
 a
 lot
 with


neuroscientists
 and
 psychologists
 who


tell
 me
 about
 how
 the
 brain
 works
 and


they
 at
 a
 simple
 level
 they
 talk
 about


these
 two
 parts
 of
 the
 brain
 which
 is


like
 the
 rational
 prefrontal
 cortex
 and


then
 the
 emotional
 center
 like
 the
 lyic


system
 the
 amydala
 and
 they
 always
 tell


me
 that
 the
 most
 memorable
 um
 the
 part


of
 the
 brain
 that
 holds
 memories
 the


easiest
 and
 the
 best
 and
 that
 garners


the
 most
 attention
 is
 the
 emotional


center
 of
 the
 brain
 the
 amydala.
 So
 if
 I


say


>> that
 these
 people,
 these
 brown
 people


are
 coming
 over
 and
 they're
 rapists
 and


murderers.


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 much
 it's
 much
 more
 emotionally


captivating
 than
 you
 telling
 me
 about


like


>> statistics
 on
 on
 how
 America
 recovered


faster
 than
 any
 so-called
 wealthy


country
 economically
 from
 the
 pandmic.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I'll
 forget
 that
 within
 10


seconds
 of
 you
 just
 saying
 it.
 But
 the


rapist
 and
 murderers
 thing,
 like
 my


objective
 sense
 goes,
 well,
 no,
 come
 on.


It's
 not
 the
 problem.
 But
 there's
 part


of
 me
 that
 remembers
 that
 and
 that's


even
 as
 someone
 who
 I
 think
 is


relatively
 informed
 on
 the
 the
 reality


of
 the
 situation.
 I
 still
 I
 remember
 um


Dr.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Dr.
 Tally
 Sharet.


She's
 a
 neuroscientist.
 So
 she


understands
 that
 vaccines
 don't
 give


kids
 autism.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 she
 recalls
 this
 time
 in
 the


election
 many.


She
 recalls
 um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Ben


Carlson
 or
 someone
 talking
 about
 the


science
 and
 then
 she
 the
 camera
 pans
 to


Trump
 and
 Trump
 is
 saying
 recounting
 a


story
 where
 a
 child
 who
 was
 this
 big


three-year-old
 beautiful
 child
 and
 they


came
 up
 to
 her
 with
 a
 needle
 this
 big


>> and
 they
 gave
 her
 the
 vaccine
 and
 she


got
 autism.
 Now
 science
 on
 one
 hand
 an


emotional
 story
 in
 the
 other.
 I
 know.


>> Tally,
 I
 think,
 said
 to
 me
 at
 the
 time,


she
 goes,
 "Even
 though
 I
 know
 it's
 not


true,
 there
 was
 part
 of
 me


>> that
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 scared."


>> I
 know.


>> So,
 my
 question
 here
 is
 how
 does
 how


does
 the
 Democratic
 Party
 win
 in
 such
 a


war
 when
 you're
 being
 fought
 with


emotion
 and
 fear?
 How
 do
 you
 win
 with


logic
 and
 rationality?
 like
 huh


>> I'll
 I'll
 answer
 your
 question
 directly


but
 I
 want
 to
 just
 add
 to
 the
 question


um
 that
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the
 question
 has


to
 be
 what
 is
 the
 responsible
 of
 media


what
 is
 the
 role
 of
 corporateowned
 media


um
 god
 bless
 independent
 media


because
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 also
 about
 what


set
 of
 information
 are
 people
 working


with
 you
 know
 for
 example
 I've
 talked
 to


a
 number
 of
 people
 who
 voted
 voted
 for


me.


Saying
 to
 them
 who
 are
 having
 debates,


disagreement,
 you
 know,
 ending


relationships
 with
 people
 who
 voted
 for


him.


And
 part
 of
 what
 I'm
 asking
 people
 to
 do


is
 not
 to
 assume
 that
 the
 people
 with


whom
 they
 disagree
 are
 working
 with
 the


same
 set
 of
 information.
 Now,
 I
 didn't


say
 facts
 because
 2
 plus
 2
 is
 four,


>> but


I
 think
 it's
 a
 big
 mistake
 for
 us
 to


assume
 we're
 all
 working
 with
 the
 same


information.


And
 then
 when
 you
 compound
 that
 with,


you
 know,
 intentional
 efforts
 to


misinform
 and
 disinform
 and
 targeted,
 I


I
 was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Senate


Intelligence
 Committee
 when
 we


investigated
 Russia's
 interference
 in


the
 2016
 election.


We
 declassified
 our
 findings.
 We
 made


them
 public.
 It
 included
 the
 fact
 that


this
 adversarial
 nation
 included
 in
 what


they
 targeted.
 They
 targeted
 black


voters


with
 the
 assumption
 that
 there
 are


certain
 people
 and
 demographically


certain
 groups
 who
 are
 more
 susceptible


to
 an
 argument
 about
 why
 they
 should


distrust
 their
 government
 because
 they


have
 a
 lived
 experience
 that
 tells
 them


that.
 And
 so
 I
 would
 say
 flippantly,
 oh,


so
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 issue
 of
 race


in
 America
 is
 a
 national
 security
 issue.


So
 everybody
 needs
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 We


know
 that
 certain
 demographics
 are


targeted
 with
 miss
 and
 disinformation.


Be
 they
 what
 we've
 seen
 around
 targeting


young
 voters
 or
 other
 groups
 based
 on


race
 or
 gender.


So
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 role
 of
 the


Democratic
 party,
 there
 is
 a
 very
 big


role
 to
 play
 and
 there
 is
 a
 role
 for
 us


to
 to
 to
 require
 social
 media
 companies


to
 play,
 media
 companies
 to
 play
 and
 so


on
 because
 information
 is
 coming
 from


all
 of
 these
 places
 and
 and
 the


challenge
 is
 as
 big
 as


do
 we
 are
 we
 all
 working
 with
 facts.


We
 have
 a
 team
 at
 my
 company,
 Flight


Story,
 called
 Flight
 X.
 And
 their


primary
 responsibility
 is
 innovating


across
 our
 business
 so
 that
 we
 can
 save


time,
 money,
 be
 better
 at
 what
 we
 do.


And
 one
 of
 the
 recent
 challenges
 I've


set
 to
 the
 team
 Flight
 X
 is
 to
 find
 ways


to
 save
 our
 company
 more
 time.
 And
 in


that
 conversation,
 Fiverr
 Pro,
 who
 a


sponsor
 of
 this
 podcast,
 came
 up.
 Fiverr


Pro,
 if
 you
 don't
 know,
 is
 like
 a


strategic
 lever
 we
 pull.
 It's
 a


marketplace
 of
 experts
 across
 750


different
 categories.
 every
 single
 one


of
 them
 handv
 vetted
 for
 quality
 and


they
 have
 enterprisegrade
 reliability.


And
 because
 I'm
 quite
 curious
 about


what's
 possible
 with
 something
 like


Fiverr
 Pro,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 one
 step


further
 and
 over
 the
 next
 few
 weeks,


we're
 running
 an
 experiment
 with
 Fiverr


Pro
 to
 see
 just
 how
 much
 time
 we
 can


save
 and
 how
 much
 we
 can
 unlock
 using


their
 talent
 to
 accelerate
 our
 business.


So,
 let's
 see
 how
 it
 goes.
 And
 in
 the


meantime,

 you're

A
 word
 you
 said
 there
 um
 piqued
 my


interest,
 which
 is
 the
 word
 independent


media.


>> Yes,


>> I
 am
 independent
 media.


>> Bless
 you.


>> And
 I'm
 in
 a
 group
 of
 my
 peers
 like
 the


big
 podcasters
 in
 the
 world
 like
 Joe


Rogan,
 etc.,
 and
 Alex
 Cooper.
 I
 know
 who


show
 you
 Anton
 um
 in
 as
 part
 of
 your


campaign.


>> The
 media
 landscape
 is
 changing
 before


our
 eyes


>> rapidly.


>> You're
 sat
 in
 a
 set
 now.
 You're
 the


madame
 vice
 vice
 president.
 You're
 sat


in
 effectively
 my
 kitchen,


>> my
 old
 kitchen
 where
 they
 started,
 you


know,


>> and
 that's
 crazy.
 Like
 20
 years
 ago,
 the


thought
 that
 you'd
 come
 to
 my
 kitchen
 is


such
 a
 crazy
 thing.
 But
 it's
 in
 part
 now


because
 of
 the
 democratization
 of
 these


platforms
 and
 creating
 the
 content
 is


much
 cheaper
 and
 we
 have
 distribution


now
 across
 these
 big
 platforms.


Many
 would
 say
 that
 it
 changed
 the


course
 of
 the
 election.
 Podcasting,


>> not
 just
 the
 podcast
 you
 did
 or
 didn't


go
 on,
 but
 just
 the
 conversations
 that


take
 place
 on
 these
 podcasts.
 And


>> as
 I
 have
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 as


podcasters,
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 same
 rigor


as
 traditional
 journalists,
 who
 I


respect
 a
 lot.
 We
 don't
 have
 the
 same


teams
 and
 real
 time
 fact,
 all
 those


kinds
 of
 things.


>> Podcasting,
 there
 was
 lots
 of


conversation
 around
 you
 going
 on
 Joe


Rogan's
 show
 or
 not
 going
 on,
 which


>> what
 is
 the
 what
 is
 the
 truth
 there
 for


anyone
 that
 hasn't
 yet
 read
 the
 book?
 Um


because
 Trump
 did
 like
 a
 hundred
 million


views
 on
 Joe
 Rogan's
 show
 and
 it
 in


three
 hours
 sat
 there
 getting
 to
 know


Trump
 and
 for
 better
 or
 for
 worse
 you


probably
 walked
 away
 from
 that


conversation
 feeling
 like
 you
 knew
 who


he
 was.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 do
 Joe
 Rogan
 show
 and
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 games
 being
 played
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 do
 Joe
 Rogan
 show.
 I
 think


podcasting
 is
 a
 very


powerful
 medium
 for
 people
 to
 get


information
 and
 and
 to
 your
 point
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 is
 a
 main
 source
 of


information
 and
 it's
 important
 for
 us
 to


support
 that.
 Joe
 Joe
 says
 you
 wanted
 he


want
 you
 want
 him
 to
 come
 to
 you
 which


is
 very
 un
 Joe
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 he


doesn't
 really
 travel
 in
 hindsight


do
 you
 wish
 you'd
 gone
 and
 done
 the
 show


for
 3
 hours
 at
 his
 studio
 in
 hindsight


it
 I'
 I'd
 mean
 really
 it
 just
 would
 be


what
 what
 were
 we
 giving
 up
 I
 wanted
 to


do
 his
 show
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 advised


me
 not
 to
 do
 his
 show
 because
 they


assumed
 as
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 correct


that
 he
 was
 supporting
 Trump
 and
 that
 it


would
 not
 be
 a
 productive
 piece
 for
 me.


But
 just
 like
 when
 I
 went
 on
 Fox
 News


with
 Brett
 Bear,
 my
 perspective
 was


they
 may
 have
 their
 bias,
 but
 there
 are


people
 that
 listen
 who
 are
 open-minded,


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 there
 and
 give
 them


a
 chance
 to
 get
 to
 know
 me
 and
 give
 me
 a


chance
 to
 make
 my
 case
 to
 them.


>> So,
 that
 was
 my
 perspective
 on
 Joe


Rogan,
 just
 like
 it
 was
 my
 perspective


on
 Fox.


>> There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 games
 being
 played


around
 the
 scheduling
 and
 it
 didn't


happen.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 don't
 have


anything
 against
 um
 certainly
 not


against
 the
 people
 who
 turn
 on
 to
 Joe


Rogan
 and
 would
 love
 to
 be
 able
 to
 talk


with
 him
 in
 a
 direct
 manner
 um
 as
 I


wanted
 to
 during
 the
 campaign.


>> Do
 you
 in
 hindsight
 wish
 you
 just
 put


your
 foot
 down
 and
 said,
 "I'm
 going to


go
 do
 it."


>> I
 don't
 know if
 it
 would
 have
 made
 a


difference,


but
 yeah.
 No,
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 it.
 So,
 let


me
 just
 say
 that,
 right?
 So,
 I
 wanted
 to


do
 it
 and
 it
 would
 have
 been
 great
 to
 do


and
 I
 think
 it
 would
 have
 been
 helpful


to
 do.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.
 So,
 it's
 just
 I
 mean


that
 the
 issue
 it
 was
 really
 about


what's
 the
 tradeoff
 in
 terms
 of
 votes


and
 where
 I
 spend
 my
 time.
 Do
 I
 spend
 my


time
 traveling
 for
 5
 hours
 and
 back


versus
 being
 for
 that
 period
 of
 time
 in


a
 swing
 state?


>> Mhm.


>> And
 that
 was
 the
 tradeoff.


>> I
 guess
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 point


>> it
 wasn't
 about
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 Joe


Rogan
 or
 it
 believe
 me
 at
 that
 point
 in


a
 campaign
 it's
 not
 about
 oh
 is
 somebody


coming
 to
 me
 or
 me
 going
 to
 them.
 I


could
 care
 less
 about
 that.
 Pride
 is
 not


associated
 with
 it.
 It
 is
 more
 about


>> it's
 it
 is
 literally
 about
 return
 on


investment.


>> Okay.
 And
 this
 goes
 to
 our
 point
 about


efficiency
 earlier.


>> Yeah.
 Exact
 exactly
 right.
 The
 only


there's
 only
 one
 candidate.


>> So
 where
 am
 I
 spending
 my
 time
 to
 get


the
 greatest
 return
 on
 the
 investment?


>> If
 I
 was
 in
 charge
 of
 your
 campaign


>> I
 would
 have
 100%


put
 you
 in
 that
 environment.
 Even
 when
 I


look
 at
 the
 trade-off
 in
 part
 because


someone
 like
 me
 and
 I
 consider
 myself
 to


be
 like
 genuinely
 really
 objective


>> and
 my
 friends
 know
 me
 as
 being
 extreme


not
 just
 objective
 on
 camera
 but


objective
 in
 my
 personal
 life.


>> I
 would
 have
 when
 you
 see
 a
 certain


environment
 present
 someone
 in
 a
 certain


way.


>> You
 really
 like
 the


>> the
 thing
 that
 can
 burst
 that
 bubble
 is


seeing
 that
 person
 go
 into
 that


environment.
 And
 like
 when
 I
 saw
 you
 on


Fox
 News,
 I
 watched
 that
 interview
 as


well.


>> Um


>> I
 actually
 think
 it
 strengthens


strengthens
 your
 supporters
 and
 actually


those
 independents
 who
 are
 in
 that
 space


too
 can
 can
 get
 a
 feel
 for
 you.
 So
 I


would
 have
 love
 to
 see
 and
 I
 actually


think


>> I
 hope
 in
 this
 next
 election
 cycle
 when


is
 it
 2028
 I
 really
 would
 love
 to
 see


>> both
 sides
 going
 to
 both
 sides
 and
 I


actually
 think
 that's
 happening
 now


going
 into
 those
 going
 into
 those


environments.
 I
 do
 also
 tend
 to
 think


that
 Joe
 would
 have
 been
 fair.


>> Mhm.


>> Well
 that's
 why
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 it.
 I
 had


to
 assume
 that
 that
 was
 possible


>> and
 either
 way
 he's
 very
 popular.
 I


would
 have
 loved
 to
 watch
 that.


>> I
 I
 regret
 that
 we
 didn't
 do
 it.
 I


definitely
 regret
 that
 we
 didn't
 do
 it.


And
 um


listen,
 I
 have


been
 doing
 my
 work
 long
 enough
 that


for
 me
 it
 has
 I've
 never
 had
 the
 luxury


of
 saying
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 into


uncomfortable
 situations.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 would
 need
 to
 have
 a
 different


profession.


PR
 people
 some
 some
 can
 sometimes
 [ __ ]


things
 up
 for
 for
 other
 people.
 I
 think


I
 think
 in
 the
 new
 world
 there's
 this


new
 requirement
 to
 be
 more
 like
 a
 glass


box
 and
 less
 like
 a
 black
 box.
 I
 think


>> in
 20
 years
 ago
 the
 whole
 strategy
 of


businesses
 and
 brands
 and
 CEOs


executives
 was
 to
 basically
 be
 black


boxes
 where
 the
 PR
 team
 paints
 the


perception
 on
 the
 outside
 and
 in
 this


digital
 world
 where
 it's
 like
 the
 media


and
 platforms
 are
 distributed
 and
 all
 of


my
 employees
 here
 have
 cameras
 on
 them


at
 all
 times.


The
 defense
 is
 like
 transparency
 because


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 let
 you
 craft
 my


narrative.
 You're
 going to
 see
 it.


>> That's
 why
 I
 wrote
 the
 book.


>> Exactly.


>> History
 is
 going
 to
 write
 about
 those


107
 days
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 let


>> that
 piece
 of
 American
 history
 be


written
 without
 my
 voice
 being
 present.


>> Are
 you
 going
 to
 run
 again?
 Cuz
 I
 look


at
 the
 polls.
 I
 looked
 at
 the
 polls
 and


you're
 leading
 for
 the
 Democratic
 side


and
 there
 isn't
 really
 a
 clear


Democratic


>> candidate.
 I
 I
 interviewed
 Gav
 Gavin


Newsome
 as
 well,
 but
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the


polls,
 you're
 still
 leading.


>> Yeah.
 You
 don't
 know.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Honestly,


>> I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 in
 your
 heart.


>> What
 do
 I
 know
 in
 my
 heart?


>> I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 you're


going
 to
 run
 in
 your
 heart
 or
 if
 you


have
 a
 calling
 or
 a
 feeling
 to
 is


something
 germinating.


>> I
 you
 know
 I'm
 focused
 on
 the
 book
 tour


sincerely.
 Yeah.
 And
 part
 of
 how
 I'm


feeling
 right
 now,
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I


didn't
 run
 for
 governor
 of
 California,
 I


really
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 transactional


right
 now.
 You
 know,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 present
 because
 I'm
 asking


for
 a
 vote.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 What's
 the
 case
 for
 running


again
 and
 what's
 the
 case
 for
 not


running
 again?


>> H
 I
 think
 the
 case
 for
 running
 again
 is


if
 I
 can
 make
 a
 difference.
 Honestly,
 if


I
 can
 make
 a
 difference,


you
 know,
 if
 I
 feel
 that
 I
 can
 offer


something
 as
 president
 of
 the
 United


States
 that
 would
 be


not
 only


uplifting
 to
 the
 American
 people,
 but


would
 be
 um


about,
 you
 know,
 getting
 us


on
 a
 correct
 trajectory.


>> Do
 you
 know what
 my
 next
 question
 is


going
 to
 be?
 What


>> do
 you
 believe
 that
 you
 can
 offer


something
 to
 the
 United
 States
 that's


going
 to
 be
 uplifting
 and
 get
 us
 on
 a


better
 trajectory?


>> I
 mean,
 that's
 why
 I
 ran
 the
 last
 time.


Um,


so
 28
 is
 is
 a
 far
 it's
 I
 mean
 it's


practically
 tomorrow,
 but
 it's
 it's
 not


and
 we'll
 have
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 over


the
 course
 of
 these
 next
 few
 months,


several
 months.


>> Is
 there
 a
 case
 against
 running
 again?


What
 would
 that
 be?


>> You
 know,
 it's
 difficult
 to
 run
 for


president.
 takes
 a
 toll
 on
 your
 family.


Takes
 a
 real
 toll
 on
 your
 family.
 You


know,
 anyone
 running
 for
 president


should
 really
 take
 very
 seriously
 the


decision
 cuz
 it
 is
 not
 for
 the
 faint
 of


heart.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 take
 a


punch
 and
 throw
 a
 punch,
 but
 you
 got
 to


be
 able
 to
 take
 a
 punch.


>> A
 lot
 of
 punches.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 something
 that
 comes
 with


success.
 whether
 you're
 running
 for


president
 of
 the
 United
 States,
 build
 a


successful
 business,
 have
 a
 public


profile,


um,
 which
 is
 among
 the
 the
 the
 difficult


aspects
 of
 it,
 and
 there
 are
 so
 many


positive
 aspects,
 but
 among
 the


difficult
 aspects
 is


putting
 yourself
 out
 there
 in
 a
 way
 that


you
 invariably


will
 be
 in
 a
 position
 hopefully
 Not
 with


a
 lot
 of
 people,


but
 where
 you
 will
 be
 misunderstood.


That's
 an
 awful
 feeling.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is.
 Yeah.


>> Oh,
 it's
 an
 awful
 feeling
 to
 be


misunderstood


in
 this
 environment
 in
 particular.


Invariably,
 you
 will
 put
 yourself
 in
 a


position
 where
 some
 people
 will
 hate


you.
 It's
 awful.


They
 don't
 know
 you,
 but
 they'll
 hate


you.


And


so
 to
 do
 anything
 that
 is
 about


distinguishing
 yourself


by
 virtue
 of
 the
 thing
 you
 can
 offer
 or


a
 differentiation
 from
 yourself
 and


others
 of
 you
 know
 in
 a
 similar
 category


it
 it
 exposes
 you
 to
 a
 lot.
 Um
 and
 so


you
 have
 to
 know
 why
 you're
 doing
 it.


And
 I
 believe
 that
 you
 have
 to
 do
 it
 for


something
 that
 is
 bigger
 than
 yourself,


not
 about
 your
 own
 power,
 not
 about
 your


ego,


not
 about
 your
 entitlement.
 It
 has
 to
 be


because
 to
 endure
 the
 the
 the
 the
 not


just
 the
 process
 of
 getting
 into
 the


job,
 but
 the
 job
 itself,


you
 got
 to
 be
 clear
 about
 why
 you're


there.
 on
 that
 night
 when
 you
 the


results
 come
 in
 and
 you
 realize
 that
 the


election
 hasn't
 gone
 your
 way
 and
 that


Trump
 is
 going
 to
 be
 elected.
 What
 would


I
 have
 seen
 if
 I
 was
 a
 fly
 on
 the
 wall


in
 the
 room?


>> I
 was
 in
 a
 state
 of
 shock.


>> Really?


>> Did
 you
 think
 the
 day
 before
 that
 you


were
 going
 to
 win?


>> Mhm.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 when
 did
 the
 the
 proverbial
 penny


drop?
 when
 I
 got
 a
 call
 from
 my
 campaign


manager


that
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 need
 200,000
 more


votes
 that
 we
 can't
 find.


Meaning,
 it's
 just
 the
 map,
 the
 numbers.


And


the
 thing
 I
 kept
 saying
 over
 and
 over


again,
 I
 was
 in
 a
 state
 of
 shock.
 I
 I


was


I
 was
 so
 inarticulate,


but
 maybe
 very
 articulate.
 What
 I
 kept


saying
 over
 and
 over
 again
 is,
 "My
 God,


my
 God,
 my
 God."


>> Really,


>> over
 and
 I
 couldn't
 stop.
 I


um
 I
 haven't
 felt
 that


emotion,
 anything
 similar
 to
 the
 emotion


I
 felt
 that
 day
 in
 for
 quite
 some
 time.


Um
 other
 than


the
 grief
 I
 felt
 when
 my
 mother
 died,


I
 fel
 I
 knew
 what
 was
 going
 to
 happen
 to


our
 country.


I
 knew
 I
 knew
 the
 harm
 that
 was
 going
 to


happen
 to
 people


and
 I
 I
 knew
 it.
 I
 knew
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen.
 You
 know,
 it's
 um


it's
 not
 like
 it's
 not
 about


winning


versus
 losing.
 It
 was
 never
 it
 was
 I


knew
 the
 consequence


of
 the
 outcome
 of
 that
 election
 and
 that


pained
 me.
 So


>> I
 can
 still
 see
 the
 pain
 in
 your
 face.


>> Oh,
 it's
 awful.


It's
 awful.
 You
 look
 at
 what's


happening.
 It's
 I
 mean


it
 it's
 awful
 what's
 right
 now.


The
 man
 is
 building
 a
 ballroom
 for
 a


bunch
 of
 his
 rich
 friends


while


millions
 and
 millions
 of
 people
 are


about
 to
 lose
 their
 health
 coverage
 in


terms
 of
 their
 being
 able
 to
 afford


premiums
 for
 their
 health
 care.


You
 look
 at
 the
 weaponization
 of
 the


Department
 of
 Justice


against
 political
 enemies.
 How
 titans
 of


industry
 are
 so
 afraid


that
 the
 capitulation
 that
 we're
 seeing


across
 the
 board,
 whether
 it
 be


universities,
 law
 firms,
 media


companies,


what's
 happening
 around
 gutting
 the


Department
 of
 Education,


lunch
 programs
 for
 for
 for
 lowincome


children.
 I
 IEPs,


individual
 education
 placement
 for
 for


special
 needs
 kids
 have
 I
 recently
 I'm


hearing
 the
 stories
 from
 mothers
 in


particular
 whose
 children
 have
 special


needs
 and
 they
 can't
 get
 an
 IEP.


These
 are
 babies,
 the
 children
 who
 are


most
 in
 need,
 their
 parents
 who
 are


struggling.


If
 you
 know
 a
 parent
 who
 has
 a
 special


needs
 child,
 what
 that
 means
 to
 their


life
 emotionally,
 physically,


financially,


and
 and
 we're
 not
 even
 giving
 them


assistance
 with
 their
 educational


program
 for
 their
 children.
 Meanwhile,


you're
 building
 a
 a
 gilded
 ballroom.


So,
 the
 harm,


it's
 extraordinary.


all
 those
 working
 people,
 the
 tariffs,


what
 this
 is
 meaning
 for
 people.
 He
 he


made
 a
 promise
 that
 on
 day
 one
 he
 was


going
 to
 bring
 down
 prices
 and


prices
 are
 higher
 for
 groceries.


Inflation
 is
 higher.
 Unemployment
 is


higher.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 Stephen,
 it
 must


be
 said
 the
 failure
 of
 the
 Democratic


party
 will
 be
 going
 forward


to
 overlook
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 bigger


than
 this
 one
 guy.


It
 is
 not
 just
 about
 this
 one
 person
 who


occupies
 the
 oval
 office.
 We
 are


witnessing
 what
 is
 the
 swift


implementation
 a
 high
 velocity
 event


that
 is
 the
 swift
 implementation
 of
 a


plan
 that
 has
 been
 decades
 in
 the


making.
 The
 strategy
 for
 dealing
 with


this
 moment
 has
 to
 include
 having
 some


historical
 perspective
 on
 how
 we
 got


here.
 That
 project
 2025
 didn't
 just
 fall


out
 of
 the
 sky.
 The
 idea
 of
 going
 after


public
 education,
 that's
 not
 new.
 the


Federalist
 Society,
 the
 Heritage


Foundation,


what's
 what
 the
 the
 gerrymandering
 of


districts,
 the
 the
 packing
 the
 court,


this
 stuff.
 This
 is
 about
 a
 an
 agenda


that
 is
 not
 going
 to
 begin
 and
 end
 with


one
 person.
 And


the
 destruction,
 it's
 profound.
 There


are
 there
 are
 however


a
 small
 group
 of
 people
 who
 have
 access


to
 the
 power
 and
 are
 close
 to
 the
 power


who
 are
 doing
 quite
 well.


the
 rest
 you
 look
 what
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 terms
 of
 working
 people


>> does
 the
 again
 as
 an
 objective
 observer


the
 democratic
 party
 needs
 to
 take


responsibility


for
 you
 know
 because
 the
 US
 operates
 as


this
 sort
 of
 two-party
 system
 where
 it's


kind
 of
 like
 this
 person
 versus
 this


person
 left
 versus
 right


>> right


>> the
 left
 lost
 they
 played
 it
 wrong
 from


the
 the
 Democratic
 perspective
 they're


paying
 the
 price
 of
 losing
 the
 game
 of


chess
 and
 so
 I
 think
 about
 the


Democratic
 party
 and
 you
 know
 They
 can


point
 at
 the
 the
 consequences
 of
 losing


that
 game,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 the


Democratic
 Party
 needs
 to
 get
 their
 [ __ ]


together
 so
 that
 they
 don't
 lose
 the


game
 again.


>> I
 agree.


>> And
 that's
 the
 personal
 responsibility


point,
 which
 is
 like
 how
 do
 how
 do
 you


stop
 yourself
 from
 finding
 yourself
 in
 a


situation
 where
 at
 the
 last
 minute
 Joe


Biden
 is
 pulled
 out
 with
 100
 days
 to
 go


and
 no
 one
 mentioned
 it.
 I
 mean,
 you
 say


in
 the
 book
 that
 you
 you
 you
 at
 the
 time


thought
 of
 it
 as
 grace.
 You
 talk
 about


this
 on
 page
 46.
 You
 say
 you
 thought
 it


was
 grace
 to
 not
 basically
 mention
 that


there
 was
 a
 problem
 and
 grace
 not
 to


tell
 Joe
 Biden
 to
 pull
 out
 earlier,


>> but
 actually
 in
 hindsight,
 you
 now
 think


it
 was
 probably
 reckless
 not
 to
 tell
 him


to
 pull
 out


>> on
 my
 part.
 Yeah.


>> So
 what
 what
 what
 is
 that
 to
 you?
 What


does
 the
 Democratic
 Party
 need
 to
 to
 do


to


>> First
 of
 all,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 had
 if
 I


had
 done
 it
 over


again,
 part
 of
 the
 reflection,


um,
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 the
 infrastructure


deal.
 We
 had
 the
 Chips
 Act,
 so
 we're


building
 back
 up
 America's


infrastructure.
 It's
 150
 years
 old.


Chips
 is
 about


manufacturing
 chips.
 um
 US
 manufacturing


both
 incredibly
 important.
 If
 I
 had
 to


do
 it
 over
 again,
 I
 would
 have
 first


gone
 with
 our
 family
 policy
 that
 was


about
 extension
 of
 the
 child
 tax
 credit,


affordable
 child
 care,
 paid
 family


leave.
 We
 needed
 to
 deal
 with
 the


immediate
 issues
 affecting
 the
 American


people.
 In
 fact,
 that's
 why
 I
 ran
 for


the
 107
 days
 on
 those
 issues,
 including


having
 Medicare
 cover,
 for
 example,
 for


people
 in
 the
 sandwich
 generation
 who


are
 taking
 care
 of
 young
 children
 and


older
 parents,
 Medicare
 cover
 home


health
 care,
 right?


>> Why
 I
 offered
 for
 small
 businesses
 that


they
 would
 get
 a
 $50,000
 tax
 credit


because
 nobody
 can
 for
 startup
 small


businesses
 because
 nobody
 can
 start
 up
 a


small
 business
 on
 a
 $5,000
 tax
 credit,


right?
 So


>> do
 you
 think
 the
 left
 is
 somewhat
 seen


as
 the
 enemy
 of
 entrepreneurship?


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 there
 is
 that


perception.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 is
 the


case
 in
 reality
 but
 I
 think
 we
 need
 we


have
 some
 work
 to
 do.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 talk
 about
 in
 the
 book


for
 example
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 mistake
 to


not
 invite
 Elon
 Musk
 when
 we
 had
 um
 and


I'm
 no
 fan
 of
 his
 but
 I
 admire
 his
 work


as
 an
 innovator


>> and
 um
 as
 as
 you
 know
 the
 what
 he
 has


done
 in
 terms
 of
 American
 manufacturing


of
 electric
 vehicles.
 We
 should
 have
 had


him
 at
 the
 White
 House
 when
 we
 had
 all


the
 other
 electric
 vehicle
 American


electric
 vehicle
 manufacturers.
 Right.


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 part
 of
 the
 problem.
 And


when
 I
 read
 that,
 I
 was
 really
 happy
 to


read
 that
 cuz
 you
 can
 disagree
 with


someone
 in
 part,
 but
 still
 have
 the


nuance
 to
 be
 able
 to
 acknowledge
 this


part's
 good,
 but
 if
 you
 just
 shut
 them


out
 because
 of
 one
 thing,
 then
 you


really
 drive
 the
 vision.


>> I
 mean,
 this
 gets
 back
 to
 my
 earlier


point
 about
 what's
 the
 motivation


>> for
 the
 decisions
 that
 a
 leader
 makes.


And


the
 motivation
 I
 has
 has
 to
 be
 what
 is


for
 the
 greater
 good


and
 and
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 put
 aside


you
 know
 those
 things
 that
 may
 may
 fall


in
 the
 context
 of
 being
 more
 personal.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 do
 a
 better
 job


of
 also
 focusing
 on
 being
 a
 bit
 more


bold.


For
 example,
 I
 think
 we
 should
 reduce


voting
 age
 to
 16.


I'll
 tell
 you
 why.


So,


Gen
 Z,


they're
 age
 about
 13
 through
 27.


They've
 only
 known
 the
 climate
 crisis.


They
 missed
 substantial
 parts
 of
 their


education
 because
 of
 the
 pandemic.


If
 they're
 in
 high
 school
 or
 college,


especially
 in
 college,
 it
 is
 very
 likely


that
 whatever
 they've
 chosen
 as
 their


major
 for
 study
 may
 not
 result
 in
 an


affordable
 wage.


They've
 coined
 the
 term
 climate
 anxiety


to
 describe
 fear
 of
 not
 only
 being
 able


to
 buy
 a
 home,
 but
 that
 fear
 it'll
 be


wiped
 out
 by
 extreme
 weather,
 but
 fear


of
 having
 children.


Um,
 it
 is
 expected
 that
 Gen
 Z
 will
 have


10
 to
 12
 jobs
 in
 their
 lifetime.
 They


are
 a
 larger
 number
 than
 boomers.


There
 are
 specific
 generation
 of
 people


who
 are
 going
 to
 impact
 our
 nation
 and


the
 world.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 must
 invest
 in


them.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 they
 are
 rightly


impatient
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 is
 the


tradition
 of
 leadership
 right
 now.
 And


if
 they
 were
 able
 to
 vote
 because
 they


know
 everything
 that's
 happening
 right


now
 is
 going
 to
 impact
 them
 more
 than


anybody
 older
 than
 them
 for
 the
 most


part
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 these
 systems
 work.


If
 they're
 voting
 right
 now
 at
 16
 and


up,
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about


the
 importance
 of
 climate.
 They're
 going


to
 be
 talking
 about
 the
 importance
 of


figuring
 out
 how
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 affect


the
 future
 of
 the
 workforce.
 They're


going
 to
 be
 focused
 on
 what
 are
 we


really
 doing
 about
 affordable
 housing.


And
 basically
 in
 politics,
 here's
 the


the
 hard
 truth
 about
 this.
 There
 are
 two


centers
 of
 power
 that
 tend
 to
 influence


how
 politicians
 think.
 Groups
 that
 vote


the
 most
 and
 people
 who
 write
 the
 most


checks.


And
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 every
 day
 with
 the


people
 the
 people
 and
 and
 thinking
 about


how
 do
 we
 strengthen
 people
 actually


going
 to
 the
 polls
 and
 voting.
 Back
 to


my
 point
 in
 2024
 one-third
 of
 the


electorate
 didn't
 vote.
 Let's
 focus
 on


why
 and
 are
 we
 talking
 with
 them?
 Are
 we


offering
 them
 bold
 solutions?


Are
 we
 bringing
 ideas
 forward
 that
 are


speaking
 to
 their
 immediate
 needs?


Are
 we
 are
 we
 doing
 it
 in
 an
 effective


way?
 Back
 to
 your
 point
 about
 podcast


and
 other
 mediums.


>> If
 you
 run
 again,
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 go


into
 those
 more
 rightle
 leaning


environments,
 media
 environments?
 Would


you
 go
 on,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 saying


Joe's
 rightwing,
 but
 would
 you
 go
 on


Joe's
 show?


>> I
 would
 certainly
 I
 would
 go
 at
 Joe's


show
 if
 I'm
 not
 running.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 to


say.


>> Do
 you
 know
 when
 you'll
 make
 a
 decision?


Like
 what's
 the
 time
 frame
 for
 someone?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


obviously
 at
 some
 point
 we'll
 need
 to


make
 the
 decision.
 I
 haven't
 thought


about
 the
 timeline.
 Probably
 in
 the
 next


year.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 what
 is
 it?
 November


of
 28.
 Primaries
 would
 be
 in
 June.


>> And
 since
 that
 day
 when
 Trump
 won
 the


election
 and
 you
 were
 sat
 there
 saying,


"Oh
 god,
 oh
 god,
 under
 your
 breath."
 How


has
 the
 balance
 of
 that
 decision
 shifted


over
 time?
 Has
 the
 conviction
 grown
 from


that
 moment?
 Like
 in
 that,
 if
 I
 had


asked
 you
 in
 that
 moment
 when
 you
 were


saying,
 "Oh
 god,
 oh
 god,
 under
 your


breath."
 Would
 you
 have
 said
 never


again?


And
 today
 are
 you
 more
 on
 the
 side
 of


potentially?


>> That's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 think


well
 I
 could
 start
 with
 this.
 I
 think
 my


family
 would
 have
 said
 never
 again.
 I


think
 that
 as
 time
 has
 gone
 by.
 Um
 and


people
 have
 had
 a
 chance
 including


myself
 to
 kind
 of


sit
 with
 it,
 reflect
 on
 it.
 Writing
 the


book
 was
 very
 cathartic.
 Um
 being
 away


from
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 space
 and
 time.
 It


it
 has
 a
 way
 of
 mitigating
 the
 pain
 of


what
 that
 process
 was.


>> Just
 like
 grief.


>> Yeah.


>> Use
 the
 word
 grief
 to
 describe
 that


feeling.
 So


>> you
 get
 to
 acceptance
 at
 some
 point
 and


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 really
 good
 point.
 Yeah,


you're
 right.
 That's
 right.
 And
 you
 get


to
 process
 it


>> in
 a
 way
 that
 also
 is
 about
 what's
 my


role
 to
 play


and
 what
 could
 I
 have
 done
 differently


as
 a
 way
 to
 help
 guide
 future
 decisions,


whatever
 that
 be.
 I've
 built
 companies


from
 scratch
 and
 backed
 many
 more.
 And


there's
 a
 blind
 spot
 that
 I
 keep
 seeing


in
 early
 stage
 founders.
 They
 spend
 very


little
 time
 thinking
 about
 HR.
 And
 it's


not
 because
 they're
 reckless
 or
 they


don't
 care.
 It's
 because
 they're


obsessed
 with
 building
 their
 companies.


And
 I
 can't
 fault
 them
 for
 that.
 At
 that


stage,
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the


product.
 How
 to
 attract
 new
 customers,


how
 to
 grow
 your
 team,
 really,
 how
 to


survive.
 And
 HR
 slips
 down
 the
 list


because
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 urgent,
 but


sooner
 or
 later
 it
 is.
 And
 when
 things


get
 messy,
 tools
 like
 our
 sponsor
 today,


Just
 Works,
 go
 from
 being
 a
 nice
 to
 have


to
 being
 a
 necessity.
 Something
 goes


sideways
 and
 you
 find
 yourself
 having


conversations
 you
 did
 not
 see
 coming.


This
 is
 when
 you
 learn
 that
 HR
 really
 is


the
 infrastructure
 of
 your
 company.
 And


without
 it,
 things
 wobble.
 And
 Just
 Work


stops
 you
 learning
 this
 the
 hard
 way.
 It


takes
 care
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 would


otherwise
 drain
 your
 energy
 and
 your


time,
 automating
 payroll,
 health


insurance,
 benefits,
 and
 it
 gives
 your


team
 human
 support
 at
 any
 hour.
 It
 grows


with
 your
 small
 business
 from
 startup


through
 to
 growth,
 even
 when
 you
 start


hiring
 team
 members
 abroad.
 So,
 if
 you


want
 HR
 support
 that's
 there
 through
 the


exciting
 times
 and
 the
 challenging


times,
 head
 to
 justworks.com
 now.
 That's

>> Right
 guys,
 going
 to
 go
 get
 Steve.
 The


guest
 is
 here.
 Ready?


>> Come
 in.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Steve,
 what


>> what
 are
 you
 doing?


>> This
 is
 uh
 the
 Bontage
 face
 mask.
 It's


good
 for
 blemishes,
 wrinkles,
 uh
 clears


up
 the
 skin.
 It's
 red
 light.
 Have
 you


not
 used
 it
 before?


>> No.


>> I
 tried
 this
 before.
 It's
 um
 it's
 really


really
 good.
 It
 shines
 red
 light
 on
 your


face
 which
 helps
 increase
 and
 boost


collagen
 production.
 Actually
 found
 it


out
 cuz
 of
 the
 misses.
 Seen
 her
 wearing


it.
 She
 terrified
 me
 a
 couple
 of
 nights


in
 a
 row.
 Um
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 to
 scare


people
 with
 but
 actually
 it's
 really


really
 good
 for
 your
 skin.
 So
 they
 are
 a


sponsor
 of
 the
 podcast
 and
 uh
 I've
 been


using
 it
 every
 day
 for
 about
 a
 year
 and


a
 half
 now.


>> Wow.


>> Well,
 Steve
 is
 great.


>> Yes.

 You
 talked
 about
 being


bold.
 Is
 that
 also
 in
 communication?
 Cuz


as
 I've
 seen
 you
 on
 this
 book
 tour,
 it


seems
 your
 communication
 has
 become


increasingly
 more
 bold.
 I've
 seen
 you


get
 up
 a
 couple
 of
 times
 and
 start


shouting
 a
 little
 bit
 at
 certain
 things


that
 pissed
 you
 off
 and
 being
 a
 bit
 more


unfiltered.
 And
 I
 think
 funnily
 I
 think


polish
 is
 actually


>> uh
 detrimental.


>> That's
 what
 I
 love
 about
 podcasting.


It's
 so
 unpolished.
 Like
 I
 sit
 here
 in


my
 [ __ ]
 socks
 and
 it
 can
 it
 just


there's
 no
 your
 team's
 pretense.
 There's


no
 pretense.
 There's
 nothing
 you
 said
 I


couldn't
 ask
 you
 at
 all.
 Right.
 I
 was


wondering
 if
 that's


>> you've
 noticed
 that
 in
 yourself
 and
 if


that's
 you
 think
 that's
 important.


Right.
 Like,
 am
 I
 just
 like,
 "Fuck
 it."


>> Yeah,
 exactly.


>> Don't
 ask
 the
 question
 with
 pretense.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 That's
 exactly
 what
 I


mean.
 Are
 you
 just
 like, "Fuck
 it,
 now


it
 doesn't
 matter."
 Cuz
 the
 book
 had


[ __ ]
 energy.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 that
 energy
 in


the
 book.
 But
 just
 like
 here,
 but
 here's


part
 of
 it
 that
 I
 um
 in
 writing
 it
 and


now
 this
 is
 how
 I
 feel
 about
 it.


In
 so
 many
 ways,
 I've
 been
 in
 the
 belly


of
 the
 beast


and


I
 I
 feel
 that
 the
 consequence


of
 an
 election
 for
 president
 of
 the


United
 States
 impacts
 billions
 of
 people


around
 the
 world.


And
 yet
 the
 process
 can
 be
 so
 opaque.


And
 what
 I
 also
 hope
 to
 do
 with
 the
 book


is
 just
 lift
 up
 the
 hood
 on
 it
 so
 people


could
 see
 how
 it
 runs


and
 in
 a
 way
 that
 if
 it's
 for
 a


journalist,
 if
 it's
 for
 a
 high
 school


student,
 if
 it's
 for
 someone's


grandmother


to
 confirm
 or
 enlighten
 around
 what


people
 think
 it
 is
 in
 a
 way
 that
 they


can
 see
 themselves
 in
 their
 own
 power,


you
 know,


>> and
 that
 does
 require
 um
 demystifying
 it


and
 I
 guess
 part
 of
 demystifying
 is
 yeah


like
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 oh
 this


kind
 of
 thing
 should
 not
 be
 talked


about.


>> Do
 you
 regret
 running
 with
 only
 107
 days


notice?
 Do
 you
 wish
 you
 hadn't
 ran?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 regret
 running.
 I
 wish
 we


had
 more
 time.
 I
 truly
 wish
 we
 had
 more


time.
 I
 truly
 wish
 we
 had
 more
 time.
 I


don't
 regret
 running.


>> Had
 you
 known
 the
 outcome,
 would
 you


have
 still
 ran?


probably


because


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 happened


and
 to
 this
 day


men
 and
 women,
 girls
 and
 boys
 come
 up
 to


me
 and
 say
 there
 was
 something
 about


that
 campaign
 that
 excited
 something
 in


them.
 I
 can't
 tell
 you
 the
 number
 of


people
 who
 have
 come
 up
 to
 me
 and
 said,


"I
 decided
 to
 run
 for
 office
 because
 you


ran."


The
 number
 of
 people
 who
 have
 come
 up
 to


me
 and
 said,
 "I
 decided
 to
 go
 to
 law


school
 because
 you
 inspired
 me
 with
 what


I
 The
 number
 of
 people
 who
 have
 told
 me


about
 their
 young
 children


who,
 you
 know,
 saw
 something
 and
 got


excited
 about
 it
 and
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 part


of
 it.
 I
 don't
 regret
 any
 of
 that.
 I
 I
 I


absolutely
 believe
 that
 we
 turned


something
 on."


In
 fact,
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 this


differently
 because
 it's
 not
 like
 people


didn't
 have
 it
 in
 them.
 They
 had
 it
 in


them,
 but
 there
 was
 something
 that
 those


107
 days
 did
 to
 welcome,
 to
 invite,
 to


grow
 the
 optimism
 and
 dare
 I
 say
 the
 joy


that
 people
 do
 carry
 with
 them.
 And
 what


I
 hope
 to
 do
 with
 my
 voice
 right
 now
 is


to
 remind
 everyone,


please
 don't
 let
 your
 spirit
 be


defeated.
 We
 may
 not
 have
 won
 the


election,
 but
 our
 spirit
 can't
 be


defeated
 because
 then
 they
 really
 win.


And
 sometimes
 the
 fight
 takes
 a
 while,


right?
 So,
 I
 don't
 regret
 having
 run


in
 spite
 of
 the
 outcome.
 Um,


but
 I
 do
 regret
 that
 we
 did
 not
 have


more
 time.


>> You
 mean
 you've
 got
 more
 time
 now?


>> Yeah.
 Time
 to
 do
 a
 podcast.


>> Time
 to
 run
 for
 president
 as
 well,


potentially.
 go
 out.


>> I
 um
 I
 look
 at
 I've
 got
 two
 pictures


here
 which
 I
 thought
 are
 beautifully


sweet.
 I'll
 show
 you
 both
 of
 them,
 but


>> Okay.


>> I
 um
 Yeah,
 these
 these
 two
 pictures
 here


of
 dog.


>> Oh,
 my
 doggy.
 Yeah.


>> How
 you
 know
 when
 if
 I
 was
 in
 a


situation
 where
 the
 election
 results
 had


come
 in
 and
 I'
 had
 that
 call
 from
 my
 my


team
 saying
 that
 there's
 200,000
 votes


we
 can't
 find.


>> I
 think
 I'd
 probably
 be
 turning
 to
 my
 my


partner
 in
 those
 moments.


>> Oh,
 I
 definitely
 did.
 Talk
 to
 me
 about


that.
 What's
 What
 role
 did
 he
 play?


>> I
 mean,
 he
 is
 It
 sounds
 so
 corny,
 but
 he


truly
 is
 my
 rock.
 He
 is
 um


My
 husband
 is
 just
 fully


self-actualized.


He's
 not
 pretending
 to
 be
 anything
 he's


not.
 He
 is
 a
 strong
 man
 who
 cares
 about


his
 family,
 cares
 about
 hard
 work.
 He
 is


loyal.
 He
 has
 a
 sense
 of
 humor.
 He's


very
 encouraging.


He's
 very
 honest.


And
 you
 know
 I
 want
 that
 for
 anyone
 and


everyone.
 I
 know
 you
 talk
 with
 a
 lot
 of


people
 and
 you
 know
 about
 advice
 about


career
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 for
 any
 of
 us.


What
 I
 want
 for
 anyone
 who
 has
 ambition


for
 success


have
 in
 your
 life
 and
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 but
 that
 circle
 of


people
 who
 have
 some
 understanding
 of


what
 you're
 going
 through


and
 are
 there
 when
 you
 want
 to
 laugh
 at


the
 thing
 you're
 not
 supposed
 to
 laugh


about.


You
 want
 to
 use
 the
 words
 you
 don't
 use


wherever
 you
 pray.


Um
 the
 people
 who
 you
 know
 I
 talk
 about


you
 know
 if
 you
 if
 you
 slip
 and
 fall


they'll
 laugh
 at
 you
 and
 then
 pick
 you


up
 and
 push
 you
 back
 out
 there.
 None
 of


us
 has
 achieved
 success
 without
 those


people
 in
 our
 lives.
 And
 it
 might
 be


your
 spouse.
 It
 might
 be
 your
 partner.


It
 might
 be
 a
 family
 member.
 It
 it
 could


be
 anybody.
 But
 but
 be
 intentional
 about


having
 those
 people
 in
 your
 life
 because


look,
 this
 is
 life.
 There,
 you
 know,
 so


cliche,
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 the
 ups,


they're
 going to
 be
 the
 downs.
 It's
 it's


the


it's
 the
 beauty
 of
 living
 that,
 you


know,
 it
 it
 involves
 the
 whole
 spectrum,


but
 when
 you
 have
 people
 that
 can
 be


with
 you
 on
 your
 journey,


it
 just
 makes
 it
 better.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 what
 he
 said
 to
 you
 that


night?


Well,
 he
 was
 in
 as
 much
 of
 a
 state
 of


shock
 as
 I
 was.


We
 didn't
 I
 have
 to
 admit,
 we
 were
 not


very
 articulate
 that
 night.


>> How
 long
 did
 that
 last?


>> Well,


not
 until
 I
 started
 writing
 the
 book


and
 getting
 to
 the
 chapter
 on
 election


night.
 Do
 you
 know
 that
 was
 the
 first


time
 Doug
 and
 I
 talked
 about
 election


night?


>> Really?
 How
 how
 many
 weeks
 months
 was


that?


>> Months.


We
 had
 never
 talked
 about
 election


night.
 Never.
 Had
 never
 talked
 about


election
 night.
 It
 was
 when
 I
 was


writing
 the
 book.
 That's
 when
 he
 told
 me


something
 I
 had
 no
 idea,
 which
 is
 he
 and


my
 brother-in-law
 had
 been
 campaigning


on
 election
 day
 in
 Michigan.
 All
 felt


good.
 I
 remember
 talking
 to
 him
 and
 he


said,
 "It
 feels
 good
 out
 here.


Everybody's
 saying
 it
 feels
 good."


Then
 on
 their
 way
 back
 to
 DC,


they
 got
 a
 call
 from
 a
 friend
 of
 ours


who
 was
 a
 Democrat
 who
 but
 who
 was
 a
 a


pundit
 on
 Fox
 News
 and
 he
 was
 in
 their


boiler
 room,
 their
 war
 room.
 And
 he


calls
 Doug
 and
 my
 brother-in-law
 Tony
 to


say,
 "What
 are
 you
 guys
 hearing?
 Cuz


what
 I'm
 hearing
 concerns
 me."


I
 didn't
 know
 that
 happened.


All
 I
 knew
 was
 Doug
 went
 campaigning


with
 Tony.
 I
 was
 campaigning.
 Everybody


was
 campaigning.
 I
 had
 a
 house
 full
 of


family.
 When
 he
 came
 back
 to
 the
 house,


I
 knew
 something
 was
 like
 a
 little
 off


in
 retrospect.


What
 I
 didn't
 know
 is
 he
 had
 that


information.


And
 he
 had
 gone
 up
 the
 stairs
 to
 take
 a


shower
 and
 pray.


And


I
 didn't
 know
 until
 we
 talked
 about
 that


chapter
 because
 we
 talked
 about
 that


night.
 And
 then
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 him


about


we
 always
 do
 friends
 and
 family
 dinner


and
 I
 said,
 "Doug,
 remember
 the
 tables


and
 do
 you
 remember
 who
 was
 sitting
 at


our
 table?"
 And
 then
 and
 he
 said
 I
 said,


"Remember
 when
 I
 gave
 the
 toast?"
 He


said, "You
 didn't
 give
 the
 toast.
 You


didn't
 give
 a
 toast."


I
 said,
 "I
 did."
 He
 said, "No,
 you're


thinking
 about
 one
 of
 the
 other
 events


cuz
 we
 used
 to
 do
 dinners
 in
 that
 room."


No,
 it
 was
 our
 friends
 and
 family


dinner.
 I
 gave
 a
 toast.
 So,
 I
 looked
 for


the
 photographs
 of
 that
 night
 and
 I


found
 one
 and
 there
 I
 am
 standing
 giving


a
 toast.


Doug
 was
 so
 in
 his
 head
 at
 that
 point


worried


about
 what
 he
 heard
 from
 our
 friend


about
 what
 Fox
 News
 was
 reporting


in
 their
 boiler
 room.
 He
 didn't
 really


experience
 any
 of
 that.
 You
 know,
 have


you
 ever
 had
 those?
 Yeah.


>> But
 you've
 just
 like
 something
 is
 so


weighing
 on
 that
 you're
 not
 experiencing


anything
 that
 cuz
 that's
 all
 you're


thinking.
 M.


>> But
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 tell
 me
 that


night.
 He
 prayed
 it
 would
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 different.


>> In
 hindsight,
 could
 you
 tell
 that


something
 was
 off
 with
 him?


>> In
 hindsight,
 I
 could
 tell.


>> And
 I
 um


and
 yeah,
 and
 we
 never,


you
 know,
 cuz
 we
 we
 had
 to
 function.


We
 had
 a
 house
 full
 of
 people,
 family.


the
 next
 day


cuz
 we
 were
 going
 to
 go
 to
 Howard


University's
 campus,
 my
 alma
 mater,
 to


give
 a
 victory
 speech
 the
 night
 of
 the


election,


um
 told
 everybody
 to
 come
 back
 the
 next


day.
 And
 so
 then
 I
 had
 to
 get
 ready
 to


go
 and
 give
 a
 speech,
 which
 was
 a


concession
 speech.
 And
 actually
 to
 the


point
 of,
 you
 know,
 I
 had
 to
 reconcile,


I
 would
 close
 every
 rally
 by
 saying,


"When
 we
 fight,
 we
 win.


And
 it
 was
 not
 as
 simplistic
 as
 well,


you
 win
 some,
 you
 lose
 some.
 And
 I
 was


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 I,


especially
 for
 all
 those
 young
 people,


how
 do
 I
 help
 them
 reconcile
 that?
 And


on
 the
 way
 to
 the
 giving
 the
 speech,
 I


wrote
 into
 the
 speech,
 well,
 sometimes


the
 fight
 takes
 a
 while.
 But
 when
 I
 got


So
 when
 we
 got
 to
 the
 when
 we
 got
 to


Howard,
 we
 were
 in
 the,
 you
 know,
 green


room
 and
 our
 family
 was
 there.
 So
 this


is
 how
 awful
 I
 am.
 I'm
 looking,


everybody's
 crying.
 And
 I
 just
 looked
 at


them.
 I
 said,
 "We
 are
 not
 having
 a
 pity


party.


We
 are
 not
 having
 a
 pity
 party."
 And
 I


was
 just
 on


function,


you
 know,
 and
 then
 it
 was
 um


and
 then
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 I
 had
 the


we
 we
 ended
 up
 we
 had
 a
 a
 trip
 planned


to
 Hawaii
 for
 vacation.


from
 many
 many
 months
 ago
 and
 there
 was


a
 emergency
 happening
 in
 the
 world
 and


so
 I
 couldn't
 go
 and
 we
 couldn't
 go
 and


we
 forgot
 that
 we
 actually
 cuz
 we
 had


paid
 to
 rent
 this
 house
 and
 my
 team


being
 so
 great
 they're
 like
 why
 don't
 we


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 you
 to
 go
 to
 that


house
 now


>> Mhm.
 And
 as
 I
 reflected
 on
 it,
 it
 was


literally,
 it
 wasn't
 a
 vacation.
 It
 was


like
 the
 oxygen
 mask
 just
 dropped
 and
 we


put
 it
 on
 and
 went
 to
 Hawaii
 and


some
 friends
 of
 ours
 met
 us
 there
 and
 we


were
 like
 zombies,
 you
 know,
 for
 a


while.
 It
 was
 just
 it
 was
 we
 it
 was
 a


very
 difficult
 thing
 to
 process.


>> Is
 that
 depression?


>> Um,
 probably.
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's


there
 is
 the
 thing
 about
 one
 um


about
 you
 know
 going
 going
 going
 going


and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


so
 there
 is
 that
 which
 is
 just
 your
 body


is
 physically
 used
 to
 this
 thing
 that


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 stops
 and
 I've
 had
 that


happen
 every
 time
 I've
 run
 and
 win
 even


right


>> like
 what
 it
 gold
 medal
 depression


>> right
 right


>> when
 you
 win
 the
 gold
 medal
 people
 get


depressed
 because


>> yeah
 because
 you
 because
 you've
 been


you've
 been
 functioning
 the
 whole
 time


in
 a
 very
 competitive
 nature
 and
 it's


fight
 or
 flight
 and
 it's
 adrenaline


adrenaline
 adren
 surging
 surging
 surging


and
 then
 there
 is
 the
 piece
 that
 is


about


I
 mean
 it
 it
 lasted
 for
 days
 which
 is


almost
 that
 you
 know
 they
 talk
 about


when
 people
 um


lose
 a
 limb
 there's
 the
 like
 the
 ghost


or
 the
 phantom


>> phantom
 limb
 yeah


>> right
 the
 phantom
 limb
 them
 and
 I
 had
 a


hard
 time
 reconciling.
 We
 can't
 still
 do


something
 about
 it.


I
 had
 a
 just
 I
 I
 knew
 it's
 just
 like
 I


knew
 I
 was
 going
 through
 the
 stages
 of


grief.
 I
 knew,
 you
 know,
 so
 that's
 good


to
 be
 able
 to
 put
 a
 label
 on
 something,


but
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 don't


otherwise
 experience
 it.


>> You
 weren't
 helpless
 at
 that
 point.


Yeah.


>> I
 wasn't
 I
 was
 just
 like
 there's


something
 there
 must
 be
 something
 I
 can


do.
 Do
 you
 reflect
 on
 um
 I
 know
 your


your
 mother
 passed
 away
 when
 in
 your


early
 you
 were
 in
 your
 early
 40s.
 I


think
 she
 was
 70
 years
 old
 roughly
 and


she
 was
 colon
 cancer


her
 birthday
 was
 December
 7th.
 She
 died


February
 11th.
 She
 was
 just
 2
 months


into
 being
 70.


>> Is
 her
 spirit
 and
 her
 her
 presence
 still


with
 you
 in
 these
 moments?
 And
 do
 you


reflect
 on
 what
 she
 had
 be
 thinking
 of


all
 this?


>> Very
 much.
 Very
 much
 all
 the
 time.


Um,


she
 I
 mean
 I
 can't


if
 my
 I
 you
 know
 it's
 funny
 I've
 talked


to
 a
 couple
 people
 who
 have
 lost
 their


parents
 who


were


who've
 lost
 them
 recently
 but
 whose


parents
 had
 a
 similar
 nature
 to
 my


mother.
 And
 one
 of
 them
 said
 to
 me
 most


recently,
 she
 said,
 "I'm
 so
 glad
 my


father
 is
 not
 alive
 to
 see
 this
 because


it
 would
 kill
 him."


I
 was
 just
 talking
 to
 somebody
 recently


who
 just
 said
 that.
 Um,
 oh,
 my
 mother


would
 be
 I'd
 pro,
 you
 know,
 it
 would
 be


a
 great
 distraction
 for
 me
 if
 my
 mother


were
 alive
 right
 now
 because
 I'd
 have
 to


spend
 full
 time
 talking
 her
 down.


would
 be,


oh,
 you
 know,
 when
 I
 talked
 about
 that


safe
 space,


>> so
 early
 on
 when
 I
 was
 running
 for
 DA,


this
 is
 when
 I
 realized
 I
 need
 to
 have


like
 that
 core
 group
 of
 like
 that
 safe


space.
 And
 I
 thought
 my
 mother
 would
 be


a
 perfect
 person
 to
 be
 in
 it.


And
 I
 realized
 that
 was
 a
 huge
 mistake


on
 my
 part
 because
 my
 mother
 wanted
 to


kill
 everybody


and
 then
 I'd
 have
 to
 spend
 full
 time


talking
 her
 down
 instead
 of
 dealing
 with


how
 I
 needed
 to
 address
 a
 situation.


So
 that's
 my
 mother's
 nature.
 We
 used
 to


call
 her
 mommy.
 That's
 mommy's
 nature.


>> She'd
 be
 so
 proud.


>> Oh,
 she
 would
 be
 proud.
 She'd
 be
 very


proud.
 She
 um
 Oh
 my
 god.
 So,
 she
 passed


just
 before
 my
 election
 as
 attorney


general


and
 I
 was
 I
 took
 care
 of
 her
 when
 she


was
 sick
 and
 we
 were
 um
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 days
 and
 there
 were
 weeks
 where


she
 needed
 to
 be
 in
 the
 hospital
 and
 so


she
 was
 I
 was
 with
 her
 in
 the
 hospital.


She's
 in
 the
 bed
 and
 I
 was
 in
 the
 chair


sitting
 next
 to
 her
 and
 so
 like
 I'm
 here


and
 she's
 here
 and
 she
 was
 just
 kind
 of


resting


and
 she
 said
 to
 me,
 "How's
 the
 campaign


going?"


And
 she's
 and
 I'm
 sitting
 here.
 I
 said,


"Well,
 mommy,


this
 is
 truth."
 I
 said, "Well,
 mommy,


they
 said
 they're
 going
 to
 kick
 my
 ass."


My
 mother
 turned
 over
 and
 looked
 at
 me


and
 smiled.


Swear
 to
 God.


>> She
 didn't
 say
 anything.


>> She
 smiled
 like,
 "Yeah,
 let
 them
 try."


Uh-huh.
 That
 was
 my
 mother.


Yeah.


>> You
 miss
 her?


>> Oh,
 all
 the
 time.
 Yeah.


All
 the
 time.
 But,
 you
 know,
 it's
 um


here's
 the
 thing
 about
 life.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've
 learned
 um


you
 know
 it's
 just
 like
 having


the
 things
 that
 can
 be
 it's
 the
 duality.


The
 things
 that
 can
 be
 a
 great
 blessing


and


have
 a
 huge
 impact.
 When
 it's
 not
 there


it
 feels
 like
 a
 huge
 loss.


It's
 like
 you
 asked
 earlier
 would
 you


have
 done
 it
 differently
 then?
 Would
 we


ever
 say
 because
 we've
 experienced
 the


loss
 of
 someone
 we
 love
 that
 we
 would


not
 have
 loved?
 Never.
 Right.
 Never.


Yeah.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Um
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 We
 do
 have
 a
 closing


tradition,
 but
 I
 think
 we're
 out
 of


time.


>> Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 anyway.
 [ __ ]
 it.


Okay.


>> Um
 the
 closing
 tradition
 is
 the
 last


guest
 leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the
 next


guest,
 not
 knowing
 who
 they're
 leaving


it
 for.
 And
 the
 question
 left
 for
 you
 is


if
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 in
 the
 last
 10


years
 you
 would
 do
 differently,
 what


would
 it
 be
 and
 why?


>> Oh,


>> I
 mean
 this
 is
 quite


the
 whole
 interview.
 I
 wrote
 read
 my


book.


>> Okay,
 we'll
 leave
 it
 at
 that.
 Read
 the


book
 107
 days.
 um
 Kla
 Harris.
 It's
 an


incredible
 book
 because
 it's
 so


unbelievably
 honest
 and
 it's
 so


unbelievably
 human
 and
 it
 lets
 you
 see


behind
 a
 curtain
 one
 does
 not
 usually


get
 to
 see
 behind
 which
 is
 extremely


extremely
 rare
 but
 extremely


illuminating
 and
 valuable.
 Um
 your


career
 is
 one
 that
 has
 inspired
 me


tremendously
 because
 you've
 broken
 down


walls,
 broken
 through
 ceilings
 and


continue
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 if
 anyone
 takes


the
 time
 to
 read
 your
 book
 or
 look


through
 the
 story
 of
 your
 life,
 it
 is


irrefutable
 that
 your
 agenda
 is
 to
 to


serve
 people.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


giving
 me
 your
 time
 today.


>> Thank
 you.
 I'm
 very
 very
 touched
 by


that.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
