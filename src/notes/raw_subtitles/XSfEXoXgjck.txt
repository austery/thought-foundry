What do we need to know about the
numbers in Jp morgan's business?
Because, as Matt says, sometimes the
headlines look darn good and the quarter
was darn good.
It's just that I think there are some
bullish investors out there that wanted
more.
And if you did, you know, so on today
they're underperforming.
But if you look at year to date, if you
look at their valuation, if you look at
their year returns, I'm sorry, you look
at their profitability are very, very
good executing well, I think that, you
know, maybe some people just wanted some
more there.
Goldman Sachs also strong quarter they
did miss on equities trading.
So, you know, these numbers are hard to
predict.
But I think, you know, most people,
including myself, you know, if you had
seen sort of that, that upside would
give you sort of further confidence in
the momentum going into the next
quarter.
But the M&A advisory business, huge
outperformance there, we think they
probably outperformed most on the
quarter and they're the lead in that
revenue.
They announced this a I program.
There's details, you know, going to have
to wait till January for details, but
that signals that efficiency is going to
get better.
You know, contrast that, you know, to
companies that are really performing
very well to two companies that are, I
think have a lot of runway ahead of
them, and that's Wells Fargo and
Citigroup.
Can I just ask before we get to sorry,
because I've already asked him like ten
times today, why do the analysts
consistently underestimate what these
banks are doing?
And it can't just be to get on the good
side of management, Right.
When I see this morning before any
earnings came out, I saw stories about
which bank was going to beat estimates.
So when I see bank expected to top
estimates, I wonder why analysts don't
add more to the estimates.
What's why?
What is this game all about?
Well, first of all, trading and when
it's capital markets revenue, that
really is the source of the upside.
That is very tough.
And banks are not going to guide you.
Right.
You know, they don't really have an
incentive to shake your hand, guys, by
the way, like the last couple of days of
the quarter could be horrible or you
don't know what's going to happen.
And so I think banks are going to tend
to guide conservatively.
Analysts are going to tend to be
conservative.
Right.
Because that
and by the way, like that just is not
something that people bake into the run
rate.
So as I said, you know, we're positive
about the momentum in trading, the asset
levels, etc..
But I think if you're, you know, forming
estimates, you are going to tend to be
conservative.
And that's why you can get upside,
especially if the strength comes at the
end of the quarter.
It's just hard for the instruments to
catch up.
Yeah, I totally get it.
All right.
So we care about JPMorgan's results.
We also obsess over everything that
Jamie Dimon has to say.
He never disappoints is something that
is highly quotable in this case.
It was when he was talking about a
cockroach.
Check it out.
And you should assume that ever
something happens.
Reed scour all process, all procedures,
all underwriting all everything.
And, you know, we think we're okay with
all this stuff.
But I my my intent goes up and things
like that happen.
I probably shouldn't say this, but when
you see one cockroach, you're probably
more, you know, And so we should
everyone should be forewarned in this
one.
All right.
That, of course, was Jamie Dimon earlier
today on JPMorgan's earlier earnings
call.
Actually, come on in on this because
you're reporting on the quarter.
And, you know, most importantly, what
Jamie Dimon has to say about the macro.
So, again, Jamie Dimon has been running
the biggest U.S.
bank, which is which has a bigger market
cap today than its three closest rivals
combined.
He's been doing that for nearly 20 years
and he didn't get there.
And you didn't stay there
just on the back of sitting on his
laurels.
Right.
He's paid to look around the corners and
he's right to point out that the
underlying numbers might be great.
They might be marching toward another
record revenue here.
But when you see some of these problems,
you initially try and dismiss some of
them as idiosyncratic.
But if enough of them start popping up,
that becomes a concern.
So that's why when Diamond says my
antenna goes up, when things like that
happen, we pay attention.
Especially because in the last few days
we've been seeing some action in certain
corners of the credit market where it
does appear that there is some fear
seeping into the markets.
And Dimon specifically flicked at the
publicly traded BDCs that hold a lot of
these private credit investments.
And if you look at the discounter, the
net asset value that they're going at
it, it makes you worry about what's
happening with some of the other
non-traded vehicles.
Will there be master demolitions and
will there be domino effects off of
that?
And Dimon also points out that he feels
like they're feeling very good about
everything, that if you look at their
numbers, you will not see any cause for
stress, dismay, concern.
But Dimon is right in saying eventually
the cycle turns.
And when it does, he thinks that I
suspect when there's a downturn, his
words you will see higher than normal
downturn type of credit losses in
certain categories.
That's an important one to keep in mind,
because what he's saying is your
recovery rates might not be as great as
you imagine, and that will impact the
firms and that will impact the investors
in those firms.
I want to ask about Wells Fargo.
I'm so thankful that Bloomberg Radio has
such a great program in the mornings.
Nathan Hager and Karen Moscow, we were
talking to you, Alison, before I even
got to work yet.
And I get here pretty early and you were
saying this is really going to be the
news of the day and it has been the
outperformer of the day because can I
just say finally.
Well, because long in coming.
So what's the what's the story with
Wells Fargo?
They raised their return on tangible
equity.
So so the key metric for banks return on
tangible common equity valuations, you
know, price to book is is how a lot of
investors value these banks.
It's based on that return on capital.
And, you know, Charlie Scharf had said
years ago, we're going to put 15% out
there as a as a target.
We'll revisit it at some point.
They're running at 15% year to date.
They upped that target to 17 to 18%.
The asset cap is lifted.
They showed a lot of progress that
they've made, but they also showed some
opportunity.
And here's what I think is interesting.
So one of the biggest areas of
opportunity is the consumer unit.
When we had
Laurie Beer from Jp morgan, the CEO of
Jp morgan, talk about where she sees big
opportunity.
She actually talked about this at Jp
morgan's Investor Day, also the consumer
unit also like a lot of the a lot of
what she talked about in terms of how
technology was going to aid the bank was
in that it was productivity in the
consumer unit.
So we're hearing that from Wells Fargo.
So that really gives me confidence that
this is a number that they can chew to.
Citigroup, by the way, I think, you
know, they're also kind of showing the
path, right?
So Citigroup talking about the fact that
they are sort of two thirds the way
there with their transformation.
And we have Banamex coming.
You know, it's pushed out a little bit.
But I think showing you the path that,
you know, could that be Citigroup again,
talk about an even longer time.
But could could could Jane Frazier
finally be the one to get it done?
And I will point out, like with Wells
Fargo now up, what, 8.2% for the day,
it's their best day since since election
night, since Trump came back to power.
This could be Wells Fargo's best day
since then.
So that is the power of putting a target
out there.
And I point that out again only because
in a couple of weeks you will have Bank
of America with their Investor Day,
their first Investor Day in 15 years.
It has also been the worst performing
big bank stock this year, up only, what,
14%?
14 and change.
It is important for Bank of America to
approach that Investor Day with a
mindset of providing targets,
aspirational targets for the market
instead of wanting to go out there were
trying to explain to investors and
analysts what it is that they do,
because I think investors will tell you
they have a good understanding.
What they want is better targets and
what they want is them achieving those
targets.
Otherwise the stock will continue to
languish.
