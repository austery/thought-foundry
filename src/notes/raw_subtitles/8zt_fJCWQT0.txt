All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 are
 live.
 We've
 got
 Amazon,
 Apple,


Coinbase,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 Roku.
 We've


got
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 to
 talk
 about.


Obviously,
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 are
 the
 big


ones
 that
 we
 will
 be
 taking
 a
 look
 at
 in


the
 next
 15
 minutes,
 and
 we're
 going to


be
 getting
 their
 results.
 Uh,
 besides


those
 companies,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 bit
 of


red
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 market
 close.
 As


you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 S&P
 500
 actually


violating
 that
 intraday
 low
 that
 it
 had


at
 940,
 uh,
 that
 we
 bounced
 off
 of
 for


the
 majority
 of
 the
 day,
 right
 back
 down


680.
 You
 know,
 I've
 been
 trying
 to
 think


for
 the
 past
 hour.
 I've
 been
 doing
 some


research
 trying
 to
 see
 what
 is
 the


reason
 for
 why
 uh
 we
 are
 getting
 this


red
 and
 I
 I'm
 open
 to
 hearing
 theories


in
 the
 chat.
 I
 have
 not
 found
 a


definitive
 headline
 that
 you
 could
 chalk


up
 for
 a
 explicit
 reason
 for
 why
 the


market
 is
 upset.
 Uh
 you
 know
 I
 can
 give


you
 the
 excuse
 that
 we
 were
 at
 all-time


highs,
 people
 are
 taking
 profits,
 yada


yada
 alos,
 you
 could
 say
 all
 those


things,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 that


does
 it
 justice
 to
 be
 honest.
 Uh
 which


might
 quite
 frankly
 mean
 there's
 not


really
 reason.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum.
 Uh,


not
 pretty.
 Obviously,
 BMR
 not
 pretty


either.
 40.
 It
 was
 at
 46
 last
 time
 I


checked
 it.
 Well,
 it's,
 you
 know,


another
 two
 bucks.
 Not
 a
 big
 deal,


right?
 44.86.
 That
 one's
 down
 10%
 on
 the


day.
 Uh,
 Bitcoin
 right
 below
 107.
 I'm


about
 to
 give
 you
 guys
 a
 stat
 about


Bitcoin.
 That's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 pretty.


So,
 just
 realize
 when
 you
 hear
 it,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 hear
 it.
 Uh,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 forget
 it.
 But,


nonetheless,
 it
 is
 true.
 Last
 time
 we


had
 a
 red
 October
 for
 a
 Bitcoin
 that
 was


negative3%
 or
 more.


November
 ended
 up
 being
 negative
 36%.


Now
 that
 happened
 that
 happened
 back
 in


um


that
 happened
 back
 in
 2018
 and
 2018
 was


a
 whole
 different
 cycle.
 You
 had
 the
 Fed


hiking
 rates.
 You
 had
 a
 bare
 market.
 You


had
 a
 China
 trade
 war.
 All
 that
 all
 that


stuff.
 It's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things


that
 makes
 you
 think,
 all right,
 if


Bitcoin
 is
 red
 3%
 for
 the
 month,
 which


it
 looks
 like
 we're
 about
 to
 be.
 I
 mean,


we're
 down
 3%
 for
 the
 day
 on
 Bitcoin


106.5,


then
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what


happens
 in
 November.
 AMD
 right
 there


down
 2.86%.
 S&P
 500
 680,
 Nvidia
 down


2.362.
 I
 did
 buy
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


Meta
 Dip.
 I
 put
 out
 a
 post
 on
 Twitter
 at


the
 exact
 time
 that
 I
 bought
 it.
 659
 was


the
 price
 that
 I
 got.
 We
 did
 get
 a


bounce
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 679.
 This
 was


the
 post
 I
 put
 out
 at
 around
 11:37.
 So,


this
 was
 probably
 like
 20
 minutes
 after


the
 market
 open
 and
 I
 bought
 a
 little


bit
 more
 at
 659.
 Got
 the
 bounce
 still


above
 uh
 the
 lows
 of
 the
 day,
 but


nonetheless,
 even
 Meta
 obviously


struggling
 to
 maintain
 all
 of
 its


momentum.
 665
 right
 here.
 Still
 down


about
 11.45%


on
 the
 day.
 Santa
 Claus
 needs
 to
 visit


this
 year.
 Yes,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 need


Santa
 Claus
 to
 give
 us
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 visit


this
 year.
 Reddit
 down
 7.7%.
 Google's


holding
 on
 a
 little
 bit
 at
 283.
 Google


should
 be
 closer
 to
 300
 right
 now,
 but


obviously
 Google
 got
 hit
 right
 here
 uh


from
 its
 highs
 at
 295
 down
 to
 283.
 So,


that
 is
 my
 question
 everybody.
 Why
 do
 we


think
 we're
 uh
 we're
 dealing
 with
 some


of
 the
 red?
 I
 mean,
 what
 is
 the
 reason


that
 you
 have
 if
 you've
 been
 thinking


about
 it?
 Also,
 did
 anyone
 buy
 the
 dip?


What
 do
 we
 get?
 Did
 we
 buy?
 Did
 we
 buy?


BMR
 is
 officially
 below
 my
 cost
 basis.
 I


did
 not
 buy
 more
 today.
 Again,
 I
 have
 a


sizable
 position.
 I
 have
 6,000
 shares.


So
 to
 me
 it's
 like
 for
 me
 to
 add
 I
 it


really
 does
 need
 to
 be
 juicy
 for
 me
 to


add.
 It's
 it's
 pretty
 much
 a
 builtout


position
 which
 is
 why
 I'm
 not
 super


super
 and
 I
 did
 buy
 the
 dip
 three
 weeks


ago
 back
 at
 47.
 So
 I
 mean
 at
 this
 point


for
 me
 to
 buy
 I
 would
 need
 to
 see
 low


40s
 for
 it
 to
 actually
 get
 there
 and


I've
 been
 buying
 more
 Amazon
 over
 the


past
 month.
 So
 that
 is
 the
 one
 that
 I'm


more
 interested
 about
 going
 into


earnings.
 But
 nonetheless
 I
 would


imagine
 people
 would
 take
 advantage
 of


this
 dip.
 I
 would
 imagine
 people


probably
 bought
 Meta
 today.
 AMD
 down


2.62
 62
 pounder
 basically
 flat
 on
 the


day
 197.
 Then
 hood
 obviously
 getting
 hit


because
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 also


getting
 hit
 as
 well.
 Where
 is
 Rocket


Lab?
 Did
 that
 get
 hit?
 Down
 5%.
 Rocket


Lab.
 Wow.
 Down
 7.3.
 I
 see
 a
 bunch
 of


Dolingo.
 Meta.
 Novo
 Nordisk.
 Is
 Duolingo


actually
 doing
 okay?
 No,
 it's
 not.
 260s


for
 Dolingo.
 Let's
 check
 the
 stock
 draft


real
 quick.


Wow.
 I'm
 actually
 beating
 Matt.
 How
 the


hell
 am
 I
 beating
 Matt
 today?
 Matt's
 at


40.
 I'm
 at
 44.


What?
 What?
 What
 did
 Matt
 I
 guess
 Dutch


Bros
 collapse
 today
 from
 Matt?


Okay,
 we're
 back
 in
 first
 place
 even


with
 a
 44%
 negative
 move
 on
 Duolingo.


There
 you
 go.
 Steve's
 at
 7.8,
 Tanner's


at
 26.5,
 Chris
 is
 at
 11,
 Matt's
 at
 40,


and
 then
 I'm
 at
 44.05.


As
 for
 the
 stock
 draft,
 yeah,
 Chipotle


got
 wrecked
 today
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 maybe


you
 could
 make
 the
 argument
 that
 the


that
 the
 Chipotle
 dip
 along
 with
 some
 of


these
 other
 consumer
 companies
 signaling


some
 issues
 around
 the
 the
 state
 of
 the


consumer
 is
 causing
 some
 pain.
 Um,


again,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 this
 is
 the


reason,
 but
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 after


hitting
 an
 all-time
 high
 yesterday,


Nvidia
 getting
 to
 that
 five
 trillion


level,
 everything
 kind
 of
 pumping,
 you


know,
 markets
 have
 taken
 a
 breather.


Even
 though
 they
 took
 a
 breather
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 this
 has
 not
 been


the
 best
 October
 for
 the
 crypto
 assets


in
 particular,
 but
 nonetheless,


this
 is
 what
 we're
 dealing
 with.
 The


crypto
 accounts
 on
 Twitter
 are
 freaking


out.
 There's
 like
 these
 crypto
 media


accounts
 that
 are
 like,
 you
 know,
 we


Trump
 and
 G
 is
 resolved.
 You
 got
 the


rate
 cuts,
 you
 got
 the
 staking,
 you
 got


all
 the
 ETFs
 approved,
 you
 got
 Trump
 in


office,
 you
 got
 all
 the
 legislation


that's
 needed.
 Why
 isn't
 it
 moving?
 And


I'm
 curious
 for
 the
 answer
 as
 well.


Like,
 why
 isn't
 it?
 Someone
 either
 is


getting
 liquidated
 or
 the
 market
 is
 just


not
 thinking
 of
 Bitcoin
 as
 a
 hedge
 to


inflation.
 They're
 not
 thinking
 of
 it
 as


an
 asset
 they
 want
 to
 get
 exposure
 to.


Gold
 is
 actually
 up
 on
 the
 day,
 which
 is


quite
 telling,
 right?
 S&P
 500
 down,


Bitcoin
 down,
 gold's
 up
 1%
 back
 above


4,000.
 Silver
 at
 48.91.


Yeah,
 you
 could
 say
 it's
 priced
 in.
 All


the
 restaurants
 are
 down
 because
 of


Chipotle,


but
 I'm
 not
 exactly
 sure
 what
 caused
 the


move
 to
 the
 downside
 today.
 Let's
 look


at
 the
 heat
 map
 and
 then
 we'll
 talk


about
 Amazon,
 Apple,
 because
 we
 got
 that


going
 up.
 Yeah,
 Google's
 the
 only
 one


holding
 on.
 Google,
 healthcare,
 and


financial
 issues
 doing
 okay.
 Everything


else,
 consumer
 defensives,
 all
 right,


even
 Amazon
 getting
 hit
 right
 before


earnings,
 too,
 which
 I
 actually
 like.


Uh,
 versus
 gapping
 up,
 but
 Amazon
 right


there
 down
 about
 2.49%.


You
 got
 less
 soybeans
 than
 needed.


Exactly.
 You
 got
 less
 soybeans
 than


needed.
 Cheesecake
 did
 take
 a
 hit
 a


couple
 days
 ago
 when
 they
 had
 their


earnings.
 Cheesecake
 down
 another
 2.75.


Quantum's
 holding
 up
 today.
 I
 know
 Oakl


was
 a
 bit
 red.
 Quantum's
 holding
 up.


Quantum
 D.
 Wow.
 Dwave's
 up
 seven,
 NQ
 is


flat,
 and
 Regetti


is
 up
 8%.


All
 right,
 so
 Quantum
 is
 the
 hedge,


folks.
 Quantum
 is
 the
 hedge.
 The
 10-year


as
 well
 has
 not
 really
 been
 cooperating


today.
 The
 10ear,
 look
 at
 that,
 back
 up


above
 4%.
 Bitcoin's
 down,
 S&P's
 down,
 10


years
 up.
 Big
 tech
 earnings
 yesterday


were
 good,
 but
 I
 guess
 not
 great.


Particularly
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Meta,
 which


kind
 of
 really
 threw
 everything
 off.
 I


think
 if
 Meta
 didn't
 have
 that
 massive


EPS
 miss,
 maybe
 it
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 as


bad
 as
 uh
 the
 street
 had
 priced
 it
 in


today.
 But
 nonetheless,
 you
 got
 Meta


getting
 ahead.
 Grab,
 you
 know,
 not


really
 tanking
 today,
 which
 is
 good.


Acting
 as
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 hedge
 as


well,
 still
 holding.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 very


impressive.
 It's
 holding
 above
 six
 on
 a


on
 a
 1%
 down
 day
 on
 the
 S&P,
 which
 is


basically
 where
 we're
 at.
 The
 fact
 that


Grab's
 holding
 six,
 I
 mean,
 that
 is
 a


bit
 impressive
 to
 me
 today.
 We
 have


earnings
 on
 Monday,
 so
 we're
 going
 to


see.
 But,
 uh,
 nonetheless,
 you
 have
 some


pockets
 of
 the
 market
 holding
 up
 S&P


500.
 They're
 680.5
 50
 cents
 away
 from


going
 below
 680.
 Fear
 agreed.
 Yeah,


where
 are
 we
 right
 now
 on
 that?
 We
 are


at
 fear.
 Back
 to
 fear.
 We
 ran
 neutral


yesterday.
 We
 were
 at
 47
 yesterday
 and


now
 we
 are
 at
 38
 on
 fear.
 Roadblocks


also
 still
 haven't
 gone
 through
 the


earnings
 enough
 to
 understand
 what's
 the


issue.
 They
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom.
 That
 stock
 down
 14.5%


on
 the
 day.
 Is
 this
 ALOS?
 I
 don't
 want


to
 say
 that's
 the
 reason,
 but
 it
 largely


does
 feel
 like
 that
 that's
 the
 reason.
 I


mean,
 again,
 if
 I
 had
 to
 paint
 together


a
 story,
 the
 story
 is
 two
 parts.
 Number


one,
 we
 read
 alltime
 highs
 yesterday.


Market's
 a
 little
 upset.
 Uh
 not not


upset
 that
 we're
 at
 alltime
 highs,
 but


in
 general,
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 to
 alltime


highs,
 need
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


breather,
 take
 some
 profits.
 It
 seems


like
 that
 could
 be
 what's
 happening


right
 here.
 And
 then
 the
 second
 part
 of


the
 story
 is
 that
 Meta
 just
 didn't
 have


the
 best
 earnings.
 And
 although
 Google


and
 Microsoft
 executed,
 Meta
 didn't.


Now,
 again,
 Meta
 right
 there
 670.
 I
 am
 a


bit
 confused
 on
 Meta.
 talked
 about
 this


in
 the
 morning,
 but
 I
 don't
 understand


how
 the
 market
 can
 give
 Nvidia
 a
 $5


trillion
 market
 cap
 and
 then
 give
 Meta
 a


10%
 hit
 because
 Meta
 is
 spending
 too


much
 on
 capex.
 And
 the
 reason
 this


doesn't
 make
 sense
 to
 me
 again,
 you


can't
 say
 the
 company
 that's
 selling
 the


product
 that
 is
 pushing
 it
 to
 a
 $5


trillion
 valuation


should
 go
 up,
 but
 the
 company
 that's


buying
 the
 product,
 which
 is
 the
 reason


for
 why
 that
 other
 company
 is
 getting
 to


five
 trillion,
 should
 go
 down
 because


they're
 spending
 too
 much.
 Because
 then


you're
 assuming
 that
 the
 reason
 they're


spending
 too
 much
 or
 that
 the


implication
 of
 them
 spending
 too
 much
 is


that
 there's
 not
 going to
 be
 an
 ROI.


Well,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 if
 there's
 not


going
 to
 be
 an
 ROI
 for
 all
 this
 capex


spend
 for
 Meta,
 they're
 going
 to
 stop


spending
 at
 some
 point.
 And
 if
 they're


going
 to
 stop
 spending,
 that's
 going
 to


hurt
 Nvidia,
 which
 means
 theoretically


you
 should
 be
 concerned
 about
 Nvidia
 and


the
 overall
 capex
 ecosystem
 if
 you're
 so


concerned
 about
 Meta.
 Now,
 granted,


Microsoft
 and
 Google
 are
 not
 facing
 that


same
 type
 of
 pain,
 which
 means
 the


street
 is
 more
 heavily
 focused
 on
 Meta


in
 particular,
 wasting
 money.
 Uh,
 but


then
 you
 look
 at
 their
 revenue
 growth,


you're
 like,
 well,
 what
 do
 you
 mean


wasting
 money?
 like
 they're
 up
 26%


year-over-year.
 That's
 faster
 than
 every


other
 big
 tech
 company
 outside
 of


Nvidia.
 So,
 it's
 like
 it
 is
 a
 bit


perplexing
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 Meta


today.
 But,
 nonetheless,
 that
 one
 is


getting
 hit.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 223
 down


3%
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 close.
 Let's
 do
 a


pump
 or
 dump
 right
 here
 and
 see
 what


we're
 thinking
 on
 Amazon.


And
 I
 know
 this
 is
 the
 one
 that
 most


people
 own


in
 the
 chat
 out
 of
 the
 names
 that
 we


have.
 Triple
 V,
 thank
 you
 for
 being


here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 ch
 super
 chat.


Uh
 TripleV
 is
 long
 Amazon.
 I'm
 not
 sure


how
 many
 shares.
 I
 I
 do
 believe
 it's


over
 100,000,
 but
 he's
 had
 Amazon
 for
 a


while.
 He's
 been
 successfully
 selling


calls
 on
 Amazon.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 one
 it's


been
 one
 of
 the
 best
 max
 stocks
 to
 sell


calls
 on.
 Doesn't
 have
 the
 best


premiums,
 but
 uh
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 get


called
 away
 if
 Amazon's
 flat.
 So,
 this


one
 will
 be
 an
 earnings
 that
 is
 going
 to


be
 important
 for
 his
 portfolio.
 So,
 we


have
 Amazon
 today,
 we
 have
 Apple
 today,


we
 have
 Micro
 Strategy,
 we
 have
 Roku,
 we


have
 Coinbase.


Um,
 I'll
 pull
 up
 the
 other
 companies


that
 we
 have.
 Reddit,
 Cloudflare,
 let
 me


know if
 you
 know
 own
 any
 of
 these
 in
 the


chat.
 We're
 going to
 put
 them
 on
 the


screen.
 Cloudflare,
 Reddit,
 a
 lot
 of


different
 consumer
 companies,
 tech


companies,
 all
 different
 parts
 of
 the


economy
 that
 we'll
 be
 looking
 at.
 Uh,


Atlassen,
 Twilio.
 You
 got
 some
 software


names
 in
 here.


Atlassen,
 Twilio.


Um,
 and
 then
 you
 have
 other
 few
 sectors


like
 Lumen,


Lumen,
 and
 First
 Solar.
 So,
 we
 also
 have


some
 energy
 right
 there
 as
 well.
 Yeah,


BMR.
 Again,
 Ethereum
 getting
 hit
 today


is
 obviously
 why
 that
 one's
 getting
 hit.


And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how


this
 one
 ends
 up
 playing
 out
 for


Ethereum
 as
 we
 get
 into
 November.
 We


only
 have
 one
 more
 day
 left
 of
 October.


What
 did
 most
 of
 you
 guys
 say
 in
 the


chat?
 60%
 of
 people
 saying
 pump.
 Okay,


60%
 of
 people
 saying
 pump.
 Amazon
 should


be
 at
 405.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 the


results
 relatively
 soon


and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Pounder
 right
 there.
 194
 getting
 a


red
 candle
 right
 into
 the
 close.
 We
 got


3
 minutes
 left.
 197
 to
 194
 on
 pounder.


You
 definitely
 have
 some
 selling
 that's


happening
 right
 there.
 S&P
 is
 about
 to


lose
 680.
 It
 looks
 like
 it's
 about
 to


potentially
 lose
 680


after
 a
 day
 like
 today.
 We
 got
 a
 pump,


right?
 Well,
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 people


are
 expecting,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.
 We
 got


to
 see.
 Again,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the


guy
 who
 says
 this,
 but
 we
 were
 at
 647


two
 weeks
 ago.
 So
 at
 680
 like
 it's
 it's


one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 obviously
 a


lot
 of
 investors
 are
 impatient
 and
 you


know
 they
 were
 just
 at
 690
 so
 now
 the


680
 feels
 like
 a
 whiplash
 which
 it
 is
 1%


down
 does
 feel
 like
 a
 whiplash
 from


yesterday
 but
 it's
 way
 better
 than
 where


we
 were
 3
 weeks
 ago.
 The
 other
 reason


the
 markets
 might
 be
 down
 today
 is


because
 we
 don't
 have
 an
 official
 China


deal.
 So
 again
 we
 got
 the
 China


negotiation
 framework
 that
 was


established
 yesterday
 by
 Trump
 and


descent
 but
 there
 is
 not
 a
 specific
 deal


officially
 that
 has
 been
 signed.
 That


could
 be
 another
 reason
 that
 the


market's
 upset.
 Um,
 and
 I
 guess,
 you


know,
 that's
 why
 they're
 saying
 we're


not
 going
 to
 move
 higher
 until
 we
 figure


out
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 China.


But,
 nonetheless,
 this
 is
 what
 we've
 got


going
 on.
 We
 got
 two
 minutes
 left.
 Let


me
 do
 this
 final
 poll
 in
 the
 chat.
 So,


which
 one
 outperforms


today,


Apple
 or
 Amazon?
 Now,
 Amazon
 or
 Apple


doesn't
 report
 until
 420.
 So,


technically,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 some


time
 before
 we
 see
 Apple.
 The
 rest
 of


these
 companies
 should
 be
 reporting


pretty
 soon
 as
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market


closes


and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 they
 say


and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 results
 that
 they


can
 put
 up.
 Amazon
 three
 down
 3%
 today


is
 kind
 of
 sketchy.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look
 my


my
 thoughts
 and
 we
 said
 this
 in
 the


morning
 that
 I
 think
 Amazon
 can
 get


below
 200
 or
 close
 to
 200
 if
 AWS


acceleration
 is
 not
 good.
 I
 think
 I


think
 it
 can
 blast
 through
 the
 uh
 the


230s.
 The
 implied
 move
 is
 6.7%.
 So


you're
 looking
 at
 212
 or
 241
 based
 on


what
 they
 do
 with
 AWS
 guidance.
 I
 think


it
 all
 rests
 on
 AWS,


but
 obviously
 the
 other
 parts
 of
 the


business
 are
 going
 to
 be
 relevant
 here.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see,
 look
 at
 that.


Yeah,
 dumping
 fully
 dumping
 into
 the


close,
 losing
 pretty
 much
 all
 of
 its


moves.
 It's
 getting
 closer
 to
 my
 average


that
 it
 had
 over
 the
 past
 week.


And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends


playing
 out.
 We
 have
 Rocket
 today
 as


well.
 We
 got
 Rocket.
 So,
 we'll
 put
 that


on
 the
 list


and
 we
 will
 take
 a
 look
 at
 all
 these


companies
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 close.


All right,
 folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 This
 is
 the


last
 day
 until
 Nvidia,
 which
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 month
 away
 from
 now
 for
 earnings.


So,
 Amazon
 and
 Apple
 is
 going
 to
 be


wrapping
 up
 big
 tech
 earnings
 for
 Q3.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It


is
 Thursday,
 October
 30th.
 The
 stock


market


is
 now
 closed.


All
 right.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Here
 we
 go.
 We're


gonna
 see
 what
 happens.
 Mr.
 Sam
 is
 here


to
 join
 me.


>> Sam,
 you
 ready?


>> Let's
 go.


Amazon
 is
 Sam's
 biggest
 position
 if
 I'm


not
 wrong.
 So,


>> might
 not
 be
 after
 this.


>> Might
 not
 be
 after
 this.
 We're
 gonna


see.


>> We
 are
 going
 to
 see.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 we'll
 get
 the
 results
 in


a
 second.
 Hood
 ends
 4.7%
 down
 in
 the


day.
 Pounder
 down
 2%.
 Tesla
 down
 4.6.


Nvidia
 down
 2.08.
 Nvidia
 is
 now
 no


longer
 a
 $5
 trillion
 company
 as
 of


today's
 move.
 S&P
 down
 1%.
 AMD
 down
 3.4.


SoFi
 down
 6%.
 Google's
 held
 on
 in
 a
 sea


of
 red
 with
 some
 of
 the
 green.
 Grab
 down


1%,
 Reddit
 down
 7%,
 Amazon
 again
 down


3%,
 Meta
 down
 11%,
 Meta
 with
 those
 $2


billion
 of
 bonds
 today.
 By
 the
 way,
 we


got
 an
 update
 an
 hour
 ago.
 There
 was
 125


billion
 of
 demand
 for
 the
 25
 billion
 of


bonds,
 which
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 But


there
 was
 demand
 for
 those
 Metabonds


that
 came
 out
 this
 morning.
 Apple
 right


there
 closes
 at
 271.
 All right,
 do
 we


have
 earnings?
 Let's
 see.
 Do
 we
 have


something?
 Amazon
 goes,
 oh
 my
 goodness,


we're
 green.
 We're
 green.
 Green.
 Green,


baby.


We
 are
 green.


237.
 Wow,
 that
 dump
 was
 such
 a
 head


fake.


That
 dump
 was
 such
 a
 head
 fake
 into
 the


close.
 240.
 Can
 we
 get
 240?
 239


on
 Amazon.
 Let
 me
 get
 the
 numbers
 in
 a


second.
 Amazon
 up
 8%.
 241.


Let's
 go.


Let's
 freaking
 go.
 I
 will
 get
 the


numbers
 in
 a
 second.
 This
 is
 a
 big
 move.


Let's
 see
 if
 it
 can
 hold
 it.
 Let's
 see


if
 it
 can
 actually
 hold
 it.
 That's
 the


most
 important
 thing.
 Can
 we
 hold
 these


numbers
 on
 Amazon?
 Wow.
 24%


beat.


24%


beat.
 195
 versus
 157
 on
 EPS.


Revenue
 180
 versus
 177.
 That's
 a
 $3


billion
 beat
 and
 a
 40
 cent
 beat
 on
 EPS.


EPS
 is
 up
 36%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is


up
 13%
 year-over-year.
 Amazon


242,
 baby.


>> We
 needed
 that
 one.
 We
 really


needed
 that
 stuff,
 dude.
 I
 needed
 that.


I
 needed
 that.
 Um,
 it
 looked
 pretty


scary
 coming
 to
 close.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


shoot.
 Oh,
 shoot.
 Hold
 on."
 AWS
 revenue


beat
 on
 the
 top
 line.
 Hold
 on.
 I'm


trying
 to
 pull
 up
 AWS
 growth.


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 the
 numbers
 as
 well.


I'll
 get
 in
 a
 second.
 But
 boy,
 did
 we


need
 that
 one.
 245.


It's
 pushing.


>> Wow.


>> It's
 actually
 doing
 doing
 the
 thing.
 Let


me
 uh
 let
 me
 try
 to
 get


>> Yes.


>> Uh
 let
 me
 get
 the
 actual
 numbers
 on


their
 website
 for
 a
 second.
 Let
 me
 pull


this
 up.
 I
 hope
 it
 doesn't
 pull
 a


PayPal.
 That
 would
 really
 suck.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 so
 we
 got
 to


see
 how
 good
 these
 numbers
 are
 to
 really


see
 if
 it
 could
 pull
 a
 PayPal.
 I
 don't


have
 the
 official
 numbers
 yet.
 246.
 Wow.


Market
 loves
 it.
 Okay,
 let
 me
 get
 I


think
 I
 have
 some
 coverage
 right
 here.


Let
 me
 get
 it.


>> Let's
 just
 go.
 All right,
 here
 we
 go.


We'll
 get
 deeper
 into
 the
 numbers


>> on
 Amazon


>> for
 revenue.
 another
 beat
 of
 180.17


billion
 versus
 177.8
 billion
 expected.


But
 AWS,
 it's
 cloud
 business,
 it's


profitability
 engine,
 that's
 where


everybody
 was
 looking.
 We're
 looking
 at


a
 beat
 there
 of
 33
 billion
 versus
 32.42


billion
 expected.
 What's
 really
 key


there,
 John,
 is
 that
 it's
 a
 growth


figure
 of
 20%
 year-over-year.
 That's


higher
 than
 even
 the
 Whisper
 estimates


from
 the
 street,
 which
 were
 in
 the
 range


of
 18
 and
 a
 half
 to
 19.


>> That's
 the
 number,
 baby.
 That
 is
 the


number.
 AWS
 delivered.


AWS
 delivered.
 Street
 thought
 it
 would


come
 in
 at
 18.5.
 We
 came
 in
 at
 20%.


That's
 the
 number.


>> Yes.
 There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go,
 Amazon.


There
 you
 go.
 Jeff
 Bezos
 coming
 through.


>> They
 came
 through.


>> It's
 still
 Jeff
 Bezos.
 It's
 still
 Jeff


Bezos.
 It's
 still
 Jeff
 Bezos.


>> That's
 the
 number.
 That's
 what
 we


needed.


>> Those
 shares
 10%
 higher.
 Investors
 are


liking
 what
 they're
 seeing
 at
 the
 print.


I'll
 get
 you
 more.
 I'm
 digging
 into
 this


now.


>> All
 right,
 Mackenzie
 Sagalas.
 Thanks.


>> Wow,


>> this
 sucker
 250.


>> No,
 I
 just
 spent
 the
 past
 hour
 and
 a


half
 saying
 that
 Meta
 is
 misunderstood.


This
 market's
 stupid
 and
 Amazon
 was


going
 to
 crush.
 So,


>> wow.


>> Did
 you
 read
 through
 the
 press
 release?


>> No,
 I
 did.
 I
 still
 can't.
 Is
 it
 up
 yet?


I
 can't


>> freaking
 out.
 The
 whole
 press
 release
 is


up.


Give
 me
 a
 second.
 Let
 me


>> Net
 sales
 increased
 13%


year-over-year.


AWS
 20%
 year-over-year
 to
 33
 billion.


North
 America
 11%
 year-over-year.


International
 14%.
 Operating
 income
 17.4


billion.
 I
 mean,
 this
 just
 goes
 back
 to


what
 I
 was
 saying
 last
 night
 and


earlier.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 on
 their
 way
 to


getting
 a
 20%
 operating
 margin
 in
 the


next
 several
 years.
 I
 think
 they're


going
 to
 do
 it
 by
 the
 time
 2029
 is
 over


and
 this
 will
 be
 a
 200
 billion
 operating


income
 company
 off
 of
 a
 trillion


revenue.
 I
 mean,
 this
 was
 a
 freaking


smash.
 Absolute
 smash.


>> Okay,
 so
 a
 couple
 of
 uh
 quotes
 right


here.
 Yeah,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


Um


really
 important
 quotes
 from
 this


perspective.
 Jasse
 says
 AWS
 growing
 at
 a


pace
 we
 haven't
 seen.
 And
 guys,
 we'll


get
 to
 all
 the
 other
 earnings
 in
 a


second.
 Let
 me
 just
 get
 through
 this
 and


then
 we'll
 get
 to
 the
 other
 one.
 Uh
 Jack


says
 AWS
 reacelerating
 to
 20.2%


year-over-year.
 He
 also
 says
 we
 are


growing
 at
 a
 pace
 we
 haven't
 seen
 since


2022,


which
 is
 music
 to
 the
 streets
 ears,


especially
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AWS.
 So


that's
 really
 important.
 And
 then
 to
 get


into
 some
 specific
 numbers
 right
 here,


let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 Uh
 revenue
 180


versus
 177,
 AWS
 33
 versus
 32.
 Operating


income
 17.4.
 Net
 income
 21.2
 that's
 up


almost
 40%
 year-over-year.
 Cash
 flows
 up


16%.
 free
 cash
 flows
 almost
 15
 billion


and
 then
 guidance
 206
 to
 213
 that
 is


ahead
 of
 the
 street
 expectation
 as
 well


and
 that
 is
 why
 aid
 Amazon
 is
 green.
 All


right,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 Amazon
 in
 a


second.
 Let
 me
 get
 some
 of these
 other


numbers
 but
 Amazon
 right
 there
 not
 too


bad.
 Nice
 8%
 move
 after
 hours.
 All


right,
 so
 Micro
 Strategy
 that's
 down
 8%.


I
 think
 that's
 more
 because
 of
 Bitcoin.


We'll
 get
 their
 numbers
 in
 a
 second.


Roku
 nasty
 hit
 down
 6%.
 Coinbase
 down


four.
 Cloudflare
 down
 two.
 Reddit
 down


one.
 Atlassen's
 up
 12.
 Twilio's
 up
 five


for
 Solar
 is
 down
 seven.
 Let
 me
 get


these
 numbers
 in
 a
 second
 on
 these.


Again,
 Amazon
 with
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and


the
 bottom.
 24%
 beat.
 Coinbase
 28%


beast.
 150
 versus
 117.
 That's
 a
 a
 pretty


nice
 beat
 by
 almost
 33
 cents.
 18.6


versus
 1.8
 billion
 on
 revenue.
 So,


you've
 got
 Coinbase
 beating
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 line.
 Stocks
 still
 down.


Crypto
 having
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 ugly


day.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 some
 pain.


Reddit,
 wow,
 54%
 beat
 on
 EPS.
 80
 cents


versus
 52
 cents
 expected.
 Reddit
 just


went
 green.
 222.
 There
 you
 go.
 EPS
 is


now
 up
 400%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue
 is


up
 68%
 year-over-year.
 5.84
 versus
 549.


You
 got
 a
 double
 beat
 and
 a
 hell
 of
 a


beat
 on
 EPS
 for
 Reddit,
 which
 has
 only


been
 public
 for
 a
 year
 now.
 So,
 pretty


incredible
 for
 them.
 Twilio
 125
 versus


107.
 That's
 a
 beat
 by
 17%
 on
 EPS.
 1.3


versus
 1.25
 billion.
 That's
 beat
 by
 4%


on
 revenue.
 Revenue
 is
 up
 15%


year-over-year.
 EPS
 is
 up
 23%


year-over-year.
 Twilio's
 up
 6%
 after


hours.
 Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies


beating
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom,
 which


is
 very
 nice
 to
 see.
 Amazon
 right
 there


still
 holding
 245,
 not
 really
 giving


that
 up
 as
 AWS
 accelerates.
 At
 lasten,


another
 doubledigit
 beat
 on
 EPS
 24%
 104


versus
 84
 cents,
 1.43
 versus
 1.4
 on


revenue.
 EPS
 is
 up
 35%
 year-over-year.


revenue
 was
 up
 21%


yearover-year.


Coinbase
 is
 down,
 Roku
 is
 down,
 but


these
 other
 ones
 are
 up.
 Let
 me
 get
 some


coverage
 right
 here
 on
 Roku
 and


then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Reddit
 is
 making


the
 move
 about
 5%
 right
 now
 after
 hours.


>> Roku
 shares
 plummeting.
 This
 despite


earnings
 beating
 16
 cents
 per
 share


versus
 the
 9
 cent
 per
 share
 analyst


consensus
 EPS
 revenues
 of
 1.21
 21


billion
 were
 right
 in
 line
 with


estimates.
 But
 if
 you
 want
 to
 look
 at


the
 cause
 or
 one
 of
 the
 causes
 of
 the


drop
 in
 the
 stock,
 the
 company's


streaming
 hours
 36.5
 billion.
 That's


over
 a
 billion
 short
 of
 analyst


estimates.
 The
 company
 saying,
 "We
 are


confident
 in
 our
 ability
 to
 deliver


double-digit
 platform
 revenue
 growth


while
 increasing
 operating
 margins
 in


2026
 and
 beyond."
 The
 company
 did
 to


guide
 to
 Q4
 revenues
 of
 1.35
 billion.
 is


just
 a
 hair
 ahead
 of
 the
 1.32
 billion


estimated
 and
 also
 guiding
 to
 Q4
 just
 E




I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I
EDIDA
 of
 145
 million
 ahead
 of
 131


million
 estimated
 but
 it
 looks
 like


there
 are
 those
 concerns
 um
 about
 the


streaming
 hours
 coming
 in
 short
 that's


really
 weighing
 on
 the
 stock
 here
 John.


>> All
 right
 yeah
 stock
 bouncing
 off
 those


initial
 lows
 but
 still
 down
 more
 than
 7


and
 a
 half%.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 more
 on


Amazon
 from
 Mackenzie
 Sagalos
 including


the
 guidance.
 Mackenzie


>> let's
 start
 there
 on
 guidance.
 So
 with


Q4
 revenue,
 it's
 in
 the
 range
 of
 206


billion
 to
 213
 billion,
 putting
 that


mid-range
 at
 209.5


uh
 versus
 the
 28.12
 billion
 expected.


And
 John,
 this
 would
 be
 their
 first
 $200


billion
 revenue
 quarter
 coming
 just
 5


years
 after
 it
 crossed
 the
 100
 billion


threshold.
 Uh
 moving
 on
 to
 Q4
 operating


income,
 it's
 also
 uh
 a
 little
 light


there
 actually
 in
 the
 range
 of
 21
 to
 26


billion.
 So
 that's
 23.5
 billion
 at
 the


midpoint
 versus
 23.8
 8
 billion.


>> All right,
 so
 AWS
 still
 doing
 pretty


well.
 Reddit
 looks
 like
 we
 got
 a


reversal,
 folks.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 just


happened
 there
 on
 Reddit.
 It
 was
 just
 at


225.
 That
 is
 a
 little
 weird.


That's
 a
 little
 weird.
 You
 got
 a
 big


dump
 right
 there.
 Something
 has
 to
 have


been
 said
 on
 the
 earnings
 or
 either


uh
 on
 a
 different
 part
 of
 their


guidance.
 Western
 Digital,
 by
 the
 way,


that
 one's
 running.
 That's
 up
 4%.
 We


have
 those
 earnings.
 I'll
 get
 that
 in
 a


second.
 Reddit,
 not
 sure
 what
 happened.


First,
 Solar,
 they
 are
 down
 by
 about


6.2%.
 Amazon
 still
 holding
 the
 240s


right
 here.
 Netflix
 announces
 a
 split.


Really


like,
 okay,
 cool.
 Thanks,
 Netflix.
 Uh,


that
 was
 kind
 of
 random.
 Netflix
 up
 2%.


Huh.


I
 guess
 they
 wanted
 to
 wait
 till
 after


earnings.
 10
 for
 one.
 Maybe
 Meta
 needs


to
 do
 that
 to
 save
 the
 day.
 Netflix


right
 there.
 All right,
 a
 10
 for
 one


split.
 Congrats
 if
 you
 own
 Netflix.
 Not


too
 bad
 for
 the
 split.
 Reddit,
 I'm
 still


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 why
 they
 took
 that


dump.
 They
 were
 just
 at
 230.
 Wow.
 185.


What
 is
 going
 on
 with
 Reddit?
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I
 can
 find
 any
 information
 on
 this.


Uh
 uh
 Intel,
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 acquiring
 an


AI
 chip
 company
 called
 Sambanova.


Netflix
 announces
 10
 for
 one
 split.


Rocket
 uh
 mortgage
 company
 they
 beat
 wow


by
 40%
 7
 cents
 versus
 5
 cents
 expected


1.783
 billion
 versus
 1.65.
 Pretty
 much


every
 company
 so
 far
 today
 has
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 and
 they
 beat


aggressively.
 Rocket
 right
 there
 after


hours
 that's
 also
 moving.


Not
 sure
 what
 the
 heck
 just
 happened
 to


Reddit
 184.
 We
 haven't
 seen
 that
 in
 a


couple
 weeks.
 That
 price
 something


they've
 had
 to
 said
 on
 their
 earnings
 is


creating
 a
 hit.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull


up
 their
 investor
 relations.
 Amazon
 I


still
 don't
 have
 the
 press
 release.


should
 begin
 in
 a
 second.


Something
 is
 uh
 getting
 hit.
 Uh
 Sam,
 any


thoughts
 on
 something
 you've
 seen
 from


Amazon
 so
 far?


>> Uh
 haven't
 AWS.


>> Well,
 AWS
 was
 the
 one
 I
 was
 looking
 for.


I'm
 actually
 basing
 off
 posted
 I'm


seeing
 online
 because
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 in


the
 um
 in
 their
 press
 release
 on
 the


website.
 So,
 trying
 to
 look
 for
 that


right
 now.
 Maybe
 it's
 on


>> Stock
 Titan.


Okay,
 we'll
 check
 that
 in
 a
 second.
 Um,


let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 Do
 we
 have
 Okay,
 we


got
 some
 coverage
 on
 Reddit.
 Give
 me
 one


second.
 Let's
 pull
 this
 up,
 guys.


>> The


51
 cents
 per
 share,
 revenues
 of
 $585


million
 ahead
 of
 estimates
 of
 546


million.
 The
 company
 also
 guiding
 to
 Q4


revenue
 and
 Ibida
 in
 ranges
 ahead
 of


analyst
 expectations.
 I
 just
 spoke
 with


CEO
 Steve
 Huffman,
 who
 told
 me
 that


Reddit's
 ad
 business
 continues
 to


outpace
 its
 peers
 with
 74%


year-over-year
 growth
 and
 75%
 growth
 in


total
 advertiser
 count.
 He
 said
 AI
 is


helping
 across
 the
 board
 to
 make
 better


recommendations
 and
 do
 more
 efficient


moderation.
 And
 when
 it
 comes
 to


licensing
 to
 AI
 companies,
 Huffman
 said


Reddit
 can
 be
 a
 big
 w
 AI
 winner
 without


all
 the
 typical
 AI
 costs.
 Now,
 John,


pivoting
 away
 from
 Reddit,
 shares
 down


about
 3%.
 Now,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 hit
 some


news
 on
 Netflix.
 Netflix
 just
 announcing


a
 10
 for
 one
 stock
 split.
 Um
 that
 will


be
 affected
 through
 an
 amendment
 to
 the


company's
 um
 certificate
 of


incorporation
 and
 that
 is
 uh
 set
 to
 be


as
 of
 the
 close
 of
 trading
 on
 Monday,


November
 10th.
 We
 see
 Netflix
 shares
 up


about
 two
 and
 a
 half%
 on
 this
 news.
 Back


over
 to
 you,
 John.


>> All
 right,
 Ladon.
 Thank
 you,
 Julia.


>> Okay.
 Still
 not
 sure
 why
 Reddit's


getting
 hit.
 Amazon
 still
 holding
 the


240s.


Uh
 BMR,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 that's
 up
 after


hours.
 Is
 Ethereum
 moving
 at
 all?
 ETH
 is


it's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 3650.
 Maybe


that's
 why
 BMR
 is
 moving.


Yeah,
 you
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red


candle
 right
 there
 or
 a
 green
 candle,


but
 not
 sure
 why.
 Reddit,
 I
 mean,


everything.
 I'm
 looking
 at
 their
 website


right
 here.
 I
 don't
 see
 anything
 crazy.


Uh
 Steve
 Huffman,
 Reddit
 provides


something
 rare
 on
 the
 internet.
 444


million
 people
 come
 here
 each
 week
 for


authentic
 conversations.
 they
 can't
 find


anywhere
 else
 and
 increasingly


engagement
 with
 the
 brands.
 Revenue
 is


up
 68%,
 ad
 revenue
 is
 up
 74%.
 They're


profitable.
 Net
 income
 163
 million.


That's
 up
 triple
 digits.
 Gross
 margin


91%.
 Free
 cash
 flow
 183.


Got
 to
 be
 something
 in
 the
 guidance
 that


could
 be
 causing
 some
 pain
 right
 here.


Uh
 but
 Reddit,
 that
 was
 a
 pretty
 big


move
 to
 the
 upside
 and
 now
 got
 the


reverse.
 Coinbase
 is
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move
 after
 going
 red.
 Coinbase


now
 up
 4%
 3.28%.
 28%.
 Coinbase
 did
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 We'll
 see
 if


there's
 anything
 specific
 right
 there
 on


Coinbase.


Uh,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 a
 28%
 beat
 and
 then


a
 beat
 by
 4%
 right
 here.
 Micro
 Strategy,


I
 don't
 see
 their
 earnings
 yet.
 Let
 me


see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 this
 up.
 Um,


Micro
 Strategy,
 do
 I
 have
 it?


I
 don't
 have
 it
 yet.
 Let's
 do
 a
 couple


others
 before
 we
 do
 micro
 strategy.


Also,
 we
 got
 Apple
 in
 about
 5
 minutes.


Or
 is
 it
 at
 4:30?
 Might
 be
 at
 4:30.


We'll
 have
 Apple
 soon.
 First
 Solar,
 they


beat
 on
 the
 top
 424
 versus
 422.
 Beat
 by


2%
 on
 the
 bottom.
 Revenues
 up
 80%


year-over-year.
 EPS
 up
 46%


year-over-year.
 Got
 Coinbase
 now
 getting


more
 into
 the
 green.
 Uh
 but
 First
 Solar


did
 get
 a
 beat.
 And
 then
 you
 had
 uh


Zillow
 with
 a
 100%
 beat.
 4
 cents
 versus


two
 cents
 expected
 on
 EPS.
 676
 million


versus
 670.
 EPS
 up
 150%
 year-over-year.


Revenues
 up
 16%
 year-over-year.
 Again,


the
 rate
 cuts
 should
 be
 rather
 bullish


for
 Zillow.
 Zillow
 going
 green
 after


hours
 as
 well.
 Cloudflare
 is
 pumping.


Okay,
 Cloudflare.
 There
 you
 go.
 You
 got


a
 move.
 Let's
 see
 if
 I
 have
 those


numbers.


Don't
 have
 those
 numbers
 yet,
 but
 the


street
 obviously
 likes
 it.


>> Reddit
 just
 went
 green.


>> Reddit
 just
 went
 green.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 weird,
 right?
 Like
 can
 do


you
 have
 any
 logic
 for
 why?


>> No.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 alos,
 but
 Reddit
 does


this
 all
 the
 time.
 So,
 after
 earnings


makes
 some
 crazy
 moves.
 Cloudflare
 is
 up


7%.
 Wow.
 Must
 have
 been
 really
 good


earnings.


Okay.
 Cloudflare
 revenue
 562
 versus
 544.


EPS
 27
 cents
 versus
 23
 cents.
 There
 you


go.
 There
 you
 go.
 For
 Cloudflare,
 that


is
 what's
 causing
 your
 move
 right
 there.


And
 that's
 why
 that
 one
 is
 getting


green.
 cloud
 for
 238.
 That's
 up
 4.7%.


I
 still
 don't
 have
 the
 Amazon
 press


release,
 so
 we
 can't
 go
 deeper
 into
 the


numbers.
 Oh,
 now
 now
 we
 got
 it.
 No,
 now


we
 don't
 because
 the
 site
 map
 is
 not


working.


>> It's
 on
 Seeking
 Alpha.
 I
 told
 you
 that.


>> No,
 but
 is
 that
 Amazon's


press
 release
 or
 is
 that
 Seeking
 Alpha


summary
 of
 Amazon's?


>> Um,


>> yeah.
 I
 don't
 I
 all
 I
 see
 is
 the


>> it's
 got
 to
 be
 the
 press
 release
 because


if
 go
 to
 the
 link
 I'm
 sending
 you
 in


private
 there's
 no
 way
 that
 they
 made


this
 a
 freaking


there's
 no
 way
 it
 has
 to
 be
 the
 original


one
 because
 it's
 so
 in-depth.


>> Yeah.
 Well


>> oh
 yeah
 you're
 right.
 You're
 right.


You're
 right.


>> Yeah.
 Stock
 Titan
 too.
 So
 that
 one
 has


>> it's
 been
 out
 for
 like
 20
 minutes.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Got
 it.
 Cool.
 All right.


Cool.
 So
 net
 sales
 increased
 13%
 180


billion.
 North
 America
 up
 11%


international
 segment
 up
 14%.
 AWS
 again


20%.
 That
 was
 the
 real
 number
 that
 we


needed
 to
 see.
 Reddit
 going
 back
 green.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 heck's
 happening


with
 Reddit,
 guys.
 Back
 above
 200.
 It


went
 from
 230
 to
 185,
 back
 to
 203.


Something's
 going
 on
 with
 that
 one.


Operating
 income
 17.4
 billion.
 Uh,


that's
 flat
 year-over-year.
 North


America
 4.8
 billion.
 Jasse,
 we
 continue


to
 see
 strong
 momentum
 and
 growth
 across


Amazon
 as
 AI
 drives
 meaningful


improvements
 in
 every
 corner
 of
 our


business.
 AWS
 is
 growing
 at
 a
 pace
 we


haven't
 seen
 since
 2022.
 That's
 really


why
 I
 think
 the
 street's
 excited.
 We


accelerate
 to
 20.2%.
 We
 continue
 to
 see


strong
 demand
 in
 AI
 and
 core


infrastructure.
 And
 we've
 been
 focused


on
 accelerating
 capacity,
 adding
 more


than
 3.8
 gawatts
 in
 the
 past
 12
 months.


In
 stores,
 we
 continue
 to
 realize
 the


benefits
 of
 innovating
 in
 our


fulfillment
 network,
 and
 we're
 on
 track


to
 deliver
 to
 prime
 members
 at
 the


fastest
 speeds
 ever
 again
 this
 year.


Expand
 same
 day
 delivery
 of
 perishable


groceries
 to
 over
 2,300
 communities.
 And


then
 they
 talk
 more
 about
 their
 tranium


2
 chip.
 I
 mean,
 we'll
 dig
 into
 the


numbers,
 but
 on
 the
 top
 line,
 this
 is


what
 you
 needed
 to
 see,
 and
 that's
 why


Amazon
 is
 holding


this
 240
 level.
 Yes,
 Netflix
 did
 have


that
 stock
 split,


and
 that's
 why
 that's
 helping
 Netflix


right
 here.


Um,
 Micro
 Strategy.
 Okay,
 let
 me
 see
 if


we
 can
 pull
 up
 MSTR.


I
 don't
 officially


have
 it
 yet.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up.


Again,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 they
 they
 they


have
 Fazby
 accounting
 now.
 So,
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 it's
 kind
 of a
 different
 way
 to


think
 of
 their
 earnings.
 Amazon,
 wow,


250.


By
 the
 way,
 there
 is
 Cloudflare
 17%
 beat


on
 EPS.
 These
 companies
 on
 EPS
 are
 just


like
 unbelievably
 outperforming.
 and


then
 3%
 on
 your
 revenue.
 Well,
 we
 didn't


hit
 250
 yet,
 but
 we
 got
 close
 to
 it.


24475
 still
 right
 there
 on
 Amazon.


Coinbase
 down
 2%.
 Roku
 is
 getting


dumped.
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 Wow,
 Micros


down.
 And
 that's
 not
 just
 because
 of


Bitcoin.


Feels
 like
 that's
 because
 of
 something


else.


Still
 waiting
 on
 Apple.
 Robin
 Hood


making
 a
 little
 That's
 weird.
 Robin
 Hood


and
 BMR.
 Wow.
 Robin
 Hood
 137
 to
 140


after
 hours.
 BMR
 almost
 43
 back
 up
 to


almost
 46.


Both
 crypto
 derivative
 plays,
 but
 Micro


Strategy


not
 really
 getting
 a
 I
 mean
 it
 got
 254


to
 260,
 so
 I
 guess
 there
 is
 a
 bounce


there,
 but
 it
 was
 at
 280
 at
 4
 p.m.


on
 MSTR.


Coinbase
 just
 bought
 300
 million
 worth


of
 Bitcoin.
 Wow.


Okay,
 I
 guess
 they're
 putting
 Bitcoin
 on


the
 balance
 sheet.
 Yeah,
 that
 is
 that
 is


confirmed.
 Coinbase


buying
 300
 million
 of
 Bitcoin.


Okay,


that's
 Wow.
 Coinbase
 buys
 300
 million.


Okay,
 so
 Coinbase
 is
 now
 officially
 I


mean
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 on
 their
 balance


sheet
 to
 an
 extent,
 but
 not
 at
 the
 level


that
 we're
 seeing
 it
 right
 there.
 That's


a
 third
 of
 a
 billion
 dollars
 for


Coinbase.
 There's
 that
 green
 candle


right
 there.
 Coinbase.


There
 you
 go.


That's
 getting
 the
 move
 right
 here.


Apple's
 at
 4:30,
 guys.
 So,
 we
 got
 10


minutes
 for
 Apple.
 We're
 going
 to
 see


what
 Apple
 says,
 but
 Coinbase
 still


making
 the
 moves.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 at


244.
 Apple's
 up
 1%.
 Twilio
 got
 a
 5%


move.
 All
 these
 companies
 have
 that


pretty
 much
 beat.
 First,
 Solar
 had
 a
 me


missing
 a
 beat
 in
 the
 solar
 space.
 That


one's
 down
 5%.
 Netflix
 pumping
 off
 of


that
 10
 for
 one
 split


and
 that's
 why
 that's
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 a
 move.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little


bit
 more
 coverage
 right
 on
 Amazon
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> You're
 not
 They
 seem
 to
 be
 hanging
 in


there
 quite
 well.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 for
 you


know
 any
 company
 um
 especially
 in
 in


that
 space
 whether
 you
 want
 to
 think


about
 it
 as
 tech
 or
 tech
 adjacent
 uh


because
 consumer
 discretionary
 at least


with
 Amazon
 and
 Tesla
 they
 get
 sort
 of


you
 know
 woven
 in
 with
 with
 the
 broader


tech
 space
 but
 any
 anything
 regarding


the
 focus
 the
 sharp
 focus
 on
 capex
 I


mean
 clearly
 that's
 been
 the
 story
 so


far
 this
 year
 that's
 where
 you
 know
 this


narrower
 base
 of
 US
 growth
 that
 we
 have


and
 the
 driver
 of
 growth
 it's
 clearly


been
 confined
 to
 that
 and
 I
 think
 that's


why
 capex
 has
 been
 so
 much
 under
 the


lens
 you
 know
 so
 so
 far
 this
 earning


season
 so
 to
 point
 about
 what
 is
 the


stability
 um
 and
 in
 the
 report
 that


Mackenzie
 was
 just
 talking
 about
 what


are
 the
 stable
 growers
 for
 companies
 and


revenue
 you
 know
 what's
 that
 revenue


generator
 that's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 maybe


as
 cyclical
 or
 as
 in
 focus
 as
 as
 capex


because
 you
 almost
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a


double-edged
 sword
 a
 little
 bit
 where
 if


they
 continue
 to
 raise
 their
 estimate


for
 what
 capex
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like


there
 are
 concerns
 and
 we've
 we've
 seen


a
 lot
 of
 these
 blips
 in
 the
 market
 and


corrections
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


years
 driven
 by
 some
 of
 the
 concerns


about
 that
 upping
 of
 of
 the
 number
 of


the
 forecast
 for
 capex
 but
 on
 the
 flip


side
 if
 they
 do
 start
 to
 pull
 back
 a


little
 bit.
 There's
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 concern
 of
 what
 do
 they
 know
 that


we
 don't
 or
 what
 do
 they
 see
 in
 terms
 of


some
 of
 the
 concern
 about
 that
 spending.


So
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 to
 the
 point


around
 what
 is
 the
 stability
 in
 terms
 of


revenue
 generation
 and
 overall
 profit


margin
 generation.
 I
 think
 that
 becomes


more
 of
 a
 focus
 for
 for
 earnings.
 Sure.


>> All
 right.
 You
 have
 trade
 representative


Greer
 who's
 speaking
 right
 now.
 We
 got


some
 quotes
 from
 him.
 Uh
 not
 the
 most


bullish
 quotes
 for
 Nvidia.
 Greer
 says,


"We
 spoke
 about
 chips
 with
 President
 Xi


broadly.
 Blackwell
 is
 not
 on
 the
 table


for
 China
 right
 now.
 Blackwell
 not
 on


the
 table
 for
 China
 right
 now.
 We
 spoke


with
 China.
 Where
 is
 Nvidia?


Um
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 after


hours.


Streets
 not
 loving
 that
 news.
 Still


holding
 above
 200.
 But
 I
 mean
 then
 again


the
 $500
 billion
 guidance
 didn't
 include


China
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 So
 that's


okay.
 Micro
 Strategy.
 All
 right.
 Missed


by
 13%
 on
 EPS842
 versus
 967.


uh
 beat
 by
 10%
 of
 revenue
 128
 versus


116.


Micro
 Strategy
 got
 a
 miss
 on
 EPS
 based


on
 what
 the
 street
 expected.


This
 stock
 not
 really
 moving
 that
 much


after
 hours.
 Again,
 Micro
 Strategy
 to
 me


is
 more
 so
 just
 a
 it's
 like
 BMR,
 right?


Like
 Bitcoin
 goes
 up,
 Micro
 Strategy


goes
 up.
 If
 it
 doesn't,
 it
 doesn't.
 So,


I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 the
 earnings


actually
 matter
 for
 MSTR.
 It's
 up
 2.2
 3%


after
 hours.
 The
 reason
 it
 was
 down
 7.5%


is
 because
 Bitcoin
 took
 a
 three
 and
 a


half%
 hit
 today.
 Uh,
 Bitcoin
 recovering


a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.
 Bitcoin
 right


there
 at
 1069.
 It
 did
 get
 all
 the
 way


down
 to
 1062,


but
 Amazon
 really
 the
 story
 of
 the
 day


at
 245.
 Microsoft
 up
 just
 a
 little
 bit


after
 hours.
 The
 under
 128
 million
 of


revenue
 is
 coming
 from
 their
 software


business,
 which
 I
 still
 don't
 understand


how
 they
 sell
 business
 analytics
 tools,


but
 nonetheless,
 they
 do,
 and
 that's
 why


they
 have
 that
 revenue.


Apple
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in
 six
 minutes.
 All


right,
 so
 we
 did
 the
 Amazon
 pump
 or
 dump


poll.
 Let's
 do
 the
 Apple
 poll
 and
 see


what
 people
 think.
 Um,
 77%
 of
 you
 said


Amazon
 outperforms.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


see.
 Apple's
 got
 some
 uh
 work
 to
 do
 if


it
 wants
 to
 beat
 Amazon's
 performance


today.
 But
 Apple,
 what
 are
 we
 thinking,


folks?
 Pump
 or
 dump.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the


chat
 if
 you
 own
 Apple.
 First
 of
 all,


congrats.
 Everyone
 owns
 Amazon.
 We've


been
 talking
 about
 this
 one
 for
 a
 while.


Sam,
 this
 is
 his
 biggest
 position.


Steve,
 I
 think
 you
 and
 I
 have
 had
 what,


three
 or
 four
 streams
 dedicated
 talking


to
 Amazon.
 So,


I'm
 a
 long-term
 shareholder.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I


have
 owned
 this
 since
 before
 the
 split.


Okay.
 Like
 long-term
 Amazon
 bull
 here.


>> You've
 owned
 it
 more
 than
 half
 the


people
 watching
 probably.


>> Dude,
 I
 I
 I've
 owned
 Meta
 since
 2012.


>> Actually,
 hold
 on
 a
 second.
 Wait,
 they


just
 had
 they
 just
 had
 this
 played
 a
 few


years
 ago.


>> Well,
 the
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 thing


about
 these
 big


>> Oh,
 wow.
 The
 thing
 about
 these
 big
 tech


companies
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 us
 are
 aligned
 on
 the
 fact
 and


people
 in
 the
 chat
 as
 well
 that
 2026


these
 companies
 are
 probably
 going
 to


keep
 getting
 bigger.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 get


an
 Amazon
 that
 hasn't
 moved
 all
 year,
 I


mean
 I
 mean
 that's
 really
 why
 I
 got


interested
 outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


Amazon.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wait,
 this
 is
 flat


all
 year."
 And
 then
 when
 you
 look
 into


it,
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 they
 have
 a
 couple


issues
 with
 their
 march."
 Stuff
 that
 can


be
 fixed,
 stuff
 that
 is
 not


>> Amazon,
 Meta,
 Alphabet,


they're
 deploying
 the
 amount
 of
 capital


that
 99%
 of
 companies
 will
 never
 see
 in


their
 lives
 or
 their
 existence.
 Okay?


>> Who
 is
 going
 to
 compete
 with
 them
 in


three
 or
 four
 years
 from
 now?
 Nobody.


>> They
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 nuts
 and
 bolts


of
 everything
 technology.
 They're
 going


to
 be
 the
 backbone
 infrastructure.


Nobody
 can
 compete
 with
 them.
 They're


just
 going
 to
 get
 bigger.
 And
 to
 think


that
 three
 months
 matters
 with
 something


selling
 off
 with
 one
 of these
 companies


is
 crazy
 to
 have
 that
 mindset.
 And
 last


night
 was
 a
 disgrace
 for
 anybody
 that
 uh


thought
 Meta
 deserved
 to
 be
 down
 where


it
 was.


>> No,
 I
 agree.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 about


Amazon,
 we
 keep
 talking
 about
 this


robotics
 revolution
 and
 so
 does
 so
 does


Jensen.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 other


company
 is
 more
 infiltrated
 with


robotics
 other
 than
 Amazon.
 If
 that


increases
 their
 operating
 margins
 by


even
 a
 couple
 percentage
 points,
 that's


tens
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 net


income
 every
 quarter
 that
 they're
 adding


to
 the
 bottom
 line.


>> So,
 Sam
 and
 Amit,
 did
 you
 see
 the


special
 on
 Amazon
 last
 night
 with
 the
 uh


Tridium
 chips
 and
 their
 new
 data
 center?


>> I
 watched
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the
 interview.


Yeah.


>> Crazy.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 the
 other
 thing.


They've
 got
 Anthropic
 and
 a
 lot
 of these


other
 foundation
 model
 companies
 buying


their
 chips.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 also


important.


>> Where's
 Marll
 after
 ours?


>> Where
 is
 Marll?
 They
 work
 with
 Amazon
 a


lot,
 right?
 Marll,
 it's
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a


pop.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 nice.


>> All
 right,


>> sign
 the
 chip.
 So,


>> Steve,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Apple?


Pump
 or
 dump?


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 pump.


Why?


is
 I
 think
 that
 the
 iPhone
 cycle
 was


dismissed
 as
 a
 nothing
 ber
 and
 I
 think


that
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 out
 that
 it
 was


better
 than
 expected
 I
 think
 on
 a
 year


basis
 because
 this
 is
 their
 fiscal
 year


they
 end
 this
 their
 Q4
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 good
 numbers
 and
 I
 think
 they're


going
 to
 be
 bullish
 going
 into
 the
 Q


what
 we
 consider
 Q4
 and
 next
 year
 I


think
 that
 everybody's
 all
 they
 have
 to


say
 is
 they're
 doing
 something
 with
 AI


and
 the
 street's
 going
 to
 eat
 it
 up


because
 nobody
 expects
 anything
 from


them
 with
 AI.


>> I
 think
 that's
 very
 fair.
 I
 think
 that's


very
 fair.
 And
 I
 also
 think
 that
 if
 Siri


is
 going
 to
 be
 that
 agentic
 tool
 that


all
 of
 us
 use
 and
 uh
 Tim
 Cook
 can
 every


can
 give
 any
 guidance
 on
 how
 big
 that


can
 scale
 in
 2026.


That
 would
 be
 very
 exciting
 for
 Apple.


Sam,
 you're
 you
 agree
 with
 Steve?
 You


think
 we're
 pumping
 on
 Apple?


Oh,


>> you're
 muted.


I
 would
 argue
 that
 that
 might
 be
 priced


in.
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 assumption
 that


they
 are
 going
 to
 accelerate
 phone


sales.
 I
 mean,
 it
 might
 go
 up,
 but
 you


know,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 it'll
 go


up
 listed.
 They
 seriously
 surprise


people,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 analysts
 have


already
 baked
 that
 in
 that
 you're
 going


to
 have
 that
 reaceleration.
 I
 mean,


that's
 why
 I'm
 in
 Amcore.
 That's
 part
 of


the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 in
 Amcore
 is
 is


because
 it's
 mostly
 the
 mobile
 device


expanding.
 So,
 I
 think
 if
 it's
 anything,


Amcore
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 benefit
 off


of
 that
 more
 than
 Amazon.
 I'm
 sorry,


Than
 Apple
 itself,
 especially
 since


Apple
 is
 a
 customer.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we'll


see
 what
 happens
 with
 that
 one.


>> My
 mic,


>> maybe
 pump
 or
 dump
 is
 the
 wrong


terminology.
 Maybe
 up
 or
 down
 is
 better


terminology.


>> Correct.


>> Yeah,
 just
 increase
 your
 volume
 a
 little


bit,
 Sam.
 That
 sh


>> It
 should
 be
 fixed
 now.


>> That
 That's
 a
 That's
 a
 little
 That's


That's
 a
 lot.
 Got
 to
 just
 get
 near
 the


middle.
 Uh
 the
 reason
 Micro
 Strategy
 is


moving,
 guys,
 is
 because
 they
 just
 said


that
 they
 are
 assuming
 Bitcoin
 will
 be


150
 by
 end
 of
 year.
 They
 are
 assuming


Bitcoin
 will
 be
 150
 by
 end
 of
 year


$150,000
 a
 coin.
 So
 I
 think
 that


guidance
 is
 getting
 the
 street
 to
 say


all
 right
 if
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 assuming


that
 uh
 and
 they
 continue
 to
 acquire
 you


know
 when
 you
 work
 out
 the
 MNAV
 maybe


that
 gets
 to
 a
 more
 attractive
 price


still
 down
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 day
 because


Bitcoin
 took
 a
 hit
 but
 they
 are
 still


assuming
 you
 know how
 companies
 have
 to


give
 guidance
 for
 like
 how
 much
 capex


they're
 going
 to
 spend
 micro
 strategies


they
 give
 guidance
 for
 like
 where
 they


think
 Bitcoin
 is
 going.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 why
 it's
 running
 or
 that's
 why


it's
 made
 its
 little
 Vshape,
 but


uh
 there
 could
 be
 another
 reason,
 but


that
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 reason
 that
 I'm


looking
 at
 right
 here.
 270
 on
 Micro


Strategy
 up
 from
 254.


That
 means
 ETH
 at least
 6K.
 Yeah,
 I


mean,
 you
 would
 imagine
 that
 would
 be


very
 good
 for
 Ethereum,
 but
 we
 have
 to


see
 if
 that
 can
 end.


>> Bitcoin
 bounced
 like
 a
 thousand
 bucks


though,
 so
 maybe


Bitcoin.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 that's
 true.
 107.


No,
 you're
 right.
 107.
 Yep.
 You're


right.
 That
 is
 fair.
 All right,
 Apple.


We
 should
 be
 getting
 results.
 We're


down.


We're
 down.


She's
 going
 red
 kind
 of.
 270
 to
 265.


That's
 not
 that
 crazy.


Let's
 see
 if
 it
 gets
 worse
 or
 if
 it


reverses.
 Apple's
 implied
 move
 is
 3%.


So,
 it
 should
 not
 be
 as
 volatile
 as
 an


Amazon.


I
 don't
 have
 the
 numbers
 yet.
 We
 should


be
 getting
 it
 any
 second.


Uh,


Apple,
 are
 we
 still
 red?
 We're
 still
 red


264.
 Again,
 this
 was
 Apple
 all
 of
 last


week,
 so
 it's
 not
 really
 a
 dramatic


decline.


Oh,
 we
 got
 it.
 All right,
 here
 we
 go.


>> Beats
 on
 the
 top
 and
 bottom
 lines
 here.


Let
 me
 go
 through.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to


unpack
 here
 as
 we
 see
 the
 stock
 down


about
 3%
 on
 first
 blush.
 EPS
 was
 a
 beat.


A$185
 compared
 to
 A$1.77
 expected.


Revenue,
 a
 small
 beat
 here,
 102.47


billion.
 Street
 wanted
 to
 see
 102.24.


Now,
 iPhone
 revenues,
 it
 was
 a
 miss.


That
 might
 be
 why
 we're
 seeing
 some


negative
 reaction
 here,
 but
 sales
 were


still
 up
 6%
 year-on-year.
 They
 came,


>> this
 is
 the
 first
 quarter
 in
 about
 three


quarters
 that
 they
 missed
 on
 iPhone


revenues,
 even
 if
 sales
 are
 up
 overall.


>> At
 49.03
 billion,
 Street
 was
 looking
 for


a
 little
 over
 50
 billion.
 Now,
 services,


this
 is
 of
 course
 the
 big
 growth
 engine


for
 Apple.
 It
 was
 up
 15%
 year-on-year
 to


28.75
 billion.
 That's
 a
 slight
 beat


here.
 Uh
 Street
 wanted
 to
 see
 28.17


billion.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 the
 end


of
 the
 fiscal
 year.
 This
 is
 the
 first


time
 the
 services
 business
 booked
 over


hundred
 billion
 in
 a
 year.
 China
 sales,


they
 were
 down
 about
 three
 12%.
 However,


we
 did
 get
 some
 guidance
 this
 time
 ahead


of
 the
 earnings
 call.
 I
 was
 just
 back


there
 in
 Apple
 Park
 talking
 to
 Tim
 Cook


about
 this.
 He
 was
 literally
 beaming


about
 this
 guidance.
 Uh
 December
 quarter


revenue,
 they
 are
 saying
 it's
 going
 to


be
 up
 10
 to
 12%
 yearonear.
 And
 iPhone


revenue
 for
 the
 December
 quarter.


They're
 now
 predicting
 up
 double
 digits


yearon
 year
 and
 saying
 this
 is
 going
 to


be
 the
 best
 ever
 sales.


>> Guys,
 that's
 a
 big
 deal.
 Apple
 grows


like
 four
 to
 5%.
 So
 a
 10
 to
 12%
 quarter


is
 a
 literal
 double
 of
 the
 last
 two


years
 of
 their
 growth
 rates.
 you
 can


understand
 why
 he
 was
 beaming
 if
 they're


guiding
 for
 10%
 growth


>> for
 the
 iPhone
 in
 the
 December
 quarter.


So,
 really
 strong
 guidance
 here
 uh


despite
 maybe
 little
 pockets
 of
 weakness


in
 the
 September
 quarter
 um
 results.
 And


then
 as
 far
 as
 uh
 some
 other
 uh
 data


here,
 I
 did
 talk
 to
 Tim
 Cook
 about
 those


results
 and
 talking
 about
 the
 demand
 uh


for
 the
 iPhone
 17.
 I
 know
 Dan
 Eis
 was


just
 talking
 about
 this.
 Uh
 he
 even
 said


there
 was
 demand
 for
 the
 iPhone
 16
 at


the
 tail
 end
 of
 that
 life
 cycle.
 Uh


here's
 what
 he
 said.
 On
 the
 16
 and
 17


for
 Q4,
 several
 models
 were
 supply


constrained
 and
 currently
 were
 supply


constrained
 on
 several
 models
 of
 the


iPhone
 17.
 That
 is
 again
 why
 we're


seeing
 such
 strength
 there
 in
 the


guidance
 numbers
 that
 they
 gave
 us.
 Um


as
 far
 as
 China,
 Tim
 Cook
 telling
 me,


quote,
 "We
 expect
 China
 to
 return
 to


growth
 this
 quarter
 because
 of
 the


reception
 of
 the
 iPhone
 there
 or
 the


iPhone
 17
 family."
 And
 then
 of
 course
 we


had
 to
 catch
 up
 on
 artificial


intelligence.
 Tim
 Cook
 telling
 us
 that


big
 AI
 update
 to
 Siri
 is
 still
 on
 track


to
 launch
 next
 year
 and
 also
 uh
 we


talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 integrating


some
 other
 AI
 models
 in
 there.
 There


have
 been
 so
 many
 talks
 about
 whether


that's
 Google
 or
 what
 have
 you.
 Um
 he


told
 us
 quote
 in
 terms
 of
 the


integration
 we've
 integrated
 with
 chat


GBT
 and
 our
 intention
 is
 to
 integrate


with
 more
 people
 over
 time.
 Not
 no


specific
 partnership
 to
 announce
 today


but
 you
 can
 think
 of
 it
 as
 more
 coming.


So,
 a
 lot.


>> Okay.
 So,
 the
 street
 pretty
 excited


about
 those
 numbers.
 Steve,
 any
 raw


reaction
 to
 hearing
 that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 need
 to
 go
 through
 the
 quarter.


The
 press
 release
 isn't
 actually
 out
 on


Amazon's
 website.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to
 um


need
 to
 unpack
 with
 it,
 but
 I
 think


Amazon
 just
 gets
 bigger.
 I
 mean,


>> you
 mean
 Apple.


>> Is
 anybody
 I'm
 sorry,
 Apple.
 Is
 anybody


getting
 rid
 of
 an
 iPhone?


>> Is
 anybody
 not
 used
 paying
 for
 storage?


I
 mean,
 I'm
 doing
 both.


>> Yeah,
 but
 I'm
 sure
 those
 analyst


projections
 or
 estimates
 for
 iPhones


like
 they
 went
 up.
 So,
 if
 they
 were


flat,
 then
 it
 would
 be
 just
 fine.
 But,
 I


mean,
 what
 is
 this
 1%
 move
 on?


>> You're
 saying
 it's
 priced
 in
 basically,


Sam?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 priced
 in.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 I
 agree.
 It
 probably
 is
 priced


in.
 I
 am
 really
 happy
 to
 see
 that
 10%


growth
 guidance
 for
 Q4.
 So
 EPS
 185,


revenue
 102,
 services
 revenue
 28.7,


China
 revenue
 14.
 There
 was
 a
 miss
 on


China
 and
 a
 miss
 on
 iPhone,
 which
 is
 not


great,
 but
 the
 guidance
 for
 Q4
 seems
 to


be
 way
 better
 than
 expected.
 Uh
 stock,


you
 know,
 stocks
 basically
 at
 all
 time


highs.
 So
 as
 you
 said,
 Sam,
 it's
 not


that
 big
 a
 deal.


>> And
 you
 know
 what?
 This
 is
 bullish
 for


the
 market
 because
 ultimately
 they're


going
 to
 generate
 more
 profits
 and
 this


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 drag
 on
 the
 S&P.


Apple
 is
 7%
 of
 the
 S&P.
 So,
 it
 is
 very


important


to
 make
 sure
 Apple
 does
 very
 well.
 Uh,


we'll
 get
 some
 more
 coverage
 on
 Apple,


but
 let
 me
 see
 some
 of
 these
 other


stocks.
 Roku
 still
 dumping.
 We'll
 go


deeper
 into
 their
 numbers.
 Not
 the
 best.


Coinbase
 down
 five.
 Cloudflare
 was
 up
 a


little
 bit
 more.
 That
 one's
 taking
 a
 bit


of
 a
 hit.
 Reddit,
 I
 don't
 understand


what
 happened
 today.
 230,
 185,
 now
 back


to
 200.
 Still
 was
 a
 good
 quarter.
 At


Lassen,
 software
 company,
 that's
 up
 7%.


Lumen's
 down
 2%.
 Twilio's
 up
 7.
 rocket


doubledigit
 EPS
 beat
 which
 was
 good.
 Uh


Netflix
 again
 there's
 the
 split.


Everyone's
 been
 waiting
 for
 it.
 I
 mean


how
 much
 easier
 is
 it
 going to
 be
 to
 buy


a
 100
 shares
 of
 Netflix
 now?
 Instead
 of


having
 to
 pay
 $111,000


you
 can
 pay
 $11,000.


Sell
 some
 covered
 calls
 on
 it.
 So
 that's


going
 to
 be
 nice.
 Uh
 but
 you
 got
 Netflix


up
 2%
 and
 then
 Zillow


up
 2%
 as
 well.
 Amazon's
 still
 moving


folks.


She's
 got
 a
 date
 with
 250.


>> Here's
 a
 question.
 Did
 anybody
 buy


anything
 today?


>> I
 took
 advantage
 of
 the
 meta
 dip
 a


little,
 but
 outside
 of
 that
 house,


>> I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 iron.
 That
 was


really
 it.
 I
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 really
 do


anything.
 I
 bought
 meta
 last
 night.
 So,


>> I
 love
 that
 you
 guys
 are
 in
 meta.
 I
 love


it.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 400.


>> Yeah.
 Love
 it.


>> Riot's
 got
 a
 beat
 EPS
 26
 cents
 versus
 13


180
 versus
 172.
 So
 you
 have
 a
 double


digit
 I
 mean
 100%
 beat.
 So
 triple
 digit


beat
 on
 EPS
 for
 Riot.
 This
 is
 another


Bitcoin
 miner
 turn
 data
 center
 company.


Riot
 stock
 after
 hours


up
 5%.
 So
 you
 got
 to
 move
 on
 Riot.
 Let's


hear
 from
 Dan
 Ies
 on
 this
 Apple
 move.


>> Hearing
 from
 Tim
 Cook
 about
 the
 holiday


quarter
 in
 the
 iPhone.


>> This
 stock's
 going
 to
 be
 green.
 I
 mean


ultimately
 if
 you
 look
 at
 that
 guidance


what
 you're
 seeing
 in
 China.
 Remember


this
 there
 was
 only
 one
 week
 of
 iPhone


17
 the
 quarter.
 Everyone's
 focused
 on


December
 and
 that
 that's
 very
 robust
 in


terms
 of
 what
 we're
 seeing
 on
 iPhone


demand
 specifically
 out
 of
 China
 and


then
 you
 look
 at
 what
 I
 believe
 services


you
 know
 massive
 doubledigit
 growth
 look


go
 back
 to
 the
 last
 6
 n
 months
 company


back
 against
 the
 wall
 now
 you
 have
 this


number
 and
 then
 look
 what
 I
 believe


everyone's
 playing
 for
 AI
 you
 look
 what


look
 at
 Amazon
 look
 at
 the
 hyperscalers


you
 see
 what's
 happening
 on


authentication
 you
 we
 see
 on
 orbs
 you


know
 I
 think
 you
 also
 see
 on
 crowd


strike
 and
 some
 of these
 cyber
 security


names.
 Apple's
 going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 AI


party
 and
 that
 I
 believe
 is
 worth
 $75
 to


$100
 a
 share.
 If
 you're
 an
 investor


right
 now,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 pound
 the


table
 moment
 for
 the
 stock.
 Pat


Morehead,
 uh,
 Steve
 Kovak
 reporting


there
 that
 Tim
 Cook
 says
 Apple


Intelligence
 is
 on
 track
 to
 for
 them
 to


deliver
 as
 they
 promised
 next
 year.
 You


combine
 that
 with
 the
 holiday
 season


that
 they're
 projecting
 for
 the
 iPhone.


How
 does
 this
 set
 Apple
 up,
 do
 you


think?


So,
 John,
 it's
 really
 going
 to
 depend
 on


the
 installed
 base
 that
 uh
 can't
 run


Apple
 intelligence.
 And
 as
 we
 progress,


uh
 every
 every
 slip
 of
 Apple


intelligence,
 more
 of
 these
 iPhones
 can


support
 it.
 A
 year
 ago,
 uh
 had
 we
 been


in
 the
 same
 place,
 I
 would
 have
 said
 it


would
 make
 a
 I
 think
 I
 was
 talking
 along


with
 Dan
 Ives
 about
 a
 super
 cycle,
 and


it
 just
 didn't
 happen.
 So,
 I
 don't


>> to
 Sam's
 point,
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 super


cycle
 might
 finally
 start
 to
 get
 priced


in
 and
 that's
 why
 Apple
 is
 making
 a


move.
 Apple
 right
 there
 goes
 green.
 273


from
 263
 to
 273.
 Apple,
 even
 if
 you


don't
 own
 it,
 very
 important
 for
 this


company
 to
 do
 well
 as
 we
 want
 to
 keep


this
 bull
 market
 alive.
 Dexcom,
 this
 is


down
 5%.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 a
 company
 I
 believe


that
 helps
 with
 glucose
 monitoring.
 Uh


they
 have
 a
 beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the


bottom
 7%
 and
 2%
 7%
 EPS
 61
 cents
 versus


57
 2%
 revenue
 1.2
 versus
 1.18
 EPS
 up
 40%


revenues
 up


uh
 a
 decent
 chunk
 it
 looks
 like
 120%.


That
 stock
 however
 is
 flat
 or
 sorry
 is


down.


>> Can
 you
 zoom
 out
 on
 that
 chart?
 Go
 five


years
 real
 quick.
 Wasn't
 Dexcom
 up
 like


a
 lot
 more?


>> Yeah,
 in
 summer
 of
 24
 they
 got
 schmacked


pretty
 bad.
 They
 do
 the
 glucose


monitoring
 for
 diabetes,
 right?


>> Correct.
 Correct.
 They
 do.


>> Wow.
 Amazon.
 She
 wants
 250.


She
 wants
 250.


How
 about
 this?


20.
 At
 some
 point
 in
 2029,


Amazon's
 going
 to
 be
 back
 to
 550
 or
 600.


>> And
 that's
 assuming
 what?
 A
 trillion
 in


revenue.


>> Trillion
 revenue,
 20%
 operating
 margin.


200%
 operating
 income,
 more
 than
 double


Nvidia's
 current
 operating
 income.


Amazon
 was
 2.4
 trillion
 earlier.
 Nvidia


was
 over
 five
 trillion.
 There's
 no


reason
 to
 think
 this
 can't
 become
 $5


trillion
 company
 in
 the
 next
 four
 years.


>> And
 I
 may
 be
 conservative
 with
 that.


>> I
 agree
 with
 you.
 You
 know
 what?
 I'm


happy
 about
 Amazon.
 This
 was
 another


collective
 win
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 About
 a


month
 ago,
 all
 of
 us,
 you,
 me,
 Tanner,


Chris,
 Sam,
 all
 of
 us
 were
 like,
 "This


is
 stupid.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 companies
 on
 the
 planet,
 and


it's
 down
 3%
 year
 to
 date."
 Like,
 this


doesn't
 make
 sense.
 And
 I
 think
 pretty,


this
 was
 a
 pretty
 collective
 effort.
 It


wasn't
 the
 hardest
 in
 the
 world,
 but


still
 to
 get
 through,
 you
 know,
 the
 nuts


and
 bolts
 of it.
 All
 of
 us
 came
 to
 the


conclusion
 this
 is
 a
 buy.


>> You
 know,
 it's
 not
 often
 where
 all
 of
 us


are
 all
 on
 the
 same
 side
 of
 something.


And
 this
 may
 be
 the
 universal
 one.
 I


can't
 think
 of
 anything
 else
 that's


universal.


>> No,
 there's
 one
 more.
 We
 might
 all
 get
 a


lot
 of
 [ __ ]
 for
 it.


>> No,
 BMR.


>> No,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no.


>> Like,
 don't
 put
 me
 in
 that
 bucket.


>> Don't
 put
 me
 in
 that.
 That
 was
 always
 a


trade
 for
 me.


>> I
 I
 stopped
 myself
 out
 of
 my
 position.


>> Like,
 no.
 That's
 you
 guys.
 Not
 today.


Not


>> I
 I
 even
 I
 even
 said
 it
 on
 stream


yesterday,
 like,
 look,
 the
 the
 real


trade
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 crypto
 are
 the


hard
 coins.
 Like
 that
 is
 the
 real
 you're


supposed
 to
 you're
 supposed
 to
 get
 run


over
 under
 the
 bus
 with
 your
 friends,


not
 throw
 them
 under
 the
 bus.


>> I'm
 sorry.
 I
 like
 money
 more.
 Like
 I


don't
 want
 to
 lose
 my
 money.


>> I
 bought
 more
 Ethereum
 and
 more
 BMR


today.


>> All
 right,
 there
 you
 go.
 No,
 but
 in
 all


seriousness,
 BMR,
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens


with
 that.
 That's,
 you
 know,
 more
 crypto


leverage.
 This
 is
 like
 a
 fundamental


company
 and
 I
 think
 we
 did
 some
 work


over
 the
 past
 month
 and
 we
 kind
 of
 came


to
 the
 conclusion
 this
 makes
 sense.
 Wow.


Apple
 alltime
 highs,
 folks.
 275.


>> Let's
 go.
 Looks
 like
 you
 may
 be
 right.


>> I
 thought
 Apple
 was
 going
 I
 thought


Amazon
 was
 going
 to
 250.
 Come
 on.


>> This
 is
 bullish
 the
 stock
 market
 because


think
 about
 what
 I've
 been
 saying
 and


what
 everybody
 else
 has
 been
 saying.
 If


big
 tech
 continues
 to
 get
 bigger,
 it's


going
 to
 drive
 the
 market
 higher,
 which


is
 beneficial
 everything.
 And
 if
 their


product
 offerings
 get
 better,
 that's


going
 to
 create
 productivity
 and


efficiency
 gains
 for
 the
 broader
 market.


And
 you
 could
 have
 a
 scenario
 in
 26


where
 big
 tech
 goes
 higher,
 but
 you
 also


get
 a
 broad
 market
 rally
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So,
 I'm
 starting
 to
 really
 think


S&P
 8000
 next
 year
 is
 not
 crazy.


>> Apple
 276,
 folks.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 own


it.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 own


it.
 I
 think
 Steve
 is
 actually
 the
 only


one
 of
 us
 that
 owns
 this
 one.


>> I'm
 probably
 the
 only
 one
 that
 owns
 it.


>> You're
 probably
 the
 only
 one.


>> I
 technically
 own
 some.
 I
 own
 a
 lot
 of


SP500.
 So,


>> Oh,
 Sam.
 Dude,
 Sam's
 just
 weasling
 out


of
 everything
 today.
 I
 don't
 know
 BMR.
 I


have
 exposure
 to
 Apple.
 He's
 just


>> I
 I
 got
 I
 got
 exposure
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


through
 the
 SB5.


>> Oh,
 but
 I
 mean
 act
 you
 actually
 own


>> No,
 but
 owning
 it
 directly?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 own
 the
 stock.


>> Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


>> I
 I
 used
 to
 I
 used
 to,
 but
 I
 don't
 own


anymore.


>> What
 do
 you
 say,
 Steve?


>> I'm
 in
 all
 of
 it.
 I
 own
 every
 one
 of
 the


Mag
 7
 directly.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 that's
 fair.
 Apple
 right


there
 just
 hit
 277.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 an
 update
 on
 the
 gross


margins
 and
 then
 we'll
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.
 Folks,
 we
 got
 the
 call
 in
 15


minutes
 for
 Amazon


>> assertions
 there.
 How
 much,
 Steve,
 do


you
 expect
 to
 hear
 Tim
 Cook
 talk
 about


that
 on
 the
 call,
 where
 in
 your
 view


does
 that
 factor
 into
 Q4?


>> Yeah,
 that
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


thing
 on
 the
 call.
 So,
 while
 we
 did
 get


guidance,
 uh
 we
 still
 don't
 know
 what


the
 tariff
 impact
 was
 for
 the
 September


quarter.
 We'll
 get
 that
 on
 the
 call.


They
 had
 estimated
 a
 bit
 over
 a
 billion


dollars.
 Um
 so,
 we'll
 see
 where
 that


actually
 fell
 in.
 And
 then
 yes,
 some


guidance
 in
 towards
 the
 impact
 that


they're
 expecting
 uh
 for
 the
 December


quarter.
 Presumably,
 it
 would
 be
 higher


just
 because
 it's
 a
 higher
 volume
 and
 a


bigger
 quarter.
 I
 did
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to


something
 uh
 that
 Patrick
 and
 Dan
 were


talking
 about
 though
 about
 the
 super


cycle
 and
 whether
 this
 is
 AIdriven.
 One


of
 one
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 asked
 uh
 Cook


uh
 about
 the
 17
 cycle
 was,
 you
 know,


what's
 different
 this
 time?
 What
 what


drove
 what
 do
 you
 see
 the
 momentum
 uh


drivers
 as?
 Um
 and
 he
 did
 mention
 Apple


Intelligence
 as
 one
 of
 them
 because
 uh


to
 their
 earlier
 point
 uh
 you
 do
 need


one
 of
 those
 newer
 devices
 um
 in
 order


to
 do
 this.
 So
 if
 the
 Siri
 uh
 upgrade


does
 live
 up
 to
 the
 expectations
 and
 it


does
 uh
 finally
 play
 out
 the
 way
 Apple


has
 promised
 uh
 we
 could
 see
 some
 uh


more
 positive
 momentum
 behind
 there.
 Uh


but
 he
 also
 did
 credit
 things
 like


design
 and
 new
 form
 factors
 and
 things


like
 that
 as
 as
 also
 behind
 this
 as


well.
 Guys,


>> I
 already
 kind
 of
 forgot
 what
 it
 was


supposed
 to
 do.
 Steve,
 thank
 you.


Patrick,
 thank
 you
 as
 well.
 Dan,
 stick


with
 me
 for
 a
 bit.
 Up
 next,
 we're
 going


to
 dive
 deeper.


>> All right,
 so
 those
 gross
 margins
 not


doing
 the
 worst
 either.
 Uh,
 real
 quick,


let's
 get
 this
 Roku
 update
 because
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 still
 wondering


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Roku.
 Here's
 some


coverage
 on
 that.


>> Roku
 moving
 in
 opposite
 directions
 over


time.
 Let's
 get
 back
 to
 Julia
 Bon.


Julia.


>> Yeah,
 Roku,


>> wait
 a
 second.
 Is
 Apple
 at
 280?
 Oh
 my


goodness.


The
 market's
 basically
 making
 a
 new


alltime
 high
 after
 close.


>> Wait,
 where's
 the
 S&P?


>> I
 got
 to
 say,
 are
 you
 ready?


>> Not.


>> Go
 ahead.


>> Higher.


>> Higher.


>> It
 is
 higher.
 68.
 So
 the
 S&P
 closed
 at


680.
 Apple
 alone
 is
 bumping
 it
 up
 $4.


Apple
 and
 Amazon.
 But
 Apple,
 my


goodness.
 281.


Dude,
 I
 think
 it's
 that
 Q4
 guidance.
 I


think
 it
 is
 that
 Q4
 guidance.


>> And
 think
 about
 this.
 What
 if
 Meta


rebounds
 next
 week?


>> Oh,


>> think
 about
 where
 the
 S&P
 goes
 then,


>> that
 would
 be
 beautiful.


>> You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 Like
 Microsoft


sold
 off,
 Meta
 sold
 off.
 If
 they
 rebound


next
 week
 and
 these
 companies
 just
 stay


where
 they
 are,
 keep
 going,
 and
 you
 get


a
 little
 pump
 on
 Nvidia,
 market's
 going


to
 be
 at
 7,000
 next
 week.


If
 so,
 then
 this
 was
 a
 bear
 trap


throughout
 the
 entire
 day.
 I
 mean,
 if
 if


we
 actually
 get
 a
 meta
 rebound
 as
 well.


iPhone
 49,
 Mac
 8.7,
 iPad
 6.95,
 other


products
 9,
 services
 28.7.
 I
 mean,
 the


only
 thing
 that
 missed
 was
 iPhone
 and


guidance.
 I
 guess
 the
 street
 didn't
 have


it
 priced
 in
 282.


>> Bring
 that
 back
 up.
 What
 was
 services?


>> 27.


>> Amazing.


>> Yeah.
 28.7.


>> Amazing.
 I
 mean,
 really
 think
 about


this.
 And
 this
 has
 been
 really
 the
 crux


of
 my
 Apple
 thesis
 for
 a
 while.
 services


came
 out
 of
 nowhere
 and
 they
 basically


built
 what
 is
 now
 in
 excess
 of
 a
 hundred


billion
 revenue
 run
 rate
 business


inside
 of
 their
 company
 over
 the
 past


seven
 eight
 years


>> out
 of
 nowhere.


>> Yes.
 Because
 they


>> and
 that's
 without
 anything
 with


genative
 generative
 AI
 or
 cloud


offerings
 for
 businesses.


>> Yeah.
 they
 when
 you
 have
 the
 distrib
 and


look
 if
 they
 if
 they
 start
 charging
 10


bucks
 a
 month
 or
 20
 bucks
 a
 month
 for


some
 AI
 add-on
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it's


going
 to
 look
 like
 but
 if
 they
 can
 get


you
 know
 a
 couple
 percentage
 points
 of


their
 two
 billion
 in
 uh
 install
 base
 to


convert
 I
 mean


>> or
 if
 they
 just
 increase
 their
 current


services
 package
 by
 four
 or
 five
 bucks


>> yeah
 perfect
 there
 you
 go
 yeah
 a
 five


bucks
 extra
 for
 more
 AI
 services
 yeah


>> yeah
 and
 and
 and
 Rudy
 in
 the
 chat
 high


margins
 on
 services
 as
 well
 and
 then
 Oh,


new
 uh
 I
 mean
 do
 you
 guys
 know
 how
 much


cash
 they
 have
 now?


Have
 the
 new
 number.
 Do
 you
 guys
 want
 to


guess?


>> Is
 the
 new
 stack
 out
 from
 them?
 Hold
 on,


>> Sam.
 You
 want
 to
 guess
 how
 much
 cash
 do


you
 think
 Apple
 has
 now?


>> I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 I'm
 waiting
 for
 250


right
 now.
 I'm
 like
 looking
 at
 the


candle.
 I'm
 waiting.


>> 132
 billion
 in
 cash
 for
 Apple.


>> They
 haven't
 updated
 the
 return
 of


capital
 yet.


I'm
 I'm
 seeing
 it
 on
 one
 of the
 reports


that
 just
 came
 out.
 100
 there
 Bloomberg


was
 reporting
 it.


>> Did
 they
 Did
 they
 say
 what
 they
 did
 on


buybacks
 this
 quarter?


>> Uh
 if
 they
 put
 out
 the
 press
 release,


let
 me
 check.


We
 don't
 have
 it
 yet.
 Amazon
 is
 Did
 we


hit
 250
 yet?
 No,
 we're
 still
 trying
 to


hit
 it.


Didn't
 hit
 it
 yet.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Amazon
 right
 now
 is
 a
 thing
 of


beauty.
 Sam,
 how
 happy
 are
 you?


>> I
 I
 I'm
 ecstatic.
 We
 can
 see
 it
 all
 over


your
 face.


>> I
 can't
 I
 can't
 like
 I
 I
 can't
 I'm
 not


even
 doing
 anything
 right
 now.
 Just
 in


my
 head
 I'm
 like
 just
 celebrating
 like


it's


>> Bro,
 what
 what what
 percentage
 of
 your


port
 is
 Amazon?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 have
 to
 calculate
 right


now.
 But
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 16%.


>> Wow.


>> Today.
 So


>> nice.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 great
 day.
 But
 also


if
 you
 look
 at
 all
 the
 data
 center


stocks
 out
 there
 like
 Nebius
 is
 at
 127


bucks
 after
 hours.
 Iron's
 at
 almost
 60.


Like
 this
 is
 great
 news
 for
 the
 data


center
 companies
 too.
 So
 this
 is
 lifting


all
 ships
 for
 me.
 All
 ships.
 I
 was


actually
 telling
 people
 like
 I
 was
 like


look
 if
 Amazon
 misses
 this
 quarter.
 I'm


going
 to
 crawl
 into
 a
 hole
 tomorrow.


Like
 they're
 just
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be


alive.


>> Well
 to
 be
 honest
 if
 they
 missed
 I


thought
 it
 would
 go
 below
 200
 and
 I


would
 be like
 that's
 a
 buying
 garbage.
 I


the
 conviction


>> I
 think
 most
 of
 us
 have
 such
 conviction


on
 this
 story
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us


would
 have
 salivated
 for
 an
 under
 200


dip
 but


>> they
 delivered.


>> I
 would
 be
 very
 surprised
 if
 they
 went


under
 200
 considering
 the
 marks
 at


alltime
 highs
 like
 that.
 That
 would
 be


insane
 if
 that
 happened.


>> No.
 Did
 someone
 just
 say
 Apple's
 dumping


and
 it's
 down
 from
 280
 to
 278?


>> We
 are
 so
 spoiled,
 bro.
 We
 are
 so


spoiled.
 Apple
 is
 not
 dumping.
 I


wouldn't
 say
 that's
 a
 dump.
 You
 guys
 are


saying
 there's
 Grab
 news.
 I
 don't
 see


any
 Grab
 headlines.
 So,
 if
 you
 guys
 put


in
 the
 chat,


>> but
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 Grab
 headlines,


but
 Monday
 we
 will
 have
 Grab
 earnings
 as


well.
 Um,


okay.
 So,
 we
 got
 10
 minutes
 until
 the


call.
 Apple,
 I
 mean,
 I
 didn't
 expect


280.
 I'll
 say
 that.
 I
 there
 I
 really
 did


not
 expect
 280,
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 That


one's
 going
 green.
 Uh
 we
 do
 have
 a
 head


headline
 from
 OpenAI
 and
 Oracle


Star
 Oh,
 this
 is
 why
 the
 data
 centers


are
 pumping,
 Sam.
 OpenAI,
 Oracle,
 and


related
 digital
 announced
 Stargate
 data


center
 in
 Michigan.


>> There
 you
 go.


There's
 new
 stuff
 every
 day.
 There
 you


go.
 That's
 what's
 helping
 your
 Nebus
 and


your
 core.
 We
 have
 more
 and
 more
 data


center
 sites
 continuing
 to
 expand.
 Apple


281,
 Amazon
 249.
 Uh
 Rockets's
 up
 three.


Western
 Digital
 that's
 up
 10.3.
 That


one's
 doing
 well.
 And
 then
 Cloudflare,


that's
 still
 up
 five.
 Micro
 Strategy


at
 260.
 Meta's
 moving.
 Are
 we
 at
 680
 on


Meta?


Okay,
 it's
 up
 from
 662.


It's
 not
 moving
 crazy,
 but
 672
 is
 nice


to
 see
 this
 after
 hours
 as
 well.
 Meta


like
 completely
 rejected
 the
 200
 day


moving
 average
 when
 it
 bounced.
 Like
 I


thought
 that
 was
 it.
 But


anyways,
 not


>> Meta
 is
 too
 strong
 of
 a
 company.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 the
 big
 Can
 I
 curse
 on
 this
 a?


>> Yeah,
 you're
 good.


>> This
 was
 the
 biggest
 [ __ ]
 move
 down.


Like
 the
 biggest
 one.
 This
 was
 worse


than
 last
 quarter
 when
 I
 flipped
 out


about
 Amazon
 going
 down
 off
 of
 AWS.
 Any


like,
 and
 here's
 where
 I
 get
 really


pissed
 off
 about
 this.
 Everybody
 sold


Meta
 off
 on
 the
 headline
 numbers
 in
 a


millisecond
 without
 actually
 hearing
 the


earnings
 call
 or
 reading
 through
 the


report.
 The
 cash
 flow
 statement
 showed
 a


thing
 of
 beauty.
 It
 was
 a
 one-time
 tax


charge
 of
 16
 billion
 non-cash
 and
 the


CEO
 CFO
 Susan
 Lee
 actually
 said
 on
 the


earnings
 call
 this
 is
 going
 to
 help
 them


in
 Q4
 and
 for
 years
 to
 come.
 So
 it
 was


the
 biggest
 [ __ ]
 move
 down.


Yeah,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 don't


understand
 why
 the
 street's
 punching


Meta
 for
 all
 this,
 but
 nonetheless,


>> because
 they
 look
 at
 they
 missed
 on
 EPS


by
 $5.50


instead
 of
 reading
 a
 cash
 flow
 statement


and
 showing
 that
 even
 though
 capex


increased
 by
 three
 billion,
 cash
 from


operations
 and
 free
 cash
 flow
 increased


by
 a
 billion.
 So,


>> agreed.
 And
 and
 also,
 I
 mean,
 Meadow
 was


up
 35%
 year
 to
 date.
 I
 mean
 the
 street


probably
 wanted
 a
 reason
 to
 take
 it
 down


but
 every
 price
 target
 I
 saw
 this


morning
 got
 an
 upgrade.
 I
 mean
 there


were
 a
 couple
 downgrades
 but
 pretty
 much


everyone
 has
 them
 at
 1100
 you
 know
 900


to
 1100.
 So


>> I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 laugh
 at
 Meta
 in


a
 year
 from
 now.
 I
 don't
 think
 Meta
 is


going
 to
 be
 stuck
 at
 670.
 They're
 just


grow
 again.
 These
 companies,
 their
 free


cash
 flows,
 their
 net
 income,
 their


margin,
 their
 ability
 to
 I
 mean
 there's


125
 billion
 of
 demand
 for
 25
 billion
 of


bonds
 that
 Meta
 offer
 today.


>> Like
 5x
 more
 the
 demand
 for
 for


corporate
 debt
 is
 incred
 and
 that
 means


investors
 think
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


other
 places
 to
 put
 their
 cash
 in
 a


safer
 way
 than
 into
 Meta
 that's


investing
 into
 data
 centers.
 So
 I
 think


this
 dip
 gets
 bought.
 I


>> mean,
 think
 about
 it.
 If
 you
 want
 yield,


are
 you
 not
 buying
 metabonds?


>> Agreed.
 And
 are
 you
 really
 afraid?


>> I
 mean,
 what's
 more
 secure
 than
 that?


>> Subscribe.


>> Yeah.
 For
 the
 rate
 of
 return
 you're


going
 to
 get,
 I
 mean,
 obviously
 a
 money


market
 fund
 is
 safer,
 but
 the
 rate
 of


return
 on
 those
 metabonds
 is
 not
 as


unsafe.
 By
 the
 way,
 speaking
 of
 money


market
 funds,
 uh,
 record
 high
 7.42


trillion.
 Last
 week,
 they
 increased
 by


another
 20.6
 billion.


20.6
 billion.
 Apple
 284.


Oh
 my.


Oh
 my.
 Back
 to
 Dan
 Ies
 here,
 but


goodness
 gracious.
 284
 on
 Apple.


>> Uh
 came
 in
 strong
 particularly
 for
 the


cloud
 business.
 Apple
 moving
 well
 into


positive
 territory
 as
 well.
 Now
 up
 4.5%


after
 it
 was
 initially
 down
 three


strength
 overall
 for
 big
 tech
 the
 way


these
 two
 have
 performed
 or
 was
 the
 bar


just
 so
 low
 that
 hey
 they
 did
 okay?
 I


think
 it's
 really
 it
 shows
 the
 big
 tech


if
 you
 look
 demand
 it's
 spreading.
 I


mean
 for
 Apple
 the
 China
 story


especially
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 the
 forecast


that's
 extremely
 bullish
 in
 terms
 of


that
 China
 piece
 and
 then
 you
 look
 at


the
 Amazon
 they're
 on
 the
 outside


looking
 in
 relative
 to
 what
 Redmond's


doing
 what
 Google's
 doing
 hypers
 scale
 I


mean
 look
 at
 those
 AWS
 numbers
 I
 mean


that
 shows
 anyone
 that
 had
 doubts
 in


terms
 of
 AI
 is
 it
 a
 bubble
 look
 at
 the


spending
 look
 at
 that
 capbacks
 and
 this


is
 enough
 to
 erase
 the
 doubt
 I
 mean
 it's


20%
 not
 not
 to
 you
 know
 look
 down
 down


the
 nose
 20%.
 But
 some
 of
 the
 smaller


players
 have
 been
 up
 more
 than
 that.
 20%


is
 enough
 at
 AWS's
 scale
 to
 answer


doubters.


>> Well,
 it's
 my
 view
 like
 Jasse
 is
 an
 AWS


guy
 and
 I
 think
 everyone
 counted
 them


out.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 them
 showing,
 hey,


don't
 count
 us
 out.
 You
 look
 at
 demand,


you
 have
 trillions
 that's
 going
 to
 be


spent
 over
 the
 coming
 years.
 They
 do


have
 the
 biggest
 when
 you
 look
 at
 AWS


from
 a
 customer
 base
 perspective.
 And


then
 you
 actually
 start
 to
 look
 at
 what


Microsoft,
 what
 Google,
 what
 what
 we're


seeing
 across
 the
 board.
 This
 shows
 that


that
 AI
 revolution
 theme,
 it's


spreading,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 think
 what


that's
 going
 to
 mean
 authentication,


that's
 going
 to
 mean
 cyber
 security.


That's
 going to
 mean
 the
 use
 cases.
 And


I
 think
 as
 a
 tech
 bull,
 you
 go
 into
 this


weekend
 more
 bullish
 on
 AI
 rather
 than


less
 bullish
 relative
 to
 these
 techn


despite
 Meta
 selling
 off
 which
 I
 view
 as


a
 table
 bounder.


>> Bit
 of
 a
 day
 tant
 between
 Trump
 and
 she


the
 US
 and
 China
 today.
 What
 does
 that


mean
 for
 Apple?


>> I
 mean
 to
 me
 like
 look,
 Cook's
 on
 the


right
 side
 of
 it,
 right?
 I
 mean
 playing


nice
 in
 the
 sandbox
 in
 the
 beltway.
 I


think
 that's
 very
 bullish
 relative
 to


any
 worries
 about
 supply
 chain
 issues,


relative
 to
 to
 Apple
 in
 China,
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 they're
 doing
 from
 an
 India


perspective.
 Look,
 comes
 down
 to
 Cook


10%
 politician,
 90%
 CEO.
 And
 you
 and
 you


start
 to
 think
 about
 what's
 happening
 on


the
 China
 story.
 That
 to
 me
 is
 a
 green


light
 because
 now
 the
 runways
 there,


rare
 earththing
 kicked
 down,
 you
 have


the
 trade
 framework
 out
 there.
 It's
 very


strong
 for
 big
 tech,
 strong
 for
 names


like
 Apple
 with
 the
 exposure
 of
 China,


names
 like
 Tesla
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 the
 overall
 theme
 here
 is


that
 now
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 Amazon,


Apple
 get
 into
 I
 think
 second,
 third,


fourth
 derivative
 starting
 to
 play
 out.


It's
 my
 view
 that's
 why
 this
 tech
 bull


market,
 two,
 three
 more
 years
 left


relative
 to
 this
 AI
 revolution
 trade.


>> It
 is
 not
 96,
 it's
 89.
 It's
 89.
 Dan,


>> I
 was
 just
 about
 to
 say.
 So
 Dan
 says


two,
 three
 years.
 Steve
 says
 10
 years


last


>> 89,


we
 haven't
 even
 got
 a
 happy
 hour
 at
 4
 PM


yet.


>> Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 if
 that
 officially


uh
 ends
 up
 playing
 out
 right
 here.
 So,


Apple
 and
 Amazon
 still
 moving.
 Apple


28364


and


uh
 Amazon's
 didn't
 hit
 250
 yet,
 but


trying
 to


trying
 to
 get
 there.
 Uh
 Apple
 2834.


>> Yeah,
 we
 got


>> Waiting
 for
 it.
 I
 want
 my
 screenshot.


>> Yeah,
 by
 by
 the
 way
 guys,
 that
 wasn't


Steve's
 audio.
 That
 was
 there.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 there's
 been
 so
 many
 police


around
 today,
 but
 that
 was
 me.
 I
 forgot


to
 mute
 and
 you
 guys
 can
 hear
 all
 the


police
 outside.


>> Popo's
 coming
 after
 you.


>> No,
 it's
 raining
 heavy.
 So,
 I
 think


there's
 probably
 a
 bunch
 of
 accidents


and
 like
 like
 I
 saw
 some
 cars
 that
 were


legit
 like
 almost
 underwater
 as
 there


was
 like
 some
 pretty
 heavy
 rain.


>> I
 can't
 believe
 how
 much
 it
 was
 raining


today.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 It
 was
 It


was
 pretty
 aggressive


and
 that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 it.


>> That's
 Amazon
 making
 it
 rain.
 Sorry,
 I


had
 to
 do
 it.
 I
 had
 to
 do
 it.


There
 you
 go.
 Uh,
 all
 right.
 Amazon
 248.


Uh,
 we
 got
 the
 call
 in
 two
 minutes,
 I


guess.
 Last
 thing
 before
 the
 call
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 updating
 in
 the
 chat
 for


whatever
 else
 happens
 throughout
 the


day.
 Uh,
 Sam,
 what
 are
 you
 expecting


Jasse
 to
 say?
 Do
 you
 think
 he
 needs
 to


say
 anything
 specific?


Um,
 I
 think
 he's
 probably
 gonna
 start


talking
 about
 um
 about
 AI
 growth
 in


terms
 of
 their
 uh
 AWS
 products
 and
 also


I
 don't
 believe
 they
 gave
 they
 give
 I


think
 they
 give
 capex
 guidance
 on
 the


call.
 So
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 important.


Um
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 maybe
 there's
 a
 deal


with
 the
 data
 with
 one
 of
 these
 mining


companies
 or
 one
 of
 the
 neoclouds.
 That


would
 be
 pretty
 interesting
 to
 hear.


>> You
 think
 they
 announce
 a
 deal
 like


that?
 They
 they
 never
 announced
 like
 a


specific
 deal
 with
 anyone,
 but
 like


three
 gigawatt
 capacity
 growth
 is
 pretty


extreme.
 Are
 you
 guys
 doing
 your
 own?


Like
 I
 don't
 know
 who's
 helping
 you.


Like
 that's
 what
 I
 want
 to
 know.
 But
 I


feel
 like
 something's
 going
 to
 happen
 at


some
 point
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 that.
 That's


what
 Amazon
 is
 like
 one
 of
 the
 few


companies
 that
 Mega
 never
 really


announced
 a
 particular
 partnership
 with


one
 of
 these
 miners.
 So
 we'll
 see,
 man.


We
 will
 see.
 That
 that
 would
 be
 crazy
 if


they
 announce
 Iron.
 That
 would
 be


insane.
 Um
 we'll
 see.
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 get
 my
 hopes
 up,
 but
 you


know,
 you
 never
 know.
 You
 never
 know.


>> Okay,
 Steve,
 anything
 you
 think
 Jasse


has
 to
 say
 on
 this
 call?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Um,


I
 think
 a
 big
 thing
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be


data
 centers,
 what
 they
 do
 in


advertising


and
 robotics.


I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 what
 I


want
 to
 see.
 So,
 we'll
 see.
 And
 I
 hope,


look,
 for
 Sam,
 I
 hope
 they
 announce


something
 with
 Iron.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 that'd
 be
 dope.
 Actually,
 you


mentioned
 robotics.
 I'm
 sure
 they're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 that
 one.
 If
 he


gives
 positive
 commentary
 in
 terms
 of


efficiency
 uh
 in
 addressing
 like
 the


layoffs
 they
 had
 with
 like
 replacing


them
 with
 possible
 robots
 or


>> they're
 already
 deploying
 them,
 but
 like


if
 they
 start
 talking
 about
 that,
 then


that
 could
 be
 pretty
 interesting
 for


some
 of
 the
 robotic
 plays.
 Actually,


Stock
 Talk
 is
 in
 um
 GXO.


um
 that
 one
 isn't
 directly


uh
 partnered
 with
 Amazon,
 but
 that
 is
 a


warehouse
 company
 that
 basically
 builds


robots
 or
 uses
 robots
 in
 terms
 of
 their


uh
 warehouse
 pipeline.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.


This
 is
 also
 bullish
 for
 that
 stock,


too.
 So,
 that
 that
 this
 is
 a
 pretty


interesting
 game
 to
 be
 in.
 Dude,
 Iron's


back
 above
 60
 bucks
 right
 now.
 It's


insane.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 hope
 I
 hope
 they
 say
 a
 Nebus


or
 an
 IRA.
 I
 mean,
 dude,
 people
 would
 go


crazy.
 That
 would
 be
 that
 would
 be


insane.


I
 I
 have
 some
 I
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of


cover
 call
 as
 a
 part
 of
 my
 position.
 So,


I'm
 kind
 of
 secretly
 hoping
 they
 don't


do
 that,
 but
 we'll
 see.
 Whatever.
 It
 is


what
 it
 is.


All
 right,
 Amazon
 call.
 Let's
 get
 into


it.
 Uh
 I'll
 be
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 we
 get
 any


other
 updates.
 We'll
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


Apple,
 but
 let's
 get
 into
 Amazon.


Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 our
 Q3
 2025


financial
 results
 conference
 call.


Joining
 us
 today
 to
 answer
 your


questions
 is
 Andy
 Jasse,
 our
 CEO,
 and


Brian
 Oski,
 our
 CFO.
 As
 you
 listen
 to


today's
 conference
 call,
 we
 encourage


you
 to
 have
 our
 press
 release
 in
 front


of
 you,
 which
 includes
 our
 financial


results,
 as
 well
 as
 metrics
 and


commentary
 on
 the
 quarter.
 Please
 note,


unless
 otherwise
 stated,
 all
 comparisons


in
 this
 call
 will
 be
 against
 our
 results


for
 the
 comparable
 period
 of
 2024.
 Our


comments
 and
 responses
 to
 your
 questions


reflect
 management's
 views
 as
 of
 today,


October
 30th,
 2025
 only,
 and
 will


include
 forward-looking
 statements.


Actual
 results
 may
 differ
 materially.


Additional
 information
 about
 factors


that
 could
 potentially
 impact
 our


financial
 results
 is
 included
 in
 today's


press
 release
 and
 our
 filings
 with
 the


SEC,
 including
 our
 most
 recent
 annual


report
 on
 form
 10K
 and
 subsequent


filings.
 During
 this
 call,
 we
 may


discuss
 certain
 non-GAAP
 financial


measures.
 In
 our
 press
 release,
 slides


accompanying
 this
 webcast
 and
 our


filings
 with
 the
 SEC,
 each
 of
 which
 is


posted
 on
 our
 IR
 website,
 you
 will
 find


additional
 disclosures
 regarding
 these


non-GAAP
 measures,
 including


reconciliations
 of
 these
 measures
 with


comparable
 gap
 measures.
 Our
 guidance


incorporates
 the
 order
 trends
 that
 we've


seen
 to
 date
 and
 what
 we
 believe
 today


to
 be
 appropriate
 assumptions.
 Our


results
 are
 inherently
 unpredictable
 and


may
 be
 materially
 affected
 by
 many


factors
 including
 fluctuations
 in


foreign
 exchange
 rates,
 changes
 in


global
 economic
 and
 geopolitical


conditions,
 tariff
 and
 trade
 policies


and
 customer
 demand
 and
 spending


including
 the
 impact
 of
 recessionary


fears,
 inflation,
 interest
 rates,


regional
 labor
 market
 constraints,
 world


events,
 the
 rate
 of
 growth
 of
 the


internet,
 online
 commerce,
 cloud


services,
 and
 new
 and
 emerging


technologies,
 and
 the
 various
 factors


detailed
 in
 our
 filings
 at
 the
 SEC.
 Our


guidance
 assumes,
 among
 other
 things,


that
 we
 don't
 conclude
 any
 additional


business
 acquisitions,
 restructurings,


or
 legal
 settlements.
 It's
 not
 possible


to
 accurately
 predict
 demand
 for
 our


goods
 and
 services,
 and
 therefore
 our


actual
 results
 could
 differ
 materially


from
 our
 guidance.
 And
 now,
 I'll
 turn


the
 call
 over
 to
 Andy.
 Thanks,
 Dave.
 We


saw
 strong
 growth
 across
 our
 business
 in


Q3,
 and
 we're
 reporting
 180.2
 billion
 in


revenue,
 up
 12%
 year-over-year,


excluding
 the
 impact
 from
 foreign


exchange
 rates.
 Operating
 income
 was


$17.4
 4
 billion,
 but
 would
 have
 been


over
 $21
 billion
 if
 not
 for
 two
 special


Q3
 expenses.
 $2.5
 billion
 for
 an
 FTC


settlement
 and
 $1.8
 billion
 for


estimated
 severance
 costs.
 Trailing


12-month
 free
 cash
 flow
 was
 $14.8


billion.
 I'll
 start
 with
 AWS.
 AWS
 is


growing
 at
 a
 pace
 we
 haven't
 seen
 since


2022,
 reacelerating
 to
 20.2%


year-over-year,
 our
 largest
 growth
 rate


in
 11
 quarters.


It's
 worth
 remembering
 that


year-over-year
 percentage
 growth
 is
 a


relative
 term.
 It's
 very
 different


having
 20%
 year-over-year
 growth
 on
 a


$132
 billion
 annualized
 run
 rate
 than
 to


have
 a
 higher
 percentage
 growth
 rate
 on


a
 meaningfully
 smaller
 annual
 revenue,


which
 is
 the
 case
 with
 our
 competitors.


Backlog
 grew
 to
 $200
 billion
 by
 Q3


quarter
 end
 and
 doesn't
 include
 several


unannounced
 new
 deals
 in
 October,
 which


together
 are
 more
 than
 our
 total
 deal


volume
 for
 all
 of
 Q3.
 AWS
 is
 gaining


momentum.
 Customers
 want
 to
 be
 running


their
 core
 and
 AI
 workloads
 in
 AWS
 given


its
 stronger
 functionalities.
 Want
 to
 be


running
 their
 core
 and
 AI
 workloads
 in


AWS
 given
 its
 stronger
 functionality,


security
 and
 operational
 performance.


And
 the
 scale
 I
 see
 in
 front
 of
 us
 gives


me
 significant
 confidence
 in
 what
 lies


ahead.
 I'll
 share
 a
 little
 more
 detail


on
 why.
 It
 starts
 with
 AWS
 having
 much


broader
 infrastructure
 functionality.


Startups,
 enterprises,
 and
 governments


want
 to
 move
 their
 production
 workloads


to
 the
 place
 that
 has
 the
 broadest
 and


deepest
 array
 of
 capabilities.
 AWS
 has


more
 services
 and
 deeper
 features
 within


those
 services
 than
 anybody
 else
 and


continues
 to
 innovate
 at
 a
 rapid
 clip.


These
 are
 key
 building
 blocks
 for


anything
 that
 customers
 want
 to
 create,


and
 they're
 a
 big
 part
 of
 why
 Gardner


has
 named
 AWS
 leader
 in
 its
 strategic


cloud
 platform
 services
 magic
 quadrant


for
 15
 consecutive
 years.


We're
 bringing
 this
 same
 building
 block


approach
 to
 AI.
 SageMaker
 makes
 it
 much


simpler
 for
 companies
 to
 build
 and


deploy
 their
 own
 foundation
 models.


Bedrock
 gives
 customers
 leading


selection
 of
 foundation
 models
 and


superior
 price
 performance
 to
 deploy


inference
 into
 their
 next
 generation


applications.


A
 lot
 of
 the
 future
 value
 companies
 will


get
 from
 AI
 will
 be
 in
 the
 form
 of


agents.
 AWS
 is
 heavily
 investing
 in
 this


area
 and
 well
 positioned
 to
 be
 a
 leader.


Companies
 will
 both
 create
 their
 own


agents
 and
 use
 agents
 from
 other


companies.
 For
 those
 building
 their
 own,


it's
 been
 harder
 to
 build
 than
 it
 should


be.
 It's
 why
 we
 launched
 Strands
 to
 make


it
 much
 easier
 to
 create
 agents
 from
 any


foundation
 model
 that
 builders
 desire.


For
 companies
 who
 successfully
 built


agents,
 they've
 hesitated
 putting
 them


into
 production
 because
 they
 lack


secure,
 scalable
 runtime
 services
 or


memory
 or
 observability
 built


specifically
 for
 agents.
 It's
 why
 we


launched
 Agent
 Core,
 a
 set
 of


infrastructure
 building
 blocks
 that


allowed
 builders
 to
 deploy
 secure,


scalable
 agents.
 Ericson
 used
 Agent
 Core


to
 deliver
 AI
 agents
 across
 their


workforce.
 Sony
 used
 it
 to
 build
 an


Agentic
 AI
 platform
 with
 enterprise


level
 security,
 observability,
 and


scalability.
 And
 Coher
 Health
 is
 using


Agent
 Core
 to
 deploy
 agents
 that
 will


reduce
 medical
 review
 times
 by
 up
 to
 30


to
 40%.


Agent
 Core's
 SDK
 has
 already
 been


downloaded
 over
 a
 million
 times
 and
 our


builders
 are
 excited
 about
 it.
 It's
 an


enabler.


Companies
 will
 also
 use
 others
 agents


and
 AWS
 continues
 to
 build
 many
 of
 the


agents
 we
 believe
 builders
 will
 use
 in


the
 future.
 For
 coding,
 we've
 recently


opened
 up
 our
 agentic
 coding
 IDE
 called


Curo.
 More
 than
 a
 100,000
 developers


jumped
 into
 Curo
 in
 just
 the
 first
 few


days
 of
 preview
 and
 that
 number
 has
 more


than
 doubled
 since.
 It's
 processed


trillions
 of
 tokens
 thus
 far.
 Weekly


activives
 are
 growing
 fast
 and


developers
 love
 its
 unique
 spec
 and
 tool


calling
 capabilities.
 For
 migration
 and


transformation,
 we
 offer
 an
 agent
 called


transform.
 Year
 to
 date,
 customers
 have


already
 used
 it
 to
 save
 700,000
 hours
 of


manual
 effort,
 the
 equivalent
 of
 335


developer
 years
 of
 work.
 For
 example,


Thompson
 Reuters
 used
 it
 to
 transform


1.5
 million
 lines
 of
 code
 per
 month,


moving
 from
 Windows
 to
 open
 source


alternatives
 and
 completing
 tasks
 four


times
 faster
 than
 with
 other
 migration


tools.
 Customers
 have
 also
 already
 used


transform
 to
 analyze
 nearly
 a
 billion


lines
 of
 mainframe
 code
 as
 they
 move


mainframe
 applications
 to
 the
 cloud.
 For


business
 customers,
 we've
 recently


launched
 QuickSlee
 to
 bring
 a
 consumer


AI
 like
 experience
 to
 work,
 making
 it


easy
 to
 find
 insights,
 conduct
 deep


research,
 automate
 tasks,
 visualize


data,
 and
 take
 actions.
 We've
 already


seen
 users
 turn
 monthsl
 long
 projects


into
 days,
 get
 80%
 plus
 time
 savings
 on


complex
 tasks,
 and
 realize
 90%
 plus
 cost


savings.
 And
 for
 contact
 centers,
 we


offer
 Amazon
 Connect,
 which
 creates
 a


more
 personalized
 and
 efficient


experience
 for
 contact
 center
 agents,


managers,
 and
 their
 customers.
 Connect


has
 recently
 crested
 a
 billion
 dollar


annualized
 revenue
 run
 rate
 with
 12


billion
 minutes
 of
 customer
 interactions


being
 handled
 by
 AI
 in
 the
 last
 year
 and


is
 being
 used
 by
 large
 enterprises
 like


Capital
 1,
 Toyota,
 American
 Airlines,


and
 Ryan
 Air.
 These
 are
 real
 practical


results
 for
 customers
 and
 there
 are
 many


more
 examples
 like
 them.
 Because
 of
 its


advanced
 capabilities,
 security,


operational
 performance,
 and
 customer


focus,
 AWS
 continues
 to
 earn
 most
 of
 the


big
 enterprise
 and
 government


transformations
 to
 the
 cloud.
 As
 a


result,
 AWS
 is
 where
 the
 preponderance


of
 company's
 data
 and
 workloads
 reside


and
 part
 of
 why
 most
 companies
 want
 to


run
 AI
 in
 AWS.


To
 enable
 customers
 to
 do
 so,
 we
 need
 to


have
 the
 requisite
 capacity.
 And
 we've


been
 focused
 on
 accelerating
 capacity


the
 last
 several
 months,
 adding
 more


than
 3.8
 gawatts
 of
 power
 in
 the
 past
 12


months,
 more
 than
 any
 other
 cloud


provider.
 To
 put
 that
 into
 perspective,


we're
 now
 double
 the
 power
 capacity
 that


AWS
 was
 in
 2022,
 and
 we're
 on
 track
 to


double
 again
 by
 2027.
 In
 the
 last


quarter
 of
 this
 year
 alone,
 we
 expect
 to


add
 at
 least
 another
 1
 gawatt
 of
 power.


This
 capacity
 consists
 of
 power
 data


center
 and
 chips
 primarily
 our
 custom


silicon
 tranium
 and
 NVIDIA.
 We've


recently
 brought
 project
 Rainineer


online
 our
 massive
 AI
 compute
 cluster


spanning
 multiple
 US
 data
 centers
 and


containing
 nearly
 500,000
 of
 our
 tranium


2
 chips.
 Anthropic
 is
 using
 it
 now
 to


build
 and
 deploy
 its
 industryleading
 AI


model
 claude
 which
 we
 expect
 to
 be
 on


more
 than
 1
 million
 tranium
 2
 chips
 by


year
 end.
 Tranium
 2
 continues
 to
 see


strong
 adoption,
 is
 fully
 subscribed,


and
 is
 now
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar


business
 that
 grew
 150%


quarter-over-arter.


Today,
 Tranium
 is
 being
 used
 by
 a
 small


number
 of
 very
 large
 customers,
 but
 we


expect
 to
 accommodate
 more
 customers


starting
 with
 Tranium
 3.
 We're
 building


Bedrock
 to
 be
 the
 biggest
 inference


engine
 in
 the
 world
 and
 in
 the
 long
 run


believe
 Bedrock
 could
 be
 as
 big
 a


business
 for
 AWS
 as
 EC2.
 And
 the


majority
 of
 token
 usage
 in
 Amazon


Bedrock
 is
 already
 running
 on
 Tranium.


We're
 also
 continuing
 to
 work
 closely


with
 chip
 partners
 like
 Nvidia
 with
 whom


we
 continue
 to
 order
 very
 significant


amounts
 as
 well
 as
 with
 AMD
 and
 Intel.


These
 are
 very
 important
 partners
 with


whom
 we
 expect
 to
 keep
 growing
 our


relationships
 over
 time.
 You're
 going
 to


see
 us
 continue
 to
 be
 very
 aggressive


investing
 in
 capacity
 because
 we
 see
 the


demand.
 As
 fast
 as
 we're
 adding
 capacity


right
 now,
 we're
 monetizing
 it.
 is
 still


quite
 early
 and
 represents
 an
 unusual


opportunity
 for
 customers
 in
 AWS.


I'll
 now
 turn
 to
 stores
 where
 the
 team


continues
 to
 deliver
 and
 innovate
 for


customers
 across
 our
 key
 priorities,


selection,
 low
 prices,
 and
 convenience,


particularly
 fast
 delivery.
 We're


offering
 14%
 more
 selection
 since
 last


quarter
 from
 popular
 brands
 like
 the


North
 Face
 and
 Charlotte
 Tilbury.
 And


we've
 added
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


items
 from
 popular
 brands
 this
 year.


Everyday
 Essentials
 continues
 to
 grow


quickly
 and
 year-to-
 date
 is
 growing


nearly
 twice
 as
 fast
 as
 the
 rest
 of
 the


business.
 We
 continue
 to
 make
 it
 easier


for
 customers
 to
 order
 lowpriced


perishable
 groceries
 from
 Amazon.
 And


customers
 in
 more
 than
 1,000
 cities
 and


towns
 now
 can
 shop
 fresh
 groceries


alongside
 millions
 of
 Amazon.com


products
 with
 free
 sameday
 delivery.


This
 is
 a
 gamecher
 for
 customers
 who
 can


now
 order
 milk
 alongside
 electronics,


check
 out
 with
 one
 cart,
 and
 have


everything
 delivered
 to
 their
 doorstep


within
 hours.


The
 team
 also
 invented
 a
 new
 add
 to


delivery
 button
 that
 lets
 customers
 add


items
 to
 previously
 scheduled
 orders
 and


has
 been
 used
 more
 than
 80
 million
 times


since
 launch
 and
 it
 just
 launched.
 It's


an
 example
 of
 one
 of
 those
 seemingly


simple
 but
 powerful
 innovations
 that


make
 customers
 lives
 easier.


We
 remain
 committed
 to
 staying
 sharp
 on


price
 and
 meeting
 or
 beating
 prices
 of


other
 major
 retailers.
 In
 July,
 we
 had


our
 biggest
 Prime
 Day
 event
 ever
 with


customers
 saving
 billions
 of
 dollars


across
 more
 than
 35
 categories.


We
 continue
 to
 break
 records
 on
 speed.


We're
 on
 track
 to
 deliver
 at
 our
 fastest


speeds
 ever
 for
 Prime
 members
 globally


once
 again
 this
 year.
 And
 we've
 started


rolling
 out
 three-hour
 delivery
 in


select
 US
 cities.
 We're
 also
 continuing


to
 invest
 in
 infrastructure
 to
 speed
 up


rural
 deliveries
 and
 serve
 more


customers
 in
 more
 communities.
 That


includes
 committing
 over
 $4
 billion
 to


expand
 our
 rural
 delivery
 network
 across


the
 US.
 These
 are
 small
 towns
 where


people
 want
 fast
 delivery,
 but
 where


other
 companies
 have
 been
 backing
 out


and
 reducing
 service.
 In
 contrast,
 we've


already
 increased
 the
 number
 of
 rural


communities
 with
 access
 to
 our
 same
 day


and
 next
 day
 delivery
 by
 60%.
 reaching


roughly
 half
 of
 the
 total
 communities
 we


plan
 to
 expand
 to
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 The
 stores
 team
 is
 also
 innovating


rapidly
 with
 AI.
 For
 example,
 Rufus,
 our


AI
 powered
 shopping
 assistant,
 has
 had


250
 million
 active
 customers
 this
 year


with
 monthly
 users
 up
 140%


year-over-year,
 interactions
 up
 210%


year-over-year,
 and
 customers
 using


Rufus
 during
 a
 shopping
 trip
 being
 60%


more
 likely
 to
 complete
 a
 purchase.


Rufus
 is
 on
 track
 to
 deliver
 over
 10


billion
 in
 incremental
 annualized
 sales.


Here
 are
 the
 highlights.
 Our
 generative


AI
 powered
 audio
 feature
 that
 combines


product
 summaries
 and
 reviews
 to
 make


shopping
 easier
 has
 expanded
 from


hundreds
 of
 products
 at
 launch
 to


millions
 of
 products
 and
 millions
 of


customers
 have
 used
 it
 streaming
 almost


3
 million
 minutes.
 And
 Amazon
 Lens,
 an


AI
 powered
 visual
 search
 tool
 that
 lets


customers
 find
 products
 with
 their


phone's
 camera,
 a
 screenshot,
 or
 a


barcode,
 now
 includes
 Lens
 Live,
 which


instantly
 scans
 products
 and
 shows


realtime
 matches
 in
 a
 swipeable


carousel.
 Tens
 of
 millions
 of
 customers


are
 using
 Amazon
 Lens
 each
 month.


Moving
 on
 to
 Amazon
 Ads,
 we're
 pleased


with
 the
 continued
 strong
 growth,


generating
 17.6
 billion
 of
 revenue
 in


the
 quarter.
 and
 growing
 22%


year-over-year.


We
 see
 strength
 across
 our
 broad


portfolio
 of
 full
 funnel
 advertising


offerings
 that
 helps
 advertisers
 reach


an
 average
 adup
 supported
 audience
 of


more
 than
 300
 million
 in
 the
 US
 alone.


We
 also
 continue
 to
 be
 excited
 about
 our


demand
 side
 platform
 Amazon
 DSP
 which


lets
 advertisers
 plan,
 activate,
 and


measure
 fullfunnel
 investments.
 Last


quarter,
 I
 mentioned
 our
 partnership


with
 Roku,
 and
 we've
 built
 on
 that
 with


a
 partnership
 with
 Netflix,
 providing


advertisers
 using
 Amazon
 DSP
 with
 direct


access
 to
 Netflix's
 premium
 ad


inventory.
 We
 announced
 integrations


with
 Spotify
 and
 Sirius
 XM.
 With


Spotify,
 we
 provide
 advertisers
 with


direct
 programmatic
 access
 to
 a
 global


audience
 of
 more
 than
 400
 million


monthly
 adup
 supported
 listeners.
 And


with
 SiriusXM,


brands
 can
 reach
 160
 million
 monthly


digital
 listeners
 across
 services
 like


Pandora
 and
 SoundCloud.
 And
 we're


excited
 about
 the
 advertising


opportunity
 around
 Prime
 Video
 Live


Sports.
 Live
 Sports
 got
 a
 lot
 of


interest
 from
 advertisers
 in
 upfront


negotiations
 for
 2025
 26
 and
 we
 exceeded


our
 own
 expectations
 for
 upfront


commitments
 with
 significant
 growth


across
 the
 board.
 Finally,
 we're


continuing
 to
 innovate
 for
 advertisers


with
 AI.
 For
 example,
 in
 September,
 we


announced
 an
 agentic
 AI
 tool
 in
 Creative


Studio
 that
 plans
 and
 executes
 the


entire
 creative
 process
 in
 a
 matter
 of


hours
 instead
 of
 weeks.
 We're
 also


inventing
 and
 seeing
 strong
 momentum
 in


several
 other
 areas,
 and
 I'll
 mention


just
 a
 few.
 In
 Prime
 Video
 Live
 Sports,


NBA
 on
 Prime
 tipped
 off
 last
 week,
 and


our
 opening
 night
 double
 header
 averaged


1.25
 million
 viewers
 in
 the
 US,
 a


double-digit
 increase
 over
 last
 season


on
 cable.
 You'll
 see
 us
 bring
 the
 same


constant
 innovation
 here
 that
 we
 brought


to
 our
 NFL
 broadcasts.
 We're
 adding
 golf


with
 the
 Masters
 in
 2026
 and
 a
 new
 skins


competition
 with
 the
 PGA
 Tour
 on
 Black


Friday
 this
 year.
 And
 we've
 added


Peacock
 and
 Fox
 One
 to
 Prime
 Video's


add-on
 subscription
 offering
 of
 over
 a


100
 channels
 in
 the
 US.


We
 continue
 to
 be
 energized
 by
 the


response
 to
 Alexa
 Plus.
 Compared
 to
 what


we
 call
 the
 classic
 Alexa
 experience,


Alexa
 Plus
 customers
 are
 talking
 to


Alexa
 two
 times
 more.
 Those
 interactions


are
 much
 longer,
 and
 they're
 covering
 a


broader
 range
 of
 topics.
 They're
 using


Alexa
 Plus
 on
 Fire
 TV
 at
 2.5
 times
 the


rate
 of
 classic,
 using
 natural


conversation
 to
 discover
 audio
 content,


four
 times
 more,
 engaging
 with
 photos,


four
 times
 more,
 and
 customers
 are


completing
 four
 times
 more
 shopping


conversations
 that
 end
 in
 a
 purchase.


We've
 expanded
 the
 number
 of
 Project


Kyper
 satellites
 in
 space
 to
 more
 than


150
 and
 delivered
 over
 1
 Gbit
 per
 second


speeds
 and
 tests
 with
 our


enterprisegrade
 customer
 terminal,
 the


first
 commercial
 phased
 array
 we
 know
 of


to
 clear
 that
 threshold.
 Finally,
 Zuk's


robo
 taxis
 are
 available
 to
 riders
 in


Las
 Vegas,
 and
 we've
 announced


Washington
 DC
 is
 the
 eighth
 testing


location.
 We're
 excited
 for
 these
 to


continue
 rolling
 out
 to
 more
 riders.


Q4
 is
 one
 of
 our
 busiest
 and
 most


energizing
 times
 of
 the
 year
 and
 we're


excited
 about
 the
 continued
 demand
 for


AWS,
 the
 innovations
 we'll
 announce
 at


reinvent
 in
 December,
 the
 positive


customer
 response
 to
 our
 AI
 powered


experiences,
 all
 the
 gifts
 we'll
 be


delivering
 throughout
 the
 holiday


season,
 and
 a
 lot
 more.
 Thanks
 in


advance
 to
 our
 teammates
 around
 the


world
 who
 are
 gearing
 up
 to
 deliver
 for


customers
 once
 again.
 With
 that,
 I'll


turn
 it
 over
 to
 Brian
 for
 a
 financial


update.


>> 255,
 baby.
 Starting
 with
 our
 topline


financial
 results,
 the
 worldwide
 revenue


was
 180.2
 billion,
 a
 12%
 increase


year-over-year,
 excluding
 a
 90
 basis


point
 favorable
 impact
 of
 foreign


exchange.


In
 Q3,
 we
 reported
 worldwide
 operating


income
 of
 17.4
 billion.
 This
 operating


income
 includes
 two
 special
 charges


which
 reduced
 operating
 income
 by
 $4.3


billion.


The
 first
 charge
 of
 $2.5
 billion
 is


related
 to
 a
 legal
 settlement
 with
 the


Federal
 Trade
 Commission,
 which
 impacts


the
 North
 America
 segment
 and
 is


recorded
 in
 the
 other
 operating
 expense


line.


The
 second
 charge
 of
 $1.8
 billion


relates
 to
 severance
 costs
 for
 RO


eliminations
 and
 impacts
 all
 three
 of


our
 segments.
 The
 severance
 charge
 is


recorded
 primarily
 in
 the
 technology
 and


infrastructure,
 sales
 and
 marketing,
 and


general
 and
 administrative
 expense
 line


items.


Excluding
 these
 two
 charges,
 worldwide


operating
 income
 would
 have
 been
 $21.7


billion
 or
 $1.2
 billion
 above
 the
 high


end
 of
 our
 guidance
 range.


Moving
 to
 our
 segment
 results,
 we
 remain


encouraged
 by
 the
 innovation
 our
 teams


are
 delivering
 for
 customers
 across
 all


three
 segments.


In
 the
 North
 America
 segment,
 third


quarter
 revenue
 is
 106.3
 billion,
 an


increase
 of
 11%
 year-over-year.


International
 segment
 revenue
 was
 $40.9


billion,
 an
 increase
 of
 10%


year-over-year,
 excluding
 the
 impact
 of


foreign
 exchange.


Worldwide
 paid
 units
 grew
 11%


year-over-year.


We
 continue
 to
 prioritize
 the
 inputs


that
 matter
 most
 to
 our
 customers.
 In


the
 third
 quarter,
 our
 sharp
 pricing,


broad
 selection,
 and
 fast
 delivery


speeds
 continue
 to
 resonate
 with


customers.


Customers
 appreciate
 the
 ability
 to


quickly
 receive
 items
 essential
 for


their
 daily
 needs.
 including
 perishable


groceries
 and
 have
 them
 delivered
 in
 the


same
 day.
 Our
 millions
 of
 global


thirdparty
 sellers
 continue
 to
 be


important
 contributors
 to
 our
 vast


selection,
 which
 helps
 customers
 find


the
 items
 they
 need
 at
 competitive


prices.


We're
 committed
 to
 building
 innovative


services
 and
 features
 for
 our
 sellers,


including
 our
 ongoing
 advancements
 in


generative
 AI.
 Today,
 more
 than
 1.3


million
 sellers
 have
 used
 our
 generative


AI
 capabilities
 to
 more
 quickly
 launch


high-quality
 listings.
 Better
 listings


translate
 into
 better
 traction
 with


customers.
 And
 in
 Q3,
 worldwide


thirdparty
 seller
 unit
 mix
 was
 62%.


Up
 200
 basis
 points
 from
 Q3
 of
 last


year.


Shifting
 to
 profitability,
 North
 America


segment
 operating
 income
 was
 $4.8
 8


billion
 with
 an
 operating
 margin
 of


4.5%.


Excluding
 the
 $2.5
 billion
 charge


related
 to
 the
 legal
 settlement
 with
 the


FTC,


North
 America
 segment
 operating
 income


would
 have
 been
 7.3
 billion
 with
 an


operating
 margin
 of
 6.9%.


North
 America
 segment
 operating
 margin


also
 includes
 a
 portion
 of
 the
 severance


charge.


International
 segment
 operating
 income


was
 $1.2
 $2
 billion
 with
 an
 operating


margin
 of
 2.9%.


Excluding
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 severance


charge
 international
 segment
 operating


margins
 expanded
 year-over-year.


Globally,
 our
 progress
 on
 key
 inputs
 is


delivering
 a
 better
 customer
 experience


while
 driving
 a
 more
 efficient
 cost


structure.


For
 example,
 we're
 making
 notable


strides
 in
 improving
 inventory
 placement


to
 speed
 up
 delivery
 to
 customers.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 for
 the
 third
 year
 in
 a


row,
 we
 are
 on
 track
 to
 deliver
 our


fastest
 speeds
 ever
 for
 Prime
 members
 in


2025.


We
 continue
 to
 tune
 and
 improve
 our


fulfillment
 operations,
 and
 our


regionalized
 network
 is
 operating
 at


scale.
 We
 see
 many
 benefits
 from
 our


inbound
 process
 improvements,
 including


a
 reduction
 of
 US
 inbound
 lead
 time
 by


nearly
 4
 days
 compared
 to
 last
 year.


This
 allows
 us
 to
 be
 more
 efficient
 with


our
 inventory
 purchasing,
 which
 benefits


working
 capital.
 We're
 also
 placing


inventory
 more
 strategically
 throughout


the
 network.
 And
 by
 leveraging
 our


existing
 infrastructure,
 we're
 now


offering
 US
 customers
 the
 ability
 to


order
 perishable
 groceries
 and
 receive


them
 the
 same
 day
 in
 as
 little
 as
 5


hours.
 We're
 seeing
 positive
 early


results.
 Since
 launching
 in
 January,


when
 customers
 start
 shopping
 fresh


groceries
 on
 Amazon,
 they
 are
 visiting


the
 site
 more
 often
 and
 returning
 twice


as
 often
 as
 non-p
 perishable
 shoppers.


Looking
 ahead,
 we
 see
 further


opportunity
 to
 improve
 productivity
 in


our
 global
 fulfillment
 and


transportation
 network.
 We
 will
 continue


to
 improve
 inventory
 placement
 to
 drive


down
 distance
 traveled
 and
 touches
 per


package.
 We
 will
 also
 build
 on
 the
 gains


from
 our
 regionalized
 network
 through


algorithmic
 improvements
 as
 well
 as


launching
 robotics
 and
 automation.


While
 operating
 margin
 may
 fluctuate


quarterto
 quarter,
 we
 have
 a
 deliberate


approach
 to
 achieve
 sustained
 progress


over
 the
 long
 term.


Shifting
 to
 advertising,
 advertising


revenue
 was
 17.7
 billion
 and
 growth


accelerated
 for
 the
 third
 consecutive


quarter.
 We
 continue
 to
 see
 strong


growth
 on
 an
 increasingly
 large
 base
 as


our
 fullfunnel
 advertising
 approach
 of


connecting
 brands
 with
 customers
 is


resonating.


Moving
 next
 to
 our
 AWS
 segment,
 revenue


was
 33
 billion,
 up
 20.2%
 year-over-year.


This
 is
 an
 acceleration
 of
 270
 basis


points
 compared
 to
 last
 quarter,
 driven


by
 strong
 growth
 across
 both
 our
 AI
 and


core
 services
 and
 more
 capacity
 which


has
 come
 online
 to
 support
 customer


demand.


AWS
 revenue
 increased
 $2.1
 billion


quarter-over-arter
 and
 now
 has
 an


annualized
 revenue
 run
 rate
 of
 $132


billion.


AWS
 operating
 income
 is
 11.4
 billion
 and


reflects
 our
 continued
 growth
 coupled


with
 our
 focus
 on
 driving
 efficiencies


across
 the
 business.


We
 are
 expanding
 our
 data
 center


footprint
 largely
 to
 accommodate
 Gen
 AI


and
 to
 the
 extent
 those
 assets
 were


placed
 into
 service,
 the
 related


depreciation
 does
 impact
 our
 margins.


As
 we've
 long
 said,
 we
 expect
 AWS


operating
 margins
 to
 fluctuate
 over


time,
 driven
 in
 part
 by
 the
 level
 of


investments
 we're
 making
 at
 any
 point
 in


time.


Now,
 turning
 to
 our
 cash
 capex,
 which


was
 $
 34.2
 billion
 in
 Q3,
 we've
 now


spent
 $89.9
 billion
 so
 far
 this
 year.


This
 primarily
 relates
 to
 AWS
 as
 we


invest
 to
 support
 demand
 for
 AI
 and
 core


services
 and
 in
 custom
 silicon
 like


tranium
 as
 well
 as
 tech
 infrastructure


to
 support
 our
 North
 America
 and


international
 segments.
 We'll
 continue


to
 make
 significant
 investments


especially
 in
 AI
 as
 we
 believe
 it
 to
 be


a
 massive
 opportunity
 with
 the
 potential


for
 strong
 returns
 on
 invested
 capital


over
 the
 long
 term.


Additionally,
 we
 continue
 to
 invest
 in


our
 fulfillment
 and
 transportation


network
 to
 support
 the
 growth
 of
 the


business,
 improve
 delivery
 speeds,
 and


lower
 our
 cost
 to
 serve.
 These


investments
 will
 support
 growth
 for
 many


years
 to
 come.


Looking
 ahead,
 we
 expect
 our
 fullear


cash
 capex
 to
 be
 approximately
 $125


billion
 in
 2025,
 and
 we
 expect
 that


amount
 will
 increase
 in
 2026.


I'll
 finish
 up
 my
 remarks
 with
 net


income.
 While
 we
 primarily
 focus
 our


comments
 on
 operating
 income,
 our
 third


quarter
 net
 income
 of
 $21.2
 billion


includes
 a
 pre-tax
 gain
 of
 $9.5
 billion


related
 to
 our
 investment
 in
 Anthropic.


This
 investment
 activity
 is
 not
 related


to
 Amazon's
 ongoing
 operations
 and
 is


included
 in
 non-operating
 income.
 We're


encouraged
 by
 the
 start
 of
 the
 peak


season
 and
 we
 are
 ready
 to
 serve


customers
 in
 the
 coming
 months.
 I
 want


to
 thank
 our
 teams
 across
 Amazon
 for


their
 hard
 work
 as
 we
 get
 ready
 to


delight
 customers
 during
 the
 holiday


season.
 Our
 commitment
 to
 elevating
 the


customer
 experience
 is
 the
 only
 reliable


way
 to
 drive
 sustainable
 value
 for
 our


shareholders.
 With
 that,
 let's
 move
 on


to
 your
 questions.


>> Thank
 you.
 At
 this
 time,
 we
 will
 now


open
 the
 call
 up
 for
 questions.
 We
 ask


each
 caller
 to
 please
 limit
 yourself
 to


one
 question.


>> If
 you
 would
 like
 to
 ask
 a


>> All
 right.
 Q&A
 253
 on
 the
 stock.
 Q&A


tends
 to
 move
 the
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


already
 a
 pretty
 big
 big
 move,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 see
 what
 questions
 we
 get
 for


Amazon.


>> Question.
 Please
 press
 star
 then
 one
 on


your
 touchtone
 telephone
 at
 this
 time.


Please
 hold
 while
 we
 pull
 for
 questions.


And
 our
 first
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 Justin
 Post
 with
 Bank
 of


America.
 Please
 proceed.


Great.
 Thank
 you.
 I'll
 ask
 on
 AWS.
 Could


you
 just
 re
 uh
 kind
 of
 go
 through
 how


you're
 feeling
 about
 your
 capacity


levels
 and
 how
 capacity
 constrained
 you


are
 right
 now?
 And
 then
 in
 your
 prepared


remarks,
 you
 mentioned
 Trainium
 3
 demand


and
 and
 maybe
 broadening
 out
 your


customer
 base.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about
 uh
 the


demand
 you're
 seeing,
 you
 know,
 outside


of
 your
 your
 major
 customers
 for


Tranium?
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 on
 the
 capacity
 side,
 uh
 we


brought
 in
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 capacity
 as
 I


mentioned
 in
 my
 opening
 comments.
 uh
 3.8


gawatts
 of
 capacity
 in
 the
 last
 year


with
 another
 um
 gigawatt
 plus
 coming
 in


in
 the
 fourth
 quarter.
 Um
 and
 we
 expect


to
 double
 our
 overall
 capacity
 by
 the


end
 of
 2027.
 So
 we're
 bringing
 in
 quite


a
 bit
 of
 capacity.
 Um
 you
 know
 today


overall
 in
 the
 industry
 maybe
 the
 um


bottleneck
 is
 power.
 I
 think
 at
 some


point
 it
 may
 move
 to
 chips,
 but
 we're


bringing
 in
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 capacity
 and


and
 as
 fast
 as
 we're
 bringing
 it
 in


right
 now,
 we
 are
 monetizing
 it.
 And


then
 on
 the
 tranium
 demand
 uh
 outside
 of


our
 major
 customers.
 So
 first
 of
 all,
 as


I
 mentioned
 on
 Tranium
 2,
 it's
 it's
 it's


really
 doing
 well.
 Um
 it's
 fully


subscribed
 on
 Tranium
 2.
 Uh
 we
 have,
 you


know,
 it's
 it's
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar


business
 at
 this
 point.
 Uh
 it
 grew
 um


150%
 quarter
 over-arter
 in
 revenue.


And
 you
 see
 really
 big
 projects
 at
 scale


now
 like
 our
 project
 Rineer
 that
 we're


doing
 with
 Anthropic
 where
 they're


running
 uh
 their
 next
 version
 of
 they're


trading
 the
 next
 version
 of
 Claude
 on


top
 of
 Tranium
 2
 on
 500,000
 tranium
 2


chips
 going
 to
 a
 million
 tranium
 2
 chips


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Uh
 as
 I


mentioned
 we
 have
 um
 today
 with
 Tranium


2
 we
 have
 a
 small
 number
 of
 very
 large


customers
 on
 it.
 uh
 but
 because
 tranium


is
 30
 to
 40%
 more
 price
 performant
 than


other
 options
 out
 there
 and
 because
 as


customers
 as
 they
 start
 to
 contemplate


broader
 scale
 of
 their
 production


workloads
 moving
 to
 being
 AI
 focused
 and


using
 inference
 they
 badly
 care
 about


price
 performance
 and
 so
 we
 have
 a
 lot


of
 demand
 for
 tranium
 tranium
 3
 should


preview
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 with
 um


much
 fuller
 volumes
 coming
 in
 in
 uh
 the


beginning
 of
 26.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of


customers
 both
 very
 large
 and
 I'll
 call


it
 mediumsiz
 who
 are
 quite
 interested
 in


training
 3.


>> And
 the
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 Brian
 Noak
 with
 Morgan
 Stanley.


>> Thanks
 for
 taking
 my
 questions.
 Uh


congrats
 on
 the
 quarter
 guys.
 So
 maybe


maybe
 two.
 Um
 one
 Andy
 sort
 of
 a
 a


philosophical
 chip
 question.
 You
 know,


there's
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 questions


in
 the
 market
 about
 Tranium
 and
 sort
 of


its
 positioning
 versus
 other
 thirdparty


chips.
 So,
 h
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the


the
 key
 hurdles
 with
 Tranium
 3
 need
 to


overcome
 to
 really
 make
 Tranium
 adoption


broader
 to
 your
 point
 on
 the
 last


question
 and
 continue
 to
 to
 drive


Tranium
 as
 opposed
 to
 satisfying
 what


could
 be
 broader
 demand
 with
 third-party


chips
 in
 the
 in
 the
 near
 term?


Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 we're
 we're


always
 going
 to
 have
 multiple
 chip


options
 for
 our
 customers.
 It's,
 you


know,
 it
 it's
 been
 true
 in
 every
 major


technology
 building
 block
 or
 component


that
 we've
 had
 in
 AWS
 really
 in
 the


history
 of
 AWS.
 It's
 never
 just
 one


player
 that
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


has
 the
 entire
 market
 segment
 and
 it
 can


satisfy
 everybody's
 needs
 on
 every


dimension.
 And
 so,
 we
 have
 a
 very
 deep


relationship
 with
 Nvidia.
 um
 we
 have
 for


a
 very
 long
 time
 and
 we
 will
 for
 as
 long


as
 I
 can
 foresee
 the
 future.
 We
 buy
 a


lot
 of
 Nvidia.
 We
 are
 not
 constrained
 in


any
 way
 in
 buying
 Nvidia
 and
 I
 expect


that
 we'll
 continue
 to
 buy
 more
 Nvidia


um
 both
 next
 year
 and
 in
 the
 future.
 But


we're
 different
 from
 most
 technology


companies
 in
 that
 we
 have
 our
 own
 very


strong
 chip
 team.
 Um
 and
 this
 is
 our


Annaperna
 team.
 And
 you
 saw
 it
 first
 on


the
 CPU
 side
 with
 what
 we
 built
 with


Graviton,
 which
 is
 about
 40%
 better


price
 performance
 than
 the
 other
 x86


processors.
 And
 you're
 seeing
 it
 again


on
 the
 custom
 silicon
 on
 the
 AI
 side


with
 Tranium,
 which
 is
 about
 the
 same


amount
 of
 price
 performance
 benefit
 for


customers
 relative
 to
 other
 GPU
 options.


And
 you
 know,
 our
 our
 customers
 to
 be


able
 to
 use
 AI
 as
 expansively
 as
 they


want.
 And
 remember,
 it's
 still


relatively
 early
 days
 at
 this
 point.


They
 they're
 going
 to
 need
 better
 price


performance
 and
 they
 care
 about
 it


deeply.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 the
 momentum
 that


tranium
 2
 has.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 for
 us


as
 we
 think
 about
 tranium
 3,
 I
 expect


tranium
 3
 will
 be
 about
 40%
 better
 than


tranium
 2.
 And
 trrenium
 2
 is
 already


very
 uh
 advantaged
 on
 price
 performance.


So,
 we
 have
 to
 of
 course
 deliver
 the


chip.
 We
 have
 to
 deliver
 it
 in
 volumes


and
 deliver
 it
 quickly.
 And
 we
 have
 to


you
 know
 continue
 to
 work
 on
 the


software
 ecosystem
 which
 gets
 better
 all


the
 time.
 And
 as
 we
 have
 more
 proof


points
 like
 we
 have
 with
 project
 rainer


with
 with
 what
 anthropics
 is
 doing
 on


tranium
 2
 it
 builds
 increasing


credibility
 for
 tranium
 and
 I
 think


customers
 are
 very
 bullish
 about
 it.
 I'm


bullish
 about
 it
 as
 well.
 Guys,
 Amazon


capex
 guide
 is
 125.


>> And
 our
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of


>> 125
 billion
 for
 next
 year.
 That's
 what


the
 CFO
 just
 said.


>> Question.


>> Thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 question.
 Um,
 I'll


stick
 with
 uh
 basically
 the
 same
 topic,


Andy.
 Um
 but
 can
 you
 just
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 about
 the
 architecture
 of
 project


reneer
 and
 how
 it's
 differentiated


um
 and
 you
 know
 what
 that
 means
 for


customers
 and
 for
 AWS
 and
 do
 you
 expect


Reneer
 to
 expand
 beyond
 anthropic
 and


how
 do
 you
 replicate
 Reneer
 with
 uh


tranium
 3
 chips?
 Thanks.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 uh
 what
 is
 compelling
 for


anthropic
 around
 uh
 project
 rainer
 is


you
 know
 really
 is
 the
 the
 tranium
 2


chip
 which
 um
 you
 know
 we
 built
 a
 very


first
 of
 all
 we
 built
 a
 very
 large


cluster
 that
 they
 can
 use
 in
 a
 very


expansive
 way
 and
 it's
 not
 simple
 to
 be


able
 to
 build
 a
 cluster
 that
 has
 500,000


plus
 chips
 going
 to
 a
 million
 that's


that's
 an
 infrastructure


uh
 feat
 that
 that's
 hard
 to
 do
 at
 scale


and
 So
 you
 know
 some
 piece
 of
 it
 is
 the


infrastructure
 capabilities
 that
 we've


built
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 in
 AWS


that
 is
 you
 know
 unusual
 in
 the
 in
 the


industry
 but
 it's
 just
 also
 the


performance
 of
 the
 chip
 and
 uh
 and
 the


price
 performance
 which
 both
 of
 which


matter
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you


know
 project
 reineer
 is
 something
 that


um
 is
 specific
 for
 anthropic
 but
 we
 have


a
 lot
 of
 other
 customers
 who
 are


interested
 in
 employing
 large
 cluster


ers
 of
 tranium
 chips
 that
 we're
 going
 to


hopefully
 give
 them
 a
 chance
 to
 do
 so


with
 tranium
 3.


>> And
 the
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 Mark
 Mahaney
 with
 Evercore
 ISI.


Please
 proceed
 with
 your
 question.


>> Thanks.
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 about
 two
 topics,


groceries
 and
 then
 how
 to
 think
 about


headcount
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 on


groceries,
 I
 want
 to
 the
 the


perishables.
 I
 think
 last
 quarter
 you


talked
 about
 70%
 or
 something
 of
 users


had
 never
 purchased
 from
 par
 perishables


from
 Amazon
 before.
 Just
 talk
 about


whether
 you
 you
 know
 I
 think
 you
 used


the
 term
 gamecher
 before.
 Does
 this
 mean


that
 maybe
 we
 don't
 not
 you
 no
 longer


need
 to
 do
 Amazon
 fresh
 stores?
 you


always
 had
 this
 DVD
 delivery
 van
 density


advantage
 and
 um
 have
 you
 kind
 of


reached
 a
 point
 you
 think
 of
 scale
 and


speed
 that
 you
 really
 can
 change
 people


uh
 habit
 and
 really
 have
 them
 consider


Amazon
 as
 one
 of
 their
 first
 grocery


options
 do
 you
 really
 feel
 like
 you're


at
 that
 point
 and
 then
 secondly
 just
 on


the
 headcount
 given
 some
 of the
 recent


news
 just
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 um
 how
 you


think
 about
 headcount
 going
 forwards
 are


you
 seeing
 uh
 the
 is
 the
 level
 of


efficiencies
 that
 you're
 getting
 from
 AI


such
 that
 uh
 you
 can
 keep
 headcount


relatively
 flattish
 for
 the
 foreseeable


future.
 Just
 talk
 about
 the
 um
 the
 the


the
 pros
 and
 cons
 or
 the
 wins
 and
 losses


in
 terms
 of
 that
 that
 headcount
 going


forwards.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 I'll
 start
 with
 grocery.


Mark,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 a
 very
 large


grocery
 business.
 You
 know,
 if
 if
 you


look
 at
 our
 entire
 grocery
 business,
 if


I
 don't
 even
 count
 Whole
 Foods
 Market


and
 Fresh
 in
 the
 last
 12
 months,
 it's


over
 a hundred
 billion
 dollars
 of
 gross


merchandising
 sales,
 which
 would
 make
 us


a
 top
 three
 grocery
 in
 the
 US.
 A
 a
 good


chunk
 of
 it
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 items
 that


you'd
 find
 in
 the
 middle
 aisles.
 So,


consumables
 and
 canned
 goods
 and
 pet


food
 and
 health
 and
 beauty.
 Uh
 very


significant
 that
 continues
 to
 grow
 at
 a


very
 good
 clip.
 But
 then
 you
 know
 we


also
 have
 Whole
 Foods
 Market
 which
 is


the
 pioneer
 in
 organic
 foods
 which
 is


also
 growing
 at
 a
 faster
 clip
 than
 most


grocery
 companies
 and
 with
 an
 attractive


trajectory
 on
 profitability.
 And
 we'll


expand
 our
 Whole
 Foods
 physical
 presence


um
 over
 the
 coming
 years
 here.
 And
 I'm


also
 very
 excited
 about
 this
 new
 concept


daily
 shop
 that
 we
 have
 which
 is
 a


smaller
 version
 of
 Whole
 Foods
 in
 urban


settings
 which
 um
 we
 have
 three
 that


we've
 launched
 that
 are
 off
 to
 very
 good


starts
 that
 you
 should
 expect
 to
 see


more
 of
 as
 well.
 Now,
 we
 have
 always


been,
 you
 know,
 as
 as
 you
 referenced,


we've
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 having
 a
 a
 a


larger
 mass
 physical
 presence,
 and
 we


continue
 to
 experiment
 with
 various


formats,
 but
 the
 one
 that
 we
 are
 most


excited
 about
 is
 is
 what
 you
 referenced,


which
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 provide


perishable
 groceries
 with
 same
 day


deliveries.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 how


many
 of
 our
 customers
 are
 buying
 from
 us


multiple
 times
 a
 week
 and
 um
 who
 are


buying
 things
 like
 shampoo
 or
 detergent


or
 paper
 cups
 or
 water
 where
 the
 ability


to
 add
 milk
 and
 eggs
 and
 yogurt
 and


other
 perishables
 to
 their
 order
 and


have
 it
 show
 have
 it
 live
 in
 the
 same


shopping
 cart
 then
 show
 up
 a
 few
 hours


later
 is
 very
 compelling.
 And
 we
 started


with
 a
 few
 markets
 about
 a
 year
 ago
 and


we
 were
 really
 taken
 aback
 at
 the


adoption.
 Not
 just
 the
 number
 of
 people


that
 started
 buying
 perishables
 from
 us


very
 quickly,
 but
 how
 often
 they
 came


back
 downstream
 to
 buy
 perishables
 and


groceries
 from
 us
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 so


we've
 now
 expanded
 that
 to
 a
 thousand


cities
 around
 the
 US.
 Um
 we'll
 be
 in


2,300
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 And
 it's


really
 changing
 the
 trajectory
 and
 the


size
 of
 our
 grocery
 business.
 And
 I
 I


also
 believe
 that
 this
 many
 years


tradition
 of
 the
 weekly
 stock
 up
 uh


grocery
 stock
 up
 is
 changing
 and
 I
 think


we're
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that
 and
 and
 and
 I
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 potential
 there


for
 the
 grocery
 side.
 It
 doesn't
 mean


that
 we
 won't
 continue
 to
 experiment


with
 with
 other
 physical
 formats,
 but


we're
 on
 to
 something
 very
 significant


with
 what
 we're
 doing
 with
 perishables


from
 our
 same
 day
 facilities.
 And
 then


on
 your
 headcount
 question,


you
 know
 what
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 is,
 you


know,
 the
 um
 the
 announcement
 that
 we


made
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 was
 not
 really


financially
 driven
 and
 it's
 not
 even


really
 AI
 driven.
 Um
 not
 not
 right
 now


at
 least.
 It's
 it
 it
 really
 it's
 culture


and
 if
 you
 grow


uh
 as
 fast
 as
 we
 did
 for
 several
 years,


you
 know,
 the
 size
 of
 businesses,
 the


number
 of
 people,
 the
 number
 of


locations,
 the
 types
 of
 businesses


you're
 in,
 you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 lot
 more


people
 than
 what
 you
 had
 before
 and
 you


end
 up
 with
 a
 lot
 more
 layers.
 And
 when


that
 happens,
 you
 know,
 sometimes


without
 realizing
 it,
 you
 can
 weaken
 the


ownership
 of
 the
 people
 that
 you
 have


who
 are
 doing
 the
 actual
 work
 and
 who


own
 most
 of
 the
 two-way
 door
 decisions,


the
 ones
 that
 should
 be
 be
 made
 quickly


and
 right
 at
 the
 front
 line.
 And
 it
 and


it
 can
 lead
 to
 slowing
 you
 down.
 And
 as


a
 leadership
 team,
 we
 are
 committed
 to


operating
 like
 the
 world's
 largest


startup.
 And
 we're
 that
 means
 removing


layers.
 It
 means
 increasing
 the
 amount


of
 ownership
 that
 people
 have.
 And
 it


means
 inventing
 and
 moving
 quickly.
 And


I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 ever
 been
 a
 time


in
 the
 history
 of
 of
 Amazon
 or
 or
 maybe


business
 in
 general
 with
 the
 the


technology
 transformation
 have
 happening


right
 now
 where
 it's
 important
 to
 be


lean,
 it's
 important
 to
 be
 flat,
 and


it's
 important
 to
 move
 fast.
 And
 that's


what
 we're
 going
 to
 do.


>> And
 the
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 Eric
 Sheridan
 with
 Goldman


Sachs.
 Please
 proceed
 with
 your


question.


Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the
 question.


Wanted
 to
 know
 Andy
 if
 you
 could
 reflect


on
 the
 opportunity
 that's
 continuing
 to


present
 itself
 in
 terms
 of
 rolling
 out


more
 robotics
 and
 automation
 and
 the


broader
 theme
 of
 physical
 AI
 across
 your


operations
 and
 how
 you
 should
 be


thinking
 about
 that
 as
 a
 driver
 of


potential
 efficiencies
 but
 also
 as
 a


driver
 of
 the
 ability
 to
 possibly


reinvest
 back
 in
 the
 business
 over
 the


long
 term.
 Thanks
 so
 much.


Robotics
 is
 a
 a
 very
 substantial
 area
 of


investment
 for
 us.
 Um
 we
 have
 over
 a


million
 robots
 in
 our
 fulfillment


network
 at
 this
 point.
 Uh
 and
 I
 would


say
 that
 um
 while
 that's
 significant,
 we


have
 a
 lot
 of
 invention
 in
 flight.
 Um
 so


I
 expect
 that
 we'll
 have
 more
 over
 a


period
 of
 time.
 Uh
 you
 know
 robotics
 are


very
 important
 for
 us
 and
 for
 our


customers
 and
 for
 our
 our
 teammates


because
 they
 improve
 safety.
 um
 they


boost
 productivity,
 they
 um
 increase


speed
 and
 they
 and
 they
 let
 our
 our


human
 teammates
 focus
 on
 problem
 solving


and
 what
 they
 do
 best.
 And
 we
 expect


that
 our
 our
 people
 remain
 at
 the
 heart


and
 the
 center
 of
 our
 fulfillment


network
 as
 they
 have
 from
 when
 we
 first


started
 working
 on
 robotics.
 And
 we


expect
 that
 over
 time
 we
 will
 have
 a


fulfillment
 network
 where
 robots
 and


humans
 complement
 each
 other
 and
 work


together.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 see
 us
 invest
 uh
 invest
 very


significantly
 in
 robotics.
 It's
 going
 to


help
 on
 the
 safety,
 the
 productivity,


the
 speed,
 and
 ultimately
 some
 of
 the


cost
 pieces
 which
 will
 allow
 us
 to


continue
 to
 improve
 the
 customer


experience.


>> And
 the
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 John
 Blackedledge
 with
 TD
 Cowan.


Please
 proceed
 with
 your
 question.


>> Uh
 great.
 Uh
 thank
 you.
 uh
 how
 does


Amazon
 think
 about
 agentic
 commerce


going
 forward
 and
 how
 do
 you
 think
 uh


Amazon
 will
 serve
 customers
 using
 agents


to
 purchase
 goods
 on
 Amazon
 in
 the


future?
 Thank
 you.


>> I'm
 very
 excited
 about
 uh
 and
 and
 as
 a


business
 we're
 very
 excited
 about
 in
 the


long
 term
 the
 prospect
 of
 Aante
 Commerce


and
 it
 has
 a
 chance
 to
 be
 good
 for


customers.
 has
 a
 chance
 to
 be
 really


good
 for
 e-commerce
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think


if
 you're
 if
 you
 know
 what
 you
 want
 to


buy
 there
 are
 few
 experiences
 that
 are


better
 than
 coming
 to
 Amazon
 but
 if
 you


don't
 know
 what
 you
 want
 it's
 you
 know
 a


physical
 store
 with
 a
 physical


salesperson
 still
 has
 some
 advantages


obviously
 lots
 of
 people
 do
 it
 on
 Amazon


all
 the
 time
 but
 you
 very
 often
 want
 to


ask
 questions
 and
 help
 you
 know
 get
 help


narrowing
 what
 you're
 going
 to
 look
 for


and
 as
 you
 keep
 asking
 new
 questions


having
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 different


options
 presented
 to
 you.
 And
 I
 think
 AI


and
 agentic
 commerce
 are
 are
 going
 to


change
 the
 experience
 online
 where
 that


experience
 where
 you're
 narrowing
 what


you
 want
 when
 you
 don't
 know
 is
 going
 to


get
 better
 online
 than
 it
 even
 is
 um
 in


physical
 uh
 um
 environments.
 Now
 we


obviously
 have
 our
 own
 efforts
 here
 in


Agentic
 Commerce.
 We
 have
 Rufus,
 which
 I


talked
 about
 in
 my
 opening
 comments,


which
 is
 continuing
 to
 get
 better
 and


better
 and
 used
 more
 broadly.
 And
 we


have
 features
 like
 buy
 for
 me
 where
 we


will
 surface
 uh
 on
 Amazon
 even
 items


that
 we
 don't
 stock
 that
 other
 merchants


have
 and
 then
 if
 customers
 want
 us
 to
 go


and
 buy
 it
 for
 them
 on
 those
 um


merchants
 websites
 we
 will
 do
 that.
 Um


and
 both
 of
 those
 have
 been
 successful


for
 us.
 But
 we're
 also
 um
 you
 know


having
 conversations
 with
 and
 expect


over
 time
 to
 partner
 with
 thirdparty
 a


uh
 um
 agents.
 And
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that


um
 it
 reminds
 me
 in
 some
 ways
 of
 the


beginning
 of
 uh
 search
 engines
 many


years
 ago
 being
 sources
 of
 discovery
 for


commerce.
 And
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 had
 to


kind
 of
 figure
 out
 the
 right
 way
 to
 work


together.
 And
 today,
 search
 engines
 are


a
 very
 small
 part
 of
 um
 our
 referral


traffic
 and
 third
 party
 agents
 are
 a


very
 small
 subset
 of
 that.
 But
 I
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 we
 will
 find
 ways
 to
 partner.


We
 have
 to
 find
 a
 way
 though
 that
 makes


the
 the
 customer
 experience
 um
 good.
 You


know,
 right
 now
 I
 would
 say
 the
 customer


experience
 is
 not
 good.
 There's
 there's


no
 personalization.
 There's
 no
 shopping


history.
 The
 delivery
 estimates
 are


frequently
 wrong.
 The
 prices
 are
 often


wrong.
 So,
 we
 we've
 got
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


to
 make
 the
 customer
 experience
 better


and
 have
 the
 right
 exchange
 of
 value.


But,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 um
 the
 exciting


part
 of
 this
 and
 the
 promise
 is
 that
 AI


and
 Aentic
 um
 commerce
 solutions
 are


going
 to
 expand
 the
 amount
 of
 shopping


that
 happens
 online.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 good
 for
 customers
 and
 I
 think


it's
 really
 good
 for
 Amazon
 because
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day,
 you're
 going
 to
 buy


from
 the
 outfit
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 have


the
 broadest
 selection,
 great
 value,
 and


continues
 to
 deliver
 for
 you
 very


quickly
 and
 reliably.
 And
 and
 I
 think


that
 bodess
 well
 for
 us.


>> And
 our
 final
 question
 comes
 from
 the


line
 of
 Colin
 Sebastian
 with
 Baird.


Please
 proceed
 with
 your
 question.


Uh
 thanks
 uh
 good
 afternoon.
 I
 guess


first
 on
 AWS
 um
 following
 up
 there
 um


how
 much
 of
 this
 acceleration
 is
 is


driven
 by
 core
 infrastructure
 versus
 AI


workload
 monetization
 and
 I
 I
 think
 part


of
 it
 is
 trying
 to
 understand
 how


important
 newer
 services
 like
 agent
 core


are
 becoming
 in
 in
 bringing
 enterprises


to
 AWS
 to
 build
 agents.
 Um
 and
 then
 I


guess
 secondly
 regarding
 the


acceleration
 in
 advertising
 um
 if
 you


could
 potentially
 disagregate
 the
 core


advertising
 um
 contribution
 versus
 DSPM


prime
 video
 that
 would
 be
 helpful
 as


well.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 start
 on
 the
 AWS
 side.


Uh
 you
 know
 we
 are
 seeing
 you
 know
 uh
 it


you
 know
 we're
 really
 pleased
 with
 the


results
 from
 this
 quarter.
 um
 20%


year-over-year
 on
 a
 annualized
 run
 rate


of
 $132
 billion
 is
 is
 unusual
 and
 uh
 we


we
 we
 have
 momentum
 uh
 and
 you
 can
 see


it
 uh
 and
 we
 we
 see
 the
 growth
 in
 um
 you


know
 both
 our
 our
 um
 our
 AI
 area
 where


um
 we
 see
 it
 in
 a
 in
 uh
 inference,
 we


see
 it
 in
 training,
 we
 see
 it
 in
 um
 the


use
 of
 um
 our
 uh
 trainium
 custom
 silicon


um
 you
 know
 bedrock
 continues
 to
 grow


really
 quickly.
 Um
 Sage
 Maker
 continues


to
 grow
 quickly
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think


that
 the
 um
 the
 number
 of
 companies
 who


are
 working
 on
 building
 agents
 is
 very


significant.
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 a
 lot
 of


the
 value
 that
 companies
 will
 realize


over
 time
 and
 AI
 will
 come
 from
 agents.


And
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 building
 agents


today
 is
 still
 harder
 than
 it
 should
 be.


Um
 you
 you
 need
 tools
 to
 make
 it
 easier,


which
 is
 why
 we
 built
 Strands,
 which


which
 is
 a
 an
 open-
 source
 capability


that
 lets
 people
 build
 agents
 from
 any


model
 that
 they
 can
 imagine.
 But
 even


more
 so
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 enterprises
 or


companies
 that
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 security


uh
 and
 scale,
 they
 they're
 starting
 to


build
 agents
 and
 and
 they
 don't
 really


feel
 like
 they've
 got
 they've
 had


building
 blocks
 that
 allow
 them
 to
 have


the
 type
 of
 secure
 scalable
 agents
 that


they
 need
 to
 bet
 their
 businesses
 and


their
 customer
 experiences
 and
 their


data
 on.
 And
 that's
 why
 that
 was
 really


the
 inspiration
 behind
 agent
 core
 was
 to


build
 another
 set
 of
 primitive
 building


blocks
 like
 we
 built
 in
 the
 early
 days


of
 AWS
 where
 it
 was
 compute
 and
 storage


and
 database.
 We
 we
 defined
 a
 set
 of


building
 blocks
 that
 you
 needed
 to
 be


able
 to
 deploy
 agents
 securely
 and


scalably
 um
 that
 we
 provide
 in
 agent


core
 and
 when
 we
 talk
 to
 our
 customers


it
 really
 resonates.
 There
 is
 not


anything
 else
 like
 it.
 is
 changing
 their


time
 frame
 and
 their
 receptivity
 to


building
 agents
 and
 um
 it's
 it's
 very


compelling
 for
 them.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 you


know
 the
 combination
 of
 what
 we're
 doing


to
 enable
 agents
 to
 be
 built
 and
 run


securely
 and
 scalably
 as
 well
 as
 some
 of


the
 agents
 that
 we're
 building
 ourselves


that
 our
 customers
 are
 excited
 about
 are


compelling
 for
 them.
 And
 you
 know
 I


think
 the
 other
 place
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of


growth
 in
 AWS
 also
 you
 know
 is
 just
 the


number
 of
 enterprises


who
 are
 going
 who've
 gotten
 back
 to


moving
 from
 on
 premises
 infrastructure


to
 the
 cloud
 and
 we
 continue
 to
 earn
 the


lion
 share
 of
 those
 transformations


and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 look
 at
 the
 momentum


we
 have
 right
 now
 and
 I
 I
 believe
 that


we
 can
 continue
 to
 grow
 at
 a
 clip
 like


this
 for
 a
 while.
 Um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 on


the
 uh
 advertising
 side


uh
 you
 know
 that
 is
 also
 an
 area
 where
 I


where
 I
 think
 collectively
 we
 feel
 very


pleased
 about
 the
 progress.
 Every
 single


one
 of
 our
 advertising
 offerings
 this


quarter
 grew
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 I


think
 there's
 a
 few
 things
 going
 on
 for


us.
 Um
 we
 have
 what
 I
 think
 of
 as
 a
 as
 a


pretty
 unusual
 fullfunnel
 offering.
 And


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 funnel,


which
 typically
 tends
 to
 be
 awareness


building
 and
 broadscale
 to
 be
 able
 to
 um


to
 use
 our
 our
 own,
 you
 know,
 Prime


Video
 and
 our
 live
 sports
 capabilities


um
 as
 well
 as
 going
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


the
 bottom
 of
 the
 funnel
 at
 point
 of


sale
 being
 able
 to
 use
 sponsored


products.
 Um
 that's,
 you
 know,
 most


people
 don't
 have
 a
 fullfunnel
 offering


as
 robust
 as
 that.
 And
 then
 when
 you


layer
 on
 top
 of
 it
 the
 combination
 of


the
 audience
 curation
 and
 development
 we


can
 do
 along
 with
 the
 advantage


measurement
 it
 just
 all
 leads
 to
 a


return
 on
 advertising
 spend
 that's
 very


unusual
 and
 I
 I
 think
 there
 are
 multiple


places
 where
 we
 can
 expect
 to
 continue


to
 grow
 you
 know
 one
 is
 in
 our
 stores


business
 I
 I
 still
 think
 you
 know
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 worldwide
 market
 segment


share
 of
 of
 retail
 still
 80
 to
 85%
 %
 of


it
 lives
 in
 physical
 stores
 and
 that


equation
 is
 going
 to
 flip
 over
 time
 and


I
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 only
 accelerate


that.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 an
 opportunity


a
 significant
 opportunity
 still
 in
 our


existing
 stores
 and
 then
 I
 think
 video


you
 know
 we've
 only
 been
 at
 this
 for
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time
 but
 it's
 already
 a


very
 large
 amount
 of
 advertising
 revenue


and
 we're
 still
 relatively
 early
 stage.


I
 think
 that
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 a
 big


area
 of
 growth.
 And
 then
 as
 as
 you


referenced
 the
 uh
 the
 amount
 the
 DS


their
 demand
 side
 platform
 or
 Amazon
 DSP


that
 is
 growing
 really
 quickly
 as
 well.


Some
 of
 it
 have
 to
 had
 to
 do
 with
 the


fact
 that
 we
 had
 some
 features.
 We


always
 had
 a
 number
 of
 the
 core


components
 people
 wanted
 around
 some
 of


our
 properties,


uh
 the
 the
 measurement
 capabilities,
 um


Amazon
 marketing
 cloud,
 but
 we
 lacked


some
 features
 for
 a
 while
 as
 we
 were


building
 out
 our
 DSP
 that
 customers
 told


us
 mattered.
 And
 the
 team
 over
 the
 last


20
 months
 have,
 you
 know,
 closed
 those


gaps
 in
 a
 very
 significant
 way
 so
 that


now
 people
 feel
 like
 our
 DSP
 is
 fully


featured.
 And
 then
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of


the
 partnerships
 that
 we've
 done.
 You


know,
 the
 Roku
 partnership
 gives
 us
 the


largest
 connected
 TV
 footprint
 in
 the


US.
 And
 you
 layer
 on
 top
 of
 that
 what


we've
 recently
 done
 in
 providing
 our
 DSP


customers
 the
 opportunity
 to
 integrate


with
 the
 ad
 inventory
 in
 Netflix
 and
 in


Spotify
 and
 SiriusXM.


You
 know,
 it's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 powerful.


And
 so
 we
 are
 we
 are
 growing
 very


quickly
 on
 the
 demand
 side
 platform.
 So


very
 optimistic
 about
 what
 we're
 doing


there.
 Um
 we
 have,
 you
 know,
 we
 have


continued
 work
 to
 do
 obviously,
 but
 I
 I


don't
 think
 we're
 close
 to
 being
 able
 to


grow
 there.


>> Thanks
 for
 joining
 us
 on
 the
 call
 today


and
 for
 your
 questions.
 A
 replay
 will
 be


available
 on
 our

 for
 at least
 three
 months.
 We


appreciate
 your
 interest
 in
 Amazon
 and


look
 forward
 to
 speaking
 with
 you
 again


next
 quarter.


All
 right,
 folks.


There
 we
 go.
 holding
 the
 gains
 through


the
 call.
 We
 got
 to
 255.


We
 are
 at
 253.
 Sam,
 I'll
 give
 it
 to
 you.


What
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on
 that
 call?


>> Straight
 up
 execution.


OG
 Andy
 Jasse,
 I
 want
 all
 those
 Amazon


bears
 to
 shut
 your
 damn
 mouths.
 All


right.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 hear
 it
 anymore.


All
 right.
 This
 is
 the
 same
 thing
 that


happened
 with
 Google.
 You
 don't
 hear
 a


single
 peep
 on
 Twitter
 anymore.
 I
 don't


want
 to
 hear
 with
 Amazon.
 And
 on
 top
 of


that,
 that
 old
 capex
 argument
 with
 Meta


is
 so
 dumb
 because
 you
 have
 had
 every


single
 other
 mega
 cap
 increase
 their


capex.
 And
 now
 that
 becomes
 an
 argument


for
 Meta,
 man.
 Get
 get
 the
 hell
 out
 of


here.
 That
 it's
 just
 ridiculous.
 The
 the


the
 street
 sold
 off
 Meta
 because
 next


quarter's
 guide
 for
 revenue
 growth
 was


not
 nearly
 as
 much
 as
 the
 previous


quarter.
 But
 anyways,
 dude,
 it's


it's
 a
 great
 day.
 It's
 a
 great
 day.
 So,


let's
 hope
 that
 no
 one
 tweets
 tonight


some
 crazy
 news
 and
 we
 don't
 uh
 go
 limit


down
 overnight.


>> What
 were
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the
 Tranium


stuff,
 which
 I
 felt
 like
 was
 bullish?


>> Uh,
 good
 question.
 I
 actually
 have
 a


Twitter
 thread
 where
 I
 was
 just
 writing


up
 the
 commentary.
 So,
 Tranium
 is


actually
 pretty
 interesting
 because
 they


were
 saying
 that
 uh
 that
 grew
 150%


quarter
 over
 quarter
 for
 Trrenium
 2,


which
 is
 now
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar


business.
 And
 he
 was
 also
 saying
 that


Tranium
 3
 is
 40%
 faster
 than
 Tranium
 2.


Yeah.


>> And
 he's
 also
 saying
 that
 these
 large


clients,
 including
 Anthropic,
 are
 like


ready
 to
 sign
 up
 and
 overs
 subscribe
 for


Tranium
 3.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to
 release


Tranium
 3
 in
 preview
 by
 the
 end
 of the


year
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 ramp
 up
 by


next
 year.
 Dude,
 this
 is
 bullish
 for


AS6.
 And
 and
 he
 was
 also
 saying
 like


this
 is
 also
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia
 too.


Like
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 Nvidia
 is


going to
 go
 downhill
 or
 anything.
 It's


just
 the
 demand
 is
 so
 strong
 that
 people


are
 looking
 for
 a
 specific
 type
 of


compute
 for
 their
 own
 applications,


right?
 So
 if
 you
 stack
 up
 TPUs
 versus


Nvidia
 GPUs,
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 are
 general


processing
 for
 uh
 graphical
 units,


right?
 TPUs
 are
 designed
 specifically


for
 searches
 for
 Google.
 So
 it's
 going


to
 offer
 better
 performance
 and
 much


higher
 margins.
 So
 when
 you
 think
 about


tranium,
 it
 depends
 on
 which
 company
 it


is,
 but
 specifically
 for
 Anthropic,


which
 is
 one
 of
 their
 largest
 customers,


they're
 buying
 tranium
 2
 and
 want
 to
 buy


tranium
 3,
 and
 that's
 a
 much
 higher


margin
 for
 Amazon,
 which
 is
 going
 to


ultimately
 help
 their
 operating
 income.


And
 the
 last
 thing
 too,
 I've
 been
 saying


this
 since
 last
 week,
 Amazon
 laying
 off


14,000
 to
 30,000
 workers
 is
 not
 because


of
 AI.
 It's
 just
 it's
 just
 efficiency.


And
 Andy
 Jasse
 confirmed
 it.
 It's
 more


of
 a
 cultural
 shift.
 He
 wants
 to


downsize
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 kind
 of
 keep


the
 ownership
 in
 there
 because
 dude,


they
 they
 like
 they
 increased
 their


workforce
 and
 so
 did
 the
 entire
 country


in
 2020
 and
 2021.
 It
 all
 needs
 to


normalize,
 right?
 So,
 dude,
 such
 a


bullish
 call,
 man.
 I
 think
 damn,
 that


what
 a
 fake
 out
 today.
 What
 a
 complete


fake
 out.


>> I
 mean,
 fake
 out
 feels
 like
 an


understatement.
 The
 the the
 meta
 PTSD


>> and
 then
 you
 see
 Amazon
 fall
 3%.


Everyone
 was
 feeling
 all
 right,
 what
 are


we
 getting
 ready
 to
 hear?
 And
 then


completely
 opposite
 direction.


>> Some
 someone
 said
 there
 uh
 who
 makes


tranium
 3.
 So
 they
 never
 actually


confirmed
 that
 Marll
 designs
 trrenium
 3.


That
 that
 was
 like
 never
 confirmed


anywhere.
 We
 I
 expected
 to
 hear
 that
 on


um
 Marvel's
 investor
 AI
 investor
 day.


What
 was
 it
 last
 June?
 They
 didn't
 say


anything
 about
 that.
 So
 Marvel
 helps


design
 tranium
 2.
 Do
 they
 design
 tranium


3?
 I
 think
 if
 no
 news
 is
 good
 news.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 assume
 that
 they
 still


are.
 Uh,
 but
 we'll
 see.
 I
 mean,
 Marvel


is
 definitely
 has
 been
 on
 a
 crazy
 run


lately.
 And
 also,
 when
 you
 think
 about


these
 ASIC
 chips,
 dude,
 a
 lot
 of
 high


bandwidth
 memory
 is
 used
 for
 that.
 Look


at
 Micron,
 one
 of the
 largest
 high


bandwidth
 memory
 providers
 in
 the
 entire


world.
 They
 basically
 doubled
 in
 the


last
 few
 months.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 people


were
 able
 to
 ride
 that
 ride,
 including


myself,
 right?
 But
 every
 single
 thing
 in


the
 fabrication
 pipeline
 for
 chips
 is


going
 to
 continue
 riding
 because
 of
 all


because
 of
 all
 this
 demand.
 And
 I
 think


the
 biggest
 thing
 in
 this
 call
 that
 I


heard
 was
 the
 fact
 that
 not
 only
 did


they
 basically
 double
 or
 add
 3.8
 gawatts


of
 capacity
 in
 the
 last
 12
 months,
 but


they
 expect
 to
 add
 another
 1
 gawatt
 of


capacity
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 year,
 so
 this


quarter.
 And
 on
 top
 of
 that,
 they
 expect


to
 double
 total
 capacity
 by
 2027.
 Like


holy
 cow,
 that
 that's
 insane.
 All right,


they
 just
 added
 3.8
 gawatts.
 They're


going
 to
 add
 about
 5
 gawatts
 just
 this


year
 alone
 and
 maybe
 have
 more
 than


double
 that
 by
 2027
 and
 that
 number
 is


going
 to
 be
 way
 more
 than
 10
 gigawatts.


Like,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's


so
 hard
 to
 be
 bearish
 other
 than
 the


fact
 that
 S&P
 is
 totally
 extended
 right


now.
 But,
 you
 know,
 from
 a
 long-term


point
 of
 view,
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 bears
 want.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 they
 want.


I
 would
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 think
 this
 was


one
 of
 those
 quarters
 that
 could
 be
 a


narrative
 rerating
 for
 Amazon.
 Real


quick,
 just
 on
 Apple,
 uh
 they're


assuming
 1.1
 billion
 in
 tariff
 costs
 uh


next
 quarter.
 Company
 significantly


increasing
 investments
 in
 AI.
 Expects


1.4
 billion
 in
 tariff
 related
 impact
 in


December.
 Seeing
 gross
 margin
 between
 47


and
 48.
 Apple
 very
 little
 uh
 decline


from
 284
 to
 279.
 The
 fact
 that
 it
 even


got
 to
 280
 is
 incredible
 to
 see.
 But


Apple
 looks
 like
 those
 tariff
 related


costs
 for
 the
 Q4
 is
 why
 you're
 seeing
 a


little bit
 of
 weakness
 right
 there.
 I


did
 not
 expect
 Apple
 to
 get
 anywhere


near
 your
 280.
 But
 uh
 a
 10
 to
 12%


revenue
 gut
 for
 Q4
 is
 what
 gets
 the


street
 excited
 on
 that
 one.
 In
 terms
 of


Amazon,
 my
 takeaway
 from
 the
 call
 as


well
 was
 that
 Jasse,
 his
 first
 statement


on
 the
 press
 release
 and
 on
 the
 call
 was


that
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 this
 type
 of


demand
 for
 AWS
 since
 2022.
 He
 was
 very


obviously
 talking
 to
 all
 the
 people
 on


Wall
 Street
 and
 the
 broader
 investing


community
 that
 said
 AWS
 is
 hitting
 a


wall
 and
 not
 able
 to
 grow.
 Every
 other


cloud
 provider
 in
 terms
 of
 Microsoft
 and


Google
 is
 above
 20%,
 Google
 at
 30%.
 Uh


Microsoft
 at
 40%
 for
 Azure.
 So,
 you


know,
 Amazon
 stuck
 at
 17.5
 18%
 just


wasn't
 cutting
 it.
 Well,
 he
 got
 to
 20%.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 think
 that
 kind
 of


calmed
 down
 a
 lot
 of
 worries
 from
 the


street.
 Advertising
 continues
 to
 do


well.
 their
 e-commerce
 business
 is
 not


going
 anywhere.
 I
 mean,
 everything
 that


you
 wanted
 to
 see
 from
 Amazon
 pretty


much
 did
 what
 they
 had
 to
 do.
 Austin


right
 here,
 who
 is
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 Amazon


as
 well.
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 his
 Twitter
 in


the
 chat
 for
 anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 follow


him.
 He's
 been
 kind
 of
 covering
 the


Amazon
 thesis
 for
 uh
 really
 the
 past


year
 now.
 He
 says,
 "Amazon
 has
 five


businesses
 greater
 than
 50
 billion
 in


ARR,
 online
 stores,
 thirdparty
 services,


AWS
 advertising,
 and
 subscription."


Now,
 the
 street
 only
 really
 cares
 about


AWS
 because
 the
 narrative,
 but
 now
 that


the
 narrative
 has
 started
 to
 rerate
 to
 a


growth
 quarter,
 I
 think
 that's
 why


you're
 seeing
 this
 type
 of
 move.
 So,
 I


mean,
 I
 would
 be
 surprised.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 are
 asking
 in
 the
 chat,
 and
 Sam,


I'm
 curious
 of
 your
 your
 perspective
 on


this.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm
 putting
 Sam's
 Twitter


in
 the
 chat
 as
 well,
 so
 everyone
 please


make
 sure
 to
 follow
 him
 on
 X.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 are
 saying,
 is
 Amazon
 a
 buy
 right


here?
 I
 think
 I
 would
 give
 it
 a
 couple


weeks
 to
 see
 where
 it
 settles
 in.
 I


wouldn't
 go
 FOMO
 at
 250,
 especially


given
 it
 was
 under
 220
 for
 the
 past
 two


months,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 easily


comes
 back
 to
 220.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking


of
 the
 the
 stock
 price
 right
 now?


>> I
 I
 just
 it's
 such
 a
 it's
 such
 a
 loaded


question.
 And
 not
 saying
 that's
 a
 bad


question,
 but
 like
 you
 can't
 just
 ask


that
 question
 because
 then
 there's
 many


factors
 in
 this,
 right?
 So,
 are
 you


buying
 it
 to
 hold
 it
 for
 a
 long
 time?


Are
 you
 buying
 for
 a
 trade?
 For
 a
 trade,


like
 I
 would
 never
 chase
 something
 like


this,
 right?
 But
 for
 a
 long-term


position,
 like,
 yeah,
 why
 not?
 I
 mean,


if
 you're
 going
 to
 hold
 it
 for
 long
 term


there,
 you
 heard
 every
 single
 thing
 on


the
 call.
 You
 had
 every
 single
 capex


raise
 on
 every
 single
 mega
 cap
 call


there.
 The
 market
 or
 people
 who
 are


bearish
 in
 the
 market
 are
 looking
 for


every
 single
 reason
 for
 the
 market
 to


drop
 or
 end
 its
 AI
 super
 cycle
 from


here.
 It
 just
 does
 not
 look
 like
 it's


ending
 anytime
 soon.
 And
 that
 was
 the


that
 was
 the
 case
 for
 Amazon,
 right?


They're
 going
 to
 slow
 down.
 They
 get


taken
 over
 by
 Microsoft
 next
 two
 or


three
 years.
 I
 I
 never
 necessarily


thought
 that
 was
 the
 case.
 I
 mean,
 maybe


Microsoft
 might
 start
 competing
 with


them
 in
 like
 three
 or
 four
 years
 if
 they


continue
 to
 grow
 around
 40%


year-over-year
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 Azure


growth,
 but
 Amazon
 is
 now
 at
 $121


billion
 run
 rate.
 Now,
 they're
 growing


at
 20%.
 And
 that's
 likely
 going
 to


accelerate
 if
 semi-
 analysis
 research
 is


correct.
 Right?
 So,
 we
 already
 had
 that


20%,
 they
 expected
 to
 be
 around
 22%
 next


year.


>> I
 could
 definitely
 see
 that
 happening.


>> Um,
 the
 thing
 that
 happened
 though
 were


the
 uh
 operating
 margins.
 As
 I


calculated,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 around
 34.7


something%.
 So,
 it
 did
 contract
 by
 about


1%.
 But
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 expected


right
 now
 considering
 how
 much
 overhead


there
 is
 in
 building
 everything
 out
 and


also
 increasing
 the
 amount
 of
 supply
 uh


to
 meet
 the
 demand.
 But
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


it's
 not
 going
 to
 go
 below
 30%.
 If
 it


does,
 I'll
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 concerned.


But
 I
 don't
 think


>> Real
 quick
 before
 you
 continue,
 dude,


operating
 margins
 were
 at
 9.7%


for
 the
 quarter.


>> That's
 for
 the
 whole
 business.


>> I
 know,
 but
 that's
 down
 from
 11.4.
 And


the
 point
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 stock


pumped
 and
 they
 declined
 almost
 2%.


>> Yeah,


>> that
 just
 shows
 you
 how
 important
 AWS


was,
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 it
 might
 be
 a
 seasonality
 thing.


Uh,
 actually,
 no,
 cuz
 if
 it's


year-over-year,
 then
 maybe
 not.
 I


>> believe
 last
 year
 was
 at
 11%.
 It's
 down


2%
 year-over-year
 and
 2.3%
 quarter
 over


quarter.
 The
 fact
 that
 the
 street


overlooked
 that
 and
 is
 giving
 it
 a
 15%


pump
 is
 pretty
 freaking
 bullish.
 It
 goes


to
 your
 point
 about
 AWS
 margins
 being


the
 most
 important.


>> Well,
 it's
 not
 just
 AWS,
 it's
 also
 ads,


right?
 So,
 they
 grew
 ads
 by
 22%
 and


Jasse
 was
 basically
 saying
 it's
 going
 to


keep
 growing
 from
 here.
 Like
 he
 said,


they
 were
 very
 early
 in
 the
 stages.
 So


you
 have
 this
 is
 the
 bare
 case
 for
 TTD


and
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


be
 bearish
 TTD
 but
 like
 when
 you
 have


Amazon
 partnering
 with
 Roku
 who's
 one
 of


the
 largest
 uh
 CTV
 providers
 in
 the


country
 and
 only
 going
 to
 expand
 from


there
 who
 are
 like
 you
 they're
 literally


utilizing
 Amazon's


Amazon's
 demand
 service
 provider


for
 advertising
 and
 that's
 Roku
 and


they're
 going to
 be
 signing
 up
 a
 lot


more
 and
 also
 advertising
 is
 a
 very
 high


margin
 business
 as
 well.
 They
 haven't


released
 operating
 income
 for


advertising
 since
 like
 the
 last
 year,


but
 you
 could
 already
 see
 it's
 growing


at
 22%.
 And
 just
 like
 AWS,
 the
 bigger
 it


gets,
 the
 cheaper
 it
 is
 for
 them
 to


operate
 at
 scale.
 So,
 you
 can
 imagine


like
 with
 automation
 and
 AI
 and


everything
 that
 this
 is
 only
 going
 to


get
 better
 for
 Amazon.
 Um,
 are
 we
 going


to
 see
 220
 again?
 I
 don't
 know.


Yeah,
 I
 was
 the
 LDR
 on
 this
 is
 that
 if


you're
 buying
 for
 the
 long
 term,
 250
 is


sure,
 but
 if
 you
 are
 chasing,


>> you
 would
 not
 chase
 that
 250.
 Not
 after


that.


>> I
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't
 chase
 250.
 I


mean,
 it's
 just
 you're
 just
 hoping
 it


goes
 higher
 with
 the
 market
 all-time


highs.
 You
 know,
 this
 is
 like
 another


one
 of
 those
 things.
 I
 would
 say
 there's


probably
 better
 things
 to
 trade
 on
 the


short
 term
 than
 Amazon
 right
 now.
 Um
 the


alpha
 was
 before
 the
 earnings,
 but
 now


the
 market
 like
 sees
 it.
 It's
 it's
 at


254,
 255
 right
 now.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 it
 it's


just
 very
 difficult
 to
 do
 that.
 But


long-term,
 dude,
 it's
 like
 I
 mean,
 what


are
 you
 going
 to
 wait
 till
 220
 for
 a


5year
 hold
 and
 you're
 just
 going
 to
 miss


out on
 10%.
 Like,
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 deal.


That's
 not
 a
 big
 deal.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 would
 just
 say


psychologically
 like
 we
 are
 on
 the
 right


side
 of
 this
 trade
 because
 we
 bought
 an


early.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 chat
 bought
 in


early.
 Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 community


came
 together
 on
 this.
 We've
 been
 on
 pl


I've
 been
 on
 the
 wrong
 side
 of
 the
 trade


plenty
 of
 times.
 Not
 that
 I'm
 short
 or


that
 I
 have
 puts,
 but
 that
 I'm
 just
 not


in
 it.
 And
 it
 sucks.
 The
 FOMO
 sucks.


stats
 when
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 that
 this
 is


like
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 so
 cliche
 but


the
 way
 I've
 worked
 through
 it
 over
 the


past
 five
 years
 is
 asking
 myself
 what


did
 I
 not
 fully
 understand
 about
 the


bullcase
 and
 how
 can
 I
 get
 better
 as
 an


investor
 over
 the
 lifetime
 of
 this


career
 and
 hopefully
 be
 on
 the
 bullcase


or
 hopefully
 understand
 a
 bullcase
 for
 a


company
 the
 next
 time
 right
 so
 like
 like


like
 it's
 really
 you
 got
 to
 combat
 the


especially
 in
 a
 bull
 market
 because
 you


could
 lose
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 chasing
 stuff


like
 that
 and
 it
 could
 really
 feel
 bad


so
 you
 just
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself
 okay


what
 did
 I
 not
 understand
 about
 Amazon


at
 220
 and
 how
 can
 I
 improve
 next
 time?


Uh,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 that


that
 deals
 with
 the
 the
 mentality
 of


having
 that
 much
 FOMO
 when
 you
 get
 into


it.
 There's
 another
 guy
 who
 was
 super


bullish
 Amazon
 who
 helped
 us
 all


understand
 the
 thesis.


Tanner,
 congrats.
 How
 you
 guys
 doing?


>> What's
 up?
 What's
 up?
 Been
 a
 long
 time,


Mr.
 New
 Bang.


>> Yes.
 Yeah,
 brother.
 Uh,
 man,
 I
 I
 I
 can't


believe
 this.
 This
 is
 uh
 super
 exciting.


People
 are
 understanding
 that


entertainer,
 when
 did
 you
 when
 did
 you


start
 buying
 Amazon?
 Have
 you
 been
 in


here
 for
 a
 minute
 or
 has
 it
 been
 recent?


>> Uh
 last
 two
 quarters
 or
 so.
 Um
 but


really
 buying
 in
 after
 the
 last
 quarter.


Uh
 semi
 analysis.
 Um
 Dylan
 Patel
 ended


up
 posting
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 you
 know
 reports


that
 AWS
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 look
 a
 lot


better
 than
 people
 think
 and
 he
 has
 you


know
 firsthand
 insight
 in
 you
 know


completely
 into
 the
 industry
 and
 you


know
 from
 everything
 that
 I
 was
 seeing


from
 ads
 to
 the
 benefits
 from
 robotics


and
 full
 self-driving
 and
 and
 artificial


intelligence
 and
 stable
 coins
 like
 every


technological
 innovation
 that
 I
 focus
 on


if
 you
 were
 to
 put
 that
 into
 like
 a


multi-bubble


uh
 like
 ven
 diagram.
 Amazon's
 in
 the


direct
 center
 of
 it.
 And
 I
 I
 was
 just


like,
 man,
 I
 need
 to
 start
 building
 up


my
 position
 in
 Amazon.
 And
 now
 we're


seeing,
 you
 know,
 a
 multi-quarter


acceleration
 of
 uh
 AWS.
 I
 mean,
 20%,


they
 have
 not
 seen
 that
 20%
 growth
 since


uh
 December
 of
 2022.
 And
 honestly,


December
 of
 2022,
 it's
 almost
 September


of
 2022.
 It's
 almost
 been
 three
 years


since
 we've
 seen
 this
 level
 of
 growth.


>> And
 th
 those
 comps
 were
 very
 easy
 to


beat
 back
 then.


>> Right.


>> These
 comps
 were
 not
 easy
 to
 beat.


>> Yeah.


>> This
 is
 this
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 Nvidia


reacelerating
 its
 revenue
 on
 the
 data


center
 end
 right
 now,
 which
 they
 kind
 of


are
 forecasting.
 So
 that's
 going
 to
 be


very
 interesting
 to
 see
 next
 quarter.


So,


>> you
 started
 getting
 excited
 about
 Amazon


two
 quarters
 ago.
 I
 got
 excited
 about
 a


month
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 and
 it
 seems
 like


the
 reason
 for
 most
 people
 online


getting
 excited
 about
 the
 name
 is
 cloud


AWS
 and
 the
 lack
 of
 performance
 this


year.
 Is
 there
 anything
 else
 that
 was


really
 getting


>> advertising?


>> Okay,
 so
 cloud
 and
 advertising
 were
 the


two
 core
 things
 that
 you
 focused
 on.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Advertising
 is
 just
 crazy.
 I


I
 I
 don't
 know if
 people
 are
 paying


attention
 to
 all
 the
 names
 that
 I've


been
 buying
 recently,
 but
 like
 if
 you


were
 to
 go
 through
 I
 I
 bought
 um
 Meta
 on


the
 dip
 and
 then
 it
 kept
 dipping.
 I


bought
 TTD.
 I
 bought
 Apploving.
 I
 just


bought
 Reddit
 right
 before
 they
 showed


earnings.
 So
 that
 was
 my
 little


>> Wow,
 congrats.
 Congrats.


>> That
 was
 my
 little
 trade.


>> Um


>> look
 at
 Tanner
 becoming
 a
 trader.
 He


used
 to
 never
 do
 this
 stuff.


>> You
 got
 a
 Discord,
 man?
 You
 got
 a


Patreon?


>> Yeah,
 you
 got
 a
 Patreon,
 bro.


>> No,
 but
 you
 know what?
 Um,
 I
 honestly


I've,
 if
 anyone's
 been
 following
 the


channel,
 I've
 been
 talking
 about
 Reddit


for
 a
 long
 time
 now.


>> Ever
 since
 last
 quarter.
 Well,
 okay,


sorry,
 three
 months,
 but
 but
 almost


every
 day
 for
 three
 months.


Been
 talking
 about
 this
 name.
 Okay,


>> if
 you
 go
 back
 and
 you
 look
 at
 their


earnings
 beat
 every
 single
 quarter,
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 been
 sub
 50%
 EPS
 beat.


like
 Wall
 Street
 has
 just
 been


consistently
 wrong
 on
 this
 name
 since


they've
 been
 a
 public
 company,
 which


hasn't
 been
 super
 long,
 but
 I
 just
 had


an
 inkling.
 So,
 I
 bought
 it
 like
 402
 or


something
 today.
 It
 was
 all
 live,
 so


like
 check
 the
 you
 know,
 check
 the


receipts,
 but
 um


yeah.
 So,
 so
 that
 was
 my
 little
 uh
 my


little
 clip
 of
 the
 day.
 And
 then


>> but
 but
 Reddit's
 advertising
 and


advertising
 in
 general
 is
 what
 also
 got


you
 into
 Amazon
 two
 quarters
 ago.
 every


dude
 advertising
 just
 in
 general
 and
 and


especially
 owning
 the
 customer.
 So
 that


that's
 been
 very
 exciting.
 The
 fact
 that


Amazon
 is
 now
 willing
 with
 their
 DSP
 to


essentially
 just
 go
 face
 to
 face
 against


TTD,
 pay
 for
 those
 campaigns
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 try
 us
 against
 another
 third
 party


company
 and
 you
 see
 who
 you
 like


better."
 That
 that's
 proving
 that


they're
 not
 just
 bundling
 their
 service.


They
 they
 truly
 believe
 that
 like
 their


service
 is
 much
 better.
 the
 the
 the


performance
 of
 their
 advertising
 is
 much


better
 than
 where
 you
 can
 get
 elsewhere.


And
 this
 is
 such
 a
 huge
 target
 across


having
 a
 centralized
 marketplace
 that
 is


Amazon.com,
 Prime
 Video,


like


I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 sometimes
 I
 get
 a


little
 overly
 excited.
 I
 just
 really


like
 Amazon.
 I'm
 loving
 the
 mag
 seven


names
 right
 now.


It's
 crazy
 that
 the
 biggest
 names
 in
 the


stock
 market
 are
 also
 some
 of
 the


fastest
 growing
 high
 highest
 margin


businesses
 across
 the
 board.
 It
 It's


such
 an
 uh
 an
 interesting
 time
 right
 now


where
 you
 don't
 even
 have
 to
 go
 look
 for


the
 next
 speculative
 startup
 names.
 You


can
 just
 buy
 the
 best
 companies
 in
 the


world
 and
 still
 find
 quality
 and
 growth.


>> Okay.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 that.


Sam,
 I
 know
 you
 got
 a
 dip.
 So,
 uh


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Thanks
 for
 being
 on.
 Yes,
 thanks


for
 having
 me
 on


>> Twitter
 right
 there
 in
 the
 chat.
 You
 can


follow
 him.
 Great
 analysis
 and
 uh
 yeah,


thanks
 for
 helping
 us
 understand
 the


Amazon
 story.


>> Talk
 to
 you
 guys
 later.


>> See
 you,
 Sam.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 taken
 a
 look
 at
 Reddit?


>> I
 I
 watched
 your
 deep
 dive
 on
 it.
 Uh
 I


actually
 bought
 it
 back
 at
 115
 and
 then


I
 sold
 it
 like
 at
 120
 or
 something.
 But


um
 first
 of
 all,
 congrats
 on
 the
 trade.


Second
 of
 all,
 I
 agree
 with
 you,
 dude.


These
 mag
 seven
 names
 that
 are
 giving


people
 opportunities.
 First
 of
 all,
 I


think
 a
 year
 from
 now,
 Meta
 down
 12%.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 like,


"That
 was
 stupid."
 And
 now
 Amazon
 for


the
 past
 couple
 months
 that's
 been
 flat


or
 down
 year
 to
 date.
 I
 mean,
 this
 was


at
 212
 weeks
 ago.
 I
 think
 people
 are


going
 to
 say
 that
 was
 stupid.
 So,
 the


question
 then
 becomes
 going
 into
 26,
 are


you
 buying
 these
 dips
 because
 you
 think


the
 MAG
 7
 are
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 being


the
 best
 companies
 in
 the
 world?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 I
 think
 you're
 100%


right.
 I
 was
 talking
 with
 Stephen


Fiorello
 the
 other
 day.


his
 last
 name.
 Like
 we
 don't
 know
 who.


>> Sorry,


>> you're
 talking
 to
 Steve.
 Yes,
 we
 we
 know


who
 he
 is.


>> I
 was
 talking
 to
 Steve
 the
 other
 day
 and


um


>> his
 government
 name.


>> I'm
 friends
 with
 a
 famous
 person.
 I
 like


to,
 you
 know,
 say
 his
 full
 name
 for


people
 know.


>> That's
 true.
 That's
 true.


>> Um
 but


uh
 he
 was
 saying,
 you
 know,
 2026
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 harder
 trading
 year


because
 everything's
 run
 up
 so
 much.
 So,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 hard.
 And
 then
 you


see
 things
 like
 we're
 we're
 fourth


quarter
 2025
 and
 Meta
 sells
 off
 double


digits.
 This
 is
 Meta,
 okay,
 not
 showing


free
 cash
 flow
 deteriorating
 extremely


fast.
 Like
 Capex
 grew,
 but
 so
 did
 free


cash
 flow.
 Like
 they're
 still
 putting
 up


great
 numbers.


I
 think
 we're
 always
 going
 to
 find
 these


opportunities.


Maybe
 broad-based
 if
 you're
 buying
 the


S&P
 500,
 that
 might
 climb,
 but
 you're


going
 to
 see
 these
 weird
 market


reactions.
 constantly.
 So,
 I
 probably
 am


going
 to
 start
 building
 up
 a
 position
 in


Meta
 and
 I
 might
 even
 use
 the
 gains
 that


I've
 had
 from
 Google
 buying
 that
 dip


whenever
 everyone
 forgot
 about
 that
 then


forgot
 about
 Amazon
 and
 now
 people
 are


forgetting
 about
 Meta.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


what
 game
 are
 we
 playing?
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 just
 juggling
 Meg
 seven
 names.
 Like,


I
 don't
 know.


I
 agree
 with
 you.
 It
 it's
 it
 it
 like


buying
 the
 dip
 is
 always
 mentally
 hard,


but
 buying
 the
 dip
 on
 phenomenal


companies
 makes
 it
 easier
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 I


don't
 know
 what
 happens
 to
 Meta.
 I
 think


there's,
 you
 know,
 there's
 the
 streets


going
 to
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 they


think
 of
 it,
 but
 I
 think
 longterm
 it


does
 well.
 And
 then
 Amazon,


this
 this
 is
 one
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 agreed


on
 this.
 I
 like
 there
 was
 push
 back
 on
 X


for
 the
 most
 part
 of
 people
 that
 just


hate
 Jasse.
 And
 I
 mean,
 there
 was
 like


there
 was
 some
 petition
 that
 he
 needs
 to


be
 replaced.
 I
 remember
 arguing
 with


someone
 saying
 he
 needs
 to
 be
 replaced.


I'm
 like
 why
 does
 he
 need
 to
 be
 repl


it's
 almost
 like
 the
 sundar
 needs
 to
 get


fired
 comments.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 outside
 of
 that
 the
 majority
 of


people
 were
 like
 this
 is
 robotics
 AI


cloud
 they
 just
 needed
 AWS
 and
 they


delivered.
 I'll
 ask
 you
 the
 same


question
 that
 I
 asked
 Sam.
 Would
 you
 buy


after
 this
 15%
 move
 or
 no?


>> It's
 harder
 now.
 Um
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at


the
 the
 multiples
 and
 where
 this
 will
 be


whenever
 it
 opens
 tomorrow
 at
 250.


Um,
 but
 no,
 I'm
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to


start
 buying
 positions
 in
 meta
 to
 be


honest.


>> Um,


like


I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 not
 only
 is
 advertising


going
 to
 continuously
 grow
 as
 an


industry
 for
 forever.
 Um,
 but
 that


things
 like
 aentic
 commerce
 and
 the
 the


ability
 to
 target
 people
 better
 with
 uh


advertising
 is
 only
 going
 to
 make
 their


take
 rates
 better.
 And
 then
 all
 of
 these


companies
 for
 the
 most
 part
 even
 though


they're
 in,
 you
 know,
 100
 plus


countries,
 the
 majority
 of
 their


business
 is
 done
 in
 one
 or
 two


countries,
 US
 and
 Canada.
 And
 so
 as


Meta,


Amazon,
 all
 of
 these
 business
 expand


internationally,
 and
 they
 usually
 see


faster
 growth
 internationally
 than
 they


do
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 there's
 so
 much


business
 left
 to
 grow.
 Like
 these
 could


be
 10
 trillion
 plus
 dollar
 businesses
 in


the
 future.
 But
 just
 because
 we
 haven't


seen
 a
 company
 at
 that
 size
 before,


people
 think
 that
 it's
 not
 plausible.


But
 I
 don't
 know.
 We
 saw
 Nvidia
 break


four
 trillion,
 5
 trillion.
 No
 one


thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 do
 that.


You
 think
 they're
 going to
 get
 six


trillion
 this
 year
 in
 video?


>> Okay.
 Now,
 see,
 now
 you're
 sounding
 like


Steven
 Fiorillo.
 He's
 He's
 talking
 about


1980.
 No,
 I
 don't.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


that
 would
 be
 healthy,
 quite
 frankly.


Not
 in
 90
 days
 for
 them
 to
 hit
 six


trillion.
 It
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 cool.


>> 60
 days?
 I
 don't
 know,
 bro.
 A
 trillion


in
 60
 days.
 They
 were
 at
 four
 trillion.


What?
 July
 they
 hit
 it
 for
 the
 first


time.


>> Yeah,
 something
 like
 that.
 Yeah,


>> it's
 quite
 incredible.
 But
 even
 Jasse
 on


the
 call
 when
 you
 talking
 about
 the


tranium
 chips,
 I
 mean
 you're
 you're


seeing
 the
 progress
 of
 the,
 you
 know,


everyone's
 asking
 ROI.
 You're
 seeing
 it


with
 how
 they're
 monetizing
 tranium
 in


collaboration
 with
 Nvidia.


>> Someone
 said
 Stephen
 who?
 Please


specify.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 All
 right.
 Well,


congrats
 to
 everybody.
 Hell
 of
 an


earnings
 day.
 There's
 Tanner
 right


there.
 Tanner's
 YouTube
 putting
 it
 in


the
 chat.
 Uh,
 thanks.
 I'll
 be


>> I'll
 be
 live
 with
 Steve
 at
 9:30
 again


tonight.
 Tanner,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 join,


feel
 free.
 I
 think
 Chris
 will
 be
 joining


that
 one.
 And,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 we'll


probably
 be
 talking
 Amazon.
 But
 this
 was


a
 good
 one,
 dude.
 And
 and
 it
 felt
 like


the
 sky
 was
 falling
 at
 359.
 For
 whatever


reason,
 the
 algos
 wanted
 to
 dump
 and
 be


stupid
 and
 bitcoins
 recovering
 a
 little


bit,
 but
 you
 needed
 this
 one
 to
 go
 well


and
 this
 one
 went
 well.
 Man,
 the
 amount


honestly
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 amount
 of


quotes
 that
 I
 was
 finding
 from
 Amazon's


quarter


and
 uh
 it's
 in
 it's
 incredible
 some
 of


the
 things
 that
 he
 ended
 up
 send
 like


did
 you
 even
 see
 the
 the
 tranium
 growth


fully
 subscribed
 they
 grew
 150%
 quarter


over
 quarter


>> it's
 40
 it's
 40%
 better
 than
 trrenium
 2


you
 know


>> and
 drop
 already
 signed
 up
 for
 the
 next


set
 of
 chips
 yeah
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 a
 big


And
 and
 even
 Rufus,
 I
 thought
 everyone


was
 having
 terrible
 uh
 experiences
 with


Rufus.
 I've
 only
 heard
 bad
 things.
 They


said
 users
 that
 were
 using
 Rufus
 uh


interactions
 went
 up
 210%


and
 they
 were
 60%
 more
 likely
 to


complete
 a
 purchase.


>> Yeah.
 To
 drive
 over
 10
 billion
 in


incremental
 annualized
 sales.


>> Yeah.
 I've
 never
 used
 Rufus,
 but
 I
 would


imagine
 other
 people
 do.
 And
 I
 mean


people
 in
 the
 chat
 were
 saying
 that
 the


Amazon
 ads
 get
 them
 every
 day
 and
 they


buy
 something
 new
 from
 it.
 So


>> yeah,
 why
 not?


>> Yeah,
 same
 thing
 with
 Gemini,
 right?


People
 overlook
 it
 for
 so
 long
 and
 then


you
 realize
 that
 it
 continues
 to
 pick
 up


speed
 and
 it's
 actually
 doing
 very
 well.


And
 AI
 overviews
 and
 AI
 modes
 monetizing


at
 the
 same
 level
 of
 Google
 search.
 And


I
 if
 someone
 were
 to
 think
 out
 that


problem,
 they
 probably
 wouldn't
 believe


it.
 But
 the
 facts
 are
 the
 facts
 unless


you
 think
 that
 Sundar
 or
 Andy
 Jasse
 or


some
 of
 these
 guys
 are
 lying
 on
 these


calls
 which
 clearly
 they're
 not
 you
 know


but


>> yeah
 and
 then
 you
 know
 when
 he
 was
 asked


about
 robotics
 Amazon
 obviously
 I
 I


think
 they
 are
 the
 number
 one
 company
 on


the
 planet
 that
 is
 infiltrated
 with


robotics
 and
 has
 been
 for
 the
 past


decade.
 So
 that's
 a
 massive
 tailwind
 to


increase
 their
 margins.
 What
 what
 was


your
 take
 on
 the
 layoff
 question
 that
 he


said
 it
 was
 about
 culture
 not
 AI?
 Do
 you


do
 you
 believe
 him
 when
 he
 says
 that?


>> Uh
 you
 know what
 I
 said
 that
 he
 wasn't


lying
 about
 things.
 I
 don't
 know.
 He


might
 be
 lying
 about
 that
 one.
 We
 We'll


see.
 But
 um
 to
 me
 it
 feels
 like
 AI,


not
 financial
 and
 not
 even
 AIdriven.


Okay.


Well,
 he
 did
 say
 they
 hired
 like
 crazy


during
 COVID
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 natural


downsizing,
 but
 I
 agree.
 some
 of
 the


jobs
 that
 have
 been
 replaced.
 You
 could


argue
 AI
 probably
 can


>> Yeah,
 but
 how
 is
 that
 not
 financially


driven,
 culturally
 driven?


>> It's
 a
 fair
 point.


>> They're
 just
 not
 blending
 into
 the
 AI


workforce.
 Like
 to
 me,
 the
 way
 I
 think


of
 the
 AI
 or
 or
 sorry,
 the
 Amazon


workforce
 is
 like,


you
 know,
 employee
 47104,
 please
 get
 to


your
 station.
 Like,
 there's
 no
 culture.


You
 got
 Amazon
 drivers
 pissing
 in


bottles
 so
 they
 can
 make
 their
 time


slots.
 It's
 like
 what
 what's
 the
 culture


of
 Amazon?


>> That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 That's
 a
 fair


point.
 And
 the
 corporate
 workforce,
 I


mean,
 there
 were
 some
 people
 who
 work
 at


Amazon
 in
 the
 chat
 and
 they
 said,
 "Dude,


it's
 not
 about
 the
 culture.
 Let
 me
 tell


you
 that."


>> So,


>> yeah.


>> Yeah.
 One
 could
 argue
 this
 was
 more


financially
 motivated,
 but
 but
 again,


this
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 conversation
 we've


been
 having
 for
 about
 a
 year
 now.
 You've


got
 to
 own
 the
 asset.
 You
 have
 to
 own


the
 asset.
 Whether
 it's
 one
 share,
 a
 100


shares,
 a
 thousand
 shares
 over
 your


lifetime,
 whatever
 you
 can
 DCA
 into


these
 companies
 that
 are
 defining
 what


will
 be
 the
 technology
 of
 our
 lifetimes,


which
 is
 AI,
 you've
 got
 to
 own
 them


because
 when
 people
 get
 fired
 from


Amazon
 and
 then
 they
 increase
 AWS


revenues
 and
 then
 their
 operational


efficiencies
 get
 better,
 who
 gets


rewarded?
 The
 shareholder.
 It's
 just


that
 simple.
 You
 can
 hate
 it,
 you
 can


love
 it,
 but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 make
 money


and
 you
 want
 to
 secure
 a
 financial


future
 and
 not
 be
 stuck
 to
 the
 whims
 of


currency
 debasement
 or
 inflation,
 you've


got
 to
 own
 something
 that
 is
 going
 to


benefit
 from
 this
 tailwind.
 And
 that's


likely
 these
 tech
 companies
 that
 are
 the


biggest
 tech
 companies
 we've
 ever
 seen.


>> Amit
 the
 immoral
 investor,
 eh,


>> I
 don't
 even
 think,
 you
 know,
 get


morality
 out
 of
 it.
 It's
 just
 like
 how


do
 you
 secure
 your
 financial
 future?


You've
 got
 to
 be
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the


asset
 holder
 versus
 the
 person


complaining
 about
 the
 company.


>> Have
 you
 seen
 the
 movie
 War
 Dogs?


>> Classic,
 dude.
 I
 love
 that
 movie.


>> Dude,
 shut
 up,


>> dude.
 I've
 seen
 it.
 What
 are
 you
 talking


about?
 Jonah
 Hill
 2016.
 Classic,
 bro.


It's
 on
 Amazon
 Prime.


>> 2016
 movie
 with,
 you
 know,
 Jonah
 Hill.


>> It's
 an
 hour
 and
 54
 minutes,
 bro.


It
 reminds
 me
 of
 that
 where
 there's
 uh


two
 kids
 that
 will
 do
 anything
 to
 sell


guns
 to
 any
 side,
 any
 team,
 doesn't


matter.
 It's
 not
 about
 the
 morals,
 it's


about
 the
 profits.


>> Agreed.
 I
 I
 think
 the
 scene
 in
 the
 movie


that
 was
 really
 important
 is
 when
 they


started
 selling
 the
 guns
 because
 that
 to


me
 defined
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 ambition


that
 they
 had
 to,
 you
 know,
 to
 to


thrive.
 So,
 I
 agree.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 what
 it's
 been
 a
 while
 since


I've
 seen
 it,
 but
 you
 know
 what
 happened


during
 the
 movie?
 Yeah.


Uh
 anyway,


>> yeah,
 let's
 talk
 BMR.
 Oh,
 wait,
 no,
 I


have
 to
 go.
 Um,


>> well,
 hold
 on
 real
 quick.
 Let's
 just
 say


this
 on
 BMR
 because
 everyone
 is
 going


crazy
 about
 this.
 I
 mean,
 I
 said
 my


thoughts
 in
 the
 morning,
 but
 you
 can


give
 your
 thoughts.
 I
 think
 people
 are


really
 freaking
 out
 about
 it
 because


it's
 going
 down,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,


they're
 not
 remembering
 why
 they
 got
 in


it.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 and
 I
 got
 in
 it


because
 we
 believe
 in
 Ethereum
 and
 we've


been
 studying
 the
 technology
 for
 a


minute
 and
 you
 know
 given
 the


intersection
 with
 Robin
 tokenization


we're
 big
 Robinet
 fans
 that's
 why
 we
 got


excited
 about
 it.
 Uh
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 got
 in
 it
 because
 they
 just


wanted
 the
 stock
 to
 go
 up.
 So
 what
 is


your
 take
 on
 what's
 been
 going
 on
 with


BMR?


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 worried
 about


the
 uh
 the
 the
 share
 price
 right
 now.


They're
 not
 at
 their
 5%
 alchemy
 of


holding
 ETH.
 So
 the
 playbook
 is
 simple.


They're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 acquire


more
 ETH.
 What
 happens
 in
 the
 share


price
 from
 then
 till
 now,
 I've
 got
 no


control
 over
 that.
 I
 mean,
 you
 were
 a


long
 holder
 of
 Palunteer
 through
 $8
 and


everything
 where
 the
 business
 looked


like
 it
 was
 going
 in
 one
 direction,
 the


stock
 was
 going
 in
 a
 complete
 other
 one.


I
 mean,
 that
 the
 the
 stock
 market
 does


not
 have
 to
 adjust
 on
 your
 timeline.


>> We
 just
 experienced
 this
 with
 Amazon.


>> Yeah,


>> we
 just
 experienced
 it.
 stuck
 at
 the


whole
 freaking
 country
 shut
 down
 because


of
 AWS.
 Stocks
 at
 212
 like
 and
 now
 it's


at
 250.
 So
 I
 think
 narrative
 moves
 with


price
 as
 easily
 as
 it
 as
 emotions
 go
 to


the
 euphoric
 stage
 with
 price.
 But
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you
 have
 to


understand
 why
 you
 bought
 BMR
 in
 the


first
 place.
 And
 I
 think it's
 because


you
 and
 me
 are
 looking
 at
 what
 Vlad
 is


doing
 with
 Robin
 Hood.
 We're
 looking
 at


what what
 Larry
 Frink
 is
 doing
 with


Black
 Rockck.
 And
 we're
 looking
 at
 the


intersection
 of
 Wall
 Street
 and


blockchain.
 And
 it's
 becoming
 very
 clear


that
 Ethereum
 likely
 is
 the
 winner.


Maybe
 it's
 not,
 but
 that's
 at least
 the


thesis
 we
 have,
 just
 like
 everyone
 had
 a


thesis
 that
 AWS
 would
 be
 able
 to
 grow.


And
 then
 you're
 just
 getting
 leverage


against
 it
 with
 BMR.
 If
 you
 hate
 that


thesis,
 then
 don't
 get
 into
 the
 story.


But
 if
 you
 think
 that
 thesis
 makes


sense,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal


with
 the
 volatility
 of
 that
 thesis.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 want
 some
 real
 gains,
 stock


just
 can't
 go
 up
 every
 single
 day


because
 that's
 not
 how
 crypto
 works.
 And


if
 you
 didn't
 know
 that,
 then
 then
 get


out
 of
 it,
 right?
 then
 then
 cryptos
 then


a
 cryptole
 leveraged
 digital
 asset


treasury
 is
 not
 for
 you
 and
 that's
 okay


but
 I
 think
 people
 freaking
 out
 about
 it


because
 the
 price
 is
 down
 it's
 just
 like


any
 stock


>> will
 have
 a
 price


>> yeah
 um
 if
 you've
 seen
 this
 already
 it
 I


don't
 need
 to
 show
 it
 again
 but
 these


are
 maybe
 the
 two
 most
 powerful
 names
 in


financial
 services
 right
 now
 Larry
 Frink


and
 Jamie
 Diamond
 17c
 clip
 just
 about


how
 Jaime
 Diamond
 has
 completely
 flipped


his
 opinion
 of
 blockchain
 and
 crypto


services


>> skeptical
 of
 crypto
 at
 one
 point
 he
 was


still
 skept
 with
 no
 damage
 so
 far.


Crypto
 is
 real.
 If
 you
 mean
 blockchain,


stable
 coins,
 you
 have
 a
 JP
 Morgan


deposit
 coin.
 You
 can
 move
 stuff.
 Smart


contracts
 are
 real.
 All
 that
 stuff
 is


real.
 It
 will
 be
 used
 by
 all
 of
 us
 to


facilitate,
 you
 know,
 better


transactions
 and
 customer.


>> Anybody
 skeptical
 of
 crypto
 at
 one?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 haven't
 seen
 that.
 Wow.


That
 that
 happened
 today
 uh
 about
 six


hours
 ago.


I
 saw
 I
 saw
 Think
 give
 a
 speech,
 but
 I


did
 not
 see
 Jamie
 Diamond
 admit
 that


it's
 all
 real.


So,
 the
 the
 the
 business
 model
 of
 BMR,


in
 my
 opinion,
 it
 it
 would
 be
 hard
 for


it
 to
 even
 be
 a
 scam,
 as
 some
 people
 are


alluding
 to.
 All
 they
 do
 is
 acquire


Ethereum.
 There's
 no
 secret
 sauce
 about


it.
 They've
 barely
 created
 many


different
 ways
 to
 acquire
 Ethereum.


They're
 selling
 their
 stock.
 They're


buying
 Ethereum.
 If
 Ethereum
 is
 not


running,
 that's
 not
 like
 Ethereum
 didn't


just
 get
 created
 today.
 This
 has
 been


around
 for,
 you
 know,
 almost
 a
 decade
 um


or
 a
 little
 over
 a
 decade.
 And
 um
 now


you
 just
 have
 a
 purchaser
 of
 Ethereum.


Now,
 all
 of
 the
 largest
 financial


managers
 and
 and
 biggest
 guy
 like
 don't


trust
 me,
 don't
 trust
 uh
 Emit.
 Trust
 the


guys
 that
 are
 moving
 hundreds
 of


billions,
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 a
 day,
 a


week,
 a
 year,
 like
 they're
 all
 on
 the


blockchain
 thesis
 now.
 They
 they
 they


see
 no
 way
 around
 it.


>> So,


>> yeah.
 And
 look,
 that
 doesn't
 mean


Ethereum
 has
 to
 win.
 That
 also
 doesn't


mean
 Bitmine
 has
 to
 keep
 their
 MNAV.
 But


I
 I
 you
 either
 understand
 that
 thesis


and
 believe
 in
 it
 and
 you
 want
 to
 be


long
 it
 or
 you
 don't.
 And
 if
 you
 don't


then
 there's
 plenty
 of
 other


opportunities
 in
 this
 market
 like
 Meta


that
 just
 took
 a
 nasty
 dip
 that
 you
 know


it's
 a
 more
 fundamental
 business
 you


understand
 it
 you
 understand
 cash
 flows


all
 that
 stuff
 then
 shift
 the
 money


there.
 But
 I
 I
 do
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 just
 reacting
 to
 the
 price
 and
 it's


like
 if
 the
 price
 is
 going
 to
 control


the
 emotion
 uh
 then
 you
 can't
 be
 in


anything
 that's
 crypto
 derivative.
 Now,


one
 of the
 reasons
 I
 love
 Robin
 Hood
 is


because
 it's
 rooted
 in
 crypto
 in
 terms


of
 it
 being
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 revenues,


but
 it's
 like
 a
 real
 fundamental


business
 that
 has
 other
 elements
 to
 it.


But
 make
 no
 mistake
 about
 it,
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 Robin
 is
 at
 $130
 billion
 market


cap
 is
 because
 crypto
 has
 had
 a
 pretty


good
 past
 couple
 years.
 So,
 it's
 like
 if


you're
 going
 to
 be
 leveraging
 anything


that
 is
 going
 to
 have
 uh
 meaningful


exposure
 to
 the
 upside
 when
 it
 comes
 to


the
 cryptocurrency
 markets,
 you've
 got


to
 be
 ready
 for
 that
 volatility.
 Not
 to


mention
 the
 administration,
 Donnie
 T
 and


all
 of
 his
 friends,
 including
 his
 sons,


they
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 ETH
 and
 they
 are


making
 sure
 legislation
 and
 regulatory


frameworks
 are
 on
 the
 side
 of
 Ethereum.


So
 again,
 I
 just
 think
 being
 blinded
 by


short-term
 price
 action
 on
 any
 asset,


much
 less
 BMR
 is
 going
 to
 hurt
 in
 the


long
 term,
 but
 or
 hurt
 in
 the
 short


term.
 In
 the
 long
 term,
 you
 know,
 if


there's
 an
 underlying
 thesis,
 the
 stock


should
 perform.
 Another
 guy,
 by
 the
 way,


Vlad
 Tennov,
 the
 guy
 who's,
 you
 know,


brought
 Hood
 to
 where
 it
 is,
 is
 also


saying
 that
 the
 entire
 financial
 system


will
 be
 tokenized.
 And
 they
 specifically


are
 building
 their
 L2
 directly
 on


Ethereum.
 The
 Robin
 Hood
 chain
 is
 on


Ethereum.
 They
 could
 have
 picked
 Salana.


They
 could
 have
 picked
 Aval.
 They
 could


have
 picked
 whatever
 they,
 you
 know,
 and


I
 kind
 of
 trust
 Vlad
 as
 someone
 who


understands
 where
 the
 future
 of
 finance


is
 going.
 So,


>> all
 right.
 We
 got


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you,
 Tanner.
 entertainers


YouTube
 right
 there
 in
 the
 chat.
 Amazon,


congrats
 to
 everybody.
 We'll
 talk
 more


about
 it
 tomorrow
 in
 the
 market
 open.


This
 was
 a
 big
 win
 for
 everyone
 in


retail.
 I
 think
 we
 all
 came
 together
 on


this
 one
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 we'll
 keep
 it


going.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Appreciate


it.
 See
 you
 guys
 tomorrow.
