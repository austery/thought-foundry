Hi,
 this
 is
 Daria.
 Today
 we're
 talking


about
 the
 future
 of
 tech
 jobs
 and


focusing
 specifically
 on
 the
 next
 10
 to


15
 years.
 There
 are
 some
 very
 clear


trends
 we
 can
 bank
 on
 even
 now.
 I
 will


be
 talking
 about
 the
 roles
 that
 already


show
 very
 strong
 momentum
 and
 are


guaranteed
 to
 keep
 growing.
 Now,
 I


didn't
 want
 to
 make
 yet
 another
 video


talking
 about
 AI.
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 very


actionable
 and
 also
 suitable
 for
 people


with
 various
 backgrounds,
 whether
 it's


tech,
 non-
 tech,
 business,
 science,
 etc.


So,
 here's
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 cover.
 I'll


walk
 you
 through
 specific
 fields,
 not


just
 roles,
 that
 will
 dominate
 the
 tech


market
 in
 the
 next
 15
 years.
 For
 each,
 I


will
 give
 proven
 stats
 and
 numbers
 that


will
 explain
 why
 those
 are
 the
 jobs
 of


the
 next
 10
 years.
 I
 will
 also
 discuss


less
 techy
 and
 more
 techy
 options
 to


show
 you
 the
 variety
 of
 roles
 that
 exist


out
 there.
 And
 then
 we'll
 briefly
 talk


about
 the
 salaries
 in
 different
 parts
 of


the
 world.
 Starting
 with
 cyber
 security.


Now,
 what
 is
 cyber
 security?
 Cyber


security
 is
 the
 practice
 of
 defending


computers,
 servers,
 mobile
 devices,


networks,
 and
 data
 from
 malicious


attacks.
 It
 includes
 firewalls
 that


block
 threats,
 systems
 that
 detect


intrusions
 in
 real
 time,
 encryption
 that


keeps
 sensitive
 data
 safe,
 and
 response


teams
 that
 act
 fast
 when
 a
 breach


happens.
 If
 it
 touches
 the
 internet,


it's
 a
 target
 and
 someone
 needs
 to
 be


there
 to
 secure
 it.
 Now,
 why
 is
 it
 the


job
 of
 the
 future?
 Cyber
 threats


increase
 in
 volume
 and
 complexity.
 Every


year,
 attackers
 use
 more
 sophisticated


tools
 to
 target
 everything
 from
 small


businesses
 to
 infrastructure.
 And
 on
 top


of
 that,
 AI
 is
 now
 being
 used
 by
 both


attackers
 and
 defenders.
 Hackers
 use
 AI


to
 automate
 fishing,
 crack
 passwords,


and
 find
 vulnerabilities
 faster
 than


ever.
 Security
 teams
 are
 using
 AI
 for


real-time
 threat
 detection
 and
 incident


response.
 Add
 the
 explosion
 of
 the


remote
 work,
 cloud
 adoption,
 and
 IoT,


and
 the
 need
 for
 security
 expert
 is
 only


accelerating.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the


numbers.
 There's
 a
 massive
 market


demand.
 AI
 and
 cyber
 security
 is


projected
 to
 hit
 $12
 billion
 by
 2032.


And
 this
 is
 the
 growth
 from
 24.8
 in


2024.
 Number
 two,
 also
 there
 is
 a
 severe


talent
 gap.
 Cyber
 security
 roles
 remain


to
 be
 unfilled
 globally.
 Exploding


demand.
 Cyber
 security
 job
 growth
 is


267%.


This
 is
 three
 times
 faster
 than
 any


other
 job
 in
 tech.
 AI
 adoption
 is


becoming
 mainstream.
 44%
 of
 companies


already
 use
 AI
 to
 detect
 cyber
 threats.


Now,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 roles.
 We're


starting
 with
 more
 techy
 cyber
 security


engineer.
 They
 design
 secure
 systems
 and


infrastructure.
 They
 manage
 firewalls


and
 monitor
 network
 activity.
 Number


two,
 testers
 and
 ethical
 hackers.
 They


simulate
 cyber
 attacks
 to
 find


vulnerabilities
 before
 real
 hackers
 do.


Incident
 responders.
 They
 investigate


security
 breaches.
 They
 contain
 threats


and
 restore
 system
 during
 a
 cyber
 event.


And
 security
 architects,
 they
 develop


the
 overall
 security
 framework
 and


strategy
 for
 the
 entire
 company.
 Now
 on


to
 the
 less
 techy
 jobs.
 Sales
 engineer,


they
 work
 with
 a
 sales
 team
 to
 explain


security
 product
 to
 the
 client.
 This
 is


a
 perfect
 mix
 of
 sales
 and
 cyber


security
 job.
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 need


to
 code
 every
 single
 day,
 but
 you
 need


to
 understand
 the
 industry
 and
 the


trends
 deeply
 to
 be
 able
 to
 provide
 the


right
 solution
 to
 the
 customer.


Compliance
 analysts,
 they
 ensure
 the


company
 meets
 laws
 and
 regulations
 like


GDPR
 or
 so
 to
 compliance.
 It's
 very


heavy
 at
 documentation,
 audits
 and


policy.
 Security
 awareness
 trainer
 or


could
 also
 be
 a
 program
 manager
 on
 cyber


security
 for
 a
 given
 organization.
 They


build
 internal
 training
 programs
 to


teach
 employees
 how
 to
 avoid
 fishing


scams
 and
 breaches
 and
 all
 sorts
 of


things.
 It's
 a
 great
 job
 if
 you're
 good


at
 communication
 and
 training
 personnel.


As
 for
 the


salaries,
 moving
 on
 to
 cloud.
 What
 is


cloud?
 Cloud
 computing
 means
 you
 don't


store
 your
 information
 or
 data
 or
 run


your
 own
 software
 on
 local
 machines


anymore.
 It
 all
 lives
 in
 remote
 servers


maintained
 by
 companies
 like
 AWS,
 Google


Cloud
 or
 Azure.
 The
 cloud
 powers


everything
 from
 Tik
 Tok
 to
 Zoom
 to


fintech
 apps.
 It's
 not
 just
 storage.


It's
 the
 infrastructure
 backbone
 of


modern
 tech.
 Why
 is
 it
 a
 job
 of
 the


future?
 Because
 companies
 are
 migrating


to
 cloud
 to
 save
 money
 and
 scale
 faster.


What
 used
 to
 take
 6
 months
 before
 in
 a


data
 center
 now
 takes
 6
 minutes
 in
 AWS.


But
 the
 complexity
 has
 also
 grown.


Businesses
 are
 wasting
 millions
 on


misconfigured
 or
 or
 reused
 services.


Cloud
 now
 also
 powers
 AI
 training
 and


deployment.
 So
 cloud
 talent
 is


missionritical
 for
 security,


scalability,
 and
 cost
 management.
 Now


onto
 the
 numbers.
 Cloud
 market
 is


booming.
 Just
 listen
 to
 this.
 It's


projected
 to
 grow
 from


$722
 billion
 in
 2025
 to
 2.7
 trillion
 by


2034.
 There
 is
 a
 massive
 total


addressable
 market.
 Cloud
 services


expect
 to
 hit
 two
 trillion
 by
 2032,


growing
 at
 22%.
 AI
 fueled
 growth.


Generative
 AI
 could
 drive
 200
 billion
 to


300
 billion
 in
 cloud
 spend
 by
 2030.


Cloud
 has
 also
 a
 very
 diverse
 revenue


stream.
 You
 can
 go
 into
 software
 as
 a


service,
 platform
 as
 a
 service,


infrastructure
 as
 a
 service,
 backend
 as


a
 service.
 There
 is
 a
 large
 variety
 of


cloud
 deployment
 models.
 Now
 talking


about
 the
 jobs
 starting
 with
 the
 more


techy
 ones.
 Cloud
 engineer
 they
 build


and
 maintain
 the
 entire
 cloud


infrastructure.
 DevOps
 engineer
 they


automate
 deployment
 and
 integration


pipelines.
 They
 manage
 CI/CD
 and
 do
 all


sorts
 of
 optimization
 of
 cloud


environment.
 Site
 reliability
 engineer.


They
 ensure
 the
 cloud
 systems
 are


reliable,
 available
 and
 scalable
 with


minimum
 downtime.
 And
 lastly
 cloud


security
 engineer.
 They
 design
 and


enforce
 security
 for
 cloud-based
 systems


and
 services.
 Onto
 the
 less
 techy
 job,


cloud
 product
 manager.
 They
 define


features
 for
 cloud
 services
 and
 make


them
 usable
 for
 developers.
 It
 is
 still


a
 pretty
 technical
 job
 for
 a
 product


manager,
 but
 at least
 you
 don't
 have
 to


code
 every
 single
 day.
 Cloud
 account


executive
 or
 cloud
 sales
 engineer.
 They


sell
 cloud
 infrastructure
 solutions
 to


businesses
 and
 make
 very
 good


commissions.
 Cloud
 billing
 analyst.
 They


track
 and
 reduce
 cloud
 spending
 across


departments.
 And
 this
 specific
 role
 is


growing
 very
 fast
 due
 to
 rising
 cloud


bills.
 as
 for
 the


salaries.
 Moving
 on
 to
 AI
 ethics.
 What


is
 AI
 ethics?
 AI
 ethics
 is
 the
 field


making
 sure
 artificial
 intelligence


systems
 act
 fairly,
 responsibly,
 and


transparently.
 That
 means
 preventing


algorithmic
 bias,
 ensuring
 people
 know


how
 decisions
 are
 made,
 and
 protecting


user
 rights.
 For
 example,
 if
 a
 system


decides
 who
 gets
 a
 loan
 or
 who
 gets
 a


job,
 someone
 has
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


being
 fair
 in
 those
 decisions.
 Why
 is
 it


the
 job
 of
 the
 future?
 AI
 is
 rolling
 out


faster
 than
 most
 people
 can
 understand


it.
 It's
 used
 in
 hiring,
 credit
 score,


law
 enforcement,
 healthcare,


governments,
 all
 sorts
 of
 things.
 We


have
 to
 put
 in
 regulations
 in
 place
 and


governments
 are
 stepping
 in
 with
 new


regulations.
 Public
 trust
 and
 AI
 is
 very


fragile
 and
 companies
 cannot
 afford


ethical
 failures.
 As
 regulations


increase,
 companies
 are
 forming


dedicated,
 responsible
 AI
 teams
 and


they're
 hiring
 people
 who
 understand


both
 ethics
 and
 policy.
 Speaking
 of
 the


numbers,
 it
 is
 a
 very
 fast
 growing


field.
 AI
 ethics
 is
 expected
 to
 grow
 by


28%
 by
 2029.
 New
 roles
 are
 being
 formed.


Titles
 such
 as
 AI
 ethics
 officer
 and


human
 AI
 collaboration
 specialist
 and


all
 sorts
 of
 AI
 ethics
 roles
 will
 be


emerging
 as
 of
 2025.
 hiring
 surge.
 AI


job
 postings
 jumped
 38%
 between
 2020
 and


2024
 with
 rising
 demand
 for
 ethics


oversight.
 And
 lastly,
 AI
 will
 add
 $15


trillion
 to
 the
 global
 economy
 by
 2030.


Ethical
 safeguards
 are
 now
 business


critical.
 Lastly,
 there
 is
 a
 massive


talent
 and
 skill
 gap.
 AI
 is
 creating
 78


million
 jobs
 by
 2030,
 but
 ethics
 talent


is
 still
 in
 short
 supply.
 Now,
 on
 to
 the


jobs.
 More
 techy
 ones.
 AI
 auditor.
 They


evaluate
 models
 for
 bias,
 fairness,
 and


compliance.
 A
 machine
 learning


researcher
 with
 ethics
 focus.
 They

models
 with
 interpretability
 and
 safety


as
 primary
 goals.
 AI
 governance


engineer.
 They
 develop
 tools
 to
 monitor,


document,
 and
 control
 AI
 systems
 at


scale.
 Responsible
 AI
 engineers.
 They


build
 pipelines
 that
 prioritize


fairness,
 explanability,
 and


traceability
 and
 AI
 outputs.
 Onto
 the


less
 techy
 jobs.
 AI
 policy
 analyst


tracks
 AI
 related
 legislation,
 advises


teams
 on
 compliance
 and
 works
 with


public
 agencies.
 Ethics

They
 build
 internal
 programs
 to
 ensure


AI
 systems
 follow
 ethical
 standards.
 AI


PR
 and
 communications
 leads.
 They
 shape


public
 messaging
 around
 AI
 and
 prepare


for
 political
 and
 ethical
 scrutiny.
 This


is
 the
 kind
 of
 a
 role
 where
 crisis


management
 meets
 tech.
 This
 is
 a


wonderful
 job
 for
 people
 who
 studied


philosophy,


psychology,
 public
 policy,
 political


science,
 and
 liberal
 arts.
 If
 you're
 one


of
 those
 people
 who
 did
 one
 of
 those


degrees
 at
 school
 and
 you're
 not
 sure


how
 to
 apply
 it
 and
 where
 you
 can
 work


with
 that
 kind
 of
 degree,
 this
 is
 a


fantastic
 opportunity
 for
 you.
 All
 you


need
 to
 do
 is
 to
 upskill
 on
 how
 AI


works.
 You
 don't
 necessarily
 need
 to


code.
 You
 just
 need
 to
 have
 a
 very
 good


understanding
 of
 how
 AI
 models
 get


trained.
 As
 for
 the


salaries
 onto
 the
 data
 science
 and


robotics.
 Now
 what
 is
 this
 field
 about?


Data
 science
 is
 using
 programming
 and


statistics
 to
 extract
 insights
 from
 huge


data
 sets,
 predicting
 customer
 churn,


forecasting
 demand
 or
 flagging
 fraud.


Robotics
 is
 designing
 and
 building


machines
 that
 automate
 physical
 tasks.


From
 warehouse
 bots
 to
 surgical
 robots,


IoT
 is
 about
 connecting
 physical


devices,
 toasters,
 speakers,
 fridges,


cars
 to
 the
 internet
 so
 they
 can
 collect


data
 and
 respond
 to
 their
 environment.


Why
 are
 these
 the
 jobs
 of
 the
 future?


We're
 drowning
 in
 data
 and
 companies
 are


turning
 that
 data
 into
 value.
 Robotics


is
 transforming
 labor
 intensive


industries
 and
 IoT
 is
 creating
 smart


devices,
 smarter
 homes,
 smarter
 cities,


smarter
 factories.
 Demand
 for
 data


scientists,
 robotics
 and
 IoT
 specialists


will
 grow
 as
 automation,
 analytics
 and


device
 networks
 scale.
 Now
 onto
 the


numbers.
 There
 is
 a
 massive
 global


demand.
 The
 robotics
 market
 is
 projected


to
 reach
 310
 billion
 by
 2030
 while
 IoT


is
 expected
 to
 hit
 1.3
 trillion.
 Data


related
 roles
 are
 growing
 36%


yearover-year
 with
 over
 11
 million
 new


data
 and
 AI
 jobs
 expected
 by
 2035.
 Cross


industry
 adoption.
 Robotics
 and
 IoT
 are


scaling
 fast
 in
 logistics,


manufacturing,
 agriculture,
 healthcare,


and
 smart
 cities.
 There
 is
 a
 significant


skill
 shortage
 in
 fields
 such
 as


robotics
 and
 IoT.
 Now,
 let's
 talk
 about


the
 jobs.
 More
 techy
 ones,
 data


scientists.
 They
 build
 predictive
 models


and
 analytics
 pipelines.
 Machine


learning
 engineers,
 they
 develop
 and


apply
 machine
 learning
 models
 to
 solve


big
 problems
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 data.


Robotics
 engineers,
 they
 design
 and


program
 physical
 machines
 and
 control


systems.
 IoT
 architects,
 they
 build
 the


infrastructure
 that
 connects
 and
 secures


smart
 devices
 at
 scale.
 Now,
 onto
 the


less
 techy
 jobs.
 Machine
 learning
 and
 AI


product
 managers.
 Even
 though
 this
 is
 a


less
 techy
 job,
 ML
 and
 AI
 PMs
 are
 still


pretty
 technical
 as
 they
 still
 need
 to


understand
 how
 machine
 learning
 models


work,
 how
 the
 product
 development
 life


cycle
 works
 within
 a ML
 product
 as
 well


as
 to
 stay
 on
 top
 of
 trends.
 But
 an
 AI


product
 manager
 is
 still
 a
 product


manager
 except
 they
 build
 an
 AI
 powered


products.
 AI
 sales
 specialists.
 They


sell
 IoT,
 AI
 or
 robotics
 systems
 to


manufacturers,
 logistics
 companies,


hospitals,
 etc.
 This
 is
 a
 highly


specialized
 sales
 role
 as
 you
 need
 to


understand
 the
 needs
 of
 your
 customers


and
 how
 they
 use
 AI.
 Ask
 for
 the


salaries.
 And
 lastly,
 science
 plus
 tech


such
 as
 biotech,
 climate
 tech,
 or
 health


tech.
 What
 is
 it?
 This
 is
 the


intersection
 of
 science
 and
 tech.
 Pretty


much
 any
 scientific
 field,
 biology,


chemistry,
 or
 physics,
 and
 technology.


Examples
 of
 biotech
 companies
 go
 all
 the


way
 from
 lab
 grown
 meat
 to
 gene
 editing.


Climate
 tech
 builds
 tools
 that
 reduce


carbon
 emission
 or
 adapt
 to


environmental
 changes.
 Think
 carbon


capture,
 energy
 storage
 or
 sustainable


farming.
 Health
 tech
 includes
 digital


diagnostics,
 AI
 assisted
 medicine,


wearables
 and
 tellahalth.
 Why
 is
 it
 the


job
 of
 the
 future?
 The
 global
 health,


food
 systems,
 and
 climate
 tech
 are
 under


strain.
 Tech
 is
 stepping
 in.
 Biotech
 is


accelerating
 drug
 discovery
 and


personalized
 medicine.
 Climate
 tech
 is


racing
 against
 a
 warming
 planet.
 Health


tech
 is
 expanding
 its
 efficiency
 and


access
 in
 care.
 Onto
 the
 numbers,


biotech
 alone
 is
 projected
 to
 hit
 $3.8


trillion
 by
 2030.
 And
 climate
 tech


startups
 raised
 $70
 billion
 in
 VC


funding
 in
 2024.
 Global
 urgency.
 Climate


change,
 aging
 population,
 and
 healthcare


crisis
 are
 driving
 long-term
 investment


in
 science-driven
 tech
 and
 AI


integration.
 AI
 is
 accelerating
 drug


discovery,
 diagnostics,
 energy
 modeling,


and
 sustainability
 products.
 Let's
 talk


about
 the
 jobs,
 more
 techy
 ones.


Biioinformatics
 engineer.
 They
 use


software
 to
 analyze
 genetic
 data
 and


biological
 patterns.
 Climate
 data


scientists,
 they
 model
 climate
 change


scenarios
 and
 predict
 environmental


impact.
 They
 design
 tech
 enabled
 tools


to
 be
 used
 in
 diagnostics,
 monitoring
 or


treatment.
 AI
 researcher
 in
 biotech
 or


climate
 tech
 field.
 They
 apply
 machine


learning
 to
 drug
 discovery,
 diagnostics,


or
 patient
 outcome
 prediction.
 And
 now


onto
 the
 less
 techy
 jobs.
 Specialized


projects
 and
 operations
 managers.
 They


keep
 scientific
 projects
 moving
 across


research,
 engineering,
 and
 product.
 They


coordinate
 biotech
 research
 studies.
 No


lab
 work,
 just
 pure
 specialized
 project


management.
 This
 is
 a
 wonderful
 choice


for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 did
 their
 undergrad


in
 sciences.
 And
 if
 you're
 not
 sure


about
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 next
 in
 life


or
 you're
 not
 sure
 that
 you
 want
 to


pursue
 the
 academia,
 this
 job
 is
 perfect


for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 did
 science
 degrees


and
 perhaps
 you're
 not
 sure
 how
 to
 apply


it
 if
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 into


academia.
 This
 is
 a
 perfect
 intersection


of
 a
 science
 background
 plus
 technical


skills.
 So
 all
 you
 need
 to
 do
 is
 to


upskill
 on
 the
 technical
 side.
 So
 if


you're
 one
 of
 those
 people
 who
 studied


biology,
 physics,
 biochemistry,


chemistry,
 any
 kind
 of
 life
 sciences
 or


even
 mathematical
 sciences,
 but
 you


don't
 want
 to
 go
 into
 pure
 data
 science


or
 IoT,
 science
 plus
 tech
 is
 a
 wonderful


choice
 because
 you
 work
 on
 very


important
 problems
 that
 have
 worldwide


impact.
 as
 for
 the


salaries.
 So
 yeah,
 that's
 the
 list.
 Five


areas,
 dozens
 of
 roles,
 techy
 and
 less


techy,
 but
 all
 growing
 very
 fast.
 I
 hope


this
 was
 helpful.
 Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
