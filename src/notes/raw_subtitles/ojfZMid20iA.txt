Since I was little, I always loved nature.
I always loved the feeling
of being in a forest.
For me, the forest is more
valuable than gold.
My name is Claudia Vega
and I work in the Peruvian Amazon.
I'm studying mercury contamination
due to artisanal gold mining
in Madre de Dios.
I think people are not aware
that sometimes the gold that you buy
maybe is poisoning the rainforest
in the Amazon or other tropical areas.
About 20 percent of the gold
produced in the world
come from artisanal gold mining.
It's not that small.
And when you say artisanal,
it's not because it's natural.
It's called artisanal because
they don't use fancy equipment.
They have a very, like, rustic way.
People have been doing that
since the gold rush in California.
They were using mercury.
So the technique hasn't advanced
that much since then.
Mercury is used because
it's an easy way to extract the gold.
So what the miners do is,
the gold is like, in the sandy form,
and it's usually
in the sediment of the rivers.
They put mercury,
the mercury binds with gold,
then they have the amalgam,
which is a mix of gold and mercury
and then they burn the amalgam.
And then the mercury
just evaporates to the air.
And they got the gold.
When they're doing the mixing with gold,
some of the mercury goes into the river.
It's easy to evaporate,
you don't have to heat it,
it goes to the air,
and it can be transported
like, long distance.
This happens mainly in the tropics
and is the biggest anthropogenic
source of mercury on the planet.
Around 1,400 tons of mercury annually
is released into the environment
because of artisanal gold mining.
It's an international concern.
And it's not because it harms
just the place where it's used.
For example, there are even
very high levels of mercury in the whales,
in the beluga whales, in the Arctic.
In Madre de Dios,
about 130,000 hectares has been deforested
because of artisanal gold mining.
It is a big operation,
you can see huge areas
of rainforest just deforested.
It looked like a desert with mining ponds.
There are artificial lakes.
And in the middle of a lot of desert,
there's no trees, there's no animals.
It looks like the moon, kind of,
because there's no vegetation.
Mercury is an element we cannot destroy.
It is a potent neurotoxin.
It can affect the neurosystem,
it also can give you headaches,
can give you problems with memory.
It can give you insomnia.
It can harm children during pregnancy,
you could have a baby
who will have learning disabilities.
Depending on how much is exposed,
it can even have malformation.
Mercury is called the silent toxin
because it takes a while to show effects.
Minamata Bay in Japan is a more
iconic case of mercury poisoning.
In 1932 there was a company
that was releasing mercury into the bay.
It took about 25 years
to show the effects in people.
About 1,000 people died,
and until now they have certified
like 10,000 people that were affected.
So people didn't know
they were being intoxicated
and they didn't feel it.
But at the end, they had
the symptoms and people died.
WHO says that mercury
is one of the top ten chemicals
that are a major concern
for public health.
Centro de Innovación Científica Amazónica,
which is Amazonian Center
for Scientific Innovation,
we implemented the first mercury lab
in the Peruvian Amazon,
and it's in the middle of the rainforest.
It's in the middle of the jungle.
We produce science.
[We] also communicate the science
to people that are not scientists
in a way that they can have information
to make better decision.
We work with miners and also explain
to them the dangers of mercury
and with Indigenous people,
also explain to them
how they can avoid being exposed.
And also we work with politicians
so they can base
their decisions on science.
Fish is the main source of protein
for Indigenous people in the Amazon.
They are exposed
to very high levels of mercury
through consuming contaminated fish.
They have one of the highest
levels reported right now.
So one thing that we do with them,
we explain to them
that they have to choose safer fish.
Sometimes it's very difficult
because you don't have
the right answer for them.
I mean, they're in their home
and then strange people come,
telling them that what
they are eating is poisoned.
But I think information is power,
and having the right information
may make you do the right decision.
So we insist on that:
give the information
and repeat the information.
Some of the miners tell us,
"I have been doing this
for 30 years, so I'm good."
I asked them like, "Do you sleep?
Do you have headaches?
Do you forget things more often?"
And also mercury sometimes
can increase the chance
of having cardiovascular disease.
So maybe some of the people
have high pressure
and they don't know why.
It could be because of mercury.
And some of them are changing
for a more responsible way of mining.
Some other miners, maybe they know,
but they don't care
because they need money.
And gold is money.
There are not incentives
to produce mercury-free gold.
People just buy gold, they don't care,
there's no good traceability system.
So I think as a consumer
or as a mediator of gold trade,
we have to care about where
the gold is coming from.
Sometimes we use things
and we don't even know
how much impact they have in the world.
At the end, we have
one health, one planet,
and everything is connected.
When you are affecting the environment,
you can affect the animals' health
and then human health, too.
So for me, my dream is like,
people can see the value of the forest.
It's actually doing something for us.
It's producing air, it's producing water.
That's more valuable than gold.
I know gold is valuable,
but you cannot eat it,
you cannot breathe it,
and you cannot drink it.
