- This is a video about
avalanches, what they are,
what causes them, how destructive
ones can be prevented,
and what to do if you're
ever caught in one.
- To actually feel the force
of the avalanche on your body.
There's kind of nothing that
can prepare you for that.
- [Derek] For this video, we followed
around the ski patrollers
at North America's biggest
ski resort, Whistler-Blackcomb
to trigger avalanches
and film them up close.
If you've ever driven through
the mountains in winter
or have gone skiing at a
resort, you were kept safe
by the knowledge gained
by snow scientists,
avalanche forecasters, and ski patrollers.
If you Google the deadliest avalanche,
the first result will be from May, 1970,
when the town of Yungguy
and 10 nearby villages were destroyed.
An estimated 30,000 people were killed,
but the avalanche was triggered
by a 7.9 magnitude earthquake,
and the avalanche caused a
landslide which buried the town.
So it wasn't really avalanche destruction.
The deadliest snow avalanches
happened in December of 1916
during World War I.
Some of the fighting took
place in the Dolomites,
mountain range in northern Italy.
There thousands
of Italian troops were battling
Austro-Hungarian soldiers,
and it had been a
particularly snowy winter.
Over 12 meters
of snow had fallen on the mountain range
in the first week of December.
On the 13th of December,
a single avalanche wiped out
the Austrian barracks near
Mount Marmolada killing
at least 275 people.
But its flow on effects
were far more devastating.
Both sets of troops
realized they could use snow
as a weapon, so soldiers on
both sides fired artillery
shells into the mountain
above their enemy's camps,
deliberately triggering avalanches.
Over the next few days, between 2000
and 10,000 soldiers died
buried underneath the snow.
But most deadly avalanches
aren't triggered by earthquakes
or artillery shells.
They're triggered by skiers, snowboarders,
and snowmobilers recreating
in the backcountry.
93% of fatal avalanches in the US
were triggered by the weight
of the victim or someone
in the victim's party.
So how could something so massive
and destructive be triggered by the weight
of just a single human?
This is Bruce Tremper.
He literally wrote the book
on avalanches, the book,
which inspired us to make this video.
- I was a a hardcore ski racer,
but when I was done racing,
then I started building lifts
for the Bridger Bowl Ski Patrol,
and I got caught in my first avalanche.
My job for that day was tightening
all the bolts at the base
of each chairlift tower.
'Cause we were doing
our load test that day.
So then they'd warn me,
okay, once you get done
with this tower, whatever
you do, don't cross
that big avalanche path below it.
And I made some snide remark like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know
about all that stuff.
Don't worry about me."
When I got done tightening those bolts,
then I realized I made
a really serious error
because I was just
wallowing up to my chest
and I almost needed to take out a shovel
and dig like a tunnel through
the snow to get back up
to the ridge and it was
just exhausting work.
And then I got cocky.
I thought, "Well, I've
heard about these ski cuts.
I can just build up my speed
and get to the other side
'cause that's where I want to be anyway."
Like an idiot, that's what I did.
The first thing that happens
when an avalanche brakes
is it just starts moving
and the first thing you do is
kind of flop over on the snow.
'Cause you lose your balance.
Like somebody pulls the
rug out from underneath you
and you fall uphill.
And there I was just
kinda laying in the snow,
getting dragged down the
mountain, you know, I was caught.
I couldn't get out of it
and luckily I was able
to grab a small tree,
but the snow was just beating me to death,
and just about snapping
off my neck as it's going
by me on this tree.
Luckily a lot of that snow went by
and that's why I didn't die that day.
But then it finally, the
tree finally snapped off
or something happened
and I was tumbling down
the avalanche path.
Luckily when I got to the bottom,
I was only buried up to my chest.
I was in the tail of the avalanche
and the avalanche dies
from the tail first.
So that slows down while
the front part keeps moving.
You know, I had a lot
of time to think about
that for the rest of the day.
Tightening the rest of those bolts
and thinking, holy smokes,
I should, I could have died.
I should have died and I didn't.
- You were tightening bolts,
you were caught in avalanche
and then you went back to
tightening bolts that day.
You like, you went back to work.
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- Good job.
- Well, somebody had to do it.
I was the guy, that was my job.
You know, that's how I
was raised by my father.
You get the job done.
- At the most basic level,
an avalanche happens when
the crystalline bonds
between the snow crystals break
and the force of friction
holding the snow on the mountain
isn't enough to counteract
the pull of gravity.
Avalanches are categorized
by size on a scale of one to five.
One would not be large
enough to bury a person,
but size five would involve
a 100,000 cubic meters
of snow traveling,
many kilometers causing
destruction on a massive scale.
The first thing to note is
that snow isn't uniform.
The snow pack is built
up one storm at a time,
so it's layered and these
layers aren't all the same
and they change over time,
due to the conditions they're exposed to,
the air temperature, humidity, sun, wind,
and rain all affect the
structure of the snow.
For example, after fresh snow has fallen,
if there's a warm sunny
day, the snow will melt
and then refreeze overnight
creating a sheet of ice.
The most important condition
is the temperature gradient
in the snowpack, but we'll come to that.
The snowpack preserves
a record of everything
that has happened to it.
If you dig a pit into the snow,
you can read the different
layers to understand its past.
Nine different avalanche
problems are recognized,
but there are two main
types, slab and loose.
There are two types of
loose avalanches, dry loose,
and wet loose.
The snow in dry loose
avalanches is well, loose.
The snow isn't all stuck together.
So after it's triggered, it fans out.
Sometimes loose avalanches are also known
as point release avalanches.
Dry loose avalanches are commonly
known by skiers as sluff,
and they usually aren't a serious hazard,
though they can drag a skier off a cliff.
- It's funny because like
in the skiing community,
we've just said like this one kind
of avalanche isn't an avalanche,
we just call it something else.
I had a run in with sluff
yesterday, a Helbronner,
and you just feel like this wall
of snow pushing you from the back.
Honestly, it's kind of fun, it's fun.
It's like, it's kind of like
surfing where it's dynamic
and it's moving and you have
to keep moving with the terrain
because you know that yeah,
the sluff his behind you
and if you're not moving fast
enough, it's gonna get you.
- [Derek] Another type of
avalanche is wet loose.
- It typically happens around spring
on like south facing aspects.
The sun heats up the snow
and makes it more dense
and slushy and runny.
The sun's starting to come out.
I'm not currently too worried
about wet loose right now,
but I will be in about an hour.
- [Derek] But the more deadly avalanches
are slab avalanches
where the top layer of
snow becomes stuck together
like a cohesive slab.
When the avalanche is triggered,
the snow releases together in big chunks.
The prevalence of slab avalanches depends
on the angle of the ski slope.
Under 25 degrees, there isn't
likely to be a slab avalanche
because gravity just isn't strong enough
to pull the snow down the mountain.
Any slope steeper than 50
degrees is also unlikely
to have dangerous avalanches.
The slope is so steep that it's hard
for much snow to accumulate.
Regular small sluffs
and slab avalanches prevent
the buildup of larger,
more dangerous slabs.
75% of dangerous slab avalanches occur
between 34 and 45 degrees.
For comparison, a black
diamond ski run is typically
around 30 degrees and a double
diamond is around 40 degrees.
In other words.
- The best conditions for
skiing are also the best
conditions for avalanches.
- [Derek] What's really
terrifying about slab avalanches
is you can trigger them remotely.
You could be skiing
or walking on a slope that
is far less than 30 degrees
and trigger an avalanche on
a steeper slope above you.
And slab avalanches are fast.
They can reach speeds up
to 120 kilometers per hour.
- Friends of mine have
been killed that way.
You just don't realize
how far these cracks can
propagate through the snow.
- [Derek] Slab avalanches
have three parts to them,
bed surface, which is the
lower part of the snow.
Then there is a weak layer
and the overlying slab
The bed surface and the
slab are strong layers.
That is they're made out of
snow that sticks to itself.
The kind of snow that you
can make into a snowball.
The shape of the snow crystals
in strong layers tends to be rounded.
In contrast, the weak layer
consists of snow crystals
that don't readily cohere to one another.
These tend to be more
angular or faceted crystals.
But there are a few
different weak layer types.
One of the most worrying
is known as surface hoar.
It's not made outta snow
that falls from the sky.
It grows on the surface of the snow.
On cold clear nights,
the surface snow radiates
a lot of its heat away becoming
even colder than the air.
Since warm air holds more
moisture than cold air,
that moisture will crystallize at the top
of the snow creating surface hoar.
Surface is formed by condensation.
It's the snow equivalent of dew.
It's really angular and it
doesn't want to stick to itself.
- Usually surface hoar is
then broken down by wind
or sun melting it.
- [Derek] But if a snowstorm occurs,
just after these crystals have formed,
they can become buried.
And in that case, they create
a very nasty, weak layer,
which is just perfect for avalanches.
Another weak layer to worry
about are facets, snow crystals
that used to be round,
but that became angular in the snowpack.
Facets develop when there's
a strong temperature
gradient in the snow.
A thermal gradient of less than one degree
per 10 centimeters does
not produce facets.
Anything more than that can,
which is why the temperature
inside a snow pit is measured.
If there's a large thermal gradient,
there could also be a weak layer
- Right above and right below crust,
there can be really wild
temperature gradients.
So we had it down 10
centimeters, it was minus 5.5
and down 20 it was minus 3.7.
So that's two degree difference.
- [Derek] The bottom of the snow
is warmer than the top of the snow.
So the warmer snow near the ground,
sublimates turning
straight from solid water
into water vapor.
This water vapor rises
up through the snow pack
and then encounters the
colder snow crystals.
At this point, it refreezes
and forms faceted crystals,
which like surface hoar,
don't stick together
creating a weak layer.
- The bigger the change in temperature,
the faster the snow crystals change
and the faster they change,
if they change quickly,
it can promote faceting
which promotes instability.
- [Derek] The other important
factor in slab avalanches
is the stiffness of the slab.
Since the snow is cohesive,
when a force is applied
and the interface between the slab
and the weak layer starts
to slip, that force,
and hence the slippage propagates.
While stiffer slabs might
resist initial triggers better,
their failure leads to more propagation,
leading to larger avalanches.
This also results in more remote triggers.
Avalanches are common after storms.
The extra weight
of the snow exerts an additional
load onto the snow pack,
which can trigger the weak layers deeper
in the snowpack to slide.
The vast majority of
avalanches occur during
or right after a storm, in other words-
- The best conditions
for skiing are also the best
conditions for avalanches.
- Strong winds also increase
the risk of avalanches.
The wind can pick up
and transport the snow from
open to more sheltered areas.
As the snow accumulates,
the wind pressure compacts
these snow particles
as they're deposited, which
creates a dense, cohesive layer.
These newly deposited layers
of snow are called wind slabs.
Wind slabs can be quite
unstable, especially shortly
after formation, if they've
formed over a weak layer.
Since they're more cohesive,
these slabs can break free as large chunks
during an avalanche making
them particularly hazardous.
Another concern are cornices.
Cornices form
when the wind blows snow
over the top of a ridge
and it piles up on the other
side hanging over the edge.
Cornices can weigh many tons
and when they fall onto a slope,
they can trigger massive slab avalanches.
One of the ways that backcountry
skiers test the stability
of the slope they're about to ride
is by dropping a cornice onto it.
If the slope didn't slide
under the weight of a cornice,
it's unlikely to slide
under the weight of a skier.
So how are avalanches
prevented in ski resorts?
For this video, Veritasium
producer Peter, went out
with the ski patrol team
at Whistler-Blackcomb,
which is North America's
largest ski resort.
- Dude, I'm pumped, really
pumped, really anxious,
really stoked, should be a good day.
There are sections in ski resorts
that are avalanche terrain,
slopes that are greater than 30
or so degrees or under avalanche terrain.
To keep skiers safe,
before ski areas open,
the ski patrols do avalanche control work.
Fundamentally, it boils down
to them triggering
avalanches in a safe way
before there are any skiers
on or under those slopes.
This is done often enough
so that the snow doesn't get
a chance to build up too much.
So the avalanches that
are triggered are smaller.
There are a few ways that this is done,
but the most common is
by using explosives.
Explosive charges with a
two minute fuse are lit
and then detonated on the
slopes where they are likely
to produce avalanches.
- Oh boy, really glad
I put on those goggles.
- Sometimes this is done
by throwing the chargers
out of a helicopter,
but a lot of the time
this is done on skis.
There are even special trams
where the chargers are attached
to a carabiner and then shuttled across
to a hard to access slope.
As the charge detonates,
the shockwave breaks the weak
layer leading to an avalanche.
Yes, we got a slide, that wasn't too bad.
It wasn't great.
- It was something.
- It was something.
- [Peter] Despite doing
the shoot the day after one
of the biggest storms of the season,
we weren't particularly lucky
with getting large avalanches.
We shot all morning
and only got this relatively small slide.
So I was getting worried
and then we were able to get this shot.
(upbeat music)
Oh my god, look at that, oh.
Avalanche control work
is also done on roads
with basically the same
idea, trigger avalanches
before they get a chance to
become big and destructive.
For example, the Trans Canada
highway connecting the east
and west coast of Canada goes
through Rogers Pass, a mountain pass
with 3000 meter toll peaks
on either side of it.
The road is right next to a mountain
that's actually called Avalanche Mountain.
Here Parks Canada
and the Canadian Army
conduct avalanche control
by firing artillery shells at one
of the 270 preset targets
on the nearby mountains,
releasing small avalanches
before they get a chance to become big
and destructive and damage the highway.
- [Derek] Deaths from
avalanches do occasionally occur
in bounds at resorts,
but they are very rare.
Due to the diligent
work of ski patrollers,
most avalanche injuries
and deaths occur in the back country.
- It's kind of crazy 'cause as a skier,
you hear so much about avalanches.
(speaker speaking in a foreign language)
- You realize it's deadly
and people die every year.
(speaker speaking in a foreign language)
- But to actually like feel the force
of the avalanche on your body,
like there's kind of nothing
that can prepare you for that.
(snow thudding)
Every time I hit the ground I
would just like dig my hands
in my feet in like try
to like claw myself down onto the ground
while also like trying to protect my head.
I knew also like the
moment the snow stopped,
if I was still in the
snow, I would be buried.
I wouldn't be able to move,
I would be counting on my buddy to find me
and dig me out and save me.
(exhales heavily)
(speaker speaking in a foreign language)
- This wasn't a huge
avalanche, this was a size two,
so like big enough to bury
a car but not like a house.
So I was actually able
to stop on the slope
before it flattened out
where the snow would accumulate
and I would be buried.
(speaker speaking in a foreign language)
- Yeah, it was intense, really intense
and I felt really stupid
because it was the first
mountain I ever skied
on as a kid was this
mountain, like this very slope
and so I was just so comfortable with it
and like didn't think twice about the fact
that it was avalanche terrain and the snow
or, I mean we did check the snow up top,
but I don't know, I
wasn't like fully tuned
into to the dangers that are present.
Like the moment you step
into avalanche terrain,
something like that can happen.
- So the three things that you need
to bring when you go back
country skiing is a beacon,
which is this thing, a probe,
which is this big, long stick
that ends up collapsing.
So it does fit in your
backpack and shovel.
- [Derek] If you're buried
in a slab avalanche,
it's almost impossible
to dig yourself out.
During an avalanche, the
snow gets mixed around
and friction heats it up
so it melts a little bit
and then when the avalanche stops,
it refreezes, setting like concrete.
And that's why if you're fully
buried, you need someone else
to find you and dig you out.
This is why in 1968 the
avalanche beacon was invented.
- The beacon is a transceiver,
so it is both a transmitter
and a receiver of electromagnetic waves
at 457 kilohertz.
So right now it is send mode.
So this is the mode it would be on
if I'm skiing in the backcountry
and if there's an avalanche,
what would happen is
it'll keep sending out
those electromagnetic waves
in all of these directions.
Then my buddies would change
from send mode to search mode
and start looking for that signal.
And what that looks like
is that Aaron is two meters away from me
and her beacon is on
and it's saying, cool,
there's a person two
meters away from me, so.
- Around 25% of avalanche fatalities
are from trauma hitting a tree
or a rock or being pushed off a cliff.
The rest are from asphyxiation.
If you're buried in an avalanche
and your face is under the snow,
there's a small air
pocket for you to breathe.
The snow is initially porous,
but the heat from your body
and breath melts the snow,
which refreezes forming
an impermeable bubble.
As you breathe, the concentration of CO2
in that bubble increases
and the amount of oxygen decreases
until you die from asphyxiation.
If your friends find
and dig you out in the first 10 minutes,
you have an 80% chance of survival.
15 minutes in, that chance drops to 40%,
30 minutes in, you have just
a 22% chance of survival.
So time is key.
There is another invention
that could save your life,
which is an avalanche airbag.
If a skier triggers an avalanche,
they can pull on a cord,
which activates the airbag.
The airbag rapidly inflates.
Historically this was
done with compressed air,
but newer versions use
battery powered fans.
The airbag increases the skier's buoyancy,
making it less likely for them
to be buried deeply in an avalanche.
An added benefit is that
if the skier is buried
as the airbag deflates,
it leaves a larger air
pocket providing more time
to be rescued.
Avalanche airbags decrease
the chances of death
by nearly half.
Around 30 people in the US
die in avalanches each year,
plus an additional hundred in Europe.
Most of them are backcountry
skiers, snowboarders
or snowmobilers,
and they very likely triggered
the avalanche that killed them.
Avalanches are beautiful, majestic,
and completely terrifying.
If you go into the backcountry in winter,
please carry a shovel,
a probe, and a beacon,
but also check the avalanche forecast
and make good decisions when heading out
to avalanche terrain.
Because the best way
to survive an avalanche
is not to be caught in one.
