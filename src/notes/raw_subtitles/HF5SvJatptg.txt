Bloomberg
 Tech
 is
 live
 from
 coast
 to


coast
 with
 Caroline
 Hyde
 in
 New
 York
 and


Ed
 Lelo
 in
 San
 Francisco.


>> This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
 Coming
 up,


escalating
 trade
 tensions
 between
 China,


the
 US,
 and
 now
 Europe,
 too.
 We
 will


discuss
 what
 the
 latest
 trade
 showdown


means
 for
 the
 tech
 sector.


>> Plus,
 concerns
 of
 an
 AI
 bubble
 grow


louder
 among
 global
 fund
 managers.
 We'll


discuss
 the
 valuation
 anxiety
 in
 their


latest
 Bank
 of
 America
 survey.


>> And
 Instagram
 makes
 some
 changes
 with


tighter
 content
 restrictions
 for


teenagers.
 We'll
 discuss
 with


Instagram's
 global
 director
 of
 policy.


>> But
 first,
 to
 check
 in
 on
 these
 public


markets
 and
 once
 again
 anxiety
 returns


to
 the
 four.
 We
 are
 worried
 about
 US


China,
 Europe,
 China,
 and
 the
 trade
 for


tit
 for
 tat
 that
 really
 moves
 out
 into


the
 world
 of
 shipping.
 We're
 down
 9/10


of
 a
 percent
 on
 the
 index
 of
 the
 NASDAQ


100.
 But
 Bitcoin,
 crypto
 in
 the
 eye
 of


the
 storm
 and
 $150
 billion
 wiped
 out
 in


terms
 of
 market
 cap
 across
 the
 industry.


We
 see
 margin
 calls,
 leverage
 flush
 out.


It
 really
 is
 a
 dialup
 of
 worries
 when
 it


comes
 to
 geopolitical
 risk
 here.


>> Okay,
 let's
 get
 to
 our
 top
 story.


Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Besson
 said
 he


still
 expects
 Presidents
 Trump
 and
 Xi


Jinping
 to
 meet,
 though
 China's
 latest


escalation
 in
 that
 trade
 conflict


between
 the
 world's
 two
 largest


economies
 raises
 questions
 about
 all


issues
 can
 be
 resolved
 before
 that


meeting.
 Bloomberg
 senior
 technology


editor
 Mike
 Shepard
 joins
 us.
 Mike,
 what


do
 we
 need
 to
 know?
 What's
 the
 latest
 on


those
 USChina
 trade
 talks?


Well,
 the
 latest
 really,
 Ed,
 is
 that


China
 is
 hitting
 the
 gas
 rather
 than


hitting
 the
 break
 now
 as
 the
 two
 sides


prepare
 to
 meet
 to
 discuss
 these
 ahead


of
 a
 possible
 summit
 between
 presidents


Donald
 Trump
 and
 Xiinping.
 Uh,
 China


earlier
 today
 un
 unveiled
 new
 measures


aimed
 at
 US
 shipping.
 Uh,
 sanctioning
 a


South
 Korean
 company
 with
 strong
 US
 ties


and
 and
 the
 US
 operations
 of
 that


venture,
 Hanwa,
 and
 then
 also
 unveiling


other
 possible
 port
 fees.
 This
 is
 the


latest
 escalation
 in
 an
 area
 where


Beijing
 feels
 like
 it
 has
 an
 advantage


over
 the
 supply
 chain.
 Uh
 China
 is
 the


has
 been
 the
 world's
 largest
 ship


builder
 since
 2017
 and
 it
 follows
 the


last
 week's
 move
 where
 China
 imposed
 new


export
 controls
 on
 sales
 of
 rare
 earth's


minerals
 to
 the
 US
 and
 to
 other


countries
 around
 the
 world.
 Again,


another
 area
 where
 they
 have
 a
 hold
 on


the
 supply
 chain.
 And
 even
 as
 Scott


Bessant
 is
 saying
 that
 he
 sees
 the


prospects
 for
 a
 meeting
 between
 Donald


Trump
 and
 Xiinping,
 he
 has
 also


indicated
 that
 he
 sees
 China's
 moves


against
 rare
 earths.
 And
 he
 hasn't


commented
 yet
 on
 the
 shipping
 decision


by
 China.
 But
 he
 sees
 those
 steps
 as


aiming
 a
 bazooka
 at
 the
 global
 supply


chain.
 And
 it
 is
 not
 the
 tone
 you
 would


expect
 the
 two
 sides
 to
 be
 striking
 as


they
 try
 to
 reach
 some
 sort
 of
 an


agreement.


>> The
 global
 supply
 chain
 is
 key
 here,


Mike.
 Europe
 really
 considering
 what
 its


own
 options
 are,
 where
 leverage
 can
 be


applied
 to
 protect
 its
 own
 manufacturers


because
 the
 rare
 earth's
 implications


are
 large
 for
 them
 too.


The
 rare
 earth's
 implications
 are
 huge


and
 they're
 looking
 at
 it
 at
 a
 number
 of


fronts.
 One
 area
 of
 particular
 concern


of
 course
 has
 been
 uh
 the
 vehicle


industry
 and
 electric
 vehicles
 more


specifically.
 And
 what
 the
 U
 EU
 is


considering
 now
 is
 whether
 to
 require


Chinese
 firms
 that
 want
 to
 operate


within
 the
 block
 to
 share
 technology.


And
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 taking
 a
 page
 from


Beijing's
 own
 playbook.
 Any
 foreign


company
 that
 wanted
 to
 do
 business
 with


the
 Chinese
 partner
 in
 mainland
 China


had
 to
 share
 technology
 with
 that


partner
 as
 really
 the
 price
 of


admission.
 And
 the
 EU
 is
 now
 considering


the
 same
 and
 it
 is
 worried
 because
 it
 is


seeing
 BYD
 make
 such
 inroads
 uh
 into
 the


European
 market
 and
 putting
 some
 of
 the


European
 makers
 and
 their
 own
 EV


ambitions
 in
 jeopardy.
 you
 know,
 it


would
 require
 uh
 not
 only
 the
 sharing
 of


technology,
 but
 this
 also
 joins
 car


other
 steps
 that
 are
 aimed
 at
 trying
 to


rein
 in
 China
 on
 the
 continent.
 And
 that


includes
 a
 doubling
 uh
 last
 week
 of


tariffs
 on
 steel
 imports.
 Clearly,
 a


move
 aimed
 at
 China.
 And
 this
 also


follows
 uh
 something
 that
 we
 were


covering
 very
 closely
 over
 the
 past
 two


days,
 the
 Dutch
 decision
 to
 seize


Nextperia
 from
 its
 Chinese
 owner


Wingtech
 uh
 a
 venture
 uh
 that
 was


subject
 to
 possible
 US
 sanctions.
 We


learned
 today
 if
 it
 did
 not
 replace
 its


Chinese
 CEO
 and
 that
 prompted
 the


government
 uh
 the
 Dutch
 government
 to


move
 and
 to
 seize
 control
 of
 the
 local


venture
 next
 from
 its
 Chinese
 parent.


Bloomberg's
 Mike
 Shepard.
 Thank
 you
 very


much.
 Let's
 get
 more
 details
 on
 the


story
 Mike
 mentioned.
 China
 retaliates


after
 the
 Dutch
 government
 invoked
 a


cold
 war
 era
 law
 to
 take
 control
 of


chipmaker
 Nextperia.
 With
 Beijing
 now


blocking
 Nextia
 and
 its
 subcontractors


from
 exporting
 products
 from
 the
 Asian


nation,
 the
 company
 is
 a
 subsidiary
 of


China's
 Winge
 Technology
 and
 a
 key


supplier
 of
 mature
 chips
 used
 by
 the


automotive
 and
 consumer
 electronic


industries.
 car.
 Now,


>> look,
 these
 US
 China
 trade
 tensions
 and


European
 China
 trade
 tensions
 clearly


weighing
 across
 risk
 assets.
 Most


notably
 though,
 crypto,
 it
 continued
 to


lose
 ground
 after
 a
 historic
 round
 of


liquidations
 that
 triggered
 a
 sharp


sell-off
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Remember,


look,
 Bitcoin
 is
 in
 a
 technical


correction.
 The
 market
 value
 of
 all


cryptocurrencies
 fell
 by
 more
 than
 150


billion
 over
 the
 last
 24-hour
 period,


according
 to
 Coin
 Gecko
 data.
 Person
 we


turn
 to
 is
 Bloomberg's
 Bailey
 Lipils,


who
 covers
 tech
 assets
 for
 us.
 And
 this


is
 washing
 out
 the
 leverage
 from
 the


system.


>> Yeah,
 washing
 out
 the
 leverage.
 You
 have


people
 getting
 margin
 called.
 The
 thing


that's
 interesting
 with
 crypto
 when
 you


talk
 to
 your
 kind
 of
 regular
 Joe
 crypto


trader,
 they
 sometimes
 use
 50
 times


leverage,
 which
 means
 that
 if
 they're


that
 levered
 and
 you
 see
 any
 type
 of


pullback,
 they
 don't
 get
 to
 say,
 "Oh,


actually,
 let
 me
 try
 to
 get
 some
 assets


together."
 They
 immediately
 get
 margin


called.
 That's
 when
 you
 see
 some
 of
 this


leverage
 be
 flushed
 out
 so
 quickly.
 And


this
 comes
 back
 to
 the
 debate
 24/7


trading.
 If
 you're
 asleep
 or
 taking
 a


weekend
 off
 to
 watch
 some
 college


football
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 Bitcoin


pulls
 back,
 well,
 guess
 what?
 Your


portfolio
 just
 got
 blown
 up.
 And
 that
 is


something
 that
 we
 saw
 really
 happen
 and


play
 out
 over
 the
 weekend.
 And
 when
 you


see
 the
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 the
 US
 and


China,
 we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 see


this
 volatility.


Bailey,
 one
 of
 the
 best
 read
 stories
 on


the
 Bloomberg
 terminal
 and
 on
 the


website
 is
 the
 latest
 Bank
 of
 America


fund
 manager
 survey
 and
 in
 particular


the
 focus
 on
 how
 the
 market
 feels
 about


AI
 valuations
 in
 equity
 markets.
 What
 do


we
 need
 to
 know?


>> You
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say
 that
 are
 there


fears
 of
 a
 bubble?
 Uh
 looking
 at
 that


54%
 of
 participants
 in
 that
 October
 poll


pointing
 to
 tech
 stocks
 being
 too


expensive.
 You
 look
 at
 the
 NASDAQ
 100
 uh


forward
 PE
 nearly
 28
 versus
 an
 average


over
 the
 last
 decade
 of
 23.
 So
 all
 signs


do
 point
 to
 overvaluation.
 When
 I
 talk


to
 portfolio
 managers,
 the
 question
 is


where
 are
 you
 allocating
 capital?
 Is
 it


that
 mag
 7
 plus
 broadcom?
 And
 also
 if


we're
 going
 to
 say
 that,
 hey,
 this
 is
 a


market
 that
 could
 be
 overvalued.
 These


are
 investors
 who
 get
 paid
 to
 at least


outperform
 their
 peers.
 So
 when
 you
 see


where
 stocks
 have
 been
 trading
 for
 the


last
 six
 months
 or
 even
 if
 you
 go
 back


to
 that
 April
 bottom
 if
 you
 missed
 out


on
 the
 immediate
 snapback
 you
 kind
 of


continue
 to
 buy
 even
 if
 you
 think
 the


stock
 market
 is
 overvalued
 we
 see


investors
 kind
 of
 bending
 over
 backwards


doing
 some
 mental
 gymnastics
 saying
 okay


well
 maybe
 it's
 overvalued
 on
 the


forward
 price
 to
 earnings
 but
 if
 we


really
 look
 out
 to
 2028
 well
 what
 does


Nvidia
 look
 like
 then
 then
 they're


justifying
 buying
 now
 but
 there's
 so


much
 talk
 about
 froth
 and
 we've
 seen
 it


with
 large
 cap
 tech
 with
 some
 of
 these


smaller
 companies
 I
 often
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


the
 Goldman
 Sachs
 unprofitable
 basket.


That's
 a
 returned
 about
 48%
 year-to


date.
 So,
 quickly
 outstripping
 the
 uh


Magnificent
 7,
 quickly
 outstripping
 the


NASDAQ
 100.
 Is
 that
 a
 short
 squeeze
 or


is
 that
 people
 taking
 on
 risk?
 It's


really
 been
 a
 topic
 of
 conversation


depending
 on
 who
 you
 talk
 to,
 whether


that's
 in
 the
 private
 or
 the
 public


markets.


>> Topic
 of
 conversation
 on
 the
 earnings


calls.
 Look,
 we
 just
 had
 the
 CFO
 of


Cityroup
 being
 asked
 about
 frothy


valuations
 in
 AI.
 This
 is
 focus
 for


institutional
 investors
 as
 well
 as


retail
 investors


>> and
 it's
 undeniable.
 And
 the
 question


is,
 are
 you
 going
 to
 hit
 on
 one
 of
 those


10
 investments?
 I
 look
 at
 a
 company
 like


Oaklow
 in
 the
 nuclear
 space
 up
 470%
 this


year.
 Quantum
 stocks
 are
 up
 hundreds
 of


percents.
 Is
 that
 a
 bet
 on
 these
 being


kind
 of
 the
 next
 wave
 of
 companies
 or
 is


this
 investor
 saying,
 you
 know what,
 if


I
 hit
 one
 out
 of
 the
 12
 companies
 and


Quantum
 ends
 up
 being
 kind
 of
 the
 next


paradigm,
 well,
 at least
 I
 got
 in
 on


Nvidia,
 the
 next
 Nvidia,
 if
 you
 will,
 on


the
 ground
 floor.


>> Which
 is
 the
 biggest
 story
 today?
 the


CFO
 of
 a
 bank
 saying
 something
 quite


measured
 or
 a
 Bank
 of
 America
 survey
 of


all
 the
 fund
 managers
 that
 they
 track.


CFO.
 I
 think
 when
 you
 see
 management


teams
 start
 to
 kind
 of
 grapple
 publicly


with
 the
 idea
 of
 froth
 and
 publicly


discussing
 whether
 they're
 going
 to


outright
 say
 are
 we
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble
 or


not.
 Whether
 you
 want
 to
 ascribe
 a
 lot


of
 value
 to
 what
 we've
 seen
 and
 heard


from
 the
 likes
 of
 Sam
 Alman
 talking


about
 kind
 of
 it
 is
 an
 AI
 bubble
 or
 or


Jeff
 Bezos
 every
 leader
 at
 these
 biggest


companies
 in
 the
 world
 whether
 it's
 tech


giants
 or
 whether
 it's
 the
 seauite
 of


banks
 are
 grappling
 with
 this
 debate
 and


it's
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that
 is
 a


theme
 in
 this
 earning
 season
 whether
 you


want
 to
 talk
 about
 tariffs
 but
 it's


going
 to
 inevitably
 come
 back
 to
 AI


bubble
 valuations
 and
 expectations


because
 there
 is
 so
 much
 debate
 around


the
 cycling
 of
 money
 and
 what
 this


actually


with
 data
 centers,
 buying
 these
 chips,


open
 AI
 partnering
 with
 seemingly


everyone.
 What
 that
 does
 mean
 a
 year


from
 now,
 2
 years
 from
 now,
 was
 this


kind
 of
 the
 buildout
 of
 the
 next


generation
 in
 terms
 of
 AI
 or
 was
 this


something
 that
 we
 all
 kind
 of
 should


have
 seen
 the
 signs
 that
 there
 was
 a


potential
 top?
 Bloomberg's
 Bailey
 Lip


Schultz.
 We're
 big
 Bailey
 Lip
 Schultz


fans
 here
 on
 Bloombo
 Tech.
 Try
 saying


that
 in
 the
 morning
 without
 a
 coffee.


Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 So,
 coming
 up,
 AMD


announces
 a
 new
 agreement
 with
 Oracle


supplying
 even
 more
 AI
 chips.
 We
 have


the
 details
 on
 that
 next.
 This
 is


Bloomberg
 Tech.


[Music]


AMD
 says
 Oracle
 is
 set
 to
 deploy
 50,000


of
 their
 MI450
 chips
 into
 data
 center


computers
 starting
 next
 year.
 It's
 the


latest
 commitment
 in
 the
 AI


infrastructure
 frenzy.
 Here
 with
 the


details,
 Bloomberg's
 Ian
 King,
 who
 leads


our
 coverage
 of
 semiconductors.
 This
 is


an
 important
 deal
 for
 AMD.
 It's
 one
 of


the
 only
 stocks
 on
 the
 socks
 that's
 in


the
 green
 right
 now.
 Um,
 what
 do
 we
 need


to
 know
 about
 it?
 The
 specificity
 of


where
 these
 chips
 are
 going.
 So
 the


first
 thing
 to
 note
 is
 that
 these
 chips


don't
 actually
 exist
 yet.
 These
 are
 new


products
 promised
 for
 next
 year.
 So
 what


this
 is
 is
 another
 affirmation
 that
 AMD


has
 a
 role
 in
 the
 future
 of
 this
 massive


buildout.
 That
 it
 is
 perhaps
 more
 than


just
 an
 alternative
 to
 Nvidia.
 That


people
 are
 actually
 looking
 at
 its


technology
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we'll
 have


some
 of
 that.
 We
 like
 that.
 We're
 going


to
 commit
 at least
 part
 of
 our
 data


center
 build
 to
 that."
 And
 what's


interesting
 is,
 and
 it
 comes
 hot
 on
 the


heels
 of
 course
 of
 OpenAI,
 AMD
 teaming


up.
 Oracle's
 down
 significantly
 today.


They
 got
 AI
 world
 upon
 us.
 But
 how
 much


are
 we
 seeing
 AMD
 reap
 the
 rewards?
 How


much
 will
 some
 of
 these
 be
 built
 out
 in


data
 centers
 and
 the
 margins
 be
 impacted


for
 Oracle
 here?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 we
 we've
 obviously
 saw
 the


massive
 Open
 AI
 announcement
 with
 AMD.


Another
 affirmation,
 a
 separate


affirmation
 from
 this
 that
 hey,
 they've


got
 a
 role.
 Um,
 Oracle
 has
 been
 a


customer
 of
 of
 AMD
 for
 a
 while.
 Um,
 this


gives
 Oracle
 more
 options.
 Obviously,


everybody
 else,
 including
 Oracle,
 is


paying
 um
 most
 of
 their
 money
 to
 Nvidia


right
 now.
 The
 margins
 are
 massive.
 The


prices
 are
 massive.
 So,
 this
 creates
 an


alternative.


>> Let's
 go
 back
 to
 what
 you
 said
 about


these
 chips
 don't
 yet
 exist.
 AMD,
 much


like
 Nvidia,
 has
 future
 generations
 of


their
 GPU
 that
 they've
 designed
 and


announced,
 but
 they're
 not
 yet
 in


production.


How
 do
 we
 best
 understand
 where
 AMD


stands
 in
 this
 market
 for
 this
 lead
 edge


accelerator
 versus
 Nvidia
 in
 the
 next


year
 or
 so?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 best
 way
 to


look
 at
 it
 is
 up
 until
 the
 open
 AI


announcement,
 it
 seemed
 like
 everybody


was
 kind
 of
 AMD
 curious
 that
 they
 were


getting,
 you
 know,
 orders
 which
 were


substantial
 and
 bringing
 in
 um
 a
 good


amount
 of
 money
 for
 the
 company,
 but


compared
 to
 what
 was
 on
 offer,
 compared


to
 what
 was
 happening
 at
 Nvidia,
 really


nothing.
 I
 mean,
 they
 were
 the
 best
 of


of


follow
 a
 group
 that's
 following
 Nvidia.


What
 we're
 seeing
 now
 is
 at
 least
 the


beginnings
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 volume


orders
 and
 these
 future
 commitments


which
 would
 imply
 that
 they
 are
 a


serious
 technology
 provider.


>> Ian
 King
 with
 always
 the
 latest.
 Thank


you
 so
 much.
 Sticking
 with
 chips,
 shares


of
 Samsung
 actually
 sliding
 over
 in
 Asia


trading
 hours
 despite
 the
 company


reporting
 its
 biggest
 quarterly
 profit


or
 expectations
 of
 in
 more
 than
 3
 years.


here
 to
 discuss
 its
 Peter
 Lstrom.
 And


it's
 all
 about
 memory
 and
 demand
 for
 it.


But
 why
 is
 the
 stock
 under
 pressure?


>> Well,
 Samsung
 stock
 has
 really
 been
 on
 a


run
 this
 year.
 It's
 up
 about
 75,
 it
 was


up
 about
 75%
 before
 these
 earnings
 came


out.
 So,
 investors
 are
 taking
 a
 bit
 of


profit
 here
 on
 the
 actual
 news.


Samsung's
 numbers
 were
 pretty
 good.
 This


is
 just
 preliminary
 earnings
 for
 them.


They
 just
 put
 out
 revenue
 numbers
 and


then
 operating
 profit.
 Just
 two
 numbers


so
 far.
 And
 their
 operating
 profit
 was


the
 biggest
 in
 at
 least
 three
 years.
 it


was
 about
 $8.5
 billion.
 So,
 they
 are


making
 more
 money.
 They're
 gaining
 some


traction
 on
 the
 HBM
 side.
 These
 are
 the


memory
 chips
 that
 are
 paired
 with
 the


accelerators.
 But
 you
 were
 talking


earlier
 with
 Bailey
 about
 uh
 some
 of


these
 uh
 uh
 tech
 stocks
 getting
 ahead
 of


themselves.
 Samsung
 is
 one
 of
 those


examples.
 It
 run
 up
 quite
 a
 bit.
 Now,


the
 investors
 are
 taking
 a
 bit
 of


profits,
 but
 the
 numbers
 look
 pretty


strong.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 final


earnings
 from
 them
 later
 on
 in
 the


month.
 We'll
 get
 more
 detail
 about


exactly
 how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 coming
 from


uh
 memory
 chips,
 the
 HBM
 chips
 in


particular,
 how
 much
 from
 smartphones


and
 other
 kinds
 of
 components.
 Samsung


in
 this
 in
 this
 AI
 memory
 chip
 race
 has


been
 behind
 SKH
 Highix,
 its
 local


competitor.
 SKHNX
 has
 been
 very
 good
 at


working
 with
 Nvidia
 in
 particular,
 but


now
 Samsung
 appears
 to
 be
 making
 some


progress.
 We'll
 get
 more
 detail
 on
 that


later,
 but
 it
 does
 look
 like
 they're


making
 some
 progress.


Peter,
 you
 you're
 the
 editor
 that
 leads


our
 coverage
 of
 Asian
 technology,
 right?


How
 do
 we
 cover
 Samsung
 that's
 a
 company


that
 has
 all
 of
 these
 different
 arms
 and


and
 in
 the
 calendar,
 is
 Samsung
 the
 most


important
 Asian
 technology
 company
 right


now?


>> Well,
 we
 got
 a
 big
 week
 for
 uh
 tech


companies
 in
 Asia
 and
 particularly
 chip


companies
 in
 Asia.
 TSMC
 comes
 later
 on


in
 the
 week.
 TSMC
 of
 course
 makes
 chips


for
 everybody,
 but
 particularly
 they're


the
 ones
 who
 actually
 manufacture
 those


chips
 for
 Nvidia
 when
 they
 go
 ahead
 and


sell
 them
 to
 OpenAI
 and
 and
 the
 rest
 of


their
 customers.
 So
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a


biggie.
 In
 between
 we
 have
 ASML
 in


Europe,
 which
 is
 another
 very
 important


uh
 company
 in
 the
 chip
 ecosystem
 because


they
 make
 the
 highest
 end
 chip
 equipment


for
 manufacturing
 these
 high-end
 chips.


So
 both
 of
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be


important
 indicators.
 Samsung
 is
 very


much
 in
 there.
 uh
 recently
 they've
 had


some
 struggles
 as
 they
 fell
 behind
 SKH


Heinix
 in
 the
 memory
 chip
 business
 in


particular.
 It
 looked
 like
 he
 was
 going


to
 run
 away
 with
 this
 market.
 Now


Samsung
 of
 course
 big
 big
 company
 within


South
 Korea
 the
 biggest
 company


historically
 they've
 made
 a
 lot
 of


progress
 in
 terms
 of
 catching
 up.
 So


they're
 important
 and
 together
 Samsung


and
 SK
 Hunix
 give
 you
 an
 indication
 of


how
 the
 AI
 market
 is
 doing.
 So
 both
 of


those
 companies
 are
 partnering
 with


OpenAI
 too.
 As
 you
 mentioned
 earlier,


OpenAI
 seems
 to
 be
 partnering
 with


everybody.
 They
 both
 have
 contracts
 to


be
 able
 to
 supplies
 those
 memory
 chips


as
 open
 AAI
 embarks
 on
 this
 enormous


construction
 project
 to
 build
 more
 data


centers
 across
 the
 US
 and
 beyond
 the
 US.


>> Samsung
 under
 pressure
 and
 you


articulate
 how
 far
 the
 stock
 has
 run
 up


recently,
 but
 is
 there
 any
 implication


from
 the
 dialing
 up
 of
 geopolitical


anxieties
 at
 the
 moment?
 We
 know
 that


China,
 South
 Korea
 are
 getting
 embroiled


from
 a
 shipping
 perspective.
 Peter,
 is


there
 anything
 weighing
 more
 broadly
 on


worries
 that
 Samsung
 will
 be
 engulfed
 in


yet
 further
 tensions
 between
 South


Korea,
 China,
 and
 and
 more
 broadly?


>> There
 are
 certainly
 tensions.
 I
 think


everybody
 is
 watching
 the
 negotiations


between
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 We
 of
 course


had
 that
 flare
 up
 over
 the
 weekend
 where


China
 threatened
 to
 use
 their
 uh
 control


over
 the
 rare
 earth
 elements.
 Um,
 in
 the


trade
 negotiations,
 President
 Trump


responded
 by
 saying
 perhaps
 tariffs


would
 go
 to
 100%.
 I
 think
 that
 concerns


everybody
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 South
 Korea


in
 particular
 and
 Samsung.
 Samsung
 is


one
 of the
 companies
 that
 is
 building


facilities
 within
 the
 US.
 They're
 one
 of


the
 chips
 act
 beneficiaries.
 So
 they're


doing
 construction
 in
 the
 US.
 They
 plan


on
 adding
 a
 lot
 of
 capacity
 here.
 So
 as


the
 Trump
 administration
 uh
 pushes
 for


more
 domestic
 manufacturing,
 they
 seem


to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 beneficiaries
 at
 this


point
 at least.
 They
 of
 course
 make


these
 memory
 chips
 which
 is
 really
 where


they
 make
 uh
 all
 of
 their
 money.
 the


mobile
 phone
 business
 may
 be
 a
 little


bit
 higher
 profile,
 but
 the
 chips


business
 is
 really
 where
 they
 make
 the


the
 profit.
 As
 they
 push
 ahead
 with
 that


and
 they
 work
 more
 with
 TSMC
 and
 Nvidia


on
 those
 memory
 chips,
 that
 should
 help


their
 profits.
 But
 in
 terms
 of
 these


trade
 wars,
 it's
 very
 important
 that


they
 continue
 to
 build
 out
 in
 the
 US
 and


build
 up
 those
 fabs
 that
 they
 have
 in


the
 US.


Bloomberg's
 Peterstrom
 on
 all
 things


Samsung.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Now,


coming
 up,
 we're
 going
 to
 speak
 with


Tonal
 CEO
 Darren
 McDonald
 about
 the


company's
 retail
 expansion
 expansion
 and


its
 push
 to
 infuse
 AI
 into
 all
 of
 its


products.
 That's
 next.
 This
 is
 Bloomberg


Tech.


[Music]


Tonal
 Systems,
 the
 maker
 of
 atome


fitness
 equipment,
 says
 it's
 seen
 a


return
 to
 revenue
 growth,
 fueled
 by


sales
 of
 its
 tech
 infused
 Tonal
 2.
 The


company
 has
 experienced
 a
 turbulent
 few


years
 after
 pandemic
 era
 lockdowns


lifted
 and
 people
 went
 back
 to
 in-person


gyms
 and
 fitness
 classes.
 Let's
 talk


more
 about
 the
 company's
 turnaround


efforts
 with
 Tonal
 CEO
 Darren
 McDonald.


So,
 there
 is
 a
 strategy
 now,
 right?
 A


different
 environment
 to
 say
 2020


through
 2022.
 And
 I'm
 trying
 to
 make


sense
 of
 of of
 what
 links
 it
 all.
 You


seem
 to
 want
 to
 look
 at
 the
 high
 street


a
 little
 bit
 and
 retail.
 What
 is
 your


big
 strategy?


>> Well,
 yeah,
 just
 in
 the
 past
 year,
 we've


actually
 rolled
 out
 from
 19
 locations
 to


over
 100
 locations
 for
 distribution.
 So,


we
 now
 we
 have
 more
 places
 for
 people
 to


see
 and
 touch
 and
 feel
 a
 tonal
 product,


which
 is
 incredible
 because
 we
 have
 75%


NPS
 in
 some
 of
 the
 lowest
 churn
 in
 the


category.
 So,
 giving
 people
 an


opportunity
 to
 actually
 experience
 the


system
 means
 that
 people
 end
 up
 buying.


And
 so,
 just
 we
 want
 to
 really
 focus
 on


that.


>> Tonal
 systems
 are
 still
 higherend.
 And


if
 we
 learned
 anything
 from
 the
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago
 when
 Pelaton
 had
 its
 latest


change
 in
 strategy,


>> people
 are
 still
 very
 sensitive
 to


pricing.
 They
 want
 more
 for
 less.
 What's


your
 strategy
 for
 pricing?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 we
 feel
 like
 we've
 got


the
 world's
 leading
 strength
 training


system.
 It's
 uh
 it's
 a
 personal
 trainer


on
 your
 wall.
 It's
 a
 full
 gym.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 think
 about
 it
 in
 the
 sense
 that


we
 personalize
 all
 the
 weights
 for
 you.


So,
 there
 isn't
 anything
 out
 there
 in


the
 market
 like
 what
 we
 do.
 So,
 the
 fact


that
 we
 can
 personalize
 the
 workout,
 we


can
 uh
 adjust
 weights
 in
 real
 time.


We'll
 move
 weights
 up
 by
 one
 pound
 or


decrease
 it
 by
 one
 pound
 if
 you're
 not


doing
 well,
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 think


about
 it
 at
 all.
 And
 from
 our


perspective,
 because
 of
 our
 platform
 and


the
 way
 it's
 built,
 which
 is
 sits
 on
 top


of
 AI,
 it's
 not
 just
 entertaining
 you.


It's
 really
 a
 strength
 training
 system


that
 works
 with
 you.


>> And
 you
 are
 offering
 more
 to
 those
 that


already
 have
 one
 with
 reformer
 Pilates


options
 being
 built
 in
 Darren
 and


unfolded.
 I'm
 interested
 in
 the


artificial
 intelligence
 part
 of
 it
 that


has
 been
 being
 baked
 into
 everyday


workouts
 on
 the
 tonal.
 How
 are
 you


embracing
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 as
 you
 said,
 Caroline,
 we're


super
 excited
 today
 to
 announce
 the
 fact


that
 we're
 working
 with
 Kristen
 McGee


and
 we're
 announcing
 our
 Pilates
 uh


system.
 You
 know,
 what's
 really
 great


about
 it
 is
 that
 what
 we
 see
 on
 our


platform
 is
 that
 almost
 twothirds
 of
 our


members
 are
 interested
 in
 Pilates,
 but


only
 17%
 of
 them
 are
 actually
 doing
 it.


And
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 pretty
 clear.


you
 know,
 we've
 got
 people
 who
 uh
 have


difficulty
 getting
 into
 classes.
 They're


inaccessible.
 You
 have
 to
 drive
 to
 them.


The
 classes
 are
 are
 are
 often
 difficult


to
 find.
 And
 so,
 we
 rolled
 that
 out
 on


our
 our
 tonal
 system.
 We
 have
 uh
 force


curves
 that
 are
 very
 similar
 to
 what
 a


reformer
 looks
 like.
 So,
 as
 you
 move


further
 away
 from
 from
 the
 uh
 the


machine,
 it
 actually
 increases
 in


resistance
 as
 well.
 It's
 really
 unlike


anything
 that's
 ever
 been
 uh
 offered
 out


there.
 So
 now
 a
 greater
 part
 of
 our


community
 is
 able
 to
 actually
 interact


with
 something
 like
 Pilates.
 And
 so
 you


add
 that
 to
 strength,
 you
 add
 that
 to


yoga,
 you
 add
 that
 to
 the
 cardio
 work


that
 we
 do.
 And
 so
 to
 to
 answer
 your


question
 around
 the
 the
 AI
 component
 of


it,
 we
 think
 we
 have the
 world's
 largest


strength
 dat
 uh
 database.
 So
 we
 have


nearly
 300,000
 members
 lifting
 over


nearly
 300
 billion
 pounds.
 It's
 a


tremendous
 data
 set.
 So
 as
 we
 learn


about
 you
 and
 who
 you
 are,
 we
 can
 look


at
 our
 cables
 and
 say,
 you
 know,


somebody's
 lifting
 certain
 amount
 of


weight,
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 reps,
 force,


velocity,
 range
 of
 motion,
 all
 of
 those


things,
 which
 helps
 us
 to
 define
 what


outcomes
 could
 look
 like
 for
 somebody.


So
 people
 get
 stronger
 on
 tonal
 than
 any


other
 system.


>> It
 is
 a
 premium
 offering.
 Would
 you
 ever


think
 about
 having
 cheaper
 offerings
 or


just
 the
 application
 as
 we've
 seen
 with


Pelatin,
 for example?


Yeah,
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 anything
 to


announce
 today,
 but
 we're
 certainly


looking
 at
 alternative
 uh
 opportunities


for
 for
 our
 hardware.
 I
 mean,
 we
 could


move
 upstream,
 we
 could
 move
 downstream,


but
 again,
 I
 would
 just
 refer
 back
 to


the
 fact
 that
 nobody
 has
 anything
 quite


like
 what
 we
 have.


>> Just
 very
 quick
 before
 we
 let
 you
 go,


you
 know,
 you've
 raised
 money
 in
 the


past.
 Would
 you
 raise
 money
 just
 to
 keep


growth
 going
 or
 what
 would
 the
 rationale


be?


>> Sure.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 always
 looking
 to


fuel
 growth.
 So,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of


uh
 developing
 new
 hardware,
 in
 terms
 of


acquiring
 new
 customers,
 expanding
 any


new
 modalities
 as
 we're
 announcing


today,
 we
 think
 there's
 an
 opportunity


for
 us
 to
 keep
 that
 keep
 that
 going.


Keep
 that
 going.
 We
 really
 appreciate


it.
 Darren
 McDonald,
 CEO
 of
 Tonal
 on
 the


latest
 announcement
 when
 it
 comes
 to


reformer
 Pilates
 and
 the
 growth
 story.


But
 coming
 up
 and
 we
 got
 so
 much
 more
 to


discuss
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Salesforce's


Dreamforce
 conference.
 Kicks
 off
 today.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Mayhabib


of
 writer
 and
 Mattis
 Stanuzki
 of
 11


Labs.
 This
 is
 all
 about
 the
 integration


of
 AI
 and
 the
 future
 of
 enterprise


software.
 Basically,
 Ed,
 today
 the
 key


question
 is
 what
 are
 we
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble?


How
 much
 therefore
 are
 we
 seeing
 a


return
 on
 AI
 investment
 in
 the


enterprise?
 Look
 at
 what
 the
 impact


though
 is
 of
 China
 and
 the
 US
 as
 well.


>> Funny
 day
 in
 the
 markets.
 So,
 we're
 down


about
 a
 percentage
 point
 on
 the
 NASDAQ


100.
 I'm
 I'm
 still
 recovering
 from


Friday
 where
 the
 president
 broke
 that


news
 at
 the
 top
 of
 our
 show
 and
 then


markets
 went
 into
 freeall,
 but
 the


blanket
 theme
 is
 the
 same.
 anxiety
 about


trade
 and
 unknowns
 about
 the


relationship
 between
 the
 United
 States


and
 China,
 particularly
 in
 the
 context


of
 technology.
 The
 outlier
 AMD
 doing


deals
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 This
 is


Bloomberg
 Tech.


[Music]


Welcome
 back
 to
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
 I'm


looking
 at
 the
 markets
 and
 here
 are
 some


technology
 stories
 we
 haven't
 got
 to


yet.
 The
 first
 is
 Walmart
 up
 almost
 3%.


What
 do
 you
 think
 it
 is?
 It's
 a


relationship
 with
 Open
 AI,
 an
 API


integration
 into
 Chat
 GPT,
 sending
 the


stock
 high
 just
 like
 we
 saw
 with
 a


number
 of
 names
 at
 OpenAI
 dev
 day.


Walmart
 is
 the
 latest
 to
 do
 a
 deal
 in


the
 e-commerce
 context
 through


integration
 in
 chat
 GPT.
 Also,
 the
 chip


sector.
 So,
 we
 talked
 about
 AMD.
 AMD's


paired
 some
 of
 its
 gain
 relating
 to
 the


Oracle
 deal
 which
 Ian
 King
 explained
 to


us
 is
 separate
 from
 that
 open
 AI


arrangement.
 On
 the
 downside
 is
 Nvidia


down
 3.6%.
 It
 fell
 in
 recent
 days


because
 of
 the
 tensions
 with
 China.
 I


don't
 really
 see
 a
 specific
 piece
 of


news
 or
 a
 catalyst
 that's
 driving
 this


down
 lower.
 There
 was
 of
 course
 the


Broadcom
 and
 Open
 AI
 A6
 news
 of


yesterday.
 They're
 all
 names
 we
 track


cuz
 they're
 moving
 the
 markets.
 carrot


and


>> let's
 talk
 about
 the
 moves
 in
 the
 market


just
 of
 late
 in
 the
 valuations
 that


they're
 at
 Ed
 because
 global
 fund


managers
 they
 are
 sounding
 the
 alarm


bells
 on
 AI
 stocks
 with
 a
 record
 share


more
 than
 half
 saying
 they're
 in
 a


bubble.
 It's
 all
 according
 to
 the
 survey


by
 Bank
 of
 America.
 Meanwhile,
 over
 at


Croup
 CFO
 Mark
 Mason
 also
 out
 with
 a


warning
 when
 questioned
 by
 analysts


saying
 that
 there
 is
 signs
 of
 frothiness


in
 AI
 valuations.
 Let's
 get
 to


Bloomberg's
 equities
 reporter
 Ron


Vastelica.
 I
 mean
 the
 noise
 is
 becoming


deafening.


>> Absolutely.
 We
 have
 heard
 almost
 daily


warnings
 from
 people
 about
 overvaluation


in
 AI
 stocks,
 some
 kind
 of
 bubble


brewing,
 concerns
 about
 sort
 of
 the


circular
 nature
 of
 some
 of
 these


financing
 deals,
 a
 lack
 of
 detail
 that


people
 want.
 Yeah,
 certainly
 there's
 a


growing
 growing
 concern.
 Although
 I
 also


would
 say
 there
 continues
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


optimism
 about
 the
 long-term
 path
 of
 AI,


the
 long-term
 productivity
 enhancements


it
 is
 expected
 to
 deliver.
 There's
 still


a
 lot
 of
 optimism
 that
 these
 companies


will
 eventually
 see
 some
 pretty
 amazing


returns
 from
 all
 the
 investments
 they're


making.
 So
 certainly
 a
 lot
 of
 bulls,
 but


also
 a
 lot
 of
 bears.


Ryan,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 headlines
 around


Salesforce
 on
 the
 terminal
 today.
 Many


positive,
 but
 the
 stock's
 down
 almost


2%.
 One
 I
 see
 that
 you
 filled
 with
 the


team
 is
 that
 Salesforce
 has
 been
 cut
 at


Northland.
 What's
 that
 analyst
 saying?


I
 believe
 he
 was
 uh
 discussing
 a
 lack
 of


real
 growth
 acceleration
 from
 his
 agent


force
 AI
 product.
 He's
 not
 seeing
 it


showing
 up
 and
 CRPO
 that's
 current


remaining
 performance
 obligations.
 He's


not
 seeing
 it
 show
 up
 and
 average


revenue
 per
 user.
 Now
 Salesforce
 does


have
 its
 agent
 force
 event
 today.
 I


haven't
 been
 able
 to
 to
 monitor
 it.
 So


we
 are
 hoping
 to
 see
 you
 know
 some
 new


details
 maybe
 about
 adoption
 if
 they


give
 any
 kind
 of
 insight
 into
 how
 much


uh
 revenue
 growth
 they're
 seeing
 from


this
 overall
 adoption
 rates.
 I
 mean


that's
 all
 going
 to
 be
 very
 critical
 for


the
 stock.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 those
 software


companies
 that
 has
 really
 been


struggling
 this
 year
 even
 amid
 all
 the


AI
 optimism.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 software


companies
 that
 have
 really
 been
 sort
 of


struggling
 against
 the
 perception
 that


maybe
 uh
 you
 know
 AI
 native
 companies


notably
 open
 AI
 are
 these
 companies


going
 to
 really
 represent
 some
 kind
 of


competition
 to
 them
 that's
 very


difficult
 to
 shake.
 So
 people
 looking
 to


this
 event
 today
 uh
 really
 as
 an


opportunity
 to
 help
 counter
 that


narrative.


>> Blue
 Most
 Ryan
 Felica
 thank
 you
 very


much.
 Now,
 as
 Wall
 Street
 debates


whether
 AI
 stocks
 are
 heading
 into


bubble
 territory,
 Salesforce
 is
 doubling


down
 on
 the
 technology,
 Dreamforce
 2025


kicks
 off
 today,
 bringing
 together


celebrities
 and
 tech
 leaders
 to
 explore


the
 future
 of
 AI
 in
 the
 world
 of


enterprise.
 Among
 the
 featured
 speakers,


11
 Lab
 CEO
 Matty
 Stanniski
 and
 writer


CEO
 Mayh
 Khabib,
 who
 will
 appear


together
 on
 a
 panel
 titled
 Rewriting
 the


Enterprise
 Playbook
 with
 AI.
 pleased
 to


say
 they
 both
 joined
 us
 now
 here
 in
 San


Francisco.
 May
 I'll
 start
 with
 you.
 You


heard
 what
 Ryan
 just
 said.
 I
 know
 writer


to
 be
 uh
 an
 LLM
 focused
 company,
 agentic


AI
 focused
 company
 for
 the
 enterprise.


Either
 you
 beat
 Salesforce
 at
 that
 or


you
 work
 with
 them
 at
 that.
 Which
 is
 it?


>> Yeah.
 What
 we
 do
 is
 help
 companies


rewire
 operations
 to
 be
 AI
 native.
 And


so
 partnerships
 with
 companies
 like


Salesforce
 are
 really
 important
 part
 of


that.
 So,
 it's
 definitely
 the


partnership
 angle,
 but
 there
 is


something
 to
 be
 said
 around
 doing
 things


AI
 native
 and
 and
 being
 able
 to
 start


with
 a
 blank
 sheet
 of
 paper
 versus,
 you


know,
 layering
 on
 a
 Gentic
 into,
 you


know,
 a
 system
 of
 record
 that
 has


existed
 for
 a
 while.
 Yeah,
 you've
 kind


of
 wanted
 to
 build
 it
 from
 the
 ground


up,
 May,
 but
 I
 turn
 therefore
 to
 Matty.


And
 when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the
 audio


applications
 of
 artificial
 intelligence,


we've
 had
 you
 on
 the
 show
 to
 think
 about


how
 now
 music
 can
 be
 created
 by
 just


writing
 in
 a
 few
 key
 prompts.
 How
 are


companies
 adopting
 11
 Labs
 appropriately


with
 a
 return
 on
 that
 investment?
 Is
 it


with
 a
 salesforce
 or
 is
 it
 from
 the


ground
 up?


>> Caroline,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 here.
 The


we
 we've
 seen
 an
 incredible
 shift
 over


the
 last
 year
 where
 the
 combination
 of


voice
 and
 conversational
 agents
 can


elevate
 a
 customer
 experience
 for


customers
 across
 Fortune
 500
 all
 the
 way


to
 to
 some
 of
 the
 highest
 scaling


startups.
 Um,
 we've
 seen
 both.
 We've


seen
 companies
 built
 using
 some
 of
 the


best
 and
 breed
 technologies
 including


voice
 like
 you
 said
 all
 relying
 on
 the


entirety
 of
 the
 of
 the
 platform.
 Uh
 we


are
 thrilled
 to
 be
 here
 at
 Dreamforce


and
 as
 part
 of
 the
 the
 work
 we
 do
 um
 be


part
 of
 the
 voice
 for
 agent
 force


powering
 that
 that
 work
 across
 across


their
 platform.
 So
 we've
 seen
 both
 and


um
 and
 across
 the
 enterprise
 segment


quick
 adoption
 in
 that
 sector.
 May
 we


have
 loved
 how
 outspoken
 and
 clear


you've
 been
 in
 pushing
 back
 on
 perhaps


these
 narratives
 of
 95%
 of
 all
 AI
 pilots


aren't
 working
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


MIT
 report
 that
 really
 rocked
 the
 market


but
 it's
 about
 nuance
 in
 this


conversation
 may
 so
 bring
 us
 that
 nuance


of
 when
 is
 it
 working
 when
 they're


adopting
 writer
 either
 from
 the
 ground


up
 or
 indeed
 within
 Salesforce
 offerings


yeah
 AI
 is
 not
 another
 software
 upgrade


you
 can't
 outsource
 it
 to
 the
 CIO
 and


expect
 results
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we


do
 is
 go
 to
 executives
 and
 CEOs
 and
 say,


"Look,
 this
 is
 about
 you."
 Sometimes
 you


kind
 of
 want
 to
 shake
 them
 like
 this
 has


got
 to
 be
 a
 top-down
 very
 heavy
 mandate


to
 rewire
 processes
 end
 to
 end.
 If
 you


leave
 it
 up
 to
 people,
 a
 lot
 of
 what


they're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 is
 personal


productivity
 stuff
 with
 AI
 versus
 the


high
 lever
 things
 that
 executives


certainly
 want.
 And
 as
 you've
 seen
 in


terms
 of
 what
 the
 market
 wants
 and
 this


continued
 investment
 in
 AI,
 what
 people


are
 expecting
 from
 this
 enterprise


investment.


>> Matty,
 what
 you
 and
 May
 have
 in
 common


is
 your
 private
 companies,
 you're
 free


from
 the
 scrutiny
 that
 public
 companies


are.
 But
 in
 the
 last
 segment,
 we
 talked


about
 how
 some
 of
 the
 analysts
 that


cover
 Salesforce
 are
 skeptical
 um
 about


uh
 agent
 force
 in
 particular.
 You've


just
 said
 to
 us,
 both
 of
 you,
 we


actually
 do
 see
 adoption
 in
 the


enterprise.
 So
 what
 does
 that
 tell
 you


if
 the
 data
 for
 their
 product


specifically
 isn't
 as
 strong?


Look,
 the
 the
 our
 focus
 is
 predominantly


on
 on
 working
 across
 our
 work
 at
 11
 Labs


and
 we've
 seen
 um
 use
 cases
 across


e-commerce
 elevate
 where
 where
 you


suddenly
 can
 not
 only
 have
 customer


support,
 you
 have
 customer
 experience


where
 users
 going
 into
 the
 product,


going
 into
 the
 site
 will
 be
 able
 to


interact
 with
 agents
 to
 help
 you
 shop


through
 the
 product
 all
 the
 way
 from
 the


start.
 It's
 a
 good
 company
 in
 Mobilaria,


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 in
 Italy
 working
 on


use
 cases
 like
 this.
 And
 we've
 seen
 this


um
 scale
 across
 across
 wider
 degree
 of


of
 segments
 in
 financial
 services
 and
 um


and
 and
 technology
 and
 healthcare.
 Um


what
 I
 think
 is
 is
 is
 is
 true
 and
 key
 as


you
 think
 about
 Salesforce
 um
 their


distribution
 across
 clients
 of
 course


stretches
 uh
 uh
 all
 all
 types
 of


industries
 and
 including
 regulated


industries.
 So
 it
 will
 take
 a
 a
 slightly


longer
 time
 to
 that
 bring
 a
 lot
 of
 the


technology
 into
 those
 industries
 where


uh
 where
 additional
 deployment


additional
 integrations
 to
 existing


stack
 are
 slightly
 more
 complex
 to
 some


of
 the
 companies
 in
 uh
 in
 the
 space.
 May


when
 you're
 both
 on
 stage
 with
 each


other
 later
 today,
 what's
 kind
 of
 the


one
 key
 thing
 you
 want
 to
 get
 across


about
 what
 is
 happening
 among
 your


enterprise
 customers
 at
 the
 moment?
 What


you're
 fighting
 with
 each
 day
 or
 what


you're
 most
 focused
 on?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 we're
 hosts
 of
 Salesforce,


right?
 They
 are
 wonderful
 partners.
 And


I
 think
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 we
 want
 to


impart
 to
 that
 audience
 is
 how
 do
 you


make
 the
 most
 out
 of
 your
 data


investment
 with
 Agentic
 AI.
 And
 I
 think


both
 of
 us
 have
 got
 companies
 where


enterprises
 are
 getting
 real
 ROI
 right


from
 our
 products
 and
 really
 helping


bring
 that
 to
 the
 data
 they've
 got
 in


the
 Salesforce
 ecosystems
 is
 going
 to
 be


one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 talk
 about.
 And


what's
 so
 interesting
 really,
 Matty,
 has


been
 the
 ongoing
 anxiety
 among
 that


enterprise
 workforce
 about
 whether


they're
 being
 augmented
 or
 whether


indeed
 they're
 being
 replaced.
 How
 have


you
 continued
 to
 try
 and
 tell
 that


story,
 particularly
 when
 you're
 in
 the


world
 of
 music,
 of
 of
 of
 IP,
 of
 real


individuality
 and
 creativity.


>> For
 us,
 it's
 extremely
 important
 to
 work


with
 the
 industry
 together.
 So
 our
 music


is
 the
 the
 first
 fully
 licensed
 AI
 music


model
 at
 incredible
 quality
 working
 with


our
 research
 team
 and
 that's
 the


approach
 we've
 taken
 across
 voice
 across


music
 across
 as
 we
 build
 conversational


agents
 but
 like
 you
 say
 AI
 is
 bringing


change
 and
 the
 way
 that
 we
 seen
 this


across
 uh
 across
 enterprise
 across
 the


companies
 we
 work
 with
 is
 people
 using


AI
 will
 be
 the
 people
 that
 um
 will


unfortunately
 replace
 people
 not
 using


AI.
 So
 that
 adoption
 both
 in
 the


enterprise
 setting
 and
 across
 the
 wider


global
 setting,
 it's
 all
 about
 uh
 being


the
 user,
 trying
 it
 out
 and
 and
 bringing


that
 to
 uh
 to
 your
 work.


>> And
 may
 when
 you
 come
 on,
 we've
 always


been
 very
 keen
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 your


growth
 trajectory,
 but
 also
 the
 halves


and
 the
 have
 nots
 in
 the
 space.
 How
 much


you
 still
 having
 companies,
 smaller


companies
 call
 you
 up
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we'd


like
 to
 team
 with
 you.
 We'd
 like
 to


offer
 you.
 We'd
 like
 to
 have
 some
 sort


of
 buyout."
 Are
 you
 seeing
 that
 coming


from
 VCs
 just
 being
 more
 discerning,


putting
 money
 for
 the
 winners,
 but


taking
 away
 from
 those
 that
 aren't


hitting
 scale?


>> The
 the
 bar
 for
 sharp
 differentiation


has
 never
 been
 harder.
 I
 think
 with
 the


hyperscalers
 just
 flooding
 the
 zone,
 it


has
 been
 such
 a
 challenge
 to
 make
 sure


the
 enterprise
 understands
 what's
 real,


what's
 what.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 just


getting
 harder
 for
 smaller
 startups
 to


enter
 the
 enterprise
 as
 a
 result.
 You


know,
 we
 were
 lucky
 in
 that
 we
 started


building
 LLMs
 for
 the
 enterprise
 5
 years


ago.
 And
 so,
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 long-standing


relationships,
 you
 know,
 have
 been
 a


result
 of
 why
 we
 land
 new
 customers
 um


in
 in
 these
 spaces.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 is


just
 getting
 harder
 because
 of
 the


hyperscaler
 um
 investment.
 But
 there's


just
 so
 many
 categories.
 The
 enterprise


needs
 so
 much
 help
 and
 people
 are
 not


focused
 on
 it
 the
 way
 that
 startups
 can.


So,
 still
 a
 ton
 of
 opportunity,
 but


yeah,
 absolutely
 getting
 harder.
 and
 we


love
 having
 both
 of
 you
 on
 to
 talk
 about


that
 opportunity.
 We're
 excited
 to
 hear


from
 you
 at
 Elsforce
 Dreamforce
 as
 well.


A
 little
 bit
 later,
 Mayab
 as
 well.
 Matty


Stenuzi,
 we
 appreciate
 you
 a
 writer
 and


11
 Labs.
 Coming
 up,
 Tara
 Hopkins,
 global


director
 of
 policy
 at
 Instagram,
 joins


us
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 company's
 new
 PG-13


content
 restrictions
 for
 teen
 users.


That's
 next.
 This
 is
 blue
 bag
 tech.


[Music]


Instagram
 will
 prevent
 teens
 from
 seeing


content
 deemed
 inappropriate
 for
 PG-13


audiences.
 It's
 a
 new
 move
 following


Instagram's
 launch
 of
 teen
 accounts
 last


fall.
 And
 that
 already
 offers
 stricter


settings
 and
 comes
 as
 its
 parent
 company


Meta
 and
 indeed
 the
 wider
 social
 media


industry
 really
 battle
 the
 narrative


that
 they
 expose
 young
 people
 to


dangerous
 content.
 So
 let's
 get
 the


details.
 Instagram's
 global
 director
 of


policy
 Tara
 Hopkins
 I'm
 pleased
 to
 say


is
 here
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 in
 a


nutshell
 explaining
 what
 teen
 accounts


now
 provide.
 You've
 added
 on
 new
 updates


today.
 How
 are
 we
 restricting
 content?


So
 Caroline,
 as
 you
 said,
 just
 to
 take
 a


step
 back,
 we
 launched
 Teen
 accounts
 in


the
 US
 and
 now
 globally.
 Um,
 last
 year,


Teen
 Accounts
 was
 to
 address
 the
 three


things
 that
 parents
 were
 most
 concerned


about
 about
 their
 young
 people
 using


Instagram.
 It
 was
 about
 unwanted


contact.
 It
 was
 about
 the
 time
 they're


spending
 on
 our
 app,
 and
 it
 was
 about


inappropriate
 content
 and
 minimizing
 the


amount
 of
 inappropriate
 content
 a
 teen


would
 see
 on
 Instagram.
 What
 the
 update


is
 today
 is
 specifically
 about
 that


inappropriate
 content
 piece
 of
 this


because
 we're
 continually
 learning
 from


parents.
 And
 what
 they
 told
 us
 was
 they


were
 a
 little
 bit
 confused
 about
 the


different
 settings
 and
 the
 different


controls.
 They
 were
 a
 little
 bit


confused
 about
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 what


is
 age
 appropriate
 or
 what
 you
 know
 how


we
 age
 gate
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 you
 know


tech
 speak
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 parents
 just


don't
 really
 understand.
 So
 what
 we've


done
 is
 we've
 revamped
 teen
 accounts
 to


be
 guided
 by
 PG-13
 movie
 ratings.
 Really


trying
 to
 speak
 the
 language
 of
 parents


who
 are
 much
 more
 familiar
 with
 the


movie
 rating
 movie
 rating
 standards.
 And


we're
 as
 of
 today,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


rolling
 out
 to
 all
 teenagers
 under
 the


age
 of
 18
 who
 are
 defaulted
 into
 this.


So
 they
 can't
 opt
 in
 or
 opt
 out,
 we're


going to
 be
 moving
 them
 into
 the
 teen


account
 experience
 over
 the
 course
 of


the
 next
 few
 months.


>> And
 when
 you're
 deciding
 whether
 content


or
 a
 content
 creator
 is
 generally
 PG-13


or
 not,
 using
 artificial
 intelligence


for
 that,
 how


>> we
 do
 we
 use
 artificial
 intelligence.
 So


the
 first
 thing
 we
 did
 was
 we
 reviewed


our
 policies,
 all
 the
 guidelines
 we
 had


around
 what
 is
 inappropriate
 content
 for


a
 team.
 So
 what's
 what's
 appropriate
 for


a
 team?
 So,
 we
 did
 that
 review
 um
 on
 on


Instagram
 and
 then
 what
 we've
 done
 is


we've
 built
 the
 classifiers,
 our
 our


technology,
 the
 AI
 that
 we
 we
 use
 and


we've
 retrained
 it
 on
 some
 of
 these
 new


roles
 and
 rules
 and
 tweaks
 and


adaptations
 we've
 made
 to
 the
 policies


that
 then
 goes
 out
 across
 the
 system
 and


then
 we
 we
 find
 content
 that
 we
 don't


believe
 to
 be
 in
 that
 PG-13
 movie
 rating


kind
 of
 space,
 we
 will
 either
 hide
 it


from
 teams
 or
 we'll
 remove
 it
 entirely.


Tara,
 there's
 still
 questions
 about
 from


a
 how
 the
 technology
 and
 from
 a
 policy


perspective
 you
 define
 what
 is
 or
 what


is
 not
 PG-13.
 So,
 could
 you
 answer
 that


more
 specifically
 for
 on
 a
 postby
 post


basis?
 How
 is
 a
 decision
 made
 this
 is
 or


this
 is
 not
 PG-13?


>> Yes.
 So,
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 we
 don't


rate
 if
 you're
 on
 Instagram
 and
 how
 how


this
 is
 going
 to
 look
 and
 feel
 if
 you're


uh
 a
 teenager
 on
 Instagram.
 Now,
 first


of
 all,
 we're
 going to
 be
 sending
 a


notification
 at
 the
 top
 of
 your
 feed
 for


teenagers
 to
 let
 them
 know
 what
 we're


doing
 here,
 to
 let
 them
 know
 that
 we're


going
 to
 be
 aligning
 and
 guided
 by
 PG-13


ratings.
 Um,
 what
 it
 will
 look
 and
 feel


like
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 a
 parent
 is


hopefully
 that
 they
 will
 understand,


again,
 we're
 going to
 be
 sending


notifications
 to
 parents.
 Again,
 really


trying
 to
 speak
 the
 language
 of
 parents.


What
 we've
 done
 is
 we've
 made
 some


changes
 to
 the
 policies
 so
 that
 if


you're
 thinking
 about
 a
 PG-13
 movie,
 um,


that's
 the
 kind
 of
 experience
 your


team's
 going
 to
 have.
 So,
 what
 a
 good


example
 of
 that
 would
 be
 around
 cursing.


So,
 profanity.
 Um,
 we've
 always
 had


rules
 around
 profanity
 on
 on
 Instagram.


And
 there's
 certain
 things
 you
 can
 and


can't
 say.
 But
 on
 a
 PG-13
 movie,
 they


have
 very
 very
 specific
 standards
 around


this.
 You
 can
 use
 one
 or
 two
 quite


strong
 curse
 words
 and
 then
 other,
 you


know,
 less
 less
 more
 minor
 curse
 words.


So,
 what
 we
 did
 is
 we
 looked
 at
 this.


We're
 not
 apples
 for
 apples,
 of
 course,


you
 know,
 we're
 a
 social
 media
 company


as
 opposed
 to
 making
 movies,
 but
 we


thought,
 what
 would
 be
 the
 equivalent
 on


Instagram?
 The
 equivalent
 on
 Instagram


is
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 recommending


content
 to
 teens
 that
 has
 severe
 what
 we


would
 describe
 as
 severe
 curse
 words.


So,
 we
 train
 the
 AI
 to
 find
 those
 types


of
 curse
 words
 and
 we
 will
 remove
 them


so
 that
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be


recommending
 that
 kind
 of
 content
 to


teens.


>> Tara,
 what
 other
 protections
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 doing
 additionally
 going


forward?


>> So,
 we're
 also
 announcing
 today
 two


further
 things.
 One
 is
 that
 we're
 going


to
 be
 giving
 parents
 more
 control
 if


they
 wish
 to.
 So
 again,
 these
 um
 this


update
 is
 for
 all
 teens
 under
 the
 age
 of


18.
 When
 we
 know
 you're
 under
 the
 age
 of


18,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 moved
 by
 default


into
 the
 PG-13
 or
 the
 plus
 13
 setting
 on


Instagram.
 Um
 that's
 the
 first
 thing.


But
 if
 a
 parent
 wants
 to
 go
 that
 step


further,
 uh
 we're
 really
 going
 to
 help


parents
 to
 do
 that.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 um


additional
 one
 of
 the
 other
 things
 we're


doing
 announcing
 today
 is
 that
 we
 will


have
 um
 limited
 even
 more
 limited


content
 control.
 Parents
 can
 go
 in
 and


they
 can
 have
 a
 look
 at
 that.
 They
 can


talk
 to
 their
 teen,
 have
 a
 conversation


with
 them.
 Particularly
 if
 your
 teenager


is
 in
 that
 younger
 category,
 you
 might


want
 to
 limit
 the
 content
 even
 further.


You
 got


>> Yes.


>> Briefly,
 you
 got
 tens
 of
 millions
 of


teen
 accounts.
 How
 many
 are
 trying
 to


opt
 out,
 navigate
 those
 age
 rules?
 How


are
 you
 ensuring
 that
 they
 do
 remain


within
 those
 age
 catchments?


>> So,
 we
 now
 have
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


teens
 in
 the
 teen
 account
 experience,


which
 which
 has
 been
 which
 we
 launched


last
 year,
 which
 is
 really
 good
 news.


We've
 been
 able
 to
 do
 that
 technically,


which
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 challenge
 to
 be


able
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 know
 that
 97%
 of


teens
 that
 we've
 moved
 into
 the
 teen


account
 experience
 have
 not
 tried
 to


change
 those
 more
 protective
 settings


when
 the
 they're
 in
 the
 younger
 age


category.
 So
 teens
 below
 the
 age
 of
 16


cannot
 change
 the
 settings
 we
 set
 in


teen
 accounts
 um
 without
 getting
 a


parents
 permission.
 We're
 going
 a
 step


further
 with
 these
 content
 setting


changes
 which
 is
 it's
 for
 every
 teen


under
 the
 age
 of
 18
 but
 they
 can't


change
 them
 unless
 they
 get
 a
 parent
 to


approve
 it
 as
 well.


Tara
 Hopkins,
 global
 director
 for
 policy


for
 Instagram.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


joining
 us
 here
 on
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
 Okay,


coming
 up,
 Europe
 races
 to
 prove
 Jensen


One
 wrong
 about
 their
 AI
 capabilities.


That
 Bloomberg
 deep
 dive
 next.
 This
 is


Bloomberg
 Tech.


[Music]


Time
 now
 for
 talking
 tech
 and
 first
 up,


SpaceX.
 Well,
 it's
 pulled
 off
 another


successful
 launch
 and
 return
 of
 its


Starship
 rocket,
 which
 deployed
 test


satellite
 into
 orbit.
 Elon
 Musk's
 space


company
 still
 has
 to
 demonstrate
 and


master
 several
 novel
 technologies
 to


meet
 inc's
 goal
 of
 a
 lunar
 landing
 in


the
 next
 2
 years.
 Plus,
 Apple,
 well,
 it


set
 a
 release
 date
 for
 the
 launch
 of
 its


super
 thin
 iPhone
 air
 in
 China.
 The


phone
 will
 be
 available
 in
 stores
 later


this
 month
 after
 a
 pause
 that
 allow


local
 carriers
 to
 prepare
 for
 the


device,
 which
 is
 eim
 only.
 The
 news


coincided
 with
 a
 visit
 to
 the
 country
 by


Apple
 CEO
 Tim
 Cook.
 And
 Google
 is


planning
 its
 biggest
 investment
 in
 India


yet,
 about
 $15
 billion
 to
 build
 an
 AI


infrastructure
 hub
 in
 the
 south
 over
 the


next
 5
 years.
 India
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 winners
 of
 the
 global
 AI
 boom,


and
 the
 project
 will
 help
 accelerate


local
 government
 efforts
 to
 expand
 the


AI
 industry.
 Ed


>> Nvidia's
 Jensen
 Wong
 issued
 an
 AI


warning
 to
 Europe
 and
 France
 over
 the


summer.
 You
 are
 too
 slow.
 Now,
 European


leaders
 are
 working
 to
 prove
 him
 wrong


with
 many
 committing
 billions
 to


homegrown
 AI
 startups
 and
 services.


Bloomberg's
 European
 tech
 reporter
 Mark


Bergen
 has
 been
 writing
 about
 Europe's


attempts
 at
 catching
 up
 and
 joins
 us


now.
 Jensen
 Wong
 says,
 "You
 are
 too
 slow


at
 sort
 of
 an
 EUwide
 level
 or
 country
 by


country
 level.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 they're


actually
 doing
 to
 prove
 him
 wrong
 or
 at


least
 catch
 up?"


Yeah,
 that
 anecdote
 from
 our
 story
 was


like
 the
 lead
 of
 it
 was
 a
 dinner
 hosted


by
 Emanuel
 Mcronone
 and
 in
 a
 way
 before


his
 government
 collapsed.
 Uh
 they
 France


was
 seen
 as
 the
 vanguard
 here.
 They
 had


that
 um
 this
 early
 this
 year
 they


announced
 the
 largest
 data
 center


project
 in
 the
 EU.
 They
 have
 Mestral


which
 is
 the
 closest
 thing
 that
 Europe


has
 to
 sort
 of
 an
 open
 AI
 rival.
 Uh
 and


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 public
 support
 from


the
 government.
 The
 European
 Commission


and
 European
 Union
 has
 put
 money
 uh


behind
 chips
 behind
 what
 they
 call
 these


AI
 gigafactories
 basically
 large
 data


center
 projects.
 If
 you
 compare
 the


funding
 though
 to
 the
 US
 and
 China


though
 obviously
 Europe
 is
 still
 a


lagging
 third
 place.


>> When
 we
 think
 about
 the
 key
 players
 of


Europe
 they
 do
 have
 some
 standouts.
 ASML


when
 you
 think
 chip
 equipment
 making,


you've
 got
 SAP
 bringing
 it
 to
 the


enterprise.
 But
 where
 else
 are
 they


trying
 to
 grow
 their
 own
 talent
 and


indeed
 risk
 pushing
 back
 though
 the
 US


influx
 of
 money
 that
 seemed
 to
 come
 with


Jensen's
 last
 visit?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 couple
 things


happening
 and
 we
 cried
 to
 capture
 this


in
 the
 debate.
 There
 are,
 you
 know,


Jensen
 has
 been
 kind
 of
 teased
 Europe


for
 moving
 too
 slowly.
 Clearly,
 he
 wants


them
 to
 be
 buying
 more
 Nvidia
 chips.
 Um,


and
 there
 are
 others
 that
 are
 argue
 that


maybe
 this
 this
 this
 sovereignty,
 this


idea
 of
 dep
 independence
 from
 the
 US
 and


China
 means
 not
 relying
 on
 Nvidia,
 not


relying
 on
 OpenAI,
 not
 relying
 on


Microsoft
 and
 the
 cloud
 providers.


That's
 a
 lot
 more
 difficult.
 I
 think
 the


cloud
 is
 where
 we're
 starting
 to
 see


some
 really
 interesting
 of
 Neoclouds.


Nebus
 is
 a
 Dutch
 company
 here
 that
 spun


out
 from
 Russia's
 Yandex
 that's
 had
 a


really
 fascinating
 growth
 trajectory.


We've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of these
 Neocloud


companies
 come
 up
 in
 Europe.
 Um,
 some
 of


them
 are
 really
 positioning
 themselves


as
 alternatives
 to
 the
 US
 providers.


>> Endscale
 being
 another
 key
 name
 we
 keep


hearing
 about.
 Mark
 Bergen.
 Great
 story.


And
 what
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 forget
 is


we're
 going
 to
 dive
 into
 all
 of
 these


topics,
 so
 much
 more
 next
 week
 during


Bloomberg
 Tech
 Summit.
 It's
 being
 hosted


in
 London.
 It's
 on
 October
 the
 21st.
 But


meanwhile,
 that
 does
 it
 for
 this
 edition


of
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
 Ed.
 a
 lot
 to
 digest


in
 terms
 of
 geopolitics
 and
 in
 terms
 of


valuations.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 still
 a
 little
 bit
 of


anxiety
 in
 technology
 markets.
 It's


largely
 focused
 to
 trade.
 Uh
 Salesforce


is
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day
 that
 Dreamforce


kicks
 off.
 How's
 that
 going
 to
 go
 down?


You
 can
 recap
 that
 on
 the
 podcast.
 You


know
 where
 to
 find
 it.
 It's
 online
 on


all
 those
 platforms.
 It's
 on
 the


Bloomberg
 platforms.
 Big
 week
 ahead.


This
 is
 Bloomberg
 Tech.
