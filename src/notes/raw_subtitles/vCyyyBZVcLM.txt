I
 will
 tell
 you
 what
 this
 video
 isn't.


It
 is
 not
 a
 critique
 of
 the
 US


administration.
 It
 is
 not
 an
 emotionally


charged
 reaction
 to
 the
 H1B
 headlines.


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 an
 unbiased
 take
 to
 the


best
 of
 my
 abilities.
 Not
 right-leaning,


not
 left-leaning.
 What
 happened
 to
 H1B


is
 a
 piece
 of
 recent
 news.
 It
 happened.


We
 got
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 I
 will
 start
 by


saying
 that
 the
 reaction
 to
 the
 recent


news
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 economic


reality
 and
 everything
 to
 do
 with


political
 tensions
 in
 the
 US.
 H1B


program
 has
 been
 abused
 and
 misused
 for


years.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 the
 tech


industry's
 labor
 model
 has
 already
 been


transformed.
 So,
 while
 the
 $100,000
 fee


feels
 like
 a
 shock,
 in
 reality,
 this


change
 lands
 quite
 well
 in
 a
 system
 that


has
 already
 moved
 on.
 Let's
 dive
 in.


Let's
 start
 with
 a
 quick
 summary
 of
 what


happened.
 Just
 in
 case
 you
 missed
 the


news,
 which
 I
 highly
 doubt,
 but
 still.


On
 September
 19th,
 2025,
 President
 Trump


signed
 an
 executive
 order
 that


introduced
 fundamental
 changes
 to
 the


35-year-old
 visa
 program
 named
 H1B.
 The


order
 imposed
 a
 $100,000
 fee
 for
 all
 new


H1B
 visa
 applications.
 The
 previous
 fees


that
 companies
 had
 to
 pay
 for
 every
 H-1B


applications
 were
 between5
 and
 $10,000.


The
 policy
 took
 effect
 at
 12:01
 a.m.


Eastern
 time
 on
 September
 21st,
 2025.
 It


sent
 shock
 waves
 through
 Silicon
 Valley


and
 caused
 immediate
 chaos
 among
 tech


companies
 and
 foreign
 workers.
 This


video
 is
 being
 filmed
 on
 September
 28th,


2025.
 And
 here
 is
 what
 is
 confirmed
 so


far.
 The
 change
 applies
 to
 all
 new


petitions
 filed
 after
 September
 21st,


2025
 for
 all
 workers
 outside
 of
 the


United
 States.
 This
 does
 not
 apply
 to


current
 H-1B
 holders
 in
 the
 United


States.
 If
 a
 company
 files
 an
 H-1B
 for


someone
 who
 is
 outside
 of
 the
 United


States,
 they
 must
 pay
 the
 fee,
 whether


it's
 a
 regular
 lottery
 H-1B
 or
 one
 for


universities
 or
 nonprofits.
 The


determining
 factor
 here
 is
 the
 location,


whether
 you're
 inside
 or
 outside
 the
 US.


It
 is
 a
 onetime
 fee,
 not
 a
 yearly


subscription.
 and
 it
 has
 an
 immediate


impact
 on
 upcoming
 H-1B
 lottery.
 The


next
 H-1B
 filing
 season
 for
 the
 2027


quota
 will
 be
 directly
 affected.
 Any
 H1B


petition
 filed
 in
 that
 lottery
 for
 an


individual
 outside
 of
 the
 US
 will


require
 a
 $100,000
 payment.
 Employers


planning
 for
 the
 lottery
 should
 budget


accordingly.


And
 now
 I
 would
 like
 to
 invite
 you
 to


study
 and
 critically
 analyze
 the
 data


associated
 with
 this
 change.
 I
 think
 the


fact
 that
 this
 became
 such
 a
 shock
 is
 a


sign
 of
 a
 monumental
 misunderstanding


about
 how
 the
 tech
 industry's
 labor


model
 has
 already
 changed.
 In
 my


personal
 opinion,
 this
 fee
 changes
 very


little
 in
 the
 current
 state
 of
 the
 tech


industry
 in
 the
 US.
 The
 tech
 industry


has
 already
 flipped
 upside
 down
 in
 the


recent
 years
 and
 there
 are
 multiple


macro
 events
 that
 affected
 it.
 And
 for


the
 record,
 AI
 is
 not
 even
 in
 the
 top


five
 of
 those
 events.
 But
 it's
 like


people
 haven't
 noticed
 or
 haven't


processed.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 break
 down


why
 it's
 actually
 not
 that
 shocking.
 I


haven't
 shared
 this
 before,
 but
 this


channel
 is
 basically
 my
 second
 full-time


job.
 This
 is
 my
 startup
 where
 the


product
 is
 this
 channel.
 And
 it
 comes


with
 all
 features
 of
 a
 startup.
 I
 have


to
 build
 a
 product.
 I
 have
 to
 show
 it
 to


you.
 And
 if
 the
 quality
 is
 solid
 and
 the


algorithmic
 stars
 align,
 the
 world
 gets


to
 see
 my
 creation.
 And
 while
 I'm
 at
 it,


we
 spend
 lots
 of
 time
 chasing
 updates,


rewriting
 our
 notes,
 sending
 rounds
 and


rounds
 of
 feedback,
 and
 keeping


everything
 organized.
 And
 all
 of
 this


happens
 after
 my
 day
 job.
 Am
 I
 exhausted


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day?
 Yes,
 I
 am
 very


much
 exhausted.
 So,
 we
 made
 our
 first


ops
 hire.
 Except
 it's
 not
 a
 real
 human.


It's
 an
 agent.
 Notion
 AI
 agent.


Internally,
 we
 call
 him
 Jerry.
 Jerry


doesn't
 just
 suggest,
 it
 actually
 does


tasks
 end
 to
 end.
 This
 is
 by
 far
 the


cheapest
 and
 the
 least
 problematic
 ops


hire
 I've
 ever
 had
 in
 my
 career
 as
 a


creator
 or
 a
 PM.
 Here's
 what
 it
 looks


like.
 I
 tell
 it
 to
 compile
 this
 week's


research,
 all
 the
 Slack
 updates
 that


Maria
 and
 I
 have
 been
 sharing,
 all
 of


the
 feedback
 that
 I
 owe
 you
 guys,
 all
 of


the
 emails
 I
 responded
 to
 into
 one


status
 report
 so
 that
 I
 know
 what's
 done


and
 what
 isn't.
 It
 searches
 and
 reads


our
 entire
 Notion
 database.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 all
 of
 our
 channel
 has
 run
 out
 of


Notion.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 it


completes
 tasks
 automatically.
 Unlike


LLM
 tools
 where
 you
 get
 back
 and
 forth


chat
 that
 doesn't
 connect
 to
 other


platforms,
 notion
 offers
 an
 agent
 that


organizes
 and
 simplifies
 your
 entire


life
 by
 connecting
 with
 multiple
 apps


that
 you
 work
 with.
 Slack,
 chat,
 GPT,


Cursor,
 Claude,
 Gmail,
 Drive,
 Teams.


Notion
 agent
 can
 perform
 a
 range
 of


tasks
 and
 it
 would
 do
 so
 faster
 than
 it


would
 take
 you
 to
 explain
 to
 a
 human


what
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 and
 how.
 It
 can
 be


your
 content
 critic.
 It
 can
 be
 your


personal
 assistant.
 It
 can
 help
 you
 get


unstuck
 with
 a
 writer's
 block.
 It
 can


help
 you
 run
 all
 sorts
 of
 projects
 from


a
 small
 team
 event
 to
 a
 complex


multi-step
 go-to
 market
 plan.
 It
 can


automatically
 combine
 an
 entire
 project


update
 by
 pulling
 information
 from
 your


databases,
 messengers,
 and
 your
 email.


Notion
 has
 been
 our
 go-to
 app
 for
 years,


way
 before
 we
 started
 this
 channel.
 But


with
 the
 recent
 launch
 of
 Notion
 AI


Agent,
 or
 Jerry,
 we
 became
 a
 team
 of


three.
 Like
 I
 said,
 I
 treat
 this
 channel


as
 my
 first
 startup
 and
 Notion
 Agent
 is


my
 personal
 assistant,
 my
 project


manager,
 and
 my
 operations
 wiz


allin-one,
 except
 that
 it
 costs
 less


than
 a
 single
 freelance
 hour,
 and
 it


never
 forgets
 and
 never
 gets
 tired.
 Try


it
 for
 yourself
 and
 let
 notion
 agent
 do


the
 work
 for
 you.
 Huge
 thanks
 to
 Notion


for
 sponsoring
 this
 part
 of
 the
 video.


We
 absolutely
 love
 your
 product.
 Over


the
 past
 3
 years,
 there
 has
 been
 a
 50%


decline
 in
 the
 registrations
 received


for
 H1B.
 When
 I
 say
 3
 years,
 I'm


referring
 to
 year
 2024
 to
 2026
 because


the
 registrations
 for
 2026
 have
 already


been
 submitted
 and
 this
 was
 done
 way


before
 this
 change
 came
 into
 effect
 in


March
 2025.
 So
 this
 50%
 decline
 is


entirely
 due
 to
 pre-existing
 factors.
 As


you
 can
 see,
 in
 fiscal
 year
 2024,


780,000
 registrations
 were
 received.
 In


2025,
 almost
 480
 and
 in
 fiscal
 year


2026,


344.


This
 decline
 is
 a
 result
 of
 a
 perfect


storm
 of
 policy
 changes,
 fraud


crackdowns,
 economic
 factors,
 and


systematic
 reforms
 around
 H-1B.
 Let's


break
 it
 down.
 Why
 did
 this
 happen?


Reason
 number
 one,
 the
 epidemic
 of


fraudulent
 multiple
 registrations


between
 year
 2020
 and
 2024.
 In
 July


2024,
 the
 Bloomberg
 published
 an


earthshaking
 investigation
 that
 revealed


systematic
 abuse
 and
 numerous
 frauds


that
 have
 reached
 epidemic
 proportions.


In
 H1B
 registration
 data
 submitted
 in


fiscal
 year
 2023,
 there
 was
 one


individual
 that
 was
 registered
 83
 times.


Also,
 in
 2023,
 over
 9,000
 individuals


had
 five
 or
 more
 registrations.


Bloomberg
 analysis
 estimates
 that


roughly
 15,500
 of
 allocated
 visas,


meaning
 one
 in
 six
 were
 obtained
 through


lottery
 gaming.
 In
 this
 case,
 lottery


gaming
 is
 when
 you
 submit
 multiple


registrations
 for
 one
 person.
 Now,
 there


is
 something
 you
 need
 to
 know
 about


Indian
 agencies
 that
 supplied
 workers
 to


the
 United
 States.
 But
 just
 in
 case


you're
 unfamiliar
 with
 the
 significance


of
 Indian
 firms
 in
 the
 context
 of
 H-1B,


here
 is
 why
 it's
 important.
 Here
 is
 the


demographics
 of
 people
 who
 obtained
 H-1B


visas.
 Indian
 nationals
 hold
 around
 71%


of
 all
 H-1B
 visas.
 The
 second
 largest


group
 is
 Chinese
 nationals.
 But
 even


between
 these
 two
 largest
 groups,
 you


can
 tell
 how
 big
 the
 difference
 is.
 The


third
 largest
 is
 Canadian
 nationals.
 But


Canadian
 nationals
 have
 another
 path


into
 the
 US,
 which
 is
 the
 TN
 visa.
 So,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 subject
 of


this
 conversation.
 Now,
 let's
 look
 at


the
 H-1B
 usage
 pattern
 by
 American
 tech


enterprises.
 The
 companies
 that
 benefit


the
 most
 from
 H-1B
 visa
 holders
 are
 big


tech
 and
 other
 tier
 1
 American


enterprises
 and
 consulting
 firms.
 Now


for
 the
 Indian
 nationals
 and
 remember


that
 is
 71%
 of
 all
 H-1B
 visas.
 25%
 of


them
 are
 sponsored
 by
 major
 Indian
 IT


service
 companies.
 Here's
 how
 it
 works.


For
 example,
 Indian
 IT
 firms
 like
 these


hire
 skilled
 engineers
 and
 tech


professionals
 within
 India.
 Then
 these


companies
 act
 as
 H-1B
 visa
 sponsors,


meaning
 that
 they
 file
 visa
 petitions
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 workers
 that
 they
 employ.


They
 negotiate
 the
 contract.
 They


negotiate
 the
 salary
 in
 the
 US
 and
 they


supply
 the
 talent
 to
 the
 US
 company.
 The


contract
 negotiation
 happens
 between
 an


Indian
 consultancy
 and
 the
 US
 company


that
 hires
 the
 talent,
 not
 between
 the


individual
 who
 gets
 the
 job.
 Now
 the


remainder
 of
 H-1B
 visas
 are
 sponsored


either
 by
 American
 companies
 directly
 or


perhaps
 universities,
 startups
 or
 other


employer
 types.
 But
 this
 25%
 figure


which
 is
 the
 number
 of
 people
 sponsored


by
 IT
 consultant
 firms
 is
 quite
 sizable


for
 H-1B
 because
 Indian
 IT
 firms
 are
 the


largest
 employer
 group
 category
 under


H1B.
 So
 going
 back
 to
 the
 problem
 of


multiple
 fraudulent
 registrations,
 what


Indian
 consulting
 firms
 that
 supplied


workers
 to
 the
 US
 would
 do
 is
 they
 would


create
 multiple
 companies
 with
 similar


names
 and
 shared
 addresses.
 They
 would


submit
 the
 same
 worker
 multiple
 times


under
 different
 company
 names
 and
 that


would
 significantly
 increase
 their


chances
 at
 lottery
 wins.
 While


legitimate
 companies
 get
 fewer
 than
 half


of
 their
 requested
 visas,
 they
 would


then
 rent
 out
 H-1B
 workers
 to
 major
 US


giants
 like
 Amazon
 or
 Google
 and
 take
 20


to
 30%
 of
 their
 pay.
 Bloomberg
 also


found
 out
 that
 the
 HCL
 Technologies,


which
 is
 an
 Indian
 IT
 consulting


company,
 allegedly
 underpaid
 H-1B


workers
 by
 $95
 million.
 Before
 filming


this
 video,
 I
 posted
 a
 community
 post
 on


YouTube
 asking
 you
 guys
 to
 drop
 your


questions.
 So,
 I
 will
 be
 responding
 to


most
 of
 them
 as
 we
 go
 through
 the
 video.


Here
 is
 one
 of
 them.
 Indian
 workers
 were


given
 carrots
 for
 working
 on
 shore.
 Now,


based
 on
 everything
 I
 just
 said,
 to
 be


objective,
 it
 is
 important
 to
 understand


why
 they
 were
 paid
 carrots.
 Both
 US


companies
 and
 Indian
 consultant


companies
 benefited
 from
 this.
 America


hired
 workers
 with
 the
 necessary


qualifications
 for
 less
 and
 Indian


agencies
 rented
 out
 their
 own
 people
 for


less.
 Now
 the
 tech
 workers
 who
 wanted
 a


chance
 at
 an
 immigration
 took
 those


offers
 which
 were
 carrots
 and
 went.
 So


it's
 a
 win-win
 for
 the
 companies
 but
 the


worker
 is
 the
 one
 who
 gets
 screwed.


Reason
 number
 two,
 in
 response
 to
 these


frauds,
 in
 2025,
 the
 US
 citizenship
 and


immigration
 services
 introduced
 the


beneficiary
 centric
 selection
 reform
 to


fight
 the
 fraud.
 The
 reform
 introduced


the
 following
 changes.
 Each
 unique


person
 gets
 selected
 only
 once


regardless
 of
 how
 many
 employers


register
 them,
 which
 basically
 means


that
 the
 incentive
 for
 multiple


registrations
 was
 eliminated.
 As
 a


result,
 right
 after
 this
 reform,
 there


was
 a
 38.6%
 6%
 decline
 in
 registration


in
 the
 following
 year.
 Reason
 number


three,
 tech
 industry
 layoffs
 and
 reduced


demand.
 In
 the
 past
 3
 years,
 the
 tech


industry
 went
 through
 unprecedented
 job


cuts
 as
 a
 result
 of
 extreme
 overhiring


during
 pandemic.
 I
 dedicated
 several


videos
 to
 this
 topic,
 explaining
 why
 the


layoff
 crisis
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 AI


and
 everything
 to
 do
 with
 overhiring


correction.
 So,
 if
 you'd
 like
 to


understand
 the
 reasons
 why,
 check
 these


out.
 But
 because
 of
 those
 layoffs,
 H-1B


holders
 got
 particularly
 affected.
 The


ones
 who
 got
 laid
 off
 face
 60-day


deadlines
 to
 find
 new
 sponsors
 or
 leave


the
 country.
 Companies
 became
 reluctant


to
 sponsor
 new
 H1B
 workers
 while
 laying


off
 existing
 staff.
 And
 to
 top
 it
 off,


Microsoft
 got
 caught
 in
 a
 wave
 of


backlash
 and
 criticism
 because
 they


requested
 4700
 H1B
 visas
 while
 laying


off
 9,000
 employees.
 Reason
 number
 four,


remote
 work
 and
 outsourcing.
 The
 decline


in
 relocating
 workers
 to
 the
 US
 was


already
 happening
 since
 before
 the


pandemic
 when
 companies
 realized
 that
 a


lot
 of
 work
 and
 especially
 technical


work
 could
 be
 done
 remotely.
 Pandemic


did
 not
 cause
 it
 but
 it
 significantly


accelerated
 the
 shift.
 The
 pandemic


provided
 the
 proof
 of
 concept
 if
 I
 may


that
 skeptics
 needed
 because
 today
 three


to
 four
 times
 more
 tech
 workers
 are


remote
 compared
 to
 2019.
 A
 quick
 example


from
 my
 personal
 experience,
 product
 and


product
 management
 has
 been
 historically


one
 of
 the
 safest
 jobs
 of
 all
 when
 it


came
 to
 offshoring
 because
 PMs
 are


almost
 always
 on
 site.
 When
 I
 say


on-site,
 I
 don't
 necessarily
 mean
 that


they're
 in
 the
 office,
 but
 they're


usually
 in
 the
 country
 where
 the
 product


is
 being
 sold.
 But
 even
 for
 product
 and


I'm
 seeing
 this
 in
 my
 career
 like
 over


the
 past
 5
 years
 for
 example
 I
 have
 seen


both
 my
 colleagues
 and
 myself
 being


replaced
 by
 offshore
 talent
 after
 we


left.
 The
 tech
 industry
 has
 already


shifted
 away
 from
 visa
 dependent
 hiring


several
 years
 ago.
 There
 is
 sufficient


data
 that
 confirms
 that
 this


transformation
 was
 accelerating


regardless
 of
 immigration
 policy.
 Remote


work
 became
 the
 norm,
 not
 the
 exception.


97%
 of
 tech
 companies
 today
 offer
 either


remote
 or
 hybrid
 options.
 Global
 IT


outsourcing
 market
 is
 731
 billion
 in


2025.
 74%
 of
 all
 global
 outsourcing
 is


now
 IT
 services.
 The
 top
 seven
 Indian


firms
 that
 provided
 talent
 to
 the
 US


companies
 reduced
 H-1B
 usage
 by
 56%
 over


the
 past
 eight
 years
 because
 the
 western


market
 had
 already
 begun
 switching
 to


the
 outsourcing
 model
 instead
 of
 H-1B


hiring.
 They
 did
 it
 gradually
 but


they've
 been
 doing
 it
 for
 a
 while.
 In


2025,
 for
 the
 top
 10
 Indian
 consulting


companies
 that
 provide
 IT
 services,
 H-1B


workers
 represent
 less
 than
 1%
 of
 their


entire
 employee
 base.
 And
 for
 the
 US


enterprises,
 Amazon
 alone
 has
 1.5


million
 employees
 globally.
 Their
 12,000


people
 on
 H-1B
 represent
 less
 than
 1%
 of


the
 entire
 workforce.
 Even
 before


Trump's
 fee,
 the
 economics
 were
 shifting


against
 H-1B
 as
 a
 whole.
 And
 here's
 why.


A
 typical
 H-1B
 tech
 worker
 at
 an
 Indian


firm
 earns
 around
 $15,000
 annually
 while


generating
 between
 150
 and
 $200,000
 in


billings.
 This
 produces
 only
 $15
 to


$20,000
 a
 year
 in
 annual
 profit
 and


that's
 a
 10%
 margins.
 The
 previous
 H1B


fees
 between
 $5
 to
 $10,000
 were
 already


eating
 into
 those
 margins,
 let
 alone


100K.
 Now,
 let's
 quickly
 come
 back
 to


your
 comments.
 Here's
 one
 of
 them.


hiring
 talent
 overseas
 and
 increasing
 US


jobs
 are
 two
 unrelated
 events
 because


there
 is
 nothing
 that
 prevents
 the
 US


from
 doing
 it
 now.
 It's
 the
 remote


hiring
 that
 affected
 the
 decline
 of


H-1B,
 not
 the
 other
 way
 around.
 And


another
 good
 comment
 about
 subsidiaries.


They
 do
 open
 them
 and
 they
 do
 funnel


work
 through
 them.
 As
 you
 know,
 all
 big


tech
 and
 tier
 1
 enterprises
 have
 been


opening
 and
 shifting
 multiple
 resources


to
 other
 countries.
 Just
 a
 few
 examples,


Canada,
 Ireland,
 England,
 and
 Germany.


There
 really
 is
 no
 reason
 for
 a
 worker


to
 be
 physically
 present
 in
 the
 US,


especially
 if
 all
 of
 the
 teams
 that


they're
 working
 with
 are
 offshore.
 All


of
 this
 brings
 me
 to
 my
 final
 point.


Current
 rates
 for
 offshore
 technical


work
 make
 the
 $100,000
 fee
 almost


irrelevant
 from
 the
 economic
 standpoint


for
 the
 US.
 In
 India,
 the
 rate
 is


between
 $18
 and
 $40
 per
 hour
 for
 full


stack
 developers.
 In
 Eastern
 Europe,


between
 25
 and
 149
 per
 hour.
 In
 Latin


America,
 the
 rates
 are
 not
 only


competitive,
 but
 also
 with
 US
 time
 zone


alignment.
 A
 company
 paying
 an
 offshore


developer
 $50
 an
 hour,
 which
 is
 $100,000


total,
 can
 avoid
 both
 the
 H-1B
 fee
 and


the
 higher
 US
 salary
 while
 getting
 the


same
 work
 done.
 Now,
 to
 that
 you
 may


say,
 what
 about
 all
 the
 people
 who


considered
 H-1B
 a
 path
 to
 immigration?


And
 to
 answer
 that
 question,
 I
 would


like
 to
 pause
 and
 bring
 you
 back
 to
 the


initial
 purpose
 of
 the
 H-1B
 program.
 The


whole
 point
 of
 H1B
 from
 its
 inception


was
 that
 it
 was
 always
 meant
 to
 be
 for


highly
 experienced
 and
 distinguished


individuals.
 H1
 visa
 category
 was


created
 by
 the
 immigration
 and


nationality
 act
 for
 foreign
 workers
 and


distinguished
 merit
 and
 ability
 in
 the


50s.
 In
 the
 '90s,
 President
 Bush


introduced
 a
 subgroup
 in
 the
 H1
 visa


category
 called
 H1B
 and
 it
 was
 created


for
 workers
 with
 specialty
 occupations


and
 distinguished
 ability.
 I
 would
 like


to
 thank
 the
 author
 of
 this
 comment
 for


suggesting
 the
 report
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


reference
 in
 this
 section.
 There
 are


four
 levels
 of
 job
 complexity
 and
 each


level
 is
 defined
 by
 the
 value
 that
 this


job
 is
 going
 to
 bring
 to
 the
 enterprise


and
 the
 value
 is
 defined
 by
 the
 proposed


salary.
 As
 you
 can
 see,
 the
 minority
 of


registrations
 were
 filed
 at
 level
 four


while
 nearly
 half
 were
 filed
 at
 level


two.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 15.4%
 4%
 of
 all


applications
 were
 filed
 at
 level
 one,


the
 lowest
 possible
 wage
 tier.
 From


these
 two
 charts
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the


report,
 it
 becomes
 pretty
 evident
 that


the
 H-1B
 program
 was
 not
 used
 to
 attract


top
 tier
 global
 talent
 as
 it
 originally


intended,
 but
 to
 fill
 the
 roles
 at
 below


median
 wage
 levels,
 which
 goes
 against


its
 stated
 objectives.
 On
 this
 chart,


you
 can
 see
 that
 the
 H-1B
 wage


distributions
 are
 systematically
 lower


at
 every
 percentile
 point,
 which
 may


suggest
 that
 the
 employer
 practices
 in


H1B
 sponsorships
 do
 not
 go
 in
 line
 with


the
 objective
 of
 the
 program.
 The


majority
 of
 H-1B
 positions
 fell
 into
 the


lower
 wage
 levels
 one
 and
 two,
 which


creates
 economic
 advantage
 for
 US


companies
 to
 favor
 H-1B
 workers
 over


similarly
 skilled
 US
 workers.
 But
 this


is
 not
 what
 the
 program
 was
 built
 for.


H-1B
 program
 was
 created
 by
 the
 US
 to


support
 the
 interests
 of
 the
 US
 in


finding
 highly
 skilled
 talent
 to
 fill


talent
 shortages.
 This
 was
 meant
 to
 be


the
 path
 only
 for
 highly
 experienced


people.
 The
 reason
 this
 program
 has


collapsed,
 well,
 not
 fully,
 but
 you
 know


what
 I
 mean,
 is
 because
 it
 was
 abused
 by


both
 US
 enterprises
 as
 well
 as
 foreign


agencies
 in
 the
 countries
 that
 supplied


H-1B
 talent.
 Okay,
 now
 that
 we've


covered
 H-1B
 and
 macro
 changes
 in
 the


tech
 industry,
 let's
 understand
 what


this
 really
 means.
 If
 you
 study
 the


boring
 data
 around
 H1B
 fee
 controversy,


you
 will
 understand
 that
 the
 decline
 of


H-1B
 was
 inevitable.
 The
 global
 tech


industry
 has
 fundamentally
 changed
 its


operating
 model
 and
 physical
 location


matters
 far
 less
 than
 it
 did
 even
 5


years
 ago.
 This
 fee
 makes
 H-1B
 a
 less


desired
 path
 for
 immigration.
 As
 in,
 of


all
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 can
 pick
 to
 move


to
 the
 US
 as
 a
 tech
 worker,
 H1B
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 lot
 less
 popular.
 But
 it
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 a
 problem
 from
 the
 economic


standpoint
 for
 the
 US.
 The
 transition


was
 already
 happening
 and
 H1B
 dependency


was
 declining.
 Remote
 work
 provided
 more


economically
 viable
 way
 to
 hire
 talent


rather
 than
 bringing
 workers
 in
 the
 US.


Global
 talent
 access
 and
 the
 quality
 of


global
 talent
 improved
 through
 direct


outsourcing.
 And
 lastly,
 cost
 savings


for
 the
 US
 were
 dramatic
 even
 before
 the


fee.
 The
 surprise
 reaction
 shows
 how


political
 noise
 contradicts
 economic


realities.
 Quickly
 coming
 back
 to
 the


comments
 now
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 students.


Yes,
 it
 is
 absolutely
 true
 that
 the


students
 depending
 on
 the
 H-1B
 visas


after
 graduation
 are
 among
 the
 most


affected
 groups.
 Many
 international


students
 rely
 on
 the
 H-1B
 pathway
 to


transition
 from
 the
 F1
 student
 visa
 and


the
 data
 confirms
 that
 a
 significant


chunk
 of
 H1B
 visa
 holders
 were


previously
 on
 F1.
 On
 the
 positive
 side,


I
 am
 pretty
 sure
 that
 the
 US
 government


will
 make
 certain
 exceptions
 or
 special


programs
 for
 academic
 jobs
 or
 people
 who


graduated
 masters
 or
 PhD
 level
 programs


in
 the
 upcoming
 months.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 I
 got
 to
 admit
 that
 of
 all
 the


people
 who
 got
 affected
 by
 the
 H-1B


changes,
 students
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 are


going
 to
 have
 a
 very
 hard
 time
 staying


in
 the
 US.
 Now
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 if
 you


have
 graduated
 from
 an
 American


university,
 especially
 if
 it's
 a


university
 with
 a
 big
 name,
 Canada,


Europe,
 and
 Asia
 will
 gladly
 take
 you.


But
 yeah,
 if
 we
 talk
 about
 the


possibility
 of
 staying
 in
 the
 US
 long


term,
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 much
 harder.


This
 comment
 here
 that
 this
 move
 is


against
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 US
 to


attract
 the
 best
 minds.
 This
 is
 probably


the
 only
 point
 that
 I
 personally


disagree
 with
 only
 because
 there
 are


multiple
 other
 ways
 to
 attract
 the
 best


talent.
 There
 is
 L1,
 there
 is
 01,
 there


is
 TN,
 there
 is
 satellite
 office
 hiring.


There
 are
 multiple
 ways
 of
 bringing


people
 into
 the
 US
 or
 having
 them
 do
 the


work
 for
 the
 US
 companies
 outside
 of


H1B.
 Now
 there
 is
 this
 famous
 saying


that
 there
 is
 no
 Silicon
 Valley
 without


H-1B
 which
 is
 true
 because
 the
 impact


and
 the
 amount
 of
 innovation
 and
 talent


that
 other
 countries
 have
 given
 the
 US


cannot
 be
 underestimated.
 But
 when
 it


comes
 to
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 H1B
 in
 my


view
 H1B
 is
 being
 used
 here
 fairly


loosely.
 H1B
 in
 this
 case
 is
 like
 an


umbrella
 term
 for
 all
 immigrants
 who


came
 to
 the
 US
 who
 brought
 their
 talent


to
 the
 US
 to
 build
 something
 that
 they


weren't
 able
 to
 build
 back
 home.
 So
 it's


not
 so
 much
 about
 H1B
 in
 particular.


It's
 also
 01
 and
 L1
 and
 TN
 and
 all
 other


kinds
 of
 visas
 that
 exist
 out
 there
 that


would
 allow
 you
 to
 get
 into
 the
 US
 as
 a


tech
 worker.
 And
 lastly,
 let's
 talk


about
 what
 this
 means
 for
 global
 tech


diversification,
 specifically
 in
 Canada,


Europe,
 and
 Asia.


Starting
 with
 Canada,
 Canada
 already


operates
 a
 dedicated
 program
 allowing
 up


to
 10,000
 H1B
 visa
 holders
 to
 apply
 for


Canadian
 work
 permits
 annually.
 Canadian


work
 permits
 can
 be
 processed
 in
 as


little
 as
 2
 weeks
 through
 the
 global


talent
 stream.
 Unlike
 the
 US,
 spouses
 of


foreign
 workers
 automatically
 receive


work
 permits
 in
 Canada.
 There's
 been
 a


lot
 of
 questions
 asking
 whether
 people


are
 going
 to
 pick
 Canada
 over
 the
 US.


Yes,
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 interest,
 but


let's
 talk
 about
 it
 in
 detail
 because


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 straightforward.


The
 changes
 to
 H-1B
 do
 open
 a
 window
 for


Canada
 to
 attract
 STEM
 talent
 with
 work


experience
 from
 the
 US
 and
 support


population
 growth
 and
 economy
 for
 lots


of
 tech
 workers
 in
 North
 America
 and


this
 includes
 Canadian
 born,


Americanborn
 and
 foreignb
 born
 people.


Canada
 has
 a
 reputation
 of
 being
 an


option
 B
 if
 America
 doesn't
 work
 out.


Having
 lived
 in
 Canada
 for
 many
 years,


of
 all
 my
 network
 in
 tech,
 the
 people


who
 would
 typically
 pick
 Canada
 over
 the


US
 would
 be
 the
 ones
 with
 very
 strong


political
 or
 ideological
 views.
 For


example,
 it's
 very
 common
 to
 hear
 from


people
 who
 have
 kids
 to
 hear
 that
 they


would
 be
 scared
 of
 gun
 violence
 in
 the


US
 and
 that's
 why
 they
 prefer
 Canada.


But
 people
 who
 don't
 have
 very
 strong


views
 would
 happily
 go
 to
 the
 US.
 It
 can


be
 either
 in
 a
 form
 of
 complete


relocation.
 It
 could
 be
 that
 they're


still
 located
 in
 Canada
 but
 working
 for


the
 US
 enterprise
 and
 going
 back
 and


forth.
 It
 could
 be
 that
 they're


completely
 remote
 but
 working
 for
 a
 US


salary.
 Point
 is
 the
 US
 salary
 is
 a


dream
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 Canada.
 But


since
 we're
 talking
 about
 countries
 and


the
 fact
 that
 H-1B
 is
 no
 longer
 working


in
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 US,
 it
 is
 only


fair
 to
 think
 about
 the
 same
 problem


from
 the
 interest
 of
 Canada.
 when
 a


Canadian
 builds
 a
 software,
 a
 product,


anything
 really
 that
 is
 tied
 to
 a


foreign
 intellectual
 property.
 So
 in


other
 words,
 if
 a
 person
 in
 Canada
 is


working
 for
 a
 US
 company
 or
 reports
 to


head
 offices
 outside
 of
 Canada,
 the


intellectual
 property
 stays
 outside
 of


Canada
 and
 does
 not
 contribute
 to
 the


country's
 long-term
 innovation
 strategy.


I
 spoke
 about
 intellectual
 property


crisis
 in
 Canada
 in
 this
 video
 at


length.
 Check
 it
 out
 if
 you're


interested.
 And
 this
 doesn't
 solely


apply
 to
 Canada.
 It's
 just
 in
 Canada,
 we


have
 a
 pretty
 big
 crisis
 with
 that.
 But


the
 point
 I'm
 trying
 to
 make
 is
 that
 if


Canada
 wants
 to
 use
 the
 opportunity
 to


attract
 STEM
 talent
 that
 cannot
 stay
 in


the
 US,
 we
 cannot
 solve
 this
 problem
 by


simply
 opening
 an
 equivalent
 of
 H-1B
 and


being
 like,
 "Yep,
 come
 in
 and
 work
 for


the
 US
 enterprises."
 We
 have
 to
 offer
 a


better
 alternative
 for
 the
 people
 who


come
 here
 to
 have
 reasons
 to
 stay
 even


if
 this
 shift
 with
 H-1B
 gets
 reverted
 5


years
 down
 the
 line
 by
 the
 next
 US


government.
 On
 top
 of
 it,
 the


infrastructure
 reality
 check.
 Canada
 has


introduced
 significant
 constraints
 to


the
 immigration
 system.
 Starting
 2025,


Canada
 reduced
 annual
 immigration
 levels


by
 20%.
 Bottom
 line,
 if
 Canada
 wants
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 the
 changes
 caused
 by


H-1B,
 instead
 of
 being
 an
 American


satellite
 or
 a
 constant
 option
 B
 if


America
 doesn't
 work
 out,
 there
 needs
 to


be
 a
 thoughtful
 and
 comprehensive


program
 designed
 to
 benefit
 Canada


before
 everybody
 else.
 a
 program
 that


will
 protect
 Canadian
 intellectual


property,
 get
 VC
 money
 to
 Canada,
 and


have
 people
 stay
 here
 even
 if
 something


changes
 in
 the
 US.
 For
 now,
 the
 Canadian


government
 has
 been
 silent,
 but
 then


it's
 only
 been
 a
 week.
 We'll
 see
 what


happens
 next.
 A
 few
 words
 on
 Europe.
 For


years,
 probably
 decades,
 to
 anyone


working
 in
 big
 tech
 or
 tier
 one
 tech
 in


the
 US
 or
 even
 Canada,
 Europe
 was
 never


really
 considered
 an
 option.
 maybe


London,
 perhaps
 Dublin
 only
 for
 fang,


but
 Europe
 has
 always
 been
 considered


like
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 step
 back
 after
 the
 US


or
 Canada.
 However,
 with
 the
 recent


geopolitical
 shifts
 of
 the
 past
 5
 years


and
 the
 post-pandemic
 post
 layoff
 AI


first
 economy,
 the
 UK
 is
 surprisingly


emerging
 as
 a
 major
 beneficiary
 despite


Brexit
 related
 talent
 outflows.
 Germany


is
 also
 positioning
 itself
 as
 the


primary
 H-1B
 alternative
 in
 Europe


through
 multiple
 visa
 programs.
 In
 this


specific
 video,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 drill


into
 the
 whole
 tech
 situation
 in
 Europe


because
 I
 made
 a
 series
 of
 videos


analyzing
 various
 tech
 markets
 in


post-pandemic
 post
 layoff
 AI
 first


economy
 and
 covered
 multiple
 markets
 in


Europe
 and
 the
 Gulf
 region.
 You're


welcome
 to
 explore
 those.
 Long
 story


short,
 we
 are
 indeed
 at
 a
 point
 where


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 stronger


diversification
 of
 tech
 hubs
 across


Canada,
 Europe,
 and
 Asia.
 Before
 we
 wrap


up,
 a
 few
 more
 questions
 that
 you
 guys


dropped.
 Is
 this
 change
 reversible?


Personally,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I
 don't


think
 it
 will
 be
 fully
 reversed.
 It
 is


very
 possible
 that
 it
 will
 be
 corrected


or
 some
 new
 clauses
 introduced
 or


perhaps
 some
 new
 programs
 for
 students


who
 graduate
 universities
 this
 year
 or


next
 year.
 But
 given
 the
 patterns
 of
 the


current
 US
 administration
 and
 the
 fact


that
 H-1B
 program
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 was


extremely
 flawed,
 I
 do
 not
 think
 that
 it


will
 be
 reversed.
 And
 if
 anything,
 if


they
 decide
 to
 change
 it,
 I
 think
 that


they
 should
 introduce
 a
 different


program
 altogether.
 But
 again,
 this
 is


just
 my
 opinion.
 Will
 this
 erode
 US's


technology
 advantage?
 I
 personally
 would


say
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 it
 is
 a


guaranteed
 erosion.
 I
 mean
 despite
 what


happened,
 the
 US
 has
 very
 strong


systematic
 advantages.
 It
 has


universities.
 It
 has
 unmatched
 VC
 scene,


capital,
 infrastructure,
 large
 tech


firms
 and
 that
 culture,
 that
 real
 tech


culture.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 that
 the
 US
 will


lose
 its
 advantage
 on
 the
 global
 scale.


But
 instead,
 again,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 I


think
 that
 what
 has
 happened
 to
 H1B
 is
 a


signal
 of
 global
 diversification
 and
 the


fact
 that
 US
 is
 no
 longer
 the
 only
 place


to
 be
 if
 you're
 in
 big
 tech
 and
 want
 to


make
 really
 good
 money.
 Given
 how
 flawed


H1B
 was,
 it
 is
 very
 possible
 that
 an


alternative
 program
 will
 be
 introduced.


And
 also,
 let's
 not
 forget
 about
 L1,
 01,


and
 TN.
 Also,
 lots
 of
 tech
 companies
 are


shifting
 work
 to
 satellite
 offices
 or


outsourcing
 globally.
 So
 again
 to
 me


personally
 this
 does
 not
 sound
 like
 an


erosion
 but
 rather
 a
 sign
 of
 global


diversifications
 which
 is
 actually


happening
 not
 only
 on
 the
 tech
 level
 but


on
 the
 global
 geopolitical
 level
 where


US
 is
 no
 longer
 the
 biggest
 superpower.


And
 that's
 a
 wrap
 for
 today's
 episode.
 I


covered
 as
 much
 as
 I
 could
 without


deviating
 from
 the
 subject.
 So
 for
 any


questions
 that
 I
 haven't
 covered
 I
 will


either
 take
 them
 up
 in
 future
 videos
 or


respond
 in
 comments.
 As
 always
 would


love
 to
 hear
 what
 you
 guys
 think.
 Thank


you
 for
 listening.
 Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
