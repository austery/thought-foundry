 to
 Bloomberg
 Business


Week
 with
 Carol
 Masser
 and
 Tim
 Stenc
 on


Bloomberg
 Radio.


Hey,
 this
 week
 in
 our
 weekly
 Business


Week
 Women's
 Health
 segment,
 where
 we


focus
 on
 key
 issues
 in
 developing


technologies
 impacting
 the
 present
 and


future
 of
 women's
 health
 around
 the


world,
 we
 wanted
 to
 tackle
 the
 issue
 of


um
 kind
 of
 everybody's
 health
 when
 it


comes
 to
 a
 digital
 world.
 Tim.
 Yeah,


we've
 got
 with
 us
 the
 doctor
 and


psychologist
 Kenishha
 Sinclair
 McBride.


She's
 associate
 chief
 of
 integrated


behavioral
 health
 at
 Boston
 Children's


Hospital.
 She's
 also
 an
 assistant


professor
 of
 psychology
 at
 Harvard


Medical
 School.
 She
 also
 does
 work
 for


Boston's
 children
 Boston
 Children's


Hospital
 digital
 wellness
 lab.
 She
 joins


us
 from
 Boston.
 Doctor,
 welcome
 to
 the


program.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 understand
 when


you
 when
 you
 think
 about
 overall
 health


to
 to
 what
 extent
 is
 screen
 time
 a
 part


of
 that
 conversation?


Well,
 thank
 you
 guys
 so
 much
 for
 having


me.
 And
 health
 and
 screen
 time
 are


really
 connected.
 Well,
 we
 think
 about


mental
 health
 care
 and
 physical


healthcare
 as
 a
 whole
 child
 approach.


And
 so
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 social
 media
 and


screen
 time,
 we
 um
 are
 concerned
 about


the
 connections
 with
 mood,
 depression,


anxiety,
 body
 image,
 experiences
 of


bullying
 or
 harassment.
 And
 then
 on
 the


physical
 side
 of
 things,
 concerns
 about


sleep
 and
 impact
 on
 physical
 activity


and
 getting
 things
 done
 during
 your
 day.


So
 what's
 the
 right
 conversation
 to
 have


with
 parents?
 I
 think
 about
 this
 a
 lot


and
 I,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 kind
 of
 strict


with
 our
 daughter.
 She's
 22
 now,


but
 it
 was
 a
 different
 world
 then.


Yeah,
 it's
 amazing
 20
 right
 that
 many


years
 ago.
 But
 having
 said
 that,


increasingly
 as
 she
 got
 older,
 I
 mean


everything,
 even
 school
 work
 and


assignments
 and
 interaction
 with


teachers,
 it
 all
 happened
 digitally.
 And


so
 she
 had
 to
 be
 on
 those
 platforms.
 But


how
 do
 we
 in
 a,
 you
 know,
 society,
 I


love
 what
 this
 weekend
 essay
 um
 by


Katherine
 Paige
 Jeffrey
 about,
 you
 know,


learning
 how
 to
 have
 the
 right
 digital


conversation
 with
 your
 kids.
 How
 do
 you


advise
 parents
 on
 all
 of
 this?


So
 that's
 the
 number
 one
 thing.
 I
 really


love
 the
 idea
 of
 like
 we're
 not
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 create
 the
 childhoods
 of
 the


past.
 We
 live
 in
 a
 digital
 world,
 so
 the


focus
 can't
 really
 be
 on
 limiting
 or


having
 kids
 not
 use
 screens.
 It's
 what


you're
 doing,
 the
 content,
 how
 you're


viewing
 it,
 how
 can
 you
 be
 critical?
 And


so
 I
 teach
 um
 families
 to
 really
 just


ask
 them
 thoughtful
 thoughtful
 questions


to
 their
 kids
 about
 like
 what
 are
 you


looking
 at,
 how
 does
 it
 make
 you
 feel,


do
 you
 feel
 happier,
 more
 stressed,
 and


who
 who's
 made
 this
 content?
 What
 are


they
 trying
 to
 sell
 you?
 What
 does
 it
 do


to
 put
 your
 attention
 here?
 So
 those


like
 sort
 of
 thoughtful
 um
 pieces
 of


kind
 of
 how
 is
 this
 impacting
 me,
 how


how
 is
 this
 um
 connected
 to
 my
 mood
 and


why
 as
 well
 as
 thinking
 about
 what
 is


real
 and
 how
 do
 you
 figure
 out
 what
 are


good
 sources
 um
 and
 how
 to
 analyze
 what


you're
 looking
 at.


I
 think
 that
 is
 going
 to
 increasingly


become
 such
 a
 bigger
 part
 of
 our
 world.


What
 is
 the
 right
 way
 for
 parents
 to


approach
 this?
 I
 mean,
 Adam
 Miseri
 was


uh
 from
 Instagram
 was
 on
 stage
 here
 at


screen
 time
 essentially
 saying
 we
 have


to
 teach
 our
 kids
 that
 what
 you
 see
 on


the
 screen
 is
 not
 necessarily
 what's


happening
 in
 real
 life.
 What
 is
 the


right
 way
 for
 us
 to
 talk
 to
 our
 kids


about
 this?


I
 think
 that
 we
 should
 start
 off
 kind
 of


keeping
 things
 light
 cuz
 parents
 get
 so


stressed
 out
 and
 nervous
 about
 this.
 So,


I
 say,
 you
 know,
 first
 of
 all,
 just
 ask


a
 fun
 question
 like
 what's
 the
 best
 or


funniest
 or
 most
 interesting
 thing


you've
 seen
 on
 social
 media
 lately?
 And


then
 from
 there
 the
 parents
 can
 ask
 more


questions
 about
 frequency
 of
 use,
 what


platforms
 their
 child
 uses,
 what
 content


they
 consume.
 So
 that
 gives
 you
 a
 kind


of
 an
 opening
 and
 then
 you
 can
 get
 a


little
 bit
 more
 serious
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 what
 would
 you
 do
 if
 you
 saw


something
 that
 was
 upsetting
 kind
 of


listen
 non-judgmentally
 be
 open
 and
 let


them
 know
 that
 they
 can
 come
 to
 you
 um


and
 talk
 to
 you
 if
 they
 are
 have
 any


concerns.
 you
 know,
 I
 find
 it


interesting
 this,
 you
 know,
 digital


wellness
 lab
 and
 I
 am
 so
 curious
 about
 I


know
 you're
 involved
 in
 it
 and
 may
 not


know
 all
 the
 work
 that
 they
 are
 doing,


but
 give
 us
 some
 insight
 um
 into
 some
 of


the
 projects
 that
 they're
 working
 with


or
 some
 of
 the
 concerns
 that
 they
 have


and
 maybe
 there's
 also
 some,
 you
 know,
 I


don't
 want
 to
 be
 all
 negative,
 but
 I


live
 on
 this
 too
 and
 I
 find
 it
 super


helpful.
 Um,
 I'm
 curious
 about
 some
 of


the
 work
 that
 you
 guys
 are
 doing
 there.


So,
 I'm
 a
 consultant
 for
 the
 lab
 and


there's
 so
 much
 cool
 things
 happening


when
 it comes
 to
 advocacy,
 new
 research,


um,
 and
 working
 directly
 with
 youth.
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 exciting


things
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 youth
 advisory


board
 is
 kind
 of
 talking
 to
 different,


um,
 different
 different
 companies
 in


this
 space
 and
 letting
 them
 know
 how


kids
 really
 experience
 them.
 Um,
 and


then
 we're
 doing
 very
 big
 surveys
 where


we're
 finding
 out
 kind
 of
 what
 does
 this


look
 like
 in
 the
 real
 world?
 What
 are


kids
 saying?
 What
 are
 parents
 saying?


What
 are
 they
 concerned
 about?
 And
 kind


of
 on
 your
 topic
 of
 is
 there
 some


positive
 stuff
 here?
 And
 the
 answer
 is


yes.
 Kids
 can
 find
 connection,
 they
 can


find
 community,
 they
 can
 find
 good


resources.
 So
 it's
 like
 figuring
 out


what
 is
 that
 positive
 content
 and
 what


is
 the
 things
 that
 kind
 of
 make
 you
 feel


not
 as
 good.
 And
 the
 people
 we
 need
 to


listen
 to
 the
 most
 about
 this
 are


teenagers,
 our
 kids.


What
 is
 the
 right
 way
 for
 schools
 to
 to


deal
 with
 this
 technology?
 I
 was


actually
 pretty
 dismayed
 to
 find
 my


first
 grader
 came
 home
 just
 a
 few
 weeks


ago
 with
 the
 the
 way
 that
 the


assignments
 were
 working
 this
 year.


Yeah.


And
 he
 had
 an
 app,
 a
 website
 that
 he
 was


supposed
 to
 go
 to
 for
 math
 homework
 a


couple
 times
 a
 week.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 why


are
 we
 already
 doing
 this
 on
 screens?


Told
 you
 it
 starts.


Is
 it
 a
 is
 it
 a
 better
 way?
 Like
 is
 he


getting
 the
 information
 in
 a
 better
 way


than
 he
 would
 on
 paper?
 I'm
 not
 a
 lite,


but
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 why
 should
 a


first
 grader
 be
 using
 a
 screen
 for
 this?


Well,
 like
 multimodal
 learning
 is
 so


important
 for
 society
 right
 now.
 So,
 you


know,
 I'm
 hoping
 that
 your
 first
 grader


is
 also
 getting
 time
 to
 like
 manipulate


the
 math
 concepts
 in
 the
 classroom
 and


that
 the
 app
 is
 more
 of
 a
 reinforcement.


Again,
 that's
 a
 positive
 piece
 of


content.
 That's
 a
 something
 that's


something
 that's
 going
 to
 add
 to
 his


life
 versus
 kind
 of
 passively
 sitting


and
 taking
 in
 something
 that
 may
 not
 be


as
 healthy
 for
 him.
 So,
 practicing
 your


math
 skills
 at
 home
 on
 an
 app,
 that


feels
 like
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 we


want
 to
 kind
 of
 go
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 Even
 though
 it
 does
 feel
 like


here
 they
 come
 again,
 my
 kid
 is
 only


six.
 So
 why
 do
 they
 why
 do
 they
 have


technology,
 it's
 kind
 of
 putting
 all
 the


pieces
 together.


Dr.
 Sinclair,
 one
 thing
 I
 think
 about
 is


people
 who
 have
 seats
 at
 the
 table
 on


this
 or
 who
 want
 to
 have
 a
 seat
 at
 the


table
 and
 we
 certainly
 see
 the
 big
 tech


leaders
 at
 the
 White
 House.
 They're


concerned
 about
 regulatory
 oversight
 or


burdens
 um
 or
 access
 to
 markets.
 We
 see


that
 in
 a
 big
 way.
 Um
 are
 tech
 leaders


getting
 involved?
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 bring


this
 up,
 I
 remember
 doing
 a
 panel
 at


least
 10
 years
 ago
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 tech


folks
 who
 said,
 "Yeah,
 my
 kid,
 I
 don't


let
 them
 go
 on
 a
 laptop.
 There
 there's


no
 screen
 time
 for
 them."
 So,
 I'm


wondering
 if
 tech
 leaders
 are
 also


involved
 in
 this
 discussion.


Yes.
 And
 actually,
 the
 one
 of
 the
 things


that's
 been
 so
 exciting
 about
 my
 work


with
 the
 digital
 wellness
 lab
 is
 I've


gotten
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 some
 of
 those


discussions
 with
 some
 of
 the
 the
 main


tech
 companies
 where
 we're
 kind
 of


giving
 our
 insights
 as
 Boston


Children's,
 this
 place
 where
 we're
 doing


all
 kinds
 of
 research
 and
 clinical
 work


on
 kids
 behavioral
 health.
 We're
 able
 to


offer
 that
 to
 them
 in
 terms
 of
 this
 is


what
 we're
 concerned
 about.
 This
 is
 what


we're
 seeing.
 How
 can
 you
 guys
 think


about
 this
 as
 you're
 developing
 new


technologies?


All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to
 leave
 it
 on


that
 note.
 So
 glad
 we
 could
 bring
 this


in
 because
 we
 just
 think
 as
 we
 look
 at


all
 the
 content
 generation
 that
 we're


hearing
 and
 all
 the
 work
 that
 folks
 are


doing
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 media,
 sports,


gaming,
 um
 this
 is
 something
 we
 think


about
 a
 lot.
