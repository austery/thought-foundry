 the
 Norwegian
 so
 wealth
 fund
 and

 it's

 honor
 to
 welcome
 Jack


dorsy
 one
 of
 the
 most
 Visionary


entrepreneurs
 in
 the
 world
 Jack
 is
 the


co-founder
 and
 COO
 of
 block
 and
 also
 the


co-founder
 and
 former
 CEO
 of
 Twitter
 so


uh
 Jack
 you
 really
 put
 the
 stamp
 on
 the


world
 welcome
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 thank


you
 if
 we
 go
 back
 and
 and
 kick
 off
 with


uh
 Twitter
 who
 is
 now
 of
 course
 uh
 named


renamed
 X
 um
 where
 did
 the
 idea
 come


from
 uh
 it
 it
 was
 a
 long
 time
 in
 the


making
 um
 when
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 I
 was
 I
 was


always
 fascinated


by
 um
 how
 cities
 worked
 just
 how
 these


things
 that
 were
 so
 large
 to
 me
 at
 the


time
 actually
 like
 functioned
 and
 I
 got


into
 um
 maps
 and
 just
 I
 would
 obsess


over
 them
 and
 stare
 at
 them
 and
 try
 to


understand
 what
 was
 happening
 in
 anyone


particular
 neighborhood
 or
 area
 and
 that


led
 me
 to
 um
 programming
 because
 my
 dad


brought
 home
 a
 computer
 one
 time
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 draw
 a
 map
 on
 the
 screen
 so


that
 I
 could
 start
 playing
 with
 it
 and
 I


you
 know
 I
 taught
 myself
 how
 to
 do
 that


I
 figured
 it
 out
 and
 little
 by
 little
 I


worked
 my
 way
 to
 a
 a
 field
 called


dispatch
 so
 dispatching
 taxi
 cabs
 and


ambulances
 and
 police
 cars
 and
 it
 was
 a


way
 to
 put
 information
 on
 the
 map
 um


information
 about
 the
 city
 and
 I


eventually
 ended
 up
 working
 at
 the


largest
 firm
 in
 New
 York
 and
 had
 this


very
 rich
 map
 of
 everything
 happening
 in


New
 York
 City
 but
 it
 was
 missing
 one


thing
 which
 were
 the
 people
 and
 what


they
 were
 doing
 where
 they
 were
 and


that's
 really
 the
 question
 that
 started


Twitter
 was
 um
 if
 I
 could
 see
 and


visualize
 what
 the
 people
 were
 doing
 and


what
 they
 were
 thinking
 or
 where
 they


were
 going
 uh
 it
 would
 help
 me


understand
 the
 the
 city
 a
 little
 bit


more
 and
 it
 took
 probably
 about
 10
 15


years
 for
 the
 right
 time
 and
 the
 right


technology
 to
 to
 really
 make
 the
 idea
 um


something
 worth
 pursuing
 but
 in
 2006
 it


did
 and
 I
 was
 working
 at
 a
 a
 podcasting


company
 that
 kind
 of
 lost
 its
 way


because
 it
 suddenly
 became
 competitive


with
 apple
 when
 Apple
 decided
 to
 get


into
 podcasting
 and
 um
 we
 had
 this
 great


team
 we
 started
 a
 hack
 week
 I
 brought
 up


the
 idea
 for
 this
 thing
 that
 you
 could


update
 from
 your
 phone
 and
 other
 people


could
 follow
 it
 and
 see
 what
 you're


doing
 and
 what
 you're
 thinking
 and
 where


are
 you're


going
 and
 we
 I
 was
 given
 another


programmer
 in
 two
 weeks
 and
 we
 built
 it


and
 we
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 it
 and
 little


by
 little
 we
 took
 more
 and
 more


resources
 of
 the
 other
 company
 and
 we


eventually
 spun
 out
 and
 took
 um
 Venture


Capital
 what
 what
 was
 your
 vision
 at
 the


time
 what
 did
 you
 think
 it
 could
 become


I
 didn't
 really
 have
 a
 vision
 I
 I
 wanted


to
 play
 with
 it
 I
 mean
 ultimately
 I


wanted
 to
 understand
 what
 was
 happening


in
 the
 city
 that
 was
 the
 original


question
 and
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 a
 way
 to


answer
 the
 question
 but
 um
 I
 just
 wanted


to
 use
 it
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 able
 to
 see


what
 my
 friends
 were
 doing
 I
 wanted
 to


share
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 um
 SMS
 was
 just


becoming
 big
 in
 the
 US
 you
 all
 in
 Europe


had
 it
 for
 10
 years
 prior
 but
 the
 us


because
 of
 our
 different
 protocols
 for


carriers
 Verizon
 and
 AT&T
 GSM
 versus


CDMA
 we
 didn't
 have
 text
 messages
 that


actually
 um
 worked
 together
 so
 we
 didn't


have
 text
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 um
 but


when
 we
 did
 that
 was
 the
 technology
 like


oh
 you
 can
 uh
 I
 could
 have
 this
 cheap


little
 Nokia
 device
 and
 I
 could
 send
 a


message
 and
 it
 would
 fan
 out
 to
 all
 the


people
 that
 cared
 about
 what
 I
 was


saying
 or
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 that
 was


super
 cool
 and
 we
 um
 we
 just
 launched
 it


and
 we
 invited
 our
 friends
 and
 they


invited
 their
 friends
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


forth
 and
 then
 it
 continued
 to
 roll
 and


we
 decided
 as
 people
 were
 using
 it
 that


there's
 something
 that
 resonates
 here


there's
 something
 interesting
 and
 now


it's
 up
 to
 us
 to
 like
 really
 pull
 the


thread
 on
 what
 that
 is
 and
 what's


interesting
 about
 Twitter
 is
 it
 wasn't


really
 us
 who
 determined
 where
 it
 went


it
 was
 the
 people
 using
 it
 we
 saw
 them


try
 to
 converse
 with
 each
 other
 and
 um


address
 one


another
 and
 I
 took
 three
 days
 over


breakfast
 and
 I
 wrote
 or
 three
 hours
 and


I
 I
 wrote
 some
 code
 anytime
 someone


tried
 to
 address
 someone
 else
 it
 would


be
 linked
 and
 it
 would
 be
 filtered
 into


a
 replies
 tuab
 is
 what
 I
 called
 it


and
 that
 started
 conversation
 on
 Twitter


and
 this
 public
 conversation
 where


whereas
 I
 originally
 was
 thinking
 oh


this
 is
 just
 a
 way
 to
 update
 my
 friends


of
 what
 I'm
 doing
 see
 what
 they're
 doing


but
 people
 wanted
 to
 talk
 and
 they


invented
 the
 syntax
 the
 at
 symbol
 to


talk
 and
 then
 they
 invented
 another


syntax
 the
 hash
 for


grouping
 um
 topic
 group
 grouping
 tweets


by
 topics
 and
 then
 they
 invented
 another


thing
 called
 the
 retweet
 which
 is


rebroadcasting
 someone
 they're
 following


to
 to
 their
 following
 U
 to
 the
 people


following
 them
 so
 little
 by
 little
 as
 we


observed
 what
 people
 were
 doing
 with
 it


we
 made
 it
 easier
 it
 spread
 and
 it
 made


the
 service
 much
 bigger
 because
 more
 and


more
 people
 got
 value
 out
 of
 it
 and
 uh


it
 was
 just
 an
 interesting
 way
 to


co-create


with
 the
 people
 that
 are
 using
 your


product
 and
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 it


that's
 amazing
 so
 the
 way
 um
 the
 way
 it


developed
 um
 what
 does
 it
 tell
 us
 about


people's
 needs
 what
 does
 it
 tell
 us


about
 people


generally
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 um
 people
 don't


want
 to
 just
 consume
 they
 want
 to
 help


participation
 means
 creation
 and
 um
 and


they
 want
 to
 they
 want
 to
 leave
 some


Mark
 um
 they
 may
 not
 intend
 to
 do
 that


but
 when
 you
 use
 something
 like
 Twitter


you
 develop
 this
 feeling
 for
 it
 and
 you


want
 want
 it
 to
 last
 you
 want
 it
 to


succeed
 and
 you
 you
 become
 very


emotional
 about
 any
 changes
 that
 are


made
 that
 you
 think
 go
 against
 the
 way


it
 should
 be
 or
 the
 way
 it's
 used
 and
 we


saw
 so
 many
 of
 those
 when
 we
 tried
 to
 do


a
 thing
 that
 we
 thought
 was
 important


the
 network
 just
 like
 threw
 up
 on
 it
 and


uh
 and
 said
 it
 was
 wrong
 and
 as
 we


observed
 what
 they
 were
 trying
 to
 do
 we


had
 much
 better
 insight
 into
 what


Twitter
 wanted
 to
 be
 um
 and
 as
 we
 got


more
 new
 audiences
 and
 audience
 types
 we


would


you
 know
 that
 density
 of
 information


would
 would
 grow
 even
 further
 so
 when


did
 you
 realize
 that
 he
 was
 really


taking
 off
 when
 Obama
 was
 elected
 100


days
 after
 he
 took
 office
 he
 got
 up
 in


front
 of
 the
 country
 and
 did
 the
 State


of
 the
 Union
 100
 days
 after
 and
 uh
 we


had
 a
 number
 of
 uh
 senators
 and
 Congress


people
 on
 Twitter
 already
 and
 I
 was


watching
 the


speech
 and
 the
 camera
 panned
 around
 and


there
 were
 people
 on
 their
 phones


and
 in
 that
 moment
 I
 got
 a


tweet
 my
 pocket
 bust
 I
 pulled
 on
 my


phone
 I
 got
 a
 tweet
 from
 my
 senator
 from


Missouri
 I'm
 from
 Missouri
 and
 she
 was


tweeting
 about
 Barack
 Obama
 giving
 his


first
 address
 to
 the
 nation
 I
 like
 whoa


like


um
 fast
 I'm
 watching
 this
 thing
 unfold


in
 front
 of
 me
 and
 I'm
 feeling
 it


physically
 in
 my
 pocket
 and
 uh
 it
 just


really
 shortened
 the
 distance
 between


something
 that
 can
 be
 very
 abstract
 and


feel
 far
 away
 which
 is
 how
 our


government
 operates
 and
 works
 to
 now


being
 in
 my
 hand
 um
 and
 having
 this


sense
 of
 like
 wow
 this
 tangible
 Humanity


someone
 typed
 this
 out
 it
 buzzed
 my


phone
 and
 and
 now
 I'm
 reading
 it
 and
 I


saw
 it
 in
 you
 know
 they
 thousands
 of


miles
 away
 what
 did
 you
 feel
 then
 oh
 I


felt
 excited
 I
 got
 back
 to
 work
 right


away
 because
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 man
 this
 is
 a


this
 feels
 great
 I
 mean
 that
 that's
 what


you
 want
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 building
 any


product
 you
 want
 to
 see
 people
 use
 it
 in


a
 way
 that
 you
 can
 see
 that
 there's


value
 and
 you
 can
 feel
 it
 it
 feels


electric
 and
 um
 you
 feel
 like
 tingly
 and


you're
 like
 oh
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 G
 keep
 going


I'm
 G
 keep
 going
 when
 you
 see
 how


important
 social
 media
 platforms
 have


become
 in
 election
 campaigns
 um
 what
 are


your
 Reflections
 around
 that
 these


things
 aren't
 important
 by
 themselves
 we


make
 them
 important
 and
 we
 choose
 to
 by


giving
 them


attention
 um
 give
 them


importance
 and
 um


it
 it
 spoke
 to
 a
 gap
 that
 I
 think


existed
 before
 Twitter
 which
 was


everything
 was
 entirely
 scripted
 it
 was


behind
 a
 media
 wall


um
 the
 information
 that
 you
 got
 was


through
 another
 point
 of
 view
 typically


a
 corporate
 point
 of
 view
 corporate


media
 point
 of
 view
 paid
 for
 by


advertisers
 and
 seen
 on
 television
 or


radio
 or
 whatnot


um
 podcasts
 were
 the
 first
 to
 in
 in
 my


experience
 to
 really
 break
 that
 wall
 but


they
 weren't
 talking
 about
 newsworthy


stuff
 at
 that
 point
 they
 were
 just
 doing


like
 interviews
 and
 and
 whatnot
 and
 they


they
 mature
 it
 eventually
 but
 but


Twitter
 kind
 of
 pierced
 through
 it
 very


very
 quickly
 and
 it
 pierc
 through
 that


that
 wall
 of
 abstraction
 media


abstraction
 and
 um
 I
 think
 for
 elections


again
 our
 political
 process
 our


government
 can
 be
 extremely
 abstract
 and


when
 you
 have
 something
 thing
 that
 you


know
 is
 90
 nine
 times
 out
 of
 10
 coming


from
 the
 person's
 thumbs
 directly
 which


is
 connected
 directly
 to
 their
 brain


it's
 authentic
 it's


unfiltered
 um
 and
 it's
 open
 to
 your


interpretation
 instead
 of
 being
 filtered


by
 someone
 else's


interpretation
 so
 it
 was
 less
 about


Twitter
 providing
 that
 it
 was
 more
 like


that
 was
 the
 need
 and
 that
 was
 the
 um


the
 desire
 and
 anything
 at
 that
 time


that
 could
 fill
 that
 would
 have
 taken


off
 I
 think
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 luck
 we
 had


a
 great
 product
 because
 it
 was
 simple
 it


was
 straightforward
 it
 was
 easy
 to
 use


and
 it
 was


accessible
 but
 it
 also
 was
 the
 right


time
 like
 the
 the
 frustration
 with
 the


media
 wall
 was
 at
 a
 Peak
 at
 a
 high
 and


it
 was
 there
 there
 were
 cracks
 in
 it
 and


people
 wanted
 more
 of
 that
 they
 wanted


more
 authenticity
 they
 wanted
 more


directness
 they
 wanted
 more
 realness
 um


it's
 very
 concentrated
 right
 so
 I


believe
 10
 10%
 of
 people
 generate
 80%
 of


the


content
 80%
 of


the
 organic
 non-re
 reply


content
 like
 there
 are
 repes
 too
 and
 um


that's
 not
 often
 counted
 in
 that
 number


so
 me
 just
 sending
 out
 a
 tweet
 yes


you're
 right
 but
 I
 think
 the
 real
 power


of
 Twitter
 is
 the
 conversation


underneath
 it
 and
 um
 it's
 not


necessarily
 about
 you
 know
 what
 is
 the


news
 of
 the
 day
 direct
 from
 The
 Source


it's
 like
 what
 are
 people
 talking
 about


it
 what
 do
 people
 think
 about
 the
 news


of
 the
 day
 that
 that
 that's
 the
 power


and
 and
 that
 um
 is
 is
 extremely
 large


and
 then
 there's
 the
 yeah
 like
 Twitter


acts
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 influential
 people


on
 it
 and
 people
 want
 to
 listen
 to
 them


and
 such
 that
 these
 tweets
 were
 being


broadcast
 on
 television
 and
 we
 were


unable
 to
 count
 the
 impressions
 of
 CNN


or
 Fox
 putting
 a
 tweet
 up
 um
 but
 we
 knew


the
 reach
 was
 much
 larger
 than
 our


analytics
 and
 our
 measurements
 accounted


for
 so
 that
 was
 that
 was
 pretty


interesting
 pretty
 special
 now
 two
 years


ago
 um
 alen
 musk
 bought
 it
 and
 renamed


it
 X
 anything
 um
 you
 regret
 not
 doing


with
 Twitter
 before
 it
 became
 X
 I
 mean


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 I
 would
 do


differently
 in
 retrospect


um
 I
 think
 we


became
 we


I
 I
 wasn't
 there
 at
 the
 time
 running
 the


company
 but


we
 we
 um
 race
 to
 uh
 monetization
 way
 too


quickly
 and
 we
 force
 fitted
 a


monetization
 path
 that
 created
 a
 bunch


of
 issues
 for
 us
 which
 was


advertising
 Google
 had
 an
 advertising


business
 at
 scale
 uh
 Facebook
 had
 one


that
 was
 growing
 um
 Twitter's
 goal
 at


that
 point
 was
 to
 grow
 and
 go
 public


being
 public
 meant
 you
 had
 Revenue
 so
 we


copied
 the
 model
 of
 the
 day
 model
 of
 the


internet
 which
 was
 advertising
 and
 that


just
 set
 up
 a
 bunch
 of
 issues
 um
 in


terms
 of
 growth
 in
 terms
 of
 um


competition
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 we
 were


valued
 um
 it
 didn't
 really
 Express


Twitter's
 True
 Value
 that
 model
 and
 I


wish
 we
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time
 to


figure
 out
 a
 better
 model
 or
 the
 we


um
 that
 we
 uh
 had
 multiple
 at
 once
 the


second
 thing
 is
 in
 the
 early
 days


Twitter
 felt
 like
 a
 protocol
 it
 felt


like
 a
 HTTP
 it
 felt
 like


SMTP
 yet
 we
 owned
 every
 single
 part
 of


the
 stack
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 mistake


because
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 company
 can


necessarily
 control
 this
 without
 having


some
 sort
 of
 choke
 point
 that
 makes
 it


open
 to
 manipulation
 of
 some
 way
 so
 if


you
 have
 a
 open
 protocol
 for
 social


media
 which
 I
 think
 Twitter
 could
 have


been
 instead
 of
 just
 a
 company
 it
 could


have
 been
 both
 um
 you
 have
 a
 a
 lot
 more


freedom
 and
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 agility


to
 do
 the
 things
 that
 the
 platform


actually
 needs
 to
 do
 and
 the
 protocol


needs
 to
 do
 but
 if
 you
 wrap
 all
 that
 up


in
 one
 company
 um
 you
 have
 a
 you
 create


a
 lot
 of
 issues
 for
 yourself
 um


including
 heads
 of
 government
 and


advertis
 ERS
 wanting
 to
 dictate
 content


policy
 um
 or
 get
 the
 numbers
 of


journalists
 who
 are
 uh
 critiquing
 them


or
 shut
 you
 down
 because
 you
 won't
 take


content
 down
 in
 their
 country
 um
 if
 it


was
 a
 protocol


instead
 that
 was
 owned
 by
 the
 public
 and


you're
 building
 a
 business
 on
 top
 of


that
 you
 couldn't
 do
 those
 things
 um


this
 is
 where
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 from


Bitcoin
 do
 you
 think
 uh
 it
 could
 have


existed
 without
 advertising
 oh
 yeah
 yeah


definitely
 and
 financed
 in
 what
 way


there's
 tons
 there's
 subscription


there's
 Commerce
 um
 the
 uh
 you
 know


because
 because
 the
 internet
 didn't
 have


was
 not
 born
 with
 a
 native
 currency


protocol
 advertising
 was
 the
 way
 to


subsidize
 free
 um
 free
 services
 and
 it


would
 it
 it
 was
 taken
 as
 a
 given
 that


these
 internet
 businesses
 had
 be


advertising
 businesses
 in
 the
 early


early
 days
 Netflix
 showed
 a
 different


path
 um
 obviously
 others
 eBay
 showed
 a


different
 path
 but
 for
 an
 information


tool
 like
 we
 were
 advertising
 was
 it
 it


was
 the
 way
 to
 get
 the
 biggest
 Network


because
 you
 could
 offer
 it
 for
 free
 and


subsidize
 it
 but
 the
 but
 the
 reality
 is


the
 people
 that
 are
 using
 it
 are
 truly


the
 product
 and
 your
 customer
 is
 the


advertiser
 and
 your
 customer
 is


dictating
 where
 the
 product
 should
 go


you
 are
 still
 a
 large
 owner
 uh
 in
 X
 mhm


what
 do
 you
 think
 they
 should
 do
 with
 X


now
 uh
 experiment
 as
 much
 as
 possible
 I


mean
 like
 keep
 pulling
 the
 thread
 on


what
 people
 want
 to
 use
 it
 for
 um
 I'm
 a


big
 believer


in
 like
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 think
 it's


less
 about
 free
 speech
 I
 think
 it's
 more


about
 do
 we
 get
 to
 choose
 how
 the


algorithms
 are
 programming
 us
 because


the
 algorithms
 are
 definitively


programming
 us
 and
 uh
 it's
 very
 very


hard
 to
 tell
 what
 an
 algorithm
 is
 going


to
 do
 and
 predict
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 do


and
 that's
 where
 the
 danger
 comes
 in
 but


if
 I
 can
 choose
 what
 algorithm
 filters


my
 tweets
 and
 what
 I
 get
 to
 see
 and
 I


have
 instead
 of
 like
 an
 app
 store
 an


algorithm
 store
 um
 where
 I
 get
 to
 put


these
 on
 my
 my
 timeline
 then
 I
 have
 a


lot
 more
 agency
 in
 the
 content
 and
 the


experience
 and
 I
 think
 it
 ends
 up


creating
 a
 much
 healthier
 relationship


with
 the
 technology
 and
 I'm
 not
 just


speaking
 about
 Twitter
 this
 is
 for
 for


YouTube
 and
 for
 financial
 Technologies


um
 we
 are
 being
 programmed
 uh
 these


algorithms
 know
 our
 preferences
 better


than
 us
 that's
 only
 going
 to
 increase


how
 do
 we
 increase
 agency
 at
 the


individual
 level
 it's
 by
 choice
 it's
 by


being
 able
 to
 turn
 off
 the
 algorithm


it's
 by
 being
 able
 to
 choose
 different


algorithms
 it's
 being
 by
 being
 able
 to


make
 my
 own
 algorithm
 so
 Jack
 what
 kind


of
 algorithms
 are
 you
 are
 you
 thinking


of
 here
 well
 I
 mean
 a
 simple
 one
 like
 if


I
 were


um
 more
 left
 or
 right
 leaning
 I
 could


choose
 a
 more
 right
 or
 left
 leaning


algorithm
 if
 I
 hated
 politics
 and
 I
 only


wanted
 to
 focus
 on
 science
 and
 um
 Arts
 I


could
 choose
 an
 algorithm
 that
 filtered


everything
 out
 but
 those
 things
 um
 I


could
 go
 deeper
 into
 that
 I
 could
 only


do
 physics
 I
 could
 only
 do
 quantum


physics
 and
 you
 might
 say
 well
 you
 can


do
 that
 through
 taxonomies
 and


categories
 but
 there's
 just
 too
 much


information
 at
 this
 point
 um
 for
 those


to
 really
 be
 useful
 you
 have
 to
 get
 into


the
 algorithmic
 aspects
 of
 it
 and
 really


effectively
 create
 these
 agents
 that
 go


off
 and
 fetch
 you
 information
 that


you're
 truly
 interested
 in
 and
 um
 and


deliver
 it
 back
 to
 you
 and
 take
 feedback


on
 whether
 it
 was
 useful
 to
 you
 or
 not


if
 you
 learned
 something
 from
 it
 or
 not


or
 you
 interacted
 with
 it
 or
 not
 right


now
 most
 of
 these
 internet
 companies
 and


most
 of
 these
 internet
 services
 the


algorithm
 is
 driven
 towards
 one
 thing


which
 is
 maximizing
 Impressions
 to


maximize
 advertising
 Revenue
 that
 is
 not


that
 is
 not
 maximizing
 my
 experience
 my


learning
 of
 the
 world
 or
 um
 aligned
 with


my
 goals
 as
 an
 individual
 but
 if
 it


shows
 you
 what
 you
 have
 shown
 to
 be


interested
 in
 is
 that
 not
 a
 good
 thing


oh
 it's
 a
 great
 thing
 but
 I
 I
 want
 to
 be


able
 to
 choose
 that
 and
 you
 can
 build
 a


great
 business
 around
 that
 um
 you
 can


sell
 the
 algorithms
 you
 can
 subscribe
 to


them
 you
 can
 put
 more
 directed
 topical


advertising
 on
 these
 algorithms
 because


they
 actually
 are
 programmed
 in
 a
 way


that
 you're
 actually
 interested
 in
 the


outcomes
 they're
 not
 just
 random
 um
 and


they're
 not
 trying
 to
 guess
 they
 know
 so


like
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 it
 lends
 itself
 to
 a


much
 better
 business
 but
 you
 have
 to


have
 companies
 and
 individuals
 who
 are


willing
 to
 let
 go
 of
 the
 secret
 sauce


which
 is
 the
 algorithm
 and
 and


democratize
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 how


will
 um
 generative
 AI
 change
 the
 way
 we


use
 this
 I
 think
 we're
 seeing
 the
 sense


to
 that
 right
 now
 like
 I
 I
 think
 um
 I


think
 we're
 at
 you
 know
 the
 edge
 of
 one


horizon
 I
 think
 the
 next
 Horizon
 for


these
 for
 these
 tools
 is
 probably
 around


agent
 systems
 and
 and
 software
 that
 I


task
 to
 do
 things
 for
 me
 and
 they
 work


with
 other
 agents
 uh
 on
 the
 on
 the


internet
 um
 to
 complete
 those


tests
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 more
 interested
 in
 that


um
 I
 think
 the
 generative
 AI
 stuff
 um


especially
 the
 large
 language
 models


have
 the
 ability
 to
 obviously
 create
 a


bunch
 of
 information
 and
 it
 becomes


important
 like
 what
 is
 real
 what
 is


reality
 what
 is
 truth
 what
 um
 what
 is


fictional
 and
 these
 tools
 are
 going
 to


get
 so
 good
 that
 like
 you
 won't
 be
 able


to
 tell
 and
 we'll
 truly
 feel
 like
 we're


in
 a
 simulation


because
 it
 looks
 like
 and
 we
 perceive


that
 anything
 literally
 can
 happen
 or


could
 happen
 or
 did
 happen
 because
 these


tools
 are
 so
 really
 real
 istic
 and
 feel


so
 authentic
 um
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 only


way
 around
 that
 really
 is
 you
 know
 to


just
 have
 more
 information
 and
 better


filters
 which
 leads
 to
 agents
 and
 and


and
 that
 they'
 be
 directed
 by
 Me
 by
 the


individual
 and
 and
 do
 more
 of
 that
 work


so
 I'm
 less
 interested
 right
 now
 around


llms
 and
 generative
 AI
 because
 I
 do


think
 we've
 we've
 hit
 some
 Horizon
 on
 it


and
 more
 interested
 by
 how
 you
 take
 this


uh
 intelligence
 and
 make
 it
 mobile
 uh


and
 and
 make
 it
 something
 that
 like


people
 can
 send
 off
 and
 and
 actually
 it


can
 do
 work
 for
 them
 given
 what
 we


talked
 about
 in
 terms
 of
 algorithms
 and


generative
 AI
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for


journalism
 I
 mean
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 a


journalist
 but
 like
 I
 think
 uh
 having


more
 information
 more
 perspective
 and


um
 getting
 better
 tools
 to
 get
 more


information
 and
 better
 information
 and


distill
 it
 only
 helps
 your
 Craft
 um
 I
 I


think
 it
 you
 know
 it
 does
 become
 more


and
 more
 challenging
 because
 you
 again


have
 to
 sift
 through
 what's
 real
 and


what's
 fake
 but
 you
 know
 people
 have


been
 lying
 since
 the
 dawn
 of
 time
 and


the
 dawn
 of
 language


and
 uh
 journalists
 have
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 the
 lie
 and
 what's
 Truth
 uh
 and


they
 need
 different
 perspectives
 so
 I


think
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 changes
 here


is
 velocity
 nothing
 else
 velocity
 and


breath
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 content


moderation
 I
 think
 the
 best
 content


moderation
 is
 an
 algorithm
 and
 I
 should


be
 able
 to
 determine
 my
 own
 algorithm


and
 what
 I
 see
 and
 what
 I
 don't
 see
 I


think
 there
 should
 be
 a
 corpus
 of


content
 that
 exists
 that
 only
 the
 author


of
 it
 can
 delete
 and
 they
 have
 the
 sole


right
 to
 do
 so
 um
 but
 I
 have
 the
 right


as
 an
 individual
 to
 filter
 out
 what
 I


don't
 want
 to
 see
 or
 filter
 up
 what
 I
 do


want
 to
 see
 but
 that's
 all
 dependent


upon
 whether
 I
 get
 to
 choose
 the


algorithm
 if
 a
 corporation
 is
 choosing


it
 for
 me
 based
 on
 um
 advertising


maximizing
 advertising
 Revenue
 then
 it's


not
 truly
 serving
 me
 not
 not
 useful
 I


guess
 this
 leads
 us
 to
 um
 to
 Blue
 Sky


and
 uh
 you
 helped
 create
 this


decentralized
 social
 platform
 which
 is


called
 Blue
 Sky
 so
 um
 could
 you
 take
 us


through
 the
 the
 thinking
 here
 yeah
 about


um
 three
 years
 before
 I
 left
 uh


Twitter
 um


I
 uh
 I
 realized
 that
 like
 what
 we
 were


talking
 about
 earlier
 a
 company
 cannot


be
 all
 parts
 of
 the
 stack
 for
 social


media
 it'd
 be
 better
 if
 we
 were
 built
 on


top
 of
 a
 protocol
 that
 was
 shared


between
 multiple
 companies
 and
 what
 am
 I


what's
 an
 example
 here
 HTTP
 the
 protocol


that
 runs
 the
 web
 um
 the
 protocol
 that


we're
 using
 to
 talk
 right
 now
 and
 record


this


podcast
 it's
 a
 common
 understanding
 and


that
 um
 in
 agreement
 that
 this
 is
 how
 we


transmit
 data
 in
 a
 very
 particular
 way


and
 then
 you
 have
 browsers
 on
 top
 of
 it


I'm
 using
 Safari
 you
 might
 be
 using


Firefox
 or
 Chrome
 um
 these
 are
 built
 by


different
 companies
 these
 companies
 can


build
 business
 models
 on
 top
 of
 that
 but


they're
 using
 the
 same
 protocol
 and
 they


don't
 control
 the
 protocol
 they
 they


can't
 influence
 the
 direction
 of
 it
 as
 a


single
 entity
 it
 has
 to
 be
 done
 through


this
 consensus
 model
 um


so
 if
 we
 have
 that
 for
 the
 web
 if
 we


have
 that
 for
 email
 if
 we
 have
 it
 for


file
 transfer
 for
 video
 why
 not
 have
 it


for
 social
 media
 why
 not
 build
 a


protocol
 that
 any
 company
 whether
 it
 be


Facebook
 or
 Google
 or
 X
 um
 or
 open


source
 tools
 can
 use
 around
 this
 concept


of
 social
 media
 and
 that
 was
 the
 idea


and
 we
 we
 called
 it
 Blue
 Sky
 um
 and
 it


we
 took
 about
 a
 year
 to
 find
 a
 leader


for
 it
 we
 found
 a
 leader


uh
 and
 this
 woman
 named


Jay
 and
 she
 built
 a
 team
 and
 uh
 actually


built
 it
 and
 built
 the
 protocol
 and


built
 a
 client
 and
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


working
 there's
 another
 one
 uh
 another


individual
 from
 Brazil
 I
 don't
 know
 who


this
 person
 is
 it's
 a


pseudonym
 he
 created
 this
 um
 this
 other


protocol
 called
 Noster
 n
 o


s
 had
 a
 different
 take
 on
 it
 uh
 which


was
 he
 kind
 of
 looked
 at
 every
 single


one
 of
 Twitter's
 fail
 failings
 as
 he
 saw


it
 and
 built
 his
 own
 protocol
 and
 what


was
 interesting
 about
 that
 protocol
 I


found
 it
 um
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago


was
 that
 um
 not
 only
 did
 it
 address
 what


I
 perceived
 on
 every
 one
 of
 our
 problems


but
 it
 was
 completely
 open
 in
 terms
 of


the
 development
 model
 Blue
 Sky
 was


effectively
 this
 Corporation
 building


the
 API
 and
 building
 the
 protocol
 Noster


was
 just
 a
 bunch
 of
 individuals
 building


the
 protocol
 and
 building
 the
 clients
 on


top
 of
 it
 and
 I
 resonate
 a
 lot
 more
 with


that
 um
 because
 I
 think
 the
 at
 the


protocol
 level
 it
 has
 to
 be
 done
 not


through
 a
 corporation
 but
 through
 a


collection
 of
 uh
 interested
 and
 obsessed


individuals
 and
 that's
 what
 Noster
 was


So
 eventually
 I
 stepped
 off
 the
 Blue
 Sky


board
 and
 um
 and
 really
 focused
 a
 lot
 of


my
 efforts
 which
 amounted
 to
 funding
 the


ecoystem
 around
 Noster
 Noster
 is
 still


very
 small
 because
 it's
 a
 lot
 more


technical
 at
 the
 moment
 but
 I
 have
 a
 lot


of
 Hope
 for
 it
 because
 of
 the
 way
 it's


built
 it
 follows
 the
 way
 that
 Linux
 was


built
 it
 follows
 the
 way
 that
 Unix
 was


built
 it
 follows
 the
 way
 that
 the
 C


programming
 language
 was
 built
 versus


these
 other
 like
 Cathedral
 type
 models


which
 achieved
 perfect
 tried
 to
 achieve


Perfection
 but
 actually
 no
 one
 ended
 up


using
 um
 because
 they
 were
 built
 by


these
 companies
 and
 these
 companies
 had


these
 particular
 agendas
 and
 there
 was


no
 real
 Drive
 individual
 Drive
 behind


them
 so
 blue
 sky
 is
 a
 very
 different


model
 than
 Noster
 I
 think
 the
 Nostra


model
 lasts
 longer
 and
 wins
 but
 it's


good
 to
 have
 multiple
 experiences
 and


there's
 others
 there's
 Maston
 and


there's
 Matrix
 and
 um
 there's
 a


what
 uh
 meta
 is
 doing
 with
 threads
 like


all
 these
 all
 these
 things
 are
 kind
 of


competing
 with
 each
 other
 but
 one
 of


them


wi
 why
 is
 Blue
 Sky
 growing
 so
 fast
 now


you
 think
 I
 think
 people
 are
 running


away
 from
 X
 rather
 than
 running
 to


something
 on
 Blue


Sky
 um
 and
 that's
 not
 a


great
 uh
 way
 to
 build
 a
 product
 to


unfortunately
 um
 we
 want
 people
 that
 are


running
 to
 us
 for
 a
 particular
 thing


that
 they
 couldn't
 do
 before
 now
 blue


sky
 has
 built
 something
 that
 um
 I
 wanted


it
 to
 build
 and
 I'm
 excited
 about
 which


is
 is
 this
 algorithm
 store
 being
 able
 to


choose
 your
 own
 algorithms
 so
 that
 is
 a


reason
 why
 people
 will
 run
 to
 it


eventually
 and
 I
 think
 why
 people
 run
 to


these
 Services
 eventually
 because
 they


get
 more
 agency
 and
 more
 control
 um
 but


it's
 not
 something
 that
 people
 care


about
 right
 now
 what
 they
 care
 about


right
 now
 is
 not
 being
 in
 X
 for
 whatever


personal
 reason
 um
 and
 again
 that
 that


that
 sort
 of
 behavior
 kind
 of
 comes
 in


waves
 um
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 want
 to


stay
 there
 for
 a
 reason
 you
 can
 stay


there
 because
 you
 have
 moved
 your
 entire


community
 over
 which
 is
 rare
 but
 when
 we


have
 these
 different
 factions
 of
 Social


Services
 if
 x
 represents
 the
 right
 and


blue
 sky
 represents
 the
 left
 and
 they


can't
 actually
 talk
 with
 each
 other


there's
 going
 to
 be
 crossover
 naturally


because
 people
 are
 going
 to
 keep
 their


accounts
 because
 they
 want
 to
 hear
 what


the
 other
 side
 is
 saying
 it's
 just


natural
 only
 way
 to
 solve
 this
 one


protocol
 different
 views
 different


algorithms
 on
 top
 this
 can
 be
 the
 right


this
 can
 be
 the
 left
 different
 business


models
 this
 one
 works
 this
 one
 doesn't


work
 as
 well
 but
 we
 need
 a
 common


protocol
 and
 that's
 that's
 the
 whole


idea
 what's
 going
 to
 make
 Noster
 a


takeoff
 time
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 better
 technology
 I
 think
 is
 a
 much


healthier
 developer


ecosystem
 um
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 just


social
 media
 like
 blue
 sky
 is
 trying
 to


be
 it's
 it's
 more
 of
 this
 ecosystem
 of


apps
 with
 a
 common
 protocol
 um
 so
 people


have
 built


um
 twitter-
 like
 things
 they
 built


spreadsheet
 like
 Google
 Sheets
 like


things
 they
 built
 GitHub
 like
 things
 and


it's
 really
 amazing
 because
 um
 what
 it


what
 it
 does
 is
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 really


prove
 authenticity
 because
 it's
 a
 public


private
 key
 pair
 system
 it's
 not
 a
 email


and
 password
 I
 have
 a
 public
 key
 and
 I


have
 a
 secret
 key
 and
 I
 maintain
 the


secret
 key
 and
 every
 message
 I
 send
 on


Noster


um
 I'm
 signing
 with
 my
 secret
 key
 so
 you


know
 it's
 actually
 coming
 from
 me
 and
 my


device
 which
 is
 very
 unlike
 a
 Twitter
 or


a
 Facebook
 where
 you
 don't
 actually
 know


it
 could
 be
 intercepted
 it
 could
 be
 the


company
 doing
 it
 um
 on
 the
 Pres
 in
 the


worst
 case
 on
 the
 person's
 behalf
 um
 but


because
 I
 control
 my
 key
 you
 know


anything
 I
 write
 or
 anything
 I
 post
 is


coming
 from
 me
 directly
 five
 years
 from


now
 what
 does
 social
 media
 look


like
 I
 I
 hope
 that
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 um


agent
 driven
 um
 I
 hope
 that
 it
 has
 a
 lot


more
 agency
 in
 being
 able
 to
 choose
 how


I
 filter
 content
 how
 I
 promote
 content


um
 I
 hope
 that
 all
 content


exists
 permanently
 effectively
 um


because
 it's
 it
 gives
 us
 the
 greatest


learning


opportunity
 and
 um
 I
 think
 there's


business
 models
 that
 are
 more
 aligned


with
 the
 interests
 of
 the
 IND
 individual


and
 not
 just
 a
 company
 um
 so
 and
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 bots
 on
 it
 and
 I


think
 they'll
 be
 helpful
 not
 distracting


or
 uh
 providing
 you
 know
 um


misinformation
 but
 actually
 useful
 where


do
 you
 think
 uh
 regulation
 of
 online


platform
 is
 going
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 I
 the


the
 problem
 I
 I
 see
 there's
 a
 bigger


problem
 which
 is
 I
 think
 regulation


generally
 is
 becoming
 more
 and
 more


fragmented
 and
 and
 um
 it's
 really
 really


hard
 on
 companies


to
 build
 for
 a
 fragmented
 regulatory


environment
 California
 has
 a
 very


different


regulatory
 understanding
 than
 the


European
 Union
 and
 you
 look
 at
 like


internet
 regulation
 states
 are
 now


considering
 internet
 regulation


Australia
 just
 banned
 um
 social
 media


for
 anyone
 under
 18
 it's
 the


responsibility
 of
 the
 social
 media
 a


platform
 to
 make
 it
 so
 and
 that's


different
 from
 Europe
 and
 that's


different
 from
 the
 US
 and
 that's


different
 from
 the
 entire
 rest
 of
 the


world
 so
 now
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 team


that's
 dedicated
 just
 to
 Australia
 for


this
 one
 restriction
 and
 if
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 follows
 with
 their
 own


specific


regulatory
 uh
 aspects
 then
 you
 can't


build
 a
 company
 it's
 just
 you
 can't


build
 a
 company
 that
 serves
 the
 world


you
 can
 only
 build
 companies
 that
 serve


very
 particular
 markets
 and
 that
 goes


against
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 internet


so
 this
 is
 why
 I
 think
 again
 Protocols


are
 important
 is
 protocols
 don't
 have
 to


correspond
 to
 these
 regulations
 they're


they're
 not
 owned
 by
 any
 one
 company


they're
 not
 owned
 by
 any
 one
 individual


they're
 Untouchable
 by
 a
 government
 you


look
 at
 Bitcoin
 um
 as
 again
 the
 biggest


scaled
 example
 of
 this
 um
 that's
 how
 you


get
 around
 these
 issues
 and
 uh
 and
 and


to
 me
 that's
 that's
 the
 biggest
 that's


the
 biggest
 concern
 let's
 talk
 about
 um


Bitcoin
 you
 um
 started
 something
 called


block
 tell
 us
 what
 is
 block
 we


originally
 started
 a
 company
 called


Square
 um
 and
 change
 the
 name
 to
 block


because
 we
 have
 multiple
 business


businesses
 now
 and
 if
 you
 make
 a
 square


three-dimensional
 it's
 a
 block
 um
 so


block
 is
 focused
 on
 uh


um
 economic
 empowerment
 building
 tools


to
 empower
 people
 into
 the
 economy
 we


started
 with
 sellers
 so
 enabling
 sellers


to
 accept
 credit
 cards
 was
 our
 beginning


and
 then
 we
 added
 another
 business


called
 Cash
 app
 which
 allows
 people
 to


easily
 move
 money
 between
 two
 people
 or


businesses
 with
 their
 mobile
 phone


instantly
 that
 is
 becoming
 more
 and
 more


a
 bank
 in
 the
 form
 of
 an
 app
 um
 and


today
 uh
 we
 have
 two
 massive
 ecosystems


at
 scale
 square
 and
 cash
 app
 that
 serve


Sellers
 and
 individuals
 and
 uh
 give
 them


very
 simple
 Financial
 tools
 to
 um
 do


things
 that
 they
 want
 to
 do
 do
 in
 the


economy
 or
 let
 you
 send
 money
 to
 their


friends
 and
 family
 or
 get
 a
 debit
 card


um
 go
 to
 an
 ATM
 uh
 set
 up
 a
 e-commerce


shop
 um
 or
 do
 customer
 relationship


management
 when
 do
 you
 think
 these


things
 are
 in
 five
 years
 time
 well
 the


the
 the
 other
 thing
 that


we
 um
 wanted
 to
 do
 is
 like
 our
 business


is
 constrained
 right
 now
 by
 that


fragmented
 regulatory
 environment
 for
 us


to
 launch
 Square
 in
 any
 Market
 or
 for
 us


to
 launch
 cash
 app
 in
 any
 Market
 we
 have


to
 have
 a
 partnership
 with
 a
 local
 bank


we
 have
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 different


regulatory
 um
 approaches
 within
 that


Market
 within
 that
 country
 and
 it's
 a


very
 very
 heavy
 cost
 um
 so
 we
 have
 to


weigh
 that
 cost
 versus
 building
 new


features
 for
 the
 markets
 that
 we're


currently
 in
 and
 what
 allows
 us
 to
 move


faster
 if
 the
 internet
 had
 a
 protocol


for
 moving
 money
 around
 enter
 Bitcoin


Bitcoin
 is
 a
 protocol
 for
 moving
 money


around
 if
 Bitcoin
 is
 used
 not
 just
 as
 a


store
 of
 value
 but
 as
 a
 currency
 to
 move


money
 around
 between
 people
 or
 between


businesses
 and
 people
 or
 businesses
 and


businesses
 as
 that
 becomes
 more
 and
 more


a
 thing
 which
 I
 do
 think
 it
 becomes
 over


the
 next
 five
 years
 then
 we
 can
 launch


up
 we
 can
 launch
 cash
 app
 and
 square
 in


every
 single
 country
 that
 has
 the


internet
 and
 that
 allows
 us
 to
 serve


more
 people
 better
 faster
 um


and
 because
 Bitcoin
 is
 open
 it's
 not


controlled
 by
 one
 company
 it's
 not


controlled
 by
 any
 one
 government
 uh
 it's


completely
 transparent
 people
 can
 see


what
 it
 does
 and
 we
 can
 solve
 all
 the


problems
 that
 we
 would
 task
 with


governments
 and
 uh
 companies
 to
 solve
 um


by
 doing
 it
 transparently
 and
 by
 doing


it
 openly
 um
 because
 again
 it's
 the


internet
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 internet


principles
 so
 I'm
 hoping
 these
 Financial


systems
 take
 on
 more
 internet
 principles


and
 we
 can
 truly
 be
 an
 internet
 company


instead
 of
 going
 Market
 by
 market
 by


market
 which
 is
 just
 a
 really
 slow
 way


to
 build
 for
 the
 world
 you
 can't
 build


for
 the
 world
 you
 can
 only
 build
 for


these
 particular
 markets
 that
 you
 happen


to
 be
 approved
 in
 and
 again
 you're
 you


have
 to
 be
 approved
 by
 another
 company


you
 have
 to
 be
 approved
 by
 um
 by
 these


things
 that
 don't
 have
 your
 interest
 or


even
 their
 customers's
 interest
 at
 heart


so
 what
 needs
 to
 happen
 uh
 for
 Bitcoin


to
 function
 more
 effectively
 I
 think


think
 it
 it's
 happening
 right
 now
 like


more
 and
 more
 people
 see
 that
 it's


valuable
 every
 time
 that
 number
 goes
 up


people
 get
 more
 interested
 in
 it
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 Bitcoin
 and
 its
 final
 stage


is
 just
 a
 store
 of
 value
 but
 I
 think


it's
 a
 necessary
 part
 of
 the
 path
 to
 get


to
 um
 I
 think
 the
 next
 big
 one
 which
 is


remittance
 across
 border
 moving
 money


between
 businesses
 moving
 money
 between


people
 across
 borders
 which
 is
 happening


in
 um
 many
 countries
 outside
 the
 United


States
 and
 Western
 countries
 today


because
 there's
 no
 other
 options
 um
 and


then
 it
 gets
 to


currency
 as
 people
 get
 more
 comfortable


with
 it
 as
 they
 see
 that
 it's
 not
 going


away
 Bitcoin
 is
 over
 close
 to
 16
 years


old
 right
 now
 um
 it's
 never
 gone
 down


it's
 never
 had
 a
 security
 uh
 issue
 it


has
 no
 leader
 it
 has
 a
 completely
 open


road
 map
 and
 it's
 determined
 by
 a


consensus
 development
 model
 these
 are


all
 really
 incredible
 ways
 to
 trust
 as
 a


currency
 um
 so
 as
 it
 becomes
 more


understood
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 it's
 going


to
 last
 I
 think
 people
 will
 trust
 it


more
 and
 more
 as
 like
 oh
 this
 is
 the
 way


I'm
 moving
 money
 to
 my
 family
 now
 and


this
 is
 the
 way
 I'm
 buying
 coffee
 now


and
 this
 is
 the
 way
 I'm
 buying
 computers


or
 whatever
 um
 it's
 a
 deflationary


currency
 so
 it
 doesn't
 encourage


spending
 it
 does
 encourage
 savings
 but
 I


think
 it
 has
 a
 really
 interesting


path
 um
 and
 provides
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 business
 models
 for
 the


internet
 if
 Bitcoin
 existed
 before
 we


started
 Twitter
 we'd
 be
 in
 a
 much


different
 state
 and
 I
 think
 we'd
 be
 in
 a


much
 better
 State
 and
 we
 wouldn't


have
 all
 the
 issues
 that
 you
 see
 with


social
 media
 today
 because
 it's
 not
 a


tax
 on
 the
 system
 it
 allows
 for
 a
 a


business
 model
 that's
 aligned
 with
 the


people
 that
 are
 using
 it
 every
 single


day
 uh
 why
 would
 social
 media
 be
 better


if
 you
 had
 Bitcoin
 because
 you
 you
 could


get
 to
 Commerce
 right
 away
 you
 could
 get


to
 subscription
 right
 away
 you
 didn't


have
 to
 get
 permission
 from
 Visa


Mastercard
 you
 didn't
 have
 to
 wait
 for


the
 security
 of
 such
 uh
 uh
 payments
 on


the
 internet
 um
 by
 virtue
 and
 by
 the


grace
 of
 EA
 MasterCard
 to
 build
 it
 um


it's
 built
 into
 the
 internet
 um
 and
 it


works
 at
 massive
 scale
 so
 if
 we
 had
 that


tool
 and
 we
 had
 Commerce
 at
 that
 scale


um
 we
 could
 build
 a
 pretty
 phenomenal


business
 that's
 like
 all
 all
 communic
 is


exchange
 of
 value
 Commerce
 is
 exchange


of
 value
 if
 you
 pair
 currency
 with


communication
 you
 ease
 Commerce
 and
 you


ease
 um
 buying
 and
 selling
 of
 things
 and


the
 internet
 wants
 to
 create


efficiencies
 there
 but
 the
 biggest


friction
 in
 that
 creation
 of
 efficiency


were
 the
 payment
 networks
 and
 the
 banks


and
 the
 way
 we
 currently
 deal
 with
 with


money
 so
 Bitcoin
 upends
 all
 that
 and


changes
 it
 and
 provides
 a
 completely


different
 path
 which
 is
 in
 my
 view
 far


more
 exciting
 and
 allows
 us
 to
 build
 a


much
 bigger
 business
 more
 valuable


business
 Jack
 what
 are
 the
 implications


for
 uh
 the
 payment
 systems
 and
 um


companies
 like
 MasterCard
 and
 visa
 and


so
 on
 you
 know
 visa
 and
 M
 Visa
 at
 least


like
 started
 in
 a
 very
 unique
 way
 and


I'm
 sure
 you're
 aware
 of
 this
 aware
 of


the
 story
 with
 dhawk
 and
 started
 as
 a


co-op
 and
 it
 kind
 of
 started
 like
 a
 a


protocol
 and
 uh
 little
 by
 little
 we'
 got


more
 and
 more
 corporate
 and
 change
 and
 I


think
 um
 if
 visa
 and
 MasterCard
 were
 to


adopt
 open
 protocols
 for
 moving
 money


around
 the
 internet
 they
 could
 still


build
 a
 really
 phenomenal
 business


because
 these
 Technologies
 are
 hard
 and


when
 you
 build
 on
 protocols
 what
 you're


what
 you're
 what
 people
 value
 is


convenience
 and
 removing
 friction
 and


they'll
 pay
 for
 it
 um
 and
 there's
 much


evidence
 in
 this
 on
 the
 web
 and
 on
 email


um
 and
 we
 can
 do
 it
 with
 uh
 with


payments
 too
 there's
 a
 lot
 built
 on
 top


of
 payments
 and
 built
 on
 top
 of
 money


they
 can
 build
 a
 phenomenal
 business
 P


that
 doesn't
 require
 you
 owning
 the


payment
 Network
 itself
 um
 so
 being
 able


to


um
 see
 beyond
 the
 current
 reality
 and


let
 go
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 have
 a
 common


protocol
 that
 every
 company
 can
 use


increases
 the
 total
 addressable
 Market


it
 increases
 the
 number
 of
 transactions


you
 can
 see
 and
 you
 can
 participate
 in


it
 increases
 the
 number
 of
 people
 who


can
 participate
 and
 if
 you
 have


something
 that's
 creative
 on
 top
 of
 it


you
 you
 build
 a
 phenomenal
 business


that's
 world
 changing
 so
 I
 there's
 so


many
 lessons
 in
 the
 internet
 and
 all


those
 lessons
 have
 to
 do
 with
 open


protocols
 and
 um
 anyone
 who
 ignores


these
 lessons
 I
 think
 is
 not
 long
 for


the
 world
 um
 as
 a
 company
 um
 it's
 just
 a


matter
 of
 time
 the
 internet
 is
 still


very
 very
 very
 young
 but
 it
 will
 uh
 it


will
 teach
 all
 of
 us
 especially
 as
 more


of
 these
 agent
 systems
 come
 out
 and
 we


realize
 that
 like
 these
 agents
 are


working
 on
 our
 behalf
 by
 virtue
 of
 us


having
 a
 highly
 hyperconnected
 internet


that
 they
 can
 roam
 freely
 upon
 and
 if


there's
 any
 friction
 along
 the
 way


they're
 not
 going
 to
 become
 valuable
 I'd


love
 to
 spend
 a
 bit
 of
 time
 on
 being
 an


entrepreneur
 what
 do
 entrepreneurs
 have


in


common
 well
 they're
 all
 different
 they


all
 have
 different
 paths
 um
 I
 think
 like


if
 I
 think
 about
 that
 word
 and
 the
 the


concept
 it's
 um
 my
 experience
 my
 path
 I


never
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 CO
 I
 never
 wanted


to
 build
 to
 company
 I
 never
 wanted
 to
 be


an


entrepreneur
 I
 could
 care
 less
 about
 it


I
 wanted
 to
 build
 I
 wanted
 to
 build
 and


I
 wanted
 to
 be
 you
 I
 wanted
 to
 use
 what


I
 built
 and
 I
 want
 other
 people
 to
 use


what
 I
 built
 and
 I


realized
 somewhere
 along
 the
 way
 that
 in


order
 to
 sustain
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 built


I
 needed
 money
 and
 that's
 where
 building


a
 business
 came
 in
 so
 I
 had
 to
 learn


about
 building
 a
 business
 and
 running
 a


business
 and
 being
 a
 CEO
 but
 the
 spirit


of
 all
 that
 is
 you
 do
 whatever
 it
 takes


to
 make
 it
 work
 I
 learned
 how
 to
 program


because
 I
 needed
 to
 understand
 how
 to


build
 things
 on
 my
 computer
 in
 front
 of


me
 I
 um
 I
 needed
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 be
 a


CEO
 I
 need
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 raise
 money
 I


needed
 to
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 hire
 people


how
 to
 fire
 people
 how
 to
 build
 cultural


Frameworks
 how
 to
 build
 uh
 systems


investment
 Frameworks
 um
 uh
 feedback


mechanisms
 all
 these
 things
 that
 I
 had


no
 desire
 to
 do
 or
 to
 build
 I
 had
 to
 do


and
 learn
 because
 it
 was
 the
 only
 way
 to


take
 the
 idea
 to
 the
 The
 Next
 Step
 it


was
 the
 only
 way
 to
 uh
 enable
 um
 more


and
 more
 people
 to
 use
 the
 thing
 that
 I


wanted
 them
 to
 use
 and
 and
 to
 mature
 it


I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that
 entrepreneurs


are
 a
 bit
 like
 artists
 what
 do
 you
 mean


by
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 expression
 art
 is


expression
 it's
 knowing
 when
 to
 end


something
 it's
 knowing
 you
 know
 what
 the


chapters
 are
 and
 uh
 where
 the
 piece


begins
 and
 where
 it
 ends
 and
 that's
 very


much
 a
 product
 that's
 very
 much
 a


business
 like
 you
 could
 do
 everything


and
 it
 becomes
 this
 mess
 that
 no
 one


knows
 what
 to
 do
 with
 or


you
 draw
 the
 lines
 and
 draw
 the
 the
 box


and
 the
 shape
 and
 the
 inputs
 and
 the


outputs
 and
 suddenly
 becomes
 something


that
 is
 an
 expression
 of
 an
 idea
 that's


successible
 and
 that's
 manageable
 and


someone
 can
 actually
 use
 and


um
 and
 and
 doing
 that
 and
 determining


what
 those
 boundaries
 and
 those
 lines


are
 and
 what
 the
 end
 in
 the
 beginning
 is


is
 very
 very
 challenging
 um
 and
 that


that's
 where
 I
 think
 the
 art
 part
 of
 it


comes
 in


even
 though
 like
 business
 people
 aren't


necessarily
 consider
 that
 the
 the


founding
 of
 a
 company
 the
 founding
 of
 an


idea
 when
 it
 starts
 as
 an
 idea
 not
 I'm


building
 a
 business
 to
 do
 XYZ
 but
 an


idea
 and
 how
 do
 I
 sustain
 the
 idea


that's
 when
 I
 think
 the
 art
 the
 art


comes
 out
 and
 not
 everyone
 starts
 that


way
 there's
 some
 entrepreneurs
 Who
 start


like
 I
 want
 to
 build
 a
 Healthcare


company
 I
 need
 to
 go
 find
 a
 problem
 to


solve
 y
 yada
 yada
 and
 they
 do
 something


interesting
 but
 I
 think
 the
 truth
 truly


interesting
 and
 truly
 world
 changing


things
 are
 more
 ideas
 and
 then
 like
 how


do
 I
 make
 the
 idea
 bigger
 and
 building
 a


business
 around
 it
 uh
 was
 the
 way
 to
 do


that
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 rejection


rejection
 yeah
 well
 I
 uh
 I
 kind
 of
 take


on
 this
 mindset
 that
 everything
 I


encounter
 everything
 I
 experience
 as
 a


teacher
 and
 they
 have
 some
 lesson
 for
 me


and
 it's
 up
 to
 me
 whether
 I
 decide
 to


learn
 from
 it
 or
 not
 and
 then
 there
 is


no
 rejection
 it's
 just
 like
 well
 I


choose
 to
 learn
 from
 this
 or
 I
 don't
 and


if
 I
 don't
 then
 it
 feels
 terrible
 and
 I


it's
 a
 waste
 of
 effort
 and
 I
 feel
 bad
 if


I
 do
 I
 own
 it
 I'm
 better
 because
 of
 it


so
 there's
 no
 rejection
 so
 I
 just
 choose


to
 learn
 from
 every
 single
 person
 that's


put
 in
 front
 of
 me
 every
 single
 mistake


every
 single
 challenge
 every
 single


encounter
 I
 have
 there's
 it's
 a
 teacher


and
 like
 what
 is
 it
 trying
 to
 teach
 me


no
 matter
 how
 small
 or
 how
 big
 it
 is


it's
 trying
 to
 teach
 me
 something
 and
 if


if
 I
 ignore
 it
 um
 or
 if
 I
 decide
 not
 to


learn
 from
 it
 that's
 that's
 the
 that's


the
 reaction
 that's
 that's
 the


diminishing
 thing
 but
 if
 I
 choose
 to


learn
 something
 from
 it
 even
 if
 it's


tiny
 I
 own
 it
 and
 there's
 no
 hard


feelings
 at
 all
 where
 did
 you
 learn


these
 mindsets
 experience
 just
 doing


it
 um
 not
 wanting
 to
 feel
 bad
 um
 I
 took


a
 lot
 of
 meditation
 as
 well
 um
 and
 uh


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 learn
 in
 this


practice
 called
 The
 Impossible
 now
 is


that
 you
 know
 you
 you
 spend
 all
 this


time


observing
 Pleasure
 and
 Pain
 in
 the
 body


and
 You
 observe
 the
 pain
 and
 You
 observe


your
 reaction
 to
 the
 pain
 and
 then
 you


realize
 it's
 a
 reaction
 to
 the
 pain
 and


when
 you
 understand
 that
 and
 you


understand
 that
 the
 pain
 is


temporary
 and
 you're
 having
 this


reaction
 of
 suffering
 over
 something


that's
 temporary
 you're
 like
 what
 am
 I


doing
 I'm
 I'm
 choosing
 to
 suffer
 over


this
 thing
 that
 eventually
 will
 go
 away


um
 so
 I
 can
 change
 the
 reaction
 because


it
 is
 a
 reaction
 I
 I
 get
 to
 decide
 that


reaction
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 physical


this
 meditation
 is
 a
 very
 very
 physical


practice
 and
 it's
 the
 hardest
 thing
 I've


ever
 done
 mentally
 and
 physically


because
 you're
 in
 actual
 real
 physical


pain
 but
 at
 some
 point
 You
 observe
 this


pain
 and
 You
 observe
 your
 reaction
 and


it
 just
 clicks
 and
 the
 pain


dissipates
 it's
 amazing
 and
 um
 how
 often


do
 you
 meditate
 I
 was
 I
 was
 doing
 a


10day
 silent
 Meditation
 Retreat
 every


year
 for
 5
 years
 before
 covid
 and
 then


uh
 I
 I
 there
 was
 10
 days
 of
 like
 you


don't
 speak
 you


don't
 uh
 all
 you
 do
 is
 meditate
 from
 4


in
 the
 morning
 till
 9:00
 p.m
 no
 phone
 no


communication
 no
 exercise
 whatever
 um
 so


during
 Co
 all
 the
 center
 is
 closed
 and
 I


haven't
 gone
 back
 yet
 but
 I
 I
 meditate


every
 day
 for
 like
 an
 hour
 when
 I
 get
 up


or
 attempt
 so
 uh
 pain
 pain
 is
 good


what's
 the
 optimal
 pain
 level
 anything


that
 teaches
 you
 something
 new
 teaches


you
 about
 yourself
 teaches
 you
 about


your
 capabilities
 is
 this
 a
 very
 lonely


journey
 I
 guess
 it
 could
 be
 of
 like
 um


again
 that's
 a
 feeling
 right
 that's
 a


decision
 you
 make
 I
 I
 choose
 to
 be


diminished
 by
 this
 reaction
 to
 um
 being


lonely


or
 what
 is
 this
 experience
 trying
 to


teach
 me
 like
 what
 what
 am
 I
 supposed
 to


learn
 from
 this
 I
 I
 think
 all
 these


things
 are
 ultimately
 decisions
 but
 it


takes
 time
 to
 realize
 that
 and
 it
 takes


time
 to
 hone
 the
 tools
 to
 act
 on
 the


decision
 is
 this
 how
 you
 come
 up
 with


your
 lists
 the
 dos
 and
 the


don'ts
 yeah
 um
 perhaps
 you
 want
 to


explain
 these
 lists
 yeah
 every
 day
 I
 I


write
 down
 what
 I
 want
 to
 accomplish
 and


what
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 um
 I
 think
 we


often
 focus
 on
 what
 you
 do
 want
 to
 do


and
 and
 we
 focus
 on
 these
 very
 large


goals
 and
 if
 I've
 learned
 anything
 it's


to
 make
 the
 goal
 very
 very
 small
 and


repeat
 it
 and
 iterate
 it
 as
 quickly
 as


possible
 so
 you
 see
 momentum
 like
 if
 you


wanted
 to
 meditate
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 people


start
 with
 this
 like
 new
 year's


resolution
 New
 Year's
 is
 coming
 up
 right


New
 Year's
 resolution
 I'm
 going
 to


meditate
 for
 one
 hour
 a
 day
 they
 do
 it


one
 time
 never
 again
 if
 instead
 you
 say


I'm
 I'm
 GNA
 meditate
 for
 a
 minute
 every


single
 day
 for
 two
 weeks
 one
 minute
 I


can
 definitely
 do
 one
 minute
 and
 I
 stick


to
 it
 and
 I
 don't
 go
 past
 one
 minute
 I


do
 only
 one
 minute
 one
 minute
 um
 and


then
 after
 that
 one
 minute
 I
 did
 it
 so


now
 I'm
 going
 to
 move
 it
 to
 5
 minutes


and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 move
 it
 to
 10


minutes
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 move
 it
 to


20
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 move
 it
 to
 an


hour
 and
 that
 progression
 makes
 it
 not


feel
 like
 work
 it
 makes
 it
 feel
 like
 an


understanding
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 getting
 it


and
 um
 so
 it's
 it's
 really
 important
 to


write
 down
 the
 small
 goals
 that
 you
 have


for
 the
 day
 and
 then
 more
 importantly


what
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 because
 we


never
 focus
 on
 like
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do


this
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 get
 distracted
 by


politics
 or
 like
 TV
 or
 whatever
 so
 J


what's
 been
 on
 what's
 been
 on
 your
 list


today
 what's
 been
 your
 to-do
 list
 today


I'm
 learning
 uh
 more
 about
 quantum


physics
 right
 now
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 doing
 some


study
 and
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 want
 to


do
 is
 spend
 like
 again
 I
 move
 from
 like


30
 minutes
 to
 an
 hour
 every
 day
 of


reading
 and
 watching
 videos
 around


quantum
 physics
 and
 um
 I'm
 also
 doing


some
 language
 learning
 I'm
 learning


Italian
 um
 so
 an
 hour
 with
 that
 as
 well


and
 then
 I'm
 doing
 some
 programming


learning
 as
 well
 um
 to
 keep
 my
 skill


High
 uh
 and
 in
 the
 field
 of
 AI
 and


agents
 as
 well
 so
 I
 dedicate
 one
 hour
 to


that
 and
 three
 hours
 of
 learning
 in
 the


morning
 when
 I
 want
 to
 do
 the
 hard
 stuff


so
 that
 the
 rest
 of
 day
 feels
 like
 a
 win


um
 those
 those
 are
 the
 things
 on
 my
 list


and
 what
 is
 on
 your
 don't
 do
 list
 don't


get
 distracted
 by
 the
 news
 cuz
 it's
 kind


of


all
 fog
 of
 War
 right
 now
 um
 don't
 get


distracted
 by
 the
 politics
 don't
 get


distracted
 by
 entertainment
 at
 the


moment
 because
 I
 really
 I
 I
 want
 to


learn
 how
 to
 learn
 better
 I
 want
 to


learn
 how
 to
 learn
 faster
 and
 and
 deeper


so
 I'm
 I'm
 experimenting
 with
 like
 these


three
 different
 subjects
 at
 once
 in


order
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 patterns


are
 in
 my
 own
 learning
 um
 so
 that
 I


can
 uh
 achieve
 like
 some
 novice
 or


Mastery
 skill


and
 multiple
 things
 U
 much
 faster
 uh
 and


what
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 key
 to
 FAL


learning
 observing
 for
 quite
 some
 time


and
 then
 doing
 but
 I
 think
 people
 skip


the
 observing
 phase
 too
 often
 I
 don't


think
 people
 are
 good
 listeners
 I
 don't


think
 people
 have
 H
 in
 their
 ability
 to


observe
 the
 world
 and
 observe
 nature
 and


observe
 how
 things
 work
 um
 and
 I
 think


they
 try
 to
 act
 too


soon
 and
 um
 I
 think
 the
 observation
 part


is
 critical
 and
 I
 think
 it
 mirrors
 what


we
 do
 as
 babies
 as
 we're
 acquiring
 new


skills
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 observing


and
 we're
 just
 inated
 and
 immersed
 in


all
 these
 things
 happening
 around
 us
 and


then
 around
 age
 two
 or
 three
 we
 get
 the


ability
 and
 the
 tools
 to
 do
 but
 it's


come
 from
 a
 place
 of
 massive
 immersion


and
 I
 think
 as
 adults
 we
 skip
 the


immersion
 part
 and
 we
 skip
 the


observation
 part
 and
 we
 try
 to
 do
 and
 it


gets
 to
 the
 thinking
 and
 the
 thinking


removes
 the
 ability
 to
 like
 truly
 act
 in


an
 intuitive
 way
 based
 on
 all
 the


information
 that's
 constantly
 coming


into
 your
 into
 your
 system
 Jak
 why
 do


you
 eat
 only
 once
 a
 day
 I
 I
 like
 to
 uh


back
 to
 learning
 I
 like
 to
 learn
 by


going
 to
 extremes
 so
 I've
 tried
 every


single
 diet
 you
 can
 imagine
 um
 I
 got


very
 interested
 in
 my
 health
 and


maintaining
 my
 health
 span
 and
 uh
 one
 of


the
 things
 someone
 was
 doing
 that
 felt


interesting
 was
 they
 had
 this
 one
 meal
 a


day
 thing
 and
 um
 I
 tried
 it
 and
 I
 only


ate
 dinner
 and
 then
 I
 only
 ate
 breakfast


and
 I
 only
 tried
 lunch
 and
 what
 was


amazing
 is
 like
 I
 got
 all
 this
 time
 back


and
 it
 felt
 like
 a
 superpower
 all
 these


people
 spent
 all
 this
 time
 eating


breakfast
 and
 eating
 lunch
 and
 dinner


and
 all
 this
 ritual
 around
 it
 and
 I
 had


all
 that
 time
 back
 I
 had
 literally
 two


or
 three
 hours
 back
 to
 do
 something
 else


or
 to
 have
 a
 real
 conversation
 that's


not
 interrupted
 by
 food
 and
 then
 uh
 I


realized
 I
 didn't
 need
 that
 much
 food


like
 we're
 we
 overeat
 we
 definitely


overeat
 especially
 in
 the
 United
 States


so
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 like
 what
 needs


are
 and
 what
 desires
 are
 and
 separating


those
 those
 two
 things
 and
 I
 felt
 like


my
 health
 increased
 my
 energy
 increased


and
 I
 gave
 myself
 all
 this
 time
 back
 to


do
 things
 that
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 do
 and


and
 when
 I
 did
 eat
 it
 t
 tasted
 amazing
 I


I
 regained
 taste
 and
 I
 regained


appreciation
 for
 food
 not
 just
 as


entertainment
 but
 as
 like
 sustenance


what
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people
 uh


observe
 observe
 everything
 like
 take


everything
 in
 get
 love
 information
 love


receiving
 information
 don't
 worry
 about


reacting
 to
 it
 don't
 worry
 about


memorizing
 it
 don't
 worry
 about
 doing


anything
 with
 it
 at
 all
 just
 be
 open
 and


when
 you
 need
 to
 do
 something
 with
 it


it'll
 come
 very
 good
 Jack
 it's
 been
 a


it's
 been
 an
 honor
 having
 you
 on
 here


big
 thanks
 for
 sharing
 your
 thoughts


truly
 truly
 fascinating
 thanks
 am


million
 thank
 you
 so
 much
