many
 Anti-Trust
 cases
 against
 the
 most


powerful
 companies
 in
 the
 world


including
 Apple
 Microsoft
 alphabet


Amazon
 meta
 and
 I'm
 sure
 Mara
 that
 all


cosos
 in
 the
 world
 get
 proper
 nerves


when
 your
 name
 shows
 up
 in
 their
 inbox


but
 big
 welcome
 uh
 to
 this
 podcast
 well


thank
 you
 very
 much
 and
 and
 of
 course
 I


hope
 that
 they
 completely
 keep
 their


calm
 because
 they
 like
 competition
 and


they
 know
 that
 they're
 on
 the
 right
 side


of
 competition
 law
 there
 we
 go
 now
 you


have
 a
 very
 long
 title
 what
 is
 your


mandate
 well
 basically
 as
 you
 say
 uh
 I


enforce
 European
 competition
 law
 uh
 but


also
 I
 have
 sort
 of
 a
 coordinating


responsibility
 for
 Europe
 making
 the


best
 use
 of
 digital
 technology
 so
 making


sure
 that
 technology
 serves
 people
 and


uh
 and
 the
 tool
 to
 make
 that
 happen
 is


of
 course
 that
 you
 can
 trust
 technology


what
 is
 the
 aim
 of
 Regulation
 well
 I


think
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 how
 Europe


approaches
 uh
 new
 technology
 we
 are
 tend


to
 be
 more
 risk
 averse
 than
 in
 other


parts
 uh
 of
 on
 other
 parts
 of
 of
 our


planet
 and
 and
 for
 instance
 our
 AI


regulation
 the
 point
 of
 that
 is
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 can
 trust
 uh
 when
 AI
 is


being
 used
 in
 situation
 where
 it
 may
 be


critical
 if
 a
 municipality
 is
 using
 AI


to
 decide
 who
 can
 get
 a
 social
 benefit


then
 you
 really
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that


there
 is
 a
 human
 in
 the
 loop
 and
 that


you
 can
 trust
 the
 AI
 to
 get
 it
 right
 and


this
 is
 not
 Theory
 because
 we've
 had
 the


first
 Scandal
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 piece


of
 legislation
 like
 the
 Digital
 Services


act
 it
 obliges
 uh
 service
 providers
 uh


to
 make
 sure
 that
 their
 services
 are


safe
 that
 for
 instance
 uh
 Instagram


cannot
 provoke
 uh
 mental
 illnesses
 uh


that
 uh
 Tik
 Tok
 or
 Twitter
 cannot
 X


cannot
 be
 used
 to
 undermine
 our


democracy
 and
 the
 D
 markets
 Act
 is
 there


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 market
 is
 open
 and


contestable
 so
 that
 it
 is
 worthwhile
 to


invest
 also
 in
 start
 up
 and
 scale
 up


because
 you
 know
 that
 it
 depends
 on


their
 idea
 their
 work
 ethic
 their


Capital
 their
 product
 it
 doesn't
 depend


on
 some
 gatekeeper
 opening
 the
 gate
 to


the
 market
 or
 not
 so
 with
 these
 three


examples
 I
 try
 to
 show
 that
 uh


regulation
 is
 a
 way
 to
 keep
 the
 market


healthy
 and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh


technology
 actually
 is
 here
 to
 serve
 us


and
 in
 doing
 so
 also
 making
 sure
 that


there
 is
 plenty
 of
 room
 for
 Innovation


so
 we'll
 um
 come
 back
 to
 the
 digital


side
 of
 things
 which
 is
 of
 course
 very


very
 important
 and
 topical
 but
 just
 uh


generally
 how
 do
 you
 balance
 uh


competition
 within
 Europe
 uh
 versus


Europe
 being
 competitive
 globally
 uh


it's
 very
 important
 that
 you
 sort
 of
 uh


exercise
 your
 uh
 competitive
 muscle
 in


your
 home
 Market
 which
 is
 why
 the
 single


Market
 of
 the
 European
 Union
 should
 work


uh
 well
 and
 in
 some
 instances
 better


than
 today
 in
 order
 to
 be
 able
 actually


to
 win
 the
 competition
 outside
 uh
 of
 the


European
 Union
 on
 the
 global
 market
 we


just
 uh
 Revisited
 uh
 a
 merger
 that
 we


prohibited
 five
 six
 years
 ago
 which
 was


the
 merger
 between
 two
 uh
 companies


seamons
 and
 alom
 and
 it
 was
 prohibited


on
 grounds
 of
 signaling
 systems
 and
 very


high
 speed


trains
 uh
 because
 the
 companies
 couldn't


find
 ways
 to
 solve
 the
 competition


problems
 they
 would
 have
 very
 very
 high


market
 shares
 in
 Europe
 and
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 talk
 about
 this
 uh
 that
 the


Chinese
 would
 overtake
 uh
 the
 global


market
 we've
 res
 Revisited
 uh
 the
 market


now
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 the
 Chinese


are
 very
 big
 in
 China
 but
 not
 in
 many
 in


any
 other
 markets
 of
 significance
 two


companies
 in
 particular
 have
 filled


order
 books
 uh
 and
 are
 playing
 uh
 really


well
 and
 those
 two
 companies
 actually


are
 seens
 and
 elom
 uh
 in
 the
 global


Marketplace
 have
 you
 prohibited
 merges


which
 you
 should
 not
 have
 prohibited
 I


don't
 think
 so
 because
 it's
 something


that
 we
 do
 really
 rarely
 and
 we
 do
 it


with
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 restraint
 we
 we
 go
 to


the
 outmost
 efforts
 uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that


businesses
 can
 solve
 the
 competition


concerns
 uh
 that
 we
 may
 have
 because


it's
 not
 for
 us
 to
 decide
 whether


businesses
 should
 merge
 or
 not
 it's
 for


us
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 if
 they
 merge
 uh


follow
 on
 competition
 problems
 should
 be


solved
 so
 only
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 the


businesses
 either
 don't
 want
 to
 or
 do
 or


cannot
 solve
 competition
 problems
 would


we
 take
 a
 step
 to
 a
 Prohibition
 and


which
 of
 the
 ones
 you
 which
 you
 have
 let


through
 should
 you
 have
 stopped
 well


that
 is
 difficult
 to
 say
 uh
 we
 try
 to


revisit
 uh
 what
 we
 uh
 if
 the
 solutions


to
 competition
 problems
 if
 they
 actually


work
 and
 uh
 and
 that's
 a
 very
 difficult


discipline
 because
 it
 may
 be
 that
 we
 say


we
 need
 to
 have
 a
 fix
 it
 first
 we
 need


to
 know
 to
 whom
 you
 want
 to
 divest
 this


business
 where
 you
 have
 an
 overlap
 in
 a


market


where
 you
 would
 have
 a
 maybe
 a
 defao


monopoly
 then
 we
 look
 at
 the
 buyers
 of


this
 divested
 business
 and
 it
 may
 all


look
 fine
 also
 financially
 but
 then


maybe
 two
 years
 down
 the
 road
 three
 four


years
 down
 the
 road
 problems
 arise


markets
 changes
 and
 then
 it
 turns
 out


that
 the
 buyer
 cannot
 make
 it
 that
 of


course
 is
 really
 painful
 uh
 because


customers
 will
 suffer
 from
 this
 uh


workers
 will
 suffer
 from
 this
 but
 it's


also
 very
 very
 difficult
 uh
 to
 predict


whether
 a
 buyer
 years
 down
 the
 road
 will


still
 have
 the
 financial
 capacity
 we


prefer
 a
 a
 buyer
 which
 is
 in
 the
 market


so
 that
 you
 have
 the
 necessary
 knowledge


about
 the
 market
 for
 instance
 if
 it's
 in


chemicals
 uh
 it's
 we
 prefer
 someone


who's
 also
 in
 chemicals
 uh
 to
 buy
 a


divested
 business
 rather
 than
 a
 a


venture
 fund
 uh
 or
 or
 something
 like


that
 in
 order
 for
 someone
 actually
 to
 go


into
 that
 market
 use
 the
 asset
 be
 a


competitive
 force
 uh
 in
 that
 market
 do


you
 think
 um
 where
 we
 are
 now
 that
 there


is
 a
 bigger
 risk
 for
 underregulation
 or


overregulation
 I
 think
 the
 risk
 is
 that


uh


regulation
 sometimes
 is
 made
 uh
 quite


fast
 and
 that
 is
 not
 implemented
 in
 full


so
 it's
 better
 to
 have
 a
 thorough


thoughtful
 legislative
 process
 and


Implement
 Ino
 than
 rushing
 to
 something


because
 you
 think
 you
 have
 a
 need
 here


and
 now
 uh
 even
 if
 you
 think
 that
 you


have
 a
 need
 here
 and
 now
 the
 key
 for


good
 legislation
 is
 that
 it's
 fully


implemented
 and
 that
 you
 have
 resources


to
 fully
 implement
 it
 when
 I
 talk
 about


thoughtful
 regulation
 it
 is
 regulation


where
 you
 have
 time
 to
 take
 views
 on


board
 views
 of
 of
 Industry
 views
 of
 ngos


views
 of
 uh
 of
 those
 who
 who
 take
 an


interest
 other
 Regulators
 because
 then


you
 will
 have
 a
 much
 higher
 probability


of
 making
 a
 piece
 of
 legislation
 where


you're
 solving
 a
 legitimate
 proven


problem
 in
 in
 the
 lightest
 possible


manner
 uh
 because
 we
 have
 I
 think
 quite


a
 heavy
 uh
 regul
 bureaucratic
 burden
 uh


on
 some
 sectors
 where
 where
 businesses


find
 that
 well
 of
 course
 fine
 sure
 we'll


do
 this
 but
 couldn't
 that
 have
 been
 done


in
 a
 in
 a
 lighter
 manner
 but
 do
 you
 um


do
 you
 coordinate
 uh
 your
 work
 with
 um


with
 the
 industrial
 policy
 do
 you
 ever


sit
 down
 and
 think
 you
 know
 what
 we
 need


a
 bigger
 champion
 in
 in
 this
 industry
 or


that
 industry
 in
 order
 to
 compete
 with


America
 China
 and
 so
 on
 I
 think
 the
 best


example
 of
 of
 a
 pro
 competitive
 merger


is
 the
 the
 creation
 of
 of
 Airbus
 it
 goes


back
 many
 years
 by
 now
 had
 that
 not


happened
 uh
 there
 would
 only
 have
 been


one
 producer
 widebody
 uh


airplanes
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very
 good


example
 where
 you
 have
 a
 market


situation
 that
 is
 really
 unbalanced
 and


where
 you
 can
 do
 something
 by
 combining


businesses
 then
 then
 become
 able
 to


scale
 I
 would
 hope
 that
 the
 next


commission
 would
 have
 uh
 a
 thorough
 look


at
 the
 defense
 industry
 since
 uh
 defense


budgets
 are
 increasing
 and
 we
 spent
 most


of
 that
 today
 outside
 of
 Europe
 there
 is


indeed
 room
 for
 consolidation
 of
 a


European
 Defense
 industry
 in
 order
 to
 be


more
 competitive
 towards
 competitors


outside
 of
 Europe
 I
 think
 that's
 that's


an
 obvious
 example
 uh
 a
 third
 uh


approach
 to
 that
 would
 be
 to
 look
 at
 the


the
 single
 Market
 to
 make
 it
 work
 in


full
 we
 still
 have
 markets
 where
 uh


their
 National
 characteristics
 are
 much


more
 obvious
 than
 than
 in
 European


Dimension
 we
 really
 miss
 a
 European


Capital
 Market
 we
 really
 miss
 a
 European


Telco
 market
 and
 that
 of
 course
 makes


consolidation
 more
 tricky
 because
 then


it's
 more
 difficult
 to
 harvest


deficiencies
 in
 in
 what
 would
 be


crossborder
 mergers
 where
 a
 true


European
 single
 Market
 uh
 would
 be
 a


much
 better
 sort
 of
 fertile
 ground
 uh
 to


to
 exercise
 your
 competitive
 uh
 muscle


and
 uh
 and
 be
 better
 to
 scale
 also


outside
 of
 Europe
 you
 say
 we
 lack
 a


European
 Telo
 Market
 but
 isn't
 that


because
 of
 you
 no
 in
 America
 we
 have
 uh


three
 operators
 in
 Europe
 we
 have
 three


in
 each
 country
 right
 so
 we
 have
 a
 total


of
 30
 they're
 all
 tiny
 well
 uh
 and
 not


doing
 that
 well
 no
 it's
 not
 because
 of


me
 um
 it's
 because
 of
 Market
 structure


uh
 I
 think
 the
 four
 biggest
 uh
 operators


in
 Europe
 they
 they
 organize
 about
 60%


of
 all
 customers
 so
 it's
 it's
 not
 that


we
 have
 uh
 a
 a
 situation
 that
 is
 that


much
 difficult
 different
 from
 from
 the


US
 the
 difference
 is
 that
 for
 the


businesses
 who
 are
 in
 more
 than
 one


country
 they
 are
 still
 having
 to
 look
 at


National
 characteristics
 we
 do
 not
 even


have
 a
 European
 prefix
 there
 are


differences
 in
 regulation
 there
 are


differences
 in
 how
 things
 are
 done
 by


national
 regulator
 so
 what
 we
 need
 is
 a


is
 is
 a
 true
 European
 market
 for
 Telco


and
 then
 I
 think
 we
 would
 uh
 have
 bigger


Telco
 businesses
 because
 then
 would
 they


would
 grow
 also
 organically
 uh
 within


that
 market
 moving
 a
 bit
 um
 and
 spending


um
 some
 time
 on
 technology
 which
 of


course
 is
 uh
 extremely
 topical
 now
 um


Sam
 ultman
 of
 open
 Ai
 and
 Dario
 amod
 of


entropic
 say
 that
 they
 they
 don't
 fully


understand
 how
 the
 advanced
 AI
 models


work
 now
 how
 can
 you
 guys
 understand
 it


but
 we
 don't
 try
 because
 it's
 uh
 I
 think


it's
 uh
 overly
 ambitious
 uh
 to
 try
 to


regulate
 technology
 uh
 what
 we
 occupy


ourselves
 with
 is
 to
 look
 at
 the
 use
 of


Technology
 because
 it's
 in
 the
 use
 cases


that
 you
 see
 that
 hum
 may
 be
 squeezed


discriminated
 uh
 not
 seen
 as
 who
 they


are
 uh
 so
 if
 the
 algorithm
 uh
 the
 AI


algorithm
 is
 Generation
 1
 2
 3
 4
 well


that
 may
 be
 for
 the
 developers
 to
 figure


out
 how
 to
 work
 with
 transparency
 and


explainability
 for
 for
 instance
 a
 a
 um
 a


health
 um
 uh
 system
 in
 in
 a
 member
 state


to
 use
 artificial
 intelligence
 as
 a


supportive
 uh
 technology
 to
 the
 doctors


making
 decisions
 about
 diagnosis
 and


treatment
 is
 it's
 really
 important
 for


them
 to
 know
 that
 when
 they
 use
 that
 the


algorithm
 will
 actually
 recognize
 syst


symptoms
 both
 in
 a
 man
 and
 in
 a
 woman
 so


we
 are
 looking
 at
 that
 use
 case
 and
 sort


of
 uh
 making
 sure
 that
 those
 who
 are


responsible
 for
 the
 use
 case
 know
 what


they
 are
 doing
 and
 for
 that
 then
 to


filter
 back
 to
 Developers
 so
 say
 okay
 I


would
 I
 would
 want
 to
 have
 my
 share
 of


the
 European
 health
 market
 so
 I
 should


make
 sure
 that
 my
 AI
 uh
 algorithm
 uh


would
 have
 the
 features
 that
 you
 can


safely
 put
 that
 into
 use
 without
 risking


uh
 in
 this
 example
 half
 of
 the


population
 because
 you
 do
 not
 uh


recognize
 the
 symptoms
 in
 a
 woman
 uh
 of


a
 heart
 attack
 for
 instance
 what
 are
 the


complexities
 in
 the
 European
 digital


markets
 act
 which
 you
 haven't
 seen


before
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 like
 it's


taken
 complexity
 to
 a
 new
 level
 here
 I


think
 that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 are
 uh


difficult
 also
 for
 the
 businesses
 in


scope
 is
 the
 the
 very
 sort
 of


politicized
 debate
 around
 the
 digal


services
 act
 so
 the
 D
 services
 act
 do


not
 regulate
 content
 there's
 no
 European


legislation
 saying
 you
 can
 say
 this
 but


not
 that
 it
 all
 uh
 relates
 with
 national


legislation
 on
 content


in
 most
 countries
 hate
 speech
 is


forbidden
 it's
 forbidden
 to
 excite
 to


violence
 it's
 forbidden
 to
 recruit
 to


terrorism
 uh
 is
 forbidden
 to
 to
 of


course
 abuse
 children
 but
 also
 to
 to


exchange
 uh
 photographs
 of
 uh
 of


children
 that
 are
 being
 abused
 what
 the


D
 services
 Act
 is
 doing
 at
 the
 European


level
 is
 to
 say
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a


system
 so
 that
 you
 can
 filter
 out
 things


that
 are
 illegal
 in
 the
 member
 states


where
 you
 do
 your
 business
 and
 in
 that


system
 you
 also
 need
 to
 tell
 people
 your


content
 has
 been
 filtered
 out
 so
 that


they
 can
 complain
 about
 it
 that's
 the


first
 obligation
 the
 second
 obligation


is
 to
 do
 a
 horizontal
 risk
 assessment
 to


say
 could
 my
 services
 be
 damaging
 for


instance
 to
 mental
 health
 because
 they


have
 an
 addictive


design
 uh
 we
 just
 had
 a
 a
 a
 case
 with
 um


Tik
 Tok
 uh
 who
 wanted
 to
 launch
 a
 new


product
 that
 would
 give
 you
 points
 when


you're
 interacted
 with
 content
 so
 if
 you


like
 the
 video
 if
 you
 saw
 it
 all
 to
 the


end
 if
 you
 shared
 it
 if
 you
 comment
 it


you
 would
 get
 points
 and
 you
 could
 use


those
 points
 for


e-commerce
 so
 you
 basically
 get
 a


voucher
 and
 um
 and
 we
 could
 not
 get
 any


kind
 of
 certainty
 that
 they
 had
 assess


whether
 this
 design
 who
 might
 be


extremely
 addictive
 whether
 that
 was
 the


case
 and
 if
 they
 had
 mitigated
 those


risks
 and
 it
 ended
 up
 that
 they
 would


not
 launch
 this
 product
 uh
 in
 Europe


because
 they
 could
 not
 certify
 that
 they


had
 actually
 done
 their
 homework
 to
 make


sure
 that
 this
 was
 a
 safe
 product
 to
 use


how
 is
 it
 to
 work
 with
 these
 big
 tech


companies
 well
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 I
 mean


how
 how
 forthcoming
 are
 they
 and
 how


willing
 are
 they
 to
 engage
 in
 a


conversation
 with
 you
 when
 you
 when
 you


call
 they're
 very
 different
 they
 have


very
 different


cultures
 uh
 the
 first
 time
 I
 I
 was
 ever


in
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 in
 Pao
 Alto
 was
 was


quite
 recently
 I
 went
 because
 I
 had
 a


speaking
 obligation
 and
 um
 and
 then
 I


visited
 Apple
 and
 Google
 and
 uh
 and


apple
 they
 live
 in
 this
 uh
 building


gated
 uh
 building
 of
 Steel
 and
 and
 sort


of
 pale
 light
 marble
 a
 perfect
 um
 is
 not


a
 circle
 it's
 an
 oval
 I
 think
 Google
 uh


they
 live
 of
 course
 they
 have
 security


but


ungated
 in
 a
 very
 Co
 colorful
 sort
 of
 uh


low
 barrier
 uh


environment
 uh
 that
 seems
 to
 have
 grown


as
 the
 business
 has
 grown
 and
 and
 you


know
 just
 by
 by
 how
 they
 present


themselves
 in
 their
 architecture
 I
 think


tells
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 company
 culture
 so


who
 is
 the
 most
 difficult
 to
 work
 with


well
 they
 have
 their
 own
 difficulties
 uh


and
 of
 course
 their
 own
 uh
 charms
 as


well
 uh
 as
 as
 you
 can
 hear
 uh
 the


building
 uh
 of
 the
 Apple
 headquarter


also
 reflects
 that
 you
 are
 a
 a
 wall


Garden
 from
 the
 the
 gadget
 the
 phone


itself
 to
 the
 operating
 system
 uh
 to
 to


the
 different
 apps
 where
 the
 Google


environment
 is
 much
 more
 open
 you
 know


there's
 no
 it's
 not
 a
 Google
 phone
 it


may
 be
 a
 Samsung
 phone
 with
 an
 an


Android
 operating
 system
 so
 so
 you
 see


that
 those
 differences
 uh
 in
 also
 how


they
 approach
 uh
 Regulators
 should
 the


big
 uh
 tech
 companies
 be
 broken
 up
 well


uh
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 a
 a
 measure
 of


of
 last
 resource
 thought
 uh
 anything
 you


can
 do
 before
 you
 get
 to
 that
 to
 solve
 a


problem
 should
 be


done
 uh
 right
 now
 we
 have
 a
 Google
 case


con
 concerning
 uh
 advertising
 the
 very


short
 uh
 non-technical
 version
 is
 that


Google
 owns
 the
 marketplace
 where
 those


who
 buy
 uh
 ads
 and
 those
 who
 sells
 uh


ads
 um
 uh
 placing
 uh
 they
 meet
 but
 they


also
 own
 the
 ones
 who
 buys
 um
 placing


and
 the
 ones
 who
 sells
 at
 placing
 so
 if


you
 own
 the
 buyer
 the
 seller
 and
 the


marketplace
 well
 then
 you
 have
 a


conflict
 of
 interest
 and
 and
 here
 you


know
 when
 we
 sent
 the
 the
 statement
 of


objection
 we
 said
 we
 have
 huge


difficulties
 in
 seeing
 how
 that
 conflict


of
 interest
 can
 be
 solved
 without
 uh


part
 of
 this
 uh
 being
 governed
 by
 a


third
 party
 so
 a
 breakup
 of
 this


specific
 part
 of
 uh
 of
 the
 Google


ecosystem
 uh
 of
 course
 we're
 all
 ears
 if


it
 can
 be
 done
 uh
 differently
 because
 as


said
 we
 have
 the
 competence
 to
 ask
 for
 a


breakup
 of
 a
 company
 but
 it
 would
 be
 a


meure
 of
 L
 Resort
 do
 you
 um
 coordinate


your
 work
 with
 um
 the
 US
 chair
 of
 the


Federal
 Trade
 Commission
 on
 specific


cases
 when
 we
 have
 the
 waivers
 from


companies
 so
 that
 we
 can
 talk
 uh
 we
 do


yes
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 we
 also
 have
 sort
 of
 a


more
 highlevel
 discussion
 about
 uh
 how


things
 are
 developing
 it's
 like
 a


sipling
 to
 what
 was
 created
 in
 this


mandate
 the
 trade
 and
 Technology
 Council


uh
 I
 had
 it
 with
 my
 colleague
 v
 d
 Broski


on
 our
 side
 on
 the
 US
 side
 is
 Blink
 and


rimond
 and
 Tai
 who
 who
 headset
 this


trade
 technology
 C
 has
 a
 sipling
 which


is
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 structured
 dialogue
 uh


between
 the
 FDC
 the
 doj
 and
 us
 uh
 it


takes
 place
 once
 a
 year
 and
 and
 we


discuss
 development
 in
 technology
 in
 in


markets
 uh
 in
 how
 we
 use
 our
 our
 tools


and
 a
 specific
 spefic
 example
 would
 be


the
 the
 very
 recent
 sort
 of
 common


communication
 between
 the
 FTC
 the
 doj
 US


and
 actually
 also
 the
 CMA
 of
 the
 UK


about
 how
 we
 will
 work
 together
 and


approach
 the
 question
 of
 how
 AI
 will


affect
 uh
 the


marketplace
 uh
 because
 we
 saw
 how
 market


dynamics
 they
 accelerated
 with
 sort
 of


the
 first
 big
 chapter
 of


digitization
 and
 and
 our
 Theory
 or
 or


idea
 is
 that
 that
 acceleration
 of
 Market


development
 may
 actually
 increase
 uh


with
 AI
 when
 it
 gets
 more
 and
 more


embedded
 uh
 in
 businesses
 and
 in
 the


business
 models
 so
 when
 the
 companies


say
 that
 uh
 hey
 uh
 there
 is
 too
 much


regulation
 in
 Europe
 and
 it's
 too


complicated
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 launch


more
 products
 uh
 you
 will
 have
 less


availability
 and
 so
 on
 is
 that
 a
 is
 that


a
 credible
 threat
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


really
 important
 discussion
 because
 it


it
 points
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 need
 to
 do


more
 to
 increase
 European


competitiveness
 as
 such
 and
 here
 you


know
 uh
 competition
 is
 a
 necessary


ingredients
 but
 it's
 not
 enough
 and
 it's


it's
 a
 tricky
 thing
 because
 we
 have


shown
 to
 solve
 crisises
 that
 are


questions
 of
 life
 and
 death
 in
 our
 face


really
 fastpaced
 crisises
 pandemic
 War


uh
 energy
 crisis
 uh
 inflation
 Europe
 has


come


together
 now
 the
 crisis
 of
 uh
 com
 U


competitiv


is
 a
 slow
 one
 competitiveness
 being


eroded
 over
 years
 it
 will
 take
 time
 to


to
 rebuild
 because
 it's
 a
 question
 of


Market
 access
 safe
 Supply
 chains
 um
 easy


permitting
 um
 uh
 authorities
 who
 are
 um


fast
 in
 in
 what
 they
 do
 uh
 access
 to


research
 and
 Innovation
 uh


organizations
 um
 and
 of
 course
 uh
 better


access
 to
 Capital
 but
 M
 do
 you
 do
 you


improve
 competitiveness
 by
 regulating


more
 uh
 no
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 but


sometimes
 uh
 for
 instance
 if
 you
 look
 at


at


biotech
 uh
 Europe
 Prides
 itself
 in


having
 some
 very
 important
 biotech


environments
 in
 Denmark
 in
 in
 Belgium
 in


in
 France
 um
 Cutting
 Edge
 front
 end
 it's


a
 uh
 factor
 of
 competitiveness
 the
 time


from
 Innovation
 uh
 to
 Market
 and
 in


order
 to
 speed
 that
 up
 uh
 I
 think
 it's


necessary
 to
 do
 a
 biotech
 act
 uh
 in
 this


coming
 mandate
 because
 sometimes
 biotech


sort
 of
 falls
 into
 sort
 of
 an
 old
 school


thinking
 about
 how
 to
 regulate
 a


chemical
 a
 novel
 chemical
 that
 needs
 to


get
 to
 Market
 and
 biotech
 is
 is
 specific


it
 has
 its
 specific
 uh
 characteristics


uh
 it
 works
 very
 differently
 from
 from
 a


sort
 of
 a
 more
 old
 school
 chemical
 so


here
 you
 know
 the
 regulation
 comes
 into


place
 actually
 to
 make
 it
 faster
 and


easier
 year
 to
 get
 to
 Market
 not
 to
 make


more
 barriers
 but
 the
 regulation
 is


needed
 because
 otherwise
 you
 would
 be


caught
 up
 in
 in
 other
 pieces
 of


legislation
 that
 would
 then
 make
 things


more
 difficult
 but
 um
 so
 some
 um
 uh


American
 investors
 such
 as
 Mark
 andron


and
 so
 on
 have
 said
 that
 listen
 we
 need


to
 build
 we
 need
 to
 stuff
 AI
 into


everything
 we
 do
 in
 order
 to
 beat
 the


Chinese
 right
 we
 need
 to
 stuff
 it
 into


weapons
 cars
 uh
 you
 know
 farma
 research


all
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 so
 by
 by


regulating
 AI
 a
 lot
 are
 we
 are
 we


holding
 back
 uh
 the
 European


competitiveness
 versus
 America
 and
 China


well
 uh
 the
 the
 regulation
 that
 we
 have


do
 not
 regulate
 uh
 research
 uh
 in
 AI
 or


based
 on
 AI
 at
 all
 it's
 hands
 off
 full


stop
 there's
 no


regulation
 um
 it
 doesn't
 say
 that
 you


cannot
 do
 this
 you
 cannot
 do
 that
 what


it
 says
 is
 that
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 situation


where
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 risk
 of
 people
 being


discriminated
 then
 you
 have
 to
 take


certain


measures
 so
 basically
 you
 can
 do
 so
 so


so
 many
 things
 it
 is
 when
 it
 comes
 to


the
 use
 cases
 so
 the
 market
 creation


that
 the
 AI
 regulation
 really
 touches


you
 and
 and
 looking
 at
 Europe
 if
 you
 say


Okay
 I
 want
 to
 prove
 my
 algorithm
 in
 my


home
 Market
 uh
 before
 I
 I
 really
 uh
 can


can
 go
 in
 for
 in
 in
 the
 Global
 Market


then
 for
 instance
 the
 European
 welfare


states
 is
 an
 obvious
 place
 for
 a
 market


creation
 for
 trustworthy
 AI
 that
 you
 can


use
 AI
 in
 in
 Health
 Systems
 in
 Social


systems
 in
 Educational
 Systems
 because


you
 can
 trust
 it
 you
 can
 also
 say
 well


listen
 look
 at
 us
 we
 can
 do
 this
 people


trust
 what
 we
 do
 with
 AI
 that
 will
 be
 a


market


creating
 um
 approach
 to
 the
 use
 of
 AI


that
 I
 think
 will
 will
 be
 reflected
 in


also
 a
 very
 strong
 selling
 point
 uh


outside
 of
 Europe
 because
 who
 wants
 to


use
 an
 AI
 where
 there
 is
 a
 risk
 of
 your


citizens
 being


discriminated
 well
 for
 sure
 some
 big
 uh


big
 questions
 in
 the
 tech
 sector
 here
 uh


let's
 move
 on
 to
 something
 slightly


easier
 banking
 sector
 now
 one
 of
 the


trade-offs
 between
 having
 a
 competitive


internal
 Market
 with
 many
 banks
 in
 one


country
 or
 building
 up
 a
 bit
 more
 kind


of
 global
 Champions
 well
 I
 think
 it's


very
 important
 to
 have
 uh
 both
 uh
 there


are
 different
 uh
 customer
 uh


preferences
 um
 it
 would
 be
 much
 better


for
 Europe
 if
 we
 had
 one
 European


Capital
 Market
 uh
 it
 would
 also
 make
 it


much
 easier
 for
 banks
 to
 to
 consolidate


uh
 where
 we
 now
 think
 about
 that
 uh


cross
 border
 because
 then
 it
 would
 be


easier
 to
 harest
 uh
 efficiencies
 uh
 uh


and
 making
 sure
 that
 it
 would
 be


actually
 beneficial
 for
 you
 uh
 to
 be
 in


more
 countries
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 push


still
 for
 for
 the
 Capital
 Market
 to
 work


and
 it's
 very
 much
 a
 push
 towards
 member


states
 uh
 to
 take
 down
 in
 full
 that's
 a


European
 um
 uh
 legislation
 European


enforcement
 should
 take
 the
 place
 of


national
 legislation
 and
 National


enforcement
 because
 then
 you
 get
 a
 full


working
 single
 Market
 uh
 also
 for
 for


Bank


because
 for
 for
 big
 business
 uh
 for
 some


of
 the
 huge
 conglomerates
 in
 order
 for


them
 to
 be
 relevant
 to
 work
 with
 a


European
 Bank
 of
 course
 you
 need
 size
 uh


you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 scale
 you
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 get
 uh
 Global
 Services
 so
 uh


I
 really
 hope
 that
 we
 can
 do
 this
 push


um
 uh
 the
 there
 is
 a
 test
 inspired
 by


enri
 Keta
 in
 his
 report
 on
 the
 single


Market
 to
 sort
 of
 push
 for
 a
 a
 fully


working
 Capital
 Market
 by
 by
 looking
 at


savings
 and


Investments
 uh
 I
 think
 both
 approaches


are
 are
 good
 uh
 the
 important
 thing
 is


of
 course
 that
 we
 continue
 taking
 down


the


barriers
 uh
 that
 disable
 a
 fully


functioning
 uh
 single
 Market
 uh
 also


when
 it
 comes
 to
 banking
 services


because
 that
 would
 be
 that
 would
 give
 uh


greater
 scaling
 opportunities
 but
 is
 it


a
 matter
 of
 having
 a
 single
 uh
 kind
 of


Capital
 Market
 because
 in
 banking
 it


seems
 like
 one
 Bank
 needs
 to
 go
 bankrupt


before
 it
 can
 be
 taken
 over
 by
 somebody


else
 right
 like
 we
 saw
 in
 Switzerland


credit
 s
 bank
 basically
 went
 bur
 before


UBS
 can
 could
 buy
 it
 so
 the
 biggest


European
 bank
 now
 is
 I
 think
 number
 20


worldwide
 you
 know
 we
 basically
 don't


have
 any
 Champions
 we've
 not
 assessed
 uh


Bank
 mergers
 uh
 that
 I
 can


remember
 uh
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 is
 the
 the


recovery
 uh
 of
 a
 banking
 sector
 which


was
 very
 heavily
 hit
 uh
 by
 the
 financial


CR


uh
 I
 think
 to
 some
 degree
 uh
 challenged


by


digitization
 and
 getting
 their
 customers


used
 uh
 to
 do
 uh
 all
 their
 banking
 uh


digitally
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 may
 be
 one


of
 the
 factors
 uh
 holding
 back
 that
 it


has
 taken
 longer
 in
 Europe
 to
 uh
 recover


from
 the
 financial
 crisis
 uh
 than
 for


instance
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 after
 the


Ukrainian
 situation
 we
 um
 had
 uh
 a
 guess


Supply
 issue
 in
 in
 Europe
 with
 uh
 with


gas
 prom
 um
 how
 do
 you
 assess
 why
 we


ended
 up
 in
 a
 situation
 like
 that
 which


was
 so
 concentrated
 on
 the
 supply
 side


because
 it
 was


cheap
 uh
 we
 wanted
 that
 cheap
 energy
 uh


because
 for
 for
 obvious
 reasons
 that


works
 very
 well
 uh
 as
 an
 input
 uh
 to


your


industry
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 didn't


realize
 that
 there
 was
 the
 price
 to
 pay


uh
 to
 get
 cheap
 energy
 and
 the
 price


that
 we
 paid
 was
 uh
 our
 security
 and
 our


the
 security
 of
 our


neighbors
 um
 so
 I
 think
 that
 it
 was
 a


unfortunate
 um
 but
 seemingly
 necessary


wakeup
 call
 that
 we
 need
 to
 assess
 the


full


price
 uh
 of
 our
 uh
 supplies
 uh
 to
 have


you
 know
 an
 open
 transparent
 assessment


that
 if
 we
 want
 things
 cheap
 if
 there
 is


a
 security
 premium
 uh
 to
 be
 paid
 now
 we


have
 uh
 Diversified
 uh
 the
 gas
 supply


both
 pipeline
 gas
 and
 LG
 and
 the
 LG


infrastructure
 has
 been
 built
 up
 uh
 very


very
 fast
 so
 we
 have
 I
 think
 10
 12
 uh


Prime
 uh
 suppliers
 to
 rely
 on
 and
 that's


a
 much
 more
 healthy
 structure
 uh
 than


what
 we
 had
 before
 that
 has
 happened


within
 few
 years
 uh
 because
 obviously


gas
 is
 a
 is
 a
 crucial
 energy
 energy


input
 uh
 and
 will
 remain
 so
 for
 a
 number


of
 years
 it's
 lower
 in
 in
 carbon
 than
 uh


than
 than
 oil
 and
 and
 coal
 uh
 so
 it's
 a


good
 transition
 uh
 fuel
 for
 for
 a
 number


of
 reasons
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 good


example
 of
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 when
 faced


with
 an
 urgent
 crisis
 Europe
 can
 move


fast
 uh
 as
 it
 has
 been
 done
 in
 this


situation
 is
 there
 a
 chance
 that
 we


could
 end
 up
 in
 a
 similar
 situation
 with


uh
 with
 batteries
 or
 solar
 panels
 given


that
 we
 are
 now
 so
 dependent
 on
 China


that
 is
 a
 that's
 a
 huge
 risk
 uh
 I
 do


hope
 that
 we
 will
 uh
 learn
 from
 uh
 from


what
 we
 see
 as
 the
 Chinese
 Playbook
 on


on
 how
 the
 solar
 panel
 industry
 was
 de


facto
 moved
 to
 China
 uh
 within
 a


relatively
 short
 time
 frame
 starting


with
 joint
 ventures
 uh
 in
 in
 in
 China


joint
 ventures
 taking
 over
 by
 China
 the


Chinese
 market
 closing
 uh
 the
 Chinese


market
 working
 as
 a
 as
 a
 building
 ground


uh
 for
 a
 solar
 panel
 industry
 now
 with
 a


huge
 uh
 production
 at
 very
 low
 cost


making
 it
 very
 difficult
 if
 not


impossible
 for
 European
 producers
 to
 be


uh


competitive
 and
 uh
 we
 should
 make
 sure


that
 this
 does
 not
 happen
 uh
 if
 you
 look


for
 instance
 at
 our
 wind
 industry
 very


important
 uh
 European
 uh
 wind
 uh


producers
 who
 are
 faced
 with
 Fierce


competition
 by
 the
 Chinese
 uh
 um
 using


more
 or
 less
 uh
 the
 same
 Playbook
 but


luckily
 not
 so
 advanced
 yet
 so
 I
 think


that
 will
 be
 a
 very
 important
 uh
 area
 of


concern
 uh
 you
 might
 know
 that
 we
 have


something
 called
 the
 foreign
 subsidies


regulation
 so
 uh
 we
 can
 look
 for


instance
 at
 uh
 tendering
 if
 we
 fear
 that


there
 has
 been
 Foul
 Play
 so
 it's
 not
 a


competitive
 tender
 but
 it's
 a
 tender


based
 on
 subsidies
 from
 third
 countries


then
 we
 can
 investigate
 and
 we're
 doing


that
 right
 now
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 might


be
 an
 effective
 way
 of
 making
 sure
 that


uh
 unfair
 competition
 do
 not
 uh
 take
 a


hold
 it's
 been
 a
 massive
 change
 in
 the


geopolitical
 situation
 since
 you
 took


over
 this
 job
 how
 um
 how
 has
 it
 changed


the
 way
 you
 have
 to
 think
 um
 if
 you
 I


should
 give
 one
 example
 we
 we
 made
 in


the
 last
 year
 of
 the
 Yonka
 commission
 so


six
 years
 ago
 a
 a
 China
 strategy
 uh
 with


three
 different
 elements
 so
 partnership


on
 uh
 fighting
 climate
 change
 uh


competition
 on
 economic
 matters
 rivalry


uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 uh
 the
 governing


system
 we
 are
 democracy
 we
 do
 not


consider
 them
 a


democracy
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 over
 the


last
 year
 is
 that
 two
 of
 the
 legs
 have


grown
 very
 much
 together
 uh
 economic


competition
 and
 systemic
 rivalry
 which


has
 made
 us
 be
 much
 more
 focusing
 on


economic
 security
 which
 is
 sort
 of
 the


answer
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 systemic
 rival


an
 economic
 competition
 uh
 becomes
 two


sides
 of
 the
 same
 coin
 and
 for
 Economic


Security
 uh
 it
 is
 it's
 a
 very
 U
 broad


effort
 it's
 about
 export
 controls
 but


it's
 also
 about
 our
 research
 and


Innovation
 organizations
 do
 they
 do
 the


due
 diligence
 uh
 to
 know
 if
 students
 uh


PhD
 students
 if
 they
 are
 who
 they
 say


they
 are
 and
 if
 they
 come
 here
 for
 the


right
 reasons
 or
 if
 they
 de
 facto
 comes


here
 to
 do
 what
 you
 could
 call
 sort
 of


industrial
 espion
 or
 research
 uh


Espionage
 so
 it's
 um
 it's
 a
 far-reaching


effort
 uh
 especially
 in
 uh
 in
 a
 number


of
 uh
 of
 critical
 uh


Technologies
 uh
 you
 know
 AI
 uh


semiconductors
 um
 uh


biotech
 uh
 a
 number
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 sectors


uh
 actually
 and
 that
 is
 I
 think
 a
 very


prudent
 answer
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 the


geopolitics
 have
 become
 much
 more


hostile
 than
 what
 they
 were
 10
 years
 ago


do
 you
 mind
 if
 I
 ask
 you
 a
 personal


question
 because
 you
 are
 standing
 in
 the


middle
 of
 these
 massive
 decisions
 with


the
 most
 powerful
 companies
 in
 the
 world


uh
 trying
 to
 uh
 convince
 you
 in
 all


different
 types
 of
 directions
 how
 does


it
 feel
 to
 to
 be
 the
 the
 head
 of
 this


well
 I
 I
 think
 it
 would


be
 very
 lonely
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 for
 the


amazing
 people
 that
 I
 work


with
 and
 it
 it
 would
 it
 will
 feel
 maybe


also
 a
 bit
 in
 vain
 if
 I
 didn't
 look
 at


the
 people
 that
 we


serve
 um
 sometimes
 you
 know
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 a


meeting
 and
 and
 the
 person
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 table
 makes
 I
 don't
 know
 how


many
 times
 more
 uh
 than
 I
 would
 ever
 do


uh
 and
 his
 business
 may
 have
 a
 turnover


uh
 that
 is
 U
 the
 same
 as
 a
 smaller


European
 member
 State
 and
 you
 know


mentally
 sometimes
 I'm
 giving
 this


advice
 that
 you
 should
 people
 you
 should


picture
 people
 naked
 I
 I
 never
 do
 that


because
 maybe
 you
 cannot
 unsee
 that
 that


mental
 image
 and
 I
 think
 that's


unhealthy
 I'm
 glad
 you're
 not
 trying


that
 on
 me
 so
 so
 instead
 what
 I
 picture


is
 that
 I
 have
 the
 450
 million
 Europeans


having
 my
 back
 uh
 you
 know
 we
 have
 this


discussion
 about
 crowd
 sizes
 and
 and
 you


know
 that
 is
 my
 crowd
 size
 that
 that
 is


what
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 uh
 when
 I'm
 in


such
 a


meeting
 uh
 and
 then
 for
 me
 mentally
 that


that
 is
 balancing
 uh
 things
 out
 but
 yeah


you
 have
 a
 crowd
 size
 but
 I
 mean
 you


still
 have
 the
 biggest
 companies
 in
 the


world
 trying
 to
 Lobby
 you
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


you
 have
 uh
 the
 big
 Nations
 you
 have
 uh


the
 big
 geopolitical
 powers
 and
 so
 on
 um


what
 what
 is
 the
 toughest
 thing
 you
 have


experienced


well
 I
 think
 when
 I
 have
 uh
 when
 I
 find


that
 things
 are
 tough
 is
 if
 there
 is
 a


lack
 of
 respect
 of
 the


legitimacy
 of
 the
 laws
 that
 we
 have
 we


have
 a
 well
 functioning
 democracy
 we


have
 well-functioning
 ways
 of
 of


drafting
 legislation
 discussing


legislation
 passing
 legislation
 when
 I


find
 that
 when
 I
 I
 question
 our
 world


order
 is
 if
 a
 business
 maybe
 gigantic


maybe
 smaller
 says
 yeah
 but
 don't
 care


about
 your
 rules
 because
 if
 if


businesses
 with
 this
 kind
 of
 power
 goes


Rogue
 then
 we
 have
 a
 problem
 I
 haven't


seen
 that
 in
 full
 uh
 but
 sometimes
 I
 see


a
 tendency
 uh
 of
 that
 and
 and
 that
 of


course
 is
 uh
 is
 extremely
 worrying
 uh


for
 our
 democracy
 how
 do
 you
 relax


what's
 uh
 key
 to
 you
 having
 a
 bit
 of
 a


higger
 um
 I
 will
 I
 will
 uh
 run
 I
 try
 to


do
 that
 every
 second
 day
 I'm
 not
 always


successful
 but
 I
 try
 to
 that
 and
 I'm
 a


very
 eager


Knitter
 uh
 and
 I
 find
 that
 you
 know
 a


lot
 of
 the
 work
 that
 I
 do
 is
 is
 based
 on


words
 I
 listen
 a
 lot
 uh
 I
 talk
 a
 lot
 I


read
 a
 lot
 uh
 so
 you
 know
 producing


something
 with
 my
 hands
 and
 the
 feeling


of
 of
 yarn
 of
 wool
 silk
 alpaka
 you
 know


that
 is
 a
 I
 think
 a
 very


soothing
 uh
 grounding
 thing
 for
 for
 me


to
 do
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 Pity
 that
 you
 cannot


wear
 more
 than
 one
 sweater
 at
 a
 time


because
 I'm
 I'm
 quite


productive
 what
 do
 you
 read
 I
 read
 uh
 um


novels
 uh
 it's
 really
 rare
 that
 I
 lead


read
 sort
 of
 leadership
 um
 uh
 literature


uh
 because
 since
 since
 leadership
 is


about
 people
 I
 find
 that
 a
 a
 novel
 is
 a


is
 a
 way
 to
 learn
 about
 people
 that
 I


would
 never
 ever
 meet
 that
 I
 would
 not


have
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 close
 to
 I
 would


not
 be
 able
 to
 get
 under
 their


skin
 so
 I
 find
 that
 is
 uh
 that
 is
 really


important
 for
 me
 uh
 I
 just
 read
 a
 book


which
 is
 I'm
 in
 the
 process
 of
 reading
 a


book
 of
 um
 a
 Finnish
 writer
 called


kvest
 it
 is
 a


skur
 so
 it's
 a
 dusk
 41
 I
 don't
 actually


know
 what
 is
 the
 the
 English
 title
 um
 so


it
 takes
 place
 under
 the
 Second
 World


War
 uh
 it's
 a
 man
 and
 a
 woman's


perspective
 they
 take
 turns
 uh
 and
 they


are
 in
 a
 relationship
 and
 it's
 very


telling
 uh
 both
 of
 the
 historical


situation
 of
 the
 The
 Finnish
 uh


geography
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Wars
 they


have
 had
 so
 many
 they've
 been
 so
 tough


on
 them
 and
 uh
 and
 how
 people
 respond
 to


war
 so
 even
 though
 it
 takes
 place
 during


the
 second
 world
 war
 it's
 uh
 uh
 it's
 a


very
 uh
 moving
 touching


insightful
 um
 recollection
 of
 how
 people


react
 to
 War
 uh
 also
 those
 who
 not


directly
 a
 soldier
 or
 or
 faced
 with
 it


so
 I
 would
 I
 would
 highly
 highly


recommend
 it
 I
 will
 um
 I
 will
 order
 it


straight
 away
 um
 now
 what
 um
 what
 advice


do
 you
 have
 to
 young
 people
 I
 think
 I


think
 they
 are
 in
 a
 in
 a
 difficult


situation
 um
 because
 they
 have
 I
 think


as
 we
 all
 have
 had
 the
 the
 uncertainty


am
 I
 good
 enough
 uh
 how
 do
 I
 look
 uh
 do


they
 see
 my


weaknesses
 uh
 do
 I
 have
 a
 social


network
 um
 all
 that
 has
 been
 accelerated


and
 I
 think
 uh
 on
 on
 speed
 because
 of
 uh


uh
 quite
 a
 number
 of
 things
 uh
 and


unfortunately
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we're


done
 dealing
 with
 the
 pandemic
 yet
 I


think
 for
 young
 people
 it
 has
 taken
 a


hold
 that
 adults
 have
 we
 have
 moved
 on


but
 I
 think
 it
 taken
 a
 hold
 in
 in
 many


young
 people
 so
 I
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 to
 say
 You're
 Not


Alone
 we
 adults
 we're
 here
 for
 you
 you


have
 friends
 you
 have
 there
 are
 other


young
 people
 who
 are
 in
 the
 same


situation
 don't
 think
 that
 you're
 alone


we
 we
 want
 to
 listen
 to
 you
 we
 want
 to


help
 you
 we
 rely
 on
 you
 for
 our
 society


to
 change
 and
 even
 if
 you
 feel
 alone
 and


you
 have
 anxieties
 and
 you
 have


challenges
 um
 Society
 needs
 you
 I
 think


that
 is
 an
 important
 message
 to
 to
 any


Young
 Generation
 wonderful
 that's
 um
 a


very
 nice
 place
 to
 to
 end
 it's
 been
 uh


fantastic
 talking
 to
 you
 uh
 big
 thanks


for
 all
 your
 important
 work
 and
 uh
 all


the
 best
 going
 forward
 well
 thank
 you


very
 much
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 podcast


I
 I
 enjoyed
 very
 much
 uh
 myself
 so
 um
 I


think
 that's
 also
 part
 of
 the


transparency
 of
 how
 people
 think
 uh
 in


walks
 of
 life
 so
 thank
 you
 very
 much
