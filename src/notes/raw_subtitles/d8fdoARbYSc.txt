Today we're going to dive into the movie analysis of "Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Arc"
"The Infinity Castle Arc" unfolds with three battles
They are: Butterflies Shinobu vs Upper Rank Two Doma
Zenitsu vs Upper Rank Six Gyutaro
Tanjiro and Giyu vs Upper Rank Three Akaza
These three scenes touch on a key theme of Demon Slayer
What does a demon actually mean?
Demon Slayer is set in Japan's Taisho era
And Muzan is at least 1,000 years old
Back‑calculating puts his origin around the 10th century AD
Muzan had already become Japan's first demon in history
That period was Japan's Heian era
It coincides with when ancient texts began recording people being eaten by demons
At the very beginning, people believed in demons
But there was no concept of demon slaying
Because they didn't even know what a demon truly was
Demons symbolize humanity's helplessness when facing unknown forces
At that time, onmyoji could only teach people how to avoid demons
But they couldn't actually exorcise or kill demons
They were more like weather forecasters
Informing people that disaster was coming
But unable to stop the disaster
In the final battle of Infinity Castle,
Muzan said the following to Tanjiro:
What Muzan symbolizes is
It is a destructive force beyond human comprehension
Like natural disasters, viruses, plagues
People cannot avoid it nor easily trace its origin
However, up until the 14th century Muromachi period
Japanese demons were no longer just unknown entities
But began to appear in various forms
And also began to develop demon‑slaying stories that humans could confront
In the three battles of Infinity Castle
They happen to each answer the question of what a demon is
In the first battle
Butterfly Ninja faces Douma
Butterfly Ninja discovers that Douma is actually the enemy who killed her sister
Her sister, before dying, told her not to avenge her
She hoped Butterfly Ninja could have happiness like an ordinary girl
Live until she becomes an old woman
But why specifically emphasize “like a girl” achieving happiness?
Because in ancient Japan
Men could directly seek revenge
But women were bound by family and husbands
They had to endure
And could not directly take revenge on outsiders
These unresolved grudges
Eventually become vengeful spirits
For example, The Tale of Heike tells the story of “Ujibashi‑hime”
She was abandoned by her husband
Because of resentment she turned into a ghost
The so‑called “female ghost”
In fact, it is the repressed anger of a patriarchal society and a hidden ghost story
Thus, in the Heian‑period novel “Dai Chuu Nagon Monogatari” it mentions
“Ghosts and women both possess aspects that humans cannot see”
Japanese female ghosts also have another origin
According to legend, when the Japanese emperor conquered frontier regions
he discovered that some places actually had female tribal leaders, queens
If these places were pacified
or chose to side with the royal family
they would be praised and named “wise women” (sakasime)
However, women who defied the emperor’s orders
such as Goma‑hime
would be regarded as evil and wayward
In historical records they would be despised as earth spiders
considered monsters that must be eliminated
Because the Japanese court did not recognize that women could hold power
Even today, some regions in Japan
the locals worship earth spiders
Here, we see a contradiction
When outrageous injustice occurs
if women become too angry, too powerful
they will be demonized by those in power as monsters
But if they suppress their anger too much and harbor deep resentment
women will eventually become monsters themselves
Shinobu the Butterfly is like a being living within this contradiction
Shinobu has always been suppressing her anger so no one can see it
Even when facing demons, she always wears a smile
Only Tanjiro noticed
Shinobu has been continually suppressing her anger
<font color=#FFE100FF>Are you angry?</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>You always exude the scent of anger</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Even though you always keep a smile</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>That's true</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>I might have been angry all along</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Since my beloved sister was brutally killed by a demon</font>
So what should we do with this power of anger?
American civil rights activist Audre Lorde pointed out
Anger actually helps our personal growth
Knowing that we have inner strength
Being able to use that power to transform society
Identifying what oppression exists in society
And who the oppressors are
Shinobu asked the demon about its characteristics before her sister died
So that her anger could find the correct target for revenge
She discovered that Douma was the enemy who killed her sister
Anger opened the part that humans cannot see
Those injustices hidden by society
In the second showdown
We saw another side of the demon
Kuyue was originally Zenitsu's senior
Zenitsu regarded him as a role model for learning
Because both of them are orphans
They had no family to rely on since childhood
Their starting points are very similar
Grandfather has always treated both of them equally
He hopes they will both become heirs of the Thunder Breathing style
Because Zenitsu only knows the First Form: Thunderclap and Flash
But Kuyue has learned other forms, yet he never mastered the First Form
However, the two with similar starting points
ultimately took completely opposite paths
In the match between Kuyue and Zenitsu
we see the relationship Jung described as “self and shadow”
Jung believes
that the parts of self‑awareness that are rejected and repressed do not disappear
but instead form shadows in the subconscious
becoming an unknown part of ourselves
The self and the shadow are like twin siblings
They complement each other, yet oppose each other
When we find someone extremely annoying,
it is likely because we project our own shadow onto others
For example, Jung discovered
Americans often project their inferior personalities onto Black people and Indigenous peoples
considering them inferior
It appears as racial discrimination that belittles others
But actually it's projecting one's own inner darkness onto others
The same
The phenomena of gods and demons are also a projection of shadows
Humans project their idealized perfect image onto others
Calling them gods and goddesses
Or projecting the shadows they resist onto others
Calling them demons
This explains the hostility between 獪岳 and 善逸
Because they see their own shadows in each other
the parts they lack and try to suppress
Zenitsu is kind and knows how to give
but often shows a cowardly side
causing 獪岳 to recall the childhood memories he tried to suppress
the version of himself lacking strength and only running away
獪岳, on the other hand, fears death, is selfish, and only wants to take
as if a box with a hole, never able to be filled
To gain more power, 獪岳 ultimately chose to join the demons
Believing that demon power can perfect the Thunder Breathing
He was originally a senior disciple envied by Zenitsu and considered a model to learn from
Now he has become a demon
Transforming the Thunder Breathing into a kind of evil demon technique
Doesn't this mean that Zenitsu, who also inherits Thunder Breathing
has become a kindred using the same breathing as demons
the demon that should have been eradicated by the Demon Slayer Corps
suddenly becomes very close
As if it's a duplicate of oneself
This makes Zenitsu try to deny and suppress this shadow
Encountering the demon Koyou in the Infinity Castle
It is like meeting one's own shadow in the infinite space of the subconscious
Thus the duel between Zenitsu and Koyou
is actually the problem of how the self integrates the shadow
In this duel, both are familiar with the Thunder Breathing
It's as if the same breathing technique is fighting each other within a web
The opposition between self and shadow becomes an endless conflict
Jung believed that when the opposition between self and shadow is too intense
to transcend this opposition
one must create new symbolic forms in the mental space
to possibly break away from the original conflict pattern
And this is precisely why Zenitsu ultimately triumphs
no longer entangled with the shadow
but creates a form that belongs to himself
Seventh Form: Fire Thunder God
Precisely because the "black shadow" of Koyou exists
that allows Zenitsu's newly created Thunder Form to appear particularly "bright"
no longer just remains at the level of only knowing the First Form
The shadow is not the opposite of the self
but a presence that lets the self stand out
And in the third duel
the demon is no longer just an individual shadow
but an existence that society attempts to collectively exclude and suppress
Yorozaza was born into a poor family
To treat his father's illness, he had to resort to theft to obtain money
Later, after being caught, he was tattooed on his body to mark his crimes
In classical Japanese literature
there are frequent records of thieves being considered demons
For example, it is said that the two‑faced Sukuna with four arms and four legs would rob everywhere
And the prototype of Yorozaza may be the demon Kidonmaru in the collection "Kokon Chomonshu"
It is said that he had teeth from birth
Just like Komahachi, who was born with a pair of fangs
When he grew up, he also sought revenge for his father
In the end, he was exiled due to his many crimes
Similarly,
Upper Moon Four: Half Tengu
also habitually stole in life, later becoming a demon
But why were thieves considered demons?
In ancient Japan
people who did not submit to the Emperor
were regarded by the court as dark entities
Those in power would dehumanize these people into demons
Thus they could dispatch troops to subjugate them
Many stories of slaying monsters and demons
were used to reinforce the legitimacy of the samurai class
For example, people from Hokkaido were called "Ezo"
Or during World War II, Japanese were referred to by the US military as "kijuku"
portraying them as evil demons that threaten the world
This way we don't need to treat them humanely
This is precisely the treatment Koma received during his life
If we compare, we will find
the people in the Demon Slayer Corps
In fact, most of them are also marginalized individuals excluded from society's framework
and they all have tragic pasts
Tanjiro's family are rural villagers who sell charcoal
Zenitsu and Inosuke are both abandoned children
The Stone Pillar is blind
Butterfly Ninja, when she was young, saw her sister being killed by Douma
Muichiro lost both parents in his childhood
His older brother was then attacked by demons
The Demon Slayer Corps formed by these marginalized people
is an underground organization not recognized by the government
After joining the Demon Slayer Corps
you have to constantly move between mountains and villages
This was actually quite unusual in Japan at that time
Ordinary people spend their whole lives living settled lives
Why do members of the Demon Slayer Corps have to keep moving through the mountains and forests?
If demons are symbols of natural disasters and plagues
then wherever demons go
the Demon Slayer Corps must go there to dispel the disaster
to deal with bodies discarded in the mountainous regions
This mobile nature
suggests that they are like a homeless group roaming the mountains
This type of population living in the mountains without household registration
is called “mountain dwellers” (サンカ)
According to estimates
During the Meiji period, mountain dwellers numbered at least 200,000
Folklorist Yanagita Kunio believed
that Japan has a type of mountain people living in the hills
they are actually Japan's true indigenous people
Originally lived on the plains
but were later driven out and moved to the mountains
leading a hunting-and-gathering lifestyle
This was the inspiration Yanagita Kunio got after reading material on Taiwan's indigenous peoples
The ancient Han–indigenous conflicts that occurred in Taiwan
which caused indigenous people to move to the mountains
Similar events may have also occurred in ancient Japan
When lowland people encountered mountain people
they described them as yokai resembling tengu
and even believed they possessed supernatural powers beyond those of ordinary humans
This leads us to an interesting conclusion
In the eyes of lowland people
the Demon Slayer Corps and the demons they kill are not separate entities
instead they are seen as the same kind of being
both are mountain people who have left lowland society
both are outcasts excluded from social order
The pairing of Tanjiro and Nezuko
are people who were almost turned into demons
<font color=#F1FF00FF>I was lucky enough to keep my human body</font>
<font color=#F1FF00FF>If we were unlucky, both of us might have become demons </font>
In the Entertainment District arc
the demon formed by the sibling duo Jifutarō and Daki
just like the mirror image of Tanjiro and Nezuko
reflecting the fate they could have originally taken
Thus
the story of Demon Slayer
becomes a battle between two groups of outcasts not recognized by society
Both sides share tragic pasts
Some choose to join the Demon Slayer Corps
but some choose to join the Twelve Kizuki
as if it's the hidden dark side of Japanese history
a history belonging to demons
Wait
So what exactly is a demon?
<font color=#FFE100FF>I’ll tell you why you’re missing that final step and can’t reach the highest realm</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Because you are human</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Because you will age, because you will die</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Become a demon then, Kyojuro</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>In that case</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Whether it’s a hundred years or two hundred years</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>you can keep training and become stronger</font>
In this confrontation with the Flame Pillar Kyojuro
Akaza pointed out the biggest difference between humans and demons
Humans, unlike demons, don't die
Demons can have hundreds of years to train
Continuously improving their abilities
For Akaza
The duty of the strong is to become stronger
And becoming a demon is the ultimate means to become stronger
Likewise,
Before Kokushibo became a demon
He was originally an outstanding swordsman from the Warring States period
But he felt inferior because he could not defeat his younger brother
He wanted to become the strongest samurai
He longed to reach the highest level
Thus, he accepted Muzan's proposal
And became a demon
Hoping to become a being that surpasses humanity
For Akaza and Kokushibo
In order to become stronger
They can even abandon their humanity
This strength‑first value system
reflects the late 19th century
a major challenge faced by Japanese society
which was the need to keep up with the prevailing international values of the time: Social Darwinism
It stems from the ideology of survival struggle promoted by the British philosopher Spencer
Using Darwin's theory of evolution to promote
survival of the fittest, the unfit are eliminated
Because that’s how natural law works
This is exactly the principle that Yewaza and Black Death believe
<font color=#FFE100FF>Yewaza</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>If you’re not convinced</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>then propose a deadly battle to change the rankings</font>
What the winner says is justice
Power is the principle
Relations between nations
are just an amplified version of relationships between individuals
Japan wants to join the ranks of the strong
so it must conquer outward
win the Russo-Japanese War
colonize Korea and Taiwan
so it won’t be seen as weak or a loser internationally
This philosophy of eliminating the unfit
swept Japan in the late 19th century
Spence’s work became a bestseller at the time
Japanese intellectuals even debated
whether Japanese should intermarry with white people
to obtain the blood of a higher race
so they could become stronger and more superior
Diplomat Kaneko Kentarō and Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi both consulted Spence
hoping to use eugenics to turn the Japanese into a dominant race
This is exactly what in Demon Slayer
some people choose to become demons
Obtain the blood of a powerful group
and become stronger
Thus, demons become the desire of humans to surpass human abilities
But in the Flame Pillar
we see a counter to Akaza’s “the strong are supreme” doctrine
<font color=#FFE100FF>Decaying, aging, moving toward death</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>It is the brevity of human life that brings beauty</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Precisely because humans age, because humans die</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Only then are people so lovely, so noble</font>
Humans are fleeting and fragile beings
But this is not a flaw of humanity
Indeed, because of human finiteness
Therefore everyone has someone they must protect
The strong have a duty to protect the weak
The strength of the strong becomes meaningful
<font color=#FFE100FF>Helping the weak anytime, anywhere is your duty as someone born strong</font>
In the clash with Akaza
the Flame Pillar acted to consider Tanjiro, the weak one
and became distracted during the fight
ultimately losing to Akaza
After being wounded, the Flame Pillar could not recover
because he is a flesh-and-blood human
but Akaza, being a demon, can continuously regenerate
without worrying about birth, aging, illness, or death
And when fighting Akaza in the Infinity Castle
Tanjiro presented a rebuttal argument different from Kyojuro's
The strong should support the weak
Because no one can grow up alone without needing others' care
Everyone is a baby at birth
In the eyes of adults, they are all weak
They must be cared for by others in order to gradually grow and become strong
If we follow Akaza's “survival of the unfit” logic
Then we should let all infants fend for themselves
This would cause human societies to be unable to continue
The reason human societies can continue
is because the strong are willing to help the weak
Akaza firmly believes in the superiority of the strong, precisely because he has forgotten
that when he was vulnerable, he too was someone who needed to be cared for
That allowed him to survive to today
His existence is proof that the strong should protect the weak
Tanjiro's mutual aid theory
In the eyes of modern people
might be seen as too naive, too simple
But in the Taisho era setting of Demon Slayer
it was actually a once‑popular social trend
Especially in rural areas
mutual aid remains a common traditional virtue
The Russian thinker Lev Mechnikov
when he visited Japan in 1874
found that the rural environment was harsh
Frequent encounters with natural disasters and anomalies
Farmers must cooperate to survive together
Otherwise there is only a dead end
This scene of mutual aid
Makes him reconsider another possibility of humanity
The progress of human civilization is not about the strong surviving and the weak being eliminated
But building a community of collective mutual aid
Both the strong and the weak can contribute
Historian Koshihara Sho calls this Japanese rural spirit “Cooperatism” (cooperatism)
Just like Rintaki Sakonji said
Although each person is just a small gear in society
But when placed together
They can set the gears of fate in motion
Propelling human history forward
Every person's life is brief and fragile
But even if a single demon hunter dies
The will to slay demons will be passed on to the collective
Allowing this gear system to keep turning
One does not need to become a demon
And can achieve the “eternity” that Muzan dreamed of
Because humanity can pass its will down through generations
<font color=#FFE100FF> Humanity's will is eternal</font>
After Lev Mechnikov returned to Russia
He wrote a book on Japan's cooperatism
Inspiring an entire generation of Russian intellectuals
From Tolstoy to the anarchist father Kropotkin, all were deeply inspired
Later, Kropotkin even teamed up with the famous Taishō‑era Japanese novelist Takeo Arishima
They organized a transnational network
Practicing this grassroots mutual aid through action
To improve the lives of Japanese farmers
Arishima Gorō converted his land in Hokkaido into a shared farm
Open free to all tenant farmers for cultivation
Advocating the union to share all land
Arishima Gorō wrote the four characters “mutual assistance” on a local monument
This spirit is precisely the mutual aid theory that Tanjiro believes in
etc.
But people inevitably distinguish between you and me
Isn’t this mutual aid theory an overly naive ideal?
On this issue
Tanjiro gave us the final answer
The “mutual aid theory” must be paired with the sudden enlightenment of “selflessness”
In the climax of the showdown with Akaza
Tanjiro recalled his father’s words
Control your breathing
Close specific bloodlines
Breathe with your body
Your mind becomes transparent
You will see the “clear world” and enter a selfless state
In Vipassana meditation
There is a technique called body scanning
It can lead a person into a similar state
The so-called “inner observation” is to see clearly the nature of reality
What is the nature of reality?
It is that the self does not exist
We all assume that whatever arises in the mind must be my thoughts and feelings
But why do we think the mind is the boundary of the self?
When we become overly immersed in a movie's plot
we unconsciously place ourselves into the characters
as if the protagonist's emotions are “mine”
Similarly
Our mind is actually like a little inner theater
Many thoughts and feelings aren't actually yours
they just happen to appear in your mind
seeking to capture your attention
making you think they are your own thoughts and feelings
The “body scan” in insight meditation trains people to focus their attention on the breath
instead of on thoughts or feelings
Pay attention to the air of your breathing
as it flows freely between the various boundaries of the body
Visualize the pain leaving the body with each breath
This kind of body scan
is like the breathing technique in Demon Slayer
Even if pain exists in the body
you can remain indifferent to it
and not feel the pain
Because one's own feelings are themselves an illusion
The pain is not mine
Thus a person can eliminate his own fighting spirit
Because the fighting spirit is not mine
Tanjiro likens this state to a “plant”
When the mind enters a transparent world
It becomes like a plant
1963
Vietnamese monk Thich Guangde publicly protested the government's persecution of Buddhists
He set himself on fire with gasoline on a Saigon street
According to a reporter who witnessed it on site
Thich Guangde did not twitch a single muscle
He was unusually calm
As if nothing had happened
It was as if a plant was sitting there
Perhaps at the moment of his death
Like Tanjiro
Entered a selfless transparent world
This selfless realm
Not only allowed Tanjiro to defeat Akaza
But also let the boundaries between self and others gradually disappear
<font color=#FFE100FF>You helped me, so you are already a part of me</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>I will fight in your place</font>
Selflessness instead makes one feel a new connection with fellow humans
It can be said to be the philosophical foundation of Tanjiro's mutual aid theory
At the end of the Infinity Castle showdown
Tanjiro's theory of mutual aid awakens Akaza's forgotten past
When the memories slowly surface
Rinsetsu asks back: Why are you so obsessed with becoming stronger?
At that moment, Akaza finally recalls his past memories
In this respect, Akaza is very similar to Muichiro Tokito
Both have lost their past memories
And they hold a belief in the superiority of the strong
<font color=#FFE100FF>Even if you save an immature swordsmith apprentice, it's useless</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Helping others </font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>In the end, it will also help yourself</font>
It wasn't until Tanjiro emphasized the importance of mutual assistance
that Muichiro slowly recalled his past memories
When Muichiro was trapped in the Water Prison bowl by the jade vessel
when he was on the brink of death
the swordsmith, originally considered weak
instead gave Muichiro more oxygen
allowing him to use his breathing technique again
Eventually, Muichiro finally awakened his forgotten memories
It turns out Tanjiro's mutual aid theory
is the belief he himself held in his childhood
<font color=#FFE100FF>Acting to help others</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>In the end, it will also help yourself</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>Dad has said it before</font>
Similarly, Akaza's desire to become a stronger version of himself
It is to facilitate theft so he can help his seriously ill father
It is also to protect the one he loves
Because he had already promised Ren Xue on the night of the fireworks
He will protect her for a lifetime
Akaza wants to become strong
In fact, it is precisely to protect the weak around him
In this way, Akaza is no longer Tanjiro's opposite
And it happens to embody the idea of the strong protecting the weak
Just because he forgot why he fights
That leads him to become the opposite of Tanjiro
This type of memory‑losing demon also appears in the “Natagumo Mountain” arc
Even after becoming a demon, Rui remains attached to the family bonds from his life
He demands that the demons he controls pretend to be his family
Yet he himself does not know why he does this
The original desire has been forgotten
Yet the subject still enacts this desire
In the examples of Akaza and Rui
We see what psychoanalysis calls the “repetition compulsion” (repetition compulsion)
When a person experiences overly stimulating or traumatic events
the past memories cannot enter the conscious system
The person cannot recall what happened in the past
522
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21:907
Yet the body continuously repeats past behavioral patterns
Because the memory has not actually disappeared
but is retained in the subconscious
driving the body to constantly repeat the past
But I don’t even know what I’m repeating
Whenever Akaza recruits strong individuals to join the demons
In fact, it’s just repeating helping my master’s dojo recruit newcomers
Whenever Akaza launches a fireworks‑like attack
It reenacts the night of fireworks when I made a promise with Renkyu
Whenever Akaza attacks the weak whom I disdain
It repeats the attack on the weak who slipped poison into the dojo that day
Whenever Akaza uses the Compass perception
It recalls once more the hair accessory on Renkyu’s head
Akaza’s Compass can sense everything
But it cannot sense the memories hidden in its own subconscious
Thus
The existence of demons takes on a completely different meaning
Demons are actually people who have lost their memories and keep repeating the past
Because their memories have been replaced by Muzan’s cellular memory
When they recall, they see Muzan’s memories
Not their own memories
Demons are no longer beings that must be defeated
But rather existences yearning to alleviate their symptoms and attain redemption
Tanjiro’s job is not just killing demons
It is more like that of a psychoanalyst
Helping demons retrieve their memories from when they were alive
Recall the past
Express the regrets they never had time to voice while alive
In the moment of confronting the past
The ghost turned back into a human
The ghost is no longer a being different from humans
Because anyone could unknowingly become a ghost
Only yearning to constantly become stronger
Obsessively clinging to a certain path, a certain destination
Yet forgetting what they are fighting for
Why we have come to today
Demon Slayer is like a collective psychoanalysis therapy
Let the amnesiac modern people
Recall a hundred years ago
The mutual humanity people once possessed
That makes the modern society constantly yearning to become richer and stronger
