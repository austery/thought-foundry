- When people think about robots,
they usually imagine something
like a Boston Dynamics robot,
metallic and humanoid.
But the robots we'll see in the future
might not look like that at all.
I mean, if humans are
interacting with something
on a daily basis, it's
probably best not to make it
sharp, delicate, and heavy.
- How rude.
- [Derek] Instead, advanced
robots might be made safer
if they're soft, flexible,
and all kinds of shapes and sizes.
So instead of Sonny from I, Robot.
- No.
- [Derek] Something like
Baymax from "Big Hero 6"
might be closer to what's in our future.
- Balalala.
- This is a compilation
video of five of my videos
on the surprisingly different
ways robots can look,
and why we build them that way.
This is my first time trying out a series,
and honestly, it's been a busy
time for the Veritasium team.
We're working on some exciting
things in the background.
But in the meantime,
we wanted to put this
together for all of you.
And I also caught up
with Dr. Elliot Hawkes,
the scientist behind two of these robots,
to get an update on
how they're progressing
and when we can expect
to see them in our lives.
Are there more developments happening
with the jumping robots?
- We have a whole nother
project on jumping,
and it doesn't even use springs.
So I won't give away our our secrets yet.
But keep an eye out for that one too,
'cause that's gonna be fun.
- So you have another jumping robot
which has a totally novel design?
- Yep.
- And you think it's gonna be better
than the one that you had before?
- Correct.
- And I just wanna shout out
our longtime sponsor, Brilliant.
They've supported the channel since 2021,
and it's great to get
to talk about something
that I actually use myself.
I've had Brilliant on my phone for years,
and it just allows me to
learn something new every day,
instead of, say, doom scrolling.
You should make valuable use of your time.
So I will tell you more about
Brilliant later in the video.
Non-humanoid robots aren't just safer
for us to interact with.
One of their biggest advantages
over traditional robots
is that they don't just do things
humans already do, but better.
Instead, they're specialized
to master entirely new abilities,
often ones that no human can tackle.
This is a robot that can grow
to hundreds of times its size,
and it can't be stopped
by adhesives or spikes.
Although it looks kind
of simple and cheap,
it has dozens of potential applications,
including one day maybe saving your life.
These robots can be made
out of almost any material,
but they all follow the
same basic principle.
Powered by compressed air,
they grow from the tip.
- That's good.
- [Derek] And this allows the robot
to pass through tight spaces,
and also over sticky surfaces.
- Something like a car
will get stuck to it.
It gets stuck in the wheels.
Now if I do the same
thing with the vine robot,
see the robot is able to extend.
- [Derek] It can navigate this curvy
and twisted passageway effortlessly,
which suggests some of the applications
it's well suited for.
Now, you might think spikes
would be the downfall
of an inflatable robot.
But even if it's punctured,
as long as you have
sufficient air pressure,
the robot keeps going.
- And you might be able to hear it.
It's actually leaking now.
So I'll have to turn up the pressure.
This by itself is not yet a robot.
But once we add steering,
a camera, some sensors,
and maybe some intelligence as
to where we're directing it,
then we could say it's a robot.
So this is sort of the
backbone of a robot.
This is what allows us to
build our type of robots.
- [Derek] So where did the
idea for this device come from?
- I had a vine in my
office that was on a shelf,
and it was kinda out of the sunlight.
And over the course of like a year or so,
it slowly grew out this tendril,
out and around the edge of the shelf
and towards the sunlight.
I said, that's a pretty cool
thing it just did, right?
So you start thinking,
well, is there a way you
could do that robotically?
- [Derek] The solution is really
elegant in its simplicity.
Just take some airtight tubing
and fold it in on itself.
It's kinda like a water wiggly,
those toys that are really hard to hold.
When you inflate it with compressed air,
it starts growing out from the tip.
And if you want the tube to
always bend at a certain spot,
you could just tape the
tubing on the outside
to shorten one of the sides.
For example, you could tape
it into a helical shape
to create a deployable antenna.
What about getting them to retract?
- Yeah, that's a challenging problem.
When you're in a constrained environment,
all you really have to do is
pull on, we call it the tail,
so the material that is passing through
the core of the body.
You pull on it and it basically outgrows,
it just goes back inside itself.
Now if you're in a big open area like this
and you try pulling on that,
instead of inverting, so retracting,
it tends to kinda coil
up and make a ugly shape.
- [Derek] And the engineers
have come up with ways
to retract the tube to
prevent it from buckling
using internal rollers.
But the tube doesn't have
to be the same diameter
the whole way along.
Here there's actually
a much wider section.
Think of it like a pillow
that's packed into the end of the robot.
- Yeah, if you could
sit cross-legged on it.
- Cross-legged on the table?
This sounds super sketchy.
So it grows underneath
the table just as usual,
and then, as the pillow
part starts inflating.
Is this not good, or is this okay?
It can actually lift me up.
So my balance is not great, as we can see.
- [Elliot] Try standing on it.
- Stand on it?
- Yeah.
- What's amazing is that
this doesn't require
much pressure above atmospheric.
Just a tenth of an atmosphere
applied over a large area,
like a square meter, can
lift something as heavy
as a thousand kilograms, all
the while remaining soft.
Whoa.
Woo. That was great.
That's the paradoxical
thing about pressure.
You can get a large overall
force with low pressure
as long as the area is large enough.
What sort of area is
that, that pillow there?
- It's 600 square inches.
So with one PSI, 600 pounds.
- Yeah, that's just crazy.
- Two PSI, 1,200 pounds.
- [Derek] And the whole
time, it feels really soft.
- Yeah, 'cause there's
a couple PSI, right?
- [Derek] It's important
that the device is still soft
so it doesn't hurt anyone.
- So you can design these things
to have cross-section that
changes along its length.
So it could be a very small body
that could grow into, for
example, a collapsed building
and potentially lift a large object
off someone who's trapped,
or maybe in a car crash
or something like that.
It can apply huge forces
with very soft and
lightweight, cheap materials.
- [Derek] These robots
can also be deployed
in search and rescue operations
by attaching sensors like
a camera onto the front.
- These robots are actually
really hard to stop.
So you can take them,
grow them into a clutter,
potentially a collapsed
building or something like that,
and they will continue to go somewhere.
An alternative is, they're so cheap.
I mean, they're basically free.
You could grow a hundred
of 'em, let's say,
into a collapsed building
with some sensing on them,
and maybe only one of them finds somebody.
But I mean, that's a
huge success if it does.
- [Derek] But how do you keep a camera
connected to the front of the robot
when it grows out from the tip?
Well, one way is to use an end cap,
which allows that camera
just to stay on the front,
pushed from behind by the robot.
But there are other
mechanisms of attachment.
The tiny wireless camera is
mounted on an external frame,
but this frame interlocks
with an internal frame,
which is actually inside
the pressurized part
of the robot body.
It's similar to how a
roller coaster's wheels
go around the track.
So this prevents the
camera from falling off
as the robot grows.
What's really interesting
is how the vine robot
can be actively steered.
They attach artificial
muscles to the robot.
So the way this muscle works
is that if you inflate it,
it expands sideways,
which leads to it contracting in length.
- We don't actually use these much anymore
because although it's soft,
it's still somewhat stiff.
So what we use instead
are simply tubes of this
ripstop nylon fabric,
with the braid oriented at 45 degrees.
So in this sense,
we just have one single
layer of airtight fabric.
This is the main robot body here.
Then we have three pneumatic
muscles connected to it.
Now, these three muscles
are each connected to
their own air supply,
connected to regulators over here.
As the robot extends from the tip,
we can steer it by shortening
and lengthening the sides.
So just the way your hand works
is if I shorten this tendon in my arm,
my hand will move this way.
Or if I shorten the one on this side,
it'll move the other way.
So our vine robot, we have
these muscles along its side,
so as they inflate,
they'll turn it one way.
Then if I inflate the
one on the other side,
it'll turn the other way.
- [Derek] So the vine robot
can fit through tight spaces,
it doesn't typically
get stuck on anything,
and isn't bothered by sharp objects.
And once you attach that
camera on the front,
it's ideal for things like archeology.
The robot was actually taken to Peru
to investigate some very narrow shafts.
- So we were looking at
this archeological site
that was built somewhere
between 1,500 and 500 BC
in the Andes Mountains of Peru,
and it was an ancient temple
that had all these underground spaces.
And part of what the
archeologists were doing
was trying to understand
what the spaces were for,
and what the people who built them
were trying to do with them.
So part of that was unknown.
But there were these giant rooms
that they called galleries,
and then there were these
small ducts, or tunnels
that were offshoots of these rooms,
and they wanted to know
where these ducts led,
but they were too small
for a person to go in.
So we were able to
successfully use the vine robot
to explore three of the tunnels
that couldn't have been
seen through other means,
which was super exciting.
And we got video inside the entire tunnels
and gave it to the archeology team.
- [Derek] There's an
application where I feel
like this solution is just so obvious
I wonder why it didn't exist before.
- Intubation is literally the process
of putting a tube into a patient.
The purpose is to breathe for the patient
when the patient isn't breathing.
And so traditionally, a
highly-trained medical professional
would take their laryngoscope,
come above the patient.
And once they see the trachea,
you start to pass your tube down inside.
I'm almost there. I can see the light.
So if you can see right now,
I just got it in to the trachea.
- Oh, yeah.
- Right there.
And it took me a couple minutes,
and I was really kinda
wrenching on this patient here.
So if there's somebody
who's not breathing,
every second counts.
- [Derek] But by using a miniature version
of this vine robot, researchers are hoping
to make intubation faster and safer.
- Somebody like me with no training
could pretty simply insert this device,
aim towards the nose,
and just like that, if you can
see, we've already intubated,
and all it took was a little
bit of pressurization.
Just like that.
- [Derek] It almost looks
like a sort of a party favor.
- Yeah, right?
It's like a, this reminds
me a lot of those inflatable
kinda like Play-Doh structures
that you see at car lots.
- [Derek] How does it know
to go down the right tube?
- Yeah, so that's one of
the kind of cool things
about soft robotics, is the
robot is quite compliant,
and we see that in a lot of these demos.
They can squish, they can bend.
And so, how we've designed it is that
the main robot grows
down into the esophagus,
and then we have this side branch
that heads towards the trachea,
and it's quite flexible.
And so, it basically finds the opening.
So it's a really neat example
of kind of a passive intelligence,
mechanical intelligence,
some people call it,
where it can find its path
even if we don't know
exactly the shape beforehand.
- [Derek] Have you tried
this on a real person yet?
- Not on a real person,
but we've actually tried
this in a cadaver lab,
and we've shown that we can move from
this nice idealized version
to an actual in vivo situation
and successfully intubate a patient.
- [Derek] There's another application,
which is burrowing into sand or soil.
When you blow compressed air
into something like sand,
it fluidizes, it becomes like a liquid,
and that can allow the vine robot
to grow into granular materials like sand.
- If you've ever been to the beach
and you try to stick your
umbrella pole into the ground,
it's fairly difficult.
- I'll try to push that
probe down into the sand,
no fluidization.
Yeah, it feels like it sort
of gets wedged in there.
- So now I'll turn on the air.
- Oh yeah, you can feel it immediately.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that's a lot.
- So what we've done here is essentially,
we just blow a jet of air
out the front of the robot,
and that loosens up the sand enough
to reduce the force of the
sand so that the robot,
just by tip extension,
can make its way through.
(air whooshing)
(rousing music)
- This makes vine robots
an attractive option
for NASA when they look for ways
to study the surfaces of other planets.
Recently on Mars, they tried
to have a burrowing robot,
but it got stuck.
Could you do it better
basically with this?
- Yeah, that's a good question.
So the Mars InSight mission,
they have this heat probe.
The idea there was to be able to sort of
hammer its way down into the core
and then place a sensor
that could detect the temperature of Mars.
However, the problem they ran into there
is that it turned out the
material that they put it in
was more cohesive than they expected.
Inside the robot, something
would wind up and pound it down,
wind up and pounded down.
But it turned out there
wasn't enough friction
between the probe and the sand.
So what was really happening
was it would wind up,
pound down, wind up, pound
down, wind up, pound down.
So it'd never actually go anywhere.
The advantage of something
like this, like tip extension,
is you'd have your base,
you start at the surface,
and you just keep extending your way down.
You're not necessarily
relying on the interaction
with what is surrounding
it to make it work.
- [Derek] What amazes me about vine robots
is how a plant inspired
this simple, elegant design.
It's so easy in fact that
you could build one yourself
in as little as a minute.
There are instructions
online that I'll link to.
But from that basic design have come
a huge variety of robots,
with different applications
from archeology
to search and rescue, or
intubation to space exploration.
And what else can you
think of to do with it?
- I've actually gotten a
lot of emails from viewers
about crazy ideas that
we hadn't thought of.
So keep 'em coming.
We love to hear your ideas.
- Are there any ideas
that you can share with us
that are like, oh, like
that's actually really cool?
- One idea was for
clearing mines, landmines.
So the idea was that you'd actually
run a vine robot through the field
and then detonate the landmines,
and basically make a path
that civilians could
walk through the field.
So I thought that was kind of a cool idea.
- Do you think they'd
create enough pressure
to trigger these things?
- I think the idea was
they were gonna actually
put explosives in the
vine to detonate the,
yeah, the land mines themselves.
- I mean, I'm also thinking,
now that you mention that,
like I'm thinking you could
put metal detector type sensors
on the vine robot.
- Absolutely.
- So spread them across the field
and they'll pick up where the mines are.
- I'll give you another crazy example.
Another one was for space
applications of docking,
so two spacecraft docking together,
you have to make an airtight seal.
And so, the idea was, well,
maybe you could use a
vine robot to do this.
- Some sort of like airlock or
something going out and then.
- So basically, yeah, you can imagine
the two tubes coming together, not sealed,
and then the vine robot growing through
and basically making the seal.
- Are there any updates
about the vine robot?
Like have the medical
trials gotten anywhere?
- So we just did a trial
with emergency medical
practitioners using our device.
We gave 'em five minutes of training,
we gave 'em the device,
and they were 90-ish percent
successful in intubating,
in very rapid, something like 20 seconds.
- Oh, wow.
- The nice thing about our our device
is that if it fails,
it fails in 20 seconds.
And so, it doesn't take
three minutes to attempt
and then realize you didn't get it.
I think something really nice about that
is that it is so rapid and easy
that even if it does fail,
you get another shot.
- Yeah, I mean, that one
seems like it's so close
to actually having a big
real world application.
I mean, how common are intubations?
- So intubations in the OR,
so operating room are quite common.
I think like 15 million a year.
That's probably not our initial target
'cause those are very
reliable, like 99% plus.
The fundamental problem is
that the tools are designed
for those doctors in those scenarios.
And what happens is those similar tools
get put out into the
field for an ambulance
and a paramedic is trying
to do an intubation,
but they're doing it maybe in the dark,
with someone in a poor body position,
where there's blood in the mouth.
So our device takes
that required skill out
and basically lets the vine robot
find the way into the trachea.
And so, pre-hospital,
there's around a million
intubations a year.
And we think many intubations
that aren't even attempted
because the tools just aren't there.
And then our kind of
long shot is eventually,
there's AEDs, the
defibrillators everywhere.
One issue there is there's not a way
to help the person breathe.
Possibly if we can make
this thing so simple,
it could basically be packaged with a AED,
where you could both get the heart going,
and you could intubate
and get the oxygen in.
But I think we're close.
It's pretty easy.
You'll have to come back
and get another video.
We'll let you intubate a cadaver.
That'll be fun.
- So we've kind of answered this question,
but are these robots, vine
robots still being worked on?
- We have a project
right now on anchoring,
especially we're interested in.
So if you think of a plant root.
If you ever try to pull out, I don't know,
like a small shrub or something,
it's incredibly hard, right?
Like you're looking at this,
it's got like a half an inch stem
and you're pulling on
it and pulling on it,
it's like hundreds of pounds of force.
So you're like how is this possible?
And I think one of the coolest things
is that a hundred pounds
of anchoring force
was created with almost no
reaction force initially.
There was like a seed that
slowly grew down into the ground.
- It's like all these little tendrils,
and I'm imagining the friction
sums over all of those.
- So basically, when you're
trying to go into the soil,
the thing resisting you is
the surface area of the tip.
That's what you're pushing in.
And then what's giving
you the anchoring force
is the surface area on the sides.
And so, you can imagine, if
you clump 'em all together,
the area in the tips doesn't change,
but the surface area
of the sides went down.
So you basically wanna split 'em up
into as many, practically.
So anyway, we're using that concept now
to make these anchors,
and we're working with
NASA now one as well.
And so, it's like this deployable anchor,
it's very light.
You could throw it
somewhere, or just drop it,
and then the roots grow down,
there's four roots that
grow down into the ground,
and it was something like
a hundred Newtons of force
to pull it out.
- Yeah, it sounds like a
very sci-fi type thing,
where you could like
throw the root pack down
and it just like phmf, and
then the roots roots grow out
and you're like, oh yeah,
the anchor is locked in.
- Yep, absolutely, absolutely.
- Yeah, that's amazing.
After seeing the unstoppable robot,
we returned to Elliot's lab a
few years later to see a robot
that has conquered a
totally different specialty,
the art of jumping.
This tiny robot weighs
less than a tennis ball,
and can jump higher than
anything in the world.
In the competitive
world of jumping robots,
the previous record was 3.7 meters,
enough to leap a single story building.
This jumper can reach 31 meters,
higher than a 10-story building.
It could jump all the way from
the Statue of Liberty's feet
up to eye level.
For something to count as a jump,
it must satisfy two criteria.
First, motion must be created
by pushing off the ground.
So a quadcopter doesn't count,
because it pushes off the air.
And second, no mass can be lost.
So rockets constantly ejecting
burnt fuel are not jumping,
and neither is an arrow
launched from a bow.
The bow would have to come with the arrow
for it to count as a jump.
Many animals jump,
from sand fleas, to
grasshoppers, to kangaroos,
and they launch their bodies into the air
with a single stroke of their muscles.
The amount of energy delivered
in that single stroke
determines the jump height.
So if you wanna jump higher,
you have to maximize the
strength of the muscle.
The best jumper in the animal kingdom
is the galago, or bush baby,
and that's because 30% of
their entire muscle mass
is dedicated to jumping.
This allows the squirrel-sized primate
to jump over two meters from a standstill.
- It has like very small
arms and upper body,
and has just like huge jumping legs.
It doesn't have better
muscles or anything,
it just has more of them.
- [Derek] There are some
clever jumping toys.
- I feel like, there we go. Oh!
- I used to play with
these poppers as a kid.
And when you deform a popper,
you store energy in its deformed shape.
Effectively it becomes a spring.
And then, just like an animal,
in one stroke, it applies a
large force to the ground,
launching itself into the air.
All elastic jumpers
follow the same principle
of storing energy in a spring
and releasing that energy
in a single stroke to jump.
But none of the jumping toys we had
could compare to this tiny robot.
Of all the things that I
have ever tried to film,
this is the most challenging.
Because it's so small,
it accelerates rapidly
and travels a huge distance on each jump.
Each takeoff happened faster
than we could even register.
Now, jumping might sound
like a niche skill,
but engineered jumpers would be perfect
for exploring other worlds,
particularly where the atmosphere
is thin or non-existent.
On the moon, with one
sixth the gravity of earth,
this robot would be able
to leap 125 meters high
and half a kilometer forward.
Rovers may struggle with
steep cliffs and deep craters,
but jumpers could hop in and out,
fetching samples to
bring back to the rover.
And you don't lose much
energy when jumping.
So if you could store the kinetic energy
back in the spring on landing,
the efficiency could be near perfect.
The team has already started to build
an entire fleet of jumping robots.
Some of them can right
themselves after landing,
so they can take off again right away.
Others are steerable.
They have three adjustable legs
that allow the jumper to
launch in any direction.
- Essentially what we've done
is we've added three additional
legs that don't store energy
but rather, allow it to
form a tripod sort of
that allows it to point a direction
and launch in that direction.
- [Derek] But how does this
jumping mechanism work?
Well, the main structure consists
of four pieces of carbon fiber,
bound together by elastic bands.
Together, they create a spring
that stores all the energy
needed for the jump.
At the top of the robot is a small motor.
A string wrapped around the axle
is connected to the bottom of the robot.
So when the motor is turned on,
it winds up the string,
compressing the robot,
and this stores energy in the
carbon fiber and rubber bands.
After about a minute and a half,
the structure reaches maximum compression.
How do you know when to put it down?
- Basically once the bottom there
sticks inward and it can stand up,
right now it would roll over,
then you can put it down.
- Got it.
- So as soon as you can.
- [Derek] And at this point,
a trigger releases the latch
that's holding the string on the axle.
So all the string unspools all at once,
and the energy stored in
the spring is released.
- Yeah.
- [Derek] The jumper
goes from a standstill
to over a hundred kilometers an hour
in only nine milliseconds.
That gives an acceleration of over 300 Gs.
That would be enough to kill
basically any living creature.
- Watch out, watch out, watch out.
- But how does it jump
so much higher than everything else,
nearly 10 times higher than
the previous record holder?
Well, this jumper has three
special design features.
First, the jumper is incredibly
light, at just 30 grams.
It achieves this weight by employing
a tiny motor and battery.
Plus, its entire structure,
made of lightweight
carbon fiber and rubber,
doubles as the spring.
Per unit mass, natural latex
rubber can store more energy
than nearly any other elastic material,
7,000 joules per kilogram.
And the design of the spring
makes it ideal for its purpose.
Initially they tried
using only rubber bands
connected to hinged aluminum rods.
But with this design, when compressing it,
the force rises to a
peak and then decreases.
Just feels like it all of a sudden
got a lot easier to pull.
Another design with
only carbon fiber slats
requires a lot of force to get started,
and then it increases linearly after that.
There is more and more
force required to do this.
The ultimate design is a
hybrid of these two approaches.
The benefit being, its
force profile is almost flat
over the entire range of compression.
It feels like that needs a lot of force.
And now it feels pretty steady
with the amount of force
that I need to apply.
Therefore, it provides
double the energy storage
of a typical spring,
where force is proportional
to displacement.
The researchers argue
this is the most efficient
spring ever made.
- Sometimes a string'll snap.
It's not always consistent
that it releases when it's supposed to.
- Oof!
- The string cut it. Lemme go restring it.
I'll be right back.
- [Derek] All right.
You'd probably expect that lighter
would always be better with a jumper,
especially if the added
weight is simply dead weight
rather than anything useful,
like a spring or a motor.
- So we're adding basically a
chunk of steel to our jumper
and it's gonna jump higher,
and the key is that we're
adding it to the top.
You want your body,
the part that's moving,
to weigh at least as much as the foot.
When your body's lighter,
it's basically just collision,
this energy transfer is very inefficient
and you don't jump very high.
- But the real secret to how this jumper
can achieve such heights
is through something
the researchers call work multiplication.
Unlike an animal, which can only jump
using a single stroke of its muscle,
an engineered jumper
can store up the energy
from many strokes,
or in this case, many
revolutions of its motor,
and that's how the motor can be so small.
It doesn't have to deliver
the energy all at once.
It builds it up gradually
over a few minutes.
So the trade-off is kind
of like time for energy.
- [Elliot] Exactly.
- [Derek] And this is possible
because there is a latch under tension
preventing the spring from unspooling
until the robot is fully compressed.
Interestingly, biological
organisms do use latches.
For example, the sand flea,
which can jump incredibly
high for its body size.
- It has a muscle that is
attached, let's say, right here,
is right inside of the pivot point.
So as it contracts that muscle,
the leg doesn't extend, right?
It's actually closing it more.
But then it has a second
muscle that pulls it out.
It's going to shift this muscle
ever so slightly outside the pivot point.
- That's wild.
So there's these two
muscles that are working.
- So here's your big power muscle.
Here's your trigger muscle.
It's a torque reversal mechanism.
And then all of a sudden, it shoots.
- [Derek] But even though the
biological world has latches,
no organism has developed
work multiplication
for a jump from standstill,
at least not internally.
Spider monkeys have been observed
pulling back a branch hand over hand
using multiple muscle strokes
stored in the bend of the branch
to catapult themselves forward.
There's a spider that
shoots out a silky string,
which they pull back multiple times
in order to slingshot
themselves to another location.
So it's like slingshotting itself?
- Yes, they're called
the slingshot spider.
- Now, I tried jumping in moon boots
to see if they would help me go higher.
(remarks drowned out by background noise)
Okay. Oof.
And it certainly felt like they did,
but Elliot pointed out
that from a standing start,
they don't actually help much.
- Kind of build it, build
it, build it, and then go.
- Okay.
Only if you jump a few times
before can you store up
some of the previous jumps
energy in the elastic bands,
and then that energy helps launch you
higher on the following jump.
For years, engineered
jumping was developed
to mimic biological jumping.
But with work multiplication,
it gained an advantage.
If you can generate a
large burst of energy
simply by running a motor for a long time,
the power of the motor is no
longer the limiting factor,
the spring is.
So you can focus on making
the most powerful spring possible.
This jumper has nearly maximized
the achievable height with this spring.
Assuming an infinitely light motor
with infinite time to wind up,
the highest possible jump
with this compression spring
is only around 19% higher
than what they've achieved.
If you want to incorporate air resistance
and play with aerodynamics,
another way to send the jumper higher
is to make it 10 times
isometrically larger,
leading to a 15 to 20% higher jump.
- So we're in kind of
an intermediate scale
where we still are
getting hit by air drag,
but it's not as bad as the flea.
If we went 10 times bigger,
we could actually avoid
air drag completely.
- This works since if
the jumper is scaled up
10 times on all sides,
the cross-sectional area
increases by a hundred,
which increases the drag force,
but the jumper's mass
increases by a thousand.
So it has way more inertia,
meaning the drag force affects it less.
The entire concept of work multiplication
could bring robots to the next level.
Currently, motors and robots
have to be relatively small
so they remain portable.
But the simple principle
of building up the energy
from multiple turns of a motor over time
would allow robots to
store and then release
huge amounts of energy,
and set some world records in the process.
When we visited you, we
were looking at 110 feet
and it was the record holder.
My question, is that still
the record as far as you know?
- It is.
I also challenge all
the viewers to beat it,
because it is beatable.
So I hope someone in the
next few years will beat it,
and if not, we'll beat our own record,
because it's beatable.
I will say that much.
- Are there more happening
with the jumping robots?
- We have a whole nother
project on jumping,
which we also think will beat it,
and it doesn't even use spring.
So I won't give away our secrets yet.
But keep an eye out for that one too,
'cause that's gonna be fun.
- So you have another jumping robot,
which has a totally novel design?
- Yep.
- And you think it's gonna be better
than the one that you had before?
- Correct.
- Wow, that's extreme.
And in terms of making
these things applicable?
- Yeah, so I mean, we do
have a project with NASA.
I will say, our stuff with
NASA moves pretty slow,
just in terms of what
they really care about
is getting something
really, really reliable.
If they're gonna send it to
the moon, it can't mess up.
And so, that's a slow going process.
But I just think that's still a goal,
is to get it to the moon.
- It would be like the next
Mars helicopter or something.
- I think that's a really good analogy.
So the Mars helicopter has
just been doing awesome,
basically being this little scout
that can just go out
and get some nice views
of where the rover might need to go,
or maybe getting some samples.
You can't have a helicopter
on the moon, but you can jump.
And we think we can get
pretty similar performance
in terms of height and stuff like that
with jumping on the moon
compared to the helicopter.
So yeah, no, that's a great analogy.
- Are there any interesting emails
that came about from
the jumping robot video?
- So a lot of people want to make one,
and I will say, it's really hard,
and I keep writing that it's really hard.
Every piece in that robot was...
They talk about safety
factors in engineering
where you're supposed to
have a good safety factor,
and we had no safety factors in anything.
And so, pretty much everything
was near its failure limit.
And so, that just made it incredibly hard.
But what we're trying
to do actually right now
is put together a tutorial to make like a,
you know, it's not gonna
jump a hundred feet,
but it'll jump maybe 20 or 30 feet.
Stay tuned for that,
'cause I think that would
be a fun way to get people
to build one themselves and try it out.
I will say though that if
you really push the limits,
what we're trying to do,
wear your safety glasses and
your gloves, and all of that.
Because the number of
shards of carbon fiber
I've gotten into my fingers.
- Oh, no. Brutal.
What is the biggest thing you learned
building the jumping robot?
- How many things can go wrong
when you're trying to build
something really cool.
'Cause this was years
and years of failing,
over and over, and over and over again.
So I think something that sticks out to me
is that it takes a lot of failure
to get a success like that.
- Would anyone ever say to you,
well, why did it take that many years?
Could you not have
modeled out the springs,
like done some simulations of it
before you actually build the thing?
- Well, no, and I should mention too
that it's not like we didn't
do any modeling or simulation.
That's all part of our cycle too.
But the problem is, I mean, we
didn't even know what shape.
We went through so many different
configurations of robots.
Like some were kind of this ball shape,
but we had other robots
that were more stick like,
rubber band based.
It's like this crazy
search over a huge space,
and comparing all kinds
of different trade offs.
I think that's a reasonable amount of time
to make a world record,
but that's just me.
- The jumper robot can jump so high
precisely because it's built
of rubber and carbon fiber,
with a tiny body and massive legs.
Its whole body is designed
for one physical purpose.
The specialization of robots
is also natural in academic research,
since it's easier for
scientists to isolate
and understand one ability.
These may later be included
into a single more complex robot.
People expect sort of the Boston Dynamics,
humanoid type robots.
Why have you investigated
these sort of other
very strange looking type robots?
- The thing that maybe
unifies all of them is,
they're mostly about
mechanical design, my robots,
and less so about controls, and vision,
and AI, and that side.
And so, often we think of what we do
are kind of adjacent to core robots.
But our lab isn't as focused
on traditional robotics
just because I find more joy
myself in mechanical design.
So that's what I like to do.
- Do you have a personal favorite robot?
- I can't play favorites with my robots.
- I know, it's like picking
amongst your children.
Like it's just impossible.
- I love all my robots.
I love all my robots.
I will say though that the
jumper, there was a certain,
it took a lot of learning
from our failures
and revising it.
And so, when we finally
got that one working,
I think that was really satisfying.
- From your perspective,
how did our collaboration
come to be in the first place?
- Oh, wow.
Okay. That's a fun story.
So you sent me an email, I
don't know how many years ago,
maybe five years ago, something
like this, and I ignored it.
And I went into lab one day, I
just mentioned to my student,
I was like, oh, some guy
emailed about making a video.
And he is like, "Yeah, who was it?
Maybe I could help out or something."
So I forwarded it to him, he's like,
"Do you know who this is?"
So then we responded.
And we appreciated the effort you put in
to the details in getting the story right.
I forget how long we had this call.
I had this call with Emily,
it was maybe four hours or something.
We went through the
details of jumping theory.
'Cause she wanna get everything just right
for that jumping video.
As an academic, we care about that stuff
and we want it to be right.
- But the most specialized perfected match
between a robot's build in its abilities
comes from one competition
that's been refining this
for nearly 50 years.
Micromouse is the oldest robotics
competition in the world.
It's like the Formula 1 of robotics,
but you have to see their
speed to believe it.
This tiny robot mouse can finish this maze
in just six seconds.
(rousing music)
Every year around the world,
people compete in the
oldest robotics race.
The goal is simple:
get to the end of the
maze as fast as possible.
- Person who came second
(spectators cheering)
lost by 20 milliseconds.
- [Derek] But competition
has grown fierce.
- When somebody saw my design,
they said, you're crazy.
- [Derek] Why is there so much tension?
What's riding on it?
Honor?
- Honor.
(spectators applauding)
- [Derek] In 1952,
mathematician Claude Shannon
constructed an electronic
mouse named Theseus
that could solve a maze.
The trick to making the mouse intelligent
was hidden in a computer
built into the maze itself,
made of telephone relay switches.
The mouse was just a magnet
on wheels essentially,
following an electromagnet
controlled by the position
of the relay switches.
- [Claude] He is now exploring the maze
using a rather involved
strategy of trial and error.
As he finds the correct path,
he registers the
information in his memory.
Later, I can put him down
in any part of the maze
that he's already explored
and he'll be able to
go directly to the goal
without making a single false turn.
- Theseus is often referred to
as one of the first examples
of machine learning.
A director at Google recently said
that it inspired the whole field of AI.
25 years later, editors at
the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE,
caught wind of a contest
for electronic mice,
or le mouse electronique,
as they had heard.
They were ecstatic.
Were these the successors Theseus?
But something had been
lost in translation.
These mice were just batteries in cases,
not robots capable of
intelligent behavior.
But the misunderstanding stuck
with them, and they wondered,
why couldn't we hold that
competition ourselves?
In 1977, the announcement for IEEE's
amazing Micromouse Maze Contest
attracted over 6,000 entrants.
But the number of successful
competitors dwindled rapidly.
Eventually, just 15 entrants
reached the finals in 1979.
But by this point, the
contest had garnered
enough public interest to be broadcast
nationwide on the evening news.
And just like the rumor that
inspired the competition,
Micromouse began to
spread across the world.
♪ Micromouse for the taking ♪
♪ Micromouse, it's here and now ♪
♪ Take a chance and start creating ♪
- The Micromouse.
- [All] Micromouse!
(upbeat music)
- Even people in the top two or three,
you can see them trying
to set their mice up,
and they can barely find
the buttons to press
because it's absolutely nerve wracking.
(suspenseful music)
It doesn't matter what it was.
It could be horse racing,
it could be motor racing,
it could be mouse racing.
If you have a shred of
competitiveness in you,
you wanna win, right?
- [Derek] Just like a real mouse,
a micromouse has to be fully autonomous,
no internet connection,
no GPS or remote control,
and no nudging it to help it get unstuck.
It has to fit all its computing, motors,
sensors, and power supply
in a frame no longer or
wider than 25 centimeters.
There isn't a limit on
the height of the mouse,
but the rules don't
allow climbing, flight,
or any forms of combustion.
So rocket propulsion for
example, is out of the equation.
(whistle being blown)
The maze itself is a square
about three meters on each side,
subdivided by walls
into corridors only 18 centimeters across.
And in 2009,
the half-size Micromouse
category was introduced,
with mice smaller than 12 and
a half centimeters per side,
and paths just nine centimeters across.
The final layout of the
maze is only revealed
at the start of each competition,
after which competitors are not allowed
to change the code in their mice.
(spectators applauding)
The big three competitions,
all Japan, Taiwan,
and USA's APEC, usually limit
the time mice get in the maze
to seven or 10 minutes,
and mice are only allowed five runs
from the start to the goal.
- So if you spend a lot of time
searching, that's a penalty.
- Makes sense.
So the strategy for most micromice
is to spend their first run
carefully learning the maze
and looking for the best path to the goal,
while not wasting too much time.
Then they use their remaining tries
to sprint down that path for
the fastest runtime possible.
(spectators applauding)
Solving a maze may sound simple enough,
though it's important to remember
that with only a few
infrared sensors for eyes,
the view from inside the
maze is a lot less clear
than what we see from above.
Still, you can solve a
maze with your eyes closed.
If you just put one hand along one wall,
you will eventually reach
the end of most common mazes,
and that's exactly what some initial
Micromouse competitors realized too.
And after a simple wall following mouse
took home gold in the first finals,
the goal of the maze was
moved away from the edges
and freestanding walls were added,
which would leave a simple
wall following mouse
searching forever.
Your next instinct might
be to run through the maze
taking note of every fork in the road.
Whenever you reach a dead end or a loop,
you can go back to the last intersection
and try a different path.
If your last left turn got you nowhere,
you'd come back to that
intersection and go right instead.
You can think of this strategy
as the one a headstrong mouse might use,
running as deep into the maze as it can
and turning back only when
it can't go any further.
This search strategy, known
as depth-first search,
will eventually get the mouse to the goal.
The problem is, it might
not be the shortest route,
because the mouse only
turns back when it needs to,
so it may have missed a
shortcut that it never tried.
The sibling to this search
algorithm, breath-first search,
would find the shortest path.
With this strategy, the
mouse runs down one branch
of an intersection until
it reaches the next one,
and then it goes back to
check the path it skipped
before moving on to the
next layer of intersections.
So the mouse checks
every option it reaches,
but all that backtracking
means that it's rerunning
paths dozens of times.
At this point, even
searching the whole maze
often takes less time.
So why not just do that?
A meticulous mouse could search
all 256 cells of the maze,
testing every turn and corner
to ensure it has definitely
found the shortest path.
But searching so thoroughly
isn't necessary either.
Instead, the most popular
Micromouse strategy
is different from all of these techniques.
It's a search algorithm
known as flood-fill.
This mouse's plan is to
make optimistic journeys
through the maze, so optimistic in fact,
that on their first journey
their map of the maze
doesn't have any walls at all.
They simply draw the shortest
path to the goal and go.
When their optimistic plan
inevitably hits a wall
that wasn't on their map,
they simply mark it down
and update their new
shortest path to the goal.
Running, updating,
running, updating,
always bee lining for the goal.
Under the hood of the algorithm,
what the micromouse is
marking on their map
is the distance from every
square in the maze to the goal.
To travel optimistically,
the mouse follows the trail
of decreasing numbers down to zero.
Whenever they hit a wall,
they update the numbers on their map
to reflect the new shortest
distance to the goal.
This strategy of following
the numerical path
of lease resistance gives the
flood-fill algorithm its name.
The process resembles
flooding the maze with water
and updating values based on the flow.
Once the mouse reaches the goal,
it can smooth out the path it took
and get a solution to the maze.
However, it may look back and imagine
an even shorter uncharted
path it could've taken.
The mouse might not be satisfied
that it's found the
shortest path just yet.
While this algorithm isn't guaranteed
to find the best path on first pass,
it takes advantage of
the fact that micromice
need to return to the start
to begin their next run.
So if the mouse treats its
return as a new journey,
it can use the return trip
to search the maze as well.
Between these two attempts, both optimized
to find the shortest path
from start to finish,
it's extremely likely that
the mouse will discover it,
and the mouse will have
done it efficiently,
often leaving irrelevant areas of the maze
entirely untouched.
Flood-fill offers both an
intelligent and practical way
for micromice to find the
shortest path through the maze.
Once there was a clear strategy
to find the shortest path,
and once the microcontrollers
and sensors required to
implement it became common,
some people believed
Micromouse had run its course.
As a paper published in IEEE put it,
"At the end of the 1980s,
the Micromouse Contest
had outlived itself.
The problem was solved
and did not provide any new challenges."
In the 2017 all-Japan
Micromouse competition,
both the bronze and silver placing mice
found the shortest path to the goal.
And once they did, they
were able to zip along it
as quick as 7.4 seconds.
(spectators applauding)
But Masakazu Utsunomiya's
winning mouse, Red Comet,
did something entirely different.
This is the shortest path to the goal,
the one that everyone took.
This is the path that Red Comet took.
It's a full five and a half meters longer.
That's because micromice aren't actually
searching for the shortest path,
they're searching for the fastest path,
and Red Comet's search
algorithm figured out
that this path had fewer
turns to slow it down.
So even though the path was longer,
it could end up being faster.
So it took that risk.
(spectators applauding)
It won by 131 milliseconds.
Differing routes at competition
are now more common than not,
and even just getting to
the goal remains difficult,
whether due to a mysterious algorithm
or a quirk of the physical maze.
- [Announcer] On the corner,
it's a little bit like a, whoa.
- [Derek] Micromice don't
always behave as you'd expect.
Micromouse is far from solved,
because it's not just a software problem
or a hardware problem, it's
both, it's a robotics problem.
Red Comet didn't win
because it had a better search algorithm,
or because it had faster motors.
It's cleverness came from how the brains
and body of the mouse interacted together.
- So it turns out solving
the maze is not the problem,
it never was the problem, right?
But it's actually about navigation,
and it's about going fast.
- Every year, the robots get
smaller, faster, lighter.
There is still plenty of innovation left.
And there's a small group
of devotees in Japan
busy building quarter-sized micromouse,
which would sit on a quarter
- [Derek] Nearly 50 years on,
Micromouse is bigger than ever.
(spectators applauding)
Competitions have appeared
solved at first glance before.
The high jump was an
Olympic sport since 1896,
with competitors refining their jumps
using variations like the
scissor, the western roll,
and the straddle over the
decades with diminishing returns.
But once foam padding became
standard in competition,
Dick Fosbury rewrote the sport in 1968
by becoming the first Olympian
to jump over the pole backwards.
Now almost every high jumper
does what's known as the Fosbury Flop.
If Micromouse had indeed
stopped in the 1980s,
the competition would've
missed its own Fosbury flops,
two innovations that completely
changed how micromice ran.
After all, a lot can change in a sport
where competitors can solder on
any upgrade they can imagine.
The first Fosbury flop
was one of the earliest
innovations in Micromouse,
and had nothing to do with technology.
It was simply a way of
thinking outside the box,
or rather, cutting through the box.
Every mouse used to
turn corners like this.
But everything changed
with the mouse, Mitee 3.
- The Mitee mouse three
implemented diagonals for the first time.
(spectators cheering)
And that turned out to
be a much better idea
than we really thought.
And because it's cool, maze designers
often put diagonals into the maze now.
So, you know, you could end
up with a maze where it never
comes up, but most of the
time, it's actually a benefit.
- [Derek] In order to pull off diagonals,
the chassis of the mouse had to be reduced
to less than 11 centimeters wide,
or just five centimeters
for half-size Micromouse.
The sensors and software of
the mouse had to change too.
When you're running
between parallel walls,
all you have to do is
maintain an equal distance
between your left and
right infrared readings.
But a diagonal requires
an entirely new algorithm,
one that essentially guides the mouse
as if it had blinders on.
- Normally if you're going
along the side of a wall
or something like that,
most of the time, you can
see the wall all the time.
And so, that helps you to guide yourself,
and you know when you're getting off.
But in the diagonal situation,
you just see these walls coming at you.
- [Derek] And if you veer
even a tiny bit off course,
snagging a corner is a lot less forgiving
than sliding against a wall.
Diagonals are still one of
the biggest sources of crashes
in competition today.
But in exchange, a jagged path of turns
transforms into one narrow straightaway.
- Whoa, whoa!
(spectators applauding)
(spectators applauding)
(spectators cheering)
- [Derek] These days, nearly
every competitive micromouse
is designed to take this risk.
Cutting diagonals opened up
room for even more ideas.
Around the same time,
mice were applying similar
strategies to turning.
Instead of stopping and pivoting
through two right turns,
a mouse could sweep around
in a single U-turn motion.
And once the possibility
of diagonals were added,
the total number of possible
turns opened up exponentially.
The maze was no longer just
a grid of square hallways.
With so many more options to weigh,
figuring out the best path
became more complex than ever.
But the payoff was dramatic.
What was once a series of stops and starts
could now be a single
fluid snaking motion.
How micromice imagined
and moved through the maze
had changed completely.
(spectators applauding)
Available technology was getting upgrades
over the years as well.
Tall and unwieldy arms that
were used to find walls
were replaced by a smaller array
of infrared sensors onboard the mouse.
Precise stepper motors were traded in
for continuous DC motors and encoders.
- The DC motors give you more power
for less size and weight.
And so, we were interested in doing that.
So then you have to have a servo,
you have to actually have
feedback on the motor
to make it do the right thing.
- [Derek] Gyroscopes added an
extra sense of orientation.
It's like a compass.
- Absolutely.
- You had this thing with you.
- They came about 'cause
of mobile phones, really.
So the technology provides people
with things which weren't there before.
All of the turning is
done based off the gyro,
rather than counting
pulses off the wheels,
'cause it's much more reliable.
- [Derek] But even with all
the mechanical upgrades,
the biggest physical issue for micromice
went unaddressed for decades.
One thing you'll see almost
every competitor holding
is a roll of tape.
Once you know to look for
it, you'll see it everywhere.
This tape isn't for repairs
or reattaching fallen parts.
It's to gather specks
of dust off the wheels
in between rounds.
At the speed and precision
these robots are operating,
that tiny change in friction
is enough to ruin a run.
If you wanna turn while driving fast,
you need centripetal force to
accelerate you into the turn.
And the faster you're moving,
the more force you need
to keep you on the track.
The only centripetal force for
a car turning on flat ground
is friction, which is
determined by two things,
the road pushing up the weight of the car,
or the normal force,
multiplied by the static
coefficient of friction,
which is the friction of the interface
between the tire and road surface.
This is why racetracks have banked turns.
The steep angles help cars
turn with less friction,
because part of the normal
force itself now points in
to contribute to the
centripetal force required.
If the bank turn is steep enough,
cars can actually make the turn
without any friction at all.
The inward component of
the normal force alone
is enough to provide the centripetal force
required to stay on track.
Micromice are no different,
and they don't have banked turns to help.
As they got faster and
faster, by the early 2000s,
their limiting factor was no longer speed,
but control of that speed.
They had to set their
center of gravity low
and slow down during turns
to avoid slipping into
a wall or flipping over.
But unlike race cars, there
wasn't anything in the rules
to stop Micromouse competitors
from solving this problem
by engineering an entirely new mechanism.
Micromouse's second Fosbury flop
was almost considered a gimmick
when the mouse Mokomo08
first used it in competition.
You might be staring at
the video to try to see it,
but you won't.
Instead, it's something you'll hear.
That isn't the mouse revving its engines.
It's spinning up a propeller.
And while flying over the
walls is against the rules,
there's nothing in the
rules against a mouse
vacuuming itself to the
ground to prevent slipping.
- Dave Otten was the first person
I saw put a fan on a mouse,
but he used a ducted fan,
and I think he was really looking
at kind of reaction force,
blowing the thing down.
He had a skirt around, but it
was not terribly effective.
He'll forgive for saying so.
The idea is to let as
little air in as possible.
And like your vacuum cleaner,
when you block your vacuum cleaner,
the motor unloads and speeds
up, and so the current drops.
But if you let too much air
in, the current's very high.
And these are just quadcopter motors,
and they draw a lot of current.
- [Derek] At the scale of Micromouse,
a vacuum fan, often just built
from handheld drone parts,
is enough to generate a downward force
five times the mouse's weight.
Wow, okay. That's impressive.
So how much does the car actually weigh?
- About 130 grams.
And if you listen,
I dunno if you'll get it
on your microphone, but.
- Oh, yeah.
- You hear the motors
slow down, loads up.
- [Derek] With that much friction,
micromice today can turn corners
with a centripetal
acceleration approaching 6 Gs.
That's the same as F1 cars.
Once nearly everyone equipped fans,
the added control allowed builders
to push the speed limit on micromice.
- When it's allowed to,
it will out accelerate a Tesla Roadster,
but not for very far.
- [Derek] And they can zip along
at up to seven meters per second,
faster than most people can run.

Every one of the features now standard
on the modern micromouse
was once an experiment,
and the next Fosbury flop
might not be far off.
The first four-wheeled micromouse
to win the all-Japan
competition did so in 1988,
but it would take another 22 years
of the winning mouse growing
and losing appendages
before four wheeled mice became the norm.
With micromice still experimenting
in six and eight wheeled designs,
omnidirectional movement,
and even computer vision,
who knows what the next
paradigm shift will be.
- [Announcer] Your time on
the maze actually begins
only when you leave the start square.
So he's not penalized
for any of this time.
- But if you wanna get
started with Micromouse,
you don't need to worry about wheel count,
or vacuum fans, or even diagonals.
- It is to my mind,
the perfect combination
of all the major disciplines
that you need for robotics,
and engineering, and
programming, embedded systems,
all wrapped up in one accessible bundle
that you can do in your living room,
and you don't need a laboratory to run it.
You come along because you're curious.
And then you think, I could do that,
that doesn't look so hard.
And then you're doomed, really.
If it sucks you in, it turns
into quite the journey.
(spectators cheering)
(spectators applauding)
- At its core, Micromouse
is just about a mouse
trying to solve a maze.
Though nearly 50 years later,
it's a simple problem
that's a good reminder,
there is no such thing
as a simple problem.

- A humanoid robot
built for all the same tasks a human does
sacrifices specialization in any one skill
in order to be a generalist.
But if it does all tasks semi well
and these tasks are what
humans are already doing,
well, then those robots are
just overlapping with us,
copying our capacities
rather than expanding them.
So robots are perhaps
likely to enter our lives
not as multipurpose humanoids,
but rather as precise tools
we can pick and choose.
Instead of one Swiss army knife robot,
you'd end up with something
like a personalized toolbox
of specialized robots.
Big futuristic questions
like how to bring robots
into our daily lives
requires all sorts of
practical and creative skills.
But perhaps the most important one
is actually something

So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this part of the video,
and now, dive into a surprising trait
we're starting to build into robots.
Elliot's vine robot and jumping robot
are just two cases where the robots
that might save our lives
or explore new planets
don't look much like
traditional robots at all.
But soft robots in particular
are an entire field of study.
So why are so many
researchers trying to build
the robots of the future
with soft materials?
For one, trading out
fragmented metal frames
for single flexible bodies
might be how we make robots
more reliable and precise.
These bendy gear boards are so predictable
that they were commissioned
by the US government
to secure nuclear weapons,
ensuring that no random motions
could accidentally set them off.
But predictability is
just one of eight reasons
that machines that bend are better.
What do this satellite
thruster, plastic tool,
and micro mechanical
switch have in common?
Well, they all contain
components that bend,
so-called compliant mechanisms.
- So it's always been considered to be bad
to have flexibility in your machines.
Well, we've tried to take that
thing that everybody hates
and is trying to avoid and say,
how can we use flexibility
to our advantage,
how can we use that to do cool stuff?
- [Derek] Now, Professor
Howell literally wrote the book
on compliant mechanisms.
- That's the most cited book in--
- [Derek] But he's pretty
nonchalant about his work.
Just watch how he introduces
this mechanism he developed
to prevent nuclear weapons
from going off accidentally.
- Actually the safing and
arming of nuclear weapons.
- [Derek] What?
- And so, yeah, if you want.
- [Derek] Hang on, hang on.
Hang on, hang on.
What in nuclear weapons?
- Safing and arming.
- Safing and arming.
- Yeah.
So if there's anything in the world
that you want to be safe,
that is not going to accidentally go off.
- I feel like this is, it
doesn't even need saying.
But yes, nuclear weapons,
obviously you don't want them to go off.
Well, I don't understand how this
is gonna keep nuclear weapons safe.
Now, I wanna come back to this device
and explain how it works.
Once we understand why
compliant mechanisms
are best suited to this task.
That's cool.
So let's start with something basic.
- Probably the first compliant
mechanism I ever designed
was this thing.
What it is, is a compliant
mechanism that is a gripper.
So you can put something in there
and it'll get actually
a really high force.
I can put that in there
and it breaks the chalk.
- [Derek] What if you
put your finger in there
and squeeze it?
- You would scream in pain.
Would you like to try?
- I would.
- Okay.
- [Derek] Like I would actually
like to feel the force.
- Okay.
You need to squeeze it yourself though.
- Really?
- Well, all right, I'll squeeze
'til you scream in pain.
- But like don't, don't, don't.
(Derek screaming in pain)
That very quickly got incredibly painful.
It felt like having my
finger like in a vice.
- That looks suspiciously like vice grips,
but now with these flexible
components where the hinges are.
- Hmm.
What I learned in my visit
with Professor Howell
is that compliant mechanisms
have a number of advantages
over traditional mechanisms.
But I thought he needed kind of a clever,
pithy way to remember
all of these advantages.
So I came up with the eight
P's of compliant mechanisms,
and the first of those is part count.
Compliant mechanisms
have reduced part count,
because they have these bendy parts
instead of having things like hinges,
and bearings, and separate springs.
This gripper is just a
single piece of plastic,
but achieves a similar result
to the much more complicated vice grips.
Like how much does it amplify the force?
- This will get about 30 to 1.
So I could get, for 1 pound
force in, get 30 pounds out.
- [Derek] That's pretty good.
It seems like that would be super cheap.
- And really inexpensive.
So this we just made here in our shop,
but you can imagine also
injection molding now.
- [Derek] That would cost like cents.
- Yep, this would cost cents.
The other thing is, because of its shape,
you could extrude it and
then just chop 'em off.
- Hmm.
- And that would be cool.
- So the simple allows different
production processes to be
used, which lowers the price.
These switches, for example,
achieve in one piece of plastic
what is normally done
with springs, hinges,
and many rigid plastic pieces.
- Also a good fidget device.
- How long can these last?
- We've had these in our
fatigue testing machine,
and we've been able to go
over a million cycles without failure.
- What do we got there?
- All right, Derek, I've got a quiz.
- Uh-oh.
- A quiz for you, okay?
- Elephant.
- Very good.
Okay, I'm gonna push on the
elephant's rump, this direction.
I'm gonna hold this.
So that little dot right there,
is that dot, when I push on it,
is it gonna go left, right, up, or down?
(Derek laughing)
- I just, you know what,
I wanted to guess without
even thinking about it.
- Yeah, please do.
- I'm gonna say like up and in.
- Okay. Up and in.
- And I kind of feel like that
because like that would be a logical way
for an elephant to hold its trunk.
But also because like if
this is all going over,
I feel like this is gonna
kind of extend there
and that's gonna get pushed up in there.
- Ah, ah, good thinking.
- Well, I don't know,
is that good thinking?
- Well, it's thinking at least.
So this is designed so
that when you push on that,
it actually just rotates in
space, it doesn't move at all.
- I knew you were gonna pull some sort of
trick question on me.
- It's a trick question.
- [Derek] Now, since I was fooled by it,
I had to try it out on my
friend, The Physics Girl.
- That's so trippy.
That is so cool.
I don't understand, what?
- It's modeled after the
mechanisms you use in wind tunnels
where you want to have, say,
a model that's attached here,
but then you move it
and all you want to do
is control, its its angle
and not move it around in the wind tunnel.
- Don't displace it, but be
able to change the angle.
Devices like this demonstrate
that compliant mechanisms
are capable of producing
very precise motion,
which I personally found
pretty counterintuitive
because these objects are
made up of flexible parts.
But maybe that shouldn't be surprising,
because compliant mechanisms
don't suffer from backlash, for one thing.
So backlash occurs when you have a hinge,
which is basically just a pin in a hole,
and it's moving in one direction.
And now, if at some point
the motion reverses,
it doesn't happen instantaneously
because there's some give in the hinge.
This also causes wear,
and requires lubricant.
And that is why compliant mechanisms
have better performance than
their traditional counterparts.
- This one though is my favorite.
- That is one of my favorites too.
It's just so pleasing, right?
- Oh, that sound is so satisfying.
- This actually, believe
it or not, was inspired
when we were doing things
at the microscopic level,
where we were building
compliant mechanisms on chips.
We had to be able to make
these compliant mechanisms
out of silicon, which
is as brittle as glass.
And if you're trying to
make something like this
out of glass, it's crazy hard.
But that also means, once
we figured out the design,
we could make it in a
material even like PLA,
which is also not the ideal
compliant mechanism material.
So you can get on our website
and get the files to make this yourself.
- [Derek] I'll put a
link in the description.
- Yeah, that also has a nice
feel, and a nice snap to it.
- It has a really nice snap.
I like when it comes out, it's like gunk.
Like there's something
about that that's really,
it's very pleasing.
So these things actually move?
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- [Derek] I need to see this.
- Okay, all right, we'll do it.
- [Derek] Were those etched on there?
- Yeah, those are etched.
And so, just using the same processes
used to make computer chips.
- [Derek] So another advantage
of compliant mechanisms
is that they can be made
with significantly smaller proportions,
because they take advantage
of production processes
like photolithography.
- [Larry] And we have motion that we want
at the microscopic level.
- That's brilliant.
Plus, since they simplify design,
compliant mechanisms
are much more portable,
meaning lightweight,
which makes them perfect
for space applications.
- This here is something we did with NASA,
making a hinge that could replace bearings
for, say, deploying solar panels.
This is titanium, 3D-printed titanium.
But what's freaky about it is,
you get that motion, which people expect,
but here's a piece of
titanium that can bend
plus-minus 90 degrees,
180 degree deflection.
- [Derek] That is solid titanium?
- That is one piece of
titanium that is 3D printed.
- [Derek] There's no alloy,
nothing to make it flexible?
- Yep, this is, yep.
And even freakier than this
is this guy right there.
So that looks like a crazy beast,
but every part in there has a purpose.
All these flexible beams.
Here are the two inputs.
And again, we did this with
NASA for a thruster application,
where we can put a thruster right there,
and now, with our two motor inputs,
we can direct that
thruster in any direction.
That titanium device moves out,
and you notice, it's just all bending.
And then, there's no pinch
points for the fuel lines,
or electrical lines coming in.
- Here, this single piece of titanium
allows you to use one
thruster in place of two.
Okay, that is a clutch.
- Okay.
- So the idea is, if you
spin it up really fast,
because it's flexible,
this outer part will actually
start coming outwards.
And then, if there's a drum around it,
it'll contact with that
drum and spin that thing.
- Oh, so this like kind of,
oh, that kind of comes out like so.
- Then it gets spinning really fast,
and then you essentially
engage this outer drum.
So this is like the way
that a chainsaw would work,
or something like that,
because you get it spinning fast enough
and then it engages the chain,
and then it turns it over
and then, yeah.
- The centripetal force.
Yeah. Wow, that's cool.
- So here, this is made in
plastic so that you can see it.
But in reality, it's
gotta be a lot stiffer.
So here it is made in steel.
- What?
So hang on, you're saying that that thing,
which is made of steel,
- Yep.
- you spin it up to a certain speed,
and then it expands and engages
a drum that's around it?
- Yep, yep.
So it'll idle with no motion,
but then at a certain speed,
what we designed it for,
it'll speed up to that RPM.
- You speed it up and it engage?
- Yep.
- I had no idea.
Like I have learned something today.
So let's come back to the
safing and arming device
for nuclear weapons.
Its purpose is to ensure
that no random vibrations,
say, from an earthquake,
inadvertently disable safeties
and arm the nuclear weapon.
Now, one of the requirements
was that this device
be made as small as possible.
- They made those as small
as they possibly could
using traditional
methods, even using things
like what the Swiss watch
manufacturers were using.
- With compliant mechanisms,
they produced a device out
of hardened stainless steel
where some components were
the size of a human hair.
This is high speed video.
Here, the device is operating at 72 hertz,
meaning this little hole
makes two complete
revolutions each second.
The way it's meant to
work is an arming laser
shines on the rotor wheel,
and when the proper input
is given to the system,
the wheel rotates a notch.
If all the proper inputs are given,
then the hole lines up with a laser beam
and crazy things happen from there.
So it is essential that
this device's performance
is perfectly predictable,
even if it sits unused
in a silo for decades.
- So are these now being
used on nuclear weapons?
- You know, it turns
out they don't tell us
what they do with their nuclear weapons.
And so, we designed
them, we made prototypes,
we tested them,
and then it goes what
they call behind the fence
where it's all classified,
and you know, we don't
know what happens, so.
- But these soft components by themselves
aren't truly robots.
It's only once you combine
them with computers
that you get robots which
can autonomously form
crazy shapes or new styles of movement,
all because they bend.
But how do they work,
and why would you want a soft
robot in the first place?
So I came up to Stanford
to meet Zach Hammond
and his soft robot.
- Hey, Derek.
- How's it going?
- [Derek] All right, you wanna tip it?
So is the idea that the
robot could walk this way?
- Totally, yeah.
So you can kinda chain
these roles together
to kind of roll around in any environment.
They call this punctuated
rolling locomotion,
wherein it's kind of stuck on a face
until it tips over, and
now it's on a new face,
and it can then continue to
move its center of gravity.
Once that center of gravity
exits the support polygon
or the base, then it tips over
one of the edges of the face.
- [Derek] This is a different soft robot
made out of flexible tubing.
It was designed to mimic
the way a turtle walks,
where diagonally opposite
legs move together.
It's powered entirely by compressed air,
and perhaps most impressive,
it requires no electronics.
All of the circuitry is pneumatic.
And this means the robot can
be used in places like mines,
where electronics could spark explosions,
or in the strong magnetic
fields around MRI machines.
But why would you want a soft
robot in the first place?
- One of the things that I like to do
is just to take the robot
and kind of like beat it up a little bit,
show how it's compliant and compressive.
- [Derek] Well, because they're safer.
- If you'd like to take
a whack at it, feel free.
- But this is your work.
I don't wanna break it obviously.
- No, feel free. Go for it.
- For operation around humans,
there's not much damage a
soft robot can do to you.
I can stand on these?
- Yep.
- This is a pretty crazy compliant robot.
- Because the fundamental structure
of this robot is compliant,
there's only some maximum force
that it could ever exert on me.
So it's inherently safe to
be operating around people.
- [Derek] Could we make it
fall and have me be inside it?
- Yeah, yeah, we could do that for sure.
Just watch your head.
- Yep. If I go over here.
- If you're there, yeah, we can do that.
- All right, let's try it.
Here it comes.
Well, that's not bad at all, is it?
- [Zach] I can try another shape
that's supposed to open
up one of the faces
so you can jump out of it quickly.
- Okay.
- [Zach] I haven't tested
it in a little while,
so I dunno how it's gonna
go, but let's try this.
There you go, that's it.
Face right there to your right,
and you can exit the truss from that face.
- Boom, just that easy.
- Perfect.
- [Derek] Did you build this by yourself?
- Me and one other grad student
built this entire thing
ourselves basically.
- [Derek] And how long did it take?
- [Zach] We did it in about
a month, I want to say,
like actually constructing everything.
- [Derek] And was it tricky?
I mean, were you sewing that stuff?
- Yep, we sewed this all ourselves.
- [Derek] The main structural
members of this robot
are fabric tubes inflated with air.
- Yeah. So these red
tubes are a nylon fabric,
and then internally there
is a polyethylene tube
that provides the air tightness.
- [Derek] The tubes are inflated
to about six PSI above atmospheric.
So it's almost one and a half atmospheres.
Each tube passes through pairs of rollers
connected to a motor.
The rollers pinch the tube so it bends
kinda like a pinched straw.
- Have the rods,
and then we have this like
high friction material
wrapped around the rods.
And then that coupled with the fact
that we have this pressurized
tube that's kinda pushing
the membrane of the tube into the rollers
prevents us from slipping.
- [Derek] By driving the motor,
it changes the lengths of the tubes.
- Kind of like when a clown
creates a twist in a balloon
and then folds that balloon
into a balloon animal.
The difference between what
the clown does and what we do
is that there's some passage of air
between adjacent segments of the tube,
so that as the robot drives around,
we're not pressurizing
the segments of the tube.
- [Derek] This robot is
made of four inflated tubes,
each one connected to a pair of motors,
forming triangular sides.
- We also think that they kind
of look like sausage links
when put together, which is
why we've named these robots
after different sausages.
So this one's called Polish.
That one over there is Chorizo.
There's a Linguica, and a
Kielbasa over there somewhere.
- [Derek] So what shape
is the overall thing?
It's an octahedron?
- Yeah, we call it an octahedron,
because if you drew lines
between these kind of
kinematic joints here,
it would create an octahedron shape.
- Driving the motors
together allows the robot
to dramatically change shape.
It can get very tall, or short and squat.
But since the tubes themselves
don't change in length,
the overall perimeter of the robot,
the length of all the edges
combined, doesn't change.
So the robot is considered isoperimetric.
How do you feel when you watch
those Boston Dynamics videos?
- Oh, I love those
videos. They're so cool.
- The Boston Dynamics robots
are kind of terrifying.
Like isn't the idea with soft robots
to like convince people that
robots are good, and soft,
and kind, and friendly, and safe?
- That's that's definitely true, yeah.
There are some things that
you can do to rigid systems
to make them feel like compliant systems
based on how you're
controlling the motors.
But yeah, they're
definitely heavy, expensive,
and can be dangerous if
they're not used correctly.
- [Derek] The hard robots we're used to
are strong and precise.
Their actions are accurate and repeatable,
but they are also heavy,
and they can't really change
their volume as dramatically.
But this robot is still capable
of carrying a heavy load.
- So I have a GUI in MATLAB
- Oh, nice.
- that enables me to just put in
the positions that I want
the robots to move in inches
and then send them out.
There's some other functionality.
I have some stored configurations
to send to the robots.
- [Derek] Soft robots
also have the advantage
of shape changing.
They can become tall to go over obstacles,
or short to fit under obstructions.
- So if there's some
rock that it didn't see,
or that it wanted to roll
over, it could simply do that,
and the compliance of the tubes
would simply just bend
around that disturbance.
- Do you imagine robots like
this doing work in space?
- Oh yeah, definitely.
So one of the nice things
about these types of structures
is that they can shrink down
their volume very drastically.
And because volume on rockets
is such an expensive premium,
being able to have a robot
that can pack down small for
transport is very valuable.
So NASA was at one point
looking into trust robots
for exactly that reason.
And they've contacted us
since we've made this robot
to explore different ideas for
space exploration projects.
So one of the things that
they're thinking about doing
is deploying robots
underneath a sheet of ice.
So they're gonna drill
through this sheet of ice
and then deposit a robot
through what is kind of
a small diameter hole.
And so, if you can have a robot
that can change its
volume very drastically,
or be disassembled and then reassembled
to form a much larger structure,
then you can have large robots
that are able to fit
through these tight spaces
and be deployed in
difficult to access areas.
- Is this a little bit like an octopus?
Is that how you can think of it?
- There is some connection there,
because they use their
shape changing ability
and their compliance to squeeze
through tight passageways,
and then also to wrap
their body around objects.
So for example, they can open
jars with their tentacles.
And one of the things that
we want to use this robot for
is grasping and manipulating objects.
- [Derek] This robot is even capable
of picking objects up off the ground.
- We'll try that and
see if it can grab it.
Because of the compliance of the tubes,
it has a natural ability to
grasp and manipulate objects,
because as it does so, the
tubes bend ever so slightly,
which increases the contact area
and distributes evenly the forces
that are exerted on that object.
- [Derek] So I mean, is the
biggest risk if it pops?
- Yeah, that's a big risk.
I mean, you obviously
need the compressed air
for your structure.
And so, if you have a leak.
(air whooshing)
Oh.
Then you don't have a robot, right?
- [Derek] It's a pretty big
drawback of soft robots.
- Some things that you
could do to mitigate that
would be to have onboard
a small compressor,
which isn't there to
provide power to the robot,
but would help you maintain pressure
if there were any small leaks.
- [Derek] When you tell someone
you're working on a robot
and they see this, does
it defy expectations?
- Totally.
They have no idea what
it is I'm talking about
until I show them like
a video or a picture.
I think most people's
conception of soft robots
was really expanded by
the movie "Big Hero 6."
And I think they did a great job
in kind of showcasing
what a soft robot can do
and why they're useful,
and kind of just popularizing the notion.
It's really great to have compliance
built into any mechanical system,
especially as we want robots
to work closer and closer with humans.
So I think we'll definitely see more
soft robots in the future.
- So maybe robots will
enter our daily lives
sooner than we think,
just not in multipurpose humanoid form.
In fact, one specialty robot
is already becoming widespread,
the glorious Roomba, built
for maximum vacuuming.
Do you think the way that robots
integrate themselves into our lives
will be like a humanoid
robot in your house,
or will it be specialized little things
that we don't even think of
as robots but they sort of?
- Slowly infiltrate, yeah.
I think probably the latter
is gonna happen first,
would be my guess.
I mean, little things like, yeah,
like things just start getting smarter,
whether it's your shoes,
your watch, or your car,
your thermostat, all those things,
and then before like your
maid shows up as a robot.
- By dropping the human model of a robot,
instead we can choose
the best possible shapes
and materials that maximize
specific abilities.
And with this method,
we've already built robots
that can save your life,
leap tall buildings in a single bound,
move with super speed,
protect your valuables,
and shapeshift.
You know, come to think of it,
they'd make a pretty good superhero team.
