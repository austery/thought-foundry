- We're replicating a
psychological experiment
about perceptions of discomfort.
(participant exhales deeply)
This is a bucket of cold water.
- Yep.
- You're gonna put your hand in
and you're gonna keep it
in there for a duration
that we won't tell you.
As it's in the water,
you can rate your
discomfort on this scale.
If basically you're at
the point where, like,
"I am in agony, let me
take my hand outta here,"
you can dial it up to that.
- Oh my God.
- Yep, can't feel my fingers
- Stinging.
- A bit achey.
- Arctic.
- Painful.
- Numb.
- Numb.
- Numb.
- [Participant] More pain.
- [Participant] Pain maybe.
- Pain, can't hold it.
- And obviously you've got two hands,
we'll be doing this three times.
I'm replicating an experiment
originally conducted
by Daniel Kahneman and
Barbara Fredrickson in 1993.
Just as in the original study,
I've told participants we're
investigating the difference
in pain perception between
dominant and non-dominant hands.
I'm assuming you're right-handed?
- Yeah, I'm right-handed.
- Okay.
But that is not the true
purpose of the experiment.
- Left-hand in.
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Ooh, it's cold.
- And we've started.
Yeah, all the way to the wrist.
That's good.
(participant exhales deeply)
What's the physical sensation like?
- Cold, (laughs) freezing.
- Yeah, there's like a point
where it almost feels like a muscle cramp.
- Both numbing and tingling.
- It is getting colder and colder, yes.
- [Host] Half of the participants
were randomly assigned
to use their left hand first,
the other half used
their right hand first.
They indicated in real time
how much discomfort
they were experiencing.
- It's getting like progressively worse.
- It feels cold.
I wouldn't wanna stay there
for very much very long.
- Good.
Are you from Russia or something?
- Yes.
- So you're used to the-
- I used to cold though.
(host laughs)
- At the end of the trial,
I told them to pull their hand out
and give an overall
rating for the experience.
- About a seven.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I mean, I wouldn't wanna swim in that.
- No.
- Three.
- Seven.
- Six.
- [Host] Then they took a 15 minute break
before returning to
submerge their other hand.
(intense suspenseful music)
- Yeah, I can't hold it.
- [Host] Bet that's real cold, huh?
- Yeah.
- I could probably go
another minute, I reckon.
- What about an hour?
- No.
- It's like stinging this time.
- It started to feel like
I can't feel my hand now.
Something like that.
- [Host] (laughs) Is that a
good thing or a bad thing?
- It's a bad thing, of course.
(both laugh)
- How did that feel?
- It felt a lot worse than my right hand.
(record scratching)
- [Host] What participants didn't know
is that the two trials were different.
They started out the same,
one hand submerged in
14 degrees Celsius water
for 60 seconds, and one
of the trials ended there.
But the other trial lasted
an additional 30 seconds.
During that time, the water
temperature increased slightly
to 15 degrees Celsius.
- Have I put it in here for longer
than I did last time?
Feels like it's been a while.
- [Host] This increase in
temperature reduced discomfort.
- It seems to make the
water slightly warmer.
It's slightly less uncomfortable.
- [Host] But it was still uncomfortable.
This is not the sort of thing
you'd wanna do for hours.
- No, I would like genuinely
just be dead right now.
(host laughs)
- [Host] Again, we randomized
whether the long trial
was first or second,
and whether it was with the
left hand or the right hand.
The ultimate question
was, "If I were to ask you
to repeat one of those two experiences,
which would you choose?"
- Probably the left hand, yes.
- You'd do that first one again?
- Yeah, I think so.
- I would say the second
one with the right hand.
- The first, the right hand.
- I'll go with the first.
- The first one?
- Yeah.
- In our small-scale replication,
seven out of 12 people said
they would rather repeat
the longer trial.
In the Kahneman and Fredrickson study,
this preference was even stronger
with almost 70% of their participants
preferring the longer trial.
That is the same trial
that they, in real time,
indicated was painful for a longer time.
Both trials contained the same 60 seconds
at 14 degrees Celsius.
The longer trial just added
an additional 30 seconds
with the water warming by just one degree.
This was still uncomfortable
and it was 50% longer,
and yet it's the trial
most people preferred.
One of the participants
in the original study
after reporting that he would prefer
to repeat the longer trial muttered,
"The choice I made doesn't
seem to make much sense."
So the first trial was 30 seconds longer?
- Yeah, okay.
- You endured discomfort for longer.
But at the end, the discomfort
reduced a little bit.
And the extra bit is not fun.
It's not like the extra bit
was like, "Oh, this is great.
I want to do this."
If I asked you which trial
you'd want to do again,
- Probably the first one,
- You'd tell me the first one.
- Yeah.
- And that's the one that's actually
a longer experience of discomfort.
- Yeah.
- [Host] As hard as it is to understand,
under certain circumstances, apparently,
people prefer more pain to less.
But why is this?
Well, to investigate,
Frederickson and Kahneman
ran a follow-up study
where they showed short
and long versions of pleasant
and unpleasant videos
to undergraduate students.
Examples of pleasant
videos included a puppy
playing with a flower,
- [Audience] Aww.
- [Host] And waves breaking on a beach.
While the unpleasant videos included
the aftermath of Hiroshima,
and a medical film
of an amputation.
- [Audience] Eww!
- After the video, students were asked
to rate their experience.
What they found was
the length of the video
had very little effect on
the retrospective evaluation,
positive or negative.
Kahneman and colleagues suggest
this is due at least in part
to the two different ways
we experience the world.
In the moment as the experiencing self,
or retrospectively thinking back on events
as the remembering self.
If you're going through
something unpleasant
and someone offers you the chance to stop,
you, the experiencing self,
will likely take them up on the offer.
But for the remembering self,
the duration of an experience
seems to have much less importance.
(plane engine revving)
This is known as duration neglect.
A 2008 study found that
the length of a vacation
did not have any impact
on how positively the
vacation was remembered.
So if the duration of an experience
doesn't affect your
memory of it, what does?
(light music)
(group laughing)
The answer appears to be key moments,
particularly ones that elicit
the strongest emotional response.
As the novelist Milan Kundera wrote,
"Memory doesn't make films,
it makes photographs."
And those photographs usually
capture the most intense,
salient moments of the experience.
The most joyful,
(child laughing)
funny, painful, scary moments in life
are the ones that are remembered,
and therefore they come to represent
the experience as a whole.
This is a version of the
representativeness heuristic,
A term coined by Daniel Kahneman
and Amos Tversky in the 1970s.
They were studying how people
think about probabilities.
Consider a family with six children.
Is it more likely that
they were born in the order
boy, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl,
or girl, boy, boy, girl, boy, girl?
For the majority of participants,
the first order was viewed
as significantly less likely.
But in reality, both
orders are equally likely,
but boy, boy, boy, girl,
girl, girl feels less likely
because it seems less random.
I mean, people have a
mental model of randomness,
and boy, boy, boy, girl, girl,
girl does not fit this model.
We rely on representativeness all the time
as a mental shortcut, but
sometimes it can lead us astray.
One famous example developed
by Kahneman and Tversky
is known as The Linda Problem.
Linda is 31 years old, single,
outspoken, and very bright.
She majored in philosophy.
As a student, she was deeply concerned
with issues of discrimination
and social justice,
and she also participated in
anti-nuclear demonstrations.
So which is more probable?
Linda is a bank teller,
or Linda is a bank teller
and is active in the feminist movement?
The majority of people
who are asked this question
give the second answer,
which makes sense because
the description of Linda
matches our mental model of a feminist.
But mathematically, it must be more likely
that she's a bank teller,
because feminist bank
teller is just a subset
of bank teller.
All feminist bank tellers are,
by definition, bank tellers.
Stephen Jay Gould said, "I know
that the conjoint statement
is least probable, yet a
little homunculus in my head
continues to jump up
and down shouting at me,
'But she can't just be a bank teller.
Read the description.'"
The thing about the
representativeness heuristic,
like many heuristics,
is that we fall for it
even if we are aware that
we're falling for it.
I mean, technically, eggplants, cucumbers,
and avocados are all berries,
but because they aren't small and sweet
like strawberries or blueberries,
we don't think of them as berries.
An eggplant does not match my
preconceived idea of a berry.
So even though I know
it's technically a berry,
I'm gonna keep calling it a vegetable.
I mean, the salient feature of an eggplant
is that I cook it like
I would a vegetable.
Also, annoyingly enough,
a strawberry is not technically a berry.
Botany is confusing.
So the representativeness
heuristic is why we think
that Linda is more likely
to be a feminist bank teller
rather than just a bank teller,
and why I can't bring myself
to call an eggplant a berry.
And representativeness is how
the peak moments in our past
come to represent entire experiences.
But it's not the only thing
that colors our perception of the past.
Our brains better recall
and therefore assign a greater importance
to more recent events.
This is known as recency bias.
So if you were to list
all the meals you had
in the last week, it
would be easier to recall
the most recent ones.
That's why how an experience
ends plays an outsized role
in how it's remembered.
I mean, how many people are rewatching
"Game of Thrones" right now, for example,
compared to, say, "Breaking Bad?"
I mean, the last season of
"Game of Thrones" was so awful
I don't think I'll ever
watch any of it ever again.
The end tainted my view
of the whole thing.
(wind whooshing)
And it seems like that also applies
when judging the quality of a life.
In a 2001 study,
researchers told a
fictional story about Jen,
a never-married woman without children.
She's extremely happy.
She has a job she enjoys,
many close friends,
goes on vacations and has
many fulfilling hobbies.
Then she's hit by a car at the age of 30
and dies painlessly and instantly.
Taking her life as a whole,
how desirable do you think Jen's life was?
For the other half of participants,
researchers told the same story about Jen,
but added another five years to her life.
Years that were pleasant,
but maybe not quite as
good as the first 30.
Then they asked the same question,
"Taking her life as a whole,
how desirable do you
think Jen's life was?"
And what they found was that
people judged Jen's longer life
to be less desirable.
That living for those extra
five good, but not great years
actually reduced the overall
perceived quality of her life.
The ending matters.
They repeated this same story with a Jen
that lives to age 60 compared to age 65,
and the results were the same.
Adding mildly pleasant years
to a very positive life
does not enhance it,
but actually decreases the perception
of the quality of this life.
So when it comes to holding your hand
in a bucket of cold water,
your overall experience of the event
boils down to two things,
the peak and the end.
Oh, yeah.
Like, I find that painful.
I can't believe people have been, like,
standing in front of us acting so tough.
Both trials involved holding
a hand in 14 degree water
for the same duration.
So presumably they created
the same peak of discomfort.
But the longer trial had a nicer ending.
Discomfort is backing off.
I mean, still uncomfortable,
but, like, not quite as uncomfortable.
By adding a slightly less
uncomfortable 30 seconds,
Kahneman and Frederickson were
able to trick participants
into remembering the
experience more fondly.
This is clearly a bad choice
for the experiencing self,
but a good choice for
the remembering self.
This might seem like an
insignificant party trick,
but it actually has huge
implications for our lives.
For example, if we remember
a medical procedure
like a visit to the dentist
or a checkup more favorably,
we're more likely to do it again,
and that improves
long-term health outcomes.
At the end of their 1993 paper,
Kahneman and Frederickson ask,
"Will a physician be allowed
to add an interval of diminishing pain
to the end of a medical procedure
if the sole benefit of the added pain
is to cause the patients to retain
a more favorable memory of it?"
In 2003, Kahneman did exactly that.
Along with colleagues,
he conducted a trial
with 682 patients who
underwent a colonoscopy.
Half of them went through
a normal routine procedure,
the other half had an extra three minutes
at the end of the procedure
where the tip of the colonoscope
was left in, but not moved.
So it was uncomfortable,
but less painful than the
rest of the procedure.
The patients who experienced
the extra three minutes
of discomfort at the end
rated the whole experience
as about 10% less unpleasant.
They were also more likely to come back
to do a follow-up screening procedure.
The peak-end rule also appears in design
for customer experiences.
The cheap hot dogs at the
exit of Ikea are an example.
The positive experience
of a cheap, tasty hot dog
or ice cream cone leads to a better memory
of the whole shopping experience.
It's like a doctor giving a lollipop
to a child after a checkup.
(gentle music)
Knowing that this is how
the brain creates memories
allows us to create better
memories for ourselves.
If you wanna run more,
don't do painful hill sprints
at the end of your workout.
Instead, maybe do a
pleasant cool-down walk
while you talk to a friend or
listen to your favorite music.
Wanna create better
memories of your vacations?
Making it longer won't matter as much
as creating exciting and novel days.
Make sure there's a high-peak experience,
and also end it with something pleasant.
Are you quitting your job
and want people to remember you fondly?
Well, make sure you are
extra nice to your colleagues
during your last few weeks.
In short, to create better
memories, you should optimize
for the peak and the end.
So the best way to close out
a YouTube video is, I guess,
with a wholesome message.
And why not footage of a cute
dog playing with flowers?
(celestial music)
Our mindset plays a huge role
in our perception of the environment.
And while this makes some
experiences seem more enjoyable,
it can also cause us to see things
as worse than they really are.
But luckily, you can train
your mind like a muscle
to make meaningful improvements
to your day-to-day life.
